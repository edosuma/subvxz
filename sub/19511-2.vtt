WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:04.067
Previously on "The Breaks."

00:04.133 --> 00:05.367
Fouray manufactures receipts
when he's on tour,

00:05.433 --> 00:06.633
and he pockets the cash
when he's reimbursed.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.200
You're gonna trust
this ho over your boy?

00:08.267 --> 00:09.667
--you talking about?

00:09.733 --> 00:11.900
I have this fantasy that
we would cut the album,

00:11.967 --> 00:13.733
and it saves hip hop
from going pop.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.667
Our audience is not interested
in the noise you call hip-hop.

00:16.733 --> 00:18.900
Hey, Bernard, this the kid
I was telling you about.

00:18.967 --> 00:21.500
Played that PE at WPPS.

00:21.567 --> 00:23.967
Let me know if you're ever
really ready to talk.

00:24.033 --> 00:25.200
Otherwise...

00:26.900 --> 00:28.200
Hands against the car.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.400
Wait--
What'd I do?

00:29.467 --> 00:30.900
You can't arrest him!
Deevee!

00:30.967 --> 00:32.700
Mr. Van Putten is my client.

00:32.767 --> 00:36.167
You call fuckin' Juggy to get
our friend out of jail.

00:36.233 --> 00:37.433
I'm supposed to just
let him sit in a cell

00:37.500 --> 00:39.200
because you got
daddy issues?

00:39.267 --> 00:40.533
So you the middle-man?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.100
No, I negotiate

00:42.167 --> 00:44.200
with the label
on behalf of the artist.

00:44.267 --> 00:45.633
Thanks for
your time, huh?

00:45.700 --> 00:47.867
Gonna start my own label.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.200
Better come on, boy.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.367
He might be snitching,
kid's gotta go.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.367
How long am I supposed
to be in here?

01:26.433 --> 01:29.167
You got somewhere to be?

01:29.233 --> 01:31.067
Nah, I...

01:31.067 --> 01:33.600
I mean, yeah,
I'd like to go home,

01:33.667 --> 01:36.067
take a shower
and whatnot.

01:36.067 --> 01:38.533
They got a shower
at the precinct.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.100
Didn't you shower
over there?

01:44.333 --> 01:47.300
Look, I--
I mean, nah--

01:47.367 --> 01:50.800
nah, um, I--
they didn't let me.

01:50.867 --> 01:53.533
What they let you do?
Nothing.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.067
What'd you tell 'em?
Nothing.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.333
You sure?

01:57.400 --> 02:00.200
Yes, I'm--
I'm positive.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.700
So we gonna work together.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.433
Most definitely.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.067
A'ight.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.067
Let's work.

02:40.133 --> 02:43.300
We should fight
more often.

02:43.367 --> 02:46.067
Mm-hmm.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.633
Oh-- what about in,
like, ten minutes?

02:48.700 --> 02:51.167
Stop being so stupid.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.933
Hey, should we try
Deevee again?

03:08.067 --> 03:10.433
Where?
He's not at his dad's.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.833
Oh, you don't think he went
back to Juggy's, do you?

03:13.900 --> 03:16.233
Last thing I need is
my best friend

03:16.300 --> 03:19.333
and my girlfriend hanging out
with Juggy all the time.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.733
David,
it was an emergency.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.067
I got it, I got it,
I'm-- look, I'm glad

03:23.100 --> 03:24.533
that Deevee is
not in jail,

03:24.600 --> 03:27.400
and I am glad
that Juggy was at home.

03:27.467 --> 03:28.867
Me, too.
Good.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.300
Can you come back
to bed now?

03:31.367 --> 03:33.700
Stop, I gotta go.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.800
You know if I'm on
the ground floor

03:35.867 --> 03:38.100
of Barry's new label,
then I'm part of the foundation.

03:38.167 --> 03:40.700
Yeah, but didn't you start,
like, yesterday?

03:40.767 --> 03:43.133
Let him feel you out
and... just, like,

03:43.200 --> 03:44.800
bring you along
at his own pace.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.833
If I'd've done that,
I'd've never gotten the job

03:46.900 --> 03:49.067
in the first place.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.600
I hear congratulations
are in order.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.500
You shouldn't have.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.767
Little Mattie Taylor.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.267
Head of black music.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.700
From promo assistant
to big office with a view.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.633
Not that I was ever
invited to the last one,

04:23.700 --> 04:26.100
but--
Well, clearly you don't
wait for an invitation.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.133
Well, I guess that's
the thing about foresight.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.900
Where would we be
if we waited for
what we wanted?

04:30.967 --> 04:33.100
So, black music.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.800
That's not where I left it,
that's for sure.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.867
But you got
a solid roster here, right?

04:37.933 --> 04:40.167
You got Keith Sweat, Tay Six.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.333
Don't forget Al B--
with that face and that voice,

04:42.400 --> 04:45.300
women all over this country are
gonna be wet with anticipation.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.900
Well, not every woman.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.233
What brings you by, Juggy?

04:50.300 --> 04:52.067
I heard you might be

04:52.133 --> 04:54.167
adding the hip hop
to your repertoire.

04:54.233 --> 04:57.633
My chairman says there's gold
in them-there hills.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.367
But he said that
about disco too, so.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.800
This might be different.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.133
My son David,
he's crazy about it.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.233
He thinks radio's gonna
catch on eventually.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.667
What do you say you and me,
we get out in front of this?

05:08.733 --> 05:09.967
Huh?

05:12.867 --> 05:15.967
Kids, what do
they know, right?

05:16.067 --> 05:18.067
I don't know.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.967
You want me to work
some records for you?

05:22.067 --> 05:23.400
Be just like
the old days,

05:23.467 --> 05:26.067
you know, but this time,
you call all the shots.

05:26.133 --> 05:28.233
That's really gracious
of you, Juggy.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.400
Hmm.
Are you also going
to allow me to choose

05:30.467 --> 05:32.233
which markets
I wanna push my acts in,

05:32.300 --> 05:35.933
or do you still owe
Cap Reynolds a favor for Tulsa?

05:36.067 --> 05:39.067
Oh, my, Mattie.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.267
No one's supposed
to know about that.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.333
Nobody does.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.900
About Cap--

05:44.967 --> 05:46.533
Never in
a million years.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.067
You don't wanna
hear me out?

05:49.100 --> 05:50.700
Juggy,
it was nice to see you.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.733
You heard the man,
he likes this.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.233
He's not even giving him
another song.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.800
Well, Tommy Boy is
going to drop him

06:06.867 --> 06:08.067
if he doesn't
deliver the song,

06:08.133 --> 06:09.300
which means that
he won't be able

06:09.367 --> 06:10.933
to finish the new album,
which means--

06:11.067 --> 06:13.067
Okay, that means that
we take a different approach.

06:13.133 --> 06:15.200
With D Rome?
With everybody,
with everything.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.933
We let Tommy Boy
drop D Rome.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.100
What?

06:18.167 --> 06:19.400
We're gonna let
Tommy Boy drop D Rome.

06:19.467 --> 06:21.733
and we're gonna sign him.
To what?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.067
Fouray Records.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.400
Barry, we don't have
the money for a label--

06:25.467 --> 06:27.367
I didn't have the money
when I started this company.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.300
You ever had a check
that bounced?
Actually--

06:29.367 --> 06:33.200
I just need a way to show him
that we're all about D Rome.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.067
You know, some way to show him
that he should believe in us.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.067
Something that
Tommy Boy won't do,

06:38.067 --> 06:39.600
something that
Gordy can't do,

06:39.667 --> 06:42.567
so that motherfucker stop
putting shit in D Rome head.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.600
The Ride concert.

06:44.667 --> 06:47.133
It's tonight.
Keith Sweat is
the headliner.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.433
Maybe we can get
Keith to let D Rome

06:48.500 --> 06:49.933
spit his verses
on that song.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.800
Live, in front of
thousands of screaming fans.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.600
That's insane.
That's a great idea, yeah.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.067
That's insane, that's exactly
why we need to do it.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.067
That's perfect,
that's a perfect idea.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.933
I love it, I love it,
I love it, Ms. Unreasonable.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.267
That's great, very--

07:02.333 --> 07:04.233
ahh-ahh-ahh,
where you going?
No, no-no-no.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.133
I need you to chill out here
and work on that business plan

07:06.200 --> 07:07.667
for the record label,
we need it perfect.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.133
Barry--
Stop, I don't even
wanna hear it.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.933
Come on, come on.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.700
Hey, what's up, D?
What's happening, man?

07:23.767 --> 07:25.233
King!

07:25.300 --> 07:26.533
What up, man,
you making love

07:26.600 --> 07:28.633
to some lucky woman
on-stage tonight? Huh?

07:28.700 --> 07:31.200
Ha-ha, Fouray.
What's up, baby?

07:31.267 --> 07:32.467
I know you ain't here
for a cut.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.967
Ah, man, no-no-no-no,
come on, come on.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.567
Stop, please,
I mean--
He's good.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.467
Recognize me, man.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.067
I ain't the one
with sharp objects.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.900
Keith, I need to holler
at you for one second

07:43.967 --> 07:45.367
about D Rome, though,
you got a hot second?

07:45.433 --> 07:47.500
Your boy is hot.
He killed the remix.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.500
That's what I'm saying,
so let's see if we can, like,

07:50.567 --> 07:53.067
work it out he perform
with you tonight on the stage?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.433
Hey, that's not
the blade you used last time.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.933
Remember how you sculpted
right above my ear?

07:58.067 --> 07:59.667
Do that again, baby,
come on now.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.400
So, what's up?
What you think?

08:01.467 --> 08:04.400
I mean, I guess so.
Is it cool with Bernard?

08:04.467 --> 08:06.433
Bernard? I don't need
to talk to Bernard,

08:06.500 --> 08:08.367
bring up the past,
for what?

08:08.433 --> 08:10.433
He only really care that
you headlining his show

08:10.500 --> 08:12.067
and not Sampson's show,
like, for what?

08:12.133 --> 08:13.967
Listen, you take
Anita Baker on the stage,

08:14.067 --> 08:15.867
Y'all do
"Make It Last Forever."

08:15.933 --> 08:17.500
Do you need
Bernard's permission?

08:19.267 --> 08:21.067
All right, baby,
you got it.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.233
Hey, bring your man
side of stage.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.967
I'll pass him the mic
before I'm done.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.733
Aah! That's what's up.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.100
We're out of
credentials.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.533
Man, my name is my pass.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.600
All right, hey,
I'll see you later, man.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.667
I'mma go get D Rome,
you go get Josie

08:40.733 --> 08:41.933
and meet me backstage.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.400
Look, make sure
that he look right

08:43.467 --> 08:45.233
and y'all are on time,
you got that?

08:45.300 --> 08:46.833
I got it, Barry.
Good.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.900
That'll give me some time
to-- to work Mattie Taylor.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.933
Listen, Nikki,
good idea.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.267
Very, very good idea,
I like that.

09:03.267 --> 09:05.533
Oh, shit, Barry!

09:06.433 --> 09:07.833
I need credentials.

09:55.233 --> 09:58.767
Have you ever tried to do,
like, a... like, a hook?

09:58.833 --> 09:59.767
What?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.267
You know,
like, a hook,

10:01.333 --> 10:02.933
like something that goes
in between everything

10:03.000 --> 10:04.933
so it doesn't sound
like you just...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.267
going on and on and on?

10:08.667 --> 10:12.133
I mean, people like
to sing along.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.633
I ain't singing.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.100
I know you're not
singing, but just...

10:16.167 --> 10:17.533
You think
my shit whack?

10:17.600 --> 10:20.033
No, no, no, man,
not at all.

10:20.100 --> 10:23.633
Then what the fuck is it?
You just a shitty producer?

10:23.700 --> 10:26.667
You don't know what the fuck
you're doing, huh?

10:26.733 --> 10:29.400
I know
what I'm doing.
What?

10:29.467 --> 10:31.067
I can't hear you.

10:31.133 --> 10:32.867
I-- I-- I just said

10:32.933 --> 10:35.133
I know what I'm--
I know what I'm doing.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.533
So you can make it work
without the hook.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.733
Then make it work.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.533
95.5, the Ride.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.100
Show some
New York City pride.

10:55.167 --> 10:58.033
Name this Brooklyn band
and this old-school jam...

10:58.100 --> 11:00.500
These are...
...two tickets
to Keith Sweat's concert...

11:00.567 --> 11:02.800
Man, Sampson'll
hate that.
Will he?

11:02.867 --> 11:04.967
Yeah, he thinks
he owns that account.

11:05.067 --> 11:06.767
Hah.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.233
Boy, I wish
I could've been there

11:08.300 --> 11:09.567
when you played
that record.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.967
Let me ask you
something.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.833
You knew he'd can you,
why'd you do it?

11:14.900 --> 11:17.300
Because I showed him
research that proved

11:17.367 --> 11:19.333
he could beat you
by playing hip hop,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.200
and he told me to stick
to getting his coffee.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.333
Yes?

11:36.567 --> 11:38.233
I need your help.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.067
What's wrong?
Is Deevee okay?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.333
No, it's nothing
like that.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.433
Barry got Keith Sweat
to let D Rome perform

11:43.500 --> 11:45.433
his verse on the remix
tonight, and--

11:45.500 --> 11:46.433
but they don't have
any credentials,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.400
and I need to get in.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.900
What?
Barry got
Keith Sweat--

11:49.967 --> 11:50.900
No-no-no, I got that,

11:50.967 --> 11:53.167
but I'm confused
why you're here.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.600
I need a credential.
Nikki--

11:54.667 --> 11:56.233
artists who are
scheduled to perform

11:56.300 --> 11:57.733
can't even
get passes, so...

11:57.800 --> 12:00.067
You don't understand,
David, I need to get in.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.367
You don't understand, I can't
give out any more passes.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.433
Okay, so just turn
your head away for a sec

12:05.500 --> 12:06.700
and get us an order.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.300
I can't do that, Nikki.

12:08.367 --> 12:10.133
David, it's me.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.567
I'm sorry.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.767
You know,
you're too good.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.267
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.733
It's not,
it's sweet.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.133
Nikki, I--
No-no,
it's okay, it's cool.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.100
I'll see you tonight?

12:45.900 --> 12:47.733
Yo, yo, cut it!

13:00.067 --> 13:01.967
Say something.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.800
You're just
not breathing.

13:06.067 --> 13:09.067
Uh, like,
you're not...

13:09.100 --> 13:11.467
you need to find
pockets to breathe in.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.067
Like, think of,
I don't know,

13:13.133 --> 13:15.433
like, every S-word
or something like that.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.367
Or if you don't wanna do that,
then we can just, you know,

13:18.433 --> 13:19.933
go line-for-line
and punch in.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.433
Punch? Fuck is
you talking about?

13:23.500 --> 13:24.667
Punch in.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.767
"Punch in" means,
like, to record,

13:26.833 --> 13:30.267
like, line right after
another line, like--

13:39.667 --> 13:41.600
Yo, we need to talk.

13:42.967 --> 13:44.733
Yo, get the fuck
out the hallway.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.200
Bounce.

13:50.367 --> 13:51.933
What happened?
Yo, Geronimo's crew

13:52.067 --> 13:54.900
called Bug over there about
Kennedy's men on some wild shit.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.767
What you mean?
They chopped
the nigger up, man,

13:56.833 --> 13:59.633
on some Freddy Krueger
shit, dog.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.433
What happened to you?

14:01.500 --> 14:02.867
Had to get his body
off the street.

14:02.933 --> 14:04.467
Ain't no motherfucker
see him that way.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.067
Go clean up.
All right.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.967
Hey, you running me, man?
Niggers need to move right now.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.667
That's exactly what Bruce
expecting us to do.

14:11.733 --> 14:15.500
Push now, we gonna have
half of Brooklyn on our ass.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.700
We gotta square it
with Bug's people.

14:21.933 --> 14:23.433
No doubt.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.800
Prep School.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.967
Not gonna work out.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.400
Call Scooter.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.967
Word.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.200
Thanks so much
for this again.

14:42.267 --> 14:43.767
Hey, no problem,
we'll get you in.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.233
Hey-- put this on.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.200
Oh, yeah, take--
Yeah.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.500
Hey, Nikki.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.633
Power up, dab some on.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.533
Yeah, you're good.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.300
Follow my lead.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.133
Hey, there, Josie Cho,
shooting the concert

15:14.200 --> 15:16.400
for Ebony Magazine.
This is my editor--

15:16.467 --> 15:18.800
actually, the editor
of Ebony Magazine.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.567
Ms. Monica Cole.

15:20.633 --> 15:23.167
Look, her flight got delayed,
and her luggage got lost.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.167
The luggage containing
her credentials.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.300
Look, I don't care if you're
the Margaret Thatcher,

15:27.367 --> 15:29.467
you ain't getting in here
without a pass.

15:32.067 --> 15:35.067
Wilkinson--
what's your first name?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.533
George.
Nice to meet you,
George Wilkinson.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.733
Can you direct me
to the nearest pay phone?
Why?

15:40.800 --> 15:43.867
Oh, Bernard Masters is my
neighbor and personal friend.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.100
I just wanted
to let him know

15:45.167 --> 15:47.167
what a fine job
his security was doing.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.233
Right this way, Miss.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.200
He's here.
That was great.

15:58.267 --> 16:01.300
Reminds me of sneaking
in to CBGB's when I was 13.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.167
13? Damn, girl, you didn't
look a little young?

16:04.233 --> 16:06.767
Power ahead,
worked then, works now.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.467
What're you doing here?

16:08.533 --> 16:10.300
I told you
I was coming.

16:10.367 --> 16:12.067
Barry got you a pass.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.433
Mm-mm, David, meet Josie,
my new friend.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.233
Josie, meet David,
he's my boyfriend.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.633
Oh, nice to meet you.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.167
Nikki, I'll see you
in the dressing room?

16:19.233 --> 16:20.733
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah,
thanks.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.867
So your girl
got you a pass.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.567
No.
Then who?

16:26.633 --> 16:28.200
Inquiring minds
want to know.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.967
Yeah, we do,
it's usually pretty hard

16:30.067 --> 16:31.900
to get into
a Ride concert.

16:31.967 --> 16:34.467
But, hey,
you are a hustler.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.900
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

16:36.967 --> 16:40.467
It's not,
it's, uh, sweet.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.133
...look,

16:43.200 --> 16:44.267
I'll find out
how you got in later,

16:44.333 --> 16:45.567
but I gotta get
this stuff upstairs.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.500
I'm feeling good
about tonight, baby.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.633
I-- we making a deal,
and I know-- I know

16:56.700 --> 16:58.733
Mattie Taylor's around here
somewhere, I can smell it.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.767
Really? And what're you
gonna tell Mattie Taylor
when you find her?

17:01.833 --> 17:04.067
I'm gonna tell her
the time is now to get
with Fouray Records.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.267
We about to blow up.
Prematurely.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.467
Dude, you are like
the fucking Grinch.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.067
We are not ready
to meet with Mattie.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.367
She know I got my ear
to the streets.

17:10.433 --> 17:11.933
She might not admit it,

17:12.067 --> 17:13.333
but she know
I'm what she missing.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.600
Are we talking about
the same Mattie Taylor?
Yes!

17:15.667 --> 17:17.533
Yeah, the one and only
Mattie Taylor.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.100
That's who we're
talking about, Grinch.

17:19.167 --> 17:20.567
Look, let's just
talk to her

17:20.633 --> 17:22.867
once we've got
some talent locked down.

17:22.933 --> 17:24.567
I hear you--
And some
production money.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.200
Please, this is the only shot
we get business with her.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.067
Okay, I'm gonna make
the shot count, I promise.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.667
It's gonna count.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.667
Hey, no doubt.

17:42.267 --> 17:43.667
Not even a wristband.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.300
Okay.

17:45.367 --> 17:47.133
Mr. Keith goes on
exactly 9:15,

17:47.200 --> 17:48.600
and we're closing
with "Make You Sweat."

17:48.667 --> 17:50.433
Have you go out there at 9:55,
can you do that?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.333
Yes.
Let me guess.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.067
The boss loaned
his lanyard.
Nope.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.433
Yeah, well,
you need an ID.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.800
So you couldn't get in
on the guest list.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.267
And you are not the type
to flirt your way in.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.433
You posing as somebody.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.767
Left some
poor guard shook.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.833
You could've just
given me the credential.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.467
Yeah, but where's
the fun in that?

18:12.433 --> 18:13.900
You clearly
don't need one.

18:16.733 --> 18:18.867
See you later.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.900
Damn it!

18:30.733 --> 18:32.533
Hello?
It's me, I got your page,
what's up?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.933
Nikki, oh, it's you,
I gotta talk to you.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.800
Yeah, what's up, what?
Yes, no, in person, okay?

18:38.867 --> 18:40.867
Um, where are you at?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.100
You hear this kid?
I'm telling you,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.667
this kid is the next
Michael Jackson.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.567
Orson, you remember
when you used to tell me

18:49.633 --> 18:51.167
that Little Foster Silvers

18:51.233 --> 18:52.767
was gonna be
the next Michael Jackson?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.100
I remember when he said
Jermaine Jackson

18:56.167 --> 18:58.333
would be the next
Michael Jackson.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.300
You know what,
now that we're on the topic

19:01.367 --> 19:02.967
of great '70s music, Orson,

19:03.067 --> 19:06.667
you really oughta license
my Bob James masters.

19:06.733 --> 19:08.200
You got his
late '70s albums, right?

19:08.267 --> 19:09.567
I got all the early ones.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.467
We could put out
a greatest hits CD.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.733
A million flat.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.800
Exactly what're you
doing these days, Juggy?

19:17.867 --> 19:19.633
Little of this,
little of that.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.233
I'm working records
for Mattie Taylor,

19:23.300 --> 19:24.467
that's what I'm doing
these days.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.933
I'm gonna call your bet.

19:27.067 --> 19:32.067
And I'm gonna
raise you a G.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.167
Mattie hiring you,
what for?

19:37.233 --> 19:39.533
She's got
a national staff now.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.267
She likes
my personality.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.933
I knew
you were bluffing.

19:46.067 --> 19:49.933
You cleaned me out here,
I gotta get back in the game.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.667
750K for the masters.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.900
You didn't pay more than
500 grand for those masters.

19:58.367 --> 20:01.067
Okay, 600,000.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.300
That's a tidy sum
for a day's work.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.567
What else
you wanna get rid of?

20:06.633 --> 20:07.967
Nothing.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.533
I thought
you were cashing out.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.600
Why would you think that?

20:13.900 --> 20:15.333
No reason.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.000
You got me looking like I'm
going to church or something.

20:23.067 --> 20:24.500
I'd love to got
to that church.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.067
Chill out, man,
you dope.

20:26.133 --> 20:28.333
The ladies gonna go crazy
when you step on the stage.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.267
Word up-- fresh, man.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.433
Yeah, you could
definitely catch it.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.567
For real?
Yeah...

20:40.967 --> 20:43.133
I don't know, babe,
got me feeling like

20:43.200 --> 20:44.533
I gotta sing
or something.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.267
I'm looking like
a real herb right now.

20:46.333 --> 20:49.300
You right about that shit.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.800
Come on, kid,
car's outside.

20:50.867 --> 20:54.233
You ain't performing
with no Keith Sweat, fuck that.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.867
All right, next band
is gonna have you

20:55.933 --> 20:59.200
in some phony rayon shirt,
polka-dot pants like you Kwamé.

20:59.267 --> 21:00.567
Uh-uh, hells no, let's go.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.167
No, we ain't going nowhere
but on that stage.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.167
Our headliner was born
right here in Harlem, U.S.A.

21:10.233 --> 21:13.333
Although he's been known on
the nightclub circuit for years,

21:13.400 --> 21:16.200
he made his living
on Wall Street.

21:16.267 --> 21:19.333
How's that sound?

21:19.400 --> 21:20.933
You wanna do it again?

21:22.567 --> 21:23.833
Yo, you had
that security guard shook

21:23.900 --> 21:25.367
like that white girl
in Rita's.

21:25.433 --> 21:28.367
Whatever, man,
where have you been?

21:28.433 --> 21:30.367
One of Ahm's guys
picks me up last night.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.667
I've been holed up
with him.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.167
He picked you up
to do what?

21:33.233 --> 21:34.167
Make music.

21:36.067 --> 21:37.833
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

21:37.900 --> 21:40.700
Bernard Masters
from The Ride, New York.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.200
As the voice of the people

21:43.267 --> 21:46.867
of New York City...

21:46.933 --> 21:50.533
I take great pride when
one of our own takes the stage.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.300
I love you!

21:56.367 --> 21:58.333
Whoo, I love you, too.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.167
I'd've been happy
to watch from the wings,

22:02.233 --> 22:04.300
but when my brother
called me personally,

22:04.367 --> 22:05.667
and he said, "Sampson,

22:05.733 --> 22:07.867
"the beautiful ladies
in the house

22:07.933 --> 22:11.367
"need your
special type of smooth

22:11.433 --> 22:14.100
to introduce my groove,"

22:14.167 --> 22:16.733
I had to come out.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am honored

22:20.067 --> 22:23.933
to give you
the crooner, the lover,

22:24.067 --> 22:28.367
the one that makes you
feel like no other.

22:28.433 --> 22:32.100
Give it up
for Mr. Keith Sweat.

22:51.967 --> 22:54.900
I thought Sampson
worked with PPS.
He does.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.333
That research
you did for Sampson,

22:57.400 --> 22:58.767
you still got it?

22:58.833 --> 23:00.400
Yeah.

23:00.467 --> 23:03.867
Meet me in my office,
first thing tomorrow morning.

23:03.933 --> 23:05.467
You're leaving?

23:05.533 --> 23:07.600
If I don't leave right now,

23:07.667 --> 23:09.767
I'll kill him.

23:14.367 --> 23:15.867
You ain't learned shit

23:15.933 --> 23:18.367
from the last time you tried
to pimp this man out

23:18.433 --> 23:20.300
for some New York
swing bullshit, man.

23:20.367 --> 23:23.133
Stra--
Yo, yo, hold on,
I found my man, D--

23:23.200 --> 23:25.733
You ain't find--
You're trying to ruin
this man's image--

23:25.800 --> 23:27.633
You found him?
That's right, I found D.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.067
You couldn't find
your own ass

23:29.067 --> 23:30.867
if you was wearing it
on your damn face.

23:30.933 --> 23:32.767
What've you done
for your man, D?

23:32.833 --> 23:35.067
The same shit I did for your
black ass back in the day--

23:35.133 --> 23:37.333
Oh, you steal his money?
You stole his money?

23:37.400 --> 23:40.167
I ain't steal no fucking money.
What, you got some proof?

23:40.233 --> 23:42.900
Damita?

23:42.967 --> 23:45.567
Yo, what's up?
You tell me.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.300
What is going on
with Barry and Gordy?

23:47.367 --> 23:49.833
Girl, nothing, they're
just business partners.

23:49.900 --> 23:50.967
You know,
they're passionate--

23:51.067 --> 23:53.900
Yeah, I do,
cut the bullshit, Nikki.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.400
You know I know you.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.467
Okay, okay,
but it's off-record.

23:57.533 --> 23:59.067
The hell it is,
if Barry Fouray

23:59.067 --> 24:01.567
and Gordy Charlton are fighting,
that's a story.

24:01.633 --> 24:04.067
What if I can give you
an even bigger story?

24:04.133 --> 24:07.500
I'm listening.
Fouray is about
to be a label.

24:07.567 --> 24:09.633
I could hook you up with
an interview with Barry.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.867
That's it?
That's a big deal.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.233
He won't meet
with just anyone.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.367
All-access,
behind the scenes.

24:15.433 --> 24:17.967
I'll do the best I can.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.667
Okay.

24:19.733 --> 24:22.567
But... you gotta
sing the song.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.200
What? Are--
you're kidding.

24:25.267 --> 24:26.800
Come on.
Guess I have a story

24:26.867 --> 24:28.733
about Barry Fouray
and Gordy Charlton.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.267
Wait-- wait, wait, wait.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.100
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

24:46.867 --> 24:47.800
Higher.

24:54.533 --> 24:55.867
Girl, you can do
better than that.

24:55.933 --> 24:58.100
Hop on the leg.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.833
I'm sorry.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.067
I'd like to meet her.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.567
I'd like that, too.

25:15.067 --> 25:17.067
Ten minutes.
Mm-hmm.

25:18.933 --> 25:20.900
Damn.

25:20.967 --> 25:22.200
Right?

26:09.133 --> 26:10.667
What's up?

26:10.733 --> 26:12.400
Smoke usually did this.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.167
Oh.

26:14.233 --> 26:16.333
All right,
so Bug have four corners

26:16.400 --> 26:18.267
and three years to 18.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.733
The way I think,

26:19.800 --> 26:22.233
Smoke started doing 19
after they knifed Disco.

26:32.533 --> 26:34.667
16 thou.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.967
Hold up, hold up.

26:43.967 --> 26:46.200
Could've made it to 21.

26:55.833 --> 26:57.867
I'm gonna pull
the truck around.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.167
R&B still bores you, huh?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.700
Oh, shit!

27:40.767 --> 27:42.267
Damita!

27:43.867 --> 27:47.467
Damit-- Damita Alonzo.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.767
Yo, you look good.

27:50.833 --> 27:53.400
You too, except for
a little sleep in your eye.

27:53.467 --> 27:55.367
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

27:55.433 --> 27:56.967
I'm fucking with you.

27:57.067 --> 27:59.333
Hah, funny, funny.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.667
I thought I heard somebody say
you were in New York.

28:01.733 --> 28:02.800
Yeah, I'm working
at the Village Voice.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.800
Oh, no shit?
Oh, that's dope.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.967
I mean, we could never get you
out of that hatchet office

28:07.067 --> 28:08.100
at G-Dub, so, you know.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.967
Maybe you didn't try
hard enough.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.433
So I guess
I missed my shot, huh?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.100
You said it,
I didn't.

28:25.233 --> 28:28.667
Yeah, yeah, wait till I tell
Bernard about your little plan.

28:28.733 --> 28:31.133
Oh, should've known
you'd brought your ho.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.433
You're acting like
a real dick right now.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.933
Where were you?

28:35.067 --> 28:38.100
Huh? You'll try anything
to make me look wrong, huh?

28:38.167 --> 28:40.067
Whatever.
You a sucka.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.767
I didn't even know
you was that kind of sucka--

28:43.500 --> 28:45.167
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be

28:45.233 --> 28:47.067
on the side of the stage
in, like, two minutes.

28:47.067 --> 28:48.833
You hear those two?

28:48.900 --> 28:50.933
I could be
in the studio right now.

28:51.067 --> 28:52.367
Yo, you hear that crowd?

28:52.433 --> 28:55.067
You gonna let a jacket
stop the guy from doing

28:55.100 --> 28:56.800
what he was put
on this Earth to do?

28:59.433 --> 29:01.200
Hell nah, sister.

29:01.267 --> 29:03.100
Good.

29:03.167 --> 29:05.133
'Cause you ain't wearing
that corny shit anyway.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.200
Yes! Yeah, boy!

30:10.267 --> 30:13.133
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.900
I told you,
I told you,
I told you.

30:14.967 --> 30:16.667
You killed it.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.667
Thank you so much,
New York, I love you.

30:33.733 --> 30:36.000
It's good to be home.

30:39.033 --> 30:41.433
Keith,
that's what's up,
man, word.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.267
Hey, good-lookin',
Keith.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.033
Oh, y'all taking my man?
Y'all taking my man?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.400
You good,
I'mma see you at Rita's.

30:48.467 --> 30:50.567
I'm gonna host a concert
for one of my artists,

30:50.633 --> 30:52.000
all you have to do is call.

30:52.067 --> 30:56.067
Well, here I am.
Ringing in your ear.

30:56.133 --> 30:58.967
How about the Tonys,
Labor Day Weekend?

30:59.033 --> 31:00.867
How about the Garden?

31:00.933 --> 31:02.700
Barry's
personal assistant.

31:02.767 --> 31:04.967
Haha, hey now,
don't worry.

31:05.067 --> 31:06.333
I'm a gentleman,

31:06.400 --> 31:08.667
even when being
face to face

31:08.733 --> 31:10.133
with a Judas-- security.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.200
Hey!
She don't even
have credentials.

31:12.267 --> 31:13.800
Get her up outta here.
Time to go,
let's go, come on.

31:13.867 --> 31:15.667
Hey!

31:16.933 --> 31:17.900
She's with me.

31:17.967 --> 31:19.967
With you,
Ms. Taylor?

31:31.767 --> 31:33.667
D Rome.

31:33.733 --> 31:35.333
That was a nice touch.

31:37.133 --> 31:39.433
What's your name?
Nikki Jones.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.267
Mattie Taylor.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.567
Would you like to join me
for a cocktail?

31:46.367 --> 31:48.500
So, what is it that
you wanna do, Nikki?

31:48.567 --> 31:49.800
I wanna be in A&R.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.433
Oh, really,
that's surprising.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.667
Mattie Taylor,

31:52.733 --> 31:54.267
it's very nice
to see you here.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.867
And I see that
you met my slave.

31:55.933 --> 31:57.567
Good to see you too,
Barry.

31:57.633 --> 31:59.233
Listen, I wonder
if me and you could build

31:59.300 --> 32:01.067
on distribution
for my new label.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.100
Oh, right, hip hop.

32:03.167 --> 32:05.233
Yeah, of course,
what else?

32:05.300 --> 32:07.533
What you got?
I got what you need

32:07.600 --> 32:09.400
to get on board
for distribution.

32:09.467 --> 32:11.100
All right,
call my office on Monday,

32:11.167 --> 32:13.067
we'll schedule
something.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.200
That's great,
I'll set it up, let's go.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.767
Come on, come on.
Barry.

32:17.833 --> 32:19.267
I need to use
the ladies' room,

32:19.333 --> 32:20.533
can I just meet you
downstairs?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.733
Uh, no-- no-no,
meet us at Rita's.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.433
We out of here.
Got it.

32:25.933 --> 32:27.067
Ms. Taylor.

32:27.100 --> 32:28.533
It's Mattie.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.067
Mattie.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.400
About A&R, what was
so surprising about that?

32:32.467 --> 32:34.700
I don't know,
just something about you.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.100
I don't get the sense
that you're the type

32:36.167 --> 32:37.800
to aim for the middle.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.133
Oh, I'm not.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.100
Hip hop is gonna take over
the music business.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.600
Fouray Records is
gonna be a force.

32:43.667 --> 32:44.933
Loyal, aren't you?

32:45.067 --> 32:46.500
I try to be.

32:46.567 --> 32:47.967
That's good.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.400
It'll carry you far.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.400
As long as you have
the right partners.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.567
Donald,
meet Nikki Jones.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.733
It's nice to meet you.

33:20.300 --> 33:22.633
Man, you gonna do it?

33:51.733 --> 33:52.800
Hey.

33:52.867 --> 33:54.933
Yo, we're here
about Bug.

33:56.133 --> 33:58.500
This is for you.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.533
I'm sorry
about your loss.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.533
Okay,
cool your jets,
Batman.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.267
I'm bad at that.

34:34.067 --> 34:35.333
When'd you get home?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.533
Just a minute ago.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.467
What're you doing
down here?

34:41.533 --> 34:43.600
I'm-- I'mma clean up.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.767
What you know about
Banks and Hampton?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.100
Baby Phee.

34:51.233 --> 34:54.833
Boy, you don't know nothing
about no Jack Ashford.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.933
Man, this takes me back.

34:59.067 --> 35:02.333
You know, we used to be
up on Marcy Av, blazing.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
They had a little hole
in the wall,

35:04.467 --> 35:06.067
right under the train.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.567
All the fine women, mm.

35:08.633 --> 35:10.367
That sounds dope.

35:10.433 --> 35:13.567
Yeah, it was that same club,
matter of fact,

35:13.633 --> 35:16.600
when I was dancing with
this fine, young lady.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.067
What was her name?

35:18.100 --> 35:19.600
Eh, don't make me lie.

35:21.067 --> 35:23.667
But I do remember
her boyfriend's name.

35:23.733 --> 35:25.133
Reggie.
Reggie.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.367
Reggie.

35:27.433 --> 35:29.500
Yeah, man, that was--

35:29.567 --> 35:31.533
that was the first time
I ever saw a gun.

35:32.733 --> 35:35.667
And it was pointed
right at my face.

35:35.733 --> 35:39.300
What-- What happened?
Huh?

35:39.367 --> 35:41.400
What happened?
Oh, I got shot at.

35:41.467 --> 35:44.167
What?!
Yeah.

35:44.233 --> 35:46.433
Bullet missed me
by less than an inch.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.733
Hit the wall behind me.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.700
And all I could
think about was you.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.067
Me?

35:55.067 --> 35:56.333
When was this?

35:56.400 --> 35:57.700
A couple of months
after you were born.

35:57.767 --> 36:00.067
Your mother was
already gone.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.267
You could barely lift
that big-ass head of yours.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.700
And you...

36:06.767 --> 36:09.067
were gonna need
your daddy.

36:11.267 --> 36:14.600
Look, son, I get it.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.600
You wanna be young,
do the music and all that.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.700
But you can't do nothing
if you're dead.

36:20.467 --> 36:24.067
Junior...
go down south.

36:25.467 --> 36:27.267
Got to your
Aunt Adona's house.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.167
Couldn't find you
after the show.

36:43.233 --> 36:45.067
Did you get my page?

36:45.100 --> 36:46.567
You know, you shouldn't
take the train back

36:46.633 --> 36:48.267
this late at night
by yourself.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.200
I took a car.

36:50.267 --> 36:51.767
Okay.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.600
Why are the lights off?

36:55.667 --> 36:57.967
I need to talk to you.

36:58.067 --> 36:59.533
With the lights off?

36:59.600 --> 37:03.133
I wanted to see
what it felt like.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.600
To sit in the dark?

37:04.667 --> 37:05.767
To be you.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.400
Sitting here alone,

37:07.467 --> 37:09.967
waiting for me to come home
so you could ask me about

37:10.067 --> 37:12.433
something or something
I did or said

37:12.500 --> 37:14.233
that you don't think
is right.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.233
What're we talking
about, Nikki?

37:26.500 --> 37:28.700
Juggy wasn't home
yesterday.

37:37.067 --> 37:38.533
I know.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.100
You know?

37:41.967 --> 37:47.200
Which means you called him
at his office phone.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.233
Which begs the question,

37:49.300 --> 37:51.267
how did you get
his office number?

37:54.400 --> 37:55.567
And you're not
gonna ask?

37:55.633 --> 37:57.800
No.

37:57.867 --> 38:01.067
If I ask, you're gonna think
that I didn't believe you

38:01.067 --> 38:03.333
when you assured me
that you hadn't told Juggy

38:03.400 --> 38:04.833
that Sampson fired me.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.933
You're also probably
gonna think that

38:07.067 --> 38:09.967
I concocted some theory
that you actually had

38:10.067 --> 38:12.133
talked to Juggy,
that you actually had

38:12.200 --> 38:14.400
told him Sampson fired me,
and that he then gave you

38:14.467 --> 38:16.700
his number so you guys
could talk without me

38:16.767 --> 38:18.467
finding out about it.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.333
Some theory.

38:25.767 --> 38:29.333
The truth is,
he's listed.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.767
You probably just...

38:30.833 --> 38:32.867
looked him up
in the phone book.

38:36.667 --> 38:41.633
Look, I know that
we're different.

38:43.067 --> 38:45.067
You bend the rules
a little.

38:45.067 --> 38:46.567
I write 'em.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.267
I hate my father.

38:48.333 --> 38:51.167
You admire him.

38:51.233 --> 38:53.200
And yeah, there is
a part of me that is worried

38:53.267 --> 38:55.933
that there is a part of you
that is like him.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.333
But you're not,
I know you're not.

39:00.833 --> 39:03.133
You would've told me
if you were.

39:06.067 --> 39:08.800
I might be more like him
than you realize.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.867
So, then... you are.

39:18.067 --> 39:21.267
I'm not judging you anymore,
Nikki, I love you.

39:22.467 --> 39:24.500
I can't change that.

39:24.567 --> 39:26.700
I love you, too.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.400
Now, when you're ready,

39:34.467 --> 39:37.267
I am prepared to pretend
we had the loudest,

39:37.333 --> 39:39.467
longest, nastiest fight
we have ever had.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.967
Okay?

39:45.467 --> 39:47.467
But before then,

39:47.533 --> 39:49.067
I need to take a shower.

39:49.067 --> 39:51.700
I am so funky,
I swear--

39:51.767 --> 39:53.567
staff at Ride
has taken

39:53.633 --> 39:55.267
some kind of revenge
on my white ass--

39:55.333 --> 39:57.567
they're working me
like a dog.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.767
Wait.

40:06.300 --> 40:08.100
I'm sorry, David.

40:08.167 --> 40:10.867
But I need you to put
your shirt back on.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.400
Let's get
the party started.

40:31.467 --> 40:33.100
Next time on "The Breaks."

40:33.167 --> 40:35.933
It's all here.
The money, the talent.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.400
This is what it's about
right now.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.467
I got a question
for Barry.

40:41.533 --> 40:44.133
You a leech, boss,
you just a leech--

40:44.200 --> 40:46.033
You wouldn't be
nothing without me!

40:50.333 --> 40:52.867
What is exactly is Fouray
gonna do for my baby?

40:52.933 --> 40:54.600
He's gonna
make her a star.
