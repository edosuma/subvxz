WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.525
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Friends,
we're almost at the end.

00:03.568 --> 00:06.441
And our Jane was approaching
the finish line as well.

00:06.484 --> 00:09.270
That's right,
she had finished her novel.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.880
You know, the one
based on her life.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.838
Oh, and she got herself
an agent.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.753
Yes! And in more good news...

00:14.797 --> 00:18.061
Rogelio's pilotThis Is Mars
got picked up to series.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.194
Unfortunately,
River Fields decided

00:20.237 --> 00:22.674
to move the show to New York. For my family.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.154
What about my family?

00:24.198 --> 00:25.982
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of giant moves,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.071
Rafael started working
for Petra,

00:28.115 --> 00:30.856
and Petra was determined
to expand the Marbella.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.859
I want a Marbella in every
major city, on every continent.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.687
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Might as well dream big, right?

00:35.731 --> 00:39.082
But not everything was dreamy. Remember our evil villain Rose?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.780
The one who kidnapped Mateo
and gave Michael amnesia?

00:41.824 --> 00:44.479
Well, Jane was determined to
confront her once and for all.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.350
If I can just say
my piece to her,

00:46.394 --> 00:48.004
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.397
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Only problem...

00:51.225 --> 00:53.227
Run!DENNIS: Because of Luisa,

00:53.270 --> 00:54.880
we were able to uncover Rose's

00:54.924 --> 00:57.057
escape plan and send in a team
to capture her.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.449
You're under arrest.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.712
Luisa betrayed me?Police!

01:00.756 --> 01:03.498
DENNIS: Unfortunately,
things didn't go as planned,

01:03.541 --> 01:04.977
and she escaped again.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.675
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, I'm afraid,

01:06.718 --> 01:09.199
is where we left off.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.376
Friends, after our
Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:12.420 --> 01:13.508
heard the news...

01:13.551 --> 01:14.944
Rose escaped.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.599
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, everything changed.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.035
We don't know
where she is,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.255
but Luisa's on her way
to a safe house in Belize.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.213
We feel certain she will
try to contact her.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.694
So my sister is bait?Oh, she insisted.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.784
She wanted to keep Rose away
from you and your family.

01:28.827 --> 01:32.396
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, well, from that moment on,

01:32.440 --> 01:36.748
our Jane was living in a constant state of anxiety,

01:36.792 --> 01:40.187
so her family stepped in
to help her cope.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.841
BOTH:
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

01:42.885 --> 01:44.713
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But despite their best efforts,

01:44.756 --> 01:48.456
our Jane remained traumatized.

01:52.373 --> 01:55.332
Always on edge.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.422
Afraid of what was lurking
around the corners,

01:58.466 --> 02:00.032
in the shadows.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.165
Yeah, it was the
air conditioner.

02:02.209 --> 02:05.299
I checked, no one
is outside.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.952
Are you okay?

02:06.996 --> 02:09.738
No. I hate
living like this.

02:09.781 --> 02:13.002
I know.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.440
Maybe it's time for you
to get professional help.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.142
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But
after talking and talking...

02:22.185 --> 02:23.360
I just can't talk anymore.

02:23.404 --> 02:27.016
I know, logically,
Rose isn't coming,

02:27.059 --> 02:29.497
but I can't shake this
feeling that there's

02:29.540 --> 02:32.021
something horrible
just around the corner.

02:32.064 --> 02:35.067
Which is no way to live.Exactly.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.200
And I need to figure out
how to manage my anxiety.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.290
I think maybe
you should try tapping.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.509
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't think tap dancing

02:41.552 --> 02:42.945
is going to solve this problem.

02:42.988 --> 02:46.383
One of the branches of therapy
I offer is EFT.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.301
It's a self-soothing tool,
based in acupuncture.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.477
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,
that makes much more sense.

02:53.521 --> 02:57.525
Every time you feel anxious,

02:57.568 --> 02:59.918
just tap along these meridians.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.055
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.319
Is it working?A little.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.409
Maybe? I have to remember
the tapping pattern,

03:12.453 --> 03:15.717
so that at least takes my mind
off of Rose. How was your day?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.066
Ugh, stressful.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.068
Petra keeps calling,
e-mailing and texting me

03:19.111 --> 03:20.461
every two seconds.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.463
She even had me paged
at the gym.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.595
I can hardly use the
bathroom without her...

03:26.641 --> 03:28.904
Relax, it's my phone.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.080
Maybe you should
start tapping.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.169
Ooh, it's my agent.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.779
You love saying that.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.128
I really do.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.043
I should talk to my agent.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.915
Hey, Lily.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.830
Okay, Jane, listen, I have news.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.179
Okay.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.485
Good news or bad news?

03:44.528 --> 03:45.790
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
In case you forgot,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.923
Jane is not a fan
of unexpected news.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.100
Oh, sorry. Sometimes I forget
how anxious you writers are.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.928
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Especially a writer
whose villain

03:52.971 --> 03:54.234
just broke out of prison.

03:54.277 --> 03:57.933
It's good news.
Publishers are loving your book.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.978
Oh, my God, really?

04:00.022 --> 04:01.023
Really.

04:01.066 --> 04:01.893
A couple editors
want to meet you,

04:01.937 --> 04:02.807
so I'm setting some lunches.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.201
Lunches?
Okay, sounds good.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.463
Sure does.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.291
I think you're gonna get
a good offer, Jane.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.379
Wow.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.816
That's great. Thank you.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.384
Yes, talk to
you soon. Bye.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.953
People like my book, and she
thinks I'm gonna get an offer.

04:17.996 --> 04:21.217
A good one, she said.What does that mean?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.306
I don't know! I mean,
I would be happy with 25,000,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.308
you know?
Thrilled with 50.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.615
100 would be... too crazy.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.487
I'd never get that, but can you
imagine if I got $50,000?

04:30.531 --> 04:33.490
Oh, and guess what else.
They want to take me to lunches.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.187
Multiple, fancy,

04:35.231 --> 04:37.320
free lunches! Ooh!

04:49.071 --> 04:51.334
So, I have
some good news.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.205
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, looks like Jane
already called her mom.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.729
What's going on?

04:54.772 --> 04:57.253
I got into a nursing program
in New York,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.429
so we can move there,

04:59.473 --> 05:01.866
if we decide to.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.346
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, different news.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.217
That's great.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is it?

05:05.261 --> 05:06.349
I'm mixed on this whole

05:06.393 --> 05:08.046
Ro-and-Xo-move-to-New-York
thing.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.310
I'm just so mixed
on this whole

05:10.353 --> 05:11.833
move-to-New-York thing.

05:11.876 --> 05:15.010
I know, but at least
one roadblock is removed.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.403
Hmm.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.147
Aw.Mm.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.716
So, should we talk
to Jane about it yet?

05:25.760 --> 05:29.720
No. She has enough on her mind
with all the Rose trauma.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.027
I-I don't want to get
into it until we know

05:32.070 --> 05:34.812
if Darci and Esteban are even
willing to move with Baby.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.988
Then we'll know
if we're actually going.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.948
Okay.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.646
Maybe we should try, uh,
Jane's tapping technique.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.737
Oh, good. You're here.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.044
How was the open house?Well, there were two clients

05:49.087 --> 05:52.003
that wouldn't really
leave even though they...That was a courtesy question.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.310
I don't care. Look, Clarissa
and her financial group

05:54.354 --> 05:56.007
love this property
for our first franchise.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.052
The building needs
to be razed,

05:57.095 --> 05:58.836
but what about that view?!

05:58.880 --> 06:01.143
We should go see it ASAP.
When can you travel?Oh.

06:01.186 --> 06:04.407
Petra, I... I can't, you know,
with Rose out there, and...

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
Oh. Yeah. No, I get it. I'll go.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.193
Y-You can make
the time up later.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.413
Obviously, there are
so many international hurdles

06:10.457 --> 06:11.632
we'll have to deal with
since it's a British

06:11.675 --> 06:13.634
overseas property,
but we'll chip away at them.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.375
Hopefully, we can close
the deal in 12 months.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.942
Yeah. That sounds great.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.075
You seem overwhelmed.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.556
I am... a little.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.645
Well... I get it.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.124
You're working two jobs.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.171
I know we had our worries
about working together,

06:29.214 --> 06:31.869
but things have been going
really well between us.

06:31.913 --> 06:37.179
So why don't we fully commit
to this partnership? Hmm?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.485
Quit your real estate
agent thing.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.182
Let's go all in.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.489
JANE:
What did you say?

06:42.532 --> 06:44.752
I said, "That makes sense."

06:44.795 --> 06:47.885
The thing is, I'm
torn about quitting.Why?

06:47.929 --> 06:49.365
There'll be a lot
of stress and travel

06:49.409 --> 06:51.454
and risk involved
with no guaranteed payoff.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.369
I mean, I could
spend years

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
negotiating the new franchise,

06:54.457 --> 06:56.111
and then nothing
could come of it.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.634
Well, you can't
live in fear

06:57.678 --> 06:59.462
of what's coming
around the corner.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.116
Huh. Well, it looks like

07:01.159 --> 07:03.248
somebody's learned a
thing or two in therapy.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.511
This is your dream.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.904
Go for it. Be brave.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.080
Hey, that's my line.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.605
Well, it's works, and it's true.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.781
Look who's getting
a free lunch tomorrow.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.391
I am so proud of you.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.263
You're gonna kill it.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.005
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, look at Jane,
ready to kill it,

07:21.049 --> 07:23.443
and by "it,"
I mean that free lunch.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.488
Hey, Lily, uh,
I just got to the restaurant.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.011
Oh, wait. I meant to ask you.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.622
Should I order
a glass of wine at lunch,

07:28.665 --> 07:29.884
or is that inappropriate?

07:29.927 --> 07:31.451
Jane, the editor's not coming.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.887
What? Why?

07:32.930 --> 07:34.018
We have a problem.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.194
Uh, what is it?

07:36.238 --> 07:38.980
Michael Cordero never
signed away his life rights.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.069
Without his permission,
the book can't be published.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.897
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup.

07:42.940 --> 07:47.031
There's always something
unexpected around the corner.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.431
Michael?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.433
None of us were
expecting that. Yup.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.914
And if he won't sign over his
life rights, there's no book.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.960
Well, you have to call him
and convince him.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.267
Yeah. I will.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.009
So, I guess I'll just...

08:08.052 --> 08:09.358
call him right now.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.273
I have the number
to the ranch.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.538
Rick?

08:15.582 --> 08:17.322
It's the ranch foreman.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.107
Um, uh, yeah, hi.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.978
I-I'm looking for
Michael-- or Jason.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.545
Michael-Jason.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.939
Oh. Really?

08:24.982 --> 08:26.984
Okay. Thank you.

08:27.028 --> 08:30.466
So, I guess Michael
took off a few days ago.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.599
Rick suggested I try
calling his mom.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.602
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Can't the guy just get
a freaking cell phone?

08:35.645 --> 08:38.518
So I'll just... call her now.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.043
Voice mail.Hmm.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.871
Hi, Patricia. It's Jane.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.960
Uh, can you please
give me a call back

08:46.003 --> 08:47.439
when you have a chance?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.746
Thank you. Hope all is well.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.270
Okay. So, hopefully,
she'll call back,

08:52.314 --> 08:53.924
and then we'll just...PETRA:
Rafael!

08:53.968 --> 08:55.447
Sounds like
she needs you.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.754
I have to get ready
for my shift anyway.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.542
Krishna! Pull up the preliminary
inspection reports

09:02.585 --> 09:04.848
on the Turks and Caicos property
to show Rafael.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.417
What were you looking at?Nothing.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.071
I'll remind you
of the Marbella's

09:10.114 --> 09:12.421
"no porn, no TMZ, no Goop"
Internet policy.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.858
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whew! I would not last there.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.122
Is that...?

09:18.166 --> 09:20.211
J.R.'s mother?I'm sorry.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.952
I promise I wasn't stalking
your ex-girlfriend.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.912
That would be creepy.
I just love obits.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.566
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
'Cause that's not creepy.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.707
Oh. I guess
J.R. will be in town.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.361
You okay?

09:39.404 --> 09:40.841
Yeah. fine.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.364
Krishna, let's see
those reports.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.759
What's this?ROGELIO:
All the reasons why

09:45.802 --> 09:48.979
moving to New York would be
incredible for you and Baby.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.942
God, you're a slow reader.
Let me just tell you.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.727
Did you know that New York
has the most single people

09:57.771 --> 09:59.773
per capita
in the entire country?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh.I should move there.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.647
And that single women outnumber
single men almost two to one?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Never mind.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.956
Those lonely souls need you
and your matchmaking skills.

10:08.999 --> 10:12.394
Oh...Also, New York has
the best pizza in the world!

10:12.437 --> 10:15.658
Plus, everyone is rude there,
and you love being rude.

10:15.702 --> 10:19.488
And have I mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio...?

10:19.531 --> 10:21.490
Rogelio, stop.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.014
You do remember
I'm from New York, right?

10:24.058 --> 10:24.972
I would actually

10:25.015 --> 10:26.364
love to move back there.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.628
Really? You would?

10:28.671 --> 10:31.761
But Esteban.
He loves Miami.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.895
The bozo even thinks Miami
pizza's the best in the world.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.811
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, Esteban.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.377
Gonna have
to disagree with you.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.208
PATRICIA :
Hi, Jane.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.080
Hi, Patricia.
Thank you for calling back.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.647
Uh, I didn't mean to bother you,

10:47.690 --> 10:48.952
but I'm trying
to track down Michael.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.388
Do you know where he is?

10:50.432 --> 10:51.868
I do, actually.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.610
MICHAEL :
Hi, Jane.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.787
Oh, uh, Michael, hi.

10:57.831 --> 11:01.182
I... I didn't know
you were in Florida.

11:01.225 --> 11:05.055
Yeah. I am.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.058
Uh, anyway,
I-I'm sorry to bug you,

11:08.102 --> 11:10.321
but I wanted to talk to you
about my novel.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.801
You probably didn't get it,

11:11.845 --> 11:13.890
but my agent sent over paperwork
for you to sign.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.762
Oh, I got it. I just...

11:15.805 --> 11:17.067
didn't sign it. Um...

11:17.111 --> 11:19.374
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.289
Which is actually
why I'm in town.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.595
Uh...

11:23.639 --> 11:25.902
So, what do you think?

11:25.946 --> 11:27.512
You have to meet him.

11:27.556 --> 11:30.298
It's your book.I know, but...

11:30.341 --> 11:33.605
He's making the effort to drive
all the way down here to see me.

11:33.649 --> 11:37.740
I-I'm worried
it's not just about the book.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.090
Well, I obviously don't think
it's about the book, either.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.397
I think he wants
to try to win you back.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.269
But I'm not worried about that.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.054
Good.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.882
Because I love you so much.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.666
I love you, too.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.234
Now go get those
life rights.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.758
Thank you for understanding.

11:55.802 --> 11:56.977
ROGELIO:
You're welcome.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.544
Someone just got you
a recurring role

11:59.588 --> 12:03.505
on This Is Mars.
You are back, baby!

12:03.548 --> 12:08.597
Biggest acting opportunity
of your life!

12:08.640 --> 12:09.859
No, thanks.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.644
What? Why?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.690
I've decided to quit acting.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.562
I've gotten really
into aromatherapy and Reiki.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.390
I'm committed to
being a spiritual

12:19.434 --> 12:21.610
and physical healer
of bodies and souls.

12:21.653 --> 12:25.309
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, so that's why he's dressed
like my yoga teacher.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.703
I have a higher
calling now.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.618
I truly want to help people.

12:29.661 --> 12:33.187
But why help a few scrawny
unwashed vegans

12:33.230 --> 12:37.060
when you can reach millions
of normal people

12:37.104 --> 12:38.583
by entertaining them?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.368
I get great satisfaction

12:40.411 --> 12:43.371
out of my one-on-one
interactions with my clients.

12:43.414 --> 12:47.070
Esteban, please, I will have to
give up on my dream

12:47.114 --> 12:51.248
if you won't move to New York,
because I cannot leave Baby.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.207
I wasn't a part
of Jane's childhood,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.818
and I won't make
that mistake again.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.646
Wow.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.823
What a tremendous gesture
of love.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.172
Baby is truly
blessed to have

13:02.216 --> 13:04.174
a beautiful person for a father.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.571
It was a beautiful plan,
but it backfired.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.529
I don't know what to do
about Esteban now.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.183
He's become a completely
different person.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.751
Then you have to remind him
of who he was,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.927
of what inspired him
to become a telenovela actor

13:17.971 --> 13:19.189
in the first place.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.756
Just think,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.845
what would remind you

13:22.889 --> 13:24.847
of why you love acting?

13:28.155 --> 13:31.941
Me.

13:31.985 --> 13:35.205
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of telenovelas...

13:41.429 --> 13:43.431
Hi, Jane.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.526
It's so nice to see you.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.137
And Bo.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.356
Nice to see you, too.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.316
Uh...

13:59.360 --> 14:02.537
So, you wanted to talk
about the book in person?

14:02.580 --> 14:06.062
Yeah. Um, we're not
totally okay with it.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.456
You and Bo?

14:08.499 --> 14:11.067
No, uh, me and my fiancée.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.895
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
If he's trying
to win Jane back,

14:12.939 --> 14:15.158
this is a weird way to do it.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.813
You're marrying Charlie?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.381
But she hates you.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.297
Yeah, well, not anymore.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.342
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess it's a shotgun wedding.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.564
Wow.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.913
Congratulations.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.567
I am so happy for you guys.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.916
Thanks.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.179
Now, let's talk about this book.

14:36.223 --> 14:39.574
I read it. I don't like it.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.707
Uh, okay. Why?

14:42.751 --> 14:45.449
Why? 'Cause Michael's
all over the damn thing.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.495
We live a quiet life.
We like our privacy.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.714
And frankly, this little book
of yours seems like

14:49.758 --> 14:50.977
it's gonna be
a big headache for us.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.761
So I don't want Michael
signing that paperwork.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.285
Please?

14:55.329 --> 14:57.766
Th-This book means
so much to me,

14:57.809 --> 15:00.812
and I've worked so hard
on it-- uh, for years.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.206
Sorry about that.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.165
You're a writer.
Write another one.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.647
Michael, please?

15:11.432 --> 15:13.173
This is a family decision, Jane,

15:13.216 --> 15:15.392
and I support
whatever Charlie wants.

15:19.135 --> 15:22.965
Well, this damn baby's
sitting on my bladder again.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.401
So, I better

15:24.445 --> 15:27.100
hit the commode,
as y'all like to say down here.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.537
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, no one says that.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.975
Please? Okay,
is there anything I can do?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.324
Does she want
more prize chickens?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.978
No. I asked.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.894
Look, I-I feel real
bad, but, you know,

15:38.938 --> 15:41.114
Charlie is my fiancée and
the mother of my child,

15:41.157 --> 15:43.333
and if she's uncomfortable
with all this,

15:43.377 --> 15:44.944
there's nothing I can do.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.684
ROGELIO:
I know you said no,

15:46.728 --> 15:47.990
but I have something
to show you

15:48.034 --> 15:50.036
that might change
your mind about acting.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.994
Rogelio, I have a sound
bath in ten minutes.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.343
I'll be quick.

16:18.368 --> 16:21.850
They're all... me.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.095
I am an incredible actor.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.618
Yes! I agree.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.403
And you can't throw
all this talent away.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.666
I can, actually.

16:56.754 --> 16:57.929
Why?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.975
Because I've played every part.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.977
And I stuck the landing
in all of them,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.023
not just in
Vault for Your Love.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.025
So, why keep acting?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.113
What else is there?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.115
Great fame in America.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.030
I am about to go
to a premiere party

17:11.073 --> 17:13.423
where my face will be
on every poster,

17:13.467 --> 17:16.122
every wall, every tablecloth.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.949
Reporters will be
taking my picture,

17:17.993 --> 17:20.735
and people will be fainting
when they see me.

17:20.778 --> 17:24.956
And it's going to be
the best feeling in the world!

17:25.000 --> 17:28.612
Funny. I-I can't even imagine
what that feels like.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.224
Which must mean
I've moved on.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.096
JANE:
Okay, well,
here's another idea.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.402
You go through the book,
and any details

17:35.445 --> 17:37.099
you're not comfortable with,
I'll take out.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.883
Well, I'm pretty sure
Charlie's uncomfortable

17:38.927 --> 17:41.451
with all the details that
have anything to do with me.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.932
Michael...
y-you're not being fair.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.629
I'm not being fair?No, you're not.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
Well, I don't exactly want to be
in this position,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.893
'cause I don't want to say no.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.070
Then don't. You know this book
means everything to me.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.941
And Charlie means
everything to me.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.771
Look, when you left,
I was broken.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.860
And Charlie
put me back together again.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.253
I know this
sucks, but,

18:00.296 --> 18:02.733
you know, I have to choose her
and her feelings.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.300
She's my partner.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.867
For life.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.043
CHARLIE:
Oh, baby.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.788
All right.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.181
We'll sign the
damn papers.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.095
Really?

18:16.138 --> 18:16.834
What?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.140
Yes, really. It's fine.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.794
MICHAEL:
Well, wait. Hold on, now.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.535
We-we flew all the
way from Montana

18:21.578 --> 18:23.537
so you could tell Jane
all the things you hated

18:23.580 --> 18:25.321
about the book,
and now you're fine with it?

18:25.365 --> 18:27.584
Michael,
let's take that yes.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.197
I didn't come down here
just for the book.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.243
I wanted to see if...

18:34.287 --> 18:36.593
y'all still had
anything between you.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.379
I mean,

18:39.422 --> 18:41.381
the way you went on about how...

18:41.424 --> 18:44.166
y'all were destined
to be together and how,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.081
when you saw him,
your heart would glow.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.865
Didn't exactly go down
like pickle juice.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.345
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Very little does.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.825
I get it.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.349
That was a long time ago.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.787
And I do think it was destiny.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.398
Now you're not helping.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.877
But I do.
Everything that's happened,

18:59.921 --> 19:01.488
all the moments
that led to this--

19:01.531 --> 19:03.533
you two finding each other--

19:03.577 --> 19:05.579
it couldn't have happened
any other way.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.148
I really believe that
to be true.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.282
What?

19:14.588 --> 19:17.243
I asked you once
if you still loved her.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.245
You said, "Yes. Forever."

19:19.288 --> 19:21.421
'Cause of what we had once.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.511
And 'cause she stuck with me
and helped me find myself again.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.341
Which led me to you.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.690
Hmm.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.262
Geez, she does cry a lot.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.177
See? I told you.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.179
So, we're good?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.572
No issues with privacy
or anything?

19:42.616 --> 19:44.966
Nah. No one I know would
ever read that book anyway.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.968
Huh. Okay, then.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.536
Oh, but could you just...
leave out

19:49.579 --> 19:52.103
this one part
right...

19:52.147 --> 19:53.714
there?

19:53.757 --> 19:55.542
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, she did.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.804
So I will, too.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.675
No problem. It's gone.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.203
Uh... Oh. There's one thing
you got wrong in the book.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.509
Um, Rose isn't 38.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.208
She's 51.
What? No.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.340
She's a plastic surgery
expert, remember?

20:11.384 --> 20:13.647
Wow. Okay.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.692
I will make that change.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.521
Goodbye, Jane.

20:18.565 --> 20:22.133
Goodbye, Michael.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.179
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And this time, friends,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.834
it really was goodbye.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.621
RAFAEL:
Don't go.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.581
A funeral is the absolute wrong
place to try to win back an ex.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.365
I wouldn't be trying
to win J.R. back.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.758
I'd just be going
to pay my respects.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.064
If you really want
to be respectful,

20:40.108 --> 20:42.850
then let her mourn
her mother in peace.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.244
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.724
So, have you quit
your real estate job?

20:47.768 --> 20:51.032
Not yet.
What? Why?

20:51.075 --> 20:54.514
Well, honestly, because
this project is gonna be a lot.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.472
And I'd need
to be all in.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.821
And I've already
missed dinners with the kids

20:57.865 --> 20:59.823
for the past few weeks,
and I don't want that.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.173
I totally get that.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.175
And I think I have a solution.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.874
Move back in to the Marbella.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.963
Your old penthouse
is vacant right now.

21:09.006 --> 21:11.357
Look, you, Jane, Mateo,
me and the twins.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.664
You'd have your whole family
under one very large roof.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.363
Plus, you'd have zero commute
and never miss a bedtime.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.278
Every night, I get to
put the girls to bed

21:19.321 --> 21:21.062
and then come right back
down here and keep working.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.759
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Lucky you.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.457
You're practically
living here already.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.806
Just think about it.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.940
Hey, I know you're busy,

21:29.984 --> 21:31.855
but give me a call back
when you're done.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.770
I have really great news.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.685
Do tell, Jane.

21:35.729 --> 21:38.601
What's the great news?

21:44.825 --> 21:46.740
I got to say, Jane,

21:46.783 --> 21:50.134
I'm a little disappointed.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.746
I was really hoping for Rafael

21:52.789 --> 21:55.139
since he's the one who
got me thrown in jail.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.141
But it's fine.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.926
You'll do.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.710
Aw.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.451
You poor little thing.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.540
Always in the wrong place

22:04.584 --> 22:07.021
at the wrong time, aren't you?

22:07.064 --> 22:09.806
I heard you came
to visit me in prison.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.331
Was there something
you wanted to say?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.550
'Cause I'm all ears.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.641
"After everything
you've done to me.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.600
"Kidnapping my baby.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.428
"Shooting my husband.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.125
"I think you're
the worst person

22:24.168 --> 22:26.388
in the whole wide world!"

22:27.781 --> 22:29.565
Aw.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.045
What's wrong?

22:31.088 --> 22:33.003
Cat got your tongue?

22:33.047 --> 22:34.396
Or villain got your cat?

22:35.702 --> 22:40.402
What do you w-want from me?

22:40.446 --> 22:44.537
Wh-What do I w-want from you?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.106
I'm glad you asked.

22:51.108 --> 22:55.417
I need Luisa to meet me

22:55.461 --> 22:57.288
at your father's
premiere party.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.814
And you're going to help me

23:00.857 --> 23:02.381
get her there.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.038
How?

23:09.039 --> 23:10.650
How? How could I do that?

23:10.693 --> 23:13.174
Very good question, Jane.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.610
I was thinking

23:14.654 --> 23:17.700
you call her up,
and you say something like,

23:17.744 --> 23:19.876
"Ditch the security guards
in Belize,

23:19.920 --> 23:23.445
"hop on Pan Atlantic 7859
to Miami,

23:23.489 --> 23:25.665
"and meet us at the party,

23:25.708 --> 23:27.928
"or Rose will kill
someone you love.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.234
"And if you tell anyone
Rose is holding me hostage,

23:30.278 --> 23:32.280
Rose will kill
someone else you love."

23:32.323 --> 23:34.195
Yeah, that should work.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.284
Have you got it,
or do you want to practice?

23:36.327 --> 23:38.982
P-Please. Please, you
don't have to do this.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.462
Pick up the phone and call!

23:46.033 --> 23:47.687
LUISA:
Hi. It's Luisa.It's her voice mail.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.428
Sorry I missed you.
Leave me a message,

23:49.471 --> 23:51.691
and I'll get back to you
when I can.Leave a message.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.477
Hi, Luisa. It's Jane.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.653
Rose is holding me hostage,

23:57.697 --> 23:59.742
and she said that if you
don't get on flight...

23:59.786 --> 24:02.571
Pan Atlantic 7859.

24:02.615 --> 24:05.269
...Pan Atlantic 7859 to Miami

24:05.313 --> 24:09.404
and meet her at my father's
premiere party, sh...

24:09.448 --> 24:11.798
she'll kill someone you love.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.541
And...?

24:15.584 --> 24:19.109
And if you tell
anyone about this,

24:19.153 --> 24:22.373
she'll kill another
person that you love.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
Please, call us back.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.769
Aw.

24:28.205 --> 24:31.339
Let's hope she does.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.776
It would sure be a shame
for someone

24:33.820 --> 24:36.953
to have to die
over an unreturned phone call.

24:38.999 --> 24:42.306
God, Mateo's
gotten so big.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.047
I haven't
seen him since...

24:45.353 --> 24:47.137
Oh, well, you remember,
of course.

24:47.181 --> 24:50.576
Please, please.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.798
It's an unknown number.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.365
It could be her.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.584
Put it on speaker.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.762
Hello?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.894
LILY:
Jane, it's Lily.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.766
Oh. Hi.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.116
I just got off the phone
with Little, Brown.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.552
They love your book.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.337
They're offering you 25,000.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.817
Oh, wow.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.515
Wow, that's great.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.951
Everything okay?

25:20.780 --> 25:23.347
Yeah, just... processing.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.915
Well, process quickly,
because they need an answer.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.874
So, what do you want to do?
Do you want to accept the offer,

25:27.917 --> 25:29.832
or do you want to roll the dice
and hold out for a better one?

25:29.876 --> 25:32.008
Here's the kicker: if you wait,

25:32.052 --> 25:33.923
Little, Brown could pull their
offer, and there's no guarantee

25:33.967 --> 25:36.012
that another publisher
is gonna step up and...

25:36.056 --> 25:37.623
We're willing to take that risk.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.625
This is Jane Villanueva's
attorney.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.496
Call us back
when there's a real offer.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.413
We have to keep the line open.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.329
Honestly, Jane,

25:48.372 --> 25:49.983
I just skimmed
your book,

25:50.026 --> 25:52.594
but I found it very compelling.

25:52.638 --> 25:56.250
I'm flattered that you made me
such a big character.

25:56.293 --> 25:59.340
Do you really think
I'm an icy beauty?

25:59.383 --> 26:01.951
That was a compliment, Jane.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.127
You could crack a smile.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.056
Have some water.
You look parched.

26:23.538 --> 26:27.020
It's Rafael. He was supposed to
meet me here before the party.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.804
Tell him to meet you there.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.589
And, Jane,

26:30.632 --> 26:32.416
if you alert him in any way

26:32.460 --> 26:35.071
or give him any kind
of secret code,

26:35.115 --> 26:36.682
I will kill Mateo.

26:42.426 --> 26:43.993
Hey, Raf.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.299
RAFAEL:
Guess where I am.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.866
My old penthouse.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.651
Oh.  What for?

26:49.695 --> 26:52.045
Petra offered
to let us move back in.

26:52.088 --> 26:54.613
And standing here, I'm just...

26:54.656 --> 26:57.224
I'm having
the most intense feeling.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.270
About where we started,
where we are now.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.536
Uh, wow, yeah.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.930
Well, it's definitely something
we should talk about,

27:07.974 --> 27:09.889
but can we do it later?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.325
Are you okay?

27:11.368 --> 27:13.109
You sound a little off.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.634
Y-Yeah, it's all good.
I'm just busy

27:15.677 --> 27:17.636
trying to get ready
for the party.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.941
Uh, let's meet there, okay?

27:18.985 --> 27:19.768
What?

27:19.812 --> 27:21.117
Why? I'm wrapping up here.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.293
I'll be home in... 30 minutes.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.512
No, don't come home!

27:24.555 --> 27:25.774
Why? What's going on?

27:27.167 --> 27:29.517
I'm just planning something
for you

27:29.560 --> 27:31.301
for the wedding,
and you can't see it.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.304
Oh. Sorry.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.524
But now I kind of want to know
what it is.

27:36.567 --> 27:39.266
Yeah. Bye. Love you.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.746
Ah! Okay.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.617
Okay, I'll see you at the party.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.010
See you at the party.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.796
Well done, you
pretty little liar.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.324
Why are you doing this?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.718
Luisa doesn't want to
be with you anymore.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.852
That's because you all
have poisoned her against me.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.810
No, it's...

28:01.854 --> 28:04.073
it's because
she doesn't love you anymore.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.510
She does love me.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.861
She doesn't.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.297
And I know it's
hard and painful,

28:10.340 --> 28:11.733
but people fall
out of love.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.082
Michael and I did.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.910
This is different.How?

28:14.954 --> 28:17.870
Because this isn't
your love story, Jane.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.872
It's mine.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.702
It's her.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.750
Hi, beautiful.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.796
I take it you got my message?

28:30.839 --> 28:32.449
LUISA:
I'll do whatever you want, Rose.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.886
Just don't hurt anybody.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.801
I'm on my way to the airport
right now.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.759
Fantastic.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.457
Yay! We're going to a party.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.068
Should we get dressed?

28:50.554 --> 28:52.034
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow, they really know

28:52.078 --> 28:54.167
how to commit to a theme
and run with it.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.385
There he is, there he is!

28:58.345 --> 28:59.912
Esteban, wow!

28:59.955 --> 29:02.088
Over here, Esteban!Look over here!

29:02.131 --> 29:03.524
Over here!

29:03.567 --> 29:05.569
Yes, Esteban!Take one photo.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.789
Esteban. Fantastic.Esteban.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.356
Over here, Esteban!

29:09.399 --> 29:11.401
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Esteban sure is

29:11.445 --> 29:12.489
working those Estebuns.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.626
That's weird.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.281
I still haven't heard from Jane.
She should be here by now.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.630
REPORTER:
Come on, get out of the way!Damn it!

29:22.673 --> 29:24.371
Those aliens are
in his shot.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.633
Move! Move!

29:25.676 --> 29:26.895
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Alas, friends,

29:26.939 --> 29:28.636
those aren't just any aliens.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.643
Looking good, guys.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.955
ROSE:
Grab a tray.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.218
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know Jane's had
some stressful days

29:45.261 --> 29:48.047
as a waitress, but this
definitely takes the cake.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.832
Don't worry. Once
Luisa meets us,

29:50.876 --> 29:52.660
you can enjoy
the festivities.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.575
Wait!

29:54.618 --> 29:55.663
Does Alba know it's Jane?

29:55.706 --> 29:58.187
May I have a drink?

30:02.539 --> 30:04.803
Let's go.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.284
Where's Jane?

30:08.328 --> 30:09.764
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She's right over there!

30:09.808 --> 30:11.070
Somebody help her!

30:11.113 --> 30:12.419
I don't know.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.073
Thought she'd be here
by now. Maybe...

30:14.116 --> 30:15.726
maybe she's running late.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.641
She said she was planning
some big surprise for me.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.730
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Look right, Rafael!

30:19.774 --> 30:21.645
Hey, so what'd you decide
about the funeral?

30:21.689 --> 30:24.648
I sent flowers and a note
to J.R. You were right.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.302
I didn't want to go
for the right reasons.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.869
I'm sorry.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.611
But you know
you'll fall in love again.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.656
It's only a matter of time.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.223
Maybe.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.661
Or maybe I'm just not meant
to couple up.

30:37.705 --> 30:38.880
Maybe it's not my destiny.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.839
I have a great life
without a partner.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.798
And honestly,
the Marbella satisfies me

30:43.842 --> 30:46.061
in a way I don't think
a lover ever could.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.542
I am so glad we got divorced.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.631
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And I'm so glad
this conversation is over,

30:50.674 --> 30:51.893
because Jane is in danger!

30:54.765 --> 30:56.506
Come on, Rafael.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.334
If anyone is going to realize

30:58.378 --> 31:01.120
it's Jane inside that costume,
it's her true love.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.730
So...

31:02.773 --> 31:05.211
did you think about moving in
to the Marbella?

31:05.254 --> 31:08.605
Um... I did, actually.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.129
ROSE:
What are you doing?

31:10.172 --> 31:12.566
It's hard for me
to move fast

31:12.609 --> 31:14.611
with this tray
of drinks.

31:15.612 --> 31:16.744
WOMAN:
Help! Save me!

31:16.787 --> 31:18.615
Somebody save me!

31:18.659 --> 31:21.880
On Mars, no one
can hear you scream.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.713
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, smart! A secret signal.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.846
He can't hear you,
but he can see you.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.458
ROSE:
What are you doing?

31:35.502 --> 31:37.025
Why are you slowing down?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.809
Sorry, this costume's heavy.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.861
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, no.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.907
Where is she taking her?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.345
Think of something, Jane!

31:52.388 --> 31:54.347
Wow. You move fast
for a 51-year-old.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.001
What did you say?

31:56.044 --> 31:57.785
No, I'm just impressed.
That's all.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.874
I am not 51.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.484
That's ridiculous.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.095
That better not
be in your book.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.928
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Did he see her?
He's so far away,

32:09.971 --> 32:11.712
and it's so dark up here.
I can't tell.

32:19.763 --> 32:24.681
Esteban Santiago,
you were a red carpet dynamo!

32:24.725 --> 32:26.727
Wasn't it amazing?It really was.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.555
For the first
time in my life,

32:28.598 --> 32:31.123
I felt like the star
I was born to be.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.168
So you'll come to New York?No.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.736
What do you mean, "No"?

32:35.779 --> 32:39.000
Tonight was great, which clearly
you had something to do with.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
But it wouldn't feel
like this in New York.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.004
This kind of
treatment is reserved

32:43.048 --> 32:44.614
for the stars of the show.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.790
I'd just be a measly
recurring character.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.358
It's not like I'd be
the lead or the villain.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.752
You want to be the villain?
You can be the villain.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.146
You're already the villain
in my life, so it's perfect.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.756
No. Forget it.
It was a bad idea.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.323
America will hate me.

32:57.366 --> 33:00.021
But they will love
to hate you, like I do.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.849
And all telenovelas
need villains.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.592
You'll have an incredible arc

33:05.635 --> 33:08.377
with huge twists and turns
all leading up

33:08.421 --> 33:10.423
to our epic confrontation

33:10.466 --> 33:13.382
with both our lives
hanging in the balance.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.819
Huh. If Luisa doesn't show up,

33:15.863 --> 33:17.647
you're gonna have plenty
of room on your side

33:17.691 --> 33:19.649
of the wedding aisle.
You know, I think I'll take

33:19.693 --> 33:21.260
your daddy out first.Shut the hell up, Rose.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.478
Just shut the hell up!

33:22.522 --> 33:24.089
You know what?
I'm not scared

33:24.132 --> 33:26.047
of you anymore.
I'm just freaking sick of you.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.614
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane, stop!

33:27.657 --> 33:28.615
You're going
to get yourself killed.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.095
I tell my son every night

33:30.138 --> 33:31.705
that monsters aren't real.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.099
But they are.
I'm looking at one.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.883
But you'll never win.

33:35.926 --> 33:37.928
So, wait. We are gonna do
the speech now?

33:37.972 --> 33:39.713
Because you know
what else I tell him?

33:39.756 --> 33:42.498
Good always triumphs over evil.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.718
You're right, sweetheart.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.634
I am evil, and I'm about to...

33:47.677 --> 33:49.679
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.725
Classic telenovela move:
distract the villain

33:51.768 --> 33:52.682
to buy more time.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.423
Run! Go!

33:54.467 --> 33:57.687
One more step, and Jane is dead.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.647
You know,
now that Rafael is here,

34:00.690 --> 34:03.519
I don't really
need two hostages.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.781
So you're disposable.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.742
Oh, Jane, cheer up.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.570
You'll probably sell
more books this way.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.137
LUISA:
Let them go!

34:12.180 --> 34:15.401
I won't go anywhere with you
if you touch them.

34:15.444 --> 34:16.706
ROSE:
No problem.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.535
I knew you'd come.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.407
I told you.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.148
Ours is the greatest

34:23.191 --> 34:26.238
love story ever told.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.153
It might be.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.155
But it ends now.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.852
What?

34:33.506 --> 34:36.074
Wh-What is that?Cyanide.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.641
My family will never be safe

34:38.685 --> 34:40.469
until I'm gone.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.864
No, Luisa! Don't.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.957
No!

34:50.000 --> 34:52.481
Goodbye, Rose.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.836
Was that a...

34:59.880 --> 35:01.795
Tic Tac?

35:01.838 --> 35:03.013
Wintergreen.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.802
You're in
for the most spectacular show

35:08.845 --> 35:10.717
you've ever seen!

35:14.416 --> 35:17.115
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG. I hope that killed her.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.769
Oh! Fire!

35:19.813 --> 35:21.684
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

35:21.728 --> 35:23.425
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, that definitely did.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.910
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall our heroine

35:29.953 --> 35:31.390
finally vanquished our villain.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.305
How are you feeling, Janie?

35:33.348 --> 35:35.916
Relieved. And guilty
for feeling that way.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.831
No way. Remember
how we all cheered

35:37.874 --> 35:39.528
when Catalina Creel died?

35:51.888 --> 35:53.847
Yeah. I am.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.025
My agent.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.419
Hey, Lily. Uh, look,
about yesterday...

36:00.462 --> 36:01.768
No, no.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.727
I heard your lawyer
loud and clear.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.207
Didn't quite need
her attitude.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.078
Yeah, sorry about
that. I fired her.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.645
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Literally.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.386
The point is,
I turned down the 25 K.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.953
I thought about it,
and the only way

36:12.996 --> 36:15.477
to get what you want is
to put the book up for auction.

36:15.521 --> 36:17.958
I've asked for first offers
by 3:00 p.m. today.

36:18.001 --> 36:21.091
Oh, wow.
Uh, but isn't that, uh...?

36:21.135 --> 36:22.745
Risky? Yes.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.965
So I want to prepare you.
We could get a lot of bids,

36:25.008 --> 36:26.401
or we could get none at all.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.011
But you said
you want to roll the dice,

36:28.055 --> 36:29.709
so be by your phone at 3:00 p.m.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.798
Keep your fingers crossed.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.408
Everything okay?

36:33.452 --> 36:35.105
I just hope Rose
didn't ruin my one chance

36:35.149 --> 36:36.411
at selling my book.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.196
You would have taken
the 25,000?

36:38.239 --> 36:39.806
No, I wouldn't have.

36:39.849 --> 36:43.070
But it'd be easier to blame
Rose if it doesn't sell.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.421
So...

36:46.465 --> 36:48.858
have-have you made
your decision?

36:48.902 --> 36:51.818
Yes, he has.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.910
I will take the part of
the incredibly handsome villain,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.042
and Darci, Baby and I
will move to New York.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.479
Yes.

37:00.522 --> 37:03.960
Yes!

37:04.004 --> 37:06.093
Oh, my God!

37:06.136 --> 37:07.964
You won't regret this.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.358
I promise you won't. Thank you.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.759
You did it, Smush!Yeah!

37:19.802 --> 37:21.891
I knew you could get a
giant part on his show!

37:21.935 --> 37:23.937
I know! How great an actor am I?

37:23.980 --> 37:28.158
I mean, the Reiki?
A higher calling than acting?

37:30.030 --> 37:32.772
Put on your spacesuit, Mush.
We're going to Mars!

37:32.815 --> 37:35.557
Oh!Ah! Mmm!

37:36.602 --> 37:38.343
It's from India.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.259
I hope you like it.

37:44.044 --> 37:47.830
Thank you... for
saving our lives.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.658
Oh...

37:49.702 --> 37:52.270
It was...
it was no big deal. I...

37:54.272 --> 37:56.926
I couldn't let anything happen
to you before your big day.

37:59.015 --> 38:02.541
We'd... really like you
to be there, actually.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.020
What?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.195
Come to our wedding.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.547
Please?

38:08.590 --> 38:11.114
I would love that.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.335
Thank you.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.163
Oh, my God.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.904
Have you thought
about the honeymoon?

38:17.947 --> 38:19.340
Because one benefit
of hiding out

38:19.384 --> 38:21.124
with an international
crime lord--

38:21.168 --> 38:23.866
you had to know a lot
of secluded spots.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.955
Oh, I don't think
we'll honeymoon.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.871
Raf is so busy with work
at the Marbella.

38:28.915 --> 38:32.788
Well, actually,
I quit last night.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.139
What? I thought
the Marbella was your dream.

38:36.183 --> 38:40.361
It was, but like
I told Petra,

38:40.405 --> 38:42.581
my dream has changed.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.105
I want time with my family.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.935
So, I'm gonna keep
my real estate job,

38:48.978 --> 38:52.939
and we'll save, buy a
little house down the line.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.811
Yeah?

38:55.855 --> 38:57.552
And you're okay with that?

38:57.596 --> 38:59.728
A... a little house?

38:59.772 --> 39:00.990
A smaller life?

39:01.034 --> 39:03.428
Doesn't feel smaller at all.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.563
: Oh, my God, Raf,
you've grown up so much.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.391
Aw.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.045
I...

39:12.088 --> 39:14.090
I can't wait
for your wedding, you guys.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.876
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Me, neither, but before
we get to the wedding,

39:16.919 --> 39:18.660
we have front-row seats
at an auction.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.402
Ah, what if nobody bids?

39:21.446 --> 39:24.100
Uh, what if
my book doesn't sell?

39:24.144 --> 39:26.407
Just take a deep breath.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.844
It's gonna be okay.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.240
First offer came in.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.895
10,000.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.767
Okay. Uh, we got one.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.596
Hey.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.990
10,000-- it's nothing
to sneeze at.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.426
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She turned down 25.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.125
20,000.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.258
Okay, we're
in the game.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.914
30! Oh, uh, thank you,

39:54.957 --> 39:56.829
faceless publisher,
whoever you are.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.134
Now I don't feel like
such an idiot

39:58.178 --> 40:00.136
for not taking that 25.Fist bump on that.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.312
Yup.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.837
40.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.101
50. OMG, Rafael. 50!

40:09.755 --> 40:12.627
Uh, it's Lily. Yeah.Okay.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.195
Hey, uh, everything okay?

40:15.238 --> 40:17.545
Yep. I just wanted
to tell you this one live.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.548
We're at 100,000, Jane.
Got to go.Thank you.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.116
100.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.857
One hundred...

40:24.900 --> 40:26.772
thousand... dollars!

40:30.558 --> 40:31.994
Oh.Oh.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.655
Oh. I got it, got it,
got it, got it, got it.Okay.

40:40.699 --> 40:41.874
LILY:
Jane?

40:41.917 --> 40:43.702
Uh, yes. Hi. Yes.

40:43.745 --> 40:45.181
The auction's over.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.792
We got your final offer.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.750
Uh, how much is it?

40:48.794 --> 40:50.491
500.

40:52.537 --> 40:57.019
Five... hundred...

40:57.063 --> 40:58.630
thousand.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.198
You did it, Jane.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.940
You did this.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.248
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And sometimes, friends,

41:08.291 --> 41:10.424
the unexpected can be magical.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.470
So much for a small life.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.821
Screw that. We're rich!

41:15.864 --> 41:18.127
Ah!

41:19.346 --> 41:21.914
Can you believe it?!That's our girl!

41:29.443 --> 41:33.316
Xiomara, this is good news.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.276
I know. It's just...

41:36.319 --> 41:39.888
we're not gonna be here
when the first check comes
