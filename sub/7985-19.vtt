00:03.541 --> 00:05.344
All the girls are here!

00:05.344 --> 00:07.481
JAI RODRIGUEZ:
<i>This season has been one</i>

00:07.481 --> 00:10.220
<i>devastating event after another</i>
<i>for Abby and the team.</i>

00:10.220 --> 00:14.295
REPORTER: Abby Lee Miller faces
up to five years in jail.

00:14.295 --> 00:17.502
Are you coming back to be
a part of the team at all?

00:17.502 --> 00:18.804
I'm not coming back.

00:19.873 --> 00:21.209
ABBY LEE:
Get out!

00:21.209 --> 00:23.748
<i>Yet somehow, they made it</i>
<i>through another season.</i>

00:23.748 --> 00:25.852
<i>The moms are set,</i>
<i>and Melissa</i>

00:25.852 --> 00:27.956
<i>is getting ready</i>
<i>for her final good‐bye.</i>

00:27.956 --> 00:30.060
<i>But Abby has just arrived.</i>

00:31.797 --> 00:34.836
PRODUCER:
<i>What's she doing?</i>

00:34.836 --> 00:36.540
All right, so let's get
this makeup on the road.

00:38.844 --> 00:42.552
Some of the jewelry is
in the suitcase.

00:42.552 --> 00:44.523
Why are we always
waiting for her?

00:44.523 --> 00:45.324
WOMAN: <i>We need you on stage.</i>

00:45.324 --> 00:47.027
ABBY LEE: <i>I had no idea</i>

00:47.027 --> 00:49.733
<i>till five minutes ago.</i>

00:49.733 --> 00:51.570
Careful. Careful.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.306
PRODUCER:
Oh, here comes Abby.

00:53.306 --> 00:54.743
The moms are already
down out there?

00:54.743 --> 00:56.446
BRYAN: Let's hear it
for Abby Lee Miller!

00:56.446 --> 00:57.649
(cheering, applause)

00:57.649 --> 01:01.189
MELISSA:
Really? We're chopped liver?

01:01.189 --> 01:02.659
This does not happen every day.

01:02.659 --> 01:04.362
Just lettin' you know.

01:04.362 --> 01:05.898
Aah! I need a different bra.

01:05.898 --> 01:07.134
MELISSA: Why?

01:07.134 --> 01:08.136
Abby, you just got out here.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.205
I know.

01:09.205 --> 01:11.209
It's, like, poked out
instead of against me.

01:11.209 --> 01:13.179
It's making the shirt
poke out.

01:13.179 --> 01:14.382
MELISSA: Now you
just ruined it.

01:14.382 --> 01:16.419
No, look. Look.
Wait.

01:16.419 --> 01:17.555
WOMAN:
Girls, let's go!

01:17.555 --> 01:20.494
Time to get on stage.
Get on stage.
(laughter)

01:20.494 --> 01:21.530
ABBY LEE:
This should be against me.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.299
I get that. Hold on.
I got it, I got it.

01:23.299 --> 01:24.903
Six. Where's the seventh?

01:24.903 --> 01:26.674
Hey, Jai, we're out of time‐‐
just toss to a dance.

01:28.944 --> 01:31.149
RODRIGUEZ: <i>While Abby</i>
<i>gets herself settled in,</i>

Yay! Finally!

03:26.780 --> 03:28.784
(cheering, applause)

03:28.784 --> 03:31.155
Hey, everyone!
I'm Jai Rodriguez,

03:31.155 --> 03:33.961
and welcome to <i>Dance Moms:</i>
<i>Hello and Good‐bye.</i>

03:33.961 --> 03:36.132
Now, like all of you,
I'm a <i>huge</i> fan

03:36.132 --> 03:38.269
of the show,
and tonight we say hello

03:38.269 --> 03:40.975
to Brynn and the minis,
and good‐bye

03:40.975 --> 03:42.779
to the Zieglers.
And, of course,

03:42.779 --> 03:45.350
the girls will perform some
of their award‐winning dances.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.321
But first,

03:47.321 --> 03:49.559
give a warm welcome
to the cast of <i>Dance Moms!</i>

03:49.559 --> 03:50.962
(cheering, applause)

03:50.962 --> 03:53.433
We have, of course,
the fabulous....

03:53.433 --> 03:55.538
Abby...
(cheering)

03:55.538 --> 03:57.441
Jessalynn...

03:57.441 --> 03:59.078
Holly...

03:59.078 --> 04:00.180
Ashlee...

04:00.180 --> 04:01.315
Melissa...

04:01.315 --> 04:02.819
Jill...

04:02.819 --> 04:04.355
and Kira.

04:04.355 --> 04:06.125
(cheering, whooping)

04:08.162 --> 04:09.264
Hi, Abby.

04:09.264 --> 04:10.266
How are you?
Good.

04:10.266 --> 04:12.104
You look gorgeous.
Thank you.

04:12.104 --> 04:13.574
Excited to be here.
I didn't blow smoke‐‐

04:13.574 --> 04:15.010
I am a huge fan of the show.

04:15.010 --> 04:17.347
And I think your contribution
to dance around the world

04:17.347 --> 04:19.719
has inspired
so many people.
Thank you.

04:19.719 --> 04:22.357
So thank you so much.
Thank you.

04:22.357 --> 04:24.228
Now, I don't know

04:24.228 --> 04:27.835
about you guys, but this season
I was <i>glued</i> to the TV.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.371
So let's dive
right in.

04:29.371 --> 04:30.440
Abby, how did it feel

04:30.440 --> 04:31.843
to find out that the Zieglers

04:31.843 --> 04:33.814
were leaving
the way you found out?

04:33.814 --> 04:35.450
ABBY LEE:
Well,

04:35.450 --> 04:37.187
I expect more from Melissa.

04:37.187 --> 04:38.924
You know,
I‐I just think

04:38.924 --> 04:40.226
it's very odd that...
I did it

04:40.226 --> 04:42.130
through the proper channels‐‐
just like when you have

04:42.130 --> 04:44.134
a contract on Broadway and say,
you know what,

04:44.134 --> 04:45.971
something comes up better,
you go in and say,

04:45.971 --> 04:47.274
"I wanna give
my two weeks' notice,

04:47.274 --> 04:48.744
something came
up better."
That's what you do.

04:48.744 --> 04:51.883
Okay?
But you don't lie
to the director and the producer

04:51.883 --> 04:53.520
for months on end

04:53.520 --> 04:55.023
going into it‐‐
they all know

04:55.023 --> 04:57.762
there was an audition and you
went to it and you told them.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.298
The director and the producer
and the lawyer

04:59.298 --> 05:00.868
and everybody knew about it.
You can think

05:00.868 --> 05:03.306
whatever you want‐‐
I know the truth.

05:03.306 --> 05:06.011
(laughter)
But what have <i>you</i> heard, Abby?

05:06.011 --> 05:07.782
Just between us girls.
Come here.

05:07.782 --> 05:09.886
My student is going

05:09.886 --> 05:11.155
to go on and judge

05:11.155 --> 05:12.959
<i>So You Think You Can Dance.</i>

05:12.959 --> 05:14.963
(cheering, applause)

05:14.963 --> 05:16.165
And I am...

05:16.165 --> 05:18.369
thrilled beyond belief
because I will be able

05:18.369 --> 05:20.473
to get tickets every single week

05:20.473 --> 05:22.077
(laughter)
to that show.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.212
I am thrilled!

05:24.716 --> 05:27.287
Well, they're not allowed
to talk about it.

05:27.287 --> 05:30.895
Maddie, <i>So You Think You Can</i>
<i>Dance,</i> what's happening there?

05:30.895 --> 05:32.197
Hashtag #NotMyShow.

05:32.197 --> 05:33.166
(laughter)

05:34.301 --> 05:35.971
RODRIGUEZ:
Jess, you look like you're

05:35.971 --> 05:37.642
about to say something‐‐
what are you thinking here?

05:37.642 --> 05:39.244
Well, I want to go back
to Abby's reaction.

05:39.244 --> 05:42.184
Because Abby cried for hours
when Melissa told her.

05:42.184 --> 05:43.554
ABBY LEE:
This woman sat

05:43.554 --> 05:45.156
in my mother's hospital room.

05:45.156 --> 05:46.593
Right, I get it.

05:46.593 --> 05:48.162
Like,
we're all happy
Day after day

05:48.162 --> 05:49.364
for her.
after day
after day.

05:49.364 --> 05:50.801
Why would I not be happy?

05:50.801 --> 05:52.672
JESSALYNN: Right, okay.
But I‐I agree with that.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.609
We're all very happy,
but, like, when we said,

05:54.609 --> 05:56.378
should we plan a party,
should we do something,

05:56.378 --> 05:58.750
you were like,
"No, nothing."
Well, because all

05:58.750 --> 06:00.955
that I was asking for
when I said,

06:00.955 --> 06:02.457
and still continue to say,

06:02.457 --> 06:04.729
is there should have been
a press conference

06:04.729 --> 06:06.833
with you, me, Maddie
and Mackenzie sitting there

06:06.833 --> 06:09.104
telling the world that this was

06:09.104 --> 06:10.340
a positive, wonderful,

06:10.340 --> 06:12.110
great thing happening...
That's what

06:12.110 --> 06:13.847
we're trying to do.
and...

06:13.847 --> 06:16.485
that this had nothing to do
with Pittsburgh or the ALDCLA.

06:16.485 --> 06:19.391
The girls would
continue their training

06:19.391 --> 06:22.230
and their work under their
teacher and under my tutelage.

06:22.230 --> 06:23.567
How many times have I said that
the last week?

06:23.567 --> 06:25.169
That's what
should have been done.
Well...

06:25.169 --> 06:27.875
It should have been done...
properly.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.579
I feel that it was
through my attorney.

06:29.579 --> 06:31.516
I don't think so.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.952
(audience murmuring)

06:32.952 --> 06:34.789
RODRIGUEZ: Holly,
you're an original team member,

06:34.789 --> 06:36.593
so, I mean, do you feel that she

06:36.593 --> 06:38.362
handled it correctly?
Intellectually,

06:38.362 --> 06:41.168
I totally understand it
and respect it,

06:41.168 --> 06:42.605
but on a personal level,
Oh, as do I.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.976
it was hard, I think,
for many of the moms

06:44.976 --> 06:46.880
when we were reading it
in the tabloids,

06:46.880 --> 06:48.784
when Melissa
would continuously say,

06:48.784 --> 06:51.055
"It's a lie, it's a lie,
they're gossiping."

06:51.055 --> 06:52.992
We're like, "Melissa...
'Cause it <i>was</i> gossip then.

06:52.992 --> 06:55.631
Melissa,
it really was... not, Melissa.

06:55.631 --> 06:58.637
And I think that's the part
that wasn't as truthful.
MELISSA: Yeah, it was.

06:58.637 --> 07:02.077
One of the articles was Maddie
actually doing the interview.

07:02.077 --> 07:04.816
Whether it was true or not,
the tabloids printed it
It wasn't.

07:04.816 --> 07:06.251
that it was a quote
from Maddie.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.822
She didn't say
she was leaving the team.

07:07.822 --> 07:09.625
ASHLEE: I was the one
who brought it up,

07:09.625 --> 07:11.830
because I read it for myself
on my‐‐ I mean...
Well, because...

07:11.830 --> 07:14.401
you're, like, a troublemaker‐‐
you like to cause drama.
No. And it <i>was</i> real.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.804
And you did call me a liar.

07:15.804 --> 07:16.806
HOLLY: Melissa,
I don't...

07:16.806 --> 07:18.677
as your friends,
we're telling you,

07:18.677 --> 07:20.781
it wasn't quite fine.

07:20.781 --> 07:22.350
It is, it is what it is.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.022
I just feel that...

07:25.022 --> 07:27.828
I should always be
the first to know, not the last.

07:27.828 --> 07:30.667
RODRIGUEZ: Let's take a look
at that moment when

07:30.667 --> 07:34.575
Melissa shared that she, Maddie
and Mackenzie would be leaving.

07:34.575 --> 07:38.650
MELISSA:
I appreciate you and everything
you've done for my kids,

07:38.650 --> 07:40.754
but after this season,

07:40.754 --> 07:42.023
we're just gonna...

07:42.023 --> 07:43.627
not be on the elite team
anymore.

07:45.864 --> 07:47.400
My question is,

07:47.400 --> 07:50.306
Maddie is signed,

07:50.306 --> 07:52.945
sealed and delivered
to shoot the Sia movie.

07:52.945 --> 07:54.214
Yeah.
So she's not doing

07:54.214 --> 07:55.416
anything else

07:55.416 --> 07:56.753
between the movie and now?

07:56.753 --> 07:58.590
Um...
I don't want
to see them

07:58.590 --> 08:01.195
on <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i>
<i>Kids,</i> I don't want...

08:01.195 --> 08:03.165
them doing
anything like that.
Don't worry,

08:03.165 --> 08:05.169
Maddie's not gonna be, um...

08:05.169 --> 08:07.340
dance on <i>So You Think</i>
<i>You Can Dance,</i> kids.

08:07.340 --> 08:09.177
Maddie's not going
on it, so...

08:09.177 --> 08:11.048
All right.

08:11.048 --> 08:13.252
We have four more competitions.

08:15.056 --> 08:16.860
We have...

08:16.860 --> 08:17.995
we've been here for a long time.

08:17.995 --> 08:20.567
(sniffles)

08:27.046 --> 08:31.623
I‐I didn't want to even think
about it, to be honest with you.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.459
(sniffles) I just
always want you

08:33.459 --> 08:34.729
to be proud of 'em.

08:34.729 --> 08:36.566
(crying): I'm proud of them.
I know you are.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.473
Abby, I mean, look, you're
getting emotional about this.

08:40.473 --> 08:42.043
There's clearly a lot of love
for these girls

08:42.043 --> 08:43.345
and a lot of passion behind it.

08:43.345 --> 08:44.414
MELISSA: Of course
she loves them.

08:44.414 --> 08:47.120
ABBY LEE: This is not
to take away from Maddie,

08:47.120 --> 08:49.457
but they would not have the life
that they have today

08:49.457 --> 08:50.761
if it was not for me.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.932
And I put aside

08:52.932 --> 08:54.869
my personal life, my...

08:54.869 --> 08:57.741
(applause)
my own... income,

08:57.741 --> 09:00.279
my own everything...
for those kids.

09:00.279 --> 09:02.985
You have to be happy
for Maddie moving on,

09:02.985 --> 09:05.156
going to do that.
I said that a hundred times.
I'm thrilled.

09:05.156 --> 09:06.559
Because you don't
seem thrilled, though.

09:06.559 --> 09:10.132
No, I am still trying to keep
a studio in Pittsburgh

09:10.132 --> 09:12.938
alive and going, and the...

09:12.938 --> 09:17.013
public just doesn't understand
the difference between the show

09:17.013 --> 09:18.950
and our real life.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.656
So when they see the kids
leaving the ALDC,

09:21.656 --> 09:22.925
that's wrong.
HOLLY:
But right there,

09:22.925 --> 09:24.427
you're thinking
of yourself.
Yeah.

09:24.427 --> 09:25.931
Give them <i>their</i> due.

09:25.931 --> 09:28.035
(applause)
They have given a lot
to be a part of this

09:28.035 --> 09:29.270
and they deserve

09:29.270 --> 09:31.909
more than what they were given.

09:31.909 --> 09:33.112
Well, they're gonna go get more.

09:33.112 --> 09:35.016
(cheering, applause)

09:36.218 --> 09:37.487
Okay, so we're gonna move on,

09:37.487 --> 09:38.790
we're gonna move on.
(chuckles)

09:38.790 --> 09:41.395
Jill, now,
with Maddie leaving the group,

09:41.395 --> 09:43.065
what does this mean now
for Kendall?

09:43.065 --> 09:45.469
I‐I don't...
I really don't know.

09:45.469 --> 09:47.541
I'd love to say that Abby,
you know,

09:47.541 --> 09:49.679
thinks Kendall can do it,
and will...

09:49.679 --> 09:52.450
will do whatever she
can to get Kendall...

09:52.450 --> 09:53.953
ABBY LEE:
Put it this way.
what she's done for Maddie.

09:53.953 --> 09:56.091
Uh, Kendall has
a new song coming out.

09:56.091 --> 09:57.493
She has been working
on her voice.

09:57.493 --> 09:58.963
It's stronger now.

09:58.963 --> 10:02.070
So I want her to go back in
and rerecord two of the songs

10:02.070 --> 10:03.506
that she already did.

10:03.506 --> 10:06.044
So we're gonna try
to do that. And then...

10:06.044 --> 10:08.048
the single will come out,
and three months following that

10:08.048 --> 10:10.954
should be the album‐‐
so that's all in the works now.

10:10.954 --> 10:13.906
(applause)
Well, that‐that's nice
to hear you say that, 'cause...

10:16.136 --> 10:17.233
We're here talking finitely
with the momst moment for Abby

10:17.233 --> 10:19.471
of ALDC and, of course, Abby.

10:19.471 --> 10:21.441
Now, Ashlee,

10:21.441 --> 10:22.678
so the moms were, like,

10:22.678 --> 10:24.548
really angry with you
this season. Why?

10:24.548 --> 10:26.318
ASHLEE:
I think

10:26.318 --> 10:29.357
anybody who came in under the
pretense of Maddie's replacement

10:29.357 --> 10:30.694
was going to have
a hard time

10:30.694 --> 10:31.963
no matter...
But she wasn't

10:31.963 --> 10:33.566
replacing Maddie.
No one was ever

10:33.566 --> 10:34.735
replacing Maddie.
That's why I came in
though, Jill.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.937
That's the pro...
We had a problem with it.

10:35.937 --> 10:37.775
In pyramid,

10:37.775 --> 10:39.979
Abby said, "Maddie's not here,

10:39.979 --> 10:42.049
so I have the next best thing.
Here's Brynn."

10:42.049 --> 10:44.187
And brings her in,
'cause she was supposed
(scoffs) Such a joke.

10:44.187 --> 10:45.991
to dance
where Maddie was dancing.
Don't do that to a national

10:45.991 --> 10:48.295
winning team. You don't come in
and say, "My kid's the best,

10:50.166 --> 10:51.936
MELISSA:
And my daughter has won
so many competitions,

10:51.936 --> 10:54.107
and I've never once said
my daughter was better

10:54.107 --> 10:56.344
than any of these kids here.
Have I?
It was because

10:56.344 --> 10:57.748
you guys were saying
negative things about Brynn

10:57.748 --> 10:59.450
right off the bat. Jill,
No, you're wrong.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.388
you called her stupid
to her face.
I would love to...

11:01.388 --> 11:02.490
You said
she had no brain,

11:02.490 --> 11:03.593
to her face!
Okay, well,

11:03.593 --> 11:05.396
I didn't say it to her face‐‐

11:05.396 --> 11:06.866
I said it to Abby.
RODRIGUEZ:
Okay,

11:06.866 --> 11:08.001
let me ask you
a question, Abby.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.270
Is Brynn

11:09.270 --> 11:11.274
the new Maddie?
She has not

11:11.274 --> 11:13.813
had my training, with me.

11:13.813 --> 11:17.086
However, in time,
she will be.

11:17.086 --> 11:18.590
RODRIGUEZ:
How does that make you feel?
Nobody's

11:18.590 --> 11:19.925
gonna ever be the new Maddie.

11:19.925 --> 11:21.796
So it doesn't make me feel...
anything.

11:21.796 --> 11:22.931
'Cause Maddie

11:22.931 --> 11:25.402
can't be replaced.
And Abby knows that.

11:25.402 --> 11:26.973
Well, let's take a look
at some of the chatter

11:26.973 --> 11:29.612
about Brynn being
the new Maddie.

11:29.612 --> 11:32.116
Look, here goes Kendall.
Brynn's right in front of her.

11:32.116 --> 11:34.120
JESSALYNN:
<i>Look at her. Why doesn't</i>
<i>she just move and let</i>

11:34.120 --> 11:35.122
Kendall, like, dance?

11:35.122 --> 11:37.126
Go sit down
where Kendall sat.

11:37.126 --> 11:38.128
<i>I can't stand</i>

11:38.128 --> 11:39.297
Ashlee thinking Brynn

11:39.297 --> 11:40.700
is the next Maddie.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.673
<i>Kendall K has been groomed</i>
<i>to be the next star.</i>

11:43.673 --> 11:45.543
<i>There's a pecking order here</i>
<i>at the ALDC,</i>

11:45.543 --> 11:47.881
and, sister,
you're on the bottom.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.286
Is Abby and the choreographer
both in there?
Yes.

11:50.286 --> 11:52.591
If it was a problem, they would
tell her, don't you think?

11:53.927 --> 11:56.231
I think so.
I think if Brynn

11:56.231 --> 11:58.201
had a brain in her head,
she would know to back off.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.638
Do not call my child stupid.

11:59.638 --> 12:01.074
If she had a brain in her head,
I am not gonna
sit here

12:01.074 --> 12:04.347
she would see that. Back off!
and listen to you bash my kid!

12:04.347 --> 12:06.484
The real reason that Jill
is angry is that Kendall

12:06.484 --> 12:09.424
has invested five years
into this team and doesn't have

12:09.424 --> 12:10.660
<i>a whole lot to show for it.</i>

12:10.660 --> 12:11.729
The reality is

12:11.729 --> 12:13.566
maybe Kendall
already had her shot.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.002
I just want
to get this straight.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.171
You want Brynn
to do the solo.
Jill...

12:16.171 --> 12:17.874
You're gonna stick up
for Brynn...

12:17.874 --> 12:20.245
I'm sticking up for the child
that's in the room
that's helping.

12:20.245 --> 12:22.884
Are you kidding me?!
You never trained that kid!

12:22.884 --> 12:25.824
You never taught her
a (bleep) thing!

12:25.824 --> 12:27.828
Why can't Kendall
just open her own mouth and say,

12:27.828 --> 12:29.665
"You're in my way. Move"?
Why can't Brynn

12:29.665 --> 12:32.003
have a brain
and sit in the back?!

12:32.003 --> 12:34.240
(audience murmuring)

12:34.240 --> 12:35.977
JILL: Yeah, well,
you know what? Listen,

12:35.977 --> 12:37.647
I'm not mad at you,
and I wasn't mad at Brynn.

12:37.647 --> 12:39.484
I was mad at Abby
for comin' in,

12:39.484 --> 12:41.154
not putting
a stop to it.

12:41.154 --> 12:43.793
Kendall's been with Abby
for eight years now.

12:43.793 --> 12:46.565
She had never taught Brynn
anything.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.337
Why wouldn't Abby take care
of her student?

12:49.337 --> 12:50.472
That's how I saw it.

12:50.472 --> 12:51.575
ABBY LEE:
Brynn is coming in‐‐

12:51.575 --> 12:54.982
or any child that comes in now‐‐

12:54.982 --> 12:57.253
from the competition world,
from auditioning,

12:57.253 --> 12:59.090
from it going to
dance conventions,

12:59.090 --> 13:01.829
where there's 800 students
on the floor

13:01.829 --> 13:03.465
and they're vying
for that spot

13:03.465 --> 13:05.335
in the front and the middle.
They're trying to get noticed

13:05.335 --> 13:06.972
by the choreographer.
(applause)

13:06.972 --> 13:08.141
That's what
she's coming from.

13:08.141 --> 13:09.945
JILL:
Right.
So she's walking

13:09.945 --> 13:11.515
into something,
trying to prove herself,
I get that.

13:11.515 --> 13:13.786
trying to show me

13:13.786 --> 13:15.389
she's fabulous,
that she can do whatever
I disagree with you.

13:15.389 --> 13:16.559
we throw at her.
And I think you're...
That's a cop‐out.

13:16.559 --> 13:18.361
Because Kalani never

13:18.361 --> 13:21.234
came walking in,
shoving people out!
That's what she should be doing!

13:21.234 --> 13:23.806
Kalani came in
and meshed with the team

13:23.806 --> 13:25.442
and danced

13:25.442 --> 13:27.046
with the team.
ASHLEE:
You guys

13:27.046 --> 13:28.716
were the reason why she had
a hard time fitting in.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.154
It had nothing to do
with the way she acted.
If a kid doesn't

13:31.154 --> 13:33.626
fit in, that's because
of what the mother

13:33.626 --> 13:35.062
has done.
JILL:
You came in

13:35.062 --> 13:37.868
picking on everybody's kid.

13:37.868 --> 13:40.205
And you didn't
know your place.
(audience reacts)

13:40.205 --> 13:41.374
Interesting. I think

13:41.374 --> 13:42.944
you called her boring.
My child.

13:42.944 --> 13:44.748
You called her boring. You said
I never called
her boring.

13:44.748 --> 13:47.687
she was stupid. You said...
Nope. I never called her boring!

13:47.687 --> 13:49.323
She repeated it!
I repeated what

13:49.323 --> 13:50.259
other people said.

13:50.259 --> 13:52.062
And that makes
it okay?
Yeah.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.465
It's all real.
I know!

13:53.465 --> 13:54.535
It's all real.
I know. I'm feeling it.

13:54.535 --> 13:55.904
I'm feeling the electricity.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.406
ASHLEE:
Problem really was

13:57.406 --> 13:59.377
they don't want anybody
coming in on this team.

13:59.377 --> 14:01.949
And they don't like
that they couldn't run me off.

14:01.949 --> 14:03.485
RODRIGUEZ:
The dance world

14:03.485 --> 14:05.690
can definitely be cutthroat.
And if you aren't careful,

14:05.690 --> 14:07.694
you just might get
the axe.

14:07.694 --> 14:10.767
After the break, the mini moms
will join us onstage.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.637
And you know what that means‐‐
a little more drama.

14:12.637 --> 14:13.806
But first,

14:13.806 --> 14:15.442
here's Maddie performing
"Lizzie Borden."

Please welcome Kerri,
<i>Coming up...</i>
SARI: <i>I felt like</i>

16:20.993 --> 16:22.129
Tiffanie,

16:22.129 --> 16:25.870
Sari, and Yolanda.

16:27.941 --> 16:30.111
being new to ALDC meansmoms,

16:30.111 --> 16:31.648
you have pretty big shoes
to fill.

16:31.648 --> 16:33.819
Has it been difficult trying
to fit in?

16:33.819 --> 16:36.424
It's been the hardest thing
to come here and

16:36.424 --> 16:39.430
try to, like, fit in the least
bit. I mean, we're all scared

16:39.430 --> 16:42.604
and trying to get on the team.
And it's been rough.

16:42.604 --> 16:45.710
Scared? Girl.
JILL: Just don't tell us
what you sacrificed

16:45.710 --> 16:47.814
for two weeks. 'Cause we've
been doing this for years.
Bingo!

16:47.814 --> 16:49.216
I don't want to hear
the word "sacrifice."

16:49.216 --> 16:50.485
RODRIGUEZ:
Now, Sari,

16:50.485 --> 16:53.692
you just came off
a very emotional competition.

16:53.692 --> 16:55.696
Want to tell us
a little bit about that?

16:55.696 --> 16:59.069
Abby is actually the first
person, the first choreographer,

16:59.069 --> 17:00.907
who has given my daughter

17:00.907 --> 17:03.679
a chance to dance for a reason.

17:03.679 --> 17:06.384
Something special,
my‐my son.

17:06.384 --> 17:10.191
And it was
a very, very emotional moment.

17:10.191 --> 17:12.697
My son has cerebral palsy.
My son

17:12.697 --> 17:14.701
had a anoxic brain injury

17:14.701 --> 17:16.738
happen at a hospital. And...

17:16.738 --> 17:18.041
I felt like

17:18.041 --> 17:21.848
my son and his situation
was downplayed.

17:21.848 --> 17:23.451
It was hurtful.

17:23.451 --> 17:26.190
Well, we have that moment
on tape. Let's take a look.

17:26.190 --> 17:30.866
♪ ♪

17:30.866 --> 17:32.469
It's really neat that you got
the solo this week

17:32.469 --> 17:33.839
for your son.

17:33.839 --> 17:35.308
He's coming, right?
I know. Yes.

17:35.308 --> 17:36.177
Oh, he's coming?

17:36.177 --> 17:37.279
The nurse
is coming,

17:37.279 --> 17:38.616
my parents.
Everybody's excited.

17:38.616 --> 17:39.918
They're really, really excited.

17:39.918 --> 17:42.289
Oh, that's great.
Ari was nervous,

17:42.289 --> 17:44.293
but I think that... I think that
this is definitely something

17:44.293 --> 17:46.063
that she can be...
You know, this is

17:46.063 --> 17:47.600
supposed to be Maddie
and Mackenzie's, like,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.738
great week for fun stuff
and all this,

17:49.738 --> 17:52.009
and now it's not even‐even
about my kids at all.

17:53.679 --> 17:57.687
KERRI:
Sari, you were talking about how
excited your disabled son was

17:57.687 --> 17:59.490
coming down here
to watch your daughter dance.

17:59.490 --> 18:02.095
And Melissa
only worried about her kids.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.832
You know what?
This is my kids'
That's rude.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.805
last week here, honey.
Make it nice, okay?

18:06.805 --> 18:09.209
Your kids laid the platform
for every one of your kids

18:09.209 --> 18:10.613
to come in
and be in there.

18:10.613 --> 18:12.449
MELISSA:
I mean, I'm sorry
about your son,

18:12.449 --> 18:13.619
but this is about Maddie
and Mackenzie.

18:13.619 --> 18:15.155
I'm not trying
to be rude, because

18:15.155 --> 18:17.593
I feel terrible
that you have had this life.

18:17.593 --> 18:19.229
But you know what?
I've been dedicated

18:19.229 --> 18:22.169
to this team very long, okay?
This is my kids' week.

18:26.043 --> 18:27.680
MELISSA:
I didn't mean

18:27.680 --> 18:29.818
to offend you,
and that's not why I said it.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.289
It was just... it was just...
a really long road.

18:32.289 --> 18:33.625
We've been here since day one.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.097
And everybody comes on the team
because they know

18:36.097 --> 18:37.700
they're gonna ride
the <i>Dance Mom</i> train.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.004
RODRIGUEZ: Now, look,
Melissa, you have

18:40.004 --> 18:42.008
very strong feelings
about the mini moms.

18:42.008 --> 18:43.512
Wh‐Why?
Because they think

18:43.512 --> 18:47.385
that they're, like,
the new generation of Abby.
We are!

18:47.385 --> 18:49.223
We're her new legacy.
Well, we are.
We are.

18:49.223 --> 18:51.060
We are.
New blood.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.597
New blood.
HOLLY:
You cannot go there.

18:52.597 --> 18:55.101
You will never have
that history or legacy.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.405
So take that off the table.
Kerri,

18:57.405 --> 18:59.511
what's your expectation?

18:59.511 --> 19:01.180
Abby's been here now.
We... The first half

19:01.180 --> 19:03.251
of the season,
we didn't see her. And now

19:03.251 --> 19:05.054
we're seeing her.
Our girls are

19:05.054 --> 19:06.958
working with her, and they're
winning. I just want that

19:06.958 --> 19:09.764
to continue and Abby
to quit worrying about me

19:09.764 --> 19:13.037
going into a hole and dying
and just teach my child.
I'm not worried

19:13.037 --> 19:16.076
about it.
It's just wishful thinking.

19:16.076 --> 19:17.479
(audience chuckles nervously)

19:17.479 --> 19:19.249
This really is the Abby
I love, though.

19:19.249 --> 19:20.653
(laughing)
I mean...

19:20.653 --> 19:23.191
Abby, you've been going back
and forth all season.

19:23.191 --> 19:25.796
Are you ready now
to commit to the minis?

19:25.796 --> 19:27.165
No!

19:27.165 --> 19:29.236
To put them in an environment

19:29.236 --> 19:31.340
where they have to learn
a number and compete it

19:31.340 --> 19:34.079
in two days?!
They're not ready for that!

19:34.079 --> 19:35.549
They're doing it,
and they're winning.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.385
Yeah, I‐I choreographed
the number.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.722
I‐I know what you did.

19:38.722 --> 19:40.058
RODRIGUEZ:
Well, there you have it.

19:40.058 --> 19:42.329
When we come back,
we'll dive into the real reason

19:42.329 --> 19:44.199
Abby flipped out
this season.

19:44.199 --> 19:46.738
But before we go to break, let's
check out Maddie and Kendall

19:46.738 --> 19:48.575

<i>Coming up...</i>
ABBY LEE: <i>I did not leave</i>
Abby, you had one of
the most difficult

21:57.365 --> 21:58.969
years of your life.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.406
You started a new business,
some legal issues.

22:01.406 --> 22:04.112
What is your biggest concern
right now?

22:04.112 --> 22:08.087
That they told you to say that,
and you actually did.

22:08.087 --> 22:10.491
Well, no. I mean, like, you
have the dance studio here,

22:10.491 --> 22:12.563
you have it there,
you're talking about

22:12.563 --> 22:15.368
the shape of things and what
the future is holding for you.

22:15.368 --> 22:19.911
I'm still working,
trying to put the fires out.

22:19.911 --> 22:21.146
RODRIGUEZ:
Has Abby opened up

22:21.146 --> 22:22.315
to any of you,

22:22.315 --> 22:23.718
or let you know
how she's feeling?

22:23.718 --> 22:25.354
Anybody?
Looking at the wrong person.

22:25.354 --> 22:27.292
Got it.
Okay, so...
doesn't open up to me.

22:27.292 --> 22:29.229
Well, Abby doesn't
necessarily open up to me, but

22:29.229 --> 22:30.933
it's obvious
Abby has a lot

22:30.933 --> 22:33.505
going on. Like,
we see her every single day.

22:33.505 --> 22:35.943
There's highs, there's lows,
there's

22:35.943 --> 22:37.680
a new...
Clothes, bras, maybe not.

22:37.680 --> 22:38.982
Towels.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.151
JILL: Curlers, towels.
RODRIGUEZ:
Sequins.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.286
Tummies.
JILL:
You name it.

22:41.286 --> 22:43.357
I'm just not a big
"get ready" person.

22:43.357 --> 22:44.927
(laughter)

22:44.927 --> 22:46.396
We have had, I will say,

22:46.396 --> 22:49.670
this season,
more than most, we are left

22:49.670 --> 22:52.008
in a conundrum whether
Abby will show up or not.

22:52.008 --> 22:54.513
And what time of day
she will show up.

22:54.513 --> 22:57.118
If we can drag her
out of her bedroom.

22:57.118 --> 22:58.420
Or bathroom.
Or bathroom.
Or bathroom.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.391
And how she's gonna
look when she comes out.

23:00.391 --> 23:01.594
And who's the lucky mom

23:01.594 --> 23:03.732
that gets to go back there
to check on Abby?

23:03.732 --> 23:05.869
Usually, we send her.
It's been me a lot.

23:05.869 --> 23:07.606
Is that not like a message
that I'm really not interested

23:07.606 --> 23:08.775
in you
and don't come around me?

23:08.775 --> 23:09.977
HOLLY:
That's our point.

23:09.977 --> 23:11.313
That's‐that's our point.
Well, that's our point,

23:11.313 --> 23:13.117
that you're overwhelmed.
You have a lot...

23:13.117 --> 23:15.722
I'm not overwhelmed.
I'm just over <i>it,</i> that's it.
JILL: Sometimes

23:15.722 --> 23:17.693
your battles aren't ours,
like...
Right.

23:17.693 --> 23:20.699
And I'm asking you as a friend
to fight my battle with me.

23:20.699 --> 23:21.934
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.237
RODRIGUEZ:
Abby, you went missing

23:23.237 --> 23:25.408
for two competitions.
What happened there?

23:25.408 --> 23:26.644
I don't know where I was.

23:26.644 --> 23:28.080
I think that was the week

23:28.080 --> 23:30.284
that you found out
that Chloe, the little girl

23:30.284 --> 23:32.923
that left the team
when we came, booked a movie.

23:32.923 --> 23:35.996
Bingo!

23:35.996 --> 23:39.235
You're choice, but I was told
I could talk about her, so...

23:39.235 --> 23:41.073
I'm not saying anything.
RODRIGUEZ: Oh.

23:41.073 --> 23:43.945
I think that was
what set you over the edge.
JILL: I didn't realize...

23:43.945 --> 23:45.615
No. I don't think
you cared about that.
...that was when.

23:45.615 --> 23:47.018
I don't know.

23:47.018 --> 23:48.487
RODRIGUEZ:
Holly, you're looking
kind of quiet.

23:48.487 --> 23:50.224
I'm bewildered. All I know is
Abby didn't show up for work.

23:50.224 --> 23:51.928
And that's what...
that's been my thing all season.

23:51.928 --> 23:53.097

It's called strike.

Dances some, sits a lot.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.973

Well, Holly, you took

23:57.973 --> 23:59.075
matters into your own hands.

23:59.075 --> 24:00.979
Tell us a little
bit about that.

24:00.979 --> 24:03.016
Well, I think it came
on the heels of,

24:03.016 --> 24:05.054
once again, going to Abby,
talking to her about,

24:05.054 --> 24:06.858
do you want us here or not here?

24:06.858 --> 24:09.028
And Abby actually told us
she didn't want us here.

24:09.028 --> 24:10.398
And I said,
"Do you really mean that?"

24:10.398 --> 24:12.335
And I said "yes," because...

24:12.335 --> 24:13.671
I‐I don't care
about your legal issues

24:13.671 --> 24:15.441
and wanting to talk about them.

24:15.441 --> 24:17.780
Oh, I did not leave the kids
high and dry.
RODRIGUEZ: All right, well,

let's roll the clip,
let's take a look.

you've worked together as
a group, and I guess it's about

24:59.496 --> 25:02.068
deciding what is the narrative.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.038
This is why
dancers make the best actors.

25:04.038 --> 25:06.176

for work, and she has

you ended up going.

28:29.962 --> 28:31.799
so she was able

28:31.799 --> 28:33.302
to continue with the team

28:33.302 --> 28:34.672
and she didn't have to be

28:34.672 --> 28:36.341
"replaced".
But, Kira, you know,
some of the moms

28:36.341 --> 28:37.343
weren't so happy about that.

28:37.343 --> 28:39.381
So let's take a look.

28:39.381 --> 28:41.018
Your child couldn't have
been here without Melissa.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.453
No, and I didn't use her.
You know that.

28:42.453 --> 28:43.757
She had your child for

28:43.757 --> 28:46.829
three months.
Yeah, she was a wreck.

28:46.829 --> 28:49.100
KIRA: <i>I don't think Melissa</i>
<i>would not tell me</i>

28:49.100 --> 28:52.006
if she was that stressed out
having my kid.

28:52.006 --> 28:54.444
<i>These moms are clearly</i>
<i>trying to stir up trouble.</i>

28:54.444 --> 28:58.452
She was trying to be nice to you
and do the right thing

28:58.452 --> 29:01.458
where you're home,
doing whatever the hell you want

29:01.458 --> 29:04.297
and someone else is watching
your kid for 12 weeks.

29:04.297 --> 29:05.734
Do you know
how many times I said,

29:05.734 --> 29:07.437
"Just tell her, just tell her"?

29:07.437 --> 29:10.376
And she said, "No, I don't want
Kalani to feel bad. I don't..."

29:10.376 --> 29:11.746
To me, that's a horrible person.

29:11.746 --> 29:13.850
She just watched your kid
for 12 weeks

29:13.850 --> 29:16.054
and you called her
a horrible person.
No...

29:16.054 --> 29:18.058
That's exactly why Melissa
did not bring it up.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.729
You're, like,
super arrogant about it.

29:19.729 --> 29:20.931
JILL:
I know‐‐ you don't care.
No, what I'm...

29:20.931 --> 29:22.166
You don't give a (bleep).
arrogant about

29:22.166 --> 29:23.636
is the fact that
you're sitting here

29:23.636 --> 29:26.074
trying to blame my child

29:26.074 --> 29:27.945
for putting Melissa
in a hospital.
No, no, no, no,

29:27.945 --> 29:29.682
no, no, no, no, no.
KIRA: That's tacky.

29:29.682 --> 29:31.786
That's tacky.
JESSALYNN: You would
think that, Kira,

29:31.786 --> 29:33.490
because you're tacky.
And you're really not

29:33.490 --> 29:35.393
the most brightest person
in the room, but you

29:35.393 --> 29:37.397
would think that.
I need a drink.

29:37.397 --> 29:39.334
KIRA: Walk your happy ass
that way and get your (bleep)

29:39.334 --> 29:41.038
facts straight.
Thank you.

29:41.038 --> 29:42.340
Wow.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.979
You're trying to make (bleep) up
to cause drama.

29:44.979 --> 29:46.783
So walk your (bleep) that way.

29:46.783 --> 29:48.787
Oh.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.156
I'm sick of her!

29:53.462 --> 29:55.399
Whoa. That was rough.

29:55.399 --> 29:57.437
Uh, it's the craziest (bleep)
I've ever seen.

29:57.437 --> 30:01.078
Kira, why did things
get so heated?
'Cause she knows we're right.

30:01.078 --> 30:03.449
She took a little bit
of advantage.
The whole reason

30:03.449 --> 30:05.319
I said that about Melissa
was because

30:05.319 --> 30:07.390
I talked to Melissa
almost every...

30:07.390 --> 30:08.425
single night.
Every day.

30:08.425 --> 30:10.162
We were in direct
communication

30:10.162 --> 30:11.899
two to three times a day.

30:11.899 --> 30:13.603
Mm‐hmm.
So, if Melissa

30:13.603 --> 30:16.374
was having a hard time
with my 15‐year‐old,

30:16.374 --> 30:18.045
who pretty much
takes care of herself...

30:18.045 --> 30:19.515
No, she did... wasn't
having a hard time.
I was just stressed.

30:19.515 --> 30:21.284
When her back was hurting,
I was stressed.

30:21.284 --> 30:23.255
So, you just said
you were stressed.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.059
I was stressed when
Kalani hurt her back.

30:25.059 --> 30:27.798
And I was, like, I mean, I
literally didn't sleep at night,

30:27.798 --> 30:29.969
I kept going in and making sure
she was sleeping,

30:29.969 --> 30:32.273
'cause I was worried,
I mean, I‐I was worried.

30:32.273 --> 30:33.877
I was like,
"That's a horrible person."

30:33.877 --> 30:35.847
If you're telling me you're
fine, everything's fine...

30:35.847 --> 30:37.918
Never. She's no trouble.
And then

30:37.918 --> 30:38.920
everybody else is telling me

30:38.920 --> 30:40.891
that all this stuff.
When she...

30:40.891 --> 30:42.393
Kalani's not the problem.

30:42.393 --> 30:44.130
The problem is
you pawned your kid off

30:44.130 --> 30:46.201
on Melissa for 12 weeks.
No, the problem
is you thinking

30:46.201 --> 30:47.938
you need to be a part of...
JESSALYNN: God!

30:47.938 --> 30:49.440
mine and Melissa's business.
I thought she broke her back.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.478
We're trying to help her,
which is what we tried to do.

30:51.478 --> 30:53.583
You just pawn your kid off...
Melissa doesn't need your help.
Melissa's just fine.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.219
...on anyone
that'll take her.
I know.

30:55.219 --> 30:57.491
I'm sorry that I had a baby.

30:57.491 --> 30:59.995
Oh, Kira, this is
not the first time

30:59.995 --> 31:01.164
you've pawned Kalani off.

31:01.164 --> 31:02.868
Kira does have a history
of pawning Kalani off.

31:02.868 --> 31:04.370
I didn't pawn my child off.

31:04.370 --> 31:05.472
I had a baby.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.243
Then bring her
home with you.

31:07.243 --> 31:09.314
Ashlee! She's part of this team!

31:09.314 --> 31:11.084

was part of this team.

that you want to be home

31:15.392 --> 31:17.363

a part of that and joi...
