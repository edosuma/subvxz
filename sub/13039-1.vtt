OF RYDER, STOKER, CROSS,

01:15:56.902 --> 01:15:59.942
THE 3 MAIN PLAYERS
WHO GIVE UP
THE RUMSEN RACK.

01:16:00.005 --> 01:16:04.075
NOW, EACH MICROCHIP
IS INFUSED WITH
TRILLIONS OF
GRAVITON HALVES,

01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:06.112
LIKE THE SUPER BALLS
I SHOWED YOU.

01:16:06.178 --> 01:16:08.848
CORRESPONDING
MICROCHIPS WITH OTHER
GRAVITON HALVES

01:16:08.914 --> 01:16:10.884
WILL BE IN OUR SKATES.

01:16:10.949 --> 01:16:14.989
WHATEVER OUR SKATES DO,
THEIR SKATES WILL BE
FORCED TO DO.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.415
MONKEY SEE,
MONKEY DO!

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.020
EXACTLY.

01:16:20.092 --> 01:16:21.392
ISN'T THAT...CHEATING?

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.360
WE ONLY NEED TO KEEP
RUMSEN FROM CHEATING.

01:16:23.428 --> 01:16:25.358
OUR GUYS
CAN DO THE REST.

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:28.130
NOW, WHEN THE TIME
COMES, DEION WILL
FLIP THE SWITCH,

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.300
ACTIVATING
THE PARTICLES,
AND WE'RE ON.

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:36.772
AND I HELPED YOU
GET A "C" IN SCIENCE.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.627
YOU SURE DID
A NUMBER
ON THIS LAB.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.626
WON'T THAT
PROFESSOR GUY
CARE?

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:02.568
NAH. I'LL HAVE IT
BACK TO NORMAL
AFTER THE GAME.

01:17:02.634 --> 01:17:05.574
BESIDES, I'VE ARRANGED
HIS SCHEDULE SO THAT
HE'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.

01:17:05.637 --> 01:17:07.567
AND HE'S NEVER HERE
DURING HOCKEY GAMES.

01:17:07.639 --> 01:17:09.069
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

01:17:09.141 --> 01:17:10.581
OK. ALMOST NEVER.

01:17:10.642 --> 01:17:12.582
CHARLIE...THIS HAS GONE
WAY TOO FAR!

01:17:12.644 --> 01:17:15.584
I LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
WHEN YOU ALMOST DESTROYED
THE ACCELERATOR,

01:17:15.647 --> 01:17:17.007
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

01:17:17.082 --> 01:17:19.122
I TOLD YOU
I HAD TO DO WHAT
I HAD TO DO.

01:17:19.184 --> 01:17:21.594
NO. THIS HAS GOTTA STOP,
AND IT'S GOTTA STOP
RIGHT NOW.

01:17:21.653 --> 01:17:23.593
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON MY SIDE!

01:17:23.655 --> 01:17:25.585
YOU KNOW
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

01:17:25.657 --> 01:17:27.927
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE
IN JEOPARDY.

01:17:27.993 --> 01:17:30.093
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT SCIENCE FIRST.

01:17:30.162 --> 01:17:32.932
AHEAD OF WHAT?
YOU CAN SOLVE ALL THE
MYSTERIES IN THE WORLD,

01:17:32.998 --> 01:17:36.198
BUT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN
WITHOUT FRIENDS?
NOTHING.

01:17:36.268 --> 01:17:39.598
THE CHANCE TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE SELFISH
THINGS I DID...

01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:41.611
TO HELP MY FRIENDS...

01:17:41.673 --> 01:17:44.613
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

01:17:44.676 --> 01:17:47.136
SO PLEASE...HELP ME.

01:17:47.212 --> 01:17:50.622
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.
I CAN'T BE A PARTY
TO THIS.

01:17:51.683 --> 01:17:52.823
BUT WAIT!

01:17:52.884 --> 01:17:55.354
CHAZ! I MEAN CHARLIE.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.690
WE GOT SOME ACTION
HERE.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.816
ODIE, TIGHT UP.

01:18:10.135 --> 01:18:11.565
THEY'RE GOING AFTER MIKE!

01:18:11.637 --> 01:18:13.197
OMAR, YOU'RE IN!

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:15.111
MIKE, GET OFF!

01:18:16.141 --> 01:18:17.071
OK, GUYS,
GET READY.

01:18:17.142 --> 01:18:18.542
WE GOTTA STOP
THE RUMSEN RACK.

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.809
DEION, FLIP THE SWITCH.

01:18:27.886 --> 01:18:28.816
TAKE...

01:18:28.887 --> 01:18:30.117
THAT!

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.602
PENALTY BOX!

01:18:39.831 --> 01:18:40.831
YEAH!

01:18:42.934 --> 01:18:44.704

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:47.000
STOP NUMBER 2!

01:18:47.072 --> 01:18:48.612

01:18:50.509 --> 01:18:52.639
DEION, GIVE ME
THE OTHER CHIP!

01:18:57.683 --> 01:18:58.623
HERE.

01:18:58.684 --> 01:19:00.084
I'M STOKER.
YOU'RE RYDER.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.752
LET'S ROCK.

01:19:18.136 --> 01:19:19.766
LET'S GO!

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.750
Fans: WHOA!

01:19:51.737 --> 01:19:53.337
DANCE WITH ME.

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:14.964
LET GO OF ME!
NO, YOU LET GO OF ME!

01:20:35.714 --> 01:20:36.984
CROSS IS LEAVING
THE BOX.

01:20:37.048 --> 01:20:38.778
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL!

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.150
DO SOMETHING!

01:20:40.218 --> 01:20:42.148
HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT
FOR MIKE!

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.590
QUICK,

01:20:43.655 --> 01:20:45.485
DEION, WHERE'S THE CHIP?
SHAKE IT, ROLL IT,
ANYTHING!

01:20:45.557 --> 01:20:46.557
I CAN'T FIND IT!

01:20:50.462 --> 01:20:51.402
MIKE!

01:20:51.463 --> 01:20:52.463
AAH!

01:20:56.468 --> 01:20:57.568
WHAT ARE YOU

01:20:57.636 --> 01:20:58.766
I HAVE THE OTHER CHIP!

01:20:59.805 --> 01:21:01.235
AAH! ARE THERE

01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:31.901
WE DEFIED GRAVITY!

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.469
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

01:21:56.728 --> 01:21:59.358

01:21:59.431 --> 01:22:00.661
YEAH!

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.030
IT'S

01:22:04.102 --> 01:22:05.902
WE MUST HAVE
REVERSED THE CHARGE
OF THE GRAVITONS!

01:22:05.971 --> 01:22:08.371
THEY'RE REPELLING
AGAINST THE POSITIVE
CHARGE OF THE EARTH!

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:12.480
Game announcer:
THE FINAL SCORE--
NORTHERN 1, RUMSEN NOTHING!

01:22:13.778 --> 01:22:17.148
COACH, YOU ARE GONNA
BE HERE A LONG TIME,
MY FRIEND.

01:22:17.215 --> 01:22:18.875
A LONG, LONG TIME.

01:22:23.388 --> 01:22:25.318
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I CALL
PUBLICITY.

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:28.190
OH, YEAH! HA HA HA!

01:22:32.564 --> 01:22:34.404
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:46.643
OK, I'LL TAKE RUDIS.

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:49.351
I'LL TAKE SMITHSON.

01:22:49.414 --> 01:22:51.154
THEN I'LL TAKE VAN BONN.

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:56.693
MAN, YOU'RE STICKING

01:22:56.755 --> 01:22:58.155
COME ON, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:22:58.223 --> 01:22:59.493

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:08.966
HEY, BOYLE!

01:23:11.002 --> 01:23:12.442

01:23:12.504 --> 01:23:15.944
HEY, LISTEN, IF YOU
WANT US TO GET OFF THE ICE...

01:23:16.007 --> 01:23:18.607
WELL, WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT SLAPPING THE PUCK

01:23:18.677 --> 01:23:22.277
OK. WE'LL JUST CLEAR OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.

01:23:22.347 --> 01:23:24.617
WE NEED SOMEBODY

01:23:24.683 --> 01:23:26.423
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

01:23:36.928 --> 01:23:37.858

01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:39.329

HOW DID HE?

01:23:43.702 --> 01:23:45.142
SO...

01:23:45.203 --> 01:23:48.143
MAYBE I TALK

01:23:48.206 --> 01:23:50.976
OK, BUT ON ONE
CONDITION.

01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:52.242
NAME IT.

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:53.780
