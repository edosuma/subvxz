WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.760
BARUCH: There is a great war coming.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.560
All conscious beings are
engaged in a battle already.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.840
ASRIEL:  And I would risk
everything, and every one,

00:10.840 --> 00:13.920
to destroy Metatron. SCREAMING

00:13.920 --> 00:16.160
Asriel, she's our daughter,
and she's in danger.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.040
Do you know who they say she is?

00:18.040 --> 00:20.400
All that matters is the child.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.680
My child.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.280
I need to go to the land of
the dead and put things right.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.200
I can't betray Roger.
PAN:  Just go.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.960
MACPHAIL:  We will use the
lock of your daughter's hair

00:28.960 --> 00:31.560
to locate her and to destroy her.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.120
Roger! We need to get out of here.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.440
This isn't life after death,
this is a prison camp.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.000
None of you should be here.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.920
JOPARI:  As soon as you release
these ghosts,

00:39.920 --> 00:41.360
you must find your daemon, Will.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.400
I guided her to Asriel's republic.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.160
ALARBUS:  The mortal Lord Asriel
is harnessing technology

00:47.160 --> 00:48.600
to challenge you.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.960
METATRON: It's time to send
these mortals a warning.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.040
I stopped the bomb from detonating,

00:54.040 --> 00:56.720
but angelic light struck
the intercision chamber

00:56.720 --> 00:58.240
and triggered the release.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.400
Metatron's answer to your war cry.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.560
IOREK:  Lyra went
to the land of the dead,

01:07.560 --> 01:09.400
but she walked in alive.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.480
The witches' prophecy.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.520
She is Eve,
and she will defeat death.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.360
Tell them stories!

01:15.360 --> 01:16.960
ASRIEL:  She's extraordinary.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.120
To free a soul
from the land of the dead...

01:20.120 --> 01:23.000
Metatron's purgatory is broken.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.760
He will come at you
with everything he has.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.320
SQUAWKING

01:43.800 --> 01:46.000
ALARM BLARES

01:48.240 --> 01:49.640
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:49.640 --> 01:51.640
Come on, let's go.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.000
HURRIED VOICES, SHOUTING

01:54.000 --> 01:55.440
SPARKS CRACKLE

01:55.440 --> 01:57.440
Go! That's right, come on.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.200
SPARKS CRACKLE

02:05.960 --> 02:08.080
ENGINEER:  Sir,
the capacitors are ready.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.520
Good. Have those transported
to the abyss.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.800
ALARM CONTINUES

02:25.800 --> 02:29.280
INDISTINCT INSTRUCTIONS

02:34.600 --> 02:35.840
Look out.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.320
XAPHANIA:  The Clouded Mountain
draws closer.

02:44.320 --> 02:48.280
The way forward now depends on Lyra.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.880
If Eve survives the Fall once more,

02:50.880 --> 02:53.280
all worlds will be liberated.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.320
But if Metatron can control
the children,

02:56.320 --> 03:01.200
or their daemons,
the future is his - forever.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.600
I have devoted my entire life
to science

03:04.600 --> 03:06.600
and the pursuit of truth.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.480
I have sworn blind that prophecies

03:08.480 --> 03:12.160
are merely stories concocted
to control the credulous.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.760
And yet, here I stand,

03:14.760 --> 03:19.120
unable to avoid the prophetic
truth in front of me.

03:19.120 --> 03:23.280
The success of our entire rebellion

03:23.280 --> 03:25.680
seemingly hinges upon the survival

03:25.680 --> 03:27.760
of our daughter.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.400
So, change of plan.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.520
We don't have to win this fight.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.720
We just have to keep
Metatron's forces away

03:33.720 --> 03:35.400
from the girl and the boy
long enough

03:35.400 --> 03:37.840
for them to be reunited
with their daemons.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.120
Escape to a safe world and Fall.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.840
I will alert you when the
knife-bearer cuts through.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.720
Spirit can sense the blade.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.680
All civilians have taken shelter in
the bunker beneath the base.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.160
Our human forces can be
stationed around the perimeter.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.720
Kaisa has been searching
for the daemons.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.080
When he finds them,
I will go to them.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.560
Good. You'll bring them back here?

03:59.560 --> 04:02.400
Here? With the Clouded Mountain
above us?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.720
I designed this building
to withstand angelic force.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.160
How can you possibly know the nature
of Metatron's attack? I...

04:08.160 --> 04:10.680
Oh, I am prepared for him.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.680
SNARLING

05:07.120 --> 05:09.280
RUSTLING

05:46.280 --> 05:48.000
We could go through to that world.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.360
It's sunny. It smells nice.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.800
We can't.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.880
You know, I have an idea.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.280
We need to get to our daemons,
right?

06:04.120 --> 06:06.520
So if I cut to the Republic,
find them...

06:07.560 --> 06:09.920
..you can go to that nice world
and I'll meet you there.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.280
You want to leave me?

06:14.280 --> 06:17.240
Not leave you,
just let you go there.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.920
You just said
you wanted to do that.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.400
We've come this far,
and you still don't understand.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.360
We're in this together.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.760
Quite clear you're unconvinced
by the plan.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.040
Here.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.840
I've placed capacitors inside the
abyss to harness the Dust flow.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.240
It's a simple switch mechanism,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.280
but when the detonator is released,

06:49.280 --> 06:52.480
the energy coils collide
to create an energy surge.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.240
It may be powerful enough

06:55.240 --> 06:57.760
to destabilise
the entire Clouded Mountain.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.400
I'm going to go there.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.640
I'm going to make sure
that when his house comes down,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.240
Metatron goes into that abyss.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.320
And how exactly do you intend
on doing that, Asriel?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.440
Sheer physical force.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.560
They're envious of us up there,
Marisa.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.960
The angels.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.680
Our flesh, our blood,

07:23.680 --> 07:25.560
our short, vital lives.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.000
They've none of it.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.720
I have to believe that flesh
is stronger than spirit.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.840
I don't think
you can be certain of that.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.440
Do you know the only thing
I've ever been certain of?

07:36.440 --> 07:38.640
That I was born
to change the worlds.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.600
And now it seems that that destiny
belongs to someone else.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.440
I've given the girl nothing.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.360
But at the very least,
I can buy her time.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.880
You'd do that?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.200
For her?

08:05.600 --> 08:06.880
Not just her.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.640
If I succeed in bringing him
to the abyss,

08:17.640 --> 08:19.640
will you detonate the device?

08:26.080 --> 08:30.080
Even if you get him to the abyss,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.120
you do understand -
it's not just death down there.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.680
It's eternal oblivion.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.200
Mm-hm.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.640
Ask me whatever you wish.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.440
We're doomed, aren't we?

08:56.520 --> 08:59.320
For all Asriel's planning,
we've no idea

08:59.320 --> 09:00.640
what we're about to face.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.200
Come on!

09:07.200 --> 09:11.040
You see so much,
and yet you share so little.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.040
CORK POPS
DRINK POURS

09:19.040 --> 09:20.480
BOTTLE THUDS ON SHELF

09:33.240 --> 09:34.520
Please.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.880
Tell me how this ends.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.320
You don't need me to.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.640
You've already made up your mind.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.880
Is my mind that easy to read?

09:48.960 --> 09:52.800
Your love for Lyra
is your salvation and your downfall.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
When you think of her,
I can read you

09:56.080 --> 09:58.600
as easily as a reflection
in still water.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.840
You have an extraordinary power

10:01.840 --> 10:05.680
to suppress the best of yourself.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.120
When the time comes, use it.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.000
Metatron is a seer.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.800
A mortal who has not confronted
their own darkness

10:17.800 --> 10:20.600
is as helpless as a child
before him.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.720
Well, then,
Asriel is no match for him.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.720
SHE CHUCKLES IRONICALLY

10:27.720 --> 10:29.520
Right, so we are doomed.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.240
ASRIEL OVER TANNOY:  Some of
us will die today.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.720
The Authority wants you
to be afraid of that.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.240
And why not?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.480
We are all of us here mortal.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.400
Whether our lifespans
are three or 300 years,

11:01.400 --> 11:05.000
our time down here
in the Earth is finite.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.600
And so we cower.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.640
We cower under the tyranny
of an authority

11:09.640 --> 11:13.120
who calls himself Creator...

11:14.800 --> 11:17.520
..who tells us that hell awaits

11:17.520 --> 11:20.160
those who disobey him.

11:20.160 --> 11:25.840
And that paradise exists
only for those who obey.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.080
This is a lie.

11:28.400 --> 11:33.000
A lie that has prevented us from
living our lives to the utmost.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.600
Today is our chance.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.680
It is our chance to tell him

11:38.680 --> 11:42.680
that our lives are beautiful
and precious,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.160
and that we should be
allowed to experience

11:45.160 --> 11:48.520
all they have to offer without the
fear of retribution.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.880
Because if we don't fight
until the end,

11:50.880 --> 11:53.960
we will lose everything.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.280
So, yes, today,
some of you will die.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.120
But thanks to my daughter...

12:05.480 --> 12:07.200
..thanks to Lyra...

12:09.240 --> 12:11.280
..we need no longer fear that fate.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.080
For from today,
death is no longer an ending,

12:17.080 --> 12:19.960
but instead a journey
back into life.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.920
So from today, the Authority
has no power over us.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.080
Today, life confronts death,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.840
and our light shines
through the darkness.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.720
Today, we will tell him

12:34.720 --> 12:37.160
that our children shall
experience paradise,

12:37.160 --> 12:40.040
but they will know it down here,
in the earth.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.160
Today, we are free!

12:46.480 --> 12:50.640
CHANTING:  We are free! We are free!

12:50.640 --> 12:54.160
We are free! We are free!

12:55.320 --> 12:56.840
We are free!

13:03.520 --> 13:05.400
THUNDER BOOMS

13:07.400 --> 13:10.000
The Kingdom of Heaven is nigh.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.960
Let's bring it down, shall we?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.600
INTENTION CRAFT HUMS

13:59.760 --> 14:02.320
I'm glad I said we didn't
have to win this fight.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.120
So there are advantages
to not being the chosen one.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.280
Sure you're ready?

14:18.280 --> 14:20.480
Yeah.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.560
Can't be worse than
the land of the dead, can it?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.000

15:25.120 --> 15:28.520
To the south, where the mountains
rise from the plateau.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.080
Attack!

15:30.080 --> 15:32.360
SHOUTING: Now!

15:40.400 --> 15:42.560
Commander, come in.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.720
It's time. Go to the southern
perimeter.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.200

At least we're in
the same world as them.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.600
Pan and your daemon will be
together, looking after each other.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.440
Let's keep moving.

For Lyra?

16:38.720 --> 16:41.640
Metatron is releasing
the daemon-eaters.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.760
He is turning all creatures
against us.

Who are you?

21:29.480 --> 21:33.560
I'm Commander Ogunwe,
and I'm here to protect you.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.040
I'll take you to Asriel's camp.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.400
So I can cut us there.  No!

21:38.400 --> 21:40.440
Do not use that blade.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.840
He'll do what he wants.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.000
You see those angels up there?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.880
Now that you're in this world,

21:46.880 --> 21:49.720
they can sense
when you use the blade.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.400
They'll know you're separated

21:51.400 --> 21:54.120
from your daemons,
and they will target them.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.960

22:04.240 --> 22:05.520
You can trust me.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.080
Quickly.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.280
Pantalaimon.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.720
You've been through so much pain.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.760
But you must be reunited with Lyra.

You're in grave danger.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.400
But they've come back for you.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.480
We have to hurry. Will you trust me?

23:11.800 --> 23:13.960

23:36.200 --> 23:38.640
Do you trust him?

23:38.640 --> 23:40.680
You shouldn't.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.880
He uses people.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.480
All I know is
Asriel's proud of you.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.800
No, he isn't.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.280
I personally heard him
champion your name

23:48.280 --> 23:50.320
in front of hundreds
of his own troops.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.880
I don't know why he'd do that.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.760

You are...

..unusual.

METATRON: You wish to serve
no-one but yourself.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.720
You are a cesspit of moral filth.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.800
Do not lie to me.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.840
We only seek what we're denied.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.240
Who were you before you had power?

31:35.680 --> 31:37.240
Did you not crave it, too?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.880
I was...

31:43.320 --> 31:45.720
..a man.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.960
Ruthless...

31:48.120 --> 31:49.360
..but fallible.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.880
Not unlike yourself.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.720
They say spirit envies flesh.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.560
Why would I envy weakness?

32:01.240 --> 32:03.560
Flesh is vulnerable.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.600
Its power is...

32:07.040 --> 32:08.720
..crude.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.360
Flesh has its pleasures.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.080
You do this very well, don't you?

32:14.080 --> 32:17.160
No wonder the mortal men
are convinced.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.120
Why did you call to me?

32:19.120 --> 32:23.280
Lie to me again, and I will
extinguish your life like a flame.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.080
I was curious.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.160
I wanted to meet you.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.840
I'm here!

32:37.800 --> 32:41.000
The arrogance of man.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.760
Do you think
you can fight nature itself?

32:43.760 --> 32:46.360
Why don't you come down here
and prove me wrong?

32:49.440 --> 32:51.400
The unequalled Lord Asriel...

32:52.640 --> 32:54.800
..who wages war on the heavens

32:54.800 --> 32:57.800
but dares not confront his own self.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.160
Look at you.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.640
All alone.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.720
What is it that scares you so much?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.080
I see!

33:10.120 --> 33:12.520
It's resentment
of your own daughter.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.200
Maybe.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.960
But I'm not afraid of you.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.800
That is a lie.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.040
Face yourself.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.880
You're here because I chose you.

33:37.880 --> 33:42.440
If I wished, you could transcend
your human form.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.960
Never again diminish yourself,

33:44.960 --> 33:47.000
or be shamed for your strength.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.720
The multiverse
would be yours to command.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.800
What are you offering me?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.080
Immortality.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.840
In the past,

33:57.840 --> 34:01.640
a chosen few have become angels.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.520
It's not happened for millennia.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.520
Not since the Fall of man.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.320
You thought of Eve. Interesting.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.360
You're attempting to conceal
something from me.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.000
I see...an attachment.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.560
A weakness.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.160
Regret.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.800
Shame.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.040
Love.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.880
Your daughter, Lyra.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.960
MRS COULTER:  Yes.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.080
Yes. I do love Lyra.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.800
I love her...

34:52.320 --> 34:54.640
..and I hate that I do.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.760
Do you have no words of supplication

34:56.760 --> 34:58.880
for your Creator before your death?

34:58.880 --> 35:00.520
You're not the Creator.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.320
You're not even the Authority.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.480
You're just hiding behind him like
you're hiding behind me now!

35:06.480 --> 35:08.400
I am in all things.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.640
What I am is far beyond
your comprehension.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.560
No, it's not. You're an angel.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.360
And before that,
you were a man named Enoch.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.480
Either way, you're just a person.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.360
You thought you were going
to liberate the worlds.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.960
But the sooner you accept
your own failure,

35:54.960 --> 35:57.600
the sooner this can all be over.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.600
Your land of the dead is no more.
HE CHUCKLES

36:00.600 --> 36:05.800
You put me in the grave
and you just set my soul free.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.360
You're going to have to do
more than kill me.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.880
Oh, when I do...

36:13.360 --> 36:15.240
..no-one will ever remember you.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.520
I think we're getting closer.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.400
I can feel Pan.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.000
She makes me feel...

36:25.320 --> 36:26.800
..weak.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.640
It's not who I am.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.920
When she looks at me,
all I see is disdain.

36:38.720 --> 36:42.840
I become needy and helpless.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.760
I want that feeling gone.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.160
Relinquish it.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.480
How?  Let her go.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.400
You are completely alone.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.560
No-one cares for you.  Marisa does.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.560
She's...

37:02.560 --> 37:05.480
She's here, isn't she?

37:05.480 --> 37:06.840
Free yourself.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.040
How do I do that? She...

37:09.040 --> 37:10.720
She's part of me.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.040
Marisa!

37:13.440 --> 37:14.800
Marisa!

37:14.800 --> 37:16.040
HE GROANS

37:16.040 --> 37:18.560
I see inside your heart, Marisa,

37:18.560 --> 37:21.240
you are capable of such betrayal.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.080
FAINTLY:  Marisa? Marisa?!

37:27.280 --> 37:29.040
Marisa!

37:30.800 --> 37:32.040
Yes.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.080
I am.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.720
I am.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.200
You care for her still.

37:42.200 --> 37:46.440
If only you knew the disdain
in which she holds you.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.480
She is giving you up.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.920
No, never.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.520
Never.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.120
I love her.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.760
I can give you Lyra.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.200
She would never betray me.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.640
I can give you Asriel.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.280
He's trying to protect her.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.240
I do not need you to give him to me.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.760
I've already broken him.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.520
SHE LAUGHS SOFTLY

38:16.520 --> 38:18.160
SHE EXHALES

38:18.160 --> 38:19.520
Show me.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.200
ASRIEL COUGHS

38:37.000 --> 38:38.440
Look at him.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.120
WHEEZING AND COUGHING

38:42.120 --> 38:43.960
He knows he's beaten.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.160
His end has come.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.000
Wait.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.560
I want him to see my face.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.600
I want him to see what I've done.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.200
Mar...

39:08.200 --> 39:10.320
Marisa, no...

39:17.560 --> 39:20.160
Stay here and hide.
It won't be long now.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.120
I'll send Lyra and Will to you.

You are full of sin.

WOMAN PLEADS

39:32.800 --> 39:34.160
The Authority will punish you!

You're going to pray!

39:35.880 --> 39:37.200
Heretics!

39:37.200 --> 39:39.040
SOLDIER 2:  Down on your knees,
all of you!

39:39.040 --> 39:41.000
SOLDIER 1:  Pray to the Authority!

39:42.480 --> 39:44.640
What's happening?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.800
Those soldiers
are attacking each other.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.800
WHOOSHING

39:50.800 --> 39:52.200
Serafina.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.440
Your daemons are in the tower.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.920
Cut them through to a safe world.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.360
I'll find you wherever you are.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.280
Go!

39:59.280 --> 40:01.880
How does it feel, Lord Asriel?

40:04.040 --> 40:06.280
Disowned by your child,

40:06.280 --> 40:09.680
and now betrayed
by the woman you love?

40:09.680 --> 40:11.080
HE GRUNTS

40:13.880 --> 40:15.560
Pan!

40:17.880 --> 40:19.920
Pan, we're coming!

40:27.000 --> 40:30.080
So, you did come.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.000
SNIFFING

40:42.960 --> 40:44.240
Will.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.240
How could you bear it?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.720
Leaving me behind?

40:54.640 --> 40:55.920
Marisa, no...

40:56.960 --> 40:58.800
HE GROANS

41:04.280 --> 41:05.640
HE COUGHS

41:05.640 --> 41:07.160
Ah...

41:07.160 --> 41:08.880
HE PANTS

41:12.040 --> 41:13.520
We should be together.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.360
Please.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.320
I'll cut us a window
to somewhere safe.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.360
Look, Asriel.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.720
Look at your fate.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.600
Ah!

41:29.600 --> 41:31.960
HE GROANS AND COUGHS

41:31.960 --> 41:33.800
HE GASPS

41:35.240 --> 41:37.080
HE GRUNTS

41:37.080 --> 41:39.200
The knife-bearer is in this world.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.120
He's with your daughter.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.920
Go, we'll find you!

42:05.080 --> 42:07.000
MACHINERY HUMS

42:18.920 --> 42:20.400
For Lyra.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.800
Cloud's gone.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.040
It's all gone.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.240
The war's over.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.520
Asriel won?

45:52.520 --> 45:53.800
I think so.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.240
INDISTINCT CONGRATULATIONS

46:41.480 --> 46:43.880
FAINT WHIRRING Do you feel that?

46:59.200 --> 47:00.720
FAINT WHIRRING

47:03.520 --> 47:05.160
There's someone in there.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.920
I'll try to cut them free.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.000
Machi! Aria!

47:32.720 --> 47:34.800
ARIA GIGGLES

48:03.440 --> 48:05.960
Can we go now? I want to see Pan.
