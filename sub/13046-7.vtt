13:03.642 --> 13:07.377
after you received the cure.

13:07.379 --> 13:11.248
You can keep fighting
us, thinking we're monsters,

13:11.250 --> 13:12.849
or you can cooperate,

13:12.851 --> 13:17.054
help us figure out what went
wrong and how to fix it.

13:17.056 --> 13:21.224
[Inhales deeply]

13:23.061 --> 13:27.664
I heard the call over the radio.

13:27.666 --> 13:30.667
The Americans are coming with the cure.

13:30.669 --> 13:35.472
We rushed to the port, thousands of us.

13:35.474 --> 13:37.541
Survivors.

13:39.644 --> 13:43.180
[Inhales deeply, exhales slowly]

13:43.182 --> 13:45.849
The ships arrived.

13:45.851 --> 13:49.419
American ships.

13:49.421 --> 13:53.824
And we lined up to
receive our injections.

13:55.426 --> 13:57.928
They told us to spread out,

13:57.930 --> 14:02.432
to pass the cure on to
the rest of our people.

14:04.769 --> 14:07.337
Soon...

14:07.339 --> 14:08.705
there was no way to tell

14:08.707 --> 14:13.944
who had the cure and who did not....

14:13.946 --> 14:17.047
because everyone died.

14:17.049 --> 14:19.416
But other than the U.S. Navy,

14:19.418 --> 14:23.353
who had custody of the
cargo once it landed?

14:23.355 --> 14:26.389
Could someone have tampered
with the doses on the pier?

14:26.391 --> 14:28.725
No. How can you be so sure?

14:28.727 --> 14:30.660
We delivered to dozens of
countries on this ship.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.496
We always worked with
the local partners...

14:32.498 --> 14:35.065
I was a local partner, Captain.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.101
My crew was there.

14:38.103 --> 14:42.439
We'd made sure everyone received a dose.

14:42.441 --> 14:45.308
I was in charge.

14:47.712 --> 14:51.047
I was responsible.

14:51.049 --> 14:55.152
That's why you wanted those
ships out of Okinawa.

14:55.154 --> 14:57.287
That's why you
wanted to punish the people

14:57.289 --> 14:58.722
that brought you the cure.

15:03.127 --> 15:06.429
But why work with Peng?

15:06.431 --> 15:09.166
I did not work with Peng. Oh, come on.

15:09.168 --> 15:11.635
The coincidence is too great.

15:11.637 --> 15:13.436
You kidnapped my men in Hai Phong

15:13.438 --> 15:14.704
at precisely the same moment

15:14.706 --> 15:16.606
Peng blows up my plane in Hong Kong?

15:16.608 --> 15:22.112
I do not call that coincidence, Captain.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.683
I call that luck.

- You ain't my lawyer.

16:45.725 --> 16:49.127
No, sir. I'm not. I'm a reporter.

16:56.969 --> 16:58.837
For the murder of Dr. Rachel Scott,

16:58.839 --> 17:00.605
you were given a military tribunal,

17:00.607 --> 17:02.640
so the case was sealed.

17:02.642 --> 17:04.876
Nobody's ever really
gotten a chance to hear

17:04.877 --> 17:06.277
your end of the story.

17:06.279 --> 17:08.079

17:09.950 --> 17:11.786
- [Camera chimes]

17:11.921 --> 17:13.718
More specifically, your interactions

17:13.720 --> 17:15.619
with now-President Jeffrey Michener.

17:24.363 --> 17:26.531
[Chains rattle]

17:28.567 --> 17:32.170
Ain't you gonna call "action"?

17:32.172 --> 17:33.338
[Beep]

17:33.340 --> 17:34.939
Jacob: Did he tell you
he was the President?

17:34.941 --> 17:36.441
<i>- Did he even know?
- Curtis: No.</i>

17:36.443 --> 17:38.810
<i>We didn't know he was President
when we met him.</i>

17:38.812 --> 17:40.945
<i>The way he was moaning and crying?</i>

17:40.947 --> 17:42.784
<i>- About what?
- About killing all those</i>

17:42.809 --> 17:44.315
<i>people inside the safe zone.</i>

17:44.317 --> 17:45.018
<i>What do you mean?</i>

17:45.020 --> 17:47.452
<i>He was Secretary of HUD.
He set up the quarantine.</i>

17:47.454 --> 17:48.987
<i>Except he broke it.</i>

17:48.989 --> 17:52.056
<i>He brought a sick kid into the stadium.</i>

17:52.058 --> 17:54.459
<i>And after that, that
virus tore through the state</i>

17:54.461 --> 17:56.761
<i>pretty quick.</i>

17:56.763 --> 17:58.463
<i>Jeffrey was a mess, boy,</i>

17:58.465 --> 18:01.799
<i>walking around like a
zombie, ranting and raving.</i>

18:01.801 --> 18:04.369
<i>"I did it. I killed them all."</i>

18:04.371 --> 18:07.705
<i>He didn't know which way was up.</i>

18:07.707 --> 18:10.008
<i>And then he found us.</i>

18:10.010 --> 18:13.077
[Beep]

18:13.079 --> 18:16.447
Mr. President, these
documents clearly show

18:16.449 --> 18:19.317
that you authorized to
have your son transported

18:19.319 --> 18:21.319
from a known hot zone in
Michigan down to Florida.

18:21.321 --> 18:22.887
It's public record.

18:22.889 --> 18:25.890
The outbreak in Ann
Arbor started after Brian left.

18:25.892 --> 18:29.027
Two days after. And the
travel ban was already in effect.

18:29.029 --> 18:31.362
- You knew the risk you were taking.
- No, listen to me, Jacob.

18:31.364 --> 18:34.032
The quarantine in the
stadium was porous.

18:34.034 --> 18:36.467
Dozens of infected people could and did

18:36.469 --> 18:37.769
get through the defenses.

18:37.771 --> 18:40.238
That's true, sir,

18:40.240 --> 18:43.441
but it appears that
isn't the way you saw it.

18:43.443 --> 18:46.244
You believe that you
were responsible for the death

18:46.246 --> 18:47.912
of tens of thousands of people.

18:47.914 --> 18:49.747
And if that was your mental condition

18:49.749 --> 18:51.282
when Captain Chandler found you,

18:51.284 --> 18:53.751
then what was your condition when
you took the oath of office

18:53.753 --> 18:56.554
a mere 11 days later?

18:56.556 --> 18:58.122
I take no pleasure in this, sir.

18:58.124 --> 18:59.791
No, you come into my
office and rehash this garbage?

18:59.793 --> 19:01.159
But the American people need to know

19:01.161 --> 19:02.694
if their Commander
in Chief is capable...

19:02.696 --> 19:03.861
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Get out!

19:03.863 --> 19:06.030
Shaw: Jeffrey, please. Jacob.

19:06.032 --> 19:07.765
- Now.
- This time, we're on the record.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.701
- So if I should know something else...
- Out!

19:09.703 --> 19:11.803
Now, Jacob. Now, Jacob.

19:21.814 --> 19:24.816
- [Sighs]
- Is this true?

19:30.422 --> 19:32.790
[Exhales softly]

19:32.792 --> 19:35.326
[Footsteps retreat]

19:35.328 --> 19:38.363
Maybe we just
delivered a bad batch to Japan.

19:38.365 --> 19:41.866
- It spoiled in transit or...
- Unlikely.

19:41.868 --> 19:43.701
I've been delivering the
cure all over the world.

19:43.703 --> 19:45.303
This has never happened before.

19:45.305 --> 19:47.372
Well, there's no reason to
take the word of a pirate

19:47.374 --> 19:49.407
who captured,
tortured, and killed your men.

19:49.409 --> 19:51.509
We have his blood, Sasha.

19:51.511 --> 19:54.579
The cure clearly didn't work on him.

19:54.581 --> 19:55.980
Something happened in Japan.

19:55.982 --> 19:58.950
Well, then maybe it
was a mutation after all.

20:00.686 --> 20:04.155
Okay, I know Dr. Scott said
that the virus cannot mutate.

20:04.157 --> 20:06.524
You've been very clear about that.

20:06.526 --> 20:08.926
But with no other explanation,

20:08.928 --> 20:11.829
isn't it possible that
in this one instance

20:11.831 --> 20:14.265
Dr. Scott was wrong?

20:14.267 --> 20:15.867
[P.A. beeps]

20:26.680 --> 20:28.212
We're surrounded, sir.

20:28.214 --> 20:29.647
Two ships on either side

20:29.649 --> 20:31.316
painting us with navigational radar.

20:31.318 --> 20:33.318
Damn it. They used our time in
the islands to set a perimeter.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.586
- Sasha: So we go dark again?
- Negative.

20:35.588 --> 20:37.855
They see a speck of
light on the horizon,

20:37.857 --> 20:39.991
we can't suddenly
disappear. They can both see us.

20:39.993 --> 20:42.593
They've gotta have
us triangulated by now.

20:42.595 --> 20:44.462
CIC, Bridge.

20:44.464 --> 20:46.264
<i>Be ready to fire

20:46.266 --> 20:48.566
Ready all fire stations. All
stations manned and ready.

20:48.568 --> 20:50.168
Standing by for batteries release.

20:50.170 --> 20:53.738
Two ships. Where are the other two?

20:53.740 --> 20:55.106
Prepare to break EMCOM,
find targeting solutions.

20:55.108 --> 20:58.042
- Aye, sir.
- They're hailing us, sir.

20:58.044 --> 20:59.911

us with their fire control, sir.

for long. They're closing in.

ahead. We can use it as a mask.

We head to the pass and
come to full stop.

Kaito. [Kisses]

30:38.521 --> 30:39.988
The Chinese are likely employing

30:39.990 --> 30:41.857
a standard line abreast search pattern

30:41.859 --> 30:43.725
with spacing at 80%
of their radar range.

30:43.727 --> 30:44.509
That's right.

30:44.756 --> 30:46.862
My guess is they'll
circle back from open water

30:46.864 --> 30:48.997
and close in on us hiding in the pass.

30:48.999 --> 30:51.867

long before they find us.

Only one.

Take on all four ships.

31:01.412 --> 31:04.946
Wait till their search pattern
brings them back in range,

31:04.948 --> 31:07.015

hell out of the way.

way they won't hit us back.

fight, we'll sink 'em all.

Cameron: At the first
hit on passive radar,

31:18.729 --> 31:20.762
the helo and RHIB will
launch simultaneously,

31:20.764 --> 31:24.099
each one heading 180
degrees from our course,

31:24.101 --> 31:26.401
blasting surface
radar to confuse the enemy.

31:26.403 --> 31:28.770
DC Central will be
posted at all zebra boundaries.

31:28.772 --> 31:30.272
First order of business...

31:30.274 --> 31:33.375
report and repair any
damage due to missile attack.

31:33.377 --> 31:34.976
Immediately seal all compartments

integrity of this vessel.

31:37.247 --> 31:40.382
On my mark, we will break
EMCOM and energize spy radar.

31:40.384 --> 31:43.618
We will have no more than
10 seconds to find and kill

32:04.708 --> 32:08.944
your ship is currently positioned

32:10.580 --> 32:12.814
You have evaded the
Chinese for the moment,

to the Zhulong Atoll for protection.

34:03.961 --> 34:06.294
This was part of the plan, I take it?

34:06.296 --> 34:10.197

Keep her so.

heading directly into open water.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.570
Once they have a clear path,

34:15.572 --> 34:18.106
they can triangulate and
fire on us almost immediately.

34:18.108 --> 34:21.610
I strongly recommend we set course 0-5-5.

- It was not Peng.

you in Vietnam by a smuggler.

bunch of American sailors?

40:05.140 --> 40:08.942
Ones marked...

40:08.944 --> 40:11.078
like this.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.313
What's so special about those ships?

40:13.315 --> 40:15.149
I did not care to ask.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.251
At the time,

40:17.253 --> 40:20.521
all I wanted was revenge.

40:22.991 --> 40:25.259
This smuggler have a name?

40:27.862 --> 40:29.696
Wu Ming.

40:33.835 --> 40:35.702
Ring a bell?

40:35.704 --> 40:37.438
He has my watch.

40:37.440 --> 40:42.376
I know where to find him...
a place called Shanzhai.

40:47.916 --> 40:49.316
We clear to broadcast?

40:49.318 --> 40:51.251
EMCON Alpha has been lifted.

40:51.253 --> 40:53.053
You have St. Louis.

40:53.055 --> 40:54.955
Stand by for CNO.

40:54.957 --> 40:57.224
This is CNO.

40:57.226 --> 40:58.725
We got him.

41:02.263 --> 41:05.547
- I need to see the President.
- Sorry, ma'am, no visitors tonight.

41:05.741 --> 41:07.634
He's not answering his phone.
I have word from Nathan James.

41:07.636 --> 41:09.670
Those are our orders. I'm sorry.

41:09.672 --> 41:12.005
Agent Costas, I am the
Deputy Chief of Staff

41:12.007 --> 41:13.507
and I am issuing you a direct order.

41:13.509 --> 41:15.075
Open this door.

41:19.013 --> 41:21.315

41:24.119 --> 41:26.753

41:33.228 --> 41:35.095
