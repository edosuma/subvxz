<i>No!</i>

07:29.866 --> 07:32.066
No...

08:08.205 --> 08:11.473
Those people in the Caravan,
you can't have that, Dan.

08:11.475 --> 08:12.775
<i>They need to go.</i>

08:12.777 --> 08:14.977
Tomorrow,
I've told them.

08:14.979 --> 08:16.544
I've explained
all this.

08:16.546 --> 08:19.548
It's just a matter of
commercial confidentiality.

08:19.550 --> 08:21.316
Which we're
paying you for.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.652
<i>For what you're paying, it
can't be much of a secret.</i>

08:33.330 --> 08:34.529
How's the cow?

08:34.530 --> 08:36.197
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

08:36.198 --> 08:38.432
John wants to check
her quickly.

08:40.871 --> 08:42.337
There's no need

<i>Back a bit.</i>

08:55.519 --> 08:57.353
[Orla sighs]

08:58.722 --> 09:00.121
Try and go lower.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.458

to him like an eejit...

09:02.460 --> 09:04.559
<i>Why can't you pay
on time?</i>

09:04.561 --> 09:07.530

09:07.532 --> 09:09.430
<i>I'm not sure he was
the best candidate.</i>

09:09.432 --> 09:11.766
He was the only fuckin'
candidate, thanks to me,

09:11.768 --> 09:13.335
and you haven't
paid me either.

09:13.337 --> 09:14.837
[sighs]

09:14.839 --> 09:15.904
<i>See the head?</i>

09:21.078 --> 09:22.845
I think it's okay.

09:31.789 --> 09:34.355
Something nipped
my hand, John.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.401
Muscle pressure
from the cow,

09:45.403 --> 09:48.704
maybe compressed it against the bone.
Who knows.

09:51.442 --> 09:53.342
I felt something,
John.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.479
I felt it snapping
at me.

09:58.481 --> 10:01.183
Those last safety checks,
everything was okay?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.483
Yes.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.053
All of them?

10:04.055 --> 10:05.853
Yes.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.923
Maybe we should
terminate it.

10:07.925 --> 10:09.792
That calf looks normal,
doesn't it?

10:13.598 --> 10:14.963
It's okay, then.

11:03.781 --> 11:05.547
Everything okay?

11:05.549 --> 11:07.783
(Orla)
<i>He says so.</i>

11:07.785 --> 11:09.785
Is that what you think?

11:10.721 --> 11:12.321
<i>I'm just the vet.</i>

11:13.857 --> 11:16.258
Screwing him,
are you, Orla?

11:18.194 --> 11:20.696
It's none of your
business, Dan.

11:20.698 --> 11:22.296
Why?

11:23.668 --> 11:25.300
I thought...

11:27.370 --> 11:29.905
I thought you could change.
I mean, you should...

11:29.907 --> 11:31.807
<i>[clatters dishes]</i>

11:34.711 --> 11:36.310
Well...

11:38.883 --> 11:41.217

she starts to go.

12:31.201 --> 12:34.002

15:24.943 --> 15:26.009
You want my help?

15:26.011 --> 15:27.510
I have a cow,
she's...

15:27.512 --> 15:29.077
Why would I want
to help you?

15:29.079 --> 15:30.413
What happened
to you?

15:30.415 --> 15:32.114
This is no problem
here, okay?

Quiet!

16:59.869 --> 17:02.170
Vet should've
been here.

17:02.172 --> 17:05.775
That's a good idea, you should
get him here. He'll sort it out.

17:05.777 --> 17:09.611
We have no time. I got to get a
move on, we could loose them both.

31:07.385 --> 31:10.386
It's a genetic

Like in these tests.

31:13.558 --> 31:14.958

It's a fetus, Dan.

33:27.659 --> 33:30.627
John wanted to make
a genetic modification

33:30.629 --> 33:34.330
to create
more fertile calves.

33:34.332 --> 33:38.034

and be fertile younger.

Don't let anyone near that cow. Lock
the door and keep away from it.

34:11.237 --> 34:13.237
The same for the cow
in the winter shed.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.471
Keep the other

34:17.609 --> 34:19.877
There could be danger

35:57.776 --> 36:01.712
All right, you'll find the feed,

36:01.714 --> 36:03.780
Give them some water

All right. Thanks.

It looks clean enough. I'll put
some more disinfectant on it.

37:02.708 --> 37:04.775

37:08.047 --> 37:10.346
You should go

No, thanks, I have to wait for the vet.
I'll go back with her.

37:28.335 --> 37:32.669
There's six of us.
I'm the second.

It's close.
Close family.

with the traveler boy?

37:48.220 --> 37:49.887
Do they like him?

37:51.190 --> 37:53.123
Are you popular
with his crowd?

You're, uh, just in the

You can't be messing around

you out, quick as you like,

All right, Dan, just a bit
of advice, that's all.

I wanted to ask you if you
knew that Orla Buckley's car
