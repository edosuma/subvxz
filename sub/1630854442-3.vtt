WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:03.420
You know, honey,

00:03.420 --> 00:07.215
I'm not sure a lot of this North Pole
stuff actually plays in the real world.

00:07.215 --> 00:09.676
Ooh. Yikes.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.428
You shouldn't even been wearing that here.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.679
Yeah, you're right about that.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.140
I don't think
that I'm going to be bringing any

00:15.140 --> 00:17.350
of my Mrs. Claus bathing suits with me.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.186
At least I've got the important stuff.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.606
Ah, my BlackBerry. Got it.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.443
Still got half a battery.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.570
Oh, Scott.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.240
- My jeans.
- Mmm.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.576
- You want a moment alone with them?
- Maybe.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.746
What did you guys do with our clothes?

00:37.746 --> 00:39.289
Oh, everything's taken care of, sir.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.708
A house in the Chicago suburbs.
Fully furnished.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.960
Complete wardrobes for the entire family.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.421
Everything you need.
You'll have no reason to complain.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.424
- That's a good one, Betty.
- Good what?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.844
Noel, why are you here?

00:53.553 --> 00:56.931
Just hanging out with my best friend.
Spending every moment with him.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.185
Until Santa leaves me forever.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.438
Well, that may not happen.
Unless you get me some better candidates.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.939
I think you're being a little picky.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.567
Whoa. Betty, I wanna leave the North Pole
in good shape.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.277
But you are still leaving?

01:09.277 --> 01:12.155
Yeah, that's why I packed everything,
including my bomber jacket.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.990
Now that is vintage, right?

01:13.990 --> 01:16.493
Oh, so that's the smell.
I thought a cow died in here.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.704
- Another good one, Betty.
- Good what?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.541
Interviews in 15 minutes, sir.
Candidates have already arrived.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.299
No way.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.760
Dad, wake up! Dad!

01:33.760 --> 01:35.512
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
All right, it's okay! Don't panic!

01:37.138 --> 01:39.474
Uh, we've just been abducted
by very bad people.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.226
Bad people don't set out cookies.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.978
Don't eat that! It might have poison, or--

01:47.398 --> 01:50.110
This is the best thing
that I've ever tasted in my life.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.903
Hey, your nose is all better.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.408
What is this place?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.286
And what are we wearing?

02:00.286 --> 02:03.081
We're at the North Pole.
The elf said you'd been summoned.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.459
Wait, that really happened?
I thought that was a dream.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.212
Is it possible
this is really the North Pole?

02:09.212 --> 02:11.214
These pillows are marshmallows!

02:11.214 --> 02:13.299
No, no, don't eat that!
We might get charged for it.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.018
Yeah, it's the North Pole.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.291
I think you're gonna miss this place
a lot more than you're admitting.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.500
Well, of course I am.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.252
- This is where we raised our kids.
- Hmm.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.463
This is where Cal and Sandra learned
to ride their first reindeer.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.382
They had their first day of yule.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.386
I am looking forward
to our next chapter though.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.347
- Yeah, me too. Me too.
- Yeah?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.641
I've been making a list
of the things I wanna do in Chicago,

03:03.641 --> 03:05.059
and none of them involve a chimney.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.437
- Pizza--
- No!

03:07.437 --> 03:08.855
Or an elf screaming.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.274
- No, no, no!
- No, listen. I got it. I love you.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.859
- I love you too.
- You pack.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.361
Pack?

03:15.361 --> 03:16.946
- Crouton!
- How could you?

03:16.946 --> 03:18.907
Will you just get out of my room?

03:18.907 --> 03:21.910
The girl Claus taped pictures to her wall.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.078
- Hmm.
- And is that a thumbtack?

03:24.078 --> 03:27.498
They've been on her wall for years.
What's the problem?

03:27.498 --> 03:30.793
The problem is, I was never told,

03:30.793 --> 03:34.714
and none of this was ever cleared
by the North Pole Preservation Society.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.049
They reject everything.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.760
Do you know how long it took me
to get the puppet show out of our room?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.303
It's a miracle we have kids.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.471
- Ugh.
- Sorry.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.139
I'm going to have to write up a report.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.807
Ooh.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.643
Yes! I love writing reports.

03:48.728 --> 03:52.065
I thought you were supposed to gather
stuff to set aside for the real world.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.360
The North Pole is the real world.
And I'm not leaving.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.611
Okay-- Oh.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.279
Good talk.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.114
Don't worry. I'm excited about leaving.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.075
I'm even making a list
of things I wanna do.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.576
Like, meet a crossing guard.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.704
Um, use those hand-drying things
in public bathrooms.

04:06.704 --> 04:11.042
Avoid bills by putting them in trash bags
and then hiding them behind a couch.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.962
- Mm-hmm.
- Be a part of a C-boarding group.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.965
Ooh! And learn what a time zone is. Uh...

04:18.049 --> 04:19.384
Ooh, jury duty!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.053
- Look at that!
- I'm seeing it!

04:22.053 --> 04:24.681
- Look at that! Look at that!
- I'm seeing it! I'm seeing it!

04:26.808 --> 04:28.601
It's the most magical place in the world!

04:28.601 --> 04:30.561
It is, but, uh, play it cool, okay?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.647
Oh, my God! So many elves!

04:32.647 --> 04:34.232
Am I allowed to say "elf"?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.817
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.902
In a way, you are dreaming.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.532
This place isn't real.
At least, not like you think.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.200
I'm sorry. What's happening?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.910
You know what? It doesn't matter.

04:45.910 --> 04:49.956
Because when you wake up at home,
you'll have no memory of ever being here.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.209
- I'll remember.
- Well, of course you will, sweetheart.

04:54.210 --> 04:58.172
Oh, my gosh. Where are my manners?
I never introduced myself. I'm Mrs. Claus.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.301
- No way.
- Yeah.

05:01.301 --> 05:06.889
Oh, you look far too young and stunning
to be a Mrs. Claus.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.516
- Oh.
- Look who it is.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.060
You're now my favorite candidate.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.478
Oh, a candidate for what?

05:12.478 --> 05:16.733
- Oh, um--
- Oh, my God! [gasps] Simon Choksi!

05:16.733 --> 05:19.777
You're my gaming lord and savior.
I can't believe you're real.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.030
- Can I touch you?
- No, Cal! No touching.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.656
Oh, Cal, is it? It's a good name.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.410
Oh, m-my full name is Buddy Calvin Claus,
but everyone just calls me Cal.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.287
Well, get in here! We'll take a selfie.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.164
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry, no. No photos.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.292
Um, there's a lot of ridiculous rules
around here, but that's a really big one.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.376
Oh, that's too bad.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.338
Hey, why don't you take these--
these guys around?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.090
Simon has a lot of time
before he gets to meet with Santa.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.551
Meet Santa?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.178
- We get to meet Santa?
- Yeah.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.388
You're not teasing me, are you?
I get teased a lot.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.723
Aw.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.851
You really don't know why you're here,
do you?

05:54.395 --> 05:57.106
Wait, that's why I'm here?
To be the new Santa?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.734
Yes!
Can't wait to rub this in Brady's face.

05:59.734 --> 06:03.363
Well, you don't have the job just yet.
You got a 65% completion rate.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.407
It's probably good enough
for the NFL Hall of Fame, but up here,

06:06.407 --> 06:08.117
we kind of look for a 100%.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.620
Well, I'm pretty sure I can pull it off
with no pass rush.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.623
Well, there's no pass rush,
but there are some security problems.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.124
We got NORAD.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.668
Their radar's getting much better
at tracking us, right?

06:17.668 --> 06:19.921
We've got chimney raccoons. Oh, boy.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.800
Sketchy pastries on plates.
You never know how long it's been there.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.551
You got a mayonnaise problem sometimes.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.388
So got to watch out for that.
You got your Christmas deniers.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.890
And you got your Santa traps.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.643
Santa traps? What's-- What's that?

06:33.643 --> 06:35.269
Let's say you're going down a chimney,

06:35.269 --> 06:38.815
you pop in, you see a tree,
the garland's just slipped off.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.609
You decide to be a nice Santa
and pick it up, put it back on the tree.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.528
You grab the garland...
...grabs your hand.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.405
You pull it, you're in a trap.
Just like that.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.698
You see, with me,
I wouldn't pull the garland.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.868
Yeah. And who would, right?
That's good. Okay, okay.

06:50.868 --> 06:54.038
How about this?
Give us your best "ho ho ho."

06:54.038 --> 06:55.873
Oh, okay. Here we go.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.376
Ho ho Homaha! Homaha!

06:58.876 --> 07:01.087
You see that?
I called a little audible there.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.425
He's odd, yet somehow perfect.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.509
He's odd, all right.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.928
I don't know if we have a hat big enough
for that head.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.638
Phew. Look at the size of that thing. Hmm.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.099
What's gotten into you?
We need to find someone quickly.

07:13.724 --> 07:14.725
What's the rush?

07:14.725 --> 07:16.853
Well, breaking in new Santas take time.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.605
Breaking in a Santa?
We're talking about Santas, not horses.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.232
I know. Horses listen.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.900
Ha! That's a good one.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.026
You still here?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.028
Me? I was kidnapped.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.990
One minute I'm cleaning rain gutters,
and next minute, I'm here.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.617
By the way, I'm gonna need a note
from you for my wife.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.872
Hey, Big Man!
On a scale of epic to super epic,

07:35.872 --> 07:37.999
how "giganticous"
do you want your farewell party?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.835
That won't be necessary, little man.
It's always nice to meet a big fan.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.086
Here's an autograph.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.511
Michelangelo gave me this shirt!

07:50.511 --> 07:52.263
It's worth more now, trust me.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.724
Peyton, he was talking to me
about my farewell party.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.102
Listen, low-key.
I mean it. No muss, no fuss.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.480
No muss, no fuss.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.526
Who's the dead elf that's gonna tell
Mariah Carey she's no longer performing?

08:06.611 --> 08:07.612
I sing, by the way.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.989
No, Brady can sing.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.657
Anyhow, thanks so much.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.495
And here you go. Santa's Workshop.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.831
I never wanna leave here.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.419
Wow. Being here really makes you forget
about all your problems in the real world.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.506
Oh, hey! Is it true in the real world
there's a thing called "gridlock,"

08:26.506 --> 08:29.050
where traffic just stops
and you get to know your neighbor?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.511
That's one way to look at it.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.179
Wow.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.431
Oh, hey!

08:35.431 --> 08:39.060
Is it true that shopping carts fit
into each other like little nesting dolls?

08:39.060 --> 08:40.937
And telemarketers just call you?

08:42.104 --> 08:44.315
I can't wait to get my first sunburn!

08:44.315 --> 08:47.652
Those are all things, I guess.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.531
But there is nothing like this place.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.075
Yeah, it's okay, I guess.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.577
I hate that we won't remember it.

08:56.577 --> 09:00.164
Here, sweetie.
Some rules are meant to be broken, okay?

09:01.832 --> 09:02.750
Time to meet Santa.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.255
Oh. Okay. Wow. I'm ready.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.840
I wish I'd brought him something.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.260
Uh, but what do you give Santa?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.053
He's into NFTs.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.097
Nutty fudgy tea cakes.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.100
We can make sure
you meet him after your dad.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.228
Buddy Calvin Claus,
could you watch the girl person?

09:22.228 --> 09:25.690
My lack of maternal fortitude
will only make us both uncomfortable.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.359
Okay, honey.
Be careful, all right?

09:28.359 --> 09:29.777
It's the North Pole, Dad.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.988
It's the North Pole!

09:31.988 --> 09:33.239
Let's go.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.367
Oh! Hey, hey!

09:36.367 --> 09:39.287
Is it true, in the real world,
there's, like, a whole department

09:39.287 --> 09:42.164
of motor vehicles and you get to go there?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.042
I ride a bike, but... hmm.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.127
Wow.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.799
- Cal, why do you have a human kid?
- I'm in charge of showing her around.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.010
- I know this place better than you do.
- That is not true.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.636
Okay. Then what's that lever do?

09:55.636 --> 09:57.179
Uh...

09:57.179 --> 10:00.766
- It makes things better. Yeah.
- Mmm?

10:00.766 --> 10:01.851
Mm-hmm.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.981
Oh! Great. Thank you.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.191
I needed a new nightmare anyways. Yeah.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.193
Well, I will give you the good tour.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.324
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.908
Simon Choksi.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.911
Listen. Hold on.
I don't want you to be nervous here.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.330
Oh, why would I be nervous?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.582
Because you're interviewing
to become Santa Claus.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.709
Sorry, sorry.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.419
That's all right. They're just priceless.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.046
Um, do you want a drink of something?

10:30.046 --> 10:32.340
Uh, chocolate milk? Strawberry Quik?
Pick your poison.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.716
Uh, I'm sorry. What's happening?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.301
Okay.

10:35.301 --> 10:40.306
Santa Claus is considering stepping down,
looking for a possible replacement.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.557
Now it's been challenging,

10:41.557 --> 10:45.102
but your name came up as a person
with great possibilities.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.812
So I wanna hear a little bit about you.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.816
Wow, okay. Uh...

10:51.776 --> 10:52.777
Uh, well, s-sure.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.696
Uh, so, you know,
I-I started, uh, as a game designer.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.365
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.
- But then I expanded.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.494
And, uh, my company, EverythingNow!,
is, uh, spiraling out of control

11:01.494 --> 11:03.829
because our delivery system is a mess.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.540
That's why there's the really mean GIF--
I don't know if you've seen it.

11:06.540 --> 11:10.711
It's going around calling my company
"Random Thingy Delivered Sometimes."

11:11.921 --> 11:14.924
You haven't done a lot of job interviews,
have you, Simon?

11:14.924 --> 11:18.052
You know, can I ask you a question?
It's about your delivery system.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.762
Why would I wanna hire you?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.307
Uh, well, uh--

11:24.058 --> 11:25.059
You know, I--

11:26.060 --> 11:27.478
Great "communitator."

11:28.646 --> 11:29.855
How about that drink?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.524
Uh, make it a double.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.566
Okay, good.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.862
Did you say chocolate, vanilla, or--

11:36.862 --> 11:38.656
Were you told no photos?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.033
Yes. A lot.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.370
Right, but you tech guys just aren't
used to people saying "no" to you, huh?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.831
Oh, actually,
everybody tells me "no" all the time.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.374
But you don't listen, do you?

11:48.374 --> 11:50.751
- Um, Dad? Hey.
- Hey.

11:50.751 --> 11:51.836
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.004
Oh, I don't think
you're interrupting at all.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.715
We're done here, Simon. Thank you so much.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.968
- Yeah, I sort of lost his daughter.
- Oh.

11:58.968 --> 11:59.885
Grace?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.429
Oh, I got to find her!

12:01.429 --> 12:02.888
No, no, no. Don't worry about it!

12:02.888 --> 12:04.849
We have great security here
at the North Pole!

12:04.849 --> 12:07.768
The elves will find her!
They'll find anything! No--

12:07.768 --> 12:09.437
Well, she was with Sandra.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.397
Oh, no.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.776
So this is Dancer, and that's Prancer.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.737
Next to him is Comet,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.991
and over there is Vomit,
who has to stay clear of the others.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.784
How do they fly?

12:24.910 --> 12:25.911
Good question.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.164
Did you ever hear the theory
about bumblebees?

12:28.164 --> 12:31.417
Well, their wings are too small
to lift their body mass.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.085
Experts finally concluded that

12:33.085 --> 12:35.880
the only reason they can fly
is 'cause they think they can fly.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.132
Same with reindeer.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.343
Santa convinced them that they could fly.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.637
Wow. No way.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.848
- Uh, uh, can I?
- Of course.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.226
It's okay.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.937
There you go.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.441
I hate that I have to leave here.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.442
I don't blame you.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.235
My dad's been making this dumb list

12:58.235 --> 13:00.488
of all the things he's gonna do
in the real world.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.281
You know what I can't do?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.699
Hug Prancer.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.036
I'm gonna miss him the most.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.205
You are my best friend.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.289
Aw.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.584
Wait. What?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.754
- D-Did you hear that?
- His grunt?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.964
No, he said actual words.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.257
Prancer, say something.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.846
Um, okay, I'm gonna go talk to someone
in the woods about this.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.598
Wait, uh, can I go with you?

13:27.598 --> 13:29.517
- You're cool!
- No, you can't--

13:30.017 --> 13:32.186
Wait. Did you call me cool?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.229
Yes.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.356
Okay, let's go.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.485
All right, this is E.L.F.S.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.195
Watch your head.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.113
Gary, we got a problem.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.450
You said you had
the best detective force in the world.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.952
E.L.F.S. Right here.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.578
Where is everyone?

13:49.578 --> 13:52.706
I'm the only one left.
Fudge-It cuts, you know?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.792
- What's a Fudge-It cut?
- Don't get him started.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.796
We get paid in fudge. After 20 years
of no crime in the North Pole,

13:58.796 --> 14:02.258
Betty decided extra fudge
would be better spent on the line workers.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.927
So the others left to make toys.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.388
Not me.
I'm getting too old for that shift.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.931
- Told you not to get him started.
- Wha--

14:08.931 --> 14:10.683
Listen, we have a little problem,
all right?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.893
My Sandra has left with his daughter.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.144
What do they look like?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.896
My Sandra, his daughter.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.690
Human females.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.025
Hold on. Let me check.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.361
Why does the North Pole need a jail?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.114
Pie crimes and mistletoe-meanors.

14:25.698 --> 14:30.202
We had a report of two non-elf females
spotted, headed toward the Wobbly Woods.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.163
And you didn't think that was
important enough to tell me?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.457
No elves dare step foot
in the Wobbly Woods.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.793
Oh, because of the "Christmas Witch."

14:37.793 --> 14:39.712
I've been face-to-face with her.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.425
An evil harpy with black eyes
and a dead pine cone for a heart.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.926
Goodness, you're intense.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.429
- All right, I'll go get them.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.139
I don't care if there's
a thousand witches.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.724
I'll fight 'em all to save Grace.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.434
Only one witch.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.563
But she can make a man
do things against his will.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.150
Yeah. And you better cut back
on the maple syrup. I saw that.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.152
All right, let's go.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.864
You know, Simon,
you could've stayed indoors.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.866
- Nope. I'm fine.
- Yeah?

15:08.866 --> 15:10.993
Is that teeth chattering or a woodpecker?

15:10.993 --> 15:14.246
Look, I don't care if I get frostbite.
I'm not stopping until I find Grace.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.790
Okay, well, you--
No, you're not gonna find Grace that way.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.626
- Come on. Come.
- Do you know where we're going?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.545
Yeah,
the Wobbly Woods are always changing.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.464
They're alive.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.049
Oh, well, that's great.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.301
So, your one kid lost my kid,

15:27.301 --> 15:31.180
and your other kid took her to the woods
that are alive and might have a witch.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.932
- That's just wonderful.
- Well, listen, Simon.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.226
Simon, no other applicant brought
their kid. You insisted on that.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.771
I bring her everywhere.
She's my everything.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.522
I named EverythingNow! after her.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.107
That's wonderful and kind of annoying

15:42.107 --> 15:44.068
since I'd already formed an opinion
about you.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.613
Well, that's fine by me. There's no way
that I can take on being Santa, all right?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.240
I'm giving it my all just to be
both mom and dad to my daughter.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.784
Her mom is where?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.495
Uh, she passed away two years ago.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.579
Oh.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.041
That's so sad for both of you.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.627
That's-- I'm sorry about that.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.711
Thank you.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.090
My number one goal right now
is just to try to make her happy.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.925
That's our number one job.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.470
We actually started a nonprofit
in her mom's name

16:11.470 --> 16:14.515
where we, uh,
we give toys to underserved kids.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.683
Well, that's horrible.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.227
You just rip my existence
right out from under me.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.353
Oh, sorry.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.481
You're-- You're kidding.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.733
No,
that's actually wonderful stuff you do.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.319
Listen,
the world could really use more of that.

16:27.319 --> 16:33.492
You know, um, when Grace's mom passed,
I-- I stopped believing in everything.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.621
It's really nice to see
that some magic still exists,

16:37.621 --> 16:40.040
but right now,
I wanna find Grace and bring her home.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.001
We're going to find Grace.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.502
- Oh, Grace's locket!
- Don't pick it up.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.838
Oh. Oh.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.881
What-- What's going on?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.175
My feet are stuck.
It's like-- It's like sticky snow.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.885
It's okay. It's okay.
Remember, I told you.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.179
This forest is alive
and, apparently, doesn't like you.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.015
Look, I'm gonna head over there--

16:59.018 --> 17:01.103
I didn't see that coming.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.357
Well, can-- can you use your magic
to get us out?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.985
Yeah.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.283
Oh, great. Great. You made it colder.
That's wonderful.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.454
I'm having a little problem with my magic.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.955
I suppose that makes you happy.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.373
Why would that make me happy?

17:22.833 --> 17:24.585
So much clucking.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.588
I thought the sticky snow
had caught two hens.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.175
Christmas Witch.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.343
Witch!

17:33.343 --> 17:35.429
Please don't tell me
you baked our girls into a pie.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.390
One witch bakes one kid into a pie
like a thousand years ago,

17:38.390 --> 17:39.600
and now it's a thing.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.187
Also, you know,
I don't like this word "witch."

17:43.187 --> 17:44.772
I'm La Befana.

17:44.772 --> 17:49.485
La Befana, it actually means "the witch,"
or if you'll forgive me, "the hag."

17:49.485 --> 17:51.820
But I had style.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.030
Yeah.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.575
All across Italy,
on the Feast of the Epiphany,

17:56.575 --> 17:59.661
I would fill the good children's sock
with candy

17:59.661 --> 18:01.747
and the bad children's sock with coal.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.833
Which, in winter,
is actually more valuable than candy.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.293
And how did you get to the houses?

18:07.503 --> 18:08.504
- A broom.
- Ha!

18:08.504 --> 18:09.505
Shut up!

18:09.505 --> 18:14.176
Back then, a witch couldn't get
a sleigh loan without a warlock to cosign.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.806
Now, you want to see the little girls?

18:20.557 --> 18:21.558
Let's go!

18:22.976 --> 18:23.977
Could you--

18:25.187 --> 18:26.438
Little help.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.526
Hello?

18:35.864 --> 18:38.033
I'm gonna get one of those sticks.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.829
Girls? Oh, girls?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.498
Can you vouch for these two trespassers?

18:44.998 --> 18:46.083
Daddy!

18:46.959 --> 18:49.211
- Honey, are you okay? Oh!
- Wow.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.630
- Hey, Dad.
- This place is so exciting.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.423
I wish we could stay here forever.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.800
You do?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.718
Who is this? Is this Grace?

18:56.718 --> 18:59.596
Sweetie, this is Sandra's father,
Mr. Claus.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.848
Or Santa.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.934
- Hello!
- Oh, well, hi there. Look at you.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.436
You like stuffed panda bears.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.355
- Yeah.
- Huh. I remember that.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.274
I'm glad you're okay.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.860
- Come here.
- Uh.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.405
What made you think
it was okay to bring Grace here?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.739
She came with me,

19:17.739 --> 19:21.410
and I had something important
that I needed to talk to La Befana about.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.079
La Befana, the witch that has
a pine-cone heart? That one?

19:24.079 --> 19:27.249
You've been talking to Gary?

19:27.249 --> 19:30.502
We had one date, like, 200 years ago.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.045
He's obsessed with me.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.173
Yeah, you certainly caught his eye.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.009
First, I can't be friends with animals.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.719
Now, I can't be friends with witches.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.889
And for your information,
I come here all the... time.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.390
What? Is that where you got fleas?

19:43.390 --> 19:46.643
No, I keep a clean covenstead!

19:47.561 --> 19:49.521
I mean, a house.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.690
Look, La Befana listens to me.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.275
You don't know anything about me.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.776
Sandra.

19:54.776 --> 19:55.986
Um.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.738
Hey, you should listen to her.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.490
She's a very, very special girl.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.534
Sandra!

20:02.534 --> 20:04.786
Hey, hold on, Sandra. Hold on!

20:04.786 --> 20:06.121
What? You mad?

20:06.622 --> 20:09.041
Yes, I'm mad.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.544
Then ground me here forever.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.047
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.926
Interesting. Go on.

20:19.801 --> 20:24.181
Listen,
I know that you don't wanna leave here.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.265
I get it.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.767
Well, do you?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.770
You keep making that dumb list
of all the awesome things you're gonna do

20:29.770 --> 20:31.188
when you aren't Santa.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.898
You mean this one?

20:33.732 --> 20:37.486
Yeah. It just says, "Buy a boat," and then
there's a bunch of doodles of boats.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.322
And then it says,
"Do I really want a boat?"

20:40.322 --> 20:43.408
Then there's doodles of boats
with X's through them.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.160
That's super sad, Dad.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.995
Do you know what I was thinking?

20:46.995 --> 20:49.915
That you could just lease a boat
with an option to buy?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.003
That's actually a good idea,
but, no, that's not what I was thinking.

20:55.003 --> 20:58.006
I was thinking, actually,
that I never wanted to be Santa Claus,

20:59.132 --> 21:02.803
which is why it was the most awesome
thing that's ever happened to me.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.850
Going with the flow is
the only way to tackle life.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.811
It's hard to go with the flow
when you're scared.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.021
I mean, I'm really scared, Dad.

21:13.021 --> 21:16.108
Of-- Of humans,
of anywhere that's not here.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.985
It's so embarrassing.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.949
It's okay to be afraid of the unknown.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.909
I'm scared too.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.121
- You are?
- Yeah.

21:29.746 --> 21:33.583
I think I'd be less scared
if we could be scared together.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.169
Yeah, me too.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.139
So you really didn't think
you were gonna be a good Santa?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.181
No.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.101
I was sure I wouldn't be a good Santa.
I thought it was the worst choice ever.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.978
So what happened?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.982
I started seeing it
through Charlie's eyes,

21:56.982 --> 21:58.734
and it changed me for the better.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.364
Maybe it was in me all the time,
and-- and I just didn't know it.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.914
Grace, um,
Santa asked me to be the next Santa.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.166
- What?
- But I said no.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.876
- What?
- And then he asked me again.

22:15.876 --> 22:19.921
Dad, don't be crazy! Take the job!
Be Santa! I love it here!

22:21.089 --> 22:22.090
You do love it here?

22:22.090 --> 22:23.050
Yes.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.011
Okay, I mean, I always said
I wanted to be on top of the world.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.096
I just never thought, you know, literally.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.098
- Dad.
- Okay!

22:30.098 --> 22:32.100
- I mean, I'll-- I'll take the job!
- Yay!

22:34.770 --> 22:37.522
Listen, you're gonna have to make
decisions a lot quicker on Christmas Eve.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.483
I-I-I can't believe
this is happening right now.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.526
- I have goose bumps.
- You know, it could be hives.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.988
I think we both picked up
a little something from the witch's house.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.991
Okay.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.286
With this ceremonial passing of the coat...

22:54.164 --> 22:59.086
...you become custodian of Christmas.

23:00.754 --> 23:01.880
- Oh, oh!
- Oh.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.340
- It's heavier than I thought.
- Okay.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.133
- Yeah.
- Sorry. [grunts] Whoa!

23:05.133 --> 23:06.301
Oh, hey! Whoa. Geez.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.845
Slippery little sucker.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.013
Thanks, honey.

23:10.722 --> 23:11.807
Stay there.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.684
Okay, well, that's about it.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.144
- Yeah.
- You guys ready?

23:16.144 --> 23:18.522
So, so, so ready.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.148
You gonna tell him about the Mrs. Clause?

23:20.148 --> 23:22.526
No. I think that'll be
a nice little surprise. Don't you?

23:22.526 --> 23:26.696
Okay, are you all ready to fall asleep
and wake up in your new life?

23:26.696 --> 23:28.907
I've got everything I need,

23:28.907 --> 23:31.743
and I'm looking forward to seeing
who I am when I'm not Santa.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.621
And I'm looking forward
to any identity whatsoever.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.958
Ready. We're ready, Edie.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.835
Okay. Get ready for the angel dust.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.170
I think we're gonna have
to call that something else.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.256
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.175
Wait, no. No, not the dust.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.677
Dad. Dad, please.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.303
I don't wanna forget this place.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.431
No. Listen,
only visitors lose their memory.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.849
You will never forget.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.436
The North Pole
will always be a part of you. Forever.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.020
- Just like all of us.
- Mmm.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.441
All right, here goes.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.360
I know an elf's scream when I hear it.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.945
- Seriously?
- That's Noel.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.072
I can't leave here without saying goodbye
to him.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.408
Try being married to that scream.

24:13.702 --> 24:17.456
Forgive me, Santa,
but I couldn't do nothing.

24:28.425 --> 24:32.929
<i>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart ♪</i>

24:32.929 --> 24:34.389

24:34.389 --> 24:36.224

Noel. Noel. Come on.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.938
It was perfect. It was perfect. Come on.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.232
I need a minute.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.901

I definitely have some big shoes to fill.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.122
From beginning to end,

25:41.122 --> 25:46.419
everything has always been just a bit off
in the most exquisite way.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.712
Uh, Mrs. Claus?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.839
I need to ask you a question.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.007
No, Crouton.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.510
I did not take the monogrammed towels
from the bathroom.

25:53.510 --> 25:57.430
I know, which is why
I discreetly placed them in your luggage.

25:57.430 --> 26:02.018
- Oh.
- My question is, may I have a hug?

Oh, my goodness. Bye.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.535
Okay.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.953
Maybe we should stay.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.289
It's too late to stay. You know what?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.666
This is gonna be great for us.
It really is.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.459
Look at this.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.923
Careful with that dust. Watch the dust.
Watch the--

26:31.923 --> 26:33.717
Oops.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.179
My bad.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.765
<i>Another chilly morning, folks.</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:44.019
<i>Which begs the question,
what's so great about Chicago?</i>

26:44.019 --> 26:45.604
<i>Lake Michigan...</i>

26:46.646 --> 26:48.064
- Honey, honey, honey!
- What?

26:48.064 --> 26:50.400
- Chicago. Home.
- Oh! Oh.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.152
I-- What? Oh.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.573
Wow! Where did the rest of me go?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.074
Literally, where does it go?

26:58.074 --> 27:00.827
And whose hair looks that good
when they first wake up?

27:00.827 --> 27:02.078
It's elf magic!

27:04.456 --> 27:07.250
Mom! Da--

27:08.335 --> 27:09.628
Sandra, it's me.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.589
Who-- Who are you?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.424
- It's Dad.
- I warned you this is what I look like.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.508
It's me.

27:15.508 --> 27:19.179
You-You didn't prepare me for this.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.640
What is happening?

27:22.265 --> 27:23.850
- Huh?
- I don't know.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.603
Cal!

27:26.603 --> 27:28.772
- Cal!
- Don't worry. It's Dad.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.856
Cal!

27:29.856 --> 27:31.775
Yeah. Hey, what's up?

27:31.775 --> 27:33.652
Guess who this random man is.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.445
A guy named Ron?

27:35.445 --> 27:36.696
- Ron?
- No.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.739
A guy named Greg?

27:38.615 --> 27:41.159
- Greg? Ron? What-- What-- It's Dad. Me.
- What is wrong with him?

27:41.159 --> 27:42.702
Oh, Dad!

27:42.702 --> 27:45.622
Oh. You warned me you'd look different,
but this is--

27:46.331 --> 27:47.666
I don't know.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.960
Are you-- Are you okay?
Is-- Is the real world killing you?

27:50.960 --> 27:52.045
- No, I'm fine.
- What?

27:52.045 --> 27:53.129
Stop touching me like that.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.173
Okay, well, I'm finer than fine.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.424
- Yeah?
-'Cause, guess what.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.677
- What?
- It's 8 degrees outside.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.053
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

28:00.053 --> 28:01.930
Above zero!

28:01.930 --> 28:03.348
- Summer!
- Yeah!

28:03.348 --> 28:04.432
Let's go.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.184
You look great.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.268
Welcome home.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.645
Yeah, right?

28:10.397 --> 28:11.648
- Look at that.
- Aw.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.442
Running through slush in their pj's.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.903
- They're so excited. This--
- Yeah.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.572
This is good.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.657
It's gonna work.

28:20.657 --> 28:21.741
Yeah.
