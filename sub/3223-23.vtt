00:02.210 --> 00:04.712
I'm about to close
the gates of hell forever.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.187
- You were in purgatory?
- It felt pure.

00:21.938 --> 00:25.608
- I don't hunt anymore. I found something.
- Did you look for me?

00:25.816 --> 00:27.693
Kevin Tran, thought you could elude me.

00:27.860 --> 00:31.614
God built a series of test. When you've
done, you can flood the gates of hell.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.658
- Where do we start?
- Kill a hound of hell.

00:33.824 --> 00:36.786
Innocent soul must be rescued
from hell and delivered to heaven.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.663
- The final test?
- To cure a demon.

00:40.873 --> 00:43.501
- Abaddon, the knight of hell.
- She's gone.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.670
My name is Naomi. We rescued you.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.926
- The angel tablet.
- I won't hurt Dean.

00:52.134 --> 00:53.427
Kill him.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.556
We're family.

00:56.764 --> 01:00.893
- I have to protect this tablet now.
- These trials, they're purifying me.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.813
- Uhn!
- Ha-ha.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.316
- Metatron?
- I'm the scribe of God.

01:07.483 --> 01:09.860
Heaven needs your help, Castiel.

01:13.781 --> 01:17.285
- I'm killing everyone you ever saved.
- Maybe we should take the deal.

01:17.451 --> 01:19.245
The trials, you'll give them up.

01:19.453 --> 01:21.581
Kick it in the ass. Like we always do.

01:22.039 --> 01:23.082
Are you with me?

01:31.382 --> 01:34.927
- On the house, sheriff.
- Oh. Thanks, Nance, but I didn't order...

01:35.136 --> 01:36.429
- So...
- Good luck.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.764
What are we drinking?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.892
Roderick?

01:42.059 --> 01:48.232
Wow. Jody, words cannot begin to describe the
injustice that, that picture does to you.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.446
Come on.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.867
- What?
- Look at you.

01:58.075 --> 02:01.203
The fancy career, the suit.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.583
I'm pretty much what I am,
a small-town girl.

02:05.791 --> 02:09.628
We do share something, you and I.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.174
- What?
- Loss.

02:23.434 --> 02:27.355
My son and my husband.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.107
How did you know?

02:34.153 --> 02:35.529
I've lost someone too.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.124
It's not a date till I've cried.

02:49.293 --> 02:51.128
So now you've cried.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.888
This is crazy.

03:01.972 --> 03:03.015
This is crazy.

03:03.265 --> 03:06.477
Heh. I'm crazy.

03:12.149 --> 03:14.485
He's attractive though, right?

03:16.237 --> 03:18.155
He's hot.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.803
I like big butts and I cannot lie

03:43.055 --> 03:46.851
You have less than one minute
before a very dear, attractive...

03:47.518 --> 03:50.521
...and slightly-tipsy friend
of yours snuffs it.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.898
- Call it off, Crowley.
- Because...?

03:54.734 --> 03:57.528
Because it's over, you son of a bitch.
We want a deal.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.280
Thirty seconds.

04:01.073 --> 04:04.160
- We stop the trials, you stop killing.
- I want the demon tablet.

04:04.326 --> 04:09.206
- The whole demon tablet.
- Fine, but then the angel tablet comes to us.

04:09.373 --> 04:12.293
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that you're a douche bag...

04:12.460 --> 04:15.421
...and no douche bag should have
that much power. Deal or not?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.677
First, I need to hear two little words.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.849
"I surrender."

05:06.514 --> 05:08.766
You hid the demon tablet
underneath the devil?

05:08.974 --> 05:10.684
- Seriously?
- What? I was delirious.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.822
You sure this is gonna work?

05:24.949 --> 05:26.200
What choice do we have?

05:26.408 --> 05:31.789
All right, listen.
This is a secret lair, you understand me?

05:32.623 --> 05:36.252
- No keggers.
- I don't have any friends.

05:37.586 --> 05:38.629
Well, just lay low.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.674
Who knows, you'll be a mathlete
again before you know it.

05:44.593 --> 05:45.636
Hey, guys?

05:47.763 --> 05:50.015
You're doing the right thing.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.526
What was he like?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.153
Who?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.491
God?

06:09.743 --> 06:11.328
Pretty much like you'd expect.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.331
Larger than life.

06:14.623 --> 06:15.666
Gruff.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.586
Bit of a sexist.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.172
But fair, eminently fair.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.095
The Nephilim was a monster, Castiel.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.847
And the next trial?

06:31.390 --> 06:32.516
Across the street.

06:33.225 --> 06:35.728
His name's Dwight Charles.

06:35.936 --> 06:40.733
I've been listening in on the angel radio.
Cupid frequency actually.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.861
And he is the next on their list.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.614
Their list?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.992
To do the horizontal mambo.

06:51.076 --> 06:52.578
Slap bellies.

06:54.663 --> 06:55.956
To find love?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.917
Oh, yes.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.336
Well, that.

07:00.544 --> 07:03.797
He's slotted to be dinged by
Cupid's arrow within 24 hours...

07:04.006 --> 07:09.219
...which is good for us because
the second trial is retrieving Cupid's bow.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.222
No killing?

07:14.975 --> 07:16.393
No killing.

07:47.257 --> 07:48.342
Hello, boys.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.888
What's that old expression?

07:53.555 --> 07:57.559
Success has many fathers,
failure is a Winchester? Heh.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.312
Where's the stone?

08:00.479 --> 08:02.356
You show us yours, we'll show you ours.

08:02.523 --> 08:05.526
Dean, I'm trying to conduct
a professional negotiation here...

08:05.693 --> 08:07.945
...and you wanna talk dangly bits?

08:08.153 --> 08:09.321
The stone.

08:11.198 --> 08:13.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slowly.

08:16.286 --> 08:17.413
There she is.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.252
The contract?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.385
Yeah, I'm sure there's no
hidden agendas in there.

08:31.552 --> 08:36.515
The highlights. We swap tablets,
you stand down from the trials forever.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.851
You stop killing everyone
we've ever saved.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.144
Agreed.

08:47.776 --> 08:52.239
Uh-uh-uh.
Nice try, squirrel.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.700
Moose is doing these trials, moose signs.

08:54.908 --> 08:58.704
No, no, no. He's not signing anything
until I read the fine print.

08:58.912 --> 09:02.416
- I can read it.
- Hey, you wanted me here, I'm here.

09:02.624 --> 09:05.252
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let him screw us even more.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.920
What's this?

09:07.087 --> 09:08.547
Trouble in paradise, boys?

09:15.971 --> 09:17.473
What is it, Nathaniel?

09:17.681 --> 09:20.392
One of our freelancers
has reached out to us.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.187
He's found Castiel.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.358
- Where?
- A drinking establishment.

09:28.567 --> 09:32.196
In Houston, Texas. And...

09:34.031 --> 09:35.866
What?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.535
He says Castiel was not alone.

09:39.828 --> 09:40.871
Who was he with?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.999
By the description, I think it was him...

09:44.583 --> 09:46.585
...the scribe.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.383
You're gonna move your lips
the whole way up here, aren't you?

09:55.177 --> 09:57.513
You know why I always defeat you?

09:57.721 --> 10:00.808
It's your humanity. It's
a built-in handicap.

10:01.016 --> 10:05.896
You always put emotion ahead
of good old-fashioned common sense.

10:08.857 --> 10:12.236
Let's have the big galoot sign it now,
shall we?

10:28.877 --> 10:30.838
Is this a joke?

10:33.048 --> 10:34.925
You realize, all I have to do is:

10:35.676 --> 10:39.888
Uh-uh-uh.
Demonic handcuffs, jackass.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.100
No flicking, no teleporting,
no smoking out.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.310
Oh, and no deal.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.939
Which pretty much means
that you're our bitch.

10:49.148 --> 10:53.110
Fine. You wanna play chain gang? Let's.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.572
You saddled yourself
to the wrong bull, mate.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.579
I could do this all day,
because you know what?

11:03.787 --> 11:05.205
Damn, it feels good.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.792
But sooner or later,
you're gonna have to face it.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.043
You're ours.

11:11.295 --> 11:16.550
Which means that your demon ass is going
to be a mortal ass pretty damn quick.

11:17.759 --> 11:21.305
- What's he mouthing on about?
- You're the third trial, Crowley.

11:29.646 --> 11:32.399
- What are you reading?
- Personal advertisements.

11:36.111 --> 11:40.532
The faster that man finds love,
the faster the Cupid will come.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.411
Trust me. I'm friends with friends
who do this for a living.

11:47.664 --> 11:49.208
- Help you, gents?
- Yes.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.378
Would you say that you're looking
for a partner in crime...

11:55.172 --> 11:56.840
...or, uh...

11:57.549 --> 12:02.179
...someone who's into nurse role-play
and light domination?

12:04.973 --> 12:07.517
Brother, it's 10 a.m. on a Tuesday.

12:07.684 --> 12:09.853
Uh... We'll have two drafts, please.

12:12.272 --> 12:13.815
Coming up.

12:15.525 --> 12:18.737
You are not the most subtle tool
in the shed, are you?

12:20.656 --> 12:22.324
Kill him.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.414
Next one won't wing you.
Take it someplace else.

12:33.126 --> 12:34.544
Let him go.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.172
Haven't you caused
enough harm already, Castiel?

12:37.381 --> 12:41.134
Stop. Please, Castiel,
don't make this any worse.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.303
Please.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.561
You really think this is gonna hold me?

13:33.437 --> 13:36.690
That you're gonna cure me
or whatever it is?

13:49.244 --> 13:50.954
He's primed.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.583
- How you feeling?
- Honestly?

13:55.375 --> 13:58.670
For the first time in a long time,
it feels like we're gonna win.

13:59.212 --> 14:00.255
I'm good.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.675
All right, no dancing in the end zone
until we're finished.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.636
What's the good Father's
playbook say now?

14:06.845 --> 14:08.513
Well...

14:08.722 --> 14:12.726
...now that we got
the consecrated ground, I just, uh, ahem...

14:12.934 --> 14:16.480
I slip Crowley one dose of blood
every hour for eight hours...

14:16.688 --> 14:19.983
...and seal the deal with a bloody
fist sandwich. That should do it.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.070
Your blood's supposed to be purified,
isn't it?

14:23.945 --> 14:24.988
You ever...?

14:25.947 --> 14:27.991
You ever done
the forgive-me-father before?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.160
Once. When we were kids.

14:31.286 --> 14:33.830
Which is why
I have no clue what to say now.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.958
I could give you suggestions, if you want.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.503
- Okay, yeah. Sure.
- All right.

14:39.711 --> 14:44.216
I'm just spit-balling here,
but if I were you...

14:44.383 --> 14:45.842
...uh...

14:46.385 --> 14:47.469
...Ruby.

14:49.429 --> 14:51.848
Killing Lilith. Letting Lucifer out.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.394
Losing your soul. Not looking for me
when I went to purgatory.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.771
- Thanks.
- For starters.

15:02.776 --> 15:06.947
Hey, how about what you did
to Penny Markle in the sixth grade?

15:07.155 --> 15:09.157
Why don't you lead with that?

15:09.491 --> 15:10.534
Well, that was you.

15:13.286 --> 15:15.080
Carry on.

15:41.022 --> 15:43.525
Okay. Um, ahem.

15:44.901 --> 15:46.903
If anybody is listening...

15:47.904 --> 15:49.573
...here goes.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.368
Dean, I need your help.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.246
Little busy, Cass. Take a number.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.207
I'm afraid this can't wait.
Naomi has taken Metatron.

16:02.752 --> 16:06.131
- You know Metatron how?
- I've been working with him on the angel trials.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.258
- The what?
- We're gonna shut it all down.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.427
Heaven. Hell. All of it.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.854
- I know you.
- We've never officially met.

16:23.523 --> 16:24.733
Naomi.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.031
Your reputation precedes you.

16:32.782 --> 16:36.369
- The archangels...
- Wanted me to debrief you after God left.

16:38.246 --> 16:40.123
Debrief me.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.209
Is that what you call it?

16:42.375 --> 16:45.337
How would you know?
You ran before I had the chance.

16:45.545 --> 16:48.757
But here we are.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.053
I just have one question before we begin.

16:53.261 --> 16:55.889
You had to know
that we would leap at the chance...

16:56.056 --> 16:59.309
...to extract all of God's secrets
from that head of yours.

16:59.893 --> 17:03.480
Which is why I ask myself, why?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.816
Why did the scribe suddenly come in
from the shadows?

17:10.403 --> 17:13.323
And what are you doing with Castiel?

17:19.246 --> 17:25.001
"Of the blessings set before you,
make your choice and be content."

17:28.838 --> 17:30.966
Not a big reader, are we?

17:35.178 --> 17:36.930
Metatron?

17:37.138 --> 17:41.434
The guy who was full-on crazy, cat lady,
hoarder angel yesterday...

17:41.601 --> 17:43.103
...now he wants to save heaven?

17:43.270 --> 17:45.689
Yes. He wants to.

17:45.897 --> 17:47.440
But I'm the only one who can.

17:49.859 --> 17:53.113
I can't fail, Dean. Not on this one.
I need your help.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.449
Cass, that's all well and good, okay?

17:56.658 --> 18:00.203
But you're asking me to leave Sam
when we've got Crowley tied and tressed.

18:00.370 --> 18:04.124
Now, if anybody needs a chaperone
while doing the heavy lifting it's Sam.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.585
You should go.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.672
- Seriously.
- What, and leave you here...

18:10.839 --> 18:12.757
...with the king of hell? Come on.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.634
I got this.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.221
And if you guys can
lock the angels up too...

18:18.805 --> 18:19.973
...that's a good day.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.354
Look, I...

18:27.314 --> 18:31.026
I'm down with sending the angels back
to heaven just because they're dicks...

18:31.234 --> 18:33.778
...but the demons? This is on us.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.281
Start the injections now.

18:36.489 --> 18:38.783
If I'm not back in eight hours, finish it.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.327
No questions, no hesitation.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.246
Yeah.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.777
You really think injecting me with
human blood is gonna make me human?

19:13.943 --> 19:16.780
Did you read that
on the back of a cereal box?

19:17.989 --> 19:19.574
Aah!

19:28.416 --> 19:29.459
Hmm.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.173
You're miles out of your league, moose.

19:37.425 --> 19:39.928
See you in an hour.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.144
Is this a joke?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.772
No, it's the word of God.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.565
- What?
- It's a tablet.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.442
Now translate. That's what you do.

19:55.318 --> 19:58.196
Okay, it's the angel tablet...

19:58.405 --> 20:01.157
...which I've never laid
eyes on in my life.

20:01.574 --> 20:04.077
You want a translation in,
like, six hours...

20:04.285 --> 20:06.663
...when it took me six months
and a dead mom...

20:06.830 --> 20:10.291
...to translate a piece
of the demon tablet?

20:10.834 --> 20:14.295
And according to your own words
this morning...

20:14.504 --> 20:17.632
...this is not what I do, it's what I did.

20:18.049 --> 20:20.135
- You told me I was out, Dean.
- Yeah, well...

20:20.343 --> 20:23.847
And if this is gonna be the "guys like
us are never out" speech, save it.

20:25.473 --> 20:26.933
- Dean's right.
- Cass.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.060
There is no out. Only duty.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.437
Get the hell off of me.

20:30.603 --> 20:33.732
You are a prophet of the Lord,
always and forever.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.862
Until the day you cease to exist
and another prophet takes your place.

20:39.195 --> 20:43.491
Now, are you clear
as to the task before you?

20:47.454 --> 20:49.998
Then do it. We must go.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.443
What the hell, Crowley?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.323
Biting? Seriously?

21:47.639 --> 21:50.850
For the love of everything,
whoever is hearing this...

21:51.059 --> 21:56.898
...if anyone is hearing this,
this is your king.

21:57.106 --> 22:00.109
Send help immediately.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.710
- Anything? You were gone long enough.
- No.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.131
- There was one female but...
- What?

22:22.340 --> 22:24.717
I don't think she was female.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.721
- Anything here?
- Free drinks.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.808
Your buddy over there
thinks you saved his life.

22:38.314 --> 22:41.442
You really think it's wise
to be drinking on the job?

22:41.734 --> 22:44.028
What show you been watching?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.866
Talk to me. You sure about this?

22:49.492 --> 22:53.663
It's one thing, me and Sammy
slamming the gates to the pit, but you...

22:53.830 --> 22:57.709
...you're boarding up heaven,
then you're locking the door behind you.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.380
Yeah, I know.

23:04.299 --> 23:07.051
You did a lot damage up there, man.

23:07.510 --> 23:10.096
You think they're just gonna
let that slide?

23:10.263 --> 23:14.809
You mean, do I think they'll kill me?

23:15.518 --> 23:16.978
Yeah, they might.

23:18.938 --> 23:20.940
So this is it.

23:23.818 --> 23:25.445
E.T. goes home.

23:31.826 --> 23:33.703
Hey, there. Where's Ed?

23:34.329 --> 23:36.331
- Flu. I'm Gail.
- Well, okay then.

23:36.539 --> 23:38.249
Showtime.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.960
- Let me give you a hand.
- Oh, thanks.

23:42.211 --> 23:44.797
You're a real gentleman. Hey.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.343
This is like the first five minutes
of every porno I've ever seen.

23:48.551 --> 23:49.802
Thanks.

23:52.096 --> 23:53.264
Gail, Rod.

23:54.724 --> 23:58.561
- Ma'am.
- Rod rides a stool here most days.

24:01.272 --> 24:03.566
I'll be seeing you both.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.740
- Thanks for the help.
- No problem.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.498
Damn, that's sweet.

24:18.873 --> 24:25.129
Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things you say and do

24:25.338 --> 24:27.006
How about the next one's on me?

24:27.215 --> 24:33.054
Oh, it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way

24:35.848 --> 24:38.101
How we doing, moose?

24:38.309 --> 24:41.646
Ain't it about time
for the next love injection?

24:42.063 --> 24:45.233
Ch-ch-ch-changes

24:45.400 --> 24:49.821
Turn and face the strain
Ch-ch-changes

24:49.988 --> 24:52.448
Just gonna have to be a different man

24:52.615 --> 24:56.411
Time may change me
But I can trace...

25:14.012 --> 25:16.973
Did you really think
you could kidnap the king of hell...

25:17.140 --> 25:19.684
...and no one was gonna notice,
dumbnuts?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.399
Hello, boys.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.192
That's my line.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.279
Abaddon?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.990
- They told me you were dead.
- So not.

25:35.366 --> 25:38.995
- And the rest of the cavalry?
- Oh, no, it's just little old un-killable me.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.295
Brilliant. Why send in a few grunts
when you can send in a knight?

25:48.046 --> 25:49.505
Say your prayers, moose.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.054
That'll do.

25:56.262 --> 25:59.140
Undo these, I'll kill him myself.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.942
That was an order, was it?

26:11.861 --> 26:14.614
- I am your king.
- About that...

26:20.286 --> 26:22.288
- Hello, brother.
- Give us your bow.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.875
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

26:27.293 --> 26:29.670
Talk first, stab later.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.092
Know what I find most shocking...

26:34.258 --> 26:37.595
...about time-traveling through a closet
and landing in the year 2013?

26:40.014 --> 26:44.018
Somebody thought it was a good idea
to make you the king of hell.

26:45.686 --> 26:48.773
You know what that boy's
trying to do, right?

26:50.191 --> 26:52.944
He's trying to shut the gates of hell.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.962
Right now, you and I are gonna talk
about a regime change.

27:13.256 --> 27:16.551
You little whore. I am your kin...

27:28.187 --> 27:30.106
Love the suit.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.712
I've been afraid to go home
for some time now.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.716
Orders used to come once a day
and now it's chaos.

27:57.592 --> 28:00.344
It all seems to be breaking down.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.224
And you think you can fix that?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.810
With time, yes.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.818
Take it, then.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.616
You've been digging.

28:22.533 --> 28:24.994
Why are you doing this? This?

28:25.203 --> 28:28.539
Do you have any idea
what it would be like...

28:29.248 --> 28:32.168
...to be plucked from obscurity...

28:32.919 --> 28:35.796
...to sit at God's feet...

28:37.215 --> 28:39.675
...to be asked to write down his word?

28:43.012 --> 28:46.015
The ache I felt when he was gone?

28:47.808 --> 28:49.810
Telling myself...

28:50.645 --> 28:55.107
...Father's left, but look
what he's left us, paradise.

28:55.316 --> 28:59.737
But you and your archangels
couldn't leave well enough alone.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.659
You ran me from my home.

29:06.118 --> 29:10.289
Did you really think
you could do all of that to me...

29:10.998 --> 29:13.292
...and there'd be no payback?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.306
Ah.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.643
You did good back there, moose.

29:30.851 --> 29:32.895
I'll deny it if you ever quote me...

29:33.521 --> 29:36.274
...but, man, I'm proud of you.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.485
Thanks.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.862
Hold on. What's that?

29:42.071 --> 29:44.073
It's what it looks like.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.449
Are you joking?

29:46.284 --> 29:47.660
I just saved your life.

29:49.036 --> 29:51.580
- Seriously?
- Seriously? Me seriously?

29:51.789 --> 29:53.708
We just shared a foxhole, you and I.

29:53.916 --> 29:58.504
Beat back the Tet Offensive,
outran the Rape of Nanking. Together.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.549
And still you're gonna
do me like this? Aah!

30:07.096 --> 30:10.141
Band of Brothers? The Pacific?

30:10.349 --> 30:12.810
None of this means anything to you?

30:13.019 --> 30:18.733
All those motels, you never once
watched HBO? Not once? Girls?

30:21.152 --> 30:22.611
You're my Marnie, moose.

30:22.820 --> 30:27.783
And Hanna, she just needs to be loved,
she deserves it.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.203
Don't we all? You? Me?

30:31.412 --> 30:35.875
We deserve to be loved.
I deserve to be loved!

30:36.250 --> 30:37.918
I just wanna be loved.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.756
What?

30:42.089 --> 30:43.466
Huh?

31:01.108 --> 31:06.030
Would it be possible, moose?

31:09.867 --> 31:11.494
I'd like...

31:13.537 --> 31:16.457
...to ask you a favor...

31:17.666 --> 31:19.627
...Sam.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.339
Earlier, when...

31:24.465 --> 31:28.010
...you were confessing back there...

31:31.097 --> 31:32.932
...what did you say?

31:36.268 --> 31:38.938
I only ask...

31:39.438 --> 31:43.275
...because given my history...

31:45.569 --> 31:47.947
...it raises the question...

31:49.657 --> 31:54.078
...where do I start...

31:58.207 --> 32:00.376
...to even look...

32:02.670 --> 32:05.631
...for forgiveness?

32:05.798 --> 32:07.758
I mean...

32:08.467 --> 32:10.469
How about we start with this?

32:21.856 --> 32:23.566
I think I found the angel trials...

32:23.774 --> 32:27.820
...but I don't see anything about a Nephilim
or a Cupid's bow or anything like that.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.823
Oh, come on, Kev,
we're on the 1 yard line here.

32:31.031 --> 32:34.618
And I should have mentioned this six
months ago, but the sports metaphors?

32:34.827 --> 32:37.913
You wanna motivate me?
Magic cards, Skyrim, Aziz Ansari.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.082
What? Yeah, I don't know
what those words mean.

32:44.211 --> 32:45.880
I'm not here to fight you, Castiel.

32:46.046 --> 32:47.089
Dean?

32:47.256 --> 32:49.133
- Not anymore.
- Dean?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.384
Where is Metatron?

32:50.593 --> 32:53.095
He told you he was going to fix heaven,
didn't he?

32:53.846 --> 32:57.057
Murdering a Nephilim,
cutting off a Cupid's bow.

32:57.224 --> 33:01.020
It's a lie. All of it.
I've been in his head.

33:01.228 --> 33:03.022
You've been in all our heads.

33:03.230 --> 33:05.649
- That's the problem.
- No, Castiel. You're wrong.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.153
This is what you do.

33:09.361 --> 33:11.238
You twist things.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.365
I'm trying to fix heaven.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.701
Metatron is trying to fix heaven.

33:15.910 --> 33:19.580
Metatron isn't trying to fix anything,
he's trying to break it.

33:20.289 --> 33:23.417
- An act of revenge for driving him away.
- Break it how?

33:23.626 --> 33:27.463
- Dean.
- Expel all angels from heaven.

33:29.089 --> 33:30.841
Just as God cast out Lucifer.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.761
Cast you out? To where? Hell?

33:35.012 --> 33:36.597
Here.

33:36.972 --> 33:38.682
Thousands of us, walking the earth.

33:38.891 --> 33:40.935
- Lies.
- Wait.

33:43.020 --> 33:48.150
Our mission was to protect
what God created.

33:49.109 --> 33:50.778
I don't know when we forgot that.

33:54.698 --> 33:57.952
I want nothing more
than to see you shut the gates of hell...

33:58.869 --> 34:00.913
...but I told you that you could trust me.

34:01.956 --> 34:06.377
If Sam completes those trials,
he is going to die.

34:07.253 --> 34:10.672
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I saw it in Metatron's head.

34:11.422 --> 34:13.634
It was always God's intention.

34:14.176 --> 34:15.761
The ultimate sacrifice.

34:18.013 --> 34:22.976
As for you, Castiel,
I beg of you, stop this path.

34:23.185 --> 34:25.478
Metatron has been neutralized.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.482
If you want back in, truly...

34:29.190 --> 34:30.775
...I will listen.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.078
Hey, right now, talk to me.
Is she lying?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.205
- I don't know.
- Well, find out.

34:43.371 --> 34:45.040
- She's lying.
- Take me to him.

34:45.206 --> 34:46.625
- Dean.
- Take me to him now.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.232
Dean, I'm not wrong.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.734
I'm going to fix my home.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.612
Cass?

35:20.743 --> 35:22.453
Sammy, stop!

35:32.671 --> 35:35.591
She told you I lied, didn't she?

35:37.343 --> 35:39.219
You should've listened to the bitch.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.106
Easy there, okay?

35:51.690 --> 35:54.068
Just take it easy.
We got a slight change of plan.

35:54.234 --> 35:55.569
What?

35:56.278 --> 35:58.656
- What's going on? Where's Cass?
- Metatron lied.

35:59.323 --> 36:02.368
You finish this trial, you're dead, Sam.

36:08.415 --> 36:09.541
So?

36:12.628 --> 36:14.672
- You promised.
- Shh.

36:15.297 --> 36:21.929
Castiel, I want you to stop thinking
about master plans...

36:22.888 --> 36:26.392
...and heaven and angels, and of all this.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.227
That doesn't concern you anymore.

36:34.149 --> 36:37.152
These were never trials, Castiel...

36:37.319 --> 36:38.779
...this is a spell.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.199
What I'm taking from you now...

36:42.866 --> 36:47.371
...your essence, your grace,
is the last piece.

36:55.045 --> 36:59.299
And now something wonderful
is going to happen...

36:59.508 --> 37:02.636
...for me and for you.

37:03.262 --> 37:07.099
I want you to live this new life
to the fullest.

37:07.307 --> 37:10.352
Find a wife, make babies.

37:10.894 --> 37:13.981
And when you die,
and your soul comes to heaven...

37:14.523 --> 37:16.191
...find me...

37:16.775 --> 37:18.777
...and tell me your story.

37:19.653 --> 37:20.988
Hmm?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.115
Now go.

37:26.618 --> 37:28.829
Look at him. Look at him.

37:29.037 --> 37:30.456
Look how close we are.

37:31.123 --> 37:33.542
Other people will die
if I don't finish this.

37:33.751 --> 37:38.964
Think about it.
Think about what we know. Huh?

37:39.131 --> 37:44.470
Pulling souls from hell, curing demons,
hell, ganking a hellhound.

37:44.678 --> 37:48.182
We have enough knowledge on our side
to turn the tide here...

37:48.766 --> 37:50.768
...but I can't do it without you.

37:50.976 --> 37:52.561
You can barely do it with me.

37:53.061 --> 37:57.232
I mean, you think I screw up everything I
try. You think I need a chaperone, remember?

37:57.399 --> 38:00.736
- Come on, man, that's not what I meant.
- It's exactly what you meant.

38:02.654 --> 38:05.491
You wanna know
what I confessed in there?

38:05.699 --> 38:07.367
What my greatest sin was?

38:10.204 --> 38:12.956
It was how many times I'd let you down.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.960
- I can't do that again.
- Sam.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.798
What happens when you've decided
I can't be trusted again?

38:21.006 --> 38:23.801
Who are you gonna turn to next time
instead of me?

38:24.009 --> 38:26.595
Another angel? Another...?

38:27.221 --> 38:28.263
Another vampire?

38:30.098 --> 38:33.018
You have any idea what it feels like
to watch your brother...?

38:33.185 --> 38:34.228
Hold on. Hold on.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.190
You seriously think that?

38:38.690 --> 38:42.528
Because none of it, none of it, is true.

38:43.278 --> 38:46.073
Listen, man,
I know we've had our disagreements, okay?

38:46.281 --> 38:50.452
I know I've said some junk that
set you back on your heels, but, Sammy...

38:51.328 --> 38:52.371
...come on.

38:54.039 --> 38:55.958
I killed Benny to save you.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.001
I'm willing to let this bastard...

38:58.168 --> 39:03.215
...and all the sons of bitches that killed
Mom walk because of you. Don't you dare...

39:03.423 --> 39:08.387
...think that there is anything, past or
present, that I would put in front of you.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.223
It has never been like that. Ever.

39:11.431 --> 39:14.101
I need you to see that.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.978
I'm begging you.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.862
How do I stop?

39:27.614 --> 39:29.616
- Just let it go.
- I can't.

39:29.783 --> 39:32.160
It's in me.
You don't know what this feels like.

39:32.327 --> 39:33.871
Hey, listen to me.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.875
We will figure it out, okay?

39:38.083 --> 39:39.459
Just like we always do.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.297
Come on. Come on.

39:43.505 --> 39:45.382
You let it go, okay?

39:45.591 --> 39:47.384
Let it go, brother.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.639
Hey, hey, hey.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.019
See?

39:59.563 --> 40:01.857
- Aah!
- Sam?

40:02.065 --> 40:04.568
I got you, little brother,
you're gonna be just fine.

40:04.735 --> 40:07.112
Sam. Sam. Sam.

40:08.071 --> 40:10.699
Cass! Castiel!

40:11.742 --> 40:12.868
Where the hell are you?

40:45.525 --> 40:46.693
Sammy.

41:12.511 --> 41:13.929
No, Cass.

41:36.535 --> 41:37.786
What's happening?

41:44.084 --> 41:45.877
Angels.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.216
They're falling.
