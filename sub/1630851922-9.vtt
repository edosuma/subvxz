[Dustin] I'm already in the works

out with Dustin...</i>

03:20.401 --> 03:24.403

03:47.728 --> 03:49.027
- [Kayla] Hey.
- [Paul] Kayla.

03:49.029 --> 03:49.795
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.629
I'm glad to be back.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.632
Kayla's gonna be runnin'
your side and

03:53.634 --> 03:55.300
she has all the power I have.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.870
She's proven herself quite
a few times and she's

03:58.905 --> 03:59.705
tough and

04:00.807 --> 04:02.507
that's what we need
over there and

04:02.509 --> 04:04.810
Paul Richardson,
he's Wes' brother.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.812
[Wes] He got a bit more
skills though, pretty sure.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.879
[Scott] And you're fresh.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.881
They energy went out, didn't it?

04:09.883 --> 04:11.883
[Dustin] That's another thing
I'm hoping for.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.919
That's what
I'm hoping for as well,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.388
that some of that energy
rubs off on everybody else,

04:16.390 --> 04:19.524
- because you know how it feels to be here for a whole season.
- [Paul] Oh, [bleep] yeah.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.694
[Dustin] He's a really good
worker and, uh,

04:22.696 --> 04:25.430
I think he would be
a great addition to you team.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.766
[Paul] I know the creek,
I know what to expect.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.568
You know I'm ready
to get some gold.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.569
[Kayla] Nice, well,
that's really good news.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.804
'Cause, this late in
the season, like,

04:32.806 --> 04:34.406
we don't have the time to
start over training someone.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.041
- No.
- [Kayla] And

04:36.043 --> 04:38.076
having someone else experienced
is just going to make us stronger.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.411
[Scott] Yeah.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.812
- [Dustin] Welcome back to the crew, man.
- [Paul] Appreciate it.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.781
- [Dustin] And, uh, we gonna have some fun here.
- [Carlos] Yeah, man.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.384
- Let's get some work done, let's find some gold.
- [Paul] Let's get some gold.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.718
- [Scott] Yeah.
- [Paul] It's what it's about.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.053
[Dustin] And we'll have
some fun too.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.789
<i>[Paul] I love this
group of guys, I mean,</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:52.024
there was a couple years that,

04:52.026 --> 04:54.393
yeah, we had a little bit
of differences, but,

04:54.395 --> 04:55.927
we've worked through that and

04:55.929 --> 04:58.230
now we're back
to one big family again.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.332
Now, I feel better
with Paul there.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.700
And, uh,

05:01.767 --> 05:04.870
his presence is gonna help
them get down to the gold because

05:04.872 --> 05:08.006
of all the things he can fix
and the extra help.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.181
<i>[narrator] With their crew
back to full strength,</i>

05:16.582 --> 05:19.151
<i>Kayla sees an opportunity.</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:20.886
<i>[Kayla] In order to make
this season pay off,</i>

05:20.888 --> 05:22.854
we need to move
way more material.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.157
Um, and the only

05:25.625 --> 05:26.725
solution to that problem I see

05:26.727 --> 05:29.361
right now is to run
two dredges at a time.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.796
Um, that's gonna get us
to bedrock faster

05:30.798 --> 05:34.399
and hopefully get us way more
gold than what we're seeing right now.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.867
[Kayla] I'll talk to Dustin
and see what he says

05:35.869 --> 05:38.737
about letting' us using
the second dredge.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.405
- [Kayla] Hey, guys.
- [Dustin] Hey, how's it goin'?

05:40.407 --> 05:42.507
[Kayla] In all honesty,
we're way behind

05:42.509 --> 05:44.042
in how much gold we should have.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.711
So I was wondering if
it would be an option

05:45.713 --> 05:48.980
for you to leave the big
dredge behind because I think

05:48.982 --> 05:52.017
between the four of us, we'd
be able to operate two dredges.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.586
<i>[narrator] Last week,</i>

05:54.588 --> 05:57.255
<i>Dustin gave up on House Rock...</i>

05:58.458 --> 06:01.259
<i>[Dustin] I don't wanna waste
any more time digging here.</i>

06:01.261 --> 06:04.196
<i>[narrator] ...to focus all
their attention on the Chute.</i>

06:05.531 --> 06:07.766
[Dustin] This is what we've been
thinking about all weather long.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.936
<i>[narrator] A place they've
already proven has gold.</i>

06:10.938 --> 06:15.273
I need to know what's at the
bottom of that hole right there.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.310
Both dredges, huh?

06:19.078 --> 06:20.912
[Kayla] Yeah, it's gettiin'

06:20.914 --> 06:22.414
late in the season and

06:22.416 --> 06:23.949
since we're already on gold,

06:23.951 --> 06:26.551
to make it pay off
real big right now,

06:26.553 --> 06:27.619
we need to get to bedrock faster

06:27.621 --> 06:30.622
and I think if we have
two dredges going,

06:30.624 --> 06:33.125
two people diving and two
people up top at all times,

06:33.127 --> 06:34.159
then we can move
way more material.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.094
That's four people
to two dredges

06:36.096 --> 06:37.596
and it can be done,

06:37.598 --> 06:38.897
but that's not easy.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.733
- No, man, it's not easy, man.
- [James] Hard rotation.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.868
- [Kayla] Yeah, just...
- [Dustin] No.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.036
You guys are gonna be
running in circles.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.372
You think [bleep] fixing
a winch right now is hard.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.643
[Kayla] I think my crew
would be able to handle it

06:51.677 --> 06:52.944
with two dredges.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.781
I mean, I see your point about
wanting two dredges there, but,

06:55.783 --> 06:58.316
if we leave them both dredges,
what're we gonna do for a dredge?

06:58.951 --> 07:02.220
I've got a junkyard full
of old parts and pieces

07:02.222 --> 07:05.123
and I may be able
to put together a dredge.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.058
Junkyard dredge.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.493
Hm.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.061
[Wes] I think I can make
that happen.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.397
If not, you're gonna
be stuck with one dredge.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.399
- Sounds good, thanks.
- [Wes] Yeah.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.340
[Kayla] So, hopefully we can
have two divers in the water today.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.975
And we'll get it
cleaned out a lot faster.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.710
[Paul] Water's nice and low.
Golly.

07:25.712 --> 07:26.978
[Scott] Yeah.
I like this area.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.815
<i>[narrator] At House Rock,

07:33.687 --> 07:35.120
[Scott] This looks like
a really good spot.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.723
So our hole goes
from right up here

07:38.725 --> 07:41.660
- all the way to where that line is right there.
- [Scott] Yeah.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.862
[Kayla] And all the way
to the current.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.970
<i>with just four people.</i>

07:51.972 --> 07:55.006
It's a little bit challenging
running two dredges, uh,

07:55.008 --> 07:58.243
in an ideal situation, yeah, we
would have a tender for each dredge.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.615
<i>[narrator] To keep the operation
running, and the two divers alive,</i>

08:03.617 --> 08:06.017
<i>the two crew on the surface must</i>

<i>run comms to the diver,

08:09.556 --> 08:11.957
<i>unload baskets, clear tailing,</i>

<i>Failure to keep up

08:27.006 --> 08:29.274
I can't see us
running two dredges.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.977
Two people teams,

08:31.979 --> 08:32.544
that might be a little,

08:32.546 --> 08:33.578
little crazy.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.081
But you gotta be a little
crazy to get into this.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.317
I hope everything she decides
is the right decisions.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.187

give suggestions.

So far,

08:47.794 --> 08:49.594
working with Kayla,
and working with Stamper

08:49.596 --> 08:52.764
is gonna be a whole new

the dredge is ours.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.750
Now for the big question,
who's diving when?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.785
[Kayla] Well,
I'm diving today, um,

09:13.787 --> 09:15.787
if we can get to where
both dredges are running,

09:15.789 --> 09:18.123
then Stamper will be diving
with me as well.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.126
So, what's the game plan
with the comms?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.728
[Kayla] We gotta work on getting
a comm cable across the creek

09:23.730 --> 09:25.764
so, that way, we can link

09:25.766 --> 09:30.035
both divers together and we can
all use the same comms system.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.704
<i>[narrator] They can't
tandem dive without</i>

09:32.706 --> 09:34.806
<i>upgrading the vital comms system</i>

09:34.808 --> 09:37.208
<i>to connect the two divers
to each other</i>

09:37.510 --> 09:39.411
<i>and the tenders.</i>

09:39.413 --> 09:41.713
[Mark] Cut the end off,
wire 'em all back together,

09:41.715 --> 09:44.316
pull it straight across
and plug it in.

09:45.117 --> 09:48.153
So, we can have two dredges
operating at one time.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.024
My science teacher would
have been proud of that one.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.193
Look at that, perfect.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.429
[Scott] Alright, start it up.

10:02.702 --> 10:03.702
We'll get both dredges going,

10:03.704 --> 10:06.204
I got a feeling it's
gonna be really good.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.975
We're gonna blast through material
at a speed that's unbelievable.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.109
[Scott] There you go.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.983
[Kayla] I'm glad Paul came
and, uh, joined our team,

10:17.985 --> 10:22.821
we really needed a fourth person in order
to be able to run two divers at a time.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.855
[Scott] Double production,
double the gold.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.391
Two dredge, [bleep] yeah.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.762
<i>[narrator] So far,
with just one dredge,</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:32.831
<i>they've dug a hole 12 feet deep</i>

10:32.833 --> 10:35.700
<i>and hope they're
already halfway down</i>

10:35.702 --> 10:37.902
<i>to the massive payday
on bedrock.</i>

10:37.904 --> 10:39.170
[Kayla] Ready to go again?

10:40.606 --> 10:41.673
[Scott] You're clear to go.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.875
[Kayla] Their side went off too?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.710
- [Scott] They are cleared.
- [Kayla] Okay.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.278
[Scott]
Clear, good job.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.784
<i>[Kayla] Whoa,
this is really not good.</i>

10:52.786 --> 10:55.020
[Paul] What is it?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.222
<i>[Kayla] Oh, our hole's
[bleep] filled in.</i>

10:58.591 --> 11:00.158
What the [bleep]?

11:05.798 --> 11:09.200
- [Scott] What is it?
<i>- [Kayla] Oh, our hole's [bleep] filled in.</i>

11:10.936 --> 11:12.037
What the [bleep]?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.838
<i>[narrator] At House Rock,</i>

11:13.840 --> 11:17.676
<i>Kayla's crew has just
been dealt a massive blow.</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:18.576
<i>[Kayla] I'm standing.</i>

11:20.012 --> 11:23.048
<i>Where I'm at right now,
was 12 feet,</i>

11:23.050 --> 11:25.383
<i>and now we're only at five.</i>

11:25.918 --> 11:26.718
<i>[narrator] Last week...</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, that water's
comin' way up.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.723
[narrator] <i>...a violent flood
raged through McKinley Creek.</i>

11:31.725 --> 11:33.491
<i>[Kayla] Diver up, diver up.</i>

11:33.493 --> 11:35.760
<i>[narrator] Causing the miners
to evacuate.</i>

11:35.762 --> 11:37.495
[Kayla] We need to get
the [bleep] outta here.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.931
This is not divable water
right now.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.501
<i>[narrator] Abandoning their
gear in 12 foot deep gold stream.</i>

11:43.503 --> 11:44.936
[Scott] Think let's
just leave it.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.205
[Mark] Yeah, we gotta get
outta here man, this is crazy.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.009
<i>[Kayla] That kinda sucks because
we were on a roll finding chunky gold</i>

11:51.011 --> 11:53.311
<i>the past few days and now
we're gonna have to start all over.</i>

11:53.979 --> 11:55.980
<i>[Paul] Oh, that's not good.</i>

11:56.515 --> 12:01.252
[Mark] Man, McKinley Creek
strikes again.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.588
<i>[narrator] To get back
on the pay streak,</i>

12:03.590 --> 12:07.659
<i>Kayla's four-man crew must
successfully run two dredges</i>

12:07.661 --> 12:12.931
<i>if they are to move 7 feet
of fill-in in a matter of days.</i>

12:12.933 --> 12:15.734
[Scott] So, we got just loose
material that we just blast through,

12:15.736 --> 12:18.603
dredge through
real fast right there.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.171
[Paul] So, the majority
of it should be loose

12:20.173 --> 12:21.739
and we have to
dredge that stuff all out.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.409
<i>[Kayla] Yeah, we can definitely
do it, it'll be a bigger workload.</i>

12:24.411 --> 12:26.845
<i>But, I think if we're gonna
run both dredges,</i>

12:26.847 --> 12:27.946
<i>all of us can handle it.</i>

12:27.948 --> 12:29.147
<i>[Mark] I know we can.</i>

12:35.988 --> 12:37.222
[James] Come on, let's go.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.925
<i>[narrator] At Porcupine,</i>

12:40.927 --> 12:42.894
<i>Dustin and James

12:42.896 --> 12:44.662
<i>to build a third dredge</i>

12:44.664 --> 12:47.232
<i>and further expand
the operation.</i>

12:48.400 --> 12:51.069
[Dustin] This is where I keep
all my spare parts.

12:51.470 --> 12:55.073
Anything smashed,
bonked, broken.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.976
Gonna try to take some of this
stuff and put a dredge together.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.815
<i>[narrator] To build a dredge
from junkyard parts,</i>

13:03.817 --> 13:07.085
<i>they'll need motors,

13:07.087 --> 13:09.521
<i>sluice box, hose, floats,</i>

13:09.523 --> 13:14.592
<i>and heaters. It needs to be small
enough to fit in the narrow Chute,</i>

13:14.594 --> 13:18.897
<i>but powerful enough to supply a
diver with vital air and hot water</i>

13:18.899 --> 13:22.300
<i>and suction to get down
to bedrock gold.</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:29.107
Things we have
to do to get gold.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.143
- [James] Here's a sluice box.
- [Dustin] That's a sluice box right there, he could probably

13:32.145 --> 13:33.644
set it up, right?

13:33.646 --> 13:36.414
- [James] Yeah, and a jet log.
- [Dustin] Wanna bring both of these up--

13:36.416 --> 13:38.783
- [James] Look at that.
- [Dustin] Which one is the best one, then?

13:38.785 --> 13:41.986
- Obvious it's smashed, look at it.
- [James] Yeah.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.689
So, let's both of these
and he can decide,

13:44.691 --> 13:46.191
since he might get upset,
you know.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.194
[James] Oh, suction hose.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.031
Like a damn Slinky.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.170
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.040
We need to

14:03.042 --> 14:04.275
put together a dredge

14:05.444 --> 14:06.711
ASAP.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.047
And we'll go divin' and
we're gonna find some gold

14:09.049 --> 14:10.315
for me to clean that Chute out.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.349
Ready?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.251
[James] Let's get outta here.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.923
<i>[narrator] If Dustin can't build a
dredge out of these scavenged parts,</i>

14:18.925 --> 14:21.159
<i>Kayla's dream of double dredging</i>

14:21.161 --> 14:22.327
<i>will be short lived.</i>

14:34.039 --> 14:35.073
[Dustin] Almost everything.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.408
Missing one jet log.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.610
Do we have a jet log up here?

14:38.612 --> 14:39.711
[Wes] Yeah, we do.
We got it up here.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.013
- [Dustin] Well, there she is.
- [Wes] Yeah.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.115
- [Dustin] So, we got a full dredge now?
- [Wes] Yep.

14:45.751 --> 14:46.985
Need a gasket here.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.854
[Wes] This'll work fine because
it goes to the other hose.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.522
And I think I can get this
dredge together pretty fast.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.826
I mean, we've got-- we've run
out of time already, so,

14:54.828 --> 14:58.029
it's uh, it's not make-it-look-pretty-dredge
this time, it's just the

14:58.031 --> 14:59.731
"Slap it together
as fast as I can."

14:59.733 --> 15:02.133
As long as we can get it in and get
to dredging and get after this gold,

15:02.135 --> 15:03.968
that's the main thing right now.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.238
[Dustin] That's a full.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.108
No?

15:10.609 --> 15:12.076
What am I looking at wrong?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.245
- Am I missing a metal piece?
- [Wes] No.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.082
[Dustin] I just did that.
Just did that.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.117
[Wes] Well, that fits
right in there.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.385
- [Dustin] That's how that goes.
- [Wes] Yeah.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.419
[Dustin] Okay.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.956
[Dustin] I'm scrounging just
to get this going.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.926
I'm trying to optimize
everything. I think,

15:27.928 --> 15:29.694
gonna get all
three dredges runnin',

15:29.696 --> 15:31.029
two dredges with Kayla,

15:31.031 --> 15:33.164
and I get some crappy dredge

15:33.166 --> 15:34.399
put together for us,

15:35.234 --> 15:36.334
get into the Chute,

15:36.702 --> 15:38.102
find gold.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.906
[Dustin] See this?
This is smashed.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.976
So, let's put something on
it to keep it together, alright?

15:45.978 --> 15:48.980
The only hose we got
with holes in it.

15:49.715 --> 15:50.415
And this is

15:51.283 --> 15:52.850
straight from the junkyard.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.385
- [Carlos] Nah.
- [James] Yeah.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.021
[Carlos] This Chute
has to pay off.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.456
Seriously.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.294
Mother Nature herself built
the perfect sluice box.

16:04.930 --> 16:05.997
So.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.831
[James scoffs]

16:06.833 --> 16:08.666
But there's--

16:08.668 --> 16:09.901
God, I hope there's
gold in there.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.769
There's gold in there, brother.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.937
I guarantee you, man,
we're gonna do it.

16:12.939 --> 16:16.274
We'll find a record breaking
nugget, man. Talking about

16:17.776 --> 16:20.979
morning interviews
nugget find, you know?

16:22.948 --> 16:24.082
It's there, man.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.050
It's there.

16:28.687 --> 16:29.988
[James] All taped up.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.390
You'd be surprised
what tape does.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.797
The whole problem I'm having with
this dredge is, I'm gonna get out there,

16:39.799 --> 16:42.266
put everything together and
find out what's really wrong with it.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.135
Will the engine run?

16:44.803 --> 16:46.004
Will...

16:46.705 --> 16:49.173
the hot water heaters work?

16:49.241 --> 16:51.376
Will the floats float?

16:51.378 --> 16:55.279
Everything needs to do its job but
they've already been beaten to death by us.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.884
<i>[narrator] They'll have

<i>Until they get it assembled

<i>they have no way

17:09.963 --> 17:13.197
[Dustin] Well, I don't have any
damn gold and I need to find some.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.266
And the Chute has gold in it.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.503

19:42.748 --> 19:43.414
That's my foot.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.483
<i>[Scott] Any luck?</i>

19:46.785 --> 19:48.186
[Kayla] Hang on, I'm trying
to get Stamper.

19:49.888 --> 19:50.888
[Mark] Okay.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.190
<i>[Kayla] So, go that way.</i>

19:52.958 --> 19:54.959
- [Mark] This way?
- [Kayla] That way.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.028
<i>You gotta go that way
and take the hose.</i>

19:57.030 --> 19:58.062
[Mark] Yeah.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.997
Alright.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.202
- [Kayla] Go that way, go.
- [Mark] I don't know

20:04.204 --> 20:05.836
what the [bleep]
anybody's saying.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.205
[Kayla] Go.

20:09.341 --> 20:10.441
<i>[Scott] He's going
the wrong way.</i>

20:10.443 --> 20:11.842
<i>[Kayla] Oh, no,
I'm trying to tell him.</i>

20:11.844 --> 20:14.212
[Scott] He just pulled his
mask off, what the [bleep]?

20:14.214 --> 20:16.247
[Paul] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's goin' on?

20:16.515 --> 20:17.481
[bleep]

20:17.950 --> 20:20.618
I will never deal with that
[bleep] again.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.286
[Scott] Oh, [bleep] great.
Here we go.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.534
[Scott] Oh, [bleep] great.
Here we go.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.069

Hold on, slow down, slow down.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.117
[Mark] I can't hear anything.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.819
[Kayla] What's goin' on?

20:55.320 --> 20:57.221
[Scott] I think he's getting frustrated
about the fact that he can't communicate.

20:59.057 --> 20:59.857
[Paul] You good?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.092
Good deal.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.727
[Mark] Go ahead and do
what you gotta do.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.394
[Paul] Okay.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.098
[Kayla] Open it up.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.268
[Scott] Alright, Kayla, I am
opening the dredge back up.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.138
<i>[narrator] Stamper's

<i>and one diver.</i>

21:19.412 --> 21:21.779

being me, cussing, and

21:32.624 --> 21:34.525
that was that.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.661
<i>[Kayla] I mean, it sucks
I wanted to keep goin'.</i>

21:36.663 --> 21:38.763
<i>Hopefully we can get
that worked out.</i>

21:38.765 --> 21:41.265
Let's just see what we got.
Take a look at it.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.805
<i>[narrator] 1,000 feet

21:52.912 --> 21:54.912
<i>and have found no gold.</i>

22:03.423 --> 22:06.190
<i>functioning as a gold
catching dredge.</i>

22:06.192 --> 22:10.961
Right now, we are in a hurry to
get this dredge assembled today,

22:11.697 --> 22:12.697
get it runnin',

22:12.699 --> 22:14.632
we can't waste any more time,

22:14.634 --> 22:17.134
we have to-- we have to get
to the bottom of the Chute.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.940
Got a little bit of, uh,
construction to do here.

22:22.942 --> 22:27.345
So, the rest of our season is riding
on JD here and we gotta get him goin'.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.980
And hopefully everything
works right because

22:29.982 --> 22:33.017
pretty sure we left a large
amount of gold left in the Chute.

22:33.719 --> 22:34.719
<i>[Dustin] Wes is gonna make</i>

22:34.721 --> 22:38.289

<i>that's gonna last us for the
rest of the season hopefully.</i>

22:41.894 --> 22:45.096
I don't care what it looks
like, just need it to get me gold.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.034
[Dustin] Grab that end.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.969
- [Wes] Alright.
- [Dustin] Let's go.

22:51.971 --> 22:52.737
- [Wes] Got that other end?
- [Carlos] I got it.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.338
[James] Got it.

22:55.741 --> 22:58.175
- [Dustin] Alright, y'all got that?
- [Carlos] Yeah, I got this.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.077
- [James] Got it. So, that's it?
- [Carlos] I got it.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.312
[Dustin] Come on down.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.114
Flatten it out.

23:03.882 --> 23:04.949
Here you go, James.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.550
And one for Carlos.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.785
- [Carlos] Yeah.
- [Dustin] Grab that?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.420
- [Carlos] Got it.
- [Dustin] Thank you.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.421
Got it, got it, got it.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.057
[Dustin] Up.

23:14.659 --> 23:15.826
Alright, together, everyone.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.262
- Don't hurry it up.
- [James] Okay, got it.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.899
[Dustin] Hold on, hold on,
that side's jamming somehow.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.034
[Wes] Did anybody
ever bring that mallet?

23:24.036 --> 23:25.669
[Dustin] Junkyard dredge
in full effect,

23:25.671 --> 23:28.205
we about to find out
if it works.

23:29.474 --> 23:32.343
<i>[Dustin] Trying to give the other
crew as much advantage as I can.</i>

23:32.345 --> 23:35.479
<i>Without two dredges they
won't finish for the season.</i>

23:35.481 --> 23:39.417
But I have to have a dredge
because I can't go another season,

23:39.419 --> 23:41.652
without knowing what's
in the bottom of this Chute.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.422
If I gotta go take one of
my dredges from them, I will.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.633
[Kayla over radio]
<i>Working now?</i>

23:55.635 --> 23:58.502
[Paul] So, there could be a
lose connection, right in there.

23:58.504 --> 24:03.407
<i>[Kayla] You just gotta figure out at
this point what the [bleep] problem is.</i>

24:03.409 --> 24:06.710
<i>[narrator] Kayla's dream of
running two dredges is over,</i>

24:06.712 --> 24:10.748
<i>unless Paul Richardson, can
repair the vital comms system.</i>

24:10.750 --> 24:12.716
[Paul] That could be
the problem right there.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.718
So, splicing them together,
we [bleep] those wires up.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.288
If the diver can't hear
the tender,

24:17.290 --> 24:20.691
it's no good because if they get into
a situation, and we call for diver up,

24:20.693 --> 24:25.262
and they don't hear us, it
could get really bad really quick.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.399
That box has two outputs, we
could have just run from there.

24:28.401 --> 24:31.402
Over to here to run the second diver.
So, we have diver one and diver two.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.173
So, this should
take care of that problem.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.678
<i>[narrator] Thanks to
their newest crew member,</i>

24:40.680 --> 24:44.215

<i>[Scott over radio] Diver two,

<i>There's the hose.</i>

24:59.899 --> 25:02.166

<i>[Kayla] Stamper, focus on that side
of the hole and I'll do from here over.</i>

<i>[Mark] I know. Alright.</i>

25:30.663 --> 25:33.197
<i>Is there any material
coming out of the dredge?</i>

25:33.932 --> 25:35.366
Yeah, there's material
coming out.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.170
<i>[Mark] Nice little hole

<i>- [Mark] [bleep] Yeah.
- That's what I wanna hear.</i>

25:59.591 --> 26:02.293
Guys it looks like
a dredge again.

<i>it's the moment of truth.</i>

The only thing the dredge
has to provide is air,

26:15.875 --> 26:19.209
hot water and the means
to pick up gold.

26:19.778 --> 26:23.013
That's it. That is it.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.282
Alright! Let's crank it up.
Let's see if it works.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.818
I'm excited. Are you?

26:27.820 --> 26:30.955
Yeah, we're gonna bring JD
from sitting out in the junkyard

26:30.957 --> 26:34.091
to back to making money.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.360
Gotta choke
the hell out of it, man.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.369

Gas on, choke.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.839
Yeah, let's choke.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.042

They were very empty.

26:58.483 --> 27:00.284

Woo-wee!

27:21.706 --> 27:23.841
There it goes.

27:23.843 --> 27:27.544
This thing really wants to work,
guys. Look at that water flow.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.546
- [Carlos] That's a lot of water, dude.
- [all cheering]

27:29.548 --> 27:32.716

other crew, we got a dredge.

27:32.718 --> 27:35.919

JD is gonna find us some gold.

27:35.921 --> 27:39.456

- Yeah, that's [bleep].
- Yeah, that's a big piece.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.629
- Whoo! Whoo!
- [Kayla] We weren't even expecting to see gold today,

29:25.631 --> 29:28.899
because we were just trying
to clean out that flood material.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.201
- [Mark] See that piece right there?
- [Paul] Oh, yeah.

29:32.804 --> 29:35.205
Gold feels good.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.341
How's that for a welcome back?

29:37.408 --> 29:38.942

<i>[narrator] As they spent most of
their dive moving the flood infill.</i>

29:48.586 --> 29:50.287
[Kayla]
Not seeing pickers.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.790
The main goal today was
to open the hole back

29:52.792 --> 29:56.093
to where it was and mission
accomplished. We got all that [bleep]

29:56.095 --> 29:57.561
- out there.
- [Paul] Hey! That's a victory.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.464
I was thinking, when I
first saw it, I was like,

30:00.466 --> 30:03.901
"Oh, it might take two days to clear
to it out." But we got it done in one.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.537
-So, that's good. Back on track.
-And we got gold.

30:06.539 --> 30:09.072
[Kayla] I just really hope that Dustin
will let us keep that dredge over here.

30:09.074 --> 30:10.641
'Cause I feel that's gonna
be a game changer.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.409

30:14.712 --> 30:19.383
You know for such a bad start,
it turned into a really good day.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.586
I mean, anytime we put gold in
the box is always a good day so...

30:22.588 --> 30:26.356
I'm thoroughly impressed.
This is a good spot.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.526

good. They're on top of their game.

30:41.440 --> 30:45.642
and move more material.
We cleaned out the entire hole.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.847
All the flood debris is out of there. So,
now we can have a fresh start tomorrow

30:49.849 --> 30:51.982
and we're right back on track.

30:52.717 --> 30:54.384
[narrator]
<i>Up ahead...</i>

30:54.386 --> 30:56.820
I'm a bit nervous
to come back to the Chute.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.021
[Dustin]
Don't get hurt.

31:00.491 --> 31:01.925
[breathing heavily]

31:01.927 --> 31:04.094
<i>[Scott] Oh, dude.
Do you see that [bleep]?</i>

31:04.096 --> 31:05.996
[all shouting]
Run run!

31:05.998 --> 31:08.065
[Kayla]
Go, go, go...

31:08.733 --> 31:10.300
[Mark]
<i>Get out of there!</i>

31:17.108 --> 31:18.976
[Carlos]
<i>Today is a dive day.</i>

31:19.110 --> 31:21.011
And let's get to work.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.781
<i>[narrator] Dustin's dream of
a million dollar pay day,</i>

31:24.783 --> 31:28.986
<i>now relies on a dredge
cobbled together from scraps.</i>

31:28.988 --> 31:33.690
Huge day. Today is our first
dive in the Chute for the year.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.059
The rest of
the season starts today.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.261
- Alright ready?
- Let's go.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.130
Alright. Off you go.

31:40.132 --> 31:44.034
<i>[narrator] He's put his last dollar
into his biggest operation yet.</i>

31:44.036 --> 31:47.037
<i>And needs
to see a return in gold.</i>

31:48.539 --> 31:50.440
[Dustin]
<i>I need the focus up.</i>

31:50.442 --> 31:54.111
<i>Get to dredging, find some
gold so we we can pay for this.</i>

31:57.615 --> 32:01.218
We won't be able to come back
next year if we don't find enough gold.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.422
<i>[Carlos] Dive day one
on the Chute today.</i>

32:05.424 --> 32:09.760
We hope everything goes smooth.
We're working with the junkyard dredge.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.896
There's a lot of things that
can go wrong. Lot of things.

32:12.898 --> 32:14.231
[Dustin]
Fire it up.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.937
Open that valve over there.

32:19.939 --> 32:22.005
You see if it's got
air coming out?

32:22.807 --> 32:25.342
Oh, yeah. It's got air.

32:25.743 --> 32:29.279
<i>[Dustin] The junkyard dredge
is ready to go.</i>

32:29.281 --> 32:33.550
It is a patch up job. It is dangerous.
It wasn't ever meant to run.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.887
So, I'm taking a huge risk.
I'm not sure about it but

32:36.889 --> 32:40.090
if that's what we gotta do,
there are no other options.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.428
[Carlos]
<i>How's the hot water, hot?</i>

32:44.430 --> 32:48.732
Yeah! It's diveable. It's not
the best but it's not horrible.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.802
Huh! That will work. I guess.
That should work.

32:51.804 --> 32:55.205
<i>[narrator] James has
volunteered for the risky first dive,</i>

32:55.207 --> 32:58.809
<i>on a bush engineered dredge
that's never been tested.</i>

32:58.811 --> 33:03.747
Just dig as deep down as you can right here.
But don't go point down and hurt yourself.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.149
-[James] Got you.
-[Dustin] Alright. Ready for our best?

33:06.151 --> 33:09.786
- Yup.
- That's a lot of weight, dude.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.689
You're gonna need it.

33:12.691 --> 33:18.462
Little bit nervous to come back to
the Chute but gotta get the job done.

33:18.464 --> 33:22.733
I worry about rocks falling down and
junkyard dredge and Mother Nature,

33:22.735 --> 33:25.402
whatever she wants
to throw at me.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.405
So, I'd like to... get this
thing done and get outta here.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.742
I think you'd be safe if you
hug that wall.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.877
-[Dustin] Don't get hurt.
-[Carlos] Don't get hurt. Don't die.

33:33.879 --> 33:34.845
[Dustin] Don't die.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.279
Good.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.253
- [Dustin] Let's get him down.
- [Wes] All cleared.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.860
- Though we need to untie this, there you go.
- Hey, help me.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.262
I'm gonna let this go,
give you some slack.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.065
[Dustin] Diver in the water.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.001
<i>How you doing?
Go check air?</i>

33:58.569 --> 34:00.370
[James]
Got air, got hot water.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.306
- You got suction?
<i>- [James] Yeah, got good suction.</i>

34:10.281 --> 34:13.216
<i>[narrator] Dustin's junkyard
dredge works for now.</i>

34:13.218 --> 34:19.890
<i>But it needs to keep supplying vital
air and hot water for James to find gold.</i>

34:19.892 --> 34:24.127
<i>[Dustin] James's goal today is to start off
for a five foot hole all the way across.</i>

34:24.495 --> 34:28.065
<i>[narrator] The Chute is the
narrowest spot on McKinley Creek.</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:32.936
<i>They must dredge beneath the raging water,
to uncover a plunge pool in the bedrock.</i>

34:32.938 --> 34:35.405
<i>That they believe
contains a pile of gold.</i>

34:37.775 --> 34:39.776
So, let's get all this [bleep]

34:39.778 --> 34:42.079
all done, all those step downs.

34:46.350 --> 34:50.187
Right now, our total count
with gold is...

34:51.289 --> 34:53.457
<i>[James] I've a hard spot, the
water is pushing really hard.</i>

34:53.459 --> 34:57.360
<i>[Dustin] Love it. It looks like it's
beating you up right now even.</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:02.532
<i>[Dustin] All the rock here is looking
good. He's starting a good dig.</i>

35:02.534 --> 35:05.102
<i>We're already-- All the
baskets we're pulling out.</i>

35:05.104 --> 35:08.972
This place is uh... It's moving
so quickly. You have to be

35:08.974 --> 35:10.774
a heavy rock or gold...

35:10.776 --> 35:15.412
to stay in here.
So, this is where we wanna be.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.881
<i>[Carlos] So far James is
doing a good job.</i>

35:17.883 --> 35:20.584
He's getting a
lot of material out.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.619
Dredge is looking good.
Very cute.

35:22.621 --> 35:28.992
And the Chute right here is--
The gold is at the very, very bottom.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.395
So, anything that's on top
of that, has to come out.

35:32.397 --> 35:35.732
You're not gold,
you gotta come out.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.035
<i>[James] I think that basket,
I can't tell how full it is.</i>

35:39.403 --> 35:41.238
<i>[Dustin] Coming up.</i>

35:44.008 --> 35:48.145
This is probably the most
amazing dig we've ever done.

35:48.379 --> 35:52.415
And I hope, with all my person,

35:52.417 --> 35:56.419
<i>that this is the life changing
hole right here. That's what I want.</i>

35:56.421 --> 35:59.122
The amount of gold down
there that I hope is there.

36:02.627 --> 36:06.263
It could be life altering
in a huge way.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.932
Or it could be nothing.
[laughing]

36:08.934 --> 36:12.702
If it's [bleep] empty, I'll
[bleep] cry all the way home.

36:12.704 --> 36:17.207
[mimicking crying]
We don't have any gold.

36:23.347 --> 36:27.284
<i>[Paul] I'll get suited up,
then we can find some gold.</i>

36:27.286 --> 36:30.954
<i>[narrator] After their first
successful dive running two dredges,</i>

36:30.956 --> 36:35.292
<i>Kayla's now expecting every
crew member to pull double duty.</i>

36:36.561 --> 36:39.162
It's gonna be my first dive
for this season.

36:39.797 --> 36:43.466
I'm definitely looking forward
to it. It's... an amazing spot.

36:43.468 --> 36:47.337
<i>[narrator] At 12 feet and back
on virgin ground,</i>

36:47.339 --> 36:51.575
<i>Kayla's banking on two divers and
two dredges cutting in half the time</i>

36:51.577 --> 36:53.543
<i>it takes to get to bedrock gold.</i>

36:53.545 --> 36:56.813
<i>[Paul] The gold's coming up
so high up on top.</i>

36:56.815 --> 37:01.218
That's a really good sign this is a really
good spot. I mean it's set up perfect

37:01.220 --> 37:03.887
for a perfect gold
drop out so...

37:03.889 --> 37:06.990
<i>I've got real high hopes for
finding some pretty good gold today.</i>

37:06.992 --> 37:10.060
That's it.
Time to get in the water.

37:11.929 --> 37:15.999
Today is Paul's first dive on our crew,
I've heard that he's a really good diver

37:16.001 --> 37:19.102
and he knows what he's doing. So,
I'm excited to have him on our team.

37:19.104 --> 37:22.072
With him and Scott both in the water,
I think we'll get a lot moved today.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.273
[Mark] Fire it up.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.342
[engine starts]

37:26.677 --> 37:29.012
[Mark]
Alright, alright, alright.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.082
- [Kayla] Try it now.
- Oh, that's a lot better.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.017
Come on, let's go.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.989
[Paul]
Oh! It's cold water.

37:38.991 --> 37:41.391
Scott, get your ass down here
and get to work.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.693
I'm getting there.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.096
<i>[Kayla] Alright. Everything
is set up. You're good to go?</i>

37:46.098 --> 37:48.031
[Scott]
Good to go.

37:49.066 --> 37:51.968
Alright. Here we go!

37:53.437 --> 37:55.672
Man in the water.

37:55.674 --> 37:59.609
<i>[narrator] Kayla's plan, both
divers will follow the pay streak</i>

37:59.611 --> 38:02.679
<i>down the creek wall
to the bedrock bottom</i>

38:02.681 --> 38:06.049
<i>where they believe there
is a massive pile of gold.</i>

38:08.686 --> 38:12.822
There is a big ass rock.
Holy [bleep].

38:12.824 --> 38:16.159
How's the visibility down there? It
looks like you guys have good water.

38:16.161 --> 38:19.396
It's about two feet,
maybe two and a half.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.165
It's alright.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.101
I'm up for this kind of dredging.
I don't have to move anywhere.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.137
[Paul laughing]

38:27.738 --> 38:29.939
- This is Fred's kind of dredging.
- Yeah, right?

38:29.941 --> 38:33.943
Hey Paul, how you doing down
there? Everything going good?

38:33.945 --> 38:36.012
[Mark] Do you feel like you're
back at home?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.947
[Paul]
Oh [bleep] yeah.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.382
It's so nice to be back.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.686
<i>[Kayla] Having Paul here
is definitely gonna help us</i>

38:42.688 --> 38:44.854
<i>because we can move
more material</i>

<i>with two dredges running
and two divers at all times.</i>

38:47.491 --> 38:49.726

38:49.728 --> 38:51.661
[Scott] Hey, Paul, Paul! Come
here, come here, come here.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.064
- [Paul] What do you got?
- [Scott] Look right where my light's pointing.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.800
[Paul chuckles]
Oh, dude!

38:56.802 --> 38:59.369
- [Scott] You see it?
- [Paul] Yeah. [bleep]

38:59.970 --> 39:01.971
We have it.

39:04.408 --> 39:05.975
Nice little picker.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.311
Yeah. Yeah.

39:08.313 --> 39:11.981
- Did you find a picker?
- Yup. Yeah.

39:15.453 --> 39:18.888
I had high hopes for today 'cause
yesterday we already found pickers

39:18.890 --> 39:22.225

debris so, it should be a good day.

<i>Scott and Paul get into a

<i>- [Kayla] Basket is over the hole.
- Alright.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:47.117
<i>Wanna lower it down slowly?</i>

<i>[Kayla] Going down.</i>

40:01.899 --> 40:03.933
<i>- [Kayla] Ready to go up?

40:08.039 --> 40:10.006
Alright, going up.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.043
Alright there.
Now set it down slowly.

That's good.

Ah! He just wants
to go dredging.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.223
But I got pretty good
hole going.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.559
<i>[Dustin]
I think we're done.</i>

43:16.561 --> 43:19.329
Let's get him up for now.
Let's get him up.

43:20.497 --> 43:23.800
<i>[Carlos] Hey James,
we're gonna bring you up.</i>

43:23.802 --> 43:27.971
<i>- Your dive is finished.
- [James] Copy that.</i>

43:30.040 --> 43:33.409
<i>[James] I dug a hole
didn't I? Wow! [chuckles]</i>

43:36.647 --> 43:38.448
Alright.
[chuckles]

43:38.450 --> 43:41.784
- [Dustin] Good dive.
- [James] Yeah, I felt like I did a lot.

43:41.786 --> 43:44.520
- [Dustin] It looked like you did a lot.
- I got about four feet deep.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.789
Four feet alright.
I'll take that.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.025
You see me when I came up?
I had to go up a mountain.

43:49.027 --> 43:51.160
- [Dustin] Oh wow.
- [James] Yeah.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.563
[James]
First dive in the Chute.

43:53.565 --> 43:56.265
I pulled out a ton of material.

43:56.267 --> 44:01.671
I dug a hole in the roughest
spot that you can dig in so far.

44:01.673 --> 44:05.008
<i>[Wes] It's a great day. I mean, I'm
excited to be down here at the Chute again.</i>

44:05.010 --> 44:07.410
<i>Junkyard dredge's working good.</i>

44:07.412 --> 44:10.213
Winch is working good.
Heat is good.

44:10.247 --> 44:11.781
It's a great day.

44:11.783 --> 44:15.318
It'll be good when we have some
gold, it'll happen here pretty soon.

44:15.320 --> 44:19.956
Day one, beautiful,
complete, success.

44:19.958 --> 44:25.028
We're back at the Chute. The
Chute is what's gonna pay off.

44:25.030 --> 44:26.329
I guarantee it.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.298
<i>[narrator] After half a season
of setbacks,</i>

44:29.300 --> 44:33.436
<i>Dustin's crew is finally making
great progress at the Chute,</i>

44:33.438 --> 44:37.874
<i>the site he believes is the
holy grail in their hunt for gold.</i>

44:37.876 --> 44:41.577
You guys did great today. The
Chute will get done this year.

44:41.579 --> 44:43.179
We got to dig it.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.416
If no one's been down there,
we're all about to be rich.

44:55.492 --> 44:56.759
Good dive, man.

44:56.761 --> 44:59.429
<i>[narrator] At House Rock,
after a rockslide</i>

44:59.431 --> 45:02.065
<i>nearly took out their operation.</i>

45:02.067 --> 45:03.065
[Paul] That could have
been really bad.

45:03.067 --> 45:04.734
[Scott] Dude that's some crazy
rock slide there.

45:04.736 --> 45:07.804
<i>[narrator] The miners risk a
quick check in the sluice box.</i>

45:07.806 --> 45:09.305
[Kayla]
Turn that one all the way off.

45:16.747 --> 45:18.247
I see gold already.

45:18.682 --> 45:21.084
[Scott] Holy [bleep] y'all!

45:21.086 --> 45:24.554
[Kayla] Four pickers down there.
There's one there. It's all over.

45:24.556 --> 45:25.788
[Paul] Yeah.

45:25.790 --> 45:27.990
- [Kayla] That's nice.
- [Scott] It's in there.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.759
Look at all this up here still.

45:29.761 --> 45:31.461
You have to get the pickers out.

45:31.463 --> 45:33.830
[Kayla] That's a good
little pile right there.

45:33.832 --> 45:37.700
[Scott] We're killing it down
there too, dude. Look at that.

45:37.702 --> 45:39.936
[Kayla]
It's great. That's a good day.

45:39.938 --> 45:43.005
- [Paul] Good [bleep].
- [Scott] Yeah, it is.

45:43.007 --> 45:45.208
- [rocks clattering]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:46.944 --> 45:49.679
- Is that a rock?
- I think that's where they were coming down from.

45:49.681 --> 45:52.415
[Kayla] Over...

45:52.417 --> 45:55.685
[Paul] You can see where they
creamed everything on the way down.

45:55.687 --> 45:58.788
[Mark] I think y'all need to
go look at the other dredge.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.957
[Paul] Roll the dice and walk
to that side of the creek.

46:00.991 --> 46:03.092
Be careful.

46:04.628 --> 46:06.696
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- It's all over the back.

46:06.698 --> 46:08.965
- Oh! That's a big one.
- Holy [bleep] yeah!

46:08.967 --> 46:11.701
[Scott] That's [bleep]
exciting right there.

46:11.703 --> 46:13.736
I never saw that piece either.

46:13.738 --> 46:18.107
But the amount of gold that we just got
for the area that we actually dredged...

46:18.876 --> 46:23.412
That is some rich ground.
That is some very rich ground.

46:23.414 --> 46:25.615
<i>[narrator] Kayla's gutsy
decision to run two dredges</i>

46:25.617 --> 46:28.584
<i>with just four people
has paid off.</i>

46:28.586 --> 46:30.319
<i>[Paul] Kayla's doing a really
good job. She's more experienced</i>

46:30.321 --> 46:32.755
<i>than any of us on this dredging.</i>

46:32.757 --> 46:36.259
<i>[narrator] The dive may have been
cut short, but her plan is working.</i>

46:36.261 --> 46:38.494
<i>And they are on
the best gold yet.</i>

46:38.496 --> 46:41.597
I can't wait to see bedrock.
Bedrock's gonna be loaded.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.766
We find that bottom valley
or that right track--

46:43.768 --> 46:45.334
[Scott]
Dude, it's gonna be loaded.

46:45.336 --> 46:48.404
- We're gonna be pulling up nuggets bigger than that.
- I hope so.

46:48.406 --> 46:51.841
For me, coming in fresh and
seeing gold in the first dive is just...

46:51.843 --> 46:53.276
that's amazing.

46:53.278 --> 46:56.412
Running two dredges, we were just
able to move so much more material

46:56.414 --> 46:59.615
even in a shorter amount of time.
We don't know how deep bedrock is yet.

46:59.617 --> 47:04.153
We haven't hit bedrock at all so to be
finding gold like this, that's a good sign.

47:10.093 --> 47:13.129
<i>[narrator] On the next,
Gold Rush: White Water...</i>

47:13.131 --> 47:14.997
Right now, we're failing.

47:14.999 --> 47:18.067
[Dustin] No hot water.
Diver's got no hot water.

47:18.069 --> 47:20.203
[Carlos]
Fire, fire...

47:21.238 --> 47:23.039
[all cheering]

47:23.173 --> 47:25.308
Boom!

47:25.676 --> 47:27.009
Wow!

47:27.011 --> 47:29.412
[Mark] That's that shiny stuff.

47:30.514 --> 47:32.515
We have a hose
and it's so flimsy.

47:32.517 --> 47:33.916
That's all we can get
a hold off right now.

47:33.918 --> 47:36.352
We're gonna have
to take their hose. That's it.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.855
[James] Don't drop it,
whatever you do.

47:38.857 --> 47:41.390
What's the chances of me
falling and really hurting myself?

47:41.925 --> 47:43.159
Oh, holy [bleep]!

47:43.694 --> 47:45.061
Yeah, Dustin.

47:45.063 --> 47:46.462
[Kayla] That's not good.

47:46.464 --> 47:49.031
We've blown a lot of gold out.

47:49.033 --> 47:52.034
<i>[Dustin] I keep telling him to stop
digging down and he won't stop.</i>

47:52.036 --> 47:54.003
It fills the death trap.

47:54.104 --> 47:55.872
[all laughing]

47:55.874 --> 47:57.373
Oh, my [bleep]!

47:57.375 --> 47:59.308
We're back on the gold!
