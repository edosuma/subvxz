WEBVTT

00:01.789 --> 00:04.289
[Milo] So I opened the door to the
arboretum, and there they were!

00:04.372 --> 00:06.831
And I have no idea where
the orangutan came from.

00:06.914 --> 00:08.831
Yeah, I mean, how far is the nearest zoo?

00:08.914 --> 00:11.622
And why was he so set on
getting my pistachios?

00:11.706 --> 00:13.914
It's the mysteries that
make life worth living.

00:13.998 --> 00:16.872
At least that's what it says in
my expensive book of mysteries.

00:16.956 --> 00:20.998
All right, class. Today we are
starting on a new physics project.

00:21.081 --> 00:24.455
This will test everything you've
learned about gravity, inertia

00:24.539 --> 00:26.081
and weight distribution.

00:26.164 --> 00:30.330
All things I utilized in
making this beautiful desk.

00:30.414 --> 00:31.789
Solid oak.

00:31.872 --> 00:34.539
Took me the better part of 21 weeks.

00:34.622 --> 00:39.330
Weeks of solitude, just me, the wood.

00:42.164 --> 00:43.622
Mmm.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.372
[clears throat]

00:47.455 --> 00:49.872
[stammering] If you work hard,

00:49.956 --> 00:52.664
someday you too may own a special desk.

00:52.747 --> 00:54.580
Not this one, though. This one's mine.

00:54.664 --> 00:57.372
So, over the weekend,
you will be building a container,

00:57.455 --> 00:59.831
inside of which you will put an egg.

00:59.914 --> 01:02.831
Your grade will be based
on only one criteria.

01:02.914 --> 01:05.831
When dropped from the roof of the
school, will the egg break?

01:05.914 --> 01:08.914
An unbroken egg guarantees the team an A.

01:08.998 --> 01:12.039
All the others will be judged on how
well they have applied the concepts

01:12.123 --> 01:13.789
we've been talking about in class.

01:13.872 --> 01:16.455
Now, you will all be
breaking into teams of three.

01:18.831 --> 01:20.706
So, I guess you three
will be a team then?

01:21.998 --> 01:23.455
Cowards.

01:23.539 --> 01:26.372
Any limit on the number of eggs
we break while we're building it?

01:26.455 --> 01:27.914
No. Okay then.

01:27.998 --> 01:30.789
You sure you don't wanna join our
team, Melissa?

01:30.872 --> 01:32.622
I named it "Team Melissa."

01:32.706 --> 01:34.956
Not after you. Different Melissa.

01:35.039 --> 01:35.998
No, I'm good.

01:36.081 --> 01:38.706
Really? You're gonna
jeopardize those straight A's?

01:38.789 --> 01:41.248
You know, eggs can be rather fragile.

01:41.330 --> 01:44.664
Bring it on. I eat eggs for breakfast!

01:44.747 --> 01:46.206
Yeah, so do all of us.

01:48.872 --> 01:49.956
-[doorbell ringing]
-Milo?

01:50.039 --> 01:51.872
[Milo] Coming!

01:51.956 --> 01:54.706
I got eight dozen eggs.
That should last us...

01:56.039 --> 01:57.956
Like I said, I got four dozen eggs.

01:58.039 --> 01:59.164
[Melissa] Amateurs!

02:01.039 --> 02:02.789
Wow! That's a lot of eggs.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.455
I've got a grade point average to protect.

02:04.539 --> 02:08.330
You think that's maybe a
little bit overkill? [creaking]

02:13.039 --> 02:14.789
No, I do not think it is overkill.

02:14.914 --> 02:15.872
Touche.

02:15.956 --> 02:18.706
So, shall we get crackin'?

02:18.789 --> 02:20.164
-That's eggs-actly...
-No!

02:20.248 --> 02:22.039
No egg puns.

Aah!

03:38.998 --> 03:40.289
[bird squawks]

03:43.497 --> 03:45.914
Okay, guys,
we are going to crack this thing.

03:45.998 --> 03:48.539
And by that, I mean we are
not going to crack this thing.

03:48.622 --> 03:51.123
We have to build something that
can withstand a two-story drop,

03:51.206 --> 03:53.747
a wood door, a tree branch,
a size 8 and a half sneaker,

03:53.831 --> 03:55.414
-Zack's butt, a raccoon attack...
-[Zack] Hey...

03:55.497 --> 03:56.872
It's all in here.

03:56.956 --> 03:59.580
We have to build something that will
withstand not only one of these things,

03:59.664 --> 04:01.539
but all of them simultaneously.

04:01.622 --> 04:03.539
Well, you know what they say.

04:03.622 --> 04:05.914
Whatever breaks our egg only
helps our egg dropping contraption

04:05.998 --> 04:09.081
utilize the forces of gravity,
inertia and weight distribution better.

04:09.164 --> 04:11.123
-That's the spirit!
-Who says that?

04:11.206 --> 04:12.914
[squishing]

04:14.330 --> 04:18.081
Okay, team.
I give you version 87.3 dash 9.

04:18.164 --> 04:20.123
[Zack] I say we just call it "Big Bertha."

04:20.164 --> 04:22.622
I'm not naming them anymore.
I don't wanna get attached.

04:22.706 --> 04:24.123
-Come here, Diogee.
-[panting]

04:24.206 --> 04:25.206
Here it goes.

04:29.248 --> 04:31.497
Okay, looking good.

04:35.789 --> 04:37.372
-[grunts]
-Wait.

04:39.539 --> 04:41.123
Okay.

04:42.706 --> 04:44.123
-I think.
-[grunts]

04:45.330 --> 04:48.123
-Well?
-The egg is...

04:48.206 --> 04:49.497
Completely intact!

04:49.580 --> 04:51.123
-We did it!
-Whoo-hoo!

04:51.206 --> 04:53.706
I've gotta see this.
I'll be right down!

04:55.872 --> 04:58.123
Whoa, whoa, no!
You stay right there, Milo!

04:58.206 --> 05:00.455
We still have to get this
to class in one piece.

05:00.539 --> 05:02.206
I'll guard Big Bertha for the night.

05:02.289 --> 05:04.206
And Melissa,
you take home all the extra eggs.

05:04.289 --> 05:06.164
What extras? That was our last one.

05:06.248 --> 05:07.706
Really? Well, here, then.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.330
Triple-cooler it.

05:10.414 --> 05:11.622
And we'd better get out of here

-before anything else...

Hi, Mr. Murphy, we gotta go, bye!

05:21.998 --> 05:23.164
See you tomorrow, team!

05:23.248 --> 05:25.831
[Mr. Murphy] Milo,
be a dear and get your dad his crutches.

05:29.164 --> 05:31.330
[yawning]

05:31.414 --> 05:34.039
Okay, Big Bertha,
time to get you to schoo...

05:34.123 --> 05:35.164
[gasps]

05:35.831 --> 05:37.039
No!

05:37.123 --> 05:38.914
[gasps] Huh.

05:38.998 --> 05:40.123
Just a dream.

05:41.956 --> 05:45.206
All right. Time to rise and...
[gasps]

05:45.289 --> 05:46.414
No!

05:46.497 --> 05:49.414
[gasps] Oh, it's just a dream.

05:52.206 --> 05:53.206

05:53.289 --> 05:56.248
Well, that is peculiar.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.081

Yeah, that's more like it.

06:01.289 --> 06:02.664

06:02.747 --> 06:04.206
How's Big Bertha doing?

06:04.289 --> 06:05.497
Good so far. How's the egg?

06:05.580 --> 06:06.789
A-okay!

06:06.872 --> 06:09.123
Let's just get this
thing to the classroom.

06:09.206 --> 06:10.580
Three o'clock!

06:10.664 --> 06:12.039
[yells]

06:12.123 --> 06:13.164
Ten o'clock!

06:14.289 --> 06:16.539
Actual clock!

-He's already here, isn't he?
-How'd you guess?

06:18.747 --> 06:20.706
Hi, guys!

06:20.789 --> 06:23.330
Milo, I need to take the egg out.
Do you mind?

06:23.414 --> 06:25.580
No problem. I'll stand in the corner.

06:25.622 --> 06:27.497
I'm helping by not helping.

06:28.998 --> 06:31.081
Pilot egg is ready for drop-off.

06:31.164 --> 06:33.081
Whoo-hoo! Oops!

06:34.455 --> 06:37.372
-Heads up!
-[all screaming]

06:40.081 --> 06:42.747
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

06:42.831 --> 06:45.539
That was our last one.
Now we can't even compete!

06:45.622 --> 06:49.289
I am so sorry, Melissa.
I don't know what to say.

06:50.455 --> 06:53.123
Oh, wait a second. I forgot this one!

06:53.206 --> 06:55.622
Okay, class,
take your projects up to the roof

06:55.706 --> 06:59.289
while I monitor the drop zone.
[laughs]

06:59.372 --> 07:02.123
And send one of your team members
down with me for clean-up.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.914
I'll be on the ground crew.
Good luck, guys.

07:04.998 --> 07:07.580
And FYI, a tremendous
portion of my self-esteem

07:07.622 --> 07:09.455
is wrapped up in my grade point average,

07:09.539 --> 07:11.164
but, you know, no pressure.

07:11.248 --> 07:14.206
You know,
I made that pencil you're holding.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.414
[Milo] I think this is
taller than my tree house.

07:27.497 --> 07:29.123
Look, with all our trials and errors,

07:29.206 --> 07:31.289
this baby can now handle anything.

07:31.372 --> 07:32.998
Team One, you're up.

07:33.081 --> 07:35.872
Okay, let's go down the
check list one more time.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.330
[squishing]

07:37.414 --> 07:40.956
You need to take into
account acceleration speed!

07:41.039 --> 07:42.164
Parachute? Check.

07:42.248 --> 07:43.998
With 1.5 second deploy speed.

07:44.081 --> 07:46.289
-Shock absorbers?
-[squishing]

07:46.372 --> 07:50.330
Check. Compressed air plungers
braced by interior bendy straws.

07:50.414 --> 07:53.664
I cannot emphasize weight
distribution enough.

07:53.747 --> 07:56.164
Think of my desk! I know I am.

07:56.248 --> 07:57.706
-Roll cage?
-Check.

07:57.789 --> 08:00.164
Vacuum hose with closed foam core.

08:00.248 --> 08:02.539
And we have our first successful...

08:02.622 --> 08:04.998
Oh, uh, yeah, no.
Get the mop over here.

08:05.081 --> 08:06.622
We'll show you how it's done.

08:08.747 --> 08:10.206
[Mrs. Murawski] Oh. Very nice.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.539
Just a hairline fracture.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.330
Bradley's team is the one to beat.

08:15.414 --> 08:19.831
-Yeah! In your face, other people!
-I'm on your team.

08:19.914 --> 08:22.664
I hope it works.
I don't wanna let Melissa down.

08:22.706 --> 08:25.622
Come on. How much can happen
between here and the ground?

08:25.706 --> 08:29.164
Milo, Zack, Melissa.
You are the last ones to go!

08:31.455 --> 08:32.914
Come on, hold together.

08:38.747 --> 08:41.289
Okay. One, two...

08:41.372 --> 08:42.372

Yes, yes, yes...

Hey, is this the cafeteria
service entrance?

08:53.580 --> 08:55.831
No, no, no!

08:55.914 --> 08:57.372
Uh-oh! Kickball game!

09:45.539 --> 09:47.455
Seriously, can someone help me out?

09:47.539 --> 09:49.455
