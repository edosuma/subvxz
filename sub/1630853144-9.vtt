hello, bella.

11:26.069 --> 11:27.469
-Hi, dad.
-Hi.

11:28.004 --> 11:29.454
What a pretty dress.

11:30.140 --> 11:30.822
Thank you.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.775
Well, I'm starving. Shall we?

11:33.827 --> 11:34.626
Hm-hmm.

11:41.151 --> 11:42.834
So according to this person
that reached out,

11:42.969 --> 11:44.703
jenna used to work
at this farmer's market

11:44.805 --> 11:46.488
for a stand called
flint field farm,

11:46.573 --> 11:50.008
and she always talked
about getting off the grid
and actually moving there.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.543
Maybe that's where she is.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.061
And they're having
another farmer's market
in two days.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.245
I think that we should
check it out.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.585
What's wrong?
This is a lead, right?

12:00.687 --> 12:02.754
Yeah, probably
just another dead end.

12:04.241 --> 12:06.808
Plus, I mean, if jenna
doesn't want to see me,
what's the point?

12:06.893 --> 12:07.826
Look, you don't know that.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.362
You don't even know
if that was jenna
texting you.

12:12.215 --> 12:15.233
Look, I get
that you're exhausted,

12:16.236 --> 12:17.769

You don't approve?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.728
I'm just not sure
I trust her.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.596

of her relationship with dennis?

No.

in the past.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.053

14:15.555 --> 14:17.055
There are just so many women

14:17.157 --> 14:19.123
who need this center
and these services.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.676
And the fastest way
to get that done
is with public money.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.495

dyonte will think he was right

14:28.785 --> 14:31.252
Yeah, well, maybe dyonte
shouldn't be judging
your choices.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.959
You could always
just apologize to lucia.

you've clearly chosen

15:04.220 --> 15:06.404
we wanted to talk
face-to-face.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.508
We decided

You shouldn't be throwing

you'll always have

on my body,

28:10.005 --> 28:12.122
I just didn't want
to be seen by anyone.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.259
some of you might have seen that
I became internet famous today,

but not in the usual way,
like by singing a sea shanty

of a snow globe.

32:16.752 --> 32:19.870
No, I went viral
after being yelled at

32:19.988 --> 32:21.705
by an asshole
at one of my shows

32:21.807 --> 32:23.674
and saying,
"not today, satan.

32:24.926 --> 32:26.043
"not today.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.345
Not me!"

32:30.082 --> 32:33.350
what wasn't posted
was how he followed me
after the show,

32:34.153 --> 32:37.404
how he threw
30 ounces of soda in my face

32:37.489 --> 32:39.790
and called me
"a dumb ching-chong bitch."

32:42.594 --> 32:45.429
yeah, it's... Hard

32:47.116 --> 32:49.516

and ashamed,

32:50.602 --> 32:52.269
but I didn't tell anyone.

32:54.123 --> 32:56.573
I guess I thought
I'd be causing more trouble
for myself.

32:57.593 --> 33:01.128
But then I got to thinking,
why should I feel ashamed?

33:02.181 --> 33:03.780
Yeah, you know?

33:05.951 --> 33:07.951
I should be making
that asshole feel ashamed

33:08.103 --> 33:09.086
by telling everyone what he did,

33:09.204 --> 33:10.754
by speaking up!

33:10.872 --> 33:13.073
And I can't do that
if I'm silent.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.445

33:35.581 --> 33:37.247
I, uh, could've used
your support.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.816
Why couldn't you come?

33:41.270 --> 33:44.221
I didn't realize it was
in councilwoman hernandez's
district.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.405
Why does that matter?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.657
You don't work
for councilwoman hernandez.

33:48.761 --> 33:52.329
No, but she's a co-sponsor
of my proposal,

33:52.431 --> 33:54.765
and I'm already in danger
of losing her.

33:54.867 --> 33:58.101
And I can't just
show up at a protest
in her district. So.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.188
Right.
Because the optics aren't good.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.809
-Well, this is--
-politics.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.828

-Yes.

we don't strategize
in activism.

and support for each other.

but support you
and your rest campaign.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.791
Meanwhile, you've just
questioned all my choices
since I took this job.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.008

my integrity?

not you.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.663
Sometimes I wish
you just would've got
the dpn job

34:26.815 --> 34:28.682
so you wouldn't be
in the position
of having to choose sides.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.303
I chose this position
and this job.

34:33.421 --> 34:36.573
And fyi,
I did get the dpn job.

34:38.627 --> 34:39.876
What do you mean?

34:41.363 --> 34:43.230
Imani offered me
the position first,

34:43.365 --> 34:44.548
and I turned it down.

34:44.683 --> 34:48.201
So... Don't ever say
I'm not supportive of you.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.269
Why didn't you tell me?

34:49.354 --> 34:50.704
I didn't wanna
hurt your feelings.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.339
You didn't think
I can handle being
second choice.

34:52.407 --> 34:53.673
That's not supporting me.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.559
That's treating me like a child
with a fragile ego.

35:02.384 --> 35:03.617
You know, maybe
this isn't gonna work.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.073
Maybe you lean too heavily
on the women in your life.

35:10.909 --> 35:13.143
Tanya supported you
while you were an intern.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.377
And I wrote your grant.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.179
And five minutes after
you and tanya broke up,

35:16.265 --> 35:17.614
you asked me
to be your primary.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.150
If that's how you feel--

35:20.269 --> 35:22.586
how I feel
is unsupported by you.

35:22.721 --> 35:26.039
Especially when your solution
for all this is to break up.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.241
Maybe I do rely too much
on women.

35:30.012 --> 35:31.878
Maybe I need to be alone
for a while

35:31.964 --> 35:33.313
to figure my shit out.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.217
Yeah.
