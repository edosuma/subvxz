WEBVTT

00:24.190 --> 00:26.359
Motherfucker!

00:26.443 --> 00:28.028
-What? What is it?
-Take a look.

00:29.779 --> 00:30.864
Goddamnit!

00:33.908 --> 00:35.160
Motherfucker!

00:35.243 --> 00:36.369
We have to get back to work!

00:36.453 --> 00:38.288
Wait, are you okay to drive?

00:38.371 --> 00:39.456
-Yeah.
-You sure?

00:39.539 --> 00:42.292
Oh, yeah! Acts of foreign aggression
really sober me up!

01:00.477 --> 01:03.521
Perhaps I come in, and we finish this.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.525
Can't. Lots of math homework due tomorrow.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.278
Great, I'll help you.
It's gonna be like a study date.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.113
It's trig.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.158
We do trigonometry in grade six back home.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.327
Nerd.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.707
Anyway, my father wouldn't approve.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.042
Of study?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.752
Of you helping.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.462
He does it with me.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.672
Makes sure I struggle enough.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.009
It looks all lit up,
but no car in driveway.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.803
I don't think he's home.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.138
Maybe I should go in.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.765
Nah.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.894
He promised he'd do it with me.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.857
He's in there,
waiting to pounce 'cause I'm late.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.944
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.915
Dad?

02:09.671 --> 02:13.591
And what do you estimate
the velocities are?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.803
Yes. Understood.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.181
The solar panels are still close
to the Epsilon unit

02:20.265 --> 02:22.433
but on a slightly different trajectory.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.728
My guys are estimating
we have around ten hours

02:25.812 --> 02:28.314
before they're too far away to reattach.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.399
Ten hours? Easy.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.359
We're gonna <i>Apollo 13</i>
the shit out of this thing!

02:31.442 --> 02:32.652
Space Force spirit!

02:33.236 --> 02:34.904
Assess and inventory?

02:35.655 --> 02:38.575
The panel joints were snipped cleanly
in the open position.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.327
It'll provide power
if we can get it to touch Epsilon 6,

02:41.411 --> 02:42.620
and if we do nothing,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.165
it'll fall into atmosphere
and burn up by tomorrow morning.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.958
Okay, team, what do we think?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.631
I think we should try to get the panels
and reattach them.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.262
Good. That's a good suggestion. Good.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.015
Okay, team, what do we think?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.392
Suppose we leave the panels
on their trajectory

03:04.475 --> 03:08.396
and use Epsilon's adjustment thrusters
to bring the craft to the panels?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.607
-Interesting.
-Great. Done.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.484
And how are we powering the thrusters?

03:13.568 --> 03:15.778
Because the panels were the power source.

03:16.988 --> 03:17.947
Ah.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.366
The connection nubs are exposed.

03:20.450 --> 03:24.871
Microwave irradiation of the nubs
from the Alaska Microwave Telescope

03:24.954 --> 03:27.999
might generate enough
for thruster ignition.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.710
The craft will be above Alaska
in 15 minutes.

03:30.793 --> 03:31.961
Uh-huh.

03:32.045 --> 03:36.049
It's almost dinnertime in Alaska.
Are we sure that the nips will be exposed?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.219
Nubs, sir.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.054
I'm here.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.096
What's going on?

03:42.430 --> 03:45.558
Oh! This is a fun
sleepover kind of energy, huh?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.101
Get Alaska on the phone.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.311
-Yes, sir.
-No, don't bother.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.480
The panels are headed for the atmosphere.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.440
So... hurry, right?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.485
The nubs won't generate enough power
to change directions.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.694
Epsilon will burn up.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.655
Never mind. Stupid. Stupid!

03:59.322 --> 04:00.823
How did this guy get hired?

04:01.532 --> 04:04.953
I'm the foremost aeronautical
engineering theorist in Belgium.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.748
Oh, well, I didn't realize
that Belgium had a space force.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.668
Belgium is part
of the European Space Agency

04:11.751 --> 04:14.212
because Belgium is part of Europe.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.632
Great, 'cause there's nothing stronger
than a European Union.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.633
What's after Brexit?

04:18.716 --> 04:19.926
Frexit? Swexit?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.178
Shall we brainstorm?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.305
Yeah, let's do that.
Let's break up into teams.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.350
Anybody under the rank
of lieutenant general can take notes.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.894
And... anybody who's from Belgium.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.860
Would we ever get
to this flight equation?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
-This is the satellite.
-Right.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.990
This is what's come off of the satellite.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.658
Yes, if we enter this way...

04:43.741 --> 04:45.118
As long as the models match.

04:45.201 --> 04:49.539
Keep in mind that we don't have
any glasses or protractors in space.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.208
Would the thrust chamber
assembly cluster...

04:52.292 --> 04:55.128
La-la-la, listen.
Are you familiar with the sonic boom?

04:55.211 --> 04:56.713
Fresh out of the oven!

04:56.796 --> 04:57.964
Here you go. Cookies.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.717
Take one per person. One.
Careful, they're hot.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.218
Okay.

05:04.095 --> 05:07.098
"Manned space walk from the ISS."

05:07.181 --> 05:11.477
Hmm. That's risky,
and the ISS is 200 kilometers away.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.937
If we ask for outside help,

05:13.021 --> 05:16.274
the whole world will know
that the Chinese bufu'd our satellite.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.358
Next card.

05:17.775 --> 05:21.070
"Solar panels are like light sails.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.530
Push them back with light."

05:22.989 --> 05:25.158
Hmm. That's interesting, Yamato.

05:25.533 --> 05:30.079
It is, but how would we focus the sunlight
in the right direction?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.123
-Retask a LEOT.
-Next card!

05:32.206 --> 05:34.125
That's Low Earth Orbit Telescope.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.209
Next card, please!

05:35.293 --> 05:36.836
Yamato, there is something there.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.422
Why don't you take Swedberg and Carter

05:39.505 --> 05:41.341
and noodle it around a little bit?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.258
Good idea.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.053
Okay, what have we here?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.429
This says...

05:46.804 --> 05:47.805
"Bomb."

05:49.390 --> 05:52.518
-I don't know if that is a noun, a verb,

05:52.602 --> 05:55.313
or an adjective describing my outfit.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.565
All right,
let's not just dismiss that out of hand.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.691
What about a bomb?

05:58.775 --> 06:02.487
In my experience with the Air Force,
that was very often the right answer.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.238
Very, very often.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.949
Are we now pretending
we have tons of time?

06:07.033 --> 06:07.909
We don't!

06:07.992 --> 06:12.163
Okay, then who would like to elaborate
on their idea of "bomb"?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.171
All right, it was me!

06:20.922 --> 06:24.467
Maybe it's a small smart bomb,
very targeted.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.594
I don't see how that could help.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.722
All right, a big fuckin' bomb.
That was my first instinct, anyway.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.140
-That's no better.
-Shockwaves!

06:31.224 --> 06:33.059
-It's a vacuum.
-Space is a vacuum.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.770
Vandeveld, take Chan,
and work out the details.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.648
Noodle it around.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.624
I don't get it.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.501
I don't get it.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.294
"Tangent X"?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.339
Dad!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.675
Assess and inventory.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.971
What assets do we have
within a 100-mile radius of Epsilon?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.305
Four pieces of space junk

07:11.389 --> 07:15.768
consisting of three bags of garbage
from a 1990 shuttle mission and a Tesla.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.729
Also, there's something here

07:18.813 --> 07:21.858
that this computer only identifies
as "Mission X-12."

07:22.942 --> 07:24.902
I don't have the security clearance
to see what it is.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.654
Use my code. I'll type it in.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.780
Okay.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.086
Okay. It's open.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.005
Assess and inventory.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.759
This launched two months ago.
On board: assault rifles, ten.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.511
Assault rifles?

07:51.012 --> 07:55.433
This was not
a scientifically useful mission, guys.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.809
I kept it from you.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.854
It was a very successful mission,
ordered by POTUS himself,

07:59.937 --> 08:03.483
which proved that assault rifles
will work in the vacuum of space.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.734
Which was never in doubt.

08:04.817 --> 08:09.780
But now the Manchester Arms Company
can advertise the R-9

08:09.864 --> 08:12.617
as the official Space Force gun

08:12.700 --> 08:15.369
for committing mass shootings on the moon.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.996
Or hunting.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.290
Okay, okay, no politics, please!

08:19.373 --> 08:21.417
We all took an oath
to defend the Constitution,

08:21.501 --> 08:22.460
not a political party.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.253
We are all Americans here.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.422
Even Chan and Vanden-f-flank.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.799
-I'm an EU citizen.
-Canadian.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.135
Indian immigrant. On a green card.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.222
-Sri Lankan with an O-1 work visa.
-We don't have time for this!

08:34.805 --> 08:35.806
Keep going, Chan.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.602
Okay, also on board:
assorted tool package 2-A.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.437
Bags of chimp food, ten.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.939
Bags of dog food, ten.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.316
Chimp, adult male.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.235
Dog, adult male.

08:47.985 --> 08:52.114
I’m in charge of animal experimentation.
Why were there animals on board?

08:52.949 --> 08:54.450
Would you like to handle that?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.577
The White House felt very strongly

08:56.661 --> 09:00.373
that footage of a dogstronaut
and a chimpstronaut would be worthwhile

09:00.456 --> 09:02.041
and would be, um...

09:02.124 --> 09:02.959
what's the word?

09:03.042 --> 09:03.960
Viral.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.963
That reminds me,
someone release Fuck Tony from the brig.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.007
So the groundbreaking science
was not enough.

09:10.091 --> 09:14.178
We needed a literal dog and pony show,
recast with a chimp.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.096
Yes!

09:15.179 --> 09:18.307
But that is something
that we can work with.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.269
We have a manned flight
or man's best friend.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.271
We have personnel in the field.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.567
Yes, but we have the best personnel
here on the ground,

09:27.650 --> 09:30.486
and surely it is the people
who invented the bus,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.154
rather than the driver,

09:32.238 --> 09:34.615
who are the best people to fix it.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.493
You're talking to a pilot.
Remember who flies the plane.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.412
Most planes fly by autopilot.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.872
-Shut up, Chan.
-Well, most buses, too.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.917
Soon, everybody will be out of a job,
except scientists.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.880
I think Yamato's light sail team
are our best bet.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.216
Yeah, but I don't understand what that is.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.845
Warren Buffett always says
that he doesn't invest in tech

09:55.928 --> 09:57.388
because he doesn't understand it.

09:57.471 --> 10:01.267
Wait, look,
why do you distrust scientists?

10:01.350 --> 10:04.353
You scientists say
"don't eat carbs" one day,

10:04.437 --> 10:05.938
and "only eat carbs" the next!

10:06.022 --> 10:09.025
Because of the large sample sizes
and long time periods,

10:09.108 --> 10:11.152
dietary science
is by nature an imprecise sci--

10:11.235 --> 10:12.069
Shut up!

10:12.570 --> 10:13.863
I wanna talk to this chimp.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.906
Can we get a video conference going?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.493
Chan, does it say
who trained the dog and the chimp?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.329
Yes. I can have them brought in.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.664
General, I have to warn you.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.876
We've pretty much ignored these animals
for the last two weeks.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.920
It seems there was no provisions made
to bring them home, so we...

10:30.546 --> 10:31.672
ghosted them.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.007
You what?

10:33.424 --> 10:37.678
It's standard. The reentry capsules
are too expensive for animal missions.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.598
So, Laika, Gordie, Dezik,

10:40.681 --> 10:43.225
-Lisa, Albert II, Albert IV...
-Four.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.562
...were all left there
after the mission was accomplished,

10:46.646 --> 10:50.483
which, in this case,
was apparently obtaining cute footage.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.109
That's horrible.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.402
Not nice.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.654
Shame on us!

10:55.571 --> 10:56.989
I found some of the footage.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.297
That is cute, though.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.008
Ah. Mission accomplished.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.886
- Play it again.
-No time. Come on, Brad.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.186
I'm Marcus and Theodore's trainer.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.355
Ah. Uh, which one is the dog?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.398
Uh, Theodore.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.565
Well, first things first,

11:31.649 --> 11:34.360
which one would better suited
to fix something?

11:34.902 --> 11:36.904
Okay, well, probably Marcus.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.365
It's way more difficult
for a dog to handle a tool.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.575
What exactly are you expecting him to do?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.704
I want him to do a spacewalk
outside of the capsule,

11:44.787 --> 11:48.249
and weld two solar panels
back onto the Epsilon 6.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.084
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.628
It had better happen
because it is our best hope

11:52.712 --> 11:54.672
of salvaging a satellite worth billions.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.717
Our best hope are Yamato's light sails.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.386
Shh! Corporal,
what are the challenges here?

12:00.469 --> 12:03.013
Well, it takes quite a while
to train a new behavior,

12:03.097 --> 12:04.890
and this sounds like
a string of new behaviors.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
Uh, the experiment ended
at least ten days ago,

12:07.852 --> 12:10.146
so I don't know what treats are left
to reinforce him with.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.357
What about duty?
Is that not enough of a treat anymore?

12:14.108 --> 12:15.151
Look, I'll do my best.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.738
And I will try to impress upon him
the importance of this new mission.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.950
All right,
so how do you communicate with...

12:23.033 --> 12:24.201
What? Marcus is it?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.078
Uh... sign language.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.456
You do realize this is a chimpanzee?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.874
Yes. Yes, of course.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.084
A Space Force chimpanzee named Marcus.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.838
All right, get him up on the screen.
We do not have much time.

12:37.923 --> 12:38.841
Marcus!

12:40.634 --> 12:41.635
Marcus?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.472
Here, Marcus!

12:44.972 --> 12:46.140
-Up here.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.314
What is he doing? Is he signing something?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.065
Yes. He's saying "baby monkey."

12:56.192 --> 12:58.527
Oh. Jesus, he misses his children.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.823
No. In nature, chimps eat baby monkeys
whenever they can their hands on them.

13:02.907 --> 13:03.824
Google it.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.578
Probably just sick of
his regular chimp food.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.079
Oh, my word.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.875
This is absolutely disgusting. Look.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.169
-Yeah, they eat human babies, too.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.339
-Look that up.
-Stop. Stop. It's a wild animal.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.381
Oh, my God!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.133
He has a different morality,

13:21.217 --> 13:24.512
and NASA was riddled with ex-Nazis,

13:24.595 --> 13:28.516
so... who are we to cast stones?
All right.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.895
Tell Marcus we will get him baby monkey.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.273
But first, he has to do something for us.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.775
Something for his country.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
We're not going to give him baby monkey.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.487
Of course we're not, Dr. Wolf,

13:41.570 --> 13:44.907
but sometimes you have to lie to people
in order to motivate them.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.368
Like your promotion or your sabbatical.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.744
-What?
-Tell him!

13:49.203 --> 13:52.706
We know Marcus want treat.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.459
But first, Marcus go outside.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.713
"Go outside, die."

13:59.797 --> 14:01.757
No die. Helmet.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.718
He can put on his helmet.
That's one of his behaviors.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.596
Also, his helmet has a laser
that we can activate,

14:07.680 --> 14:12.101
and when it shines on something,
Marcus will try to manipulate that thing.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.356
"Bored. Hungry. Horny."

14:17.731 --> 14:20.276
Tell him, "I know bored.

14:20.901 --> 14:21.986
Sorry hungry.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.071
Horny bad.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.032
Space Force good.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.617
Help Space Force.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.119
Get banana."

14:33.747 --> 14:36.166
"No smell banana. Where banana?"

14:37.001 --> 14:38.210
Banana there.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.962
Special banana.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.755
Frozen banana.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.341
Mmm! Banana.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.719
Why are we doing this?

14:47.386 --> 14:50.055
Open the cage.
Let him come out and put on his helmet.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.728
If we can get the helmet on
and the camera turned on,

14:55.811 --> 14:58.439
and if he looks at the right tool
on the tool wall,

14:58.522 --> 15:00.357
I think I can get him to pick it up.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.942
But those are big ifs.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.696
He's doing it.
Look at that, look at that.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.323
There he goes. There he goes!

15:09.450 --> 15:13.078
There! There, he-- Look at-- He did it!
He did it. He's ready for his spacewalk.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.956
Goddamnit, I love this fucking chimp!

15:16.373 --> 15:17.207
Okay.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.542
There's the tool wall.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.961
What do you think
the best tool would be for the job?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.213
Probably the cordless drill.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.050
Tell him, "Pick up the cordless drill."

15:26.133 --> 15:29.261
That's not how it works.
We have to wait till he looks at it.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.221
How much time left, Chan?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.973
Six hours, 18 minutes.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.017
Okay, I'm gonna
check on Yamato's team.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.102
You keep playing with Murderous George.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.855
Get the-- Get it! Get the drill!

15:39.939 --> 15:44.151
<i>The half-angle identity</i>
<i>of a tangent is normally written as</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:46.987
<i>-tangent alpha over two...</i>

15:47.071 --> 15:52.159
<i>...equals sine alpha</i>
<i>over one plus cosine Alpha...</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:53.827
Grandpa?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.371
<i> Oh, you're back.</i>

15:55.829 --> 15:57.623
-How was Mexico?

15:57.706 --> 16:00.292
Hey, did those kidnappers
get the money I wired them?

16:00.793 --> 16:05.589
Oh, Grandpa, you have got to stop
wiring money to scammers.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.132
I had no choice.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.802
They were gonna sell you
to a brothel in Guadalajara.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.720
<i>That's no life for a young lady.</i>

16:11.804 --> 16:12.846
Okay.

16:12.930 --> 16:17.351
I'm gonna send you an article
from the AARP about Internet scams, okay?

16:17.768 --> 16:19.144
I won't even open it.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.690
Never clink on a link
with the word "scam" in it, honey.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.275
There's too many con artists out there.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.153
Wait, what-- what time is it there?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.905
Oh, jeez, I don't know.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.865
My heart beats so slow lately.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.492
I don't even really sleep.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.328
Do you know anything about trig?

16:36.704 --> 16:39.456
Trig? Yeah.
That was the name of Roy Rogers' horse.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.542
Why, you doing a crossword?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.088
Oh, no. Oh, God. Here we go.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.590
Uh, Erin, I'll talk to you later.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.634
<i>There's something going down over here.</i>

16:50.968 --> 16:52.678
-Your grandma needs me.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.264
Uh, I gotta adjust that machine of hers.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.932
I've been giving her too much air.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.560
Okay. Love you.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.105
<i>Love you, too. Just get that money</i>
<i>back to me whenever you can.</i>

17:06.817 --> 17:07.651
There!

17:07.735 --> 17:09.528
Oh, shit.<i> </i>He swung past again.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.322
I think he is slowing down, though.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.867
-Two hours left.
<i>-</i>I know that, Chan. Thank you.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.660
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Press the laser.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.204
Oh, no, he just turned away.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.333
Oh, cr-- No. Okay. There he goes!
He's looking at it again! Right now!

17:23.417 --> 17:24.918
No, missed it.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.420
Okay. That...

17:26.879 --> 17:28.088
Go! Now go! He's there.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.257
Go! Press it!

17:32.384 --> 17:33.886
-Yes! He did it!

17:33.969 --> 17:35.012
All right!

17:35.095 --> 17:36.555
Okay, now we're talking.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.017
Okay. Good. Good. Finally, he's doing it.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.811
Tell Marcus to go to the airlock.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.855
It is time for our spacewalk.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.356
Should I tell Dr. Mallory?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.693
Let's surprise him
with a successful mission.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.029
Aw, you're killing it, boss man!

17:52.112 --> 17:53.447
What are you doing here?

17:53.530 --> 17:54.823
Well, I saw history being made.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.034
I couldn't resist being a part of it.
So, up top.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
I fired you 17 hours ago.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.831
Yeah, you know what? In my experience,
there's "fired," and then there's fired.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.708
This one felt more like
a "fired" type thing.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.419
But if I'm fired, I'm fired. I get it.
Don't even think about it now.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.422
You're busy.  I'm not even here.
You're crushing it.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.927
You can do it, Marcus.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.307
- Yeah!

18:22.976 --> 18:24.061
Holy shit.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.688
He's got the chimp out of the capsule.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.152
- Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.904
There we go. Yeah.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.114
All right. Good.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.368
Dr. Mallory, just in time
to see a Space Force hero

18:39.451 --> 18:40.452
kicking ass at the scene.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.414
So, how fast is he approaching Epsilon?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.125
Two miles an hour in relative speed.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.210
He should be able to grab the fin
and use the drill

18:48.293 --> 18:50.629
to connect the panel
onto the body of the craft.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.549
-We can take over from there.
-Marcus! You're doing great.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.843
You see that fin?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.886
That is where you grab on.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.638
Grab fin. Grab fin.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.355
Now grab the drill!

19:09.398 --> 19:10.482
Pick up drill!

19:12.734 --> 19:15.028
Both! Pick up both! Fin and the drill.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.613
Grab fin. Grab fin.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.407
Also drill. No!

19:18.490 --> 19:20.659
Both fin and drill. Fin and drill.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.078
-All right. No. Don't...

19:23.162 --> 19:24.454
-What is he... No.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.874
Marcus, don't hit that. Bad Marcus.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.083
-Don't do that.
-Whoa.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.001
No!

19:29.418 --> 19:31.211
-Wait, he can't bend that.
-All right, no, no, no!

19:31.295 --> 19:32.754
No, no, no. That's very valuable.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.965
-Don't smash. What are you telling him?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.633
Marcus, no smash!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.427
-What is he doing?
-He's frustrated.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.469
<i>He's </i>frustrated?

19:39.553 --> 19:41.430
You tell him
that I've been up for 24 hours,

19:41.513 --> 19:43.056
and my career is at stake!

19:43.140 --> 19:45.642
There's really no word for "career"
in primate sign language,

19:45.726 --> 19:48.061
so I'll just say, "Food-work in danger."

19:49.938 --> 19:50.898
Wait.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.482
Wait.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.026
He's doing it!

19:54.109 --> 19:55.235
Drill, Marcus!

19:55.777 --> 19:57.321
Drill for banana.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.073
Drill for the general's food-work.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.075
- Look, the lights.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.001
There we go! All right. All right.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.339
Wait! Hold off. Have him hold off.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.506
Wait. Marcus, stop!

20:20.093 --> 20:21.220
Oh!

20:21.303 --> 20:22.888
Whoa, whoa. Shouldn't he let go?

20:22.971 --> 20:24.973
-Or should he hold-- What? What should--
-I don't--

20:25.057 --> 20:27.059
Is he supposed to let go or hold on?
Get him to let go of it!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.393
Tell him to release the drill!

20:28.477 --> 20:31.063
-Tell him to release!
-Release, Marcus. Release! Release!

20:32.439 --> 20:33.982
<i>Hoo-hoo...</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:36.360
Oh! Damn it!

20:36.443 --> 20:38.904
Oh, mother of God.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.784
What happened to the tether?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.702
Snapped, it looks like.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.954
Oh, damn it.

20:47.037 --> 20:51.875
He's heading on a trajectory
to intercept the sun sometime next week.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.711
Oh, fuck me!

20:57.130 --> 20:59.091
Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus...

20:59.841 --> 21:02.427
Oh, you did not deserve that, Marcus.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.137
You tried so hard.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.555
Oh, God.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.724
-Brad.
-Yes, sir?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.810
See to it that he is awarded

21:09.893 --> 21:12.562
the highest service medal
that he is eligible for.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.524
Well, he's not eligible for anything
because he's an animal.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.110
He is not an animal! He is a spaceman!

21:18.193 --> 21:20.028
And no spaceman gets left behind.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.530
Even one that eats babies.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.782
And how is that different than veal?

21:25.492 --> 21:27.869
How much will it cost
to go up and rescue him?

21:27.953 --> 21:28.912
You know what? No.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.789
No! I don't even wanna know!

21:30.872 --> 21:33.709
-'Cause we are doing it.
-It's about 50 to 400 million dollars.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.503
Bleh. Okay, well, he was gonna die anyway.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.671
No! No!

21:37.754 --> 21:39.089
We are bringing him home!

21:39.589 --> 21:41.383
-Can he still hear us?
-Probably.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.218
Marcus...

21:44.344 --> 21:45.721
...this is General Naird.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.432
Thank you, Marcus.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.896
It is very difficult for an officer
to send a spaceman into harm's way.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.897
<i>Hoo...</i>

21:56.315 --> 21:58.483
And this...

21:59.526 --> 22:00.986
did not go as planned.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.529
Clearly.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.489
Long story short,

22:05.449 --> 22:08.535
you are going to be
hurtling towards the sun for about a week,

22:08.618 --> 22:14.624
but then... a giant metal space friend
will come and rescue you, Marcus.

22:17.836 --> 22:18.712
Yes.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.049
Yes, Marcus.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.052
Hoo-hoo.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.263
<i>Hoo... hoo.</i>

22:31.391 --> 22:36.313
We are awarding you the Two Star Rampant
of the Space Force Ultimate Service Medal.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.984
Marcus, God bless you.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.112
You represent the best in all of us.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.907
I knew that chimp.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.242
I managed his Facebook page.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.078
I follow him, yeah.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.372
<i>Hoo...</i>

22:54.456 --> 22:55.290
All right!

22:55.874 --> 22:57.667
Let's try Theodore.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.463
-Who?
-The dog.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.591
The husky. Let's see
if he can hold the drill in his mouth.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.520
What is that?

23:18.438 --> 23:21.525
I believe that Marcus,
at some point in the last two weeks,

23:21.608 --> 23:24.444
must have eaten Theodore.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.739
Seriously?

23:28.824 --> 23:31.076
Well, that sucks.

23:31.159 --> 23:34.329
And I just said
he represents the best in all of us.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.414
Take that back!

23:35.497 --> 23:37.958
Brad, no medal for that asshole.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.627
The dog is eaten. Oh, my God.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.753
He ate the dog.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.632
Theodore is the real hero here,
not that fuckin' monkey!

23:46.508 --> 23:47.926
How much time do we have left?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.053
Looks like 11 minutes.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.681
Eleven minutes.
All right, let's try Yamato's idea.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.266
That won't work now.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.767
Don't be a sore loser, Adrian.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.978
-Just try it!
-No, it's impossible.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.356
His idea was to gently push

24:01.815 --> 24:04.234
the panels back toward the craft,

24:04.317 --> 24:07.904
but now your chimp
has flung them way past the craft,

24:07.988 --> 24:09.948
so we would have to pull them back,

24:10.031 --> 24:13.410
and there's nothing
we can transmit from Earth

24:13.493 --> 24:14.828
that will pull anything.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.163
Are you sure?

24:16.246 --> 24:17.289
Yes, quite.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.709
I wish we had a tractor beam
like in <i>Star Trek.</i>

24:20.792 --> 24:23.253
-Well, we don't have--
-I know that.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.130
'Cause they don't exist.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.673
Yes, yes, yes.

24:30.051 --> 24:30.969
Whose is that?

24:31.052 --> 24:33.388
Switch to Marcus's helmet cam.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.394
The Chinese.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.772
They've made a full orbit.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.107
Those assholes.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.739
Oh, no, no, no, Marcus.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.032
No.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.116
Marcus!

24:53.700 --> 24:55.744
Mar-- No. Resist, Marcus.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.621
Do not go willingly.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.248
Remember the military code, Marcus.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.126
No!
You will resist the enemy at all costs.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.045
Marcus, don't...

25:06.046 --> 25:08.131
Do not go with them!
Marcus, they are the--

25:08.673 --> 25:09.841
You're not doing it.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.301
You!

25:12.093 --> 25:13.220
Dog-eating bastard!

25:17.015 --> 25:18.266
Uh...

25:21.311 --> 25:22.771
Sec Def is on the phone.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.651
I'll take it in my office.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.744
Hello.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.455
<i>So, I understand</i>
<i>something is wrong with the Epsilon.</i>

25:41.706 --> 25:44.793
Yes,
I took over the rescue efforts personally,

25:44.876 --> 25:46.795
and it all pretty much went sideways.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.132
We've got a chimpstronaut
in Chinese hands.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.761
I take full responsibility.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.597
<i>Did anyone try to bomb anything?</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:02.477
I was talked out of it
by the science team.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.065
I will tender my resignation to POTUS.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.860
I<i> think you're being</i>
<i>a little hard on yourself. Get some rest.</i>

26:10.944 --> 26:13.822
<i>Sounds like you've been awake</i>
<i>and working for two days straight.</i>

26:20.245 --> 26:21.288
Thank you, sir.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.630
Hey, thanks for the pineapple, sir.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.090
-I got it last night.
-Hmm?

26:32.507 --> 26:33.466
Oh.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.135
Jesus, it feels like a week ago.

26:37.804 --> 26:41.308
Well, I really screwed up tonight,
spaceman.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.226
We all make mistakes, sir.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.186
Did anybody die?

26:46.855 --> 26:47.772
Theodore.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.233
The dogstronaut.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.193
-"The dog..."
-He was a good boy.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.446
So cute, and he could catch.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.911
It's our first Space Force casualty.
It's just sort of weighing on me.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.206
Yeah, um, how did it happen?

27:06.374 --> 27:08.084
He was eaten by a crewmate.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.337
A chimpstronaut...

27:11.046 --> 27:13.548
who is now a POW in a Chinese satellite.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.681
You have a difficult job, sir.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.313
That chimp better keep
his fuckin' mouth shut.

27:51.002 --> 27:51.920
Hey.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.380
Bug.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.258
Oh, hey.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.344
Hey. How'd the homework go?

28:00.428 --> 28:01.262
Not good.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.808
There was some stuff
I didn't understand, so...

28:05.600 --> 28:07.977
Okay, well, let's figure it out.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.854
No, come on. You look exhausted.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.524
I'll make it up later in the year
with extra credit or something.

28:12.607 --> 28:15.652
No. Save extra credit for a rainy day.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.114
We have time. Yeah... Yep. Let's do it.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.325
Dad.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.868
It's okay. I'm good.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.956
You can bet the dads
in China and Russia and India

28:28.039 --> 28:30.667
aren't too tired to help
with a little math homework.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.919
You need to know math, kiddo.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.005
You could invent the thing
that saves the world.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.510
That's sweet, but come on, let's be real.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.431
I'm being as real as a cinder block.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.268
Okay.

28:49.477 --> 28:53.857
Okay, so on this one,
we're dealing with radians.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.401
-So...
-Oh, radians. Here we go.

28:56.484 --> 29:00.530
Okay, so the sine value is just the height
of the Y coordinate or two.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.365
But now they wanna know the arcsine.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.324
Or the...

29:03.700 --> 29:05.076
-Um...
- What's your angle?

29:05.702 --> 29:07.328
- Um, forty-five.
- Forty-five.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.497
-And the other one is 45.
- Right.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.541
So 90 right angle.
Really pretty easy.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.418
I could be remembering something
from SAT prep.

29:13.501 --> 29:14.711
Draw the unit circle.
