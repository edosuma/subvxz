00:00.761 --> 00:03.132
All right, I closed out
the cupcake register.

00:03.158 --> 00:04.369
Here is our rent money.

00:04.394 --> 00:07.067
Give me back the envelope, though,
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

00:07.092 --> 00:10.807
No, I closed out the register.
I have our rent money.

00:10.846 --> 00:12.625
Max, do you know
what this means?

00:12.626 --> 00:15.234
Unless I was hit in the head
by a piece of farm equipment,

00:15.250 --> 00:17.258
it means we have extra money.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.177
I wanna do
the extra money dance,

00:19.179 --> 00:22.046
but we don't have one because
we've never had extra money!

00:22.048 --> 00:25.634
The only extra money dance
I know involves ping-pong balls

00:25.635 --> 00:28.118
and I'm really
out of practice.

00:38.552 --> 00:40.558
Earl, I brought you
your favorite.

00:40.559 --> 00:43.170
A half-black, half-Chinese
belly dancer?

00:43.201 --> 00:45.787
A coconut cupcake.

00:45.789 --> 00:47.572
Look at Caroline
over there.

00:47.574 --> 00:49.324
She's flirting harder
with him

00:49.326 --> 00:51.390
than I flirt
with heart disease.

00:51.397 --> 00:54.134
Stop, stop! I'm only
on episode two of season one.

00:54.168 --> 00:56.752
I will kill you!

00:56.754 --> 00:59.221
Then...
To be continued.

00:59.223 --> 01:01.840
Oh! It's gonna be continued...

01:01.842 --> 01:04.459
Well, then,
we will continue this...

01:04.461 --> 01:07.346
When we continue this.

01:09.966 --> 01:13.579
If that's your game, you're gonna
be living with me forever, Fran.

01:13.737 --> 01:17.023
He's been in my section three nights
in a row for the Turkey Club.

01:17.024 --> 01:18.940
I'm calling him
"the Turkey Club cutie".

01:18.976 --> 01:21.977
I'm calling
poison control.

01:21.979 --> 01:23.812
I think he's getting ready
to ask me out.

01:23.814 --> 01:26.469
He wanted to know if I live around
here and what time I get off.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.550
If a man's gonna wait
for you to get off,

01:28.567 --> 01:30.187
he's a keeper.

01:31.705 --> 01:34.039
So...

01:34.041 --> 01:35.174
See you next time.

01:35.176 --> 01:38.298
I will see you next time
as well.

01:39.603 --> 01:41.198
Bye.

01:47.086 --> 01:49.265
- What's that?
- I don't know. How would I know?

01:49.724 --> 01:52.293
Because it came out
of your head...?

01:52.693 --> 01:55.227
I don't have
hair extensions, Max.

01:55.229 --> 01:59.383
- Okay, I'll throw it out.
- No! I'll keep it for this story!

01:59.984 --> 02:01.516
What story?

02:01.518 --> 02:03.368
The story about how we found

02:03.370 --> 02:06.822
a blonde hair extension
out of nowhere that night.

02:06.824 --> 02:09.691
It's hilarious!

02:09.693 --> 02:13.226
Well, it's already funnier
than most of your stories.

02:13.874 --> 02:16.856
Oh, look, there's another
hilarious story!

02:17.141 --> 02:20.421
Okay, Max, I have
a confession to make.

02:21.305 --> 02:24.139
I have hair extensions.

02:24.141 --> 02:26.374
I also have a confession
to make.

02:26.376 --> 02:28.894
I murdered a man
in Rhode Island.

02:28.896 --> 02:31.897
I just have a few.
It gives me volume.

02:31.899 --> 02:34.549
Too bad it doesn't
give you depth.

02:34.551 --> 02:37.569
Now I have to go and try
and reattach these.

02:37.571 --> 02:39.772
These weaves
are supposed to last.

02:39.774 --> 02:41.657
This is unbe-weave-able!

02:44.252 --> 02:47.496
I found this
in the lettuce.

02:47.498 --> 02:50.431
Any sign of a NuvaRing in there?
'Cause I can't find mine.

02:51.235 --> 02:53.919
Caroline's losing her hair,
isn't she?

02:53.921 --> 02:57.206
Is she sick?
Does she have cancer, <i>The Big "C"?</i>

02:57.208 --> 02:59.925
No, <i>Little You</i>.

02:59.927 --> 03:04.429
She doesn't have The Big "C".
She barely has the double "A's".

03:06.266 --> 03:10.302
- Han found more of your hair.
- He knows about the extensions?

03:10.304 --> 03:12.754
No, he thinks you have cancer.

03:12.756 --> 03:15.664
Oh, good!
So no one knows.

03:15.976 --> 03:20.262
Hola, ladies!
Your night just got sexier.

03:20.264 --> 03:23.826
Luis, you punched out hours ago.
What are you doing here so late?

03:23.827 --> 03:25.410
On your way homo?

03:25.486 --> 03:29.288
Good one, hooker!

03:29.546 --> 03:32.941
No, I'm between clubs.
Circus just became a straight club,

03:32.943 --> 03:36.211
and Satellite doesn't become
a gay club for a half hour.

03:36.213 --> 03:39.781
So... I'm here to have a cocktail
with my bro Oleg.

03:39.783 --> 03:42.284
Luis, we told you.
Oleg is straight.

03:42.286 --> 03:45.946
Oh, please!
So am I in Alabama.

03:48.007 --> 03:49.675
Well, he left already.

03:49.677 --> 03:54.646
But I told him I was gonna stop by.
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

03:54.648 --> 03:56.982
Oh, Carolina,
while I'm here...

03:56.984 --> 03:59.634
This is yours.
I found it during my shift.

03:59.636 --> 04:03.357
- Ooh, tips from my tables?
- More like hair from your head.

04:04.108 --> 04:07.743
I knew this was all too good to be true.
You have extensions.

04:07.745 --> 04:10.684
No, I have cancer.

04:18.021 --> 04:22.598
No, you have extensions.
Good try. Later!

04:27.878 --> 04:29.963
Hey.
Notice anything different?

04:29.965 --> 04:33.249
I took some of the extra money
and got new hair extensions.

04:33.251 --> 04:37.570
And I also got you a surprise.
I put it in your room. Go look!

04:37.571 --> 04:39.957
I'm not interested
unless it's a potbelly pig

04:39.958 --> 04:41.900
or a potbelly pig
in a pilgrim costume,

04:41.914 --> 04:44.982
or a pilgrim in a potbelly
pig costume, or just pot.

04:45.498 --> 04:48.961
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.
What do you think? Do you love?

04:48.969 --> 04:52.053
Okay...
Why is all this crap on my bed?

04:52.055 --> 04:54.658
- And what the hell is it?
- That's a bed skirt.

04:54.659 --> 04:57.761
My bed doesn't wear skirts.
It's a dude!

04:59.246 --> 05:02.384
I know, because it pokes me
in the back while I'm asleep.

05:03.083 --> 05:06.501
I got you new bedding, and me
some cute new flannel jammies.

05:06.503 --> 05:08.319
They have Eiffel Towers
on them.

05:08.321 --> 05:11.003
They were marked down because
everybody hates French people.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.709
These don't even have stains!

05:14.711 --> 05:17.289
How am I gonna know
which is the top now?

05:17.581 --> 05:20.932
Max, what's the problem?
You've had those old sheets forever.

05:20.934 --> 05:24.836
- You don't even have a spare set.
- A spare set of sheets?

05:24.838 --> 05:27.338
Who am I,
the Queen of England?

05:27.340 --> 05:29.808
You're so frustrating,
I'd pull my hair out...

05:29.810 --> 05:32.360
But I'm not sure
which of it is mine.

05:32.362 --> 05:34.529
Look! Look!
Are you happy?

05:34.531 --> 05:36.615
Chestnut's upset.
He knows we're fighting.

05:36.617 --> 05:39.701
Good! He should know that if
he goes out for a bag of chips,

05:39.703 --> 05:43.371
he could come home to find
you replaced his saddle with a thong.

05:43.373 --> 05:47.358
I got you a present.
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.928
Who's that?

05:49.930 --> 05:53.865
Max, please. Just for a change,
try sleeping on something nice.

05:53.867 --> 05:55.300
Fine!

05:55.302 --> 05:56.868
But if I wanted to sleep
on something nice,

05:56.870 --> 05:58.520
I would have hooked up
with that guy who moved home

05:58.522 --> 06:00.422
to take care
of his sick mother.

06:01.424 --> 06:03.708
Watch your back, Chestnut.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.584
Watch your back.

06:10.883 --> 06:13.718
Where are my old sheets,
bitch?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.487
Why?

06:15.489 --> 06:19.157
Why are you calling me a "bitch"
at night?

06:19.159 --> 06:22.744
I was sleeping
in my new jammies.

06:22.746 --> 06:24.729
Well, I can't sleep
without those sheets.

06:24.731 --> 06:27.115
So where are they?
I checked all your drawers.

06:27.117 --> 06:31.652
And by the way, who hides
their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

06:32.289 --> 06:35.624
You already know the answer,
so I'm going back to sleep.

06:36.425 --> 06:38.927
Whoa, whoa!

06:38.929 --> 06:41.346
Why!

06:41.348 --> 06:44.582
Why am I on the floor
in my new jammies?

06:44.584 --> 06:46.417
Where are they?

06:46.419 --> 06:48.887
I don't have them.
I gave them to the poor.

06:48.889 --> 06:51.106
You took them
from the poor!

06:51.108 --> 06:53.358
And the poor
wants them back.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.561
Well, it's too late. I put them
in the Salvation Army donation bin.

06:56.563 --> 07:00.415
Well, get up.
You're going to the army, bitch.

07:02.819 --> 07:04.486
Whyyyy?

07:04.488 --> 07:07.105
Why are we here
in the middle of the night?

07:07.107 --> 07:09.341
What are we doing?

07:09.343 --> 07:11.743
Here it is.
Come on, follow me.

07:11.745 --> 07:13.461
Max, is this
where you kill me?

07:13.463 --> 07:17.048
'Cause I always knew it was gonna
happen, I just didn't know when.

07:17.050 --> 07:19.000
This feels right though.

07:19.002 --> 07:20.502
I should kill you.

07:20.504 --> 07:22.971
Those sheets were
really special to me, okay?

07:22.973 --> 07:26.007
Oh, did you lose
your virginities on them?

07:26.009 --> 07:30.295
I don't have sex in beds.
That's where I eat.

07:30.297 --> 07:31.930
Caroline,
I have a confession.

07:31.932 --> 07:34.432
- What is it?
- You have hair extensions.

07:34.434 --> 07:37.758
Okay, I'll tell you,
but look away.

07:37.898 --> 07:41.204
It's the pillowcase.
I've had it since I was a kid.

07:43.943 --> 07:48.496
It's like soft and nubby and it had
this edge that I'd like... rub,

07:48.498 --> 07:51.700
and it relaxed me when things
were crappy, which was all the time.

07:51.702 --> 07:55.370
I guess I still need that pillowcase
to sleep, or whatever.

07:55.372 --> 07:58.362
- Max, that's so sad.
- Of course it's sad!

07:58.368 --> 08:00.742
When has it ever been
a happy tale?

08:01.011 --> 08:03.178
All right,
I need to crawl in here.

08:03.180 --> 08:06.014
Max, you're just gonna crawl
into that dirty box?

08:06.016 --> 08:08.466
We don't know where
that bin's been.

08:08.468 --> 08:12.354
By the way, "dirty box" was my
nickname in continuation school.

08:12.356 --> 08:15.724
I need help. Would you rather
I step on your back or your head?

08:15.726 --> 08:19.217
My head? Hardly.
Not at these prices.

08:19.218 --> 08:21.381
- Come on, gimme ten fingers.
- I already did.

08:21.382 --> 08:23.156
Behind your back
while we were walking here.

08:23.157 --> 08:25.016
No, like this,
so I can step into it.

08:25.018 --> 08:27.585
- You know, like a finger basket.
- Finger basket...?

08:27.586 --> 08:29.718
Is that another nickname
of yours?

08:30.734 --> 08:33.368
No, but for one summer,
it could've been.

08:33.370 --> 08:35.921
Forget this, just let me
pull this stuff over.

08:35.922 --> 08:40.238
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww.

08:40.239 --> 08:43.378
Max, I feel like we're not even
acknowledging our low points anymore.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.464
Okay, Max,
now be very careful.

08:45.466 --> 08:48.767
And on the count of...

08:48.769 --> 08:51.103
Wow! You could've been
a great gymnast,

08:51.105 --> 08:54.306
if you'd had money, coaches,
and a breast reduction.

08:54.308 --> 08:56.275
Are you okay?

08:56.893 --> 08:58.060
Max?

08:58.062 --> 09:00.228
Gonna need
some voice contact.

09:00.230 --> 09:02.948
I'm not in here alone.

09:07.691 --> 09:09.744
What do you mean
you're not alone?

09:09.746 --> 09:12.881
I'm not in here alone.

09:12.883 --> 09:16.394
Stay calm!
I will get you out of there.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.803
No, I won't.

09:18.805 --> 09:21.923
I'm looking
for a lever on the inside.

09:22.892 --> 09:26.778
Get outta my house!

09:26.780 --> 09:29.447
OK, I just wanna check and see
if you're on my pillowcase.

09:29.449 --> 09:32.099
Max, no!
I need my sweet sheets!

09:32.101 --> 09:36.040
Let it go. If your sheets are under
there, they're no long sweet.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.892
Get outta my house!
And close the door!

09:38.894 --> 09:40.744
Okay! Okay!

09:40.746 --> 09:44.180
God, Sheez.
You'd think we'd slept together.

09:44.182 --> 09:47.784
What am I gonna do?
I can't sleep without those sheets!

09:47.786 --> 09:49.378
I'm so angry at you!

09:49.379 --> 09:52.927
I'd be even angrier if I hadn't
found this great bra.

09:56.327 --> 09:59.076
Why are you going to Sophie's
if you're trying to sleep?

09:59.083 --> 10:01.199
She's the loudest person
we know.

10:01.201 --> 10:05.721
Even black people at the movies
tell Sophie to be quiet.

10:06.078 --> 10:08.671
I am going to Sophie's
to get a sleeping pill.

10:08.672 --> 10:10.838
Or as she likes to call them,
"night candy".

10:10.899 --> 10:12.765
You don't need a pill.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.840
Listen, I have a great sleep technique
that my sleep coach taught me.

10:15.841 --> 10:17.814
I have slept with
my fair share of coaches,

10:17.822 --> 10:19.439
and if anything,
they kept me awake.

10:19.441 --> 10:21.441
Max, it's 3:00 A.M.

10:21.443 --> 10:23.853
Any normal person
is sleeping right now.

10:26.113 --> 10:27.613
Hi, girls.

10:27.615 --> 10:30.950
Just doing a puzzle
and listening to Elvis.

10:30.952 --> 10:35.204
You two want a Mai Tai
before you get too Ty-Ty?

10:35.206 --> 10:38.157
No, thanks,
but speaking of Ty-Ty,

10:38.159 --> 10:40.460
I was hoping I could snag
one of your sleeping pills.

10:40.462 --> 10:44.046
Oh, sure, I can hook you up.
I never use them.

10:44.048 --> 10:45.998
I only need three hours
of sleep at night

10:46.000 --> 10:48.935
and six during the day.
Come on.

10:50.804 --> 10:52.305
Sophie...

10:52.307 --> 10:54.524
Notice anything new?

10:54.526 --> 10:55.975
Oh! Yeah!

10:55.977 --> 10:57.860
You planted more hair
on your head.

10:57.862 --> 10:59.612
I heard.

11:00.864 --> 11:03.316
Max! You told her?

11:03.318 --> 11:05.184
No, it was on CNN.

11:05.186 --> 11:09.288
They led with Syria, and then
did a solid five on your hair.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.690
Here we go...
Pills and spices!

11:11.692 --> 11:13.874
You have a spice rack
full of pills?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.629
You gotta cook me dinner
sometime.

11:16.631 --> 11:18.414
Let's see.

11:18.416 --> 11:22.535
Fish oil, penicillin,
amoxicillin...

11:22.537 --> 11:25.471
Skittles.

11:25.473 --> 11:28.508
Oh, and this is
my German pill

11:28.510 --> 11:32.728
in case they release the bombs
or I'm ever abandoned in space.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.983
Here you go, Max.
Nighty-night.

11:36.985 --> 11:38.768
Oh, you know what?

11:38.770 --> 11:41.327
What the hell!
I'm gonna have one two.

11:41.328 --> 11:43.860
It's a slumber party!

11:45.075 --> 11:46.725
Uh-oh.

11:46.727 --> 11:50.446
Oh, now you got another
rack full of pills.

11:51.532 --> 11:53.916
Oh, you know what?

11:53.918 --> 11:57.675
Don't wait for me, Max.
This might be a while.

11:59.424 --> 12:01.841
Max, do you really need
to take that?

12:01.843 --> 12:04.210
People do weird things
on sleeping pills.

12:04.212 --> 12:08.598
My friend Candice Travelstead
buttered a wallet and tried to eat it.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.250
Don't worry,
I don't have a wallet.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.885
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

12:12.887 --> 12:14.587
Is that the sleeping pill,

12:14.589 --> 12:18.524
or is that my emergency
space pill that kills you?

12:18.526 --> 12:20.610
Either way,
I'll get some shut-eye.

12:20.612 --> 12:23.533
Max, no! You are not gonna die
and leave me here alone.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.821
I still don't know how to go East
on the "L" train without a chaperone.

12:28.202 --> 12:29.986
Max, it's 3:30 A.M.,

12:29.988 --> 12:34.788
and sleep coach Caroline here
will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.413
You're supposed to be taking
a hot bath.

12:37.426 --> 12:40.713
I was, but when I put the stopper in,
something pushed it back out again.

12:40.715 --> 12:42.131
Where's that pill?

12:42.133 --> 12:43.782
I've got it on my person,

12:43.784 --> 12:45.801
and if this doesn't work
I'll give it to you.

12:45.803 --> 12:48.888
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill.
And don't think I won't.

12:48.890 --> 12:51.224
Max, meet your new sheets.

12:51.226 --> 12:52.897
New sheets, meet...

12:52.898 --> 12:55.294
Don't make me meet the sheets.
I'm not a mental patient.

12:55.296 --> 12:58.347
If I was, I'd be living
in a much nicer place.

12:58.349 --> 13:00.466
And all my pillowcases
would have edges.

13:00.468 --> 13:02.902
Wow, even your pillowcase
had an edge.

13:02.904 --> 13:04.487
What was it like anyway?

13:04.489 --> 13:06.606
It was kinda like
the end of your new PJ's,

13:06.608 --> 13:09.742
but not the queerest thing
I've ever seen.

13:09.744 --> 13:13.479
A candle?
What are we, witches?

13:13.481 --> 13:17.983
Now, imagine yourself
in a relaxed, beautiful place.

13:17.985 --> 13:21.370
Breathe in and out.

13:21.372 --> 13:23.673
In and out.

13:23.675 --> 13:26.492
Look, if there's one thing
old finger basket know how to do

13:26.494 --> 13:28.511
it's in and out.

13:28.513 --> 13:30.900
- Gimme the pill.
- I'm not finished yet.

13:30.901 --> 13:32.119
But just so you know,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.600
that pill has changed colors
three times in the last hour.

13:34.602 --> 13:38.077
So it's either deadly,
or an everlasting gobstopper.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.640
I am so mad at you.
You took my one thing.

13:40.642 --> 13:43.059
That pillowcase was
my one special thing.

13:43.061 --> 13:45.061
In my whole life of people
taking things away from me,

13:45.063 --> 13:46.812
that was the one thing
no one took,

13:46.814 --> 13:48.414
and now I'm never
gonna sleep again.

13:48.416 --> 13:49.776
And I love sleeping.

13:49.777 --> 13:52.735
Dreaming is the closest thing
I have to cable TV.

13:52.737 --> 13:54.609
Enough, Max!

13:54.610 --> 13:57.490
I've been very patient with
this weird attachment you have

13:57.492 --> 13:59.825
to this little piece of sheet.

13:59.827 --> 14:02.887
You're a <i>piece of sheet</i>.

14:03.164 --> 14:06.132
Listen, if I learned anything
when I lost everything,

14:06.134 --> 14:07.717
it's that, "A,"
there's no wiggle room

14:07.719 --> 14:09.702
when it comes to cottage cheese
expiration dates,

14:09.704 --> 14:13.422
and "B," you can't get
attached to material things.

14:13.424 --> 14:16.092
Oh! Okay, <i>Extensions</i>.

14:16.094 --> 14:17.543
What does that mean?

14:17.545 --> 14:21.547
It means that your material things
are literally attached to your head.

14:21.549 --> 14:22.881
Not the same thing at all.

14:22.883 --> 14:25.901
Your dependency on that pillowcase
is all in your head, you don't need it.

14:25.903 --> 14:27.937
Oh. You don't need this.

14:29.950 --> 14:32.819
You owe me $14. Ah!

14:32.821 --> 14:34.454
Run a tab.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.380
I'm not about to sit here
and take this abuse

14:36.381 --> 14:39.125
because you have an unhealthy
attachment to a pillowcase.

14:39.127 --> 14:40.793
Good night, Malibu Barbie.

14:40.795 --> 14:44.330
I hope you're not trying to insult me,
because she's gorgeous!

14:44.332 --> 14:47.600
And for the record, I do not have
an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

14:47.601 --> 14:48.801
Oh, really...?

14:51.006 --> 14:53.539
You're a monster!

14:55.360 --> 14:58.311
I'm sorry, I can't sleep.

14:58.313 --> 15:01.097
- I'll be fine. Just give me the pill.
- No! It's all in your head!

15:01.099 --> 15:03.433
Go to sleep!

15:03.435 --> 15:07.403
I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope
and locked all the bedroom windows.

15:07.405 --> 15:10.210
Are you trying to hurt me
or turn me on?

15:16.659 --> 15:18.109
Brace yourself, Earl.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.539
When Max gets here, she will
not be in a good mood.

15:20.540 --> 15:25.782
Caroline, if I wanted to work around people
in a good mood, I'd go work at Google.

15:25.784 --> 15:27.835
She hasn't slept
since yesterday

15:27.837 --> 15:30.729
and is furious because I won't
give her a sleeping pill.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.210
Smart move. Sleeping pills mess you up.

15:34.212 --> 15:35.661
I took one once,

15:35.663 --> 15:39.799
woke up a day later on the roller
coaster ride in Coney Island.

15:39.801 --> 15:41.517
I love roller coasters.

15:41.519 --> 15:44.770
Me too,
when I'm in a seat.

15:46.023 --> 15:49.058
Oh, hello!
How are you two tonight?

15:49.060 --> 15:51.677
Oh, no. She's nice.
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

15:51.679 --> 15:54.363
No. No pills.
Just had some clarity.

15:54.365 --> 15:55.666
Follow me, please.

15:55.667 --> 15:59.735
Oh, okay. Did you smoke
or snort this clarity?

15:59.737 --> 16:02.905
Now, since you were nice enough
to get me new sheets,

16:02.907 --> 16:05.491
I got you something in return.
Here.

16:05.493 --> 16:08.861
Oh, is this like an apology,
<i>thank you</i> kind of thing?

16:08.863 --> 16:12.965
Now watch. This is how
one graciously accepts a gift.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.995
What the hell is this?

16:17.289 --> 16:19.172
A wig?

16:19.173 --> 16:23.643
Either that or you scalped
a lesbian from the '80s.

16:23.645 --> 16:27.813
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie and
climbed up on her shoulder pads.

16:27.815 --> 16:29.682
You took away
my security thing...

16:29.684 --> 16:31.350
The pillowcase...

16:31.352 --> 16:33.769
So now I'm taking away your
security thing... your hair.

16:33.771 --> 16:35.237
You can wear that
on your head tonight

16:35.239 --> 16:37.403
and then tell me again
how this is all in my head.

16:37.404 --> 16:39.571
Did you have to get
the ugliest one they had?

16:39.573 --> 16:42.991
What do you want
for 37 cents?

16:42.993 --> 16:45.944
Fine! I'll put this roadkill
on my head

16:45.946 --> 16:48.813
just to prove to you that I am
so much more than my hair.

16:48.815 --> 16:52.918
I am my attitude, my spirit,
my brain, my bravery.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.836
- Put it on.
- Max, I'm scared.

16:54.838 --> 16:57.589
Go.
The bangs go in the back.

16:57.591 --> 17:00.658
That's my kinda woman.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.595
Cobb salad, pick-up!

17:07.049 --> 17:10.050
Uh... hey, Sophie.

17:10.053 --> 17:13.538
Are you here
for the mafia widow discount?

17:15.003 --> 17:17.698
Earl, I'm incognito.

17:17.699 --> 17:20.700
I'm making a drug drop
for Max.

17:20.781 --> 17:24.782
Hey, Max!
I got your drugs!

17:24.785 --> 17:26.617
Thanks.

17:26.619 --> 17:30.188
And I love that you have an outfit
for everything I ask you to do.

17:30.190 --> 17:33.491
Where's the blonde narc,
Max?

17:39.583 --> 17:42.334
Oh, my God!

17:42.336 --> 17:46.264
Did Caroline join
a bowling team?

17:47.223 --> 17:48.873
Max! No!

17:48.875 --> 17:53.087
Aw, crap! Rod Stewart
just busted us.

17:53.597 --> 17:57.048
Let her have some fun.
What's the big deal, square?

17:57.050 --> 17:59.567
The big deal is that Max
thinks she needs these pills

17:59.569 --> 18:01.686
because I threw away
her blankie.

18:01.688 --> 18:04.072
It was a pillowcase,
and I need it to sleep.

18:04.074 --> 18:05.941
She has to rub it.

18:05.943 --> 18:09.945
In Poland, I had this little
thing that I liked to tickle

18:09.947 --> 18:11.663
before I went to sleep.

18:11.821 --> 18:14.768
But my aunt threw it away.

18:14.769 --> 18:16.334
What was it?

18:16.336 --> 18:18.841
My cousin Nora.

18:21.407 --> 18:23.124
Give me the pills.

18:23.126 --> 18:26.594
Nope. And, Max, you were wrong.
See? I'm not attached to my hair.

18:26.595 --> 18:28.609
In fact,
I am loving my new look.

18:28.610 --> 18:31.310
Am I a single mom
trying to keep it simple?

18:31.312 --> 18:34.012
Am I an assistant D.A.
in over my head?

18:34.014 --> 18:38.339
Or am I Charlize Theron
in <i>The Jon Bon Jovi Story?</i>

18:40.683 --> 18:44.577
Maybe, and I'm fine with it.
'Cause I am not my hair.

18:45.273 --> 18:47.407
Oh, my God, Turkey Club cutie!
Hide me!

18:50.992 --> 18:53.560
On your knees in a bad wig.

18:53.570 --> 18:55.715
Listen, girl,
I've been there.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.501
No, I just don't
wanna be seen.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.287
Caroline, Caroline, I love you,
but I can't hear anymore.

19:00.288 --> 19:02.939
That hair was hard enough
to look at in the '70s.

19:06.177 --> 19:08.294
Fine! You were right,
I was wrong.

19:08.295 --> 19:11.017
Now help me get this off.
He can't see me like this.

19:11.018 --> 19:12.634
That's right,
gimme the pills.

19:12.636 --> 19:15.337
Max, no. You don't need them.
We don't know where they've been.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.939
Fine!

19:16.941 --> 19:18.557
I'm going home
to try to sleep.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.859
Since this is all your fault,
you can finish my shift.

19:20.861 --> 19:25.197
You're on your own, lady who lived
across the street from Al Bundy.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.038
I gotta say, I'm pretty
impressed I can do this.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.325
It's not so hard. I don't know what
Chanice is always bitching about.

19:36.327 --> 19:38.911
I guess that's who she is.

19:38.913 --> 19:41.580
I can't believe
I still haven't slept.

19:41.582 --> 19:43.465
I'm gonna be awake forever.

19:43.467 --> 19:46.952
It's gonna be like that movie
<i>Awakenings,</i> but not at all.

19:46.954 --> 19:50.973
Max, you can rub me.

19:51.741 --> 19:55.060
Wow, that wig changed you.

19:55.062 --> 19:56.311
No, here.

19:56.313 --> 19:59.398
Rub the edge on the bottom of my
jammie top like it's your pillowcase.

19:59.400 --> 20:03.986
No. If I rub the bottom of your
jammies, that would be my bottom.

20:03.988 --> 20:05.771
Turkey Club cutie
didn't ask me out,

20:05.773 --> 20:08.490
probably because my hair
was so messed up from the wig.

20:08.492 --> 20:12.995
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It could've been your personality too.

20:12.997 --> 20:15.747
You really think he only
liked you for your hair?

20:15.749 --> 20:17.899
I only like me for my hair.

20:17.901 --> 20:20.902
- Told you. You're attached to it.
- So attached to it!

20:20.904 --> 20:23.372
Twirling it, tossing it,
flipping it.

20:23.374 --> 20:26.541
Feeling it on my neck,
on my shoulders, on my back.

20:26.543 --> 20:31.296
Caroline Channing without the option of
a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.931
And I'm sorry.

20:32.933 --> 20:35.517
I'm sorry I judged you for having
an attachment to something

20:35.519 --> 20:37.085
when I'm no better.

20:37.087 --> 20:39.805
And I'm sorry I got rid
of your sweet sheets.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.807
Max.

20:41.809 --> 20:44.109
Max...?

20:45.144 --> 20:46.778
Night, Max.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.453
Whyyyy?

20:57.274 --> 21:01.027
Why can't I ever
have anything nice?

21:02.435 --> 21:05.435
