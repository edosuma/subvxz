01:26.960 --> 01:28.234
- Hi, Daddy.
- Look at this.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.948
The bad guy shoots Superman
a dozen times...

01:31.160 --> 01:34.357
...see the bullets bounce off,
so they throw their guns at him.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.753
It's like they can't kill him...

01:37.960 --> 01:40.599
...so they think they can give him
a bad bruise.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.875
What a bunch of morons.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.271
Daddy, do you notice
anything different about me?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.272
No, son.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.951
Daddy, it's Kelly.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.271
Tell her to come in.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.157
I am already in.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.432
And I am wearing a brunette wig.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.279
"Why?" you ask.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.556
Because I got picked to do
a public service announcement.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.950
I decided that I should do it
as a brunette...

02:12.160 --> 02:14.993
...since blonds have a reputation
for being dumb.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.752
Which we all know
is just a stereo system.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.153
Pumpkin, Daddy is watching
a very important program.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.436
It's called Superman.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.719
What's the big S stand for?

02:35.800 --> 02:37.552
Straight.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.555
Can't be too careful when you take
your pants off in a phone booth.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.878
Now go away, honey,
I'm studying this kryptonite thing.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.516
If it'll stop Superman,
it might just work on your mother.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.395
Fine. You never pay any attention
to me.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.029
It's why I seek the cash
and affection of older men.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.035
That's nice, pumpkin.
And I do pay attention.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.318
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Peg.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.672
It's me, Dad.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.791
I got to tell you about my day.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.600
I had to give a driving test
to a woman who was so fat...

03:17.840 --> 03:21.389
...they had to shoot her license photo
with the Hubble Telescope.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.752
Listen to me. I don't have time...

03:24.960 --> 03:26.757
...for your shaggy, fat-woman stories.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.556
- You never listen to anyone.
- I listen to Superman.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.832
He and Clark are very wise.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.673
You're a sick man, Dad.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.512
Hey, you're not a sick person
just because you watch Superman.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.719
You're a sick person
if you think you really are Superman.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.953
Hey, Al.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.312
Jefferson.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.350
Peg kept me up half the night.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.718
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
Marcie kept half of me up all night.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.110
Hey, I'm on my way
to a memorabilia auction.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.749
Wanna buy Marcie one
of those original Barbie dolls...

04:18.959 --> 04:20.552
...for her birthday. You wanna come?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.512
No. I don't care much
for memorabilia.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.156
I live my life in the present.
Dragnet is on.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.832
Al.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.634
Guess what I won at bingo.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.991
A concertina.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.757
Come on, Jefferson,
we'll be late for that auction.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.676
Do I have another bid?

04:53.000 --> 04:59.314
Sold for $3200.
Michael Jackson's original nose.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.477
Well, I hope the Barbie bidding
stays low.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.636
I only brought 2 grand.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.950
Two grand for a Barbie doll?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.555
A real woman isn't worth that much.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.350
And the next item up for bid,
still in its original wrapper...

05:16.600 --> 05:20.559
...the first issue of Big 'Uns.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.880
Twelve hundred dollars.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.038
Sold.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.759
- You don't have any money.
- You got 2 grand.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.514
Al, that is money I took from Marcie
for her birthday present.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.672
Jefferson, this is the first issue
of Big 'Uns.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.799
There's 40 pages. That's 80 "uns."

05:49.160 --> 05:51.628
Okay. Maybe I can find
a Barbie for 800.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.316
You won't be able to find
Woodstock Barbie for that.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.474
- "Woodstock Barbie"?
- Oh, yes.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.472
As any Barbiephile would know...

06:00.680 --> 06:03.353
...Woodstock Barbie comes
with elephant-like bell-bottoms...

06:03.560 --> 06:05.232
...and in a poor boy top.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.278
I'm prepared to go as high as 10,000.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.072
And I'm prepared to call
America's Most Wanted.

06:15.520 --> 06:19.991
I was lucky to get this Nurse Barbie
for $800.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.312
Look. They put a bellybutton on her.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.836
I guess they want little girls to know
how the human body really looks.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.237
That's why married Ken
has no genitals.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.836
Well, Jefferson,
I'll see you next week.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.673
Oh, hi, honey.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.435
Hey, Jefferson,
I have your auction catalogue here.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.956
You know, I can't believe
what people pay for these Barbies...

06:46.200 --> 06:49.476
...especially the ones with mistakes.
Look.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.834
A Barbie head on a Ken body
goes for $8000.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.635
And look at this.

06:56.840 --> 07:01.516
Fifty thousand dollars
for a Nurse Barbie with a bellybutton.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.512
I'll tell you, the things people
spend their money on.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.034
Well, if anybody wants me...

07:10.240 --> 07:14.199
...I'll be upstairs
in my new tanning bubble.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.237
Jefferson, it's $50,000.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.950
Well, what are we gonna do?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.917
We...

07:32.680 --> 07:35.399
...say goodbye to you...

07:36.480 --> 07:38.596
...and catch a plane to Aruba.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.796
Al, it's Marcie.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.674
Jefferson Milhouse D'Arcy.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.593
Open this door right now.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.912
I can't give bellybutton Barbie
to Marcie.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.720
It's more valuable than she is.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.913
Hey, wait. Wait. I got an idea.
Go let her in. Go, go.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.470
Hey, Marcie,
I thought I heard some pecking.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.758
Out of my way, swamp gas.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.231
That's Mr. Swamp Gas to you.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.797
I'm sorry about the door, honey.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.389
I just didn't want you to see
your birthday present...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.955
...before I got the price tag off.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.111
Happy birthday.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.675
A rawhide bone, Jefferson?

08:50.640 --> 08:52.039
Now give me back my bone...

08:52.240 --> 08:54.879
...or I'm ripping everybody
a new bellybutton.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.597
Jefferson.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.268
An original Nurse Barbie.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.988
I've wanted this doll all my life.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.310
My parents never let me
have a Barbie.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.156
Instead they bought me
a Chinese backscratcher.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.672
I put clothes and makeup on it,
but it just wasn't the same.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.991
Oh, thank you, honey.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.357
I'm never letting her out of my sight.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.512
Me, neither.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.748
Hey, here comes Popeye.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.310
Hey, Al, you want to try
my squeeze box?

09:49.480 --> 09:53.268
No, Peg, you blew this man down
a long time ago.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.872
Peg? Kelly?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.872
Bud?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.079
Good. Bring on the Big 'Uns.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.390
- Hey, Dad.
- Of course.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.593
Well...

10:25.320 --> 10:28.756
Today, while I was giving
a driving test...

10:30.480 --> 10:35.679
...I learned that windshields are made
from this stuff called safety glass.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.278
That's so no one else will get hurt
when I go flying through it.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.672
Now look, son.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.149
Son, look, it's not that I don't care.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.675
Oh, sure that's part of it.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.789
But the main thing is...

10:53.000 --> 10:55.230
...I've got something very important
to do.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.998
Big 'Uns?

10:59.560 --> 11:02.472
Some bigger than your entire body.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.877
Now, son, you've got two choices.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.113
Get out or get the hell out.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.634
Fine.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.990
You never pay any attention to me.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.273
Is it any wonder I seek the affections
of sleazy bar maids...

11:25.480 --> 11:27.550
...and 25-cent movies?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.755
Gee, now I feel bad.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.755
Yep, now I feel good.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.110
Look, Daddy, I changed my mind.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.920
I decided that it is not
the colour of the hair...

11:57.360 --> 12:00.670
...but the head that it's stuck to,
that is important.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.439
Ergo, I have decided
to do the announcement...

12:04.680 --> 12:08.434
...proudly wearing this blond wig.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.275
But, pumpkin,
that's your real hair colour.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.436
They don't know that.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.238
That's a good point, sweetheart.
Now, you leave Daddy alone now.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.434
Okay.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.835
I don't think Daddy was
listening to me.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.992
I'll bet he's got a Big 'Uns
under the couch.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.036
Oh, well, the important thing
to remember...

12:37.280 --> 12:41.956
...is I'm going up the stairs,
up the stairs. Wait.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.392
Where was I going?

12:45.680 --> 12:50.151
Oh, yeah. Up the stairs, up the stairs.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.153
I got a big problem, Al.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.277
Marcie hasn't let go
of that Barbie doll...

12:57.480 --> 12:59.391
...since I gave it to her.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.479
I need you to do me a little favour.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.518
Can I do it
while I'm reading my magazine?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.309
You know, that magazine
still belongs to me...

13:08.520 --> 13:10.829
...until you've paid me for it.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.557
What is the favour?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.834
I need you to sleep with Marcie.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.997
I don't mean sleep with her.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.840
Just lie next to her
so I can switch that Barbie...

13:29.040 --> 13:30.678
...with the regular Nurse Barbie.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.956
The Barbiephile
that we saw at the auction...

13:33.160 --> 13:35.390
...will give me $50,000
and the substitute.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.672
It'd just take an hour
until I make the trade. How about it?

13:39.560 --> 13:43.633
Jefferson. Peg might wake up
and notice me gone...

13:43.840 --> 13:48.550
...and then it might ruin
an otherwise-sickening marriage.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.793
Hey, look, Al. She's dancing.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.600
Oh, all right, I'll do it.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.671
Al, I'm so glad you're home.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.510
Gladys has just taught myself
and the entire neighbourhood...

14:05.760 --> 14:09.389
..."John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt."

14:12.120 --> 14:16.238
I'll leave my pyjamas
under the weeping willow tree.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.792
Good move.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.390
Hit it, girls.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.878
What took you so long?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.712
You haven't lived until you heard...

14:50.920 --> 14:53.798
..."Itsy Bitsy Spider"
played on a concertina.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.388
And speaking of things
I'm afraid of with hairy legs...

14:57.600 --> 14:59.750
...let's get this thing over with.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.239
- You're sure she won't wake up?
- Positive.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.278
We just had sex three times.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.077
And I did her real good.

15:26.160 --> 15:30.039
Okay, I switched the Barbie
with a Chinese backscratcher.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.872
One hour, Jefferson.
You better be back here in one hour.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.111
One hour.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.108
And if you hear a noise
coming from across the hall...

15:40.320 --> 15:41.799
...that's Marcie's niece, Amber.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.436
Anything else I should know?

15:44.680 --> 15:48.389
Well, Marcie likes me to sleep
with my hand on her tush.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.549
It'll keep her from waking up.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.031
Jefferson, where are you?

16:33.920 --> 16:37.595
Well, Jefferson isn't back yet.
There's a shock.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.030
Fifty grand in his pock et
and me with his wife.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.151
Gee, who came out ahead?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.440
To hell with this,
I'm getting out of here.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.955
Hello? Peggy?

16:55.200 --> 16:58.397
I'm worried about Al. He's missing.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.471
I thought maybe
he was with Jefferson.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.395
No, my Jefferson's right here.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.912
Gee.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.079
You know, his remote is cold.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.238
And the toilet seat is dry.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.673
Where do you think he could be?

17:19.920 --> 17:22.832
Well, maybe
he's with another woman.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.839
Listen, don't you worry, Peggy...

17:29.040 --> 17:31.793
...if we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.309
Jefferson.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.358
You want to take me again?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.311
Come on, I don't mean to criticize...

17:58.520 --> 18:02.479
...but you didn't really satisfy me
earlier.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.951
Aunt Marcie,
do you have a heating pad?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.431
There's one in the nightstand.
Are you sick?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.148
I'm on my period.
You know how it is.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.958
Yeah, I know the feeling.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.875
I've gone to the super tampons
lately myself.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.189
The things that happen...

18:24.400 --> 18:27.597
...when you forget to pack
your cyanide pill.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.594
Even my breasts are swollen.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.949
Want to see?

18:37.120 --> 18:40.829
Not here. We don't want to wake
Uncle Jefferson.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.996
Jefferson, rub my back.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.990
That's my chest.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.076
I can't get back in bed with her.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.390
But on the good side,
soon Marcie will get up,

19:21.600 --> 19:24.398
I'll see her pluck ed nak ed
and drop dead.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.759
I'm sorry I'm late, buddy.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.911
I swapped the Barbie's,
I got the 50 thou.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.033
I was on my way back
when I got the urge to gamble.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.952
I felt a lucky streak coming on...

19:37.160 --> 19:39.355
...so I decided to run
my 50 thou into 100.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.115
- Well, did you?
- No, I lost it all.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.997
So did I. I wouldn't go
in your bathroom if I were you.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.319
Your shirt is all wet.
You even sweat in bed?

19:53.560 --> 19:56.074
Those are tears, Jefferson.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.191
Jefferson?

20:05.040 --> 20:08.476
- She's waking up. Go. Go.
- I'm going.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.349
- Did you hear someone screaming?
- Yeah.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.551
It was probably Al falling
from the window...

20:20.760 --> 20:23.194
...after having slept with you.

20:40.800 --> 20:44.349
Al Bundy, where have you been?

20:45.960 --> 20:48.315
Sleeping with Marcie.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.595
Don't you lie to me.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.270
You have been
at Shecky's All Night Chicken Shack.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.118
Haven't you?

20:57.960 --> 21:00.428
And I've been up all night,
worried sick.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.878
Pacing, fretting, cleaning...
Which I should do more often.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.839
Do you know that I found a magazine
underneath that couch...

21:08.040 --> 21:09.519
...that was over 40 years old?

21:13.760 --> 21:15.671
Oh, no.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.673
Where is it?

21:17.920 --> 21:19.353
I threw it out.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.276
Oh, Peg. Peg, I want my Big 'Uns.

21:24.520 --> 21:29.674
Oh, honey, you want Big 'Uns?

21:29.920 --> 21:34.994
- I'll give you Big 'Uns.
- No, I said, Big 'Uns. Not those ones.
