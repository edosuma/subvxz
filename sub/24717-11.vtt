WEBVTT

00:01.901 --> 00:05.279
A secret alliance
hidden in plain sight.

00:09.894 --> 00:13.179
Has a deal been done? I think

00:13.334 --> 00:15.265
we don't know the whole picture.

00:15.341 --> 00:17.692
Joint space missions

00:17.867 --> 00:20.439
with undisclosed agendas.

00:20.461 --> 00:21.399
Why do we not have

00:21.421 --> 00:23.485
a good HD photograph

00:23.641 --> 00:27.625
of whatever that big tower is?
Why?

00:27.627 --> 00:30.119
Have the United States
and Russia

00:30.141 --> 00:32.872
been working together
from the very beginning

00:33.047 --> 00:34.332
of the Space Race...

00:34.441 --> 00:37.105
Both Russia and the U.S. know

00:37.107 --> 00:39.879
about working
extraterrestrial technology.

00:39.901 --> 00:41.765
...in preparation
for the ultimate

00:41.921 --> 00:44.319
extraterrestrial encounter?

00:44.474 --> 00:46.432
Cooperation is the only way

00:46.587 --> 00:48.452
that we could actually achieve
some sort

00:48.454 --> 00:49.999
of mutual defense
of the planet Earth.

Seoul, South Korea.

01:25.394 --> 01:28.699
March 26, 2012.

01:28.854 --> 01:32.792
The leaders
of over 50 nations gather

01:32.794 --> 01:34.852
for the Nuclear Security Summit,

01:35.027 --> 01:37.792
a two-day conference
to discuss issues

01:37.794 --> 01:42.112
regarding the proliferation and
safekeeping of nuclear weapons.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.745
During a photo op between

01:44.921 --> 01:46.385
American President Barack Obama

01:46.541 --> 01:49.105
and Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev,

01:49.107 --> 01:50.905
who was soon to be replaced

01:51.061 --> 01:53.259
by then Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin,

01:53.414 --> 01:55.132
the two leaders

01:55.287 --> 01:58.359
have an off-the-record
conversation that raises more

01:58.534 --> 02:00.259
than a few eyebrows.

02:12.281 --> 02:14.912
But even more intriguing
were recorded

02:14.914 --> 02:17.192
but not filmed comments

02:17.281 --> 02:19.979
in which President Obama
told Medvedev,

02:20.001 --> 02:22.965
"It's important for him
to give me space."

02:22.967 --> 02:25.405
And to which Medvedev replied,

02:25.461 --> 02:29.372
"I understand
your message about space."

02:29.461 --> 02:33.152
The revelation
was extraordinary.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.619
President Obama's quote was,

02:35.774 --> 02:39.492
"It's important for him
to give me space."

02:39.494 --> 02:40.939
What does that mean?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.252
Some people think
it simply means breathing space,

02:43.427 --> 02:44.719
space to operate,

02:44.721 --> 02:47.005
room to maneuver politically.

02:47.007 --> 02:49.312
But there is an interpretation

02:49.401 --> 02:52.085
that suggests
he meant literally.

02:52.261 --> 02:55.252
"It's important for him
to give me space."

02:55.407 --> 02:57.065
Outer space.

02:57.221 --> 03:01.612
Any time you hear
governments talk about space,

03:01.701 --> 03:03.485
you hear them talk
about space exploration,

03:03.541 --> 03:06.399
trust me, the-the underlying,

03:06.554 --> 03:09.932
implied, unspoken reality
behind that

03:09.934 --> 03:12.825
is the alien presence.

03:12.827 --> 03:16.272
It is possible
that Russia and America,

03:16.274 --> 03:20.325
in some aspects
of the space question

03:20.401 --> 03:22.659
and maybe
the extraterrestrial question,

03:22.681 --> 03:25.019
maybe they are working together
after all.

03:26.321 --> 03:28.239
Is it possible

03:28.394 --> 03:29.892
that, even between two
of the world's

03:29.981 --> 03:32.652
most powerful political rivals,

03:32.741 --> 03:35.452
there is a secret understanding,

03:35.454 --> 03:38.025
one based
on America and Russia's past

03:38.081 --> 03:41.785
and future roles in outer space?

03:41.941 --> 03:45.765
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

03:45.841 --> 03:50.092
and they also believe that this
secret understanding extends

03:50.094 --> 03:52.752
to numerous experiences
involving

03:52.907 --> 03:55.065
extraterrestrial contact.

03:55.141 --> 03:57.272
As evidence,

03:57.427 --> 03:59.599
they point to an occasion
that took place

03:59.754 --> 04:03.472
just a few months after
Medvedev's now-famous exchange

04:03.627 --> 04:04.999
with Barack Obama.

04:05.021 --> 04:08.579
On December 7, 2012,

04:08.601 --> 04:11.939
after giving a primetime network
interview in Moscow,

04:12.094 --> 04:14.925
Medvedev made remarks offstage

04:14.981 --> 04:16.851
which seemed
to openly acknowledge

04:16.940 --> 04:19.418
the existence
of extraterrestrials

04:19.461 --> 04:21.319
and the Russian government's
efforts

04:21.494 --> 04:24.445
to keep that existence a secret.

04:44.061 --> 04:47.319
Although most
of the journalists in the room

04:47.361 --> 04:49.579
believed
the Russian president's remarks

04:49.601 --> 04:51.092
to have been made in jest,

04:51.267 --> 04:54.159
there were others
who were not so certain.

04:54.314 --> 04:57.539
This is one
of the most dramatic statements

04:57.581 --> 05:00.985
that emanates out of Russia,
and so it's fascinating.

05:00.987 --> 05:03.979
Dmitry Medvedev said, "When you
become president of Russia",

05:03.981 --> 05:08.185
"you're given information
on aliens in our country

05:08.341 --> 05:12.912
and the human groups
that are monitoring them."

05:13.067 --> 05:16.099
He was totally with a straight
face during all of this.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.059
Here he is on film saying

05:23.214 --> 05:27.592
that there is a secret
governmental cooperation

05:27.594 --> 05:29.319
occurring in the background

05:29.474 --> 05:32.892
that has the highest levels
of classification

05:33.047 --> 05:35.432
to really monitor
extraterrestrials

05:35.587 --> 05:37.779
that are visiting our planet.

05:39.254 --> 05:40.892
Forget all the differences.

05:41.001 --> 05:42.779
Forget ideologies.

05:42.934 --> 05:44.672
At the highest level,

05:44.674 --> 05:46.532
the two nations work together.

05:46.687 --> 05:49.119
After World War II,

05:49.121 --> 05:51.492
there was a number
of UFO encounters,

05:51.581 --> 05:53.872
very important encounters,

05:54.027 --> 05:58.452
and this gave impetus to joint
cooperation between our nations.

05:58.607 --> 06:02.039
Joint cooperation?

06:02.041 --> 06:05.299
Even during the tension-filled
decades of the Cold War?

06:05.301 --> 06:07.972
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

06:08.127 --> 06:11.305
that not only did such
a secret relationship exist

06:11.481 --> 06:14.772
but that it began
several decades ago

06:14.927 --> 06:17.519
as a consequence
of what they believe

06:17.521 --> 06:21.992
to be the Soviet Union's
first documented UFO encounter,

06:21.994 --> 06:25.299
an event
they commonly refer to

06:25.321 --> 06:28.119
as the Russian Roswell.

06:30.254 --> 06:32.759
Southern Russia.

06:32.801 --> 06:36.472
June 19, 1948.

06:36.627 --> 06:39.499
At a remote
Soviet military installation

06:39.674 --> 06:42.012
known as Kapustin Yar,

06:42.167 --> 06:44.485
an unidentified flying object

06:44.661 --> 06:46.399
is detected over the base.

06:46.441 --> 06:48.939
Strange blips
were seen on radar.

06:49.114 --> 06:50.512
Something was tracked

06:50.667 --> 06:53.352
performing extraordinary speeds
and maneuvers.

06:53.441 --> 06:57.092
And a Russian fighter jet
was sent to intercept it.

06:57.267 --> 07:00.285
The pilot saw

07:00.287 --> 07:03.192
a silver cigar-shaped object

07:03.347 --> 07:06.165
and was told,
"Shoot this thing down.

07:06.167 --> 07:09.379
It's in restricted
military airspace."

07:12.294 --> 07:16.392
The UFO fired some sort
of directed energy weapon,

07:16.394 --> 07:18.379
a death ray.

07:18.534 --> 07:20.612
But before the Russian jet
was downed,

07:20.787 --> 07:22.485
it managed to launch a missile

07:22.641 --> 07:25.425
and shoot down the UFO.

07:25.581 --> 07:28.585
Some people have speculated

07:28.641 --> 07:31.705
this was the time
that the Russians found out

07:31.861 --> 07:34.379
about extraterrestrials.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.445
According
to the myths and legends,

07:37.447 --> 07:40.032
at Kapustin Yar,
they actually recovered bodies,

07:40.187 --> 07:42.272
they recovered
the spacecraft itself,

07:42.427 --> 07:46.292
and it was kept there for study
and reverse engineering.

07:46.294 --> 07:48.839
We are told that there is

07:48.861 --> 07:52.339
a underground facility
under Kapustin Yar,

07:52.381 --> 07:54.905
similar, probably, to facilities
here in the States,

07:54.961 --> 07:58.319
where a full examination
could be performed

07:58.341 --> 08:01.259
on the pilots of these craft.

08:03.927 --> 08:07.585
To ancient astronaut
theorists and researchers,

08:07.641 --> 08:11.285
what makes the Kapustin Yar
story all the more significant

08:11.341 --> 08:13.492
is that it occurred
within a year

08:13.494 --> 08:16.205
of the now-infamous
Roswell incident,

08:16.281 --> 08:20.199
in which a UFO reportedly
crashed in the New Mexico desert

08:20.241 --> 08:24.872
sometime in June of 1947.

08:24.874 --> 08:28.179
That took place
near the only active

08:28.201 --> 08:30.959
military unit in the world
that had nuclear weapons.

08:31.114 --> 08:33.672
That was
the Roswell 509th Bombing Unit,

08:33.827 --> 08:35.239
and they had nukes.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.105
Similarly,
over at the Soviet Union,

08:38.160 --> 08:40.899
at places like Kapustin Yar,

08:41.054 --> 08:44.999
we've got significant
UFO activity being reported,

08:45.001 --> 08:47.479
military engagements,

08:47.634 --> 08:48.874
just like in the United States.

08:48.954 --> 08:51.239
And I personally believe

08:51.394 --> 08:53.212
that extraterrestrials
had a strong interest

08:53.367 --> 08:55.772
in the nuclear technologies
that were then developing

08:55.774 --> 08:57.592
on planet Earth,

08:57.747 --> 09:00.005
which is exactly why
they were there.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.239
Could it be
that both the Kapustin Yar

09:02.394 --> 09:04.679
and Roswell incidents
were attempts

09:04.681 --> 09:06.605
by extraterrestrials

09:06.607 --> 09:08.659
to make contact
because of mankind's

09:08.814 --> 09:11.539
recent development
of nuclear weapons?

09:11.694 --> 09:14.419
But if such contact did occur,

09:14.594 --> 09:17.832
did it signal an era
of secret cooperation

09:17.987 --> 09:19.825
between the world's
two great superpowers

09:20.001 --> 09:22.385
or did it only trigger

09:22.387 --> 09:24.932
a greater degree of rivalry
and competition?

09:25.087 --> 09:28.285
In Roswell, you had the crash.

09:28.341 --> 09:31.505
You had the recovered
alien bodies, but the aliens

09:31.507 --> 09:33.390
were dead. There was no way
to communicate with them,

09:33.414 --> 09:35.072
because they had been killed.

09:35.227 --> 09:37.919
So we had the technology

09:37.941 --> 09:39.645
but probably no really good idea

09:39.801 --> 09:41.912
on how to start
reverse engineering it.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.825
Whereas at Kapustin Yar,
as the story goes,

09:44.827 --> 09:47.019
they not only got
the spacecraft itself

09:47.194 --> 09:48.759
but, apparently, there was

09:48.781 --> 09:50.659
at least one survivor
of the incident.

09:50.814 --> 09:54.065
So what could the Russians
possibly have learned

09:54.121 --> 09:58.012
from that alien extraterrestrial
biological entity

09:58.167 --> 10:01.852
that we were not able to learn
from our Roswell incident?

10:02.027 --> 10:05.445
Why were the Russians first
into space?

10:05.501 --> 10:08.492
Why did they manage
to do Sputnik 1

10:08.667 --> 10:11.639
and then send Yuri Gagarin up
into orbit

10:11.794 --> 10:14.452
and leave the Americans
standing?

10:14.561 --> 10:18.445
Because, on paper, you'd think
that the U.S. government

10:18.447 --> 10:20.892
should have won that race,
but they didn't.

10:20.901 --> 10:24.412
If the Russians got live aliens,

10:24.414 --> 10:27.159
maybe they found out something
from what happened

10:27.201 --> 10:31.399
at Kapustin Yar that gave them
the edge in the Space Race.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.659
Is it possible
that the Soviet Union

10:35.814 --> 10:39.499
gained a strategic advantage
in the so-called Space Race

10:39.654 --> 10:43.899
because of help it received from
an extraterrestrial visitor?

10:44.054 --> 10:46.559
But if so,

10:46.561 --> 10:49.439
then how did the United States
so quickly catch up

10:49.461 --> 10:52.319
and... some would argue...
overtake them

10:52.474 --> 10:55.985
by being the first
to put humans on the moon?

10:56.061 --> 11:00.252
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

11:00.361 --> 11:03.279
the answers are easily obtained,
not by examining

11:03.434 --> 11:06.925
what the two nations were
each admitting to in public,

11:06.981 --> 11:09.192
but what they
were doing together...

11:09.281 --> 11:16.105
in secret.

11:16.107 --> 11:19.985
July 17, 1975.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.119
Moscow is go for docking.

11:22.121 --> 11:24.399
Houston is go for docking.
It's up to you guys.

11:24.574 --> 11:26.452
High above the Earth,

11:26.607 --> 11:29.399
an American Apollo
Command/Service Module docks

11:29.421 --> 11:31.485
with its Soviet counterpart,

11:31.541 --> 11:34.665
the <i> Soyuz 19.</i>

11:34.821 --> 11:37.792
A few hours later,
the two mission commanders,

11:37.881 --> 11:40.559
Thomas Stafford
and Alexey Leonov,

11:40.714 --> 11:43.239
shake hands
through the open hatch,

11:43.261 --> 11:45.319
the first
international handshake

11:45.361 --> 11:48.085
to take place in space.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.652
The historic mission,

11:50.827 --> 11:53.585
officially known as
the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project,

11:53.661 --> 11:56.925
marked the end of the Space Race

11:57.101 --> 12:01.905
that began when the Soviets
launched Sputnik back in 1957

12:02.081 --> 12:05.332
and ushered in a new era
of open collaboration in space

12:05.487 --> 12:09.072
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

12:09.161 --> 12:13.172
The 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission

12:13.327 --> 12:17.679
was in itself an expression of
cooperation of our two nations.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.505
Detente was coming.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.332
Hopes for cooperation.

12:23.507 --> 12:25.112
Hopes for future
space exploration.

12:25.114 --> 12:27.039
Friendship.

12:27.061 --> 12:31.472
While Apollo-Soyuz was
the first public demonstration

12:31.627 --> 12:34.945
of American and Soviet
cooperation in space,

12:34.947 --> 12:37.579
there were many who believed
that that collaboration

12:37.734 --> 12:41.559
began decades earlier,
following two separate events

12:41.581 --> 12:44.699
that involved
extraterrestrial visitations:

12:44.874 --> 12:48.225
one in Roswell, New Mexico,

12:48.301 --> 12:50.945
and another,
known as Kapustin Yar,

12:51.001 --> 12:54.045
which happened
near the town of Znamensk,

12:54.047 --> 12:57.712
in the western region
of the former Soviet Union.

12:57.801 --> 12:59.732
There's an argument
that suggests

12:59.734 --> 13:01.712
the Apollo-Soyuz mission

13:01.801 --> 13:04.965
was actually
a sort of soft disclosure.

13:05.021 --> 13:08.265
Getting the story out there
in a quiet way

13:08.421 --> 13:13.059
so that there would be no great
bombshell revelation later.

13:14.234 --> 13:16.359
Moscow.

13:16.514 --> 13:20.205
July 1965.

13:20.361 --> 13:24.785
Exactly one decade prior to the
historic Apollo-Soyuz mission,

13:24.941 --> 13:29.512
scientists at the Sternberg
Astronomical Institute analyze

13:29.667 --> 13:32.172
a series of 25 photographs
of the Moon

13:32.174 --> 13:36.379
transmitted from the Soviet
unmanned probe,<i> Zond 3.</i>

13:36.534 --> 13:39.459
The images, taken
approximately 7,000 miles away

13:39.634 --> 13:41.552
from the lunar surface,

13:41.707 --> 13:43.739
are unprecedented in quality

13:43.761 --> 13:46.432
and offer the first clear view

13:46.441 --> 13:49.039
of the far side of the moon.

13:49.194 --> 13:52.172
In the years following
the <i> Zond 3</i> mission,

13:52.174 --> 13:55.199
researchers have argued
that the 25 photographs

13:55.374 --> 13:57.385
show structures on the Moon

13:57.441 --> 14:00.659
that did not occur naturally.

14:00.814 --> 14:02.974
There were clear anomalies
that had been seen on camera

14:03.114 --> 14:04.419
for the first time.

14:04.461 --> 14:06.979
One was kind of a giant dome

14:06.981 --> 14:09.479
that appeared to have
a glass-like structure

14:09.501 --> 14:11.732
to the top of it that had been
shattered and beaten up.

14:11.734 --> 14:15.159
And in another image,
there was a 20-mile-high tower

14:15.161 --> 14:19.319
that was plainly visible on the
photographs that were published.

14:19.341 --> 14:22.052
Knowing the secrecy
of the Soviets during this era,

14:22.061 --> 14:25.465
it's quite possible
that they had other pictures

14:25.467 --> 14:30.059
that might reveal
what these structures are.

14:30.214 --> 14:32.959
Why do we not have
a good HD photograph

14:33.114 --> 14:35.739
of whatever that big tower is

14:35.894 --> 14:38.645
that the <i> Zond 3</i> probe
took in 1965?

14:38.647 --> 14:40.612
Why?

14:40.621 --> 14:44.599
Those pictures
are still classified in Russia,

14:44.754 --> 14:47.125
as they were
in the Soviet Union.

14:47.281 --> 14:51.339
Apparently, some 25 pictures
were transferred to NASA.

14:51.381 --> 14:52.952
I don't know how.

14:53.107 --> 14:54.832
Was this a CIA operation,

14:54.987 --> 14:58.019
or was this an actual transfer
of information,

14:58.041 --> 15:01.132
which again shows you
the level of exchange

15:01.287 --> 15:03.425
of cooperation
between our governments?

15:03.427 --> 15:05.739
Something that's classified
in Russia

15:05.894 --> 15:09.265
is openly available
in the United States?

15:09.267 --> 15:12.439
Did the Russians
discover evidence

15:12.594 --> 15:15.245
of artificial structures
on the Moon

15:15.247 --> 15:18.779
four years before the American
astronauts landed there?

15:20.621 --> 15:22.472
And if so,

15:22.647 --> 15:24.599
did they secretly communicate
their findings

15:24.774 --> 15:26.485
in order to help guide
NASA's plans

15:26.487 --> 15:30.605
for the first manned mission
to the Moon?

15:30.661 --> 15:32.499
Ancient astronaut theorists

15:32.654 --> 15:35.645
believe that such
an audacious notion may be true,

15:35.701 --> 15:38.105
and also suggest that,

15:38.181 --> 15:40.712
while the United States
later became focused

15:40.801 --> 15:43.479
on launching
its Space Shuttle program,

15:43.501 --> 15:46.952
the Russians journeyed
even deeper into space

15:47.127 --> 15:50.692
in search of further evidence
of extraterrestrial activity

15:50.847 --> 15:52.599
in our solar system.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.939
Baikonur Cosmodrome.

15:59.207 --> 16:02.199
July 1988.

16:02.354 --> 16:05.765
The Soviet Union
launches two probes

16:05.921 --> 16:08.799
which are each programmed
to photograph Phobos,

16:08.821 --> 16:12.185
one of the two moons
that orbit the planet Mars.

16:12.187 --> 16:15.539
Although the first probe fails
to reach its target,

16:15.694 --> 16:18.419
the second proves
more successful.

16:18.574 --> 16:22.392
Named <i> Phobos 2,</i>
it uses sophisticated cameras

16:22.394 --> 16:26.559
and infrared lasers to collect
and transmit photos and data

16:26.601 --> 16:29.912
about the atmosphere and surface
of the Martian moon.

16:30.087 --> 16:33.025
In the final stage
of its mission,

16:33.027 --> 16:36.425
the probe attempts a landing
on the moon's surface.

16:36.581 --> 16:38.845
Suddenly, without warning,

16:39.021 --> 16:41.779
the Russian craft
stops transmitting...

16:41.781 --> 16:46.779
but not until it relays
one last incredible photo.

16:46.934 --> 16:50.032
As they got closer with <i> Phobos,</i>
we see one last frame

16:50.121 --> 16:52.145
that seems to have showed up.

16:52.301 --> 16:55.659
What appears to be
some type of laser beam,

16:55.814 --> 16:58.972
or some type of object,
coming from Phobos

16:58.974 --> 17:00.859
and disabling the satellite.

17:00.881 --> 17:04.118
And a very large
cigar-shaped shadow,

17:04.121 --> 17:07.172
as if it's possibly
a large craft of some kind

17:07.261 --> 17:09.244
hovering above the surface.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.672
There have been members
of the Soviet Science Academy

17:12.827 --> 17:15.625
and actual cosmonauts,
like Marina Popovich,

17:15.681 --> 17:17.659
who came right out and said
that the reports

17:17.814 --> 17:19.819
inside the Soviet Union

17:19.993 --> 17:22.858
indicated that <i> Phobos 2</i>
had been shot down.

17:24.847 --> 17:28.005
What happened
to the <i> Phobos 2</i> probe?

17:28.080 --> 17:31.732
Did it really photograph
an alien craft?

17:31.821 --> 17:34.492
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

17:34.647 --> 17:36.759
and point
to another Mars mission,

17:36.914 --> 17:38.965
almost a decade later,

17:38.967 --> 17:43.525
as proof of an extraterrestrial
presence on Phobos.

17:43.581 --> 17:47.285
In 1998,
NASA's <i> Mars Global Surveyor</i>

17:47.341 --> 17:49.339
took images of Phobos...

17:49.494 --> 17:51.905
revealing a monolith

17:51.981 --> 17:55.185
279 feet in length.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.492
Instantly, ancient astronaut
theorists and others

17:57.647 --> 17:59.483
connected this to what
the Soviets had discovered

17:59.507 --> 18:01.105
in the 1980s

18:01.107 --> 18:03.845
and hypothesized
that perhaps there is

18:03.901 --> 18:07.339
a working extraterrestrial
element on Mars that seeks

18:07.361 --> 18:11.859
to prevent us from discovering
the secrets of Phobos.

18:11.861 --> 18:15.265
Now we have a situation
where both Russia and the U.S.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.152
know about this.

18:17.307 --> 18:19.959
And perhaps
it's not just artifacts

18:20.114 --> 18:23.099
and ancient civilizations

18:23.121 --> 18:25.959
but working
extraterrestrial technology.

18:27.434 --> 18:30.099
Were otherworldly forces

18:30.141 --> 18:33.472
guiding both the U.S.
and Soviet space programs

18:33.481 --> 18:36.485
in an effort to encourage
peaceful cooperation

18:36.487 --> 18:40.059
between the world's
two great nuclear adversaries?

18:40.214 --> 18:44.132
Although such a far-fetched
notion seems absurd,

18:44.307 --> 18:45.939
there are many who believe that

18:46.094 --> 18:49.839
not only was extraterrestrial
contact taking place

18:49.994 --> 18:53.265
but that it had been happening
for dozens of years,

18:53.321 --> 18:56.872
and that one such incident
involved a number

18:57.027 --> 19:00.732
of top secret communications
between a Russian scientist

19:00.841 --> 19:04.759
and what he believed to be
his alien ancestors.

19:12.094 --> 19:14.745
Kaluga, Russia.

19:14.801 --> 19:17.512
May 1903.

19:17.601 --> 19:19.432
Little-known
Russian schoolteacher

19:19.587 --> 19:23.045
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
publishes a landmark paper

19:23.101 --> 19:26.012
on rocket science titled

19:26.014 --> 19:30.459
"Exploration of Outer Space
by Means of Rocket Devices."

19:30.614 --> 19:32.619
At a time
when the Wright Brothers

19:32.774 --> 19:36.032
are still working to achieve
the first powered flight,

19:36.041 --> 19:38.845
Tsiolkovsky writes
about groundbreaking concepts

19:39.021 --> 19:42.572
for the exploration of space,
including what he calls

19:42.727 --> 19:45.152
the "ideal rocket equation,"

19:45.261 --> 19:48.225
a formula which calculates
the amount of velocity needed

19:48.401 --> 19:52.419
to lift a body into outer space.

19:52.421 --> 19:55.552
Incredibly, his theories
would prove instrumental

19:55.707 --> 19:58.765
in helping the Soviet Union
launch the first man-made object

19:58.767 --> 20:01.972
into orbit
more than 50 years later.

20:02.127 --> 20:04.085
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wasn't

20:04.241 --> 20:06.132
a classically trained scientist,

20:06.287 --> 20:08.945
he was a secondary school
math teacher.

20:08.947 --> 20:11.552
But he was so enamored
with getting into space

20:11.727 --> 20:15.619
that he created the rocket
science and mathematics

20:15.774 --> 20:20.139
in the early 1900s
that led to the first thing

20:20.161 --> 20:23.805
created by humanity to be
launched into space, Sputnik.

20:23.881 --> 20:25.839
To put into perspective

20:25.994 --> 20:29.039
how influential
Tsiolkovsky's work was,

20:29.194 --> 20:31.039
this is the basis work

20:31.214 --> 20:33.839
that everybody had to use later.

20:33.994 --> 20:37.412
Von Braun used it
during his research on rockets,

20:37.587 --> 20:41.272
and most of the world sees
the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation

20:41.274 --> 20:44.439
as the beginning
of modern rocket science.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.865
Where did he get those ideas?

21:06.867 --> 21:08.379
Where does his knowledge
come from?

21:10.221 --> 21:12.912
His ideas about space

21:13.067 --> 21:15.965
and civilizations that
populate it were incredible,

21:16.121 --> 21:18.965
and he persisted
that when humans

21:18.967 --> 21:21.085
will go into outer space,

21:21.141 --> 21:24.499
we will become like
other alien civilizations.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.672
Alien civilizations?

21:27.761 --> 21:31.899
How did a Russian math teacher,

21:32.054 --> 21:34.632
who grew up in a small village
in eastern Russia,

21:34.807 --> 21:36.677
come to believe that there were
other intelligent beings

21:36.701 --> 21:38.919
in the universe...

21:38.941 --> 21:41.339
and that it was
mankind's destiny

21:41.361 --> 21:43.859
to join them in the cosmos?

21:45.627 --> 21:48.165
The answer is simple.

21:48.321 --> 21:50.532
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,

21:50.687 --> 21:52.912
like millions of other Russians
of his day,

21:53.067 --> 21:56.679
subscribed to a philosophy
known as cosmism,

21:56.834 --> 21:59.392
which promoted
the idea that humanity

21:59.547 --> 22:03.059
has an ancient connection to
extraterrestrial beings.

22:03.214 --> 22:07.105
Russian cosmism began in the mid
and late 19th century.

22:07.107 --> 22:10.439
Within the traditions of cosmism
there are many who believe

22:10.594 --> 22:14.052
that our origins are actually
alien in nature,

22:14.207 --> 22:16.492
that is to say,
the human civilization

22:16.494 --> 22:18.352
is an alien transplant,

22:18.507 --> 22:20.079
and that, in going into space,

22:20.254 --> 22:21.999
we are actually going back home.

22:25.501 --> 22:27.012
From that perspective,

22:27.167 --> 22:28.552
it's very much in alignment

22:28.554 --> 22:29.670
with the ancient astronaut
theory

22:29.694 --> 22:32.325
where human beings strive

22:32.381 --> 22:34.172
to reconnect with these
ancient gods,

22:34.327 --> 22:38.439
through efforts like creating
a more advanced space program.

22:38.594 --> 22:41.092
What made Tsiolkovsky,
and others like him,

22:41.181 --> 22:43.672
so certain that aliens existed,

22:43.827 --> 22:47.419
and that space travel held
the key to humans reconnecting

22:47.574 --> 22:50.205
with these otherworldly beings?

22:50.261 --> 22:53.325
For the answer, ancient
astronaut theorists point

22:53.327 --> 22:55.212
to Tsiolkovsky's writings,

22:55.387 --> 22:57.099
in which he described

22:57.274 --> 22:59.545
extraterrestrial beings
sending messages

22:59.721 --> 23:03.752
and information to mankind
from the stars.

23:03.754 --> 23:07.259
He also wrote that he himself
had personally received

23:07.414 --> 23:11.039
a number of interplanetary
communications.

23:11.194 --> 23:12.772
Tsiolkovsky experienced

23:12.947 --> 23:16.065
tremendous sightings
in his life.

23:16.221 --> 23:19.412
One was in 1889.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.479
He was looking at the sky

23:21.634 --> 23:25.019
and all of a sudden he saw
a perfect cloud

23:25.194 --> 23:28.552
in the shape of
a four-pointed cross

23:28.707 --> 23:30.939
flying over him.

23:45.701 --> 23:47.559
He also felt

23:47.581 --> 23:50.119
that he was receiving
telepathic messages

23:50.274 --> 23:53.359
from, um, extraterrestrials.

23:53.361 --> 23:56.812
This leaves us to ponder
was he actually in contact

23:56.814 --> 23:59.245
with intelligences
from out there?

23:59.421 --> 24:01.179
Did they guide his hand?

24:01.221 --> 24:03.772
Did they supply this equation?

24:03.947 --> 24:06.092
Some of his models

24:06.101 --> 24:08.152
of what a spacecraft
would look like

24:08.154 --> 24:09.799
are very much in alignment

24:09.974 --> 24:12.125
with the descriptions
of various UFOs,

24:12.281 --> 24:14.599
this cigar elongated shape.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.945
Was he actually in communication

24:16.947 --> 24:19.159
with the beings that are
piloting these craft?

24:19.334 --> 24:21.939
Is it a vision that he got
showing how they manipulate

24:22.094 --> 24:24.119
and pilot these vehicles,

24:24.161 --> 24:25.792
and that's why he was able
to come up with such

24:25.794 --> 24:28.039
an accurate representation
for that model?

24:30.834 --> 24:32.805
For many ancient
astronaut theorists,

24:32.807 --> 24:35.839
Russia's widespread embrace
of cosmism

24:35.881 --> 24:38.825
might help explain why the
Soviet Union's reaction

24:38.827 --> 24:42.239
to the UFO incident
at Kapustin Yar

24:42.261 --> 24:44.732
was likely very different

24:44.734 --> 24:47.259
than the American military's
reaction to Roswell.

24:49.627 --> 24:53.145
The United States approached
the Space Race with an eye

24:53.147 --> 24:57.119
toward achieving scientific
and technological superiority.

24:57.141 --> 25:01.619
The Soviet Union seemed less
focused on technological goals,

25:01.774 --> 25:04.232
such as that of landing a man
on the Moon,

25:04.321 --> 25:06.732
and more interested
in using space travel

25:06.887 --> 25:08.819
as a means of realizing

25:08.974 --> 25:13.699
a kind of extraterrestrial
destiny.

25:13.854 --> 25:15.659
So the Space Race was really

25:15.814 --> 25:17.972
a cover for creating
new technologies

25:17.974 --> 25:19.732
in our defense industry.

25:19.841 --> 25:22.619
To create rockets
that could put large amounts

25:22.794 --> 25:25.672
of mass into space,
put a satellite into orbit.

25:25.761 --> 25:28.492
All these things required
technological developments

25:28.667 --> 25:30.792
that enabled spy satellites,

25:30.881 --> 25:34.179
that enabled communication
satellites.

25:34.334 --> 25:36.254
They enabled intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

25:39.094 --> 25:41.172
Russians were the first ones

25:41.281 --> 25:42.999
to promote this idea

25:43.154 --> 25:46.112
of unity between outer space

25:46.121 --> 25:48.579
and people on Earth.

25:48.621 --> 25:51.399
Tsiolkovsky knew there were

25:51.574 --> 25:53.405
other civilizations
in outer space,

25:53.407 --> 25:55.159
and he wanted to meet them.

25:55.314 --> 25:58.012
He put the seeds
in the minds of the people

25:58.167 --> 26:01.505
that helped develop rockets

26:01.661 --> 26:04.445
and space technology
in the Soviet Union.

26:04.601 --> 26:07.805
Maybe cosmism

26:07.807 --> 26:10.219
and then the Russian successes

26:10.374 --> 26:12.619
with Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin

26:12.641 --> 26:15.799
made the Americans realize
we need them.

26:15.974 --> 26:19.952
The Russians can do things
we can't do.

26:20.107 --> 26:23.672
They have a philosophical
outlook on this

26:23.674 --> 26:26.232
which gives them
an inherent advantage.

26:26.407 --> 26:28.919
And maybe in that sort
of situation,

26:28.941 --> 26:32.012
each party brings something
to the table.

26:32.121 --> 26:34.999
Could it be that when

26:35.041 --> 26:37.099
the Soviets launched Sputnik,

26:37.254 --> 26:39.565
it wasn't simply a show
of scientific superiority

26:39.621 --> 26:41.552
or military might,

26:41.554 --> 26:44.112
but an attempt
to directly connect

26:44.287 --> 26:46.919
with extraterrestrial beings?

26:46.921 --> 26:49.832
And, if so, could that have
motivated the United States

26:49.987 --> 26:52.492
to work more closely with them,

26:52.667 --> 26:55.425
and, ultimately,
partner with them?

26:55.427 --> 26:57.285
Perhaps further clues
can be found

26:57.441 --> 26:59.919
by examining what happened

26:59.921 --> 27:02.719
to the American
and Soviet space programs

27:02.894 --> 27:06.059
after the Soviet Union
collapsed.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.872
Moscow.

27:16.027 --> 27:18.819
Christmas Day, 1991.

27:18.994 --> 27:22.059
I am now concluding my activity

27:22.214 --> 27:24.739
as president of the USSR.

27:24.741 --> 27:26.845
In one of the most
significant events

27:26.847 --> 27:28.639
of the 20th century,

27:28.814 --> 27:30.985
Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev

27:31.141 --> 27:33.125
announces his resignation.

27:33.281 --> 27:37.092
Just five days short
of its 70th anniversary,

27:37.181 --> 27:39.739
the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics

27:39.761 --> 27:43.919
is officially dissolved.

27:43.921 --> 27:48.245
The Soviet Union collapsed 1989,
1990, 1991,

27:48.247 --> 27:51.212
and split up into
its constituent republics.

27:51.214 --> 27:54.385
Russia, at that time in
the 1990s, was a hellhole.

27:54.441 --> 27:56.845
Ethnic conflicts were brewing

27:57.001 --> 27:58.921
all around the borders of
the Russian Federation,

27:59.061 --> 28:01.379
incredibly high levels of crime,

28:01.534 --> 28:03.972
the birth of the Russian Mafia.

28:04.127 --> 28:06.612
But of all the problems

28:06.614 --> 28:09.245
that now plagued
the former Soviet Union,

28:09.247 --> 28:12.479
their space program
was not one of them.

28:12.634 --> 28:16.832
Their Mir orbiting space station
was considered a huge success,

28:16.921 --> 28:20.092
which often stood
in stark contrast

28:20.247 --> 28:23.679
to the United States'
tragedy-plagued Shuttle program.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.865
This contrast was so stark,
in fact,

28:30.867 --> 28:35.425
that when the Shuttle program
quietly ended in 2011,

28:35.481 --> 28:39.152
the United States suspended its
own manned space program

28:39.307 --> 28:42.412
in favor of sending
its astronauts up to

28:42.567 --> 28:45.085
the International Space Station
as little more than passengers

28:45.087 --> 28:48.539
aboard Russian <i> Soyuz</i> spacecraft.

28:48.541 --> 28:50.752
It seems
that the U.S. ceded control

28:50.841 --> 28:53.565
of space to the Russians,

28:53.641 --> 28:55.799
certainly in relation
to manned missions.

28:55.954 --> 28:57.752
But it is bizarre.

28:57.754 --> 28:59.472
For whatever reason,

28:59.481 --> 29:02.179
the Russians,
despite all their problems,

29:02.334 --> 29:05.612
seem to be ahead of the U.S.,
in some respects,

29:05.767 --> 29:07.745
when you talk about space.

29:07.921 --> 29:10.999
A couple of examples
of where the U.S. seem

29:11.021 --> 29:13.319
to have ceded control,

29:13.474 --> 29:15.399
or certainly ceded
the leadership position

29:15.554 --> 29:17.572
in space to the Russians,

29:17.581 --> 29:20.832
are the International
Space Station,

29:20.987 --> 29:24.165
where now, American astronauts
can't even get there

29:24.321 --> 29:27.505
without going up
in Russian rockets.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.999
For ancient astronaut theorists,

29:31.001 --> 29:32.959
the partnership between the two

29:33.114 --> 29:36.432
rival space programs
was simply an admission

29:36.434 --> 29:40.979
of what had already been taking
place in secret for decades.

29:41.021 --> 29:44.405
It also proved
that both the U.S.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.905
and Russian space programs

29:46.907 --> 29:48.859
were going to continue
working together

29:49.014 --> 29:51.625
in the interest
of furthering the goal

29:51.781 --> 29:54.525
of extraterrestrial contact.

29:54.527 --> 29:57.512
But this time
there was a difference:

29:57.687 --> 30:00.345
Russia was now
largely controlled

30:00.501 --> 30:02.639
by deep-pocketed oligarchs,

30:02.661 --> 30:06.879
and run by tight-gripped
autocrats like Vladimir Putin.

30:07.034 --> 30:09.559
They were free of the kind of
public scrutiny

30:09.581 --> 30:11.552
that would force full disclosure

30:11.554 --> 30:14.752
about just what they were doing
in outer space.

30:14.907 --> 30:17.852
If there are
alien-human encounters

30:17.854 --> 30:19.992
taking place in space
or in low Earth orbit,

30:20.167 --> 30:22.185
the Russians could bring back

30:22.341 --> 30:23.781
the information
and share it with us.

30:23.914 --> 30:26.759
There is a certain
level of secrecy

30:26.761 --> 30:28.905
that is very different
in Russia

30:28.907 --> 30:30.652
than it is in the United States.

30:30.807 --> 30:34.745
So it could be that most
sensitive information

30:34.747 --> 30:37.539
is being handled
by the Russian side

30:37.561 --> 30:40.439
so to make sure that it doesn't
get released

30:40.614 --> 30:43.085
and doesn't spook
the populations

30:43.087 --> 30:45.132
in different nations.

30:45.134 --> 30:48.932
But while information coming out

30:48.934 --> 30:51.965
of Russia is now under
tight control,

30:51.967 --> 30:54.545
the same could not be said
for the period

30:54.547 --> 30:56.945
when the Soviet Union
was imploding.

30:57.101 --> 30:59.772
And it was during
this brief period

30:59.774 --> 31:02.879
that Russia's extensive history
of extraterrestrial encounters

31:02.881 --> 31:06.105
became all but fully exposed.

31:06.261 --> 31:08.052
In the waning days
of the Soviet Union,

31:08.207 --> 31:10.385
a lot of interesting documents

31:10.387 --> 31:12.572
pertaining to UFOs
were declassified.

31:12.574 --> 31:15.745
For example,
the KGB, so-called Blue File,

31:15.821 --> 31:18.439
124 pages of information

31:18.594 --> 31:22.919
about UFO cases that came
within... to the KGB.

31:23.074 --> 31:24.859
It was declassified.

31:25.034 --> 31:27.265
We know that most of the
documents pertaining

31:27.421 --> 31:29.379
to the SETKA program,

31:29.554 --> 31:32.899
which was the official Soviet
top secret UFO program,

31:32.921 --> 31:36.492
which existed for 13 years,
from '78 to 1991,

31:36.581 --> 31:39.252
most of those cases
are not available,

31:39.407 --> 31:42.139
but the cases that we know
about, that I've studied,

31:42.294 --> 31:45.452
are enough
to make you amazed to know,

31:45.627 --> 31:47.539
and of what they have
discovered,

31:47.694 --> 31:49.599
and what may be in store.

31:49.601 --> 31:52.105
If the United States

31:52.107 --> 31:54.519
and the Soviet Union each
experienced decades

31:54.674 --> 31:57.352
of extraterrestrial contact,

31:57.441 --> 31:59.292
and had been secretly sharing
their experiences

31:59.294 --> 32:02.472
and information with each other,

32:02.474 --> 32:04.505
what is their ultimate agenda?

32:04.507 --> 32:08.932
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

32:09.107 --> 32:11.005
the answers can be found

32:11.007 --> 32:13.252
in recently revealed
Russian research

32:13.254 --> 32:15.939
that is intended to change
the human body,

32:15.961 --> 32:19.339
in order to prepare it
to travel the galaxy.

32:25.381 --> 32:27.359
Voronezh, Russia.

32:27.514 --> 32:32.059
September 27, 1989.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.239
A group of children
playing in a park

32:38.394 --> 32:41.585
witness a shining ball
in the sky that transforms

32:41.761 --> 32:45.719
into a disc-shaped craft
and lands nearby.

32:45.721 --> 32:49.299
They see strange beings emerge
from the craft,

32:49.454 --> 32:53.079
beings that do not appear
to be human.

32:54.281 --> 32:56.652
In the days after the encounter,

32:56.807 --> 33:00.719
as many as 30 other eyewitnesses
corroborate their account.

33:00.874 --> 33:03.099
Many people were out
and observed it,

33:03.274 --> 33:05.432
children as well as adults.

33:05.434 --> 33:08.939
Observers watched a hatch open

33:08.961 --> 33:12.005
and two beings come out,

33:12.007 --> 33:15.619
a very tall one
and a modest-sized one.

33:15.641 --> 33:19.579
The tall one was described as,
um, rather mechanical-looking

33:19.734 --> 33:21.345
but a being

33:21.501 --> 33:24.752
that estimates were from nine
to 12 feet tall.

33:24.754 --> 33:26.839
The small one
looked like a robot.

33:26.861 --> 33:30.232
Both were distinguished
by very small heads.

33:30.321 --> 33:33.039
They began
to move about the park.

33:33.194 --> 33:34.699
People reacted.

33:34.854 --> 33:38.092
One report has a boy in shock...

33:38.094 --> 33:40.799
the taller being pointing
an apparatus at the boy

33:40.954 --> 33:42.779
and freezing him.

33:42.934 --> 33:47.012
He was reactivated, so to say,
before the craft took off.

33:47.167 --> 33:49.399
This is one of these cases

33:49.421 --> 33:52.352
where there are
so many witnesses

33:52.354 --> 33:54.259
and they have
all been interviewed

33:54.434 --> 33:56.712
and they're just all sincere.

33:56.714 --> 33:58.632
They all saw something.

33:58.634 --> 34:01.419
Some of the witnesses definitely
described those things

34:01.441 --> 34:04.185
as artificial-looking
and mechanical.

34:04.187 --> 34:07.505
Well, we, ourselves, seem
to be moving in that direction.

34:07.507 --> 34:10.705
Are we creating ourselves as
synthetic beings in the future?

34:10.706 --> 34:12.532
And the answer is
we sure may be.

34:12.687 --> 34:14.418
That's the way
it seems to be going.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.972
If there are
extraterrestrial beings

34:19.127 --> 34:21.418
visiting Earth,

34:21.574 --> 34:25.052
is it possible that
they are not biological like us

34:25.054 --> 34:27.812
but have adopted
synthetic bodies

34:27.813 --> 34:31.339
better suited
for traveling the cosmos?

34:31.494 --> 34:34.045
And if so, might humanity

34:34.047 --> 34:35.585
be forced to do the same

34:35.641 --> 34:39.079
in order to travel
into deep space?

34:39.101 --> 34:43.025
Many scientists believe this
to be the case,

34:43.027 --> 34:44.632
and there is a growing movement
in Russia

34:44.741 --> 34:46.458
to take the first steps

34:46.481 --> 34:49.018
of this transformation.

34:53.687 --> 34:56.065
Moscow.

34:56.067 --> 34:59.712
February 2012.

34:59.867 --> 35:04.379
Russian billionaire
Dmitry Itskov brings together

35:04.534 --> 35:08.365
over 50 leading scientists
to discuss what he believes

35:08.421 --> 35:11.359
is the next step
in human evolution,

35:11.381 --> 35:13.459
immortality.

35:16.007 --> 35:18.199
Through his ambitious project,

35:18.354 --> 35:20.505
called the 2045 Initiative,

35:20.561 --> 35:23.545
Itskov hopes
to create technology

35:23.601 --> 35:26.345
that would ultimately upload
the human brain

35:26.401 --> 35:30.399
into a computer
by the year 2045.

35:30.554 --> 35:33.959
The 2045 Initiative,
it really is a call

35:33.981 --> 35:36.452
to bring minds together
to solve the problem

35:36.461 --> 35:38.872
of, essentially, digitizing
a human being.

35:38.874 --> 35:41.332
And in that case,
you could download it.

35:41.341 --> 35:43.225
You could, uh, transfer it
to another source.

35:43.301 --> 35:45.999
You could allow it
to go into space.

35:49.761 --> 35:52.799
They want
to make human being immortal,

35:52.801 --> 35:56.332
being that can explore farthest
reaches of the universe.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.972
To me, this exactly ties in

35:59.127 --> 36:01.759
with what the Russian,
uh, philosophers

36:01.934 --> 36:03.679
and scientists talked about

36:03.854 --> 36:06.099
in the beginning
of the 20th century,

36:06.274 --> 36:10.412
Russian cosmism.

36:10.414 --> 36:13.799
In this, we hear echoes
of the vision of Tsiolkovsky.

36:13.821 --> 36:16.392
He told us
that he was in contact

36:16.501 --> 36:18.025
with extraterrestrial beings.

36:18.081 --> 36:19.765
He specifically noted
that they were,

36:19.821 --> 36:21.799
in fact, light beings.

36:21.821 --> 36:24.219
So, is it possible
that what we are doing

36:24.221 --> 36:25.765
is catching up with his vision,

36:25.841 --> 36:28.685
that, if we create
avatar humans,

36:28.761 --> 36:31.779
are we, in fact, then recreating
the extraterrestrials

36:31.801 --> 36:34.899
who originally connected
with him?

36:35.054 --> 36:37.339
Who knows if the Russians
could actually achieve

36:37.494 --> 36:38.952
this 2045 Initiative,

36:39.127 --> 36:41.312
but they are thinking about it.

36:41.467 --> 36:45.032
And they don't seem to be upset
with the process that's planned.

36:45.034 --> 36:46.952
The United States,
on the other hand,

36:46.954 --> 36:48.739
wouldn't even consider
such an idea.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.859
Doing experiments on a human

36:52.014 --> 36:54.552
of transplanting a brain
into a robot

36:54.661 --> 36:56.837
is probably gonna take a lot
of approval and a long time

36:56.861 --> 36:59.099
for anyone to sign on to that.

36:59.254 --> 37:01.732
But is it the same
if you were in Russia?

37:01.734 --> 37:04.185
Their system of government
is a little different,

37:04.341 --> 37:06.805
and they might do experiments
like that

37:06.881 --> 37:09.299
easier than the United States.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.459
In the U.S. and in the West,

37:12.614 --> 37:14.025
it is perhaps

37:14.181 --> 37:16.919
a long, hard journey
to convince people

37:17.094 --> 37:18.705
that these things
should be done.

37:18.861 --> 37:21.365
Maybe we will never
convince them.

37:21.541 --> 37:24.332
But in Russia, through cosmism,

37:24.334 --> 37:26.412
through transhumanism,

37:26.414 --> 37:28.212
as the Russians practice it,

37:28.321 --> 37:30.345
you're trying to do things

37:30.401 --> 37:35.219
that Russians already believe in
and aspire to.

37:35.241 --> 37:37.812
There's real benefit to the U.S.

37:37.967 --> 37:41.259
in making the Russians
our partners.

37:41.281 --> 37:45.025
Is it possible that humanity,

37:45.081 --> 37:48.119
led by the United States
and Russia,

37:48.121 --> 37:51.565
is poised to take bold steps
into deep space?

37:51.721 --> 37:53.565
If so,

37:53.621 --> 37:56.832
is this escalation
limited to space travel

37:56.921 --> 37:59.912
or might it also include
something like

38:00.021 --> 38:03.219
a military space force?

38:08.501 --> 38:10.219
The White House.

38:10.394 --> 38:13.272
June 18, 2018.

38:13.427 --> 38:17.619
At a meeting
of the National Space Council,

38:17.661 --> 38:21.012
President Donald J. Trump
calls on the Pentagon

38:21.014 --> 38:23.872
to develop a sixth branch
of the United States military,

38:23.874 --> 38:26.085
a space force.

38:26.087 --> 38:28.112
I'm hereby directing

38:28.201 --> 38:32.145
the Department of Defense
and Pentagon to establish

38:32.201 --> 38:34.205
a space force

38:34.207 --> 38:38.165
as the sixth branch
of the armed forces.

38:38.341 --> 38:40.119
That's a big statement.

38:40.121 --> 38:43.785
The stunning news
was followed ten days later

38:43.841 --> 38:46.085
by the announcement
that President Trump

38:46.141 --> 38:48.932
and Russian President
Vladimir Putin

38:49.107 --> 38:51.472
would have a private,
behind-closed-doors meeting

38:51.627 --> 38:53.739
the following month.

38:53.781 --> 38:57.105
Is it possible that
these two high-profile events

38:57.261 --> 38:59.919
were strategically related?

39:00.074 --> 39:02.279
If both nations are aware

39:02.434 --> 39:03.870
that there is
an extraterrestrial presence

39:03.894 --> 39:06.139
and that it is
potentially hostile,

39:06.161 --> 39:09.972
then cooperation
is the only route to go.

39:09.974 --> 39:12.219
It's the only way
that we could actually achieve

39:12.374 --> 39:14.672
some sort of mutual defense
of the planet Earth.

39:14.827 --> 39:18.145
This one-on-one between Trump

39:18.221 --> 39:22.245
and Putin may just be
the latest in a long line

39:22.401 --> 39:25.465
of secret,
high-level communications

39:25.621 --> 39:27.219
between the world leaders.

39:27.374 --> 39:30.292
And it may be that things

39:30.467 --> 39:33.159
like the creation
of the space force

39:33.181 --> 39:35.732
show that there's been
an escalation.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.439
Well, the reason
you create a force

39:37.441 --> 39:40.119
of any kind
is to deal with a threat.

39:40.274 --> 39:43.099
- Liftoff.
- We're reaching a point

39:43.101 --> 39:45.639
in our civilization here
on Earth that we're beginning

39:45.814 --> 39:48.992
to send probes
and... maybe even soon... people

39:49.167 --> 39:50.799
throughout the solar system,

39:50.821 --> 39:52.579
maybe even into deeper space.

39:54.881 --> 39:57.285
It's quite possible
the space force

39:57.461 --> 40:00.805
could be set up in an outpost
in case there was

40:00.807 --> 40:03.585
some incident on Mars
or in the asteroid belt

40:03.587 --> 40:06.419
or at Jupiter
or way out at the Kuiper belt.

40:10.061 --> 40:11.837
As far
as ancient astronaut theorists

40:11.861 --> 40:13.259
are concerned,

40:13.434 --> 40:15.705
the U.S.-Russia relationship
in space

40:15.881 --> 40:19.272
is the direct result
of an extraordinary agenda

40:19.427 --> 40:22.085
not on the part of world leaders

40:22.261 --> 40:25.179
but by an extraterrestrial
intelligence,

40:25.354 --> 40:28.492
an intelligence that believes
that each nation

40:28.581 --> 40:30.659
has the unique ability
to complement

40:30.661 --> 40:33.259
the other's strengths
and weaknesses

40:33.281 --> 40:35.985
and that outer space
should be explored

40:36.141 --> 40:37.725
not as a function of competition

40:37.801 --> 40:42.025
but as the result
of mankind's shared need

40:42.027 --> 40:44.652
to fulfill its ultimate destiny.

40:44.654 --> 40:47.859
It seems that Russia and America

40:48.014 --> 40:51.192
have been inextricably bound
together

40:51.194 --> 40:55.219
in this Space Race,

40:55.374 --> 40:59.932
a space race run, perhaps,
not between nations

40:59.934 --> 41:03.905
but with nations
racing alongside each other.

41:03.907 --> 41:05.612
In actuality,

41:05.621 --> 41:08.572
the, uh, idea of Space Race
is not correct,

41:08.727 --> 41:11.772
because there were n-never
Space Race.

41:11.861 --> 41:14.079
There was cooperation

41:14.234 --> 41:17.112
which had to be kept secret
for a while.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.392
But sooner or later,

41:19.547 --> 41:22.159
you could see fruits
of such cooperation.

41:22.161 --> 41:26.345
We actually have
to work together

41:26.501 --> 41:28.812
and explore together
and cooperate together

41:28.814 --> 41:31.632
to prevent any danger to Earth.

41:31.787 --> 41:35.232
As humans prepare
for their journey

41:35.234 --> 41:38.279
to Mars and beyond,

41:38.434 --> 41:41.419
they will become
the extraterrestrial visitors

41:41.574 --> 41:43.152
of other worlds.

41:43.161 --> 41:46.819
And if ancient astronaut
theorists are correct,

41:46.974 --> 41:50.599
their journey will have been
aided by alien visitors

41:50.754 --> 41:54.919
who see our planet not
as a number of warring nations

41:54.961 --> 41:58.092
but as a launching pad

41:58.094 --> 42:01.932
filled with people
eager to explore

42:01.934 --> 42:05.279
an amazing universe.
