You know me, just workin' on workin'.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.350
How long you in town?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.646
Yeah? When you tryin' to get together?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.858
Hey, tonight is perfect. It's perfect.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.819
No, because me and Rodney,
we have this VIP section

02:32.903 --> 02:34.863
at the Red Star Lounge.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.573
Ah, it's a nice little spot, man.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.243
Nice little intimate...
It's like a Buddha Lounge.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.205
Good music, a little jazz, R&B,
you know, light music.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.458
Good food...

02:46.542 --> 02:49.461
Oh, and the women...
Oh, man.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.297
Got some of the best women
in Chicago come through.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.385
W-Well, things have changed
since the last time I talked to you, man.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.512
Yeah, Dana and I are going
through that little divorce.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.223
I really don't wanna talk about it, but...

03:02.182 --> 03:03.725
Yeah, it's going on eight months now,

03:03.809 --> 03:08.689
but trust when I tell you...
I am so much in a better place.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
Trust me.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.943
So, with that being said,

03:13.277 --> 03:15.946
you should not bring
your wife out tonight.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.447
Leave her in the hotel.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.576
No, it's just the guys going out.
Just me, you, and Rodney.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.827
My man.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.245
You can't get away for two hours?

03:25.080 --> 03:25.998
Two hours?

03:27.666 --> 03:29.668
All right, look,
I'm gonna text you the address.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.753
If you can come through,
we would love to see you.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.672
If not, we'll see you tomorrow.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.384
All right, okay, big dawg. Yeah.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.928
- Who that was?
- It's your boy Brian, man.

03:40.012 --> 03:44.516
Ho, man!
We ain't heard from him in years!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.727
- A minute, right?
- Wow, yeah.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.896
Yeah, he's in town
on business, you know,

03:48.979 --> 03:50.480
but the man brought his wife.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.150
- Who does that?
- Who does that?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.569
- Why would you do that?
- Why <i>would </i> you do that?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.487
- I don't... It's ridic--
- You know what?

03:57.571 --> 04:01.074
I take that back,
I do know who does <i>that: </i> you.

04:01.158 --> 04:05.287
'Cause I can think of a few occasions
where you took wifey on business trips.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.291
Okay, okay, well, that was then.
This is now.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.919
- Not doing that no more, right?
- All right, all right. Okay.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.338
It's the new you. All right.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.173
But you know he not
coming out tonight, right?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.884
Probably not, but more for us,
you know how we do.

04:18.966 --> 04:24.014
Yeah, and it was crackin' last week, man.
It was poppin' last week.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.308
And tonight it's gonna be even poppin'-er.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.519
- Poppin'-er?
- Poppin'-er.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.562
That means more poppin'
than the last time, man.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.563
It's gonna be on!

04:31.647 --> 04:35.150
- You're a wild boy, man.
- Shit, that's what I'm sayin', bro.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.445
Oh, speaking of which, man,
I'm taking a test...

04:38.904 --> 04:43.283
for the state broker's license
this weekend, man.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.245
You know how hard that test is, man?
You sure you're ready for it?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.205
Yeah, yeah, look, eh, listen.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.666
I did the webinars, the seminars,

04:50.749 --> 04:53.168
the reading, the Googling,
and everything else, man.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.503
I'm ready!

04:54.586 --> 04:57.464
Besides, bro, I didn't quit
the police force

04:57.548 --> 04:59.633
just to start real estate and fail, man.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.178
And we gotta talk
about that partnership, too.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.851
Hey, I'm your best sales agent.
Have been since day one, man.

05:08.934 --> 05:13.230
And you said, once I get my license,
we'd discuss the partnership, remember?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.483
Open up a second office,
I'd fix it up, I'd run it.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.028
- That's what we were doin'.
- Okay. Right. You're right.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.197
So get your license.
Maybe we'll talk about it.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.991
Oh, that's happening Saturday, bruh.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.367
Yeah?

05:25.784 --> 05:29.329
Well, till that mystical, magical,
majestical day happens,

05:29.413 --> 05:30.455
you still work for me.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.625
Yeah, that's right, I do work for you.
Speaking of which,

05:33.709 --> 05:37.546
I had a closing this morning,
and I'm heading out for a double closing.

05:38.213 --> 05:42.134
Yeah. You know what, y'all need to start
calling me "the closer" around here.

05:42.217 --> 05:46.388
Because I close shit...
even more than you, bruh.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.140
- Oh, more than me?
- Yes.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.602
Okay. All right, well, look, man.
I do want you as a partner, okay?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.978
It's not like I don't.

05:53.061 --> 05:57.065
All right, and you are my man and you are
my top salesman, that's true.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.568
So why would I not want you as my partner?

05:59.651 --> 06:02.321
But you gotta get your license, man,
okay, and when that happens,

06:02.404 --> 06:05.407
I promise you, seriously, we will talk.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.783
- My man.
- Get your license.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.410
- I'll see you tonight.
- All right, big dawg.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.537
Hey!
It'll be like Santa Claus in there.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.081
Ho ho ho! Ha!

06:13.165 --> 06:14.708
Puttin' them ho's in the bag, man.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.606
Honey, I'm home.
How you doin'?

06:37.981 --> 06:41.026
I would be better if I didn't
have to wake up

06:41.109 --> 06:43.987
and clean your clothes
off my living room floor.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.032
I gave you the guest room.
Why don't you sleep in there?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.576
Because I told you that that mattress
hurts my back,

06:49.660 --> 06:52.538
and I like to sleep with the TV on;
there's no TV in there.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.501
I am not gonna keep cleanin' up after you.
You know?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.961
When are you moving out?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.923
- You really upset?
- Yeah. You think I'm joking?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.801
Look, I told you, the attorney said
I cannot buy any more property

07:05.884 --> 07:08.637
until after the divorce.
How many times I gotta tell you that?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.640
Yeah, well, I keep hoping
that the answer changes.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.101
- I'm hoping it does, too.
- Yeah!

07:14.434 --> 07:17.271
You know what, you're taking this
"best friend" thing a little too far.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.897
- I'm not, I'm sorry.
- Yes, you are.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.650
You have another best friend: Rodney.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.820
Matter of fact, why don't you go back
there and move with your mama?

07:25.237 --> 07:27.656
- My mama?
- Yeah, your mama will take you back.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.992
- She'll put up with this mess.
- What do I look like

07:30.075 --> 07:32.077
- living with my mama, huh?
- Huh.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.246
As far as Rodney goes,
you know, he never cleans up.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.790
Look who's talking.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.625
Look, this is an experimentation thing.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.587
I'm trying to see how it is to live
and not do nothin'.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.881
- No, come on, stop, stop!
- See, see how that happen?

07:43.964 --> 07:47.092
- You know you love me.
- No, I don't, I can't stand you.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.636
- You love me.
- No.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.889
- And I'm leavin' out again tonight.
- Really?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.433
Yeah, well, the life
of a flight attendant.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.644
Wow. So the life
of a flight attendant, huh?

07:57.728 --> 07:59.146
Yeah, well, you know.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.522
So when you gonna be back?

08:00.606 --> 08:04.860
I don't know, but in the meantime,
I need you to clean up my house

08:04.943 --> 08:06.236
- and stop playing.
- Okay, okay.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.030
- Hey, pony tail, knock it off.
- Whatever.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.573
Yeah. I'm gonna clean up.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.576
I'll have it all done before the time
you fly out, all right?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.286
Pierre, come on, stop playing.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.497
- I'm serious, I'll get it, all right.
- All right. I gotta get outta here.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.249
All right, get up outta here.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.881
See you when you get back.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.265
- Damn, you smell good!
- PLP.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.018
- Eh?
- Hey!

08:38.101 --> 08:40.604
- Hey, man!
- Oops. Man, I'm just sayin'.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.523
Ohh!

08:42.606 --> 08:45.192
- Country wealth, I can't take him nowhere.
- Mm!

08:45.275 --> 08:47.945
Ooh! Ah, hey!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.906
It is a lot of ladies
in here tonight, man.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.450
- Yeah, there is.
- Hella women in here tonight, man.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.870
So many women in here, I'm already
looking forward to <i>next </i> week.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.289
- Hey!
- You and me both, dawg, it's a nice spot.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.917
Hey, I think I'm gonna
take me home two tonight.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.126
Maybe even three.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.047
Yeah, two or three's not bad,
but all I need is that one right there.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.550
Where, who? What you talking about?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.510
See that short little hot pocket
at the bar?

09:11.593 --> 09:14.263
Ooh, man,
she look like watermelon.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.973
I like watermelon.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.474
- Yeah, I like it too.
- Mmm!

09:17.558 --> 09:20.227
Man, I might have
to get that first, though.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.313
You gonna get that one first,
the one I saw come through the door first?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.398
- What?
- Huh?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.276
Let me show you how this is done, man.
Uh, waitress...

09:28.569 --> 09:29.695
Waitress.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.699
See that woman right over there?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.534
That little beige dress,
little sexy somethin'?

09:36.827 --> 09:39.872
Get her a bottle of whatever she wants.
Let her know it's from me.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.832
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.918
- Sure think so. Look at this.
- Ooh, man!

09:45.002 --> 09:47.921
- That works here?
- Golly! Man!

09:48.005 --> 09:50.424
Boy.
Eh, but a whole bottle, though?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
- Yeah.
- Trippin', man.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.802
What happened to one drink at a time?

09:53.886 --> 09:55.345
'Cause we got money now, man.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.848
I'm trying something a little different,
a little classy, and...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.309
she hasn't looked over here all night,
so that's gonna make her look over here.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.477
Unless she's a drunken, selfish...

10:02.561 --> 10:05.272
"All right, thank you."
Just keep on drinking.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.816
I'd get her one drink,
get her over here, and get her out.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.693
Boom, bam, bing.
That's how I'd do.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.278
You got money now, man.
Why you so cheap?

10:11.361 --> 10:13.906
I ain't cheap, man.
You too nice.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.576
That was your problem in your marriage.
That's why you got played, man.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.329
Okay, you're right,
but the joke is on her.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.123
'Cause she can't get around
that prenup, understand?

10:23.207 --> 10:24.833
I'm not talking
about the money, man,

10:24.917 --> 10:27.127
I'm talking about the fact
that she cheated on you, bro.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.087
You got played.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.632
Damn, you're right,
but that won't happen again.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.176
All right, 'cause now I just date 'em.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.638
I let 'em know up front what it's
gonna be, and that's what it's gonna be.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.181
- So you're just in and out.
- In and out.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.933
- Like the burger...
- The burger joint.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.309
What's up, my boy?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.228
Mm!

10:44.311 --> 10:47.147
Mm! Oh. See what I'm saying?
Look at that.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.858
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.489
Thought we'd come over here and share.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.451
Mm. Well, I'd like to share with you two.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.828
- Is that right?
- That is right.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.373
I'm just... saying what I mean,
that's all.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.333
- I like that.
- Oh, you like that?

11:06.416 --> 11:07.334
I do.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.711
Okay, all right, okay.
All right.

11:09.795 --> 11:14.091
Do you mind giving us a moment, please?
I want you to come back, though.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.761
Ahh. Yeah, you wearin' that.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.431
Oh... Hi, big red.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.766
Big red!

11:22.850 --> 11:25.727
- Come on over here, girl!
- Big red in the building and...

11:26.103 --> 11:27.020
Tall stick of gum. Mm.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.564
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.275
All right, what you get?
See what you chose, huh?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.277
Oh, my... Mmm.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.821
Mm, you know my daddy own Nestlé Crunch.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.198
- But I've got the best bar in my pocket.
- Waitress.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.411
Hey, I told her my daddy
owned Nestlé Crunch

11:42.494 --> 11:44.955
and I got a special candy bar
for her in my jeans.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.124
Hey, look.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.128
- Can I get four glasses, please?
- Oh, my God, Lord! Ohh!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.588
- She got a lot, man.
- Oh, my God.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.298
- Get one more for you, too.
- Yeah.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.340
I want you to join us.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.759
- Hey, it's crackin' in here, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.554
- Big red, like fire. Like the devil.
- Okay, I see.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.896
Good morning, sunshine.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.193
Good morning, sunshine.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.319
Mm-hmm.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.906
Hey.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.784
- Oh, what...
- Ahh.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.369
What's all that?

12:24.453 --> 12:27.206
I figured I'd fix you up a little
something before you go to work.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.791
- Really?
- After all that liquor we drank.

12:31.126 --> 12:35.047
Well, thank you for that, but I just...
can't eat that right now.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.508
- I got a headache. Oh!
- Hmm.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.803
- I have the perfect thing for that.
- No, no.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.431
So, you mean to tell me
you don't want another dose

12:44.515 --> 12:46.058
of the surprise
I had for you last night?

12:46.141 --> 12:47.518
Oh, a surprise, huh?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.353
Uh-huh.
Something like that.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.147
What was that?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.566
So you don't remember?

12:55.359 --> 12:57.027
You know, honestly,
I don't remember anything.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.364
I don't remember how much I drank,
what happened.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.617
So, you don't remember my friend
being here with us last night?

13:06.328 --> 13:07.871
- That girl in the red?
- Uh-huh.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.039
And where is she?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.250
I had to put her out
in the living room on the sofa.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.419
She was snoring too loud.
I already had to deal with your snoring.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.547
- Oh, I was snoring.
- Yeah, you were snoring.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.714
Okay.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.468
- But I can go get her, if you want me to.
- You know what, that's quite all right

13:21.552 --> 13:23.804
'cause, like I said,
I have to get to work.

13:23.887 --> 13:28.308
So, why don't you and your girl
get your things?

13:28.392 --> 13:29.518
I have to get to work.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.562
So maybe we'll hook up again later?

13:31.645 --> 13:34.481
I do remember saying
this was a one-time thing.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.235
You said "No strings."
You said nothing about one time.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.821
Well, that's pretty much the same thing.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.408
- That's okay.
- Okay.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.993
- I'm cool with that.
- You're cool with that?

13:46.076 --> 13:49.204
I had a good time.
And it was well worth it.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.123
Well, I'm sure it was well worth it.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.624
Oh, you're sure about that, huh?

13:52.708 --> 13:57.462
Well, yeah, I mean, if a woman makes
a man some... some flapjacks...

13:57.546 --> 13:59.798
- Yeah.
- ...cheese eggs and a little bacon...

13:59.882 --> 14:02.384
- Hooked that up.
- I did a damn thing, too.

14:02.467 --> 14:07.890
Yes, Pierre Jackson.
It was amazing.

14:10.184 --> 14:13.061
- Bye.
- Goodbye, short-stack.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.647
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's your name?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.358
- Really?
- No, no disrespect.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.777
I told you I don't remember
anything, right?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.196
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.948
- Don't forget it, either.
- I'll try not to, Ms. Raquel.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.076
- Bye, Pierre.
- All right, Raquel.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.628
Wait... make sure she leave.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.392
Man, I cannot believe

14:52.476 --> 14:55.145
you got to go home
with both of them, man.

14:55.229 --> 14:58.398
Big red was s'posed to be with me,
old pill-head heifer.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.860
Hey... My apologies, man.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.780
Little short-stack brought her through.
I mean, I don't know, man.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.281
I don't even remember what happened.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.367
You don't remember anything, man?

15:08.450 --> 15:10.744
- No.
- I would have remembered everything, dawg,

15:10.827 --> 15:13.121
even if I was drinking
much as you was, huh.

15:13.497 --> 15:17.209
I'm feeling this right now, man.
It's like, it's just bad, man.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.295
I mean, they had me, we were smokin' weed,

15:20.379 --> 15:21.713
they had some molly.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.341
- Ohhh!
- And, you know,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.218
- never did that before.
- Hey, man.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.263
Know what I'm saying?
If it wasn't for this meeting, man, today,

15:29.346 --> 15:31.390
I'd have stayed in the bed, bruh.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.017
Man, man, man, man, man.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.020
Bruh... Damn.

15:37.855 --> 15:41.066
Hey, listen, man, I don't know
how much you was drinkin',

15:41.149 --> 15:44.111
but you was knockin' 'em down
left and right, man.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.446
- Mm.
- You might wanna slow down

15:46.530 --> 15:47.573
a little bit on the Goose.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.076
Oh, really? Oh, okay,
because I had a little cognac,

15:51.159 --> 15:54.329
had the Goose for the women,
so now you sayin'... I'm a alcoholic.

15:54.413 --> 15:57.499
Hey, listen, I ain't sayin' all that,
but what I'm sayin' is,

15:57.583 --> 16:00.210
when you wake up in bed
with two bad broads

16:00.294 --> 16:03.338
and you don't remember how they got there
or what you did,

16:03.422 --> 16:06.008
it might be time to slow down
on the liquor, man.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.551
Especially nowadays, man.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.595
These little broads be slick, man.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.096
You never know.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.807
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.936
You're right, but...
I don't think so with these two.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.899
Nigga. You don't remember
anything that happened.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.193
What do you mean,
you think it was cool, bro?

16:24.276 --> 16:27.613
Eh, listen, that alone,
that you don't remember nothing,

16:27.696 --> 16:31.116
lets me know that they could have slipped
something in your drink or anything, man.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.495
No, no. Because little short-stack
made me breakfast, man.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.999
She made me some pancakes
with cheese eggs.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.710
- Cheese eggs, those hash browns...
- Oh, yeah, that is...

16:41.793 --> 16:44.296
I do remember that,
you know what I'm saying, so--

16:44.379 --> 16:47.549
And, when everything was over
and I finished eating, I said,

16:47.633 --> 16:49.843
"I gotta go to work," there was no drama.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.720
They just packed up and left.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.098
They ain't try to stay, like,
"Why can't I stay and chill?"

16:55.182 --> 16:57.476
They left, man. It was good.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.020
- Man, I done created a monster.
- Yeah.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.105
You're a monster.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.273
Monster that don't remember, but hold on.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.442
Yeah, what's up, Karen?

17:05.526 --> 17:07.861
Mrs. Jackson is here to see you.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.446
Are you serious?

17:10.531 --> 17:11.656
Mm-hmm.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.117
- What's she doing here?
- Yeah, man.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.121
Man, you know I ain't seen her
since... I left, man.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.374
- Hmm-mm.
- Let her know I'll be there.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.500
I'm coming out.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.670
No problem, Mr. Jackson, I am going
to head out also; talk to you soon.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.171
All right.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.048
Tell Karen I'll be out there, too.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.051
Gonna see what she's talkin' about.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.973
You better watch what kind of ho's
you sleep with, man.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.725
Sound like they pussy was bad and bougie.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.067
What is it, Dana?

17:48.068 --> 17:51.822
Pierre.
You're looking good these days.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.950
What are you doing here?

17:55.325 --> 17:58.161
You don't have to be so candid.
Look, I need to talk to you.

17:58.704 --> 18:01.206
Okay.
Talk to my attorney.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.001
- Look--
- Get your hands off of me.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.670
Ohh!
You're so cute.

18:07.296 --> 18:10.883
I'm just trying to speed up this divorce.
It'll just take five minutes.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.178
Five minutes.

18:24.146 --> 18:28.483
So you contest the prenup by saying
you signed it under duress.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.568
That was clever.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.738
Not true, of course, as you know,
but clever.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.199
You really do look good.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.160
Different, I may add, but...
you look good.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.789
I came here in person because
you haven't taken any of my calls.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.875
Good, so we can get
to the bottom of this divorce now.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.504
- I'm getting to that.
- You've got five minutes to get to that.

18:48.587 --> 18:51.507
First I wanna know, when did you become
playboy of the millennium?

18:52.174 --> 18:54.384
- What are you talking about?
- I've been hearing about you turning up

18:54.468 --> 18:55.886
every Tuesday
at the Red Star Lounge.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.763
Oh, now you're spying on me.

18:57.846 --> 19:01.016
I don't have to spy on you.
I know people who hang out there, too.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.561
- So?
- So, I would think that you would wait

19:04.645 --> 19:07.022
until our divorce is final
before seeing other people.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.983
Oh, really?
And why would I do that?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.110
'Cause <i>you </i> didn't wait, did you?

19:12.653 --> 19:15.155
Huh? What I thought.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.744
I know I messed up really bad this time,
and I'm sorry for hurting you.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.248
I can never take back what I did,
but can we at least try to be cordial?

19:24.331 --> 19:30.212
Under the circumstances,
this is as cordial as it's gonna get.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.673
Oh, please.

19:32.756 --> 19:39.346
So, you have, uh, three minutes.
Get to this divorce.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.431
I know you missed me, Pierre.

19:44.393 --> 19:45.936
And now I know you missed me.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.814
Hey, stop, all right?

19:49.648 --> 19:51.650
- Not today, it's not gonna work.
- What won't work?

19:51.733 --> 19:54.361
You trying to come on to me.
It's not going to work.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.322
- It's not gonna happen.
- I know you still love me, Pierre.

19:57.406 --> 19:58.699
And as I said,

19:58.782 --> 20:00.784
I can never take back for cheating on you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.037
But can you just make love to me
this one time?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.290
Oh, sit down, sit down!

20:10.752 --> 20:12.462
I wanna make you understand
the magnitude

20:13.088 --> 20:15.549
of why I'm done with you, okay?

20:17.843 --> 20:20.596
Now, we said we were
soulmates, right?

20:20.679 --> 20:22.848
Each other's everything.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.725
That one in a million.

20:26.810 --> 20:31.106
From the ninth grade when I saw you,
I said, "I wanna marry her."

20:32.274 --> 20:35.569
And I did. And it took me
through years of drama.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.281
With your lies, manipulation.

20:39.364 --> 20:42.367
Because I was so in love with you.

20:43.035 --> 20:45.162
Had to act like it wasn't happening.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.749
Or just dealt with it,
'cause I loved you so much.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.545
But to go to my house, in my bed,
to see my wife...

20:53.629 --> 20:55.088
Look at me!

20:56.298 --> 20:57.758
Sucking...

20:57.841 --> 21:00.219
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

21:01.470 --> 21:02.679
Sucking dick.

21:05.557 --> 21:09.394
So all this rage and all this anger
I have for you,

21:09.978 --> 21:11.939
that has replaced that love.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.652
And I don't care about you no more.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.321
I really don't.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.491
And since you're not
coming here for the divorce...

21:23.617 --> 21:24.952
I'll see you in court.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.873
Fine, Pierre, I'll go.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.251
You're probably
sleeping with Phenix, anyway.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.961
She was always in love with you, right?

21:34.044 --> 21:36.672
- I'll see you in court.
- No, I'll see <i>you </i> in court.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.110
Ah, that's good shit.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.362
Good shit, congratulations, big dawg.

22:06.577 --> 22:11.874
See... that is when you lose with me.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.086
Ending transaction.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.924
Hey, bestie!

22:21.008 --> 22:22.593
Hey-hey-hey!

22:22.676 --> 22:25.804
I see my house still looks
a hot-ass mess.

22:26.638 --> 22:30.475
Well, as you also can see,
I'm cleaning up, right?

22:30.851 --> 22:31.810
Huh?

22:31.894 --> 22:34.730
You look like you haven't
cleaned up since I left.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.317
It seems like
the more and more I clean up,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.861
the more and more... gets messed up.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.446
But...

22:42.529 --> 22:44.656
Yeah, you know what,
I can't with you right now.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.366
I'm gonna go take a shower.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.951
Well, take your shower.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.120
Look like a fake ass
<i>Catch Me If You Can.</i>

22:50.204 --> 22:52.664
Shut your mouth, negro.
Clean up my house.

22:53.582 --> 22:56.335
- Yeah.
- Get off my couch.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.795
Anyway...

22:58.879 --> 23:02.299
No, not for the hype.
I love Westbrook before all that.

23:02.382 --> 23:06.220
'Cause he's harassin' the assassins,
like Jordan, Iverson, Kobe.

23:06.929 --> 23:10.098
Really, P, you've been having
sex in my bed?

23:10.182 --> 23:11.767
Let me call you back, bro.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.769
Yeah, call whoever
you were talking to back.

23:15.562 --> 23:20.317
And don't lie because she left
her stink-ass scent in my robe.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.402
You let her put my robe on, too?

23:22.986 --> 23:26.865
- I didn't even know she wore underwear.
- Oh, you think this mess is funny.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.700
You gonna get this sauce
on your couch, woman.

23:28.784 --> 23:30.994
You know what,
and it's gonna go right along

23:31.078 --> 23:32.913
with all the other spots
that you done left in there.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.331
You are a pig!

23:34.414 --> 23:37.584
You're starting to remind me of Rodney
with all these "thots".

23:37.668 --> 23:40.170
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.

23:40.254 --> 23:42.214
Yeah, there is something wrong with you

23:42.297 --> 23:44.383
'cause you ain't never acted
like this before.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.552
Anyway...

23:46.885 --> 23:50.430
Oh, you just gonna ignore--
You just gonna ignore me?

23:50.889 --> 23:54.142
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

23:54.226 --> 23:57.479
We... are going to spend
some time together

23:57.563 --> 24:00.190
because, since you decided
to stay here tonight

24:00.274 --> 24:03.527
and I never get a chance
to spend time with you,

24:03.610 --> 24:07.906
I am going to go in the kitchen,
I'm going to grab some shot glasses

24:07.990 --> 24:09.950
and that bottle of tequila
that I've been saving,

24:10.033 --> 24:13.453
and you are gonna get some stuff
off of your chest.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.039
- How about that?
- Okay, all right. Yeah.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.875
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

24:17.958 --> 24:21.420
And if you turn on that TV,
I will turn off the cable,

24:21.503 --> 24:25.299
so just go on and sit your behind right
back down 'cause you know that I will.

24:25.382 --> 24:28.218
Well, hurry up, then.
Third quarter's about to start.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.012
All right.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.138
Sit your butt down.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.433
Mm.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.981
A'ight. This is about
to be your fourth shot.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.274
Yep!

24:42.357 --> 24:44.943
Ugh, I have nowhere to go...

24:45.861 --> 24:47.613
and neither do you.

24:48.989 --> 24:49.990
So...

24:51.533 --> 24:53.285
Hmm, bottoms up.

24:53.368 --> 24:54.870
- A'ight.
- Okay.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.462
- Mm!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.546
Now, whoo!

25:04.630 --> 25:07.216
Hey, hey, slow down,
that fourth one's gonna do you in.

25:07.299 --> 25:09.051
You ain't drink this much
in a long time.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.511
Uh, yep, nope!

25:10.594 --> 25:11.887
Nope, yep, see?

25:11.970 --> 25:16.350
But I am feelin'...
really good right about now.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.602
- And you lookin' really good.
- Thank ya... You know...

25:18.685 --> 25:23.232
it feels so good to be in my home,
like, not flying.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.192
- Whoosh! You know?
- Finally.

25:25.275 --> 25:28.362
Well, you got this big-ass house
and you've been gone, so...

25:28.820 --> 25:30.864
I'm gonna enjoy it for you.

25:30.948 --> 25:32.658
Well, that's why I'm selling it.

25:33.784 --> 25:36.537
- Now, see, that's just mean.
- No, I'm just, I'm just... Well, I'm...

25:36.620 --> 25:40.165
But really, no, serious... I'm play--
I'm playin', but I'm serious.

25:40.249 --> 25:43.377
But no, I'm gonna sell the house
and I'm gonna...

25:43.710 --> 25:44.753
go back to school.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.171
When you decide this?

25:46.922 --> 25:49.049
I just been...

25:49.132 --> 25:50.509
It's been a long time coming.

25:51.510 --> 25:55.514
It's just, um...
I need a career change, you know, and...

25:56.932 --> 25:59.017
I mean, look at me.

25:59.101 --> 26:00.352
I have no life.

26:00.435 --> 26:03.480
You know, I don't have a husband,
I don't have kids.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.191
I mean, don't you think
I should start thinking about that?

26:07.067 --> 26:09.987
Not really. There's no rush for that.
Look what I've been through.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.823
I've been loyal to that woman
for 20 years, married.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.409
- Now I'm going through a divorce.
- Hmm.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.035
So there's no rush.

26:17.119 --> 26:20.914
Husband and kids...
doesn't make a happy home.

26:21.331 --> 26:24.251
It's the individual, right?

26:24.626 --> 26:25.836
Yeah.

26:27.004 --> 26:31.258
But... at least you, like...
took a shot, you know what I mean?

26:31.341 --> 26:34.052
At least you have a life
and you try, you took a shot.

26:34.136 --> 26:37.848
Shot, huh? Some shot.

26:37.931 --> 26:41.143
Now look at me: like I said,
going through a divorce.

26:41.226 --> 26:44.730
So pretty much...
I'm back to square one...

26:45.397 --> 26:47.691
which puts us in the same boat.

26:48.108 --> 26:51.153
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you are.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.572
Mm! Speaking of which...

26:54.198 --> 26:56.241
your girl came by my office.

26:56.325 --> 26:57.367
Man.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.204
Oh, yeah? What she want?

27:01.246 --> 27:03.457
Well, it's not what she wanted,
it's actually what she said

27:03.540 --> 27:06.043
that's been, uh, on my mind all day.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.628
Hmm. What's that?

27:09.922 --> 27:14.426
She said that she feels that you are
in love with me.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.470
And she feels you always have been.

27:17.304 --> 27:19.556
Why would she say something like that?

27:20.265 --> 27:21.600
I don't know, but...

27:22.017 --> 27:24.686
you know, she always hated the fact
I called you my best friend.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.273
And so she figured
once she and I got married

27:28.357 --> 27:30.192
that she would be my best friend.

27:31.193 --> 27:32.152
Nah.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.321
She's not.

27:37.324 --> 27:39.952
It's always been you.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.997
And, you know, the truth is...

27:44.706 --> 27:47.125
your wife should be your best friend.

27:47.543 --> 27:50.170
- That's true.
- She just wasn't the right wife.

27:52.005 --> 27:53.215
Now, that's true.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.843
Absolutely.
You're right about that.

27:57.469 --> 27:58.637
I have a confession.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.851
Hey, it's...

28:05.143 --> 28:07.145
- Mm.
- Slow down, slow--

28:20.367 --> 28:21.994
Dana was right.

28:24.121 --> 28:25.789
I am in love with you.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.559
You... You okay?

28:45.642 --> 28:47.394
Shhh...

28:54.651 --> 28:55.569
Wow.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.093
Please!

29:20.177 --> 29:21.428
Hey, you decent?

29:25.682 --> 29:26.683
Come in.

29:29.561 --> 29:32.856
Hey. Just checking on you.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.484
- Yeah...
- How you feelin'?

29:36.235 --> 29:40.572
You were right...
I shouldn't have took all those shots.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.617
It wasn't the shots, it was
that bottle you took to the head.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.743
I told you.

29:45.661 --> 29:48.705
Yeah. Whatever it was,
it doesn't feel good.

29:49.498 --> 29:50.791
I didn't eat that much.

29:50.874 --> 29:53.669
Well, we got that pizza downstairs.
You want me to warm it up?

29:54.336 --> 29:56.922
No. I'll... I'll...

29:57.548 --> 30:00.676
- No, I just...
- Go slow, go slow.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.678
I just, uh...

30:02.761 --> 30:06.557
I just need to sit here for a moment
and I'll get it together.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.184
- All right.
- I'm okay, I'm sure.

30:09.852 --> 30:13.313
So, do you remember what you said
in the kitchen?

30:15.524 --> 30:17.192
I remember exactly what I said.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.612
So you remember that you said
that you were in love with me?

30:21.363 --> 30:22.948
But then you just...

30:23.031 --> 30:24.366
walked on away, you remember that?

30:25.659 --> 30:28.036
I know. It's just...

30:30.038 --> 30:32.374
I knew that I laid some heavy shit on you.

30:32.457 --> 30:36.211
And... you needed some time
and I did, too.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.966
Okay, so...

30:42.050 --> 30:47.306
you remember saying that
you were always in love with me?

30:48.974 --> 30:52.019
- Huh?
- Well, not always.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.439
- Well, that's mean.
- No, I'm just...

30:57.065 --> 30:59.276
It was around that time
in the eighth grade

30:59.359 --> 31:03.280
when you came to my rescue and...
beat up Derrick for me

31:03.363 --> 31:04.448
'cause he pushed me.

31:06.074 --> 31:09.411
- I did it with pizzazz, huh?
- Oh... Yeah.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.579
Man don't mess with you.

31:10.996 --> 31:14.208
I mean, you whooped him so bad,
you made me feel sorry for him.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.586
- Oh, you felt sorry for him?
- I felt sorry for him.

31:17.669 --> 31:20.672
Anyway... So is that when you started
to fall in love with me?

31:22.299 --> 31:24.134
It was when I started looking
at you differently

31:24.218 --> 31:26.512
and then by the time I got
to freshman year...

31:28.013 --> 31:29.890
I was fully in love with you.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.560
Now, why didn't you say anything?

31:34.228 --> 31:37.064
Because by the time I finally got
the nerve to say something,

31:37.147 --> 31:40.442
you introduced Dana as your girlfriend
and the rest is history.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.488
There were so many times
you guys broke up.

31:45.739 --> 31:48.784
I wanted to say something then
but you kept running back to her,

31:48.867 --> 31:54.039
and I just... had to protect my heart
and I, I just... suppressed it.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.042
Now it makes sense.
Now I understand.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.506
Well, uh... for my confession...

32:02.589 --> 32:04.842
- You said eighth grade, right?
- Yes.

32:06.134 --> 32:10.013
I've been in love with you
since the second grade.

32:12.224 --> 32:13.392
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.894
Yeah, from the first time I saw you...

32:16.228 --> 32:18.689
I said, "She's the prettiest girl
in the school."

32:22.568 --> 32:24.111
You said I was the prettiest girl?

32:25.362 --> 32:28.907
I still do.
And what makes you so well rounded,

32:28.991 --> 32:32.494
even now, is that you're not
stuck up or arrogant...

32:33.120 --> 32:36.623
- Like Dana.
- Yeah. Yeah. Like Dana.

32:37.624 --> 32:38.959
Yeah.

32:39.042 --> 32:42.379
So... So you never wanted
to try anything with me?

32:43.005 --> 32:45.799
Yeah, I wanted to have sex
with you, absolutely.

32:45.883 --> 32:47.301
- I did...
- Jesus.

32:47.384 --> 32:50.095
But I respected our... our friendship.

32:50.179 --> 32:51.930
And it would have messed that up.

32:53.182 --> 32:55.100
You were truly the best friend I ever had.

32:55.184 --> 32:57.686
So... nah...

33:01.023 --> 33:02.107
Nah.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.067
You know I feel the same way.

33:05.694 --> 33:07.279
I love you.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.325
I love you too.

33:12.618 --> 33:15.245
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:16.205 --> 33:20.292
Okay, so, I mean,
where do we go from here, huh?

33:22.628 --> 33:24.296
I would love to answer that...

33:24.379 --> 33:26.298
Okay.

33:26.381 --> 33:27.549
...but I got tequila coming up.

33:28.217 --> 33:32.387
You need me to come hold your hair?
All right, I'm here for you. Here I come.

33:52.783 --> 33:56.036
Ugh! Okay... You can do it.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.996
Couple more steps, you'll make it.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.458
You can do it, you can do it,
you can do it, you can do it...

34:01.542 --> 34:04.211
Jeez! It's so bright.

34:04.294 --> 34:06.839
Aha, welcome to the world.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.176
Yeah...

34:11.844 --> 34:14.012
Oh!

34:14.096 --> 34:15.472
How you feeling there, sunshine?

34:15.556 --> 34:19.643
Oh, don't even use the word "light."

34:19.726 --> 34:21.770
It just makes me wanna puke.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.856
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

34:23.938 --> 34:27.109
You pretty much threw your whole life up
last night, trust me.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.860
Oh! It doesn't feel like it.

34:28.944 --> 34:31.697
Feels like I still have some left in me.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.366
Yeah, don't worry about that now.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.077
So, you get that in you
for some balance...

34:37.159 --> 34:39.996
Take this, that'll make you feel better.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.965
- What is that?
- Oh, that's ginger root.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.675
Fresh ginger root tea.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.886
It's great for hangovers.

34:53.969 --> 34:56.429
Got you a Danish here, absorbs alcohol.

34:56.513 --> 35:00.976
Danish? Who eats Danish after having
a hangover and puking?

35:01.351 --> 35:04.646
So, you ain't had no toast, no, uh,
no pancakes, no biscuits.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.482
- You get what you get.
- Well... thank you.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.235
Got a little fruit here, and, uh...

35:17.075 --> 35:17.951
There you go.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.914
Yeah, I took off work.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.333
So I can take care of you.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.336
- You didn't have to do that.
- I know.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.087
But the way you were
throwin' 'em back last night...

35:29.171 --> 35:30.088
Ugh...

35:30.172 --> 35:32.341
I knew you were gonna need
somebody to take care of you, so...

35:32.424 --> 35:36.595
Told Rodney and Karen to take care
of everything, and I'm here.

35:37.304 --> 35:39.932
- I appreciate you.
- I know.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.393
You know, it has me... has me thinking.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.354
What about?

35:46.188 --> 35:48.315
I've been thinking about us.

35:49.858 --> 35:52.277
- Yeah.
- Okay, what about?

35:54.196 --> 35:56.615
It had me thinking,
where would we be right now

35:56.698 --> 35:59.618
if we knew what we knew now
about each other then,

35:59.701 --> 36:00.619
you know what I mean?

36:01.119 --> 36:04.373
Hmm.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.083
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.418
And since I know now
that the feeling is mutual...

36:11.505 --> 36:13.257
I wanna see where we can go from here.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.886
I mean, that's if... if you want to also.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.430
Well, I mean, Pierre...

36:22.057 --> 36:24.434
Your behavior lately has me wondering,

36:24.518 --> 36:27.688
like, are you really ready
to have anything with me?

36:28.188 --> 36:31.441
I mean, all these "thots" you've been
running in and out of my bedroom.

36:33.735 --> 36:36.697
You have to know they don't
mean anything to me. Right?

36:37.072 --> 36:40.909
I know that, but...
in a way, that's kind of irrelevant.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.703
I've just never seen you...

36:43.745 --> 36:45.914
sleep with so many women at one time.

36:45.998 --> 36:48.041
What has gotten into you?
I mean, why now?

36:48.709 --> 36:51.211
I don't know, I guess I'm afraid
to be hurt again.

36:51.295 --> 36:54.506
You know, after 20 years
of being loyal to Dana,

36:54.590 --> 36:55.716
and she does what she does,

36:55.799 --> 36:58.719
I don't want anybody
to be close to me again, you know?

36:58.802 --> 37:01.513
So, I see Rodney doing it,
dating various different women.

37:01.597 --> 37:06.518
He having a good time, so... I try it.
You know that's not me, though.

37:06.977 --> 37:08.770
'Cause I was married that long.

37:09.396 --> 37:13.192
And if I'm gonna let anybody
ever get close to me again,

37:13.275 --> 37:15.360
for me to be vulnerable again...

37:16.278 --> 37:18.363
I'm gonna take a chance with you.

37:19.072 --> 37:21.491
That's if you wanna take a chance with me.

37:22.951 --> 37:23.994
You really mean that?

37:24.661 --> 37:25.996
Every word.

37:28.832 --> 37:32.794
Well, uh... you know you're gonna
have to date me first.

37:32.878 --> 37:34.129
Oh, I gotta date you first.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.215
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

37:36.298 --> 37:38.425
You gonna have to date me, I'm serious.

37:38.509 --> 37:41.553
Okay, all right, well,
we can start dating tonight.

37:41.637 --> 37:42.888
Where do you want to go?

37:43.722 --> 37:45.057
I just wanna go back to bed.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.601
- We can have the first date in your bed.
- Hey-hey-hey-hey!

37:48.060 --> 37:51.188
Can we start tomorrow?
Can we go on a date then?

37:51.647 --> 37:53.565
Date tomorrow night.
You decide.

37:53.649 --> 37:57.069
Yes. And...
just so you know...

37:57.819 --> 38:00.447
we're not having sex until
you get that divorce with Dana,

38:00.531 --> 38:01.949
so don't even try it, kid.

38:02.032 --> 38:05.160
- What part of the game is that?
- Uh... you heard me.

38:05.994 --> 38:07.621
And just so you know, too,

38:07.704 --> 38:11.583
ain't no sex with big, bad,
and bougie bitches, either.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.877
- I can't have no bad and bougie bitch?
- No.

38:13.961 --> 38:16.588
What if they're good and ghetto?
Or light-skinned and luscious?

38:16.672 --> 38:19.633
Ain't no more of bringing them bitches
over here at my house.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.761
I mean, look, after I'd hurt my back
lifting you up all those stairs,

38:22.845 --> 38:24.763
I would think you'd give me something.

38:24.847 --> 38:28.183
- Whatever. Anyway.
- Well, give me a place to sleep in.

38:28.684 --> 38:31.353
Thank you for, uh,
taking care of me this morning.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.273
Trying to take care of you, girl.

38:34.356 --> 38:35.399
Good night.

38:36.441 --> 38:38.110
"Good and ghetto," I like that.

38:38.819 --> 38:40.904
I like that.

38:43.866 --> 38:45.450
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

38:45.534 --> 38:47.828
No more tequila for me,
I'm drinking this water.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.539
- How are you guys doing here?
- Oh, just fine.

38:50.622 --> 38:53.375
- I think I'm done with this.
- Thank you.

38:53.458 --> 38:54.835
-Did you wanna get dessert, anything?

38:54.918 --> 38:58.130
- We've got crème brûlée.
- No, no, I'm fine, thank you so much.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.423
Everything was wonderful.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.928
Can you believe she was gonna fight me
over that parking space?

39:05.012 --> 39:07.848
Well, you did just pull right in.
You know you was wrong for that.

39:07.931 --> 39:09.808
You knew she was waiting
for that parking space.

39:09.892 --> 39:13.145
No, excuse me, first of all,
we both pulled in at the same time.

39:13.228 --> 39:16.023
Now, I could have let her go,
but I was having a good time with you.

39:16.648 --> 39:19.610
Um, I wasn't gonna say anything, but...

39:19.693 --> 39:22.279
she been giving us the stink eye
the whole entire night.

39:22.362 --> 39:25.365
I feel like she gonna, like, try to cut us
or something when we go back to the car.

39:25.449 --> 39:29.161
No, she better not.
Damn sure she better not.

39:29.244 --> 39:31.830
Doesn't matter. I'm just enjoying
my time here with you.

39:31.914 --> 39:33.415
- So am I.
- Right?

39:33.498 --> 39:35.626
Yeah. You know, this is like...

39:36.210 --> 39:38.420
this is like our first, like...

39:38.504 --> 39:40.756
Why you giggling with
the little dimples, huh?

39:40.839 --> 39:43.592
Because it's... our first official date.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.844
- First official one.
- What?

39:45.928 --> 39:48.222
But, you know, there's more surprises
I have for you.

39:49.264 --> 39:50.182
- Yeah?
- If you up to it.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.517
Well, what is it?

39:51.850 --> 39:54.394
Now, how is it a surprise if I tell you?
Huh?

39:54.478 --> 39:56.188
So I guess I have to wait, don't I?

39:56.271 --> 39:58.232
- I guess you're gonna have to.
- Whoa.

39:58.315 --> 39:59.942
That's for damn sure.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.027
Well, what I am going to do...

40:02.110 --> 40:03.320
So, what you gonna do?

40:03.403 --> 40:06.657
I am actually gonna go powder my nose...

40:06.740 --> 40:08.450
Want me to come in there with you?

40:08.534 --> 40:12.079
- You know you want me to go with you.
- You are so silly.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.998
- Huh?
- But when I return...

40:16.041 --> 40:17.960
you're gonna take me on that adventure.

40:18.043 --> 40:19.002
- I am.
- Yeah.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.587
- I got that surprise.
- Mmm.

40:28.178 --> 40:29.721
'Cause I got that big surprise for you.

40:29.805 --> 40:30.764
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

40:30.848 --> 40:31.807
You're bad.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.519
Mm-hmm. ...with your sexy self.

40:35.602 --> 40:38.564
- Don't be checking out my ass, either.
- I can't help it 'cause I want it.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.482
With your sexy Tweety Bird-lookin' self.

40:46.738 --> 40:49.783
See anything interesting on the menu
you wanna try tonight, babe?

40:50.826 --> 40:53.370
I see something very interesting
but it's not on the menu.

40:57.082 --> 41:00.669
Yeah. It all looks so good,
but I don't know what to choose.

41:00.752 --> 41:04.256
Yeah. Well, order the grilled salmon

41:04.339 --> 41:06.133
and asparagus for me.

41:06.717 --> 41:09.136
- Okay.
- Excuse me, I'm going to the ladies' room.

41:09.219 --> 41:12.639
- All right, don't you get lost.
- Oh, please.

41:26.028 --> 41:27.821
Well, well, well.

41:27.905 --> 41:30.574
This bitch.

41:30.657 --> 41:35.412
So, Dana, you have nothing better to do
than to stalk me at this restaurant?

41:35.495 --> 41:38.290
Actually, I do have better things to do
and I was doing it.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.710
So let me take a wild guess,
you're here with my husband, aren't you?

41:41.793 --> 41:45.839
Uh, yeah, you know that I'm here
with your soon-to-be ex-husband.

41:46.173 --> 41:48.425
- So what?
- So you finally got him, huh?

41:48.509 --> 41:49.801
Hmm.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.595
You've always wanted him,
and you know it.

41:51.929 --> 41:54.431
Always hanging around him,
all up in his ass.

41:55.849 --> 41:57.684
Oh, Phenix, my sloppy seconds?

41:57.768 --> 42:00.437
Oh, girl.
You can't find your own man?

42:00.521 --> 42:02.147
My own man?

42:02.231 --> 42:05.901
Well, see, Dana, the way that you have men
running in and out of you,

42:05.984 --> 42:08.445
you think that every man is your man...

42:09.488 --> 42:13.116
and don't be mad at me because
you weren't woman enough to keep him.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.994
Correction. He wasn't man enough
to keep me.

42:16.078 --> 42:17.329
I lost interest first.

42:17.412 --> 42:22.376
Oh! So you think that
cheating on your husband...

42:22.751 --> 42:26.880
who worked his ass off to give you
the life that you wanted, was the answer.

42:26.964 --> 42:31.009
You know, I will never understand
what he saw in you.

42:32.094 --> 42:34.721
And by the way, I have to say...

42:35.347 --> 42:38.058
he is all man enough to keep me.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.436
So I guess you been
screwing my husband for...

42:41.520 --> 42:43.647
...for God knows how long.

42:47.192 --> 42:50.696
You know, you are funny,
and you're a selfish bitch.

42:51.238 --> 42:52.990
You had him under your thumb

42:53.073 --> 42:55.909
and he was willing to do anything
and everything for you,

42:56.243 --> 42:58.328
but you messed it up,
so don't be mad at me

42:58.412 --> 43:00.539
because he's finally able to move on.

43:01.248 --> 43:04.751
Hell, you practically stood here
and said that you don't want him,

43:04.835 --> 43:07.379
so the question that I have for you is...

43:07.921 --> 43:09.548
why do you even care?

43:12.342 --> 43:15.137
Exactly. I don't have time for this.

43:16.722 --> 43:20.642
But what I do have time for
is your husband.

43:21.810 --> 43:22.686
Enjoy.

43:22.769 --> 43:24.104
Oh, bitch.

43:29.067 --> 43:29.985
You need change, sir?

43:30.068 --> 43:32.362
Mm. No, you've been great.
Thank you so much.

43:32.821 --> 43:35.657
- Hey, babe, you ready?
- Baby, Dana's here.

43:36.658 --> 43:39.036
- What?
- So you have been sleeping with her.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.830
You're in no position
to ask me anything, woman.

43:41.914 --> 43:43.874
How long have you been
screwing her, Pierre?

43:43.957 --> 43:47.294
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm not talking to you, Phenix.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.088
- You're making a scene.
- I don't care.

43:50.547 --> 43:52.466
I'm not sure what my attorneys
would do with the information

43:52.549 --> 43:54.593
that you've been cheating on me
with Phenix for years,

43:54.676 --> 43:56.261
but we'll just have to wait
and see, won't we?

43:57.262 --> 43:58.555
We won't. Let's go.

43:59.973 --> 44:01.767
I'm not stupid, Pierre.

44:01.850 --> 44:04.811
Hey! You okay? I've been looking
all over the restaurant for you.

44:04.895 --> 44:06.104
I'm fine.

44:06.855 --> 44:08.524
So you're gonna bring this mark,

44:08.941 --> 44:11.276
a dude that you were sucking off
in my bedroom,

44:11.360 --> 44:13.695
you're gonna question me?
Huh?

44:14.029 --> 44:15.072
PJ.

44:16.365 --> 44:19.117
My man, it's not about you, all right?

44:19.201 --> 44:23.455
So if you value your life,
I suggest you go in the other room.

44:23.539 --> 44:24.498
A'ight?

44:26.583 --> 44:29.586
Baby, I gotta take a call anyway.
I'll be at the table.

44:30.337 --> 44:31.338
His soft ass.

44:31.421 --> 44:33.298
A mark ass, let's go.

44:33.632 --> 44:34.883
Enjoy your night.

44:39.972 --> 44:41.431
What y'all looking at?

45:07.249 --> 45:08.625
What's on your mind?

45:08.709 --> 45:11.128
You haven't said one word to me
since we left the restaurant.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.260
I do remember saying
this was a one-time thing.

45:19.011 --> 45:22.598
I'm taking a test
for the state broker's license.

45:23.515 --> 45:24.975
What are you doing here?

45:25.058 --> 45:26.518
Look, I need to talk to you.

45:27.477 --> 45:29.813
I'm not gonna sit here and have
a conversation with myself.

45:29.897 --> 45:33.108
- I'm going to bed.
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

45:34.109 --> 45:36.069
I'm sorry I let her ruin our night.

45:37.112 --> 45:38.197
I don't want you to go.

45:39.323 --> 45:40.240
P...

45:41.283 --> 45:43.327
Look, if we're gonna have
any kind of a chance,

45:43.410 --> 45:45.078
you gotta stop letting her get to you.

45:45.162 --> 45:47.372
You've been doing the same thing
since high school.

45:47.456 --> 45:50.083
You have to stop letting her win.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.627
I'm not letting her win.

45:53.378 --> 45:54.588
You know, it's just that...

45:55.088 --> 45:58.133
everything she's been taking me through,
the courts and all that,

45:58.675 --> 46:00.928
she's just always trying to get to me.

46:02.638 --> 46:05.933
Trying?
It looks like she's winning.

46:06.642 --> 46:07.643
I guess you're right.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.561
Hey...

46:11.021 --> 46:13.774
You know if she messes with you,
she messes with me.

46:14.233 --> 46:16.610
I'm 'bout to go to bat for you,
you know what I'm sayin'?

46:16.693 --> 46:18.570
Like she messes with you,
she messes with me.

46:18.654 --> 46:21.323
She got me over here losing my voice.
I'm hoarse over this, man.

46:21.406 --> 46:24.326
- But you know what I'm sayin'?
- I know you're crazy, so...

46:24.409 --> 46:26.286
Yeah. I am crazy.

46:26.370 --> 46:28.747
- Yeah.
- Crazy about you.

46:30.791 --> 46:31.792
Really?

46:33.919 --> 46:35.546
I'm crazy about you, too.

46:35.879 --> 46:37.047
You sure?

46:38.423 --> 46:39.633
I'll show you, come here.

46:40.884 --> 46:41.927
Come here.

46:46.473 --> 46:48.350
I'm sorry, all right?

46:49.476 --> 46:50.561
Hey, I love you.

46:51.395 --> 46:52.479
I love you.

46:52.563 --> 46:54.690
- I love you, too.
- Yeah?

47:23.010 --> 47:26.763
Man, I ate too much, man,
but this Crazy Hog is good as hell, bruh.

47:26.847 --> 47:30.017
You know, I should have got a to-go thing
for Phenix, but she loves to cook, so...

47:30.100 --> 47:31.935
Still can't believe
you're hittin' that.

47:32.019 --> 47:33.729
Will you respect
my relationship, man?

47:33.812 --> 47:36.398
- Ahh! I thought I heard you two.
- Yeah.

47:36.481 --> 47:38.942
That back office is really
coming together, by the way.

47:39.026 --> 47:40.944
- Nice.
- Yes, it is.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.988
So, Karen, I have any messages?

47:43.071 --> 47:45.449
No, unfortunately you don't, but, uh...

47:45.532 --> 47:48.493
- Mr. Rodney Chase...
- Oh!

47:48.577 --> 47:49.578
...has two.

47:49.661 --> 47:51.788
Hey-hey! I love the chase.

47:51.872 --> 47:52.956
We just came from eatin'.

47:53.373 --> 47:56.210
There's some wings.
I like mine bone-in.

47:56.293 --> 47:57.419
How do you like your bone?

47:57.503 --> 47:59.880
Oh. In.

47:59.963 --> 48:01.924
- She like it in.
- Okay, all right.

48:02.007 --> 48:03.300
She like it in.

48:03.383 --> 48:07.262
You look like a yellow... black Lemonhead.

48:07.346 --> 48:09.681
Remember those candies?
Liked to eat 'em in the back of class,

48:09.765 --> 48:12.351
throw 'em in the air, whoosh...
right in my mouth.

48:12.768 --> 48:14.019
I could probably pop you in my mouth.

48:14.102 --> 48:17.105
Why don't you toss yourself in your office
and get on those calls?

48:17.189 --> 48:19.358
You can't take a joke.

48:19.441 --> 48:21.568
- I'm just joking.
- Go to the office.

48:22.736 --> 48:23.779
My man.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.281
- Young lady.
- Yes.

48:26.365 --> 48:27.741
- No fraternizing, okay?
- Okay.

48:27.824 --> 48:30.077
All right, so, finish
what you're doing here,

48:30.160 --> 48:32.246
let's go in the back,
there's the conference room.

48:32.329 --> 48:34.373
- Okay.
- Let's knock that out, all right?

48:34.456 --> 48:37.042
Oh, Mr. Jackson, you did get a package.

48:39.711 --> 48:43.423
A'ight... Okay, so...
finish up, see you in the back. Okay?

48:43.507 --> 48:44.591
Gotcha. Done.

48:45.259 --> 48:47.636
Bone in, huh?
Yeah, that's professional.

48:50.097 --> 48:51.098
No.

49:34.725 --> 49:37.019
Hey, Rod. Rod.

49:37.102 --> 49:38.687
- Huh?
- Come here.

49:44.484 --> 49:45.360
What's up?

49:45.861 --> 49:46.820
Hey, what's up?

49:47.279 --> 49:48.530
I got this package, man.

49:48.614 --> 49:51.366
There's no postage,
no return address...

49:51.450 --> 49:54.203
but it's made out to me.
I don't think I should open it.

49:54.536 --> 49:56.371
Shit, man, I'll open it.

49:56.455 --> 49:59.458
Hey, hey, hey, man, you're the one
who told me, don't trust Dana, right?

49:59.958 --> 50:02.544
Man, she ain't that crazy, man.

50:03.045 --> 50:04.671
Now, what you jumping up, hiding for?

50:04.755 --> 50:07.674
Watch your scary ass.
There ain't no bomb in here.

50:07.758 --> 50:10.719
Sit y'all tall, light-skin ass down, man.

50:10.802 --> 50:13.305
I'm just saying be careful.
We don't know what that is.

50:13.388 --> 50:15.891
Man, you are trippin'.
You know, that's what's wrong with you.

50:16.266 --> 50:19.436
Light skin, that's the light-skin genes
you got in you, man.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.522
Y'all built different, bruh.

50:21.605 --> 50:23.565
Soft around the edges.

50:23.649 --> 50:26.318
See what you got...

50:26.652 --> 50:28.904
See that? No bomb.

50:28.987 --> 50:30.447
Okay, so what's in there?

50:32.032 --> 50:33.700
- Ooh, whee.
- Uh-huh.

50:34.743 --> 50:36.537
These two are gorgeous.

50:37.037 --> 50:37.996
Let me see that.

50:38.997 --> 50:41.083
These two! Look at that.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.379
That's them two chicks you bagged
after the club that one night.

50:50.008 --> 50:51.510
Yeah, I remember them.

50:51.927 --> 50:53.846
Yeah, little hot pocket.

50:56.473 --> 50:58.976
Hey. Hey, uh...

51:00.936 --> 51:01.895
What's that?

51:02.479 --> 51:05.065
You need to read this.
Check this out, bro.

51:05.482 --> 51:07.985
Wow.

51:09.361 --> 51:13.115
"Pierre, the photos are
to refresh your memory of us

51:13.198 --> 51:14.992
from several weeks back.

51:15.075 --> 51:18.161
I assume delivering this news in person
may not go over too well,

51:18.954 --> 51:20.372
so I'll just get to the point.

51:21.456 --> 51:23.959
Your one night of pleasure
with me and Tiffany has made you...

51:27.337 --> 51:28.797
a father of two."

51:29.923 --> 51:31.675
They're saying
they're six weeks' pregnant.

51:32.634 --> 51:35.429
"And enclosed are two separate
pregnancy tests as proof."

51:37.055 --> 51:39.725
Hey, man, they peed on that.
Just put that back, man.

51:39.808 --> 51:44.104
Man, they fine. I drink their bath water.
A little pee never hurt nobody.

51:44.188 --> 51:46.064
- What's wrong with you, man?
- I don't know.

51:46.148 --> 51:48.192
- Something's wrong with you.
- It is.

51:49.568 --> 51:52.529
"We're both willing to take another test
to prove to you again,

51:52.613 --> 51:54.990
but bottom line is we need to talk.

51:55.782 --> 51:58.285
Whenever you're ready,
you can reach my cell...

51:58.702 --> 52:00.871
at 312..."
Blah-blah-blah.

52:01.246 --> 52:03.415
"We'll be waiting for your call.

52:03.874 --> 52:05.209
Raquel."

52:05.542 --> 52:08.378
- Wow, bruh.
- No, man, this can't be possible, man.

52:08.462 --> 52:12.966
See, actually, it <i>can </i> be possible,
because I remember you told me

52:13.050 --> 52:15.260
you didn't remember anything that night.

52:16.136 --> 52:17.387
Yeah. You're right.

52:17.471 --> 52:21.391
Right, and see, that's what makes me mad
'cause I really can't remember, man.

52:22.976 --> 52:25.354
I mean, getting two women pregnant
at the same time?

52:26.230 --> 52:28.732
I mean, how can I tell Phenix that? Huh?

52:28.815 --> 52:31.401
It's over, right?
I mean, if this is true, it's over.

52:31.485 --> 52:34.196
Well, you know what?
Let's not jump to conclusions.

52:34.279 --> 52:37.449
- We don't even know if this is true.
- But what if it is? That's the point.

52:38.116 --> 52:41.411
- Huh?
- Listen, what you need to do is

52:41.495 --> 52:43.956
you need to make 'em go to the hospital,
get 'em checked out,

52:44.039 --> 52:46.291
- and you need to go with them.
- I'm not going nowhere with them.

52:46.375 --> 52:49.503
They come here to my office.
We'll take the test right here.

52:50.754 --> 52:52.130
I'm not going anywhere with them.

52:52.214 --> 52:53.173
Hey...

52:57.261 --> 52:58.679
I'm just gonna call 'em.

52:59.471 --> 53:01.932
- Man.
- Yeah.

53:02.015 --> 53:03.308
See what she got to say.

53:03.392 --> 53:04.476
Give 'em a call, man.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.353
And you need to let them have it, too.

53:06.687 --> 53:09.439
Like call them all out, you gotta
scare 'em, you know what I mean?

53:09.523 --> 53:11.275
Don't-- Hey, let 'em have it.

53:14.820 --> 53:17.739
Hey, Raquel. Yeah, it's Pierre.

53:17.823 --> 53:20.659
Got your package,
received your letter.

53:22.119 --> 53:24.371
Want you and your girl to meet me
in my office in about an hour.

53:25.080 --> 53:29.960
All right. You can do that? Okay.
So I'm gonna text you the address.

53:32.546 --> 53:34.464
What the hell was that, man?

53:34.548 --> 53:35.674
You ain't even say nothin'.

53:35.757 --> 53:38.719
'Cause I wanna get them both here,
look 'em in the eyes.

53:39.303 --> 53:40.929
'Cause I don't believe this is true, man.

53:41.305 --> 53:44.850
They wouldn't even come and tell you
straight to your face that they pregnant.

53:44.933 --> 53:46.518
Why you think they're gonna
come down here, man?

53:46.602 --> 53:48.979
'Cause they sent that package.
They want something.

53:49.062 --> 53:51.815
So I can guarantee you they will be here.

53:52.149 --> 53:55.152
You want me to hang around,
wait for them to come? Stay with you?

53:56.987 --> 53:58.322
Nah, man, just, uh...

53:59.615 --> 54:02.117
- Can you do something with that?
- What you want me to do with it?

54:02.201 --> 54:05.704
I don't know, just put it up somewhere.
Like I say, don't throw it away, though.

54:05.787 --> 54:08.874
I might need it for some evidence.
I ain't been through this before.

54:08.957 --> 54:11.293
- I gotta figure this out.
- I know what to do with it.

54:12.085 --> 54:15.255
Gimme... gimme the pictures.
Let me get those.

54:16.173 --> 54:17.674
I know what to do with them.

54:21.136 --> 54:22.262
My man.

54:23.055 --> 54:23.931
This is serious.

54:24.681 --> 54:26.934
Don't judge me.
Everybody has their vices.

54:27.017 --> 54:28.769
Do not judge me.

54:29.186 --> 54:32.314
He who has two women pregnant
at the same time.

54:32.397 --> 54:34.983
'Cause I like to smell
a little pee from time to time,

54:35.067 --> 54:38.278
you gonna go get
all heavenly on me, nigga...

54:54.628 --> 54:57.798
So, what'd you say about your girl?
She's not coming at all?

54:58.173 --> 55:01.468
Tiffany, she's not feeling well
and couldn't make it, but I'm here.

55:01.969 --> 55:05.764
Yeah, okay, well... if both of you are
claiming to be pregnant,

55:05.848 --> 55:07.266
then both of y'all should be here.

55:07.975 --> 55:10.894
Well, I couldn't make her come,
and like I said, she's sick.

55:11.353 --> 55:13.355
The baby's not allowing her
to hold any food down.

55:13.981 --> 55:15.816
- She ain't been to work in like three--
- Okay, okay.

55:15.899 --> 55:18.610
Well, I definitely want you all to take
a test, that's for damn sure.

55:18.986 --> 55:20.279
- And we're willing to.
- All right.

55:20.362 --> 55:22.322
But when it come back positive,
then what?

55:23.574 --> 55:25.784
You know, God knows
I'm not ready for this.

55:25.868 --> 55:27.911
I'm pretty sure you two
aren't either, but...

55:28.495 --> 55:31.373
I like you, we had a good time,
so, we wanna all try to make this work

55:31.456 --> 55:33.542
like <i>Three's Company</i>, we can or...

55:33.625 --> 55:35.919
wanna just do the co-parent thing,
we could do that, too.

55:36.336 --> 55:39.423
So if these seeds are mine, I'm letting
you know I'm gonna take care of them.

55:40.299 --> 55:42.009
- Unless...
- Unless what?

55:42.092 --> 55:43.594
Unless you're willing to work out a deal.

55:44.845 --> 55:45.804
What kind of deal?

55:47.014 --> 55:48.682
Tiffany and I are willing
to get rid of them.

55:49.850 --> 55:52.436
And you can forget
that any of this ever happened.

55:52.519 --> 55:55.606
- Hmm.
- But it's gonna cost you.

55:55.689 --> 55:57.107
- Oh, it's gonna cost me.
- Yeah.

55:58.483 --> 56:00.986
Okay. How much is it gonna cost me?

56:01.486 --> 56:03.322
- Ten thousand dollars.
- Jeez.

56:03.739 --> 56:05.574
- Each.
- Oh, okay.

56:05.657 --> 56:07.784
Part of the money we'll use
to get rid of the problem.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.828
And you won't hear from us again.

56:10.412 --> 56:12.289
Well, listen to this,
I'm gonna help you out.

56:12.372 --> 56:14.875
First of all, I don't believe
in abortion, okay?

56:14.958 --> 56:18.504
And secondly,
no abortion costs $10,000.

56:18.837 --> 56:20.172
- I said part of the money.
- Oh.

56:20.255 --> 56:22.424
- You just said you wasn't ready for this.
- I'm not.

56:22.508 --> 56:25.427
- Make up your mind.
- If you wanna have an abortion,

56:25.511 --> 56:28.096
take yourself down to the Free Clinic
or Cook County Hospital.

56:28.180 --> 56:30.140
Otherwise you can sign
the parental rights over to me,

56:30.224 --> 56:32.643
and those are my seeds,
I will take care of both of them.

56:32.726 --> 56:34.269
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, it's not gonna happen?

56:34.353 --> 56:35.687
- That's not gonna happen.
- Why it's not gonna happen?

56:35.771 --> 56:39.024
- 'Cause it's not.
- 'Cause it's bullshit, that's why. Yeah.

56:39.525 --> 56:43.320
You'd rather kill the child
than give it up for adoption?

56:43.403 --> 56:46.782
So if you wanna keep this charade
going on, make an appointment with Karen,

56:46.865 --> 56:49.284
okay, and bring the tests back
when y'all are ready.

56:49.368 --> 56:51.495
Look, I'm not gonna go back and forth
with you about this.

56:51.578 --> 56:53.413
- You ain't gotta do nothing.
- We'll be in touch.

56:53.497 --> 56:55.582
You ain't gotta touch me;
touch yourself, short-stack.

56:55.666 --> 56:57.709
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

56:59.878 --> 57:01.380
These bitches, man...

57:03.048 --> 57:04.967
Wait till I tell Rodney this shit.

57:05.050 --> 57:06.844
Ten thousand dollars.

57:09.763 --> 57:10.931
Ten g's.

57:14.268 --> 57:16.645
- Hey.
- Heyyy!

57:16.728 --> 57:19.189
- Smells good in here.
- Yeah!

57:19.523 --> 57:20.899
How you doin'?

57:21.233 --> 57:22.609
Why, what you makin'?

57:22.693 --> 57:26.280
Oh, well, I got some steaks
in the oven...

57:26.363 --> 57:28.198
- Okay.
- ....and I got a little salad.

57:28.282 --> 57:30.576
I got a little dessert for us.

57:31.201 --> 57:32.494
You got a lot of everything.

57:32.578 --> 57:33.662
I do?

57:34.329 --> 57:36.456
I wanna thank you
for making all this food.

57:36.540 --> 57:39.084
I'm getting a little bigger now,
I'm gaining weight.

57:39.168 --> 57:40.627
Looks good on you.

57:40.711 --> 57:44.965
But it is good, so I thank you...
for what you do, I appreciate you.

57:45.048 --> 57:48.552
Well, you deserve it
and I like doing it, so...

57:49.344 --> 57:51.430
Yes! I love it.

57:51.513 --> 57:52.890
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

57:54.558 --> 57:55.767
So, how was your day?

57:56.727 --> 57:59.479
Uh, it was interesting, to say the least.

57:59.563 --> 58:02.316
Possibly life-changing,
which is why I need to talk to you.

58:02.399 --> 58:04.943
Okay, all right.
Well, I am listening.

58:05.611 --> 58:07.613
Uh, I need your undivided attention.

58:08.197 --> 58:10.282
So can we go sit down, please?

58:11.450 --> 58:12.743
Okay.

58:15.162 --> 58:16.079
Everything okay?

58:17.998 --> 58:19.583
Well, let's talk about it.

58:21.335 --> 58:25.297
You know how we said we would
always be fully transparent...

58:26.340 --> 58:28.217
with each other
and tell each other everything?

58:28.592 --> 58:29.468
Yeah.

58:30.552 --> 58:31.803
Because we're best friends.

58:33.388 --> 58:35.390
You know I love you, right?

58:35.474 --> 58:38.477
Of course I do. I love you--
What is going on?

58:40.103 --> 58:41.855
You're kind of freaking me out
a little bit.

58:41.939 --> 58:44.107
I'm just gonna... just go right into it.

58:47.486 --> 58:49.947
I had a threesome with these two ladies

58:50.030 --> 58:53.367
and they're claiming
I got both of them pregnant.

58:54.618 --> 58:55.744
And, uh...

58:58.163 --> 58:59.998
I'm sorry.

59:04.086 --> 59:07.881
Pierre Jackson, are you kidding me?

59:08.799 --> 59:09.967
I mean...

59:10.384 --> 59:13.053
You didn't use protection?
Did you do this mess in my bed?

59:13.554 --> 59:15.222
- I don't...
- Wow!

59:15.889 --> 59:18.016
And I'm sorry, Phenix.
I really am.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.310
How irresponsible can you be?

59:20.936 --> 59:23.105
Look, I... I'm sorry.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.233
Phenix, I really am.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

59:28.151 --> 59:29.611
If it's true...

59:30.904 --> 59:32.739
I'm gonna take care
of my responsibilities.

59:33.490 --> 59:35.492
But more importantly, I need...

59:35.576 --> 59:38.203
...you to be by my side.

59:38.287 --> 59:40.205
I need you to help me through this.

59:40.956 --> 59:42.875
I can't do this by myself.

59:44.334 --> 59:49.882
And despite everything...
these babies didn't ask to be here.

59:51.550 --> 59:56.138
So... if they are mine...

59:58.599 --> 01:00:00.434
I'm gonna take care of them.

01:00:03.228 --> 01:00:04.897
You know I don't believe in abortion.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:09.860
I would never ask you
for an abortion-- abortions.

01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:12.070
I'm not that selfish.

01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:13.614
I know.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.992
And ironically, uh...

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:19.870
one of the girls came to my job.

01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:26.293
And, uh, she proposed that I give her
and the other girl $10,000 apiece

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:28.504
and they would have an abortion.

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.797
- What?
- Yeah.

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:33.884
Well, I told them,
I don't believe in abortion.

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.929
And if they want to sign over
their parental rights, then...

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:41.266
then I would take care of them,
the babies.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.772
So... you're talking about
taking care of two kids...

01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:49.191
by two different women.

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:51.860
You're not even ready to be a father.

01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:54.905
I know, I know,
and I'm not ready for any of this.

01:00:55.697 --> 01:01:00.327
I know, but if they're mine,
what choice do I have, right?

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:06.750
But I need you there with me by my side.
I can't do this alone.

01:01:06.834 --> 01:01:09.753
I'm terrified.
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:01:11.129 --> 01:01:13.465
Phenix, please...

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:18.220
don't leave me.

01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:19.596
Okay?

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.266
I know this is hard...

01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:25.227
but I need you.

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:30.482
I just wanna smack the shit out of you.

01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:37.155
You are so lucky
that we have been friends this long.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:42.035
'Cause I don't know any other woman
who would stand here

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:44.663
and stick by you
through all this bullshit.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.209
S-So you're gonna stay?

01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:56.175
Oh, but, see, this is why,
see, that's why...

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:57.593
that's why I love you.

01:01:57.676 --> 01:01:59.469
Not just because of this.

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:03.557
That's why I'm in love with you,
'cause you've had my back since day one.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.143
I'm sorry.

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:10.731
But I do have some good news.

01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:13.025
Yeah?

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:15.819
What's that?

01:02:18.488 --> 01:02:22.492
Dana and her attorney
finally agreed to the mediation.

01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:24.286
That's great.

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:27.331
And I want you there, okay?

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:31.335
I would love to be there, but, uh...

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:35.589
all of us in the same room,
you already know how crazy that is.

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:38.634
Nah, don't worry about that.
You with me now, okay?

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:39.968
She has to understand that.

01:02:42.346 --> 01:02:44.473
- Yeah.
- So, will you come?

01:02:47.059 --> 01:02:48.685
To be honest, I really... I can't.

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:52.189
I... I have those meetings
with the schools and everything,

01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:53.607
I have two interviews.

01:02:54.483 --> 01:02:55.817
I can't cancel them.

01:02:56.193 --> 01:02:59.446
I know, I know, school is...
it's important.

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:02.157
It's important to you, so, uh...
I understand.

01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:05.661
But I'll be here.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.038
When you get home.

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.099
Thank you.

01:03:48.787 --> 01:03:50.956
I do not want to agree
to their settlement.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.916
I got you.

01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:00.674
All right, I'm ready.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:03.802
Now we can get started.

01:04:08.015 --> 01:04:10.726
Dana, no matter what,
you're not budging, correct?

01:04:10.809 --> 01:04:12.269
Hmm-mm.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.940
Okay, so now that I have intake
on your relationship

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.984
and I've gone over
the financial agenda checklist,

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:22.654
quite obvious as to how this can
drag out in court even longer.

01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:26.116
That is, if we can't come to some sort
of agreement here today.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.244
My final suggestion is that I take
Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Brown

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:32.956
over to another room where Mr. Jackson
remains in this room with his attorney.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.042
I would then go
from one room to the other

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.002
to speak with each party individually.

01:04:37.377 --> 01:04:40.631
I will offer settlement suggestions,
including negotiations.

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:42.591
Are we all on board with that?

01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:44.968
- You on board with that?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:48.180
- I'm fine with that.
- Good.

01:04:48.514 --> 01:04:51.808
I will allow a half an hour break
for each of you to consult with counsel.

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:55.103
So, Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Brown,
if you could just follow me.

01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:57.481
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, hold up a sec.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:05:02.569
Can, um, I have one moment
with my wife, please?

01:05:03.654 --> 01:05:06.865
- Why, Pierre?
- Please, okay? Just for a moment.

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.243
Wait, are you okay with this?

01:05:10.702 --> 01:05:11.620
Yes, I'm fine.

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:13.539
- Thank you.
- Five minutes.

01:05:13.622 --> 01:05:15.082
Okay, five minutes.

01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:17.334
I can guarantee it will be less than that.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:22.673
- What's this about, Pierre?
- This is about you.

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:26.468
What are you doing? Huh?

01:05:27.177 --> 01:05:28.762
I've given you everything.

01:05:29.555 --> 01:05:32.683
You have both houses, both cars.

01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:34.476
You have my boat.

01:05:35.102 --> 01:05:38.480
The alimony that I gave you
that's conducive to your lifestyle.

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:42.067
But you wanna keep this up.
Right?

01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:43.819
Okay...

01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:47.906
I want you to read this.

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:54.079
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

01:06:01.128 --> 01:06:03.380
<i>"Pierre, I'm so sorry to bother you,</i>

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:05.757
<i>but I just had to let you know,
we're not pregnant.</i>

01:06:06.175 --> 01:06:09.219
<i>We met Dana through mutual friends
and she hired us to bribe you.</i>

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:12.639
<i>The club, the threesomes,
the fake pregnancies...</i>

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:14.683
<i>everything was all her.</i>

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:17.311
<i>She's been having you followed
ever since you left her</i>

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:19.021
<i>and she knows your every move."</i>

01:06:19.646 --> 01:06:22.691
Yeah. Familiar, isn't it?

01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:26.778
<i>"She was sure you would go for us to get
rid of the babies and give up the money.</i>

01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:30.115
<i>She also agreed that if you did,
we could keep half.</i>

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:33.160
<i>But when you didn't go for it, she got mad
and reneged on what she was</i>

01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.370
<i>supposed to pay us
if things fell through with you.</i>

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.958
<i>I wanted to hit you with this now
because I knew y'all had mediation today,</i>

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:42.294
<i>so, I'm blowin' that bitch cover.</i>

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:45.964
<i>So use this to your advantage
and let your attorney see this text.</i>

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:47.758
<i>You will win, trust me.</i>

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.385
<i>I can even speak with him if you'd like.</i>

01:06:51.345 --> 01:06:52.596
<i>I'm sorry for this, Pierre.</i>

01:06:53.013 --> 01:06:55.224
<i>Plus, I don't like nobody
messing with my money."</i>

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.318
I can exhale now.

01:07:08.028 --> 01:07:09.696
Game is over.

01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:17.162
So... I'm gonna help you out, though.

01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:19.957
We can handle this one of two ways.

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:24.169
The easy way or the hard way.

01:07:26.004 --> 01:07:27.089
So you agree to my terms.

01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:30.217
By the time I get to my car
and smoke my cigar...

01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:32.970
or me and little shorty
doo-wop short-stack there

01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:35.597
will just go to the authorities.

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.809
What do you say?

01:07:39.977 --> 01:07:42.104
Huh? Take your time.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.316
Okay, time is up.
What do you say?

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.988
- I'll agree to whatever you want.
- Whatever I want?

01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:53.907
Do you have a choice?

01:07:56.034 --> 01:07:59.580
Do you? No.
Offer you can't refuse, right?

01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:04.626
Just tell your attorney that you had
a change of heart.

01:08:07.337 --> 01:08:09.006
And when this is all over with...

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:11.967
don't come around me and Phenix again.

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:15.679
Just email us, send a homing pigeon,
or something.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:19.015
We'll get back to you.

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:21.935
You can leave now.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:31.612
What a day.

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:41.997
- Thanks, baby.
- You're welcome.

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:44.750
God, it's so pretty out here.

01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:50.130
- It's nice out.
- It is.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.221
You know
what I was just thinking?

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.932
What's that?

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:02.768
She had it all.

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:06.063
I mean, she had both the cars...

01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:11.068
both the houses.... the boat...

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:12.861
Hey, you should have kept the boat.

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:16.156
I should have kept the boat.
But, you know, we'll get another one.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.241
But...

01:09:19.326 --> 01:09:21.912
She got a problem.
She really has a problem.

01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:23.037
She's greedy.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:24.997
Yeah, she is.

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.835
At least we don't have to worry
about that no more.

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:30.462
Hey, going on with the second half
of our lives.

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:32.631
Mm-hmm. Finally.

01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:36.760
But you know what, I... whew...

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.761
I'm so glad I dodged that bullet...

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:40.514
...didn't get those women pregnant,
you know?

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:45.269
I'm sorry, that's the last time,
I promise you, but I had to get one more.

01:09:45.644 --> 01:09:48.104
- No, I deserve that, I deserve it.
- One more time...

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:51.817
- This is the one time you can do that.
- And I promise that's the last time.

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.944
- That's it, I'm done.
- No, I deserve that.

01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:57.322
Because... whoo, that'd have been tough.

01:09:57.406 --> 01:09:59.283
But you were really... whoo!

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.076
Whew!

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:03.328
- But you had my back, huh?
- Yeah, I mean...

01:10:03.412 --> 01:10:06.164
- You were really gonna squab with Dana.
- Yeah, I was about to fight Dana,

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:09.168
talkin' about I was all up in your ass,
yeah, mm-hmm,

01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:11.879
'cause I was about to be
all up in <i>her </i> ass, but I was cool.

01:10:11.962 --> 01:10:14.089
I kept it calm, I was good.

01:10:14.173 --> 01:10:17.092
- 'Cause you had my back.
- Haven't I always?

01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:19.720
I've always had your back.

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:22.181
And because of that...

01:10:27.519 --> 01:10:29.479
when this divorce is over...

01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:32.441
finally...

01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:34.693
Miss Phenix Summers...

01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:37.446
I wanna marry you.

01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:42.201
Would you marry me? Huh?

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.665
With your little dimples.
Look at you.

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:52.002
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Really?

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:54.463
It's what I've always wanted
since the second grade.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:57.382
See, like they say,
men take a little longer to grow,

01:10:57.466 --> 01:11:01.303
but I realize now how much I need you
and how much I love you.

01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:05.057
How much you been there for me,
how much you support me,

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.269
and how much I support you and...
and I don't wanna be without you.

01:11:10.854 --> 01:11:12.064
Come here.

01:11:17.736 --> 01:11:18.612
Come here.

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:31.041
We're going inside.

01:11:31.124 --> 01:11:32.626
I did get her husband.

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:36.463
You're such a bad girl.

01:11:36.547 --> 01:11:40.342
Oh, God, I'm bad.
That's all right.

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:41.552
Poor Dana.

01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:51.270
Closer!

01:11:51.353 --> 01:11:52.312
Argggh!

01:11:52.396 --> 01:11:54.481
Come out and claim it!

01:11:54.565 --> 01:11:55.983
There we go, right there!

01:11:56.066 --> 01:11:57.860
- Welcome back, bruh.
- What's up, big dawg?

01:11:57.943 --> 01:12:00.404
It's hard to get on that plane, man,
but it's good to be back.

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:04.616
Yeah, you must have had a ball 'cause
y'all been gone for like a month, man.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.618
That's the longest honeymoon ever, bruh.

01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:11.290
After all that drama, Phenix and I needed
to get away, center ourselves, man, so...

01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:13.083
- Yeah.
- Good times, man.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:15.961
Yeah, good time in that ass every night,
just rrrrrr!

01:12:16.044 --> 01:12:17.921
- Rrrrrr!
- Hey, that's my wife.

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:20.048
- Oh, okay, right.
- So that's not appropriate.

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:22.134
- No, it's not.
- So how's everything been going?

01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:24.595
- Yo, everything's going good, man.
- Really?

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:27.347
Kim and Karen out right now
checking out properties.

01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:30.309
- Okay.
- All your mail, packages and everything

01:12:30.392 --> 01:12:33.353
is sitting on your desk, and I got
a couple of guys coming over later

01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:36.273
to, you know,
tidy up some things around here, man.

01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:39.401
- Okay.
- I've been handling business, bruh.

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:42.529
And I've been closing, you know how I do.

01:12:42.863 --> 01:12:44.531
- So you been closing.
- Yeah.

01:12:44.615 --> 01:12:46.491
- "Sold by the closer."
- SBC.

01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:48.911
- "Sold by me."
- SBM.

01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.413
- Know that's unprofessional?
- It is professional.

01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:54.333
- The people wanted my autograph.
- "Home of the closer"?

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.835
- We're gonna take all this down.
- Hey, it's my house.

01:12:56.919 --> 01:13:00.088
- I knew you was gonna like that one.
- So, to see if you're well-rounded,

01:13:00.172 --> 01:13:02.841
you can open up something
and do it up from there.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.345
- What's this, man?
- Just open it.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.971
All right.

01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:10.140
Oh.

01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:13.685
You... you purchased another building?

01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:17.314
Yeah. What else it say?

01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:19.358
You for real, man?

01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:21.068
Congratulations, partner.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:23.904

01:13:23.987 --> 01:13:26.615
- Thanks, man-- I mean, partner.
- Partner.

01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:29.660
So we close next week
so you and I will go into particulars

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:32.829
about the partnership, all the paperwork,
but... it's all you, man.

01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:37.960
Whoo-whoo! Hey! Hey, yo.
This calls for a celebration, man.

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:41.922
- And Tuesday night, let's hit the club.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, about that.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:44.883
It is Tuesday?

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:46.635
- Huh? Yeah.
- However...

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.345
I'm retired, man.

01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:51.014
- What?
- Yeah, man, but we can still celebrate.

01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:53.934
Come by the house, we'll have Phenix
whip up some dinner, make some drinks,

01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:55.727
anybody you wanna bring.
We still could do that.

01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:58.355
Nobody wanna come
to your old punk-ass crib!

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.983
What are you talkin' about?
That's how we doin' it now?

01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:04.486
Sittin' across from you, man,
with them damn Michael Ealy eyes!

01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.572
Hey, listen, man.

01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:10.450
I'm never gettin' off.
I love the love train.

01:14:10.534 --> 01:14:12.619
I'm gonna ride it till
the wheels fall off, bruh.

01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:15.414
As you should, man, as you should.

01:14:15.497 --> 01:14:17.457
<i>♪ Choo-choo! ♪</i>
Ha ha!

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:21.837
Uh... For real though, man,
I appreciate you, though, for real.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.088
- Hey.
- Sho', man.

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:25.757
You deserve it, you did it. You got your
license, you've been boomin'...

01:14:26.133 --> 01:14:28.343
We're gonna take this down,
but I'm proud of you.

01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:30.095
Man. What? You ain't takin' nothin' down.

01:14:30.179 --> 01:14:32.181
Hey, I've been handling
business around here, bruh.

01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.725
- I'm great.
- Hey, babe.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.228
That's Rodney, I'm at the office.
Gave him the good news.

01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:39.271
Yeah.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:40.397
Huh?

01:14:41.148 --> 01:14:43.442
What, the honeymoon's not over, huh?
Okay.

01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:45.944
Well, I'm on my way home now.
I don't have to wait here.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:50.365
Oh, you wanna come to the office?
No, babe, Rodney's still here.

01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:53.869
So you're trying to tell me you don't care
if he walks in and sees us?

01:14:54.953 --> 01:14:56.997
Little freaky self, you know that's why
I love you.

01:14:57.748 --> 01:14:59.333
You got a fantasy?

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.294
You gonna be...

We got so much in common.
That's why I love you, babe.

Yeah, hold on.

- You say anything?
- No, I didn't say nothin'.

01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:22.231
- Who was that?
