WEBVTT

00:46.120 --> 00:48.580
Do you see the criminal
coming out behind me?

00:48.750 --> 00:50.186
After about a year since
the beginning of 2016

00:50.210 --> 00:55.130
the first extradition between the Philippines
and South Korea took place at 4 P.M. today.

00:55.210 --> 00:58.486
For the first time, 47 korean criminals
who absconded to the Philippines

00:58.510 --> 01:06.510
after committing crimes in Korea were
repatriated en masse by chartered flights.

01:07.230 --> 01:12.440
This is police using citizens special
forces and local motorcade personnel...

01:19.200 --> 01:23.700
Jong dongbi, you bastard!!

01:24.950 --> 01:27.266
What... stop him! Stop!

01:27.290 --> 01:27.897
Quick!

01:27.921 --> 01:29.080
You son of bitch!!

01:34.630 --> 01:36.076
Die with me!!

02:01.410 --> 02:05.750
2022

02:06.580 --> 02:09.106
September 12th, now.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.790
Burbad, Manila, Philippines.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.236
Korean criminals arrested in the Philippines
will be transported to Busan port

02:13.260 --> 02:16.656
in 2 days at 7 P.M. on 14th.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.180
By an international cargo ship departing
Manila container terminal at 5 P.M. today.

02:22.770 --> 02:28.310
Considering that a suicide bombing at
the airport during the first repatriation

02:28.360 --> 02:33.126
in 2017 killed seven police officers and
injured more than 30 airport passengers.

02:33.150 --> 02:38.846
The convoy decided to use cargo ship
terminals inaccessible to private citizens.

02:38.870 --> 02:42.346
Therefore, the national police agency, in
cooperation with the Busan port authority,

02:42.370 --> 02:48.016
designated the 58,000-ton bulk carrier
"frontier titan" as the escort vessel.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.276
About 20 criminal police officers
with more than 10 years of experience

02:52.300 --> 02:55.696
in violent cases were
assigned to escort the ship.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.076
The wanted criminals were
repatriated as red notice criminals,

02:58.100 --> 03:02.616
the highest ranking criminals by Interpol.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.520
Hey, isn't our operation secret?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.900
It was reported in the news.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.410
Good job.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.010
Stay close.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.090
Get off quickly.

03:37.430 --> 03:38.560
Quick, quick.

03:39.180 --> 03:41.270
Get out of the bus quickly.

03:41.310 --> 03:42.350
Get up.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.496
I'm just telling you to
spread your legs a bit.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.377
Get up quicky.

03:45.401 --> 03:46.560
Ok ok.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.190
Where?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.530
Let's go, let's go.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
Don't touch me, shit.

04:01.410 --> 04:02.750
Hey this way.

04:07.630 --> 04:10.880
Ah the smell of shit, f♪♪k.

04:13.800 --> 04:20.890
Lee dong ii, red scar,
Lee sang-moo, get on board!

04:22.140 --> 04:25.980
I thought you retired long ago.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.900
Your daughter has become a woman.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
Jungu.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.000
You stupid bastard.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.670
Since you're in school you
should listen to your teachers.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.170
What kind of attitude is that?

04:51.630 --> 04:55.140
I saw the photos and was very impressed.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.576
How the f♪♪k can the
Interpol beat a person up.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.980
This is not right.

05:12.950 --> 05:15.830
How come the wind is so strong?

05:19.450 --> 05:21.976
Let go, let go.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.330
Let me go, f♪♪k.

05:27.340 --> 05:28.420
Sorry.

05:29.170 --> 05:32.380
It's already a mess and
I want to go on a trip.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.260
Senior, what are those people for?

05:37.600 --> 05:40.350
It's a doctor and a nurse.

05:40.730 --> 05:43.650
It seems that all the korean
criminals are in the Philippines.

05:44.270 --> 05:48.626
It said the police hospital staff
couldn't get out, so yesterday I was...

05:48.650 --> 05:50.530
I'm already tired of it.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.450
Shouldn't I come?

05:54.030 --> 05:58.516
Let go of me, let go of me, you bastard.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.580
Tear him apart, the stupid bastard.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.380
- Ok ok.
- What the fuck are you guys looking at?

06:06.710 --> 06:07.710
Get on board.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.880
Yes.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.890
Hey you punk.

06:14.430 --> 06:17.270
Nice to meet you, let's go.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.910
Quick.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.546
What are you doing?

07:45.570 --> 07:46.570
What?

07:47.030 --> 07:48.280
What the hell are you doing?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.330
Attention.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.830
Attention!

07:57.000 --> 07:58.120
I'll keep it short.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.350
I am the leader of the central commando.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.856
Our team will be responsible for all
security control tasks in the border area.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.550
It is a prisoner escort
team from the Philippines.

08:06.840 --> 08:11.366
So you can go out the same door you
came to work through in the morning.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.100
No, hey.

08:12.180 --> 08:14.680
What are you barging in to say?

08:14.850 --> 08:17.270
I didn't get orders like that.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.110
I'm giving you the order now.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.490
I'll give you ten minutes.

08:29.070 --> 08:32.080
Project the vtos on the front
screen and prepare the setup.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.027
Project wolf hunting.

08:49.051 --> 08:51.430
Why can't we fly in a plane?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.076
Let go of me.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.966
What's all this bullshit
about getting on a plane.

09:03.990 --> 09:07.030
Dumb shit.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.926
Just let us go like this.

09:08.950 --> 09:10.280
Shut up, dumbass.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.420
Get in.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.290
Be gentle, be gentle.

09:21.050 --> 09:26.630
Murder under article 250 of the
penal code, on or about April 23, 2013.

09:27.050 --> 09:30.786
According to the principle of secularism,
from now on, this ship is korean territory

09:30.810 --> 09:32.810
and does not belong to
the Philippines anymore.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.020
Park jung-do.

09:36.350 --> 09:44.350
September 12, 16:20, according to
article 250 of the criminal code, 12, 1,

09:46.820 --> 09:51.330
you are a teacher who raped and
killed 13 people, 300 weeks escape time.

09:52.830 --> 09:57.830
Sorry officer, I've been
having trouble with my ankle.

09:58.170 --> 10:00.000
Can you help me unshackle my feet?

10:01.920 --> 10:07.510
Do soo-hwa, 261 incidents
of special atrocities.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.770
Interpol red list.

10:13.100 --> 10:21.100
In short, you can get a lawyer to represent
you, appeal, and apply for a denial of arrest.

10:22.650 --> 10:23.650
Ok?

10:32.540 --> 10:34.040
Oh f♪♪k

10:34.710 --> 10:37.170
it's going to be like
that all the way to Korea.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.420
Hey, be gentle, you bitch.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.840
Who do you think I am?

10:47.260 --> 10:49.220
Hey, don't touch me.

10:49.600 --> 10:54.230
Hey, be gentle. My skin is very delicate.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.047
Choi myong-joo.

10:58.071 --> 11:03.530
You are accused of killing your spouse and
in-laws under article 250 of the penal code.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.370
Attention!!

11:16.420 --> 11:22.316
Meals twice a day, bathroom once a day,
and no toothbrush for the safety of all.

11:22.340 --> 11:26.260
Ah... what the f♪♪k.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.956
I don't understand what human rights
are because I'm with such dumbasses.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.310
There is no cctv here either.

11:32.850 --> 11:38.126
So, if you want to eat well before
returning to your long-lost homeland.

11:38.150 --> 11:41.690
Just please, don't toss and
turn, and behave yourselves.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.820
If they roll up and leave,
you won't just be hungry.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.830
Thanks for your hard
work, this side is ready.

11:50.870 --> 11:54.170
Okay, we will leave the port as soon as
we get permission from the control center.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.760
All sections, stand by.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.890
Everyone has done their homework, right?

12:07.010 --> 12:11.060
Don't forget the emergency rule that you
can't take your eyes off all these people

12:11.560 --> 12:12.866
even one second before you arrive.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.246
What happened last time, even
if you don't say it, we all know.

12:15.270 --> 12:18.360
Do not let your guard down, got it?

12:18.980 --> 12:20.530
Yes, sir.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.040
Greetings, captain. This is the
Busan port special control office.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.266
Please always make sure the
vfc remains on channel 16.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.016
Mbdp transmission and
reception are confirmed.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.880
I have also contacted the local
miccs in the Philippines and Taiwan.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.090
The ship's security alarm
system is operating normally.

12:39.210 --> 12:43.550
"Frontier titan" departed
promptly at 17:00 philippine time.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.180
The tugboat is below.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.820
I saw it.

12:59.690 --> 13:01.700
Did you bring a lot of money?

13:05.700 --> 13:08.250
I don't think so.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.510
Ah yes.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.640
Doctor, maybe you brought
something like alcohol?

13:28.430 --> 13:30.576
No, I can't drink.

13:30.600 --> 13:35.480
What a shame, I would have
loved to have a refreshing beer.

13:36.570 --> 13:37.610
What to do?

13:43.030 --> 13:46.910
There are only 5 weeks
left until I go home.

13:47.330 --> 13:50.580
Our youngest must have
forgotten all about his father's face.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.210
Why are we doing this?

13:52.460 --> 13:53.500
Ah, shit.

13:53.670 --> 13:55.750
Don't get annoyed.

13:56.880 --> 14:00.050
It's like ordering
seolleon in the west sea.

14:00.510 --> 14:03.100
These criminals have a good life.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.746
Feed them, put them to
sleep, and get them for free.

14:06.770 --> 14:07.850
These pussies.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.270
I know you are annoyed
and sensitive, but bear with it.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.690
Just three days, just three days.

14:12.860 --> 14:13.747
Good.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.320
You go inside and take a break.

14:15.780 --> 14:17.110
We'll get the meal done.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.490
Ok.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.250
Hello.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.500
Are you the doctor?

14:29.830 --> 14:30.830
Yeah, yeah.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.766
We're cooking right now.

14:32.790 --> 14:33.340
No.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.840
I'll will take it away.

14:37.670 --> 14:38.356
I'm off.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.317
Okay.

14:39.341 --> 14:41.066
Take care of da-yeon and
seo-joon, they take care of your meals

14:41.090 --> 14:43.447
because there are no
shifts for them to do it.

14:43.471 --> 14:48.060
Ah, thank you both for your help.

14:50.650 --> 14:51.900
Good bye brother.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.350
Okay, got it.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.520
Red slow.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.520
Yes, we are now heading out for departure.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.296
Well, let's eat first.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.047
Thanks.

16:17.071 --> 16:18.351
There's something for us, right?

16:21.660 --> 16:23.580
Hey man, it's delcious.

16:23.830 --> 16:24.830
That's how you do it.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.250
Hey, don't fart, eat well.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.420
Ok.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.140
It's too noisy.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.200
Eat.

17:02.410 --> 17:03.410
Move your legs away.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.750
Move your legs you stupid cunt.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.170
You're still laughing?

17:09.380 --> 17:11.210
Isn't that crazy, stupid.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.100
You eat.

17:28.940 --> 17:29.980
Here you go.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.280
Cross-legged.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.620
Cross-legged.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.660
Are you the only one to drink?

18:31.090 --> 18:32.090
Got it.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.666
Ah, let's go.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.297
- Is that okay?
- Excuse me.

19:05.670 --> 19:06.710
Hello.

19:08.550 --> 19:13.130
I ate and brought you something.

20:33.590 --> 20:34.680
Oh...

20:47.900 --> 20:50.530
Do I just... need to put sleeping pills in?

20:54.330 --> 20:56.716
Can I touch it directly with my hand?

20:56.740 --> 20:58.250
Don't think too much.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.750
Just finish what you have to do and leave.

21:55.020 --> 22:02.270
Currently, latitude 18.6, longitude
189.38, cruising speed 12 knots.

22:03.730 --> 22:05.900
It has passed through the high seas.

22:06.780 --> 22:07.860
Current weather conditions?

22:09.070 --> 22:12.580
A rainstorm warning has been issued
from philipine waters until the buoy.

22:13.870 --> 22:19.186
It is expected to advance 30 per hour with a
wind speed of 13.5m, equivalent to 4th level.

22:19.210 --> 22:20.880
That's enough.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.016
Just pay attention to safety,
there are no flammable

22:23.040 --> 22:24.686
and explosive materials
in the cargo hold, right?

22:24.710 --> 22:28.220
None. Only cement and iron ore.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.710
In seven minutes, we will enter the
international waters of titano, border titano.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.796
Twelve years have passed.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.416
The child was born.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.166
I carried him around.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.740
Patrolling around, lurking around.

22:49.030 --> 22:53.636
It's really crazy that it took
about 2 weeks to catch.

22:53.660 --> 22:56.460
Brother, do you know
where you caught him from?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.330
You know busking, right?

23:00.920 --> 23:07.566
Lately the kids have been singing
and dancing and playing instruments.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.527
Busking?

23:08.551 --> 23:10.140
Yeah, busking.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.156
That's where he was caught.

23:12.180 --> 23:15.640
Hey, these people have
no reason but have sense.

23:15.850 --> 23:17.270
Don't mention it.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.320
But it's not like this guy
has a cell phone or anything.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.876
So I asked, "where's your cell phone?"

23:24.900 --> 23:26.876
Turns out he said he left
it in the bathroom at home.

23:26.900 --> 23:27.506
The bathroom?

23:27.530 --> 23:28.087
Yeah.

23:28.111 --> 23:35.476
I went to look for it, and it
was behind the bathroom door.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.580
There were three of us.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.090
Gotcha! Number 3!

23:48.470 --> 23:50.640
Panicked and surprised again, right?

23:54.850 --> 23:55.850
Scared?

24:09.200 --> 24:17.200
Just grab him at once, shake shake.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.170
Did I make a mistake? That
was already three years ago.

25:00.210 --> 25:02.500
Until now

25:06.420 --> 25:08.356
look at this

25:08.380 --> 25:10.380
how is this

25:10.910 --> 25:13.850
look at this.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.836
What a life this is. I'm going to bed.

25:34.860 --> 25:37.066
But it's almost time
for my shift. I'm so tired.

25:37.090 --> 25:39.710
So why start playing cards.

25:41.460 --> 25:42.920
Shit.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.180
What's that?

25:52.310 --> 25:55.150
Ah you stupid bastard.

25:57.110 --> 25:59.940
I told you to put the gun
in, what are you looking at.

26:01.110 --> 26:04.030
Good evening.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.450
Shit.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.660
You can't watch movies
in foreign countries.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.080
Am I the only one?

26:15.380 --> 26:16.840
F♪♪k.

26:17.460 --> 26:21.380
What the hell.

27:39.130 --> 27:42.890
He took out all the
boxes for the prisoners.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.720
I would really be crazy if
it wasn't for president Jo.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.456
They are the police,
they should get this right.

27:49.480 --> 27:50.230
That's right.

27:50.350 --> 27:51.520
It's a police matter.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.020
Okay.

27:57.150 --> 27:59.836
So when is it going to rain?

27:59.860 --> 28:01.386
Then the song will be interrupted again.

28:01.410 --> 28:06.040
It says it's going to rain at
09:00. It's to going to come.

28:07.580 --> 28:08.620
What's the matter?

28:21.300 --> 28:23.020
It takes you guys to drive the ship, right?

28:24.600 --> 28:25.640
Yes, yes.

28:38.780 --> 28:39.990
Turn on the roof light.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.520
Where's the contact signal
coming from on the korean side?

28:48.120 --> 28:49.120
There.

29:36.420 --> 29:37.470
What?

29:38.590 --> 29:39.720
How did this happen?

29:44.180 --> 29:45.180
Team leader.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.810
The signal was cut off.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.640
What does that mean?

29:49.810 --> 29:51.626
It looks like it disappeared.

29:51.650 --> 29:53.756
What are you talking about?

29:53.780 --> 29:55.070
Is it an ais malfunction?

29:55.940 --> 29:57.400
Hurry up and connect to the vhf.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.910
Yes, got it.

30:08.290 --> 30:11.710
What about the security alert system?

30:13.390 --> 30:14.586
There was little response.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.650
I think it was cut off
without an emergency signal.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.226
I can't connect to vhf.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.340
Since both are disconnected from the ais,

30:23.020 --> 30:24.620
I don't think it's a mere fault problem.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.196
Dumbass, did I ask what you think?

30:26.220 --> 30:28.216
Did I, punk?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.026
Don't think you're so good that you
have to teach me how to do things.

30:30.050 --> 30:34.370
Don't just bring up problems, bring up
countermeasures. What about countermeasures?

30:34.440 --> 30:37.980
Call ima to reset the satellite signal.

30:38.110 --> 30:38.836
Got it?

30:38.860 --> 30:40.090
Roger that.

31:13.650 --> 31:17.160
A1, a1, f, are you there?

31:18.660 --> 31:21.006
What's wrong? Is something suddenly wrong?

31:21.030 --> 31:22.710
The signal seems to be bad. Wait a minute.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.410
This is a1 Lee dayeon.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.080
Is f there?

31:27.420 --> 31:28.670
Team leader Lee seong-ho?

31:29.710 --> 31:31.840
Anyone who can hear me, please reply.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.630
A1, a1.

31:37.390 --> 31:40.970
Please reply. What to
reply you bunch of idiots.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.996
I'll go find the team leader
first, i-'ll be back in a minute.

31:47.020 --> 31:51.916
It's not like it's been a malfunction
twice, so don't run around.

31:51.940 --> 31:53.570
Don't get into trouble.

31:55.070 --> 31:56.070
Senior.

31:57.570 --> 32:00.030
Suit yourself.

32:00.830 --> 32:06.920
Hey, is there a young
male detective? Please.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.960
F♪♪king bitch.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.340
What the heck.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.456
A1, a1.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.440
Will you shut up?

32:32.110 --> 32:35.740
But sister, my stomach hurts a little.

32:38.410 --> 32:40.370
Can I go to the bathroom?

32:43.710 --> 32:45.000
Hey.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.420
Yes we are sitting down.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.170
Don't sleep.

33:11.070 --> 33:13.150
Hey, what's up?

33:15.410 --> 33:17.160
I asked you what you're doing?

33:19.740 --> 33:21.910
Shit, hey.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.130
Sorry sorry sorry.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.800
What the hell? Are you crazy?

33:36.350 --> 33:38.010
Who are you?

33:40.900 --> 33:42.310
Douchebags.

34:28.110 --> 34:30.900
Ah f♪♪k, what a pain in the ass.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.896
I already checked the
location you mentioned,

34:42.920 --> 34:44.880
there's no problems
with the site right now.

34:45.340 --> 34:47.670
None of the other ships
around made a claim.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.276
Did you check the problem inside the ship?

34:50.300 --> 34:53.366
I'm not sure but... we're checking
everything might happened.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.406
I don't think there's
problem inside the ship.

34:55.430 --> 34:56.446
Emergency situation occurred!

34:56.470 --> 34:57.810
Emergency situation occurred!

35:14.490 --> 35:15.580
Help.

35:20.830 --> 35:21.830
Brother.

35:30.510 --> 35:32.430
Let them go first, I
guess they are all waiting.

35:32.930 --> 35:33.930
Okay.

35:34.350 --> 35:35.350
Wait.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.440
Give me the knife.

36:01.210 --> 36:03.040
Except for the guys on the phone right now.

36:03.630 --> 36:08.510
The others find the satellite image
of the ship from the last position.

36:09.010 --> 36:11.390
Look for the Chinese or
Japanese meteorological agency,

36:11.800 --> 36:13.100
or anything that can find them.

36:14.220 --> 36:15.520
Make sure you catch them.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.840
How nice.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.890
1, 2, 3.1, 2, 3.

37:38.730 --> 37:41.900
Can anyone hear me? Please reply.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.900
A1, a1, seniors.

37:59.540 --> 38:00.540
Oh.

38:00.630 --> 38:01.630
Don't move.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.300
I'm a doctor, doctor.

38:04.420 --> 38:07.197
- I know, but why did you come out of there?
- Ah.

38:10.010 --> 38:14.980
Lee dayeon, what are you doing in
there? Why did you take the gun out?

38:16.520 --> 38:17.690
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.060
I'm sorry, doctor.

38:19.270 --> 38:20.470
She was trying to do her duty.

38:21.400 --> 38:26.176
I've been looking for leader. Is everyone's
Internet and walkie-talkies down?

38:26.200 --> 38:28.910
Yes, none of ours are working,
so we're going to make sure.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.080
There's someone over there.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.370
Brother, over there.

38:35.870 --> 38:36.870
What's he doing.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.146
Isn't that an axe he's holding?

38:39.170 --> 38:41.590
These fools really, over there.

38:49.640 --> 38:53.560
What am I going to do?

39:00.610 --> 39:01.610
Let's go.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.620
Thank you, thank you.

39:16.460 --> 39:18.790
Only now it feels alive.

39:23.170 --> 39:24.300
Thank you.

39:30.560 --> 39:34.390
Who gave you this special f♪♪king pardon?

39:35.480 --> 39:38.690
Hey, where are the pussies?

39:40.230 --> 39:42.240
One of them is cute.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.200
Hey, wanna come along?

39:45.410 --> 39:46.426
F♪♪k off.

39:46.450 --> 39:49.160
Hey, you want to go too?

40:05.430 --> 40:06.680
That bitch is mine.

40:07.390 --> 40:08.430
Jung do.

40:10.220 --> 40:12.730
What are these idiots doing.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.440
It's been a long time
since I've used it. It's nice.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.360
Who's this?

40:23.280 --> 40:26.620
You know that artist too, right?

40:28.030 --> 40:30.700
He doesn't need a knife either.
He's a gentlemen, Lee dong-il.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.710
It's really alarming to
see you look so pathetic.

40:36.330 --> 40:38.000
I haven't seen it in about 10 years.

40:40.260 --> 40:41.920
How come you haven't seen it once?

40:42.670 --> 40:44.010
What are you doing now?

40:44.890 --> 40:45.890
Can't you see it?

40:47.050 --> 40:48.930
I'm running away in
order to live like a human.

40:54.230 --> 40:57.166
But you stinking idiot, I saved
you, you should say thank you.

40:57.190 --> 40:58.666
You ungrateful douche bag.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.290
Just be a good boy and go back to Korea.

41:00.900 --> 41:04.780
Don't do something you regret.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.410
What kind of pussy talk is that?

41:11.960 --> 41:14.080
Are there any dumbasses
here who want to go to Korea?

41:16.340 --> 41:17.340
Raise you hand.

41:17.930 --> 41:19.840
It's gonna be so easy.

41:56.750 --> 41:57.750
What are you doing?

42:03.430 --> 42:05.550
You son of a bitch.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.060
Shit

42:13.770 --> 42:14.860
don't move.

42:17.860 --> 42:18.860
Senior.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.940
I told you to be gentle.

42:57.230 --> 43:01.740
Anyway, I can't listen to
anything when I'm excited.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.096
Brother, just help us wash the dishes.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.710
Why do I have to do the dishes every day?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.710
I'll take care of myong-joo
when I'm doing it.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.090
If that's the case, it's already messed up.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.920
You know how to go back, right.

43:31.440 --> 43:35.980
Those who want to follow will
come, those who don't want to follow,

43:39.660 --> 43:41.020
watch out for themselves, damn it.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.460
See you soon.

43:52.130 --> 43:55.380
Shit, I was going to kill him.

44:04.850 --> 44:07.140
But it's still going to Korea.

44:08.390 --> 44:12.230
It's going crazy how things
have turned out this way.

45:03.540 --> 45:06.370
Ah shit, these idiots
are really getting to me.

45:06.790 --> 45:10.920
Your people are dead, what are
you going to do, you stupid cunt.

45:12.420 --> 45:16.470
What are you talking about? Your
people are dead you stupid cunt.

45:16.760 --> 45:20.100
By now jung-do should have
finished the job beautifully.

45:20.680 --> 45:24.020
Park jung-do... crazy bastard.

45:37.780 --> 45:38.780
Drop the gun.

45:43.870 --> 45:44.960
Put the gun down!!

45:55.970 --> 45:57.550
Stand up.

46:18.990 --> 46:20.120
Lee dayeon take cover.

46:35.630 --> 46:36.630
Is everything okay?

47:00.580 --> 47:01.700
Are you okay?

47:03.330 --> 47:07.460
I know you're tired, is there
any way to reach Korea?

47:08.750 --> 47:11.460
Engine room, satellite phone.

47:11.710 --> 47:12.920
Hmm?

47:30.650 --> 47:31.900
That was gunfire, wasn't it?

47:32.860 --> 47:34.700
How did you hear the sound of gunfire?

47:35.320 --> 47:36.780
Must have been fixing something.

47:36.990 --> 47:38.330
But where did you get the beer?

47:39.240 --> 47:41.136
When I went to the
restaurant, there was beer there.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.476
Would you like to join me for a drink?

47:42.500 --> 47:44.040
No, I can't drink.

47:45.830 --> 47:47.226
But where have you been?

47:47.250 --> 47:49.670
Oh, down there. That's not important.

47:49.710 --> 47:51.146
That's the sound of gunfire.

47:51.170 --> 47:53.840
On my way here, I met the
interrogators with their guns.

47:56.140 --> 47:59.196
If you're so worried, I'll go
out and see what's going on.

47:59.220 --> 48:00.470
Don't go out there.

48:00.770 --> 48:02.826
There are a lot of criminals out there.

48:02.850 --> 48:04.480
How can a doctor be so timid.

48:04.730 --> 48:06.980
You're not very attractive
to women, are you, doctor?

48:12.110 --> 48:14.160
What a lack of charm.

48:14.950 --> 48:16.450
You have so little guts.

48:17.450 --> 48:18.540
It's okay, it's okay.

48:21.160 --> 48:23.580
The fortune teller said this
year that I have bad fortune.

48:25.130 --> 48:26.670
You really do everything.

48:33.090 --> 48:35.850
If it's so good, why don't you drink it.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.570
You have worked hard.

48:54.530 --> 48:55.830
It's all moved over.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.080
Good.

49:08.670 --> 49:10.970
No soju now.

49:13.890 --> 49:17.260
You smoke a cigarette
and go somewhere nice.

50:31.180 --> 50:33.680
Now this is not a problem, right?

50:36.560 --> 50:39.940
You guys can't come down
here for that. Please go up.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.960
It's okay, don't be afraid.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.130
Where's the satellite phone?

51:05.420 --> 51:06.710
Ec.

51:07.420 --> 51:09.356
Say something understandable, dammit.

51:09.380 --> 51:12.640
Engine control room over there.

51:15.890 --> 51:19.850
Those two guys, you go
over there and smash it.

51:23.440 --> 51:24.440
You go along too.

52:19.460 --> 52:20.460
Seniors.

52:22.300 --> 52:23.300
What?

52:24.670 --> 52:25.526
F♪♪k.

52:25.550 --> 52:26.550
Where did they all go?

52:36.390 --> 52:37.520
Where are the others?

52:39.520 --> 52:40.650
I don't know.

52:41.610 --> 52:43.450
We acted immediately
after we heard the shots.

52:43.820 --> 52:46.320
The bastards ended up in trouble.

52:47.570 --> 52:49.120
Communications were all cut off too.

52:50.200 --> 52:55.160
They were prepared
before they got on the ship.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.120
We need to tell the korean
side of the situation first.

52:59.790 --> 53:03.170
It says that the engine
room can contact with Korea.

53:29.450 --> 53:30.870
Why did you bring this uncle?

53:31.040 --> 53:34.210
Without me, the boat would have stopped.

53:40.130 --> 53:42.026
That's what they said.

53:42.050 --> 53:44.260
I'm the chief engineer.

53:46.130 --> 53:50.220
Forget it, get him done, let's go.

53:50.510 --> 53:51.510
Good.

53:51.850 --> 53:53.020
Let's go.

53:54.270 --> 53:55.310
Uncle you get off work.

54:08.740 --> 54:09.830
What are you doing?

54:10.620 --> 54:11.620
Don't go too far.

54:15.040 --> 54:17.290
Park jung-do, you jerk.

54:22.090 --> 54:24.930
This dumbass.

54:25.590 --> 54:27.010
You can't shoot here.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.220
The boat will stop.

54:28.350 --> 54:29.736
There's an engine here.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.470
It's noisy, you stupid bastard.

54:33.560 --> 54:36.860
F♪♪k, can the police
shoot at people like that?

54:38.150 --> 54:40.690
It's self-defense from
now on, you assholes.

54:42.070 --> 54:44.530
I'm not from this side! Please help me.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.550
Kids, take care of them.

55:19.690 --> 55:21.900
What is it? Still alive?

55:22.700 --> 55:24.200
Nobody move!

55:26.410 --> 55:31.726
I'm sure it's this style,
how can you not die.

55:31.750 --> 55:34.120
Don't look, don't look.

55:36.250 --> 55:41.316
I said don't move, dumbass.

55:41.340 --> 55:45.300
Jung-do, I told you, this is
not a boat you can escape from.

55:46.510 --> 55:49.850
I'm so mad, who's the one
who should escape now?

55:51.430 --> 55:53.400
Stick a knife in your
mouth, for f♪♪k's sake.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.610
F♪♪k!

55:58.610 --> 55:59.690
Stupid motherf♪♪ker!

56:20.050 --> 56:22.760
Hide, hide!

57:28.910 --> 57:30.250
Shit!

58:30.650 --> 58:32.060
Brother, brother, quick.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.820
Shit.

58:36.150 --> 58:38.280
Out of the way, damn it.

59:10.610 --> 59:11.980
Stinky bitch, shit.

59:19.660 --> 59:21.330
F♪♪k all of you, you stupid bastards.

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:58.200
F♪♪k you.

1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:54.840
Nothing is different.

1:01:56.190 --> 1:01:57.490
This is hell.

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:38.690
Hurry up.

1:02:39.380 --> 1:02:40.720
There is a exit.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.000
Just shoot.

1:03:18.670 --> 1:03:19.670
Come on.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:33.820
Hurry up.

1:04:03.970 --> 1:04:08.720
His prison clothes are very old.

1:04:09.630 --> 1:04:13.170
I have been in prison for 30 years.

1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:15.580
We should get treatment.

1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:18.820
Let's go.

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:26.440
Officer.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:29.200
A photo is sent to us by mrcc
from the sea area near Taiwan.

1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:31.500
The location is finally
captured very near from us.

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:33.400
Enlarge the photo.

1:04:37.190 --> 1:04:37.730
When is it sent?

1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:39.160
About 30 minutes ago.

1:04:39.990 --> 1:04:41.630
It doesn't look like the ship is sinking.

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.480
Enlarge more.

1:04:46.930 --> 1:04:48.680
The stern looks fine.

1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:51.550
What is that?

1:04:51.710 --> 1:04:52.780
Why is it red over there?

1:04:53.980 --> 1:04:55.270
Enlarge that area.

1:05:01.010 --> 1:05:03.340
F♪♪k.

1:05:04.210 --> 1:05:07.630
I knew. The criminals are going to do evil.

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:14.906
What is the police doing on the ship?

1:05:14.930 --> 1:05:16.400
Son of a bitch.

1:05:31.890 --> 1:05:33.300
Director pyo

1:05:39.250 --> 1:05:40.250
Report?

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:42.040
You are joking.

1:05:42.510 --> 1:05:43.830
You are too arrogant.

1:05:44.060 --> 1:05:48.050
I am doing my job as you have asked.

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:49.347
I already knew about the situation.

1:05:49.371 --> 1:05:50.510
The situation?

1:05:51.470 --> 1:05:52.560
Don't talk too much.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.060
Just make it simple.

1:05:55.070 --> 1:05:56.920
Officer oh, you should
go there by yourself.

1:05:57.190 --> 1:05:58.860
Go there by myself? Me?

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:01.490
The ship is coming now.

1:06:01.980 --> 1:06:05.520
Oh my, you are really out of you mind.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:08.640
Do you think coastguards and
ministry of defense will support us?

1:06:09.470 --> 1:06:13.280
There are dozens of people on
that ship. How can I catch that guy?

1:06:14.350 --> 1:06:15.696
You should say something realistic.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:22.190
It was you who said it's fine to let
him get on the ship and lose all faculties.

1:06:23.530 --> 1:06:24.866
It was you who said...

1:06:24.890 --> 1:06:26.890
F♪♪k. Then what do you want me to do?

1:06:28.060 --> 1:06:29.700
I only said Alpha should get on the ship.

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:31.526
I didn't say the criminals
should be there too.

1:06:31.550 --> 1:06:34.100
Now things have gone really bad.

1:06:35.830 --> 1:06:37.110
But why should that blame on me?

1:06:37.580 --> 1:06:39.680
It's you that pretend to know nothing.

1:06:40.350 --> 1:06:41.486
What do you want me to do?

1:06:41.510 --> 1:06:43.000
Son of a bitch.

1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:00.840
Listen.

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:05.200
The naval base you will see in
front of it belongs to the U.S. army.

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:08.900
Just shut up.

1:07:10.310 --> 1:07:11.840
And bring Alpha to me.

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.750
Hey, you son of a bitch.

1:07:16.540 --> 1:07:17.540
Hey.

1:07:21.980 --> 1:07:22.980
F♪♪k.

1:07:50.270 --> 1:07:51.270
Son of a bitch.

1:07:52.010 --> 1:07:53.810
Shut up.

1:08:07.570 --> 1:08:08.217
You have no manners.

1:08:08.241 --> 1:08:09.641
You should knock on the door first.

1:08:10.570 --> 1:08:12.610
Is it your first time seeing
someone in the toilet?

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:14.160
Why are you so late?

1:08:16.610 --> 1:08:17.610
Tell me the truth.

1:08:17.940 --> 1:08:18.940
Did you forget me?

1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:20.360
What are you talking about?

1:08:21.550 --> 1:08:22.910
All in all, I came.

1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:24.760
Nonsense.

1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:27.240
Hello.

1:08:27.330 --> 1:08:28.680
Hi.

1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:31.510
What's that all over your body.

1:08:31.630 --> 1:08:34.976
F♪♪k, you're driving
me crazy. Just stop it.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.320
Hey.

1:08:36.430 --> 1:08:38.470
I gave you money, right?

1:08:38.540 --> 1:08:40.510
Shit. Can you see this?

1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:42.220
Can you?

1:08:42.350 --> 1:08:43.350
Can you?

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:45.090
You should have done it well.

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:49.400
Turn around.

1:08:51.370 --> 1:08:53.630
Why are you always sitting at here?

1:08:54.220 --> 1:08:55.850
I need to change my clothes.

1:08:56.350 --> 1:08:57.410
But I don't have any.

1:08:58.200 --> 1:08:59.740
You crazy bitch.

1:09:00.090 --> 1:09:01.100
Help me with this.

1:09:09.490 --> 1:09:10.756
What a psycho.

1:09:10.780 --> 1:09:11.876
Don't follow me.

1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:13.656
You said you would help me.

1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:14.700
When?

1:09:24.810 --> 1:09:25.810
Hurry up.

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:49.990
What's going on?

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:53.760
You were nervous too much.

1:09:59.620 --> 1:10:01.580
Why do you sleep in my room?

1:10:07.740 --> 1:10:10.066
Sir, wake up.

1:10:10.090 --> 1:10:12.000
I heard something weird.

1:10:12.130 --> 1:10:13.870
Is it the sound of shooting?

1:10:15.150 --> 1:10:16.430
You always say it's shooting.

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:18.280
No, it's not.

1:10:22.050 --> 1:10:23.930
It sounds like wailing.

1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:27.870
Or maybe it's something fell down.

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:43.880
It's lifeboat.

1:10:45.450 --> 1:10:48.640
But why is it loosened?

1:11:24.050 --> 1:11:25.256
Help! Help!

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:27.040
Sir, what's going on?

1:11:27.230 --> 1:11:28.560
There's no time.

1:11:28.830 --> 1:11:29.830
He's chasing after me.

1:11:29.910 --> 1:11:31.176
Just let me go.

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.060
He did that in front of me.

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:36.590
Why are you always treating me like this?

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:37.940
Calm down.

1:11:39.810 --> 1:11:41.140
What did you just say?

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:42.780
She's dead.

1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:46.970
He's in the medical room now.

1:11:47.670 --> 1:11:49.370
It's there undoubtedly.

1:11:49.550 --> 1:11:50.790
I gave hypnotic...

1:11:52.890 --> 1:11:53.890
Say it clear.

1:11:54.790 --> 1:12:02.210
The monster's eyes are sewed up just like a
dead body and he wears the clothes like that.

1:12:05.130 --> 1:12:06.270
What's that?

1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:07.560
Tell us everything.

1:12:08.130 --> 1:12:09.130
I have no idea.

1:12:09.670 --> 1:12:10.810
I just follow the orders.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:13.020
What are you asked to do, bastard?

1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:22.400
I took annual leave.

1:12:23.550 --> 1:12:27.836
He asked me to give hypnotic every
six hours and offered me a lot of money.

1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:30.490
I only followed the order.

1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:34.780
Is it the association?

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:36.100
Yes.

1:12:36.260 --> 1:12:41.700
Is it the place that sells you vitamins
that makes you ten years younger?

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:43.140
Yes.

1:12:45.950 --> 1:12:47.870
There are faculties from
the company in my room.

1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:49.580
They probably know about this.

1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.690
Whatever.

1:12:54.510 --> 1:12:57.970
There's medicine on the lifeboat, right?

1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:01.940
Yes, but it is destroyed.

1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.060
Oh no.

1:13:09.030 --> 1:13:13.030
I have put some in the basement.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.100
Go check it.

1:13:17.510 --> 1:13:19.200
I will find others.

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:20.840
Alone?

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:23.720
No, it's too dangerous.

1:13:24.410 --> 1:13:25.097
I will go with you.

1:13:25.121 --> 1:13:26.290
It's all right.

1:13:28.110 --> 1:13:31.090
There should be at least
one police to go and search.

1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:35.360
However...

1:13:38.470 --> 1:13:39.470
Let's go.

1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:42.920
Let's hurry up.

1:14:04.730 --> 1:14:06.810
Jung du is in the engine room.

1:14:07.220 --> 1:14:08.320
My jung du.

1:14:09.050 --> 1:14:11.310
He finally can get out of the jail.

1:14:11.790 --> 1:14:15.510
Although he is rude,
he is quite clever, right?

1:14:57.870 --> 1:14:59.820
What the hell, you son of a bitch.

1:15:28.490 --> 1:15:29.630
Who are you?

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:32.600
Let's leave.
