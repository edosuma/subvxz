<i> We're down to two.</i>

Rod, he just, he couldn't
take it anymore.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.013
-[trish b] we're gonna
miss him.
-[jeremy] we will.

00:14.081 --> 00:17.449
-[trish] we're gonna feel it.
We're feeling the loss.
-Already.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.618
[trish] I would've gladly
stayed sandwiched

00:19.620 --> 00:21.420
In this bed with him
if he would've stayed.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.023
[jeremy speaking]

00:24.025 --> 00:27.860
-[jeremy] it's the hardest

-[trish] yup.

[jake n] <i> we are in our</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:34.233
Freezing my balls off.
Um, got the shivers.

00:34.301 --> 00:37.202
Nothing that I do
gets me warm.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.305
I don't care how big
this fire gets.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.609
Look how many times
we cover up.

Can't see joe.
Joe, can you see behind me?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.822
Come in over my shoulder, joe.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.758
It's like
giving birth. [laughs]

00:59.827 --> 01:01.627
Pop your little head out.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.562
There we go.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.631
[ky] this is legit
cold outside,

01:05.633 --> 01:08.600
And we are toasty warm.

[cougar growling]

01:27.721 --> 01:29.354

01:30.558 --> 01:31.957
[cougar growling]

01:45.439 --> 01:48.307
[ky] it's always good
to be, like checking out
the snow, huh?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.944
To see what's around us

[narrator] <i> high up on</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:17.636
[joe] <i> I was dehydrated,</i>

02:17.738 --> 02:19.805

02:21.909 --> 02:24.510
Gabby and ky, they've been

02:28.516 --> 02:30.516
-[ky] wow.
-[gabby]
that's definitely cat.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.051
[ky sighs] 100%.

02:33.053 --> 02:37.222
[gabby] all over the place.
They're, like, perfect prints.

02:37.224 --> 02:40.859
One of the things that's
really quick and easy
to identify

02:40.961 --> 02:44.229
A cat track, is they have
retractable claws.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.398
<i> So, on the track,</i>
<i> if there's no claws,</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:48.200

<i> be a cat.</i>

02:48.903 --> 02:50.035
Oh!

02:50.804 --> 02:52.804
Holy [bleep]!

02:52.806 --> 02:55.007
That's fresh.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.574
[gabby] that is fresh.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.510
-[ky] holy cow.
-I mean, the ligaments
are still working 'cause its,

02:58.512 --> 03:00.812
Its hip joint's
in there still.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.714
-[gabby] let's not take
this back to camp.
-No.

03:02.716 --> 03:06.318
[ky] I don't think we want
any trace of any animal scent
in there.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.786
[gabby] damn.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.354
[ky] we just get vigilant

03:09.423 --> 03:12.157
On making sure
if we're out here,
we have a partner,

03:12.193 --> 03:14.226
-Right.
-Even if it means one stays
in the shelter

03:14.228 --> 03:15.794
-Or we all three come out,
-right.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.563
Or we carry the bow and arrow.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.464
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> this is a serious threat.</i>

03:28.509 --> 03:29.942
[jermaine j] <i> we've done</i>
<i> so much in five days.</i>

03:30.611 --> 03:32.711

03:32.713 --> 03:34.112
Clothes are made.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.814

to do now is get food.
-[jermaine] exactly.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.349
-That's the last thing.

[narrator]

03:40.287 --> 03:43.355

03:43.424 --> 03:45.824
[narrator] <i> ...Jermaine and w</i>

[wes vomiting]

03:57.471 --> 03:59.805
[narrator] sarah stepped up
by sourcing

03:59.807 --> 04:02.107
<i> Clean water from</i>
<i> a nearby creek.</i>

04:02.109 --> 04:03.909
-[jermaine]

-[sarah b] <i> oh, way better.</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:05.244
[sarah] notably better.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.648
[jermaine] god, we need
some food.

04:09.716 --> 04:13.852
You know, we get
one good wind,
that'll carry us through.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.221
-[jermaine] mmm-hmm.
-We'll be miserable,
but one good solid wind

04:16.223 --> 04:18.824
Will carry us through.
But we need to have one.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.726
[jermaine] <i> it's a very</i>

04:20.728 --> 04:22.227

Can't feel my feet,
my legs are cold,

04:25.132 --> 04:27.499
My arms are cold. My...

04:27.501 --> 04:29.501
Rabbit. Rabbit.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.742
Oh, oh. Grab the... Oh.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.811
Oh, damn.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.614
Okay. We gotta get busy.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.949
If he's gonna run that trail,

04:44.018 --> 04:45.550
Maybe we can set a snare.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.419
Hey, a bunny just passed.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.389
-[sarah] are you [bleep] me?
-[jermaine] no, so it
looks like, let's get on it.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.556
[sarah] <i> okay.</i>

04:55.629 --> 04:57.229
[narrator] <i> nine miles</i>
<i> to the northwest...</i>

04:57.931 --> 04:59.498
[waz a] it sounds cold
up there.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.034
[jake] let's get the fire
going and warm up a little.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.404
<i> Well, we just basically thro</i>
<i> a</i>  [bleep] <i> load of stuff on</i>

05:05.406 --> 05:08.407
[narrator] <i> ...Jake and waz</i>
<i> built a dam</i>
<i> in a shallow stream...</i>

05:08.409 --> 05:10.642
[jake] <i> yes, did it!</i>

05:10.711 --> 05:12.511
[narrator] <i> ...To improve the</i>
<i> chances of catching trout.</i>

05:12.513 --> 05:14.245
<i> See it?</i>

05:14.247 --> 05:17.616
[narrator] <i> but their effort</i>
<i> have failed to result</i>
<i> in any food wins.</i>

05:17.618 --> 05:19.418
[sarah] your toe is bleeding.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.254
[jake] this morning, the one's
pussing a little bit more than

05:22.323 --> 05:23.422
It has been, but...

05:24.525 --> 05:26.458
...I think, I mean I'm not
a toe scientist,

05:26.560 --> 05:29.661
But I've heard pussing
is the toe healing.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.963
-So, that's encouraging.
-[sarah] pus?

05:31.965 --> 05:34.132
[sarah] that's a sign
of infection, jake.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.701
[jake] my dad is actually
a toe scientist,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.703
I grew up in a toe
scientist family.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.238
So I know a thing or two
about toes.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.042
And it's that my pus-y toe
is healing.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.112
<i> I'm still dealing with some</i>
<i> pretty busted feet,</i>

05:47.114 --> 05:49.715
<i> But I feel like we're so clo</i>
<i> to having</i>

05:49.717 --> 05:52.050
<i> All the puzzle</i>
<i> pieces necessary</i>

05:52.119 --> 05:54.653
<i> To really just excel out her</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:55.954
We're just missing food,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.156
Which happens to be a big
part of surviving.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.126
[waz] we saw a couple
of trout...

06:01.128 --> 06:03.395
...Swimming out underneath
that ledge over there.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.897
It looks like the dam's
not deep enough yet.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.501
The flow of the water is still
sort of moving through fast.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.804
So we can put more sticks
and rocks there and slow
this water down even more.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.308
There's a ton of rocks
in this water right here.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.710
This is all the material that
we need to dam this.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.912
[jake] I'll jump in there
for a few minutes and throw

06:20.914 --> 06:22.547
20, 30 rocks with you.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.750
[waz] yeah, I think it's our
best bet to get food.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.852
[narrator] <i> fortifying the da</i>
<i> with rocks</i>

<i> Helping to concentrate</i>
<i> the fish.</i>

06:31.959 --> 06:34.559
<i> But spending more than a fe</i>
<i> moments in the frigid water</i>

06:34.661 --> 06:36.595
<i> Is extremely dangerous.</i>

06:36.597 --> 06:38.764
[waz] <i> today is a warmer</i>
<i> than usual day.</i>

06:38.832 --> 06:42.100
<i> But when you're standing</i>
<i> knee-deep in water this cold</i>

06:42.102 --> 06:44.970
It's still sucking
the body heat out of you
pretty quick, so.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.506
<i> We've got a nice big campfir</i>
<i> right by the water,</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.508
<i> So as soon as we're ready</i>
<i> to jump out, we can go</i>
<i> stand by that,</i>

06:49.510 --> 06:51.209
<i> Warm ourselves back up</i>
<i> straight away.</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:52.811
All right, let's go,
'cause this is going quick.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.012
Let's do this.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.680
[jake] swimming party started.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.049
[waz] we don't wanna push
this too hard, let's see what
we can get out of it.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.018
[jake] yeah, I think we have
to move quick.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.755

07:09.930 --> 07:12.531

for long,

07:58.111 --> 07:59.744
I lost dexterity
in my fingers.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.447
[jake] yeah, my feet
are pretty purple
at the moment.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.316

I'm gonna stay out.

I'm not quite sure
if it's beaver.

The wind has got such
a hair trigger on it.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.245
I'm gonna make another
trigger for it.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.214
Rod did set me up.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.416
I mean, I learned from him
while he was here,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.051
So I picked up some
of his trigger stuff.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.557
Rod, you still
out here, brother.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.428

them on a line

09:26.033 --> 09:28.400

10:31.231 --> 10:33.498
[sighs] come on.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.401
I broke my blades off
while trying to get it
out of the tree.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.604
Down to, like, five arrows.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.814
-[ky] all right, you ready?
-[gabby] let's go.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.150
-[gabby] fish are waiting
for us.
-[ky] yeah.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.319
[gabby] <i> I think we were all</i>
<i> kind of feeling</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:55.820
The lack of food.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.123
[ky] well, I'm gonna go
this way.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.624
[gabby] <i> so the plan for toda</i>

10:59.626 --> 11:01.926
<i> Ky is going hunting</i>
<i> for a rabbit.</i>

11:01.928 --> 11:03.762
-[gabby] good luck, ky.
-[joe] be careful.

11:03.863 --> 11:04.829
[ky] you guys, too.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.297
<i> I'm taking the bow and arrow</i>

11:06.299 --> 11:07.899
My main goal is to fish.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.802
<i> Joe's coming along</i>
<i> for the ride and we're gonn</i>
<i> fish together.</i>

11:10.804 --> 11:13.004
Looks like they had a little
freeze overnight, joe.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.539
<i> We'll have to break it off.</i>

11:14.641 --> 11:16.608
First step here is to start
collecting rocks.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.977
<i> Joe's out of the shelter tod</i>
<i> and feeling good.</i>

11:18.979 --> 11:21.146
[joe] hey, brisk. [laughs]

11:21.214 --> 11:23.214
-[gabby] it's brisk,
but sunny.
-Got a worm.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.350
[gabby] got a worm? Excellent.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.418
[grunts]

11:27.521 --> 11:28.820
Wow, it really froze.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.522
We're gonna need
some big ones.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.724
[joe] <i> we start picking up</i>
<i> rocks and just</i>
<i> throwing them on in.</i>

11:33.460 --> 11:34.559
<i> Kinda caveman style.</i>

11:34.661 --> 11:36.528
It's not the most
scientific thing, but...

11:36.530 --> 11:37.495
There we go.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.930
<i> ...We're gonna open up</i>
<i> the holes.</i>

11:38.932 --> 11:40.198
-[gabby] all right,
here we go.
-Go ahead.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.100
[joe] let's use
a tree branch, maybe?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.303
All right. [sighs]

11:45.305 --> 11:48.339
-[joe] I got two worms.
-Perfect.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.312
[gabby] just the right spot.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.148
<i> The trout are attracted</i>
<i> to the light that's shining</i>
<i> through the water,</i>

11:57.250 --> 11:59.050
And because this area,
the water is gonna

11:59.119 --> 12:00.518
Warm up faster than the rest
of the water,

12:00.520 --> 12:03.121
They're gonna be attracted
to this little zone

12:03.123 --> 12:04.723
<i> And find our bait.</i>

12:12.099 --> 12:14.499
[whispering] going after
this rabbit.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.736
[in normal voice]
he ran through here
and up there.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.940
And what I'm using is called
a poacher's snare.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.376
The knot, so it'll slip down

12:25.378 --> 12:27.812
But it doesn't slip back up.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.547
I'm thinking like
a rabbit. [laughs]

12:29.649 --> 12:31.249
Basically, rabbits run...

12:33.019 --> 12:36.020
...Leave a trail,
and diverting his
trail slightly.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.823
So, that he must have
run here first,

12:38.825 --> 12:41.659
He misses this one,
there's a second one...

12:41.695 --> 12:45.096
...Will make it so that
there's only really
one way to go...

12:45.098 --> 12:46.798
...Which is through our snare.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.636
The problem is making
it look natural.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.838
<i> They see changes</i>
<i> in their environment.</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:56.241
<i> They're a flight animal</i>
<i> and everything's trying</i>
<i> to eat them.</i>

13:06.453 --> 13:08.052
[ky] some rabbit tracks there.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.360
[whispering] just ahead,
something moving.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.363
There's a rabbit.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.502
[in normal voice]
eyes are usually the one thing

13:24.504 --> 13:26.437
That gives an animal away.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.439
There's nothing like that

13:28.541 --> 13:30.441
That occurs in rocks and trees
and things.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.722
Whoo, I'm feeling the fatigue.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.828
Just that little bit
made me realize...

13:49.830 --> 13:52.530
...How little food we've had
in five days.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.601
[gabby] no bites yet,
no nibbles yet.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.804
Just trying to be patient
for them.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.942
I'll cast this sucker
one more time.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.519
Look, one got me. He got me.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.721
[joe] oh, oh, fish on!

14:18.225 --> 14:19.858
Son of a [bleep].

14:21.161 --> 14:22.227
Oh, gabby.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.134
-[gabby] he got me.
-[joe] oh, oh, fish on!

14:31.738 --> 14:33.104
[joe] son of a [bleep].

14:35.108 --> 14:36.107
Oh, gabby.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.909
[gabby] over here. Ready?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.044
[joe] here, here. Come on.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.512
[both grunting]

14:41.514 --> 14:42.914
[gabby] so damn close.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.049
-[joe] oh.
-God damn it.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.352
-[joe sighs] wow.
-[sighs]

14:47.420 --> 14:49.354
-[joe] you completely
caught me off guard.
-[bleep].

14:49.422 --> 14:53.024
I never would've imagined
gabby was gonna jump
in the water. Never.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.026
That was, like,
a gut reaction.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.128
[laughing] I didn't mean
to actually jump in there.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.030
But I didn't want him
to go away.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.032
[joe] <i> we have gotta get</i>
<i> back to our camp.</i>

15:01.134 --> 15:04.302
<i> Being wet or even just</i>
<i> a little bit damp</i>
<i> in these temperatures,</i>

15:04.304 --> 15:05.770
It's dangerous.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.505
Let's go back and get
you out of this stuff,
let's get warm.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.007
[gabby] I'm good, I promise.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.410
-[joe] just watch your feet.
-Yep. Yeah.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.112
[gabby] <i> how dope it would'v</i>
<i> been if I could've actually</i>

15:14.114 --> 15:15.413
<i> Pulled that</i>
<i> sucker out, though.</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:21.419
[jermaine] <i> this is a promisi</i>
<i> little pool.</i>

15:22.622 --> 15:23.955
<i> It looks so trout-y.</i>

15:25.025 --> 15:27.425
<i> We need a source of protein</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:29.394
Part of that is, obviously,
the rabbit traps.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.862
They're good, you know,
they're set.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.064
If the rabbit's gonna
go through, it's gonna
go through.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.800
Second phase of that
is to build a dam

15:35.802 --> 15:37.302
<i> In the creek,</i>

15:37.304 --> 15:40.405
<i> So that some shot can actual</i>
<i> find a home in it, hopefully</i>

15:55.121 --> 15:56.955
-[jermaine] see this pool?
-[wes] oh, I like it.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.824
[wes] <i> jermaine and I have</i>
<i> dammed up this little creek</i>
<i> behind us</i>

15:59.826 --> 16:03.628
And creating a nice,
deep pool,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.697
<i> Where hopefully we can</i>
<i> catch some crawfish.</i>

16:05.699 --> 16:08.933
<i> At the same time,</i>
<i> sarah's working on</i>
<i> a crawfish basket.</i>

16:08.935 --> 16:11.302
[jermaine] oh, look at all
the rocks over there.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.937
Just gotta find the quickest
way over there.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.106
[wes] today's a beautiful day.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.409
-[jermaine yelps]
-feels good to actually
be doing something.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.780
-[jermaine grunts]
-don't do it, don't do it.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.116
-[jermaine]
okay, you ready? Set...
-Hold on.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.318
-Hold on, hold on,
I'm not ready. Hold on.
-Two... One.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.120
-[both counting] two, three...
-[jermaine grunts]

16:30.557 --> 16:33.157
[jermaine] yes, go, yes, go.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.931
[wes] where our bridge is,
might be a real nice place
to put the dam.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.499
-This is where we'll do it.
-Yeah.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.905
[jermaine] you got it.
Make the moves,
make the moves.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.941
Good job.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.380
-[jermaine] got it.
I'm through.
-There you go.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.949
[wes] you wanna throw
a dozen rocks in first?

16:57.951 --> 17:00.151
[jermaine] we can do it, sure.
There's a ton
of them here, so.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.719
[wes] <i> you know,</i>
<i> it's the longest we've been</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:03.221
<i> Out of the shelter</i>
<i> at one time.</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:07.258
We're doing good, baby,
looking good.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.362
[sarah] <i> currently working</i>
<i> on gathering materials</i>

17:11.431 --> 17:13.698
<i> To start making a, uh,</i>
<i> crawdad trap,</i>

17:13.700 --> 17:16.734
That, uh, hopefully we can set
in the pond area.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.303
And maybe catch us
some dinner.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.040
[jermaine] there we go.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.642
-[jermaine]
now we're building.
-That's good.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.344
[jermaine] we can keep
adding beaver material.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.013
-[wes] yeah.
-[jermaine] start beaver-ing
this [bleep] up.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.448
-[wes] I love
the spruce boughs.
-Yup.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.450
[wes] they're working good,
they're plugging
all the holes.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.318
We're looking good
on depth, man.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.953
Put the crawfish trap
somewhere in there?

17:35.955 --> 17:38.923
-[jermaine] slow water?
-Yeah.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.626
[sarah] <i> so the way that</i>
<i> a crawfish trap works is,</i>

17:41.628 --> 17:44.595
Is it's actually two cones,
one fit inside of the other.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.931
<i> As the crawfish go in</i>
<i> to seek out the bait,</i>

17:46.933 --> 17:49.033
<i> It cannot find its way</i>
<i> back out.</i>

17:49.035 --> 17:52.203
<i> However, if there is any kin</i>
<i> of a hole or a crevice,</i>

17:52.205 --> 17:54.806
<i> It'll just find its way out</i>
<i> and the trap is useless.</i>

17:54.941 --> 17:58.342
<i> So, doing a proper fish tra</i>
<i> takes a lot more time</i>

17:58.411 --> 17:59.811
<i> Than people tend to expect.</i>

18:01.514 --> 18:03.848
-[wes] how are you feeling
about it?
-Honestly in my heart?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.217
-It's a lot of calories.
-Okay.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.954
[jermaine] <i> we spent a lot</i>
<i> of caloric energy building</i>
<i> the dam today.</i>

18:10.023 --> 18:11.722
I'm lightheaded, [bleep].

18:12.625 --> 18:14.558
-You all right?
-Yeah.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.195
[jermaine] <i> I don't know</i>
<i> if it was a wise thing to do</i>
<i> but it's the thing we did.</i>

18:17.197 --> 18:19.330
[wes] ready for some water?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.833
If we're gonna put our efforts
towards something,

18:21.935 --> 18:23.935
<i> Then it needs to pay off.</i>

18:29.342 --> 18:30.842
[jermaine] [bleep].

18:37.784 --> 18:40.952
[jeremy whispering]
there's the game trail
that crosses through here.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.855
[in normal voice]
I just wanna come out here
and do some exploring.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.124
Maybe come across something
I can take with a bow

18:46.126 --> 18:47.858
And get us something to eat.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.828
<i> I wanna keep pushing myself</i>
<i> each day and getting</i>
<i> out there hunting.</i>

18:50.830 --> 18:53.231
Especially when you got
beautiful daylight today.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.300
See, you can see they
all coming out here.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.402
That's a lot of scat.

18:58.404 --> 19:01.439
Let's see if they're gonna
be moose or elk.

19:01.541 --> 19:05.443
A lot of times,
a lot of different animals
follow the same game trail.

19:16.456 --> 19:20.224
See that big old moose track?
Boy, those things are big.

19:20.226 --> 19:24.328
<i> Knowing that we do have</i>
<i> moose out here,</i>
<i> it puts you in your place.</i>

19:24.330 --> 19:26.964
[narrator] <i> moose can grow</i>
<i> up to 1,500 pounds</i>

19:27.033 --> 19:29.133
<i> And run up to 35 miles</i>
<i> per hour.</i>

19:31.304 --> 19:33.037
[jeremy] <i> I don't think that</i>
<i> my arrow tips</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:35.940
<i> Are large enough to take dow</i>
<i> an animal of this size.</i>

19:43.116 --> 19:44.649
Damn, there's a moose
right there.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.452
She's staring at me right now.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.428
[whispering] it's insane.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.632
[in normal voice]
absolutely beautiful.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.137
I'm about ready to get back.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.654
[jermaine] <i> today, wes and I</i>
<i> built that dam</i>

20:23.756 --> 20:26.524
In, like, an hour.
We built a dam,
dammed the whole water up.

20:26.526 --> 20:30.061
<i> The second phase of that</i>
<i> is to have the crawfish trap</i>

20:30.162 --> 20:32.063
<i> We can knock the fish trap</i>
<i> out in a day.</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:33.164
And we have to.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.699
Let me check these snares
real fast.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.200
<i> We're hoping that tonight..</i>

20:36.202 --> 20:38.035
<i> I feel like tonight</i>
<i> will be rabbit night.</i>

20:38.037 --> 20:39.169
[sarah] I'll come with.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.105
[jermaine] <i> this has been</i>
<i> the warmest day.</i>

20:41.107 --> 20:43.608
<i> Usually with warmth,</i>
<i> there's animal movement.</i>

20:43.610 --> 20:45.209
-[jermaine] [bleep].
-[sarah] what happened there?

20:45.211 --> 20:48.112
It was disturbed.
The noose is smaller.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.615
The bridge is disturbed,
everything's disturbed here.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.683
-[jermaine] looks like
a miss to me.
-Yup.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.953
[jermaine] [bleep].
[sighs] that's frustrating.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.625
-[sarah] can I make
a suggestion?
-Of course.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.960
These guys need
more clearance than that.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.029
I mean, you're talking about
a jackrabbit.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.032
They're not gonna go through
a space that is too small.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.601
This is something that I do
on a daily basis back home.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.437
'cause we have
a huge rabbit problem
in my neck of the woods.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.006
[jermaine] the difference
is I saw the rabbit,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.742
So I know exactly
how big it is.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.511
[sarah] <i> I have years</i>
<i> of rabbit trapping experienc</i>

21:20.513 --> 21:24.015
<i> It's actually something tha</i>
<i> I specialize in, so...</i>

21:24.017 --> 21:27.618
...I mean, I really wish that
jermaine were more open
to criticism.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.787
Oh, you're gonna have
to make those bigger, dude.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.355
I'm telling you.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.758
[jermaine] kinda wanna get
the crawfish thing,
I just wanna get it done.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.527
[sarah] okay. If you want me
to continue working on
my fish trap,

21:36.529 --> 21:38.829
-I can work on my fish trap.
-For real, do it,
gotta get it done.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.234
[jermaine] <i> everybody wants</i>
<i> to have an input</i>

21:43.303 --> 21:45.503
<i> And that's cool.</i>
<i> That's totally rad.</i>

21:45.505 --> 21:48.306
<i> But instead of standing</i>
<i> and watching,</i>

21:48.308 --> 21:49.940
Going, "I do have a skillset."

21:49.942 --> 21:51.742
Like, "I do."

21:51.844 --> 21:53.411
<i> I know you do.</i>  [chuckl]

21:53.413 --> 21:55.513
<i> Right now,</i>
<i> our skill sets combine.</i>

21:55.515 --> 21:57.715
Need to get things
done faster.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.618
[sarah] jermaine's got a stick
up his ass about something.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.391
Jermaine's got a stick
up his ass about something.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.827
[wes] <i> sarah and jermaine</i>
<i> are not getting along.</i>

22:09.829 --> 22:12.363
Seems like it's a time bomb
waiting to happen.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.834
[sarah] everybody's cranky,
you know?
That's just how it goes.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.838
[wes] <i> we're not having any</i>
<i> wins in the food department</i>
<i> that's so frustrating.</i>

22:20.940 --> 22:23.574
<i> Crossing my fingers that</i>
<i> jermaine gets a rabbit.</i>

22:23.576 --> 22:26.544
[jermaine] okay, so,
I'm making sure

22:26.645 --> 22:28.012
These traps are solid.

22:29.415 --> 22:33.250
<i> This evening, hopefully</i>
<i> the little rabbits are movin</i>

22:33.352 --> 22:35.820
<i> And they wanna get caught</i>
<i> and choke to death.</i>

22:55.408 --> 22:57.808
[waz] so, looks like
the amount of rocks we moved

22:57.810 --> 22:59.110
When jake and I
got in the water,

22:59.112 --> 23:01.712
It's noticeably raising
the water level here.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.115
And the fish can just
cruise around and wait
for something to eat,

23:04.117 --> 23:07.151
So we're gonna set up
a couple of lines under there
and see if we can't get lucky.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.954
<i> I'm gonna see if I can't fin</i>
<i> any bait.</i>

23:10.823 --> 23:12.123
[jake] <i> coming up here, just.</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:15.059
Knotting up some hooks.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.428
So we're kinda ready to go.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.632
[waz] I just turned
this animal scat over.

23:21.701 --> 23:25.002
Sometimes you gotta dig
through [bleep] to find
the good stuff.

23:25.004 --> 23:29.707
I got a couple
of live ones there,
they're all really small.

23:29.709 --> 23:33.344
But put a couple of those
on a hook, and then they'll
swallow it up.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.646
<i> I'm gonna get them back</i>
<i> to jake and he can throw</i>
<i> his lines in the water.</i>

23:38.751 --> 23:40.918
[sara] <i> I'm gonna go try</i>
<i> to find some prickly pear.</i>

23:41.721 --> 23:44.321
<i> Any amount of food,</i>

23:44.323 --> 23:48.159
<i> Whether it be a little berry</i>
<i> rose hips,</i>
<i> or the prickly pear,</i>

23:48.227 --> 23:49.826
It just boosts our morale.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.730
It's something on our stomach,
'cause we haven't had anything
in six days.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.064
Is there some up this way?

23:55.601 --> 23:58.736
See, that prickly pear
is done for.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.807
[jake] I'm gonna do
this ledge.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.976
<i> Not really the most ideal</i>
<i> fishing circumstances</i>

24:05.978 --> 24:09.046
As far as I'm concerned,
but we're making the most
with what we've got.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.015
[waz] that's a very big hook
for tiny little bait,

24:11.017 --> 24:12.616
But it's all we got right now.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.919
We got four lines here.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.054
We'll let a couple float down

24:17.156 --> 24:19.423
Under the back side
of the dam,
under that shelf there.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.927
<i> I think we should put two</i>
<i> upstream from the dam.</i>

24:22.929 --> 24:25.529
One can just be left
in the pool here
in the middle.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.498
And we sort of just,
trial and error, you know?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.201
[jake] yeah, we'll have to see
what they're attracted to.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.403
[sara] <i> I'm hoping the guys</i>
<i> get a trout,</i>

24:32.405 --> 24:36.407
And then prickly pear
is just, like,
a little appetizer.

24:36.409 --> 24:37.408
Oh, there's some right here.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.278
There's one.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.615
[narrator] <i> a small</i>
<i> prickly pear provides</i>
<i> about 40 calories.</i>

24:44.617 --> 24:45.816
[sara] got you.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.219
<i> It will at least put somethi</i>
<i> in our stomachs.</i>

24:48.221 --> 24:51.355
<i> I mean, it's nothing</i>
<i> substantial,</i>

24:51.457 --> 24:54.258
<i> But, I mean, I'm super</i>
<i> excited about it.</i>

24:54.327 --> 24:57.061
<i> It's better than</i>
<i> what we've gotten,</i>
<i> which is nothing.</i>

24:59.031 --> 25:00.331
[waz speaking]

25:00.333 --> 25:01.599
<i> That was the one</i>
<i> with the live bait,</i>

25:01.601 --> 25:02.833
<i> So I'm pretty disappointed</i>
<i> about that.</i>

25:02.935 --> 25:05.202
I thought that had
a bit more of a chance.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.137
[jake] <i> right now, we're kind</i>
<i> struggling with the fishing</i>

25:07.239 --> 25:09.240
<i> 'cause we don't have</i>
<i> the right bait.</i>

25:09.341 --> 25:11.475
-Good job, look at that.
-[sara] yum.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.144
[jake] <i> fortunately,</i>
<i> sara brought back</i>
<i> some prickly pear,</i>

25:14.213 --> 25:17.548
Which looks dangerous
and delicious.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.450
I think we just
cut them in half,

25:20.219 --> 25:21.819
Scrape out the inside,

25:21.821 --> 25:23.521
And call it a day.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.256
[jake] usually when
they're bigger,
it's so much easier

25:25.357 --> 25:26.824
-Just to kinda cut them
into cubes.
-[sara] yeah, I couldn't

25:26.826 --> 25:27.858
Find any huge ones.
It's impossible.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.060
[jake] no,
it's not impossible.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.630
-[sara] you're right.
-[jake] positive thoughts.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.498
<i> Sara gets in her head</i>
<i> and freaks out</i>

25:34.500 --> 25:35.533
<i> And can be really negative,</i>

25:35.634 --> 25:37.501
<i> But sara's been on it,</i>

25:37.503 --> 25:39.403
And she's got
all the skills you need

25:39.405 --> 25:40.838
To really crush it out here.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.106
Just give it a whirl.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.510
[sara] what's it taste like?

25:46.512 --> 25:48.746
-Um, glue.
-[sara laughs]

25:52.585 --> 25:54.518
[sara] <i> it tastes like</i>
<i> an unflavored kiwi.</i>

25:55.421 --> 25:56.954
-Hey, waz?
-[waz] yeah?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.222
[sara] can you come here
for a second?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.256
[waz] yes, ma'am.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.258
[jake] we got a little
snack for you.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.360
[sara] tell us what you think
it tastes like.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.795
-I think it's cucumber.
-[jake] yeah.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.730
Less water,
dehydrated cucumber,
there you go.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.631
Yeah.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.199
[waz] you got a bunch, sara.
Good job.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.634
[jake] I mean,
I think it's great,

26:10.636 --> 26:13.103
You know, to be able
to find anything
in this kind of environment.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.205
-Any food is good food. So...
-[sara] yeah.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.141
This will definitely help us.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.509
[jake] <i> I actually</i>
<i> enjoyed that.</i>

26:18.511 --> 26:19.944
-[sara] <i> did you? Good.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

26:19.946 --> 26:21.311
[sara] <i> that makes me happy.</i>

26:31.824 --> 26:34.224
-[ky] it's just beautiful
over here.
-[gabby] isn't it nice?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.660
-It's a nice spot
for a picnic.
-[laughing]

26:36.762 --> 26:37.828
[gabby] all we need's
the lunch.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.430
[laughing] all we need
is the lunch.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.633
Just gonna say a little
fisherman's prayer here
for a minute.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.135
[joe] <i> fishing</i>
<i> is an absolute priority toda</i>

26:45.204 --> 26:46.737
<i> We were just so close</i>
<i> last time.</i>

26:46.806 --> 26:49.006
<i> Everyone's staying</i>
<i> so optimistic.</i>

26:49.008 --> 26:50.007
<i> Something's gonna</i>
<i> happen today.</i>

26:50.710 --> 26:52.075
[ky] they're looking.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.844
[gabby] I hope
he's waking up and looking
at my freaking worm.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.313
We're in
the right neighborhood.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.015
[bleep] [gasps]

26:58.017 --> 26:59.216
We've got something
on this one.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.417
-[gabby] yeah?
-[ky] yeah, yeah.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.719
100%, got a nibble.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.354
[gabby] yeah, you got him, ky.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.289
[ky gasping] yes!

27:05.291 --> 27:06.724
-[gabby] get him, ky.
Get him, ky.
-[ky exclaims]

27:06.726 --> 27:08.092
Get him, ky.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.460
-[ky] whoo!
-[gabby] look at that
big mother trucker.

27:09.528 --> 27:10.728
-[ky] oh, it's on.
-[gabby] yeah, girl, get it!

27:10.730 --> 27:12.429
-Is he gone?
-[ky] he's off!

27:12.431 --> 27:14.198
-[exclaims]
-[ky] [bleep]

27:14.200 --> 27:15.599
[gabby] he took my hook.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.601
He ripped it right off.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.337
I'm gonna
tie my line different

27:21.240 --> 27:22.439
I just hope
it's strong enough.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.318
-Guys, I think we got
something here.
-[ky] what?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.823
[gabby] <i> I just felt him</i>
<i> tugging, hold on.</i>

27:41.227 --> 27:43.060
He's coming, see him?

27:43.128 --> 27:44.561
-[gasping]
-[gabby] coming
to the surface?

27:44.630 --> 27:45.963
-He's fighting.
-Oh, my gosh.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.265
Keep it. Keep it.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.700
[gasps]

27:52.638 --> 27:53.671
[gabby] see him?

27:53.739 --> 27:55.606
-[gasping]
-[gabby] coming
to the surface?

27:55.608 --> 27:58.008
<i> -He's fighting.</i>
-[ky] <i> oh, my gosh.</i>  [gasps]

27:58.010 --> 27:59.643
Keep it. Keep it.

27:59.679 --> 28:00.511
Don't lose it.

28:01.614 --> 28:04.515
Yes! [exclaims]

28:04.517 --> 28:06.650
Look at that!

28:06.752 --> 28:08.419
Don't loose that sucker!

28:08.421 --> 28:10.020
-What can I do?
-He's really hooked in there.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.221
-[ky] all right.
-You got him?

28:11.223 --> 28:12.523
[ky] I do.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.757
Look at this!

28:13.826 --> 28:15.159
Did you see that?

28:15.260 --> 28:16.760
Joe, stoke up that fire.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.429
We are eating
this sucker here.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.098
-Are you crying again?
-[gabby laughs]

28:21.100 --> 28:24.702
-[ky laughs]
-[joe] stop!

28:24.704 --> 28:27.104
[gabby] the girls are like,
[in a manly voice]
"stop crying."

28:27.106 --> 28:29.139
[joe] yeah, I'm just
a little emotional. [chuckles]

28:29.208 --> 28:30.908
[ky] here's the girl
of the hour!

28:30.910 --> 28:34.545
Everybody say, "gabby, whoo!"

28:34.646 --> 28:36.914
[gabby] <i> I've never caught</i>
<i> such an important fish</i>
<i> in my entire life.</i>

28:36.916 --> 28:39.049
Quick and easy,
thank you, buddy.

28:39.051 --> 28:43.120
<i> We needed protein,</i>
<i> and that fish means the worl</i>
<i> to all three of us.</i>

28:43.122 --> 28:45.022
Hopefully, it will give us
the energy we need

28:45.024 --> 28:47.324
To push through
the second half
of this challenge.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.659
We've been working
at these suckers

28:48.727 --> 28:50.527
For a couple days now.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.962
It's a good thing
that we're gutting it here

28:52.031 --> 28:54.398
Because we do have
our mountain lion.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.599
Out and around the shelter.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.103
[joe] one long stick
and some smaller ones

28:59.105 --> 29:02.206
I can actually spread it open
and keep it butterflied open.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.407
[gabby] thanks
for cooking, joe.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.142
[joe] I don't mind, really.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.311
[joe] <i> to be able</i>
<i> to bring my talents out her</i>

29:07.313 --> 29:09.179
<i> And prepare them a nice meal</i>

29:09.181 --> 29:10.414
That's just my way
of showing I care.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.649
[ky] oh, my god!

29:12.718 --> 29:14.318
-[joe] look at that.
-[ky] look at the fat in that!

29:14.320 --> 29:16.720
[gabby] come on,
grab a piece. Here we go.

29:16.722 --> 29:19.123
-[ky] cheers!
-Cheers, you guys.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.959
These people really
are worth every last bit
of effort I have.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.027
[gabby] mmm.
Cooked to perfection, joe.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.195
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.698
[ky] my brain just can't quite
believe the signals

29:27.700 --> 29:30.300
That my mouth
is sending it right now.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.503
When you haven't eaten
for seven days,

29:32.505 --> 29:34.538
And you've been working
as hard as we have been,

29:35.608 --> 29:38.008
That bite of meat,
it tastes like life.

29:38.010 --> 29:42.179
I can feel the energy,
like, just resurging
into my body.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.648
This feels like
it resets everything
back to day one.

29:44.717 --> 29:45.915
[gabby] yeah, right?

29:45.917 --> 29:48.152
[ky] this little carnivore's
pretty happy right now.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.219
[joe laughs]

29:50.956 --> 29:52.422
Just a couple of bones left.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.225
-The entrails, we're gonna
be using for bait.
-[gabby] mmm-hmm.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.861
[ky] we just can't afford
to waste anything out here.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.563
This has been a hard fought

30:00.332 --> 30:01.832
Food battle for us here.

30:02.835 --> 30:03.934
[gabby] definitely didn't
come easy.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.236
[ky] <i> what a day, guys.</i>

30:14.680 --> 30:16.513
It is nice and deep in there.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.215
<i> We're ready, we need to fish</i>

30:18.217 --> 30:21.418
<i> The crawfish thing,</i>
<i> let's get that knocked out.</i>

30:21.420 --> 30:23.120
[sarah] it's just
a tedious process

30:24.056 --> 30:25.288
In order to make it right.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.364
[jermaine] you give it to me,
I'll get it woven in...

30:34.433 --> 30:35.933
-[sarah] oh, yeah.
-[wes] we just gotta
get it done.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.534
So we can get it the [bleep]
in there, you know?

30:40.406 --> 30:41.939
Let's just get it in.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.445
[sarah] make sure
that's sinched up
good and tight.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.017
You want me
to take over, let me know.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.419
[jermaine] this is your thing.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.221
The only reason I took over

30:57.223 --> 30:58.588
Was to expedite it.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.724
[sarah] my issue
is there's no point
in making a fish trap

31:00.726 --> 31:02.125
Unless you're doing it right.

31:02.127 --> 31:04.561
If there is any kind of gap
in this situation.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.330
[jermaine] I dig it
as far as design,

31:06.332 --> 31:08.298
But we've gotta get it
done faster.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.334
[sarah] and I'm taking
about getting it right,

31:10.402 --> 31:11.935
And we can get it done today

31:12.805 --> 31:13.704
If you let me work on it.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.706
[jermaine] okay. Here you go.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.040
-[sarah] all right.
-[jermaine] be done today.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.642
-Okie-doke.
-[sarah] I hate
to say it, dude,

31:18.711 --> 31:21.111
But this is a situation
of survival over ego.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.547
I agree, precisely.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.350
And we've gotta get
this done faster.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.051
-[sarah] we can
get it done faster...
-[jermaine] I agree with you.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.821
[sarah] ...If you help me
with gathering
materials, okay?

31:34.526 --> 31:38.028
<i> -There's no point in making</i>
<i> a trap that does not work.</i>
-[sighs]

31:38.030 --> 31:40.664
Putting all that energy
into something like this

31:40.699 --> 31:42.532
That's just going to
fail automatically

31:42.601 --> 31:44.401
Because it was not
done correctly

31:44.403 --> 31:47.938
<i> Is a waste of calories,</i>
<i> a waste of resources,</i>
<i> and a waste of time.</i>

31:48.707 --> 31:49.806
[wes] tell you what,

31:49.808 --> 31:51.808
God damn fish basket
better be done by tomorrow.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.826
There's four trout.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.529
Two more trout. That's about
six trout right here.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.532
I gotta tell trish
about this spot.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.603
[trish] <i> this is probably</i>
<i> the worst shelter</i>
<i> I've ever made.</i>

<i> And still have to get out</i>

32:38.924 --> 32:40.424
<i> And push to cut trees</i>

32:40.426 --> 32:42.626
<i> And push to fish</i>
<i> and push to hunt.</i>

32:43.929 --> 32:46.363

32:47.166 --> 32:48.732
[jeremy speaking]

32:48.801 --> 32:51.101
[trish] <i> we just really</i>

32:54.006 --> 32:55.806
<i> A little bit up the creek.</i>

32:55.808 --> 32:57.607
That means we have to
make a decision.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.210
Are we gonna
finish the shelter

33:00.212 --> 33:02.779
And make it 100% perfect,

33:02.781 --> 33:04.147

33:04.249 --> 33:05.949

33:10.622 --> 33:11.722
[jeremy] that's where
they're at.

33:11.724 --> 33:12.723
They're up
underneath that stuff.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.925
Fish...

33:17.162 --> 33:19.629
[trish] guess I'm gonna
post up here
for a few minutes, and...

33:21.300 --> 33:22.866
...See if anything happens.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.479
[waz] there's a chance
we got a pretty solid storm
coming in, sara.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.913
-[sara] yeah.
-[waz] it looks like rain.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.582
[sara] I'm gonna be
working on our shelter.

<i> we need more firewood.</i>

33:59.505 --> 34:02.205

[trish] <i> I don't see</i>

and mixed rain.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.771
It's terrible.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.341
[jermaine] <i> montana</i>
<i> decided to spit a bunch</i>
<i> of ice pellets on us.</i>

40:46.745 --> 40:47.911
[jeremy] <i> it started raining</i>

40:47.913 --> 40:49.579
[trish sighs]

40:49.581 --> 40:53.283
We're trying our best
just trying to stay warm
and dry underneath this thing.

40:53.285 --> 40:57.654
<i> If it become a downpour</i>
and then just soak everything,

40:57.722 --> 41:00.623
<i> Put the fire out,</i>
<i> soak all the pelts,</i>

41:00.625 --> 41:02.725
<i> I don't know how</i>
<i> I could recover from it.</i>

41:02.727 --> 41:06.396
It's all hands
on deck right now,
it's freezing rain,

41:06.398 --> 41:08.765
And our shelter's
not exactly water tight.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.633
[jermaine] <i> wes and I</i>
<i> are scrambling</i>

41:10.635 --> 41:12.502
<i> To make sure</i>
<i> there's fire in here.</i>

41:12.504 --> 41:15.238
<i> Gotta do something to preven</i>
<i> some of this ice rain</i>

41:15.307 --> 41:16.406
<i> From falling inside of here</i>

41:16.408 --> 41:18.441
Oh, it's gonna be
cold and long.

41:20.212 --> 41:21.311
<i> We're gonna be hunkering dow</i>

41:22.013 --> 41:23.746
<i> And just trying to stay aliv</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:24.814
Oh, my god.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.416
It actually is a little scary.
