WEBVTT

00:13.240 --> 00:14.200
It has been over
24 hours since the

00:14.320 --> 00:16.440
Disease Control and
the National Guard

00:16.560 --> 00:21.680
the Angels Memorial Hospital
in downtown quarantined...

00:21.880 --> 00:24.720
This could be the worst
virus outbreak in years.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.560
Comparisons are made with

00:27.680 --> 00:30.720
SARS 2003 or swine flu in 2009.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.240
According to sources, 6
people died, many are sick.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.320
The epidemic protection
team is constantly

00:39.440 --> 00:41.080
on duty to find out
how the virus got to L.A.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.920
prevent its spread
and find a remedy.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.200
If you think you are infected,

00:44.320 --> 00:45.640
call the number on the screen.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.880
Symptoms include
fever, vomiting, bruises,

00:49.040 --> 00:50.360
Bleeding and disorientation.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.160
EMERGENCY

01:05.800 --> 01:07.280
We can't leave them like that.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.640
It is not medical waste.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.520
It is not.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.160
You...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.560
She wanted me to
go to yoga with her.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.520
You and yoga?

01:31.560 --> 01:32.600
Yes.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.640
She said that would relax him.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.240
It doesn't seem
to have helped her.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.080
Definitely not.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.080
I miss you

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
Me too.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.160
Me too.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.200
Do you feel good?

02:07.880 --> 02:08.919
Is it suddenly important to you?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.880
What does this mean?
Of course it is.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.920
Is that why you called the
youth welfare office about me?

02:16.440 --> 02:20.680
I called because you're
13 and you need a home.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.680
Now I don't need one
anymore, as it looks.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.720
All who get it die.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.440
I will find out.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.240
If anyone believed

02:32.040 --> 02:33.720
if it weren't for men
with guns everywhere.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.440
Listen to me.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.480
Sometimes...

02:39.960 --> 02:41.440
Sometimes things happen to us.

02:41.920 --> 02:46.240
They can make us small,
but sometimes also bigger.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.200
I want you to choose the latter.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.840
Whatever that means.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.560
Ariel, Ariel, come back please.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.640
Ariel.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.240
What have I missed?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
Reddick is holding a
meeting where we're unloaded.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.520
It is now called against us.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.360
And we won't lose
either of us anymore.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.000
No, we won't.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.400
What do we know?

03:18.600 --> 03:21.560
Yolanda was infected
and died 48 hours later.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.760
Of the 5 she had contact
with, 4 are now dead.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.080
Heather too.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.600
Yolanda infected
Alicia Dias, the only one

03:34.760 --> 03:36.080
still alive among those
who were infected first.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.720
She was the one who
infected my waiting room.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.680
... so began the
second cycle of infection.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.320
-You stab like a beginner.
-Yes.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.680
The time now is 1:51 PM.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.960
The patients in the second cycle,

03:52.080 --> 03:56.040
Elliot, Mario, Malaya
and Ariel, among

03:56.160 --> 03:58.120
others, still have
about ten hours to live.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.280
And what do we not know?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.960
The patient's identity is zero.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.360
He could be the key.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.800
Where did Yolanda get sick?

04:04.360 --> 04:05.840
She has no registration address.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.280
She probably lived somewhere.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
Maybe Alicia knows.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.720
Doctors, come here quickly.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.200
Lorazepam is entered.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.120
Alicia!

04:18.279 --> 04:20.760
Alicia!  Can you hear me?
Alicia...

04:20.880 --> 04:22.480
-Is she conscious?
-Your blood pressure is collapsing.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.320
-Alicia?  Can you hear me?  Alicia?
-Malaya, vasopressors!

04:25.440 --> 04:26.680
Ask her where Yolanda lived.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.680
-Now?  How so?
-Because your life depends on it.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.600
Malaya, ask her!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.440
Alicia, where did your
friend Yolanda live?

04:36.600 --> 04:38.280
-With whom?
-Raul Gomez...

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
-Where?
-Arlington Heights.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.400
Arlington Heights.  Good.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.360
Look for a Raul Gomez
in Arlington Heights.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.760
-Check the address.
-At it.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.480
I come with.  No discussion.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.760
You need type 1 protective suits.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.720
Raul?

05:13.240 --> 05:14.440
Raul?  Are you there

05:32.080 --> 05:33.160
DISEASE PROTECTION

05:33.280 --> 05:34.440
This is one of our cars.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
Why is he here?

05:49.680 --> 05:51.320
The disease control has
strains of pathogens in

05:51.440 --> 05:53.320
the container when it
brings them to a laboratory.

05:55.880 --> 05:56.840
It's empty.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.720
It must have been
stolen in transit.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.800
And infected yourself
in the process.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.360
That's why Gareth is so
silent, they lost the virus.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.080
We have to find the container.
How does it look like?

06:05.440 --> 06:07.360
A small plexiglass
box with a security

06:07.480 --> 06:08.600
lock, about the
size of a shoebox.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.120
The light doesn't come on.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.240
Raul?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.000
Raul?

06:23.240 --> 06:24.400
Are you here?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.680
Something is not right.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.080
For example the
blood on the floor?

06:35.640 --> 06:36.840
Something is here.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.000
That's part of the container.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.400
That means we are at the
zero point of the virus outbreak.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.680
But where is the
rest of the container?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.520
The garbage truck.

07:10.120 --> 07:10.760
Here.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.920
According to the label, the
virus is in its third phase of testing.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.000
What does that mean?

07:17.240 --> 07:20.680
Part one is the virus,
part two is its antibodies

07:20.880 --> 07:22.920
-and part three is...
-... a vaccine.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.520
Wait a minute, are you
saying Reddick has the cure?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.400
What was that?

07:29.640 --> 07:30.640
Where does it come from?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.320
Raul?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.200
Raul?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.560
Are you here?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.120
Raul?

07:48.040 --> 07:49.440
-Leanne!
-Go away!

07:50.800 --> 07:51.760
Leanne!

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
How bad is it?

08:13.120 --> 08:14.240
You should see the other guy.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.960
Leanne, you may not be infected.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.200
Sure, a patient with
an aggressive infection

08:25.320 --> 08:26.960
drips his blood into
my open wound.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.080
I'm sure you're right.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.280
It should have hit me.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.120
Then I would worry and
you would end up in the tent.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.200
I do not worry.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.039
We will find a solution.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.799
Hey, get out of there, sir.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.840
Get off the curb.

08:40.679 --> 08:41.960
If it was believed that
we could find a solution,

08:42.080 --> 08:43.440
there wouldn't be men
with guns everywhere.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.840
I saw the virus stem container.
A vaccination is being developed.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.760
Potential vaccination.
We need blood tests for everyone.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.560
Those with symptoms go with us.
Put on a breathing apparatus.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
You lied to us.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.640
You knew the virus came from
epidemic control, you knew...

08:59.760 --> 09:02.120
We knew about the stolen
van and we had it under control.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.960
They ignored the quarantine
and a doctor was infected.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.760
Under control?  People are
dying and you have the antidote!

09:08.880 --> 09:10.400
It's preclinical!

09:10.640 --> 09:12.880
The animal experiments
gave different results...

09:13.000 --> 09:16.160
We both know how difficult it is
to test such a virus on animals...

09:16.280 --> 09:18.920
Millions get the flu.
And their pets?  None.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.000
The answer is no.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.880
I'm sorry Ethan.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.440
It's not over yet.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.600
What are you going to do?

09:27.720 --> 09:28.960
I'm doing a favor.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
What is your temperature

09:36.040 --> 09:38.320
It's high, but not bad.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.680
Do you already have a stomach ache?

09:39.800 --> 09:40.760
Are you quiet

09:41.240 --> 09:42.440
You are the patient now.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.760
We are all patients now.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.240
Oh my God.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
She is still a child.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.920
How are you?

10:19.240 --> 10:20.360
It's okay to be scared.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.440
I'm not afraid.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.600
For real?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.840
What's your secret
Because I'm scared to death.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.200
I've seen worse.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.520
The bubonic plague?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.360
The smallpox.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.400
I had the plague once, but
it was just old Tex-Mex food.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.360
Leanne?

10:50.480 --> 10:52.640
-Dr.  Rorish.
-Let me talk to her.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
I don't move.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.440
Neither do I.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.880
You don't have to, okay?

11:02.160 --> 11:03.360
Please everyone calm down.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.040
I'm fine.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.080
Is it true?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.080
I have no symptoms.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.000
I'm fine.  Until now.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.240
Mom, you look like a
pineapple in that thing.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.640
I?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.880
You look like...

11:29.040 --> 11:30.080
You look great.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.480
Jesse, make a joke.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.240
I can not.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.920
Leanne.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.280
Dr.  Rorish says you can have
fear and courage at the same time.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.720
Dr.  Rorish...

11:52.080 --> 11:54.040
Why is Leanne not wearing
any of these spacesuits?

11:58.240 --> 11:59.800
I felt a bit left out.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.120
How are everyone here?

12:05.720 --> 12:06.800
Ariel.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.960
You're sick too, right?

12:13.240 --> 12:15.680
Do not worry.
We'll get well again.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.920
I know when someone
is lying to me, you know

12:24.960 --> 12:26.240
I will never lie to you.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.320
You can count on that.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.720
I feel like I am making
a pact with the devil.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.800
You are actually making
a pact with an angel.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.720
What happened?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.440
A new heart has
been found for me.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.840
And it's in Los Angeles.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.920
What about the quarantine?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.880
It is flown here by air rescue.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.560
They drop it on
the roof and fly on.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.120
Thank goodness good news.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.120
Have you already learned
something about Jeremy?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.920
No I'm sorry.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.880
There was nothing new
from the quarantine tent yet.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.560
How did you get in here?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.200
-Reddick ordered...
-I called General Hutchens.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.280
The vaccine is on its way.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.040
Our people can get back in here.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.520
Dr.  Willis.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.160
And the best is coming now.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.040
Who do you think you are?

13:40.280 --> 13:42.320
"I'm just a girl
who stands in front

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
of a boy and asks
him to love him."

13:43.560 --> 13:44.520
What?

13:44.640 --> 13:45.600
Not a big movie fan?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.400
You have no idea.
This vaccine...

13:48.520 --> 13:49.480
... was never tested.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.840
She loses her air supply.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.080
Dr.  Pineda, the
ultrasound machine.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.200
The pulse is weak.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.280
No no.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.800
She drowns in her own saliva.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.000
Get the endoscope.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.160
- It's okay, Ariel.  I'm there.
-The intubation trolley!

14:00.280 --> 14:02.760
No, when we intubate her,
she always has to be ventilated.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.120
Your airways are not intact.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.200
Suck off.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.800
She can do it, Ethan.
She is a strong child.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.960
Good.  Wait with the
medication.  Suction.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.360
Ariel, look at me.
Keep looking at me

14:15.000 --> 14:16.240
OK?  Good.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.280
Please breathe through
your nose, just breathe.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.200
It's a little scary, but
just keep breathing.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.840
I'm with you.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.440
Keep breathing slowly.  All good.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.640
Almost finished.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.320
Breath slowly.  You can do it.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.560
Saturation and blood
pressure are stable.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.200
So what.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.320
That's it

14:43.040 --> 14:44.400
That was great.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.680
-Well done.
-Yes.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.040
Yes.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.360
Shall I say why I resisted?

14:57.520 --> 14:59.960
Because a little girl
is fighting for her life

15:00.080 --> 15:01.600
there, and you are watching
from your window seat.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.800
Willis, listen.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.800
Gretchen thinks
that the animal testing

15:04.920 --> 15:06.640
was compromised
for biological reasons,

15:06.760 --> 15:08.800
but there were deaths.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.600
In some cases, the
vaccine made it faster.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.280
If it can kill a pig, it
will kill people too.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.240
Do you understand what I say?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.720
I understand.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.240
It's too risky to test
the vaccine on a child.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.440
But you can test it on me.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.720
Breathing is difficult and
the lungs are full of fluids.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.880
His pulse is weak.
Come on, Bill.  Keep up.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.000
The helicopter is coming.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.080
I hope this is true.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
Take the patient
back to their room.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.480
This is my station.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.680
I prepare my patient for
the operation.  Are you going.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.000
The transport
helicopter won't come.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.040
He's not allowed to.
You know that.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.480
We are not prisoners.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.840
Dr.  Campbell, I
see you take this

16:02.960 --> 16:04.400
personally because
you lost your colleague,

16:04.560 --> 16:07.280
but this is a quarantine,
there is a reason that we...

16:08.440 --> 16:10.600
No pulse.  Start with
chest compressions.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.760
Get the ambulance, help me.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.640
Come on, Bill.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.120
Ready.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.320
Step away.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.040
No pulse.  Once again.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.320
Step away.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.080
No pulse.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.480
Come on, Bill.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.440
Come on, Bill.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.560
Shock again, Rollie.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.440
-He's dead...
-Shock him again.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.520
But we don't get an impulse
from a dead heart muscle.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.400
Come over.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.600
His heart is dead.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.560
Dr.  Campbell, I'm sorry.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.800
Gareth, the vaccine is here.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.880
Time of death...

17:00.400 --> 17:01.800
8:37 a.m.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.080
I am fine.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.560
Obviously.

17:46.920 --> 17:47.880
Would you mind...

17:48.520 --> 17:49.480
Yes.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.960
From all the doctors in Angels

17:56.360 --> 17:57.960
I want to be like you.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.040
Watching them is...

18:04.480 --> 18:08.080
a lesson in keeping
calm and not the opposite.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.520
Until now.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.680
No.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.800
They also taught me
that one can be human.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.160
I don't want you to have
the vaccination, Leanne.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.600
You heard her.
She is dangerous.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.080
You said Ariel doesn't
belong to anyone.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.720
We have that in common.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.040
Nobody's waiting for
me at home, Jesse.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.760
Do not say that.  That's not true.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.840
It is true.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.480
Maybe that's why I'm here.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.880
To test the antidote so
that others can survive.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.000
Others whose life
is just beginning.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.880
Do you think you
don't belong to any?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.160
How can you say that to me

19:15.720 --> 19:17.240
You are mine, Leanne.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.920
As I belong to you

19:20.320 --> 19:22.080
Tu eres mi familia.  Entiendes?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.640
Tu eres mi familia.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.600
Si.  Entiendo.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.760
Thank you.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.320
Leanne, are you ready?

19:32.960 --> 19:33.920
Yes.

19:34.120 --> 19:37.160
Jesse, I love you too.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.720
Come over.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.440
If there's a chance
to save a life, your life,

19:44.400 --> 19:45.480
then I have to try.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
It is there.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.720
I want updates on her scores
and blood tests every 15 minutes.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.120
Now that you've done it,
there are rules to be followed.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.720
Miss Chislett...

20:31.120 --> 20:33.320
Her father suffered
an aortic rupture.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
His heart stopped beating.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.960
-No... I don't understand.
-Anna.  Listen.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.240
We are sorry.
Your father is dead.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.160
No.  They told me he
was getting a new heart!

20:43.320 --> 20:44.440
She said there was a new heart.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.520
Yes there was a heart.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.240
But because of the quarantine, she
was not allowed to go to the hospital.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.320
I'm so sorry.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.160
No, I need Jeremy.
I want to see Jeremy.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.360
You're welcome...

20:54.480 --> 20:56.320
Miss Chislett, I'm
sorry, but Jeremy...

20:56.600 --> 20:59.240
-... is in the quarantine tent.
-I want to see Jeremy, please.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.920
-You can't go to him.
-I do not care.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.160
-I just want to see Jeremy.
-No...

21:03.320 --> 21:04.800
Please... listen.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.040
SILENCE PLEASE

21:06.480 --> 21:07.760
Anna, look at me.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.000
I know how alone
you feel now.  For real.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.680
But you are not alone.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.560
Trust me.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.480
You have to be strong
for Jeremy now, right?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.200
Hello?

21:33.240 --> 21:34.200
I am here, Elliot.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.960
Mom?

21:37.760 --> 21:38.800
Are you that?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.480
No, Elliot.  I am Malaya.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.920
I do not feel well.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.840
I will give you more fluids.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.680
Mom?  Are you that?

22:02.920 --> 22:03.880
Yes, honey.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.920
Here is mom.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.320
I'll bring this to the lab right away.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.720
I've lived in a cemetery
for the past four years.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.400
I don't want her to die in you.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.520
What do you mean by cemetery?

22:36.520 --> 22:40.680
I haven't been to my children's
rooms in all these years.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.040
They stopped in
time as they were.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.440
Ariel is sleeping on
a sofa in my house

22:48.840 --> 22:52.720
and not even 6 m further
there are two unused beds.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.960
What's wrong with me

22:56.080 --> 22:58.400
Am I so afraid of the memories?

23:01.200 --> 23:02.760
Maybe you are not
afraid of memories.

23:04.320 --> 23:09.440
But before...
replacing them with new ones.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.960
Because that could
be like betrayal.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.920
Leanne...

23:29.160 --> 23:31.840
I'm fine.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.040
I'm fine.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.520
-It has no effect.
-We need more time.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.320
The fever is at 39.4 degrees.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.240
It's higher than it
was 15 minutes ago.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.000
If she reacts to the substance,
then the time has come.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.400
I told you the
vaccine wasn't ready.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.560
But you had to
stir up false hopes.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.480
You should have known better.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.640
And now?

23:56.840 --> 23:59.160
Dr.  Reed will bring
blood samples from

23:59.280 --> 24:00.520
those exposed to the
virus to our Atlanta lab

24:00.800 --> 24:03.840
to develop new immunoglobulin
and better vaccine.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.280
I am so sorry.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.760
What are you saying?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.480
What about our people?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.440
We are currently in
control of the outbreak.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.240
The last outbreak cycle is in
the hot zone quarantine tent.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.280
Impossible to find a
remedy during the incubation.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.520
We will make it as
easy as possible for you.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.880
I'm so sorry.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.760
Did he just say...

24:37.880 --> 24:39.000
We can't save them.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.960
Gretchen.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.720
Don't go back.

24:49.840 --> 24:52.760
You're upset, I'm sorry.
We can not do anything.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.040
We can do something.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.360
We can test the
samples ourselves.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.760
They said the
original vaccine came

24:59.880 --> 25:02.080
from a person with
natural immunity.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.280
What if we find
someone in our ranks

25:05.400 --> 25:06.960
who is equally immune
to the pathogen?

25:07.480 --> 25:10.040
The chances are so slim.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.720
Almost nonexistent, yes.  But
better than that when you go.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.160
Where are your lab technicians?

25:18.280 --> 25:19.240
You see them in front of you.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.440
We're not giving up yet.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.720
There are hundreds of samples.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.200
Is this your entire team?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.360
Have you ever worked
during a code black?

25:26.440 --> 25:27.640
You don't need
more than this team.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
OK.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.040
Anna...

25:57.240 --> 25:58.640
There's someone here
who would love to see you.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.200
Anna, good to see you.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.000
Jeremy.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.160
Hey i'm fine

26:10.720 --> 26:12.080
Dad is...

26:15.280 --> 26:16.280
He didn't make it.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.160
I'm so sorry.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.760
I am so sorry.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.320
I wish I could be with you.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.040
You'll.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.800
You have to. I
mustn't lose you too.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.200
I'm here.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.360
I am here and I will be fine.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.640
And I watch you walk the
aisle in your beautiful dress.

26:37.960 --> 26:42.600
And I read out the oath
that I still have to write

26:43.760 --> 26:47.000
and we'll have
long, happy lives.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.480
OK?

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
I love you.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.200
-I need help over here!
-Jeremy!

26:57.240 --> 26:58.560
Jeremy what is it?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.320
Blood in the airways.
The pulse becomes weaker...

27:00.520 --> 27:01.480
Suck off, immediately, go!

27:01.600 --> 27:03.160
-Mario, what's wrong?
-Stay awake.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.600
Hold on, Jeremy.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.760
Mario, talk to me.

27:05.880 --> 27:06.840
... vacuum immediately!

27:06.960 --> 27:07.920
CALL ENDED

27:12.400 --> 27:13.360
What do you have here?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.560
Severe hyperkalemia, EKG
is variable.  He got medicine.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.120
He needs dialysis right away.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.000
There are no other devices.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.560
He has ventricular tachycardia.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.640
Peritoneum irrigation.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.920
We can use the abdominal
tissue to filter blood.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.080
The peritoneum irrigation kit.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.600
I'll get it myself.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.280
There.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.920
Here is the catheter.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.320
Fine, I'll make the cut.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.840
Continue.  Insert the catheter.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.040
Good.  I turn up now.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.560
It doesn't work.  No pulse.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.960
Begin the compressions
and give calcium once.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.080
-I have it.
-Good.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.760
-Elliot.
-No, Mario.  Stay here.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.360
Do not stop doing
chest compressions.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.080
Dr.  Pineda, keep breathing.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.280
People?

28:05.240 --> 28:06.200
Come on, Elliot.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.360
I need...

28:10.320 --> 28:11.520
Come on, Elliot.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.600
I don't see the vocal cords.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.360
I can help.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.720
OK.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.160
Go to the car and
get me a glow stylet.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.400
It's a long wire with
a light on the end.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.520
Looks like a book lamp.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.040
-The?
-I agree!

28:32.160 --> 28:33.120
Bring it here.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.120
Nice.  Unpack it.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.520
-I'm afraid.
-Have no fear.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.360
We can do it together.
Hold that.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.880
-Look at me.
-OK.

28:44.000 --> 28:44.960
Look me in the eye

28:45.720 --> 28:47.120
Have no fear.  We make it.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.280
We can do it together, yes?

28:51.280 --> 28:52.720
-OK.
-OK.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.480
You see the light at
the end of this, yeah?

28:55.600 --> 28:56.560
Yes.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.280
Follow the light when I...

28:59.400 --> 29:00.360
OK.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.520
Pulse check.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.360
No pulse.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.440
Another unit of epinephrine.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.840
I can not do this.
Can you take?

29:15.120 --> 29:16.080
OK.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.320
I see the light.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.920
OK.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.080
Now press carefully.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.280
No, very gently.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.960
-Every five to six seconds.
-Good.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.040
Push.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.920
Five...

29:32.440 --> 29:34.560
Hold on, stop.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.720
To press.

29:35.960 --> 29:39.640
Two three four...

29:39.880 --> 29:43.320
-Press, two...
-... three, four, five.

29:43.480 --> 29:47.720
Two three four five.

29:47.840 --> 29:53.120
-Press, two...
-... three, four, five.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.400
Breathing sounds on both sides.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.880
You managed.  You saved him.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.240
No.  You saved him.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.640
Check your pulse again?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.120
Check pulse.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.760
I feel a pulse.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.040
He becomes more stable.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.280
We don't even have
half the samples.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.160
It's been two hours.
I have to go.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.480
No, we need another hour.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.760
I am very sorry.
I have to go to the plane.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.680
Willis...

30:55.960 --> 30:56.960
I found something.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.520
Look at that.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.040
Look at the pillars.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.080
They fit.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.800
Is he right?  Is that a match?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.440
Definitely a match.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.760
Or?

31:13.160 --> 31:14.280
It looks like it to me.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.240
It's a match.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.880
It's a match!

31:26.640 --> 31:28.280
-Have you seen Anna?
- She was still here just now.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.000
I have to go there.
I have to see my fiancé.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.720
-I can't let you in.
-You're welcome.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.480
-Please go away.
-Please please.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.800
Step away, private.
That is an order.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.280
Get back, Colonel.
You are not a supervisor.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.360
Move.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.800
-Anna!
-Anna!

31:40.920 --> 31:41.880
I said stop!

31:42.000 --> 31:43.120
-No!  No!
-Do not shoot!

31:44.080 --> 31:45.600
-No!
-Anna.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.840
Stop.  Stop immediately.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.240
Back back.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.960
Oh my God.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.040
Was that a shot?

31:57.240 --> 31:58.480
Mario, what's wrong?

32:00.760 --> 32:01.800
I can not see anything.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.520
Dr.  Rorish.  Mario!

32:09.760 --> 32:10.720
Leanne!

32:18.040 --> 32:19.080
Leanne!

32:19.960 --> 32:22.120
-Ariel.  Go back again...
-I won't leave her alone.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.760
-We take care of them.
-I'm not in the way either.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.160
I need vasopressors here.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.600
Leanne, please get well.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.680
You have to get well again.

32:30.840 --> 32:35.680
Please open your
eyes, it's okay, it's okay.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.160
Scalpel and thoracotomy cart.
Fast.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.600
Gloves.  We need gloves.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.480
Dr.  Kean.  Respirator.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.640
Still no pulse.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.320
Continue massage until I cut.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.320
The tube is inside.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.760
Rib spreader, please.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.400
More people will die...

33:02.600 --> 33:03.560
That's enough.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.080
Let them take down their
guns and let us through.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.880
What's going on here?  You
should be on the plane to Atlanta.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.320
Your soldier shot someone.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.560
-She's on the Center Stage.
-What?

33:12.760 --> 33:15.840
A man in this tent has
antibodies against the virus.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.680
We take blood from him
for antibody synthesis.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.240
We can stop this.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.040
It stops immediately.  Nobody
is injured or dies anymore.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.720
It is true.
We can save everyone.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.320
Stand back, private.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.520
-Are you going.
-Thank you.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.680
Come on.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.960
Mama says either
you come here to die

33:45.240 --> 33:46.840
or to experience
one final miracle.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.560
Do you want a miracle?

33:51.040 --> 33:52.320
Then be the miracle.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.960
Noa, take the scissors.
Cut the rib.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.640
-Come on.
-Come on.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.840
I can not get through.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.920
I want to help.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.760
All right.  Open it up.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.360
Dr.  Kean, your pericardium
is filled with blood.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.639
The heart cannot beat.
What now?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.960
Cut the pericardium
and find the bleeding.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.560
I agree.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.360
Let's do it.  Dr.
Leighton, cut it.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.080
I found the bleeding.
A hole in the left atrium.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.320
Here's a 3-0.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.679
Fast now.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.040
Brace.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.159
I have it.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
Come on.

34:41.159 --> 34:42.440
Be the miracle.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.520
Be the miracle.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.679
Be the miracle.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.960
Heartbeat.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.640
CT surgery should get ready.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.960
Pedro Chavez.
I need Pedro Chavez.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.960
I'm doing the arterial cut.  Sir

35:13.680 --> 35:14.960
Ready to save your son?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.520
Follow me.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.240
Leanne's values ​​...

35:19.360 --> 35:20.440
What's happening?

35:20.560 --> 35:22.880
We don't have time
for antibody synthesis.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.760
They have the same blood type,

35:24.880 --> 35:26.800
we do a direct
blood transfusion,

35:26.960 --> 35:28.560
its antibodies in
their bloodstream.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
What should I do?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.040
4-0er Prolene, IV bag.  Go now

35:34.440 --> 35:35.400
Where's ariel?

35:36.520 --> 35:37.480
Where's ariel?

35:37.840 --> 35:38.800
She is here.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.760
She is the next.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.000
You can do it, Leanne.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.920
You too.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.960
Can someone at
Dr.  Help Savetti?

35:51.680 --> 35:53.920
Someone has to put them
down immediately.  Come on!

36:14.920 --> 36:15.920
Thank you.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.160
Hey

36:44.440 --> 36:45.520
There is my little one.

36:48.960 --> 36:49.920
Hey

36:50.840 --> 36:52.280
Is everybody fine?

36:52.720 --> 36:53.680
Always play the heroine.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.320
We didn't lose another.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.960
Thank God.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.680
How do you feel?

37:00.200 --> 37:01.760
As bad as you look

37:49.440 --> 37:50.400
Nice that you're here.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.800
Even if I had to catch
a killer virus to do so.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.440
Be quiet.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.360
I still don't flirt.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.200
Leanne, the femoral artery
survived the operation.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.760
I suspect atrial
flutter with deviations.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.320
I say ventricular
tachycardia and you?

38:52.440 --> 38:54.520
AV dissociations with
capture beat, i.e. VT.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.720
I said yes.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.720
Center stage, put a pressure
bandage on your arm.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.040
Cross-test his blood.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.280
I need 5-0 nylon thread.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.800
Don't even think about it.
Go home

39:07.840 --> 39:10.320
I am Jesse Salander, head nurse,

39:10.920 --> 39:13.840
but for the next three
years I'll be your mom.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.480
Hey

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
Time to get up.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.280
No... I don't want to get up.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.520
Everyone has to go to school.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.320
Come over.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.560
I'll see you below.
