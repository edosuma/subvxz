00:00.944 --> 00:02.601
Previously on Gotham...

00:03.812 --> 00:05.383
- Bruce Wayne?
- No.

00:05.476 --> 00:06.609
But you could be.

00:07.306 --> 00:10.409
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

00:10.502 --> 00:12.146
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

00:12.171 --> 00:14.283
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

00:14.308 --> 00:16.079
You're only part of the plan.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.450
You know what must happen

00:18.520 --> 00:19.453
if he refuses.

00:19.521 --> 00:21.589
No one refuses the Court.

00:21.657 --> 00:23.758
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.214
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps.

00:25.252 --> 00:26.737
But telling you your mother
was a con artist

00:26.786 --> 00:28.233
who'd only sought you out
for the purposes of

00:28.258 --> 00:31.655
getting money from me didn't seem like
a very attractive alternative.

00:33.502 --> 00:35.703
I don't love you.

00:35.771 --> 00:37.939
You need me, Edward Nygma!

00:38.006 --> 00:39.874
Just as I need you.

00:39.942 --> 00:41.475
You killed Isabella.

00:41.543 --> 00:43.377
I loved her, Oswald.

01:08.437 --> 01:09.737
Greetings, Professor.

01:09.805 --> 01:11.706
Oh! Somebody help!

01:13.116 --> 01:15.204
The building's empty.
No one's coming to help.

01:16.621 --> 01:17.955
Have a seat.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.782
Wh-Who are you?

01:23.152 --> 01:24.319
That...

01:24.386 --> 01:26.197
is an excellent question.

01:26.355 --> 01:28.775
But I get to ask the first one.

01:30.745 --> 01:34.262
I can fill a room or just one heart.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.659
Others may have me,
but I cannot be shared.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.917
What am I?!

01:38.628 --> 01:40.083
What?

01:40.325 --> 01:42.692
It's a riddle. Answer the riddle!

01:42.747 --> 01:45.039
Uh... I...

01:45.107 --> 01:46.107
Knowledge?

01:47.868 --> 01:50.564
Knowledge can't be shared, Professor?

01:50.650 --> 01:52.525
Really? You are the chair

01:53.103 --> 01:55.298
of a chemistry department.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.845
You've spent a career

01:56.907 --> 01:58.920
sharing knowledge!

01:58.987 --> 02:00.188
No!

02:06.595 --> 02:07.995
I apologize.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.634
I'm not myself these days.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.739
Hands, please.

02:23.764 --> 02:27.014
I can be a member of a group,
but I can never blend in.

02:27.082 --> 02:29.420
- What am I?
- I... Uh...

02:29.826 --> 02:30.918
A shadow?

02:34.238 --> 02:36.439
The answer is an individual.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.882
Duh! I expected more.

02:39.027 --> 02:40.094
But then,

02:40.886 --> 02:42.886
none of the others did very well either.

02:42.972 --> 02:45.199
- The others?
- Oh, you'd know them.

02:47.559 --> 02:48.975
One was an artist,

02:49.082 --> 02:50.585
one was a writer,

02:51.811 --> 02:53.850
one was a philosopher.

02:55.948 --> 03:01.256
The stars of Gotham's
intellectual and artistic...

03:01.482 --> 03:03.082
constellation.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.269
Fallen stars now.

03:05.671 --> 03:07.808
Wh-Why are you doing this?

03:09.366 --> 03:12.058
My best friend recently said

03:12.918 --> 03:16.816
there was no me without him.

03:19.426 --> 03:21.523
I shot him and dumped him in the river.

03:21.609 --> 03:26.156
He was a sort of guide
to me on my journey.

03:26.383 --> 03:29.771
You see, I know who I am, Professor.

03:30.473 --> 03:33.975
It's how to... be him...

03:34.691 --> 03:36.258
that is eluding me.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.686
I seek guidance.

03:39.686 --> 03:42.431
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

03:42.537 --> 03:46.225
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you when you rot.

03:46.287 --> 03:49.703
- What am I?!
- I don't know.

03:51.341 --> 03:53.109
Well, that's just too bad.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.054
No, no!

04:13.713 --> 04:18.853

04:20.077 --> 04:21.644
We'd gone to the movies.

04:21.802 --> 04:24.807
My father wanted to cut through
the alley to get an uptown cab.

04:26.911 --> 04:29.083
The man came out of nowhere.

04:30.213 --> 04:31.858
His face was covered.

04:33.111 --> 04:34.518
He had a gun.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.166
I remember how cold it was.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.510
I heard a cat.

04:40.877 --> 04:42.787
He shot them both, and I did...

04:43.266 --> 04:44.724
I did nothing.

04:48.287 --> 04:50.299
Excellent, my dear.

04:50.716 --> 04:53.757
You truly are Bruce Wayne.

05:03.865 --> 05:04.936
Yes?

05:04.999 --> 05:06.148
We're ready.

05:06.450 --> 05:07.583
Then proceed.

05:07.671 --> 05:08.751
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:08.811 --> 05:12.760
And on your end,
I hope your nephew is amenable.

05:12.901 --> 05:15.651
Should he refuse,
you know what must happen.

05:16.159 --> 05:18.394
I know the rules, Kathryn.

05:24.275 --> 05:26.247
We are to proceed.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.893
Do the rest.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.551
Alfred Pennyworth is my guardian.

05:34.926 --> 05:37.364
He has been with me
since I can remember.

05:40.765 --> 05:43.671
_

06:02.102 --> 06:04.477
What did I tell you
about dripping on the couch?

06:04.641 --> 06:06.609
You are the only person I know
who frets about

06:06.676 --> 06:09.174
his drug-induced hallucination
making a mess.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.987
But...

06:11.487 --> 06:12.840
if it makes you happy.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.075
Thank you.

06:14.150 --> 06:17.010
I wonder how long you will be
the public face of grief

06:17.080 --> 06:19.892
when people hear that
you killed your best friend.

06:24.923 --> 06:26.503
And then there are your

06:27.021 --> 06:29.659
extracurricular activities.

06:30.787 --> 06:33.002
How many are we up to now?

06:33.272 --> 06:35.207
Five? Six?

06:37.029 --> 06:41.237
There was the curator,
the writer... pretentious ass.

06:41.295 --> 06:42.737
So frustrating.

06:44.151 --> 06:48.050
They all fit the profile...
High I.Q., driven, creative.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.567
Yet each one failed.

06:52.644 --> 06:55.347
You must be the first person in
history to go on a killing spree

06:55.409 --> 06:57.050
in order to find a life coach.

06:57.121 --> 06:58.928
Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.

06:59.292 --> 07:00.759
No.

07:00.950 --> 07:03.472
A good riddle reveals the asker.

07:03.497 --> 07:05.817
To solve it is to solve the
mystery of the person posing it.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.314
If I can find someone
to solve my riddles,

07:09.088 --> 07:10.564
I can find someone to help me.

07:10.635 --> 07:12.067
Do you really think
you're gonna find someone

07:12.137 --> 07:13.473
who can teach you how to be a villain?

07:13.553 --> 07:14.653
Yes!

07:14.745 --> 07:16.279
Of course I am.

07:16.541 --> 07:19.935
You said yourself there is no
Edward Nygma without the Penguin.

07:20.278 --> 07:23.419
But knowing who I am...

07:24.216 --> 07:26.638
and knowing how to be him...
those are separate things.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.874
Ed, villains do not have teachers!

07:28.942 --> 07:32.735
I made myself into the Penguin when
I threw Fish Mooney off a building.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.102
I didn't have anyone's help.

07:35.949 --> 07:37.712
Oh, how interesting.

07:38.618 --> 07:40.626
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.592
Obviously.

07:42.738 --> 07:44.423
I don't need a teacher.

07:44.791 --> 07:46.025
I need an enemy.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.682
- No, that is not...
- The greatest villains

07:48.738 --> 07:51.807
have always been defined by
the men that try to stop them!

07:53.643 --> 07:55.144
And I know the perfect man.

07:57.532 --> 07:59.666
Please, do not say...

07:59.734 --> 08:01.502
Jim Gordon.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.455
A serial killer of smart people?

08:06.523 --> 08:08.791
In the last few weeks,
six members of Gotham's

08:08.858 --> 08:12.040
intellectual and artistic elite
have killed themselves

08:12.095 --> 08:13.839
or died in strange accidents?

08:13.933 --> 08:16.933
Last night, an old professor
of mine died in a lab fire.

08:17.190 --> 08:19.941
At a certain point,
coincidence becomes pattern.

08:20.589 --> 08:22.447
You getting bored
down in the lab, Lucius?

08:22.472 --> 08:24.952
Yes, but that is not
why you should look at this.

08:24.977 --> 08:27.810
Listen, we are still finding bodies

08:27.877 --> 08:29.878
from Jerome's night
of murder and mayhem,

08:29.946 --> 08:33.789
not to mention out looking for
our dear missing mayor.

08:33.837 --> 08:38.298
I do not have the resources
to allocate to your hunch.

08:38.376 --> 08:41.048
Did you hear how I used
that word "allocate," hmm?

08:41.821 --> 08:43.256
Let me call Gordon.

08:43.282 --> 08:45.527
No, no. The man's due R&R.

08:45.595 --> 08:49.774
Besides, he's reconnecting with
some long-lost uncle or something.

08:50.392 --> 08:52.975
Jim Gordon? Detective Jim Gordon?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.672
Gordon ain't here.
So give me the message, fruit guy.

What the hell is this?

09:21.869 --> 09:23.836
"Six masters passed."

09:23.923 --> 09:25.776
That could be the six murders.

09:25.846 --> 09:27.104
I told you...

09:27.182 --> 09:29.638
Harvey, the killer's
sending Gordon a clue.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.473
He's gonna kill again.

09:31.541 --> 09:32.641
Okay, say you're right.

09:32.709 --> 09:35.099
- Now, which way is up on this thing?
- Let me see that.

09:35.211 --> 09:36.787
"A king, a queen and her corps..."

09:36.913 --> 09:39.083
It's a drawing of the Knight's Tour.

09:39.249 --> 09:40.449
Right.

09:40.517 --> 09:43.085
So the target is...

09:45.188 --> 09:46.708
Come on.

10:05.842 --> 10:06.909
Thanks for coming.

10:06.976 --> 10:08.477
Like I had a choice?

10:08.665 --> 10:10.283
Oh, you'll thank me.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.775
This is gonna be electrifying.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.161
Knight to Queen 3. Mate in two.

10:29.231 --> 10:30.683
- Shh!
- Quiet, please.

10:30.708 --> 10:31.720
Oh, honestly.

10:31.787 --> 10:34.155
They call anyone a
grandmaster these days.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.125
Can we discuss why you're doing this?

10:38.494 --> 10:40.141
I've told you why.

10:40.213 --> 10:41.273
The real reason.

10:45.368 --> 10:49.072
See, Ed, the trouble with talking to
projections of your psyche...

10:49.338 --> 10:51.486
and you of all people
should know this...

10:51.830 --> 10:55.181
is that they know everything you know.

10:55.470 --> 10:58.480
Including the things
you're trying not to know.

10:58.548 --> 11:00.522
Gordon can't help you.

11:00.936 --> 11:02.506
No one can.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.233
Face the truth.

11:17.033 --> 11:19.089
Excuse me, sir.

11:19.566 --> 11:21.642
No Jim Gordon.

11:22.038 --> 11:23.872
Well, then who solved...

11:23.940 --> 11:26.308
All right, officers. Of course.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.676
- How can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am,

11:27.743 --> 11:29.744
we need to evacuate
the building immediately.

11:30.025 --> 11:31.813
We're in the middle
of an important tournament.

11:31.881 --> 11:33.048
Are you sure?

11:33.115 --> 11:34.625
Maybe I was wrong.

11:34.711 --> 11:36.649
Maybe this isn't the place.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.682
Oh, how interesting.

11:41.143 --> 11:42.257
Checkmate!

11:44.702 --> 11:46.828
GCPD! Everybody out!

11:48.375 --> 11:49.889
Don't move! Freeze!

11:49.914 --> 11:52.246
Forget what I just said. Freeze.

11:52.271 --> 11:54.308
Do not move.

11:56.671 --> 11:58.171
Why am I here, Uncle Frank?

11:58.196 --> 11:59.496
Maybe you want to tell me

11:59.521 --> 12:01.622
where the hell you've been
since I was a kid?

12:01.776 --> 12:03.679
Or what happened between you and my dad?

12:03.744 --> 12:05.512
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:06.694 --> 12:09.101
But I need to know that you trust me.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.954
You're family. Course I trust you.

12:13.257 --> 12:16.324
Did you ever do something
you thought was right at the time,

12:16.685 --> 12:19.747
but would now give your life to do over?

12:20.830 --> 12:22.302
Yes.

12:22.431 --> 12:25.183
Looking back, I've done too many
terrible things like that.

12:25.568 --> 12:28.957
But the worst
was break from your father.

12:29.425 --> 12:31.006
Keep talking.

12:31.073 --> 12:32.907
I loved my brother Peter dearly.

12:33.371 --> 12:35.343
And you're my brother's son.

12:35.658 --> 12:38.494
I came back to Gotham
because of you, Jim.

12:39.548 --> 12:41.816
I want to make things right between us.

12:44.127 --> 12:46.354
So you shift your weight
to your front foot

12:46.422 --> 12:47.555
as you swing your arm forward.

12:47.623 --> 12:49.090
Just like chopping down a branch.

12:49.158 --> 12:51.426
Like, so. Easy as pie.

12:51.990 --> 12:53.762
Right, so, weight on the back foot.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.328
Blade comes back evenly.

12:56.353 --> 12:57.599
- Shh.
- And... What?

12:57.667 --> 13:00.876
Precision under pressure
is everything, Master Bruce.

13:04.332 --> 13:06.052
And a clear conscience.

13:08.511 --> 13:09.878
Were you aiming for the window,
Master Bruce?

13:09.945 --> 13:10.979
You keep distracting me.

13:11.047 --> 13:13.181
Well, you should be able to hit the
target regardless, shouldn't you?

13:13.249 --> 13:15.853
I mean, you had rules about training,

13:15.924 --> 13:18.053
rules which would be
impossible to stand by

13:18.120 --> 13:19.826
if you remain unfocused.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.373
Now, I sense there's something weighing

13:22.992 --> 13:24.553
on your mind.

13:24.894 --> 13:26.596
Miss Kyle, perhaps?

13:26.674 --> 13:28.363
I'm not unfocused because of Selina.

13:28.431 --> 13:29.892
Oh, right. I see. Right.

13:29.963 --> 13:31.804
So it wouldn't trouble you to
know that she dropped a note off

13:31.829 --> 13:34.413
for you in the mailbox, then.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.202
She asked to see you.

13:36.318 --> 13:37.554
Tomorrow.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.456
No.

13:43.584 --> 13:46.286
Selina's been avoiding me for weeks.

13:46.449 --> 13:49.068
It's gonna take more than a note
to have me running.

14:01.811 --> 14:03.465
I got Alvarez and Campos looking

14:03.490 --> 14:04.809
into the other egghead deaths.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.167
Hopefully, something will kick up.

14:06.219 --> 14:07.825
Or else we can sit around
and wait for him

14:07.850 --> 14:09.270
to send us more singing fruit.

14:09.338 --> 14:11.740
Maybe he has sent us a clue.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.361
Oh.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.619
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.182
You're late.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.785
I expected this call seven minutes ago.

14:23.948 --> 14:26.409
This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.

14:26.434 --> 14:28.587
I know who you are, Mr. Fox.

14:28.796 --> 14:31.666
And by the way, it's bad manners
to intercept other people's mail.

14:31.744 --> 14:33.895
You mean the telegram you sent Gordon.

14:33.963 --> 14:35.835
He's not here. Who is this?

14:35.921 --> 14:38.131
You don't actually expect me
to answer that, do you?

14:38.156 --> 14:40.168
Then tell me why you killed
Professor Dyson and the others.

14:40.236 --> 14:42.203
- I know it was you.
- I had no choice.

14:42.271 --> 14:43.805
They failed my test.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.664
Now it's your turn to try.

14:45.775 --> 14:48.610
And if I don't accept the invitation?

14:48.677 --> 14:51.446
There are lives at stake, Mr. Fox.

14:51.514 --> 14:53.963
Not just your own. Now, listen closely.

14:54.041 --> 14:56.190
Tomorrow, when the pawn's on queen,

14:56.283 --> 14:58.623
you'll find my next target
in the belly of the beast.

14:58.687 --> 15:01.865
Solve my clue, Mr. Fox,

15:01.936 --> 15:05.979
and you'll be one step closer
to passing my test.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.955
- When the pawn's on queen?
- Belly of the beast.

15:12.557 --> 15:14.461
And I'll be one step closer

15:14.664 --> 15:16.773
to introducing myself to Gotham.

15:17.835 --> 15:19.636
Once and for all.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.343
Close.

15:35.411 --> 15:37.078
Better luck next time.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.033
I missed on purpose.

15:39.148 --> 15:40.715
Oh?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.017
Wanted to make sure my gun works.

15:43.085 --> 15:44.385
Oh, come on, Jim.

15:45.171 --> 15:47.468
- What do you take me for?
- I have no idea.

15:47.812 --> 15:50.023
You say you've done terrible
things, you bring me out here,

15:50.085 --> 15:52.247
you promise me the truth,
and I'm still waiting.

15:52.342 --> 15:55.795
If this is a trust-building
exercise, it's not working.

15:56.846 --> 15:59.275
What happened between you and my father?

16:02.540 --> 16:05.820
Have you ever heard the old Gotham
tales about the Court of Owls?

16:09.825 --> 16:11.459
Pretend I haven't.

16:13.329 --> 16:14.963
The Court is a secret society

16:15.347 --> 16:17.593
that's controlled Gotham for centuries.

16:17.767 --> 16:21.687
Started by its oldest, wealthiest,
most influential families.

16:21.837 --> 16:23.204
The Court was once a mechanism

16:23.272 --> 16:25.773
devoted to maintaining
balance in Gotham.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.977
But time and power have corrupted them.

16:29.425 --> 16:31.691
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.902
Your father and I were both members.

16:35.651 --> 16:37.152
I still am a member.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.025
Is that so?

16:44.234 --> 16:45.927
The Court doesn't mean you any harm.

16:46.242 --> 16:48.187
They have the highest regard for you.

16:48.631 --> 16:50.732
In fact, they want you
to become a member.

16:55.399 --> 16:57.672
Peters, we got a tip from a guy

16:57.740 --> 17:01.109
who electrocuted a bunch of players
at a fancy chess tournament,

17:01.177 --> 17:03.011
pointing us to a pawn on queens.

17:03.079 --> 17:06.079
Now, here, you work at a
pawn shop on Queens Avenue.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.388
Coincidence? No.

17:07.450 --> 17:09.818
So? I don't know nothing about that.

17:09.885 --> 17:11.675
Why are you so close to me?

17:11.965 --> 17:13.855
Many interrogators employ the tactic

17:13.923 --> 17:17.050
of invading someone's personal
space to destabilize them.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.227
Do you feel destabilized, Mr. Peters?

17:20.099 --> 17:21.473
Is this guy even a cop?

17:21.546 --> 17:23.765
Hey! We can do this the
hard way or the easy way,

17:23.833 --> 17:25.288
and I'm wearing my nicest suit.

17:25.313 --> 17:27.502
- So I prefer the easy way.
- Hey, screw you.

17:27.569 --> 17:29.471
All right. Lucius, hit him.

17:29.538 --> 17:30.705
- What?
- What?

17:30.773 --> 17:32.073
I'm wearing my nice suit.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.373
We're disregarding
the latter half of the clue.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.289
It said we'd find the target
in the belly of the beast.

17:36.328 --> 17:38.913
Oh. If you want to do a cavity search

17:38.981 --> 17:40.789
on this slob, go ahead, be my guest.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.684
- Hey, you could just hit me.
- No one's hitting anyone.

17:42.751 --> 17:44.095
I wasn't even supposed to work today.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.128
I was covering for Teddy Thirio,
the owner's cousin.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.623
Thirio?

17:48.890 --> 17:50.625
That's the Greek word for beast.

17:50.693 --> 17:53.990
You know, sometimes I think you
just make that stuff up. Come on.

17:59.902 --> 18:01.232
What are you making?

18:02.716 --> 18:04.459
- Shepherd's pie.
- Again?

18:04.537 --> 18:07.131
Well, you're more than welcome
to take over the menu, Master Bruce.

18:07.224 --> 18:08.307
Did I ever tell you

18:08.381 --> 18:11.055
how I copped this recipe
from an old lady friend of mine?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.247
Sylvia.

18:12.314 --> 18:14.682
A memorable fling.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.651
Ended badly, though.

18:16.719 --> 18:18.987
Can't remember what we rowed
about, something idiotic.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.189
It left me reeling, Master Bruce.

18:21.257 --> 18:23.958
- I couldn't concentrate on my studies.
- Really?

18:24.026 --> 18:25.893
You think telling me
a transparent anecdote

18:25.918 --> 18:27.562
- will make me run to Selina?
- No, I don't.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.697
You see, Sylvia and I, we got closure.

18:29.850 --> 18:31.622
Now, it seems that
Miss Kyle has offered you

18:31.647 --> 18:33.998
the same opportunity,
and I suggest that you...

18:34.316 --> 18:35.605
you take it.

18:41.510 --> 18:42.810
Fine.

18:44.822 --> 18:46.334
If it'll get you to stop, I'll go.

18:46.682 --> 18:49.538
I'll keep the pie warm
for you, Master Bruce.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.710
Thirio's not in his apartment.

18:53.093 --> 18:55.311
Have Campos put out a citywide BOLO.

18:55.796 --> 18:58.828
I'm going to the academy
graduation. I have to, uh...

18:58.976 --> 19:01.296
impart my wisdom on the new cadets.

19:01.363 --> 19:02.430
How do I look?

19:03.164 --> 19:05.166
Is this what Gordon deals with?

19:05.328 --> 19:06.813
Thank you.

19:07.169 --> 19:08.937
Have you seen my badge?

19:10.372 --> 19:13.775
The Chess Killer. How terrifying.

19:13.842 --> 19:16.578
How will anyone sleep knowing
the Chess Killer's on the loose?

19:16.645 --> 19:18.479
It's just a name
dreamed up by some hack.

19:18.547 --> 19:19.814
Today will change everything.

19:19.882 --> 19:21.216
This is a mistake, what you're doing.

19:21.283 --> 19:22.584
I don't recall asking you.

19:22.651 --> 19:24.419
I showed you how to be Ed Nygma,

19:24.486 --> 19:26.087
a man who could run the underworld

19:26.155 --> 19:28.135
and operate in plain sight.

19:28.206 --> 19:30.190
What you are planning is madness.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.694
No. It's a way forward.

19:32.761 --> 19:34.829
And the fact that it scares you

19:34.897 --> 19:36.855
gives me all the confirmation I need.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.499
Ed, you are not sleeping.

19:38.567 --> 19:39.701
You are taking drugs.

19:39.768 --> 19:42.136
You are having a conversation
with your dead friend.

19:42.191 --> 19:44.220
Just admit that you are lost without me

19:44.274 --> 19:46.165
or you will destroy everything!

19:46.242 --> 19:47.978
I have to go.

19:52.281 --> 19:53.481
What are you doing?

19:54.783 --> 19:56.451
♪ He's fierce in my dreams ♪

19:56.518 --> 19:57.971
♪ Seizing my guts ♪

19:58.190 --> 20:01.535
♪ He floats me with dread ♪

20:01.613 --> 20:03.340
♪ Soaked in soul ♪

20:03.394 --> 20:08.062
♪ He swims in my eyes by the bed ♪

20:08.130 --> 20:11.106
♪ Pour myself over him ♪

20:11.160 --> 20:14.996
♪ Moon spilling in ♪

20:15.565 --> 20:17.739
♪ And I wake up ♪

20:17.806 --> 20:20.368
♪ Alone ♪

20:20.393 --> 20:21.976
Enough!

20:22.044 --> 20:24.679
I admit that killing you
killed a part of me!

20:25.452 --> 20:28.929
But I will find a way
forward no matter the cost.

20:29.484 --> 20:31.719
I will be born anew!

20:31.827 --> 20:33.788
And I will leave you behind.

20:33.856 --> 20:35.223
Penguin saw you, Ed.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.825
He was the only one. He made you!

20:37.893 --> 20:41.829
There is no Ed Nygma
without the Penguin!

20:42.382 --> 20:45.589
Meet Ted Thirio...
came in about an hour ago.

20:45.675 --> 20:48.036
Cause of death seems to be
blunt force trauma to the head.

20:48.103 --> 20:49.785
However, Mr. Thirio also has

20:49.847 --> 20:51.886
a long incision along
the right side of his abdomen

20:51.972 --> 20:53.808
that's been crudely stapled shut.

20:53.876 --> 20:57.371
The Chess Killer promised a clue
inside the belly of the beast.

20:57.441 --> 20:59.380
Think there might be
something in his stomach?

21:00.112 --> 21:01.371
Okay.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.318
You worked at Arkham Asylum.

21:03.855 --> 21:07.755
Why would a killer engage
in this kind of cat and mouse?

21:07.823 --> 21:10.814
Crazy or sane, at the core,
most people just want answers

21:10.839 --> 21:12.193
to life's big questions.

21:12.261 --> 21:13.853
"Will I ever be loved?"

21:13.878 --> 21:15.063
"Who am I?"

21:15.130 --> 21:16.829
Although most people try
to answer the question

21:16.868 --> 21:18.532
in a logical fashion, while...

21:18.867 --> 21:20.415
others...

21:23.038 --> 21:24.626
Hmm.

21:25.007 --> 21:27.826
Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge
inside a dead body.

21:27.897 --> 21:29.097
What does that mean?

21:29.177 --> 21:30.818
Means I know who the next target is.

21:30.888 --> 21:32.287
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Uh...

21:32.373 --> 21:35.049
Thank you, Doctor. Sorry.
I know. Thank you.

21:39.081 --> 21:43.465
"As you take the badge today,
approach Gotham as you would...

21:44.059 --> 21:46.561
"a cut of prime rib.

21:46.832 --> 21:49.664
"Have a plan, don't be afraid,

21:49.732 --> 21:53.134
and have plenty of antacids
on hand in case of indigestion."

21:57.290 --> 21:58.774
What the hell are you doing here?

21:58.874 --> 22:01.680
Well, seeing as how your department

22:01.774 --> 22:03.844
is unable to locate our missing mayor,

22:03.954 --> 22:06.547
I'm here to give the graduating class
a few remarks in his stead.

22:06.615 --> 22:10.735
There's no way I'm letting a cop-killer
address those cadets.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.016
I see.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.609
How is the view from
the moral high ground, Harvey?

22:14.687 --> 22:16.086
View's perfect.

22:16.141 --> 22:17.453
Now get lost.

22:19.361 --> 22:21.496
Oh, Lucius Fox.

22:21.656 --> 22:23.786
Must be about me.

22:27.224 --> 22:29.832
_

22:32.857 --> 22:34.303
Want to play?

22:34.328 --> 22:36.263
Come on, you guys want to play?
You want to play?

22:36.288 --> 22:38.222
Come on.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.715
I'm looking for Selina Kyle!

22:45.856 --> 22:47.957
Oh, I remember you. Bruce Wayne.

22:48.036 --> 22:50.262
- Listen, I don't want any trouble.
- You sure?

22:51.047 --> 22:52.555
- How much cash you got?
- Get him, Sonny.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.422
Stop!

22:54.711 --> 22:57.313
Sonny, I said back off!

23:00.915 --> 23:03.382
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

23:04.296 --> 23:06.186
- Can we go somewhere?
- No.

23:07.091 --> 23:08.994
I got to talk to Sonny.

23:09.193 --> 23:10.580
We got business.

23:11.896 --> 23:12.929
Oh.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.598
Does that shock
your tender sensibilities?

23:15.666 --> 23:17.094
- He's a thief.
- I'm a thief.

23:17.119 --> 23:19.002
- You can't trust him.
- But I can trust you?

23:19.069 --> 23:20.436
Look, I'm sorry.

23:20.785 --> 23:22.995
I should've told you I suspected
your mother of lying.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.942
- I was trying to protect you, Selina.
- I can protect myself.

23:27.109 --> 23:28.876
Just go home, Bruce.

23:30.481 --> 23:32.402
You don't belong here.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.909
Why'd you ask me here
if were going to be this way?

23:38.970 --> 23:40.282
What are you talking about?

23:40.798 --> 23:42.859
The note you left in my mailbox.

23:43.782 --> 23:46.124
I didn't leave any note.

23:47.085 --> 23:50.402
Don't come looking for me again.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.398
We'll talk later, Sonny.

23:57.315 --> 23:59.753
Too bad your girlfriend split.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.846
I don't think she's my girlfriend.

24:06.050 --> 24:07.807
Me neither.

24:08.854 --> 24:10.940
So about that money.

24:14.970 --> 24:16.203
My turn.

24:17.261 --> 24:21.086
Oh, poor Brucey.

24:22.566 --> 24:24.367
Staying down there, boy, big boy?

24:24.435 --> 24:25.635
Oh.

24:25.703 --> 24:27.570
Oh, he's up. Big boy.

24:45.839 --> 24:47.994
Hello, cadets.

24:48.549 --> 24:51.096
My name is Edward Nygma.

24:51.353 --> 24:54.041
Captain Bullock's... tied up.

24:55.659 --> 24:57.034
What a day.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.901
Eh?

24:59.120 --> 25:02.862
You all look just dandy
in your uniforms.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.024
How do I look?

25:07.031 --> 25:08.645
I have one question for all of you:

25:09.289 --> 25:13.281
Light as a feather,
yet no man can hold it long.

25:14.082 --> 25:15.516
What am I?

25:21.440 --> 25:24.027
Well, no future commissioners here.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.162
The answer is...

25:35.723 --> 25:37.176
...your breath.

25:51.944 --> 25:54.456
- Think that's for me.
- You Foxy?

25:54.670 --> 25:55.913
Nygma.

26:00.234 --> 26:01.430
Hello.

26:01.524 --> 26:03.515
Only one person refers to me as Foxy.

26:03.540 --> 26:06.735
I have gassed a room full of
folks with a deadly toxin.

26:06.813 --> 26:09.484
I cordially invite you to come upstairs

26:09.554 --> 26:11.578
and play a game with me
for the antidote.

26:11.646 --> 26:13.859
This is game between me and you.

26:13.937 --> 26:18.787
Come upstairs alone,
or the cadets and Bullock die.

26:18.883 --> 26:20.617
I'm on my way.

26:26.928 --> 26:28.662
Well, look who it is.

26:28.794 --> 26:31.583
I'm so glad you decided to play.

26:31.699 --> 26:32.866
Are you okay, Harvey?

26:33.316 --> 26:35.138
Look at him.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.230
He's fine.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.529
I want to hear Harvey say he's okay.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.410
Don't try and outsmart
this lunatic, Lucius!

26:43.477 --> 26:45.712
Cadets' lives are at stake.

26:46.653 --> 26:48.457
Let's begin.

26:48.544 --> 26:49.980
Wonderful.

26:50.058 --> 26:52.118
I will give you three riddles.

26:52.574 --> 26:56.100
For every riddle you get wrong,
I cut a rope.

26:56.162 --> 26:57.772
You get three wrong,

26:57.866 --> 26:59.817
and this excuse for a higher primate

26:59.842 --> 27:01.806
and the antidote

27:01.875 --> 27:03.610
around his neck...

27:05.439 --> 27:07.534
...fall over the ledge.

27:09.489 --> 27:11.786
Wow.

27:12.356 --> 27:13.890
Am I clear?

27:14.052 --> 27:15.442
And if I get them right?

27:16.098 --> 27:17.467
Everyone lives!

27:17.545 --> 27:20.522
Even if you get just one.

27:20.695 --> 27:22.630
Can't say fairer than that.

27:24.585 --> 27:25.919
Okay.

27:27.149 --> 27:29.115
Wonderful.

27:29.311 --> 27:30.708
First riddle.

27:30.787 --> 27:33.967
I can fill a room or just one heart.

27:34.061 --> 27:36.834
Others can have me, but I can't be shared.

27:36.935 --> 27:38.771
What am I?

27:39.033 --> 27:41.070
The answer's love.

27:41.802 --> 27:43.503
What?

27:43.899 --> 27:45.103
No.

27:46.121 --> 27:47.255
No!

27:47.587 --> 27:51.211
The... the answer is loneliness!

27:51.279 --> 27:53.346
How do you not know that?!

27:53.414 --> 27:54.548
No, no, no.

27:54.615 --> 27:57.597
No, Nygma. No, no! Oh, God!

28:04.664 --> 28:06.198
Ask me another.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.358
Okay. Second riddle.

28:08.506 --> 28:11.615
I can be a member of a group,
but can never blend in.

28:11.805 --> 28:13.505
What am I?

28:16.143 --> 28:17.392
A snowflake.

28:17.511 --> 28:19.345
A sn...

28:19.761 --> 28:20.827
No!

28:20.957 --> 28:22.822
No! No!

28:22.954 --> 28:25.642
The answer is an individual!

28:25.848 --> 28:27.103
Wait!

28:27.173 --> 28:29.900
Snowflake is also a suitable answer.

28:29.962 --> 28:32.274
No two are alike,
making them by definition

28:32.341 --> 28:34.943
individuals... therefore an answer

28:35.011 --> 28:36.278
befitting your riddle.

28:36.353 --> 28:40.293
Okay. I don't think you grasp
how this works.

28:40.387 --> 28:42.613
You have to give my answer.

28:47.432 --> 28:50.811
Oh, Mama! I'm sorry! Oh, God!

28:52.933 --> 28:54.500
Oswald was right.

28:54.661 --> 28:56.708
He's the only one...

28:58.157 --> 28:59.729
No!

28:59.791 --> 29:01.541
It's just you.

29:02.182 --> 29:05.044
You aren't a good enough enemy!

29:07.521 --> 29:09.893
No. No.

29:11.572 --> 29:14.158
No. Three riddles.

29:14.228 --> 29:16.556
Three answers. Those are the rules, Ed.

29:16.642 --> 29:18.932
Okay. Final riddle.

29:19.026 --> 29:21.831
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

29:21.964 --> 29:24.967
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

29:25.011 --> 29:26.193
What am I?

29:26.275 --> 29:27.850
What did you do, Ed?

29:28.772 --> 29:30.248
What did you...

29:30.441 --> 29:32.264
What happened to Penguin?

29:34.934 --> 29:37.213
Something happened, didn't it?

29:40.750 --> 29:42.384
Did you kill him?

29:43.653 --> 29:46.222
This is not gonna be good.
This is not gonna be good.

29:46.289 --> 29:48.950
- You did, didn't you?
- I feel your every thought...

29:49.059 --> 29:52.217
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

29:52.287 --> 29:55.826
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

29:55.951 --> 29:57.404
What am I?!

29:58.709 --> 30:00.369
A reflection.

30:00.917 --> 30:03.667
Why does it always
have to be three answers?!

30:03.745 --> 30:05.941
Why can't he get four?! Come on!

30:06.503 --> 30:08.416
Correct.

30:12.175 --> 30:13.642
Oops.

30:22.826 --> 30:24.660
Thanks, buddy.

30:24.728 --> 30:26.462
I never doubted you.

30:52.389 --> 30:53.689
You.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.237
What are you doing here?

30:57.727 --> 30:59.328
It's good to see you, too.

30:59.885 --> 31:01.747
How'd things go with Selina?

31:03.079 --> 31:04.426
How did you...?

31:06.474 --> 31:07.859
You sent that note.

31:12.678 --> 31:14.532
And you're dressed like me.

31:14.771 --> 31:16.678
- Even your hair.
- Yes.

31:17.115 --> 31:19.328
Like looking into a mirror.

31:21.728 --> 31:23.863
Powerful knockout drug.

31:30.627 --> 31:31.927
Why?

31:32.111 --> 31:35.464
This... is what I was made for.

31:41.688 --> 31:46.102
To be Bruce Wayne.

31:52.126 --> 31:54.360
How could you, how could my father

31:54.462 --> 31:56.446
have been a part of this?

31:56.607 --> 31:58.341
We were proud to join.

31:59.241 --> 32:00.901
We thought we were gonna do good.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.604
The Court lied to us.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.772
Or we lied to ourselves. I don't know.

32:06.882 --> 32:08.208
And now?

32:08.276 --> 32:09.976
You're still a loyal member?

32:10.044 --> 32:11.411
They think so.

32:11.479 --> 32:14.739
I was a true believer. God help me.

32:16.138 --> 32:18.568
I despise them with
every bone in my body.

32:18.678 --> 32:20.854
What changed your mind?

32:20.922 --> 32:22.022
Your father

32:22.264 --> 32:23.824
saw through their lies.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.607
I didn't listen to him
until it was too late.

32:26.961 --> 32:28.740
When was too late?

32:29.715 --> 32:31.216
When they killed him.

32:31.294 --> 32:32.332
No.

32:33.107 --> 32:34.507
No, I was there.

32:34.609 --> 32:37.137
It was an accident, a drunk driver.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.172
Just looked that way.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.875
I was there! I was in the wreck.

32:41.943 --> 32:43.210
I watched him die.

32:43.277 --> 32:45.579
Car wrecks like that are
simple business for the Court.

32:46.044 --> 32:49.216
My brother was making trouble,
and they killed him.

32:49.283 --> 32:50.984
As sure as I'm standing here now.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.099
Now?!

32:53.988 --> 32:56.690
Some 20 odd years later,
and you come and you tell me

32:56.758 --> 32:58.859
this crazy story.
Where the hell have you been?!

32:58.926 --> 33:00.994
Where were you when
my mom and I needed you?

33:01.062 --> 33:03.499
I'm truly sorry I wasn't
there for you, Jim.

33:03.831 --> 33:05.585
I had no choice.

33:05.867 --> 33:08.702
The Court sent me overseas.
I had to prove my loyalty.

33:09.202 --> 33:11.238
Why would you prove
your loyalty to a group

33:11.305 --> 33:12.706
that murdered your own brother?

33:13.025 --> 33:15.108
I knew they'd kill me if I didn't obey.

33:15.176 --> 33:16.955
I chose to live.

33:17.470 --> 33:19.012
Until now.

33:19.197 --> 33:20.280
Why now?

33:20.348 --> 33:22.676
Because now you've been
asked to join the Court.

33:22.762 --> 33:24.567
Now I'm not alone.

33:25.887 --> 33:27.333
Now...

33:28.389 --> 33:30.524
you can help me destroy
them from within.

33:31.137 --> 33:33.160
Others have tried and failed,

33:33.549 --> 33:36.939
but with you and I working
together inside the Court,

33:37.072 --> 33:38.884
we could bring the rule
of democracy and law

33:38.970 --> 33:40.934
- back to Gotham.
- Why should I trust you?

33:41.002 --> 33:42.235
Why should I believe you?

33:42.767 --> 33:44.577
Because we're family?

33:46.759 --> 33:48.975
You have to believe in something.

33:51.461 --> 33:53.513
And while all
the cadets survived the attack,

33:53.581 --> 33:54.948
police say the culprit,

33:55.016 --> 33:58.306
former mayoral chief of staff
Edward Nygma, remains at large.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.986
Be on the lookout for a green suit.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.355
- That's right...
- Good evening, Alfred.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.624
And to you, Master Bruce.

34:05.064 --> 34:06.674
Well, you seem remarkably chipper.

34:06.736 --> 34:08.524
Things went well with
Ms. Kyle, I take it?

34:08.549 --> 34:10.469
Selina's Selina.

34:10.556 --> 34:11.719
Ah, say no more.

34:11.766 --> 34:14.252
You spoke. That's all
that matters. Isn't it?

34:15.576 --> 34:17.137
You up for some shepherd's pie, then?

34:17.739 --> 34:19.647
Sounds delicious.

34:20.357 --> 34:22.029
Right. Jolly good.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.755
I'll be a mo.

34:30.983 --> 34:33.386
Team, spread out.

34:33.913 --> 34:35.480
Lock down egress.

34:35.608 --> 34:37.471
- We're all clear.
- Clear.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.899
Now upstairs.

34:41.784 --> 34:43.284
We're clear.

34:44.429 --> 34:46.337
Captain, all clear.

34:48.741 --> 34:49.993
I know.

34:50.094 --> 34:52.132
He's not here.

35:20.004 --> 35:21.854
Hello, Foxy.

35:26.227 --> 35:28.858
So, the antidote around Bullock's neck,

35:28.883 --> 35:31.117
that turned out to be grape juice.

35:31.211 --> 35:35.914
And the deadly toxin:
plain old knockout gas.

35:36.165 --> 35:37.532
Why the charade?

35:37.975 --> 35:40.319
Well, the point wasn't
to kill a bunch of cops.

35:40.468 --> 35:43.835
The point was to have you play my game.

35:43.905 --> 35:45.407
But you killed Penguin,

35:45.474 --> 35:47.852
and you killed Professor Dyson
and the others.

35:48.144 --> 35:49.602
Why?

35:50.116 --> 35:53.672
Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?

35:54.517 --> 35:56.455
I'm not sure what you mean.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.448
All my life...

36:01.643 --> 36:05.424
I felt like there was
someone inside of me,

36:05.694 --> 36:08.396
someone stronger and...

36:08.562 --> 36:10.562
and smarter.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.034
Someone that people would fear.

36:13.102 --> 36:14.436
No one else saw that.

36:14.503 --> 36:15.937
Except Penguin?

36:19.056 --> 36:21.509
- Except Oswald.
- So, why did you kill him?

36:21.782 --> 36:24.392
Because Oswald killed the woman I loved.

36:25.415 --> 36:28.983
And with Oswald gone, is that
the role I'm meant to fill?

36:29.344 --> 36:31.961
- To be your reflection?
- No.

36:32.254 --> 36:34.656
Because I know who I am.

36:35.203 --> 36:38.460
I know how to be him.

36:41.912 --> 36:43.904
And you helped that.

36:44.033 --> 36:45.233
So thank you.

36:45.856 --> 36:47.089
Ed.

36:51.173 --> 36:53.107
You killed six people.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.945
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven, including Penguin.

36:56.350 --> 37:00.072
You just announced to the entire city
that you are a villain and a murderer.

37:00.558 --> 37:01.883
Mm-hmm.

37:02.293 --> 37:03.309
Ed,

37:03.488 --> 37:07.062
if there is any part of
your mind that is not insane,

37:07.323 --> 37:08.957
listen to me.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.327
You need help.

37:12.812 --> 37:14.734
Turn yourself in.

37:18.167 --> 37:20.154
My actions seem...

37:21.318 --> 37:23.061
mad to you?

37:24.940 --> 37:26.529
To anyone.

37:29.178 --> 37:30.434
I...

37:34.149 --> 37:36.044
I just...

37:36.708 --> 37:39.621
killed the best friend
that I have ever had.

37:42.247 --> 37:45.827
My search for a teacher or an enemy...

37:48.817 --> 37:51.165
...that was just me trying to hold
onto him for a little bit longer.

37:51.963 --> 37:54.572
But now I know who I am...

37:55.939 --> 37:58.039
without him.

37:58.213 --> 37:59.641
So, who are you now?

38:00.748 --> 38:02.733
Oh, come on, Foxy.

38:06.218 --> 38:08.147
I'm the Riddler.

38:34.315 --> 38:36.565
I've always loved the view from here.

38:36.995 --> 38:39.914
Not really a fan. You understand why.

38:44.462 --> 38:47.233
I want you to know that our friendship
meant something to me.

38:49.522 --> 38:52.927
I cared about you, and I miss you.

38:54.907 --> 38:57.789
Gee, almost makes up for being dead.

38:57.922 --> 39:01.583
You do know the entire
GCPD is hunting you?

39:02.106 --> 39:03.208
Yes.

39:03.270 --> 39:06.196
Well, not to burst your bubble,

39:06.267 --> 39:09.946
but wanted or not,
no one is going to be afraid of

39:10.010 --> 39:11.845
the Riddler.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.850
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.642
Good-bye, Oswald.

40:16.245 --> 40:17.745
Well...

40:18.550 --> 40:20.610
look who's alive.

40:23.415 --> 40:24.725
Who are you?

40:24.829 --> 40:26.654
Ivy Pepper. Are you stupid?

40:29.224 --> 40:30.892
Do we know each other?

40:31.240 --> 40:32.729
I pulled you out of the river.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.237
Been nursing you for weeks.

40:35.495 --> 40:36.864
So boring.

40:36.932 --> 40:38.366
You sleep a lot.

40:42.619 --> 40:44.839
You look strange,
like you're gonna puke.

40:44.907 --> 40:46.572
Are you okay?

40:53.637 --> 40:55.293
I just remembered...

40:55.841 --> 40:58.326
there's someone I need to kill.

41:08.711 --> 41:10.164
Uncle Frank?

41:27.371 --> 41:31.014
_

41:35.389 --> 41:38.139
- How did he take it?
- His interest is piqued,

41:38.475 --> 41:40.520
but convincing him will take some time.

41:40.567 --> 41:42.614
We don't have time.

41:43.309 --> 41:45.528
I won't let you down, Kathryn.

41:45.606 --> 41:47.942
I assume things went
smoothly on your end?

41:48.169 --> 41:50.271
The clone is in place.

41:51.503 --> 41:53.304
What about Bruce Wayne?

41:55.361 --> 41:58.046
He should be waking up as we speak.

42:37.440 --> 42:42.440
