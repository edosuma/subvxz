WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:07.075
LAURA, TELL MOM
I'M MEETING THE GUYS

00:07.141 --> 00:08.409
TO PLAY BASKETBALL.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.212
TELL HER YOURSELF.
I'M NOT YOUR SECRETARY.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.822
HI, EDDIE.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.391
HI, STEVE.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.993
YOU READY TO DRIBBLE
THE OLD ROUND BALL?

00:26.060 --> 00:29.197
SHOOT SOME HOOPS?
BANG THE BOARDS?

00:32.300 --> 00:35.269
URKEL, WHY DO YOU
PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.405
NOBODY EVER PICKS YOU
FOR THEIR TEAM.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.507
I WAS CLOSE
LAST TIME.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.211
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN IF
SHEILA SCHWARTZ HADN'T SHOWN UP.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.914
YEAH, IT WAS
PRETTY AMAZING

00:46.980 --> 00:50.651
HOW WELL SHE PLAYED
IN THOSE HIGH HEELS.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.320
NICE SOCKS.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.521
SEE YOU.

00:54.855 --> 00:59.227
SO, LAURA, WANT TO PLAY
SOME ONE-ON-ONE?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.030
NO, I DON'T.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.332
AND WHY DON'T YOU
STICK TO CHESS?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.134
YEAH, IT'S
MORE YOUR GAME.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.035
NO, I'VE BEEN
PRACTICING.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.570
WATCH THIS.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.445
DID I DO THAT?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.715
NO, IT'S THE PRIZE
THAT CAME WITH THE CEREAL.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.931
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:37.998 --> 01:39.400
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:39.467 --> 01:42.736
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:42.803 --> 01:46.174
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:46.240 --> 01:50.644
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:50.711 --> 01:54.047
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:54.114 --> 01:57.951
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:58.018 --> 02:01.622
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

02:01.689 --> 02:05.759
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

02:06.560 --> 02:09.630
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:09.697 --> 02:13.501
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

02:13.567 --> 02:16.604
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

02:16.670 --> 02:20.408
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

02:20.474 --> 02:23.611
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:23.677 --> 02:27.215
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,
ROOM FOR ME *

02:27.281 --> 02:31.285
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:31.352 --> 02:34.555
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:34.622 --> 02:38.792
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

03:00.214 --> 03:02.115
THE GREATEST THING
HAPPENED AT WORK.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.785
ONE OF THE GUYS
IN PRODUCE GOT FIRED.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.254
WHY'S THAT GREAT?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.655
WELL, IT'S NOT
GREAT THAT HE GOT FIRED.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.990
BUT IT'S GREAT THAT THERE'S
AN OPENING IN PRODUCE.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.326
SO WHAT'S
YOUR POINT?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.628
ALL THE BIGGIES
STARTED IN PRODUCE--

03:14.695 --> 03:18.332
LOUIE IN FISH, CHUCK IN MEATS,
STELLA IN CHEESE.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.700
GO FOR IT, EDDIE.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.470
REACH FOR THE STARS.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.105
YEAH.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.974
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

03:27.040 --> 03:28.909
HELLO.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.578
DARNELL?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.446
OF COURSE,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.148
CARL'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.118
YOU'RE KIDDING. WHEN?

03:38.185 --> 03:40.421
CARL'S GOING TO BE
SO EXCITED.

03:40.488 --> 03:43.190
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU, TOO.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.659
BYE, DARNELL.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.362
THAT WAS ONE OF CARL'S CLOSEST
FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.063
WAS THAT
DARNELL COLEMAN,

03:50.130 --> 03:53.401
OR DARNELL WATKINS,
OR DARNELL CLARK?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.902
DARNELL CLARK.
UH-HUH.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.571
WERE ALL DAD'S FRIENDS
NAMED DARNELL?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.941
YES. THOSE WERE VERY
CONFUSING TIMES.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.312
CARL'S BEEN
TELLING ME FOR YEARS

04:04.378 --> 04:06.146
WHAT A HOT
SINGING GROUP THEY WERE.

04:06.213 --> 04:09.583
DAD WAS IN
A SINGING GROUP?

04:09.650 --> 04:10.818
YES, HE WAS.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.953
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES
THE DARNELLS.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.189
HI, EVERYBODY.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.325
HELLO.
HI, DAD.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.460
MMM, SOMETHING
SMELLS GOOD.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.695
DAD, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE IN A SINGING GROUP?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.497
WELL, YEAH,
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.065
DID YOU EVER DO A VIDEO?

04:25.132 --> 04:26.400
NO.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.636
DID YOU EVER BURN
YOUR GUITAR ON STAGE?

04:29.803 --> 04:30.938
OF COURSE NOT.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.973
HE WASN'T IN
A SINGING GROUP.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.744
WHY ARE THEY
ASKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

04:36.810 --> 04:40.348
CARL, DARNELL CLARK CALLED
FROM SPRINGFIELD TODAY.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.815
YOU'RE KIDDING.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.752
WHY, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN 20 YEARS. WHAT'S HE UP TO?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.754
WELL, ONE THING
HE'S UP TO IS ORGANIZING

04:46.820 --> 04:49.357
YOUR 20th HIGH SCHOOL
REUNION. IT'S NEXT MONTH.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.059
OH, UH...

04:52.125 --> 04:53.327
I CAN'T MAKE IT.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.430
CARL, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR 20th REUNION.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.599
ALL THE DARNELLS ARE GONNA
BE THERE, ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.868
YEAH, IF YOU LIKE
THAT SORTA THING.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.235
I'M WITH DAD.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.706
ONCE YOU'RE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA GO BACK?

05:05.773 --> 05:09.877
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET TO SAY
THIS MUCH, BUT EDDIE'S RIGHT.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.278
I DON'T GET THIS.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.546
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE DARNELLS

05:12.613 --> 05:14.548
THEY WERE YOUR
BEST FRIENDS.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.785
I KNOW, HARRIET,
BUT REUNIONS ARE...

05:17.851 --> 05:19.019
OVERRATED.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.954
I WENT TO
MY 50th REUNION

05:21.021 --> 05:25.092
AND SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT
DANCING WITH WALTER SIMONS.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.227
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
TWO HIT IT OFF.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.730
WE HAD TO. WE WERE
THE ONLY ONES THERE.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.135
CARL, DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE THE DARNELLS?

05:35.202 --> 05:36.904
YOU WERE SO CLOSE.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.874
HARRIETTE,
THINGS CHANGE. PEOPLE CHANGE.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.412
WELL, THAT'S PART OF THE FUN
TO SEE HOW THEY'VE CHANGED.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.447
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

05:46.514 --> 05:49.216
IT MEANS PEOPLE CHANGE.

05:49.282 --> 05:53.053
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT, HARRIETTE?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.254
SAY WHAT?

05:54.321 --> 05:55.823
THAT I'M FAT!

05:55.889 --> 05:56.824
OKAY, I SAID IT.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.259
AND I'M TOO FAT
TO GO TO MY REUNION.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.229
OH, SO THAT'S IT.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.599
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BECAUSE
YOU'VE PUT ON A FEW POUNDS.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.768
BUT, HARRIETTE, THE DARNELLS
WERE TRACK STARS.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.604
THEY COULD EAT ANYTHING
THEY WANT AND NOT GAIN AN OUNCE.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.873
WE'RE TALKING
METABOLISM HERE, HARRIETTE.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.374
THEY HAVE IT. I DON'T.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.544
IF YOU'RE THAT CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT

06:16.610 --> 06:18.912
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON A DIET?
YOU HAVE A MONTH.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.281
HARRIETTE, I HAVE
TRIED DIET UNDER THE SUN.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.783
AND NEVER
LOST ANY WEIGHT.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.619
I FASTED FOR A WEEK
AND WENT UP A SIZE.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.590
HI.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.424
HI.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.325
WHAT A WORKOUT TONIGHT.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.894
I FEEL GREAT.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.464
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT
THERE'S LEFTOVERS IN THE FRIDGE.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.732
OH, NO THANKS.
I'M TOO PUMPED TO EAT.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.368
I'LL HAVE WATER
WITH A TWIST OF LEMON.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.839
ON SECOND THOUGHT, FORGET THE
LEMON. I'M WATCHING MY WEIGHT.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.914
WHAT?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.817
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

06:56.884 --> 06:59.487
NOT IF YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING
RACHEL INVOLVED IN THIS.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.788
CARL, SHE CAN HELP YOU.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.223
HARRIETTE, IT IS
JUST TOO EMBARRASSING.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.959
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW
WHY I'M NOT GOING TO MY REUNION.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.162
ESPECIALLY NOT "MISS
TOO PUMPED TO EAT."

07:10.798 --> 07:13.867
SO...WHAT DID
YOU GUYS DO TONIGHT?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.537
WE TALKED ABOUT
HOW FAT CARL IS.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.841
THANK YOU, HARRIETTE.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.711
CARL, I WISH YOU'D STOP ACTING
LIKE A BABY, LOSE SOME WEIGHT,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.179
AND GO TO
YOUR CLASS REUNION.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.748
OH, I GET IT.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.551
YOU PUT ON A FEW POUNDS
AND NOW YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.920
WHO, ME?
EMBARRASSED?

07:32.986 --> 07:36.389
I AM NOT EMBARRASSED.
I'M JUST NOT GOING.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.692
LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING, CARL.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.293
IF YOU COULD LOSE
SOME A FEW POUNDS

07:40.360 --> 07:42.462
WOULD YOU GO
TO YOUR REUNION?

07:42.530 --> 07:44.865
MAYBE.
THEN IT'S NO PROBLEM.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.268
I'LL PUT YOU ON MY SPECIAL
PROGRAM OF DIET AND EXERCISE.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.504
I GUARANTEE
YOU'LL LOSE WEIGHT.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.040
REALLY?
YES.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.243
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE COMMITTED TO IT.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.445
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.914
COME ON, CARL, DO IT.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.553
OH, ALRIGHT.
I'LL GO ON A DIET.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.594
HERE YOU GO.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.195
HERE'S THE BUTTER.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.030
GIVE ME THE CHEESE.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.400
HARRIETTE, THIS
DIET IS TORTURE.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.402
I'M DIZZY,
MY VISION'S BLURRED,

08:22.469 --> 08:24.404
AND I'M
SHORT OF BREATH.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.173
CARL, GROW UP.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.841
IT'S ONLY BEEN 12 HOURS.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.245
AH, COULD YOU PASS THE LASAGNE?

08:32.312 --> 08:35.716
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SNEAK
THIS PASS THE JAWS OF LIFE?

08:39.286 --> 08:40.554
DAD!

08:40.621 --> 08:41.889
LET ME JUST BREATHE IN
THE TOMATO SAUCE.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.525
LET ME GET A LITTLE WHIFF.
OKAY.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.163
CARL, YOURS IS ALMOST READY.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.802
SO EDDIE, HOW'D YOU DO IN
THE BIG VEGETABLE INTERVIEW?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.971
YOU KNOW...PRODUCE IS A LOT
HARDER THAN PEOPLE THINK.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.873
FLUNKED, HUH?

08:59.940 --> 09:02.776
I DIDN'T FLUNK.
I ACED THE WRITTEN TEST.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.344
BUT WHEN I WAS
SPRAYING THE LETTUCE

09:04.411 --> 09:06.814
THE HOSE KINDA GOT AWAY FROM ME.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.983
AND AFTER ALL THAT TIME YOU
PRACTICED WITH THE GARDEN HOSE.

09:10.050 --> 09:15.188
YEAH. I SOAKED TWO CUSTOMERS
AND KNOCKED DOWN MR. FUCO MURO.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.826
BUT I STILL GOTTA CHANCE. IT'S
BETWEEN ME AND TWO OTHER GUYS.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.561
THEY'RE BETTER WITH THE HOSE,
BUT I'M THE SMARTEST.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.231
AND THEY FIND THEIR WAY
TO WORK EVERY MORNING.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.901
ALRIGHT, CARL.
HERE'S YOUR DINNER.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.603
NOW, YOU THOUGHT
LASAGNE LOOKED GOOD,

09:29.670 --> 09:33.073
BUT FEAST
YOUR EYES ON THIS.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.745
THAT'S IT?
THREE STALKS OF ASPARAGUS

09:37.811 --> 09:39.680
AND SOME
STEAMED BROCCOLI?

09:39.747 --> 09:40.948
RACHEL, I'VE HAD
MORE FOOD THAN THIS

09:41.014 --> 09:42.683
STUCK
BETWEEN MY TEETH.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.097
WHAT THE....

10:05.839 --> 10:07.507
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.210
MY OWN FAMILY
DOESN'T TRUST ME.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.382
"DEAR CARL, HAVE A GLASS
OF WATER AND GO TO BED."

10:17.651 --> 10:19.352
GET OUT OF HERE.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.557
MY CANDY STASH!

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
YEAH.

10:37.204 --> 10:41.341
"DEAR CARL, NICE TRY.
NOW GO TO BED."

10:41.408 --> 10:43.844
FOOD! I NEED FOOD!

10:46.179 --> 10:49.349
SALT, PEPPER,
TOOTHPICKS, BABY FOOD,

10:49.416 --> 10:51.151
COOKING OIL, CORN STAR--

10:51.218 --> 10:52.352
BABY FOOD!

10:54.788 --> 10:56.890
STRAINED SPAGHETTI
AND MEATBALLS.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.392
YEAH.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.542
SHH!

11:15.608 --> 11:18.378
CARL, IS THAT YOU?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.738
CARL, BABY FOOD?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.674
THAT'S PATHETIC!

11:47.741 --> 11:50.110
HAND IT OVER.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.640
WANT THE REST
OF MY CUPCAKE?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.343
NO. THREE'S MY LIMIT.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.012
LOOKING GOOD.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.213
THANKS.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.703
GOSH, DAD, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO LEAVE THESE HERE.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.905
LEAVE WHAT?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.540
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.116
OKAY, 15 MINUTES.
YOU'RE FINISHED.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.384
HALLELUJAH!

13:05.452 --> 13:08.055
OH, CARL,
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.390
I MEAN, YOU'VE STUCK TO THE
RACHEL METHOD FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.294
AND NOW, IT'S TIME
TO KICK IT INTO HIGH GEAR.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.463
DROP AND GIVE ME 50!

13:35.548 --> 13:36.816
HI.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.118
SO, EDDIE,
WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.987
DID YOU SKYROCKET
TO PRODUCE?

13:40.053 --> 13:42.822
I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL YOU...

13:42.890 --> 13:44.091
I'M GONNA YOU.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.666
OH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.103
SO HOW ARE
YOUR TOMATOES?

13:57.104 --> 14:00.107
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.977
HEY, DAD,
GOT THE JOB.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.678
OH, I CAN SEE.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.846
CONGRATULATIONS, SON.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.249
SO HOW ARE YOUR TOMATOES?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.885
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
KEEP ASKING ME THAT?

14:13.653 --> 14:17.157
WE'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
AFTER YOUR FATHER'S WEIGH-IN.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.894
COME ON, CARL, LET'S SEE
HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU'VE LOST.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.896
ARE YOU SURE
THAT THING WORKS RIGHT?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.464
I CAN CHECK IT FOR YOU.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.967
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH I WEIGH
FROM MY LAST PHYSICAL.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.936
THEY WEIGHED ME
AT MY LAST PHYSICAL.

14:29.002 --> 14:29.769
WHEN WAS THAT?

14:29.836 --> 14:31.171
1947.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.508
YEP, RIGHT ON THE BUTTON.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.846
YOUR TURN.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.715
OH, THIS IS DUMB. I HAVEN'T LOST
ANY WEIGHT. I JUST KNOW IT.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.017
HEADS. OH, COME ON, CARL.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.653
HOW'S THIS--WE'LL
ALL TURN OUR HEADS.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.820
NOBODY WILL LOOK.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.991
THIS WILL BE YOUR
OWN PRIVATE MOMENT.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.260
WELL, THAT SOUNDS OKAY.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.975
IT WORKED!
I LOST 11 POUNDS!

15:11.178 --> 15:13.713
WAY TO GO, SON.
ALRIGHT, DAD!

15:13.780 --> 15:16.383
NOW, CARL, DOES THIS
MEAN WE CAN GO TO THE REUNION?

15:16.449 --> 15:17.184
YOU BET.
GOOD.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.318
I'LL CALL DARNELL AND TELL 'EM

15:18.385 --> 15:19.486
YOU'RE GONNA
BE SINGING WITH THEM.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.955
SINGING? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:22.022 --> 15:25.392
DARNELL CALLED THIS MORNING
AND OF YOU ARE GONNA BE SINGING
THE THE REUNION.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.561
ON STAGE? IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.264
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.433
IT WAS ONE THING WHEN I
WAS JUST GONNA MINGLE.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.502
BUT NOW I'M GONNA BE
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.071
FORGET THAT. I'M NOT GOING
TO THE REUNION.

15:53.286 --> 15:57.290
YOU EAT THAT, AND YOU CAN
KISS YOUR DIET GOODBYE.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.626
GOODBYE.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.061
HARRIETTE, WOULD YOU
HAND ME THE HOT FUDGE

16:01.128 --> 16:03.430
ON THE STOVE OVER THERE, PLEASE?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.932
HONEY, THERE IS JUST
TOO MUCH EMPHASIS IN OUR CULTURE

16:05.999 --> 16:07.867
THESE DAYS
ON BEING THIN.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.336
I MEAN, EVERYWHERE
YOU LOOK--

16:09.402 --> 16:12.272
IN TV, MOVIES,
MAGAZINES.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.174
ALL THESE
90-POUND PEOPLE

16:14.241 --> 16:17.944
WALKING AROUND
SMILING AND DANCING.

16:18.011 --> 16:21.748
WHERE DO THEY
GET THE STRENGTH?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.250
BEATS ME.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.152
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
BEEN WHAT YOU COULD CALL THIN.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.954
I MEAN, AS A BABY,
I WAS CHUBBY,

16:28.021 --> 16:29.522
AS A KID,
I WAS HUSKY,

16:29.589 --> 16:33.460
AND NOW AS AN ADULT,
I'M...BIG-BONED.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.695
BUT FOR AS LONG AS
I CAN REMEMBER,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.398
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN HAPPY.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.966
CARL...

16:40.033 --> 16:42.235
IF YOU'RE HAPPY,
THEN WHY ARE YOU WORRIED

16:42.302 --> 16:45.072
ABOUT WHAT THE PEOPLE AT
THE REUNION ARE GONNA THINK?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.674
WELL, IT'S NOT EVERYBODY
THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.509
IT'S JUST THE DARNELLS.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.644
CARL, THE DARNELLS
ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.048
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS WHO YOU
ARE AND HOW YOU'RE DOING.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.484
NOT IF YOU'VE PICKED UP
A FEW EXTRA POUNDS.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.221
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

17:01.288 --> 17:04.457
IF THEY'RE YOUR
FRIENDS, I KNOW SO.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.994
OKAY, I'LL PASS
ON THE SUNDAE.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.562
BESIDES,
I WANT TO BE SURE

17:09.629 --> 17:12.765
I FIT INTO MY SUIT
FOR THE REUNION.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.101
GOOD FOR YOU, CARL.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.738
AND ANYWAY YOU'RE
THE ONLY SUGAR I NEED.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.034
HI.

17:48.101 --> 17:52.139
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE WINSLOW.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.174
MISS GILBERT.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.075
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER HANDED IN

17:56.143 --> 17:58.845
THAT BOOK REPORT
ON SILAS MARNER.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.648
OH, UH...
MY DOG ATE IT.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.453
THE SAME OLD WINSLOW.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.622
THANK YOU.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.890
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FIVE MINUTES,

18:10.957 --> 18:13.493
AND ALREADY
I'VE GOT HOMEWORK.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.063
CARL WINSLOW, RIGHT?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.132
RIGHT. AND YOU'RE...

18:19.199 --> 18:20.900
RUSSELL.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.435
RUSSELL WILCOX.

18:22.502 --> 18:26.206
YOU SAT BEHIND ME
IN HOMEROOM.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.440
THIS IS MY WIFE,
HARRIETTE.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.342
HI.
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

18:29.409 --> 18:32.011
AND THIS IS MY
LITTLE WOMAN, REMEMBER?

18:32.078 --> 18:34.281
DON'T "LITTLE WOMAN"
ME, RUSSELL.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.249
QUIT BLOWING ONE NOTE, IRENE.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.550
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
YOUR MOTHER.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.920
OH, YEAH, WELL, HOW'S THIS--
I WANT A DIVORCE!

18:40.987 --> 18:43.089
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.558
GOOD!
I'LL BE AT THE BAR.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.463
NICE SEEING YOU
AGAIN, CARL.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.931
NICE MEETING YOU,
HARRIETTE.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.333
YOU TOO.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.370
WHO WAS
THAT FUN COUPLE?

18:57.437 --> 19:01.741
RUSSELL AND IRENE WERE VOTED
CLASS ROMEO AND JULIET.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.142
CARL?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.947
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

19:08.014 --> 19:10.450
GOSH, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.653
OH, AND YOU MUST BE
HARRIETTE.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.987
YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.323
THANK YOU.

19:16.389 --> 19:20.527
WHAT'S HAS IT BEEN,
20 YEARS? AT LEAST.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.828
WHO ARE YOU?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.332
WHO AM I?

19:25.398 --> 19:28.935
* DOO DOO WAH *

19:29.001 --> 19:31.671
DARNELL! HARRIETTE,
IT'S DARNELL!

19:32.972 --> 19:35.442
MAN, LOOK AT YOU!

19:35.508 --> 19:37.210
AW, CARL,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.611
SO DO YOU.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.748
OH, WELL, THANK YOU,
BUT I HAVE PUT ON A FEW POUNDS.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.252
MOSTLY IN THE ARMS
AND SHOULDERS, THOUGH.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.255
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY WIFE. JANET?

19:48.321 --> 19:51.258
JANET, MEET HARRIETTE
AND CARL WINSLOW.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.594
OH, CARL, I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.763
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT DARNELL.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.998
IT'S NICE
TO FINALLY MEET BOTH OF YOU.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.100
YOU KNOW WHEN DARNELL HEARD
ABOUT THE REUNION.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.535
HE DIDN'T WANNA COME.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.937
HE WAS EMBARRASSED
ABOUT HIS WEIGHT.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.673
JANET, PUT ME
ON A DIET.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.876
I HAVE LOST THREE
WHOLE POUNDS.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.312
DOESN'T HE LOOK GREAT?

20:12.379 --> 20:15.682
YEAH! I DIDN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE HIM.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.484
CARL!

20:17.550 --> 20:18.985
IT'S DARNELL AND DARNELL.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.555
GO EASY ON THEM.
THEY'VE KINDA LET THEMSELVES GO.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.192
CARL!

20:26.259 --> 20:27.226
DARNELL!

20:27.294 --> 20:28.495
DARNELL!

20:28.561 --> 20:29.161
DARNELL!

20:29.228 --> 20:30.997

20:31.063 --> 20:32.365
DARNELL!

20:33.333 --> 20:35.067

HEY, MAN.

LOOK AT YOU, MAN.

20:41.408 --> 20:45.345
LOOK AT YOU, MAN.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.913
AND YOU MUST BE
HARRIETTE.

20:46.979 --> 20:51.117
WELL, IF IT'S EASIER FOR YOU,
YOU CAN CALL ME DARNELL.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.919
MAN, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.721
HE'S PRACTICALLY
INVISIBLE.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.624
HE'S SO SKINNY,
HE COULD BE AN X-RAY.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.760
HEY, BROTHER, HOW YOU WEIGH
YOURSELF-- ON A POSTAGE SCALE?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.898
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THESE GUYS WERE FUN GUYS?

21:05.965 --> 21:08.368
LISTEN, GUYS,
YOU THINK WE COULD FIND

21:08.435 --> 21:09.769
AN EMPTY CLASSROOM
TO REHEARSE OUR SONG?

21:09.836 --> 21:13.005
YEAH. BUT LISTEN, CAN WE GET
SOMETHING TO EAT FIRST?

21:13.072 --> 21:14.874
HEY, YOU READ MY MIND.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.311
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.713
HARRIETTE, THANK YOU.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.581
I LOVE YOU.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.651
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
SKINNY.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.921
DARNELL, LOOK, WAIT UP.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.928
YOU BROKE MY HEART

21:35.995 --> 21:38.398
BECAUSE I COULDN'T DANCE.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.933
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
WANT ME AROUND.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.103
BUT, BABY,

21:44.170 --> 21:45.271
