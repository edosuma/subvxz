00:00.126 --> 00:01.961
<i>Previously on</i> Bosch Legacy...

00:02.336 --> 00:06.424
<i>Rogers had some
really unsavory actors in the mix.</i>

00:06.424 --> 00:08.175
<i>Unsavory in what way?</i>

00:08.259 --> 00:09.885
<i>In the Bratva way.</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:11.887
<i>Our Stoli friend wants to meet.</i>

00:11.971 --> 00:12.972
Can you buy us some time?

00:12.972 --> 00:14.557
<i>They sound impatient, Carl.</i>

00:14.557 --> 00:16.642
- <i>"They"?</i>
- <i>The old man sent love.</i>

00:16.892 --> 00:19.478
<i>Rogers just got on the phone
with a dude named Simon.</i>

00:19.562 --> 00:20.604
<i>They're setting up a meeting.</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:22.648
Simon Wakefield is his financial guy.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.400
Yeah, well,
they ain't dealing with no bank.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.902
This sounded urgent
and Rogers sounded concerned.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.613
- Mr. Datz, you're under arrest.
- Fuck!

00:29.697 --> 00:31.282
What can I do for you, Mr. Vance?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.909
I was hoping you could bring
an old man some peace

00:33.993 --> 00:34.910
and redemption.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.829
There's billions at stake here...

00:37.538 --> 00:40.291
and people will do anything to stop you.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.668
Why the fuck we hire
a private investigator?

00:42.752 --> 00:44.253
The man's 88 years old, for Christ's sake.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.629
As soon as the old man croaks,

00:45.713 --> 00:48.632
long lost children of Whitney Vance
will crawl out of the woodwork.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.675
Meantime...

00:50.217 --> 00:51.719
my people are on Bosch.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.845
What's this about?

00:52.845 --> 00:53.888
St. Helens.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.681
I was there for 50 years.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.142
There were hundreds of babies.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.685
I think you'd remember the name.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.062
Vibiana.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.689
She got time with that baby.

01:03.773 --> 01:05.608
No one else ever got with theirs.

01:05.608 --> 01:06.817
You remember his name?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.402
<i>Vibi called him Dominick.</i>

01:08.486 --> 01:09.403
DOMINICK - MALE - SINGLE
OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

01:10.029 --> 01:11.572
"Dominick Santanello."

02:43.831 --> 02:46.166
LEGACY

02:58.721 --> 03:00.306
He has no reason to talk to us.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.392
I suppose not, but still have to try.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.812
Check it off the list.
Just back my play, okay?

03:06.896 --> 03:07.897
You got lt.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.108
By the way, nice job on Herstadt.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.234
Thank you.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.153
The DNA transfer.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.779
Very smart.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.197
I thought so.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.034
Guess there was a chance
he was innocent after all.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.370
- Is that an apology?
- For what?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.123
Fuck you, Bosch.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.833
You're welcome.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.376
FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION NEXT EXIT

03:34.048 --> 03:36.133
The Dynamic fucking Duo.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.094
Lady lawyer and her bloodhound.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.097
What'd I do to deserve this?

03:42.181 --> 03:45.100
Willy Datz, it's your lucky day.

03:47.686 --> 03:48.896
Aren't you curious?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.564
Fuck it.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.691
Beats sitting in my cell.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.028
Okay, so talk.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.364
We know Rogers got to you.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.908
You don't know shit.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.790
Recognize him?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.917
Can't say that I do.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.086
A client of mine. Raúl Arraya.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.879
Means nothing to me.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.965
He's a shot caller. Eme.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.175
Can tell that from the tattoos.

04:19.051 --> 04:23.681
Fancy lady lawyer like you
representing a piece a shit like that?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.307
Shame on you.

04:26.517 --> 04:30.854
Mr. Arraya is currently
incarcerated here at Terminal Island.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.982
D-block, same as you.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.566
What a coincidence.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.820
One of these days,
his boys are bound to pay you a visit.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.488
Why would they do that?

04:39.488 --> 04:41.532
Raúl owes me a favor.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.707
You can't do that.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.960
- You can't just...
- Oh, I wouldn't.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.837
But, um...

04:55.546 --> 04:57.548
Raúl has a mind of his own.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.177
You're a fucking attorney,
for Christ's sake.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.137
It's against the law.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.638
So is murder for hire.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.891
Now I could put in a word.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.060
Intercede. Or not.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.520
Up to you.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.063
Who was it?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.481
Who reached out to you?

05:20.988 --> 05:24.825
I tell you, hand to God,
you swear to keep it between us.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.784
"Hand to God."

05:25.868 --> 05:26.827
I trust you?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.454
You got no other choice.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.958
Fuck me.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.881
One day I get a visitor.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.716
An attorney.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.384
Never seen him before.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.344
He says, "Change your story,

05:44.428 --> 05:46.055
let Rogers off the hook,

05:46.055 --> 05:48.098
and we'll take care of your family."

05:49.183 --> 05:50.893
I say, "What if I don't?"

05:52.394 --> 05:54.271
He says, "Like I said.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.190
We'll take care of your family."

05:57.483 --> 05:58.901
Who did he represent?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.945
Russians. Serious assholes.

06:02.029 --> 06:02.905
Bratva?

06:02.905 --> 06:07.117
No, the fucking Bolshoi Ballet.
Yes, Bratva.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.285
Names?

06:08.577 --> 06:11.914
Only one. Alex Ivanovich.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.207
They say why?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.125
Why they wanted Rogers to skate?

06:15.209 --> 06:18.128
They didn't say, and I didn't ask.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.756
I just said "Da."

06:21.173 --> 06:22.549
I never would've have pegged you

06:22.633 --> 06:24.551
as a lawyer for the Mexican Mafia.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.804
Everyone needs representation.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.889
- Pro bono?
- Hardly.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.475
Arraya's doing life without parole.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.102
How could he owe you one?

06:33.102 --> 06:34.645
You get him spared the needle?

06:34.645 --> 06:37.439
I wasn't part of his
criminal defense team.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.192
I represented him
in a subsequent civil rights case.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.569
Ah, there's the Honey Chandler I know.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.073
Civil rights for scumbags
with deep pockets.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.741
Yeah, Raúl has Type One diabetes,

06:47.825 --> 06:51.703
which was left untreated
by the prison authorities at Victorville.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.081
He went into a coma and almost died.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.666
Eighth Amendment violation.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.584
Oh, so you have read the Constitution.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.169
Bet your ass. Cover to cover.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.172
The Feds opted to settle
rather than take it to trial.

07:02.256 --> 07:06.051
I got Raúl transferred to a lower
security facility with better healthcare.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.344
Terminal Island.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.472
Which gave me the idea,
how to leverage Datz.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.766
Oh, by the way. "Hand to God"?

07:13.308 --> 07:15.227
I'm a card-carrying atheist.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.856
By the way, that bluff, it's world class.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.858
What makes you think I was bluffing?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.121
- Hey, Bosch.
- Perez.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.414
Just starting your shift?

07:35.414 --> 07:37.916
Yeah, obviously. Done for the day?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.085
Obviously. And I got a day off tomorrow.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.879
Nice. You have any plans?

07:41.879 --> 07:45.174
Nah, I'm free. You wanna have lunch?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.968
I'm... I'm not...
I wasn't asking you

07:47.968 --> 07:50.387
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were...
- ...on a date or anything.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.598
I was just making small talk.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.474
My bad.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.103
- I gotta go, my T.O. ...
- Sure, sure.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.732
Listen. We're grabbing a drink
some night this week.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.401
Boots only. Casual. No big thing. You in?

08:05.068 --> 08:05.986
We'll see.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.696
Okay. Later.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.873
Excuse me. How'd it go?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.417
Better than expected.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.336
- Datz fessed up?
- He did.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.171
That surprises me.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.298
Well, he had a change of heart.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.342
Hmm. What prompted that?

08:29.092 --> 08:31.595
- I persuaded him.
- How?

08:32.262 --> 08:33.805
Hm. Painted the big picture.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.266
You know, laid out
the pros and cons so to speak.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.894
You didn't answer my question.

08:39.645 --> 08:43.440
I informed him
that one of his fellow inmates

08:43.440 --> 08:45.317
is an old client of mine.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.611
And this old client of yours?

08:48.237 --> 08:49.446
Raúl Arraya.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.697
You threatened him.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.324
I did not.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.620
I pointed out that sooner or later,
their paths were bound to cross.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.082
And as someone who has done me
great bodily harm in the past,

09:00.082 --> 09:04.294
it might behoove him to avail himself
of my intercession,

09:04.378 --> 09:05.671
vis a vis Raúl.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.172
Sounds like a threat to me.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.091
Martin, I offered him a choice.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.551
I could intervene on his behalf,

09:11.635 --> 09:15.264
in exchange for some useful,
if off the record, information.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.182
Or not,

09:17.266 --> 09:19.601
and he could roll the dice
and take his chances.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.437
I think he made the right choice.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.606
It's a fine line you're walking.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.024
I think I'm on the right side of it.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.237
And Arraya? Will he let Datz be?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.488
Probably.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.907
He likes me, and he does owe me.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.618
On the other hand,

09:36.702 --> 09:38.620
you never know with sociopaths.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.624
Joke, Martin.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.335
It was a joke.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.337
I worry about you.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.610
"Dominick Santanello".

10:11.862 --> 10:13.155
Dominick with a "C-K"

10:13.155 --> 10:15.907
Oh, adding a 'k'. Uh, date of birth?

10:15.991 --> 10:17.951
January 31st, 1953.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.786

All right, California Driver's License

10:27.085 --> 10:28.003
SANTANELLO, DOMINICK

10:28.003 --> 10:29.254
His 16th birthday.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.173
When did he last renew it?

10:31.173 --> 10:33.425
Mm, looks like never.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.344
What do you mean, "never"?

10:35.344 --> 10:36.511
He never renewed it.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.057
Maybe he moved out of the state.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.685
GOOGLE
DOMINICK SANTANELLO

10:44.728 --> 10:47.981
Mm, handful of guys with that spelling.
None the right age.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.275
Wait a minute, is that all you did?

10:50.359 --> 10:52.402
You just switch to another search engine?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.112
Yeah, it's called Google.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.657
Remind me why I need your services.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.993
Well, maybe he quit driving.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.664
Maybe he died young.
Never had a chance to renew his license.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.958
Damn, that's morbid.
Why you gotta go there?

11:07.042 --> 11:08.210
Educated guess.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.796
Like a car accident? Teenage driver?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.092
Teenage soldier.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.928
He's sixteen in 1969.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.722
Couple years later,
Vietnam's still on fire.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.517
He's old enough to enlist,
eligible for the draft.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.560
And gets sent to 'Nam.

11:26.144 --> 11:30.899
Pull up Vietnam War Memorial,
Wall of Faces, Dominick Santanello.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.961
A month and change shy
of his twentieth birthday.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.506
Um, K-I-A?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.634
Killed in action.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.302
Oh.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.807
So why are you looking for
this guy anyway? Who is he?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.809
Just another teenage soldier

12:05.809 --> 12:07.477
who never made it home.

DEAR DOMINICK SANTANELLO,
YOUR SERVICE WILL BE REMEMBERED

12:53.190 --> 12:54.983
BEYOND YOUR DAYS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.529
DON'T FEEL SO BAD, BILL.
WE ALL KNEW NICK

12:59.613 --> 13:01.072
AND HOW HEADSTRONG HE WAS
AND HOW HE WANTED ADVENTURE.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.912
IT'S BEEN ALMOST 45 YEARS SINCE
YOU'VE LEFT US. LOVE YOU, OLIVIA.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.538
MISS YOU EVERYDAY AND CELEBRATE
YOU TODAY. LOVE, OLIVIA

13:18.924 --> 13:20.967
OLIVIA, I HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT NICK.
CALL ME. 323-244-5631 HARRY

13:21.051 --> 13:22.219
NICK, WE MISS YOU AND THINK
ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.762
ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS. LOVE, OLIVIA.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.227
Message in a bottle.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.189
This is so good.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.942
I know, right? So fatty, so fried,
so good.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.527
That was such a good idea.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.653
TREJO'S COFFEE AND DONUTS

13:39.653 --> 13:41.571
What'd you call that shade of pink?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.240
I dunno. Fuchsia?

13:43.949 --> 13:44.866
Bubblegum.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.909
Bubblegum's pinker.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.994
Pepto Bismol.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.080
You like his movies?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.415
I've never seen one.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.961
- Girl, you kidding me?
- I don't think so.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.464
<i>Machete. Desperado. Dusk Till Dawn?</i>

13:59.548 --> 14:02.092
Nope. <i>-</i> You should check 'em out.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.513
You went to college, right?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.557
- Chapman.
- Where's that?

14:08.557 --> 14:10.475
- Orange County.
- Mm.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.852
- You?
- Cal State Northridge.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.479
Is that in Northridge?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.274
Funny.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.279
So, why a cop?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.782
Is this a test?

14:25.782 --> 14:28.702
Like, who's real police?

14:29.828 --> 14:32.289
First, donuts and then the third degree?

14:32.289 --> 14:34.332
You don't seem like a typical cop is all.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.459
Well, what's a typical cop seem like?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.212
More like me. No offense.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.505
No, I get it.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.050
I know your dad was a cop.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.428
My dad and my mom.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.680
- Your mom was a cop, too?
- FBI agent.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.892
Whoa. Holy shit. That's like serious DNA.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.394
Runs in the family.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.896
I guess.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.774
You wanted to be one of the good guys.
Like mom and dad?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.985
- That's corny, right?
- Totally corny.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.446
I respect that.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.907
Why'd you become a cop?

15:10.327 --> 15:11.661
The overtime.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.541
Law enforcement.
Gateway to the middle-class.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.462
I can't tell if you're kidding.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.298
<i>Hollywood units and 6 Adam 79,</i>

<i>No suspect description.</i>

15:28.887 --> 15:34.184
<i>6 A 79 handle Code 3.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.064
Responding Code 3 from

This is why...

15:45.028 --> 15:45.987
VANCE MANSION

15:46.071 --> 15:47.364
- <i>Mr. Bosch?
- </i> I'm here.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.948
<i>Standby for Mr. Vance.</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:54.204
<i>Mr. Bosch?</i>

15:54.704 --> 15:57.624
Mr. Vance, I have some
information for you.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.751
<i>Not on the phone.
Someone may be listening.</i>

15:59.751 --> 16:01.503
<i>Do you know where Valhalla is?</i>

16:01.503 --> 16:02.587
Burbank.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.839
<i>I will meet you there in one hour.</i>

16:04.923 --> 16:06.132
<i>Don't be late.</i>

16:09.511 --> 16:12.389
<i>I went out early to run some errands.</i>

16:12.389 --> 16:17.644
I got home, he was
in the bedroom waiting for me.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.104
He had a knife.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.776
He told me not to... to scream.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.322
It's okay. Just... take your time.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.867
I told him had my period.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.745
He knew I was lying.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.247
What'd he look like?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.748
Can you describe him?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.875
He was wearing a mask.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.504
Black, White, Asian, Latino?
Could you tell us?

16:45.547 --> 16:48.299
White. I could see his hands.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.218
What about the mask?

16:50.760 --> 16:54.764
It was one of those
Mexican wrestling masks.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.558
Covered his whole head and face.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.351
- Color?
- Red.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.645
Red and black, maybe.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.732
Was he tall, short?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.151
Average.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.612
What about weight? Heavy? Thin?

17:09.696 --> 17:13.074
Sorry, uh, average?

17:14.743 --> 17:16.619
Anything else that you can recall?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.621
Any little detail could be helpful.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.292
His breath was terrible,

17:22.292 --> 17:24.419
and he smelled of cigarettes.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.554
So where you going you need a clean ride?

17:34.554 --> 17:37.474
Confidential. You really trust that gizmo?

17:37.474 --> 17:39.184
Man, this shit's state of the art,

17:39.184 --> 17:40.894
top of the line. Worth every penny.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.564
This bad boy'll pick up digital
<i>and</i> analog transmissions.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.941
I'm used to losing a tail
the old-fashioned way.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.985
Bootleg turns and reverse 180s.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.528
Old school.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.906
Grad school. You almost done?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.282
Car's clean.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.540
Hey, uh, Rogers is on the move.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.543
Let me know he heads
downtown to Wall Street.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.961
Later.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.338
Later.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.974
- Where the hell is the detective?
- Westside traffic.

18:20.725 --> 18:21.684
Finish your canvass?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.145
Only one person home at the time.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.897
Um, an older lady on the second floor,

18:25.897 --> 18:27.607
and she didn't see or hear anything.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.068
I'm gonna stay with the vic
till the detective arrives.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.486
'Case she remembers something else.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.737
You look for a point of entry,

18:32.821 --> 18:34.656
secure any evidence till the crims arrive.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.671
PORTAL OF THE FOLDED WINDS

19:47.896 --> 19:48.980
Mr. Vance.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.982
Peaceful, isn't it?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.527
My father's buried here, Mr. Bosch.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.406
I'll be buried here, too. Soon, very soon.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.826
See that plaque?

20:01.910 --> 20:03.870
That's in honor of my father.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.288
NELSON VANCE
VISIONARY AIR PIONEER

20:05.288 --> 20:06.372
EARLIEST ADVOCATE OF U.S. AIR POWER

20:06.456 --> 20:08.374
Sings his praises. A visionary. Pioneer.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.878
He made more money than
he could spend in ten lifetimes.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.005
None of that matters in the end.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.050
You end up in the ground
like everybody else.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.552
- You don't believe that.
- Don't I?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.137
Legacy matters.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.307
How you live your life,
what you leave behind.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.018
Why you hired me. Find your heir.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.521
Do you have something to tell me,
Mr. Bosch?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.445
You had a son.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.660
He has his mother's eyes.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.036
THE WALL OF FACES
DOMINICK SANTANELLO

20:45.036 --> 20:46.955
His name was Dominick Santanello.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.000
Speaking in the past tense.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.421
He was a medic. Died in Vietnam.

20:55.505 --> 20:59.384
Just short of his 20th birthday.
December 9th, 1972.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.058
So much for my legacy.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.062
What else you know about him?

21:11.062 --> 21:12.814
He was stationed in Da Nang.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.400
He was killed in action
in Tay Ninh Province.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.110
And?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.821
I'm sorry. That's all I know.

21:19.821 --> 21:23.866
You found my son. I thank you for that.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.329
I wonder.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.626
If I had stood up to
my father all those years ago.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.338
The path not taken.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.342
Tell me, Mr. Bosch,
were you close to your father?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.137
I never knew my father.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.972
So that's what you meant.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.473
Sorry?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.726
When you said you knew what it felt like.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.146
Right.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.606
Thank you, Mr. Bosch, for your effort.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.942
You're welcome.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.902
I'd like to know more about him.

22:00.570 --> 22:01.571
Sir?

22:01.571 --> 22:04.282
Whatever you can find out about my son.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.326
Humor me.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.340
THE WALL OF FACES
DOMINICK SANTANELLO

23:38.584 --> 23:40.086
Point of entry's clear.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.630
Cut the screen,
came in through the window.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.840
Yup.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.801
- Victim said he had a knife.
- No knife was recovered.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.469
You searched the perimeter thoroughly?

23:48.553 --> 23:49.929
I did, yes.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.099
There's also a used tissue
in the wastebasket in the bedroom.

23:56.269 --> 23:59.689
The victim needs to be taken to Santa
Monica Hospital for her SART exam.

23:59.689 --> 24:00.857
I'll bring her out.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.694
- Stay in my lane?
- Exactly.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.545
- What you got?
- <i>Rogers is headed downtown.</i>

24:22.545 --> 24:23.921
Okay, keep in touch.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.300
- Yeah.
- <i>You see him?</i>

25:09.300 --> 25:11.177
I see his car. Not him.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.367
SOKOL INC 302

25:51.968 --> 25:55.179
I have your money.
Your original investment. Every penny.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.682
You assured us double our money.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.601
That was before the unfortunate events
of the last year.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.937
Your problem, not ours.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.106
We invest with you ten million.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.984
It's gonna take us a little time
to get another ten together.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.193
Another thirty.

26:09.694 --> 26:10.945
I don't understand.

26:10.945 --> 26:14.573
Is now forty. Original ten, plus.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.034
- Interest.
- This wasn't a loan.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.536
This was a buy- in.

26:18.536 --> 26:21.247
Ten. Plus interest. Is forty.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.082
Call it what you want.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.917
You have diverse portfolio.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.295
All different kinds of irons in fire.

26:27.295 --> 26:29.422
You have to understand.

26:29.422 --> 26:32.425
My businesses all took a hit
when I was inside.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.594
We won't fucking haggle with you.
Understand?

26:36.345 --> 26:37.930
Clock is ticking.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.099
Tick fucking tock.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.476
Alex, be reasonable.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.603
I don't have that kind of cash on hand.

26:44.729 --> 26:47.523
I'm sorry to hear that, Carl.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.547
Wake up.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.132
Let's go for a walk.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.319
I'm gonna to need a little time.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.904
That's what they all say.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.947
- Who say?
- Deadbeats.

27:37.031 --> 27:40.951
Ah, true. That is what they say.

27:41.035 --> 27:44.413
- To ramp up production...
- You have one week to get started.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.748
I need more time.

27:45.748 --> 27:46.957
I don't know what else to tell you.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.960
You tell us "Can do."

27:50.044 --> 27:52.838
You ramp up production.
You tap another line.

27:54.632 --> 27:57.343
You see, it's not that simple.

27:58.386 --> 28:01.889
If we ramp up production too fast,
we blow the whole operation.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.017
We've been able to fly under the radar
because we haven't been greedy.

28:05.142 --> 28:09.438
If we start tapping new lines now,
peopled are bound to notice.

28:09.522 --> 28:13.442
Slow and steady wins the race.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.569
Fuck that.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.865
- It is problem you cannot handle?
- No, no.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.034
We'll figure it out.

28:22.118 --> 28:25.955
Carl, I really have to urge caution here.
This is not a good idea.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.417
Shut up, Simon. Shut. Up.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.462
We'll get you your money.

28:58.529 --> 28:59.572
SECURITY

28:59.572 --> 29:02.074
You have an uninvited guest.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.160
Where is he now?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.578
Outside your door.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.956
Go downstairs. Secure the exits.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.291
Don't let him get away.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.459
Understood.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.133
Hey!

29:41.614 --> 29:42.698
Get up!

30:07.223 --> 30:08.098
He's on the roof!

30:21.612 --> 30:22.613
He's on the stairs!

31:03.070 --> 31:04.321
This way! Come on!

32:24.318 --> 32:26.320
- Who is it?
- It's me.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.155
Hey, honey. It's open, come on in.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.744
Oh, shit, I'm sorry, let me help you.

32:33.744 --> 32:34.953
I got it.

32:37.498 --> 32:38.749
Oh.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.419
Fantastic. I've been meaning
to get up to the house.

32:42.503 --> 32:45.714
I couldn't get all of them,
but I got your faves.

32:45.798 --> 32:49.259
Frank Morgan, Art Pepper, Ron Carter...

32:49.343 --> 32:52.054
Honey, you're the best, thank you so much.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.806
Now if only I had something
to play them on.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.265
Stereo's in the car.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.101
Aw, I was hoping you'd say that.

32:57.935 --> 33:00.688
- Day off?
- No, I'm on my way into work.

33:00.688 --> 33:03.315
I like what
you've done with the place.

33:03.399 --> 33:04.733
Thanks.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.569
- I was being sarcastic.
- So was I.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.447
When you gonna get
a good pull-out sofa bed?

33:11.240 --> 33:12.616
Not gonna be here that long.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.992
It's bad for your back.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.245
Where's Coltrane?

33:16.245 --> 33:17.830
He's out with Sam.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.373
Is that why you left
all the doors unlocked?

33:19.373 --> 33:21.166
- As a matter of fact.
- What, does she not have a key?

33:21.250 --> 33:23.168
She does, Officer Friendly.

33:23.252 --> 33:26.880
Sorry.
Sorry, I just... worry about you.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.049
Welcome to my world. I worry about you.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.552
Out on the mean streets of East Hollywood.

33:31.552 --> 33:34.388
They can be. What are you working on?

33:34.388 --> 33:37.349
Nothing dangerous. Paper trail.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.476
So how's it going?

33:40.269 --> 33:41.520
It's going well.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.608
I'll tell you about it over dinner.
You free Friday?

33:46.692 --> 33:48.318
Pretty much always.

33:48.402 --> 33:51.780
My schedule is a <i>tabula rasa.</i>
That means...

33:51.864 --> 33:55.909
Uh, I know what it means.
It's actually <i>tab-ula rasa.</i>

33:55.993 --> 33:57.536
Oh, right.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.330
- So are we on?
- Friday dinner.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.793
Well, I'd like to stay around
and say hi to Coltrane,

34:04.877 --> 34:05.919
but I gotta get going.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.380
They're gonna be back in a minute.
Let's just go get the stereo.

34:08.464 --> 34:09.298
Okay.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.884
She really is so good with him.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.802
Who, Sam? She's a gem.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.472
Coltrane? Loves her.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.890
Jealous.

34:17.890 --> 34:21.018
Well, you come around more often.
He won't forget you.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.394
Yeah, never happen.

34:25.314 --> 34:27.274
These are the guys chased you
through the garment district?

34:27.274 --> 34:29.151
Tried to turn me into a piñata.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.488
Alexei and Lev Ivanovich.
They're actual brothers.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.073
- Bratva?
- Bratva royalty.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.868
Boys are gangster princelings.
Papa's legendary.

34:37.868 --> 34:38.994
A big <i>macher.</i>

34:39.828 --> 34:41.497
Tell me about Junior.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.000
Did a few years in the gulag for murder.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.293
Story goes he actually buried alive

34:46.293 --> 34:49.338
some other <i>kriminal</i>
who owed the old man money.

34:49.338 --> 34:52.758
- True story?
- Could be apocryphal. Or not.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.802
Certainly capable of it, by all accounts.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.513
Lev is the muscle,
he does the heavy lifting.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.224
Tell me about Alexei.

35:00.224 --> 35:03.602
The brains,
but brutal when he needs to be.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.771
- Dad must be proud.
- Mm.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.940
- I keep these?
- Yeah, all yours

35:09.566 --> 35:11.026
Appreciate the heads up.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.528
We didn't even know they
were back in the country.

35:12.528 --> 35:13.612
Been living it up in London.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.280
They're up to something.

35:15.364 --> 35:18.534
Do me a favor, keep an eye on em for me.

35:18.534 --> 35:20.369
Out of our jurisdiction.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.789
But unofficially, sure.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.625
Thanks, Misha.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.295
Don't fuck around with these guys, Harry.
Not to be trifled with.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.172
Neither am I.

35:32.256 --> 35:34.174
I'll be in touch, brother.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.009
<i>Where'd you get these?</i>

35:36.093 --> 35:37.803
Sheriff's detective, West Hollywood.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.930
Russian unit. Old buddy of mine.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.014
West Hollywood?

35:41.098 --> 35:43.559
Mostly medical fraud.
He's a native speaker.

35:43.559 --> 35:46.395
He confirmed that these two guys
are high level Bratva.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.398
And Rogers owes these guys a lot of money.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.983
A ton, from what I heard.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.318
Franzen said Rogers
was cooking up a scheme

35:53.402 --> 35:54.862
that had a very steep buy-in.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.656
With some quote unquote
"unsavory characters."

35:57.656 --> 36:00.033
- Bratva.
- These two fit the bill.

36:00.117 --> 36:03.453
All right, guys who might just
want their investment back.

36:03.537 --> 36:06.290
Reason enough to persuade
Willy Datz to change his testimony

36:06.290 --> 36:07.958
to get Rogers kicked free.

36:07.958 --> 36:10.711
- Out of the frying pan...
- Mm-hmm.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.131
Did you find anything in that
directory I sent you?

36:14.131 --> 36:16.133
They're fronts.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.636
P.O. boxes with voicemail,
not actual businesses.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.264
Shit.

36:23.557 --> 36:24.766
Sokol.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.685
When Rogers was locked up,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.770
he made multiple calls
to a particular number.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.689
We traced it back to a burner cell phone

36:30.689 --> 36:33.066
purchased at a gas station in Bakersfield.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.028
Sokol Gas & Go.

36:37.863 --> 36:41.366
What would Rogers have to do with
a Gas & Go in Bakersfield?

36:41.450 --> 36:44.536
LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT
HOLLYWOOD STATION 1358

36:59.176 --> 37:00.886
You think she's going to be okay?

37:01.678 --> 37:03.388
- Who?
- Preeda Saetang.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.352
- The Thai woman.
- The rape victim.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.063
Depends on what you mean by "okay."

37:11.063 --> 37:12.648
Well, what do you mean?

37:12.648 --> 37:16.568
She may recover, God willing,
but she'll never be the same.

37:18.111 --> 37:21.698
I wonder if the guy who did it,
if he's done it before.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.493
Probably. Most likely.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.995
I'm sure the detectives are all over that.

37:28.455 --> 37:29.623
You think he's gonna do it again?

37:29.623 --> 37:33.168
I don't know. Look, let it go.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.545
We did our job,
now it's somebody else's job.

37:35.629 --> 37:37.005
I just...
I keep thinking about it.

37:37.089 --> 37:40.342
So stop. It's not your problem anymore.

37:40.342 --> 37:43.553
I, um, gave her my number.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.724
Fuck. What did you do that for?

37:47.808 --> 37:49.393
In case she needed somebody to talk to.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.812
She has somebody to talk to.
Detective Coleman.

37:54.481 --> 37:57.192
- I'm sorry. I just thought...
- Jesus Christ, Bosch. Look.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.569
If she calls, do not engage.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.697
Tell her she needs to call
Detective Coleman.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.949
That you can't talk to her.
Because you can't.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.951
You could screw up
the whole investigation.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.625
Let it go. Hear me?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.893
Ain't this the life, boy?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.689
I'm gonna go get another beer.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.817
You're a good boy.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.531
Hello?

38:45.198 --> 38:46.700
<i>You left me a message.</i>

38:48.785 --> 38:50.162
Oh, right.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.122
Could you hold on one second please?

39:02.424 --> 39:03.800
Olivia MacDonald?

39:03.884 --> 39:05.427
<i>You wanted to talk to me?</i>

39:06.553 --> 39:07.929
I'm a private investigator.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.683
I was wondering if you'd be willing to
speak with me in person.

39:11.767 --> 39:15.020
<i>- What is this about?</i>
- Dominick Santanello.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.730
<i>What about Nick?</i>

39:16.730 --> 39:19.649
<i></i> You were a friend of his? <i>- Family.</i>

39:20.567 --> 39:22.569
So Nick knew he was adopted, right?

39:22.569 --> 39:23.820
<i>Yes.</i>

39:24.780 --> 39:27.949
Did he know anything about
his background, his birth parents?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.993
<i>Nick knew his birth mother's name.</i>

39:30.077 --> 39:31.953
<i></i> Vibiana. <i>- Vibiana.</i>

39:32.037 --> 39:34.122
<i>Which is more than I knew about mine.</i>

39:35.040 --> 39:36.917
I'd like to learn more about Nick<i>.</i>

39:36.917 --> 39:39.169
Would you be willing to meet with me<i>?</i>

39:40.295 --> 39:43.090
<i>Um, when do you want to meet?</i>

39:43.090 --> 39:44.382
Tell me where you are.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.696
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

41:29.696 --> 41:31.573
<i>-</i> Hey, it's me.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.202
I'm going out of town for work.
Back tomorrow.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.870
Love you. Bye.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.381
101 NORTH

42:24.292 --> 42:28.129
We've got eyes on the target.
He's on the move heading north.
