00:02.403 --> 00:04.470
Let's think about that walk.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.205
- You're crazy.
- Hey!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.639
You promised me.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.009
[Tisa speaking]

00:12.979 --> 00:15.447
What are you gonna do
if we go to the swimming pool?

00:17.884 --> 00:19.885
We're gonna plan on you
having surgery here

00:19.887 --> 00:21.453
- in a few weeks, okay?
- Yes.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.423
But I need you
below 400 first to do it.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.092

00:32.432 --> 00:34.433

00:47.782 --> 00:49.948
<i>Me and Michael called
a home organizer</i>

00:49.950 --> 00:53.385

[tense music playing]

01:20.346 --> 01:22.014

[Amy speaking]

01:37.163 --> 01:39.965
Yeah. I feel you,
and it's okay.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.101
I'm just here
to tell you it's okay.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.084
[woman] You do the best
you can as a mom

01:59.086 --> 02:01.620

and you're improving

02:01.622 --> 02:03.155

02:03.157 --> 02:05.023
I mean,
that's what we all have to do.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.059
We just have to get better

02:07.061 --> 02:12.197
and try not to look back
and at past hurts.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.136
I know.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.839
You think your mama's doing
a good job, right, Gage?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.274
Because he feels loved.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.946
Michael,
do you wanna come help us

02:27.948 --> 02:29.314
with something real quick?

02:30.783 --> 02:32.117
[Amy speaking]

02:44.998 --> 02:46.632
[Amy] Babe, what do you think?

02:46.634 --> 02:49.368
Should we keep these?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.435
[Amy speaking]

03:04.317 --> 03:06.185
Oh, my God, it's hard.

03:06.187 --> 03:10.189
Well, yeah, so that's exactly
why we can't keep everything

03:10.191 --> 03:12.991
- just because somebody gave it to us.
- Yeah.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.593
- [Amy speaking]
- Okay.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.330
Yeah.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.300
Okay. The whole...

03:23.336 --> 03:25.037
Okay.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.338
And you think that's
something you're wanting

03:26.340 --> 03:28.006
to look back at the notes on?

03:31.277 --> 03:32.644
But you're... What?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.479
Okay.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.250
[laughs]

03:39.219 --> 03:41.153
[Michael speaking]

03:41.155 --> 03:42.187
[Amy speaking]

03:44.123 --> 03:47.125
Okay. We have
a few clothes here.

03:48.261 --> 03:50.796
Are you sure you wanna hold on
to one with a hole in it?

03:50.798 --> 03:53.465
<i>The hardest thing
to give away was the onesie</i>

03:53.467 --> 03:56.168
but it had a tiny,
little hole in it.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.703
Michael was like,
"We can buy another one."

03:57.705 --> 04:00.005
I'm like, "But he wore it."

04:00.007 --> 04:02.140
<i>But at the end of the day,
I let it go.</i>

04:02.142 --> 04:03.875
<i>It had a hole in it.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:05.344
All right.
We'll get rid of that.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.411
[woman] Okay.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.514
- [woman 1] Yay!
- [woman 2] Yay!

04:28.301 --> 04:31.069
We did. But look what
you've accomplished.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.537
You guys have done a great job.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.340
[woman] Well...

04:35.875 --> 04:37.242
We loved it. We had fun.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.311
We did.
Thank you for allowing us...

04:39.313 --> 04:40.312
- [woman] Yes.
- Into your home

04:40.314 --> 04:42.614
and we enjoyed helping you.

04:44.651 --> 04:48.787
Moving forward, I wanna keep
the idea of storage bins,

04:48.789 --> 04:50.656
everything in their place.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.997

a lot on my plate right now.</i>

a lot for Tammy.</i>

<i>There's not enough time
in my daily schedule.</i>

<i>It's time for her
to get her independence.</i>

- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.481
- We'll see you later.
- Have a safe trip.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.850
- All right.
- See you. Have a good weekend.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.207
doctor's appointment
with Dr. Smith.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.321
Tammy, you gained weight.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.391
Ain't nothing like learning
a lesson the hard way.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.159
But if you can't do exercise,

06:01.161 --> 06:04.029
that means you just can't
eat [bleep]

06:05.331 --> 06:08.567
[Tammy speaking]

06:15.341 --> 06:17.709
[Chris] We're just gonna
get you back on track

06:17.711 --> 06:19.745
and chew Amy's
ass about the cheat days.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.181
Sometimes, that girl,
love her to death,

06:23.183 --> 06:25.984
stupid to smack her
on every branch

06:25.986 --> 06:28.120
all the way down the tree
when she fell out.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.856
[phone ringing]

06:30.858 --> 06:32.858
She must have knew
I was talking about her.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.126
What's up, bitch?

06:34.128 --> 06:36.194
[Amy speaking]

06:36.196 --> 06:38.363
[Chris]
She gained 15 damn pounds.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.464

06:55.048 --> 06:57.282
See, that's the [bleep] problem.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.957
<i>And if I don't get it,
she bitches at me.</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.959
<i>If I do get it,
somebody else bitches at me.</i>

07:07.961 --> 07:09.594
I'm just tired
of getting bitched at.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.399
[Amy speaking]

07:21.641 --> 07:24.443
[Chris speaking]

[Amy speaking]

07:30.016 --> 07:31.783
[Amy speaking]

07:31.785 --> 07:33.318
[Chris] Make sure she has
the proper foods in the house

07:33.320 --> 07:35.487
and plenty of fruits
and vegetables.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.956
She's not allowed any carbs.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.925
[Amy speaking]

07:39.927 --> 07:41.726
[Chris] I'm just saying
make sure it gets done.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.195
Just be proactive,

07:43.197 --> 07:44.896
that should've already
been taken care of

07:44.898 --> 07:47.399
the first week
that she was back.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.425
[Chris] All right.
I'll talk to you later.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.527
- [Amy speaking]
- Bye.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.176
[upbeat music playing]

08:47.793 --> 08:50.195
Last time I saw Tammy
was a few days ago

08:50.197 --> 08:52.464
and it didn't really end well.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.500
Tammy, been hearing
some [bleep] girl.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.741
We were just worried
because he has made it known

09:02.743 --> 09:05.110
that he doesn't want you
under 300.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.993
<i>[Misty] Tammy was pissed off
and crying when I left,</i>

09:21.995 --> 09:24.062
<i>so I thought I'd check on her</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:27.399
and hopefully everybody
cooled off by now.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.005
So how's everything going?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.283
Mmm-hmm.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.863
Yeah. But it's just supposed
to be going down, not up.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.100
<i>Tammy has a bad habit
of not keeping her focus</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:03.234
<i>where it needs to be.</i>

10:03.236 --> 10:05.870
It quite honestly pisses me off

10:05.872 --> 10:07.739
because she know
she needs to do this

10:07.741 --> 10:09.374
to be healthier.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.002
[Misty] So what's going on
with you and...

10:38.004 --> 10:39.104
- I forgot his name.
- [Tammy] Phillip?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.105
Phillip, yeah.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.307
[birds chirping]

10:46.145 --> 10:48.113
[Tammy speaking]

10:49.615 --> 10:51.583
- Why?
- [Tammy] Why not?

10:52.885 --> 10:54.285
You have a hard time

10:54.287 --> 10:56.354
just getting up to go
to the bathroom,

10:57.256 --> 10:59.257
they do a lot of walking
in Vegas.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.528
[Tammy speaking]

11:27.920 --> 11:29.287
I guess I'd feel
a bit better about it

11:29.289 --> 11:32.123
if you were more able
to take care of yourself.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.329
<i>Tammy needs to lose some weight</i>

11:38.331 --> 11:39.998
where she's more mobile

11:40.000 --> 11:41.966
before she does things
like that.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.234
<i>But now that she has
somebody showing her</i>

11:43.236 --> 11:44.969
<i>a little bit of attention,</i>

11:44.971 --> 11:46.404
<i>it's like she's in the mindset,</i>

11:46.406 --> 11:48.640
"I'm gonna do what I <i>wanna do"</i>

11:48.642 --> 11:50.575
instead of doing
what needs to be done.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.179
I think we should meet him
before you go to Las Vegas.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.181
- No.
- [Misty] And...

11:59.652 --> 12:02.487
Because you have a tendency
to be really damn gullible.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.326
- Okay, then answer me this.
- [Tammy] Uh-huh.

12:08.328 --> 12:12.163
Why the hell do you have
such a shitty attitude

12:12.165 --> 12:13.965
since you got with him?

12:17.870 --> 12:19.137
Since she's got with Phillip,

12:19.139 --> 12:22.640
she's more crappy
about everything.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.210
<i>She hasn't been motivated.</i>

- Hey.

a lot of haters.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.081
[farts]

18:41.053 --> 18:42.153
What is that?

18:42.155 --> 18:43.121
Oh.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.489
Ew!

18:45.057 --> 18:46.624
[Amy speaking]

18:47.426 --> 18:49.393
[laughter]

18:50.329 --> 18:52.363
[bleep]

18:52.365 --> 18:53.564
[Tammy speaking]

19:02.341 --> 19:03.574
[bleep]

19:15.888 --> 19:17.822
[Amy speaking]

19:17.824 --> 19:19.390
Because I know we're gonna get
click, click, click,

19:19.392 --> 19:20.424
- click, click.
- [Tammy] Yeah.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.494
- The police?
- [Tammy speaking]

19:25.164 --> 19:27.198
Doing this in our hometown

19:27.200 --> 19:30.234
is really great, but
I'm also worried because...

19:43.048 --> 19:44.148
Yeah.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.359
<i>[Amy] The fair is huge</i>

19:55.361 --> 19:56.994
<i>and Michael does not</i>

19:56.996 --> 19:58.095
<i>wanna push Tammy around</i>

19:58.097 --> 19:59.363
<i>this meet-and-greet,</i>

19:59.365 --> 20:01.399
<i>so we borrowed my mom's</i>

20:01.401 --> 20:03.668
<i>motorized wheelchair for Tammy.</i>

20:06.638 --> 20:08.272
[Tammy speaking]

20:12.878 --> 20:13.644
[Amy] Dang it.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.182
[acoustic music playing]

20:35.133 --> 20:37.001
[Amy speaking]

20:44.943 --> 20:48.012
<i>I'm hoping to release
some of this back pain,</i>

20:48.014 --> 20:49.981
<i>because we got
a meet-and-greet coming up.</i>

20:50.148 --> 20:51.349
[bleep]

20:52.284 --> 20:53.884
- Hello.
- [woman] How are you doing?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.152
Good, how are you?

21:01.126 --> 21:02.994
<i>Maybe we could turn some
lights off,</i>

21:02.996 --> 21:05.463
get some music, oh, yeah.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.298
Marvin's Gaye's bitches.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.467
[laughs]

21:18.844 --> 21:20.945
Tell me, um, first,

21:20.947 --> 21:22.413
what do you hope
we can help you with?

21:22.415 --> 21:25.016
Um, I was organizing the house

21:25.018 --> 21:27.084
and I pulled a muscle
in my back.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.919
Okay. So, yeah.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.788
Acupuncture would be
a great place to start.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.890
Michael, what would you say
is your main complaint?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.092
- [Michael speaking]
- [Dr. Corey] Okay.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.162
<i>[Amy] Michael has a bad back
from pushing Tammy around.</i>

21:38.164 --> 21:40.031
[Amy speaking]

21:44.236 --> 21:45.970
Well, do you have
any questions for me

21:45.972 --> 21:47.238
about anything in general?

21:47.240 --> 21:48.372
[Michael speaking]

21:52.077 --> 21:53.411
No. You don't have to.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.447
No, ma'am.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.284
Well, we're just gonna
lift up your shirt...

22:00.286 --> 22:01.986
- [Amy] Oh, okay.
- For your lower back, so...

22:08.894 --> 22:10.795
Quite all right.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.931
Acupuncture was made
4,000 years ago

22:13.933 --> 22:16.967
by these Chinese dudes
that just...

22:16.969 --> 22:18.402
I guess they like bondage

22:18.404 --> 22:19.770
because they like
to poke each other

22:19.772 --> 22:21.539
with [bleep] needles.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.177
[Dr. Corey]
That wasn't too bad, was it?

22:27.446 --> 22:28.512
That's right.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.083
[Amy speaking]

22:33.051 --> 22:37.021
[Dr. Corey] Usually within
about five, ten seconds,

22:37.023 --> 22:39.123
even if you feel it go in,

22:39.125 --> 22:41.525
it will just,
kind of, will drift away.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.394
So it should be
nice and pleasant.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.663
[Amy speaking]

22:45.665 --> 22:47.031
Is that what you feel like?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.299
[Amy] Yeah.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.134
[Amy speaking]

22:55.607 --> 22:56.507
[Amy speaking]

23:03.248 --> 23:04.348
Huh?

23:04.950 --> 23:06.584
[Amy speaking]

23:07.486 --> 23:08.586
[Michael speaking]

23:23.101 --> 23:25.336
[Amy speaking]

23:26.304 --> 23:28.038
All right. You guys
are free to move about,

23:28.040 --> 23:30.074
so let's have you go ahead

23:30.076 --> 23:32.543
and slowly just
[indistinct] out.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.447
[Amy speaking]

23:43.955 --> 23:45.623
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.629
[upbeat music playing]

23:56.401 --> 23:58.402
- [Michael speaking]
- [Amy] Yup.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.573
[Tammy speaking]

24:26.298 --> 24:27.965
[Amy speaking]

24:27.967 --> 24:29.066
[laughs]

24:32.137 --> 24:35.506
My back is feeling a lot
better since the acupuncture

24:35.508 --> 24:39.009
but I have no body strength
to push Tammy's fat ass.

24:40.278 --> 24:43.647
[Amy speaking]

24:51.256 --> 24:54.191
[Tammy speaking]

25:00.131 --> 25:01.499
[Amy speaking]

25:03.134 --> 25:04.869
[Tammy]
What's that sign say, like?

25:04.871 --> 25:06.103
[Michael and Amy]
Amy and Tammy Slaton

25:06.105 --> 25:07.438
- tonight 5 to 7.
- Oh, my God.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.040
I'm [bleep] yeah,
that's so cool.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.076
[Amy speaking]

25:12.078 --> 25:13.177
[Michael speaking]

25:22.454 --> 25:23.587
[Michael speaking]

25:28.326 --> 25:31.262
[Tammy speaking]

25:32.464 --> 25:35.566
[grunts] Let me sit
in here right now.

25:49.247 --> 25:50.648
Really, Michael?

25:51.383 --> 25:54.118
- [Michael speaking]
- Yeah.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.591
[Tammy] Okay.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.643
[Tammy speaking]

26:28.887 --> 26:29.987
Hmm.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.230
[tense music playing]

26:46.304 --> 26:48.305
[Tammy speaking]

26:52.978 --> 26:54.878
Michael does not
wanna push Tammy around

26:54.880 --> 26:56.013
this meet-and-greet.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.388
[Tammy] I can't fit.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.128
[Michael] I wonder if I can
take this off.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.107
You wanna put this back
on the truck or...

27:23.109 --> 27:24.141
Yeah.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.481
[Tammy speaking]

27:40.091 --> 27:41.225
[Michael speaking]

27:46.197 --> 27:47.398
That part went low.

28:06.051 --> 28:07.184
[Tammy] Yeah.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.857
- [Michael speaking]
- [Tammy] What?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.259
- [Tammy speaking]
- Yup.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.028
[Tammy speaking]

28:19.164 --> 28:22.499
[Amy speaking]

28:29.074 --> 28:30.207
You might have to stand up.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.276
[Michael speaking]

28:36.181 --> 28:38.182
- [Tammy] Aw!
- [Michael speaking]

28:41.086 --> 28:43.353
[Amy]
Can you walk to the gravel?

28:46.958 --> 28:47.991
[Tammy speaking]

28:48.927 --> 28:50.227
[Michael speaking]

28:50.229 --> 28:52.229
Tammy's mobility
has gone downhill.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.897
[Michael grunts]

28:53.899 --> 28:55.833
[Amy] I know Tisa's
<i>pushing Tammy</i>

28:55.835 --> 28:57.201
<i>to walk a little bit,</i>

28:57.203 --> 29:00.070
but it ain't going off great.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.371
Here we go.

29:02.974 --> 29:04.308
- Yeah.
- [grunts]

29:05.610 --> 29:07.111
[Michael laughs]

29:07.113 --> 29:08.645
[Amy] He wants to ride with you.

29:08.647 --> 29:10.280
- [Tammy chuckles]
- We're just lucky

29:10.282 --> 29:12.216
after all that drama with Tammy,

29:12.218 --> 29:14.918
she's okay and we can go
to the meet-and-greet.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.653
Wait for me. Wait for me.
Wait for me...

29:16.655 --> 29:18.355
[laughs] Hey, it's over here.

29:18.857 --> 29:22.059
[upbeat music playing]

29:24.863 --> 29:26.730
[Tammy]
<i>The more and more people</i>

29:26.732 --> 29:28.665
<i>start showing up in line,</i>

29:28.667 --> 29:31.168
<i>uh, the more nervous
I'm getting.</i>

29:31.170 --> 29:38.041
This being our first
real hometown meet-and-greet.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.377
<i>It's, kind of,
shocking to know that</i>

29:40.379 --> 29:45.015
all these people come here
just to see us.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.986
<i>But also, kind of,
scared because...</i>

30:04.269 --> 30:05.936
- [woman] Hi, guys.
- Hi.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.371
I seen you guys on YouTube.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.572
Amazing.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.076
[woman speaking]

30:15.446 --> 30:17.915
Did you guys go to, um,
Union County School?

30:17.917 --> 30:18.982
Yes.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.186
Thomas.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.188
[laughter]

30:36.401 --> 30:39.102
[Cassie speaking]

30:39.104 --> 30:41.605
[Tammy speaking]

30:48.947 --> 30:50.981
- [woman speaking]
- Aww, thank you.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.250
Yeah.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.656
I've been a fan of the Slaton
sisters for a few years now.

30:59.658 --> 31:04.061
So I came to the fair today
mainly for the meet-and-greet.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.363
Um, I myself have lost
a lot of weight.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.265
<i>It's not easy, but I think</i>

31:08.267 --> 31:10.133
<i>that they are
very good motivators.</i>

31:10.135 --> 31:12.636
I know Amy set out a goal
to lose weight

31:12.638 --> 31:14.137
and she did it.

31:14.139 --> 31:16.473
<i>And Tammy, I know she's trying,</i>

31:16.475 --> 31:18.408
but I definitely support her
100%.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.943
Attention.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.082
[Tammy speaking]

31:26.284 --> 31:29.186
Me and Tammy decide to play
a little game with our fans.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.521
A little Q & A with T & A.

31:38.329 --> 31:39.997
[Tammy speaking]

31:39.999 --> 31:41.298
[laughter]

31:47.305 --> 31:49.106
[woman] Yeah, Michael.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.540
<i>The grand prize is Michael</i>

31:50.542 --> 31:53.176
actually agreed to have
a pie in his face.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.654
You.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.595
- False.
- False.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.299
[Tammy speaking]

32:15.301 --> 32:17.401

32:17.403 --> 32:18.602
[woman speaking]

32:19.037 --> 32:20.938
- Yes! Yes!
- Purple.

32:26.411 --> 32:30.981
It is weird knowing people
pay that much attention to us

32:30.983 --> 32:34.451
to get questions
like that right.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.354
[Tammy speaking]

32:43.127 --> 32:45.028
Who's the winner [indistinct]

32:45.030 --> 32:48.031
- [Amy] Dominique!
- Whoo!

32:48.033 --> 32:50.267
Dominique won by landslide.

32:50.269 --> 32:53.170
She...
That girl knew who we was.

32:53.838 --> 32:55.872
- Congratulations, girl.
- Okay.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.342
You're now allowed
to pie my husband.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.649
[cheers and laughter]

33:07.952 --> 33:10.020
[Tammy speaking]

33:24.302 --> 33:26.303
[Amy speaking]

33:50.028 --> 33:51.461
[laughs]

33:56.868 --> 33:59.336
Okay. One, two, three.

34:04.909 --> 34:06.076
[Tisa] You can walk that far.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.577
Yes, you can.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.147
That. You can make it
that far.

34:10.948 --> 34:12.482
Are you kidding me?

34:12.484 --> 34:15.318
She would have me push
her from the car,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.888
inside the pool,
out of the pool,

34:17.890 --> 34:19.589
<i>back to the car
if she had her way.</i>

34:24.495 --> 34:26.496
[country music playing]

34:30.168 --> 34:33.470
[Tisa speaking]

34:34.305 --> 34:36.306
[Tammy speaking]

34:36.308 --> 34:39.276
I felt like I had a purpose.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.033
- Yeah.
- [Tisa] And I'll be back.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.541
[Tammy speaking]

35:16.147 --> 35:17.647
Come on, sexy!

35:18.616 --> 35:19.816
<i>That water is deep.</i>

35:19.818 --> 35:21.151
<i>[Tammy] No, it's not.</i>

35:21.153 --> 35:22.352
[Tisa]
Looks awfully deep to me.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.387
[Tammy] It's not!

35:24.389 --> 35:26.389
- [women] Hello.
- [Tisa] Hello, ladies.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.993
[Tisa]
<i>I am terrified of the water</i>

35:29.995 --> 35:31.161
<i>because I can't swim.</i>

35:31.163 --> 35:32.896
But I will do anything

35:32.898 --> 35:34.364
to get Tammy in the water.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.967
Anything for this class.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.202
[Tisa speaking]

35:40.905 --> 35:42.305
Okay.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.107
- Yeah.
- [Tisa] I might get drowned.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.277
[Tisa speaking]

35:50.314 --> 35:51.448
Uh-huh.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.258
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

36:17.308 --> 36:18.975
Whee!

36:18.977 --> 36:20.143
[screams]

36:20.145 --> 36:21.178
[laughs]

36:25.816 --> 36:27.317
[laughs]

36:27.319 --> 36:28.752
Yeah, you're going...

36:28.754 --> 36:31.188
[Tammy speaking]

36:31.190 --> 36:32.856
<i>When she gets down in the pool,</i>

36:32.858 --> 36:36.259
I can just see a different
glow in her face.

36:36.261 --> 36:40.163
<i>She's in the water
and she can do movement.</i>

36:40.165 --> 36:41.898
Put your hands on your hips,

36:41.900 --> 36:43.500
go forward and back.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.670
And you...
Oh, and you're going down low.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.440
She's flapping her arms around,

36:50.442 --> 36:51.975
<i>she's kicking her legs,</i>

36:51.977 --> 36:53.276
<i>she's popping her ass around,</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:54.477
<i>she's doing it all.</i>

36:57.181 --> 36:58.648
[Tisa] Oh!

36:58.650 --> 37:01.117
- [Tisa speaking]
- [laughs]

37:01.285 --> 37:03.486
[Tisa speaking]

37:05.223 --> 37:07.057
Barbell swing on the side,

37:07.059 --> 37:08.058
back and forth.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.159
That was hard.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.033
Come on, sister.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.501
[woman] Go back and forth
on each side.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.209
Come on.

37:29.847 --> 37:33.383
Tammy is the youngest one
in the water

37:33.385 --> 37:37.554
<i>but the ladies in the pool
are doing better than Tammy.</i>

37:41.058 --> 37:42.425
[Tisa speaking]

37:57.308 --> 37:59.209
You know what? I'll carry
them, we can walk back.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.889
<i>She would have me push her</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:15.125
from inside the pool,
out of the pool,

38:15.127 --> 38:17.060
back to the car
if she had her way.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.200
[Tisa speaking]

38:39.650 --> 38:41.318
[Tammy]
<i>When you're not in the pool,</i>

38:41.320 --> 38:43.486
<i>it's like harder to get around.</i>

38:44.088 --> 38:47.057
Carrying around 640 lbs.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.360
Is a lot on your body,
on your knees,

38:50.362 --> 38:52.128
your feet, your ankles.

38:54.432 --> 38:55.799
[Tisa] When we get down
to that ground,

38:55.801 --> 38:58.001
I'mma let you walk to the car,
okay?

38:58.003 --> 39:00.036
- [Tammy speaking]
- [Tisa] And you can walk.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.538
[Tammy] I'm hurting my back.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.180
What is rough?

39:10.182 --> 39:12.282
That. You can make it that far

39:13.050 --> 39:15.685
because I know you can walk.
Come on.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.987
I'mma get that thing
out of the car.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.691
But this right here is rough
[bleep] are you kidding me?

39:21.693 --> 39:25.729
Not only it's hard to push
Tammy in that wheelchair,

39:25.731 --> 39:29.966
the wheelchair itself is heavy
and it's a lot of strength.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.569
Come on. I can't do this
blacktop with you.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.106
Come on.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.608
Get behind the...

39:38.610 --> 39:40.210
I'm putting the wheelchair
in front of you

39:40.212 --> 39:41.311
and you push the wheelchair
like you...

39:41.313 --> 39:44.180
- No.
- [Tisa speaking]

39:44.182 --> 39:46.282
- I got it.
- [Tisa] You got it.

40:01.432 --> 40:05.869
Now, I cannot push you in
that wheelchair like that

40:05.871 --> 40:08.037
and hurt myself,

40:08.039 --> 40:10.640
because I know
that you can walk.

40:13.244 --> 40:17.647
That's just [bleep]
you can walk.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.853
And I've seen you walk well.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.488
And I don't give a damn
what you say.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.525
Tammy, hello?

40:29.894 --> 40:31.361
Well, I know you hear me.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.231
Now, you can get mad at me
all you want.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.635
There's people
in worse shape than you are.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.171
They wish they had two legs.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.940
This is crazy.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.043
[tense music playing]

40:47.945 --> 40:51.181
[Tammy speaking]

41:07.998 --> 41:09.999
You watched me
lift that damn heavy thing

41:10.001 --> 41:11.534
and your ass can walk.

41:14.405 --> 41:17.106
There's people
with no legs tries to walk

41:18.742 --> 41:20.210
and you can do it.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.279
Ain't no sense
you handicapping yourself.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.582
I've come to see you
two days a week,

41:26.116 --> 41:27.484
and two days a week,

41:27.486 --> 41:29.586
we're gonna make
some damn progress.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.989
That's just [bleep]

41:35.759 --> 41:38.394
[narrator]
<i>Next time on 1000-lb Sisters.</i>

41:38.396 --> 41:40.830
<i>So today, me and Michael
are going to see</i>

41:40.832 --> 41:43.366
about getting
skin removal surgery.

41:43.368 --> 41:45.635
[woman] As you can see,
the volume reduction

41:45.637 --> 41:47.170
gives a new jawline.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.938
Oh, my God, I'm ugly.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.441
<i>Without hair,
I look like a sloth.</i>

41:52.610 --> 41:55.011
<i>[Tammy] Today is my first
session with a therapist</i>

41:55.013 --> 41:57.013
but I really don't wanna go.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.349
Tell me what brings you
to therapy.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.788
You look like
you're scowling at me,

42:05.790 --> 42:07.423
like you don't wanna be here.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.060
Let's find out
what this number is

42:11.062 --> 42:12.128
and then we'll talk.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.164
<i>[Chris] Here we go.</i>

42:15.166 --> 42:16.266
<i>And I'm gonna need
all the prayers</i>

42:16.268 --> 42:17.400
<i>so start praying.</i>

42:17.402 --> 42:19.235
<i>I just hope I make it.</i>

42:19.237 --> 42:21.304
I'm tired of
working on something

42:21.306 --> 42:22.372
<i>and not ever making it.</i>
