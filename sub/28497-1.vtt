Hello?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.441
Hello?

04:05.166 --> 04:07.250
I'm an emergency doctor.
What is going on?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.541
Traffic accident.
Someone is stuck.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.250
No one else, I think.
It's hard to see.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.125
I have to reach the patient.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.791
Mario, come here.

04:24.416 --> 04:27.109
Hey, can you hear me?

04:27.458 --> 04:30.489
Pulse is weak, but regular.
One survivor.

04:30.625 --> 04:34.125
This goes around your neck,
for stabilization.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.666
We'll open the trunk.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.083
The door is open.
- Stretcher.

04:41.166 --> 04:44.083
1, 2, 3.
- I've got his head.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.208
Succinylcholine.
- How much?

04:58.333 --> 04:59.166
50.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.333
Begin.
- Brace.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.583
Bloodpressure 60 over 40.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.083
Bloodpressure?
- 100 over 70.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.500
He is stable.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.541
He can go now.
