WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.660
<i>Zod's preparing to move</i>

00:03.830 --> 00:05.370
<i>most of his forces topside.</i>

00:05.540 --> 00:07.580
Entire unit's mobilizing
for the Elevator Base Station.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.960
Yes!
We are off the frontline.

00:10.130 --> 00:11.620
<i>It's a perfect choke point.</i>

00:11.800 --> 00:14.130
We could use
our existing oxygenators

00:14.300 --> 00:15.340
<i>to attack them en route</i>

00:15.510 --> 00:17.050
<i>all the way
to the Elevator Base Station.</i>

00:17.220 --> 00:19.590
<i>We gain control
of the Space Elevator.</i>

00:19.930 --> 00:21.760
<i>Isolate Zod's
remaining forces.</i>

00:21.930 --> 00:23.800
<i>He wouldn't be able to
keep sending up reinforcements</i>

00:23.980 --> 00:25.470
<i>and supplies
the way he has been.</i>

00:25.730 --> 00:28.100
Dru-Zod sent me up here
to be his spy.

00:28.270 --> 00:29.560
<i>He has Cor-Vex.</i>

00:29.730 --> 00:31.470
The intel Nyssa gave us
was accurate.

00:31.690 --> 00:32.600
<i>They're still suspicious.</i>

00:32.780 --> 00:34.940
Then you need to regain
their trust.

00:35.110 --> 00:36.480
Nice to see you, Araame.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.410
<i>We had some nice times.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:41.110
<i>I need you to find the
Codex and then bring it to me.</i>

00:41.410 --> 00:43.120
Help me, please.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.660
- What's your name?
- Raika.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.830
<i>Anything from
our Cythonnite woman?</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:49.080
When it's over,
you'll be a different person.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.870
You won't even remember
this conversation.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.050
Ah!

00:53.220 --> 00:55.210
I have a plan to kill Dru-Zod

00:55.340 --> 00:56.960
<i>to save Lyta.</i>

00:57.090 --> 00:59.050
She's Dru-Zod's right hand.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.710
<i>Everything I've believed in,
it's all a lie.</i>

01:01.890 --> 01:04.379
I've chosen to live on
in you.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.520
<i>While Brainiac
has access to my mind,</i>

01:06.730 --> 01:08.440
<i>I also have access
to his mind.</i>

01:08.730 --> 01:10.890
<i>He's weak.
I know what we have to do.</i>

01:11.070 --> 01:13.430
- <i>I know how to beat Brainiac.</i>
- Ah!

01:13.610 --> 01:15.100
<i>Activate
the Zeta-Beam Device,</i>

01:15.280 --> 01:16.270
<i>we go back to Krypton.</i>

01:17.530 --> 01:19.440
Was I dead?

01:19.660 --> 01:22.070
Maybe just a little bit,
but I un-deaded you.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.200
- What the--?
- Hey, calm down.

01:24.370 --> 01:25.990
Look, we're here.
It worked.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.000
Whoo!

01:29.710 --> 01:31.830
<i>Everyone
return to your homes.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:34.290
<i>Citizens found outside
will be arrested.</i>

01:34.840 --> 01:36.710
<i>Curfew is now in effect.</i>

01:37.760 --> 01:38.720
<i>Everyone should...</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:40.800
And after a Rondor
sheds its tusk,

01:40.970 --> 01:42.300
it eats it, Seg.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.300
It eats it
to sharpen its teeth.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.810
Fascinating.
Easy there, easy there.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.140
And how about you
tell me more as we walk?

01:48.350 --> 01:50.560
Or I can tell you more
as we walk.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.390
- Sounds like a deal.
- Whoa.

01:55.030 --> 01:57.490
- Over there. Down there.
- No, I don't have...

01:57.650 --> 01:59.360
Kem, you stay here, man.
I'll be right back.

01:59.570 --> 02:01.030
All right, yeah.

02:03.040 --> 02:03.700
Hey.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.700
Can you just let her pack up
her things and be on her way?

02:05.870 --> 02:07.200
She never causes any trouble.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.910
Great, then our transaction
will be quick.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.500
Transaction?

02:13.670 --> 02:15.460
You're--you're a customer?

02:15.630 --> 02:18.170
Mm-hmm. I like gifts
that are made by hand.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.670
These days you can only
find that here in Rankless.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.050
Huh.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.180
So, thank you,
but you can go now.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.470
Yeah.
Yeah, sorry, sorry, I...

02:33.520 --> 02:34.760
I'm sorry.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.400
Um, I can't leave.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.740
Not if you genuinely plan

02:40.910 --> 02:43.270
on giving someone
that hideous thing.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.570
It's not...

02:45.870 --> 02:47.450
It is hideous, isn't it?

02:47.830 --> 02:49.120
Only in every way.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.460
Could I ask who it's for?

02:54.630 --> 02:56.410
Uh, my betrothed.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.670
Our Binding date
will be set soon

02:58.840 --> 03:00.210
and it's tradition to...

03:00.380 --> 03:02.470
Yeah, oh, no, yeah.
Tradition.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.250
Um, well,

03:04.760 --> 03:09.260
if after having met me
you're still intent

03:09.430 --> 03:13.390
on Binding with this
inconceivably lucky individual,

03:13.560 --> 03:16.730
um, perhaps you'll let me help
you pick something else.

03:19.030 --> 03:23.440
Right, well, despite having met
you for less than a minute,

03:23.740 --> 03:26.900
I'm still actually planning
on going ahead with my Binding,

03:27.200 --> 03:28.610
but I'll take you up
on your offer.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.700
Of--of help.
Of helping me choose a gift.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.460
Not, you know...

03:36.960 --> 03:38.080
I'm glad that's settled.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.870
Well, if it were me, um,
I'd, uh...

03:43.340 --> 03:44.960
probably go with something
like this.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.930
I can't really picture it.
Can you show me?

03:49.680 --> 03:50.920
You want me to show you?

03:53.440 --> 03:54.640
Okay.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.140
Um...

04:19.760 --> 04:22.920
I think this is
definitely the one.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.710
The pilferer...

04:30.310 --> 04:31.920
- I fell.
- Yes, I can see that.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.260
Come on, sir,
let me help you.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.100
There you go.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.270
Aren't you a little short
to be a Sagitari?

04:37.440 --> 04:38.770
Seg, isn't she a little short
to be--?

04:38.940 --> 04:39.980
No, no, no, she's perfect.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.770
I mean, you're perfect.
You--your height...

04:42.940 --> 04:47.230
for a Sagitari is correct.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.070
Um, I--I've got him.

04:52.450 --> 04:53.160
Thank you.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.820
You're welcome.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.210
You know, you're the only
Sagitari to ever help me.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.960
Well, not all Sagitari
are the same.

05:04.760 --> 05:09.250
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.
Now.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.220
So this is how you met her.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.970
Hey, good morning there,
sleepyhead.

05:20.150 --> 05:21.730
You know, you look like
three kinds of shit.

05:21.940 --> 05:25.310
Yeah, well, at
least I feel as good as I look.

05:28.030 --> 05:29.860
You know, Kandor's not far.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.150
If we don't stop, we can make
it in the next few hours.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.940
Ah, whoa, whoa, easy.
Easy.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.250
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, all right?

05:38.710 --> 05:40.070
We don't have respirators.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.870
And you know, you just
about died a few hours ago.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.710
I did die,
because you killed me.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.710
You know, and that's
in the past, all right?

05:47.880 --> 05:50.090
Look, I'm--what I'm saying
is that we are planning

05:50.260 --> 05:51.840
on taking on a dictator
that is so evil

05:52.010 --> 05:53.750
that people just
let him wear a cape,

05:54.430 --> 05:57.850
and I don't want you to
get hurt or dead again.

05:59.650 --> 06:03.260
Adam, I'll be fine.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.390
Whatever else he is,
Dru-Zod is still my son.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.260
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

06:43.150 --> 06:46.140
<i>Warning. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

06:47.860 --> 06:50.070
Ah.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.040
Don't move, Sagitari.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.500
I don't believe it.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.800
- This was my Rankless sector.
- Yeah.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.850
Welcome to General Zod's
Kandor.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.100
I don't recognize anything.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.060
- It's like he erased it all.
- Yeah.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.600
It's like--
it's like the Rankless...

07:30.200 --> 07:31.610
It's like
my home never existed.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.490
Well,
that's one version of it.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.900
The other

07:37.080 --> 07:38.360
is that.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.320
The savior of Krypton.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.240
Now you see why it's hard
for Val to recruit Rebels.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.660
But we'll figure it out, right?
What're you thinking?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.170
You think that we could, uh...?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.330
That's your "I'm doing this
alone face," isn't it?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.010
I don't have
an "I'm doing it alone face."

07:55.220 --> 07:56.300
- What're you talking about?
- You're doing it right now.

07:56.470 --> 07:57.800
- No, I'm not.
- Right to my face. You do--

07:57.970 --> 07:59.630
Well, I'm sorry, Adam.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.590
Look, I need you
to go ahead of me.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.930
Find Val, tell him I'm alive,

08:04.100 --> 08:05.190
and tell him
I'll be with him soon.

08:07.110 --> 08:08.270
And then we can end this.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.230
You got a plan, smart guy?

08:10.400 --> 08:13.020
Eh, I got the start of one.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.780
Lyta's a beloved
and respected leader of Kandor

08:15.950 --> 08:17.240
from House Zod, right?

08:17.410 --> 08:20.570
If she's seen standing with me,
with the Rebellion,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.410
that could turn some
of Zod's followers against him.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.990
Oh, that's your plan?

08:25.460 --> 08:29.450
'Cause... all right,
that could work.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.080
If I don't hear from you by
tomorrow, I'm coming back here.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.250
Fair enough.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.220
Hey, um,

08:37.890 --> 08:40.000
I just wanna let you know
I'm really grateful.

08:40.809 --> 08:42.049
For everything.

08:42.809 --> 08:44.520
You got me home,

08:45.150 --> 08:47.980
so thank you.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.270
That's all right, it's just
I don't get thanked often,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.530
so, uh, you know,

08:57.700 --> 08:59.530
I don't know
what I should do here.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.740
You don't have
to do anything, you just--

09:01.950 --> 09:03.740
Okay.

09:04.870 --> 09:05.950
Okay.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.490
Okay.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.370
All right.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.120
I'll see you on Wegthor,
Earth-man.

09:26.690 --> 09:29.180
Ow.
Thank you.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.400
- Was he a friend?
- No.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.650
No, I hated his guts, actually.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.900
He didn't think much of us
conscripted.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.540
Said we weren't loyal enough,
which, you know,

09:45.660 --> 09:46.650
is accurate.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.200
You outlasted 99% of the real
Sagitari in your regiment.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.330
You must be doing
something right.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.420
Didn't realize not dying
was a skill.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.380
Thought it was stupid luck.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.010
Ready my transport.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.420
<i>Yes, Primus.</i>

10:19.160 --> 10:20.190
Hi.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.240
Cancel my transport.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.730
That's enough!

10:56.480 --> 10:59.400
This war is not over.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.140
But I will say this.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.820
It feels damn good to win.
Well done, everybody.

11:03.990 --> 11:07.080
Good job.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.200
We're even more pleased
that such a victory

11:09.330 --> 11:11.370
cost us so few lives.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.250
Val's right,
so for the fallen

11:14.420 --> 11:18.080
we owe a great deal
of gratitude to Nyssa Vex.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.330
And I'm sorry I doubted you.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.800
Last night's victory
has opened up a hole

11:25.010 --> 11:28.600
in Zod's defensive forces,
but time is limited.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.300
Sagitari reinforcements
will be sent for.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.060
Before they arrive,

11:33.230 --> 11:37.020
we have a chance to cut Zod off
from Wegthor completely,

11:37.230 --> 11:38.940
if we act fast.

11:39.070 --> 11:42.110
We used the last of our
short-term oxygenator supply

11:42.280 --> 11:43.860
on last night's assault,

11:44.240 --> 11:47.030
but using these long-range ones

11:47.240 --> 11:49.200
we gained
from Zod's supply convoy,

11:49.330 --> 11:51.240
our ground forces
can finally make the trek

11:51.410 --> 11:52.780
to the Elevator Base Station.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.700
We take that,
we control the Space Elevator.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.010
We control Wegthor.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.630
This guy appeared
from nowhere.

12:04.010 --> 12:06.470
- Adam?
- Hi, Val.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.890
Uh, hi,

12:13.850 --> 12:15.590
other Rebels.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.060
Jax.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.700
So strange being here
with you,

12:31.870 --> 12:34.240
not worrying
that we'll get caught.

12:34.370 --> 12:35.540
It's pretty hard
to get in trouble

12:35.710 --> 12:37.420
when you're sleeping
with the Primus.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.580
There are still plenty of
ways we can get into trouble.

12:46.970 --> 12:48.590
I love you, Lyta.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.680
Seeing you.
Being with you.

12:53.310 --> 12:55.680
Most days it was all
that I could think of.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.270
You helped bring me home.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.010
Once again,

13:00.190 --> 13:04.060
you are still the only Sagitari
to ever help me.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.810
What?

13:08.990 --> 13:09.950
Lyta, you're bleeding.

13:10.450 --> 13:11.360
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

13:11.540 --> 13:13.450
Yeah, I've been
getting them lately,

13:13.620 --> 13:16.780
since the war started.
Um, it must be stress.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.000
You and Dru
have taken on a lot.

13:23.090 --> 13:26.380
Well, someone
had to lead the people.

13:31.430 --> 13:33.470
What did Jayna
think about it?

13:36.270 --> 13:40.430
I don't know.
No one's seen her.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.190
Lyta, when I was
in the Phantom Zone

13:44.320 --> 13:45.980
I had a vision
of the future.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.610
What do you mean?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.820
It told me that Dru,

13:55.580 --> 13:57.490
he's not all he says he is.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.460
Dru, our son...

14:03.170 --> 14:05.750
was the last piece of you
I had left.

14:07.970 --> 14:12.090
I chose to believe
he'd unite us, and he did.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.760
Adam Strange
has seen a future

14:15.890 --> 14:18.220
where our son has conquered the
galaxy

14:18.390 --> 14:19.810
against its collective will.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.520
And you and I,
we can stop that.

14:24.690 --> 14:27.680
We can save him
from his obsession.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.860
We can create
a new future.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.570
Get dressed.
Come with me.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.710
<i>Seg's alive?</i>

14:41.920 --> 14:45.500
I don't believe it.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.040
And yet, somehow I always knew

14:47.220 --> 14:48.750
Seg would find a way
out of the Phantom Zone.

14:48.970 --> 14:52.460
Yeah, he's got some stones
on him, that's for sure.

14:53.970 --> 14:55.260
Thank you, Adam.

14:55.430 --> 14:57.890
All along you kept hope alive.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.770
You would've made a good El.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.980
Ah.
Appreciate that.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.930
But, um, I think you might be

15:06.070 --> 15:09.150
thanking me
just a little bit too soon.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.940
- What is it?
- I don't know, Val.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.780
You're the scientist here,

15:12.910 --> 15:15.900
but I think that somehow,
somewhere along the way

15:16.040 --> 15:19.620
I--I think
I might have effed up and...

15:19.790 --> 15:21.370
And broke the damn universe.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.120
- Broke it?
- Yeah.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.000
What do you mean?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.910
Well,
before I returned to Krypton

15:27.090 --> 15:28.830
I was using the Zeta-Beam
and I--

15:29.050 --> 15:31.760
I caught a glimpse
of the future,

15:32.760 --> 15:34.340
but there was nothing.

15:35.470 --> 15:37.090
I mean, it was like
I hit a wall.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.010
There was nowhere
that I could go forward.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.020
It was as if, uh,

15:42.190 --> 15:44.390
time had stopped.

15:45.150 --> 15:47.520
Okay, now, what if--what if
everything that's happened

15:47.650 --> 15:50.440
with Brainiac and Zod,
Krypton and Earth,

15:50.610 --> 15:51.980
what if everything
that's changed

15:52.160 --> 15:53.400
since I gave Seg the Sunstone,

15:53.610 --> 15:55.450
what if that all rippled
through time and space

15:55.620 --> 15:57.360
and has been building
like a tsunami

15:57.540 --> 15:59.740
into this catastrophic
universe-ending shitstorm

15:59.910 --> 16:01.030
and...

16:01.910 --> 16:03.330
And what if it's all my fault?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.240
Adam, whatever you saw,

16:06.420 --> 16:09.000
I highly doubt
that you were responsible.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.830
Still, still,

16:12.050 --> 16:14.380
we gotta fix it.
There's gotta be a way, right?

16:14.550 --> 16:17.470
- I mean--
- If there is, we will find it.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.170
But the best way
to help the universe

16:20.390 --> 16:24.350
is to stop Zod now
and win the war.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.480
Right. Okay.

16:26.650 --> 16:27.890
Stop Zod here and now,

16:28.070 --> 16:30.400
that makes
a certain amount of sense.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.280
Tell me how I can help.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.710
Cor, meet your father,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.160
Seg-El.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.000
There we go.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.970
Hi, you little guy.

17:01.470 --> 17:02.840
His hair, it's...

17:03.680 --> 17:04.920
It's so dark.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.810
Luckily he takes after you.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.810
Some nights I come in
and look at him,

17:12.030 --> 17:15.859
think of you,
see your face.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.150
What happened with Nyssa?

17:19.990 --> 17:21.530
Why do you have him?

17:22.790 --> 17:24.700
Nyssa's working with us now.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.700
Helping fight the Rebellion.

17:26.869 --> 17:29.240
It's complicated, Seg,
but I can explain it all.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.160
Just stay here.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.630
When I'm back,
no one will keep us apart.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.210
We'll be with our son.
We can be a family.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.840
Our son?

17:42.720 --> 17:45.180
Lyta, Cor will always be

17:45.390 --> 17:46.850
mine and Nyssa's child.

17:49.810 --> 17:52.850
She doesn't mean Cor-Vex,
Father.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.690
You told him I was here.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.690
Lyta, what're you doing?

18:02.660 --> 18:04.070
This isn't you.

18:04.290 --> 18:07.120
It is. And it will
all make sense soon.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.620
And I know you'll understand.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.520
May I?

18:53.460 --> 18:55.920
I'm sorry you had to see me
like that last night.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.630
You do not owe me
an explanation, Dev.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.590
But I'll listen to anything
you want to say.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.510
It's a long story.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.050
I'm not going anywhere.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.630
The Rebels had been
picking us off.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.180
They knew the tunnels.

19:13.770 --> 19:16.730
Despite our numbers, we were at
a significant disadvantage.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.900
Our job was to never
let them realize that.

19:27.910 --> 19:30.200
Commander,
I've got a bio-reading.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.330
With all this interference,
I can't tell who or what it is.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.580
Set it to thermal.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.210
It's okay,
it's just civilians.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.000
Families.
My scanner's picking up

19:44.180 --> 19:45.840
hundreds more
beyond the chamber.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.050
Leave them alone.
Let's keep it moving on.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.680
- All right.
- That's it?

19:51.230 --> 19:52.810
Those miners could be
harboring Rebels.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.340
If they were,
we'd be dead already.

19:54.980 --> 19:55.970
What do I report?

19:56.150 --> 19:58.310
I already alerted Wegthor
Command that we stopped.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.400
I didn't ask you
to call it in.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.730
Wegthor Command,
this is Faora One-Three Actual.

20:03.950 --> 20:05.480
Ignore prior comm blast.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.990
Hostiles not found.
Civilians only. Over.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.870
<i>Negative, Faora
One-Three. Orders are to proceed</i>

20:13.040 --> 20:14.410
<i>and blow the tunnel.</i>

20:14.580 --> 20:17.040
Command, I repeat,
civilians are danger close.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.710
We'll need to clear them out
and then blow the tunnel. Over.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.410
<i>Negative.
You have your orders.</i>

20:22.630 --> 20:24.540
Command, I wish to consult
Primus Lyta-Zod

20:24.720 --> 20:26.680
about modifying the order.
Over.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.220
<i>Faora One-Three, the
order came from Primus Zod.</i>

20:31.390 --> 20:32.720
<i>Over.</i>

20:33.730 --> 20:37.220
Kem, Stak,
let's open up a hole.

20:37.730 --> 20:38.600
Let's get those people out.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.230
That's not the order,
Commander.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.140
I'm not getting Reconditioned

20:43.320 --> 20:44.980
because you suddenly
felt noble.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.620
Move, Sergeant,
or try to stop me.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.520
<i>I knew before
Kem even told me,</i>

21:23.690 --> 21:25.280
<i>all those people were dead.</i>

21:25.450 --> 21:28.150
<i>Deemed a "calculated risk."</i>

21:28.280 --> 21:32.030
<i>The war, Lyta.
It was all messed up.</i>

21:32.240 --> 21:33.730
<i>And there was no room
for those of us</i>

21:33.950 --> 21:35.950
<i>trying to sort it out.</i>

21:36.170 --> 21:38.500
<i>Kem had said once,
"What choice do we have</i>

21:38.670 --> 21:40.450
<i>"but to fight?"</i>

21:40.670 --> 21:42.830
<i>So I chose that day
to never fight again.</i>

21:43.010 --> 21:44.120
Take this.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.500
<i>Kem told me where
to find this smuggler</i>

21:46.630 --> 21:48.170
<i>he'd been working with,</i>

21:48.300 --> 21:50.290
<i>bringing stuff up to Wegthor
from Krypton</i>

21:50.470 --> 21:52.960
<i>in a skimmer modified
for space flight.</i>

21:53.100 --> 21:54.960
<i>Said the guy could get me back
to Kandor,</i>

21:55.140 --> 21:56.630
<i>off the radar,</i>

21:57.350 --> 21:59.850
<i>so I left, alone.</i>

22:00.860 --> 22:02.940
<i>I deserted the Sagitari.</i>

22:04.990 --> 22:06.520
<i>But before I could disappear,</i>

22:06.650 --> 22:09.190
<i>I had to talk to her
face to face.</i>

22:09.410 --> 22:12.650
<i>I needed to look her
in the eyes to know the truth.</i>

22:13.370 --> 22:14.230
Lyta?

22:14.950 --> 22:15.790
Dev.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.450
What're you doing here?

22:20.080 --> 22:22.170
You've been reported AWOL.
If you're seen--

22:22.380 --> 22:23.870
Report me if you must.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.330
I--I want to help you,

22:27.510 --> 22:29.220
but I'm in
a very difficult position.

22:29.430 --> 22:31.670
If you wanted to help me,
you would've killed that order

22:31.850 --> 22:33.680
instead of innocent civilians.

22:34.140 --> 22:36.970
We could've done the job
and saved them.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.600
The Lyta I love would have.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.590
Then why are you back here,
Dev?

22:41.770 --> 22:43.060
To chastise me?

22:43.190 --> 22:46.150
Those months
I waded through shit.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.100
Stepped over death
and its endless piles

22:48.240 --> 22:50.190
of lost potential.
I drank from nothing

22:50.360 --> 22:52.950
but puddles filtered of blood.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.910
I did all of it.
I endured it.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.030
Because I believed in you,
Lyta.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.250
But now all I see is your son
and his will.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.590
I want to thank you, Lyta,

23:06.710 --> 23:08.670
for the light you gave my life,

23:08.840 --> 23:11.050
but I want nothing to do
with you anymore.

23:15.850 --> 23:18.060
Should the Sagitari
find you,

23:18.390 --> 23:22.850
even if I wanted to help,
I can't.

23:23.230 --> 23:24.350
I know.

23:27.530 --> 23:28.730
I know.

23:33.450 --> 23:36.690
After that I left Kandor
and found New Lurvan.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.610
I know it's all true.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.040
But I can't give up on her.

23:46.130 --> 23:48.710
I have to believe that Lyta

23:48.880 --> 23:51.590
can still be saved from Zod.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.880
I've looked in Lyta's eyes.

23:54.090 --> 23:58.550
The mercy and compassion
she retained, it's eroded away.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.680
If I'm to join you against Zod
and Lyta gets in the way,

24:02.900 --> 24:05.430
I need to know
what you're willing to do.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.900
I...

24:12.660 --> 24:15.070
I honestly don't know.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.900
But I'll listen, to you, Dev.

24:19.370 --> 24:23.110
You have followed me
for a very long time.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.080
From now on, we walk together.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.640
To see you holding
your child, my brother,

24:46.810 --> 24:48.020
in your arms,

24:48.190 --> 24:50.310
brings me more joy
than you could know.

24:50.820 --> 24:51.980
It's good to have you back.

24:54.030 --> 24:54.990
Is it?

24:55.570 --> 24:58.110
Because when I heard
that you destroyed

24:58.240 --> 24:59.820
my grandfather's
Phantom Projector,

24:59.950 --> 25:01.610
thereby trapping me
in the Phantom Zone,

25:01.750 --> 25:03.280
I really didn't know
what to think.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.990
Oh, I do apologize for that.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.950
But I don't regret my decision.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.960
You know it was
necessary to stop Brainiac

25:10.130 --> 25:11.540
and protect Krypton.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.500
And where is Brainiac now?

25:16.340 --> 25:17.420
Dead.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.050
You killed Brainiac?

25:27.350 --> 25:30.390
Then I have never been more
proud to be your son.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.930
I always had confidence that
you would escape Brainiac

25:35.110 --> 25:36.400
and the Phantom Zone.

25:36.700 --> 25:40.860
Farfetched, I know,
but I chose to believe in you

25:41.040 --> 25:42.280
and your love for Krypton.

25:42.910 --> 25:45.450
It wasn't my love for Krypton
that saved me.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.950
It was Lyta.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.710
I saw her in the Phantom Zone,
you know.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.760
Being strangled
to death by you.

25:57.260 --> 25:58.470
A vision.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.460
One of the many
mysterious treacheries

26:00.640 --> 26:02.300
of that horrific place.

26:02.510 --> 26:04.930
Well, this one told me that
Lyta won't be in lock-step

26:05.100 --> 26:06.470
with you forever.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.310
Lyta knows
what's best for Kandor,

26:09.900 --> 26:12.100
and she can see
what you cannot.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.570
This is my vision for Krypton.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.020
The universe.

26:22.870 --> 26:25.240
You and I waste time
quarreling,

26:25.410 --> 26:26.870
when we could be building,

26:27.040 --> 26:29.580
like the Els
and the Zods of the past.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.830
When the houses of our family
work together,

26:33.050 --> 26:35.910
we create greatness
that sustains Krypton.

26:36.090 --> 26:37.630
The Els and the Zods.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.580
Our capacity to create
is only rivaled

26:40.760 --> 26:43.420
by our ability to destroy,
you know this true.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.340
Look, what I saw
in the Phantom Zone,

26:45.520 --> 26:47.300
it might be real
or it might not.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.220
I just know there is a version
of the future

26:49.390 --> 26:50.930
where you go too far,

26:51.110 --> 26:54.560
where all of this goes too far.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.360
Please, my son,

26:58.990 --> 27:03.480
you have a chance to be
the best of both houses.

27:05.740 --> 27:06.980
No, Seg.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.120
You do.

27:11.420 --> 27:15.130
You can end this war.
Reunite Krypton.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.300
Help Lyta broker peace
with Val.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.580
Convince him to embrace
both houses of our family.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.930
United,

27:24.350 --> 27:27.630
we can build
a tomorrow we all want.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.980
But in the meantime,
I will arrange for the Med Bay

27:31.150 --> 27:34.760
at Fort Rozz to see you and get
you checked out and cleaned up.

27:35.770 --> 27:38.360
The Phantom Zone
can be wearing, I know.

27:49.410 --> 27:52.120
Keep your eye on that
Sagitari over there.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.750
Kem?

27:54.960 --> 27:56.330
- Kem.
- Adam?

27:56.550 --> 27:57.830
I thought you were dead.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.590
I mean, I--close,
I was in Detroit.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.590
I mean, a bottled Detroit,
but, you know, in the future.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.420
Obviously.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.760
Hey, about Ona,

28:06.890 --> 28:09.050
I'm really sorry, there was--

28:09.220 --> 28:10.390
there was nothing
that I could do.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.300
Listen.
I made peace with it.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.180
It took some time,

28:16.360 --> 28:18.350
but you saved mine
and Seg's life.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.730
Well, there's that.

28:22.110 --> 28:23.850
Hey, Adam, um,

28:24.030 --> 28:25.360
there's something you
need to know about Seg--

28:25.530 --> 28:27.860
Seg?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.120
Seg is alive.

28:29.330 --> 28:30.660
I found him on
Brainiac's home planet.

28:30.830 --> 28:32.620
He's in Kandor as we speak.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.750
That--that's amazing.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.410
Hey, it's all right.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.840
This war's gonna be over, bud.

28:43.010 --> 28:47.420
Hey, if anyone can defeat Zod,
it's Seg and me.

28:47.970 --> 28:49.180
I'll do whatever
I can to help.

28:49.350 --> 28:50.210
Whatever I can.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.800
You know what?
There actually might be a way.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.680
Val's got me
on this top secret mission

28:53.850 --> 28:55.560
to take control
of the Space Elevator.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.720
We need a Sagitari
bio-scanned access

28:57.900 --> 29:00.560
through a utility tunnel,
and that could be you.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.930
Huh?
Are you in?

29:03.530 --> 29:05.770
Uh, I mean,

29:05.950 --> 29:08.280
I want to, but I just kind of
plan to sit here

29:08.450 --> 29:09.240
in this filthy tunnel.

29:09.450 --> 29:10.860
Yes! Yes, I am in.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.440
Just get me out of here.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.160
Okay, I'm gonna go talk to
Val and Jax

29:14.370 --> 29:15.410
about folding you in,
all right?

29:15.580 --> 29:16.740
Shit's gonna get dicey.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.910
A lot of ways
it could go sideways.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.920
So, we'll probably die.
Later today.

29:22.550 --> 29:25.380
Certain death wouldn't
and didn't stop Seg.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.300
And it is not gonna stop me,
probably.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.840
I think.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.630
- Stay there.
- Yeah.

29:32.850 --> 29:34.140
Good to see you.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.600
I can assure you,
my head's completely fine.

29:42.820 --> 29:44.560
Haven't had any weird
nightmares lately.

29:44.740 --> 29:46.190
Certainly haven't had my mind
hijacked recently,

29:46.360 --> 29:48.200
or I think so.

29:48.780 --> 29:51.650
Oh, good, all clear?
Well, that's a relief.

29:51.830 --> 29:54.160
Not that I was worried
or anything.

29:54.330 --> 29:55.660
I'll be back.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.340
Raika?

30:19.940 --> 30:21.470
Raika, what're you doing here?

30:24.070 --> 30:26.980
Raika, it's me. Seg?

30:28.530 --> 30:29.900
You remember me, right?

30:30.700 --> 30:32.910
No. I'm very busy.
I'm sorry.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.990
Oh, no, Raika, from--
from the catacombs--

30:35.500 --> 30:36.990
- Whoa.
- No, no.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.780
- No, no.
- It's okay.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.240
- No! No, no.
- Okay, okay.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Well, calm down.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.290
- Raika? Raika.
- No, no.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.080
Raika, be calm, be calm.
Calm down, Raika.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.050
- No, no...
- Raika, what's happening?

30:47.170 --> 30:48.540
- What's happening to her?
- Not sure.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.880
No! No.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.850
We'll get her over
to the Somatic Division.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.800
Calm her mind.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.890
She's a friend.
I'll take her.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.480
- You're not authorized.
- Do you know who I am?

31:07.070 --> 31:08.180
I am Seg-El,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.270
father of the savior
of Krypton, General Zod.

31:11.450 --> 31:13.990
So I suggest you find someone
to authorize it,

31:14.160 --> 31:16.030
and also I want the best tech
you have to see her,

31:16.240 --> 31:17.480
is that clear?

31:17.660 --> 31:19.150
Or maybe you'd like me
to tell my son.

31:19.330 --> 31:21.990
- No, no, we'll set it up.
- Thank you.

31:22.130 --> 31:25.790
Now, how do we get there
from here?

31:26.710 --> 31:29.130
Val, I need to speak
to you urgently.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.460
It's about Jax.

31:34.430 --> 31:36.420
I got this intel
from an old friend,

31:36.640 --> 31:38.050
a commander working closely
with Jax.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.140
I brought it straight to you.

31:39.310 --> 31:40.850
It's a smart weapon.

31:41.020 --> 31:43.810
Linked to the Codex
and its genetic index.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.510
This bio-weapon can target
and shut down

31:46.730 --> 31:48.940
specific DNA signatures
on a massive scale.

31:49.110 --> 31:50.600
If the wrong hands
got hold of it--

31:50.780 --> 31:52.360
It could mean genocide.

31:52.530 --> 31:55.520
A single miscalculation could
destroy everyone on Krypton.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.030
That's why I came to you,
Val.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.740
Help me stop it
before it's too late.

32:12.220 --> 32:14.170
Genetic signatures primed.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.760
Weapon is armed.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.180
Detonate on my command only.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.810
Understood?

32:26.980 --> 32:28.890
Who will we be targeting?

32:30.530 --> 32:33.320
Every Sagitari in Wegthor,
if necessary.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.020
Tell no one about it.

33:06.230 --> 33:08.850
Word is you're
the best tech in here.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.400
You know, I've never sat in
for one of these before.

33:14.610 --> 33:15.850
Her memories just appear there?

33:16.530 --> 33:17.440
Correct.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.700
And, uh, you can access
the memory files of anyone

33:19.870 --> 33:23.280
you've Reconditioned just
right here on that display?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.830
Yes, but what's that
have to do with her?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.240
No, nothing.
I was just wondering.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.670
Search for Lyta Zod.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.720
<i>At a certain point,</i>

33:49.900 --> 33:51.890
<i>you will feel like you're
going to die.</i>

33:54.240 --> 33:58.480
<i>But I promise
you will survive.</i>

33:58.660 --> 33:59.820
Stop.

34:03.290 --> 34:06.900
Um, search...

34:07.080 --> 34:09.070
"Reconditioning files,
Lyta Zod."

34:09.880 --> 34:11.460
<i>Not found.</i>

34:12.380 --> 34:14.000
Search again.
Search...

34:14.170 --> 34:16.540
"Primus Zod,
Reconditioning files."

34:17.340 --> 34:18.460
<i>Not found.</i>

34:34.480 --> 34:35.969
Boo.
You okay?

34:36.150 --> 34:40.320
Yeah, just, um, not a fan
of being underground.

34:47.909 --> 34:50.080
Move fast and don't die.

34:51.460 --> 34:54.500
- That was an awful pep talk.
- Who was that?

34:56.630 --> 34:58.120
You know, I've used
some blasters in my day.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.710
If you need some tips,
you can--

34:59.880 --> 35:00.870
Say, you know what?

35:01.050 --> 35:03.210
I think I'll manage.
Thank you.

35:09.940 --> 35:13.730
<i>When this is over,
you'll be a different person.</i>

35:13.900 --> 35:16.610
<i>You won't even remember
this conversation.</i>

35:19.650 --> 35:20.740
Stop.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.910
This is unfortunate, Seg.

35:32.540 --> 35:33.950
What have you done?

35:35.630 --> 35:37.250
I helped free her mind
of conflict.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.210
Relieved her of thoughts

35:39.380 --> 35:41.920
and memories that impeded
her potential,

35:42.090 --> 35:43.830
so she could more clearly
see my vision.

35:44.010 --> 35:47.550
What have you done?

35:48.640 --> 35:50.300
I relished no part of it.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.030
I hoped you'd remain
unblemished

36:07.790 --> 36:10.370
and come to understand me
on your own.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.030
In time,

36:13.790 --> 36:15.580
maybe even love me.

36:16.420 --> 36:18.750
It's a shame
that we'll never know.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.260
I'm sorry, Father.

36:26.390 --> 36:27.840
Full Recondition.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.020
Move up, move up.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.080
All right, so what's
this barrier look like?

36:57.250 --> 36:58.490
I think I found it.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.500
Okay.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.040
- Shiny.
- Huh.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.800
Here we go.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.890
Sorry if we die.

37:16.350 --> 37:18.770
Sorry if we die.
Just... Yeah.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.430
- It's a joke.
- Yeah.

37:20.610 --> 37:21.770
A bad joke.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.320
See? I think that's fine.

37:29.490 --> 37:30.860
So what we have to--

37:31.040 --> 37:32.400
- <i>Breach detected.</i>
- Uh...

37:32.580 --> 37:33.570
<i>Breach detected.</i>

37:33.790 --> 37:35.070
Kem, let's not embarrass me

37:35.250 --> 37:36.240
in front of our new friends
here, yeah?

37:36.420 --> 37:37.660
Yeah, hold on.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.540
- What is that thing?
- It's a data scrambler.

37:41.710 --> 37:44.460
- What does it do?
- It scrambles data!

37:44.630 --> 37:47.420
And it confuses tech,
and I'm hoping that

37:47.590 --> 37:50.760
if I click this button,
it...

37:50.930 --> 37:52.300
<i>Access granted.</i>

37:52.430 --> 37:55.220
Lets us through the barrier.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.430
Well done.

38:00.610 --> 38:04.350
"Oh, Kem, you saved the day.
You should be commander."

38:09.820 --> 38:12.570
Reconditioning complete.
He's done.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.910
Take him to recovery.
I'll see what we deleted here.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.750
<i>Can you hear me, Seg-El?</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:30.300
What is this?

39:30.740 --> 39:32.230
There it is,
the access terminal.

39:32.410 --> 39:33.520
Get through that,

39:33.700 --> 39:36.110
we're into the Space Elevator
base station.

39:39.790 --> 39:41.530
<i>Strike team
has reached the base station.</i>

39:41.920 --> 39:44.200
<i>Ground forces, move in.</i>

39:59.640 --> 40:02.480
Strike team, ground support
is within artillery range.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.060
- What is your sit-rep?
- <i>Stand by.</i>

40:05.570 --> 40:07.230
<i>Verifying sequence.</i>

40:09.240 --> 40:10.440
<i>Sequence failed.</i>

40:10.990 --> 40:12.320
<i>It's a negative,
Rebel Command.</i>

40:12.450 --> 40:13.810
<i>The key is inoperable.</i>

40:13.990 --> 40:16.070
<i>I repeat,
the key does not work.</i>

40:16.530 --> 40:17.520
No.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.320
No, there's something wrong
out there.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.800
Why are the bio-readouts
showing depleted oxygen levels?

40:30.090 --> 40:32.460
<i>Oxygen level...</i>

40:34.090 --> 40:35.930
<i>Oxygenator O2 levels...</i>

40:39.140 --> 40:40.800
The oxygenators are failing.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.470
They're suffocating out there.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.810
Zod's tainted the supply.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.400
He's been playing us.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.810
<i>Oxygenator
O2 levels depleted.</i>

40:52.990 --> 40:54.770
<i>Oxygenator O2 levels
depleted.</i>

40:54.950 --> 40:57.360
- <i>Depleted.</i>
- <i>Depleted.</i>

40:57.530 --> 40:58.490
<i>Depleted.</i>

41:09.550 --> 41:11.080
Commander,

41:12.510 --> 41:15.040
detonate the Codex Weapon.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.050
<i>We have lost
all ground support.</i>

41:18.220 --> 41:22.010
<i>I repeat,
ground support are dead.</i>

41:22.640 --> 41:23.800
Copy that.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.350
What did she mean,
"Detonate the Codex Weapon"?

41:31.530 --> 41:32.890
Is that what that thing is?

41:33.440 --> 41:34.310
There's no time to explain.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.070
Well, make time.

41:37.490 --> 41:38.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.370
One step further
and I'll drop you.

41:43.540 --> 41:44.570
What is it?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.410
A genetic bio-weapon
that's linked to the Codex,

41:47.920 --> 41:50.580
programmed to wipe out every
last Sagitari on Wegthor.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.000
- Sorry, Kem.
- What?

41:54.170 --> 41:55.210
No, no!

42:02.180 --> 42:04.470
<i>Rebel Command,
the detonator has failed.</i>

42:04.640 --> 42:07.010
<i>I repeat,
the detonator has failed.</i>

42:07.190 --> 42:08.270
No.

42:08.980 --> 42:09.850
No!

42:18.280 --> 42:20.400
You left me no choice.

42:21.910 --> 42:23.320
Val.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.200
Where's the Codex?

42:26.370 --> 42:28.990
You should've told me
what you were planning to do.

42:29.170 --> 42:30.950
Val, what did you do?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.620
What did you do?

42:43.470 --> 42:44.840
What do you think
you're gonna do?

42:45.020 --> 42:46.720
We've come this far,
we need to finish this.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.390
Ground support is dead.
We won't make it out.

42:51.730 --> 42:52.560
I know.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.660
What the hell is this?

43:09.370 --> 43:11.210
The end of the war.
