00:42.880 --> 00:44.880
Now is the time.
This is the hour.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.880
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.880
Now is the time.
This is the hour.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.880
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.880
THE CRAFT

02:11.880 --> 02:13.880
Move your seat
to the upright position, please.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Come on. Let's go.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Come on, darling.
The taxi's waiting.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.880
Oh, yeah.
It's a lot drier in here, Dad.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.880
Oh, God.
We need a new roof.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.880
Yeah. But it's big.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.880
I like the peg-and-groove floors.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.880
Damask curtains
would look really nice.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.880
-Yeah. Gotta get this roof fixed, honey.
-Yeah.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.880
I found this out back.
You want it?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.880
Relax. What's the matter with you?

04:43.880 --> 04:45.880
- Dad!
- What? What is it?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.880
What the--
Get the hell out of here!

04:51.880 --> 04:53.880
What the hell?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.880
Sarah, you all right?

04:55.880 --> 04:58.880
Yeah, I'm fine.
He just surprised me, that's all.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.880
Yeah, I guess.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.880
Are you sure?

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.880
You could wait--
just until you got a school uniform.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.880
You don't have to go now.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.880
I can't stay home and watch daytime TV
for the rest of my life.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.880
Why not? I could.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.880
I just want to get started
and get it over with.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.880
- You look good. Good luck.
- Thanks.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.880
-Jenny'll pick you up.
- I'll walk.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.880
- You sure?
- Yeah.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.880
Hey, scary bitch alert.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
Oh, God! I thought it was Satan.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.880
Jesus Christ. She looking?

06:23.880 --> 06:24.880
- Oh, God.
- Oh, she's looking.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.880
Okay, I'll find a warm place--
safe, warm place.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.880
The almanac says today will bring
an arrival of something.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.880
Yeah, wonderful.
I'm getting my rag.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.880
A new wholeness,
and with it a new balance.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.880
Earth, air, water, fire.''

06:44.880 --> 06:46.880
Maybe it's our fourth.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.880
We don't need a fourth.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.880
Nancy, we need someone
to call out the corners--

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
north, south, east and west.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.880
Four would make a circle.

06:54.880 --> 06:55.880
Maybe she can be our fourth.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.880
I love a woman in uniform.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.880
Bonjour, class.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.880
What?

07:37.880 --> 07:40.880
Oh, you mean did I get laid?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.880
Beaucoup de laid.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.880
What is that snail trail over there
saying about me?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.880
You know, this is LA.
We should be learning Mexican.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.880
That would be Spanish, genius.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.880
She's here.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.880
- She who?
- Someone to be the fourth.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
She's the one.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.880
You feeling okay?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.880
That's her.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.880
Hi. Do you guys mind
if I sit with you?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.880
'Cause I'm supposed to find
a lab group.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.880
Okay.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.880
No, you can sit here.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.880
Happy?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.880
What?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.880
- You're Sarah, right?
- Yeah.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
Hi. I'm Chris.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.880
I just wanted to apologize
for those guys in French.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
They're assholes.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.880
You know what they say.
You are what you hang with.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.880
Yeah, right.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.880
Wait. Did you just
call me an asshole?

10:06.880 --> 10:09.880
- You did, didn't you?
- I'm sorry. My defenses are up.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.880
People here have been
really rude to me.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.880
Really? Who else?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.880
These three girls.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.880
They're behind you.
Don't stare.

10:21.880 --> 10:22.880
That's slick.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.880
Oh, shit.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.880
It's the bitches of Eastwick.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.880
- What?
- Whatever you do, stay away from them.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.880
- Why?
- You see the one on the right?

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
She's a major slut.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.880
I don't know from experience
or anything, but--

10:39.880 --> 10:44.880
And the one in the middle,
she's got burn scars all over her body.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.880
I haven't seen them,
but friends of mine have.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
Anyway, they're--

10:48.880 --> 10:50.880
Nah. Never mind.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
What?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.880
They're witches.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.880
Witches?

10:57.880 --> 10:59.880
That's what people say.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.880
So what are you doing
after school?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.880
I don't know.
Nothing, I guess.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.880
- Really?
- Really.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.880
I'm busy.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.880
Football practice.
You can come and watch.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.880
Football practice.
That is so tempting.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
Looking for someone?

11:52.880 --> 11:54.880
Some of these football dicks
make their girlfriends...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.880
come and watch them practice,
as if it's interesting.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.880
Yeah, like, girlfriend, over there--
Chris Hooker.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.880
I don't even know him.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.880
Nancy's sorry about what happened
in biology.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.880
And she's mean to everybody,
so don't take it personally.

12:09.880 --> 12:10.880
You're Nancy?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.880
She's Nancy, I'm Bonnie
and that's Rochelle.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.880
- Hi. I'm Sarah.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.880
Do you want to go for coffee?

12:20.880 --> 12:23.880
No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for--

12:24.880 --> 12:26.880
You can make something up.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.880
Rochelle's ditching practice.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.880
He comes on to anything
with tits, Sarah.

12:33.880 --> 12:34.880
Except me.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.880
I'm not watching him.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.880
He spreads disease.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.880
I speak from personal experience.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.880
Whoa, Chris! Go long!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.880
Go for the pass, baby!

12:53.880 --> 12:54.880
He's a jerk.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Come on.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.880
- So you're coming, right?
- Where are we going?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.880
Shopping.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.880
Come on.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.880
I don't have any money.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.880
We get a five-finger discount.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.880
Five-finger discount.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.880
Sarah, where'd you live before?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.880
San Francisco.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.880
- Why'd you move?
- 'Cause it sucks.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.880
My dad wanted to.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.880
- Sucks here too.
- I know. You need a car here.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.880
You need a car everywhere.

13:31.880 --> 13:32.880
What's up with that?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.880
I slit my wrists.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.880
Sorry.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.880
What'd you do it with?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.880
With a kitchen knife.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.880
You even did it the right way.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.880
Yeah.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
Punk rock. Let's go.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.880
The right way  ?
How do you know the right way?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.880
Shut up, Rochelle.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.880
How do you know?

14:33.880 --> 14:34.880
What?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.880
Put this in your bag.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.880
No.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.880
Everything in nature steals,
you know.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.880
Big animals steal from little ones.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.880
They steal for survival.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.880
- Besides, I already have a diary.
- This is different.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.880
You put spells
and power thoughts in it...

14:50.880 --> 14:53.880
and then you don't let anyone else
read it, ever.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.880
Except maybe us.

14:55.880 --> 14:56.880
Here.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
You guys are really
into all this?

15:01.880 --> 15:03.880
Sort of.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.880
That's not for you.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.880
I'm sorry.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.880
What a beautiful ring.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.880
It was your mother's.

15:26.880 --> 15:27.880
Yeah, it was.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.880
Are you going to pay for those?

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
Uh-huh.

15:33.880 --> 15:34.880
You're not like your friends.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.880
You know how to use candles?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
Yeah. You light the wick.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.880
More than that.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.880
Red is for love.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.880
Black--
Actually--

15:53.880 --> 15:55.880
Why you don't read that?

15:55.880 --> 15:58.880
- It explains it all.
- Okay.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.880
Twenty dollars.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.880
You know, I've never read
anything about this stuff before.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.880
I mean, I don't follow it.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.880
Maybe you're a natural witch.
Your power comes from within.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.880
Come on, Sarah.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.880
You guys, I think
I should head home.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.880
Just look straight ahead
and keep up.

16:33.880 --> 16:34.880
Please? My baby needs some food.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
- I don't have anything.
- Don't give them money.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.880
- You're gonna get nailed.
- I don't have anything.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.880
I know you.
I have another snake for you.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.880
Wait a second.
I have to talk to you.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
I had a dream about you.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.880
In my dream, you were dead.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.880
I'm talking to you.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.880
Come back to Jesus, child.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.880
- Don't you run away from me!
- I am the door, the way--

17:03.880 --> 17:05.880
I know what I'm talking about!

17:05.880 --> 17:07.880
I'm in touch with the man!

17:12.880 --> 17:14.880
Listen to me!

17:23.880 --> 17:25.880
Come on, Sarah.
Let's get out of here.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.880
Oh, my God!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.880
What is it? Do you think
there's anybody back there?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.880
It hit him. The car hit him,
and we made it happen.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.880
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Definitely.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.880
I thought to myself,
It's gonna hit him.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.880
- I thought it too.
- Sarah, did you think it?

17:48.880 --> 17:51.880
- Yeah.
- Then that's it. Sarah's the fourth.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.880
North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.880
- This is it. This is real.
- Shit.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.880
You guys, this is really weird.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.880
Well, I mean, he was after you.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
He was gonna hurt you, man.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.880
It's not our fault.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.880
You guys,
maybe he'll really listen now.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
Who?

18:10.880 --> 18:11.880
Manon.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.880
What's that?
That's like God?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.880
No. Man invented God.
This is older than that.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.880
Do you guys worship the devil?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.880
It's like God and the devil.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
I mean, it's everything.

18:25.880 --> 18:31.880
It's the trees, it's the ground,
it's the rocks, it's the moon.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
It's nature.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.880
If God and the devil
were playing football...

18:36.880 --> 18:39.880
Manon would be the stadium
that they played on.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.880
It would be the sun
that shone down on them.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.880
So, does stuff like tonight
happen to you a lot?

18:45.880 --> 18:48.880
No. Not like that.

18:48.880 --> 18:49.880
Other stuff.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.880
Where did you learn it?

18:51.880 --> 18:52.880
I don't know.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.880
A natural witch.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.880
I hate it.
It's always getting screwed up.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.880
It's like, sometimes
I'll want it to rain...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.880
and a pipe will burst in my room
and it'll just get flooded.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.880
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.880
Or I'll want it
just to be quiet...

19:10.880 --> 19:15.880
and I'll wish for it, and I'll go deaf
for three days straight.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.880
If you can do that...

19:17.880 --> 19:19.880
have you ever heard
of invoking the spirit?

19:22.880 --> 19:24.880
It's when you call him.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.880
Manon.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.880
It's like--

19:31.880 --> 19:34.880
It's like you take him
into you.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
It's like he fills you.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.880
He takes everything
that's gone wrong in your life...

19:41.880 --> 19:44.880
and he makes it all better again.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.880
Nothing makes everything
all better again.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
Maybe not foryou.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.880
Where are you going?

19:57.880 --> 19:59.880
You guys are freaking me out.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.880
Oh, she's scared.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.880
Nancy, we need her.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.880
Like a hole in the head.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.880
She'll be back.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.880
You sounded strange
when I called last night.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.880
- I didn't think you'd come.
- No, just surprised.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.880
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
I thought you'd be hanging out
with those girls.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.880
- What girls?
- Those girls with the weird heads.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.880
What's weird about their heads?

20:26.880 --> 20:29.880
That one girl,
she's got a mammoth head.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.880
Really?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.880
Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.880
I haven't noticed her.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.880
I hate that big head thing.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.880
'Course it's better
than that shrunken-head thing.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.880
Little, tiny-- Makes you want
to hang it from a rearview mirror.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.880
What is your obsession
with heads?

20:44.880 --> 20:47.880
I was just noticing
how great yours is.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.880
- You like my head?
- Yeah. It's a good head.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.880
- It's a good head?
- It's good.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.880
It looks good for kissing.
Can I?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.880
All right,
we'll see you later, bro.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.880
Nice meeting you, Sarah.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.880
Yeah. Bye.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.880
See you.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.880
Come on. Let's go to my house.
Nobody's there.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.880
I don't want to go.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.880
I can't.
I gotta go home.

21:13.880 --> 21:14.880
All right.

21:17.880 --> 21:18.880
Are you mad?

21:23.880 --> 21:24.880
I'm sorry.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.880
It's okay.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.880
So, hot stuff, how'd it go?

21:35.880 --> 21:38.880
- How'd what go?
- Your date with Chris.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
What are you talking about?

21:39.880 --> 21:42.880
Chris already told everybody.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.880
He told everybody what?

21:44.880 --> 21:46.880
That you guys did it.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.880
But we didn't do it.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.880
Maybe he was just trying
to save face then...

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
because...

21:55.880 --> 21:59.880
he's going around
the whole school saying that...

21:59.880 --> 22:02.880
you're the lousiest lay
he's ever had.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.880
And coming from him...

22:04.880 --> 22:05.880
that's pretty bad.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.880
- No, he didn't.
- He did.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.880
He said the same thing
about Nancy.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.880
Told you he was a jerk.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.880
Can I talk to you for a second?

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
I'm sorry.
Chris is really busy.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.880
Maybe we could set something up for--
nice jacket-- later in the week.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.880
What do you think?

22:40.880 --> 22:41.880
Why'd you lie about me?

22:43.880 --> 22:46.880
Look, I don't want to go out
with you again.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.880
Okay?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.880
Please stop begging.
It's pathetic.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.880
Fuck you.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.880
Nah.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.880
But I will.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.880
She's gonna cry,
and then I'm gonna cry.

23:07.880 --> 23:08.880
We're all gonna cry.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.880
Someone just doesn't want
to go in the pool.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.880
- Come on.
- This is a joke.

23:28.880 --> 23:29.880
I can't even believe this.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.880
Oh, wait. Here she goes.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
Shark!

23:50.880 --> 23:54.880
- Brilliant. Superb.
- Very good. It was great.

23:59.880 --> 24:03.880
Oh, God, look.
There is a pubic hair in my brush.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.880
Oh, no, wait. Wait.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.880
That's just one of Rochelle's
little nappy hairs.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.880
Why are you
doing this to me, Laura?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.880
Do you think you're funny?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
You really want to know why?

24:26.880 --> 24:29.880
Yes, I really want to know why.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.880
Because I don't like Negroids.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.880
Sorry.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.880
I've told you this before,
but I want to be really clear.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.880
This is a very
experimental procedure...

24:52.880 --> 24:55.880
and we can't make any warranties
regarding results or side effects.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.880
I can tell you unofficially
that there's little to no risk.

24:59.880 --> 25:03.880
With this form of gene therapy,
it's relatively noninvasive.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.880
It can be somewhat painful,
but noninvasive.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.880
Okay. Try to stay relaxed.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.880
I'm moving the armature
over you now.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.880
And you'll feel a little sting
when the needle penetrates.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.880
And then more
when the needle moves.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.880
I'll try and keep it
as brief as possible.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.880
Hold very still,
but keep breathing.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.880
Okay?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.880
Good. Keep your body relaxed.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.880
Just a little more, Bonnie.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.880
Don't move.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.880
Ray, the light's out!

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
Oh, man!

27:15.880 --> 27:20.880
You didn't even pay the bill.
I gave you the money.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.880
What are you doing home so late?
You're late!

27:23.880 --> 27:26.880
It's the storm, Grace.
It's the connection.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.880
- Oh, it's the storm?
- That's why the lights are out.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.880
Neighbor's lights aren't out.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.880
Got a light?

27:38.880 --> 27:40.880
I give you money.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.880
You tell me you pay the bill.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.880
You can't even pay a bill?

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
What are you good for?

27:46.880 --> 27:48.880
You know what I'm good for.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.880
We're going on a field trip.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.880
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt
your little social gathering.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.880
Sorry, Sister.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
You girls watch out
for those weirdos.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.880
We are the weirdos, mister.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.880
Earth, air, fire, water.
Earth, air, fire, water.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.880
It is better that you should
rush upon this blade...

29:24.880 --> 29:27.880
than enter the circle
with fear in your heart.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.880
How do you enter?

29:29.880 --> 29:31.880
With perfect love
and perfect trust.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.880
It is better that you should
rush upon this blade...

29:40.880 --> 29:43.880
than enter the circle
with fear in your heart.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.880
How do you enter?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.880
With perfect love
and perfect trust.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.880
It is better that you should
rush upon this blade...

29:58.880 --> 30:01.880
than enter the circle
with fear in your heart.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.880
How do you enter?

30:05.880 --> 30:08.880
With perfect love
and perfect trust.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.880
That's a girl.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.880
As above...

30:17.880 --> 30:19.880
so below.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.880
I drink of my sisters...

30:43.880 --> 30:46.880
and I ask for the ability...

30:46.880 --> 30:48.880
to not hate those
who hate me--

30:48.880 --> 30:50.880
especially racist pieces...

30:50.880 --> 30:53.880
of bleached-blonde shit
like Laura Lizzie.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.880
Right on.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.880
I drink of my sisters...

31:02.880 --> 31:05.880
and I ask to love myself more...

31:05.880 --> 31:09.880
and to allow myself
to be loved more by others--

31:10.880 --> 31:12.880
especially Chris Hooker.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.880
I know it's pathetic.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.880
Definitely pathetic.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.880
I drink of my sisters...

31:23.880 --> 31:28.880
and I take into myself
the power to be beautiful...

31:28.880 --> 31:30.880
outside as well as in.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.880
I drink of my sisters...

31:42.880 --> 31:45.880
and I take into myself...

31:49.880 --> 31:51.880
all the power of Manon.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
That's all?

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
Blessed be.

32:07.880 --> 32:08.880
Thought you were gonna burp.

32:10.880 --> 32:11.880
Oh, my God.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.880
What?

32:12.880 --> 32:14.880
Look.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.880
It's Manon.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.880
It's so beautiful.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.880
He's listening to us.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.880
- Do you think it's working?
- I don't know.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.880
I think he just looked at me.
Did he look at me? Is he looking?

33:01.880 --> 33:04.880
- Not right now, but he just did.
- So weird.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
I know. Now he's looking.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.880
- He's looking?
- Yes.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.880
Is he still back there?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.880
Yeah.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.880
Yeah?

33:19.880 --> 33:21.880
Never mind.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.880
It's working.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.880
That or he's gone
completely crazy.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.880
- You hate me, right?
- No.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.880
- You don't?
- No.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.880
'Cause, you see, when you're a guy--
and I am--

33:32.880 --> 33:34.880
people expect things.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.880
I mean, I know I said
some nasty things about you.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.880
- Did you tell your friends?
- What?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.880
That you're a lying sack of shit.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.880
No. But I will.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.880
I'll tell them tomorrow.
I'll tell the truth.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.880
Good.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.880
- Can I sit with you in Mass?
- Yeah, sure.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.880
Watch this.
Chris, could you carry these for me?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.880
- They're really heavy.
- Yeah.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.880
And Bonnie's too.
She's got a bad back.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.880
And this. Thanks.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
I can't believe it.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.880
Could you hold my jock for me?
It's kind of heavy.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.880
In the book of Genesis--

34:31.880 --> 34:33.880
What are you, Stepford boy?

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
Sit.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.880
Pay attention.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.880
It's working.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.880
Check it out.
Her spell is working.

34:57.880 --> 34:59.880
Nancy, oh, my God.
Would you look?

35:03.880 --> 35:05.880
Oh, great. Really bad.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.880
- Get one in, already.
- It's hard, you know.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.880
You're, like, two feet
away from each other.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.880
- Get off!.
- I'm not that heavy.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.880
Yeah, you're light
as a feather...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.880
during deep space travel.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.880
I am, actually.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.880
Did you ever play that game,
Light as a feather, stiffas a board  ?

35:27.880 --> 35:29.880
One girl lays down,
and you surround her...

35:29.880 --> 35:32.880
and you put your fingers
underneath.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.880
You put your fingers where?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.880
Okay.

35:37.880 --> 35:38.880
Now you take your index finger...

35:39.880 --> 35:40.880
and your middle finger...

35:41.880 --> 35:43.880
and you put it under her
like this.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.880
Now you have to imagine
that she's incredibly light...

35:49.880 --> 35:50.880
like she's made out of air.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.880
Now, is that her whole body,
or just her head?

35:53.880 --> 35:54.880
Cow.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.880
You guys, concentrate
or it's not gonna work.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.880
I think I sprained my finger.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.880
- Shut up!
- Focus!

36:07.880 --> 36:09.880
Come on, you guys.
Ready?

36:10.880 --> 36:12.880
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.880
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.880
Holy shit.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.880
You guys, it's not working.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.880
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.880
How do I get down?

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
Who's got the instructions?

37:24.880 --> 37:26.880
Just keep concentrating.

37:29.880 --> 37:30.880
Amazing.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.880
Hi. I got clean towels
for everyone.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.880
- Oh, my butt!
- What's going on in here?

37:42.880 --> 37:45.880
- Nothing. Why?
- Are you girls getting high?

37:49.880 --> 37:50.880
Are you okay?

37:52.880 --> 37:55.880
You gotta try it.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.880
So I say we all chip in for it.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.880
How much can you give?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.880
You pulled my hair out!

38:56.880 --> 38:59.880
Sorry. I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
Stupid bitch.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.880
- Laura really has split ends.
- Really?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.880
I guess this confirms
she's not a natural blonde.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.880
Bleach.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.880
What do you think
will happen to Laura?

39:21.880 --> 39:22.880
I don't know.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
If she leaves you alone,
nothing will happen to her.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.880
Nothing good.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.880
Fat chance.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.880
Who's that?

39:34.880 --> 39:36.880
That's my real mother.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
Where is she?

39:38.880 --> 39:40.880
She died when she was having me.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.880
Sorry.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
It's okay.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.880
Manon, take my scars.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.880
Give me beauty outside
as well as in.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.880
Manon, take my scars.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
Thank you.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.880
Don't hit your head on the board.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.880
Put a lid on it, Laura.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.880
Oh, my God.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.880
What? What happened?

40:57.880 --> 40:59.880
I don't know!
What does it look like?

40:59.880 --> 41:01.880
I don't know.
Hold still.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
Gross!

41:06.880 --> 41:09.880
- Is there a mark?
- Did you hit your head on something?

41:18.880 --> 41:20.880
Now, I want you to remember that
we may need to make several passes...

41:20.880 --> 41:22.880
before we can see any results.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.880
Is it better?

41:28.880 --> 41:30.880
I can't tell yet, dear.

41:41.880 --> 41:42.880
Just a minute.

41:44.880 --> 41:45.880
What does it look like?

41:49.880 --> 41:51.880
I don't know.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
Just wait.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.880
I can't believe it.

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
It worked.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.880
- What?
- It worked.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.880
'Cause seriously, if you
don't stop it, you can go blind.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.880
Hairy palms?

42:46.880 --> 42:48.880
She was supposed
to come back today.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.880
Did you talk to her?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.880
Principal Draper has called
a special assembly...

42:52.880 --> 42:55.880
during the second half
of the fifth per--

42:56.880 --> 42:58.880
Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.880
Sorry.
My pedicure ran late.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.880
- Wow.
- Holy shit.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.880
- Hi, Bonnie.
- How's it going?

43:11.880 --> 43:14.880
- Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
- My God.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.880
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe it.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.880
You did it.

43:20.880 --> 43:21.880
No, I didn't do it.

43:21.880 --> 43:24.880
- Yeah, you totally did it.
- I helped.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.880
Come on. You made Chris love you.
You own him.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.880
You made Laura Lizzie's hair
fall out.

43:29.880 --> 43:33.880
You guys should see her.
She has to wear a hat every day now.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.880
Poor Laura.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.880
What's wrong with Nancy?

43:39.880 --> 43:41.880
- Her spell's not working.
- What spell?

43:41.880 --> 43:45.880
I don't know. I think she doesn't want
to be white trash any more.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.880
And I told her,  "You're white, honey.
Just deal with it."

44:10.880 --> 44:12.880
Good.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.880
Okay. Come on, come on.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.880
- I can almost see through this thing.
- Leave me alone!

44:23.880 --> 44:25.880
- God!
-Jesus!

44:26.880 --> 44:27.880
You're supposed to act
like a father to the girl.

44:27.880 --> 44:31.880
- I ain't her father.
- Thank God.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.880
Her father's the one who paid you the
50 bucks for a bang in the back seat.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.880
Damn it!

44:38.880 --> 44:39.880
- Don't you ever hit me!
- Don't you touch her!

44:39.880 --> 44:41.880
Stop!

44:45.880 --> 44:47.880
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!

44:50.880 --> 44:52.880
Pig.

45:00.880 --> 45:01.880
Ray?

45:06.880 --> 45:08.880
Oxygen is flowing.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
What's happening?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.880
What's happening to him?

45:20.880 --> 45:23.880
I know this is a difficult time
for you...

45:23.880 --> 45:25.880
but it is procedure that I ask
just a few questions...

45:25.880 --> 45:29.880
before we can start processing
the policy.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
I don't understand.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.880
What policy?

45:32.880 --> 45:36.880
Mr. Saunders had a whole life
pension plan through the company...

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
and with benefits this size...

45:37.880 --> 45:39.880
it's standard that I--

45:39.880 --> 45:41.880
What size?

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
Just a second here.

45:47.880 --> 45:48.880
Sorry.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.880
$1 75,000.

45:58.880 --> 45:59.880
A hundred--

46:00.880 --> 46:04.880
Wait. Are you saying
that this goes to us?

46:04.880 --> 46:06.880
To you.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
A hundred and seventy-five--

46:09.880 --> 46:13.880
What a dear, sweet man.

46:23.880 --> 46:27.880
$175,000!

46:35.880 --> 46:37.880
I can't believe he's dead.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.880
- Do you think we killed him?
- No. Not at all.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.880
Now don't be shy, honey.

46:45.880 --> 46:46.880
Nice ass.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.880
- What? He has a cute butt.
- You're a slut.

46:49.880 --> 46:51.880
- Maybe you should go ask him out.
- You know it.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.880
Yeah.   I like your butt.
Do you want to have dinner?

47:01.880 --> 47:03.880
This is nice.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.880
Bedroom, bathroom, nightmare.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.880
You look so pretty. I'm so glad
you could come and see our apartment.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.880
Our apartment.
We have an apartment!

47:13.880 --> 47:16.880
And it's so big.
And look at this view.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.880
- It's beautiful.
- And the couch--

47:19.880 --> 47:22.880
This is our couch.
I love this couch.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
I saw it in the window and said,
I have to have this couch.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.880
And the guy, what an attitude.
I said,    Honey, wrap it up.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.880
I'm taking it right now.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
Cash!

47:33.880 --> 47:34.880
My juke box.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.880
Every song on here
is by Connie Francis.

47:45.880 --> 47:46.880
Yeah! Isn't that great?

47:46.880 --> 47:49.880
Ever since I was a little girl
I said...

47:49.880 --> 47:52.880
All I want in life is a juke box...

47:52.880 --> 47:55.880
that plays nothing
but Connie Francis records.''

47:55.880 --> 47:57.880
That's great.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.880
Who's Connie Francis?

47:59.880 --> 48:02.880
Oh, shut up, honey.
Listen and learn. Connie Francis.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.880
Can you come to my room, girls?

48:03.880 --> 48:06.880
- Let's go.
- It was nice to see you, Mrs. Downs.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.880
Connie Francis is--

48:08.880 --> 48:10.880
Wait a minute here.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.880
Let's have
a little house warming party.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.880
Sorry, Mom.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.880
This is cool.

48:21.880 --> 48:23.880
Ooh, nice.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.880
I was reading and I found something
I thought you guys might be into.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.880
Glamour. Throwing a glamour--

48:32.880 --> 48:35.880
an illusion so real
as to fool an onlooker--

48:35.880 --> 48:38.880
is one of the oldest forms
of magic.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.880
- Bet you I could do that.
- Do you think?

48:42.880 --> 48:44.880
This is to feel.

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
This is to be.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.880
Shape and form it...

48:51.880 --> 48:53.880
for all to see.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.880
By the power
of three times three...

48:58.880 --> 49:00.880
as I will it...

49:00.880 --> 49:03.880
so shall it be.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.880
What?

49:07.880 --> 49:08.880
My eyes are brown.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.880
They're usually green.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.880
You can do that with contacts.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.880
Yeah, but it's good.
I mean, it suits you.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.880
Subtle. But good.

49:22.880 --> 49:23.880
You want something bigger?

49:23.880 --> 49:26.880
- I want bigger.
- Bigger.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.880
We have to concentrate.
Come on.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.880
Ready?

49:48.880 --> 49:49.880
Are you impressed?

49:50.880 --> 49:52.880
- Yeah, I'm impressed!
- You look like Loni Anderson.

49:53.880 --> 49:54.880
- You want to touch it?
- Yeah.

49:56.880 --> 49:57.880
It's real!

49:57.880 --> 50:00.880
And so much simpler
than going to a salon.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.880
- Yeah, a really shitty salon.
- You try it.

50:03.880 --> 50:04.880
Wait. Watch.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.880
- Make me a blonde.
- Me, me, me.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.880
I don't think so.
No way.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.880
Do something to me.

50:17.880 --> 50:18.880
What do you want?

50:20.880 --> 50:21.880
A smaller ass.

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
Sarah!

50:32.880 --> 50:33.880
Sarah!

50:40.880 --> 50:43.880
Oh, no. No.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.880
Why didn't you answer the phone?

50:45.880 --> 50:48.880
It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.880
Oh, yeah, that's a good reason.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.880
You know what I was thinking?
Maybe we could move in together.

50:55.880 --> 50:59.880
I don't think I'm ready
for that kind of commitment right now.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.880
Oh, shit.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.880
It's just that I can't stop
thinking about you.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.880
I don't know why,
but I think I love you.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.880
I've never loved
anyone before, except...

51:09.880 --> 51:14.880
maybe my mom and this little puppy
I had when I was little.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.880
I think you should go home, Chris.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.880
No! Sarah, wait, please.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.880
Sarah, please. Look.

51:21.880 --> 51:25.880
I don't know what's happening to me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.880
Can I help you?

51:28.880 --> 51:30.880
No. Nobody can help me.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.880
Here again.
What can I do for you today?

51:41.880 --> 51:43.880
We need provisions.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.880
I need to undo a love spell.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.880
When you open a floodgate,
how do you undo it?

51:49.880 --> 51:53.880
You unleash something with a spell.
There is no undoing.

51:53.880 --> 51:55.880
It must run its course.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.880
You should let him suffer.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.880
It's not for you
to judge suffering.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.880
When do we find out
what's behind the curtain?

52:04.880 --> 52:08.880
What are you doing, hiding all
the missing kids from the neighborhood?

52:08.880 --> 52:10.880
What's there? Black magic?

52:11.880 --> 52:15.880
True magic is
neither black nor white.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.880
It's both
because nature is both.

52:17.880 --> 52:19.880
Loving and cruel,
all at the same time.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.880
The only good or bad
is in the heart of the witch.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.880
Life keeps a balance on its own.
You understand?

52:28.880 --> 52:29.880
Not really.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.880
Well, then understand this.

52:32.880 --> 52:35.880
Whatever you send out
you get back times three.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.880
Wait. We didn't read that
in any book.

52:38.880 --> 52:42.880
No, it's part of
a basic spiritual truth...

52:42.880 --> 52:44.880
said in many ways in many faiths.

52:44.880 --> 52:48.880
Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.880
I wanna buy this book.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.880
You want to invoke the spirit?

53:05.880 --> 53:08.880
You must be experienced to do this.
It's very dangerous.

53:08.880 --> 53:13.880
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay?
Now please just sell me the book.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.880
- How much?
- Twenty-five.

53:16.880 --> 53:17.880
What do you know?

53:19.880 --> 53:21.880
I have money.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.880
When things were
the worst for me...

54:23.880 --> 54:26.880
just before I tried
to kill myself...

54:27.880 --> 54:29.880
I used to hallucinate things.

54:29.880 --> 54:33.880
I'd close my eyes,
and all I would see were...

54:33.880 --> 54:36.880
snakes and bugs everywhere.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.880
Then I'd open them,
and they'd still be there.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.880
They wouldn't go away.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.880
They're everywhere.

54:44.880 --> 54:48.880
You know, the serpent
is a very powerful being.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.880
You should respect it.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.880
Aren't you powerful?
Yes, you are.

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
All right.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.880
Enough screwing around.

55:04.880 --> 55:07.880
Let's call the corners,
shall we?

55:15.880 --> 55:19.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the east...

55:19.880 --> 55:22.880
the powers of air and invention.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.880
Hear me!

55:24.880 --> 55:27.880
- Us!
- Hear us.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the south...

55:30.880 --> 55:32.880
powers of fire and feeling.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.880
Hear us.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the west...

55:36.880 --> 55:38.880
powers of water and intuition.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.880
Hear us.

55:40.880 --> 55:43.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

55:43.880 --> 55:46.880
by the powers of mother and earth.

55:46.880 --> 55:47.880
Hear us.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.880
Aid us in our magical working
on this May's eve.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.880
Serpent of old...

56:00.880 --> 56:02.880
ruler of deep...

56:02.880 --> 56:04.880
guardian of the bitter sea...

56:07.880 --> 56:08.880
show us your glory...

56:10.880 --> 56:11.880
show us your power.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.880
We pray of thee.

56:18.880 --> 56:19.880
We invoke thee.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.880
O serpent one, hear our calls.

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
Hear our prayers.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.880
Ancient wise one...

56:32.880 --> 56:34.880
teach us thy ways.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.880
We summon and stir thee.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.880
Lend us your powers.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.880
Show us your glory.

56:42.880 --> 56:45.880
We invoke thee!

56:49.880 --> 56:53.880
Manon, fill me!

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
Is he here?

57:57.880 --> 57:59.880
Did you feel that?

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
He blessed me.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.880
I can feel him
running through my veins.

58:09.880 --> 58:11.880
He's still in me.

58:13.880 --> 58:14.880
It's so amazing.

58:48.880 --> 58:50.880
Look at this.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.880
It's so beautiful.

58:58.880 --> 58:59.880
This is a gift.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.880
These are my gifts!

59:06.880 --> 59:08.880
I can feel you in me!

59:15.880 --> 59:17.880
I'm your daughter now.

59:19.880 --> 59:22.880
He's everywhere!
He's in everything!

59:23.880 --> 59:27.880
Listen, all I'm saying is
I think it's enough already.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.880
I don't know what's going on with this.
I'm completely humiliating Chris...

59:30.880 --> 59:33.880
when all I wanted
was for him to like me.

59:35.880 --> 59:37.880
And Bonnie,
what's going on with you?

59:37.880 --> 59:41.880
You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.

59:41.880 --> 59:44.880
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk
of my life being a monster.

59:44.880 --> 59:49.880
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good
time. Sorry if that bothers you.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.880
Can you guys tell me
what color that light is?

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
It's red.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.880
Doesn't red mean stop?

59:56.880 --> 59:59.880
Yeah, red does mean stop.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.880
It's like what Lirio was talking about--
throwing things out of balance.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.880
I know you thinkwe're getting
what we want now...

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.880
but it's going to come back
to us threefold.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Are we actually having
a theological conversation here?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880
I mean, it's fun, it's scary.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880
I mean, who gives a shit?

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880
Oh, Nancy, we do.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.880
What do you guys think?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.880
- They don't think.
- Bitch!

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.880
Stop trying to win them over,
because it won't work.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.880
I'm not trying to win them over.
You're paranoid.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.880
- I'm paranoid?
- Paranoid.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.880
I am not paranoid!

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.880
- Paranoid.
- Will you guys shut up!

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.880
Do you want in,
or do you want to leave this circle?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.880
Just tell me right now.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.880
Why must it always be
that way with you?

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.880
Because that's the way it is!

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.880
All I'm saying is,
I think you should think.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880
And I don't want out.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.880
One of these times,
the lights not gonna be green.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.880
Oh, waah!
We're scared, Sarah?

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.880
You scared, hmm?

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.880
That was actually pretty close.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.880
It just keeps falling out.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.880
I don't understand it.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.880
What did I do to deserve this?

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.880
Laura!

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.880
What's the matter?
What happened?

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880
I don't know.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.880
Calm down. Calm down.
It's okay.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.880
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay?
Stay right here.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880
Sarah, come on, please.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.880
You look like you need
to talk to someone anyways.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.880
How do you know what I look like?
We're talking on the phone.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.880
Look, it's important.
I just need to be alone with you.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.880
I have to see you.
I don't know why, but--

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Why are you being this way?
It's just dinner. Come on.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880
I don't know.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880
Please.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.880
Okay. Tomorrow night.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.880
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.880
- I'll see you then.
- Bye.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.880
So when I started hanging out
with them, I was almost relieved.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.880
I didn't have that many
close friends in San Francisco.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.880
It just felt really nice
to belong.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.880
I disagreed with them once,
and they turned their backs on me.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880
That's not friendship.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.880
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
- You do?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.880
Yeah. Sometimes it's like
we're one person. Know what I mean?

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.880
No, I'm not sure.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.880
I'm not sure either.
That's so funny.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.880
I was just thinking,
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.880
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant
or something like that?

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880
No.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880
All right. Look, Chris.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.880
I know you think you feel
really intensely...

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.880
but do you ever stop
and wonder where it comes from?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.880
I can't think.
I just feel.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.880
It's weird how it happened.
One day, I couldn't wait to see you.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.880
It's like that every day, but now
that I have you, I'm not letting go.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.880
Stop and think about what you're saying.
You don't even know me.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Here. I'll give you a back rub.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.880
I don't want a back rub.
I don't want you to. Just let go.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880
Just relax for a second.
Turn around.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.880
- I think you should take me home.
- No! Sarah, come on.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.880
- Take me home, okay?
-Just hold me, okay?

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
- Let go.
- Hold me first.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Fine. I'll walk.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.880
Goddamn it!

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.880
Sarah, get back--
Come back here.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.880
- Goddamn it!
- Please, Chris! Let go of my arm!

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Stay still!

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.880
No! Please!

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Let go!

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.880
Oh, my God.
Sarah, come here.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.880
What happened?

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.880
Are you okay?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.880
You should've seen
the look in his eyes.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880
It was so weird.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.880
They seemed empty,
like it wasn't even him.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.880
Where would he be?

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.880
There's a party.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.880
At Trey's.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.880
Just leave it alone.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.880
Don't go.
You're not going to help anything.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.880
I'm gonna go play.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.880
I cannot believe she's here.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880
You guys...

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.880
Nancy Downs is here.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880
Nancy?

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.880
I'm here. You're here.
We're all here.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Is Sarah with you?

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.880
What's going on?

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.880
Where is she?

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.880
You and me, we've had
some pretty good times together.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880
If I remember correctly...

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.880
we had some pretty hot times too.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.880
- Remember?
- I've been trying to forget.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.880
Forget?

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.880
- Did you forget this?
- Stop.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.880
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Not to get my dick bitten off.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.880
What makes you think
that's what I wanna do?

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880
Go away.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.880
Go away.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.880
What the--

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Surprise.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.880
Make love to me, Chris.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.880
We should not be here.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.880
Neither should Nancy.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Rochelle.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
How's it going?

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.880
Fine.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.880
Listen.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.880
You're a witch!

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.880
- They were right.
- They usually are.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.880
- Nancy, get off the bed. Let's go.
- She's a witch too.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.880
The only reason you're in love with her
is because she cast a spell on you.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.880
Yes. Sad, but true.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.880
That's why I'm here--
to help you forget about her.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.880
- What do you care?
- Nancy, get off the bed!

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.880
You scared the shit out of him.
Thank you very much. Let's go.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.880
No! He's gotta pay.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.880
You're just jealous.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.880
Jealous? Jealous?

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.880
You don't even exist to me!

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.880
You don't even exist.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880
You are nothing.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.880
You are shit.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.880
You don't exist.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.880
The only way you know how to treat
women is by treating them like whores!

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880
When you're the whore!

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.880
And that's gonna stop!

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.880
Do you understand?

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.880
Do you understand
what I'm saying, huh?

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
I'm sorry.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
He's sorry?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.880
Oh, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry!

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.880
Sorry, my ass!

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.880
I didn't want him to get hurt.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.880
I liked him.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.880
I think that he was
a good guy underneath it all.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.880
I didn't know
that it would go this far.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.880
- It was an accident.
- Dad, I need to be alone right now.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.880
- Please, honey, listen.
- Don't touch me!

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.880
Everything I touch turns to shit.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.880
I bind you
from doing harm, Nancy....

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.880
harm against other people...

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.880
and harm against yourself.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.880
I bind you
from doing harm, Nancy.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.880
Harm against other people...

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.880
and harm against yourself.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880
Stop it!

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880
Stop it!

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.880
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.880
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.880
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.880
Yeah. Well, I didn't
tell them anything.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.880
Then why do you want
to leave the circle?

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.880
- I didn't say--
- You don't need to say it.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.880
You're thinking it.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.880
Look, people are dead.
Chris and Ray are--

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.880
Those were accidents.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.880
- They deserved it.
- Says who?

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.880
Says me.
You know it's true.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880
Fine. Whatever. I'm out.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880
Fine. That's fine.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.880
We don't really need
a fourth anymore, do we?

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880
But if you're gonna leave
the circle...

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.880
you might want to think
about leaving the school.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.880
And maybe the city too.
We're not sure.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880
Or the planet.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.880
And please don't do
any more spells on me.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880
I didn't--

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.880
You know, in the old days...

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.880
if a witch betrayed her coven...

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.880
they would kill her.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.880
Bye!

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.880
Sweet dreams, Sarah.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.880
How have you been sleeping?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.880
Hello?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880
Yes?

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880
Hello.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.880
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.880
Oh, darling, what's wrong?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.880
I know I don't know you
very well...

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.880
but I just didn't know
where else to go.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.880
It's those girls
that I always come in here with.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.880
They're trying to use magic
against me.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.880
You don't understand.
They killed people.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.880
I tried to do a binding,
and it didn't work.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.880
And now, it's like everywhere I turn,
they're all around me.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.880
No matter what I do, they're still
there. I don't know what to do.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.880
You understand?
She's inside my dreams.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.880
She knows what's going on inside
my head. She can read my mind.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.880
I'm so sorry. I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.880
Please.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880
Come.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.880
What is this?

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.880
This temple is built
on a place of power.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.880
Sarah, you have
a tremendous light inside you...

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.880
more than any witch
I've ever known.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.880
You must not be afraid.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.880
I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.880
Do you hear
the voice of your mother?

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.880
What about her?

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.880
She's telling you to be strong.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.880
She was a witch, too, of course.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880
Didn't you know?

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880
You can defeat
those who challenge you...

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.880
but you must surrender yourself...

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.880
to the higher power.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.880
You must invoke the spirit.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.880
But it made Nancy crazy.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.880
She takes it to a dark place.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.880
- Don't be afraid. Invoke him.
- I can't.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.880
There is no other way.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north--

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.880
It's Nancy.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.880
I can't stay here.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880
No, Sarah! Stop! Sarah!

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880
Hello?

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880
Dad!

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.880
Jenny!

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.880
- Hello?
- They're gone.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.880
They flew back to San Francisco.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.880
They thought you ranaway
back home.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.880
Look, Sarah...

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.880
there's been an accident, man.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880
What are you talking about?

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.880
- What?
- It's been allover the news.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Go look at your TV.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.880
Wreckage from the plane was scattered
over a one-mile square area.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.880
Authorities suspect
severe wind shear...

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.880
may have been responsible
for today's tragedy.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.880
FAA officials have retrieved
the blackbox...

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.880
and a full investigationi spending.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.880
Onceagain,
Global flight 321...

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.880
from Los Angeles to San Francisco
has crashed with no survivors.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.880
More on this story
as details become available.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880
Oh, my God.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.880
Please. Please stop it.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.880
Stop it!

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880
Stop it!

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880
Go away, please!

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.880
- Stop it!
- Gotcha!

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.880
God, if I was
as pathetic as you are...

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.880
I would have killed myself
ages ago.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.880
You should get on with it.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.880
Where are my dad and Jenny?

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.880
You'll be seeing them soon enough.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.880
You're going to kill yourself
tonight, my dear.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.880
No, I'm not.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880
Surprise.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.880
Really?

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.880
Look in your eyes tells me...

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.880
you might not be so sure.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.880
After all, you have every reason
in the world to do it.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.880
I mean, you killed Chris...

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.880
and you killed your mom--

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.880
You killed your mom
when you were coming out of her.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880
Now, that is really special.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.880
Even I couldn't go that low.
Bravo!

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.880
Stop it, please!

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.880
What's the deal?
Why doesn't she use magic on us?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.880
Because she's weak!

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880
Weak, weak, weak.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880
Stop, please.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.880
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.880
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.880
- I didn't write that.
- It doesn't matter.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.880
Hand writing still looks the same.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.880
What's wrong
with your scars, Sarah?

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.880
It isn't real.

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.880
Then why are you still bleeding?

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.880
Run!

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.880
Run back up to your room
like the little coward that you are.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880
That's right.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.880
She's so pathetic!

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880
Stop it!

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.880
- Please, somebody help me!
- I'm bleeding!

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880
Please.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.880
What can I do?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.880
Rochelle, go upstairs.
See what's going on.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.880
No. This whole thing is just--

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.880
Get your lazy ass up those stairs
or I'll slit your throat!

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.880
- Dead as she is.
- Come on. I'll go with you.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880
Little shit.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.880
by the powers of mother and earth.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.880
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.880
By the powers of three times three,
make them see, make them see.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.880
Bonnie?

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.880
My hair. My hair!

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.880
It's coming back times three.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.880
Not again.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.880
What happened?

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880
Where are you going?

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.880
Hail to the guardians of the...

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.880
watchtowers--

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.880
Don't be afraid.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.880
Reach inside yourself.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880
Reach inside yourself.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.880
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.880
by the powers of mother and earth.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880
I invoke thee.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880
I invoke thee, Manon.

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.880
I invoke thee, Manon.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.880
Did I frighten you, Nancy?
I'm sorry.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.880
What's going on?
Why aren't you dead?

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880
Came to me.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880
Saved me.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.880
And he wanted me
to give you a message.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.880
You're in deep shit.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.880
He says you've abused what he's given
you and now you have to pay the price.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.880
Did he?

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.880
He did.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.880
By the way, what happened
to Rochelle and Bonnie?

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.880
They rushed out of here
without even saying good-bye.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.880
That's bad manners.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.880
What's going on?
What is going on?

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.880
Stop it! Stop it!

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.880
Relax. It's only magic.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880
Now who's pathetic?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880
Look.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.880
I know I'm a little crazy.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.880
I don't mean to be.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.880
It all got out of hand,
and I'm sorry.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.880
No more games, okay?

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.880
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.880
Good.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.880
- I'm gonna go.
- One thing first.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.880
I bind you, Nancy,
from doing harm...

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.880
harm against other people
and harm against yourself.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.880
Wait.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.880
Wait.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.880
I called him before you!

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.880
You bitch! You bitch!
I'll kill you!

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.880
I'll kill you!

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.880
Where are you?

01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.880
Where are you, Sarah?

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.880
Where are you?

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.880
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.880
I bind you, Nancy,
from doing harm.

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:16.880
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880
Good.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.880
Then again,
I can sleep at night, so--

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.880
How are you?

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.880
We want to apologize.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.880
- We feel really bad about--
- Trying to kill me?

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:34.880
Yeah.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.880
Honestly, we never thought
it would go that far.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.880
Hi, girls.
How're you doin'?

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880
Hi, Mr. Bailey.

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.880
And you know that thing on TV
about the plane crash...

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.880
was just a glamour.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.880
It was a practical joke.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.880
Funny.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.880
Sarah, wait.

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.880
We were just wondering,
do you still have any powers?

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.880
'Cause we don't.

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:05.880
Sorry.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.880
So if you ever want
to just hang out...

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.880
and chant or call the corners--

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.880
Maybe.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.880
Hold your breath until I call.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.880
She probably doesn't have
any powers anyway.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.880
Be careful.
You don't want to end up like Nancy.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.880
It's you. It's you.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.880
He gave me power.

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.880
I can do whatever I want now.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.880
I can fly.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.880
He gave you somethin', honey,
but it ain't the power.

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.880
But I can fly. I'm flying.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.880
I'm flying.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.880
I'm flying.
