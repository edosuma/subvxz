[Latin music playing over stereo]

00:30.905 --> 00:32.865
[music continues playing]

01:42.352 --> 01:44.562
-Good morning.
-[both] Morning.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.274
Ah.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.693
You're amazing.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.362
I know.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.284
Mami,  we already have crosses everywhere.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.536
Do we really need a pope on the fridge?

01:59.619 --> 02:02.497
Oh, yes, because he is so inspiring.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.333
You walk in to get a yogurt,
you see him...

02:05.417 --> 02:07.294
Hola, Papa.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.086
Puts a smile on your face.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.964
Well, why don't you put the pope
in your room and go smile in there?

02:12.048 --> 02:14.717
[laughs] I already have
two popes in my room.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.428
Gracias  very much.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.720
Oh.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.431
Oh, what's that,  Papa?

02:20.014 --> 02:20.849
Are you lonely?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.433
You wanna be with your friends?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.353
Well...

[continues speaking Spanish]

02:31.318 --> 02:32.985
[in English] He looks happy there.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.748
[theme song playing]

03:33.963 --> 03:35.840
You can probably dump
that whole thing on there.

03:35.923 --> 03:37.842
[laughs] Next time.

03:37.925 --> 03:39.051
-[chuckles]
-[door slams]

03:39.928 --> 03:42.472
[all] Hi!

03:42.555 --> 03:44.807
Welcome home, Lupita.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.603
We are almost done,
but there is plenty left.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.313
Aw.

03:50.397 --> 03:54.276
Dinner with my entire family...
And Schneider.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.655
Yes, I invited him again. He's an orphan.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.825
Do orphans always have rich dads
who buy them buildings?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.663
Hey, I may have money in the bank
and two living parents,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.205
and four living stepmothers...

04:09.874 --> 04:11.918
but there is a hole in here.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.464
We never had family meals.
I ate alone in front of the TV.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.800
Ay, pobrecito  Schneider.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.135
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It was a massive TV.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.808
Sometimes my nanny would join me,
but only if I agreed to watch telenovelas.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.393
Ooh, those are so over the top.

04:28.476 --> 04:31.354
Right? This one time,
Rosa got jealous of the housekeeper

04:31.438 --> 04:33.273
'cause she was makin' a move
on her man,

04:33.356 --> 04:36.484
so she threatened to throw
live scorpions on her while she slept.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.987
Sounds good. Which one was that?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.489
Oh, no. Rosa was my nanny.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.868
Ex-nanny. Now, stepmother.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.161
[sighs]

04:48.538 --> 04:50.164
I am so glad to be here.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.418
I'm just glad to be home with everybody.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.753
Who the hell are you?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.925
[scoffs] This is Carmen, my best friend.

05:01.008 --> 05:03.135
I'm doing my history project with her.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.139
These all sound like things I should know.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309
Hi, Carmen.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.269
Hi. [sighs]

05:15.815 --> 05:17.274
Ah.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.152
[grunts] I'm Penelope.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.613
Kind of a big deal around here.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.951
So, uh, what's this history project
you're working on?

05:27.034 --> 05:30.037
And then maybe later you can show me
how to turn into a bat.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.835
Well, we just got done
explaining the whole thing.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.504
Oh, come on,  mija,  I missed it.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.921
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.174
Alex, tell your mother that funny story
that happened in chemistry class.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.135
-Again?
-I know, okay, I'll tell it. [chuckles]

05:45.094 --> 05:50.016
So, there is the floor and... slip.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.018
[laughing]

05:52.101 --> 05:53.436
[Schneider laughs]

05:54.604 --> 05:55.980
Oh, that Dylan.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.400
Oh, that story never gets old.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.942
-[laughs]
-[Penelope] Oh, man.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.904
I've been workin' so much,
I'm missing all the scoops...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.197
plus Latina  Twilight  over here.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.120
Careful.
There's a lot of garlic in that chicken.

06:14.206 --> 06:17.209
Your mom's kind of mean.
I'm obsessed with her.

06:21.338 --> 06:24.801
Who would like a  pastelito?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.429
Mmm! You know what?

06:27.512 --> 06:30.181
How about we go on a family hike
this Saturday like we used to?

06:30.264 --> 06:33.225
Mom, uh, Carmen and I need all Saturday
for our history thing.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.145
Yeah, and  Abuelita  and I have tickets
to wrestling.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.564
I don't understand
why you waste good money on that.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.774
It's educational.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.943
Eh, I don't know.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.654
Okay, Saturday's out.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.281
How about we go on a hike
Sunday morning before it gets hot?

06:47.865 --> 06:50.785
You seem to have forgot.
Sunday morning is for church.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.455
So, we skip church.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.874
You seem to have forgot.
We don't skip church.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.169
Mami,  it's okay if we miss it one time.
It's not gonna kill us.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.212
Oh, really?

07:01.713 --> 07:05.174
My great uncle Luisito skipped church,

07:05.257 --> 07:08.928
and on the same day,
he was crushed by a runaway tractor.

07:11.388 --> 07:13.683
Why don't you just go to church
and then go hikin' after?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.018
We're Latinos, church takes all day.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.687
By the time you're done with mass

07:17.770 --> 07:19.606
and you've said hello to  fulano y fulana,

07:19.689 --> 07:22.734
-it's five o'clock!
-Oh, you exaggerate. 4:30.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.068
[Penelope clicks tongue]

07:25.152 --> 07:28.322
I wanna see these guys this weekend.
Come on.

07:28.405 --> 07:29.532
'Cause I like them. [chuckles]

07:29.616 --> 07:30.658
-[Alex and Elena chuckle]
-Oh, no,

07:30.742 --> 07:32.243
I have to put my foot down.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.203
Sundays we go to church...

07:34.287 --> 07:36.664
And then, sometimes we go to Applebee's.

07:37.164 --> 07:38.875
Well, I have a foot, too,

07:38.958 --> 07:43.295
and I'm gonna put my foot down and say
this Sunday we're not going to church.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.007
Well, I am putting both of my feet down.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.594
We are going
and that is the end of it.  Ya!

07:49.677 --> 07:51.053
That's not your decision to make.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.347
It's startin' to feel
kinda like home in here.

07:55.432 --> 07:57.560
I'm with Mom.
We don't need to go to church.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.730
After all,  Abuelita,
you don't even believe half that stuff.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.274
-I believe everything.
-[Elena] Really?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.775
When you take the communion

08:04.859 --> 08:07.820
you believe you're eating
the actual flesh and blood of Jesus?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.989
Ay,  no, it's a symbol.
Don't be gross.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.451
Okay, so, if you believe that,
then you're Protestant.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.370
There is no need for name-calling.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.417
All I know is that a good Catholic
does not skip church.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.544
Right,  papito?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.879
I like church.
I see my friends.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.589
I eat some donuts.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.342
Now, this one gets it.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.512
We're going.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.055
No, we are not!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.224
I work hard all week.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.101
When I get home, there's barely enough
time to have a meal with the kids.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.394
Weekends are my only chance.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.022
So, this Sunday, no church.
End of discussion.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.482
[speaking Spanish]

08:47.819 --> 08:49.278
-Ooh.
-[Carmen] Ooh.

08:49.361 --> 08:50.780
[in English] What? What'd she say?

08:52.364 --> 08:54.033
I am raising my voice,

08:54.116 --> 08:56.703
because I cannot believe
we're having this discussion!

08:56.786 --> 08:59.872
I'm their mother!
I don't need to ask permission!

08:59.956 --> 09:00.998
I decide.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.418
And I am your mother,
and I decide what you decide.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.756
We are a family, damn it!

09:10.633 --> 09:12.218
Don't make me choose between you.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.763
Okay, I'd choose Lydia because of
her warm food and even warmer hugs.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.389
But I'd feel really bad about it.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.310
All right, everybody, go do your homework.
Schneider, go call one of your moms.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.104
Fine.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.816
Guess I'll just go eat this all alone
in front of my massive TV.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.443
-Thought that was at your dad's house--
-I have one, too!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.279
-Ay.
-[door closes]

09:33.197 --> 09:34.616
Okay,  Mami...

09:35.199 --> 09:37.285
I love you, but I'm their mother

09:37.368 --> 09:39.621
and you're making decisions
that I should be making.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.955
-¿Ah, sí?
-Yeah.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.415
Like, I don't like the kids
having dessert every night.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.627
Oh, come on.  Es una cosita.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.212
But we have to watch our sugar.
Dad had diabetes.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.006
So, I killed your father?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.591
What? No!

09:53.926 --> 09:55.094
Mami,  look around.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.765
I told you, I don't want crosses
and pope stuff everywhere.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.601
My apartment looks like
Jesus' Pinterest page.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.896
This is my house,

10:04.979 --> 10:08.608
and I decide if I want obese kids
or the pope staring at me while I pee.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.903
Ah...  yo entiendo.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.447
I cook, I clean,
I teach the children manners...

10:15.531 --> 10:19.285
But if I should have an opinion,
you want me to keep my mouth shut.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.369
Ay,  exactly.

10:20.452 --> 10:21.621
-Thank you for understanding--
-No!

10:23.164 --> 10:24.999
So I am a servant?

10:25.082 --> 10:27.710
Like Cinderella? No,  Cinderbuela.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.673
No more!

10:31.756 --> 10:34.008
You don't like what I am doing,
I won't do it.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.135
-Mami,  please.
-I'll be in my servant's quarters.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.095
Slam!

10:41.015 --> 10:45.477
I have to say "slam"
because you would not give me a door!

10:48.690 --> 10:50.024
[alarm beeps]

10:50.107 --> 10:52.026
[Latin music playing over stereo]

11:14.841 --> 11:16.133
What?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.387
Eso...

11:20.471 --> 11:21.889
Yeah! Oh.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.440
Where's  Abuelita?

11:31.523 --> 11:33.442
-Pouting.
-Where's breakfast?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.902
Working on it.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.528
Where's breakfast?

11:36.612 --> 11:37.905
I'm... I'm working on it.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.281
Where are my pants?

11:39.865 --> 11:40.908
You're kidding, right?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.369
How can you not know
where your pants are at?

11:43.452 --> 11:46.122
Abuelita  washed them.
She said my cuffs looked shabby.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.706
Who am I to disagree?

11:47.790 --> 11:50.667
All right,  Mami,  you win!

11:50.752 --> 11:53.170
Where are Alex's pants?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.089
[Latin music continues playing]

11:59.510 --> 12:00.845
Where's  Abuelita?

12:01.595 --> 12:03.890
She's small.
She's probably under something.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.059
[music stops playing]

12:13.232 --> 12:14.441
Kids...

12:15.943 --> 12:18.070
I think your  abuelita
has run away from home.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.240
[knocking on door]

12:22.533 --> 12:23.826
[clears throat]

12:25.828 --> 12:28.705
-Hello, Schneider. Listen, have you--
-Wow!

12:28.790 --> 12:31.292
I always forget
how huge your apartment is.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.253
Nah, come on, it's not that big.
But let's talk in the parlor.

12:35.462 --> 12:37.423
Schneider, have you seen my mom?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.633
Gosh, no.

12:40.092 --> 12:44.305
[sniffs] Then why do I smell
fried plantains and Cuban coffee?

12:44.388 --> 12:46.140
Fine! She spent the night.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.475
But I want you to know, nothing happened.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.897
What were you thinking,
chasin' that woman away?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.982
She's funny, she's charming,
and when she gets angry,

12:55.065 --> 12:56.150
she cleans.

12:56.733 --> 12:58.402
-Where is she?
-[Schneider] I don't know.

12:58.485 --> 12:59.862
After last night's ugliness,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.281
she spent the night
and left without saying goodbye,

13:02.364 --> 13:04.158
so she already knows the drill.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.538
Unlike some people.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.836
What was that?
And why was she drinking my coffee?

13:16.337 --> 13:18.755
Well, when my family oasis
blew up last night,

13:18.839 --> 13:21.509
I had to seek solace in the arms of...

13:22.051 --> 13:23.219
I don't know her name.

13:24.803 --> 13:28.099
Your mom called her the "Stick Girl"
and made her eat  plato de huevos.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.979
Did  Abuelita  forget to give her
her pants, too?

13:35.606 --> 13:39.068
Well, there's no reason
to get lawyers involved.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.361
My daughter.

13:41.570 --> 13:45.699
Katie, if I raised my voice
the other night, I'm sorry.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.246
And I'm sorry for that, too. And that.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.831
No, no, wait, wait, no.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.543
Now I am not going to apologize
for saying "unemployed,"

13:56.627 --> 13:58.587
because that's what you are. [laughs]

13:59.796 --> 14:02.049
You're so sensitive. [imitates gunshot]

14:03.134 --> 14:06.595
And, sweetheart,
I just want you to be honest with yourself

14:06.678 --> 14:08.722
and ask what happens

14:08.805 --> 14:12.851
if your self-published vampire erotica
doesn't take off.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.814
No, no, of course, I believe in you.
[stutters] It's--

14:17.899 --> 14:19.650
And she's gone.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.110
[sighs]

14:21.944 --> 14:24.113
Well, you know how kids are.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.074
Thirty-seven is a rough age.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.827
Any word from your mom?

14:30.912 --> 14:32.872
No, but I'm sure she's home

14:32.955 --> 14:36.208
talking crap about me
with Juan Pablo and Benedicto.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.545
Has she ever disappeared like this before?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.464
No, usually when we fight,
she does the opposite of go away.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.675
She just sighs really loudly.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.553
[imitates Lydia]  "Ay!"

14:47.636 --> 14:50.847
[normal] Anything to draw attention
to the fact that she's wounded and nearby.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.393
[stutters] My ex used to have a sigh, too.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.811
It went like this...

14:55.895 --> 14:57.855
[inhales deeply] "I hate you!"

15:01.400 --> 15:02.944
I still miss her.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.280
I just... I don't...

15:06.363 --> 15:07.864
I don't have time for this drama,
you know?

15:07.949 --> 15:09.992
I got work, I got bills, I got kids.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.452
Well, doesn't she help out?

15:11.535 --> 15:14.788
Yeah, she gets the groceries,
cooks, cleans,

15:14.871 --> 15:17.208
spends time with the kids,
does the laundry--

15:17.291 --> 15:19.043
Sounds like she does everything.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.503
Well, it does when I say it out loud.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.132
She's also turning my apartment
into the Sistine Chapel.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.259
That must look amazing.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.138
-Okay, I'm not explaining this right.
-[cell phone rings]

15:31.931 --> 15:33.098
Wait, hold on.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.976
Oh, yeah.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.144
Hey, Schneider,
I am just about to leave. What's up?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.480
I just came down to get
my afternoon  café con leche

15:39.563 --> 15:40.940
and kiss on the cheek from your mom,

15:41.523 --> 15:43.484
-but she's still not here.
-What?

15:43.567 --> 15:46.112
But don't worry, though. I got this.
All three kids are fine.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.613
-Three?
-Yeah.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.656
Carmen, Elena's best friend?

15:49.740 --> 15:51.575
We have got to catch you up.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.205
I know who Carmen is.
She's the ghost who ate all my chicken.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.874
Hi, Ms. Alvarez.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.211
[Schneider]  Takin' you off speaker.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.714
Great. Now she's gonna send
her flying monkeys after me.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.012
-And now you're off speaker.
-Schneider!

16:11.720 --> 16:13.139
Oh, my God.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.975
Anyway... [sighs]

16:16.225 --> 16:17.768
I appreciate you helping me out.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.645
Ah, it's cool.
I had to get out of my apartment.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.813
Stick Girl is still up there.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.068
I called her an Uber this morning.
The guy never showed.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.653
Maybe it's a sign.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.238
Should I marry her?

16:30.572 --> 16:31.865
Schneider, I gotta go.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.077
Okay, now I'm worried.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.829
She's never not been home
when the kids get there.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.165
And plus, she's 70.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.957
One wrong move and she's down.

16:41.042 --> 16:44.128
You know, the entire world is
one giant, wet bathroom floor.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.549
-[stutters] Any idea where she could be?
-No, none.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.466
Huh...

16:50.050 --> 16:54.013
Where would a devout Catholic woman go

16:54.221 --> 16:58.100
after an argument with her daughter
about religion?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.937
[scoffs] Thank you, Dr. Berkowitz.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.772
Thank you.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.608
But we need to answer the question.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.660
[sighs]

17:22.916 --> 17:24.000
Hi,  Mami.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.006
So, you just assumed I was here?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.679
Because I'm an ignorant,
old woman married to prayer?

17:38.515 --> 17:41.352
But... you are here.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.233
Still... you shouldn't stereotype.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.528
-Hi, Birdie.
-[chuckles]

17:53.655 --> 17:56.158
She is such a suck-up.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.996
She thinks she's  tan  fancy
because her four grandsons are altar boys.

18:01.080 --> 18:01.914
Guataca.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.167
[scoffs] Move over.

18:06.710 --> 18:07.753
-Ah-ah!
-Oh!

18:13.092 --> 18:14.135
[sighs]

18:15.094 --> 18:16.220
So...

18:17.471 --> 18:19.265
have you been here all day?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.100
Getting decorating ideas?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.607
No...

18:29.608 --> 18:33.154
I have been riding around this morning
in something called  el  Uber.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.574
Oh, wow. That must've been expensive.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.910
Schneider set it up. I think it's free.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.495
[laughing]

18:41.578 --> 18:43.747
Oh, I think that car was for Stick Girl.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.166
Oh, her.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.879
Mami...

18:52.339 --> 18:56.092
I feel terrible about our argument,
but we gotta talk about some things.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.177
Okay.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.763
But you must keep your voice down,

18:59.846 --> 19:03.850
because you-know-who
just put in new batteries.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.570
So... I may have overreacted last night,

19:14.653 --> 19:18.490
but you have to understand,
I'm not gonna be a mom for much longer.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.951
Elena is having her  quinces.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.119
Alex is already using hair gel.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.539
And, you know,
soon they're gonna be out of the house.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.460
I just... I need you to give me
more space to parent.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.380
I understand what you are saying.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.758
-[crying] Don't put me in a home.
-What?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.180
What,  Mami?  No, no.
I wouldn't... I'm not gonna do...

19:41.263 --> 19:43.724
I would never do that.
I would never do that!

19:43.807 --> 19:45.392
-Ever.
-[mumbles]

19:45.476 --> 19:47.519
-Oh, no?
-No!

19:58.363 --> 20:00.490
I would never put you in a home.

20:01.157 --> 20:03.910
-Mami,  where is this coming from?
-[sighs]

20:03.994 --> 20:05.537
Your  abuela...  [sniffles]

20:05.621 --> 20:08.207
Berto's mama, used to live with us...

20:08.499 --> 20:12.211
And all day long,
she would slice onions...

20:13.169 --> 20:17.173
the most beautiful paper-thin onions.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.717
I remember.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.719
Nobody could slice an onion like  Abuela.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.096
Well, it's not that hard.
You need a sharp knife, that's all.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.310
But it made her feel useful.

20:29.228 --> 20:33.189
Problem was, we hated onions.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.317
So, one day we told her.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.112
The next week, dead.

20:39.195 --> 20:40.239
Oh...

20:41.197 --> 20:42.449
that's terrible.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.450
I know.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.912
I still get teary when I...

20:46.995 --> 20:49.331
[stutters] slice an onion.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.792
[sobbing]

20:55.295 --> 21:00.759
Mami,  you are the glue
that holds our home together.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.763
Without you, we'd be on the street
living in a cardboard box.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.890
[sighs] You're just saying that
to cheer me up.

21:06.973 --> 21:08.475
-No.
-[sniffles]

21:08.559 --> 21:11.019
I'm really not.
We need you.

21:13.229 --> 21:14.356
So,  Mami...

21:15.357 --> 21:19.445
could you make me  un cafecito
in the morning for the rest of my life?

21:19.528 --> 21:20.654
[sighs]

21:21.863 --> 21:24.199
[sniffles]  Claro.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.867
[Birdie] Aw...

21:33.792 --> 21:35.627
She is like a bat!

21:39.298 --> 21:40.132
Shall we?

21:41.007 --> 21:42.217
Yes.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.553
And we'll be back Sunday, anyways.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.931
Yeah, you know,
we'll talk about that later.

21:48.014 --> 21:49.891
We'll talk...
What's to talk about?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.603
Well... [stutters and chuckles]

21:52.686 --> 21:55.397
I'm just not sure I wanna go to church...

21:56.357 --> 21:57.441
[softly] Maybe ever again.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.444
What?

22:01.612 --> 22:04.155
She said she didn't want to go to church.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.160
-[dinging]
-Mami!

22:09.244 --> 22:10.704
Don't do that!

22:11.622 --> 22:13.332
Mami, por favor, vámonos ya,

22:13.415 --> 22:15.083
-please!
-You go on.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.336
I will pray for your eternal soul...

22:18.128 --> 22:20.130
And then call  el  Uber.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.762
[all] Hi!

22:28.388 --> 22:30.766
Welcome home, Lupita!

22:32.726 --> 22:34.019
We already started,

22:34.102 --> 22:36.813
but I insisted nobody say
anything interesting till you got here.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.815
Aw, that's so sweet.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.150
It's been weird.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.194
Did you find  Abuelita?

22:43.278 --> 22:44.821
Yeah, she's with Jesus now.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.907
-[Elena and Alex] What?
-[Penelope] No, no!

22:46.990 --> 22:49.951
Sorry. She's at church.
Uh, poor choice of words.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.162
[stuttering] Um, church.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.582
Uh, whoa! What do we have here?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.668
Oh, nothing special,
just some nutted quinoa,

22:57.751 --> 22:59.628
wilted broccolini
with radish micro-greens,

22:59.711 --> 23:01.296
and venison carpaccio on a bed of nettles.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.256
Grab a cedar plank and dig in.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.928
Big change from  Abuelita's  cooking, huh?

23:08.845 --> 23:09.971
You like it?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.770
I can't wait to have eaten it.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.526
I didn't think I would like nettles.
And I was right.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.404
Well, I'm competing with perfection here.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.739
It's okay, Schneider.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.867
We all thank you
for this very Caucasian meal.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.121
And good to see you again,
Elena's best friend, Carmen,

23:35.205 --> 23:36.457
you beautiful weirdo.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.544
I'm sorry things got crazy
the other night.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.878
That's... that's not us.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.338
Seems like us.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.633
We have all kinds of arguments
in my family.

23:46.717 --> 23:50.303
I have two brothers.
One's a priest, one's a witch, so...

23:58.186 --> 24:02.232
I am... really glad
I'm getting to know you better, Carmen.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.609
[door opens]

24:03.692 --> 24:05.276
Hello!

24:05.360 --> 24:07.445
-[Elena] Oh!
-[Schneider] Oh, thank God!

24:11.575 --> 24:13.660
I am so glad you're home.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.912
I was wilting under the pressure
to be you.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.499
Oh, hello, babies.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.085
I'm sure you did fine.
Who threw up on the table?

24:25.255 --> 24:26.590
What were you doing all day?

24:26.673 --> 24:29.885
Oh, you know, saying my Rosary,

24:29.968 --> 24:32.596
praying for the departed souls...

24:33.304 --> 24:35.974
Asking forgiveness for your mother.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.977
-Mami.
-Why?

24:39.060 --> 24:40.436
Oh, didn't she tell you?

24:40.521 --> 24:43.815
She's no longer going to church. Ever.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.400
We can do that?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.486
You can't.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.321
We will all go together. Us.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.533
Your mother will go hiking with Satan.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.621
Yeah, and then we'll go to Applebee's.

24:57.704 --> 25:01.249
'Cause Satan loves
the Fiesta Lime Chicken!

25:02.751 --> 25:06.838
So, I guess you want
to take my grandchildren to hell with you.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.090
I don't wanna go to hell.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.508
There is no hell.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.928
Don't worry,  papito,  there is.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.514
Okay! You... you really wanna do this?

25:16.598 --> 25:19.184
All right, let's do this.

25:19.267 --> 25:23.521
I am not even sure
I even believe in God, okay?

25:23.605 --> 25:24.773
[all gasp]

25:25.440 --> 25:26.608
Hardcore.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.488
Oye,  you're so smart.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.783
If God doesn't exist,
who made all of this?

25:34.866 --> 25:35.909
Target.

25:38.244 --> 25:41.331
Okay, can we agree
that if there is a God,

25:41.414 --> 25:44.042
it's gender-neutral,
not a he or a she?

25:44.125 --> 25:47.253
No! God is a man.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.965
If he were a woman,
there would be less problems.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.426
Pobrecito  God. He tries so hard.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.139
Look,  Mami,  I get it.
You like going to church. It's habit.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.810
You put on lipstick, you get dressed up,
you see your friends, you gossip...

26:01.893 --> 26:04.980
" Oye.
La nieta de Olguitita  got new  tetas."

26:06.940 --> 26:09.776
It's your little social club,  Mami,
and that's fine.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.237
It is more than that.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.573
I pray. I seek forgiveness.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.868
And I am so glad
that that gives you comfort.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.621
But that doesn't mean
that God exists, okay? I'm sorry.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.832
He kept you safe.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.420
Every day that you were gone,
he kept you safe.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.840
My little girl says
she wants to go in the Army,

26:32.382 --> 26:34.843
and then the Army sends her to Afghanistan

26:35.343 --> 26:38.889
where she is getting shot at
and I don't even know what else...

26:40.265 --> 26:41.975
Have you any idea...

26:42.934 --> 26:44.394
how much I worried?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.522
When you were deployed,

26:47.606 --> 26:50.609
I went to church every day

26:51.151 --> 26:53.904
and I prayed that he would keep you safe.

26:55.446 --> 26:57.282
[sniffles] And he did.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.702
So don't you tell me about God.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.580
I know that God exists.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.460
And he is great.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.926
[sobbing]

27:19.262 --> 27:20.931
Mami,  I'm sorry.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.642
- Perdón. Lo siento.
-[sniffles]

27:25.643 --> 27:26.978
I had no idea.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.940
You know, you went missing for one day

27:30.023 --> 27:31.524
and I was worried sick.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.237
I can't imagine what it must feel like
to worry all those years.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.783
Ay, sí.
All those years putting up with Birdie,

27:40.742 --> 27:44.162
with her terrible hairdos
and her smelly bad breath.

27:45.706 --> 27:46.998
[sobbing]

27:47.916 --> 27:50.043
-Look...
-[sniffles]

27:50.126 --> 27:51.627
I still wear the cross you gave me.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.005
[gasps] So you do believe.

27:54.089 --> 27:57.008
No, I don't wear it because it's a cross.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.260
I wear it because you gave it to me.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.597
I don't understand the difference,
so please just let me have this.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.349
-Okay.
-[both sobbing]

28:07.977 --> 28:09.771
So, are we going to church or not?

28:13.649 --> 28:16.361
Yes. Wait, no.
Wait... Sometimes, okay?

28:16.444 --> 28:17.904
-Sometimes, okay?
-Yeah.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.949
Well, at least...
at least Christmas and Easter. [sniffles]

28:21.032 --> 28:23.576
And one other time,
so we are not those people.

28:26.537 --> 28:28.915
And I'm not saying God doesn't exist.

28:28.998 --> 28:32.544
In fact, I check in with him
constantly, you know, like,

28:32.878 --> 28:35.713
"Please, God, don't let Elena
come home with a face tattoo." [exhales]

28:38.174 --> 28:41.552
And,  Mami,  I am glad
that you find comfort in church.

28:42.553 --> 28:44.222
I just find it in different places.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.808
You know, once in Afghanistan...

28:47.600 --> 28:51.354
I came out of 20 hours of surgery,
and I was so tired.

28:52.272 --> 28:56.234
I went into the break room
and Serena Williams was on TV.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.321
She was so focused.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.741
She was making these impossible shots.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.286
[stutters] And I just kept thinking about
everything that she had to go through

29:06.369 --> 29:07.954
to get to where she is.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.249
All the hours of sacrifice,
all the practice.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.294
And then I just felt like, "Okay...

29:15.837 --> 29:17.923
if she can do that, then I can do this."

29:20.550 --> 29:23.261
That's how I feel when I watch John Cena.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.932
Yes. Exactly.

29:27.015 --> 29:31.561
[stuttering] Exactly.
Or Sonia Sotomayor... or Death.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.609
Everyone has something that inspires them.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.780
Yo entiendo.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.660
[clicks tongue] I also... play Nintendo.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.458
[alarm beeps]

29:53.541 --> 29:55.668
[Latin music playing over stereo]

30:06.554 --> 30:07.931
[mouthing]

30:34.290 --> 30:36.167
-Good morning.
-[both] Morning.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.007
[music continues playing]
