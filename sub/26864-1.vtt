WEBVTT

01:01.255 --> 01:02.546
Son of a bitch.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.796
-How do you feel?
-Good.

01:10.421 --> 01:12.963
It's the dude I told you about.
He's family.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.171
Everything's there.

01:17.713 --> 01:18.588
You get one minute.

03:22.921 --> 03:24.713
Go home!

03:33.296 --> 03:35.296
Who was the chick at the field?

03:36.796 --> 03:38.755
No one. Just a friend.

03:40.213 --> 03:42.546
-Is she your girl?
-No way.

03:43.921 --> 03:46.421
Then why'd you bring her along?

03:51.171 --> 03:52.546
Do you talk to her?

03:53.755 --> 03:55.630
No, she doesn't know anything.

03:57.380 --> 03:58.588
Look at me.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.421
It's nothing serious.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.921
Look. This is for tomorrow.

04:13.088 --> 04:14.046
It's a V6.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.588
I'll do the plates tonight.

04:28.505 --> 04:29.963
By the way...

04:31.088 --> 04:33.255
We never really talked about it...

04:33.963 --> 04:37.463
but maybe the job I do is worth more?

04:41.796 --> 04:43.171
More what?

04:44.546 --> 04:46.005
More money.

04:46.171 --> 04:47.296
Like, uh...

04:48.130 --> 04:49.338
Like 10,000.

04:49.505 --> 04:50.755
It's a big job.

04:55.630 --> 04:57.588
What you do is worth 2,000.

04:58.213 --> 05:00.505
You get five 'cause we're brothers.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.880
I'll prove I'm worth more.

05:08.546 --> 05:09.505
I'm waiting.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.213
What's that?

06:01.671 --> 06:03.255
Lower the windows.

06:03.421 --> 06:04.296
All four.

06:23.296 --> 06:24.296
It's coming in.

07:17.963 --> 07:19.296
It's a hold-up!

07:27.796 --> 07:28.713
This is HQ...

07:29.255 --> 07:30.546
They're calling!

07:31.838 --> 07:32.921
Move out!

08:10.338 --> 08:11.213
Get out!

08:11.380 --> 08:12.796
Move! Faster!

08:12.963 --> 08:13.838
Get down!

08:14.005 --> 08:16.463
On your knees!

10:36.838 --> 10:39.505
At 9:00 a.m. this morning,
an armored van

10:39.671 --> 10:43.421
was ambushed by three vehicles
after leaving its depot.

10:43.588 --> 10:48.255
The robbers used explosives and
tear gas to neutralize the guards

10:48.421 --> 10:51.130
and made off with
several hundred blank passports.

10:51.296 --> 10:54.005
It's the first time
the Government Printing Office

10:54.171 --> 10:55.713
has been targeted in France.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.088
The robbery
was most likely masterminded

10:58.255 --> 11:00.130
by an illegal immigration network.

11:00.296 --> 11:03.630
The van contained
several hundred blank passports

11:03.796 --> 11:07.213
worth between 2,500 and 4,000 euros
on the black market,

11:07.380 --> 11:10.463
meaning a total
of over three million euros.

11:10.630 --> 11:13.088
One of the vehicles
used for the robbery

11:13.255 --> 11:15.130
was found burnt to ashes

11:15.296 --> 11:17.130
some 12 miles from the hold-up.

11:17.296 --> 11:20.505
The priority for investigators
is to find the robbers,

11:20.671 --> 11:22.296
who have disappeared.

11:22.588 --> 11:26.130
Searches are being carried out
throughout the Paris region.

11:32.755 --> 11:33.838
Wait...

11:34.005 --> 11:36.213
You haven't even taken off
your shoes.

11:38.171 --> 11:39.630
What's wrong with you?

11:41.421 --> 11:42.838
Did you take something?

11:46.546 --> 11:47.421
I did it.

11:47.588 --> 11:48.588
Did what?

11:49.088 --> 11:50.171
I did it.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.588
The van?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.588
Fuck.

11:55.171 --> 11:56.796
It's all over the news.

11:58.713 --> 12:00.546
I promise, everything's alright.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.755
Hang on, you could've told me.

12:02.921 --> 12:05.338
Trust me. Everything's fine.

12:05.755 --> 12:07.046
Everything's fine.

12:12.255 --> 12:13.463
How much?

12:15.838 --> 12:17.171
A lot!

14:04.671 --> 14:05.546
Here.

14:05.713 --> 14:06.838
Three hundred grand.

14:08.296 --> 14:09.255
Thanks.

14:12.546 --> 14:13.421
Not counting it?

14:13.588 --> 14:15.880
I'll be counting it all day long.

14:18.463 --> 14:20.713
Okay. I have to get going.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.921
Where?

14:22.088 --> 14:23.338
Back to work.

14:24.796 --> 14:27.338
You're going back
to your shit warehouse?

14:28.421 --> 14:29.588
Are you kidding me?

14:30.546 --> 14:32.421
You don't have jobs?

14:32.588 --> 14:34.921
I'm the dry cleaning king, dude.

14:35.088 --> 14:36.588
Six shops in Paris.

14:37.546 --> 14:38.796
How do you operate?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.963
You wait between gigs
or keep rolling?

14:44.755 --> 14:45.921
I keep rolling.

14:47.713 --> 14:50.255
They're gone. They had a car waiting.

14:51.463 --> 14:53.130
We celebrate tonight?

14:53.588 --> 14:54.630
Sure.

14:54.796 --> 14:56.713
Bring your wife and kid.

14:58.546 --> 15:00.546
So we work with a junkie now?

15:02.130 --> 15:03.005
What do you mean?

15:03.171 --> 15:04.380
He does oxy.

15:04.838 --> 15:05.838
Yes or no?

15:08.505 --> 15:10.255
I don't know you.

15:10.421 --> 15:11.671
You want my life story?

15:11.838 --> 15:12.963
I asked a question.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.630
I take one occasionally
to kill the pain.

15:24.796 --> 15:26.046
Can we move on?

15:26.213 --> 15:28.296
Cut the crap.
That was ten years ago.

15:28.463 --> 15:30.546
-You're a druggie.
-Chill, Franck!

15:34.338 --> 15:35.421
His work is clean.

15:48.963 --> 15:50.880
Daniel! Thanks, man!

15:54.213 --> 15:56.005
I like doing mornings.

16:17.088 --> 16:18.880
-That one's classy.
-No shit.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.713
-What do you think?
-I'd take all three.

16:23.296 --> 16:25.046
Here's 140 grand.

16:27.505 --> 16:29.755
Amine wants to pick up
the sedans with me.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.380
He digs German babes.

16:32.046 --> 16:33.713
I bet you dig them yourself.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.171
Don't say that.

16:35.338 --> 16:36.255
I've changed.

16:36.421 --> 16:37.421
Changed what?

16:37.588 --> 16:38.963
Changed, my ass!

17:11.630 --> 17:13.421
-Have a nice lunch.
-Thanks.

17:21.338 --> 17:23.296
-How much is there?
-Twenty grand.

17:29.421 --> 17:30.338
This is for you.

17:30.505 --> 17:31.755
No, it's okay.

17:32.130 --> 17:33.005
Come on!

17:33.171 --> 17:34.130
I mean it.

17:34.296 --> 17:36.255
I can't spoil my little sis?

17:36.421 --> 17:39.046
Let me pay back what I owe you first.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.755
She come here often?

17:45.505 --> 17:46.463
Yes, she does.

17:47.921 --> 17:49.005
Why shouldn't she?

17:49.171 --> 17:51.838
She doesn't ask questions
about the salon or me?

17:52.005 --> 17:52.880
No.

17:53.588 --> 17:55.005
She's not doing well.

17:55.546 --> 17:57.171
She has you and Amine.

17:57.338 --> 17:58.963
Come on, I'm starving.

18:01.088 --> 18:01.963
That's dirty.

18:18.671 --> 18:20.005
Who will be there?

18:21.130 --> 18:24.546
Nasser, Leslie and his partner.
I don't know who else.

18:26.463 --> 18:28.296
You liked Leslie, right?

18:28.463 --> 18:30.755
I saw her a few times during visits.

18:32.505 --> 18:34.046
Who invited me, you or them?

18:34.421 --> 18:35.296
They did.

18:35.713 --> 18:36.630
Right.

18:36.963 --> 18:41.130
That way they know your wife,
your kid and where you live.

18:41.296 --> 18:43.130
Stop being paranoid.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.546
I shared a cell with him.
He's a friend.

18:47.338 --> 18:49.171
This isn't about friendship.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.630
This dinner means
you're one of them.

18:51.796 --> 18:53.796
Nasser got busted with them, right?

18:53.963 --> 18:55.005
He wasn't busted.

18:55.421 --> 18:57.421
He was in pre-trial detention.

18:58.421 --> 19:00.505
Something to do with fingerprints.

19:01.630 --> 19:03.505
I won't visit you in prison again,
Eric.

19:08.546 --> 19:10.421
We have 300,000.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.046
Forget the dinner.

19:13.421 --> 19:14.963
We stop everything.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.421
What's the deal?

19:24.921 --> 19:26.505
You want to keep waitressing?

19:26.671 --> 19:29.505
Shit, Audrey.
You want me to carry crates forever?

19:30.088 --> 19:33.005
I have to work.
What'll happen if you go down?

19:33.463 --> 19:34.921
I won't.

19:43.296 --> 19:44.380
Come on.

19:56.005 --> 19:57.255
I won't go down.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.671
We'll go to Argentina,
like you wanted.

20:02.838 --> 20:04.213
You, me and Bastien.

20:05.546 --> 20:07.796
We'll lead the life we talked about.

20:29.630 --> 20:31.046
You coming?

20:31.213 --> 20:32.380
I'll catch up.

20:36.463 --> 20:38.005
I wanted to see you.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.505
Why?

20:43.588 --> 20:44.505
I need to.

20:48.921 --> 20:50.005
You think I need to?

20:51.880 --> 20:53.838
You think I forgot what happened?

20:55.005 --> 20:56.255
It was to protect you.

20:59.255 --> 21:02.588
You lied and hid your life
to protect me?

21:06.213 --> 21:07.921
I have no idea who you are.

21:10.838 --> 21:12.046
You're still doing it?

21:16.296 --> 21:19.046
I don't know why I ask,
you'll never stop.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.505
Let's get back together.

21:26.838 --> 21:27.755
I'll quit.

21:28.713 --> 21:30.671
Even you don't believe that.

21:32.671 --> 21:33.588
I mean it.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.671
No. You're lying to yourself.

21:43.796 --> 21:45.630
I know I made you suffer.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.421
But you know who I am.

21:52.046 --> 21:52.921
I have to go.

22:03.296 --> 22:04.463
Go to hell!

22:06.463 --> 22:08.963
The guy's this big, black hulk.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.838
-Good-looking too.
-Are you really saying this?

22:12.005 --> 22:14.505
-What do you say, Leslie?
-Good-looking.

22:14.921 --> 22:16.171
He's standing behind us

22:16.338 --> 22:17.963
while we're waiting in line.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.421
He's like checking us out...

23:02.171 --> 23:04.505
Everyone's French.
It's worse than Miami.

23:04.671 --> 23:08.213
That's Phuket and Pattaya.
Our place is on a quiet island.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.380
-Which island?
-Ko Phangan.

23:12.713 --> 23:14.338
No tourists, only hippies.

23:14.505 --> 23:15.838
Us two with hippies?

23:16.005 --> 23:18.296
It'd be cool for two or three weeks.

23:19.255 --> 23:20.505
So do I get tickets?

23:20.671 --> 23:21.755
No.

23:21.921 --> 23:23.838
-Why not?
-What about the salon?

23:24.005 --> 23:26.338
Come on.
What's the real problem? Yanis?

23:26.505 --> 23:29.255
You need
your big brother's permission?

23:32.463 --> 23:33.546
So...

23:33.880 --> 23:35.255
How did that happen?

23:37.505 --> 23:39.130
I'm just curious.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.880
Cops came
while I was laying the ammo.

23:47.213 --> 23:50.713
They opened fire. The charge
went off. I was two feet away.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.963
The rest of the crew ran...

23:53.921 --> 23:55.088
and I took the rap.

23:56.463 --> 23:57.588
How long?

23:58.130 --> 23:59.130
Seven years.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.713
Seven years?

24:01.380 --> 24:03.838
-How old is the kid?
-Six and a half.

24:04.005 --> 24:06.546
She was pregnant when I got busted.

24:08.546 --> 24:10.171
We're getting acquainted.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.088
You ever do time?

24:20.421 --> 24:21.921
No. Never.

24:22.630 --> 24:26.005
A few hours in custody as a kid.
Suspected robbery.

24:28.796 --> 24:29.838
Was it you?

24:30.255 --> 24:31.421
Of course it was.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.588
The problem was everyone knew.

24:33.963 --> 24:35.005
My mom found out.

24:35.171 --> 24:37.088
She kicked me out and moved.

24:39.046 --> 24:40.046
Listen...

24:40.213 --> 24:42.796
I don't give a shit
about money and whores.

24:43.171 --> 24:46.588
I like fucking over vans.
That's what gives me a hard-on.

24:47.255 --> 24:48.630
I'm in the field every day.

24:48.796 --> 24:50.713
I scout, think, take notes.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.963
For every job I do, I plan thirty.

24:54.380 --> 24:55.963
What do you do with the cash?

24:56.130 --> 24:59.880
I have businesses. I pump some in
to take care of my people.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.338
I won't do 30 vans.

25:09.463 --> 25:10.796
We'll talk again.

25:11.921 --> 25:12.838
Yanis!

25:13.421 --> 25:15.921
Eric!
Shit guys, come up here!

25:18.046 --> 25:20.255
I'll be right there. Coming?

25:23.671 --> 25:25.338
Let's do another one.

25:28.255 --> 25:29.963
Where's the dude? Arigato!

25:32.005 --> 25:33.213
Some more music!

25:34.838 --> 25:36.255
What's his name?

25:53.171 --> 25:54.755
Who's Amine's sister?

25:55.838 --> 25:56.921
Can I help you?

26:22.338 --> 26:24.505
-Did he touch you?
-No.

26:25.005 --> 26:26.505
-Was it a cop?
-No.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.463
Exactly what did he say?

26:40.630 --> 26:41.921
Out of my way.

26:44.630 --> 26:45.588
Get out of here.

26:50.546 --> 26:52.505
Don't worry, it's my big brother.

27:24.546 --> 27:28.005
A black guy came to the salon.
A big one. Who is it?

27:28.796 --> 27:29.671
I don't know.

27:29.838 --> 27:31.338
He wants you to call him.

27:34.796 --> 27:36.338
He didn't say why?

27:38.046 --> 27:39.380
What's this?

27:40.546 --> 27:42.880
-You been spending money?
-No.

27:46.630 --> 27:48.171
Tell me what you did.

27:49.630 --> 27:52.421
-I just wanted to make some cash.
-And?

27:54.421 --> 27:56.546
What did you do? Speak up.

27:56.713 --> 27:57.671
Nothing.

27:58.338 --> 28:00.588
Speak up, fuck! What did you do?

28:01.796 --> 28:03.338
I sold a gun.

28:04.255 --> 28:07.296
Just one. I got rid of the others,
like you said.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.588
I wiped the fingerprints. It's okay.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.921
We used it.

28:16.630 --> 28:20.171
The cops have the bullets.
They can trace the gun.

28:20.338 --> 28:21.588
Who'd you sell it to?

28:22.005 --> 28:24.213
-A guy from Sevran.
-What's his name?

28:24.463 --> 28:25.796
Greg. But he's not black!

28:25.963 --> 28:27.963
-Greg what?
-How should I know?

28:28.130 --> 28:30.255
How did they know about the salon?
You talked?

28:30.421 --> 28:32.838
He only knows I have a sister!

28:34.796 --> 28:36.255
Go on, call him.

28:38.921 --> 28:40.671
-You can't...
-Shut up and call.

28:46.046 --> 28:46.921
Voicemail.

28:47.546 --> 28:48.755
Try again.

28:54.255 --> 28:55.130
Voicemail.

29:19.505 --> 29:21.880
It's Amine. Who are you?

29:22.296 --> 29:23.713
No questions, bro.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.921
The pigs searched Greg's place.
They found your gun.

29:27.088 --> 29:29.088
He'll be charged with robbery.

29:29.546 --> 29:31.880
He'll get ten years because of you.

29:32.463 --> 29:33.588
What's this shit?

29:33.755 --> 29:34.921
What's this shit?

29:35.088 --> 29:36.838
Greg was our soldier.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.338
Stop playing badass.

29:39.505 --> 29:41.338
You've got two options.

29:41.505 --> 29:43.921
We strike a deal
or we waste your family.

29:44.088 --> 29:45.505
What do you say, cuz?

29:47.255 --> 29:48.130
I'm coming.

29:48.296 --> 29:49.963
I'll send the address.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.380
-Stupid idiot!
-Yanis, stop it!

30:06.421 --> 30:07.963
Don't rush into this.

30:08.338 --> 30:10.005
We'll find out about them.

30:10.963 --> 30:13.338
They want to talk,
they don't want war.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.630
They'd have taken Nora.

30:49.505 --> 30:50.880
Which one's Amine?

30:51.546 --> 30:53.588
-I am.
-You come alone.

31:38.338 --> 31:39.463
Put this on.

31:40.213 --> 31:42.255
You think you got a choice?

32:13.921 --> 32:15.130
Go to your room.

32:47.005 --> 32:48.796
You were wise to come.

32:50.796 --> 32:52.755
You lost a man because of me.

32:53.755 --> 32:55.338
I pay my debts.

32:56.546 --> 32:58.921
Let's settle on a price
and get this over.

32:59.088 --> 33:00.755
We don't want your money.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.713
We want the passport dudes.

33:03.921 --> 33:04.796
Why?

33:04.963 --> 33:07.671
Hey bro,
you're not the one asking questions.

33:08.213 --> 33:12.005
Did the guys downstairs do the job?
Should I bring them up?

33:13.046 --> 33:14.713
The passport job was me.

33:18.546 --> 33:21.255
We want your crew
to hold up a drug convoy.

33:21.796 --> 33:24.421
Eighty kilos of heroin.
In two days' time.

33:24.921 --> 33:27.338
Two cars. One lead, one carrier.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.671
Maybe a follower.

33:29.130 --> 33:31.963
They leave from Roubaix.
The drop-off is here.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.713
You do that and we're even.

33:36.171 --> 33:38.421
You have two hours to say you're in.

33:41.046 --> 33:42.380
I don't do this shit.

33:43.296 --> 33:45.838
We agree on a price and I pay.
I pay good.

33:46.713 --> 33:49.671
You think we're scum
'cause the stairwell stinks?

33:49.921 --> 33:51.296
You think we're shit?

33:52.671 --> 33:53.921
Come here, old man.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.588
Come here.

34:12.671 --> 34:14.046
This is Sevran.

34:14.421 --> 34:16.088
No one deals in our town.

34:16.630 --> 34:19.755
They won't listen.
They'll find out the hard way.

34:20.213 --> 34:21.296
Why don't you do it?

34:21.671 --> 34:23.046
And lose more men?

34:23.796 --> 34:25.338
You owe me one, pal.

34:26.380 --> 34:28.421
Your crew will do it for us.

34:29.296 --> 34:30.880
We saw you on TV.

34:31.213 --> 34:33.005
You're no pussies.

34:33.755 --> 34:34.963
We respect that.

34:35.755 --> 34:38.005
Tell me about your men.

34:38.171 --> 34:39.296
Forget it.

34:39.463 --> 34:41.296
-Forget what?
-Forget it.

34:41.671 --> 34:43.588
You want me to find out for myself?

34:44.421 --> 34:45.755
You'll find nothing.

34:46.130 --> 34:47.255
Listen, old man.

34:47.421 --> 34:48.921
You have two hours.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.380
Or we give your name to the pigs.

34:52.296 --> 34:53.255
You talk to pigs?

34:53.671 --> 34:54.880
I talk to everyone.

34:55.338 --> 34:57.880
If I make money, I don't give a fuck.

35:03.296 --> 35:04.505
This one's tough!

35:05.088 --> 35:06.546
Okay, listen to me...

35:08.713 --> 35:10.255
I'll count to three...

35:10.963 --> 35:13.005
What're you whispering about?

35:13.963 --> 35:15.838
Go on, now!

35:16.005 --> 35:18.338
Not right before the hard part!

35:19.130 --> 35:20.213
Let me win!

35:20.380 --> 35:22.338
-We won!
-Stop it!

35:29.171 --> 35:31.380
We strike 12 miles after they leave.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.213
Two men aren't enough.
I need you.

35:34.380 --> 35:36.421
They'll never get off our backs.

35:36.588 --> 35:40.505
It'll never be enough.
And when they're done with us?

35:40.796 --> 35:42.421
They'll shoot us in the back.

35:42.588 --> 35:46.421
That's why we'll hold up the cargo
and sell it ourselves.

35:46.838 --> 35:48.505
Eighty kilos of heroin. Three million.

35:49.546 --> 35:50.671
What about the guys?

35:53.088 --> 35:55.880
Are you serious? We're killers now?

35:58.546 --> 36:00.338
And you say nothing?

36:00.505 --> 36:03.755
You said it yourself,
they'll never get off our backs.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.463
Slow down here. I'm a thief.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.546
We do hold-ups, not killings.

36:08.713 --> 36:11.463
If a guard plays hero,
I take him down straight.

36:11.630 --> 36:14.296
But you're asking me
to premeditate murders?

36:14.463 --> 36:16.796
To sell heroin? Are you sick?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.005
Shit, you're serious.

36:19.171 --> 36:21.338
Listen, we need to lie low...

36:21.505 --> 36:22.463
Don't be a wimp.

36:22.630 --> 36:24.588
Don't talk to me like that.

36:24.963 --> 36:26.796
It's your brother who fucked up.

36:26.963 --> 36:28.088
You settle it.

36:28.255 --> 36:30.380
Piece of shit. I fed you for years.

36:30.546 --> 36:33.713
You fed me? I'm a piece of shit?
You think I'm your boy?

36:35.380 --> 36:38.546
This is my place.
Go fuck yourself, Yanis.

36:40.338 --> 36:41.755
Find another crew.

36:51.213 --> 36:52.963
We went by your place.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.755
I got you your things.

36:58.963 --> 37:00.421
Go easy on him.

37:00.588 --> 37:03.088
Are you serious?
He's thick in the head.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.505
He's a fuck-up.

37:04.671 --> 37:06.421
Stop it. You sound like Dad.

37:06.588 --> 37:09.255
Don't mention that fucker's name.
I protect you.

37:10.255 --> 37:12.255
-What do they want?
-Stay out of it.

37:12.421 --> 37:13.671
I'll handle things.

37:15.213 --> 37:17.213
But you can forget about Franck.

37:17.671 --> 37:19.921
He didn't help me.
He's a piece of shit.

37:23.588 --> 37:25.088
Don't do this to me.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.130
Nora, you're free to leave with him.

37:29.921 --> 37:31.380
But you forget about me.

38:16.546 --> 38:17.588
Mom.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.213
Mom, open the door.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.463
I know you're there.

38:34.838 --> 38:35.921
Open the door.

38:52.755 --> 38:54.088
Let me come in.

39:22.713 --> 39:24.046
What do you want?

39:24.671 --> 39:27.463
I want you to come to my place
for a few days.

39:29.463 --> 39:31.005
There's trouble.

39:31.588 --> 39:33.046
Where are Nora and Amine?

39:33.421 --> 39:34.546
At my place.

39:34.713 --> 39:35.963
What's going on?

39:38.130 --> 39:40.463
You dragged us
into your dirty games again?

39:40.963 --> 39:41.838
Please.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.963
Get your things.
You have to come with me.

39:46.338 --> 39:47.463
Listen carefully.

39:47.713 --> 39:51.213
You leave right now
or I call the police and turn you in!

39:51.380 --> 39:55.005
And if anything happens
to Nora or Amine, I'll do the same.

39:56.546 --> 39:57.630
Get out.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.130
Get out!

40:09.296 --> 40:11.838
-Don't let her out of your sight.
-Okay.

40:28.380 --> 40:30.671
We need three or four soldiers.

40:31.546 --> 40:33.005
I'll find them for you.

40:48.213 --> 40:51.213
JosÃ©, it's Eric.
You mind if I take my break now?

41:03.046 --> 41:06.088
-Audrey, where are you going?
-Give me five minutes.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.380
We're talking about 900,000.

41:09.796 --> 41:12.546
Do you understand
what I'm saying, baby?

41:12.838 --> 41:15.546
Look at me.
I'll stop after that, okay?

41:16.421 --> 41:18.130
Nine hundred grand of heroin, Eric.

41:19.671 --> 41:21.171
What's the problem?

41:21.338 --> 41:24.921
A hold-up is cool
but you don't touch drug money?

41:25.088 --> 41:27.755
I don't give a shit.
That's not the point.

41:27.921 --> 41:30.796
-These guys are thugs, not guards.
-It'll be fine.

41:30.963 --> 41:33.755
-Audrey, get a move on!
-I'm coming.

41:41.130 --> 41:42.880
You remember what you said?

41:43.171 --> 41:45.880
If you got nailed,
I should split with the cash.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.630
I'd never do that in my life. Never.

41:50.421 --> 41:52.671
But if you care about us,
don't do this.

42:09.130 --> 42:10.005
Where are you?

42:10.171 --> 42:11.088
Yanis' place.

42:11.255 --> 42:13.963
What's the address? I'll pick you up.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.755
You refused to help him?

42:21.755 --> 42:24.380
Trust me.
Don't let him mess with your head.

42:24.546 --> 42:26.630
You don't know what he's planning.

42:31.005 --> 42:32.421
I can't do it.

42:38.421 --> 42:40.255
Franck, forget about me.

42:40.755 --> 42:42.171
Just forget me.

47:35.213 --> 47:36.671
We've got the car.

47:37.838 --> 47:39.755
No, no, no. Not Sevran.

47:40.171 --> 47:41.963
I'm calling the shots now.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.046
We're heading to Sevran.

48:13.380 --> 48:16.255
The place will be guarded.
Stay at a distance.

48:16.588 --> 48:17.796
What happened?

48:20.380 --> 48:21.296
I see you.

48:23.838 --> 48:25.380
Where's Nasser?

48:26.296 --> 48:29.255
Stay focused. Keep your distance,
don't get spotted.

48:33.713 --> 48:34.838
Let's go.

49:08.838 --> 49:09.963
Where's my mother?

49:10.130 --> 49:12.963
Not far.
She goes free once I have the smack.

49:14.088 --> 49:16.046
Hands on the truck, both of you.

49:18.213 --> 49:19.380
Do it!

49:21.505 --> 49:22.838
What's your problem?

49:28.755 --> 49:30.255
Where are your guns?

49:31.296 --> 49:32.755
Behind the seats.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.296
What do they have?

49:47.546 --> 49:49.838
You'll get them back
with your old lady.

49:52.838 --> 49:53.880
Hey you!

49:55.296 --> 49:56.421
Bring the car down.

49:58.380 --> 49:59.880
Move your ass.

50:49.421 --> 50:50.296
Go on.

50:54.505 --> 50:56.296
Hey, be careful!

50:56.880 --> 50:57.921
Don't rip the bags.

51:02.505 --> 51:04.463
Your mom's guard was a good man.

51:04.630 --> 51:06.963
He told us everything before he died.

51:08.546 --> 51:11.213
He even told us the name
of your powder man.

51:12.171 --> 51:13.380
We found your digs.

51:14.713 --> 51:17.755
Our guys are slamming your wife
while your kid watches.

51:17.921 --> 51:19.588
Shut your face!

51:20.380 --> 51:21.463
Calm down.

51:22.296 --> 51:23.463
Don't play hero.

51:25.213 --> 51:27.296
Behave and nothing will happen
to anyone.

51:29.546 --> 51:31.046
Turn your head around.

51:41.921 --> 51:43.421
Dirty bastards.

51:44.463 --> 51:45.963
You thought you'd play us?

51:46.130 --> 51:47.463
Who's in the BMW?

51:48.213 --> 51:49.713
Tell them to split.

51:59.421 --> 52:00.671
They're leaving.

52:02.630 --> 52:03.546
Okay.

52:33.171 --> 52:35.921
Look at the truck! Look at it I said!

53:19.588 --> 53:20.546
Get up!

53:20.838 --> 53:22.171
Shut up!

53:22.755 --> 53:24.380
-This way!
-Where?

53:24.546 --> 53:26.380
Out back! This way!

53:36.046 --> 53:37.796
Yanis, I'm going with them!

53:38.671 --> 53:39.921
What's going on?

53:41.755 --> 53:43.088
Get in! Get in!

53:44.630 --> 53:46.505
Hurry up! Go, go, go!

53:48.380 --> 53:50.421
-Where's my mother?
-Rougemont.

53:52.588 --> 53:56.255
I've got your name. Take me
or I smoke your wife and family.

53:56.421 --> 53:58.046
Snuff the old lady!

53:58.588 --> 53:59.880
Shut your face!

54:00.546 --> 54:01.588
Snuff her, I said!

54:10.421 --> 54:11.671
Turn left ahead.

54:11.838 --> 54:13.005
Faster, Amine!

54:15.171 --> 54:16.338
Left!

54:24.463 --> 54:25.421
Move!

54:29.921 --> 54:31.796
Wait for us on the other side.

54:32.796 --> 54:34.171
-This way?
-Yes.

54:37.005 --> 54:38.296
Clear out!

54:39.421 --> 54:40.588
This way?

55:00.880 --> 55:02.505
Is this it? Huh?

55:13.671 --> 55:14.546
Come on!

56:38.255 --> 56:39.130
Amine!

56:39.296 --> 56:40.380
Come on!

56:46.088 --> 56:48.130
Get out of the car! Get out!

56:48.755 --> 56:49.630
Move it!

56:49.796 --> 56:51.046
Get in the car!

56:53.713 --> 56:54.713
Get in!

57:12.880 --> 57:14.713
Get out. Get out.

58:03.796 --> 58:05.213
You could apologize.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.630
Sorry.

58:06.796 --> 58:08.005
Come on.

59:06.296 --> 59:07.921
We have to leave for Morocco.

59:08.296 --> 59:10.088
To Tarek's cousin's place.

59:10.338 --> 59:11.213
For how long?

59:13.463 --> 59:14.630
A while.

59:15.088 --> 59:16.213
I won't leave without Amine.

59:16.588 --> 59:20.505
I'll handle everything.
I'll get the best lawyer in Paris.

59:20.671 --> 59:24.046
You didn't understand.
I don't want him going to jail.

59:25.463 --> 59:26.880
I never asked you for anything.

59:27.838 --> 59:29.880
I want you to bring Amine back.

59:31.213 --> 59:32.755
Bring my son back.

59:56.088 --> 59:57.380
Good evening.

1:00:02.713 --> 1:00:04.171
They transfer your brother tomorrow.

1:00:04.338 --> 1:00:05.296
What time?

1:00:05.463 --> 1:00:06.588
Before 10 a.m.

1:00:07.130 --> 1:00:09.296
He's not going straight to court.

1:00:09.588 --> 1:00:11.671
They're taking him to police HQ.

1:00:11.838 --> 1:00:14.088
The crime division will take over.

1:00:14.255 --> 1:00:16.005
They linked him to the drug hold-up.

1:00:16.421 --> 1:00:17.880
How long is he looking at?

1:00:18.755 --> 1:00:19.630
Ten years.

1:00:20.255 --> 1:00:21.505
Minimum.

1:00:23.796 --> 1:00:25.255
You told him not to talk?

1:00:25.421 --> 1:00:27.171
Yes, he knows that.

1:00:27.338 --> 1:00:28.213
He's tough.

1:00:29.838 --> 1:00:32.296
Exactly where do you want
your liquid assets sent?

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:33.338
Morocco.

1:00:34.588 --> 1:00:35.463
How soon?

1:00:36.171 --> 1:00:37.713
As soon as possible.

1:00:39.213 --> 1:00:41.921
We can set up accounts for you
over there.

1:00:42.755 --> 1:00:45.880
But the urgent nature
of your request will be costly.

1:00:46.588 --> 1:00:47.463
How much?

1:00:47.921 --> 1:00:50.005
I have to double-check...

1:00:50.255 --> 1:00:51.671
but I'd say 30 to 40%.

1:00:51.838 --> 1:00:53.546
Fine. Where do I sign?

1:00:55.671 --> 1:00:56.880
Sign here.

1:00:57.380 --> 1:01:00.588
I need to know the exact time
of my brother's transfer.

1:01:00.921 --> 1:01:02.005
Do what it takes.

1:01:30.421 --> 1:01:31.880
I want Mommy.

1:01:33.671 --> 1:01:35.213
Daddy, I want Mommy!

1:01:36.921 --> 1:01:38.213
I want Mommy!

1:01:38.380 --> 1:01:40.130
Shut up for Christ's sake!

1:01:49.963 --> 1:01:50.921
I'm sorry.

1:01:55.296 --> 1:01:56.838
I'm sorry, son.

1:01:59.713 --> 1:02:01.296
Mommy went away.

1:02:01.921 --> 1:02:04.171
Everything will be alright. Okay?

1:02:05.296 --> 1:02:06.171
Come on.

1:02:06.338 --> 1:02:07.505
Look at me.

1:02:11.630 --> 1:02:13.630
I promise, everything will be fine.

1:02:14.171 --> 1:02:15.130
Okay?

1:02:33.130 --> 1:02:34.171
I'm sorry.

1:02:57.630 --> 1:02:58.963
You lied to me.

1:03:00.255 --> 1:03:02.130
You all lied to me.

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.546
Why did you do it?

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:06.921
I'm not like you, Mom.

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:10.046
I didn't want your life.

1:03:12.505 --> 1:03:15.255
I was stupid, but I wanted more.
That's all.

1:03:49.338 --> 1:03:50.796
What are you doing here?

1:03:53.630 --> 1:03:55.255
People have died.

1:03:57.505 --> 1:03:58.963
People close to me.

1:04:01.088 --> 1:04:02.921
I'm partially responsible.

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.505
Are you wanted?

1:04:15.255 --> 1:04:18.296
I don't want any more lies.
Are you wanted?

1:04:24.755 --> 1:04:26.296
I'm going abroad.

1:04:27.421 --> 1:04:28.921
I want you to come with me.

1:04:29.505 --> 1:04:32.046
I know you have your music
and your life.

1:04:32.338 --> 1:04:34.338
I'm not asking you to stop.

1:04:34.796 --> 1:04:36.796
We'll settle wherever you want.

1:04:36.963 --> 1:04:38.630
You'll be the one to decide.

1:04:39.088 --> 1:04:40.463
Come with me.

1:04:45.005 --> 1:04:46.463
No, Yanis.

1:04:47.171 --> 1:04:48.838
It's out of the question.

1:04:52.546 --> 1:04:54.380
-Come with me.
-Stop it.

1:05:06.963 --> 1:05:10.171
A shoot-out broke out today
in the Sevran housing project.

1:05:10.338 --> 1:05:12.296
The police have taken suspects

1:05:12.463 --> 1:05:15.880
into custody and will continue
carrying out searches...

1:05:22.546 --> 1:05:23.630
Come with me.

1:05:23.796 --> 1:05:25.213
Go on, son.

1:05:34.380 --> 1:05:36.088
-What's your name?
-Bastien.

1:05:54.463 --> 1:05:55.546
I'm sorry.

1:05:58.713 --> 1:06:00.921
They'll be looking for me and my boy.

1:06:01.963 --> 1:06:04.421
There's no one to take care of him?

1:06:06.255 --> 1:06:07.296
No.

1:06:11.005 --> 1:06:13.005
We'll go down for sure.

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:21.130
I'm sending my mother
and sister to Morocco. Go with them.

1:06:23.463 --> 1:06:25.421
My man will take you to Marseilles.

1:06:25.588 --> 1:06:28.088
I know someone who sails to Tangiers.

1:06:28.255 --> 1:06:29.838
You'll hide in Casablanca.

1:06:40.296 --> 1:06:41.255
What about you?

1:06:42.296 --> 1:06:45.338
My brother's in custody.
I want to get him out.

1:06:47.713 --> 1:06:49.005
With who?

1:06:49.171 --> 1:06:50.255
Daddy?

1:06:51.296 --> 1:06:52.838
Hey, little man.

1:06:53.755 --> 1:06:55.130
How's it going?

1:06:55.296 --> 1:06:57.338
Everything's alright. Come here.

1:06:59.963 --> 1:07:02.755
-Come on.
-Go with the lady.

1:07:13.755 --> 1:07:14.755
I'll help you.

1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:21.505
Stay with your kid. He needs you.

1:07:22.588 --> 1:07:24.380
I'm not asking for much.

1:07:25.171 --> 1:07:27.671
You make sure he's okay
and I'll help you.

1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.213
It's a win-win.

1:07:42.505 --> 1:07:44.255
You're not coming with me?

1:07:45.463 --> 1:07:47.338
I'm leaving you with Nora.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:49.713
She's sweet, you'll see.

1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:52.171
I'll be with you soon, okay?

1:07:53.213 --> 1:07:54.255
Look at me.

1:07:54.796 --> 1:07:56.546
I promise I'll be there soon.

1:08:00.338 --> 1:08:01.630
If you have any doubt,

1:08:02.046 --> 1:08:03.380
stop and call me.

1:08:04.171 --> 1:08:05.255
Get going.

1:08:56.588 --> 1:08:58.546
Amine, can you hear me?

1:09:03.046 --> 1:09:04.213
Don't move!

1:09:04.713 --> 1:09:06.296
I said don't move!

1:09:11.755 --> 1:09:13.005
Shit!

1:09:14.255 --> 1:09:15.713
Get out of here!

1:09:21.130 --> 1:09:22.588
Go on!

1:12:26.630 --> 1:12:27.963
Get down!

1:12:37.838 --> 1:12:38.963
Run. I'll cover you.

1:12:39.130 --> 1:12:40.380
Run, I said! Now!

1:13:19.255 --> 1:13:20.713
Look straight ahead.

1:13:38.630 --> 1:13:39.755
The bus.

1:14:00.463 --> 1:14:01.963
Relax, it'll be fine.

1:14:19.963 --> 1:14:20.838
Stay here!

1:14:23.755 --> 1:14:24.630
Keep your cool.

1:14:24.796 --> 1:14:27.755
We're going to go through with it.
Please, Amine.

1:16:17.213 --> 1:16:19.338
We'll be there soon.

1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:46.380
