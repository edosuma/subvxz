00:03.637 --> 00:05.039
Okay, Tyler, here comes
Catheter Zeta Jones

00:05.106 --> 00:07.741
to help you go
Sarah Jessica Pee-Pee.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.044
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.380
Looks like you gave him
a Woody Harrelson.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.049
Do you have any idea
how much talent

00:15.116 --> 00:17.685
it takes to run
a surgical team?

00:17.751 --> 00:20.121
I have an M.D.
from Harvard.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.156
I'm board certified
in cardiothoracic medicine

00:22.223 --> 00:24.292
and trauma surgery.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.660
I have commendations from seven
different medical boards

00:26.727 --> 00:30.131
in New England and Brazil
and I am never ever sick at sea.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.566
So, I ask you, when someone
goes into that chapel

00:32.633 --> 00:35.636
and they get down on their knees
and they pray to God

00:35.703 --> 00:37.471
that little Becky
doesn't die in surgery

00:37.538 --> 00:40.341
who do you think
they're praying to?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.776
You ask me if I
have a God complex?

00:42.843 --> 00:44.812
Well, let me
tell you something.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.447
I am God.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.883
I just think your daughter
could participate more in class.

[Childrens Hospital theme music]

00:54.388 --> 00:56.324
Where are you taking us?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.425
- Blood pressure?
- Completely stable.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.093
- Vitals?
- Strong.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.361
This is not an emergency.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.995
- We need more time.
- Damn it!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.464
We're just here
for our appointment.

01:03.531 --> 01:07.034
- It was at 10:30.
- Get them outta here.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.704

Daughter.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.341
Aren't they just words?
Speaking of families.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.376
How come on TV, family
arguments are resolved

01:15.443 --> 01:16.810
by the end of the episode?

01:16.877 --> 01:19.247
I don't know about you,
but in my house

01:19.313 --> 01:21.815
folks be hating on each other
for years.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.851
No, but I do watch a lot of TV

01:23.917 --> 01:25.586
and I especially love
the commercials.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.456
Like, what's the deal
with the beer ads?

01:28.522 --> 01:31.692
Who are the wizards that
came up with these things?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.595
Anyway, today at Childrens,
all the mothers

01:34.662 --> 01:38.532
and fathers are bringing
their daughters to work.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.101
Your daughter is
very cute, Lola.

01:41.169 --> 01:44.405
Thank you. Okay, Willow,
time for your juice.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.542
- Oh!
- Oh!

There you go. What?
Is there a problem?

I support
a woman's right to choose.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.416
Alright, who have we here?

01:55.483 --> 01:58.386
Hey, Chief. I want you to
meet my little Schmoitle.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.621
- Hello, Schmoitle.
- Good Shabbos.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.657
Here's your name tag,
right here.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.461
- Okay, she's not taking it.
- Yeah, she can't pick that up.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.098
That's considered work and
she can't work until sundown.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.933
You know, Shabbos.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.407
Well, I have brought...my little
baby daughter, Harmony here

02:19.473 --> 02:22.676
to see what Mommy
does for her living.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.479
Yeah, I actually own my
own real estate business so--

02:25.546 --> 02:28.148
She's a little shy
so I brought her special friend

02:28.216 --> 02:29.883
Montana to see her.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.853
Mama. I threw that away
when I was, like, nine--

02:32.920 --> 02:34.455
Hello, Harmony. Did you miss me?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.324
Did you take that
out of garbage?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.226
- I wanna kiss Harmony.
- I want to.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.460
- Please.
- I want to kiss.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.094
- I want to..
- Oh, my gosh.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.198

day with all our babies.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.452
Where were the harmonies, huh?
Where's the passion?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.554
I'm sorry, daddy.
It'll be better next time.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.323
I hate the sound
of your voice.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.751
Parents don't know
what to choose.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.220
The meat and potatoes
or the stinky fish salad.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.855
Sport, let me
ask you a question.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.492
When dad takes you
to the ballpark, do you like

03:44.558 --> 03:47.127
a foot-long frank or a hot
steaming plate of vagina?

03:47.194 --> 03:48.629
Mr. and Mrs. Leplante,
why now?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.331
Ray's always wanted a son.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.132
- Scalpel.
- I've always wanted a girl.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.501
What mother wouldn't?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.836
We thought we'd know
what to do by now.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.672
Perhaps you've noticed a change
in his...her vocal pitch

03:58.739 --> 04:01.409
or her...his pissing technique.

04:01.475 --> 04:06.113
Has she...he been exhibiting
any stereotypically

04:06.179 --> 04:07.615
female behaviors?

04:07.681 --> 04:10.351
Like interrupting the
man when he's talking?

04:10.418 --> 04:12.386
This is the biggest
decision of its life.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.421
(Valarie)
'Exactly.'

the whole kitchen.

I can't. I can't do--

what Mommy does for a living?

Yeah, I am. It is actually
worse than last year.

- What? What?
- Take that out of your mouth.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.636
- What is this?
- Lollipop.

05:02.703 --> 05:07.741

- It's a lollipop.

You wanna grow up
to be something stupid

like a hair stylist
or do you wanna be

05:54.722 --> 05:56.189

or a lumberman?

05:56.256 --> 05:57.791
You get
to have a penis.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.462
You can whip it out at parties,
hit people in the face with it.

Throw it on your wrist
like a cool watch.

06:03.797 --> 06:07.000

pick up loose change with it.

You can't do any of
that stuff with a vagina.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.539
You can't give birth
with a dick.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.041

give birth if Herm tried

- Period.

Oh, she perioded.

- You're on your period.
- Ew. Disgusting.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.609
- That is gross.
- Stop it.

06:48.676 --> 06:53.146
I've listened to everything
you have to say...and I realized

06:53.213 --> 06:59.152
it doesn't matter if you're
a male or a female...or both.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.254
All that matters..

07:01.321 --> 07:02.690
...is what's in your heart.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.794
Are you crying?

No.

you won't touch

Oh-oh-oh.
Where you're going

07:25.112 --> 07:27.548
you're gonna get
your lollipop licked plenty.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.018
By a bunch of dudes.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.187
I'm sorry.
I don't follow you at all.

07:34.254 --> 07:37.090
- In prison.
- Mom, this is my boyfriend.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.127
Oh, is that what he calls it?
Oh, you disgust me!

07:40.193 --> 07:41.995
God, yes.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.698
That's what we're calling it,
'cause I'm 27 years old.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.334
He's not a child molester,
because I'm not a child.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.002
Where did he touch you?
Show me.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.838
- My God!
- Show me on Montana.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.206
- Did he touch you here?
- Couple of times.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.908
- There?
- Just the tip.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.377
- He touch you there?
- Mom, everywhere. We had sex.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.113
- Oh, God.
- I drive an unmarked white van.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.083
'Cause I'm an undercover
lollipop salesman.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.518
Look, here's my card.

Discretion guaranteed. "

- Mom.
- Yeah.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.131
You're too old for "Take Your
Daughter to Work day".

08:18.198 --> 08:19.600
It's time to let me go.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.102
It's just really hard
to accept that..

08:22.169 --> 08:24.304
...your little girl
doesn't need you anymore.

08:24.371 --> 08:28.375
That's crazy. I need you.
I need you, Mom.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.544
'I love you.'

08:30.611 --> 08:32.145
Ah!

08:33.681 --> 08:35.448
Can I borrow her for a minute?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.250
- Yes.
- Come on.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.686
Grab onto my cripple sticks.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.321
Let's go for a ride
just like we used to.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.990
For old time's sake.
Here we go.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.526
- Whoa. Go faster!
- Up, up and away.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.261
Bye, bye, you guys.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.230
Have fun, but be safe.

We don't want two cripples
in the family.

certainly blame the Jews *
