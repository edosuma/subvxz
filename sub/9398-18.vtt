<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.140
You saved me.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.642
You saved me, too.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.507
<i>I borrowed some money from these guys,</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:15.548
so they asked me
to shave a few points in the last game.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.211
- Everyone get away from the door.
- Oh, Jimmy, what did you do?

00:19.753 --> 00:20.947
Go.

00:21.554 --> 00:22.885
<i>What are you doing here, Lucas?</i>

00:24.157 --> 00:26.125
<i>I don't think Jimmy killed Keith.</i>

00:26.192 --> 00:30.094
Keith's dead, okay? He's not coming back.
Open your eyes.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.927
<i>Open your eyes, Luke. Open your eyes.</i>

00:33.500 --> 00:35.832
Hey, Skills? You know this girl?

00:35.902 --> 00:38.837
Yeah. That's Abby.
She was in the tutor center.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.532
Jimmy let her go.

00:46.746 --> 00:50.011
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>
<i>if anything is absolute anymore.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.417
<i>Is there still right and wrong?</i>

00:54.187 --> 00:55.677
<i>Good and bad?</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:57.848
<i>Truth and lies?</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:00.819
<i>Or is everything negotiable?</i>

01:01.161 --> 01:04.129
<i>Left to interpretation? Gray?</i>

01:04.197 --> 01:07.826
- Who is it?
- My name's Lucas Scott.

01:09.169 --> 01:12.104
I was wondering if I may talk to Abby.

01:12.839 --> 01:15.501
There's no Abby here.
You have the wrong address.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.941
Well, no, no, no, I was just...

01:20.447 --> 01:22.540
Thanks for nothing.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.421
<i>Sometimes we're forced to bend the truth,</i>

01:29.222 --> 01:31.122
<i>transform it,</i>

01:31.191 --> 01:35.093
<i>because we're faced with things</i>
<i>that are not of our own making.</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:44.426
<i>And sometimes</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:50.875
<i>things simply catch up to us.</i>

01:57.417 --> 01:59.851
Coach Durham, can you address
the allegations of point shaving

01:59.919 --> 02:02.615
and illegal activity within the Ravens?

02:04.691 --> 02:08.491
Look, I'm gonna say this one time
and one time only.

02:09.162 --> 02:13.599
This is the best group of boys I've had
in 35 years of coaching.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.601
These are not cheaters.
They're champions.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.365
Every one of them.

02:26.513 --> 02:30.313
There's only three things
I'm afraid of losing in this world, Haley.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.780
You, our son and the game.

02:36.489 --> 02:40.152
How bad will it get
if they find out about you and Daunte?

02:40.693 --> 02:43.287
They'll take my scholarship for sure.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.766
And I probably won't play anywhere, ever.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074

03:28.041 --> 03:29.372
Hey!

03:30.109 --> 03:32.475
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

03:35.448 --> 03:38.747
Hey, Brooke,
I heard about that stalker thing.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.480
I tried calling you, but I never heard back.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.716
Yeah, it's...

03:46.359 --> 03:48.691
Where's your Clean Teen T-shirt?

03:49.762 --> 03:51.821
Things change, you know?

03:53.099 --> 03:55.158
Yeah, I know.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.239
I'll see you later.

04:02.308 --> 04:06.369
- Hey. Do I have any blood on me?
- No, why?

04:06.446 --> 04:09.472
Because I just saw Chase
and it feels like I got my heart ripped out.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.540
I think you'll be okay.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.745
- Do I look insane?
- No, why?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.789
I saw him again. This time in the shower.

04:16.856 --> 04:20.485
Peyton, you gotta stop
doing this to yourself, okay?

04:20.560 --> 04:23.427
Fake Psycho Derek,
whatever the hell his name is,

04:23.496 --> 04:25.191
he's locked up. You know that.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.496
Yeah, that's what they said last time,
or what he said.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.796
I don't know, maybe if I just see it

04:29.869 --> 04:33.202
with my own eyes
that he's actually behind bars, I...

04:33.273 --> 04:34.467
Maybe.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.005
Come on.

04:41.547 --> 04:42.809
Hey.

04:42.882 --> 04:46.613
You know what? I'm gonna
have to catch up with you, okay?

04:46.686 --> 04:47.983
Okay.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.148
Hi, baby.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.718
I knew you'd come.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.029
Well, they said that you wouldn't,

05:33.866 --> 05:35.766
but I knew that you would.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.034
I wanna know why.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.133
Why me? Why did you pick me?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.475
You love me.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.579
No, I don't.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.814
I hate you.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.911
Don't you get that?

05:52.985 --> 05:59.584
You are just a deranged, pathetic psycho
and I never, ever wanna see you again.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.257
Okay?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.534
Then why'd you come?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.734
Have I been in your head?

06:15.341 --> 06:18.367
You asked me
to come into your life, Peyton.

06:19.645 --> 06:20.737
You got undressed

06:20.813 --> 06:22.212
- in front of your webcam...
- What?

06:22.281 --> 06:25.546
...because you knew
it would make me want you.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.812
You posted those pictures online.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.823
- You are wrong.
- Am I?

06:33.993 --> 06:36.962
Is that why you're dressed like that today?

06:38.498 --> 06:40.466
Are you a tease, Peyton?

06:41.167 --> 06:42.794
Dressing sexy?

06:44.103 --> 06:49.507
Wearing that perfume, making me ache
for you and then saying no?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.701
Stop.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.005
Are you a tease, Peyton?

06:53.079 --> 06:56.378
Because that would
really be disappointing.

06:57.817 --> 07:02.550
- I did not do this. You did this.
- No! You did this!

07:02.822 --> 07:05.313
- You did this to me, Peyton!
- Open the gate, please.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.325
It's all your fault!

07:07.393 --> 07:10.954
You did this to me! You did this!

07:12.064 --> 07:13.531
Tease!

07:26.546 --> 07:30.277
I thought you'd look a lot worse,
considering the walls are closing in.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.250
- What do you mean?
- The point shaving, Dad.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.850
Right.

07:37.690 --> 07:41.456
- What are you hearing?
- Nothing. You think it's Bear?

07:41.527 --> 07:44.985
No. No. If it was Bear,
he'd have pointed them right to us.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.964
Sounds like the whispers
of someone who lost a lot of money

07:47.033 --> 07:49.263
but isn't close enough to know the details.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.133
Well, they're asking questions
about Lucas now, and it's not right.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.196
He only missed those free throws
because of me.

07:54.273 --> 07:58.676
Okay, but that's the only time
I ever wanna hear you say that out loud.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.938
Look, first you won
the State Championship

08:02.014 --> 08:03.879
and every postseason game
that Lucas played in.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.077
So they're grasping at straws.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.485
- You don't think it's serious?
- No, it's serious.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.692
Because if they find proof,
your future's in jeopardy.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.291
But I don't think
they're gonna find any proof.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.991
So what do I do?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.999
You stay cool, deny everything

08:25.371 --> 08:27.896
and pray no one uncovers the truth.

09:17.189 --> 09:18.781
I'm sorry. Sorry.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.385
I didn't mean to scare you.
I didn't mean to scare you.

09:22.461 --> 09:26.397
My name's Lucas Scott.
We go to school together at Tree Hill.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.496
Do you know me?

09:32.038 --> 09:33.938
My uncle was Keith Scott.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.236
And I know that you were
in the tutor center that day,

09:36.309 --> 09:39.073
and I know that Jimmy let you go.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.840
So...

09:42.248 --> 09:43.545
Listen.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.984
I have to know what you saw, Abby.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.815
Okay? You gotta tell me.

09:52.592 --> 09:57.689
Did Jimmy Edwards kill Keith?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.464
What is this?

10:10.176 --> 10:13.077
- What the hell is this?
- Look, Mrs. Brown, I can explain.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.943
Get out. Get the hell out of my house
or I'll call the police.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.108
And tell them what?

10:18.184 --> 10:21.881
That your daughter knows the truth
about my uncle's death?

10:22.655 --> 10:24.748
Your uncle was Keith Scott?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.460
I'm very sorry for you,

10:31.530 --> 10:35.591
but my daughter has been traumatized
since then.

10:35.668 --> 10:39.399
She hasn't been to school.
Her life has become very difficult.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.270
And that is why I lied to you last night.

10:44.276 --> 10:48.975
Listen, Abby told me that Jimmy Edwards
didn't kill my Uncle Keith.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.042
Did she?

10:59.525 --> 11:02.050
Honey, is your name Abby?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.230
Am I your mother?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.533
Are you sure?

11:20.713 --> 11:23.978
Now, I'm very sorry for your loss.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.677
That day changed all of us,
and none of us for the better.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.151
But I'd like you to leave.

11:32.992 --> 11:37.224
And, Lucas, don't come back.
Abby has been through enough.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.647
Hey.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.820
Hey.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.757
- Jeez, you look worse than I do.
- Yeah.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.961
Listen, the thing is that Nathan said

12:12.031 --> 12:14.158
this whole gambling thing's
just gonna go away,

12:14.233 --> 12:16.701
and I don't really know
how much I believe that.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.862
And I just wanted to know
what you thought,

12:18.938 --> 12:22.999
if you think that he's right or...
Do you think he's right?

12:24.076 --> 12:27.341
No. It's not going away.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.574
'Cause he said that, you know,
they're just focusing on you

12:29.648 --> 12:32.412
and then they're not gonna find anything
and nothing's gonna happen.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.783
Yeah, but, see, that's the problem.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.721
You know, yeah, I mean,
I missed a couple free throws.

12:37.790 --> 12:41.886
But I'm a sub.
I played half a season, 15 minutes a night.

12:41.961 --> 12:46.455
No gambler's gonna build
a point shaving scheme around a reserve.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.000
Okay, so what is gonna happen, then?

12:49.068 --> 12:52.265
Well, I think that,
after they're done looking at me,

12:52.338 --> 12:55.501
that they're gonna start
taking a look at Nathan.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.972
And I hate to say it, Hales,
but when they do,

12:59.211 --> 13:01.679
it's gonna end up really bad.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.543
Okay. Okay.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.616
How bad is really bad?

13:15.294 --> 13:18.024
Well, Nathan's not gonna go to jail.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.128
But he's not gonna go to Duke, either.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.233
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

13:39.051 --> 13:40.575
Tease.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.190
Peyton?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.321
Hey, what's wrong?

13:53.399 --> 13:56.095
- I went to see him.
- Who?

13:57.203 --> 13:59.034
Oh, no. Derek?

13:59.972 --> 14:02.941
Lan. His name is lan.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.803
- I know.
- You do?

14:16.121 --> 14:18.715
I've been hiding these from you.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.352
There's been a lot of articles
about the attack.

14:21.427 --> 14:25.887
- I thought you were clipping coupons.
- I know, honey, but I hate coupons.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.087
Come on.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.901
- Did you leave the front door unlocked?
- No.

14:38.177 --> 14:42.614
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a key.
I didn't know if you were sleeping. Sorry.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.239
It's okay.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.715
You locked the door, right?

14:45.784 --> 14:47.809
- Yes, I did.
- Okay.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.855
I used to love my room.

14:50.556 --> 14:55.016
And he took it from me.
Psycho Derek. It's like...

14:55.594 --> 14:57.755
I really thought if we just fought back,

14:57.830 --> 15:00.298
like, if we attacked our attacker,
that he would go away.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.231
But he hasn't.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.563
It's really gonna take some time, Peyton.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.802
You guys went through
something really traumatic.

15:09.875 --> 15:13.311
Yeah, but what if you have finals
and you can't sleep

15:13.379 --> 15:15.176
and you don't have time?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.274
Well, then hopefully you have a friend

15:18.350 --> 15:21.581
who's gonna tell you
that life kicks you around sometimes.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.919
It scares you and it beats you up,

15:24.990 --> 15:30.587
but there's a day when you realize
that you're not just a survivor,

15:31.230 --> 15:32.857
you're a warrior.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.668
You're tougher than anything
it throws your way.

15:38.337 --> 15:41.033
And you are, Peyton.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.805
You are.

15:47.479 --> 15:50.039
And so are you, Hales.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.209
Thank you. And so are you, Brooke.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.588
Well, thanks.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.320
Come here.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.804
I was hoping for a booty call.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.409
Sorry, Coach.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.936
What's so important
it can't wait till a decent hour?

16:23.782 --> 16:26.216
It's the investigation.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.081
It was me.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.819
I missed those free throws
in the semifinals on purpose,

16:34.893 --> 16:40.058
and I just wanted you to hear it from me
before I held a press conference tomorrow.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.395
I'm sorry, Coach.

16:44.403 --> 16:48.396
You know, I only took a chance on you
because Keith asked me to.

16:49.074 --> 16:53.204
- I know, and...
- He would be ashamed of you right now.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.272
Just like I am.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.452
- Keeping in shape?
- Yes, sir.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.391
Now, Duke's gonna be pretty rough,
especially if you're not in shape.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.754
Yes, sir.

18:20.199 --> 18:26.900
So, there's some reporters
asking questions about gambling.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.901
Point shaving, that kind of thing.

18:30.976 --> 18:34.139
- You know anything about that?
- No, sir.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.608
Well, your brother's name's
not gonna be worth a damn

18:38.684 --> 18:40.879
when this whole thing comes down.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.616
What do you mean?
Lucas didn't do anything wrong.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.557
- Not what he says.
- What?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.030
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:54.833 --> 18:55.925
You're welcome.

18:56.001 --> 18:59.027
Screw that, Luke.
We said we weren't gonna say anything.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.696
- We agreed.
- So what?

19:00.772 --> 19:02.763
So what did you do?

19:02.841 --> 19:06.675
I went and saved your stupid ass
so you can play college basketball

19:06.745 --> 19:08.542
and have everything
you've ever dreamed about.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.377
Well, you know what?
That's a bunch of crap.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.110
We could have beat this thing, man.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.015
It sounds like
you're feeling a little guilty to me.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.781
Yeah, of course I'm feeling guilty.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.685
But you shouldn't have said anything
to Whitey, man.

19:17.756 --> 19:21.248
- That was a stupid thing to do.
- You know what? I don't care.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.521
I'm not going to college
to play basketball anyway.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.722
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter

19:25.797 --> 19:28.630
that, for the rest of time,
people are gonna talk?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.668
They're gonna say
you disgraced the game, Luke.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.135
That doesn't matter to you?

19:32.204 --> 19:34.900
Let them say
what they wanna say about me.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.807
It's what they say about Jimmy Edwards
that matters to me

19:38.877 --> 19:41.209
and what they say about Keith.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.681
But this?
At least I know the truth about this.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.813
Peyton thinks I'm a martyr.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.788
I can't stop this, Luke. I just...

19:54.860 --> 19:59.263
I'm this close, man.
And I got the baby. I can't.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.966
You shouldn't have said anything.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.467
- What's going on?
- It's a new day.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.068
Move your scrawny butt.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.444
I checked the shower and Psycho lan's
not in there, so you need to be

20:17.516 --> 20:19.177
because, no offense, you're kind of rank.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.947
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, I just call them like I smell them.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.544
Chopitty, chopitty.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.682
- What are you doing?
- I told you. We're warriors.

20:26.758 --> 20:30.524
We kicked that idiot's psychotic ass,
so a new day dawns, P. Sawyer.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.997
Yeah, but when I went to go see him...

20:35.400 --> 20:37.664
Brooke, he said I led him on,

20:37.736 --> 20:41.866
that I led him on with, like,
my podcasts and my webcam

20:41.940 --> 20:43.737
and the way that I dress.

20:43.809 --> 20:47.370
Peyton. So you're saying that every girl
who wears a little bit of lipstick

20:47.446 --> 20:50.040
and a short skirt
is asking to be assaulted and raped?

20:50.115 --> 20:55.212
No, of course not.
But I did give him full access to my life

20:55.287 --> 20:58.279
and now he knows all this stuff about me
and he uses it, you know?

20:58.357 --> 21:01.224
- He uses it to get in.
- Okay.

21:01.293 --> 21:05.252
Then it's time we start learning
a little bit about him.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.355
Get up and fight, warrior.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.335
And take a shower.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.235
- Just the ammo today, sir?
- Yeah, just the ammo.

21:17.309 --> 21:21.075
The only reason I ask
is we just got this baby in today.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.738
.45 automatic.

21:22.814 --> 21:27.046
And if you've got your handgun permit,
you can be shooting her today.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.007
How'd that feel?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.341
Jeez. Who knew
there were so many lan Banks?

21:56.415 --> 21:58.508
Well, maybe we should add "stalker"
to the search.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.811
Really.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.878
So where's your head at
with Chase these days?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.917
I don't know. I think about him a lot.

22:08.727 --> 22:13.061
You know how it is. I start wondering
if he ever thinks about me,

22:13.131 --> 22:16.225
and if he does, is it the same?

22:17.369 --> 22:21.738
Did he leave 'cause of the videotape,
or was he just looking for an out?

22:21.807 --> 22:24.674
You know, same old self-doubt.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.770
Oh, wow, this is him.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.374
- He's not from St. Flora. He's from Texas.
- What?

22:32.451 --> 22:36.148
Oh, my God.
His girlfriend looks just like you, if you...

22:36.655 --> 22:38.020
If I what?

22:40.926 --> 22:42.894
If you were dead.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.957
- I wanna tell someone, Mom.
- Abby.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.662
I'm tired of lying about what I saw

23:25.737 --> 23:29.798
and I'm tired of hiding out
and pretending I'm crazy.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.174
- I wanna go back to school, Mom.
- Honey, you can't.

23:33.378 --> 23:36.142
As soon as I make enough money,
we'll go someplace different. We will.

23:36.214 --> 23:39.650
- But for now, we have to do it this way.
- Why?

23:39.718 --> 23:42.050
Because I say so, that's why.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.054
So, what, then?
We just hide from our lives?

23:44.122 --> 23:48.115
- At least we have lives.
- Not really, Mom.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.787
And you might be afraid of this,
but I'm not.

23:50.862 --> 23:54.093
Abby. Abby. Abby!

24:02.641 --> 24:04.700
- You need to get out of here.
- I wanna talk to you.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.334
- I said get out!
- Just stop it! Calm down!

24:06.411 --> 24:09.869
Just shut up! Will you shut up? Just...

24:10.182 --> 24:13.379
Okay, look, I need you to sit down.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.580
Just go sit down.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.686
Sit down.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.457
You're Abby Brown.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.861
Look, I don't know
what you think you might've seen.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.426
- She didn't see anything.
- Shut up!

24:32.504 --> 24:34.028
Just...

24:34.906 --> 24:37.704
- You made a mistake.
- No.

24:37.776 --> 24:41.439
I saw you. I saw everything.

24:41.513 --> 24:45.074
- Abby! She's not well.
- I know what you did.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.380
And so do you.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.160
My brother, Keith,
was always better than me.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.166
He had a better heart.
People liked him more.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.031
No, they loved him.

25:05.203 --> 25:07.034
Karen loved him.

25:08.306 --> 25:09.500
But

25:14.946 --> 25:16.573
Karen was mine.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.911
She was supposed to be mine.

25:26.424 --> 25:29.484
She was just a girl
who went to school that day.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.994
She's just a girl.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.758
I hope you burn in hell.

25:39.237 --> 25:41.102
So do I.

26:27.185 --> 26:30.120
Well, if it isn't Tease One and Tease Two.

26:32.524 --> 26:36.119
- Did you come back for another kiss?
- Not really, Derek.

26:36.962 --> 26:39.123
Or should I call you lan?

26:39.197 --> 26:40.994
Yeah, we know your real name.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.557
Actually, we know a lot of things
about you.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.603
We spoke to all your teachers
at the Alton Academy

26:45.670 --> 26:46.967
and the girls you used to date.

26:47.038 --> 26:50.701
- You don't know anything about me.
- Really?

26:50.775 --> 26:52.606
Susanna Gold ring a bell?

26:52.677 --> 26:55.145
You know, a lot of teenage boys
have performance anxiety.

26:55.213 --> 26:58.444
I know a lot of teenage girls
who are teases, too.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.512
Is that really the best that you've got?

27:02.587 --> 27:04.521
'Cause we have a lot more
than some podcasts

27:04.589 --> 27:08.116
and a few webcam photos, lan Banks.

27:08.927 --> 27:12.693
- Whatever.
- Boyfriend of Maggie Watterson.

27:13.398 --> 27:17.767
- Or should I say former boyfriend?
- You shut your mouth, you whore.

27:17.836 --> 27:21.135
Hey. What happened to Maggie, lan?

27:23.775 --> 27:26.903
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

27:26.978 --> 27:31.915
Because the accident...
You were driving. It was prom night.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.008
No, it wasn't my fault!

27:37.188 --> 27:39.554
What happened, lan?

27:40.592 --> 27:42.150
Lan?

27:43.061 --> 27:46.087
We were just messing around,

27:47.365 --> 27:49.299
driving fast.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.633
My father never let me drive that car.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.601
He loved that car.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.669
The road was slippery. You lost control.

28:01.746 --> 28:06.649
I tried to wake her up,
but there was just blood.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.918
There was just so much blood.

28:13.191 --> 28:16.422
Her parents said it was my fault. They...

28:17.362 --> 28:19.353
They all said it.

28:21.633 --> 28:24.500
I can't be Maggie, lan.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.366
I'm not Maggie.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.407
We were gonna be together forever.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.478
She loved me. She...

28:35.847 --> 28:37.508
She trusted me.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.519
She forgives you.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.286
She forgives you.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.399
I forgive you, too.

28:55.467 --> 29:00.928
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:03.174 --> 29:06.166
I'm not gonna be seeing you anymore.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.577
And you're not gonna see us, either. Ever.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.641
Ever.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.913
Goodbye, lan. I hope you find peace.

29:32.737 --> 29:35.501
We talked about not saying anything.

29:35.573 --> 29:38.838
Lucas... He was supposed to do nothing.

29:39.644 --> 29:43.580
- He's really just trying to help out.
- It's just so Lucas, you know?

29:43.648 --> 29:45.582
Trying to be the hero.

29:45.917 --> 29:50.081
I'm not gonna feel guilty about it.
Nobody asked him to do this.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.282
That's not exactly true.

30:01.499 --> 30:05.162
He's doing this for me
because I asked him to.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.433
And if you're not gonna feel guilty about it,
then I sure as hell will,

30:08.506 --> 30:10.940
because he is my best friend
and he's your brother

30:11.009 --> 30:14.035
and he's doing this for all of us,

30:14.646 --> 30:16.944
for you and me and our son.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.115
And it just really sucks.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.149
Damn it.

30:24.122 --> 30:28.650
I'm sorry, Hales.
I'm sorry I put us through this.

30:28.726 --> 30:32.526
I'm sorry I made you ask Lucas
to take the blame.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.627
I'm sorry I've been so weak about all this.

30:34.699 --> 30:39.500
Nathan, you are about to make
every dream you've had come true.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.004
Everybody understands that.

30:41.072 --> 30:44.269
No, it's not worth it.
I mean, what the hell was I thinking?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.469
- You were...
- We're gonna be parents soon.

30:46.544 --> 30:50.344
What would we want our son to do?
What would make us proud?

30:50.415 --> 30:53.578
And what am I gonna say to him someday
when he asks about this?

30:53.651 --> 30:55.642
That it was Dan?

30:55.720 --> 30:57.915
That I put what I wanted
in front of everything else?

30:57.989 --> 31:01.584
Nathan, you're gonna lose it all.

31:01.659 --> 31:04.287
Your scholarship, the game that you love.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.330
I won't lose it all.

31:07.198 --> 31:11.498
I'll still have you,
and we'll still have our son.

31:11.569 --> 31:14.970
And we'll have that feeling that,
in the face of all this,

31:15.039 --> 31:17.064
we didn't lose our way

31:17.141 --> 31:19.666
and we still know right from wrong.

31:21.512 --> 31:24.845
I'm just scared for you.

31:25.350 --> 31:30.686
I love you for this,
but it's not my dream that's dying.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.120
It's yours.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.159
I know it's gonna be hard. I know that.

31:35.226 --> 31:38.491
But the people I admire

31:38.563 --> 31:42.556
are the people that carve a life
for themselves after their dream dies.

31:44.435 --> 31:47.233
My father could never get past it, Hales.

31:47.872 --> 31:51.706
He could never let go
of what he wanted when he was 17.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.138
Look what it did to him.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.560
Open your eyes, Lucas.

32:45.396 --> 32:46.988
Open your eyes.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.435
- Abby?
- I need to talk to you.

32:59.210 --> 33:02.338
I know what my mom said
and I'm sorry she lied,

33:03.715 --> 33:06.206
but I need to tell you some things.

33:06.284 --> 33:08.912
You were hiding in the hallway.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.848
I got scared and I ran.

33:12.857 --> 33:16.122
But I was worried about the others
and Jimmy, too.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.226
<i>I saw it in his eyes when he let me go.</i>
<i>He was just scared, too.</i>

33:23.301 --> 33:25.201
You came back.

33:25.269 --> 33:28.466
What happened after that?
Abby, come on, you gotta tell me.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.029
Please.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.633
Your Uncle Keith, he tried to help Jimmy.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.611
- Please.
<i>- But he couldn't.</i>

33:39.450 --> 33:42.942
- Jimmy...
- Jimmy what? Jimmy what?

33:44.889 --> 33:45.981
No!

33:46.591 --> 33:50.960
Was my Uncle Keith still alive
when Jimmy shot himself?

33:57.602 --> 33:59.570
Who shot him, Abby?

34:01.339 --> 34:03.273
I thought once he realized
someone knew the truth,

34:03.341 --> 34:05.172
he'd come forward.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.404
So I stalked him
with messages and threats.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.936
I thought he'd turn himself in.
I thought I'd be safe.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.505
But he found me.

34:12.583 --> 34:17.918
Who? Who killed Keith?
Who killed my uncle?

34:26.496 --> 34:28.431
Your father.

34:31.536 --> 34:37.132
It was your father, Dan Scott.
He killed Keith.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.703
He was there, and he picked up the gun.

34:44.514 --> 34:48.417
And you know I'm right, don't you?
You know it in your heart.

34:51.155 --> 34:53.918
You have to come forward.
No, you gotta tell somebody, Abby.

34:53.991 --> 34:56.755
Abby, you have to tell somebody!

34:56.828 --> 34:58.557
I did.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.964
I told you.

35:01.632 --> 35:03.156
I'm sorry.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.784
Coach.

35:27.658 --> 35:31.025
I don't how you can look your brother
in the eye, Nathan.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.327
This is a damn disgrace.

35:34.398 --> 35:37.765
Coach, I lied to you
on the River Court yesterday

35:37.835 --> 35:39.803
and during the playoffs.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.768
- It wasn't Lucas.
- I know.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.040
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.206
More than you'll ever know.

36:27.418 --> 36:30.581
<i>When I was two years old,</i>
<i>I made my first basket.</i>

36:31.622 --> 36:36.059
<i>When I was six, basketball went</i>
<i>from being a game to a sport.</i>

36:36.761 --> 36:41.323
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>I've played 7,072 official minutes,</i>

36:41.766 --> 36:44.792
<i>probably 20,000 or 30,000 unofficial.</i>

36:46.504 --> 36:50.838
<i>But for 32 minutes this season,</i>
<i>over the course of two games,</i>

36:52.143 --> 36:55.078
<i>I did not compete to the best of my ability.</i>

36:55.680 --> 36:57.511
<i>I regret this.</i>

36:57.582 --> 37:00.949
<i>I regret that the fear</i>
<i>of losing the opportunity</i>

37:01.018 --> 37:04.215
<i>to continue playing the game</i>
<i>that I've always loved</i>

37:04.288 --> 37:05.687
<i>prevented me from standing up</i>

37:05.756 --> 37:09.157
<i>and taking full responsibility</i>
<i>for this sooner.</i>

37:09.360 --> 37:13.558
<i>I apologize to my coach,</i>
<i>to my teammates,</i>

37:13.631 --> 37:15.895
<i>to all the kids who look up to me.</i>

37:15.967 --> 37:17.935
<i>Especially to the kids.</i>

37:19.270 --> 37:24.173
<i>While I never lost a game on purpose,</i>
<i>the truth is still the truth.</i>

37:24.242 --> 37:26.904
<i>You can spin it,</i>
<i>you can shade it, you can bend it,</i>

37:26.978 --> 37:30.311
<i>but there's still right and wrong,</i>

37:30.915 --> 37:33.042
<i>and I was wrong.</i>

37:33.117 --> 37:37.850
<i>And the truth is, I've forsaken a game</i>
<i>that's always been incredibly good to me</i>

37:37.922 --> 37:40.948
<i>and teammates</i>
<i>that have been like brothers</i>

37:42.326 --> 37:44.886
<i>and a brother that was a teammate.</i>

37:46.097 --> 37:49.362
<i>To my coach, my wife,</i>

37:50.568 --> 37:52.934
<i>my father and my family,</i>

37:53.004 --> 37:56.269
<i>I apologize for the burden</i>
<i>I know this will bring.</i>

37:57.041 --> 38:01.102
<i>I know that the integrity of the game</i>
<i>cannot be compromised.</i>

38:02.313 --> 38:05.612
<i>I regret that my own integrity</i>
<i>was not as steadfast.</i>

38:06.384 --> 38:09.478
<i>I'm deeply remorseful</i>
<i>for the choices I made,</i>

38:10.921 --> 38:15.358
<i>but I will accept</i>
<i>whatever consequences there might be.</i>

38:15.860 --> 38:17.919
<i>I love this game</i>

38:18.796 --> 38:21.458
<i>and I'm sorry I betrayed it.</i>

38:45.222 --> 38:46.814
Brooke.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.321
You loved your room, Peyton.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.026
And maybe, like you said,
that's been taken from you,

38:54.098 --> 38:56.362
but we're gonna take it back.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.769
We're gonna take everything back.

40:07.471 --> 40:08.563
Dan?

40:09.874 --> 40:12.843
I've done some horrible things,

40:13.477 --> 40:15.877
unforgivable things.

40:19.216 --> 40:22.777
Lucas didn't need a father. He had one.

40:24.922 --> 40:28.653
He had a person who helped erase
the shame of my cowardice.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.589
Everything I've touched, I've diminished.

40:33.664 --> 40:36.428
Deb's life. Nathan's talent.

40:40.137 --> 40:41.297
Keith.

40:41.372 --> 40:44.808
Look, you are not without redemption.
I've seen it.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.503
- I see it.
- That's not true.

40:47.912 --> 40:52.781
It's not true. I just wanna...
I wanna go back, you know?

40:52.850 --> 40:55.819
I just wanna go back. I wanna take
that little kid that I used to be

40:55.886 --> 41:00.186
and just grab him and shake him and say,
"You stop! Stop! Just stop!"

41:00.825 --> 41:04.693
I wanna wake up from this nightmare,
you know? I wanna breathe again.

41:04.762 --> 41:08.596
I wanna... I wanna breathe again, Karen.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.131
Can you help me breathe?

41:11.202 --> 41:14.467
Can you help me quiet these voices
in my head that tell me I've lost you?

41:14.538 --> 41:16.699
Because I know that I have.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.235
If only I would've stayed with you.

41:36.594 --> 41:40.462
<i>Truth is still absolute. Believe that.</i>

41:41.298 --> 41:46.326
<i>Even when that truth is hard and cold</i>
<i>and more painful than you ever imagined,</i>

41:47.738 --> 41:52.141
<i>and even when truth is more cruel</i>
<i>than any lie.</i>
