I'm proud of you
and I'm worried
about Mom, you know,

03:03.125 --> 03:05.917
but at the end of the day,
this isn't really about me.

03:05.917 --> 03:08.458
Well, sure, it is.
I mean, you're part
of this family.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.542
When I think about it,
my parents have been married

03:11.542 --> 03:13.375
for way longer than
most of my friends' parents,

03:13.375 --> 03:15.291
so in that way
I'm actually really lucky.

03:15.291 --> 03:18.041
We're really not talking
about divorce right now.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.667
What do you mean?

03:19.667 --> 03:22.667
I mean, staying married
is not off the table.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.000
People have all kinds
of arrangements.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.917
So you finally get the courage
to come out of the closet

03:27.917 --> 03:30.333
and you're gonna
stay married to a woman?

03:30.333 --> 03:32.166
Okay, that makes
no fucking sense.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.625
It works for some people.

03:33.625 --> 03:37.000
You know, I just saw
a documentary about a guy,
a man who was gay,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.250
and they had grown kids
and his wife knew.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.625
Worked for them.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.750
Are you talking about
"The Staircase"?

03:43.750 --> 03:45.625
'Cause in that, he--
he killed his wife,

03:45.625 --> 03:48.125
so in a sense
it didn't work
for them at all.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.500
You don't know
everything, okay?

03:49.500 --> 03:50.792
Basically,
you're a child.

03:50.792 --> 03:51.959
I'm actually not a child.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.917
I have way more experience
with this stuff than you do.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.417
- You-- oh, really?
- Yes, really.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.125
I was in a relationship
with a gay man,

03:58.125 --> 04:00.959
we broke up,
and I've been navigating
the choppy waters ever since.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.458
You're a child,
basically, okay?

04:02.458 --> 04:03.959
I bet you didn't even
bring your wallet, did you?

04:03.959 --> 04:05.542
Am I right?
Did you bring
your wallet here?

04:05.542 --> 04:07.417
- I brought my wallet here.
- Oh? Let me see it, then.

04:07.417 --> 04:11.792
No, I'm not gonna
show you my wallet
for this stupid game.

04:11.792 --> 04:16.166
Let me see your wallet
if you're such a grown-up.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.083
( muffled )
I came right from the gym.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.166
( laughing )

04:19.166 --> 04:22.166
- You don't have to laugh.
- ( laughs )

04:25.834 --> 04:27.959
That's right.
That's what Jeremy told me.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.500
- Wait, it's not true.
- Yeah, he's going.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.208
Cleo?

04:32.208 --> 04:34.500
'Sup, "Whore-vath"?

04:34.500 --> 04:36.166
Can I have
a quick word with you?

04:37.250 --> 04:40.667
Just a quick word?

04:40.667 --> 04:43.208
- What?
- ( quietly )
What's going on?

04:43.208 --> 04:46.125
I sent you, like,
10 texts this weekend
and called you three times.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.834
You didn't answer
any of it.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.041
Well, my phone must
have run out of power.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.250
Well, your Instagram
told a pretty different
story, Cleo.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.041
I know that you and Jake
were out in Prospect Park
and he made you a flower crown.

04:55.041 --> 04:58.041
- Okay, I'm sorry.
It's not a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.959
I'm going through
some very intense stuff
with my family, okay?

05:00.959 --> 05:04.041
Kind of cosmic, heavy stuff,
and I needed to talk to you

05:04.041 --> 05:05.583
and you weren't there.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.083
You're being
really intense.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.166
So your dad is gay.
So what?

05:09.166 --> 05:10.291
I knew you checked
your phone.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.333
My friend Thomas
has, like, four dads,

05:12.333 --> 05:14.750
so you need to check
your homophobia.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.500
My homophobia?

05:16.500 --> 05:19.959
Cleo, I'm like the least
homophobic person
you've ever met.

05:19.959 --> 05:22.208
I've had sex
with a gay man.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.625
Well, then, why are
you yelling at me?

05:23.625 --> 05:24.875
I'm not yelling at you.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.291
Why are you being
such a B-I-T-C-H?

05:27.291 --> 05:28.875
Are you calling me
a bitch?

05:28.875 --> 05:31.542
You're being kind of a bitch,
so what am I supposed to say?

05:31.542 --> 05:33.000
You know what?
You're kinda psycho.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.708
- I'm psycho?
- Yeah.

05:34.708 --> 05:36.917
Well, maybe I am psycho
'cause it was psychotic of me

05:36.917 --> 05:39.125
to choose you
as a mentee and confidant.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.083
Sorry your parents suck.
Everybody's parents suck.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.333
Welcome to reality.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.834
What the eff would you know
about reality, Cleo?

05:44.834 --> 05:47.583
What'd you ever learn
on the mean streets of Park--

05:47.583 --> 05:51.166
- Cleo, I believe
you have a class.
- Yeah, sorry.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.083
Miss Horvath,
let's adjourn
to my office, please.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.875
I thought
we were friends, Cleo.

05:55.875 --> 05:58.166
Friends who could talk
about things, real things.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.083
Principal:
Hannah.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.333
I think I know
what you're gonna say,
Principal Toby,

06:03.333 --> 06:04.750
and I absolutely
agree with you.

06:04.750 --> 06:08.041
I should've saved that
conversation with Cleo
for after school hours.

06:08.041 --> 06:12.250
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes, or not at all, maybe.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.708
Well, yeah, but would it
have really been fair

06:13.708 --> 06:17.250
to her or to me
to keep all my feelings
stuffed inside?

06:17.250 --> 06:18.625
I don't think so.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.125
Look, Hannah,
you've been a great sub.

06:20.125 --> 06:24.000
You know, you really
connect with the kids
academically, socially,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.959
and you've got them
excited about learning.

06:25.959 --> 06:28.041
I think it's because
I really remember

06:28.041 --> 06:29.458
what it was like
to be a kid myself.

06:29.458 --> 06:33.041
But the thing you have
to remember is you're
not a kid anymore.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.458
No, I mean, of course
I'm not a kid.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.792
The things I've seen
in my life,

06:35.792 --> 06:37.250
it's not suitable
for a child's eyes.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.125
But, see, the thing is
you need to be mindful

06:40.125 --> 06:42.125
of... boundaries.

06:42.125 --> 06:43.291
Yes.

06:43.291 --> 06:47.041
And concentrate
on not going past
the boundary.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.834
Okay, I think the reason
that's been hard for me
this week

06:49.834 --> 06:53.417
is because my father recently
came out of the closet
as a proud gay man.

06:53.417 --> 06:54.667
Ooh, whoa.
Exactly.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.792
That's exactly
the kind of boundary
I'm talking about.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.041
You and I are coworkers.
I'm your boss.

07:01.041 --> 07:03.333
That's something
I don't want to know
anything about.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.834
You think I wanted
to know anything about it?

07:04.834 --> 07:06.792
I mean, that is
a child's worst nightmare.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.875
It's not a homophobia thing.
It's just imagining your parent

07:08.875 --> 07:11.959
in a sexual situation
of any kind is brutalizing.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.834
Right, but see...
( sighs )

07:13.834 --> 07:16.166
...you're an adult
and I know it sucks,

07:16.166 --> 07:19.291
but you just have to
start at least trying

07:19.291 --> 07:23.834
to keep at least
some stuff inside.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.000
Are you gonna fire me?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.667
Look, you got
a lot of stuff going on.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.333
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off

07:32.333 --> 07:37.250
so you can, you know,
deal with whatever
those issues are?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.750
You mean like my father
coming out of the closet

07:38.750 --> 07:40.500
as a proud gay man
in his late 50s.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.917
( laughs )
Again, don't want to know,
didn't need to know.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.417
Boundaries.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.542
I love your jeans.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.291
Boundaries.

07:53.291 --> 07:56.208
Ugh, this tastes
like boiled butter
and not in the good way.

07:56.208 --> 07:59.125
Look, you're the one
who wanted to day drink,
so just man up.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.750
- Okay.
- So...

08:00.750 --> 08:03.125
what did Tad have
to say for himself?

08:03.125 --> 08:05.875
- Um...
- Also, real quick
before you start,

08:05.875 --> 08:07.083
I told you so.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.875
I just wanted to get that
out of the way.

08:08.875 --> 08:09.959
Continue.

08:09.959 --> 08:11.542
You didn't tell me so.

08:11.542 --> 08:14.208
- Beg your pardon?
- You didn't tell me so.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.875
I'm sorry, I seem to recall
actually saying to your face

08:17.875 --> 08:19.250
that your father
was a homosexual.

08:19.250 --> 08:23.250
- Yeah, but you think
everyone's a homosexual.
- Most people are.

08:23.250 --> 08:27.583
- You told me
Barack Obama was gay.
- He reads bi.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.250
I don't know.
My dad keeps saying

08:29.250 --> 08:30.917
that he thinks
they're gonna stay together.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.625
- Your poor mom.
- And I said to him,

08:32.625 --> 08:34.125
"Why would you want
to come out of the closet

08:34.125 --> 08:36.041
after a thousand years
and then stay with Mom?"

08:36.041 --> 08:38.000
And he said, "You don't
understand anything."

08:38.000 --> 08:40.332
Look, it's very scary
to come out.

08:40.332 --> 08:42.207
So I'm sure he's
just coming out in chunks,

08:42.207 --> 08:45.417
you know, like--
like, I said for a while
that I was bisexual.

08:45.417 --> 08:48.542
We all know
that was a lie,
but it's scary,

08:48.542 --> 08:50.917
so I'm sure right now
he's probably telling you

08:50.917 --> 08:52.250
that it's just
all in his head

08:52.250 --> 08:53.708
and he's never
done anything, right?

08:53.708 --> 08:56.458
- He said
he's never done anything.
- Yeah, well, that's a lie.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.875
- Is it?
- Fuck, yeah,
it's a lie.

08:58.875 --> 09:02.625
I would bet my house seats
to "If/Then" that, like,
in one month,

09:02.625 --> 09:06.125
he's gonna be like,
"Well, I did have this
college roommate

09:06.125 --> 09:09.208
and we did have feelings
for each other, but we
never did anything."

09:09.208 --> 09:10.917
And then-- and then
in, like, two months,

09:10.917 --> 09:13.959
he's gonna be like,
"Oh, yeah, I got my
fucking ass pounded

09:13.959 --> 09:16.417
by our insurance
adjuster last year."

09:16.417 --> 09:19.417
No, I'm trying so hard
to be open and accepting,

09:19.417 --> 09:20.959
but you can't say stuff
like that about my dad.

09:20.959 --> 09:24.792
My point is--
is that I'm sure him saying
they're gonna stay together

09:24.792 --> 09:27.458
is just like
a stutter step.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.667
I'm just--
I'm worried about him.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.000
He's so lost.
I feel terrible.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.291
He doesn't have
anyone to talk to.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.959
- Mm.
- He doesn't have
any community.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.125
I don't know,
I just wish that he had,

09:37.125 --> 09:39.208
like, a group he could join
or some friends.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.959
I'm sure the gays
in Michigan are terrible.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.500
I can't even imagine.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.333
It's a lot of cargo pants,

- Hey, Shosh.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.083
I think we're good
with the balloons
and the bunting.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.250
I mean, can you imagine
how all this is gonna--

09:59.250 --> 10:00.959
- what if I lose?
- You're not gonna lose.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.834
You're Ray Ploshansky.
Let's take back the borough.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.166
- I just don't want
you to get too excited.
- Okay, seriously, Ray,

10:05.166 --> 10:07.000
what else do I have to do
with my life right now?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.375
The job interviews
have dried up,

10:08.375 --> 10:09.875
nobody's buying
what I'm selling.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.083
I couldn't get hired to
give away free blowjobs
at a bus station.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.500
So I'm gonna
bask in your glory
a little bit, yes.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.041
Okay, all right.
I'm sorry, all right?

10:16.041 --> 10:17.166
I'm just
a little nervous here.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.375
I'm sure you can
appreciate that.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.125
I'm nervous and...

10:21.125 --> 10:22.875
I just--
I really want this.

10:22.875 --> 10:27.000
Yeah, and what
Ray Ploshansky wants,
Ray Ploshansky gets.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.875
Except for me.
Or Marnie.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.333
Really any woman
you've ever loved.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.708
- Okay.
- But now,
if you'll excuse me,

10:32.708 --> 10:34.208
there is a cake
with your face on it

10:34.208 --> 10:36.458
that ended up looking
a little bit more like
Muammar Qaddafi,

10:36.458 --> 10:39.208
so I'm gonna do
some damage control
frostingwise.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.917
I just don't understand
why you'd want to stay with him.

10:43.917 --> 10:47.041
It's a very
confusing time.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.458
I'm sure
you're confused,
too, right, sweets?

10:49.458 --> 10:52.875
Um, I mean, I'm okay.
I'm mostly just worried
about you guys.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.708
You're okay?
I mean, how can you be okay?

10:55.708 --> 10:57.542
Your life is falling apart.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.041
It's basically
all been a lie, Hannah.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.875
I mean, I guess so,
but it kind of sounds

11:01.875 --> 11:04.250
more like you're talking
about your life than mine.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.166
( laughing )
You are so right.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.583
Jesus, what the fuck
do I know, right?

11:08.583 --> 11:11.583
- Mom.
- I mean, why are you
asking for life advice

11:11.583 --> 11:15.917
from a woman who obviously
doesn't know anything
about anything?

11:15.917 --> 11:17.417
I didn't ask
for life advice.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.542
Everything I have ever
told you about anything,

11:19.542 --> 11:21.583
I want you to disregard it.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.083
What the fuck do I know?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.458
Who gives a shit,
anyway?

11:24.458 --> 11:26.750
Maybe you should call
Janet from next door

11:26.750 --> 11:27.917
and have her
come sit with you.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.417
And you guys can,
you know,

11:29.417 --> 11:31.041
look at some magazines
or something.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.959
Where is your dad
right now, anyway, huh?

11:32.959 --> 11:34.625
Christopher Street
or something?

11:34.625 --> 11:36.750
That's not even where
gay people hang out anymore.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.750
Charles,
my student who's gay,

11:38.750 --> 11:41.834
thinks that your dad
is gonna be a daddy.

11:41.834 --> 11:45.542
( laughs )
Your dad is gonna
be a daddy.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.041
I mean, do you think
he's gonna be a daddy,
Hannah?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.000
What?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.792
Do you think
he's gonna be a daddy?

11:50.792 --> 11:52.792
Mom, you know what?
I'm gonna call Janet, okay?

11:52.792 --> 11:55.291
You just sit tight
and I'm gonna call Janet.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.875
Don't call Janet.
She doesn't get any of this.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.375
She doesn't get
the whole thing

11:59.375 --> 12:01.250
about sucking dick
or anything.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.625
None of it.
She really doesn't.

12:02.625 --> 12:06.166
You're making--
you're making me
uncomfortable.

12:06.166 --> 12:10.208
Think about anal sex!
Now that's uncomfortable.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.834
- Okay, hey, I'm in heels.
- Run with me! Run with me!

12:11.834 --> 12:13.708
I'm in heels, hold on.
Whoo!

12:13.708 --> 12:15.500
- Ah!
- Run faster!

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
Do you see
what's on my feet?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.250
- ( laughing )
- Stop.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.208
Oh, my God.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.375
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.708
So what is this place
we're going to?

12:24.708 --> 12:27.166
- Like, Moroccan food?
- Ethiopian.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.625
- Oh, nice.
- It's my friend's restaurant.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.625
I photographed her breasts
for a project on globalization.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.500
Holy shit.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.750
What?

12:36.750 --> 12:39.250
We're right
by Mimi-Rose's place.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.667
Cool.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.375
Should we head up there
and see what she and Adam
are doing?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.291
Uh, why?

12:45.291 --> 12:47.667
That-- wouldn't that
be weird for you?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.041
No.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.166
We're all grown-ups.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.959
Yeah, we-- yeah, okay.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.542
Just for, like, a minute.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.542
No, no, I'll walk
behind you.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.166
Whoo!

13:00.333 --> 13:01.667
Hello.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.875
What's up?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.834
- How are you, man?
- I'm good, I'm good.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.041
Good.
Oh, we were literally

13:06.041 --> 13:08.125
just walking
down your street
on our way to dinner

13:08.125 --> 13:10.583
and I thought about
this fucking blue door.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.792
Colored doors
are a reason to live.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.333
( quietly )
Adam, is this a good time?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.708
Were you about to, like,
make love or take a shit?

13:21.708 --> 13:24.375
No, no, but Mimi-Rose
is in the shower.

13:24.375 --> 13:25.792
But you can come in.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.417
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.875
Okay.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.667
Jessa, come here.
I want to show you

13:30.667 --> 13:33.041
this herb garden I planted
when I lived here.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.583
Oh, okay.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.291
I do love an herb.

13:39.792 --> 13:44.542
Oh, okay-- oh, yeah,
it's still there.

13:44.542 --> 13:45.917
Ace:
It's still there
'cause I planted it

13:45.917 --> 13:47.166
and it's amazing
in the sunshine.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.792
- Hey, guys.
- Mm-hmm.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.750
Mimi-Rose:
This is a surprise.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.542
Yeah?
Fun one or scary one?

13:53.542 --> 13:55.792
Fu-scary.

13:55.792 --> 13:59.083
I was just about to tell them
that we're about to head out.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.667
Jessa:
We actually, uh--
we're going to dinner now.

14:01.667 --> 14:07.166
Uh, Ace's friend
with the tits is, uh,
gonna be expecting us

14:07.166 --> 14:08.750
and we just wanted
to say hi.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.208
And now that
we've said hi,
we can say bye.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.917
- Oh, okay, great.
- No, stay.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.250
Adam, would you
fry up some sausages?

14:17.250 --> 14:18.542
Sure, I'll fry up
some sausages.

14:18.542 --> 14:21.708
Everybody here
like sausages?

14:21.708 --> 14:23.917
Yeah.

14:23.917 --> 14:27.417
I remember in '89,
they didn't even finish
counting the ballots

14:27.417 --> 14:28.834
till 3:00 AM
in the morning.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.917
Wow. Well, yeah,
I imagine you get
big turnouts like that

14:30.917 --> 14:32.750
when your choices
are so stark, right?

14:32.750 --> 14:35.667
I mean, Dinkins, Giuliani.
It's like night and day.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.208
Don't even talk to me
about Dinkins.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.750
It was all about us
till he won.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.125
Then it was
all about them.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.125
Wait, what does
that mean?

14:45.125 --> 14:47.291
- You know.
- Oh, don't listen to him.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.417
In the '90s,
he was met with reverses.

14:49.417 --> 14:51.041
Mind your
own business, Kippy.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.166
Mm.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.083
- This is it.
- Whoa.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.208
- ( music playing )
- Marnie: Look at this.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.875
- Hey, sweetie?
- Yeah?

14:59.875 --> 15:04.083
I think we should,
uh, maybe not tell anyone
about our little secret yet.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.583
Oh, baby,
don't worry about it.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.959
I am a very private person.
You know that.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.417
I do. Good.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.458
I just-- I want it
to be our special thing
for a little while longer.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.083
I love that.
I love that idea.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.208
Ooh, secrets
are so sexy.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.708
( laughs )

15:16.708 --> 15:17.750
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.500
- What's up?
- Nothing.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.417
Nothing new
having to do with me.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
Okay.
Pizza?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
- Um, no, thank you.
- No, thanks.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.125
It looks great, Shosh.
Congrats.

15:27.125 --> 15:29.834
- Thank you.
- Good job.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.000
Um, I-- why don't you go
get us something to drink?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.291
I'm gonna
go say hi to Ray.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.667
- All right.
- I love you.

15:35.667 --> 15:40.125
♪ Happy birthday,
Mr. President... ♪

15:40.125 --> 15:42.166
- Marilyn Monroe.
- Yeah, I know.

15:42.166 --> 15:44.333
- Got the reference.
- Good.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.166
I wasn't gonna
tell anyone this,

15:47.166 --> 15:49.333
but I have some news.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.708
Yeah?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.000
Is that
what I think it is?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.417
I'm getting married.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.583
- You and Desi?
- Yes.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.583
- Wow.
- I know.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.959
- Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.708
- Thank you so much.
- I'm just--

16:07.708 --> 16:09.542
- You're the first person
I'm telling.
- Really?

16:09.542 --> 16:10.792
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm honored.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.959
I wanted to tell you
'cause I feel very
close to you.

16:12.959 --> 16:15.458
And you really held my hand
through this whole thing,

16:15.458 --> 16:18.458
and I feel like you
helped me see it through
to its logical conclusion.

16:18.458 --> 16:21.125
And also I just wanted
to make sure it wasn't
gonna be weird.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.125
( laughs )
Are you kidding, Marn?
This is perfect.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.291
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, good.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.458
Yeah, no, this
is the right move

16:25.458 --> 16:26.708
at the right time
for you, absolutely.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.083
- This is a slam dunk.
- Ray, thank you.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.583
- Yeah, I mean it.
- I was most nervous
about your reaction.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.667
No.
Reverse windmill slam dunk.
Where's the lucky guy?

16:32.667 --> 16:33.875
Desi, come on over here!

16:33.875 --> 16:35.667
- Hey, Des.
- Come here.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.834
Look at this guy.
Luckiest guy on the planet.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.834
She just told me
the good news, man.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.375
- What? Marnie.
- I know.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.583
- She couldn't help it,
she couldn't help it.
- I was so excited.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.750
It's really exciting.
Amazing, right?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.000
- It's crazy.
- Unbelievable.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.250
- Oh, we're so happy.
- So happy for you guys.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.458
- Oh, thank you, Ray.
Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.208
You done good, my friend.
You done real good.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.625
You'll make an honest woman
out of the trollop.

16:54.625 --> 16:57.750
- What is that?
- That's my future wife
you're talking about.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.333
- Yeah, future...
- Oh, my God.
Future wife.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.750
Yeah.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.375
- ( sighs )
- Yeah.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.083
( Elijah laughing )
Oh, this guy was...

17:08.083 --> 17:09.750
Tad:
We're gonna get together.
I just haven't called yet.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.834
- Hannah,
look what I did.
- You sure did.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.834
Elijah:
Ah, look.
Doesn't he look great?

17:14.834 --> 17:18.083
He's such a daddy.
I told you he'd be
such a daddy.

17:18.083 --> 17:21.000
Whatever you say, Elijah.
I defer, I defer.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.875
- ( laughs )
- Yeah, you look great.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.416
Here we go.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.375
I'm sorry, this is all
just a little much
for me right now.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.083
I can't go
through this again.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.750
- Is it the cuffs?
- No.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.792
I think it's more
just you being called "daddy"

17:35.792 --> 17:37.583
over and over again
in a sexual way

17:37.583 --> 17:39.083
when you're,
you know, my daddy.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.959
Oh, Banana,
I know it's hard.
It is for me, too.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.000
I don't have a problem
with you being gay, okay?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.458
- I'm a famous liberal, okay?
- Of course you are.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.625
My beliefs perfectly align
with having a gay father.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.375
I know.
I mean, remember
the picture we took

17:50.375 --> 17:52.125
with you and Hillary Clinton
when you were a little girl?

17:52.125 --> 17:53.792
- Yes.
- She loved you.

17:53.792 --> 17:57.083
( sighs )
It's okay to feel
confused, Hannah.

17:57.083 --> 18:00.500
Um, you can
ask me anything.
Maybe that'll help.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.125
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

18:02.125 --> 18:05.250
Okay, honey.
Okay.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.750
- Okay, I would like
to ask you one thing.
- Sure.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.708
I think it's important
for me to know--

18:09.708 --> 18:11.917
- have you ever
been with a man?
- No.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.542
- Tad.
- Okay.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.125
There was, uh, one guy
in my senior year.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.917
It was mostly
dry humping.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.333
( sighs )

18:19.333 --> 18:21.125
Okay, that's good
information to have.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.333
I can work with
that information.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.000
You know,
I always wondered
what happened to him.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Turns out
he's in commercial
real estate now.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.125
- Great.
- Yeah.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.667
I helped him do
some Facebook sleuthing.

18:28.667 --> 18:31.834
We reconnected,
so, you know,

18:31.834 --> 18:33.583
who knows what
the future holds?

18:33.583 --> 18:36.000
- Full-on anal.
- Gross.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.250
- Seriously, you guys?
- Hannah, come on.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.583
I'm trying so hard
to be cool about this,

18:39.583 --> 18:41.667
but you are not
making it easy.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.375
Okay, you're my dad.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.917
I don't want to hear
about you having sex
with anyone.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.417
I don't want to hear
about you having sex
with Mom.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.000
- Okay.
- I don't want
to hear about you

18:49.000 --> 18:51.041
dry-humping some guy,
and I don't want to be made

18:51.041 --> 18:52.625
to feel like some
self-involved asshole

18:52.625 --> 18:54.458
because I'm
a little discombobulated.

18:54.458 --> 18:57.708
I think what you two need
are some serious...

18:57.708 --> 18:59.041
boundaries.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.041
And if you'll excuse me,
I have a political event
to attend.

19:03.041 --> 19:07.041
- Banana, honey...
- ( door opens, closes )

19:08.917 --> 19:10.708
Adam:
Okay, is everyone done
with their sausages?

19:10.708 --> 19:12.000
'Cause I'd like
to clear our plates.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.375
Mimi-Rose:
I'm sorry, I'm just
distracted right now

19:14.375 --> 19:15.667
by these feelings
of jealousy--

19:15.667 --> 19:18.291
that you two
are apparently
together now?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.375
- Okay.
- It's not serious.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.083
Yeah, well,
maybe not yet.

19:22.083 --> 19:25.291
It might not be serious yet,
but Jessa really wants
to have babies.

19:25.291 --> 19:29.250
- I do?
- And she has an incredibly
nurturing instinct.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.667
And I am so fucking excited
to see where this is going.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.417
You have no idea.

19:34.417 --> 19:37.250
Mimi-Rose:
Wow, so this is what
jealousy is, huh?

19:37.250 --> 19:40.750
I guess I've never really
experienced it before.

19:40.750 --> 19:44.041
Well, you know,
we-- we could go.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.500
Ace: I think that
the better choice would be

19:45.500 --> 19:47.750
to stay here
and talk about this,
don't you, love?

19:47.750 --> 19:50.417
Um, yeah,
okay, Jesus.

19:50.417 --> 19:53.625
I mean, this involves--
Adam, you wanna join
this convo, buddy?

19:53.625 --> 19:55.542
No, I'm good
with my sponge.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.500
Adam, I think it's
really important for you
and for us as a couple.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.750
Oh, my fucking God.
I'm sorry, I'm trying
really hard,

20:01.750 --> 20:04.083
but the last fucking time
I saw this fucking jabroni,

20:04.083 --> 20:06.583
he was telling me that
I was just a passing phase
in your life

20:06.583 --> 20:07.917
and that he was gonna
get you back eventually,

20:07.917 --> 20:10.125
so sorry if I'm not
so interested in this
conversation.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.792
Clearly I'm not the only one
who's experiencing feelings
of jealousy.

20:13.792 --> 20:14.959
But on the other hand,

20:14.959 --> 20:17.834
I can't deny that
I really want Ace back.

20:19.625 --> 20:20.750
What?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.792
Don't fucking say it
if you don't fucking mean it.

20:22.792 --> 20:23.917
And you know
I'm not kidding.

20:23.917 --> 20:27.083
Oh, my God.
This is officially
bullshit now.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.125
No, no, no.
You came over.
You can't go anywhere.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.792
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving because
you are full of shit

20:31.792 --> 20:33.542
and I know exactly
what you're doing

20:33.542 --> 20:35.625
and I'm not gonna be
a pawn in your game.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.959
I fucking run game.

20:36.959 --> 20:39.542
And you are full of shit
in a different way.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.959
I don't even know
what that way is,

20:40.959 --> 20:44.542
but I'm sure you'll probably
make some really shitty art
about it.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.917
And you're a sucker,
just like me.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.500
And if you have
any sense at all,

20:48.500 --> 20:51.792
you'll leave with me right now
and never look back.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.583
I guess there's only
one right choice,
isn't there?

20:55.583 --> 20:58.166
You know what?
No one cares, you bitch.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.333
What is the right choice,
Mimi-Rose, huh?

21:00.333 --> 21:01.667
What is it?

21:01.667 --> 21:03.500
Tell me what
the choice is.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.959
I choose...

21:05.959 --> 21:08.834
to be alone.
I choose no one.

21:08.834 --> 21:09.917
What?

21:09.917 --> 21:12.000
What the fuck
are you talking about?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.333
Oh, my God.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.083
- Adam, let's go.
- Ace: Jessa, don't go.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.542
I-I really am ready
to be with you now.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.750
This roller coaster's
really brought me
back to you.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.250

21:24.250 --> 21:27.041

- ♪ Our new leader. ♪

Yeah? Yeah?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.792
Hey, hey, hey,
do you like your cake?

21:37.792 --> 21:39.083
Yeah, it looks amazing.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.291
Yeah? I think you look
really handsome.

21:40.291 --> 21:41.875
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.
- Mm-hmm.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.375
You look a little like
Mister Rogers, but it's okay.

21:43.375 --> 21:47.208
Hi, thanks
so much for coming.
Good to see you.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.542

Yeah.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.041
Well, I guess
I'm here to concede.

21:59.041 --> 22:02.458
You won,
fair and square.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.250
Thanks, Ted.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.542
I appreciate it
and I, um,

22:06.542 --> 22:08.208
you know, hope
we can work together

22:08.208 --> 22:10.875
to see through
some of the good initiatives
you've been shepherding.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.542
Fuck that.
I'm moving to Katonah.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.417
All these whining whack jobs
are your problem now, pal.

22:16.417 --> 22:19.208
- Well, onwards
and upwards, right?
- Yeah, whatever.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.583
Is that--
is that free booze?

22:20.583 --> 22:22.500
- Test, one, two.
- No, it's--

22:22.500 --> 22:23.792
it's not free booze,
actually.

22:23.792 --> 22:26.583
- Figures.
- Shoshanna: Mic, one, two.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.959
Um, ahem.

22:28.959 --> 22:32.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me in welcoming

22:32.708 --> 22:37.250
your new chairperson
for community board
number eight,

22:37.250 --> 22:38.834
Mr. Ray Ploshansky.

22:38.834 --> 22:42.750
- ( cheering )
- We're taking
the borough back!

22:43.625 --> 22:45.208
Thank you.

22:45.208 --> 22:49.125
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for your support.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.750
- Ray, get on the chair.
- Huh?

22:50.750 --> 22:52.583
- Get on the chair.
- Oh, you want me-- okay.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.291
- Get on the chair.
- All right.

22:54.291 --> 22:57.041
- ( cheering )
- We don't-- we don't
need to do it again.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.667
Thank you, Miss Shapiro,
for that stirring introduction,

22:59.667 --> 23:02.458
for all of your
support and guidance
during this campaign.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.917
I couldn't have done this
without you.

23:03.917 --> 23:08.291
Um, I'd like to begin
with a quote.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.875
As Ralph Nader
once said,

23:10.875 --> 23:13.333
"When strangers
start acting like neighbors,

23:13.333 --> 23:16.792
communities
are reinvigorated."

23:16.792 --> 23:18.834
- End quote.
- Marnie: Nice!

23:22.458 --> 23:25.291
Okay, you know,
I-- uh-- I'm gonna--

23:25.291 --> 23:27.500
I-- s-some of you
probably already know,

23:27.500 --> 23:30.083
this has been a--
a big year for me,

23:30.083 --> 23:33.083
full of ups,
full of downs,

23:33.083 --> 23:35.291
chock-full of surprises.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.417
But as we move forward,
I ask you to remember this:

23:42.834 --> 23:45.667
we're at our best
when we're together.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.875
Even if it doesn't seem
like a perfect fit,

23:48.875 --> 23:53.041
even if the path is laden
with obstacles, frustrations,

23:53.041 --> 23:55.083
we need to work
to understand each other.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.417
- Woman: Yep.
- Woman #2: Yep.

23:56.417 --> 24:00.208
And to listen to each other
and ultimately to love
each other.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.834
I guess what
I'm trying to say here

24:05.834 --> 24:08.000
is none of us has
a crystal ball, right?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.667
No one knows
what the future holds,
but when you need me,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.375
please know
that I'll be here.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.375
If you take
a wrong turn,
I'll be here.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.875
If you get stuck in a rut
and you can't get out,
I'll be here.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.959
If you feel like
there's no one else
on this planet

24:21.959 --> 24:23.333
that you can talk to,
I'll be here.

24:23.333 --> 24:26.917
Whatever happens,
please know that I promise

24:26.917 --> 24:31.208
to always,
always be here.

24:34.458 --> 24:35.875
Whatever, dickhead.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.291
( scattered laughter )

24:37.291 --> 24:38.708
All right,
thanks again for coming.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.708
And, uh, let's take
the borough back!

24:40.708 --> 24:42.333

25:01.792 --> 25:02.959
Uh, how did it go?

25:02.959 --> 25:05.542
Um, yes, it was humble,
but still stirring.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.000
Do you want some cake?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.250
Um, I'm okay.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.000
I feel weird
eating Ray's face.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.458
I'm not really...

25:14.417 --> 25:15.917
in the mood.

25:17.417 --> 25:19.333
Well, you can't--

25:19.333 --> 25:23.083
you can't just, like,
leave a piece that
you touched.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.750
( sighs )

25:28.959 --> 25:31.625
Why didn't you warn me?

25:31.625 --> 25:33.375
That's not my job.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.333
I'm fucking busy.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.500
What'd you see in Ace?

25:41.959 --> 25:45.792
I don't know.
I saw... adventure.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.458
Someone who never
stopped moving.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.625
Didn't give me
a chance to think.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.542
I don't do well
when I think.

26:03.959 --> 26:07.125
I think I don't
want to go in there.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.458
Why?

26:08.458 --> 26:11.291
Are you afraid
to see Hannah?

26:11.291 --> 26:14.041
I think I want to see her
too much right now.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.542
Ahem.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.166
I'm out.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.041
Bye.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.625
Congratulations, Ray.
You really did it.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.834
Thanks.
Yeah, quite a night, huh?

26:37.834 --> 26:39.208
Where's Elijah?

26:39.208 --> 26:43.333
