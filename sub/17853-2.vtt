00:00.267 --> 00:03.469
<i> Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:05.571
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

00:05.573 --> 00:07.106
No.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.474
That's very odd.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.009
There's an opening
in the ground.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.176
<i> Is this the back door?</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.478
That's not natural.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.779
<i> We want to take a look
 at the well.</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:15.381
Down to the water!

00:15.383 --> 00:17.016
<i> Might there be clues
 down there?</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:18.517
What the hell's that?
Do you see that?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.652
- Wow.
- Down slow.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.489
<i> This well may be
 associated with the Templars.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.124
- Whoa!
- What do you got, Tony?

00:25.126 --> 00:27.059
Right here on these rocks,
I've got a triangle.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.627
This thing's amazing.

00:31.399 --> 00:35.034
<i> There is an island
 in the North Atlantic</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:37.770
<i> where people have been looking
 for an incredible treasure</i>

00:37.772 --> 00:40.806
<i> for more than 200 years.</i>

00:40.808 --> 00:45.077
<i> So far, they have found
 bits of gold chain,</i>

00:45.079 --> 00:49.248
<i> a stone slab with strange
 symbols carved into it,</i>

00:49.250 --> 00:52.484
<i> even a 17th century
 Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:56.688
<i> To date, six men have died
 trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:58.125 --> 00:59.825
<i> And, according to legend,</i>

00:59.827 --> 01:03.162
<i> one more will have to die</i>

01:03.164 --> 01:06.565
<i> before the treasure
 can be found.</i>

<i> Jack, why don't you hack
 that tree out of the way.</i>

01:24.785 --> 01:27.486
Wow.
-That's my big discovery.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.322
Well, honestly, David,
that is quite odd.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.493
<i> A few days ago,</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:36.862
<i> during a meeting
 in the war room,</i>

01:36.864 --> 01:40.566
<i> Rick, Marty and members of the
Oak Island team were introduced</i>

01:40.568 --> 01:44.303
<i> to New York based writer
 and researcher Zena Halpern</i>

01:44.305 --> 01:46.672
<i>by area historian Doug Crowell.</i>

01:46.674 --> 01:49.842
Hello?
-Hi, Zena, it's Doug.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.477
I just gave everyone here
a little overview

01:51.479 --> 01:53.712
on what your research involves,

01:53.714 --> 01:57.216
and that you have some
pretty interesting documents.

01:57.218 --> 02:00.252
<i> During their meeting,
 Halpern shared</i>

02:00.254 --> 02:03.455
<i> with the team her discovery of
 three ancient documents,</i>

02:03.457 --> 02:06.825
<i> which she believes prove
 a connection between</i>

02:06.827 --> 02:09.161
<i> the Knights Templar
 and activities on Oak Island</i>

02:09.163 --> 02:13.132
<i> going back as far
 as the 12th century.</i>

02:13.134 --> 02:16.502
We have a map
that shows Nova Scotia.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.871
We have a map of Oak Island.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.440
And then we have the cipher.

02:23.844 --> 02:28.180
<i> One of the maps, dated 1347,</i>

02:28.182 --> 02:31.717
<i> showed various sites
 and landmarks on Oak Island</i>

02:31.719 --> 02:35.154
<i> that match several of
 the places well known to Rick,</i>

02:35.156 --> 02:37.222
<i> Marty and the team.</i>

02:37.224 --> 02:39.791
The hand-drawn map
is clearly Oak Island.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.361
<i> And then there are several
 things, named in French,</i>

02:42.363 --> 02:44.263
<i> which have been translated
 for us.</i>

02:44.265 --> 02:46.165
<i> One is called the basin.</i>

02:46.167 --> 02:48.734
<i> Well, that clearly correlates
 to the swamp.</i>

02:48.736 --> 02:50.869
<i> And then there's something
 on the map which points</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:53.572
<i> right about to where
 the Money Pit is.</i>

02:53.574 --> 02:55.307
And then we have
two or three things

02:55.309 --> 02:57.309
that we don't know
anything about.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.879
<i> One's called "The Anchors,"
 one's called "The Valve,"</i>

03:00.881 --> 03:03.815
<i> and one's called "The Hatch."</i>

03:03.817 --> 03:07.486
<i> When Oak Island
 treasure hunter Jack Begley</i>

03:07.488 --> 03:09.488
<i> later laid a copy of
 Zena Halpern's map</i>

03:09.490 --> 03:12.391
<i> over a satellite image
 of the island...</i>

03:12.393 --> 03:13.492
Look at the top of that.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.494
It follows it perfectly.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.329
<i> ...the so-called "hatch"</i>

03:17.331 --> 03:19.398
<i> matched the location of
 what Dave Blankenship</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:21.667
<i> remembered as the site</i>

03:21.669 --> 03:24.236
<i> of a strange depression
 near his property.</i>

03:24.238 --> 03:27.639
This hatch lands
kind of where David said...

03:27.641 --> 03:29.875
- The hole is.
- Yeah.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.344
What would cause it
to sink in like this?

03:32.346 --> 03:33.545
Something below.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.314
Something gave way below.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.517
If this is a hatch,
it would be a way in,

03:38.519 --> 03:41.286
a vertical shaft
to enter something.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.589
That's very, very odd.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.326
<i> It's hard to explain
 what that is.</i>

03:47.328 --> 03:48.994
It's clearly, I think, a hole

03:48.996 --> 03:52.698
that's been chiseled
into the bedrock by humans.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.567
I don't see any other
explanation for it,

03:55.569 --> 03:56.935
geologically.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.237
All right, Jack,
if you don't mind,

03:58.239 --> 03:59.471
shovel off that gunk down there,

03:59.473 --> 04:00.973
and let's see
what's underneath there.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.510
See that rock
directly ahead of you?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.913
Does that look placed or is that
just part of the bedrock?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.881
This looks like bedrock
for sure.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.452
This isn't laid rock; it's been,
you know, chiseled away.

04:15.990 --> 04:19.291
It sure looks like
it's been chopped away.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.692
It was kind of
an "aha" moment, you know?

04:20.694 --> 04:21.892
Here-here's an opening
in the ground.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.762
<i> Is this the back door?</i>

04:25.933 --> 04:29.368
That's pretty solid there.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.503
It doesn't sound
like rock though.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.472
No, it sounds
sandy or something.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.040
That almost sounded hollow.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.342
Almost sounds like wood.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.977
Holy smokes.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.846
<i> A hollow wooden surface?</i>

04:40.848 --> 04:44.750
<i> In a square hole
 cut through bedrock?</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:47.352
<i> Could Jack be standing
 on a secret doorway,</i>

04:47.354 --> 04:51.456
<i> perhaps one that leads
 directly to the Money Pit?</i>

04:51.458 --> 04:53.925
Does it seem to be
solidifying at all?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.428
Are you hitting a bottom
or is it just bottomless there?

04:56.430 --> 04:59.498
I'm standing on something solid,
but I-I honestly can't tell

04:59.500 --> 05:01.366
until we dig up the rest.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.836
It's just mud in this top part,
and could be anything.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.438
- Yeah, okay.
- Keep going, Jack.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.478
As you look around the sides,
does it appear that

05:13.480 --> 05:15.714
they're nice and solid anywhere?

05:15.716 --> 05:18.684
Well, besides breaking off.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.952
Besides knocking
the rock out.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.990
But no, no large holes
or anything that you can see?

05:24.992 --> 05:26.425
Yeah, that's solid.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.061
Yeah, pretty much.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.331
The middle part kind of
seems to go further.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.601
It's too muddy to be able
to tell if this is the bottom.

05:36.603 --> 05:40.639
It seems to be narrowing,
but at the same time,

05:40.641 --> 05:43.675
I almost feel like it's slate
mixed with mud continuing on.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.812
I don't know if we want to come
back with a different method,

05:46.814 --> 05:48.947
'cause it-- this is, this is
gonna be real slow

05:48.949 --> 05:50.982
from here on out.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.418
The shape is strange;
I mean, that's a given.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.686
Everything's strange about it.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.688
It's not natural.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.657
You know, even taking
an excavator in here,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.392
it would be difficult because

06:00.394 --> 06:01.626
that's been chiseled
down through.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.994
You try and dig right there,

06:02.996 --> 06:05.564
an excavator isn't
gonna pull that up.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.699
It might break it up,
get underneath of it. It might.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.801
- Well...
-You can lose a tooth, too.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.803
Not only lose a tooth,
but if it really is something,

06:11.805 --> 06:13.572
do we really want
to go that route?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.042
I honestly think we should have
that archaeologist guy

06:17.044 --> 06:18.944
- look at it. Yeah, I mean...
- Come look at it?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.813
I don't know what that
is, but an archeologist might.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.383
To me, that is
absolutely man-made

06:24.385 --> 06:25.984
and, um, obviously old.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.919
Yeah, I agree. I totally agree.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.122
We should, we should
get an opinion.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.990
<i> Because this so-called "hatch"</i>

06:31.992 --> 06:34.926
<i> could be
 an important discovery,</i>

06:34.928 --> 06:36.862
<i> Marty and Rick's
 decision to bring in</i>

06:36.864 --> 06:40.165
<i> an archaeologist to examine it
 is a prudent one.</i>

06:40.167 --> 06:41.833
We're not done here;
we-we need to figure out

06:41.835 --> 06:43.168
what's going on,
but, Jack, for right now,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.437
you're done-- nice job.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.841
<i>Canada has certain requirements
for archaeological excavations.</i>

06:49.843 --> 06:53.011
<i> This hatch could be
 significant,</i>

06:53.013 --> 06:56.581
<i>archaeologically, so we want to</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:58.717
follow the rules,
so we bring in an expert.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.585
We're not sure
what this thing is.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.887
<i> So, that's one reason
 to make sure</i>

07:01.889 --> 07:03.855
<i> we're doing the proper thing.</i>

07:03.857 --> 07:06.758
<i> And the other reason is to see
 if he can explain it.</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:09.094
That was not a pleasant job
and you did a nice job.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.996
I don't mind getting dirty,
Marty.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.864
That is why I like
having young people around.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.140
<i> While the team
 waits for the archaeologist</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:25.177
<i> -to arrive...
-Here they are right now.</i>

07:25.179 --> 07:27.579
<i> ...Rick Lagina
 and Jack Begley meet</i>

07:27.581 --> 07:29.581
<i> with representatives from
 Irving Equipment, Limited.</i>

07:29.583 --> 07:30.816
-How's it going?
-Lorne Flowers.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.784
Lorne, nice to meet you.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.487
<i> Having already
 removed all of the old casings</i>

07:35.489 --> 07:39.558
<i> from this year's
 two major target sites,</i>

07:39.560 --> 07:41.760
<i> the Laginas and their partners
 are now ready</i>

07:41.762 --> 07:44.563
<i> to begin the next phase
 of their operation:</i>

07:44.565 --> 07:46.097
<i> the clearing and preparation</i>

07:46.099 --> 07:48.867
<i> of the Money Pit area
 for what promises to be</i>

07:48.869 --> 07:51.536
<i> a massive excavation.</i>

07:51.538 --> 07:53.705
Okay, so, guys,
this is the Money Pit.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.707
This is where the activity
is gonna start.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.009
So why don't we get down

07:58.011 --> 08:00.779
and you guys can do
what you need to do.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.514
-You want to go first?
-We going down here?

08:02.516 --> 08:05.584
<i> There's large equipment
 coming in.</i>

08:05.586 --> 08:07.018
Different types of equipment
need to be staged

08:07.020 --> 08:08.720
in different areas.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.522
<i> There's a lot of things
 to consider.</i>

08:10.524 --> 08:13.158
<i> Because the Money Pit</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:16.027
<i> is susceptible to flooding,
 the Laginas and their partners</i>

08:16.029 --> 08:18.096
<i> have decided to drill two</i>

08:18.098 --> 08:21.867
<i> approximately 40-inch-wide
 steel-reinforced holes</i>

08:21.869 --> 08:24.836
<i> deep into
 the most promising sites.</i>

08:24.838 --> 08:29.207
<i> It is an ambitious
 and risky strategy,</i>

08:29.209 --> 08:31.042
<i> and one which will
 cost the team</i>

08:31.044 --> 08:34.044
<i> in excess of $2 million.</i>

08:34.047 --> 08:36.615
That angle of incline
getting down

08:36.616 --> 08:39.217
into the Money Pit
I think has to be addressed.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.186
And do we have
a large enough area here

08:41.188 --> 08:43.221
for you to construct a crane?

08:43.222 --> 08:46.024
- Like I say, you level that off
a little bit. -

08:46.026 --> 08:47.526
Level that off there.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.294
How far back do you think?

08:49.296 --> 08:52.063
There's an old trail that comes
in up over the hill right there.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.832
-If we come up
that hill there... -Right.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.534
...that'd be just wonderful
for us. We could come up here...

08:55.536 --> 08:57.536
But we'd-we'd have to push
this bank out,

08:57.538 --> 09:00.205
-wouldn't we? -Well, take this
stuff off the top,

09:00.207 --> 09:03.041
the stuff that's no good, and
kind of push it to the corners.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.876
Well, we got to set up
a 100-ton over there,

09:04.878 --> 09:06.244
-and other stuff, too, so...
-Yeah.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.079
Okay, wait, I just--
hang on, then.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.048
100 tons sitting where?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.317
That could be a problem
for a 100-ton set up.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.287
<i> Because excavating
 the Money Pit</i>

09:15.289 --> 09:18.023
<i> will require the drill team
 to bring in massive</i>

09:18.025 --> 09:21.626
<i> 100- and 300-ton cranes,</i>

09:21.628 --> 09:25.230
<i> Rick Lagina is understandably
 concerned about the stability</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:27.799
<i> of the ground in the area.</i>

09:27.801 --> 09:30.602
<i> Two years ago,
 when trying to find</i>

09:30.604 --> 09:32.637
<i> the location
 of the original Money Pit,</i>

09:32.639 --> 09:36.875
<i> Rick, Craig and the team
 encountered serious problems</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:40.779
<i>after a drill rig began sinking
 into the marshy ground.</i>

09:42.082 --> 09:44.082
That ain't good.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.818
<i> What will further
 complicate their efforts</i>

09:46.820 --> 09:49.087
<i> is the fact that
 the Money Pit area</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:52.190
<i> has been dug up,
 filled in and re-dug</i>

09:52.192 --> 09:56.361
<i>for most of the last 220 years.</i>

09:58.599 --> 09:59.798
So there's a concern about
putting the 100-ton crane

09:59.800 --> 10:01.066
over here, then.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.001
- Absolutely.
- Yeah,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.270
if we set the 300-ton
right where we're standing

10:05.272 --> 10:07.839
and set the 100-ton
perpendicular to it,

10:07.841 --> 10:09.608
they can work that hole
simultaneously.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.109
You're gonna
need some surge rock,

10:11.111 --> 10:13.078
and maybe even like a...
a geogrid,

10:13.080 --> 10:14.779
you know, to support
the weight of the crane

10:14.781 --> 10:16.815
so it doesn't sink
into this stuff.

10:16.817 --> 10:20.151
<i> The enormity of
 the task facing Rick Lagina</i>

10:20.153 --> 10:22.621
<i> is beginning to sink in.</i>

10:22.623 --> 10:26.725
<i>The ground around the Money Pit
 will need to be leveled</i>

10:26.727 --> 10:30.295
<i> and then reinforced
 with layers of gravel.</i>

10:30.297 --> 10:33.331
<i> A new access road leading
 to and from the Money Pit</i>

10:33.333 --> 10:36.267
<i> will also need
 to be constructed.</i>

10:36.269 --> 10:39.838
The idea of bringing the road in
and coming in here,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.073
that's probably the best plan
right now is,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.409
this is all your-your heavy
lay down area.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.012
So, this whole area here
is gonna be a parking lot.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.217
I'd like to keep this
as less invasive as possible.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.853
The troubling aspect,
for me, is:

10:54.855 --> 10:57.122
<i> they need a large footprint.</i>

10:57.124 --> 10:59.824
<i> So, we want to make sure that
 we do things expeditiously,</i>

10:59.826 --> 11:02.694
but also respectfully.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.263
Look, we're not gonna
inhibit the process,

11:05.265 --> 11:06.998
but I would ask you to be good
stewards of the history,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.434
of the story, of the property.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.436
-We'll keep the footprint
as small as possible... -Yeah.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.071
...to do our work.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.773
If you stripped all
the topsoil off here,

11:14.775 --> 11:17.342
stockpiled it off to the side,
when they're done,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.177
just pull it back
and replant it.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.780
So it'll eventually
look like this again.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.784
<i> We don't want to repeat
 the Dunfield escapade</i>

11:25.786 --> 11:28.853
<i> and make a bombing area
 out of this. We don't.</i>

11:28.855 --> 11:31.456
<i> We want to be environmentally
 sensitive, but...</i>

11:31.458 --> 11:32.924
I'm ready to get into it.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.325
We're gonna dig there.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.194
I think we have
a general outline,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.430
a general understanding
of what we need to accomplish.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.398
- I think it's workable.
- Excellent.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
It sure is gonna
look different, I'll say that.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.408
<i>Okay, guys, today really
 is the extension of the trip</i>

11:50.410 --> 11:52.177
<i> we took earlier to New Ross.</i>

11:52.179 --> 11:54.279
<i> I mean, we're all excited
 about the well.</i>

11:54.281 --> 11:56.281
When you put the camera down,

11:56.283 --> 11:59.884
I didn't see much in terms of
the sides of the well,

11:59.886 --> 12:03.788
but the floor, to me,
looked very interesting.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.957
<i> While waiting for
 the team at Irving Equipment</i>

12:05.959 --> 12:09.961
<i>to begin prepping the Money Pit
 area for excavation,</i>

12:09.963 --> 12:13.465
<i> Rick Lagina, Charles Barkhouse</i>

12:13.467 --> 12:15.800
<i> and area researcher
 Doug Crowell</i>

12:15.802 --> 12:19.003
<i> are traveling, once again,
 to the town of New Ross,</i>

12:19.005 --> 12:23.007
<i> approximately 20 miles north
 of Oak Island.</i>

12:23.009 --> 12:26.244
I definitely saw what I thought
was a-a straight line,

12:26.246 --> 12:28.012
and it almost looked like
it was engraved,

12:28.014 --> 12:30.381
-you know what I mean?
-Yes.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.283
<i> Last week,</i>

12:32.285 --> 12:35.787
<i> based on information
 provided by Zena Halpern,</i>

12:35.789 --> 12:38.356
<i> Rick, Charles and Doug
 visited a site</i>

12:38.358 --> 12:40.759
<i> believed to contain the ruins</i>

12:40.761 --> 12:42.393
<i> of an ancient Templar Castle.</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:44.496
<i> At the site, they found</i>

12:44.498 --> 12:47.966
<i> what appeared to be
a weathered carving of a cross.</i>

12:47.968 --> 12:50.969
On the face of the stone,
you can see a very faint

12:50.971 --> 12:52.837
outline of a cross.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.306
No ordinary cross, but the cross
of the Knights Templar.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.878
<i> And when they put a camera</i>

12:59.880 --> 13:03.081
<i> down an ancient stone well
 on the property...</i>

13:03.083 --> 13:05.950
That look like flagstone floor?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.253
<i>...they found possible evidence</i>

13:08.255 --> 13:11.856
<i> that could link New Ross
 to the Oak Island mystery.</i>

13:11.858 --> 13:14.125
Now, didn't they find flagstone

13:14.127 --> 13:15.794
-at the Money Pit? -Yeah,
they did, at two feet down,

13:15.796 --> 13:17.162
they did find flagstones, yes.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.830
Maybe it's a ceiling

13:18.832 --> 13:20.498
and there's another chamber
beneath?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.436
<i> Might there be a false bottom?</i>

13:25.438 --> 13:28.873
Might there be a carving
in that flagstone, if you will.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.377
Very, very much looking forward
to Tony's... Tony's dive today.

13:33.547 --> 13:36.181
<i> Now, here they are,
 all set to go.</i>

13:36.183 --> 13:39.083
<i> To further
 investigate the well,</i>

13:39.085 --> 13:41.553
<i> Rick has enlisted the help
 of professional diver</i>

13:41.555 --> 13:44.522
<i> Tony Sampson
 and his support team.</i>

13:44.524 --> 13:47.058
If there's information
down there,

13:47.060 --> 13:50.295
this is the guy
and the crew to take care of it.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.031
Well, we're curious if the well
has something

13:53.033 --> 13:56.134
that's not visible--
just like the Money Pit

13:56.136 --> 13:59.304
had things underneath that were
not visible on the surface.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.440
If something is
indeed hidden here,

14:02.442 --> 14:05.944
the well could be one way
to-to reach it.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.912
Okay, in my perfect world,

14:07.914 --> 14:10.114
I would fall into the chamber
below it-- full of gold.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.549
- Okay?

14:11.551 --> 14:12.984
Why don't we head up there
and take a look.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.153
Yeah, let's get started.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.089
<i> Although proof
 of Knights Templar activity</i>

14:18.091 --> 14:21.593
<i> in North America
 has never been established,</i>

14:21.595 --> 14:26.397
<i>there are many who believe that
 not only was there activity,</i>

14:26.399 --> 14:28.199
<i> but that there is evidence</i>

14:28.201 --> 14:30.468
<i> that the Templars might have
 visited the New World</i>

14:30.470 --> 14:34.072
<i> as far back as
 the 12th century,</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:37.275
<i> more than 300 years
 before the journey</i>

14:37.277 --> 14:41.346
<i> of Christopher Columbus
 in 1492.</i>

14:41.348 --> 14:44.382
<i> In Scotland's Rosslyn Chapel--</i>

14:44.384 --> 14:47.552
<i>which was built by the grandson
 of suspected Templar Knight</i>

14:47.554 --> 14:50.889
<i> Henry Sinclair in 1486--</i>

14:50.891 --> 14:54.359
<i> the walls are illustrated
 with images of corn,</i>

14:54.361 --> 14:58.129
<i> along with representations
 of a plant known as trillium,</i>

14:58.131 --> 15:01.266
<i> both unique to North America.</i>

15:01.268 --> 15:04.903
<i> But even more curious
 are the testimonies</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:07.238
<i> of the First Nations people
 of Nova Scotia,</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:10.008
<i> the Mi'kmaq.</i>

15:10.010 --> 15:12.677
<i> Their legends tell stories
 of a mysterious stranger</i>

15:12.679 --> 15:15.580
<i> known as Glooscap,</i>

15:15.582 --> 15:19.951
<i> who many believe to be
 Henry Sinclair himself.</i>

15:19.953 --> 15:22.921
<i> But perhaps
 even more astounding</i>

15:22.923 --> 15:26.257
<i> is the eerie similarity
 between the Mi'kmaq flag</i>

15:26.259 --> 15:29.560
<i> and the battle flag of
 the Knights Templar.</i>

15:29.562 --> 15:33.031
<i> They are nearly one
 and the same.</i>

15:33.033 --> 15:36.968
- So, Tony, we'll probably have
to remove this lid. -

15:36.970 --> 15:41.205
And the water level looks a
little lower than it was before.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.640
Awesome.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.243
Can you see the cut marks
on the stones on the bottom?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.612
My impression was there was
a couple stones down there,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.248
and it almost looked like
a-a milled edge

15:50.250 --> 15:52.116
that sat really tightly
together,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.319
and maybe was indented
along the seam.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.688
That was my impression of
what was down there.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.290
So, it looked like
two fitted stones,

15:59.292 --> 16:02.961
with a crease quite a ways
down the middle of it.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.530
I mean, look,
there's not a lot of space

16:05.532 --> 16:08.533
down there, so...
how are you gonna

16:08.535 --> 16:11.502
orient yourself
to take a look-see?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.537
What we're gonna do, Rick,
is we're gonna

16:12.539 --> 16:14.272
set a frame up here...

16:14.274 --> 16:15.640
...and we're gonna have a beam
across the top,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.408
and we're gonna set up
a Bosun's chair.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.210
So, I've pretty much got my ass

16:19.212 --> 16:21.012
on the chair, going down.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.681
I'm gonna video 360,
going down the whole way.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.017
Okay, what say you?
Let's make this happen.

16:26.019 --> 16:26.985
Okay.

16:31.358 --> 16:35.226
<i> To safely descend
 down the stone well,</i>

16:35.228 --> 16:37.295
<i> Tony and his team
 are constructing what is known</i>

16:37.297 --> 16:39.297
<i> as a Bosun's chair.</i>

16:39.299 --> 16:42.367
<i> Attached to a pulley system,</i>

16:42.369 --> 16:45.169
<i> the chair is manually
 controlled to stop,</i>

16:45.171 --> 16:47.238
<i> raise and lower Tony,
 as needed.</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:51.309
<i> It will also enable him
 to rotate 360 degrees,</i>

16:51.311 --> 16:54.245
<i> allowing for
 a complete inspection</i>

16:54.247 --> 16:57.749
<i> of the well's interior.</i>

16:57.751 --> 16:59.751
So, Tony, what's-what's
the rig set up here?

16:59.753 --> 17:01.152
It-it kind of looks similar

17:01.154 --> 17:03.254
to what Dan went down in--
in 10-X.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.223
-Fill me in here. What's...

17:05.224 --> 17:07.724
Okay, so what we're gonna do is
I'm gonna go down there,

17:07.727 --> 17:10.661
- have a 360 around, just
doing a chair check... -

17:10.663 --> 17:12.730
...before I get the hard hat on
and suited up.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.766
Checking out to see if there's
any foreign objects,

17:14.768 --> 17:16.501
debris that might come down
on top of me.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.236
And then, once-once
I've checked her out,

17:18.238 --> 17:21.039
top of the water level, um...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.673
...then I'll, come back up
and get suited up.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.510
-Okay. Jump on.
-Fantastic. Okay.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.345
-Cool, buddy.
Let's give it a go. -Yeah.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.048
Okay, up.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.151
Okay. Lower down.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.553
- Down slow.
-That's good now, yeah.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.422
Down four.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.298
Slower four.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.613
What do you got there, Tony?
Loose one?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.315
Yeah, I've got a loose rock
here, mate.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.486
I want to take that out,
um, before we go any further.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.556
It's...if that comes down,
it's, it's bad news, man.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.296
Got it.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.765
That could make a good day
go bad really fast.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.633
Okay, I'll take
that hard hat back.

18:22.635 --> 18:26.104
-Here you go.
-Thanks, Mike.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.139
Take me down
probably another two feet, Mike.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.140
Roger.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.215
Okay, hold fast there.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.316
All stop.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.587
Well, that's kind of weird.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.358
What did you find down there,
Tony?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.194
These, right here
on these rocks here...

18:50.196 --> 18:51.762
Geez.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.897
Rick?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.632
-I've got, um...

18:54.634 --> 18:58.136
what could be a triangle.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.303
It's got a line
across the bottom,

18:59.305 --> 19:02.173
pointing straight up at you
from here.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.308
It's got some little pattern
in the middle.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.449
- You got that light, Nick?
- All right, here you go.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.317
This thing's amazing.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.255
<i> Some 20 miles
 from Oak Island,</i>

19:17.257 --> 19:21.759
<i> in the town of New Ross,
 diver Tony Sampson</i>

19:21.761 --> 19:23.594
<i> has just found
 a mysterious triangle</i>

19:23.596 --> 19:27.165
<i> carved inside
 an old stone well.</i>

19:27.167 --> 19:30.635
Let's get a picture. Let's get
a real clear photograph of it.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.538
<i> It is located on a property</i>

19:33.540 --> 19:35.840
<i>believed to have been inhabited
 by members</i>

19:35.842 --> 19:39.644
<i> of the Knights Templar,
 more than five centuries ago.</i>

19:39.646 --> 19:41.345
Whoa, beautiful.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.615
Okay, camera up, buddy.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.484
There's something there.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.486
You don't put a mark

19:48.488 --> 19:51.556
on a stone, you know,
halfway down a well.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.259
why in a well?

19:55.261 --> 19:57.728
-Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
-Right? -TIM: Right.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.896
Okay, Mike.

19:58.898 --> 19:59.830
Bring us up, buddy.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.966
Up slow.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.736
Wow.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.539
Rick, take a look at this.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.708
-Look at that.
-What?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.677
-No way.
-That's carved, without a doubt.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.313
Yeah, I would say so.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.416
That's...
doesn't look natural to me.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.751
There's no doubt in my mind
that that's etched in there.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.220
It certainly has the appearance

20:22.222 --> 20:23.521
of being cut into the stone.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.323
Yeah, it does.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.525
Well, what is that in there?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.594
Like a little dot?
-Yeah.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.861
It's like it's got an eye
in the middle.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.964
My God, yeah, I can see it.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.333
<i> A carved triangle?</i>

20:35.335 --> 20:36.867
<i> With an eye in the center?</i>

20:36.869 --> 20:38.803
<i> There are lots of
 triangular shapes</i>

20:38.805 --> 20:40.538
<i> associated with Oak Island.</i>

20:40.540 --> 20:44.308
The triangle shape meant
something to the Templars.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.877
<i> Is that a connection? Perhaps.</i>

20:46.879 --> 20:49.413
<i> The symbol of a triangle--</i>

20:49.415 --> 20:52.883
<i> or pyramid-- with an eye
 depicted in the center</i>

20:52.885 --> 20:55.620
<i> is known as
 "The Eye of Providence,"</i>

20:55.622 --> 20:58.489
<i> or the "all-seeing eye."</i>

20:58.491 --> 21:01.726
<i> It was adopted by
 the Freemasons</i>

21:01.728 --> 21:04.695
<i> in the late 18th century,</i>

21:04.697 --> 21:07.598
<i> although there are many
 who believe that it dates back</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:11.302
<i> much earlier to the days
 of the Knights Templar.</i>

21:11.304 --> 21:13.504
<i> In 1935,</i>

21:13.506 --> 21:16.374
<i> U.S. President
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt,</i>

21:16.376 --> 21:18.776
<i> a Freemason who had actually
 searched for treasure</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:21.579
<i> on Oak Island as a young man,</i>

21:21.581 --> 21:25.416
<i> instructed that the all-seeing
 eye be added to the design</i>

21:25.418 --> 21:27.652
<i> of the one-dollar bill.</i>

21:27.654 --> 21:31.389
<i> It is also the shape
 of a triangle that appears</i>

21:31.391 --> 21:34.358
<i> in the carvings on
 the mysterious 90 Foot Stone,</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:35.993
<i> and which can be</i>

21:35.995 --> 21:39.530
<i> seen in the dimensions
 of the Oak Island swamp,</i>

21:39.532 --> 21:42.066
<i> which many believe
 to have been man-made.</i>

21:44.070 --> 21:46.704
Okay, yep, she's good, buddy.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.372
So, next step,
you're gonna get geared up?

21:48.374 --> 21:49.440
-Yep.
-Perfect.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.715
Comms check,
one, two, three, four, five.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.485
Loud and clear
on this end, Tony.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.089
Roger that, buddy.
Let us know what you need.

22:05.091 --> 22:09.393
<i> Assisting Tony
 at the surface is safety diver</i>

22:09.395 --> 22:12.530
<i> and communications supervisor
 Mike Huntley.</i>

22:12.532 --> 22:15.466
<i> If Tony encounters
 any kind of danger,</i>

22:15.468 --> 22:17.802
<i>or needs assistance underwater,</i>

22:17.804 --> 22:20.671
<i> Mike will descend the well
 to help him.</i>

22:23.376 --> 22:25.543
You got to plant your ass
on that board.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.679
Okay. Roger that.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.550
Down slow.

22:38.891 --> 22:39.990
Roger, down to water.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.926
Down to the water!

22:46.499 --> 22:48.566
Yeah, roger, we have visual
on the camera here.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.838
Lower Tony down.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.845
Down two more feet!

23:04.016 --> 23:05.449
Diver's in the water.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.990
- All stop.
- All stop.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.665
Actually, visibility's great.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.906
Lower Tony down!

23:28.908 --> 23:31.475
Lowering down.

23:31.477 --> 23:33.811
<i> As I'm sitting there
 watching the monitor,</i>

23:33.813 --> 23:35.579
<i> you know,
 you're always hopeful.</i>

23:35.581 --> 23:37.481
<i> No matter where
 the search takes you,</i>

23:37.483 --> 23:39.884
you want so desperately to see

23:39.886 --> 23:42.019
something that answers
a question.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.888
<i> Just give us a clue.</i>

23:43.890 --> 23:46.123
<i> Just one clue.</i>

23:48.494 --> 23:50.461
Where is he
in relation to the bottom?

23:50.463 --> 23:51.996
Are his feet on the bottom?

23:51.998 --> 23:54.765
Are you touching bottom yet?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.600
Roger, on bottom.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.936
Is the bottom rough, smooth?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.472
Hey, Tony, can you feel
with your feet at all

24:01.474 --> 24:03.140
whether or not the bottom is
smooth or rough?

24:07.713 --> 24:08.913
Roger that.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.015
How deep?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.783
Can you tell how deep it is?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.887
Okay, roger. Two feet.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.193
Okay, roger.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.064
Visibility's not that great.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.234
It that the same down there?

24:34.574 --> 24:37.942
He lost visibility
because he's stirring it up.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.877
Clouded up just like 10X.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.645
We lost all visibility.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.782
<i> When the well got murky,</i>

24:44.784 --> 24:46.951
<i> it was more a sense
 of "not again."</i>

24:46.953 --> 24:49.186
Another dive where
we can't see anything.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.088
<i> Because I was absolutely
 convinced that</i>

24:51.090 --> 24:53.157
<i> it had been
 a fitted stone bottom.</i>

24:56.028 --> 24:57.728
Up five feet!

25:08.140 --> 25:09.240
All stop!

25:21.120 --> 25:23.287
<i> Diver Tony Sampson
 has just found</i>

25:23.289 --> 25:27.091
<i> another possible clue
 in an old stone well,</i>

25:27.093 --> 25:29.960
<i> which some researchers believe
 to have been built</i>

25:29.962 --> 25:32.096
<i> by members
 of the Knights Templar.</i>

25:34.700 --> 25:36.600
That's a Broad Arrow!

25:40.907 --> 25:43.140
I see something.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.644
Do you guys
not see that in there?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.613
Show... show me...
show me what you're seeing.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.917
Right there.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.218
But when he comes
at a different angle...

25:54.220 --> 25:55.753
Okay, okay, there I see it.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.721
-Yep. You see it now?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.257
I see it there.
Right here, here and there.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.126
You got her.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.194
<i> When it came to me,
 then I could see it.</i>

26:04.196 --> 26:06.330
The left side of the point,

26:06.332 --> 26:09.633
<i> if you will,
 saw that well-defined.</i>

26:09.635 --> 26:13.704
<i> Saw the-the stem, if you will,
 or the shaft of the arrow.</i>

26:13.706 --> 26:15.039
And you think that's
the King's Mark?

26:15.041 --> 26:16.240
-Yeah.
-What they call the King's Mark?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.608
Yeah, no mistake.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.078
<i> The Broad Arrow,</i>

26:21.080 --> 26:23.280
<i> also known as
 "The King's Mark,"</i>

26:23.282 --> 26:26.216
<i> was first used
 in the early 14th century</i>

26:26.218 --> 26:29.653
<i> by King Edward III of England.</i>

26:29.655 --> 26:31.989
<i> It was later adopted
 by the British government</i>

26:31.991 --> 26:34.792
<i> and used to mark
 government property.</i>

26:34.794 --> 26:37.895
<i> But why would
 a Broad Arrow carving appear</i>

26:37.897 --> 26:39.897
<i> at a site believed
 to have been established</i>

26:39.899 --> 26:42.366
<i> by members
 of the Knights Templar?</i>

26:46.238 --> 26:49.640
Roger that.
Up slow on turnbuckle.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.874
All the way up.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.978
Okay. All stop.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.779
If it's a King's Mark,
legitimately,

26:55.781 --> 26:59.083
<i> then I think where I would go
 at this point would be:</i>

26:59.085 --> 27:03.654
<i> is that symbol in any way
 associated with the Templars?</i>

27:03.656 --> 27:05.289
And that demands
further research.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.992
- Welcome to the surface.
-Thanks, guys.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.327
So you saw the feed on
from the camera up there?

27:10.329 --> 27:11.895
-Yeah.
-We did.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.097
But I need a firsthand
account here.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.298
What'd you see?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.333
She's definitely, um...

27:16.335 --> 27:17.935
That's not a flat bottom
down there.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.039
There is hard, large rocks
on the bottom.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.008
And I'm guessing...

27:24.010 --> 27:26.844
-Not flat though?
-No, no, not flat.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.312
But there is a lot of debris
down there.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.180
-Sure.
-Most interesting thing probably

27:30.182 --> 27:33.017
was, um, what appeared to be
that broad head arrow mark.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.119
But it's one of those
universal characters

27:35.121 --> 27:37.755
-that, you know, it stands for
the King's Mark. -Yeah, exactly.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.057
What else can it stand for?
A directional symbol?

27:40.059 --> 27:43.360
It may be an arrow that was
used for a different purpose.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.262
Exactly, yeah.
I mean that's...

27:45.264 --> 27:47.131
All that is, is my take on it.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.733
That's my part of history
that I-I know.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.368
But, I mean, symbolically,

27:51.370 --> 27:53.671
is that symbol used
by other people?

27:53.673 --> 27:56.140
I don't know.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.408
Well, it's a symbol
on the 90 Foot Stone.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.043
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.778
A triangle is
on the 90 Foot Stone,

28:00.780 --> 28:04.181
an arrow symbol
is on the 90 Foot Stone.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.417
<i> Is it possible
 that what appears to be</i>

28:06.419 --> 28:09.720
<i> a carving of a Broad Arrow,
 or the King's Mark,</i>

28:09.722 --> 28:12.156
<i> is something quite different?</i>

28:12.158 --> 28:14.725
<i> Could it be,
 as Doug Crowell insists,</i>

28:14.727 --> 28:17.027
<i> another important clue--</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:19.997
<i> one linking the carvings
 found at New Ross</i>

28:19.999 --> 28:22.433
<i> to the 90 Foot Stone
 found buried</i>

28:22.435 --> 28:25.269
<i> in the Oak Island Money Pit?</i>

28:25.271 --> 28:28.706
Tim, you've taken the first step
on a longer journey.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.941
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.243
Welcome to Oak Island.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.248
Okay, let's gear up
and go home.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.095
<i> One day after
 the team's productive</i>

28:51.097 --> 28:52.996
<i> investigation at New Ross,</i>

28:52.998 --> 28:56.133
<i> Rick, Marty and members
 of the Oak Island team</i>

28:56.135 --> 28:58.736
<i> meet with archaeologist
 Laird Niven.</i>

28:58.738 --> 29:00.871
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.173
<i> They've invited him
 to investigate the strange</i>

29:03.175 --> 29:07.911
<i> square-shaped hole found near
 Dave Blankenship's property.</i>

29:07.913 --> 29:09.513
Okay. Laird, we got
something we think

29:09.515 --> 29:12.082
-really peculiar.
-Excellent.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.085
A theorist named Zena sent us
an old French map

29:15.087 --> 29:18.355
that has a bunch of locations
that correspond to the island,

29:18.357 --> 29:20.424
-that are known.
-Okay.

29:20.426 --> 29:24.294
And one of them that's unknown
is a hatch.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.063
<i> The map is a very</i>

29:26.065 --> 29:28.365
rudimentary sketch,
if you will, of the island.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.168
You know, I mean, are we hoping
that it's a trap door?

29:31.170 --> 29:33.170
- Absolutely.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.239
But perhaps you have
an explanation of it.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.274
And, really, the only way to do
it is to set eyes on it, so...

29:37.276 --> 29:39.076
Yeah.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.477
Why don't...
why don't we take a look.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.213
<i> Could the so-called hatch</i>

29:43.215 --> 29:45.082
<i> really be evidence
 of an underground tunnel</i>

29:45.084 --> 29:46.984
<i> on Oak Island?</i>

29:46.986 --> 29:50.254
<i> Perhaps one that leads
 directly to the Money Pit?</i>

29:50.256 --> 29:52.890
<i> It'd be incredibly
 intriguing if he says,</i>

29:52.892 --> 29:55.025
<i> "You guys really are
 onto something here.</i>

29:55.027 --> 29:58.128
"It's a possibility
that it's a shaft, a tunnel,

29:58.130 --> 30:02.166
<i> a man-made opening to the area
 below Oak Island."</i>

30:02.168 --> 30:05.269
<i> I don't know what he's gonna
 say, but perhaps he can</i>

30:05.271 --> 30:06.336
give us some insight.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.380
Just a hole in the ground.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.083
It's odd.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.485
Has it collapsed in,
did you say?

30:21.487 --> 30:24.121
- Some.
- Here's the thing.

30:24.123 --> 30:27.558
This is all flat,
then sometime later,

30:27.560 --> 30:29.293
-all this earth goes somewhere.
-Yeah.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.094
That's what puzzles us.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.096
It's just not
a natural phenomena.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.298
-Yeah.
-I don't believe it.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.300
-Definitely.
-Not-not in slate.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.302
I definitely agree
with that, yeah.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.871
So, it could have been
a lot deeper.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.307
Maybe there was a wood hatch,
and then it rotted away,

30:43.309 --> 30:45.576
and that's what made it slump
all of a sudden.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.245
Jack, we can "what if"
till the cows come home.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.580
Exactly.

30:49.582 --> 30:51.281
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.851
-That's exactly what
I was gonna ask. -No. No.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.961
<i> that's strange.</i>

31:03.963 --> 31:07.631
Yes, it is strange.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.500
<i> On the western side
 of the island,</i>

31:10.502 --> 31:13.136
<i> Rick, Marty
 and members of the team</i>

31:13.138 --> 31:16.273
<i>have invited area archaeologist
 Laird Niven</i>

31:16.275 --> 31:18.909
<i> to help in their investigation
 of a strange,</i>

31:18.911 --> 31:21.111
<i> square-shaped hatch.</i>

31:21.113 --> 31:23.914
<i> If the hatch can be
 identified as man-made,</i>

31:23.916 --> 31:26.149
<i> and of ancient origin,</i>

31:26.151 --> 31:28.485
<i> then the brothers may have
 found another important clue</i>

31:28.487 --> 31:31.221
<i> to help them solve
 the Oak Island mystery.</i>

31:31.223 --> 31:34.358
It does seem like
rocks have been removed.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.226
That's been cut.

31:36.228 --> 31:41.231
That's not natural, and this...
this is pretty loose fill.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.902
It keeps going
for a bit, you can see.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.070
You... so, you think
it goes off to the side?

31:47.072 --> 31:48.405
At least for a little bit.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.340
<i> The thing we obviously</i>

31:50.342 --> 31:53.210
want it to be
is the entrance to a tunnel.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.579
<i> And there were
 some evidence of that.</i>

31:55.581 --> 31:58.015
<i> He thought three of the sides
 were solid,</i>

31:58.017 --> 32:00.384
but on... at least on one side,
he thought it might

32:00.386 --> 32:02.219
go off, somewhat.

32:02.221 --> 32:06.089
It warrants
further investigation.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.291
So, where should we go?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.259
Who should we notify?
How do we do this?

32:09.261 --> 32:12.229
Well, if I was to investigate it
as an archaeologist,

32:12.231 --> 32:14.431
I'd get a permit,
probably remove

32:14.433 --> 32:16.366
-some of these small trees.
-Right.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.468
Is there any prohibition
against if you're just digging

32:18.470 --> 32:21.071
it out with a hand shovel?
I mean, we just don't want

32:21.073 --> 32:23.340
-to get afoul with the rules,
you know. -Right.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.342
-I couldn't do it
without a permit. -Right.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.177
I think this is
a disclosure deal, then.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.146
We just tell whoever
in the government.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.447
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.982
<i> We're gonna go ahead</i>

32:31.984 --> 32:33.183
and disclose it
to the authorities,

32:33.185 --> 32:35.052
so we have
some permitting issues

32:35.054 --> 32:37.120
to work our way through
before we dig over there.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.555
<i> Rick and Marty's decision</i>

32:38.557 --> 32:41.024
<i> to involve
 the Canadian government</i>

32:41.026 --> 32:43.026
<i> will cost them time,</i>

32:43.028 --> 32:46.229
<i> but will be beneficial to
 the process in the long run.</i>

32:46.231 --> 32:48.398
<i> There are many who believe</i>

32:48.400 --> 32:51.435
<i> that Oak Island
 is a national treasure,</i>

32:51.437 --> 32:54.705
<i> and quite possibly
 a sacred archaeological site.</i>

32:54.707 --> 32:58.408
<i> Although two centuries
 of treasure hunting</i>

32:58.410 --> 33:03.313
<i> have seen the island dug up,
 bulldozed and even detonated,</i>

33:03.315 --> 33:06.583
<i> the Laginas and their partners
 have been determined</i>

33:06.585 --> 33:11.455
<i> to take a more responsible
 and scientific approach.</i>

33:11.457 --> 33:13.757
All right, I think we've done
what we need to do here.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.126
Well, we have a... you know,

33:16.128 --> 33:18.295
-a logical way to pursue it.
-Right.

33:18.297 --> 33:21.064
-Thank you very much.
-All right, no problem at all.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.745
<i> We got
 the three engineers here.</i>

33:34.747 --> 33:38.448
So, there are some logistical
issues, I think, with...

33:38.450 --> 33:41.385
you know, boring down
into the Money Pit.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.021
-You know, we have the targets,
right? -Yeah.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.490
<i> In the War Room,
 Marty Lagina, his partner</i>

33:46.492 --> 33:50.427
<i> Craig Tester and Marty's son
 Alex have gathered</i>

33:50.429 --> 33:53.497
<i> to discuss the next phase
 in their exploration of</i>

33:53.499 --> 33:55.165
<i> the Oak Island Money Pit.</i>

33:55.167 --> 33:57.034
So,

33:57.036 --> 33:58.802
once we get close
to the target zones, I mean,

33:58.804 --> 34:00.771
they're gonna be bringing up
a lot of material

34:00.773 --> 34:02.639
that we're gonna
have to get a...

34:02.641 --> 34:04.741
at least a real quick
look at... right away.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.243
Yeah, I could calculate that.
Have you calculated

34:06.245 --> 34:08.478
-how many yards per foot?
-I have not.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.347
Let's do that.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.114
<i> We've got the resources,</i>

34:12.117 --> 34:14.650
we've got the ability,
and we have the drive.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.120
<i> We really hope
 this is the year.</i>

34:17.121 --> 34:19.755
<i> We want to get
 to the bottom of this.</i>

34:19.757 --> 34:21.757
So...

34:21.760 --> 34:24.460
if you're interested from say...

34:24.463 --> 34:27.563
115 to 135?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.533
-Hey, Rick. 'Sup?
-Hey, guys. -RICK: Hey.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.333
We're just going over,
casing logistics.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.070
So it's about...

34:33.072 --> 34:35.806
yeah, about a yard
every three feet.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.507
So, 30 feet would be ten yards.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.545
It's not that bad.
I mean, it's a lot of material.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.480
It's not if you're looking
at... for a chest.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.614
Yeah, that's the key.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.251
Now, a different sized casing
down hole will have

34:48.253 --> 34:49.585
a bit of a gap between,

34:49.588 --> 34:52.355
but that's where I'm starting
to get concerned

34:52.357 --> 34:54.324
is that we're just
gonna get too close.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.460
What's up with you guys?

34:56.462 --> 34:59.596
It's...it's sad news.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.866
You know...

35:02.868 --> 35:07.504
I just got an e-mail
from Tom Nolan and...

35:07.506 --> 35:10.107
Fred Nolan has passed away.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.598
<i> The sudden news
 that 89-year-old landowner</i>

35:34.600 --> 35:37.501
<i> and fellow treasure hunter
 Fred Nolan</i>

35:37.503 --> 35:42.639
<i> has died sends shock waves
 through the Oak Island team,</i>

35:42.641 --> 35:45.609
<i>especially in light of the fact
 that they had hoped</i>

35:45.611 --> 35:49.212
<i> to work more closely
 with him this year.</i>

35:49.214 --> 35:53.216
- How do you feel
about that? - I'm sad.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.852
You know, I'm deeply
affected by it, by the news.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.387
I...

35:57.389 --> 35:59.523
You know, we came here--
all of us--

35:59.525 --> 36:03.360
came here with this sense of
putting a stamp to the story.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.163
Then, I think,
you and I specifically,

36:06.165 --> 36:07.564
we came here with the quest.

36:07.566 --> 36:10.267
Part of the quest,
if you will, was

36:10.269 --> 36:14.404
to give the aging lions--
your father and Fred--

36:14.406 --> 36:18.175
a sense of completion, a sense
of: here's the proof for,

36:18.177 --> 36:21.478
between them,
110 years of search,

36:21.480 --> 36:24.514
legitimate, hard-won,
hard-fought search.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.751
<i> A land surveyor by trade,</i>

36:27.753 --> 36:30.220
<i> Fred Nolan spent
 more than six decades</i>

36:30.222 --> 36:32.389
<i> looking for treasure
 on Oak Island.</i>

36:32.391 --> 36:35.258
<i> It was Fred
 who first discovered</i>

36:35.260 --> 36:37.360
<i> the mysterious
 collection of boulders</i>

36:37.362 --> 36:39.629
<i> known as Nolan's Cross.</i>

36:39.631 --> 36:42.265
<i> He did extensive explorations</i>

36:42.267 --> 36:45.502
<i> of the island's
 strange triangle-shaped swamp.</i>

36:45.504 --> 36:48.471
<i> And he also measured
 and analyzed</i>

36:48.473 --> 36:50.273
<i> numerous carvings,</i>

36:50.275 --> 36:52.275
<i> artifacts and other anomalies</i>

36:52.277 --> 36:54.611
<i> that he collected
 over the years.</i>

36:54.613 --> 36:56.580
- I've been at it for
so long now... -

36:56.582 --> 36:59.482
...that if I didn't relate
this kind of stuff,

36:59.484 --> 37:01.518
- who'd put it together again?
- Exactly.

37:04.489 --> 37:07.958
You know, I'm not sure how
your father is gonna take it.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.262
Speaking of which, does he know?

37:12.264 --> 37:14.464
Not yet.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.367
I think we should go tell Dan.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.668
I'd like to.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.372
Let's do that, guys.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.950
<i> Hey, Daniel.</i>

37:33.952 --> 37:35.619
<i> Hey, Marty!</i>

37:35.621 --> 37:38.788
<i> How are you, partner?
 -Good.</i>

37:38.790 --> 37:41.358
So, Dan...

37:41.360 --> 37:44.294
I have some, um...

37:44.296 --> 37:46.596
some... what I consider to be
sad news.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.899
Fred Nolan has passed away.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.446
<i> For most of their time</i>

38:03.448 --> 38:07.851
<i> on Oak Island, Dan Blankenship
 and Fred Nolan were engaged</i>

38:07.853 --> 38:10.353
<i> -in an intense rivalry.
- Sit down.</i>

38:10.355 --> 38:13.290
<i> One which only seemed
 to grow even more bitter</i>

38:13.292 --> 38:15.959
<i> with the passage of time.</i>

38:15.961 --> 38:18.328
<i> I mean, it was like
 the Hatfields and McCoys</i>

38:18.330 --> 38:19.896
<i> out here, so now, regretfully,</i>

38:19.898 --> 38:21.965
<i> Fred's passed on,
 and it will bring change.</i>

38:21.967 --> 38:23.767
<i> I mean, this has always been</i>

38:23.769 --> 38:26.469
the Fred Nolan
and Dan Blankenship story

38:26.471 --> 38:28.772
for 60 odd years
and now it won't be anymore.

38:28.774 --> 38:32.075
Do you remember
when you first met Fred?

38:32.077 --> 38:33.677
Yeah.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.645
I came up here in '65.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.915
Fred had been
on the island several years

38:38.917 --> 38:40.750
earlier than I was.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.086
I had quite a few
conversations with him

38:43.088 --> 38:44.721
over the period of time.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.022
He's like...

38:46.024 --> 38:48.358
I guess like all
treasure hunters, I mean,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.894
a little bit on
the secretive side, you know.

38:52.631 --> 38:56.366
<i> You know,
 I don't know how Dan</i>

38:56.368 --> 38:58.368
<i> really sees Fred's passing.</i>

38:58.370 --> 39:01.771
<i>But, look, they both persevered</i>

39:01.773 --> 39:05.975
<i> in the face
 of all kinds of adversity.</i>

39:05.977 --> 39:11.014
<i> They risked, they sweated,
 they worked, they labored</i>

39:11.016 --> 39:12.549
towards the common goal.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.752
You don't get any closer
than that.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.388
<i> So, to that end, I guess,</i>

39:18.390 --> 39:19.689
<i> they were closer
 than they thought.</i>

39:19.691 --> 39:21.358
You know, whenever Rick

39:21.360 --> 39:23.827
would talk about this place,
it was always about, well,

39:23.829 --> 39:26.429
Blankenship's doing this
and Nolan's doing that.

39:26.431 --> 39:29.065
But we always thought,
or it was our hope,

39:29.067 --> 39:30.934
- that we could work together.
- Yeah.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.769
- It was my belief that we could.
- Well, we did.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.371
We did work together.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.439
Sounds like, to me,

39:36.441 --> 39:38.575
that you see it,
and I think we all do really,

39:38.577 --> 39:40.910
we see Oak Island
as a big giant puzzle.

39:40.912 --> 39:44.080
I know that Fred told me once
that that's how he saw it,

39:44.082 --> 39:45.949
-a big giant puzzle.
-That's why they call it

39:45.951 --> 39:47.951
- the Oak Island mystery.
-Exactly.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.120
So, you know, we got to get busy

39:50.122 --> 39:53.056
and start putting pieces
into the right places.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.724
- Amen.
- Amen.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.025
- All right.
- Okay, Dan.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.761
Okay, off we go.
We'll get back to work.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.730
Yeah. Hey, remember,
you're not going anywhere.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.599
Okay.

40:02.601 --> 40:03.833
See you, Daniel.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.735
-See you later, Dad.
-Okay, Dave.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.411
Well, all I can say is,
you know,

40:14.413 --> 40:16.646
it's a partial passing
of the old guard,

40:16.648 --> 40:19.082
and I'm gonna miss him.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.550
Okay,
but we got to move forward.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.553
<i>We got to move forward.
 Siempre avante.</i>

40:23.555 --> 40:26.423
<i> My mom would always say
"siempre avante"--</i>

40:26.425 --> 40:29.025
always forward, keep going.

40:29.027 --> 40:32.962
How many years' work
is this map represent?

40:32.964 --> 40:35.765
40, 50 years.
-Wow.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.501
<i> Fred's passing
 affected me in two ways.</i>

40:38.503 --> 40:41.004
<i> One, it was the fact
 that he is now gone</i>

40:41.006 --> 40:43.606
<i> and I'll never
 shake his hand again.</i>

40:43.608 --> 40:49.612
I'll never know
what he knew, and...

40:49.614 --> 40:55.185
it's impactful with Dan because
now there's but one remaining.

40:55.187 --> 41:00.590
<i> And I want to refocus
 and re-energize and recommit.</i>

41:00.592 --> 41:04.861
<i> Because out of respect
 for both of them,</i>

41:04.863 --> 41:07.664
<i> I want answers.</i>

41:07.666 --> 41:10.133
<i> For Rick, Marty
 and their partners,</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:12.235
<i> Fred's passing is a reminder</i>

41:12.237 --> 41:15.738
<i> that life is short,</i>

41:15.740 --> 41:19.175
<i> progress must continue,</i>

41:19.177 --> 41:23.046
<i> and that the time to solve
 the Oak Island mystery</i>

41:23.048 --> 41:25.014
<i> is now.</i>

41:32.958 --> 41:35.758
<i> Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:35.760 --> 41:39.095
<i> It's the actual start
 of this Money Pit dig.</i>

41:39.097 --> 41:41.064
The story of Oak Island
revolves around this spot.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.799
<i> You're a part of history now.</i>

41:42.801 --> 41:45.201
So, these are the interesting
targets in the swamp.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.604
Let's get out there
and get some answers.

41:47.606 --> 41:50.874
<i> The easiest thing is
 to put a diver back in there.</i>

41:50.876 --> 41:53.109
- I've got something!
- What is that?

41:53.111 --> 41:56.079
- Wow, it's huge.
- What is this?

41:56.081 --> 41:57.881
- What does that look like?
- It looks like an X,

41:57.883 --> 41:59.082
with a hook.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.217
<i> Is that symbol the Templars?</i>
