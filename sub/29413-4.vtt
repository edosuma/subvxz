WEBVTT

00:14.144 --> 00:16.146
Dad, can we go back inside?

00:16.190 --> 00:17.669
It's hot out here.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.671
Aw, come on, buddy,
it's not that bad.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.934
It's just a little
fall heat wave.

00:21.978 --> 00:26.678
Besides, it's cooled down
to a comfy... 102.

00:26.722 --> 00:30.117
Then can I at least have a turn?

00:30.160 --> 00:32.336
What are you talking about?

00:32.380 --> 00:34.338
I let you open the box.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.302
Hey, Calvin.

00:41.345 --> 00:44.783
Hey, Dave.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.743
Why are you sitting
in your truck?

00:47.786 --> 00:52.052
Just trying to soak in some AC
for my run into the house.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.838
Okay. All right.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.710
Here I go.

01:03.585 --> 01:04.803
Calvin, wait.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.415
What?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.112
Damn it, you just made me
breathe out

01:09.156 --> 01:10.940
all my air conditioning.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.724
Hey, before you go inside,

01:12.768 --> 01:15.858
check out this sick loop
into a barrel roll.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.860
Now, first you lean
on the throttle,

01:17.903 --> 01:19.209
and then you pull back on the...

01:19.253 --> 01:20.819
Whoa, whoa, watch out
for the power line.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.865
Oh...

01:26.912 --> 01:29.828
Guess now I get to put it
back in the box.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.745
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:33.789 --> 01:35.095
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:40.230 --> 01:44.060
Dave knocks out our power,
but his power stays on.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.542
If that's not white privilege,
I don't know what to tell you.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.806
Hey, you know, Pop,

01:50.849 --> 01:53.200
it could take the city
a couple of days to fix it.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.115
You sure you don't want
to go with me to Marty's?

01:55.158 --> 01:57.117
No, this is Dave's fault.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.295
I'm staying at his place, eating
his food, and cranking his air.

02:01.338 --> 02:04.950
I'm thinking somewhere
between meat locker and igloo.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.738
Lord, it's like an oven in here.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.567
My nooks are starting
to stick to my crannies.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.136
If this is what hell feels like,

02:16.179 --> 02:18.225
I'm-a start going to church
more often.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.096
Even during football season?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.315
It's not that hot.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.104
I feel so bad
that Calvin and Tina

02:28.148 --> 02:29.758
have to spend
the night here.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
It was an accident.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.240
It wasan accident, right?

02:34.589 --> 02:36.112
Of course it was an accident.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.203
I told you. Grover took it
out of the box wrong.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.253
Let us in! It's hot out here!

02:46.296 --> 02:49.560
TINA:
Yeah, I'm starting to sweat
my eyebrows off!

02:49.604 --> 02:51.736
Oh, hey, guys, come on in...Out of the way.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.999
I'm looking for a vent.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.263
Oh, yeah, there it is. Okay.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.352
Get all over me. Yeah.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.137
Get in where you fit in,
right there.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.923
Yeah, uh, thanks again
for letting us stay here.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.882
Are you kidding?
We're so glad to have you.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.058
Oh, no! You don't want
any part of this.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.625
I'm funky as hell.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.236
And, guys, while you're here,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.238
please consider
our home your home.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.501
Well, in that case, you're
Malcolm. Go get me a beer.

03:19.242 --> 03:22.419
Perfect. One pumpkin
spice lager coming up.

03:22.463 --> 03:26.380
Thanks, and, uh,
don't forget the beer.

03:26.423 --> 03:29.209
Okay, we've got you
all set up in our bedroom.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.994
Fresh towels, clean sheets,
and a bunch of little bottles

03:32.037 --> 03:34.257
of shampoo I stole
from a hotel.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.042
Ooh. Gemma, you didn't
have to do that.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.609
I know, but it was
such a rush.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.222
Okay, since you weren't
into the pumpkin spice,

03:42.265 --> 03:45.834
I got you something
a little more traditional.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.402
Is any part of
the name a fruit?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.710
I'm gonna run to the store.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.495
No, no, no, don't-- Dave.
Don't bother.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.888
We'll just go freshen up
and then come down for dinner.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.282
Oh, cool. Well, then, maybe
after that we can watch a movie,

03:59.326 --> 04:01.850
play a game, or, I don't know,
just kick it.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.200
Good night, everybody.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.289
Good night. Oh...

04:13.340 --> 04:15.472
Hey. What's up, man?: Hey.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.995
Come on in, brother.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.259
Oh, wow, Marty,
your place looks great.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.738
I see you redecorated.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.958
Yeah. I like to call
my new aesthetic

04:23.001 --> 04:25.569
"Mid-Century Marty.":
Oh.

04:25.613 --> 04:30.182
Well, that's a nice change of
pace from "Last Century Calvin."

04:30.226 --> 04:31.749
It's good to have you, man.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.186
Take a load off,
make yourself comfortable.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.232
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.755
Ah.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.191
Maybe not that comfortable.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.715
Oh.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.326
Okay. My bad.No, you know, it's just--

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
this is a coffee table,
not an ottoman.Right.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.416
Totally different
pieces of furniture.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.593
Okay, I get it, man. Thank you.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.508
What is this?Wh-Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:51.552 --> 04:54.032
Whoa, whoa!What, man, what?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.338
What do you think you're doing?

04:55.382 --> 04:57.514
Marty, I'm just checking out
your new toys.

04:57.558 --> 05:02.084
Toys? M-Malcolm, these are
scale models of the Saturn V,

05:02.127 --> 05:05.522
the Atlantisshuttle,
and the Apollo 11Lunar Module.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
Okay? These are some
of the most important examples

05:07.394 --> 05:10.919
of mankind's ascent into space.Right.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.487
Now, is that where they met
the Green Power Ranger?

05:14.749 --> 05:17.273
No, man.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.362
He's there to protect them.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.496
Hey, Marty, look, this
is all just stuff, bro.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.324
Don't be such a nerd.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.196
Oh, man, you know,
I'm not a nerd.

05:27.239 --> 05:30.895
You know, I'm not a nerd. Just,
uh, I like things a certain way.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.202
Yeah, I know you do. You used
to eat your alphabet soup

05:33.245 --> 05:35.378
in alphabetical order.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.249
Uh, hello?
That's called a system.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.383
And it's that kind
of attention to detail

05:40.427 --> 05:42.646
that makes JPL
hire a person like me.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.996
Yeah, well, I work at JPL, too.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.304
Well, you know...

05:48.348 --> 05:50.698
You know... No disrespect,
but-but you're a security guard.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.439
I-I'm an engineer.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.964
That's all disrespect.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.488
No, I-I'm just saying, man, like
i-if you press the wrong button,

05:58.532 --> 06:00.316
somebody gets off
on the wrong floor.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.580
If I press the wrong button,
goodbye, Moon.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.321
Wait a minute,
you can blow up the moon?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.844
You heard nothing.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.196
Listen, Malcolm, this is,
this is my place, you know?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.981
So-so, while you're here,

06:13.024 --> 06:15.418
why don't we just keep things
the way that I like them?

06:15.462 --> 06:16.985
All right, man, fine.All right.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.290
I'm-a go take a shower.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.815
Unless you're uncomfortable
with that, too.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.120
Don't be silly.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.035
All right.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.559
Just don't take your cell phone
in there.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.604
I don't like the radiation
near my Q-tips.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.917
Oh, hey, Gem. I was
just coming down

06:35.960 --> 06:38.180
to get a glass of wine!

06:40.835 --> 06:42.271
Oh, my God.

06:42.314 --> 06:46.144
It's okay. It's just
a hydrating sheet mask.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.494
Well, are you sure?
Because it looks like

06:47.537 --> 06:49.800
you're wearing
your victim's face.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.455
Oh, like, Hannibal Lecter?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.805
"I enjoyed his liver

06:54.849 --> 06:57.417
with some fava beans
and a nice Chia..."

07:00.115 --> 07:02.073
: I think I just
swallowed some of my mask.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.335
Oh...

07:04.859 --> 07:07.470
So, do you do
one of those every night?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.341
Oh, no. Just once a week.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.343
What do you do for your skin?

07:11.387 --> 07:12.910
Well, I have
this complex regimen

07:12.954 --> 07:14.695
that I do seven nights a week.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.219
Ooh, what is it?

07:17.262 --> 07:18.438
It's called being black.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.447
Damn. Gemma wasn't joking.

07:27.490 --> 07:30.841
She jacked, like,
50 hotels' worth of shampoo.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.017
You know,

07:33.061 --> 07:35.411
I'm keeping my eye on her the
next time she uses our bathroom.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.807
Well, I know I ain't getting
a good night's sleep tonight.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.810
These sheets are grabbing me
like Velcro.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.421
They feel good to me.
They feel smooth.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.860
Not smooth enough. You know
how I like to slip around.

07:54.299 --> 07:58.652
Stop complaining
and just, just put on the TV.

07:58.695 --> 08:02.656
Fine. But I'm buying a movie
whether we watch it or not.

08:02.699 --> 08:05.006
Where's the remote?

08:05.049 --> 08:07.312
I don't know.
Check Dave's nightstand.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.967
Oh... Yeah.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.840
Ain't nothing in here but
a bunch of self-help books.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.625
Building Connections
with Kindness.

08:15.669 --> 08:19.586
Even his books are annoying.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.501
Calvin, stop snooping around.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.503
White people got cameras.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.422
Look at this, Tina.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.946
Dave has a Bible, too.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.078
You know what? Maybe
we should invite him

08:34.122 --> 08:35.602
to our church sometime.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.128
Could you imagine
Dave at a black church?

08:40.171 --> 08:42.130
What?
That tambourine
would never recover.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.613
Oh, hold on, this ain't a Bible.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.920
Oh, no, baby,
that must be Dave's journal.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.574
Put that back. That's not right.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.576
Oh, no, it's okay, Tina.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.666
He already tells me
everything anyway. You know?

08:56.710 --> 09:01.541
Oh, ooh, this is good, too,
right here. Check this out.

09:01.584 --> 09:05.414
"Old Miss Kim made me
uncomfortable again today.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.373
Why would she want
to drink my bathwater?"

09:10.724 --> 09:16.468
Hey, Dave, if you're watching,
I'm not in this.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.036
: Oh.
Here's another one right here.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.561
"Came up with
my own cool handshake.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.041
Gonna try it out
on Malcolm tomorrow."

09:24.085 --> 09:25.652
Look, he even drew pictures
and everything.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.523
Look at this...

09:27.567 --> 09:29.830
Calvin, Calvin, look,
that's enough.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.659
Okay? Enough with the journal. Just one more, okay?

09:32.702 --> 09:34.574
Oh, my God.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.227
Wait, wait a minute.
What the hell?

09:36.271 --> 09:38.447
What?

09:38.490 --> 09:39.927
L-Let me see
your reading glasses.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.234
Oh, uh, here. Here, here.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.020
Mmm.

09:46.063 --> 09:50.546
"Calvin Butler thinks
he's such a big shot,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.679
"but the truth is
he's a ridiculous,

09:52.722 --> 09:55.116
insecure little man."

09:57.292 --> 09:59.555
Damn, Dave, that's cold.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.434
Who the hell does
Dave think he is,

10:09.478 --> 10:11.872
calling me insecure
and ridiculous?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.656
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
This handshake.
That's ridiculous.

10:15.789 --> 10:19.183
It's got a pinkie swear in it.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.663
Calvin, stop reading that.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.273
It's just hurting
your feelings, baby.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.753
Feelings?
Yeah.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.103
Tina, I'm a man.
I don't have feelings.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.455
Besides, I don't give a damn
what Dave thinks of me.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.807
Okay. Well, in that case,
let's go to sleep.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.852
Yeah, let's go to sleep.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.201
Okay.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.031
CALVIN:
I can't sleep!

10:42.511 --> 10:44.426
I need to get this off
my chest right now.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.169
Damn these Velcro sheets.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.476
Calvin, Calvin, stop.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.262
You cannot talk to Dave.Why not?

10:54.305 --> 10:55.959
Because he'll know
that you read his journal,

10:56.003 --> 10:59.615
and no matter what he wrote,
baby, that was wrong.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.269
I don't care.

11:01.312 --> 11:05.012
Well, do you care that it's 105
degrees in our house right now?

11:06.448 --> 11:08.102
Sleep well, Tina.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.149
Good morning, Malcolm.

11:15.457 --> 11:18.982
Good morning, Martin.
Are you ready to go to work?

11:19.026 --> 11:20.941
What-what happened?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.988
Well, I don't know.
I'm just a security guard.

11:26.468 --> 11:30.341
You probably need a fancy
engineer to figure this out.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.953
Okay. This isn't funny.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.781
Oh, I strongly disagree.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.608
All right.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.872
All right, you made your point.
Now help me put everything back.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.744
This chair goes here. Okay?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.833
These stools go
right over here and...

11:43.877 --> 11:46.923
Ooh!

11:48.403 --> 11:51.972
Why is Spock holding hands
with Optimus Prime?

11:52.015 --> 11:53.930
Wait a minute.
Don't judge, Marty.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.758
Love is love, brother.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.674
"Love is love." No.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.936
Spock can't love.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.895
He doesn't have emotions!

12:07.117 --> 12:09.641
Are we having chocolate chip
pancakes for breakfast?

12:09.685 --> 12:12.514
Yeah. We wanted to do something
special for the Butlers.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.777
I'm so glad
we broke their house.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.738
Good morning.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.478
Oh, hey, how'd you guys sleep?

12:20.522 --> 12:23.307
Like he cares.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.570
I hope you're hungry.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.268
We made chocolate chip pancakes.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.009
Yeah, I remembered
they're your favorite.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.099
You don't know me, Dave.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.319
Are you still mad
about the drone?

12:35.363 --> 12:38.540
Oh, no. No, that was
a blessing in disguise.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.761
I totally agree.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.894
Okay, then, uh,
what's bothering you?

12:44.938 --> 12:46.896
I'll tell you
what's bothering me...Calvin.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.158
No, Tina.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.682
Look, I am too upset.
I got to speak my mind.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.859
It's all the shampoo I stole,
isn't it?

12:52.902 --> 12:55.209
I have a problem.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.299
What-what-- no, no, no, no.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.562
Actually, this is between
Calvin and Dave.

13:00.605 --> 13:03.565
So why don't we go into the
living room and watch cartoons?

13:04.653 --> 13:07.612
And we'll talk about getting you
into a program.

13:09.223 --> 13:12.226
Okay, Calvin, what's going on?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.228
I'll tell you what's going on.

13:14.271 --> 13:18.014
You called me a ridiculous,
insecure little man.

13:18.058 --> 13:21.061
When did I say that?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.019
August 3.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.894
Right after Old Miss Kim
tried to get busy with you.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.853
What are you...?

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
Calvin, did you read my journal?

13:37.164 --> 13:39.122
Maybe.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.822
That is a total violation
of my privacy.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.040
How could you do that?

13:44.084 --> 13:45.912
Look, if you didn't want
anybody to read it,

13:45.955 --> 13:47.174
you shouldn't have
left it buried

13:47.217 --> 13:49.524
in the back of your nightstand.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.047
I can't believe you did this.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.223
I-I thought we were friends.And so did I,

13:53.267 --> 13:56.444
until I went behind your back
and read your journal.

13:56.487 --> 14:00.274
You know, based on the way
that you are acting,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.754
I was right on about August 3.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.714
And September 15.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.283
What'd you say then?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.154
You'll never know.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.808
You know what? Forget this.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.027
I'm out of here.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.899
A-And for your information,

14:16.943 --> 14:21.034
Old Miss Kim beentrying
to drink my bathwater.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.603
You ain't special, Dave.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.261
Hey, I was told
I need to escort

14:31.305 --> 14:33.089
a terminated employee
out of the building?

14:33.133 --> 14:35.004
He's right in here
packing up.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.397
All right.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.182
Oh, wait. Uh...

14:39.226 --> 14:41.184
Marty, you're not the one
who's fired, are you?

14:41.228 --> 14:43.099
Yeah. I transposed
some coordinates,

14:43.143 --> 14:45.145
and now our GPS satellite
is sending everybody

14:45.188 --> 14:47.234
to a Starbucks in Wyoming.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.193
Wh-- how'd you do that?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.674
I'll tell you how.
You messed up my stuff.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.198
I was too stressed to focus
and now I'm fired.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.766
Oh, wait.
Hey, look-look, uh, uh, Bill,

14:57.809 --> 14:59.289
this is all my fault, all right?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.595
Just tell me
what the damages are

15:00.638 --> 15:02.075
and you can take it
out of my paycheck.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.207
He lost a multimillion-dollar
satellite.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.209
Okay, I'm-a need
to work some overtime.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.257
It's too late, Malcolm.
There's nothing you can do.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.303
Hey, look. Come on, man.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.566
You cannot fire Marty,
all right?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.046
You should see his apartment.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.309
It is practically
a shrine to all this...

15:19.353 --> 15:22.138
nerd stuff that y'all do here.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.488
Uh, sorry, but it's
out of my hands.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.534
Yeah, but this job
is his life, man.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.536
He can't lose it because of me.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.972
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

15:30.016 --> 15:31.278
before you pulled
your stupid prank.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.975
Look, I know.
Y-You're right, Marty.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.717
I just, I thought
it would be funny.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.110
But it wasn't, was it?

15:37.153 --> 15:40.287
No.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.942
You want you know what is?What?

15:42.985 --> 15:45.118
The fact that I'm pranking you
right now!

15:45.161 --> 15:47.685
Yeah.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.906
Yeah!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.908
Wait, wait, wait, wait, so...

15:52.952 --> 15:54.562
all of you were in on this?

15:54.605 --> 15:57.521
That's right.
I've never felt so cool.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.481
You should've seen
your face.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.963
"But this job is his life.
He can't lose it 'cause of me."

16:06.008 --> 16:07.967
Okay, well,
what can I say, Marty?

16:08.010 --> 16:10.621
You got me good.Oh, I did, didn't I?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.101
It was pretty funny, right?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.669
That was really funny.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.714
Can I have a head start?

16:16.758 --> 16:18.716
Five, four...

16:18.760 --> 16:20.240
Save me, Bill!...three...

16:20.283 --> 16:22.938
Bill's not gonna save you.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.512
Oh. Hello, Calvin.

16:31.555 --> 16:36.343
Or should I say Snoop Dogg?

16:36.386 --> 16:39.085
Do you even know who that is?

16:39.128 --> 16:40.390
Of course I do.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.697
He hosts a cooking show
with Martha Stewart.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.181
Well, I'm just here because Tina
forgot her overnight bag.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.400
Well, it's probably still up
in the bedroom. Go ahead.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.099
All right. Cool. Uh...

16:53.142 --> 16:54.448
Dave isn't here, is he?

16:54.491 --> 16:57.190
No, he's out buying
a journal with a lock.

16:59.757 --> 17:03.239
I'll just go upstairs
and get Tina's stuff.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.372
Oh, and, uh,

17:05.415 --> 17:08.505
she told me that, uh,
I'm supposed to give you this.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.333
Five dollars?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.292
Yeah, I accidentally knocked
Dave's toothbrush

17:12.335 --> 17:14.294
into the toilet.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.035
How did that happen?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.601
Just take the money.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.049
The hell are you doing here?

17:30.092 --> 17:32.312
What the hell happened
to the rest of your robe?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.446
Gemma let you in here?

17:36.490 --> 17:38.579
She sure did.

17:38.622 --> 17:42.061
Hold up. Did Tina leave
her bag here on purpose?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.628
She sure did.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.762
The two of you are gonna stay
here until you work this out.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.851
Oh.
The hell I am.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.028
You know you can't
stop me, right?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.725
Bring it.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.470
Dave, we gonna have
to work this out, man.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.649
I'm glad to hear that.
We'll be downstairs.

18:05.693 --> 18:09.740
Oh, and, Dave,
don't brush your teeth.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.267
You know,
none of this would've happened

18:14.310 --> 18:16.704
if you would've just came
and talked to me like a man

18:16.747 --> 18:19.794
instead of writing it down
in your little book.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.796
Well, I wouldn't write about you

18:21.839 --> 18:24.015
if you didn't insult me
all the time.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.365
I don't insult you.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.367
The other day you called me
"flamingo knees."

18:27.410 --> 18:30.500
That's not an insult.
That's a fact.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.763
Stand on one leg. You'll see it.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.765
Damn it.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.334
You know what your problem is?

18:38.378 --> 18:39.901
You don't care
if you hurt people.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.207
Look, I'm just keeping it real.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.512
Oh, okay, maybe I should just
"keep it real,"

18:42.556 --> 18:44.035
and see how you like it.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.515
Come on. Come at me, Dave.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.603
Your hairline's receding.

18:49.432 --> 18:53.349
Oh. Oh, we keeping it real real.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.439
Yeah, doesn't feel
so good, does it?

18:56.483 --> 18:59.181
Look, man, you can't take
what I say so personal.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.792
Well, uh, then, why do you take
what I wrote so personal?

19:01.836 --> 19:03.707
Because that's
totally different.
How?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.840
What I'm doing to you,
I'm just messing around.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.189
But what you wrote about me,

19:07.233 --> 19:08.973
that was an attack
on my character.

19:09.017 --> 19:13.108
Says the guy who went through
my stuff and read my journal?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
Okay. All right, you know...

19:17.547 --> 19:19.506
I mean, you know,
you got me on that one.

19:19.549 --> 19:23.597
You know, I'm... I was wrong
for that, and I apologize.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.815
Thank you.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.904
Look, man,
but I'm the kind of dude

19:26.948 --> 19:28.471
that's always gonna say
what I mean,

19:28.515 --> 19:30.430
so if we're gonna be friends,

19:30.473 --> 19:31.953
you're gonna have
to deal with that.

19:31.996 --> 19:35.826
Okay, fine. But I'm gonna
deal with it my way.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.524
Fine.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.440
You know, 'cause if
you think about it--

19:40.483 --> 19:43.617
and I know a lot of people say
this about me--

19:43.660 --> 19:45.662
I'm just too funny.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.233
All right.All right.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.495
We back to being us?

19:52.539 --> 19:54.367
We're good, man.
All right.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.599
You know,
we'll keep working on that.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.391
Oh, since when
did we get Netflix?

20:18.434 --> 20:21.524
Since your dad stole
Dave's password.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.439
Yeah, see, that explains
why the "continue watching"

20:23.483 --> 20:26.573
is Marley & Me.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.532
Come on, Calvin, we're ready
to start the movie!

20:29.576 --> 20:31.142
CALVIN:
I'm coming!

20:36.147 --> 20:39.107
Oh, oh. Marley & Me.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.804
Yeah.
