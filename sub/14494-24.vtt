00:16.951 --> 00:19.685
You dare come here
and challenge me?

00:19.685 --> 00:23.205
Tell your master
he has made a grave mistake.

00:23.205 --> 00:25.369
No one challenges Karnilla.

00:25.369 --> 00:26.635
I am...

00:35.026 --> 00:36.591
Well done, Mortal.

00:36.801 --> 00:40.602
Zemo was right,
your power is impressive.

00:42.791 --> 00:45.280
The Norn queen
is a formidable opponent.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.472
Or was at least.

00:47.865 --> 00:52.249
Come, Skurge, let's us give
the grey gargoyle his reward.

00:52.249 --> 00:56.109
And then we should
collect our prize.

01:07.476 --> 01:11.456
Oh, how much longer are we
supposed to wait, Zemo?

01:11.456 --> 01:14.425
All will be revealed soon,
abomination.

01:21.143 --> 01:23.913
The time has come, Mortals.

01:23.913 --> 01:25.418
As promised.

01:33.230 --> 01:37.026
Ah, the Norn stones
you spoke of.

01:39.438 --> 01:42.159
How are a bunch of rocks supposed
to help us take over the world?

01:42.477 --> 01:45.526
The stones are but
the first step, Chemistro.

01:45.526 --> 01:47.476
And where is grey gargoyle?

01:47.476 --> 01:49.137
The battle was hard fought.

01:49.137 --> 01:52.069
He did not make it.

01:54.250 --> 01:58.071
Today we become
the masters of Earth.

02:51.599 --> 02:54.479
<i>â™ª assemble, we are strong â™ª</i>

02:54.479 --> 02:58.268
<i>â™ª forever fight as one â™ª</i>

03:01.433 --> 03:03.348
Gentlemen,
prepare to be amazed.

03:03.348 --> 03:04.712
Okay.

03:04.712 --> 03:06.899
Well, this is for Thor, mostly.

03:06.899 --> 03:07.894
And no offense, cap.

03:07.894 --> 03:09.027
None taken.

03:11.962 --> 03:13.263
You were saying, iron man?

03:13.859 --> 03:15.854
Right. As you know,
T'challa and I have been

03:15.854 --> 03:18.017
working on a way to get you
back into Asgard.

03:18.017 --> 03:19.147
We think we've got it.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.408
I do not understand
how this machine

03:27.408 --> 03:30.693
can Pierce the veil between
Midgard and the other realms.

03:30.693 --> 03:32.415
What we need is a weak spot,

03:32.415 --> 03:34.621
somewhere the two planes
overlap.

03:34.621 --> 03:37.156
In that spot, we use the door
to create a wormhole.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.234
You go in here,
you come out in Asgard.

03:44.450 --> 03:47.184
Truly, my friends,
I'm impressed.

03:47.184 --> 03:48.852
Not to rain
on your parade, Tony.

03:50.972 --> 03:53.445
But I saw a similar machine
do that same kind of thing

03:53.445 --> 03:54.501
back in my day.

03:54.890 --> 03:55.955
It worked, too.

03:57.581 --> 03:58.935
Where?

04:03.018 --> 04:04.504
It wasn't your fault, Hank.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.818
You couldn't have known
what would happen with Ultron.

04:06.818 --> 04:08.302
You don't understand, jan.

04:08.302 --> 04:09.882
I should have.

04:09.882 --> 04:13.049
After all, my mind was
the basis for Ultron's

04:17.668 --> 04:19.180
this is not your fault.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.622
You are not Ultron.

04:20.622 --> 04:23.065
Thor's alive
and everything worked out.

04:23.065 --> 04:24.980
We're going to be okay, Hank.

04:27.006 --> 04:28.487
Please, don't leave.

04:29.671 --> 04:31.357
Jan, the whole time
I've been with the avengers,

04:31.357 --> 04:33.261
I've been betraying
everything I believe in.

04:33.261 --> 04:36.426
I embraced violence, and then
created something worse.

04:36.426 --> 04:40.138
I created a robot that almost
ended all life on Earth.

04:40.138 --> 04:43.006
That's about as far from okay
as I can imagine.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.042
<i>Wasp, we need
you in the assembly room.</i>

04:58.042 --> 05:00.149
<i>You're gonna want to hear this.</i>

05:00.518 --> 05:01.409
Bucky and I had infiltrated

05:01.409 --> 05:02.916
a hydra base in Norway,

05:04.799 --> 05:06.277
rumor was that the red skull

05:06.277 --> 05:08.207
had some kind
of doomsday weapon there.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.691
But what we found was beyond
anything we'd ever seen.

05:13.408 --> 05:15.375
The skull had a machine
similar to yours

05:15.375 --> 05:19.023
and he was pulling monsters
through it into our world.

05:19.023 --> 05:22.694
He was enslaving them, putting
collars on the creatures.

05:23.473 --> 05:25.722
He was creating an army
to take over the world.

05:40.912 --> 05:42.515
And if Bucky and I
hadn't stopped him...

05:42.928 --> 05:44.327
But you did, captain.

05:44.327 --> 05:46.554
And from your tale,
it would seem that

05:46.554 --> 05:50.542
this red skull did indeed open a
portal to the Asgardian realms.

05:50.542 --> 05:54.536
The creatures you describe,
they are familiar to me.

05:54.868 --> 05:57.645
Hang on, I've got satellite
images coming in on hydra base.

06:00.786 --> 06:03.205
Jarvis, trace the energy
coming from that location.

06:06.370 --> 06:08.748
This spot.
This is what I was talking about.

06:08.748 --> 06:10.330
This is a point where
two planes are overlapping

06:10.330 --> 06:13.111
like a dimensional fault line.

06:13.411 --> 06:15.143
Fancy.
So what are we looking at?

06:15.143 --> 06:16.404
Ley lines.

06:16.404 --> 06:19.874
Veins of magic that run through our
world, connecting it to others.

06:19.874 --> 06:21.801
Or, as iron man would say,

06:21.801 --> 06:24.485
paths of other-dimensional
energy that reveal weak spots

06:24.485 --> 06:26.077
between the dimensions.

06:26.077 --> 06:29.142
In this case, there are eight,
not counting Earth.

06:29.142 --> 06:31.074
One for each realm.

06:31.074 --> 06:34.925
It is said the nine realms
are interconnected by Yggradsil,

06:34.925 --> 06:36.221
the tree of life.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.536
Big tree.

06:37.536 --> 06:38.468
Call it whatever you want.

06:38.468 --> 06:40.007
This is how we're
gonna get you home.

06:40.007 --> 06:42.966
<i>Alert, dimensional
energy flares in progress.</i>

06:42.966 --> 06:45.552
Something's affecting the energy
at each of the locations,

06:45.552 --> 06:48.033
except one that's
in an active volcano.

06:49.903 --> 06:51.237
Thor, wait.

06:51.237 --> 06:53.445
Nay. If the threat we face
is Asgardian,

06:53.445 --> 06:55.976
I will not allow it to put
Midgard in jeopardy again.

06:55.976 --> 06:58.704
Well, we Mortals
certainly appreciate that.

06:58.704 --> 07:00.197
But you're on a team, remember?

07:00.197 --> 07:02.287
Seven locations,
seven avengers.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.591
Whatever's going on,
we'll deal with it together.

07:27.151 --> 07:28.772
Stay in radio contact.

07:29.213 --> 07:30.910
If you find anything,
call it in.

07:31.529 --> 07:32.463
Avengers, assem...

07:33.053 --> 07:35.424
well, actually,
avengers, dissemble.

07:35.424 --> 07:36.224
They are coming.

07:40.889 --> 07:43.419
You can finally earn
your reward, Zemo.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.959
For if you and your team
succeed today,

07:45.959 --> 07:49.011
you will be given Midgard
as promised.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.179
You need not worry,
enchantress.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.237
I know their strengths
and weakness now.

07:54.237 --> 07:58.748
I know the avengers better
than they know themselves.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.467
Guys, I think
I've got something.

08:12.467 --> 08:14.529
Some kind of glowy,
magic looking rock.

08:14.529 --> 08:15.591
Hang on.

08:23.452 --> 08:25.999
If got any last words
for your friends,

08:25.999 --> 08:28.041
now's the time.

08:29.345 --> 08:30.906
Anyone want to switch spots?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.393
<i>Jan repeat. What's happening?</i>

08:35.393 --> 08:38.220
<i>It's a trap.
Abomination is here.</i>

08:38.220 --> 08:40.864
Wasp, get out of there. Wasp!

08:41.100 --> 08:42.443
<i>Magical energy source located.</i>

08:42.443 --> 08:44.472
<i>Warning, pulse in progress.</i>

08:59.221 --> 09:00.255
Laser!

09:00.255 --> 09:02.182
That's living laser, iron man.

09:02.182 --> 09:06.985
Living, as in something you're not
going to be in about five seconds.

09:06.985 --> 09:09.393
You have no idea

09:09.393 --> 09:12.223
how much I've been
looking forward to this.

09:21.226 --> 09:22.325
I don't know if you heard him,

09:22.325 --> 09:24.037
but iron man
recommended you run.

09:35.682 --> 09:37.297
You're done, do you hear me?

09:37.297 --> 09:39.324
There's no escape for you.

10:11.256 --> 10:12.345
Paste pot Pete?

10:17.538 --> 10:19.337
No, wait, you're
the hypno-hustler.

10:19.337 --> 10:20.515
Am I right?

10:20.515 --> 10:22.871
How can you not
remember who I am?

10:22.871 --> 10:24.371
You punched me in the face!

10:24.371 --> 10:26.725
That doesn't really
narrow it down, pal.

10:26.725 --> 10:30.517
I'm warning
you, avenger, back off.

10:30.517 --> 10:32.153
I don't want to fight you,

10:32.153 --> 10:33.698
but I can't let you
have the stone.

10:33.698 --> 10:36.683
I can only assume
the other masters of evil

10:36.683 --> 10:39.102
have been dispatched
to the remaining six locations.

10:39.102 --> 10:41.590
What interest does
Zemo have in Asgard?

10:43.038 --> 10:46.631
Zemo, he... it's nothing
that you can stop.

10:46.631 --> 10:49.309
I hear the doubt in your voice.

10:49.309 --> 10:52.796
Whatever Zemo is planning,
you obviously have reservations.

10:52.796 --> 10:54.485
You don't understand.

10:54.485 --> 10:57.923
What? That Zemo is
keeping you alive?

10:57.923 --> 11:00.537
I believe that Wakandan science

11:00.537 --> 11:02.275
could solve
your problem as well.

11:02.275 --> 11:05.759
Come, let us discuss this
like rational men.

11:36.683 --> 11:39.069
Avengers, I believe
I have found the source

11:39.069 --> 11:42.195
of the disturbances detected
by iron man's computer.

11:42.762 --> 11:46.423
It is a Norn stone,
an artifact of Asgardian magic

11:46.423 --> 11:49.381
created by Asgard's
most powerful sorceress.

11:49.381 --> 11:52.655
You insult me, Odinson.

11:54.269 --> 11:58.174
Karnilla's power is nothing
compared to mine.

11:58.174 --> 12:02.396
Dynamo, shut down
the avengers' communications.

12:06.697 --> 12:08.367
What is the meaning of this,
enchantress?

12:08.367 --> 12:10.557
Why have you brought
the Norn stones to Midgard?

12:10.557 --> 12:14.276
Midgard was once the center
of the nine realms.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.492
I am going to make it
the middle realm once again.

12:17.492 --> 12:19.660
The stones are going
to tear down the walls

12:19.660 --> 12:22.009
between Asgard and Earth.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.436
You are more of a fool
than I originally thought, Zemo,

12:27.436 --> 12:29.080
if you think that...

12:30.336 --> 12:32.536
What do you mean all
communications are down? Why?

12:32.536 --> 12:34.448
<i>External interference.</i>

12:38.920 --> 12:40.376
Having fun yet?

12:40.376 --> 12:42.165
What are you
even doing here, parks?

12:42.165 --> 12:43.465
What is it you're after?

12:43.465 --> 12:45.148
Zemo wants something.

12:45.148 --> 12:47.160
Don't know what, don't care,

12:47.160 --> 12:49.614
because I'm doing
exactly what I want,

12:49.614 --> 12:52.726
turning you into
a smoking pile of ash.

12:54.097 --> 12:55.723
You're useless, bug.

12:55.723 --> 12:57.196
You know that, right?

12:58.972 --> 13:02.318
Even the guys with no powers,
with the shield and the bow,

13:02.318 --> 13:04.468
even they'd put up
more of a fight.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.567
You? You're nothing.

13:09.210 --> 13:12.349
Maybe so, but I'm still
gonna kick your sorry hide.

13:24.661 --> 13:25.944
I should of brought my camera.

13:25.944 --> 13:27.291
No one's ever gonna believe...

13:56.471 --> 13:59.894
Iron man did exactly
as I knew he would, the fool.

13:59.894 --> 14:01.804
He divided the avengers.

14:01.804 --> 14:03.562
And while
they may have defeated

14:03.562 --> 14:05.587
my masters of evil as a team,

14:05.587 --> 14:09.239
individually they will fall.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.859
Think to test your strength
against mine, Mortal?

14:13.413 --> 14:14.517
I have no need to,

14:14.517 --> 14:18.514
because your defeat was planned
before you even arrived.

14:31.617 --> 14:32.507
Fool.

14:32.507 --> 14:34.890
You had your chance
to escape this.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.320
But you turned your back on me.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.368
For your arrogance,
Midgard will pay the price.

15:22.432 --> 15:25.182
Say goodbye, girl.

15:51.042 --> 15:52.257
Are you okay?

15:52.257 --> 15:53.299
Yeah.

15:53.299 --> 15:55.223
Hank, I can't believe you came.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.344
And... oh, wait.

15:57.344 --> 16:00.034
Can I change my answer
about being okay?

16:15.403 --> 16:16.641
What's going on?

16:16.641 --> 16:18.402
Isn't this your plan, genius?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.067
<i>Kto... who is there?
Show yourselves!</i>

16:49.410 --> 16:51.235
Do not trust
the enchantress, Zemo.

16:51.235 --> 16:53.872
Whatever she promised you,
it is a lie.

16:54.204 --> 16:55.983
To her, mortals are nothing,

16:55.983 --> 16:57.830
they are beneath Asgardians.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.617
Not equals
to be bargained with.

17:00.859 --> 17:03.620
Do you really believe
that I ever trusted her?

17:07.175 --> 17:08.255
You dare?

17:17.262 --> 17:20.404
Now, enchantress,
continue your spell.

17:20.404 --> 17:22.644
But when the armies of Asgard
come to Earth,

17:22.644 --> 17:25.670
I want them under my control.

17:39.303 --> 17:41.001
Huh, light weight.

17:55.812 --> 17:57.240
No, stay away!

17:57.780 --> 17:59.403
I'm afraid I can't
do that, dynamo.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.527
<i>Nyet. Nyet, please!</i>

18:06.897 --> 18:09.721
Always stay focused
on the matter at hand, comrade.

18:12.283 --> 18:14.325
<i>Anyone listening?
We got a big problem here.</i>

18:22.675 --> 18:24.094
Hey, hey, help me!

18:24.427 --> 18:25.457
Get this armor off me.

18:25.457 --> 18:26.842
This stuff is dangerous.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.365
No kidding.

18:31.183 --> 18:32.433
Uh, does anyone know
how to stop this,

18:32.433 --> 18:33.858
whatever it is?

18:33.858 --> 18:35.727
There's an elf here
giving me a dirty look.

18:48.370 --> 18:50.262
What is this?
What's happening?

18:50.470 --> 18:52.928
I do not know, Sam Williams, but if

18:52.928 --> 18:57.911
do you truly believe
that there will be a world left
