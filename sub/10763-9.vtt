00:10.176 --> 00:11.473
Hey, Daph. Hello, Martin.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.037
What's that?

00:14.147 --> 00:15.715
Oh, it's Frasier and
Niles's old playpen.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.217
Got it out of storage for you.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.219
Looks a bit rickety.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.016
Nah, it just needs a
little weight to balance it.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.723
Put a baby in there, and it'll be fine.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.213
(both gasping)

00:28.728 --> 00:30.230
You're not putting my
baby in that deathtrap,

00:30.230 --> 00:32.130
and by the way, did you move your gun

00:32.631 --> 00:34.134
out to storage, like you promised?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.635
I'm getting to it.

00:35.635 --> 00:38.138
What? That gun is
still around? Oh, geez.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.129
Dad, two years ago, I
demanded you get rid of it.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.142
You said you did.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.143
Don't tell me it's still in your closet.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.211
No. It's in a shoe box under my bed.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.514
Well, I don't want it
he re in my apartment.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.582
All right, all right,
it'll go into storage today,

00:49.582 --> 00:51.584
but I don't know what we'll
do if a burglar breaks in.

00:51.584 --> 00:55.188
You could lure him into that playpen.

00:55.188 --> 00:58.091
You slept awfully late. Mm, yeah,

00:58.091 --> 01:00.193
oh, well, I was having
the most distressing dream.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.495
I was climbing up a volcano

01:02.495 --> 01:06.199
that was spewing ice instead of lava.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.326
Ice volcano. Wonder
what that could mean.

01:08.701 --> 01:09.769
Oh, what's this?

01:09.769 --> 01:10.758
Hello, it's Lilith.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.772
Oh, well... Ah, okay.

01:12.772 --> 01:13.761
We're supposed to be having breakfast,

01:14.274 --> 01:15.263
but you're not here,

01:15.542 --> 01:17.510
and, as I don't know if you're tardy

01:17.844 --> 01:19.412
or have been in a terrible accident,

01:19.412 --> 01:22.745
I am unable to commit to an
appropriate emotional response.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.516
Please call me. Thank you.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.520
Oh, damn, I completely forgot.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.222
Lilith is in town for
a one-day conference.

01:29.222 --> 01:30.523
Now I'll have to
canceI lunch to see her.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.218
Can't you catch her on the next trip?

01:32.525 --> 01:33.389
No, no, she'll only be hurt,

01:33.626 --> 01:35.228
and of course, she'll...
she'll dredge it up

01:35.228 --> 01:37.219
the next time she needs
an emotional trump card.

01:37.730 --> 01:41.461
Ooh! Maybe I can trick her
into canceling lunch on me.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.804
Instead of playing games, why
don't you just talk to her ? .

01:44.804 --> 01:46.306
We tried talking when we were married.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.295
We were better at games.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.811
Hello, Lilith. It's
Frasier. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.301
I was on my way to breakfast, and, uh...

01:53.813 --> 01:55.804
I-I swerved to avoid
hitting a Pomeranian,

01:56.316 --> 01:59.119
and I-I ran up on the
curb and blew a tire.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.254
All right, well, maybe if
you come by here for lunch.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.814
(gasps) She won't, she won 't.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.325
Okay, then.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.225
All right, see you
here around 1 :00. Okay.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.152
Damn.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.156
She came to play.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.300
Hey. Hello.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.563
Hey, Niles. Hey, Dad.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.268
Hey, do you want to join us for lunch?

02:24.577 --> 02:25.578
We're trying a new Indonesian place

02:25.578 --> 02:27.273
that's famous for its Besengek Daging.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.850
Well, wish I could,
but I promised Frasier

02:30.850 --> 02:32.852
I'd stay here till he
got back from the dentist.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.321
Oh, well, we'll keep you company.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.186
Why'd he need you to hang around?

02:37.590 --> 02:39.148
He's making lunch for Lilith.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.149
And off we go.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.163
(doorbell rings)

02:43.163 --> 02:44.664
Too late.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.166
Shouldn't you get the door?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.667
You're closer.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.668
I don't live here.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.170
Doesn't matter. You're family.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.161
So is Daphne... Oh, no, you don't.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.604
LILITH: Maybe if you slid me a key,

02:54.240 --> 02:55.502
I could let myself in.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.246
Hey, Lilith!

03:00.246 --> 03:01.514
Sorry for the holdup, but, uh,

03:01.514 --> 03:03.209
Frasier should be back
from the dentist any minute.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.505
Oh, all right.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.515
That'll give us a chance to visit.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.228
Daphne, Niles, congratulations

03:15.228 --> 03:18.231
on the successful commingling
of your genetic material.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.532
Thank you.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.521
Do you know the sex?

03:21.234 --> 03:22.531
Do we? That's how we got pregnant.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.536
Thank you. No, we're-we're...

03:28.241 --> 03:29.242
we're going to let it be a surprise.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.543
Oh, okay. Please sit down.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.545
Thank you.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.248
Well, if I was to
guess the gender--

03:35.248 --> 03:38.551
and I'm usually right
about half the time...

03:38.551 --> 03:39.540
I'm being humorous, of course.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.254
(laughs)

03:41.254 --> 03:43.556
 I would say it's a boy.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.258
Oh. What makes you say that?

03:45.258 --> 03:46.559
Well, it's highly unscientific,

03:46.559 --> 03:48.261
but the proverbial old wives

03:48.261 --> 03:51.264
would cite the spreading of your nose,

03:51.264 --> 03:53.566
the unevenness of your breasts,

03:53.566 --> 03:56.933
and the coarse black hair on your legs.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.675
Interesting.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.667
Is that the shoe box
from under your bed, then?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.239
(cell phone ringing)

04:10.383 --> 04:11.441
Excuse me.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.454
Hello?

04:14.454 --> 04:15.955
Yes, Frasier.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.457
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

04:17.457 --> 04:18.958
Hear what?

04:18.958 --> 04:20.447
He's still coming, isn't he?

04:20.760 --> 04:21.861
Yes, all right, all right.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.863
I'll meet you then. Bye.

04:23.863 --> 04:24.864
Frasier can't make it.

04:24.864 --> 04:25.865
Oh...

04:25.865 --> 04:27.867
well, if you still want lunch,

04:27.867 --> 04:29.858
I've got leftover meat loaf 
that's today or never.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.872
Thank you, but I'll get
something at the conference.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.873
Ahh...

04:33.873 --> 04:35.375
There's a bulimia talk today

04:35.375 --> 04:37.377
and I'll wager that's one lecture hall

04:37.377 --> 04:39.379
with a snack machine outside.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.744
Lovely to see you.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.549
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.984
Did you hear what she said about me?

04:44.984 --> 04:46.452
Yes.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.454
That I've got a flat nose,
uneven boobs and bristly legs?

04:48.454 --> 04:49.756
I mean, are they really that bad?

04:49.756 --> 04:51.758
Not bad.

04:51.758 --> 04:56.462
Maybe a little cock-eyed,
but with a heavy sweater...

04:56.462 --> 04:58.453
I was talking about my legs.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.768
Oh, forget about lunch.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.463
I'm just going to make a sandwich.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.762
Oh, no, hey... what about me?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.337
Oh, have a banana.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.010
(gunshot)

05:11.010 --> 05:12.011
DAPHNE: My God!

05:12.011 --> 05:13.012
What was that?

05:13.012 --> 05:16.516
I think the banana went off.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.813
You knocked my gun on the floor.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.519
Is everyone all right?

05:19.519 --> 05:20.520
Daphne, are you all right?

05:20.520 --> 05:21.987
Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, you okay?

05:22.522 --> 05:23.887
Yeah, I'm fine. I don't understand this.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.755
I thought the safety was on.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.960
Oh, my God, it blew a hole
through Frasier's chair.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.362
(Martin gasping)

05:29.362 --> 05:32.365
And it shot the head off the statue.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.368
Look what it did to the fireplace.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.636
MARTIN: Oh, no, Frasier's
going to kill me.

05:36.636 --> 05:37.704
This is why I've been telling you

05:37.704 --> 05:39.069
to put the bloody thing in storage.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.873
Niles was the one who
knocked it off the table.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.376
Well, accidentally, because
I had a banana thrown at me!

05:43.376 --> 05:45.378
To you, not at you.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.381
And you should know
how to catch a banana!

05:48.381 --> 05:50.110
I am not having this argument again!

05:52.118 --> 05:54.687
If Frasier sees this,
I'll never hear the end of it. 

05:54.687 --> 05:57.554
You guys have to help me fix
things up before he gets home.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.759
Forget it, old man. You're on your own.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.095
If he kicks me out over
this, I'm moving in with you.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.497
All right, what's the plan? . 

06:04.497 --> 06:05.898
You start calling upholsterers.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.889
Niles, get me some Spackle.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.460
I'll see if I can Crazy Glue
the head back on that thing.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.434
Dad, Dad... what's Spackle?

06:23.449 --> 06:25.952
Anyway, long story short,

06:25.952 --> 06:30.456
" . six months in he says
I'm "too tightly wound

06:30.456 --> 06:31.445
Me.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.961
Wow, I don't know what to tell you, Lil.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.452
Lilith. My name is Lilith.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.432
(pager vibrating)

06:39.432 --> 06:40.933
Oh, it's my beeper.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.937
Oh, darn, they need me
back at the conference.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.428
Okay, but listen, we all
have bad dating experiences,

06:47.940 --> 06:48.808
so don't give up.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.677
Get out there, have fun, meet people.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.179
You're right.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.180
Thank you, Nancy.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.681
You're a real pal.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.684
And the best survivor guilt

06:58.684 --> 07:00.675
and phantom limb expert in the game.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.191
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.192
Roz... Roz?

07:06.192 --> 07:08.694
Oh, hi, Lilith. What
are you doing in town?

07:08.694 --> 07:09.695
Well, I'm here for a conference

07:09.695 --> 07:11.697
and was supposed to meet
Frasier here for coffee,

07:11.697 --> 07:13.199
 but I'm afraid I have to leave.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.188
 Will you tell him I'll call him later?

07:14.700 --> 07:15.701
Sure, no problem.

07:15.701 --> 07:16.690
Thank you. Bye-bye.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.205
Can I have change for the meter?

07:19.205 --> 07:20.706
Only if you buy something.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.708
I don't have time--
the meter maid's coming.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.697
Sorry, can't do it.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.712
Well, someone doesn't
want his tip very much.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.214
You haven't ordered anything.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.216
I meant the tip I gave you yesterday.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.717
Oh, hi, Roz. Hey, Frasier.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.220
Oh, um, Lilith had to leave.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.209
Oh, damn! Again?

07:38.224 --> 07:39.225
Can I help you?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.214
Yes... Yes, I'd like.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.228
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
. Please, go ahead.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.229
No. that's all right. You go.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.730
No, I insist--
after you.

07:44.730 --> 07:45.731
We'll go together.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.233
What're you having?

07:47.233 --> 07:49.735
All right-- a
macchiato for here.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.737
One macchiato for here

07:51.737 --> 07:54.740
and a Mocha Valencia to go, please.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.242
Macchiato man.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.743
Don't meet many of those.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.245
No, no...

07:59.245 --> 08:01.747
We're a... a rare breed.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.738
Spartan... rugged...

08:04.250 --> 08:05.251
You like a dusting of
nutmeg on that, right?

08:05.251 --> 08:07.242
Just a sprinkle.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.255
So, is this your first time here?

08:09.255 --> 08:10.256
Yeah. I'm in town on business.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.757
First time in Seattle.

08:11.757 --> 08:13.748
That entitles you to a
complimentary beverage.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.261
These are on me.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.762
Thank you.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.755
Tell me, is there a Mrs. Macchiato?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.258
(chuckles) : No.

08:23.769 --> 08:24.770
This may sound a little crazy,

08:24.770 --> 08:26.272
but would you be interested

08:26.272 --> 08:28.774
in having a drink later
with a friend of mine?

08:28.774 --> 08:31.265
I think you might really hit it off.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.580
Well, it sounds intriguing.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.572
I'm late for a meeting,
but if you're game,

08:38.083 --> 08:40.586
Iet's just say 7:00
at the Marina Tavern.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.089
And if you change your
mind, here's my number.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.078
All right, then.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.097
Roz, have you ever been set
up on a date with someone

08:51.097 --> 08:52.598
 whose name you didn't know? .

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
Oh, please, I've woken up with dates

08:54.600 --> 08:56.102
now. whose names I didn't k

08:56.102 --> 08:57.103
Cappuccino, please.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.104
What's going on?

08:58.104 --> 09:00.606
Well, I just met this woman

09:00.606 --> 09:02.108
who's in town on business.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.111
She asked me to join a friend of hers

09:05.111 --> 09:07.113
for a drink at the Marina Tavern.

09:07.113 --> 09:10.105
Oh... well, you know there is no friend.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.618
The woman you met is
the woman you're meeting.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.108
Oh, that's what I thought.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.122
I wonder why she
wouldn't give me her name?

09:16.122 --> 09:18.124
Well, when you're in tow n on business

09:18.124 --> 09:20.115
and you hook up with a stranger,

09:20.626 --> 09:23.629
no names is standard procedure.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.620
I'm not sure that's something

09:26.132 --> 09:27.633
you want to admit knowing, Roz.

09:27.633 --> 09:31.137
I only know it from reading
Erica Jong novels, okay?

09:31.137 --> 09:33.139
I'm not sure that's something

09:33.139 --> 09:34.128
you want to admit, either.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.012
(door opening)

09:40.713 --> 09:41.702
I've got the Spackle.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.709
Good, good-- we'll
fill in the crack,

09:43.916 --> 09:45.685
then my faux finisher
can match the stone.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.687
Fabrizio is on his way
here to re-upholster.

09:47.687 --> 09:48.676
Dad, how are you doing?

09:48.988 --> 09:49.989
Great.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.991
 This glue should hold it just fine.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.992
Your guys better get over here soon.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.660
Frasier's meeting Lilith
after work at the cafe,

09:54.660 --> 09:55.962
which only gives us...

09:55.962 --> 09:56.951
FRASIER: Oh, hello, Mrs. Richman.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.297
(whispering): Shh! Frasier!

10:00.166 --> 10:02.157
Ahh!

10:10.843 --> 10:13.346
Hello, what's going on?

10:13.346 --> 10:14.836
Oh, just admiring the sunset.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.884
I think it looks best over here,

10:18.884 --> 10:20.875
but Niles thinks it
looks better over there.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.154
FRASIER: Oh, really?

10:22.154 --> 10:23.155
Oh, Niles,

10:23.155 --> 10:26.158
have you changed your
mind about my new statue?

10:26.158 --> 10:29.161
Yesterday you said it
was sterile and unmoving.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.651
 Oh, it's moving now.

10:33.699 --> 10:34.967
Well, I'd love to stay
and gloat, but I have

10:34.967 --> 10:36.669
a very intriguing date
for which I must get ready.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.330
Well, good luck with
that. Thank you, Dad.

10:38.704 --> 10:39.796
Oh, what's this?

10:40.272 --> 10:41.762
LILITH: Frasier, I'm
just leaving the cafe.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.230
Sorry I missed you.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.077
Anyway, if you're available for a drink,

10:45.077 --> 10:46.806
I'm staying at the Harbor View .

10:47.113 --> 10:47.670
Call me.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.637
Oh, dear... damn!

10:50.149 --> 10:51.138
I've got an exciting mystery date

10:51.651 --> 10:54.153
and who should rear her head
at the last minute but Lilith.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.088
MARTIN: Well, you know,
if you leave right away,

10:56.088 --> 10:57.990
you'd probably have time
for a quick drink with Lilith

10:57.990 --> 10:58.854
and still make for your date.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.159
Good thinking, Dad.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.161
I could dispense with the pleasantries

11:02.161 --> 11:04.152
and be on my way.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.653
Help me, help me. The
head is stuck to my hand.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.659
(yelling)

11:09.835 --> 11:11.370
FRASIER: On second thought...

11:11.370 --> 11:15.708
maybe I should invite Lilith here

11:15.708 --> 11:17.676
so that I can have
more time to get ready.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.445
ALL: No!

11:19.445 --> 11:20.980
She's already been here once.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.682
You should go to her.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.876
You're quite right,

11:24.383 --> 11:25.885
but, then, should I change
or am I fine the way I am?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.785
Fine. Oh, hubba-hubba.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.280
Well, then, I'll just see you all later.

11:37.997 --> 11:38.964
Dad, you're right.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.889
It's a much, much
different sunset from here.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:52.378 --> 11:54.847
(flatly): Yes, of course
I'm excited, Nancy.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.882
Can't you hear it in
the timbre of my voice?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.218
Yes, well, I'm afraid I
might a little bit late.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.049
I'm still waiting for my ex-husband.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.022
(knocking) Oh, there he is.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.025
I'll get through this as
quickly as I possibly can.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.014
Yes, all right. Bye.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.730
Hi, Lilith.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.031
I'm sorry I'm late.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.733
Traffic was a bear.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
It's good to see you.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.736
Likewise.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.037
Anyway, I'm sorry about

12:18.037 --> 12:19.732
all the missed connections today,

12:20.039 --> 12:21.768
but at least we have a chance
to catch up, however briefly.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.809
Yes, well, sometimes with old friends

12:23.809 --> 12:24.798
five minutes is enough.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.112
Ha.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.913
One minute.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.281
So, care for a drink?

12:29.281 --> 12:31.016
Not if I'm keeping you from something.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.883
Well, actually, I do
have a date this evening.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.054
Oh, really?

12:35.054 --> 12:36.419
Yes. A colleague of mine fixed me up.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.923
I'm sorry for dragging you over here

12:37.923 --> 12:40.960
when I have so little time to give you.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.427
Actually, I'm running
late for a date myself.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.796
I see.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.297
Well, why don 't you run along?

12:45.297 --> 12:46.799
I wouldn't want you
to keep Niles waiting.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.198
(chuckles)

12:48.501 --> 12:50.069
No. It is
with a woman--

12:50.069 --> 12:52.299
a very vibrant, sexy woman.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.136
Ah. Good for you.

12:53.839 --> 12:54.134
Listen, if you're running late

12:54.774 --> 12:55.900
and you need to cancel our drink...

12:56.175 --> 12:58.244
No, no, no, I've canceled
on you once already today.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.042
Well, I canceled on you twice.
 That would make us even.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.939
That's why we're having the drink.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.816
Ah.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.385
Unless you're worried
that your sexy date

13:06.385 --> 13:07.943
will leave if you' re five minutes late.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.255
Oh, no, not at all.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.256
My absence will only make

13:10.256 --> 13:11.824
her heart grow fonder.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.826
You mind if I use the bathroom?

13:13.826 --> 13:14.815
Certainly. Thank you.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.456
Please don't leave. Please don't leave.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.456
Please don't leave.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.972
Hello.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.407
Miss Mocha Valencia.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.810
Yes, Macchiatto man here.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.074
Uh, listen, I'm glad I caught you.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.914
Hi. Where are you?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.415
Uh, well...

13:36.415 --> 13:38.406
something's come up, and
I'm afraid I have to...

13:38.918 --> 13:40.408
Wait, hang on. I have another call.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.921
Fine.

13:41.921 --> 13:42.910
Hello.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.411
Nancy, it's Lilith again.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.414
Listen, this thing with my ex-husband

13:46.926 --> 13:48.427
is taking a lot longer than I expected,

13:48.427 --> 13:50.429
but I will be there, I promise you.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.864
Uh-oh.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.263
 What do you mean "uh-oh"

13:53.966 --> 13:56.168
I'm on the other line
with your date right now.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.870
I think he wants to cancel.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.172
Before he' s even met me?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.163
Tell him I canceled on him first.

14:02.875 --> 14:03.876
Okay.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.174
I'm really sorry about this.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.178
Hi. So I'm afraid tonight's off.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.184
Off?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
Yeah, that was my friend.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.880
She had second thoughts.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.189
Oh, really?

14:17.189 --> 14:20.192
Well, please tell your "friend"

14:20.192 --> 14:22.194
that I wasn't exactly bowled over

14:22.194 --> 14:23.183
by her first thoughts.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.896
I don't even know what that means.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.008
So what would you say to that drink?

14:36.008 --> 14:38.310
I'd say, don't get too
comfortable in that glass.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.299
(chuckles)

14:43.315 --> 14:45.017
Well, this is nice.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.315
Yes, very.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.322
Freddy tells me he dissected a frog.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.897
Yes, and a fetal pig.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.195
Of course, I made him
do his homework first.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.206
Lilith, you seem preoccupied.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.408
Is this about your blind date tonight?

15:09.408 --> 15:12.411
You could say that.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.346
Well, for what it's worth,
whoever this guy is...

15:16.048 --> 15:18.617
he'll feel awfully lucky when
you walk through the door.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.084
Thank you, Frasier,

15:20.586 --> 15:22.588
but I really shouldn't be
keeping you from your date.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.956
Oh, right.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.958
Well, I guess I should be going, yes.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.460
Although, you know, you
are here for just one night.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.463
Perhaps I could call and
push things back a bit?

15:31.463 --> 15:33.021
Maybe I could delay mine as well.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.066
Great.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.100
All right.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.102
What excuse are you going to use?

15:37.102 --> 15:38.604
Oh, I'll just trot
out my stand-by--

15:38.604 --> 15:39.939
it works every time.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.928
Simply say that I swerved

15:41.440 --> 15:42.942
to avoid hitting a Chihuahua,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.933
ran up on a curb and blew a tire.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.449
This morning you said
it was a Pomeranian.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.610
Well, this morning it was.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.082
FRASIER: So I'm in the
middle of this date from hell,

16:00.526 --> 16:02.161
when Kenny walks in with his cousin,

16:02.161 --> 16:04.163
whom I'd passed on sight unseen.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.165
Turns out she's not only gorgeous,

16:06.165 --> 16:08.065
but her name is actually Miss Wright.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.370
Okay, you win. Mm-hmm.

16:11.370 --> 16:15.033
Say, are there any more
kettle chips in the mini bar?

16:15.341 --> 16:18.344
No. We can have either
Gummi Bears or cashews,

16:18.344 --> 16:20.346
both. but I'm afraid we can't afford

16:20.346 --> 16:22.047
(door slams)

16:22.047 --> 16:23.036
MAN: Erin, would you stop?

16:23.349 --> 16:24.748
I don't even know what I did.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.253
ERIN: Why do you always say
that like you think it will help?

16:28.253 --> 16:30.255
Because when I guess, you get angrier!

16:30.255 --> 16:32.746
Boy, that takes you back, doesn't it?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.196
MAN: What, did I forget
to notice your hair?

16:37.196 --> 16:38.697
That's not why I'm mad.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.699
I'm just going to ask them to be quiet.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.701
MAN: I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

16:42.701 --> 16:43.690
I'm going out.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.204
ERIN: Sean, what are you doing?

16:45.204 --> 16:46.205
Oh, uh... Sorry.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.706
That's not the hall.

16:47.706 --> 16:48.707
Yes, uh...

16:48.707 --> 16:50.572
It's all right.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.112
You see, we overheard your quarrel,

16:53.112 --> 16:56.281
and in the interest of
keeping the peace and quiet,

16:56.281 --> 16:58.283
maybe we could offer some assistance.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.285
It's okay, we can handle it ourselves.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.776
Oh, can you, Sean?

17:03.288 --> 17:05.279
You don't even know what you did.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.148
Please, won't you come in?

17:11.730 --> 17:13.232
We are psychiatrists.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.233
There's no need to be afraid.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.569
We are here to help.

17:17.569 --> 17:21.561
So, what, you're like caped
crusaders for mental health?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.405
No, not caped.

17:24.777 --> 17:25.835
Please, come and sit down.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.211
All right then.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.151
What seems to be the problem?

17:32.151 --> 17:33.140
Uh...

17:33.452 --> 17:35.154
When we were at dinner,

17:35.154 --> 17:37.456
he was checking out another woman.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.324
And you feel threatened by this?

17:39.324 --> 17:41.258
Shouldn't I? Well, maybe.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.095
 Shot in the dark here:

17:43.095 --> 17:45.130
your parents are divorced; Dad left Mom.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.155
Yeah. How'd you know?

17:47.466 --> 17:49.168
It's classic transference.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.170
Because your father and mother split up,

17:51.170 --> 17:53.172
you overreact whenever
you perceive a threat

17:53.172 --> 17:55.106
to your current relationship.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.775
And, you, you care about this woman?

17:56.775 --> 17:57.643
Absolutely.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.201
Then keep your eye s in your head.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.813
It bugs her and it's bad form. 

18:03.282 --> 18:04.783
And if he should fail at this,

18:04.783 --> 18:06.273
which he will,
he's a man--

18:06.652 --> 18:08.787
it does not mean he's
going to leave you.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.517
you. Or that I don't love

18:12.291 --> 18:13.223
Because I do.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.427
I know.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.792
I love you, too.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.529
Wow, you guys are good.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.772
ERIN: Yeah, that was amazing.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.240
So, do you two just have
the best marriage ever?

18:33.512 --> 18:34.513
Actually...

18:34.513 --> 18:37.209
Yes... we do.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.285
Well, uh... thank you.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.787
It was really nice meeting you.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.776
Likewise, likewise.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.491
You seem like an awfully
nice young couple,

18:45.491 --> 18:48.494
and I'm sure you'll
understand if I lock the door.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.483
Good night.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.230
Good night.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.857
Well done, Dr. Crane.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.167
Back at you, Dr. Sternin.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.169
I'd suggest that we try a high five

18:57.169 --> 18:59.171
but I recall we attempted that once

18:59.171 --> 19:02.163
after a bridge victory and
you scratched my cornea.

19:04.443 --> 19:08.480
Well, I guess we shouldn't kee
our dates waiting any longer.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.710
Right.

19:13.252 --> 19:15.554
Good luck on your romantic
adventure this evening, Lilith.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.256
Don't you
worry--

19:17.256 --> 19:18.917
you're going to knock his socks off.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.726
Frasier...

19:20.726 --> 19:23.593
I don't have a date
anymore. He canceled.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.397
You're kidding.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.900
No. I was too proud to admit it to you.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.367
How pathetic is that?

19:31.436 --> 19:34.428
Well, there's no need to
beat yourself up about it.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.445
Come on. A fake phone
call to "buy time"?

19:40.445 --> 19:41.947
It's understandable.

19:41.947 --> 19:45.384
Just a face-saving
gesture in the light of...

19:45.384 --> 19:47.944
Oh, my God, your date
canceled on you, too.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.752
All right, yes.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.246
It's a banner day for both of us.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.260
All this lying has certainly
worked up my appetite.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.249
You want to get room service?

19:56.762 --> 19:58.263
That might be nice.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.264
Okay.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.754
Certainly beats sitting alone

20:01.266 --> 20:03.268
wondering what we missed
out on this evening, hmm?

20:03.268 --> 20:05.759
SEAN: Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

20:07.272 --> 20:09.331
(loud erotic moaning)

20:13.912 --> 20:14.913
Frasier?

20:14.913 --> 20:16.403
Hmm? Hmm.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.906
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.409
I must have dozed off during the movie.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.921
Me, too.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.411
What time is it?

20:24.957 --> 20:26.447
Uh... it's almost 6:00.

20:26.925 --> 20:27.914
6:00?

20:28.427 --> 20:29.917
I have a 7:30 flight.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.420
Well, I'll just get out of your hair.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.423
Listen, Lilith, dinner
was lovely last night.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.902
I had a great time.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.905
Yes. Well, much better
than those blind dates

20:39.905 --> 20:41.406
could have possibly been.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.308
Absolutely.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.711
Well, listen, have a
safe trip and all that,

20:45.711 --> 20:47.406
and give Freddy a hug for me.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.705
I will. All right.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.647
You know, it's funny... What?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.619
Well, I was just thinking
that if we had never met,

20:53.619 --> 20:56.288
we're exactly the kind of peopIe

20:56.288 --> 20:58.557
that somebody might
set up on a blind date.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.890
You always were one
for droll hypotheticals.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.863
Yes. It's amusing to consider, though.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.865
What would we think of each other

21:06.865 --> 21:09.299
if we were just meeting
now for the first time?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.936
But if we hadn't met,
we'd be different people now.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.925
Ah, true.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.939
But then that raises
many other questions.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.341
I mean, what sort of man would
the non-Lilith Frasier be?

21:16.341 --> 21:17.409
What sort of woman...?

21:17.409 --> 21:19.400
Did I mention I have a plane to catch?

21:19.611 --> 21:20.612
Of course.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.315
But you're right.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.317
It was a lovely evening.

21:25.317 --> 21:29.288
We do have our baggage, don't we?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.280
But then sometimes that's what
makes the trip so interesting.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.296
With one hand, the
past moves us forward,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.287
and with the other, it holds us back.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.471
Good-bye, Lilith.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.630
Good-bye, Frasier.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.578
