I had to knock you out.
-No, that --

50:30.723 --> 50:31.898
that didn't happen!
-It did!

50:32.029 --> 50:33.247
-Then why don't I remember?!

50:33.378 --> 50:36.207
-It's not your fault.
You weren't you.

50:36.337 --> 50:40.254
-We've heard him talk about
what "Seeing Red" was like

50:40.385 --> 50:42.126
when he was
in his clear days.

50:42.256 --> 50:44.693
But it was really important
to us to actually see

50:44.824 --> 50:49.307
what that looks like
from inside of Morgan's mind.

50:49.437 --> 50:51.004
-Her name...

50:51.135 --> 50:53.354
-What we really wanted to do
was give the sense

50:53.485 --> 50:55.748
that Morgan was completely
out of control,

50:55.878 --> 51:00.796
that he lost sense of time,
of place, of who he was with.

51:00.927 --> 51:04.583
And we do that through what in
script we we called "red jumps."

51:04.713 --> 51:09.762
And it was essentially kind of
what Morgan experiences

51:09.892 --> 51:11.851
when he succumbs
to the violence.

51:11.981 --> 51:14.593
And it was really creating
that sense of a man

51:14.723 --> 51:18.640
being out of control
that we want to try to capture.

51:18.771 --> 51:21.904
-I tried to stop you.

51:22.035 --> 51:24.385
They helped.

51:24.516 --> 51:27.823
-It was not an easy thing to
achieve on the production side

51:27.954 --> 51:29.564
because there were a lot
of technical challenges

51:29.695 --> 51:30.870
that came along with it.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.741
But ultimately
we are really excited

51:32.872 --> 51:35.396
about the way it turned out
and think it kind of gave us

51:35.527 --> 51:38.399
a unique perspective
into Morgan's mind,

51:38.530 --> 51:40.097
and that's really
just a testament

51:40.227 --> 51:42.011
to our production crew,

51:42.142 --> 51:43.535
to our stunt coordinators

51:43.665 --> 51:45.928
and the way
they designed everything,

51:46.059 --> 51:47.452
and ultimately to Lennie

51:47.582 --> 51:49.018
to be able
to kind of match action

51:49.149 --> 51:51.543
on both sides of those cuts.

51:51.673 --> 51:54.633
-[Grunting]

51:56.939 --> 51:59.072
God, what have I done?

52:03.381 --> 52:07.211
Where's Mo? Where is she?!
I told you to find her!

52:07.341 --> 52:08.951
-I wasn't going to
leave you to drown.

52:09.082 --> 52:10.257
-I got to stop 'em!

52:10.388 --> 52:11.040
-You're gonna
get yourself killed.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.216
-I can't lose her!

52:12.346 --> 52:13.695
-Padre!

52:13.826 --> 52:15.784
When they first
had their hooks in me,

52:15.915 --> 52:18.483
my kids were the only thing
that kept me going.

52:18.613 --> 52:22.487
Alicia, even when she thought
I was dead, she --

52:22.617 --> 52:24.141
She kept me with her.
-What are you saying?

52:24.271 --> 52:27.622
-You never really lose people,
Morgan.

52:27.753 --> 52:29.885
None of us do.

52:30.016 --> 52:33.280
-It is such a seismic moment
for him to realize

52:33.411 --> 52:37.110
that you don't have to lose
yourself when you lose people,

52:37.241 --> 52:39.504
that they become part of you
no matter what.

52:39.634 --> 52:41.332
And then when they have
that beautiful moment

52:41.462 --> 52:44.639
together in the swamp
where he's prepared to let Mo go

52:44.770 --> 52:46.467
because he knows that deep down

52:46.598 --> 52:48.208
he's never going to
really lose her.

52:48.339 --> 52:50.036
-What are you doing here?

52:50.167 --> 52:51.298
-Not here to hurt you --

52:51.429 --> 52:54.258
because I'm
letting you go, baby.

52:56.347 --> 52:58.610
-You are.
-If that's what you want.

52:58.740 --> 53:00.742
If it's what you think you need,

53:00.873 --> 53:04.268
I'm not going to stand
in your way.

53:04.398 --> 53:06.313
-I don't want to
just remember you.

53:06.444 --> 53:08.707
I want to be with you.
-Come here.

53:08.837 --> 53:11.710
-Shrike is caught off guard

53:11.840 --> 53:16.497
when she sees the walker version
of her father.

53:18.412 --> 53:19.718
-I'm so sorry!

53:19.848 --> 53:22.938
-Shrike is someone
who has spent, you know,

53:23.069 --> 53:26.333
the entirety of the apocalypse
trying to forget her father,

53:26.464 --> 53:30.772
trying to pretend like that pain
is not still with her.

53:30.903 --> 53:33.775
Actually can't shake the love
she had for her father,

53:33.906 --> 53:36.213
the connection she felt for him.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.653
-Shrike!

53:41.783 --> 53:43.220
-[Screams]

53:47.224 --> 53:48.225
[Strikes]

53:51.445 --> 53:54.361
-So I wanted to thank you

53:54.492 --> 53:57.582
for helping me to find
my daughter,

53:57.712 --> 53:59.671
and for helping me
to find myself again.

53:59.801 --> 54:02.761
-We knew it was
coming this season,

54:02.891 --> 54:06.808
and as we wrote it, we --
we knew it was happening.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.593
Then, like, the day comes
and you're like,

54:08.723 --> 54:10.159
No, this can't be happening.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.292
Lennie has been such a fixture

54:12.423 --> 54:14.294
of "Fear The Walking Dead"

54:14.425 --> 54:16.601
that it's really hard to imagine

54:16.731 --> 54:18.777
making this show without him.

54:18.907 --> 54:21.562
So there was always the hope,
at least in my heart,

54:21.693 --> 54:25.262
that we may see him again.
-Hey.

54:25.392 --> 54:27.655
Come on. We need to get going.

54:27.786 --> 54:30.789
-I'm a bit in denial that
Lennie's gone, to be honest,

54:30.919 --> 54:34.575
because he's been such a --
such a vital part

54:34.706 --> 54:36.403
of the journey for me
and Andrew.

54:36.534 --> 54:39.014
And he is as talented
as he is kind.

54:39.145 --> 54:42.453
And we know he's going to go on
to do other wonderful things,

54:42.583 --> 54:45.151
but we'll be forever grateful
to Lennie for --

54:45.282 --> 54:47.545
for his time with us
here on "Fear."

54:47.675 --> 54:51.375
-This message is for
Rick Grimes.

54:51.505 --> 54:54.073
It's Morgan Jones.

54:54.203 --> 54:55.727
Man, I'm going to come
and look for you,

54:55.857 --> 54:58.730
whether you're at Alexandria
or not.
