12:56.650 --> 12:57.860
- COOL.

12:57.943 --> 12:57.985
- COOL.

13:04.116 --> 13:04.992
WAY TOO MANY SECRETS
AROUND HERE.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.333
[all clamoring]

13:20.508 --> 13:23.677
- SETTLE DOWN, EVERYONE.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.141
I'M SURE YOU'LL ALL BE GLAD
TO HEAR

13:29.225 --> 13:32.645
THAT THIS TERM I'M INTRODUCING
A BRAND-NEW SUBJECT.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.274
BUSINESS STUDIES.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.692
- BUSINESS STUDIES?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.152
YOU MEAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO BE TEACHING US

13:40.236 --> 13:41.570
HOW TO MAKE MONEY?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
- INDIRECTLY, YES.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.742
- I LOVE THIS WOMAN.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.328
- AND FOR OUR FIRST
BUSINESS PROJECT,

13:49.411 --> 13:51.580
I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT
SNACK FOODS.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.917
- OH, I AM SO GETTING AN "A."

13:55.000 --> 13:57.086
- YOU CAN WORK ALONE
OR IN PAIRS.

13:57.169 --> 14:01.674
YOUR TASK IS TO DESIGN
AND MARKET A BRAND-NEW SNACK.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.716
YOU'LL FIND THE TASK OUTLINED
IN THESE HANDOUTS

14:02.800 --> 14:05.803
AND ON THE LINK
WHICH IS ON THE BOARD.

14:05.886 --> 14:05.970
WOULD YOU PASS THESE BACK?

14:08.889 --> 14:09.640
THE IDEAS WILL BE GRADED,

14:09.723 --> 14:11.642
BUT YOU'LL ALSO BE JUDGED

14:11.725 --> 14:15.062
BY A GLOBAL FOOD MANUFACTURER.

14:15.145 --> 14:19.358
NONE OTHER THAN AMBER'S DAD,
MR. MILLINGTON.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.568
- DADDY'S COMING HERE?

14:20.651 --> 14:21.902
- HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.362
- WILLOW,

14:23.445 --> 14:24.238
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A FACE

14:24.321 --> 14:24.947
THAT'S BEEN TOLD ANYTHING?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.118
BESIDES HOW TO MOISTURIZE?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.078
- EITHER WAY, HE'LL BE HERE
AT THE END OF THE WEEK,

14:31.161 --> 14:34.290
AND HE'S DONATING
A BRAND-NEW LAPTOP

14:34.373 --> 14:36.709
TO WHOEVER WINS.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.091
- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT HER.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.301
- WHAT?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.261
TELL EVERYONE SHE HAS A ZOMBIE
FOR A BOYFRIEND?

14:47.344 --> 14:48.971
- UH, AND YOU, EDDIE,

14:49.054 --> 14:51.807
I TRUST YOU'LL BE TAKING
THIS PROJECT SERIOUSLY.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.519
- DON'T WORRY.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.856
I'LL BE TAKING YOUR CLASSES
VERY SERIOUSLY FROM NOW ON.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.983
- YOU DO KNOW
WE HAVE TO BE SUBTLE, RIGHT?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.069
- HEY, SUBTLE IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.959
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

15:19.043 --> 15:24.381
HOW ABOUT A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
SNACK BAR CALLED

15:24.465 --> 15:26.759
"THE FREGETABLE BAR"?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.969
- [laughs]

15:29.053 --> 15:30.179
COME ON.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.015
- LIKE YOU COULD COME UP
WITH ANYTHING BETTER.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.435
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SCHOOL'S
FOREMOST ENTREPRENEUR.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.311
- UH, YEAH.
SURE.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.605
- HEY, HEY.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.483
I WILL PROVE
I'M NOT AS USELESS AS YOU THINK.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.402
HOWEVER, WHOEVER DOES THE WORST

15:45.486 --> 15:47.279
HAS TO PAY FOR OUR NEXT DATE.

15:47.363 --> 15:51.575
- GUYS, RELATIONSHIPS
AREN'T ABOUT COMPETING.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.995
THEY'RE ABOUT HARMONY
AND MUTUAL KARMA.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.708
- MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.167
- YOU TWO ARE WEIRD.

16:02.878 --> 16:03.128
- SURE.

16:05.422 --> 16:09.093
- I'VE BEEN THINKING,
IF I CAN'T SOLVE THIS,

16:09.176 --> 16:10.302
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE
THAT BRACELET BACK TO VICTOR.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.221
- YOU DON'T--
- NO, HE'S DESPERATE.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.181
WHATEVER HE WANTS IT FOR,
HE MIGHT HURT SOMEONE.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.557
- OKAY, OKAY.
YOU'RE TAKING A BREAK.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.392
- WHAT?
- NO ARGUMENTS.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.019
OKAY?

16:19.103 --> 16:21.397
LOOK, BESIDES, I NEED A PARTNER
FOR THIS BUSINESS PROJECT.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.439
- [sighs]

16:22.523 --> 16:24.942
- PLEASE?

16:30.322 --> 16:31.532
- [sighs]

16:31.615 --> 16:32.533
OKAY.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.909
- YEAH?

16:33.992 --> 16:35.119
- OKAY.
- YAY!

16:35.202 --> 16:37.162
- OKAY.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.664
YOU KNOW,

16:38.747 --> 16:40.958
I'M GLAD WE'RE SPENDING
MORE TIME TOGETHER THIS YEAR.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.001
I MISSED IT.

16:43.085 --> 16:43.961
- MISSED WHAT?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.796
- YOU KNOW, JUST US.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.463
HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.259
- [chuckles]

16:50.342 --> 16:51.301
- I'M GONNA STOP TALKING NOW.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.386
- OKAY.

16:54.054 --> 16:54.138
[bird caws]

16:56.056 --> 16:56.140
[lighter flicks]

16:58.350 --> 17:03.522
- THE THINGS I DO
FOR ETERNAL GLORY, CORBIERRE.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.316
HMM?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.401
WELL...

17:08.527 --> 17:11.780
THE BRACELET WILL SOON
BE IN MY GRASP...

17:13.531 --> 17:15.367
[soft music playing]

17:15.451 --> 17:16.242
AND THEN...

17:17.703 --> 17:20.748
I CAN FORGET ALL ABOUT
THIS ABHORRENT EVENING.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.916
[knock at door]

17:26.377 --> 17:28.130
[sighs]

17:35.471 --> 17:36.555
- TA-DA.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.892
OH, IT'S NOTHING NEW.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.519
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I HAD IT ON.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.187
STILL FITS, THOUGH.
YAY!

17:44.730 --> 17:46.982
OH, AND LOOK AT YOU.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.484
ALL DRESSED UP
JUST FOR LITTLE OLD ME.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.653
- I'M SORRY?

17:51.737 --> 17:52.821
- I'M NOT LATE, AM I?

17:52.905 --> 17:53.822
- NO.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.907
- OH!

17:54.990 --> 17:57.493
OH, AND DOESN'T THIS
LOOK LOVELY.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.286
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T GO
TO TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.706
- AH, I'LL JUST--
I'LL JUST SIT.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.625
I'LL JUST SIT.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.886
- IF YOU'RE DOING A PROJECT
WITH JOY,

18:15.969 --> 18:16.720
WHAT ABOUT ME?

18:16.804 --> 18:19.640
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.100
I'M USELESS WITH IDEAS.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.436
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO IT
WITH KT?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.938
- EXCUSE ME?

18:26.021 --> 18:27.397
- IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH HER,

18:27.481 --> 18:28.732
YOU CAN FIND OUT
WHAT SHE'S DOING WITH THAT KEY,

18:28.816 --> 18:31.735
AND IT MIGHT HELP ME BREAK THIS.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.696
- [sighs]
FINE.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.114
- THANK YOU.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.204
- YOU'RE SURE MARA'S OKAY
WITH US TEAMING UP?

18:42.287 --> 18:43.372
- LIKE MISS DENBY SAID,

18:43.455 --> 18:45.749
IT'S A BUSINESS STUDIES
COMPETITION.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.543
NOBODY GETS AHEAD IN BUSINESS
WITHOUT--

18:47.626 --> 18:49.294
- OH, WITHOUT BUSINESS ACUMEN:

18:49.378 --> 18:50.671
BUY LOW, SELL HIGH.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.550
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S TOTALLY
AND UTTERLY RIGHT.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.176
- MM-HMM.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.678
- THAT, AND BEND EVERY RULE
THAT'S OUT THERE.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.887
- OKAY, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT MARA

18:58.971 --> 19:00.806
IS GONNA BEND AND SNAP YOU
IF SHE FINDS OUT.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.181
- ALFIE...

19:03.392 --> 19:06.478
DO YOU WANT TO BE
MY CREATIVE DIRECTOR OR NOT?

19:06.562 --> 19:07.896
- I'M A CREATIVE DIRECTOR?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.064
- YES, YOU ARE.
- [squeals]

19:09.147 --> 19:10.774
- NOW, COME ON,
WE NEED TO WORKSHOP.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.109
SPITBALL.
GIVE ME SOME SNACK IDEAS.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.403
- GO, GO, GO.
- UM--

19:14.486 --> 19:15.946
OOH, MEAT-FLAVORED LOLLIPOPS.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.072
- NICE.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.407
- UH, OOH.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.826
A STICK-ON FLAVORED MOUSTACHE
THAT YOU CAN LICK.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.411
- NICE, LIKE IT.
LIKE IT.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.745
- GLOW-IN-THE-DARK CHOCOLATE

19:23.829 --> 19:25.664
AND EXPLODING FRUIT

19:25.747 --> 19:26.582
AND MUSICAL SAUSAGES.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.833
- ALFIE--

19:27.916 --> 19:29.710
- WHAT'S A--
WHAT'S A MUSICAL SAUSAGE?

19:29.793 --> 19:32.504
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.505
- GET SNACKS.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.590
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.426
- SNACKS.
GREAT IDEA.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.302
GOOD.
PERFECT.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.596
- [sighs]

19:42.472 --> 19:43.098
- [clears throat]

19:43.182 --> 19:44.808
- OH, VICTOR, I'M SORRY.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.876
- SOME CHEESE?

20:10.959 --> 20:13.378
- UM, ACTUALLY, IT DOESN'T
REALLY AGREE WITH ME.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.591
OH, BUT, I SUPPOSE
I COULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.134
BUT IF MY EARS SWELL UP
LIKE BALLOONS,

20:19.217 --> 20:21.303
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TELL ME.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.272
- TRUDY, VICTOR'S OFFICE.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.440
I THINK THEY'RE ON A DATE.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.358
- VICTOR ON A DATE?

20:36.234 --> 20:36.985
[laughs]
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.571
- SO WHAT'S HE DOING?

20:39.655 --> 20:42.449
[dramatic music]

20:46.870 --> 20:49.498
- YOU KNOW, UM...

20:52.918 --> 20:54.378
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU, TRUDY.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.006
- REALLY?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.384
WHY'S THAT?

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
- COME, COME.

21:04.012 --> 21:08.684
LET US NOT PLAY GAMES.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.810
I THINK...

21:11.061 --> 21:12.312
WE BOTH KNOW...

21:12.396 --> 21:16.858
THAT A FEW DAYS AGO,
YOU FOUND SOMETHING...

21:16.942 --> 21:19.611
SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE
AND VALUE.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.574
THE PARCEL, TRUDY.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.702
THAT PARCEL.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.037
- VICTOR,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.790
I THOUGHT YOU INVITED ME HERE
BECAUSE YOU LIKE ME.

21:33.166 --> 21:33.750
SO LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT
SOME STUPID PARCEL.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.669
- IT IS NOT STU--

21:39.464 --> 21:39.548
DO YOU HAVE IT?

21:42.175 --> 21:44.553
DO YOU HAVE IT?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.429
- VICTOR...

21:46.805 --> 21:50.434
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.601
I THINK I'M GOING TO LEAVE NOW.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.897
- NO ONE IS GOING ANYWHERE.
