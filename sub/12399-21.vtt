29:34.564 --> 29:35.599

Trigger?

30:08.724 --> 30:11.761
You don't really think this is about
Maryam Hasan, do you?

30:11.935 --> 30:18.431
Nikita, my target is,
and always has been, you.

30:27.701 --> 30:33.913
So where is everybody? Think your guys
could get a shot off before I took you out?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.459
No guys. It'sjust you and me.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.496
Right. Unarmed?

30:38.670 --> 30:42.788
Oh, I fired my shot weeks ago.
It's just reaching you now.

-The chair.
-No.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.840
No, no. Your brain is fine.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.594
That was just theater.

30:53.101 --> 30:57.435
Like the car crash that led you to the chip,
which then led you to the private satellite...

30:57.606 --> 31:00.063
...where you intercepted
the scripted phone call...

31:00.233 --> 31:02.645
...that pointed you to Maryam Hasan.

31:04.654 --> 31:08.112
You planned an entire assassination
just to get me here?

31:08.283 --> 31:11.525
Well, the Group does want Maryam dead,
which may still happen...

31:11.703 --> 31:14.615
...depending on Michael
or whoever else you sent to New York.

31:14.790 --> 31:19.375
Tell me, did the Group have a problem
with me taking out Smith for you?

31:19.544 --> 31:23.787
He was supposed to drop his phone
in the alley for you to trace to Cobalt.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.878
But you got a little ahead of him,
didn't you? Oh, well.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.094
Dr. Tolcher, on the other hand,
he did have to die.

31:31.264 --> 31:35.598
I needed you to see firsthand
just how the nano-toxins kill...

31:35.769 --> 31:38.977
...so that you can carry out
your final mission with clarity.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.434
Final mission?

31:41.650 --> 31:43.481
You think you can control me with fear?

31:43.652 --> 31:46.439
Like I haven't been injected
with poisons before, Amanda?

31:46.655 --> 31:49.192
It doesn't have to be injected.

31:49.783 --> 31:54.447
See, the nano-toxins can just as easily
be embedded in carbon-fiber bone.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.040
For example, if one were to receive
an artificial limb.

32:12.305 --> 32:16.014
You didn't really think that hand was free,
did you?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.681
The day I struck an alliance
with the Group...

32:20.856 --> 32:23.723
...I told them to give Michael's hand back
with an asterisk.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.358
Like I said, I fired my shot weeks ago.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.987
There is a trigger, for Michael,
that's very close by.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.111
Touch me and Michael dies.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.696
Of course, you could have given
Michael the antidote...

32:39.875 --> 32:43.413
...but he's probably using
the one dose you have right now.

Michael will be provided with the antidote.

34:39.327 --> 34:43.161
I don't care, really. I'm apolitical.
But the Group needs her dead, publicly.

But do you wanna know the best part?
You can't even tell the man you love.

He would rather sacrifice himself than watch
his beloved commit such a horrible act.
