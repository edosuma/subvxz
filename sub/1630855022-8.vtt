WEBVTT

00:19.937 --> 00:21.188
I can't let you smash it.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.731
Who says I was gonna smash it?

00:23.941 --> 00:27.069
You are not in my mind.
You don't know what I was gonna do.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.030
And I could ask you,
what are you doing in the store

00:30.030 --> 00:32.698
- in the middle of the night?
- Okay. I was working.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.369
And then I didn't wanna go home,
so I was just hanging out.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.079
I decided to try the machine
one more time,

00:37.079 --> 00:39.206
but I accidentally put in
the wrong numbers for my Social

00:39.206 --> 00:41.625
and I got the same thing,
the same card again.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.710
So I put in the wrong numbers again,
different numbers,

00:43.710 --> 00:47.589
and I didn't put my fingerprints on it.
I put on my arm and my elbow and my face.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.133
And no matter what I did,
every time I got the same thing,

00:50.133 --> 00:53.178
which means it isn't even using
the things people think it's using.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.474
Which means this whole thing is more,
I don't wanna say magical, but, like--

00:57.474 --> 00:58.725
Are you high right now?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.562
Of course. Of course I am.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.022
But that doesn't mean it's not true.
You can see for yourself.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.512
Is that what you got before?

01:36.930 --> 01:37.973
It's what I am.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.894
I thought you got "Dancer."
You're a ghost?

01:41.894 --> 01:43.478
I might as well be.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.398
I'm practically invisible in this town
these days.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.233
And you are pretty scary.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.322
Well, if you wanna trade,
I'd actually love to be invisible.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.241
- Well, you're invisible to me, dear.
- Thanks. High praise.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.119
I mean I won't tell Mr. Johnson
you were here.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.457
Thanks.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.544
And I won't tell him
you were gonna smash the machine,

02:08.169 --> 02:10.964
especially now that we know
about the fingerprints and Socials.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.049
Forget all that.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.384
People who believe
will continue to believe,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.471
and the people who don't
will just take this as proof it's a scam.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.765
You start telling people
that machine doesn't work

02:19.765 --> 02:20.891
the way they think it does,

02:22.059 --> 02:25.896
it's only gonna create more of a divide
and put you at the center of it.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.317
Now, what if Mr. Johnson asks
about that broken glass?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.487
I'll tell him a ghost did it.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.534
Seriously, you say anything,
and I will beat your ass.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.702
Good afternoon.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.370
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.206
I just took a quick break
from all of my gallivanting

03:26.206 --> 03:28.250
so that I could come and tell you
to go to hell.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.419
Yeah. You've been talking to Trina,

03:30.419 --> 03:35.966
telling her that I've been canoodling
with bachelors and playing princess,

03:35.966 --> 03:39.261
as if last night and everything
that I've been working so hard towards

03:39.261 --> 03:42.514
has something to do with me.
Trying to get attention or something.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.226
Okay.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.729
But I did not ask for that, okay?

03:48.729 --> 03:52.566
I do not want that because I am not you.
So you can think what you want,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.360
but I'm not gonna let you lie about me
to my daughter

03:55.360 --> 03:59.281
the same way that you have lied
about Martha to me.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.910
Yes. Did you really think
that we would never talk?

04:02.910 --> 04:05.704
You told me
that Martha didn't wanna have kids.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.582
You told me
that Martha did not want to have me.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.753
You had me feeling, this entire time,
like this has all been my fault.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.046
Have you had lunch?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.673
I'm sorry, what? What?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.845
- Please don't change the subject.
- I'm not.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.224
I'd like to take you to lunch
so we can talk.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.351
Properly.

04:29.394 --> 04:34.191
Yeah. Treat me to lunch.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.657
You do realize that I made this, right?

04:42.241 --> 04:44.201
I'd rather have an antler shoved up my ass

04:44.201 --> 04:47.496
than to pick another deer
made out of sticks.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.463
- Dad?
- Oh, no. Trina.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.217
Hold on. I am taking my whistler potential
to a whole new level.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.065
- I think Mom's having an affair.
- What?

05:15.065 --> 05:17.526
I caught Mom and Giorgio together
on the gondola last night,

05:17.526 --> 05:19.903
holding hands and looking shady as fuck.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.613
That's--

05:22.114 --> 05:24.783
Trina, I've seen Giorgio
take your mom's hands

05:24.783 --> 05:26.577
and kiss them in front of me.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.912
- It's nothing new.
- And you're okay with that?

05:28.912 --> 05:31.498
I'm not okay with it.
Of course I'm not okay with it.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.250
So then what are you gonna do about it?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.712
- Well-- I'm--
- I smashed that fucker's sign,

05:36.712 --> 05:38.463
and he didn't even do anything to me.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.509
Well, maybe I'll--

05:43.677 --> 05:46.096
maybe I'll smash in something
more than a sign.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.055
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:47.055 --> 05:50.475
- Yeah!
- Maybe I'll smash in his fucking face.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.562
- Yeah!
- Or maybe he has another sign I can smash.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.566
Either way, I'm not gonna stay down here
and take his shit anymore.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.027
- No.
- You think I'm gonna take his shit?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.361
It does seem like you're here

06:01.361 --> 06:03.113
- playing the fucking theremin.
- Not anymore--

06:03.614 --> 06:05.699
- No, you're not!
- I'm not gonna take it. No.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.743
'Cause your dad doesn't take
anybody's shit!

06:07.743 --> 06:10.120
- Can you just turn that thing off?
- It's tricky!

06:10.621 --> 06:13.874
You render it useless
when you take it off a flat surface.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.615
Come out here, Giorgio!
We have man business.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.117
I'm coming in!

06:52.454 --> 06:54.081
Giorgio, show yourself!

06:56.500 --> 06:58.544
Good. Hey!

07:01.713 --> 07:03.966
Are you ready for your comeuppance,
you slick prick?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.644
Giorgio, where are you?

07:20.858 --> 07:22.276
Welcome to Giorgio's.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.486
Giorgio.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.738
D?

07:27.823 --> 07:30.200
I never wanted you to see me like this, D.

07:30.200 --> 07:35.581
I never wanted you to look at me
with anything less than unadulterated awe.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.707
Unadultera--

07:37.583 --> 07:40.544
- You're the adulterator, you dipshit.
- It's true.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.963
I made a move on your girl, D.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.551
But she rejected me,
and I get it, you know? I do.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.929
Why pay for a slice of Giorgio pepperoni

07:50.929 --> 07:53.974
when you've got the world's greatest pie
at home?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.143
More like a hearty Irish stew, but yeah.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.438
Anyway, it's all good.
I'm just gonna be alone forever,

08:00.105 --> 08:01.481
and that's A-okay with--

08:06.320 --> 08:07.821
No.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.407
No, don't say that.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.994
I'm just too much
of an <i>idiota</i> to find love.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.247
Even the <i>idiotas</i> deserve love.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.584
No, I'm just a big,
bald, stupid little baby.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.922
Giorgio, you have
many attractive qualities.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.799
- Name five.
- Five? Holy shit.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.384
Yeah, five.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.179
You have a lovely big house.

08:34.056 --> 08:38.684
Okay, but that's not about me though.
Make it about me specifically.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.982
You've got such robust chest hair.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.653
- Thank you.
- You've got great taste in women.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.655
Obviously.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.490
And what a lovely skull you have.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.741
Gotta count for something.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.576
Two more.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.954
Two fucking more. Wow.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.705
- That's a lot more, isn't it?
- You see?

08:59.331 --> 09:02.209
You see, D? You can't even think
of five things that easily, man.

09:02.209 --> 09:06.129
I got nothing to be proud of, D.
I'm a fraud.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.341
I sold all my stuff,
all my cool sports stuff,

09:09.341 --> 09:12.302
including my Rangers goalie mask. And why?

09:13.220 --> 09:16.139
Why? To impress an outstanding woman?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.350
Like, do you have any idea how this feels?

09:18.851 --> 09:20.978
To do everything that you can
for a person,

09:20.978 --> 09:24.356
and yet she still doesn't love you
the way that you wanna be loved?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.614
Giorgio, I don't know
how to help you with that...

09:34.575 --> 09:36.577
but I could help you get your mask back.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.957
<i>Maro</i>. You're such a good friend, D.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.168
That's all right.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.921
Let's get your hair on, shall we?
That would cheer you up, wouldn't it?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.715
Yeah.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.592
Head down.

09:52.759 --> 09:57.264
- And pop it on.
- That's nice.

09:59.892 --> 10:00.851
Pretty boy.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.192
Do you remember the first time
we came in here together?

10:08.192 --> 10:09.610
Sadly, I do not.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.236
Now, you were about ten or 11.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.741
And that was all offices,
and this was Shanghai House.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.911
And there was a koi pond here,
where the canal is.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.873
- Remember? After the tornado?
- I don't remember a tornado.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.833
There was no tornado.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.127
Everyone panicked,
boarded up their windows,

10:27.127 --> 10:32.174
cleaned Johnson's out of supplies,
and it missed us by about 50 miles.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.177
You were so disappointed.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.597
Standing out there on the lawn,
staring up at the sky,

10:38.597 --> 10:43.644
waiting for something exciting to happen,
and all you got was a drizzle.

10:44.686 --> 10:49.900
So, I brought you here
for some chicken balls and MSG.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.403
You said you wanted to talk,
so does this story have a point maybe?

10:53.403 --> 10:57.241
My point is you were bored living here.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.661
You've always been bored and wanting more.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.664
When we lived in New York
and I was dancing,

11:03.664 --> 11:05.457
Martha couldn't understand that.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.709
She wanted a quiet life.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.380
She wanted to move here,
live closer to her family.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.675
And I didn't want to lose her, so we did.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.680
I gave up my career
because that's what you do

11:19.680 --> 11:20.848
when you love somebody.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.309
You bury parts of yourself
to keep them happy.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.438
But I was damn fucking bored, Cass.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.110
So I ran for office,
and Martha didn't like that either.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.321
And I'm not blaming her,
but I needed that.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.491
I needed something for myself.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.159
Okay.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.246
But you lied to me. Yes.

11:44.246 --> 11:48.208
You told me that you and Martha broke up
because she didn't want kids.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.751
She didn't want kids,

11:49.751 --> 11:52.671
which is why you may have noticed
she doesn't have any kids.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.256
But I did.

11:55.799 --> 12:01.763
I wanted you, which is why I chose
to have you at 17 years old.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.474
With no help from your dad,

12:04.474 --> 12:07.102
or from my parents
who kicked me out of the house

12:07.102 --> 12:08.687
and made me raise you on my own,

12:08.687 --> 12:12.149
which I was damn well happy to do
because I was a very good mother.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.151
And sweet fucking hell!

12:15.068 --> 12:17.362
Can't you see
we're having a conversation here?

12:17.362 --> 12:20.616
If you don't shut that thing up,
I will dance all over your face.

12:24.870 --> 12:25.871
Nice, Mom.

12:26.455 --> 12:30.792
I don't expect you to take my side.
You think I'm the enemy. It's fine.

12:33.128 --> 12:36.215
I just wish it didn't always have to be
a competition between us.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.386
So do I.

12:48.477 --> 12:52.856
That being said though,
I bet I kick your ass on that there game.

12:56.944 --> 13:01.156
I'm actually surprised these people
would spend money on a goalie mask.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.367
There's a lot they could've been doing
to their property.

13:03.367 --> 13:07.246
I mean, like, not to judge, but come on.
The lawn edging?

13:07.829 --> 13:10.874
- If they're so good at math--
- Hey, Giorgio, you think you have it bad?

13:10.874 --> 13:11.792
Check it out.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.587
"Sole Survivor."
What kind of potential is that?

13:15.587 --> 13:18.090
- It's the worst kind of potential.
- What the f--

13:18.090 --> 13:21.301
Hey there, friend. You the mathematician?

13:21.885 --> 13:24.513
Nah, man. I'm Urie, the sole survivor.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.350
But I don't know what I'm gonna survive,
so I've been living in the garden shed

13:28.350 --> 13:29.476
to protect my family.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.520
- What a lovely idea.
- Smart.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.440
- You guys wanna have tea with me?
- What a delightful offer, Urie.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.318
I'll give you the mask back for free,
if you come inside and have tea with me.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.655
It's really Giorgio's mask,

13:41.655 --> 13:44.825
- and it looks like a two-person shed.
- Let's have some tea, D.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.827
- Fuck a duck.
- Let's go, D.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.787
- What kinda tea you got in there, Urie?
- Chamomile.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.581
Chamomile. Hell, yeah.

13:50.581 --> 13:53.125
- Chamomile, love it.
- Now it's a party.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.209
Yeah.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.395
Yes!

14:13.395 --> 14:16.815
- In your face.
- Wow.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.026
I'm sorry,
who was the professional dancer?

14:19.651 --> 14:21.778
That's right.
Hi, I'm the professional dancer.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.780
- Yep.
- Okay, ma'am.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.490
- Yeah, you're causing a scene.
- Yes.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.534
- Oh, come on!
- You good?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.411
Your Grizzy is faking an injury.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.954
I am not faking.

14:30.954 --> 14:35.209
And it's not 'cause of that stupid thing.
It's 'cause of Pat and Farid's wedding.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.837
Okay, so why didn't you
just say something?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.130
Why try to play this game--

14:40.130 --> 14:42.508
I didn't get Dancer
for my potential, girls.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.387
And it won't be long before people
wanna see my card.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.306
That's all people care about now.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.683
And once they realize I've been lying...

14:53.602 --> 14:55.187
they'll never vote for me again.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.523
What are you talking about?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.374
Does Jacob have any more
of those blank cards?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.217
Just so you know,
this isn't exactly halfway between

15:25.217 --> 15:27.010
our houses as the crow flies.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.013
"As the crow flies"?
You're such a freaking dork.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.224
I'm doing you the favor.
I feel like you should be coming to me.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.643
- I'm not allowed in your house.
- Yeah, how convenient.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.982
Here.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.490
- Thanks for doing this.
- No worries.

15:52.202 --> 15:55.581
Of course, yes,
this concludes our transaction,

15:55.581 --> 15:58.333
so I guess I'll be on my way.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.294
Me too, as well.

16:04.715 --> 16:07.801
Or we could just stand here forever
in this random spot.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.804
It's not random.
It's equidistant between our houses, so...

16:10.804 --> 16:12.097
It actually isn't.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.226
But I am very happy to be here with you.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.438
Because you know what's not working?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.398
Not being together.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.277
No, that's not working at all.

16:25.277 --> 16:28.655
That is definitely not
making anything better.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.034
I just like you so much still.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.415
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.791
Yeah.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.586
<i>My biggest nightmare
is losing someone I love.</i>

16:42.586 --> 16:44.963
I don't want my wife around me,
if something bad's gonna happen.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.424
Okay, but this is no way to live, Urie.

16:47.424 --> 16:51.595
I mean, your wife is stuck in the house
doing fractions by herself.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.763
It doesn't add up.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.014
Think about it logically.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.769
If a meteor was to hit your house,
if you're really a sole survivor,

16:58.769 --> 17:03.232
then you'd be fine out here in your shed,
but your wife would be--

17:04.316 --> 17:06.527
She would be smashed by a space rock.

17:07.611 --> 17:11.281
I understand that with this,
but not with this.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.992
Every time I step outside,
I feel like I'm gonna vomit.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.203
Man, I know.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.790
I would throw up before big games
when I was playing for the Rangers

17:19.790 --> 17:21.916
in that very helmet right there.

17:21.916 --> 17:26.839
I put so much pressure on myself
because I was living in fear too.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.217
I felt like I had to be
this hockey superstar

17:30.217 --> 17:32.928
just because I had
so much God-given talent, you know?

17:32.928 --> 17:34.888
But the truth is, Urie-- the truth is,

17:34.888 --> 17:36.932
now I know
I should have just followed my heart.

17:36.932 --> 17:40.477
Flown to Italy,
so it could be me with Cass, instead of D.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.564
But I want you to know,
you would have been my best man.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.065
What? Okay. Let--

17:45.566 --> 17:50.737
I wasn't even in Italy with Cass.
I was working at a ski resort.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.699
Really? I didn't know that, D.

17:53.699 --> 17:54.908
Yeah, that was--

17:55.492 --> 17:58.120
Wow, that was actually the last time
that Cass and I were apart.

17:58.871 --> 18:01.373
That was, like, 20 years ago, Big D.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.542
You haven't been on your own in 20 years?

18:04.418 --> 18:08.755
I mean, I'm-- I can do some things alone.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.426
I go to the movies on my own.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.970
Why? Why do you go
to the movies on your own?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.847
I guess, in a way, I am...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.434
a bit afraid too.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.105
Afraid of finding out what would happen
if I didn't have Cass.

18:26.565 --> 18:31.028
I spend so much time thinking about
what she wants from me,

18:31.028 --> 18:33.447
I don't even know what I want from myself.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.949
It's like we're all trying
to control these things

18:35.949 --> 18:37.618
that can't be controlled, right?

18:37.618 --> 18:41.121
Instead of embracing the uncertainty.

18:41.121 --> 18:45.042
Yeah. I mean, look at us,
a bunch of best friend scaredy-cats,

18:45.542 --> 18:46.668
sitting here sipping tea.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.003
What are we doing?

18:48.003 --> 18:50.214
I'm gonna start going back outside,
living my life.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.382
- Yeah!
- Proud of you, bro.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.343
You guys wanna hang out tonight?

18:55.385 --> 18:57.930
- I would love to...
- Me too.

18:57.930 --> 19:04.686
...but I have previously committed
to going to a magic show.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.854
That sounds fake.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.942
It does. But, no. The magic is real.

19:17.574 --> 19:18.951
- Wow.
- I know.

19:18.951 --> 19:21.328
I'm surprised I found a parking spot.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.998
This is incredible, Izzy. I can't believe
how many people showed.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.043
Well, like I told them,
if you turn out to be a real magician,

19:28.043 --> 19:30.629
maybe they'll turn out to be
whatever it says on their cards.

19:30.629 --> 19:31.547
No pressure.

19:36.510 --> 19:37.719
Okay, so.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.721
Speaking of cards...

19:40.597 --> 19:43.141
don't say I never do anything for you.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.311
But you can say, "thank you."

19:47.020 --> 19:50.232
Or even "thanks."
Or "Hey, Cass, you're so kind."

19:50.232 --> 19:53.735
You think you're so kind? Watch this.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.572
Martha! Over here.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.909
- Is it true? Do you really have it?
- I really have it, Martha.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.205
- One permit for one moat.
- Finally.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.999
Rose is gonna be very happy,

20:06.999 --> 20:09.209
especially since
she's digging as we speak.

20:12.588 --> 20:18.719
The word "magic" first appeared
in the late 14th century

20:18.719 --> 20:23.390
to describe the art
of influencing or predicting events,

20:23.390 --> 20:27.895
and producing marvels
using hidden natural forces.

20:27.895 --> 20:32.524
Tonight you will witness the marvels

20:32.524 --> 20:36.945
of The Great Morphini!

20:51.376 --> 20:53.754
Oh, yeah, I fucking love magic. Let's go.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.014
That is not my card.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.810
Well, Father, are you sure you know
what your card is?

21:13.524 --> 21:15.108
Pick a card, sir.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.906
Memorize it, then replace it in the deck.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.119
I want you to close your eyes

21:26.119 --> 21:29.623
and relax to the sound of the metronome.

21:35.712 --> 21:39.132
Now, take yourself back
to a memory of a place.

21:39.132 --> 21:43.303
A real place. A peaceful place.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.680
Do you have it?

21:45.764 --> 21:47.558
- Yep.
- Where are you?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.142
I'm skiing.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.978
Please describe it.

21:52.521 --> 21:53.522
It's snowy.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.983
More descriptive, please.

21:55.983 --> 21:59.403
I need you to really put yourself there.

21:59.403 --> 22:05.200
Okay. Yeah. It's-- I'm skiing. It's snowy.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.036
I'm maybe 20 years old.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.834
And I'm alone.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.965
You see, I've taken
the wrong path on this--

22:19.965 --> 22:22.176
Or the wrong hill,
or whatever you call that.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.846
I'm supposed to be on the Beginner,
but I'm on the Black Diamond.

22:28.765 --> 22:34.897
And so I start going real fast,
'cause it's basically like this.

22:34.897 --> 22:40.694
And I am hurtling so quickly down
the face of this mountain.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.989
And I don't know what's gonna happen,

22:43.989 --> 22:46.700
but it's--
God, it feels like, I'm honestly

22:46.700 --> 22:49.578
like I'm gonna die.

22:51.455 --> 22:55.626
But I also feel very alive.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.338
Eyes closed, please.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.341
Where are you? Where is this mountain?

23:02.341 --> 23:05.093
It's in Canada. British Columbia.

23:05.093 --> 23:09.056
- Where? Be specific.
- This place called Whistler.

23:09.056 --> 23:10.766
And what was your card?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.144
- "Teacher/Whistler."
- No.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.689
Your card. That you picked from the deck.

23:19.274 --> 23:21.902
- Four of hearts.
- Check your pocket.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.575
The seven of spades.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.914
Maybe that was Father Reuben's card.

23:44.508 --> 23:48.595
And now, for my final trick!
"The Disappearing Woman."

23:48.595 --> 23:49.805
Cassandra Hubbard.

23:49.805 --> 23:54.393
When I reopen the doors to this coffin,
you will be gone!

23:55.602 --> 23:58.188
Please welcome my beautiful assistant...

24:02.860 --> 24:04.987
who will twirl the coffin around

24:04.987 --> 24:09.074
just to show you
there is nothing out of the ordinary.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.576
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

24:10.576 --> 24:12.244
- Hold your breath.
- Okay.

24:24.548 --> 24:27.801
Assistant, please open the coffin!

24:42.357 --> 24:44.109
The Great Morphini thanks you all.

24:44.109 --> 24:47.613
And thanks to our brave volunteers.

24:49.615 --> 24:52.826
Well, actually, we're not quite done!

24:52.826 --> 24:54.578
I have an announcement to make.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.541
I'll be stepping down
as mayor of Deerfield.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.962
I can't in good conscience continue
when I've broken your trust

25:03.962 --> 25:08.425
by lying about my MORPHO card.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.427
Why did I lie?

25:11.512 --> 25:13.639
Because I saw the writing on the wall.

25:14.223 --> 25:16.934
Because I saw the people of this town
placing greater trust

25:16.934 --> 25:19.811
in the prognostications of this machine

25:19.811 --> 25:22.439
than in their hobbled old mayor,

25:22.439 --> 25:23.982
and I don't blame you.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.360
In fact, I envy you.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.530
You believe in this machine
without questioning where it came from,

25:29.530 --> 25:33.700
or even Mr. Johnson,
our "master illusionist,"

25:33.700 --> 25:37.955
when he claims he wasn't there
when it magically appeared in his store.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.040
You don't have the coldhearted skepticism

25:40.040 --> 25:43.126
to ask about security tapes
or any kind of proof.

25:43.126 --> 25:46.713
Izzy, you know my cameras
weren't hooked up.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.340
- Why--
- That's right.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.384
But you did say Jacob was there.

25:50.384 --> 25:53.595
And luckily Jacob knows
all kinds of things about the machine.

25:53.595 --> 25:58.016
He was telling me that the fingerprints
and the Socials are all a scam.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.184
Is that what you said?

25:59.184 --> 26:01.436
No, wait, okay,
that's not what I was trying to--

26:01.436 --> 26:03.689
And Jacob can get blank cards
from the machine,

26:03.689 --> 26:05.482
since he so kindly provided me with one.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.901
Okay, I didn't give it to you.
I gave it to Trina.

26:09.236 --> 26:12.155
I mean, I knew it was for you.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.824
I didn't directly hand it to you, but I--

26:13.824 --> 26:15.409
It's not your fault, Jacob.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.579
I don't want anyone pointing fingers
at Jacob or Cass.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.747
Why would anyone blame Cass?

26:21.456 --> 26:23.083
For making the fake card.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.626
Oh, fuck.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.461
I never would have dragged Cass into this,

26:26.461 --> 26:28.130
except she's the only one
with the equipment

26:28.130 --> 26:31.300
to make convincing fakes, see?

26:34.428 --> 26:38.265
What are you trying to say?
I only made you one fake card.

26:38.974 --> 26:41.685
Don't gasp! She just told you that.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.770
Cass, I'm defending you, honey.

26:44.396 --> 26:47.816
Now, I can assure everyone here
that Cass hasn't made any more of these,

26:47.816 --> 26:49.526
and I for one believe her card,

26:49.526 --> 26:52.362
which happens to say she's royalty,
is real.

26:53.488 --> 26:56.283
So I won't have any one of you questioning
the Potential Fund

26:56.283 --> 26:59.786
or any other profits she may have incurred
from MORPHO-related merchandise.

26:59.786 --> 27:03.749
After all, Cass isn't the only one
making money off of this thing.

27:03.749 --> 27:08.045
I know Martha and Rose quadrupled business
since the arrival of the MORPHO,

27:08.045 --> 27:12.257
with people like Coach Eagleson
inspired to have affairs there.

27:13.383 --> 27:14.760
She's even put in a moat.

27:15.636 --> 27:16.720
Let's be real, people.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.014
If Cass were making any other fake cards,

27:19.014 --> 27:22.017
she certainly would have made a better one
for her own husband.

27:22.017 --> 27:26.021
She would've given him something
more like, I don't know, Superstar.

27:27.022 --> 27:29.191
All right. Izzy, that's enough.

27:29.191 --> 27:31.860
It is. It's enough, people.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.529
Can't you see this was simply

27:33.529 --> 27:36.365
an act of sacrifice
from a daughter for her mother,

27:36.365 --> 27:38.492
so that I could pretend
I once had potential,

27:38.492 --> 27:40.077
when in reality, I was--

27:40.077 --> 27:41.537
How'd you put it, Cass?

27:43.080 --> 27:45.207
"A glorified backup dancer,

27:45.207 --> 27:47.209
whose life's greatest achievement was

27:47.209 --> 27:51.588
playing Swing Number Three
in a shitty Broadway musical."

27:57.177 --> 28:00.389
Okay, do not listen to this woman.

28:00.389 --> 28:02.891
She lies about everything.

28:02.891 --> 28:05.561
She just wants things
to go back to the way they were,

28:05.561 --> 28:08.146
so that she can have power again. But--

28:08.146 --> 28:11.733
But we can't do that. We can't go back.
We can't. I'm sorry.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.318
No, it's the machine.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.572
The MORPHO machine
means something, doesn't it?

28:16.572 --> 28:18.240
I mean, I can see that now.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.826
I don't know what it means,
but it means something. So...

28:21.451 --> 28:24.079
While we all figure it out,
we cannot allow Izzy--

28:26.540 --> 28:28.166
to distract us-- Shit.
