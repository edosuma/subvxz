00:19.353 --> 00:22.440
("Stranger" by Goldfrapp plays)

01:53.197 --> 01:56.158
Lecturer: A man suffocated
his baby daughter

01:56.283 --> 01:58.285
and put her in a bag outside
Houston station.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.913
Ordinarily, this would've been
a death penalty case,

02:01.080 --> 02:03.958
but the killer made it
to Mexico,

02:04.125 --> 02:06.460
and now faces life
without parole.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.670
So, what does that teach us?

02:09.380 --> 02:12.925
It teaches us that no law
or ordinance

02:13.092 --> 02:15.136
is mightier than understanding.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.849
Know the rule of law,
and you can bend it.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.685
Understand its workings,

02:22.977 --> 02:26.147
and you can turn
first degree murder...

02:27.439 --> 02:29.191
into second degree murder.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.153
Second degree into manslaughter.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.701
Hey, ho, Harper! Harper, buddy!
Wait up, man!

02:38.868 --> 02:40.703
I got the baddest story
for you, dude.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.330
I was at the Depot this weekend
with the Chinaman,

02:43.497 --> 02:44.790
and I dropped liquid acid.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.500
Oh, yeah? How did that pan out?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.294
Terrible. Not good at all.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.921
Trip lasted 18 hours,
and then when I came to,

02:51.088 --> 02:52.131
my hair turned white.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.507
Yeah. It's white.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.384
Paul: (whispers)
Here's the thing, though,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.178
I don't remember being scared
or anything.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.388
Don't get me wrong,
it was intense but it was fun.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.640
So I go see the doctor,
ask him what he thinks about it.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.101
He says that it might not even
be related to the acid at all,

03:04.268 --> 03:05.352
that it could be hormonal.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.188
If my pituitary gland is fucked,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.023
starts kicking out loads
of estrogen,

03:09.190 --> 03:10.983
I can grow tits or turn gay
or something.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.194
I mean, what's worse,
being straight guy with tits,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.237
or waking up and all of a sudden
you crave dicks?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.573
Worse than that, you crave dicks
and your hair starts turning grey.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.074
I'll look like a gay skunk.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.744
Well, now, what's your problem?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.245
My mom's in a coma.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.539
Oh, fuck.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.084
Harper, dude, man.
I'm sorry, bro.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.212
Of course she's in a coma.
What the fuck am I?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.380
Am I the worst fucking friend
or the worst fucking friend?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.965
It's all right.
Just forget about it.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.759
- Bullshit, man. I can't.
- (car lock chirps)

03:36.884 --> 03:38.928
It's unforgivable.
I've been so focused on my own shit,

03:39.053 --> 03:40.971
my hair turning different
colors. I should've made time.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.890
No, it's all right, man.
You were busy.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.225
Hey.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.393
Harper, buddy, what is this?

03:46.644 --> 03:48.854
What are you doing to me here,
you putting the guilts on me?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.022
Huh?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.816
Come on, man,
you know I love your mom.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.151
I just forgot, that's all.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.611
Yeah, man. I know.

03:56.487 --> 03:57.488
I know.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.323
See you later.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.033
- (engine starts up)
- All right, buddy.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.743
See you later.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.125
(heart monitor beeps)

04:20.928 --> 04:23.347
Nurse: (over P.A.)
<i>Paging Dr. Holmer to Neurology.</i>

04:24.848 --> 04:26.934
<i>Paging Dr. Holmer to Neurology.</i>

04:34.233 --> 04:37.569
"One flew east, one flew west,

04:38.362 --> 04:39.989
one flew over
the cuckoo's nest."

04:42.700 --> 04:44.493
(heart monitor beeps)

05:06.140 --> 05:08.642
- (indistinct chatter)
- (sirens wail over TV)

05:08.809 --> 05:10.769
Man: (over TV) <i>Their quest
for the American dream</i>

05:10.936 --> 05:12.646
<i>can become a nightmare.</i>

05:13.230 --> 05:14.356
(tires screeching)

05:14.523 --> 05:18.110
<i>And even though this man ran far
and fast enough to get away...</i>

05:18.277 --> 05:20.696
Man 2: (over TV) <i>Going into
a very heavily wooded area.</i>

05:20.863 --> 05:23.032
Man: (over TV) <i>...he's starting
his new life in America</i>

05:23.198 --> 05:24.742
<i>as a fugitive.</i>

05:26.535 --> 05:27.536
<i>Golden Colorado.</i>

05:27.703 --> 05:29.163
Can I get some...

05:29.705 --> 05:30.956
(speech continues over TV)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.375
Man: (in bar)
He starts getting physical.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.044
Now, you see my Cherry...

05:35.961 --> 05:38.505
she's got a dollar sign where
most other girls got a heart.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.632
And this John,
he picks up on it.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.677
He says, "You like money,
don't you, you fucking whore?"

05:44.178 --> 05:46.513
She says,
"I like money and cock,

05:46.680 --> 05:49.183
and from where I'm sitting,
you don't got neither."

05:49.350 --> 05:51.352
- (laughing)
- Man 2: She said that?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.479
- (laughing)
- Man 2: So what did he do?

05:54.063 --> 05:57.816
Pulls a knife,
cuts her right on her cheek.

05:57.983 --> 05:58.984
Right there.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.198
Motherfucker, it's gonna cost me
a fortune.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.909
So anyway, Cherry starts
going crazy, as you can imagine.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.161
I can hear her screaming
from the hallway.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.830
She's screaming like Fred Krueger's
got his finger up her ass.

06:11.997 --> 06:12.998
(laughter)

06:13.165 --> 06:14.583
I come around
to see what the fuck!

06:14.750 --> 06:17.419
Cherry's pulled a gun.
She's standing there.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.296
She got a Beretta
pointed at his head.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.464
She's shaking.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.883
I tried to talk her 'round,
but, well...

06:23.050 --> 06:24.593
- (gunshots)
- Bam, bam, bam.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.432
Guess who had to clean up
the fucking mess?

06:30.599 --> 06:31.892
- Man 2: Holy shit.
- Mm-hm.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.229
Who the fuck is this guy?

06:35.562 --> 06:37.773
Watch out.
Get the fuck outta here.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.609
Didn't your mother tell you
it's rude

06:40.776 --> 06:43.153
to listen in
on other people's talk?

06:44.863 --> 06:46.949
- Not recently.
- What did you say?

06:47.116 --> 06:48.700
My mother's not doing so well,

06:48.867 --> 06:51.662
so she hasn't really been honing
my social skills recently.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.038
But what I think you're saying

06:53.205 --> 06:55.040
is that maybe
she shouldn't have to.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.043
You're running your mouth at me.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.003
Bartender: Johnny, come on, man.
He's drunk.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.797
He's a grown-up.
He knows what he said.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.966
Go home, buddy. It's late, okay?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.384
We don't want
any trouble tonight.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.345
Oh, it's not late.
It's not even ten o'clock yet.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.557
And whilst I appreciate your concern,
tomorrow morning,

07:11.765 --> 07:14.435
when I wake up
and look myself in the mirror,

07:14.601 --> 07:17.271
I'd rather see
a face full of bruises...

07:18.981 --> 07:20.315
than a face full of shame.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.943
(chuckles)

07:24.528 --> 07:28.574
And I'm prepared to go and buy
all your friends over there a drink.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.701
As an apology.

07:31.452 --> 07:34.204
Beyond that, go fuck yourselves.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.081
Let it go, Johnny.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.542
You can buy me a drink.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.003
I'll have a bottle of Scotch,
but we drink it together.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.923
I'm not really in a social mood.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.341
I'm not asking.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.553
Either we drink together, or we
go round and round right here.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.889
- Come on, Johnny.
- Shut the fuck up, fat man!

07:52.598 --> 07:53.640
(scoffs)

07:54.475 --> 07:56.768
- Are you laughing at me?
- (giggles)

07:57.895 --> 07:59.021
He's laughing at you.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.315
(giggles)

08:04.860 --> 08:07.112
- Follow me.
- Where we going?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.490
What, you scared?

08:10.491 --> 08:11.575
Are you scared of me?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.036
If I was gonna kill you,
I'd do it already.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.996
Trust me, you'll like it.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.790
You like chocolate sundaes?

08:19.374 --> 08:21.376
- Yeah. Where we going?
- You like girls?

08:21.919 --> 08:25.839
♪ (dance music plays) ♪

08:40.729 --> 08:42.856
- I'll take that.
- These aren't for you, Johnny.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.107
Yes, they are.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.120
(cell phone chimes)

09:02.167 --> 09:03.544
(sighs)

09:24.273 --> 09:27.192
Johnny: So, uh...
What you wanna be?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.444
What, when I grow up?

09:29.611 --> 09:31.989
Yeah, what you wanna be
when you grow up?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.866
- A criminal lawyer.
- Defense, I hope.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.493
Yeah, defense.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.996
What happens if you get
someone off who's guilty

09:39.162 --> 09:41.039
and then they go out
and play ball again?

09:41.665 --> 09:44.459
Just blame the prosecution
for not building a solid case.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.920
I mean, people have a right
to a good defense.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.589
Rich people, you mean.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.090
All people.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.050
Two days a week
I'm working for free.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.344
What, so you're a crusader?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.805
Look, I don't wear a cape,
but...

09:57.180 --> 09:59.224
I do find it very hard
to walk away from injustice.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.852
You be sure to give me your
number when you graduate.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.312
(chuckles) Yeah.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.567
What about you? Do you have
an area of expertise?

10:09.735 --> 10:11.236
- You need something doing?
- No.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.779
- Of course not. I just--
- What?

10:12.946 --> 10:13.947
- You know...
- What?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.951
I just like to hear
the other side.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.453
No, no, no.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.122
Your face.
You was thinking something.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.624
Nah, I wasn't really.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.375
Speak.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.380
I don't know. My--

10:31.715 --> 10:33.842
My step dad's a fucking asshole,
and...

10:34.801 --> 10:35.802
And?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.598
And sometimes I think it'd be
something if someone were to...

10:40.474 --> 10:42.559
ruffle his feathers a little.
You catch my drift?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.061
No, I don't catch your drift.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.355
"Ruffle his feathers"?
What, is he a bird?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.065
No, I mean... You know.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.025
Teach him a lesson.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.110
Yeah. What, science, math, what?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.862
Come on, man,
you know what I'm saying.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.948
I don't know what you're saying!
Teach him a lesson, I mean...

10:58.450 --> 11:01.328
You know, some guys I know,
that means kill him.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.829
That what you mean?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.206
No, of course not. I just...

11:04.873 --> 11:06.500
I mean beat him up a little
maybe.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.127
You gonna beat on somebody,
you gotta have a cause.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.714
No, no, no. No more drinking.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.424
Finish your story.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.718
(sighing)

11:17.636 --> 11:20.138
All right, so three months ago,
my mom gets in a car crash.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.015
She's driving,
he's in the passenger seat.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.308
They're both drunk.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.021
The car comes off the road,
they hit a tree, all right?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.399
And she's been in a coma
ever since.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.067
And you blame him for it?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.152
I blame him

11:34.319 --> 11:36.738
because he's visited her
once in the hospital

11:36.905 --> 11:37.906
in three months.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.033
And while she's in there
fighting for her life,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.160
he's going off to Vegas
and banging some...

11:42.494 --> 11:44.996
some cocktail waitress
named Rosy Hills.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.248
Probably not much older than me.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.793
(chuckles) Your old man's got
a taste for teen pussy.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.842
My mom got a terrible set
of results tonight.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.011
And if she gets more tomorrow,
then...

12:01.471 --> 12:03.056
she's gonna have
her machine...

12:05.851 --> 12:08.228
Anyway, he knows this.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.231
But tomorrow he's gonna go on
some so-called business trip

12:11.398 --> 12:12.733
to go see his whore in Vegas.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.568
Now...

12:15.444 --> 12:17.070
if that's the way
his mind's working,

12:17.738 --> 12:19.531
if that's what little regard
he has for her,

12:20.115 --> 12:21.116
then who's to say--

12:21.283 --> 12:23.535
Who's to say he didn't
have a hand in her death?

12:24.327 --> 12:25.412
Right.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.707
(drink pouring)

12:31.084 --> 12:32.544
Let me ask you something.

12:33.503 --> 12:37.758
If you could stop time,
cut yourself in half,

12:38.133 --> 12:39.926
and one side of you goes off,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.636
he kills this pussy hound.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.805
The other side,
he stays at home,

12:44.473 --> 12:46.016
don't know nothing about it.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.769
When it's over, the two sides,
they don't speak--

12:48.935 --> 12:51.229
Shit, they don't even know
what the other one's done.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.398
You live your life
with clean hands.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.317
Would you do it?

12:58.528 --> 12:59.529
Yes.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.699
That sort of thing
can be had, brother.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.581
How much?

13:09.748 --> 13:12.292
I mean, you know,
hypothetically speaking,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.044
how much would something
like that cost?

13:14.211 --> 13:15.587
Hypo-pathetically speaking,

13:16.546 --> 13:17.756
20 grand.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.091
We drive to Vegas,
clip this jock.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.802
He ends up
in the sand somewhere--

13:21.968 --> 13:22.969
Woman: Hey, boys.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.722
- What's going on?
- Fuck off, Cherry.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.600
No, she can stay. It's fine.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.310
No, she can't stay.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.187
Go on. Go.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.114
Where were we?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.367
(birds chirping)

13:47.285 --> 13:49.704
(water sprinkler pumping)

14:10.559 --> 14:12.477
(cell phone ringing)

14:20.485 --> 14:21.528
Hello?

14:21.862 --> 14:23.280
Operator: <i>Is that Harper James?</i>

14:23.405 --> 14:24.281
Yes.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.116
<i>Dr. Ulmer would like
to speak with you.</i>

14:26.408 --> 14:27.409
Okay.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.702
<i>I'll just connect you.</i>

14:29.160 --> 14:30.996
♪ (hold music plays) ♪

14:35.333 --> 14:36.793
(doorbell chimes)

14:38.920 --> 14:40.088
(hangs up)

15:12.662 --> 15:13.747
You all set?

15:14.873 --> 15:15.874
Hm?

15:17.167 --> 15:18.376
Your old man?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.669
Shit.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.922
No. No, no, no.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.299
God, no. I was drunk last night.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.467
Fuck that.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.510
I forgot.
I should've called you.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.679
Twenty grand,
three of us drive to Vegas,

15:29.846 --> 15:31.264
you spot him, I shoot.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.850
No.
No, that's not gonna happen.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.311
Oh. Yes, it is.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.814
Look, I said a lot of stuff
last night that I didn't mean.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.024
- You meant it.
- No.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.692
You're just scared, that's all.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.110
No, I was upset last night

15:44.277 --> 15:46.071
I was upset
because of my mother.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.198
- And we're going to Vegas.
- No, we're really not.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.991
Shut your fucking mouth,
all right?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.535
Your nerves are fucking
with you, that's all this is.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.412
Hey, Harper! Everything okay?

15:55.372 --> 15:57.540
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.125
Okay, buddy.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.669
Look, man.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.671
I'm sorry, okay?
But I made a mistake.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.964
I...

16:04.422 --> 16:05.548
I apologize.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.717
I don't want
your fucking apologies.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.052
What I want for you to do

16:09.177 --> 16:11.638
is put your money
where your big fucking mouth is.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.610
I'm sorry. I can't.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.696
- We're going to Vegas.
- I'm sorry.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.031
Don't fucking walk away from me!

16:34.119 --> 16:36.746
(breathes heavily)

17:09.945 --> 17:12.656
All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.867
Let's got to Vegas.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.681
You made the right choice.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.142
If you hadn't have come, you'd
be sitting at home right now,

17:39.350 --> 17:41.436
thinking about what
could've been instead what is.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.147
(retches)

17:49.903 --> 17:51.237
Johnny: <i>I got a policy.</i>

17:52.530 --> 17:54.365
<i>Don't regret
the things you do,</i>

17:55.075 --> 17:56.367
<i>just the things you don't.</i>

17:57.869 --> 17:59.037
Ain't that right, Cherry?

18:35.907 --> 18:37.117
You going somewhere?

18:42.831 --> 18:44.582
You know what today is, right?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.335
The hospital won't know anything
till 11:00.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.713
- Yeah, did you go up there?
- I called them.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.465
(scoffs) Yeah.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.384
'Cause a visit's
out of the question, right?

18:54.551 --> 18:57.262
Because I have business
to attend to.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.472
Yeah, business.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.642
What's that supposed to mean?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.727
Hm. Oh...

19:06.020 --> 19:08.064
I don't know. You tell me.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.400
The business that will
keep this roof above your head,

19:10.567 --> 19:13.111
if, God forbid, something bad
does happen to your mother.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.196
Something bad already
has happened to my mother.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.115
She met you.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.283
(scoffs)

19:26.541 --> 19:27.917
You just got in, right?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.670
Yeah, I just got in. So what?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.466
So I'm guessing
you're still drunk.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.469
Yeah, I'm drunk.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.225
Then maybe you should take a
shower and cool off,

19:45.059 --> 19:47.187
before you say something
you regret.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.373
(engine revving)

20:48.539 --> 20:50.333
Hey, would you mind
if I made a phone call?

20:50.541 --> 20:51.584
To who?

20:51.793 --> 20:53.544
I need to call the hospital
about my mom.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.922
- So, go ahead.
- I left my phone.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.549
No, I should use a public phone.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.301
If I use yours and something
goes wrong,

21:00.468 --> 21:01.719
they'll be able to connect us.

21:01.886 --> 21:02.887
Not this phone.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.057
This phone's registered to some
shitbag geriatric in Malibu.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.101
I cover my tracks, man.
Told you that.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.187
I cover other peoples, too.
Ain't that right, Cherry?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.649
So come on,
what are you waiting for?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.362
- It's kind of private.
- I ain't gonna listen.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.410
- It can wait.
- (mouths) Fuck.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.871
You all right?

21:29.789 --> 21:30.790
Cherry?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.709
What?
What is that supposed to mean?

21:32.875 --> 21:33.876
I'm good, Johnny.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.097
Al: <i>She was facing straight ahead,
so I couldn't see her eyes.</i>

21:46.264 --> 21:48.683
<i>But she was young,
not more than 24.</i>

21:49.642 --> 21:51.811
<i>Man, she looked as if
she'd just been thrown off</i>

21:51.978 --> 21:53.646
<i>the crumbiest freight train
in the world.</i>

21:54.731 --> 21:57.650
<i>Yet, in spite of this,
I got the impression of beauty.</i>

21:58.109 --> 22:00.445
<i>Not the beauty of a movie
actress, mind you,</i>

22:00.611 --> 22:02.947
<i>or the beauty you dream about
when you're with your wife,</i>

22:03.114 --> 22:04.157
<i>but a natural beauty.</i>

22:04.991 --> 22:07.076
<i>A beauty that's almost homely
because it's so real.</i>

22:09.162 --> 22:11.205
<i>Then suddenly she turned
to face me.</i>

22:11.372 --> 22:12.957
Vera: <i>How far
did you say we were going?</i>

22:13.291 --> 22:15.168
Los Angeles.
Where you coming from?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.336
<i>Oh, back there.</i>

22:16.502 --> 22:17.712
<i>- Needles?
- No.</i>

22:18.421 --> 22:19.797
<i>Oh, sure, Phoenix.</i>

22:19.964 --> 22:21.841
<i>You look just like</i>
a <i>Phoenix girl.</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:23.843
<i>Are the girls from Phoenix
that bad?</i>

22:24.135 --> 22:25.928
Al: <i>The girl
must've been pretty tired</i>

22:26.095 --> 22:27.138
<i>because she fell asleep</i>

22:27.305 --> 22:29.140
<i>not 20 minutes after
she stepped into the car.</i>

22:29.849 --> 22:33.895
<i>She lay sprawled out with her head
resting against the car door.</i>

22:34.604 --> 22:36.064
<i>I didn't like
that part of it much,</i>

22:36.230 --> 22:37.273
<i>but I didn't wake her up.</i>

22:38.900 --> 22:40.818
<i>It wasn't that this girl
still worried me.</i>

22:41.069 --> 22:42.820
<i>I'd gotten over
that funny feeling I had</i>

22:42.987 --> 22:43.988
<i>when she looked at me.</i>

22:44.155 --> 22:46.074
<i>- Which I put down as just my--</i>
- (TV turns of)

22:48.743 --> 22:50.578
Vincent: <i>The cab 's booked
for just after 11:00.</i>

22:52.789 --> 22:54.624
<i>I love you more than anything
in the whole world.</i>

22:56.125 --> 22:57.377
<i>You are my world.</i>

23:01.464 --> 23:03.424
<i>Harper thinks
he's got something on me.</i>

23:03.716 --> 23:05.968
<i>I don't know what he thinks
he knows, but...</i>

23:06.844 --> 23:08.179
<i>you don't need to worry
about him.</i>

23:08.721 --> 23:09.722
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

23:11.682 --> 23:15.103
You know, I imagine us
together real soon.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.106
And we're gonna be so happy.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.192
And all this misery
will be behind us.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.200
Johnny:
So, where's your old man at?

23:29.700 --> 23:30.743
Harper: He's at the house.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.161
He's still back there?

23:32.328 --> 23:33.996
Yeah, yeah.
His flight's not until later.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.915
He was about to leave when you
guys showed up.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.542
Where's he staying at when he
gets in?

23:37.708 --> 23:38.709
I got an address.

23:38.876 --> 23:39.919
You know, a job like this,

23:40.086 --> 23:41.504
I'm gonna need the money
up front.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.381
Yeah, that's no problem.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.008
Oh!

23:46.175 --> 23:48.469
Well, fuck me, she's alive!

23:48.594 --> 23:50.012
It's nice to have you back
with us.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.180
Fuck off, Johnny.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.224
- What was that?
- You heard me.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.145
Don't hit me.
Don't you fucking hit me!

23:57.311 --> 23:58.438
Fucking..

23:58.604 --> 24:00.731
- Stop, stop, stop!
- You say something?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.985
Huh?

24:04.152 --> 24:05.778
You don't have to be physical.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.448
Like that? What,
are you her guardian angel,

24:08.573 --> 24:09.782
or do you wanna fuck her?

24:09.949 --> 24:10.950
No, of course not.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.827
- What, you think she's ugly?
- No.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.162
She's your girl.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.913
Yeah well,
what if she wasn't my girl?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.582
- Johnny!
- Would you fuck her then?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.333
No, come on,
what if she wasn't my girl?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.878
- Would you fuck her then?
- But she is your girl.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.005
Yeah, but, motherfucker,
what if she wasn't?

24:24.172 --> 24:26.007
Come on, it's a straight
fucking question!

24:26.174 --> 24:27.633
I want a straight
fucking answer!

24:27.925 --> 24:30.094
Everything has its price,
you little shit!

24:30.303 --> 24:32.054
Would you fuck her, yes or no?

24:32.430 --> 24:33.598
Yes or no?

24:33.764 --> 24:34.765
Huh?

24:34.932 --> 24:36.267
If she wasn't your girl,
then yes.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.768
Yes, I think she's very pretty.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.359
Yeah, then you're very lucky,
because she's not my girl.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.445
She's a fucking whore.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.364
Anti-social fucking whore

24:50.531 --> 24:52.366
who needs to cheer
her country ass up.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.494
Recognize who her
fucking friends are!

25:08.216 --> 25:09.675
(engine revving)

25:28.444 --> 25:29.445
Miss.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.656
Where's the shithole
in this shithole?

25:39.956 --> 25:40.998
Hey. Are you okay?

25:41.749 --> 25:42.917
What are you doing?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.211
- What do you mean?
- Why are you here?

25:46.295 --> 25:48.548
- You know why I'm here.
- I know what Johnny told me.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.967
- Yeah.
- You're not the killing type.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.844
Is there a killing type?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.388
Yeah, and it ain't you.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.439
(snorts, sighs)

26:07.149 --> 26:08.568
Cherry:
Listen, you want some advice?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.695
Get on that bus
and go wherever it's going

26:10.861 --> 26:12.363
and have your boring,
miserable life

26:12.530 --> 26:14.282
because I can guarantee
it'll be a whole lot better

26:14.407 --> 26:15.575
than being in debt to Johnny.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.577
I'm not gonna be in debt
because I'm gonna pay him.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.037
What do you think happens when
Johnny's running low on cash?

26:20.204 --> 26:22.164
"Hey, Harper, hey,
my car broke down

26:22.331 --> 26:23.749
I'm gonna need
a little extra cash."

26:23.916 --> 26:24.917
Well, then I'll say no.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.169
And he'll politely remind you
one phone call from him

26:27.336 --> 26:28.713
you're going straight to jail.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.089
Yeah, and so is he.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.259
No, no, 'cause you see Johnny
can call 20 maniacs in prison,

26:33.426 --> 26:35.094
all doing life without parole,

26:35.261 --> 26:36.470
who, for a case of cigarettes,

26:36.637 --> 26:39.223
will say they killed your step dad,
and you paid them to do it.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.601
He's an expert
on shit like that.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.480
So that's why you're with him,
because he's blackmailing you?

26:46.647 --> 26:48.441
I heard him talking
about your face.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.527
He said you shot someone.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.165
- (moaning)
- Yeah.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.333
<i>Fuck me good!</i>

27:06.125 --> 27:07.126
(woman moans)

27:07.376 --> 27:11.172
(cell phone ringing)

27:13.090 --> 27:14.091
Hello?

27:14.258 --> 27:15.593
Harper:
Hey, man, what you doing?

27:15.760 --> 27:16.761
Masturbating.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.805
<i>Hey, man, I got the fear about
this whole hormone thing,</i>

27:19.972 --> 27:22.141
so I've been surfing the
gay sites, see if I've turned.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.560
They got some crazy shit
on here, man.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.980
Terrifying stuff. Gay gangers,
fucking orgies, muscle Marys.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.775
<i>They even got this genre called
"The straight guys first time".</i>

27:30.941 --> 27:32.193
<i>I tried that. Nothing.</i>

27:32.360 --> 27:34.779
Toys, twinks, studs,
not a twinge.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.614
And then I put the straight porn
back on...

27:36.781 --> 27:37.865
Boom! I'm back, baby!

27:37.990 --> 27:39.367
I got more wood
than a lumberjack.

27:39.659 --> 27:40.826
How's your mom?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.954
The same. Thanks for asking.
Listen, um...

27:44.997 --> 27:47.625
- I need that favor.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.752
<i>All right,
so I need to get some weed.</i>

27:49.919 --> 27:51.087
Wait, you wanna buy weed?

27:51.253 --> 27:53.839
<i>Yeah, I wanna buy a lot of weed,
but you can't ask me why.</i>

27:54.048 --> 27:55.299
- Why?
- Paul.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.677
<i>- Is it for your mom?</i>
- What? No.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.011
Medicinal?

27:59.220 --> 28:00.596
No, my mom's in a fucking coma!

28:00.763 --> 28:02.264
How is she supposed
to smoke weed?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.809
You're right, dude.
That was dumb.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.687
So, how much you need?

28:07.853 --> 28:09.689
<i>I need enough
that if you were caught with it</i>

28:09.855 --> 28:11.982
<i>there's no way it could be
construed as personal use.</i>

28:13.275 --> 28:14.318
What's going on?

28:14.610 --> 28:16.153
I told you not to ask.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.322
Come on, man,
I broke up mid-whack for this.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.532
Break your vow of silence.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.409
Vincent's going to Vegas later,

28:21.575 --> 28:23.786
and he's going to run into some
problems at the airport.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.788
Yeah, I'm into that.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.081
<i>All right. Cool, man.</i>

28:27.248 --> 28:29.041
All right. Thanks. Bye.

28:34.505 --> 28:38.175
(shower running)

29:15.588 --> 29:17.214
(opens drawer)

29:33.355 --> 29:34.857
Hey, what can I get you?

29:35.024 --> 29:37.902
Two beers,
a sparkling water for the lady

29:38.068 --> 29:39.653
and get the boy a milkshake.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.572
Waitress: And what flavor?

29:41.739 --> 29:42.740
Banana.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.039
Have we met before?

29:50.915 --> 29:52.666
I don't think so.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.752
You were in my class
at Fairpoint.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.087
I'm Claire Wiseman, remember?

29:57.713 --> 30:00.132
Ah, yeah. I remember.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.509
How are you?

30:01.759 --> 30:04.345
I'm good.
Wow, it's so good to see you.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.222
What have you been doing
these days?

30:06.388 --> 30:07.848
Oh, this and that.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.433
What happened to your face?

30:11.060 --> 30:12.186
I was in a car crash.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.562
Waitress: I'm sorry.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.272
You're still as pretty as ever,
though.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.440
Thank you.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.317
Why don't you tell
your donut rubber friend

30:18.484 --> 30:20.402
- what you do for a living?
- Come on, man.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.864
She's a singer.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.950
She's got a great voice.
Ain't that right?

30:26.450 --> 30:27.952
You know, come to think of it,

30:28.118 --> 30:29.662
I remember you singing
at school.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.248
You were good.
Where do you sing at now?

30:32.414 --> 30:34.458
- I sometimes sing at--
- Vegas.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.377
Good for you!
Is that where you're headed?

30:36.544 --> 30:37.545
Yes, we are.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.755
- Wow, I wish I could come with.
- Well, you can't.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.675
So why don't you jog
that cream pie ass along,

30:42.842 --> 30:44.093
put our order in?

30:45.719 --> 30:48.806
I guess I will.
I'll catch you in a minute.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.977
You thought I was gonna tell her
you was a trick?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.728
- I'm not a trick.
- He don't care.

30:54.895 --> 30:55.896
I do.

31:06.907 --> 31:07.992
You're not a trick.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.207
Don't you gotta go make
that call?

31:17.501 --> 31:18.586
Yeah.

31:30.598 --> 31:31.891
You wanna keep this going?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.561
It's getting tiring, you know?

31:35.769 --> 31:37.897
You keep staring
in that rear view mirror,

31:38.063 --> 31:39.189
you're gonna crash.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.818
The fuck is wrong with you?

31:43.110 --> 31:44.528
I swear to God,

31:44.737 --> 31:47.239
you've been body-snatched
or something.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.574
Alien.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.161
What do you want from me?

31:52.328 --> 31:53.871
I warned you I was crazy,

31:54.038 --> 31:55.664
but you was all,
"Don't worry, baby,

31:55.831 --> 31:56.832
I like crazy."

31:59.752 --> 32:00.878
Where's that girl?

32:04.924 --> 32:06.634
That girl was 16 years old.

32:19.229 --> 32:22.316
Hi. Can I get Dr. Ulmer, please?
It's Harper James.

32:22.483 --> 32:23.943
<i>- I'll just connect you.</i>
- Thank you.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.780
Dr. Ulmer: <i>Harper.
I was just about to call you.</i>

32:27.947 --> 32:29.239
How are things?

32:29.990 --> 32:31.742
<i>I was hoping I can see you
in person.</i>

32:31.909 --> 32:33.077
Just tell me.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.081
<i>The second set of results
came back,</i>

32:38.290 --> 32:40.960
<i>and, I'm afraid to say,
there's no brain function.</i>

32:44.088 --> 32:45.798
<i>I really am very sorry.</i>

32:47.967 --> 32:49.593
<i>You have to take comfort
in the fact</i>

32:49.760 --> 32:51.762
<i>that you did everything
you could for her.</i>

32:52.304 --> 32:54.473
<i>You were by her side
the whole time.</i>

32:55.474 --> 32:57.810
<i>Some people never experience
that kind of love.</i>

32:59.103 --> 33:01.105
<i>As doctors,
we realize pretty soon</i>

33:01.271 --> 33:02.690
<i>that we can't save everyone,</i>

33:03.691 --> 33:05.401
<i>but we have to try.</i>

33:07.027 --> 33:09.154
<i>You couldn't have done
much more for her.</i>

33:12.658 --> 33:15.035
<i>We don't have to make any
decisions right now, just...</i>

33:15.536 --> 33:17.579
<i>I think you should just come
by the office</i>

33:17.746 --> 33:18.831
<i>and we could have a talk.</i>

33:20.791 --> 33:22.710
<i>Harper? Are you there?</i>

33:26.213 --> 33:27.381
<i>Harper?</i>

33:31.093 --> 33:32.928
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.650
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Mikey, what can I get you?

33:47.359 --> 33:50.612
Make it
a cheese and mustard bagel,

33:51.321 --> 33:53.532
coffee, and give me some juice
with that.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.784
- Okay. You got it.
- How's Pete?

33:55.951 --> 33:57.995
Oh, the same, you know.
He asked about you.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.663
- Said you'd been sick?
- Yeah.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.082
I had that bug that was
going around, everybody had.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.251
You look better.
I'm gonna put your order in.

34:04.418 --> 34:05.502
Yeah, thanks.

34:13.177 --> 34:16.388
(indistinct speech
over police radio)

34:22.393 --> 34:24.063
Hey, do you think that cop's
all right?

34:24.353 --> 34:26.315
No, I think that
that cop's an asshole,

34:26.482 --> 34:28.525
but we didn't do nothing wrong,
so relax.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.779
We gotta make a detour.
We gotta go see Frank.

34:31.904 --> 34:32.737
Why?

34:32.862 --> 34:34.739
Because we can't go to Nevada
without seeing Frank.

34:34.907 --> 34:35.824
Yes, we can.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.909
We pass through Nevada without
seeing Frank,

34:38.159 --> 34:39.953
Frank finds out,
there'll be drama.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.498
- We don't need no drama.
- Who's this Frank guy?

34:42.664 --> 34:44.625
- He's a friend of ours.
- (chuckles) Yeah, right.

34:44.792 --> 34:45.958
Frank is...

34:48.587 --> 34:49.630
Put it this way,

34:49.797 --> 34:51.547
last time we was going
to Nevada,

34:51.715 --> 34:53.175
Cherry was sitting on
a kilo of blow.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.219
She had it tucked away,
if you know what I mean.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.054
Most of it was in my bra.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.223
We were stopped what,
five times?

34:59.389 --> 35:00.557
At least five times.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.476
But each time they didn't have
a cause for a search,

35:02.643 --> 35:03.727
so they just had to let us go.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.480
But on the fifth time,
they bring out this sniffer dog.

35:06.647 --> 35:07.731
This...
(imitates dog)

35:09.024 --> 35:10.984
I thought we was fucked
for sure,

35:11.151 --> 35:13.570
but that dog,
he just walked on past.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.448
I'm thinking, "Damn, Cherry must
have that shit packed tight."

35:16.657 --> 35:18.033
Anyway,

35:18.200 --> 35:21.286
we get to Frank's, and it turns
out we ain't smuggling coke.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.080
We're smuggling baking powder.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.000
The whole K is jack.
The spic dealer fucked us.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.211
We ain't sure whether
to laugh or cry.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.547
If it was flake,
we would've gotten 20 years.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.714
- Federal.
- Wait,

35:32.881 --> 35:34.591
So you didn't check it
before you bought it?

35:34.758 --> 35:36.718
It was Frank's guy.
I didn't have to.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.345
So, what happened?

35:38.846 --> 35:39.721
When?

35:39.888 --> 35:42.349
Wasn't this Frank guy angry
that you gave him fake drugs?

35:42.850 --> 35:44.476
Like I said,
Frank's a friend of mine.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.359
- Here's your check.
- I didn't ask for no check.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.282
Thank you.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.621
All right.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.874
What you're seeing here
is video evidence,

36:07.040 --> 36:09.418
proof, that Vincent Reed,
my mother's second husband,

36:09.585 --> 36:10.878
somehow managed to convince her

36:11.044 --> 36:12.337
to sign over control
of the house,

36:12.504 --> 36:14.339
in the event of her death
or incapacity.

36:15.299 --> 36:18.427
This in spite, on the date that
she allegedly signed, right here,

36:18.594 --> 36:19.928
she was in New York with me.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.847
Look, I have our
air tickets here.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.224
And here's a photo of the two
of us on the Brooklyn Bridge.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.809
- Vincent: Harper! Harper!
- Note the date.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.020
Shit.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.279
<i>Harper, get over here now!
Move your ass!</i>

36:39.448 --> 36:40.532
What?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.911
You get over here. What is this?

36:44.953 --> 36:46.788
- It's a knife.
- I know that, smartass!

36:46.955 --> 36:48.332
What's it doing
in my hand luggage?

36:48.498 --> 36:49.917
- I have no idea.
- You put it there.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.501
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know why.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.670
To make me look like shit
at the airport, probably.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.172
Oh, yeah.
That's right. I forgot.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.049
You're going on a business trip.

36:57.216 --> 36:59.468
A business trip to go survey
the Davis Casino extension.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.428
Except for the fact
that the Davis Casino

37:01.595 --> 37:03.889
- isn't having an extension.
- It's not an extension!

37:04.056 --> 37:05.724
We're developing
apartment blocks!

37:05.807 --> 37:07.267
You're a liar.
You're a fucking liar!

37:07.392 --> 37:09.186
Everything that's coming out of
your mouth is bullshit!

37:09.311 --> 37:10.479
All right, buddy.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.357
Why don't you tell me what it is
that you think you know?

37:14.775 --> 37:17.736
You forged my mother's signature
on her will, yeah.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.863
And you did a pretty good job
of it, Vince,

37:20.072 --> 37:22.699
except for the fact
that she was with me in New York

37:22.866 --> 37:24.576
on the date that she was
supposed to have signed!

37:24.660 --> 37:25.661
And guess what?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.663
That's not gonna hold up
in court, buddy.

37:30.499 --> 37:33.252
I... I forged her signature

37:33.418 --> 37:35.170
so that you would get your money

37:35.420 --> 37:38.048
without having to go through
five years of litigation,

37:38.173 --> 37:40.467
- if we get bad new today.
- So you did forge it.

37:40.634 --> 37:41.843
So what?

37:42.219 --> 37:43.929
Oh, but it was all for me,
right, Vince?

37:44.054 --> 37:45.138
In a way, yeah.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.600
Good. Are you fucking the
cocktail waitress for me, too?

37:49.601 --> 37:50.727
What are you talking about?

37:50.894 --> 37:53.814
I'm not stupid, Vince!
I know about Rosy Hills.

37:54.022 --> 37:58.235
Rosy Hills? (chuckles)
Yeah, yeah, you are right!

37:58.402 --> 38:00.153
I am fucking Rosy Hills

38:00.320 --> 38:02.364
while your mother lies dying
in a coma!

38:02.531 --> 38:03.740
But that's not even all.

38:03.865 --> 38:04.825
- No?
- No.

38:04.992 --> 38:07.703
I think you were driving the car
when the accident happened!

38:07.828 --> 38:09.162
You wanted her to die!

38:09.538 --> 38:10.831
How fucking dare you?

38:11.039 --> 38:11.790
Get--

38:12.249 --> 38:14.042
What the fuck is the matter
with you! Fuck!

38:14.293 --> 38:15.711
(grunting)

38:22.467 --> 38:24.469
(audio cuts out)

38:58.628 --> 39:00.422
- (knife slices)
- (gasps)

39:05.761 --> 39:07.054
(grunting)

39:11.641 --> 39:12.934
(grunting)

39:13.727 --> 39:15.228
(groaning)

39:16.480 --> 39:17.606
Harper.

39:32.662 --> 39:36.291
(siren wailing)

39:38.960 --> 39:41.546
(siren wailing)

39:45.092 --> 39:46.760
Let me do the talking.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.345
Wait, you're not gonna stop,
are you?

39:48.553 --> 39:50.472
We didn't do nothing wrong,
all right?

39:50.639 --> 39:52.349
Don't speak, you understand me?

39:52.516 --> 39:53.975
Don't say a fucking word.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.354
(siren wailing)

40:04.319 --> 40:05.570
(siren chirps)

40:06.988 --> 40:08.573
Fucking shit.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.743
Dispatch: (over radio)
<i>57, go ahead.</i>

40:11.910 --> 40:15.038
Control, Sierra Madre calling in here.
Officer Andrews.

40:15.622 --> 40:19.126
NV plates for a 1-2-3-1-9,
California plates.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.253
(car door opens)

40:31.221 --> 40:32.389
(snorts)

40:36.810 --> 40:38.228
Something wrong, Officer?

40:38.520 --> 40:39.980
My gut says "yeah".

40:40.772 --> 40:42.524
You ran out the restaurant.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.276
You forgot this on the table.

40:45.819 --> 40:46.820
Yeah?

40:47.404 --> 40:48.363
Yeah.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.199
You know, I have no idea why
she wrote that.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.618
She is a waitress.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.037
She might've thought
it was part of the service.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.205
Don't matter, though.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.374
You've been hawking me through
your pig blinkers

40:59.541 --> 41:00.917
since I walked into that place.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.254
The question is, why?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.214
Uniforms make me nervous.

41:06.423 --> 41:07.757
- Do they now?
- Yeah.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.968
I fought in Afghanistan,
got therapy.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.970
- You's a vet, huh?
- Mm-hm.

41:12.429 --> 41:13.763
Huh. Small world.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.891
I served, too, 2002.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.727
- Operation Anaconda.
- Your boys did a fine job.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.521
Why, thank you, sir.
What's the name of your mission?

41:21.688 --> 41:24.983
Oh, you know, we named it
Go Fuck Bin Laden.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.778
(laughing)

41:29.488 --> 41:30.489
Go...

41:31.490 --> 41:33.116
Go Fuck Bin Laden?

41:33.700 --> 41:36.620
Oh, man, I like that.
That's funny. That's funny.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.039
What's the real name
of your mission?

41:41.750 --> 41:43.502
You know, I can't recall.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.378
Uh-huh.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.552
Would you please step out
of the vehicle?

41:52.802 --> 41:53.803
(car door opens)

41:55.680 --> 41:56.932
Put your hands on the hood.

41:57.891 --> 42:00.644
- Come on, man.
- Put your hands on the hood!

42:02.562 --> 42:05.857
A soldier's mission
is scarred on his brain.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.444
You disrespectful piece of shit.

42:09.778 --> 42:11.279
You think you some kind of
war hero?

42:11.530 --> 42:13.114
Open your legs! Open your legs!

42:19.412 --> 42:20.580
Okay.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.207
Okay.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.918
What we have here?

42:25.877 --> 42:28.380
What's this, coke, meth, oxy?

42:28.672 --> 42:30.966
I know how you hillbilly boys
like that oxy.

42:31.550 --> 42:33.760
No, no, no.
That's crushed Viagra.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.972
I'll need a shitload of it later
if I'm to fuck your wife.

42:38.515 --> 42:40.183
- You fuck!
- (groaning)

42:40.433 --> 42:42.185
(grunting)

42:42.727 --> 42:45.730
You wanna laugh now?
You, get out of the car!

42:46.064 --> 42:49.067
Get out of the car right now!
Get out of the vehicle!

42:49.234 --> 42:51.278
Get out of the vehicle now!
Put your hands in the air!

42:51.444 --> 42:53.446
Come on, move, Sister Mary!
Get over here!

42:53.613 --> 42:55.156
- Yes, sir.
- Put your hands on the hood.

42:55.323 --> 42:56.324
Yes, sir.

42:57.867 --> 42:59.536
- Do I gotta cuff you?
- No, sir.

42:59.703 --> 43:00.453
Good.

43:01.580 --> 43:02.747
'Cause I only got cable ties,

43:02.914 --> 43:05.125
and I do not need another
police brutality charge.

43:05.292 --> 43:06.334
Yes, sir.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.169
Keep your eyes right here,
you hear me?

43:08.336 --> 43:10.338
Keep your eyes right here
and your hands on the hood!

43:10.505 --> 43:11.798
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.

43:14.175 --> 43:16.052
- Stop crying.
- Yes, sir.

43:19.598 --> 43:20.640
How are you doing, Miss?

43:20.807 --> 43:21.891
Oh, I'm all right.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.059
Yeah?

43:23.226 --> 43:25.520
Getting your friends arrested
don't bother you none, huh?

43:25.687 --> 43:27.814
They ain't technically
my friends, Officer.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.733
They hired me for the day.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.279
- You a hooker?
- I'm a dancer.

43:36.489 --> 43:38.950
Prostitution's legal in Nevada,
but this ain't Nevada.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.036
I ain't fucked them yet,
neither.

43:41.620 --> 43:42.912
Yeah, can't blame you.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.080
(Cherry chuckles)

43:44.247 --> 43:45.707
I need you come up
out of this car,

43:45.874 --> 43:47.709
give me a little tour around.
That all right?

43:47.917 --> 43:49.210
- Sure.
- All right.

43:52.756 --> 43:54.674
You can start by popping
the trunk, that all right?

43:54.883 --> 43:56.259
- Sure.
- All right.

43:56.676 --> 43:57.969
(car door closes)

44:03.850 --> 44:05.185
Keep your eyes on me!

44:05.435 --> 44:06.645
Yes, sir.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.946
- Jesus Christ.
- Drop the gun!

44:17.739 --> 44:19.616
You're making a mistake, ma'am!
Making a big mistake!

44:19.783 --> 44:21.493
You heard me, asshole,
drop the fucking gun!

44:21.618 --> 44:22.994
- Shoot the prick!
- No!

44:23.161 --> 44:24.663
- Kill him!
- Do not kill him!

44:24.829 --> 44:27.374
No, no, listen to him!
Don't kill me, ma'am! Please!

44:27.540 --> 44:30.210
- Drop the fucking gun!
- Okay! Right there, lady, all right?

44:30.335 --> 44:31.878
Please! I got a wife and kid!

44:32.045 --> 44:34.089
- I just wanna go home!
- Drop the keys for the handcuffs.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.299
Take the keys and go, all right?
Just take the keys.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.551
Right there. All right?

44:38.718 --> 44:40.637
Look, I got a wife and kids
at home.

44:40.804 --> 44:42.263
I just want to go home. Okay?

44:42.430 --> 44:44.516
(radio beeps)
(dispatch over radio)

44:44.683 --> 44:47.018
- Give me that fucking radio!
- (radio chirps)

44:47.352 --> 44:48.645
Here, you can have these.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.313
I just don't want any trouble.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.440
- Just put the gun away.
- Get in the trunk.

44:53.817 --> 44:55.568
No, I'm not getting
in that trunk.

44:55.735 --> 44:56.736
Get in the fucking trunk.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.281
(shouts)
Get in the fucking trunk!

45:09.624 --> 45:11.334
- Get in the trunk!
- Okay!

45:22.595 --> 45:24.806
(panting)

45:37.152 --> 45:38.153
Okay.

45:38.653 --> 45:40.947
Pull it together, Harper.
Come on.

45:41.114 --> 45:42.824
Keep it together.
Keep yourself together.

45:43.366 --> 45:45.785
(breathes heavily)

45:45.952 --> 45:47.620
You're not the kind of guy
who folds.

45:49.414 --> 45:50.665
This is not the time to panic.

45:57.547 --> 45:58.757
He killed her.

45:59.382 --> 46:00.383
He killed your mother.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.081
Mr. Parfitt: Hey, Harper!

47:14.749 --> 47:15.875
Everything okay?

47:16.042 --> 47:17.168
Uh: yeah!

47:17.752 --> 47:19.087
Mr. Parfitt:
Nice day for a swim.

47:19.254 --> 47:20.129
Yeah.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.508
Listen, I can clear those leaves
for you, if you like.

47:23.883 --> 47:25.343
You've enough to worry about.

47:25.510 --> 47:28.596
No. No...
I like the distraction.

47:29.472 --> 47:30.473
Okay.

48:19.731 --> 48:21.190
(sobs)

48:21.774 --> 48:23.651
(car engine starts up)

49:49.237 --> 49:50.446
Fuck.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.459
(tape unravels)

50:18.433 --> 50:20.893
(cell phone ringing)

50:30.695 --> 50:32.071
(cell phone chimes)

50:38.369 --> 50:40.663
Voicemail:
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

50:40.788 --> 50:41.622
(beeps)

50:41.748 --> 50:44.167
<i>Hey, Harper, it's Paul. I got
that little something for you.</i>

50:44.333 --> 50:45.626
<i>I'm on my way around.</i>

50:45.960 --> 50:47.420
No, no, no, no. Fuck!

50:47.587 --> 50:49.005
(line ringing)

50:51.090 --> 50:52.467
- (cell phone beeps)
- Hey, Paul.

50:52.633 --> 50:53.676
Hey, it's Harper.

50:53.843 --> 50:55.261
Listen, hey, whatever you do,

50:55.428 --> 50:57.513
you absolutely cannot
come over here right now.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.725
There's just been a...
Just don't come.

51:00.892 --> 51:02.143
Just don't come over.

51:02.310 --> 51:04.395
(doorbell chimes)

51:06.439 --> 51:07.440
Fuck.

51:21.162 --> 51:22.163
Fuck.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.135
- Hey, Paul--
- What's up, buddy?

51:36.385 --> 51:38.262
Wait, you can't go in there.

51:38.429 --> 51:39.430
Why?

51:39.597 --> 51:40.973
You just can't. Come here.

51:41.474 --> 51:42.600
What's going on?

51:43.643 --> 51:44.811
Uh...

51:45.103 --> 51:47.855
- My step dad's in there.
- Oh, shit. Okay.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.440
Do you still want the weed?

51:49.607 --> 51:52.318
Uh... Yeah, yeah. I'll take it.

51:52.485 --> 51:54.529
Okay, well there was
a slight problem with the weed.

51:54.695 --> 51:57.115
Do you remember the mine shafts
we visited when we were kids?

51:57.281 --> 51:59.075
Do you remember Reece
got lost for three days?

51:59.242 --> 52:01.828
They got this Tree of Love
music festival there now.

52:01.994 --> 52:04.455
Imagine if one of them stoners
gets lost in them tunnels, dude.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.874
They're not gonna find that
fool's body for a hundred years.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.921
But anyway, that's why
I couldn't get any weed.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.966
It's all right. It's all right.
I'll take whatever you have.

52:15.174 --> 52:16.175
Harper.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.511
I've been on a wild goose chase
all morning, man.

52:18.678 --> 52:19.679
At least hear me out.

52:19.846 --> 52:21.389
Do you wanna grab a coffee
or something?

52:21.556 --> 52:22.557
I... You know what?

52:22.723 --> 52:23.808
I can't, man.

52:23.975 --> 52:26.811
I just really gotta go see
my mom in a minute.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.020
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.523
Look, I couldn't get the weed,

52:30.690 --> 52:32.942
but do you remember that stuff
that turned my hair white?

52:34.068 --> 52:35.987
Boom. Liquid acid.

52:37.113 --> 52:38.322
Schedule One drug.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.991
They find that on him, man,

52:40.158 --> 52:41.450
they're gonna
throw his ass away.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.369
However, if you're feeling
compassionate,

52:43.536 --> 52:45.830
or just fancy some fun
of the twisted variety,

52:45.997 --> 52:47.498
put some of that
in his eye drops.

52:47.665 --> 52:49.375
He'll wind up in an institution.

52:49.959 --> 52:51.752
All right. Thanks.

52:54.672 --> 52:57.633
- You okay, man?
- I'm fine. Fine.

52:59.302 --> 53:00.553
Hey, buddy.

53:03.556 --> 53:05.600
Dude, you know I love you, man,
and your mom.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.102
When you go visit her
at the hospital,

53:08.227 --> 53:09.645
give her a big hug for me, okay?

53:10.730 --> 53:12.607
Hey, come here, buddy.
Come here.

53:15.026 --> 53:16.986
- It's gonna be okay, I promise.
- (sobs)

53:17.153 --> 53:19.530
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call you later, okay?

53:21.782 --> 53:23.367
All right. Thanks, man.

53:27.205 --> 53:28.206
(engine revving)

53:28.372 --> 53:29.790
Johnny:
<i>We're gonna have to kill him</i>

53:29.957 --> 53:31.292
<i>and dump his body somewhere.</i>

53:31.459 --> 53:33.169
Harper: <i>Kill a fucking cop!
Are you crazy?</i>

53:33.294 --> 53:35.087
What do you wanna do,
just let him go?

53:35.254 --> 53:37.173
- Well, we're not gonna kill him!
- (knocking from trunk)

53:37.423 --> 53:39.675
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.388
All right. All right.
I have something to admit.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.390
No, you have nothing to admit.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.309
Just trust Johnny.
He knows what he's doing.

53:48.476 --> 53:50.394
Admit? What the fuck
are you talking about?

53:51.229 --> 53:53.272
- Nothing.
- Say what you was gonna say.

53:56.234 --> 53:57.360
All right.

53:57.526 --> 53:58.569
I'm scared, okay?

53:58.736 --> 54:00.279
I admit that I'm scared.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.409
Feeling scared is normal,

54:05.576 --> 54:07.828
but don't be feeling bad
for no cop.

54:08.287 --> 54:11.582
You seen how he was acting up.
Some people deserve what they get.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.418
Well, there's gotta be
another way.

54:14.585 --> 54:17.421
- You don't have to kill him.
- Oh, I ain't gonna kill him.

54:17.713 --> 54:19.924
- You are.
- What?

54:20.091 --> 54:21.550
I gotta know which side
you're on.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.345
Now, I know that may seem tough,
but as you get older,

54:24.512 --> 54:27.265
you realize that life isn't
about the choice you make.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.474
It's the one you're given.

54:28.641 --> 54:31.143
You can't live in the past.
Ain't that right, Cherry?

54:31.769 --> 54:33.521
I said,
"Ain't that right, Cherry?"

54:33.688 --> 54:35.314
Yeah. That is right, Johnny.

54:35.481 --> 54:36.983
Yeah, that's right.

54:37.650 --> 54:40.319
So the choice I'm giving you is,
kill the cop,

54:40.444 --> 54:42.113
then go to the bank
and get my money,

54:42.321 --> 54:44.407
or go to the bank, get my money,

54:44.699 --> 54:47.076
and then, well,
I think you got it.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.038
So, what's it gonna be?

54:54.834 --> 54:57.753
Cashier: 20,000 in this
envelope, five in that one.

55:02.091 --> 55:03.259
Anything else, sir?

55:05.511 --> 55:07.346
Have you lived here in Barstow
your whole life?

55:07.513 --> 55:09.098
- Yes, I have.
- Yeah?

55:09.265 --> 55:10.474
Do you like it here?

55:10.641 --> 55:12.768
- Not really.
- Why is that?

55:13.102 --> 55:14.228
Boring as hell.

55:15.313 --> 55:17.523
Johnny: What was you talking
about when we was in the diner?

55:17.898 --> 55:18.983
Cherry: When?

55:19.358 --> 55:20.359
What do you mean, "When"?

55:20.526 --> 55:22.820
When you was in the diner
and I was in the head.

55:23.446 --> 55:24.613
Nothing.

55:24.780 --> 55:27.158
Your lips were moving.
Nothing was coming out.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.368
He asked if I was all right.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.330
Why?

55:32.496 --> 55:33.789
'Cause you hit me.

55:38.836 --> 55:39.837
What did you tell him?

55:41.047 --> 55:42.381
I told him I was fine.

55:42.548 --> 55:44.592
- What else?
- Nothing else.

55:46.469 --> 55:49.513
I was gone a while.
You must have said something.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.725
Nope.

55:56.771 --> 55:57.980
They only had five available.

55:58.147 --> 55:59.565
I'm giving you
the rest tonight in Vegas

55:59.690 --> 56:01.150
and I'll give you more
to buy the cop.

56:01.275 --> 56:02.526
Cop ain't for sale.

56:02.943 --> 56:04.403
You said everything
has its price.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.406
How much?

56:09.700 --> 56:11.327
If the cop lives,
I'll give you ten grand.

56:11.952 --> 56:13.120
I'm guessing you got a plan

56:13.371 --> 56:15.873
that don't involve me
spending a lifetime in prison.

56:16.665 --> 56:17.833
Yeah, I got a plan.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.460
Yeah?
You wanna tell me that plan?

56:19.627 --> 56:21.253
Yeah, there's a mine shaft
near here.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.630
Take me there, I'll show you.

56:23.714 --> 56:26.425
All right.
First we gotta go see Frank.

56:26.592 --> 56:27.885
(engine starts up)

56:52.326 --> 56:54.662
These guys find out
there's a cop in the trunk,

56:54.787 --> 56:57.415
they're gonna kill us all.
You make one fucking noise, pig,

56:57.581 --> 56:59.250
I'm gonna blast
your fucking head off.

57:05.131 --> 57:09.176
(vehicle approaching)

57:37.538 --> 57:38.539
Is he in?

57:38.706 --> 57:39.582
Yeah.

57:39.707 --> 57:41.041
What kind of mood?

57:41.625 --> 57:42.835
He's never in a good mood.

57:58.476 --> 58:01.562
Well, I got you all wrong,
didn't I?

58:03.856 --> 58:06.650
No. You got me just right.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.236
(footsteps approaching)

58:20.539 --> 58:21.457
Hi, Cherry.

58:21.624 --> 58:22.666
Hi, Frank.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.754
I had a dream about you
last night.

58:26.921 --> 58:28.047
- Really.
- Yeah.

58:29.381 --> 58:30.841
It's so strange
that you're here.

58:33.469 --> 58:34.470
Hey...

58:35.846 --> 58:37.806
You mind if I give you
my number?

58:39.517 --> 58:40.518
My card?

58:40.684 --> 58:41.685
- Sure.
- Yeah.

58:41.852 --> 58:42.853
Is that all right?

58:44.104 --> 58:45.272
Wait-- Wait a second.

58:47.483 --> 58:48.484
Pen.

58:53.906 --> 58:55.032
Call me, huh?

58:58.452 --> 59:00.287
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:01.455 --> 59:02.289
Mm.

59:18.013 --> 59:19.014
Frank: Ladies.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.186
Hey, hey!

59:26.730 --> 59:27.731
Hey, come here.

59:31.777 --> 59:33.279
Be awake
the next time I come in.

59:39.493 --> 59:40.327
Frank.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.495
What's going on?

59:42.037 --> 59:44.164
Cherry's sitting,
waiting in the car outside.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.041
You don't bring her in
to say hi?

59:46.584 --> 59:47.585
She's tired.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.003
- Tired?
- Yeah.

59:49.169 --> 59:50.588
We're all fucking tired.

59:52.381 --> 59:54.550
- Who's the boy?
- A friend.

59:54.717 --> 59:55.718
What kind of friend?

59:55.884 --> 59:57.261
Kind that picks up the tab.

59:57.428 --> 59:58.846
Now that's five grand.

59:59.013 --> 01:00:00.514
I'll have the rest for you
by tomorrow.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:01.849
Why not today?

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:04.268
I got something going on
down in Vegas.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:08.439
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.779
What did I say to you
the last time you were here?

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.698
You said don't come back
empty-handed!

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:20.534
Wrong! Lift your chin.
Stay still.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.829
- (pants) Frank, please!
- Lift your chin up!

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:29.376
Didn't break. It doesn't count
because it didn't break.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.420
- Frank, I'm gonna have your--
- Shut up!

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.214
You say one more word,

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.884
Ralph here'll put you in a box,
you understand?

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:39.345
(grunts)

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.512
Fuck!

01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:42.348
My shoulder.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.434
My shoulder.
I can't throw so hard anymore.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:47.978
It's your lucky day, huh?

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.155
The last time you were here...

01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:00.491
I said,

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:02.826
I would've preferred you have
come with nothing

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.286
than another excuse.

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.455
And what do you bring me?

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:13.671
I bought a kilogram
of baking powder from you...

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.631
and you're still breathing.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.550
Why is that?

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.678
Why?

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.054
Why? Come on, come on.
Speak!

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:23.472
I know you've been good to me--

01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:25.432
"Been good to me." Me-me-me.

01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:30.104
You're a cretin, you know that?

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.107
You know what a cretin is?

01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:37.403
A cretin's someone
who's brainless, childish,

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.446
lacks intelligence,

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.033
speaks nonsense that only
other cretins can understand.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.830
You're busting your ass
with these repayments, why?

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.791
Because you have feelings
for this girl.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:53.293
This girl that you treat
like a fucking whore.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.380
And me! Me!
I have feelings for her, too!

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:59.842
But it seems I'm the only man
in the whole fucking world

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.927
who can't nail
that piece of ass!

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:06.724
So...

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.268
I'm gonna make you the same
offer I made you last time.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.647
The girl stays here with me
and the debt is cleared.

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:15.816
You can even take
your five grand with you.

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:22.656
Cherry stays here,
and you can visit.

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:31.290
I can't do that.

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:32.875
Get your ass up.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:37.504
There's one thing...

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.175
that my success
is based on...

01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:43.844
and that's my word.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:46.805
That's all I have.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.768
Tomorrow...

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.646
when the sun rises
over those hills,

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:59.193
if I don't see 50 grand
sitting across my desk,

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.904
I'm gonna come,
I'm gonna find Cherry,

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.447
and I'm gonna sell her

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:06.450
to some bearded,
kneepad-wearing motherfucker

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.285
who will put her
in a tent somewhere

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.246
and use her as some kind of
hillbilly fuck mat!

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.709
Do I make myself
absolutely clear?

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:21.507
- Yeah!
- (whimpering)

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.094
Now get the fuck out of here.

01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:31.391
- Ralph?
- Yes, boss.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.811
Keep an eye on that degenerate.
Call our people in Vegas.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.647
I don't want that cretin
running loose.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.957
(telephone ringing)

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.590
Mom: (over answerphone)
<i>Hey, we're not in right now,</i>

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.758
<i>but leave a message
and we'll call you right back.</i>

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:47.968

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.431

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:43.941
Yes.

<i>Dr. Ulmer would like
to speak with you.</i>

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:47.611
Okay.

<i>I'll just connect you.</i>

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.329
(hangs up)

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:27.734
You're all set?

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:29.528
Hm?

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:32.114
Your old man.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.281
Shit.

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:36.451
No. No, no, no.
God, no. I was--

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.787
- I was drunk last night.
- Fuck that.

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:41.164
Harper:
No, I was upset last night.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.666
Upset because of my mother.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.085
- Johnny: We're going to Vegas.
- No, we're really not.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:46.878
Johnny: Shut your fucking mouth,
all right?

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:48.255
Your nerves are fucking
with you,

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.257
- that's all this is.
- Hey, Harper.

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:51.758
Everything okay?

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.844
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:55.846
Okay, buddy.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.642
I'm sorry,
but I made a mistake, okay?

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.104
- I apologize.
- I don't want fucking apologies,

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.399
What I want for you is to put your money
where big fucking mouth is.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:08.692
I'm sorry.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.278
Fucking walk away from me!

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:23.832
Paul: <i>Do you remember
the mine shafts</i>

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.125
<i>that we visited
when we were kids?</i>

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:26.835
<i>Remember Reece got lost
for three days?</i>

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:28.837
<i>They got this
music festival there now.</i>

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:31.423
<i>Imagine if one of them stoners
gets lost in them tunnels, dude.</i>

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.009
<i>They're not gonna find that
fool's body for a hundred years</i>

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.638
All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:43.101
Let's go to Vegas.
But let's take my dad's car.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:45.979
Why?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.401
Why not?

01:07:53.028 --> 01:07:53.987

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:56.615
Johnny: Get out of the way,
you fucking vegans!

01:07:56.782 --> 01:07:58.742
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.952
What are you twirling,
a fucking stick?

01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:02.662
(sounds horn)

01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:05.332
Harper: Okay, this is where the
Anderson Shaft, is right here.

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:11.379
Pull over there
by the mine shaft.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:27.854
What's the plan?

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.064
Pass me a bottle of water.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.153
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You ain't gonna just let this guy go.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.863
He's probably dead
from dehydration.

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:38.406
And if he's not,

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.826
this is liquid acid, all right?

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.245
He's gonna be in the grip
of some serious hallucinations

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.412
for the next 48 hours.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.372
He won't know fact from fiction
for a week,

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.416
let alone be a reliable witness
in court.

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:51.377
All right.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.631
But if you can't tame
this piggy, I will.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.323
Sir? Hello?

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.118
I think he's dead.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.786
(grunting, gasping)

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.662
- (cries out)
- Sir.

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:28.206
Sir! Sir!

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.542
Wait! Wait!
I'm trying to help you.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.587
Here, drink this! Drink this!
It's water! It's water!

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:45.932
Wait!

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.100
Hey, go that way.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.603
Towards the festival!

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:19.341
Let's go to Vegas.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:18.024
Welcome to the casino, sir.
Is there any baggage in the trunk?

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.526
No. Nothing.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:21.444
We ain't staying long.

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:23.697
No problem.

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.543
Two rooms. Big ones.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.712
And put us down
at the comp rate.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.422
I'm gonna need a credit card.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.844
- Can I get a name?
- Peters.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:47.554
Barney Peters.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:52.309
(typing)

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.522
Okay, Mr. Peters,
you're good to go.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.691
Thank you. Thanks.

01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:06.406
You go get my money,
then we find your old man.

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:09.284
And I got the keys, in case
you think about going anywhere.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.661
What are you doing?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.163
I'm gonna go to the room.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.790
Stay there.
I might need that ass.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.167
(elevator dings)

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.308
I'm gonna rent a car...

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.393
and I'm gonna drive away.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.312
And I'm gonna keep on driving.

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.774
And if you wanna come,
be outside the casino at 10:00.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:43.777
(elevator dings)

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.042
(casino games chiming)

01:13:18.228 --> 01:13:19.646
Can I get light and a bourbon?

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.739
I'm guessing you're a winner.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:31.908
In what regard?

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:34.661
In regard
to that stack of chips.

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:37.831
You think I gamble to win?

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.543
Then why?

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.296
Why do you think a boxer fights

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.340
when he's got more money
than he can ever spend?

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.592
'Cause he's stupid.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.760
(man chuckles)

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.263
He does it to feel alive.

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:57.976
He'd rather risk it all
than be dead here or here.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:00.645
To be really alive...

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.982
you gotta gamble more
than you can afford to lose.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:09.028
You just gotta know how much...
or what that thing is.

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.187
Can I get a prepaid phone?

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.971
Hello, police? This is
the valet at The Collinen.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:19.098
I was just taking a Mustang
down to the garage

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.643
and I accidentally
popped the trunk, and well...

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.103
there's something
you gotta see in here.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:26.606
All right. Thanks.

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:36.241
Would you like extra insurance?

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:37.492
Uh, no, thanks.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.287
Here you are.

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.958
Any vehicle from lot D.
Just show this at the gate.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.125
Thank you.

01:15:51.089 --> 01:15:52.215
(cell phone chimes)

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.138
(knocking on door)

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.354
- Going someplace?
- No.

01:16:50.982 --> 01:16:53.484
Hi, sweetie.
Come on in.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:23.598
Officer: Can I get an ID
on a blue Mustang?

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:47.914
Drive.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.254
Harper: <i>What happened?</i>

01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:57.090
Fucking asshole.

01:17:58.132 --> 01:17:59.509
He brought a guy to my room.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.762
Cops burst in,
arrested him for murder.

01:18:05.098 --> 01:18:06.265
How did you get out?

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.559
They thought I was a hooker.

01:18:19.946 --> 01:18:21.823
Johnny: Listen to me.
He's gonna kill her!

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:24.659
He's gonna kill--
He's gonna kill Cherry!

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:25.993
What are you talking about?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.121
Frank Malone! If I don't get
Frank the money...

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.288
Get inside!

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:30.998
...he's gonna kill Cherry.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.127
Please! Please!

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:36.838
You're allowed one phone call.
You want my advice?

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:38.506
Forget the girl
and call a lawyer.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.106
I'll go see if they got a room.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.741
I never killed the guy
who cut my face.

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.868
I mean, I shot him.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:09.662
Me and Johnny, we dope guys.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.207
I ain't proud of it,
but we bring guys back to the room,

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:16.252
guy falls asleep,
Johnny comes in, we rob him.

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:20.381
Except this time, the guy don't sleep
and Johnny don't show.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.510
This asshole. He hit's me.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.471
He's on top of me.

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:28.389
I'm fighting him,
screaming, crying...

01:19:28.556 --> 01:19:29.724
And Johnny don't show.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.227
This guy smashes a bottle
and says

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.772
it's either gonna be his cock
or the bottle inside of me.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:39.984
I try to run, he cuts my face,

01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.653
and I hear the sound of a gun,
and I'd shot him.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:47.492
Then Johnny shows up.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:51.454
That asshole would've lived,

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.372
but Johnny didn't drive him
to no hospital.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.999
He took him to a storm drain.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:00.713
What about you?

01:20:02.757 --> 01:20:03.800
Why'd you kill him?

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.771
(cell phone ringing)

01:20:29.534 --> 01:20:30.535
Johnny: <i>Cherry...</i>

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:35.456
<i>Frank's coming to get you.</i>

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:38.751
<i>I didn't wanna scare you.</i>

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.048
I just...

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:09.407
(exhaling)

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:11.492
Let's go.

01:21:31.262 --> 01:21:34.098
(distorted feedback)

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.115
(birds chirping)

01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.169
Ralph.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.338
Go get my Cherry.

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:18.225
Cherry: <i>Why didn't you
just call a lawyer?</i>

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.102
Harper: <i>What,
instead of running to Mexico</i>

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:21.479
<i>like every other idiot?</i>

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:24.732
<i>- I panicked.</i>
- But there's still time.

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:27.568
You got money.
Hire a big-shot lawyer.

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:29.946
The only way a lawyer's
gonna keep me out of jail

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.573
is to get me to plead insanity,
then send me to a looney bin.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.618
I'll be like McMurphy from
<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:37.954
Yeah.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.622
Nurse Ratched will give me
a lobotomy.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:43.042
(giggles)
All right, Mr. Doom and Gloom.

01:22:43.209 --> 01:22:44.752
Well, I've seen that movie.

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:45.920
The Chief gets away.

01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:48.923
So it's kind of a happy ending,
at least for one of them.

01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:56.514
- You wanna get a soda?
- Sure.

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:43.769
(cash register beeps)

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.402
That's $5.48, please.

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:07.710
(knocks)

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:10.838
What are you doing?

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:12.131
I want you to take the money.

01:24:12.298 --> 01:24:14.925
I don't want the money.
I wanna go to Mexico with you.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.302
You can't.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:17.511
Why?

01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:20.931
Because I'm gonna get caught.

01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:26.997
(horn sounds)

01:25:27.498 --> 01:25:31.502
- (flies buzzing)
- (sirens wail in distance)

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.962
What's the reason for your visit
to Mexico, sir?

01:27:38.504 --> 01:27:39.546
Vacation.

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:42.049
- May I see your ID?
- Yeah.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:55.980
Where are you heading
for your vacation?

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:57.439
Uh, Baja.

01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.191
Got an address?

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:02.278
I'm staying at the Four Seasons.

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:04.655
It's my mom's
wedding anniversary.

01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:31.682
Go ahead.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:51.910
Are you all right?

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:53.287
Do I look all right?

01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:54.830
Give me your hand.

01:29:00.044 --> 01:29:01.086
Where are we?

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.589
Somewhere in Mexico.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.257
(chuckles)

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:09.053
Why'd you come back?

01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:19.646
(sirens wail)

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:56.850
What happened?

01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.194
(horn sounds)

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:19.123
(heart monitor beeps)

01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:29.466
Vincent: (over recording)
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.513
<i>I got the hospital staff to bring
this recording over to you.</i>

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.099
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been there
for a long while.</i>

01:30:38.267 --> 01:30:39.268
<i>I just...</i>

01:30:39.435 --> 01:30:41.562
<i>Just can't bear
to see you lying there.</i>

01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:45.023
<i>I'm not good with emotion,
you know that.</i>

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:49.194
<i>The cab 's booked
for just after 11:00.</i>

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:52.906
<i>I love you more than anything
in the whole world.</i>

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:55.617
<i>You are my world.</i>

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.706
<i>Harper thinks
he's got something on me.</i>

01:31:00.873 --> 01:31:02.583
<i>I don't know what he thinks
he knows,</i>

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:05.169
<i>but you don't need
to worry about it.</i>

01:31:06.003 --> 01:31:07.045
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

01:31:08.589 --> 01:31:10.632
<i>You know,
I imagine us together...</i>

01:31:11.592 --> 01:31:12.593
<i>real soon.</i>

01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:15.304
<i>And we're gonna be so happy.</i>

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:18.348
<i>And all this misery
will be behind us.</i>

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:05.103
Cherry: <i>Johnny used to say
that bad luck followed me</i>

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.189
<i>like a pervert followed
a school bus.</i>

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:12.986
<i>But Johnny could be wrong,
just like anyone.</i>

01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:28.377
He did say one thing, though,
that seemed to ring true...

01:32:31.922 --> 01:32:33.715
<i>that when a man's got murder
on his mind...</i>

01:32:34.508 --> 01:32:36.009
<i>he should dig two graves.</i>

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:40.389
<i>One for the victim.</i>

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:43.475
<i>And one for himself.</i>
