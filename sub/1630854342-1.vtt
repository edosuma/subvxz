I didn't fight with you

06:17.585 --> 06:19.486
Okay, I didn't have a shitfit
when you announced

06:19.521 --> 06:21.884
your engagement publicly
without telling me.

06:21.919 --> 06:24.788
But ah, Jack, I mean,

it's not that big a deal.

anywhere, anytime.

06:37.506 --> 06:39.099
-Anytime?
-Yeah.

06:39.134 --> 06:42.135
You invited everyone
we know today.

06:42.170 --> 06:43.906
And now, because she wants
to go after

06:43.941 --> 06:45.578
some creepy billionaire's
wallet,

06:45.613 --> 06:47.844

your own wedding day.

responsibilities now.

06:53.049 --> 06:54.653
Ugh.
What is her fucking problem?

06:54.688 --> 06:56.248
Doesn't she know
this could change our lives?

-Ha!

07:03.059 --> 07:04.960
Of course, it didn't.

07:04.995 --> 07:07.061

turns to shit.

-Alright, Flynn, stop.
-Cut her some slack.

-You need to give Liz a break.
-No, fuck that.

Hey guys,

08:37.387 --> 08:39.791
so you're probably wondering
what happened to the wedding?

08:39.826 --> 08:40.358
We called it off?

08:40.393 --> 08:42.255

08:42.290 --> 08:43.289
Hell no.

08:43.324 --> 08:44.631

08:49.396 --> 08:50.967
-Whoo. What's up?
-Don't wanna play?

08:51.002 --> 08:52.606

08:55.303 --> 08:56.973
Muah. Love you.

09:08.657 --> 09:09.723
David, what the hell?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.284
I thought you said this thing
had seamless Wi-Fi.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.693
Well, it's working just fine
for me.

09:14.663 --> 09:15.860
Same here, babe.

09:15.895 --> 09:16.828
You probably just hit
a dead zone.

09:18.898 --> 09:22.328
Ugh, man meat is being such
a whiny little bitch.

09:22.363 --> 09:23.670
Who?

09:23.705 --> 09:25.672
Jason. You know, my side thing.

09:25.707 --> 09:27.366
"How could I leave without
saying goodbye?"

09:29.139 --> 09:31.711
I swear, sometimes I really miss
toxic masculinity.

09:31.746 --> 09:33.306
Hey, I'm still
toxically masculine.

09:33.341 --> 09:35.341
What bitches, ho, what?

09:36.850 --> 09:38.377
I thought Jason
was your boyfriend.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.280
Boyfriend?

09:40.315 --> 09:41.047
Don't get it twisted.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.887
You said you were
gonna marry him!

09:42.922 --> 09:44.757
I say a lot of things.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.253
I think maybe you're just
looking for like

09:46.288 --> 09:50.224
a Disney fantasy relationship
with a Prince Charming,

09:50.259 --> 09:53.293
when maybe you need
to find patience

09:53.328 --> 09:56.736
and some good in people
and get past your own fears.

09:56.771 --> 09:58.199
Thank you,
but I really don't need

09:58.234 --> 10:00.872
your heteronormative ideas
on romance.

10:00.907 --> 10:01.906
Heteronormative?

10:01.941 --> 10:03.006
Dude, I'm a lesbian.

10:03.041 --> 10:06.075
Exactly. Shackled by labels.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.308
-Yo David, where we at?
-- Lost.

10:08.343 --> 10:10.717
We're over an hour late
and the sun is going down.

10:10.752 --> 10:12.378
Not my fault.
It's this Waze.

10:12.413 --> 10:15.183
It keeps losing signal
and moving our location.

10:15.218 --> 10:17.955
Oh, God, he seriously,
he just missed another turn.

10:17.990 --> 10:19.319
Yeah, David, uh, one question.

10:19.354 --> 10:21.222
Do you think you could manage
to get us there?

10:21.257 --> 10:22.089
-- Shut up!

10:22.125 --> 10:23.895
You guys are ruining
my concentration.

10:25.129 --> 10:26.733
This ruin your concentration,
David?

10:26.768 --> 10:28.460
-Like this...
-- Ladies...

10:28.495 --> 10:30.330
-Oh, no...

10:30.365 --> 10:32.068
David, does this ruin
your concentration?

10:33.269 --> 10:34.235
It's not funny.

10:36.778 --> 10:38.437
Come on.
Stop acting like kids.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.306
Please, David, I'm so bored.

10:39.341 --> 10:40.340
Yeah, guys, stop.

10:42.278 --> 10:43.948
You can't drive, David. Really?

10:43.983 --> 10:46.082
This is really important,
you guys.

10:56.424 --> 10:58.292
Who the fuck is this guy?

10:58.327 --> 10:59.832
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.295
Well, that's a terrible idea.

11:13.309 --> 11:15.144
Well, he seems fun.

11:15.179 --> 11:16.816
Shut up, he can hear you.

11:16.851 --> 11:19.115
Jack, why don't you just go
tell him who we are.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.249
Um, I don't think
he's gonna care.

11:21.284 --> 11:22.481
Look, I'm gonna talk to him.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.515
Just act cool, guys.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.220
-I got this.
-Do you?

11:28.258 --> 11:29.224
Hey, buddy.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.357
Not your buddy.

11:30.392 --> 11:32.326
Ah, okay. Hi.
Sir, how are you doing?

11:32.361 --> 11:33.193
I'm Jack.

11:33.229 --> 11:34.834
-Am I supposed to give a shit?
-Okay.

11:34.869 --> 11:38.970
Hey, I am--
I love your sunglasses.

11:39.005 --> 11:40.774
Are they vintage Ray-Ban?

11:40.809 --> 11:41.907
Fuck off.

11:41.942 --> 11:43.106
Okay, I think we're done.

11:44.945 --> 11:47.374
You got no idea of how much
trouble you're in, do you?

11:47.409 --> 11:49.475
Look, dude,
you came out of nowhere.

11:49.510 --> 11:51.884
We didn't even hit you
and you're fine.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.381
-What's your problem?
-My problem is you.

11:56.418 --> 11:58.825
Turn around, get back
in your little party bus.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.091
Flip a bit,
and get the fuck out of here.

12:01.126 --> 12:04.457
Or, and I promise you,
you'll suffer.

12:06.461 --> 12:08.461
Adult to adult,
you're kinda freaking us out.

12:08.496 --> 12:10.067
Look, we're really sorry.

12:10.102 --> 12:12.234
We just wanna pass through,
so...

12:12.269 --> 12:14.434
If there's anything we can do,
uh, maybe you need,

12:14.469 --> 12:15.501
uh, some extra money.

12:15.536 --> 12:17.371
I mean if you wanted--
Oh, shit.

12:17.406 --> 12:18.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.242
Hey, hey, hey!

12:23.445 --> 12:24.851
You've been warned.

12:28.219 --> 12:29.922
<i>Fucking kids.</i>

12:29.957 --> 12:31.385
<i>They can't resist an invite</i>

12:31.420 --> 12:34.421
<i>to act like</i>
<i>self-important assholes.</i>

12:34.456 --> 12:37.556
<i>Perfect prey for evil predators</i>
<i>like Rektor.</i>

12:37.591 --> 12:40.460
<i>Not to mention the temptation</i>
<i>of fame and money.</i>

12:40.495 --> 12:43.364
<i>Now this I know too well.</i>

12:46.204 --> 12:49.073
Your dad's so lame.

12:49.108 --> 12:50.437
Maybe if you didn't get a DUI,

12:50.472 --> 12:52.076
we wouldn't have to use him
for a ride.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.160
-What?
-I don't know.

13:10.195 --> 13:12.162
Oh, my God, you're not about
to back out on this.

13:12.197 --> 13:13.262
Don't you think
it's a little shady?

13:16.003 --> 13:18.399
An older record label exec
inviting two teenagers

13:18.434 --> 13:20.236
to his hotel room
for a meeting?

13:20.271 --> 13:22.337
So he can listen to our demo,
Mol.

13:22.372 --> 13:23.635
This is how it happens.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.406
-What?
-Getting raped?

13:28.950 --> 13:31.049
Molly and Alexx
from<i> Surburban Trash.</i>

13:35.550 --> 13:38.122
Thought this was supposed to be
a listening party.

13:38.157 --> 13:39.651
Are you tripping right now?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.158
I'm tripping.

13:41.193 --> 13:43.061
This shit is really happening,
girl.

13:45.494 --> 13:47.098
Al? Alexx?

13:48.662 --> 13:50.563
Al?

13:51.665 --> 13:52.906
Jackpot, biatch!

13:52.941 --> 13:54.138
Fuck you, dude.

13:54.173 --> 13:55.535
You scared the crap
out of me.

13:55.570 --> 13:56.635
What's your problem?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.604
Something's off.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.606
Stop being such a straightedge.

14:00.641 --> 14:03.675
Just play the demo,
have a beer.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.918
We'll set a mood.

14:10.321 --> 14:11.353
Okay, now what?

14:13.159 --> 14:14.323
We wait.

14:14.358 --> 14:15.962
<i>First off,</i>

14:15.997 --> 14:19.130
<i>the hotel suite is not even</i>
<i>that nice.</i>

14:19.165 --> 14:21.132
<i>But when you hear somebody</i>
<i>in the other room</i>

14:21.167 --> 14:23.266
<i>speak in an ancient</i>
<i>double tongue</i>

14:23.301 --> 14:26.005
<i>with one of them</i>
<i>low demonic filters on it</i>

14:26.040 --> 14:27.974
<i>that you hear in every</i>
<i>Exorcist film...</i>

14:29.538 --> 14:31.076
<i>you should probably</i>
<i>take the hint.</i>

14:36.314 --> 14:40.250
I'm Alexx,
lead singer of Suburban Trash.

14:40.285 --> 14:45.024
Umm, and this is Molly,
the bassist.

14:45.059 --> 14:47.059
We've had a few...

14:56.037 --> 14:58.004
Oh, fuck.

15:04.672 --> 15:05.671
<i>Guess who?</i>

15:09.446 --> 15:11.347
I'm sorry, daddy,
I screwed up.

15:11.382 --> 15:13.085
Where are you now?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.988
Eleventh floor.

15:15.023 --> 15:16.220
<i>Honey?</i>

15:16.255 --> 15:17.221
<i>Honey?</i>

15:17.256 --> 15:18.552
Just make it go away.

15:23.163 --> 15:25.394
<i>Every slayer needs</i>
<i>his own origin story.</i>

15:25.429 --> 15:27.429
<i>Even your old buddy,</i>
<i>Elliot Jones.</i>

15:28.696 --> 15:29.528
Dad?

15:29.564 --> 15:31.697
Sweetie, where--
where are you right now?

15:31.732 --> 15:33.006
I'm sorry.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.272
-Hey, honey?

15:39.476 --> 15:41.982
That night changed everything.

15:50.223 --> 15:52.289
<i>Some people mourn</i>
<i>like my ex-wife.</i>

15:52.324 --> 15:53.752
<i>With a bunch of pills</i>

15:53.787 --> 15:56.095
<i>and a new boyfriend</i>
<i>named Enrique.</i>

15:58.330 --> 16:01.067
<i>But some search for the truth.</i>

16:01.102 --> 16:05.269
<i>And in my case,</i>
<i>the truth had fangs.</i>

16:05.304 --> 16:07.304
<i>And thus,</i>
<i>my new life began.</i>

16:09.275 --> 16:12.177
<i>As bodies began to mount,</i>
<i>there was a pattern.</i>

16:15.809 --> 16:20.053
<i>Folks being murdered,</i>
<i>more like harvested,</i>

16:20.088 --> 16:22.451
<i>all had the same thing</i>
<i>in common,</i>

16:22.486 --> 16:26.125
<i>their blood,</i>
<i>the rarest blood on earth.</i>

16:30.263 --> 16:33.066
<i>Bloodline leading back</i>
<i>to these dumb fucks.</i>

17:03.890 --> 17:04.823
Jack?

17:08.367 --> 17:10.334
-What's up?
-Look at this.

17:12.536 --> 17:14.569
What is this,
from the Winnebago guy?

17:14.604 --> 17:17.341
Yeah, what if he isn't
threatening us,

17:17.376 --> 17:18.771
he was trying to warn us?

17:18.806 --> 17:20.707
You've been warned.

17:20.742 --> 17:21.675
Oh, with this?

17:23.151 --> 17:25.184
Come on, calm down,
QAnon.

17:25.219 --> 17:26.416
But you don't know anything.

17:26.451 --> 17:28.682
What if--
what if this is legit?

17:28.717 --> 17:30.882
Oh, my God.
You always think the worst.

17:30.917 --> 17:31.783
Did it ever occur to you that

17:31.818 --> 17:35.128
this might turn out to be
a good thing?

17:35.163 --> 17:37.163
Holy shit,
Flynn, come here look.

17:37.198 --> 17:39.726
Jack, Jack, come here,
you have to see this.

17:39.761 --> 17:40.760
Come on.

17:40.796 --> 17:43.895
Listen, I promise you,
it's gonna be fine, okay?

17:54.248 --> 17:56.809
Oh, my God,
look, is that Harry Rektor?

17:56.844 --> 17:57.943
That's Steven's nephew.

17:57.979 --> 18:01.781
He has the most amazing animal
protection non-profit.

18:01.816 --> 18:04.322
I think I might be in love.

18:04.357 --> 18:06.423
-Hm-mm.
-What?

18:06.458 --> 18:07.490
You told me to grow up.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.598
Look.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.600
Holy shit.

18:18.635 --> 18:19.700
Now, that's cool.

18:31.747 --> 18:34.253
You must be the Stream Team.

18:34.288 --> 18:35.914
Guilty as charged.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.421
Hmm.

18:37.456 --> 18:38.587
Welcome to Rektor Manor.

18:45.530 --> 18:46.661
Come on, come on.

18:46.696 --> 18:48.630
I just,
I love it here already.

18:48.665 --> 18:49.829
Hey, my Jullionaires.

18:49.864 --> 18:51.468
We're gonna have
an exclusive look

18:51.503 --> 18:54.669
inside Rektor Manor.

18:54.704 --> 18:55.934
Is it true
there's a cryo chamber?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.903
I love cryo.

18:57.938 --> 19:01.907
Uh.

19:01.942 --> 19:03.843
Look,

You're iconic.

19:26.868 --> 19:28.835
Oh, you're so sweet.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.804

19:37.648 --> 19:39.285
Yeah.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.288
And Jules Jay,
online social goddess.

19:42.323 --> 19:45.522
Oh, I--
I wouldn't say goddess.

19:45.557 --> 19:46.853
Why are people saying that
all the time?

19:46.888 --> 19:47.722
No.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.691
And you are...

19:49.726 --> 19:51.726
David.

19:51.761 --> 19:53.794
Great.

19:53.829 --> 19:56.995
Flynn Chambers,

19:57.030 --> 19:57.996
Am I right?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.339
Uh, not exactly pro yet.

20:00.374 --> 20:02.033
I hear you have an important
match this evening.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.542
Yeah, it's the um,
Modern Warfare semi-finals.

20:05.577 --> 20:07.610
Oh, I love that game.

20:07.645 --> 20:09.381
-No shit.
-Yeah.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.283
Mind if I watch you--

20:10.318 --> 20:11.350
Mind if I watch you play?

20:11.385 --> 20:12.483
Mind if I watch you?

20:23.661 --> 20:25.463
Flynn?

20:25.498 --> 20:26.365
Flynn?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.367
You alright, honey?

20:28.402 --> 20:29.566
Oh, just ignore her.

20:29.601 --> 20:31.029
She's fine, seriously.

20:35.871 --> 20:37.574
Ready to see the rest
of the compound?

21:33.962 --> 21:35.632

made a difference,

21:35.667 --> 21:37.964
especially to the whales.

What can I say?

This is where I leave you.

23:46.963 --> 23:47.929
I'm sorry.

23:47.964 --> 23:49.330
This is where you leave me?

23:49.366 --> 23:51.999
<i>Now this part I admit,</i>
<i>it's a bit of a mystery.</i>

24:00.306 --> 24:02.878
<i>See yours truly is gonna use</i>
<i>a little creative license</i>

24:02.913 --> 24:04.682
<i>and paint a picture.</i>

24:04.717 --> 24:07.817
<i>Like that time in Miami</i>
<i>when a Cuban vamp syndicate</i>

24:07.852 --> 24:11.249
<i>lured the bodyguard</i>
<i>of a Congressman to a penthouse.</i>

24:13.220 --> 24:15.286
<i>The bastard never saw it coming.</i>

24:15.321 --> 24:17.926
David Dean,
Stream Team manager.

24:17.961 --> 24:20.599
<i>Which brings me back</i>
<i>to this idiot schmuck turd.</i>

24:20.634 --> 24:23.228
Uh, I was told to meet here
to go over the deal points.

24:23.263 --> 24:25.098
<i>Nah, that's not the right music.</i>

24:25.133 --> 24:26.231
<i>Let's try this.</i>

24:28.774 --> 24:30.037
<i>That's more like it.</i>

24:37.079 --> 24:39.013
<i>Alright, I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking.</i>

24:39.048 --> 24:42.082
<i>Why they don't just get to it</i>
<i>and waste this asshole?</i>

24:42.117 --> 24:44.986
<i>I'll tell you.</i>
<i>It's a chemical thing.</i>

24:45.021 --> 24:47.758
<i>They say the more anticipation</i>
<i>and fear</i>

24:47.793 --> 24:51.157
<i>that the victim can experience</i>
<i>before the bloodletting,</i>

24:51.192 --> 24:53.060
<i>makes the blood taste</i>
<i>even sweeter.</i>

24:53.095 --> 24:54.061
Jeez.

25:04.678 --> 25:05.677
Fuck...

25:34.906 --> 25:37.335
So, where is Steven?

25:37.370 --> 25:38.743
Natalie didn't tell you?

25:38.778 --> 25:40.646
Not yet.

25:40.681 --> 25:43.341
Steven can't actually see you.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.980
Excuse me?

25:45.015 --> 25:46.982
My husband is in need of care

25:47.017 --> 25:49.215
and he's only able to interact
in person with those

25:49.250 --> 25:50.788
who have taken the vaccine.

25:50.823 --> 25:52.350
Our vaccine.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.022
So, without further ado.

25:57.665 --> 25:58.961
<i>Greetings, my friends.</i>

25:58.996 --> 26:00.094
<i>I thank you for making</i>
<i>the journey</i>

26:00.129 --> 26:01.293
<i>with such short notice.</i>

26:01.328 --> 26:02.393
Of course, sir.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.197
We are massive fans.

26:04.232 --> 26:05.698
-Yeah.
-We are?

26:05.734 --> 26:06.900
<i>I suppose you might be wondering</i>
<i>about Beverly and I</i>

26:06.935 --> 26:09.367
<i>took such an interest</i>
<i>in your little outfit.</i>

26:09.402 --> 26:10.735
Definitely.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.173
<i>After a century</i>
<i>of infecting our planet</i>

26:13.208 --> 26:16.275
<i>with greed, toxins,</i>
<i>and overpopulation,</i>

26:16.310 --> 26:18.651
<i>the planet is fighting back.</i>

26:18.686 --> 26:20.048
<i>The viruses won't stop.</i>

26:20.083 --> 26:22.017
<i>They will continue to mutate.</i>

26:22.052 --> 26:23.755
<i>So, we need to build</i>
<i>a new kind of human.</i>

26:23.790 --> 26:25.251
<i>Stronger, immune.</i>

26:25.286 --> 26:27.352
<i>True warriors.</i>

26:27.387 --> 26:29.728
<i>And you all can be the match</i>
<i>that lights the fire.</i>

26:29.763 --> 26:30.795
Huh.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.863
-Amazing.
-Really?

26:32.898 --> 26:34.832
What my genius husband
is trying to say,

26:34.867 --> 26:36.262
is that we think
you can help us promote

26:36.297 --> 26:38.704
The Rektor Foundation's
new super vaccine

26:38.739 --> 26:40.706
that can turn millions
of possible deaths

26:40.741 --> 26:43.709
into something even more amazing
than just being alive.

26:43.744 --> 26:45.744
Being totally immune
to everything.

26:45.779 --> 26:48.406
And for your promotion
to your combined user base

26:48.441 --> 26:50.408
of 55 million plus,

26:50.443 --> 26:53.884
we're gonna pay you to the tune
of $15 million.

26:53.919 --> 26:55.017
And that's just year one.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.251
Holy shit.

26:58.286 --> 27:00.088
♪<i> Oh man, I got a lot of gold ♪</i>

27:00.123 --> 27:02.893

-Uh, we're in.

27:12.839 --> 27:13.706
Nope.

27:15.875 --> 27:20.207
Uh, um,
do you mind giving us a beat?

27:20.242 --> 27:21.241
Of course.

27:26.116 --> 27:27.720
Jesus, Flynn,
we're about to make millions

27:27.755 --> 27:28.854
by saving the world.

27:28.890 --> 27:30.855
How is it possible you can find
a problem with that?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.153
She's got a point, sis.

27:32.188 --> 27:33.759
But why us?

27:33.794 --> 27:36.762
Uh, hello.
She literally just told us.

27:36.797 --> 27:39.127
No way, they're--
they're hiding something, okay.

27:39.162 --> 27:41.767
That's too much money.
It's too top secret.

27:41.802 --> 27:42.735
That paper that
that guy gave me today--

27:42.770 --> 27:43.736
No, no,

27:43.771 --> 27:45.001
are you seriously talking
about the creepy guy

27:45.036 --> 27:46.002
who threatened to kill us?

27:46.037 --> 27:47.036
-Gross.
-Okay.

27:47.071 --> 27:48.499
Yes, the amount
they're offering

27:48.534 --> 27:50.039
-is weirdly high.
-I mean, we would have do--

27:50.074 --> 27:51.436
we would have done this
for what?

27:51.471 --> 27:52.503
Half a mil?

27:52.538 --> 27:53.944
And also, where's David?

27:53.979 --> 27:55.374
-He should be here, right?
-Yes.

27:55.409 --> 27:56.749
Okay, seriously, Jack.

27:56.784 --> 27:57.915
I can't with her.

27:57.950 --> 27:59.312
You always side
with your sister.

27:59.347 --> 28:00.346
What?

28:00.382 --> 28:03.382
Look, she is not you're only
dependent anymore.

28:03.417 --> 28:05.021
I'm your family now.

28:05.056 --> 28:06.451
Come on, don't you trust
my instincts?

28:10.996 --> 28:12.028
I'm sorry.

28:14.362 --> 28:16.329
-Fuck this. I'm out.
-Flynn?

28:16.364 --> 28:18.331
Jack, look,
just let her go, okay.

28:18.366 --> 28:20.531
Let her go.
It's not about her.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.368
This is about us.

28:22.403 --> 28:24.040
Okay.

28:24.075 --> 28:26.372
You built the Stream Team
from the ground up.

28:26.407 --> 28:27.373
You deserve this.

28:29.047 --> 28:30.442
Okay.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.279
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

28:32.314 --> 28:33.346
Let's do this.

28:33.381 --> 28:34.479
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:39.123 --> 28:43.829
Now, before you sign,
there's just one more thing.

28:43.864 --> 28:46.425
Times are changing
in our media empire.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.362
And because of Steven's health
and none of our heirs

28:49.397 --> 28:51.232
willing to take the reins,

28:51.267 --> 28:53.399
we've been on the hunt
for new partners.

28:53.434 --> 28:55.467
Not just to carry on the legacy
of our company,

28:55.502 --> 28:58.811
but to reinvent it
for today's audience.

28:58.846 --> 29:01.308
<i>Jack, I've been watching you</i>
<i>for years.</i>

29:01.343 --> 29:05.213
<i>You can do so much more</i>
<i>and with my power,</i>

29:05.248 --> 29:06.544
<i>you'll be unstoppable.</i>

29:07.613 --> 29:10.020
Uh, I'm sorry.

29:10.055 --> 29:12.055
Are you talking
about giving us your--

29:12.090 --> 29:13.991
<i>My company?</i>

29:14.026 --> 29:15.553
<i>Yes.</i>

29:15.588 --> 29:17.225
Oh.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.589
Oh, my God.

29:18.624 --> 29:19.898
It's really happening, babe.

29:19.933 --> 29:20.965
We're gonna be billionaires.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.230
Babe.

29:22.265 --> 29:23.264
Ahem.

29:23.299 --> 29:24.837
Uh, no offense.

29:24.872 --> 29:28.368
We are insanely flattered,
but um... why us?

29:28.403 --> 29:30.172
It's simple math, really.

29:30.207 --> 29:32.174
Our research shows
that you alone engage

29:32.209 --> 29:34.440
with ten times more users
under the age of 25

29:34.475 --> 29:38.279
than any other public figure
in the world.

29:38.314 --> 29:39.544
I do?

29:39.579 --> 29:42.052
Of course you do,
my handsome man.

29:43.355 --> 29:45.253
<i>Your 55 million followers</i>
<i>are just the beginning.</i>

29:45.288 --> 29:47.156
<i>Combined with our network</i>
<i>capabilities,</i>

29:47.191 --> 29:49.257
<i>they will expand to hundreds</i>
<i>of millions,</i>

29:49.292 --> 29:51.391
<i>become the backbone</i>
<i>of consumer buyers,</i>

29:51.426 --> 29:54.592
<i>controlling advertising spends,</i>
<i>political influence,</i>

29:54.627 --> 29:55.967
<i>and world markets.</i>

29:59.302 --> 30:02.567
What we're proposing
is a trial merger.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.207
See, how we feel about you
and your new role

30:05.242 --> 30:07.011
as leader of our media group

30:07.046 --> 30:09.244
and after six months,
we make it a little more formal.

30:12.249 --> 30:13.886
It's a simple offer sheet.

30:13.921 --> 30:15.283
David already looked it over.

30:15.318 --> 30:17.087
-It's just...
-Oh, fuck.

30:18.057 --> 30:19.892
Anything you see
or participate in

30:19.927 --> 30:22.554
during this trial merger
stays between us.

30:22.589 --> 30:25.997
It's like a formal family deal
before all the business stuff

30:26.032 --> 30:27.130
gets ironed out.

30:31.466 --> 30:32.938
Yeah.

30:37.978 --> 30:39.472
You ready?

30:39.507 --> 30:44.444
Uh... here we go.

30:52.025 --> 30:53.090
Great.

30:55.963 --> 30:57.490
-Oh, it's amazing.
-Yeah.

31:01.529 --> 31:03.595
This is seriously the best day
of my life.

31:03.630 --> 31:05.168
Well, I mean apart
from our wedding--

31:05.203 --> 31:07.071
-Yeah.
-Of course.

31:07.106 --> 31:08.501
What's up, my Jullionaires?

31:08.536 --> 31:12.043
I'm getting ready for a date
with a real life cowboy.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.376
So, if you have pro tips,
make sure to DM them to me

31:15.411 --> 31:18.247
or comment down below
to impress him.

31:18.282 --> 31:21.547
And I've also been using
Wewe Face Glow,

31:21.582 --> 31:24.517
which is what's keeping me
glowing.

31:24.552 --> 31:28.191
So, uh, for more info,
just check in the link above.

31:28.226 --> 31:31.326
Or swipe up to see more.

31:31.361 --> 31:32.360
Bye, guys.

31:35.299 --> 31:36.397
Oh, Jesus.

31:38.401 --> 31:40.038
What, is the deal off?

31:40.073 --> 31:42.337
No, deal's very much on.

31:42.372 --> 31:44.273
Then what's wrong?

31:44.308 --> 31:46.341
Uh, there is something seriously
off about this place

31:46.376 --> 31:48.442
and I want no part of it.

31:48.477 --> 31:49.982
Okay.

31:50.017 --> 31:51.709
Don't have a Flynn attack.

31:51.744 --> 31:54.151
-Calm down.
-I'm calm.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.681
I'm just telling you
I think we should go now.

31:56.716 --> 31:58.452
What about your brother
and Liz?

31:58.487 --> 32:00.520
They won't listen.

32:00.555 --> 32:02.357
I think this shit's bad.

32:02.392 --> 32:05.327
Okay, what if that guy
on the road earlier was right

32:05.362 --> 32:07.428
and these people
aren't just greedy,

32:07.463 --> 32:09.100
they're evil?

32:09.135 --> 32:10.662
Evil, really?

32:10.697 --> 32:13.236
That thing I read earlier said
Rektor's up to something.

32:13.271 --> 32:15.733
And now they're offering us
all this crazy money

32:15.768 --> 32:17.537
to help them promote it.

32:17.572 --> 32:19.077
What kind of money?

32:19.112 --> 32:20.210
Half a mil? Million?

32:20.245 --> 32:22.080
Are they including me?

32:22.115 --> 32:23.411
I'm serious.

32:23.446 --> 32:25.578
-Are you coming with me or not?
-I would.

32:25.613 --> 32:27.283
I really, really would
but um,

32:27.318 --> 32:28.779
actually I have a date tonight.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.517
Harry.

32:30.552 --> 32:32.486
A date.

32:32.521 --> 32:34.158
Oh, Flynn, come on.

32:34.193 --> 32:36.094
No, no,
it's super cool.

32:36.129 --> 32:37.227
No one believes me.

32:37.262 --> 32:39.559
Everyone thinks
I'm just fucking nuts.

32:39.594 --> 32:42.562
I guess I'll try to find
a signal somewhere

32:42.597 --> 32:44.366
and see if I can catch an Uber

32:44.401 --> 32:47.633
to go play my semi-final
deathmatch alone.

32:47.668 --> 32:49.734
Okay, sorry.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.538
Text me.

32:51.573 --> 32:52.506
Good luck with your deathmatch.

33:05.752 --> 33:07.224
You gotta be shitting me.

33:14.332 --> 33:15.562
I can-- unbelievable.

33:21.735 --> 33:23.834
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

34:02.644 --> 34:04.512
-Shhh, shh.

34:04.547 --> 34:05.876
Don't-- don't move.

34:05.911 --> 34:06.811
Sshh.

34:06.846 --> 34:09.418
Don't scream.

34:09.453 --> 34:11.321
-Get away from me.
-Shhh.

34:11.356 --> 34:13.125
The feeding hour is upon us.

34:13.160 --> 34:16.260
Their heightened senses means
they can see everything.

34:18.792 --> 34:19.791
What the hell's the matter
with you, dude?

34:19.826 --> 34:21.232
You can't just grab me.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.563
You know what?

34:22.598 --> 34:23.663
They had a valid fucking point.

34:23.698 --> 34:24.565
You're the one
I should be scared of.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.732
Not Rektor.

34:26.767 --> 34:27.898
Put that mace down.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.636
I'm trying to save you, Flynn.

34:29.671 --> 34:30.769
How do you know my name?

34:30.804 --> 34:31.603
I'll explain that later.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.343
No, you're going to
explain it now

34:33.378 --> 34:34.443
or I'm screaming.

34:34.478 --> 34:35.510
We don't have time for this.

34:37.382 --> 34:38.645
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

34:40.484 --> 34:41.714
Where the hell are you going?

34:41.749 --> 34:43.221
Hey!

34:43.256 --> 34:45.322
You can't get a fucking signal
out here.

34:45.357 --> 34:47.192
They only get a signal
when they want you to.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.752
Hey?

34:48.788 --> 34:51.394
Come with me now
before it's too late.

34:51.429 --> 34:52.890
I don't need your help, old man.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.404
Oh, I love this.

35:01.439 --> 35:05.474
The smell is so authentic.

35:05.509 --> 35:06.772
It's great.

35:09.744 --> 35:11.909
Jules...

35:11.944 --> 35:13.680
I'm waiting for you.

35:13.715 --> 35:14.780
Harry?

35:17.422 --> 35:18.883
Is that you?

35:18.918 --> 35:20.885
Why don't you come this way,
little lady?

35:24.264 --> 35:26.726
Shit.

35:50.818 --> 35:51.883
Guys?

35:51.918 --> 35:53.390
Guys?

35:57.660 --> 35:59.627
Jack?

35:59.662 --> 36:00.727
Liz?

36:07.967 --> 36:08.867
Shit.

36:17.482 --> 36:18.646
That's more like it.

36:42.804 --> 36:44.441
Shit!

36:44.476 --> 36:45.409
Fuck.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.390
Calm down, you freak.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.853
You're just letting Flynn
get into your head.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.405
I uh, took the liberty
of trying the wine.

37:15.903 --> 37:16.968
It's really good.

37:18.774 --> 37:21.445
Is it biodynamic?

37:21.480 --> 37:22.710
Jules?

37:29.686 --> 37:32.291
Don't worry, cutie,
I'm coming for you.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.027
Hello, Jules.

37:43.062 --> 37:44.369
Oh, shit.

37:45.801 --> 37:49.440
Listen, I'm not gonna
tell anyone

37:49.475 --> 37:51.640
what you guys are up to.

37:51.675 --> 37:52.740
-I promise.

37:52.775 --> 37:54.709
Just-- just-- just let me go.

37:54.744 --> 37:56.612
That's not happening, Jules.

37:56.647 --> 37:58.449
Okay. I thought
that you were a nice guy!

37:58.484 --> 37:59.681
No, I ain't.

37:59.716 --> 38:00.814
Why me?

38:00.849 --> 38:02.552
You-- you love animals.

38:02.587 --> 38:03.883
Remember, the whales?

38:03.918 --> 38:05.720
I love animals.

38:05.755 --> 38:07.986
I just hate humans.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.593
Jules!

38:14.126 --> 38:16.434
You smell tender and juicy.

38:16.469 --> 38:19.437
Aah!

38:19.472 --> 38:21.769
Never trust a guy
with a man bun.

38:21.804 --> 38:22.803
Jules!

38:26.743 --> 38:28.974
Flynn! Flynn!

38:29.009 --> 38:30.448
Don't fight the catch...

38:32.782 --> 38:34.551
We have a connection.

38:52.098 --> 38:54.538
-Jules!
-Flynn! Flynn!

39:03.846 --> 39:04.911
Ah!

39:11.458 --> 39:13.051
<i>Lesson learned.</i>

39:13.086 --> 39:15.625
<i>Never accept a date from a dude</i>
<i>with a man bun.</i>

39:22.568 --> 39:24.997
No. No, no, no, no.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.604
<i>No more swipes up for you,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

39:30.136 --> 39:32.411
You have nowhere to run!

39:43.952 --> 39:46.018
Looks like you needed my help
after all.

39:46.053 --> 39:46.852
How did you--

39:46.887 --> 39:49.054
Know you're gonna get
eaten alive?

39:49.089 --> 39:50.022
Kind of, yeah.

39:58.571 --> 40:00.364
You should come out with me.
I'll show you.

40:04.236 --> 40:05.169
Really?

40:05.204 --> 40:06.973
We're gonna do this shit again?

40:07.008 --> 40:08.645
No, no, I'm coming. I just--

40:08.680 --> 40:10.075
We have to save my brother, too.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.144
Alright, we'll see. Come on.

40:18.591 --> 40:21.185
Oh, wow.

40:21.220 --> 40:23.154
This feels like...

40:23.189 --> 40:24.188
Home?

40:27.732 --> 40:31.701
Our 500 print and television
subsidiaries worldwide

40:31.736 --> 40:34.671
make up 90 percent
of the global market.

40:34.706 --> 40:37.542
By the end of the decade,
we plan to have acquired

40:37.577 --> 40:39.137
-all of them.
-Sweet.

40:39.172 --> 40:40.004
People, they call me,

40:40.040 --> 40:42.547
heartless, a capitalist,
a gold digger.

40:42.582 --> 40:45.275
And this of course one
of our many satellite locations,

40:45.310 --> 40:47.981
where all data and imagery
are run through our algorithms

40:48.016 --> 40:49.752
straight up to the cloud.

40:49.787 --> 40:51.523
Sweet.

40:51.558 --> 40:53.987
Algorithms are kind of my jam.

40:54.022 --> 40:56.693
I just-- I keep searching
for a sense of security

40:56.728 --> 40:58.288
and I know that the second
I find it,

40:58.323 --> 40:59.894
I'm gonna be a whole new person.

41:01.260 --> 41:05.900
Well, I think you found it,
baby girl.

41:05.935 --> 41:06.802
Come on.

41:08.036 --> 41:09.706
We like to think
of our algorithm

41:09.741 --> 41:11.906
as a giant filter

41:11.941 --> 41:14.942
for all the world's facts,
narratives, and viewpoints.

41:14.977 --> 41:16.240
You ready for some real fun?

41:16.275 --> 41:17.175
Yes.

41:20.785 --> 41:22.180
Oh, wow.

41:22.215 --> 41:24.050
Whether you're moderate
or conservative

41:24.085 --> 41:27.988
leftist, fascist, anarchist,
it doesn't matter to us.

41:28.023 --> 41:30.628
My 1975 Halston.

41:30.663 --> 41:33.631
Jackie Onassis wore it once
before I bought it.

41:33.666 --> 41:34.929
Do you wanna try it on?

41:34.964 --> 41:36.733
Heck yeah.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.071
What's mine is yours.

41:45.106 --> 41:46.710
Our ethos has always been,

41:46.745 --> 41:48.877
why be a part
of the conversation,

41:48.912 --> 41:51.781
when you could construct
the conversation itself?

41:53.312 --> 41:54.311
Great question.

41:57.250 --> 41:58.282
Sorry, was that a question?

42:04.290 --> 42:06.895
Good eye.

42:06.930 --> 42:09.997
This is some top secret shit

42:10.032 --> 42:12.197
that I should not be
showing you.

42:12.232 --> 42:13.704
Is it Botox?

42:13.739 --> 42:15.673
This is the vaccine.

42:17.270 --> 42:19.237
It's gonna heal the world.

42:19.272 --> 42:22.042
Total immunity to everything.

42:22.077 --> 42:23.043
Everything?

42:24.684 --> 42:29.720
Just one little shot
and nothing will ever stop you.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.348
Can I do it now?

42:31.383 --> 42:32.921
No.

42:32.956 --> 42:34.692
Oh.

42:34.727 --> 42:36.155
But.

42:36.190 --> 42:37.827
But?

42:37.862 --> 42:40.995
Seeing that we're already
like family

42:41.030 --> 42:44.163
and this is a momentous
occasion,

42:44.198 --> 42:46.066
it feels right
to make an exception.

42:49.071 --> 42:53.205
<i>Now, if an ageless billionaire</i>
<i>has pulled you into a wardrobe,</i>

42:53.240 --> 42:56.208
<i>inviting you to try</i>
<i>a secret serum in a syringe</i>

42:56.243 --> 42:58.210
<i>from a creepy wooden box...</i>

42:58.245 --> 43:00.751
You ready to be
an untouchable queen?

43:00.786 --> 43:01.719
<i>Just say...</i>

43:01.754 --> 43:02.720
Yes.

43:02.755 --> 43:03.985
Yes, please.

43:04.020 --> 43:06.691
<i>Wrong answer, sweetheart.</i>

43:06.726 --> 43:08.055
Hey, uh, thanks for the tour,

43:08.090 --> 43:10.354
but I should probably
be heading back.

43:10.389 --> 43:12.125
My sister
and my friends are probably

43:12.160 --> 43:13.225
wondering about me.

43:14.459 --> 43:15.667
Here we go.

43:19.706 --> 43:22.036
You haven't even met
Mr. Rektor yet.

43:22.071 --> 43:25.039
Oh, uh, oh, why,
is he around?

44:13.518 --> 44:17.322
Welcome to the rest
of your life.

44:22.197 --> 44:23.702
No shit.

44:26.905 --> 44:30.071
I grew up pulling all-nighters
to watch re-runs of your show.

44:32.141 --> 44:34.306
<i>Catch A Criminal</i>
<i>with Elliot Jones.</i>

44:34.341 --> 44:37.144
<i>If you're a criminal</i>
<i>preying on the innocent,</i>

44:37.179 --> 44:39.146
<i>if you assault, rape,</i>
<i>and kill...</i>

44:39.181 --> 44:40.147
<i>Aahhh!</i>

44:40.182 --> 44:41.951
<i>We have a message for you.</i>

44:41.986 --> 44:42.952
<i>Watch out.</i>

44:42.987 --> 44:45.152
<i>Justice is back in town.</i>

44:45.187 --> 44:48.221
<i>Ride alone with Elliot Jones</i>
<i>as he investigates,</i>

44:48.256 --> 44:51.026

<i>and brings down the darkest,</i>

44:54.262 --> 44:56.361
<i>Catch A Criminal</i>

44:56.396 --> 44:57.967
<i>Making America safer.</i>

45:02.138 --> 45:04.402

45:04.437 --> 45:08.406
<i>Thursdays at- 00,</i>
<i>- 00 Central on BDN.</i>

45:16.317 --> 45:17.349
What happened to you?

45:23.522 --> 45:26.864
My daughter, Molly,
she was...

45:28.527 --> 45:30.296
she was murdered
in the hotel suite

45:30.331 --> 45:32.100
of a record label executive.

45:35.105 --> 45:40.812
So... there was a trial,
highly publicized search

45:40.847 --> 45:43.540
for her killer
and all that bullshit.

45:43.575 --> 45:48.149
That's what led to setting
the whole show in motion.

45:48.184 --> 45:51.548
But it was all for her,
it was all for Molly.

45:54.894 --> 45:58.962
I followed every clue
until it led me to the--

46:00.966 --> 46:02.834
the owner of the record label.

46:02.869 --> 46:04.902
Hmm.

46:04.937 --> 46:11.337
Who also happened to be
the owner of the network

46:11.372 --> 46:13.603
that paid for my show.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.209
Steven Rektor.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.577
Steven fucking Rektor.

46:23.516 --> 46:26.022
This is our newest feature,

46:26.057 --> 46:28.618
personally designed
by Mr. Rektor himself.

46:28.653 --> 46:29.485
It's the latest

46:29.521 --> 46:32.226
in immersive
audio-visual experiences.

46:32.261 --> 46:33.865
What like VR?

46:33.900 --> 46:35.328
Like nothing you've ever seen.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.565
A lot of people think
that vampires is the stuff

46:41.600 --> 46:44.304
of fairy tales, and novels,
and all that bullshit.

46:44.339 --> 46:47.241
But little do they know
that Bram Stoker himself

46:47.276 --> 46:48.946
was a vampire!

46:48.981 --> 46:52.378
Making up lies to distract us
from the truth.

46:52.413 --> 46:56.613
That the vampire illuminati
not only walks among us,

46:56.648 --> 47:02.223
they've gamed our entire system,
our financial institutions.

47:02.258 --> 47:04.324
We got shadow governments
making up laws

47:04.359 --> 47:06.128
we don't even
fucking know about.

47:06.163 --> 47:09.461
Massive media mergers,
algorithms, data mining

47:09.496 --> 47:11.496
to control what people think.

47:11.531 --> 47:14.202
While the police state
keeps us in line.

47:15.139 --> 47:17.975
Now, we got a vaccine.

47:18.010 --> 47:20.505
Yeah, all in the name
of healing the world

47:20.540 --> 47:23.145
when it's really about keeping
our blood clean enough

47:23.180 --> 47:24.674
for their consumption.

47:24.709 --> 47:29.250
Rooting out the prey from
a super society of predators

47:29.285 --> 47:35.685
who worship at the altar
of a vampire illuminati.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.093
And that's the truth, baby.

47:39.966 --> 47:43.561
Okay so, I just lie there.

47:43.596 --> 47:46.531
Clothes on obviously, right.
No? Okay, I'm joking.

47:46.566 --> 47:47.664
Alright.

47:49.668 --> 47:50.942
Whoa, here we go.

47:55.014 --> 47:56.244
Have fun.

48:54.172 --> 48:55.072
Hello?

48:57.604 --> 48:58.438
Hello, Jack.

49:01.410 --> 49:02.574
Steven?

49:02.609 --> 49:04.444
Cocksuckers, hang on a second.

49:05.744 --> 49:07.480
Here we go.

49:07.515 --> 49:08.613
Here we go.

49:11.321 --> 49:12.584
The Omega Society.

49:12.619 --> 49:14.520
It's the oldest
and most secretive society

49:14.555 --> 49:16.423
on the planet.

49:16.458 --> 49:17.996
It's more of a cult really.

49:19.560 --> 49:22.330
Their origins date back
since before recorded history.

49:23.531 --> 49:24.629
Want a smoke?

49:24.664 --> 49:26.730
Uh, I-- I vape.

49:26.765 --> 49:27.731
Grow up.

49:29.801 --> 49:35.046
Look, they lived off the blood
of small mammals until...

49:35.081 --> 49:38.346
until they realized
that drinking human blood

49:38.381 --> 49:40.612
would give them immortal life.

49:40.647 --> 49:43.582
If they drank it often enough.

49:43.617 --> 49:45.551
But it wasn't long
until us humans

49:45.586 --> 49:47.256
started fighting back.

49:47.291 --> 49:48.157
By the Middle Ages,

49:48.192 --> 49:50.094
we had these motherfuckers
on the run.

49:50.129 --> 49:53.658
Then, they came up
with a new tactic.

49:53.693 --> 49:57.101
Fleeing their villages
in a mass migration.

49:57.136 --> 49:59.796
And then reintegrating
into our society,

49:59.831 --> 50:04.636
pretending-- pretending,
mind you, to be one of us.

50:04.671 --> 50:06.176
But they're weak.

50:06.211 --> 50:08.112
They have a disease.

50:08.147 --> 50:11.742
The whole family
has had a disease for 350 years.

50:11.777 --> 50:14.184
And now Rektor's dying.

50:14.219 --> 50:16.219
And he thinks you're the cure.

50:16.254 --> 50:17.620
What do you mean cure?

50:17.656 --> 50:20.190
Hunters way before me have been
documenting their kills

50:20.225 --> 50:21.785
for centuries.

50:21.820 --> 50:25.426
But there is one event
that changed everything.

50:25.461 --> 50:27.296
1627.

50:27.331 --> 50:29.496
During the Würzberg
witch trials,

50:29.531 --> 50:32.796
a young woman,
a leper was prayed over

50:32.831 --> 50:36.404
by a powerful French cleric
Armand Jean du som--

50:36.439 --> 50:37.471
something.

50:37.506 --> 50:39.737
Said to be touched by God
Himself.

50:39.772 --> 50:41.277
Anyway, puts his hands on her,

50:41.312 --> 50:44.115
says a prayer, and boom,
she's healed.

50:44.150 --> 50:45.149
Just like that.

50:45.184 --> 50:46.317
True miracle.

50:46.352 --> 50:49.252
Well, she healed so fast,
they thought she was a witch.

50:49.287 --> 50:51.782
Decided to burn her at the stake

50:51.817 --> 50:54.554
but the night
before her execution,

50:54.589 --> 50:55.687
she had a visitor.

50:57.229 --> 51:00.362
A vampire patriarch
brutally drained her

51:00.397 --> 51:04.696
of every ounce of blood
in her frail body.

51:04.731 --> 51:10.306
But her blood...
...it was special.

51:10.341 --> 51:12.902
Infused by
the Holy Spirit himself

51:12.937 --> 51:14.739
thanks to the cleric, you see.

51:14.774 --> 51:19.216
She was given the divine gift
of life.

51:19.251 --> 51:23.154
That will wreak havoc
on the dead.

51:23.189 --> 51:26.850
Her name was lost through time,
but she was forever referred to

51:26.885 --> 51:32.856
as the "Geist des Schicksals",
"the Ghost of Fate".

51:32.891 --> 51:35.562
And through the centuries,
that infected bloodline

51:35.597 --> 51:38.664
has run rampant
through the Rektor family

51:38.699 --> 51:41.865
making each generation
shorter, and weaker,

51:41.900 --> 51:44.835
and more desperate
than the ones before.

51:44.870 --> 51:48.542
And now Steven Rektor thinks
that you and Jack are the cure.

51:48.577 --> 51:49.774
Holy shit.

51:49.809 --> 51:51.809
And hell, I think they're right!

51:51.844 --> 51:54.944
My theory is that not only is
your blood the right type,

51:54.979 --> 51:57.353
but you and Jack have
Rektor DNA.

51:57.388 --> 52:00.653
Your great grandpa
Wilbur Chambers

52:00.688 --> 52:05.889
married a Lydia Riechtor,
which could have been Rektor.

52:05.924 --> 52:07.627
Vampires are changing
their fucking names

52:07.662 --> 52:08.694
all the time,

52:08.729 --> 52:11.367
That's why they're after you.

52:11.402 --> 52:15.800
'Cause they think you and Jack
are part of the family.

52:15.835 --> 52:17.637
So, we gotta go now.

52:17.672 --> 52:19.210
-- We're not ready.
-Why not?

52:19.245 --> 52:20.772
We've gotta prepare.

52:20.807 --> 52:22.675
I thought that's what
we've been doing.

52:22.710 --> 52:24.974
I've been killing vamps
a long time, honey.

52:25.009 --> 52:28.384
Steven Rektor,
that son of a bitch,

52:28.419 --> 52:29.616
he ain't no ordinary vampire.

52:29.651 --> 52:30.650
Nope.

52:30.685 --> 52:32.685
He's a dark lord,

52:32.720 --> 52:35.721
whose royal bloodline goes back
to the very beginning.

52:35.756 --> 52:37.558
Now, you take him out,

52:37.593 --> 52:39.791
you take out one of the biggest
vamp syndicates of all time.

52:39.826 --> 52:42.299
I can't believe this is
my fucking life right now.

52:42.334 --> 52:46.204
Okay. Rektor's birthday
as on record is 1921.

52:47.636 --> 52:51.506
Now, a vampire's natural
lifespan is of course endless.

52:51.541 --> 52:53.838
But no financial
or real estate records

52:53.873 --> 52:56.313
ever show one vampire
ever living past

52:56.348 --> 52:56.874
the century mark.

52:56.909 --> 52:58.612
What does that mean?

52:58.647 --> 53:00.416
It means after 100 years,

53:00.451 --> 53:03.584
they simply vanish
into thin air.

53:03.619 --> 53:05.883
So you're saying that Rektor
is near the...

53:05.918 --> 53:07.885
expiration date.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.988
But he's also immortal,
so what does that mean?

53:12.023 --> 53:15.596
Vampires age and die
just like you and me.

53:15.631 --> 53:18.533
But their spirit never does.

53:18.568 --> 53:21.866
They simply move on
to a new host.

53:21.901 --> 53:23.769
Somebody they feel can carry on
their legacy.

53:23.804 --> 53:25.870
Yup, yup, that's Jack.

53:27.643 --> 53:28.939
I've been waiting for you.

53:32.076 --> 53:33.350
Wow, man.

53:33.385 --> 53:34.747
You look so...

53:34.782 --> 53:35.814
Real.

53:35.849 --> 53:37.750
Yeah.

53:37.785 --> 53:39.389
What-- and dude, this place,
it's--

53:39.424 --> 53:40.951
It's ah...

53:40.986 --> 53:43.492
You know, it's strange,
it kind of reminds me of, um...

53:43.527 --> 53:44.790
Winston's Bar and Grill?

53:46.398 --> 53:47.661
Yeah.

53:47.696 --> 53:48.530
Dude.

53:48.565 --> 53:49.663
Oh, yeah, no.

53:49.698 --> 53:52.633
Man, I-- I used to work here.

53:52.668 --> 53:54.899
I mean not here,
you know the-- the real one.

53:54.934 --> 53:56.736
Not virtual, but...

53:56.771 --> 53:58.639
Yeah, no, I-- I was the DJ.

54:00.511 --> 54:02.742
I mean to be honest,
I was pretty fucking bad.

54:04.012 --> 54:08.319
Umm, but this place is where
I made my first YouTube videos

54:08.354 --> 54:09.078
with my roommate.

54:09.113 --> 54:10.915
It's uh...

54:10.950 --> 54:12.983
How did you know?

54:13.018 --> 54:14.655
I know everything about you.

54:14.690 --> 54:20.023
Your high school crush
to your first viral video.

54:20.058 --> 54:23.059
The first million dollars
you ever made.

54:23.094 --> 54:26.634
The day you met Liz
to the exact amount of money

54:26.669 --> 54:29.604
in your checking account
right now.

54:30.904 --> 54:32.772
Yeah. Oh, shit, uh...

54:32.807 --> 54:35.808
You-- about that,
umm, Mr. Rektor,

54:35.843 --> 54:38.514
the reason that account
is so low is just because,

54:38.549 --> 54:40.813
you know,
our overheads are so high.

54:40.848 --> 54:43.079
Uh, but I can assure you
Stream Team's value

54:43.114 --> 54:44.817
is still rocking high.

54:44.852 --> 54:47.919
We don't care about all that.

54:47.954 --> 54:50.889
Jack, everything you think
you know about the world,

54:50.924 --> 54:53.694
it's all about to change.

54:53.729 --> 54:56.433
You are about to change.

54:56.468 --> 54:57.698
I am?

54:57.733 --> 55:01.339
It's time for
your next evolutionary step.

55:05.444 --> 55:07.070
Sorry, I...

55:07.105 --> 55:08.676
I think I'm a bit confused.

55:08.711 --> 55:12.416
Umm, when you say--
what do you mean...

55:17.522 --> 55:20.589
Huh, what's going on?

55:25.827 --> 55:26.760
Umm...

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
Hey guys, very funny.

55:33.835 --> 55:35.769
I get it.

55:35.804 --> 55:38.035
You know I thought this was
gonna be like a VR experience

55:38.070 --> 55:41.038
on a beach,
you know or in space.

55:41.073 --> 55:42.941
Something.

56:17.549 --> 56:19.516
Can someone let me out of here,
please?

56:21.080 --> 56:24.620
Oh, come on, okay.

56:28.054 --> 56:30.494
Umm, okay, so, that was great.

56:30.529 --> 56:33.123
I'm-- I'm sorry, I--
I-- I have to go.

56:33.158 --> 56:35.026
It was--
it was nice meeting you guys,

56:35.061 --> 56:36.896
but umm, listen, I'm sorry.

56:36.931 --> 56:39.063
I uh, I-- I really gotta go.

56:39.098 --> 56:40.064
You're not going anywhere.

56:40.099 --> 56:40.998
Sorry, Jack.

56:41.034 --> 56:43.100
No, no, it's cool.
No need to apologize.

56:43.135 --> 56:44.838
I'm just gonna let myself out.

56:44.873 --> 56:45.971
It was nice meeting you guys.

56:47.172 --> 56:48.039
Liz?

56:50.109 --> 56:51.207
Hi.

56:53.046 --> 56:55.552
Baby. Oh, my God, baby.

56:59.250 --> 57:00.150
Baby.

57:01.824 --> 57:03.527
Are you okay?

57:03.562 --> 57:05.254
Never better.

57:05.289 --> 57:06.728
Baby, we-- we-- we gotta go.

57:06.763 --> 57:08.532
-Now.
-No.

57:08.567 --> 57:10.160
-Why?
-Why?

57:10.195 --> 57:11.194
We made it, baby.

57:11.229 --> 57:12.866
No, no, we didn't.

57:12.901 --> 57:14.131
This place is a fucking trap.

57:14.166 --> 57:15.737
Baby, we gotta go.

57:15.772 --> 57:16.573
Kiss me.

57:16.608 --> 57:17.574
Now?

57:17.609 --> 57:19.037
Kiss me.

57:19.072 --> 57:20.170
Oh, shit!

57:20.205 --> 57:21.743
Oh, shit.
You're one of them.

57:21.778 --> 57:23.272
Eternal life, Jack.

57:23.307 --> 57:24.173
Think about it.

57:24.208 --> 57:26.176
We have more money, power,
and success

57:26.211 --> 57:27.650
than we ever imagined.

57:27.685 --> 57:29.784
It's the Holy Grail, Jack.

57:29.819 --> 57:32.281
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
this is not okay.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.557
I can't--

57:33.592 --> 57:35.559
We can't be like these people.

57:35.594 --> 57:37.693
We just need to get you
to a hospital.

57:37.728 --> 57:39.992
You know, there's still time.
We can reverse this.

57:40.027 --> 57:42.731
-Oh, fuck fangs, oh, God.

57:42.766 --> 57:43.699
Oh.

57:47.034 --> 57:48.770
Ah.

57:48.805 --> 57:49.903
Goodnight, Jack.

58:09.991 --> 58:11.221
Let me out of here.

58:11.256 --> 58:13.696
Oh, let's not be difficult here.

58:13.731 --> 58:15.258
You should be grateful.

58:15.293 --> 58:18.228
You're about to be a king,
and join the spirits

58:18.263 --> 58:20.065
with the longest bloodline
in the world.

58:22.135 --> 58:24.707
Please, I'm begging you.

58:24.742 --> 58:25.774
There's been a mistake.

58:25.809 --> 58:27.677
This isn't
what we signed up for.

58:27.712 --> 58:28.878
Page six.

58:28.913 --> 58:31.780
A full transference of all
of Steven and Beverly Rektor's

58:31.815 --> 58:34.343
assets, including their own
personal DNA.

58:34.378 --> 58:36.785
You did read the contract,
correct?

58:39.383 --> 58:42.857
Look, whatever you're planning,
just find someone else, okay?

58:42.892 --> 58:46.190
I'm-- I'm not gonna tell anyone,
I promise.

58:46.225 --> 58:47.895
We don't want anyone.

58:47.930 --> 58:49.996
We chose you.

58:50.031 --> 58:52.834
Chose me for what?

58:52.869 --> 58:55.034
Welcome to the family.

58:55.069 --> 58:56.134
What, no!

58:56.169 --> 58:58.708
No, please. No.

59:03.308 --> 59:07.915
Well, full transition,
less than an hour.

59:07.950 --> 59:09.917
An hour?
I saw him like an hour ago.

59:09.952 --> 59:11.622
That's why I'm saying
we should be going now.

59:11.657 --> 59:14.922
These bastards are the most
vicious, the strongest,

59:14.957 --> 59:18.156
fastest, most vile motherfuckers
on this planet.

59:18.191 --> 59:20.763
The games are over, honey.

59:20.798 --> 59:21.597
You walk in that house,

59:21.632 --> 59:23.326
chances are
you'll get exsanguinated

59:23.361 --> 59:25.834
in less than a minute
walking through the door.

59:25.869 --> 59:26.868
Sounds fun.

59:26.903 --> 59:29.266
Hey, I'm serious.

59:29.301 --> 59:30.674
You gotta follow my lead.

59:33.679 --> 59:35.107
Whatever it takes
to save my brother.

59:37.980 --> 59:40.651
You know I always thought
I'd die alone.

59:40.686 --> 59:42.147
It's nice to know
I got some company.

59:45.691 --> 59:47.284
Always aim for the chest.

59:47.319 --> 59:51.123
A wooden stake or a silver blade
through the heart,

59:51.158 --> 59:53.796
are the only proven way
to kill these bastards.

59:53.831 --> 59:55.358
How-- how long have you been
killing these things for?

59:57.703 --> 59:58.999
A long fucking time.

59:59.034 --> 1:00:00.363
Come on.

1:00:00.398 --> 1:00:03.740
Countermeasures,
always have 'em on you.

1:00:03.775 --> 1:00:06.204
Crosses,
the fear of God slows 'em down.

1:00:06.239 --> 1:00:08.206
But mine packs an extra punch.

1:00:08.241 --> 1:00:09.405
Cute.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.242
Holy water.

1:00:11.277 --> 1:00:13.145
Only use this as a last resort

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:15.213
when shit really hits the fan,
okay?

1:00:15.248 --> 1:00:18.986
And no self-respecting
vampire hunter

1:00:19.021 --> 1:00:20.856
ever leaves home without
a pack of these babies.

1:00:22.761 --> 1:00:25.355
Liquid garlic.

1:00:25.390 --> 1:00:29.766
Explodes on contact
with any vamp scum.

1:00:29.801 --> 1:00:31.768
Huh, vamp scum?

1:00:31.803 --> 1:00:34.034
Yeah. What?

1:00:34.069 --> 1:00:35.035
Nothing.

1:00:35.070 --> 1:00:36.806
It's a cool nickname.

1:00:36.841 --> 1:00:38.467
And last but sure as shit
not least,

1:00:38.502 --> 1:00:40.304
there's the four-second rule.

1:00:40.339 --> 1:00:42.240
Now, a typical vampire
just wants to drain your blood

1:00:42.275 --> 1:00:44.913
and leave you for dead, right?

1:00:44.948 --> 1:00:48.950
But if you get fangs in
with the dark Lord or his ilk,

1:00:48.985 --> 1:00:51.953
you got exactly
four Mississippis to get 'em out

1:00:51.988 --> 1:00:52.787
before you turn.

1:00:52.822 --> 1:00:55.385
And if you do turn,
I got no choice,

1:00:55.420 --> 1:00:58.454
but to stake your ass
to the grave.

1:00:58.489 --> 1:01:00.027
Ditto.

1:01:01.525 --> 1:01:02.997
Fat chance, kid.

1:01:05.837 --> 1:01:07.232
We're close.

1:01:08.774 --> 1:01:11.104
Anything else I should know?

1:01:11.139 --> 1:01:14.338
Yeah, yeah, there is.

1:01:14.373 --> 1:01:16.912
We're gonna do everything we
can
to help your brother.

1:01:16.947 --> 1:01:22.214
But there are thousands of lives
at stake here.

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:24.480
Now, we got three hours
till sunrise

1:01:24.515 --> 1:01:26.515
and a lot of vampire ass to kick
between now and then.

1:01:26.550 --> 1:01:30.288
So, are you ready?

1:01:30.323 --> 1:01:33.126
Actually give me one second.

1:01:33.161 --> 1:01:34.996
What the hell are you doing?

1:01:35.031 --> 1:01:37.262
I may have missed
the semi-finals,

1:01:37.297 --> 1:01:39.495
I'm gonna show the league
that I'm good enough to go pro.

1:01:39.530 --> 1:01:41.266
You're filming this?

1:01:41.301 --> 1:01:42.905
Got a problem with that?

1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:43.906
Do I have a choice?

1:01:43.941 --> 1:01:45.809
No, not really.

1:01:45.844 --> 1:01:47.976
Alright, locked and loaded.

1:02:57.344 --> 1:02:58.043
Holy crap, guys.

1:02:58.078 --> 1:03:00.015
Flynn Chambers is back on live.

1:03:00.050 --> 1:03:01.216
Oh, my gosh.

1:03:01.251 --> 1:03:04.052
And it looks like she's in
a secret bunker with her dad.

1:03:04.087 --> 1:03:04.753
That's not her dad.

1:03:04.788 --> 1:03:06.956
Her dad died three years ago.

1:03:06.991 --> 1:03:09.222
Let's just say it,
her outfit's pretty badass.

1:03:09.257 --> 1:03:10.388
She looks like she can kill.

1:03:10.423 --> 1:03:11.862
And the whole bow
and arrow thing

1:03:11.897 --> 1:03:13.897
is very Fortnite 2019.

1:03:13.932 --> 1:03:16.460
But she's bringing it back
and I'm here for it.

1:03:16.495 --> 1:03:18.033
This stuff is
legit scary though.

1:03:18.068 --> 1:03:19.628
We need to find out
who that guy is.

1:03:19.663 --> 1:03:20.530
Yeah, for real.

1:03:20.565 --> 1:03:22.433
That guy is mad sus.

1:03:22.468 --> 1:03:24.006
Wait, look--
looks like she's starting.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:25.975
Shhh.

1:03:45.095 --> 1:03:46.424
Whoa, whoa.

1:03:46.459 --> 1:03:48.965
Easy here, ladies.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.494
Easy, girls.

1:03:50.529 --> 1:03:51.594
Easy now.

1:04:00.473 --> 1:04:01.912
A little help here!

1:04:13.288 --> 1:04:15.123
A little help here!

1:04:30.503 --> 1:04:31.634
Oh.

1:04:38.247 --> 1:04:40.049
Nice reflexes there, lady.

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:43.085
Fuck you very much.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.548
Here.

1:04:44.583 --> 1:04:46.451
Rektor's close.

1:04:46.486 --> 1:04:48.552
I can feel it.

1:04:48.587 --> 1:04:52.127
So when we find Rektor,
how do we take him down?

1:04:52.162 --> 1:04:56.593
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

1:04:56.628 --> 1:04:58.529
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:04:58.564 --> 1:05:00.003
You insane?

1:05:00.038 --> 1:05:02.038
When I said I'd alone,
I wasn't fucking.

1:05:07.672 --> 1:05:11.278
There's no known way to kill
a Dark Lord or his queen.

1:05:11.313 --> 1:05:13.379
I'm just looking for some way,
any way

1:05:13.414 --> 1:05:15.183
to break the cycle
and in the transition

1:05:15.218 --> 1:05:16.987
maybe save your brother.

1:05:17.022 --> 1:05:18.417
Alright.

1:05:18.452 --> 1:05:21.420
The simple fact is ain't nobody
ever done that

1:05:21.455 --> 1:05:23.389
and lived to tell the tale.

1:05:23.424 --> 1:05:26.997
<i>Nobody but nobody</i>
<i>in a thousand years</i>

1:05:27.032 --> 1:05:29.098
<i>has ever successfully taken down</i>
<i>the leader</i>

1:05:29.133 --> 1:05:30.433
<i>of a vampire syndicate.</i>

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:33.729
<i>In fact, there's only been</i>
<i>three documented attempts.</i>

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:38.074
<i>First, is none other than the</i>
<i>inspiration for Dracula himself.</i>

1:05:38.109 --> 1:05:39.735
<i>Vlad the Impaler.</i>

1:05:39.770 --> 1:05:42.474
<i>A brutal leader who,</i>
<i>as legend has it,</i>

1:05:42.509 --> 1:05:47.050
<i>dipped pieces of bread</i>
<i>in bowls of his victims' blood.</i>

1:05:47.085 --> 1:05:49.712
<i>He staked their bodies</i>
<i>all over Eastern Europe.</i>

1:05:49.747 --> 1:05:53.254
<i>But not documented,</i>
<i>Vlad was almost defeated</i>

1:05:53.289 --> 1:05:57.027
<i>by a Bavarian goldsmith</i>
<i>named Syd the Shylock.</i>

1:05:57.062 --> 1:05:59.623
<i>Trapped Vlad with the aid</i>
<i>of his cousin, Esther,</i>

1:05:59.658 --> 1:06:00.924
<i>who well may be a whore.</i>

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:03.660
<i>And he fed him divine water</i>
<i>and garlic injections</i>

1:06:03.695 --> 1:06:05.629
<i>for three weeks straight.</i>

1:06:05.664 --> 1:06:08.302
<i>But one morning</i>
<i>when Syd left for town,</i>

1:06:08.337 --> 1:06:10.139
<i>Vlad seduced Esther,</i>

1:06:10.174 --> 1:06:13.538
<i>with the promise</i>
<i>of a real apple.</i>

1:06:13.573 --> 1:06:15.672
<i>It was very rare those days.</i>

1:06:15.707 --> 1:06:18.114
<i>And that was the end of Syd</i>
<i>and Esther and the last time</i>

1:06:18.149 --> 1:06:22.778
<i>anybody ever saw</i>
<i>or heard of Vlad the Impaler.</i>

1:06:22.813 --> 1:06:25.187
<i>And then there's Jack the</i>
<i>Ripper.</i>

1:06:25.222 --> 1:06:26.452
<i>Most consider</i>
<i>the Welsh murderer,</i>

1:06:26.487 --> 1:06:28.223
<i>the very first serial killer,</i>

1:06:28.258 --> 1:06:31.292
<i>but while Scotland Yard</i>
<i>was desperate to catch Jack,</i>

1:06:31.327 --> 1:06:34.658
<i>one detective,</i>
<i>Frederick George Abberline,</i>

1:06:34.693 --> 1:06:36.198
<i>knew the truth.</i>

1:06:36.233 --> 1:06:38.365
<i>Jack wasn't a serial killer.</i>

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:40.763
<i>He was the leader</i>
<i>of a Welsh vampire syndicate,</i>

1:06:40.798 --> 1:06:43.106
<i>known as The Blood Prince.</i>

1:06:44.868 --> 1:06:48.078
<i>And our friend Frederick almost</i>
<i>busted the entire ring.</i>

1:06:48.113 --> 1:06:50.476
<i>Killed dozens of vamps</i>
<i>including several members</i>

1:06:50.511 --> 1:06:52.346
<i>of Jack's own family.</i>

1:06:52.381 --> 1:06:55.679
<i>But even with the most inventive</i>
<i>steampunk armory,</i>

1:06:55.714 --> 1:06:57.549
<i>some of which</i>
<i>we still use today,</i>

1:06:57.584 --> 1:07:00.486
<i>his tactics were no match</i>
<i>for the Ripper.</i>

1:07:00.521 --> 1:07:02.719
<i>The Blood Prince</i>
<i>seduced Frederick</i>

1:07:02.754 --> 1:07:06.789
<i>with the one thing</i>
<i>the detective always wanted,</i>

1:07:06.824 --> 1:07:08.758
<i>dental surgery.</i>

1:07:08.793 --> 1:07:11.200
<i>Which brings us to the Rektor's,</i>

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:15.600
<i>this creepy fucking bunker,</i>
<i>and our sorry asses.</i>

1:07:15.635 --> 1:07:17.800
Yeah, well, I'm not down
for a suicide mission, bro.

1:07:17.835 --> 1:07:18.735
Okay, you're gonna need
to give me something else

1:07:18.770 --> 1:07:20.407
to work with.

1:07:20.442 --> 1:07:22.541
According to the great prophecy,

1:07:22.576 --> 1:07:24.708
there's one way to kill
a Dark Lord,

1:07:24.743 --> 1:07:26.710
and that's for him
to get fanged

1:07:26.745 --> 1:07:29.119
by somebody
from his own blood order,

1:07:29.154 --> 1:07:32.683
i.e. somebody that he himself
converted.

1:07:33.819 --> 1:07:37.127
That right there is just
downright impossible, honey.

1:07:37.162 --> 1:07:38.524
There has to be another way.

1:07:38.559 --> 1:07:41.296
Now, you find that out.

1:07:42.563 --> 1:07:44.332
And you let me know, okay.

1:07:49.933 --> 1:07:52.472
Our guests have arrived.

1:07:52.507 --> 1:07:54.738
Rektor's bodyguard.

1:07:54.773 --> 1:07:57.873
Might be the only one that knows
where your brother is now.

1:07:57.908 --> 1:08:00.183
Hey buddy, how you doing?

1:08:02.517 --> 1:08:03.714
More coming to your way.

1:08:07.819 --> 1:08:09.522
<i>I bet you're wondering</i>
<i>why the big guy</i>

1:08:09.557 --> 1:08:11.491
<i>didn't take us down?</i>

1:08:11.526 --> 1:08:14.296
<i>Well, because he knows</i>
<i>and I know,</i>

1:08:14.331 --> 1:08:15.792
<i>we're already dead.</i>

1:08:17.466 --> 1:08:18.630
Alright.

1:08:20.205 --> 1:08:21.831
Are you ready for this?

1:08:21.866 --> 1:08:24.504
Because things are about to go
from mildly nightmarish

1:08:24.539 --> 1:08:27.177
to completely batshit
fucking crazy.

1:08:27.212 --> 1:08:28.145
Hmm?

1:08:28.180 --> 1:08:30.213
What do you think,
they're waiting for us?

1:08:30.248 --> 1:08:31.544
What the fuck do you think?

1:08:33.845 --> 1:08:36.318
All the shit we do for family.

1:09:13.324 --> 1:09:15.258
Oh, my God.

1:09:15.293 --> 1:09:17.491
That's the worst thing
I've ever seen.

1:09:17.526 --> 1:09:19.691
All that blood for one vampire?

1:09:19.726 --> 1:09:20.989
Not just one.

1:09:21.024 --> 1:09:22.991
You see all them tube feeders?

1:09:23.026 --> 1:09:25.367
Means this vamp ring
is a lot bigger than I thought.

1:09:27.833 --> 1:09:28.898
Come on.

1:09:37.744 --> 1:09:39.480
Oh, my God.

1:09:39.515 --> 1:09:40.976
-Looks like a--
-Trap.

1:09:46.984 --> 1:09:48.522
Jack?

1:09:48.557 --> 1:09:50.590
Jack, Jack, come on.

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:52.295
Jack, look,
Jack, you have to wake up.

1:09:52.330 --> 1:09:53.527
Please. Jack?

1:09:53.562 --> 1:09:55.265
Stop.

1:09:57.533 --> 1:09:59.632
Mr. Jones.

1:09:59.667 --> 1:10:00.501
Welcome to the party.

1:10:00.536 --> 1:10:01.997
Hello, bitch.

1:10:02.032 --> 1:10:03.372
Flynn.

1:10:03.407 --> 1:10:05.902
Hey, where is he, vamp scum?

1:10:05.937 --> 1:10:08.377
He's been waiting for you.

1:10:08.412 --> 1:10:10.478
Where is he?

1:10:12.548 --> 1:10:14.581
Oh, I'm sorry,
was that a question?

1:10:14.616 --> 1:10:17.419
'Cause I thought you knew
everything about us.

1:10:17.454 --> 1:10:18.453
Try me.

1:10:26.364 --> 1:10:28.760
Jesus, fuck.

1:10:28.795 --> 1:10:30.894
They've been hiding his decline
for years.

1:10:30.929 --> 1:10:33.369
That's Rektor?

1:10:33.404 --> 1:10:34.700
Who did we speak to before?

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:36.570
Goddamn deepfake program.

1:10:36.605 --> 1:10:38.341
Remember, trust nobody.

1:10:38.376 --> 1:10:40.706
Believe nothing.

1:10:40.741 --> 1:10:44.545
And this piece of shit,
it's been a long time coming,

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:47.779
you bloodsucking megalomaniac
shitfucker.

1:10:47.814 --> 1:10:51.552
Now, huh,
we meet at last.

1:10:51.587 --> 1:10:53.015
Well, not exactly.

1:10:58.726 --> 1:11:00.759
You missed them
by about an hour.

1:11:00.794 --> 1:11:03.058
We did?

1:11:03.093 --> 1:11:05.335
Beverly Rektor
has safely transitioned

1:11:05.370 --> 1:11:07.062
to her new host body.

1:11:10.804 --> 1:11:13.035
What about this piece of shit?

1:11:13.070 --> 1:11:15.609
Oh, well, Steven is somewhere
in transit,

1:11:15.644 --> 1:11:17.974
as his host completes
his transfusion.

1:11:20.077 --> 1:11:21.648
Once the royal blood is in,

1:11:21.683 --> 1:11:24.882
it means the spirit can finally
bind the body.

1:11:24.917 --> 1:11:27.588
It's the final step.

1:11:27.623 --> 1:11:28.556
I'm sorry, darling.

1:11:28.591 --> 1:11:29.458
No!

1:11:32.023 --> 1:11:34.925
No fucking way.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.730
He didn't know what he was
getting into, alright?

1:11:37.765 --> 1:11:40.502
You can do whatever the hell
you want with her.

1:11:40.537 --> 1:11:41.965
Stay the fuck away from
my brother.

1:11:44.442 --> 1:11:46.640
Think they'll just kill
each other?

1:11:46.675 --> 1:11:49.610
Have fun draining, Mr. Jones.

1:11:49.645 --> 1:11:51.909
I'm gonna make sure the sister
stays in the family.

1:11:52.879 --> 1:11:55.517
Holy shit.

1:11:55.552 --> 1:11:57.519
They want you to be
the liaison.

1:11:59.721 --> 1:12:01.853
It's a half-vampire,
half-human

1:12:01.888 --> 1:12:04.889
bound to the do the bidding
of the king and queen, forever.

1:12:06.959 --> 1:12:08.123
No.

1:12:08.158 --> 1:12:09.191
That's not gonna happen.

1:12:09.226 --> 1:12:11.665
I've always wanted to taste
someone's integrity.

1:12:13.768 --> 1:12:15.097
Bring it, vamp scum.

1:12:25.681 --> 1:12:26.779
That was easy.

1:12:44.898 --> 1:12:46.062
Jesus!

1:13:10.055 --> 1:13:12.495
Get the hell off me,
you fucking vamp.

1:13:21.869 --> 1:13:22.505
Die, bitch.

1:13:29.811 --> 1:13:31.613
Did she?

1:13:31.648 --> 1:13:32.779
Am I?

1:13:32.814 --> 1:13:34.814
Nah, you're good.

1:13:44.056 --> 1:13:46.221
Alright,
let's shut this shit down.

1:13:46.256 --> 1:13:47.123
Shall we?

1:13:49.094 --> 1:13:51.094
I'm sorry, guys.

1:13:51.129 --> 1:13:54.196
He's mine now.

1:13:54.231 --> 1:13:56.770
Don't listen to her.
She's a queen now.

1:13:56.805 --> 1:13:57.837
Not her true self.

1:13:57.872 --> 1:14:00.070
No, no, that's Liz.

1:14:02.074 --> 1:14:04.514
I'm gonna gut this bitch
once and for all.

1:14:04.549 --> 1:14:06.879
Oh, sweetie, try me.

1:14:16.154 --> 1:14:17.692
A little help here!

1:14:19.762 --> 1:14:21.597
No!

1:15:10.879 --> 1:15:12.142
Flynn!

1:15:12.177 --> 1:15:14.716
Fucking queen,
don't let her get away!

1:16:01.358 --> 1:16:02.830
-Press the blood.
-- Where's the button?

1:16:02.865 --> 1:16:04.161
Press the fucking blood.

1:16:04.196 --> 1:16:05.767
Aahh...

1:16:05.802 --> 1:16:07.164
<i>The plan is not exactly simple.</i>

1:16:07.199 --> 1:16:09.166
<i>Feeding Rektor back</i>
<i>his own royal blood</i>

1:16:09.201 --> 1:16:10.200
<i>takes a lot of steps.</i>

1:16:10.236 --> 1:16:11.368
<i>So, to make it clear,</i>
<i>for all you</i>

1:16:11.403 --> 1:16:15.007
<i>YouTubing, TikToking</i>
<i>cocksuckers out there,</i>

1:16:15.042 --> 1:16:15.975
<i>here are some tips.</i>

1:17:13.364 --> 1:17:14.770
Aaah! Help.

1:17:14.805 --> 1:17:16.706
Oh, my God, Flynn.

1:17:18.171 --> 1:17:19.401
Please get me out of this thing.

1:17:19.436 --> 1:17:21.106
Come on.

1:17:21.141 --> 1:17:24.373
Look.

1:17:24.408 --> 1:17:25.847
Oh, God.

1:17:34.022 --> 1:17:35.890
<i>Ah, you thought I forgot.</i>

1:17:35.925 --> 1:17:38.156
<i>So, the third</i>
<i>and perhaps the closest,</i>

1:17:38.191 --> 1:17:40.730
<i>anybody's ever come</i>
<i>to busting a syndicate</i>

1:17:40.765 --> 1:17:45.867
<i>happened in the afternoon</i>
<i>of November 24th in 1971.</i>

1:17:45.902 --> 1:17:48.804
<i>A charismatic vamp</i>
<i>posing as an ad man</i>

1:17:48.839 --> 1:17:50.905
<i>was well on his way</i>
<i>to manipulating the masses</i>

1:17:50.940 --> 1:17:53.303
<i>through Madison Avenue</i>
<i>and forming a movement</i>

1:17:53.338 --> 1:17:55.811
<i>to create large feeding areas</i>

1:17:55.846 --> 1:17:58.946
<i>that would later become known</i>
<i>as discos.</i>

1:17:58.981 --> 1:18:01.949
<i>But on his way to triumph,</i>
<i>he was double crossed</i>

1:18:01.984 --> 1:18:03.150
<i>by a royal member</i>

1:18:03.185 --> 1:18:05.920
<i>who was determined to use</i>
<i>this disco concept</i>

1:18:05.955 --> 1:18:09.220
<i>for a long time dream</i>
<i>to become a popstar.</i>

1:18:09.255 --> 1:18:12.520
<i>She sold out the ad man</i>
<i>to an elite group of slayers,</i>

1:18:12.555 --> 1:18:17.800
<i>who staged a coup on a flight</i>
<i>from Portland to Seattle.</i>

1:18:17.835 --> 1:18:18.968
<i>Sensing danger,</i>

1:18:19.003 --> 1:18:22.002
<i>the now iconic bloodsucker,</i>
<i>otherwise known</i>

1:18:22.037 --> 1:18:25.401
<i>by the name of D.B. Cooper</i>
<i>disappeared forever.</i>

1:18:27.306 --> 1:18:29.108
-- Oh, fuck me!
-- Oh.

1:18:29.143 --> 1:18:31.275
Oh, God. Whoa.

1:18:31.310 --> 1:18:33.211
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Flynn.

1:18:33.246 --> 1:18:34.278
I'm so sorry,
you were right.

1:18:34.313 --> 1:18:35.851
You were right about
all of it.

1:18:35.886 --> 1:18:36.951
I know,
what else is new?

1:18:38.119 --> 1:18:39.415
Please get me out of this thing.

1:18:39.450 --> 1:18:41.857
-Come on.
-Uhhh.

1:18:41.892 --> 1:18:44.222
Oh, my God.

1:18:44.257 --> 1:18:45.927
-Are we too late?
-Oh, yeah.

1:18:45.962 --> 1:18:48.325
Listen, you did
a pretty good job.

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:49.491
-Yeah.
-What about this?

1:18:49.526 --> 1:18:50.459
Oh, yeah.

1:18:54.971 --> 1:18:57.004
You got three minutes to get
your brother out of here.

1:18:59.437 --> 1:19:01.844
Hey, it was pretty fun,
wasn't it?

1:19:01.879 --> 1:19:03.373
Huh?

1:19:03.408 --> 1:19:05.177
Not really.

1:19:05.212 --> 1:19:06.178
It's alright.

1:19:08.413 --> 1:19:11.051
Let's go.
It was nice meeting you again.

1:19:11.086 --> 1:19:14.318
Hey, remember, trust nobody.

1:19:16.190 --> 1:19:18.025
Believe nothing.

1:19:37.442 --> 1:19:38.342
Flynn!

1:20:06.207 --> 1:20:07.305
Come on, let's go.

I know a lot of you

I definitely do.

1:23:53.137 --> 1:23:55.731
Like is this a new promo
for a new vampire movie?

1:23:55.766 --> 1:23:58.140
If it's so, what's the name?

1:23:58.175 --> 1:24:00.142
And I guess Jules finally
quit the business.

1:24:01.145 --> 1:24:02.771
And when is Liz's new nail kit
coming out?

1:24:02.806 --> 1:24:05.312
'Cause this bitch
definitely needs it.

1:24:05.347 --> 1:24:06.577
Sophie,
what's our news for today?

1:24:09.186 --> 1:24:11.219
Okay, guys,
so I listen to MPR

1:24:11.254 --> 1:24:14.585
and basically, everyone went
missing from the compound.

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:17.588
And there are serious reports
of foul play.

1:24:17.623 --> 1:24:19.095
What's MPR, girl?

1:24:20.494 --> 1:24:21.592
idiot.

1:24:23.530 --> 1:24:25.332
So today our plan
is to look back

1:24:25.367 --> 1:24:27.763
from the live streams and posts
from the past few days.

1:24:27.798 --> 1:24:28.831
But before we do that,

1:24:28.866 --> 1:24:32.735
I gotta give a big shout-out
to our sponsor, LIT.

1:24:32.770 --> 1:24:36.178
It's a new deodorant
for dudes like me and you.

1:24:36.213 --> 1:24:38.444
Also don't forget to subscribe.

1:24:38.479 --> 1:24:40.446
What about my sweatshirt
sponsorship?

1:24:40.481 --> 1:24:41.612
-No one cares about that.
-No one cares.

1:24:41.647 --> 1:24:43.515
But-- but this.
