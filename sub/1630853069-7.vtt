WEBVTT

00:04.629 --> 00:08.508
(classical music plays)

00:12.637 --> 00:13.096
Captain Stede:
Here we are.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.391
Why, thank you.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.939
Mm. Oh, that's perfect.
You got it just right.

00:23.022 --> 00:28.194
I know.
A dollop of milk
and seven sugars.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.280
It wouldn't be
the same with six.
(chuckles)

00:31.823 --> 00:33.867
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.870
Don't know.
I thought I might just
sharpen the old sword.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.747
-Prepare for the next adventure.
-The next adventure?

00:38.830 --> 00:41.249
I can't stay
around here forever.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.461
-Besides, a ship
has only one captain.
-Roach: Captain!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.212
-Yes?
-Yes?

00:46.296 --> 00:49.090
Oh, sorry, that's,
uh, my bad. Your ship.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.508
Who are we saying
is Captain right now?

00:50.592 --> 00:51.718
-Me.
-Him.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.386
Right.
Captain, bad news--

00:53.470 --> 00:54.637
Hold that thought,
will you?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.140
Hey, listen, don't feel
as though you need

00:57.223 --> 00:58.224
to rush out
on my account.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.394
I mean,
we're all enjoying
your company here.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.605
Mate, I know, I know.
Me too.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.191
Uh, just, you know,
I've stayed longer
than I figured I would,

01:06.274 --> 01:09.569
and... I just wasn't built
for sittin' idle, man.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.946
-Roach: Uhh, Captain?
-What is it, man?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.825
-We're out of oranges.
-This is the emergency?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.661
Eat an apple,
for God's sake!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.789
No, the thing is,
we really needed
the oranges...

01:20.872 --> 01:22.290
to treat the scurvy.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.542
Scurvy?
Who has scurvy?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.295
Uh, hello?

01:27.378 --> 01:29.547
My teeth keep falling out.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.051
Is that normal?

01:33.134 --> 01:35.178
(classical harpsichord playing)

01:37.722 --> 01:39.766
So, apparently,
we've run out of oranges.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.310
Uh, yeah, no shit,
and in case you
haven't noticed,

01:42.393 --> 01:44.062
the Swede
has scurvy.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.272
We don't know
that it's scurvy.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.316
-Ay, ay, ay.
Don't breathe over me, man.
-(Wee John gags)

01:48.399 --> 01:50.944
-Go sit--
-I just said we don't
know that it's--

01:51.027 --> 01:54.405
-Go sit over there.
-(all complaining)

01:54.489 --> 01:56.825
Captain Stede:
All right, back to the oranges.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.202
Look, I hate to toss
anyone under the carriage,

01:59.285 --> 02:01.496
but it does seem like
bad meal planning.

02:01.579 --> 02:05.875
Hey! There was
that cake you had me make
with the 40-orange glaze.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.168
You wasted
40 oranges on cake?

02:07.252 --> 02:10.171
On the glaze!
Plus, another 10
for the cake itself.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.841
-All: What?!
-All right, stop going
on about your cakes.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.343
Barely tasted of orange,
if that's any consolation.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.011
Let's just accept
the fact that,

02:17.095 --> 02:20.515
due to Roach's immoderate
use of the citrus...

02:20.598 --> 02:21.850
we now have to go
grocery shopping.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.560
St. Augustine's
full of oranges,

02:23.643 --> 02:25.144
-and we're right near there.
-Captain Stede: Oh, anything

02:25.228 --> 02:26.479
exciting to do there?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.022
Maybe, something
might impress

02:28.106 --> 02:29.774
a world-weary,
adventuring type?

02:29.858 --> 02:34.696
No!
It's boring and awful,
and the humidity?

02:34.779 --> 02:36.698
Do you understand what
that'll do to your hair?

02:36.781 --> 02:37.740
So?

02:39.534 --> 02:41.369
-What?
-Captain Stede: I'll wear a hat.

02:41.452 --> 02:44.038
Are anyone else's
fingernails falling off?

02:44.122 --> 02:44.914
-Oh my god.
-Is that your fingernail?

02:44.998 --> 02:48.126
Right!
St. Augustine it is.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.258
(classical music playing)

02:59.721 --> 03:02.557
(Spanish guitar playing)

03:17.614 --> 03:19.824
Oluwande:
So, you gonna tell me?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.242
-Qué te pasa?
-Are you really not
gonna tell me?

03:21.326 --> 03:24.370
-Tell you what?
-Why you're scared
to go to St. Augustine.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.290
-I'm not scared
of St. Augustine.
-No?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.958
You had a pretty strong
reaction just then.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.085
-No, I didn't.
-Captain Stede: Jackpot!

03:31.169 --> 03:33.755
Roach:
Oh, thank god!
You found the oranges?

03:33.838 --> 03:35.131
Ahh, no.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.550
Bad luck on that
front, I'm afraid.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.927
Apparently,
there's a blight.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.054
Not a single orange
to be found.

03:41.137 --> 03:45.016
But I may have got
something even better.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.643
Lucius, tell them
what I've got.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.811
It's a treasure map.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.356
A treasure map!

03:51.439 --> 03:53.483
Come on, it took
me 40 minutes

03:53.566 --> 03:55.318
of intense bargaining
to get this.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.110
The vendor wasn't
gonna sell it to me,

03:56.194 --> 03:58.404
but I managed
to sweet talk her.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.739
By giving her
a lot of money.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.574
Like, more money than
I've ever seen in my life.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.450
Alright, come on.
Calm down.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.744
It was an investment,
and we'll recoup

04:04.827 --> 04:06.204
once we find the loot.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.331
So...
go fetch my shovel,

04:08.414 --> 04:09.999
the nice one
in the glass cabinet.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.627
W-Wait, what?
What about the oranges?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.962
Still on with the oranges?

04:14.045 --> 04:14.963
-Really?
-What?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.506
Black Pete:
Excuse me.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.634
I don't mind saving the day
on this one, Captain.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.927
Why don't I take a few men

04:21.010 --> 04:22.345
out on reconnaissance,
see what we can't rustle up.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.640
Oh, that's surprisingly
helpful of you, Black Pete.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.142
-Thank you.
-Just make sure Blackbeard
hears about it.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.477
I think Jim should do it.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.145
You know,
seeing as though
they're from here.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.939
-I never said that.
-Yeah, you don't say a lot.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.316
Right, fine, whatever.
Go with Jim.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.193
I've got an amazing day
to plan.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.612
Tell Blackbeard
I took initiative.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.863
This was my mission!

04:40.947 --> 04:42.448
It's still yours.
I'm not going.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.743
-Cálmate.
-Does anyone have
a little baggy?

04:45.827 --> 04:48.329
I'm saving my teeth,
so I can put them back in.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.249
Uh, yeah,
thing is, Swede,

04:51.332 --> 04:52.208
teeth don't
work like that.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.669
Once they're out...

04:54.752 --> 04:56.295
they don't
go back in.

04:59.924 --> 05:04.220
Jim, please help!
Please get more oranges!

05:04.303 --> 05:06.389
The teeth don't go back in!

05:06.472 --> 05:10.268
-Go for a run, Swede.
-Ahh! They don't go back in!

05:12.603 --> 05:14.188
Read it and weep, my friend.
Adventure awaits.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.359
Look, mate,
I hate to be a downer,
but...

05:18.443 --> 05:21.029
people just don't
bury treasure.
It's just not done.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.865
-Well, why make a map?
-He's saying the map's not real.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.950
What?
Course, it's real!

05:26.034 --> 05:29.162
Look at it.
Tatty edges. It's burnt.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.998
It's been around,
it's seen things.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.000
If it were real,
why would she have
sold it to you?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.209
Why not keep
the map herself,

05:35.293 --> 05:36.669
and find
the treasure herself?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.629
Oh, strong question.
Love that.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.214
Well, maybe
she's just lazy.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.009
I mean, she works down
at the dock selling maps,
for God's sake.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.054
Best of luck to you, mate.
I'm taking a nap.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.807
Last I heard,
a ship only has
one captain,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.019
and the captain
of this vessel says,
"On your feet!"

05:53.102 --> 05:56.856
We're having a day...
once I've changed.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.900
-Is he always
this highly strung?
-Yeah.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.659
What?

06:09.535 --> 06:12.205
I can't believe
you made me do this.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.165
You have no idea how
much I hate it here.

06:14.248 --> 06:17.376
Exactly!
I don't know because
you don't tell me anything

06:17.460 --> 06:20.713
because you're
weirdly and freakishly
secretive, Jim.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.298
No, I'm not.
I'm normal secretive.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.176
Jim, Jim, I've known
you for over a year.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.179
I didn't know you
were from St. Augustine.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.098
I don't even know what
your favorite color is.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.558
-What's that got
to do with anything?
-Everything!

06:32.642 --> 06:33.518
We're friends.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.521
Friends tell each other
these kind of things.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.401
Teal. My favorite
color is teal.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.903
Who are you?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.740
I should be
leading this mission.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.326
It's more of a chore
than a mission,
to be fair.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.202
See, I think
the main thing
is you're...

06:51.285 --> 06:53.955
-bad at leadership.
-And Jim isn't?

06:54.038 --> 06:56.666
They just started talking.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.459
Yeah, but Jim's
the kind of person where
if they stabbed me,

06:58.543 --> 07:01.295
I'd be like,
"Yeah, probably
deserved it."

07:01.379 --> 07:03.131
Ah, I would love
to be stabbed by Jim.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.843
Uh, guys?
Think we're all set.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.137
(laughs)
Boom!

07:09.220 --> 07:11.430
-Oranges! Found 'em.
-Wait. No, we don't want those!

07:11.514 --> 07:13.224
-Yes!
-We don't want-- Stop!

07:15.226 --> 07:16.853
Hey, hey!
Drop the orange!

07:16.936 --> 07:19.313
Well, well, well.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.066
Someone looks
a little silly
right now.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.651
Jealous much?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.654
Those are off limits.
We'll go somewhere else.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.991
Why?
'Cause it's a church?

07:30.074 --> 07:30.408
What are they?

07:32.743 --> 07:34.495
Christ's oranges?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.122
(pirate laughs)

07:37.081 --> 07:38.124
Sí...

07:38.875 --> 07:41.460
Is there a problem?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.462
Now, that was
incredibly badass,
especially for a nun.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.008
Don't kill us, Sister.
I'm in the tribe.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.135
Yes, just joined.

07:52.180 --> 07:52.388
Jim: Nana.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.766
(speaking Spanish)

07:56.767 --> 08:00.855
-Nana: Bonifacia.
-I go by Jim these days.

08:02.565 --> 08:07.069
-Well, come in, Jim.
We'll have cake.
-Nana?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.238
-Bet you think
this is hilarious.
-This is fuckin' fascinating.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.366
That's your nan.
Jesus. Coming, Nana!

08:12.450 --> 08:14.160
I'm coming for some cake!

08:14.243 --> 08:17.455
So, we're either here,
or possibly down here.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.542
-Why're you hiding your face?
-I'm freakin' Blackbeard, man.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.169
-I can't be seen
treasure hunting.
-Oh, come on.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.045
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.546
No one's gonna
recognize you.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.257
Hey, Blackbeard!
Treasure, treasure hunting.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.968
Shut the fuck up, okay?
I'm not Blackbeard.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.387
-Okay.
-Oh, dear.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.097
Fuck off!
Get outta here!
Move.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.768
Right... I'll be hiding
over there by that tree

08:38.851 --> 08:41.854
whenever you decide wherever
the fuck it is we're going.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.398
Captain Stede:
Right. Won't be long!

08:44.482 --> 08:46.275
Now look, we're gonna
have fun today,

08:46.359 --> 08:47.735
and that's an order.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.445
You can't really order
people to have fun.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.072
Well, I just did.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.282
Guys like Blackbeard,
they live for adventure.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.909
It's like
nourishment for them.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.327
So, we're gonna have
an extremely fun,

08:56.410 --> 08:59.247
memorable,
deeply cool adventure.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.499
Now, do I have
your support on that?

09:01.582 --> 09:04.252
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay, good.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.295
(laughs)

09:07.505 --> 09:11.634
Bonifacia once bit
a priest's finger off!

09:11.717 --> 09:13.302
-What?!
-(Nana laughs)

09:13.386 --> 09:16.472
Aye.
We thought they were feral.

09:16.555 --> 09:20.101
-Aye, the priest swore...
that he'd die of rabies.
-(Oluwande laughs)

09:20.184 --> 09:22.520
Well, he didn't, did he?

09:22.603 --> 09:27.567
No, he died years later.
He was-- Oh!

09:27.650 --> 09:30.736
-(laughing)
-What? What? What?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.656
-He was crushed by a tree.
-(laughing)

09:33.739 --> 09:37.368
Ha-ha. Wow.
Dark humor over here.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.953
Life is pain.

09:39.036 --> 09:39.954
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It kind of is though,
isn't it?

09:40.037 --> 09:41.539
(speaking Spanish)

09:45.334 --> 09:45.584
(Jim groans)

09:48.838 --> 09:49.839
Ohh.

09:51.632 --> 09:55.594
Muy bien.
Aye, muy, muy bien.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.097
-(Nana laughing)
-Oluwande: You bit a priest.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.015
Nana:
And the rest of them?

09:59.098 --> 10:02.393
The ones... that are
fixing my wall, huh?

10:02.476 --> 10:04.145
Black Pete:
What are you stopping for?

10:04.228 --> 10:08.232
Eh! (claps) Hurry up!

10:08.316 --> 10:11.277
-Jim: They're just
a bunch of idiots.
-Nana: Ah, figures.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.405
Who else would
agree to get paid...

10:14.488 --> 10:17.116
-with oranges?
-(laughing)

10:17.199 --> 10:17.533
Oluwande:
Only Pete.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.120
(flies buzzing)

10:26.792 --> 10:30.171
-Fuck off, flies!
-They're not that bad.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.547
They really are full
of blood, though,
aren't they?

10:31.630 --> 10:32.882
Like little
flying grapes.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.676
(gasps, chokes)
I think I just
swallowed one!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.678
At least you got lunch.
I'm fuckin' starving.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.764
Captain Stede:
Guys! Come quick!
I've found something!

10:43.768 --> 10:45.186
Dryocampa Rubicunda,

10:45.269 --> 10:47.229
or the candied
melon silk moth.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.982
A very rare specimen.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.193
See?
We're already
finding stuff.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.986
Great, you found a bug.
Cheers.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.698
And who says treasure maps
are useless?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.034
I wasn't being sarcastic,
that's just how I talk.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.702
Oh, laugh all you want...

11:01.786 --> 11:04.038
but without the map,
we wouldn't have found
this little guy,

11:04.121 --> 11:05.706
so it's already
paying dividends.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.334
Suppose it is
pretty interesting,
for an insect.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.045
-(flies buzzing)
-Fuck off!

11:11.128 --> 11:12.671
Fuck this.
I'm goin' back
to the ship.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.757
Oh, come on!
We're having fun!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.217
You know what your problem is?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.135
You just have no
idea how to relax!

11:18.219 --> 11:19.637
Does he, Lucius?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.223
I mean, you are
kind of intense,

11:22.306 --> 11:24.433
like...
all of the time.

11:25.142 --> 11:25.976
No, I'm not.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.937
I know how to relax.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.775
See?
I'm actually quite
relaxed right now.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.776
(hissing)

11:33.859 --> 11:35.486
-Oh, fuck off!
-(Lucius yelling)

11:35.569 --> 11:39.156
Fuck you!
Fuckin', fuckin' nature!
Fuck off!

11:39.240 --> 11:43.369
Fucking... little...
mother... fucking... snake!

11:43.452 --> 11:44.787
Fuck you!

11:47.331 --> 11:48.374
(grunting)

11:48.999 --> 11:50.960
Die!

11:51.043 --> 11:52.211
(groans)

11:54.505 --> 11:56.632
According to the map,
there are snakes
in this area,

11:56.715 --> 11:59.051
so... just be careful.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.721
-Hmm... Mmm.
-Mmm.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.101
Admit it.
This is a bit
of fun, isn't it?

12:09.311 --> 12:11.397
Yep.
The snake's nice.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.483
It's actually
really well tenderized.

12:14.567 --> 12:14.650
You could be a chef.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.779
Probably could.
Maybe I will.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.697
I can do anything.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.324
I'd come to your restaurant.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.077
Well, you might not get in.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.454
It's gonna be very popular.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.456
You'd save me a seat,
wouldn't you?

12:28.539 --> 12:28.747
Maybe...

12:31.041 --> 12:32.626
If you weren't being a dick.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.211
What night do
you wanna come?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.713
-Saturday night.
-That's a busy night.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.882
I'll come on the Monday.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.467
Okay.
I can probably
get you in.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.093
It's called
Blackbeard's Bar and Grill

12:41.177 --> 12:42.636
and Other Delicacies...

12:42.720 --> 12:43.971
and Delights...
and Fishing Equipment.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.724
Yeah, but who wants
to go to dinner,
and then you walk past

12:46.807 --> 12:48.559
all this fishing gear
that you can buy.

12:48.642 --> 12:49.977
Maybe a gift shop
out the back.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.979
Then you can say,
"Oh, hope you
enjoyed your meal.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.314
Have you seen
the gift shop?"

12:53.397 --> 12:54.815
Blackbeard:
What do they say?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.651
"Oh, no thanks.
I've just come
for a nice meal."

12:57.735 --> 12:58.652
That's, aw--
Then now, they're angry.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.863
-No!
-They're gonna leave
a bad review.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.906
Another guy from the other
side of the room might go,

13:01.989 --> 13:05.326
"Oh, I'm into gifts.
I'll go and have a look."

13:05.409 --> 13:06.243
Ah yeah, well, that's
the guy I'm after.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.537
I want him to come.

13:08.621 --> 13:08.871
-Who's he?
-That's me.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.706
Aww!

13:12.374 --> 13:13.292
Ooh, you've got a...

13:13.375 --> 13:14.752
little bit
in your beard.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.462
Oh.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.464
No, come to the--
Down a bit.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.217
Just up, up a little bit.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.927
To the, to the left.

13:24.094 --> 13:24.887
Here, I'll get it.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.225
Oh my god,
this is happening.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.392
-What?
-What?

13:30.935 --> 13:31.769
Lucius: Nothing.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.355
More snake?

13:34.438 --> 13:37.024
Captain Stede:
Blackbeard's Snakery.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.151
-That's your specialty.
-Blackbeard:
It's a Snakery Snackery.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.904
-Captain Stede: Snake Snacks.
-Blackbeard: Ooh, Snake Snack.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.948
Captain Stede:
"Want a Snake Snack?"
"Yes, please."

13:44.031 --> 13:45.783
(Spanish guitar playing)

13:50.120 --> 13:53.999
Glad to see
the form I taught you
is still excellent.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.418
So, is there any
prayer here, too,

13:56.502 --> 13:59.213
or is it just
knife work?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.549
Please, don't
get her started.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.842
This child was not
raised to kneel,

14:03.926 --> 14:06.136
or to turn
the other cheek.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.556
I taught them how
to be silent...

14:09.723 --> 14:12.393
stealthy enough to stalk mice.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.562
Patience.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.772
Let it fully
reveal itself,

14:16.855 --> 14:18.816
and then... strike.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.945
(squeaking)

14:25.489 --> 14:27.533
I taught them to kill,

14:27.616 --> 14:29.201
to butcher.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.413
And after many
years of practice,

14:32.496 --> 14:36.375
Bonifacia... was ready.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.044
(flies buzzing)

14:40.838 --> 14:44.800
-Ready? For what?
-To take their revenge!

14:44.883 --> 14:45.926
-Revenge for their bloodline.
-Revenge for my bloodline.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.512
-Revenge for the meek.
-Jim: Revenge for the meek.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.139
-God's divine revenge.
-God's divine revenge.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
Okay.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.225
The Jimenez family

14:53.309 --> 14:57.396
was killed by a roving
gang of mercenaries:

14:57.479 --> 14:59.106
The Siete Gallos.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.610
Seven of
the most dangerous
and brutal killers

15:02.693 --> 15:04.862
this land has ever seen.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.449
Tell me, my child.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.660
Did you hunt them down?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.579
Did you slaughter them?

15:13.662 --> 15:16.624
Did you have them beg...
like dogs for the mercy

15:16.707 --> 15:20.377
they did not...
show your family?

15:20.461 --> 15:23.213
Sí, sí, Nana.
I got oodles of revenge.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.049
Details.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.967
Do we have to do
this right now?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.677
If not now, when?

15:29.720 --> 15:34.475
Tell me, how many
of the Siete Gallos live?

15:34.558 --> 15:37.436
I, I don't know.
Eh, six?

15:37.519 --> 15:38.896
Unless some of them
died of other things.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.523
One?

15:43.150 --> 15:45.361
You just killed
one of them?

15:45.444 --> 15:47.696
The only one
that mattered...

15:50.366 --> 15:52.201
Alfeo De La Vaca.

15:57.247 --> 15:57.873
You just killed...

15:59.249 --> 16:00.000
one of them.

16:00.084 --> 16:03.379
Yeah, but Jim used
the family dagger,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.506
which... I thought was
a pretty nice touch.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.092
I was there.
He was...

16:08.175 --> 16:09.885
He was very surprised.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.097
(speaking Spanish)

16:19.478 --> 16:20.646
Oluwande: Jim.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.940
(knife thwacks)

16:25.609 --> 16:28.737
I'm gonna try and undo
some of the...

16:28.821 --> 16:31.240
damage from that interaction.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.449
Jim!

16:34.201 --> 16:37.788
There's still a few scraps
that didn't completely burn.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
Ah, give it up, Stede.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.375
All adventures have
a natural conclusion,

16:41.458 --> 16:43.502
and this one's
more than fitting.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.504
No, I think
I can fix this.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.839
Come on, the day's
not fully ruined.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.050
God, he'll probably
be moping all the way
back to the ship.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.552
You don't have to be
a dick about it.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.055
-What?
-I said, "Don't be a dick."

16:55.139 --> 16:57.391
Okay?
'Cause he's put together
this whole outing for you.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.476
For me? Why?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.438
Look, you're very cool,

17:02.521 --> 17:03.230
and you wear
leather, okay,

17:03.313 --> 17:05.274
so maybe you won't
understand this,

17:05.357 --> 17:08.235
but everyone is worried
all of the time

17:08.318 --> 17:12.030
whether they're interesting
or adventurous enough for you.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.075
And that bizarre
little man over there
likes you very much,

17:15.159 --> 17:16.201
and you like him.

17:16.285 --> 17:16.869
And if you can't
get over yourself

17:16.952 --> 17:18.746
long enough
to realize that,

17:18.829 --> 17:19.913
you're gonna end up another

17:19.997 --> 17:21.874
leather-clad,
middle-aged sad sack

17:21.957 --> 17:23.125
dying alone in a puddle
of his own piss.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.548
You can stab me
in the face now.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.770
Oh...

17:43.687 --> 17:45.606
It's hopeless.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.357
We might as well
head back to the ship.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.359
You were right.
It's a stupid idea.
I...

17:50.194 --> 17:52.029
I don't know
why we're here.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.157
I'm actually
a little disappointed.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.575
I was startin'
to have fun.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.246
That little bit there on that

18:01.330 --> 18:02.623
little scrappy
bit of paper,

18:02.706 --> 18:03.832
that looks like a tree,
doesn't it, boy?

18:03.916 --> 18:06.210
Yeah, no, definitely.
It does to me.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.961
And the, the other
little squiggly bit.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.963
-What's that look like?
-Yeah, like a, a-- Like a...

18:10.047 --> 18:11.507
-...river or a road.
-Road. R-R-Road or a river.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.758
Maybe, yeah.
Clear as day, mm.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.468
You know what?

18:14.551 --> 18:15.677
I think, just with
this little bit here,

18:15.761 --> 18:16.970
we could probably
sort this out.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.807
-Yeah?
-They're all
the pieces we need.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.350
Plus, the rest
of the map was,

18:21.433 --> 18:22.768
basically, just
blank space anyway.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.311
Hm, shall I prepare
the shovel, or...

18:24.394 --> 18:27.314
Uh, well, we didn't
come all this way
to not dig something up.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.399
Right!

18:31.568 --> 18:32.611
That's the spirit.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.363
Okay.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.783
This way...

18:38.200 --> 18:39.368
I think.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.205
Come on!

18:43.288 --> 18:45.833
-That was very sweet.
-Don't...

18:45.916 --> 18:47.417
or I will stab you
in your fuckin' face.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.877
Yeah, absolutely.
Of course. 100%.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.880
Wait for me.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.051
Oluwande:
There you are.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.555
How'd you find me?

18:59.638 --> 19:01.390
Well, I just...

19:01.473 --> 19:03.809
I just followed
a trail of twigs...

19:03.892 --> 19:05.477
and footprints.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.855
I've seen you get lost
on the ship sometimes.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.690
Yeah.
Where are we?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.110
That's my tree.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.029
My parents planted it
when I was born.

19:16.113 --> 19:20.033
This was my family's land,
and that's where I grew up.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.244
This is where it all happened.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.496
-(chickens clucking)
-(laughing)

19:26.582 --> 19:27.416
Jim:
One day...

19:28.125 --> 19:29.751
a stranger showed up.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.880
(light music playing)

19:32.963 --> 19:33.172
(speaking Spanish)

19:53.525 --> 19:54.735
I will.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.697
♪ ♪

20:06.663 --> 20:08.457
Jim:
I don't remember the rest.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.084
Must've blacked it out.

20:11.168 --> 20:15.172
When I came to,
