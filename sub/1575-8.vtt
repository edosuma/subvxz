WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:01.291
Now we're going to throw it

00:01.291 --> 00:03.917
to our local theater critic,
Tony Tonington. Tony?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Mrs. Tyler's second-grade play,

00:06.083 --> 00:07.750
"H Is For Horses,"

00:07.834 --> 00:10.000
is the kind of
dinner theater dreck

00:10.041 --> 00:12.667
you might expect
from some flyover town,

00:12.750 --> 00:15.000
not Langley Falls.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.500
I'd rather have ass-tearing
diarrhea than...

00:17.583 --> 00:20.333
Damn it, Tony,
shut the hell up!

00:20.375 --> 00:22.500
I have just learned
the "Dinner Party Killer,"

00:22.583 --> 00:24.750
the mysterious man who
shows up at dinner parties

00:24.834 --> 00:27.375
and systematically kills
everyone in attendance,

00:27.500 --> 00:28.834
has struck again.

00:28.875 --> 00:31.208
When Shelly Jenkins invited
friends over for dinner,

00:31.333 --> 00:33.333
she had no idea her fondue party

00:33.375 --> 00:36.041
would soon become
a "fon-death" party.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.041
"Fon-death."

00:38.166 --> 00:39.542
Stupid.

00:39.667 --> 00:43.250
Ah, maybe you should cancel
your dinner party, Franny?

00:43.375 --> 00:44.583
Absolutely not!

00:44.709 --> 00:47.041
I've been looking forward
to this for months.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.709
I'm not about to let it
get ruined

00:48.792 --> 00:50.959
by some dumbass
mass murderer.

00:51.041 --> 00:53.250
What's the likelihood he even
knows we're having a party?

00:53.375 --> 00:55.083
And, speaking of dinner
parties, Francine,

00:55.208 --> 00:56.583
I'll see you tonight at yours.

00:56.709 --> 01:00.208
416 Cherry Street,
Langley Falls, 23655.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.709
Please take all your tampons

01:01.750 --> 01:03.375
out of the downstairs
guest bathroom.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.250

Michelin tires.

All right, Klaus.
You've got this.

No margin for error.

- Preheat oven?
- How the do I do that?

01:47.083 --> 01:48.917
Francine, I'm going to
have to decline

01:48.959 --> 01:50.333
your invitation
to the party.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.166
I just found out Hayley
and Steve are going,

01:52.250 --> 01:53.291
and I hate
talking to them.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.458
Don't worry,
I made a seating chart.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.750
You're next to Lewis.

01:56.792 --> 01:59.000
Lewis, huh?
Fine, I'll go.

01:59.083 --> 02:00.667
But if Hayley or Steve
try to talk to me,

02:00.750 --> 02:03.458
I'm going to give you a very
subtle signal to bail me out.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.208
Like this --
Aaaaaaah!

02:06.291 --> 02:08.125
So stay alert.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.375
Damn, Fran.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.125
You've got this
dinner party on lock.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.959
Seating chart, nice china
and --

02:16.041 --> 02:19.333
is that an aged
Caciocavallo podolico cheese?

02:19.458 --> 02:21.625
What did you do
with the cheese, Roger?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.291
Ha-ha, I switched it out

02:23.375 --> 02:25.667
with a cave aged bleu
from the Pyrenees.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.625
Can you imagine if you were
telling everyone it was

02:27.709 --> 02:30.542
Caciocavallo?
You would have looked so stupid!

02:30.625 --> 02:33.333
Roger, can we
take one night off

02:33.458 --> 02:35.625
from the pranks
and the meddling?

02:35.709 --> 02:38.125
I want my party
to be perfect.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.625
Fine, I'll behave.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.041
I swear on the Good Book.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.542
That's "The Pelican Brief."

02:42.625 --> 02:45.125
I'm sorry, great book.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.375
The guests are arriving.
Just one final touch.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.208
Every dinner party should have
at least one conversation piece.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.333
Who's going to talk
about a chandelier?

02:55.417 --> 02:57.000
You.
Right now.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.083
Pew!

03:01.542 --> 03:04.709
Would anyone like to try
my signature cocktail?

03:04.834 --> 03:07.667
It'll knock your ass out.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.500
Hi! My wife gave me
a list of things

03:11.542 --> 03:13.875
I'm not supposed to talk
about at the party.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.250
Oh, no!
The list is on the list.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.875
Klaus, we're about ready
for those appetizers.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.709
Coming right up.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.500
,
I am so in the weeds.

03:24.542 --> 03:27.250
You cheat your way through one
season of "Master Chef, Jr."

03:27.333 --> 03:29.375
and you think
you can cook anything.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.125
Got to admit, all this talk
of a dinner party killer

03:32.208 --> 03:34.750
made me nervous about
a dinner party killer.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.208
Oh, yeah, I think
I read something

03:36.291 --> 03:37.375
about that on the news.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.083
We don't have to
worry about that

03:39.208 --> 03:42.959
because I only invited
our oldest and dearest friends.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.375
Speaking of.

03:45.458 --> 03:49.875
Colonel Withersby!

03:49.959 --> 03:52.208
Good evening.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.917
Sorry I'm late.

03:54.041 --> 03:57.291
There's a dark storm
closing in,

03:57.375 --> 04:00.709
so I brought all the fixings
for Dark & Stormys.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.917
Uncle Colonel,
you're here!

04:03.041 --> 04:04.375
Mm!

04:04.417 --> 04:07.208
It's not a Smith family function
until the Colonel shows up.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.709
I can't remember the last time
I came over to the Smiths'

04:09.750 --> 04:11.458
and the Colonel
wasn't in attendance.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.500
He's been to every Smith
Fourth of July bash

04:13.583 --> 04:15.583
I've been to.
Not just the Fourth,

04:15.667 --> 04:16.917
there's been
nary an Easter

04:17.000 --> 04:18.417
or Passover
at the Smith house

04:18.458 --> 04:19.917
without the good
Colonel showing up.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.083
Three cheers
for the Colonel.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.500
Hip, hip, hooray!

04:23.583 --> 04:25.959
Colonel,
good to see you.

04:26.083 --> 04:30.250
I hope your investments
in the Sahara are holding up.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.583
Tuttle.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.083
You people still hang out
with Tuttle?

04:35.166 --> 04:37.250
He's on fire.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.959
It's early, and the Colonel
is already on fire.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.083
Okay, Colonel,
phone in the bag.

04:42.125 --> 04:46.291
Rachael Ray says cellphones
will kill your dinner party.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.792
I don't carry
a cellphone,

04:48.917 --> 04:50.458
but I will give you
my cigar cutter

04:50.583 --> 04:52.625
and my iPod Touch.
Now,

04:52.667 --> 04:56.000
why don't we head to the
dining room for the first...

04:56.125 --> 04:59.834
Uh-oh, what's happening?

04:59.959 --> 05:01.959
Oh, no!
Where'd he go?

05:02.041 --> 05:03.125
Where'd who go?

05:03.208 --> 05:04.625
Really?
None of you see it?

05:04.709 --> 05:06.792
See what?

05:06.834 --> 05:10.000
Okay, everyone look around,
get a good feel for the room,

05:10.125 --> 05:12.333
maybe take an extra
look at where Jeff is.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.333
Everyone see it?
Right here, Jeff?

05:14.458 --> 05:15.625
Good.

05:15.709 --> 05:19.125
Uh-oh!
What's happening?

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
-Hey, Jeff's gone.
-Yes, thank you.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.500
Oh, my God!
It's the dinner party killer.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.667
Damn it, Roger!
You promised.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.542
First, Jeff disappears,
and now a theremin

05:34.667 --> 05:36.250
shows up out of nowhere?

05:36.333 --> 05:37.834
The plot thickens.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.583
Isn't this fun?

05:45.667 --> 05:47.500
Jeff's gone and we have
to figure out who did it?

05:47.542 --> 05:50.333
Roger, no one wants to play
your stupid game.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.667
I didn't take Jeff.

05:51.709 --> 05:56.583
It could have been
any one of you.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.709
Roger!
That's not supposed to happen.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.041
Tuttle is missing.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.417
Roger, enough!

06:02.500 --> 06:04.750
I-I didn't do this!
I didn't take Tuttle.

06:04.834 --> 06:06.750
I took Jeff, but not Tuttle.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.000
I'll prove it.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.417
-Look, he's fine.
-Hey, guys, Roger said

06:12.500 --> 06:14.834
I have to stay in the closet
because I'm dead.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.917
Do I get to be alive, now?

06:18.041 --> 06:19.208
Sorry, babe.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.583
It's okay.

06:20.709 --> 06:23.250
I've got my animal crackers
and my bathroom bucket.

06:23.375 --> 06:24.375
Now do you believe me?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.125
No, all you've
proven is that

06:26.208 --> 06:27.375
you definitely
did take Jeff.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.083
I think our boy has got

06:29.208 --> 06:30.709
the Mumbai madness.

06:30.792 --> 06:34.208
We have two options --
throw him in the galleys

06:34.250 --> 06:36.250
or bleed it out of him.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.417
Great idea, Colonel.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.291
Let's lock him in the basement.

06:41.875 --> 06:43.875
You've got to believe me,
I didn't do this.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.041
None of us are safe.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.750
Roger, I'm done letting you

06:46.875 --> 06:48.250
meddle with my dinner party.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.583
Okay, I admit,
I was meddling.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.250
I'm a hardcore
meddle-head.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.125
But I didn't take Tuttle.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.375
Please don't put me
in the basement,

06:55.458 --> 06:57.375
that's where
the scary furnace is.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.500
Colonel.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.458
Aah!

07:01.583 --> 07:02.917
Oh, hello, furnace.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.291
I see your grille still looks
like a super scary, evil face.

07:06.417 --> 07:11.250
Okay! Let's get this DP --
Dinner Party -- back on track.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.917
Mini quiches?
The sun has gone down, Mother.

is posing as a doctor

Note to self -- make an
appointment with Dr. Toshi.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.625
Oh, hey, you guys finally
come to your senses

07:41.667 --> 07:43.000

I can't tell with that ski mask.

Ow!

09:46.917 --> 09:48.625
Stan, you're with Lewis.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.834
Hayley's with me.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.750
That leaves Steve
with the Colonel.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.583
Oh, yeah!

09:53.667 --> 09:55.917
Steve is going to live.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.083
You know
what helps me think?

10:14.125 --> 10:15.291
Drugs.

10:15.417 --> 10:16.792
Eight suspects.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.583
Well, I know it's not me.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.625
Stan! Your beloved Kevin James
head shot.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.667
This whole "murderer loose
in my house" thing

10:35.792 --> 10:39.375
has got me
pretty stressed out.

10:39.458 --> 10:43.000
You know what the number
one killer is?

10:43.125 --> 10:44.709
Stress.

10:46.208 --> 10:47.625
The killer could be anywhere.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.125
We've got to stick together.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.834
Stan, look out!

10:51.959 --> 10:53.125
Lewis is the killer.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.625
He's just giving me
a shave, buddy.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.208
What's got you so worked up?

10:56.291 --> 10:58.000
Uh, the killer?
Oh, right.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.959
I was pretty worked up
able that, too.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.291
Then my boy, Lewis,
here, offered

11:01.375 --> 11:03.333
to shave my worries away.

11:03.458 --> 11:06.041
Barber, do you offer
man-scaping?

11:06.125 --> 11:08.041
You guys are useless.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.041
Do everything
but the taint.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.375
I'm growing that out.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.750
What the hell
is going on in here?

11:15.834 --> 11:18.667
Oh, hey, guys.
I ran into a little snag,

11:18.709 --> 11:20.542
but I called my boy Vikram.

11:20.667 --> 11:24.375
He is the highest rated
Postmates driver in Virginia

11:24.500 --> 11:27.333
and he's on his way
with some gyros.

11:27.417 --> 11:31.208
Klaus, Tuttle is missing,
probably dead,

11:31.333 --> 11:33.834
and now you expect me
to tell my guests

11:33.917 --> 11:36.750
that dinner is going
to be 10 minutes late?

11:36.834 --> 11:39.875
If this party is a failure,
it's on you.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.208
Did you find anything?

11:41.333 --> 11:42.500
Yeah, I found something.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.500
Klaus is trying to ruin
my dinner party.

11:44.583 --> 11:45.917
Come on, we should
check the basement.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.917
Good idea, and,
while we're down there,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.667
we can grab
the good dessert plates.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.417
Dessert? We're not even going to
survive the pasta course.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.083
Tuttle's dead?

11:55.208 --> 11:57.875
Does that mean
I'm only feeding seven?

11:57.917 --> 12:01.542
You guys would tell me if this
party wasn't going well, right?

12:01.583 --> 12:04.375
Oh, Roger, while you're
in there, grab the plates.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.375
Plates, plates, plates, plates,
I hate your stupid, ugly plates.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.959
The plates are right behind me,
aren't they?

12:13.041 --> 12:14.959
Dead Tuttle!

12:15.041 --> 12:17.250
What's this?

12:17.375 --> 12:20.041
The killer must
have dropped it.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.583
It's a lens from a monocle.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.542

who wears a monocle is...

12:38.166 --> 12:41.000
Aah!
What's wrong, boy?

12:41.083 --> 12:44.250
Are you nervous that I don't
have enough knives?

12:44.333 --> 12:45.417

Oh, my God!
Bullock is dead!

12:58.917 --> 13:04.417
I am? What a huge blow
to the Civil Rights Movement.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.291
Stan, we found this monocle
next to Tuttle's dead body.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.333
Colonel Withersby is the killer,
and he's with Steve.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.792
We're too late.

13:15.667 --> 13:19.041
Get away from Steve,
you monster.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.458
But he's still hugging
my scaries away.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.500
We were coming back
from the shed,

13:23.625 --> 13:25.166
and we found this body.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.291
With this bag of gyros
next to it.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.291
-Who the hell is it?
-Let me through, let me through.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.875
Oh, God!
That's Vikram!

13:31.959 --> 13:33.875
He was just trying
to bring us gyros,

13:33.959 --> 13:36.291
and someone killed him for it!

13:36.333 --> 13:38.625
Not someone, the Colonel.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.500
I believe your monocle
is missing something.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.792
That's a prescription lens.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.667
Mine is clear glass.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.959
I only wear this because
without it my outfit

13:48.041 --> 13:49.333
would look ridiculous.

13:49.458 --> 13:54.041
Which means the killer
is someone else, but who?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.500
What's this?

13:57.166 --> 13:59.041
The killer must have dropped it.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.208
It's lipstick,
and the only people here

14:01.333 --> 14:04.166
who wear lipstick
are Francine and Hayley.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.333
I don't wear makeup.

14:05.417 --> 14:06.667
You make fun of me
for it all the time.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.709
And I haven't spent a cent
on lipstick

14:08.834 --> 14:11.583
ever since I got
my lips tattooed cherry red.

14:11.667 --> 14:15.000
Although I do spend a ton
on hepatitis meds now.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.041
-Hello?
-It's Greg!

14:17.166 --> 14:19.583
The party is saved!

14:21.834 --> 14:22.875
What happened?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.166
Last thing I remember,

14:24.250 --> 14:26.041
I was in the bathroom
and heard the door open.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.834
Next thing I know,
I woke up in the bathtub.

14:27.917 --> 14:30.417
Oh, you probably got lead piped.
I got lead piped earlier.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.166
So, what's been going on?
Everyone looks good.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.041
What's going on
is Tuttle is dead.

14:35.166 --> 14:40.041
And we found two clues --
a monocle and some lipstick.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.208
He's squinting.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.583
Of course!

14:43.709 --> 14:45.083
You see, when Greg
reads the news,

14:45.208 --> 14:47.083
he has no problem
with the teleprompter,

14:47.208 --> 14:49.583
but whenever he's handed
a note on air,

14:49.709 --> 14:51.750
he puts on the glasses
he keeps

14:51.875 --> 14:53.583
in his jacket pocket.

14:53.709 --> 14:56.250
See, missing a lens.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.041
Well, that explains the lens,

14:58.083 --> 15:00.041
but what about
the lipstick, Roger?

15:00.125 --> 15:02.542
Great question, Stan.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.083
You see, every newscaster
wears makeup,

15:05.208 --> 15:07.375
but since the advent of HD,

15:07.417 --> 15:08.583
it's more important than ever.

15:08.709 --> 15:09.875
Isn't it, Greg?

15:09.959 --> 15:11.875
Are you accusing me
of being a killer?

15:11.917 --> 15:13.625
Why would I do
something like that?

15:13.709 --> 15:14.917
You needed a story,

15:15.041 --> 15:16.542
and what could possibly be
a better story

15:16.625 --> 15:18.333
than a dinner party killer?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.500
A story about
an elephant and the cheetah

15:20.583 --> 15:22.166
at the zoo being friends.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.333
Shut up!
You made up the killer

15:24.417 --> 15:26.250
and had to kill
to keep the story going,

15:26.333 --> 15:29.750
and thus, you became
the "Dinner Party Killer."

15:29.834 --> 15:32.583
Now, let's lock this maniac
in the basement

15:32.667 --> 15:35.834
so we can all relax and get back
to this fabulous part--

15:35.917 --> 15:38.083
Goddamn it!

15:38.166 --> 15:43.166
I've been stabbed, and I felt
the killer's face in the dark.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.333
I know exactly who it is.

15:45.417 --> 15:49.458
The killer... 's name
will surprise you.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.583
The killer is...

15:52.625 --> 15:54.792
Stan, Francine, Hayley,

15:54.917 --> 15:57.583
everyone pay attention
to what I'm about to say.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.625
This is Greg Corbin
with my final report.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.125
The killer was...

16:04.792 --> 16:06.291
It should have been me.

16:06.375 --> 16:09.041
I should have been the one
falling from the ceiling,

16:09.125 --> 16:11.500
killing the ladies' man.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.625
Papa, I'm scared.
What should we do?

16:20.667 --> 16:21.959
We need to stick together.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.166
All of us in one place?

16:23.291 --> 16:24.959
That's just what
the killer would want.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.542
He's right.
We should split up.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.166
No way, easier to pick us off.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.834
That's just what
the killer would want.

16:29.959 --> 16:32.375
Oh, God, the killer
wants so many things.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.959
How will we ever please him?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.125
We need to settle down
and think rationally.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.000
Klaus, we're ready
for the pineapple whips.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.417
Okay, Klaus. You produced zero
food up to this point.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.083
They need dessert,
and they need it now.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.041
It's time to use
your secret weapon.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.000
Five blenders.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.500
Oh, not again!

16:54.583 --> 16:56.083
We must remain calm.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.166
I believe I'm being stabbed.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.667
Don't worry,
dessert is on the way.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.166
It is confirmed,

17:02.250 --> 17:04.250
someone is stabbing me
right now.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.500
All right, whoever is
stabbing Bullock, 'fess up.

17:06.583 --> 17:07.709
I'm looking for a light.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.542
This killer is like a cat,

17:09.667 --> 17:12.500
toying with me,
keeping me barely alive --

17:13.834 --> 17:16.375
Oh, no, that's
the finishing blow.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.583
Good night, everybody.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.375
I got it!
I got a flashlight!

17:21.500 --> 17:23.041
Hello?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
Stay calm, Roger.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.750
Aaah!

17:30.875 --> 17:33.709
Hello? Stan? Steve?

17:33.750 --> 17:36.208
Thank God, Stan.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.375
Aah!
Entrails.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.125
Steve?
Right here?

17:49.208 --> 17:53.041
This is crazy, there's
a killer on the loose.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.125
Aaah!

17:55.458 --> 17:56.917
Killer, show yourself!

17:57.041 --> 17:58.792
Ugh, this flashlight
is so heavy.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.291
I just need to rest my arm
for one second.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.208
Why do I even have
a gym membership?

18:03.291 --> 18:07.333
It's like I pay $24.99
to not go to the gym.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.500
Aaah, aaaah!

18:13.125 --> 18:15.333
Aaaah!

18:17.500 --> 18:19.083
That just leaves...

18:19.166 --> 18:20.166
Me.

18:20.250 --> 18:24.792
That's right, so now
you know who did it.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.250
Do you want to know why?

18:26.333 --> 18:27.417
Aaaah!

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
You bastard!

18:28.583 --> 18:30.250
I trusted you.
I loved you.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.750
I shredded Tahoe with you.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.166
Surprise!

18:34.250 --> 18:36.792
What...what..
what...?

18:36.917 --> 18:38.959
It was all fake, Roger.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.583
The deaths, the power outages,

18:41.625 --> 18:44.583
all planned out
to the last detail.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.750
You're all alive.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.125
Everything was fake,

18:48.208 --> 18:50.458
even this knife I stabbed
the Colonel with.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.625
This knife is real.

18:52.667 --> 18:56.959
That was not part of the plan,
but the rest...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.458
Oh, we got you good.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.875
You should have seen your face.

19:02.959 --> 19:05.333
But I saw the bodies,
the blood.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.458
Well, we knew we had
to make it look real,

19:09.500 --> 19:13.667
so we stashed bottles
of ketchup around the house.

19:13.792 --> 19:17.166
Which we learned
to find in the dark.

19:17.291 --> 19:21.667
For my death, I hid a
bunch of spaghetti in my pants.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.125
But how did you know
what I would do and say?

19:24.166 --> 19:26.834
That's where I come in.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.000
I wrote over 1,800 pages
of dialogue

19:30.083 --> 19:32.333
to account for any possibility.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.250
We spent months rehearsing
to make sure

19:34.333 --> 19:36.500
we got the performances
just right.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.417
Vikram threatened to
walk out multiple times.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.917
But Vikram killed it.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.834
He's a shining star.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.709
Ahem, casting couch.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.709
Okay. Now I perfectly understand
how, but why?

19:48.834 --> 19:52.166
Because for years you've been
screwing up things

19:52.208 --> 19:54.834
we care about with
your ridiculous schemes,

19:54.917 --> 19:58.583
so we decided to give you
a taste of your own medicine.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.834
Wow, you really taught me
a lesson today.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.750
My pranks, they're childish.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.000
You don't deserve that.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.250
You deserve
to be terrorized,

20:08.333 --> 20:10.917
like you
just terrorized me.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.041
That's not...

20:12.125 --> 20:13.875
And I vow the next time
I come at you,

20:13.875 --> 20:16.375
it'll be a thousand times
harder than you came at me

20:16.417 --> 20:18.208
because that's
how much I love you.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.542
I told you
this was pointless.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.709
Either way, it was
a hell of a party.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.041
A party for the ages!

20:24.125 --> 20:26.750
Absolute rager.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.583
Oh, man, we really got
to get you to a hospital.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.375
But first, how did you fake
the "Dinner Party Killer"?

20:31.417 --> 20:32.875
He's been on the news for weeks.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.750
Oh, he's real, we just
used him to sell the ruse.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.041
Oh, smart.

20:40.709 --> 20:43.125
416 Cherry Street.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.709
No problem.
What are you up to tonight?

20:45.792 --> 20:49.375
Going to a dinner party,
heard about it on the news.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.083
It's supposed to be killer.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.417
Cool.
You have any music preference?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.625
Whatever you got.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.291
Reggae it is.

20:57.417 --> 21:01.083
Hey, you give me five stars,
I give you five stars.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.083
Have a great night!
