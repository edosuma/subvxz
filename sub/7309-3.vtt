WEBVTT

00:09.051 --> 00:10.604
Oh, my God.

00:10.628 --> 00:13.240
The guy in the SUV is
totally checking you out.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.621
Really? Is he cute?

00:15.738 --> 00:17.540
Only extremely.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.316
Okay, he's probably gay. He
looked totally creeped out by us.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.932
What are you talking about?
He's into you. No way.

00:27.956 --> 00:30.401
Yeah. Here, write your number down.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.157
Quick, before he gets away!

00:39.564 --> 00:41.251
Oh, my God.

01:47.663 --> 01:50.676
Is there a reason you're
touching my flowers, Tony?

01:51.287 --> 01:53.549
I- I was just admiring them, uh...

01:53.573 --> 01:55.789
Jenny, flowers are-are
a passion of mine.

01:55.813 --> 01:56.776
Really?

01:56.800 --> 02:00.463
So then, you'd know how
rare and expensive they are.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.081
Oh, yeah.

02:02.144 --> 02:03.456
And their name.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.041
Of course.

02:05.162 --> 02:07.836
Um, well, judging by the color,

02:08.281 --> 02:10.258
and of-of course, uh, the...

02:10.282 --> 02:11.910
the green things they're attached to...

02:11.934 --> 02:13.785
- Stems.
- Stems...

02:13.809 --> 02:15.856
uh, these...

02:17.050 --> 02:18.989
Right on the tip of my tongue.

02:19.615 --> 02:21.341
Phaleonopsis orchids.

02:21.365 --> 02:22.241
Orchids.

02:22.265 --> 02:24.393
Of course they're orchids.

02:27.107 --> 02:30.532
This flipped out when
I was sniffing them.

02:32.944 --> 02:37.385
Tony, how would you rate your
recent performance as team leader?

02:37.409 --> 02:40.364
I'd say it was a solid B.

02:41.213 --> 02:42.445
Minus.

02:43.561 --> 02:44.815
I'm being fired, aren't I?

02:44.839 --> 02:46.771
In a manner of speaking, yes.

02:46.795 --> 02:48.986
If this has to do with
Gibbs coming back...

02:49.010 --> 02:51.006
I have no problem working for him.

02:53.770 --> 02:55.734
These orders are for you.

02:57.332 --> 02:59.073
NCIS Rota, Spain?

02:59.097 --> 03:00.606
Your own team.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.313
Congratulations.

03:02.337 --> 03:04.362
Wow. Uh...

03:04.880 --> 03:05.853
I don't know what to say.

03:05.877 --> 03:10.978
Your performance these last four months
has been exemplary. You've earned it.

03:11.002 --> 03:12.516
What about La Grenouille?

03:12.540 --> 03:14.151
It took months getting in.

03:14.175 --> 03:16.463
You're not getting
too involved, are you?

03:16.487 --> 03:17.767
Only in the mission.

03:17.791 --> 03:21.602
If we put another agent undercover,
La Grenouille will smell it.

03:22.451 --> 03:25.275
So, you're passing on a promotion that

03:25.299 --> 03:27.342
any other agent in this
building would kill for,

03:27.366 --> 03:30.620
all because you're worried
about some long-shot mission?

03:31.447 --> 03:33.112
I don't think so.

03:33.990 --> 03:35.366
Okay.

03:38.558 --> 03:40.332
I'm worried about Jethro.

03:40.366 --> 03:41.985
Jethro's fine.

03:42.009 --> 03:44.222
Then how do you explain
that thing on his upper lip?

03:44.246 --> 03:45.908
Looks like Wilford Brimley Jr.

03:45.932 --> 03:49.066
So, you're turning down looks like
a promotion because of a moustache?

03:49.090 --> 03:51.195
His memory is still screwed up.

03:51.568 --> 03:54.660
He called Ziva Kate yesterday.

03:54.716 --> 03:57.579
I just want to make sure he's a
hundred percent before I leave.

03:57.650 --> 03:58.890
I see.

03:59.283 --> 04:01.456
And how long might that process take?

04:01.480 --> 04:04.085
I don't know, maybe... a few months?

04:05.085 --> 04:06.994
How does 72 hours sound?

04:07.018 --> 04:09.994
- Very fast.
- It wasn't a question.

04:10.086 --> 04:12.875
I need an answer by the end of the week.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.882
Tony, if you pass this up...

04:15.906 --> 04:19.430
another opportunity like
this might not come up for years.

04:26.415 --> 04:29.582
Can we keep this like
the Grenouille mission-

04:29.638 --> 04:31.347
just between the two of us?

04:32.548 --> 04:33.932
If you wish.

04:35.069 --> 04:36.165
Thank you.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.272
DiNozzo.

04:50.868 --> 04:53.624
Stop calling me from
dispatch, will you, Mollvaney?

04:53.648 --> 04:56.077
I'm not the team leader
any more; Gibbs is.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.495
Trust me, it makes a difference.

04:59.519 --> 05:01.731
Now, call him and leave me alone.

05:02.673 --> 05:03.780
Problems, Tony?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.639
Wrong number, Ziva.

05:07.478 --> 05:08.167
Gibbs.

05:08.191 --> 05:09.720
There a reason you're gearing up?

05:09.744 --> 05:10.814
What's my motto, McGee?

05:10.838 --> 05:14.279
You'll never date a woman
that eats more than you do.

05:15.631 --> 05:18.452
Oh, yeah. That's true.
But: Always be prepared.

05:18.476 --> 05:20.037
The batsignal may fly at any moment.

05:20.061 --> 05:21.382
We're on our way.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.364
Grab your gear. We're heading out.

05:24.068 --> 05:24.977
How did you know?

05:25.001 --> 05:25.517
Well...

05:25.541 --> 05:28.460
it's a gift, McGee. I
choose not to question it.

05:30.916 --> 05:31.728
Where we going, boss?

05:31.752 --> 05:34.991
Ask DiNozzo. All I
got was a wrong number.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.623
Since when do we investigate
stolen cars, Tony?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.834
Since it belongs to a sailor

05:45.858 --> 05:47.931
and someone appears to have
been slaughtered inside it.

05:47.955 --> 05:49.028
So where's the body?

05:49.052 --> 05:53.073
Well, that's kind of the reason we're here. Goes
with the whole criminal investigative thing.

05:53.097 --> 05:55.987
Oh, okay. I understand.

05:56.605 --> 05:57.557
Understand what?

05:57.581 --> 05:59.653
You feel a little threatened,
now that Gibbs is back.

05:59.677 --> 06:00.547
I do not!

06:00.571 --> 06:05.203
You have been whining like
a little snitch all week.

06:06.418 --> 06:09.143
- The term is "bitch."
- I know, I was being polite.

06:10.035 --> 06:13.951
Boss, vehicle's registered to
a Navy Lieutenant Anne Sullivan.

06:13.975 --> 06:16.939
She's a computer
programmer for base housing.

06:16.963 --> 06:19.507
Reported UA this morning.
First time in her career.

06:19.531 --> 06:20.980
Witnesses?

06:21.216 --> 06:22.741
Uh, 911 call.

06:22.765 --> 06:27.480
Two motorists reported a man driving her vehicle,
a bloody woman screaming in the back. I'm...

06:27.504 --> 06:29.573
assuming that's
our missing Lieutenant.

06:29.867 --> 06:30.822
Assuming?

06:30.846 --> 06:34.246
Well, Fredericksburg PD has descriptions
of the woman and her abductor.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.670
They're sending them
to NCIS as we speak.

06:36.694 --> 06:38.247
That's a good job, Tim.

06:39.578 --> 06:41.877
Can I help you find something, boss?

06:42.121 --> 06:44.578
- Maybe...
- My notepads.

06:47.325 --> 06:48.759
Right back here.

06:49.806 --> 06:51.885
We reorganized the supplies.

06:52.352 --> 06:54.788
Tony felt this way was more efficient.

06:56.364 --> 06:57.734
You don't say.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.910
Well, you know, I could put them
back the way it was before you quit.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.073
Retired.

07:06.237 --> 07:08.281
Well, that depends, McGee.

07:08.305 --> 07:09.934
Is it more efficient?

07:10.703 --> 07:11.950
Seems to be.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.392
Then leave 'em where they are.

07:17.773 --> 07:19.712
There appears to have been a struggle.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.931
Multiple hand and fingerprints.

07:22.955 --> 07:24.696
A lost shoe, a pair of glasses...

07:24.720 --> 07:28.542
And I don't believe she was slaughtered.
At least not in the back of this vehicle.

07:29.182 --> 07:29.914
Why's that?

07:29.938 --> 07:32.460
The traces of blood are
all from skin contact.

07:32.484 --> 07:35.356
A more serious wound
would've left pools of it.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.464
Enough criminal
investigating for you, Tony?

07:38.722 --> 07:41.442
Lieutenant Sullivan's
address. She ves in Culpeper.

07:41.466 --> 07:42.054
Take McGee.

07:42.078 --> 07:45.919
If you leave now, you can avoid
traffic. Anything unusual, you call me.

07:48.687 --> 07:51.508
I mean, you know, you do... you...

07:51.889 --> 07:54.158
whatever you want them to do, boss.

07:57.316 --> 08:00.105
So I got used to being
in charge, sue me.

08:01.984 --> 08:04.473
Is there a reason why
you always have to drive?

08:04.497 --> 08:08.388
I could say it's because I'm the Senior Field
Agent, but mostly because I want to live.

08:08.412 --> 08:10.940
Then I recommend you getting
unused to being in charge.

08:10.964 --> 08:13.220
Before Gibbs decides to kill you.

08:18.037 --> 08:20.037
Tow truck should be
here any minute, boss.

08:20.061 --> 08:21.957
You find the other shoe yet, McGee?

08:23.168 --> 08:24.714
There was only one in the vehicle.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.830
You ever see a woman try to
walk with one high heel on?

08:28.494 --> 08:29.598
Not pretty.

08:31.066 --> 08:32.429
Hey, look at this.

08:35.413 --> 08:37.390
Blood smears on the pavement.

08:37.678 --> 08:40.485
If she was carried, they'd be drops.

08:40.671 --> 08:44.515
And what looks like a strand of
nylon thread, maybe from a stocking.

08:45.306 --> 08:48.066
She could've fallen
and scraped her knee.

08:48.382 --> 08:49.449
Mark it.

08:57.097 --> 08:58.304
Okay!

08:58.328 --> 09:01.474
You're looking for help,
which way would you go?

09:05.902 --> 09:08.461
Well, Waverly's football
team was away...

09:08.596 --> 09:10.408
so the lot was empty all weekend...

09:10.432 --> 09:14.215
She should've headed towards campus, but she
didn't, she went in the opposite direction.

09:15.819 --> 09:16.789
She was forced.

09:16.813 --> 09:18.857
That's good thinking,
Tim-come on.

09:21.553 --> 09:22.980
Another blood drop...

09:26.789 --> 09:29.146
Like I said, the other shoe.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.519
Okay, now, tell me where she went.

09:37.615 --> 09:39.158
There was another car.

09:40.708 --> 09:43.504
Judging by these tire
tracks, they left in a hurry.

09:43.705 --> 09:46.630
Match the tires, we might even
find out the make and model.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.972
Good to have you back, boss.

09:50.936 --> 09:53.390
If you'd let me drive, we would've
been here half an hour ago.

09:53.414 --> 09:57.042
Yeah, our bodies could be in a twisted
wreck, awaiting the Jaws of Life.

09:57.066 --> 09:58.573
Gibbs lets me drive.

09:58.597 --> 09:59.966
I have more to live for.

09:59.990 --> 10:00.632
I see.

10:00.656 --> 10:02.988
Perhaps this new mystery
girlfriend of yours.

10:03.012 --> 10:04.328
She's not a mystery.

10:04.352 --> 10:06.366
Then why haven'tb any of us met her?

10:06.390 --> 10:08.379
Look, it's complicated...

10:26.573 --> 10:27.662
Clear.

10:28.438 --> 10:29.787
This is weird.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.608
I agree.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.976
Someone was obviously
searching for something.

10:35.536 --> 10:37.227
No, I mean this apartment.

10:37.251 --> 10:38.826
What does it remind you of, Ziva?

10:38.850 --> 10:40.630
Put a writing desk over there.

10:40.654 --> 10:42.139
You're right.

10:42.602 --> 10:45.365
- It's almost...
- Identical to McGeek's.

10:48.051 --> 10:49.443
What do you make of this?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.996
Some kind of profile?

10:55.499 --> 10:57.380
They're all profiles.

11:02.190 --> 11:05.692
I think I know what the profiles
might have been used for.

11:06.850 --> 11:08.674
She was targeting people.

11:18.266 --> 11:22.870
This is a police sketch artist's rendering of
what the witnesses saw late yesterday afternoon.

11:22.894 --> 11:26.017
And this is a photo of Lieutenant
Sullivan for comparison.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.573
I'd say that's a pretty good match.

11:27.597 --> 11:29.435
You think, DiNozzo?

11:30.365 --> 11:31.901
The driver, McGee.

11:32.634 --> 11:35.239
Fredericksburg PD put a
BOLO out on him last night.

11:35.263 --> 11:36.655
Any hits? Any hits?

11:37.143 --> 11:38.020
Sorry.

11:38.044 --> 11:39.096
Boss...

11:39.283 --> 11:42.338
Continue... if y want to, of course.

11:45.365 --> 11:49.728
No hits yet, but the local LEOs did
match the likeness to a mug shot.

11:49.892 --> 11:51.111
Justin Farris.

11:51.135 --> 11:52.869
Arrested for car theft five years ago.

11:52.893 --> 11:56.343
Currently lives with his mother. Claims
she hasn't seen him since yesterday.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.512
Our lieutenant had around 16
profiles on people at her apartment.

11:59.536 --> 12:02.520
Without photographs or names.
I'm still waiting on the why.

12:03.678 --> 12:05.908
Me too, boss. I'm just saying...

12:05.993 --> 12:07.468
Farris might be one of them...

12:07.492 --> 12:09.023
Our Rosetta stone, if you will.

12:09.047 --> 12:10.108
Find him.

12:10.358 --> 12:11.815
That's good work, Tim.

12:13.481 --> 12:15.240
Not bad either, Tony.

12:18.307 --> 12:21.193
Is it me or does he seem
a little more...? Human?

12:21.890 --> 12:24.591
Well, I was going to
say mellow, but yeah.

12:24.727 --> 12:25.808
Yeah...

12:26.138 --> 12:27.713
I think it's the moustache...

12:27.737 --> 12:30.328
Falling us into a
false sense of security.

12:35.099 --> 12:36.281
That's all of them.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.186
It appears one of them is missing.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.512
Missing what?

12:39.536 --> 12:41.027
One of the profiles.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.913
Alpha Bravo, one-zero-one-six.

12:44.077 --> 12:44.917
Targets?

12:44.941 --> 12:47.622
The binder they were kept in
listed them as potential targets.

12:47.646 --> 12:48.901
The Alpha Bravo designations.

12:48.925 --> 12:51.525
That's how we labeled pre-planned
artillery targets in the Corps.

12:51.549 --> 12:53.945
Maybe she was planning
on dropping bombs on them.

12:53.969 --> 12:55.840
What else was missing from
the lieutenant's place?

12:55.864 --> 12:57.673
I'm more concerned with
what was left, Gibbs.

12:57.697 --> 12:59.801
Money, jewelry. It's not
your typical burglary.

12:59.825 --> 13:01.850
This means they knew what
they were looking for.

13:02.325 --> 13:04.076
What can you tell me about these?

13:04.172 --> 13:05.585
She was profiling men.

13:05.609 --> 13:07.998
All the information gathered
was taken from public records.

13:08.022 --> 13:09.403
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

13:09.427 --> 13:12.154
- Well, that's an excellent question. I was wondering that myself.
- Abby...

13:12.178 --> 13:14.862
All of these were all
printed on the same printer.

13:14.886 --> 13:16.152
You want to know how I know?

13:16.176 --> 13:18.661
Newer models embed
micro codes in the print.

13:18.685 --> 13:21.243
It helps I.D. hardware to
counter money and documents.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.307
Wow. Good guess.

13:23.331 --> 13:26.831
It also means that the information
they represent is on her computer.

13:26.855 --> 13:28.931
- Show me.
- I'd love to.

13:28.955 --> 13:29.806
But I can't.

13:29.830 --> 13:30.912
Not yet.

13:32.238 --> 13:34.454
Bad guys smash up real good.

13:34.478 --> 13:36.446
- I'm still trying to recover the hard drives.
- How long?

13:36.470 --> 13:38.575
Did I mention bad guys
smash up real good?

13:38.599 --> 13:40.370
Like really, really good...

13:40.394 --> 13:41.227
Probably days.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.158
We don't have days, Abs.
Get McGee to help you.

13:43.182 --> 13:45.020
Wait. There's more.

13:45.044 --> 13:47.257
I ran the fingerprints from the SUV.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.471
- I matched all of them except three to a partial handprint.
- And?

13:51.495 --> 13:52.889
And I can say, with certainty,

13:52.913 --> 13:54.813
that the woman in the back of the SUV...

13:54.837 --> 13:56.421
- Was...
- Lieutenant Anne Sullivan.

13:56.445 --> 13:58.064
McGee already figured it out.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.653
Okay, did he tell you this?

14:02.042 --> 14:05.555
The partial handprint that I couldn't
match has a super-defined index finger.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.042
Which means it's not Sullivan's.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.398
It's the bad guy's.

14:08.422 --> 14:09.147
I'm running it now.

14:09.171 --> 14:11.089
His name is Justin Farris.

14:11.801 --> 14:12.746
McGee!

14:12.770 --> 14:13.538
Yep.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.699
- Is it just me or does he seem a little...
- Snitchy?

14:17.404 --> 14:19.011
That's close enough.

14:20.549 --> 14:23.374
It's got to be that damn moustache.

14:24.593 --> 14:27.562
I want agents knocking on
doors of anyone who met...

14:27.586 --> 14:29.136
, knows or sneezed

14:29.160 --> 14:31.906
on Farris in the last year, Mollvaney.

14:32.207 --> 14:33.207
Probie!

14:34.127 --> 14:35.965
I need you over here.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.908
Well, if they find anything, make
sure that you call Gibbs not me.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.367
Yes, the mustache is real.

14:43.554 --> 14:45.234
You got a hearing problem?

14:46.710 --> 14:48.670
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?

14:49.454 --> 14:51.618
There's no one else in the squad room.

14:53.188 --> 14:55.112
Well, I thought I
heard you say "probie."

14:55.136 --> 14:56.769
And since Agent Lee has been reassigned

14:56.793 --> 14:58.732
to the legal department,
I wasn't exactly sure

14:58.756 --> 15:00.536
who you were referring to.

15:00.891 --> 15:02.650
I get it. You don't like being...

15:02.674 --> 15:04.248
called probie anymore?

15:04.272 --> 15:05.844
Things change.

15:06.138 --> 15:09.085
Yes, I know. I used to be team leader...

15:09.109 --> 15:11.718
Pr-oh-ho-ho-bie.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.430
Temporary team leader.

15:15.522 --> 15:17.857
And that was only because Gibbs quit.

15:18.140 --> 15:20.003
You don't think I rate my own team?

15:20.027 --> 15:22.597
Wouldn't be here now if
you did, would you, DiNozzo?

15:25.577 --> 15:26.724
Yeah.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.162
Maybe you're right.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.773
If Gibbs asks, tell him
I went out for coffee.

15:33.482 --> 15:34.838
Tony, I didn't...

15:40.386 --> 15:41.475
McGee...

15:42.377 --> 15:45.469
how long have I been
an NCIS special agent?

15:46.616 --> 15:48.472
Almost 16 years.

15:48.496 --> 15:52.236
Want to take a wild guess what
my first partner still calls me?

16:07.744 --> 16:10.054
You've done it again, DiNozzo.

16:12.494 --> 16:14.602
I voluntarily turned myself in.

16:14.626 --> 16:17.718
I'm just trying to do the
right thing here, Agent Gibbs.

16:18.933 --> 16:19.471
Look...

16:19.495 --> 16:22.295
I'm admitting it, okay?
I stole the damn SUV.

16:22.319 --> 16:24.452
But I didn't kidnap anyone.

16:29.244 --> 16:30.844
How do you explain these?

16:31.297 --> 16:33.628
I didn't know that chick was
back there when I took it.

16:33.652 --> 16:36.877
Her name is Lieutenant Anne Sullivan!

16:36.901 --> 16:37.550
Where is she?!

16:37.574 --> 16:38.955
I told you, I don't know.

16:38.979 --> 16:41.800
Look, I am telling you I just
committed grand theft auto.

16:41.824 --> 16:44.322
Why the hell would I do that
if I wasn't telling the truth?

16:44.346 --> 16:46.882
To avoid kidnap and murder charges.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.542
Whoa. She's dead?

16:48.566 --> 16:50.112
No, no, she was alive

16:50.136 --> 16:52.038
and screaming in the back of the
SUV the last time I saw her...

16:52.062 --> 16:52.795
Screaming what?

16:52.819 --> 16:54.635
I don't know. It was something about...

16:54.659 --> 16:57.268
being singled out by some guy.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.819
I didn't exactly stick
around to find out, okay?

16:59.843 --> 17:02.076
I'm telling you, I didn't kill her.

17:07.412 --> 17:08.497
So what do you think?

17:08.521 --> 17:10.344
He might be telling the truth.

17:11.272 --> 17:12.653
I mean about the moustache?

17:12.676 --> 17:15.464
Oh, makes him look distinguished, yes?

17:15.488 --> 17:16.944
It's not Gibbs.

17:17.273 --> 17:18.396
People change.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.109
People maybe...

17:20.134 --> 17:20.969
not Gibbs.

17:20.992 --> 17:24.724
I knew it was too good to be true.
The door was open, engine running.

17:24.818 --> 17:27.412
Couldn't help myself, Agent Gibbs.

17:28.433 --> 17:29.558
Where?

17:29.629 --> 17:32.799
It was the Texaco
station on Wildwood Road.

17:32.993 --> 17:35.104
I'm telling you, the first
time I saw this chick...

17:35.128 --> 17:36.621
sorry, Lieutenant Sullivan,

17:36.645 --> 17:39.833
was in the rearview mirror when
she woke up and started screaming.

17:39.857 --> 17:40.784
Last time.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.721
In the lot where I dumped the ride.

17:42.745 --> 17:45.098
I even dialed 911.

17:45.122 --> 17:48.868
I mean, yeah, I hung up, but I dialed.
That's got to count for something, right?

17:52.680 --> 17:55.429
Wait, wait, wait.
There might have been...

17:55.453 --> 17:56.740
another car.

17:56.764 --> 17:59.841
There was a silver Honda Accord
that I thought might be tailing me.

17:59.865 --> 18:01.303
Thought somebody...

18:01.561 --> 18:04.156
saw me boost the SUV at the station.

18:06.146 --> 18:07.700
You see the driver?

18:07.724 --> 18:09.871
No. He was wearing a ball cap.

18:09.895 --> 18:13.750
I never got a good look at his face,
okay? But he must have followed me.

18:14.232 --> 18:16.080
That's who you should be looking for.

18:16.104 --> 18:18.641
- I'm not a kidnapper.
- No...

18:18.877 --> 18:22.548
you're just the dirtbag
that left her there to die.

18:26.853 --> 18:28.591
Ziva's running down the gas station
lead. 911 hang-up already checked out.

18:28.615 --> 18:32.123
911 hang-up already checked
out. Traced to Farris' cell.

18:32.723 --> 18:34.403
Ducky wants to see you.

18:34.466 --> 18:35.371
About what?

18:35.395 --> 18:37.320
Something about, uh...

18:37.344 --> 18:40.657
profiling Lieutenant Sullivan's
profile. Maybe you should ask him.

18:40.681 --> 18:42.631
- So you think Farris is innocent?
- I don't know.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.919
Have you checked the bloody
fingerprints Abby has against his yet?

18:47.041 --> 18:50.475
You are quite the
fascinating woman, my dear.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.686
Sadly, due to Darwinian evolution,

18:53.710 --> 18:58.383
men tend the cherish women's
bodies rather than their minds.

18:58.407 --> 18:59.614
I must admit,

18:59.638 --> 19:02.905
I sometimes fall prey to that myself.

19:02.929 --> 19:04.562
Thought you only talked to bodies.

19:04.586 --> 19:07.508
A lot has changed since you quit.

19:07.532 --> 19:11.193
Fortunately, one doesn't need a
body for a psychological autopsy

19:11.217 --> 19:15.197
which is what I'm doing here
on our missing Lieutenant.

19:15.329 --> 19:17.138
I heard you passed your test.

19:17.209 --> 19:20.649
Yes. The graduation
ceremony was very rewarding.

19:20.673 --> 19:22.548
All my friends were there.

19:23.979 --> 19:25.220
What do you got?

19:26.986 --> 19:28.306
Um, well,

19:28.330 --> 19:32.033
a sampling of the
Lieutenant's DVD collection-

19:32.057 --> 19:35.831
Under the Tuscan Sun, Sabrina,
Ghost, Fried Green Tomatoes.

19:35.855 --> 19:37.596
What Tony would classify

19:37.620 --> 19:39.121
as chick flicks.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.830
Yet they contrast vividly
with her choice in literature.

19:42.854 --> 19:45.726
Like our Timothy, she's quite the fan

19:45.750 --> 19:49.039
of the detective and the spy genres.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.589
A dissonance made even more interesting

19:51.613 --> 19:54.506
by these her fitness reports.

19:54.530 --> 19:59.050
They reveal a brilliant tactical mind
with little tolerance for failure.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.971
One who is... highly driven.

20:02.866 --> 20:04.773
She's well traveled...

20:04.797 --> 20:06.419
but notice this.

20:06.918 --> 20:07.737
Alone.

20:07.761 --> 20:08.638
Yes

20:08.662 --> 20:11.302
I imagine you know something about that.

20:12.093 --> 20:14.936
Are you going somewhere
with this, Doctor?

20:15.346 --> 20:16.121
Yes.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.761
This woman is a highly motivated loner

20:18.785 --> 20:21.458
with an odd desire for secrecy.

20:21.482 --> 20:23.882
These profiles that she keeps

20:23.906 --> 20:27.643
may indicate a need to
control her environment.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.555
And the people in it.

20:29.742 --> 20:31.442
But you don't know who they are.

20:31.484 --> 20:33.971
Well, this isn't an exact science.

20:33.995 --> 20:36.841
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs! Over here! Gibbs!

20:38.795 --> 20:41.767
Your new golden boy McGee, he was wrong.

20:41.791 --> 20:43.362
The partial handprint...

20:43.386 --> 20:45.242
Isn't Farris', boss.

20:45.266 --> 20:46.463
Whose is it?

20:46.534 --> 20:47.410
Well...

20:47.467 --> 20:49.060
That we don't know yet.

20:49.084 --> 20:50.727
But what that means is that...

20:50.751 --> 20:52.341
Somebody else was here.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.736
Farris claims he didn't
know Lieutenant Sullivan

21:03.760 --> 21:05.641
was in the vehicle when he stole it.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.874
When she started screaming, he
dumped it here with her still in it.

21:07.898 --> 21:09.737
Which means whoever kidnapped her

21:09.761 --> 21:12.170
must have followed Farris
to get the Lieutenant back.

21:12.194 --> 21:15.880
If he's telling the truth it still doesn't
explain why she was profiling people.

21:15.904 --> 21:18.927
Blackmail, espionage, assassination.

21:19.775 --> 21:21.711
All good reasons

21:21.735 --> 21:23.435
someone would want
to make her disappear.

21:23.459 --> 21:25.495
We could be missing something.

21:25.519 --> 21:27.480
Believe me, not from this angle.

21:29.751 --> 21:31.593
She could be a covert operative.

21:31.617 --> 21:34.953
She's a Navy computer geek who
worked on software for base housing.

21:34.977 --> 21:38.176
According to her coworkers,
she's a female version of McGee.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.200
Being a geek makes for a good cover.

21:40.224 --> 21:41.102
Cover for what?

21:41.126 --> 21:43.055
We're still trying to
figure that out, boss.

21:43.079 --> 21:45.179
You pull security tapes
from the gas station?

21:45.203 --> 21:47.376
There weren't any. The system's
been broken for a month.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.245
Tire marks from the lot
check out Farris' story-

21:49.269 --> 21:52.375
they're a match for a
factory-standard Honda Accord.

21:52.399 --> 21:54.266
Let's hope that Abby
and McGee had better luck

21:54.290 --> 21:55.290
come on.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.809
I wouldn't call this luck.

22:11.011 --> 22:12.507
Your computer's on fire.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.836
McGee, my baby's French-frying!

22:13.860 --> 22:15.777
Checking internal core temperature.

22:24.930 --> 22:27.308
That is so not funny, Gibbs.

22:27.819 --> 22:29.131
We must have nodded off.

22:29.155 --> 22:30.834
Tell me that you two have something.

22:30.858 --> 22:33.588
We have something, just
don't know what it is.

22:33.612 --> 22:35.288
Looks like a timetable for an operation.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.504
The problem is, the events
on the axis are encrypted.

22:38.604 --> 22:40.488
We been trying to crack it all night.

22:40.512 --> 22:41.907
Well, try harder, McGee.

22:41.931 --> 22:46.326
Chances of finding her alive drop
to almost zero after 48 hours.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.980
- Sorry. I'm sure you knew that, boss.
- Don't apologize, DiNozzo.

22:49.004 --> 22:50.320
Right. Sign of weakness.

22:50.344 --> 22:52.088
Not to mention annoying.

22:52.118 --> 22:54.702
We were able to pull some
programs off our directory.

22:54.726 --> 22:56.917
This is the only one that stands out.

22:57.629 --> 22:59.013
MorphPro.

22:59.127 --> 23:02.009
It's super-high-end
imaging software.

23:02.033 --> 23:04.901
It's unusual, because it
retails for over $5,000.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.817
Big bucks on a lieutenant's salary.

23:06.841 --> 23:07.775
What's it for?

23:07.799 --> 23:09.831
Morphing human features.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.460
Um, we pulled some test
runs out of her cache.

23:12.484 --> 23:13.966
Ah, yeah...

23:13.990 --> 23:16.112
this is like the end of
Saving Private Ryan you know,

23:16.136 --> 23:18.117
where Matt Damon morphs
into his older self.

23:18.141 --> 23:20.139
Anybody else get head-faked
by that? 'Cause...

23:20.163 --> 23:22.158
Tom Hanks was who I thought...

23:22.276 --> 23:25.212
I've seen software
like this before, Abby.

23:25.236 --> 23:28.347
Mossad used earlier versions
to age Nazi war criminals.

23:28.371 --> 23:30.510
It was a great asset
to hunting them down.

23:30.534 --> 23:34.237
So basically, what you're
saying to me is, we have nothing.

23:34.261 --> 23:35.469
Gibbs!

23:35.493 --> 23:38.767
Ziva's talking about Nazis. I
wouldn't exactly call Nazis nothing.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.421
- Abby...
- We have nothing.

23:40.445 --> 23:42.733
Until we crack her encryptions.

23:42.757 --> 23:43.950
You mean if.

23:43.974 --> 23:44.966
It's high-level,

23:44.990 --> 23:46.287
it's extremely sophisticated.

23:46.311 --> 23:48.758
Would her password help?

23:48.782 --> 23:50.908
Well, yeah, Ducky, but we don't have it.

23:50.932 --> 23:54.438
Yeah, well, I just spent a long
night in our lieutenant's head.

23:54.462 --> 23:56.318
I may be able to offer some suggestions.

23:56.342 --> 23:58.514
Try "Coral Gables."

24:01.585 --> 24:03.826
Uh, "Fiddlers green."

24:05.352 --> 24:06.635
"Hampton Inn."

24:07.290 --> 24:09.664
Nice try. Tony, Ziva, with me.

24:09.688 --> 24:11.667
"Spanish rose."

24:12.760 --> 24:13.449
Whoa!

24:13.473 --> 24:14.872
We're in.

24:15.651 --> 24:16.563
Ducky, that was...

24:16.587 --> 24:18.634
Mind-blowingly amazing.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.975
It's more of an art

24:20.999 --> 24:22.700
than a science.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.046
DUCKY: Oh...

24:26.095 --> 24:30.134
Lieutenant Sullivan was
indeed into targeting people.

24:30.183 --> 24:33.346
She was using all her military
knowledge and skills...

24:33.370 --> 24:35.633
to find a husband.

24:36.143 --> 24:39.775
Well, it looks like she found
herself a psycho instead...

24:40.432 --> 24:41.996
Dr. Mallard.

24:43.036 --> 24:44.850
Now that we have access to her files,

24:44.874 --> 24:47.258
we can see she was using MorphPro

24:47.282 --> 24:50.586
to predict the appearance
of her adult offspring.

24:50.782 --> 24:51.594
Creepy.

24:51.618 --> 24:53.312
No wonder she couldn't find a husband.

24:53.336 --> 24:56.744
You know, choosing someone to spend the
rest of the your life with is not easy.

24:56.768 --> 24:59.294
Who wouldn't want to know
all the facts before deciding?

24:59.318 --> 25:00.774
Isn't that what dating's all about?

25:00.798 --> 25:03.284
Yeah, you should try
that sometime, McGee.

25:03.449 --> 25:06.550
Gee, I wonder what would
happen if you two hooked up.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.756
Guys, meet your love child.

25:18.363 --> 25:20.375
Do Gibbs and the director.

25:25.287 --> 25:26.519
Hmm.

25:26.543 --> 25:28.831
Now, that's not a bad combination.

25:28.855 --> 25:30.959
Even with Gibbs as her
father, I'd date her.

25:30.983 --> 25:33.427
Never more than once, DiNozzo.

25:34.128 --> 25:35.368
Aw, Aw...

25:35.626 --> 25:37.803
you and the director
make nice Gibblets, Gibbs.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.603
McGee, pull up that Web site.

25:39.627 --> 25:41.535
While you three were
playing, Abby found out

25:41.559 --> 25:44.202
where our lieutenant was
the day she was abducted.

25:44.226 --> 25:45.290
Speed dating?

25:45.314 --> 25:47.153
There was an e-mail
invitation on her computer.

25:47.177 --> 25:49.853
It's a three-day event, and she
went missing after the first day.

25:49.877 --> 25:51.924
Gas station where Farris stole her SUV

25:51.948 --> 25:53.682
was two blocks from
the hotel hosting it.

25:53.706 --> 25:56.977
So she wasn't screaming about
being singled out by a guy.

25:57.005 --> 25:58.637
She was talking about this.

25:58.661 --> 25:59.915
I've heard of VSO.

25:59.939 --> 26:02.661
Apparently, they have
an 85% success rate.

26:02.685 --> 26:03.896
For what?

26:04.054 --> 26:04.758
For marriages.

26:04.782 --> 26:06.392
What about kidnappings, McGee?

26:06.416 --> 26:08.895
I will work on getting a list
of clients attending the event.

26:08.919 --> 26:10.130
I tried it.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.469
Their lawyers say that Virginia's
Singled Out is a confidential service,

26:13.493 --> 26:15.965
so they keep their client
list under lock and key.

26:15.989 --> 26:18.634
- Warrant. On it, boss.
- Not enough time, it ends tonight.

26:18.658 --> 26:20.610
I can't tell you who is there...

26:20.634 --> 26:23.279
but I can tell you that it's
the same guys from Sunday night.

26:23.303 --> 26:24.461
You want to know how I know?

26:24.485 --> 26:29.657
VSO is designed to introduce successful
men to a wide assortment of eligible women.

26:29.681 --> 26:32.961
Each night brings the promise
of romance and a chance

26:32.985 --> 26:34.949
of finding your soul mate.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.020
Or so I've heard.

26:38.549 --> 26:40.326
Okay, you know what, I...

26:40.894 --> 26:43.373
I thought about going to one, one time.

26:43.397 --> 26:46.243
After this is over, you and I
are gonna have a little talk.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.914
So...

26:47.938 --> 26:51.188
the men remain the same, but
the women change every night.

26:51.212 --> 26:52.662
Hey, we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.

26:52.686 --> 26:57.339
So, Ziva, you still think being
a geek makes for a good cover?

26:59.308 --> 27:00.847
You sure about this?

27:00.871 --> 27:03.391
Oh, absolutely.

27:03.415 --> 27:06.521
We have created an image

27:06.815 --> 27:09.864
of Lieutenant Sullivan's type.

27:09.888 --> 27:12.342
Hopefully, the similarities with trigger

27:12.366 --> 27:14.945
a visceral response in our kidnapper.

27:14.969 --> 27:17.171
Do you really think he'll come
back for another woman, Ducky?

27:17.195 --> 27:20.667
No, no, no, no. I think he'll
come back to avoid suspicion.

27:20.691 --> 27:23.246
I doubt you'll be in any kind of danger.

27:23.302 --> 27:25.677
Video surveillance glasses.

27:30.174 --> 27:31.662
Good work, McGee!

27:31.686 --> 27:33.337
I look like a dork.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.102
Yeah, that's the point.

27:35.633 --> 27:38.454
And this is a portable
fingerprint scanner, it's wireless.

27:38.478 --> 27:42.680
We'll know within a matter of seconds if the prints
you collect match our mystery print from the SUV.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.802
All you have to do is get each dater

27:44.826 --> 27:48.172
to press his right index finger here.

27:48.196 --> 27:50.438
Really. Is that all, Abby?

27:50.462 --> 27:52.146
How do you suggest I do that?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.861
Improvise. You'll figure it out.

27:53.885 --> 27:58.909
Our priority is I.D.'ing the members and finding
out which one drives a silver Honda Accord.

27:58.933 --> 27:59.766
Questions?

27:59.790 --> 28:01.387
Uh, just one.

28:01.411 --> 28:04.699
Can anyone please explain
what... speed dating is?

28:10.611 --> 28:12.467
90-second dates?

28:12.639 --> 28:14.271
I thought you were kidding me, Gibbs.

28:14.295 --> 28:17.714
You'll do fine, Ziva. I had
marriages shorter than that.

28:18.012 --> 28:20.069
I'm starting to understand why.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.712
Tony, sit-rep.

28:21.736 --> 28:23.876
No silver Accord in
the parking structure.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.185
Our girl is looking
a little nervous now.

28:26.219 --> 28:28.054
I think we found her kryptonite.

28:28.211 --> 28:31.554
Our big bad spy doesn't do geek.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.164
Did he just say "Greek"?

28:33.188 --> 28:34.511
How about both of you...

28:34.535 --> 28:35.929
shut up.

28:36.324 --> 28:37.380
Okay, daters,

28:37.404 --> 28:39.912
we've got a really full house
tonight, so please remember,

28:39.936 --> 28:41.151
be courteous to each other,

28:41.175 --> 28:43.103
and move at the sound of the chime

28:43.127 --> 28:45.289
please begin now.

28:46.195 --> 28:47.374
Hey, Natalie.

28:47.398 --> 28:48.685
I'm Larry.

28:49.116 --> 28:51.512
Hi. Uh, last name?

28:51.536 --> 28:53.342
Uh, West.

28:53.679 --> 28:55.632
Uh, banker by trade...

28:55.656 --> 28:57.160
but my passion...

28:57.184 --> 28:59.515
happens to be astronomy.

28:59.665 --> 29:03.217
Um, wh-why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself.

29:04.296 --> 29:05.367
I like...

29:05.391 --> 29:07.197
- computers.
- Mm-hmm.

29:07.271 --> 29:08.504
And...

29:08.920 --> 29:10.294
that stuff

29:10.318 --> 29:12.642
you do with the yarn.

29:12.666 --> 29:14.489
- Knitting?
- Yes!

29:14.513 --> 29:15.652
That's it.

29:16.451 --> 29:19.499
Has anyone ever told you
you're very attractive, Natalie?

29:19.523 --> 29:20.855
My brother.

29:20.879 --> 29:22.120
That's...

29:22.515 --> 29:23.715
interesting.

29:23.739 --> 29:25.687
Get his prints, Ziva.

29:25.902 --> 29:27.297
You know, I feel...

29:27.321 --> 29:30.182
Unit face is up. Just
getting his print now.

29:30.206 --> 29:31.416
ZIVA: With you, Gary.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.640
- Larry.
- Oh.

29:32.664 --> 29:34.031
What do you got in your hand there?

29:34.055 --> 29:35.122
I- It's called a mood scanner.

29:35.146 --> 29:36.022
- See?
- Oh.

29:36.046 --> 29:37.393
Let's me know if you're in the mood.

29:37.417 --> 29:41.322
Oh, very New Age-I like that.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.074
There's something about your eyes.

29:44.109 --> 29:45.900
I get that a lot.

29:46.007 --> 29:47.546
It's allergies.

29:48.713 --> 29:50.411
What kind of car do you drive?

29:50.435 --> 29:51.909
Does it really matter?

29:51.933 --> 29:54.811
Well, cars get me extremely

29:54.835 --> 29:55.957
hot...

29:55.981 --> 29:57.171
Larry.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.571
I drive...

29:58.595 --> 29:59.799
a Porch.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.699
- You mean a Porsche.
- Yeah.

30:02.723 --> 30:04.060
It's in the shop.

30:04.084 --> 30:05.944
That's a nice... car.

30:05.968 --> 30:08.176
We're oh for one.

30:08.326 --> 30:11.154
- 24 more guys to go.
- He's clean, Ziva.

30:11.178 --> 30:13.668
Yeah, well, you didn't
have to smell him, Gibbs.

30:13.692 --> 30:17.077
And do turn up the charm,
Ziva David, you're a geek,

30:17.101 --> 30:19.098
not mentally deranged.

31:04.346 --> 31:05.748
Get you another one, sir?

31:05.772 --> 31:07.379
Ah. Uh...

31:07.403 --> 31:09.112
Yeah, sure. Why not? Thanks...

31:09.136 --> 31:10.205
Graham.

31:12.502 --> 31:14.682
You with the speed dating party, sir?

31:15.307 --> 31:16.263
Why?

31:16.287 --> 31:18.259
Do I look like I need
that stuff to get a date?

31:18.283 --> 31:21.793
I have to ask, sir,
they get 15% off drinks.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.892
Just my luck.

31:24.318 --> 31:25.540
I'm...

31:25.564 --> 31:27.799
just waiting for a friend.

31:28.424 --> 31:30.140
Met her online last month...

31:30.164 --> 31:32.618
she was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

31:32.698 --> 31:34.292
Want to see a picture?

31:37.810 --> 31:39.115
Recognize her?

31:40.425 --> 31:42.126
Dirty vodka martini.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.348
She's a regular.

31:44.372 --> 31:47.016
See her on... Sunday afternoon.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.111
Really?

31:48.587 --> 31:50.811
Was she here alone or with someone?

31:50.835 --> 31:53.426
She was with the speed dating party.

31:53.450 --> 31:56.411
Couple guys were buying
drinks for her afterwards.

31:56.435 --> 31:58.644
- You know how that goes.
- Yeah.

31:58.801 --> 32:00.066
Yeah.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.901
Any of those McFisters here now?

32:03.872 --> 32:04.604
That's one of them.

32:04.628 --> 32:05.332
Over there.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.377
The, uh, gentleman with the glasses

32:07.401 --> 32:09.462
across from the nerdy-looking girl.

32:09.486 --> 32:11.022
Yeah. Thank you.

32:11.765 --> 32:12.965
Did you get that, boss?

32:12.989 --> 32:14.471
Yeah. Got It.

32:14.495 --> 32:18.004
I need a print on this guy.
And you are out of time, Ziva.

32:18.028 --> 32:20.438
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

32:20.653 --> 32:23.006
I think there's something spiritual

32:23.030 --> 32:24.688
about glass.

32:24.712 --> 32:26.746
Hot molten, silicate...

32:26.770 --> 32:29.440
- shaping it...
- You know, I-I feel a...

32:29.464 --> 32:30.969
an attraction between us, Calvin.

32:30.993 --> 32:33.124
- Really?
- Yes, something animal, you know?

32:33.148 --> 32:34.413
Something, uh...

32:34.437 --> 32:35.162
primal.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.187
Uh... okay.

32:37.211 --> 32:38.965
And time.

32:38.989 --> 32:40.442
Print didn't scan.

32:40.466 --> 32:42.055
Ziva, we still need his print.

32:42.079 --> 32:44.668
Oh, we did get a hit on his name.

32:44.784 --> 32:50.131
Calvin Hooper reported silver Honda
Accord stolen Sunday night in Fairfax.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.429
- Could have been the one following Farris.
- Tony...

32:52.453 --> 32:54.747
take him down, quietly.

32:56.019 --> 32:58.118
Intercepting now, boss.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.432
Would you like to get
a bite to eat, Calvin?

33:02.456 --> 33:04.494
Uh... you mean... together?

33:04.518 --> 33:05.526
Of course.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.967
Uh... well, sure.

33:06.991 --> 33:08.479
I'd love to.

33:08.503 --> 33:11.558
Or let's just skip the dinner

33:11.582 --> 33:14.530
and go straight for dessert.

33:14.824 --> 33:17.137
You know, this kind of
thing never happens to me.

33:17.161 --> 33:17.464
Oh!

33:17.488 --> 33:19.498
- Calvin Hooper?
- Yes?

33:20.117 --> 33:20.835
Huh?

33:20.859 --> 33:21.803
Remove your hand

33:21.827 --> 33:23.544
or I will rip your arm off

33:23.568 --> 33:25.203
and beat you to death with it.

33:25.227 --> 33:26.273
Um..

33:27.388 --> 33:29.002
It's not a match.

33:29.124 --> 33:30.177
What?

33:31.464 --> 33:32.391
Run it again.

33:32.415 --> 33:33.998
Boss, he's not our guy.

33:44.765 --> 33:46.895
But but you have no right to arrest me.

33:46.919 --> 33:48.451
You're not under arrest, Calvin.

33:48.475 --> 33:49.636
Yet.

33:50.823 --> 33:51.612
We just...

33:51.636 --> 33:52.803
want to clear up a few things.

33:52.827 --> 33:54.722
No one read me my Miranda rights.

33:54.746 --> 33:56.396
That's because you're not under arrest.

33:56.420 --> 33:58.294
- Yet.
- Ziva!

33:58.321 --> 33:59.706
Sorry.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.092
You should be proud of him.

34:04.116 --> 34:05.486
DiNozzo?

34:05.722 --> 34:08.407
When you left, there
were some rocky moments.

34:08.431 --> 34:10.387
He really held the team together.

34:10.411 --> 34:12.415
It's what I trained him to do.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.952
I just thought you should
know he excelled at it.

34:17.181 --> 34:19.275
Then give him his own team, Jen.

34:20.527 --> 34:21.777
You think he's ready?

34:21.802 --> 34:23.918
I wouldn't have quit if he wasn't.

34:24.132 --> 34:25.473
You should tell him that.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.123
Oh, trust me.

34:27.147 --> 34:30.897
When DiNozzo thinks he's ready for
his own team, you'll know about it.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.989
Hell, the whole world
will know about it.

34:39.139 --> 34:41.650
So you reported your
car stolen Sunday night.

34:41.675 --> 34:44.815
Yes. Is that some kind of crime?

34:44.840 --> 34:46.577
No. Of course not.

34:46.850 --> 34:47.793
However...

34:47.818 --> 34:51.021
- filing a false police report...
- Crime!

34:51.993 --> 34:54.435
I think I want a lawyer now.

34:54.458 --> 34:57.143
What part of "You're not under
arrest" don't you get, Calvin?

34:57.168 --> 34:58.163
So I...

34:58.187 --> 35:00.162
I'm free to go here at any time?

35:00.186 --> 35:01.426
Sure.

35:04.716 --> 35:06.518
Unless we charge you with a crime.

35:06.992 --> 35:08.420
See, the thing is, Cal...

35:08.444 --> 35:09.979
Can I call you Cal?

35:10.086 --> 35:13.361
Arresting you means
more paperwork for me.

35:13.795 --> 35:14.884
So...

35:14.933 --> 35:16.746
what I need from you

35:16.774 --> 35:18.258
is the truth.

35:19.388 --> 35:21.100
But my car really was stolen.

35:21.124 --> 35:22.447
Which sucks for you.

35:22.471 --> 35:26.700
Unfortunately, you reported it
stolen from your home in Fairfax.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.540
Speed dating is a three-day event.

35:28.564 --> 35:31.057
You stayed at the Belmar every night.

35:31.081 --> 35:32.455
You paid cash up front.

35:32.479 --> 35:34.339
Which was wise,

35:34.363 --> 35:37.986
considering that you're married and
attending a speed dating service.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.153
I'm calling his wife.

35:39.177 --> 35:42.405
No, wait! Please.

35:42.822 --> 35:45.307
It wasn't stolen from my
house, but you can't... I...

35:45.331 --> 35:46.427
She...

35:47.031 --> 35:48.725
She'll find out.

35:49.501 --> 35:52.178
My wife is at her
sister's place in Jersey.

35:52.202 --> 35:54.346
- They just had a baby.
- Oh.

35:54.370 --> 35:57.620
I've been married 18 years now.

35:58.012 --> 36:00.303
I was just trying to have a little fun.

36:00.327 --> 36:01.574
Yeah...

36:02.351 --> 36:04.855
What we need to know
is where and when, Cal.

36:04.879 --> 36:07.095
The first day of the...

36:07.119 --> 36:08.356
event I...

36:08.380 --> 36:10.203
- struck out.
- Shocking.

36:10.227 --> 36:13.201
So I drove over to the
Texaco station around 6:00

36:13.225 --> 36:15.134
to get some cigarettes and wine...

36:15.158 --> 36:16.988
and I'm in the store...

36:17.012 --> 36:18.198
maybe a minute when I...

36:18.222 --> 36:21.342
I look out, and this guy
is driving away in my car.

36:21.366 --> 36:22.682
Please describe him.

36:22.706 --> 36:24.581
White, about your height.

36:24.605 --> 36:26.493
He was wearing a Chicago Cubs hat.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.932
And, really, you know, I
just got a glimpse of him.

36:28.956 --> 36:30.142
Not good enough.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.806
You grabbed my ass, Calvin.

36:31.830 --> 36:37.510
No! Hold on! Hold on! Just a second. Um... Just
gi-gi-gi-give me a second. Just a second. Uh...

36:37.534 --> 36:40.017
When I drove up, he, uh...
he was standing out front.

36:40.041 --> 36:42.405
And he... he was on the pay phone.

36:42.429 --> 36:44.983
And I swear, that's all I can remember.

36:45.414 --> 36:47.969
Farris stole the lieutenant's
SUV with the lieutenant in it

36:47.993 --> 36:50.522
from the gas station at around 1800.

36:50.546 --> 36:52.809
And Cubs Hat steals Calvin's car

36:52.833 --> 36:55.139
at the same time, same
place, and follows him.

36:55.163 --> 36:57.102
Well, do you think they
were working together?

36:57.126 --> 36:58.219
It's possible.

36:58.243 --> 36:59.846
Except they weren't.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.180
Guy in the Cubby hat stopped
by to use the pay phone.

37:02.204 --> 37:04.082
Probably didn't want
to risk being overheard.

37:04.106 --> 37:06.891
Didn't figure on Farris
coming by and stealing his car.

37:06.915 --> 37:09.844
So he had to steal the
Accord to follow Farris.

37:09.868 --> 37:11.846
If he wanted the lieutenant back.

37:12.176 --> 37:15.098
Well, we got to get that pay
phone, find out who he was calling.

37:15.122 --> 37:17.324
McGee just brought it back.

37:17.359 --> 37:20.986
Feast your eyes on the
Western Electric 1D2,

37:21.010 --> 37:24.155
a piece of 1989's finest technology.

37:24.179 --> 37:28.659
The three latent prints that we took
off this phone matched our mystery print

37:28.683 --> 37:31.486
that we got from the
back of Sullivan's SUV.

37:34.172 --> 37:36.313
Cubs Hat is definitely our kidnapper.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.275
Did you run the calls made Sunday night?

37:38.299 --> 37:40.168
Did and done, Ziva.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.918
The traces just came in.

37:41.942 --> 37:45.019
There were only four calls made
from the pay phone that night.

37:45.043 --> 37:48.664
I mean, the pay phone industry has been
decimated by cell phone penetration.

37:48.688 --> 37:50.397
The only time you really use a pay phone

37:50.421 --> 37:52.953
would be on an airplane,
which is probably the reason

37:52.977 --> 37:54.658
that you can't use your
cell phone on an airplane.

37:54.682 --> 37:56.005
Abs, our missing lieutenant?

37:56.029 --> 37:57.739
Right. Um...

37:57.763 --> 38:00.516
Three of the calls were
to taxicab companies,

38:00.540 --> 38:03.940
and one was to a warehouse
in Fredericksburg.

38:03.964 --> 38:06.479
It's a rental space.
There's the address.

38:12.062 --> 38:13.372
Abby.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.012
Good job.

38:19.443 --> 38:23.934
Those are two words I will never
take for granted again, Bert.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.616
Clear.

38:56.694 --> 38:58.327
No one's here, boss.

38:58.448 --> 39:01.600
The lieutenant was here. It's her
purse. Military I.D. is still inside.

39:01.624 --> 39:03.379
- They knew we were coming.
- Maybe not, boss.

39:03.403 --> 39:05.310
You definitely need to check this out.

39:05.334 --> 39:06.905
Looks like a professional crew.

39:06.929 --> 39:09.066
Detailed itineraries, blueprints,

39:09.090 --> 39:10.737
and a scale model.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.129
It's for the Belmar Plaza Hotel.

39:14.153 --> 39:15.476
They planning a heist?

39:15.500 --> 39:17.281
Yeah. A big one.

39:17.305 --> 39:18.624
Coin convention and auction.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.983
They're planning on
hitting the hotel's vault.

39:21.007 --> 39:22.581
Does it say how?

39:22.990 --> 39:25.365
From inside. They're working the place.

39:25.389 --> 39:26.762
What does the lieutenant
have to do with this?

39:26.786 --> 39:30.623
She was dating one of them.
Alpha Bravo, one-zero-one-six.

39:30.647 --> 39:31.833
The missing profile.

39:31.857 --> 39:33.669
It says here he's a hotel bartender

39:33.693 --> 39:35.694
that lied to her about his entire past.

39:35.718 --> 39:37.659
She ran a background check on his cover.

39:37.683 --> 39:40.613
I can only imagine he panicked when
she started questioning him about it.

39:40.637 --> 39:42.568
We need to get to the hotel
before they hit the vault.

39:42.592 --> 39:44.989
They started four minutes ago. Come on.

40:15.861 --> 40:18.762
You really had us scared
there for a minute, Annie.

40:19.063 --> 40:21.276
We thought you might be FBI

40:21.527 --> 40:24.819
or a detective working
for the hotel. But...

40:24.894 --> 40:26.541
no cops.

40:27.173 --> 40:30.232
Looks like you were
telling me the truth.

40:31.488 --> 40:36.391
I'd wish you luck with the
whole husband thing, but...

40:37.056 --> 40:40.020
I don't think it's really
going to work out for you.

40:40.636 --> 40:43.288
I'm not exactly the marrying type.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.362
We're running eight
minutes behind schedule.

40:58.826 --> 41:00.332
Sanitize the warehouse.

41:00.356 --> 41:02.702
We meet at the airport in two hours.

41:06.943 --> 41:09.048
It's nothing personal, Annie.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.996
You just know too much.

41:11.249 --> 41:13.742
Don't move. Drop your weapon!

41:14.022 --> 41:16.083
Or, if you'd prefer, I
can shoot you in the spine.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.680
- Would you rather be a para.
- Or quadriplegic?

41:21.437 --> 41:22.754
NCIS!

41:22.778 --> 41:24.998
Put your hands where we can see them!

41:40.664 --> 41:42.376
Have a seat. You're
going to be all right.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.767
Thank you.

41:51.067 --> 41:53.977
You can't tell me you didn't
miss this when you were in Mexico.

41:55.175 --> 41:56.598
A couple of minutes.

41:57.912 --> 41:58.968
That's it?

42:00.555 --> 42:04.176
That's the difference between putting
the lieutenant in a body bag...

42:04.722 --> 42:06.319
or an ambulance.

42:14.705 --> 42:16.384
Come in, Tony.

42:19.822 --> 42:20.792
How did you know it was me?

42:20.816 --> 42:23.724
Because your deadline passed hours ago.

42:30.893 --> 42:32.303
I've made my decision.

42:32.327 --> 42:33.985
And I respect it.

42:34.383 --> 42:37.457
Sometimes I even wish I
made the same one myself.

42:38.039 --> 42:40.417
But I'm passing on the promotion, Jenny.

42:40.470 --> 42:41.456
I know.

42:41.480 --> 42:42.861
How can you know?

42:42.885 --> 42:45.486
I just made up my mind behind the door.

42:46.796 --> 42:48.295
To get here...

42:48.467 --> 42:50.233
in this office...

42:50.429 --> 42:52.682
especially as a woman?

42:52.904 --> 42:57.068
My career has been on the
fast track my entire life.

42:57.103 --> 42:58.998
And, between you and me?

42:59.343 --> 43:02.175
Sometimes I wish I had
taken it a little slower.

43:03.755 --> 43:05.257
So you're not disappointed?

43:05.281 --> 43:06.370
No.

43:07.010 --> 43:09.961
Actually, I'm feeling a
bit proud at the moment.

43:10.579 --> 43:11.579
Hmm.

43:13.730 --> 43:15.719
Go home and get some sleep.

43:19.539 --> 43:20.650
Listen...

43:20.980 --> 43:22.184
this wouldn't be

43:22.208 --> 43:26.523
the right time to bring up the
possibility of a performance award or...?

43:26.547 --> 43:28.316
Good night, Tony.

43:28.668 --> 43:30.023
Yeah, I didn't think so.

43:30.677 --> 43:31.842
Good night, Jenny.
