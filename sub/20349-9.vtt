WEBVTT

00:06.220 --> 00:09.310
I'm gonna turn Meemaw's house
into the Selina Meyer

00:09.310 --> 00:11.560
Presidential Birthplace
and Library!

00:11.560 --> 00:13.430
- I had to see you.
- Oh, please.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.930
Suddenly now white lives matter?

00:14.930 --> 00:17.520
- I mean...
- No, no. I'm sorry for how I behaved.

00:17.770 --> 00:19.770
What is the host
of Christmas past doing here?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.770
- Our interview.
- Congratulations, Jane.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.430
You wanna stick
with this book as is...

00:23.430 --> 00:24.810
- Yes.
- I completely understand.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.770
Great. We're just gonna
need our advance back.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.810
There was an advance?

00:28.060 --> 00:29.220
Conversion is about a commitment

00:29.220 --> 00:30.720
to the Jewish lifestyle.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.220
Oh, good. 'Cause all this
learning is giving me

00:32.220 --> 00:33.220
a yamaka-ache.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.470
I wanna write
a syndicated humor column.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.220
If I hear
of anything, I'll let you know.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.640
Thank you so much, Leon.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.640
I don't have my diary.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.220
Where do you think
you might have left it?

00:41.220 --> 00:43.560
Leon West's diary.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.970
What?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.100 --> 00:55.970
You know how much I love
the size of your jet,

00:55.970 --> 00:57.890
and...
Oh, my God, what?

00:57.890 --> 01:00.810
What is this weather? Why doesn't
everybody just go to St. Bart's?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.970
I miss it already.
It was so romantic.

01:02.970 --> 01:05.470
Just the two of us.

01:05.470 --> 01:07.810
- And Gary.
- So passionate.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.060
It's just what I needed,
you know?

01:09.060 --> 01:10.930
That ocean air
and the crystal blue water.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.010
Oh, and not to mention
the topless beach.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.720
I didn't see anything.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.770
Next time, I wanna stay longer.
Hello, ma'am.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.010
- Hello, Marjorie.
- I'm sorry to be so hysterical,

01:19.010 --> 01:21.100
- but we have a situation.
- What are you talking about?

01:21.100 --> 01:24.100
Catherine's on bed rest. She's been
diagnosed with an incompetent cervix.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.930
Well, why should her cervix be any
different than the rest of her?

01:26.930 --> 01:28.560
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Jaffar.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.180
Before you even ask, we have
taken a break from sex,

01:31.180 --> 01:32.680
specifically penetrative sex.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.470
- She has a penis?
- I don't know.

01:34.470 --> 01:36.180
Honey, what are you doing here?

01:36.180 --> 01:37.770
Well, yeah, I'm on bed rest

01:37.770 --> 01:40.010
so that the stitches don't
get ripped out of my cervix.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.430
Oh, my gosh.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.180
Well, this isn't bed rest,
this is couch rest.

01:44.180 --> 01:47.140
Did you put a towel
or anything underneath her?

01:47.140 --> 01:49.470
Because, girls, this is
imported French linen.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.930
- Maybe a waterproof tarp.
- Yes, actually,

01:51.930 --> 01:54.140
or even a garbage bag,
you know, in case she leaks.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.560
Special delivery! Advance copies.
Really?!

01:56.560 --> 01:58.560
- My book, my book, my book!
- Fresh off the presses.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.180
- Finally getting paid.
- Well, we'll see.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.770
- No!
- Yeah.

02:02.770 --> 02:04.970
- Look how pretty!
- Oh, the prettiest!

02:04.970 --> 02:07.220
- First Woman."
- Yeah.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.259
You could get murdered in my country
for saying something like that.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.889
- It's a bit of a pun.
- No, it's not.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.390
There's a typo
on the first page.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.720
- What?
- The first sentence.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.850
"From the moment I entered
the the White House."

02:15.850 --> 02:17.470
- Is that a pun?
- Well, that's on you, Amy,

02:17.470 --> 02:19.060
because you were
in charge of the book.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.680
- That's copy editing.
- Congratulations again, Amy.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.890
Richard! So glad to see you.
I missed you.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.810
Ah, welcome back, ma'am. Also,
Ambassador, ahlan wa sahlan.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.930
Now that's a pun!

02:29.930 --> 02:32.060
Ma'am, you are confirmed
for tomorrow night

02:32.060 --> 02:33.890
for "The Tonight Show"
to kick off the book tour.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.640
- Yeah.
- Which, again, is tomorrow night,

02:35.640 --> 02:37.430
- not tonight, despite the title.
- Okay.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.470
And you're doing the "Today"
show one week from yesterday.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.970
Wow, that smells good.
What is that?

02:40.970 --> 02:42.770
Oh, it's Catherine's
uterine tea.

02:42.770 --> 02:44.770
Yeah, it's a broth
of red raspberry leaf,

02:44.770 --> 02:46.890
black haw,
and false unicorn root.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.720
I hope that's going
in your mouth.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.180
Whatever happened to half a bottle of
red wine and three Virginia Slims?

02:51.180 --> 02:53.930
Ma'am, the producer of "The Tonight
Show" thought it would be fun if...

02:53.930 --> 02:55.770
No, you know what?
Nothing's fun on that show.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.600
I need to go and unpack.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.600
- Good night, ma'am.
- What? I'm not on bed rest.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.430
- My cervix is as tight as a snare drum.
- Oh, yes, it is.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.890
I'm not mentioned
in this book until page 134.

03:05.890 --> 03:08.890
I once dry-shaved
that woman's legs

03:08.890 --> 03:10.810
under her desk
during a cabinet meeting.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.140
Yeah, I'm not in there till
213, and I wrote the book.

03:13.140 --> 03:16.470
Ooh, page 93, suckers!

03:16.470 --> 03:21.520
"As Gary poured my tea, I realized the
hostages..." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.220
Oh, yes! How about you, Richard?

03:23.220 --> 03:25.220
- Did you make the book?
- Just the dedication.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.350
Congressman,
I put up all your flyers.

03:27.350 --> 03:28.560
Ooh, hey, fantastic...

03:28.560 --> 03:31.310
Oh, God damn it,
this office sucks my nard!

03:31.310 --> 03:34.640
A punishment from Congressman Furlong
and the speaker and the president.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.850
An astonishing
bipartisan agreement.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.850
Some interesting
reading arrived.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.140
- No such thing.
- Well, President Meyer's book.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.770
- Take a look.
- All right, let's see if I'm in here.

03:43.770 --> 03:46.930
- Jordan, jobs...
- Try Ryan.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.560
I know, Kent.
I was looking up jobs

03:48.560 --> 03:50.430
because they're important
to the American people.

03:50.430 --> 03:55.640
- R-Y-A...
- I know how to spell my last name, Kent.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.890
Are you fucking kidding?
I'm not in here.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.100
I ruined her administration,
like, four times.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.680
You'd think that'd count
for something.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.350
- Are you in here?
- 12 mentions. Adequate.

04:04.350 --> 04:05.890
Jonah, I just saw
the latest polls.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.640
The shutdown really hurt you
in Massachusetts' anus.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.520
AKA New Hampshire.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.100
You're only up by five points

04:12.100 --> 04:13.680
in your reelection against
Selectman Di Vicentis

04:13.680 --> 04:15.180
when you should be
up by 20 points.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.180
Whoa, I'm only up five
on Skeevy Deevy?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.930
I went to summer camp
with that dude

04:18.930 --> 04:21.220
and he was too afraid to get changed
in front of the other boys.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.220
- I thought that was you.
- No, I'm pretty sure it was him.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.850
It was you. - How do you know,
Kent? Were you at that summer camp?

04:26.850 --> 04:28.810
- Ah, there he is.
- Oh, hello, sir.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.220
- God!
- Jonah, my boy, I've come to say farewell.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.930
I'm pulling
all my financial support...

04:32.930 --> 04:35.140
The PACs, the reelection
committees, everything.

04:35.140 --> 04:38.220
I suppose I should've hired some
goons to kick the shit out of you,

04:38.220 --> 04:39.810
but you're dating
my daughter, so.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.350
- Dad.
- I know I've had some setbacks...

04:41.350 --> 04:42.560
No, no, don't take it so hard!

04:42.560 --> 04:44.350
Come on, Shawnee, let's boogie.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.720
No, you don't tell me
what to do.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.560
I'm not one of
your precious inmates.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.680
- I'm staying with Jonah.
- You are?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.810
- Are you pregnant?
- No, I'm not pregnant.

04:51.810 --> 04:55.140
Oh, thank God. I thought we'd
wait till we bought a house.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.680
If you stay with him,
you're cut off.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.430
- Okay.
- If you change your mind before dinner,

04:59.430 --> 05:01.430
we're having Peking Gourmet.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.770
I'm not coming, but order me some
slippery shrimp just in case.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.720
Babe, did you give up
your inheritance for me?

05:06.720 --> 05:09.260
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I still have my trust.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.680
- Oh, money!
- We're moving the wedding up.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.560
Just as soon as you
finish your conversion.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.720
- Mazel tov.
- Oh, thanks, Kent.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.100
God... motherfucker!

05:20.100 --> 05:22.220
Okay, I'm gonna get you
a bike helmet.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.060
I don't need a bike helmet!

05:25.060 --> 05:27.140
God damn it, ow!

05:27.140 --> 05:30.470
As you may have heard,
today marks my departure

05:30.470 --> 05:32.310
from the "CBS Morning Show
with Dan Egan."

05:32.310 --> 05:34.180
But you'll still be able
to find me weekly

05:34.180 --> 05:36.350
on our CBS digital platforms.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.100
- Podcast.
- What?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.430
Well, most importantly,
I hope that you've cherished...

05:40.430 --> 05:42.430
- our time together.
- I'm... I'm sorry, Danny.

05:42.430 --> 05:44.930
Stevie says we've gotta wrap it up.
Yeah.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.770
Okay, well, then to Brie.

05:48.770 --> 05:52.100
Thank you, Brie, you know, for
everything that we've shared,

05:52.100 --> 05:55.640
both on and off camera. - Oh.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.680
And to Jane, incredible.
Absolutely incredible.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.560
I mean, you've been with this
network for how many decades now?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.810
I mean, Jane...
I will always remember

06:03.810 --> 06:06.220
Jane covering the moon landing.

06:06.220 --> 06:08.140
I mean, I studied that footage.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.970
- That beautiful black and white stuff.
- Before me.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.100
- It was just fantast... well, regardless...
- Danny boy.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.010
- Jane, you are historic.
- Thank you.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.520
Be sure to join us
starting tomorrow

06:17.520 --> 06:20.770
for "CBS This Morning
with Jane and Brie."

06:20.770 --> 06:22.640
Girl power.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.010
We'll see... - We'll see
you in the tomorrow.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.970
And we're clear. Great job, everybody.
Good job, Jane.

06:28.970 --> 06:32.100
Okay, well, what do you say
we let bygones be bygones

06:32.100 --> 06:35.140
- and have some goodbye cake?
- I told them you didn't want cake.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.430
Oh, my God, I love this!

06:37.430 --> 06:40.770
They started demo at Mee-Maw's
for the birthplace and library,

06:40.770 --> 06:42.470
and the contractor sent me
this video link.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.970
Look at this.
I could watch this all day.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.260
- What?
- Nothing.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.470
Catherine, I can't repeat myself

06:47.470 --> 06:49.060
every five seconds
for your amusement.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.520
- Isn't that good?
- Ooh, "Tonight Show" dresses.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.260
- Look how pretty.
- You think it's too low-cut?

06:54.260 --> 06:55.810
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.310
Ma'am, I'm leaving.
Take good care of Catherine.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.060
- Who is she talking to?
- I don't know.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.850
- Ma'am, um...
- Ahem, yeah?

07:01.850 --> 07:06.560
The "Washington Post" is running
an exposé on your term in office.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.390
Is it bad? - Can I have a drink?
I feel a little dehydrated.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.470
It's kind of like the wave
in "The Perfect Storm,"

07:13.470 --> 07:17.010
except in this case,
the wave is made out of shit

07:17.010 --> 07:19.310
and our boat is also
made out of shit.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.180
It's Leon West.

07:21.180 --> 07:22.680
Fuck.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.060
What does it say?

07:24.060 --> 07:26.220
"Ignoring the advice
of experienced staffers,

07:26.220 --> 07:28.890
Meyer instead sought the counsel
of a high school drop-out,

07:28.890 --> 07:31.430
her personal trainer
and lover, Ray Whelan."

07:31.430 --> 07:33.100
He had a GED, guys.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.640
Oh, my God, they're
talking about my eye job?

07:35.640 --> 07:37.810
Chinese cover-up
over the tweet.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.180
This isn't an article,

07:39.180 --> 07:42.220
this is a gang bang
on a pinball machine!

07:42.220 --> 07:44.600
Who despises me like this?!

07:44.600 --> 07:46.890
Well, there's President
Montez, Tom James...

07:46.890 --> 07:48.430
The White House maids,
the steward.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.850
- White working class voters.
- Nobody!

07:50.850 --> 07:53.060
- Everybody loves you!
- Shut up!

07:53.060 --> 07:55.180
Can somebody carry me
to the bathroom?

07:55.180 --> 07:58.060
Ma'am, there's
a remote possibility...

07:58.060 --> 08:01.010
a while back, I was working on this
humor column... - No, don't, Mike.

08:01.010 --> 08:04.220
- Leon West has Mike's diary!
- Amy, you promised!

08:04.220 --> 08:07.180
What? What, Mike?

08:07.180 --> 08:11.520
What have you and your 47
tangled chromosomes done?!

08:11.520 --> 08:13.010
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.930
I should've gotten a diary
with a little lock on it,

08:14.930 --> 08:16.640
but I didn't wanna
lock myself out.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.100
- How long have you known about this?
- Since Alabama.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.520
But to be fair, we thought we
were on top of it. - We did, ma'am.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.890
Oh, really? Well, now
it's on top of you,

08:23.890 --> 08:27.600
it's knocked your teeth out, and
it's making sweet love to your face!

08:27.600 --> 08:30.220
We don't know
my diary is the source.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.850
Well, there's scans of it
on the WaPo website.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.970
- Oh, God.
- It's crystal clear.

08:33.970 --> 08:37.470
God, get out of here, you great
walrus Judas! - I'm gone, I'm gone.

08:37.470 --> 08:39.970
Okay, Amy, you have to call
my lawyer right now,

08:39.970 --> 08:41.309
my lawyers, the whole firm.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.059
All right, we have to
call Leon, too.

08:43.059 --> 08:45.350
And, Mike, where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

08:45.350 --> 08:47.470
You need to get in touch with
Leon right now. - Yes, ma'am.

08:47.470 --> 08:48.930
- Ooh.
- Ma'am, do you need to sit down?

08:48.930 --> 08:51.140
I just feel
a little woozy, okay?

08:51.140 --> 08:53.010
I've got stomach cramps. - Aw.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what are you drinking?

08:54.640 --> 08:56.890
This is Catherine's tea
for her underparts.

08:56.890 --> 08:59.970
What? It's the tea
for your underparts!

08:59.970 --> 09:03.520
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:05.930 --> 09:07.970
- What time is "The Tonight Show"?
- Call time is 3:30.

09:07.970 --> 09:10.060
I'm fine.
It's okay, I'm fine.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.180
- I'm...
- Ah, ah!

09:13.180 --> 09:15.640
Oh, dang!
What's up, white boys?

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
Yo, you guys ready
to drop that rock?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.770
- Gellardi, hit me, I'm open.
- What are you doing here, Congressman?

09:19.770 --> 09:22.810
I started up a basketball league
to endear myself to you assholes.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.520
We have a league. We play
here every Tuesday night.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.470
You guys can join my league.
How about that?

09:26.470 --> 09:28.970
- We don't want to.
- I don't give a fuck what you want!

09:28.970 --> 09:31.520
I have your ball,
so you have to join my league.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.060
I get first pick,
and I pick Graves.

09:34.060 --> 09:36.350
Oh, really?
Why are you picking me?

09:36.350 --> 09:38.060
Because you're so tall.

09:38.060 --> 09:42.180
Oh, God, who the fuck
invited Dikembe Mutomtard?

09:42.180 --> 09:44.520
A little word of advice,
Congressman, don't wear the shorts.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.680
Even Kobe Bryant wouldn't
rape you in those things.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.680
Oh, lookie here,
we got old Jesus

09:49.680 --> 09:52.180
with a camel toe and
his child molester goggles

09:52.180 --> 09:54.010
and the headband, of course,

09:54.010 --> 09:55.520
'cause you don't want the
sweat getting in your eyes

09:55.520 --> 09:57.220
when you're choking
them out afterwards.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.600
Congressman Ryan took our ball.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.720
- Oh, shut up, narc!
- You shut up!

10:00.720 --> 10:03.680
All right, Will, take the
ball and tell 'em why.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.100
Balls are the only thing keeping
me from choking on cocks.

10:06.100 --> 10:10.520
Without balls, I'd be swallowing
dicks whole just like Joey Chestnut.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.770
I'm sorry, Jonah,
but I'm gonna...

10:13.770 --> 10:17.350
Foul. Foul. - Doctor says I
gotta play 20 minutes every day,

10:17.350 --> 10:18.810
so get the fuck off our court.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.560
- Ball in.
- Let's go, Congressman.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.930
Wanna play a game of Horse?

10:21.930 --> 10:23.210
Yes, I would like that
very much.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.600
- Boom goes the dynamite.
- You're fired.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.350
Yes!

10:33.350 --> 10:36.060
Ma'am, "The Tonight Show" is
ripshit because you canceled.

10:36.060 --> 10:40.600
I just got a lecture from a 22-year-old
piss twat with a SUNY Binghamton degree

10:40.600 --> 10:42.390
who says that she thinks
that you chickened out

10:42.390 --> 10:43.720
because of the "Post" article.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.890
Just call her back
and rebook the whole thing.

10:45.890 --> 10:48.470
No, you have... - Okay, look, this
is all about damage control, Amy.

10:48.470 --> 10:53.720
My presidency just got caught with a
tranny hooker on Sunset Boulevard,

10:53.720 --> 10:56.430
and I have to make America think

10:56.430 --> 10:58.220
that I was just
giving her a ride home.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.180
- Right? Right.
- Very smart, ma'am.

11:00.180 --> 11:02.430
Actually, I did write a zinger for
"The Tonight Show" about Ray.

11:02.430 --> 11:08.100
"In sleeping with my trainer, I think you
could say I did not exercise good judgment."

11:08.100 --> 11:11.100
Okay, I am not gonna
say that joke to Johnny.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.770
- I mean...
- Uh, ma'am, Johnny...

11:12.770 --> 11:15.640
Ma'am, Leon West is here
for your double secret meeting.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.430
- Okay, you know what? Let's make him wait.
- Yeah!

11:19.430 --> 11:22.810
Okay. - And maybe give him some
of that lesbian cooze potion.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.600
Okay, I think all we have
is Diet Coke in the fridge.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.010
Okay, they should not be allowed
to call that stuff tea.

11:27.010 --> 11:29.220
That's what I think.

11:29.220 --> 11:33.600
You know what I think? You sound like
the world's gayest AM radio show.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.310
Now, guys, what is
our move with Leon?

11:37.310 --> 11:39.470
- Well, he really likes Amy.
- Amy who?

11:39.470 --> 11:41.810
Ew! No!

11:41.810 --> 11:44.560
She's all over his diary. She's
in every page. - You're kidding me.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.810
- No!
- Amy, Amy.

11:46.810 --> 11:48.930
Come on, nobody's asking you

11:48.930 --> 11:52.220
to engage in some sort
of human pleasurable activity.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.470
- I know that's not your bag.
- Okay.

11:54.470 --> 11:57.010
So, then what... - But perhaps maybe
you could flirt a little with him.

11:57.010 --> 11:59.430
I don't know if that's something
that you're actually able to do.

11:59.430 --> 12:03.600
Yes, of course,
I can be very flirtatious.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.180
Nope. - Ma'am, Leon West says he
knows you're just making him wait.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.850
- Okay, just send him in.
- Okay.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.640
One of these days,
she's gonna make that face

12:10.640 --> 12:12.970
and that eyeball of hers is gonna
pop out and shoot across the room.

12:12.970 --> 12:14.560
- Yeah. Boing!
- I know it.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.310
- Leon West, ma'am.
- Ah, Leon!

12:16.310 --> 12:18.850
Woodward minus Bernstein
plus Propecia.

12:18.850 --> 12:21.640
Ooh. - This entire
conversation is off the record.

12:21.640 --> 12:26.010
You are going to retract every
word this very nanosecond.

12:26.010 --> 12:29.010
Otherwise, I'm gonna sue you. - I'm
curious, you're gonna sue us for what?

12:29.010 --> 12:31.770
Because this is public
interest and fair use.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.850
Oh, I'd love to know
how my eye job...

12:33.850 --> 12:36.220
Which never happened. - ...which
never happened, by the way,

12:36.220 --> 12:37.470
is in the public interest.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.430
Now, I've got you on the hook

12:39.430 --> 12:41.350
for defamation, libel,

12:41.350 --> 12:45.560
and, if I remember my law school
tort professor correctly,

12:45.560 --> 12:47.720
and I do 'cause I slept
with him for two years...

12:47.720 --> 12:50.310
- Still off the record.
- Invasion of privacy.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.430
You can go ahead.
We're the "Washington Post"

12:52.430 --> 12:55.260
and we have been sued by better
terrible presidents than you.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.770
- Name one.
- Okay, you know what I want?

12:56.770 --> 12:59.220
I want this room, okay?
Everybody out.

12:59.220 --> 13:02.430
Are there any nibbles on
that Dave Barry... - Mike!

13:03.770 --> 13:06.060
- Get!
- Shh.

13:07.810 --> 13:09.220
What do you want?

13:10.640 --> 13:12.930
I think the Pulitzer
I'm going to get from this

13:12.930 --> 13:15.600
is good enough for me,
so good evening.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.060
- You can have Amy.
- Wait, I don't understand.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.350
You can have her.

13:24.060 --> 13:27.890
Probably better from behind,
though, you know...

13:32.060 --> 13:33.810
Good evening.

13:33.810 --> 13:36.390
Yeah, I don't blame you.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.720
Can you stop blowing
on my legs like that?

13:38.720 --> 13:41.640
- I'm drying the "glow-tion."
- Don't use the word "glow-tion."

13:41.640 --> 13:43.350
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

13:43.350 --> 13:46.640
Oh, my God, Amy, you are making
that terrible, terrible news face.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.350
You're gonna throw
your neck out, you know?

13:48.350 --> 13:49.930
What is it?
Is it Leon West?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.680
- Is it a second diary dump?
- Oh, it is beyond a dump.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.430
It is a toxic infant blowout

13:54.430 --> 13:57.430
out both diaper legs and
up the back of the onesie.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.930
Did they mention the antique egg
that we stole from the Oval?

13:59.930 --> 14:03.100
You stole it. - It's got the
terrorist drone assassination.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.600
Well, that sounds bad.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.260
- The DRA guy?
- Yeah, and the Chinese.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.520
It's got the soldier
whose leg you lost.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.220
Oh, my God, the lost leg. Ooh!

14:11.220 --> 14:13.430
Surrounded by Mike's
poorly drawn doodles of legs.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.520
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- It looks like arms.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.770
I'm better at arms. You should see the
page where I wrote about the arms dealer.

14:17.770 --> 14:19.260
Oh, my God!

14:19.260 --> 14:21.100
The Georgian election is here

14:21.100 --> 14:22.930
and all of that stuff
about Murman?!

14:22.930 --> 14:26.520
Mm-hmm. - Why do you work
for me, you stupid mustache?!

14:26.520 --> 14:29.220
We were telling so many lies, I had to
write them down to keep them straight.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.310
Any decent lawyer
would've told me to do that.

14:31.310 --> 14:34.060
Ma'am, they've got
the data breach.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.810
- No.
- They know that you 100% knew

14:36.810 --> 14:40.310
about the mining of those dead kids'
social security and medical data.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.810
I don't have a zinger
for that one.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.680
Well, I could go
to jail for that.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.810
- No.
- Well, I can't do the show.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.520
You guys have to
get me out of here.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.470
Madam President, we are all so
honored to have you on the show.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.310
I'm Bethany, and I'm gonna go over a few
rules of "What's in the Bag?" with you...

14:54.310 --> 14:56.720
Okay, look, Tiffany,
I am so happy to be here,

14:56.720 --> 14:59.010
but unfortunately, I've just
gotten this emergency call...

14:59.010 --> 15:00.970
Pregnant daughter. - ...from
my pregnant daughter...

15:00.970 --> 15:02.970
The baby is in distress. - ...and
her baby is in such distress.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.350
- Is my baby okay?
- Come on, guys, we gotta go!

15:05.350 --> 15:06.390
She's gonna love these.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.850
By the way, what is in the bag?

15:08.850 --> 15:12.010
- It's a copy of the president's book.
- Ha, that's good.

15:12.010 --> 15:15.850
I was a patsy, but to my knowledge,
this is just the tip of the iceberg.

15:15.850 --> 15:19.680
These revelations will continue to come
out in a steady drip, drip, drip...

15:19.680 --> 15:21.430
Balls. - ...like the
leaky prison faucet

15:21.430 --> 15:22.810
I was forced to drink from.

15:22.810 --> 15:24.520
Good evening, ma'am.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.560
- Finally got Catherine down.
- I could never get her down.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.180
She was always so scared
about monsters everywhere,

15:29.180 --> 15:33.220
you know, under her bed and behind
the curtain and in the closet.

15:33.220 --> 15:36.890
Although, actually, one time, Andrew did
hide one of his women in the closet,

15:36.890 --> 15:39.720
so she had reason
to be somewhat alarmed.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.850
- Why don't I join you in that nightcap?
- Uh, Gary?

15:42.850 --> 15:45.930
- I think I heard him leave.
- What? Oh, right.

15:45.930 --> 15:48.010
I don't think that
there are any clean glasses.

15:48.010 --> 15:51.310
- There's one here.
- Uh-huh, okay.

15:51.310 --> 15:52.850
You know, ma'am,

15:52.850 --> 15:54.720
something I've always
wanted to tell you.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.560
You know what I love most
about your daughter?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.970
What's going on
with the foundation?

15:58.970 --> 16:02.260
You know, I was thinking that I
might wanna become more involved.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.890
I could really use the cleansing
power of a charity right now.

16:05.890 --> 16:08.350
Well, it's been quite a year for
the Meyer Fund for Adult Literacy,

16:08.350 --> 16:10.430
AIDS, the Advancement
of Global Democracy,

16:10.430 --> 16:12.770
Military Family Assistance,
and Childhood Obesity.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.720
- AIDS in particular has had...
- Wait, wait, hang on a second.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.220
What is that you just... what was
the thing that you just said?

16:17.220 --> 16:20.140
Childhood obesity. You sent me an
email about it last month at 4:00 AM.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.140
I forgot. I was looking at
Catherine's baby pictures.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.260
I have to admit I was
skeptical about it at first,

16:25.260 --> 16:27.350
but the more I learned
about those kids,

16:27.350 --> 16:30.140
I started to see that the problems
are not just physical problems...

16:30.140 --> 16:33.770
Yeah. -...that come with obesity...
the cancer, the diabetes...

16:33.770 --> 16:36.390
But also the emotional
and psychological problems...

16:36.390 --> 16:39.140
- The body dysmorphia...
- Yeah. Hey, Jaffar, it's me.

16:39.140 --> 16:42.640
So we started an exciting new
program... - Can you come and get me?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.930
We get the kids out
10 minutes a day...

16:44.930 --> 16:47.220
- Yeah, in 10 minutes would be good.
- It is good.

16:47.220 --> 16:50.140
It is. It's a perfect amount of
time for a lot of these kids.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.680
From the moment
I have left office,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.680
it has been nothing
but a giant slalom

16:55.680 --> 16:57.930
down Mount McRimjob,
brown diamond.

16:57.930 --> 17:00.100
I know, but in my mind, you
have nothing to be ashamed of.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.260
You know, my uncle, he poisoned
an entire village with sarin gas.

17:03.260 --> 17:06.390
Ooh, that is worse. Thank you very
much for that. - Yeah, you're welcome.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.970
I just wish we could
leave this country forever.

17:08.970 --> 17:11.220
Why don't we, eni?

17:11.220 --> 17:13.060
I mean, you've got nothing here.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.640
- I've got Catherine, but, I mean...
- Let's just go.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
I've got a plane
that's fully fueled always

17:16.640 --> 17:20.310
- and ready to go at any moment.
- Why? Why is your plane always fueled?

17:20.310 --> 17:22.599
Well, you know, in case...

17:22.599 --> 17:24.970
Let's just say that
I've got some cousins...

17:24.970 --> 17:26.310
Yeah. - ...who
sometimes get very angry

17:26.310 --> 17:27.770
at some of your tall buildings.

17:30.010 --> 17:32.010
Oh, God, you're making
a joke, right?

17:32.010 --> 17:33.520
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.930
Dipshit Mike
and his shit-dip diary.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.640
"Amy committed perjury today,"

17:38.640 --> 17:40.850
written in crayon
and mustard stains.

17:40.850 --> 17:44.470
- You gonna hire a lawyer?
- No, I'm thinking of pleading guilty.

17:44.470 --> 17:46.970
I wouldn't mind a little time in
prison, get away from my wife,

17:46.970 --> 17:50.390
- spend time with guys who get it.
- Yeah, learn a trade.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.010
All right, I gotta get up early,

17:52.010 --> 17:54.770
yammer my case to
the morning TV yabbos.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.350
- No offense.
- Hey, none taken. Former yabbo.

17:57.350 --> 18:00.180
Bye, kids. - What about you?
What's next for the great Dan Egan?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.390
- Any job leads?
- I thought about teaching high school,

18:02.390 --> 18:04.640
but, I mean, girls these days
just can't keep a secret.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.720
- You see Jane's up to her old tricks?
- Mm-mm.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.350
Yeah, she's telling Page Six that
she and Brie are clam slamming.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.140
Vaginas are so gross.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.060
I wish I didn't have one.

18:13.060 --> 18:14.470
Sometimes I forget I do.

18:14.470 --> 18:15.850
Yeah, yeah, we all do.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.180
Get you one more of these?

18:17.180 --> 18:19.770
I gotta get up
in the morning, early,

18:19.770 --> 18:21.560
'cause Selina's...

18:21.560 --> 18:23.890
- Yeah, make it a double.
- Atta girl.

18:23.890 --> 18:25.890
So, we will go to Paris first.

18:25.890 --> 18:27.720
- Goody!
- We'll figure out where we wanna go next.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.100
Hey, listen, can you call somebody
to bring me some fresh towels?

18:30.100 --> 18:33.140
- More towels? How many towels are you...
- Yes, I need them.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.180
Breaking news from
the "Washington Post."

18:35.180 --> 18:37.470
Buried among
many new scandalous acts

18:37.470 --> 18:39.390
- from the Meyer Presidency...
- Oh, no.

18:39.390 --> 18:42.890
Comes the revelation that
it was President Selina Meyer

18:42.890 --> 18:45.390
and not President Laura Montez

18:45.390 --> 18:48.560
who negotiated with the Chinese
president to free Tibet.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.600
- Jaffar!
- Sources close to...

18:50.600 --> 18:52.310
- What is the matter? What's going on?
- No, no, look!

18:52.310 --> 18:55.140
They know!
They finally know it's me!

18:55.140 --> 18:57.180
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah!

18:57.180 --> 19:00.640
Well, the history books
are being rewritten,

19:00.640 --> 19:04.850
and this time, it's not Texas
saying Satan made fossils.

19:04.850 --> 19:06.220
Yes, he did.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.930
- What?
- Ma'am, it is everywhere!

19:07.930 --> 19:10.680
This is the best day we've had
since I started working for you.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.140
I guess it was actually good
I lost the diary.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.810
Ma'am, we're getting requests for
confirmation from all the big Tibetan papers,

19:15.810 --> 19:17.310
except for the "Lhasa
Express," though.

19:17.310 --> 19:18.600
They're playing
their usual games.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.010
- Well, whatever.
- This is amazing.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.100
Nobody is talking about
any of the other stuff!

19:22.100 --> 19:25.970
God bless the media and their "fly
hitting a windshield" attention span!

19:25.970 --> 19:29.390
I know! Leon West is on "CBS
This Morning" right now.

19:29.390 --> 19:31.260
Oh, my God,
put it on really quick.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.970
Even you would admit that
freeing Tibet from Chinese rule

19:34.970 --> 19:36.470
is a monumental achievement.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.390
- Yes, it was.
- No, that was a fluke.

19:38.390 --> 19:40.930
That was a success despite
an almost pathological level...

19:40.930 --> 19:44.260
President Meyer's discretion
speaks well of her. - Yeah!

19:44.260 --> 19:46.640
Take that cum shot
in all four eyes, Leon.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.310
You should've taken Amy
and walked away.

19:48.310 --> 19:49.770
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

19:49.770 --> 19:52.180
If she were a man, you would
call that confidence.

19:52.180 --> 19:54.770
Yeah, tell it, sister!
Kick him in the cunt.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.970
I adore Jane McCabe.

19:58.140 --> 20:00.520
A heroine for our times.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.260
Montez is not gonna be happy.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.140
It's gonna put a real turd
in her chalupa.

20:04.140 --> 20:06.180
Oh, we should get
Mexican for lunch.

20:06.180 --> 20:08.470
President Meyer's office. Yale
University president's office?

20:08.470 --> 20:11.520
Oh. - Okay, and she knows
what this is regarding, Yale?

20:11.520 --> 20:14.640
Give me that. I'm talking.
Hello, this is President Meyer.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.640
Jim!
How are you?

20:19.060 --> 20:20.470
Oh, absolutely.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.010
We'll have your office
get in touch with my office.

20:23.010 --> 20:25.220
We're very interested
in discussing that.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.310
You, too.
Bye-bye.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.470
Well?

20:29.470 --> 20:31.810
Guess who is interested,
all of a sudden,

20:31.810 --> 20:34.140
- in the Selina Meyer Presidential Library.
- Shut up!

20:34.140 --> 20:35.220
- Andrew.
- What?

20:35.220 --> 20:37.260
- Your ex.
- No. Yale!

20:37.260 --> 20:40.930
- I thought you went to Smith.
- No, it's in the book that you wrote.

20:40.930 --> 20:42.600
Right, right, right, right.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.770
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get upset!

20:44.770 --> 20:46.970
I'm so moved by this! - You just
started tearing down Mee-Maw's house.

20:46.970 --> 20:49.010
- Well, that's Catherine's problem.
- Okay.

20:49.010 --> 20:51.970
Hey, Kent, free at last,
free at last.

20:51.970 --> 20:54.010
I've been fired
three times in my life...

20:54.010 --> 20:57.010
From the US Postal Service
Office of Investigations,

20:57.010 --> 20:59.810
by the Seattle Seahawks,
and by Jonah Ryan.

20:59.810 --> 21:02.890
I cried each time.
This time, it was tears of joy.

21:02.890 --> 21:05.560
- Good for you.
- Well, good timing because we're in print

21:05.560 --> 21:07.100
as genius operators.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.520
You know, this could be
an opportunity.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.720
I might get
my teeth re-whitened.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.310
Maybe we could start
a new business,

21:11.310 --> 21:12.470
take our shit show on the road.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.680
Yeah, easier than explaining

21:13.680 --> 21:15.770
yards after the catch
to Steve Largent.

21:15.770 --> 21:19.220
If we do this, though,
one rule... no McLintock.

21:19.220 --> 21:20.680
No shit.
So, what do you think?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.680
The three Meyersketeers
hang a shingle?

21:22.680 --> 21:24.310
I am gonna bid you farewell

21:24.310 --> 21:26.180
because this face
belongs in broadcasting

21:26.180 --> 21:27.260
and I start a new gig tomorrow.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.220
Drinks are on you.
Bye.

21:29.220 --> 21:32.260
You'll be sorry. - I thought you
were taking the family to Italy.

21:32.260 --> 21:33.560
They're in Italy.

21:35.350 --> 21:36.930
Hey, wake up.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.470
Can you hear me?

21:38.470 --> 21:41.560
- There you go. Hi.
- Am I Jewish?

21:41.560 --> 21:43.770
Your circumcision
was a success, Mr. Ryan.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.350
If you notice any swelling,
let me know,

21:45.350 --> 21:47.140
and no erection for six weeks.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.010
Well, I don't know how
I'm not gonna get it hard

21:49.010 --> 21:51.390
when I'm talking about my hog
with some hot "shiska" nurse.

21:51.390 --> 21:54.390
I'm your doctor,
and it's shiksa.

21:54.390 --> 21:57.220
- I'll check on you later.
- I'm pretty sure it's "shiska."

21:57.220 --> 21:59.260
- I'm leaving.
- How are you doing?

21:59.260 --> 22:00.560
I don't know.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.430
Babe, so far, being Jewish
really sucks.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.310
Will you pass me one
of those ice packs, please?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.350
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

22:07.350 --> 22:10.010
At least your dick won't smell
like donkey pussy anymore.

22:10.010 --> 22:12.220
Oh, God, I told you
that was expired lube.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.560
Oh, and there's
someone here to see you.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.470
- Hello, Jonie.
- Ugh, fuck. Hello, Uncle Jeff.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.430
Now, why do you think I'm here?

22:19.430 --> 22:20.850
To wish me a speedy recovery?

22:20.850 --> 22:23.930
No, wishes belong
in the bottom of a well

22:23.930 --> 22:25.680
with unwanted girl children.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.100
Actually, I'm here to thank you.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.520
Well, fine, you're
welcome for whatever.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.430
For shitting
the urinal so badly,

22:33.430 --> 22:34.770
you made the Hindenburg
look like

22:34.770 --> 22:36.680
a normal,
on-time blimp landing.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.060
Uncle Jeff,
people loved the shutdown...

22:39.060 --> 22:43.970
Shut the fuck up,
you epileptic Picasso painting!

22:43.970 --> 22:45.720
Uh, you can't
talk to him like that.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.970
Uh, you can't
talk to him like that.

22:47.970 --> 22:50.140
Who is this
tranny knuckle-dragger?

22:50.140 --> 22:52.890
Somebody you hired to make
sure you don't get erections?

22:52.890 --> 22:55.640
That tranny knuckle-dragger
is my fiancée.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.640
- Jonah!
- Her name is Shawnee Tanz,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.890
and you will treat her
with respect.

22:59.890 --> 23:02.850
- Tanz as in Sherman Tanz?
- That's right. He's my father.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.220
Oh, royalty.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.470
Well, I suppose
I should say I'm sorry.

23:06.470 --> 23:09.890
Thank you. - Sorry you're even
related to that human melted candle

23:09.890 --> 23:12.390
who puts the Jew
in "why people hate Jews."

23:12.390 --> 23:15.100
Tell me this, did he
sell your training bras

23:15.100 --> 23:18.640
as cum rags to the sex
offenders in his prisons?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.260
Listen up, Ms. Tranz,

23:20.260 --> 23:23.310
as of today, Jonie here
is down three points

23:23.310 --> 23:25.640
to that wop wonder Di Vicentis,

23:25.640 --> 23:29.520
so I am pulling this creature
from the jizz lagoon

23:29.520 --> 23:32.310
right off the New Hampshire
congressional ballot

23:32.310 --> 23:34.930
and replacing him
with his cousin, Ezra.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.680
What... mm... what?

23:36.680 --> 23:40.350
Ezra has more raw political talent
in the tip of his rosy-head pecker

23:40.350 --> 23:43.350
than you have in this mangled
abortion coat hanger

23:43.350 --> 23:46.520
you should be ashamed
to call your body.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.770
The people of New Hampshire
are gonna be so grateful to me,

23:48.770 --> 23:50.430
I'm gonna be like
a disability check

23:50.430 --> 23:52.850
wrapped around a pack
of no-filter cigarettes.

23:52.850 --> 23:55.180
- See you around, Jonie.
- Wait, can he really do that?

23:55.180 --> 23:58.220
Take your name off the ballot? - Yeah,
he owns, like, all these old people.

23:58.220 --> 24:01.310
Jonah, I have been thinking,

24:01.310 --> 24:03.770
um, you know, I think I wanna
slow things down with us.

24:03.770 --> 24:06.850
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. My
teachers had to do that all the time.

24:06.850 --> 24:08.720
No, with us...
You and me.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.890
What?

24:15.560 --> 24:18.850
- She's dumping you!
- Shut the fuck up, Uncle Jeff.

24:18.850 --> 24:21.220
- She's not dumping me.
- Oh, no, I am.

24:21.220 --> 24:25.560
I've been having doubts
for a little while.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.100
Uncle Jeff, shut up!

24:27.100 --> 24:28.520
What do you mean a little while?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.220
What the fuck
does that even mean?

24:30.220 --> 24:32.520
Is that before or after
I scheduled the surgery

24:32.520 --> 24:35.010
to cut my dick off
so you could marry me?

24:36.520 --> 24:38.850
Uncle Jeff, come on!

24:38.850 --> 24:41.390
I'm so glad I came in person
and didn't call.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.260
Goodbye, Jonah.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.470
Sorry.

24:45.470 --> 24:47.680
- Come on, honey, I'll walk you out.
- Oh, that's nice of you.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.180
- Are you parked in the garage?
- Yeah, I'm just outside.

24:50.180 --> 24:53.640
Oh, that's... Shawnee, wait...

25:03.680 --> 25:06.060
Okay, come on.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.350
Ow! Nurse!

25:12.350 --> 25:14.720
Leon West just called
for the seventh time.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.260
He says he wants you to... - He wants
to gargle my nuts and tickle my taint?

25:18.260 --> 25:20.720
- Tell him to get in line.
- Oh, ma'am, the publisher said

25:20.720 --> 25:22.180
we're getting
some book reviews in.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.010
Oh, the "Lhasa Express"
gives it five namastes.

25:24.010 --> 25:26.100
- Now, what are you doing?
- Don't worry about it.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.890
They're ready for you, ma'am.
Oh.

25:27.890 --> 25:30.180
- That's Bethany.
- Okay, thank you, Tiffany.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.140
- I'm going!
- Knock 'em dead, ma'am.

25:32.140 --> 25:33.720
- Thank you!
- Have fun.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.350
How long have you been working
for "The Tonight Show"?

25:35.350 --> 25:37.970
- About a month.
- Hey, ma'am.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.060
Ma'am, Catherine's
in an ambulance.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.310
- She's having some bad bleeding.
- Oh, my God, on the couch?

25:42.310 --> 25:44.560
- Did they put the garbage bags down?
- I don't know.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.930
- Okay, and?
- One of us should go?

25:46.930 --> 25:48.310
Well, what are you
standing here for?

25:48.310 --> 25:50.140
- You're the donor.
- Oh, father.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.520
- Do you need to leave?
- Where do I stand?

25:52.520 --> 25:55.350
- Oh, right there on the mark.
- On the thing? Okay. Thank you.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.470
- Good luck, ma'am.
- Hi. How are you?

25:57.470 --> 26:00.600
The first woman to hold
the office of the president.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.180
If that's not enough,
she's written an autobiography...

26:03.180 --> 26:05.310
First Woman."

26:05.310 --> 26:07.430
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome...

26:07.430 --> 26:09.600
President
Selina Meyer! Selina!

26:09.600 --> 26:13.100
Hey! Ah! Whoo!
How about that?

26:13.100 --> 26:14.770
- Hello.
- Hey. Great.

26:14.770 --> 26:17.600
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you!

26:17.600 --> 26:19.560
How about this,
a real president!

26:19.560 --> 26:21.180
A real president.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.390
- Where to?
- 53rd and 3rd, please.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.770
Hi, there.
Welcome to "CBS This Ride."

26:31.770 --> 26:33.680
I'm your host, Dan Egan,

26:33.680 --> 26:35.680
- bringing you exclusive content...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.350
Off. - ...right here in
New York City Yellow Cabs.

26:37.350 --> 26:39.850
Sir, how do you... I can't
get the screen to go off.

26:39.850 --> 26:41.970
Come on, how the fuck
do you turn this thing off?!

26:41.970 --> 26:44.180
There's an off...
You see the off button?

26:44.180 --> 26:46.430
All right, you know what?
You know what?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.720
I wanna get out.
Shut the fuck up!

26:48.720 --> 26:50.390
Sir, can you calm down, please?

26:50.390 --> 26:52.720
Broadway is your scene,
Fringe Festival's in town.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.970
God damn it.
Ben, it's me.

26:55.970 --> 26:58.390
Hey, you gonna pay? I'm in.

26:58.390 --> 27:00.390
I did wanna clear the air
about one thing.

27:00.390 --> 27:02.890
Sure. - Earlier this week,
you were booked on the show.

27:02.890 --> 27:05.350
You had to cancel, which,
to us, is like, you know,

27:05.350 --> 27:07.520
she's the President
of the United... who cares?

27:07.520 --> 27:10.470
We're fine with it. You have so
many more important things to do...

27:10.470 --> 27:12.640
- Well, thank you.
- Than our stupid show

27:12.640 --> 27:14.720
that we put together with Scotch
tape here. - No, it's a great show.

27:14.720 --> 27:18.010
- No, I love this show.
- And then there was speculation

27:18.010 --> 27:21.100
that you did so
because you were embarrassed

27:21.100 --> 27:24.430
about some salacious news
stories about your trainer.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.470
Yes, in sleeping
with my trainer,

27:26.470 --> 27:30.220
I did not
exercise good judgment.

27:30.220 --> 27:31.890
Wow.

27:31.890 --> 27:33.560
Ha, ha, ha!

27:33.560 --> 27:35.220
Zinger!

27:35.220 --> 27:37.770
Actually, what I really
would love to talk about,

27:37.770 --> 27:39.770
um, is Tibet.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.390
- Yeah, absolutely, Madam President.
- The deal that we brokered.

27:41.390 --> 27:45.010
But before that, just in
honor of your new book...

27:45.010 --> 27:47.220
- Oh, sure.
- First Woman."

27:47.220 --> 27:49.390
Is that the final title
or are you, uh...? - Yeah.

27:49.390 --> 27:50.810
Oh, yeah, that... mm-hmm.

27:50.810 --> 27:53.600
- It's a little pun.
- It is a pun, kind of.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.140
By the way, this is
quite a photo on the cover.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.810
- It's really, really nice.
- Thank you.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.600
Do I need, like, special glasses

27:59.600 --> 28:01.970
- to be able to see this in focus?
- No, no!

28:01.970 --> 28:03.600
Or how does this work?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.100
It just came out today,
and we thought it would be fun,

28:06.100 --> 28:07.640
in honor of you canceling on us,

28:07.640 --> 28:09.810
to have some children
come out here.

28:09.810 --> 28:12.140
They'll read you some
of our favorite reviews

28:12.140 --> 28:13.520
- of your book.
- Oh, neat!

28:13.520 --> 28:15.060
Because as any parent knows,

28:15.060 --> 28:18.060
kids read the darndest
things off of cue cards.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.850
That's right. So, kids, could
you come out here, please?

28:20.850 --> 28:23.220
- Oh, so cute.
- Yeah, very cute.

28:23.220 --> 28:27.260
Starting up here, we've got
Ella, who is age nine.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.810
"'The New York Times' says,

28:28.810 --> 28:30.560
'We've been stunned
by the revelations

28:30.560 --> 28:32.970
and achievements
of the Meyer presidency

28:32.970 --> 28:34.770
over the last few days.

28:34.770 --> 28:36.470
Why aren't they
in the book?'"

28:36.470 --> 28:38.220
That's not a bad question.

28:38.220 --> 28:40.810
Next up, Melanie, age eight.

28:40.810 --> 28:44.140
"'Publisher Weekly' calls it
'Scattered and disjointed,

28:44.140 --> 28:45.970
much like
the Meyer presidency.'"

28:47.720 --> 28:51.430
- Okay, next up, we got Ruby, age 10.
- Wow.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.890
"The 'New York Post' says,
'Remainder City.'"

28:54.890 --> 28:58.430
- Whoa.
- Can we play "What's... What's in the Bag"?

28:58.430 --> 29:01.520
Let's guess what's in the bag. - We played
that last night when you weren't here.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.770
- Ah.
- We've got Elliot, age 10.

29:03.770 --> 29:06.850
"'The New Yorker' called it
'A trite, monotonous tune

29:06.850 --> 29:09.520
that's as inconsequential
as any...'"

29:14.350 --> 29:16.220
I am still a young woman. Yeah.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.460
- Looks at my hands.
- Gorgeous.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
Look at my neck.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.520
Okay.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.310
Thank you.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.770
The library staircase

29:23.770 --> 29:26.810
goes right up and smashes
through the glass ceiling.

29:26.810 --> 29:28.520
Exactly what it's like to
be a woman.

29:30.010 --> 29:31.060
Madame President.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.770
How come you never talk about
your stay in Arizona?

29:35.100 --> 29:36.430
Leon West will not let go.

29:37.010 --> 29:41.010
He follows me around and
thinks about me 24/7, nonstop.

29:41.010 --> 29:42.430
Cuckoo.
