00:19.920 --> 00:22.120
Hey, just breathe. Okay?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.040
Yes.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.160
It'll be fine.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.800
What have you got there, Per?

00:34.000 --> 00:34.920
A periscope.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.360
Per-iscope. Like me. Funny.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.960
-That's not a periscope.
-It's a kaleidoscope, you idiot.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.840
Not so funny after all.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.200
Here. you can have it.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.000
<i>Listen up. Anyone</i>
<i>who hasn't been in quarantine</i>

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
<i>is not allowed to cross the safe line.</i>

01:04.920 --> 01:06.800
<i>The incubation time is still unclear.</i>

01:07.720 --> 01:11.200
<i>If you see anyone who has been exposed</i>
<i>to infected people or to the rain,</i>

01:11.280 --> 01:14.560
<i>you must order them to keep away from you,</i>
<i>or you risk getting infected.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:18.400
If that isn't respected,
you're allowed to open fire.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.000
We can open fire?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.440
You're allowed to do what's necessary.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.840
Come with me. You're on guard duty first.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.080
Get in! Get a move on! Go on! Shut up! Go!
All the way in! Come on!

02:24.280 --> 02:25.560
Stop there! Stop!

02:26.560 --> 02:29.160
Stop! Stay there! Stay.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.600
-Are you on your own?
-Yes, we're alone.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.480
Come any closer and I'll kill you,
understand?

02:35.720 --> 02:38.960
In there! Come on!
Beatrice, Lea, search in there.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.560
-Jean, search the tunnel.
-We have done nothing.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.600
You're staying here
so you won't infect us.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.400
We aren't infected.
We've been here for six years.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.720
We saw you in town.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.800
Who are they?

02:56.360 --> 02:59.040
Simone, you said
there wasn't anyone outside.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.240
But...

03:01.760 --> 03:04.040
But there wasn't anyone.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.240
-I can hardly breathe.
-Well, we blocked the air duct.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.800
Patrick, hurry up and secure the door.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.120
What are they looking for?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.000
Simone? Simone?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.040
I'll open the air ducts again.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.440
I'll search down here.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.600
You've all got five minutes,
then we leave again.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.160
Hello?

03:35.240 --> 03:37.440
We aren't infected. Let us out!

03:40.960 --> 03:42.280
They can't hear me.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.800
Open up! Come on.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.920
What the hell is this place?

03:57.760 --> 03:58.880
Bingo.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.280
Jean, have you found anything yet?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.680
No, not yet.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.440
We'll get out, Rasmus.
I'll get us out of here.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.000
I just wanted to see the sky.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.120
Rasmus, please just listen to me...

04:29.200 --> 04:30.400
Just leave me alone.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.200
I just want to get out of here.

04:37.880 --> 04:38.760
Now!

04:50.880 --> 04:52.960
I don't want to be down here again.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.560
Hey, breathe.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.080
Rasmus, we'll get out. We'll get out.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.760
He threatened to kill you.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.960
Rasmus.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.560
-I have an idea.
-What are you doing, Simone?

05:18.520 --> 05:19.960
I'm getting us out of here.

05:21.000 --> 05:21.840
Hey!

05:22.240 --> 05:23.280
Come.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.320
Take what you need and let's go.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.880
Come.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.480
What's your name?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.720
What's your name?

05:34.280 --> 05:37.080
What are you looking for?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.880
Where is it?

05:41.120 --> 05:43.360
I have to get her to talk. Hang tight.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.040
-I have to get her to talk.
-What's going on?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.720
Simone.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.640
Simone.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.040
What's your name?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.160
Your name? What's your name?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.440
Beatrice.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.440
Beatrice?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.640
Beatrice? Beatrice.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.200
What are you trying to find?

06:10.280 --> 06:11.960
What are you trying to find?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.920
FOOD

06:18.000 --> 06:19.600
Food. They want food.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.840
Beatrice, we're leaving.
We have to move on.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.360
Get away from the door.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.080
Not a scrap of food here.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.560
Grab whatever we can use and let's go.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.720
Yes.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.760
Martin, what about them?

06:35.720 --> 06:36.680
Beatrice!

06:37.160 --> 06:39.160
What's he saying? Oh, what's he saying?

06:39.760 --> 06:40.640
What's he saying?

06:42.280 --> 06:43.240
They're dead weight.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.640
What's going on? Don't go!

06:47.720 --> 06:48.800
Wait! No!

06:48.880 --> 06:50.720
-No, don't go!
-Come. Get out.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.160
Come on, Beatrice.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.640
You know the rules.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.600
We do not let them out.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.960
When did we turn into the kind
that kills innocent people?

07:07.080 --> 07:09.400
No! You can't go! No!

07:12.280 --> 07:14.600
-No! Don't go!
-They can't just leave us.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.920
Food. They need food.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.640
Come on.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.560
"Bunkers."

08:11.240 --> 08:12.600
"Food." What do you mean?

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
BUNKER
FOOD

08:17.560 --> 08:19.160
There are more bunkers with food?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.440
Come here. Show me where.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.200
What are you doing, Simone?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.440
Hey, show me again. Come on.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.480
No!

08:36.080 --> 08:37.200
What are you doing?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.800
Martin, Lea passed out.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.920
You have to come.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.400
Martin?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.440
Come on, man.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.360
She's gonna die
if she doesn't get food now.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.640
They're coming with us.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.640
What?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.320
They know where there's food.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.360
How do we know we can trust them?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.520
What the hell is that?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.720
Hey!

09:42.160 --> 09:44.600
Go back! This area is sealed off!

09:46.720 --> 09:47.560
Go back.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.520
Go back!

09:52.040 --> 09:53.120
Do you hear me?

09:55.440 --> 09:56.360
Turn around.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.520
I'm gonna count to three.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.440
One!

10:03.120 --> 10:03.960
Two!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.080
Go away!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.720
Please go!

10:09.280 --> 10:11.800
Go away! Don't make me shoot you!

10:20.240 --> 10:23.880
Hey, listen!
You can't go through here. Go back!

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
So where's the bunker?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.040
It's this way.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.120
Move your ass.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.320
You better be telling the truth,
or else...

11:05.520 --> 11:07.000
Look at the sun, Simone.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.760
Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.080
I've missed it so much.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.840
Shut the fuck up, you two, now.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.560
I'm afraid of them, Simone.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.640
Yeah, I don't blame you.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.440
We're coming to a road.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.200
Which way?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.800
What if he shoots us?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.120
He won't.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.680
Not now...

11:46.200 --> 11:48.080
but maybe when we get to the bunker?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.920
-I'm not buying it.
-What?

11:52.480 --> 11:55.280
Their little story
about being in a bunker for six years.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.720
We don't know them, and we're
following them like headless gooses.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.000
Geese.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.640
-What?
<i>-</i> The plural of goose is geese.

12:03.920 --> 12:04.760
What?

12:05.080 --> 12:08.200
The plural of goose is geese.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.400
Jean...

12:11.400 --> 12:12.360
whatever.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.720
Why are we following them just because
they claim to know where there's food?

12:16.800 --> 12:20.200
Look at her. She hasn't got a clue
which way to go.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.160
How far is it?

12:22.680 --> 12:24.400
We'll be there before nightfall.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.760
How did you find the bunker?

12:28.560 --> 12:29.720
What do you mean?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.640
What's your connection to Apollon?

12:40.040 --> 12:42.320
Were you down there
when the rain started falling?

12:42.400 --> 12:43.720
I don't know anything.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.760
So you don't know
that the rain killed everyone?

12:48.320 --> 12:52.920
Those who didn't die right away, infected
a hell of a lot before they croaked.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.800
So how did you all survive?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.960
-Who are you, anyway?
-Look...

13:04.320 --> 13:05.160
They're hungry.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.000
So find the food
before they get desperate.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.240
We must find shelter before dark.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.680
It's your responsibility to find
the bunker before the sun sets.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.680
My only responsibility is Rasmus.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.080
Okay.

13:24.240 --> 13:29.280
Just remember that I'll shoot the both
of you if you endanger the group. Okay?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.000
This way.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.440
<i>Help us, Martin.</i>

13:37.320 --> 13:38.960
<i>Come quickly.</i>

13:39.640 --> 13:41.760
<i>Something terrible has happened.</i>

13:42.600 --> 13:43.680
<i>Help, Martin.</i>

14:01.280 --> 14:02.360
Hello?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.280
Martin!

14:04.120 --> 14:05.000
Per?

14:05.840 --> 14:06.840
Martin!

14:07.440 --> 14:08.320
Martin.

14:09.000 --> 14:09.840
Coming.

14:12.000 --> 14:12.840
Is that you?

14:15.480 --> 14:16.320
Martin.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.840
Martin, did you let her through?

14:22.640 --> 14:23.800
She was ill.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.000
I was away from the camp for a minute,
and then everyone was dead.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.760
She appeared out of nowhere.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.920
Did you touch her?

14:32.160 --> 14:33.000
No.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.640
We need to get out of here.
We need to get out of here now.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
Put down the gun. Put it down.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.120
We have to bring the child.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.040
Per... you touched the baby?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.960
-No, I'm just taking care of her.
-Just leave her.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.520
-Come over here. Per, just leave her.
-No!

14:53.120 --> 14:54.560
Come on.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.160
Get up.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.400
No.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.080
Per?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.000
I'm sorry.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.480
Are you coming?

15:45.360 --> 15:46.240
Beatrice?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.200
What are you looking at?

15:53.040 --> 15:54.000
Trees.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.040
Trees are just trees.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
Not when you haven't seen any
for six years.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.280
-Have you always been with them?
-It's best you don't get to know me.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.200
Why?

16:12.440 --> 16:14.040
You won't be so upset when I die.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.840
What a weird thing to say.

16:17.920 --> 16:18.880
Stop.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.440
-What's that?
-Fuck.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.240
They're here, too.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.440
Get down!

16:24.520 --> 16:25.360
Come.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.320
-Rasmus.
-Patrick!

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
What's going on?

16:37.120 --> 16:37.960
Who are they?

16:38.040 --> 16:41.440
They drive around collecting survivors.
If they get you, you're finished.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.440
They have the drone.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.800
-It's heat-seeking.
-What?

17:11.880 --> 17:12.960
Stop!

17:13.040 --> 17:14.800
Help!

17:15.800 --> 17:17.079
Stop! Get her!

17:17.160 --> 17:18.720
Stop or we'll shoot!

17:19.520 --> 17:20.920
Come.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.640
-Come. We need to go.
-We must help.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.680
But we have to help that woman.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.000
No, damn it.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.400
Beatrice, come on.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.920
But she cried for help.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.200
What kind of animals are you?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.320
There's only two of them.

17:41.720 --> 17:42.600
What?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.480
So we can help her.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.000
No, we can't. We're leaving. Come.

17:51.880 --> 17:52.840
I'll do it.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.160
Come on.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.680
What are you doing?

18:26.160 --> 18:27.000
Are you okay?

18:43.400 --> 18:47.120
I just want to go home
to my family and my children. No.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.680
Nice shot.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.520
Come.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.240
Check them.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.000
What have you done?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.000
You wanted to help, right?

19:07.560 --> 19:11.240
She was infected. She was dead
the moment her foot touched the water.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.960
Where do we go now? Hello?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.640
Which way, for fuck's sake?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.720
Across the stream.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.240
Why isn't he wearing any boots?
Why aren't you wearing any boots?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.640
-None fit me.
-So grab theirs.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.440
I'm not wearing theirs.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.680
Why not?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.080
Why not?

19:32.360 --> 19:34.160
-They're bloody.
-They're bloody, okay.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.680
-They're too small.
-Jean, tape some bags to his feet now.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.120
-Found anything we can use?
-Some ammo and this bag.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.160
-Grab it.
-Yes.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.760
We won't make it there before the rain.
We'll have to find temporary shelter.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.280
Why did he shoot her?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.200
I don't understand.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.120
Just come. Do as he says.

20:32.760 --> 20:33.640
Wait here.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.720
Secured.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.120
Don't look. Stay close to me.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.320
<i>Prepare to shut down for the night.</i>

21:19.720 --> 21:21.320
We found these blankets in the gym.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.520
Good. Help put the tables together.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.640
Patrick... is the water distilled?

21:30.120 --> 21:31.200
Yes, it's almost done.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.200
Martin, here, duct tape.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.200
Let's see what we got from the bag.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.280
What's inside?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.480
A drone and this box.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.560
The crap doesn't work.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.720
Can we do anything?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.080
No, just keep out of the way.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.520
But you need a change of clothes.
You can't wear that.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.160
You need proper footwear.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.800
-Jean, try to find some boots.
-I'm not his fucking butler.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.000
So bring him along.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.640
Beatrice, help me with Lea. Get up.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.000
I can't.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.040
Good.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.080
-Check if the water's distilled.
-Coming?

22:25.120 --> 22:27.200
Here's some food from the bunker.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.840
-Eat it.
-Here.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.120
Patrick, water.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.040
Yes.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.640
Drink.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.280
I hope we find that bunker real soon.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.480
Bingo.

23:05.080 --> 23:05.920
Yes.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.040
But you can't drink it.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.600
Relax. There's not enough
for everybody anyway.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.520
Come here.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.240
Check out the boots.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.480
It's a dead person.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.240
They all are.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.440
It's your lucky day. The latest thing.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.160
What's the deal with the backpack?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.320
Nothing. I've just got my stuff in it.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.960
Are you hiding food from the bunker in it?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.800
-Hey!
-Just checking.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.040
You're lugging drawings around?

24:04.960 --> 24:06.080
Let me see your artwork.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.400
You weren't down there for six years.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.840
Think I'm stupid?

24:15.120 --> 24:19.000
If you'd been cooped up in that bunker for
six years, you'd both have gone crazy.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
What's this?

24:23.640 --> 24:24.640
Space rockets?

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
Dinosaurs.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.360
You like dinosaurs?

24:36.800 --> 24:37.840
Who's this?

24:38.200 --> 24:39.920
A man I saw one night.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.320
In the bunker.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.160
So you weren't alone?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
We were alone,
but I saw him that one night.

24:50.320 --> 24:54.080
So you were alone for six years except for
that one night when a guy looked at you?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
Are you okay, Rasmus?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.960
Maybe you have gone crazy.

25:02.360 --> 25:03.320
Leave him alone.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.760
You've got guts.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.360
What do you mean?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.840
Not the smartest place to pee.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.800
It's a toilet.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.160
Exactly. A bug hotel.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.480
What's your problem?

25:47.560 --> 25:49.760
My problem?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.280
You seem angry with me and Rasmus.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
We're actually trying
to help you find food.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.680
We haven't done anything.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.760
Not yet.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.320
What are we gonna do?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.960
No way you were cooped up
in that bunker for six years.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.400
But if you were,
you're gonna fuck it up for us.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.040
Everyone like you is dead.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.720
Martin, the others are asleep now. Come.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.320
Yeah, I'm coming.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.520
Stay.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.880
-Stay.
-I'm on guard duty now.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.920
Stay... just this once.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.320
No, I have to go.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.560
I can't walk any further.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.400
It's not that far. We'll get there soon.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.040
Are you coming?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.360
Twenty-four...

28:59.840 --> 29:00.920
Twenty-five...

29:07.880 --> 29:09.000
Martin!

29:10.120 --> 29:12.560
-What's up?
-Lea can't go on much longer.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.440
Is it far now?

29:18.480 --> 29:21.080
Right past that lake and we're there.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.240
-I hope you're right for your sake, or...
-It's right down here.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.320
Why the glum mood?

29:36.040 --> 29:38.040
You're just looking at your shoes.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.920
They're too big.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.520
I have a spare pair of socks.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.480
Jean already gave me some.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.120
So they're snug now?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.480
What's bugging you?

29:56.680 --> 29:58.800
I thought it would be great to get out.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.720
Fuck!

30:01.360 --> 30:02.280
Martin.

30:04.240 --> 30:05.560
Check this out.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.280
Beatrice, get away from him.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.960
He only just got out.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.520
-Can't we see if...?
-No, we can't. Step away.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.400
-I'm sorry.
-No.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.760
-Get out of the way.
-No.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.200
Move, or I'll fucking shoot both of you.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.760
-Beatrice, you've got gloves, right?
-Yes.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.120
Take off his boot.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.720
Don't.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.440
Is his foot wet?

30:46.520 --> 30:47.920
-Wait.
-I can't hear you.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.920
I don't know yet.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.240
It's too dangerous, Martin.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.920
Shoot him before he infects us all.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.960
No, it hasn't gone through.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.240
My only responsibility is him.

31:08.320 --> 31:12.000
I told you those boots were good.
One hundred percent waterproof.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.760
I found the bunker.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.720
Watch your step.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.320
Who's gonna authorize you?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.400
And why the hell were you authorized?

32:11.480 --> 32:12.840
Does it matter?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.400
It does. I want to know what you know.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.200
Thanks.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.720
You're welcome.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.160
Food! Food!

32:36.120 --> 32:37.000
Food!

32:38.040 --> 32:40.840
-Finally. Great!
-Martin.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.240
Well...

32:44.440 --> 32:47.760
Good job. We found it.
Let's get something to eat.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.080
Listen, we're not going to stay with you.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.360
-We're not like you.
-No.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.880
You're naive.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.720
Why do you say that?

33:04.960 --> 33:07.880
Because you think
the world is like before. It isn't.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.120
You don't know me.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.280
I just saw you kill three people.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.280
Don't you dare judge me.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.160
Okay.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.120
But you won't survive.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.120
Patrick, you're on guard duty first.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.480
There's even more down here.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.640
Hey!

34:00.280 --> 34:01.400
No, not that one.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.720
Here, Martin.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.640
There's enough food
to last a lifetime here.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
Rasmus.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.840
Look.

34:43.560 --> 34:44.560
It's Dad's.

34:44.639 --> 34:45.520
What?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.360
He was here. Right here.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.719
I've found something really strange on it.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.880
Look at this.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.000
It's a message from Dad's old boss.

34:57.440 --> 35:01.800
He must have sent it to Dad while we were
in the other bunker. Here it is.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.880
Look.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.520
<i>Frederik, I'm sorry about your children.</i>

35:16.280 --> 35:17.640
<i>But we can't stop now.</i>

35:18.080 --> 35:19.240
<i>We have to go on.</i>

35:20.280 --> 35:24.480
<i>We've made it to the head office</i>
<i>in Sweden...</i>

35:27.000 --> 35:30.240
<i>but you must come no matter the cost.</i>

35:30.320 --> 35:31.760
<i>We have to solve this.</i>

35:32.600 --> 35:34.480
<i>Only you can do it.</i>

35:34.560 --> 35:37.920
<i>Unless we find a cure,</i>
<i>it's the end of the world.</i>

35:39.120 --> 35:40.520
The head office in Sweden.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.120
That's where Dad is.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.320
Why did he say he was sorry about us?

35:44.400 --> 35:45.440
I don't know.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.880
But Dad's alive, Rasmus.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.360
He's making a cure to save the world.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.160
We need to get up there.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.160
Yes.
