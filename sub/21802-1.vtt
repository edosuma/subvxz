00:13.580 --> 00:17.460
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.020
We want you to know
how proud we are of you.

00:20.740 --> 00:24.380
Hayley, look after your brother.
I'm counting on you.

00:24.460 --> 00:25.980
Don't worry.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.940
I think we'll remember to brush our teeth
before we go to bed. Right, Alex?

00:30.020 --> 00:33.580
Sweetie, it's just a short trip
around the moon.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.020
But be careful. I heard the jet lag
on the way back is awful.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.300
You two will always be here.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.500
Ryan, it's time to go.

00:49.580 --> 00:53.140
Wait! I want a picture.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.620
Okay.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.540
Bye.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.420
I love you, Mom.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.300
41-year-old Ryan Woods
is about to make history.

01:19.420 --> 01:22.700
As a child, Ryan Woods
fell in love with space exploration

01:22.780 --> 01:25.540
after discovering
a million-year-old meteor.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.260
She's now the first female astronaut

01:28.340 --> 01:31.460
to orbit the moon on the maiden voyage
of the Athena spacecraft.

01:31.540 --> 01:35.060
Okay, when you see Mom, cheer really loud.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.620
...and received her doctorate in physics
at Caltech.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.500
My mom, the overachiever.

01:40.580 --> 01:43.220
- You said it.
- Look! There she is!

01:45.180 --> 01:47.220
Go, Mom!

01:47.300 --> 01:49.340
- T-minus ten...
- Go, Ma!

01:49.420 --> 01:53.660
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

01:53.740 --> 01:57.140
four, three, two, one!

02:06.220 --> 02:08.580
Go, Mom!

02:10.220 --> 02:13.300
This is Mission Control,
Houston.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.820
What just happened?

02:14.900 --> 02:17.860
...contingency,
securing information...

02:19.140 --> 02:22.500
The search and rescue teams have been
mobilized in the Santa Barbara area...

02:24.940 --> 02:25.940
Alex?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.060
Stop it with the banging already!

03:18.020 --> 03:20.980
Unbelievable. My little brother
is wasting his life

03:21.060 --> 03:23.820
trying to get a stupid ball
into a stupid hoop,

03:23.900 --> 03:25.980
all so he can get
into some stupid leadership school.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.140
The Greenhouse?

03:27.220 --> 03:30.660
- It's a brainwash factory.
- Totally, but don't tell him that.

03:30.740 --> 03:32.300
He's doing all of this in honor of Mom.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.020
Who cares if Alex
gets into the Greenhouse?

03:37.100 --> 03:39.780
Besides, you can tear down that wall
between the two rooms

03:39.860 --> 03:41.620
and make yourself a luxury suite.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.380
That's not a bad idea, Mere.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.380
Sure. Don't forget to name the suite
after me, though.

03:48.780 --> 03:53.020
I mean, we could put the bed over there,
a little chill-out zone over here,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.940
and we could stick Owen over there.

03:58.420 --> 04:01.940
Alex, I changed my mind! Keep practicing!

04:07.620 --> 04:10.260
That was a limited edition
of the Dark Side from 1973.

04:10.340 --> 04:11.500
You can't get that anywhere else!

04:11.580 --> 04:13.940
Maybe you're the only one
who listens to this crap!

04:14.020 --> 04:16.660
Keep your cool, Alex. A leader needs
to keep his cool, doesn't he?

04:16.740 --> 04:20.060
I'm glad Mom's not around to see you
and your lazy friends doing nothing,

04:20.140 --> 04:23.380
- nothing with your lives!
- Stop bringing Mom into everything!

04:23.460 --> 04:24.420
That's enough!

04:33.060 --> 04:33.900
Good job.

04:42.220 --> 04:43.860
Has anyone seen my No. 2 pencil?

04:45.020 --> 04:46.140
Anybody?

04:46.780 --> 04:50.420
- Hayley, have you seen my No. 2 pencil?
- Why would you look there for it?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.780
Dad, we should leave now!

04:51.860 --> 04:54.180
It's not gonna happen, Alex.
He's still in bed.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.260
What do you mean?
We're supposed to leave now!

05:00.500 --> 05:01.940
Get him some Red Bull from the fridge.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.300
Dad, do you know where the car keys are?

05:06.380 --> 05:07.900
- Huh?
- Oh, come on!

05:07.980 --> 05:11.140
Alex, enough!
He can't get into a car like this.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.100
It's a two-hour drive from here.
I'm not gonna make it if I leave now.

05:16.340 --> 05:17.500
Dad, come on.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.380
It was my last year to qualify.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.700
I'll drive you there.

08:06.980 --> 08:10.340
All right, listen.
First, we need you to pass the exam.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.540
Remember, there's only one spot
on the Eagles.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.420
- Don't pressure me.
- There's no pressure, Tyler. Okay?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.460
We just want you to be on our team.
That's all.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.580
Yeah, but I told you guys,
I'm bad at tests.

08:19.660 --> 08:23.540
Don't worry about that, all right?
We got you all the answers.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.740
Good.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.380
You can copy, can't you?

08:29.140 --> 08:30.340
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.419
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.700
Hey, are you sure no Ravens noticed
you hack into their server?

08:35.780 --> 08:36.980
No one saw me.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.059
- Good.
- All good.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.220
All right, Tyler,
we are counting on you to get in

08:40.299 --> 08:42.380
- so we can beat Whitney this year.
- All right.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.780
Hey, Tyler...

08:49.340 --> 08:50.940
Whoo!

09:01.580 --> 09:02.420
Sorry!

09:03.460 --> 09:04.820
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

09:07.860 --> 09:10.140
- Why are they leaving?
- They were rejected.

09:10.740 --> 09:13.180
- On the same day?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.740
Okay. No stress.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.580
That's the chemistry lab
where Mom worked.

09:18.660 --> 09:21.060
I can't wait to see the new gymnasium.

09:22.580 --> 09:25.420
"Responsibility is the price
of greatness!"

09:25.500 --> 09:26.900
Shh! Everyone can hear you.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.940
Oh, what are they gonna do?
Arrest me for disrespecting the regime?

09:30.020 --> 09:31.940
- Yeah, very funny.
- Oh, yeah!

09:32.020 --> 09:33.460
Yeah, good joke, bro.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.820
Eagles! Eagles!

09:34.900 --> 09:37.700
This school takes competition
a little bit too seriously.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.500
- That's Daniel Hayward!
- Who?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.220
That's the captain of the Eagles.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.340
Hey! Hi, Daniel.

09:44.420 --> 09:48.180
Um, I just wanted to let you know,
I'm a big, big fan.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.780
I'm trying out for the Eagles, too.
I'm a shooting guard.

09:50.860 --> 09:53.900
I've learned everything
by watching you play. I'm Alex.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.060
Yeah, cool.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.340
Students in group D,
please go to room 102 for your exam.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.140
You okay? The kid looks a little pale.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.340
- Yeah, he's shaking like a leaf.
- Mmm.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.460
- Sign of weakness.
- Definitely.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.780
- Yeah, they'll pick right up on that, too.
- You know they will.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.380
He's more Raven material.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.660
Yo, stop psyching out my brother!

10:15.620 --> 10:19.620
There's a hundred applicants
and one spot on the Eagles. Just sayin'.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.540
It's okay. She didn't mean it.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.340
- Come on.
- You're the one who looks scared.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.460
What, you're afraid someone younger
and more talented will replace you?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.660
- Just sayin'.
- Why you gotta do that?

10:40.180 --> 10:42.780
The following exam is an SAT test

10:42.860 --> 10:45.140
identical to the one
given to college applicants

10:45.220 --> 10:46.500
who are a few years older than you.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.500
They get two and a half hours
to finish it.

10:50.260 --> 10:52.060
You will only have 45 minutes.

10:53.140 --> 10:56.500
Mark your answers
with the stylus attached to the tablet.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.740
We will have the result
as soon as you finish.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.540
Once you've finished the written exam,

11:00.620 --> 11:03.540
you will then take the mandatory
physical exam, for the Eagles,

11:03.620 --> 11:06.300
or the computer skills exam,
for the Ravens.

11:20.420 --> 11:23.020
- I'll be outside if you need me.
- I'm sure we'll be fine.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
Here you go.

11:31.820 --> 11:35.900
Now, anyone can take the SAT
under quiet conditions.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.020
Do I stink?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.660
- What? No, not at all.
- However, at Greenhouse Academy,

11:39.740 --> 11:44.380
we're looking for students who can focus
under less than ideal circumstances.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.660
I want you all to meet Leo Cruz,
captain of the Ravens clubhouse.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.420
He's agreed to play for you
while you take the test,

11:52.500 --> 11:53.980
which begins right now.

11:55.020 --> 11:56.020
Good luck.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.980
Oh, honey, you did your best.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.420
There are plenty of other schools
you can go to.

12:15.340 --> 12:19.140
Hey, don't cry.
Have you ever heard The Wall?

12:19.220 --> 12:20.940
That's what this place is.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.660
It's a place that takes freethinkers

12:22.740 --> 12:25.620
and turns them into nuts and bolts
on their own assembly line.

12:31.580 --> 12:34.900
Excuse me. What gives you the right
to talk about the Greenhouse like that?

12:34.980 --> 12:38.420
Forget her, Brooke.
She's just bitter she got rejected.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.740
Busted! And all I wanted to do
was get accepted

12:41.820 --> 12:44.340
so I could hang out
with such charming girls like you.

12:46.340 --> 12:49.020
- We are charming, aren't we?
- Totally charming!

12:49.100 --> 12:50.700
We are so charming.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.060
- How's she doing, Officer?
- She hasn't stolen anything yet.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.940
I still don't understand
what she's doing here, Dad.

13:22.020 --> 13:23.180
We're not a charity.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.500
She robbed the bank to make a point.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.180
The bank was gonna close a shelter
because it was in debt.

13:28.260 --> 13:33.260
And I have a deal pending with the judge.
If we accept her, she'll be pardoned.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.420
And I have faith in her.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.820
I didn't double-check.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.660
Psychology Today says
your first intuition is usually correct.

14:45.740 --> 14:46.900
Hi.

14:47.860 --> 14:51.660
Uh, excuse me.
Mommy, I'm going to have to call you back.

14:51.740 --> 14:55.220
Huh, he must be trying out for the Eagles.
Don't you think, Soph?

14:55.300 --> 14:57.060
Yeah, totally. I mean, look at him.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.900
- He's classic Eagle material.
- Perfect.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.460
Actually, I applied for the Ravens.
I'm not really that athletic.

15:01.540 --> 15:02.900
- No!
- Really?

15:02.980 --> 15:05.500
- I would've never believed it.
- Seriously, I'm shocked.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.020
Say hi to Mommy.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.300
Oh.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.260
Oh, the backpack!

15:20.380 --> 15:21.380
Get out of here!

15:22.420 --> 15:23.740
What's going on here?

15:26.980 --> 15:28.180
That's the guy.

15:29.380 --> 15:32.660
- That's the torturer?
- That's what's so cool about this place.

15:32.740 --> 15:36.060
It was a nightmare, sure,
but at the end of it, I managed to feel...

15:36.140 --> 15:37.180
Brainwashed?

15:38.900 --> 15:40.460
Come on, relax.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.820
Look, you survived the heavy metal.
Now you get to shine at the gym.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.180
I don't know, Hayley.
This place is harder than I thought.

15:47.260 --> 15:51.540
Hey, since when have you ever given up?
You're the most determined person I know.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.460
Just like Mom.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.620
- You have to mention her?
- Hey, sorry.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.540
Think about your poor sister

16:03.620 --> 16:06.180
who had to listen to you shoot hoops
until 2:00 in the morning.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.100
Come on! Come on!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.540
My one-legged grandmother
runs faster than you do.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.660
Stop. Drop, give me ten.

16:20.740 --> 16:23.220
Dad, we need to tell the officer
what to do with Ms. Sanders.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.740
I haven't made up my mind yet.

16:25.940 --> 16:29.260
I mean, just imagine
if she had a weapon on her.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.620
I hate to be the one to say I told you so.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.300
I thought she'd blossom here,
not fall apart.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.260
At my school, we didn't have a view
of the Pacific, you know?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.220
If you moved an inch in your seat,

16:39.300 --> 16:41.260
you were sent straight
to the principal's office.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.820
I wasted 12 years like that.

16:45.420 --> 16:48.740
Are we leaving or are we going down
a trip on memory lane?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.700
Okay, okay, that's enough. Off you go.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.340
Uh...

16:54.420 --> 16:56.980
Alex Woods! Alex, you're up.

17:15.940 --> 17:19.020
Whoo! Go, Alex!

17:19.099 --> 17:21.220
Good job, Alex!

17:21.300 --> 17:23.500
He definitely takes after his mother.

17:23.579 --> 17:25.260
Even though she was a Raven.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.540
Alex is Ryan Woods' son?

17:28.420 --> 17:29.260
Yeah.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.900
Such a tragedy.

17:35.100 --> 17:40.100
- Four hundred? Are you sure?
- Four hundred.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.100
But how?

17:42.180 --> 17:45.820
We gave him all the answers!
You get 400 just for signing your name.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.340
- I know.
- This guy...

17:50.820 --> 17:52.140
The boy can shoot.

17:54.420 --> 17:55.860
No way.

17:57.820 --> 18:01.940
Hey, excuse me, Louis? About that Tyler
I was talking to you about.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.420
- He got a 400. I just checked.
- Yeah, I know.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.660
But I still think he'd make a great Eagle.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.020
I mean, he's an amazing center,

18:08.100 --> 18:10.260
and we need someone
with his height on the team.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.180
Leadership has nothing to do with height.

18:18.420 --> 18:22.340
You're right. Um, how about I play
some one-on-one with the new kid?

18:22.420 --> 18:23.980
Now, that's the spirit.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.540
All right.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.780
Hey, new kid! You up for some one-on-one?

18:30.060 --> 18:31.580
- Sure.
- All right.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.780
Yeah, Alex! You got this!

18:58.820 --> 19:01.700
- Hey, hey, foul. Hayward, knock it off!
- What?

19:02.820 --> 19:03.860
You all right?

19:05.020 --> 19:07.460
You know, I'd keep your brother
away from Daniel if I were you.

19:09.780 --> 19:13.420
I think my brother can take care
of himself, thank you very much.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.740
Hey, just trying to help.

19:14.820 --> 19:19.020
I know your type. You start off all hot
and then you choke when it really counts.

19:19.100 --> 19:21.340
You wouldn't last a day here.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.300
Shut up.

19:24.180 --> 19:27.380
What's the matter?
Don't wanna disappoint Mommy?

19:28.100 --> 19:31.340
Yeah, I heard since that explosion,
she's been all over the place.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.220
Hey! Hey!

19:35.940 --> 19:37.220
Hey, Alex! Stop it!

19:37.300 --> 19:39.260
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Get off me!

19:39.340 --> 19:42.060
Whoa! Coach!

19:42.140 --> 19:43.660
- You see this?
- Thank you, Mr. Woods.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.580
- You can leave now.
- What?

19:45.660 --> 19:46.700
You heard me.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.700
First, a criminal destroys
school property, and now that hothead?

19:55.780 --> 19:58.700
Excuse me? Are you kidding me?
I mean, Daniel started this!

19:58.780 --> 20:01.140
- Who is she?
- You must be Hayley, right?

20:01.700 --> 20:05.340
We all loved your mother,
but we can't accept that kind of behavior.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.740
I'm sorry.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.900
This is all part of your game, isn't it?

20:10.980 --> 20:13.740
I mean, my brother worked for months
to get into this school.

20:13.820 --> 20:16.140
And you did everything in your power
to ruin his chances.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.740
I bet you even enjoyed
his little breakdown, didn't you?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.300
You're just a bunch of pathetic sadists.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.380
Thank you. You can join your brother now.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.340
All the stupid slogans...

20:29.140 --> 20:31.860
You talk about educating leaders,
and for what?

20:32.460 --> 20:33.860
To produce bullies like him?

20:40.060 --> 20:41.420
Good riddance.

20:45.020 --> 20:48.140
Alex, wait! Alex!

20:48.220 --> 20:50.340
- He said something about Mom, didn't he?
- It doesn't matter.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.860
- Yes, it does. What a loser!
- No, I'm the loser.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.620
I shouldn't have reacted that way.
All right?

20:54.700 --> 20:57.340
You told me not to lose my cool,
and now I ruined everything.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.220
Hey, hey! You didn't do anything.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.260
Besides, you're too good for this place.

21:02.340 --> 21:04.860
Alex, Hayley, hold up.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.500
May I have a word?

21:07.580 --> 21:10.020
- Yes, Mr. Osmond?
- Call me Louis.

21:10.740 --> 21:14.420
Young lady, I don't agree
with a single thing you said back there,

21:14.500 --> 21:16.780
but I appreciate your raw honesty.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.180
And, Alex,
I didn't approve of your actions,

21:20.260 --> 21:22.460
but I understood why you lost your temper.

21:22.540 --> 21:25.220
You have real integrity. These are
qualities we want in our students.

21:25.300 --> 21:28.100
Good luck with that, then.
We were just leaving.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.260
Where are you going?
The new student ceremony starts at 4:00.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.380
Wait... So... so, I got in?

21:33.460 --> 21:36.580
You both did. Alex to the Eagles,
Hayley with the Ravens.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.860
If you hate the Greenhouse so much,
why not stay and fix it?

21:39.940 --> 21:42.540
- Is this a joke?
- Not at all.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.780
I'm sure you're gonna pass
the written tests.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.460
It's more of a formality for you.
You're Ryan's daughter.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.700
- Well, I was just here for my brother.
- I know.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.620
But I think you're a girl
who could use some challenges.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.820
My intuition is usually pretty good.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.140
Well, your instincts are off today.

21:59.220 --> 22:00.460
Okay, how about a trial?

22:00.540 --> 22:02.420
You pass the written test,
you can stay for 30 days.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.100
What do you say?

22:04.180 --> 22:06.940
And if you don't like it still,
then you can just go back home.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.780
We'll contact your father
for his approval.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.820
Just think about it.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.660
Hayley, wait. Hayley, what if he's right?

22:16.740 --> 22:18.220
What colour should I paint my room?

22:18.300 --> 22:19.660
- I'm thinking either...
- No, seriously, come on!

22:19.740 --> 22:21.980
Think about it. What have you got to lose?
One month.

22:22.060 --> 22:25.500
One month? Another hour here,
and it feels like an eternity.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.180
Think about all the fun
we'd have together.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.820
You promised Mom you'd take care of me.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.820
I really think this is a bad idea.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.740
Do you need anything before we start?

23:05.820 --> 23:06.820
Actually...

23:11.740 --> 23:13.620
Can you turn up the volume?

23:23.580 --> 23:24.580
Captain.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.260
And I was having a good day.

23:27.340 --> 23:30.020
Really? 'Cause I heard it kind of sucked.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.580
You should check your sources.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.660
You know, actually, my sources told me

23:33.740 --> 23:36.180
that they saw your new center
getting a ride back to Pasadena.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.860
- I hope you didn't take it too hard.
- You think I care?

23:38.940 --> 23:41.980
Well, it was a good thing that we switched
the order of the test questions

23:42.060 --> 23:44.620
when we found out that Parker
hacked into our servers, huh?

23:46.420 --> 23:47.420
You have a good day.

23:54.180 --> 23:58.180
For over two decades, our school
has nurtured this nation's leaders.

23:58.820 --> 24:03.980
Politicians, hi-tech entrepreneurs,
athletes and astronauts.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.020
Hey, did Dad ever reply to our texts?

24:15.900 --> 24:18.780
- I was sure he would be here.
- I'm here.

24:18.860 --> 24:23.580
...pioneers, leaders, visionaries
and world changers.

24:24.220 --> 24:28.180
I believe real leaders
come in all kinds of different packages.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.740
Some are a nation's scholars, sure.

24:31.820 --> 24:35.420
But some are diamonds in the rough,
students with fresh perspectives

24:35.500 --> 24:38.260
whose intellect cannot be measured
solely by numbers.

24:40.500 --> 24:44.260
So, please, give a warm welcome
to our incoming class.

24:52.660 --> 24:56.420
- I can't believe Louis invented this.
- That's why it's called the Louie.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.100
I heard he turned down
billions of dollars from Apple for it.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.540
He wanted the Louie to only be
for the students.

25:01.620 --> 25:03.420
You look just like Mom in that shirt.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.740
This is so surreal.

25:05.820 --> 25:06.980
I know.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.300
Why am I not surprised?

25:12.340 --> 25:13.340
You know her?

25:13.420 --> 25:17.620
I had the pleasure of meeting her before.
Imagine Daniel, only as a girl.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.260
Ah, great.

25:19.340 --> 25:21.500
Yeah, you're gonna have a blast
with those Eagles.

25:22.060 --> 25:25.460
Hey, kid. You coming to the after-party
at the clubhouse tonight?

25:30.020 --> 25:32.220
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

25:34.140 --> 25:35.100
Go.
