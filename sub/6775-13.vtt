HOME BOX OFFICE

01:23.630 --> 01:26.497
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.997
EXPANSION HAS SLOWED,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.719
BUT THEN, THE
ECONOMY HAS SLOWED,

02:57.730 --> 02:59.152
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.425
NO, GROWTH IS THE ONLY THING
THAT IS NATURAL, MR. GILARDI.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.898
AND GROWTH IS THE ONLY THING
THAT IS ACCEPTABLE.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.492
NOW I KNOW
THAT MAY SOUND HARSH,

03:06.500 --> 03:08.024
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

03:08.030 --> 03:11.090
TO ACCEPT ANYTHING LESS
IS SHEER LAZINESS.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.692
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T ABIDE,

03:12.700 --> 03:14.292
IT IS LAZINESS.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.722
I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU.

03:15.730 --> 03:16.754
REALLY ?

03:16.760 --> 03:18.318
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE SMART.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.399
YOU'RE AMBITIOUS.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.999
YOU'RE ALSO
SHALLOW AND AMORAL.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.355
I LIKE THAT
IN A MAN.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.590
KROEHNER NEEDS NEW
FUNERAL HOMES, MR. GILARDI.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.454
WE GOT A SERIOUS
CASH FLOW PROBLEM.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.054
WE NEED NEW REAL ESTATE
THAT WE CAN UNLOAD AT A PROFIT

03:33.060 --> 03:34.721
'CAUSE WE ARE NOT EXACTLY
LIQUID AT THE MOMENT.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.652
I DO.
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

03:36.660 --> 03:38.924
I NEED AT LEAST THREE NEW HOMES
IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA

03:38.930 --> 03:40.158
BEFORE THE
END OF THE YEAR.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.219
THREE ?
THAT'S RIGHT, THREE.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.289
AND I'M MAKING YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR FINDING THEM.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.790
NOW, I WOULD
ONLY DO THAT

03:45.800 --> 03:47.756
IF I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE UP TO IT.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.125
ANY QUESTIONS ?

03:49.130 --> 03:50.154
NO, MA'AM.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.151
HEY, FUCK YOU,
WITH THE "MA'AM" SHIT !

03:52.160 --> 03:53.650
YOU CALL ME THAT
ONE MORE TIME,

03:53.660 --> 03:55.127
I'LL HAVE YOUR
BALLS ON A PLATE,

03:55.130 --> 03:57.121
YOUR SPLEEN ON A STICK,
AND YOUR HEART BUBBLE-WRAPPED

03:57.130 --> 03:59.189
AND FED-EXED TO
YOUR MOMMA, ALRIGHT ?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.224
ALRIGHT.

04:00.230 --> 04:01.151
ALRIGHT.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.794
FUCK...

04:06.800 --> 04:09.098
MRS. HUNTLEY,
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.125
YEAH, I'M FINE.

04:11.130 --> 04:13.826
I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
THOSE ESCARGOT AT LUNCH.

04:13.830 --> 04:16.492
LITTLE FUCKERS ALWAYS
GIVE ME HEARTBURN.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.819
( belching )

04:20.660 --> 04:22.548
HEY, LET'S QUIT
AFI'ER THIS HOLE.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.619
I NEED A DRINK.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.256
GODDAMNIT,
I HOOKED IT !

04:59.460 --> 05:00.893
( beeper)

05:14.200 --> 05:17.658
( doorbell repeatedly ringing )

05:21.000 --> 05:22.991
UH, HI.

05:24.330 --> 05:25.922
DAVID, SOMETHING
AWFUL'S HAPPENED,

05:25.930 --> 05:27.693
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO TURN.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.952
AH, LOOK, TRACY.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.359
I'M SORRY YOU'RE
HAVING TROUBLE,

05:31.360 --> 05:32.497
BUT I THOUGHT
I MADE IT CLEAR...

05:32.500 --> 05:33.922
I NEED TO
ARRANGE A FUNERAL.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.090
OH.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.658
YES, MY AUNT LILIAN.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.196
SHE WAS ONLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON

05:38.200 --> 05:39.599
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.919
WHAT,

05:40.930 --> 05:42.852
YOU THOUGHT I WAS HERE
FOR SOME OTHER REASON ?

05:42.860 --> 05:45.556
OH, DAVID, PLEASE.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.324
YOU NEED TO
GET OVER YOURSELF.

05:48.330 --> 05:49.695
ALRIGHT,
THIS WON'T BE HARD.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.327
I'M MASSIVELY
ORGANIZED.

05:51.330 --> 05:52.649
I'M A PROFESSIONAL
PARTY PLANNER.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.854
DID YOU KNOW THAT ?

05:53.860 --> 05:55.452
I DID THIS HUGE
PARTY FOR NEW LINE

05:55.460 --> 05:57.348
FOR THE GOLDEN GLOBES
LAST YEAR...

05:57.360 --> 05:59.897
THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER
CALLED IT "RESPLENDENT",

05:59.900 --> 06:01.549
AND IT WAS.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.859
AUNT LILIAN'S FUNERAL NEEDS
TO BE EQUALLY RESPLENDENT.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.991
I NEED THESE PROGRAMS
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON

06:08.000 --> 06:09.490
AT THE LATEST,
GEORGE.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.388
AW, YOU'VE BEEN SUCH
A GOOD SUPPLIER TO ME,

06:11.400 --> 06:14.153
I'D HATE TO SEE THAT
RELATIONSHIP COME
TO AN END.

06:15.130 --> 06:17.928
OH, GREAT, THANK YOU,
OKAY, BYE NOW.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.295
ALRIGHT, THAT
TAKES CARE OF THAT.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.325
NOW I HAVE TO RUN OVER
TO HARRY WINSTON'S

06:21.330 --> 06:23.548
AND SEE IF I CAN GET THEM
TO LOAN ME SOMETHING FABULOUS

06:23.560 --> 06:25.391
FOR AUNT LILIAN'S VIEWING.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.924
TRACY, I JUST NEED
YOU TO SIGN...

06:26.930 --> 06:29.194
I'M SERIOUS, DAVID, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT THE COST.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.226
SHE PRACTICALLY
RAISED ME, I OWE HER.

06:32.230 --> 06:33.492
BESIDES,

06:33.500 --> 06:35.422
SHE WAS LOADED,

06:35.430 --> 06:38.627
AND ALSO, I INTEND TO SUE
THE PANTS OFF THAT COUNTRY CLUB.

06:38.630 --> 06:39.995
I STILL NEED
A SIGNATURE...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.127
I'VE HAD IT OUT FOR THEM
EVER SINCE MY DEBUT,

06:42.130 --> 06:43.791
WHEN ONE OF
THE CHINESE BUSBOYS

06:43.800 --> 06:45.950
MADE A REALLY
INAPPROPRIATE COMMENT

06:45.960 --> 06:48.121
ABOUT THE NECKLINE
OF MY DRESS.

06:48.130 --> 06:49.995
I'LL BE FAXING YOU.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.454
JESUS CHRIST, NATE,
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG ?!

06:59.460 --> 07:00.791
I TOLD YOU,
I WAS TAKING

07:00.800 --> 07:02.495
THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR'S
LICENSING EXAM.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.219
I HAD TO FINISH
OTHERWISE I'D HAVE TO WAIT

07:05.230 --> 07:06.629
UNTIL NEXT MARCH
TO TAKE IT AGAIN.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.621
OH, GOD,
I'M SORRY.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.621
IT'S JUST,

07:10.630 --> 07:14.748
I HAVE TO GO SEE BILLY
IN THE HOSPITAL.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.058
I HAVE TO, NATE.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.290
ALRIGHT.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.792
HE NEEDS ME,
I CAN FEEL IT.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.122
WILL YOU COME
WITH ME, PLEASE ?

07:26.130 --> 07:27.893
OF COURSE.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.856
THANK YOU.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.924
( Claire )
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO THIS WEEKEND ?

07:33.930 --> 07:35.591
( Parker)
I DON'T KNOW.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.124
I'LL PROBABLY COME UP
WITH SOME CREATIVE WAY

07:37.130 --> 07:38.791
TO AVOID MY FAMILY.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.097
WHY ?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.795
I'M HAVING THIS BIG
PARTY ON SATURDAY.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.926
YEAH ?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.455
YEAH, MY DAD
AND MY STEPMOM

07:45.460 --> 07:47.553
ARE RENEWING THEIR
VOWS IN HAWAII.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.096
YOU'RE NOT GOING ?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.522
NO WAY.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.623
THEY DO THIS LIKE
EVERY SIX MONTHS.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.495
IT'S SO NOT
A BIG DEAL.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.956
AND GUESS WHO
HAS THE KEYS

07:55.960 --> 07:59.020
TO HER DAD'S TOTAL
PARTY HOUSE IN BEL AIR ?

07:59.030 --> 08:00.895
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE

08:00.900 --> 08:03.050
HOW THIS LI'I'I'LE
"MISS PERFECT" ACT PAYS OFF.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.756
YEAH, WHY DO YOU
THINK I DO IT ?

08:05.760 --> 08:08.194
SO, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
AND MR. O.D. ?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.850
SHUT UP.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.521
NO, I WAS
JUST WONDERING

08:13.530 --> 08:15.225
IF HE'S, LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

08:15.230 --> 08:17.198
OVER IT.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.158
YEAH, HE IS.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.425
HE'S INCREDIBLY STRONG,

08:23.430 --> 08:26.319
HE'S MUCH STRONGER
THAN HE THINKS.

08:26.330 --> 08:30.528
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
THING, RIGHT ?

08:30.530 --> 08:33.351
I GUESS.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.954
BRING HIM TO THE PARTY
IF YOU WANT.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.849
OKAY, I WILL.

08:42.330 --> 08:44.025
I'M SURE HE HATES ME.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.850
THE ONE PERSON HE THOUGHT
HE COULD COUNT ON,

08:45.860 --> 08:47.657
AND I FUCKING
HAD HIM COMMITTED.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.594
WELL, IT WAS
FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.718
HE ALWAYS FELT
THE ENTIRE WORLD
WAS AGAINST HIM.

08:53.730 --> 08:57.257
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
MY FUCKING MOTHER,

08:57.260 --> 08:59.820
SHE HAD CHILDREN AS, LIKE,
FASHION ACCESSORIES.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.695
YOU HAD NO CHOICE,
HE COULD'VE HARMED HIMSELF.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.894
HE DID HARM HIMSELF.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.354
I'M SO AFRAID OF WHAT
HE'S GONNA SAY TO ME.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.897
BRENDA, YOU CANNOT LET
HIM HURT YOU ANYMORE.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.391
FOR YOUR GOOD,
AND FOR HIS.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.255
WHAT IF HE THINKS
I HURT HIM ?

09:17.260 --> 09:19.728
WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT ?

09:19.730 --> 09:21.425
YOU SAVED HIM.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.788
I'LL GO BY
BRISTOL FARMS

09:30.800 --> 09:33.155
AND PICK UP SOME OF THOSE
DRIED PORCINI MUSHROOMS.

09:34.930 --> 09:37.398
YOU WANNA TAKE ME
OUT TO DINNER ?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.254
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT,

09:39.260 --> 09:40.955
IT'S JUST...

09:40.960 --> 09:42.188
HIRAM, DO YOU REALIZE

09:42.200 --> 09:44.725
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
TAKEN ME OUT BEFORE ?

09:44.730 --> 09:46.391
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE
OF NATHANIEL,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.891
WE JUST ALWAYS GOT IN
THE HABIT OF STAYING IN.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.697
I HAVE TO RUN.

09:50.700 --> 09:54.124
CAN YOU PICK ME UP AT,
IS EIGHT TOO LATE ?

09:54.130 --> 09:56.849
NO, AT THE HOUSE,
BYE, NOW.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.821
I NEED YOU TO STAY
AND WORK TONIGHT.

10:03.830 --> 10:04.956
WHAT ?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.723
IS VERY BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

10:06.730 --> 10:09.119
WE HAVE THREE
UNFILLED ORDERS,
THAT'S NOTHING.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.189
AND ROBBIE'S COMING IN
AT SIX TOMORROW MORNING.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.724
IS COMING UP
ON FATHER'S DAY,

10:12.730 --> 10:14.027
VERY BUSY TIME.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.555
NO ONE SENDS FLOWERS
FOR FATHER'S DAY,

10:16.560 --> 10:18.448
WHICH IS THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.791
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'RE GONNA GET

10:19.800 --> 10:20.949
A RUSH OF ORDERS
TONIGHT ?!

10:20.960 --> 10:23.121
YES, YOU
HAVE TO STAY.

10:23.130 --> 10:25.690
CHANGE YOUR PLANS.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.190
NO.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.622
THIS IS MY BUSINESS,
I AM BOSS HERE.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.097
I'M NOT DEBATING THAT.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.024
BUT YOUR AUTHORITY DOES NOT
EXTEND TO MY PERSONAL LIFE.

10:37.030 --> 10:40.090
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
RIDICULOUS PERSONAL LIFE,

10:40.100 --> 10:42.728
GOING TO SLEEP SOME PLACE
OUTSIDE IN A TENT,

10:42.730 --> 10:44.197
LIKE REFUGEE.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.497
YES, YOU DO !

10:45.500 --> 10:47.593
YOU DON'T LIKE ME
SEEING HIRAM BECAUSE
YOU'RE JEALOUS !

10:47.600 --> 10:48.999
WELL, IT'S NO
LONGER FLA'I'TERING,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.922
IT'S JUST IRRITATING,
I HAVE CHOSEN HIRAM !

10:50.930 --> 10:52.420
I'M SORRY IF I SAID
OR DID ANYTHING

10:52.430 --> 10:54.455
THAT MADE YOU FEEL
THAT WASN'T THE CASE,
BECAUSE IT IS !

10:54.460 --> 10:56.325
NOW I WISH YOU WOULD
STOP BEHAVING

10:56.330 --> 10:57.922
LIKE A SPOILED CHILD !

10:57.930 --> 10:59.750
I HAVE DEALT WITH ENOUGH
CHILDREN IN MY LIFE.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.648
I'M FINALLY AT THE POINT
WHERE THEY CAN GET
ALONG WITHOUT ME,

11:01.660 --> 11:03.753
AND I AM NOT ABOUT
TO GO BACK !

11:03.760 --> 11:05.591
YOU ARE FIRED !

11:05.600 --> 11:08.956
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.552
I JUST D0
DO THAT !

11:10.560 --> 11:12.255
YOU CAN GO NOW,
GET OUT OF HERE,

11:12.260 --> 11:14.455
YOU'RE FIRED,
GO ON, GET OUT !

11:21.360 --> 11:22.827
IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.253
JUST THE ONE BUMP
ON HER HEAD,

11:25.260 --> 11:27.854
AND A PRETTY
BIG BRUISE.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.521
BUT MOST OF IT'S
COVERED BY HER HAIR,

11:29.530 --> 11:30.952
WHICH LUCKY FOR US,

11:30.960 --> 11:33.155
IS REMARKABLY THICK
FOR A WOMAN HER AGE.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.628
WHAT ?

11:35.630 --> 11:37.552
TRACY WANTS TO
CHANGE THE CASKET,

11:37.560 --> 11:38.822
THE FLOWERS,
THE MUSIC,

11:38.830 --> 11:40.593
AND THE TIMES
OF THE VIEWING.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.522
AND THE CEREMONY.

11:42.530 --> 11:43.952
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PUT TOGETHER

11:43.960 --> 11:45.848
A "RESPLENDENT"
FUNERAL IN TWO DAYS

11:45.860 --> 11:48.021
WHEN SHE CAN'T MAKE UP
HER FUCKING MIND ?

11:48.030 --> 11:50.328
BY TELLING HER THAT
ONCE SHE SIGNS
A CONTRACT,

11:50.330 --> 11:52.594
SHE DOESN'T GET TO
PULL ANY OF THIS SHIT.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.899
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO,
IF I WAS A PARTNER.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.027
WHICH YOU'RE NOT,
SO, PLEASE LET ME
HANDLE THIS, ALRIGHT ?

11:58.030 --> 11:59.850
I JUST NEED YOU DO
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER

11:59.860 --> 12:02.192
TO MAKE HER LOOK THE BEST
SHE POSSIBLY CAN.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.293
I ALWAYS DO
THAT, DAVID.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.597
OF COURSE YOU DO,
FEDERICO,

12:05.600 --> 12:07.625
IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS
A VERY IMPORTANT FUNERAL,

12:07.630 --> 12:09.598
AND WE STAND TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.295
WHICH I WON'T
SEE ANY OF.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.757
WE JUST
GAVE YOU A RAISE.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.696
( tv chatter )

12:35.530 --> 12:37.555
DO WANT ME TO
COME WITH YOU ?

12:37.560 --> 12:40.495
NO, I DON'T WANT HIM
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.124
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT HERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

12:53.830 --> 12:55.695
OKAY.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.297
BILLY ?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.859
HI.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.953
HI.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.054
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

13:22.060 --> 13:24.199
UH, FINE.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.326
YEAH ?

13:25.330 --> 13:26.854
YEAH.

13:26.860 --> 13:30.489
WHATEVER I WAS FEELING BEFORE
I'M NOT FEELING NOW.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.055
I'M SO SORRY,
BILLY.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.789
IT'S SO WEIRD.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.291
I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.696
AND I COULD HAVE
SERIOUSLY HURT YOU.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.050
IT ALL MADE SENSE
AT THE TIME.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.257
I HATE THIS.

14:01.260 --> 14:05.424
I HATE THAT MY BLOOD
MAKES ME CRAZY.

14:05.430 --> 14:07.625
I HATE THAT
I CAN'T FUNCTION

14:07.630 --> 14:09.393
WITHOUT BEING
CHEMICALLY ALTERED.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.027
I HATE THAT
I FUCKED UP YOUR LIFE.

14:11.030 --> 14:12.622
YOU HAVEN'T.

14:12.630 --> 14:15.554
I DID THAT
ON MY OWN.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.494
NO, YOU DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.354
I DON'T.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.051
I MUST HAVE SOME
WEIRD-ASS KARMA.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.358
WE BOTH DO.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.419
NO, IT'S JUST ME.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.990
THE FACT THAT I COULD'VE
HURT YOU LIKE THAT...

14:36.130 --> 14:38.997
UPSETS ME LIKE
NOTHING EVER HAS.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.292
AND WHEN
I LOOK AT YOU,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.894
ALL I WANT TO SAY IS
I'M SORRY.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.891
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

14:52.730 --> 14:57.326
AND INSIDE I FEEL LIKE TEARS
ARE STREAMING DOWN MY CHEEKS.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.424
BUT THEY'RE NOT,
ARE THEY ?

15:04.630 --> 15:08.191
DON'T CRY,
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.897
JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.257
YOU BE HAPPY,
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.228
I'LL BE HAPPY
IF YOU ARE.

15:18.230 --> 15:20.619
OKAY.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.695
I'M SO LOST,

15:28.700 --> 15:30.850
INSIDE.

15:33.730 --> 15:36.597
I WISH THAT
I COULD GET OUT.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.091
BUT I DON'T THINK
I EVER WILL.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.027
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

15:51.030 --> 15:53.021
IT'S ALRIGHT.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.319
IT'S OKAY.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.051
YOU'RE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.997
HOW COME THERE'S NO
HOME MOVIES OF ME

16:10.000 --> 16:11.456
WHEN I WAS A KID ?

16:11.460 --> 16:13.655
I'M NOT SURE.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.628
AFTER I BOUGHT THAT
NEW SUPER 8 CAMERA,

16:15.630 --> 16:17.996
WE FILMED EVERYTHING
THE BOYS DID.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.093
AFTER YOU CAME ALONG,

16:20.100 --> 16:21.988
I GUESS WE SORTA
FELT LIKE, YOU KNOW,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.888
BEEN THERE,
DONE THAT.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.357
YEAH, I KNOW.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.089
WHICH MADE ME FEEL LIKE,
TOTALLY SECONDARY,

16:28.100 --> 16:29.419
THANK YOU.

16:29.430 --> 16:31.557
CHEER UP, KITTEN.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.199
MAYBE SOME OF THAT
ATTENTION YOU NEVER GOT

16:34.200 --> 16:36.760
WILL MOTIVATE YOU
TO GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS

16:36.760 --> 16:39.251
AND DO SOMETHING
INTERESTING WITH YOUR LIFE.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.150
( door slamming )

16:48.860 --> 16:51.021
I GOT FIRED TODAY.

16:51.030 --> 16:53.328
THAT SUCKS.

16:53.330 --> 16:54.592
YES, IT DOES.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.919
AND IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH,

16:55.930 --> 16:58.057
I BELIEVE I WAS A VICTIM
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

16:58.060 --> 16:58.992
WHAT ?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.558
NIKOLAI WANTED ME
TO WORK LATE

17:00.560 --> 17:02.448
TO KEEP ME FROM HAVING
DINNER WITH HIRAM,

17:02.460 --> 17:04.348
AND WHEN I REFUSED,
HE FIRED ME.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.851
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT A DORK !

17:06.860 --> 17:08.225
I KNOW,
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ?

17:08.230 --> 17:10.050
I HAVE A GOOD MIND
TO CALL A LAWYER.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.891
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
BETTER OFF OUT OF THERE.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.527
I HAVE A CERTIFICATE
IN FLORAL ARRANGING.

17:13.530 --> 17:14.895
I CAN GET A JOB
ANYWHERE.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.197
YEAH, SCREW NIKOLAI.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.394
EXACTLY.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.423
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED ?

17:26.430 --> 17:29.649
AH, SURE, I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, BUT--

17:29.660 --> 17:31.628
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
ALMOST A YEAR,

17:31.630 --> 17:34.758
AND YOU PRACTICALLY
LIVE AT MY HOUSE.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.318
YOU SEE ME
AT MY WORST,

17:36.330 --> 17:39.891
WHAT OTHER
INFORMATION
DO YOU NEED ?

17:39.900 --> 17:41.595
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
SIX MONTHS, BREN'.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.556
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE COUNTING THE DAYS.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.652
I'M NOT--

17:44.660 --> 17:46.218
WHAT, DO YOU MARK
THEM OFF AT NIGHT ?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.492
LIKE A PRISONER
IN HIS CELL

17:47.500 --> 17:49.388
LIKE THE COUNT OF
FUCKIN' MONTE CRISTO ?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.618
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU SO HOT
ON THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE ?

17:51.630 --> 17:53.325
I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.651
I NEED TO KNOW IF
I'M WASTING MY TIME.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.128
WHAT IF I WANNA
HAVE CHILDREN ?

17:58.130 --> 17:59.757
YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.455
WELL, DO YOU ?

18:01.460 --> 18:03.792
I MEAN, YOU'RE
WHAT, 35 ?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.791
WHAT'S THE LONGEST
RELATIONSHIP

18:05.800 --> 18:07.199
YOU'VE EVER
BEEN IN ?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.349
UH, THIS ONE.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.725
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S PATH ETIC.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.095
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP

18:11.100 --> 18:12.522
SINCE FUCKING
HIGH SCHOOL.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.350
AT LEAST I'VE HAD
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.998
AT LEAST
I KNOW WHAT ONE IS.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.992
WOULD'VE FUCKIN'
SKIPPED OUT ON YOU,

18:20.630 --> 18:22.427
OKAY, NOW WE'RE
GETTING TO THE POINT.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.625
NOW WE'RE GETTING TO
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON,
YOU WANNA BAIL.

18:24.630 --> 18:25.995
NO, YOU WANT
ME TO BAIL !

18:26.000 --> 18:26.557
( horn honking )

18:26.560 --> 18:27.652
LOOK OUT !

18:31.230 --> 18:33.391
( horn blaring )

18:40.460 --> 18:43.020
AUGUSTO'S CHRISTENING
IS SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.157
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT
HAVING A PARTY AFTERWARDS,

18:45.160 --> 18:50.951
YOU KNOW, FOR MY FOLKS
AND VAN ESSA'S AN D,

18:50.960 --> 18:52.791
WELL, OUR PLACE
IS A LITTLE SMALL.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.898
DO YOU THINK
WE COULD HAVE IT HERE ?

18:58.900 --> 19:00.652
UH...

19:00.660 --> 19:03.128
RIGHT NOW,
LILIAN MONTROSE'S
VIEWING IS SCHEDULED

19:03.130 --> 19:04.529
FOR THREE TO SIX.

19:04.530 --> 19:06.191
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.020
I WAS THINKING
AFTER THAT.

19:08.030 --> 19:10.897
I'M ONLY ASKING
BECAUSE I,

19:10.900 --> 19:15.826
I STILL THINK
OF YOUR FAMILY
AS MY FAMILY,

19:15.830 --> 19:18.128
AND, UM,

19:18.130 --> 19:21.793
I REALLY WANT
YOU ALL TO BE THERE.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.897
SURE.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.789
WE'D BE HAPPY TO LET
YOU HAVE THE PARTY HERE.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.360
THANKS, BOSS.
(fax machine rings )

19:29.360 --> 19:31.897
COULD YOU LOAD ME
A HYPODERMIC

19:31.900 --> 19:34.357
WITH SOME PHENOL SOLUTION
FOR THIS BUMP ?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.396
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER START
WITH A PHENOL COMPRESS ?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.550
WHY, AN INJECTION WILL
GET RID OF THE SWELLING

19:38.560 --> 19:40.221
AND TAKE CARE
OF THE BRUISING.

19:40.230 --> 19:43.449
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER
AT THIS, DAVE.

19:43.460 --> 19:45.519
THANK YOU,
FEDERICO.

19:45.530 --> 19:47.998
OH, GREAT,
NOW WHAT ?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.729
TRACY'S DECIDED TO HAVE
AUNT LILIAN CREMATED

19:49.730 --> 19:52.551
AND HER ASHES PLACED
IN A FABERGE EGG ?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.596
CAN WE DO IT
BY SEVEN TONIGHT ?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.558
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LOOK AT THIS.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.221
WELL, WHAT IS IT ?

20:01.760 --> 20:03.990
OH, GOOD GRIEF.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.319
( male )
ADULT FEMALE,
UNRESTRAINED DRIVER,

20:10.330 --> 20:11.729
UNCONSCIOUS UPON
ARRIVAL

20:11.730 --> 20:13.698
NOW RESPONSIVE ONLY
TO PAINFUL STIMULI.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.521
BLOOD PRESSURE 86/40,
PULSE 130,

20:16.530 --> 20:18.259
RESPIRATIONS 36
AND SHALLOW.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.420
BRENDA ?

20:19.430 --> 20:21.557
BRENDA, WHY WON'T
YOU TALK TO ME ?

20:21.560 --> 20:23.721
TRACHEA IS MIDLINE,
NECK VEINS ARE FLAT...

20:23.730 --> 20:26.790
WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

20:26.800 --> 20:29.325
PATIENT TWO,
ADULT MALE...

20:29.330 --> 20:31.218
SIR, YOU'VE BEEN
IN AN ACCIDENT.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.596
JUST STAY CALM, OKAY ?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.091
ADULT MALE,
HE'S ALERT NOW,
BUT CONFUSED,

20:36.100 --> 20:37.419
NO MEMORY
OF ACCIDENT.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.352
WHY IS HER HEAD
IN THAT THING ?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.328
SHE HAD AN INJURY,
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:41.330 --> 20:42.456
IS SHE DEAD ?

20:42.460 --> 20:44.325
SHE'S FINE,
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.355
( sirens blaring )

20:51.800 --> 20:53.529
HOW'S YOUR
SEA BASS ?

20:53.530 --> 20:55.350
DELICIOUS,
THAN K YOU.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.697
RUTH, I NEED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

20:59.700 --> 21:03.022
AND I'M NOT
PROUD OF THIS.

21:03.030 --> 21:04.827
WHAT IS IT ?

21:04.830 --> 21:07.924
I'VE MET SOMEONE.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.649
OH.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.493
I NEVER MEANT FOR
THIS TO HAPPEN.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.252
I WASN'T LOOKING.

21:15.260 --> 21:18.696
YES, WELL, THAT'S ALWAYS
WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN.

21:19.900 --> 21:23.028
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
QUITE HOW TO--

21:23.030 --> 21:24.292
OH, BOY.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.825
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO SAY THIS.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.594
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
SPIT IT OUT.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.023
I'D LIKE TO PURSUE IT.

21:32.030 --> 21:35.921
THINGS BETWEEN YOU AND I
HAVE FELT, WELL,

21:35.930 --> 21:37.693
NOT EXACTLY,

21:37.700 --> 21:40.658
AND I FEEL A BOND
WITH THIS NEW PERSON

21:40.660 --> 21:42.628
THAT, WELL THE
BEGINNINGS OF A BOND,

21:42.630 --> 21:45.019
THAT COULD BE SOMETHING
QUITE PROFOUND.

21:47.830 --> 21:49.058
ALRIGHT.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.027
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE MORE UPSET.

21:56.030 --> 21:58.555
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE SAME THING.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.552
HIRAM, PLEASE,
GO, EXPLORE.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.949
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF
AND WHOEVER SHE IS.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.451
MAYBE THE TWO OF YOU
COULD HAVE SOMETHING,

22:06.460 --> 22:08.553
AS YOU SAY,
PROFOUND.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.619
LORD KNOWS, WE DON'T.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.951
WELL, IF IT WAS,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.224
THIS WOULD BE A LOT MORE
DIFFICULT, WOULDN'T IT ?

22:15.230 --> 22:16.720
IT IS DIFFICU LT,

22:16.730 --> 22:18.129
FOR ME.

22:20.700 --> 22:24.227
LET'S ORDER DESSERT,
THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.192
HEY, YOU.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.498
THE DOCTOR SAYS
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.228
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

22:48.230 --> 22:49.822
I'M OKAY.

22:49.830 --> 22:52.298
A LITTLE BANGED UP BUT
APPARENTLY NOTHING BROKEN.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.258
I'M SORRY
I ALMOST KILLED YOU.

22:55.260 --> 22:57.899
GODDAMNIT.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.619
THIS IS GONNA SEND
MY CAR INSURANCE PREMIUMS

23:00.630 --> 23:02.097
THROUGH THE ROOF.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.318
WHEN YOU WERE
UNCONSCIOUS I PRAYED.

23:13.330 --> 23:15.958
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN SINCE I PRAYED ?

23:15.960 --> 23:18.053
AND I HAVE NEVER
PRAYED LIKE THIS.

23:18.060 --> 23:22.019
SO, BECAUSE OF ME,
YOU'VE BECOME BORN AGAIN ?

23:22.030 --> 23:24.555
I'M SO SORRY.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.755
YOU ARE ONE
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

23:26.760 --> 23:29.649
AND SOMETIMES
INFURIATING WOMAN,

23:29.660 --> 23:32.697
AND I CANNOT IMAGINE
MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.660
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
BE A BETTER DRIVER,

23:36.660 --> 23:39.959
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.349
PROMISE ME YOU'LL LIVE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.452
AW...

23:43.460 --> 23:45.758
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO IF I LOST YOU.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.923
SO, IF YOU WANNA GET MARRIED,
I'M ALL FOR IT.

23:48.930 --> 23:51.922
OKAY, MAYBE
I WAS OVERREACTING.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.459
LET'S JUST TAKE ONE STEP
AT A TIME, SHALL WE ?

24:17.830 --> 24:19.855
FATHER JACK
DOESN'T DENY

24:19.860 --> 24:22.693
HE PERFORMED A COMMITMENT
CEREMONY FOR TWO LESBIANS.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.122
PRIVATELY,
NOT IN CHURCH.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.894
THE CONFERENCE
RESOLUTION ON SEXUALITY

24:26.900 --> 24:29.095
EXPRESSLY CONDEMNS
THE BLESSING

24:29.100 --> 24:30.727
OF SAME-SEX UNIONS.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.153
AN D, COUNCILS
AGAINST ORDINATION...

24:33.160 --> 24:36.698
( female )
WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE
WITH THIS RESOLUTION...

24:36.700 --> 24:38.520
( bickering )

24:38.530 --> 24:41.328
( female )
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
JACK HIMSELF IS GAY.

24:41.330 --> 24:45.619
( male )
I THINK WE SHOULD
ASK JACK TO LEAVE.

24:45.630 --> 24:47.621
AND SO DO
JAMES AND OWEN,

24:47.630 --> 24:49.621
AND I'M GUESSING
DAVID FEELS THE SAME.

24:55.030 --> 24:56.793
ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.689
THE CHURCH REJECTS
HOMOSEXUAL PRACTICE

24:59.700 --> 25:02.351
AS INCOMPATIBLE
WITH SCRIPTURE.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.328
SO, BECAUSE OF
THEIR RANDOM GENETICS,

25:04.330 --> 25:07.197
GAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE DENIED
ANY ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL LOVE ?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.827
THAT IS LIBERAL
CLAPTRAP.

25:08.830 --> 25:11.754
IT'S NOT GENETICS,
IT CAN BE OVERCOME.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.251
WALTER, THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT FOR SURE

25:14.260 --> 25:16.194
IS IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU OVERCAME.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.158
AND THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULDN'T KNOW IT

25:19.160 --> 25:24.188
IS IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE
NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME.

25:26.130 --> 25:28.325
ARE YOU GAY, DAVID ?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.118
YES.

25:32.130 --> 25:36.692
THEN HIS VOTE
CANNOT BE COUNTED HERE.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.019
( female )
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,

25:38.030 --> 25:39.622
HE'S A DEACON,
HE GETS A VOTE.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.928
DAVID DOES NOT OBEY
THE LAWS OF THE CHURCH.

25:41.930 --> 25:43.898
( female )
WITHOUT HIS VOTE,
IT'S AN EVEN SPLIT.

25:43.900 --> 25:45.652
HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO RESOLVE THE MATTER ?

25:45.660 --> 25:48.390
I THINK WE SHOULD GET
THE BISHOP INVOLVED.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.494
OKAY, WE TALKED
ABOUT THE FLOWERS,

25:51.500 --> 25:54.151
I GAVE YOU THE CD I BURNED
WITH MUSIC FOR THE VIEWING.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.957
I WISH DAVID WERE HERE,

25:55.960 --> 25:58.121
I'D MUCH PREFER TO GO
OVER THINGS WITH HIM

25:58.130 --> 25:59.859
RATHER THAN WITH
SOME UNDERLING, BUT...

26:05.460 --> 26:09.351
OH, NO, NO,
NO, THIS WON'T DO.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.021
WHAT ?

26:11.030 --> 26:14.295
WELL, THIS RIGHT HERE,
THERE'S A NICK IN THE WOOD.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.495
OH, NO, THAT'S
PART OF THE GRAIN.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.650
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.719
ALRIGHT, WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO RETURN IT

26:20.730 --> 26:22.652
AND THEN GET
A NEW ONE.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.799
THAT'S NOT
POSSIBLE.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.698
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS CASKET,

26:29.700 --> 26:31.429
AND EVEN IF THERE WAS,

26:31.430 --> 26:33.398
IT'S TOO LATE TO GET ANOTHER ONE
LIKE IT BY TOMORROW.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.288
I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.756
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT THE COST.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.853
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER ONE
OF THIS MODEL AVAILABLE.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.521
WE HAD TO HAVE
THIS ONE SHIPPED DOWN

26:40.530 --> 26:42.395
FROM SAN FRANCISCO
AS IT WAS.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.322
I'M VERY UNHAPPY
ABOUT THIS.

26:44.330 --> 26:45.854
OH.

26:47.130 --> 26:49.394
WELL, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO CALL THINGS OFF,

26:49.400 --> 26:51.288
I CAN BRING
YOUR AUNT'S BODY UP

26:51.300 --> 26:54.098
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE, OKAY ?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.820
( phone )

26:58.830 --> 27:00.229
HELLO ?

27:00.230 --> 27:03.393
HIRAM, THERE'S
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

27:03.400 --> 27:07.154
NO, I'M NOT ANGRY.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.094
MOM, I'LL PROBABLY
BE SENDING TONIGHT

27:09.100 --> 27:10.249
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

27:10.260 --> 27:11.329
WHAT FRIEND ?

27:11.330 --> 27:12.991
PARKER MCKENNA.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.490
I DON'T KNOW
ANY PARKER.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.024
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
MET HER YET.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.327
OH, GOOD GRIEF.

27:17.330 --> 27:20.128
HIRAM, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTED TO BREAK UP.

27:20.130 --> 27:22.223
WELL, I'M SORRY IF YOU'RE
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS,

27:22.230 --> 27:24.357
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.897
MEN CAN BE
SO STUPID.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.357
UM, YEAH.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.659
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO HAVE
PARKER'S MOTHER CALL ME, OKAY ?

27:33.760 --> 27:35.819
OKAY.

27:55.330 --> 27:57.594
OH, NATE,
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.852
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU LATER.

27:59.860 --> 28:01.555
IN PRIVATE.
ABOUT WHAT ?

28:01.560 --> 28:02.754
GOOD MORNING.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.398
HOW ARE YOU
THIS MORNING ?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.652
OH, GOD.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.120
I WAS HAVING THE MOST
INCREDIBLE DREAM.

28:12.130 --> 28:14.894
I WAS SWIMMING
WITH DOLPHINS

28:14.900 --> 28:18.097
ONLY WE WEREN'T SWIMMING,
WE WERE FLYING.

28:18.100 --> 28:21.251
AND DREW BARRYMORE
WAS THERE.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.991
WHATEVER YOU'RE ON,
I WOULD LIKE SOME OF IT.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.888
SHE WAS LIKE
MY BEST FRIEND.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.629
HOW'S YOUR
HEADACHE TODAY ?

28:28.630 --> 28:30.188
IT'S BETTER.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.089
OH, MY GOD, AND THERE WAS
THIS SHARK FOLLOWING US.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.954
AND I THINK IT WAS
COURTNEY LOVE.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.894
HOW'D SHE LOOK ?

28:36.900 --> 28:38.993
SHE WAS IN VERSACE.

28:40.430 --> 28:42.955
( David )
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE,

28:42.960 --> 28:44.552
THAT THE SAME GOD
WHO MADE US

28:44.560 --> 28:46.892
WANTS US TO BE LONELY AND
FRUSTRATED ALL OUR LIVES,

28:46.900 --> 28:48.959
WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD
IS FREE TO MAKE LOVE,

28:48.960 --> 28:50.291
AND HAVE FAMILIES ?

28:50.300 --> 28:51.722
NO, GOD ISN'T
THAT CRUEL.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.789
GOOD FOR YOU
FOR MARRYING
TWO LESBIANS.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.449
MY HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLFRIEND.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.691
WHO DO YOU THINK
SENT THAT FAX ?

28:58.700 --> 29:00.327
WALTER SWEARS
IT WASN'T HIM.

29:00.330 --> 29:03.197
I AM SO FUCKING TIRED
OF BEING ASHAMED.

29:13.030 --> 29:15.123
WE'LL JUST
FIGHT BACK,

29:15.130 --> 29:16.654
YOU AND ME,
WE'LL FIGHT THEM.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.890
WALTER'S JUST A BULLY,
WE'LL JUST BULLY HIM BACK.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.652
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.128
I'VE AGREED TO NOT OFFICIATE
AT ANY OTHER GAY WEDDINGS.

29:27.130 --> 29:30.099
AND YOU GET TO STAY.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.828
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT ?

29:33.830 --> 29:35.388
RELIEVED.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.494
I'VE PUT IN
ALMOST SIX YEARS
HERE AT ST. BART'S

29:38.500 --> 29:41.389
AND I'D REALLY PREFER
NOT TO HAVE TO START OVER
SOMEWHERE NEW,

29:41.400 --> 29:43.527
NOT AT THIS POINT
IN MY LIFE.

29:45.230 --> 29:48.449
AND I HAVE A FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU.

29:48.460 --> 29:52.157
I NEED YOU TO
RESIGN AS DEACON.

29:53.430 --> 29:56.558
OTHERWISE, WALTER
WILL KEEP MAKING NOISE

29:56.560 --> 29:58.323
UNTIL HE GETS HIS WAY,

29:58.330 --> 30:00.890
AND I'D REALLY PREFER NOT
TO GET THE BISHOP INVOLVED.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.697
JACK, YOU CAN'T
GIVE IN TO THEM.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.588
I KNOW WHICH BATTLES
CAN BE WON, DAVID.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.420
THIS IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.920
WOW.

30:07.930 --> 30:10.899
I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE,

30:10.900 --> 30:13.721
I DON'T KNOW,
BRAVER THAN THAT.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.325
I'M TIRED.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.753
I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS BETTER AROUND HERE

30:20.760 --> 30:22.921
AND NEVER SUCCEEDING
BECAUSE OF POLITICS.

30:22.930 --> 30:26.229
I JUST DON'T HAVE IT
IN ME RIGHT NOW.

30:26.230 --> 30:28.698
BUT, HOW CAN YOU...

30:28.700 --> 30:30.725
YOU'RE GAY.

30:30.730 --> 30:33.824
NO, I'M NOT.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.094
I'M NOT.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.227
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS
ASSUMED THAT,

30:38.230 --> 30:40.698
BUT, I'M NOT.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.328
SORRY.

30:43.330 --> 30:45.491
MORE SCOTCH ?

30:52.830 --> 30:55.196
NO, THANKS.

31:01.122 --> 31:01.130
I REALLY DON'T
WANNA BE HERE.

31:01.130 --> 31:02.654
OH, GET OVER
YOURSELF.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.151
I KNOW YOU AND PARKER
HAD SEX, SO WHAT ?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.720
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY
I SLEPT WITH.

31:07.730 --> 31:10.198
RIGHT, BUT
AM I THE LAST ?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.122
MAYBE.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.155
( music playing )

31:19.500 --> 31:20.922
WOW...

31:20.930 --> 31:24.195
WHAT THE FUCK DO
THESE PEOPLE DO ?

31:24.200 --> 31:28.318
HER FATHER'S LIKE SOME
MOVIE BIGWIG, I THINK.

31:31.330 --> 31:34.390
( male )
UH-UH, INVITATION ONLY.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.425
OKAY, THIS
IS TRAGIC.

31:36.430 --> 31:37.829
WE CAN ALWAYS LEAVE.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.855
LET'S JUST
FIND THE BAR.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.122
EXCUSE ME ?

31:41.130 --> 31:43.496
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE BAR IS ?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.491
( female )
OVER THERE.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.891
WHERE'S
PARKER ?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.299
IT'S NOT HER HOUSE.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.097
THIS IS A PORN PARTY,
I'M TELLING YOU,

31:53.100 --> 31:54.829
THEY'RE SHOOTING
A PORNO HERE.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.592
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THAT ?

32:00.600 --> 32:02.295
FAGGOT.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.791
HEY, SHUT UP,
MY BROTHER'S
A FAGGOT.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.951
OH, YEAH,
I'M SORRY.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.719
LET'S JUST SAY HI
AND LEAVE, OKAY ?

32:12.730 --> 32:17.793
OH, NO, THIS COULD
BE KINDA FUN, C'MON.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.692
HEY, PARKER.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.225
THIS IS A REALLY NICE
HOUSE YOU'VE GOT HERE.

32:23.230 --> 32:25.221
I KNOW, SO, LIKE,
OF COURSE

32:25.230 --> 32:26.925
I DON'T GET
TO LIVE HERE,

32:26.930 --> 32:28.750
I JUST GET TO TRASH IT
WHEN THEY'RE GONE.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.456
THIS IS WARREN,
THIS IS CLAIRE.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.791
(Warren )
NICE TO MEET YOU.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.324
AND, UH...

32:34.330 --> 32:35.752
GABRIEL.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.599
( doctor )
THIS IS WHAT CONCERNS ME,

32:41.600 --> 32:44.489
THIS AREA OF DECREASE...
IT'S VERY FAINT.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.526
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THERE'S AN ACUTE INJURY

32:47.530 --> 32:49.555
BUT SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.791
WELL, SHE'S GONNA BE
ALRIGHT, ISN'T SHE ?

32:54.100 --> 32:55.954
THESE ARE YOUR CAT SCAN
RESULTS, NATE.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.427
MINE ?

32:57.430 --> 33:00.399
DON'T WORRY ABOUT BRENDA,
HERS WAS TOTALLY CLEAN.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.897
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT IS ?

33:05.900 --> 33:09.097
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
A SHOT OF CONTRAST DYE

33:09.100 --> 33:11.728
AND DO ANOTHER CAT SCAN
TO REALLY KNOW.

33:16.300 --> 33:18.689
OH, HELLO,
MRS. FISHER ?

33:18.700 --> 33:21.351
THIS IS ELISE MCKENNA,
PARKER'S STEPMOTHER.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.998
CLAIRE ASKED ME
TO CALL YOU.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.854
YES, I JUST
WANTED TO BE SURE

33:24.860 --> 33:26.259
THERE'S PROPER
ADULT SUPERVISION

33:26.260 --> 33:27.591
IF SHE'S
STAYING THERE.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.352
OH, ABSOLUTELY,
YES, OF COURSE.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.055
DON'T WORRY
FOR A MINUTE.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.220
Alright, then.

33:32.230 --> 33:33.822
I DON'T WANT
HER DRINKING.

33:33.830 --> 33:35.889
Oh, there isn't even
any liquor in the house.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.050
YOU SEE, MY HUSBAND
AND I ARE BOTH ALCOHOLICS.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.358
AND PARKER'S FRESH
OUT OF REHAB, SO,

33:40.360 --> 33:42.294
WE'LL TAKE REALLY
GOOD CARE OF CLAIRE,

33:42.300 --> 33:43.426
I promise.

33:43.430 --> 33:44.590
Kisses.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.496
THAT WAS MEAN.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.149
WHAT ?

33:53.260 --> 33:56.058
( Gabe )
THIS IS LIKE A HOLLYWOOD
ASS-WAXING PARTY.

33:56.060 --> 33:58.096
EVERYBODY'S WEARING
LEATHER OR RUBBER.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.091
SERIOUSLY, BRO,
SERIOUSLY.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.852
RIP THOSE FUCKING
NIPPLE RINGS OUT.

34:01.860 --> 34:03.191
NO SHIT.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.225
DUDE, WHERE WERE
YOU LAST NIGHT ?

34:05.230 --> 34:09.052
I CALLED AND YOUR MOM
WAS ALL "I DON'T KNOW."

34:09.060 --> 34:10.994
I WAS HANGING
WITH MY GIRL.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.889
OKAY, WELL, WHILE YOU WERE
GETTING YOUR TOES SUCKED,

34:13.900 --> 34:18.098
WE SUCKED DOWN
A FREE SIXER FROM 7-11.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.999
FUCK, WE PULLED
A BEER COW.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.389
A BEER COW, DUDE,
THAT'S THE SHIT.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.356
RIGHT, HELL YEAH,
A FUCKIN' BEER COW.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.419
DINK, SHUT
THE FUCK UP, DUDE.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.091
WHAT THE FUCK
IS A BEER COW ?

34:30.100 --> 34:31.624
OH, SHIT,
IT WAS MAD.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.951
WE GO TO BUY SOME BEER
AND WE GET TO THE COUNTER

34:33.960 --> 34:36.121
BUT IT'S LIKE
NOBODY HAS ENOUGH CASH.

34:36.130 --> 34:38.598
SO, DINK JUST STARTS
FUCKIN' MOOING

34:38.600 --> 34:41.228
AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS
AT THIS GUY, RIGHT ?

34:41.230 --> 34:44.097
SO, I'M LIKE, FUCK IT,
SO, I START MOOING TOO.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.398
OH, YEAH, BUT, LIKE,
REALLY FUCKIN' LOUD.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.197
LIKE WE JUST MIGHT
GO TOTALLY NUTS.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.293
DUDE, THE GUY WAS
SO FUCKIN' SCARED OF US,

34:50.300 --> 34:52.757
IT'S LIKE HILARIOUS,
IT WAS A TOTAL MOVIE MOMENT.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.456
FUCK, YEAH, AND
THEN WE GRAB ALL
THE BEER AND WE FLY.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.928
WE LAUGHED FOR LIKE
FIVE STRAIGHT HOURS.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.727
IT WAS THE SHIT.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.721
YEAH,
A BEER COW,
RIGHT ?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.596
WE GOTTA DO
THAT SHIT AGAIN.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.057
I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH FUN
SINCE I WAS LIKE, SIX.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.994
FUCKING
BEER COW, RIGHT ?

35:16.830 --> 35:18.457
WELL,

35:18.460 --> 35:21.850
WE DID FIND SOMETHING
THAT CONCERNS ME.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.323
MY GUESS WOULD BE
THAT IT'S AVM.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.389
ARTERIOVENOUS
MALFORMATION.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.049
WELL, WHAT THE
FUCK IS THAT ?

35:35.060 --> 35:37.824
ABNORMALITY ENLARGED
AND INTERTWINED BLOOD VESSELS

35:37.830 --> 35:38.854
IN YOUR BRAIN.

35:38.860 --> 35:40.327
HAVE YOU BEEN EXPERIENCING
ANY HEADACHES ?

35:40.330 --> 35:43.094
YEAH, I GET HEADACHES,
I TAKE ADVIL, THEY GO AWAY.

35:43.100 --> 35:46.490
ANY VERTIGO,
NAUSEA, PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR BALANCE ?

35:46.500 --> 35:47.694
NOPE.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.521
ANY FLUCTUATION IN
YOUR FIELD OF VISION ?

35:50.530 --> 35:51.997
LIKE WHAT ?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.252
LIKE A FLUTTERING IN
YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION ?

35:55.360 --> 35:57.157
ONCE.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.889
DO THE HEADACHES
SEEM TO AFFECT

35:58.900 --> 36:00.925
ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD
MORE THAN THE OTHER ?

36:00.930 --> 36:02.352
THE LEFT SIDE.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.793
SOMETIMES.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.894
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO
SCHEDULE AN MRI FOR YOU

36:06.900 --> 36:08.390
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.595
WHAT'S THE WORST
CASE SCENARIO HERE ?

36:10.600 --> 36:13.558
NATE, IT'S WAY
TOO EARLY FOR THAT.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.357
YOU FUCKING TELL ME.

36:18.460 --> 36:21.452
NOT ALL VASCULAR
MALFUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN

36:21.460 --> 36:22.893
BECOME SYM PTOMATIC.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.253
SOME, HOWEVER,

36:24.260 --> 36:25.818
CARRY A SIGNIFICANT
RISK OF HEMORRHAGE.

36:25.830 --> 36:27.650
SO, I COULD
HAVE A STROKE ?

36:27.660 --> 36:29.651
YOU COULD BE AT A MUCH
HIGHER RISK FOR STROKE

36:29.660 --> 36:31.423
OR SEIZURE
THAN MOST PEOPLE.

36:31.430 --> 36:33.898
WE NEED TO DO MORE TESTS
TO BE CERTAIN.

36:36.730 --> 36:38.857
COULD I DIE
FROM THIS ?

36:38.860 --> 36:41.658
IT'S POSSIBLE, YES.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.198
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.599
I DON'T SMOKE.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.125
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY
RED MEAT SINCE 1989,

36:50.130 --> 36:51.791
I RUN THREE
MILES A DAY.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.597
DON'T BLOW THIS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.819
THERE ARE TREATMENTS,
SURGICAL OPTIONS.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.991
EVEN IF IT IS AVM,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.651
YOU COULD LIVE
FOR ANOTHER 50 YEARS.

37:01.660 --> 37:03.594
HOWEVER,
I WOULD LIKE TO RUN

37:03.600 --> 37:05.921
A FULL CARDIOVASCULAR
PROFILE ON YOU

37:05.930 --> 37:09.127
BEFORE YOU CONTINUE
WITH THE RUNNING, OKAY ?

37:09.130 --> 37:11.155
( Ruth )
THIS HAPPENED
YESTERDAY ?!

37:11.160 --> 37:13.196
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL ME EARLIER ?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.725
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I WAS OKAY.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.994
WELL, YOU ARE OKAY,
AREN'T YOU ?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.024
YEAH.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.452
YEAH, I'M FINE.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.155
I'M A NERVOUS WRECK.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.526
ARE YOU
ALRIGHT, DEAR ?

37:24.530 --> 37:27.328
YES, THANK YOU.

37:27.330 --> 37:29.127
WELL, I WANT YOU
BOTH TO PROMISE ME

37:29.130 --> 37:30.791
THAT YOU'LL BE MORE
CAREFUL FROM NOW ON.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.791
( Brenda )
WE PROMISE.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.155
( Nate Sr. )
WHOA, BOY.

37:36.930 --> 37:39.421
THIS TIME
IT'S PERSONAL.

37:41.060 --> 37:43.255
WHAT'S WRONG ?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.859
NOTHING.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.952
SO, HOW OLD DID
YOU SAY YOU WERE ?

37:54.960 --> 37:57.451
HOW OLD DO YOU
WANT ME TO BE ?

37:57.460 --> 38:00.725
( Claire )
PARKER...
OH, OF COURSE.

38:00.730 --> 38:01.890
SORRY.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.299
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

38:03.300 --> 38:05.393
NOTHING, I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR GABE, I'M SORRY.

38:09.530 --> 38:12.158
( chattering )

38:16.300 --> 38:18.894
NO, NO, NO, NO.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.856
MOO.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.350
MOO.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.396
MOO.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.493
( all mooing )

38:29.260 --> 38:32.798
HEY, SAY, "MOO".

38:32.800 --> 38:34.552
WHERE THE FUCK
DID YOU GET THAT ?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.221
SAY, "MOO".

38:36.230 --> 38:37.424
MOO.

38:37.430 --> 38:40.194
NOW GIVE ME THE FUCKING
MONEY OUT OF THE REGISTER.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.954
Go get the
fuckin' car !

38:50.030 --> 38:51.122
MOO.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.591
SO, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD RESIGN ?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.591
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ?

38:59.600 --> 39:01.420
I DON'T WANT TO
BELONG TO A CHURCH

39:01.430 --> 39:02.954
THAT'S SO FUCKING
INTOLERANT.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.427
I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO WASTE MY TIME

39:04.430 --> 39:06.295
FIGHTING A FIGHT
THAT CANNOT BE WON.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.188
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
JUST SIT BACK AND TAKE IT.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.397
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT
MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE AND
I'M FUCKING SICK TO DEATH OF IT.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.288
OH, AND TO
TOP IT ALL OFF,

39:13.300 --> 39:15.518
I'M SCHEDULED TO DO
A DEVOTIONAL READING

39:15.530 --> 39:17.088
DURING MASS TOMORROW.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.249
WOW.

39:18.260 --> 39:19.727
YOU GONNA DO IT ?

39:19.730 --> 39:21.357
OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA INTIMIDATE ME

39:21.360 --> 39:23.191
INTO JUST
DISAPPEARING.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.725
OH, I CAME OUT
TO MY MOTHER.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.288
YOU'RE KIDDING.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.188
IT WAS REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.690
HOW'S SHE TAKING IT ?

39:32.700 --> 39:35.328
IT'S HARD TO TELL,
SHE'S JUST AS WEIRD AS ALWAYS.

39:39.660 --> 39:41.753
THANKS FOR MEETING ME
HERE TODAY,

39:41.760 --> 39:43.899
I JUST HAD TO TALK
ABOUT IT TO SOMEBODY,

39:43.900 --> 39:46.528
YOU KNOW, AND I COULD
ALWAYS TALK TO YOU.

39:46.530 --> 39:49.795
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT WE'VE
MANAGED TO REMAIN FRIENDS.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.656
LISTEN, I GOTTA RUN.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.252
I'M MEETING
EDDIE LATER.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.491
HEY, HE SAID HE SAW YOU
AT THE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL

39:59.500 --> 40:01.024
FOR MARC FOSTER.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.622
YEAH, YEAH,

40:02.630 --> 40:05.394
DRIVING BY
ON MY WAY HOME.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.550

40:12.560 --> 40:15.723
YEAH, WELL, LET ME KNOW

40:15.730 --> 40:16.958
I WILL.

40:16.960 --> 40:20.054
TAKE CARE, DAVID.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.391
YOU, TOO.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.456
TELL EDDIE
I SAID HI.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.951
( party chatter )

40:48.930 --> 40:50.659
( Nate Sr. )
DON'T YOU WANNA DO

40:50.660 --> 40:53.128
WHAT THOSE REALLY COOL KIDS
IN THERE ARE DOING ?

40:53.130 --> 40:54.051
NO.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.499
WHERE'S YOUR
BOYFRIEND ?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.718
I DON'T KNOW.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.149
I LIKE HIM.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.025
YEAH, SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.793
CAN'T QUITE PUT
MY FINGER ON IT.

41:11.060 --> 41:12.925
(yelling )

41:25.730 --> 41:26.697
HEY.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.758
HEY.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.091
WHERE'D YOU GO ?

41:29.100 --> 41:31.853
WE JUST WENT TO
GET SOME MORE BEER.

41:33.430 --> 41:35.796
WHY, DID YOU
MISS ME ?

41:35.800 --> 41:38.394
UH, NOT THAT
MUCH, EGO MAN.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.849
( doorbell repeatedly ringing )

41:56.630 --> 41:58.723
HI.

41:58.730 --> 42:00.755
CAN I HELP YOU ?

42:00.760 --> 42:03.126
I'D LIKE TO
SPEAK TO DAVID,

42:03.130 --> 42:04.654
IF AT ALL
POSSIBLE.

42:04.660 --> 42:05.820
WELL, HE'S NOT
HERE RIGHT NOW.

42:05.830 --> 42:07.457
WELL, WHERE
IS HE ?

42:07.460 --> 42:09.052
I'M NOT SURE.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.425
PERHAPS
I CAN HELP YOU.

42:10.430 --> 42:12.557
PERHAPS YOU CAN,
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.551
MY AUNT'S VIEWING
IS TOMORROW

42:14.560 --> 42:16.425
AND I'M NOT
AT ALL SATISFIED

42:16.430 --> 42:18.352
WITH THE STATE
OF HER CASKET.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.191
I SPOKE TO ONE OF
YOUR OTHER EMPLOYEES

42:20.200 --> 42:21.792
ABOUT IT EARLIER TODAY,

42:21.800 --> 42:24.052
AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE
THE SLIGHTEST BIT CONCERNED.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.028
I'LL SHOW YOU,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

42:28.930 --> 42:31.319
SEE ?
RIGHT HERE.

42:31.330 --> 42:33.525
IT'S BEEN NICKED.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.894
HOW 'BOUT WE TAKE
A HUNDRED BUCKS OFF ?

42:36.900 --> 42:39.050
I WANT A NEW CASKET.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.925
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S AN OPTION.

42:40.930 --> 42:42.329
WHY DOES NOBODY
AROUND HERE

42:42.330 --> 42:44.389
SEEM TO CARE ABOUT
DOING THINGS RIGHT ?!

42:45.400 --> 42:47.425
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

42:47.430 --> 42:49.523
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SIGNED
A CONTRACT, RIGHT ?

42:49.530 --> 42:50.952
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.791
SO YOU COULD TURN AROUND
AT THE END OF ALL THIS AND SAY,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.199
"I NEVER AGREED TO THAT",
AND REFUSE TO PAY ?

42:54.200 --> 42:55.849
OF COURSE NOT,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

42:55.860 --> 42:57.350
YEAH, THAT IS
RIDICULOUS.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.555
SO, I'M GONNA GO GET
THAT CONTRACT RIGHT NOW

42:59.560 --> 43:01.596
AND UNTIL YOU SIGN IT,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.194
YOU DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.657
I RESENT
YOUR IMPLICATION.

43:06.660 --> 43:08.252
YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKING
YOUR FUCKING STARS

43:08.260 --> 43:10.524
THAT YOU'RE ALIVE
AND HEALTHY,

43:10.530 --> 43:12.395
AND THAT YOU DON'T
LIVE IN A PLACE

43:12.400 --> 43:13.628
WHERE YOU HAVE
TO WORK LIKE A DOG

43:13.630 --> 43:15.393
JUST TO STARVE OR
GET SHOT IN THE STREET.

43:17.500 --> 43:20.253
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THAT CONTRACT.

43:33.460 --> 43:36.020
I THOUGHT THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.396
IT'S TOO LITTLE,
TOO LATE.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.552
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET YOUR WINGS ?

43:44.560 --> 43:47.688
WHERE'S YOUR
BOYFRIEND ?

43:47.700 --> 43:49.349
I DO LIKE HIM.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.294
YEAH, YOU SAID
THAT ALREADY.

43:51.300 --> 43:54.224
HE'LL BE HEADED OVER
TO MY NECK OF THE WOODS
PRETTY SOON !

45:30.800 --> 45:34.827
WHY YOU ARE HERE ?
YOU ARE FIRED.

45:34.830 --> 45:36.457
DEAR LORD,
HAVE YOU BEEN
HERE ALL NIGHT ?

45:36.460 --> 45:40.055
GO, DRIVE IN THE WOODS
WITH YOUR MAN

45:40.060 --> 45:43.359
WHO BURNS CHICKEN IN
THE FUNNY LITTLE TOY CAR.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.420
I CAME HERE
TO GET MY THINGS

45:46.430 --> 45:48.227
BEFORE I GO
TO CHURCH.

45:48.230 --> 45:50.892
I THOUGHT THIS
WOULD BE A SAFE TIME

45:50.900 --> 45:52.822
NOT TO RUN
INTO YOU.

45:53.830 --> 45:55.525
IS HE RICH ?

45:55.530 --> 45:56.690
WHAT ?

45:56.700 --> 45:57.655
NO.

45:59.230 --> 46:02.199
SO, HE IS
A GOOD LOVER, YEAH ?

46:02.200 --> 46:04.896
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

46:05.830 --> 46:08.048
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE KIND OF WOMAN

46:08.060 --> 46:10.449
WHO NEEDS
A GOOD LOVER.

46:10.460 --> 46:12.758
OH, AND
WHY IS THAT ?

46:14.460 --> 46:17.520
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO SCARED OF FEELING.

46:21.900 --> 46:25.119
YOU ARE SCARED
OF YOUR OWN HEART.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.621
YOU SHOULD HAVE A MAN
WHO CAN TOUCH YOU THERE.

46:29.630 --> 46:31.518
WHO SEES
YOUR BEAUTY.

46:34.900 --> 46:38.654
I HOPING HE IS
THIS MAN FOR YOU.

47:06.860 --> 47:09.624
IN YOUR STEADFAST
FAITH AND LOVE

47:09.630 --> 47:11.222
THAT THROUGH YOUR GRACE

47:11.230 --> 47:13.391
WE MAY PROCLAIM
YOUR TRUTH WITH BOLDNESS

47:13.400 --> 47:16.289
AND MINISTER YOUR JUSTICE
WITH COMPASSION

47:16.300 --> 47:18.928
FOR THE SAKE OF
OUR SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST,

47:18.930 --> 47:20.955
WHO LIVES AND
REIGNS WITH YOU

47:20.960 --> 47:22.655
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT,

47:22.660 --> 47:25.197
ONE GOD,
NOW AND FOREVER.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.020
AMEN.

47:27.030 --> 47:28.622
( congregation )
AMEN.

47:53.330 --> 47:56.424
"IN THEE, O LORD,
DO I PUT MY TRUST,

47:56.430 --> 47:58.796
"LET ME NEVER
BE ASHAMED,

47:58.800 --> 48:01.849
DELIVER ME IN
THY RIGHTEOUSNESS..."

48:09.730 --> 48:12.426
"LET ME NEVER
BE ASHAMED."

48:15.360 --> 48:18.090
UH, THERE'S
A CONCEPT.

48:25.830 --> 48:29.220
I'VE BEEN ASHAMED
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

48:29.230 --> 48:33.496
I GREW UP THINKING I WAS
UNWORTHY IN THE EYES OF GOD,

48:33.500 --> 48:35.320
INSTEAD OF TRUSTING GOD,

48:35.330 --> 48:38.595
NOT TO BE AN IGNORANT
FRIGHTENED BIGOT.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.597
BECAUSE OF THIS,
I'VE MADE MYSELF CRAZY.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.329
I'VE PUT MYSELF
IN DANGER,

48:45.330 --> 48:47.252
I'VE MADE A LOT
OF MISTAKES.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.727
BIG MISTAKES.

48:48.730 --> 48:51.722
WHICH ALL COULD
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

48:51.730 --> 48:53.459
IF I'D JUST HAD FAITH.

48:53.460 --> 48:55.690
FAITH THAT MAYBE
GOD REALLY IS LOVE,

48:55.700 --> 48:57.224
LIKE WE SAY.

49:01.830 --> 49:04.492
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SPREAD GOD'S LOVE

49:04.500 --> 49:07.389
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
WHEN I DENY IT TO MYSELF ?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.391
( applause )

49:17.500 --> 49:19.695
GOD BE WITH YOU ALL.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.058
( organ pipes up )

49:54.030 --> 49:56.248
( chattering )

49:59.400 --> 50:02.096
OH, DAVID,
WONDERFUL.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.749
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.091
THAN KS.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.359
THANK YOU.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.154
DAVID !

50:19.160 --> 50:21.196
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

50:21.200 --> 50:23.691
THAT WAS GREAT, DAVID.

50:23.700 --> 50:26.089
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.192
OH, COME ON.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.849
I HAD TO SEE WHAT
YOU WERE GONNA DO.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.259
WE'RE GOING TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT,

50:30.260 --> 50:31.625
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US ?

50:31.630 --> 50:33.222
YEAH, FRED 62
IN LOS FELIZ.

50:33.230 --> 50:34.629
MAYBE A MOVIE
AFTERWARDS.

50:34.630 --> 50:37.053
I CAN'T,
I'VE GOT TO WORK.

50:37.060 --> 50:39.949
OKAY, WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.450
YOU SPOKE THE TRUTH.

50:41.460 --> 50:42.893
THANK YOU.

50:45.330 --> 50:48.458
TAKE CARE.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.655
OKAY, WELL...

50:51.830 --> 50:53.798
DON'T BE A STRANGER.

51:09.430 --> 51:12.297
WE GO FOR BIG
BREAKFAST NOW, YEAH ?

51:12.300 --> 51:14.598
NO, I CAN'T,
I'M SORRY.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.249
BUT IS SUNDAY.

51:16.260 --> 51:18.854
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED CHURCH.

51:18.860 --> 51:21.397
MY SON WAS GIVING
A READING DURING
THE SERVICE.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.891
YOU ARE HAPPY, NO ?

51:23.900 --> 51:26.391
YES, I'M VERY HAPPY.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.798
I'M NEVER GOING TO
MARRY YOU.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.028
WHAT ?

51:36.030 --> 51:38.624
I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND
AND YOUR LOVER,

51:38.630 --> 51:40.757
BUT I WILL NEVER
BE YOUR WIFE.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.558
I SPENT THE FIRST HALF
OF MY LIFE DOING THAT,

51:43.560 --> 51:45.790
I DON'T NEED
TO DO IT AGAIN.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.525
MAYBE I CAN
CONVINCE YOU.

51:50.530 --> 51:51.519
NOPE.

51:51.530 --> 51:53.725
NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN.

52:14.230 --> 52:17.358
NATE, MOM TOLD ME
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,

52:17.360 --> 52:18.952
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

52:18.960 --> 52:19.927
YEAH.

52:19.930 --> 52:21.192
YEAH, I'M FINE.

52:21.200 --> 52:24.590
THANKS FOR MAKING TRACY
SIGN THAT CONTRACT.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.795
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE NOTICED THIS

52:26.800 --> 52:29.223
BUT SHE'S KINDA CRAZY.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.755
I GOT A WHIFF
OF THAT.

52:35.630 --> 52:38.827
AND THANKS FOR STAYING IN LA.
AND HELPING ME RUN THE BUSINESS.

52:38.830 --> 52:41.128
THINGS HAVE BEEN A LOT
MORE FUN AROUND HERE

52:41.130 --> 52:43.052
SINCE YOU'VE
BEEN HOME.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.153
WELL, THANK YOU, DAVE.

52:54.660 --> 52:57.959
LOOK, I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR AUGUSTO'S CHRISTENING.

52:57.960 --> 52:59.222
I GOTTA RUN.

52:59.230 --> 53:01.926
OH, THAT CRAZY-ASS NIECE
IS UPSTAIRS CRYING

53:01.930 --> 53:03.750
AND WON'T
COME DOWN.

53:06.660 --> 53:07.854
UH-UH.

53:07.860 --> 53:10.124
OH, NO, I THINK
THIS ONE IS YOURS.

53:10.130 --> 53:11.859
OKAY.

53:11.860 --> 53:13.953
BUT I'M WARNING YOU,

53:13.960 --> 53:15.757
I MIGHT JUST
FUCKING PUNCH HER.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.697
TRACY ?

54:00.330 --> 54:03.424
MY AUNT LILIAN
WAS THE ONLY PERSON

54:03.430 --> 54:05.898
WHO EVER REALLY
LOVED ME.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.997
MY PARENTS DIDN'T,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.628
MY HUSBAND
CERTAIN LY DIDN'T.

54:12.630 --> 54:16.452
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.950
HER HUSBAND DIED,

54:20.960 --> 54:22.689
AND HER DAUGHTER
DIED, TOO,

54:22.700 --> 54:25.351
IN THIS CAR CASH
ON HER 17th BIRTHDAY.

54:25.360 --> 54:29.296
BUT AUNT LILIAN
JUST WENT ON,

54:29.300 --> 54:32.690
SHE RAISED WELSH CORGIS,

54:32.700 --> 54:35.589
AND SHE TOOK UP
WATERCOLORS

54:35.600 --> 54:40.424
AND SHE LOVED ME,
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

54:46.200 --> 54:50.455
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS
ALONE IN THE WORLD.

54:50.460 --> 54:54.396
AND I'M USED
TO FEELING ALONE,

54:54.400 --> 54:56.652
I KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE,

54:56.660 --> 55:00.198
AND NOW I FIND OUT
THAT THERE'S THIS

55:00.200 --> 55:02.725
WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

55:09.630 --> 55:12.895
WHY DO PEOPLE
HAVE TO DIE ?

55:22.900 --> 55:25.551
TO MAKE LIFE
IMPORTANT.

55:25.560 --> 55:28.723
NONE OF US KNOW
HOW LONG WE'VE GOT,

55:28.730 --> 55:32.188
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE
TO MAKE EACH DAY MATTER.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.198
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR AUNT LILIAN

55:36.200 --> 55:38.350
DID EXACTLY THAT.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.521
YEAH, SHE DID.

55:40.530 --> 55:42.851
THEN YOU CAN BE
HAPPY FOR HER,

55:42.860 --> 55:44.999
FOR A LIFE WELL LIVED.

55:46.800 --> 55:50.019
THAT'S THE MOST
ANY OF US CAN HOPE FOR.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.198
I GO TO FUNERALS
SOMETIMES.

56:00.200 --> 56:04.398
FUNERALS OF PEOPLE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.894
"HAROLD AND MAUDE"
IS LIKE

56:07.900 --> 56:10.095
MY FAVORITE MOVIE
OF ALL TIME,

56:10.100 --> 56:12.056
I SAW IT WHEN I WAS
IN JUNIOR HIGH

56:12.060 --> 56:14.699
AND IT PROFOUNDLY
AFFECTED MY LIFE.

56:14.700 --> 56:16.952
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.

56:20.830 --> 56:23.355
YOU'RE VERY KIND.

56:26.730 --> 56:29.255
ARE YOU MARRIED ?

56:29.260 --> 56:31.524
SORT OF.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.350
COME ON IN.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.918
JULIO !

56:44.930 --> 56:46.852
GET OVER HERE !

56:46.860 --> 56:50.398
BABY, DOES THAT DEAD LADY
HAVE TO BE IN HERE ?

56:50.400 --> 56:53.528
NO, I'LL TAKE HER
DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.

56:55.630 --> 57:02.399
( music and chatter)

58:15.000 --> 58:17.389
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU ?

58:17.400 --> 58:20.255
I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT HOW LUCKY I AM.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.790
I LOVE YOU.

58:25.800 --> 58:28.428
YOU KNOW
THAT, RIGHT ?

58:28.430 --> 58:30.819
YEAH.
