00:01.835 --> 00:03.373
Ladies and gentlemen Todd Carr...

00:03.868 --> 00:06.228
Who took my precious little
novel, wiped his ass,

00:06.368 --> 00:09.129
and transformed it into
this "Crazy little thing called love"

00:13.894 --> 00:16.522
- Holy fucknuts!
- Shit!

00:17.022 --> 00:18.889
What, don't you fucking knock?

00:19.149 --> 00:22.327
You used to be all about the morning sex.
What's going on with you?

00:22.611 --> 00:24.603
- Anybody home?
- Hey, baby!

00:24.863 --> 00:26.747
Good afternoon, Mrs. Runkle.

00:27.115 --> 00:29.315
- What do you want me to do?
- Maybe you want me to...

00:29.455 --> 00:31.985
make you wear a ball gag
in your mouth.

00:32.244 --> 00:34.905
- You have to come get me.
- No, I can't do it. I'm a little busy right now.

00:35.165 --> 00:38.408
Asshole. My teacher is coked out,
he's trying to get me into a threesome.

00:38.668 --> 00:40.381
You wannna go to the movies with us, Dad?

00:40.528 --> 00:42.622
It turns out that was
bald old uncle Charlie,

00:42.623 --> 00:43.923
and he's going through a rough patch.

00:43.982 --> 00:44.957
Uncle Charlie, uh?

00:45.217 --> 00:47.751
- You cried wolf.
- Maybe I just wanted to see you.

00:48.011 --> 00:49.482
You're not in love with me, Hank.

00:49.622 --> 00:52.503
You're in love with the idea of love.

00:54.914 --> 00:56.463
You're running for the hills.

01:00.044 --> 01:03.274
subsbusters.com

01:06.800 --> 01:09.872
Okay, this is exciting.
I'm ready. I'm all ears.

01:11.558 --> 01:13.308
"Nothing gold can stay."

01:13.906 --> 01:17.817
- "Nature's first green... "
- Stop! I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

01:17.957 --> 01:20.551
You had 20 centuries of halfway
decent verse to choose from

01:20.691 --> 01:22.992
and you're going with some minor Frosty?

01:23.249 --> 01:24.386
I like it.

01:25.194 --> 01:27.324
- It's short.
- And?

01:28.524 --> 01:29.525
Bleak.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.445
And?

01:31.959 --> 01:33.907
I saw it in a movie once.

01:34.699 --> 01:36.758
Well, then, it must be good. continue.

01:37.147 --> 01:39.851
Well, basically it's about
how nothing good ever lasts,

01:39.991 --> 01:43.223
How, no matter what you do,
it all just turns to shit in the end...

01:43.607 --> 01:45.774
You know, like you and mom.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.251
Trenchant if profane literary criticism.
It's an interesting take.

01:50.391 --> 01:52.485
I will put that one on your tab,
by the way.

01:52.625 --> 01:55.813
But don't ever think that, honey.
Just because something is bleak doesn't...

01:56.057 --> 01:58.947
- necessarily make it true.
- Hair.

02:00.176 --> 02:03.246
Happy endings may get a bad rap,
but they do happen.

02:03.424 --> 02:06.788
And when they do, they're just
as true as the unhappy ones.

02:07.079 --> 02:10.876
So you're saying it's possible maybe one day
you and mom could get back together?

02:11.151 --> 02:14.842
- Of course. Anything's possible.
- Yes, but is it realistic

02:17.591 --> 02:19.841
Who says we have to be realistic?

02:20.173 --> 02:21.091
Mom.

02:23.998 --> 02:28.035
Not to contradict your dear old mom,
who's both wicked smart and wonderful,

02:28.195 --> 02:30.316
but, no, we don't have to be...
realistic, 

02:30.317 --> 02:32.717
that is not when it comes to love.

02:33.384 --> 02:35.462
Oh, Jeez. Is that Yusuf?

02:37.551 --> 02:38.904
Guess that's her.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.391
Got to change
what I'm feeding that dog... or you.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.118
Hello, sunshine.

02:47.258 --> 02:49.218
I'm double-parked,
so I just got to grab her.

02:49.358 --> 02:52.072
Oh I mean to skip the pleasantries.
But can you do me a favor and stop

02:52.236 --> 02:54.901
telling our daughter not to believe
in happy endings?

02:55.064 --> 02:56.784
What's next... no Santa Claus?

02:56.924 --> 02:58.197
You gonna shit all over
the Easter bunny, too?

02:58.644 --> 03:01.717
Oh, you Know, I don't think she figured out
the Santa Claus thing already,

03:01.857 --> 03:03.817
and I do believe in happy endings,

03:03.957 --> 03:06.539
just not when it comes
to the ballad of Hank and Karen.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.185
Bullshit. We practically made out last
week. That's nothing if not progress.

03:10.449 --> 03:13.762
- I hope to get to second base this week.
- Oh, please. that was an accident.

03:13.925 --> 03:15.523
- An accident?
- How your tongue

03:15.759 --> 03:17.943
- slipped into my mouth?
- No, other way around.

03:18.458 --> 03:21.113
and the fact that you're...
you're  making these lame excuses up

03:21.396 --> 03:24.408
can only mean one thing...
you're totally into me still.

03:24.732 --> 03:25.742
Oh, really?

03:26.006 --> 03:26.805
Totally.

03:29.928 --> 03:32.075
- Come on, honey.
- Goodbye, sweetie.

03:36.228 --> 03:38.434
Hey. Stay gold, ponyboy.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.786 --> 04:30.807
There is no fucking soy milk!

04:32.085 --> 04:34.308
Will you nut up
and learn to digest dairy?

04:34.725 --> 04:36.351
What the fuck is wrong with you?

04:36.491 --> 04:39.107
Nothing a brand-new
gastrointestinal tract wouldn't fix.

04:39.377 --> 04:40.941
Bullshit. Here.

04:41.128 --> 04:43.711
It's not vanilla, but you
can punish me for that later.

04:43.870 --> 04:45.584
I'll dust off the whips and chains.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.585
ah, ah, ah

04:46.599 --> 04:47.750
Very funny.

04:47.890 --> 04:50.617
Seriously. I've been
a very naughty hausfrau.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.543
You almost died from malnutrition.

04:52.747 --> 04:55.251
These jokes are never
gonna get old, are they?

04:55.391 --> 04:57.318
What is a marriage,
if not an opportunity

04:57.458 --> 05:01.585
to mock someone through thick and thin
while simultaneously exploring

05:01.725 --> 05:03.750
your deepest, darkest sexual desires?

05:03.890 --> 05:08.053
Yeah, well, uh, what say one day soon 
we lay off mine and start discussing yours?

05:08.658 --> 05:11.473
- Like you could handle that.
- Oh, Oh, do you want to try me?

05:12.374 --> 05:13.961
I want to do it with a girl.

05:18.330 --> 05:19.541
So, uh,

05:19.996 --> 05:23.374
What? this is something you, uh,
feel you might... enjoy?

05:24.014 --> 05:26.318
Yeah, sure. I hear it's nice, you know?

05:26.458 --> 05:29.407
Getting a little work done by someone
who owns her own set of tools.

05:29.768 --> 05:33.118
But I wouldn't want to leave you out.
It seems more...

05:33.274 --> 05:35.461
I don't know, honest that way.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.158
Honest... Right.

05:40.016 --> 05:41.951
Don't you see what this means?

05:42.091 --> 05:44.141
This is a gift from on high.

05:44.424 --> 05:46.800
This is a cosmic
"get out of jail free" card.

05:47.185 --> 05:49.351
The whole thing was her idea.

05:49.491 --> 05:51.384
I'm trying to mentally
masturbate about it,

05:51.524 --> 05:54.349
but an image of you keeps popping.
That's a problem.

05:54.628 --> 05:57.164
<i>No, see, if I do this...
if we do this thing,</i>

05:57.324 --> 05:59.793
then all this guilt I've been
carrying around for weeks...

05:59.958 --> 06:03.098
The massive, crushing guilt...
poof, that is gone.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.567
I am absolved.

06:05.572 --> 06:07.987
I know you Hebrews do things
a little differently,

06:08.255 --> 06:10.375
<i>but last I checked,
a ménage à trois</i>

06:10.516 --> 06:12.700
was not a pit stop
on the road to redemption.

06:13.224 --> 06:14.911
This could save the marriage.

06:15.352 --> 06:17.218
So can buying a beach house.

06:17.358 --> 06:20.184
Or you could try adopting
an incredibly good-looking African baby.

06:20.324 --> 06:23.194
- I hear good things about that.
- Speaking of...

06:24.690 --> 06:27.084
You got to be fucking kidding me.
That cocksucker?

06:27.248 --> 06:29.755
That cocksucker has the taste
to want to option your blog

06:29.902 --> 06:33.312
- for a nice chunk of change, so play nice.
- How the fuck you option a blog?

06:33.458 --> 06:35.682
What is there to option?
The title? The font?

06:36.052 --> 06:38.351
Todd! Good to see you, man.

06:38.491 --> 06:40.084
Glad you could make it.

06:40.385 --> 06:41.085
Moody

06:41.186 --> 06:41.886
Carr

06:42.008 --> 06:45.485
I would stand, but that would expose
my nether-regions to attack.

06:46.475 --> 06:49.123
I got no beef with you, Moody.
I'm here on business.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.725
So I'm told
by the Alfredo Corleone of agents.

06:51.905 --> 06:54.880
Although I can't, for the life of me, imagine
what that business might be,

06:55.077 --> 06:57.787
unless it's to discuss custody
of our retarded love child.

06:58.052 --> 06:59.706
Let the man talk, will you?

06:59.950 --> 07:02.084
Todd has a three-picture
deal at Paramount.

07:02.224 --> 07:05.337
He's looking to get his sack back
with some seriously edgy material.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.655
I'm sorry, but my testicles
are not available for time-share.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.301
- I told you, this was a waste of my fucking time.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, it's just...

07:11.568 --> 07:15.471
Do you know how much shit I had to take
for directing a frothy little rom com?

07:15.783 --> 07:18.252
You think Antoine Fuqua
returns my calls?

07:18.506 --> 07:19.661
But I did it.

07:19.829 --> 07:22.015
I knocked that motherfucker
into the cheap seats.

07:22.253 --> 07:24.351
And I'm glad I did it. Do you know why?

07:24.491 --> 07:27.066
Because it keeps the baby mamas
in juicy couture?

07:28.005 --> 07:30.069
No, hey, I'm not hating.

07:30.351 --> 07:32.851
I'm not judging.
I got a little baby mama all my own.

07:32.991 --> 07:36.266
It's true. He does.
I'm sensing some common ground here.

07:36.408 --> 07:37.667
Do you remember Karen?

07:37.814 --> 07:40.163
Yeah, she was way
too fucking hot for this mope.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.414
Ttrue. She is.

07:41.593 --> 07:44.918
She also happens to be one
fan-fucking-tastic architect.

07:45.190 --> 07:48.087
Is someone looking to pimp out
the McMansion in Baldwin Wills?

07:48.359 --> 07:50.231
I own a Ray fucking Kappe house.

07:50.232 --> 07:51.432
Ray fucking Kappe house

07:51.531 --> 07:54.710
No shit. Guy has a hard-on for
architecture bigger than Brad Pitt's.

07:54.890 --> 07:57.396
<i>- Oh, Color Me Impressed.
- What, a brother can't love modernism?</i>

07:57.397 --> 07:58.197
I like this

07:58.258 --> 08:01.092
I like this.
uh, you know, We're free-associating here.

08:01.242 --> 08:04.577
This is Nice. The lines of communication...
wide open. Excellent.

08:04.908 --> 08:06.968
Do you know why I wanted to
work with you again, Moody?

08:07.229 --> 08:09.817
Because when you're not wallowing
in narcissistic despair,

08:10.144 --> 08:12.684
you're the rarest thing
this town has to offer...

08:12.824 --> 08:14.530
Someone with some goddamn vision.

08:15.065 --> 08:18.479
I thought it was 'cause you liked
the feel of my balls on your knuckles.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.641
Later, Runkle.

08:26.785 --> 08:28.208
Well done, my friend.

08:29.057 --> 08:31.307
I don't know. I feel like we bonded.

08:37.716 --> 08:40.726
Who the fuck is answering
my fucking phones if there's...

08:43.023 --> 08:47.107
Baby, where have you been?
I had a burst of inspiration.

08:47.416 --> 08:49.074
- Come here, you.
- Hello.

08:50.091 --> 08:53.341
So I was talking to Dani here
about our sexual problem.

08:53.685 --> 08:56.174
- Our what?
- She's totally in.

08:57.081 --> 09:00.189
- Excuse me?
- Her, me, you.

09:00.547 --> 09:02.885
We had a little girl-to-girl
chat on the subject,

09:03.025 --> 09:05.776
and she agrees with me
about the toolbox thing.

09:06.502 --> 09:07.523
Oh, shit.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.033
I said "tool."

09:10.601 --> 09:11.671
and "box."

09:12.172 --> 09:12.972
Ok

09:13.170 --> 09:15.351
Uh, Dani, could you give us just a second, please?

09:15.491 --> 09:18.184
I believe my wife forgot to take
her Librium this morning.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.859
No problem, Sir.

09:20.103 --> 09:22.779
So, hold all your calls?

09:22.957 --> 09:25.501
- Yes, Dani, hold all my calls.
- Very good, Sir.

09:31.253 --> 09:33.808
Wife, have you lost
your fucking mind?

09:34.244 --> 09:37.084
This is perfect.
It's exactly what we talked about.

09:37.235 --> 09:39.865
Yeah, <I>talked...  as in
hypothetical conversation.

09:40.161 --> 09:41.909
That's my fucking secretary!

09:42.423 --> 09:43.223
So?

09:43.775 --> 09:46.151
So, if it goes badly,
I'll have to fire her.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.415
Shit, if it goes well,
I'd have to fire her.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.767
Either way, I'm out one fucking
secretary and up a giant lawsuit.

09:51.908 --> 09:53.712
I thought you said she was god-awful?

09:55.186 --> 09:58.842
They're all god-awful
until you train them. Then they improve.

09:59.122 --> 10:00.808
What, like dogs?

10:00.991 --> 10:03.389
Come on. You're not
gonna do this for me?

10:03.696 --> 10:06.684
- I helped you out with your fantasy.
- Yeah, badly.

10:08.655 --> 10:10.688
Just pick someone else, that's all.

10:10.966 --> 10:13.817
- Like who?
- Who? I don't know... somebody, anybody.

10:14.005 --> 10:17.828
Someone...someone from the salon or, uh...
What about Karen?

10:19.485 --> 10:21.043
The prim reaper?

10:21.489 --> 10:24.448
She's so tall... and Presbyterian.

10:24.709 --> 10:28.223
- The woman's a goddess. She's gorgeous.
- I don't wanna go where Hank has been.

10:28.372 --> 10:31.494
He probably left booby traps
up there like the Vietcong.

10:32.545 --> 10:34.981
Come on, baby... Please?

10:35.625 --> 10:38.966
I want the little one.
She looks like she knows things.

10:45.032 --> 10:47.014
- Oh, my god.
- You like?

10:47.156 --> 10:49.750
Well, yeah, of course I like.
It's a Ray Kappe house.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.019
Ray fucking Kappe.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.633
That's one of those guys
from architecture school

10:53.888 --> 10:55.468
who got you all juiced up.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.217
I thought maybe you'd like to see one
all up close and personal, right?

10:58.257 --> 10:59.956
hey Hank, can you get back in the car?

11:00.419 --> 11:03.473
We're gonna get tasered
by the Bel-Air patrol.

11:03.891 --> 11:04.933
My lady.

11:06.881 --> 11:08.073
What are you doing?

11:08.524 --> 11:11.674
Just made a little deal
with the caramel-coated devil.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.028
Tasering... you like that?

11:14.184 --> 11:16.086
Is that something you're into now?

11:16.521 --> 11:18.041
Oh, my God.

11:18.441 --> 11:21.842
- It's fucking gorgeous, huh?
- Not a lot of closet space, though.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.884
Hank never really got
architecture as an art form.

11:25.024 --> 11:27.806
Too much compromise involved,
too many practicalities.

11:28.098 --> 11:31.348
Dude would rather hang out all alone
in his ivory tower, right?

11:31.540 --> 11:33.850
Massaging those precious
little words of his.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.638
Like anyone gives a fuck if it's
an "and" instead of "or."

11:36.825 --> 11:40.418
You got me all wrong.
You see, I try to live in an ivory tower,

11:40.558 --> 11:43.259
but a tide of shit is
constantly beating at its walls.

11:43.407 --> 11:45.416
Don't be impressed.
He stole it from Flaubert.

11:45.558 --> 11:49.219
Ehy Carr, if you don't mind my asking,
how much a place like this set you back?

11:49.423 --> 11:52.586
The feeling of real architecture...
You can't put a price tag on that.

11:52.782 --> 11:56.418
- So you <I>do mind.
- Makes your heart soar, lifts your soul.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.086
<I>you know what I mean.

11:58.358 --> 12:00.198
It's just incredible.

12:01.004 --> 12:04.211
- I think it was Ruskin who once said...
- "It was Ruskin..."

12:04.456 --> 12:05.502
Shut up.

12:05.679 --> 12:08.883
"Without architecture,
there would be no remembering."

12:09.809 --> 12:12.191
- I like that. That's nice.
- Yeah, it's cool.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.841
About 4, 5 mill?

12:14.893 --> 12:16.528
- More?
- I'm so sorry.

12:18.168 --> 12:20.032
Can I just say thank you so much?

12:20.335 --> 12:23.251
It's always been a dream of mine
to see inside this house.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.089
- I really appreciate your time.
- It's gonna be even more slick

12:27.269 --> 12:29.820
when I have a pool out here,
a little guest house,

12:29.983 --> 12:33.795
maybe a screening room.
And I want it all to be eco-friendly and shit

12:33.937 --> 12:36.054
Hank says you're some kind
of genius at that.

12:36.201 --> 12:38.973
- No, I mean...
- I was hoping you would take the job.

12:39.591 --> 12:41.873
- What job?
- Did I forget to mention

12:42.020 --> 12:44.586
that Carr here
is looking for an architect?

12:45.030 --> 12:47.188
- I think my work here is done.
- Me?

12:48.090 --> 12:49.382
What do you think?

12:49.886 --> 12:50.991
Oh My God!

12:52.584 --> 12:53.810
Oh. I like that.

12:56.115 --> 12:57.918
Yuo wanna jump my bones now or hold on

12:57.958 --> 12:59.985
for a situation
with a little more back support?

13:02.531 --> 13:04.693
- I did good, didn't I?
- You did!

13:04.857 --> 13:08.082
- Thank you so much. I'm so excited.
- You're welcome.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.439
Will you take me home
so I can celebrate?

13:10.592 --> 13:12.823
<i>I'm up for that.
Let's hit El pollo loco.</i>

13:13.018 --> 13:14.748
- I mean with Becca.
- Her too.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.580
The "crazy chicken"
does not discriminate.

13:17.322 --> 13:19.184
All right, it's a...
Wednesday night, I forgot.

13:19.324 --> 13:21.501
Okay, well, I can celebrate
some other time.

13:21.681 --> 13:24.547
You will not stay home alone
on the night of your big victory.

13:24.689 --> 13:26.972
- No, unacceptable.
- You'd swap nights with me?

13:27.131 --> 13:29.499
Sadly, no, but I will repeat
my original offer

13:29.679 --> 13:32.184
that all three of us
throw down the carbs together...

13:32.348 --> 13:35.438
Man, woman, and child.
You wanted to celebrate, come on!

13:36.052 --> 13:38.701
- Not with you.
- I want to celebrate with you.

13:38.848 --> 13:40.513
- Invite me over.
- No.

13:40.670 --> 13:43.874
Invite me over!
I will cook for you.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.362
- Cook? You?
- Yes.

13:47.636 --> 13:50.506
- I have my one dish.
- Not the "cheese sensation".

13:50.768 --> 13:52.959
Yes, five different kinds
of cheeses,

13:53.149 --> 13:55.844
including cream cheese,
the people's cheese.

13:57.577 --> 14:00.242
Don't knock the haute cuisine
of Long Island.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.842
- It'll be like old times.
- Yeah, but which ones?

14:02.989 --> 14:04.262
The good ones, like

14:04.409 --> 14:06.682
when we lived on Charles Street,
among the gays.

14:06.823 --> 14:08.980
- You hated that place.
- But you loved it.

14:09.128 --> 14:11.531
Just like you love
fucked-up architecture like this

14:11.678 --> 14:13.936
David Hockney, gigantic fucking earrings

14:14.160 --> 14:17.641
and the complete and utter cliché
of driving west on Mulholland at sunset.

14:19.402 --> 14:21.897
You think I don't know
these things, but I do.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.987
I'm in, aren't I?

14:28.753 --> 14:29.816
I'm in.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.256
How do I look?

14:46.296 --> 14:48.045
Good...you look good.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.457
You think she likes nuts?

14:53.621 --> 14:55.684
Maybe we should offer her
some mixed nuts.

14:55.824 --> 14:56.864
I don't know.

14:57.658 --> 14:59.295
What? You think she's allergic?

14:59.337 --> 15:03.177
I don't know...how the fuck should I know
something like that? I don't know.

15:03.324 --> 15:06.904
You work with people, these things
come up in casual conversation.

15:07.051 --> 15:09.369
"None for me, thanks.
I have a nut allergy."

15:09.511 --> 15:11.901
I'm sorry. We don't have
that kind of relationship.

15:12.048 --> 15:14.386
Really, I don't know very much
about this girl.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.963
Other than you think
that she's fucking hot.

15:17.111 --> 15:19.220
How am I supposed to respond to that?

15:19.367 --> 15:22.437
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say, "I love you,

15:22.600 --> 15:24.742
"this is fucking crazy.
let's not do this"?

15:24.902 --> 15:27.608
Ehy, don't yell at me, asswipe!
I am nervous enough as it is!

15:27.762 --> 15:30.362
- Yeah, and isn't that a sign?
- A sign of what?

15:30.526 --> 15:34.221
That we shouldn't go through with this!
I mean, look what we have here.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.141
This is pretty great, right?

15:36.305 --> 15:38.675
How do we know we're gonna
be the same afterwards?

15:38.870 --> 15:39.870
The same?

15:40.012 --> 15:41.944
I thought the same was the problem.

15:42.105 --> 15:44.595
What problem? there's no problem.

15:51.574 --> 15:53.740
Do you want to get that, or should I?

16:20.761 --> 16:23.084
Yeah. I'm gonna be there in like five...

16:24.861 --> 16:26.228
Hello, Mia? Yes.

16:28.854 --> 16:32.298
No, I'm sure you're in trouble.
That just... It sounds...

16:32.462 --> 16:36.430
It sounds pretty tragic, actually.
Quite a story. Very familiar, too.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.711
Oh, that's right. I heard it last week.

16:39.212 --> 16:39.812
ciao

17:03.788 --> 17:07.563
Where did you get that bra?
That is so cute, i love...

17:09.188 --> 17:11.553
Sorry. My bad. Mood killer.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.562
You're not gonna fist me or anything,
are you?

17:39.722 --> 17:42.309
- because I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
- Marce!

17:43.358 --> 17:46.456
- What?
- A little less talk might be nice.

17:46.947 --> 17:48.769
Everybody's a fucking critic.

17:49.999 --> 17:52.240
Put me in, coach.
I'll bring it home for you.

17:57.078 --> 17:59.538
Do you think we should...
I don't know...

17:59.729 --> 18:01.273
Include him somehow?

18:02.041 --> 18:03.476
It's your fantasy.

18:08.461 --> 18:09.461
Hello?

18:10.189 --> 18:11.282
I'm thinking.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.154
I mean, shit, I can sleep
with you any night of the week.

18:15.318 --> 18:18.632
- It's not how this is supposed to be.
- It's a fantasy.

18:19.069 --> 18:21.147
it's not supposed to be at all.

18:32.508 --> 18:34.824
Hey. Thank god you're here.
Okay, sweetie.

18:35.078 --> 18:36.864
- I gotta go.
- Where you going?

18:37.257 --> 18:39.731
Mia's in some fucked-up situation
with her teacher.

18:39.897 --> 18:42.046
She's kind of drunk or drugs,
I don't know.

18:42.214 --> 18:45.720
- I'm gonna come with you.
- Not your problem. Stay with Becca.

18:46.540 --> 18:50.009
You don't know this guy.
It's a sex crime waiting to happen, just hang on

18:50.186 --> 18:52.883
25 minutes at 300, okay?
Throw that in the oven.

18:53.054 --> 18:54.967
- Why are you going?
- Because I have to.

18:55.107 --> 18:56.984
No, you don't. It's just Mia.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.631
- Last I've checked you guys aren't blood-related.
- Right.

18:59.810 --> 19:02.654
- Your mother needs backup.
- No, I don't!

19:02.915 --> 19:05.324
Can you stay with Becca?
She's been waiting for you.

19:05.476 --> 19:07.306
You can't handle this guy alone!

19:08.548 --> 19:10.571
He doesn't look it, but he's dangerous.

19:10.725 --> 19:12.653
I think he's dan... Just let me drive.

19:12.826 --> 19:15.625
I'll drive you there.
We'll go. We'll go together.

19:49.491 --> 19:50.491
Here.

19:50.878 --> 19:52.634
Do with it what you will.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.057
Or maybe...

19:55.063 --> 19:57.714
... you can dish it out
but can't take it.

19:58.506 --> 20:01.826
Is this gonna hurt?
'Cause this looks like it might hurt.

20:02.174 --> 20:04.251
That's kind of the point, isn't it?

20:05.417 --> 20:07.904
I mean, he's done
some pretty bad things, this guy.

20:08.369 --> 20:10.505
He deserves to be punished for them.

20:12.246 --> 20:13.695
Things like what?

20:13.941 --> 20:15.444
You know, the usual.

20:20.644 --> 20:23.295
Oh, man. I got to get my camera.

20:24.877 --> 20:27.733
Motherfucker! Cocksucker! Shit! Fuck!

20:27.966 --> 20:30.207
You're attached to the fucking chain!

20:30.491 --> 20:33.224
Just don't move!
Get it off your underwear!

20:38.633 --> 20:42.268
Finally. You guys gotta get this fucking
jailbait out of my house.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.486
Honey, it's me. It's Karen.

20:44.628 --> 20:46.036
Hey, hey, wake up.

20:46.184 --> 20:48.958
You know, this isn't just alcohol.
She's taken something.

20:49.436 --> 20:51.651
Hey, Mia. Wake up!

20:52.535 --> 20:54.543
Hank, you came.

20:54.948 --> 20:56.779
What the fuck's she talking about?

20:56.977 --> 20:57.977
"You came"?

20:58.119 --> 21:00.688
I don't know. She's confused.
keep your eyes open.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.688
Look at me. Keep your eyes open.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.365
Animal, what'd you give her?

21:04.529 --> 21:06.561
You think I set a fucking date-rape drug?

21:06.795 --> 21:10.132
Valium, for Christ's sakes. The girl's
got a goddamn rite aid in her purse.

21:10.290 --> 21:12.110
How many did you take?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.155
What? 5, 4?

21:15.346 --> 21:17.109
45? 4 or 5.

21:17.491 --> 21:19.815
See? Nobody's gonna off themselves
with 4.

21:19.992 --> 21:21.220
It's all an act.

21:21.362 --> 21:24.855
You know how fucking popular
this shit is with the young ladies?

21:24.997 --> 21:26.344
Do you think it's funny?

21:26.815 --> 21:29.447
This is someone's child here,
you asshole!

21:29.631 --> 21:30.851
They trusted you!

21:31.333 --> 21:33.379
You are meant to be her teacher!

21:33.672 --> 21:35.986
You think I wanted Sylvia Plath
to come here

21:36.128 --> 21:39.281
<i>and go all fucking Bell Jar on me?
I'm the one getting manipulated here.</i>

21:39.482 --> 21:42.025
She comes up to me
after fucking debate practice...

21:42.244 --> 21:43.857
Do you want me to smack you?

21:45.199 --> 21:46.199
Oh, shit.

21:46.415 --> 21:49.962
- I bet she feels a lot better now.
- Oh, no, she did not just fucking...

21:50.104 --> 21:51.799
- I see two.
- Two what?

21:52.004 --> 21:53.736
2 pills. Is that a 3rd one there?

21:53.914 --> 21:56.289
Look, I assume that's sushi.
Is that a pill?

21:57.376 --> 21:59.426
Let's get the fuck out of here.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.025
Ah, shit, Moody!

22:02.135 --> 22:04.062
<i>Now I'm gonna fucking hurl.</i>

22:06.350 --> 22:07.350
Fuck!

22:10.776 --> 22:13.245
Who's your primary care guy again?

22:13.387 --> 22:15.076
How should I fucking know?

22:15.218 --> 22:18.163
Jesus Christ, You think these people are ever
gonna get around to sewing me up?

22:18.305 --> 22:20.642
I'm in considerable fucking pain here!

22:20.909 --> 22:23.599
I'm sorry, okay?
I said it a thousand times.

22:23.741 --> 22:25.729
You know I'm bad with mechanical things.

22:25.879 --> 22:29.817
Tell that to my missing nipple.
You took off like 12 layers of skin.

22:31.105 --> 22:32.403
I'm sorry, nipple.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.373
Now that I've maimed you,
where am I gonna rest my head?

22:37.537 --> 22:39.618
That was like my favorite spot.

22:43.909 --> 22:45.139
Some fantasy, uh?

22:46.123 --> 22:48.487
How the fuck did we end up here?

22:49.622 --> 22:51.932
On some level,
I think you wanted to punish me.

22:52.098 --> 22:55.149
<i>- I think you both wanted to punish me.
- For what?</i>

22:55.291 --> 22:57.896
Shit, you know... Everything.
Husband stuff.

22:58.038 --> 22:59.475
Not me, dickwad. Her!

22:59.616 --> 23:01.601
Why the fuck
would she wanna punish you?

23:01.743 --> 23:03.687
She barely knows you.
What the fuck does she care?

23:03.831 --> 23:04.910
I'm her boss, ok?

23:05.061 --> 23:07.124
I make her do
humiliating things all day.

23:07.266 --> 23:08.751
You think she likes that?

23:09.631 --> 23:10.631
What?

23:14.024 --> 23:15.412
You leaned wrong.

23:16.284 --> 23:17.284
I'm sorry.

23:19.772 --> 23:22.533
She's an interesting girl,
though, that one.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.403
Fantastic ass.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.725
How is she?

23:31.572 --> 23:32.980
Even if she's fine,

23:33.595 --> 23:37.355
she's gonna feel like seven different kinds 
of shit tomorrow, that's for sure

23:37.614 --> 23:38.995
You gonna tell Bill?

23:39.596 --> 23:41.915
Well, yeah. I mean, I have to, right?

23:42.135 --> 23:44.760
Wouldn't you want to know?
if your 16-year-old daughter

23:44.924 --> 23:48.099
was hanging out with some creepy perv
who's like twice her age?

23:48.255 --> 23:51.343
The situation may not be
exactly as it seems.

23:51.544 --> 23:52.980
You've got to be kidding.

23:53.122 --> 23:55.408
- You're on the side of the perv, right?
- Always.

23:55.555 --> 23:58.036
Somebody's gotta stand up
for the creepy common man.

23:58.269 --> 24:01.024
You know, that should be
a lesson to you, Hank Moody.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.076
To me? A lesson to me? Why?

24:05.194 --> 24:09.147
- Why did you point your finger at me?
- I'm just kidding, it's okay.

24:09.757 --> 24:12.846
You're a great dad.
You have nothing to worry about.

24:13.365 --> 24:16.037
I mean, that's the sexiest
thing about you.

24:18.259 --> 24:20.145
You want to say good night to Becca?

24:20.742 --> 24:21.742
Please.

24:22.117 --> 24:23.117
Go, then.

24:24.358 --> 24:26.451
You know, you did need
my backup tonight.

24:26.642 --> 24:30.005
You might have killed that guy probably
if I wasn't there, you know?

24:45.173 --> 24:45.973
Dad?

24:46.603 --> 24:47.603
Hey.

24:48.489 --> 24:51.885
What are you listening to, there?
A little falling-asleep music?

24:52.396 --> 24:55.171
<i>Little Joni Mitchell,
Blood on the tracks?</i>

24:56.455 --> 24:57.918
<i>Death cab for cutie.</i>

24:58.519 --> 25:00.740
wow, You really know how to hurt a guy.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.516
I know tonight...

25:07.378 --> 25:09.346
kind of got a little ruined.

25:10.344 --> 25:12.749
It's okay. I'm used to it.

25:13.159 --> 25:16.412
Yeah, well, I'll make it up to you,
I swear.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.085
- I know.
- Do you?

25:21.038 --> 25:23.823
Sure. You never mean to let me down.

25:25.793 --> 25:27.125
But you do.

25:29.633 --> 25:31.096
Yeah, I guess I do.

25:33.399 --> 25:37.068
You know, it's all well and good
to talk about happy endings.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.706
But if a person can't deliver,

25:40.642 --> 25:42.378
if he keeps screwing up,

25:44.414 --> 25:46.068
well, eventually, I guess

25:46.210 --> 25:48.670
you kind of just have to say,
"fuck you,"

25:52.683 --> 25:54.432
or words to that effect.

26:06.944 --> 26:08.612
You can keep the change.
