This is not happening. It is happening.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.204
It is happening. Please tell me it's not.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.622
And you got to breathe through it.

No. Breathe. I'm breathing.

Hey, you guys. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Yes? You might not know this,

01:34.762 --> 01:38.097
In addition to class president,

01:38.139 --> 01:40.642
I think I should also be captain of the soccer team.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.061
M-Maybe we can come up with, like,

01:42.101 --> 01:46.231
um, a more realistic arrangement, you know?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.942
Something like shoes.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.484
Really? Women love shoes.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.362
Wow, misogynistic much?

01:52.404 --> 01:54.448
But I don't hate the idea.

No, no, no, that's not -- that's not helping.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.917
Let's, you know -- Okay, let's take a quick recap.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.335
The presidency thing is gonna be hard, to be honest.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.421
Because people don't like you. No one likes you.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.006
Your name is Ava for Christ's sake.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.258

We're teenagers.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.990
Did she say that to you, or...

08:52.032 --> 08:54.117
She likes him, or she likes me, or she likes both of us?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.244
Tell her -- Tell her -- Just what exactly what she said.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.747
Well, was

08:56.286 --> 08:59.747
Me a little bit more?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.833
Shitheads, focus.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.461
Yeah, what are your intentions with my girl Izzy?

09:04.503 --> 09:06.963
'Cause she came really upset this morning.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.965
And I'm not convinced that it's in her best interest

09:09.007 --> 09:10.258
to continue seeing you guys.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.427
She was upset? So convince me.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.554
Well, you know what? We -- We're not --

09:14.595 --> 09:17.474
We don't have time or the energy to convince anyone of anything.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.852
So why don't you just go back to your client, okay,

09:20.894 --> 09:23.021
before I tell the manager that, you know,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.981
you're hooking at his bar.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.608
Uh, I'm a escort

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
like your girlfriend, not a hooker.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.905
It's just... It's very blurred.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.948
What is she doing? I am confused.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.783
Hey, Billy.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.994
Does she work here? I don't know.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.913
The manager of this old-person utopia

09:39.954 --> 09:41.540
is one of my best clients.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.624
No, thank you. Drink.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.671
Uncle Jack... Yes.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.216
...if you try and jump my shit one more time,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.842
this is gonna end really poorly.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.553
Is that clear

09:54.594 --> 09:56.179
I'm not trying to jump. I'm not trying to do anything.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.349
Listen, I don't know what your thing is --

09:59.391 --> 10:01.851
Look, guys, I'm just a loyal friend

10:01.893 --> 10:03.978
who held Izzy while she cried this morning.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.065
We wrestled really hard, but then we hugged it out again.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.733
Sounds complicated.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.985
Just shouldn't have said the thing about the wrestling.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.988
Look, my point -- my point is,

10:14.030 --> 10:15.782
is that I'm gonna be the one

10:15.823 --> 10:18.910
putting the piece of Izzy back together after you guys move on.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.620
So what's the deal?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.163
Are you guys really breaking up with her?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.873
No. No.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.917
No, we can't break up with her. We were never really with her.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.044
Bullshit. And you know it.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.130
Mnh-mnh. No, it's true.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.130
We -- We -- We don't --

10:30.171 --> 10:31.881
We just, you know -- We want to put it --

10:31.923 --> 10:34.008
We're all on the same team here. We're all on the same team.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.052
We are, you know -- We're going back to the beginning.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.052
Fuck you.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.012
We're putting it back and making it

10:38.054 --> 10:40.223
a finite business arrangement. Finite business arrangement.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.849
I could maybe get behind that.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.602
Really? Write the check.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.062
Stop fucking around.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.648
♪♪

10:48.689 --> 10:53.987
Okay. So, just so I'm clear on what you're asking of us.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.698
You want us to cover for you for the duration

10:57.740 --> 11:00.034
of this deranged program that you're on.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.995
And that's it

11:02.036 --> 11:03.413
Yep.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.248
I mean this is Hawthorne Heights, right?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.459
It's not some sex commune.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.377
Okay, but are there really sex communes?

11:09.419 --> 11:11.212
They're all sex communes, yes.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.214
When you hear commune, you don't even need the sex part.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.799
That's all they're doing is sex.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.384
I mean, we have kids, you know?

11:16.426 --> 11:18.261
Everybody in the neighborhood has kids.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.221
That's why you come to this neighborhood.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.764
You have kids. You settle down.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.183
You pump 'em out, you know?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.352
That -- I'm sorry. That's insensitive.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.020
You're working on it. It's gonna happen.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.022
It's definitely gonna happen for you two, I believe it.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.191
Okay. Okay. Move on now.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.109
Okay. Nah, it's okay.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.655
We just let it get away from us a little bit, to be honest.

11:36.695 --> 11:41.034
We mistook it for something it never really could be.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.204
Okay, but, Em, you are pressing reset, right?

11:44.245 --> 11:47.290
You're putting it back to a 4

11:48.625 --> 11:50.335
Like, writing a new check?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.379
Yes, exactly.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.466
Yeah. We say Izzy went back to Syracuse with her mother,

11:56.508 --> 11:58.426
who -- who's my sister.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.596
Yeah. I'm sure this murky gumbo of bullshit

12:01.638 --> 12:04.098
won't come back to haunt you in any way, shape, or form.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.394
Okay.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.770
All we have to do is lie our asses off

12:09.812 --> 12:11.523
for the remainder of the contract, right?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.816
Yep. That's good practice.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.694
You know, in a few years, we're gonna have to lie

12:15.734 --> 12:17.612
to our own kids and tell them we never smoked weed

12:17.654 --> 12:19.280
or ate shrooms like they were dried fruit.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.450
Though there is one other disturbing new twist.

12:22.492 --> 12:26.705
Ava Matherfield knows, and she's blackmailing us.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.831
Ava knows? Yep.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.542
And you want us to help you kill her?

12:30.584 --> 12:33.044
Why does it always circle back to murder with you two?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.547
This neighborhood's going to hell.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.299
That's what's happening here. Going right to hell.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.682
Nice. Let's get this going before the hangover kicks in.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.142
Said the spiraling alcoholic.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.353
I don't know. Every-- Everything I type

12:50.395 --> 12:51.979
makes us sound like dicks, you know?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.981
It's like nothing nice

12:54.023 --> 12:56.276
ever comes after "from this point forward."

12:56.317 --> 12:58.737
Yeah, but we've got to

12:58.777 --> 13:00.779
Hey. Hi.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.031
You're here!

13:02.073 --> 13:03.491
Yeah. Sorry.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.660
Whoops. Wearing pajamas.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.994
I am.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.829
Is that a tent? It is.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.960
We were actually just texting you.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.670
Oh, what does it say?

13:15.712 --> 13:17.171
Nothing.

13:17.213 --> 13:21.050
It's -- We can just tell you now because you're here.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.678
Is it, uh, you guys are breaking up with me?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.013
Uh, well, s-see, that -- that's the thing.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.057
No, I get it. I do.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.769
Just from what she said

13:30.809 --> 13:33.354
Yeah, I was bad, um... Whatever, I was a --

13:33.396 --> 13:35.774
I was a bad third. I moved way too fast

13:35.814 --> 13:37.609
and I scared the shit out of you guys.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.235
So now you're retreating

13:39.277 --> 13:41.112
and you're trying to reinstate the ground rules

13:41.154 --> 13:43.364
and probably make it into a four-week

13:43.406 --> 13:44.865
uh, business arrangement again.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.286
Is that

13:48.328 --> 13:50.705
Um, in the general zip code, yeah.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.958
Damn. It's a gift.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.878
I brought some things.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.506
Just hear me out.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.343
You know what? Just...

14:05.595 --> 14:08.556
Wow. You're like Mary Poppins' way cooler granddaughter.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.725
We're gonna do something other than sex.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.851
We're gonna hang out together, but we're gonna do it here

14:12.893 --> 14:14.604
and not in the daylight, where you could face

14:14.646 --> 14:16.481
the scorn of your peers or lose your boring jobs.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.149
Uh, we built some serious momentum

14:18.191 --> 14:19.693
going in the other direction.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.031
Okay, so, uh, after tonight,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.033
if you still feel that way, then I will leave,

14:27.074 --> 14:29.243
and you will never see me again.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.329
But I'm not gonna take your money.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.206
It's all or nothing.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.627
Well...

14:37.669 --> 14:39.546
she's here.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.422
Right, before we do any of this,

14:41.464 --> 14:44.008
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.719
Nope.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.555
Tonight, we are going to fuck pages, fuck boundaries,

14:48.596 --> 14:50.598
fuck parameters, fuck all of it.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.099
We're just gonna fuck our fear.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.434
Fuck our fear? Yeah.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.645
We ready? Yeah.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.104
We're gonna start here.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.944
This is a very, very good pizza.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.739
Not your Hawthorne Heights shit.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.574
So I'm gonna need you to warm this

15:07.615 --> 15:11.285
to precisely 172 degrees Fahrenheit.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.953
It's part of the plan?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.997
Yes. Yes. And after that,

15:15.039 --> 15:16.875
I'm gonna need both of you to get into pajamas.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.543
Nothing sexy. No lingerie, Jack.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.837
Just PJs, okay?

15:20.879 --> 15:23.715
Okay. I guess you're the boss.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.551
Good. I'm glad we finally realized that.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.636
Heads up.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.847
And I highly suggest that you split that,

15:30.889 --> 15:32.348
'cause it's very strong.
