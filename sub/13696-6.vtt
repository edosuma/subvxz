Oh, Paul. No.

-I had no choice.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:20.898 --> 00:26.112
In the last year we've failed
to reach the income targets
laid out in our business plan.

00:26.195 --> 00:28.322
I thought the bank was
going to give us more time.

00:29.323 --> 00:31.492
They haven't.

00:31.576 --> 00:33.870
So they've foreclosed
on the loan to the estate.

00:35.788 --> 00:38.958
Selling the house is the
obvious way of paying it off.

00:39.042 --> 00:42.045
-They've always been
supportive in the past.
-Not any more.

00:43.254 --> 00:46.674
They've lost confidence in us.

00:48.676 --> 00:50.428
Or rather, in me.

00:51.679 --> 00:52.805
So they've pulled the plug.

00:52.889 --> 00:55.099
This means we shall
have to move out.

00:55.183 --> 00:57.852
That's usually what happens
when one sells
one's home, Donald.

00:57.935 --> 00:59.062
But where shall I go?

00:59.145 --> 01:01.397
-We'll have to find new homes.
-New jobs.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.441
-New friends.
-Oh, heavens.

01:03.524 --> 01:05.818
I think we're all being
a wee bit gloomy here.

01:05.902 --> 01:07.820
That's a bit rich
coming from you, Golly.

01:07.904 --> 01:10.030
There must be
another way to sort this out.

01:10.114 --> 01:14.577
You're right, Golly.
I'm not really going
to sell the estate. I...

01:14.660 --> 01:17.080
I just need to
buy time while...

01:17.163 --> 01:19.290

another solution.

01:26.422 --> 01:28.883
Yes, let's all look
on the bright side.

01:28.966 --> 01:32.095
After all, we're hardly in
the worst-case scenario yet.

01:32.178 --> 01:33.720
What's that?

01:33.805 --> 01:37.475
We might not actually
be able to sell it.

01:37.558 --> 01:39.936

Oh, no, it's not your fault.

harder than you or given more.

married on Friday.

get too drunk tonight.

I'm at a crossroads, Hector.

Not only may I soon have
to find myself a new home...

10:44.022 --> 10:45.314
Wouldn't have been like that
in my day.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.025
But...

10:47.108 --> 10:49.402
-I no longer wish to live
on my own.
-You don't.

10:49.485 --> 10:54.032
You live with a house
full of distant relatives
and assorted hangers on.

10:54.115 --> 10:57.660
How would you feel
if I was with someone else?

10:57.744 --> 10:59.912
Depends. Who is the blaggard?

Well, once I thought
Golly and I...

11:03.041 --> 11:04.375
What?

11:04.459 --> 11:07.086
Oh, there you are.
You're looking well.

Golly's a sound man on a hill
or in the middle of a torrent,

of a filly of your breeding,
over my dead body.

about that.

that's all he has to his name.

-What about Kilwillie?
-Well, he asked me once,
but it was too soon.

11:23.978 --> 11:26.773
-I don't think
he'll try again.
-We'll see about that.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.336

Right, let's get started.

11:48.419 --> 11:52.924
Obviously you've all heard
the news, which has
serious implications,

11:53.007 --> 11:57.595
not just for
the MacDonald family, but
for everybody in this room.

11:57.679 --> 12:01.641
I'm glad Paul has found the
time in his very busy schedule

12:01.724 --> 12:04.727
to come and tell us
what is on his mind.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.896
-Laird.
-Thanks, Iona.

12:10.608 --> 12:13.069
There are two things
that can happen.

12:13.152 --> 12:16.698
First, the bond that's tied
my family to this glen
and its people

12:16.781 --> 12:19.033
for hundreds of years
will be broken,

12:19.117 --> 12:23.705
and a new owner will come in
and do with Glenbogle
what he or she wants.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.002
So, what's the other option?

12:31.462 --> 12:35.341
-You could buy it.
-Me? (LAUGHS) Are you crazy?

12:43.391 --> 12:44.684
All of you.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.729
Crofters, tenants,
all the people of Glenbogle.

12:48.771 --> 12:50.398
A community buy-out.

12:50.481 --> 12:53.943
You mean under the
new legislation we get
first refusal, right?

12:54.027 --> 12:57.530
Yes. Our family would
keep the house, the
fishing and stalking rights.

12:57.613 --> 13:01.534
You'd own your own crofts
and a large proportion of
the hills and grounds.

13:01.617 --> 13:03.578
That would cost a fortune.

13:03.661 --> 13:06.622
There's a fund set up by the
Scottish Parliament for
this kind of scheme.

13:06.706 --> 13:09.459
-So it would cost us nothing?
-I'm not saying that.

13:09.542 --> 13:13.129
The community would
have to raise a proportion
of the purchase price.

13:13.212 --> 13:14.964
Now we're getting to it.

13:15.048 --> 13:17.425
For heaven's sake, Andy,
don't be so negative.

13:17.508 --> 13:19.344
I'm just seeing
what's involved.

13:20.428 --> 13:21.971
Whether it could work.

13:22.055 --> 13:25.683
Of course it couldn't.
You're being offered
a pig in a poke.

13:25.767 --> 13:29.145
The MacDonald family want
you to solve their problem.

13:29.228 --> 13:32.690
Transfer their debt to you.

13:32.774 --> 13:35.234
Excuse me,
this is a private meeting.

13:35.318 --> 13:36.527
That's okay, Iona.

13:38.154 --> 13:40.990
Mr Finlay is interested
in buying the estate.

13:44.535 --> 13:48.831
Unlike Mr MacDonald,
I'm a Scot.

13:48.915 --> 13:53.252
A working man who
respects other working men.

13:53.336 --> 13:56.464
And when I acquire the estate
I'll prove it.

13:56.547 --> 13:58.049
What do you mean?

13:58.132 --> 14:00.093
When I become
Laird of Glenbogle,

14:00.176 --> 14:03.805
I'll give every crofter
his or her land and home

14:03.888 --> 14:07.725
free, gratis, for nothing.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.561
(MURMURING)

14:23.700 --> 14:26.077
What the hell
are you playing at?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.371
I'm not playing, Mr MacDonald.

14:28.454 --> 14:30.081
What you're offering these
people, you can't be serious.

14:30.164 --> 14:33.418
I've never been more
serious about anything
in my entire life.

14:33.501 --> 14:35.294
It doesn't make any kind of
financial sense.

14:35.378 --> 14:38.798
It's not about money,
Mr MacDonald.

14:38.881 --> 14:42.301
I want Glenbogle and I don't
mind how much I pay for it.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.221
It's going to happen.

14:45.304 --> 14:48.099
-You might as well
give in now.
-Never.

14:48.182 --> 14:50.101
I'll fight you all the way.

14:50.184 --> 14:53.187
This is my family history
we're talking about.

14:53.271 --> 14:56.858
Your family history is one
of shameful injustice and I'm
going to put an end to it.

14:56.941 --> 14:58.609
I think you need to apologise
for that remark.

14:58.693 --> 15:00.945
I'll apologise for nothing!

15:01.029 --> 15:03.031
Your family flushed
my life down the toilet

15:03.114 --> 15:04.824
when I was 17 years old.

15:06.701 --> 15:08.369
I was born here.

15:08.453 --> 15:12.582
I went to work in your
big house when I was 16.

15:12.665 --> 15:15.460
I had a lass there,
I was happy.

15:15.543 --> 15:17.712
Then your father
branded me a thief,

15:17.795 --> 15:19.505
dragged me through
a kangaroo court

15:19.589 --> 15:22.592
and threw me out for
something I never did.

15:22.675 --> 15:25.178
I've got no idea what
you're talking about,

15:25.261 --> 15:27.263
but from where I'm standing,

15:27.347 --> 15:28.681
you've done
all right for yourself.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.516
Have you ever been on the
deck of a trawler?

15:31.768 --> 15:33.436
The filth? The fear?

15:34.896 --> 15:37.857
That was my life
for 10 years.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.401
I had to fight and scrap
my way out of the mess

15:40.485 --> 15:42.320
your family put me in,
MacDonald.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.990
And for that...

15:46.074 --> 15:48.576
You'll pay with
everything you have.

16:09.305 --> 16:11.683
-How did it go?
-Not very well.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.726
Ah.

16:14.644 --> 16:15.978
He's determined to get us out.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.315
It looks as if
he might succeed.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.903
Well, we've been
in trouble before.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.031
This is different.

16:28.574 --> 16:29.826
What exactly are you saying?

16:33.413 --> 16:34.956
We should start making
plans for the future.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.418
DONALD: As a matter of fact,
I already have.

16:38.501 --> 16:40.920
My pal, Georgie Beaumont,
we were in the Buffs together,

16:41.004 --> 16:44.632
has offered me a
billet in his pad
in the south of France.

16:44.716 --> 16:46.968
Bit of a bore now he's
in his anecdotage,

16:47.051 --> 16:48.928
but needs must I suppose.

16:49.804 --> 16:51.514
You're leaving?

16:51.597 --> 16:54.058
Oh, my dear girl,
it looks as if we're all going
to be doing that.

16:54.142 --> 16:55.143
When?

16:55.977 --> 16:57.854
-This afternoon.
-What?

16:57.937 --> 16:59.564
I can't bear
drawn out farewells.

16:59.647 --> 17:01.858
If you're going
to do something then
get on and do it.

17:01.941 --> 17:05.486
-But Paul's still trying
to see the guy off.
-MOLLY: Same old story.

17:05.569 --> 17:07.405
When the ship starts
to go down,

17:07.488 --> 17:10.450
the small, brown furry things
are the first to look out
for themselves.

17:10.532 --> 17:15.371
Excuse me,
I have a valise to pack.

17:15.454 --> 17:19.000
Ewan, do you have such a thing
as a tube of superglue?

17:24.422 --> 17:27.090
-Molly? Molly!
-Hmm?

17:29.177 --> 17:31.637
Well, lass.

17:31.721 --> 17:34.307
Looks like finally it
might all be over.

17:36.476 --> 17:37.685
What are you going to do?

17:38.311 --> 17:39.645
(SIGHS)

17:39.729 --> 17:41.481
I really don't know.

17:41.564 --> 17:43.358
Molly, Molly, I've a...

17:43.441 --> 17:45.234
I've a proposition for you.

17:46.527 --> 17:47.612
Thanks to the MacDonalds,

17:47.694 --> 17:49.405
the cottage is mine, right?

17:50.698 --> 17:52.908
Well, I want you
to know that...

17:52.992 --> 17:55.203
There will always be
a home for you there.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.621
Thank you.
You're very kind.

17:58.998 --> 18:01.876
But... What exactly
do you mean?

18:01.959 --> 18:05.962
I know it's not much compared
with this place, but...

18:06.047 --> 18:08.840
There'll be space enough
once Jess and I moved out.

18:10.968 --> 18:15.056
Oh, I see, so you...

18:15.139 --> 18:17.975
No, no, no, we'd find
a place in the village.

18:19.519 --> 18:22.689
Golly, always thinking
of other people,

18:22.772 --> 18:24.899
but I really couldn't
turf you out of your own home.

18:30.655 --> 18:34.659
Oh, Golly really is the most
maddening man I have
ever encountered.

18:35.952 --> 18:38.621
-Molly?
-Oh, be quiet you.

18:38.705 --> 18:39.956
I'm sorry?

18:40.039 --> 18:42.834
Oh, Kilwillie.

18:42.917 --> 18:46.879
I just looked in because
I rather hoped I could
take you out for a treat.

18:46.963 --> 18:50.299
Oh, well,
that would be lovely...

18:50.383 --> 18:53.761
But do you think you could
unstick my fingers first?

18:54.554 --> 18:55.888
Oh!

18:57.515 --> 18:59.308
Oh, yes, I see.

19:29.505 --> 19:31.299
So dreadful.

19:31.382 --> 19:34.469
The end of the MacDonalds
of Glenbogle as we know them.

19:34.552 --> 19:36.804
-No need to rub it in.
-Hector.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.097
His fault, you mean?

19:38.181 --> 19:42.435
-Well, I suppose
it probably is.
-Turncoat.

19:42.518 --> 19:44.562
I'd help if I could but...

19:44.645 --> 19:47.648
We can do without your
money, thank you very much.

19:47.732 --> 19:53.321
Poor you, tossed out
into the street like
some addle-brained bag lady.

19:53.404 --> 19:55.615
Well, I hope it
won't come to that!

19:55.698 --> 19:58.034
I just wish there was
something I could do to help.

19:58.117 --> 20:01.746
There is, you clot,
staring you in your
moon-shaped features.

20:03.414 --> 20:06.000
-There!
-Ah, thank you, Kilwillie.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.088
You know, Molly, it's, erm,

20:10.171 --> 20:12.715
very hard for a chap like me
to talk about
my innermost feelings.

20:12.799 --> 20:14.384
HECTOR: Oh, here we go.

20:14.467 --> 20:17.178
I put it down to
one's horrendously
expensive education.

20:17.261 --> 20:18.680
Heavens above!

20:18.763 --> 20:21.474
Which chiefly consisted of
parsing ancient Greek,

20:21.557 --> 20:23.017
the absence of
lockable lavatories

20:23.101 --> 20:24.644
and a surfeit of spotted dick.

20:24.727 --> 20:26.396
For God's sake, man,
get on with it!

20:26.479 --> 20:27.772
Will you shut up
and clear off?

20:27.855 --> 20:29.023
No, not you, Kilwillie.

20:29.107 --> 20:30.858
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

20:30.942 --> 20:33.861
I'm sorry,
I'm just overwrought.

20:33.945 --> 20:35.947
(GROANING)

20:37.740 --> 20:39.909
I can't believe you're going.
Just like that.

20:39.992 --> 20:41.744
What do you want?
Marching bands?

20:41.828 --> 20:43.579
A fly past by the Red Arrows?

20:43.663 --> 20:45.373
I don't know.
A proper goodbye.

20:45.456 --> 20:46.958
How ghastly.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.751
Well...

20:51.337 --> 20:53.381
I'm sorry
you're leaving, Donald.

20:53.464 --> 20:55.174
-It's been good to know you.
-Enough.

20:55.258 --> 21:00.138
No more. Sentimentality is the
curse of the working classes.

21:00.221 --> 21:03.057
No, Don, the curse
of the working classes
is the upper classes.

21:04.017 --> 21:05.268
Burn rubber.

21:27.665 --> 21:29.584
It's like he didn't
care about any of us.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.797
He wanted me
to give you these.

21:38.801 --> 21:40.553
So, when Paul came back
from this meeting

21:40.636 --> 21:42.722
he was tremendously cast down.

21:42.805 --> 21:44.724
-Oh?
-Most unlike him.

21:44.807 --> 21:48.144
He's usually such
a positive person.

21:48.227 --> 21:51.606
-Yes.
-So, I don't know
what's going on.

21:52.774 --> 21:54.734
Perhaps a spaceship's
about to land

21:54.817 --> 21:58.237
-and little green men are
going to colonise Glenbogle.
-Possibly.

21:59.489 --> 22:00.990
What?

22:01.074 --> 22:02.992
Kilwillie, am I boring you?

22:03.076 --> 22:04.869
If I'd wanted a
one-way conversation

22:04.952 --> 22:06.954
I'd have stayed at home
and talked to Hector.

22:07.038 --> 22:11.084
Molly, I'm sorry. I'm a bit
distracted, but I'm waiting.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.336
For Godot? A solar eclipse?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.296
-The grim reaper.
-There he is!

22:16.798 --> 22:18.758
Yoo-hoo. This way.

22:19.342 --> 22:20.385
(LAUGHS)

22:20.468 --> 22:22.845
Kilwillie, are you quite well?

22:22.929 --> 22:26.933
Well, I am a bit
feverish and dry of mouth.

22:27.016 --> 22:30.812
Oh, Molly, I know
we've cantered around
this course before,

22:30.895 --> 22:33.189
but times have changed.

22:33.272 --> 22:35.566
I'm worried about your future
happiness and welfare

22:35.650 --> 22:39.070
and I remain exceedingly
fond of you.

22:39.153 --> 22:42.323
So, I have an important
proposition to put to you.

22:44.242 --> 22:45.410
Which is?

22:45.493 --> 22:47.620
Cast your eye to the heavens.

22:50.331 --> 22:51.958
"Marry me, Polly".

22:52.458 --> 22:54.085
What?

22:57.213 --> 22:58.673
Oh, damn.

22:59.882 --> 23:02.343
It was a very bad line.

23:02.427 --> 23:04.804
He was over the
Kyles of Bute at the time.

23:07.974 --> 23:10.309
I can't believe
he did this for me.

23:10.393 --> 23:12.937
Everything about Donald
was unbelievable, Ewan.

23:39.339 --> 23:41.924
Ask not for
whom the bell tolls.

23:43.343 --> 23:45.511
It tolls for me.

23:45.595 --> 23:47.972
(BELL RINGS)

23:48.056 --> 23:51.225
(HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE BY THE
SWINGING BLUE JEANS PLAYING)

24:22.965 --> 24:25.677
Weird to think this time
tomorrow we'll be
man and wife.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.220
Hello there.

24:27.303 --> 24:28.680
-Hi.
-Hi, Paul.

24:28.763 --> 24:31.015
How's your head, Malcolm?

24:31.099 --> 24:35.561
Listen, Paul.
Iona says I should say sorry
for last night.

24:35.645 --> 24:37.480
Made a bit of a numpty
of myself, apparently.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.774
Oh, don't worry.
No more than usual, Malcolm.

24:39.857 --> 24:42.068
(CHUCKLES)

24:42.151 --> 24:45.238
-So, all set for tomorrow?
-Apart from Uncle Jimmy.

24:47.281 --> 24:49.492
Did Iona not tell you?

24:49.575 --> 24:53.162
He's supposed to be
giving her away but he's
fallen and broken his hip.

24:53.246 --> 24:55.540
-Can't do it.
-Oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.626
I sometimes think
this wedding's jinxed.

25:00.086 --> 25:01.504
Hey, maybe Paul could do it.

25:03.089 --> 25:04.507
Malcolm, I said no.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.885
Why not? That's what would
have happened in the old days.

25:07.969 --> 25:10.096
Except the laird would
have probably had his way
with the bride first, eh?

25:12.640 --> 25:14.851
I don't think
it's a great idea, Malcolm.

25:14.934 --> 25:16.227
Why? What's the problem?

25:18.438 --> 25:19.897
Who else are we
gonna get to do it?

25:21.065 --> 25:22.316
Well, if you're really stuck.

25:24.110 --> 25:26.070
Thanks, Paul.
Rehearsal's at 7:00 p.m.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.576
What time is Finlay
meeting the crofters?

25:33.077 --> 25:35.788
At 8:00. Why? Are you going?

25:35.872 --> 25:37.290
Oh, I'm not finished just yet.

25:48.509 --> 25:49.927
Botheration.

25:59.312 --> 26:02.815
Put your trotter down, Ronnie,
vital documents to retrieve

26:02.899 --> 26:04.442
and the lady
won't wait forever.

26:52.115 --> 26:53.866
What is he up to?

26:53.950 --> 26:55.451
There's one way to find out.

27:23.855 --> 27:25.648
Cairo... Cairo?

27:25.732 --> 27:28.317
Terrible place.
Full of foreigners.

27:28.401 --> 27:31.070
At least that's
what my friend, Farouk,
used to tell me

27:31.154 --> 27:33.239
and he must have known,
he was the king of Egypt.

27:34.365 --> 27:38.161
Donald, you are a funny man.

27:38.244 --> 27:39.579
Tell me about Sadie.

27:40.496 --> 27:42.165
What's she done with her life?

27:42.248 --> 27:46.419
-I was a striptease artiste.
-Ah.

27:46.502 --> 27:49.797
So much more intriguing
a name than stripper,
don't you think?

27:49.881 --> 27:52.717
-Yes.
-It was so innocent then.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.388
The law said we had to
stand like statues
on the stage. Nothing moved.

27:57.972 --> 27:59.098
What, nothing?

27:59.724 --> 28:01.267
Well, not much.

28:07.648 --> 28:11.319
-Ah...
-Donald, are you all right?

28:11.402 --> 28:13.279
Well, it suddenly
got hot in here.

28:13.363 --> 28:16.115
I'll just go and
powder my nose, shall I?

28:23.748 --> 28:25.416
Donald, what are you doing?

28:25.500 --> 28:28.628
Before you start,
it's all for the best.

28:28.711 --> 28:31.422
Glenbogle is washed up

28:31.506 --> 28:35.051
and you're better off
without me. And here,
at least, I'm close to...

28:35.635 --> 28:37.387
My own kind.

28:37.470 --> 28:40.390
The senseless
and the insensible.

28:40.473 --> 28:44.018
So leave this great
Caledonian pine

28:44.102 --> 28:47.146
to shed his leaves
in the autumn of his days

28:49.232 --> 28:52.151
and slowly wither away.

28:53.069 --> 28:54.612
Pine trees don't shed leaves.

28:54.696 --> 28:57.073
Oh, buzz off,

28:57.156 --> 28:58.991
before the totty gets back.

29:01.703 --> 29:04.163
My friends...

29:04.247 --> 29:07.458
Never trust a man
who calls you his friend
when he doesn't know you.

29:08.376 --> 29:10.545
Have a drink on me.

29:10.628 --> 29:14.966
Unless the present owner
wants to put his hand
in his pocket for a change.

29:15.049 --> 29:18.845
The people here are
too sensible to be swayed
by a buckshee whisky.

29:20.596 --> 29:22.849
That's typical.

29:22.932 --> 29:26.394
It's not in
this man's interest for you
to work together with us

29:26.477 --> 29:30.023
for the common good,
so he's offering you
a big bribe instead.

29:30.106 --> 29:33.109
And, yes, he'll make you
richer as individuals,

29:33.192 --> 29:35.319
but you'll be poorer
as a community.

29:35.403 --> 29:39.073
Your family has done nothing
for the people of this glen.

29:39.157 --> 29:43.661
You've treated them shamefully
and your father was
the worst of the lot.

29:43.745 --> 29:47.707
PAUL: People will make
their own judgement
of my family, and my father,

29:47.790 --> 29:51.169
based on what they know,
not what you tell them.

29:55.631 --> 29:57.091
You all know me here.

29:58.885 --> 30:00.553
I love this place.

30:01.637 --> 30:03.806
It's my home.

30:03.890 --> 30:05.350
The only real home
I've ever had.

30:06.893 --> 30:08.478
And I've got so much more
to give to it.

30:11.439 --> 30:13.024
So, let me know
tomorrow what you decide.

30:19.530 --> 30:21.115
Peter Finlay.

30:23.910 --> 30:26.037
What did he mean,
that crack about Hector?

30:27.955 --> 30:29.457
I don't know, Molly.

30:29.540 --> 30:31.209
Then I'll go
and ask him myself.

30:37.131 --> 30:39.801
-Hector MacDonald!
-Hello, Molly, old girl.

30:39.884 --> 30:42.970
Show yourself.
I want to see you.

30:43.054 --> 30:46.599
-Oh. That's nice, old darling.
-You foolish, foolish man!

30:51.854 --> 30:53.690
What's the matter?
You seem upset.

30:53.773 --> 30:56.234
-It's all your fault.
-Why?

30:56.317 --> 30:57.485
What have I done now?

31:00.363 --> 31:03.157
I could kill you.
It's a good job
you're already dead.

31:08.037 --> 31:11.708
It's over, Hector. The end of
the MacDonalds of Glenbogle.

31:11.791 --> 31:14.127
This isn't our home any more.

31:14.210 --> 31:17.588
-I shall have to leave
and so will you.
-Oh, dear.

31:17.672 --> 31:20.008
The family's
breaking up for good

31:20.091 --> 31:23.386
and you are
the person responsible.
Do you understand?

31:23.469 --> 31:26.556
-No, I don't, but that's
par for the course.
-It's terrible for everyone.

31:28.599 --> 31:30.309
I don't want
to see you any more.

31:32.186 --> 31:35.481
Oh... Well,

31:35.565 --> 31:39.444
if that's what
you wish. Cheerio.

31:48.327 --> 31:50.079
I said leave me alone.

31:50.788 --> 31:51.998
Molly?

31:54.208 --> 31:56.210
I just want to say,

31:57.253 --> 32:00.548
don't blame Hector for this.

32:00.631 --> 32:03.176
-It's not his fault.
-I don't want to
hear any more.

32:06.346 --> 32:07.638
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:07.722 --> 32:09.932
Kilwillie's asked me
to marry him.

32:10.016 --> 32:11.309
What do you think about that?

32:12.435 --> 32:13.603
He's a lucky man.

32:14.729 --> 32:16.064
Is that all?

32:16.147 --> 32:17.815
He'll give you the
life you deserve, Molly.

32:21.402 --> 32:22.820
Good night, lass.

32:39.295 --> 32:43.549
Look, if this is
such a big deal,
why don't we just spring him?

32:43.633 --> 32:44.967
How do you mean?

32:45.051 --> 32:47.095
Get him out. Bring him home.

32:48.805 --> 32:49.931
You're some girl,
you know that?

32:52.725 --> 32:55.353
Molly didn't make such a
bad job of you, Hector.

32:59.232 --> 33:03.111
Well, the day has come.

33:05.863 --> 33:07.740
I always knew
it had to be faced.

33:16.332 --> 33:18.418
I'm just sorry
you won't be around

33:19.335 --> 33:21.587
to hear what I have to say.

33:21.671 --> 33:23.006
HECTOR: Carry on, Golly.
I'll be listening.

33:31.472 --> 33:33.057
(GRUNTS)

33:37.812 --> 33:44.402
And there's me and my brother
Hector in our very own
little pony and trap.

33:44.485 --> 33:47.822
We drove all over
the country in it.

33:47.905 --> 33:50.908
And did the peasants
all doff their caps to you
as you went by?

33:51.826 --> 33:54.495
They still do.

33:54.579 --> 33:57.123
Not that I actually have a
vehicle of my own any more.

33:57.874 --> 33:59.792
Good job I do, then.

33:59.876 --> 34:02.295
I thought we might go for
a bite of lunch somewhere.

34:02.378 --> 34:03.963
Mmm.

34:04.047 --> 34:06.841
That's a splendid idea.

34:06.924 --> 34:09.969
Yes... I'll just go
and put my face on.

34:15.516 --> 34:17.310
Do you know,

34:17.393 --> 34:19.312
I think I'm going to
be very happy here.

34:32.158 --> 34:35.328
(GROANS) Ow! Ooh!

34:35.411 --> 34:38.706
What's happening?
What's going on?

34:41.668 --> 34:44.920
(MUFFLED CRIES)

34:53.262 --> 34:54.806
Boss.

35:02.271 --> 35:03.523
What's he doing here?

35:04.982 --> 35:06.859
I asked him to come.

35:06.943 --> 35:08.528
-What?
-Trust me.

35:25.545 --> 35:28.840
-It's Donald of Arabia!
-What happened? Where am I?

35:34.137 --> 35:40.393
What a great privilege it is
to dedicate this fine memorial
to an even finer man.

35:42.395 --> 35:45.188
Friends, we are meeting
here today to...

35:45.273 --> 35:47.483
Forgive me, Fiona.

35:47.567 --> 35:48.943
I just want
to say a few words.

35:51.403 --> 35:52.613
Mainly to this man here.

35:55.825 --> 36:00.204
Peter Finlay, you've been
gone from this place
for nigh on 40 years.

36:02.248 --> 36:05.335
And I've seen your face in
my dreams countless times.

36:07.586 --> 36:09.047
You suffered
a terrible wrong here.

36:10.423 --> 36:11.549
You were no thief.

36:13.217 --> 36:15.345
I know that for the simple
reason that I was.

36:17.221 --> 36:18.681
-Dad?
-I know.

36:19.849 --> 36:22.018
I know.

36:22.101 --> 36:24.687
Good old Golly, the faithful
servant, the upright man.

36:26.564 --> 36:27.982
Well...

36:30.026 --> 36:31.402
I'm afraid it's true.

36:32.278 --> 36:33.696
My ring.

36:33.780 --> 36:35.114
I stole this ring.

36:37.033 --> 36:38.409
I robbed my laird...

36:40.453 --> 36:42.246
And then let another man
suffer for my crime.

36:46.209 --> 36:47.543
Molly...

36:49.212 --> 36:51.798
Molly.

36:51.881 --> 36:54.759
The moment you came
to Glenbogle
I was daft about you.

36:56.511 --> 36:57.804
Never felt that way before.

36:59.972 --> 37:01.766
But...

37:01.849 --> 37:03.059
You were out of my reach.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.729
And you had Hector,

37:06.813 --> 37:08.147
the love of your life.

37:11.401 --> 37:13.152
But I had to
have something of you.

37:14.987 --> 37:16.656
A token of you,
of what I felt for you.

37:17.615 --> 37:18.825
Golly.

37:19.617 --> 37:20.910
So I took this.

37:23.287 --> 37:26.749
Then I stood by and watched
Hector convict
young Finlay here.

37:30.086 --> 37:32.714
You were in Molly's bedroom
that day, fixing her radiator.

37:34.966 --> 37:36.718
Wrong place, wrong time.

37:36.801 --> 37:38.720
-You?
-I was young.

37:40.722 --> 37:43.057
Very young, very foolish.

37:44.559 --> 37:46.102
I'm making no excuses.

37:48.771 --> 37:52.358
If it's any consolation
I have been punished for it.

37:54.193 --> 37:58.489
I've never known happiness,
lasting happiness,

37:59.574 --> 38:00.950
with any woman.

38:03.036 --> 38:04.037
Well...

38:05.496 --> 38:06.998
I brought that on myself.

38:07.957 --> 38:10.793
Please, take that back.

38:12.170 --> 38:13.421
I'm sorry.

38:16.883 --> 38:18.259
I'm sorry, Peter.

38:23.014 --> 38:26.309
Um... Fiona.

38:28.770 --> 38:33.691
Time to give thanks
for the memory of
Hector Naismith MacDonald.

38:45.370 --> 38:46.621
Come on.

38:49.374 --> 38:51.876
It's kind of you to consider
my welfare but the thing is...

38:53.169 --> 38:54.629
How do I express this?

38:54.712 --> 38:58.091
It's turned out to be more
agreeable than I anticipated.

38:58.174 --> 39:01.803
-What? You like it better?
-Well, people of my
own age and interests.

39:01.886 --> 39:03.888
You mean you like them better?

39:03.971 --> 39:07.266
They can offer me things
that you and others can't.

39:07.350 --> 39:08.851
But we're your mates,
aren't we?

39:08.935 --> 39:11.312
Donald, wake up
and smell the coffee.

39:11.396 --> 39:14.190
This isn't about your
feelings. It's about Ewan's.

39:14.273 --> 39:15.400
He misses you.

39:16.317 --> 39:18.194
Nah.

39:18.277 --> 39:20.446
Ewan, misses little old me?
Well...

39:21.155 --> 39:23.491
Foolish boy.

39:23.574 --> 39:25.326
What am I going
to do with you, eh?

39:26.494 --> 39:27.912
I can hardly come back.

39:29.414 --> 39:30.873
You might be leaving next.

39:36.462 --> 39:38.131
This changes nothing.

39:38.214 --> 39:39.465
You must know that.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.263
Paul.

39:45.346 --> 39:49.892
We've had a meeting and
we've come to a decision.

39:49.976 --> 39:53.396
There was only ever
going to be one result.

39:53.479 --> 39:56.274
We'd like to open discussions
with the MacDonald family

39:56.357 --> 39:59.444
about a community buy-out
of the estate.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.904
You're making
a foolish mistake.

40:01.988 --> 40:04.574
The MacDonalds have
always looked after us.

40:05.867 --> 40:08.911
Maybe it's time we
did the same for you.

40:08.995 --> 40:12.540
We'd like you to
help us run the new Glenbogle
in the future.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.209
I'm not quite finished yet.

40:19.964 --> 40:21.090
That's great news.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.594
Great news, for all of us.

40:25.845 --> 40:27.013
Thank you.

40:28.848 --> 40:30.433
-Thank you.
-Don't thank us.

40:31.601 --> 40:32.852
Thank Iona.

40:37.857 --> 40:39.317
Do you love me, Golly?

40:41.194 --> 40:43.446
I've loved you for as
long as I can remember.

40:44.989 --> 40:46.741
Nothing's changed.

40:46.824 --> 40:49.827
You are a brave
and beautiful man.

40:49.911 --> 40:52.580
-No, I'm not.
-You are.
You've just proved it.

40:52.663 --> 40:54.791
I'm not worthy of you.

40:54.874 --> 40:57.085
(SCOFFS)
Let me be the judge of that.

40:57.168 --> 40:58.670
I can offer you nothing.

41:02.590 --> 41:05.093
I would rather be poor
with the man I love,

41:05.176 --> 41:06.469
than rich with
someone I don't.

41:10.682 --> 41:12.350
The cause of so much trouble.

41:16.813 --> 41:17.897
Give me your hand.

41:24.278 --> 41:25.697
I never really liked it...

41:26.906 --> 41:27.990
Until now.

41:29.992 --> 41:31.327
Molly MacDonald...

41:33.496 --> 41:34.747
You're a marvel.

41:43.548 --> 41:44.841
A marvel.

42:06.779 --> 42:09.073
Are you all right?

42:09.157 --> 42:10.783
I can't thank you enough
for what you did today.

42:12.243 --> 42:13.870
Just call it my parting gift.

42:43.566 --> 42:44.984
Molly?

42:46.903 --> 42:48.529
You've decided, haven't you?

42:50.656 --> 42:51.949
Dear Kilwillie.

42:53.868 --> 42:56.371
I do love you...

42:56.996 --> 42:58.122
Ah.

42:58.206 --> 43:01.084
-As a friend.
-Ah.

43:03.795 --> 43:04.962
Is it Golly?

43:07.465 --> 43:09.133
Always the bridesmaid.

43:09.217 --> 43:10.259
(LAUGHS)

43:12.095 --> 43:14.847
Oh, Golly...

43:14.931 --> 43:17.183
Well, let me shake your hand.

43:19.602 --> 43:22.438
(EMOTIONALLY) I wish you
both very great joy.

43:25.858 --> 43:27.276
-Oh!
-Okay?

43:28.611 --> 43:29.946
Yeah, I'm...

43:30.029 --> 43:31.739
So nervous, I think
I'm going to be sick.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.991
You look beautiful.

43:35.451 --> 43:36.786
That doesn't help.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.171
Happiest day of your life, eh?

44:07.400 --> 44:09.110
Well, at least he turned up
this time.

44:42.685 --> 44:44.937
We are here today
to consecrate the marriage

44:45.021 --> 44:48.399
of Malcolm McRae
and Iona McLean,

44:48.483 --> 44:50.026
and what a happy day it is.

44:53.321 --> 44:55.823
Who is it who gives this
woman to this man?

44:56.741 --> 44:57.742
I do.

44:59.035 --> 45:00.453
And it's the hardest
thing I've ever done.

45:06.125 --> 45:10.838
If there is anyone who has
any just impediment why this
marriage cannot take place?

45:12.382 --> 45:13.883
Sorry, Fiona,
could you just...

45:15.009 --> 45:16.302
Could you hold on a minute?

45:17.220 --> 45:18.221
What did you mean by that?

45:21.683 --> 45:23.142
Just slipped out, I suppose.

45:24.727 --> 45:25.978
Couldn't quite
keep a lid on it.

45:27.897 --> 45:29.065
On what?

45:33.111 --> 45:34.320
That I love you.

45:36.447 --> 45:38.616
Hang on, that's not right.
You can't stand here
in the church

45:38.700 --> 45:40.326
saying I love you to
another man's wife.

45:41.994 --> 45:43.037
She isn't.

Not yet.

You take that back right now.

45:48.084 --> 45:50.378
-Malcolm...
-I can't.

45:50.461 --> 45:52.422
Fine then, I'll make you.

45:52.505 --> 45:53.631
Malcolm, don't. Calm down.

45:53.715 --> 45:55.633
If anybody's gonna hit
him then I will!

45:57.260 --> 45:58.928
What did you say that for?

45:59.762 --> 46:01.014
It came from the heart.

46:05.309 --> 46:06.978
Go after her, Paul.

46:07.061 --> 46:08.688
Perhaps someone ought to.

46:19.282 --> 46:20.783
BOTH: Iona.

46:21.617 --> 46:22.952
One at a time.

46:24.996 --> 46:26.247
You first.

46:31.127 --> 46:32.628
Let's be honest, Malcolm.

46:34.047 --> 46:37.383
You only proposed to
me this time because...

46:37.467 --> 46:39.927
Because you felt guilty
about what happened
the last time.

46:41.596 --> 46:45.475
You don't want to settle down
with me, here, now.

46:47.477 --> 46:48.478
Do you?

46:54.400 --> 46:55.902
You know me better
than I know myself.

47:02.533 --> 47:03.743
Goodbye.

47:17.924 --> 47:19.550
Iona.

47:19.634 --> 47:21.135
Don't you dare speak to me.

47:23.930 --> 47:25.306
You just gave me away.

47:27.642 --> 47:29.268
And now
I'm taking repossession.

Do you still perform at all?

47:59.048 --> 48:01.718
No, but I still
have all my props.

48:03.302 --> 48:07.390
-Well, tassels don't
take up much space.
-No.

for that matter.

to grow old disgracefully,
just like Donald.

48:15.356 --> 48:16.816
Why wait that long?

48:16.899 --> 48:18.609
We can grow up
disgracefully instead.

48:23.531 --> 48:25.783
How do you feel about
the ordination of women?

48:25.867 --> 48:27.827
Oh, I'm tremendously for it.

48:27.910 --> 48:30.705
But, then, I've always had
a bit of a thing about
women in uniform.

48:35.168 --> 48:37.170
IONA:
It's been quite an eventful
morning in the church,

48:37.253 --> 48:38.504
one way or another.

48:38.588 --> 48:41.215
Certainly was. It'll be
talked about for years.

48:42.759 --> 48:45.511
I've always wanted to
create a family legend.

48:45.595 --> 48:48.389
Oh, well, I've always wanted
to just create a family.

48:53.394 --> 48:54.854
MOLLY: Where shall we live?

48:54.937 --> 48:57.065
Your place or mine?

48:57.148 --> 48:59.067
What do you think Hector
would say?

48:59.150 --> 49:00.860
You, me and the baby.

49:00.943 --> 49:03.071
I'll ask him if you like.

49:03.154 --> 49:04.572
I'll just get
some more champagne.

49:12.372 --> 49:13.456
DUNCAN: I'm back!

49:14.290 --> 49:16.084
(ALL CHEER)

49:17.794 --> 49:19.379
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

49:20.296 --> 49:21.297
But I...

49:24.300 --> 49:26.886
(ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD)

49:33.935 --> 49:35.311
(CLICK OF BILLIARDS)

49:50.743 --> 49:53.162
Hello, Molly. Having a party?

49:53.246 --> 49:56.082
-Things to celebrate.
-So I gathered.

49:56.165 --> 49:58.251
You don't mind, about Golly?

49:58.334 --> 49:59.544
Whatever makes you happy,
my love.

50:02.088 --> 50:03.881
This won't do, Hector.

50:03.965 --> 50:05.258
The estate's secure.

50:05.341 --> 50:07.135
Everybody's happy. Even me.

50:08.011 --> 50:10.263
Time to push off, eh?

50:11.305 --> 50:13.224
To say goodbye, my darling.

50:13.307 --> 50:15.893
I'll just finish
this last frame.

50:15.977 --> 50:18.980
By the way, Molly, have
you seen my silver quaich?

50:19.063 --> 50:24.402
Regimental golf competition,
runner up, Gleneagles 1958,
used to sit there.

50:24.485 --> 50:26.446
Well, you know what
this house is like.

50:30.116 --> 50:31.993
(HELICOPTER WHIRS)

50:38.207 --> 50:39.334
(HECTOR GROANS)

50:51.721 --> 50:53.056
Well played.

51:13.785 --> 51:17.330
-I've just got to check.
-Just leave it! It'll be fine.

51:17.413 --> 51:19.332
Come on, back into the party.

51:19.415 --> 51:22.293
-Come on, just leave it.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

51:50.863 --> 51:52.073
(BABY CRIES)

51:53.449 --> 51:55.451
Shh... Come on...

51:58.788 --> 52:00.081
Shh...

52:38.494 --> 52:40.455
(CHEERING AND
LAUGHTER OUTSIDE)

52:57.472 --> 52:58.973
Which is the happy couple?

52:59.057 --> 53:00.391
We're the happy couple.

53:01.392 --> 53:03.102
I'm the happy couple.

53:03.186 --> 53:04.228
We're the happy couple.

53:06.481 --> 53:08.274
A toast! A toast!

53:09.567 --> 53:10.860
To Glenbogle.

53:10.943 --> 53:12.445
ALL: Glenbogle!
