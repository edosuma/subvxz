WEBVTT

00:08.467 --> 00:11.049
The unparalleled battle between Vegeta,

00:11.261 --> 00:13.468
who had reverted to being a warrior of evil,

00:13.681 --> 00:16.343
and Son Goku continued.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.766
Further, having received their damage energy,

00:19.978 --> 00:22.310
the sphere containing Majin Boo was...

00:22.523 --> 00:26.232
Majin Boo has reached his full power!

00:26.443 --> 00:29.480
He's reached full power!

00:32.323 --> 00:36.158
At last, Majin Boo will be revived!

00:38.956 --> 00:43.416
H-How can this be?! How can the
worst-case scenario come true?!

00:43.627 --> 00:45.993
I completely misjudged this!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.329
At last, the seal is released.

00:48.549 --> 00:54.510
Will the terrible monster
Majin Boo reveal himself at last?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

"The Seal is Released?!
Gohan's Kamehame-Ha of Resistance."

02:48.836 --> 02:50.827
What are you doing, Goten?!

02:54.132 --> 02:55.918
--Yeah, but...
--What?

02:56.134 --> 02:59.262
l have to go pee!

02:59.471 --> 03:02.679
Go pee? Just hold it in!

03:02.891 --> 03:06.429
I can't! I haven't gone at all
since the tournament started!

03:06.645 --> 03:07.885
It's going to come out!

03:08.105 --> 03:10.391
Sheesh, what am I going to do with you?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.277
All right, over there!

03:14.486 --> 03:15.726
Go over there and do it!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.857
--Hurry!
--Uh-huh!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.914
Oh, Trunks-kun!

03:33.130 --> 03:35.121
Hee-hee, me too!

03:37.134 --> 03:39.125
Mine's going farther than yours!

03:39.344 --> 03:40.459
Now mine is!

03:40.679 --> 03:44.388
--Whee! Yeah!
--Go! Go, go!

03:44.600 --> 03:47.467
--Yay! Yay!
--Go! Go!

03:52.190 --> 03:54.021
Hey, hold on!

03:58.780 --> 03:59.815
Wow, he startled me!

04:00.032 --> 04:02.489
We have to hurry! Let's rip, Goten!

04:02.701 --> 04:04.191
Uh-huh!

04:11.209 --> 04:12.870
Up yours!

04:27.100 --> 04:28.965
What's the matter, Kakarrot?!

04:38.737 --> 04:40.648
Over there!

04:40.864 --> 04:43.856
Die, Kakarrot!

04:44.076 --> 04:46.112
Not bad, Vegeta.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.243
This is getting my fire going, too.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.842
Hey, for some reason, I'm sensing
a crazy, out-of-this-world Ki!

05:04.054 --> 05:06.010
Who could it be? Our papas?

05:06.223 --> 05:10.341
|-| don't know, but a little while ago,
it was coming from the tournament, too.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.052
Why are we sensing such amazing Ki
bouncing all over the place?

05:14.272 --> 05:17.400
You think maybe there are fights
breaking out all over the world?

05:17.609 --> 05:21.193
I don't have the faintest idea what's going on.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.236
Should we give up on
heading there and go back?

05:23.448 --> 05:27.191
No way, no way! I want to see
Majin Boo! No matter what!

05:27.411 --> 05:29.242
Y-You got it, Goten!

05:29.454 --> 05:32.662
All right, let's head toward the
largest Ki and see what's there.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.375
Uh-huh!

05:50.726 --> 05:52.808
It's been a long time
since I've been so worked up!

05:53.020 --> 05:55.682
No matter what happens,
I ain't gonna be beaten by you!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.247
Back at you!

06:32.642 --> 06:34.382
Nicely fended off, Kakarrot!

06:34.603 --> 06:36.844
You're just wasting your limited power!

06:37.064 --> 06:38.804
Oh, we're just getting started!

06:48.784 --> 06:50.820
Unbelievable...

06:51.036 --> 06:54.369
I thought I had trained
quite a bit in the Next World,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.742
but we're absolutely evenly matched.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.200
You must have trained
even harder than I did, huh?

07:00.420 --> 07:04.834
No! Sure, I think I put in more
special training than you did,

07:05.050 --> 07:07.666
but your talents have taken you
even higher than me.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.719
Even after all this time,
that gap remains unchanged!

07:10.931 --> 07:12.216
I could tell.

07:12.432 --> 07:17.392
When you fought that monster
that Babidi sent you...

07:30.867 --> 07:32.482
It was a shock!

07:32.702 --> 07:34.567
How could I, the gifted prince of carnage,

07:34.788 --> 07:39.031
be forever outpaced by a
lower-level warrior such as yourself?!

07:39.251 --> 07:42.209
That's why I secretly made my resolve!

07:43.547 --> 07:46.960
Oh! You mean Babidi!

07:47.175 --> 07:49.632
That's why you intentionally
submitted to Babidi's spell.

07:49.845 --> 07:54.555
Yeah. That's when I remembered
the two at the tournament

07:54.766 --> 07:58.008
who had been made into Babidi's flunkies.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.272
He's completely unlike he was before!

08:08.488 --> 08:10.479
He's so strong, it's like he's a different person!

08:12.492 --> 08:15.780
Those who had known those men previously

08:15.996 --> 08:18.908
said that they were
much stronger than before.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.786
When I remembered that, I had a thought--

08:22.002 --> 08:23.708
if I was under his control, too,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.788
then, Kakarrot, the gap between us
just might disappear!

08:29.843 --> 08:32.505
It turns out l was right.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.174
I don't much care for the means, though.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.634
Vegeta, as much pride as you have,
you let yourself be controlled by that guy

08:40.854 --> 08:43.265
just because you wanted to get stronger?

08:43.481 --> 08:47.394
|-| wanted...

08:47.611 --> 08:52.731
I wanted... to go back to who I was before!

08:52.949 --> 08:56.316
I wanted to go back to being
the savage, cold-blooded Saiyan l was,

08:56.536 --> 09:01.030
not caring about anything
except wanting to fight you all-out!

09:01.249 --> 09:03.080
I wasn't happy.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.330
Not with how, before I'd known it,
I'd been influenced by all of you

09:06.546 --> 09:09.083
and let myself become so peaceful.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.791
Th-That l, of all people, had a family...

09:14.179 --> 09:17.671
...a-and that it didn't seem all that bad...

09:17.891 --> 09:22.305
I started to like how comfortable
it was living on Earth, too!

09:24.022 --> 09:26.684
Th-That's why I needed to let
myself be controlled by Babidi,

09:26.900 --> 09:30.188
and go back to the villain l was before!

09:34.157 --> 09:37.274
And as a result, I feel great right now.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.570
Is that really true, Vegeta?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.891
It is almost time, Babidi-sama.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.562
Majin Boo's seal is being released!

10:09.526 --> 10:13.439
He's coming out! Majin Boo is coming out!

10:45.937 --> 10:48.599
W-What is this? What's happening?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.316
I don't know...

10:51.901 --> 10:55.814
Mister Satan, please call out
to everyone to remain calm.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.646
But...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.114
If you don't, we'll have a panic,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.443
and things will get out of control.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.575
We also haven't given you your
prize money yet, Mister Satan.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.782
Ah, the prize money!

11:09.002 --> 11:12.335
You're right! I haven't gotten
my prize money yet, huh?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.663
H-Hurry up and give it to me.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.670
|-| couldn't! Not under these circumstances!

11:17.886 --> 11:20.172
Ladies and gentlemen! Do not panic!

11:20.388 --> 11:23.221
You have Mister Satan with you
at all times, do you not?!

11:23.433 --> 11:26.095
Even if the end of the world were upon us,

11:26.311 --> 11:30.520
as long as |, Mister Satan,
am among you, I will protect you!

11:30.732 --> 11:33.098
|t's Mister Satan!

11:33.318 --> 11:36.606
Yeah! We still have Mister Satan!

11:36.821 --> 11:39.312
Mister Satan! We're relying on you!

11:39.532 --> 11:46.904
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!...

11:53.421 --> 11:56.754
| nailed it! | nailed it cool!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.548
Now to get my prize money and go home, fast!

12:01.805 --> 12:04.342
Hmm... Something is happening.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.766
Something terrible, unlike anything
we've been through before.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.516
O-Oh, no. Goten-chan has gone off somewhere,

12:12.732 --> 12:15.144
while no sooner do Gohan
and Goku-sa show up

12:15.360 --> 12:19.399
than they go disappearin' again.
What am I supposed to do?!

12:41.636 --> 12:43.501
Trunks-kun! Stop! Stop!

12:43.721 --> 12:45.222
Huh? What is it, Goten?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.390
Something's been weird
for the last little while.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.762
There's a big Ki coming from that way, too.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.847
Mm-hmm, I know. A strange Ki,
like nothing I've ever felt before.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.055
It's pretty big, too.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.231
Uh-huh.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.150
Both this way, and that way.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.525
Ah! Things are starting to
get even more complicated!

13:12.250 --> 13:13.410
Th-Those birds...

13:13.626 --> 13:15.787
I wonder what's upsetting so many of them.

13:16.004 --> 13:20.213
What in the world is going on?
Does it have to do with Majin Boo?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.915
Beats me.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.226
Dabra, he's finally coming out!
Majin Boo is coming out!

14:22.445 --> 14:23.776
Y-Yes, sir.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.195
At last, the seal has been released.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.399
F-Finally, we're going to get to see Majin Boo!

14:29.619 --> 14:31.280
Okay, come on out!

14:31.496 --> 14:36.160
Just how incredible is this
Majin Boo that my papa created?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.788
I cannot wait to see, Babidi-sama.

14:39.003 --> 14:44.248
I've been waiting so long for this day!
Hurry up and come out!

14:46.302 --> 14:48.793
Father's damage energy...

14:49.013 --> 14:53.131
Father's beyond-Super-Saiyan
damage energy...

14:53.351 --> 14:57.344
...has revived Majin Boo as quickly as this...!

14:57.564 --> 15:01.432
It is hopeless now!
Let's get out of here, Gohan-san!

15:01.651 --> 15:04.518
Let's get out of here, Gohan-san!

15:04.737 --> 15:07.695
What good will it do, saying things like that?!

15:07.907 --> 15:09.863
We can't just leave things the way they are!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.692
If we do that, then Majin Boo will be revived!

15:12.912 --> 15:16.075
Listen to me! There is absolutely
no way that we can beat Majin Boo!

15:16.291 --> 15:18.452
There is no one who can defeat him--

15:18.668 --> 15:23.207
not you people, or anyone else!
If we remain here, without any doubt,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.539
we will be killed!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.840
But Kaioshin-sama...!

15:28.052 --> 15:30.714
Quickly, Gohan-san! Let's get out of here!

15:30.930 --> 15:31.965
Kaioshin-sama!

15:35.226 --> 15:39.435
If he's already reached full
power anyway, then at least...

15:54.621 --> 15:56.407
W-What are you...?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.288
W-What is he planning to do?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.214
I don't know.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.009
...I can resist him this much!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.374
Gohan-san!

17:09.779 --> 17:15.900
Why, that rotten...! Babidi-sama,
I shall go and pacify him.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.858
l-lt's all right.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.742
It will take more than that to
make Majin Boo even flinch.

17:25.420 --> 17:31.040
Y-You fool! That won't do you any good!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.270
All right...!

18:15.344 --> 18:19.838
Oh! There he is! It's Majin Boo!

18:20.057 --> 18:21.558
Babidi-sama!

18:30.610 --> 18:32.100
lt's...

18:33.279 --> 18:35.144
|t's empty...

18:43.039 --> 18:47.829
N-No... That can't be right...

18:48.044 --> 18:52.333
It can't be... Why? Why is this?

18:57.220 --> 19:03.011
Come on out! Come on out, I say,
Majin Boo! Please come on out!

19:08.731 --> 19:10.767
What great fortune!

19:12.735 --> 19:15.818
Too bad for you, Babidi!

19:16.030 --> 19:19.864
Majin Boo was eliminated
by that attack just now.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.192
He probably shriveled up
during his long slumber,

19:22.411 --> 19:25.198
so no matter how much energy
you pumped into him,

19:25.414 --> 19:28.577
he was no longer as tough as he once was.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.910
Now, the Earth is saved!

19:34.215 --> 19:37.082
It is still all right, is it not, Babidi-sama?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.714
Even without Majin Boo, I am still here.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.422
Not to mention that Vegeta fellow
being under your control, as well,

19:44.642 --> 19:46.598
albeit not quite entirely.

19:46.811 --> 19:51.601
B-But Majin Boo is...
The Majin Boo that my papa created is...

19:51.816 --> 19:55.104
Babidi! Are you blubbering now,
at this stage of the game?

19:57.822 --> 20:02.816
Dabra, at this point, let's take care
of that smart-alecky Kaioshin, at least!

20:03.035 --> 20:04.536
Yes, sir!

20:06.622 --> 20:10.285
I will bring Babidi into submission.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.334
Then, Gohan-san, once you defeat Dabra,

20:13.546 --> 20:17.255
Babidi's plans will be completely done for!

20:17.466 --> 20:21.300
Come! Now is the time for you to
become angry, as Goku-san said!

20:21.512 --> 20:25.801
Please become angry,
and show us your true power!

20:26.017 --> 20:29.635
Gohan-san! Peace is just
around the corner now!

20:29.854 --> 20:34.393
Shoot! No... you're wrong...

20:34.609 --> 20:38.978
There's a tremendous Ki...
There's a tremendous Ki swelling up!

20:39.196 --> 20:41.027
|-|t must be...

20:43.826 --> 20:47.535
W-What are you talking about? What, exactly...

20:47.747 --> 20:51.740
The smoke! The smoke that
just came out of the ball...!

20:57.840 --> 20:59.751
What a tremendous KI!

21:06.015 --> 21:08.176
H-Hey, up there...

21:08.392 --> 21:10.508
C-Could that possibly be...?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.811
Boo!!

21:23.449 --> 21:26.407
At last, Majin Boo has returned.

21:26.619 --> 21:34.242
But is he really strong enough
to place the Earth in jeopardy?

22:41.902 --> 22:43.278
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.487 --> 22:46.399
This Majin Boo guy has finally been revived.

22:46.615 --> 22:50.107
Be careful, Gohan! I sense an
unbelievably evil Ki from him!

22:50.327 --> 22:52.283
I would never forget such a terrifying face!

22:52.496 --> 22:56.159
This is the end of everything!
We will not make it out alive!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.115
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.335 --> 23:02.578
"Straightaway |nto Despair?!
The Terror of Majin Boo."

23:02.798 --> 23:05.631
Majin Boo's Kijust skyrocketed!
