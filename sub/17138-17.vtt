WEBVTT

00:02.092 --> 00:05.327
Key of A, watch me for the
changes and try to keep up.

00:05.329 --> 00:07.296
Gideon and I have calculated
another Aberration

00:07.298 --> 00:11.433
- in Bhopal, 1912.
- Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

00:14.605 --> 00:16.738
We are history's last line of defense.

00:16.740 --> 00:17.840
I like the sound of that.

00:21.612 --> 00:24.813
Have you gentlemen heard
of the Spear of Destiny?

00:24.815 --> 00:26.882
The Spear could alter reality itself.

00:26.884 --> 00:30.152
Changes to history cause
timequakes and Aberrations,

00:30.154 --> 00:31.720
which we can undo.

00:31.722 --> 00:33.856
Changes to reality, those are permanent.

00:33.858 --> 00:35.657
You're on the run
'cause you're a time remnant.

00:35.659 --> 00:37.025
Now something's chasing you,

00:37.027 --> 00:38.760
trying to correct the Aberration.

00:38.762 --> 00:40.529
One of history's worst monsters.

00:40.531 --> 00:42.331
The Legion have

00:42.333 --> 00:45.133
the Spear of Destiny and
they're like gods now.

00:45.135 --> 00:46.735
It appears that after
the Legion got the Spear

00:46.737 --> 00:49.705
and change reality, they
kept us around as their pets.

00:55.145 --> 00:57.112
You'll be forced to live your lives

00:57.114 --> 00:59.147
in a reality that I created.

00:59.149 --> 01:02.951
We go back in time to 1916

01:02.953 --> 01:04.720
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

01:04.721 --> 01:06.388
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

01:08.492 --> 01:12.394
All right, Gideon, try it now.

01:12.396 --> 01:14.196
All systems nominal, Captain.

01:14.198 --> 01:16.798
That's more like it.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.234
Any luck in contacting
the rest of the team?

01:19.236 --> 01:21.103
Negative, but it stands to reason

01:21.105 --> 01:22.838
that they would be facing
challenges of their own

01:22.840 --> 01:24.940
- in this altered reality.
- Indeed.

01:24.942 --> 01:27.643
Which is why it falls
to us to rescue them.

01:27.645 --> 01:29.444
Engines to full power.

01:32.983 --> 01:34.850
Can you pinpoint our location, Gideon?

01:34.852 --> 01:37.986
- Central City, 2017.
- That's odd.

01:37.988 --> 01:39.688
We must be in some sort of hangar.

01:39.690 --> 01:42.124
One large enough to
accommodate the Waverider.

01:47.064 --> 01:50.899
Gideon, what is that?

01:50.901 --> 01:53.118
- Is that another ship?
- Negative.

01:53.121 --> 01:58.707
It appears to be a desk lamp.

01:58.709 --> 02:01.076
Oh, bollocks.

02:01.078 --> 02:04.313
Right. Engage our
cloak and plot a course.

02:04.315 --> 02:07.215
- Heading, Captain?
- The nearest open window.

02:14.124 --> 02:15.390
Any luck?

02:15.392 --> 02:16.792
You asked me that five minutes ago.

02:16.794 --> 02:18.060
You know, it's not easy trying to get

02:18.062 --> 02:20.262
a 21st century radio to communicate with

02:20.264 --> 02:22.264
a 22nd century time ship.

02:22.266 --> 02:24.366
Thawne never told you
what he did with Rip?

02:24.368 --> 02:27.836
No, we weren't close like that.

02:27.838 --> 02:29.771
How you holding up?

02:29.773 --> 02:31.440
Better than Amaya.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.375
I never knew about you guys.

02:33.377 --> 02:35.043
It's nothing to know.

02:35.045 --> 02:38.880
We were just, you know, figuring it out.

02:38.882 --> 02:40.582
I figured it out.

02:40.584 --> 02:42.551
We've been assuming that
Waverider's broadcasting

02:42.553 --> 02:44.987
- using a quantum frequency, but...
- But only if the quad band

02:44.989 --> 02:46.555
antenna array was in alignment.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.324
- Ray, you are a genius.
- I guess I am.

02:49.326 --> 02:50.759
I kinda forgot what it was like.

02:50.761 --> 02:53.328
So can you communicate with Rip or what?

02:53.330 --> 02:55.597
Sara? Sara, is that you?

02:55.599 --> 02:58.333
Good job, guys. Good job.

02:58.335 --> 03:00.235
We didn't do anything yet.

03:00.237 --> 03:02.604
- Rip?
- Yes, Dr. Palmer,

03:02.606 --> 03:04.606
I've honed in on your location.

03:04.608 --> 03:06.908
Well haul ass over here
and come pick us up.

03:06.910 --> 03:10.812
There may be one small
problem with that.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.127 --> 03:26.795
Look, it's the teeny, weenie Englishman.

03:26.797 --> 03:29.664
Mr. Rory, will you please stop?

03:29.666 --> 03:31.700
Ah, relax.

03:35.806 --> 03:39.608
Why would Thawne use the
Spear of Destiny to shrink you?

03:39.610 --> 03:41.276
Uh, I don't believe he did.

03:41.278 --> 03:44.646
I'm assuming that he
used Dr. Palmer's exosuit.

03:44.648 --> 03:48.050
Oh. Well then, he must
still have it in his lab.

03:48.052 --> 03:50.447
We gotta steal it back and
then we can unshrink the ship.

03:50.450 --> 03:52.454
- And then what?
- Rip, we have a plan

03:52.456 --> 03:54.990
to put reality back as it was.

03:54.992 --> 03:56.758
But you're not gonna like it.

04:07.204 --> 04:09.071
Haircut, where to now?

04:09.073 --> 04:10.705
Uh, I don't know.

04:10.707 --> 04:12.641
I never exactly saw my exosuit here.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.743
I just figured, where
else would Thawne hide it?

04:14.745 --> 04:16.511
All right, let's split up.

04:18.769 --> 04:20.336
Psst, Ray!

04:22.553 --> 04:25.020
Ah. Yes.

04:25.022 --> 04:27.756
Oh, I have missed you.

04:27.758 --> 04:28.990
Really, dude?

04:28.992 --> 04:31.593
I will never, ever leave you again.

04:31.595 --> 04:33.195
Rip, we found the suit.

04:33.197 --> 04:34.663
You need to close in on our position

04:34.665 --> 04:36.932
before I have to watch
Ray do anymore weird stuff.

04:36.934 --> 04:39.101
En route.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.903
- Weird stuff?
- Yeah, you got issues, dude.

04:47.511 --> 04:51.813
We got two more
rent-a-thugs down the hall.

04:51.814 --> 04:54.048
I thought that Thawne
should've killed you morons

04:54.051 --> 04:57.052
at the reactor.

04:57.054 --> 04:59.955
- Ah!
- Then I realized,

04:59.957 --> 05:04.993
now I get to kill the Legends myself.

05:06.963 --> 05:12.533
Gideon, fire! Fire everything!

05:12.536 --> 05:16.037
Aww, isn't that adorable?

05:16.039 --> 05:18.073
- Is that the best you got?
- How about this?

05:21.745 --> 05:25.013
Sara, reinforcements
will be on their way.

05:27.985 --> 05:29.284
We're heading to you, Ray.

05:29.286 --> 05:31.653
Let's blow the roof off this place.

05:31.655 --> 05:37.259
All right, Rip. Keep
the Waverider steady.

05:47.003 --> 05:52.149
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:54.787 --> 05:56.645
We have returned to
the Battle of the Somme

05:56.647 --> 05:58.747
- in the year 1916.
- And apparently,

05:58.749 --> 06:01.183
we're ready to destroy time
itself by interfering in events

06:01.185 --> 06:02.918
that we've already participated in.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.287
If that's what it takes
to save Amaya, count me in.

06:05.289 --> 06:06.755
Yeah, there's no way
I'm letting Grey go out

06:06.757 --> 06:08.123
as one of Thawne's lackeys.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.158
We can't allow Doomworld to continue

06:10.160 --> 06:12.827
- no matter what the risk.
- Okay. Well, look,

06:12.829 --> 06:14.429
like time, reality needs to set.

06:14.431 --> 06:16.932
Essentially, we're in a
race. Not against time,

06:16.934 --> 06:19.868
but from a reality wave
initiating from 2017.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.236
All the more reason to get moving.

06:21.238 --> 06:23.071
At the very least, we need to mitigate

06:23.073 --> 06:26.041
the scope of the time
paradox by avoiding contact

06:26.043 --> 06:29.477
with our former selves at all costs.

06:29.479 --> 06:31.947
So all we have to do is
help us... I mean, them...

06:31.948 --> 06:35.182
Destroy the Spear without them
knowing that we're helping.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.818
- Kinda like Secret Santa.
- We already know

06:36.820 --> 06:38.320
where the Blood of Christ is.

06:38.322 --> 06:41.656
So me, you and Ray, we go
back to the Church of Amiens

06:41.658 --> 06:44.025
and we leave the Blood for
our former selves to find.

06:44.027 --> 06:46.094
I got a question.

06:46.096 --> 06:50.131
What happens to us when our
former selves destroy the Spear?

06:50.133 --> 06:52.801
Well, we cease to exist.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.302
Because we never would have existed

06:54.304 --> 06:56.438
if the Legion hadn't gotten the Spear.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.007
You're saying we're the Aberrations.

07:03.213 --> 07:04.913
In order to save the world,

07:04.915 --> 07:06.348
we have to erase ourselves.

07:06.350 --> 07:09.584
Huh, listen. Why don't
we just go to Aruba,

07:09.586 --> 07:12.320
get drunk... what?

07:12.322 --> 07:15.724
Sunshine. Mai tais.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.860
Girls in... bikinis.

07:21.932 --> 07:25.233
- All right, Ray. You're up.
- I'm on it.

07:28.038 --> 07:29.537
Pardon me.

07:29.539 --> 07:31.273
Excuse me.

07:31.275 --> 07:33.257
Coming through.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.043
Don't mind the tiny man flying through

07:35.045 --> 07:37.545
the middle of no man's land!

07:37.547 --> 07:40.248
I'm closing in on the
Blood's burial spot, Captain.

07:42.552 --> 07:45.120
I'm here.

08:04.041 --> 08:07.409
Well, that was easier
the second time around.

08:12.316 --> 08:15.717
I knew you idiots would
come back from 2017.

08:15.719 --> 08:17.619
Apart from being incredibly stupid,

08:17.621 --> 08:19.754
you are just so predictable.

08:19.756 --> 08:21.389
Give me back the vial.

08:25.762 --> 08:27.228
What vial?

08:27.230 --> 08:30.098
Ray? Ray, get out of there!

08:30.100 --> 08:33.134
You know, my allies
keep giving me the same,

08:33.135 --> 08:35.370
simple piece of advice.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.226
They were right.

08:58.228 --> 09:00.428
I should've done that ages ago.

09:02.199 --> 09:03.365
Hey, what are you doing?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.509
You're gonna get yourself killed!

09:04.511 --> 09:06.224
- We have to get him...
- Sara, you can't!

09:06.227 --> 09:09.637
- Gideon...
- Sara! Sara.

09:09.639 --> 09:11.373
He's gone.

09:25.876 --> 09:27.409
So what?

09:27.411 --> 09:30.579
Haircut said it himself,
we're all Aberrations

09:30.581 --> 09:32.080
living on borrowed time.

09:32.082 --> 09:35.183
Besides, he's alive and well in 1916.

09:35.185 --> 09:38.253
Mick's right. The
mission hasn't changed.

09:38.255 --> 09:39.788
Except we can't destroy the Spear

09:39.790 --> 09:41.389
because we don't have
the Blood of Christ.

09:41.391 --> 09:43.792
So we steal the spear
and get it out of 1916.

09:43.794 --> 09:45.560
Now, you do realize that
there's a big problem

09:45.562 --> 09:46.861
with that plan, Sara.

09:46.863 --> 09:49.097
The other us's have the Spear.

09:49.099 --> 09:52.867
Oh, never stolen anything
from myself before.

09:52.869 --> 09:53.851
Could be interesting.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.637
Ugh, need I remind you

09:55.639 --> 09:58.373
that we cannot interact with ourselves.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.342
Which is why the three of you

10:00.344 --> 10:02.577
are gonna sneak into the other Waverider

10:02.579 --> 10:04.646
while the other you's are at the church.

10:04.648 --> 10:07.916
Now that... That sounds like a plan.

10:07.918 --> 10:10.285
I suggest you hurry. Events
are already in motion.

10:10.287 --> 10:11.987
Mr. Rory's earlier self is currently

10:11.989 --> 10:13.989
being contacted by Mr. Snart.

10:13.991 --> 10:16.024
All right, if we're gonna
go impersonating ourselves...

10:16.026 --> 10:19.194
- You're gonna need a haircut.
- Yeah.

10:19.196 --> 10:22.897
Not for nothing, but Aruba
would've been a better option.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.267
You're not real.

10:26.269 --> 10:28.370
You're an illumination.

10:28.372 --> 10:32.407
- A hallucination.
- Yeah, that's it.

10:34.878 --> 10:37.746
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

10:51.561 --> 10:53.428
And how was the reunion?

10:53.430 --> 10:56.097
I'm gonna let him,
uh, spin out for a bit,

10:56.099 --> 11:00.402
then go in for the kill, so to speak.

11:00.404 --> 11:02.070
- Gentlemen.
- What the hell

11:02.072 --> 11:04.239
- is going on here?
- That's what I was gonna ask.

11:04.241 --> 11:05.407
Aren't you supposed to be searching for

11:05.409 --> 11:07.375
- the Kalabros Manuscript?
- I was.

11:07.377 --> 11:09.010
And I found him and I brought him here.

11:09.012 --> 11:11.012
We no longer need the Manuscript.

11:11.014 --> 11:13.381
We have a different problem.
The Legends are here.

11:13.383 --> 11:15.250
We know. I just punched Mick.

11:15.252 --> 11:17.152
Not those Legends.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.421
And I'm not your Eobard.
I'm from the future.

11:19.423 --> 11:20.722
Yeah, what else is new?

11:20.724 --> 11:22.991
Okay. I mean your future.

11:22.993 --> 11:24.926
One where we have the Spear of Destiny.

11:24.928 --> 11:27.662
And the Legends from that
future are here now, too.

11:27.664 --> 11:29.330
Wait, there are two sets of Legends?

11:29.332 --> 11:32.734
- When do I get to rob a bank?
- Just deal with them.

11:32.736 --> 11:35.203
Where do you think you're going?

11:35.205 --> 11:38.707
To get backup.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.976
I hate when he does that.

11:51.788 --> 11:53.988
- You know what to do.
- We'll hang back

11:53.990 --> 11:55.623
and make sure everybody
sticks to the script

11:55.625 --> 11:57.759
Okay, I figure we got
about an hour before we...

11:57.761 --> 11:59.794
Shut up, pretty. I'm calling the shots.

11:59.796 --> 12:02.630
I'm the thief.
Englishman, disable Gideon.

12:02.632 --> 12:04.733
We can't risk her blowing our cover.

12:07.971 --> 12:09.904
You round up everyone in the library.

12:09.906 --> 12:11.806
Make sure the coast is clear.

12:11.808 --> 12:14.008
Then I can snatch the item.

12:14.010 --> 12:17.011
You know what? This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

12:17.013 --> 12:21.282
Hey. What are you guys doing?
You just left for the church.

12:21.284 --> 12:23.184
So we did. And now we're back.

12:23.186 --> 12:25.620
The church was a dead end, I'm afraid.

12:25.622 --> 12:28.256
- Where's Ray?
- He is returning

12:28.258 --> 12:30.859
Lieutenant Tolkien
to the field hospital.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.629
You guys all right?

12:34.631 --> 12:37.132
Yeah! I'm just seeing double.

12:37.134 --> 12:38.633
Yeah, we're... we're fine. We're fine.

12:38.635 --> 12:40.335
I just need to get to
the library so I can,

12:40.337 --> 12:43.638
you know, locate Christ's blood.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.974
I need to run some repairs on Gideon.

12:45.976 --> 12:49.744
Yeah, and I need to
get the Spear... a beer.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.121
Yeah, well, as long as we get it first.

12:56.124 --> 12:58.686
Are you not supposed to be
guarding the Spear of Destiny?

12:58.688 --> 13:00.922
Mr. Rory offered to spell me.

13:00.924 --> 13:02.757
I thought you and Lieutenant Tolkien

13:02.759 --> 13:04.692
were going to the Church at Amiens.

13:04.694 --> 13:06.194
Uh, yeah, that didn't work out.

13:06.196 --> 13:10.231
But I did happen to find the...

13:10.233 --> 13:14.769
Nate.

13:14.771 --> 13:17.939
I, um, I... I was
just saying that I, uh,

13:17.941 --> 13:21.242
believe I found the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

13:23.647 --> 13:27.419
- So do you wanna tell us?
- Tell you?

13:27.422 --> 13:29.417
- Are you feeling all right?
- You look like

13:29.419 --> 13:31.186
you've seen a ghost.

13:31.188 --> 13:32.954
No... yeah, no. I'm... I'm fine.

13:32.956 --> 13:34.556
Yeah, sorry, I...

13:34.558 --> 13:36.858
I... I think the location
of Gawain and, you know,

13:36.860 --> 13:39.828
the Blood of Christ is in the, um...

13:43.500 --> 13:46.534
Galapagos Islands.

13:46.536 --> 13:49.337
The Blood of Christ is
in the Galapagos Islands?

13:49.339 --> 13:52.407
Yeah. In 1984.

13:52.409 --> 13:54.375
How could a relic from the Crusades

13:54.377 --> 13:58.413
wind up in the Galapagos during
the Reagan Administration?

13:58.415 --> 14:02.116
Perhaps Gideon can help. Gideon?

14:02.118 --> 14:04.586
Oh, no. Where's Gideon?

14:04.588 --> 14:06.221
I'm gonna go and check on her.

14:06.223 --> 14:08.289
I'll come with you.

14:08.291 --> 14:11.693
Why are you looking at me like that?

14:11.695 --> 14:13.261
What's going on?

14:13.263 --> 14:15.530
I miss you so much.

14:15.532 --> 14:17.432
You've been gone for five minutes.

14:22.305 --> 14:23.771
I got it!

14:26.543 --> 14:28.610
Where's pretty?

14:28.612 --> 14:31.212
- Away team, what's your status?
- Uh, we have the Spear,

14:31.214 --> 14:32.881
but Dr. Heywood is running behind.

14:32.883 --> 14:34.515
What the hell is he doing?

14:40.457 --> 14:43.057
- Where the hell have you been?
- Eh, um...

14:43.059 --> 14:45.994
I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I just
got... I got distracted.

14:45.996 --> 14:47.295
We gotta get out of here.

14:47.297 --> 14:49.664
Negative.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.165
We got a new problem.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.268
Your old selves are back.

14:53.270 --> 14:55.970
Hang on. You mean that we've
returned from the church?

14:55.972 --> 14:58.439
Yes, and if you come
out of the ship now,

14:58.441 --> 15:01.476
they'll see you and wreck time itself.

15:01.478 --> 15:04.279
You're trapped in there.

15:04.281 --> 15:05.847
Good one!

15:13.063 --> 15:15.485
We have to stop them
from getting to the ship.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.914
Guys.

15:19.916 --> 15:22.550
We have a... a new problem.

15:22.552 --> 15:25.052
The ship... it's broken.

15:25.054 --> 15:28.356
Uh, well what Sara means
is there's a radiation leak.

15:28.358 --> 15:30.825
- Radiation leak?
- Yes, and it's very dangerous

15:30.827 --> 15:32.093
so we need to keep our distance.

15:32.095 --> 15:33.227
If you could just follow me this way.

15:33.229 --> 15:34.495
Wait, where's Amaya?

15:34.497 --> 15:37.231
She's safe. We got everyone...

15:37.233 --> 15:39.000
off of the ship right away.

15:39.002 --> 15:42.904
Except Grey, who's working
on fixing the ship right now.

15:42.906 --> 15:45.406
I thought you said it was
too dangerous to be on board.

15:45.408 --> 15:47.542
What's a little radiation

15:47.544 --> 15:50.444
for one half of Firestorm?

15:53.449 --> 15:56.684
I assumed we'd be on
our way to 1984 by now.

15:56.686 --> 15:58.686
Yeah, Rip took Gideon offline.

15:58.688 --> 16:01.055
Said something about an efficiency scan,

16:01.057 --> 16:02.690
which should've been done by now.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.792
- How strange.
- Yeah, like how Nate was acting

16:04.794 --> 16:07.595
- in the library.
- Shouldn't Raymond be back

16:07.597 --> 16:09.730
from returning Tolkien to his regiment?

16:09.732 --> 16:11.899
Ray. What's your 20?

16:11.901 --> 16:15.369
Uh, I'm standing right in front of you.

16:15.371 --> 16:18.472
Ray, listen to me: whoever
that is, she's an imposter.

16:18.474 --> 16:21.409
- Take her out.
- What about the other Jax?

16:21.411 --> 16:24.412
Whoa, whoa, wait. There's
a fake version of me, too?

16:24.414 --> 16:26.790
- Yeah.
- Ray, whoever this bozo is,

16:26.793 --> 16:28.282
kick his ass!

16:28.284 --> 16:33.521
- With pleasure.
- Okay. Huh.

16:33.522 --> 16:36.122
- Sorry, Sara.
- For what?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.525
Listening to you.

16:37.527 --> 16:39.126
- Whoa!
- Big dude, chill out, bro!

16:39.128 --> 16:41.395
- What are you doing?
- We're not imposters!

16:41.397 --> 16:44.065
This is madness! What
has come over you people?

16:44.067 --> 16:45.399
If you would...

16:45.401 --> 16:48.669
- Oh, Ray!
- ...just...

16:48.671 --> 16:51.405
let me explain!

16:51.407 --> 16:53.674
If fake me is anything like real me,

16:53.676 --> 16:55.643
Ray's gonna need some help.

16:55.645 --> 16:58.279
Copy that, Captain.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.017
Enough waiting, we
gotta get out of here.

17:03.019 --> 17:05.853
We can't. Our prior selves
are out there right now.

17:05.855 --> 17:08.388
If we leave, they'll see us.

17:08.391 --> 17:09.490
Then don't go.

17:09.492 --> 17:10.891
Whoa.

17:10.893 --> 17:12.593
Mr. Jackson, I can explain.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.127
That you're the Legion in disguisg?

17:14.130 --> 17:17.397
Yeah, I know.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.636
Thawne's face changing
technology is incredible.

17:21.637 --> 17:22.903
Hang on.

17:25.273 --> 17:27.708
I don't think she's an imposter.

17:27.710 --> 17:31.045
This is the genuine Ms.
Lance and Mr. Jackson.

17:31.047 --> 17:32.480
W-what?

17:32.482 --> 17:35.182
But you told us never
to revisit our past.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.018
Why would they do that?

17:37.020 --> 17:38.919
You'll have to ask them that.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.426
They almost made it
off the ship with this.

17:45.427 --> 17:48.662
All right. Who's wearing whose faces?

17:48.665 --> 17:51.332
We are not the Legion.
Believe it or not,

17:51.334 --> 17:53.701
we are actually future
iterations of yourselves

17:53.703 --> 17:55.102
who've travelled back in time to prevent

17:55.104 --> 17:57.371
some form of calamity.

17:57.373 --> 18:00.041
I don't believe it. Why would Rip Hunter

18:00.043 --> 18:02.309
break the first rule of time travel?

18:02.311 --> 18:07.048
I'm asking myself the
very same question.

18:07.050 --> 18:08.883
Oh, bollocks.

18:11.921 --> 18:13.421
What the hell was that?

18:13.423 --> 18:14.855
It's a timequake.

18:14.857 --> 18:17.224
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.627
- Well, that wasn't so bad.
- Yeah, give it time.

18:19.629 --> 18:21.262
Whose bright idea was it

18:21.264 --> 18:24.565
to do the one thing that
could jeopardize all of time?

18:24.567 --> 18:25.733
Yours.

18:25.735 --> 18:27.468
What the hell are you staring at?

18:27.470 --> 18:29.970
Just imagining what you'd
look like without teeth.

18:29.972 --> 18:31.272
Knock it off, Rory.

18:31.274 --> 18:32.740
I can't believe that even we

18:32.742 --> 18:33.941
would do anything so foolish,

18:33.943 --> 18:35.976
unless something went terribly wrong

18:35.978 --> 18:37.411
the first time you were here.

18:37.413 --> 18:39.580
Uh, I can't help but notice...

18:39.582 --> 18:41.882
Not all of us came back with you.

18:41.884 --> 18:44.418
What happens to us in the future?

18:46.989 --> 18:49.523
Well...

18:49.525 --> 18:52.893
dead, dead, good as dead.

18:52.895 --> 18:54.895
Look, the Spear ended
up in the Legion's hands.

18:54.897 --> 18:56.764
Bad things happened and it sucked.

18:56.766 --> 18:59.266
But if we prevent the Legion
from ever getting the Spear

18:59.268 --> 19:01.435
in the first place, everything
goes back to normal

19:01.437 --> 19:02.837
and you all get to live.

19:05.742 --> 19:10.277
- Where are you going?
- To think.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.079
Perhaps you should go with her.

19:12.081 --> 19:15.616
- Two heads are better than one.
- Yeah.

19:21.591 --> 19:24.792
In the future you're from,
the Legion gets the Spear.

19:24.794 --> 19:27.862
Yes.

19:27.864 --> 19:30.064
So this is my fault.

19:30.066 --> 19:33.634
It's more of a team effort, really.

19:33.636 --> 19:36.604
Can I ask you a question?

19:36.606 --> 19:38.906
Do you wish you would have used it?

19:38.908 --> 19:40.441
- No.
- But you could've

19:40.443 --> 19:42.143
stopped all of this.

19:42.145 --> 19:45.215
You could've erased the
Legion of Doom from existence.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.847
You could have kept your team alive.

19:46.849 --> 19:52.486
You know why I... We can't use it.

19:52.488 --> 19:57.625
The Spear... It draws on our desires,

19:57.627 --> 20:01.428
our weaknesses, our hatred.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.798
Our darkness.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.868
We're not strong enough to wield it.

20:07.870 --> 20:10.137
The spear is a weapon.

20:10.139 --> 20:12.406
And you know what we do with weapons.

20:18.414 --> 20:22.249
Doing some light reading
on Zembezi, I see.

20:22.251 --> 20:24.018
What do you want?

20:24.019 --> 20:26.519
I came here to drop some
future knowledge on you.

20:26.522 --> 20:28.022
You need to do yourself a favor

20:28.024 --> 20:29.723
and stop being the ambassador of chill

20:29.725 --> 20:32.526
and tell Amaya how you feel about her.

20:32.528 --> 20:35.663
Okay. How do I feel about her?

20:35.665 --> 20:38.566
You're in love with her.

20:38.568 --> 20:41.769
Look, I...

20:41.771 --> 20:45.873
I really, really like Amaya.

20:45.875 --> 20:49.476
I saw Leonard Snart put a
gun to her head and kill her.

20:49.478 --> 20:52.179
I watched Amaya die.

20:52.181 --> 20:54.782
I lost her forever.

20:54.784 --> 20:58.719
You understand me?

20:58.721 --> 21:00.588
What do you want me to do?

21:00.590 --> 21:01.956
We all wanna change the future.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.424
I'm not talking about the future.

21:03.426 --> 21:05.559
I'm talking about
changing who you are now.

21:05.561 --> 21:08.529
I want you to do the things
I wish I would've done

21:08.531 --> 21:11.398
instead of the things
I wish I would've said.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.667
You wanna know why?

21:13.669 --> 21:17.304
Because there's nothing... Nothing worse

21:17.306 --> 21:21.008
than looking back at
your life with regret.

21:35.858 --> 21:37.758
- Yep. Still weird.
- Please tell me you two

21:37.760 --> 21:39.393
have figured a way out of this mess.

21:39.395 --> 21:42.563
Uh! Clearly not.

21:42.565 --> 21:44.565
- Was that another timequake?
- I don't think so.

21:44.567 --> 21:46.634
- Someone's firing at us.
- Captain, our shields

21:46.636 --> 21:51.572
- are nearly depleted.
- Copy that.

21:51.574 --> 21:55.609
Sorry, habit.

21:55.611 --> 21:58.712
That was a bit powerful for
World War I air artillery.

22:06.155 --> 22:08.622
That would explain it.

22:08.624 --> 22:10.224
The ship's taking too much damage.

22:10.226 --> 22:11.558
We gotta make a time jump.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.294
I really would not recommend that.

22:14.730 --> 22:17.831
- Outta my way.
- Hey, that's my seat!

22:17.833 --> 22:19.833
Travelling through time with ourselves

22:19.835 --> 22:21.969
could create a paradox
exponentially larger

22:21.971 --> 22:24.038
than the one we have already created.

22:25.727 --> 22:27.474
- What do you think?
- That we have to do

22:27.476 --> 22:28.809
whatever it takes to keep the Spear

22:28.811 --> 22:30.511
out of the Legion's hands.

22:30.513 --> 22:32.313
Hold on.

22:39.288 --> 22:40.955
- What's going on?
- It's the result of us

22:40.957 --> 22:43.023
interacting with our previous selves.

22:43.025 --> 22:44.358
It's a time-storm.

23:04.931 --> 23:06.865
We're still in World War I.

23:06.867 --> 23:08.666
Gideon, get us out of here.

23:08.668 --> 23:10.068
Negative, Captains.

23:10.070 --> 23:11.970
The ship has sustained critical damage.

23:11.972 --> 23:13.938
Well, good news. The time-storm seems

23:13.940 --> 23:16.274
to have caused a temporary ceasefire.

23:16.276 --> 23:19.911
The bad news is the Legion of
Doom's still trying to kill us.

23:19.913 --> 23:22.280
Wait, how far do you
even think we'll be able

23:22.281 --> 23:24.715
- to make it out there?
- You only have to make it

23:24.718 --> 23:26.117
as far as the other Waverider.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.987
You want us to time jump together again?

23:28.989 --> 23:30.755
Uh... you saw what just happened.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.191
We won't be time jumping together.

23:33.193 --> 23:36.728
You're not coming with us.

23:36.730 --> 23:39.864
This has always been a
one-way ticket for us.

23:42.502 --> 23:46.204
Your team has to get
the Spear of Destiny

23:46.206 --> 23:49.908
away from here.

23:49.910 --> 23:52.010
We won't fail you guys.

23:56.550 --> 24:00.118
- Guys, we've got company.
- I see 'em.

24:01.388 --> 24:03.454
Everybody clear on the plan?

24:03.456 --> 24:06.157
Run like hell. Try not to die.

24:06.159 --> 24:09.060
What about you guys? You ready?

24:09.062 --> 24:10.628
Other than the fact
that I can't Firestorm

24:10.630 --> 24:11.896
and Nate can't Steel?

24:11.898 --> 24:13.998
You bet your sweet ass we're ready.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.293
- Damn it.
- Damien, I think we should

24:42.295 --> 24:45.263
- go back to basics.
- Yeah, you're right.

24:45.265 --> 24:48.333
Killing's gotten so gosh
darn impersonal lately.

24:49.369 --> 24:52.103
Ah.

24:56.776 --> 24:58.576
Uh, uhh!

25:02.282 --> 25:03.882
Ah, ahh.

25:10.991 --> 25:12.624
No!

25:18.965 --> 25:21.399
No.

25:21.401 --> 25:25.069
Jefferson, no, please. Please!

25:28.074 --> 25:31.542
Ah!

25:34.881 --> 25:37.482
Grey!

25:37.484 --> 25:39.450
Come on, Grey.

25:39.452 --> 25:41.119
Come on, come on.

25:48.361 --> 25:50.662
Ahh!

25:50.664 --> 25:53.264
Let him go, Mick.

25:53.266 --> 25:55.133
I'm not listening to you anymore.

25:55.135 --> 25:58.303
Come on, is that any way
to talk to your old partner?

25:58.305 --> 26:01.339
I don't have a partner. I have a team.

26:01.341 --> 26:04.142
Yeah, Darhk said you'd gone soft.

26:04.144 --> 26:07.111
Lemme fix that for you.

26:09.349 --> 26:11.883
Uh.

26:11.885 --> 26:15.119
Mick, no! No!

26:20.093 --> 26:23.027
- What's your problem?
- You're... you're alive!

26:23.029 --> 26:26.497
You hug me, I'll kill you.

26:26.499 --> 26:28.032
Okay. Later.

26:32.105 --> 26:34.138
Hey! The Waverider's just around...

26:34.140 --> 26:36.708
Ahh!

26:36.710 --> 26:41.679
I thought you were made of steel.

26:41.681 --> 26:42.880
No!

26:42.882 --> 26:45.149
Get this in the ship.

26:45.151 --> 26:49.387
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

26:54.594 --> 26:56.127
Ah, ahh!

27:09.075 --> 27:10.541
Ahh!

27:10.543 --> 27:12.310
Ohh!

27:15.482 --> 27:17.148
Ah.

27:18.885 --> 27:21.219
What are you waiting for?

27:21.221 --> 27:23.721
Do it.

27:23.723 --> 27:25.957
Death would be too kind.

27:29.095 --> 27:31.262
Nice work. Both of you.

27:31.264 --> 27:32.630
Where's the Spear?

27:32.632 --> 27:34.699
You took it to the rendezvous point.

27:34.701 --> 27:36.100
Oh, did I? Right.

27:36.102 --> 27:38.136
If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916,

27:38.138 --> 27:39.971
get to the ship now.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.673
That means you, Amaya.

27:42.675 --> 27:47.145
Nathaniel.

27:47.147 --> 27:50.014
Don't be a douche.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.050
Excuse me?

27:52.052 --> 27:54.986
I won't, bro.

28:11.037 --> 28:14.105
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't jinx it.

28:16.409 --> 28:17.909
Aw, he jinxed it!

28:17.911 --> 28:21.612
I hate that guy.

28:24.884 --> 28:26.517
Not that guy.

28:28.521 --> 28:31.422
These guys!

28:34.661 --> 28:36.561
You travelled back in
time to help yourselves,

28:36.563 --> 28:38.262
I figured I could do the same.

28:38.264 --> 28:39.630
You know, it's true what they say.

28:39.632 --> 28:42.066
If you want something done right,

28:42.068 --> 28:44.202
you really have to do it yourself.

28:52.811 --> 28:57.810
Give me the Spear and
I'll spare your team.

28:57.812 --> 28:59.145
You can go to hell.

28:59.147 --> 29:01.547
No, but I'll make a hell for you.

29:01.549 --> 29:04.550
Do you really wanna lose another one?

29:04.552 --> 29:06.719
Last chance.

29:06.721 --> 29:08.721
Use the Spear.

29:11.926 --> 29:14.026
B'khi-eel.

29:14.028 --> 29:15.761
Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

29:15.763 --> 29:19.365
K'i-aheen. Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

29:23.438 --> 29:28.240
It can't be me. Use it. Fix the world.

29:28.242 --> 29:30.276
- Just do it, Sara!
- Look, I can't.

29:30.278 --> 29:31.710
There's too much darkness inside of me.

29:31.712 --> 29:32.945
I can't control it.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.719
I believe in you.

29:40.721 --> 29:42.588
You're stronger than you know.

29:58.673 --> 30:03.642
There's no place like home.

30:03.644 --> 30:04.977
Well, the cork broke off,

30:04.979 --> 30:08.314
but I think I managed to salvage it.

30:08.316 --> 30:09.882
Here.

30:16.323 --> 30:18.181
To doing movie night more often.

30:23.614 --> 30:27.916
This never happened.

30:27.919 --> 30:32.938
This is the Spear doing this.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.774
This isn't real.

30:35.776 --> 30:37.910
No, it's not,

30:37.912 --> 30:40.513
but it can be.

30:40.515 --> 30:44.950
You can remake reality
however you see fit.

30:51.392 --> 30:55.895
You were always
the better of us, Laurel.

30:55.897 --> 30:59.498
You were the strong one.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.868
I'm damaged.

31:02.870 --> 31:04.637
I know.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.981
The Gambit,

31:15.983 --> 31:18.150
Lian Yu,

31:18.152 --> 31:20.085
League of Assassins,

31:20.087 --> 31:22.321
you dying.

31:22.323 --> 31:25.524
I could take it all back.

31:25.526 --> 31:27.459
But you won't.

31:30.364 --> 31:33.032
Everything...

31:33.034 --> 31:36.068
that has happened to me...

31:36.070 --> 31:39.805
All the suffering that I endured,

31:39.807 --> 31:44.376
it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?

31:44.378 --> 31:47.713
The Spear doesn't need
someone pure of heart.

31:47.715 --> 31:52.084
It needs someone strong
enough to do the right thing.

31:52.086 --> 31:55.321
Sara, it needs you.

31:55.323 --> 31:58.891
Even if doing the right thing...

31:58.893 --> 32:01.527
means not having you back?

32:02.930 --> 32:05.531
I'm never too far away.

32:11.539 --> 32:13.372
I love you.

32:13.374 --> 32:16.475
I love you, too.

32:21.182 --> 32:24.016
Too slow, Ms. Lance.

32:24.018 --> 32:26.385
Far too slow.

32:26.387 --> 32:30.756
To think you had actual godhood

32:30.758 --> 32:34.026
literally in your grasp.

32:34.028 --> 32:37.029
Well, I'm not going to make the
mistake I made the first time.

32:37.031 --> 32:40.866
I'm going to erase
you all from existence.

32:40.868 --> 32:42.368
You won't even be dead.

32:44.572 --> 32:46.705
B'khi-eel. Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

32:46.707 --> 32:48.040
K'i-aheen.

32:48.042 --> 32:49.575
Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

32:51.345 --> 32:57.216
I may have made one
small change to reality.

32:57.218 --> 33:01.220
You depowered the Spear.

33:01.222 --> 33:05.424
Well, I guess we'll just have
to do this the old fashioned way.

33:05.426 --> 33:08.327
I am going to drive
this through your heart.

33:10.831 --> 33:14.366
Yeah. About that...

33:20.374 --> 33:21.774
No.

34:21.569 --> 34:23.101
You did it.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.971
You would've done the same thing.

34:30.010 --> 34:33.078
Remember, Legends never die.

34:40.321 --> 34:43.255
Really? "Goonies"?

34:43.257 --> 34:45.290
What's a goonie?

34:45.292 --> 34:47.059
Ehh.

34:59.481 --> 35:04.584
All right, Malcolm is back
in 2016, where he belongs.

35:04.586 --> 35:07.487
- In prison?
- No.

35:07.489 --> 35:09.188
His crappy apartment.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.224
And what are your
plans for the two of us?

35:11.226 --> 35:14.227
We're dead in 2017, remember?

35:14.229 --> 35:17.130
I'm not taking you back to 2017.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.206
Should've done this in France, Mick.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.909
Could've saved us both a lot of time.

35:29.911 --> 35:32.738
I didn't bring you here
to kill you, Leonard.

35:32.741 --> 35:35.175
So what are we doing here?

35:35.178 --> 35:38.351
This is where Thawne
recruited you for the Legion.

35:43.224 --> 35:46.259
I'm gonna wipe your memory
and put you on the right path.

35:46.261 --> 35:49.395
You mean the path where I
join up with some Brit twit

35:49.397 --> 35:52.165
and die trying to save the world?

35:52.167 --> 35:56.469
No, you die trying to save your friends.

35:56.471 --> 35:58.905
Still a death sentence.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.774
You know what your
punishment is, Leonard?

36:01.776 --> 36:04.944
You end up being a better man.

36:04.946 --> 36:06.713
And so do I.

36:06.715 --> 36:08.181
Better?

36:08.183 --> 36:10.249
You mean softer.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.452
No.

36:12.454 --> 36:14.253
I mean better.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.391
Mm.

36:28.303 --> 36:30.236
All right, so let me get this straight.

36:30.238 --> 36:33.373
In retaliation for me
helping kill your team,

36:33.375 --> 36:35.341
bending reality and torturing you,

36:35.343 --> 36:39.145
I'm to wear this ridiculous
outfit and shoes without socks?

36:39.147 --> 36:40.913
Just setting things right.

36:40.915 --> 36:44.717
You mean setting me on the
path to killing your sister.

36:44.719 --> 36:47.553
I've already made that choice.

36:47.555 --> 36:49.722
I'm okay with it.

36:49.724 --> 36:52.325
And so is Laurel.

36:52.327 --> 36:53.960
And how do you know that?

37:03.138 --> 37:07.340
Hey, Gideon said we're
going back to 1942.

37:07.342 --> 37:09.842
The mission's over. The
Legion's been put back

37:09.844 --> 37:12.812
in their proper places
in the timeline, so...

37:12.814 --> 37:15.448
now it's my turn.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.166
Okay, um...

37:18.169 --> 37:20.286
Well, if you don't
mind, I'd like to get off

37:20.288 --> 37:24.424
- at that stop with you.
- What?

37:24.426 --> 37:26.659
Look, I lost you once already,

37:26.661 --> 37:31.164
even though it was a different
me and a different you.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.533
And I don't ever wanna do that again.

37:33.535 --> 37:37.103
Or at all.

37:37.105 --> 37:39.072
I don't know what to say.

37:39.074 --> 37:42.942
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."

37:42.944 --> 37:46.079
I can't say that, Nathaniel.

37:46.081 --> 37:50.349
Because I don't want to go back to 1942.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.985
I know that I'm supposed to.

37:52.987 --> 37:55.588
I know I have a destiny and
that we shouldn't damage time

37:55.590 --> 37:59.092
any more than we already
have, but I have to believe

37:59.094 --> 38:01.961
that time is stronger than that.

38:01.963 --> 38:05.198
And that if I have a destiny,

38:05.200 --> 38:07.567
it'll wait for me.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.478
Hey, you going on a trip?

38:18.480 --> 38:21.881
Uh, yes, in fact.

38:21.883 --> 38:24.183
I was joking.

38:24.185 --> 38:26.385
Right. Yes, well, we both know

38:26.387 --> 38:28.187
that I don't have a
sense of humor at times.

38:28.189 --> 38:31.861
But, uh, yes, I am taking my leave.

38:31.864 --> 38:33.397
What do you mean, "leave"?

38:33.400 --> 38:35.561
This team has functioned
far better in my absence

38:35.563 --> 38:37.563
than it ever did under my leadership.

38:37.565 --> 38:41.734
- You saved reality itself.
- Well, you were there, too.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.704
Yes, but I've realized
that there's nothing further

38:44.706 --> 38:46.672
for me to teach you.

38:46.674 --> 38:48.674
- Any of you.
- So, what?

38:48.676 --> 38:51.911
You're just gonna walk out
of here and not say good-bye?

38:51.913 --> 38:53.980
I was going to borrow
the jump ship, actually.

38:53.982 --> 38:55.982
I think Mick would call that stealing.

38:55.984 --> 38:57.817
Oh, yes. Well, maybe Mr. Rory

38:57.819 --> 39:00.987
has had somewhat of an affect on me.

39:00.989 --> 39:03.189
And you on me, Captain.

39:03.191 --> 39:05.558
Ah, I'm no longer the captain.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.894
You are.

39:07.896 --> 39:12.064
And in that spirit...

39:12.066 --> 39:15.434
permission to depart, Captain Lance.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.637
Permission granted.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.376
Stay out of trouble.

39:23.378 --> 39:25.244
What, without you lot?

39:25.246 --> 39:27.580
I think that'll actually be quite easy.

39:42.664 --> 39:45.765
Mick, you wanna do the
honors? Plot a course?

39:45.767 --> 39:47.633
You earned it.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.703
Gideon, set a course for Aruba.

39:50.705 --> 39:52.138
Roger that, Mr. Rory.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.274
Setting a course for
Aruba, the year 2017.

39:56.878 --> 39:58.477
- What was that?
- This is what happens

39:58.479 --> 40:01.247
when you put Mr. Rory
in charge of navigation.

40:01.249 --> 40:03.349
In fact, it was another time-storm.

40:03.351 --> 40:05.885
It seems the disruption
you created in 1916

40:05.887 --> 40:07.687
was just the start.

40:12.227 --> 40:14.260
We've been ejected out
of the Temporal Zone.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.731
- Get ready for a hard landing.
- Oh, come on!

40:18.733 --> 40:21.968
Can we please go five minutes
without crashing the Waverider?

40:35.450 --> 40:37.583
Is everyone okay?

40:37.585 --> 40:38.851
This ain't Aruba.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.021
No, this is Los Angeles, 2017.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.990
Oh, boy.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.653
Guys.

40:51.656 --> 40:54.459
I think we broke time.
