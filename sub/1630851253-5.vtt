WEBVTT

00:36.500 --> 00:39.250
Two nights in a row.
We should talk to him.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.041
I just don't like not knowing what he's…

00:43.875 --> 00:46.916
Rumor is he's been
spending a lot of time with Miss Greene.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.333
Well, good for him.

00:53.291 --> 00:56.791
He's an adult. If he can find
just a little comfort in his…

00:58.541 --> 00:59.541
Good for him.

01:01.083 --> 01:01.958
[Ed chuckles]

01:06.000 --> 01:09.333
Late start this morning.
Looks like it'll just be us.

01:10.833 --> 01:11.708
[Warren] We can handle it.

01:16.000 --> 01:16.916
[sighs]

01:21.958 --> 01:23.166
[vibrating]

01:29.958 --> 01:31.000
[Mildred] Mornin', you.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.541
Wow, you look…

01:37.625 --> 01:42.291
Do you like it? I dug it out of that
footlocker in the closet upstairs.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.500
I mean, most of those
haven't seen the light of day in decades,

01:46.583 --> 01:48.250
but then again, neither have I.

01:49.416 --> 01:53.041
Still, I think it fits pretty well,
don't you think?

01:54.916 --> 01:55.750
Shall we?

01:57.291 --> 01:59.458
[Joanie] I know he's a troubled boy.

02:00.666 --> 02:01.666
Always has been.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.208
His daddy never
did right by him and me, well…

02:07.750 --> 02:09.625
I did my best.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.833
I did what I could, but I ain't perfect.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.916
I work two jobs.

02:20.208 --> 02:23.958
Mainland jobs, and still that
don't provide enough for his sisters.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.750
Which is why he does what he does.

02:29.125 --> 02:33.666
Money's gotta come from somewhere,
and he puts food on the table.

02:36.291 --> 02:38.916
Not that that much matters
to you, does it, Sheriff? Hmm?

02:39.708 --> 02:42.666
Law's the law, no matter the circumstance,
ain't that right?

02:43.208 --> 02:46.583
I'm not judging, Joanie,
I only said it's not unheard of.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.541
-Bowl takin' off for a few--
-Bill!

02:49.083 --> 02:51.208
His name is Bill.

02:52.583 --> 02:56.791
His so-called friends called him Bowl
when he started selling the weed, and…

02:58.166 --> 03:01.458
[sighs] Well, at least
they didn't call him Bong.

03:02.125 --> 03:06.833
Look, if you and these folks
here on the island

03:06.916 --> 03:09.333
don't give two shits about a missing boy,

03:09.416 --> 03:12.333
well, then, I don't know
why you all keep lining up at church,

03:12.416 --> 03:16.791
making a big show of how pious you are
because you sure as shit ain't Christians.

03:16.875 --> 03:19.500
-Ma'am, I'm not Christian.
-You know what I'm getting at.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.791
[clicks tongue] I've been in touch
with my counterparts on the mainland,

03:23.875 --> 03:25.333
and they've been in touch with Bowl…

03:26.333 --> 03:29.625
Bill's employers and known acquaintances.
We'll find him.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.958
What about these folks here on the island,
you talking to them?

03:34.041 --> 03:37.083
'Cause mainlanders are one thing,
but islanders know.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.250
Islanders always know.

03:39.333 --> 03:40.666
I had a word with Joe Collie.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.958
Best I can tell, he was
the last person to see him on the island.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.791
-Was he sober?
-Ma'am?

03:45.875 --> 03:47.916
When you talked to him, was he sober?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, can't say for certain with Joe.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.791
-You never can, but he--
-Talk to him again.

03:54.541 --> 03:57.458
-Look, I don't think Joe--
-You talk to him again!

03:57.541 --> 03:59.083
You didn't know him!

03:59.791 --> 04:01.375
These people here really didn't know him,

04:01.458 --> 04:03.041
and if they did,
they didn't give two shits,

04:03.125 --> 04:05.083
but that's not supposed to matter.

04:06.208 --> 04:12.333
When something like this happens,
we are all supposed to be the same.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.375
Wait, you're saying every night?
No morning masses at all?

04:23.208 --> 04:24.291
[Sturge] Time bein', yeah.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.000
Father Paul probably just needs
another morning or two

04:28.083 --> 04:29.708
to recover from that head cold,

04:29.791 --> 04:33.333
but he should be up and about tonight.
Isn't that right, Sturge?

04:34.458 --> 04:36.250
[Sturge] Yes, sir. Um… [clears throat]

04:36.333 --> 04:41.083
I spoke to him myself in the morning,
and, uh, he's doin' much better.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.708
That's right, and Dolly spoke to him, too.

04:43.791 --> 04:45.958
And he's got a few things
to say about Good Friday.

04:46.041 --> 04:47.250
Isn't that right, honey?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.708
Dolly? You…

04:53.041 --> 04:54.166
[indistinct chatter]

05:02.708 --> 05:04.583
Millie. Is that you?

05:05.958 --> 05:07.291
The last time I checked.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.833
Is there no morning mass today?
I was so looking forward.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.291
No, it's…

05:15.708 --> 05:17.916
Wow! Look at you.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.916
[Leeza] Oh, my God.
Miss Gunning looks so much… Mom?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.958
[voice breaking] I'm sorry, sweetie.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.291
It's just, um…

05:29.958 --> 05:31.875
What a time to be alive.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
[knocks on door]

05:39.000 --> 05:39.916
[Annie] Oh.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.291
-[Erin] Hi, Mrs. Flynn.
-[Annie] Oh, darling. Oh.

05:43.708 --> 05:47.000
Honey, hi. I heard about…

05:47.583 --> 05:50.958
Riley told us. You aren't alone.

05:51.625 --> 05:52.625
[Erin] Is he here?

05:53.250 --> 05:58.041
[Annie] Uh… no. No, he's not.
To be honest, I thought he was with you.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.541
[knocks on door]

06:00.625 --> 06:01.500
[Hassan] Joe?

06:11.125 --> 06:12.041
-[Ed] Got it?
-[Warren] Yep.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.208
[crate thuds]

06:33.166 --> 06:34.333
[Erin] Have you seen Riley?

06:34.416 --> 06:36.125
[inaudible conversation]

06:48.791 --> 06:49.791
[Ed] Everything okay?

06:50.666 --> 06:53.625
[Warren] Yeah, Riley's, uh,
just MIA, I guess.

06:53.708 --> 06:54.541
Huh?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.916
He's not with Erin Greene then?

06:58.208 --> 06:59.125
I guess not.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.041
God damn it, Riley.

07:08.958 --> 07:11.708
He's just gonna piss it all away?
Even after all the…

07:12.291 --> 07:13.166
God.

07:14.375 --> 07:16.000
What the hell's the matter with him?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.500
Just let him. Let him.

07:20.166 --> 07:24.208
What the hell can we even do?
If he's not even gonna… God damn it!

07:24.791 --> 07:26.708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Warren.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.333
Sorry. Here.

07:36.875 --> 07:41.333
Yeah, C-O-double-L-I-E. Joseph.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.291
Four, twenty-two, sixty-nine.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.083
Great. I'd appreciate that.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.541
All right, thanks. Thanks, Mike.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.041
Sorry to interrupt.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.416
Oh. No, no. I was just tracking, uh…

07:57.208 --> 07:58.750
What can I do for you, Miss Greene?

08:00.125 --> 08:03.000
-Yeah… It's probably nothing.
-Most things are.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.833
It could be, I don't know.

08:07.625 --> 08:11.750
I don't know what this could be.
Um, and it's not an official report,

08:11.833 --> 08:14.666
because it hasn't been 24 or 48 hours.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.708
I don't know how long to wait.
And you're gonna laugh at me.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.583
But I need to report a missing person.

08:25.666 --> 08:26.541
Who?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.375
Riley Flynn.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.791
He was supposed to come to my house
last night, but he didn't.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.416
And I checked with his family and…

08:35.500 --> 08:37.666
This morning and this afternoon,
and they haven't seen him.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.500
Your house… Are you two--

08:39.583 --> 08:43.583
No. I mean, not really.
We've been spending time together, but…

08:45.166 --> 08:48.583
He wasn't on the ferry, I checked.
So he's not on the mainland.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.833
And his phone
just rings and rings and rings.

08:50.916 --> 08:52.666
Mmm-hmm. Did he say anything?

08:52.750 --> 08:56.625
Anything that you, uh, look at now
thinking back that's off, or--

08:56.708 --> 08:59.833
No, nothing.
He said he would come to my house.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.583
-Well, sure, but maybe he just got--
-He said he would come to my house.

09:06.750 --> 09:07.625
All right.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
[clears throat]

09:12.458 --> 09:14.291
-[pen clicks]
-All right, last time you saw him?

09:15.083 --> 09:17.125
Yesterday morning when we woke up.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.083
He went to AA
at St. Patrick's with Joe Collie--

09:20.166 --> 09:22.041
Joe was there? You sure?

09:22.125 --> 09:25.708
I don't know. I just assume so
because he's going to those meetings.

09:25.791 --> 09:29.291
And then he went [inhales deeply]
home for dinner.

09:29.375 --> 09:34.500
His parents said so. And then he said
he was going to meet me, and then nothing.

09:34.583 --> 09:37.250
All right, and what did you
talk about yesterday morning?

09:37.333 --> 09:40.583
You know, plans for the day,
a dream that he had last night.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.666
And what did you talk about
the night before?

09:47.625 --> 09:50.708
Okay, listen. I believe you.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.208
All right. I'm not trying to pry.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.041
I'm hoping he said something,
anything that might tell us where he went.

09:57.125 --> 09:59.958
All right? It could be something little.
Something he forgot.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.666
His state of mind is important,

10:02.250 --> 10:05.333
because when I go shaking trees,
and I will…

10:06.791 --> 10:09.750
If it turns out he's on
some bender in a mainland hotel,

10:10.416 --> 10:14.583
he might have hinted. That's all.
All right? So that's all I'm looking for.

10:16.041 --> 10:16.916
Okay?

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
What did you two talk about?

10:22.916 --> 10:23.833
Death.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.125
We talked about what happens

10:27.291 --> 10:28.833
when you die.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.083
Well, um, see,
that's what I'm talking about.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.500
Yes, that's why I'm here.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.125
All right.
Did you bring up the topic or did he?

10:41.416 --> 10:43.791
I've been asking
myself that all day, I don't…

10:44.541 --> 10:48.250
I think it was on both of our minds
because I had lost…

10:52.166 --> 10:53.375
I miscarried.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.125
I'm sorry, I…

11:03.583 --> 11:06.416
I am pretty sure
that he brought up the idea,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.875
and I leaned into it pretty hard.

11:10.041 --> 11:12.916
-And what did he say about it?
-What do you mean?

11:13.833 --> 11:14.708
Death.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.541
Was he afraid of it? Intrigued by it? Or…

11:20.333 --> 11:21.416
He seemed fine.

11:23.791 --> 11:28.708
But that's what they say.
People who aren't okay, people who…

11:31.375 --> 11:33.708
They say that about people
who kill themselves.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.416
That they seemed fine.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.166
They do say that sometimes, yeah.

11:42.791 --> 11:44.333
[choir music playing]

11:51.958 --> 11:53.375
[inaudible conversation]

12:00.333 --> 12:01.500
[Ed sighs]

12:05.083 --> 12:08.375
-[sighs] I don't know what to do.
-He'll be here.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.125
-Boys.
-[Ooker] Father.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.375
[Warren] Feelin' better, Father?

12:19.458 --> 12:23.916
[sighs] Special night, boys.
Eyes up. Ears open.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.166
You know, I heard about it.

12:33.916 --> 12:37.166
I did. But seeing is believing, isn't it?

12:38.208 --> 12:41.708
Mildred Gunning, as I live and breathe.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.791
Beverly Keane.

12:45.666 --> 12:46.625
Oh.

12:47.916 --> 12:52.750
God gave you back to us.
And I am so glad that He did.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.625
And that you'll be with us
for what comes next.

12:57.458 --> 13:00.416
Well, thank you.
I'm very happy to be here.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.166
Not alone. Sarah Gunning.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.416
I'm so happy that you're here.
I can't possibly tell you.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.166
Thank you. Mom, let's get you inside
and get you off your feet.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.208
Of course.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
[Dolly] "They took the body of Jesus,

13:18.583 --> 13:22.166
and bound it with the burial cloths
along with the spices,

13:22.250 --> 13:24.458
according to the Jewish burial custom."

13:24.541 --> 13:26.708
"Now in the place
where he had been crucified,

13:26.791 --> 13:28.750
there was a garden, and in the garden,

13:28.833 --> 13:31.541
a new tomb in which
no one had yet been buried."

13:31.625 --> 13:35.583
"So, they laid Jesus there
because of the Jewish preparation day."

13:35.666 --> 13:37.666
"For the tomb was close by."

13:38.375 --> 13:41.750
-The Gospel of the Lord.
-[all] Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.375
[Father Paul clears throat]

13:51.375 --> 13:52.458
Good Friday.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.291
This is one of my favorite days
of the year. The passion of our Lord.

13:58.541 --> 14:00.583
Just that word, "passion."

14:01.166 --> 14:06.791
The word "passion," it means
a strong and barely controllable emotion.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.041
Barely controllable.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.958
That's what Jesus felt
when he gave his life for us,

14:12.041 --> 14:14.916
so that we might have life eternal.

14:15.625 --> 14:20.583
What a gift,
told so beautifully in the Gospel of John.

14:21.208 --> 14:27.250
"Gospel" means good news!
Good news on Good Friday.

14:27.958 --> 14:33.000
And yet, it's a story
of such profound suffering.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.375
What's so good about that?

14:35.458 --> 14:41.500
Jesus's suffering in this story,
it isn't simply necessary.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.041
It is good.

14:44.916 --> 14:47.375
It is the price of eternal life.

14:47.875 --> 14:51.458
That suffering, he endures alone.

14:51.541 --> 14:56.458
At the Resurrection, he is alone.
And then… Well…

14:57.625 --> 15:00.791
Ah, he has a few allies. And then more.

15:01.541 --> 15:02.666
A congregation.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.833
And then more and more people
spread that good news.

15:06.916 --> 15:11.666
Tell that good story.
And then, God has an army.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.208
What do they say in that commercial?

15:15.291 --> 15:17.666
Uh, "Be all that you can be."

15:17.750 --> 15:20.333
Well, I mean no offense
to the armed services,

15:20.416 --> 15:24.250
which are necessary
and of course honorable,

15:24.333 --> 15:27.208
but that's not all that you can be.

15:28.416 --> 15:31.166
In the Army,
you're fighting for God and country.

15:31.250 --> 15:35.083
Now, I am going to offend you now,
but it is the truth.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.666
God does not want you
to fight for this country.

15:40.208 --> 15:43.041
The arrogance… of that.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.208
God has no country.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.916
There is one God for the world.

15:50.791 --> 15:53.708
And the lines we draw,
and the treaties we draft,

15:53.791 --> 15:57.375
and the borders we close
mean nothing to Him.

15:57.458 --> 16:01.458
No, don't fight for a country.
You fight for God's kingdom.

16:02.125 --> 16:07.916
A kingdom which Jesus tells us
has no flags or borders.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.500
God's army. Now make no mistake.
It is a war. That's what an army is for.

16:15.166 --> 16:21.125
So, as a congregation, as God's army,
how do we know how the fight is going?

16:21.208 --> 16:24.833
We can't see it.
We can't radio HQ for a status report.

16:24.916 --> 16:29.458
All we have,
all God gives us, is right here.

16:30.166 --> 16:35.750
How we feel.
That moral compass inside each one of us

16:35.833 --> 16:38.833
pointing due north to the Holy Spirit.

16:38.916 --> 16:43.833
Conscience. In the army of God,
conscience is standard issue.

16:43.916 --> 16:47.666
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

16:48.958 --> 16:52.083
You may think that that's a line
from a war movie, but it isn't.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.416
That's actually the Rifleman's Creed.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.166
And a creed is, by definition,

16:57.250 --> 17:00.000
not just a belief,
but it is a religious one.

17:00.083 --> 17:04.750
So, it is a war,
and there will be casualties.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.125
And we must be soldiers.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.375
That is what Good Friday is about.

17:12.458 --> 17:17.208
God will ask
horrible things of you. Horrible.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.166
Just look at what He asked of His own son.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.958
Just look at what
Jesus had to endure today.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.208
We had to call it the "New Covenant,"

17:24.291 --> 17:28.250
because God's will,
while perfect, changes.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.375
God's will dictates morality,

17:30.458 --> 17:33.833
and as God's will changes,
so does morality change.

17:33.916 --> 17:37.083
It changed with the New Covenant.
It changed when Jesus came,

17:37.166 --> 17:41.458
and we must, as his army,
shed the Old Covenant

17:42.708 --> 17:43.916
and listen only to that.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.208
You rely on that compass.

17:47.958 --> 17:51.125
Good Friday is only good.

17:51.750 --> 17:57.541
The Gospel of the Lord,
so full of horror, is only good,

17:57.625 --> 18:00.250
because of where it is headed.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.166
The Resurrection.

18:02.250 --> 18:08.416
Today is only good because
of what's coming Easter, this Sunday.

18:08.500 --> 18:13.041
When Jesus is risen,
and death itself is lain dead.

18:14.583 --> 18:18.583
What is otherwise horrible is good
because of where it's headed.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.041
Welcome to God's army.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, we're gonna do great things.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.833
[Sarah] Mom. Mom, wait.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.083
What's wrong? Mom, stop.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.208
I don't want you
going back there ever again.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.250
What?

18:48.333 --> 18:52.833
That is not my church.
That is not the man I knew.

18:58.416 --> 18:59.583
[knocking at door]

19:10.750 --> 19:11.916
[knocking continues]

19:17.625 --> 19:20.833
Where the hell have you been?
I have been calling you all day.

19:20.916 --> 19:23.791
-I'm sorry.
-Don't do that. Where were you?

19:24.625 --> 19:25.458
Where were you?

19:28.291 --> 19:30.708
Do you remember
a few days before you left town,

19:31.750 --> 19:35.083
you crawled in my window,
woke me up, scared the shit out of me?

19:36.333 --> 19:37.833
You wanted to take a boat out?

19:37.916 --> 19:41.000
You wouldn't take no for an answer,
so we grabbed a rowboat and we rowed out

19:42.416 --> 19:46.166
far, smoked a pack of cigarettes
and watched the sun come up?

19:49.125 --> 19:50.708
Will you do that with me now?

19:52.583 --> 19:53.958
Can we go for a ride?

20:56.625 --> 20:58.875
You know, I'm pretty good about trust.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.875
Which is funny, considering my marriage.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.333
It was important to me
that I came out of that

21:06.041 --> 21:08.208
situation with trust in my heart.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.208
And I haven't pressed
because you never did.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.500
Not once. Not ever.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.708
You let me come to you.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.958
I'm trying to give that back.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.250
But here we are.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.916
And I've got to ask, you know.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.750
What's this about, Riley?

21:37.875 --> 21:39.791
It's where it all
came from in the first place.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.791
Stars.

21:42.916 --> 21:46.541
Primitive man, they were hunting
and gathering and stuff all day long,

21:46.625 --> 21:47.875
but at night they just

21:49.625 --> 21:55.416
sit around campfires tryin' to stay warm,
stay safe from predators.

21:56.375 --> 22:02.000
And they look out across the valleys,
and they see other campfires,

22:02.083 --> 22:07.250
just little spots of light
in the landscape,

22:07.333 --> 22:11.000
and they know that
other people are out there, in the dark.

22:12.375 --> 22:16.291
And then, they see
these spots of light in the sky.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.458
They don't know what they are.

22:18.541 --> 22:21.875
They don't have a clue about space
or stars or light waves.

22:21.958 --> 22:25.625
They just figure they look
a hell of a lot like campfires.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.250
"Who must those people be," they wonder.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.250
"Lightin' their campfires way up there?"

22:34.083 --> 22:36.208
They start telling each other stories.

22:36.833 --> 22:37.916
"Those people?"

22:39.833 --> 22:41.583
"They must be incredible."

22:42.500 --> 22:44.541
"Those campfires, they belong to people

22:44.625 --> 22:47.875
way more powerful
than we ever even imagined, so…"

22:50.333 --> 22:51.250
All of it.

22:52.916 --> 22:53.916
Every god.

22:55.833 --> 22:59.916
Every goddess, every religion,
every holy war. All of it.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.750
Started right up there.

23:05.458 --> 23:08.583
Just wondering who the hell
could've lit those campfires in the sky.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.416
I'm gonna tell you a story,
but you're not gonna believe it.

23:16.541 --> 23:19.333
I just need you to listen.
Can you promise me that?

23:21.166 --> 23:22.416
Yeah. I can.

23:24.666 --> 23:28.291
Okay.

23:32.458 --> 23:33.916
[cell phone vibrating]

23:50.125 --> 23:51.000
[Riley groans]

23:51.083 --> 23:54.375
[softly] Hey, hey.
You're okay. You're okay.

23:54.458 --> 23:59.791
Don't try to talk, you just relax,
here, focus on breathing, okay?

23:59.875 --> 24:01.541
[inhales and exhales sharply]

24:02.791 --> 24:04.000
-You're doing great.
-[Riley gasps]

24:04.083 --> 24:06.375
[Father Paul] No. Okay. Hey. You're fine.

24:06.458 --> 24:12.083
I… I had a sister.
Did I ever tell you that? Named Alice.

24:12.166 --> 24:16.750
She was older than me,
but she was much smaller.

24:16.833 --> 24:21.208
I was eight when she died. It was polio.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.958
It was awful to watch that.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.958
I was scared too, Riley.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.541
I was terrified of death,

24:28.625 --> 24:30.916
and that's actually
what brought me to God.

24:31.583 --> 24:35.166
Trying to understand how death,

24:35.250 --> 24:39.458
um, her death, specifically,
could be part of God's plan.

24:39.541 --> 24:42.958
That question, that brought me
all the way to the priesthood, actually…

24:43.041 --> 24:44.416
-[bones crunch]
-[Riley grunts]

24:45.625 --> 24:48.541
[shushes] Hey. You're okay.

24:49.666 --> 24:52.375
See, God still has a plan,

24:52.458 --> 24:55.666
and death isn't part of it anymore.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.083
Not for all of us.

24:58.541 --> 25:01.833
And we don't have to be afraid ever again.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.500
[Father Paul] How are you feeling?

25:31.166 --> 25:32.458
You look a lot better.

25:34.291 --> 25:35.875
Here, please, have a seat.

25:40.458 --> 25:42.666
No, I wouldn't do that.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.791
[Riley groans]

25:51.791 --> 25:52.833
I can, ah…

25:53.875 --> 25:57.541
Well, I can't exactly explain,
but I can give it a good try.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.541
The important thing is
not to go outside right now.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.583
I'm sorry, I was hoping to
warn you before. Well…

26:04.666 --> 26:08.166
[chuckles] It's not a mistake
you make twice, right?

26:10.041 --> 26:14.208
Don't worry, it took your neck
less than six hours to heal completely.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.375
Those burns will be no problem.
Here. Have a seat.

26:18.541 --> 26:22.250
I promise, I'll explain
everything that I can to you,

26:22.333 --> 26:24.416
and you will feel better when I do.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.458
Sit. Give your skin
a chance to heal, at the very least.

26:29.541 --> 26:30.833
We're having a meeting?

26:31.541 --> 26:32.916
We're having the meeting.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.625
I promise, it's okay.
You've had a long night, long journey.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.333
Sit.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.500
You'll be glad you did.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.916
-[inhales] Let's start with Serenity.
-Are you fucking kidding?

26:53.541 --> 26:55.708
Not at all. I am not.

26:55.791 --> 26:59.291
Today you get complete
and total honesty from me,

26:59.375 --> 27:04.958
and this prayer, today,
it applies to me and you, profoundly.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.666
Lord, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

27:10.750 --> 27:12.916
the courage to change the things I can,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.291
and the wisdom
to know the difference. Amen.

27:17.375 --> 27:19.875
Let's start in order.
The things we cannot change.

27:20.916 --> 27:24.125
When I was younger,

27:24.208 --> 27:28.666
I was a pastor at a small church
in a very small community.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.666
And one day this altar boy,

27:30.750 --> 27:34.916
he was a brand-new altar boy…
He was maybe nine or ten, smart kid.

27:35.458 --> 27:36.875
It's around Easter,

27:36.958 --> 27:40.375
so I'd been talking about the Resurrection
for a couple of weeks. Anyway.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.208
One day, this altar boy,
he brings me a shoebox.

27:44.333 --> 27:47.958
Inside this box, there's a mouse
that he's caught in a trap.

27:48.041 --> 27:52.000
It's in bad shape, the tail's
clipped off, leg barely attached.

27:52.083 --> 27:56.250
It's suffering.
And the boy hands me this box,

27:56.333 --> 27:58.250
and he asks me, you know,

27:59.083 --> 28:01.833
if God will resurrect it
like he resurrected Jesus.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.333
If he could do that, then he can do this.

28:05.416 --> 28:09.291
So I take this box, and we pray over it,

28:09.833 --> 28:13.458
and I send the boy home
and tell him to come back in three days.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.291
So three days pass,
the boy returns, and…

28:16.375 --> 28:17.958
And it was better.

28:18.041 --> 28:20.875
Yeah. It was runnin' around
that little box as right as rain.

28:20.958 --> 28:25.666
And I help the boy let the mouse go
behind the church before mass.

28:25.750 --> 28:26.750
He's amazed.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.791
His belief is confirmed. He believes.

28:30.666 --> 28:34.541
This moment, it sustained him for what?

28:35.916 --> 28:37.875
Almost a decade?

28:37.958 --> 28:40.208
Faith enough for almost a decade
off that one little mouse?

28:40.291 --> 28:41.875
That wasn't an act of God.

28:42.625 --> 28:43.708
Wasn't it?

28:44.291 --> 28:46.000
True, I had to
put the mouse out of its misery

28:46.083 --> 28:48.375
and true, it took me almost three days

28:48.458 --> 28:50.250
to find another mouse
that looked just like it,

28:50.333 --> 28:54.041
but what it gave this boy,
you think that wasn't an act of God?

28:54.125 --> 28:57.416
That because he's acting through us
at times, he isn't acting at all?

28:57.500 --> 28:58.875
How do you know that story?

29:01.041 --> 29:01.958
Who are you?

29:04.125 --> 29:05.375
You know who I am.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.791
Come on.

29:09.916 --> 29:10.958
Really look.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.708
Listen to yourself, you know who I am.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.541
Really? You need to see
the marks on my hands?

29:18.625 --> 29:21.333
-Put your hands into my side--
-That's not possible.

29:21.416 --> 29:23.083
Come on, we're past that now.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.666
"He said to Thomas,
'Put your fingers here,

29:25.750 --> 29:28.166
see my hands, reach out your hand,
put them into my side.'"

29:28.250 --> 29:31.708
-We're past that now. You're past that.
-Okay, then.

29:33.958 --> 29:34.833
Then how?

29:35.833 --> 29:39.416
Well, same as you, basically.

29:39.500 --> 29:43.416
You've been taken back as well,
taken back to your best self.

29:44.375 --> 29:47.583
Your peak self,
your perfect self as God wanted you.

29:47.666 --> 29:50.333
[chuckling] I just had a lot further
to go than you did.

29:50.416 --> 29:52.166
It was a lot further to go.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.375
Hey, why did you come back here?

29:56.041 --> 29:57.000
Last night.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.750
I've been wondering that
for most of… most of today.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.083
I've known you your whole life,

30:03.166 --> 30:06.541
never once have you
just shown up in the night,

30:06.625 --> 30:10.000
and then last night
at that specific moment, why?

30:10.916 --> 30:14.041
-Did you feel a calling? Vocation?
-[scoffs]

30:16.083 --> 30:17.708
Joe Collie's sister.

30:22.375 --> 30:25.791
I lied to you about that. I apologize.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.125
And I ask you
for your forgiveness for that lie.

30:32.625 --> 30:33.958
That's why you came back.

30:37.416 --> 30:40.958
Complete and total honesty.
That's my vow to you today.

30:41.041 --> 30:44.916
So, okay, Joe was suffering,
and he was suffering for no reason.

30:45.541 --> 30:49.833
The accident, then what the community
put him through, he was beyond repair--

30:49.916 --> 30:50.750
Says who?

30:50.833 --> 30:54.375
Well, it's a cliché to say that the Lord
works in mysterious ways, but he does.

30:54.458 --> 30:58.291
I can testify to that,
and, well, he worked through me.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.666
And Joe Collie was called home.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.583
-You killed him.
-It's not as simple as that.

31:02.666 --> 31:05.500
No. You fucking killed him.
You, and that thing.

31:05.583 --> 31:08.291
It cannot be changed.
It's done and cannot be undone,

31:08.375 --> 31:10.583
just like what's happened to you
cannot be undone.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.375
These are two things
that cannot be changed,

31:13.458 --> 31:16.791
and we must accept them
with serenity together right now.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.500
-What happened to me?!
-Riley--

31:18.583 --> 31:20.375
-What was that fucking thing?
-You have to calm down.

31:20.458 --> 31:23.666
-What the fuck was that thing?!
-An angel.

31:24.875 --> 31:25.916
[door opens]

31:26.000 --> 31:29.166
-Oh, good. He's up.
-[Father Paul] Little worse for wear.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.750
Well, you weren't exactly pink
in the cheeks yourself, Monsignor.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.000
Not at first.

31:34.625 --> 31:37.250
Uh, I just wanted to see
if everything was going to plan,

31:37.333 --> 31:38.875
and if you wanted Sturge to clean up--

31:38.958 --> 31:41.583
No, not yet.
We're still in the weeds of it. But…

31:43.250 --> 31:46.791
Uh, I'm glad you're here, Beverly.
Right when you're needed, God bless.

31:47.916 --> 31:51.291
Come over here. Please stand here. Stand…

31:51.375 --> 31:52.666
Stand right here.

31:53.291 --> 31:55.208
-Are you sure?
-[Father Paul] Yeah.

31:56.791 --> 31:57.958
Good and close.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.083
-Are you certain that's a good idea?
-Yeah. I'll stop him.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.333
-Stop me?
-All right then.

32:05.375 --> 32:08.125
-[Riley] Stop me from what?
-[Father Paul] Yeah. Okay.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.500
Look, just… Let me go.
I just wanna go home.

32:10.583 --> 32:13.875
-I just wanna fucking… go home.
-[Father Paul shushes]

32:13.958 --> 32:15.333
[heart beating faintly]

32:16.208 --> 32:17.583
[Father Paul] Right there, that's…

32:18.333 --> 32:19.583
You feel that, right?

32:20.500 --> 32:23.541
There it is. All right, a little closer.

32:24.875 --> 32:25.875
[heart beating louder]

32:25.958 --> 32:26.875
[Father Paul] Yeah.

32:28.375 --> 32:32.375
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Just a little bit closer. Don't worry.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.916
-[Riley] What the--
-It's okay. I got him.

32:36.875 --> 32:37.750
Okay.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.000
[heart beating loudly]

32:42.333 --> 32:43.250
[Father Paul] You feel that?

32:46.000 --> 32:46.916
Yeah.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.250
[Riley grunts]

32:54.083 --> 32:55.125
[Father Paul] That's all right.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.750
God and Heavenly Father,
grant us the serenity

32:57.833 --> 33:00.750
to accept that which we cannot change.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.541
-Thank you, Beverly.
-[Bev] Of course.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.791
Riley, I'm pleased
to see you up and around.

33:05.875 --> 33:06.708
[Father Paul] Okay. Yeah.

33:06.791 --> 33:09.250
Sturge and I will be in the rectory
when you're ready for the next part.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.375
Yeah, I'll draw back the curtain
when we're done.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.541
-[Riley grunts]
-[Father Paul shushes]

33:15.541 --> 33:16.500
Hey.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.708
It's powerful stuff, isn't it?

33:19.791 --> 33:20.875
[Riley groans]

33:23.791 --> 33:25.041
I'm sorry it hurts.

33:26.791 --> 33:27.666
I really am.

33:28.791 --> 33:31.833
But it… it will pass.

33:33.000 --> 33:33.875
It will pass.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.291
[Riley grunts]

33:37.041 --> 33:40.583
So, what did you feel
when she was close to you?

33:43.458 --> 33:45.666
I know the answer,
you don't have to pretend.

33:48.625 --> 33:51.875
You felt hungry. Painfully hungry.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.250
Saw things too.

33:55.333 --> 34:00.916
Saw yourself pull her closer, closer.
And everything went red, didn't it?

34:01.958 --> 34:04.041
Something started to change in you.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.625
It's almost like
you go to sleep, isn't it?

34:08.875 --> 34:11.833
I mean, you were aware of yourself
as you lunged at her.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.041
I don't know what happened.

34:13.125 --> 34:18.291
I do. You were aware of yourself,
but it was involuntary, wasn't it?

34:18.375 --> 34:22.541
It… It's as if your body
were acting under some other will. It was.

34:22.625 --> 34:26.083
It will again, and this is the thing.
This is where we need to listen.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.375
Listen to the Holy Spirit,
listen to our conscience.

34:29.958 --> 34:32.875
Because, you see, I was there, too.

34:32.958 --> 34:33.833
[hesitates]

34:34.541 --> 34:36.958
Well, I had been restored.

34:37.041 --> 34:40.791
I had been made young again.
I had been made pure again.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.041
And then, like Jesus before me, I died.

34:45.541 --> 34:50.833
I died on the floor,
just across the way there.

34:51.666 --> 34:55.666
And then I was resurrected,
but I was scared and confused,

34:55.750 --> 35:00.958
and this drive inside, this powerful will,

35:01.041 --> 35:04.250
and I felt the same way you did.

35:04.333 --> 35:07.750
My will became His will,
and He moved through me,

35:07.833 --> 35:12.416
and Joe was taken,
and I was sustained. I was nourished.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.708
-Murderer.
-Well, I suppose so, but here's the thing.

35:15.791 --> 35:18.500
I had no guilt. None.

35:19.125 --> 35:24.625
And knowing that I should feel guilt,
but accepting that I did not,

35:24.708 --> 35:29.541
finding grace where the guilt should be,
I wrestled with that.

35:29.625 --> 35:34.291
I prayed on it. But then Bev Keane,
actually, she showed me this.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.833
Hebrews 9:14.

35:36.916 --> 35:39.958
"How much more, then,
will the blood of Christ,

35:40.041 --> 35:43.666
who through the eternal spirit
offered himself unblemished to God,

35:43.750 --> 35:47.500
cleanse our consciences
from acts that lead to death

35:47.583 --> 35:50.708
so that we may serve the living God."

35:50.791 --> 35:54.250
"Cleanse our consciences
so that we may serve the living God."

35:54.333 --> 35:59.250
I read this passage and the graces
of the Holy Spirit rained down on me.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.458
He had taken that guilt.

36:01.541 --> 36:05.541
He cleansed my conscience,
for I had simply done His will.

36:05.625 --> 36:10.083
Been His vessel.
A murderer, maybe. So is Moses.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.500
Joseph. Paul, my namesake.

36:13.583 --> 36:15.708
I'm hardly unique
as a soldier of the Lord.

36:15.791 --> 36:21.416
I'm hardly unique in this room either.
Am I? I mean, you've killed someone.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.250
I don't remember it.

36:29.166 --> 36:31.000
You were drunk, and you don't remember.

36:31.750 --> 36:35.791
I was drunk. I was at a party,
it was a party, and I drank too much.

36:35.875 --> 36:38.500
-Yeah, come on. Don't do that.
-That's what happened.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.708
Well, there is meaning here.

36:40.791 --> 36:43.875
There is purpose here
that you are willfully ignoring.

36:43.958 --> 36:47.166
It was fucking ordinary what happened.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.875
There weren't even skid marks
on my side of the road.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.333
I never hit the brakes.

36:56.708 --> 36:57.583
[scoffs]

36:59.208 --> 37:01.041
I didn't even tap the brakes.

37:01.125 --> 37:05.416
I was literally asleep at the wheel.
That is what happened.

37:07.708 --> 37:12.000
So, don't talk to me about God
moving through you, or doing His will.

37:12.083 --> 37:15.583
You don't know a fucking thing about me.
And our stories are not the same.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.458
-The guilt you feel. The remorse--
-Yeah.

37:17.541 --> 37:19.000
-You feel that every day?
-Yes.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.958
-Even though you didn't mean to do it?
-Yes.

37:21.041 --> 37:26.250
See, I killed Joe. I watched myself do it
with my own hands, and I have no guilt.

37:26.333 --> 37:30.875
None. No remorse.
I have been spared all of that.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.916
-How does that make you feel?
-Disgusted.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.791
-How does it make you feel?
-Angry.

37:34.875 --> 37:37.041
-Nope. How does that make you feel?
-Fuckin' angry.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.125
No!

37:39.500 --> 37:42.458
I promised you complete honesty
and I'm giving that to you,

37:42.541 --> 37:45.666
and I'm tired of you
lying to me, Riley Flynn!

37:45.750 --> 37:49.291
I've forgiven it time and again,
but today is critical for us,

37:49.375 --> 37:54.166
and I am finished! Complete honesty!
How does it make you feel?!

38:00.583 --> 38:01.583
Jealous.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.958
God and Heavenly Father,

38:05.041 --> 38:08.041
grant us the serenity
to accept that which we cannot change,

38:08.125 --> 38:11.875
and the courage
to change that which we can.

38:11.958 --> 38:16.583
Courage, Riley Flynn. Courage.
Let's find that now. The courage.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.750
To change that, which we can.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.875
God brought you back. Okay? For a reason.

38:25.666 --> 38:27.625
Your accident,
that moment of hell on Earth,

38:27.708 --> 38:30.458
you say it didn't do
anyone any good, but it did, didn't it?

38:30.541 --> 38:32.458
Because it put you here
on this island right now,

38:32.541 --> 38:36.333
at one of the most crucial moments
in the history of our world.

38:37.208 --> 38:40.208
Have some courage. God chose you.

38:42.375 --> 38:45.208
And that guilt that you're clinging to,
you can let it go.

38:46.833 --> 38:52.791
God's changed you already.
Now it's just on you to have courage.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.333
So let's have some courage now. Okay?

38:58.458 --> 38:59.500
Courage.

39:02.750 --> 39:03.708
[exhales sharply]

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
I am sorry, by the way,
that you were frightened

39:10.000 --> 39:10.875
last night.

39:10.958 --> 39:13.833
I… I was frightened, too,
when it happened to me.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.541
Just about everyone,

39:15.625 --> 39:20.416
when they encounter an angel
in the Bible, they are frightened.

39:20.500 --> 39:26.000
Ah, Mary was afraid of Gabriel,
and he came to bring her great news.

39:28.541 --> 39:31.416
Angels always have to say,
"Be don't afraid, fear not,"

39:31.500 --> 39:34.833
because over and over and over again,

39:35.500 --> 39:37.666
people are terrified.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.791
Right? Moses was frightened
when he beheld the burning bush.

39:41.875 --> 39:44.916
Jesus was frightened of his own fate.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.083
He fell to his knees
in Gethsemane and prayed…

39:48.166 --> 39:50.250
He prayed to be spared.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.750
All the people at the tomb
when they rolled away the rock,

39:55.625 --> 39:56.666
they were all frightened.

39:56.750 --> 40:01.000
All of them. Miracles.
True power of the Lord.

40:02.416 --> 40:03.500
Scary.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.291
But still, I am sorry
that you were afraid.

40:08.041 --> 40:09.083
Did you feed?

40:11.041 --> 40:14.416
When that angel was ripping into my neck

40:14.500 --> 40:16.708
and my blood
was pouring out onto the floor.

40:16.791 --> 40:19.875
Did you… join in?

40:22.500 --> 40:24.125
Complete and total honesty, you said.

40:24.208 --> 40:25.083
Yes.

40:30.708 --> 40:34.583
How are things going in here?
I mean, I can only imagine.

40:35.458 --> 40:39.958
That's not exactly true.
I don't have to imagine, not all of it.

40:40.833 --> 40:41.666
I've seen it.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.916
Let me tell you, Monsignor was scared.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.375
We were all tested, but for some reason,
Riley Flynn, God has chosen you.

40:52.083 --> 40:55.833
You, to receive this blessing,
and we will not question His will.

40:55.916 --> 40:57.750
That's all that's important right now.

40:57.833 --> 41:03.041
You are being tested,
as he was, as we all were.

41:04.166 --> 41:05.458
And we are here for you.

41:06.333 --> 41:09.750
We are here for you,
for just as the body is one,

41:09.833 --> 41:13.083
and has many members
in all of the members of the body,

41:13.166 --> 41:15.958
though many are one. So is it with Christ.

41:16.666 --> 41:21.708
We are here to bless you.
To keep you. As is God's will.

41:21.791 --> 41:23.916
-God's will?
-Yeah.

41:25.875 --> 41:30.083
Yes. And don't mock, Riley.

41:30.750 --> 41:33.541
Do not mock God's will.

41:34.208 --> 41:36.166
We know it from His own word,
don't we, Sturge?

41:36.958 --> 41:38.291
[Sturge clears throat]

41:38.375 --> 41:43.125
"Whoever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has eternal life."

41:46.125 --> 41:52.125
-And?
-And, um… And "I will…" Um…

41:52.958 --> 41:55.083
"I will raise them up on the last day,

41:55.166 --> 41:58.625
for my flesh is real food,
and my blood is real drink."

41:58.708 --> 42:01.625
"And whomever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood

42:01.708 --> 42:04.416
will remain in me and I in them."
Gospel of John.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.250
And it's pretty specific, isn't it?

42:08.083 --> 42:10.625
I mean, he's not really
mincing words, is he?

42:10.708 --> 42:11.583
And this?

42:12.666 --> 42:13.833
Is this in the Gospel?

42:14.708 --> 42:15.750
[Bev] Why no, dear.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.000
That's Revelation.

42:18.625 --> 42:21.333
"The fourth Angel
poured his bowl upon the sun

42:21.416 --> 42:24.083
and it was allowed
to scorch men with fire."

42:24.166 --> 42:25.541
Chapter 16, verse 8.

42:25.625 --> 42:29.166
That is the thing
about Jesus coming back to us.

42:29.250 --> 42:32.083
They told us from the start
that it wouldn't be pretty.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.000
Monsignor Pruitt was shaken.

42:35.916 --> 42:36.916
Even him.

42:37.708 --> 42:38.833
But it is…

42:40.041 --> 42:42.791
It's all right there in the book, Riley.

42:42.875 --> 42:45.916
The seven bowls of God's wrath
poured out on the second coming.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.083
The end of days.

42:47.166 --> 42:50.458
The fourth bowl upon the sun,
the fifth bowl, since you asked,

42:50.541 --> 42:54.125
the fifth bowl of God's wrath
plunges the world into darkness,

42:54.208 --> 42:58.583
which won't be an issue for you.
Or for Monsignor. Will it?

42:59.541 --> 43:04.375
Why, it is almost as if
He is preparing you for that.

43:05.625 --> 43:10.833
You sit there, blessed among men,
smirking when I say "God's will."

43:10.916 --> 43:12.666
I… [sighs]

43:15.458 --> 43:16.583
I'm frustrated.

43:17.666 --> 43:18.625
I know.

43:18.708 --> 43:23.333
He doesn't even recognize what he
is being given, and I find it offensive.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.625
It's immaterial, Bev.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.250
I know.

43:28.958 --> 43:29.958
I know, okay.

43:32.125 --> 43:34.250
[Father Paul] "When supper was ended,
he took the cup."

43:34.333 --> 43:37.208
"Again, he gave you thanks and praise."

43:37.291 --> 43:39.708
"Gave the cup to his disciples and said,

43:40.583 --> 43:43.208
'Take this, all of you,
and drink from it.'

43:43.291 --> 43:46.833
'This is the cup of my blood, the blood
of the new, and everlasting covenant,

43:46.916 --> 43:51.500
shed for you and for all
so that sins may be forgiven.'

43:51.583 --> 43:54.666
'Do this in remembrance of me.'"

43:54.750 --> 43:55.625
Amen.

44:00.166 --> 44:02.583
-No, no, no.
-Don't be obtuse.

44:02.666 --> 44:05.083
"He who drinks from the cup of the Lord
in an unworthy manner

44:05.166 --> 44:08.166
is guilty of sinning against the body
and the blood of the Lord,

44:08.250 --> 44:11.958
for those who eat and drink
without discerning the body of Christ,

44:12.041 --> 44:14.833
eat and drink judgment upon themselves."

44:16.250 --> 44:18.458
[Father Paul] It's okay, Riley.
It's gonna happen.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.958
This is one of those things
that cannot be changed.

44:22.541 --> 44:26.666
Accept it, with serenity and grace.

44:33.291 --> 44:34.208
Amen.

44:43.625 --> 44:44.750
[Father Paul sighs]

44:45.958 --> 44:46.916
Wisdom.

44:47.500 --> 44:51.833
The wisdom to know the difference
between the things we can change,

44:51.916 --> 44:57.041
the things we can't,
and the things we shouldn't.

44:58.291 --> 45:00.333
How are you feeling?
You feel better, don't you?

45:03.041 --> 45:05.916
Wisdom. You and I,
Riley, we're just the first.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.333
We know, we've seen. We've been blessed.

45:08.416 --> 45:12.833
But so many others
on this island right now,

45:13.375 --> 45:15.000
they're being blessed as well,

45:15.083 --> 45:17.625
but they don't even know.
They don't even know it.

45:20.041 --> 45:24.208
It is good, what we're doing.
What we have to do. It's good.

45:25.750 --> 45:29.166
Even the things we may not
think we want to do. [hesitates]

45:30.041 --> 45:33.041
The hunger, that thirst is good.

45:33.125 --> 45:36.458
And that's why we don't feel guilt
when we surrender to it.

45:36.541 --> 45:43.041
That's why we feel better after.
And that's why we share this gift.

45:44.333 --> 45:45.458
Look at what it's done already.

45:46.208 --> 45:49.583
Just what a little of the blood
of the angel has done for all of us.

45:49.666 --> 45:54.125
For your parents, for Leeza,
for you, for so many in this community,

45:54.208 --> 45:57.458
look at the good it has wrought.
Look on that.

45:57.541 --> 45:59.958
Think on that warm feeling
you have here right now.

46:00.041 --> 46:04.250
Think on that and just answer me this.
Do you feel at peace?

46:05.500 --> 46:06.750
Your stomach full?

46:07.375 --> 46:09.166
Your purpose clear?

46:09.250 --> 46:15.125
Your will given over to a higher power?
Do you feel at peace?

46:27.125 --> 46:28.916
Praise be. Praise be.

46:29.583 --> 46:30.583
"And the peace of God,

46:30.666 --> 46:34.833
which transcends all understanding
will guard your hearts and your minds."

46:35.583 --> 46:37.000
Bless you, my boy.

46:40.500 --> 46:41.875
You always were blessed.

46:44.125 --> 46:47.083
So smart. And you always listened.

46:47.166 --> 46:50.583
Thank you for listening today
when it's never been so important.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.625
[door opens]

46:54.208 --> 46:56.250
-I'm sorry to interrupt.
-[Father Paul] That's quite all right.

46:56.333 --> 46:58.875
[Bev] The sun is down.
People will start arriving soon.

46:58.958 --> 47:01.750
[sighs] Excellent. Well…

47:03.750 --> 47:05.041
I believe that's it.

47:06.208 --> 47:07.083
That's it?

47:07.875 --> 47:12.208
-[Father Paul] Yeah. That's the meeting.
-What happens now?

47:12.291 --> 47:14.958
-Now you can go.
-[Riley] Just like that?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.791
[Father Paul chuckling] Just like that.

47:18.916 --> 47:21.583
The wonders that
you will experience out there,

47:21.666 --> 47:25.166
you'll see things you never saw before.

47:25.875 --> 47:28.916
Colors, lights.
You'll hear things, smell things.

47:29.500 --> 47:32.666
The world, it burns brighter.

47:33.416 --> 47:38.708
It hums, Riley,
with His glory. You'll see.

47:39.291 --> 47:42.375
Monsignor, I thought we agreed,
he should stay inside the rec center--

47:42.458 --> 47:44.375
[Father Paul] It's all right, Beverly.

47:44.458 --> 47:47.125
Not everyone is ready
for the Lord's revelation, Riley.

47:47.708 --> 47:50.541
Jesus took care to show them enough,
but not too much.

47:50.625 --> 47:53.625
-Beverly and Sturge, Wade and Dolly--
-The mayor?

47:53.708 --> 47:57.708
That's right. They've been blessed
as well, chosen as well.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.458
They think you should be
made to stay here, but I think no.

48:00.541 --> 48:06.458
I think free will. That's the ball game,
wasn't it? That is the whole thing.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.708
I have faith in you.

48:09.541 --> 48:14.708
In their hearts, humans plan their course,
but the Lord establishes their steps.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.708
I hope you come to mass tonight.
Please, come to mass.

48:21.791 --> 48:23.125
Come to be with us.

48:23.208 --> 48:25.458
Come be with your family,
of which we all are.

48:25.541 --> 48:29.750
Your redemption, Riley, it's profound.

48:30.416 --> 48:33.458
It'd be an inspiration to all of us,
to so many in those pews

48:33.541 --> 48:37.083
who will struggle with the same fears
that you've struggled with.

48:37.166 --> 48:39.833
Are you certain
it isn't best he just stay here?

48:39.916 --> 48:40.958
You know now, son.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.750
[Bev] Maybe just for another night or two.

48:43.916 --> 48:46.791
You are the bearer of the good news,
and think on this.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.708
That hunger will return when God wills it,

48:50.791 --> 48:54.458
and shortly after,
you will give yourself over to it,

48:54.541 --> 48:57.458
to His will,
and you will hear it in your head,

48:57.541 --> 49:00.791
the voice of His angel,
like your own thoughts at first,

49:00.875 --> 49:03.875
but then louder and louder.
And he will whisper to you of God's plan.

49:03.958 --> 49:08.125
I hear him more clearly every day.
The more I give myself over to God,

49:08.208 --> 49:11.708
the more I hear the voice
of His angel and you will, too.

49:11.791 --> 49:13.541
That's okay, that's good.

49:13.625 --> 49:15.375
Know you will be moved to act

49:15.458 --> 49:17.875
and there will be
things you cannot change.

49:22.875 --> 49:25.666
But whoever you choose
to enter communion with,

49:25.750 --> 49:28.500
whoever serves God's purpose for you,

49:29.500 --> 49:31.666
as you give of yourself for them to drink,

49:32.375 --> 49:35.666
as they eat of your body
and drink of your blood and you of theirs,

49:36.750 --> 49:40.625
and you are
in the communion of saints, remember…

49:42.958 --> 49:44.583
that it's a gift.

49:46.791 --> 49:48.916
And God will tell you
who to share it with.

50:06.875 --> 50:11.375
I worry. I worry about that one.
He's hardly the reliable sort.

50:12.166 --> 50:15.125
[Father Paul] Well, God chooses
his vessels, Beverly.

50:15.208 --> 50:16.625
[Bev] What if he tells people?

50:16.708 --> 50:19.875
What of it? That's what apostles are for.

50:20.833 --> 50:23.791
The doors stay open
as the gates are always open.

50:25.166 --> 50:26.708
How else does gospel spread?

50:47.916 --> 50:49.375
[inaudible conversation]

51:28.333 --> 51:31.916
[Father Paul] What is otherwise horrible
is good because of where it's headed.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.875
Welcome to God's army.

51:36.125 --> 51:37.958
Yeah, we're gonna do great things.

51:45.625 --> 51:48.458
[Sarah] Mom. Mom, wait.

51:49.125 --> 51:51.958
What's wrong? Mom, stop.

51:53.666 --> 51:56.958
[Mildred] I don't want you
going back there ever again.

51:57.041 --> 51:58.208
[Sarah] What?

51:58.291 --> 52:02.666
[Mildred] That is not my church.
That is not the man I knew.

52:22.750 --> 52:24.250
[groans softly]

52:53.166 --> 52:55.166
[hearts beating]

53:27.666 --> 53:28.958
[Erin] That's quite a story.

53:30.666 --> 53:37.375
And let's just say
that any of that is true.

53:39.541 --> 53:40.458
[Riley] Let's.

53:44.083 --> 53:47.125
So, you've told me that story, you…

53:51.916 --> 53:53.708
brought me out here, you…

53:55.333 --> 54:01.916
have brought us out here
where there is nowhere for me to go.

54:07.041 --> 54:07.916
Because?

54:08.000 --> 54:09.125
[heart beating]

54:10.875 --> 54:13.958
I mean, you brought me out here

54:14.041 --> 54:17.541
where there is nowhere
for me to go, to what, exactly?

54:21.541 --> 54:23.208
To tell me you need help?

54:25.958 --> 54:26.958
To scare me?

54:28.625 --> 54:32.083
See, I can't believe… I can't believe
you'd want to scare me.

54:33.291 --> 54:34.458
I don't believe that.

54:37.166 --> 54:39.041
And even if you did, well…

54:41.333 --> 54:45.166
I've been scared much worse
by much worse, and I don't…

54:47.125 --> 54:49.000
I don't let that happen anymore.

54:52.791 --> 54:53.833
I'm not scared.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.416
Not of you.

55:02.250 --> 55:05.125
My dear, dear you.

55:06.958 --> 55:12.083
If you are sick or if you need help,
I'm not scared of that.

55:14.208 --> 55:15.541
I'd get you the help you need.

55:15.625 --> 55:18.833
I'd do that with you,
without judgment and without fear.

55:23.916 --> 55:26.375
Just tell me what you need.

55:30.041 --> 55:32.041
Tell me why we're out here.

55:34.791 --> 55:36.041
Tell me what you want.

55:40.916 --> 55:41.750
You weren't…

55:44.666 --> 55:48.041
quite right, what you said
about why I brought us out here. I didn't…

55:50.250 --> 55:53.000
bring you out here
to scare you or to isolate you.

56:00.291 --> 56:02.541
I brought you out here
so I'd have nowhere to go.

56:08.708 --> 56:10.041
I'm not as strong as you.

56:12.041 --> 56:13.125
I never was.

56:17.916 --> 56:18.958
[inhales]

56:26.875 --> 56:28.000
What do I want?

56:30.666 --> 56:32.958
I want you to take this boat
and row to the mainland

56:33.041 --> 56:35.000
and leave this place and never look back.

56:37.583 --> 56:39.250
But I knew you wouldn't do that.

56:41.208 --> 56:43.708
I knew you wouldn't believe
any of this unless you saw.

56:46.500 --> 56:49.375
I want you… to run.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.916
But I believe you're gonna row back there

56:53.000 --> 56:54.916
and do everything
you can to try and save them.

56:57.833 --> 56:59.833
I'm just so sorry you have to see this.

57:05.750 --> 57:07.000
I love you, Erin Greene.

57:10.375 --> 57:11.833
I've loved you my whole life.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.166
One way or another.

57:20.625 --> 57:21.916
I love you, too.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.083
I did my best.

57:30.833 --> 57:31.750
[sniffles]

57:35.458 --> 57:36.666
I did my best.

58:12.416 --> 58:14.125
[screams]

58:27.625 --> 58:28.958
[sobbing]
