00:01.718 --> 00:03.429
- Stop!
- You didn't belong with those people.

00:03.430 --> 00:04.734
You belong with me.

00:06.208 --> 00:09.277
You are a sick, delusional felon.

00:10.285 --> 00:11.335

00:15.924 --> 00:17.675
Don't give up on me, okay?

00:17.676 --> 00:19.627
I'm learning how to forgive.

00:19.628 --> 00:20.628
- Surprise.
- Crash!

00:20.629 --> 00:22.129
I'm so happy to see you.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.488
(Crash) Next I'll find
out where I'm posted.

00:23.489 --> 00:25.299
What if you get stationed on
the other side of the world?

00:25.300 --> 00:26.634
We'll deal with that when it happens.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.885
Lori's going on trial.

00:27.886 --> 00:29.637
She could be released immediately.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.105
(lawyer) What did you say
to her, the defendant,

00:31.106 --> 00:32.473
in the hospital when she was ill?

00:32.473 --> 00:34.308
I love you.

00:34.309 --> 00:35.643
Tell me you love me more.

00:35.644 --> 00:38.979
Was this woman, in fact,
your mother or not?

00:38.980 --> 00:39.980
Maybe. (sniffles)

00:39.981 --> 00:42.116
I call to the stand Benjamin Wallace.

00:42.117 --> 00:42.929
Who is he?

00:42.930 --> 00:44.547
(Liz) They added him, at the last minute.

00:44.548 --> 00:47.383
Lori Stevens is my biological mother.

00:47.384 --> 00:49.634

Lori! What the hell are you doing here!

03:40.864 --> 03:42.115

03:42.116 --> 03:43.666

03:54.378 --> 03:56.244
We've been looking for you.

03:57.214 --> 03:59.297
And, here I am.

04:01.218 --> 04:02.935
Oka... I asked you what
you were doing here.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.854
We're living here.

04:04.855 --> 04:06.722
This is our district.

04:06.723 --> 04:08.474
You moved here?

04:08.475 --> 04:09.776
Hey, uh, we should do this.

04:09.777 --> 04:11.977
They can't give me my
classes until you sign.

04:13.113 --> 04:15.865
Look, Carter, you don't
need to worry about me

04:15.866 --> 04:17.233
interfering in your life.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.402
I understand how you feel about me,

04:19.403 --> 04:20.870
and I'm gonna stay away.

04:20.870 --> 04:23.406
But I just want you to
know that I love you,

04:23.407 --> 04:25.074

04:25.075 --> 04:27.575

04:28.745 --> 04:30.612
Don't worry, I won't.

04:38.639 --> 04:41.140
Do you think we need to
get a restraining order?

04:41.141 --> 04:42.675
That's not a bad idea, actually.

04:42.676 --> 04:44.427
Liz, she has my son.

04:44.428 --> 04:45.761
I know, David.

04:45.762 --> 04:48.397
I'm trying really hard
to be okay with that.

04:48.398 --> 04:50.850
She did promise she was gonna stay away,

04:50.851 --> 04:52.101
if that's worth anything.

04:52.102 --> 04:53.986
- How about, nothing?
- Less than nothing.

04:53.987 --> 04:56.471
(Liz) Okay, what are we gonna do?

04:57.741 --> 04:58.941
I don't know.

04:58.942 --> 05:00.459
I'm just... I'm trying to take it all in.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.426
Well, I know one thing...

05:01.427 --> 05:02.612
I don't want her near my family.

05:02.613 --> 05:03.830
Neither do I, obviously,

05:03.831 --> 05:05.281
but we have to handle it the right way.

05:05.282 --> 05:07.333
But she's already shown
up at the girls' school.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.752
The... the woman, she doesn't understand

05:09.753 --> 05:12.088
the word, "boundaries."

05:12.089 --> 05:14.123
We need to get the authorities involved.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.075
Oh. At the expense of someone

19:29.076 --> 19:30.876
you also claim is your kid?

19:30.877 --> 19:32.128
She is my kid.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.746
I think the courts established that.

19:33.747 --> 19:34.880
Lori, you have no authority

19:34.881 --> 19:36.082
to write a book about Carter,

19:36.083 --> 19:38.084
- or about any of us.
- Actually, I do.

19:38.085 --> 19:39.251
Not that it's any of your business.

19:39.252 --> 19:40.386
It is my business

19:40.387 --> 19:43.089
because Carter, she's my daughter,

19:43.090 --> 19:44.590
and it affects her.

19:44.591 --> 19:46.726
Just one of the many
lessons of motherhood

19:46.727 --> 19:49.011
- that you never learned.
- I'm not gonna stand here

19:49.012 --> 19:51.097

19:51.098 --> 19:52.964
Fine. Fine.

19:54.768 --> 19:57.937
I just... I just need to remind you that...

19:57.938 --> 20:00.106
Carter, she already despises you.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.857
So, if you write this book, any chance

20:01.858 --> 20:03.275
you ever had of having any kind

20:03.276 --> 20:05.745
of relationship with her is over.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.029
You can count on that.

20:07.030 --> 20:09.331
So, if you claim to love her,

20:09.332 --> 20:11.500
you'll drop the whole thing.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.652

You're drunk yourself.
You've been drinking all night.

33:33.323 --> 33:35.157
(Max) You know, I think both of you

33:35.158 --> 33:36.708
are probably a little inebriated, so...

33:36.709 --> 33:38.460
At least I know when to stop.

I can't, it's a school night.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.057
Oh, where do you go?

33:57.944 --> 34:01.162
Um... uh, Reston Community College.

34:01.163 --> 34:02.197
Why, is that where you go?

34:02.198 --> 34:04.282
Me? No.

34:04.283 --> 34:07.779
When I was 16, I got up and walked
out, and never looked back.

34:08.257 --> 34:09.975
- Do you regret it?
- No.

34:09.976 --> 34:11.226
Not at all.

34:11.226 --> 34:12.594
You know, once I left
my life got started.

34:12.594 --> 34:15.898
Did some traveling and
started working here.

34:15.899 --> 34:17.399
Sounds cool.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.849
All you gotta do is choose it.

34:19.569 --> 34:20.819
Jerry, I need two mojitos.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.969
Yup.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.940
I think I'm getting you in trouble.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.159
You can't. I run the place.

34:27.159 --> 34:28.360
But one of our servers quit,

34:28.360 --> 34:30.362
so I am stuck doing double duty

34:30.362 --> 34:32.282
until I find someone to replace her.

34:39.205 --> 34:40.539
Hey.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.989
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:43.877 --> 34:45.960
What are you doing?

34:45.962 --> 34:48.130
Texting.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.547
What's she doing?

34:51.467 --> 34:53.501
(sighs) Not very much.

35:02.562 --> 35:04.011
Texting Ofe?

35:05.148 --> 35:08.066
He's bummed he's not at my party.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.850

35:10.870 --> 35:13.322
I miss him.

35:13.323 --> 35:14.957
Me, too.

35:14.958 --> 35:18.159
But, uh, rehab's the best
place for him right now.

35:19.913 --> 35:21.163
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

35:21.164 --> 35:24.833

35:24.834 --> 35:26.919

35:26.920 --> 35:28.536
But you're also right.

35:30.507 --> 35:32.540
I'm not doing so great.

35:33.226 --> 35:35.427
Gabe, I...

35:35.428 --> 35:38.730
I hate seeing you like this.

35:38.731 --> 35:40.014
What can I do?

35:41.484 --> 35:43.517
I don't know.

35:44.904 --> 35:47.722
But, I like that you're
worried about me.

35:59.085 --> 36:03.255

Lori backed out.

36:12.298 --> 36:15.133
She's not writing the book.

36:15.134 --> 36:17.718
Wonder what made her change her mind.

36:19.439 --> 36:21.390
(softly) I met him.

36:21.391 --> 36:23.942
Carter brought him over.

36:23.943 --> 36:25.593
Did you talk to him?

36:27.113 --> 36:28.113
A little.

36:28.114 --> 36:30.232
- And?
- He has my eyes.

36:30.233 --> 36:31.599
(chuckles)

36:33.453 --> 36:34.903

Of all the horrible, sick
things Lori has done,

36:41.077 --> 36:44.995
bringing that kid into the
world is not one of them.

36:47.584 --> 36:49.917
I want to do what I can for him.

36:51.721 --> 36:54.121
