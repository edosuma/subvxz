WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.559
Are you insinuating that I,

00:02.560 --> 00:04.599
as a chairman
of a successful company,

00:04.600 --> 00:07.799
am involved in football match fixing?

00:07.800 --> 00:10.639
That man, the witness,
he's my father.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.639
Graham King,
chairman of Pax Car Rentals?

00:13.640 --> 00:17.111
I didn't know what he does,
where he works. We're not close.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.360
Get the fuck off me!
Let me go!

00:30.320 --> 00:32.159
The deceased's blood results present
a platelet count

00:32.159 --> 00:33.999
substantially below normal range.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.719
Bleeding to death
by cerebral haemorrhage.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.799
Why would Tyler's blood
have low platelets?

00:37.800 --> 00:39.079
Come back!

00:39.080 --> 00:41.159
If you hadn't been flashing
your tits all over the internet,

00:41.160 --> 00:42.359
none of this would have happened!

00:42.360 --> 00:43.839
We have a few questions
about your son.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.959
This isn't a good time.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.479
Tyler's death's
been upsetting enough.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.439
You coming around, implying he was
some kind of drug cheat.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.079
It's Shannon Hinksman.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.559
We saw him hanging out with
the Firecrackers in Melbourne.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.759
He's got form - for assault,
and dealing, and standover.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.120
Rich, I'll call you back, mate.
See ya.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.358
That wasn't Clay's phone.
We need a tower dump.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.479
Actually, fuck it.
I'll tell them everything.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.839
I'll bring you all down with me.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.119
Careful, Clay.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.160
You do that, mate -
we're gonna kill your son.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.960
That look he gave me.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.003
He was telling me it was murder.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:35.685 --> 01:42.974
3x03

01:44.040 --> 01:46.079
Having consulted
the investigating officer,

01:46.080 --> 01:47.479
and in light of new evidence,

01:47.480 --> 01:49.959
the charge of reckless driving
against the driver of the bus

01:49.960 --> 01:51.799
which fatally struck Clay Nelson
cannot be sustained.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.879
What new evidence?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.279
What have the police found?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.679
Unfortunately,
I'm not at liberty to say.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.039
Doesn't the public have
a right to know?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.599
There are bigger issues at play here
which I'm unable to discuss.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.639
How do they feel about
not seeing justice done?

02:01.640 --> 02:03.559
I can assure you we have
informed them of our decision

02:03.560 --> 02:04.919
and they understand the situation.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.332
He'd be hating this.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.959
I'll say again, this decision takes
into account the opinion

02:09.960 --> 02:11.725
of the investigating officers.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.471
What would you have done?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.104
If you were Clay,
with the choice he had to make?

02:20.480 --> 02:22.239
Well, if it meant saving
my children,

02:22.240 --> 02:24.639
and there was no other way,
the same, no question.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.759
You wouldn't slip me
a coded message first?

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
Clay did.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.118
He waited until he knew
I'd seen him.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.890
And that look in his eyes.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.440
It was a man with no choice.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.479
Janet must have loved every moment

02:42.480 --> 02:44.519
of watching me eat
her dog-shit sandwich.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.479
I assessed the new evidence
as presented to me.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.719
I just can't share it with you.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.479
Because it came
from the star chamber,

02:49.480 --> 02:51.199
which makes you her errand boy.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.599
You could have ignored
my determination

02:52.600 --> 02:54.836
and run it as
an ex-officio indictment.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.319
You know I wouldn't have recommended
withdrawing the charge

02:57.320 --> 02:58.599
without good reason.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.799
You tell Janet
I know exactly what this is about,

03:00.800 --> 03:04.565
and if this is the way she wants to
play it, let the games begin.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.879
So the man who incited
Clay Nelson's suicide,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.799
he talks about the boss.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.079
We heard his phone ring.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.679
Whoever made that call could
well be the major profit-taker.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.359
So what did we get
from the tower dump?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.280
Janet, your office.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.080
Sure.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.519
What is it?

03:29.520 --> 03:30.959
The tower dump
identified the phone

03:30.960 --> 03:32.879
belonged to Clay's mystery visitor,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.519
and the man who called him.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.959
Great. Who are they?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.559
Mystery man's phone was a burner.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.879
Registered to a false identity.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.359
But the phone that called him
belongs to your father,

03:42.360 --> 03:45.184
which now makes him
our major person of interest.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.239
Last month, he made several calls

03:52.240 --> 03:54.879
to Nate Baldwin, Darren Faulkes
and Wazim Jandaphur.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.159
They are all connected in some way
to the betting syndicate.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.799
OK, and if we discover stronger
evidence connecting him to that,

04:00.800 --> 04:01.919
we'll get him back in.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.119
You mean I will.
Of course.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.599
I mean, I'll step back from any
investigation concerning him.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.959
I reiterate, you cannot be involved
in any proceedings

04:09.960 --> 04:12.559
in which your name
and his appears in a transcript,

04:12.560 --> 04:13.639
which might turn up in court,

04:13.640 --> 04:15.159
or where you would be called
as a witness.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.599
I can still focus
on other persons of interest.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.199
I can still work this reference...

04:19.200 --> 04:21.798
I know...
..behind an ethical wall.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.199
I know how much you value
your professional integrity,

04:24.200 --> 04:26.479
and I trust you
to stand by those principles.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.039
But under no circumstances

04:28.040 --> 04:30.679
are you to discuss anything about
this reference with him.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.000
Of course. I...

04:32.880 --> 04:35.759
Even better, don't see him at all
until this is over.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.320
Build that ethical wall very high
and stay right behind it.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.400
Concentrate on how Shannon Hinksman
fits into this.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.559
You'd think for someone
with drug and standover form,

05:03.560 --> 05:06.160
you'd get a bit more bang
for your buck.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.839
Shops, strip club, home.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.959
Maybe Hinksman's finally
gone straighty-180.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.759
He's been hanging out with
the Firecrackers.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.643
He's a known bagman for...
Yeah, hang on, hang on.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.240
He just met someone.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.000
Come on, sweetheart. Turn around.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.319
Attaboy.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.639
That's Eddie Cooke
from Continuum Therapy.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.520
What's he doing with Hinksman?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.399
What are they meeting about?

05:40.400 --> 05:41.930
Lover's tiff by the looks.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.879
Eddie's left something.
Shannon's got it.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.559
Right - stay on Shannon.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.519
Can you keep me posted? I'm going to
Nate Baldwin's committal.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.079
Why bother? It'll just be Richard
Stirling trashing the police case.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.599
Or proving his own.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.159
If he found the substance Tyler took,
to break causation for Nate,

06:06.160 --> 06:07.559
I need to know where it came from.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.502
It could lead us to whoever set up
the betting plunge on the Devils.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.200
Excuse me, mate.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.999
Anything to say
to your teammate?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.919
Can you comment
on today's proceedings?

06:52.920 --> 06:54.391
Nate! Nate!

07:08.520 --> 07:10.119
Will Nate Baldwin's
manslaughter charge

07:10.120 --> 07:11.559
affect your sponsorship
of the Devils?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.919
Are rumours true
you're severing ties with them?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.639
Pairing with a club
is like a marriage.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.399
You're in it
for the good times and the bad.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.399
I have every faith that Nate Baldwin
will be found not guilty,

07:20.400 --> 07:22.399
and I look forward to him returning
to what he does best -

07:22.400 --> 07:24.280
superb football.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.879
So according
to the two witness statements,

07:43.880 --> 07:47.879
one saw the accused hit the deceased
with his right hand,

07:47.880 --> 07:49.586
the other with his left hand.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.639
Would you agree,
Detective Sergeant Renner,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.111
that these are
contradictory recollections?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.439
Well in the heat of the moment,

07:57.440 --> 07:59.999
everyone sees things
slightly differently.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.360
Slightly differently?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.799
Wouldn't you really say
that these statements

08:04.800 --> 08:07.319
are two irreconcilable versions of
the same incident?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.719
I object, Your Honour.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.319
The question calls for a conclusion,
which is a matter for the court.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.079
Your Honour, Sergeant Renner
is not a lay witness.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.559
His opinion is admissible.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.999
Your Honour, both statements

08:17.000 --> 08:19.919
describe a violent attack
on Mr Perati by the accused.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.679
That is an agreed fact.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.039
Just because my learned colleague
found some minor inconsistencies,

08:26.040 --> 08:28.799
which Sergeant Renner
has confirmed...

08:28.800 --> 08:30.799
Your Honour, the Crown
simply does not wish to hear

08:30.800 --> 08:32.879
that what they refer
to as minor inconsistencies

08:32.880 --> 08:35.399
are, in fact, major contradictions.
I wonder why.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.558
All we're saying is that if
he wishes to make that argument,

08:37.559 --> 08:39.399
he needs to make it to the court.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.239
It's not a matter on which Sergeant
Renner's opinion is relevant.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.240
Agreed.
Thank you, Madam Crown.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.559
While the defence has highlighted
conflicting evidence

08:49.560 --> 08:51.719
among the witness statements,

08:51.720 --> 08:56.199
but that is for a properly
instructed jury to resolve.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.399
I find there is a reasonable prospect
of conviction,

08:59.400 --> 09:02.599
and commit Nathaniel Baldwin
to trial for manslaughter.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.119
Date to be set
at a mention on Friday.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.415
- As the court pleases.
- All rise.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.599
Nate, do you still
maintain your innocence?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.639
How do you feel
about your husband facing jail?

09:11.640 --> 09:14.399
What does this mean
for your career prospects, Nate?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.879
Hey, well done.
You did a good job.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.719
Thanks.
It's a shame you can't run the trial.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.319
Lucky she's not,
or you'd be losing again.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.439
I had this crazy idea
I'd sit the bar exam

09:21.440 --> 09:22.599
when I was on maternity leave,

09:22.600 --> 09:25.719
but my adorable two-year-old
superior had other ideas.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.956
Well, I know
what I'd prefer right now.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.229
I take it you've got Nate in
your sights for match fixing too.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.039
Bizarre it's taken this
to get us together again.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.159
Aren't Christmases
and birthdays for that?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.720
In some families.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.279
I do send cards.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.398
Yes, your secretary's
very efficient.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.716
Well, whatever the reason,
it's great to be talking now.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.680
You still haven't arranged
for me to meet the twins.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.457
I'd love to get
to know them properly.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I mean, what are they into?
What do they like doing?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.640
Well, they're very keen
on athletics.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.679
You'll be happy to know that Emma's
got the zone trials this Thursday,

10:34.680 --> 10:37.199
and Liam would have been there,
but he hurt his ankle, so...

10:37.200 --> 10:39.083
Sports stars in the making?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.299
Well they didn't get that from you.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.680
I'm free to meet them...

10:46.760 --> 10:48.231
...whenever it suits you.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.679
Are you sure you've got the time?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.799
I mean, you must be dealing
with a lot these days.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.560
For my grandchildren,
I'll make the time.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.400
Call me.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.000
You've got my number.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.800
The NCC must be looking
at my phone records.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.800
I can't tell you that.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.479
You!

11:46.480 --> 11:49.359
You bloody told me
you'd get the charges thrown out!

11:49.360 --> 11:51.039
Actually, my precise words were,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.079
"I will do my best
to have them thrown out."

11:53.080 --> 11:55.919
And I could do much better if I had
your full and frank cooperation.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Rhys
and Dale told you what they saw.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.519
I'm talking about
whatever drug Tyler was taking.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.679
If we can show that
changed his blood profile,

12:03.680 --> 12:06.399
and he died because of that change,
then we win.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.999
Our supplements are above board.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.199
You have all the paperwork
from Eddie Cooke.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.318
I mean, we never failed a drug test.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.319
Say we knew he had taken something,
hypothetically.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.556
What would that mean?

12:20.680 --> 12:23.679
Look, there's no point
talking what ifs.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.679
If Tyler took something
outside of our program,

12:25.680 --> 12:27.039
we knew nothing about it.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.200
OK. Well, maybe his family does.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.679
He's obviously close
with his sister.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.679
Have you spoken to her?

12:32.680 --> 12:34.440
After this, not a chance.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.671
Oi! That was mine, you prick.
Give it back!

12:45.280 --> 12:46.400
Fuck!

12:47.440 --> 12:48.839
What are you looking at?

12:48.840 --> 12:51.119
Youth Services said
I could get a bed here.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.599
Good luck finding one.
The lady said there would be.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.119
I've got all the forms I need.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.826
Like that makes a difference.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.159
Come on. I'll find you somewhere.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.960
Cindi.
Pearl.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.080
Guys, this is Pearl.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.840
It stinks.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.320
This can be yours.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.671
Just keep your stuff
with you at all times.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.309
Even when you chuck a piss.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.535
You stay out of their way,
and they'll stay out of yours.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.439
The drug results are in

14:33.440 --> 14:36.039
from Wayne busting that deal
earlier - the one Shannon sold.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.839
The lab's confirmed
that they're steroids,

14:37.840 --> 14:40.239
so not a match
for whatever Tyler Perati took.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.439
But it does make you wonder about
Eddie's supplement program

14:42.440 --> 14:43.439
for the Devils.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.499
I mean, he's hardly
all above board.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.880
He wants to play warm doting grandpa.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.719
Graham was
at Nate Baldwin's committal.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.640
We didn't discuss
the reference.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.130
He saw me
and wanted to talk about the kids.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.079
Twenty years,
almost no contact,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.845
and he acts like he's been away
for the weekend.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.102
Technically, you shouldn't have
even spoken to him.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.279
I just had to see if the man
standing in front of me

15:20.280 --> 15:23.240
was capable
of ordering somebody's death.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.720
And?

15:31.600 --> 15:33.119
I thought I knew him.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.000
Well, until he left.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.560
Maybe I didn't.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.949
And maybe I should take you home
and pour you a glass of wine.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.799
Well,
you obviously know me very well.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.480
Making progress, I hope.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.959
I wouldn't say I've got
the full p
