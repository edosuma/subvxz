WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(liquid pouring)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(clink)

00:13.581 --> 00:16.648
(suspenseful music)

00:28.429 --> 00:29.695
- Maps.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.930
They're magical things.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.266
They can lead you to
places you've never been

00:34.268 --> 00:36.235
but they can also
show you new ways

00:36.237 --> 00:38.437
of getting to places
you think you know.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.340
My name is Sophie Carson.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.809
My family's been to so
many places on the map

00:43.811 --> 00:46.078
that you'd think we
wouldn't need one by now.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.316
Edward Carson, archeologist,
leader of our tribe.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.085
Hunter and gatherer.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.723
Katie Carson, queen
of the Carson clan

00:57.725 --> 00:59.758
and world class map reader.

01:01.796 --> 01:05.664
Aramus, Armenia, the
Baba Temple in Bahrain

01:05.666 --> 01:08.367
and Xinjiang, China, all places

01:08.369 --> 01:11.303
we've followed Dad looking
for the Holy Grail.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.805
I'm not joking.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.274
My father's life work has
been to find five pendants.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.942
When worn around the neck,

01:16.944 --> 01:19.578
they bring great
power and wealth.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.149
But like all magic,
that comes with a price.

01:24.151 --> 01:27.586
A life's work for
Dad and Mom and me

01:27.588 --> 01:28.921
and oh yes.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.791
Emma, mini me.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.626
Not.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.763
How can your own sister
have an American accent

01:37.765 --> 01:39.698
when we're all English?

01:39.700 --> 01:40.933
I'll tell you how.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.502
A life lived
traveling, that's how.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.407
Anyway, we've trekked,
wandered, strayed off

01:48.409 --> 01:51.743
the goat trail as they
say Zalabiye, Syria.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.579
Why don't I tell
you about the legend

01:53.581 --> 01:55.681
that my family has been chasing?

01:55.683 --> 01:58.884
The one that has led us
back to Emma's birthplace?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.986
Sunny California.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.722
(dramatic music)

02:03.724 --> 02:06.091
Before books, before Scriptures,

02:06.093 --> 02:10.027
there were legends, whispered
stories of pendants.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.798
Rare jewels from the
five walked upon lands

02:12.800 --> 02:15.100
that gave the owner
the power of darkness

02:15.102 --> 02:16.435
and immortality.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.506
In ancient times the
holder was a queen.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.208
Queen Lily Bethany of the West,

02:23.210 --> 02:25.944
mother of all sand tribes.

02:25.946 --> 02:31.016
But one winter her only
son became ill, very ill.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.887
A breath away from death,
his mother had no choice.

02:34.889 --> 02:37.456
She turned to the dark
shadow from the south.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.357
Ohanzee.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.793
Ohanzee promised
Queen Lily Bethany

02:41.795 --> 02:44.296
that he would save
her first born.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.498
He would free her son
from the shadows of death

02:46.500 --> 02:48.934
in exchange for the pendants.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.738
Queen Lily Bethany
hesitantly accepted his deal,

02:52.740 --> 02:55.440
allowing Ohanzee the
power of her son's soul.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.678
Ohanzee tore the shadow
of death from the boy

02:59.680 --> 03:01.079
and took the pendants.

03:02.283 --> 03:05.817
However, there were
only four, not the five

03:05.819 --> 03:08.854
needed to grant him the
powers of the Holy Grail.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.590
He grew angry and cursed
his shadows and fire

03:11.592 --> 03:13.492
upon the sand tribes.

03:13.494 --> 03:17.429
Burning their villages
and cursing them to
eternal darkness.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.832
Finally, unleashing
his new power,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.601
he killed the boy and his mother

03:22.603 --> 03:25.404
with the very shadows
he'd promised to remove.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.706
It is said that this
was the very beginnings

03:27.708 --> 03:29.575
between light and darkness.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.645
And he had skulls
all over his body.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.782
- Ow.
- Sophie.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.351
- How's she ever going
to learn the good stuff?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.419
Are we there yet?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.687
- Are we there yet?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.821
- We've been driving for hours.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.723
- We've been driving for hours.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.558
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.826
- You're always copying me.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.728
- You're always copying me.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.630
- Girls, stop it.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.866
- Yay, starting a new school
in the middle of the year.

03:54.868 --> 03:55.734
I liked India.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.069
- I didn't.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.271
- You'll be fine,
Sophie, besides.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.242
What could possibly go
wrong in this place?

04:03.244 --> 04:05.410
- [Katie] Look
girls, palm trees.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.145
Oh, it's just like Cairo.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.514
- [Edward] Yes, with
slightly better toilets.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.786
Okay.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.724
- See kids?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.125
It's really nice.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.195
- [Edward] Come on
now, out you get.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.415
(high whine)

04:51.959 --> 04:54.826
- [Eddie] Mom, I'm gonna be
a scientist just like you.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.096
- Eddie?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.965
If you don't get to
school on time, bud,

04:59.967 --> 05:00.966
no science camp.

05:02.870 --> 05:03.769
I mean it, huh?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.516
- [Eddie] Oh (coughs) so stinky.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.923
(somber music)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.264
(explosion bangs)
(high whine)

05:32.266 --> 05:33.498
Oh, not again!

05:46.113 --> 05:47.279
- [Katie] This is where
they're putting us up.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.548
- Whoa.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.150
- No it's good, hey.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.454
- Yeah.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.690
- Let's go put our
stuff in our rooms.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.396
- I hope there are no
evil spirits here, Emma.

06:11.438 --> 06:16.508
(somber music)
(car horns beep)

06:19.113 --> 06:20.011
- Buddy.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.281
I'm not gonna ask again.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.118
- I'm almost finished.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.353
There's never enough time.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.863
Okay.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.333
Let's do this.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.041
- See, it's not so bad here?

06:50.944 --> 06:51.910
Good neighborhood.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.480
- Okay.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.415
- Great view.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.558
(laughs)

07:09.430 --> 07:10.929
(high whine)

07:10.931 --> 07:14.499
(explosion rumbles)
(groans)

07:14.501 --> 07:16.568
- Flaming balls of smoke.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.171
(smoke detector bleeps)
Smoke!

07:19.173 --> 07:20.071
Smoke, um.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.775
That's the smoke
detector going off,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.044
I can't even, oh.

07:26.046 --> 07:26.945
Ah.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.616
- [Katie] Sophie, Sophie,
hurry up, darling,

07:31.618 --> 07:33.618
you'll be later for
your new school!

07:33.620 --> 07:35.253
- [Sophie] (spits) Coming.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.324
- [Edward] Sophie, I have
to be at the dig by nine

07:39.326 --> 07:41.359
so you'll have to
walk to school today.

07:44.398 --> 07:45.597
- [Sophie] Oh, my book.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.134
- I'm gonna be late darling.

07:49.136 --> 07:52.037
Okay, okay, sorry about that.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.707
Darling, the toilet
isn't working.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.042
- Edward.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.109
- Well it wasn't me.

07:59.213 --> 08:00.479
- I wish I could get
her to move like that.

08:00.481 --> 08:04.182
And I guess you broke
another toilet again.

08:04.184 --> 08:08.487
- Well, I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.590
- See you later.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.524
- Bye honey.
- Bye darling.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.391
- Have a great first day.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.261
She's growing up so fast.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.696
- So fast.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.831
- She never tells me bye.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.902
- Bye Emma, get a room.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.938
- Maybe she's got an idea.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.974
- You're gonna be late,
it's your first day.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.308
- No you're right,
I've gotta go.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.343
- Go (laughs).

08:31.345 --> 08:32.210
- I love you.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.511
- Love you too.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.080
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:35.082 --> 08:35.947
- Good luck.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.852
- Give me that.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.759
- Two explosions in
less than 24 hours,

08:47.761 --> 08:49.794
that's gotta be a
record of some sort.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.597
- On the bright side, I
haven't blown up the house.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.266
Yet (laughs).

08:54.268 --> 08:55.200
- Are you an inventor?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.434
- I try to be.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.369
Although, some of
the experiments

08:57.371 --> 08:58.703
are better than others.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.604
- I'm Sophie.

08:59.606 --> 09:00.539
- I'm Edison.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.506
- Nice to meet you Edison.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.908
- [Edison] Nice to meet you too.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.210
- So what were the
explosions you were doing?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.548
(phone rings)
- You've reached

09:09.550 --> 09:12.584
Travis Jackson at Digs Are
Us, please leave your name

09:12.586 --> 09:14.920
and message after the tone.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.123
- Oh hi, Travis, this
is Doctor Carson.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.457
I'm running a bit
behind this morning

09:19.459 --> 09:21.359
and could be there shortly.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.061
I could use some coffee.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.163
Looking forward to
meeting you, old chap.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.905
Good morning, old
chap, how's it going?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.173
- Old chap.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.508
- Never mind that,
I'm sure it's great.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.243
All good in the
hood as they say.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.646
Tell me, where's the coffee?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.816
- Yes, good morning, sir.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.387
By the way everything
is as you requested.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.958
It's such an honor to
be working with you.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.160
Such an honor.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.862
I just can't believe it's
in our home town here, it's

09:59.066 --> 09:59.998
cool, in fact.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.466
- Yes, yes, quite incredible.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.903
You know what else
is incredible?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.404
Coffee.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.441
Strong, black coffee.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.576
Would you be a good lad
and maybe go get me some?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.479
- Good lad, sure, I'd love to.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.282
- Thank you.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.183
- BRB.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.551
- BRB.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.752
- Be right back.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.273
Here you are, sir.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.242
- Okay, right so,
continue digging here.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.343
- Yeah, but, Sir.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.545
- No, no, no, it's here.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.948
- It's a hundred yards
away, it can't be.

10:49.950 --> 10:50.849
Can't be here.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.819
- Did you perhaps
grab some creamer?

10:54.821 --> 10:55.887
- What's that?

10:55.889 --> 10:56.921
- Creamer.

10:56.923 --> 10:57.789
- Creamer?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.624
- Creamer?

10:59.626 --> 11:00.492
- Creamer.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.594
- Creamer.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.195
- I thought you
said you liked your

11:05.165 --> 11:06.731
coffee strong and black.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.067
- No no, I do, I do, but.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.869
I also like creamer.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.770
Thank you.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.072
- Sure.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.641
- [Edward] Thank you.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.645
- You've got to be kidding me.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.781
(groans)

11:34.494 --> 11:35.560
- Doctor Carson?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.129
It is a pleasure.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.665
- Please, call me Edward.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.800
- Of course.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.868
I am Zilbid.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.071
- Ah, he that is strong.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.439
- I am impressed.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.207
- Yes, well, I know
a few languages

11:49.209 --> 11:50.108
- I as well.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.912
I work for the museum's
cultural expert.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.747
I'm here to assist with the dig.

11:57.584 --> 12:02.620
We are all very excited to
be a part of this project.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.556
- Thank you, Zilbid.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.091
How long have you
been with the museum?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.793
- It feels like a lifetime.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.299
It appears you are
close to finding

12:14.301 --> 12:15.533
the last pendant.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.769
- Yes well, if all goes
well, that's the plan.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.440
- I'm at your service, Edward.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.485
- Okay.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.821
- Old chap?

12:36.823 --> 12:38.123
- Ah, thank you.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.961
No, no, no, needs sugar.

12:43.864 --> 12:44.829
Thank you.

12:44.831 --> 12:45.730
- Sugar.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.107
It does need sugar.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.782
- [Edward] Yes, okay.

13:05.819 --> 13:10.789
(children scream)
(bell rings)

13:13.894 --> 13:15.593
- [Eddie] So you just
moved in last night, right?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.762
- Yeah, what were you
doing in your garage?

13:17.764 --> 13:19.864
- Oh, I was just
working on something.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.299
My dad has me do
all my experiments

13:21.301 --> 13:23.168
out of the house,
just for safety.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.740
- Hey, have you finished
my homework yet?

13:28.742 --> 13:30.341
- No, I have a couple
more questions to do.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.643
- Wrong answer.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.846
Have you finished
my homework yet.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.982
- It's algebra, it's the,
you have all the equations

13:37.984 --> 13:39.717
and the data problems.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.286
My brain's gonna blow up.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.388
- Your future depends on
you getting my work done.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.157
- Okay, okay, third period.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.458
- Nice bow tie.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.694
Who do you think you
are, Benjamin Franklin?

13:49.696 --> 13:50.528
(laughs)

13:50.530 --> 13:52.130
- Nice face, not.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.400
- Oh, we got a live one here.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.802
- Do not make eye contact.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.070
Don't.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.272
- You're a jerk and
you two are idiots.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.440
- What are you doing?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.808
- Are you new?

14:03.810 --> 14:06.244
- Uh, you all need to apologize.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.078
- I do?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.413
- Yes, you do.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.448
- Johnny don't apologize.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.583
- Neither does Stuart.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.451
- Danni don't apologize either.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.955
- I hope you're not doing
their English homework too.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.691
- You need to learn
your role at my school.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.925
- Our school.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.194
- Or else you'll be
doing my homework.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.162
- And mine.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.633
- Hey kids, what's shaking?

14:30.770 --> 14:33.571
- Why, you look different
this year, Mr. Swaski.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.406
- Yeah, I lost a few pounds.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.675
I'm looking lean
and mean now, huh?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.344
You know what's not shaking, me.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.582
You guys are gonna be behaving
yourselves this week, right?

14:44.584 --> 14:46.885
Is everybody gonna go
to the Halloween party.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.219
- I don't know, maybe.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.120
- Maybe?

14:49.956 --> 14:51.256
What's your name.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.724
- Sophie Carson.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.027
- You must be new here, Sophie,
welcome to our little town.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.563
It's the best party
around (high ting).

14:58.565 --> 15:00.498
- It is, isn't it Edison?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.103
(laughs)

15:05.105 --> 15:06.337
- Look at him.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.021
- That's a story
for another time.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.392
(high ting)

15:27.394 --> 15:28.559
- You still teach here?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.894
- Substitute.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.129
You're the lunch man.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.598
- Who's ever heard
of a lunch man?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.867
- Yeah, well, I
can still send you

15:35.869 --> 15:37.835
to the principal's office.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.771
You settle down and
get back to work.

15:43.810 --> 15:48.479
- Oh, um, so, I'm
sorry, we're sorry

15:48.481 --> 15:50.949
and I just wanted
to give this to you.

15:54.054 --> 15:54.953
There, see?

15:58.158 --> 15:59.057
Hey.

16:00.894 --> 16:01.926
I'm really sorry.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.336
(bell rings)

16:12.238 --> 16:14.806
(door clangs)

16:15.842 --> 16:17.542
- Good morning, Class 5C.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.547
Please take a seat, or not,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.015
if you wanna learn that way.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.818
I'm going to be grading
you as a group today

16:26.820 --> 16:28.486
so Ellen, you may begin.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.955
- Nobody knew how
the curse started

16:30.957 --> 16:33.391
or how to stop it until a shaman

16:33.393 --> 16:34.859
came into their village.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.628
- He was an evil,
evil man and he cursed

16:37.630 --> 16:40.665
the first born of the
original owner of the pendants

16:40.667 --> 16:42.700
and with her blood
and his scepter,

16:42.702 --> 16:44.936
he could summon his first
love through the shadows

16:44.938 --> 16:47.438
but in the chaos, he
lost the pendants.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.640
- The legend says the
pendants when all together

16:49.642 --> 16:51.476
possess extreme power.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.011
It's the only way
he can ever find

16:53.013 --> 16:54.445
his true love again.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.547
- It's just a stupid legend.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.017
- That remains to
be seen, Johnny.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.952
So does anyone
know how the shaman

17:00.954 --> 17:02.220
can find his love again?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.824
- The peak of the super
moon lunar eclipse.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.925
- A blood moon.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.160
- Correct.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.661
Sophie, why don't
you come on up,

17:10.663 --> 17:12.829
tell us why you're here,
we're so glad to have you.

17:12.832 --> 17:13.731
Come on.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.634
Don't be shy, come on now.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.278
- Hi, I just came from India

17:27.280 --> 17:28.679
where my parents were on a dig

17:28.681 --> 17:29.914
and they were
looking for a scepter

17:29.916 --> 17:31.849
which once belonged to
an evil medicine man

17:31.851 --> 17:33.584
and they found the scepter.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.088
- Huh, I always wondered
if witch doctors were real.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.790
- I can answer
that, Miss Turner.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.291
They are real.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.292
- Nerd.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.794
(everyone laughs)

17:42.796 --> 17:46.898
- Quiet class, this is your
one and only warning, Johnny.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.332
- Yeah, for like the fifth time.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.967
- Hey.
(crowd groans)

17:49.969 --> 17:53.271
You can have a seat,
thank you so much.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.374
So, a super lunar eclipse
is a very rare event.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.278
Does anyone know how many
times a century this happens?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.513
- It happens four
times a century.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.116
- Great, and what
makes this so special?

18:06.820 --> 18:09.287
- The moon appears much
larger than normal.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.354
- You're right as well.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.090
Does anyone else now why?

18:12.092 --> 18:13.558
- It's at the perigee.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.992
- Sophie, you keep amazing me.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.928
You girls may have
a seat, thank you.

18:19.065 --> 18:22.433
The moon is at its
closest point to the Earth

18:22.435 --> 18:25.570
and this is called a super moon.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.171
This is the eclipse
when the moon,

18:27.173 --> 18:29.674
the Earth and the
sun are all aligned.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.876
The Earth's shadow
falls on the moon

18:31.878 --> 18:35.913
which causes the sun
to glow bright red.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.883
There will be a test
on this, Johnny.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.151
Can we please have
our next group,

18:40.153 --> 18:42.053
I'm so excited to hear.

18:42.055 --> 18:42.954
Thank you.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.056
Good job, Sophie.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.260
(high whine)

18:52.031 --> 18:54.499
(low rumble)

18:56.402 --> 18:59.137
(pen scribbles)

19:03.309 --> 19:06.711
(squeals)
- Hello, Miss Turner.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.946
- My god.

19:09.983 --> 19:14.452
- I need your
assistance, Miss Turner.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.420
- How'd you get in here?

19:16.422 --> 19:18.256
- There is nothing
to be afraid of.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.124
Not yet.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.493
- Who are you?

19:23.363 --> 19:27.098
- (speaks foreign language)

19:28.635 --> 19:32.203
Do as I command and
you will remain human.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.251
- What?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.156
(somber music)

20:03.503 --> 20:06.304
- [Edward] There's my baby.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.805
- I'll be damned.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.479
(eerie music)

20:22.989 --> 20:24.989
- We need to secure the site.

20:24.991 --> 20:25.890
- Yes sir.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.483
(slow music)

20:58.992 --> 21:00.258
(door clicks)
- Are you still staring

21:00.260 --> 21:02.393
at those creepy things?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.828
- This is my life's work.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.599
- [Katie] I know,
I think it's cute.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.534
- You think these
things are creepy?

21:10.536 --> 21:15.606
- (laughs) I'm about
to take it off.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.849
(cars rumble)

21:25.985 --> 21:31.055
(dramatic music)
(Emma hums)

21:44.270 --> 21:46.671
(Emma hums)

22:00.153 --> 22:02.586
- You go here and I go there.

22:05.725 --> 22:10.695
(high scream)
(dramatic music)

22:23.443 --> 22:25.242
- Hey, I wanted to tell you.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.380
I wanted to tell
you, are you okay?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.816
- I think I saw a ghost.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.250
- Do you need a Scooby snack?

22:33.252 --> 22:34.719
- I'm serious.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.954
- Those cartoons are
way too scary for you.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.256
I wanted to tell you that we
have guests over tomorrow night

22:39.258 --> 22:42.093
so I need you to be on
your best behavior, okay?

22:42.095 --> 22:44.028
Who am I kidding, you're six.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.530
Do you want me to
leave the light on?

22:46.532 --> 22:49.300
- I don't know, will
you stay with me?

22:49.302 --> 22:52.970
- Ah, you're so sweet.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.839
Of course I won't, goodnight.

22:59.545 --> 23:03.914
(low growl)
(gasps)

23:05.885 --> 23:08.352
(bell rings)

23:13.092 --> 23:14.925
- Wait, if you sit with me,

23:14.927 --> 23:16.794
you'll be a social
outcast forever.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.462
- Seems like I already am.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.899
So what are you up to?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.702
- Oh its just a prototype,
nothing special.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.580
- I love Miss Turner, she's
my new favorite teacher.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.282
That lesson was amazing.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.485
- Yeah, Miss Turner's really
obsessed with that story.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.020
- It's actually
really interesting.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.855
- Oh, yeah, really like it.

23:44.857 --> 23:45.823
- Really?

23:45.825 --> 23:47.491
- Yeah, absolutely.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.811
- Nerd alert.

23:50.812 --> 23:51.928
- Someone thought
it'd be a funny idea

23:51.931 --> 23:53.164
to stink bomb me.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.133
- And what does that
have to do with us?

23:56.135 --> 23:56.934
- Your loser boyfriend.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.102
- He's not my boyfriend.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.771
- Oh, too fast to respond there.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.740
- Well, he put one in my shirt.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.775
You little runt, you're dead.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.277
- Dead.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.778
You hear?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.114
- Oh, hey, what is that I hear?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.816
It sounded like a little echo.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.985
- I know, I heard that too,
like that buzzing noise.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.787
- Oh yeah, what was that?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.389
- Don't you have
something stupid to say.

24:18.391 --> 24:19.390
- (scoffs) No.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.359
- You better watch it.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.228
Revenge his sweet,
you little witch.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.445
(group laughs)

24:41.447 --> 24:43.681
- Miss Turner, thank
you for suggesting this,

24:43.683 --> 24:45.850
that we all get together,
it was great idea.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.318
I think it's a
wonderful way to meet

24:47.320 --> 24:49.787
Sophie's history teacher
and our neighbor,

24:49.789 --> 24:52.122
so I hope you don't mind
we invited young Thomas

24:52.124 --> 24:53.357
to join us.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.759
- Uh, I don't mind, and
you made my favorite.

24:55.761 --> 24:56.660
- Oh.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.897
(can sprays)
- Emma.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.565
Where are your manners?

25:01.567 --> 25:02.900
- In my pocket.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.736
- That's quite all right Emma.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.038
I can take some if you
don't mind, thank you.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.209
- Well, I have to tell
you, a home cooked meal.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.777
- Oh.
- Unbelievable.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.982
- Lovely stuff.
- The pie wasn't really mine

25:17.984 --> 25:19.583
but it's not bad.

25:19.585 --> 25:22.152
- You know I love
this stuff, don't you?

25:22.154 --> 25:23.287
- Don't do it.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.989
- Do what?
- Edward, manners.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.390
- I'm not doing anything.

25:26.392 --> 25:29.126
(can squishes)

25:29.128 --> 25:30.127
- You're.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.128
(people chatter)

25:31.130 --> 25:32.429
- Family tradition, I'm afraid.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.398
- Thank you, family tradition

25:34.400 --> 25:36.767
- Uh, oh, family tradition.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.335
Come on, remember.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.604
- Hit me.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.109
(laughs)

25:45.111 --> 25:48.445
- Oh uh, well, I guess
when in Rome, huh?

25:48.447 --> 25:49.847
(can squishes)

25:49.849 --> 25:51.181
(laughs)

25:51.183 --> 25:52.449
- That was a lot, Dad!

25:52.451 --> 25:54.785
- It's gonna go everywhere.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.057
- Go on Miss Turner.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.759
(group yells)

26:01.761 --> 26:04.395
- Go on, Miss Turner.
- Come on!

26:06.432 --> 26:08.566
(laughs)

26:10.002 --> 26:13.737
- I was not expecting that.
- I was not.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.706
- [Sophie] I didn't think
she was actually gonna do it.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.241
- She went for it.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.577
- That is commitment,
commitment.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.845
That is commitment and a half.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.614
- Whipped cream,
I'm all for that.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.649
- That is amazing.

26:25.651 --> 26:26.817
- Everywhere.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.319
All in your hair.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.721
- Young lady, I think it's
time we got you to bed.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.423
Do you want to play
with your shadow puppets

26:32.425 --> 26:35.225
for a few minutes?
- Nope.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.297
- Goodnight Emma.
- Oh, it's so good.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.001
- [Thomas] Look at you,
you just went for it.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.536
- So where's your mom?

26:46.672 --> 26:48.739
Sorry, bad question?

26:51.210 --> 26:54.278
- [Miss Turner] And yes, I'll
be at the Halloween party.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.246
- My mom disappeared
when I was four.

26:57.550 --> 26:59.016
She was the best inventor.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.019
She invented all
kinds of things.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.454
- It should be fun.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.055
Have you given any thought
to your costume yet?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.491
- I've given more thought to
my costume than my speech.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.561
- Do you want your dad to
remarry or meet someone else?

27:11.831 --> 27:13.998
- Let me guess, archeologist.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.635
- Bond, James Bond.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.569
- Oh.

27:18.571 --> 27:20.571
- I guess it would be okay.

27:20.573 --> 27:22.539
- (laughs) I like it, I
get to be a Bond girl.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.274
- OH, I like that.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.576
- I want him to be happy

27:25.578 --> 27:28.912
and if someone
makes him happy then

27:28.914 --> 27:30.481
I guess that's okay.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.983
- What's your
costume, Miss Turner?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.052
- I don't know really, I
haven't thought about it.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.688
- Well I've got some ideas,
if you're interested.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.124
- Yes, I'm up for
ideas, I have to use

27:40.126 --> 27:41.592
the bathroom, do you?

27:41.594 --> 27:43.527
- Oh yeah, use the
one in our bedroom,

27:43.529 --> 27:45.462
this one isn't working.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.530
- Thanks, excuse me.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.369
- [Katie] Someone's got a crush.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.038
- It's time for a crush, right?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.072
- Yeah.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.940
- Everyone was doing it, right?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.344
(liquid squishes)

28:00.346 --> 28:04.048
- Besides, I'm not the only
one around here with a crush.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.085
(dramatic music)

28:29.308 --> 28:32.076
- As you were.
(laughs)

28:32.078 --> 28:34.545
(high whine)

29:03.809 --> 29:06.210
(deep bang)

29:50.890 --> 29:52.489
- Everything come out okay?
- What?

29:52.491 --> 29:53.557
- Sorry, sorry.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.426
- Fine, just fine,
I'm not really

29:56.428 --> 29:58.428
feeling too good, I'm gonna
have to call it a night

29:58.430 --> 30:01.365
but thank you so much,
everything was amazing.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.300
- Sorry that you're
leaving so soon.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.068
I hope everything's okay.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.570
- Thanks for coming.
- It will be.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.071
- Really grateful
for your interest

30:08.073 --> 30:10.507
in the pendants, it really
means a lot to me, well us.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.042
- Thank you, see you soon.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.710
- Okay, bye.

30:13.712 --> 30:14.611
- Bye.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.413
- Oh, bye.

30:20.052 --> 30:23.153
- She likes you.
(laughs)

30:26.725 --> 30:29.560
(car door bangs)

30:33.699 --> 30:36.600
(pendants rattle)

30:42.775 --> 30:43.907
(high screech)

30:43.909 --> 30:48.512
(dramatic rumble)
(screams)

30:48.514 --> 30:50.848
(car beeps)
- You were just

30:50.850 --> 30:52.449
gonna leave?
- Yes, I have to go,

30:52.451 --> 30:53.917
I don't feel well.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.086
- Look, let's go to that
Halloween party together, huh?

30:56.088 --> 30:58.055
It'll be fun and god
knows you need a date

30:58.057 --> 30:59.756
god knows I need one too.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.125
- That would be great,
look, I don't wanna give you

31:02.127 --> 31:04.828
the wrong impression, I
like you, I really do,

31:04.830 --> 31:07.030
I just got some weird
stuff going on right now.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.667
- Oh, well look, if you
ever wanna talk about it,

31:10.669 --> 31:12.336
my door's always.
- Tomorrow, I'll call you

31:12.338 --> 31:14.371
I can't right now, thank you.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.107
- Okay.
(car screeches)

31:18.310 --> 31:21.178
Okay, I just, guess
call me, right?

31:37.129 --> 31:38.595
- That was a fun night.

31:46.906 --> 31:47.905
Honey.
- Mmm?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.841
- Do you know where
my picture is?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.543
- I don't know.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.413
- Oh.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.751
(bell rings)

32:00.753 --> 32:03.120
(gum chews)

32:09.028 --> 32:10.594
- So I guess we'll see
you guys at he party,

32:10.596 --> 32:12.496
huh, nerds?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.197
- Considering my dad's
the guest of honor,

32:14.199 --> 32:15.766
I would think so.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.702
- Oh, you're some
big shot, aren't ya?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.404
- Big shot.
- Big shot.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.040
- Why do you even hang
out with him anyway?

32:23.042 --> 32:25.075
- Hey, you know, you
better shut up or

32:25.077 --> 32:26.877
I'm gonna make you pay.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.479
- Make me pay, for
your zit cream?

32:30.616 --> 32:32.249
You don't scare anyone
except your reflection

32:32.251 --> 32:35.085
in the mirror, what you
are is mean and bitter.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.486
- Hey.

32:36.488 --> 32:37.487
That's enough.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.458
You three, Principal's
office, now.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.131
Now.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.299
- You better watch it.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.969
- Watch it.
- Watch it.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.212
- Oh my gosh, Sophie,
he is going to kill you.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.180
- Bring it on.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.587
- [Reporter] And tonight
on Channel Nine News,

33:10.589 --> 33:13.190
we have a special event
in downtown Hermosa

33:13.192 --> 33:15.926
where Professor Edward
Carson is unveiling

33:15.928 --> 33:19.329
the two and a half
thousand year old amulets

33:19.331 --> 33:20.964
which were discovered
recently at

33:20.966 --> 33:23.333
the school grounds
at Hermosa High.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.501
- Miss Mayor can I get a moment

33:24.503 --> 33:25.736
I just have a few questions.

33:25.738 --> 33:26.970
- Well of course
you can, darling,

33:26.972 --> 33:30.207
I always have time to
speak to the media.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.076
- Awesome well, this event
is just amazing once again.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.511
The atmosphere is just electric.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.147
I mean look at all these
people all in costumes.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.785
- Quick, we don't
wanna get noticed.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.891
- Guys, if Mr. Swaski
sees us, we're gonna be

33:47.893 --> 33:49.393
in real big trouble.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.862
- Oh, he's just gonna send
us to the principal's office

33:51.864 --> 33:53.864
and we won't
actually go (laughs).

33:53.866 --> 33:56.400
- So what can you tell us
about the announcement?

33:56.402 --> 33:57.901
I mean there's a lot of
speculation over this

33:57.903 --> 34:00.103
archeological dig, so
what can you tell us?

34:00.105 --> 34:02.939
- Well, there will be a very
big announcement tonight

34:02.941 --> 34:05.042
but also people will
be able to get a chance

34:05.044 --> 34:07.911
to experience a
spectacular lunar eclipse

34:07.913 --> 34:09.579
I mean a super blood moon.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.815
- Hey, relax.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.317
Let's have fun, huh?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.386
- You'll just have to stick
around and see, handsome.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.286
- Sounds good.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.596
- Well, they're having fun.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.020
Come on.

34:33.021 --> 34:33.870
- Did you see what
Sophie was wearing?

34:33.871 --> 34:35.539
- Yeah, who was
she supposed to be?

34:35.541 --> 34:36.606
- Her dad.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.041
(laughs)

34:38.043 --> 34:39.476
Okay guys, now come on, quick,

34:39.478 --> 34:41.445
now we need to get to phase
two of Halloween Hell.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.281
- Really?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.248
Is that the best you
could come up with?

34:46.251 --> 34:48.085
It's shadow shape shifting time.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.120
- Still a terrible name.

34:51.824 --> 34:52.889
(laughs)

34:52.891 --> 34:54.558
- You want that.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.394
Thank you.
- God, I'm glad I'm here.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.929
I'm glad I'm here
for you tonight.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.798
- Are you?
- Yes, I know.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.935
- Are you ready for this?
- I'm ready for this

35:04.937 --> 35:06.303
I am, how do I look?

35:06.305 --> 35:08.872
- Handsome as always.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.375
- I think you're more
nervous than I am.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.877
- I'm just worried about Emma.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.546
New town, new babysitter and

35:17.649 --> 35:19.015
don't you think
there's something

35:19.017 --> 35:21.318
not quite right
about that guy or

35:21.320 --> 35:22.586
am I going mad?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.521
- No, no, no, she'll
be fine, I promise.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.090
Okay?

35:27.092 --> 35:27.991
- Okay.

35:30.562 --> 35:34.030
- My notes, I need
my notes for the.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.700
- Hey, you got this.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.138
(crowd applauds)
- What a great party.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.306
How's everyone feeling,
a good night so far?

35:43.308 --> 35:44.508
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

35:44.510 --> 35:46.843
- It's a great party,
but, don't forget

35:46.845 --> 35:50.947
keep your eye on the sky.
Â¶ Used to be together Â¶

35:50.949 --> 35:53.950
(soft piano music)

35:56.555 --> 35:58.388
- Wow, I had no idea.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.524
- Me neither.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.227
- Uh.

36:05.330 --> 36:09.299
Are you okay, it's
just, you've been acting

36:09.301 --> 36:11.368
kinda strange all night.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.903
- I'm just not feeling
myself tonight.

36:12.905 --> 36:13.803
- Oh, ah.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.207
Do you wanna go or?

36:18.277 --> 36:20.243
- No, not at all, I'm
sorry, please just

36:20.245 --> 36:21.444
excuse me for a minute.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.247
- Okay well, I'll.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.716
Be right here.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.954
(soft piano music)

36:35.460 --> 36:36.660
(door bangs)

36:36.662 --> 36:39.462
(dramatic music)

36:49.675 --> 36:51.308
- Where did she go?

36:51.310 --> 36:52.509
- I don't know.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.044
- Danni?
- Danni?

36:54.046 --> 36:55.445
- Danni, where are you?

36:56.648 --> 37:00.283
(deep rumble)
(speaks foreign language)

37:00.285 --> 37:02.385
(gasps)

37:05.324 --> 37:08.458
(screams)
- What are you doing here?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.493
- I saw something, I
don't know what it was,

37:10.495 --> 37:11.795
but I saw something.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.463
- That was you
playing the piano.

37:13.465 --> 37:17.901
- No, yes, but I
saw a shadow moving.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.369
I swear, I did.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.572
(gasps)

37:23.942 --> 37:25.442
- What did I do, what did I do,

37:25.444 --> 37:28.778
what did I do, what did I
do, this can't be happening,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.180
this can't be happening.

37:30.182 --> 37:31.481
- What's she talking about?

37:31.483 --> 37:32.949
- Leave me alone!

37:32.951 --> 37:34.317
- We've got to help her.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.052
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.687
- Leave me alone, I
did what you asked,

37:37.689 --> 37:41.124
leave me alone, you
said I would be okay

37:41.126 --> 37:43.493
you gave me your word.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.061
- We gotta get out of here.

37:45.063 --> 37:49.566
(gasps)
(deep laugh)

37:50.669 --> 37:53.970
(screams)
- Blood moon.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.341
(speaks foreign language)

37:58.343 --> 38:01.711
- Miss Turner, what are
you doing with that guy?

38:01.713 --> 38:02.779
He's 12 feet tall.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.048
- Run, run, run!

38:09.821 --> 38:12.856
- Dude, your costume's
completely rad.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.824
- You have to run.
- No thanks.

38:15.861 --> 38:16.860
(screams)
- Go.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.696
- Freshmen.

38:21.166 --> 38:24.067
(electric sparks)

38:25.337 --> 38:28.405
- Oh, hey, uh,
where have you been,

38:28.407 --> 38:30.273
we've all been a little worried.

38:30.275 --> 38:30.940
- Number three.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.313
(laughs)

38:40.118 --> 38:44.154
(low whine)
(screams)

38:44.156 --> 38:47.457
(laughs)
- I didn't mean run

38:47.459 --> 38:49.259
and leave me.
- Sorry.

38:50.262 --> 38:52.395
(laughs)

38:55.600 --> 38:58.568
- Well, well, look who it is.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.636
- Come on, we need to go now

38:59.638 --> 39:01.004
- Are you with them now, Danni?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.840
- Yes, and we've gotta
go, these shadows.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.076
- Oh shadows, you mean
like these shadows.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.745
- Ugh.
(laughs)

39:08.747 --> 39:10.613
- They're, they're.
- Oh, scared of

39:10.615 --> 39:13.383
your own shadow?
- No, I'm scared of his.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.855
- This doesn't scare me.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.757
- I'm really disappointed
in you, Danni.

39:20.759 --> 39:21.958
What are you even running from,

39:21.960 --> 39:23.226
it's an illusion.

39:23.228 --> 39:26.529
- Yes, I mean no,
we've gotta go.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.697
These shadows.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.533
- I'd like to introduce,
Mr. Edward Carson.

39:30.535 --> 39:35.605
(crowd applauds)
(crowd cheers)

39:38.643 --> 39:40.643
- Thank you, thank you.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.880
Well, first and foremost,

39:43.882 --> 39:46.416
I would like to thank my wife.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.218
She's my crown
jewel, I mean how did

39:48.220 --> 39:50.120
a guy like me end up with her?

39:50.122 --> 39:53.323
(door bangs)
(screams)

39:53.325 --> 39:56.760
(deep rumble)
- It's an illusion (laughs)

39:56.762 --> 39:58.795
- This doesn't scare me.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.399
- Oh, so scary, looks so real.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.100
- Yeah, how did you do that?

40:04.102 --> 40:06.603
- She's supported me, well us,

40:06.605 --> 40:09.506
while we spanned
the globe in search

40:09.508 --> 40:12.375
of these magnificent
ancient treasures.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.911
(deep rumble)
- Yeah, right.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.214
(laughs) He's not that scary.

40:19.284 --> 40:21.484
- And tonight, to
have all the pendants

40:21.486 --> 40:25.221
together for the first
time in over 2500 years

40:25.223 --> 40:26.756
is quite simply amazing.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.628
And all within view
of this absolutely

40:31.630 --> 40:35.231
incredible spectacle,
a total lunar eclipse,

40:35.233 --> 40:37.000
accompanied by a
super blood moon,

40:37.002 --> 40:38.568
how about that
ladies and gentlemen?

40:38.570 --> 40:40.837
(crowd applauds)
How about that?

40:40.839 --> 40:44.340
(deep rumble)
(laughs)

40:44.342 --> 40:47.076
(crowd screams)

40:51.516 --> 40:53.383
- These wonderful people,
fulfilling a lifelong dream

40:53.385 --> 40:57.120
of mine, one my
family followed me on.

40:57.122 --> 41:01.391
(growls)
(screams)

41:02.661 --> 41:04.694
(gasps)

41:09.367 --> 41:12.001
- Their power,
according to legend

41:12.003 --> 41:16.172
has the power to swallow
worlds, forever trapped.

41:17.642 --> 41:22.212
(high scream)
(gasps)

41:23.849 --> 41:25.982
(chokes)

41:34.659 --> 41:37.160
(high whine)

41:39.931 --> 41:41.231
- Unbelievable.

41:44.269 --> 41:45.235
- Where's Sophie?

41:45.237 --> 41:46.302
= She's with Edison.

41:47.172 --> 41:51.875
(high whine)
(high scratch)

41:51.877 --> 41:54.110
(screams)

41:55.847 --> 41:57.113
- Sophie!

41:57.115 --> 41:59.115
- We have to go now, the
shadows, they're here!

41:59.117 --> 42:04.153
(crowd screams)
(crowd yells)

42:07.592 --> 42:08.641
- Dad!

42:08.642 --> 42:09.691
- Dad, dad, the
shadows, they're coming!

42:09.694 --> 42:12.228
- We've got an evacuation here.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.199
(deep rumble)

42:19.638 --> 42:21.704
- Everyone needs to leave.

42:21.706 --> 42:22.605
Now.

42:24.609 --> 42:27.277
(high scratch)

42:30.382 --> 42:31.314
- How did he get my scepter?

42:31.316 --> 42:33.082
- It's not yours, it's his.

42:33.084 --> 42:37.587
(chokes)
(deep rumble)

42:37.589 --> 42:39.889
- I'm no longer interested.

42:41.626 --> 42:44.427
- Go, now, everybody,
go, go, go!

42:46.197 --> 42:47.196
(crowd screams)
(deep rumble)

42:47.198 --> 42:49.799
- Come on!
(screams)

42:49.801 --> 42:51.968
(chokes)

42:57.742 --> 42:59.709
- Run!
- Go, go, go, go!

43:02.447 --> 43:03.713
(doors bang)

43:03.715 --> 43:08.051
- [Thomas] Go go go,
come on, go, come on!

43:08.053 --> 43:11.788
Get out, get out.
- We've got an evacuation here

43:11.790 --> 43:13.923
we got a situation!

43:13.925 --> 43:16.693
(lightning crackles)
Go go, go.

43:16.695 --> 43:19.262
(deep rumble)

43:25.604 --> 43:28.037
- [Thomas] Come on, Eddie.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.038
You got it.

43:30.241 --> 43:33.176
(deep growl)
- What is this place?

43:34.112 --> 43:36.012
- Good evening.
(gasps)

43:36.014 --> 43:37.580
- Who are you, you
scared us to death.

43:37.582 --> 43:38.915
- No time for
questions, I'll explain

43:38.917 --> 43:40.016
as we get further
through the tunnel,

43:40.018 --> 43:41.551
let's go, come on, follow me.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.457
- Where are your parents?

43:47.459 --> 43:50.593
- We don't have parents,
we live in the foster home.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.262
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

43:53.264 --> 43:55.398
- Stuart lived there with us.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.333
I can't believe he's gone now.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.702
You guys are lucky
to have parents.

43:59.704 --> 44:00.937
- You are indeed.

44:00.939 --> 44:05.608
Hear me now, I need
Sophie, I need Edison,

44:06.711 --> 44:09.379
Thomas, Edward and
Katie to come with me.

44:09.381 --> 44:12.482
Johnny, you and
Danni go that way.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.350
It goes to outside.

44:14.352 --> 44:15.852
- It goes to the outside.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.186
We've got to get Emma.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.322
- Emma's safe,
she's at our base.

44:19.324 --> 44:20.857
- Base?

44:20.859 --> 44:22.291
What the hell is going on here?

44:22.293 --> 44:23.559
We need to get Emma.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.330
And what do you mean she's okay?

44:27.332 --> 44:29.966
- Your babysitter,
he's one of us.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.336
Johnny, Danni, good luck.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.203
This is the end of
the road for you,

44:34.205 --> 44:35.505
it's nothing personal.

44:35.507 --> 44:36.973
- Nothing personal?

44:36.975 --> 44:38.775
You're sending us down into
a black tunnel of death.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.510
- No, not going down there.

44:40.512 --> 44:41.978
- Me neither.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.213
- [Sophie] If they go, we
all go, and I mean all of us.

44:44.215 --> 44:45.748
- She said all of us.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.152
- We're a team.

44:49.154 --> 44:51.154
- [Edison] A team.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.322
- A team.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.223
- A team.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.059
- A team.

44:57.128 --> 45:01.364
All right then,
team, let's do this.

45:03.635 --> 45:06.102
(high whine)

45:07.505 --> 45:09.005
- Quickly, move!

45:09.007 --> 45:11.774
(dramatic music)

45:12.677 --> 45:17.680
(low growl)
(high crackle)

45:23.188 --> 45:26.022
(engine rumbles)

45:28.293 --> 45:31.627
(electricity crackles)

45:43.408 --> 45:45.108
- All right, let's settle down,

45:45.110 --> 45:46.576
everyone got a place to sit?

45:47.412 --> 45:48.711
- Where are we?

45:48.713 --> 45:51.447
- This is our command center.

45:51.449 --> 45:53.416
- Nope, this is a van.

45:54.586 --> 45:58.755
- (laughs) Actually,
this is our TTF67,

45:58.757 --> 46:00.590
it's one of many
vehicles we have

46:00.592 --> 46:03.326
situated around the world,

46:03.328 --> 46:06.329
to be as inconspicuous
as possible

46:06.331 --> 46:08.998
so that we can move
when we need to move.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.637
Ohanzee now has the six pendants

46:14.639 --> 46:19.142
and his scepter,
so he now has power

46:20.178 --> 46:24.313
to control the shadows
and he has been

46:24.315 --> 46:27.750
watching you, Edward,
and following you

46:27.752 --> 46:29.519
for the past decade.

46:29.521 --> 46:32.455
He has been searching
for these pendants

46:32.457 --> 46:36.092
for 2500 years and
you managed to find

46:36.094 --> 46:38.761
all of them in 10.

46:38.763 --> 46:41.230
Legend has it that
he will come after

46:41.232 --> 46:42.899
your first born.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.168
- I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, we're gonna fix this.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.303
He's not gonna hurt you, okay?

46:47.305 --> 46:49.372
- That thing's the devil.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.574
- He's worse than the devil.

46:51.576 --> 46:54.777
Listen to me, Edward, Katie.

46:54.779 --> 46:57.480
He will come after Sophie, but

46:58.817 --> 47:03.386
after that, he
will come for Emma.

47:03.388 --> 47:05.388
- No.
- What?

47:05.390 --> 47:08.724
- What?
- He won't quit, Edward.

47:11.462 --> 47:12.361
- Me.

47:15.233 --> 47:16.766
It's okay.

47:16.768 --> 47:18.768
(door bangs)

47:18.770 --> 47:20.036
- Emma!
- Emma!

47:20.038 --> 47:22.004
- How are you here?
- Team, this is

47:22.006 --> 47:23.372
Officer Jason Loveless.

47:25.944 --> 47:26.943
- The babysitter.

47:28.046 --> 47:30.046
Thank you so much for
taking care of her.

47:30.048 --> 47:31.848
- I prefer Officer Loveless.

47:33.251 --> 47:34.183
It's my pleasure.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.486
We track all potential legends.

47:37.488 --> 47:40.022
- So the Loch Ness
Monster and the Yeti?

47:40.024 --> 47:41.290
They're all real?

47:41.292 --> 47:43.459
- Did you not see
what we all just saw?

47:43.461 --> 47:45.294
- [Jason] Yeah,
they're real all right.

47:45.296 --> 47:47.129
- As real as Ohanzee.

47:47.131 --> 47:51.200
- Indeed, they are all
as real as Ohanzee.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.569
- Travis is our scientist,
resident inventor

47:53.571 --> 47:55.705
and generic problem solver.

47:55.707 --> 47:58.241
- (laughs) I do a bit of
everything around here.

47:58.243 --> 48:01.844
We've been watching Ohanzee,
studying his shadows,

48:01.846 --> 48:03.713
devising a way to capture him.

48:03.715 --> 48:05.915
All is not so good in the hood,

48:05.917 --> 48:09.118
as some people say.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.286
- What about Miss Turner?

48:10.288 --> 48:11.921
- His power must
have grown over time.

48:11.923 --> 48:15.191
Ohanzee is more
dangerous now than ever.

48:15.193 --> 48:16.092
- And how do we stop him?

48:16.094 --> 48:16.993
- Travis.

48:18.363 --> 48:22.465
- Well, we're dealing with
a new form of fusion energy.

48:22.467 --> 48:24.901
Basically, we have
a fusion generator

48:24.903 --> 48:28.170
that drives a motor, a
teeny tiny little motor.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.439
That motor uses kinetic energy

48:30.441 --> 48:34.577
of radioactive decay
particles to produce thrust

48:34.579 --> 48:39.582
in a single space no bigger
than the size of a dime,

48:39.584 --> 48:41.817
that's what give it it's power.

48:41.819 --> 48:45.054
You see, for every
proton/boron pair

48:45.056 --> 48:48.925
that reacts to the laser, at
least three alpha particles

48:48.927 --> 48:52.094
are created, each one
of those alpha particles

48:52.096 --> 48:55.331
have a tremendous
amount of kinetic energy

48:55.333 --> 48:56.933
contained in them.

48:56.935 --> 48:58.167
- Like an atom smasher.

48:58.169 --> 49:03.105
- Yes, yes (laughs)
very similar but not.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.709
Now these electromagnetic forces

49:06.711 --> 49:10.446
pushes alpha particles
and they are directed

49:10.448 --> 49:13.416
to a power source
and in such a small

49:13.418 --> 49:17.053
and dense space it
creates a virtual.

49:17.055 --> 49:19.455
- A black hole.
- A black hole.

49:19.457 --> 49:22.658
(laughs) In theory, yes.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.327
- You haven't tested it?

49:25.363 --> 49:26.262
- Um.

49:36.441 --> 49:39.608
(dramatic music)

49:39.610 --> 49:41.077
- That's going to save us?

49:41.079 --> 49:44.580
- All you have to do
is push this button

49:44.582 --> 49:47.650
to get Ohanzee into
the fusion beam.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.720
The beam will then collapse
the light on itself

49:50.722 --> 49:52.755
hopefully taking him with it.

49:52.757 --> 49:54.490
- We've been preparing
for this confrontation

49:54.492 --> 49:57.226
as long as you've been
searching for the pendants.

49:57.228 --> 49:59.362
Ohanzee's a formidable foe.

49:59.364 --> 50:01.430
He's very powerful
and he's using

50:01.432 --> 50:03.966
their power for evil.

50:03.968 --> 50:06.202
It will take you and
your family, Edward.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.336
Starting with Sophie.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.174
Look here, the shadows.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.510
- They're not shadows at all.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.046
- They're not.
- They're black holes.

50:17.849 --> 50:19.181
Well how do we stop it?

50:19.183 --> 50:20.282
- I don't like this.

50:20.284 --> 50:21.584
- Are we safe here?

50:21.586 --> 50:25.221
- I invented the BBFG
for this very purpose.

50:25.223 --> 50:28.090
- Boron-based fusion.
- Fusion generator.

50:28.092 --> 50:31.794
You seem to be pretty well
educated on this matter.

50:31.796 --> 50:33.295
- I was taught a few
things about fusion.

50:33.297 --> 50:35.831
- Hm, maybe we can
even save the world.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.533
- Let me get this straight.

50:37.535 --> 50:42.405
You guys protect the
world from all this evil.

50:42.407 --> 50:43.672
- The universe, actually.

50:43.674 --> 50:44.940
- And who ae you?

50:44.942 --> 50:46.575
Part of the government?

50:46.577 --> 50:47.943
- We're a
quasi-government group.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.278
We went rogue to
preserve the vision

50:49.280 --> 50:50.980
of our original members.

50:50.982 --> 50:52.148
We mustn't waste anymore time,

50:52.150 --> 50:53.849
Ohanzee is on his way.

50:53.851 --> 50:55.051
- How do you know that?

50:56.254 --> 50:58.187
- Because we're inviting him.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.123
- When the moon is
completely engulfed

51:01.125 --> 51:03.526
in the Earth's shadow,
you will have to get

51:03.528 --> 51:07.863
close enough to him so
the BBFG can capture him.

51:07.865 --> 51:09.965
- According to the
history books I've read,

51:09.967 --> 51:11.667
Ohanzee's been
roaming the universe

51:11.669 --> 51:13.736
looking for the
pendant that Dad found

51:13.738 --> 51:16.038
and in order for him to
use the pendants power

51:16.040 --> 51:18.207
he has to hurl the
first born of the finder

51:18.209 --> 51:20.876
of the pendant into
the shadow world.

51:20.878 --> 51:22.778
Ohanzee will come for me.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.481
I'm the bait, our only weapon.

51:25.483 --> 51:28.284
Ohanzee needs light to
create shadow warriors.

51:28.286 --> 51:30.719
If I can draw him away
from all light sources

51:30.721 --> 51:33.189
I can beat him back
into the darkness.

51:33.191 --> 51:36.692
I need to get him to
come here, the tunnels.

51:36.694 --> 51:38.494
If I can find him and
make him follow me

51:38.496 --> 51:42.031
back into the tunnels, we
have a chance with the BBFG.

51:42.033 --> 51:43.432
- Whoa.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.867
- That thing will
spaghettify her.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.603
No way, no way, I will do it.

51:47.605 --> 51:49.472
- Dad!
- No, I will do it.

51:49.474 --> 51:51.207
- Dad, I have to do this.

51:51.209 --> 51:52.641
- Sophie.

51:52.643 --> 51:55.144
- What we're asking
Sophie to do is dangerous.

51:55.146 --> 51:58.380
Ohanzee will send
his shadows to you.

51:58.382 --> 52:01.884
We need you to get close
so we can trap them.

52:01.886 --> 52:02.718
- Not happening.
- No.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.353
- Sophie, get over here.

52:04.355 --> 52:06.222
- Our hope.
- Your hope.

52:06.224 --> 52:08.991
Dear god, we don't even
know who you people are.

52:08.993 --> 52:11.694
Quasi-government
rejects, rogue squad.

52:11.696 --> 52:12.628
Are you kidding me?

52:12.630 --> 52:15.197
And that thing, that, that

52:17.101 --> 52:21.303
generator, is there a plan B?

52:21.305 --> 52:22.805
- Look, we know it's
hard to imagine.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.040
Each legend is
different and Ohanzee

52:25.042 --> 52:27.776
is the worst we've had to
deal with this century.

52:27.778 --> 52:30.613
But this is real,
Sophie could die.

52:30.615 --> 52:32.281
She's our only hope.

52:32.283 --> 52:34.884
Tomorrow by this time,
maybe even the Earth

52:35.853 --> 52:37.086
could cease to exist.

52:38.356 --> 52:42.258
If this does not
work, we're doomed.

52:46.731 --> 52:50.432
- She's right, it's
real, I have to try.

52:52.236 --> 52:53.235
I'm your girl.

52:54.038 --> 52:56.872
(thunder cracks)

52:57.975 --> 53:00.876
(thunder rumbles)

53:05.082 --> 53:06.115
- All right.

53:09.854 --> 53:12.521
An ear piece to stay in contact.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.858
The button, capture Ohanzee.

53:17.662 --> 53:19.461
And the famous torch gun.

53:23.134 --> 53:24.033
Good luck.

53:24.902 --> 53:25.801
You can do it.

53:31.409 --> 53:32.308
Our girl.

53:34.812 --> 53:39.181
(rain patters)
(car rumbles)

53:39.183 --> 53:44.153
(high scream)
(low rumble)

53:45.389 --> 53:50.025
- I'm sorry for you
know, school stuff.

53:50.027 --> 53:51.193
- Apology accepted.

53:52.096 --> 53:54.597
- I'm sorry, I feel bad.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.533
You actually taught me
a few things (laughs)

53:57.535 --> 53:59.535
- You guys taught me
a few things, too.

54:00.805 --> 54:01.704
- Good luck.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.274
- Good luck.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.188
- Come back safe.

54:19.190 --> 54:20.823
- I will.

54:20.825 --> 54:21.724
- Here.

54:39.210 --> 54:41.677
I don't wanna die without
ever having a girlfriend.

54:42.947 --> 54:44.213
- I don't have a pen.

54:45.016 --> 54:46.248
- Oh, uh.

54:58.429 --> 55:00.329
- Wait till I get back.
- Okay.

55:05.403 --> 55:06.402
I believe in you.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.106
- I love you, little sis.

55:12.043 --> 55:13.409
- I love you too, big sis.

55:18.783 --> 55:21.150
- Wait, I'm going too!

55:21.152 --> 55:22.584
- Edison, Edison, no you're not.

55:22.586 --> 55:24.386
- Dad, I have to,
I have to go help.

55:24.388 --> 55:25.621
- Let's get this little
one to the bunker,

55:25.623 --> 55:27.289
where it's gonna be
safer and calmer.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.458
We have people to
look after her,

55:29.460 --> 55:30.726
she'll be safe, I promise.

55:30.728 --> 55:33.495
- Edison, I don't think
it's a very good idea.

55:33.497 --> 55:34.763
Listen to your father.

55:34.765 --> 55:37.533
- No, no, no, I can
do it, I can help.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.468
I wanna do something.

55:39.470 --> 55:40.903
(laughs)

55:40.905 --> 55:41.804
Please.

55:43.107 --> 55:46.742
- You heard him, this
young man wants to help.

55:46.744 --> 55:49.511
He wants to help, he
wants to do something.

55:49.513 --> 55:53.482
- You'll need an ear piece,
stay in contact with us.

55:53.484 --> 55:54.616
- I'll see you soon, Dad.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.352
- You promise?

55:56.354 --> 55:59.254
- I'm so sorry, you
shouldn't have to do this.

55:59.256 --> 56:00.255
- But I do.

56:01.459 --> 56:02.991
- Sophie, we love you.

56:02.993 --> 56:03.892
- I love you too.

56:08.966 --> 56:10.799
- Go be a hero.
- Okay.

56:14.071 --> 56:16.071
(sobs)

56:20.244 --> 56:21.777
- Take my hat.

56:21.779 --> 56:23.545
- I'm coming with
you, I'm gonna help.

56:23.547 --> 56:24.680
- What?
- Me too.

56:26.784 --> 56:27.683
- Me too.

56:30.454 --> 56:32.621
- [Edward] You need this.

56:35.526 --> 56:40.596
(thunder cracks)
(screaming)

56:41.699 --> 56:46.468
(dramatic rumble)
(dramatic music)

56:54.645 --> 56:57.279
(high beeping)

56:58.582 --> 57:02.518
(thunder crackles)
(screen crackles)

57:02.520 --> 57:04.586
- Totality lasts.
- 14 minutes.

57:04.588 --> 57:07.756
- Okay.
- They'll have 14 minutes.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.526
(dramatic music)

57:12.530 --> 57:14.696
- I don't see anything.
(screen crackles)

57:14.698 --> 57:18.467
- Look.
(speaks foreign language)

57:18.469 --> 57:21.303
- Mesopotamian.
- Sumerian.

57:21.305 --> 57:23.005
A 10,000 year old language.

57:23.007 --> 57:26.208
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

57:26.210 --> 57:29.344
- I don't think you wanna know.

57:29.346 --> 57:31.814
(high whine)

57:37.588 --> 57:39.188
- Sophie, Sophie,
we've lost sight

57:39.190 --> 57:41.123
of Ohanzee, just stay put.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.291
- I'm not going anywhere.

57:43.327 --> 57:44.526
(thunder crackles)

57:44.528 --> 57:46.462
- I'm sorry, we can't do this.

57:46.464 --> 57:47.796
Danni, are you with me?

57:47.798 --> 57:48.697
- Yeah!

57:50.367 --> 57:52.100
- Johnny, Danni, no!

57:54.238 --> 57:55.137
- Oh god, oh god.

57:57.241 --> 57:58.240
- What are they doing?

57:58.242 --> 57:59.441
For god's sakes.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.586
(high whine)

58:14.692 --> 58:18.026
(thunder rumbles)
(crackle)

58:18.028 --> 58:19.294
- The lights!

58:19.296 --> 58:20.929
- What's happening, Travis?

58:20.931 --> 58:23.665
- It's okay, we
planned for this.

58:27.171 --> 58:28.370
- Try and help me open it.

58:28.372 --> 58:31.540
- It won't work,
the door won't open.

58:31.542 --> 58:32.441
Run!

58:34.545 --> 58:35.711
(high whine)

58:35.713 --> 58:37.913
Come on, come on.

58:37.915 --> 58:38.814
- They're dead.

58:38.816 --> 58:40.649
- But we're not.

58:44.054 --> 58:45.220
- We lost em.

58:46.357 --> 58:47.923
- We gotta get em
into that tunnel.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.024
- It's our only hope.

58:52.129 --> 58:53.695
- Sophie, Sophie,
if you can hear me

58:53.697 --> 58:56.098
get back in the tunnel,
get back in the tunnel.

58:57.434 --> 58:59.735
- He is one creepy looking guy.

58:59.737 --> 59:01.370
- We really need to find them.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.071
- I think they need to find us.

59:03.073 --> 59:04.473
- Johnny, Danni!

59:04.475 --> 59:06.375
Where are you?
- Guys!

59:07.511 --> 59:11.280
- Please don't do this.
- We're totally trapped.

59:11.282 --> 59:14.049
- We're gonna die,
we're gonna die.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.885
- Ssh, ssh, shh.
- Why, why?

59:16.887 --> 59:21.957
- Shut up, ssh, listen.
- (laughs) Oh god, what is it?

59:23.027 --> 59:24.693
- Don't move.
- Why, what is it?

59:27.898 --> 59:29.364
- False alarm.

59:29.366 --> 59:31.033
(loud thump)

59:31.035 --> 59:32.768
(screams)
- Open the door,

59:32.770 --> 59:37.072
open the door.
(screams)

59:37.074 --> 59:38.240
- We can't leave them.

59:38.242 --> 59:39.174
- Do you really
think they'd help us?

59:39.176 --> 59:40.776
Really?

59:40.778 --> 59:42.744
- They would, they did.

59:43.847 --> 59:44.846
For Stuart.

59:46.750 --> 59:47.883
- For Stuart.

59:51.188 --> 59:52.187
- Open the doors.

59:52.189 --> 59:53.088
- I got it.

59:54.124 --> 59:56.725
(doors clack)

59:56.727 --> 59:58.727
- Guys, we got a big problem.

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.629
- They have to
get in the tunnel.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:02.864
- You're right, there's an
override panel in the tunnel.

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:04.132
- Maybe we can bypass it.

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.001
- Yeah.
- I'm going.

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:07.235
- Edward.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:08.704
- No listen, this
is all my fault.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:10.372
My daughter's about
to die out there.

01:00:10.374 --> 01:00:11.206
I'm going.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.641
- Yep, I'm going too.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.142
- No, Thomas.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.410
- We don't have time to
chat about this, let's go.

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.512
- The bypass wires
are red and white.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:19.514
Just connect them,
it should work.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:20.315
Hopefully.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.416
- Yes, go, go!

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.186
- [Edison] What we do,
what we do, what do we do?

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.487
I don't now what to use.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:27.589
I don't.

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:28.490
(screams)

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:30.592
Oh, oh (laughs).

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:33.762
- Oh, that sound.
- They're coming for me.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.632
- Have to find
something, I mean.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:41.703
- What do you have?
(speaks in foreign language)

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.706
And we thought it was
safer with the lights on.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.442
(metal rattles)

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:52.014
- And we didn't
bring a flashlight.

01:00:56.587 --> 01:01:00.956
(speaks in foreign language)
(high whine)

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.491
- Three, two, one.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.532
Come on, work.
- I knew I shouldn't

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.000
put my life in your guys' hands.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.169
Why did I do this?
- Why, I don't know why.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.406
- Oh no.
(all scream)

01:01:17.408 --> 01:01:18.807
Please, come on.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.410
- You've gotta be kidding me.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.412
- Just, just pick something.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.047
- Okay, okay.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:25.947
Let's see.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.257
(high scream)
- Come on, come on, please.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:37.459
I'll be good, I promise.

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:39.394
- Is it working?

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.798
- Why don't you go
and have a look?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.803
(high scrape)
(high whine)

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:55.210
(speaks in foreign language)
- Come on, please.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.645
- It's not working.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:57.679
- Okay wait.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:00.382
- I'll get straight As,

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.718
I'll study every
day, just please.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.520
(speaks in foreign language)

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:09.424
(thunder cracks)
- No!

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:10.559
- Try another!

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.396

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.997
(doors clang)

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:16.898

(doors clang)

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:47.629

(high whine)

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:51.466

(light flashes)

01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.008
(laughs)

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.714

01:03:06.717 --> 01:03:07.716
Dad, no!

(screams)

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.253
- Do what you have to
do, Sophie, I love you!

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:13.054
- Dad it's me he wants.

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:14.856
- Go, Sophie, please!

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.329
- Your life for his.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:26.635

(high crackle)

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.977
- This is our only chance.
- Let's go.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.979
- No, no, no, son, stay.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.481
She can do this.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.316
- Dad, she needs my help.

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:43.451
I can do this.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.087
I love you, Dad.

(high whine)
(screams)

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:19.154
(thunder crackles)
- It's me you want.

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:22.858
- You don't have
to do this alone.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.893
- Hurry, you must
have something.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:26.428
- [Edison] I don't
know, I don't know.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.797
- [Sophie] You must
have something.

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.899
- I don't know.
- What can we use?

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.735
(thunder crackles)

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:37.239

(laughs)
(screams)

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.286
Come on.
- I don't know,

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:52.888
I mean there's a strobe light.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.557
- He's too far away, we'll
never reach him with that.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.859
- Okay, wait.
- What?

01:04:57.861 --> 01:04:59.327
- It's Halloween!

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:06.034
- This needs to be the
best idea you've ever had.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.569
I have to do this.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.204
- Do it.

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:10.372
- Here.
- Okay.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:15.277
- Go back to where
you came from.

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:17.512
(rumbles)

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:24.953
(laughs)
(screams)

01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:30.025
(lightning crackles)
(shouts)

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:34.729
(high whine)
(groans)

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:40.535
(groans)

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:49.844
(explosion rumbles)

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.550
(metal clacks)

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:57.552
- [Thomas] Edison!

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.788
- Sophie?
- Edward, oh my god,

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.024
Edward, where are
you, where's Sophie?

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.130
(dramatic thump)

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.899
- Hey, what the heck?

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:14.869
Hey, wake up.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:16.938
- Edison!

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:19.607
- Wait.
- Edison.

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:21.443
- Oh thank god.

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:22.544
- Dad?
- Come here.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.746
- It worked?

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.817
It worked, it worked.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:30.185
- Oh my god.
- It worked!

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:31.920
- Come here, buddy, come here.

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.154
Come here, oh.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.323

darling, come up, come up.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:39.127

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:43.331

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:48.603
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.505

- Where are you?

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.412
(metal clangs)

01:06:57.414 --> 01:07:00.382
- Dad, I didn't lose your hat.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:04.019
- Oh, it's okay, darling.
- I didn't lose your hat.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.021
- I don't need my hat.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:07.856
Oh my god, we
thought we lost you.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.124
We love you.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.292
- Really, we're fine here.

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.767

I love you so much.

- Oh my god, come here.

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:35.083
- I love you.
- I'm so glad I'm here.

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:39.387
- [Edward] I missed you so much.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.890
- You did it.
- No, we did it.

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.929
- Sophie, Edison, Everyone.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.533
We have someone who wants
to say something to you.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:54.202
(boots crunch)

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.474
- Lucy?

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.042
- Dad, what is it?

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.313
- Lucy?
- Mom, mom!

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.250
Mom, oh!
- Oh, I missed you both

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.720
so much.
(sobs)

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.123
I love you both so much.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:18.193
So much, I'll never
leave you again.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.062
- We thought that you were dead.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.363
What's going on?

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:23.832
- Mom, you're staying right.

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:27.167
- Edison, I'm not
going anywhere.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.439
(sobs)
Wait, wait, I have

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.174
something to say, hold on.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.879
All of you are very brave.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.148
Very selfless to
sacrifice your wellbeing

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.649
for the benefit of mankind.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.886
Edison, your mind
is your best asset

01:08:45.889 --> 01:08:48.256
and your imagination is
gonna take you places

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:50.390
only you can imagine.
- Thanks, Mom.

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:54.162
And this is my
girlfriend, Sophie.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.162
- Sophie.

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.166
A girlfriend, huh?

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.636
You are a bright ray of
light in the darkness.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:05.372
Built to lead and
discover new things.

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:07.175
You both have a destiny.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:12.147
Danni, Johnny, your
bravery set you apart

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:15.450
and we would be honored
if you would join us.

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:16.283
- For dinner?

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:17.952
I'm starving.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.625
- If you would join our mission.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:27.060
Our mission to keep the
universe safe from evil.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:29.430
To protect those who
cannot protect themselves

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:33.334
and to sacrifice it all
for the greater good.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.969
- Lucy?

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.738
Who are we exactly?

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:45.546
- Kids, welcome to The
League of Legend Keepers.

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:49.417
(dramatic music)
