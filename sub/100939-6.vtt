00:33.867 --> 00:35.910
(loud sipping)

00:42.167 --> 00:44.169
(elevator bell dings)

00:47.172 --> 00:50.133
Okay, runway model,
you look fantastic.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.342
What's different?

00:51.426 --> 00:53.094
Gee, thanks.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.096
You know what I mean.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.098
Something's going on.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.184
Maybe I'm just
having a good day.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.227
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.980
-You got a Birkin.
-It's no big deal.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.691
It is absolutely a big deal.
Is this a Bianca hand-me-down?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.443
No.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.279
Why? Does it look...
does it look used?

01:11.362 --> 01:13.490
No, it looks gorgeous.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.992
Are your hands clean?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.245
So, wait-- did you buy this?

01:19.329 --> 01:21.206
Yeah, I-I... I wanted one.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.167
Everybody wants one,
like a yacht or a pony.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.878
Ooh, it's the swivel latch.
I love the swivel latch.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.922
How do you know so much
about Birkins?

01:29.005 --> 01:30.507
I was raised around rich people.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.509
Ooh, saddle stitching.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.677
So, wait,
where did you buy this?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.346
At a... a... sample sale.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.182
Really? Well, you're lucky
you didn't get scammed.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.476
-What do you mean?
-Well, if it were counterfeit,

01:41.559 --> 01:43.186
the feet would screw off,
but these don't.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.687
See? They're hammered in.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.023
-Huh.
-(laughs softly)

01:47.106 --> 01:49.025
(sing-songy):
Lucca has a Birkin.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.152
I...
Shh.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.699
Thank you, Frank,
for giving us another chance.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.201
-(chuckles softly)
-Uh, please.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.371
We're not here
about your firm, Adrian.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.206
We are here about you.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.166
-Me?
-Yes.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.210
-Did you watch the Democratic
debates this year?
-Yeah.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.420
-Which one? (laughs)
-Any of 'em.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.422
(laughs)
We started out with the most

02:11.506 --> 02:14.342
diverse slate in our history,
but come the end of January,

02:14.425 --> 02:17.262
no candidate of color
went the distance.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.889
And that's something
we need to correct.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.560
Four years from now, we need
an African-American candidate

02:23.643 --> 02:24.769
that can go the distance.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.272
I agree.
So how can I help?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.440
You can be that candidate.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.072
Are you kidding me
right now, Frank?

02:36.155 --> 02:38.408
No. Look, we don't
expect you to win,

02:38.491 --> 02:41.077
but we want to groom you to stay
on the stage until Iowa.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.079
Black voters need
to see themselves up there.

02:43.162 --> 02:45.540
But you want me
to run for president?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.126
Yes.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.461
Wow.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.422
WOMAN:
You're a fighter,
but with gravitas.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.382
LANDAU:
We saw your punditry from
last year. It was very good.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.259
You spoke eloquently
on issues that matter.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.595
You seem very comfortable
in your own skin.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.597
You've made a name for yourself
on police brutality,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.599
and that takes you away
from the Kamala Harris problem.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.602
-And you're tall.
-(chuckles) People like that.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.021
But I've said some very
controversial things, Frank.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.939
You're not afraid
to break the rules,

03:10.023 --> 03:12.400
which is a good thing, because
there's no rulebook anymore.

03:12.483 --> 03:16.446
Donald Trump took it, burned it
and took a shit on the ashes.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.656
And if he wins in November,
God help us,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.326
we need to come back in 2024
with everything we've got.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.953
Can I, um, think about this?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.122
-Mm, of course.
-WOMAN: But in the meantime,

03:26.205 --> 03:28.124
-it's confidential.
-Oh, absolutely.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.417
Not a word to anybody.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.837
Okay.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.133
It's beyond confidential.

03:37.216 --> 03:40.511
Not your mother,
not your shrink, no one.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.307
Okay.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.476
They said what?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.436
In 2024.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.813
Oh, they don't expect me
to win the nomination.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.983
It's more about defining
the future of the party...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.401
You're the future of the party?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.987
-You're jealous.
-No, I am not.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.282
-(laughs)
-I j... just...

04:01.366 --> 04:02.992
What are your positions?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.828
Medicare for all?
Section 1325

04:05.912 --> 04:09.040
of the U.S. immigration code?
Troops in Northeast Syria?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.459
-Maybe you want to be
my policy advisor, huh?
-I'm the reason

04:11.542 --> 04:14.295
the DNC came into this office
in the first place.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.131
And, unlike you, I have actually
worked in government.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.508
Mm, like "Kamela" Harris.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.219
It's Kamala.
Learn how to say her damn name.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.095
And what, are you-are you saying

04:22.178 --> 04:25.515
that former prosecutors
are unelectable?

04:25.598 --> 04:28.768
Or just black, female
former prosecutors?

04:32.146 --> 04:33.314
Congratulations.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.024
Why, thank you.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.653
I have to head to court.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.198
Better work on your platform.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.326
Huh.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.704
Would it kill them
to recruit a woman

04:47.787 --> 04:49.747
every once in while?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.165
(whistle blows)

04:54.085 --> 04:55.753
ADRIAN:
Melanie! Melanie!

04:58.339 --> 04:59.716
Looking good.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.718
My leg was starting to... cramp.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.512
I need to...
stretch it out more.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.056
-You ready for court?
-Not really.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.725
Talk about butterflies.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.269
You'll be fine, Melanie.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.938
But look, I wanted to catch you
before we go to court.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.982
We're changing strategies.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.693
We're what?
Why?

05:18.776 --> 05:21.404
Well, we think that, given
the politics of the situation,

05:21.487 --> 05:24.073
we have a better chance
of success going with race.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.617
Um... if that's what you think.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.870
But look,
nothing else has changed.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.789
You are still
the injured party here.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.917
So what do I wear in court?

05:35.001 --> 05:38.212
I was six
when I learned to swim,

05:38.296 --> 05:41.257
uh, which is late
compared to the other girls.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.968
Uh, there was no pool near me.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.764
My mom would get me up
quarter after 3:00,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.265
get me to the pool by 5:00.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.767
I'd work out till 7:00.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.935
Then she'd have me
at school by 8:00.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.104
Uh, it was about
an hour-and-a-half drive

05:55.188 --> 05:56.564
each way, depending on traffic.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.941
Did you have
a private coach, Melanie?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.152
No.
Just my mom.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.571
So even though you didn't
have the advantages of your

06:03.654 --> 06:05.281
teammates, you still made
finalist on the Olympic team?

06:05.364 --> 06:06.949
Objection. Relevance?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.951
Overruled.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.037
Try "counselor is testifying."

06:11.120 --> 06:12.455
Counselor is testifying.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.998
-Sustained.
-ADRIAN: Melanie,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.793
in 2019, was there a scheduled

06:16.876 --> 06:18.711
qualifying meet
for the Olympic trials?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.630
-Yes.
-And was that

06:20.713 --> 06:23.466
-rescheduled for this year?
-Yes.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.675
-ADRIAN: Why was that?
-Objection.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.469
The witness was not the one

06:26.552 --> 06:28.721
doing the rescheduling,
Your Honor.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.807
She's hardly in a position
to know why.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.809
I'm guessing she has an opinion.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.019
As I am also guessing
that your client,

06:35.103 --> 06:37.730
the Olympic Committee,
has an opinion,

06:37.814 --> 06:38.981
-so, overruled.
-(quietly): Go ahead.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.025
Uh, the meet
was rescheduled to 2020

06:41.109 --> 06:42.819
to give Sadie Lipton
more time to train.

06:42.902 --> 06:46.656
And Sadie Lipton
is the swimmer who replaced you

06:46.739 --> 06:48.616
-on the Olympic team?
-Yes.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.828
And Sadie Lipton
is obviously white, right?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.288
-MELANIE: Yes.
-Okay, I got it.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.499
Uh, is there any reason
to believe

06:56.582 --> 06:58.376
that race played a part
in this decision?

06:58.459 --> 07:01.379
I'm not someone
who sees racism in everything,

07:01.462 --> 07:04.507
but our team doctor,
Dr. Ludovic--

07:04.590 --> 07:07.635
he thought I couldn't hear him
when he said:

07:07.718 --> 07:11.013
black people's bones
are denser than whites,

07:11.097 --> 07:14.517
that elite swimmers
need a low bone density,

07:14.600 --> 07:15.685
so blacks were
at a disadvantage.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.563
All right, I'm getting it.
Uh, thank you very much, dear.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.022
Next?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.357
NIA:
As president

07:21.440 --> 07:22.900
of U.S. Olympic Swimming,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.694
what is your principle function?

07:24.777 --> 07:28.406
Of course I'd like to think
it was to inspire others,

07:28.489 --> 07:31.409
but the truth is, my principle
function is to lead by example.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.452
And what was your reaction

07:33.536 --> 07:36.539
when Dr. Ludovic's remarks about

07:36.622 --> 07:38.374
African-American bone density

07:38.457 --> 07:41.210
-got back to you?
-I fired him that same day.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.921
Is there racism
on the U.S. Olympic Committee?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.424
No. And if there were,
I would weed it out.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.218
Thank you.
Nothing further.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.555
-Mr. Pezner,
what's Rule Number 50?
-Oh, objection, Your Honor.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.265
-I haven't even
asked my question, sir!
-Because Rule Number...

07:54.348 --> 07:55.600
-It's got nothing
to do with anything.
-Wai... Uh, uh, uh, uh,

07:55.683 --> 07:57.685
Hey, eh, eh, eh,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.021
Somebody want
to clue the judge in here?

08:00.104 --> 08:01.272
I mean, what is Rule 50?

08:01.355 --> 08:03.524
PEZNER:
It is the new rule

08:03.608 --> 08:05.568
that prohibits
political protests

08:05.651 --> 08:07.945
by athletes
at the Olympic Games.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.447
Okay.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.199
Counselor, connect the dots.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.910
You knew, sir, did you not,
that Melanie Evers had,

08:13.993 --> 08:16.454
in the past, participated
in political protests?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.539
Listen, I am sympathetic
to Black Lives Matter.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.375
I am not interested
in your sympathies, sir.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.586
-I'm asking you if you knew.
-Objection,

08:23.669 --> 08:25.504
Your Honor.
Badgering the witness.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.758
Eh, but not much of a badger.
Overruled.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.551
-Yes. I knew.
-And isn't that

08:30.635 --> 08:32.303
the reason that you
kicked her off the team?

08:32.386 --> 08:33.596
She was not kicked off the team.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.973
Her time was slower
than the other swimmers.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.725
Slower than Sadie Lipton
by one-tenth

08:37.808 --> 08:39.268
-of a second.
-PEZNER: Which is slower.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.270
You changed the rules, sir,

08:41.354 --> 08:44.440
to let Sadie Lipton compete
in 2020, and thereby

08:44.524 --> 08:47.109
-replace our client,
Melanie Evers.
-NIA: Okay, when

08:47.193 --> 08:48.903
did this become
a debating society?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.404
Uh, you know,
I kind of like debates.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.949
They-they often
illuminate the truth.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.409
Counselor, what remedy
are you seeking?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.161
For the Olympic Committee
to abide by

08:57.245 --> 08:59.247
its own rules
and draw its competitors

08:59.330 --> 09:00.456
from the swimmers who competed

09:00.539 --> 09:03.751
in the 2019 meet.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.795
Give me the afternoon.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.129
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.054
That's it?

09:15.137 --> 09:16.472
Yes.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.641
I mean, who delivered it?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.476
No one saw.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.562
(sighs)
Why didn't you ignore it?

09:25.273 --> 09:27.525
Do you remember Judge Itzelitz?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.485
Yeah, a few years ago.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.612
There was, um,
a bribery scandal?

09:31.696 --> 09:34.657
Yeah. He was set up
on a Big Pharma case.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.493
He ignored Memo 618.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.578
Now he drives an Uber.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.543
Cases disappearing,

09:45.626 --> 09:47.962
subpoenas discarded,
judges expelled.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.880
Who has this power?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.716
Guess who got a Birkin bag.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.967
Marissa.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.011
Oh. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.470
Hey, Julius.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.516
(sighs)

10:00.599 --> 10:02.685
Okay.
That's what I know.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.687
How about you?

10:04.770 --> 10:08.316
Well, there was a man
waiting in my husband's office.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.318
He warned him
that I better back off.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.528
-What man?
-No name.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.572
Kurt doesn't know how he got in.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.325
-He was wearing this.
-I...

10:17.408 --> 10:19.702
I had a man
waiting in my chambers.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.039
No name.
Also, a visitor's pass.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.583
He... left this

10:25.666 --> 10:27.752
if I wanted to talk.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.011
What are you doing?

10:37.094 --> 10:39.388
-Calling him.
-Julius, are you serious?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.515
In Proverbs, it's written:

10:41.599 --> 10:44.560
"When justice is done,
it brings joy to the righteous,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.104
but terror to evildoers."

10:47.188 --> 10:49.565
It's what I always believed.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.859
Now I just have to enact it.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.285
Hi.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.371
Hello.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.705
Where'd you put it, Lucca?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.919
It's nothing special.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.964
Gah!

11:14.048 --> 11:16.634
-Oh, did you-did you get it
at a sample sale? Where?
-Were there any left?

11:16.717 --> 11:18.219
-Were they-were-were
they just Birkins?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.639
There is no sample sale.
I bought it at Hermès.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.932
I'm just...
I'm embarrassed.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.016
MARISSA:
Really?

11:25.684 --> 11:28.479
Yeah, I treated myself. I...

11:28.562 --> 11:30.564
I know.
It's extravagant.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.650
No. It's-it's a...
good investment.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.610
They do go up in value.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.654
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.948
Good for you.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.993
Okay.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.578
It's just me now.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.788
Did Bianca buy you that bag?

11:45.871 --> 11:47.790
-No.
-Then why are you
being so cagey?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.083
I'm not being cagey.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.293
You are totally being cagey.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.670
And I looked it up.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.464
That Birkin costs, what, like...

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
-$20,000?
-Jesus,

11:57.550 --> 11:59.635
you are a one-woman
surveillance state.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.595
-Thank you.
-I bought it

12:01.679 --> 12:03.305
with what I won playing poker.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.684
Holy fuck. So it really was
a lot more than $1,500.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.811
-A little more.
-If this bag costs...

12:08.894 --> 12:09.937
$20,000, you'd only buy it

12:10.020 --> 12:12.314
if you knew
you had a lot left over.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.607
So...

12:13.691 --> 12:14.650
$200,000?

12:14.733 --> 12:17.319
Did you win $200,000?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.320
More?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.947
Let's not play this game.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.490
-$500,000?
-Marissa.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.658
Fuck.
A million?

12:22.741 --> 12:23.659
(clears throat)
Okay.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.244
I have to get back to work.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.830
And you don't tell anyone
about this.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.333
Okay, but you need
to do something for me.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.543
Talk to David Lee.

12:32.626 --> 12:33.669
Why?

12:33.752 --> 12:35.838
Your winnings.
The taxes on them.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.840
Did you win them from gambling?

12:37.923 --> 12:39.175
And was it down in Saint Lucia?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.469
That makes it
all more complicated.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.179
David is an asshole,

12:43.262 --> 12:44.680
but he lives for this stuff.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.682
Just talk to him.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.809
BAILIFF:
All rise.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.186
BRICKNER:
Okay.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.395
No, no.
No, you don't have to get up.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.022
Uh, this shouldn't
take very long.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.024
I've already made my decision.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.485
Your Honor, may we approach?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.695
Uh, I was about to rule.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.572
We have information
that may impact your ruling.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.199
BRICKNER:
All right.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
Come on.
The more the merrier.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.246
Your Honor,
I feel the need to point out

13:09.330 --> 13:11.540
the counterfeit nature
of Mr. Boseman's pleadings.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
-What the hell are you...
Counterfeit?
-The real issue

13:13.792 --> 13:15.085
with Sadie Lipton
being on the Olympic team

13:15.169 --> 13:16.670
isn't that she's white--

13:16.754 --> 13:18.506
it's that she's transgender.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.883
-What are you talking about?
-But to identify her

13:20.966 --> 13:23.010
as such would entail

13:23.093 --> 13:24.261
taking a political position

13:24.345 --> 13:26.055
Mr. Boseman
would rather not take.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.265
-Your Honor...
-Wait, wait, wait. She's a...

13:28.349 --> 13:29.934
-What is she?
-She was biologically

13:30.017 --> 13:32.269
born male but

13:32.353 --> 13:35.189
two years ago began
transitioning to female.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.900
And you were aware

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
that this swimmer was trans?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.153
I was.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.780
But I felt then, as now,

13:42.863 --> 13:44.573
that our strongest case rests

13:44.657 --> 13:47.117
-with racial discrimination.
-Oh.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.370
That's not what they were saying
when we were negotiating.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.580
-They never mentioned race.
-All right. Wait. (shushing)

13:51.664 --> 13:54.124
So you're-you're saying
that you're using race

13:54.208 --> 13:56.085
because the politics
works better for you?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.586
That is unfair.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.255
-But true.
-Th...
-All right, look,

13:59.338 --> 14:00.339
here's what we're gonna do.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.926
You're gonna have to make
a decision, Counselor.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.928
Race is not working for you
so far.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.263
-(chuckles) Okay.
-But, you know,

14:07.346 --> 14:09.056
if you want to amend your suit,

14:09.139 --> 14:11.016
I'm all ears.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.730
Counselor?

14:21.193 --> 14:22.278
Okay.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.238
We would like
to amend our pleadings.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.906
See?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.116
Was that so hard?

14:27.199 --> 14:29.243
-No, Your Honor.
-No.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.454
Okay. From race to trans,
let's go.

Liz. Liz, I need you

16:15.641 --> 16:18.185
They called you out
on the trans issue, didn't they?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.395
Yeah. I need you

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
-in court today.
-Can you get

16:20.979 --> 16:21.730
-someone else?
-No.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.940
You'll be more sensitive.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.775
Plus, the optics are better.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.694
It's a political minefield.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.571
And you're a political person.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.699
No, you're a political woman.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.534
And I need a woman.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.911
-Is this about your DNC stuff?
-What?

16:35.994 --> 16:37.204
-No.
-Adrian.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.415
Hey, you-you have
that sound in your voice

16:39.498 --> 16:40.958
-when you're lying.
-Okay,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.419
better for Melanie
if she has a man

16:43.502 --> 16:45.504
and a woman representing her.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.214
Look, I got to go, Liz.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.757
Thanks.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.801
Hey. Morning.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.761
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.430
I was just coming to see you.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.265
Yeah, we had
a-a recess in court.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.558
Ah. Mm.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.517
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.603
So...

17:01.687 --> 17:03.272
I've thought about it,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.607
and...

17:05.691 --> 17:07.276
the answer is yes.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.279
I'll move in.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.740
(chuckles)

17:12.823 --> 17:14.825
-That is great.
-Yeah.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.079
No, it isn't.
What?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.080
-No.
-What happened?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.124
No, this is great.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.500
I...

17:26.336 --> 17:27.463
Adrian.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.464
What the fuck?

17:28.547 --> 17:29.923
I'm sorry.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.800
My mind is on something else
right now.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.510
(scoffs)

17:33.594 --> 17:34.720
All right.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.727
DNC came to my office
this morning.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.646
And they asked me--
I mean, this is bizarre--

17:44.730 --> 17:47.441
they want me
to run for president.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.820
-(laughing)
-I know.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.156
-(laughs): Wait.
-(chuckles)

17:54.239 --> 17:55.949
-I know, I know.
-When?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.493
2024.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.161
Are they crazy?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.997
Now, they don't think
I'll become president.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.291
They just want a black person
up onstage and...

18:04.374 --> 18:07.044
Ah. Okay, so they asking
a lot of people.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.963
You are really cutting into
my self-esteem, Charlotte.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.924
(laughs)

18:14.676 --> 18:16.011
Oh.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.514
(chuckles)

18:18.597 --> 18:21.391
Now I get it. (chuckles)

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
What?

18:24.311 --> 18:25.813
You don't want
to move in together anymore.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.106
You're worried about me.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.858
You're worried
about my "issues."

18:29.942 --> 18:31.318
What issues?

18:31.401 --> 18:34.029
The issues
we don't discuss, Adrian.

18:34.112 --> 18:37.199
The issues that'll be a problem
for your campaign.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.786
Look, I don't even know
if I'll do it.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.665
You'll do it.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.167
I can see it in your eyes.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.046
If I do,

18:51.129 --> 18:53.048
whatever your issues are

18:53.131 --> 18:55.717
won't... impact it.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.219
I swear.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.388
Charlotte,

18:59.471 --> 19:01.932
I swear.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.188
Hey.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.274
When can you move in?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.530
How much of a windfall
are we talking about?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.408
This is just between us, right?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.118
Oh, come on, Lucca.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.829
I'm a lawyer. I say anything
and I'm disbarred.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.164
Do you want me
to work for you or not?

19:26.248 --> 19:27.749
-How much of a windfall?
-A million.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.543
And a half.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.423
Is this windfall a gift?

19:34.506 --> 19:35.424
No.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.426
Well... yes.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.428
$50,000 of it was.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.388
But the rest are winnings.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.931
A poker game.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.685
So you want to know
if it's taxable?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.770
-Yeah.
-It is.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.606
However, there are strategies
around that.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.773
Are they legal?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.108
They're rarely prosecuted.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.110
I want to do what's legal.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.946
And I need to invest
what's left after taxes.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.947
Where's the money now?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.033
-Where is it?
-Yes.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.618
Bank account?
Cashier's check?

20:02.701 --> 20:04.620
-It's not in your freezer.
-(chuckles)

20:04.703 --> 20:07.664
No, I-I don't exactly
have it yet.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.082
You don't have it yet?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.792
No. Not yet.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.295
The other people in this game...

20:13.378 --> 20:14.796
-They're deadbeats.
-No.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.173
They're rich.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.636
-What?
-Lucca, I work with the rich.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.095
They promise everything.
They give you nothing.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.097
That's not who these women are.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.807
Why, because
they're rich and powerful?

20:25.891 --> 20:28.268
The rich and powerful
think they're God's gift

20:28.352 --> 20:30.354
because everyone
treats them like God's gift.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.356
They get their
hotel rooms comped.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.858
They get gift rooms
where they can take anything.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.444
Their meals are bought
by everybody else.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.279
You already got
your million and a half

20:39.363 --> 20:41.490
in their smiles,
in their charms.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.033
-That's your winnings.
-N... Uh, no.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.826
That-that can't be.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.495
You have an I.O.U.
or a promissory note?

20:48.580 --> 20:51.833
Okay, call 'em up
and ask 'em for your money.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.002
I can't do that.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.712
Exactly, and they know that.

20:55.796 --> 20:59.174
Look, just don't buy anything
until you get the money.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.259
-Okay?
-(door closes)

21:04.721 --> 21:06.723
Thanks for doing this.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.644
Mr. Pezner,

21:10.727 --> 21:14.022
could you explain
how a trans woman qualifies

21:14.106 --> 21:16.525
to swim on the women's
Olympic team?

21:16.608 --> 21:18.902
Well, first, she must
make a declaration

21:18.986 --> 21:20.445
-that she is a female.
-Oh.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
So, as-as long
as you have standards.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.906
Objection.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.908
Uh, my guess is

21:24.992 --> 21:27.035
that counselor
was being sarcastic.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.830
But, just in case,
sustained.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.582
The athlete has to maintain
a testosterone level

21:32.666 --> 21:36.044
below ten nanomoles per liter
for 12 months.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.713
And that's what
the trans swimmer,

21:37.796 --> 21:38.964
-Sadie Lipton, had?
-Yes.

21:39.047 --> 21:43.176
Now isn't it true that most
women have testosterone levels

21:43.260 --> 21:44.553
way below that,

21:44.636 --> 21:46.054
at around, uh,

21:46.138 --> 21:49.182
1.7 nanomoles per liter?

21:49.266 --> 21:52.436
That's less than one-fifth
of that cutoff.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.437
I don't know.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.564
LIZ:
So why exactly

21:55.647 --> 21:57.566
would the U.S. Olympic team

21:57.649 --> 21:59.568
set the ceilings
for testosterone levels

21:59.651 --> 22:02.362
so much higher than the level
of biological women

22:02.446 --> 22:05.073
and-and closer
to testosterone levels of men?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.743
We are simply complying
with international guidelines.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.245
And-and not because you want men

22:10.328 --> 22:11.538
to be able
to compete on the team?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.248
NIA:
Objection, Your Honor.

22:13.331 --> 22:14.416
Offensive.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.251
I'm not the sensitivity police,

22:16.334 --> 22:18.086
and this is
a pertinent question,

22:18.170 --> 22:19.087
so I'll allow it.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.257
Uh, it has been established here
that you delayed

22:22.340 --> 22:25.594
the qualifying meet
for, uh, two months.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.971
-The swimmers needed
more time to train.
-Uh, isn't it true

22:28.055 --> 22:30.265
that without that delay,
Sadie Lipton

22:30.348 --> 22:32.392
wouldn't have qualified
for the Olympics?

22:32.476 --> 22:33.602
Her times were
consistently excellent.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.979
Yes, but her testosterone levels

22:36.063 --> 22:37.773
wouldn't have otherwise
been low enough

22:37.856 --> 22:39.649
long enough.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.234
Without that delay,
she couldn't have met

22:41.318 --> 22:42.611
the 12-month requirement.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.613
I believe that's true.

22:44.696 --> 22:48.283
So... the delay helped Sadie

22:48.366 --> 22:50.285
a lot more
than it helped anyone else.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.037
Right?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.289
PEZNER:
That was not the intent.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.416
LIZ:
That's good to know.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.506
(indistinct chatter)

23:06.051 --> 23:07.469
JOSIAH:
Hello, Julius.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.098
-Hello.
-(grunts)

23:11.890 --> 23:13.683
You always wear
the visitor badge?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.310
JOSIAH:
Oh.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.645
(chuckles):
I'm always a visitor.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.022
Sorry I'm late.
I was glad to get your call.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.857
We have a lot to discuss.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.651
-You start.
-Sure.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.944
A rocket docket?

23:24.027 --> 23:25.946
That's not quite
what we were discussing.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.406
What were we discussing?

23:29.449 --> 23:30.826
(chuckles softly)

23:30.909 --> 23:33.411
Let's see your cell phone.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
-I'm not recording.
-Yeah.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.337
The rocket docket
is not only unjust.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.840
It works for the angry.
I don't represent the angry.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.967
Who do you represent?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.511
People who like
order and control.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.721
-People in the government.
-Maybe.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.890
Now, here's a question for you.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.851
Do you want to go further?

23:55.934 --> 23:58.353
Do you want a seat
on the circuit court?

23:58.436 --> 24:00.605
That depends
on what I have to do.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.484
Stop with
the adolescent rebellion.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.153
No rocket docket.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.865
When I say someone
needs help, help him.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.950
And if I don't?

24:14.911 --> 24:16.288
Ah.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.999
The two thorns in my side.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.709
My husband says hello.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.254
Here's the thing about
melodramatic moves like this.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.547
They never work.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.049
Whenever I copy
something I see in the movies,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.551
I just get hurt.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.678
Is that a threat?

24:33.346 --> 24:35.557
I'll be seeing you two.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.395
(chuckles softly)

24:40.478 --> 24:42.063
You need to move.

24:52.741 --> 24:53.825
That's him?

24:53.909 --> 24:55.785
-(car lock beeps)
-Yep.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.081
Uh, get his license plate.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.712
It's a new car.
He doesn't have one.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.258
-There he goes. There he goes.
-Yeah.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.010
I see, I see.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.970
(horn honks)

25:14.054 --> 25:15.680
Jesus, he drives like a maniac.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.891
More like someone
who's never gotten a ticket.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.893
(horns honking)

25:20.852 --> 25:22.812
Jesus.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.275
He's speeding up.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.486
It's not helping
to narrate this, Marissa.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.782
Someone's following us.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.741
What?

25:34.824 --> 25:36.785
-MARISSA: Who is that?
-JAY: I don't know.

25:36.868 --> 25:37.786
-Are they together?
-I don't know.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.454
Maybe they're gonna squeeze us.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.623
-What is that?
-He'll skid to a stop,

25:41.706 --> 25:43.041
they'll close us in,
and then they'll strafe us.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.543
Stop talking.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.464
(horn honks)

25:49.548 --> 25:50.799
-Watch out!
-Whoa!

25:50.882 --> 25:52.425
(tires screech)

25:52.509 --> 25:54.135
WOMAN:
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

25:54.219 --> 25:56.763
-Fuck you in the face, fuck!
-Back up! Come on!

25:56.846 --> 25:58.431
-Back up!
-Get him to move!
Get him to move!

25:58.515 --> 26:00.141
He won't move.
You need to back up.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.645
-Fuck you. B-Bump his ass.
-No. That's not gonna do it.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.771
WOMAN:
Fucking hellfire!
What the fuck are you...

26:04.854 --> 26:06.564
-You're in the fucking way!
-MARISSA: Why are you

26:06.648 --> 26:07.357
-swearing so much?
-WOMAN: What?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.400
Because you fucked
everything up.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.652
I had him, and now you're
in the fucking way!

26:10.735 --> 26:13.363
-Wait, you're not following us?
-What?

26:14.572 --> 26:16.324
(car door closes)

26:16.408 --> 26:17.659
(engine starts)

26:17.742 --> 26:19.494
(tires squealing)

26:19.577 --> 26:21.621
(camera shutters clicking)

26:23.790 --> 26:25.667
-Did you get it?
-Uh, yeah.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.002
We lost him.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.504
He lost us. He was driving
like a psychopath.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.673
JAY:
But there was something else.
A woman was following us.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.175
-Following you? Why?
-JAY: She said
she was following the guy,

26:34.259 --> 26:35.844
too, and we got in the way.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.554
We ran her plates.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.972
Her name is Linda Shuck.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.725
Do you have her address?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.022
So...

26:47.105 --> 26:48.523
are you in?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.696
I have a question.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.198
A question's good.
Shoot.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.034
I'm seeing someone.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.036
-He or she?
-She.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.704
-Married?
-No.

27:02.787 --> 27:06.750
We're both single,
consenting adults.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.211
But...

27:13.465 --> 27:15.467
She might have some...

27:19.304 --> 27:21.389
...issues.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.017
-What kind of issues?
-Who is she?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.518
I'd rather not say.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.228
Fine.
What issues?

27:27.312 --> 27:30.315
A certain level of possible...

27:32.317 --> 27:33.568
...corruption.

27:33.651 --> 27:36.404
Get rid of her.
Do it now.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.114
Why?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.366
LANDAU:
You said there was
corruption there.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.909
There might be.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.203
So find out for certain
and show you want it.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.246
Adrian, we want you,

27:45.330 --> 27:47.290
but you have to want this.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.418
And wanting it
requires sacrifice.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.435
Hello.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.437
BIANCA:
What do you think
about this one?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.439
I have no idea
where I'm gonna put it,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.441
-but I think I need it.
-Yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.567
I've always heard
you should walk away

28:14.651 --> 28:16.653
from the thing you want,
and if it's still on your mind

28:16.736 --> 28:19.447
-the next day,
then that means it's yours.
-One day,

28:19.531 --> 28:20.782
I'm gonna disavow you
of your sensibleness.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.117
So, what's up?

28:23.159 --> 28:24.285
Nothing. I...

28:24.369 --> 28:26.246
Just a question about last week.

28:26.329 --> 28:29.332
St. Lucia?
It was fun, wasn't it?

28:29.416 --> 28:31.459
I'm fairly sure
I conjured this call.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.337
You've been on my mind. We need
a celebration dinner ASAP.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.922
(chuckles)
What are we celebrating?

28:36.005 --> 28:37.507
Your poker skills.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.135
And your newfound wealth.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.345
Ha! Dinner's on you.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.557
Okay.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.642
(phone beeps)

28:48.601 --> 28:50.645
(exhales)

28:52.105 --> 28:54.482
Dr. Lola Pell.
Chief endocrinologist

28:54.566 --> 28:55.984
at University of Chicago.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.527
I study hormones.

28:57.610 --> 28:58.653
Thank you for testifying,
Doctor.

28:58.736 --> 29:03.283
Now, the U.S. Olympic Committee
is using testosterone

29:03.366 --> 29:07.537
to decide who is a man
and who is a woman in sports.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.330
-What's your opinion of that?
-We're talking sex,

29:09.414 --> 29:12.292
-not gender, yes?
-BRICKNER: Well,
how are we describing

29:12.375 --> 29:13.835
-the difference?
-Sex is about

29:13.918 --> 29:16.379
the biological differences
between men and women.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.174
Gender is
about personal identity.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.718
Okay, I got it.
Uh, you can answer.

29:21.801 --> 29:25.513
Testosterone is a flawed way
to determine sex in sports.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.390
Trans women are born male.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.684
They've gone through
male puberty.

29:29.767 --> 29:32.312
As a result,
they have longer limbs,

29:32.395 --> 29:33.646
bigger heart and lungs,

29:33.730 --> 29:36.191
maybe even better muscle memory.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.567
In elite sports,

29:37.650 --> 29:40.361
just a one percent advantage

29:40.445 --> 29:42.363
can make a huge difference.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.200
So, even after lowering
someone's testosterone level,

29:45.283 --> 29:46.826
they still aren't
exactly playing

29:46.910 --> 29:50.288
on a level playing field
with women born as women?

29:50.371 --> 29:52.457
-Exactly.
-Thank you. Thank you.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.418
Dr. Pell, you've stated here

29:55.502 --> 29:59.506
that testosterone levels
are an imperfect gauge of sex.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.425
But can you identify
a better one?

30:05.470 --> 30:08.389
Given where we are
in medicine right now,

30:08.473 --> 30:09.766
no.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.727
NIA:
Thank you.

30:12.810 --> 30:15.438

Okay, counselors, anything else?

30:15.522 --> 30:18.441
-Okay, Liz...
-BRICKNER: Redirect?

30:18.525 --> 30:21.027
No. You do it.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.404
-Liz.
-You do it.

30:25.156 --> 30:28.409
Dr. Pell, you said

30:28.493 --> 30:30.912
that testosterone
is the most accurate

30:30.995 --> 30:32.497
and objective test of sex.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.082
What about genitalia?

30:34.165 --> 30:35.583
Wouldn't deciding based on that

30:35.667 --> 30:38.127
be just as accurate
and objective?

30:38.211 --> 30:41.631
Yes, it's an objective factor.

30:41.714 --> 30:44.634
And if the criteria
were genitalia,

30:44.717 --> 30:47.637
where would this new swimmer,
Sadie Lipton, land?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.264
On the men's team.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.640
Objection. Hypothetical.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.183
The question
has already been answered.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.935
I'm just trying to understand

30:54.018 --> 30:55.770
-what everybody is saying.
-ADRIAN: Your Honor,

30:55.853 --> 30:58.106
the transgender swimmer,
Sadie Lipton,

30:58.189 --> 31:00.108
has male genitalia.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.651
-Seriously?
-ADRIAN: Yeah.

31:01.734 --> 31:02.485
A penis?

31:02.569 --> 31:04.445
And he's swimming

31:04.529 --> 31:07.365
-as a woman?
-With all due respect,
Your Honor,

31:07.448 --> 31:09.576
Sadie Lipton is a woman

31:09.659 --> 31:11.744
and should be referred to
as "she."

31:11.828 --> 31:13.288
But she was a he?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.831
And now he...

31:14.914 --> 31:18.668
uh, she is swimming as a woman?

31:19.669 --> 31:21.337
The judge is on our side.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.630
Don't you think?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.632
Uh, it was effective.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.884
We're gonna win this.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.598
-What's going on?
-LEAH: It's a petition signed

31:31.681 --> 31:33.182
-by the associates.
-And the assistants.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.309
People are pissed off,

31:34.392 --> 31:38.354
so we decided to respectfully
express our displeasure

31:38.438 --> 31:40.648
with your smear
of a transgender swimmer.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.317

31:42.400 --> 31:44.110
-No more transphobia.
-(overlapping chatter)

31:44.193 --> 31:46.195
No more. It's not okay. No more.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.660
LEAH:
You're attacking
an oppressed minority.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.786
And we think Reddick/Boseman,

31:53.870 --> 31:55.455
of all firms,
should know better.

31:55.538 --> 31:57.790
-I understand.
-Then why are you doing it?

31:57.874 --> 32:00.460
Because it's a strategy.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.836
Hate isn't a strategy.

32:01.919 --> 32:04.005
-This is not hate.
-OPAL: You can't pit

32:04.088 --> 32:06.174
women's rights
against trans rights.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.010
There is an epidemic
of transgender violence.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.887
Especially women of color
getting attacked and murdered.

32:10.970 --> 32:14.140
Right. But Melanie Evers is
the victim in this instance.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.516
And we are fighting
for her rights

32:15.600 --> 32:17.685
because Melanie Evers
is our client.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.688
Now, here's
a young African American athlete

32:20.772 --> 32:23.316
who has worked her whole life
for this,

32:23.399 --> 32:25.485
and now someone just-just
takes it away from her?

32:25.568 --> 32:27.028
But I don't think that means
that we should...

32:27.111 --> 32:28.488

We-we-we appreciate your input,

32:32.325 --> 32:36.704
and we will take your opinions
into consideration.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.667
What we will not do
is abandon Melanie Evers

32:40.750 --> 32:42.835
or this case.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.883
We need to rethink.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.927
Why? Because of this?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.512
No.

32:52.595 --> 32:53.513

32:53.596 --> 32:55.515

32:55.598 --> 32:58.059
This is generational, Adrian.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.310
They get this better than we do.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.604
Liz, I've won awards
from organizations

33:01.688 --> 33:03.731
covering every one
of the letters

33:03.815 --> 33:07.026
-LGBTQ.
-And that is

33:07.110 --> 33:09.529
the transgender equivalent of
"I got a black friend."

33:09.612 --> 33:11.698
What are our options?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.908
You reframe
Melanie's case as a...

33:13.991 --> 33:15.702
a feminist issue.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.954
And we leave out
the anti-trans tone.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.997
That's, that's
the right approach.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.292
Not if it means we lose, Liz.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.586
Now, this is not about politics.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.255
This is about rules.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.424
Are the Olympic rules
fair or not?

33:29.507 --> 33:30.633
That's all.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.136
In life, that's never all.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.768

buying the Birkin.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.603

33:42.687 --> 33:44.439
I know the shopkeeper.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.566
I may have asked them
to give you a discount.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.817

I was four years old
when I first got in a pool,

40:31.720 --> 40:34.014
You've seen me
about a dozen times.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.516
-Where?
-In court.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.934
I'm a court stenographer.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.019
Oh, my gosh.
No, I do know you.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.147
-Yeah.
-(dog barking nearby)

40:44.775 --> 40:47.069
(door unlocking)

40:47.153 --> 40:48.070
Come on in.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.865
Oh, uh, wow.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.366
You're a bit of a collector.

40:52.449 --> 40:55.369
(sighs): Yeah, well,
I don't trust the Internet,

40:55.452 --> 40:57.413
only paper, so...

40:57.496 --> 41:00.708
This is every court case
I've ever worked on. (chuckles)

41:00.791 --> 41:02.543
And this is every court case

41:02.626 --> 41:04.044
from the rest of the courthouse.

41:04.128 --> 41:08.549
And the bedroom is 1998
through last year.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.218
(exhales sharply)
Why?

41:13.137 --> 41:15.514
Because someone
is burying cases.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.268
Memo 618?

41:24.273 --> 41:26.233
Do you know who?

41:27.484 --> 41:28.903
No. Do you?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.946
I might.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.866
Okay.

41:33.949 --> 41:37.494
I don't see any reason why
we can't work together.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.123
How do I know I can trust you?

41:41.207 --> 41:45.044
You can't, but...

41:45.127 --> 41:47.046
I'm trusting you.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.136
Okay, what do you want to know?

41:54.220 --> 41:55.930
Who is doing this?

41:56.013 --> 41:58.766
Memo 618.
Who's using it?

41:58.849 --> 42:02.770
The Office of Legal Counsel.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.146
The Department of Justice?

42:04.230 --> 42:06.565
Yes.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.442
How do you figure it?

every bit of B-roll I could find

43:55.424 --> 43:57.551
about the Office
of Legal Counsel.

43:57.634 --> 43:59.386
So, 1942,

43:59.470 --> 44:03.098
the OLC justified FDR signing
Executive Order 9066.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.892
Uh, the Japanese
internment camps?

44:04.975 --> 44:08.520
Yeah. Look at the bill
he signed.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.067
I don't see anything.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.902
I had to blow it up,
like, 50 times.

44:14.985 --> 44:17.905
This is Memo 618.

44:17.988 --> 44:22.409
In 2002, John Yoo of the OLC
drafted the "Torture Memos."

44:22.493 --> 44:24.912
But before those memos came out,

44:24.995 --> 44:29.124
this was Donald Rumsfeld
at a press conference.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.961
-What am I looking at?
-I got a lip reader.

44:33.045 --> 44:35.255
Look. Right there.
He's saying it.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.634
"We got it. Memo 618."

44:38.717 --> 44:42.388
Now, in 2019, Robert Mueller
insists a president

44:42.471 --> 44:43.931
can't be indicted.

44:44.014 --> 44:46.141
But there is never a law
anywhere that said that.

44:46.225 --> 44:49.812
Just an old memo
written by the OLC in 1973.

44:49.895 --> 44:52.940
It's never been reviewed, never
vetted in any court of law.

44:53.023 --> 44:57.111
And before Mueller reached
that decision, there was this.

44:59.029 --> 45:02.282
So, the same lip reader,
I got to do this, too.

45:02.366 --> 45:04.201
"Well, sir, are you worried?"

45:04.284 --> 45:07.621
"No, I have Memo 618
in my back pocket.

45:07.704 --> 45:10.082
I'm gonna be great.
I'm gonna be fine."

45:10.165 --> 45:12.084
So, what is it?

45:12.167 --> 45:15.295
What is Memo 618?

45:16.547 --> 45:20.300
Well, it's when the presidency
or Department of Justice knows

45:20.384 --> 45:23.095
they need a law, but it just
hasn't been drafted yet.

45:23.178 --> 45:24.596
So they know
they need an immediate order

45:24.680 --> 45:26.014
to get what they want.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.182
FDR knows

45:27.266 --> 45:29.184
he wants
to imprison Japanese-Americans,

45:29.268 --> 45:31.687
Bush knows he needs
to torture, uh,

45:31.770 --> 45:33.647
Trump knew he wanted
to not be indicted.

45:33.730 --> 45:35.149
And they all knew
that eventually

45:35.232 --> 45:37.818
they were gonna need a law
to support it, but

45:37.901 --> 45:41.864
in the meantime,
there's Memo 618.

45:47.119 --> 45:49.455
MAN:
All rise.

45:54.042 --> 45:56.044
(sighs)

45:57.254 --> 45:59.173
To be honest, I'm torn.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.676
Ms. Evers, Ms. Lipton, clearly

46:02.759 --> 46:05.179
you're both extraordinary
young athletes,

46:05.262 --> 46:09.975
both disciplined, talented.

46:10.058 --> 46:12.227
Nobody could ask you
to work any harder than you do.

46:12.311 --> 46:14.646
But the law is clear,

46:14.730 --> 46:17.024
and rules are rules.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.902
Ms. Lipton is eligible
to compete,

46:19.985 --> 46:23.197
-and the plaintiff's motion
is denied.
-(crying)

46:23.280 --> 46:25.032
(bangs gavel)

46:25.115 --> 46:27.159
(crying)

46:32.915 --> 46:35.542
So you agree, I should move
some of my supply chain

46:35.626 --> 46:37.044
-to the Caymans?
-100%.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.546
-Good. You'll make it happen?
-Today.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.675
And, of course, there are
significant tax benefits.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.094
-I'll leave that to you.
-(chuckles)

46:46.178 --> 46:50.891
Mm-hmm.
So I heard you were showing

46:50.974 --> 46:52.893
my colleague some
of the finer things in life.

46:52.976 --> 46:56.396
Lucca. Yes. She told you?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.398
Yes, your little card game.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.776
Mm-hmm. She cleaned up.

47:00.859 --> 47:03.695
Isn't that fantastic? (laughs)

47:03.779 --> 47:05.739
Well, it would be

47:05.822 --> 47:08.909
if she ever got the money.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.411
-I'm sorry. What?
-Uh, nothing.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.955
I'm probably
speaking out of turn.

47:13.038 --> 47:14.831
She hasn't been paid yet?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.460
Zara, what are you saying?

47:18.544 --> 47:21.255
Why didn't the check go out?

47:21.338 --> 47:24.258
Get her the cash now.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.218
Geraldine.

47:26.301 --> 47:29.638
Oh, don't you worry,
I am calling Tee next.

47:29.721 --> 47:30.889
Okay, here's the deal.

47:30.973 --> 47:33.267
Either you pay Lucca today,

47:33.350 --> 47:36.728
or I start adding a ten grand
late fee every day.

47:36.812 --> 47:37.771
(sighs)

47:37.855 --> 47:40.065
I'm taking care of it.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.235
(laughs)

47:43.318 --> 47:45.195
(both laugh)

47:48.323 --> 47:49.992
There's something
I want to show you.

47:50.075 --> 47:53.161
Adrian. Adrian.

47:55.914 --> 47:58.959
-You should look at this.
-What is it?

47:59.042 --> 48:00.961
Some of Sadie's teammates
went to a private doctor

48:01.044 --> 48:03.797
to test their testosterone
to help her in her case.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.466
I got this from the doctor.

48:10.596 --> 48:11.805
How'd you get this?

48:11.888 --> 48:13.640
I'd rather not say.

48:14.683 --> 48:15.934
There.

48:25.819 --> 48:26.987
We just learned
that there's another swimmer

48:27.070 --> 48:28.905
on the Olympic team
with testosterone levels

48:28.989 --> 48:30.991
-above the limit.
-Which one?

48:31.074 --> 48:32.326
Piper Vega?

48:32.409 --> 48:35.162
No way. Piper's not trans.

48:35.245 --> 48:37.789
I-I would know, I'm like
a mentor. We-we train together.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.167
ADRIAN:
It's not about being trans.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.877
We have the test results,
Melanie.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.881
Are you willing
to go back to court?

48:45.964 --> 48:49.051
Even if it means that Piper
gets kicked off the team?

48:53.889 --> 48:56.350
Why didn't you tell me
you hadn't been paid?

48:56.433 --> 48:57.934
(laughs):
I feel like an idiot.

48:58.018 --> 49:00.646
-It's-it's okay.
-It's not okay.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.148
David filled me in.

49:03.231 --> 49:04.650
Thank you, David.

49:04.733 --> 49:05.651
Actually, I'm glad
he said something

49:05.734 --> 49:06.818
because you were never going to.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.862
I meant to bring it up
at dinner.

49:08.945 --> 49:11.031
But you didn't for some reason?

49:11.114 --> 49:13.533
I don't understand
what's going on.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.661
Suddenly you're tongue-tied,
you're hesitant.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.663
I mean, I know our friendship
is, like, ten minutes old,

49:17.746 --> 49:19.665
but I don't think this is you.

49:19.748 --> 49:21.875
It's not. Usually.

49:21.958 --> 49:25.921
I have no trouble talking about
my clients' money, obviously.

49:26.004 --> 49:30.550
But my own?
It just, it-it feels... wrong.

49:30.634 --> 49:34.262
(chuckles):
Well... get over it.

49:36.098 --> 49:37.224
I don't think I can.

49:37.974 --> 49:43.105
We're friends,
and you have this...

49:43.188 --> 49:45.190
wealth, and it's...

49:45.273 --> 49:49.903
uncomfortable to talk about
or ask about or anything about.

49:49.986 --> 49:52.447
-It's just money.
-Not to people

49:52.531 --> 49:55.450
who don't have it.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.453
Money defines people.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.956
I can't do what you do

50:01.039 --> 50:04.960
or go where you go
or buy what you buy.

50:05.043 --> 50:06.461
That's the great divide.

50:06.545 --> 50:09.381
And it's hard to get over.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.138
-I'm on your side.
-I know.

50:16.221 --> 50:19.099
And I want to be on yours.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.231
Dr. Pell, have you had a chance

50:26.314 --> 50:29.776
to go over the medical records
of Piper Vega?

50:29.860 --> 50:30.902
PELL:
I have.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.155
ADRIAN: What were her
testosterone numbers, please?

50:33.238 --> 50:38.118
She was tested twice.
One was 11.6, one was 12.3.

50:38.201 --> 50:42.914
And the allowable limit
for Olympic eligibility is 10,

50:42.998 --> 50:45.959
-correct?
-Yes. No more than 10.

50:46.042 --> 50:48.754
ADRIAN:
Doctor, what's the basis of
putting a cap on testosterone?

50:48.837 --> 50:51.465
Higher numbers
provide advantages

50:51.548 --> 50:53.967
in athletic performance
related to speed

50:54.050 --> 50:56.344
-and strength.
-Thank you.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.180
Dr. Pell, these advantages
that you speak of,

50:58.263 --> 50:59.514
do they apply to Piper Vega?

50:59.598 --> 51:01.433
No. Piper has a condition

51:01.516 --> 51:06.438
known as complete androgen
insensitivity syndrome.

51:06.521 --> 51:09.483
While the testosterone levels
are that of a cis male,

51:09.566 --> 51:12.652
the testosterone itself
isn't absorbed,

51:12.736 --> 51:16.156
thus provide none
of the relevant benefits.

51:16.239 --> 51:19.534
Uh, counselors, can you approach
the bench, please?

51:22.454 --> 51:26.666
Um, am I understanding that...

51:26.750 --> 51:30.420
Piper Vega is biologically male?

51:30.504 --> 51:34.674
No. All her external secondary
traits are female,

51:34.758 --> 51:36.343
she presents as female,

51:36.426 --> 51:39.179
but her chromosomes are male.

51:39.262 --> 51:41.306
Then what is she?

51:41.389 --> 51:44.351
Clinically, she'd be
classified as intersex.

51:44.434 --> 51:47.521
And does she know that she'd
be classified as that?

51:47.604 --> 51:49.523
As far as we know, Your Honor,
she does not know.

51:49.606 --> 51:53.944
Then I'm assuming
she has female genitalia?

51:54.027 --> 51:55.403
She does.

51:58.490 --> 52:00.659
Any more questions, Counselor?

52:00.742 --> 52:02.536
-I do, Your Honor.
-Okay.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.496
Well, proceed.

52:08.500 --> 52:12.254
Dr. Pell,
you testified previously

52:12.337 --> 52:15.298
that, imperfect
though they may be,

52:15.382 --> 52:17.843
testosterone levels
provide the most accurate

52:17.926 --> 52:20.595
and objective determination
of sex identity

52:20.679 --> 52:24.891
for purposes
of athletic competition.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.561
Is that still the case?

52:27.644 --> 52:30.397
-Yes.
-LIZ: Your Honor,

52:30.480 --> 52:33.400
the International Olympic
Committee, uh, has established

52:33.483 --> 52:36.570
these regulations by which
they now must abide.

52:36.653 --> 52:40.240
It gives me no satisfaction
to argue that this young woman

52:40.323 --> 52:43.577
should be disqualified
from the Olympic team.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.579
(exhales)

52:45.662 --> 52:47.706
(grunts)

52:47.789 --> 52:50.542
Ain't science great?

52:50.625 --> 52:54.588
I'm sitting up here listening
to doctors give expert testimony

52:54.671 --> 52:56.756
about things
I barely understand,

52:56.840 --> 53:00.719
and just because I'm wearing
this black nightgown,

53:00.802 --> 53:04.681
I get to decide
which girl's heart gets broken.

53:04.764 --> 53:06.975
I mean, d-does anybody else
want this job?

53:07.058 --> 53:10.645
Because I sure as hell don't.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.608
Piper Vega, I'm sorry.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.902
You are a lovely young woman

53:16.985 --> 53:20.739
and I hope you find happiness
in your life,

53:20.822 --> 53:24.659
but unfortunately you're...
you're not gonna find it here.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.579
Melanie Evers,
I'm guessing that during

53:27.662 --> 53:32.250
all those cold, early-morning
workouts with your mother,

53:32.334 --> 53:36.630
this is not how you imagined
you'd be going to the Olympics,

53:36.713 --> 53:40.675
but based on standards
that were set by some entity

53:40.759 --> 53:45.597
in some far-off place,
you'll be going.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.515
We stand adjourned.

53:53.521 --> 53:55.440
LUCCA:
David.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.819
Thank you.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.321
For?

54:01.404 --> 54:03.448
Telling Bianca.
I never thought...

54:03.531 --> 54:05.033
Lucca.

54:05.116 --> 54:09.663
When you have money, I get
ten percent for managing it.

54:09.746 --> 54:12.832
That's the only reason
I did that.

54:20.590 --> 54:22.509
-I'm in.
-FRANK: You are?

54:22.592 --> 54:24.844
1,000%.

54:24.928 --> 54:27.055
What about that issue you had?

54:27.138 --> 54:30.308
Ah, I took care of it.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.519
Are you sure?

54:32.602 --> 54:35.522
Frank...
(laughs)

54:35.605 --> 54:37.691
the issue's gone.

54:37.774 --> 54:39.651
We should celebrate.

54:39.734 --> 54:41.778
Anybody feel like a Scotch?

54:41.861 --> 54:44.447
(dog barking in distance)
