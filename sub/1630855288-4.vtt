WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.586
Previously on
Cruel Summer...

00:02.586 --> 00:05.005
You would be okay
if I hooked up with Luke?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.632
Megan:
Yeah, go for it.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.592
As soon as Principal Bowers
finds out it's me on the tape,

00:08.592 --> 00:10.552
they're gonna revoke
my scholarship.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.387
Everyone already believes
they saw me on that tape,

00:12.387 --> 00:13.972
so let's make sure
that it stays that way.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.515
-So you think Brent
made the tape?
-Who else?

00:18.227 --> 00:19.686
Is it the only tape?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.480
-Yes.
-That's a lie.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.233
-Luke: Are you okay?
-I just feel like
an animal in a zoo.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.777
Let 'em talk.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.571
Hey, just so you know,
I'm still going to have
a job while I'm at school,

00:29.571 --> 00:30.739
so I'll be able to help out.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.408
No, I want you to enjoy college.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.036
Take your foot off the gas
a little, let loose.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.871
Let me be the adult
for a change.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.748
Sheriff:
This is security footage.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.668
No sign of either your car
or Luke coming home.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.919
No comment.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.170
Can you explain to me

00:45.170 --> 00:46.964
why your fingerprints
were on the gun?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.800
Did you want revenge on him
for breaking your heart?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.094
(modem beeping and buzzing)

01:07.276 --> 01:10.779
(upbeat music playing)

01:10.779 --> 01:13.490
We do the same thing
every summer.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.367
Go to the marina,
hang out at the cove.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.828
-Lather, rinse, repeat.
-That's a problem?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.746
Well, there's no surprises
in Chatham.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.124
I want to change things up,

01:22.124 --> 01:24.626
live on the edge.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.587
Like...?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.589
I don't know. (laughs)

01:28.589 --> 01:32.759
I'm just tired of being
Megan Landry,

01:32.759 --> 01:35.387
boring, responsible
Honor student.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.347
You want to be a bad girl?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.766
Not like committing crimes
bad, but...

01:39.766 --> 01:44.646
more like taking risks
and going on adventures.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.857
Being... unpredictable.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.443
You don't have to convince me.
Unpredictable's my brand.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.446
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

01:52.446 --> 01:55.407
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah! (echoing) ♪

02:01.872 --> 02:04.333
I just read the coolest article
about White Hat hackers.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.043
Is that like a fashion thing?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.878
Funny.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.172
Basically, they look
for security holes

02:10.172 --> 02:13.133
in big companies' systems
and fix them before
hackers can get in.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.510
That's... cool.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.513
And the guy in the article went
to my same program at U Dub.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.099
It's something that I could do
in college to make money.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.477
It pays really well
so I could help out
even more with Mom and Lily.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.689
Are you gonna see Luke later?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.232
(metal clangs, water splashes)

02:29.232 --> 02:30.734
-Debbie: Crap!
-What was that?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.867
(Debbie groans)

02:38.867 --> 02:41.370
-Do you want me
to shut off the valve?
-I already did.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.871
Hopefully it'll stop soon.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.790
-What happened?
-Ah!

02:44.790 --> 02:47.501
Old pipes.
Guess they just gave out.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.754
I'll call the plumber.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.005
Debbie:
Thanks.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.173
Another bill.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.496
(electricity squelching)

04:11.835 --> 04:14.713
Tom: You said you took
Luke home, but we all know
now that you didn't.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.090
So where did you go?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.302
We drove around for a while.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.639
Where did you end up?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.062
The cabin.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.731
The murder site.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.941
Great.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.985
Would've been nice
to mention that.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.323
-(Smash Mouth
playing "All Star")
-Jeff: Ooh!

04:41.323 --> 04:42.532
(laughing)

04:42.532 --> 04:45.452
Luke:
I still got it, I still got it.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.204
-Jeff: Oh, man.
-We're getting good.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.914
Megan:
Guys, come here.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.583
I want to go
somewhere different tonight.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.793
Someplace fun.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.878
Well, Woodstock would be cool

04:54.878 --> 04:56.671
if it wasn't 3,000 miles away.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.590
We could go to a club.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.801
Um, well, the closest thing
we have to a club

05:00.801 --> 05:03.136
would be the Brownsville Pub,
but that's a dive bar.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.346
Do they card?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.056
Yeah, I mean, it's a bar,

05:06.056 --> 05:07.599
so you have to be 21
to get in.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.309
That's dumb.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.395
I mean, most countries
don't even have a drinking age.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.816
Brent has a fake ID,
but he'd never let me use it.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.611
Jeff:
I'm pretty good at Photoshop.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.988
Maybe I could
figure something out.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.824
You want to make fake IDs?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.535
Why not?

05:26.535 --> 05:29.746
You're the computer genius,
maybe you could help.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.623
Uh...

05:31.623 --> 05:34.584
I don't know,
it's kind of risky.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.211
Exactly.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.342
Okay. Yeah. Let's do it.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.220
You're in?

05:49.641 --> 05:51.518
plumber: Yeah, let me know
when you have the money,

05:51.518 --> 05:52.853
then I'll schedule
the crew, okay?

05:52.853 --> 05:53.728
Debbie:
Thank you.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.232
(groans)

05:59.484 --> 06:02.153
-(exhales sharply) 6,000.
-(Megan scoffs)

06:02.153 --> 06:04.322
And he wants payment
in full up front.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.452
Um, okay.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.246
We can tap the emergency fund?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.583
It's gone.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.668
Between the roof last year
and Lily's retainer,

06:16.668 --> 06:18.295
the fund's empty.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.881
I can't get another loan
from the bank.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.048
Why didn't you tell me?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.301
I didn't want to stress you out.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.303
Okay, you can't
have it both ways.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.929
You can't lean on me
to help pay for things

06:27.929 --> 06:29.723
and then keep me in the dark.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.766
I mean,
for once, it would be nice

06:31.766 --> 06:33.226
if you were
the grown-up around here.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.651
I have like $900
in my savings account.

06:41.651 --> 06:45.739
That is for college.
I'll talk to Steve.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.950
Megan: We can't ask him for help
every time something goes wrong.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.744
-(door closes)
-He's your boss.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.704
It was bad enough before,
it's ten times weirder

06:52.704 --> 06:55.290
now that you're
in a relationship with him,
and I'm dating Luke.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.209
I don't like it any more
than you do, but I don't
know what else to do.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.711
I can help.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.505
It's $5,000.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.717
Where'd you get that?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.636
My parents.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.513
They gave me money so that I can
buy myself a Christmas present,

07:10.513 --> 07:11.681
but...

07:14.559 --> 07:15.852
I want you to have it.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.812
That's incredibly generous,
honey--

07:17.812 --> 07:20.482
But we can't take it.

07:20.482 --> 07:24.194
Look, there's nothing else that
I'd rather spend my money on.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.570
You guys are family to me.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.782
So are you.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.241
In all the best ways.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.663
But we will find a way.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.665
We always do.

07:36.665 --> 07:41.169
Yeah. In the meantime,
we can't stay here tonight,
so pack a bag.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.672
I'm sure Steve
will let us stay with him
till we sort it all out.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.808
Okay.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.102
What town do you want
to be from?

07:57.102 --> 07:59.813
Hmm, Seattle.
That's where U Dub is.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.398
Where I hope I'll be next year.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.692
Where do you want to go?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.360
Film school,

08:05.360 --> 08:10.490
so USC or NYU.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.035
All the great directors
went to one or the other.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.955
George Lucas, Spike Lee.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.665
It's cool how
into filmmaking you are.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.169
People mostly
don't understand it,

08:23.169 --> 08:24.921
but it makes me happy.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.007
I get to create
my own little world.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.760
Check it out.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.140
(laughs) Wow.
That looks amazing.

08:35.140 --> 08:40.228
The watermark is missing,
but it's impossible to copy.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.107
We'll see about that.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.290
Whoa.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.333
How did you do that?

09:02.333 --> 09:06.254
(laughs) Being a computer nerd
has its advantages.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.506
I get to create
my own little world.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.844
There is nothing nerdy
about you.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.345
You're amazing.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.930
(computer chimes)

09:27.734 --> 09:30.361
Okay, work your magic.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.868
We make a pretty awesome team.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.667
Megan, this is real life,
it is not fiction.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.669
But, yeah, it doesn't look good.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.091
When was the last time
you saw Luke?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.512
Early that Saturday morning.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.806
And you haven't been back
to the cabin since then?

09:58.973 --> 10:01.101
No.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.686
Is there anything else about
that night you haven't told me?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.232
Hmm-mm.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.275
Are you sure?

10:09.275 --> 10:12.695
Because we cannot afford
any more surprises.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.406
I need to be prepared
for whatever is coming.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.911
No, that's it.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.095
I wish I could rewind
to that night and not see
my mom kissing my dad.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.805
Don't waste
another second on it.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.266
When something bad happens,
put it in the rear view,

10:41.266 --> 10:42.475
move forward.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.102
So, like, denial?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.355
I mean, it's worked
for me so far.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.860
Look, tonight
is gonna be amazing.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.529
You and Jeff are crazy cute.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.949
He's excellent at Photoshop.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.410
That may be one of the geekiest
things I've ever heard.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.203
(laughing) I know, I know.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.873
But I feel like I can really
be myself around him.

11:04.873 --> 11:05.790
Like I can with Luke.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.170
Can I borrow this?

11:11.921 --> 11:12.964
Of course.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.220
Debbie:
It's just one night.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.472
I really, really
don't want to go.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.225
I just don't want
to be around Brent right now.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.352
Not after everything
with the tape...

11:26.352 --> 11:28.271
I'm so sorry.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.690
He had no right to do
that to you.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.360
Sex is supposed to be private.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.112
Not blasted out in public.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.073
Yeah.
In front of the whole town.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.579
You could've told me, y'know.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.416
That you and Luke
were having sex.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.169
Your first time...

11:52.462 --> 11:53.504
that's special.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.841
It was.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.888
Ohh... that tape...

12:01.888 --> 12:04.766
I can't believe you saw that.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.684
I wish there was
something I could do

12:06.684 --> 12:08.186
to make it all disappear.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.854
Me too.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.067
Thank you.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.444
For not making me
feel worse about it.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.784
Isabella:
Name?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.619
Raymond Chandler.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.454
So proud of that. (giggles)

12:26.454 --> 12:28.081
Isabella:
When were you born, Ray?

12:28.081 --> 12:32.043
Uh... February 5th, 1978.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.294
Where?

12:33.294 --> 12:35.838
(clicks tongue)
Fresno, California.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.050
But I live in L. A. now.
It's where the work is.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.094
Hmm-mm. Don't improvise.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
If you say too much,
it sounds like you're lying.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.973
Watch this.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.725
Hi, I'm Rob Ludlum,
born in Ames, Iowa.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.519
May 28th, 1977.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.271
I like fast cars
and beautiful women.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.855
What did she just say?

12:52.855 --> 12:55.108
I'm just, I'm trying to add
some personality to it.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.777
Just take it.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.488
I am Liz George
from Seattle, Washington.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.407
Born June 25th, 1978.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.827
That's how it's done, boys.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.995
There you go.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.663
(Megan giggles)

13:08.663 --> 13:10.206
What about you?

13:10.206 --> 13:13.376
Yeah, Patty Highsmith does not
need a dress rehearsal.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.086
Okay?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.130
They look so real.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.923
You're the Photoshop master.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.717
Thanks, Liz.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.969
Isabella:
All right, go time.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.018
-Everyone remember what
you're supposed to say, okay?
-Megan: Yep.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.068
So, we're just gonna smile
and pretend

13:39.068 --> 13:41.362
that the Christmas party
and the tape never happened.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.531
Should give us, like,
nothing to talk about.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.283
There's always the weather.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.870
Yeah, cloudy with a chance
of "Brent's a total douchebag."

13:48.870 --> 13:50.371
You should've taken the money.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.418
Wait, Megan, I was joking.
I just...

13:55.418 --> 13:57.420
I don't know, I feel like
it shouldn't be complicated.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.758
I know, but...
money is always complicated.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.301
-(doorbell rings)
-Right.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.764
Hi. Hey.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.266
Thanks so much, Steve,
we really appreciate it.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.018
Isabella.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.856
-No Lily?
-She's at Olivia's
for a sleepover.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.150
(softly) We're sneaking you into
my room later for a sleepover.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.527
Uh... Brent!

14:21.527 --> 14:24.322
Come downstairs
and welcome your guests, please.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.836
I don't know, he's, uh,
otherwise occupied or something.
Please make yourselves at home.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.427
Hey. Are you okay?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.554
Um...

14:48.554 --> 14:50.098
Yeah.

14:50.098 --> 14:53.309
Uh... Wayne Bright pulled out
of the Northland deal.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.104
What? Why?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.730
Because he said
he can't do business

14:57.730 --> 15:00.399
with people
that don't share his values.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.027
That tape.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.156
-You had nothing to do with--
-It doesn't matter, it's done.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.242
And when someone like that
spikes a deal,

15:09.242 --> 15:13.246
it sends a message to other
potential investors, so...

15:13.246 --> 15:14.747
we're dead in the water.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.682
FYI, Brent's on the warpath.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.268
My dad's making him work for him
next semester instead
of going to school.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.936
Really? 'Cause of the tape?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.438
Yeah. I told you
I was gonna get it handled.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.232
God, talk about
a Christmas miracle.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.404
Can I use your shower?
I was going to
before the pipes burst.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.823
Yeah, of course. The clean
towels are in my bathroom,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.992
and Alma made up guest beds
for you guys.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.870
She also made those
crispy potatoes that you love.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.538
Oh my God. Wait, really?

15:55.538 --> 15:56.914
Luke:
Yeah.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.416
I missed those.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.001
Luke:
She said to tell you hi.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.335
Isabella:
That's very sweet.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.046
(dance music playing)

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
-bouncer: Have a good night.
-Thanks!

16:16.434 --> 16:17.393
Hey.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.646
That was so easy!

16:20.646 --> 16:22.565
Be cool. And breathe.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.904
Wait.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.822
May 28th...
what's your sign?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.949
My sign?

16:31.949 --> 16:35.620
Yeah, like the Zodiac.
Your sign, dude.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.871
Um...

16:36.871 --> 16:38.915
Beat it, kid.
Your sidekick too.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.225
Okay, they're ready for us.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.032
That's the letter Luke sent
to his dad

17:15.076 --> 17:16.577
saying he was running away,

17:16.577 --> 17:18.287
going to see family
in Virginia.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.335
We found your fingerprints
on it.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.671
You always said you didn't know
Luke was planning to leave.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.214
So how do you explain this?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.512
Um...

17:34.512 --> 17:36.806
Luke told me
that he was running away.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.309
And yet you never mentioned it,
in all the times I asked.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.103
-I was protecting him.
-By lying.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.689
-Sheriff...
-You've lied about
dropping him off at home,

17:44.689 --> 17:47.316
you lied about knowing
he was leaving,
and now the letter.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.777
How about you start telling
the truth?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.113
Why did Luke run away?

17:52.113 --> 17:54.115
I don't know.
He was scared.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.283
-Of what?
-I don't know.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.617
-Of who?
-We're done here.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.661
Feels more like we're
just getting started.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.289
If you want to question
my client any further, you have
to place her under arrest.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.886
Let's go.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.963
(dance music playing)

18:56.427 --> 18:59.722
It smells like sweat and beer,
but, like, in a good way.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.057
(giggles)

19:01.057 --> 19:02.600
I guess the guys got busted.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.185
Their loss.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.436
Well, should we...?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.063
Hell no.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.857
-Come on. Let's go.
-(giggles)

19:13.944 --> 19:15.905
This is even better
than I expected.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.199
Louder. Cooler. More...

19:18.199 --> 19:20.326
everything. (giggles)

19:20.326 --> 19:21.702
Cuba Libre, please.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.954
Wanna make that two?

19:23.954 --> 19:25.581
Yeah.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.832
Yeah. Yeah, she'd love one.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.544
I would?

19:30.544 --> 19:33.339
You don't have to drink it.
Just hold it.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.465
It'll make you look old.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.675
Okay?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.346
Already taken care of.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.811
Eww, he's, like, 30!

19:46.811 --> 19:48.688
And sweaty.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.231
In all the wrong ways.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.357
(laughs)

19:51.357 --> 19:52.858
Thank you.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.652
(laughing)

19:56.070 --> 19:57.738
Wait, what's in this?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.156
Rum and Coke. With lime.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.785
It was the first drink
I had with Lisa.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.370
We were in Barcelona.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.622
My God, we thought that we were,
like, so sophisticated.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.582
-Hemingway used to drink them.
-Really?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.126
I love The Sun Also Rises.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.672
It should be mine too. With you.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.924
To firsts.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.725
All right, come on,
I love this song.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.416
Five grand. In cash.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.419
She just whipped it out
like it was no big deal,
like it was nothing to her.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.921
She was trying to help.
It came from a good place.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.466
I mean, I know.
I know, but...

20:58.466 --> 20:59.842
I don't know,
it just felt awkward,

20:59.842 --> 21:02.344
like we're charity
or something.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.848
Come on, that's
the last thing she intended.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.601
How do you know?

21:09.977 --> 21:11.771
We talked about it.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.189
Behind my back?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.941
No. No, it was
nothing like that.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.277
She felt bad,
she wanted a friendly ear.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.362
We talk sometimes--
it's no big deal.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.739
You talk about me?

21:21.739 --> 21:24.575
(laughs) Megan,
we talk about everything.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.827
We're friends, all right?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.079
Yeah.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.665
Can you try
not to worry so much?

21:31.665 --> 21:33.334
It's all gonna work out.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.961
(scoffs) No, it's not, but okay.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.254
You sound like Isabella.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.466
-What did I do?
-Nothing, nothing.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.092
You didn't do anything.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.677
I guess I just shouldn't expect
either of you to understand.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.645
I work my ass off for a year
waiting tables.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.397
And then a pipe bursts, and
in seconds, that money's gone.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.150
And it's not even enough
for the repair.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.777
I get it.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.403
How?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.781
A window gets smashed here
and it's fixed overnight,

22:03.781 --> 22:05.699
like nothing happened--
it's the same for Isabella.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.827
If something goes wrong, then
somebody just writes a check.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.580
What's going on?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.207
Nothing.
Nothing, just forget it.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.507
(patrons chatting)

22:25.219 --> 22:27.805
They're really gonna leave us
out here in the cold?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.849
It's like 70 degrees.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.519
This one's on you, dude.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.145
You never could take direction.

22:37.648 --> 22:38.732
Whatever.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.488
What are we supposed to do now?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.198
Nothing.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.575
We wait.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.829
So, you, um...

22:53.581 --> 22:56.166
You and Megan been...

22:56.166 --> 22:57.167
hanging out?

22:58.961 --> 23:00.004
Yeah.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.508
We used her computer
for the IDs.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.344
She has a great set-up.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.930
I mean, I knew that she
was good with all that,

23:09.930 --> 23:13.058
but seeing her in action...

23:13.058 --> 23:14.268
she's got mad skills.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.855
To you, maybe.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.065
You suck at numbers.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.860
I'm dyslexic, you moron.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.446
And you still
copied off me in math.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.366
I got pretty good grades too.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.492
(laughing)

23:34.914 --> 23:38.375
Hey, man, it's cool
that you and Megan are...

23:38.375 --> 23:41.670
you know, hanging out or...

23:41.670 --> 23:42.880
whatever.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.881
For real.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.999
Hey, what are you doing in here?

24:18.999 --> 24:21.335
I was just, um...

24:21.335 --> 24:22.795
I was just seeing
if you had any more tapes.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.802
I wondered
what happened to this.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.553
Where'd you find it?

24:31.553 --> 24:33.722
Uh, Luke's bathroom closet.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.349
Hmm.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.142
Must've gotten mixed up
in the laundry.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.769
Find anything else?

24:38.769 --> 24:41.522
No.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.606
When did you leave it there?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.694
I don't know.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.362
Some time last summer, probably.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.613
Probably or definitely?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.577
Wait, I'm sorry, what...
What are you getting at?

24:58.664 --> 25:00.541
No.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.292
No, Megan, this is from before.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.966
Look, um, if there's
been some overlap,

25:08.966 --> 25:10.884
or if you still have feelings
for Luke or something,

25:10.884 --> 25:12.094
you should tell me
and I'll deal.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.055
Are you really asking me that?

25:16.223 --> 25:17.641
Yeah, I guess I am.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.816
You know...

25:25.816 --> 25:30.654
I've let this whole town call me
a slut and a lousy friend.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.032
Everywhere I go, people whisper
behind my back,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.367
all so that you could keep
your scholarship.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.369
And now you think I'm sneaking
around with Luke?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.371
-Really, Megan?
-I'm sorry, I just...

25:39.371 --> 25:41.498
The stuff with the pipes has me
so stressed out, I'm--

25:41.498 --> 25:43.125
I don't care.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.210
How far do I need to go
to prove my loyalty to you?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.467
When what?

25:51.467 --> 25:52.801
Do you need me to kill for you?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.347
Isabella, I...

26:08.442 --> 26:10.194
-Megan: Oh, thank you.
-Isabella: Thank you.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.204
Uh! That burns.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.247
Yeah. You get used to it.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.832
My old boyfriend and I
used to do body shots.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.292
-What's that?
-So basically,

26:25.292 --> 26:28.087
you lick the person's neck,
then you put salt on it,

26:28.087 --> 26:30.214
and then they take a shot,
hold it in their mouth,

26:30.214 --> 26:32.299
and then you kiss,
lick their salty neck,

26:32.299 --> 26:34.426
so that way
you both get the shot.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.595
Ooh! That sounds sexy.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.888
And kind of disgusting.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.473
-Exactly.
-(laughs)

26:39.473 --> 26:41.016
I'm gonna get some water.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.525
Can I get a water? Thanks.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.950
♪ It makes me sick to see
that you don't trust me ♪

26:57.950 --> 27:01.870
♪ When deep inside you know
I hold you dear ♪

27:01.870 --> 27:05.707
♪ I wanna spend my time making
love under the covers... ♪

27:08.794 --> 27:10.796
Hey! We have to go!

27:10.796 --> 27:12.881
-No way, it's too early.
-Now. Sheriff Myer's here.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.759
Come on.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.678
This is a big game,
I'm really counting on 'em...

27:24.142 --> 27:25.602
Heard you're grounded.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.523
Yep.
Thanks to my pitiful snitch
of a brother.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.775
Oh, right, 'cause it's my fault
you did all that pervy shit?

27:31.775 --> 27:34.194
Newsflash, dildo--
it's all your fault.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.280
"Dildo." That's new.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.284
Oh, hey, movie star.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.411
Can you try not to be
an asshole?

27:42.411 --> 27:43.912
That's literally impossible
for him.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.622
You're a frigging predator.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.833
Oh, I love it
when you call me names.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.210
It is super hot.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.421
-You wish.
-Megan: Are you serious?

27:52.421 --> 27:54.673
I used to think
this whole thing was an act,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.426
that you were just super
damaged and overcompensating.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.344
But I am done
making excuses for you.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.388
You've gone too far this time.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.891
God, when are you guys
gonna get over this?
It's not that big of a deal.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.517
Are you for real?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.895
You should be lucky you're not
going to jail right now, Brent.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.063
Get off your high horse,
you slut.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.482
-Slut?
-I mean, if you hadn't been
looking for sloppy seconds

28:12.482 --> 28:14.902
and banging Luke behind
Megan's back, none of this...

28:14.902 --> 28:17.112
-Hey! Hey!
-...none of this
would have happened.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.282
Enough. Sit down.
Sit down.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.248
(clears throat)

28:35.547 --> 28:37.174
Let's try to have a nice meal.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.181
(rock music on headset)

28:49.186 --> 28:52.189
You knew Luke was running away
and you never said a word?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.608
How could you let Steve
suffer like that?

29:00.238 --> 29:01.615
I was...

29:01.615 --> 29:04.493
I was trying to protect Luke.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.911
Was he in some kind of trouble?

29:07.245 --> 29:09.539
He was really freaked out.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.874
He wouldn't tell me much,

29:10.874 --> 29:13.377
just that he had to get away
for a while.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.052
I wish you would have told me.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.471
This is too much for you
to carry on your own.

29:30.560 --> 29:35.273
Luke showed me the letter
when we were at the cabin.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.651
I was supposed to put it
in Steve's mailbox

29:37.651 --> 29:40.988
after I dropped him off
at the train station.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.573
When I got back to the cabin
after work...

29:46.243 --> 29:47.369
he wasn't there.

29:49.287 --> 29:52.165
For months after he left,

29:52.165 --> 29:54.835
every time the phone rang,

29:54.835 --> 29:56.336
I thought it was going
to be him.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.485
I think Brent owes Isabella
an apology.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.903
And Luke too.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.533
Okay.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.535
Brent, come on.

30:31.538 --> 30:32.706
I'm sorry.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.670
It was wrong, what I did.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.382
Feel free to keep going.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.718
Megan, he apologized.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.970
Some genuine remorse
would be nice.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.015
Uh, hey, let's just
have a nice dinner.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.392
-Yes, I agree.
-(Megan scoffs)

30:52.392 --> 30:54.269
No. No, not until Brent admits

30:54.269 --> 30:56.229
that he filmed girls
without telling them.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.148
Do we have to do this now, here?

30:58.148 --> 31:00.984
Wait...
there's more than one tape?

31:00.984 --> 31:03.695
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's quite the filmmaker.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.988
You must be so proud.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.198
Excuse me?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.532
Did you know?

31:10.327 --> 31:11.620
I found out
a couple days ago, yeah.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.250
Your mother...

31:17.250 --> 31:19.461
your mother would be
so ashamed of you.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.921
Debbie.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.756
I can't believe
you're not more upset.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.424
Okay, you know what?

31:24.424 --> 31:27.344
Brent made a serious lapse
in judgment,

31:27.344 --> 31:29.221
and he has been punished.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.014
End of story.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.600
He filmed these kids
without their knowledge, Steve,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.560
without their consent.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.106
That is more than a lapse
in judgment, that is criminal.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.067
I need you
to not question my parenting
in front of my children.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.401
I'm handling it.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.362
By letting him coast
a few months?

31:45.362 --> 31:47.197
Let's talk privately.
Come on.

31:47.197 --> 31:50.492
No, no.
The kids can handle this.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.828
Brent's just lucky
he's not facing charges.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.498
I had Jack back off,
which is why it's not going
on his permanent record.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.333
Well, maybe you shouldn't have.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.294
Maybe some real,
lasting consequences
are just what he needs.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.380
Since when are you
the morality police,

32:03.380 --> 32:07.384
since Keith got you pregnant
and you didn't marry him twice?

32:07.384 --> 32:09.010
Don't talk to her like that!

32:09.010 --> 32:11.304
Guys, let's...
let's just calm down.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.723
Are you defending him?

32:13.723 --> 32:15.684
-It's not Luke's fault.
-Can you stay out of this?

32:15.684 --> 32:18.061
It has nothing to do with you.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.731
At least I take responsibility
for my actions.

32:21.731 --> 32:25.068
I don't just
sweep things under the rug
to protect my social status.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.740
(whispering) You're gonna
regret that one, Debbo.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.201
Steve:
Well...

32:33.201 --> 32:36.997
I know reputation
is everything to you,

32:36.997 --> 32:39.207
but this is what you get

32:39.207 --> 32:42.085
when you prioritize
"the Chambers name"
over your family.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.213
I hope it was worth it.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.101
-(dance music pounding)
-(girls laughing)

33:08.111 --> 33:10.488
-Floor it!
-What happened?

33:10.488 --> 33:13.533
-Sheriff Myer was in there,
I think he saw us!
-Luke, go!

33:18.955 --> 33:21.625
♪ I don't really care
about what you think... ♪

33:21.625 --> 33:23.877
Were you drinking?

33:23.877 --> 33:26.004
Maybe. Rum and coke.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.631
And tequila.

33:27.631 --> 33:28.840
What? All of them?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.342
You drank? Seriously?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.677
-Yep.
-Like a boss.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.596
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

33:34.596 --> 33:37.098
I would've liked to have
seen that, your first time.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.850
Wait, but maybe we still can.
It's early.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.852
The night doesn't have to end.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.854
Go on, go, Luke! Go!

33:42.854 --> 33:44.814
(water dripping)

33:47.901 --> 33:50.153
Debbie: Maybe we should take
Isabella's offer.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.738
Absolutely not.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.697
Debbie:
As a loan.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.201
We'll pay it back.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.662
I already owe her too much for
helping me keep the scholarship.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.913
(phone rings)

34:03.166 --> 34:05.210
-Hello?
-guy: Go back
to where you came from,

34:05.210 --> 34:06.670
you stanky dirty ho!

34:07.837 --> 34:09.297
(hangs up phone)

34:09.297 --> 34:11.883
Just a stupid prank call.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.718
(phone ringing)

34:15.720 --> 34:17.472
Debbie:
It could be Luke.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.682
Or Steve.

34:18.682 --> 34:19.766
(ringing continues)

34:23.979 --> 34:26.064
-Hello?
-guy: Cheating bitch!

34:29.484 --> 34:30.652
What did they say?

34:30.652 --> 34:34.614
Just... calling Isabella
horrible names.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.950
Oh, that stupid tape,
it's ruining everything.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.955
This cover story's putting a lot
of pressure on both of you,

34:41.955 --> 34:44.207
your friendship.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.667
Are you sure it's worth it?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.254
Better be.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.463
It's my future.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.720
Are you and Steve gonna be okay?

34:56.720 --> 34:58.263
Hmm.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.681
I don't know.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.850
Love isn't always enough.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.477
You also need to see the world
in the same way.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.776
(laughing)

35:11.776 --> 35:13.028
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.614
Okay, to the best
cocktail sensei

35:15.614 --> 35:16.906
a girl could ask for.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.326
Tonight has been
truly unforgettable.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.494
It's only the beginning.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.204
(Luke laughs)

35:23.204 --> 35:24.706
Hey, uh, who are you

35:24.706 --> 35:26.875
and what have you done
with my friend Megan?

35:26.875 --> 35:29.878
I'm still here.
I'm just living in the now.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.963
Jeff:
It looks really good on you.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.799
Wanna go for a walk?

35:34.799 --> 35:36.509
I thought you'd never ask.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.560
Have you ever heard
of a body shot?

35:47.896 --> 35:50.315
(laughs) We'll get you in
next time, Raymond.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.525
Jeff: You might be the only
other person in our grade

35:52.525 --> 35:54.235
who knows
who Raymond Chandler is.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.988
Oh, The Big Sleep is a classic.
It's one of my favorite books.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.657
(laughs)

35:58.657 --> 36:00.700
It's so unfair that we didn't
get to use your ID.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.702
It was perfect.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.080
Honestly...

36:05.080 --> 36:06.790
the whole thing was worth it,

36:06.790 --> 36:08.375
just to spend time with you.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.637
The dance floor,
it wasn't, like, that big,

36:20.637 --> 36:23.014
but it didn't matter because
the drinks were so strong

36:23.014 --> 36:25.975
and Megan was on fire.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.687
Sorry. Yeah?

36:28.687 --> 36:30.271
Wish you would have gotten in.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.774
Me too.
Sounds like a blast.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.443
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, we had fun.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.964
-Jack?
-Debbie.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.507
What's going on?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.676
(clears throat)

36:59.676 --> 37:03.138
I have a warrant.
For Megan's computer.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.681
Why do you want my computer?

37:04.681 --> 37:08.268
We have reason to believe
it contains evidence of fraud.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.436
Fraud?

37:11.604 --> 37:13.523
I... No, wait, no.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.859
You can't just
go through my stuff! Wait!

37:20.238 --> 37:21.740
(engine starts)

37:54.731 --> 37:56.858
Then he kissed me.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.111
How was it?
Did your whole body light up
like a pinball machine?

38:00.111 --> 38:05.033
(laughs) Um, not exactly,
but I can't wait to do it again.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.952
-That's my girl.
-(laughs)

38:07.952 --> 38:10.580
(sighs) So, what happens next?
Do I call him?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.874
-Do I wait for him to call me?
-Hmm-mm, no.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.502
Just try to enjoy the moment.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.921
Look, I mean,
you snuck into a bar,

38:17.921 --> 38:20.548
drank like a pro,
and then kissed a cute guy.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.550
Doesn't get much better
than that.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.303
(sighs) True.
It feels pretty amazing.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.639
I don't want the night to end.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.848
You should sleep over.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.186
I'd love to.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.522
As long as you don't snore
when you drink.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.148
(laughing)

38:37.148 --> 38:39.234
Oh, Megan! Boom!

38:44.405 --> 38:46.658
The Sheriff took my computer
this morning.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.201
Yeah, he had a warrant.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.744
There's stuff on it.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.163
It'll be really bad
if they find it.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.832
I did. Twice.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.543
Took every precaution
I could think of, I just...

38:56.543 --> 38:58.169
I don't know if I got
the code right.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.466
(chatter over police radio)

39:05.385 --> 39:07.095
Hey, try that one.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.638
Maybe it'll give us
some insight

39:08.638 --> 39:10.390
into what she was up to
the day before Luke's murder.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.312
Crap! There's some
kind of virus on here.

39:21.317 --> 39:22.402
Damn.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.040
Hey. I guess you convinced
the plumber?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.834
Never called him.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.544
Steve sent them.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.504
His way of trying to apologize.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.271
Anything good?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.194
Uh, no, no, just junk mail.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.501
I've just received
some information

40:20.501 --> 40:23.212
that sheds a whole
new light on things.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.340
You've been playing it
fast and loose with the truth

40:25.340 --> 40:26.716
ever since Luke disappeared,

40:26.716 --> 40:29.010
but let me paint
a picture for you.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.055
On January 1st, Luke
disappeared without a trace,

40:32.055 --> 40:35.558
and you were the last person
to see him alive.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.518
He ran away.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.228
That's your version of events.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.772
His letter backs it up.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.398
The letter with
your fingerprints on it?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.150
Because I was helping him.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.152
Were you?

40:46.152 --> 40:49.072
Or was it just part
of a cover-up?

40:49.072 --> 40:52.241
Do you have a point?
'Cause so far this just
sounds like a fairytale.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.035
Luke was the love of your life.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.621
But by all accounts,

40:56.621 --> 40:59.832
your relationship was never
the same after the sex tape.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.710
Too many secrets,
too many lies.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.590
And it only got worse when you
found out you were pregnant.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.760
Sheriff, I need to--

41:10.760 --> 41:12.679
I believe you and Luke
went to the cabin.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.180
You told him you were pregnant

41:14.180 --> 41:17.558
and he rejected the idea
of a baby with you,

41:17.558 --> 41:20.019
a future with you.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.899
So you killed him.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.912
