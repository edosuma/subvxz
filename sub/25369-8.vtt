00:01.376 --> 00:04.046
<i>[Peter] Three days before</i>
<i>the Horizon High Open House,</i>

00:04.046 --> 00:06.924
<i>and, thanks to my secret life</i>
<i>as Spider‐Man,</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:09.009
<i>barely started</i>
<i>to get my project together.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.802
<i>I'm trying to build</i>

00:10.802 --> 00:12.971
<i>an environmentally sound</i>
<i>energy amplifier,</i>

00:12.971 --> 00:14.973
<i>and companies have been</i>
<i>known to buy inventions</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:17.017
<i>directly from the Open House,</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.436
<i>which is something my bank</i>
<i>account could really use,</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:23.273
<i>because without a job,</i>
<i>I can't afford school.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:25.150
<i>But you know</i>
<i>what else I can't afford?</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.736
$162.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.239
<i>Equipment for my project.</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:33.575
Sorry. Too expensive.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.080
Used equipment‐‐ $97.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.122
Uhh.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.334
Very used equipment‐‐

00:42.334 --> 00:44.127
42 bucks.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.212
[sighs]

00:54.096 --> 00:56.265
New York City, Panda‐Mania.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.642
Can you believe it?
The Big Apple.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.228
And we're
three hours early.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.063
I told you there wouldn't
be any traffic, Hippo,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.358
but no, you had
to get us on the road
at 2:00 in the morning.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.068
So how about some sightseeing?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.695
Wax museum? Or‐Or‐Or‐‐

01:09.695 --> 01:11.405
I've always wanted to take
one of those tour boats

01:11.405 --> 01:13.198
around the island.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.242
You get seasick
in the bathtub.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.620
Of course, there's always
our favorite pastime.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.959
<i>[Jameson] I was captured</i>
<i>by that lunatic Venom!</i>

01:23.959 --> 01:25.586
<i>All Spider‐Man's fault!</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:27.212
[Peter scoffs]
My fault?

01:27.212 --> 01:30.173
<i>Since that wall‐crawling</i>
<i>weasel first appeared,</i>

01:30.173 --> 01:33.135
<i>New York's been overrun</i>
<i>by his superpowered cronies.</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:35.804
<i>Do your job,</i>
<i>Police Chief Watanabe.</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:37.556
<i>Bring that masked menace</i>
<i>to justice,</i>

01:37.556 --> 01:39.474
<i>or face the consequences!</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:41.852
Uh‐‐

01:41.852 --> 01:43.061
[disguised voice]
Spider‐Man's

01:43.061 --> 01:44.187
not all that bad.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.148
[woman] Uh‐huh.
[explosion]

01:46.148 --> 01:47.149
Uh‐oh.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.944
Aw, yeah!

01:50.944 --> 01:52.112
I love bank robbing.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.239
A panda person.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.116
That's got to be the weirdest
thing I'll see all day.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.285
[grunting]

01:58.285 --> 02:00.078
So awkward.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.705
I take that back.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.167
One web locker
for my equipment.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.710
Now time to become
a zookeeper.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.295
[both panting]

02:11.006 --> 02:12.174
Who the heck are you?
[gasps]

02:12.174 --> 02:13.884
You're kidding.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.386
Spider‐Man?
The web‐swinging wonder?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263
Idol of millions?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.098
[audible shrug]

02:20.098 --> 02:22.559
Sorry. We're from Toledo.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561
Then welcome to New York.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.772
Ooh! I told you
we would have had
more fun

02:26.772 --> 02:27.939
at the wax museum.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.816
[grunts]
Are you kidding?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.654
This is where the fun
really starts.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.199
Uhh. I hate tourists!

02:48.585 --> 02:49.628
[grunts]

02:49.628 --> 02:51.004
You come to New York,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.173
rob a bank,
and trash our statues?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.800
Who came up with your
vacation itinerary?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.760
[gasps]
Uhh!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.762
Ow! Ohh!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.599
You'll save yourself a lot
of unnecessary bruising

03:02.599 --> 03:03.934
if you just give up now.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.103
No way. You ain't
taking this job

03:06.103 --> 03:07.938
and stealing our cash.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.065
Raah! Ha! Ha!

03:10.065 --> 03:11.525
First of all,
it's not your cash.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.443
Ohh!
And second of all,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.362
I'm not stealing it,
I'm giving it back.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.322
You're
supposed to be a good guy?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.574
In a scary spider costume?

03:19.574 --> 03:20.992
As if.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.496
[tellers]
Ohh!

03:25.497 --> 03:26.873
I happen to be

03:26.873 --> 03:28.667
New York's
most beloved superhero,

03:28.667 --> 03:31.294
as anyone in this bank
will tell you.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.255
Just don't hurt us,
Spider‐Man!

03:33.255 --> 03:35.257
Hurt? But‐‐

03:35.257 --> 03:37.634
Jameson! Huh!

03:37.634 --> 03:38.844
[straining]

03:38.844 --> 03:40.679
Body slam!

03:50.105 --> 03:51.148
[Panda‐Mania]
Menace!

03:54.901 --> 03:56.361
[grunting]

03:56.361 --> 03:58.488
So, wax museum?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.698
Seriously?

03:59.698 --> 04:01.283
Just grab the bags,
Fluffy Lumpkins,

04:01.283 --> 04:02.576
and let's move!

04:02.576 --> 04:04.494
What are we gonna do
till the meeting starts?

04:04.494 --> 04:07.372
It's a big city,
with a lot of banks.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.915
[groaning]

04:10.208 --> 04:11.418
Ohh!

04:11.418 --> 04:13.295
Out of the way!

04:13.295 --> 04:14.754
Hey, wait up!
[grunting]

04:14.754 --> 04:15.797
Ohh. Oh, pardon‐‐

04:15.797 --> 04:17.424
Oh, excuse me. Just make way.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.550
Oh, sorry!

04:18.550 --> 04:19.634
Sorry.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.976
We should have taken a cab.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.644
When am I ever gonna
get another crack

04:29.644 --> 04:31.396
at riding a New York
subway?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.024
Hey, where's the rest
of our money?

04:34.024 --> 04:37.235
Sorry. I'm an even‐toed
ungulate.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.112
Among other things.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.531
Oh, well.
There's a bank in SoHo
that looks promising,

04:41.531 --> 04:43.909
but we have to get off
at the next stop
and change trains.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.536
You think that spider guy's
gonna come after us?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.331
After the beat‐down
we gave him,

04:49.331 --> 04:51.333
he'd be a perfect idiot
to tangle with us again.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.502
Whoa!
[gasps]
Whoa.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.086
I don't know about "perfect."

04:55.086 --> 04:56.254
[Panda‐Mania]
How?

04:56.254 --> 04:58.924
My unerring subway sonar
led me right to you.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.134
You have subway sonar?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.344
No.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.471
That map shows every stop.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.932
Doesn't Toledo have a subway?

05:06.932 --> 05:09.309
You're not getting
away from me in my town.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.395
What are you doing?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.147
Running away!

05:14.147 --> 05:15.148
Sorry.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.653
That's obvious, but why?

05:19.653 --> 05:22.572
This spider guy knows the city
like the back of his webs.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.407
Let's forget about robbing
New York banks.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.659
Just get to the meeting and‐‐

05:25.659 --> 05:27.285
I make the decisions
on this team,

05:27.285 --> 05:28.787
and I say‐‐ Huh?

05:28.787 --> 05:29.996
Aah!

05:29.996 --> 05:31.623
One down, one to‐‐

05:31.623 --> 05:32.624
[horn blaring]
Uh‐oh.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.543
Aah!

05:35.919 --> 05:37.921
Are you all right?
Aah! Uhh!

05:37.921 --> 05:39.339
With my tough hide,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.049
it'll take more than that
to stop me.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.469
[horn blares]

05:46.346 --> 05:47.514
Rude much?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.432
Okay, tourists,

05:49.432 --> 05:51.309
get ready
for some spectacular views

05:51.309 --> 05:53.937
of New York's
best prison cells.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.397
Aah!

05:55.397 --> 05:58.400
I can even draw you a map
so you don't get lost.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.570
How are you so fast?
It's not human.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.408
Not human?
You're a hippopotamus.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.160
[horn blaring]

06:10.537 --> 06:12.539
The ceiling's
going to collapse.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.958
Another reason why you
should never take
animals on the subway.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.503
Oh, no.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.463
[honking]

06:20.463 --> 06:23.174
Run!

06:23.174 --> 06:24.926
You have the money?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.094
Uh...

06:26.094 --> 06:28.471
You better hope
tonight pays off.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.569
[screaming]

06:44.446 --> 06:45.989
Ta‐da!

06:49.409 --> 06:50.619
Don't worry. I'm fine.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.953
Everybody get out now,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.997
before he wrecks
the rest of the station!

06:53.997 --> 06:56.541
[crowd screaming]
No, wait. I was saving you.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.960
I‐‐ I was talking to myself.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.378
[growls]

07:01.796 --> 07:03.423
Jameson.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.806
Whoa. There are some
heavy hitters here.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.684
Yeah. This thing's
bigger than we realized.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.647
<i>Quite an impressive response</i>
<i>to my invitations.</i>

07:18.647 --> 07:21.524
<i>Greed is an exceptional</i>
<i>motivator.</i>

07:21.524 --> 07:23.318
<i>And if you want to collect</i>

07:23.318 --> 07:25.445
<i>the generous bounty</i>
<i>I have offered,</i>

07:25.445 --> 07:28.365
<i>then all you have to do is...</i>

07:28.365 --> 07:31.493
<i>bring me Spider‐Man.</i>

07:31.493 --> 07:33.453
Spider‐Man?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.246
Not again. No way.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.248
<i>Who among you‐‐</i>
Pardon me. Excuse me.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.625
<i>...has the courage</i>
<i>and skill‐‐</i>
I'm so sorry.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.710
<i>...to be victorious?</i>
Just let me get by.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.295
Sorry. Pardon me.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.636
So, uh, wax museum?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.429
Fine.
Aw.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.557
Mmm!
No hugging!

07:54.557 --> 07:56.893
Sorry. I was just
overwhelmed with emotion

07:56.893 --> 07:58.937
over famous people
in wax.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
You are so weird.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.152
Okay, fighting a hippo
and a panda

08:06.152 --> 08:07.987
wasn't exactly
the evening I had planned,

08:07.987 --> 08:11.616
and neither was saying
something that crazy.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.577
But the Horizon Open House is
now two and a half days away,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.996
so I have to kick things
into gear, starting‐‐

08:21.209 --> 08:22.711
[sighs]

08:22.711 --> 08:24.838
Not any time soon.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.257
[groans]

08:27.257 --> 08:29.968
Aunt May, do we have any glue?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.469
A lot of glue?

08:34.848 --> 08:37.392
<i>[Aunt May]</i>
<i>You missed a wonderful</i>
<i>brunch, Peter.</i>

08:37.392 --> 08:39.602
The wheat cakes
were fantastic,

08:39.602 --> 08:41.688
though not as good
as mine, obvs.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.399
[scoffs]
Did you just say "obvs"?

08:44.399 --> 08:46.317
<i>Oh, is that</i>
<i>not cool anymore?</i>

08:46.317 --> 08:48.069
Maybe you'll bring it back.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.488
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't
make brunch, Aunt May,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.699
but I have to
finish this project,
and I've only got‐‐

08:52.699 --> 08:54.451
<i>Got two days.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

08:54.451 --> 08:56.453
You'll get it done.
You always do.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.830
And it will be exceptional.
I'm sure of it.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.415
Yaah!

09:03.501 --> 09:05.503
I wish I had
your confidence in me.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.465
I've always
had confidence in you,

09:08.465 --> 09:09.632
and so did your Uncle Ben.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.468
He‐‐ Aah!

09:12.594 --> 09:13.928
[sirens blaring]

09:13.928 --> 09:15.555
<i>Aunt May?</i>

09:15.555 --> 09:16.765
Aunt May?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.266
That was some kind of‐‐

09:18.266 --> 09:20.101
What do they call them?
Monster trucks?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.896
Only it's a bus.
Must be going
80 miles an hour,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.439
right through
all the lights.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.565
<i>Someone's got to stop it,</i>

09:25.565 --> 09:26.983
<i>or people</i>
<i>are gonna get hurt.</i>

09:26.983 --> 09:28.109
[sighs]

09:28.109 --> 09:30.236
And I know
who that "someone" is.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.785
Excuse me!
Got to catch a bus!
Wha‐‐

09:38.703 --> 09:41.456
You know your problem, people?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.166
You're all too slow!

09:43.166 --> 09:44.667
Ha ha ha ha!

09:44.667 --> 09:45.919
I don't believe we've met.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.339
Spider‐Man. Finally.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.382
Joyride's over, dude.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.181
Name's Overdrive.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.599
Remember it.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.480
What is this,
Weird New Villains Weekend?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.816
Well, so much for hoping
this bus was empty.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.026
So let me guess.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.778
Nanites?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.946
Like little nano‐machines,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.572
rebuilding the tech
on this bus

10:14.572 --> 10:16.241
on a microscopic level?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.493
Didn't know
you were the science type.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.746
Huh. Well, "Science‐Man"
isn't as catchy of a name.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.415
But you have to communicate
with the nanites somehow.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.834
Let me guess. You text them?

10:25.834 --> 10:29.629
I believe in physical
communication.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.549
Okay, see, that's exactly
why we use science terms.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.592
Otherwise, it just sounds
super‐‐ Aah!

10:35.927 --> 10:37.595
What is your deal?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.639
It's all about
the need for speed.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.266
And you just can't keep up,
can you?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.267
[gasping]

10:42.267 --> 10:45.562
Didn't think so, insect.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.776
Wow, that bus is fast.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.820
When I take the bus,
it's really slow!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.531
So many violations.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.533
Going 200 in a 25.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.534
Reckless endangerment!

10:59.534 --> 11:00.535
Aah!

11:00.535 --> 11:02.829
That costume, Speedy Pants.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.415
Whoa! You don't like
the name "Speedy Pants."

11:05.415 --> 11:06.791
Noted!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.668
Speed is my thing.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.753
Risk, danger.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.505
Getting the adrenaline
pumping.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.883
You did this because
you like to go fast?

11:14.883 --> 11:18.469
No. Speed's
just a bonus for me.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.763
I did this to get to you,
web‐head.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.310
[bus approaching]
Huh?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.691
Free us!

11:33.151 --> 11:35.570
This is worse than what you did
in the subway,

11:35.570 --> 11:36.738
menace.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.947
What, me?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.158
No, that was Hippo. He and‐‐

11:40.158 --> 11:43.161
I heard what that
J. Jonah Jameson guy said.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.788
You're all in it together.
Cronies!

11:45.788 --> 11:47.457
"Cronies"?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.708
Jameson!

11:51.586 --> 11:54.088
"Physical communication,"
he said.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.798
Overdrive
has to be in contact

11:55.798 --> 11:57.508
with whatever he transforms,

11:57.508 --> 12:00.511
or it eventually reverts
back to normal.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.680
Okay, everyone, stay calm,
and I'll keep you‐‐
[engine accelerates]

12:02.680 --> 12:04.224
Huh?
...safe.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.308
Yikes!

12:05.308 --> 12:06.726
Overdrive's attack‐‐
Huh?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.811
...must have jammed the bus
into high gear.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.688
Whoa! Oh!

12:10.688 --> 12:11.856
Ohh!

12:15.485 --> 12:16.903
Whoa!
Whoa!

12:17.862 --> 12:20.156
Okay, this pedal
should stop the bus.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.282
Or not!

12:21.282 --> 12:22.367
[grunts]

12:22.367 --> 12:24.118
Scatter!
Huh?

12:24.118 --> 12:27.247
[Spider‐Man]
I don't have
my driver's license yet!

12:45.682 --> 12:47.100
You deliberately tried

12:47.100 --> 12:49.519
to crash that bus
into this construction site.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.813
To prove what?
You hate buses?

13:00.571 --> 13:03.616
Wait. Was this all
supposed to be a big trap?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.870
Worked pretty well,
didn't it?

13:07.870 --> 13:11.582
I've got places to be
and races to run.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.043
So long, Spider‐Man.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.801
If that's the best
you've got...

13:24.846 --> 13:26.973
you're gonna have to go
back to Bad Guy School

13:26.973 --> 13:29.017
and take Basic Trapping 101.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.732
Whoop. Oh!

13:35.732 --> 13:37.817
Aah!

13:42.030 --> 13:42.822
School?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.700
Ha! I'm self‐taught.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.952
And that's not the trap.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.037
This is.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.258
All those hard cases,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.135
all those big names,

14:04.135 --> 14:05.845
and I'm the one who got him.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.181
Overdrive beat Spider‐Man,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.683
and now it's time to collect.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.817
Digging him up's
gonna take all day.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.235
I don't have the patience
for this.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.238
This ought to be enough
to convince them

14:24.238 --> 14:26.032
Spidey's been taken down.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.536
Ah.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.081
Ah, web cocoon.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.207
Best idea I've ever had

14:34.207 --> 14:36.918
while having a building
fall on top of me.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.628
[grunting]
Problem is,

14:38.628 --> 14:40.755
a web cocoon
can keep me alive

14:40.755 --> 14:43.758
but can't get me out of here
to stay alive.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.635
[grunting]

14:47.845 --> 14:50.890
This Overdrive guy wasn't
just committing a crime,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.225
he was hunting me.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.393
Everyone on that bus
was in danger

14:54.393 --> 14:56.312
just because I exist.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.023
No wonder people think
I'm a menace.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.109
But if I'm gonna show
this city I'm not...

15:02.568 --> 15:04.987
I've got to bring
Overdrive down.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.120
But how?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.958
Aha! A sample
of Overdrive's nanites.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.755
Now we're in business.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.924
I just need to figure out
how they work.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.972
The nanotech's programmed

15:30.972 --> 15:33.141
to respond
to Overdrive's thoughts.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.102
Wonder if I can manipulate
the nanites' processing code

15:36.102 --> 15:37.687
so they'll respond to mine.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.940
Experiment‐‐ would
a nano‐souped‐up vacuum

15:40.940 --> 15:43.067
clean the house
in, like, 2.2 seconds?

15:45.611 --> 15:49.157
Well, so much for nanites
handling my chores.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.616
Maybe they can't
be programmed

15:50.616 --> 15:52.201
for my DNA code.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.538
Uh‐oh. The bus?
The need for speed?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.123
Did Overdrive
design his nanites

15:57.123 --> 15:58.833
to only work on vehicles?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.462
Okay, I need
a kick‐butt vehicle

16:03.462 --> 16:04.881
to test this theory.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.969
Hmm. Maybe if I was chasing
a preschool supervillain.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.848
Wait a minute. Uncle Ben's...

16:20.771 --> 16:23.232
Don't wobble, Petey.
Keep her steady.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.027
Steady.
[fretting]

16:26.027 --> 16:27.653
That's my boy.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.077
So when do I
get to ride this one?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.704
Not yet, buddy.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.748
Not till you've grown
into the amazing young man

16:38.748 --> 16:40.249
I know you're gonna be
one day.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.879
But you can have a minute
to get the feel of her.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.506
Easy, Peter.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.634
The shifter's a real beast.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.937
Hmm. Looks like
my theory was right.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.855
Now to implement my own ideas.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.163
The Spider Shifter.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.791
Thanks, Uncle Ben.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.087
Whoo‐hoo!

17:39.350 --> 17:41.561
I've covered half the city
looking for you,

17:41.561 --> 17:44.230
and here you are, returning
to the scene of the crime.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.232
You're still alive?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.150
Wait. Is that my tech?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.694
You stole my tech?

17:49.694 --> 17:51.612
You left your nanites
just laying around.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.406
Couldn't resist.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.200
Don't worry. I made
some improvements.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.618
Bet you can't keep up.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.246
Oh, pul‐ease.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.123
Nobody's
faster than Overdrive.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.458
DeFalco Parkway's
not scheduled to open

18:04.458 --> 18:06.085
for another two weeks.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.837
Want to test
that hypothesis?

18:16.971 --> 18:19.765
So why were you going back
to the construction site?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.475
Having second thoughts
about what you did?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.060
They wouldn't take
your glove as proof,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.520
so I needed your body.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.230
"They"? Who's "they"?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.733
They're the ones that are
gonna make me rich

18:28.733 --> 18:31.152
when I take you down.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.534
Oh, hey.
Can your bike do that?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.119
Didn't think so.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.371
That ride of yours
may have some tricks,

18:42.371 --> 18:44.498
but mine are better.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.814
You really thought
that would work?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.608
You invented this stuff.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.234
Now you're starting
to annoy me.

19:12.234 --> 19:16.238
Starting? I've been doing
my best to annoy you all day.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.740
Uh‐oh.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.220
I thought you said
your bike was fast.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.221
You weren't lying, were you?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.223
Nobody's faster than me!

19:42.223 --> 19:43.224
Nobody!

19:55.569 --> 19:57.988
Huh? What's happening?

19:57.988 --> 20:00.324
Oh, I overwrote your code.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.743
Inputted a virus
into your chopper back there.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.495
Science‐Man, remember?

20:04.495 --> 20:06.997
Push that thing beyond
150 miles per hour,

20:06.997 --> 20:10.042
and the nanotech
overheats and shuts down.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.387
It's over, Overdrive.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.055
Were you
rehearsing that?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.432
[sirens blaring]
[scoffs] No.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.104
He's all yours, officers.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.939
You're both in trouble.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.524
What'd I do?

20:33.524 --> 20:36.152
Allegedly robbed a bank,

20:36.152 --> 20:37.486
wrecked a subway station,

20:37.486 --> 20:39.739
terrified a busload
of innocent people,

20:39.739 --> 20:40.823
and now...

20:42.158 --> 20:43.200
speeding.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.911
You're kidding!

20:45.911 --> 20:47.455
A speeding ticket?

20:47.455 --> 20:49.206
Yeah. You get
used to them.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.593
Peter, you did all this?

21:00.593 --> 21:03.053
Uh, I was reminded today

21:03.053 --> 21:04.472
that when I hit a roadblock,

21:04.472 --> 21:07.224
you and Uncle Ben
always gave me the skills

21:07.224 --> 21:08.434
to break through.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.896
Obvs.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.440
Well, then, let's
sit down and‐‐

21:14.440 --> 21:18.360
I can't. Got to get back
to my project for Horizon.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.820
But you need to eat.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.448
You know, I'm on
a really tight deadline.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.492
But...

21:25.493 --> 21:26.869
I can always slow down

21:26.869 --> 21:28.537
for what's really important.
