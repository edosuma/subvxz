M_I_SForEver

00:42.526 --> 00:44.562
<i>That's me, Bob Zellner,</i>

00:45.429 --> 00:46.564
<i>the one in between.</i>

00:46.598 --> 00:49.366
<i>You've got to keep the white
and the Black separate.</i>

00:49.399 --> 00:52.536
<i>The South was in an uproar
over the Civil Rights Movement</i>

00:52.570 --> 00:55.305
<i>In my town,
Montgomery, Alabama,</i>

00:55.339 --> 00:57.575
<i>five years ago,
there was a bus boycott</i>

00:57.609 --> 01:00.177
<i>which began with the arrest
of Mrs. Rosa Parks</i>

01:00.210 --> 01:02.245
<i>for not giving up her seat
to a white man.</i>

01:02.279 --> 01:03.881
<i>We walk with God.</i>

01:03.915 --> 01:06.350
<i>If we have to walk for a year,</i>

01:06.383 --> 01:09.453
<i>we'll walk until those buses
are no longer segregated.</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:10.722
<i>That's what happened.</i>

01:10.755 --> 01:13.223
<i>They walked for a year
and they won.</i>

01:13.256 --> 01:15.525
<i>Some of my people got
pretty ticked off about that.</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:19.396
<i>Have no fear. The Right and
the white will win.</i>

01:19.429 --> 01:21.264
<i>And last year
was the sit-ins</i>

01:21.298 --> 01:22.800
<i>to desegregate lunch counters</i>

01:22.834 --> 01:24.102
<i>all across the South.</i>

01:25.402 --> 01:26.871
<i>As you can see,</i>

01:26.904 --> 01:28.906
<i>a lot of white folks
had a short fuse</i>

01:28.940 --> 01:30.708
<i>when it came to
the Civil Rights Movement.</i>

01:30.742 --> 01:31.809
Here he is.

01:31.843 --> 01:34.378
<i>This group,
the spark that lit their fuse</i>

01:34.411 --> 01:36.179
<i>was a college paper
I got assigned to do</i>

01:36.213 --> 01:37.314
<i>with four of my friends,</i>

01:38.750 --> 01:41.886
<i>a paper on race relations.</i>

01:43.420 --> 01:44.789
<i>That's what could
get you killed.</i>

01:46.490 --> 01:47.625
<i>A senior paper.</i>

04:47.572 --> 04:50.675
<i>Five months ago,
life was simpler.</i>

04:50.708 --> 04:52.710
Come on, baby. Let's twist.

04:53.811 --> 04:56.479
Wait a minute. Are you even
old enough to drink?

04:56.513 --> 04:57.949
What is this
you got growing right here?

04:57.982 --> 04:59.650
Got dirt on your face?
What is it?

04:59.684 --> 05:02.053
You know, boys, I happen to
think that it looks pretty good.

05:02.086 --> 05:04.021
You know, I got a cat
back in Mississippi.

05:04.055 --> 05:05.022
I could lick that off for you.

05:05.056 --> 05:07.725
Whoa, whoa, look out,
ladies and gentlemen,

05:07.758 --> 05:09.861
we've got a genuine
bona fide scholar.

05:09.894 --> 05:13.430
How does a dumb country boy like
you end up at top of the class?

05:13.463 --> 05:14.999
Hey, school has her favorites.

05:15.032 --> 05:16.734
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.970
To Bob.

05:19.003 --> 05:21.538
Free, white, 21.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.007
I'm not 21 anymore.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.609
Come on, Bob. Let's dance.

05:24.642 --> 05:25.643
- Carol Ann.
- Come on.

05:27.144 --> 05:28.746
Not exactly free, neither.

05:29.379 --> 05:32.650
Boys, look, at his dancing.

05:32.683 --> 05:34.051
He's definitely white.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.868
Okay.

05:50.902 --> 05:52.737
Okay, that's far enough.

05:53.838 --> 05:55.840
- What?
- We have to stop.

05:57.808 --> 05:59.911
Okay. You're right.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.646
You promised.

06:01.679 --> 06:03.080
It won't be long
till we're married.

06:03.114 --> 06:05.149
We just have to be strong.

06:08.085 --> 06:09.587
How do you think she did it?

06:10.154 --> 06:12.857
- Who?
- Joan of Arc.

06:13.658 --> 06:15.458
She wasn't normal.

06:15.492 --> 06:17.094
She didn't think about sex.

06:17.128 --> 06:20.197
No, not, not that. She was
up against everybody

06:20.231 --> 06:21.732
and they burned her
at the stake.

06:21.766 --> 06:24.201
She was a little crazy.
She heard voices.

06:24.235 --> 06:26.570
They told her what to do.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.841
What do your voices
tell you, Bob?

06:30.875 --> 06:34.477
Do they say, "Get your skinny little
white butt to that Black church?

06:34.511 --> 06:37.882
Or do they say,
"Get back in line there, boy?

06:37.915 --> 06:39.817
"The hell do you think
you're doing?"

06:39.850 --> 06:42.186
I already told you.
There's no way.

06:42.219 --> 06:44.655
But all we wanna do is audit
one of their meetings.

06:44.689 --> 06:47.625
Bob, you can't go to
one of their meetings.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.894
The Montgomery Improvement
Association is one of

06:49.927 --> 06:51.662
the most active
civic groups here.

06:51.696 --> 06:54.065
And Miss Rosa Parks is in town
for one of their celebrations.

06:54.098 --> 06:55.132
I forbid this.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.069
You cannot meet with Rosa Parks
or any of them.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.203
<i>Really?</i>

06:59.236 --> 07:02.505
<i>No Black people for
a paper on race relations?</i>

07:02.539 --> 07:04.507
<i>I just didn't see
how we could eliminate</i>

07:04.541 --> 07:06.777
<i>one of the races
the relations were about.</i>

07:06.811 --> 07:08.679
Excuse me, Dr. Abernathy.

07:09.546 --> 07:11.115
My name is Bob Zellner.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.683
This is Townsend Ellis,

07:12.717 --> 07:15.653
John Hill, Joe Thomas
and William Head.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.288
And we are college seniors
working on

07:17.321 --> 07:19.190
our thesis on race relations.

07:19.223 --> 07:21.092
Do you all know Mrs. Parks?

07:21.125 --> 07:22.793
Of course. Yes.

07:22.827 --> 07:25.062
You all attend
the Methodist College?

07:25.096 --> 07:26.564
Yes, ma'am.

07:26.597 --> 07:27.999
They sent you over
to talk to us?

07:28.032 --> 07:30.001
Not exactly.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.269
Not exactly. I see.

07:32.303 --> 07:34.605
We were wondering if we could
ask you a few questions

07:34.638 --> 07:36.539
about the Montgomery
Improvement Association.

07:36.574 --> 07:39.877
Yeah. Well, that is
a laudable endeavor.

07:39.910 --> 07:42.013
We can only hope
that more students

07:42.046 --> 07:44.547
would be willing to tackle
such an important subject.

07:44.582 --> 07:46.984
We were actually wondering if,
with your permission, of course,

07:47.018 --> 07:49.220
we could come to
the celebration at your church.

07:49.253 --> 07:53.124
You do understand the police
might want to arrest you.

07:53.157 --> 07:54.859
Are you all willing to
make that choice?

07:54.892 --> 07:56.694
It ain't anything like that.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.062
We're not trying to
stir up trouble.

07:58.095 --> 07:59.730
Now, now, son.

07:59.764 --> 08:01.799
I'm starting to wonder
if you are aware

08:01.832 --> 08:04.769
of the poison in the apple
that you have bitten into.

08:04.802 --> 08:07.238
You met with him. Talked to him.

08:07.271 --> 08:08.305
Now you got what you want.

08:08.339 --> 08:10.107
Get the paper done.
Hand it in.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.012
You know I'm German.

08:15.046 --> 08:18.049
I've seen the Brownshirts
and the Hitler Youth.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.651
I've seen what people
are capable of.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.788
You've got to
protect yourself.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.859
I'm glad to see today
that we are once again,

08:28.893 --> 08:30.728
blessed with the company of

08:30.761 --> 08:33.097
State Investigator
Willy B. Painter

08:33.130 --> 08:34.565
and Officer Fuller.

08:34.597 --> 08:39.270
Today we have come together in the
Brick-a-Day First Baptist Church.

08:39.303 --> 08:42.106
And I don't think
the assembled would mind

08:42.139 --> 08:45.176
if I lend a welcoming hand

08:45.209 --> 08:49.980
and thank you for so lovingly
recording our messages

08:50.014 --> 08:51.315
for Governor Patterson.

08:51.348 --> 08:54.051
- Amen. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

08:54.085 --> 08:58.689
And as long as the governor
is now listening,

08:58.722 --> 09:03.694
I'd like to ask the governor
if he is aware

09:03.727 --> 09:08.199
of the great economic strides
made here in Montgomery

09:08.232 --> 09:11.735
since the success of the boycott
five years ago.

09:14.672 --> 09:19.910
It appears that freedom is not
only good for the Negro

09:19.944 --> 09:21.846
- in Montgomery...
- That's right.

09:21.879 --> 09:25.249
...but the white population
benefits from it as well.

09:25.282 --> 09:27.885
And I'd like to
tell the governor

09:27.918 --> 09:30.621
that we are glad to help.

09:31.922 --> 09:33.824
But please don't be alarmed.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.326
Yes, sir.

09:35.359 --> 09:39.130
The bus boycott was
only the beginning.

09:39.163 --> 09:44.702
We intend to benefit Montgomery
much more from now on.

09:54.979 --> 09:58.749
It appears the police have
surrounded the church.

09:58.782 --> 09:59.984
What do they want?

10:00.017 --> 10:02.353
They've come to arrest you
and your friends.

10:02.386 --> 10:03.287
For what?

10:03.320 --> 10:06.023
If I recollect,
we had this conversation.

10:06.056 --> 10:07.291
They can't arrest us.

10:07.324 --> 10:10.961
The Montgomery Police Department
might not do many things well,

10:10.995 --> 10:14.732
but arresting white boys for
attending Black churches,

10:14.765 --> 10:16.300
they do extremely well.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.135
We're just doing
research for a paper.

10:18.169 --> 10:20.304
Yeah. I mean, we haven't
chosen any sides here.

10:20.337 --> 10:23.874
I'm not so sure
the powers that be

10:23.908 --> 10:25.276
will so readily agree.

10:25.309 --> 10:28.078
Please. We gotta get out of this
some way.

10:31.782 --> 10:33.284
There's a back door
to the church.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.685
I'll go out front

10:34.718 --> 10:36.787
and draw everybody's attention
around there.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.927
Y'all, come on. John. Eugene.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.428
Y'all get up here
a little closer.

10:44.461 --> 10:46.197
As you all are aware...

10:51.202 --> 10:54.171
Today we have come together
to honor

10:54.205 --> 10:57.841
what became known as
the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

10:59.043 --> 11:00.044
Come on.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.413
Thank you.

11:03.214 --> 11:04.515
Thank you.

11:04.548 --> 11:08.252
You know, there's gonna
come a time when...

11:08.285 --> 11:11.255
something really bad happens
right in front of you,

11:11.288 --> 11:14.425
and you're gonna have to decide
which side you're on.

11:14.458 --> 11:18.262
Not choosing is a choice.

11:29.039 --> 11:32.543
Good. Good, Doc.

11:32.577 --> 11:34.378
Keep that guard up.
Good job, buddy.

11:34.411 --> 11:35.913
- Yeah.
- Good job.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.915
- Good work, Doc. Well done.
- Thank you. Thanks.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.484
Hey, Bob, get in here.

11:42.052 --> 11:43.087
Don't worry about it.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.755
You're not gonna need that.
Come on.

11:49.526 --> 11:51.929
I hear the school's gonna
get you for leading some kind of

11:51.962 --> 11:53.264
Martin Luther Coon rally.

11:54.431 --> 11:55.567
What are you talking about,
Coach?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.969
It's Reverend.
I ain't your coach.

12:00.104 --> 12:03.841
Now, what Bob and I here
are gonna demonstrate for you

12:03.874 --> 12:06.076
is the importance of
keeping your guard up.

12:07.244 --> 12:08.946
- Oh!
- You see?

12:09.513 --> 12:11.181
He let his guard down.

12:11.215 --> 12:12.549
Put your hands up, boy.

12:14.852 --> 12:17.187
What's that about?
You can't take it?

12:17.221 --> 12:18.989
What, you don't know
how to hit back?

12:19.023 --> 12:20.224
I can hit back.

12:26.297 --> 12:27.331
Hey!

12:27.364 --> 12:29.601
The niggers are making you soft.

12:29.634 --> 12:31.368
You can't at least
try to fight back?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.237
I'll try anything three times.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.576
Hey!

12:38.610 --> 12:40.077
How's that, Reverend?

12:40.110 --> 12:41.512
- Is that soft enough for you?
- Hey, hey!

12:41.545 --> 12:43.213
Back off.

12:43.247 --> 12:45.316
Jesus! What the hell you doing?
He's an old man.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.884
You could kill him.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.086
Okay. Come on. Come on.

12:57.494 --> 12:59.631
As the duly elected
Attorney General

12:59.664 --> 13:01.332
of the great State of Alabama,

13:01.365 --> 13:02.734
I look at you and I ask myself

13:02.767 --> 13:08.339
what makes five young, upstanding
Southern scholars like yourselves

13:08.372 --> 13:12.009
go march and sit in

13:12.042 --> 13:16.213
and demonstrate
and generally disrupt the peace?

13:17.414 --> 13:19.116
Excuse me, son.
You have to speak up.

13:19.149 --> 13:21.185
We never did any of that.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.621
March, sit in, demonstrate.

13:23.655 --> 13:26.658
You have fallen under
the influence of the communists.

13:26.691 --> 13:28.392
There's communists in Alabama?

13:28.425 --> 13:31.596
Well, no.

13:31.629 --> 13:33.330
But they come through here.

13:33.364 --> 13:36.033
I'm gonna read you a list of
names and I want you to tell me

13:36.066 --> 13:38.435
which ones you've met with.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.304
Virginia and Clifford Durr,

13:41.673 --> 13:43.540
Anne and Carl Braden,

13:45.142 --> 13:47.144
Aubrey Williams.

13:47.177 --> 13:48.445
Do you know these individuals?

13:48.479 --> 13:50.948
- No.
- No, sir, I don't.

13:50.981 --> 13:52.349
None of them are in Alabama?

13:52.383 --> 13:53.618
Well, the Durrs are here.

13:53.651 --> 13:58.355
Now you boys
are being expelled.

13:58.389 --> 14:00.924
- What?
- Asked to leave.

14:00.958 --> 14:04.495
All right. Asked to leave.

14:05.764 --> 14:09.299
For the sake of the college,
we have negotiated a resolution.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.536
You will not be charged
with any crimes

14:12.570 --> 14:15.139
if you resign from school

14:15.172 --> 14:17.541
and leave the city of Montgomery
immediately.

14:17.575 --> 14:20.144
School has agreed to this.
I think it's more than fair.

14:20.177 --> 14:22.680
I have no idea
what crimes we've committed.

14:22.714 --> 14:25.282
So I see no crime for which
we could be charged.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.418
There are two members
of this group who have achieved

14:27.451 --> 14:29.621
<i>the highest scholastic honors
given by this institution.</i>

14:29.654 --> 14:34.091
Now, this close to graduation,
I will not voluntarily leave.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.994
I think you're making
a mistake there, son.

14:37.027 --> 14:38.563
Look at there.

14:38.596 --> 14:41.198
This is what this was all about,
wasn't it?

14:41.231 --> 14:43.434
You're a big man now.
You're on the front page.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.968
You think I put us in the paper?

14:45.002 --> 14:46.470
You don't care who you ruined.

14:46.503 --> 14:49.473
Townsend, I never called
the paper. I swear.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.341
I just can't imagine why

14:51.375 --> 14:52.677
everybody's drawers
are in an uproar.

14:52.710 --> 14:55.145
We're in Alabama.

14:55.179 --> 14:57.548
But don't you think
this is its own shade of crazy?

14:57.582 --> 14:59.082
I mean, what the hell do we do?

14:59.116 --> 15:00.718
You did what you did

15:00.752 --> 15:02.252
and drug me and John
in it with you.

15:02.286 --> 15:04.622
And what did I do, Townsend?
Exactly what did I do?

15:04.656 --> 15:07.024
You know, for a big boy,
you sure are shit scared

15:07.057 --> 15:08.125
of your own shadow sometimes.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.195
Hey, Zellner. Ku Klux Klan's
about to march on campus

15:11.228 --> 15:12.429
because of what you did.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.531
Professor Kleiner's got a whole
bunch of boys down yonder.

15:14.566 --> 15:16.734
Come on, man, we gotta go.
Shit's about to hit the fan.

15:29.313 --> 15:32.049
Those rowdies
have been telling us

15:32.082 --> 15:35.419
to send
the "nigger lovers" over.

15:35.452 --> 15:38.288
That's outta line, Bob,
calling you a "nigger lover."

15:38.322 --> 15:39.223
That's all that happened?

15:39.256 --> 15:42.326
No, no, no. They tried to
come on campus.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.628
They wanted to get
all five of us.

15:43.661 --> 15:46.263
They called you sons of
you know what.

15:46.296 --> 15:48.666
We told them you're definitely
sons of you-know-what,

15:48.700 --> 15:50.434
but you're our sons of
you-know-what.

15:50.467 --> 15:53.170
And no one's coming on campus
to do anything to anybody.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.740
This ain't right. I'm gonna go
straighten these boys out.

15:56.841 --> 15:58.041
Bobby!

15:59.543 --> 16:01.278
Grandaddy?

16:01.311 --> 16:02.513
Bobby, you're looking thin.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.314
Grandaddy, what are you doing
out here?

16:04.348 --> 16:05.215
They figured out who was who

16:05.249 --> 16:08.318
and they called me down
from Birmingham.

16:08.352 --> 16:11.556
They tell me you went to some,
uh, nigger convention

16:11.589 --> 16:14.324
- or demonstration or something.
- Wasn't anything like that.

16:14.358 --> 16:17.595
We're just doing a paper
for our professor over there.

16:17.629 --> 16:20.163
So this is all about
school work?

16:20.197 --> 16:22.132
- Is that what you're telling me?
- Yeah.

16:24.301 --> 16:26.169
Did you burn that cross
under our dorm room?

16:26.203 --> 16:27.739
Bob, you should know
better than that.

16:29.574 --> 16:30.608
But I'm gonna
tell you something.

16:30.642 --> 16:32.109
Some of these old boys
around here,

16:32.142 --> 16:33.477
they really mean to
do you some harm.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.112
It's good they didn't
catch me alone.

16:35.145 --> 16:37.147
Do you think that professor
saved you?

16:37.180 --> 16:38.616
Have enough of those boys that,

16:38.650 --> 16:41.819
they killed their share of Nazis
back in the big one.

16:41.853 --> 16:43.487
I don't think one more
dead Kraut

16:43.520 --> 16:44.789
would bother them very much.

16:45.857 --> 16:47.424
I stopped them, Bob.

16:47.457 --> 16:50.260
Daddy, Daddy,
just hold it right there.

16:50.294 --> 16:52.462
It's all your fault.
You know that, don't you?

16:52.496 --> 16:55.165
- That's my fault?
- You're goddamn right, it is.

16:55.198 --> 16:58.603
Taught this boy right from wrong
right from the get-go,

16:58.636 --> 17:00.504
he wouldn't have gotten himself
into any trouble.

17:00.537 --> 17:02.506
I wouldn't have to be down here
trying to get him out of it.

17:02.539 --> 17:04.876
So when did it become a capital
offense to go to church?

17:04.909 --> 17:06.209
White or colored?

17:08.377 --> 17:11.281
I'm heading back up to
Birmingham a little while.

17:11.315 --> 17:12.449
All right.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.355
Look around you, Townsend,
we've got support.

17:18.387 --> 17:19.857
Nobody has to leave school.

17:19.891 --> 17:21.491
No,
<i>you</i> got support, Bob.

17:21.525 --> 17:24.294
If the Klan or school touches
a hair on your head,

17:24.328 --> 17:26.195
your daddy will show up
with 20 liberal preachers

17:26.229 --> 17:27.898
to protect
your skinny little ass.

17:27.932 --> 17:29.366
No offense, Mr. Zellner.

17:29.399 --> 17:31.401
I'm here for you too, son.

17:31.435 --> 17:33.437
It's a nice thought, sir,
but it's not altogether true.

17:34.371 --> 17:36.340
The rest of us, we're leaving.

17:36.373 --> 17:39.911
We're going back to Mobile
and Union Springs and Dothan.

17:39.944 --> 17:42.212
What do you think our families
are gonna do when we get there?

17:42.245 --> 17:44.448
Gonna help pick out the limb
the Klan's gonna hang us from.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.618
I know it looks scary from
where you're standing right now.

17:46.651 --> 17:48.218
You got options, Bob.

17:48.251 --> 17:51.355
That's why in your head,
this is just some big game.

17:51.388 --> 17:54.358
You do not have the commitment
of someone like Rosa Parks.

17:54.391 --> 17:57.527
You're going off to some
impressive school in the fall.

17:57.562 --> 17:59.797
- Full scholarship.
- Yeah, and I worked hard for that.

17:59.831 --> 18:00.732
Yeah, so did I. Bob.

18:00.765 --> 18:02.299
Which one do you think
you're gonna pick?

18:03.233 --> 18:06.269
- Yale? Princeton?
- Harvard?

18:08.372 --> 18:10.407
You'll have a hell of a story
to tell 'em when you get there.

18:11.475 --> 18:12.476
Excuse me.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.473
Virginia and Clifford Durr.

18:46.978 --> 18:48.713
This is where they live?

18:49.446 --> 18:50.447
Wow.

19:05.763 --> 19:06.998
Hello.
You've reached the Durrs.

19:07.031 --> 19:09.634
Mrs. Durr,
my name is Bob Zellner,

19:09.667 --> 19:12.502
<i>and I'm a student
over at Huntingdon College.</i>

19:14.672 --> 19:18.676
Everybody, everybody,
here he is!

19:18.710 --> 19:20.678
Mr. Bob Zellner

19:20.712 --> 19:23.581
of the illustrious
Huntingdon farm.

19:23.614 --> 19:26.017
Bob, I am so glad you called.

19:26.050 --> 19:29.587
I'm Virginia. This is my...
my husband, Clifford.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.455
- And you are?
- I'm Carol Ann Dunlap,

19:31.488 --> 19:32.890
Bob's fiance.

19:32.924 --> 19:34.959
- Hello, Bob.
- Mrs. Parks.

19:34.992 --> 19:37.260
Uh, and this is Aubrey Williams

19:37.294 --> 19:39.931
and his Yankee assistant
for the summer,

19:39.964 --> 19:41.833
Mr. Derek Ang.

19:41.866 --> 19:43.668
- The Communist.
- I know.

19:43.701 --> 19:46.369
- Where you from, Carol Ann?
- Union Springs.

19:46.403 --> 19:49.272
Any relationship to
Martin Dunlap?

19:49.306 --> 19:50.540
He's my grandaddy.

19:52.309 --> 19:54.779
Looks like you're moving up
in the world, Mr. Zellner.

19:56.581 --> 19:59.549
Well, y'all sure are stirring
up the Methodist wasp nest

19:59.584 --> 20:01.351
pretty good over there
at the college.

20:01.384 --> 20:02.620
Well, they're doing
all the stirring.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.021
We're just trying to
stay out of the way.

20:04.055 --> 20:05.189
A bunch of hypocrites.

20:05.223 --> 20:07.825
They stripped his right to give
the commencement speech.

20:07.859 --> 20:09.927
They'd like to kick him out
altogether.

20:09.961 --> 20:12.429
You know,
Clifford is an attorney.

20:13.030 --> 20:14.065
A lawyer?

20:14.098 --> 20:15.398
That's what they keep
telling me.

20:16.634 --> 20:20.004
Sir, over and over,
I get the feeling we broke the law.

20:20.037 --> 20:21.538
Because you did.

20:21.572 --> 20:22.940
- What law is that?
- Mm.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.843
They broke the law that
people don't have the rights

20:25.877 --> 20:28.980
to do anything the Ku Klux Klan
doesn't want them to do.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.848
Bunch of cowards.

20:30.882 --> 20:35.318
We have fought far tougher
enemies than them.

20:35.352 --> 20:37.387
We're still having
so much trouble with

20:37.420 --> 20:41.391
all these silly, scared
white men hiding under hoods.

20:41.424 --> 20:42.760
I just don't understand it.

20:42.794 --> 20:46.363
Well, if you understand
the Southern mind...

20:46.396 --> 20:48.099
Clifford, I believe
I have a Southern mind,

20:48.132 --> 20:50.101
and I believe I have
an understanding of it.

20:50.134 --> 20:53.871
Everybody here, with
the exception of Derek Ang,

20:53.905 --> 20:55.740
has a Southern mind.

20:55.773 --> 20:58.743
Even Bob knows
he broke the law of the KKK.

20:58.776 --> 21:00.978
Bob's more like you,
Mrs. Parks,

21:01.012 --> 21:03.346
when you refused to get up
from your seat.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.716
He didn't think all this was
gonna lead to anything.

21:05.750 --> 21:09.419
Yeah, I was just
a poor little seamstress

21:09.452 --> 21:10.955
tired from her day.

21:13.024 --> 21:14.391
Am I missing something?

21:15.159 --> 21:16.861
Are you saying...

21:16.894 --> 21:18.361
you knew
what you were doing?

21:18.395 --> 21:20.097
You think I am a child?

21:21.531 --> 21:24.068
We had to change
the bus laws.

21:24.101 --> 21:27.504
Therefore, somebody
had to refuse to get up.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.673
You knew, getting on that bus,

21:28.706 --> 21:30.107
that you were
gonna get arrested.

21:30.141 --> 21:32.844
Well, not that
particular bus and...

21:32.877 --> 21:36.513
I wasn't sure
I'd ever do it, but still...

21:36.546 --> 21:39.584
pretty interested to see
what rights I had or not.

21:39.617 --> 21:42.553
A lot of it was worked out
at Highlander.

21:42.587 --> 21:45.623
I read that Tennessee is
trying to shut the school down.

21:45.656 --> 21:47.024
- Oh, again?
- Highlander?

21:47.058 --> 21:50.127
It's a center
where people, Black and white,

21:50.161 --> 21:52.495
from all across the South

21:52.529 --> 21:57.168
come to work and study
political action together.

21:57.201 --> 21:58.501
And you've been up there?

21:58.535 --> 22:00.503
Oh, we've all been.
That's right.

22:01.672 --> 22:04.041
I really did know
what I was doing.

22:04.075 --> 22:05.910
Maybe you'll be up there soon.

22:05.943 --> 22:07.845
I'm sorry,
but I won't be going anywhere

22:07.879 --> 22:10.547
but up north
for graduate school in the fall.

22:10.581 --> 22:13.450
Is that so important
for you to do it right away?

22:13.483 --> 22:14.852
Yes, ma'am, it is.

22:14.886 --> 22:17.154
I mean, most of my family didn't
even make it through high school.

22:17.188 --> 22:19.790
So getting to go off
on a full scholarship

22:19.824 --> 22:21.993
to get a masters is
a pretty big deal.

22:22.026 --> 22:24.461
He has already
jeopardized that once.

22:24.494 --> 22:28.199
When we read about you
in the papers,

22:28.232 --> 22:30.533
we thought
we'd found somebody.

22:30.568 --> 22:32.637
Find somebody like who?

22:32.670 --> 22:35.538
We have a need
for somebody like Bob,

22:35.573 --> 22:38.843
somebody who could speak
to other white students

22:38.876 --> 22:40.144
throughout the South.

22:40.177 --> 22:43.681
I'm sure that's needed,
but we do have plans

22:43.714 --> 22:46.784
and none of them include
Bob ending up in jail.

22:46.817 --> 22:49.519
Things have got
to change, Bob.

22:49.553 --> 22:50.988
Mm-hm.
- I know you know that.

22:51.022 --> 22:53.090
I think we both know
that things have to change,

22:53.991 --> 22:55.092
don't we, Carol Ann?

22:56.661 --> 22:58.763
But maybe there's a better way.

22:58.796 --> 23:00.865
Without risking too much?

23:00.898 --> 23:03.466
Maybe. I mean,
we do live in a democracy.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.636
It's a republic, actually,

23:05.670 --> 23:08.139
which is what Germany was
when Hitler rose to power.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.741
In 1939, in Nazi Germany,

23:10.775 --> 23:14.578
they had a law that said all the Jews
were supposed to pack up their bags

23:14.612 --> 23:16.013
and get down
to the train depot.

23:17.615 --> 23:19.449
Now that seems like
a pretty good law to break,

23:20.151 --> 23:21.819
wouldn't you say?

23:21.852 --> 23:23.120
Where are you from?

23:23.154 --> 23:24.989
I'm from New York.

23:25.022 --> 23:27.892
But if you're looking
for somewhere more exotic,

23:27.925 --> 23:29.727
my family came over
from California.

23:32.529 --> 23:35.532
Well, what are you doing
all the way down here?

23:35.566 --> 23:38.202
Trying to find out where
they buried freedom, brother.

23:38.235 --> 23:39.469
What are you doing here?

23:42.640 --> 23:46.610
Well, that woman
was a handful.

23:46.644 --> 23:51.649
How arrogant to decide the fate
of people you never even met.

23:51.682 --> 23:54.552
We had our lives
all planned out for us in there.

23:55.853 --> 23:57.989
I did something
with somebody once.

24:00.057 --> 24:01.892
What are you talking about?

24:01.926 --> 24:04.862
I got in the wrong car
one day, and...

24:04.895 --> 24:06.163
we went nigger knocking.

24:14.805 --> 24:16.841
Ooh! You got her.

24:16.874 --> 24:18.876
Yeah, but the sumbitches
just broke my stick.

24:18.909 --> 24:20.211
Yeah, but what do you expect?

24:20.244 --> 24:22.213
That ain't a real
nigger-knocking stick.

24:22.246 --> 24:23.881
We got a bat in the back.
Boys, do you see it?

24:23.914 --> 24:25.282
You can hardly
hit 'em with this.

24:25.316 --> 24:26.784
Yeah, but when you do...

24:26.817 --> 24:27.852
Lookie there.

24:30.054 --> 24:32.023
Skeeter, get that bat.
Get that, boy.

24:35.092 --> 24:36.127
Get him.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.762
Ah! You missed him.

24:37.795 --> 24:40.664
- But he fell.
- Yeah, well, you still missed him.

24:44.335 --> 24:46.904
See that coon up there, Bob?

24:46.937 --> 24:49.573
- Yeah, I see him.
- I want you to get him.

24:49.607 --> 24:51.208
I don't know about this.

24:51.242 --> 24:53.711
You don't know?
What's there to know?

24:53.744 --> 24:55.146
About this sort of thing.

24:55.179 --> 24:58.582
Hey, this is in your blood.

24:58.616 --> 25:00.117
All right? This is where
you belong, boy.

25:01.385 --> 25:02.920
You grab that bat
and you do what's right.

25:02.953 --> 25:04.088
Bob, you gotta do this.

25:04.121 --> 25:05.189
I don't think so.

25:05.222 --> 25:08.359
Skeeter, you told me
he was the right kind of guy.

25:08.392 --> 25:10.928
Is he? Is he the right
kind of guy?

25:10.961 --> 25:12.696
Bob.

25:12.730 --> 25:14.131
Take the goddamn bat.

25:14.832 --> 25:16.067
Take it.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.702
You don't get that nigger,
we're gonna use that bat on you.

25:35.986 --> 25:37.655
How bad did you hurt
that kid?

25:37.688 --> 25:38.689
Bad.

25:54.138 --> 25:56.740
Hey! Hey!

25:58.209 --> 25:59.977
Need some help?

26:00.010 --> 26:01.178
You look like
you need some help.

26:03.347 --> 26:04.381
What's your game?

26:05.916 --> 26:08.385
No game.
Just being friendly.

26:10.754 --> 26:11.989
I know you
from somewhere?

26:12.022 --> 26:13.991
I-I don't think so.

26:14.024 --> 26:15.826
I got a bike
with a basket on it though.

26:16.393 --> 26:17.394
I see.

26:19.964 --> 26:21.165
What happened to your arm?

26:22.032 --> 26:23.033
I fell.

26:24.401 --> 26:26.203
<i>I should've told him
it was me.</i>

26:26.237 --> 26:28.706
I should have apologized,
but it's...

26:28.739 --> 26:30.741
hard to explain
to a perfect stranger

26:30.774 --> 26:33.878
why you do something
as senseless as that.

26:33.911 --> 26:35.779
I don't even know
why I did it.

26:35.813 --> 26:37.014
I was just...

26:37.982 --> 26:39.984
scared, I guess, but...

26:42.286 --> 26:43.721
looking at that boy...

26:45.389 --> 26:47.825
I wish it was me
they had beaten with that bat.

26:50.928 --> 26:52.930
We will continue
our Freedom Ride

26:52.963 --> 26:55.032
<i>from Birmingham
and onto Montgomery.</i>

26:55.065 --> 26:56.500
<i>And from there,
we plan to travel</i>

26:56.534 --> 27:00.204
<i>all the way to New Orleans with
a stop in Jackson, Mississippi.</i>

27:00.237 --> 27:01.238
<i>And do you expect</i>

27:01.272 --> 27:04.175
<i>the authorities in these cities
to allow that?</i>

27:04.208 --> 27:08.012
<i>Uh, I'm not certain
about the local authorities.</i>

27:08.045 --> 27:10.347
<i>We are testing the resolve
of the federal government</i>

27:10.381 --> 27:13.717
<i>to enforce the Interstate
Commerce Commission ruling,</i>

27:13.751 --> 27:18.122
<i>which gives each and every American citizen
the right to use the facilities equally.</i>

27:18.155 --> 27:20.758
<i>Aren't you concerned
that they'll burn this bus</i>

27:20.791 --> 27:23.894
<i>the same way they burned one
in Anniston just two days ago?</i>

27:23.928 --> 27:25.863
Acting like he's as good
as me.

27:27.531 --> 27:29.934
Well, I didn't take care
of the yellow bastards in Korea

27:29.967 --> 27:32.236
to be pushed around
by the Black ones back here.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.172
Weren't you a medic, Doc?

27:36.540 --> 27:38.876
Yes, I was.

27:38.909 --> 27:40.911
And I even saved some of
those Black sons of guns

27:40.945 --> 27:42.379
when they got
themselves shot up.

27:42.413 --> 27:44.148
Drug one, must have been
200 pounds,

27:44.181 --> 27:45.249
the length
of a football field.

27:45.282 --> 27:47.017
Bullets whizzing all
around our heads.

27:48.085 --> 27:50.221
Yeah, you do
crazy things in war.

27:50.254 --> 27:52.223
But we are not
in the war now.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.991
<i>How do you feel generally</i>

27:54.024 --> 27:55.993
<i>about Freedom Riders
and groups like that?</i>

27:56.026 --> 27:57.928
<i>I think they're just
asking for trouble.</i>

27:57.962 --> 27:59.330
<i>It's not gonna last too long</i>

27:59.363 --> 28:02.166
<i>before the people down here get
a little antagonized with it,</i>

28:02.199 --> 28:04.034
<i>and they're gonna take it
into their own hands.</i>

28:04.068 --> 28:07.204
<i>I just think we ought to have
open season on all of 'em.</i>

28:07.238 --> 28:09.406
<i>Freedom Riders are waiting
for a bus to take them</i>

28:09.440 --> 28:11.308
<i>to their next stop,
Montgomery, Alabama.</i>

28:11.342 --> 28:12.376
Where are you going?

28:12.409 --> 28:13.811
Are they crazy?

28:13.844 --> 28:16.447
Montgomery's gonna make Anniston
look like a Sunday go-to meeting.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.383
We already set up to create
as much protection as possible

28:19.416 --> 28:20.517
for them when they arrive.

28:20.551 --> 28:22.119
You got guns?

28:22.152 --> 28:23.887
We're gonna meet the bus

28:23.921 --> 28:26.857
and get everybody
into automobiles into safety

28:26.890 --> 28:28.158
just as quick as possible.

28:29.526 --> 28:32.396
I was hoping
that you might wanna volunteer.

28:32.429 --> 28:34.098
You must think
I've lost my mind.

28:34.131 --> 28:36.200
I'm going to go down and
meet 'em when they get here.

28:36.233 --> 28:37.669
You think you're invisible?

28:37.702 --> 28:41.405
All those folks down there are gonna
see is dark hair and dark skin,

28:41.438 --> 28:43.173
and they're gonna think
that you're a Freedom Rider.

28:45.509 --> 28:47.011
We could use you, Bob.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.886
You see the TV?
What would give somebody the courage

28:55.919 --> 28:58.122
to put their butts
in the frying pan like that?

29:00.592 --> 29:02.026
I couldn't do it.

29:02.059 --> 29:03.093
Derek...

29:04.361 --> 29:05.863
Why are you really down here?

29:05.896 --> 29:06.930
It's like you said.

29:07.931 --> 29:10.834
Black hair, darker skin.

29:10.868 --> 29:14.038
My family got brought over here
as labor too, you know.

29:14.071 --> 29:16.907
Well, yeah,
but they weren't slaves.

29:16.940 --> 29:17.975
Of course not.

29:19.611 --> 29:21.312
I'm fourth-generation American.

29:23.113 --> 29:25.983
Still, when I was a kid
during the war,

29:26.016 --> 29:29.086
my parents got me
to wear this sign every day.

29:29.119 --> 29:31.255
It said, "I am Chinese."

29:33.290 --> 29:34.291
That's strange.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.193
Not really.

29:38.663 --> 29:40.164
They didn't want me
to get arrested

29:40.197 --> 29:42.132
or get beaten up
for being Japanese.

29:44.368 --> 29:45.502
The sign.

29:47.004 --> 29:48.472
Scared the hell out of me.

29:48.505 --> 29:50.274
Want to know what's really
messed up, though?

29:53.678 --> 29:55.179
I was just so glad.

29:56.581 --> 29:58.349
So glad I wasn't Japanese.

30:00.217 --> 30:01.285
Them, not me.

30:02.052 --> 30:03.087
Them, not me.

30:05.456 --> 30:07.592
<i>The Greyhound
bus company has finally agreed</i>

30:07.625 --> 30:09.426
<i>to provide a driver
and a bus</i>

30:09.460 --> 30:12.630
<i>to carry the Freedom Riders
from Birmingham to Montgomery.</i>

30:12.664 --> 30:15.633
<i>They'll be escorted along the
way by Alabama State troopers,</i>

30:15.667 --> 30:17.334
<i>led by Floyd Mann.</i>

30:17.368 --> 30:20.237
<i>They should be arriving
in Montgomery soon.</i>

30:20.270 --> 30:22.539
- <i>Shoot. It's your nickel.</i>
- Bob,

30:22.574 --> 30:25.677
the Freedom Riders have
already left from Birmingham.

30:25.710 --> 30:27.478
I'm down at Clifford's office.

30:27.511 --> 30:29.380
Can you pick up Derek
at my house?

30:31.215 --> 30:33.050
You know,

30:33.083 --> 30:35.620
I never said I was gonna go
down there to get anybody.

30:35.653 --> 30:37.689
Why? Well, what's the matter?

30:37.722 --> 30:39.223
Well, I got the habit
of breathing,

30:39.256 --> 30:41.325
and I don't really
feel like giving it up too soon.

30:41.358 --> 30:43.260
So you don't care
what happens to them?

30:43.293 --> 30:45.329
This was their choosing.

30:45.362 --> 30:47.398
Okay, I get it.
Give me your keys.

30:47.431 --> 30:49.533
All right, simmer down.

30:49.567 --> 30:52.369
- I'll get you close.
- All right.

30:55.305 --> 30:57.575
- Are they here yet?
- They're here.

31:07.284 --> 31:09.019
Where's that police car going?

31:12.690 --> 31:14.626
God, this doesn't look right.

31:15.993 --> 31:17.227
Maybe it's early.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.501
- John Lewis!
- Excuse me, John Lewis!

31:34.411 --> 31:36.046
Mr. Lewis, please.
We have some questions.

31:36.079 --> 31:38.248
How can you possibly succeed
with so few of you?

31:56.133 --> 31:57.234
Non-violence.

31:57.267 --> 31:59.236
...be overcome by violence...

32:02.574 --> 32:06.711
<i>Freedom Riders have
landed on the shores of Montgomery.</i>

32:06.744 --> 32:09.581
<i>And at this very moment,
they're at the bus depot</i>

32:09.614 --> 32:12.549
<i>with their white cohorts
right there with them,</i>

32:12.584 --> 32:16.220
<i>not white Americans
but Red Army commies</i>

32:16.253 --> 32:19.456
<i>sent here directly
by the Kremlin.</i>

32:28.365 --> 32:30.802
- Get us outta here.
- I can't drive her.

32:30.835 --> 32:33.103
- These people will tear me apart.
- You can't leave us here.

32:33.136 --> 32:35.272
It'll look like I'm hitting her
with nothing but a purse.

32:40.110 --> 32:43.681
<i>They have arrived
with weapons, that I know.</i>

32:43.715 --> 32:46.116
<i>They are armed to the teeth.</i>

32:46.149 --> 32:47.752
<i>So take whatever you can grab,</i>

32:47.785 --> 32:50.755
<i>bats, chains,
sticks and bricks,</i>

32:50.788 --> 32:54.692
<i>get down there,
and stop these commies in their tracks.</i>

33:06.537 --> 33:08.539
Please! Please!
Stop it!

33:08.573 --> 33:12.175
Hey! Don't!
Please! Please!

33:18.348 --> 33:21.385
I bet you ain't happy you came
to Montgomery, now, boy.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.060
- Sweet Jesus!
- Oh!

33:31.796 --> 33:32.864
We don't know what happened,

33:32.897 --> 33:34.398
but you're finally here.
Thank God.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.634
Bob, you see that woman
in the pink dress?

33:36.668 --> 33:38.302
Her name is Jessica Mitford.

33:38.335 --> 33:39.236
Can you try and get her?

33:39.269 --> 33:41.606
Okay.
Wait. Where are you going?

33:41.639 --> 33:43.140
If you're going, I'm going.

33:43.775 --> 33:45.175
What?

33:46.611 --> 33:48.178
I'm only doing this once.

34:05.362 --> 34:07.130
Hey, you all right?

34:07.999 --> 34:09.766
Hey, are you...
Are you Jessica Mitford?

34:09.801 --> 34:12.135
- Who wants to know?
- I don't think it's the best place to...

34:12.168 --> 34:14.471
What do you think? That you and your
bullies here are gonna frighten me?

34:14.504 --> 34:15.873
I have seen...

34:16.505 --> 34:18.610
Let go of me this instant.

34:18.643 --> 34:21.110
Hey, I'm the press.
<i>Esquire</i> magazine.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.848
Virginia sent me.
She's right up there.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.882
Can you just walk away
from me this instant?

34:25.917 --> 34:27.585
Virginia Durr!

34:28.953 --> 34:30.755
- Who are you?
- Someone trying to keep you

34:30.788 --> 34:32.724
from getting your head busted.
Now come on!

34:35.726 --> 34:37.393
Get in.

34:38.328 --> 34:39.362
Let's go!

34:41.699 --> 34:44.467
- Are you okay?
- I can't believe you sent that young man to rescue me.

34:44.501 --> 34:45.902
I was completely fine.

34:45.937 --> 34:48.538
Slightest danger at all. You know,
there are some young girls out there.

34:48.572 --> 34:51.676
Ran into that building, the one with
the horribly reproduced Greek facade.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.409
Courthouse?

34:53.443 --> 34:54.746
They... They need some help.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.880
Bob?

34:56.914 --> 34:58.215
Well, hop to it. Go on.

34:59.817 --> 35:02.386
This is a formal injunction.

35:02.419 --> 35:04.555
I'm reading you the riot act.

35:04.589 --> 35:07.424
Forbidding persons named
and unnamed...

35:10.962 --> 35:12.262
This is a hearse.

35:24.341 --> 35:27.244
There'll be no killing
here today.

35:27.979 --> 35:30.615
This is over.

35:30.648 --> 35:33.250
Floyd Mann, you ain't
supposed to be here.

35:33.283 --> 35:35.787
We are not having
a discussion here.

35:35.820 --> 35:39.657
The next shot I fire
will not be a warning.

35:39.691 --> 35:41.926
...in the State of Alabama,
to engage

35:41.959 --> 35:44.662
in the so-called
Freedom Ride

35:44.696 --> 35:48.365
and other acts or conduct
calculated to promote

35:48.398 --> 35:49.901
breaches of the peace.

36:11.789 --> 36:13.825
Hey!

36:13.858 --> 36:15.927
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm here to get you.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.029
To get you out. But...

36:18.062 --> 36:19.797
We gotta skedaddle.
Come on.

36:46.791 --> 36:50.460
- I'm Bob.
- Very nice to meet you, Bob.

36:50.494 --> 36:52.830
Joanne. And behind you, Susan.

36:53.430 --> 36:54.999
- Hi.
- How you doing?

36:58.002 --> 36:59.336
You can put me down now.

36:59.369 --> 37:00.403
Oh, yup.

37:01.404 --> 37:02.405
All right.

37:05.676 --> 37:08.012
We're rolling.
Anytime you're ready, son.

37:08.045 --> 37:09.080
That's Jim.

37:09.113 --> 37:10.815
- <i>Segregation must be...</i>
- Oh, my Lord.

37:12.083 --> 37:15.418
<i>...stopped.
Must be broken down.</i>

37:17.622 --> 37:18.656
<i>Those of us...</i>

37:19.824 --> 37:21.058
<i>who were on the Freedom Ride...</i>

37:22.560 --> 37:23.895
<i>will continue to Freedom Ride.</i>

37:26.130 --> 37:29.033
<i>I'm not sure I'll be able to.</i>

37:29.066 --> 37:32.637
<i>But we're going on to New
Orleans, no matter what happens.</i>

37:34.437 --> 37:36.607
<i>We're dedicated to this.</i>

37:36.641 --> 37:38.308
<i>We'll take hitting,
we'll take beating.</i>

37:39.610 --> 37:40.878
<i>We're willing to accept death.</i>

37:43.047 --> 37:45.616
<i>But we're going to keep coming
until we can ride from...</i>

37:47.118 --> 37:48.485
<i>anywhere in the South</i>

37:50.520 --> 37:51.989
<i>to any place else
in the South...</i>

37:53.858 --> 37:54.892
<i>without anybody...</i>

37:56.160 --> 37:57.595
<i>making any comments.</i>

37:59.831 --> 38:01.431
<i>Just as American citizens.</i>

38:04.602 --> 38:06.971
- Where are you going?
- I need to borrow your car.

38:07.004 --> 38:09.506
- But where are you going?
- To the hospital.

38:09.539 --> 38:10.775
All right, well, I'm driving.

38:10.808 --> 38:12.475
- We should go too.
- I don't think so.

38:16.614 --> 38:17.982
So what's gonna happen next?

38:18.015 --> 38:19.584
We continue on.

38:19.617 --> 38:20.718
With the Freedom Ride?

38:20.751 --> 38:22.687
All the way to New Orleans.

38:22.720 --> 38:23.855
But yours is over at least.

38:23.888 --> 38:25.156
What are you talking about?

38:25.189 --> 38:26.924
Well, look at you.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.491
Freedom Ride is over.

38:28.525 --> 38:29.827
But we're still breathing.

38:31.195 --> 38:33.030
They got Jim Zwerg
up in that white ward

38:33.064 --> 38:34.665
and I don't think
he'll be coming,

38:34.699 --> 38:36.968
but we are getting back
on that bus tomorrow.

38:37.001 --> 38:37.869
That's crazy.

38:37.902 --> 38:40.137
Yeah, you know
what Mississippi is like?

38:40.171 --> 38:42.974
No. What's it like?

38:43.007 --> 38:45.710
After getting criticized
for being backwards,

38:45.743 --> 38:47.812
people from Georgia say,
"Thank God for Alabama."

38:47.845 --> 38:50.181
And in Alabama, we say,
"Thank God for Mississippi."

38:50.214 --> 38:52.016
So you think
it's gonna be rough?

38:52.049 --> 38:53.084
Suicide.

38:53.951 --> 38:55.586
Yeah. Yeah.

38:56.453 --> 38:57.420
You're probably right.

38:57.454 --> 39:00.423
But John and I
are getting back on that bus.

39:00.457 --> 39:01.792
Is our cause just?

39:03.628 --> 39:05.528
If so,
then you must ask yourself,

39:06.664 --> 39:08.398
"If not now, when?

39:10.001 --> 39:12.670
"If not me, then who?"

39:15.239 --> 39:17.708
Thank you, fellas,
for coming down.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.177
It means a lot.

39:22.647 --> 39:24.715

<i>In Montgomery,
an angry white mob</i>

40:12.163 --> 40:15.900
<i>is holding over a thousand people
inside the First Baptist Church,</i>

40:15.933 --> 40:17.201
<i>where they've come
to listen to speakers</i>

40:17.234 --> 40:20.104
<i>such as the Reverend Fred
Shuttlesworth of Birmingham.</i>

40:20.137 --> 40:22.106
<i>The most guilty man
in this state tonight</i>

40:22.139 --> 40:24.108
<i>is Governor John Patterson.</i>

40:24.141 --> 40:26.677
<i>The people of Alabama
are law-abiding citizens.</i>

40:26.711 --> 40:29.113
<i>Uh, these people that came
into Alabama,</i>

40:29.146 --> 40:31.182
<i>uh, were law violators.</i>

40:31.215 --> 40:33.050
<i>They created the breaches
of the peace</i>

40:33.084 --> 40:35.886
<i>and provoked the local people
into disturbances.</i>

40:35.920 --> 40:41.926
<i>US Attorney General
Robert Kennedy has engaged us</i>

40:41.959 --> 40:45.563
<i>and assured us
that he has the National Guard</i>

40:45.596 --> 40:49.200
coming here
to the Brick-a-Day Church now.

40:49.233 --> 40:51.602
<i>We must remain where we are</i>

40:51.635 --> 40:54.572
until they get here to protect.

40:54.605 --> 40:59.010
And despite what took place
at the bus depot earlier,

40:59.043 --> 41:02.512
despite the angry crowd
that surrounds us,

41:03.647 --> 41:06.283
we must remain nonviolent.

41:06.317 --> 41:09.653
Now, I know some of y'all
think you wanna strike back,

41:09.687 --> 41:11.555
that you might wanna
go blow-for-blow.

41:12.123 --> 41:14.125
But we cannot,

41:14.158 --> 41:17.728
- and we have to restrain others from doing so.
- Yes, yeah.

41:17.762 --> 41:20.564
We hold the moral
high ground.

41:20.598 --> 41:21.465
Yeah.

41:21.499 --> 41:24.602
And we intend to keep
that high ground,

41:24.635 --> 41:26.203
if ever we hope

41:26.237 --> 41:29.840
to transform America
into a better place.

41:29.874 --> 41:31.108
- Oh, yeah.
- Amen.

41:38.315 --> 41:39.316
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

41:43.287 --> 41:46.590
- It's beautiful down here.
- Yeah.

41:46.624 --> 41:48.592
Montgomery's a pretty town.

41:48.626 --> 41:50.861
With a pretty ugly side to it.

41:50.895 --> 41:54.365
Yeah. Well. that's probably
true everywhere.

41:54.398 --> 41:56.233
It's certainly true
in Nashville.

41:56.267 --> 41:57.868
Virginia gave me this.

41:57.902 --> 41:59.570
Found it inside.
Do you mind?

42:01.072 --> 42:03.908
I was an Eagle Scout.
I got a merit badge in first aid.

42:04.975 --> 42:07.144
Oh, all right then.

42:07.178 --> 42:09.880
As long as you've got
a merit badge.

42:18.923 --> 42:22.626
Before today, I'd never touched
a Southern white person before.

42:23.727 --> 42:25.963
And none ever touched me.

42:25.996 --> 42:27.665
How's that even possible?

42:27.698 --> 42:29.900
My father's a professor
of advanced mathematics.

42:29.934 --> 42:33.003
I grew up on campus,
all Black school.

42:33.037 --> 42:36.373
I did study in Paris, though.
There were all sorts of white people there.

42:36.407 --> 42:39.243
But they were different.

42:39.276 --> 42:42.012
There were more French
than white.

42:43.848 --> 42:47.318
Nobody's ever called
me a nigger

42:47.351 --> 42:52.123
<i>until I started sitting-in in the
lunch counters in Nashville last year.</i>

42:52.156 --> 42:54.658
Take your Black ass
off my stool!

42:54.692 --> 42:56.127
You know what
I thought then?

42:58.028 --> 43:00.064
<i>"No, they must be joking.</i>

43:00.998 --> 43:03.100
<i>"Don't they know who I am?</i>

43:03.134 --> 43:05.903
"I'm an associate professor.
I speak five languages."

43:05.936 --> 43:07.404
- How many you speak?
- Five.

43:07.905 --> 43:08.973
Wow.

43:13.844 --> 43:14.979
Can I ask you something?

43:16.780 --> 43:19.016
I've been told
that down here,

43:19.049 --> 43:22.153
white folks' hair smells like
chicken feathers when it gets wet.

43:22.186 --> 43:24.321
- Is that so?
- They told you what?

43:24.355 --> 43:26.090
Can I smell your
chicken-feathered hair?

43:26.123 --> 43:27.158
Just to see.

43:30.794 --> 43:32.163
I guess you better
wet it first.

43:33.063 --> 43:34.064
Okay.

43:37.334 --> 43:38.802
Oh!

43:43.274 --> 43:44.441
What is that?

43:47.077 --> 43:48.812
You smell like my cousin Elroy.

43:48.846 --> 43:51.982
Oh, yeah. He probably
uses Burma Shave.

43:52.283 --> 43:53.284
Mm.

43:54.285 --> 43:56.854
- Bob!
- Carol Ann!

43:59.056 --> 44:00.491
Is this where
you've been all day?

44:00.524 --> 44:02.059
No, I was...
I was downtown.

44:02.092 --> 44:03.394
- In the riot?
- Yeah.

44:03.427 --> 44:04.962
You cannot believe
what went down there.

44:04.995 --> 44:08.098
And who is this?

44:08.132 --> 44:10.334
Carol Ann, Joanne.
Joanne, this is...

44:10.367 --> 44:11.902
Can you excuse us a moment?

44:16.340 --> 44:17.975
What was she doing back there?

44:18.008 --> 44:19.977
She just wanted
to smell my hair.

44:20.010 --> 44:22.446
- For what reason?
- Just see if I smelled like a chicken.

44:22.479 --> 44:24.481
Look, Carol Ann,
these are the craziest human beings

44:24.515 --> 44:25.584
I think I've ever met.

44:25.617 --> 44:27.885
They're actually planning
on getting back on the bus

44:27.918 --> 44:29.420
to go on to Mississippi.

44:29.453 --> 44:32.056
It's like they're running
a three-legged dog.

44:32.089 --> 44:34.191
They think they're gonna beat the pack.
They are something.

44:34.225 --> 44:35.993
So what is it
you're telling me?

44:36.026 --> 44:37.895
You wanna go get on a
Greyhound with these people

44:37.928 --> 44:40.397
so some old redneck
can beat the hell out of you?

44:40.431 --> 44:41.365
No, I'm not saying that.

44:41.398 --> 44:43.467
I'm... I'm just telling you,
I admire 'em.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.802
Yeah, it's admirable.

44:46.170 --> 44:48.539
Now, let's go
get back to campus.

44:48.573 --> 44:50.040
Not tonight.

44:53.444 --> 44:56.347
Oh, no, Carol Ann.
Don't go thinking that.

44:56.380 --> 44:59.316
Do not get all caught up.

44:59.350 --> 45:01.785
You will ruin our lives
if you get caught up in this.

45:01.819 --> 45:02.820
I know.

45:04.855 --> 45:05.990
You're scaring me, Bob.

45:12.062 --> 45:14.865
It was incredible. Amazing.

45:14.898 --> 45:18.202
One of the most exhilarating
experiences of my entire existence.

45:18.235 --> 45:20.237
You really shouldn't
have missed it.

45:20.271 --> 45:22.873
- You want a coffee?
- Marvelous idea. Black.

45:22.906 --> 45:24.241
Get him one too.

45:24.275 --> 45:26.443
Dear girl, how did you get back?

45:26.477 --> 45:28.012
I didn't hear my car drive up.

45:28.045 --> 45:30.981
I have a little Nash Rambler
back in California.

45:31.015 --> 45:32.483
I can drive it here for you.

45:32.516 --> 45:34.318
- Why would you do that?
- The brakes are good.

45:34.351 --> 45:36.420
The real problem
is just getting it started.

45:36.453 --> 45:39.156
What are you talking about?
Where is my car?

45:39.189 --> 45:41.258
They burned it, all right?
We did everything.

45:41.292 --> 45:42.960
Everything we could
to stop them, didn't we, Dickie?

45:42.993 --> 45:44.562
You parked right
in front of the church.

45:44.596 --> 45:47.298
I told you to park
three or four blocks away.

45:47.331 --> 45:49.133
You did! You did, darling.
I know you did...

45:49.166 --> 45:50.434
I'm glad you're in one piece.

45:50.467 --> 45:53.037
It's just that Clifford
is gonna wanna kill you.

45:53.070 --> 45:56.273
They're taking the bus down
to Jackson, Mississippi, later.

45:56.307 --> 45:58.409
- They're leaving today?
- Who's leaving?

45:59.476 --> 46:01.445
Those who aren't too badly hurt.

46:01.478 --> 46:04.148
And a handful of volunteers
to take the place of the others.

46:04.181 --> 46:06.183
Did somebody volunteer for me?

46:06.216 --> 46:07.451
I think so, yeah.

46:07.484 --> 46:09.153
Well, nobody needs
to take my place.

46:09.186 --> 46:10.487
Were they from Montgomery?

46:10.521 --> 46:14.058
Mostly. A reporter took
everybody's name down who's riding.

46:15.192 --> 46:17.428
I gotta get some sleep.

46:19.196 --> 46:20.331
Hold on to this for me.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.903
Virginia, I think I found
a picture of your car.

46:25.936 --> 46:28.439
- Derek Ang.
- He's one of the volunteers.

46:29.540 --> 46:32.009
Sweet Lord Jesus.

46:32.042 --> 46:35.079
Put everything back, Bob.
You're not going anywhere!

46:35.112 --> 46:37.281
- Okay!
- I don't have to tell you

46:37.314 --> 46:38.549
that this is crazy!

46:38.583 --> 46:41.919
- This is crazy!
- Yep. You're right.

46:41.952 --> 46:43.588
I forbid this.

46:43.621 --> 46:45.557
Do not walk out that door!

46:47.191 --> 46:48.593
You stop right now!

46:49.460 --> 46:52.396
I am talking to you. Bob!

46:52.429 --> 46:54.531
Put down that suitcase.

46:54.566 --> 46:55.667
I'm warning you, Bob.

46:55.700 --> 46:58.402
You go down to that bus depot
and you get on that bus,

46:58.435 --> 47:00.537
and we are over! Done!

47:02.272 --> 47:04.441
- We're done?
- Your decision.

47:08.245 --> 47:10.147
Well, in that case,

47:11.215 --> 47:12.549
I'll try and be back
in a few days.

47:13.585 --> 47:14.586
Bob!

47:25.996 --> 47:27.264
- I want to get on that bus.
- Mm-mm.

47:27.297 --> 47:28.566
Uh-uh.

47:50.555 --> 47:52.489
<i>Jackson citizens
watched by the hundreds,</i>

47:52.523 --> 47:54.692
<i>jostling each other
for a better view.</i>

47:54.726 --> 47:57.027
<i>The Freedom Riders
stepped off the bus,</i>

47:57.060 --> 48:00.598
<i>some still bearing the bandages
of their encounter with Alabama.</i>

48:00.632 --> 48:02.634
<i>A policeman ordered
them to move on.</i>

48:02.667 --> 48:06.571
<i>Then each was arrested and led
outside to a waiting paddy wagon.</i>

48:06.604 --> 48:10.207
<i>The charges were breach of
the peace and inciting to riot.</i>

48:10.240 --> 48:12.610
<i>The trial was short.
The sentence...</i>

48:12.644 --> 48:13.678
Leave it alone.

48:13.711 --> 48:14.978
<i>...which was suspended.</i>

48:15.012 --> 48:17.080
<i>The Real McCoys</i> is about to come on.
That's my favorite show.

48:17.114 --> 48:19.584
And I'll break your arm
if you touch that TV.

48:21.653 --> 48:23.655
Well, you really are something, Bob.
You know that?

48:24.556 --> 48:25.557
Carol Ann.

48:27.625 --> 48:29.059
That could have been you.

48:30.562 --> 48:33.163
I'm glad you decided
to come to your senses.

48:33.698 --> 48:35.232
I didn't.

48:35.265 --> 48:38.135
Bus was leaving by the time I got
there, and they wouldn't let me through.

48:39.571 --> 48:43.073
You really meant to go off
and get yourself arrested?

48:43.106 --> 48:46.376
You know what I felt when I
saw I couldn't get on that bus?

48:46.410 --> 48:49.581
Relieved.
My head was saying, "Thank God.

48:49.614 --> 48:51.548
"Thank God. Thank you, Jesus."

48:51.583 --> 48:55.185
That's right. Thank you, Jesus.

48:55.219 --> 48:56.721
What do you think Jesus
would have done in my place?

48:56.754 --> 48:59.156
You are not Jesus, Bob.

48:59.189 --> 49:00.324
You got that right.

49:00.357 --> 49:02.059
That's John Lewis.

49:02.092 --> 49:04.562
That man right there.
You see him?

49:04.596 --> 49:06.163
Virginia Durr told me
he's a minister.

49:06.196 --> 49:07.464
He doesn't look old enough,
does he?

49:07.498 --> 49:10.668
Well, he's the first real man
of God I think I've ever met.

49:10.702 --> 49:12.704
Oh, so he's Jesus?

49:13.605 --> 49:15.272
No, he's a man.

49:17.441 --> 49:19.811
But me, I was afraid
to get on that bus.

49:19.844 --> 49:22.412
- What does that make me?
- Reasonable.

49:25.182 --> 49:26.651
I was in a riot two days ago,

49:27.852 --> 49:30.254
and I walked
right through it unharmed.

49:30.855 --> 49:32.289
And I know why.

49:32.322 --> 49:34.091
It's 'cause I'm just like
everybody else.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.094
You know what I think
most of the time?

49:37.127 --> 49:40.097
"It ain't happening to me.
So it's okay."

49:40.130 --> 49:42.800
It should be my motto,
just get it tattooed on my body someplace.

49:42.834 --> 49:46.103
- "Not my problem."
- What is the point you're trying to make?

49:46.136 --> 49:47.504
I'm gonna go call
these people up right now.

49:47.538 --> 49:49.339
Find out what
they're really about.

49:49.373 --> 49:50.775
And I know that
you're not gonna like that,

49:50.808 --> 49:51.676
but that's what I'm gonna do.

49:51.709 --> 49:54.244
Well, if that's all
you do, it's okay.

49:54.278 --> 49:56.213
I'm not asking
your permission, Carol Ann.

49:56.246 --> 49:57.615
And that's just it.

49:57.649 --> 50:00.551
I'm capable of doing a lot of
things you're not gonna approve of.

50:00.585 --> 50:03.621
I am trying to preserve the life
we've been planning together.

50:03.655 --> 50:05.355
Is that at all
meaningful to you?

50:05.389 --> 50:06.991
I think about it constantly.

50:07.025 --> 50:10.562
There's a voice in my head saying, "Get
back in line, you dumb ass country boy."

50:10.595 --> 50:12.396
So what is it
you want to do?

50:12.429 --> 50:14.599
You wanna go off,
get yourself arrested,

50:14.632 --> 50:17.669
jeopardize your whole life
for some grand principle?

50:17.702 --> 50:19.804
Isn't that what they're doing?

50:19.837 --> 50:21.606
I mean, they're my age!

50:21.639 --> 50:23.440
Half of them are in college too.

50:23.473 --> 50:25.142
So how is it that
they can do it?

50:25.175 --> 50:26.678
And what about me?

50:26.711 --> 50:28.111
You wanna give me up too?

50:28.145 --> 50:30.582
No, I don't. I just,
I got to do something

50:30.615 --> 50:32.182
and I don't see you
putting up with that.

50:38.823 --> 50:41.693
You had me fooled
for a long time, Bob Zellner.

50:41.726 --> 50:43.527
I really thought
you were gonna be somebody.

50:43.561 --> 50:44.596
I thought you had ambition.

50:44.629 --> 50:48.298
But you are nothing
but a dumb ass country boy.

50:48.332 --> 50:51.869
And maybe it's all right for you to
end up living life in a shotgun shack,

50:51.903 --> 50:54.639
trying to save the world.
But that has never been my dream.

50:56.540 --> 50:59.276
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

50:59.309 --> 51:01.511
We both know
you're not anybody's savior.

51:08.418 --> 51:10.622
Well, the niggers aren't
on TV anymore, are they?

51:10.655 --> 51:12.824
<i>This is</i> The Real McCoys.

51:12.857 --> 51:16.360
Starring Walter Brennan,
created by Irving Pincus...

51:21.231 --> 51:23.166
Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.637
- Yes, is this the SNCC office?
- Yes, it is.

51:25.670 --> 51:29.506
We'd like to thank you, Father,
for this blessed meal you've set before us.

51:29.539 --> 51:31.909
I'm calling from Alabama.

51:31.943 --> 51:35.278
I was wondering if you needed
volunteers for the summer.

51:35.312 --> 51:38.448
We'd like to ask that you keep
an eye on our second eldest, Bob,

51:39.549 --> 51:41.351
who's leaving to take up arms

51:41.385 --> 51:44.187
and to fight
for freedom and justice.

51:44.221 --> 51:46.456
We could use you.
How soon can you get over here?

51:46.490 --> 51:48.325
I can be there in a few days.

51:48.358 --> 51:50.962
You know our son,
Lord, I'm sure that you know

51:50.995 --> 51:55.432
that he is headstrong,
a fighter, and resolute.

51:57.434 --> 51:59.369
First of all, Lord,
he is righteous.

52:01.706 --> 52:03.608
Please walk with him
and keep him safe.

52:04.709 --> 52:05.743
Amen.

52:05.777 --> 52:07.310
Amen.

52:08.613 --> 52:11.949
Bob, darling,
take care of yourself.

52:11.983 --> 52:16.353
I mean, there's no reason for you to
go out of your way to get in trouble.

52:16.386 --> 52:20.223
Going away to school in a few weeks.
Remember that.

52:20.257 --> 52:21.759
- Okay?
- What's going on here?

52:21.793 --> 52:23.695
You're acting like
I'm going off to war.

52:41.846 --> 52:44.615
<i>I'm sorry
I wasn't there at graduation.</i>

52:44.649 --> 52:46.550
<i>I just couldn't go.</i>

52:46.584 --> 52:47.852
<i>I couldn't face it.</i>

52:47.885 --> 52:51.656
Hey, Bob, you start applying
for work as a nigger-lover yet?

52:51.689 --> 52:54.726
Now, what's that all about?
You still up to something?

52:54.759 --> 52:57.461
Nah, they're just
fooling around.

52:57.494 --> 52:59.630
Calling you a nigger-lover,
is just fooling around?

52:59.664 --> 53:02.432
Don't listen to them, son.
They're white trash.

53:02.466 --> 53:03.868
It means nothing, Daddy.

53:03.901 --> 53:04.902
You know how people are.

53:04.936 --> 53:07.437
Listen, I don't wanna
find out that my grandson

53:07.471 --> 53:09.339
is trying to help
the niggers take over.

53:09.372 --> 53:10.842
Not that you would
tell me about it.

53:12.442 --> 53:15.613
<i>It was supposed to mark
the beginning of our life together,</i>

53:16.080 --> 53:18.548
<i>truly together.</i>

53:18.583 --> 53:22.019
<i>And I can see now
it was really marking the end.</i>

53:22.053 --> 53:24.789
<i>Mama wants me
back in Union Springs,</i>

53:24.822 --> 53:27.357
<i>and I'm going back
for now.</i>

53:27.390 --> 53:30.494
<i>Don't come to find me.
I don't want to see you.</i>

53:31.996 --> 53:33.965
<i>I hope you find your way
when you get out there.</i>

54:39.764 --> 54:40.932
I'm leaving today.

54:42.432 --> 54:43.868
I think.

54:43.901 --> 54:46.070
I'll let you know
if I get on that bus.

54:46.804 --> 54:47.805
Bye.

54:50.641 --> 54:52.677
Bob Zellner.

54:52.710 --> 54:54.145
You're the phone call
from Alabama?

54:54.178 --> 54:55.478
Yes, sir.

54:55.512 --> 54:56.581
The volunteer?

54:58.448 --> 54:59.684
You expecting somebody else?

54:59.717 --> 55:02.086
You know,
I gotta admit, I was.

55:03.588 --> 55:04.856
You know what we do here?

55:04.889 --> 55:06.389
You're a freedom organization.

55:07.024 --> 55:08.893
And you're Southern?

55:08.926 --> 55:10.828
Alabama born and raised.

55:10.862 --> 55:12.930
All right, Alabama.

55:12.964 --> 55:14.397
Well, listen.

55:14.431 --> 55:16.033
I gotta catch a bus.

55:16.067 --> 55:18.636
Here are the keys
to the office.

55:19.604 --> 55:21.639
Notepad, pencil.

55:21.672 --> 55:22.673
Most important thing.

55:24.541 --> 55:26.177
Guard this briefcase.

55:26.210 --> 55:27.912
Never let it out of your sight.

55:27.945 --> 55:29.881
When you leave,
take it with you.

55:29.914 --> 55:31.148
I'll guard it with my life.

55:31.182 --> 55:34.719
You don't have to do all
that, but don't lose it.

55:34.752 --> 55:35.853
Everything's in there.

55:40.992 --> 55:43.027
You better be on
the up and up, Alabama.

55:45.897 --> 55:47.798
Oh, uh...

55:47.832 --> 55:50.601
sorry... what am I
supposed to do?

55:50.635 --> 55:52.737
Well, you open up the office
around 8:00 a.m.,

55:52.770 --> 55:54.105
stay until about 5:30,

55:54.138 --> 55:56.073
and in between,
you answer the phones.

55:56.107 --> 55:58.576
- Okay.
- You take all the phone messages.

55:58.609 --> 56:01.612
Who's calling, who they're calling
for, and what they want.

56:03.614 --> 56:05.548
Um, what about the briefcase?

56:05.583 --> 56:08.219
Just keep it with you. When somebody
comes, they'll know what to do with it.

56:08.252 --> 56:09.921
- Well, who's coming?
- I don't know.

56:09.954 --> 56:11.622
- Well, when are you gonna be back?
- I won't be.

56:16.928 --> 56:21.065
- <i>McDew?</i>
- Uh, I think McDew just left.

56:21.098 --> 56:24.467
- <i>Oh, who is this?</i>
- Bob Zellner.

56:24.501 --> 56:25.937
<i>From where?</i>

56:25.970 --> 56:27.470
East Brewton, Alabama.

56:27.504 --> 56:29.874
<i>Uh, I don't wanna
insult you, but, uh...</i>

56:29.907 --> 56:31.909
- <i>You sound white.</i>
- I get that a lot.

56:31.943 --> 56:34.946
<i>All right, I... I got a message
for Bob Moses.</i>

56:34.979 --> 56:37.682
- <i>Um, you think you could...</i>
- Go ahead.

56:37.715 --> 56:38.783
<i>Um...</i>

58:07.304 --> 58:10.007
Uh, Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.

58:10.041 --> 58:11.208
Bob Zellner speaking.

58:13.277 --> 58:14.544
Who is this?

58:15.279 --> 58:16.914
Bob Zellner.

58:16.947 --> 58:18.649
Did I call
the right number?

58:18.682 --> 58:20.751
This is the SNCC office, right?

58:20.785 --> 58:22.186
Yes, it is.

58:22.219 --> 58:23.554
Don't move.

58:39.970 --> 58:41.806
Burma Shave!

58:41.839 --> 58:44.842
- Hey, Joanne.
- What in God's creation are you doing here?

58:58.089 --> 59:00.958
<i>America's
favorite family comedy,</i>

59:00.991 --> 59:03.327

59:09.300 --> 59:12.336
Hey, how do you like
your new room?

59:12.369 --> 59:14.038
It's a lot better than the Y.

59:15.439 --> 59:18.843
- You play?
- Do you?

59:18.876 --> 59:20.845
Because I'm a Negro,
I shouldn't know how to play chess?

59:20.878 --> 59:22.012
I didn't mean it like that.

59:22.046 --> 59:24.048
Oh, because I'm a girl.

59:24.081 --> 59:25.916
I get it. Sit down.

59:30.921 --> 59:32.823
I'm gonna let you know,
I'm pretty good.

59:32.857 --> 59:34.325
Uh-huh. We'll see.

59:49.406 --> 59:54.011
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

59:59.116 --> 01:00:01.886
You know, this movement

01:00:01.919 --> 01:00:04.755
voting rights and being able
to eat at Woolworths.

01:00:04.788 --> 01:00:06.957
Check. Don't go easy on me.

01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:12.296
You don't have to worry
about that.

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:15.699
Check. Look, we're trying
to change the world, Bob.

01:00:15.733 --> 01:00:17.201
Have you read
Jean-Paul Sartre?

01:00:18.135 --> 01:00:19.803
No. Never heard of him.

01:00:21.805 --> 01:00:24.742
Well, you've got
a lot of studying to do.

01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:27.411
- Checkmate.
- Yeah.

01:00:27.444 --> 01:00:28.445
Wanna go again?

01:00:29.446 --> 01:00:31.749
Well, it is getting pretty late.

01:00:31.782 --> 01:00:34.084
Chicken hair,
are you getting chicken?

01:00:35.786 --> 01:00:37.154
Oh, don't be a sore loser.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.394
- SNCC office.
- <i>Bob!</i>

01:00:44.828 --> 01:00:47.998
- Grandaddy?
- <i>I'm downstairs, god damn it!</i>

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:58.909
- Grandaddy?
- Hey.

01:00:58.943 --> 01:01:02.413
Is there a place where a white man
can go and sit down around here?

01:01:02.446 --> 01:01:04.014
There's a park.

01:01:04.048 --> 01:01:06.183
Park? Good idea.

01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:08.752
But he told me
you've gone nigger crazy.

01:01:08.786 --> 01:01:12.389
He saw you with a Negress
walking down the street.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.926
I'm just helping some people out
for the summer.

01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:19.763
Ah, let's call
a spade a spade.

01:01:20.965 --> 01:01:22.499
They're called niggers.

01:01:24.868 --> 01:01:27.972
With your delicate sensibilities
you want me to call them,

01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:29.540
what, Negroes?

01:01:31.508 --> 01:01:32.943
Whatever you choose.

01:01:34.912 --> 01:01:37.248
Bob, I've known Negroes
all my life.

01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:39.149
I got nothing against them.

01:01:39.183 --> 01:01:42.052
Now, you might think because I'm
in the Klan, I'm against the Negro.

01:01:42.086 --> 01:01:43.921
I'm not against the Negro.

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:46.423
I'm for the white race,
that's all.

01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:48.192
As any decent white man
should be.

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:50.794
Hell, you know history.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:52.863
History teaches us
the white race

01:01:52.896 --> 01:01:55.032
pulled humanity out of the muck

01:01:55.065 --> 01:01:57.234
and gave the world civilization.

01:01:57.268 --> 01:01:59.803
Hell, they don't
understand civilization.

01:01:59.837 --> 01:02:03.073
Not them. Not their fault.

01:02:03.107 --> 01:02:04.942
Christ, they're barely
out of the jungle themselves.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.944
A couple of hundred years.

01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:09.581
That's why we just,
we can't mix in with them.

01:02:09.614 --> 01:02:12.049
Hell, I don't want to, anyway.

01:02:12.082 --> 01:02:14.318
I don't want to sit with them.
I don't want to eat with them.

01:02:14.351 --> 01:02:15.953
I don't want to pray with them

01:02:15.986 --> 01:02:17.921
or ride on the goddamn train.

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:21.992
I prefer not even to see them.

01:02:22.026 --> 01:02:24.895
That's my cross to bear,
I guess.

01:02:24.928 --> 01:02:26.864
It's a colored organization.
I work for 'em.

01:02:26.897 --> 01:02:29.433
It's called the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

01:02:32.102 --> 01:02:34.371
But what the hell do you
hope to accomplish with that?

01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:39.577
Eating, sitting, praying, riding trains
together. The whole kit and caboodle.

01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:42.346
The Southern way of life,
you just throw that away and just

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:44.315
stomp that
into the ground, right?

01:02:44.348 --> 01:02:45.983
It's gonna happen, Grandaddy.

01:02:47.184 --> 01:02:49.486
I've met the people changing
everything, and they're...

01:02:51.388 --> 01:02:53.123
you can't stop them.

01:02:53.157 --> 01:02:54.458
They are tougher,

01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:58.529
they are stronger, they're more
resilient, and they're right.

01:02:58.563 --> 01:03:00.598
You trying to tell me
that the Klan can't

01:03:00.632 --> 01:03:04.068
beat a few niggers
back into line?

01:03:04.101 --> 01:03:07.071
Hey, hell. That's hardly even
gonna be a fight.

01:03:07.104 --> 01:03:08.472
I wouldn't count on that.

01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:10.140
They're gonna bury Jim Crow.

01:03:10.174 --> 01:03:12.242
The only funerals
are gonna be for these...

01:03:12.276 --> 01:03:15.145
these commie niggers.

01:03:15.179 --> 01:03:17.147
And to tell you the truth, son,

01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:19.983
you're on that
slippery slope yourself.

01:03:20.017 --> 01:03:21.985
I'm really only here
to tell you something, Bob.

01:03:22.019 --> 01:03:24.589
I need to tell you this
face-to-face, man-to-man.

01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:28.125
You come to Birmingham
to march, protesting,

01:03:28.158 --> 01:03:31.061
sit-in in a bus depot,

01:03:31.095 --> 01:03:34.064
I'll put a bullet through
your head my own damn self.

01:03:34.666 --> 01:03:37.134
You understand me? Huh?

01:03:38.335 --> 01:03:40.170
You've fallen off the path, son.

01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:45.075
We got eyes on you, Bob.

01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:48.045
We got eyes on you,
god damn it. Got it?

01:03:52.116 --> 01:03:54.284
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.122
Well, are you gonna
introduce us?

01:03:58.155 --> 01:04:01.559
Joanne, this is my grandfather.
Grandaddy, this is Joanne.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.361
Certainly nice to meet you.

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.432
What am I looking at here, Bob?

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:09.933
We better go.

01:04:10.635 --> 01:04:12.369
I'll tell Daddy you said hi.

01:04:54.378 --> 01:04:56.480
SNCC office. Bob Zellner here.

01:04:56.513 --> 01:04:58.716
Well, yeah. All right.
Mr. Zellner,

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.085
this is Mr. Herbert Lee
from McComb, Mississippi.

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:05.189
Well, I know you're not calling for me.
Would you like to leave a message?

01:05:05.222 --> 01:05:08.660
Well, yes, I would.
I'm trying to find Bob Moses.

01:05:08.693 --> 01:05:11.563
Uh, he's helping us with
voting registration over here.

01:05:11.596 --> 01:05:12.931
He's supposed to be
back last week

01:05:12.963 --> 01:05:16.768
and I hadn't heard a thing from him.
Would you know where he is?

01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:21.205
<i>I wish I did.
Everybody's calling for him.</i>

01:05:21.238 --> 01:05:23.474
<i>And that's about all
I can tell you.</i>

01:05:23.507 --> 01:05:26.578
You sound kind of troubled, son.
Everything all right?

01:05:26.611 --> 01:05:28.580
No, sir, it's not.

01:05:28.613 --> 01:05:30.648
<i>Well, you know, this work
can get rough sometimes.</i>

01:05:30.682 --> 01:05:32.316
I've never done
anything like this

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.318
and I know that
we don't know each other,

01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:38.222
but I just don't know
what I'm doing here.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:42.092
<i>I hear you, son.
I hear you. I hear you.</i>

01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.261
I'm bored to tears.

01:05:44.294 --> 01:05:45.663
Bored?

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:48.298
It ain't anything like what it
looks like in the papers, Mr. Lee.

01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:56.139
Oh. Mr. Lee, um, I gotta go.

01:05:56.173 --> 01:05:57.809
I'm sure this is costing you
an arm and leg anyways,

01:05:57.842 --> 01:05:59.376
but I'll get your message
to Bob Moses.

01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:02.479
Thank you, son.
Um, I appreciate you.

01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:07.217
- You are?
- Bob Zellner.

01:06:07.251 --> 01:06:09.253
East Brewton, Alabama.

01:06:09.286 --> 01:06:14.157
Okay. Bob Zellner, East Brewton,
Alabama. I'm Jim Forman.

01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:18.295
Oh, shoot. Am I glad to see you.
I got nothing but messages here.

01:06:18.328 --> 01:06:20.264
You've been taking messages?

01:06:21.098 --> 01:06:23.568
Yeah, that's about all
I've been doing.

01:06:23.601 --> 01:06:26.203
- Well, how did you get in here?
- <i>He gave me the keys.</i>

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.606
Who in God's name
gave you keys?

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.809
McDew. I think McDew.
He didn't tell me. I just gathered...

01:06:31.843 --> 01:06:34.111
No, don't say another word.

01:06:38.215 --> 01:06:41.853
This is June 22nd, 1961.
This is Jim Forman.

01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:44.388
I'm here in the SNCC
headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia,

01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:48.191
with Mr. Bob Zellner. From?

01:06:48.225 --> 01:06:49.661
East Brewton, Alabama.

01:06:49.694 --> 01:06:52.664
And East Brewton,
is a pretty small place?

01:06:52.697 --> 01:06:55.098
Well, not so small
you could spit across it.

01:06:55.132 --> 01:06:58.803
Can I assume that East Brewton,
like much of Alabama,

01:06:58.836 --> 01:07:01.806
is segregated with
a healthy share of racism?

01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:04.809
- Well, that and then some.
- Okay, but not you?

01:07:07.579 --> 01:07:09.279
I don't think
I understand the question.

01:07:09.313 --> 01:07:14.284
Okay, well, can you recall your
earliest memories of race?

01:07:14.318 --> 01:07:16.754
- You know, I can.
- Well, what was it?

01:07:16.788 --> 01:07:20.625
I was about
four years old,

01:07:20.658 --> 01:07:24.394
shopping with my mother at a
downtown store where everybody went.

01:07:24.428 --> 01:07:25.395
Mm-hmm.

01:07:25.429 --> 01:07:28.398
My mother just bought me
a little water pistol.

01:07:28.432 --> 01:07:31.134
I spotted a fountain
pretty close to my own height

01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:32.737
to go fill it up.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.138
And so I turn the lever
for that water,

01:07:35.172 --> 01:07:36.841
get that little
water pistol open,

01:07:36.874 --> 01:07:38.710
and just as I'm about
to fill that thing up,

01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:40.912
a pair of hands grabs me
from behind,

01:07:40.945 --> 01:07:43.347
turns me around.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.651
It was a woman, never
seen her before in my life.

01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:48.653
Perfect stranger.
She said to me...

01:07:48.686 --> 01:07:51.488
That water fountain's
not for little white boys.

01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:53.357
You see that sign over there?

01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:54.859
That says "colored"

01:07:54.892 --> 01:07:57.729
and that sign over there,
that says "white"

01:07:57.762 --> 01:07:59.463
and that's what you are.

01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:00.932
Don't let anybody catch you

01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:03.166
drinking out of
the colored fountain.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.571
If you want a drink of water,
just ask anybody to lift you up.

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:08.472
Indoctrination.

01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:10.708
- Go along to get along.
- Mm.

01:08:12.476 --> 01:08:15.545
So you really didn't have much
to do with Black folks?

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.180
Oh, yeah, I did. Yeah.

01:08:18.215 --> 01:08:21.586
The South is a funny place.

01:08:21.618 --> 01:08:24.889
You know, I worked
in a general store.

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:27.925
<i>I waited on Black folks
as I did white folks.</i>

01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:30.595
There's not a whole lot of
separation between the races there.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:32.796
There were definitely rules
to abide by, though.

01:08:33.865 --> 01:08:35.933
What rules were those?

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:38.670
I couldn't carry anything
out to a Negro customer

01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:40.470
even if they were
old and feeble,

01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:42.538
no matter how heavy it was.

01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:44.609
I could if there weren't
any white people around.

01:08:45.576 --> 01:08:49.479
And, uh, I had to see
to the white folks

01:08:49.513 --> 01:08:51.381
before seeing any
of the Black customers,

01:08:51.415 --> 01:08:54.819
no matter how long they've been
standing there, that sort of thing.

01:08:54.852 --> 01:08:58.255
So how is it that
you are here, Bob Zellner,

01:08:58.287 --> 01:09:00.858
instead of out somewhere
kicking Negro ass?

01:09:00.892 --> 01:09:02.459
That will be my daddy.

01:09:03.326 --> 01:09:04.562
I think, yeah.

01:09:04.595 --> 01:09:06.764
He's a minister,
and he was in the Klan.

01:09:08.465 --> 01:09:11.535
Let me explain.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:15.673
My daddy went on a cultural exchange
in the '30s to the Soviet Union.

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:17.875
And he was there
for a long time,

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:19.341
and he was starting
to get homesick,

01:09:19.376 --> 01:09:24.548
and one day, he hears that there's
a Baptist gospel choir from Georgia

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:26.917
performing at
the same town that he was in.

01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:29.687
I can tell you I was pretty excited
to see some folks from home.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.889
But when I got there...

01:09:32.724 --> 01:09:35.292
turns out that
it was this Black choir.

01:09:36.027 --> 01:09:37.761
I was taken aback,

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:42.600
but, uh, they started singing.

01:09:42.633 --> 01:09:45.301
It was one of the most
beautiful sounds I'd ever heard.

01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:51.408
Afterwards, we started
traveling together.

01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:53.477
We went all over that
whole part of Russia.

01:09:55.378 --> 01:09:57.314
Bob, pretty soon
a terrible thing happened.

01:09:57.815 --> 01:09:59.016
What was that?

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:00.818
I went color blind.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.322
It hit me one evening that...

01:10:06.624 --> 01:10:07.825
I was ruined

01:10:08.659 --> 01:10:09.761
as a Klansman.

01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:16.567
I had to go back and tell
my own daddy that.

01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:18.401
He didn't want anything
to do with the Klan

01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:19.937
and their robes
for the rest of his life.

01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:21.072
He had a robe and all?

01:10:21.105 --> 01:10:23.574
Several, for different
occasions and such, I guess.

01:10:23.608 --> 01:10:26.043
And one day, my mother
cut 'em all up

01:10:26.077 --> 01:10:28.880
and made shirts out of 'em
for me and my brothers.

01:10:28.913 --> 01:10:30.848
Not... not this one.

01:10:30.882 --> 01:10:33.050
Just when I was younger.

01:10:34.051 --> 01:10:36.319
Yeah, this is from a catalog.

01:10:36.353 --> 01:10:38.856
Okay. Well...

01:10:41.592 --> 01:10:43.027
...that'll be enough for now.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.730
Well, should we, uh, pack up,

01:10:45.763 --> 01:10:47.598
clean up, close up shop?

01:10:47.632 --> 01:10:50.500
- What's in the briefcase?
- I don't know. I thought you'd know.

01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:51.803
Oh, really? How would I know?

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.679
- What is all that?
- Well, it's SNCC.

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:03.714
That's the whole organization
right here.

01:11:03.748 --> 01:11:05.683
The whole organization
is in that briefcase?

01:11:05.716 --> 01:11:08.786
- How big is SNCC?
- Counting you?

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.054
Good night!

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:15.593
So, what is it that you think
you can do for SNCC?

01:11:15.626 --> 01:11:21.766
What I was thinking was, somehow I
could be a liaison to college students.

01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:24.702
I know there's still a lot of people
on the fence about the whole issue.

01:11:24.735 --> 01:11:26.804
And maybe I could go around

01:11:26.838 --> 01:11:29.607
college campuses,
talking to students about the Negro cause.

01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:31.642
The what?

01:11:33.077 --> 01:11:34.779
The Negra cause.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.449
Well, for one thing, you better
learn how to pronounce the word.

01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:42.820
- It's Negro.
- Negra.

01:11:43.788 --> 01:11:47.457
- Negro.
- Negra.

01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:49.126
No.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.393
Negro.

01:11:51.896 --> 01:11:53.430
What am I saying?

01:11:53.463 --> 01:11:55.833
What you're saying, "Ne-gruh."

01:11:55.867 --> 01:11:58.736
Okay. I'm gonna
break it down for you.

01:12:00.071 --> 01:12:01.371
What is that?

01:12:02.439 --> 01:12:04.108
My knee.

01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:06.944
Right. How does a child
get bigger?

01:12:07.278 --> 01:12:08.746
They grow.

01:12:08.779 --> 01:12:10.047
Now, put it together.

01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:12.617
Okay. Take your time.

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:15.720
- Knee grow.
- Once again.

01:12:15.753 --> 01:12:17.121
Negro.

01:12:18.521 --> 01:12:20.457
Right. I got it.

01:12:21.458 --> 01:12:24.996
Negro. Negro.

01:12:29.133 --> 01:12:31.035
Negro.

01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:32.169
Negro.

01:12:33.638 --> 01:12:35.773
- What did you say?
- He's okay. He's with me.

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:36.741
He's with you?

01:12:36.774 --> 01:12:39.076
He's trying to learn
how to say something.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:41.012
And "Negro" is the word
he's trying to learn to say?

01:12:41.045 --> 01:12:42.747
So what word was he using?

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.514
We're not looking
for any trouble.

01:12:44.547 --> 01:12:45.750
We were just having some coffee.

01:12:45.783 --> 01:12:48.719
Well, look at that.
Your monkey speaks.

01:12:48.753 --> 01:12:53.057
- Did you just call me a monkey?
- Deepest apologies, to the monkeys.

01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:55.927
Listen. I don't know you.
You don't know me.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.228
Let's just keep it that way.

01:12:57.261 --> 01:12:59.163
The only way to that...

01:12:59.196 --> 01:13:01.632
is if you take this coffee...

01:13:03.167 --> 01:13:04.669
to go.

01:13:04.702 --> 01:13:06.904
Ah! What the hell?

01:13:08.773 --> 01:13:10.107
Bob. Bob! Settle down.

01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:13.177
You better put a leash on your
redneck before it gets hurt, Jim.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.477
Reggie.

01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:15.947
Bob is a volunteer.

01:13:17.214 --> 01:13:18.849
We're recruiting
from the Klan now?

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.152
He's for real, Reggie.

01:13:21.185 --> 01:13:24.487
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

01:13:24.521 --> 01:13:27.591
Well, I was thinking of starting
him on his non-violent training.

01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:28.626
Mm-hmm.

01:13:30.094 --> 01:13:31.562
He could use that.

01:13:33.097 --> 01:13:34.632
But you know what I see...

01:13:36.067 --> 01:13:38.169
when I look
at Mr. Wonderbread here?

01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:41.973
I see FBI.

01:13:44.909 --> 01:13:47.878
Mm. Maybe some local fuzz.

01:13:47.912 --> 01:13:50.081
You think they're trying
to infiltrate us

01:13:50.114 --> 01:13:52.049
by sending us a good old boy?

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:53.784
That's about they speed.

01:13:59.056 --> 01:14:02.026
Look at him, sitting there
just egging us on.

01:14:14.271 --> 01:14:16.574
Monkey see, monkey do.

01:14:16.607 --> 01:14:18.275
You know what monkeys are like?
I know what monkeys are like.

01:14:18.309 --> 01:14:20.144
Oh, yeah.

01:14:29.253 --> 01:14:30.855
- Leon! Leon!
- I can't do this!

01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:32.857
- Cool down. Cool down, baby.
- I can't! No!

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:36.627
- Cool down, baby.
- I can't do this. No.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.162
- Cool down.
- I can't do this.

01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:39.964
Cool down. Sit down.

01:14:41.098 --> 01:14:43.901
There you go.
Sit down. All right?

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:52.076
- I can't do this.
- I know, I can see that.

01:14:52.109 --> 01:14:55.112
But, Leon, if you want
to participate,

01:14:55.146 --> 01:14:57.281
this is what you're
gonna have to learn.

01:14:57.314 --> 01:14:59.050
We ought to be
fighting back.

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:01.619
We ought to be killing
the white sons of bitches!

01:15:01.652 --> 01:15:04.355
Listen, you can't
kill all of 'em.

01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:06.157
And we'll be the ones
that are getting killed.

01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:13.030
And then, we won't be able
to change anything.

01:15:14.965 --> 01:15:17.668
I know it's hard.

01:15:17.701 --> 01:15:20.638
And I know that
you want to strike back,

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.942
but you gotta try
this other thing.

01:15:27.344 --> 01:15:28.746
It can work.

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.815
Gandhi defeated
the British Empire

01:15:32.283 --> 01:15:33.584
and never...

01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:36.287
fired a shot.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.889
I just see red sometimes.

01:15:38.923 --> 01:15:40.191
Me too, brother.

01:15:46.197 --> 01:15:47.731
Me too.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.136
Uh, yeah?

01:15:52.703 --> 01:15:53.838
Come in.

01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:59.376
- <i>Buonanotte.</i>
- What's that?

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.278
"Good night" in Italian.

01:16:01.946 --> 01:16:04.648
<i>Bonne nuit.</i> French.

01:16:04.682 --> 01:16:06.750
<i>Gute Nacht.</i> German.

01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:10.855
<i>Oyasuminasai.</i> Japanese.

01:16:11.122 --> 01:16:12.323
Wow.

01:16:16.794 --> 01:16:18.295
- About today...
- That was pretty rough.

01:16:18.329 --> 01:16:21.132
I guess I should probably go
through that training too, huh?

01:16:21.165 --> 01:16:23.234
I bit a girl's hand
my first time.

01:16:23.267 --> 01:16:25.302
- Dang.
- I did.

01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:29.807
But the real deal is
much worse.

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:31.742
You should know that.

01:16:31.775 --> 01:16:33.711
I know.

01:16:33.744 --> 01:16:35.946
I was in a riot once,
right there with you.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.749
But no one was throwing
punches at your head, Bob.

01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:42.353
When they do, you think
you're gonna throw punches back?

01:16:42.386 --> 01:16:44.388
Well, that's the whole point,
not to, right?

01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:47.691
That is the point.
But can you do that?

01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:52.930
What you drinking?

01:16:52.963 --> 01:16:56.133
Mai Tai cocktail.
You wanna try?

01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:58.836
Shoot. I'll try anything
three times.

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.172
Well,
you might not like it.

01:17:01.772 --> 01:17:03.440
This looks pretty good.

01:17:06.277 --> 01:17:07.945
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

01:17:07.978 --> 01:17:09.313
Oh, shoot.

01:17:09.346 --> 01:17:10.481
Did you really
just do that?

01:17:10.514 --> 01:17:11.982
I'll get it.
I'm in my birthday suit.

01:17:12.016 --> 01:17:14.018
- No, it's fine. I can...
- Oh.

01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:15.719
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:17:23.427 --> 01:17:25.029
Should we be doing this?

01:17:25.462 --> 01:17:26.897
Probably not.

01:17:37.107 --> 01:17:40.844
Oh. It all makes sense now.

01:17:42.479 --> 01:17:44.949
Old Bobby has
just been sniffing around.

01:17:45.516 --> 01:17:46.984
- Slumming
- Reggie.

01:17:47.017 --> 01:17:49.253
Born for this, right,
Wonderbread?

01:17:49.286 --> 01:17:51.822
Because you certainly living
the great Southern tradition.

01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:59.396
So you're telling me you
didn't use the pool, not once?

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:03.801
No. They make you wear
trunks now to swim at the YMCA.

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:05.069
What do you mean?

01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:07.271
Well, up until now,
they wouldn't let you wear anything.

01:18:07.304 --> 01:18:08.872
You mean like butt naked?

01:18:08.906 --> 01:18:11.141
That's the only way
you could swim in the Y.

01:18:11.175 --> 01:18:13.377
Yeah. That's why I didn't swim.
I didn't have a trunk.

01:18:19.516 --> 01:18:22.119
- They killed Herbert Lee.
- What?

01:18:22.152 --> 01:18:23.354
How did it happen?

01:18:23.387 --> 01:18:25.522
His white neighbor killed him.

01:18:25.557 --> 01:18:28.459
State legislator named
E. H. Hurst...

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.929
gunned him down...

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:33.530
in the bright of day.

01:18:33.565 --> 01:18:34.898
I loved that nigger.

01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:40.170
And I hated I had to do
what I had to do.

01:18:40.204 --> 01:18:42.373
He didn't leave me no choice.

01:18:42.406 --> 01:18:45.142
I mean, you can't just stand by
and let 'em run all over you.

01:18:45.175 --> 01:18:48.045
No reason to feel bad
for doing what you had to do.

01:18:51.348 --> 01:18:53.951
You know, I loaned him
the money to buy his place.

01:18:54.551 --> 01:18:56.086
That's the thanks I get?

01:18:56.588 --> 01:18:58.322
Registering to vote.

01:19:01.258 --> 01:19:02.826
Just a damn ingrate.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.461
They didn't even
arrest him, did they?

01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:40.331
Calling everyone to McComb.

01:19:40.364 --> 01:19:41.865
Bob Moses is there.

01:19:43.233 --> 01:19:44.935
So is McDew,

01:19:44.968 --> 01:19:46.904
half a dozen SNCC staffers.

01:19:46.937 --> 01:19:48.906
It'll be the first time
we all in one place...

01:19:50.274 --> 01:19:52.309
to be able to have
that SNCC staff meeting.

01:19:52.343 --> 01:19:54.912
- Bob?
- Yeah. I'm there.

01:19:54.945 --> 01:19:56.280
We're gonna need your car.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.901
Dang it.

01:20:17.935 --> 01:20:19.336
It's so hot under here.

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:21.071
Couldn't we have just got
a sheet or something?

01:20:21.105 --> 01:20:23.374
Leon, you hear
what this cracker just said?

01:20:23.407 --> 01:20:25.610
- Hmm?
- He said he wants a sheet

01:20:25.643 --> 01:20:27.612
instead of them filthy blankets.

01:20:27.645 --> 01:20:31.583
Just like a white cat to feel
more comfortable in a sheet.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:41.358
Oh, come on, Bobby.
That was funny.

01:20:41.392 --> 01:20:43.293
We've got to watch this one.
That's for sure.

01:20:43.327 --> 01:20:45.295
- For sure.
- I got to sit up.

01:20:45.329 --> 01:20:48.198
- Oh, whoa, whoa!
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:48.232 --> 01:20:50.434
We ain't gonna let no
cracker cop see us riding

01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:52.136
with a white boy like you.

01:20:52.169 --> 01:20:55.139
- I'm gonna melt.
- You gotta suffer for the cause, baby.

01:20:55.172 --> 01:20:56.940
You gotta suffer
for the cause.

01:21:36.046 --> 01:21:37.615
Since Herbert Lee's
murder,

01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:40.017
there have been
a number of actions

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:41.653
by high school students
in McComb

01:21:41.686 --> 01:21:44.354
organized by brother
Bob Moses here.

01:21:44.388 --> 01:21:46.490
Three of these students
were arrested

01:21:46.523 --> 01:21:47.692
sitting at a lunch counter

01:21:47.725 --> 01:21:49.493
at the five and dime
on the square.

01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:51.763
They're being released today,

01:21:51.796 --> 01:21:55.466
but I've just been informed that
there will be an assembly held

01:21:55.499 --> 01:21:58.770
at the high school at which the principal
will be addressing the student body

01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:00.605
on these three students.

01:22:00.638 --> 01:22:02.406
Now we're expecting a...

01:22:06.711 --> 01:22:09.112
<i>♪ We've done all you wanted</i>

01:22:09.146 --> 01:22:12.516
<i>♪ We've done all you want, Lord</i>

01:22:12.549 --> 01:22:14.719
<i>♪ We've done
All you wanted... ♪</i>

01:22:17.755 --> 01:22:19.323
Hey. What is it?

01:22:19.356 --> 01:22:21.291
They wouldn't let Brenda Travis
back in.

01:22:21.325 --> 01:22:22.794
They're trying to send her
to a reform school.

01:22:22.827 --> 01:22:24.461
The principal just caved.

01:22:24.495 --> 01:22:26.129
We're going to march
on Magnolia.

01:22:26.163 --> 01:22:27.498
We wanna make some signs.

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:30.400
Okay. Uh, Leon,

01:22:30.434 --> 01:22:31.736
Chuck, give them
some papers.

01:22:34.839 --> 01:22:38.610
<i>When they get up to go,
you just stay back.</i>

01:22:38.643 --> 01:22:41.579
<i>It's crazy marching off
like this without a plan.</i>

01:22:42.647 --> 01:22:45.148
<i>I shouldn't be
involved in this.</i>

01:22:45.182 --> 01:22:47.117
<i>Everybody's gonna get
thrown in jail</i>

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.720
<i>and I can't get arrested.</i>

01:22:49.687 --> 01:22:51.689
<i>I gotta leave tomorrow.</i>

01:22:51.723 --> 01:22:54.258
<i>This is happening too quick.</i>

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:58.195
<i>If I get busted,
what's gonna happen to my mama and daddy?</i>

01:22:58.228 --> 01:23:00.698
<i>Everybody will find out
back home,</i>

01:23:00.732 --> 01:23:03.233
<i>and there'll be hell to pay.</i>

01:23:03.267 --> 01:23:06.804
<i>Daddy will lose his church.
If I'm a part of this,</i>

01:23:06.838 --> 01:23:09.540
<i>it will just cause more
violence down here than normal.</i>

01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:16.213
Really, Bob? What's
a normal level of violence?

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:21.485
You can lay back here
with me if you want.

01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:23.186
You're not going?

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.789
Somebody always
has to stay back.

01:23:24.822 --> 01:23:27.324
So it's been decided.
Reggie and I will hang here.

01:23:28.358 --> 01:23:31.361
Get people out of jail,
that sort of thing?

01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:33.297
I'll hang with the march
for a little bit,

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:34.832
but at some point,
I'll have to turn back.

01:23:38.235 --> 01:23:40.738
This isn't make-believe
anymore, Bob.

01:23:42.406 --> 01:23:45.208
Things are gonna get
real serious out there.

01:23:45.242 --> 01:23:49.714
Nobody here expects you to
step out that door, lover boy.

01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:53.851
Anyway, you already got
what you wanted.

01:23:58.623 --> 01:24:02.125

Son of a bitch.

01:25:01.753 --> 01:25:02.754
Hey, Zellner.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.454
Zellner!

01:25:04.488 --> 01:25:05.957
You low-down son of a bitch,

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:07.925
what the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:25:07.959 --> 01:25:10.561
- Hey, Doc.
- You've really lost your mind, you know that?

01:25:10.595 --> 01:25:11.963
Is this where you're from?

01:25:11.996 --> 01:25:13.865
You're in way over your head
on this one.

01:25:13.898 --> 01:25:16.466
You know what they're gonna
write on your tombstone?

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.434
"Traitor."

01:25:17.467 --> 01:25:19.704
Yeah, I'm gonna piss on it
to seal the deal.

01:25:20.537 --> 01:25:23.407
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, that was Doc.

01:25:24.341 --> 01:25:25.677
I guess he's from McComb.

01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.345
You're not just passing?
You're really white, aren't you?

01:25:28.378 --> 01:25:29.379
Yeah.

01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:32.349

Bob, keep your head down.

01:27:06.577 --> 01:27:07.612
They're gonna kill him.

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:15.318
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

01:27:49.386 --> 01:27:50.688
I want to make a phone call.

01:27:51.421 --> 01:27:52.522
You want what?

01:27:53.456 --> 01:27:54.926
Every prisoner has a right
to a phone call

01:27:54.959 --> 01:27:56.928
and I want to make mine
right now.

01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:58.796
But you're not under arrest.

01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:00.631
- Then arrest me.
- For what?

01:28:01.732 --> 01:28:03.601
What did you get
everybody else for?

01:28:03.634 --> 01:28:05.770
- Breaching the peace.
- Okay, then.

01:28:05.803 --> 01:28:07.370
Well, I can't do that.

01:28:07.404 --> 01:28:11.441
- Why not?
- Because you didn't breach the peace.

01:28:11.474 --> 01:28:13.878
I had a right to be down there
but everybody else didn't?

01:28:13.911 --> 01:28:15.680
Well, put him
at the head of the class.

01:28:17.148 --> 01:28:18.649
What if I slug
this fellow right here?

01:28:18.683 --> 01:28:19.516
Is that enough
to get me arrested?

01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:21.619
Jay-Jay, get him
the hell out of here.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.562
Jay-Jay,
why don't you slow up?

01:28:31.596 --> 01:28:33.798
Uh, I don't think
ain't nobody chasing us.

01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:36.100
Yeah, Jay-Jay,
why don't you slow up?

01:28:36.133 --> 01:28:37.768
You ain't in any real hurry,
are you?

01:28:37.802 --> 01:28:39.704
Hey, why don't you shut up?

01:28:39.737 --> 01:28:41.706
You New York
Jew bastard communist.

01:28:41.739 --> 01:28:43.007
You really a communist?

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:47.444
Well, Jay-Jay says so.

01:28:47.477 --> 01:28:49.981
I ain't never heard nobody
speak no communist.

01:28:50.014 --> 01:28:51.682
Can you say something
communist for me?

01:28:51.716 --> 01:28:53.516
Younger, shut up.

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:56.553
But I ain't never heard nobody
speak no communist before.

01:28:56.587 --> 01:28:58.656
You ain't got the sense
God gave a billy goat.

01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:01.125
He always talk to you like that?

01:29:02.126 --> 01:29:04.028
Yeah, pretty much.

01:29:04.061 --> 01:29:06.197
Younger, I told you
to button it.

01:29:06.230 --> 01:29:09.867
And stop talking to that goddamn
New York Jew commie bastard.

01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:12.703
What do you know about New York, Jay-Jay?
You ever been up there?

01:29:12.737 --> 01:29:16.539
No. And I don't
plan to go neither.

01:29:16.574 --> 01:29:19.877
But I guess we'll be sending your
remains back up there to somebody.

01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:23.681
My remains will be sent back to
Alabama since that's where I'm from.

01:29:24.582 --> 01:29:26.651
- You're lying.
- No.

01:29:26.684 --> 01:29:28.119
Daddy's a Methodist minister

01:29:28.152 --> 01:29:30.553
and I'm from East Brewton,
Alabama.

01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:42.700
You're telling me
you're from Alabama?

01:29:42.733 --> 01:29:44.501
We got cousins over
in Dothan.

01:29:44.534 --> 01:29:46.503
That ain't far from Brewton.
Maybe you know 'em.

01:29:46.536 --> 01:29:48.039
- Ethel...
- Younger!

01:29:49.073 --> 01:29:51.108
We're not making friends here.

01:29:52.576 --> 01:29:54.078
Your daddy's a minister.

01:29:55.512 --> 01:29:57.581
Where did he go
to seminary school?

01:29:57.615 --> 01:29:59.951
Bob Jones College.
You ever heard of it?

01:29:59.984 --> 01:30:01.986
I heard of Bob Jones.

01:30:02.019 --> 01:30:05.756
- He's got a school?
- Yeah, it's who I'm named after.

01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:08.159
I'm telling, y'all.
I'm from Alabama.

01:30:08.192 --> 01:30:09.694
He sure sound like it.

01:30:13.831 --> 01:30:15.800
Does your mother know
that you're doing this?

01:30:16.533 --> 01:30:17.534
She knows.

01:30:18.936 --> 01:30:20.771
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:30:22.773 --> 01:30:24.675
A minister's boy too...

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:27.011
named after Bob Jones
and everything.

01:30:27.044 --> 01:30:28.545
Get him back in the car.

01:31:03.748 --> 01:31:06.017
There he is. Come on, Younger.

01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:09.186
- Where you going?
- I'm out.

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.656
- You... What's going on here?
- This boy's from Alabama.

01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:14.792
Well, no shit.

01:31:14.825 --> 01:31:16.060
You already knew that?

01:31:16.093 --> 01:31:18.729
You gotta draw the line
somewhere, Jay-Jay.

01:31:18.763 --> 01:31:20.865
And this boy here
is way over it.

01:31:22.066 --> 01:31:24.001
Hey, Doc.

01:31:24.035 --> 01:31:26.904
Back in town, how come you didn't
have the guts to step forward?

01:31:26.937 --> 01:31:28.039
Why don't you shut up, Bob?

01:31:28.072 --> 01:31:30.041
Bob? You know him?

01:31:30.074 --> 01:31:33.010
Oh, yeah. We went to school together.
Go ahead.

01:31:33.044 --> 01:31:35.079
I'm warning you, boy.
Tie him up.

01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:40.251
We about to hang a buddy of yours.
That don't seem right.

01:31:40.284 --> 01:31:42.920
We are in crap
right up to our necks.

01:31:42.953 --> 01:31:45.089
I'm out
and I'm taking Younger with me.

01:31:45.122 --> 01:31:46.791
There ain't no reason to be out.

01:31:46.824 --> 01:31:48.359
Everybody has seen us take him.

01:31:48.392 --> 01:31:49.593
That don't matter.

01:31:50.728 --> 01:31:51.829
You sure about that?

01:31:51.862 --> 01:31:55.199
Did you know who everybody was downtown?
I didn't.

01:31:55.232 --> 01:31:57.001
There was what looked like
feds down there.

01:31:57.034 --> 01:31:59.203
Well, murder is a state charge.

01:31:59.236 --> 01:32:02.239
And you never saw the feds do anything
to anybody else any other time.

01:32:02.273 --> 01:32:04.175
This ain't like any other time!

01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:06.310
When they give you
all the chair for killing me,

01:32:06.343 --> 01:32:09.013
<i>I guess it'll be justice
for everybody else you killed.</i>

01:32:10.147 --> 01:32:11.816
Nobody is getting the chair.

01:32:11.849 --> 01:32:14.652
He's from Alabama.
You went to school with him.

01:32:14.685 --> 01:32:16.087
They're gonna give us
the chair for sure.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.388
You knew
his daddy's a minister?

01:32:17.421 --> 01:32:20.324
It... Nothing
is gonna happen to us.

01:32:20.357 --> 01:32:23.027
Nothing's gonna happen to me
'cause I'm gone.

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.296
You do what you want.
Let's go.

01:32:25.329 --> 01:32:28.232
Feds will still get you for
aiding and abetting, Jay-Jay.

01:32:43.948 --> 01:32:45.149
Okay!

01:32:48.853 --> 01:32:51.755
What the hell?
I didn't give no goddamn signal!

01:32:51.789 --> 01:32:52.890
Cut the rope!

01:32:52.923 --> 01:32:54.625
Cut the goddamn rope.

01:33:30.928 --> 01:33:33.063
Holy Jesus and Mary.

01:33:33.097 --> 01:33:36.901
There was a civil rights march in
McComb, Mississippi yesterday.

01:33:36.934 --> 01:33:39.770
Oh... How many people were hurt?

01:33:39.803 --> 01:33:42.173
And guess who they say led it?

01:33:42.206 --> 01:33:45.142
Twenty-two-year-old
Robert Zellner.

01:33:45.176 --> 01:33:47.711
- That can't be right.
- We better call somebody.

01:33:49.413 --> 01:33:52.349
Operator. I want to make
a call to Alabama.

01:33:52.383 --> 01:33:54.385
Hey, there,
Mr. Civil Rights leader.

01:33:54.418 --> 01:33:56.153
- Good morning.
- How's your neck?

01:33:56.187 --> 01:34:00.357
Oh. My neck already had
a tinge of red to it.

01:34:00.391 --> 01:34:02.092
Well...

01:34:02.126 --> 01:34:04.061
according to the New York paper,

01:34:04.094 --> 01:34:08.465
you, Mr. Robert Zellner,
led the first civil rights march

01:34:08.499 --> 01:34:10.401
in the great state
of Mississippi.

01:34:10.434 --> 01:34:12.002
It's the great state of Alabama.

01:34:12.036 --> 01:34:13.070
What did you say?

01:34:14.972 --> 01:34:17.775
Why would they write that?
That's a lie.

01:34:17.808 --> 01:34:20.077
They looked out
and saw a hundred Black folk

01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:21.779
and thought
they couldn't possibly

01:34:21.812 --> 01:34:24.782
have the guts
or brains to pull that off.

01:34:24.815 --> 01:34:28.152
And then they saw you and thought,
"Oh, it all makes sense now."

01:34:28.185 --> 01:34:30.354
Man, I didn't mean to.

01:34:30.387 --> 01:34:32.356
No, well, you're famous now.

01:34:32.389 --> 01:34:34.458
But, as my mother always says,

01:34:34.491 --> 01:34:37.895
"Don't believe anything you
read, only half of what you see."

01:34:37.928 --> 01:34:39.930
Yeah, right.

01:34:39.964 --> 01:34:41.832
You still plan on
skipping town today?

01:34:41.865 --> 01:34:43.934
Reggie told me
you have a bus to catch.

01:34:43.968 --> 01:34:46.337
- A bus?
- Your friend from the bridge came by

01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:48.205
and burned your car.

01:34:49.006 --> 01:34:50.107
He did what?

01:34:51.809 --> 01:34:53.310
So, you think about

01:34:53.344 --> 01:34:56.247
coming down to visit for
Thanksgiving or Christmas break?

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.848
I have been considering it.

01:34:58.482 --> 01:34:59.483
Okay.

01:35:00.384 --> 01:35:02.319
Well, write me.

01:35:02.353 --> 01:35:05.422
You know, you could think about
coming up for a visit as well.

01:35:05.456 --> 01:35:08.826
- I could think about that.
- Don't think too long.

01:35:08.859 --> 01:35:11.528
And it won't hurt to take
a language while you're up.

01:35:26.076 --> 01:35:29.280
Somebody said they saw you
coming out here.

01:35:29.313 --> 01:35:32.516
I see you still enjoy the
company of mongrels over men.

01:35:32.549 --> 01:35:36.020
Let it go, Bob.
Your bus will be here in a minute.

01:35:36.053 --> 01:35:39.223
What the Black bitch says
is true.

01:35:39.256 --> 01:35:43.160
Nothing down here is any of
your business any which way.

01:35:43.193 --> 01:35:46.163
I just came by to remind you that
if you do decide to come back,

01:35:46.196 --> 01:35:47.331
I got something waiting...

01:35:55.139 --> 01:35:57.808
- Bob...
- Don't you say another damn thing.

01:36:02.346 --> 01:36:05.449
Hey! I just bought that.

01:36:05.482 --> 01:36:08.452
Don't get in between white folks
arguing, you hear me?

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.623
Ain't you supposed to be
non-violent now?

01:36:11.656 --> 01:36:13.957
I'm having a real big problem
with that right now

01:36:13.991 --> 01:36:16.093
'cause what I want to do is
pull you clean out of this truck

01:36:16.126 --> 01:36:17.528
and beat you
like there's no tomorrow.

01:36:17.562 --> 01:36:18.763
I want to knock you
into next week.

01:36:18.797 --> 01:36:22.032
I want the next face you see
to be the emergency room doctor.

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:27.204
But I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

01:36:27.237 --> 01:36:29.506
You're a monster, Doc.
You deserve no pity shown to you.

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:32.443
But you know something else?

01:36:32.476 --> 01:36:35.346
I'm a goddamn monster too and
I don't want to be one anymore.

01:36:35.379 --> 01:36:37.582
I don't want to be like
every sucker I grew up with.

01:36:41.218 --> 01:36:42.386
See that woman over there?

01:36:45.255 --> 01:36:47.458
She's trying to teach me
what it means to be a man.

01:36:47.491 --> 01:36:50.227
She says I should not beat you
till your mama won't know ya.

01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:54.998
She says an eye for an eye
leaves everybody blind.

01:36:55.032 --> 01:36:58.168
Well, I want to be
more like her.

01:36:58.202 --> 01:37:01.138
I don't want to be the horror
in some little child's eyes.

01:37:20.324 --> 01:37:22.594
Now, you drive off.

01:37:22.627 --> 01:37:25.963
Don't you turn around,
don't you come back here with anybody

01:37:25.996 --> 01:37:27.665
'cause if I ever see you again,

01:37:29.466 --> 01:37:33.003
I'm gonna forgive myself
and I don't wanna do that.

01:37:33.036 --> 01:37:36.540
And not just 'cause she wouldn't
like it but that would be enough.

01:37:36.574 --> 01:37:38.208
Can we agree on that?

01:37:58.162 --> 01:37:59.597
You missed your bus.

01:38:01.331 --> 01:38:03.133
Ah, no, that wasn't my bus.

01:38:03.668 --> 01:38:05.202
My nigger.

01:38:05.637 --> 01:38:06.638
What?

01:38:11.408 --> 01:38:13.678
My nigger! Yeah!
Look at you go!

01:38:13.711 --> 01:38:16.213
I saw you. Oh, you were
gonna get him, yeah!

01:38:16.246 --> 01:38:18.650
- Is that supposed to be a compliment?
- Mm-hmm. Little bit.

01:38:20.551 --> 01:38:23.520
What are we, uh...
What are we supposed to do now?

01:38:23.554 --> 01:38:25.322
We're gonna check on
McDew and the others

01:38:25.355 --> 01:38:27.257
and see how they're doing
in county jail.

01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:30.127
All right. Well, I guess
I better go too, then.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:34.498
Oh! So you're gonna give this
whole civil rights thing a try?

01:38:34.531 --> 01:38:37.067
Oh, you know me,
I'll try anything three times.

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.737
- Easy white boy, let's go.
- All right. Come on.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.659
We think that
in order to facilitate change,

01:39:34.692 --> 01:39:37.394
and in order
to create the type of society

01:39:37.427 --> 01:39:40.330
that we think
that we all basically want,

01:39:40.364 --> 01:39:44.301
that we have to take this sort of
peaceful, non-violent direct action.

01:39:44.334 --> 01:39:47.705
How long will this group remain
outside this locked door, Mr. Zellner?

01:39:47.739 --> 01:39:52.376
We'll stand here until we're able
to reach some sort of agreement

01:39:52.409 --> 01:39:54.311
to open the restaurant.

01:39:54.344 --> 01:39:57.214
Attempt to stand here
as long as we're able.

01:39:57.247 --> 01:39:59.584
Do you feel that
your position is reasonable?

01:39:59.617 --> 01:40:03.287
I think so. And I think that
it's the only way to do it.

01:40:22.774 --> 01:40:24.842
<i>My philosophy is very simple.</i>

01:40:24.876 --> 01:40:27.544
<i>When you see something
that is not right,</i>

01:40:27.579 --> 01:40:30.113
<i>not fair, not just,</i>

01:40:30.147 --> 01:40:33.317
<i>you have a moral obligation to
say something, to do something,</i>

01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:35.853
<i>stand up, speak up, speak out.</i>

01:42:47.864 --> 01:42:52.864
