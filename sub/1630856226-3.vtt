WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.096
I carry my rosary.
That's why I'm protected.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.445
What do y'all
want me to do?

00:10.445 --> 00:12.142
Get mad at him and scream
and throw a shoe at him?

00:12.142 --> 00:14.101
"Oh, my God, I can't believe
you went to the nail salon

00:14.101 --> 00:15.232
"with Breanna."

00:15.232 --> 00:16.886
That's a Juan moment.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.931
Hold on. They've already
stole my joy.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.064
I don't give a .

00:21.064 --> 00:22.326
So, do you think that
Michael is gonna

00:22.326 --> 00:25.068
move forward
with his lawsuit?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.940
Um, yes, he is.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.465
I think it really did
affect his business.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.336
Obviously, Candiace and I
don't have a relationship.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.121
How do you all feel
about Candiace?

00:34.121 --> 00:35.861
I don't know who y'all
are talking about, right now.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.950
Is she coming to your
housewarming party tomorrow?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.083
I haven't invited her.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.737
I'm inviting
my friend, Nneka.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.826
She is a lawyer.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.523
She moved here to be
with her husband.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.308
20854, baby!

00:47.308 --> 00:50.572
I just recently closed on
a beautiful home in Potomac.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.095
And we're gonna keep
this chandelier, right?

00:52.095 --> 00:53.705
No, we're not keeping
that chandelier.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.142
That's going
in the garbage.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.231
I'm really excited
to have the girls at my house,

00:57.231 --> 00:59.711
and I can start
this new chapter

00:59.711 --> 01:01.278
with them by my side.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.975
You guys actually have
a lot in common.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.760
She's Igbo, as well.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.718
- I am.
- Her name is Nneka. Yeah.
- All right.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.678
Only because I talked about it
with Nneka,

01:09.678 --> 01:11.245
there was this article
about you or something

01:11.245 --> 01:13.334
being, like,
Osu or something,

01:13.334 --> 01:15.249
and she basically was like,

01:15.249 --> 01:18.643
"Oh, Osu is, like,
terrible."

01:27.087 --> 01:30.133
Osu is something from,
like, ancient Gods

01:30.133 --> 01:31.874
in Nigeria.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.049
My family is not that, right?

01:33.049 --> 01:34.572
Okay.

01:34.572 --> 01:37.836
And it basically is people
who are considered outcasts.

01:37.836 --> 01:42.885
So, yes, it is a bad thing,
but that's just a bad article.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.408
It ain't me.
- Okay, good.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.367
So, Robyn,
I care about you,

01:46.367 --> 01:48.282
and I really, really
wanna support you

01:48.282 --> 01:50.022
as a friend
during this time.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.285
I know it's very hard.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.025
No, listen,
this is the thing about me.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.332
I'm not running
from anything.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.204
I'm not like, "Oh, my God,
don't talk about me.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.901
I can't believe you-
you talked about that."

01:58.901 --> 02:00.468
I'm not doing
none of that.

02:00.468 --> 02:03.384
I wish Ashley was here,
but Gizelle, Ashley,

02:03.384 --> 02:06.256
and Charrisse, we had
a nice little get-together,

02:06.256 --> 02:08.911
and I was thinking about

02:08.911 --> 02:10.521
some of the things
that were said.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.262
You know, Gizelle,
you were very adamant

02:12.262 --> 02:17.398
on Juan can't be around
his co-worker slash friend

02:17.398 --> 02:18.399
because of the optics.
- I didn't--

02:18.399 --> 02:19.748
No, no, no,
let me just talk.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.097
- In public, in-in-in-
- In public, all of that.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.664
- Yes.
- Right,

02:22.664 --> 02:25.275
and-and I am not gonna ask him
to do anything differently

02:25.275 --> 02:28.191
that he would not
normally do

02:28.191 --> 02:30.933
outside of my knowledge,
for optics.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.152
- Did I say that?
- You said that?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.241
He can't be seen with her?
- No, I said,

02:34.241 --> 02:35.459
what I-- what we--
- She-- no, no, no.

02:35.459 --> 02:39.115
She wanted me almost
to be upset with him

02:39.115 --> 02:41.596
because I'm being
dragged into this situation

02:41.596 --> 02:43.641
where the public
is just speculating.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.252
- Okay, okay, okay.
- And what I'm saying is,

02:45.252 --> 02:46.992
I don't care
that the block is hot.

02:46.992 --> 02:50.170
I feel like the two of them
are like Beavis and Butthead.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.216
So, it's, like,
really refreshing

02:53.216 --> 02:57.002
to see Gizelle be real
with her friend.

02:57.002 --> 03:00.876
I feel sorry for the people
who waste their precious time

03:00.876 --> 03:02.312
worrying about
my boring life.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.488
Mm-hmm. Okay. All right.
Thank you for the update.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.273
Have we handled
all of that?

03:06.273 --> 03:09.624
Because I said to Karen
that she owes you an apology.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.713
- Yeah, and I--
- And I then said to Gizelle

03:11.713 --> 03:13.193
you owe me an apology.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.412
So, I-I don't you can
move forward without talking,

03:15.412 --> 03:17.240
if you are open to it.
- I'm open to it.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.241
Let's go have a moment.
Come on.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.547
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.770
So, did you guys see
the house? How is it?

03:25.770 --> 03:27.294
- Yeah, it's-it's beautiful.
- It's gorgeous.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.382
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, it's really pretty.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.470
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of Ashley.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.298
It's very, like,
it's very, uh--

03:31.298 --> 03:32.690
- Country chic.
- Yes.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.518
- No, she said-- she said--
- No, not country.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.129
It's beachy.
Where you been?

03:37.129 --> 03:39.349
I've been talking
to the doctor.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.656
We had a really good
conversation, Wendy and I.

03:41.656 --> 03:42.874
Oh, good.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.748
- Have a seat, Miss Robyn.
- All right.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.664
We're gonna sit
by each other? Okay.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.187
All right, look, first of all--
- I mean, I don't want you

03:51.187 --> 03:52.841
to get your breath
on the food.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.583
Yeah. Oh, well,
you and I

03:55.583 --> 03:57.324
have been not
the closest of friends

03:57.324 --> 03:59.064
in this circle for years.
- Yeah.

03:59.064 --> 04:02.329
But last year,
it went extremely left.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.678
One day,
people are going to see you

04:03.678 --> 04:05.549
for who you are.
- People see me, right now,

04:05.549 --> 04:07.334
and they clearly are--
- Yeah, a bullsh---er.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.683
I know that you know
about the rumors

04:08.683 --> 04:10.162
about the blonde girl
in Georgetown.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.947
I know you know that
because you're smart.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.035
All of us know
about it, right?

04:13.035 --> 04:14.645
I've never heard of it
in my life.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.126
But what you should
care about, Karen,

04:17.126 --> 04:20.042
is people sending us
actual pictures

04:20.042 --> 04:22.044
of you
with a blue-eyed man

04:22.044 --> 04:25.569
in Redskins gear
in Vegas at a bar.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.788
Okay.
- What I care about,

04:26.788 --> 04:28.877
is how Robyn Dixon
and Karen Huger

04:28.877 --> 04:30.139
decide to move on.

04:30.139 --> 04:33.055
To set boundaries,
I think that, for me,

04:33.055 --> 04:34.404
I won't repeat rumors
about you.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.537
I will only repeat
facts about you.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.539
I want you to do
the same thing.
- Same thing.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.803
Wendy, Karen told us that
you may be doing a new show.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.718
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.546
So, you guys know I've been
in the political commentator

04:45.546 --> 04:47.417
space for a long time.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.811
And I came to a point,
especially during the pandemic,

04:49.811 --> 04:51.856
where I felt like
news sometimes shies away

04:51.856 --> 04:55.120
from topics that they think
are too controversial.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.604
Well, everything
ain't for everybody.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.389
Everything ain't
for everybody.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.173
My demographic
is a little bit different,

05:04.173 --> 05:06.393
the educational demographic
of my show.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.743
That's-- it's probably
gonna go over my head.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.440
My show vibrates
really high.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.529
So, if people are not
at the intellectual level

05:12.529 --> 05:13.661
to receive it,
then I understand

05:13.661 --> 05:15.489
why it may not be for them.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.273
That's a little shady.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.275
Was it?
I was just drinking my water.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.755
You know, she already
made it very clear

05:20.755 --> 05:22.844
that she said she doesn't
wanna with me. So...

05:22.844 --> 05:24.846
If somebody threw a drink
on you, would you?

05:24.846 --> 05:26.978
I'm not in town for business.
- Wendy...

05:26.978 --> 05:28.371
- Oh!
- Oh!

05:29.720 --> 05:31.592
Now, I need
to know somethin'.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.769
Your marriage, is it open,
or is it traditional?

05:34.769 --> 05:36.292
- We have
a traditional marriage.
- Okay.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.772
We do not have
an open marriage.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.513
- And you're married legally.
- Yes.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.776
All right.
That's all I need to know.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.604
Can I expect the same
from you, though,

05:43.604 --> 05:45.606
as far as how we deal
with each other?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.825
I-I mean,
you started it.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.349
That's all I can say.
- No, I did not start it.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.002
- You did.
- No, you started it.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.743
- No.
- We'll never agree.
You started it.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.832
People saw you were
the liar, not me.
- You started it.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.747
- Let's go. You did it.
You did it. You did it.
- They-they see you. Trust.

05:56.747 --> 06:00.664
Listen, the-the-the moral
to this story is,

06:00.664 --> 06:03.841
don't talk about me,
and I won't talk about you.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.408
The end.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.540
I'm not trying to play
the lawyer card,

06:06.540 --> 06:08.150
but let's get some order
going on here.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.326
I think that,
first of all,

06:10.326 --> 06:11.806
it's not just about
throwing a drink,

06:11.806 --> 06:13.329
but after we wrapped
in New York

06:13.329 --> 06:15.592
and everyone
said their piece,

06:15.592 --> 06:17.420
you then go on social media

06:17.420 --> 06:19.901
and then proceed
to attack me.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.686
So, let's not throw rocks
and hide our hands here.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.514
But, throw-- and you can't
talk about women's empowerment

06:24.514 --> 06:26.777
when the moment you get
a chance to beat someone down,

06:26.777 --> 06:28.997
you beat them down.
Why not uplift me, Wendy?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.390
Because you're slow.
I can't uplift you.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.132
You're too low down.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.438
It's too slow for me.
- Then if you vibrate so high,

06:35.438 --> 06:37.353
why are you so quick
to call somebody so slow?

06:37.353 --> 06:39.573
Oh, oh,
because you're slow.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.488
She, like, in her mind,
thinks that she's going high,

06:41.488 --> 06:43.315
but she's really going
- ing low, okay?

06:43.315 --> 06:45.840
Wendy comes at people

06:45.840 --> 06:50.671
with these nasty phrases
because it's her way

06:50.671 --> 06:54.370
of making herself
feel better about herself.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.981
I am such
in a good place.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.158
Love your energy.
Love yours. Love yours.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.464
Excited about my show.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.423
Let's elevate
the conversation.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.815
Okay, are we staying
outside in the rain?

07:04.815 --> 07:07.078
No, we'll just grab
a beverage and go inside.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.558
All right.
I'm going inside.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.608
- Oh, was this hers?
- No, no, no, take it, girl.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.174
I never want anyone
to be thirsty.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.699
I-I wouldn't do
that to somebody.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.135
How are you feeling, though,

07:20.135 --> 07:22.485
all these people telling you
to don't live your life?

07:22.485 --> 07:23.573
Hide out.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.445
- I'm a very tough person.
- Mm-hmm.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.098
And so, I'm fine.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.883
I mean, there's definitely
moments where it was, like,

07:28.883 --> 07:30.537
good Lord--
It's just like a pile on.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.495
It's like the-the crazy life
that we live

07:32.495 --> 07:34.715
where people are just,
you know--

07:34.715 --> 07:37.761
I mean, you go online,
it's new news about somebody.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.154
Hi.
I love this pink.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.721
Hi. Thank you.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.592
You know, every wants
gossip, gossip, gossip,

07:42.592 --> 07:43.854
gossip. And so, for...
- Right.

07:43.854 --> 07:44.899
But, I mean, you guys have
your situation,

07:44.899 --> 07:46.030
and you know
what you're doing.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.510
So, that's all that matters.
- Yeah.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.642
What's this?

07:48.642 --> 07:49.773
No, I had, uh,
suntan lotion,

07:49.773 --> 07:52.602
and I don't want to--
- Okay, okay.

07:52.602 --> 07:53.647
In case, you know.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.735
So, where are y'all living?

07:54.735 --> 07:56.084
We live in Clarksville,
right now,

07:56.084 --> 07:57.868
but we just bought a Potomac.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.087
So, we're moving
in, like, two weeks.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.350
I'm close.
So, I live in Howard County.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.700
Oh, I'll give you a call.
We'll go grab-grab a cockie.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.572
- Yeah, a cockie.
- Grab a cockie. Yeah.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.574
- Thank you for coming.
- Yes, I love it.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.532
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.751
- Oh, he's leaving?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.013
Bye-bye.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.583
Ashley, I'm having
a first communion for my boys.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.975
I told Karen about it.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.456
Next Saturday,
I will want you to be there.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.892
Oh, that would be
really nice.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.986
I mean, hello.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.771
The-these are my babies.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.556
I do not want them
to be around anyone

08:33.556 --> 08:36.777
who has ill will
towards their mother.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.648
I hope she doesn't think
that this is some sort

08:38.648 --> 08:40.520
of revenge for last year.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.043
My kids wanna do,
like, a family fun day.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.697
So, we're on spring break.
- Is she not invited?

08:43.697 --> 08:45.786
- Nuh-uh.
- Oh.
- That's fine.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.135
You actually did us a favor,

08:47.135 --> 08:49.746
if you are trying to prove
some type of point.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.487
All right, babes.
Well, thank you.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.880
Thank you for coming.
Appreciate it.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.359
Thank you for having us
in your beautiful home.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.057
Thank you.
It's been great.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.233
You don't have to go home,
but you gotta get outta here.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.887
Yes.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.018
Coming up...

09:01.018 --> 09:02.846
Should we be
going to par-tays?

09:02.846 --> 09:05.632
Mom, you went
to the parties.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.676
- I did.
- Yeah.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.635
I was the party.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.333
Can you tell me anything
about this damn lawsuit

09:11.333 --> 09:12.987
that Michael has started?

09:29.917 --> 09:33.224
I'm doing a nine city tour.
Like, that's insane.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.052
The Deep Space tour.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.576
Period.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.144
- One, two, three.
- Deep Space!

09:42.886 --> 09:44.018
Wow.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.846
Look how big
these birds are, bro.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.239
They can smell
this dead snake.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.719
No, they see it.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.634
Like, you wouldn't
even know that was a snake.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.984
Oh, my God.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.203
Yo!

09:57.684 --> 09:59.686
Yo, that's crazy.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.427
That thing is,
like, all bones.

10:02.427 --> 10:03.733
I didn't know
a snake had bones.

10:03.733 --> 10:04.865
That is wild.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.431
Stop playing with me.
- I was walking.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.790
- How do I do this?
- Okay.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.270
Just hold onto it.
I'll take it.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.576
Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

10:20.576 --> 10:21.925
- Hi.
- Good.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.318
Like, you don't really
need a lot of sweatshirts.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.754
I need, like, shorts.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.496
- You need shorts.
- Or, like, tank tops.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.932
Tank tops?

10:28.932 --> 10:31.761
We need to look
semi-professional.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.373
Well, for
the party-party time.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.158
- For party time?
- Yes.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.857
Listen, I have
been preparing Grace

10:40.857 --> 10:43.991
to be on her own from
the moment she was born,

10:43.991 --> 10:45.688
and she is about to
graduate from high school

10:45.688 --> 10:47.777
and go to college, baby.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.561
So proud of her,
so happy for her,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.433
but, yes, it is sad.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.043
Should we be going
to the par-tays?

10:53.043 --> 10:56.133
Mom, you went
to the parties.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.047
- I did.
- Yeah.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.658
- I was the party.
- Yeah.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.703
However, it's
a different time.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.618
My love for her
is way more important

11:02.618 --> 11:04.576
than my tears. So...

11:04.576 --> 11:05.969
You can cry.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.189
So, are we good for prom
'cause they have, like,

11:08.189 --> 11:09.973
some sparkly dresses?
- Mom, stop playing.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.583
- No?
- That's a joke.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.022
I have my prom dress.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.677
- And you're dateless?
- Yes.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.504
I like that.
I like that, just free.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.158
Right, no babysitting today.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.420
I do like that.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.813
No babysitting
these little boys out here.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.162
No, thank you.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.512
They don't know how
to mingle in the crowd,

11:27.512 --> 11:29.645
like, ugh.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.994
No, thanks.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.169
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.649
What?

11:33.649 --> 11:34.911
'Cause I-I don't
wanna poo-poo on

11:34.911 --> 11:36.870
all 17-year-old boys.
- No, it's true.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.481
No, they-they deserve it.
- Okay.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.526
What happens on the dance floor
when you're dateless?

11:41.526 --> 11:43.093
You just do it
be yourself?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.269
You just do a little--
- I don't-I don't do

11:45.269 --> 11:46.401
whatever dance that is.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.837
What's the hot dances
these days?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.012
Not what you do.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.579
Let me see
what y'all got.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.363
When-when did
we start gyrating?

11:54.104 --> 11:57.151
Boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.023
Hee-haw, hee-gaw.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.199
- Your dad will be coming.
- I know.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.201
Is he gonna be freaking out
when he sees you

12:04.201 --> 12:06.464
in your dress because
your dress is scan-tal?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.250
It's not bad.
It just has, like,

12:09.250 --> 12:11.731
a little one, two, three,
maybe four.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.949
You have four cutouts
on the sides.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.560
It's only,
like, it's small.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.927
Kam, I think it's yours.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.580
- I don't want the tail.
- Okay.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.278
Kamrynn, did you nap
at school today?

12:37.278 --> 12:39.106
- No.
- Oh.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.672
No wonder.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.849
You're-you're acting like
someone who did not take a nap.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.372
That's okay.
- Yeah.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
Are you guys excited
for your first communion?

12:49.507 --> 12:51.074
No, you're not.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.424
This is-- I sent them
my first communion picture

12:53.424 --> 12:54.991
when I was seven years old

12:54.991 --> 12:56.819
to inspire them to be
better for the day.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.778
Okay, let me see it.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.172
She looks good.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.739
- She looks beautiful.
- Thank you, baby.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.915
I am Catholic.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.830
I even went to
Catholic school,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.266
and I used to get detention

13:09.266 --> 13:10.920
because I will
roll my skirt up,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.488
and then the nuns will tell me
my skirt was too short.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.099
So, I am a Catholic girl
through and through.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.449
The Sunday School people
gave to us

13:18.449 --> 13:19.581
to practice with you guys.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.322
You take the bread,
and then you have

13:21.322 --> 13:23.933
the blood of Jesus,
which is the wine.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.979
Both of those things
are the Eucharist.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.894
What am I supposed
to wear?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
The guests are supposed
to wear yellow

13:29.373 --> 13:32.289
because, in the Bible, yellow
was a prominent color.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.335
Oh, that's what--
oh, that's what it is?

13:34.335 --> 13:35.510
That's what we're
supposed to wear,

13:35.510 --> 13:37.555
but I'm wearing white.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.036
You're-- but you're not
getting communion, though.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.385
Why are you wearing white?

13:41.385 --> 13:42.691
Are my kids-- are my kids
getting communion?

13:42.691 --> 13:43.953
Yeah.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.215
- I need to wear white.
- It's our event.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.695
Yeah, but just like
your wedding

13:46.695 --> 13:48.088
when your wife wears
her white dress,

13:48.088 --> 13:49.829
mommy is gonna wear
a white dress, too.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.004
You don't wear
a white dress

13:51.004 --> 13:52.832
if we're not marrying you.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.050
What-what are we talk--

13:54.050 --> 13:55.008
what are we talking about?
- You're my son.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.052
You're forever married
to me.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.794
Your wife just
doesn't know that yet.

13:58.794 --> 13:59.882
I don't have a wife.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.800
Let's go upstairs.
We have to try on clothes.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.846
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.632
I'm actually
the daughter of a preacher,

14:10.632 --> 14:11.851
but he's not Catholic.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.200
My mom was born Catholic.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.202
My dad, I think, is,
like, Protestant.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.986
My parents got divorced
because my dad

14:16.986 --> 14:19.554
was so deep
into his religion

14:19.554 --> 14:21.512
that she divorced him.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.298
So, we are in the church
of Happy Eddie.

14:24.298 --> 14:27.562
Now, Karter and Kruz,
you're gonna come.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.869
Priest Happy Eddie,
can you give a sermon?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.306
- Dearly beloved--
- Yes, sir.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.874
We are here to receive
a little happiness in your life.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.180
Happiness.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.531
So, in order to do that,
you have to walk slowly.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.272
Not fast but slow.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.927
And receive the happiness
that I have to give.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.888
Receive it in your body.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
Okay, who is first?
Who is first?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.065
Okay, yes.

14:52.065 --> 14:55.198
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.070
Yes.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.989
You guys are done.
- Yeah.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.599
You can take off
your clothes.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.992
I'm just happy we got here

15:05.992 --> 15:08.646
because waking up
every Sunday

15:08.646 --> 15:10.953
to take them
to Sunday School,

15:10.953 --> 15:13.521
oh, no, you would've thought
I was a heathen.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.611
As far as the final count
for the communion,

15:16.611 --> 15:17.873
I already invited

15:17.873 --> 15:19.483
Karen, Candiace, and Ashley.
- Okay.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.225
We're planning
the kids' first communion,

15:22.225 --> 15:23.835
which is next week.
- Oh, yes, yes.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.054
And I want
you ladies to come.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.882
- I'm coming.
- First communion!

15:26.882 --> 15:29.015
And I invited Ashley
at her housewarming.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.799
Yeah, how-how was that?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.757
The housewarming
was good.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.064
Ashley brought
a new friend,

15:35.064 --> 15:37.023
and I thought she was cool
because Ashley was like,

15:37.023 --> 15:39.373
"Oh, she's Nigerian.
She's Igbo."

15:39.373 --> 15:41.375
- Okay, uh-huh.
- I was like, oh, this awesome.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.030
And then Ashley was
like, "But by the way,

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
when I was talking
to my friend,

15:45.988 --> 15:48.599
she, uh, brought up
this article about you."

15:48.599 --> 15:49.818
Mm-hmm.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.385
Something had happened
where there was

15:51.385 --> 15:53.300
some rumor about her family
being shunned or something.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.998
And I was just like
I've never met the girl.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.173
That's a red flag.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.783
Hey, hey, I love
this fit.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.002
- Thank you so much.
- So beautiful.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.047
Oh, thank you.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.094
I have seen her
in passing before.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.270
And then Ashley told me
that her friend was like,

16:07.270 --> 16:09.098
"What type of doctor
is she?"

16:09.098 --> 16:10.186
Wait, first of all,
Dr. Wendy,

16:10.186 --> 16:13.015
is this medical doctor?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.930
- No, It's a-a PhD.
- Okay.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.932
Okay, so,
Doctor of Philosophy.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.064
Now, you're trying
to shoot shots

16:18.064 --> 16:19.413
at your fellow Nigerian.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.980
It's just weird because
I've never met the girl.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.024
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.547
That's crazy.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.635
I don't know if this is
a woman you wanna be

16:24.635 --> 16:26.507
getting in, though.
I'm just saying.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.510
Coming up...

16:29.510 --> 16:32.078
I want them to be friends
'cause we have such a good time.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
I have a good time
with her, too.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.776
I have the cutest picture
of all three of us.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.083
But then she turns around
and stabs you

16:37.083 --> 16:38.693
in the side of your ear.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.101
Do you think it's
?

16:55.101 --> 16:57.059
Go let her in.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.887
Hello. Is that Juju?

16:58.887 --> 17:03.022
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.026
Hi, handsome.
How are you?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.375
Good to see you.
- Oh, okay.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.463
So, you come into my house,
and you can't hug.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.639
I-I-- good to
see you, Mia.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.075
A start.
- Can we hug?

17:13.075 --> 17:14.424
Oh, okay, this is how we start.
- Handshake first.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.124
This is beautiful, Mia.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.386
Well, welcome home.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.127
- Yes, ma'am. Okay.
- You like?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.780
You approve?
- I do. I do.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.391
I remember
the last penthouse.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.479
Yes.

17:25.479 --> 17:26.567
Beautiful.
You love a view, girl.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.308
- I do.
- And it's beautiful, Mia.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.092
I really like it.
It's you.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.094
- Take it, there you go.
- Perfect, darling.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.269
Mm-hmm, let's have
a seat over here,

17:33.269 --> 17:34.575
right here.
- Okay, we good?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.403
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you, darling.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.100
Okay.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.797
Daddy said he'd be here
in five minutes.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.930
Let's put our shoes on.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.454
They're gonna go scooter.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.282
Girl, listen,
city living, okay?

17:46.282 --> 17:47.892
Daddy.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.242
- Yay.
- Hey.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.113
Oh, you already scootered up.
- Hi, G.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.767
- Oh, you haven't seen Karen.
- Hey, Karen.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.247
Good to see you, G.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.118
- How are you, dear?
- I am good.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.119
- Good, good, good.
- Looking good.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.251
Oh, thank you.
You, too.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.948
Thank you.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.645
So, you gonna do
daddy duties, G?

18:01.645 --> 18:03.082
- Yes.
- I love it.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.387
I'm-I'm on the clock, now.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.085
With all the changes
that have been going on

18:06.085 --> 18:07.303
with the business,

18:07.303 --> 18:09.436
we have decided on pause
on having a nanny.

18:09.436 --> 18:14.963
Um, Gordon is a huge help,
and he is picking where he can,

18:14.963 --> 18:17.531
but kids are
everywhere-everywhere.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.880
Love you.
- All right, guys.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.229
- Bye, mommy.
- Bye, G.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.796
- Bye. I love you.
- Yep, okay. Love you, too.

18:21.796 --> 18:22.797
Um, make sure that they,
you know-- keep them on the--

18:22.797 --> 18:24.059
I got it. I got it.
I got it.

18:24.059 --> 18:24.886
Okay, and don't let them
run over anybody.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.627
- I got it.
- Okay, all right.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.499
- You see how she do me, Karen?
- Girl, micromanaging, I see.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.458
Oh.
- Babe, sometimes, you know.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.720
- It's all good.
- Right.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.244
But I do wanna thank you
for inviting me

18:35.244 --> 18:38.204
because you and I
were both at Ashley's, um,

18:38.204 --> 18:39.857
housewarming.
- Housewarming.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.860
But I could sense the tension,
though, among some of the women.

18:42.860 --> 18:43.992
Mm-hmm.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.167
Especially, uh,
when my girl, Wendy,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.474
invited everybody
that she wanted

18:47.474 --> 18:49.258
to the christening
of her children.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.868
It-it--

18:50.868 --> 18:52.870
So, what are your thoughts
on that, miss etiquette queen?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.221
I felt that that
invitation was personal

18:55.221 --> 18:56.657
coming from Wendy,
slighting Robyn

18:56.657 --> 18:58.267
sitting right there.
- Improper.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.314
But we also understand that
Robyn slighted her children,

19:01.314 --> 19:04.186
in her mind,
at the family event last year.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.274
Let me tell you something.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.319
This is another reason
why I can't

19:06.319 --> 19:08.016
move forward with her.
- Okay.

19:08.016 --> 19:11.585
Because when we were talking,
she decides to presume to say...

19:11.585 --> 19:15.110
You're so slow.
Like, I vibrate so high.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.068
Jeremiah does have an IEP,

19:17.068 --> 19:18.766
so he does have
special education.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.333
- I did not know that. I'm--
- And absolutely.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.117
And, you know,
he does have speech delay,

19:22.117 --> 19:23.379
and, of course,
we're working with it.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.555
And so, when she used--
- Right.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.730
I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

19:26.730 --> 19:27.949
Okay.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.430
Because I speak into him
that he's smart,

19:30.430 --> 19:32.693
and he's kind,
and he's-he's brilliant,

19:32.693 --> 19:33.694
and he is.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.217
So, it hits you
a certain way.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.045
And then kids are cruel, right?

19:37.045 --> 19:39.613
So, I've actually heard
other kids call him that.

19:39.613 --> 19:42.790
My son is my world,
and I don't want people

19:42.790 --> 19:46.620
to ever put him in
a classification of being slow.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.231
We know that that's just
not a word that you use, right?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.754
So, she needs to be
mindful of that.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.408
I'm not taking up for Wendy,
but I do know her to be

19:52.408 --> 19:55.933
a compassionate person
when she knows those-- I do.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.719
But she doesn't know anything
about your son's situation.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.764
She's also not trying
to get to know.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.375
I am not gonna be
in a position

20:02.375 --> 20:06.379
where I am going to choose or--
- You hump the fence.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.250
I own the fence.
I am the fence.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.035
Totally different.
All y'all hump my fence.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.396
Yes, okay.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.267
- How ya doin' today, ma'am?
- Hi.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.271
It's nice to meet you.
You want a PWA?

20:29.271 --> 20:30.620
- Pretty with a attitude.
- Absolutely, yes, ma'am.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.622
- Do I look like that?
- Every day.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.015
Thank you.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.758
- Take your time, ma'am.
- Hello.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.760
- Oh, you look cute.
- Oh, thank you.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.588
You look cute.
How you doin', mama?

20:41.588 --> 20:44.068
Hi.
Good, good, good.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.288
Girl, hold up.
Girl, how are you?

20:46.288 --> 20:47.550
So, I'm home.
I'm back home.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.769
Weren't you in L.A.
Where were you?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.423
I went to L.A. for two shows.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.947
♪ Passing I was speeding
on the freeway ♪

20:52.947 --> 20:54.296
♪ without a care

20:54.296 --> 20:57.212
♪ with my hands up in the air
air air air ♪

20:57.212 --> 20:58.518
And I had dancers.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.519
This is the club experience,
a club-- yeah.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.520
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.999
Girl, you missed
Ashley's housewarming.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.872
Oh, yes. Tell me.
Tell me somethin'.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.440
And wait, hold on.
Who is this girl that's coming?

21:07.440 --> 21:08.528
Where is she?

21:08.528 --> 21:10.660
- You have to meet Keiarna.
- Yes.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.315
She, actually,
two doors over from here,

21:13.315 --> 21:16.666
is her med spa wellness thing.
- Yes.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.799
She is a kiki.
She is a good time.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.454
Okay, we love that.
Is this her walking in?

21:21.454 --> 21:25.458
Hi.
- Yes, come on.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.329
Hey, baby.
- Hey, girl, I give hugs.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.157
How are you?
You're so cute.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.811
- Isn't she so cute?
- Thank you.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.247
Keiarna, this is Candiace.
Candiace, this is Keiarna.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.727
Hi, Candiace.
Oh, you guys are cute.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.989
- Nice to meet you.
- You look so cute.

21:34.989 --> 21:35.990
- Yes.
- Come on.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.165
Come on, feathers.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.601
So, your business
is literally right here.

21:38.601 --> 21:39.863
I saw this on the corner.
- I literally, yeah,

21:39.863 --> 21:41.300
I literally just walked
right down here.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.910
- Come here, miss mamas.
- Yes.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.477
Yes, miss mamas, honey.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.000
Okay, so, it's official. Welcome.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.091
K was actually at
my Wine With Wendy event.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.094
My number one concern
is understanding our resources

21:53.094 --> 21:55.662
so that we can really properly
run our businesses.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.491
- Yes, I remember!
- K asked a question.

21:58.491 --> 22:02.669
She had on the cute, little--
- Oh, I love that.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.061
- How we doing today, ladies?
- Oh.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.193
- Good.
- Great.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.499
I want the black swan.
- Absolutely.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.065
Let me get
the smoke and mirrors.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.502
All right.
Yes, ma'am.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.067
I can do that for your ladies.
- Thank you so much.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.460
Appreciate it.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.374
So, where are you--
'cause you have your store

22:12.374 --> 22:13.462
on the corner store.
- Yes.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.159
- Are you from Baltimore?
- I am a Baltimore girl.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.944
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:16.944 --> 22:20.382
So, Keiarna, our friend,
Ashley, had a housewarming event

22:20.382 --> 22:21.383
at her new--
- Your friend--

22:21.383 --> 22:22.776
that's your friend. Okay.
- Ooh.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.691
- That's my friend.
- Okay.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.040
Mm-hmm.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.346
Okay, and overall,
it was a good vibe, right?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.825
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.740
And while me and Ashley
were having the conversation

22:30.740 --> 22:32.873
about our relationship,
me and Ashley's relationship--

22:32.873 --> 22:34.222
Mm-hmm.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.790
She was like,
"And by the way, my new friend

22:36.790 --> 22:39.793
pulled up an article
about you from a blog."

22:39.793 --> 22:41.185
Mmm.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.491
Something had happened
where there was some rumor

22:42.491 --> 22:44.798
about her family being shunned
or something.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.322
Does she know you?
Do you know of her,

22:47.322 --> 22:49.455
or do you all have people
in common?

22:49.455 --> 22:54.416
Honestly, I met this girl
for the first time

22:54.416 --> 22:56.287
at Ashley's thing.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.420
If she knows me,
that's different.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.639
Okay, okay.

22:59.639 --> 23:00.901
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
are we all set

23:00.901 --> 23:03.817
and ready to order?
- I want pasta pomodoro.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.427
- I'm gonna do the lamb chops.
- Lamb chops.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.342
How you ladies want 'em cooked?
- Medium, please.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.648
- Medium, yes, ma'am.
- I knew it.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.692
I was gonna say,
she's married to a white man,

23:09.692 --> 23:10.084
so she probably
wants her medium.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.174
- I get mine medium well.
- Ooh, not well done.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.305
Medium well?

23:14.305 --> 23:16.743
You're-you're ruining
the meat, Wendy.

23:16.743 --> 23:19.310
So, did Ashley tell you this?

23:19.310 --> 23:20.703
- Yes.
- See...

23:20.703 --> 23:22.226
She said, when she had
the meeting with the girl,

23:22.226 --> 23:23.445
that's what happened.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.751
See, where-where
is the red flag?

23:24.751 --> 23:27.710
I think we have all learned,
at this juncture,

23:27.710 --> 23:30.278
that when Ashley
is coming to the people

23:30.278 --> 23:32.672
with information,
she is doing so

23:32.672 --> 23:35.762
from a place of a messy-ass ho.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.373
You know, Chris was being
a little bit flirty with her.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.288
Why are you trying to
dismiss my friend?

23:40.288 --> 23:41.550
Can you just
clear the air?

23:41.550 --> 23:42.812
She doesn't have
bad intentions with you.

23:42.812 --> 23:43.813
No.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.336
Glory to God,
look at that.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.468
- Ooh, oh, my God, thanks.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.730
- That is fabulous.
- Calamari.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.297
Oh, that's the calamari.
Oh, my God, today.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.865
- That's pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.607
Um, I'm having
a first communion.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.304
My boys are getting
their first communion

23:56.304 --> 23:57.740
on Saturday.
- Mmm, that's so nice.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.568
But then we're going to have
a brunch afterwards

23:59.568 --> 24:00.743
on Saturday.
- Nice.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.528
- And I want you there.
- Let's do it.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.833
Come through.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.400
And this is gonna be
Candiace and Ashley's

24:05.400 --> 24:07.402
first time seeing each other
in a minute.

24:07.402 --> 24:10.449
I want them to be friends
'cause we have such a good time.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.537
The cutest--

24:11.537 --> 24:12.929
I have a good time
with her, too.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.191
I have the cutest picture
of all three of us.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.019
But then she turns around
and stabs you

24:16.019 --> 24:17.456
in the side of your ear.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.544
Not endangering
in the earlobe.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.936
Beware.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.285
Coming up...

24:21.285 --> 24:22.809
I think that
when we were chatting about it,

24:22.809 --> 24:26.421
I may have implied that
to Wendy that Nneka was, like,

24:26.421 --> 24:29.772
sort of implying
that Wendy was Osu.

24:46.354 --> 24:51.185
Oh!
I just got bit.

24:53.709 --> 24:56.233
Hello.
- Hello.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.758
Oh, my God,
I hate to trouble you guys.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.977
Um, I just got bit by a bug.
Do you have a tissue?

25:00.977 --> 25:04.328
- Yes, we do.
- Oh, sorry. OMG.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.514
Hi.
How are you doing?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.645
Uh, I would be fine.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.907
I just got bit
by a bug, right here.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.953
- What?
- It feels like it's burning.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.041
Here, look, my bag
has a built-in mirror.

25:21.041 --> 25:21.955
Let me see. Let me see.
All right.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.218
Let me see.
How bad is it?

25:24.218 --> 25:26.568
- Oh, let me get this.
- Oh, it's horrible.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.962
It looks like
Ray socked me.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
Y'all got a little rough
or somethin'.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.748
No, but I wish that was it.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.446
How am I gonna show up
to Wendy's service

25:35.446 --> 25:39.755
if this gets any bigger?

25:39.755 --> 25:41.191
Hi. I'm Brianna.
This is Delaney.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.410
Hello.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.542
So, we're gonna be
your stylists today.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.499
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.761
You know,
I'm gonna be honest.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.111
Uh, not quite
what I typically would wear,

25:48.111 --> 25:49.852
but I'm excited to see
what you have.

25:49.852 --> 25:50.984
- Absolutely.
- We can surprise you.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.115
- Surprise, yes.
- Absolutely.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.160
Okay, great.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.727
This store,
while it's very nice

25:54.727 --> 25:56.293
for someone who is
a little more matronly,

25:56.293 --> 25:59.601
a little more conservative,
this does not fit my motif,

25:59.601 --> 26:00.689
but we just have to
find something

26:00.689 --> 26:02.691
to cover these new tits.

26:02.691 --> 26:03.997
Okay, Karen,
you trying on?

26:03.997 --> 26:05.738
I'm not gonna try on
because Wendy said

26:05.738 --> 26:09.045
we had to wear yellow.
- Oh, see, I-I hear you.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.700
There's yellow in it, though.
What do you have?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.310
Oh.
- So, I'm gonna be okay.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.051
You try yours on.
- Okay, I'll try this on.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.618
And then I'll help you,
but we'll talk about.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.141
You can even wear
that to the-the communion.

26:18.141 --> 26:21.492
- Girl, it's too short.
- God like a little leg, girl.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.493
- I'll be back.
- All right.

26:22.493 --> 26:23.756
Thank you.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.148
I'll wait here, Ashley,
for the unveiling.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.280
All right.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.368
I would buy a dress
from this shop

26:27.368 --> 26:28.891
if I could find
something to wear.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.719
If it don't-- if it does not
have a titty or a ass out,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.242
Ashley is not
going to wear it.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.723
- Here I am.
- Oh, girl, all right now.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.595
- Yes, I actually like it.
- You got a body-ody.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.640
It is cute.
- Yes.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.207
That is very nice.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.035
My boobs hold it up
really nicely.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.645
Like, I don't know
if my previous set

26:43.645 --> 26:45.212
would have had the same effect.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.692
Is that braless
with the boobs?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.084
- Yeah, this is braless.
- Go ahead, girl.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.869
- Yeah, girl.
- I have a question for you.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.348
I did go to see Candiace.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.176
You know, you guys are gonna be
with Wendy tomorrow.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.483
- Mm-hmm.
- How you feeling about that?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.790
She's made it clear she wants
no correspondence with me,

26:57.790 --> 26:59.443
and that is completely fine
with me, Karen.

26:59.443 --> 27:03.230
I shared with her that it was
odd and really strange to me

27:03.230 --> 27:06.755
that no one brought her name up
at your housewarming.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.844
If something--
- I would prefer that they don't

27:08.844 --> 27:10.237
bring up my name.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.718
I know an icy situation
when I see one.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.242
Ice a bitch out 101,
is don't mention her name.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.373
I've been there.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.853
All right.
Whew, back in my clothes.

27:17.853 --> 27:21.204
Girl, can you tell me anything
about this damn lawsuit

27:21.204 --> 27:23.163
that Michael has started?
Um...

27:23.163 --> 27:25.556
You would know more than me
since you talk to Candiace.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
She won't talk to me
about it. No.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.082
He-he won't talk
about it either.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.388
Michael is suing
you for $2 million.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.433
Uh-uh.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.695
With regard
to the lawsuit,

27:33.695 --> 27:35.479
I'm not answering
any questions about it.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.917
I'm disappointed that
he felt he had to come up

27:37.917 --> 27:39.353
with a lawsuit to do it.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.398
I think Michael is
trying to make a point,

27:41.398 --> 27:42.704
but was it
worth $2 million?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.401
No, maybe two pennies.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.882
That's more realistic
because we've all heard this.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.188
Candiace just has
a wonderful way

27:48.188 --> 27:50.886
of putting the-the butter
to the bread

27:50.886 --> 27:52.496
when it comes to cutting
somebody's throat.

27:53.889 --> 27:54.847
Can I-- can we go somewhere
I can sit down, too?

27:54.847 --> 27:56.587
My-my bunions are hurting.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.024
Okay, are you
gonna have surgery?

27:58.024 --> 27:59.416
It's, like, three months
of recovery,

27:59.416 --> 28:01.114
and I have two young kids.
You know, so...

28:01.114 --> 28:03.551
Yes, who are adorable
and growing up way,

28:03.551 --> 28:05.248
way too fast for me.
- Thank you.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.033
So, I'm like,
oh, my God.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.730
Mia, girl, when I went to
visit her the other day,

28:08.730 --> 28:10.123
we had such a good
time at her house.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.733
Juju is so funny.
- Yeah.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.430
Her son is super fun.

28:13.430 --> 28:17.086
And, for me, it was very painful
to hear about what she had

28:17.086 --> 28:20.133
to say that transpired
between she and Wendy.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.744
Basically, Wendy
said she was slow.

28:24.224 --> 28:27.227
Well, it would be funny
if Mia wasn't dealing with

28:27.227 --> 28:29.795
her son having
a speech impediment.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.756
You know, Wendy is saying
that Mia was slow.

28:34.756 --> 28:37.237
Of course, that cut Mia.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.282
Is Mia really hurt that
someone called her slow?

28:39.282 --> 28:40.588
I don't think so.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.373
But if it's gonna help
prove a point for her

28:43.373 --> 28:46.289
and, you know, have
some oomph, then, by golly,

28:46.289 --> 28:48.204
Mia is gonna ride it off
into the sunset.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.466
If there is one thing
Mia can do, honey,

28:49.466 --> 28:52.295
is she can ride it out.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.557
Well, this is good.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.950
I'm actually excited
to see Wendy tomorrow.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.778
Uh, you know, I was
just thinking about

28:56.778 --> 28:58.867
I had this conversation
with Nneka first.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.434
Okay.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.218
And we were just kinda, like,
chatting about this stuff

29:02.218 --> 29:04.177
about Wendy and that she was,
like, Osu or something,

29:04.177 --> 29:06.179
and I didn't know
what any of it was.

29:06.179 --> 29:09.312
So, yeah, Nneka educated me.
- So, what's Osu?

29:09.312 --> 29:11.967
Essentially,
it's like an outcast.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.926
So, then I told Wendy that
we had talked about it.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.971
I think that when we
were chatting about it,

29:15.971 --> 29:19.148
I may have implied that,
to Wendy, that Nneka was,

29:19.148 --> 29:23.152
like, sort of implying
that Wendy was Osu.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.505
Nneka said
she was Osu?

29:28.505 --> 29:31.987
No, I-I said she may have
implied that she was Osu.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.510
I don't--
- What did-- what did Nneka say?

29:33.510 --> 29:35.512
Here's the thing.
Nneka didn't say anything.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.123
Yeah, Osu is-is a thing.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.995
I don't know if she is.
I know I'm not.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.171
So, you made the sh-- up.
Were you being messy?

29:42.171 --> 29:44.870
- No, I mis-remembered.
- Okay.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.828
After the Jose...

29:46.828 --> 29:48.438
was out of my veins,

29:48.438 --> 29:50.745
I started to remember
the situation differently.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.529
I think I put
too much sauce on it,

29:52.529 --> 29:55.054
and I implied that Nneka was
the one who brought it up,

29:55.054 --> 29:56.359
and that's not right.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.970
So, I feel really
guilty about it,

29:57.970 --> 29:59.362
and I do wanna set
that record straight.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.191
Girl, Ashley
got a wooden leg.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.976
When she drinks, it goes
straight to her big toe

30:03.976 --> 30:06.108
and stay there.
"Oh, it's gone to my head."

30:06.108 --> 30:08.023
No, it went to
that bunion in your toe.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.982
That's why it
look like that.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.419
So, now I just have to
sort of, like, you know,

30:12.419 --> 30:14.203
clear it up with Wendy and--
- Make it right.

30:14.203 --> 30:17.119
Girl, girl, all right.

30:17.119 --> 30:20.514
I'm just buckling up.
My God.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.037
Coming up...

30:22.037 --> 30:23.386
Are you excited to pray
or something, 'cause who is--

30:23.386 --> 30:24.866
I'm praying?

30:24.866 --> 30:28.435
I'm supposed to pray.
They are my children.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.857
This is where we're having
your brunch, guys.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.251
Okay, with
the yellow flowers.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.993
The first communion
was a success.

31:04.993 --> 31:08.562
My boys were nervous,
but they just walked up

31:08.562 --> 31:11.478
to the priest,
received it, bowed,

31:11.478 --> 31:14.307
and I was just
a proud Catholic mother.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.092
It was everything
I could dream of.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.746
How are you guys feeling?
- Good.

31:18.746 --> 31:19.878
You didn't drop it.
Priest didn't hem you up,

31:19.878 --> 31:20.922
you know.
- You didn't stumble.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.184
You did good.

31:22.184 --> 31:25.796
Hey.
- Hey, how are you doing?

31:25.796 --> 31:26.972
- How you, brother? Congrats.
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.538
- The kids ran of us.
- Welcome, Papa.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.498
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.238
Hey, mama.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.025
Do we pray now or wait?

31:37.025 --> 31:38.505
Are you excited to pray
or something

31:38.505 --> 31:41.029
'cause who is-- I'm praying?
- I'm supposed to pray.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.031
They are my children.

31:46.165 --> 31:50.517
If I didn't birth you,
you wouldn't have birthed them.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.735
Can I have what
she's drinking?

31:51.735 --> 31:53.781
Girl...

31:57.002 --> 31:59.874
How have you been?
Oh, my God.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.137
How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.791
Thank you.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.536
- Oh, Karen!
- Wendy. Hi, mama.

32:09.536 --> 32:13.540
Belle of the ball,
you look so good.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.021
How are you?
- Thank you. Fantastic.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.544
Look at mommy.
- Oh, I'm trying.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.024
Everybody, you know Miss Karen.
- Hello, Karen.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.069
Eddie, hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.157
Welcome.
Good to see you, as well.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.724
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

32:23.724 --> 32:24.768
This is so beautiful.
- Oh, definitely.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.118
Boys, Karter,
Kruz, Miss Karen.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.772
Congratulations, boys.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.950
- Yes, bride. Look at the bride.
- You look beautiful.

32:32.994 --> 32:36.563
Hi. Oh, this is
such a cute hat.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.130
This is beautiful.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.958
Look at Black sunshine.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.438
Hello. Come on.
- How are you?

32:42.438 --> 32:44.353
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.921
- Thank you so much.
- We can sit down.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.793
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is Mia coming?

32:49.793 --> 32:53.623
I wanna make sure, so we get
prepared with more drinks,

32:53.623 --> 32:57.149
and I can get my raincoat
from the car.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.020
- Ahh!
- Thank you.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.369
- Yes.
- I'm trying--

33:00.369 --> 33:01.588
I'm trying to tell you.
- Did she just come up--

33:01.588 --> 33:02.981
did she just come up
and clear the table?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.808
- Cleared the whole table.
- Oh, my God. Girl, you--

33:04.808 --> 33:07.811
Oh, my God.

33:07.811 --> 33:11.554
If anybody hurts her babies,
she turns into mama bear.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.860
- Yes.
- And she wants to protect them.

33:12.860 --> 33:17.604
Right. I--

33:17.604 --> 33:19.388
- How you doin', man?
- Good.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.086
- You're getting big, boy.
- Thank you.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.652
- Hey, beautiful.
- You look gorgeous.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.089
Oh, yes, I love it
... You look beautiful.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.481
- I love this. You look so good.
- Thank you.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.962
- K, this is Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.790
- Very nice to meet you.
- I like that.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.966
- You met-- you met,
uh, Candi, girl.
- Miss mama-- Miss mama.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.664
- She's a real boss.
- Real girl boss.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.797
- Hi.
- Hey, Ashley.

33:36.797 --> 33:37.885
- Hi.
- Sorry, babe.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.234
I didn't know
where you were.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.106
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi. I'm sorry I'm late, girl.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.411
No, no, you're fine.
You look so good.

33:42.411 --> 33:43.673
- And I'm sorry about my girls.
- It's okay.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.284
But I haven't learned
how to dress them.

33:45.284 --> 33:48.287
Is this too ho'ish
for a communion?

33:48.287 --> 33:49.984
Just cover it up.

33:49.984 --> 33:52.117
Put them away
'cause God didn't--

33:52.117 --> 33:54.293
this-this is--
God is not pleased.

33:54.293 --> 33:55.685
Candiace, can
you move your bag?

33:55.685 --> 33:57.818
Oh, can we get another chair
then for my purse?

33:57.818 --> 34:00.212
- Yes, we can.
- Yes, where is my friend?

34:00.212 --> 34:02.823
- How are you? How is it going?
- Going well.

34:02.823 --> 34:05.304
I'm loving the mimosa and--
- Yeah, we need a purse chair.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.525
Ashley, this is
my friend, Keiarna.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.744
Keiarna, this is Ashley.
- Hi, Ashley.

34:10.744 --> 34:13.442
- You are gorgeous.
- Thank you. Ditto.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.401
Ooh, the food is coming.
All I see is shrimp.

34:15.401 --> 34:18.056
Oh, I'm just on time then.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.753
My first communion
was the first time

34:19.753 --> 34:22.190
that I remember getting
really, really dolled up,

34:22.190 --> 34:26.499
and my aunts and uncles came,
and then we all went out to eat

34:26.499 --> 34:30.068
at Golden Corral afterwards.
I felt like a celebrity.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.158
- What?
- Sorry.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.290
- Ow.
- Sorry. Ha-ha!

34:35.290 --> 34:37.684
You look good, man.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.773
I'm proud of you.
You did good today.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.211
This looks good.
Is everybody okay?

34:43.211 --> 34:44.604
I'm good.

34:44.604 --> 34:47.389
Well, can I just say I
just appreciate you ladies

34:47.389 --> 34:49.087
for coming for not just me?
- Yeah, girl.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.566
This is above me.
My babies--

34:50.566 --> 34:52.177
this is my babies' event.
- Yes, girl.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.136
And even more importantly,
elephant in the room, you two,

34:55.136 --> 34:59.488
because you two have
your own issues.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.664
But I will say,
Wendy, to your point

35:01.664 --> 35:06.452
and to-to you, Ashley,
that I will always be okay

35:06.452 --> 35:09.411
being in a room
with-with you.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.282
I echo that,
and I respect that.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.806
Yeah.

35:12.806 --> 35:16.375
On that note, have you guys
heard of pickleball?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.680
- Is that like tennis?
- No, what's that?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.812
- It's like tennis.
- Where y'all been?

35:18.812 --> 35:19.900
Have y'all been
living under a rock?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.728
Well, it's a new sport.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.730
Ray is the expert
on pickleball.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.602
So, I thought, well,
let me steal Ray's idea.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.430
- Yes.
- So, I'm inviting everyone

35:28.430 --> 35:30.737
and their significant others.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.608
You can bring your husbands,
your boyfriends, your girl--

35:32.608 --> 35:33.783
- To pickleball.
- If you're comfortable.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.307
I'm gonna get
my Serena Williams on.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.396
- Okay.
- So, are you guys down?

35:37.396 --> 35:38.614
- I'm down.
- I'm down.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.007
All right.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.748
I wanna say to you,
Wendy, that, you know,

35:41.748 --> 35:43.489
you and I had
our talk about Nneka

35:43.489 --> 35:46.622
and the conversation
I had with Nneka.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.800
And I wanna clear up that
I think I may have implied

35:50.800 --> 35:53.716
that she said that
about you being Osu,

35:53.716 --> 35:56.328
but she didn't.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.984
Coming up...

36:00.984 --> 36:02.072
She proceeded to say,

36:02.072 --> 36:03.944
"Have I ever prayed
against you?"

36:03.944 --> 36:05.815
And then she started
saying that it's a sin

36:05.815 --> 36:08.340
to use somebody's name.
- Oh, my God.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.732
And that she
has a shrine.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.565
I wanna say to you, Wendy,
that I think I may have implied

36:16.565 --> 36:19.133
that she said that
about you being Osu,

36:19.133 --> 36:20.047
but she didn't.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.313
I misrepresented that.
- Huh?

36:25.313 --> 36:28.447
But, Ashley, you told me
she came at you

36:28.447 --> 36:31.493
real, like, "Oh,
it's such a bad thing.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.930
I'm not a part of this,
but Wendy is."

36:33.930 --> 36:35.323
- Oh, did she do that?
- No, I didn't say

36:35.323 --> 36:36.890
she said
you were a part of it.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.631
Oh.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.763
No, I did not.
Babe, I did not say that.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.331
And she made it very clear
that she does not think

36:43.331 --> 36:44.680
you are that
or anything like that.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.768
Okay.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.292
If I told you that,
I apologize.

36:47.292 --> 36:50.817
That's certainly not what
I ever intended to do with that.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.035
I told you.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.646
It's not even worth
getting upset over,

36:53.646 --> 36:57.084
losing a-a piece of hair over,
because Ashley is a liar.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.477
She's a bald-faced liar.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.652
That's why her
forehead is so big.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.697
It's just--
it's full of lies.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.786
I have no issue
with her,

37:03.786 --> 37:05.614
but thank you
for being honest.

37:05.614 --> 37:06.789
It's time for them
to cut the cake.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.878
- Oh, is there cake?
- Yes.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.271
That's wonderful.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.890
Hello.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.589
Nneka, you look
so beautiful.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.808
I love this color.
- Hey, you look beautiful.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.245
It's so nice
seeing you again.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.637
Yes. Do you want
something?

37:28.637 --> 37:30.117
I was, like,
a little chilly out here,

37:30.117 --> 37:31.249
so I ordered hot chocolate.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.598
Oh, wow, you ordered
hot chocolate.

37:32.598 --> 37:33.903
Wow, so good of you.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.862
I was thinking more
of a cold beverage.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.298
I know.
Well, I want that, too.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.257
But I'm like I need to,
like, warm up.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.649
Thank you so much.

37:40.649 --> 37:41.998
Do you wanna start
with something?

37:41.998 --> 37:45.175
I am going to do
the Margarita Nacional.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.394
- Sure.
- All right. I'll get

37:46.394 --> 37:47.569
the Chinola Spritz.
- Chinola Spritz, yes.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.093
- Yeah, Chinola. Chinola Spritz.
- Okay.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.921
Thank you.

37:51.921 --> 37:55.751
Nneka seems really nice
and friendly.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.927
Did you throw on an accent
for that, Chinola Spritz?

37:57.927 --> 37:59.755
Yeah, I said, 'Chinola."

37:59.755 --> 38:01.104
You know,
I'm looking forward

38:01.104 --> 38:03.019
to just getting to know her
a little bit more.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.194
Oh.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.240
This is your
Chinola Spritz.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.328
This is your
Margarita Nacional.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.329
It's like a beach
or something.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.679
- I know.
- Sure.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.333
Um, Ashley's house
is so adorable.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.900
It was so cute.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.945
Ashley is, like, you know,
she's so, like, one of a kind.

38:15.945 --> 38:17.469
- Mm-hmm.
- And so, her house was,

38:17.469 --> 38:19.645
like, totally fit for her.
- Right.

38:19.645 --> 38:21.777
Like, you only
know Ashley?

38:21.777 --> 38:24.780
I only know Ashley,
but I've met Wendy.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.869
I don't know her,
but I know of her.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.175
Okay.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.785
I had a conversation
with her at an event.

38:29.785 --> 38:32.614
It sounded like you all were
meeting for the first time.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.964
- Hey, hey, I love this fit.
- Thank you so much.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.749
- So beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.620
Listen, if she wants to meet
for the first time,

38:38.620 --> 38:39.708
we can meet for
the first time.

38:39.708 --> 38:40.970
I'm not--
- Like, but is that what--

38:40.970 --> 38:42.102
how the exchange went?
- But it's not true.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.582
That's how it was.
- It really-- it--

38:43.582 --> 38:46.193
It was like her being, like,
being introduced to me

38:46.193 --> 38:47.368
for the first time.
- Okay,

38:47.368 --> 38:49.239
but neither one
of you were like,

38:49.239 --> 38:50.458
"Yeah, we know
each other."

38:50.458 --> 38:52.330
Or, "Hey, hey, girl."
- No, no.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.549
I've met Wendy
at a concert,

38:54.549 --> 38:56.290
and I saw her
at a birthday party.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.031
Like, she was
with her husband,

38:58.031 --> 38:59.424
and I just, you know,
I saw them.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.599
I normally
would have smiled,

39:00.599 --> 39:03.341
but I was met
with just eyebrows

39:03.341 --> 39:06.387
and just glares.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.911
So, I just took
my Louboutin pumps,

39:08.911 --> 39:10.913
and we scurried
to the restroom.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.350
I wasn't expecting that.
- Mm-hmm.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.090
I was expecting more, like,
aggression from her.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.528
- Why?
- Because the past three weeks,

39:16.528 --> 39:19.748
her family has been really
aggressive towards me.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.576
- What?
- Yeah.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.364
- Okay.
- Because she's been friends

39:26.364 --> 39:27.277
with them for,
like, 13 years.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.931
So, Ivy called her
one day

39:28.931 --> 39:30.716
saying that
Wendy was upset

39:30.716 --> 39:32.674
because I'm
using her name

39:32.674 --> 39:34.850
to socialize
with you women.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.112
What?

39:36.112 --> 39:38.201
So, she was calling me
all sorts of names.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.246
- What?
- Clout chaser,

39:39.246 --> 39:40.508
that I need
a restraining order,

39:40.508 --> 39:42.205
and if she--
- Huh? Restraining order?

39:42.205 --> 39:43.250
Yes.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.469
Because you said
you knew her?

39:44.469 --> 39:45.557
And I don't
even know her,

39:45.557 --> 39:46.949
because I said
my in-law knows her,

39:46.949 --> 39:49.212
but I've met her,
which is all true.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.084
Excuse me, everyone.

39:51.084 --> 39:54.566
Can I get your
attention, please?

39:54.566 --> 39:57.830
Thank you all for coming
and being here

39:57.830 --> 40:00.180
since their baptism
when they were this small.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.443
Thank you and know that,
as you take this next step,

40:02.443 --> 40:03.749
this is
your community.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.011
This is your village.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.969
Fast forward
a couple of days later.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.231
Oh, my God,
this keeps going?

40:08.231 --> 40:10.625
Wendy's mom calls
my husband's cousin.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.453
Stop! What?

40:12.453 --> 40:13.585
It starts off
super creepy.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.456
Like, "Have I prayed
with you before?"

40:15.456 --> 40:17.110
And my in-law
is like, "Auntie,"

40:17.110 --> 40:18.285
'cause that's how
you greet your elders,

40:18.285 --> 40:19.765
"Auntie, like,
we've been family friends

40:19.765 --> 40:20.766
for a long time,
so, I'm sure

40:20.766 --> 40:21.854
you've prayed for me."
- Yeah.

40:21.854 --> 40:22.942
And she proceeds to say,

40:22.942 --> 40:25.553
"Have I ever prayed
against you?"

40:25.553 --> 40:28.121
And then she started saying
that it's a sin

40:28.121 --> 40:30.732
to use somebody's name.
- Oh, my God.

40:30.732 --> 40:31.690
And that
she has a shrine.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.822
She has a shrine,

40:33.822 --> 40:36.738
and that's where she puts
the names of people.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.567
What? She's doing
voodoo on you?

40:39.567 --> 40:42.135
This woman
put a hex on me.

40:42.135 --> 40:46.748
Today, I stand here
fully blessed

40:46.748 --> 40:50.360
because these are
my children.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.450
I birthed them.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.799
Come on now.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.931
- Oh, my.
- So, Father,

40:55.931 --> 40:59.108
I pray and thank you
for these two young men.

40:59.108 --> 41:02.460
- Amen.
- My Lord and my God,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.113
no weapon fashioned

41:04.113 --> 41:06.507
against anyone
standing here today

41:06.507 --> 41:08.161
will prosper.
In Jesus' name.

41:08.161 --> 41:09.597
Amen.

41:09.597 --> 41:10.946
- Did you dream this?
- And then, no,

41:10.946 --> 41:12.513
and then she says that
we should ask about her

41:12.513 --> 41:14.472
in the DMV.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.864
Ask about who?

41:15.864 --> 41:18.780
Wendy's mom and her shrine
and her prayers,

41:18.780 --> 41:20.782
"And check on those people
who I've prayed against

41:20.782 --> 41:23.524
and see how they're doing.
They're not doing well."

41:23.524 --> 41:24.960
- I'm freaked out.
- I'm telling you.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.353
- What the ?
- It was crazy. It was crazy.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.661
Karter and Kruz,
today you have received

41:29.661 --> 41:32.011
the body and blood
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

41:32.011 --> 41:34.317
You are protected.
- Yes.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.623
You are powerful!

41:35.623 --> 41:38.583
I know you all are
from the same culture,

41:38.583 --> 41:40.323
the same tribe.
Is this normal?

41:40.323 --> 41:41.890
- Unh-unh.
- Okay.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.326
'Cause culturally, like,
we're supposed to be sisters,

41:43.326 --> 41:44.719
you know.
- Right.

41:44.719 --> 41:47.200
He said, "Suffer the children
to come to me."

41:47.200 --> 41:49.332
In Jesus name, I pray.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.682
Amen.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.074
This is, like,
so creepy.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.989
I've had a lot of sh--
going on in my life,

41:53.989 --> 41:55.164
and I'm starting to think

41:55.164 --> 41:56.818
that Wendy's mother
put a hex on me.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.037
- She did.
- That she prayed against me.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.038
Yeah, we are both--

41:59.038 --> 42:01.170
She threw my name somewhere.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.568
Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Potomac."

42:07.568 --> 42:08.613
I mean,
I know y'all talked,

42:08.613 --> 42:09.875
but I didn't hear
what y'all said.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.703
He-he kinda
came for me,

42:11.703 --> 42:15.924
and you didn't, like, say,
"Hold up, Juan."

42:15.924 --> 42:17.535
- Oh, my God.
- What's up, guys?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.493
Is that Juan Dixon,

42:19.493 --> 42:21.016
playa-playa
from the Himalayas?

42:21.016 --> 42:23.366
I'm aware of the phone call
your mom made to my in-law

42:23.366 --> 42:25.543
saying that she submitted
my name to a shrine.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.196
- Voodoo.
- A shrine is like voodoo.

42:27.196 --> 42:30.591
I think that you--

42:30.591 --> 42:33.028
This is the demons
coming to get us.
