I wanted to do
something special,

Cap'n Crunch pancakes

00:15.716 --> 00:18.052

Where's the pack
of frozen strawberries?

Oh, I was using it
as a cold pack in bed

00:30.931 --> 00:32.866
for my sore shoulder.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.070
If you need a cold pack,
use the frozen broccoli!

00:36.104 --> 00:38.872
That's the only reason
we buy it.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.342
I don't like having broccoli
that close to my mouth,

for Beverly Rose.

a pencil case.

Wow. You looking
to hit on the teacher?

"Buy me a sandwich
and I'm yours."

No. I just want to make
a good impression on him.

So you're sucking up.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.879
You know that sends a message
to your kid, right?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.982
There is nothing wrong with
trying to be the teacher's pet.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.718
You gotta work the system
to succeed.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.554
Is that why you always
dressed like your teacher

01:26.587 --> 01:28.556
when you were a kid?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.659
First of all, I look great
in knit separates.

01:31.692 --> 01:32.926
And it worked.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.563
She loved me so much,
I doubled my wardrobe

and her new love became pie.

coming up?

of her first day of school.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.144
My mom said
I was too plain to like,

01:50.178 --> 01:52.246
so she told me
to put on a skirt,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.148
climb up to the top
of the jungle gym,

01:54.182 --> 01:55.816
and, that way,
at least I'd be popular

01:55.849 --> 01:57.951

on the bottom.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.287
But it didn't work,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.355
so she made sure
I had a wad of dollar bills

02:01.389 --> 02:04.792
I could pass out
so the boys would talk to me.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.960

of being a striper.

and gave them money.

Go ahead and eat that
in the kitchen, hon.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.555
But don't let Grandpa see it,
or the clogged artery monster

19:48.588 --> 19:50.323
will come and get him
in the night!

19:50.357 --> 19:52.725
Okay.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.494
Ice-cream cone
right before dinner?
[ Door closes ]

19:54.527 --> 19:55.695
Bad day, Mom?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.697
Horrible.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.132
I found out Darlene
was right about something.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.237
And now I'm putting down
my phone.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.574
You had a point.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.277
I didn't listen.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.012
I was so anxious
to please the teacher,

20:13.045 --> 20:16.048
I made Beverly Rose
scared to talk.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.884
Oh, well, you don't
have to apologize.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.886
I didn't apologize.
I said you were right.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.557
Well, I shouldn't have
gotten involved.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.426
You know what I think
you both learned?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.529
Is that Beverly Rose
shouldn't be you or you.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.931
She'll figure out who
she's supposed to be -- me.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.069
Yeah, if you strip away all
the layers of self-loathing.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.707
And the crazy that
chills you to the bone,

20:40.740 --> 20:41.974
you have...

20:42.008 --> 20:43.576
A shirt and a haircut
that belong

20:43.610 --> 20:45.545
on a sculpture
in New Mexico?

20:45.578 --> 20:48.615
[ Humming Reiki chant ]
Fbpht!

20:48.648 --> 20:50.450
[ Humming Reiki chant ]
Fbpht!

20:52.685 --> 20:55.087

20:57.957 --> 21:00.393
Grandpa, I brought you
an ice-cream sandwich.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.995
I want to see the clogged
artery monster come and get you.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.597
Where did you hear that?

21:04.631 --> 21:07.500
Mommy, Aunt Jackie,
Aunt Darlene.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.602
Were they
planning something?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.170
Because if they were
hoping to see

21:11.203 --> 21:13.573
the term life insurance
monster,

21:13.606 --> 21:16.809
I transformed him into
a mortgage payment monster

21:16.843 --> 21:19.078
and a new sewer line!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.448
[Gravelly] And now
I'm a new kind of monster.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.916
Give me that
ice-cream sandwich!

21:23.950 --> 21:26.118
And you're awful sweet.
I'm gonna eat you up, too!

21:26.152 --> 21:27.487

Dan growling ]
