WEBVTT

00:10.097 --> 00:12.360
Ah, happy trash day, Calvin.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.274
Wow.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.493
White people celebrate anything.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.498
So, got any big plans
this weekend?

00:20.542 --> 00:23.675
Well, I was planning on going
down to the trash day parade.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.288
But instead I got to take Tina

00:27.331 --> 00:29.290
to this concert on Saturday.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.682
Oh, yeah?
Who are you guys seeing?

00:30.726 --> 00:32.336
REO Speedwagon.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.121
Hey, brother!

00:34.164 --> 00:36.079
I ride the Speedwagon, too.

00:37.689 --> 00:40.344
You know, first time I saw them
in concert was the summer of...

00:40.388 --> 00:42.738
Can we just go back
to talking about trash?

00:42.781 --> 00:45.306
Wait a minute, you
mean you're not a fan?

00:45.349 --> 00:47.525
Ah. Oh, no. It's all Tina.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.354
She drags me to see 'em
every time they come to town.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.096
That's what happens
when you bus a black kid

00:53.140 --> 00:55.359
to a white middle school.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.536
: Well, do you
at least have good seats?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.364
Well, they're in
hearing distance of the stage,

01:00.408 --> 01:02.410
so I'm gonna say no.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.281
Well, I tell you,

01:04.325 --> 01:06.327
they are one of the
best bands to see live.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.329
Better than when I
saw Boston in Boston.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.418
Or Chicago in Chicago.

01:10.461 --> 01:14.378
Definitely better than when
I saw Kansas in Montreal.

01:14.422 --> 01:17.077
Oh, oh, hey. You know what,
in that case, uh,

01:17.120 --> 01:18.513
you want to go?

01:18.556 --> 01:20.602
Are you kidding? I'd love to.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.343
Great. Pick Tina up at 7:00.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.909
You two will have a great time.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.650
Wait, hold on.

01:25.694 --> 01:26.695
You're not coming with?

01:26.738 --> 01:28.697
Nope. Look at that.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.916
It did turn out
to be a happy trash day.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.094
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:34.137 --> 01:35.443
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.625
This concert is
gonna be epic.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.670
I am so amped!

01:45.714 --> 01:47.063
I know.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.630
You've been singing
"I Can't Fight This Feeling"

01:48.673 --> 01:50.240
since yesterday.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.155
Well, what could I say?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.635
I couldn't fight the feeling.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.158
Okay.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.551
What else can you tell me
about Tina?

01:56.594 --> 01:58.161
You said that she loves
to garden,

01:58.205 --> 01:59.858
she-she really likes to sing,

01:59.902 --> 02:01.860
and she don't got time for this.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.647
What exactly is "this"?

02:05.690 --> 02:07.214
I don't know, Dave.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.693
She just doesn't have time
for it.

02:10.304 --> 02:13.133
Why are you asking
all these questions?

02:13.176 --> 02:15.309
Well, because you two are
already such good friends,

02:15.352 --> 02:17.267
and this is the first time
that Tina and I

02:17.311 --> 02:18.486
have hung out one-on-one,

02:18.529 --> 02:21.141
and I just want to
make sure she has fun.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.622
That-that she isn't intimidated
by my coolness.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.192
If cool's what you're going for,

02:29.236 --> 02:31.325
you might want to leave
your air guitar at home.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.936
Hmm. Sorry, babe.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.243
I just got it restrung.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.899
Okay, now, let's talk attire.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.206
Guns in?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.208
Guns out?

02:46.818 --> 02:49.212
Dave, I love you,
but I don't got time for this.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.262
Hey, Malcolm,
when did you order that pizza?

02:55.305 --> 02:58.308
Uh, just about 25 minutes ago.Oh!

02:58.352 --> 03:00.267
So five more minutes
and it's free.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.184
Fingers crossed, the driver
gets into an accident.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.230
Oh, Pop, that's terrible.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.666
Oh, just a fender bender.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.277
So the cheese don't slide.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.236
Oh, hey,
if you want to do something

03:13.280 --> 03:14.672
instead of watching TV tonight,

03:14.716 --> 03:16.805
we can go outside and check out
that meteor shower.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.024
Ooh, science stuff.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.287
Yeah.Pass.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.246
Hey, I don't know, Pop.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.813
That actually sounds
pretty cool.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.728
Really?Nope. Hard pass.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.252
Come on, guys.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.689
It's the Leonids meteor shower.
It's the big one

03:31.733 --> 03:33.300
that only happens
every 33 years.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.867
Great. Put me down
for the next one.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.262
Oh, that's the pizza.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.916
I'll get it.You know what?

03:40.959 --> 03:41.960
Let me give you some money.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.310
Ah, don't worry about it, Pop.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.267
It's on me.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.529
You're paying?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.053
Forget your meteor.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.317
Now, that happens less
than every 33 years.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.058
Very, very funny,

03:53.102 --> 03:55.496
but I have a job now,

03:55.539 --> 03:58.238
so let me feed the family.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.717
Veggie pizza?

03:59.761 --> 04:02.024
What family you trying to feed?

04:03.330 --> 04:06.376
Well, to quote you
for the last 20 years,

04:06.420 --> 04:09.074
"I pay, I pick, you shut up."

04:11.338 --> 04:12.513
Did you just tell me to shut up?

04:12.556 --> 04:14.210
No, he was quoting you,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.168
so technically youtold you
to shut up.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.996
Shut up.Got it.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.217
Malcolm, what's gotten
into you lately?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.045
Well, I'm paying
for myself these days,

04:23.088 --> 04:25.395
which means
now I get a say in things.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.614
And right now I say...

04:26.657 --> 04:29.834
"Mmm, mmm! Broccolini."

04:33.490 --> 04:35.013
Smart-ass.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.409
Hey, Gemma, what's up?

04:39.453 --> 04:40.802
I have a problem.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.413
Uh-oh. Is Crackhead Victor
"entertaining"

04:43.457 --> 04:44.762
in your car again?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.374
No.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.290
A bird flew into our house,
and I can't get it out.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.639
Oh. Just offer him

04:51.682 --> 04:52.770
a piece of this damn pizza.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.076
He'll leave.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.557
Actually, birds eat vegetables,

04:56.600 --> 04:57.775
so that might work.

04:57.819 --> 04:58.820
I told you to shut up.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.039
Yep.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.483
Where does a parrot
even come from?

05:09.526 --> 05:12.442
I bet it belongs to that pirate
who lives around the corner.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.663
Are you talking
about Eyepatch Willy

05:15.706 --> 05:17.317
or Peg Leg Kenny?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.101
The guy with the
hook for a hand.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.407
Oh.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.582
That's just Steve.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.455
Actually, Grover,
what you're looking at

05:25.499 --> 05:27.544
is one of the wild parrots
of Pasadena.

05:28.763 --> 05:29.894
Yeah, they came here

05:29.938 --> 05:31.722
from South America
when Pablo Escobar

05:31.766 --> 05:35.378
tried to use them to smuggle
drugs into the country.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.381
Seriously?

05:38.425 --> 05:40.470
Yeah. He stopped
when he realized

05:40.514 --> 05:43.212
they could testify against him.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.477
That's ridiculous, Pop.

05:47.521 --> 05:50.524
Uh, they escaped from an exotic
bird trader back in the '60s.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.962
Boy, you believe
everything you read.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.532
Can we keep it as a pet?

05:58.575 --> 06:01.056
No, sweetie. It's a wild animal.

06:01.099 --> 06:04.276
With possible gang ties.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.278
Look, don't worry.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.671
We'll take care of this.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.631
But, uh, you and Grover
should probably go outside

06:10.674 --> 06:12.502
and look at the meteors
with Marty.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.112
Calvin, it's my house.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.418
I should stay and help.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.637
Okay.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.421
I'm gonna need
some hedge clippers,

06:18.465 --> 06:21.903
a nail gun and a mop
you don't mind throwing away.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.603
It's a nice night.
Let's go outside.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.782
Well, these are
pretty good seats.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.176
Yeah. I would have gotten us
tickets on the floor,

06:34.219 --> 06:37.048
but last time
Calvin booed so loud,

06:37.092 --> 06:39.486
the drummer threw
his sticks at us.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.708
Come on, now. You ain't
got time for that.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.058
I know, right?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.451
Hey, you know what?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.322
Watch out for security. I
snuck a little something

06:50.366 --> 06:52.324
into the concert to get
this party started.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.197
Whoa, Dave. So you bought
a little somethin' somethin'?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.242
Hell, yeah, I got a little
somethin' somethin'.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.203
Ah, that little
somethin' somethin'

07:01.246 --> 07:02.596
is a beach ball.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.685
Oh, uh, excuse me.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.121
Is this your
wife's jacket?Whoa!

07:06.164 --> 07:08.297
Whoa.
We're not married.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.125
No. We're just friends.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.432
Us? Married?

07:12.475 --> 07:14.564
Uh, no, no.
Uh, no, no, no, no.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.568
I think he gets it, Tina.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.962
I mean,
can you believe that?

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
Thinking that we're
a couple?

07:23.660 --> 07:25.401
Why is...?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.881
Oh, is it because I'm white?

07:26.924 --> 07:28.448
Oh, no.
Been there, done that.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.973
Well, then, is it because
of the age difference?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.628
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't go there, Dave.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.457
Well, then, what is it?

07:37.500 --> 07:40.677
Well, no offense,
Dave, but you and I,

07:40.721 --> 07:43.027
we're two different types
of people, you know?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.681
I mean, I'm a lot.

07:45.508 --> 07:49.512
Well, I'm quite
a bit, myself.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.036
Sure. Sure.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.603
You are.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.518
Oh, I get it.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.260
You don't think that
I'm as cool as you.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.524
Uh, Dave,
it's not your fault.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.744
Nobody is.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.486
Okay. You know what?

08:06.529 --> 08:07.704
Let's go.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.489
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where are we going?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.360
We're gonna sneak down to
the floor like you wanted.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.580
Oh, come on, Dave.
You know that's not you.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.538
How do you think that
I got to see Phantom

08:15.582 --> 08:17.714
from the ninth row at
the Kalamazoo Playhouse?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.892
Okay. Lead the way.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.938
Great. But stay close.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.984
Much like the Phantom,
I move in the shadows.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.600
Okay, Grover.
You see those streaks of light?

08:33.643 --> 08:36.559
Those are thousands
of space rocks being burnt up

08:36.603 --> 08:38.169
as they enter
Earth's atmosphere.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.607
Wow, that's...

08:40.650 --> 08:43.871
Wait, are you trying to teach me
something on a Saturday?

08:44.959 --> 08:46.438
You'll thank me at homecoming

08:46.482 --> 08:48.179
when they let you set up
the audio equipment.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.009
This reminds me of one of
those silly action movies

08:52.053 --> 08:54.011
where an asteroid's gonna
crash into the planet

08:54.055 --> 08:56.013
and destroy all life on Earth.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.494
Yeah.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.582
But that's really gonna happen.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.585
What?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
Well, yeah,
it-it's simple math, Gemma.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.633
Given the sheer number
of asteroids out there,

09:06.676 --> 09:08.504
one of them is eventually
gonna make impact,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.724
and when that happens,
it's all over.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.597
You mean we're all gonna die?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.556
Well, no, sweetie.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.383
Of course not. Right, Marty?

09:18.427 --> 09:20.951
She's right. It'll only kill
people near the impact zone.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.692
The rest of us
will cling to life

09:22.736 --> 09:24.128
in a nightmarish hellscape.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.568
Grover, why don't you go into
the Butlers' and watch TV.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.309
But I want to hear...Stop learning science
and go watch cartoons.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.098
So...

09:37.141 --> 09:39.100
You want to take
a peek-a-roonie?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.931
Didn't find
the hedge clippers,

09:43.974 --> 09:46.977
but I did find
this weird-ass butterfly net.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.763
Yeah, Pop,

09:49.806 --> 09:51.373
that's a lacrosse stick.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.722
Lacrosse?

09:52.766 --> 09:54.158
That's a tough sport.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.117
I didn't know
Dave had it in him.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.381
Oh. Says "Gemma" on it.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.384
Wait, so,

10:02.427 --> 10:04.734
your plan is to catch the bird
in that tiny net?

10:04.778 --> 10:07.084
And scare the poor little guy?

10:07.128 --> 10:09.130
No.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.740
I'm gonna smash it.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.786
Oh, no, Pop. Wait.

10:12.829 --> 10:16.311
How about instead of solving
the problem like a caveman,

10:16.354 --> 10:17.660
we use our brains.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.141
Oh, so now I don't
use my brain?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.099
Well, you are the one
who accused this parrot

10:22.143 --> 10:23.274
of being a drug mule.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.627
And can you prove
that he's not?

10:28.671 --> 10:30.804
Why don't you just sit down

10:30.847 --> 10:32.153
and let me handle this.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.937
Oh, okay.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.809
Caveman watch.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.161
All right, come on, bird.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.466
Come on.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.207
Get on outta here!

10:43.251 --> 10:45.775
Oh.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.648
Well, you got a job now.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.606
Maybe you should just
pay him to leave.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.566
Come on, let's
go, parrot.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.481
Come on. Ca-caw!

10:56.525 --> 10:58.658
Ca-caw!

10:58.701 --> 11:01.835
Give it up, son, you're making
a fool of yourself.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.750
Come on, parrot.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.668
Yeah!

11:08.711 --> 11:10.713
Look at that.
Who's the fool now?

11:13.847 --> 11:15.979
Still you.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.424
Pop, you've been
chasing this bird

11:26.468 --> 11:28.383
around the living room
for half an hour.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.690
It's called
"stalking your prey."

11:32.126 --> 11:34.302
It's something
meat lovers understand.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.741
Yeah, now I'm starting
to see your plan.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.917
You're waiting for it
to die of old age.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.057
Damn it!

11:50.100 --> 11:52.624
Who puts a lamp on an end table?

11:54.235 --> 11:56.541
Yeah, well, I guess the
bird heard your plan.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.806
Or somebody told it to him.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.722
Oh, just admit it, Pop.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.332
Your idea was even
dumber than mine.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.247
Says who?Says the lamp.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.772
You see a broken lamp,

12:09.816 --> 12:12.514
I see one less place
for the bird to land.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.735
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.258
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.086
Told you I'd get us
down here.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.827
I cannot believe
that security guard

12:20.870 --> 12:23.917
really believed that you were
Tom Cruise's stunt double.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.223
I just told him I got this scar
jumping out of a plane

12:26.267 --> 12:29.226
in Mission: Impossible 5.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.880
Well, how did
you really get it?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.055
Surgery.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.448
I got the hiccups
in seventh grade

12:33.491 --> 12:34.841
and I swallowed
my retainer.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.496
You know, I didn't think
you could pull it off,

12:38.540 --> 12:40.281
but you really did it;
you got us down here.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.804
That was pretty gangsta.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.066
If you thought
that was gangsta,

12:43.110 --> 12:45.286
wait till I blow
this bad boy up.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.076
It's a jumbo,
it might take a minute.

12:55.862 --> 12:59.474
I can't believe you told Grover
the world's gonna end.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.956
You know, this is why people
hate scientists.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.827
That's kind of
an alarming thing to hear

13:04.871 --> 13:06.307
coming from a school principal.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.834
You can't say those kinds
of things in front of kids.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.968
I don't want Grover freaking out
about the end of the world.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.665
Well, I'm sorry, Gemma,
but I'm a scientist;

13:16.708 --> 13:17.840
I work with the facts.

13:17.884 --> 13:21.626
And I'm a parent, Marty; I lie.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.889
Okay. So what are you saying?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.586
We should just
sugarcoat the truth

13:24.629 --> 13:26.849
and stuff him full
of ignorance and falsehoods?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.808
Yes.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.159
He's seven years old.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.770
He doesn't need to know
the world's a scary place.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.946
All he should be thinking
about are comic books,

13:36.990 --> 13:39.557
playing with his toys
and collecting Pokémon.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.646
You know, I thought about
all three of those today.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.955
Look, I know
it can't last forever,

13:45.999 --> 13:49.350
but he only gets to be innocent
for a little while.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.134
Okay, I get it.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.484
And if it makes you feel better,
the whole asteroid thing

13:53.528 --> 13:55.835
probably won't happen
for another 10,000 years.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.575
Well, that's a relief.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.664
Or Wednesday.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.855
That bird is taunting
us, I know it.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.379
Yeah. He's feeling himself
more than you.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.903
Maybe he got a job

14:20.947 --> 14:23.645
and bought his family
some sunflower seeds.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.868
I don't know why I thought
things would be any different.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.913
What are you
talking about?

14:30.957 --> 14:33.176
You've been riding me for years
about getting a job.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.830
Now I finally got one

14:34.874 --> 14:37.093
and I still can't get
the respect I deserve.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.880
Look, you're a grown-ass man
who finally got a job.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.535
But unless that job is making
trophies, don't expect one.

14:44.579 --> 14:47.103
I don't want
a trophy, Pop,

14:47.147 --> 14:49.149
I just want to be
treated like an equal.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.715
Equal?

14:50.759 --> 14:52.804
To who?

14:55.677 --> 14:56.852
Equal to you.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.593
Okay. Look.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.812
Now, I'm glad that
you're getting a paycheck,

15:00.856 --> 15:03.946
but the truth is, son,
we'll never be equals.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.949
So, what, you're always
gonna be better than me?

15:06.993 --> 15:10.039
No, son,
I'm not better than you,

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
but I am your father,

15:12.085 --> 15:14.914
which means I'm further
down the road than you.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.918
And it's my responsibility
to guide and teach you,

15:18.961 --> 15:22.051
which means
if you say something stupid,

15:22.095 --> 15:23.966
I'm gonna tell you it's stupid.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.927
Now, if you say something smart,

15:27.970 --> 15:29.798
I'm gonna take credit for it.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.628
Right. So nobody gets
to tell you

15:33.671 --> 15:34.846
when you say something stupid?

15:34.890 --> 15:36.065
Are you kidding me?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.719
I got your mother for that.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.115
All right, man,
so should we just

15:42.158 --> 15:43.943
go tell Gemma that
this bird beat us?

15:43.986 --> 15:45.248
Yeah, I guess so.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.469
Oh.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.995
Don't move, Pop.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.736
W-W-What should I do?

15:54.779 --> 15:56.042
Oh, now you want my advice?

15:58.566 --> 16:00.481
Don't play with me, Malcolm.
Get-get out the way.Okay.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.051
Okay, little bird.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.140
Don't do nothing crazy.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.360
We both want to get home
to our families.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.455
Ha ha!
You did it!

16:18.499 --> 16:20.370
You see that?

16:20.414 --> 16:22.024
You see how cool
I played it?
Yeah.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.331
Took me back to
my street days, man.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.246
Yeah, Pop, you was ice cold.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.553
Well, now that we
handled our business...

16:29.597 --> 16:31.903
Right. Right.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.036
...what do you say
we go home?Let's go, man.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.219
That's Dave's
problem now.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.572
You and your stupid
beach ball.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.618
I'm the only black girl
at the concert

16:50.661 --> 16:53.055
and you got me doing
a perp walk from the front row.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.363
I don't understand.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.105
The beach ball was
a big hit at Phantom.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.672
You try to sneak down again,
and I'm kicking you out.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.154
Oh, my God.Enjoy the concert.

17:07.113 --> 17:10.029
Man, wasn't that guy's
first beach ball.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.683
He cut it right
on the seam.
Okay.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.121
Look, Dave, just put down
the beach ball, okay?

17:15.164 --> 17:17.079
No, I'm not letting this
guy ruin our night.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
I'm getting out
my patch kit.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.304
Enough!

17:24.347 --> 17:26.175
He's not ruining
the concert.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.700
You are ruining the concert
for trying to be so cool.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.225
Trying? If I wasn't so
cool, how do you think

17:32.268 --> 17:33.965
I got us down to the floor
in the first place?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.097
You want to know the truth?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.707
I gave him 50 bucks.

17:36.751 --> 17:40.102
Everybody knows that Tom Cruise
does his own stunts!

17:44.324 --> 17:46.761
All right, you know what?
I have another plan.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.197
No, no! No, please.
Please, Dave,

17:48.241 --> 17:49.503
no more plans, okay?

17:49.546 --> 17:52.810
Let's just sit here,
watch the concert,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.203
and go home.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.162
All right. Fine.

17:58.207 --> 18:01.123
Well, don't just sit there.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.298
Well, that's what
you told me to do.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.647
Well, you're doing it
all weird.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.171
I-- You know...

18:05.214 --> 18:06.520
I can't win with you.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.610
All I wanted for us was
to make a connection.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.090
You know, obviously,
not as deep

18:11.133 --> 18:13.222
as the one that I have
with Calvin, but still...

18:13.266 --> 18:15.529
Dave, what are you
talking about?

18:15.572 --> 18:18.140
We do have a connection.We do?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.533
Of course.
If we didn't,

18:19.576 --> 18:21.187
I wouldn't have come here
in the first place.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.797
Ain't nobody
got no time for that.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.281
Dave, I like you.

18:28.324 --> 18:32.285
You and your corny jokes
and your goofy hobbies.

18:32.328 --> 18:35.070
And I like that no matter
how much Calvin makes fun

18:35.114 --> 18:36.289
of your little short
little running shorts,

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
you just keep wearing them.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.337
You know, sometimes I
wear even shorter ones

18:41.381 --> 18:42.599
just to mess with him.

18:44.732 --> 18:45.907
You see?

18:45.950 --> 18:48.344
You own who you are,
like I do.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.737
You feel me?

18:49.780 --> 18:52.348
Yeah, I feel ya.

18:53.915 --> 18:57.962
So what you're saying is
you got time for this.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.747
All day, boo.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.142
Ooh.
All right!

19:03.185 --> 19:05.187
Yeah. Here we go!

19:05.231 --> 19:07.276
You know, Gemma
told me not to,

19:07.320 --> 19:09.017
but I snuck
something else in.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.193
What?
My air guitar.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.239
Oh.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.764
Well, last concert,
Calvin broke mine.

19:16.807 --> 19:19.027
But I still got
my air drums!

19:19.070 --> 19:20.246
Yeah, ya do.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.472
So is the asteroid
gonna kill us

19:29.516 --> 19:31.170
or do I have to
do my homework?

19:34.129 --> 19:35.174
Uh, no, actually,

19:35.217 --> 19:37.045
I just got a call
from NASA,

19:37.088 --> 19:39.308
and they said they
invented a giant laser gun

19:39.352 --> 19:41.267
that's gonna blow it
right out of the sky.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.659
That's great news.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.095
Right, Grover?

19:44.139 --> 19:45.140
Maybe for you.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.489
Now I have to
write a paragraph

19:46.533 --> 19:48.622
about the American flag.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.321
Thank you.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.453
It's no problem.

19:53.496 --> 19:54.889
Lying to kids is kind of fun.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.153
Dave's been trying
to get that bird

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
out of y'all's house
for a long time.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.983
Well, it's a pretty
smart bird, Mama.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.943
And very aggressive.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.206
It broke your lamp.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.123
Oh, look.
Dave's door is opening.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.604
Oh.
I gotta see this.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.223
Good talk, little guy.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.313
Go be free.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.231
See that, Calvin?

20:32.274 --> 20:35.016
Just got to play it cool.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.410
Well, you should've closed
your door, 'cause all

20:37.453 --> 20:40.587
he's gonna do is fly
right back into your...

20:40.630 --> 20:42.589
MALCOLM:
Help! Help!

20:46.157 --> 20:47.376
Thank you!

20:47.420 --> 20:48.725
And good night.♪
