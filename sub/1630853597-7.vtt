WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.742
[Raelle]
Previously, onMotherland...

00:03.786 --> 00:04.743
[Willa]
To get Raelle, I need

00:04.787 --> 00:06.528
to tap into the Mycelium.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.920
[Edwin] Raelle has
a whole new life now.

00:07.964 --> 00:09.357
We need to let her live it.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.749
Please, Willa.
Send her back to me.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.621
[Tally]
I saw a vision where Raelle

00:12.664 --> 00:15.015
released a Witchbomb
that was destroying the world.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.755
[Alder]
We haven't much time

00:16.799 --> 00:18.235
to find the pieces
of the First Song

00:18.279 --> 00:19.715
whose music
will heal the world.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.977
Two pieces remain.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.761
Any idea who tipped off
the Camarilla?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.459
It had to have been
a member of the Council.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.330
The Cession Council
had the fugitives

00:26.374 --> 00:29.029
and didn't extradite,
a clear violation of the treaty.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.682
[Silver]
The United States military,

00:30.726 --> 00:32.162
along with an elite
civilian force,

00:32.206 --> 00:34.730
are preparing to invade
and occupy the Cession.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.123
You built a militia?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.385
[Thelma] I knew
this day would be coming.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.777
I took precautions.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.518
We have an invasion
to prepare for.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.780
You and the others
are welcome to stay.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.956
But you're going to need
to choose right now.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.366
[gasps]

01:08.633 --> 01:10.548
-Rae.
-[gasps]

01:21.733 --> 01:24.736
Why did you bring me here?

01:24.780 --> 01:26.564
We used to do this
every Sunday,

01:26.608 --> 01:28.262
when I was home. Remember?

01:28.305 --> 01:31.003
[bird chirping]

01:31.047 --> 01:34.833
It's me. It's Mom. I swear.

01:34.877 --> 01:38.446
How can I know for sure?

01:38.489 --> 01:41.318
Because I'll shoot
straight with you.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.755
You're healed, Rae.

01:43.799 --> 01:48.064
Enough so we can
be out here or...

01:48.108 --> 01:50.066
Well, then, I can leave.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.634
If you want to.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.766
It's your choice.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.117
Stay, and we can be together.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.336
We can have
our Sundays again.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.512
Every day in-between.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.693
And if I go?

02:08.737 --> 02:11.000
If something happens to you,

02:11.043 --> 02:13.742
the Mother won't be able
to bring you back anymore.

02:13.785 --> 02:17.180
And that world above is
even worse than you left it.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.575
More hate. More death.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.752
I know.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.363
That's why I need
to go back, Mom.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.712
I need to help.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.714
Yeah.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.674
I know you do, baby.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.502
I also know that isn't
the only reason

02:34.545 --> 02:36.765
you need to get back.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.811
Come on. She's waited
long enough.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.732
[sighs]

02:49.647 --> 02:52.476
-[sniffles]
-Goodbye, Mom.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.698
[sighs]

02:56.741 --> 02:58.395
I love you.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.270
[sniffles] I love you, too.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.793
[sniffling]

03:09.754 --> 03:14.150
You should know, the Mother
will call on you at the end.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.674
What do you mean?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.811
Mom, what do you mean?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.813
[echoing] Mom!

03:25.857 --> 03:28.120
[echoing] Mom!

03:28.164 --> 03:30.166
[theme playing]

04:32.054 --> 04:33.577
[Thelma] It'd be foolish
to go looking

04:33.621 --> 04:35.144
for the Marshal now.
I've got reports.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.320
of U.S. troop convoys
moving fast toward our borders.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.756
There's still time. Please,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.237
just point us
in the right direction.

04:44.153 --> 04:48.984
All the Marshals are connected.
They share a mental link.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.116
We saw that when
they were chasing us.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.770
Like Alder with the Biddies.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.685
Similar, but I wouldn't

04:54.729 --> 04:56.948
call them "Biddies"
to their faces.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.299
So we find one of them,
he could lead us

04:59.342 --> 05:00.387
to where Wade's hidden.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.693
If you can
convince him to talk.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.001
The Iroquois Territory
Marshal is stationed

05:06.044 --> 05:08.395
at a border crossing
east of here.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.440
You better hurry.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.137
You're not coming with us?

05:12.181 --> 05:14.226
No. The Council's called
an emergency meeting.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.838
You think they might decide
to turn us over, after all?

05:16.881 --> 05:18.753
I won't let it come to that.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.450
But they still don't know
about the militia yet,

05:20.494 --> 05:22.887
and... I'm not sure
how they're gonna react

05:22.931 --> 05:24.193
when I tell them.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.980
There's one other thing.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.767
There have been some...
complaints again.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.770
About the smell.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.032
We'll talk to her.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.034
[knocking on door]

05:39.077 --> 05:40.688
[door opens]

05:45.649 --> 05:47.564
Nice menagerie you've
got going here.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.740
No matter how hard I try,
there's nothing but silence.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.568
You've done
everything you can.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.830
You even pulled Willa
back from the dead.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.963
Just... have some faith.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.661
I just need to tweak
the Working the right way.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.751
Listen, Ramshorn,
you miss her.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.754
So do I, OK, we all
want her back.

06:03.798 --> 06:04.973
But we need to make sure
Raelle still has

06:05.016 --> 06:07.802
a world to come back to.

06:07.845 --> 06:11.762
Um, yeah. You should all go,
and I'll stay and keep trying.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.895
No. You're a part
of the Unit now,

06:13.938 --> 06:15.766
and we need your help.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.812
-But what if--
-Raelle will find you.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.771
And until then, she'd want you
fighting alongside us.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.907
[sighs]

06:25.950 --> 06:28.562
What do you want me to do?

06:28.605 --> 06:31.173
[indistinct chatter]

06:31.216 --> 06:34.742
Thelma, my girl!
Ooh, you look famished!

06:34.785 --> 06:38.049
Here - have some of my
world-famous Wasna.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.660
You sure this place
is secure?

06:39.703 --> 06:42.140
Of course, it is.
My community center

06:42.184 --> 06:43.881
is a sanctioned meeting place.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.666
Yeah, so was the hotel.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.756
Aw, it's scary times,
I admit, but, uh,

06:48.799 --> 06:52.368
we must not be afraid,
cousin. Mm?

06:55.893 --> 06:58.418
Oh, shall we start?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.465
There's something I need
to say before we start.

07:06.164 --> 07:10.386
Fellow councilmembers,
I admit,

07:10.430 --> 07:11.996
I always thought
this day would come.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.607
We were never
going to be safe.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.739
Not while
our peoples prospered,

07:15.783 --> 07:19.787
shining in the face
of the nation that put us here.

07:19.830 --> 07:23.530
And now, with the false charges
against a Bellweather Unit,

07:23.573 --> 07:25.662
they found
the excuse they needed.

07:27.708 --> 07:33.061
So, over the past year,
I have been building a militia -

07:33.104 --> 07:35.759
growing numbers,
training, planning.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.587
I know some of you
will be angry--

07:37.631 --> 07:41.199
Angry! You went behind
all our backs with this.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.201
You want a war, is that it?

07:43.245 --> 07:45.726
What I want is to avoid
having our lands

07:45.769 --> 07:47.728
taken from us again!

07:47.771 --> 07:50.731
Please, we need
to calm down, Thelma.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.210
You should've told us sooner,

07:52.254 --> 07:54.909
but we're willing
to hear you out.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.780
Thank you.

08:07.704 --> 08:08.749
Why are we going off-route?

08:11.142 --> 08:13.754
Hey! Where are you taking me?

08:13.797 --> 08:15.799
[bird cawing]

08:40.476 --> 08:42.522
[indistinct chatter]

08:44.088 --> 08:46.090
-Mac?
-[Mac] She's all right.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.701
Just keep her away
from rooftops.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.747
What are you doing here?

08:50.791 --> 08:53.620
Same reason as you.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.751
'Cause she brought us.

08:54.795 --> 08:58.625
-[bird caws]
-Good work.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.496
Hope you had
a good time back home.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
We have a little
catching up to do.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.598
[indistinct chatter]

09:16.773 --> 09:19.210
You two stay here,
out of sight.

09:33.224 --> 09:37.185
I can feel it.
That fear in the air.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.449
People won't be getting
much sleep in the days to come.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.930
Unless we find Wade
and end this now.

09:44.801 --> 09:47.804
I'm sorry this militia began
without your knowledge,

09:47.848 --> 09:51.678
but I beg you, don't let anger
cloud your judgment.

09:51.721 --> 09:55.290
Support me now.
Support my army.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.685
And together, we can
fight back as one.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.469
For the land
of the Great River.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.471
For each other.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.518
[bodies, plates falling]

10:07.911 --> 10:10.305
[gasps]

10:10.348 --> 10:11.741
Shit.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.786
[exclaims]

10:18.922 --> 10:21.055
Adil, Abigail.
This is the Marshal

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
for the Iroquoian Territory.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.146
I understand you want me
to contact the Head Marshal.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.365
Yes. Can you
help us find him?

10:27.409 --> 10:30.586
He's been hard to reach
lately. Very secretive.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.284
But our link spans
the length of the Cession.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.677
Unless he's
outside our borders,

10:34.721 --> 10:36.679
I should be able
to locate him.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.724
Give me a moment.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.426
[Abigail]
That's one of our convoys.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.167
You sure the wards will hold?

10:46.210 --> 10:48.299
Only the Council
can disengage the wards.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.171
They'll hold. I need
to get back out there.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.738
Contacting the Marshal
will have to wait.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.348
Understood.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.265
[whirring]

10:59.571 --> 11:01.008
Sir, the wards!

11:01.051 --> 11:02.792
Maintain your positions!

11:29.471 --> 11:31.429
[Anacostia] We need
to stay calm and out of sight.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.822
The Marshal will handle it.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.401
[Marshal] Bringing a
militarized force onto our land

11:46.444 --> 11:49.317
is a direct violation
of the U.S. Cession Treaty.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.319
I don't need to be
lectured on the treaty.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.625
You were the ones
that broke it when you refused

11:53.669 --> 11:55.410
to turn over
the Bellweather Unit.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.542
Please take
your troops and go.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.286
The wards went down
at the exact perfect moment.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.418
[Adil]
I thought only the Council

12:03.461 --> 12:04.767
could deactivate them.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.769
Someone must be helping
from the inside.

12:07.944 --> 12:11.513
[groans, sighing]

12:16.779 --> 12:19.869
No. Milly.

12:19.913 --> 12:24.569
Oh, I am sorry, cousin.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.529
If only you'd had
some of my home cookin'.

12:27.572 --> 12:28.835
-Oh, God.
-You wouldn't have

12:28.878 --> 12:30.750
such a headache.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.795
You don't have to do this.

12:32.839 --> 12:36.146
Mm, they came to me
and asked if I would help them.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.801
They knew all about
how my territory

12:38.845 --> 12:41.717
was kept out of
the big mining contracts,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.850
how we had no good land
on the water,

12:43.893 --> 12:48.768
all the issues I'd brought
to the Council year after year.

12:48.811 --> 12:52.989
But, uh, unlike the Council,
they were ready to help.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.472
Milly. What did you do?

12:57.515 --> 13:00.431
What I had to.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.912
They just want to get
those damn girls,

13:02.956 --> 13:04.958
and then, they'll be
on their way.

13:05.001 --> 13:09.397
Ah, this will just be
a quick in-and-out for them.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.748
The wards. You can't--

13:12.792 --> 13:14.750
They're already down,
Bearkiller.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.797
Don't worry.
I'm no more interested

13:17.840 --> 13:19.929
in being re-colonized
than you are.

13:19.973 --> 13:24.978
[scoffs] You think
they'll just leave?

13:25.021 --> 13:28.720
Milly. Have you learned
nothing from history?

13:28.764 --> 13:31.767
The treaty is broken.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.336
And we're all
vulnerable now, even you.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.126
[indistinct chatter]

13:49.829 --> 13:51.787
We've put the word out
about your Marshal,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.921
though you know we prefer
to stay away from the law.

13:54.964 --> 13:58.489
Thank you, Mac,
for everything.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.795
I wasn't sure
you'd even show up.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.276
Oh, I was angry
about what went down.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.974
But then, something
funny happened.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.715
You realized you were
actually happier

14:06.758 --> 14:08.325
not shipping paper all day?

14:08.369 --> 14:11.720
Hm. That, and when
we got desperate,

14:11.763 --> 14:13.417
the Cession took us in.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.897
Our fellow witches
keep up safe, and--

14:14.941 --> 14:17.378
and all that anger went away.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.774
Safe. It's hard
to use that word these days.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.385
I hope there's
something we can do to--

14:24.428 --> 14:26.735
to repay the kindness
that the Cession has shown us.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.737
We're happy to help.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.783
[gasps, exhales]

14:35.265 --> 14:36.745
-Did you find Wade?
-I didn't see anything

14:36.788 --> 14:38.138
about Wade
in the coming days,

14:38.181 --> 14:40.314
but I think the Council
is in danger.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.229
We should regroup
with Abigail.

14:42.272 --> 14:46.450
Not enough time. What I saw,
I think we can save them.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.626
Just you and me,
saving the day.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.672
One battle at a time.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.589
And we won't be alone.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.814
[ambient street noise]

15:18.787 --> 15:20.832
[speaking Spanish]

15:24.967 --> 15:27.796
Just so you know,
we close in 10 minutes.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.537
-[door locks]
-But feel free to peruse.

15:31.147 --> 15:35.804
Hello? Is there
something I can help you with?

15:47.468 --> 15:49.339
Lucky me.

15:51.689 --> 15:55.737
To have such a woman

15:55.780 --> 15:58.566
grace my store
with her beauty.

15:58.609 --> 16:02.135
Mm. I'm looking
for a man named Santos.

16:02.178 --> 16:05.355
[chuckles] I am Santos.

16:05.399 --> 16:09.316
Good. I need your help
locating an artifact.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.840
I heard you have quite
the private collection.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.584
Right this way, please.

16:16.627 --> 16:19.804
Let's go have
a look, shall we?

16:37.170 --> 16:41.174
Couldn't even track down
a couple of rogue witches.

16:41.217 --> 16:44.220
You people are pathetic.
Which is why

16:44.264 --> 16:46.788
our peacekeeping force
is gonna scour every inch

16:46.831 --> 16:49.399
of the Cession
until they're apprehended.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.835
Now, step aside.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.318
[Marshal] Under
the authority of the Council

16:55.362 --> 16:59.061
of the Great River,
I demand that you leave, now!

16:59.105 --> 17:00.715
-[laughs menacingly]
-All of you!

17:00.758 --> 17:02.673
I don't recognize
any authority other than

17:02.717 --> 17:04.719
the President
of these United States,

17:04.762 --> 17:07.722
and the president himself
sent us.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.811
We are coming in.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.730
[grunting]

17:15.773 --> 17:18.602
[whistling]

17:18.646 --> 17:21.692
[supernatural growl]

17:23.042 --> 17:24.869
[gasps] What just happened?

17:24.913 --> 17:27.785
His armor.
Must be the same tech

17:27.829 --> 17:29.613
from the cage
Hearst kept me in.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.660
OK, so no direct work.
We can take him.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.445
Stand down. The Marshal's OK.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.056
If we go out there,
there will be bloodshed.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.448
Well, we can't just
sit here any longer.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.233
I won't tell you again.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.886
Stand down.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.199
[Anderson]
You should've let us in

17:50.243 --> 17:51.809
when you had the chance.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.726
-[groans]
-[all gasp]

17:55.770 --> 17:57.250
[groans]

17:59.774 --> 18:01.123
[gasps]

18:01.167 --> 18:03.256
We will encounter
hostile witches

18:03.299 --> 18:05.693
like this one on our mission.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.435
That is how you
neutralize the threat.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.827
Arrest them.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.743
[Cadet #1]
Up against the wall.

18:12.787 --> 18:13.701
[Cadet #2]
Come on, let's go.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.269
[indistinct chatter]

18:16.312 --> 18:17.748
We need to do something.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.533
No, no. Listen to me.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
You know as well as I do,
those people

18:21.187 --> 18:22.840
don't care who they kill.
And if we go out there,

18:22.884 --> 18:24.668
more people will die,
including some witches

18:24.712 --> 18:27.889
who aren't here by choice.
We stick to the mission.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.500
And leave the Marshal's blood
drying on the ground?

18:30.544 --> 18:32.546
-And what about those guards?
-Our orders are clear.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.113
Find Wade, get back
to Fort Salem.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.245
Some soldiers are heroes
because of how bravely

18:36.289 --> 18:38.421
they follow orders.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.162
I am not one
of those soldiers.

18:40.206 --> 18:44.210
Your mother was clear.
Avoid bloodshed on both sides.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.777
My mother will understand.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.824
Or she won't, but this
is what I have to do.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.526
OK. Good luck, soldier.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.012
[goose honking]

19:10.279 --> 19:12.455
[exhales deeply]

19:12.499 --> 19:14.370
Everyone's in position,
ready to move.

19:14.414 --> 19:18.635
Not yet. The guards
are changing shift soon.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.681
I'll take
two of them at once.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.813
Just say the word.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.602
I wonder if you'd
had your Sight,

19:28.645 --> 19:31.170
back when you turned me
in for being Spree and all,

19:31.213 --> 19:34.782
and you'd see us here today,
working together,

19:34.825 --> 19:36.566
would you have believed it?

19:36.610 --> 19:39.134
Probably not.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.659
I mean, I was pretty sure
that if I ever saw you again,

19:42.703 --> 19:45.793
you'd murder me.
Or vice versa.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.187
You did what you did
out of love for Raelle.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.711
Your love was brave,
it was fearless.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.800
Mine was selfish.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.628
Not anymore, it's not.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.764
I saw a vision of Raelle.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.941
She was...
It's difficult to explain.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.856
But was she OK?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.381
She was destroying the world
with the Witchbomb.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.427
I don't know when or why,
but I know it's coming.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.212
Well, could you tap into
the vision again?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.476
[panting]

20:20.828 --> 20:24.614
Hey. All I know is that

20:24.658 --> 20:26.877
once we have her back,
we'll find a way

20:26.921 --> 20:28.575
to stop it from happening.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.054
We have to.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.407
[both sigh]

20:36.800 --> 20:38.149
It's time.

20:42.980 --> 20:47.768
So, are we looking
for something in particular?

20:47.811 --> 20:51.032
Ah! I have
an excellent assortment

20:51.075 --> 20:54.122
of early
ecclesiastical volumes.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.081
You can stop
pretending now, Santos.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.779
I know who you are.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.085
[chuckles]
Whatever do you mean?

21:03.087 --> 21:06.134
You were the Pontifex
for decades for the Camarilla.

21:06.177 --> 21:09.572
Historian. Keeper of secrets.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.752
You are descended from
a long line of witch hunters.

21:15.796 --> 21:19.539
That was another life,
General Alder.

21:19.582 --> 21:23.760
That was this life, Santos.
Not so many years ago.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.936
I've left that all behind.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.765
Started my little store.
That's always been my dream.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.768
I'm not interested
in your dreams.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.380
I want information.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.077
I am not on
their side anymore.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.384
Ask anything of me.

21:38.427 --> 21:42.388
The First Song.
All that you know.

21:42.431 --> 21:47.567
My. Going straight
for the top, I see.

21:54.922 --> 21:58.142
I was born into
the Camarilla, you know.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.667
Never had a choice.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.758
But... I enjoy collecting.

22:04.801 --> 22:07.761
It was my favorite
part of the job.

22:07.804 --> 22:10.764
And now, I just want
to live out

22:10.807 --> 22:14.202
the last years
of my life in peace.

22:14.245 --> 22:18.249
Leave all that violence
in the past.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.691
[Anderson]
Invasion Force, move in!

22:50.804 --> 22:52.414
[tires squeal]

22:55.939 --> 22:57.941
[deep vocalizing]

23:22.052 --> 23:27.754
Well, if it isn't Bellweather's
little Tarim plaything.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.279
Wind strike, on my command!

23:31.322 --> 23:33.455
Ready... and...

23:33.499 --> 23:34.804
[crack]

23:56.826 --> 24:00.003
Officer Cadet Bellweather...

24:00.047 --> 24:01.614
I think you should run.

24:01.657 --> 24:02.919
You sure about that?

24:02.963 --> 24:03.920
They have troops of their own

24:03.964 --> 24:05.356
moving up behind us.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.098
We'll cover for you.
As long as we can.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.796
Then you'll let the guards go?

24:11.406 --> 24:12.712
Release them!

24:14.801 --> 24:16.150
[Abigail]
What's your name, soldier?

24:16.193 --> 24:19.545
Officer Cadet
Guadalupe Cortez.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.720
Call me "Lupe."

24:36.692 --> 24:39.913
I know you're scared.
I know it's too soon.

24:39.956 --> 24:43.220
It's always too soon.
And what's ahead

24:43.264 --> 24:47.311
will be difficult.
But you must

24:47.355 --> 24:50.750
protect the innocent
at any cost.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.883
That is our greatest calling.
It always has been.

24:55.755 --> 24:59.759
Never forget who you are
and whose army you fight for.

24:59.802 --> 25:03.806
Employ every bit of Work
you have to complicate,

25:03.850 --> 25:07.810
obfuscate, subvert, and
undermine Jarrett's objectives

25:07.854 --> 25:12.032
while maintaining the semblance
of following orders.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.208
Is that clear, soldiers?

25:15.992 --> 25:18.429
Good.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.823
You are General
Petra Bellweather's soldiers.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.912
Make her proud.

25:35.490 --> 25:39.059
I guarantee the Council
will be treated well.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.756
You'll go with the soldiers
when they get here

25:40.800 --> 25:43.542
for safekeeping
until this is over.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.765
[hisses]

25:49.809 --> 25:51.419
Stay inside, Miss Longhorse!

25:51.462 --> 25:52.768
-[witches hissing]
-Looks like you didn't

25:52.812 --> 25:54.596
think this one through, Milly.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.946
-[hissing]
-[grunts]

25:58.818 --> 26:00.994
Guess this makes us even now?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.822
Milly put something
in the Wasna.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.476
We have to get the Council
to safety, then find her.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.608
U.S. forces on the way.

26:06.652 --> 26:11.439
[vocalizing]

26:11.482 --> 26:13.267
I can wake them.
But I'm gonna need a minute.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.486
A minute is all we need.
Get to the back door.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.966
-Trust me!
-[vocalizing]

26:17.010 --> 26:20.187
[panting]

26:20.230 --> 26:21.275
Oh!

26:22.972 --> 26:26.585
Keep going, Miss Longhorse.
You're almost there.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.631
[gasps]

26:29.675 --> 26:31.024
Sometimes, you eat
the bear, Milly.

26:31.067 --> 26:34.288
Sometimes, the bear
eats you. [chuckles]

26:34.331 --> 26:35.811
[panting]

26:38.118 --> 26:40.686
During the Inquisition,
we were able to gather

26:40.729 --> 26:43.776
quite a bit of information
on these stewards.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.778
Ah! Here it is.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.823
The two lines
you're looking for.

26:50.739 --> 26:52.175
Interesting.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.568
Speak quickly, Santos.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.787
Neither of these two lines

26:54.830 --> 26:57.833
trace to a modern
living steward.

26:57.877 --> 26:59.574
That can't be.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.707
What we call
the Abyssinian Line

27:01.750 --> 27:03.752
has been lost entirely,
it seems.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.754
And the other?

27:05.798 --> 27:10.063
The Barbicarum Line
was snuffed out centuries ago,

27:10.106 --> 27:12.935
before the steward
could pass it down.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.764
There must be another way
to retrieve it.

27:15.808 --> 27:20.813
I'm afraid not. Unless you've
a way to travel back in time.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.821
The box.

27:37.177 --> 27:38.787
[sighs]

27:47.143 --> 27:49.145
[vocalizing]

27:58.633 --> 28:00.591
[recording stops]

28:00.635 --> 28:04.160
That is from
the extinct steward's line.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.990
A souvenir of sorts.
From one of her descendants.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.776
But unfortunately,
the song had never been

28:10.819 --> 28:13.604
passed down to her.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.737
Her vocal cords...

28:15.781 --> 28:19.393
Horrid, I know.
It was an old custom

28:19.436 --> 28:24.093
that, I hate to admit,
I taught my students about.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.096
One of them became enamored
with the possibilities

28:27.140 --> 28:30.056
and has revived it, in a way.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.710
Hearst.

28:33.842 --> 28:38.804
That is all I know about
the First Song, I swear to you.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.852
-[gasping]
-[Santos] Uh-oh.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.333
Oh, my. I--
I forgot about that.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.031
This is fake.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.467
What do you mean?

28:50.511 --> 28:53.079
I was there, remember?

28:53.122 --> 28:57.083
I saw the real one.
Braided leather!

28:58.214 --> 29:01.783
[both grunt]

29:03.785 --> 29:07.789
Please, I beg you.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.749
I'm a fool. A sinful fool.

29:10.792 --> 29:15.928
Dios perdóname!

29:15.971 --> 29:20.976
I'm not the same man I was.
I am different now!

29:22.586 --> 29:24.110
So am I.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.809
[blood dripping]

30:01.974 --> 30:03.714
[indistinct chatter]

30:03.758 --> 30:06.326

We go against them,
