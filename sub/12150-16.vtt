00:01.929 --> 00:03.120
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:06.219
These people were threatened
at their offices...

00:06.730 --> 00:10.800
...by an intruder who was released
right before they were murdered.

00:11.529 --> 00:13.990
- We're not judging you.
- You're firing me.

00:16.929 --> 00:17.870
How do you feel?

00:18.129 --> 00:21.539
- Stronger.
- You're getting stronger every day.

00:22.329 --> 00:23.910
Do you love her?
Is that it?

00:26.050 --> 00:28.719
Wesley doesn't need you.
We don't need you.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.320
- We hoped you'd be in the office.
- Mrs. Sharp.

00:31.649 --> 00:33.899
One of them is on their way here.

00:34.649 --> 00:36.159
- The ring?
- The Band of Blacknil.

00:37.049 --> 00:39.679
The Kleynach use it to move
between dimensions.

00:40.049 --> 00:41.700
Will it get me to the Home Office?

00:42.450 --> 00:45.399
You realize this Home Office
is probably Hell.

00:46.049 --> 00:47.450
Why do you wanna go to Hell?

00:47.850 --> 00:49.950
Welcome to the Home Office.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.859
The world doesn't work in spite
of evil. It works with us.

00:55.649 --> 00:57.020
It works because of us.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.479
What do you want, Darla? This?

01:54.450 --> 01:55.430
Oh, God.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.129
Don't fight it, my love.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.579
Just let it happen.
It'll only hurt for a minute.

03:07.409 --> 03:09.409
Oh, God. Oh, God.

03:10.409 --> 03:13.569
Yes, I know. It was
the same for me.

03:14.610 --> 03:17.349
The soul is gone, but
it leaves a bitterness.

03:18.210 --> 03:19.860
It'll pass.

03:25.409 --> 03:30.189
You need a fresh kill. Hot human blood
will wash away the foul memory of it.

03:31.409 --> 03:32.710
I promise.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.139
What?

03:37.409 --> 03:38.849
What is it?

03:39.810 --> 03:41.460
You saved me.

03:42.810 --> 03:46.289
Yes. But I was going
to kill you tonight.

03:47.009 --> 03:50.060
Take you out of this world
the way I brought you in.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.000
But I didn't have to.

03:53.610 --> 03:56.979
You gave yourself over
so completely, Angelus.

03:59.009 --> 04:00.729
I felt you surrender.

04:08.009 --> 04:10.039
I gave you everything I had left.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.939
Yes.

04:14.009 --> 04:16.110
I'm so sorry.

04:17.610 --> 04:19.149
You don't have to be.

04:22.410 --> 04:23.740
But I am.

04:28.410 --> 04:29.920
I am sorry.

04:33.209 --> 04:35.069
- What?
- I'm sorry, Darla.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.569
- No.
- You saved me.

04:38.610 --> 04:42.230
- Sorry I couldn't do the same.
- Let go of me.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.500
You still have a soul.

04:54.810 --> 04:56.810
- But we....
- Yeah.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.810
And you....

05:00.810 --> 05:02.000
I know.

05:02.610 --> 05:04.930
- Then I....
- Three times.

05:06.810 --> 05:08.740
You're not evil.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.879
I don't understand.
Was I...?

05:12.810 --> 05:15.339
Was it not good?

05:19.410 --> 05:23.170
I don't accept that. You cannot
tell me that wasn't perfect.

05:23.610 --> 05:28.180
I've been around 400 years. I've done
this professionally. That was perfect.

05:29.610 --> 05:31.750
- We'll go again.
- No, no.

05:32.610 --> 05:33.800
We can't.

05:34.410 --> 05:36.089
You know we can't.

05:37.410 --> 05:40.569
- We're finished.
- Finished? Why?

05:41.610 --> 05:43.569
Because you suddenly decide?

05:44.009 --> 05:47.199
An hour ago you wanted this!
You weren't tricked!

05:47.610 --> 05:52.180
- I didn't seduce you! You wanted this!
- Yeah, and it was perfect.

05:54.810 --> 05:57.199
It was perfect despair.

05:59.610 --> 06:03.259
And you were the reason.
You've always been the reason.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.829
You were the thing
that made me what I am.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.040
I thought that
if I could save you...

06:10.410 --> 06:14.379
...I'd somehow save myself,
but I was wrong.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.470
- When I failed--
- Stop it!

06:17.009 --> 06:20.660
When I failed, you saved me.
I have to thank you for that.

06:21.810 --> 06:25.670
There's nothing I can do for you now.
I can't even hate you.

06:26.009 --> 06:29.560
You knew this would happen.
You made me trust you!

06:30.810 --> 06:32.699
You made me believe!

06:35.610 --> 06:38.069
We're done. Let yourself out.

06:39.209 --> 06:41.139
Where are you going?

06:43.410 --> 06:46.569
You did me a favor tonight.
Now I'll do one for you.

06:47.610 --> 06:49.329
Get dressed and get out...

06:50.009 --> 06:53.240
...because next time I see you,
I'll have to kill you.

07:00.209 --> 07:01.579
Kate! Kate!

07:01.850 --> 07:03.779
Kate, open the door! Kate!

07:12.050 --> 07:12.990
Kate.

07:55.410 --> 07:56.490
Thanks.

07:59.009 --> 08:00.310
Now get out.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.319
Darla...

08:19.529 --> 08:23.500
...I've been calling all night.
Why haven't you answered?

08:26.730 --> 08:28.980
Get away from the window.
It's not safe.

08:30.930 --> 08:35.070
They called an emergency meeting
tonight after what happened.

08:36.929 --> 08:40.649
The official order on you
is to stake on sight.

08:51.929 --> 08:56.039
You should've told me your plan.
I would've talked you out of it.

08:56.730 --> 08:58.480
Helped you. I don't know.

09:03.929 --> 09:06.250
Things are getting complicated for us.

09:06.929 --> 09:10.019
Yes. Yes, I believe they are.

09:10.529 --> 09:12.350
We should clear your stuff out.

09:12.929 --> 09:15.879
Move it in my bedroom.
I just think it'd be best for us....

09:21.330 --> 09:24.240
Darla, what's wrong? What is this?

09:29.129 --> 09:30.879
Where'd you get this?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.779
What's the difference?
It doesn't work.

09:34.529 --> 09:38.779
Of course not. After Angel stole it,
there was a disenchanting ceremony.

09:39.929 --> 09:41.509
How did you get this?

09:43.529 --> 09:45.320
It was my payment.

09:48.929 --> 09:52.580
Your payment?
What are you talking about?

09:53.129 --> 09:55.620
- What do you think?
- I don't know!

10:08.730 --> 10:10.409
What happened?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.899
Nothing. Nothing happened.

10:17.730 --> 10:21.450
- My God, nothing at all.
- Tell me. I have to know.

10:23.129 --> 10:26.110
You want details?
Is that what you want?

10:26.730 --> 10:28.980
Yes, I want details.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.610
I need to know everything. All of it.

10:36.330 --> 10:37.940
What did he do to you?

10:47.610 --> 10:50.379
All right! All right, already.

10:51.809 --> 10:55.139
I'm not deaf, you know.
Jeez, keep your pants on!

10:59.009 --> 11:01.850
I see we're a little late
with that advice.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.960
Probably should've killed her.

11:08.610 --> 11:11.350
Kill her, give her cab fare. Whatever.

11:12.210 --> 11:16.779
The point is, you've turned a corner.
Yeah, you. Zuzu's petals.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.120
It's about time.

11:20.610 --> 11:25.029
If it had taken you much longer to
hit your bottom, I was gonna kick it.

11:29.009 --> 11:31.710
- I don't understand what happened.
- What?

11:32.610 --> 11:36.679
You're not the first guy who saw
what was lying next to him and went--

11:38.009 --> 11:40.259
You're not, believe me.

11:42.809 --> 11:46.600
It's called a moment of clarity,
my lamb, and you've just had one.

11:48.809 --> 11:52.289
Sort of appalling to see
where you've gotten yourself.

11:53.009 --> 11:55.399
- How do I get back?
- That's the thing.

11:56.009 --> 11:59.419
You don't. You go on to
the new place, whatever that is.

12:02.610 --> 12:03.980
I don't know if I can.

12:09.210 --> 12:12.690
I've done things.

12:15.809 --> 12:17.559
Questionable things.

12:18.210 --> 12:21.860
Yes, you have. But you
didn't kill those lawyers.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.590
That was slated to happen.

12:24.809 --> 12:28.070
The Powers tried to work it
so it'd be without you.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.659
You weren't much help.

12:30.809 --> 12:33.830
If they wanted me to stay away,
why not tell me?

12:35.009 --> 12:38.340
Would you listen? And what
makes you think they didn't?

12:38.610 --> 12:41.490
Over and over and,
as for example, over?

12:42.210 --> 12:44.210
They could've been more specific.

12:45.210 --> 12:48.090
Isn't this the 'tude
that got you here?

12:48.809 --> 12:53.379
If you're gonna switch back to
brood mode, we'd rather have you evil.

12:54.210 --> 12:57.330
Then, at least, leather pants.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.519
What now?

13:01.409 --> 13:04.919
- What do you mean?
- What do the Powers want me to do?

13:06.809 --> 13:09.580
Am I hearing voices? No, I'm not.

13:10.409 --> 13:12.730
I was never your link with the Powers.

13:13.409 --> 13:15.799
You lost that when
you fired your crew.

13:17.009 --> 13:19.679
That's gonna be the
hardest part of this.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.980
- Yeah.
- And there's a good chance...

13:24.809 --> 13:27.059
...you can't put this back together.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.259
It just....

13:29.610 --> 13:32.909
- It depends, really.
- Whether they'll even talk to me.

13:33.809 --> 13:37.070
No, it depends on whether
they live through the night.

13:38.009 --> 13:42.649
And I gotta tell you, at the
moment, the odds? Not good.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.330
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

13:55.129 --> 13:56.740
Good night.

14:12.529 --> 14:13.830
Hello?

14:14.330 --> 14:15.870
Mrs. Sharp?

14:16.730 --> 14:17.889
Anybody home?

14:17.929 --> 14:19.649
Cordelia Chase here.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.419
If you haven't gone to bed already....

14:27.529 --> 14:31.289
Took me a little longer to
get here than I expected.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.240
Hope you're still paying your bill.

14:35.929 --> 14:38.980
Which I just happened to
bring with me.

14:41.929 --> 14:42.870
Hello?

15:15.649 --> 15:17.259
Well, that was helpful!

15:37.450 --> 15:38.960
Human!

15:40.450 --> 15:42.519
Destroyer of our spawn.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.169
Destroyer of your...?

15:48.250 --> 15:51.870
- Have we met?
- The others. Make them come to us.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.500
- What others?
- Three are responsible. Three must pay.

15:56.649 --> 15:59.809
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.659
I haven't destroyed
anyone's spawn. Promise.

16:09.250 --> 16:13.009
Hey, you have a third eye
in the back of your head...

16:14.049 --> 16:16.649
...just like that
little girl did before...

16:17.649 --> 16:22.179
- ...we destroyed your spawn.
- We've located the wheeled one.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.980
Where's the other?

16:26.049 --> 16:27.559
The wheeled one?

18:02.650 --> 18:04.970
- Angel!
- Invite me in. I haven't been here.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.559
- Invite me in.
- If you'd shown interest....

18:09.250 --> 18:10.230
Wesley.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.130
Absolutely. I invite you in.
In, I invite you!

18:21.849 --> 18:24.339
- What are they?
- The third eye indicates Skilosh.

18:24.849 --> 18:27.380
It's the first time
I've had occasion to--

18:27.849 --> 18:30.309
- How do I kill them?
- There are many ways.

18:31.450 --> 18:33.549
- Wesley!
- Right, yes.

18:35.049 --> 18:36.559
Hack it to pieces!

18:50.650 --> 18:52.160
I think I got it.

18:56.650 --> 18:59.180
I only pray Mrs. Starns isn't at home.

19:06.849 --> 19:08.250
What are you doing here?

20:00.490 --> 20:03.859
- She's not picking up.
- She wasn't at home before, either.

20:04.690 --> 20:07.180
I stopped by before
I went to your place.

20:08.289 --> 20:10.609
Did you? Just keep going straight.

20:11.890 --> 20:15.440
So I guess you're probably
wondering why I'm back.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.690
Hadn't occurred to me.
Take a right turn.

20:19.089 --> 20:22.279
- I know how to get to your offices.
- Yes, you did pop by.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.079
Stole a book.

20:29.289 --> 20:32.240
- I'll avoid the bumps.
- I'd appreciate that.

20:33.490 --> 20:37.910
Actually, it's kind of funny.
I recently got a gut wound myself.

20:41.289 --> 20:44.240
Not a gunshot like you got there...

20:44.890 --> 20:47.660
...but it was kind of...

20:48.490 --> 20:53.059
...an antique sword, is what it was.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.049
It went deep.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.930
Yes, it did.

21:05.289 --> 21:07.430
- Hey, guess who stabbed me?
- Darla.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.049
Yeah.

21:10.690 --> 21:14.759
Actually, kind of a funny story.
The reason I had this epiphany.

21:17.890 --> 21:21.049
- Tell me about these Skilosh demons.
- Very well.

21:22.089 --> 21:26.230
A family contracted us at Angel
Investigations to investigate...

21:26.890 --> 21:29.910
...a third eye on the back
of their daughter's head.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.700
Oh, really?
You kept the name?

21:33.490 --> 21:34.650
Pardon?

21:36.490 --> 21:39.160
You kept the name,
"Angel Investigations."

21:40.089 --> 21:41.769
We're gonna change it.

21:43.690 --> 21:46.039
- Go on.
- I diagnosed the girl's condition...

21:46.690 --> 21:48.650
...as "infection by a Skilosh."

21:49.089 --> 21:50.670
- With your books.
- Yes.

21:51.490 --> 21:55.390
You were always so good with
your books. Made it look so easy.

21:56.890 --> 21:57.900
You know, it isn't.

21:58.690 --> 22:03.259
Skilosh: a violent, asexual,
self-replicating species of demon.

22:04.089 --> 22:08.589
Has the habit of injecting its demon
spawn into the skull of a human host.

22:09.490 --> 22:14.019
A key diagnostic symptom is the third
eye in the back of the host's head.

22:15.490 --> 22:17.309
If this condition is not arrested...

22:17.289 --> 22:21.049
...a newborn Skilosh will erupt
from the skull of its human host.

22:22.089 --> 22:25.740
- But you guys saved the little girl?
- Yes, we did.

22:28.089 --> 22:29.630
You did a good thing.

22:33.490 --> 22:34.470
Thank you.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.140
You're welcome.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.480
"Hey, look behind you!" is
really not gonna work, is it?

22:55.170 --> 22:56.890
Two more have been destroyed.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.430
What?

22:59.970 --> 23:04.250
Oh, no!
Wesley, Gunn! You killed them?

23:05.970 --> 23:09.619
You horrible, ugly, three-eyed--

23:10.769 --> 23:11.930
Three must pay.

23:13.170 --> 23:17.740
Oh, two of you have
been destroyed. Okay.

23:19.769 --> 23:22.890
Oh, that's bad.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.289
- I'm sorry?
- More must rise.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.000
No. Hey, hey, wait a sec! Guys!

23:29.970 --> 23:33.200
- More must rise.
- No! No more must rise, honest!

23:33.569 --> 23:37.890
I've been impregnated by demon spawn
before. Didn't really work out.

23:41.970 --> 23:45.480
Oh, God. Please don't
do this. Please, no!

23:47.369 --> 23:50.630
Let go! Don't! Please!

23:52.170 --> 23:54.380
No! Let go!

24:21.890 --> 24:23.220
She's not here.

24:24.289 --> 24:25.970
That doesn't bode well.

24:28.490 --> 24:30.349
That truck's passed three times.

24:30.890 --> 24:33.799
- Maybe she's out on a date.
- That's unlikely.

24:34.490 --> 24:36.450
- It's Friday night.
- So?

24:36.890 --> 24:40.079
We are talking about the same
Cordelia Chase, right?

24:41.089 --> 24:41.960
Correct.

24:42.289 --> 24:43.940
- Knowing her--
- But you don't.

24:44.690 --> 24:48.339
You don't know her at all.
For months now, you haven't cared to.

24:48.890 --> 24:52.369
Otherwise, you'd have realized
Cordelia has become very solitary.

24:53.089 --> 24:56.210
She's not the vain, carefree
creature she once was.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.569
Well, certainly not carefree.

25:00.890 --> 25:04.440
It's the visions. The visions
that were meant to guide you.

25:05.089 --> 25:08.599
You could turn away from them.
She doesn't have that luxury.

25:09.289 --> 25:12.700
She experiences this city's pain,
and because of who she is...

25:13.490 --> 25:15.910
...she's compelled to do
something about it.

25:18.289 --> 25:21.029
It's left her little time
for anything else.

25:22.490 --> 25:25.440
You'd have known that,
if your head wasn't up your...

25:26.089 --> 25:28.579
...place that isn't
on top of your neck.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.200
We have to find her.

25:35.089 --> 25:38.069
We agree on that.
She could be in grave danger.

25:38.690 --> 25:40.619
And even if she's not....

25:44.690 --> 25:47.180
- Something's coming.
- Turn off the lights.

25:48.289 --> 25:50.180
The Skilosh may have followed us.

26:12.289 --> 26:13.369
Gunn!

26:14.089 --> 26:17.210
- What are you doing here?
- Passing by. Saw the lights on.

26:18.289 --> 26:20.849
- Besides, I work here.
- I thought you'd gone.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.240
Yeah, but that don't mean
I wasn't coming back.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.559
Did you think I'd
abandon you like this guy?

26:28.490 --> 26:32.180
- No, certainly not.
- English, you know you my man.

26:36.289 --> 26:38.009
I see you guys have bonded.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.039
- We fight together.
- Hip to shoulder.

26:41.690 --> 26:44.150
- He took a bullet for me.
- It was nothing.

26:47.089 --> 26:49.410
- What's he doing here?
- Saw the host at Caritas.

26:50.089 --> 26:52.230
He said my friends were in danger.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.410
- What's he doing here?
- He had an epiphany.

26:57.289 --> 27:01.009
- Why are you hiding?
- There was a demon attack at my home.

27:01.490 --> 27:03.000
- I saved him.
- We were followed.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.730
- Demon attack?
- Skilosh.

27:05.690 --> 27:08.009
- I thought we got rid of that.
- We did.

27:08.089 --> 27:10.759
That's why we're targeted
for retribution.

27:11.690 --> 27:13.200
- Where's Cordy?
- We don't know.

27:13.490 --> 27:15.839
- You checked her pad?
- I stopped by.

27:16.490 --> 27:20.069
You enjoying your visit to 1973?
I meant her message pad.

27:20.690 --> 27:23.359
Oh, right, yeah. That's a good idea.

27:24.289 --> 27:28.190
Use this to rub the impression
of the last thing she wrote.

27:29.089 --> 27:31.829
- Or we could just read the carbon.
- Or that.

27:33.289 --> 27:35.039
- Directions.
- Let me see.

27:38.089 --> 27:41.740
That's the Sharps' address, the
family whose daughter we treated.

27:42.289 --> 27:45.029
She wrote that tonight.
You think she went there?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.109
- She took the original.
- What'll they do?

27:47.690 --> 27:51.339
I hate to imagine. We must prepare.
Get the de-oculation powder.

27:52.490 --> 27:53.789
Guys. Guys?

27:54.289 --> 27:57.980
Would she go there in the middle of
the night without calling you?

27:59.089 --> 28:01.160
- They owe us money.
- Let's go.

28:26.369 --> 28:29.460
Oh, God, you're still here.

28:30.569 --> 28:32.529
You're not leaving, are you?

28:34.170 --> 28:38.000
And no one's coming for me.
No one's expecting me anyplace.

28:38.369 --> 28:40.470
No one's gonna miss me.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.859
And how come I can see you?

28:46.170 --> 28:49.359
Oh, no.

29:04.769 --> 29:06.099
Oh, no!

29:25.089 --> 29:26.980
- What is it?
- I don't know.

29:28.089 --> 29:29.700
Nothing, I guess.

29:30.490 --> 29:33.259
So you had an epiphany, did you?

29:34.690 --> 29:35.740
Yeah.

29:36.490 --> 29:38.700
What, you just wake up and bang?

29:39.490 --> 29:41.660
It was sort of the other way around.

29:44.289 --> 29:46.920
That's good you can have those.
Right, Wes?

29:47.289 --> 29:50.799
Epiphanies, they're handy.
When will you have another?

29:51.490 --> 29:53.069
- Gunn--
- No, I'm interested.

29:53.289 --> 29:56.410
They can strike any time.
Next time you see a lawyer...

29:57.490 --> 29:59.809
...you'll get epiphanied off at them.

30:01.690 --> 30:04.779
- No.
- No? You don't think so?

30:05.890 --> 30:09.079
Hope you don't have one
before we find Cordelia...

30:10.089 --> 30:13.990
...because if something happens to
her, I might just have an epiphany.

30:31.089 --> 30:32.420
- You okay?
- Yes.

30:35.890 --> 30:37.049
Angel?

30:40.089 --> 30:41.880
We should probably go.

30:43.089 --> 30:44.349
Yo, Angel.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.500
- You guys go ahead.
- What?

30:46.690 --> 30:50.170
If I don't stop them,
they'll flank us at the house.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.569
Then I'll meet you there.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.839
I'll be there. Just get to Cordelia.

31:45.329 --> 31:47.890
- Thank you. What do you see?
- She's in there.

31:48.329 --> 31:49.700
- Is she--?
- She's alive.

31:50.130 --> 31:52.160
- You sure?
- Yeah, her eyes are open.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.480
- All three of them.
- Oh, dear.

31:56.730 --> 31:57.990
- Wait. Three more.
- Eyes?

31:58.529 --> 31:59.720
Demons.

32:00.329 --> 32:04.259
The tribe's gathering. Gestation is
almost done. We have little time.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.289
Where is he?

32:29.730 --> 32:30.890
That's gotta hurt.

32:31.529 --> 32:34.579
It'll hurt more when the thing
gestating inside her hatches.

32:35.130 --> 32:38.430
Stop saying "gestating."
How long we gonna wait for Angel?

32:39.329 --> 32:40.559
- We're not.
- Good.

32:41.130 --> 32:42.319
- Why wait?
- We shouldn't.

32:42.930 --> 32:44.960
- We've done fine without him.
- Yes.

32:45.329 --> 32:48.559
- He orders us to wait and we do it?
- Hell, no.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.819
- He may have changed his mind.
- True.

32:51.329 --> 32:54.660
We're not going to sit idly by.
We're going in there...

32:56.730 --> 32:58.730
...and we're saving our friend.

32:59.130 --> 33:00.849
I say, let's do this.

33:01.529 --> 33:02.470
- One thing.
- What?

33:02.730 --> 33:04.200
I'm toppling over.

33:19.529 --> 33:21.319
You're gonna tell me everything.

33:27.329 --> 33:29.359
Everything you did with her.

33:31.529 --> 33:33.250
All of it.

33:35.130 --> 33:36.390
You're gonna tell me.

33:37.529 --> 33:40.619
- Why?
- Because I wanna hear it from you.

33:47.730 --> 33:49.170
Tell me!

33:51.930 --> 33:53.539
Tell me!

33:55.529 --> 33:56.690
Tell me!

33:58.529 --> 33:59.690
No.

34:14.730 --> 34:16.340
I'm sorry, Lindsey.

34:20.130 --> 34:21.360
I really am.

34:23.130 --> 34:25.159
I'm sorry she'll never love you.

34:27.329 --> 34:29.789
I'm sorry you have to live with that.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.719
That I didn't try harder to help you.

34:33.929 --> 34:36.030
That you made the wrong choice.

34:50.130 --> 34:53.539
Could've been the other one.
Be glad I had an epiphany.

34:54.929 --> 34:56.750
Mind if I borrow your truck?

35:05.449 --> 35:06.429
Gunn!

35:07.250 --> 35:08.159
Wesley!

35:09.050 --> 35:12.280
- We came to rescue you.
- I knew you would.

35:14.449 --> 35:17.010
But they caught us
coming in the back door.

35:20.449 --> 35:21.570
Thank you.

35:29.449 --> 35:31.170
More must rise.

35:35.449 --> 35:38.289
- This gonna hurt?
- A lot.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.320
Angel, hi.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.329
Hi.

36:42.050 --> 36:43.380
You okay?

36:43.849 --> 36:44.929
No.

36:46.849 --> 36:48.809
- You're not?
- No.

36:51.650 --> 36:54.320
You really hurt my feelings.

37:24.170 --> 37:25.329
Darla?

37:48.769 --> 37:50.449
I feel like such an idiot.

37:51.170 --> 37:52.849
A lot of that going around.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.900
I just couldn't....

37:57.170 --> 37:59.800
My whole life has been
about being a cop.

38:00.769 --> 38:03.719
If I'm not part of the force,
nothing I do means anything.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.539
- It doesn't.
- Doesn't what?

38:07.369 --> 38:11.019
Mean anything. In the greater
scheme, in the big picture...

38:11.570 --> 38:13.079
...nothing we do matters.

38:14.570 --> 38:16.849
There's no grand plan, no big win.

38:16.969 --> 38:20.829
- You seem chipper about that.
- I guess I kind of worked it out.

38:22.369 --> 38:26.940
If there's no great glorious end to
all this, if nothing we do matters...

38:28.369 --> 38:30.650
...then all that matters
is what we do.

38:31.969 --> 38:35.300
Because that's all there is.
What we do. Now, today.

38:37.969 --> 38:41.230
I fought for so long for
redemption, for a reward...

38:42.170 --> 38:46.139
...and finally just to beat the
other guy. But I never got it.

38:47.570 --> 38:50.199
- Now you do?
- Not all of it.

38:51.769 --> 38:54.090
All I wanna do is help.
I wanna help...

38:54.170 --> 38:56.980
...because people shouldn't
suffer as they do.

38:58.369 --> 39:01.110
Because if there's
no bigger meaning...

39:01.369 --> 39:05.510
...then the smallest act of kindness
is the greatest thing in the world.

39:07.969 --> 39:12.179
- You've had an epiphany.
- I say that, but nobody's listening.

39:13.369 --> 39:16.880
I'm pretty much convinced,
since I'm alive to be convinced.

39:17.570 --> 39:20.170
- You don't have to be a cop to--
- I'm okay.

39:21.170 --> 39:23.590
I'm not headed for
another pill-a-thon.

39:25.969 --> 39:27.409
I'm very grateful.

39:29.570 --> 39:31.889
I never thought you'd
come for me, but...

39:34.369 --> 39:36.900
...I got cut a huge break,
and I believe....

39:37.969 --> 39:39.969
I don't know what I believe, but...

39:41.570 --> 39:43.500
...I have faith.

39:44.570 --> 39:46.820
I think maybe we're not alone in this.

39:47.570 --> 39:49.289
Why?

39:50.570 --> 39:52.599
Because I never invited you in.

40:06.409 --> 40:09.500
Angel Investigations. We help
the helpless. How can we...

40:13.610 --> 40:14.800
...help you?

40:19.010 --> 40:20.519
The check is in the mail.

40:26.809 --> 40:28.179
I'm sorry.

40:43.010 --> 40:45.429
Before you say any more...

40:47.210 --> 40:49.670
...we've discussed it,
and we're not ready--

40:50.210 --> 40:53.829
It's okay, Wesley. I don't want
you to come back and work for me.

40:55.010 --> 40:57.219
Oh. I see.

40:59.210 --> 41:00.610
I wanna work for you.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.309
You wanna work for us?

41:04.610 --> 41:06.889
Yeah, I do.

41:08.210 --> 41:09.369
Why?

41:10.610 --> 41:12.260
Because I think I can help.

41:14.809 --> 41:17.579
How do we know we can trust you?

41:19.010 --> 41:21.780
I guess I'll just have to earn that.

41:23.210 --> 41:24.510
No.

41:25.610 --> 41:26.800
No.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.130
No!

41:34.809 --> 41:39.380
The usual big scary, rising up in
a housing project in Topanga.

41:40.010 --> 41:42.329
Why am I not on the floor this time?

41:43.010 --> 41:44.309
I've got you.

41:51.409 --> 41:52.920
Maybe he should drive?

41:55.610 --> 41:56.800
Let's go.

42:35.210 --> 42:36.079
Thank you,
