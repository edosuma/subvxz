01:24.416 --> 01:27.503
There was once a distant province

01:27.670 --> 01:29.838
Similiana tribe existed.

01:30.005 --> 01:34.426
Them,
were captured by King Laypach.

01:35.636 --> 01:37.429
After a century of slavery,

01:37.638 --> 01:40.975
Similia people were devoted
the great Gerrard Andrade.

01:41.308 --> 01:44.269
Andrade was a swordsman impressive

01:44.561 --> 01:46.855
the leader of the similianos.

01:47.064 --> 01:51.068
Died in the 13th battle
similianos many soldiers,

01:51.735 --> 01:54.738
Similia the king was killed
in that battle.

01:55.114 --> 02:00.869
In return, forced Laypach
similianos to wander the land.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.373
Andrade killed thousands
The King's Men

02:04.498 --> 02:05.624
with his mighty sword.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.501
before being captured and beheaded.

02:07.751 --> 02:09.627
Before the ax
broke his flesh,

02:09.961 --> 02:12.464
Andrade made a promise to his people.

02:13.841 --> 02:17.845
I will give my life for the future of the tribe
of Similia

02:18.470 --> 02:21.890
We occupied this land
since the beginning of the universe

02:22.850 --> 02:26.395
My spirit descend
Gerrard in a powerful,

02:26.854 --> 02:30.024
and he will destroy our oppressors,

02:30.357 --> 02:34.403
and will lead to the holy land
Promethea.

02:35.070 --> 02:39.283
Those were his last words.

02:55.049 --> 03:00.888
TRAVEL PROMETEA

03:35.756 --> 03:38.300
Eight years later ...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.235
This is a waste of time.

03:57.653 --> 04:00.906
Do not be violent,
know it's old.

04:03.492 --> 04:04.910
Can you do it?

04:05.160 --> 04:08.372
No, son, one day not be here.

04:08.747 --> 04:11.458
You're going to drink milk when you're not, right?

04:11.667 --> 04:14.211
Do not say that father
live forever.

04:14.545 --> 04:18.382
Treat it as if it were you.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.386
One first and one after.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.892
I hate that cow.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.853
Wait.
- It's good for you my son.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.855
I learn, I will.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.443
- Smooth Moves.
-O.K.

04:39.987 --> 04:42.615
Will not achieve anything like that.

04:43.532 --> 04:45.743
Look for the form.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.040
There you go, a bucket.

04:51.957 --> 04:55.336
Do not play.

05:07.973 --> 05:09.767
I hit her in the head with the roof!

05:17.650 --> 05:19.985
What did the sea to the sand?

05:21.654 --> 05:24.782
No, there were only waves.

05:30.913 --> 05:34.208
How many are needed similianos

05:34.542 --> 05:37.294
to kill a wild beast?

05:38.212 --> 05:42.258
No, a wild beast
can not kill another.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.903
Come here.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.490
My king, sir ...

06:06.699 --> 06:08.993
We have overwhelming news.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.872
We have come like a storm
our spirit.

06:13.330 --> 06:16.250
A terrible storm is coming

06:16.500 --> 06:19.420
Well, what happens?

06:20.337 --> 06:23.257
The prophecy is to be fulfilled.

06:23.757 --> 06:27.386
The young man who was elected
to rise up against

06:27.595 --> 06:29.930
Laypach King and his army

06:30.181 --> 06:32.349
and we felt in our spirit

06:32.516 --> 06:34.435
that this will happen.

06:34.643 --> 06:37.563
The child has already reached the required age.

06:38.105 --> 06:40.399
And who is that guy?

06:40.900 --> 06:44.987
We do not know ....
my king.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.534
Why do you say scholars
if they know nothing?

06:51.952 --> 06:54.413
How will we know who is he?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.666
By the light, my king.

06:59.251 --> 07:00.878
Does the light?

07:01.295 --> 07:04.465
He holds degrees in light of Gerrard

07:04.965 --> 07:06.634
in his eyes.

07:07.843 --> 07:09.720
How do I stop?

07:09.929 --> 07:13.891
You must keep found
the only daughter of the king, Aria,

07:14.266 --> 07:17.561
Princess similiana.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.273
If she has the sword Andrade

07:21.899 --> 07:23.526
and gives the child chosen

07:23.734 --> 07:25.486
will be defeated.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.031
Once you place the sword
in stone

07:29.490 --> 07:31.659
as stated in prophecy

07:32.284 --> 07:34.412
you will turn into dust,

07:34.578 --> 07:37.415
and his kingdom will fall ...

07:37.873 --> 07:40.042
fulfilling prophecy.

07:44.171 --> 07:45.923
I understood nothing of what they said,

07:46.090 --> 07:48.467
Why will not find me
that boy?

07:48.634 --> 07:51.429
! Look at my best unit
and bring it

07:51.679 --> 07:53.722
Move,
now!

07:55.599 --> 07:58.227
I knew that would bring problems.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.063
Damn Buddhas.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.442
What does that mean?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.746
I can not stand the smell of these people.

08:16.912 --> 08:18.831
I agree with you brother.

08:19.331 --> 08:23.210
We must leave here
and continue with our lives.

08:23.627 --> 08:27.006
The problem is how to take off
this odor.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.799
It will take at least 10 years

08:28.966 --> 08:31.135
take away the smell of these people
skin.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.056
I'm afraid my wife
not want to touch me.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.063
Get up.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.231
Standing!

08:44.398 --> 08:46.025
I said that you will stand!

08:47.318 --> 08:48.569
Get up.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.238
Take off your kid.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.037
Beware!

09:10.341 --> 09:11.842
Father!

09:23.062 --> 09:24.814
Wait!

09:26.691 --> 09:29.193
A good show.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.196
It seems that these people
Gerrard is one among them.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.864
Did you kill sir?

09:34.281 --> 09:36.826
It swordsmanship.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.537
Bring him, forced him to fight

09:39.662 --> 09:41.080
in the king's army.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.211
Father!

09:48.879 --> 09:50.381
If someone else

09:54.176 --> 09:56.178
dares to challenge the power

09:56.345 --> 09:59.140
and the king's authority Laypach.

10:01.892 --> 10:06.522
You must do something,
should not allow this.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.399
Move!

11:20.846 --> 11:23.599
Do not run Magnus.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.184
How do you know my name?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.521
Not be here if not
out by name.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.275
You are the fiercest of Gerrard,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.986
I have traveled many miles

11:35.319 --> 11:38.030
to see you personally.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.408
It makes no sense, only
work with animals.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.661
A Magnus meets his destiny

11:43.869 --> 11:45.913
so has the universe.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.848
True,
The prophecy was fulfilled.

12:04.307 --> 12:08.811
The village will be released similiano

12:25.745 --> 12:27.955
Sir?

12:28.581 --> 12:33.920
We could get some information
by the moon.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.632
He has revealed where
is the boy.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.344
Where is it?

12:41.928 --> 12:46.599
In the forest ...
Kivu in the forest.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.478
And it will bring me.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.077
No way.
Why the gods

13:06.285 --> 13:09.413
let me catch a
of His creatures this month?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.541
Only one.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.589
I can taste the meat.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.510
Who's there?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.846
Show yourself.

13:26.556 --> 13:30.393
This is my last warning
out of there.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.104
Do not shoot.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.149
My name is Macnus Almirance

13:37.316 --> 13:40.069
Graylord son Almirance
and son of the great Almirance.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.447
Really?

13:43.573 --> 13:45.074
Yes
- Tales.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.702
Why do not you walk with your family?

13:48.619 --> 13:49.787
Is it an ambush?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.791
No, my father was murdered.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.877
My brother was captured.

14:00.506 --> 14:06.345
If you're a Almirance
the disappointment of your family.

14:07.889 --> 14:11.100
How dare you insult
the name of my family, hunter? !

14:11.851 --> 14:15.396
I challenge him to a duel side by side
to death.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.407
I am very skilled in combat.

14:27.658 --> 14:31.996
Will have a painful death.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.416
Decapitaré you with one movement.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.921
Remain captive in my fists.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.508
What Humiliate,
It will be my slave.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.975
Do not kill me, please.

14:52.726 --> 14:57.731
Do not threaten me again.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.404
Well, my name is Ari.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.198
My family is not famous.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.658
Could defeat
but I have not eaten all day.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.744
Fortunately for me.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.540
Go eat something.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.683
Lord ...

15:35.852 --> 15:40.690
I'm looking forward to going into battle

15:42.359 --> 15:44.444
the crush,

15:45.237 --> 15:47.906
devour their children.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.078
I have something more dangerous for you.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.337
What brings you to this forest?

16:02.504 --> 16:03.672
Less competition.

16:04.256 --> 16:08.260
Nobody wants to be so far
of civilization.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.886
Makes sense.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.599
I'm a little everywhere.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.645
Are you a mercenary?

16:19.563 --> 16:21.356
What kind of question is that?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.444
I have seen many soldiers.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.488
His accent,

16:28.739 --> 16:31.533
is the territory of King Laypach.

16:32.576 --> 16:36.038
You're very observant farmer.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.207
I want to avenge the death of my father

16:39.333 --> 16:41.293
and rescue my brother Binon.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.920
Assembling an army in name
My grandfather King.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.094
You're a great comedian.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.222
You can leave me to kill you now.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.641
Quick, painless,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.644
I can save you many problems.

17:00.354 --> 17:04.148
At least I can prevent
Be burned at the stake.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.568
"Burning at the stake?

17:06.859 --> 17:10.196
That I fear
to go with me

17:12.031 --> 17:15.452
Laypach King .....
is a tyrant.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.663
He ordered the death of his mother

17:17.788 --> 17:19.830
for not sharing his reign.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.251
I thought that was just a story.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.462
Some are true.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.508
Were you in the king's army?

17:30.384 --> 17:31.843
I will not argue that.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.930
We will camp here.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.641
We have a few hours before
of nightfall.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.978
You earn food
helping to build the shelter.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.523
I will.

17:45.315 --> 17:48.026
And speak no more of army
or revenge

17:48.151 --> 17:49.361
while you're with me.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.199
If you wish to kill,
forward.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.410
I prefer to live.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.583
I will guide you to the king's lands.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.044
After that, you're on your own.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.299
You will have a certain death.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.848
! Let me go

18:20.142 --> 18:21.935
Wise men say

18:22.811 --> 18:25.063
you are an artist with the sword.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.733
Let me go.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.568
I will,

18:30.527 --> 18:33.822
then give me some information.

18:35.365 --> 18:41.955
Are you planning to take off the throne?

18:44.541 --> 18:47.461
Would you become the king's rival?

18:53.508 --> 18:55.260
Check it out immediately.

18:59.431 --> 19:04.436
Take your time
because the kingdom is safe.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.571
Is he?

19:16.365 --> 19:20.494
No, but we feel ...

19:21.912 --> 19:24.998
which is close to that boy.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.834
Maybe it's brother or son.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.671
Who is he?
Where is it?

19:30.837 --> 19:34.800
- Talk or die today.
- Do not say anything.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.554
I'll ask again.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.349
Where is it?

19:44.851 --> 19:48.355
Guards, take him to the cell.

19:48.564 --> 19:52.693
azótenlo until the skin
you hang on the bones.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.779
Wise, if I have no answers

19:55.946 --> 19:57.906
to dawn

19:58.407 --> 20:01.368
I rip your head
if I'm not useful, understand?

20:02.536 --> 20:04.121
Their heads.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.002
We know very well this forest.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.088
As the palm of my hand.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.675
I've been here many years.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.720
Why is so far from home?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.765
Sometimes a man must
find himself.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.268
It is also a poet.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.897
My brother wrote a poem

20:30.063 --> 20:32.232
for a lady who wanted
to be his wife.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.276
How do you say?

20:34.651 --> 20:37.613
Oh, I'm haunted my princess

20:37.988 --> 20:39.406
and hides the treasure

20:39.615 --> 20:41.658
in the deepest part of my being.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.911
I live for you

20:44.244 --> 20:45.829
breathe for you

20:46.079 --> 20:47.873
and pray for you,

20:48.081 --> 20:50.209
the dream of the gods

20:50.417 --> 20:52.753
only have eyes for me.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.839
Did it work?

20:56.089 --> 20:59.509
No, she was taken to the harem of the king.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.720
He died in childbirth.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.391
How can one man have
so bad inside?

21:07.100 --> 21:10.103
The gods will not allow
extends the situation any longer.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.690
According to the legends of your people

21:13.815 --> 21:15.943
Gerrard will reach a large
to free them.

21:16.193 --> 21:19.404
Yes, and take the similiano
to the promised land.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.323
Yes, Prometea.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.075
A romantic story.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.745
There is a story
Prometea is real.

21:27.746 --> 21:28.872
My brother Binon said ...

21:28.997 --> 21:31.208
Stop talking about your brother!

21:32.543 --> 21:35.045
You are a man, put your feet
on the ground.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.841
Stop telling achievements
and stories of other person.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.219
Do not have intrinsic value?

21:42.803 --> 21:44.930
Soon as I can see,

21:45.138 --> 21:47.015
avenge the death of my father

21:47.140 --> 21:49.142
and redeem my brother.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.404
If you live enough
Macnus young,

22:01.905 --> 22:07.119
will experience joys and sorrows.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.123
It's the gift and the curse
of the gods.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.710
And this gift is that

22:14.960 --> 22:16.962
time heals
all wounds.

22:17.546 --> 22:17.796
only time.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.006
Only time.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.759
Not revenge, nor pity,

22:24.803 --> 22:28.682
Macnus only time.

22:31.602 --> 22:34.062
Tell me, you know fight?

22:34.855 --> 22:36.482
A little, yes.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.235
I'll make a deal with you.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.988
I know a thing or two about fighting.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.364
I'll teach you to fight.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.201
And what is my part in the deal?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.830
I will refrain from poetry
in my presence.

23:16.521 --> 23:18.106
Where is it?!

24:06.487 --> 24:08.781
Calm down, I am.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.367
Do you follow?

24:11.743 --> 24:12.910
Are you sure?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.412
Of course.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.623
Did you find it?
- Yes.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.752
Is he?
- Yes

24:27.508 --> 24:28.885
I see it.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.845
Princess is very dangerous.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.514
Nonsense, travel at night.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.434
Not a good idea.

24:37.018 --> 24:40.271
The king's army Laypach
are patrolling the forest

24:40.480 --> 24:42.982
because they are seeking.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.567
Never find it.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.489
They could not find their heads.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.992
The servants pack my things,

24:53.284 --> 24:54.744
we go when night falls.

24:54.952 --> 24:55.995
Your Highness.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.622
Do not worry,

24:57.914 --> 24:59.707
the gods protect us.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.010
"I can sit for a minute?

25:11.344 --> 25:12.887
Yes, of course.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.811
My name is Magnus.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.856
"I can work for a piece
your game?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.117
Thanks for your time.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.580
The grandson of a king
never ask.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.459
You can bring the wood.

25:45.128 --> 25:47.547
We can not carry the wood.

25:48.631 --> 25:49.882
Return.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.112
Enough.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.781
Why do not you like the song, man?

27:37.740 --> 27:39.534
It's a silly song.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.287
It's a silly story and I'm
tired of hearing it.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.789
Although it was.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.251
if we believe then it is real, right?

27:51.045 --> 27:53.214
What is reality?

27:54.132 --> 27:57.260
Only your perception of it.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.221
How can trust the promise

28:00.346 --> 28:01.973
after so long?

28:02.307 --> 28:04.434
Face the reality
are lost.

28:06.811 --> 28:09.772
While not tell
and think you are lost

28:10.231 --> 28:12.108
then it will be,

28:12.442 --> 28:16.070
The prophecies of his time
be manifested son.

28:16.321 --> 28:18.197
Nonsense.

28:18.823 --> 28:22.869
They are filled with fairy tales

28:23.077 --> 28:25.413
and songs and fantasies,

28:25.747 --> 28:28.166
whatever it takes to escape
the cruel reality

28:28.374 --> 28:30.043
of those who oppress them.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.795
I speak the truth, that's all

28:34.339 --> 28:38.176
The truth is so elusive
like the wind.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.347
Can only be attained through faith.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.934
The truth is inside you.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.441
My apologies for speaking out.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.026
We must go.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.986
Get your things Magnus.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.240
The party has just begun.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.493
Then stay here farmer.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.120
Thank you for your hospitality.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.880
The all powerful would Gerrard.

29:18.049 --> 29:21.094
Ari expected.
Wait.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.352
A bit more.

29:38.278 --> 29:42.156
Let me out!

29:42.323 --> 29:44.325
I demand to speak with the king!

29:56.462 --> 29:58.548
Calm down boy.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.843
Do not listen.

30:02.552 --> 30:05.972
You're wasting your time.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.145
Who are you?

30:17.150 --> 30:20.403
I is not there.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.616
Please save poetry

30:25.033 --> 30:27.118
I do not humor.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.712
I'm nothing,

30:38.755 --> 30:43.927
my life was discarded by the king.

30:44.886 --> 30:48.389
How to waste
if you still breathe?

30:51.893 --> 30:54.020
No longer exist.

30:56.648 --> 30:59.567
My family was murdered.

31:00.527 --> 31:04.906
My wife was taken
the king's harem.

31:08.868 --> 31:14.624
I've been here many days.

31:19.754 --> 31:22.882
I no longer tale.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.510
I talk to the king.

31:26.469 --> 31:29.222
I was cursed by the gods,

31:29.597 --> 31:31.891
I'm not alive!

31:34.561 --> 31:36.437
Are you crazy?

31:38.439 --> 31:42.861
You hit many times a day.

31:45.530 --> 31:50.285
Hit you until you talk.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.662
I will defend to the death.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.373
Defend the honor of my family.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.504
No longer count the days.

32:05.175 --> 32:07.469
I suggest you do the same.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.599
I demand to speak with the king!

32:13.641 --> 32:16.352
I am the grandson of King Almirance!

32:16.811 --> 32:18.897
I demand to see the king!

32:33.870 --> 32:35.747
Why can not fight for the king?

32:37.415 --> 32:39.667
I told you,
not discuss it with you.

32:41.711 --> 32:43.838
I just wanted to talk about something.

32:45.256 --> 32:48.051
I prefer it to be boring.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.514
My brother Binon ...

32:53.139 --> 32:55.391
Again with your brother.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.894
I hear your pain and your delusions the whole day

32:58.103 --> 33:00.063
and you know what to do with you.

33:00.605 --> 33:03.525
We throw wild beasts
for you to devour.

33:04.484 --> 33:07.362
How dare you talk like that?!
End of you.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.914
Let's see.

33:28.758 --> 33:31.010
If you're traveling with me

33:31.302 --> 33:32.887
learns to fight.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.598
I will not carry dead weight.

34:03.668 --> 34:06.379
You'd be dead

35:18.952 --> 35:20.620
We traveled all night.

35:20.870 --> 35:24.541
Let's rest to recover breath.

35:37.929 --> 35:39.431
Eat princess.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.438
I can not eat.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.649
I can not sleep.

35:49.983 --> 35:51.943
My heart is anxious

35:52.152 --> 35:56.114
I try to calm down
to avoid disappointment.

35:58.158 --> 36:00.160
With all due respect,

36:00.535 --> 36:02.537
you worry too much.

36:03.079 --> 36:06.541
No one can stop what the gods
aligned to the universe.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.711
The time is now.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.963
Now is the time.

36:13.089 --> 36:15.050
What if not?

36:15.633 --> 36:17.886
Do not live to see the day?

36:18.219 --> 36:19.679
That is my greatest fear

36:20.722 --> 36:22.223
not see the day.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.353
We can not live a life
controlled by fear.

36:26.978 --> 36:30.482
Faith is the perfect antidote
for fear.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.985
The action is the best vaccine.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.196
Come find your strength.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.990
We can not stay long
time in one place.

36:39.824 --> 36:42.952
The carry you until I fall
if I must.

36:44.287 --> 36:47.624
You've always been like a sister to me.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.585
No matter princess.

36:51.461 --> 36:54.047
Would gladly give my life for theirs.

36:54.631 --> 36:56.758
While alive,

36:57.550 --> 36:59.427
protect her.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.974
Okay, you've given me strength.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.019
Let's continue.

37:16.319 --> 37:17.904
You've slept enough.

37:18.321 --> 37:20.699
If you sleep you do not eat.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.038
What?
- Nothing, Gods

37:27.247 --> 37:29.040
We have been blessed with a good fish.

37:29.457 --> 37:30.625
Get up.

37:47.350 --> 37:49.603
Had not noticed that
I was so hungry.

37:50.687 --> 37:54.608
Well, all that dream
whets the appetite.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.278
Remember to chew.

37:59.946 --> 38:02.282
We do not have much time
we must move fast.

38:02.991 --> 38:05.910
King sure we are looking for.

38:06.661 --> 38:08.830
I'm looking for him
Why he'd look at me?

38:10.206 --> 38:13.168
Well, it sure feels that
must finish the job.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.295
Has already killed your entire family.

38:16.796 --> 38:17.964
Do not you think ...

38:21.343 --> 38:22.469
Sorry ...

38:24.012 --> 38:25.680
Binon not know.

38:26.723 --> 38:29.309
He is a great soldier

38:29.935 --> 38:32.479
he would not fall into the jaws of the king.

38:32.687 --> 38:33.980
He is not dead.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.942
Do not die.

38:41.696 --> 38:44.449
We must continue.

39:04.719 --> 39:06.680
Who's there?

39:07.264 --> 39:11.851
I feel the strength of your horses
in my stomach.

39:12.477 --> 39:15.313
You must be a man.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.483
Go about your wife,
we're just going,

39:18.608 --> 39:20.902
leave us in peace.

39:21.152 --> 39:24.155
Charity for hungry servant.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.825
I'll read your hand

39:27.075 --> 39:30.871
and I will say that the gods tell you.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.920
Give me your hand.

39:55.687 --> 39:58.773
Let go slut!

40:01.318 --> 40:06.031
Your soul is consumed

40:06.198 --> 40:08.992
the thirst for blood!

40:09.201 --> 40:13.246
A fire that burns inside you,

40:13.663 --> 40:18.084
is as dark as the depths of the earth.

40:19.252 --> 40:22.214
There is no joy for you.

40:22.464 --> 40:27.636
Your destiny is to kill and get killed.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.803
Should be close
of the king's lands.

40:40.608 --> 40:42.860
For God's sake,
there must be some way out.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.198
There is an exit.

40:49.033 --> 40:50.493
What is it?

40:50.993 --> 40:51.827
Dime.

40:52.286 --> 40:55.748
How do I know not to reveal the secret?

40:58.083 --> 40:59.460
You have my word.

41:03.422 --> 41:06.717
The only way out ...
Is death!

41:12.807 --> 41:16.435
Just tell the truth.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.771
Shut up beast!

41:18.979 --> 41:21.899
Live to see my children grow.

41:22.483 --> 41:24.151
Do not talk about death!

41:24.318 --> 41:25.903
- Accept it!
- Shut up!

41:26.070 --> 41:27.947
You are doomed!
- Shut up!

41:28.364 --> 41:30.116
You will die!
- Shut up!

41:30.199 --> 41:30.991
If you are like me.

41:31.117 --> 41:37.206
Die ... Like me.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.315
Protect the princess!

42:19.290 --> 42:21.667
That was easy.

42:50.196 --> 42:52.114
is the will of the gods.

43:07.254 --> 43:08.923
I was a soldier.

43:10.174 --> 43:14.220
One of the best in the king's army.

43:16.389 --> 43:18.391
A courageous Gerrard.

43:20.768 --> 43:26.982
I was in many battles.

43:29.985 --> 43:32.571
I killed many enemies

43:33.572 --> 43:35.658
Are you skilled with a sword?

43:36.867 --> 43:38.703
Yes, my friend.

43:38.911 --> 43:41.580
I am in prison because once

43:42.123 --> 43:45.000
I did not commit the murder
I ordered the king.

43:49.171 --> 43:50.381
What happened?

43:51.632 --> 43:54.468
They were crossing the river

43:55.928 --> 43:58.889
in the northern province of Bartha.

44:02.184 --> 44:05.021
City had burned to the ground.

44:10.401 --> 44:14.238
A brave soldier ...

44:15.573 --> 44:18.743
refused to kill a newborn,

44:19.660 --> 44:22.288
as the king had ordered.

44:27.710 --> 44:30.296
I went to look for my post

44:31.881 --> 44:34.008
to kill his wife

44:34.592 --> 44:36.302
front of him.

44:41.807 --> 44:45.519
- Did you?
- The drowned.

44:47.646 --> 44:55.571
seen as holding the guard
his head under the water ...

44:56.697 --> 44:58.282
on the River.

44:59.700 --> 45:03.079
she struggled and cried ....

45:04.955 --> 45:07.083
but was unútil.

45:10.461 --> 45:13.339
It was always fascinating to me

45:14.590 --> 45:17.301
as supicamos for life

45:18.469 --> 45:20.972
as we struggle to survive

45:21.555 --> 45:25.810
until the last second.

45:28.396 --> 45:32.483
I grabbed her and pushed her.

45:34.819 --> 45:39.281
I could feel her nails driven into my skin.

45:39.615 --> 45:41.784
There was something in it.

45:43.869 --> 45:48.249
his will to live
I stopped.

46:41.427 --> 46:44.388
They captured me and brought me here.

46:47.141 --> 46:48.517
Did they kill the soldier?

46:50.394 --> 46:55.900
No, they put in front
of the following between battles.

46:57.985 --> 47:00.154
Gerrard was great.

47:01.405 --> 47:03.407
They could not kill.

47:04.784 --> 47:07.161
He defected from the army.

47:07.828 --> 47:12.041
The last I heard was that
was in the forest

47:13.167 --> 47:19.298
killing a wild animal.

47:21.801 --> 47:24.220
It is not difficult to imagine
that destination

47:26.847 --> 47:30.351
The gods have a sense
peculiar mood.

47:35.523 --> 47:41.279
If I die ...
before you wake ...

47:43.447 --> 47:45.408
we will meet again.

47:45.658 --> 47:47.785
Then say goodbye.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.586
- We were lucky.
- Yes

47:59.755 --> 48:01.132
How much longer?

48:01.757 --> 48:03.426
Do not want to know.

48:03.926 --> 48:05.094
Dime.

48:06.512 --> 48:08.389
We're halfway.

48:09.432 --> 48:10.766
Halfway.

48:12.268 --> 48:14.604
Crossed the river, valley

48:15.271 --> 48:18.941
and we are increasingly
closer to the king's castle.

48:19.442 --> 48:21.944
I never imagined we'd get this far.

48:23.696 --> 48:25.573
Are you sure you want to continue?

48:25.740 --> 48:28.242
Yeah, right.
I have to rescue my hrmano.

48:31.913 --> 48:34.832
Sounds like a good plan Macnus.

48:36.209 --> 48:38.461
Not too smart

48:39.587 --> 48:41.589
maybe you should consider.

48:44.842 --> 48:47.136
I'd rather die for something

48:47.428 --> 48:50.890
to spend my life hidden
thought had happened.

48:51.724 --> 48:56.729
Well, your people expect from
you were a child, what is the difference?

48:58.064 --> 49:00.274
You have a choice.

49:04.237 --> 49:06.739
You are young,
is good to be young.

49:08.032 --> 49:10.368
When you realize envejezes

49:10.576 --> 49:12.078
As you do not know.

49:15.790 --> 49:17.875
I know what a sad man
when I see one.

49:18.501 --> 49:20.253
Nonsense.

49:20.711 --> 49:22.171
Where is your family.

49:24.298 --> 49:26.926
I told you not talk about that.

49:31.305 --> 49:35.268
I did not want to bother.
Let us continue.

49:44.235 --> 49:46.988
We are on earth
of our ancestors,

49:47.697 --> 49:49.824
we pride ourselves

49:49.991 --> 49:52.869
to return to them,
one of their own,

49:53.202 --> 49:55.788
a fair Gerrard,

49:56.622 --> 49:58.207
a dear friend.

50:05.798 --> 50:09.302
Our sister returns
you,

50:10.178 --> 50:13.306
large, the gods

50:13.806 --> 50:18.352
no fear
because our time will come too

50:19.103 --> 50:22.273
and participate in the transition

50:22.940 --> 50:26.402
from this life to the next.

50:32.867 --> 50:34.327
The circle of life.

50:53.971 --> 50:57.517
Sister,
we will meet again.

51:03.481 --> 51:07.026
We believe in the prophecy
Now more than ever.

51:07.401 --> 51:10.196
The death of my sister
was not in vain!

51:31.175 --> 51:34.595
A servant charity hungry couple.

51:35.054 --> 51:36.806
I'll read your hand

51:37.014 --> 51:40.810
I will tell you they say the gods.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.062
I have no money woman.

51:45.273 --> 51:49.360
Nothing at all?
- Not at all.

51:49.986 --> 51:52.280
My sincerest apologies.

51:54.866 --> 52:00.329
There is an energy that comes
inside you.

52:00.705 --> 52:02.331
Come, come.

52:02.498 --> 52:05.460
Back!
- Wait.

52:05.793 --> 52:09.255
Ven.
- Rewind.

52:29.776 --> 52:33.821
The men met their fate.

52:34.113 --> 52:37.116
It is the chain of the universe.

52:37.450 --> 52:39.243
Gerrard's powerful.

52:42.955 --> 52:45.333
Please explain.

52:45.541 --> 52:48.419
How long will lose
With this crazy? Come on.

52:50.630 --> 52:52.632
We fool.

53:00.014 --> 53:03.059
Any progress?

53:05.937 --> 53:07.438
My king

53:08.356 --> 53:10.775
I stand before you in shame.

53:11.818 --> 53:16.280
I could not accomplish the mission
ordered by my lord.

53:17.323 --> 53:20.827
Why did not you?

53:21.577 --> 53:24.163
He hides in the forest lord.

53:27.208 --> 53:29.210
Is not the king's army capable

53:29.377 --> 53:31.587
to find a boy?

53:32.630 --> 53:37.176
I promise you with my hands
save his throne

53:38.177 --> 53:43.766
I will not sleep until the completion of the mission.

53:43.891 --> 53:47.353
Find the one in the cell,

53:47.520 --> 53:50.064
take you to the chosen

53:50.231 --> 53:52.442
and if not, kill him!

53:53.067 --> 53:54.986
What's wrong with that?!

53:55.236 --> 53:57.739
It is my duty and an honor for me.

53:57.905 --> 53:59.449
Shut up and do it!

54:03.661 --> 54:05.663
I will fight for you my king.

54:10.001 --> 54:11.461
Come here.

54:14.088 --> 54:18.301
Do you see the dedication?

54:19.802 --> 54:21.512
Value?

54:22.597 --> 54:24.891
I will make an army of children.

54:26.059 --> 54:28.436
That's not a bad idea.

54:28.644 --> 54:31.981
Take him to the barracks
and begin training.

54:34.567 --> 54:36.444
Please sir, no.

54:36.694 --> 54:38.279
Will I be challenged?

54:40.740 --> 54:42.617
An army of angry mothers.

54:43.409 --> 54:45.578
At the barracks, who trains.

54:48.122 --> 54:51.000
This is modern, progressive ...

54:51.584 --> 54:56.422
and I do not know what to say.

55:52.186 --> 55:56.441
Cowards!
Cowards!

56:11.247 --> 56:14.334
I needed that.

56:17.754 --> 56:21.925
I saw the most beautiful thing in the world.

56:22.592 --> 56:24.636
I know what you mean.

56:26.095 --> 56:29.933
Nothing like spring
in the forest.

56:38.191 --> 56:39.901
I take that back.

56:43.321 --> 56:45.281
I think I saw anything more beautiful.

56:46.908 --> 56:52.121
Calm down, do not invade
privacy ...

56:52.288 --> 56:53.748
Speak for yourself.

57:08.096 --> 57:11.808
Oh, the gods have bewitched me princess.

57:12.850 --> 57:14.519
I have hidden a treasure

57:14.811 --> 57:17.564
in deeper ways of my being.

57:19.399 --> 57:20.942
I live for you

57:21.609 --> 57:23.653
breathe for you,

57:24.237 --> 57:28.575
and pray for you,
the dream of the gods

57:29.742 --> 57:32.662
only have eyes for me.

57:37.917 --> 57:39.460
My name is Magnus.

57:42.839 --> 57:44.799
That was very eloquent Macnus.

57:46.467 --> 57:48.761
I see you are similiano.

57:49.137 --> 57:50.638
From which family?

57:51.639 --> 57:53.725
Magnus I Almirance.

57:53.892 --> 57:55.310
I am the grandson of the great king.

58:01.441 --> 58:03.568
Okay Magnus
has told the truth.

58:04.402 --> 58:07.197
Just tell the truth,
I am noble.

58:13.453 --> 58:16.664
I'm Aria, daughter of Andrade.

58:18.917 --> 58:21.002
My sincerest apologies princess.

58:21.920 --> 58:24.297
I thought it was just a legend.

58:27.133 --> 58:29.469
He lived in exile
all my life.

58:30.261 --> 58:33.389
And now came
to look for the deliverer.

58:33.515 --> 58:36.351
is here
we will find.

58:37.352 --> 58:38.728
Come with us.

58:39.938 --> 58:42.065
We would be very helpful.

58:42.440 --> 58:43.691
Would they?

58:45.693 --> 58:48.404
I love princess.

58:48.571 --> 58:50.698
But I must rescue my brother
the power of the king

58:50.865 --> 58:52.742
and avenge the death of my father.

58:53.826 --> 58:55.620
I can not turn away from my mission.

58:55.870 --> 58:57.247
He waits.

58:58.581 --> 58:59.874
I understand.

59:01.149 --> 59:04.569
It hurts that can not
Princess help.

59:06.280 --> 59:08.991
Revenge is to burn
a fire in your soul

59:09.284 --> 59:11.411
will consume any reason.

59:12.622 --> 59:14.206
Good luck with your mission.

59:14.624 --> 59:16.167
and that the gods protect you.

59:19.629 --> 59:20.797
Thanks.

59:26.429 --> 59:29.934
The pain in his heart
will lead to premature death.

59:31.351 --> 59:33.813
He is, there it is,

59:34.439 --> 59:37.900
Chosen, there it is.
- Show me!

59:38.026 --> 59:41.114
Magnus, here goes.

59:50.749 --> 59:52.043
Is it true?

59:54.796 --> 59:57.591
No, this creature knows nothing.

59:58.802 --> 01:00:00.302
You are the deliverer.

01:00:01.513 --> 01:00:03.141
Makes sense.

01:00:03.598 --> 01:00:06.352
I'm just a Rookery,
This is nonsense.

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.816
The legend tells of a sword.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.317
That's what history says.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.113
Perhaps we can continue
and end this nonsense.

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:19.660
I'm not elected.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.795
I heard a lot of your father
and your grandfather.

01:01:04.462 --> 01:01:06.216
Your family is distinguished.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.176
Not so distinguished as his princess.

01:01:10.969 --> 01:01:13.014
Please tell me Aria.

01:01:13.598 --> 01:01:15.184
I can not.

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:18.729
Is an order of the princess.

01:01:20.356 --> 01:01:22.191
Aria will be then.

01:01:23.819 --> 01:01:26.989
In reality you should be my king.

01:01:27.573 --> 01:01:29.909
And I should not be your princess.

01:01:30.159 --> 01:01:32.328
Yes, I know the story.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.958
My grandfather died in battle

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:40.506
and my father
your father loved so much

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:45.053
happened to him the kingdom.

01:01:46.388 --> 01:01:49.766
Yes, I guess I was smart.

01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:52.185
He wanted a simple life

01:01:52.437 --> 01:01:54.689
with animals, with you.

01:01:55.439 --> 01:01:57.317
He was a small man.

01:01:57.524 --> 01:01:59.402
He was intelligent but
far from being a king.

01:02:03.866 --> 01:02:06.036
Your father was a fierce Gerrard.

01:02:06.704 --> 01:02:09.624
Killed 10 men at once,
but he was compassionate.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:13.045
Similiano wanted the house as his son.

01:02:13.627 --> 01:02:15.882
You talk as if you knew him.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.136
My father told me stories
about it ...

01:02:19.719 --> 01:02:21.429
at bedtime.

01:02:23.182 --> 01:02:25.851
I feel that I met him
and well.

01:02:29.064 --> 01:02:31.067
I remember his voice.

01:02:32.692 --> 01:02:35.320
I was very young when he was executed.

01:02:36.196 --> 01:02:38.115
But I remember his voice.

01:02:39.785 --> 01:02:41.704
What?

01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:45.332
He asked my mother:

01:02:46.084 --> 01:02:48.087
Where's my food?

01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:52.132
It was not what he expected to hear.

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:55.971
Yes, a funny memory.

01:02:58.472 --> 01:03:02.061
Everyone likes food.

01:03:03.604 --> 01:03:05.189
It was a great man.

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:15.536
I look for more wood.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.610
Over there!

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.873
Is it true?

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.793
Are you the one?

01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:35.381
Yes I am.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.720
If your son had a
would be queen, right?

01:04:43.556 --> 01:04:45.558
I think so.

01:04:51.357 --> 01:04:54.278
Would you like to be your queen?

01:04:56.823 --> 01:04:59.367
I can make your dreams come true.

01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:07.460
You better come down.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.383
Fake, if you were the chosen
I would take now.

01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:16.555
This man is a phony!

01:05:16.804 --> 01:05:19.141
I have suggested
in the middle of the night!

01:05:19.725 --> 01:05:22.979
I stood here long
enough to hear your story.

01:05:24.315 --> 01:05:27.735
I know since childhood
What you believe in it?

01:05:30.613 --> 01:05:32.782
I wish death to them.

01:06:25.095 --> 01:06:26.845
We're getting closer.

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:24.415
Old friend, stay with us.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:30.964
It took 130 years here waiting,

01:07:32.467 --> 01:07:37.055
now it's here
I can get on track.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.894
Gydro No, you must stay,

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:43.563
need your powers.

01:07:45.439 --> 01:07:47.734
It'll be alright.

01:07:48.318 --> 01:07:51.197
The prophecy is already underway.

01:07:53.075 --> 01:07:55.743
I would like to see the day,

01:07:56.453 --> 01:08:01.417
but I'm tired
very tired.

01:08:04.253 --> 01:08:05.754
Well then.

01:08:06.505 --> 01:08:08.674
Advised my father

01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:11.385
and you were loyal to the similianos,

01:08:12.344 --> 01:08:14.346
deserve a rest.

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:19.852
The gods will receive
with open arms.

01:08:21.145 --> 01:08:24.648
I must say one last thing.

01:08:26.191 --> 01:08:30.446
Go, do not stop.

01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:34.742
Degree, the king's army
is behind you.

01:08:36.035 --> 01:08:39.787
No cejes,
fulfill your destiny.

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:44.835
Why only one unit
why not the whole army?

01:08:50.174 --> 01:08:52.343
Degree, it is unknown,

01:08:52.509 --> 01:08:55.136
is worse than the whole army.

01:08:55.804 --> 01:09:00.225
It is very fast,
and appears when least expected.

01:09:01.018 --> 01:09:04.520
Stay alert.

01:09:06.273 --> 01:09:09.443
Go .... now.

01:09:13.072 --> 01:09:16.158
We will not be far away from you.

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.919
My heart is full of sadness,

01:09:28.212 --> 01:09:30.965
but also excited
so it's going to happen.

01:09:36.303 --> 01:09:38.055
No time for sadness,

01:09:39.264 --> 01:09:41.892
must continue
to fulfill our destiny.

01:09:43.352 --> 01:09:45.104
I will lead the march.

01:09:49.608 --> 01:09:54.113
Down with the King Laypach!

01:10:12.172 --> 01:10:14.425
A bitch similiana,

01:10:15.426 --> 01:10:17.636
Why leave the dog behind?

01:10:18.887 --> 01:10:20.431
Water, please.

01:10:20.889 --> 01:10:23.142
Not until you tell me where folks are.

01:10:24.059 --> 01:10:26.687
They camped near here last night

01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:31.233
Siber in the valley,

01:10:33.152 --> 01:10:35.905
are seeking the stone
the prophecy says.

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.536
More

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.414
I do not trust you bitch.

01:10:46.081 --> 01:10:48.208
Why betray
so easily?

01:10:50.294 --> 01:10:55.007
Sheefa My friend was murdered

01:10:56.926 --> 01:11:00.846
I have served the Princesa
since I was a girl

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:08.145
and she never treated me
like a sister.

01:11:12.775 --> 01:11:17.363
Soldiers, "take the dog.

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:21.784
Make sure
being eaten by dogs.

01:11:22.326 --> 01:11:24.036
You're a liar!

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.581
I'd rather be a liar or a traitor.

01:11:33.254 --> 01:11:38.092
Cursed be the name of the king.

01:11:38.425 --> 01:11:43.347
Come and kill me!

01:11:45.182 --> 01:11:48.185
I challenge you to come!

01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:29.518
There.

01:12:33.731 --> 01:12:35.566
Hurry, do not have much time.

01:12:37.193 --> 01:12:39.695
Go.

01:12:44.658 --> 01:12:48.746
Stop in the name of King Laypach.

01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:51.790
Stay with the princess.

01:14:07.616 --> 01:14:08.951
Well done.

01:14:52.578 --> 01:14:54.914
Today ... die.

01:15:06.383 --> 01:15:08.969
Not a match for Grado.

01:15:25.861 --> 01:15:30.199
.. You must do something.

01:15:31.784 --> 01:15:35.204
.. A powerful Gerrard.
- Meet your destination.

01:17:14.261 --> 01:17:16.138
Will you make me your queen?

01:17:21.018 --> 01:17:24.814
Oh, I asked the gods for you,
princess

01:17:25.523 --> 01:17:28.859
behind hidden treasure
in the depths of my being.

01:17:29.777 --> 01:17:31.487
I live for you

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:33.739
breathe for you

01:17:33.948 --> 01:17:38.703
and pray to the gods

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.207
for your eyes only
I see myself

01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:55.261
That sounds familiar.

01:17:55.928 --> 01:17:57.555
Did you write it yourself?

01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:01.142
- Sure.
- Yes?
