WEBVTT

01:05.315 --> 01:07.066
Where am I?

01:54.490 --> 01:56.491
Reconsider your answer

01:56.658 --> 01:59.368
or be excluded
from the games forever.

02:28.607 --> 02:31.359
This is not the time.
Let us not broach the subject again.

02:31.527 --> 02:35.071
Quintus, why are you from bed?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.698
The medicus gave plain instruction
you are to rest.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.702
A week upon my back
sees advice well-heeded.

02:41.870 --> 02:46.249
More, and even my cock
will cease knowing how to stand.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.875
His spirit returns.

02:48.043 --> 02:52.255
I am not a babe new dropped
from fucking womb.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.966
- See meat and wine set out.
- Yes, Domina.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.386
I always follow the wine.

02:58.554 --> 03:03.307
Your wounds... they
are less gruesome.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.435
Has she not yet found
some fool's bed to fall to yet?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.938
Or is her sole intent in Capua
to drink us dry?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.773
She has been of great comfort.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.234
And seeks the word for herself.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.446
Who do you think dried my tears
when my husband was returned to me

03:17.614 --> 03:20.658
bloodied and broken,
his life in question?

03:20.826 --> 03:22.827
I live

03:22.995 --> 03:26.247
and continue thoughts
towards doing so.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.749
I would not see my injuries
wound you as well.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.844
Oh, it's a balm
to see you on your feet.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.767
You're going to speak
to the magistrate about this?

03:46.935 --> 03:48.352
Towards what end?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.146
Quintus.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.231
He is a puppet.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.483
What redress would Sextus offer,

03:54.651 --> 03:57.904
when the man who grieved me
holds his strings?

03:58.071 --> 04:01.699
Tullius has always
been a favored son of Capua.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.952
I cannot believe he would be capable
of doing such a thing.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.540
A man of ambition
is capable of anything.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.670
My dealings with the magistrate
take precedence tomorrow.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.005
I would have you greet Varus
in my stead.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.800
The honor would be mine.
The man pisses wine and shits gold.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.054
Varus is but a stream
leading to an ocean of coin...

04:23.221 --> 04:25.973
one I would see break wave
upon our steps.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.683
He comes to choose men?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.810
For the games of the Vinalia,

04:29.978 --> 04:32.939
to ensure his vines bear fruit
in the coming year.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.775
I will present
only our finest gladiators.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.113
I would enrich our stock

04:41.281 --> 04:43.741
and offer him Gannicus as well.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.703
This had best be
the Falernian promised.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.039
If I find you've served
your usual swill,

04:50.207 --> 04:52.124
we will have words.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.001
Put mind to ease.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.962
Tullius.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.089
Note sun and mountains
etched in the amphora...

04:58.256 --> 05:00.216
proof of its authenticity.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.676
Yes, of course.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.513
I was unaware you had an appreciation
for such tastes, Solonius.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.225
A gift for a friend
recovering from unfortunate injury.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.894
Please.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.729
Allow me.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.066
Generous but unnecessary.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.151
I believe it is.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.324
I've done nothing to deserve it.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.369
A matter shortly to be rectified.

05:28.537 --> 05:32.665
Come, I would discuss message
to be delivered with our gift,

05:32.833 --> 05:35.167
better received from your tongue
than mine.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.814
The Gaul is quite the beast.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.442
What name does he take?

06:41.610 --> 06:44.278
Apologies. I do not know.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.155
His name is Crixus.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.574
He trains
in the style of murmillo.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.494
You have an interest
in the games

06:51.661 --> 06:54.622
or does it land only upon the men
who play them?

06:57.334 --> 07:00.336
So easily made to blush...

07:00.504 --> 07:03.130
a sign of tragic inexperience.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.216
I have not turned such a color

07:05.383 --> 07:07.301
since before you were born.

07:07.469 --> 07:11.388
How I envy your youth

07:11.556 --> 07:15.351
and all the wonders
you have yet to discover.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.394
Do not be afraid to pursue

07:17.562 --> 07:19.855
every delight
this world has to offer.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.774
Melitta cautions patience.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.152
Plucking flowers too quickly
will bruise the petals.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.029
Words from a mouth

07:27.197 --> 07:29.698
that has only known
her husband's cock.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.430
You charge like a crazed goat,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.975
absent thought.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.479
When faced
with stronger opponent,

08:00.647 --> 08:05.067
draw him to you, then counter.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.070
Again.

08:30.969 --> 08:35.264
Finally words find way
through thick skull.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.977
Crixus, join the recruits.
Continue your training.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.770
Yes, Doctore.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.611
The mighty Gaul returns.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.072
Or is it his corpse,
too stubborn to fall to grass?

08:54.743 --> 08:58.829
Ah, Dagan expresses his joy
at finding you yet among us.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.665
We feared you were fated
for the mines,

09:01.833 --> 09:03.667
with all the sand
you have been eating.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.964
An acquired taste.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.426
Come, I should serve you
some more.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.186
You've done well with the man.

09:22.354 --> 09:26.357
Crixus is undisciplined
but not without promise.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.901
He brings to thought
a wild fuck I schooled

09:29.069 --> 09:31.445
when we yet called
Batiatus's father Dominus.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.073
I yet feel
the sting of your lessons,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.951
their knowledge now bestowed
upon simple recruits.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.828
I will seek word with Batiatus

09:39.996 --> 09:41.914
towards your return
to the arena.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.751
- Gratitude, Doctore.
- Close fucking mouth.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.003
I but seek not to have wasted
long years

09:48.171 --> 09:49.922
of pulling your head
from your ass.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.104
Doctore,

10:05.272 --> 10:06.981
I require
a more worthy opponent...

10:07.148 --> 10:09.900
perhaps if Oenomaus is finished
sipping drink?

10:11.194 --> 10:14.196
Instruct Gannicus in the ways
of a true champion.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.261
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

10:55.071 --> 10:58.532
Do you recall Magnetius
when he fought Trux of the East?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.540
A glorious victory.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.084
For my father.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.921
Hadrianus...

11:17.302 --> 11:19.303
Acerbitas...

11:22.265 --> 11:24.266
Dolor...

11:28.646 --> 11:30.647
Zephyros...

11:37.989 --> 11:40.074
my father's champions,

11:40.241 --> 11:42.618
my grandfather's champions,

11:42.786 --> 11:45.662
the storied history
of the House of Batiatus.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.750
With new chapters
yet to be added.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.294
Etched upon what tablet?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.296
I'm excluded from the games.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.965
Or have such details slipped
memory's grasp?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.134
Apologies. I did not mean...

12:00.595 --> 12:03.055
Fault is mine for baring teeth
at trusted friend.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.767
Gratitude for the gift.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.311
It's well received.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.231
I claim only its delivery.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.193
He's willing to see
his bid for Gannicus doubled.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.488
If accepted, he will grant your men
strong position

12:19.656 --> 12:21.865
in the upcoming games
of the Vinalia.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.575
This wine is from Tullius?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.536
I did not seek him out.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.955
He approached me
in the marketplace,

12:28.123 --> 12:30.124
expressing regret
that his business with you

12:30.291 --> 12:32.000
turned to excess.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.336
He even paid for the wine
that I'd selected for you...

12:34.504 --> 12:36.338
a gesture of goodwill.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.258
- Do you see these marks upon me?
- We must consider...

12:39.426 --> 12:43.178
- Do you fucking see them?
- I see them.

12:43.346 --> 12:47.182
That is the man's true gesture,
the only to be considered.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.229
You counsel to suck the cock
that pisses on me!

12:52.397 --> 12:55.691
I merely counsel reason,
as your father would.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.527
To what purpose?

12:58.695 --> 13:03.157
He brings word and gift
from Tullius,

13:03.324 --> 13:06.160
who yet seeks Gannicus
to swell his ranks.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.120
After what he
fucking did to you?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.748
Well, let us sweep aside
such petty grievances

13:11.916 --> 13:14.835
in service of reason and reward.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.963
He offers twice the sum refused.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.343
And what, I wonder,
does good Solonius receive

13:23.511 --> 13:25.721
for convincing me
to spread cheeks

13:25.889 --> 13:27.890
and accept deeper ramming?

13:28.057 --> 13:30.350
I would share equal position
in the games.

13:30.518 --> 13:34.229
Oh, you are in remarkable condition
to claim my reflection.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.357
Our fates move
towards similar end,

13:37.525 --> 13:39.443
despite outward appearance.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.904
Refuse Tullius's offer,

13:42.071 --> 13:44.072
and I shall join you
in exclusion from the arena.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.699
He makes such a threat?

13:45.867 --> 13:48.076
With exacting clarity.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.874
I did not mean
to see you burdened so.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.294
I will think upon the matter.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.254
Tullius requires answer.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.382
I require a fucking moment!

14:04.260 --> 14:07.930
He wishes to present your man
to Quintilius Varus tomorrow.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.849
Varus? He comes to Capua?

14:11.017 --> 14:14.144
Vettius is to meet him
as he enters the city midday.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.689
I held his acquaintance in Rome...
a man of great influence

14:17.857 --> 14:19.233
and coin.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.735
You would beg
for Tullius' scraps?

14:21.903 --> 14:25.322
Without them, I fear
we shall both go hungry.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.032
Think upon it.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.201
And know that I stand with you,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.787
whatever your decision.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.584
I have witnessed greater spine
within a snail.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.965
What are your thoughts?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.935
Doctore!

14:55.103 --> 14:58.397
Send that fucking man
to the mines.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.400
Do it!

15:06.114 --> 15:07.906
No, Doctore.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.493
No, please, Doctore.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.161
Dominus!

15:13.329 --> 15:16.999
We do not surrender
in this fucking house!

15:17.166 --> 15:20.794
I will see these walls fall to ruin
before missio is given!

15:22.338 --> 15:24.756
It appears decision is made.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.849
Gannicus will one day stand
the Champion of Capua

15:34.017 --> 15:35.976
for the House of Batiatus.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.812
How do we manage such honor
if excluded from the games?

15:45.153 --> 15:47.696
Tullius but brokers interest.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.741
If a man of wealth and position
such as Varus requested my men,

15:50.908 --> 15:52.993
even he would be
unable to refuse.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.911
He meets with Vettius.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.581
You expect that fucking child
to make introduction?

15:57.749 --> 16:00.500
No, I expect him to bleed

16:00.668 --> 16:03.128
as I rip Varus from his grasp.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.265
Halt!

16:16.643 --> 16:18.393
Rest.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.022
Eat.

16:33.409 --> 16:37.746
Ah, your numbers shrink
like frightened cock.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.685
A man is condemned to the mines
and they all fucking jest.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.271
If it were a brother lost,
you would find the mood solemn.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.652
We must earn the fucking mark
to gain respect...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.739
or follow Indus to his fate.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.660
I will not die a faceless slave,
forgotten by history.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.579
We shall rise together.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.374
One day all the Republic

17:22.541 --> 17:24.917
will marvel at the sight of us.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.303
Fucking savages.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.559
They pissed in the porridge.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.618
I have had my fill.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.456
Oh, finally someone who can
hold their wine.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.458
I did not realize
we were for company.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.543
He leaves presently.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.212
Oh please,
after we have finished the jug...

18:09.380 --> 18:13.216
the last of my spoils to be shared
with dearest of friends.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.595
Replace "dearest" with "only"
and sentiment becomes truth.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.431
Settle argument... who was the better man
as we sparred today?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.767
- My husband.
- Ha.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.935
You are swayed
by the title of wife.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.980
One day we shall face each other
upon the sand

18:27.148 --> 18:29.024
and have true decision.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.193
What would really happen

18:31.360 --> 18:33.820
if you had to face each other
sine missione,

18:33.988 --> 18:36.031
no quarter given,
no mercy shown?

18:36.199 --> 18:38.742
I would give your husband
a glorious death.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.286
You joke of killing
a man you love

18:41.454 --> 18:44.039
when someday
you may be asked to.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.167
Oh, you two are a perfect match,
are you not...

18:47.335 --> 18:50.879
both always fretting about
what tomorrow may bring?

18:51.047 --> 18:52.589
We are slaves,

18:52.757 --> 18:55.926
burden of choice and conscience
equally removed.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.429
We are truly free when we fight

18:59.597 --> 19:03.475
or when we fuck, which I shall leave
to do presently.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.394
It is you and my husband
who are of a perfect match...

19:06.562 --> 19:09.481
one hides true thought
in brooding silence,

19:09.649 --> 19:13.527
the other in boastful jest
meant to hold all at a fair distance.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.404
- Melitta.
- I do not hold you at a distance.

19:16.572 --> 19:20.534
You are my two favorite women
in this world.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.619
And what happens,
brave Gannicus,

19:22.787 --> 19:24.579
when presented with circumstance

19:24.747 --> 19:26.957
you cannot laugh
or fight your way clear of?

19:29.126 --> 19:33.630
Well, I may have to
fuck my way clear of it.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.925
Good night.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.780
Gannicus.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.949
Never come up upon my back!

20:01.117 --> 20:02.450
Apologies.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.620
I seek only advice
for coming days.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.958
Heed Oenomaus's instruction...

20:10.126 --> 20:12.002
you will earn your brand.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.963
Till then you stay from sight.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.509
It is not the brand
that concerns me.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.221
It is becoming champion.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.767
There is only one way
to become champion...

20:29.395 --> 20:32.188
never fucking lose.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.573
See Barca readied.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.909
He is to accompany me
to the city.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.244
Another stunt in the market?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.164
Does my last bodyguard's death
fucking elude?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.499
Barca is to serve as such?
He is a gladiator, not...

20:51.667 --> 20:53.668
He is whatever I fucking say.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.879
Have the Syrians also prepared,

20:56.047 --> 20:57.839
absent shackles
and clothed for the streets.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.884
Ashur, Dagan?
What use do you see them to?

21:01.052 --> 21:02.552
None of your concern.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.429
With respect, Dominus,
I am the doctore.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.972
The men are my only concern.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.934
A duty awarded you by my father.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.019
A man who would not condemn
a promising recruit

21:11.187 --> 21:13.021
to the mines out of a mood.

21:13.189 --> 21:17.859
Recruits, gladiators,
even you are but slaves,

21:18.027 --> 21:21.196
mine to command
despite my fucking moods.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.535
You truly believe this man
ripe with potential?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.664
Indus will never be champion,

21:30.831 --> 21:33.959
but he is not without skill.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.044
Have him loaded
with the Syrians.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.213
I will give him opportunity
to prove his worth.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.257
Dominus.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.555
Has Venus herself ever appeared

21:47.723 --> 21:49.849
in such rare form?

21:50.017 --> 21:51.393
You blaspheme.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.062
Frequently and with great relish.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.693
Where is Gaia?
The appointed hour is upon us.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.070
She stands ready.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.614
- Quintus...
- Do not give voice to doubt.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.575
We are committed
and will see this to its end.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.629
You each know your parts.

22:19.797 --> 22:23.091
See this act to successful completion
and earn the mark of the brotherhood.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.968
Without proving ourselves
in the test?

22:25.136 --> 22:27.554
This is your test.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.640
But turn thoughts toward escape
or fail in this charge,

22:30.808 --> 22:33.810
and I will have you parted
from your cocks and crucified.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.272
You're clear to your purpose?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.107
Yes, Dominus.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.112
Take up your positions
and await my signal.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.289
I do not trust the Syrians.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.833
If this does not end
in our favor,

22:57.001 --> 22:58.960
they will appear
as common thieves,

22:59.128 --> 23:02.172
absent my fucking mark upon arm.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.931
This will never work.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.976
Of course it will. Look at you.

23:15.144 --> 23:18.480
What man or otherwise
could resist such charms?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.106
Gaia.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.650
Oh, still fluttering heart.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.653
I would not deny myself such pleasures
if presented again,

23:25.821 --> 23:28.782
yet necessities
shift attention to cock,

23:28.949 --> 23:30.658
and a golden one at that.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.786
You set eyes towards Varus?

23:32.953 --> 23:36.206
He is without wife, last I heard.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.668
We do this to aid my husband,
not to secure one of your own.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.839
He arrives.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.176
Let us end discussion
and set mind to purpose.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.329
Good Vettius,
thank the gods I have found you.

24:16.497 --> 24:19.040
Your gratitude is misplaced.
I do not know you.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.542
I am Varus's man.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.836
He sends word of pressing desire
to see the new arena

24:23.003 --> 24:25.380
before retiring to business.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.757
The arena? No.

24:27.925 --> 24:31.094
I am of clear instruction to meet him
as he enters the city.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.972
Of course. Apologies.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.683
I will deliver word
of your refusal.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.061
Wait.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.315
Varus is honored guest.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.901
As such, I am
but humble servant.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.038
It's quicker, I think,
if we pass through here.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.499
Apologies for the inconvenience.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.586
Dominus will be most pleased
that you've accompanied me.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.629
You've turned yourself about.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.798
This is not the direction
of the fucking arena.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.093
No.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.512
It is not.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.421
No.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.676
We are to leave this one alive,

25:53.844 --> 25:55.845
you simple fuck.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.164
Our charge is met.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.124
I will not see the mines.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.670
I fear they would have been
a blessing.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.508
Apologies, brother.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.677
Vettius saw your face.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.471
Dominus gave instruction.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.459
Where the fuck is Vettius?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.503
Quintilius.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.089
It is you.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.718
Gaia. What finds you
in such horrid climes?

27:16.885 --> 27:19.178
A visit to see dearest friend.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.265
Lucretia.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.434
Lucretia and
her husband Batiatus

27:24.601 --> 27:27.562
are the saving grace
of this ill-bred town.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.689
This is Quintilius Varus,

27:29.857 --> 27:32.442
an acquaintance
of my late husband.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.819
His wine is the toast of Rome.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.696
Your tongue has lost
none of its silver.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.531
It's an honor.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.575
And what good fortune blesses Capua
with your presence?

27:40.743 --> 27:42.660
I come to choose gladiators
for the Vinalia,

27:42.828 --> 27:46.289
or would, if young Vettius
ever deigns to appear.

27:47.333 --> 27:51.502
We shall entertain you with
diverting conversation while you wait.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.421
I fear it shall be
tragically one-sided.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.214
The sun threatens
to bake me senseless.

27:55.382 --> 27:59.260
We cannot have such esteemed guest
expire so, can we?

27:59.428 --> 28:01.763
Well, my husband's villa
is but a little ways from here.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.514
You'd be more than welcome to...

28:03.682 --> 28:06.309
Gratitude, but I would
seek Vettius out

28:06.477 --> 28:09.562
and put foot to ass for his delay.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.273
Lucretia's slaves know the man.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.400
It would be just as easy
for them

28:14.568 --> 28:16.944
to bring him to her villa
when discovered

28:17.112 --> 28:20.740
and give us much needed pause
to reacquaint ourselves.

28:20.908 --> 28:23.409
Well, it would be ungrateful

28:23.577 --> 28:26.412
to refuse such kind offering.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.663
Your villa then.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.041
My husband will be most pleased
to receive you.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.711
What good fortune
to run into you.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.478
The last time I was graced
with Gaia's presence

28:50.646 --> 28:52.814
was at some sober,
airless affair

28:52.981 --> 28:55.358
hosted by...
oh, what was the man's name?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.485
- Atticus.
- Atticus, yes.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.487
Desiccated specimen.

28:59.655 --> 29:02.657
I fear without Gaia's charms,
pronounced boredom

29:02.825 --> 29:05.076
would have carried me to the afterlife
that very night.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.038
Oh, my husband returns.
Fetch more wine.

29:09.206 --> 29:12.333
Lucretia, apologies.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.836
I did not realize
we were to entertain.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.255
An unexpected pleasure
chanced upon in the city.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.008
Quintilius Varus...
an old friend from Rome.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.178
Ah, the name is not unfamiliar.
You honor us with your presence.

29:24.346 --> 29:28.015
The honor is mine, to fall upon
such warm hospitality.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.852
Ah, forgive unsightly
countenance.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.272
A mount long trusted
threw me from purchase.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.649
One must be cautious
when dealing with such animals.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.152
Yeah, a lesson painfully learned.

29:39.319 --> 29:42.905
What finds you so far from Rome?

29:43.073 --> 29:45.408
Games of the Vinalia.

29:45.576 --> 29:46.993
You come to choose men?

29:47.161 --> 29:50.246
I have many fine offerings...
Gannicus in particular.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.915
Apologies. You are a Lanista?

29:53.083 --> 29:56.919
Oh, he has already set purpose
towards Vettius' men.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.172
Ah, well,

29:59.339 --> 30:01.215
fill cup and strike ill-spoken word
from mind.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.510
A thing of no concern.
Vettius will see you well attended.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.054
At considerable savings.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.766
Do I appear so light of purse
to require such?

30:10.934 --> 30:14.729
You have never been so taken
with the games.

30:14.897 --> 30:18.316
I only assumed you would not waste
excessive coin towards them.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.194
True, yet the gods
must be properly honored

30:21.361 --> 30:24.030
and Vettius remains
annoyingly absent.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.241
Your men...

30:27.409 --> 30:30.161
how stand they
in comparison to the boy's?

30:30.329 --> 30:33.414
Well, I would not speak ill
of a brother Lanista.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.791
You are too modest.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.170
Vettius offers shit.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.215
I was told by good Tullius
that his stable is well stocked.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.510
The boy chooses gladiators
as carelessly as his wine...

30:45.677 --> 30:49.263
high quantity
of the lowest quality.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.433
Come, let us sample
a finer vintage.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.188
Please.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.702
Doctore.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.958
Gladiators, form up.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.376
Present yourselves.

31:18.544 --> 31:22.213
Batiatus! Batiatus! Batiatus!

31:24.383 --> 31:26.300
Did I not tell you?

31:26.468 --> 31:29.595
The finest gladiators
in all of Capua.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.807
Hmm, a demonstration perhaps?

31:32.975 --> 31:34.809
Of course.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.144
Gannicus, step forward.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.982
Behold my finest champion.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.776
No man stands his equal.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.196
And who would you have face
this god of the arena?

31:47.364 --> 31:49.699
Barca perhaps or Oenomaus,
who fought so bravely?

31:49.866 --> 31:51.742
What about the Gaul?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.161
Who would not marvel
at seeing such a creature

31:54.329 --> 31:56.247
locked in mortal embrace?

31:57.833 --> 32:00.668
Crixus? Apologies.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.004
The man does not yet bear
the mark of the brotherhood.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.463
Yet he is presented.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.341
I fear such a match
would be overly brief.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.260
A blessing,
considering the heat.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.305
Well, let us move to it then.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.599
Crixus!

32:16.476 --> 32:18.853
Step forward.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.197
A fucking jest.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.575
The House of Batiatus is humbled

32:32.743 --> 32:35.786
by the attentions
of Quintilius Varus.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.540
Let us show him
they are not unwarranted.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.252
Apologies. Are they to use
those little wooden sticks?

32:43.420 --> 32:46.631
Well, it is the tradition
when blood is not the purpose.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.008
So they are to fight
as children, not men?

32:51.219 --> 32:54.221
Why, I would not see you
to such an impression.

32:54.389 --> 32:58.059
Doctore, have wood
give way to steel.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.565
Gladius.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.873
The gods have heard you.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.793
They present opportunity
to become champion.

33:27.756 --> 33:28.923
Begin.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.856
Oenomaus has trained you well.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.405
Yet you are a pale imitation
of the man.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.043
You lie. I did no such thing.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.692
A fine attempt.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.530
Has there ever before been
such a demonstration?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.827
What say you, good Varus?

35:21.995 --> 35:23.913
Should the Gaul live or die?

35:24.080 --> 35:27.291
Well, Gaia chose the man,
let the choice be hers.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.053
Let him live.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.349
He may yet find his use.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.571
What of my man Gannicus?
Did you find him to your liking?

35:57.739 --> 36:01.784
The man is weary
from his travels.

36:01.952 --> 36:04.662
Let us not press him
with further business.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.040
Come see yourself inside

36:08.208 --> 36:11.001
to sample other indulgences.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.754
Some delights
from Cyprus perhaps?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.340
A region I'm most fond of.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.509
As I recall.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.303
What the fuck are you doing?

36:21.471 --> 36:23.430
What I do best.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.474
Varus is a man
of particular appetites

36:25.642 --> 36:30.271
which grow strong
under influence of wine and opium.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.273
See your man Gannicus
oiled and scented,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.025
to be presented
as the hour passes.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.656
I risk all to lure Varus
to our house

36:40.824 --> 36:42.904
only to find I am no longer
the fucking master of it.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.578
She knows the man
more intimately than we do.

36:45.745 --> 36:48.122
We must lend her our trust.

36:48.290 --> 36:51.542
Let us pray it is not soiled
upon return.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.845
See Gannicus prepared
and brought up to the villa.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.638
And what will be
required of him?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.640
Whatever I fucking desire.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.977
Ashur and Dagan returned absent Indus.
Did he not prove himself?

37:10.145 --> 37:12.980
He did, and was well-rewarded.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.482
And the Syrians...
are they to be rewarded as well?

37:15.650 --> 37:17.484
With the mark of the brotherhood.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.528
The mark?

37:19.696 --> 37:22.364
Without proving themselves
in the test?

37:22.532 --> 37:26.201
They proved themselves in my test.
See it done.

37:26.369 --> 37:29.413
- Your father would never approve.
- I am not my fucking father!

37:29.581 --> 37:31.498
A fact well-known.

37:31.666 --> 37:35.502
See to Gannicus,
brand the fucking Syrians

37:35.670 --> 37:37.588
and inform Oenomaus

37:37.756 --> 37:40.674
that he is to assume
mantle of doctore.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.178
Dominus.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.848
You are a relic,
as is my father...

37:48.016 --> 37:50.517
shadows from the past,

37:50.685 --> 37:53.437
soon to fade from memory.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.649
See to Gannicus.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.211
See how it caresses the wine?

38:17.379 --> 38:20.047
Is there anything so enticing?

38:20.215 --> 38:22.841
I have seen its rival.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.556
This house indeed offers
many pleasures.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.103
With more yet to be presented.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.484
Pleasing this man must now become
your sole fucking purpose.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.570
Please him? In what manner?

38:43.738 --> 38:46.532
I have had my fill of being
questioned by slaves.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.038
If Varus wishes you
to suck his cock dry,

38:53.206 --> 38:55.082
you will savor every drop.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.292
Are we of a singular mind?

38:59.254 --> 39:00.629
Dominus.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.012
In honor of distinguished guest,

39:08.179 --> 39:12.141
I present my finest man
for your personal viewing.

39:12.308 --> 39:17.438
Behold Gannicus,
yours to command.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.904
You are quite the Lanista,
Batiatus.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.366
I have never been so well-plied
towards aid of a sale.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.077
This is not about business.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.204
This is how they live.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.249
They grab life and squeeze
until the juice flows.

39:37.417 --> 39:40.794
How do you always come by
such marvelous acquaintance?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.796
It is a gift.

39:42.964 --> 39:48.343
One among many set before me.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.098
Is he not of a form...
our champion?

39:53.266 --> 39:55.476
I have not seen his like.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.979
And more than a few
have stood before me.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.231
The man stands as a god,

40:01.399 --> 40:04.359
the arena his Olympus.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.321
He once thrust a blade so deep
into an opponent's breast

40:07.489 --> 40:09.698
that tears turned to blood.

40:09.866 --> 40:13.827
I'm not impressed
by inflated tales.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.996
My interests are grounded

40:16.164 --> 40:23.337
in what I can see,
what I can touch.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.885
Now that is impressive.

40:30.887 --> 40:35.641
Are you as skilled in its use
as you are with a sword?

40:40.730 --> 40:43.398
I would have demonstration.

40:44.984 --> 40:48.195
The man is yours.
We will lend privacy.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.532
No, you mistake intent.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.201
No, I've had too much wine
and other pleasures

40:54.369 --> 40:56.370
for such rough exertion.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.873
No, I would prefer
a feast of the eyes.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.167
Oh, have him fuck this one

41:02.335 --> 41:04.670
and I shall watch.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.214
Apologies.

41:07.382 --> 41:10.342
For what? Is she not a slave?

41:11.386 --> 41:15.264
She is and will do as commanded.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.203
Welcome to the fucking
brotherhood.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.292
- Why are we gathered?
- The Syrians receive the mark.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.043
Absent the test?

41:56.723 --> 41:59.266
Wait, are we not
to recite the oath?

41:59.434 --> 42:03.228
I will not see more shit
heaped upon sacred rites.

42:06.107 --> 42:09.359
You may bear the mark, but don't
ever think yourself a gladiator,

42:09.527 --> 42:10.944
you little cunt.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.571
Doctore!

42:16.659 --> 42:19.203
Do not fucking speak to me
in such tone.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.412
Apologies.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.873
You believe yourself my equal,
Oenomaus?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.374
No, Doctore.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.919
Gladius...

42:28.546 --> 42:31.298
bring fucking swords.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.516
Now let us see
if you have learned

42:41.684 --> 42:44.561
all I have to teach.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.327
Remove her dress.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.284
Is that what I taught you,
Oenomaus...

43:40.451 --> 43:43.078
- Doctore.
- How to turn upon heel?

43:43.246 --> 43:44.663
Doctore.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.541
Doctore, stop.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.462
Fight me, you coward.

44:16.029 --> 44:19.114
- Melitta, l...
- See it done.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.001
Prove yourself worthy, Oenomaus.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.895
I taught you well.

47:14.290 --> 47:17.125
- The man is dead?
- I did not want it.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.586
He forced me to fight.

47:19.754 --> 47:22.714
And I do not know the reason
for his anger toward me.

47:27.178 --> 47:31.640
The reason falls
to my own tongue.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.433
Earlier I revealed intent

47:33.601 --> 47:35.977
of raising you
to position of doctore.

47:36.145 --> 47:39.105
I am not to return to the arena?

47:39.273 --> 47:41.650
You are beyond such things now,

47:41.817 --> 47:44.069
proven by your training
of Crixus.

47:44.237 --> 47:47.614
Let us put the past behind us
and look to future glories.

47:50.326 --> 47:55.413
My wife... I know it
is not our time,

47:55.581 --> 47:57.666
but I would ask to see her.

47:58.668 --> 48:00.877
I will send her to you
when she has finished her duties.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.046
Gratitude.

48:15.768 --> 48:19.145
Apologies. The demands
of a Lanista seldom offer respite.

48:19.313 --> 48:20.397
Oh, none required.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.692
This night has been filled
with unexpected joys.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.402
You remain in Capua?

48:25.570 --> 48:29.072
Until more adventurous
opportunities present themselves.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.824
Ahh.

48:30.992 --> 48:34.286
I'll take my leave then
with promise of further discourse.

48:37.373 --> 48:40.333
Oh, your man Gannicus...

48:40.501 --> 48:43.295
I would see him perform again

48:43.462 --> 48:46.798
in the primus of my games.

48:46.966 --> 48:48.842
And you shall have him.

48:49.010 --> 48:50.719
Terms to be discussed.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.306
Gratitude for your hospitality.
It will not soon be forgot.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.185
Primus?

48:59.353 --> 49:01.396
Did I not tell you
I knew the man?

49:01.564 --> 49:04.190
May the gods strike me
for entertaining doubt.

49:04.358 --> 49:06.026
You were magnificent.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.486
Did I not tell you?

49:08.654 --> 49:11.531
You have elevated this house.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.700
Yet speak of how we came
by such honor

49:13.868 --> 49:16.953
and see brotherhood shattered
and a husband lost.

51:50.191 --> 51:54.235
I have done a terrible thing.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.198
We do what we must
in this house.
