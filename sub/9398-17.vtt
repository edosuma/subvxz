00:00.530 --> 00:01.573
Hi, Peyton.

00:06.867 --> 00:08.995
Peyton, 8th-grade cheer camp.

00:11.728 --> 00:13.351
Now it's hoes over psychos.

00:13.451 --> 00:15.374
- You saved me.
- You saved me, too.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.720
You want to come with me?

00:16.945 --> 00:18.021
I'm coming with you.

00:18.121 --> 00:21.001
Do you think it's impossible for you
to ever have feelings for me again?

00:21.038 --> 00:22.471
It's not impossible.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.618
You lost your phone.

00:26.716 --> 00:27.570
That's not my phone.

00:27.674 --> 00:28.792
What are you doing here, Lucas?

00:28.821 --> 00:31.066
I keep feeling like Keith's
trying to tell me something.

00:31.126 --> 00:32.302
Keith's dead.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.120
Open your eyes.

00:48.775 --> 00:50.470
William Blake once wrote,

00:50.576 --> 00:52.371
"There are things
that are known

00:52.475 --> 00:54.202
"and things that are unknown.

00:56.197 --> 00:57.520
"And in between...

00:58.485 --> 01:00.090
- "there are doors."
- Hey, yo, Luke.

01:01.158 --> 01:02.991
Damn. Nice work.

01:03.095 --> 01:05.432
No. No, it's not...

01:07.485 --> 01:09.623
It's the attack last week.

01:09.728 --> 01:11.620
Neither one of them
wants to be alone.

01:13.547 --> 01:16.540
Hey, if that's your story.
Look, we got to go.

01:16.646 --> 01:18.520
- What?
- It's Mouth. He needs our help.

01:21.588 --> 01:22.953
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Mayor?

01:23.056 --> 01:24.413
Yeah. Come on in, Joe.

01:24.947 --> 01:27.413
I need you to access this
phone's calling history.

01:27.517 --> 01:29.352
Sure. Whose phone is it?

01:29.458 --> 01:31.090
That's what I want
you to find out.

01:31.376 --> 01:34.523
With all due respect,
Mr. Mayor, I can't do that.

01:34.858 --> 01:36.091
That's illegal.

01:38.387 --> 01:40.932
You got a performance review coming up,
don't you, Joe?

01:41.826 --> 01:44.592
Not to mention a sexy little thing
going on with -- what's her name?

01:44.696 --> 01:46.631
Darcy in public relations?

01:47.838 --> 01:49.012
But wait a minute.

01:49.168 --> 01:51.042
Your wife's name's Jill,
isn't it?

01:55.126 --> 01:56.861
It might take me a day or two.

01:57.255 --> 01:58.592
Works for me.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.112
Oh, and, Joe?

02:00.918 --> 02:02.693
Say hi to Darcy for me.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.591
So, it's been what, about a week
since Mouth skipped town with Rachel?

02:10.626 --> 02:12.781
Then, all of a sudden,
I get this cryptic message.

02:12.885 --> 02:14.460
Sounds like he's in trouble.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.290
Okay, what kind of message?
Like voice mail?

02:17.395 --> 02:19.381
No, a text, actually.
Check it out.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.711
"Honey Grove, Texas.
Please come. Need ass"?

02:23.815 --> 02:26.712
I was thinking he would've typed
"assistance" but his battery died.

02:26.818 --> 02:29.133
Why didn't he just write "help"?
"Need help"?

02:29.235 --> 02:30.772
Maybe he need ass.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.303
Hey.

02:33.406 --> 02:34.922
Hey, Skills said
Mouth was in trouble.

02:34.968 --> 02:36.231
Yeah, he sent this.

02:38.778 --> 02:39.912
"Need ass"?

02:40.016 --> 02:41.622
We're thinking
it's "assistance."

02:41.748 --> 02:43.953
I'm gonna find
Honey Grove online.

02:47.807 --> 02:49.542
Hey, how are they
doing since the attack?

02:49.647 --> 02:51.521
Some days are better
than the others.

02:51.627 --> 02:53.221
But it gets the worst at night.

02:53.397 --> 02:55.430
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Is Mouth okay?

02:55.536 --> 02:57.102
It doesn't sound like it.

02:58.828 --> 03:00.442
"Honey Grove, Texas.
Please come."

03:00.548 --> 03:01.740
"Need ass"?

03:02.085 --> 03:04.583
I don't get it. He left with Rachel.
Why would he need ass?

03:04.685 --> 03:05.721
- Assistance.
- Assistance.

03:05.796 --> 03:07.250
Well, if Mouth needs help,

03:07.358 --> 03:09.253
then one of us needs to go
down to Honey Grove, Texas.

03:09.287 --> 03:13.003
I think we should probably all go.
It's about 90 miles from Dallas,

03:13.105 --> 03:14.863
which is like a
20-hour car ride.

03:14.968 --> 03:16.522
Hales, I love you for caring,

03:16.628 --> 03:18.253
but you're pregnant
and we got finals.

03:18.356 --> 03:20.583
We're all graduating soon.
It could be a last hurrah.

03:20.685 --> 03:23.122
Hopefully, Mouth is okay and it
turns into a great road trip.

03:23.165 --> 03:25.683
But if not,
there's safety in numbers, right?

03:29.867 --> 03:32.450
Okay, Karen and I made sandwiches,
and I got chips and drinks,

03:32.558 --> 03:33.561
and we're all set.

03:33.665 --> 03:34.821
I brought red vines.

03:34.928 --> 03:36.990
You can't have a road
trip without red vines.

03:37.097 --> 03:39.441
I brought old yearbooks --
might give us a laugh.

03:39.545 --> 03:40.541
What did you bring, Nate?

03:40.558 --> 03:42.161
I brought Haley,
who brought the food.

03:42.268 --> 03:43.290
Brooke?

03:43.487 --> 03:46.080
I brought my hot body
and Rachel's Denali.

03:46.188 --> 03:48.593
She might have left,
but at least we have her car.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.993
Sure it's not stolen?

03:50.098 --> 03:51.971
Oh, wait.
That's just calculus exams.

03:52.075 --> 03:53.631
My girl's not a big Rachel fan.

03:53.738 --> 03:54.941
Peyton, what did you bring?

03:55.048 --> 03:56.290
Road mix.

03:57.535 --> 03:59.131
Okay, let's go.

03:59.278 --> 04:02.953
You seem rather excited, considering
Mouth might be in a lot of trouble.

04:03.057 --> 04:04.881
Well, I'm choosing to
believe that he's fine.

04:04.986 --> 04:07.911
Besides, it's Mouth. How much
trouble could he actually get into?

04:08.017 --> 04:09.330
He's probably having fun.

04:09.435 --> 04:10.642
Have fun.

05:18.596 --> 05:20.921
Okay, Brooke, freshman year.

05:21.635 --> 05:24.433
Lance Bass? Really?

05:24.536 --> 05:26.220
He was cute, okay?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.382
I'm not sure I'd go there, Hales.
Check this out.

05:28.487 --> 05:31.811
"Luke, stay cool
forever! Haley."

05:31.915 --> 05:33.663
So, what's wrong with that?

05:33.766 --> 05:35.600
You think that's bad?
Check this out.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.400
Peyton wrote to me in my
sophomore yearbook...

05:40.138 --> 05:41.100
"Peyton Sawyer."

05:41.207 --> 05:43.801
Come on!
I didn't even know you then.

05:43.905 --> 05:47.890
You know how hard I worked to
get my yearbook in front of her?

05:47.995 --> 05:49.862
And then she signs
her damn name.

05:49.965 --> 05:50.932
I was crushed.

05:51.037 --> 05:52.073
Okay, how about this one?

05:52.177 --> 05:55.812
"Lucas, you know you want me!
Taylor James."

05:56.516 --> 05:58.641
I wonder what she wrote
in Nathan's yearbook.

06:00.046 --> 06:02.802
Hey, look.
"Luke, you're a great friend.

06:03.207 --> 06:06.151
"Thanks for looking out for me.
See ya around."

06:06.877 --> 06:08.321
Who wrote that one?

06:09.947 --> 06:12.151
Jimmy Edwards. Sorry.

06:17.858 --> 06:20.241
How about we just try and let
go of all the pain on this trip

06:20.275 --> 06:23.211
and only focus on the
good things in our lives?

06:23.315 --> 06:24.802
Okay, who's with me?

06:24.907 --> 06:26.371
- Ready for that.
- Definitely.

06:26.477 --> 06:27.660
Okay, Luke?

06:30.546 --> 06:32.861
Lucas? Lucas?

06:32.967 --> 06:34.681
Yeah, sure.

06:42.476 --> 06:44.730
I don't know why
you do it, Conrad.

06:44.836 --> 06:46.353
We keep playing.

06:47.555 --> 06:48.942
You keep losing.

06:51.696 --> 06:53.650
Um, hiya, fellas.

06:53.925 --> 06:54.940
I'm Mouth.

06:55.046 --> 06:56.091
Mouth, huh?

06:56.196 --> 06:58.861
I mean, uh, Marvin. Marvin.

07:00.018 --> 07:02.253
Listen, guys, I don't want any trouble.
I mean,

07:02.355 --> 07:05.241
I like girls, really. See?

07:08.866 --> 07:10.903
Um, if I could just
get that back --

07:11.275 --> 07:12.583
Or what?

07:13.256 --> 07:15.833
Listen, I know you could
probably kill me right now --

07:16.068 --> 07:18.981
I mean...
definitely kill me right now,

07:19.086 --> 07:22.631
but you're only three moves away
from winning your chess match.

07:23.105 --> 07:27.202
Knight to G7. I'm sure you were
just about to do that anyway...

07:27.886 --> 07:29.150
Sir.

07:33.198 --> 07:34.332
Guard.

07:48.715 --> 07:49.940
Checkmate.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.182
No one touches the kid.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.626
Skills. Hey.

08:12.006 --> 08:13.583
Come on, man,
it's your turn to drive.

08:13.689 --> 08:15.461
We're each taking
four-hour shifts.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.623
Hey, Brooke.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.430
Yo, B. Davis.

08:47.646 --> 08:49.553
It's your turn to drive, baby.

08:52.296 --> 08:53.673
Already?

08:54.096 --> 08:55.510
Four hours.

08:57.085 --> 09:00.332
So, let me get this straight.
You slept with Shelly.

09:00.905 --> 09:02.943
The Clean Teen with
the leather pants?

09:03.047 --> 09:04.120
Yep.

09:04.356 --> 09:05.831
My man!

09:07.128 --> 09:09.593
But then you took
Brooke to the prom --

09:09.695 --> 09:11.443
Brooke Davis.

09:12.596 --> 09:15.171
Is Brooke the one with
the clothing line?

09:18.096 --> 09:20.121
But then you left
town with Rachel

09:20.225 --> 09:22.821
and all of her fine
plastic parts.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.492
So, what happened, Mouth?

09:28.636 --> 09:30.731
You guys ever had
your heart broken?

09:37.347 --> 09:38.762
What's going on up there?

09:38.867 --> 09:39.931
I don't know.

09:40.036 --> 09:42.092
How long has that light
on the dash been on?

09:42.198 --> 09:46.502
Um, just a little while. It was kind
of a pretty color, and I liked it.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.080
Bad call?

10:01.327 --> 10:02.581
Bad call.

10:06.466 --> 10:07.570
I don't know.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.323
It's all electronic.
I can't figure it out.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.013
But I do know we should have
stuck to the interstate

10:14.116 --> 10:17.532
and not taken the back roads just so Haley
could see the sandwich shaped like Elvis.

10:17.635 --> 10:19.193
- Hey!
- Hold on a second.

10:19.297 --> 10:23.351
I, too, wanted to see the sandwich shaped
like Elvis. I'm pretty sure we all did.

10:23.465 --> 10:24.390
Thank you.

10:24.496 --> 10:26.412
And, Lucas, admit it.

10:26.517 --> 10:29.442
You wanted to see the Elvis sandwich,
too, didn't you?

10:30.098 --> 10:32.753
Fine. I wanted to see
the Elvis sandwich, okay?

10:32.856 --> 10:35.490
But that still doesn't change the fact
that we haven't seen a car pass by

10:35.525 --> 10:36.452
since we stopped.

10:37.556 --> 10:39.102
Until now.

10:41.268 --> 10:42.483
It's a bus.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.130
That's a tour bus.

10:44.237 --> 10:45.572
Please be the Foo Fighters.

10:45.677 --> 10:47.282
Please be Kanye.

10:54.376 --> 10:56.612
Well, well.

10:56.717 --> 11:00.121
Stupid Elvis sandwich.

11:10.195 --> 11:12.892
Let's see here.
Slept with you...

11:12.998 --> 11:16.000
kissed you...
got slapped by you.

11:16.725 --> 11:19.183
Just like any other night
on Chris Keller's tour bus.

11:19.286 --> 11:22.483
So, they can tow the car to Honey Grove,
but we're on our own.

11:22.587 --> 11:24.201
We're rolling right
through there.

11:24.307 --> 11:26.163
You guys should
just crash with me.

11:26.265 --> 11:28.072
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

11:28.176 --> 11:31.742
You know, without Nate trying to kill
me for singing duets with Haley.

11:32.257 --> 11:35.302
I'm down for all that.
Yo, you got some gin in this joint?

11:35.405 --> 11:36.862
Full bar in back.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.861
I'm loving Chris Keller.

11:40.126 --> 11:41.691
Look, I got plenty of room.

11:41.797 --> 11:44.442
I'm going your way.
Haley can sleep in my bed.

11:45.475 --> 11:47.922
Though you're looking
a little plump, Hales.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.283
What the hell?
I've had bigger trunk in my bunk.

11:52.777 --> 11:55.113
I'm pregnant, you idiot.

11:58.608 --> 12:00.301
Dude, totally not mine.

12:29.268 --> 12:30.842
Well, everything
seems to be okay.

12:30.947 --> 12:32.041
Are you missing anything?

12:32.248 --> 12:34.581
I-I don't think so.

12:35.386 --> 12:36.573
I'm sorry.

12:36.818 --> 12:40.150
It's just that Lucas wasn't here,
and the door was open, and I just...

12:41.818 --> 12:43.703
I'm so embarrassed
that I called you.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.602
No, no. Don't be. I would've been
upset if you didn't call me.

12:46.777 --> 12:48.202
Now I'm gonna make
you some tea.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.462
I want you to relax
and take it easy.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.643
That stress isn't
healthy for the baby.

13:02.058 --> 13:04.182
So, what's up? You been good?

13:04.288 --> 13:07.783
Yeah, I'm all right.
Just dealing with some stuff.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.571
Like what?

13:09.687 --> 13:11.021
Nothing, really.

13:11.206 --> 13:12.451
I can handle it.

13:13.355 --> 13:15.372
Same old Nathan Scott.

13:16.718 --> 13:17.773
What about you?

13:17.878 --> 13:19.141
What's your story?

13:20.625 --> 13:24.060
Oh, you know,
just driving blue highways,

13:24.166 --> 13:26.511
looking for that life
you already got.

13:26.645 --> 13:29.972
You know, for the luckiest guy I know,
you worry too much.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.700
And contrary to popular belief,

13:33.808 --> 13:36.612
most of life's problems don't
get solved on a tour bus

13:36.715 --> 13:38.291
in the middle of Texas.

13:38.977 --> 13:41.052
Turn your mind off and relax.

14:54.495 --> 14:56.870
Well, this is it --
Honey Grove,

14:56.977 --> 14:58.790
the sweetest town in Texas.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.153
Get it?
'Cause of the honey part?

15:01.645 --> 15:03.333
Now we just got to find Mouth.

15:03.437 --> 15:05.792
I guess I'd just ask a
cop if I were you guys.

15:05.897 --> 15:08.400
Right, let's just walk up to
the first cop we see and say,

15:08.506 --> 15:10.292
"hey, have you seen
our friend Mouth?"

15:10.407 --> 15:12.423
Why not? It's a small town.

15:12.548 --> 15:14.452
- Excuse me!
- Keller.

15:16.807 --> 15:18.711
Top of the morning,
officer friendly.

15:18.815 --> 15:20.902
Shut up. Excuse me, sir.
We're looking for a friend of ours.

15:20.938 --> 15:23.091
Kind of goofy-looking kid,
big lips, spiky hair?

15:23.195 --> 15:24.491
Needs ass.

15:25.755 --> 15:27.201
Marvin McFadden.

15:27.308 --> 15:29.401
Damn. Our guy's name is Mouth.

15:30.427 --> 15:31.851
Marvin McFadden?

15:35.285 --> 15:37.822
Luke! Guys!
Man, am I glad to see you.

15:37.926 --> 15:39.032
Mouth, what happened?

15:39.137 --> 15:41.962
It's kind of a long story.
Let's just get out of here.

15:42.396 --> 15:43.583
Conrad.

15:46.047 --> 15:47.261
Gino!

15:58.525 --> 15:59.980
Let him go, Lemmy.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.093
Dan?

16:24.466 --> 16:26.600
Oh, hi.

16:27.268 --> 16:29.323
- You spent the night?
- Yeah.

16:30.097 --> 16:32.212
Yeah. Just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

16:35.005 --> 16:37.811
I'm sorry. I must look like hell.
I should go.

16:38.926 --> 16:41.222
Or I could make us
some breakfast.

16:45.007 --> 16:46.161
I'd like that.

16:50.748 --> 16:51.973
I understand.

16:52.106 --> 16:53.880
You have to do what
you have to do.

16:57.656 --> 16:58.722
Everything okay?

16:58.828 --> 17:00.853
Yeah. Just checking on my mom.

17:00.955 --> 17:02.303
Hey, we found him.

17:02.407 --> 17:05.151
- Hey, Mouth!
- Now I'm really emrrassed.

17:05.257 --> 17:06.670
You guys didn't
all have to come.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.859
- We wanted to, man.
- Yeah, man, definitely.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.332
Who are you again?

17:10.528 --> 17:12.900
I'm the idiot who got arrested
for sleeping in the park.

17:13.006 --> 17:13.941
Wait. What?

17:14.048 --> 17:16.683
You didn't tell us what happened.
Where's Rachel?

17:16.787 --> 17:19.642
Uh, it's kind of a long story.
She's just, um...

17:19.746 --> 17:21.230
- She's gone.
- Damn it.

17:21.336 --> 17:23.801
Anyway, I tried texting you guys,
but my phone died.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.112
I just want to go home.

17:25.217 --> 17:28.079
Unfortunately the car won't
be ready till tomorrow.

17:28.188 --> 17:30.050
But there are rooms
available at a motel.

17:30.156 --> 17:31.652
- Sorry, guys.
- No, don't be sorry.

17:31.756 --> 17:33.802
We wanted to come.
We're just glad you're okay.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.363
Besides, I'm sure we can find
something fun to do in this town.

17:36.396 --> 17:38.671
Yeah, right. What?
Look at this place.

17:40.656 --> 17:42.343
We'll go to prom.

17:42.445 --> 17:43.362
Prom?

17:43.466 --> 17:46.331
Yeah, Honey Grove's prom is tonight.
We should go.

17:46.437 --> 17:48.472
Come on, our prom sucked.
Our car broke down.

17:48.578 --> 17:50.352
Yeah, and we got
attacked by a psycho.

17:50.456 --> 17:51.693
- What?
- Long story.

17:51.797 --> 17:53.850
We're just gonna crash
the Honey Grove prom?

17:53.958 --> 17:55.321
Yeah, why not?

17:55.947 --> 18:00.200
Okay, hold on. Where are we gonna
get tuxes and dresses by tonight?

18:00.627 --> 18:02.101
We go old-school.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.322
Check it out.

18:05.047 --> 18:06.640
I see what I'm wearing tonight.

18:06.947 --> 18:09.522
Dude, not if I beat you to it.
Come on!

18:14.196 --> 18:16.151
It's good to see you and
Peyton getting along.

18:16.257 --> 18:17.421
Yeah.

18:17.778 --> 18:21.321
You know, we've been staying together
at Luke's every night since the attack.

18:21.885 --> 18:25.171
It works out 'cause I'm basically
homeless, now that Rachel's gone, anyway.

18:25.277 --> 18:28.643
Right. Speaking of that,
I wanted to know

18:28.746 --> 18:31.693
if maybe you wanted to
take the apartment back.

18:32.658 --> 18:34.603
Nathan and I are gonna
go stay with his mom,

18:34.705 --> 18:36.152
at least until the end
of the school year.

18:36.185 --> 18:38.442
And you still have all
your old stuff in there.

18:38.757 --> 18:41.850
- What do you think?
- Yes. I mean, definitely.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.072
- Thank you. That's great.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

18:44.175 --> 18:46.742
I mean, also, besides,
the sooner you cut your ties

18:46.847 --> 18:48.833
with that lying thief Rachel,
the better, right?

18:48.935 --> 18:49.883
Yeah.

19:00.525 --> 19:02.423
Can't believe I'm going stag.

19:02.525 --> 19:05.720
Dude, so what happened to you,
anyway, with Rachel?

19:06.088 --> 19:07.631
I just wanted Shelly back.

19:07.738 --> 19:08.663
Shelly?

19:08.767 --> 19:10.942
She was the girl I'd
just started dating.

19:11.386 --> 19:14.181
Actually, we, uh,
never really got started.

19:14.285 --> 19:15.521
She blew you off, huh?

19:15.626 --> 19:17.282
I just felt so...

19:17.428 --> 19:19.300
not good enough, you know?

19:19.735 --> 19:23.533
Like I wasn't good enough to make her
stay. I wasn't enough to amaze her.

19:24.217 --> 19:26.022
I just wanted to amaze her.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.402
Bitches.

19:28.058 --> 19:29.583
And then Rachel...

19:30.536 --> 19:32.451
She made me feel special.

19:33.266 --> 19:34.870
And there's such
a power in that,

19:34.977 --> 19:37.020
especially with a girl
who looks like Rachel.

19:38.055 --> 19:40.770
And even though I kind
of knew we were a lie,

19:41.036 --> 19:43.553
it was like a pain reliever.

19:43.905 --> 19:46.000
I mean,
the pain was still there, but...

19:46.107 --> 19:47.510
I didn't feel it for a while.

19:47.618 --> 19:48.782
So what happened?

19:48.887 --> 19:52.750
Well, we flew to New Orleans and we
rented a car and we just started driving.

19:52.856 --> 19:54.893
And Rachel was telling me
how I was good enough,

19:54.996 --> 19:56.642
how I was dangerous.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.891
And then one night,
as this amazing sun was setting,

20:02.036 --> 20:03.513
she called me worthy.

20:03.616 --> 20:06.092
Okay. Oh, fine.
Fine, Mouth, but tell me --

20:06.197 --> 20:07.651
what about the sex?

20:09.457 --> 20:11.852
So we get to this hotel,
and we're in the bar.

20:12.256 --> 20:14.412
She kind of starts
flirting with this guy.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.943
And then she said something.

20:16.046 --> 20:17.260
What did she say?

20:18.808 --> 20:20.690
She told him he was worthy.

20:22.527 --> 20:24.652
Hearing her say it
to someone else,

20:24.758 --> 20:27.963
I knew that there would always
be a someone else with her,

20:28.678 --> 20:30.371
'cause that's who she is.

20:31.766 --> 20:35.190
Anyway, I went for a walk,
and I ended up on the town square --

20:35.298 --> 20:36.921
you know,
where you guys were today?

20:37.747 --> 20:40.792
I started thinking about how
much I was throwing away,

20:41.037 --> 20:43.590
how tanking my finals
would crush my parents

20:43.697 --> 20:46.972
and how I'm not that guy.

20:50.217 --> 20:51.903
I'm not dangerous.

20:55.306 --> 20:58.033
I'm Marvin McFadden. I'm solid.

20:58.375 --> 20:59.892
I'm dependable.

21:03.787 --> 21:04.720
That's who I am.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.711
Tell me you at least
slept with her.

21:07.198 --> 21:08.992
You suck, man.

21:09.117 --> 21:10.220
Where is she?

21:10.326 --> 21:12.922
I don't know. I called her
and told her I was going home,

21:13.025 --> 21:16.091
and when I got back to the room,
she was gone.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.273
This picture of us was
all she left behind.

21:22.725 --> 21:25.293
"I could've loved the
boy in this picture."

21:25.547 --> 21:27.612
I hate you, Mouth.
You know that?

21:27.716 --> 21:30.983
You sure you didn't sleep with
her before your lame-ass epiphany?

21:31.088 --> 21:32.211
No.

21:33.968 --> 21:35.883
But I did see her naked.

21:36.308 --> 21:38.360
You really suck, man.
You know that?

21:57.368 --> 22:00.572
Anybody ever tell you that you're
kind of pretty, Haley James Scott?

22:00.715 --> 22:02.473
Does Chris Keller count?

22:05.506 --> 22:08.103
You know what's great about being
a married couple going to a prom?

22:08.145 --> 22:08.781
What?

22:08.886 --> 22:11.171
You get to use the hotel
room before the dance.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.042
Penny for your thoughts?

22:27.366 --> 22:29.642
I'm not sure they're
worth that much.

22:30.006 --> 22:31.943
Just thinking about Chase.

22:32.327 --> 22:34.080
I'm really sorry, Brooke.

22:34.857 --> 22:36.102
You miss him?

22:37.138 --> 22:38.580
Yeah, I do.

22:39.005 --> 22:42.032
Plus, I'm not really a fan
of being alone these days.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.973
Oh, well, I was thinking maybe
you could move in with me.

22:46.977 --> 22:50.382
I can't.
I'm moving back into the apartment.

22:51.867 --> 22:53.222
Okay, cool.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.730
I just -- yeah.

22:54.838 --> 22:57.690
But maybe you
could move in, too?

22:58.447 --> 22:59.932
You mean that?

23:01.585 --> 23:02.802
Yeah.

23:04.668 --> 23:05.810
Look...

23:07.758 --> 23:10.792
I know I said we could never
be friends like before.

23:14.327 --> 23:15.410
But...

23:16.445 --> 23:18.182
maybe we can be better.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.820
You look beautiful.

23:42.757 --> 23:44.883
Hey, Skills,
you know this girl?

23:45.676 --> 23:46.722
Yeah.

23:47.066 --> 23:48.030
That's Abby.

23:48.137 --> 23:49.783
She was in the tutor center.

23:50.325 --> 23:51.493
You know.

23:54.198 --> 23:56.183
You know,
it just never made no sense to me.

23:56.285 --> 23:57.511
What's that?

23:58.526 --> 24:03.450
Jimmy. See, Abby had diabetes,
so he let her go.

24:05.835 --> 24:09.080
Look, I know Jimmy was all
distraught and not hisself, but...

24:09.327 --> 24:14.531
I could never understand how he could
just have it in his heart to let Abby go,

24:14.657 --> 24:18.421
but with Keith,
that was somebody he knew and loved.

24:22.637 --> 24:23.661
Luke.

24:30.505 --> 24:32.912
Lucas Scott,
will you go to prom with me?

24:33.016 --> 24:34.571
Absolutely.

24:53.898 --> 24:56.121
Nice outfits.

24:56.605 --> 24:58.032
You guys crashing?

24:58.268 --> 25:00.210
Who, us? No.

25:00.316 --> 25:02.050
Honey Grove's a small town.

25:02.505 --> 25:04.342
We know everybody
in our school.

25:05.178 --> 25:06.883
Okay, look. Here's the deal.

25:06.988 --> 25:09.323
We got stranded here,
and our prom really sucked,

25:09.425 --> 25:11.461
so we figured maybe we
could come to yours.

25:11.566 --> 25:13.083
You won't tell anyone,
will you?

25:13.188 --> 25:14.870
No, it's cool.

25:15.665 --> 25:16.850
You guys have fun.

25:20.155 --> 25:21.942
Anybody want to dance?

26:08.005 --> 26:10.292
So nobody has a
fatal heart condition

26:10.397 --> 26:13.452
and a father who was
purposely set on fire?

26:14.837 --> 26:17.131
You probably have classmates
who are married, right?

26:18.205 --> 26:21.201
Wife's pregnant?
Got married as juniors?

26:22.208 --> 26:25.373
I started the clothing line after
Peyton and I shoplifted my designs back

26:25.477 --> 26:26.571
and got arrested.

26:26.675 --> 26:28.901
Arrested? What did
your parents say?

26:29.005 --> 26:31.450
Oh, I haven't seen my
parents in like a year.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.450
I live with my friend Rachel.
She's so funny.

26:33.558 --> 26:36.422
She's had all this plastic surgery,
and she just got suspended, and...

26:36.836 --> 26:38.673
Now she's kind of missing.

26:39.805 --> 26:41.232
You ever had your heart broken?

26:41.335 --> 26:43.490
Yeah, I think that
happens everywhere.

26:54.577 --> 26:57.043
You know, I really appreciate
the way you've been lately

26:57.148 --> 26:58.831
since my pregnancy.

27:00.236 --> 27:01.303
But?

27:02.535 --> 27:06.100
Well, you can't blame
me for being cautious.

27:06.496 --> 27:09.630
17 years of misery
is a long time.

27:09.848 --> 27:11.183
Why now?

27:12.395 --> 27:14.202
I was lying to myself, Karen.

27:14.728 --> 27:16.282
I was also married.

27:16.466 --> 27:19.643
I'm single now,
for the first time since I was 17,

27:19.747 --> 27:21.080
and truly in love.

27:24.658 --> 27:26.483
You're still in
my heart, Karen.

27:28.228 --> 27:29.733
That's why now.

27:43.947 --> 27:45.040
What?

27:46.467 --> 27:48.623
We've just been
through so much.

27:48.725 --> 27:50.573
You've been through so much.

27:50.698 --> 27:53.503
Sometimes I wonder how
you put up with me.

27:55.998 --> 27:57.932
I gave you my heart.

27:58.097 --> 28:00.993
When you fall short --
when we fall short...

28:03.845 --> 28:05.830
...I know we're gonna be okay.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.511
You're my forever.
You're my always.

28:12.696 --> 28:15.092
God, the way you look
at me sometimes.

28:19.145 --> 28:21.783
Thanks for being so good
to me this week, Luke...

28:21.887 --> 28:23.060
and to Brooke.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.681
It means everything.

28:24.898 --> 28:26.752
I'd do anything for you.

28:30.386 --> 28:32.503
Uh, could you get a room?

28:35.577 --> 28:37.133
Do you want to?

28:50.568 --> 28:53.271
I'd avoid the punch.
It's more vodka than punch.

28:53.376 --> 28:55.532
Great. Thank you for the tip.

28:56.018 --> 28:57.913
- You having fun, tutor girl?
- Yeah, I am.

28:58.015 --> 29:01.541
Although I think you mean ex-tutor girl,
thanks to that hag Rachel.

29:03.266 --> 29:04.922
Haley, it was me.

29:05.867 --> 29:07.300
What was?

29:07.918 --> 29:09.710
I stole the test. I cheated.

29:09.818 --> 29:11.381
Rachel just took
the fall for me.

29:11.487 --> 29:12.823
Are you kidding me?

29:12.925 --> 29:15.803
Brooke, I got fired for that. Not to
mention the fact that I trusted you

29:15.856 --> 29:17.252
and you lied to my face.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.333
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just...

29:19.437 --> 29:22.273
I wasn't gonna graduate, and then she
told me I'd lose my clothing contract,

29:22.305 --> 29:23.940
- and I panicked and --
- Unbelievable.

29:24.046 --> 29:25.673
Haley, wait. Don't go.
I feel terrible.

29:25.775 --> 29:27.243
I'm sure you do.

29:28.845 --> 29:29.841
You know what?

29:29.948 --> 29:31.873
That tape with you and
Nathan really hurt me,

29:31.977 --> 29:35.031
but I decided to let it go because
that was a Brooke I didn't know.

29:36.598 --> 29:37.992
This is worse.

29:38.095 --> 29:39.613
My friend did this.

29:49.817 --> 29:51.350
You girls want to dance?

29:51.455 --> 29:52.780
No, thanks.

29:53.997 --> 29:56.603
Wait. You're Chris
Keller, right?

29:56.705 --> 29:57.980
That's right.

30:00.285 --> 30:02.032
How old are you?

30:11.075 --> 30:12.483
I had a great evening, Karen.

30:12.586 --> 30:14.570
Thanks. I can see myself out.

30:15.556 --> 30:17.611
Well, maybe we
could do this again.

30:18.485 --> 30:19.761
Soon.

30:21.178 --> 30:22.421
Sure.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.110
But just friends, right?

30:27.135 --> 30:28.510
We'll see.

30:49.857 --> 30:51.280
You've got protection, right?

30:51.386 --> 30:52.780
Have you met my father?

30:52.888 --> 30:54.443
Of course you do. Sorry.

30:55.625 --> 30:56.713
Luke.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.762
I'm really glad we waited.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.861
Last year would have been just sex,
and now I...

31:03.665 --> 31:05.823
I am so in love with you.

31:06.818 --> 31:08.700
I love you, too, Peyton.

31:17.885 --> 31:19.570
So, B. Davis,
you have fun tonight?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.101
Oh, I have a good time.

31:21.206 --> 31:22.671
You seem a little drunk.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.362
I said I have a good time.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.430
- After-hours in my room?
- Yeah.

31:29.868 --> 31:31.383
Damn, I got to stop doing this.

31:31.486 --> 31:34.243
Oh, god. I'm so sorry, really.

31:37.505 --> 31:39.200
That was uncomfortable.

31:39.448 --> 31:40.881
You know what, guys?

31:41.445 --> 31:42.973
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.801
You sure? You been drinking.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.152
Trust me, I'm sober now.

32:00.958 --> 32:02.320
How's my girl feeling?

32:03.736 --> 32:04.922
Okay.

32:05.765 --> 32:07.243
Is your leg bothering you?

32:07.348 --> 32:09.381
No, my leg is not bothering me.

32:09.485 --> 32:11.210
It's Brooke that's
bothering me.

32:11.318 --> 32:14.181
I'm trying to let it all go and
just be here with you, but...

32:15.127 --> 32:16.803
Anything I can help with?

32:18.127 --> 32:20.292
No. Not really.

32:26.805 --> 32:28.542
Tell me a secret.

32:29.358 --> 32:30.461
Risky.

32:31.307 --> 32:32.382
Okay.

32:34.726 --> 32:38.760
For the past few months, I've been
pretty freaked out about being a dad.

32:39.467 --> 32:43.251
But lately, I, uh,
I know it's gonna be okay.

32:43.538 --> 32:45.532
It's gonna be great, actually.

32:47.938 --> 32:51.253
You are so sexy when
you talk like that.

32:54.327 --> 32:56.523
I'm so glad we made this trip.

32:57.185 --> 32:59.272
I'm always gonna remember this.

32:59.535 --> 33:01.290
- Honey Grove?
- No.

33:02.208 --> 33:04.423
How much I love you right now.

33:19.187 --> 33:21.603
Well, well.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.583
Took you long enough.

33:23.685 --> 33:25.432
Don't flatter yourself.

33:25.705 --> 33:27.133
Want to come inside?

33:27.238 --> 33:29.831
I get really good-looking
after a few drinks.

33:29.936 --> 33:32.163
Oh, but I've already
had a few drinks.

33:32.267 --> 33:34.180
And how do I look?

33:34.285 --> 33:36.792
As good as the last
time I got you wasted?

33:37.066 --> 33:38.291
Listen.

33:39.168 --> 33:42.523
My last couple relationships
have been screwed up big-time.

33:42.627 --> 33:45.901
And I also have a terrible
fear of being alone.

33:46.747 --> 33:48.742
So if we slept together,

33:48.848 --> 33:51.700
it would just mean that I'm drunk
and trying to kill the pain.

33:51.807 --> 33:55.551
It wouldn't have
anything to do with you.

33:58.487 --> 34:00.023
Works for me.

34:00.656 --> 34:01.731
No.

34:05.596 --> 34:06.811
No.

34:08.775 --> 34:10.922
I got to stop all that.

34:12.045 --> 34:14.161
I'm graduating soon.

34:14.578 --> 34:17.353
And god forbid
I end up like you.

34:20.277 --> 34:22.083
So you just want to talk?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.802
You just want to talk?

34:25.757 --> 34:27.010
Sure.

34:27.395 --> 34:30.150
Chris Keller gets lonely,
too, sometimes.

34:32.466 --> 34:34.101
I heard that.

34:39.594 --> 34:40.972
Tell me something.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.783
I can't believe you guys
came all this way to get me.

34:48.885 --> 34:50.433
You're our boy, dog.

34:51.875 --> 34:54.850
You know how I've been complaining
about being everyone's friend?

34:55.108 --> 34:56.310
No more.

34:56.547 --> 34:58.112
I'm lucky to be that guy.

34:58.215 --> 35:01.890
And I have a lot of great things because of
it and a lot of great friends because of it.

35:01.995 --> 35:03.332
See, there you go.

35:03.547 --> 35:06.181
I call this a good road trip.

35:06.286 --> 35:07.413
Yeah.

35:08.796 --> 35:10.703
So, graduation soon, huh?

35:10.808 --> 35:12.720
It's a little intimidating.
I mean,

35:12.825 --> 35:16.643
I only spent a few days in the real world,
and I got to say, it was kind of scary.

35:16.745 --> 35:18.282
You'll be a'ight, dog.

35:18.385 --> 35:19.841
I mean, we all gonna be.

35:19.946 --> 35:21.442
And if you ain't,

35:21.586 --> 35:23.872
your good friends gonna
get you through it, right?

35:24.216 --> 35:25.160
Yeah.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.012
My dog.

35:42.336 --> 35:43.521
Hey, you.

35:44.967 --> 35:46.163
You okay?

35:47.175 --> 35:48.973
Wow. You look beautiful.

35:52.286 --> 35:53.421
You seem sad.

35:54.957 --> 35:56.802
No. I'm not.

35:58.237 --> 35:59.481
It's just...

36:03.186 --> 36:05.392
...I really love you, Lucas.

36:05.725 --> 36:07.402
And it's a big deal.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.021
I love you, too, Peyton.

36:16.405 --> 36:17.653
I promise.

36:20.146 --> 36:22.111
I need to go see Brooke.

36:22.486 --> 36:25.010
It's our first night
apart since the attack.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.511
Hey.

36:33.028 --> 36:34.651
I'm sorry about last night.

36:35.548 --> 36:36.760
It's okay.

36:37.137 --> 36:38.972
Life's too short, you know?

36:40.727 --> 36:43.471
So, does the roommate
offer still stand?

36:44.006 --> 36:45.222
Yeah.

36:46.118 --> 36:48.661
If we're gonna live together,
we need to come up with a system,

36:48.765 --> 36:50.723
'cause I don't want
to see that again.

36:50.825 --> 36:51.982
Yeah.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.052
Did someone say threesome?

36:55.157 --> 36:57.623
'Cause I'm a little sore,
but I could be real up for that.

36:57.727 --> 36:58.620
Sore from what?

36:58.725 --> 37:01.791
Staying up all night,
talking about your feelings and crying?

37:02.025 --> 37:03.941
You said you
weren't gonna tell.

37:18.807 --> 37:20.503
Haley, can I talk to you?

37:28.026 --> 37:29.981
I'm gonna tell
Turner the truth.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.702
Don't.

37:34.868 --> 37:36.893
So I lost my job at
the tutoring center.

37:36.998 --> 37:40.373
It's not as important as you not
graduating or losing your clothing contract.

37:40.475 --> 37:44.752
Thank you, but none of that
is as important to me as us.

37:45.458 --> 37:48.073
I mean,
maybe my clothing contract but...

37:48.177 --> 37:51.070
No, seriously, none of it.

37:51.175 --> 37:54.193
I'm just so sorry that I
didn't tell you, Haley.

37:54.688 --> 37:56.533
Can you forgive me?

37:58.517 --> 38:00.723
You are on notice,
Brooke Davis.

38:00.827 --> 38:02.401
Clean up your act

38:02.506 --> 38:04.182
and be the girl I love.

38:09.015 --> 38:13.153
Well, Chris Keller's
work here is done.

38:19.678 --> 38:20.832
Okay.

38:21.638 --> 38:22.910
I'm leaving.

38:25.295 --> 38:26.491
Okay.

38:36.718 --> 38:38.583
I think I'm gonna
miss Honey Grove.

38:52.058 --> 38:53.493
Yeah. Me too.

38:58.707 --> 39:00.721
So, what do you want to hear,
P. Sawyer?

39:01.187 --> 39:02.990
I'm feeling the road mix.

40:19.686 --> 40:20.492
Hey.

40:20.595 --> 40:21.810
I need to talk to you.

40:21.918 --> 40:23.070
Yeah. What's up?

40:24.606 --> 40:27.102
I've been getting calls from
this federal investigator.

40:27.205 --> 40:29.801
He's asking questions
about point-shaving, Luke.

40:30.217 --> 40:32.391
Yeah, but we won the
state championship.

40:32.556 --> 40:35.263
Not state. Semifinals.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.323
What are you gonna do?

40:40.588 --> 40:42.520
They're not asking
about me, Luke.

40:43.018 --> 40:44.733
They're asking about you.

40:52.426 --> 40:54.483
Mr. Mayor,
the phone was prepaid.

40:54.586 --> 40:55.932
The only calls
were made to you.

40:56.038 --> 40:58.553
After the school shooting,
we fingerprinted all the students.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.063
I found a match.

41:04.877 --> 41:06.703
William blake once wrote,

41:06.808 --> 41:08.400
"There are thing that are known

41:08.506 --> 41:10.463
"and things that are unknown.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.392
"And in between...

41:13.015 --> 41:14.572
"there are doors."
