DR. ECKLAND: Professor
Thomas H. Crawford,
molecular biologist.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.401
During the
Second World War,

06:02.530 --> 06:06.148
he was one of a small number
ofAmerican scientists

06:06.242 --> 06:10.076
who belonged to something
called the War Bureau
of Consultants.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.071
The group was charged
with investigating

06:13.207 --> 06:16.244
the feasibility of
a US bio-weapons program.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.579
Looks like
Crawford was murdered
in his office

06:18.671 --> 06:22.414

on the evening of
September 1st, 1944.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.004

a man and a woman,
were never found.

to do with the Twelve
Monkeys or the plague?

For what purpose?

I don't know.
DR. ECKLAND: Test for DNA.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.352

track Crawford to a
specific time and place.

also there in 1987.

trip didn't work out
like anyone hoped.

and killed Crawford.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.172

and find out what
they were up to.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.590
Could be his research.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.259
It might be their
Plan B for the virus.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.426
He might know something.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.846

decades before

07:12.933 --> 07:15.265

of RNA propagation.

His work would've
been useless
to the Monkeys.

ahead of his time,

07:19.857 --> 07:21.939
and they killed him
before he got a chance
to prove it.

you to accompany him.

the Messengers,
seen their faces.

before they strike.

the plague starts in 2016.

very well have been

to guide him

08:16.914 --> 08:18.370
If Mr. Cole fails

08:19.833 --> 08:21.243
we all fail.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.483
Our reports show
that Professor Crawford
was murdered in his office

08:47.569 --> 08:50.436
while a military ceremony
was taking place on campus.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.273

War was handing out
medals to war heroes.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.903
Well, if the Messengers
found a way in,

08:54.993 --> 08:56.449
so can we.
We've done it before.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.118
This will require a plan.

No, not on the ground,

We need a plan now.
Are we sneaking in,
going undercover?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.374
Bribe... We need money.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.627
Money won't be a problem.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.050
Here, they're worthless.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.972
But in 1944,
their street value
will be substantial.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.433
Trade it. Pawn it.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.177
Wear it if you'd like.

09:25.566 --> 09:29.184

splintered one person,
let alone two, this far back.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.267
KATARINA: No.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.193

of temporal anomalies,

09:32.281 --> 09:34.567
this science has
become even more inexact.

I've been drinking
whiskey sours.
You ever had one of those?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.559
Oh, my God.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.852
You like it here.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.812
(CHUCKLES)
What's not to like?

13:44.157 --> 13:48.651
We need a plan to get
into a secure military
function during wartime.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.451
And I got us on
the guest list

13:50.539 --> 13:53.997
with a generous donation
to the Columbia
alumni society.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.660
I'm on top of it.
Just relax.
Try to have some fun.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.416
This isn't a vacation.
(SCOFFS)

14:00.716 --> 14:02.252
Mr. Cole?
Yes?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.673
Telephone.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.379
For me?

14:05.470 --> 14:06.721
He asked for James Cole.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.136
Hello.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.849
Hello?
(LINE DROPS)

14:17.232 --> 14:18.392
Nothing.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.269
My apologies, sir.
There was a man
on the line.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.475
It sounded urgent.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.980
All right. Thanks, Stanley.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.410
What are you doing?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.408
This picture's going
to be taken tonight.
(SIGHS)

14:34.499 --> 14:36.535
Could risk causing a paradox
if there are two of them.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.667
We should burn those.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.292
Where you going?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.919
To get ready. (SIGHS)

14:45.010 --> 14:46.875
We have work to finish.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.845

15:27.135 --> 15:28.750

15:30.931 --> 15:32.216
WOMAN: (GASPS) James.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.298
I'm so delighted
you made it.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.226
lam so delighted you
could squeeze us in.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.477
This is
Cassandra Cole, my...
Sister.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.317
Janice Thompson,
with the alumni society.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.236
We are so grateful
for your brother's
generous donation.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.073
That's a lovely necklace.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.735
Thank you,
don't you just love it?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.029
A gift from
your brother.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:57.124 --> 15:58.489
He's such a catch.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.918
We had to
get on the list.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.041
(CAMERA FLASHES)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.457
Hey, folks, how 'bout
a big smile, huh?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.417
Could get you in
Stars and Stripes.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.466
(CHUCKLES)

16:14.558 --> 16:16.549
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
you can do better than that.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.678
Perfect. Thank you.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.059
Guess that's
out of the way.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.695
Where are you going?

16:31.783 --> 16:32.943
Drink.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.774
Keep your eyes open.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.242
BARTENDER:
Here you are, sir.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.617
I don't think Director
Hoover would approve

16:43.712 --> 16:45.623
of you drinking
while we're
on a detail.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.669
Take a look around.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.008
More Gls here
than the whole
European Theater.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.083
Jerry's not dumb enough
to crash this party.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.964
No reason not
to keep our wits.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.421
One of these eggheads
mightjust help
us win the war.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.967
(SIGHS) I gotta
hit thejohn.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.310

17:12.782 --> 17:14.488
Huh?
The beard.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.775
This is New York City,
not the Appalachians.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.452
You walk two blocks,
you'll run into at least
three barbershops.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.701
I'm going someplace cold.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.292
Someplace cold?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.200
Like the North Pole?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.751

there, Shirley?

17:27.088 --> 17:28.214
Excuse me?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.872

busting your balls.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.298
You just getting back?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.126
From where?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.586
Over there.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.087
You got the look.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.471
A man who's seen things.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.178
Yeah, I've seen
a few things.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.014
So who were you with?
Army, Marines?

17:44.981 --> 17:46.096
The Seventh.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.141
Seventh Infantry?
No shit. North Africa?

17:57.452 --> 17:58.953
(INAUDIBLE)

18:06.336 --> 18:08.827
The ashes of
yesterday washed away.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.538
You are prepared.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.839
Your mission is clear.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.180
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about it.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.810
As former Gls,
we have an obligation
to share our stories here.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.106
Listen, asshole.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.308
I'm just trying
to have a drink.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.939
There you are, James.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.479
Is my brother
troubling you?

18:36.908 --> 18:38.364
Not at all.
Ijust wanted to hear

18:38.451 --> 18:40.612
about this Seventh
he was stationed with.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.990
What with him being
a war hero and all.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.873
My brother was in
the Philippines in '42.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.368
Bataan?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.961
He fought the Japanese
for three months straight

18:52.048 --> 18:55.586
before he was
taken prisoner and
forced to march 60 miles

18:55.802 --> 18:58.009
from Mariveles
to San Fernando.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.929
When he finally escaped,
he was shot twice,

19:01.016 --> 19:02.176
including

19:03.393 --> 19:04.724
down there.

19:08.356 --> 19:12.065
So you will forgive him
if he doesn't want
to share his stories.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.731
I'm sorry, kid...

19:16.698 --> 19:18.154
Goddamn Japs.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.574
No hard feelings?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.444
No hard feelings.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.700
Why did it have
to be down there?

19:29.794 --> 19:33.036
I found one of
the Messengers.
She's with Crawford.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.789

19:38.178 --> 19:39.213

20:22.806 --> 20:24.421

20:25.225 --> 20:26.385

No beginning. No end.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.813
No death.
No blood to wash away.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.312
Destruction. Decomposition.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.061
Chaos, order, growth.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.024
This is not death.
There is no death.

Maybe he didn't
want people knowing
