DR. ECKLAND: Professor
Thomas H. Crawford,
molecular biologist.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.401
During the
Second World War,

06:02.530 --> 06:06.148
he was one of a small number
ofAmerican scientists

06:06.242 --> 06:10.076
who belonged to something
called the War Bureau
of Consultants.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.071
The group was charged
with investigating

06:13.207 --> 06:16.244
the feasibility of
a US bio-weapons program.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.579
Looks like
Crawford was murdered
in his office

06:18.671 --> 06:22.414

on the evening of
September 1st, 1944.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.004

a man and a woman,
were never found.

to do with the Twelve
Monkeys or the plague?

For what purpose?

I don't know.
DR. ECKLAND: Test for DNA.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.352

track Crawford to a
specific time and place.

also there in 1987.

trip didn't work out
like anyone hoped.

and killed Crawford.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.172

and find out what
they were up to.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.590
Could be his research.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.259
It might be their
Plan B for the virus.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.426
He might know something.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.846

decades before

07:12.933 --> 07:15.265

of RNA propagation.

His work would've
been useless
to the Monkeys.

ahead of his time,

07:19.857 --> 07:21.939
and they killed him
before he got a chance
to prove it.

you to accompany him.

the Messengers,
seen their faces.

before they strike.

the plague starts in 2016.

very well have been
in 1944.

to guide him

08:16.914 --> 08:18.370
If Mr. Cole fails

08:19.833 --> 08:21.243
we all fail.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.483
Our reports show
that Professor Crawford
was murdered in his office

08:47.569 --> 08:50.436
while a military ceremony
was taking place on campus.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.273

War was handing out
medals to war heroes.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.903
Well, if the Messengers
found a way in,

08:54.993 --> 08:56.449
so can we.
We've done it before.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.118
This will require a plan.

No, not on the ground,

We need a plan now.
Are we sneaking in,
going undercover?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.374
Bribe... We need money.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.627
Money won't be a problem.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.050
Here, they're worthless.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.972
But in 1944,
their street value
will be substantial.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.433
Trade it. Pawn it.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.177
Wear it if you'd like.

09:25.566 --> 09:29.184

splintered one person,
let alone two, this far back.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.267
KATARINA: No.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.193

of temporal anomalies,

09:32.281 --> 09:34.567
this science has
become even more inexact.

I've been drinking
whiskey sours.
You ever had one of those?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.559
Oh, my God.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.852
You like it here.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.812
(CHUCKLES)
What's not to like?

13:44.157 --> 13:48.651
We need a plan to get
into a secure military
function during wartime.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.451
And I got us on
the guest list

13:50.539 --> 13:53.997
with a generous donation
to the Columbia
alumni society.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.660
I'm on top of it.
Just relax.
Try to have some fun.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.416
This isn't a vacation.
(SCOFFS)

14:00.716 --> 14:02.252
Mr. Cole?
Yes?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.673
Telephone.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.379
For me?

14:05.470 --> 14:06.721
He asked for James Cole.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.136
Hello.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.849
Hello?
(LINE DROPS)

14:17.232 --> 14:18.392
Nothing.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.269
My apologies, sir.
There was a man
on the line.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.475
It sounded urgent.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.980
All right. Thanks, Stanley.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.410
What are you doing?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.408
This picture's going
to be taken tonight.
(SIGHS)

14:34.499 --> 14:36.535
Could risk causing a paradox
if there are two of them.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.667
We should burn those.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.292
Where you going?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.919
To get ready. (SIGHS)

14:45.010 --> 14:46.875
We have work to finish.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.845

15:27.135 --> 15:28.750

15:30.931 --> 15:32.216
WOMAN: (GASPS) James.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.298
I'm so delighted
you made it.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.226
lam so delighted you
could squeeze us in.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.477
This is
Cassandra Cole, my...
Sister.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.317
Janice Thompson,
with the alumni society.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.236
We are so grateful
for your brother's
generous donation.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.073
That's a lovely necklace.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.735
Thank you,
don't you just love it?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.029
A gift from
your brother.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:57.124 --> 15:58.489
He's such a catch.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.918
We had to
get on the list.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.041
(CAMERA FLASHES)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.457
Hey, folks, how 'bout
a big smile, huh?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.417
Could get you in
Stars and Stripes.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.466
(CHUCKLES)

16:14.558 --> 16:16.549
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
you can do better than that.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.678
Perfect. Thank you.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.059
Guess that's
out of the way.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.695
Where are you going?

16:31.783 --> 16:32.943
Drink.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.774
Keep your eyes open.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.242
BARTENDER:
Here you are, sir.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.617
I don't think Director
Hoover would approve

16:43.712 --> 16:45.623
of you drinking
while we're
on a detail.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.669
Take a look around.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.008
More Gls here
than the whole
European Theater.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.083
Jerry's not dumb enough
to crash this party.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.964
No reason not
to keep our wits.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.421
One of these eggheads
mightjust help
us win the war.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.967
(SIGHS) I gotta
hit thejohn.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.310

17:12.782 --> 17:14.488
Huh?
The beard.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.775
This is New York City,
not the Appalachians.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.452
You walk two blocks,
you'll run into at least
three barbershops.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.701
I'm going someplace cold.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.292
Someplace cold?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.200
Like the North Pole?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.751

there, Shirley?

17:27.088 --> 17:28.214
Excuse me?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.872

busting your balls.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.298
You just getting back?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.126
From where?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.586
Over there.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.087
You got the look.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.471
A man who's seen things.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.178
Yeah, I've seen
a few things.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.014
So who were you with?
Army, Marines?

17:44.981 --> 17:46.096
The Seventh.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.141
Seventh Infantry?
No shit. North Africa?

17:57.452 --> 17:58.953
(INAUDIBLE)

18:06.336 --> 18:08.827
The ashes of
yesterday washed away.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.538
You are prepared.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.839
Your mission is clear.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.180
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about it.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.810
As former Gls,
we have an obligation
to share our stories here.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.106
Listen, asshole.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.308
I'm just trying
to have a drink.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.939
There you are, James.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.479
Is my brother
troubling you?

18:36.908 --> 18:38.364
Not at all.
Ijust wanted to hear

18:38.451 --> 18:40.612
about this Seventh
he was stationed with.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.990
What with him being
a war hero and all.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.873
My brother was in
the Philippines in '42.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.368
Bataan?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.961
He fought the Japanese
for three months straight

18:52.048 --> 18:55.586
before he was
taken prisoner and
forced to march 60 miles

18:55.802 --> 18:58.009
from Mariveles
to San Fernando.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.929
When he finally escaped,
he was shot twice,

19:01.016 --> 19:02.176
including

19:03.393 --> 19:04.724
down there.

19:08.356 --> 19:12.065
So you will forgive him
if he doesn't want
to share his stories.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.731
I'm sorry, kid...

19:16.698 --> 19:18.154
Goddamn Japs.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.574
No hard feelings?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.444
No hard feelings.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.700
Why did it have
to be down there?

19:29.794 --> 19:33.036
I found one of
the Messengers.
She's with Crawford.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.789

19:38.178 --> 19:39.213

20:22.806 --> 20:24.421

20:25.225 --> 20:26.385

No beginning. No end.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.813
No death.
No blood to wash away.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.312
Destruction. Decomposition.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.061
Chaos, order, growth.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.024
This is not death.
There is no death.

Maybe he didn't
want people knowing
