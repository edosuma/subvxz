00:02.530 --> 00:05.190
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:05.300 --> 00:06.990
(BABY CRYING)

00:07.100 --> 00:08.900
Wait. Where are you going? I want to see.

00:09.000 --> 00:09.970
She is Orici.

00:10.070 --> 00:15.060
With the wisdom of the ages
she will lead us to glorious victory.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.770
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention,

00:17.880 --> 00:21.180
a weapon capable of
destroying Ascended beings.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.450
<i>MEURIK: Arthur and his knights left</i>
<i>to quest for the Sangraal long ago.</i>

00:25.550 --> 00:28.890
It is said that they journeyed
to three distant lands

00:28.990 --> 00:30.650
mentioned in Merlin's prophecy,

00:30.760 --> 00:34.290
Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.330
(GATE ACTIVATION ALARM BLARES)

00:46.270 --> 00:49.330
Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.930
Two were Jaffa strongholds.

00:52.050 --> 00:55.680
They attempted to resist, but were
overwhelmed within a matter of hours.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.320
According to those
who witnessed the battle,

01:00.420 --> 01:04.520
the enemy is led by a young woman
of extraordinary powers.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.970
Six planets in eight days and they don't
even have their full team in the field yet.

01:17.070 --> 01:18.630
Why haven't they
made a move against Earth?

01:18.740 --> 01:21.900
In all probability, the Ancient device
in Antarctica is giving them pause.

01:22.010 --> 01:23.910
At least until the rest
of their battle fleet gets here.

01:24.010 --> 01:27.000
I got it! I got it.

01:27.110 --> 01:28.510
I made the connection.

01:28.620 --> 01:33.640
Sir Gawain to Gwalchmei,
Culhwch, and Olwen. Verus Gen Bree.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.220
And you say I'm hard to understand.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.350
(STAMMERS) Oh, it's Vagonbrei,

01:38.460 --> 01:42.360
one of the planets Arthur and his knights
went to in their quest for the Holy Grail.

01:42.460 --> 01:44.330
I got the gate address.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.830
While on PX1767,
we got the names of three planets,

02:56.940 --> 02:59.670
Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei,

02:59.770 --> 03:01.900
three possible destinations
for Arthur and his knights

03:02.010 --> 03:05.950
in their quest for the Holy Grail,
what we know to be Merlin's weapon.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.480
Unfortunately, what we didn't get
were any corresponding gate addresses

03:08.580 --> 03:11.680
and the process of going through that
library page by page looking for clues

03:11.790 --> 03:12.770
could have potentially taken years.

03:12.890 --> 03:15.860
So I knew we were going to have to
narrow the search parameters a little.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.450
That's when it hit me. Sir Gawain.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.420
Wasn't he one of the knights
who says, <i>"Ni"?</i>

03:21.530 --> 03:24.160
He was a knight of the Round Table,
and in one his earliest incarnations,

03:24.260 --> 03:28.170
an old Welsh tale, he went on a quest
to help rescue a lost love.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.030
The legend says that Sir Gawain,
a.k.a. Gwalchmei,

03:31.140 --> 03:32.800
visited several lands
over the course of his adventure,

03:32.910 --> 03:35.900
including a place called
Gwlad Gan Brenhinol Gwir,

03:36.010 --> 03:38.270
which is Welsh for
"The land of royal truth."

03:38.380 --> 03:43.410
Translate that into Ancient and
you get "Verus Gen Bree." Vagonbrei.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.310
So how does that get us a gate address?

03:45.420 --> 03:47.280
It doesn't,
but it did give me something very specific

03:47.390 --> 03:49.820
to look for in Merlin's library,
namely, references to Gawain.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.250
Now, based on this information,

03:51.360 --> 03:53.760
I started scanning through the titles
and I found this.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.350
Now, the entire volume is dedicated
to Gawain's adventures

03:56.460 --> 03:58.260
and includes several
very interesting illustrations,

03:58.370 --> 04:00.530
including a depiction of a sword
he once carried.

04:00.630 --> 04:03.070
Note the symbols engraved on the blade.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.160
- A gate address.
- Vagonbrei.

04:05.270 --> 04:06.300
Well, we won't know till we check it out.

04:06.410 --> 04:09.810
Well done, Doctor. Colonel Carter,
what's the status of the Ori supergate?

04:09.910 --> 04:13.070
Any attempts we've made to dial out
to the Ori galaxy have failed.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.010
It looks like they're blocking us
from their end.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.740
There is a mothership in the area that will
alert us to the arrival of any other ships.

04:18.850 --> 04:22.190
More ships? We can hardly deal
with the ones that are already here.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.190
You have a go. Find that weapon.

04:24.290 --> 04:25.990
- Yes, sir.
- Will do.

04:26.090 --> 04:29.260
I was talking to SG-1.
You're not going anywhere.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.030
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

04:44.180 --> 04:45.870
General, I'm hoping
you might reconsider your decision

04:45.980 --> 04:48.110
and allow Vala to come with us.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.120
Given everything she's put you through,

04:51.220 --> 04:54.780
you're the last person
I would have expected to ask me that.

04:54.890 --> 04:59.190
Yes, sir, and I'm hoping that impresses
on you just how strongly I feel about this.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.990
Look, I know she's no angel.

05:03.100 --> 05:06.960
She's lied, she's stolen, she's cheated,
she's misrepresented herself.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.730
She's lied.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.170
But she also risked her life to warn us
that the Ori were on their way

05:13.270 --> 05:16.710
and almost sacrificed herself
to shut down the very first Ori supergate.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.280
I understand the contribution she's made.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.820
The truth is, the Pentagon
isn't willing to roll the dice on her.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.380
But you could convince them otherwise.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.150
You see, 10 years ago,
General Hammond sat in that very chair

05:31.260 --> 05:34.160
and he was faced with a similar decision.

05:34.260 --> 05:38.990
As former First Prime to Apophis, Teal'c
had committed some terrible crimes.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.190
As the former First Prime to Apophis,

05:41.300 --> 05:45.240
Teal'c provided valuable insight
to the enemy's resources and tactics.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.540
And as the mother
to the leader of the Ori army,

05:48.640 --> 05:51.130
Vala may hold the key to stopping them.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.680
If I push this issue

05:52.780 --> 05:55.840
and the Pentagon agrees
to let her join you on off-world missions,

05:55.950 --> 05:59.320
then I'd be the one ultimately
held accountable for her actions.

05:59.420 --> 06:03.080
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

06:05.230 --> 06:09.820
So I'd be counting on you
to keep her in line.

06:13.130 --> 06:14.600
Yes, sir.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.450
So can I go on the mission?

06:29.550 --> 06:31.710
No. You're not cleared
for off-world travel yet.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.810
You still have to go through
a psych evaluation.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.910
What's that?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.550
It's sort of an interview given to
all prospective SGC personnel,

06:37.660 --> 06:40.130
designed to assess
a person's psychological state,

06:40.260 --> 06:42.630
get a sense of their mental well-being.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.160
Oh, to find out if I'm...

06:44.260 --> 06:45.990
(MAKES STRANGE SOUND)

06:46.100 --> 06:47.070
...wonko.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.160
Right. So, they're going to
sit you down in a little room,

06:49.270 --> 06:51.860
get you talking about yourself,
and ask you a few questions.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.000
- So it's a test?
- Sort of.

06:54.110 --> 06:57.470
And all I have to do is pass.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.100
How hard can that be?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.370
I'm gonna have to do some research,
so I'm gonna use your computer

07:01.480 --> 07:02.470
while you're away on this mission.

07:02.580 --> 07:03.640
You know what? I'd prefer if you didn't.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.120
There's a lot of sensitive material in there.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.780
Great. Be careful!

07:06.890 --> 07:08.320
Time to go.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.550
I said no, and you can't access it
without my password!

07:10.660 --> 07:12.020
Already got it. Thanks!

07:12.130 --> 07:14.530
I... But the...

07:28.880 --> 07:31.780
MITCHELL: This place is deader
than a Texas salad bar.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.280
Hello!

07:47.690 --> 07:49.030
Hello!

07:50.930 --> 07:54.490
It is obvious this village
has long since been abandoned.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.940
General. What brings you by?

08:07.410 --> 08:09.810
Just thought I'd see
how you were getting along.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.140
What are you doing?

08:12.250 --> 08:15.310
Just a little research
for my upcoming mental appraisal.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.950
You can't cram
for a psychiatric evaluation.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.150
That's what they want you to think.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.790
It's a battle of wits.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.090
My mind against theirs.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.030
They'll try and confuse me
with their trick questions,

08:28.130 --> 08:31.730
but I already have the correct answers.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.400
There are no correct answers.

08:33.510 --> 08:39.640
For instance, when they ask me,
"What do you consider your biggest flaw?"

08:39.750 --> 08:41.040
No, they won't ask that question.

08:41.150 --> 08:46.110
My answer will be that I feel
I am too much of a perfectionist.

08:46.820 --> 08:51.120
You see, I put a positive spin
on a negative.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.660
Yes, that was very transparent.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.490
Question two. "You are in the desert.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.830
"You see a tortoise lying on his back
in the hot sun.

09:01.940 --> 09:07.430
"You recognize his plight,
but do nothing to help. Why?"

09:10.510 --> 09:11.740
Why?

09:13.810 --> 09:19.450
Because you are also a tortoise.

09:38.570 --> 09:41.740
Guys, you should take a look at this.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.910
Whoa.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.220
I thought I liked to sleep in.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.670
CARTER: Dr. Reimer.
REIMER: Colonel Carter, Colonel Mitchell.

10:09.770 --> 10:12.670
I understand you've got a bit of
a medical mystery on your hands.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.930
MITCHELL: What we have here
is a village full of skeletons.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.410
CARTER: We found a few
lying on the ground,

10:16.510 --> 10:18.500
but most seem to have died in their beds.

10:18.610 --> 10:20.270
I think we can rule out violence.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.210
Anything left besides bones?

10:22.320 --> 10:25.220
Sorry, Doc, whatever happened
here happened a long time ago.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.010
REIMER: Let's go take a look.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.630
Did the village records give an indication
as to what befell these people?

10:41.740 --> 10:45.330
No, but it does make mention
of some Ancient lore tied to the area.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.430
According to legend,
a cave overlooking the village

10:47.540 --> 10:49.840
was once home to Morgan Le Fay.

10:50.580 --> 10:51.700
(EX CLAIMS)

10:51.810 --> 10:54.750
In Arthurian myth,
Morgan was a powerful sorceress.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.870
King Arthur's half-sister
and an adversary of Merlin.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.680
That would suggest
she may have had a hand in

10:59.790 --> 11:01.580
the disappearance of the weapon we seek.

11:01.690 --> 11:04.680
Now, Morgan, like Merlin,
was a purported magic-user,

11:04.790 --> 11:07.730
so it makes sense that, again like Merlin,
she was once Ascended.

11:07.830 --> 11:10.320
One who foresaw the dangers
presented to her and her kind

11:10.430 --> 11:12.960
by a weapon capable
of destroying Ascended beings.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.560
So she took the weapon from Merlin
and went into hiding.

11:15.670 --> 11:18.870
On three possible worlds. This being one.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.500
We've got to find that cave.

11:26.650 --> 11:28.880
Why did I have to tag along
on this little hike?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.310
You got somewhere else you need to be?

11:31.420 --> 11:33.350
Yeah, how about at home in bed?

11:33.450 --> 11:37.720
I got pulled off inoculation duty on 865
to come here and pull a double shift.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.850
I've been up 18 hours straight.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.360
What is it?

11:46.670 --> 11:47.960
Birds.

11:49.770 --> 11:51.530
What birds?

11:51.640 --> 11:57.300
My point exactly. I first noticed it in
the village, now here in the forest as well.

11:57.410 --> 11:59.710
An unusual stillness.

11:59.810 --> 12:04.480
There are no birds,
or any other animal life, for that matter.

12:04.580 --> 12:07.880
All right. So what happened to them?

12:18.670 --> 12:22.530
Vala. I'm Dr. Hutchison.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.070
Have a seat.

12:26.970 --> 12:29.340
So, how are you feeling?

12:29.440 --> 12:32.170
Very well. Very well.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.310
Well, you know, all things considered.

12:36.220 --> 12:39.850
I mean, you'd assume I'd be a prime
candidate for acculturation difficulty,

12:39.950 --> 12:44.580
enduring feelings
of displacement and alienation.

12:44.690 --> 12:48.060
Perhaps even a little paranoid ideation.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.830
But the truth is
I was able to adopt an abstract attitude,

12:53.930 --> 12:57.490
which allowed me to release
some of my repressed feelings,

12:57.600 --> 13:00.840
ultimately providing me
with a cathartic actualization.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.200
How are you feeling?

13:03.980 --> 13:05.440
I'm fine.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.580
There's nothing here.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.990
Maybe it's the wrong cavern.
We should continue searching the area.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.290
CARTER: It's getting dark out, Daniel.
We should head back to the village.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.730
Ackerman.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.630
Yo, Ackerman! Wake up.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.260
- What happened?
- We're done.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.980
Sorry, Jackson.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.690
Are you familiar with inkblot tests?

13:50.790 --> 13:53.730
Okay. I'm going to show you
a series of images,

13:53.830 --> 13:57.490
and I just want you to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.860
Okay.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.160
Courage.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.300
Respect.

14:14.310 --> 14:18.980
You look at this inkblot and the first
thing that pops into your head is respect?

14:19.090 --> 14:21.110
Yes. Respect.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.420
Okay. Vala, this is called a projective test.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.090
It's designed to allow me a little insight
into your emotional state.

14:28.190 --> 14:31.650
I just want to get to know you better,
not pass judgment on you.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.700
I want to help, but to do that, I'm going to
need you to be completely honest

14:35.800 --> 14:38.500
and spontaneous with your answers.
Do you understand?

14:38.610 --> 14:39.900
- Of course.
- Okay.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.630
I'm sorry.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.910
Kindness.

14:56.190 --> 14:58.490
Red team's wrapping it up.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.420
Figured we'd do the same.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.360
This can't be a dead end.
There has to be something here.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.420
Take it up with Landry.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.970
You can come back tomorrow,
knock yourself out,

15:09.070 --> 15:11.090
strain your eyes all you want.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.440
You're right. I could probably
get a fresh start in the morning.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.020
All right, let's go home.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.950
GRIMSBY: Hang on a minute.
Where's Ackerman?

15:30.060 --> 15:34.650
Ackerman, come on! Bernie!

15:42.170 --> 15:44.530
Ackerman. Let's go.

15:48.310 --> 15:51.840
Yo, Ackerman! Wake up. Come on.

16:03.820 --> 16:08.190
MITCHELL: He's asleep.
What the hell kind of diagnosis is that?

16:08.290 --> 16:11.530
Dr. Reimer says he won't know more
until he's completed all the blood work.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.290
There's got to be something more to it,
like a coma.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.770
REIMER: No, I'm afraid not.

16:16.870 --> 16:21.000
Coma patients don't respond to
outside stimuli. Pain, sound, touch.

16:21.110 --> 16:25.510
Ackerman responds to all three.
He even flinches, reacts in his sleep state.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.940
- Why can't we wake him up?
- I don't know.

16:28.050 --> 16:30.810
I need to do more tests
before I can say anything for sure,

16:30.920 --> 16:32.350
and we have to contact
Stargate Command

16:32.450 --> 16:34.580
and have them send out
the necessary equipment.

16:34.690 --> 16:38.450
I'm sorry, is that not something
you'd be better off doing back at the base?

16:38.560 --> 16:43.260
Ideally, yes, but, unfortunately,
and just like Ackerman here,

16:43.360 --> 16:45.800
all of our blood work
shows an elevated white cell count

16:45.900 --> 16:48.300
and a marked increase in serotonin levels.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.860
Whatever it is, we've all been infected.

16:53.110 --> 16:56.010
You think this is the same thing
that killed the villagers?

16:56.110 --> 16:58.270
Let's just say, for the time being,

16:58.380 --> 17:02.080
I recommend we all try and stay awake
for as long as possible.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.910
If we fall asleep, we may never wake up.

17:11.860 --> 17:14.760
We're sending the medical supplies
through now, Colonel.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.090
<i>MITCHELL: Roger that, sir.</i>

17:16.200 --> 17:19.930
Sure you don't want a little more help?
I can send another team in Hazmat.

17:20.030 --> 17:23.370
<i>Until we know what we're dealing with,</i>
<i>sir, that would just be risking more lives.</i>

17:23.470 --> 17:26.060
<i>- We can handle it.</i>
- Understood.

17:34.550 --> 17:37.410
I'm awake. I'm awake.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.050
Compliments of Dr. Lam.

17:41.150 --> 17:46.960
We have dextroampheta-something,

17:47.060 --> 17:53.000
moto-whatchamacallit, caffeine pills,
and good old-fashioned coffee.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.260
Go easy there, Grimsby.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.600
How long have you been awake for?

17:59.710 --> 18:02.000
I don't know, what, 24 hours?

18:02.110 --> 18:04.410
Yeah, talk to me when you get to 40.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.880
- You've pulled all-nighters before, right?
- Yeah, loads of them.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.980
This feels worse, doesn't it?

18:16.020 --> 18:17.250
Yeah, I thought it was only me.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.480
I, too, am more fatigued
than I would have expected.

18:19.590 --> 18:21.080
It has to be the infection.

18:21.190 --> 18:22.820
It doesn't just keep you from waking up,

18:22.930 --> 18:25.450
it makes you want to sleep
in the first place.

18:25.570 --> 18:28.360
Well, in that case, Teal'c?

18:28.470 --> 18:30.730
I prefer to rely on my tretonin.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.930
Cheers. Reimer.

18:36.180 --> 18:39.170
- What you got?
- Since we started monitoring him,

18:39.280 --> 18:40.970
Ackerman has been in Stage 4 level,

18:41.080 --> 18:44.880
what they call delta sleep
or slow-wave sleep.

18:44.980 --> 18:49.110
We also noted that his brain is producing
a surprising amount of melatonin.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.560
It's a hormone synthesized from serotonin,
a sleep-inducing agent.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.180
That's what's keeping him asleep.

18:54.290 --> 18:57.390
So all you've got to do is figure out
why his brain is producing the melatonin.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.190
We're working on it.

19:01.430 --> 19:05.130
Jackson, what did you find
in the town records?

19:05.240 --> 19:07.070
A handwritten entry
from the village doctor

19:07.170 --> 19:10.040
in which he mentions a sleeping sickness
that affected the town.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.800
Now, he doesn't go into any great detail

19:11.910 --> 19:14.850
but it does make mention of
a possible source for what was happening.

19:14.950 --> 19:18.010
Morgan Le Fay.
See, it seems the villagers believed

19:18.120 --> 19:19.710
she cursed them
for revealing her whereabouts

19:19.820 --> 19:22.310
when King Arthur and his knights
came looking for her.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.190
- So did Arthur find her here?
- JACKSON: Probably not.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.690
If the villagers believed she cursed them,
then it's more than likely she escaped.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.190
In any case,
we have to go back to that cave.

19:35.100 --> 19:39.830
General, just wondering if they've reached
a decision on my mental well-being yet.

19:39.940 --> 19:44.140
Dr. Hutchison isn't finished with you yet.
You're to meet with him again later today.

19:47.710 --> 19:48.700
(SIGHS)

19:48.810 --> 19:51.250
If I may speak candidly, General.

19:51.880 --> 19:56.620
I have a feeling that
Dr. Hutchison is somewhat troubled.

19:56.720 --> 20:01.160
In fact, I think he may be suffering
from Klinefelter syndrome,

20:01.260 --> 20:03.020
though you didn't hear it from me.

20:03.130 --> 20:07.590
The only thing Dr. Hutchison is suffering
from is the headache you gave him.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.730
I suggest you stop playing games and
start taking this evaluation very seriously.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.100
I thought I was.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.830
Let's call that delusional memory.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.210
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:26.820 --> 20:28.150
MITCHELL: You know,
it was Jackson's idea

20:28.250 --> 20:30.120
to come back here
and check this cave out again.

20:30.220 --> 20:33.090
I can't help noticing he's the only one
who didn't make the trip.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.520
TEAL'C: Daniel Jackson made it clear
that his time would be better spent

20:35.630 --> 20:38.190
continuing his research
of the town records.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.160
CARTER: Here.

20:42.070 --> 20:45.300
Dr. Reimer wanted us
to take some soil samples.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.230
Why?

20:47.340 --> 20:50.370
Just in case this is where
Ackerman picked up the infection.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.310
(BEEPING)

21:03.390 --> 21:04.410
Hmm.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.290
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

21:08.390 --> 21:09.790
Hello.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.060
Hello. May I have a moment of your time?

21:14.170 --> 21:16.600
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just on my way out.
I've got a meeting.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.800
With Dr. Hutchison, I know.
That's why I'm here.

21:19.910 --> 21:21.400
I promise to be quick.

21:22.910 --> 21:24.470
My name is Richard Woolsey.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.980
I work for
the International Oversight Advisory,

21:27.080 --> 21:30.570
a civilian-run organization made up of
representatives from the various nations

21:30.680 --> 21:32.780
involved in the Stargate Program.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.980
And what can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?

21:35.090 --> 21:38.680
Why don't I tell you
what we can do for you.

21:40.630 --> 21:45.960
We can see to it that you pass your
psychiatric evaluation with flying colors,

21:46.070 --> 21:51.060
effectively putting any doubts Stargate
Command may have about you to rest.

21:51.170 --> 21:55.700
And what would you want in return?

21:56.480 --> 22:01.410
Just a little insight into the weekly
goings-on here at Stargate Command.

22:01.510 --> 22:06.010
You see, despite the fact that
all signatories to the Gate Alliance Treaty

22:06.120 --> 22:09.280
are de facto partners
in the Stargate Program,

22:09.390 --> 22:12.480
my employers are often left out of the loop

22:12.590 --> 22:16.220
when it comes to the more sensitive
developments here on the base.

22:16.330 --> 22:20.060
We'd just like you
to keep us updated is all.

22:20.170 --> 22:23.030
So you want me

22:24.870 --> 22:26.770
to be a spy.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.070
(CHUCKLING)

22:34.010 --> 22:36.740
I've read your file, Ms. Mal Doran.

22:36.850 --> 22:39.410
I don't think
what we're asking is that unusual

22:39.520 --> 22:42.080
for someone with such a colorful history.

22:47.530 --> 22:48.750
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:51.530 --> 22:53.050
(BEEPING)

22:53.430 --> 22:56.400
Cam, Teal'c? I think I found something.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.910
What you got?

23:02.010 --> 23:06.340
Well, it's a faint energy spike.
I almost went past without noticing it.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.220
Shazam!

23:22.960 --> 23:27.490
- I guess Daniel was right after all.
- MITCHELL: Yes, he was.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.590
We should check this out.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.430
Would it not be prudent for one of us
to return these samples to Dr. Reimer

23:33.540 --> 23:34.970
as quickly as possible?

23:35.070 --> 23:36.060
No, he's right.

23:36.180 --> 23:40.110
We're on the clock
and we have no idea how deep this hole is.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.870
All right, I'll go back.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.240
Stay in radio contact.
At least as long as you can.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.730
Do you really think these will hold me?

24:03.840 --> 24:06.960
Oh, those aren't restraints.
We're hooking you up to a polygraph.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.560
It's also known as a lie detector.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.610
It measures certain variables,
like blood pressure and heart rate,

24:12.710 --> 24:14.770
to determine
whether you're being truthful or not.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.140
Oh. I see.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.880
All right. Let's get started, then, shall we?

24:21.690 --> 24:24.350
And what's your name?

24:24.460 --> 24:26.450
Vala Mal Doran.

24:27.930 --> 24:31.230
Where did you spend the last week
on Earth?

24:31.330 --> 24:33.860
Here at Stargate Command.

24:35.700 --> 24:39.140
- Have you ever stolen anything?
- No.

24:43.510 --> 24:46.410
That depends on how you define "stolen."

24:46.510 --> 24:49.540
These are control questions
designed to gauge your reaction

24:49.650 --> 24:52.880
by eliciting both truthful
and deceptive answers from you.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.480
You're doing fine. Just

24:55.720 --> 24:56.710
try to relax.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.720
(EXHALES)

25:01.660 --> 25:04.290
You're looking very nice today.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.060
Oh, thank you.

25:07.700 --> 25:11.190
- You're looking rather dashing yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.830
I mean, nice.

25:19.910 --> 25:23.510
(STAMMERS) I mean, not objectionable.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.920
Colonel, come take a look at this.

25:37.700 --> 25:41.260
This was in that soil sample
you brought back from the cave.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.300
What is it?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.570
I believe it's a parasite.

25:47.940 --> 25:51.600
- Is it dead?
- No, it's dormant.

25:51.710 --> 25:55.580
Ackerman may have
somehow awakened one.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.650
Well, how? It doesn't seem
to respond to movement.

25:58.750 --> 26:02.620
Excuse me. Let's see what happens

26:05.090 --> 26:09.720
when they come in contact
with live tissue.

26:19.170 --> 26:20.400
Whoa.

26:21.210 --> 26:24.940
I'll lay odds that's your culprit right there.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.540
These people would have
had no understanding of microbiology.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.480
They probably came up
with the story of Morgan's curse

26:30.580 --> 26:33.420
because they couldn't comprehend
what was happening to them.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.320
CARTER: Hey.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.080
Where's Grimsby?

26:41.190 --> 26:44.790
He said he was on his way back.
He isn't here?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.630
Oh, no.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.810
Perhaps we should rest.

27:05.780 --> 27:09.580
No. That's a bad idea.

27:10.220 --> 27:11.750
And I am starting to regret staying up late

27:11.860 --> 27:15.380
to watch <i>Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo</i>
last night.

27:15.490 --> 27:18.400
Check that,
I regretted it almost immediately.

27:18.530 --> 27:20.050
(FAINT RUSTLING)

27:22.100 --> 27:25.260
- Am I imagining things, or...
- I heard it as well.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.000
Grimsby!

27:41.320 --> 27:42.950
Sam?

27:55.630 --> 27:59.470
JACKSON: Well, we found Grimsby.
He's asleep, and we can't wake him.

28:02.370 --> 28:03.840
Dr. Reimer?

28:07.850 --> 28:10.580
What's wrong? Has his condition changed?

28:10.680 --> 28:12.710
Well, you could say that.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.720
He's dead.

28:26.270 --> 28:30.460
REIMER: I see evidence of a ruptured
aneurysm near the pineal gland.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.400
There's something else in here.

28:40.210 --> 28:41.740
REIMER: What the hell?

28:42.450 --> 28:45.880
Morphology is identical to the parasite
we found in the soil sample.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.680
Only it's grown 1,000 times bigger.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.420
I'm assuming things didn't go well.

29:11.940 --> 29:15.780
I fail to see the point
of that ridiculous exercise,

29:16.620 --> 29:19.710
unless its purpose was
to thoroughly humiliate me.

29:21.550 --> 29:24.180
Those questions weren't intended
to shed light on my character

29:24.290 --> 29:28.590
or delve deeply into my subconscious.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.430
They were merely little reminders
as to exactly why

29:35.200 --> 29:36.570
I don't belong here.

29:39.940 --> 29:44.500
Then I take it you've carefully considered
our offer and come to a decision?

29:47.310 --> 29:48.780
I have.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.920
Whoa.

30:07.630 --> 30:08.960
(EX CLAIMS)

30:12.540 --> 30:15.170
MITCHELL: Okay, question.

30:16.310 --> 30:21.750
If what took out the village
is what killed all the wildlife around here,

30:21.850 --> 30:25.010
how come that little sucker's
alive and kicking?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.750
It may possess a natural immunity
to this mysterious affliction.

30:27.850 --> 30:28.950
Yeah, that's exactly my point.

30:29.050 --> 30:35.190
So, all we got to do
is catch Joe Bob there,

30:35.860 --> 30:39.990
take him back up to Carter and Reemer...
Reimer, whatever.

30:40.100 --> 30:45.470
They reverse-engineer an antidote and
Bob's your uncle. We sleep till Tuesday.

30:45.570 --> 30:46.600
TEAL'C: Indeed.

30:47.270 --> 30:48.240
Yeah.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.710
Carter, it's Mitchell.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.280
(RADIO STATIC)

30:56.350 --> 30:59.040
We have progressed too far
within the cave system.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.880
Yes, we have.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.010
All right, well, we'll nab Junior first,

31:04.120 --> 31:07.220
then we'll call Carter
when we get back up to the surface.

31:28.010 --> 31:29.640
Progress?

31:29.750 --> 31:33.550
We've been theorizing that when
the parasite enters the bloodstream,

31:33.650 --> 31:37.920
it triggers the body's immune response
and the production of serotonin.

31:38.020 --> 31:43.190
Then it makes its way to the patient's
brain, where it lodges and feeds.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.030
Feeds?

31:47.570 --> 31:50.800
- On what?
- Melatonin.

31:50.900 --> 31:54.300
Our analysis showed the parasite
we removed from Ackerman

31:54.410 --> 31:55.810
gorged itself on the stuff.

31:55.910 --> 31:58.540
CARTER: It stimulates the production
of melatonin, which floods the body,

31:58.640 --> 32:01.280
that's why the urge to sleep
is so powerful.

32:01.280 --> 32:01.770
That's why the urge to sleep
is so powerful.

32:01.880 --> 32:06.110
And once you give in,
the parasite just keeps on feeding

32:10.190 --> 32:13.490
until the engorged parasite affects
the surrounding cranial tissue,

32:13.590 --> 32:16.650
eventually provoking a lethal aneurysm.

32:16.760 --> 32:22.220
But we're thinking that it may be possible
to starve out the parasite,

32:22.330 --> 32:23.930
so, to that end,

32:24.040 --> 32:27.840
we have isolated a specimen that
we awakened from a dormant state.

32:28.110 --> 32:29.160
(GROANS)

32:29.540 --> 32:32.600
Dr. Reimer? Dr. Reimer!

32:36.050 --> 32:37.680
It's his heart!

33:02.910 --> 33:04.380
Sam...

33:06.350 --> 33:07.900
He's dead.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.320
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ah, Vala.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.550
Oh, not you again.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.600
You know, you have
another scheduled appointment.

33:25.700 --> 33:26.720
What would be the point of that?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.860
You people have already made up
your minds about me.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.370
Is that what you think?

33:30.470 --> 33:33.130
Well, it's not like I haven't encountered
this sort of thing before.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.000
You know, I saw it every day
in the eyes of the people

33:35.110 --> 33:38.080
who couldn't separate me
from the Goa'uld who enslaved them.

33:38.180 --> 33:41.870
So, you know, instead of becoming
a victim of their arrogance and stupidity,

33:41.980 --> 33:46.140
I chose to take advantage of it.
So I lied, I cheated, and I stole.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.710
I'm not going to apologize for it
and, to be perfectly honest with you,

33:49.820 --> 33:53.550
I can't guarantee that I won't do it again.
All right?

33:54.690 --> 33:58.560
Of course, I have recently
found myself risking my life

33:58.660 --> 34:01.030
for something other
than my own personal benefit.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.530
Maybe it's just a phase. Hold it, please.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.800
Or maybe it's because, for the first time,
I've actually met someone

34:06.910 --> 34:09.930
who, in some small way,
actually believes in me,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.840
but I'm sure you're right.
I'm sure it will pass.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.210
What?

34:18.680 --> 34:20.210
CARTER: Daniel!

34:20.790 --> 34:24.050
- You can't fall asleep. Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

34:27.660 --> 34:30.060
We can't take any more of these, either.

34:30.160 --> 34:34.290
With our serotonin and melatonin levels
spiking, it's too dangerous.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.960
We're going to have to rely on each other,
all right?

34:38.140 --> 34:39.470
Okay.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.720
Easy, there.

35:07.270 --> 35:10.890
Easy. Don't worry.

35:11.470 --> 35:13.630
I'm not going to hurt you.

35:14.710 --> 35:15.970
(GRUNTS)

35:20.680 --> 35:22.870
I've got it, Colonel Mitchell!

35:30.590 --> 35:32.280
On your feet, Colonel Mitchell.

35:32.390 --> 35:35.090
There is much ground to cover
if we are to reach the surface.

35:35.190 --> 35:38.650
No, you... You go ahead without me.
I'm just going to...

35:38.760 --> 35:41.530
I'm just going to stay here. I'm cooked.

35:41.630 --> 35:44.000
Then I will carry you if I must.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.040
Forget it. No.

35:48.370 --> 35:53.240
Tretonin or not, it's going to
catch up with you at some point.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.710
The important thing for you
is to take Kermit back to Carter

35:58.480 --> 35:59.580
and what's-his-name

36:00.420 --> 36:02.110
and get them started on the cure.

36:03.020 --> 36:06.920
Indeed. I will return for you,
Colonel Mitchell.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.820
And I'll be

36:12.860 --> 36:13.850
right here

36:15.300 --> 36:16.270
waiting on you.

36:23.070 --> 36:25.440
Sam! Sam.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.270
I can't do it anymore.

36:27.380 --> 36:31.750
You have to. You got to hang in there
just a little while longer.

36:38.420 --> 36:43.360
In here! Dr. Jackson, Colonel Carter,
where's the rest of your team?

36:43.460 --> 36:45.550
Reimer and Ackerman are dead.

36:45.660 --> 36:49.290
- Teal'c and Mitchell went to the caves.
- What caves?

36:51.700 --> 36:53.930
Get them in the isolation pods.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.170
No, wait. Wait.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.180
No, wait.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.340
We can't go to sleep.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.950
It's okay. We'll take care of you.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.080
No, you don't understand.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.060
The parasite. It feeds on...

37:16.160 --> 37:17.490
(INAUDIBLE)

38:58.660 --> 39:00.100
(COUGHS)

39:01.130 --> 39:04.500
Take it easy, Teal'c. We've got you.
Take it easy.

39:07.340 --> 39:11.280
We've got some sort of animal here.
We need to take it to the lab.

39:20.420 --> 39:25.360
Yeah, I was getting worked up, cussing at
Teal'c, telling him to, "Go on. Leave me."

39:26.120 --> 39:29.460
Must have been 20 minutes
before I realized he had gone

39:29.560 --> 39:31.690
and I was sitting there talking to myself.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.530
JACKSON: What about you?
Any hallucinations?

39:34.630 --> 39:37.830
Yeah, when they put me in the pod,
I imagined I was being put in a coffin.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.490
I thought I was being buried alive.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.940
Well, rise and shine. How are you feeling?

39:43.040 --> 39:44.630
Rested and raring to go, sir.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.610
I assume Dr. Lam got you up to speed.

39:46.710 --> 39:47.740
CARTER: Yes, sir.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.400
Between the sample
they collected from Teal'c

39:49.510 --> 39:51.680
and the research
Dr. Reimer and I conducted,

39:51.780 --> 39:54.750
they were able to produce a serum
that effectively isolated the parasite

39:54.850 --> 39:55.840
and starved it out.

39:55.950 --> 39:59.390
I just hate that that cave was a dead end.
We went through all that for nothing.

39:59.490 --> 40:00.890
JACKSON: I wouldn't say that exactly.

40:00.990 --> 40:03.550
I did find one reference in that library
that might prove to be useful.

40:04.430 --> 40:05.520
Atlantis.

40:05.630 --> 40:08.620
You think the location of Merlin's weapon
is hidden in their database?

40:08.730 --> 40:10.500
I think it's worth checking out.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.900
(PHONE RINGING)

40:14.870 --> 40:15.930
Carter.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.940
I see. We'll be right there.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.480
There seems to be a problem
in the gate room, sir.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.820
I never liked you
and I know you can hear me.

40:30.920 --> 40:34.860
Dial the gate now! Dial the gate!

40:34.960 --> 40:37.220
Don't make me come in there! You stop it.

40:37.330 --> 40:38.760
What's going on?

40:39.900 --> 40:41.260
I'm leaving.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.130
I'm not staying somewhere
where I'm not welcome,

40:43.230 --> 40:45.900
and don't even think about
making me stay against my will.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.730
Wouldn't dream of it.
But I figured you'd want to stay

40:48.840 --> 40:52.670
after going through all the trouble
of passing the psychiatric evaluation.

40:54.150 --> 40:55.240
I passed?

40:55.350 --> 40:58.870
Dr. Hutchison seems to think
that you have a lot of potential.

41:00.220 --> 41:01.240
He does?

41:01.350 --> 41:05.520
He feels you can make a significant
contribution here at Stargate Command,

41:05.620 --> 41:07.060
and I agree.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.590
Congratulations.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.830
I'm a little

41:20.740 --> 41:21.830
overwhelmed.

41:24.340 --> 41:30.180
But as my first official act, I'd like to
report a rather disagreeable little man.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.680
That would be me.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.680
Mr. Woolsey's offer was part of the test.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.080
We wanted to make sure
we could trust you.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.990
I knew that, but were his sexual advances
part of the test?

41:42.090 --> 41:44.720
What? That's... General, I can assure you...

41:44.830 --> 41:46.890
Well, I would have even
considered playing along,

41:47.000 --> 41:48.690
but some of his requests were...

41:48.800 --> 41:52.700
Well, a little unusual, even for me.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.610
General, I would never...
General... General, wait...

41:59.140 --> 42:02.810
So when do I get
one of these SG-1 badges?

42:02.910 --> 42:06.940
You don't. You're not a member of SG-1.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.650
You're a probationary member
of Stargate Command

42:09.750 --> 42:14.090
who will be subject to some very intensive
scrutiny for the next few months.

42:14.190 --> 42:15.320
Oh.

42:16.290 --> 42:17.850
Don't screw up.

42:24.340 --> 42:26.030
And welcome aboard.

42:27.940 --> 42:33.040
See, I still think it's cause for celebration,
so I say we go out, have lunch, and I'll pay.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.440
Pay with what, exactly?

42:35.550 --> 42:39.040
Well, Daniel will cover me
until I get my share of the loot.

42:41.220 --> 42:43.080
Loot?

42:43.190 --> 42:47.450
Yeah, from all the treasures we're going
to bring back from our off-world travels.

42:48.590 --> 42:52.790
What, I have to wait until I'm off probation
before I can start collecting?
