I'll be a good father, Meg,

I promise you that.

best for our wee boy.

threw my Action Man
in the loch.

02:13.737 --> 02:16.573
He went in after it
two minutes later.

Of course,
we were only 16 at the time.

02:40.930 --> 02:45.143

02:59.324 --> 03:00.533
It was irresistible.

03:00.617 --> 03:03.203
And very, very slow.

DONALD:
Oh, but it was such fun,
eh, Molly?

a few pints down at The

I'll be kind of sorry.

you'd drop off the down

Not just on a horse, on life!

you put me up to it.

-I didn't.
-No, no, no, no.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.084
No, there's only
one thing for it.

You are going to have
to get a job, pal.

04:36.546 --> 04:37.672

04:42.427 --> 04:44.679
So, what's the form with these

04:44.763 --> 04:46.556
The form?

04:46.638 --> 04:49.434
Well, it's an ancient
Highland ritual.

You don't say.

04:52.520 --> 04:57.192
Where the tenants present
the laird with an extremely
long list of grievances.

04:57.275 --> 04:58.902
I was worried
you were going to say that.

04:58.985 --> 05:03.239
Yeah, that's when the
laird suffers an acute
case of deafness.

What can I say?

06:09.222 --> 06:11.182

for a start.

06:11.266 --> 06:13.184

Aye, that'll do just fine.

06:18.148 --> 06:20.609

in these parts,

repairs to your crofts
has lengthened somewhat.

Well, let's see if we
can shorten it, somewhat.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.887
Now do you know
why you can't hold the baby?

28:23.723 --> 28:24.766
Uh...

28:28.186 --> 28:29.354
Sorry.

28:33.358 --> 28:34.651
He's gone down.

28:35.277 --> 28:36.778
Thanks, Rosie.

28:41.616 --> 28:43.827
So, come on.
How are you managing?

28:44.953 --> 28:46.913
I told you, we're fine.

28:48.039 --> 28:49.291
-Really?
-Really.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.877
It seems to me you're under
a lot of pressure.

28:52.961 --> 28:55.046
We get by.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.300
How long do you think
Jess is going to want to be
sharing a room with Cameron?

28:59.592 --> 29:00.969
I haven't given
it much thought.

29:01.052 --> 29:02.721
Well, maybe you should.

29:02.804 --> 29:05.348
She's loyal and caring,
but she's stuck in here

29:05.432 --> 29:07.100
when she should
be out with her friends.

29:07.183 --> 29:09.227
Cameron's her brother,
not her son.

29:09.311 --> 29:12.439
What are you trying
to say, Rosie?

29:12.522 --> 29:15.525
-Let me take care of him.
-Huh...

29:15.609 --> 29:19.279
It'll just be for a while.
Just until he's old enough
to look after himself.

29:19.362 --> 29:20.655
It's great, isn't it?

29:20.739 --> 29:22.616
First I lose Meg,
now I'm losing Cameron.

29:22.699 --> 29:24.951
You won't have lost him.

29:25.035 --> 29:27.329
He'll always be your son.
Yours and Meg's.

29:27.412 --> 29:30.248
-Nothing can ever change that.
-Nothing.

29:30.332 --> 29:32.876
-Nothing.
-Think about it.

29:32.959 --> 29:34.586
-I've spoken to Alec...
-Have you?

29:37.505 --> 29:39.716
What do you think
Meg would have wanted?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.595
I can't answer that
question, Golly.

29:45.639 --> 29:46.806
No.

29:59.110 --> 30:02.989
I'm only thinking of
Cameron's best interests.
Give it a thought.

30:06.826 --> 30:08.662
PAUL ON RADIO:
Golly, come in.

30:12.916 --> 30:14.542
Golly, come in.

30:14.626 --> 30:17.462
-Golly, where are you?
-Golly here. Go ahead.

30:17.545 --> 30:20.131
There's a tree down.
It's blocking the road
at Nine Acre Wood.

30:20.215 --> 30:22.676
-It needs shifting, right now.
-On my way.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.848
-(CAR ENGINE RUMBLING)
-Rosie?

(YELLING) Rosie!

30:38.942 --> 30:41.069
(CAMERON CRYING LOUDLY)

30:42.529 --> 30:43.989
(YELLING) Molly!

30:47.450 --> 30:48.827
Molly!

30:50.120 --> 30:51.371
Molly!

30:51.454 --> 30:52.664
What is it?

30:52.747 --> 30:54.374
I was looking for Molly.

30:54.457 --> 30:56.167
She's popped down the
village for lunch.

30:56.251 --> 30:58.253
Listen, Donald...

30:58.336 --> 31:01.548
Donald, I need somebody...
I need somebody to
keep an eye on Cameron.

31:01.631 --> 31:03.216
Oh, you're not suggesting
that I do it?

31:03.300 --> 31:04.926
You need to do it, Donald.

31:05.010 --> 31:07.429
A tree has come down
across one of the roads.

31:07.512 --> 31:08.847
You'll be fine. See you later.

31:08.930 --> 31:11.016
I won't have to change
his napkin, will I?

31:11.099 --> 31:12.517
Hello, little macaroon!

31:30.535 --> 31:32.287
Sorry. Sorry.

31:32.370 --> 31:35.206
That's okay.
I'm nearly done here.

31:35.290 --> 31:38.543
We really should get this old
lot down soon, before it does
some real damage.

31:38.627 --> 31:40.587
We've made a start already.

31:40.670 --> 31:42.339
If it's a matter
of getting extra help...

31:42.422 --> 31:44.591
No, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.138
(CHAINSAW MOTOR WHIRRING)

31:51.931 --> 31:55.185
I went wide
at the left-hander,
forcing him inside,

31:55.268 --> 32:00.857
then cut in sharpish
at the next right,
a wicked right-hander.

32:00.941 --> 32:04.027
And young Stirling Moss,
he wasn't much older
than you at the time,

32:04.110 --> 32:07.572
learning from a master,
tucked neatly
into my slipstream.

32:07.656 --> 32:09.991
-I'm sorry, Donald.
-Oh, that's all right, Golly,

32:10.075 --> 32:12.619
we're getting
along splendidly.

32:12.702 --> 32:15.497
He particularly liked
the cherry brandy.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.999
-Oh, no, man!
-We were hitting
it off very well.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.918
If ever you want another
baby-squasher...

32:20.001 --> 32:22.587
-I won't. I won't.
-Oh.

32:22.671 --> 32:25.382
Pity. I like babies.

32:26.466 --> 32:29.052
Was one myself, once. Ha!

32:55.120 --> 32:56.871
Nice to see you!

32:56.955 --> 32:59.582
If you think I'm a pushover
for a plate of sausage
and mash in

32:59.666 --> 33:02.168
-a draughty old dining room...
-Sorry?

33:02.252 --> 33:04.045
You'll be wanting this.

33:04.129 --> 33:07.257
-Right.
-It's a list of all the
repairs that need doing.

33:07.340 --> 33:11.761
Not next month, not next week,
not tomorrow, but now.

33:37.037 --> 33:38.705
-Golly, hi.
-Hi.

33:39.497 --> 33:42.375
Listen, er...

33:42.459 --> 33:44.794
I've been thinking about
what you were saying about

33:45.837 --> 33:47.881
looking after Cameron.

33:47.964 --> 33:50.550
-Would you like to come in?
-No.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.302
-No, thanks.
-Mum?

33:52.385 --> 33:54.596
-Come on, Mum!
-Just a minute.

33:56.348 --> 33:59.643
Er, after the christening.

34:00.685 --> 34:01.978
Right.

34:02.062 --> 34:03.188
Okay.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.364
It was the fish fingers
that finally did for me.

34:12.447 --> 34:16.076
Then the supervisor had to
go to hospital,
second degree burns.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.703
Now they're short-staffed,
and it's all my fault.

34:18.786 --> 34:20.705
-You didn't get the job.
-Of course I did!

34:20.789 --> 34:23.541
I never doubted you,
and I may have bought
us some time.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.005
I don't need to ask how
it went then.

34:30.090 --> 34:31.507
Molly got the job!

34:33.802 --> 34:35.011
Thank you.

34:41.935 --> 34:43.770
You should never have
made her do it.

34:43.853 --> 34:46.063
I thought we were
all in this together.

34:48.108 --> 34:49.985
(PHONE RINGING)

34:50.068 --> 34:52.946
Hello? Yeah, speaking.

34:53.029 --> 34:55.282
Oh, I'm glad you called.
Where's my generator?

34:57.200 --> 34:58.326
What?

35:01.246 --> 35:02.664
Right...

35:04.082 --> 35:06.876
Well, okay, yeah. Okay.

35:07.294 --> 35:08.503

35:10.338 --> 35:11.589

35:19.180 --> 35:21.016
You didn't pay the deposit?

35:21.099 --> 35:23.018
I'm sorry. The thing is...

35:23.101 --> 35:26.187
So am I, Ewan.
Very, very sorry.

35:26.271 --> 35:27.772
I can explain!

(EXHALES)

Women! If it's not your money
they're after, it's your body.

35:34.654 --> 35:38.325
Happily,
all I have left is the latter.

35:38.408 --> 35:40.827
-This is all your fault.
-What?

35:40.910 --> 35:43.038
You don't think I can
go on holiday with
a clear conscience

35:43.121 --> 35:45.165
and let Molly just...

35:45.247 --> 35:46.541
Forget it.

36:08.939 --> 36:10.440
I'm sorry about today.

36:12.233 --> 36:13.735
And yesterday?

36:16.070 --> 36:17.989
Okay, and yesterday.

36:18.073 --> 36:19.740
And I get to hold Cameron?

36:20.492 --> 36:21.701
Duncan!

36:22.160 --> 36:23.370
Say it.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.499
And you get to hold Cameron.

36:32.045 --> 36:33.213
Right!

36:35.632 --> 36:38.134
Well, now that we've
got that out of the way,

36:38.218 --> 36:40.053
it's time we were honest
with each other.

36:40.136 --> 36:41.262
Okay.

36:43.640 --> 36:46.268
I've been lying to you, Jess.

36:46.351 --> 36:48.687
You've got another girlfriend,
haven't you?

36:51.439 --> 36:52.482
No.

36:54.234 --> 36:55.777
It's nothing as
simple as that.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.821
Well, what is it, then?
Tell me.

37:02.367 --> 37:05.036
Things haven't been going
that well in Edinburgh.

37:07.539 --> 37:10.792
The job with the hospital
radio was voluntary.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.669
I've been living
on the dole, Jess.

37:13.795 --> 37:17.132
-Well...
-No money. Scummy flat.

37:17.215 --> 37:19.259
I don't know anyone.

37:19.342 --> 37:21.803
I've never been so miserable.

37:21.886 --> 37:27.726
And every minute I'm thinking
about you, Golly, all this.

37:27.809 --> 37:29.519
Come here, Duncan.

37:31.688 --> 37:33.773
Hold on.

37:33.857 --> 37:39.154
I was all set to come back,
tail between my legs,
but who cares?

37:39.237 --> 37:42.949
And then out of the blue
I got offered a job.

37:45.285 --> 37:46.911
It's a late-night slot.

37:46.995 --> 37:50.582
You know, reps, insomniacs,

37:51.625 --> 37:54.210
stay-at-home vampires.

37:54.294 --> 37:56.755
But it's the real thing,
and it pays...

38:00.175 --> 38:01.968
And I'm due to start
next week.

38:03.553 --> 38:04.804
Oh.

38:06.014 --> 38:08.350
-Well, you know, that's great.
-No...

38:10.644 --> 38:12.646
I don't know what to do.

38:13.980 --> 38:15.649
Tell me what to do, Jess.

38:16.775 --> 38:18.068
Should I take the job?

38:20.528 --> 38:21.988
Or come home?

38:34.709 --> 38:37.921
I have missed you so much.

38:49.766 --> 38:51.351
Cameron's gonna
look great in that.

38:51.434 --> 38:54.312
Mmm-hmm. Both Archie
and Jamie did.

39:00.777 --> 39:03.655
-For me?
-It's got your name on it.

39:03.738 --> 39:05.740
Oh! And Donald.

39:05.824 --> 39:06.908
Shall I open it?

39:06.992 --> 39:08.076
Hmm.

39:11.538 --> 39:13.290
What's this?

39:13.373 --> 39:15.041
I've been saving up.

39:15.125 --> 39:17.377
It'll pay for the
first instalment
on the generator.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.296
We couldn't possibly...

39:19.379 --> 39:22.757
It won't wash, old boy.
It's full cash price
on delivery,

39:22.841 --> 39:27.470
-or candles ad infinitum.
-Yeah?

39:27.554 --> 39:30.932
Well, at least you can give
Paul his money back. Pay me
back when you like.

39:31.016 --> 39:32.267
Through thick and thin.

39:32.350 --> 39:33.852
The MacDonald way.

39:34.894 --> 39:35.979
Sweet lamb.

39:36.062 --> 39:38.315
There's no need, old boy.
Here.

39:40.650 --> 39:42.277
I followed your advice.

39:43.403 --> 39:45.363
You sold your father's watch?

39:45.447 --> 39:48.283
Well, actually, I won it at
an illegal card table
in Shepherd's Market.

39:50.243 --> 39:52.579
Like I said, Donald,
you always come
good in the end.

39:54.497 --> 39:56.249
I've got a situation
to sort out.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.876
Holiday in the sun, perchance?

39:57.959 --> 39:59.461
It's a bit late for that.

39:59.544 --> 40:02.339
Well, there are plenty more
fish in the Med, old boy.

40:06.801 --> 40:09.512
You never cease
to surprise me.

40:09.596 --> 40:12.223
Well, thick and thin,
eh, Molly?

40:12.307 --> 40:14.351
The MacDonald way.

40:14.434 --> 40:16.561
Mmm, quite.

40:16.645 --> 40:18.772
It was your father's watch,
wasn't it?

40:19.272 --> 40:20.398
Yeah.

40:23.526 --> 40:28.573
Do you remember what your
Auntie Rosie said? Do you?
Remember?

40:28.657 --> 40:31.368
She said you can come
and visit any time you fancy.

40:32.410 --> 40:35.538
Yes, any time you like.

40:35.622 --> 40:37.248
That's what she said.

40:38.208 --> 40:39.960
Any time you like.

40:40.877 --> 40:43.171
Come on, wee man.

40:43.254 --> 40:45.632
You need a proper
family around you.

40:45.715 --> 40:47.342
You do.

40:47.425 --> 40:49.636
You'll have John and Tara
to play with.

40:50.220 --> 40:51.513
You will.

40:52.555 --> 40:55.100
But you remember this, son.

40:55.183 --> 40:57.227
No matter how
big and strong you get,

40:58.561 --> 41:00.313
you'll always be my wee boy.

41:02.065 --> 41:03.692
And don't you ever forget it.

41:11.783 --> 41:15.870
Donald, there's a horse
running tomorrow.
2:30 at Windsor!

41:15.954 --> 41:19.374
-Absolutely not!
-Oh!

41:19.457 --> 41:22.752
Very well. You heard what
Paul said, cash up front.

41:22.836 --> 41:24.087
What are the odds?

41:25.547 --> 41:27.966
15-to-1.

41:28.049 --> 41:30.927
But that's not what
makes it so irresistible.

41:31.761 --> 41:34.222
It's called Golly's Boy!

41:34.306 --> 41:36.266
And if we could
buy the generator outright,

41:36.349 --> 41:39.352
it means we could make
Paul's money go
that little bit further.

41:39.436 --> 41:43.857
Strictly speaking,
dear, sweet Molly,
it's not Paul's money.

41:44.983 --> 41:46.192
Donald!

42:03.209 --> 42:06.838
Oh, Paul. You're keen.

42:08.298 --> 42:10.925
Yeah, well, it's on your list.

42:12.719 --> 42:15.138
Well, you know, I'd offer
you a cup of tea,

42:15.221 --> 42:16.848
but the kettle's just
blown another fuse.

42:29.069 --> 42:30.362
I can manage!

42:38.453 --> 42:40.497
Right, I've finished.

42:40.580 --> 42:43.124
It's a patch job, but it
should hold until we can
afford to get Mr Brown back.

42:44.292 --> 42:45.794
And when will that be?

42:47.170 --> 42:48.755
You tell me, Madam Chair.

42:51.466 --> 42:55.053
Look, maybe we should
start again if we're
to work together, eh?

43:01.101 --> 43:03.561
I could make you that
cup of tea now.

43:03.645 --> 43:06.606
No, thank you,
I've got a busy day.
Christening. See you.

43:07.649 --> 43:08.775
Bye.

43:13.405 --> 43:15.657
Your mother would have
been so proud, son.

43:16.908 --> 43:18.285
Afternoon.

43:18.368 --> 43:19.828
Paul!

43:19.911 --> 43:21.955
Molly wanted you to have this.

43:22.038 --> 43:24.207
The MacDonald
christening shawl.

43:24.291 --> 43:26.418
It's... It's beautiful.

43:26.501 --> 43:27.919
Thank you.

43:28.003 --> 43:29.296
Hi.

43:29.379 --> 43:31.673
Where are all of
Cameron's things?

43:31.756 --> 43:34.509
-Packed.
-Packed?

43:34.592 --> 43:40.557
(SIGHS) Look. It was stupid
of me to think that I could
bring him up on my own.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.976
What's a wee boy want
with an old man like me?

43:44.936 --> 43:46.396
You're his father, Golly.

43:46.479 --> 43:49.316
Yeah. When he's hitting his
teens I'll be pushing 70.

43:49.399 --> 43:52.277
What use will that be to him?

43:52.360 --> 43:57.991
No. No, Rosie and Alec and
the kids, they can give
him a proper family.

43:58.074 --> 44:01.036
Rosie. And we can't,
I suppose?

44:01.119 --> 44:03.496
PAUL: I thought we were
family, Golly.

44:03.580 --> 44:04.748
All of us.

44:04.831 --> 44:06.791
He can come home
and visit any time.

44:07.584 --> 44:09.836
Any time.

44:09.919 --> 44:12.422
-It's for the best, Jess.
-Best for who, exactly?

44:12.505 --> 44:13.590
Cameron. For yourself.

44:13.673 --> 44:16.134
-Oh, me?
-Yes!

44:16.217 --> 44:17.969
You don't want to be
tied down up here
all the time.

44:18.053 --> 44:22.599
No, Dad. So what if
I'd sometimes rather be
out than baby-sitting?

44:22.682 --> 44:24.935
And, yes, I may not
exactly relish sleeping
in a nursery.

44:25.018 --> 44:26.937
Sometimes I might wish
things were different.

44:27.020 --> 44:29.439
But that counts for nothing
if it means
losing Cameron.

44:29.522 --> 44:30.649
My mind's made up.

44:35.487 --> 44:36.613
When?

44:38.323 --> 44:39.491
Today.

44:40.492 --> 44:41.952
After the christening.

44:42.035 --> 44:44.162
Because we mustn't
mess with tradition.

44:44.245 --> 44:46.122
Well, there's another
tradition we mustn't
mess with, Dad.

44:46.206 --> 44:48.249
And that's you walking out
on your children.

44:48.333 --> 44:51.294
You're doing to him exactly
what you did to me.

44:51.378 --> 44:53.046
Hold on! Hold on, both of you.

44:54.923 --> 44:56.466
Golly, you need to
see something.

44:58.510 --> 44:59.886
DONALD:
I think this engine was mine.

44:59.970 --> 45:02.597
DUNCAN: No, that was Hector's
and he gave it to me.

45:02.681 --> 45:04.432
DONALD:
I don't believe he'd give
my engine to you.

45:04.516 --> 45:06.476
Yes, he gave it to me.

45:06.559 --> 45:09.521
He said I was a true and
proper inheritor of
stationmaster of Glenbogle.

45:09.604 --> 45:10.730
-I...
-(DOOR OPENS)

45:13.358 --> 45:14.526
Golly!

45:15.777 --> 45:17.445
What's all this?

45:17.529 --> 45:20.365
-It's Cameron's
christening present.
-It was Duncan's idea.

45:23.535 --> 45:25.829
This is where my godson
can do his growing up.

45:28.373 --> 45:33.211
We hoped this would be
Cameron's home from home.

45:33.295 --> 45:35.797
A place where we can
all watch over him.

45:37.507 --> 45:38.883
His family.

45:41.219 --> 45:42.762
What do you reckon, Golly?

45:54.274 --> 45:55.692
I don't know what to say.

46:17.464 --> 46:18.923
(STUTTERS) Um, I...

46:19.007 --> 46:21.593
I'd just like to say
before we begin

46:21.676 --> 46:27.390
that if Golly's half as good
a dad to Cameron
as he was to me,

46:27.474 --> 46:30.644
then Cameron's
a really lucky lad.

46:30.727 --> 46:32.103
-Hear, hear.
-Thanks, son.

46:34.439 --> 46:37.359
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit.

You're gonna need all three.

46:39.027 --> 46:41.529
ALL: Amen.

46:41.613 --> 46:46.159
The Gospel tells us that
Jesus was baptised
in the Jordan by John.

46:46.242 --> 46:48.662
As he was coming
up out of the water,

46:48.745 --> 46:52.958
he saw the heavens break
open and the Spirit descend
on him like a dove.

46:54.125 --> 46:56.461
And a voice came from Heaven,

46:56.544 --> 47:00.966
"You are my beloved Son,
in you I take delight."

not entirely useless,
Your Lairdship.

47:29.244 --> 47:33.373
Cameron Jamie Mackenzie,
I baptise you in the name
of the Father,

47:33.456 --> 47:36.459

47:36.543 --> 47:39.379
May the blessing of
God Almighty,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,

47:39.462 --> 47:42.465
descend upon you and dwell
in your heart for ever.

47:43.091 --> 47:44.175

Donald?

48:33.058 --> 48:34.559
The generator?

48:35.560 --> 48:37.479
Haven't you told him?

48:37.562 --> 48:39.981
There was something
of a misunderstanding
about the deposit, old son.

48:40.065 --> 48:43.777
You see, Donald came into
some money and he thought
wouldn't it be nice

48:43.860 --> 48:46.029
to buy the generator outright.

48:46.112 --> 48:48.448

I've been called many things
in my life, mostly insults,
but never a hero. Thank you.

49:04.965 --> 49:06.591
I thought you weren't coming.

Well, I had to wait for
my dad to give me a lift.

It's okay, he's gone.

49:11.930 --> 49:15.725
Anyway, the holiday
we didn't get because you
messed up the deposit?

49:15.809 --> 49:17.560
I said I was sorry.

49:17.644 --> 49:21.314
Well, my mum and dad saw
the advert in the paper, too.

49:21.398 --> 49:24.317
They were gonna be in Ibiza
the same time as we were.

49:24.401 --> 49:26.152
Your dad would have
been there?

49:26.236 --> 49:30.991
Which means I've got the house
to myself for two weeks.

-Quality time.
-Mmm-hmm!

49:40.166 --> 49:43.253
Right. I have been doing
some thinking.

I've warned you about that.
No good'll come of it.

Shut up, Duncan,
this is important.

49:53.054 --> 49:54.848
