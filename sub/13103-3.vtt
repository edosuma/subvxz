WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.207
(pounding)

00:02.252 --> 00:04.743
Open up! Dad, are you in there?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.470
(beep, speed-dials)

00:15.516 --> 00:17.131
(click)

00:17.184 --> 00:19.140
(man) This is Tommy.
Leave a message.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.767
Augh.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.518
(Andy) Dad...

00:29.196 --> 00:30.811
(whack)

00:30.864 --> 00:33.196
(glass shatters)

00:34.826 --> 00:37.818
(panting)

00:42.376 --> 00:46.585
(glass clinking)

00:46.630 --> 00:49.542
Dad, come on.
Come on, please wake up.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.001
Come on, get up. Please!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.507
(slaps face) Dad, get up!

00:52.553 --> 00:55.465
Get up!

00:55.514 --> 00:57.345
Hey. You're okay.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.097
You're okay.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.884
(grunts)

01:01.937 --> 01:03.177
What are you doin' here?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.221
We were supposed to meet for lunch.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.310
I called you, like, 18 times.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.983
The phone's off.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.860
(horn honks in distance)

01:12.906 --> 01:15.613
Hey. What's going on with my window?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.775
Like I said, you didn't answer my calls.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.992
So?

01:20.038 --> 01:22.074
You know, what is wrong with you?

01:22.124 --> 01:23.864
You know, this is exactly
what happened last year

01:23.917 --> 01:26.374
when I found you with a bunch
of booze and sleeping pills.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.706
- Come on!
- It's okay.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.541
It's okay. lt-it's fine.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.252
I'm glad you got me up.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.541
Dad, it's not fine.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.175
(grunts) l, uh...

01:35.220 --> 01:36.721
(exhales deeply)

01:36.763 --> 01:40.051
I promised I would help set up Fite Nite.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.011
You're going to Fite Nite?

01:42.060 --> 01:47.475
Well, it's a fund-raiser for retired cops.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.567
I'm a retired cop.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.194
Yeah, and you haven't gone since.

01:54.239 --> 01:59.609
Well, it wasn't exactly
a... gold watch exit, you know?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.282
Look, don't worry.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.489
I'm not gonna drink. Not tonight.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.376
It's a new leaf, I swear.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.416
Come on. Help me out, will ya?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.096
- Come on. Keep moving.
- I am moving.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.806
There you go. All right,
but keep your guard up, all right?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.186
You don't want to get hurt,
you gotta protect yourself.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.220
There you go.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.390
Do you guys realize
that a rookie from 15 division

02:31.443 --> 02:34.480
has won Fite Nite every year
for the last... 12 years?

02:34.780 --> 02:37.988
Jab, jab, cross.
There you go. That's good.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.866
Man, if you lose,
everybody is gonna hate you.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.402
- Jab, jab, cross, all right? Oh!
- Sorry!

02:43.455 --> 02:44.991
- What are you--
- Sorry! Man!

02:45.540 --> 02:46.871
Dov, you're not helpin'.

02:48.377 --> 02:52.211
Hey, guys, you know,
there's a briefing in 20, right?

02:52.464 --> 02:55.547
You know, even if you don't win,
they'll still respect you.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.877
Good luck.
(door creaks)

02:58.845 --> 03:00.346
(sighs) Bitch.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.550
Hey, hey, come on.
Shake it off. Let's go.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.510
Come on. One, one, two.
All right? Those swipes comin'.

03:05.686 --> 03:10.100
These bullets are designed
to go through your vests.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.108
They're designed to kill police.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.936
That's their purpose.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.021
2 cops killed in what,
the last 18 months?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.278
(lowered voice)
Hey. What happened to you?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.405
- It's a long story.
- Officer McNally.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.065
Good lunch? Tasty dessert?

03:22.119 --> 03:24.576
- Sorry I'm late, sir.
- You guys are eyes only.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.408
Anything goes down, you call it in.
You sit tight.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.491
You know your assignments.
Nash, Epstein, you're in the truck.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.875
Diaz, you're here with me.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.036
Peck, McNally,
you're on the back of the building.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.080
Peck, since you were here for the briefing,

03:36.883 --> 03:38.043
you're in charge back there.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.088
All right, kids, we roll in five.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.510
Give me five minutes to get cleaned up, okay?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.716
Yeah, take your time.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.673
(police radio chatter,
indistinct conversations)

03:47.519 --> 03:48.634
Hey.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.723
Hey. It's you.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.433
I can see how you made detective.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.393
Hey, you, uh, you going to Fite Nite?

03:54.443 --> 03:55.979
Yeah, soon as I'm off shift.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.859
Um, actually, my friend Traci's fighting.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.566
Chris has been coaching her
all week. Are you goin'?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.027
I got a suspect in interview,
but if I ever get done, yeah.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.907
- McNally, step it up!
- Gotta go.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.203
(clears throat)

04:10.041 --> 04:13.750
(woman on radio) Can I get a radio check
on channel 2 for all tango units?

04:16.381 --> 04:18.497
This is Epstein.
We've got eyes on our U.C.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.374
(man) Tango 4. Check.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.963
(dog barking in distance)

04:22.012 --> 04:23.252
(woman) Tango 3.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.255
(man) He's approaching
the front doors of the building.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.345
(Jerry) Okay, let's get settled.
Here we go.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.147
No way. That's Boyd?
He's gotta be 20 pounds lighter.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.354
Yeah, U.C. looks good on him.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.392
(Chris) That's our guy?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.686
(Jerry) No, that's my guy.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.900
He's been working Beljac
for three months now...

04:42.949 --> 04:44.450
who should be here any minute.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.609
- Can he hear you?
- We can't give him an earpiece.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.276
That's why we got the apartment wired.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.072
Good. Okay, let's clear
the operational channel.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.205
(static)

04:53.251 --> 04:54.661
(adjusts level, static gets louder)

04:54.795 --> 04:55.784
What's wrong with the level?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.169
(frequencies squealing)

04:58.215 --> 05:00.627
Whoa. Hello, bad guy.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.882
You have any bullets / might purchase?

05:02.928 --> 05:05.590
Oh, yes, ldo.
Here ’s some money.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.470
Uh, would you like to count said money?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.260
Yeah, well, / guess--l guess / should.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.143
20, 40, 60, 80. You guys getting this?
Check check check?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.645
Okay, well, here's the party.
Is that Boyd?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.555
I thought the camera added 10 pounds.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.815
Don't you have work?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.976
Yeah, papenNork. Buddy, it's the worst.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.229
Okay, SWAT's teed up. How about eyes?

05:23.281 --> 05:24.896
Two in the building, two in the bucket.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.069
You definitely drew the long straw.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.324
I know. It's awesome.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.203
This is a major takedown, pal,
and you are a crucial part of it.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.113
So I need you to go down the stairs,
out the door,

05:33.166 --> 05:34.827
one block west,
three buildings north.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.081
Okay.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.665
Uh... what am I doing?

05:39.714 --> 05:42.251
I'll take a large black.
Jerry's a double-double with sweetener.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.712
- Oliver?
- Yeah, no-fat chai latte.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.670
(man) We're looking for a silver SUV

05:48.723 --> 05:51.135
being driven by the target--
Valenz Beljac,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.561
caucasian,
5'10", 41 years of age.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.764
- (mouth full) What are you doing?
- I need to pee.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.683
| forgot. I was all psyched
to be gearing up for surveillance.

06:00.735 --> 06:04.193
And how stupid are we?
"Who wants to be in the bucket?"

06:04.239 --> 06:05.945
we actually put up our hands.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.697
Are you kidding me?
Surveillance is awesome.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.243
We're right in the middle of the action.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.901
Should've worn a diaper.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.445
Oh. How about this?

06:13.665 --> 06:15.826
And what kind of aim do you think l have?

06:18.211 --> 06:21.169
Hey, can I leave the van
if it's a medical emergency?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.079
Not if you ever want to be cut loose.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.378
(grunts)

06:25.802 --> 06:28.384
Have you ever been
white-water rafting?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.634
You dating anyone these days?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.136
Um, nope.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.220
Nope. You?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.514
It's just that you and Swarek
seem kind of friendly.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.142
Hmm?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.359
I'm not saying he's not adorable

06:45.405 --> 06:48.522
in a sort of bossy, rough trade kind of way.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.611
Just--just be careful.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.737
Okay? That's all.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.283
I mean, he--he's your training officer,
and you're a rookie.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.247
It's kind of a no-no.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.203
It's actually a rule.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.538
Yeah, well, it doesn't need
to be, 'cause he's not my type.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.294
Oh, shut up.
He'd be anybody's type.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.251
(chuckles)
Okay. He's all yours.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.297
Look. Silver SUV. That's him.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.046
Uh, Peck here.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.475
Silver SUV heading southwest
on Green Street.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.258
Too much tint to see how many occs.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.267
(whispers) "Occupants."

07:19.481 --> 07:22.518
Okay, guys, we got eyes on Beljac.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.274
He's heading up Green Street.
Keep 'em peeled.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.112
- What'd I miss?
- Jerry's sweetener?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.365
He likes the blue kind.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.749
(man) Tango 9. We've got eyes.
SUV's approaching Fleet.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.253
(clears throat) Peck, McNally,
what are you seeing?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.880
He's heading south on Fleet Street, sir.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.168
- Epstein, Nash, he's coming at you.
- Roger that.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.758
(plastic bag crinkling)

08:08.279 --> 08:09.314
He's parking.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.363
We got him on the street.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.741
(men speaking indistinct/y)

08:16.997 --> 08:18.077
(static) You guys hearing that?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.614
(men shouting indistinct/y)

08:20.667 --> 08:22.123
(frequencies squealing)

08:22.168 --> 08:23.328
What's he saying?

08:23.378 --> 08:25.994
He, uh, he's saying
that he loves you.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.288
The level's screwed.
No, there's background noise.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.547
Some kind of argument.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.457
But who's arguing? Where?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.339
Somebody gonna do
something about that?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.221
We can't lose this wiretap.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.936
(men continue arguing indistinct/y)

08:46.985 --> 08:48.020
Who's hearing this?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.149
It's up here, sir.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.026
Where is "here," McNally?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.984
Third floor,
southwest end of the hallway.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.571
(indistinct arguing continues)

08:56.619 --> 08:58.746
The target Beljac--
he's headed for the building.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.281
Okay, this is a problem.
I'm calling Boyd.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.370
- Let me put my rocks on it.
- Wait. Are they up to it?

09:05.420 --> 09:06.705
Peck, McNally,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.666
make 'em shut up now,
whatever it takes.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.296
Okay. Follow my lead.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.292
(indistinct arguing continues)

09:14.345 --> 09:15.721
And do not shout "police!"

09:17.098 --> 09:18.258
(lowers voice) Roger that.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.891
(man) Mind your own business
and get the hell outta here!

09:21.936 --> 09:23.346
There’s no way I’m leaving you
alone with--

09:23.396 --> 09:25.933
Somebody needs to get up there and stop it.
Can you hear me?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.188
- Man, get outta here!
- Hey!

09:28.234 --> 09:30.771
Hey! Hey, hey!
Keep your voices down.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.401
There's been a complaint
about the noise.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.813
I'll give you a complaint.
This guy is out of his mind.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.026
Look what this drunk
did to my face.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.737
A drunk? You think I'm drunk?
Come on, pal!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.493
Peck, McNally, hurry up.
The target's in the building.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.206
- (man) Get off me!
- Hands, head now.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.295
(handcuffs clicking)

09:51.382 --> 09:52.371
Come on.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.417
- (man) You're not taking him?
- (Gail) Just shut up!

09:57.764 --> 09:59.174
Target's heading up the north stairs.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.596
Quiet. You're right on top of him.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.631
Shh!

10:02.185 --> 10:03.174
(lowered voice)
It's under control.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.393
(knocking)

10:15.031 --> 10:17.272
(frequency squeals, static)

10:19.786 --> 10:22.698
- We alone?
- (Jerry) And Beljac's in the apartment.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.366
Here, have a look around.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.751
Let’s see what’s in the bag.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.719
Count it.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.433
48 cases.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.942
50 rounds per case,

10:54.988 --> 10:58.105
so that’s 2,400 rounds.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.023
- There's the money shot.
- What do you think?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.776
A lot of dead cops.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.496
(Jerry) Target is leaving the apartment.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.584
I’ll see you. Happy trails.
(clears throat)

11:13.464 --> 11:14.840
And...

11:15.592 --> 11:17.457
Takedown. Takedown.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.296
(tires screech, siren wailing)

11:19.345 --> 11:22.428
Those guys are just backup.
Real SWAT's in there already--

11:22.473 --> 11:25.601
smoke bombs,
dropping through ceilings on pulleys.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.020
Nope.
They're in the next-door apartment.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.896
What? Jerry told me.

11:31.941 --> 11:35.354
(woman) Target is in custody.
Repeat: The target is in custody.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.980
(Sam laughs)

11:37.363 --> 11:38.614
(police radio chatter)

11:39.199 --> 11:40.188
Ahem.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.526
All right.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.910
(police radio chatter)

11:47.373 --> 11:48.624
Who the hell is that guy?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.039
One of Beljac's crew?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.248
He saw the SWAT guys.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.663
We're not allowed to leave the van.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.081
No one else is seeing this.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.504
- He's getting away!
- Don't--don't!

12:06.267 --> 12:07.256
This is Epstein.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.175
l have one of Beljac's crew
fleeing the scene!

12:09.229 --> 12:10.890
(police radio chatter)

12:13.608 --> 12:15.223
Police! Out of the way!

12:16.444 --> 12:19.402
(Traci) Heading south to north entrance
of Cracey Square!

12:21.991 --> 12:23.902
- (Chris) Do not move!
- (Traci) We got him.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.410
(Traci panting) We got him.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.070
Other hand.

12:29.791 --> 12:30.906
(handcuffs clicking)

12:32.377 --> 12:33.833
(Jerry) Dispatch, this is Barber.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.372
(woman) Go ahead, detective.

12:35.797 --> 12:40.211
Second suspect has been apprehended.
I need 1522 to stand by for transport.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.716
- (man) 10-4.
- Nice.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.343
Hey, you know why I punched him?
You know why?

12:44.389 --> 12:45.674
He was gonna hit her.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.929
Can you sit back, sir?

12:46.975 --> 12:48.385
He was! I swear!

12:49.143 --> 12:52.886
He walked in.
We were just talkin', havin' a coffee--

12:52.939 --> 12:54.395
(chuckles) You don't smell like coffee.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.726
Yeah, what she means is you stink,
so get your face away from the cage.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.518
And then he grabbed her
around the neck.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.730
What was I supposed to do?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.692
Look, you're gonna have all the time in the world
to tell this to ajudge, all right?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.356
They're only been married
for three years,

13:05.410 --> 13:07.947
and he hits her all the time.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.955
She comes into work--she'll complain
to anyone who's listening.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.286
- What was that for?
- I told him to sit back.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.541
You all right?

13:15.586 --> 13:16.962
Yeah.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.294
I'm sorry, okay?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.414
I'm just sayin'...

13:22.969 --> 13:24.425
You got the wrong guy.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.224
(door squeaks,
police radio chatter)

13:32.270 --> 13:35.228
(indistinct conversations)

13:39.736 --> 13:42.773
(Chris) Okay, see you later.
Did you, uh, find a bathroom yet?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.897
Nice work, detective. Congratulations.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.281
I need to talk to Officer Nash.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.194
I know. I'm sorry. I held it as long as |--

13:51.247 --> 13:52.487
What the hell were you thinking?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.830
You left the surveillance van.

13:55.877 --> 13:56.866
The guy was taking off.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.082
Your orders were to stay in the van.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.923
Traci, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna--
I'm gonna have to report this.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.546
Are you reporting Dov?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.552
Epstein was just backing you up.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.801
Oh, my God.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.466
- This is about the other night, isn't it?
- What?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.896
I told you l was training with Chris.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.599
This isn't personal, okay?

14:17.648 --> 14:20.435
Well, that's funny,
'cause it feels incredibly personal.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.229
Okay, you're gonna get a copy of the report
after the boss sees it.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.487
Jerry.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.943
Maybe he was right.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.738
Maybe we shouldn't have
left her alone with her husband.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.873
We were just there about the noise, Andy.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.285
That doesn't matter.
I mean, if she's in trouble--

14:40.338 --> 14:41.453
Yeah, well,
she could have said something.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.371
- She didn't have a chance.
- It was by the book.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.881
I know. It's just--it feels...

14:46.969 --> 14:48.379
Her husband looked creepy.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.340
So she married a creep.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.255
There's really nothing
that we can do about it.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.717
You did such an awesome job,
you go back and book him.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.510
What happened?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.519
She forgot to pee
before she got in the truck.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.941
Kind of went downhill from there.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.439
(velcro rips)

15:05.488 --> 15:06.694
Traci, hey.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.230
Please don't be nice to me.
I can't handle that right now.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.274
Okay. Just making sure
you're all right.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.988
Jerry's reporting me.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.621
Apparently, I didn't follow orders,
and I burned the surveillance van.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.578
The list goes on.
But hey, it's not personal.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.744
- So you're okay, though?
- I'm fighting. Don't worry.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.415
Your nails.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.299
I know. They're gross.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.427
The fight that Gail and I broke up
at the apartment--

15:31.472 --> 15:33.053
the husband's face was all scratched up.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.055
A man wouldn't do that, would he?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.467
Scratch? No.
Men don't scratch.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.146
Well, knock 'em dead tonight.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.727
You're in the women's locker room.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.641
Okay.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.861
Hey. Traci's gettin' her gear.
What are you still doing in uniform?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.746
That kid I arrested--
he won't cough up his name.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.290
You're not coming?
You gotta cheer for us.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.952
I gotta go through mug shots,
figure out who he is.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.666
I know the guy, okay?
He's not gonna talk.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.331
There's nothing we can offer
that's--that's gonna make him give this up.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.500
- What happened?
- Beljac showed up short.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.168
He only had 2,400 rounds on him.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.552
He still goes away, though, right?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.554
Yeah, but that doesn't keep
the rest of the bullets off the street.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.807
"Off the street"? They even have
paved roads where you're from?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.592
You get your John Doe's name yet?

16:19.645 --> 16:20.725
Working on it, sir.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.636
- Well, be finished working on it.
- Right away.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.725
(Gail) What about Fite Nite?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.026
I know. ljust want to look them up,
see if we missed anything.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.320
Missed what? You know our job
wasjust to shut them up, right?

16:28.362 --> 16:31.980
I know, but the guy we left at the apartment
had scratches all over his face.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.025
The guy we arrested didn't scratch him,
'cause men don't scratch.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.453
Maybe they have a cat.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.454
Okay. Melanie Harlowe.
Same address.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.201
And she charged her husband
with assault two years ago.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.041
Maybe she was just defending herself.
We gotta go back.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.546
No, we don't.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.332
We left her alone with him.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.632
(man shouting indistinctly)
- See? You hear that?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.767
So they scream at each other, Andy.
That's not cause.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.518
Okay, well, what then?
I mean, we knock on the door,

17:03.564 --> 17:05.976
- then he knows we're here.
- Yeah, but isn't that the point?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.812
No, because then the second we're gone,
he's gonna pick up where he left off.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.442
(man shouting, indistinct)
- You know, maybe I should

17:10.488 --> 17:11.648
just go around and check
through a window.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.484
We're the police, Andy. We can't go
looking through people's windows.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.865
(Man shouting)

17:15.910 --> 17:17.275
(Melanie screams)

17:17.495 --> 17:18.735
Let's get him.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.569
(screams)

17:20.623 --> 17:22.659
Police! Police!

17:22.708 --> 17:23.959
- Aagh! Unh!
- Come here!

17:24.001 --> 17:25.616
Up against the wall.
Hands behind your back!

17:25.670 --> 17:28.161
It's okay. That's all right. You're okay.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.670
- Melanie!
- Shut up!

17:29.715 --> 17:31.330
- (Andy) You're gonna be fine.
- (Melanie gasping)

17:31.384 --> 17:35.047
Dispatch, I need a uniform car
to transport a subject to the barn.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.176
(Andy) Okay, it's gonna be fine.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.178
(chuckles)
Oh, you think that's funny?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.552
l didn't--| didn't do anything.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.556
- Andy?
- What?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.470
You better not.
Not until they take a photograph.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.855
(whimpering)

17:47.900 --> 17:49.310
Right. Okay. Okay.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.066
(Melanie crying) Oh, my God.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.398
Here. Here.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.864
All right. It's okay.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.535
It's all right. Okay?
I came back for you.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.903
I'm gonna help you. Okay?

18:02.957 --> 18:03.992
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.906
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.076
(Melanie crying)

18:09.547 --> 18:10.912
(rock music begins)

18:10.965 --> 18:13.752
(The Dudes)
J‘ The girl police are coming over .l‘

18:14.802 --> 18:17.794
J‘ Comb your hair, pretend you're sober .l‘

18:18.055 --> 18:20.046
(excited chatter)

18:20.099 --> 18:21.555
(Oliver) Hey, Nash.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.307
You know, you have some heavy shoes to fill.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.217
Sarge here--he fought his rookie year.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.260
Certainly did. Kicked some ass.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.020
And guess what?
That's why I'm the boss.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.930
Well, she's looking good, sir.
We've been working really hard.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.396
Well, she better be.
I just bet 500 bucks on you.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.437
(crowd shouting, indistinct)

18:36.616 --> 18:38.231
- No pressure!
- It's gonna be great.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.650
We got about half an hour.
You want a soda water or something?

18:40.703 --> 18:41.783
Mr. McNally!

18:41.829 --> 18:43.990
(slurring) Traci Nash!
How's it going, huh?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.951
It looks like you're in tough.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.833
(crowd shouting,
jump rope whooshing)

18:49.879 --> 18:52.962
- Sh-she's a rookie?
- A ringer. Not even police.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.874
She's been temping at 17
for a couple of weeks.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.133
- That's a secretary?
- Ah, she's sandbaggin'.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.003
Just relax, kid. You know,
you--you look her right in the eye,

19:01.057 --> 19:03.389
eh, punches in bunches.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.049
Whatever you do, don't let her scare ya.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.387
You'll be fine. I'm bettin' on ya.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.472
Yeah, yeah, come on.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.304
Well, go easy on the scotch,
Mr. McNally. It's a long night.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.190
(crowd continues shouting)

19:13.235 --> 19:14.224
(knocks)

19:16.864 --> 19:17.853
(door buzzes, beeps)

19:17.907 --> 19:19.738
Sorry to bother you.
Uh, it's just the kid, the one we--

19:19.784 --> 19:20.944
Whoa.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.452
The one who we--
who ran from the SUV.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.454
- Mm-hmm.
- I ran his prints. Nothing.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.037
I looked through every single mug shot.
No police force has ever heard of him.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.372
I thought maybe somebody else
wanted to take a run at him.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.288
While you go to Fite Nite? Nice try.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.706
How you making out with Beljac?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.169
Shut up.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.382
You know what? Go get the kid.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.716
Go get him?

19:43.766 --> 19:45.631
Yeah, bring him here.
He doesn't want to tell you who he is,

19:45.685 --> 19:46.845
let's stick him in with his boss.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.259
You want to throw him in there?

19:48.312 --> 19:50.894
What? No, you put him in there.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.771
We're going for coffee.
(door beeps)

19:55.277 --> 19:58.360
(man) This is 1513.
We're headed back to the barn.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.317
(woman) 10-4.
Have fun at Fite Nite.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.446
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?

20:01.492 --> 20:03.323
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.776
He's behind bars, right?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.865
Yeah, he's about to be.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.622
Good riddance.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.999
(chuckles)

20:13.045 --> 20:17.539
Ow. The look on his face
when you guys came through that door--

20:17.591 --> 20:19.752
he didn't know what hit him.
(both laugh)

20:19.802 --> 20:22.214
You know what he does
the morning after?

20:22.972 --> 20:24.462
He makes me coffee,

20:24.515 --> 20:26.927
and he sprinkles cinnamon on top of it.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.509
A couple years ago, I reported him.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.223
He got locked up.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.396
Got up the next morning,
and I made my own coffee.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.860
That afternoon, he was--he was out.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.984
They let him out.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.438
Hey, it's gonna be different this time.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.607
You know, all that they made him do
is sign something,

20:44.660 --> 20:47.402
and then he was back.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.703
Oh, God.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.208
Um, you know what?
Can you just drop me off?

20:54.253 --> 20:58.121
Uh, uh, just pull over here and let me out.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.706
It really wasn't that bad,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.922
and I should have known better
inviting Bruce over for a drink.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.756
l-l knew that Dan would get mad.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.842
No. The guy almost broke your nose.
You didn't ask for that.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.510
No. You're right. I didn't.
(laughs nervously)

21:11.562 --> 21:14.395
Look, you're safe tonight.
I promise.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.015
All right?
It's gonna be different this time.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.271
Okay.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.686
(sighs) Okay. Okay.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.730
Um, do you mind if I, uh,
roll down the window?

21:23.783 --> 21:26.820
Yeah, yeah.
(whirs)

21:26.869 --> 21:27.904
(exhales deeply)

21:34.543 --> 21:37.080
You gotta forget about everybody
who's out there, okay?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.211
The chief, Boyko,
all the detectives--

21:39.256 --> 21:41.417
it doesn't matter, all right?
You gotta stay focused.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.332
Keep it internalized.
Keep it in here.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.921
That's your psych-up talk?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.961
No, this is my psych-up talk.
I think we should forfeit.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.255
I'm serious.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.131
You haven't fought in five years,
and she's a ringer.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.809
Nash!

21:55.439 --> 21:58.146
Don't hit below the belt.
Don't hit behind the neck.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.648
Give me a clean fight.
Good luck.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.149
No problem.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.685
You sure?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.484
I got this... champ.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.659
Hey. Just got Melanie's statement.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.615
He was on her the second we left.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.123
- Well, it's a good thing that we went back.
- Yeah.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.159
And I considered leaving him
in his cell with his belt,

22:18.212 --> 22:21.830
'cause I really wouldn't mind
seeing the bastard string himself up.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.085
(laughs) Anyway, I didn't.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.875
(Noelle) We got a little problem.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.919
Judge says we can't hold
the husband until the trial.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.425
Seems he has the right to work
to support himself.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.055
So we have to let him out?

22:32.101 --> 22:34.513
- Two hours.
- Two hours?

22:37.439 --> 22:38.428
What do we do?

22:39.692 --> 22:42.900
(sighs) We gotta find her
someplace safe.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.196
You picked a good one--
cop killers.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.322
How do you think that makes
people around here feel?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.157
Do what you want to me.
I'm not saying anything.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.205
If you're so tough, how come
you've never been arrested before?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.119
Okay, here's the deal.
You're ruining my night.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.041
This event's about to start--

23:03.090 --> 23:04.125
free scotch,

23:04.174 --> 23:05.960
hot, sweaty chicks
banging into each other.

23:06.010 --> 23:09.218
Thing is, I don't get to go
till I figure out who you are.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.130
So why don't you just tell me
as a personal favor?

23:14.852 --> 23:15.841
Please?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.059
(door beeps)

23:22.735 --> 23:23.975
I told you, I'm not saying anything.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.893
(door closes)

23:25.946 --> 23:28.562
(speaks foreign language)

23:29.742 --> 23:30.948
Where did he come from?
(handcuffs clicking)

23:31.577 --> 23:34.489
Caught him fleeing the scene
with an illegal weapon.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.327
Sit down.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.706
You carry a gun,
you're gonna get yourself in trouble.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.495
This from the man selling illegal bullets.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.708
How old are you?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.548
- 24.
- 24?

23:51.597 --> 23:53.337
Your parents were cops? Is that it?

23:53.390 --> 23:55.221
You wanted to be just like them?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.258
No, actually, my parents were hippies.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.552
They hated cops--about the only thing
they ever agreed on.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.561
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.939
So you went against your family's wishes.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.768
Why was that?

24:07.821 --> 24:09.436
Always knew I wanted to be a cop.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.280
So you could catch bad guys like me?

24:13.327 --> 24:14.362
Maybe.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.744
Maybe itjust seemed like
a way to help people out.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.155
You want to help people out?

24:20.542 --> 24:21.702
Take a look at this kid.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.494
This kid could be anything in the world.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.212
He could be you...

24:28.300 --> 24:30.757
if he would just get his head
screwed on straight.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.471
You want to carry a weapon so badly,
why not be like him?

24:41.105 --> 24:42.311
(sniffles)

24:42.731 --> 24:43.846
Aamin, look at me.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.014
(sniffles)
Don't tell me what to do.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.477
Look at me.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.945
(sniffles) I can do the time.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.870
I know you can...

25:01.208 --> 25:02.709
but I don't want you to.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.747
All right, you want to help people?

25:11.552 --> 25:13.713
Really want to help people?
Why not start with him?

25:15.723 --> 25:16.712
How?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.050
Get out your notebook.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.688
(door buzzes, beeps)

25:38.203 --> 25:40.819
Oh, uh, can I talk to you for a second?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.989
Seriously? (chuckles) Look...

25:43.584 --> 25:45.620
I'm tired,
I drank way too much coffee,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.330
and I'm missing Fite Nite,
which I have never done before,

25:47.379 --> 25:48.414
So this better be good.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.955
Uh, it's about the kid, the one from the SUV
that I threw in interview.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.339
I got his name.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.551
You got his name? You got his real name?
That's amazing.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.588
We've been talking to a fence post in there,
pumping quarters into him for hours.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.221
We got nothing.
But you tell me you got a name?

26:00.267 --> 26:01.848
- Let's go to Fite Nite, dude!
- Beljac.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.600
I know his name!

26:04.646 --> 26:06.602
Aamin Beljac.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.900
He's your guy's little brother.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.361
(door beeps open, then closes)

26:14.406 --> 26:17.523
You know, I don't even have
a toothbrush.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.532
It's okay. It's a shelter.
They have everything here.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.114
And they know how to protect you.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.700
Yeah, and it's a bunch of strangers.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.285
(Andy) Well, try to look at that as a good thing.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.541
I mean, no matter what happens,
at least Dan doesn't know where you are.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.122
Well, you're gonna keep him
locked up, right?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.581
Yeah, as long as we can.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.919
Good. Good.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.842
He has a right to be jealous of Bruce.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.638
(sighs) It wasn't just coffee.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.265
Bruce and I had a thing
a couple months back.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.391
Dan doesn't even know.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.019
It doesn't matter.
He's still not allowed to hit you.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.688
I can't believe this is me, my life.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.853
I'm gonna sleep here tonight.
(sniffles)

26:55.906 --> 26:57.362
(velcro rips)
Here.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.984
Listen, call me on my cell
anytime, okay?

27:01.036 --> 27:03.277
And no matter what happens tonight,
you're safe here.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.367
Okay.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.871
So what now?

27:14.925 --> 27:16.085
I thought you wanted to go to Fite Nite.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.547
- I do.
- Well, then let's go to Fite Nite.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.602
Ah! Serve, protect.
You knock this chick back to 17! Yeah!

27:28.647 --> 27:29.807
(Chris) Is that the chief?

27:30.816 --> 27:32.431
(Boyko) Hey, Nash, get over here.

27:32.484 --> 27:36.102
Richard, this is Officer Nash,
one of, uh, 15's finest.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.441
So I hear.
Good luck out there.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.314
15 needs a win, Nash.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.777
Well, I'll do my best, sir.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.951
All right, come on.
You're quick. You're fast,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.453
and you'rejust as smart
as this chump.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.487
- All right?
- Yeah.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.953
Let's do this thing, all right?
Okay, okay.

27:50.002 --> 27:50.991
Let's go!

27:52.254 --> 27:55.041
(crowd cheering and whistling)

27:56.049 --> 27:57.914
(round bell rings)

28:01.680 --> 28:05.468
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fourth bout of the evening.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.304
In the blue corner,
from 17 division,

28:08.353 --> 28:10.969
weighing in at 134 pounds--

28:11.023 --> 28:14.686
Morgan "the Strapper" Stanwell!

28:15.068 --> 28:16.683
And in the red corner,

28:16.737 --> 28:18.819
the pride of 15,

28:18.864 --> 28:21.321
weighing in at 131 pounds--

28:21.366 --> 28:24.324
Traci "Boom-Boom" Nash!

28:24.369 --> 28:25.870
Nash!

28:26.288 --> 28:28.995
Ladies, let's dance!

28:29.041 --> 28:31.578
(soundtrack rock music,
cheers and applause from crowd)

28:34.546 --> 28:35.877
(round bell rings)

28:43.931 --> 28:46.673
Come on! Push her off!
Push her off!

28:51.230 --> 28:52.265
(grunting)

28:53.899 --> 28:55.480
Good job! Traci!

29:01.782 --> 29:04.569
.l‘ Is it ever gonna be enough, boy? .l‘

29:04.618 --> 29:06.449
.l‘ Is it ever gonna be enough? .l‘

29:07.412 --> 29:09.323
.l‘ Is it ever gonna be enough? .l‘

29:09.665 --> 29:10.700
Come on, Traci!

29:12.376 --> 29:15.163
.l‘ Is it ever gonna be enough, boy? .l‘

29:15.212 --> 29:18.204
.l‘ Is it ever gonna be enough? .l‘

29:18.257 --> 29:21.499
(crowd, mixed groans and cheers)

29:21.551 --> 29:23.087
Come on.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.761
2... 3...4...

29:26.807 --> 29:29.093
(Boyko) Come on, get up! Up, up, up!

29:32.104 --> 29:34.265
J‘ In the shadow .l‘

29:34.314 --> 29:36.555
J‘ There you are .l‘

29:36.608 --> 29:38.940
Come on, Traci! Shake it off!

29:45.284 --> 29:48.071
Yeah! Come on!

29:48.120 --> 29:50.031
(crowd groans)

29:50.080 --> 29:52.321
Ooh. She's getting killed.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.535
- Gail.
- What?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.207
(gasping)

29:58.714 --> 30:00.079
(round bell rings)

30:00.132 --> 30:02.839
Well, I mean,
at least she's back up on her feet.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.794
You say the word,
and I'll throw a towel in, okay?

30:06.847 --> 30:08.132
You don't have to do this.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.638
You kidding?
This is the good part.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.882
Hey.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:13.395 --> 30:14.851
You look... great.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.148
Thanks. (chuckles)

30:17.190 --> 30:18.771
Why am I doing this again?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.684
l have no idea, but since we're here,
you might as well win.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.318
Come on, Trace!

30:23.363 --> 30:25.775
Pretend that she called you a slut
or something.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.189
(Traci laughs)

30:27.701 --> 30:28.690
(ding-ding)

30:28.785 --> 30:30.321
(soundtrack rock music)

30:31.872 --> 30:34.614
(cheers and applause)

30:34.666 --> 30:35.997
Whoo!

30:38.545 --> 30:39.580
Unh!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.678
Come on! You got her!

31:00.901 --> 31:01.890
Come on! Stay up!

31:04.029 --> 31:05.360
You got her. You got her.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.987
(crowd cheering)

31:15.040 --> 31:16.871
In your corner!

31:16.917 --> 31:18.657
You okay?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.543
Look at me. Are you okay?
Are you okay?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.506
(bell ringing)

31:26.551 --> 31:28.087
Aah!

31:28.136 --> 31:30.218
(crowd cheering and whistling)

31:30.263 --> 31:32.515
(Traci laughs)
- Yeah!

31:32.557 --> 31:33.546
Yeah!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.467
(crowd cheering)

31:37.479 --> 31:39.845
Hey! Congratulations!

31:39.898 --> 31:41.854
I hope I do as well as she did.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.357
- You're fighting?
- No.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.519
I kind of wish I was,
'cause you would've thought that was cool.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.902
- A little bit.
- Mm.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.813
- Let me buy you a drink.
- It's open bar.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.151
Well, then buy me a drink.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.237
Wow, what a gentleman. (chuckles)

31:55.038 --> 31:57.825
Uh, yeah, you know, I'm, um...
Rain check?

31:57.874 --> 32:00.866
Yeah, you know what?
Uh, I might be at the Black Penny later.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.250
They're keeping it open late, so...

32:02.295 --> 32:03.501
- (Andy) Okay.
- (Andy's dad) Don't touch me.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.538
Look, all right, get your hands off me.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.750
Get your hands off me!

32:07.759 --> 32:09.465
(crash, fighting grunts)

32:09.761 --> 32:11.046
Unh! Ow!

32:11.304 --> 32:14.011
Dad, what are you doing? Stop!

32:14.057 --> 32:15.638
- Let go!
- Stop it!

32:15.684 --> 32:17.174
- Okay. Let me alone!
- What are you doing?

32:17.227 --> 32:18.433
Don't touch me!

32:23.859 --> 32:25.599
You said you weren't gonna drink.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.485
| only had a couple.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.610
You promised me.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.232
Well, maybe I shouldn't have.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.492
Yeah, well, maybe you
shouldn't have gotten drunk.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.243
Maybe you shouldn't have hit that guy.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.655
You know how hard it is for me
to be back here?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.740
Know what that guy said to me?

32:41.793 --> 32:42.908
I don't care what he said to you.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.452
I really don't care. All right?

32:48.884 --> 32:50.465
l have to work with these people.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.755
You're embarrassed of me.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.045
(sighs) Dad, that's not what I meant.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.181
Yeah, but you are.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.098
I'm sorry.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.308
I'm sorry, okay? I...

33:05.567 --> 33:06.647
It's fine.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.437
Okay?

33:14.284 --> 33:17.697
(ring announcer) ...the man with the brand...
from 24 Division, Brad "The Killer" Carr!

33:20.332 --> 33:22.038
- All right, drinks are on me, buddy.
- Yeah, they're free.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.369
- Only time they're gonna be on him.
(Dov laughs)

33:24.419 --> 33:25.955
- Hey-hey-hey!
- (Chris) Hello.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.505
- There she is.
- Hey.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.004
- Ooh. Are you, uh, you all right?
- Never better.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.836
Missed a great fight, man.
She kicked ass.

33:31.885 --> 33:32.965
Yeah? Congratulations.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.467
What happened with the bullets?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.378
Uh, we got 'em all.
But forget about that.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.841
How was the fight?
Tell me about the fight!

33:37.891 --> 33:39.097
- Tell me about the bullets!
- Tell me about the fight!

33:39.142 --> 33:40.257
Tell me about the bullets!

33:40.310 --> 33:43.302
- Uh, okay, so, uh, the kid we arrested?
- Yeah?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.311
Turns out he's Beljac's little brother.
Thank you.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.268
As soon as Beljac figured out
we had him in custody,

33:47.317 --> 33:49.103
he gave up on the bullets.
Decent guy, actually.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.608
Didn't want his little brother doing hard time.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.315
- Really?
- Yeah. What?

33:52.364 --> 33:54.070
That's--that's--wow.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.402
(Dov) Huh?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.484
Guess you owe me an apology.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.695
You all right?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.489
The kid I chased...

34:04.543 --> 34:07.125
Sounds like it was a good thing
I left the surveillance van.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.998
Sounds like you wouldn't have
made your case otherwise.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.419
Traci, you still disobeyed an order.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.583
I still gotta write it up.

34:14.636 --> 34:17.093
Now, I told you it's not personal.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.256
You know, but you didn't have backup,
and the kid had a gun.

34:23.395 --> 34:27.729
Sorry for giving a damn, all right?
Sorry for caring about your safety.

34:27.774 --> 34:30.140
Caring about my safety by reporting me?

34:31.695 --> 34:34.562
Care about whatever you want.
I can look after myself.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.147
Traci, I'm sorry.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.407
I won the fight, by the way.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.784
Hey, that was a nice fight.
I mean, she came back, right?

34:44.833 --> 34:46.448
Of course she did.
Traci's got heart.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.288
Yes, but humiliation is a pretty great
motivator, don't you think?

34:49.337 --> 34:50.326
How would you know?

34:50.380 --> 34:52.462
Your godfather's the chief of police.
Who's left to impress?

34:53.341 --> 34:55.627
Oh, sorry.
Was that a secret or something?

34:55.677 --> 34:58.510
(Andy) Listen, I can't hear you.
You need to slow down, okay? Calm down!

34:58.555 --> 35:00.796
Melanie, what?
Did you answer?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.056
- What?
- No, l...

35:03.101 --> 35:05.467
(sighs in disgust)
They let him out 15 minutes ago.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.431
- Who?
- Melanie's husband.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.725
Andy, she's at a shelter.
She's fine.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.516
Yeah, but he called her, she answered,
and she told him where she is.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.150
Well, then she's an idiot.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.480
What, did you make her
answer the phone?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.896
You know, at this point,
this is really not ourjob.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.691
We enforce the law.
We don't fix screwed-up relationships.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.609
Yeah, well, I told her
that she'd be safe from him.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.449
- Well, I didn't.
- Fine.

(Gail) Thanks.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.496
Sorry about that...

36:08.541 --> 36:10.827
about Dov.

36:10.877 --> 36:14.119
Oh, God. Yeah, whatever. As if I care.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.879
Dov and Traci--they got a thing.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.712
Anybody with connections,
they think they're working the system.

36:19.761 --> 36:20.921
Oh, and you don't?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.296
I don't know.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.678
But... you work hard,

36:27.727 --> 36:30.434
you do yourjob,
you keep your head down...

36:30.480 --> 36:33.438
maybe you get noticed.
Maybe you don't.

36:33.483 --> 36:37.146
Doesn't matter.
It's not why we're here.

36:39.114 --> 36:42.481
(scoffs) 'Cause my dad--

36:42.534 --> 36:44.525
he's talking to the chief.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.114
And yes, he's my godfather.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.872
yukking it up with the head of Homicide.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.331
My brother's probably yakking with Boyko
about the good old days.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.545
You know, maybe it makes a difference.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.171
Or maybe it doesn't.
I really have no idea,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.299
'cause it's not like anybody
tells me anything anyway.

37:02.887 --> 37:03.967
You know, except...

37:06.558 --> 37:09.641
"Be a good cop," you know?
"Do us proud."

37:11.813 --> 37:13.724
- Gail.
- It really doesn't matter.

37:17.861 --> 37:18.896
You sure?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.233
Mm. No.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.913
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.745
- I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to ask.
- It's fine.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.369
- It's just that I promised this woman that--
- You shouldn't.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.913
This job, you don't promise anything.

37:39.966 --> 37:40.955
Yeah.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.714
- Melanie.
- Hey.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.136
- Hey.
- Hejust kept calling me,

37:46.181 --> 37:48.217
and I felt really stupid not answering.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.848
What? He's here?
What happened to "good riddance"?

37:50.894 --> 37:52.850
Look, he knows this is messed up, okay?

37:52.896 --> 37:56.059
He feels terrible.
We're gonna work things out.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.222
What does that even mean?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.607
What, so he's gonna make you
coffee with cinnamon tomorrow?

37:59.652 --> 38:02.940
Maybe. Or maybe I'll make it for him.
I don't know. It's none of your business!

38:06.451 --> 38:07.566
I'm sorry.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.950
I'm really sorry.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.114
Look”.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.363
he needs me.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.708
And you won't see us again.
He promised.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.335
I don't belong in there.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.211
(car door opens)
You can't do this, okay?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.997
You can't let him come in--

38:23.051 --> 38:26.543
He's never promised before, okay?
It's gonna be different.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.587
I know you don't get it,
but he's my husband.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.629
I completely get it.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.473
I gotta at least give him a chance. I...

38:32.519 --> 38:34.180
- Melanie.
- I'm sorry.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.218
Hey.

38:36.439 --> 38:37.474
- She--
- It's not up to you.

38:37.774 --> 38:38.763
- (Dan) You okay?
- Yeah.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.961
Rough night?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.166
(chuckles)

39:03.216 --> 39:05.958
Me, too.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.671
Boyko gave this to me--

39:07.720 --> 39:09.585
Congratulations after the big win.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.051
(laughs) Yeah, right.
That's pretty great.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.308
I guess. (inhales sharply) Ohh.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.968
Come on, you were badass tonight.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.521
- I mean, you know why I started boxing?
- Huh.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.683
Crappy boyfriend in high school.

39:25.154 --> 39:27.019
He used to fight. I got into it.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.864
But when I started it,
l-l would beat the hell out of someone,

39:33.162 --> 39:34.538
get angry.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.705
All those times I got called "slut,"

39:38.877 --> 39:39.992
got dumped...
(pops cork)

39:41.337 --> 39:42.372
It felt good to hit...

39:43.381 --> 39:44.666
to be hit.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.166
Must have felt really good tonight then.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.380
Yeah, but you won.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.057
It was fun.
I mean, it was fun for a while.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.718
But now itjust feels like crap.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.894
I totally get that.
Look at me and my dad.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.523
He completely humiliates me
in front of everyone tonight,

40:07.572 --> 40:10.234
and I'm the one saying sorry.
It's pathetic.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.945

date the wrong guys.
