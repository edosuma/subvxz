00:01.735 --> 00:02.869
ALL EVENTS AND CHARACTERS
PORTRAYED HEREIN ARE FICTITIOUS.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.437
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.412
What's your name?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.750
Are you okay?
What's your name?

00:16.816 --> 00:17.851
Martín.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.452
Who asked you
to come to the tracks?

00:20.020 --> 00:20.954
Tell me, please.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.425
Martín?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.866
-Where are we going?
-Shut up!

00:33.333 --> 00:34.267
I won't!

00:38.605 --> 00:40.740
I want you to shut up.
Did you hear me?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.209
If you dare speak again,
I'll shoot you in the head.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.679
Was it clear to you?
Answer me!

00:47.514 --> 00:48.715
Fuck off, bald man!

00:49.416 --> 00:50.350
Leave him alone.
He just has a big mouth.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.651
He's speaking seriously,
you know?

00:59.259 --> 01:00.460
Hello?

01:00.527 --> 01:01.694
What are you going to do?

01:01.761 --> 01:02.762
About what?

01:03.430 --> 01:04.464
About the missing kid.

01:04.531 --> 01:05.598
I told you to take care
of both of them.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.467
I'll look for him.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.669
Don't just look for him.
Find him!

01:09.736 --> 01:11.137
Do something right!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.372
I'll find him.

01:12.672 --> 01:13.740
Listen to me.

01:14.007 --> 01:17.744
Go to the lousy boarding house
where he lives and wait for him.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.579
As soon as you see him,
you let Aguirre know.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.147
He'll take care of him.
Not you.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.482
I don't want you to do anything.

01:23.683 --> 01:24.818
Put him on the phone.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.052
Who? Aguirre?

01:26.119 --> 01:27.220
Who else?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.422
You're such as asshole!

01:31.124 --> 01:32.392
He wants to talk to you.

01:33.526 --> 01:34.561
Hello?

01:34.627 --> 01:39.032
When the other kid appears,
get rid of both.

01:39.632 --> 01:40.633
Is that clear?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.368
What if he doesn't appear?

01:43.236 --> 01:47.240
We'll see.
And get rid of Rivero too.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.909
He is so dumb
he's become dangerous.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.346
Damn you, boy!

01:58.785 --> 01:59.719
Open the trunk!

02:11.197 --> 02:12.132
There!

02:25.445 --> 02:26.379
Vero!

02:26.946 --> 02:28.615
Lucio!

02:29.849 --> 02:31.151
Hey, Lucio!

02:36.022 --> 02:37.390
Don't, Lucio!

02:41.561 --> 02:43.029
Those bastards!

03:52.498 --> 03:55.568
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

04:04.477 --> 04:05.445
What's the time?

04:05.812 --> 04:08.248
It's six o'clock.
Take this.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.816
-What is this?
-It's a painkiller.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.118
I don't need that!
We have to find the kids, Fede.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.254
Where shall we go?
No idea where they could be.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.588
Let's go to the boarding house.

04:15.855 --> 04:16.889
That is too far away.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.524
Let's go there.
He could've returned.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.026
Dientes may have decided
to come back there.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.561
All right.
Let's do that.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.898
It was my fault.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.300
Don't say that.
It was not.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.571
I shouldn't have listened
to the kids.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.508
-It is not your fault.
-It is.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.746
-Lucio got killed.
-It is not your fault.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.982
Those bastards always
have it their way.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.884
It was impossible to predict.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.887
We could've never imagined
Lucio would drive that train.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.324
Maybe.
But he did.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.360
He drove that train.

06:14.674 --> 06:15.608
Hello?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.680
The boy seems
to have calmed down.

06:21.681 --> 06:22.615
Right.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.886
He isn't coming back.
Where the hell can he be?

06:27.954 --> 06:29.655
Why do we worry so much
about that kid?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.159
Who is he going to talk to?

06:34.093 --> 06:35.628
Who will listen to him?
Not even his mother does.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.933
What did he say to you?
What's next?

06:41.467 --> 06:42.535
He didn't say anything.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.273
We can't keep doing it here.
It's impossible.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.809
We must go to other provinces.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.180
If it's not trains,
it can be fist fights.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.048
With kids.
How do you like it?

07:01.721 --> 07:03.055
-What did he say to you?
-Who?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.391
When I put you on the phone,
he spoke about me.

07:05.725 --> 07:09.228
He said nothing.
Stop it. Keep quiet.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.032
If I don't speak,
I'll fall asleep.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.602
Do it then!
Just stop bothering me.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.194
It's round the corner.
Park over there.

07:41.594 --> 07:42.628
I'll check
whether Dientes has arrived.

07:42.695 --> 07:43.896
If he is not there,
I'll give you a call.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.110
What's wrong?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.746
The gray car.
They are waiting for him.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.184
Damn!
What do we do now?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.419
Hello, Dientes.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.987
Hello, I'm Peque.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.423
Dientes called me.
He told me where he is.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.992
He is scared.
He wants you to pick him up.

08:13.459 --> 08:14.961
He saw how a guy was killed.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.730
Wait. I don't understand.
When did he call you?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.098
A few minutes ago.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.433
Where are you?

08:20.833 --> 08:21.968
At home.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.769
Is your mother there?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.438
Yes, but she's about
to leave for work.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
Are there any back doors?

08:30.977 --> 08:32.011
No, just the front door.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.748
Can't you leave
through the terrace or a window?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.250
Yes, the terrace.
Why?

08:48.728 --> 08:51.864
-Long time no see!
-That's right.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.333
-How are you?
-Worried.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.003
-Anything to drink?
-No.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.438
Let's go straight to the point.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.208
I want you
to forget about my daughter.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.279
It's too late for that.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.248
Besides, she doesn't seem
to forget about me.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.418
You owe me.
And you know it.

09:12.485 --> 09:16.188
Yes, that's why I haven't
laid a finger on her.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.024
But she leaves me no choice.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.692
If you haven't done it,
it wasn't because of me.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.761
You're free to believe
whatever what you want.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.131
I needed you in the past
and I may need you again.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.401
I'm kind to those
who are kind to me.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.973
Verónica is a reporter.
She's just doing her job.

09:34.874 --> 09:38.844
If you want her to stop,
you must offer her something.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.615
I already did.
She turned it down.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.117
What was it?

09:47.853 --> 09:50.690
Fine, I'll talk to her.

09:51.223 --> 09:56.929
Bear in mind that my name
mustn't appear anywhere.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.466
All right.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.037
Will you be able
to convince her?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.806
I'll do my best.

10:13.713 --> 10:17.883
-Who is that?
-Peque's mother.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.685
That bastard lied to me.

10:48.914 --> 10:49.849
There he is.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.126
-How are you?
-Fine.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.394
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

11:01.961 --> 11:06.298
I saw when the bald man
shot a man.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.767
He fell down and died.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.602
I ran away.
I didn't know what to do.

11:12.038 --> 11:15.508
Please, forgive me.

11:18.944 --> 11:19.979
Let's go.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.113
-Where shall we go, Fede?
-To my place.

11:21.647 --> 11:22.982
Wouldn't it be more convenient
to check into a hotel?

11:23.249 --> 11:24.283
We can't do that.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.985
They have no ID,
they are minors.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.054
-What are you planning to do?
-Drop me off at a cab stand.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.690
I'll meet you and the boys
at your place in an hour.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.291
Where are you going?

11:32.358 --> 11:33.693
I'll be at your place
in an hour.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.294
Put your seat belts on, please.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.119
Five minutes.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.871
I'm sorry.
I was told his wife is here.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.265
-Are you Mariana Valrossa?
-Yes, I am.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.403
We'll proceed to identify
your husband's body.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.472
Let me know when you're ready.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.892
Follow me, please.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.307
Vero?

15:45.544 --> 15:46.845
Vero?

15:54.253 --> 15:56.989
-What's the time?
-It's four o'clock.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.860
-Is it on the news?
-Yes, they've mentioned it.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.429
They haven't given
too many details though.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.732
"Confusing episode resulting
in train driver's death."

16:07.099 --> 16:09.201
There is a lot of speculation.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.337
Nobody talked
about the competitions?

16:11.704 --> 16:15.607
No, not even
Lucio's co-workers.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.411
-Were they interviewed?
-Some of them were.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.214
They all said he looked upset.
Just that.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.487
-What about the boys?
-Come with me.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.576
-Your father called.
-Really?

16:51.043 --> 16:53.045
-Yes, half an hour ago.
-What happened?

16:53.412 --> 16:55.447
-He wants to talk to you.
-Why?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.183
-He knows about it.
-About what?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.119
He knows everything.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.522
-What exactly?
-Everything.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.209
-Laura told me you were here.
-I was waiting for you.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.448
I thought you'd quit.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.917
It's the first one I smoke
since your mother died.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.140
-We need to work this out, Vero.
-Of course.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.776
We must put all these bastards
in jail.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.246
-That's impossible, you know.
-Why?

18:02.448 --> 18:04.083
Do you know what this is?

18:06.952 --> 18:08.754
The money laundering case
García got away with.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.122
Thanks to you.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.992
They hire me for that.
To defend people.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.494
You defend criminals.

18:15.861 --> 18:18.464
I defend people.
That's my job.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.032
I must do it well.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.234
I'm a reporter.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.669
My job is
to provide information.

18:23.735 --> 18:24.903
I must do it well too.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.573
In order to do that,
you need evidence.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.475
I'll get the evidence.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.944
You haven't published
anything so far.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.347
That means you have nothing.
I know you.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.283
I know you need evidence.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.086
Something to give
to your publishing house.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.521
What did you want
to see me about?

18:42.821 --> 18:44.022
I talked to García.

18:45.591 --> 18:48.827
He said he offered you a deal.
Is that true?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.369
When did you talk to him?

18:57.803 --> 18:58.937
Never mind.

19:00.172 --> 19:05.043
When these guys offer a deal,
it's about people.

19:05.544 --> 19:06.545
You'll be able
to finish your article.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.417
-It's not enough for me, dad.
-It should be.

19:13.519 --> 19:16.522
He also told me
that if you accept the deal,

19:16.588 --> 19:17.723
the competitions will be over.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.193
They are dangerous guys.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.896
If nothing has happened
to you so far,

19:23.962 --> 19:25.264
it's because
you're useful to him.

19:25.697 --> 19:28.567
You are the one
who'll make him come out clean.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.403
You should be happy about that.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.072
No more dead kids.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.308
That'd be the end
of that cruel game.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.111
Think about it.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.417
Go to hell!

19:48.220 --> 19:50.789
Verónica?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.663
What happened?

19:59.865 --> 20:02.467
-Have you talked to your father?
-I'll meet with García.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.239
What did your father say?

20:07.606 --> 20:09.441
-He wants me to accept the deal.
-So?

20:14.246 --> 20:16.748
Who is God?
Tell me, Vero.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.750
Hello?
I'd like to meet you.

20:20.586 --> 20:21.753
Yes. Where?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.591
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.727
Tell me what you've done.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.363
I'm talking to you, Vero.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.263
Give me your cell phone.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.335
I'll search you.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.076
Come in.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.180
-Just her.
-No, me too.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.317
Stay put.
Just her.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.128
Have you talked to your father?

22:13.231 --> 22:14.700
He told me to accept the deal.

22:17.135 --> 22:18.537
He's a bright man.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.473
-What about the competitions?
-They'll be over.

22:22.741 --> 22:25.210
When things get so complicated,
it's worthless to continue.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.913
We'll move on to something else.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.651
Something else?
What would that be?

22:35.587 --> 22:38.690
There'll be no kids involved.
Is that enough for you?

22:42.527 --> 22:43.995
I also want the guy
in the gray car.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.035
I don't like
to be pushed around.

22:51.636 --> 22:52.838
It's up to you.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.941
If you want us to have a deal,
I want that guy,

22:56.007 --> 22:57.342
apart from Palma and Rivero.

23:08.820 --> 23:09.988
Fine.

23:11.690 --> 23:12.724
I also want the other kid...

23:12.791 --> 23:13.792
who was in the competition
last night.

23:14.793 --> 23:18.730
Martín.
Where is he?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.703
If you did something to him,
the deal is off.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.676
The boy is fine.
But I don't know if he wants to.

23:32.711 --> 23:33.979
If he wants to do what?

23:34.846 --> 23:37.282
To come back
to his old shitty life.

23:37.616 --> 23:38.717
Let me ask him.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.724
What shall I do next?

23:48.260 --> 23:52.097
Turn around and go back
the way you came.

24:00.272 --> 24:05.544
Hey, don't forget this.

24:24.062 --> 24:27.332
-Come on!
-Wait! I'm not properly seated.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.868
Are you ready?
It's just a piece of cardboard.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.470
All right. Now!

24:41.379 --> 24:42.347
I thought you were braver.

24:45.851 --> 24:46.885
Hi, guys.

24:47.385 --> 24:49.721
-Can I use your computer?
-Of course.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.791
There is a tablet upstairs.
Can we use it?

24:59.297 --> 25:00.765
You can have lunch upstairs.
Just for today.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.235
Take the cardboard away.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.696
I've printed some screenshots.

26:06.831 --> 26:08.700
These are Rivero and Aguirre.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.003
That is Palma
signing some checks.

26:12.537 --> 26:13.572
And here is Amante.

26:14.205 --> 26:16.808
How old are those girls?
Fifteen? Sixteen?

26:16.875 --> 26:18.977
At the most.
No doubt they are minors.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.913
There is something else.
Take a look at this one.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.216
-Who is that?
-A district attorney.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.887
-I can't believe it.
-He is. I swear it.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.922
I can't remember his name.

26:30.989 --> 26:35.060
But he works
for the local government.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.661
All the more reason
to find the license plates.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.229
That will take us
to the gamblers.

26:38.296 --> 26:39.764
There must be a hundred guys
like that D.A.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.466
It's kind of blurred.

26:41.733 --> 26:45.136
But maybe a technician
can improve the image.

26:49.975 --> 26:51.142
What is it?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.851
I can't stop thinking
about García.

26:59.918 --> 27:00.885
He'll get away with it.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.421
And I've helped him.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.225
I kept complaining
about my father...

27:07.292 --> 27:08.326
but I ended up doing the same.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.866
It is not the same.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.684
I can't believe it, Vero.
You gave everyone away.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.419
Do you have evidence?

27:35.086 --> 27:36.454
Of course.
Fede has everything.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.259
He is going to hand it over
to a D.A. he knows...

27:41.326 --> 27:42.894
a few hours
before the story comes out.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.597
Neither a long time before
nor a long time afterwards.

27:45.864 --> 27:49.100
Because as soon as these guys
see this, they'll run away.

27:50.301 --> 27:53.738
There must be something
about all this on TV.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.175
I don't want to see it.
Let's watch a movie.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.577
A movie?

28:02.113 --> 28:04.182
-This one again?
-Again.

28:04.449 --> 28:05.617
Do we have to?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.054
All right, as you wish.

28:33.745 --> 28:35.814
We need to talk.
Federico.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.286
I'm impressed, Vero.
Congratulations.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.657
Vilna is very excited.

28:45.924 --> 28:47.992
He wants to know if you have
another story on your mind.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.895
As if it was so easy!

28:53.565 --> 28:54.766
I have to leave, Pato.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.517
Hello, Vero.
Come in, please.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.419
-How are you?
-What's up, Fede?

29:15.186 --> 29:17.322
Some good news.
They've made some raids.

29:19.324 --> 29:20.558
Let me take your coat.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.495
Amante and Palma
are already in jail.

29:23.561 --> 29:24.662
I know that.

29:24.729 --> 29:27.999
But Rivero and Aguirre,
who killed Lucio, are not.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.400
-Something came up.
-What?

29:29.834 --> 29:33.271
We've got the video.
Rafael made a statement.

29:33.538 --> 29:35.840
It's not that.
Listen to me, please.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.779
Rivero used to live in the club.
He had a room there.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.082
They found Aguirre in that room.
He was dead.

29:44.916 --> 29:45.884
What?

29:46.885 --> 29:50.121
Here are the pictures.
Apparently, there was a fight.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.657
They suppose Aguirre
was planning to kill Rivero.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.992
Rivero learned about it
and killed him first.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.060
How did he kill him?

29:56.327 --> 29:58.496
He hit in on the head
and then he shot him twice.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.866
-Where is Rivero now?
-Nobody knows.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.535
He is a fugitive.
He is armed.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.436
Nobody knows where the hell
he can be.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.439
-Maybe he returned to La Pampa.
-Could be.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.108
But an arrest warrant
has been issued.

30:10.175 --> 30:11.743
So sooner or later
he will be found.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.045
We need him now!

30:14.112 --> 30:17.348
I don't care a thing
about Palma or Amante.

30:17.615 --> 30:19.584
Rivero is the second worst,
after García.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.685
I know.

30:20.752 --> 30:21.920
He was the one
who recruited the boys.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.154
I can see that.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.157
What about the license plates?

30:26.424 --> 30:28.893
Who are the bastards
who bet on the boys' lives?

30:28.960 --> 30:32.063
The judge is taking care of it.
I don't know...

30:32.130 --> 30:33.364
What is it that you don't know?

30:33.431 --> 30:36.568
You know what I mean.
This case is a Pandora's box.

30:36.634 --> 30:38.269
You look here and something
appears somewhere else.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.004
Let it be opened!

30:42.240 --> 30:44.108
What about the D.A.
who was betting?

30:44.175 --> 30:47.445
-Actually, he is not betting.
-It's on the video, Fede.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.881
But he is not betting
right on the site.

30:49.948 --> 30:52.884
He told the judge
he had been cheated.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.786
He had no idea
what he was doing there.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.488
-Are you kidding me?
-Not at all.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.324
Why didn't he make a claim then?

30:59.390 --> 31:01.492
The judge asked him the same.
Do you know what he answered?

31:01.559 --> 31:03.027
He was about to make a claim.

31:05.463 --> 31:07.332
-I can't believe it.
-Me neither.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.439
If the judge doesn't do
anything, I will.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.808
I'll catch all those bastards.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.977
I have a copy of the video.
I'll hire a hacker.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.346
I'll pay him 1000 dollars
for each license plate.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.048
Or maybe 2,000.
Even 10 000. Whatever.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.216
I'll sell my apartment,
if necessary.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.118
I'll catch those bastards.
And García too.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.353
Calm down, Vero.
Don't be so naïve.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.021
How could you possibly do that?

31:30.088 --> 31:31.789
If we catch the gamblers,
they may give him away.

31:32.056 --> 31:36.027
They don't even know his face.
Forget about that, Verónica.

31:36.094 --> 31:38.029
Stop telling me to forget, Fede.

31:39.097 --> 31:41.666
I can't forget.
I just can't.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.204
Damn you, girl!
Open the door!

36:38.196 --> 36:39.864
Thanks.
I'll be right over.

36:41.232 --> 36:44.468
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.074
I'll go to the police station
to make sure...

36:50.141 --> 36:51.342
they apply the right procedure.

36:52.743 --> 36:53.811
Would you rather
I stayed here with you?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.246
No, go ahead.

36:58.649 --> 37:00.117
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

37:02.286 --> 37:03.321
Fine.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.389
Take care.

38:07.318 --> 38:08.586
Very well.

38:09.987 --> 38:13.090
Next week you can start
physiotherapy.

38:13.824 --> 38:17.461
You'll be able to walk again
in about a month.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.631
Fine.
What about the cuffs?

38:20.931 --> 38:23.234
-No idea. Good bye.
-What do you mean?

38:25.603 --> 38:26.704
Hey, you!

38:31.442 --> 38:32.777
Damn!

38:38.282 --> 38:40.985
This is for you.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.121
And this is for you.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.261
Any news?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.196
A lot of nervous people.

38:52.763 --> 38:56.734
They are afraid to be called
to testify.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.671
Send the boys to calm them down.

39:00.738 --> 39:01.672
What about "Three"?

39:02.306 --> 39:04.775
He will be sent
to Sierra Chica or Olmos.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.179
Any relatives?

39:08.245 --> 39:10.881
Yes, his mother and two aunts.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.084
Make sure they have
everything they need.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.622
-What about the boy?
-A promising career.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.794
Take him too.
So he gets used to it.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.296
All right.

40:02.032 --> 40:02.967
Easy!

40:15.212 --> 40:16.914
-Hello.
-Hi.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.884
-Can Peque come with us?
-Of course.

40:21.652 --> 40:24.555
-Let's go.
-Pass the ball.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.727
-Hello.
-Good bye.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.830
Andrea, this is Verónica.
Verónica, this is Andrea.

40:32.897 --> 40:35.733
-Nice to meet you.
-I'll wait for you inside.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.836
-How are you?
-Much better.

40:39.203 --> 40:40.271
What about your leg?

40:40.604 --> 40:42.640
I feel some discomfort.
But I'm not in pain.

40:44.408 --> 40:47.344
-Are you two living together?
-Kind of.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.780
She said I could stay
until I got well.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.583
She hasn't kicked me out yet.
That's why I'm still here.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.921
I heard what happened
with Rivero.

40:58.088 --> 41:02.760
You're really brave.
I wish I were like you.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.829
Why do you say that?

41:07.631 --> 41:10.935
I have to leave.
Take care.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.238
You too.
Good bye.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.008
What's with you too?

41:19.844 --> 41:21.912
-Seat belts, guys.
-I've already put it on.

41:22.813 --> 41:25.249
Great!

42:33.017 --> 42:34.184
I'm going to miss you.
