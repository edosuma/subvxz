See anything that looks like a customer?

01:10.612 --> 01:12.655
No, but there's a pigeon up here

01:12.739 --> 01:14.991
That kind of resembles my Aunt Mildred.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.120
I just don't understand what's
precipitating this downturn in business.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.915
You'd think car buyers
were a vanishing species.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.962
Ooh! A genuine Lincoln-Head
one-cent piece,

01:28.046 --> 01:30.507
all by its solitary lonesome!

01:33.134 --> 01:36.012
Find a penny, pick it up,
and all day long you'll have--

01:40.058 --> 01:41.351
Luck.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.355
Whoever decided pennies
were good luck anyways?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.607
Old Abe wasn't exactly Mr. Lucky.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.736
Ouch!

01:51.820 --> 01:54.739
Right in the lower east side
of my cranium!

01:56.574 --> 01:57.826
[screeching]

01:58.410 --> 01:59.494
Whoa!

01:59.577 --> 02:00.745
Hey! Aah!

02:00.829 --> 02:04.582
Don't go under the ladder!
It's bad-- whooooaaa!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.084
[bonk]

02:08.378 --> 02:10.797
Whew! That was close.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.466
Thought I was gonna have a problem
for a second there.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.968
Well, whaddya know?

02:15.051 --> 02:16.636
I do have a problem!

02:18.013 --> 02:19.097
If I didn't know any better

02:19.180 --> 02:21.349
I'd think I was having
a streak of bad luck!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.268
Uh, say, uh, Petey...

02:23.351 --> 02:25.854
Nahhh! Gotta be something else.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.815
I don't believe in that silly
superstitious stuff.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.942
I--what?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.694
I locked myself out?

02:32.777 --> 02:35.238
Of all the rotten luck!

02:35.321 --> 02:36.573
Wait a minute, what am I saying?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.284
I don't have a superstitious bone
in my body, knock wood.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.911
Ow!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
[Goofy] Oh, Pete!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.206
Yeah? Whaddya want?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.417
Oof!

02:47.500 --> 02:51.129
Just wanted to let you know
i was gonna fall on ya.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.759
Now, where did I put that good old
Whatever it is I'm looking for?

02:55.842 --> 02:56.885
Electric spoon...

02:56.968 --> 03:00.930
There's that sardine 'n' onion sandwich
I lost last spring.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.557
Box of corduroy underwear,

03:02.640 --> 03:03.725
lucky horseshoe...

03:03.808 --> 03:05.643
What are you trying to find, Dad?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.645
Oh, that thing that came in the mail.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.938
I put it in my pocket,

03:09.022 --> 03:11.358
and now I can't find hide nor hair of it.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.319
Uh, you mean this thing
in your back pocket?

03:14.402 --> 03:16.196
Why, that's it, Maxie!

03:16.821 --> 03:18.948
How'd ya ever think to look there?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.700
Lucky guess, I guess.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.160
Hmph!

03:23.078 --> 03:25.997
It's just a series
of coincidental accidents.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.376
Doesn't have anything to do
with luck or supersti-- ow!

03:31.961 --> 03:33.546
Not a good sign.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.635
Well, it could be happening.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.970
A guy can get a run of bad luck.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.515
Same as a woman
gets a run in her stocking.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.893
Well, maybe it's happening to...

03:47.018 --> 03:48.728
[gulp] Me!

03:51.439 --> 03:53.024
Spilt salt!

03:58.113 --> 04:00.240
Pete! Oh, Petey!

04:00.323 --> 04:02.867
What? I wasn't doing anything!

04:02.951 --> 04:04.994
I was just salting the grass

04:05.078 --> 04:06.913
for reasons of slug control.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.915
I found the entry form for the--

04:08.998 --> 04:11.167
Spoonerville 500 road rally!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.545
Yes! Ha-ha-ha!

04:13.628 --> 04:15.255
Winning this race...

04:15.338 --> 04:18.008
is gonna put Pete's car lot
on the map!

04:18.091 --> 04:21.177
Why, my name will be
on the tip of every tongue.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.805
There'll be two used Pete cars
in every garage.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.559
Yes, sir, this is gonna turn
my luck around.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.853
It's the 13th Annual Race,

04:29.936 --> 04:32.856
and it's bein' held ON Friday the 13th.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.191
Hee-hee! What?

04:57.589 --> 04:58.757
Let me see, now...

04:58.840 --> 05:00.633
Lucky rabbit's foot, complete with rabbit.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.597
Lucky four-leaf clover, roots and all.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.392
Assorted charms.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.270
And that ought to take care of me.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.993
Aww. If it wasn't for bad luck,

05:27.077 --> 05:29.746
I'd have no luck at all.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.830
[horn honks]

05:30.914 --> 05:32.332
That noxious noise

05:32.415 --> 05:37.462
can only be the horn belonging
to Earl of Earl's Auto.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.054
Hiya, chimp! Or don't I mean to say chump?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.348
What are you doing here, squirrel?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.434
Or don't I mean to say Earl?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.396
Well, I would ask to see
a cherry car in mint condition,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.356
but all you got is lemons.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.859
Save the lame stuff
for your TV commercials,

05:59.943 --> 06:01.027
and state your business!

06:01.111 --> 06:03.405
Oh, thought maybe you'd wanna make

06:03.488 --> 06:08.284
a small sideways wager on the outcome
of the Spoonerville 500.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.078
Well...

06:10.161 --> 06:12.205
matter of fact, I'm not enterin'
this year.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.875
I, uh-- I got an ingrown toenail disorder
on my pedal foot,

06:15.959 --> 06:16.835
and my liverwurst is gettin' worse.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.671
And I just can't sit in a car
for more than 10 minutes at a time.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.756
That's what I thought.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.592
You're nothing but a big yellow bellied
hot house chicken.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.345
Well, that, too, but--
what did you call me?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.347
Hey, fine,

06:29.472 --> 06:32.684
you're one less car to pass
on my way to the finish line!

06:32.767 --> 06:34.394
Listen, you turtle head,

06:34.477 --> 06:37.689
if you think I'm going
to waste my precocious time racin' you,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.566
then that's just your tough lu--

06:39.649 --> 06:41.776
[coughing]

06:41.860 --> 06:43.153
Luck!

06:48.158 --> 06:51.077
Spinach next to peas, good luck, please.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.830
Salad fork here, good luck for a year.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.332
There, that takes care of--

07:00.045 --> 07:02.297
That. What's everybody
gawking at?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.383
You'd think you never seen a guy
alphabetize his veggies.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.053
Oh, Pete, isn't it interesting that

07:08.136 --> 07:10.013
the 13th Annual Spoonerville 500

07:10.096 --> 07:13.600
is being held on Friday the 13th.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.643
Do tell.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.438
The 13th falls on the 13th this year, HUH?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.441
Oh, but you wouldn't be
the least bit superstitious,

07:21.524 --> 07:23.568
would you, shamrock lips?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.945
Ha-ha-ha!

07:26.029 --> 07:27.280
Me? Super--

07:27.364 --> 07:29.324
Fixed yer umbrelly, Petey.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.992
Works perfect now!

07:36.331 --> 07:38.541
Just be careful not to get it wet.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.424
Oh!

07:49.719 --> 07:52.055
Don't you know opening one of them
in the house is bad--

07:52.138 --> 07:53.932
Bad... taste?

07:54.015 --> 07:57.018
Why don't you admit it--
You are superstitious.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.520
Are you, Daddy?

07:58.603 --> 08:01.439
Are you really, really supersti-sti-sti--

08:01.523 --> 08:02.607
What mommy said?

08:02.691 --> 08:06.277
-You're not! Are you, Dad?
-Yeah!

08:06.361 --> 08:08.613
You're not stuper-sloopy
super...

08:08.697 --> 08:10.532
Uh, what pistol said?

08:10.615 --> 08:13.576
Of course I'm not-- I'm not...

08:13.660 --> 08:16.121
Well, what I'm saying here...

08:16.204 --> 08:18.540
I'm trying to say that I'm--I'm not...

08:24.504 --> 08:26.089
I am not superstitious!

08:26.172 --> 08:29.300
And to prove it,
I'm gonna enter that race!

08:34.681 --> 08:36.933
Aww, what've I gone

08:37.017 --> 08:38.685
and got myself into?

08:38.768 --> 08:42.147
Has your luck run out on you?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.606
Has it ever!

08:43.690 --> 08:47.944
Is bad luck following you everywhere?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.280
You could say that twice
and still not know the half of it!

08:50.363 --> 08:52.782
Do you want your luck to change?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.454
Speak up! I can't read your mind.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.373
I'm sorry, I thought you could.
Yes, yes!

09:00.457 --> 09:02.584
Then come to Madame Zelderina's

09:02.667 --> 09:06.421
fortune telling emporium and pie shop.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.339
No.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.798
Yes!

09:08.882 --> 09:09.924
Let Zelderina,

09:10.008 --> 09:13.553
psychic, seer, and master baker,

09:13.636 --> 09:15.347
remove your bad luck.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.893
Aw, a downright upstandin' citizen like me

09:19.976 --> 09:21.728
can't go to a...

09:21.811 --> 09:23.646
fortune teller!

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
Come see Zelderina...

09:26.066 --> 09:27.359
Zelderina...

09:27.442 --> 09:28.777
Zelderina.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.404
Or can I?

09:41.206 --> 09:45.168
Mr. Pete, I've been expecting you.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.045
How'd you know my name?

09:47.128 --> 09:51.049
Madame Zelderina knows all.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.218
Besides, you called for appointment.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.552
You want pie?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.892
I smell your aura miles away...

10:01.226 --> 10:02.686
like meatball sandwich.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.978
That was lunch.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.398
With spicy hot peppers?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.149
You have heartburn, no?

10:08.233 --> 10:11.486
Er, I have heartburn, yes.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.489
Madame Zelderina knows all!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.991
Come...sit.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.997
I see your bad, bad...

10:23.081 --> 10:27.210
Oh, terrible bad,
ew, yuck, awful bad luck!

10:27.293 --> 10:30.296
Oh, bad as all that, is it?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.340
No. Worse.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.050
I know answer!

10:34.134 --> 10:36.219
But I haven't even asked the question.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.930
Money is root of all evil.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.932
It drains your luck dry.

10:41.016 --> 10:44.853
Let Zelderina absorb
all of Mr. Pete's bad luck.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.022
Give me your money!

10:47.105 --> 10:49.190
You got it-- what?

10:49.274 --> 10:50.608
Yes, money. Yes!

10:50.692 --> 10:52.444
Give to Zelderina!

10:52.527 --> 10:54.237
Give your bad luck now!

11:06.624 --> 11:08.543
There. How you feel?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.128
Um...

11:10.211 --> 11:11.129
Broke?

11:11.212 --> 11:14.049
Good! Healing has begun.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.258
But what's this?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.680
To bring good luck back,

11:20.764 --> 11:22.474
Uh... uh...

11:22.557 --> 11:27.645
The baggy-panted one
who dances with rakes!

11:29.522 --> 11:32.609
The whatsy whosit does what with who?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.904
Trust Madame Zelderina.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.572
Time's up.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.449
Want some pastry to go?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.700
No, but-- but--

11:40.784 --> 11:43.286
No problem. I send bill.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.706
Good luck, and stay away
from greasy fried foods.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.541
Hey! Wait a minute!

11:48.625 --> 11:51.711
How am I ever gonna find
the baggy-panted one

11:51.795 --> 11:53.922
who dances with rakes?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.607
I almost gotcha!

12:12.691 --> 12:15.318
Ooh! Playin' hard to get, huh?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.362
C'mere, ya slippery little--

12:21.533 --> 12:22.617
It's him...

12:22.701 --> 12:27.122
The baggy-panted one
who dances with rakes.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.877
Whoa! Uh!

12:34.004 --> 12:35.422
And it's...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.590
The Goof!

12:40.719 --> 12:42.721
I want my money back now!

12:44.347 --> 12:47.600
Madame Zelderina sees Mr. Pete

12:47.684 --> 12:51.354

12:51.438 --> 12:53.648
Wh-what? Del-delusions?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.233
Spots? I do?

rake dancer.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.963
And I sure ain't puttin' him
in any race car of mine!

13:17.047 --> 13:21.343
Oh. But he is very good luck.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.469
But I can't--

You wish to be in big race, no?

13:25.096 --> 13:27.390
Uh, big race, yes.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.268
Then he must be with you at all times.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.354
He is ticket to good luck

13:32.437 --> 13:35.190

13:47.786 --> 13:51.414
You must be cleansed pure.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.921
Well, look who it is, my old pal the Goof.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.299
You know, I heard a little secret today
that you're Spoonerville's

14:01.383 --> 14:03.218
all time greatest auto mechanic.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.136
That's a secret, all righty.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
'Cause I had no idea.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.599
That why you're now on Team Pete.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.601
You're gonna be my mechanic,

14:11.685 --> 14:14.646
and help me win the Spoonerville 500.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.023
Sounds kinda mechanical.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.192
And it'll only cost you
100 bucks to be on the team.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.986
Well, uh, when you put it that way,

14:22.070 --> 14:23.613
it's a deal!

14:23.697 --> 14:26.616
And it'd be well worth it
at half the price, too.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.201
Heh-heh-heh.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.579
Looks like I got my lucky charm.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.097
What have you done to it?

14:49.180 --> 14:51.474
Now, don't thank me just yet.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.102
I gotta make it run again first.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.521
Run? Run?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.523
You better make it run!

14:58.606 --> 15:01.609
And I don't care if you have to
stay up all night to do it!

15:01.693 --> 15:04.904
[sweetly] Of course,
that is if you don't mind

15:04.988 --> 15:06.281
stayin' up all night.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.616
Oh, don't worry about a thing, Petey.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.078
By morning I'll have this baby
purring like a mouse...

15:12.162 --> 15:13.663

Mr. P!

I don't need luck, Max my boy.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.762
Racing's all a matter of skill.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.972
Why, there's your car, Peter.

15:31.056 --> 15:35.143
Oh, and look-- they made you number 13.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.644
Thirteen, huh?

15:36.728 --> 15:39.022
Only 14 more minutes, Dad.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.316
Nope, make that 13.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.111
Yep. Race starts at 1:00.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.165
No, but you don't mind, do you?

15:57.248 --> 15:59.084
Because you're not superstitious--

15:59.167 --> 16:00.168
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.378
Are you?

16:01.461 --> 16:04.214
Oh, no, no, no! Uh-uh!

16:08.218 --> 16:09.636
Pete, watch out!

16:09.719 --> 16:12.847
Ya almost stepped on that
little black kitty cat!

16:13.098 --> 16:14.265
Black cat?

16:14.349 --> 16:16.017
Wait, Goof, come back!

16:16.726 --> 16:19.396
I never thought the day would come
when I'd hear myself sayin' this,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.564
but I don't want you out of my sight
for even a second.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.108
I want you right by my side

16:23.191 --> 16:25.443
nonstop, start to finish.
You got that?

16:25.527 --> 16:26.778
Sure thing, Petey.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.491
I just wish I could have gotten
one winky-dink of sleep last night.

Of course, I didn't mean
to insult your goofability.

What I meant was, you're a gem of a goof,

18:35.949 --> 18:37.701
a prince among paupers.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.581
