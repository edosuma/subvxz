WEBVTT

00:07.075 --> 00:09.277
HONEY, THIS WAS SUCH
A GREAT IDEA--

00:09.310 --> 00:12.146
GETTING UP EARLY SO WE CAN
HAVE SOME QUIET TIME TOGETHER.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.317
- YOU'RE A JERK!
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

00:16.350 --> 00:20.454
ALL RIGHT,
TOMORROW WE GET UP JUST
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.423
OKAY, WHAT'S
GOING ON, GUYS?

00:22.456 --> 00:25.459
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
HE SNORTS LIKE A PIG.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.262
- OINK OINK OINK!
- OH YEAH? WELL, YOU SCREAM
IN YOUR SLEEP.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.064
- ( screaming )
- OINK OINK OINK!

00:30.098 --> 00:32.466
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!

00:32.500 --> 00:35.069
- WE'VE GOT TO
HAVE OUR OWN ROOMS.
- GUYS, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.471
- THE HOUSE JUST
ISN'T BIG ENOUGH.
- OR IS IT?

00:37.505 --> 00:40.408
I MADE A DIAGRAM, SEE?
NEW SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.810
MOM AND DAD GO HERE.
P.J. TAKES THIS ROOM.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.812
TEDDY TAKES THIS ONE
AND I GET THIS ONE.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.215
- EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.
- WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?

00:47.248 --> 00:49.550
OH, I FORGOT TO MENTION

00:49.583 --> 00:52.553
IN THIS PLAN...

00:52.586 --> 00:54.522
CHARLIE LIVES
WITH GRANDMA.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.858
GABE, WOULD YOU
JUST BE PATIENT?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.361
YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOUR OWN ROOM
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:00.394 --> 01:02.263
WHEN P.J.
GOES OFF TO COLL--

01:05.866 --> 01:09.303
WELL, WHEREVER IT IS
THAT P.J. GOES OFF TO.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.176
- OH HI.
- OH LOOK!

01:15.209 --> 01:17.345
THERE'S OUR
PRETTY GIRL.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.514
HEY, YOU GOT
OUT OF BED TODAY.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.251
I JUST CAME UP
TO GET MY BREAKFAST.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.154
HONEY, DON'T TAKE
THE BROWN BANANA.
GET THE YELLOW ONE.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.522
YELLOW'S TOO HAPPY
A COLOR.

01:31.192 --> 01:34.395
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S STILL MOPING ABOUT
HER BREAKUP WITH SPENCER.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.664
THAT WAS LIKE
TWO WHOLE DAYS AGO.

01:36.697 --> 01:40.268
GIVE HER A BREAK, P.J.
SPENCER WAS TEDDY'S FIRST LOVE.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.437
YEAH, I MEAN,
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
YOU GET DUMPED ALL THE TIME.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.541
- NO, I DON'T!
- OH REALLY?

01:47.575 --> 01:50.478
THIS YEAR ALONE
YOU'VE BEEN DUMPED BY ALEXA,

01:50.511 --> 01:52.546
REBECCA, JEN--

01:52.580 --> 01:54.715
JEN?
I'M DATING JEN
RIGHT NOW.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.618
OH.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.621
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THAT MESSAGE?

02:04.525 --> 02:05.893
( rock music playing )

02:05.926 --> 02:07.461
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

02:07.495 --> 02:09.263
* RUNNING LATE,

02:09.297 --> 02:11.599

02:11.632 --> 02:13.601

02:13.634 --> 02:15.603
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

02:19.207 --> 02:22.176
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

02:22.210 --> 02:25.213
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

02:25.246 --> 02:28.649
* HANG IN THERE, BABY,
THINGS ARE CRAZY *

02:28.682 --> 02:31.519
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

02:31.552 --> 02:33.554
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:33.587 --> 02:35.223
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

02:35.256 --> 02:38.192
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

02:38.226 --> 02:40.461
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:40.494 --> 02:43.697
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:43.731 --> 02:47.635
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:49.237 --> 02:51.605
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.882
( TV playing )

03:01.915 --> 03:04.485
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, WE ARE OFF.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.355
OH, I JOINED THIS GREAT NEW GYM
THAT OFFERS FREE CHILDCARE.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.323
I GET TO WORK OUT

03:09.357 --> 03:11.692
GREAT, HONEY.
THE DOUBLE GLAZED.TA TRY

03:11.725 --> 03:15.329
YOU KNOW, BOB,

03:15.363 --> 03:18.466
THAT'S REALLY GOOD
TO KNOW.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.768
WHY DID WE ONLY GET
A DOZEN OF THESE?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.570
( doorbell rings )

03:26.807 --> 03:28.576
HI, MRS. DABNEY.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:28.609 --> 03:31.779
- WHY WOULD THERE BE A PROBLEM?
- SORRY, FORCE OF HABIT.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.649
I WAS WONDERING
IF ANYONE WAS AVAILABLE

03:35.683 --> 03:37.585
TO HELP ME MOVE
SOME JUNK INTO MY GARAGE.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.787
I'LL DO IT!
FOR 15 BUCKS AN HOUR.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.689
I WAS THINKING
OF ANOTHER MEMBER

03:41.722 --> 03:44.358
OF THE DUNCAN FAMILY.
ANY OTHER MEMBER.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.594
SORRY, BUT I'M ON MY WAY
TO THE GYM.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.297
I'VE GOT A WHOLE LIST
OF CHORES I GOTTA DO.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.633
I SEE THE FIRST THING
DONUT BOX."T IS "CLEAN OUT

03:54.568 --> 03:57.638
15 AN HOUR, GOING ONCE.
GOING TWICE...

03:57.671 --> 04:00.674
WHAT ABOUT THAT BABY?
SHE LOOKS PRETTY STRONG.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.011
SHALL WE?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.315
THAT'S A TWIST--
THIS TIME I'M LEAVING
WITH THE PROBLEM.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.687
TEDDY, COME ON.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.556
NO, I'M NOT!

04:16.590 --> 04:18.659
OKAY, YOU'RE LEAVING ME
NO CHOICE.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.530
- ( whimpers )
- OH!

04:22.563 --> 04:24.632
WHAT DIED IN THERE?

04:24.665 --> 04:27.635
MY HEART.

04:27.668 --> 04:31.305
YEAH, I THINK THE SMELL IS
COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE
OF YOUR BODY.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.441
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TOOK A SHOWER?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.709
A SHOWER'S NOT GOING
TO WASH AWAY MY PAIN.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.645
OKAY, HOW ABOUT MY PAIN?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.416
COME ON, WE GOTTA BREAK
YOU OUT OF THIS FUNK.
HOW ABOUT SOME MUSIC?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.851
NO, I-- NO, I ALREADY
TRIED THAT.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.554
I LISTENED TO HAPPY SONGS
AND THEY JUST MADE ME

04:46.587 --> 04:48.689
SAD BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE
WERE SO HAPPY

04:48.722 --> 04:50.891
( crying )
AND I'M SO SAD.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.664
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S EVER
HAD THEIR HEART BROKEN?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.466
REMEMBER WHEN EMMETT
AND I BROKE UP?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.868
OH, THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
YOU DUMPED HIM.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.670
AND...

05:02.703 --> 05:04.605
HE'S EMMETT.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.575
LOOK, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.443
- OW!
- YOU GOTTA BRUSH YOUR TEETH,

05:09.477 --> 05:11.111
THEN BRUSH YOUR HAIR.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.347
THEN BRUSH
YOUR TEETH AGAIN,

05:13.381 --> 05:16.617
BECAUSE, GIRL,
THAT BREATH IS NASTY!

05:16.650 --> 05:19.420
IVY, YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.756
NOBODY DOES.
MY BOYFRIEND WAS DATING
ANOTHER GIRL

05:22.790 --> 05:24.825
AT THE SAME TIME
HE WAS DATING ME.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.761
OKAY.
WELL, YOU CAN EITHER
REJOIN THE WORLD,

05:27.795 --> 05:30.898
OR CRAWL BACK UNDER
THOSE COVERS FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE AND BE MISERABLE.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.666
THANK YOU.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.771
THANK YOU.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.807
IT SMELLS
A LOT BETTER NOW.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.586
THERE'S SOME BOXES
IN HERE TOO.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.557
WHOA, WHOSE ROOM
IS THIS?

05:56.590 --> 05:57.691
MY SON RODNEY.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.860
HE LIVES IN FLORIDA NOW.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.130
HE'S MY PRIDE AND JOY,
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:03.163 --> 06:07.401
- WHAT ABOUT MR. DABNEY?
- YEP, LOVE THAT RODNEY.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.705
THIS ROOM
IS SO COOL.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.707
OH, CHECK OUT
THIS BED!

06:17.778 --> 06:20.848
- IT'S MOVING!
- IT'S A WATERBED, DUMMY.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.152
( giggling )

06:25.185 --> 06:27.821
- IT'S LIKE A WATER PARK.
- THE PARK'S CLOSED.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.823
GET OFF!

06:29.857 --> 06:33.561
NOW QUIT YOUR DILLY-DALLYING
AND GET THAT BOX OFF
THE FOOSBALL TABLE.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.863
A FOOSBALL TABLE?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.970
( whimpers )
IT'S LIKE I'M IN HEAVEN.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.905
EXCEPT YOU'RE HERE.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.441
ALL RIGHT,
NOW COME WITH ME.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.443
WE HAVE TO GET SOME STUFF
OUT OF MR. DABNEY'S ROOM.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.446
YOU AND MR. DABNEY
HAVE SEPARATE ROOMS?
MY MOM AND DAD DON'T.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.848
CHECK BACK WITH ME AFTER
THEIR 30th ANNIVERSARY.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.601
RODNEY, LOOKS LIKE YOU
GOT YOURSELF A ROOMMATE.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.536
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:16.704 --> 07:18.005
I'M TALKING TO RODNEY.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.575
NOBODY TALKS
TO RODNEY BUT ME.
COME.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.788
CHARLIE,
THIS IS PATRICIA.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.924
OH, WHAT AN ADORABLE CHILD.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
HAS SHE HAD HER SHOTS?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.762
OF COURSE.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.564
PATRICIA'S GOING
TO WATCH YOU WHILE MOMMY

07:43.597 --> 07:45.766
PUMPS THE IRON,
FEELS THE BURN,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.835
TREADS THE MILL.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.037
I AM SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.707
WE HERE AT FLEX APPEAL FROWN
UPON MEMBERS WHO JOIN THE CLUB

07:53.741 --> 07:55.509

07:55.543 --> 07:57.545
- PEOPLE DO THAT?
- OH YES.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.548
AND IT BURNS MY BUNS.
SOME OF THEM DON'T
EVEN WORK OUT.

08:00.581 --> 08:04.685
THEY DROP OFF THEIR KIDS AND GO
DOWN THE BLOCK TO THE NEW SPA
FOR MASSAGES AND FACIALS.

08:04.718 --> 08:08.055
THAT'S TERRIBLE!
DOWN THE BLOCK, YOU SAY?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.725
WELL, THAT'S MY
FLEX APPEAL SPIEL.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.562

08:18.732 --> 08:21.569
- BYE, SWEETIE.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.880
Man on TV:
Even if we never see
each other again,

08:32.913 --> 08:35.816
I'll love you always.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.852
LIAR!

08:38.886 --> 08:40.821
( doorbell rings )

08:40.854 --> 08:43.591
OH, WHY WON'T THE WORLD
JUST GO AWAY?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.964
SURPRISE.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.834
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:53.867 --> 08:57.304
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL
YOU CAN LOSE THE 'TUDE.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.740
AND SECOND,
I BROUGHT SOMEONE

08:59.773 --> 09:02.109
WHO WILL HELP YOU
OUT OF YOUR FUNK.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.913
TA-DA!

09:05.946 --> 09:07.848
- WHO'S SHE?
- OH, SORRY.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.120
WHAT? SKYLER? YOU BROUGHT
OVER THE GIRL MY BOYFRIEND
CHEATED ON ME WITH?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.988
THIS IS HOW
YOU'RE HELPING ME?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.991
I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE WERE
GOING TO GO OVER TO THE MALL?

09:18.025 --> 09:20.594
THIS IS SO NOT THE MALL.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.931
LOOK, YOU SAID NO ONE

09:23.964 --> 09:27.067
UNDERSTANDS WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
SHE DOES!

09:27.100 --> 09:29.603
NOW GET TO HEALING
AND WHATNOT.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.139
HOW DID YOU
FIND HER ANYWAY?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.977
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
AGAIN, SPENCER.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.013
I WANT THAT GIRL'S
NAME AND NUMBER
AND I WANT IT NOW!

09:41.782 --> 09:44.017
I FOUND HER
ON THE INTERNET.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.853
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HER.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.921
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HER.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.024
LOOK, YOU TWO ARE GOING
TO TALK IT OUT

09:51.058 --> 09:53.961
AND MAKE IT ALL BETTER.
NO ONE'S LEAVING UNTIL THEN.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.032
- I REALLY DON'T SEE
HOW THIS IS GOING TO HELP.
- ME EITHER.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.903
- ( both sobbing )
- IT HURTS!

10:02.936 --> 10:05.873
IT HURTS SO BAD.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.208
DOESN'T SMELL
TOO GOOD EITHER.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.859
FINALLY RUNNING AWAY
FROM HOME, HUH?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.797
JUST REMEMBER, NO MATTER
HOW HOMESICK YOU GET,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.999
JUST KEEP GOING.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.169
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY.
LET'S JUST SAY

10:36.203 --> 10:39.006
- I FOUND A PLACE OF MY OWN.
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:39.039 --> 10:42.075
IT MEANS THAT I GET A ROOM
AND YOU GET A ROOM.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.211
AND THAT'S ALL
I'M GOING TO SAY.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.680
THE LESS YOU KNOW
THE BETTER.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.983
WELL, THEN YOU CAME
TO THE RIGHT GUY.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.086
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
TO MOM AND DAD, RIGHT?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.155
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

10:55.188 --> 10:58.826
I WAS MENTALLY
REARRANGING MY ROOM.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.961
OKAY, THEN,

11:00.994 --> 11:02.730
I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.904
SO LONG, LITTLE BRO.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.909
SEE YOU AT DINNER.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.481
OH, DID SPENCER EVER DO
THAT THING WHERE HE
PRETENDED TO YAWN

11:21.514 --> 11:23.917
- JUST SO HE COULD PUT
HIS ARM AROUND YOU?
- YEAH!

11:23.951 --> 11:26.954
ALL THE TIME.
HEY, DID HE EVER SEND YOU
THOSE "GOOD NIGHT" TEXTS?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.889
YEAH.
"I.M.Y."?

11:28.922 --> 11:32.492
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
- "I MISS YOU."

11:32.525 --> 11:36.096
OH-HHH!
I THOUGHT IT WAS
"I MADE YOGURT."

11:38.498 --> 11:40.768
WELL, DID HE TALK A LOT
ABOUT YOGURT?

11:40.801 --> 11:44.104
NO, NEVER.
THAT'S WHAT CONFUSED ME.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.142
IT IS A GOOD THING
YOU'RE PRETTY.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.112
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
TO ADMIT IT DOES KIND

11:52.145 --> 11:54.114
OF FEEL GOOD TO TALK
ALL THIS STUFF OUT.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.850
IT REALLY DOES.
I DON'T FEEL SO ALONE ANYMORE.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.252
"THANK YOU, IVY!"

12:00.553 --> 12:02.890
SOMEBODY NEEDED
TO SAY IT.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.760
OH, YOU KNOW,
I WAS SO UPSET

12:06.794 --> 12:08.896
I ACTUALLY WROTE A POEM
ABOUT SPENCER.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.231
REALLY?
I WAS SO UPSET I WROTE
A SONG ABOUT HIM.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.500
WELL, JUST THE MUSIC.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.502
I COULDN'T COME UP
WITH THE... THE...

12:15.535 --> 12:17.971
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THAT YOU PUT INTO SONGS?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.506
- LYRICS?
- NO.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.009
THE WORDS
THAT YOU SING.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.180
OH MY GOSH.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.017
OOOH, I LIKE THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYE.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.185
WHY SHOULD WE BE MISERABLE

12:32.219 --> 12:34.988
WHEN WE COULD
MAKE HIM MISERABLE?

12:35.022 --> 12:37.891
IVY'S GETTING TINGLY.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.128
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.331
WE'RE GONNA GET EVEN.

12:44.364 --> 12:48.068
- WITH SPENCER.
- OH-HHH!

12:48.101 --> 12:51.138
LYRICS!
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLED.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.984
- MORNING, DAD.
- HI.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.820
OH, MAN, I HAD A GREAT
NIGHT'S SLEEP.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.889
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.924
NO, IT WAS LIKE
HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.094
I MEAN, HE WAS THERE...

13:14.127 --> 13:16.129
IT JUST FELT LIKE
HE WASN'T THERE.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.165
BUT HE WAS THERE.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.001
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.270
NOTHING.
DAD!

13:23.303 --> 13:26.039
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.
MAYBE I'M FINALLY
GROWING UP.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.275
OOOH, PANCAKES!
YUMMY NUM NUM!

13:32.179 --> 13:35.148
MORNING, EVERYBODY.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.388
WHY ARE YOU SWAYING?

13:41.421 --> 13:44.391
GUESS I DON'T HAVE
MY LAND LEGS YET.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.293
- WHAT?!
- UH...

13:46.326 --> 13:50.163
I HAD A DREAM
I WAS ON A BOAT.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.900
WHICH EXPLAINS
WHY YOU KEPT MUMBLING

13:52.933 --> 13:55.402
"AHOY, MATEY"
IN YOUR SLEEP.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.971
DON'T HELP ME.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.013
OKAY, LADIES,

14:06.046 --> 14:09.182
SPENCER WALSH SLAP DOWN,

CHOREOGRAPHED

14:17.690 --> 14:20.627

14:20.660 --> 14:23.030
HOW COME YOU
GET YOUR FULL NAME?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.198
BECAUSE I'M THE DIRECTOR.

14:26.666 --> 14:30.437
OKAY, WE'RE FEELING
ANGRY ABOUT SPENCER,

14:30.470 --> 14:34.007
ON... ACTION!

14:34.041 --> 14:38.178
( ballad playing )
* I THOUGHT HE WAS
THE IDEAL CATCH *

14:38.211 --> 14:42.449
* HE SAID WE WERE
A PERFECT MATCH *

14:42.482 --> 14:46.319
* I THOUGHT WE HAD
A LOVE SO SWEET *

14:46.353 --> 14:51.124
* UNTIL I FOUND OUT HE WAS

14:51.158 --> 14:53.060
* A BIG OLD CHEAT!

14:53.093 --> 14:55.328
( hip-hop music playing )
* HEY, EVERYBODY

14:55.362 --> 14:57.264
* CAN YOU DIG?

14:57.297 --> 15:00.033
* SPENCER WALSH IS
A TWO-TIMING PIG *

15:00.067 --> 15:04.004
* A FOOTBALL PLAYER
WITH BIG DREAMY EYES *

15:04.037 --> 15:07.474
* BUT EVERYTHING HE SAID
TURNS OUT TO BE LIES *

15:07.507 --> 15:11.344
* NOW EXCUSE ME
IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DIS *

15:11.378 --> 15:15.082
* BUT THAT FOOL DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO KISS *

15:15.115 --> 15:18.218
* HE WAS DATING HER
WHILE HE WAS DATING ME *

15:18.251 --> 15:22.055
* NOW THAT BIG LOSER
IS HISTORY *

15:22.089 --> 15:24.124
* HEY, EVERYBODY

15:24.157 --> 15:26.093
* CAN YOU DIG?

15:26.126 --> 15:29.429
* SPENCER WALSH IS
A TWO-TIMING PIG! *

15:37.737 --> 15:40.974
LADIES, THAT WAS PERFECT.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.244
NOW JUST ONE MORE TAKE
AND THIS TIME I'LL HIT RECORD.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.055
- NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
- P.J.!

15:55.088 --> 15:57.724
- HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
- I LIVE NEXT DOOR.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.160
I WATCHED YOU.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.962
DUDE, THIS IS AWESOME.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.035
- IS THAT A WATERBED?
- OH YEAH.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.475
- ( laughs )
- THAT WAS SO COOL!

16:15.508 --> 16:17.377
- LET ME DO YOU, READY?
- OKAY.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.979
GO FOR IT.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.084
I THOUGHT THAT
WOULD BE MORE FUN.

16:24.117 --> 16:27.120
DUDE, THIS IS
SO SWEET, MAN.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.389
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
HERE-- WATERBED,

16:29.422 --> 16:32.059
- COMIC BOOKS--
- DON'T FORGET FOOSBALL.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.527
OH. ( laughs )
IT'S LIKE I'M IN HEAVEN.

16:34.561 --> 16:38.065
EXCEPT YOU'RE HERE.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.401
AND WHAT'S IN HERE,
YOU MIGHT ASK.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.038
MY OWN BATHROOM.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.174
YOUR OWN BATHROOM.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.542
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO,
BUT I'M GONNA FORCE MYSELF.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.232
WHOO!

17:17.470 --> 17:19.172
HI, CHARLIE!

17:21.608 --> 17:23.543
- HEY, BABY.
- GOOD WORKOUT TODAY?

17:23.576 --> 17:26.313
OH, IT WAS GREAT.
REALLY PUSHED IT TO THE LIMIT.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.216
OH, WHERE EXACTLY
DID YOU PUSH IT?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.652
BECAUSE I WAS
IN THE WORKOUT ROOM EARLIER
AND I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.556
BECAUSE I WAS AT THE POOL.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.259
WE DON'T HAVE A POOL.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.629
OKAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE POOL
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING

17:42.662 --> 17:44.497
BY THE STAIR CLIMBER
THINGAMAJIGGY.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.100
UH-HUH.
YOU KNOW, MRS. DUNCAN,

17:47.134 --> 17:49.236
WHEN I ADD A "MAJIGGY"
TO THE END OF A WORD

17:49.269 --> 17:52.572
IT USUALLY MEANS I'M TRYING
TO HIDE SOMETHING.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.574
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
- OH?

17:54.607 --> 17:57.610
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M LATE FOR A...

17:57.644 --> 18:00.313
VERY IMPORTANT
THINGAMABOB.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.457
HEY, IVY, CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.525
I JUST FINISHED EDITING
OUR MUSIC VIDEO

18:12.559 --> 18:14.394
AND IT LOOKS AMAZING!

18:14.427 --> 18:17.197
I CAN'T WAIT TO UPLOAD IT.
THIS WILL RUIN SPENCER.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.565
( doorbell rings )

18:18.598 --> 18:20.433
OH, THERE'S SKYLER.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.302
OKAY.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.143
HI.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.412
SPENCER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.582
- CAN I COME IN?
- I DON'T THINK THAT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.918
LOOK, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.288
- THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.
- YES, THERE IS.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.257
I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SORRY
I AM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.259
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.895
HANGING OUT WITH SKYLER WAS
THE STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.298
TEDDY,

18:51.331 --> 18:53.266
YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANT TO BE WITH.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.603
- SPENCER, I--
- LOOK!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.206
I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE IT,

18:59.239 --> 19:01.308
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.243
WE CAN JUST START OVER?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.580
NO, I CAN'T.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.617
I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN TRUST YOU.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.485
I'M SORRY.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.423
ME TOO.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.503
( moans )
JOINING THAT GYM
UP THE STREET

19:30.537 --> 19:33.673
IS THE SMARTEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.379
OH, JUST GO
A LITTLE DEEPER ON THE GLUTES,
I'VE GOT FOUR KIDS.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.249
OH YEAH!
THAT'S THE SPOT.

19:42.282 --> 19:46.319
OH, LOTS OF TENSION THERE.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.389
Charlie: MAMAMA.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.559
HI, CHARLIE.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.227
CHARLIE?!

19:54.261 --> 19:57.330
YOUR MEMBERSHIP
HAS BEEN REVOKED.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.788
- HI.
- ( screams )

20:21.821 --> 20:25.592
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I'M TAKING MY TURN
IN THE COOL ROOM.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.794
- WE'RE NOT TAKING TURNS.
- YES, WE ARE.

20:27.827 --> 20:31.298
- AND TONIGHT IS MY TURN.
- WELL, I'M NOT LEAVING.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.400
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.667
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.269
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.
- WELL, NEITHER AM I!

20:36.303 --> 20:37.537
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.805
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.
- WELL, NEITHER AM I.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.414
WELL?

20:47.447 --> 20:51.284
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.459
Hi, Charlie.
So, um...

20:59.492 --> 21:02.429
I decided not to put
the Spencer video online.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.498
I mean, just because somebody
hurts you doesn't mean you need
to hurt them back.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.401
So do what I did.
Find some friends to help
you get through it.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.304
Oh, when we get done
talking to your sister,

21:11.338 --> 21:13.473
are we gonna put
the Spencer video online?

21:16.443 --> 21:19.846
Uh, no.
That's kind of the whole
point of what I just said.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.750
I don't get you.
I mean,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.619
I don't get a lot of things,
but I really don't get you.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.591
This is Skyler.
Isn't she pretty?

21:33.660 --> 21:36.396
Wish her
good luck, Charlie.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.807
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.343
NO ONE'S GOING TO KEEP ME
OUT OF THIS ROOM.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.911
- OR ME.
- NO!

21:54.381 --> 21:56.649
COME ON, CHARLIE.
WE CAN ALL SHARE.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.756
YAY!

22:03.790 --> 22:05.892
Mrs. Dabney:
BUDDHA, WHERE ARE YOU,
KITTY CAT?

22:05.925 --> 22:07.527
UH-OH.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.906
AHA.
CHARLIE?

22:19.939 --> 22:21.941
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.917
- YOU UP FOR A LITTLE FOOSBALL?
- NO!
