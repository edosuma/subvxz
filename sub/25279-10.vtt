WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:08.591
[Rooster] Hey, Nick.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.636
You're in my house.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.182
Um...

00:20.687 --> 00:22.188
I'll probably have to make a phone call

00:22.272 --> 00:26.067
because my alarm system's
connected to the police,

00:26.151 --> 00:30.238
and they give them the alert
if there's an intruder, so...

00:30.321 --> 00:31.698
They're probably on their way now.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.744
Was Mary here last night?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.121
Mary?

00:38.204 --> 00:41.624
Oh, you mean Mary from the bar,
Nick's Mary.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.462
No, man. No, I haven't seen her.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.716
Are you sure? 'Cause she got home
real late last night.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.677
Oh, shit, huh?

00:53.720 --> 00:57.182
I don't want to get anybody
in trouble or nothing, but, um...

00:57.932 --> 00:58.933
[smacks lips]

00:59.642 --> 01:01.770
I think Colt might be fucking her.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.064
This a joke?

01:09.527 --> 01:11.529
I will fucking kill you.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.535
I don't know what to tell you, all right?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.079
I'm not seeing Mary.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.038
[knock at door]

01:23.416 --> 01:26.711
If that's her,
she's probably here looking for you.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
[Colt] Rooster. Talladega?

01:32.091 --> 01:33.176
That's my brother.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.596
He's just checking to see
whether or not I'm naked.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.597
Daytona.

01:38.973 --> 01:39.974
[Colt] Hey.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.643
Oh.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.604
Hey, Nick.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.231
What you doing here?

01:47.148 --> 01:50.401
Oh. Hey, Colt, man. I was just leaving.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.116
See you around, Rooster.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.535
[door closes]

01:59.369 --> 02:01.121
He knows my name.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.416
What the hell happened here?

02:07.710 --> 02:09.170
[exhales deeply] Well...

02:09.838 --> 02:11.798
Nick broke into my house

02:11.881 --> 02:15.343
and he was sitting on my couch,
waiting for me in the dark.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.928
And he says he's going to kill me.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.888
Holy shit.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.767
-Does he know about you and Mary?
-No.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.645
I told him it was some other dude.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.565
Oh, that's smart. [chuckles softly]
That guy's screwed.

02:29.607 --> 02:34.112
Look at this. This guy's sitting here,
eating my Cocoa Puffs with water.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.114
Water.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.241
That guy's a fucking psycho.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.328
Maybe we need to pay him a little visit.

02:43.621 --> 02:47.917
[sighs deeply] No, man, I don't wanna
get you all involved in this shit.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.545
[sighs] Thank God.
That guy creeps me out, man.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.547
[imitates Buffalo Bill]
"It puts the lotion on its skin

02:52.630 --> 02:55.008
or it gets the hose again."

02:57.886 --> 02:58.761
[Rooster sighs] Damn.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.388
Why're you here, anyway?

03:00.471 --> 03:04.475
Dad decided
he hasn't fucked up our lives enough,

03:04.559 --> 03:06.102
so he's selling the Peterson Ranch.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.645
What?

03:08.563 --> 03:12.233
He's throwing away a ranch 'cause
of some stupid generator?

03:13.651 --> 03:15.153
It don't make no sense. [scoffs]

03:15.236 --> 03:19.407
You don't throw away a beer
'cause it's got a cigarette butt in it.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.577
You squeeze another lime in
and keep drinking.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.704
I don't know why he'd do it. [stammers]

03:24.787 --> 03:29.167
Maybe I've been right all along
and my tears give him strength.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.671
I mean, this don't make no fucking sense.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.715
We're a month out from market?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.801
We need that money
to get through next year.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.803
By the way, you do cry a lot.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.598
[sighs]

03:44.224 --> 03:46.351
I ain't working for Dad anymore.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.729
I ain't living with Dad anymore.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.483
Cool if I stay the night here?

03:54.651 --> 03:55.735
Yeah, I guess.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.197
All right.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.699
I'll run over to the house.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.494
-Get some of my clothes and my product.
-[scoffs]

04:04.577 --> 04:06.746
Jesus, can you not call it that?

04:06.829 --> 04:11.125
Oh, I'm sorry if I don't clean myself
with a busted dishwasher pod.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.506
Sometimes I like to take a shower
and do my dishes in one shot.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.133
Hey.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.135
Thank you.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.017
[theme song playing]

05:28.286 --> 05:31.539
[Abby over phone] <i>I'm as disappointed</i>
<i>about the Peterson place as you are.</i>

05:31.622 --> 05:34.375
Me, too.
I wanna live out our days there,

05:34.459 --> 05:36.753
getting shitfaced
and putting babies in you.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.464
Hey, Joanne.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.632
[Abby] <i>Hi, Joanne. </i>

05:41.716 --> 05:44.719
<i>That sounded pretty weird,</i>
<i>but it was kinda sweet.</i>

05:44.802 --> 05:47.764
It's fine.
It's the redneck American dream.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.643
Hey, baby, I'll try you back later.
Love you.

05:52.727 --> 05:53.978
[Abby] <i>Bye. I love you.</i>

05:56.898 --> 05:58.357
Sorry about that.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.069
Why're you up so late?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.029
Oh. [sighs]

06:03.112 --> 06:06.157
Before bed, I like a cup of tea
with a splash of whiskey.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.536
I like to start my day
with a shot of whiskey and a SlimFast.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.916
That way, I catch a buzz
and watch my figure all at the same time.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.502
Hey, uh...

06:18.711 --> 06:20.588
we haven't talked much
since you've been here.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.175
I'm sorry about your house and all.

06:24.759 --> 06:29.514
Well, thank you. It's just stuff,
a lot of stuff. [chuckles softly]

06:29.597 --> 06:33.559
Everything I ever worked for or valued
or cherished, but I'm fine.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.189
I wish it was
under better circumstances, but...

06:38.856 --> 06:40.066
we're glad you're here.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.944
Thank you. I appreciate it.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.530
Honestly, it's been a hard few days.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.241
-It's an adjustment for everybody.
-Yeah.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.577
Have you adjusted to the fact
that my dad's a horse's ass?

06:51.661 --> 06:52.703
Tea helps.

06:55.289 --> 06:59.502
When I was living away from my dad,
I was sober the whole time.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.753
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.922
I only drank beer and wine.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.968
Did you and your dad talk?
Figure things out?

07:08.594 --> 07:09.929
Yeah.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.474
He figured out
how to crush my hopes and dreams

07:13.558 --> 07:14.851
by selling the Peterson Ranch.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.353
I figured out he's a shitty father
and I'm leaving.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.605
Okay, you need this more than I do.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.692
Cheers.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.361
[gulps] Ooh.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.864
I can hardly taste the tea.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.409
There was never any tea.
What am I, fucking British?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.246
When you say you're leaving,

07:35.955 --> 07:39.250
what do you mean?
The house, or the ranch or the country?

07:39.333 --> 07:42.962
Oh, not the country.
I can't afford a plane ticket.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.549
And the two countries I can drive to
got pictures of me at the border.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.345
What, then? You got a child on the way.
What will you do?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.724
The only thing I know how to do
is football and ranching.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.227
Last time I played football,
I threw five interceptions.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.314
And that was
at the Bennett Family Turkey Bowl.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.608
I think Aunt Doris is juicing.

08:04.358 --> 08:08.029
That leaves ranching.
You can't be any worse at that.

08:08.112 --> 08:08.988
Can you?

08:10.364 --> 08:13.576
I'm good at ranching.
There's only two plays to memorize:

08:13.659 --> 08:16.496
Feed the cow. Kill the cow.
And if you forget the first one,

08:16.579 --> 08:19.165
the second one just takes care of itself.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.251
You're not one to give up easy.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.629
Your dad said you were cut from 20 teams.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.466
That's 19 times you didn't believe someone
who said you were shitty.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.469
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right, then.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.221
How about you get your shit together?

08:34.096 --> 08:35.431
Yes, ma'am.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.811
I appreciate the talk.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.900
It's been a rough go,
but I think you're right.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.654
I'm gonna get sober again.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.873
Hey, Heather, thanks for coming.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.959
Okay, what the hell is going on?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.336
You sent me ten text messages.

09:05.419 --> 09:09.382
"911. This is an emergency.
Come to my cabin.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.677
This is not a booty call.
Unless you're down."

09:14.387 --> 09:19.850
I didn't wanna send it to you in a text,
but, man...

09:20.476 --> 09:22.728
You're right about Nick. He's crazy.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.854
What happened?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.732
Nick broke into my house.

09:26.816 --> 09:31.195
I come home, and he's sitting on my couch
like a hillbilly gargoyle.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.030
-What the fuck?
-Yeah.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.617
He's lucky my sensei taught me
some restraint.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.745
[stammers] Why are you telling me?
Have you told my mom?

09:39.829 --> 09:40.955
No.

09:41.038 --> 09:44.584
I'm afraid if I call or text her,
he'll see it and freak out.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.669
Will you talk to her?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.713
I'm worried. I wanna make sure she's okay.

09:48.796 --> 09:53.217
Yeah, of course, I'll talk to her.
What about you? You all right?

09:53.301 --> 09:56.887
Yeah, you ain't gotta worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

09:57.638 --> 09:58.848
Kenny Chesney!

10:00.391 --> 10:02.351
Did you say, "Kenny Chesney"?

10:03.561 --> 10:06.647
I channeled the most powerful thing
I could think of.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.984
Ugh. I'll talk to my mom.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.153
All right.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.702
Thank you.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.374
Thanks for meeting with me again,
Ms. Neumann.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.460
This is becoming a bit of a habit.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.795
Yeah. [chuckles]

10:29.879 --> 10:31.339
Sorry about that.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.300
Uh, as you see, I come hat in hand,

10:34.383 --> 10:37.428
which is a big deal for me,
'cause my hair is a mess.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.306
I rolled the dice on a new conditioner.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.350
Thanks a lot, Charlize Theron.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.812
Whoa.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.940
-Is that a Broncos football?
-Yep.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.817
Signed by the whole team.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.862
That's awesome.
You got a little blank space there.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.490
Please don't sign my football, Colt.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.117
Not the first time I heard that.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.828
So, what can I do for you?

11:06.123 --> 11:07.750
I know you want to buy the Peterson Ranch.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.213
My wife's pregnant with our first kid.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.841
It's always been my dream
to raise our family on that ranch.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.053
-You've done a lot for us already--
-Okay.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.639
Let me stop you right there, Colt.
[chuckles softly]

11:21.722 --> 11:24.225
This is a business decision.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.895
Your dad wants to sell that ranch
and if I don't buy it, someone else will.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.274
And I'm sorry if this is hard
for you, but...

11:32.358 --> 11:34.610
Hey, do you wanna sign this ball?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.697
I don't want to stop you from buying it.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.494
I just... When the deal's closed,
I wanna run it for you.

11:44.912 --> 11:45.788
Really?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.332
Nobody else you hire will be
more motivated

11:48.416 --> 11:49.792
to make that thing work than me.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.002
And no one knows that land
as well as I do.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.713
I don't know. I hired your brother

11:54.797 --> 11:57.842
and we still got viruses
on all the computers.

11:57.925 --> 12:01.262
Look, Rooster didn't have
nothing to work for. I do.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.056
I will work twice as hard for less money.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.934
You said so yourself.
It's a business decision, right?

12:07.017 --> 12:09.687
How can hiring a great rancher
for a great price

12:09.770 --> 12:11.105
be a bad business decision?

12:13.065 --> 12:15.734
I am willing to give you a shot
at running that ranch,

12:15.818 --> 12:18.696
if you get your dad's blessing first.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.614
Seriously? You'll hire me?

12:21.198 --> 12:22.283
If he says it's okay.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.119
Okay. All right, thank you.
This is awesome. [chuckles]

12:25.202 --> 12:26.162
I...

12:27.455 --> 12:30.833
Now that we've entered a negotiation,
I'd like to counter.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.002
Could you ask my dad for me?

12:33.085 --> 12:33.961
No.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.547
That's all right.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.799
-Will you come with me when I ask him?
-No.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.176
Damn it.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.052
Can I really sign the football?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.930
-No.
-Okay. Yeah, good talk. [chuckles]

12:50.311 --> 12:52.354
So, how do the Neumann's Hill cattle look?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.356
Really good. I'll show you.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.860
I got a new iPhone with a portrait mode.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.197
[chuckles] It used to
if you wanted a picture this good,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.491
you'd have to take your cow to Sears.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.453
I know. I got your Christmas card.

13:08.996 --> 13:14.585
So, um... how's everything going
with Joanne moving in here?

13:16.378 --> 13:17.296
Fine.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.508
Now, what'd you do wrong?

13:21.258 --> 13:23.636
She wanted to talk and I didn't.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.306
Not unlike the current situation
I find myself in.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.725
Well, that's tough.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.478
You wanna talk about it?

13:34.063 --> 13:38.901
On top of that, she replaced my coffee pot
with a fancy pod machine.

13:39.860 --> 13:44.573
Worst part is, I kinda liked it,
even though the vanilla was French.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.161
You got a Keurig? What model?

13:49.745 --> 13:53.374
I got whichever one takes 20 minutes
to make a cup of coffee.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.629
So... her house burns down.

13:58.712 --> 14:02.633
She buys you a gift
and then she wants to talk.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.803
Why, that woman's got a lot of nerve.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.473
You're gonna have to apologize.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.393
She's avoiding me.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.729
She was up and off to work
before I woke up today.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.817
I think I'm too old
to start a new relationship.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.904
Ah, don't blame age,
you grumpy son of a bitch.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.574
I'm old, but I'm a delight.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.160
If you don't want her in your life,

14:30.244 --> 14:32.872
why did you ask her to come stay
to begin with?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.541
I didn't say I didn't want her in my life.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.793
If that's true, you gotta show her.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.840
When I screw up with Charlene,
I apologize with the three F's:

14:43.549 --> 14:47.803
flowers, foot rub and Fuddruckers.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.432
I hate that place.

14:51.932 --> 14:55.436
Why am I paying
if I gotta build my own damn burger?

14:55.936 --> 15:01.025
Yeah, you don't deserve Joanne,
but, uh, seem like she don't know it.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.819
So, if I were you,
I'd do everything I could

15:03.903 --> 15:05.404
to keep her in the dark.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.992
-Hey, Dale.
-Hey, Colt.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.245
[sighs] Dad, I need to talk to you.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.540
I heard enough from you last night.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.085
Okay, then.
Well, I'll give you two some space.

15:20.169 --> 15:24.757
Unlike Charlene's sister,
I know when I'm not wanted.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.053
-Your truck's over there.
-[Dale] I know.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.097
I'm gonna make myself a Keurig
for the road.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.021
I talked to Lisa Neumann
about buying that Peterson Ranch.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.523
Yeah, so?

15:42.107 --> 15:46.278
Well, if you sell it...
I'm gonna run it for her.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.322
Is that a fact?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.827
I'm gonna raise my family on that ranch.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.081
She said it's okay if you say it's okay.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.627
So you can stop me if you want.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.631
Either way, I'm never working here again.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.231
Hey.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.150
-[sighs]
-I got your text.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.487
So... Nick's gone?

16:28.570 --> 16:29.571
Yeah.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.782
Heather told me what happened,
so I broke up with him.

16:31.865 --> 16:36.245
Oh, no, you broke up?
Nick was a great guy.

16:40.207 --> 16:43.043
It seems I've misread the room.
Good night.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.047
You okay?

16:47.756 --> 16:51.552
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.346
No, come on. I was just worried about you.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.348
Believe me. I can handle Nick.

16:57.307 --> 17:01.145
But, uh... do you happen to know
where he is? Or...

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
how mad he is or who he's mad at?

17:05.983 --> 17:08.694
Don't worry.
He asked me if this was about you.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.237
I told him if I'd cheat with a Bennett,

17:10.320 --> 17:14.867
it was gonna be with Beau or Colt,
not the short, little hairy weirdo.

17:15.909 --> 17:19.121
Yeah, well, you probably could have
just told him no.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.791
-God, he is so paranoid and possessive.
-[sighs]

17:22.875 --> 17:26.170
That night he saw us here
at the bar, he went mental.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.256
He started throwing bottles
and saying he'd kill you.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.759
Cool.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.094
And that's before you dumped him?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.555
[stammers] It's over.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.308
He packed up his shit
and went to his brother's in Ohio.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.769
If your brakes didn't seem to be cut
on the way here,

17:41.852 --> 17:43.020
you're good.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.775
[inhales deeply]
When you texted me to come over,

17:47.858 --> 17:51.612
you couldn't just give me a heads-up?
Maybe my brakes got cut?

17:51.695 --> 17:52.863
[Mary chuckles]

17:54.656 --> 17:55.491
You all right?

17:57.618 --> 18:01.205
I don't know why I thought
things were gonna be different this time.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.876
Sort of like him, trying to rob
the same Circle K twice.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.878
Just because it's an ampm now

18:07.961 --> 18:10.881
does not mean they don't have
cameras everywhere.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.383
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.513
I know this situation
caused you a lot of stress.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.892
If you don't wanna be alone,
you can come over.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.561
I went to McDonald's
the last day of the McRib.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.688
I bought 30 of 'em.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.232
They're in the freezer.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.945
I'm not saying I wouldn't be
up for that down the line, but...

18:33.904 --> 18:37.533
[sighs] I think right now I gotta
take some time for myself.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.701
Yeah, makes sense.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.871
Bummer, though. [smacks lips]

18:42.955 --> 18:46.375
I'll have to find someone else
to give this WrestleMania ticket to.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.918
[clicks tongue]

18:48.001 --> 18:50.671
Upper deck. Row L...

18:53.257 --> 18:54.091
L.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.104
Hey, Joanne.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.816
Hey, Beau, what are you doing here?

19:11.316 --> 19:15.195
Actually, I'm waiting for Chad
to come back with my biscuits.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.656
What's he doing, milling the flour?

19:19.950 --> 19:22.411
You want a cup of coffee?
It's shitty, so you'll like it.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.581
I didn't wanna bother you at work,

19:25.664 --> 19:28.083
but I didn't know if I'd get a chance
to talk to you later.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.461
I wanted to say sorry.

19:32.337 --> 19:36.550
I appreciate it, but I don't think
you know what you're apologizing for.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.513
For being grumpy... and stubborn...

19:42.389 --> 19:43.390
and...

19:45.225 --> 19:47.352
Want to go to Fuddruckers later?

19:47.978 --> 19:51.732
[scoffs] What? Why would I pay someone
if I have to build my own burger?

19:51.815 --> 19:54.151
You are an amazing woman.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.029
You think I don't know that?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.742
Look, Beau, um...

20:03.952 --> 20:06.038
I think moving in was a mistake.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.123
So...

20:08.207 --> 20:09.958
I'll stay at the Holiday Inn,

20:10.042 --> 20:13.378
and we can go back
to seeing each other once in a while.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.381
-Is that what you want?
-No.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.426
But I won't be dismissed
and condescended to.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.304
If I wanted that,
I'd sit here in my own section.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.349
I really am sorry.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.560
I know I push people away.

20:29.436 --> 20:33.273
I did that with Maggie
and now I'm doing it with you.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.443
It's not just the women in your life.
It's everybody.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.528
Look what's going on with your sons.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.448
I've been trying to push them away
for years.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.827
Joke all you want,
but Colt's on his way out the door.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.746
No, he's not going anywhere.

20:48.455 --> 20:52.709
He conned Lisa Neumann into letting him
run the Peterson Ranch after I sell it.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.670
Good for him.

20:56.171 --> 21:00.384
Hey, if he were anyone else's kid,
you'd probably respect his drive.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.261
You were gonna sell it
right out from under him,

21:02.344 --> 21:04.680
but he found a way to stay there.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.307
I miss when you called him "shithead."

21:09.601 --> 21:12.396
Well, Lisa came by with an offer.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.147
And it's a good one.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.067
And it'll finally put
that Peterson mess behind us.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.737
Is it a good enough deal that
it's worth driving your sons away?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.239
And your grandchild?

21:24.199 --> 21:25.659
I came here to talk about us.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.829
Oh, sure, because your sons
are none of my business.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.331
Oh, no, I'm... I... [sighs]

21:32.916 --> 21:36.003
Look, we can talk and talk,
but unless you do something different,

21:36.086 --> 21:39.381
you'll end up in the same place
with me and your sons.

21:39.965 --> 21:40.799
I can change.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.428
Well, I heard that before,
but I've never seen it. [scoffs]

21:53.520 --> 21:54.354
Hey.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.607
Don't worry.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.943
I ain't stealing nothing.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.655
Unless this is your probiotic yogurt.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.824
I don't know what that is,

22:06.325 --> 22:09.828
but I did use some on the door
to stop it from squeaking.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.875
I need to talk to you
about the Peterson Ranch.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.545
You talked to Lisa?

22:19.212 --> 22:20.255
Just sit down.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.936
I know I've been hard on you
and your brother for a long time.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.648
You don't have to pause.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.358
If I disagree, I'll jump in.

22:42.611 --> 22:46.448
I was thinking about that
father-and-son camping trip

22:46.531 --> 22:49.159
with the Boy Scouts at Miramonte.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.287
The one we never went on
'cause you grounded us?

22:52.954 --> 22:54.039
Yeah.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.211
You and Rooster begged and cried

22:59.294 --> 23:02.756
and swore up and down
you'd never skip your chores again.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.887
Your mom said I could ground you
after we came back.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.391
But I was determined
to teach you a lesson,

23:14.935 --> 23:18.105
'cause I thought that's what
a father was supposed to do.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.942
And then...

23:22.025 --> 23:25.737
Then the next year came
and you were both out of the Scouts.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.406
So, we never went.

23:29.991 --> 23:30.951
So?

23:31.034 --> 23:35.080
It was a chance we had to grow closer.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.462
And, instead, I drove us further apart.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.051
It's a memory we'll never have...

23:50.220 --> 23:52.180
and a time we'll never get back.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.644
It's just one trip.

24:00.772 --> 24:06.486
And the thing you remember most about
winning your conference championship...

24:07.737 --> 24:10.198
is me yelling at you in the parking lot.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.457
And when Rooster got his own ranch,

24:21.918 --> 24:25.255
instead of telling him congratulations...

24:28.300 --> 24:30.135
I told him he wasn't ready.

24:34.681 --> 24:38.143
I can give you 50 more examples
of the same thing.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.066
You want some advice
on how to raise your daughter?

24:47.235 --> 24:49.154
Do the opposite of what I did.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.406
Dad...

24:56.828 --> 24:58.580
I can't change the past.

25:01.499 --> 25:05.754
But I can try to make some changes
for the future.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.967
The Peterson Ranch is yours.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.933
You told Lisa it's okay?

25:18.516 --> 25:23.063
No, I told her I wasn't selling it,
because I was leaving it to my sons.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.064
Holy shit.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.358
You run it how you see fit.

25:27.692 --> 25:33.281
I'll just be your grumpy neighbor who will
shoot at you if you come on my land.

25:36.076 --> 25:36.910
You serious?

25:37.702 --> 25:41.539
Sink or swim,
it's on you and your brother.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.962
-That's all we ever wanted.
-Well...

25:48.046 --> 25:49.214
You got it now.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.471
[smacks lips] Thank you.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.977
Congratulations on your daughter.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.855
I can't wait to meet her.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.819
I love you.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.198
[Colt sniffling]

26:15.282 --> 26:16.741
I love you, too, Dad.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.539
You won't regret it.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.667
We'll make you proud.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.627
I know you will.

26:28.461 --> 26:31.339
Oh, shit. I gotta call Rooster.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.175
First thing tomorrow,
we gotta disc up that west pasture.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.178
Oh, wait a minute.
The first thing you wanna do is...

26:38.596 --> 26:42.183
You know what?
That's a perfectly fine idea.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.102
You know what? You're right.

26:44.185 --> 26:48.398
The first thing we gotta do is those
electrical cow tags like Neumann's Hill.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.068
Maybe it's better
if I don't know what you're doing.

27:03.830 --> 27:04.789
Hey, Joanne.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.666
Hey, Beau.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.793
[chuckles]

27:08.877 --> 27:10.211
Is that bird feeder for me

27:10.295 --> 27:13.298
or you just trying to lure in the crows
for target practice?

27:14.341 --> 27:15.800
Why can't it be both?

27:17.052 --> 27:20.597
I was thinking you could
wake up in the morning,

27:20.680 --> 27:23.725
and sit out here with your cup of coffee
and watch the birds.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.061
That is just too sweet.

27:26.644 --> 27:27.937
Just like your coffee.

27:30.106 --> 27:32.150
It's really beautiful.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.152
Look at the detail. [chuckles softly]

27:34.944 --> 27:38.490
Oh, I like the little
"Trespassers will be shot" sign.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.949
[both chuckle]

27:40.033 --> 27:43.078
We would make one of those
every year when I was a scout.

27:43.661 --> 27:46.498
I could also make a pinewood derby car...

27:47.082 --> 27:48.625
that would probably
run better than your Chevy.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.338
I gave the Peterson Ranch to the boys.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.590
Wow.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.968
They got a ranch?
I just got this bird feeder?

27:59.636 --> 28:02.263
Oh, don't forget. You also get me.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.060
-Boy, they made out like bandits.
-[both chuckle]

28:08.186 --> 28:10.230
I appreciate all your advice.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.525
It was helpful and you were right.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.569
I know. That's why I said it.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.613
I want you to stay here.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.907
I want you to be a part of my life.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.744
I'm sorry if I haven't made that clear.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.830
Well, thank you.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.416
I wanna stay here, too.

28:31.459 --> 28:35.046
And sorry I left your chicken fried
steak in the window for 20 minutes

28:35.130 --> 28:37.507
so it was nice and cool
when I served it to you.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.344
-Yeah, and I'm sorry I didn't leave a tip.
-[chuckles]

28:42.887 --> 28:43.722
Look...

28:43.805 --> 28:48.768
I know I'm a work in progress,
but I want you to know I am working at it.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.855
Every time I try to throw you
in the water,

28:51.938 --> 28:53.857
you just flop right back in the boat.

28:54.357 --> 28:57.318
Just like when I was
teachin' the boys how to swim.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.779
Shit...

29:00.280 --> 29:02.407
I really was a horrible father.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.507
-[Nick] Hey, Rooster.
-Jesus Christ!

29:21.468 --> 29:22.844
You scared the shit out of me.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.724
So, you got two choices.

29:28.516 --> 29:33.563
You either take that bag and disappear,
or you could just disappear.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.026
How about you got two choices?

29:38.610 --> 29:42.822
You get the fuck out of my cabin
or I can kick in all your teeth.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.074
And we'll make this meth-head look
of yours complete.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.786
Well, then...

29:49.746 --> 29:51.331
I'll just say it again.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.835
Take the bag and disappear

29:57.253 --> 29:58.505
or you disappear.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.146
Rooster...

30:16.481 --> 30:18.441
you tell anyone about this,

30:19.818 --> 30:21.861
and I'll start with your family.
