but this right here,
this is what's important.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.855
As long as we have each other's backs,

00:22.564 --> 00:25.150
can't nothing touch the Upshaws.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.110
Come on, baby. Say that again.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.821
'Cause you know I got your back,

00:33.950 --> 00:35.702
[Bennie] You know what I mean?

00:35.785 --> 00:38.204
Is this where Bennie Upshaw lives?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.957
Um, who's asking?

00:41.041 --> 00:41.875
His daughter.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.171
Nigga, really?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.340
I was just about to start loving you.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.634
All right, Bennie, your choice.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.597
You can walk out of here on your own
or rolled up in one of these cheap rugs.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.974
Regina, tell King to heel.

00:58.516 --> 00:59.934
I can get a new rug.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.437
Dang! Bye, Daddy.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.481
Oh, no. This is some bullshit.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.400
Little girl, who is your mother?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.486
That's your first question?

01:09.569 --> 01:10.570
And it ain't yours?

01:11.154 --> 01:15.325
We can't make this little girl out to be a
lying ass ho. We need her momma for that.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.286
Am I a ghetto twin too?

01:18.369 --> 01:19.788
Hush, I'm trying to listen.

01:19.871 --> 01:23.041
Y'all don't know when to leave a room?

Damn, po-po's here.
We haven't even killed him yet.

Look, right now is not a good time.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.276
Sydney, how are you
just gonna run over here?

This is your daughter?

01:59.828 --> 02:00.745
Yes.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.206
And also yours.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.167
I have a daughter?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.169
See, I told you! I was right.

02:08.253 --> 02:13.424
I told you! Bennie Latrell Upshaw,
you are not the father.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.761
Yeah, I told you. I told you.
I told the kids. I told you.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.930
I definitely told you and I told you.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.349
I've been telling you
our whole relationship.

Monique, we spent
over an hour at the reunion

02:36.614 --> 02:41.035
arguing about the Brandy and Monica battle
and you couldn't tell me I had a daughter?

02:41.119 --> 02:44.664
It's a hard transition, bro.
And who picks Brandy?

How do you let her show up at my door?

And you almost got Bennie killed.

I wrote in my journal about us

02:57.552 --> 02:58.970

when it happened?

we slept together and you ghosted me.

became a Sherwin-Williams,

You could have at least given me a choice.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.538
Look, you didn't even know who you were.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.041
I didn't want to put this on you.

03:28.124 --> 03:32.253
I have so many questions.
I don't even know what to ask first.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.548
Ask her how she knows she's yours.

'Cause they got hurt, but that's okay.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.676
You know why? Because that's a scrape
compared to what you've done to mine.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.052
No, that ain't no scrape.

You got something
you want to say, like, "I'm sorry"?

Here's what I want to say…
This is all too much.

-Yeah, okay…
-What I'm saying is I need a drink.

that ages you.

that that little girl ain't his.

is sitting on your sofa.

is my mom's older sister.

She basically raised Bernard,
that's why he's her favorite.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.318
But after all this, he probably
will fall off and I could come up.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.821
Ha! You funny.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.823
You know I'm next in line.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.952
Trust your instincts.

Okay. So let me see
if I got everything straight.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.290
Well, your dad isn't.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.793
That was in the journal.

and he is your dad
but you have a different mother,

an illegal car, then she hit a white guy.

-Yeah.
-Stop lying, K-Ci and JoJo.

I ain't got time for this shit today.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.503

at my door looking for her daddy.

If it's not yours,
then what's the problem?

09:23.062 --> 09:26.899
Well, Regina just assumed
that the kid was mine from the jump.

09:26.983 --> 09:27.984
Of course she did.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.070

you know Ike did it.

Now look, this might be
seven years of prison bitterness talking,

09:35.324 --> 09:39.078
but you have done some questionable things
to those closest to you.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.582
I meant me.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.458
Yeah, that's why I'm standing over here.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.420
-Yeah, we cool now.
-[Bennie] Exactly.

No matter how many times
me and Regina talk,

09:50.006 --> 09:53.676
the first illegitimate kid that shows up
at the door, she's pointing fingers.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.178
Mmm. Technically, it's the second.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.432
Mmm… Technically,
I only need one mechanic.

No, you got to see it
from Regina's side too.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.319
Like, in prison
there was this guy named Raymond.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.279
He shanked me pretty good.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.115
Then a couple weeks later,
I seen him in the yard.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.575
And you beat his ass?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.285
No, he shanked me again.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.165
But that fifth time,
I remembered. [chuckles]

10:24.248 --> 10:28.002
And I knocked his teeth out
with a 25-pound dumbbell.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.379
Regina just trying
not to get shanked again.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.673
Enough with the Shawshank stories.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.594
Go find a grilled cheese
paper bag jail sandwich.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.679
[muttering indistinctly]

10:38.763 --> 10:41.182
-He always talking prison.
-Cooking up one right now.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.308
What the hell?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.810
[instrumental music playing]

10:46.896 --> 10:50.524
Oh, this chamomile is hitting.
I am finally calming down.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.194
-That makes one of us.
-Well, have some more.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.696
[sighs softly]

10:55.780 --> 10:57.573
[clears throat] I'm good.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.702
What? A little hair of the dog.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.038
You have to stop drinking for that.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.918
Mmm. This is $32 champagne.
The cork was actually made of cork.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.171
I still can't believe it.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.882
I've had a daughter
out there for nine years.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.300
[Lucretia] Allegedly.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.551
What'd you say?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.971
She said, "Allegedly."

11:21.055 --> 11:24.100
Look, what I'm saying is
we don't know of anything for sure.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.060
That's right. She is right, okay?

11:26.143 --> 11:28.979
So, none of us
need to think that we're a grandma

11:29.063 --> 11:30.731
until you take a paternity test.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.234
I'm not taking a paternity test.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.486
Oh, so you just dumb.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.489
Oh, no, no, no. He's not dumb.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.492
Oh, he's shook. Mm-hmm.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.538
Well, that's why this young, hot MILF

11:45.621 --> 11:48.916
is gonna take him
to the pharmacy to buy a test.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.461
Oh, Regina, you can't MILF yourself.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.090
Look, I appreciate
what y'all are coming from, okay?

11:56.173 --> 11:59.135
But I trust Monique.
If Monique says she's mine, she's mine.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.553
Oh, stop talking.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.264
You can't know for sure.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.892
Bernard, she could just be trying
to get some quick cash, okay?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.228
Everybody knows
they're trying to defund the po-po.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.648
My bedroom door is a curtain.
What money is she coming after?

12:12.732 --> 12:16.360
Look, this is my daughter,
my decision and my life.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.030
You know what?
You're right, sweetie. You are right.

12:20.865 --> 12:21.991
Give me that DNA.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.325
Ow!

12:23.409 --> 12:24.869
That's not even how that works.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.329
Look, I gotta start my shift.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.915
I took off for that little party
that didn't happen.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.043
Because I failed my test.

12:33.127 --> 12:37.631
If you take a paternity test,
you'll fail too. We are failures.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.800
Again, that's that Upshaw side.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.261
No one's taking a paternity test.

12:42.970 --> 12:43.804
[Regina scoffs]

12:44.764 --> 12:47.057
Someone's taking a paternity test.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.392
I don't know how.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.395
That beard hair slipped
right through my fingers.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.650
Hey, Bennie?
You working on your baby again?

12:56.734 --> 13:01.030
Okay. I wish my girl looked at me the same
way you look at that car. [chuckles]

13:01.113 --> 13:04.366
I'm lying. I just wish she looked at me.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.077
You know, Tony, this is
the best relationship I ever had.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.954
I treat her right.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.623
Yeah, she appreciate it.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.167
And she never accuses me
of having a side car.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.794
[chuckles and mutters]

13:14.877 --> 13:16.504
[Bernard] Hey, Tony, I got your package.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.297
Ooh. I hope that's my yarn.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.092
I mean, uh, my lady's yarn.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.804
-I order bullets.
-Yeah, okay.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.888
[vocalizes gunshot]

13:27.014 --> 13:29.266
Congratulations, Bernard!
We heard the news, man.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.312
Yeah, man.
Having children is a blessing from God.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.190
Till you have to
cut them in half. Solomon.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.025
Yeah, I'm still processing.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.069
Yeah. She sleeping through the night?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.570
I hope so. She's nine.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.824
You know, all day you deliver packages.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.117
This morning
someone dropped one off to you.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.078
[laughter]

13:49.161 --> 13:50.871
How long you been sitting on that one?

13:50.955 --> 13:54.041
Since I heard you
was the daddy and not me.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.461
Yeah, but I'm happy for you, man.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
You want me to teach you
how to be a good father?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.674
Don't you have to be a good father first?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.177
I thought we already done that
after you swung on me?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.388
Swung on? I connected.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.807
Yeah, and I let you. [sighs]

14:09.890 --> 14:13.143
Man, let's take a look at the little girl.
You got any pictures?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.729
-Yeah, man. Let me see my grandbaby, man.
-Yeah, man.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.147
I couldn't see how cute she was

14:17.231 --> 14:20.109
'cause I was too busy
thinking about how to fake a stroke.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.403
Uh, that's the back of her head.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.114
I only thought about
taking the picture as she was leaving.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.574
But you see that right there?

14:26.657 --> 14:29.910
-That's that Upshaw curl right there.
-Ah! Uh-huh! Okay!

14:30.494 --> 14:32.955
So y'all see it?
Can somebody tell my mama that?

14:33.038 --> 14:36.458
Her and Aunt Lucretia want me to
take a paternity test, but I told them no.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.253
That ain't gonna never end
'cause your mama's crazy

14:39.336 --> 14:42.298
and your Aunt Lucretia got
nothing else to do with her life.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.092
Oh, so, you want me
to take the test too, huh?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.052
No.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.930
Man, I want you to be your own man.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.807
I got you, son. I'm with you.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.893
Thanks, Pop. All right, fellas.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.686
-All right, Bernard.
-Bye, Bernard.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.316
-Oh, man, he's in a hard situation.
-Yeah.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.526
[chuckling] Yeah, I've been there.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.737
[exhales sharply]

15:05.654 --> 15:06.655
Really?

15:07.197 --> 15:08.657
No one's even gonna ask?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.994
Well, I'll tell you anyway.

15:12.661 --> 15:16.749
I was in a similar paternity situation,
but she didn't want to give me a test.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.294
She said she wanted a better life
for the kid and I can't blame her.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.837
Now, she says it's not mine,

15:21.921 --> 15:25.049
but I swear he's the Blackest Hungarian
I've ever seen.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.428
You know what? Tony's story gave me
time to think about something else.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.181
We should go to the casino.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.892
I'm trying to share with you, man.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.436
But, yeah, I am feeling lucky.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.271
If Regina gonna be on my ass,

15:39.355 --> 15:41.565
it might as well be
for something that I did.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.734
Okay, all right. Yeah.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.987
Let me tell my girl I'll be working late.
[laughs]

15:47.071 --> 15:48.280
I'm sitting bitch!

15:49.531 --> 15:51.283
[instrumental music playing]

15:51.367 --> 15:53.744
[sighs] I don't know about this, Cree.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.205
Just showing up at Monique's.
Is this right?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.958
Well, let's talk it over, Grandma.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.962
You know what? That's your last one.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.422
Get your finger out of my face, Mee-maw.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.470
Oh, shit, she's got a Ring.
Ugh! You think she heard us?

16:13.597 --> 16:14.723
Every word.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.226
Let me guess, you want a paternity test?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.978
Yes, we do.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.188
We just want to be certain.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.982
So, Bernard wants this too?

16:23.065 --> 16:24.441
Kind of.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.694
Then why isn't he here?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.946
Why are you so sure it's Bernard's?

16:29.738 --> 16:32.491
I was 17. How many men did I sleep with?

16:32.574 --> 16:34.994
[scoffs] Well, if you don't know…

16:35.077 --> 16:35.995
[scoffs]

16:36.078 --> 16:37.246
It was one.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.915
All right, look, Monique,

16:39.999 --> 16:43.293
we are not trying to
cause trouble in your life, okay?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.671
Come on. You dropped a bomb on me.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.589
On Bernard.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.800
Hey, I offered him one and he said no.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.802
But if you wanna go
against your son's wishes,

16:51.885 --> 16:55.973
getting all up in our business,
then please, by all means, come on in.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.477
[sighs]

17:01.353 --> 17:03.689
So, is this a shoes on or off situation?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.359
[instrumental music playing]

17:09.194 --> 17:11.155
Secondhand smoke and no clocks.

17:11.238 --> 17:14.074
That's just what I needed, fellas.
Let's lose some money.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.578
Yeah, I'm already going hard.
I got diet and regular.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.704
[laughter]

17:18.787 --> 17:20.706
Hey. New shooter.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.709
[cell phone ringing]

17:23.792 --> 17:25.044
[sighs]

17:25.127 --> 17:26.670
Oh, shit!

17:26.754 --> 17:28.380
My girl's trying to FaceTime me.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.590
I'll be right back.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.217
I just gotta run to the parking lot
and get under a car.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.846
I swear, I think
that woman is beating him.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.349
Come on.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.938
[blows sharply]
Regina needs a new attitude.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.193
Regina needs a new attitude.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.780
The Internet says we can compare

17:52.863 --> 17:55.491
Sydney's sample
to a sample from a grandparent.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.743
Well, I don't see one of those.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.412
Regina, get out your feelings.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.416
And as I recollect,
when you made Mama a grandma,

18:04.500 --> 18:05.876
she was younger than you.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.837
Well, what are you, ancestry-dot-bitch?

18:09.546 --> 18:12.382
You won't be the first grandma
I slapped the shit out of.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.594
Just give me the damn swab.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.848
And when Bennie gets home,
we'll do him too.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.310
It says the grandparent test
is 80% accurate.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.270
Eighty? Oh, no. Hell no.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.772
I'mma need 100%. All right?

18:26.855 --> 18:29.316
I mean, shit,
Thomas Jefferson made us all 80.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.905
The one that's 100% is Bernard's mouth,
and he ain't opening it.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.990
Other than to tell us
to mind our business.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.788
We've been talking.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.623
So?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.625
We'll be brief. Aaliyah?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.544
We want to know who our daddy is.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.463
Oh, this is not gonna end well.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.299
You know who your daddy is.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.676
Do we?

18:55.759 --> 18:57.261
Kids keep popping up,

18:57.344 --> 19:01.056
and for our peace of mind
we want access to our birth certificates.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.558
Okay.

19:03.058 --> 19:03.934
Lean in.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.062
Let me show you where
I keep them on the back of my hand!

19:07.146 --> 19:08.689
-I'm good.
-I want to see.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.607
No, you do not. Have a good evening.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.361
[sighs] I wish Bernard were that easy.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.072
He could be if you would step up.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.075
We had a whole conversation.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.870
Well, see, that's the problem right there.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.540
This isn't the time to be conversating.
You his mom.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.126
You need to lay down the law.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.131
Yeah, I… I will lay down the law.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.258
[whispers] Shh. Don't wake him.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.554
[whispers] Did he paint that accent wall?

19:40.637 --> 19:42.139
That's not in his lease.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
Lucretia. Can I introduce you
to some bigger fish?

19:46.685 --> 19:47.728
My bad.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.106
Just wish he'd ask permission first.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.442
I hate when family takes advantage.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.320
Let's just swab him before he wakes up.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.488
Good thing he sleeps with his mouth open.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.533
That's probably why
he has that raspy voice.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.596
-Give me that.
-Okay.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.514
[Bernard shifts]

20:25.140 --> 20:28.227
-Careful. Careful!
-I get it. I have a plan.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.813
[loudly] Bernard!

20:34.107 --> 20:35.609
What the hell are you doing?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.903
Did it. Done. Good night.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.655
DId y'all just swab me?

20:39.738 --> 20:41.740
No, I did. Your mother was useless.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.867
Monique told me what y'all did.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.703
What part of, "I don't need
a paternity test," do you not get?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.956
Bernard, you are still a child.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.791
No. No, I am not.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.209
Well, you are my child.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.671
You don't know what you're doing
not taking this test.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.756
Bennie took a test
when you were pregnant with me?

20:57.839 --> 20:58.924
Oh, hell no.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.426
But he was my boyfriend. We were together.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.930
Well, Monique and I were together
and I really cared about her.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.724
Look, I was wrong. Okay?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.351
I ghosted her back then.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.978
That doesn't make her a liar.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.397
She might have wanted to tell me.

21:14.189 --> 21:17.109
Is that why you made us
get a new phone number?

21:17.192 --> 21:19.486
You owe me a $45 change fee.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.907
I missed nine years.
I'm not missing another day.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.620
The way Bennie trusted you,
I trust Monique.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.331
Shit. I trust Monique
more than I trust Bennie.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.334
Are you sure?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.962
Yes, 100%.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.090
I mean, for real, for real? Sure, sure?

21:40.173 --> 21:41.008
Mom.

21:42.009 --> 21:42.926
-Okay.
-[sighs softly]

21:45.178 --> 21:46.263
I get it.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.099
It's not about me.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.815
[smacks lips] As long as you're sure
and as long as you're good.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.484
I'd be better if I can get back to sleep.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.280
[Bernard sighs]

22:03.363 --> 22:05.365
Are y'all crazy? Give me that swab.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.868
Just… Let's just leave it.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.123
Fine.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.002
But I'll be back
to talk about that accent wall.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.671
[instrumental music playing]

22:20.839 --> 22:22.090
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.384
What you writing?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.137
I'm writing a list of names
that Sydney can call me

22:27.220 --> 22:29.723
-that don't make me want to drink bleach.
-[chuckles]

22:29.806 --> 22:32.059
Best one I have is Ree-Ree.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.145
You've been trying to
get that one going since high school.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.022
Well, this is my chance.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.399
I always wanted to be Pappy. [chuckles]

22:39.483 --> 22:41.985
[scoffs] Yeah, I can see you as Pappy.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.072
Why do you smell like a casino?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.407
'Cause I've been to the casino.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.746
No surprise there.
Figured you would act out from earlier.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.581
So how much did you lose?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.833
Nothing. I didn't gamble.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.462
Yeah, right. What, you going to close
your eyes at the strip club too?

23:00.545 --> 23:03.965
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
That's why I got Duck. Duck, tell 'em.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.133
He ain't gamble.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.470
-Beat it, Duck.
-But you drove.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.554
Beat it, Duck.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.474
I guess we hoofing it, Tony.
How you doing, Regina?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.433
[door closes]

23:15.477 --> 23:18.188
Okay. What the hell are we right now?

23:18.271 --> 23:22.234
Sex at night? We fight in the morning?
[exhales]

23:22.317 --> 23:25.695
I think you got more side kids.
You walking out. [scoffs]

23:26.822 --> 23:28.907
God, how did we get here?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.075
I don't know.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.662
But I don't like it.
I was pissed the way you looked at me

23:33.745 --> 23:35.622
after we had that talk the other night,

23:35.705 --> 23:37.833
but I figured if I rolled the dice,

23:37.916 --> 23:40.544
I'd just be doing
the same thing I always do.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.631
I don't want to go back in that basement.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.218
I don't want you back in the basement.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.889
I liked last night.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.268
You did.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.980
I broke you off good
when I pulled your leg up--

24:00.063 --> 24:02.649
I was talking about
our emotional connection, jackass.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.650
Oh, yeah.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
But you're not wrong.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.780
So, how do we not do this?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.992
Just don't do it.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.662
-That's my Ree-Ree.
-[chuckles]

24:17.164 --> 24:20.041
That's my man. Knowing me.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.545
Man.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.299
I can't believe Bernard got a kid.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.843
I'm told I have to believe it.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.181
-Wait a minute.
-What?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.307
Be honest.

24:35.390 --> 24:40.020
Is him being gay easier for you
now that he's got a baby mama?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.980
Not if it's wrong for feeling it.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.065
I like that he's a father.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.193
Who knows if he'll find a good dude

24:46.276 --> 24:48.778
and have to pay
some white lady to have their baby.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.031
Maybe it's his only shot.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.534
You keep surprising me. [chuckles]

24:54.618 --> 24:58.413
You surprised me when you told me
you was pregnant with Bernard.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.331
[chuckles]

24:59.414 --> 25:01.917
Why did you have to
break the news at the Hardee's?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.461
I was on a shift break.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.713
[both laughing]

25:06.796 --> 25:08.965
I remember the look on your face.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.259
That's 'cause you
charged me for them fries.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.763
-We weren't nothing but 16.
-Mmm.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.766
-Those kids have come a long way.
-Yeah.

25:18.391 --> 25:19.351
Damn long way.

25:19.434 --> 25:22.729
Their baby has a baby.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.981
And she's cute too. I love her.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.650
Oh. Hell yeah, she's cute.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.404
Word on the street is her Ree-Ree is fine.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.240
Yeah, and the street's ain't lying.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.867
I love you, baby.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.536
I love you too.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.292
Hey, Regina, babe.
Just, uh, finishing up here at the shop.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.503
Be home soon.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.588
Yeah, I can bring milk.

25:49.881 --> 25:50.882
Love you, babe.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.761
Sorry about that.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.556
So, where were we?

25:59.432 --> 26:02.435
