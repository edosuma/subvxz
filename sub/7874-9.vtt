00:33.114 --> 00:35.788
Ah, the lighting of the town
Christmas tree.

00:35.789 --> 00:37.834
Can you think of anything
more American?

00:37.835 --> 00:39.659
- An American flag?
- Or...

00:39.660 --> 00:42.932
Or, an American flag
with Christmas trees for stars.

00:42.933 --> 00:44.474
Ooh, that would make a good cake.

00:44.475 --> 00:46.571
Note to self : I like cake.

00:46.576 --> 00:50.150
Well, isn't that cute.
Roger's making a snow angel.

00:50.154 --> 00:52.392
A facedown snow angel...

00:52.392 --> 00:55.171
in a pile of angel vomit.

00:55.173 --> 00:57.727
He's passed out, Mom. He's been
binge drinking since Thanksgiving.

00:57.729 --> 00:59.760
Get up, Roger.
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:59.765 --> 01:04.882
Another year on this planet I have...
I haven't accomplished squat.

01:05.045 --> 01:07.231
Can't even drink myself to death.

01:07.265 --> 01:11.062
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
You've only been here four years.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.921
- Try 60.
- You've been here 60 years?

01:13.928 --> 01:17.971
Yeah, I crashed in Roswell in '47.
Thanks for finally asking.

01:17.977 --> 01:21.402
Six decades of dragging my ass
around this blue marble

01:21.407 --> 01:23.003
and what do I have to show for it?

01:23.005 --> 01:23.993
Nothing!

01:23.997 --> 01:27.141
Laugh it up, Ma.
You were right, I'm a loser.

01:28.025 --> 01:29.901
Don't judge me, fatty.

01:30.165 --> 01:31.923
Damn it, Roger, get a hold of yourself.

01:31.928 --> 01:33.640
You're not going to spoil my Christmas.

01:33.668 --> 01:37.170
Can I have everyone's attention?
I've just been handed this injunction.

01:37.188 --> 01:39.142
Which means we have to cancel this function.

01:39.146 --> 01:42.022
- You're rhyming again.
- I know. I hear it. I'm trying not to.

01:42.027 --> 01:44.501
It says here that
the square is public land

01:44.507 --> 01:48.410
and therefore isn't an appropriate place
for religious icons.

01:54.926 --> 01:55.640
What?!

01:55.648 --> 01:58.151
We're going to let the
secularist non-believers

01:58.155 --> 02:00.571
dictate how we celebrate Jesus' birthday?!

02:00.576 --> 02:03.733
Actually, I kinda see their point.
I mean, if you're not Christian,

02:03.735 --> 02:06.293
all this Christmas stuff might
make you feel a little uncomfortable.

02:06.295 --> 02:08.113
Oh, I cannot wait for the Rapture.

02:08.115 --> 02:09.431
You're going to be left behind,

02:09.487 --> 02:10.721
you're going to be left behind,

02:10.728 --> 02:12.650
you're going to be left behind,
you're going...

02:12.657 --> 02:15.152
Stan. Post-Rapture,

02:15.156 --> 02:17.190
feel free to use our pool.

02:17.377 --> 02:19.643
You know, if it isn't boiling.

02:19.646 --> 02:22.653
Francine, I'm going to completely
lose my Christmas cheer,

02:22.655 --> 02:25.540
if I don't get some place where
they understand this holiday pronto.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.061
We can stop by church.

02:27.066 --> 02:28.740
I don't need to be bored, Francine.

02:28.745 --> 02:31.191
I need to be reminded of what
Christmas is all about.

02:31.575 --> 02:32.840
To the shopping mall.

02:35.118 --> 02:36.633
Ah, this is more like it.

02:36.637 --> 02:40.391
Two teenagers sitting on an old
man's lap as a midget snaps a picture.

02:40.395 --> 02:43.180
If that doesn't commemorate
our Savior's birth, I don't know what does.

02:43.238 --> 02:46.483
This year Santa smelled like whiskey,
and the midget smelled like pot.

02:46.485 --> 02:48.543
I know. When did they change it up?

02:48.548 --> 02:50.911
Stan, did your remember
to get a gift for Roger?

02:50.915 --> 02:52.953
Roger? He's not a Christian.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.151
You think he cares that 2,000 years ago
our Lord and Savior was born in a mangler?

02:57.156 --> 02:59.030
Uh, I think you mean "manger."

02:59.036 --> 03:00.873
No, no, honey, you're
thinking of "manager."

03:00.878 --> 03:03.182
Just get him something, Dad.
He's so depressed.

03:03.425 --> 03:04.321
Fine.

03:06.957 --> 03:09.533
- One of your items, please.
- How about this cassette?

03:11.288 --> 03:14.222
- Is it 99 cents?
- It's $1.07 with tax.

03:14.326 --> 03:17.112
- You ever think about changing the sign?
- It's not really up to me.

03:17.628 --> 03:19.073
Well, Merry Christmas.

03:19.126 --> 03:20.360
Happy holidays.

03:21.126 --> 03:24.041
I, uh, said Merry Christmas.

03:24.075 --> 03:26.293
- Happy holidays.
- Just say Merry Christmas.

03:26.296 --> 03:28.141
Management doesn't
want us saying that.

03:28.146 --> 03:29.120
Just say it!

03:31.596 --> 03:33.013
Uh, I had a gun.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.331
Happy holidays.

03:39.268 --> 03:40.990
I used to love Christmas.

03:41.027 --> 03:44.681
But now the Liberals have decided
that Christmas is offensive.

03:44.785 --> 03:46.873
Someone's feelings could get hurt.

03:46.907 --> 03:48.451
You know who's to blame for this?

03:48.536 --> 03:49.433
Well, do you?

03:49.517 --> 03:52.350
<i>- Jane Fonda.
- Jane Fonda.</i>

03:52.508 --> 03:54.982
Today's Liberals are
yesterday's hippies.

03:55.005 --> 03:58.791
And those hippies would have worn
themselves out dancing in the mud, but no,

03:58.797 --> 04:01.243
she had to revitalize
their dying movement

04:01.248 --> 04:03.672
by going to North Vietnam
and humanizing the enemy.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.633
I'm Hanoi Jane.
Don't kill Communists.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.083
Look at my boobies.

04:08.158 --> 04:10.083
That was the beginning of the end.

04:11.558 --> 04:14.602
Oh, here we go, Stan. Christmas carolers.

04:14.866 --> 04:18.541
- Welcome ye gentle carolers.
- Oh, we're not here to sing.

04:18.596 --> 04:21.433
We're just here to warn people
about the Holiday Rapist.

04:21.487 --> 04:22.980
You mean the Christmas Rapist.

04:23.027 --> 04:25.293
The guy who strikes every year
on Christmas.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.561
Yeah, they've asked us to
call him the Holiday Rapist.

04:27.598 --> 04:29.403
No, he's the Christmas Rapist.

04:29.408 --> 04:32.003
He rapes on Christmas.
Is nothing sacred?

04:33.235 --> 04:34.730
Christmas is dead.

04:35.095 --> 04:36.430
What are you doing?!

04:38.147 --> 04:40.611
If I can't say it, I'm not going
to celebrate it.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.890
Daddy's breaking all the presents
Chinese kids made for me.

04:45.977 --> 04:49.661
Stan Smith, is this your idea
of a good Christmas?

04:49.717 --> 04:53.272
Destroying your children's presents
and terrifying Roger?

04:53.897 --> 04:55.261
Is it over?

04:55.598 --> 04:58.323
If anyone's ruined Christmas, it's you.

04:58.435 --> 05:01.572
And you can think about that while
you're sleeping on the couch.

05:01.577 --> 05:03.821
On the couch?
But the window's broken,

05:03.848 --> 05:05.542
and the Christmas Rapist is on the loose.

05:05.595 --> 05:07.043
<i>Holiday Rapist.</i>

05:13.288 --> 05:16.270
Arise and awaken, Stan Smith.

05:16.408 --> 05:17.663
Holiday Rapist!

05:17.978 --> 05:19.341
I mean Christmas Rapist!

05:19.368 --> 05:22.460
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

05:22.465 --> 05:24.313
Why... why are you here?

05:24.347 --> 05:27.922
Because you've forgotten the
true meaning of Christmas.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.782
Take my sleeve, Stan.

05:33.348 --> 05:34.960
This is where I grew up.

05:35.017 --> 05:36.122
Yes, Stan.

05:38.908 --> 05:41.143
And that happy little boy is you.

05:41.616 --> 05:44.240
'Tis Christmas morn, 1970.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.720
President Nixon is in the White House,

05:46.878 --> 05:50.641
The Partridge Family top-eth the charts
with "I think I Love You" ******

05:50.858 --> 05:54.371
and Jane Fonda is filming
her Oscar-winning role in Klute.

05:55.125 --> 05:58.992
Ah, look at you...
Basking in the love of your family.

05:58.995 --> 06:02.421
You knew what Christmas was
about back then, didn't you, Stan?

06:03.078 --> 06:04.273
Stan?

06:04.988 --> 06:07.540
What? Hey, no, no, no.
Dude, where you going?

06:07.545 --> 06:09.142
You can't run away.

06:09.487 --> 06:12.922
Great. My first gig as Christmas Past
and I tank it.

06:12.925 --> 06:16.330
Couldn't be happy with just being the
Tooth Fairy. No, no, it's too steady.

06:16.337 --> 06:18.011
Live risky, reach for the stars.

06:18.017 --> 06:21.541
Well, that's not stardust on
your hands, Michelle, it's failure,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.110
and it don't wash off.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.940
Should have just married Chad.

06:24.946 --> 06:27.850
There's only one way to save Christmas.

06:28.066 --> 06:30.513
Kill Jane Fonda.

06:40.865 --> 06:42.280
Gotcha.

06:42.348 --> 06:44.572
Hey suit guy,
totally nude nudes.

06:44.588 --> 06:47.300
No time, friend.
I've got to kill Jane Fonda

06:47.306 --> 06:50.121
before she goes to Vietnam
and ruins Christmas.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.312
All right, Miss Fonda...

06:57.416 --> 06:58.660
action.

07:02.398 --> 07:04.032
- Gross.
- Cut.

07:04.086 --> 07:06.503
Beautiful, Jane. That fork thing...

07:06.505 --> 07:08.182
- genius.
- Thanks.

07:08.187 --> 07:10.890
I figured, hey, share the experience.

07:10.895 --> 07:12.920
Remove any notion of ownership.
I mean...

07:12.924 --> 07:16.853
- who's really the pet here, right?
- Oh, you are so dead.

07:23.122 --> 07:25.711
- What the hell?!
- You have to help me.

07:25.803 --> 07:27.377
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past

07:27.379 --> 07:30.480
and I took your husband back
to 1970 and he bolted on me.

07:30.488 --> 07:32.912
You lost my husband in the past?

07:32.916 --> 07:36.953
Look, if a mom takes a kid to the mall
and loses the kid, do you blame the mom?

07:37.885 --> 07:39.843
No, no, you don't, no.

07:39.846 --> 07:43.003
- Anyway, can you help me find him?
- I don't understand.

07:43.006 --> 07:44.693
Why would Stan run away?

07:44.697 --> 07:48.191
Beats me. One minute I'm talking
about President Nixon and Jane Fonda,

07:48.196 --> 07:49.690
the next minute he's gone.

07:51.266 --> 07:54.702
I think I know where he went.
Be right with you.

07:56.536 --> 07:58.540
Um, we're kind of in a hurry.

07:58.545 --> 08:02.291
I'm not going back to that filthy
decade without some Purell.

08:07.505 --> 08:10.023
Come on, Don, I'm just an actress.

08:10.025 --> 08:13.363
Jane, you have the power
to be so much more than that.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.073
Donald Sutherland.

08:15.145 --> 08:17.443
You're destined to be a great woman.

08:17.448 --> 08:20.163
You know, you should
get involved in politics.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.132
- I don't know.
- Let's talk about this later

08:23.136 --> 08:26.280
over drinks?
Maybe at my place?

08:26.675 --> 08:28.291
I got it all wrong.

08:28.295 --> 08:31.983
Sutherland pushed her into politics.
He's the one I have to kill.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.221
- What did you say?
- Um...

08:34.227 --> 08:36.919
Are you here to give Jane her massage?

08:36.927 --> 08:39.159
Yes. Yes, that seems pretty fun.

08:40.908 --> 08:44.612
All right, Miss Fonda, lie down.
You can finish that cat food later.

08:50.845 --> 08:52.142
You on the list?

08:52.156 --> 08:54.710
Uh, yeah, Jack Nichol...
Oh, I always mix them up.

08:54.716 --> 08:56.941
Not the golfer, the guy
in About Schmidt.

08:56.947 --> 09:00.373
You know, he was the one in the hot tub
with the big lady from Delores Claiborne.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.103
Kathy Bates. I am Kathy Bates.

09:02.107 --> 09:03.351
Back of the line.

09:13.006 --> 09:14.440
Ooh, cold, cold.

09:14.446 --> 09:15.901
But flattering.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.611
So did you get that part on Ryan's Hope?

09:32.617 --> 09:34.071
No, they really liked me,

09:34.086 --> 09:37.352
but they're going with someone a
little more flesh-colored with a nose.

09:37.358 --> 09:38.730
Give it up, loser.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.341
I'm not a loser!

09:45.696 --> 09:47.840
Disco's Greatest Hits.

09:47.855 --> 09:52.043
Best songs from 1974 to 1980?

09:52.427 --> 09:55.691
This tape is from the future.
But that's impossible.

09:55.698 --> 09:58.491
On the other hand, I'm a
spaceman working at Elaine's

09:58.497 --> 10:00.501
so maybe I should open
my mind a bit.

10:03.418 --> 10:05.180
Have you seen Donald Sutherland?

10:05.448 --> 10:08.050
You might want to check
between Fay Dunaway's legs.

10:08.057 --> 10:09.080
Hold it now.

10:09.088 --> 10:11.402
That smells like a marijuana cigarette.

10:11.405 --> 10:13.971
It makes me high like one, too.
Maybe that's what it is.

10:14.638 --> 10:16.800
What's your name, funny guy?

10:16.836 --> 10:18.643
Marty, Marty Scorsese.

10:18.648 --> 10:20.883
Martin Scorsese? Wow.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.190
Oh, you're amazing. I love your work.

10:23.195 --> 10:25.962
You saw my six minute film
about a guy shaving?

10:26.607 --> 10:30.003
Let's just say the world has yet
to recognize your genius.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.860
But you're never going to win
an Oscar hopped up on the dope.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.952
You know what, man, you're right.

10:41.325 --> 10:44.190
I'm proud of you.
Come on, bring it in.

10:45.516 --> 10:47.251
Your eyebrows tickle.

10:50.807 --> 10:53.862
Oh, okay, like you've never
overshot a freeway exit.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.751
Oh, look how cute.

11:04.445 --> 11:07.673
You know, you should
get involved in politics.

11:07.787 --> 11:11.642
Let's talk about it over drinks.
Maybe at my place?

11:12.267 --> 11:14.383
Let's talk about it over your brains.

11:14.386 --> 11:16.010
Maybe all over the place?

11:16.506 --> 11:17.782
Delightful.

11:21.196 --> 11:23.570
Stan, you can't kill Jane Fonda.

11:23.577 --> 11:25.831
Don't worry, Sutherland's my new target.

11:25.836 --> 11:29.122
That lanky Canadian, Keifer-spawning
bastard's going down.

11:29.128 --> 11:31.120
No, anything you do here in the past

11:31.125 --> 11:33.512
could have drastic consequences
in the future.

11:33.525 --> 11:37.271
Well, too bad. I'm here to save
Christmas and you can't stop me.

11:37.278 --> 11:39.141
Wrong. We're going home.

11:39.147 --> 11:40.690
<i>Oh, man!</i>

11:42.537 --> 11:44.870
What the hell happened to our house?

11:44.877 --> 11:46.900
Hey, I didn't screw up, okay?

11:46.908 --> 11:49.292
This is the right year and
we're in the right place.

11:49.298 --> 11:51.373
But everything's different.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.581
Steve, Hayley?

11:56.115 --> 11:57.321
Run!

12:02.916 --> 12:04.693
- What the...?
- Look out!

12:06.857 --> 12:09.421
What a Soviet tank doing in America?

12:09.426 --> 12:11.100
I'll tell you what it's doing here.

12:11.107 --> 12:14.082
You changed something in
the past that affected the future.

12:14.087 --> 12:17.751
Stan Smith, you destroyed America.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.271
Francine!

12:21.278 --> 12:23.791
What, I've had to pee since the '70s.

12:29.255 --> 12:31.820
How could I have destroyed America?

12:31.826 --> 12:33.421
I don't know if I'd said this yet,

12:33.427 --> 12:37.373
but when something in the past
gets changed, it affects the future!

12:37.378 --> 12:40.591
Think, Stan, what did you do
when you were back in 1970?

12:40.647 --> 12:44.471
Nothing. I went to the set of Klute,
I gave Jane Fonda a massage...

12:44.477 --> 12:46.722
- What?!
- Honey, it was 1970.

12:46.725 --> 12:50.071
- It was before I knew you.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

12:50.078 --> 12:52.523
Uh! No, it wasn't any of that, no.

12:52.528 --> 12:56.210
Uh, I met Martin Scorcese,
got him off drugs.

12:57.835 --> 13:01.293
Getting Scorcese of drugs means
he never did all the cocaine

13:01.295 --> 13:03.402
that fueled him to make Taxi Driver,

13:03.408 --> 13:05.940
<i>which means he never cast Jody Foster,</i>

13:05.947 --> 13:08.842
<i>which means John Hinckley
never obsessed over her</i>

13:08.846 --> 13:12.651
<i>and he never tried to impress her
by shooting President Reagan.</i>

13:12.657 --> 13:17.113
<i>Which means Reagan was never empowered
by surviving an assassination attempt.</i>

13:17.116 --> 13:19.611
He must have lost to Mondale in '84.

13:19.615 --> 13:20.540
Bingo.

13:20.548 --> 13:24.131
47 days into his presidency,
Mondale handed complete control

13:24.136 --> 13:28.462
- of the U.S. over to the Soviet Union.
- I guess that explains the statue.

13:30.118 --> 13:33.491
- Stan, we have to make this right.
- I'm way ahead of you.

13:33.495 --> 13:35.841
There's only one way to save America.

13:35.845 --> 13:39.322
I have to go back in time
and make Taxi Driver.

13:39.328 --> 13:42.331
- What?! Stan, that's crazy.
- No, he's right.

13:42.336 --> 13:44.660
If that movie doesn't get made in 1974,

13:44.668 --> 13:46.871
you'll end up commies
and I'll be out of a job.

13:46.877 --> 13:48.802
Let's go! Hyah! Hyah!

13:48.806 --> 13:52.151
- Time-travel me!
- Yeah, that's not how it works.

13:55.498 --> 13:58.850
Okay, no more slip-ups.
We're just here to make a movie.

13:58.858 --> 14:02.711
Let's try not to leave
our dirty fingerprints all over 1974.

14:16.206 --> 14:19.250
<i>Mr. Epstein, Clive Davis
is here to see you.</i>

14:28.225 --> 14:31.451
- What do you think, Clive?
- Fun...ky!

14:31.455 --> 14:34.692
This is going to be even bigger than
the six other hits you've given me.

14:34.695 --> 14:38.072
You've single-handedly created
the disco revolution.

14:38.076 --> 14:40.962
- It's what I do, baby.
- I mean, it's uncanny.

14:40.977 --> 14:44.540
It's like you've reached into the
future to bring back hit after hit.

14:46.118 --> 14:49.451
Congratulations, you just made
your first million.

14:55.448 --> 14:58.540
I'm a winner, Ma! Look at me now!

14:59.276 --> 15:01.303
Now don't look for a second.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.111
You can look again, Ma!

15:12.188 --> 15:13.733
You talkin' to me?

15:13.817 --> 15:15.733
You talkin' to me?

15:15.737 --> 15:16.810
Cut!

15:17.518 --> 15:21.281
- Come on, man. What's wrong now?
- Why were you talking to the mirror?

15:21.296 --> 15:25.471
Because Travis is such a loner,
he's desperate for any interaction,

15:25.475 --> 15:28.151
even if it's just with his own reflection.

15:28.155 --> 15:29.972
Didn't look like you were talking
to your reflection.

15:29.977 --> 15:31.562
It looked like you were talking
to the mirror.

15:31.568 --> 15:34.483
Like I was having a conversation
with the actual mirror?

15:34.488 --> 15:36.951
- Yeah.
- Not the person in the mirror?

15:36.955 --> 15:39.223
No. Now let's do it again.
And this time...

15:39.226 --> 15:40.873
You're an idiot. I quit.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.570
Stan, you can't let him quit.
The movie's got to be the same.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.061
No, it doesn't. Jody Foster's
the one Hinckley falls for, right?

15:48.066 --> 15:50.473
So Robert DeZero wants to quit? Fine.

15:50.476 --> 15:53.490
Now I can make this movie with
the actor I wanted from the start.

15:58.997 --> 16:00.952
Okay, that's Hinckley.

16:11.598 --> 16:13.590
Howdy, pilgrim.

16:22.408 --> 16:24.620
Let's go home, Iris.

16:33.755 --> 16:37.470
La lengua de la cinema es universal.

16:38.158 --> 16:41.473
Hey, excuse me.
How did you like the movie?

16:41.816 --> 16:45.432
But how about that Jody Foster?
Pretty hot, huh?

16:45.436 --> 16:49.762
I bet you have to do something really
special to impress a girl like that.

16:49.778 --> 16:52.332
That's disgusting. She's 12!

16:52.967 --> 16:55.091
Yeah, a hard 12!

16:55.098 --> 16:57.863
Grass on the field!
Go shoot the President!

16:57.865 --> 17:00.750
Well, that's it.
Hinckley hated it. We failed.

17:00.756 --> 17:03.731
Good-bye, America.
Good-bye, Christmas.

17:03.737 --> 17:06.030
Wait, no. No, no, no, no,
good-bye Christmas.

17:06.035 --> 17:08.553
I can't go back to the Tooth
Fairy Guild.

17:08.755 --> 17:12.930
I burned that bridge when I left a little
going-away present on my bosses' desk...

17:12.935 --> 17:15.762
Did you know DNA is in poo?
'Cause I sure didn't.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.203
Come on. Come on.
We can still fix this.

17:21.198 --> 17:23.332
- Where are we?
- Washington, D.C.,

17:23.337 --> 17:26.991
- March 30th, 1981.
- Hey, that's the Secret Service.

17:27.318 --> 17:31.033
- President Reagan's inside.
- Reagan? He's my hero.

17:31.037 --> 17:34.382
Wait. This is the Hilton.
This is where Hinckley shot Reagan.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.280
Yeah, this is where Hinckley used to shoot
Reagan, but not anymore, remember?

17:38.288 --> 17:41.741
Listen, Stan, I know you love Reagan,
but you screwed things up.

17:41.747 --> 17:45.153
You have to make them right.
You have to shoot the President.

17:48.847 --> 17:52.650
- Great record-release party, Roger.
- The greatest, baby.

17:54.037 --> 17:55.882
We did it!

17:56.435 --> 17:57.513
Hello?

17:57.715 --> 17:59.590
Larry!

17:59.597 --> 18:01.763
Hey, hold on.
I'm going to put you on speaker.

18:01.768 --> 18:04.830
<i>- Everyone, it's Larry.
- Larry!</i>

18:04.838 --> 18:07.323
Hear that? They love you, Lar,
and so do I.

18:07.327 --> 18:09.931
<i>- How'd the record do?
- Take me off speaker, Roger.</i>

18:09.935 --> 18:12.753
No, these are my friends.
How many albums did we sell?

18:12.755 --> 18:16.123
<i>- Give me the number, you crazy Jew.
- Uh, 90.</i>

18:16.127 --> 18:18.050
90 million!

18:18.055 --> 18:20.583
<i>No, 90. 90 records.</i>

18:20.586 --> 18:22.901
<i>Disco's dead, you're broke.</i>

18:23.967 --> 18:26.253
What the hell are you
talking about, Larry?

18:27.028 --> 18:29.681
Hey, hey, don't leave.
The party's not over.

18:29.765 --> 18:31.492
What about my investments?

18:31.507 --> 18:33.282
What about all my racehorses?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.712
I thought you were feeding them.

18:36.107 --> 18:38.263
My God, I'm ruined!

18:38.266 --> 18:40.412
Ruined!

18:46.096 --> 18:50.102
There's no way I'm shooting Reagan, so
we might as well start learning Russian.

18:50.107 --> 18:52.733
I wonder how you say,
"Hold the door" in Russian?

18:52.736 --> 18:55.153
I'm probably going to miss
a lot of elevators at first.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.763
But, Stan, if the Soviets
control the U.S.,

18:57.765 --> 18:59.600
there really won't be a Christmas.

18:59.608 --> 19:02.652
No decorations, no pageants, no Santa.

19:02.657 --> 19:04.082
I'll miss all that,

19:04.087 --> 19:06.700
but at least I'll still have you
and the kids.

19:06.715 --> 19:07.901
What kids?

19:07.905 --> 19:11.040
If you don't fix this, you and Francine
might never meet.

19:11.056 --> 19:13.050
Your kids might never be born.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.181
The future depends on what you do now.

19:22.115 --> 19:25.843
- It's go time.
- Are you sure you can do this?

19:25.846 --> 19:28.490
Francine, I came back here
to save Christmas.

19:28.498 --> 19:32.310
But the most important part of
Christmas is you and the kids.

19:34.847 --> 19:37.073
Now remember, you only need to wing him.

19:37.075 --> 19:40.981
Wow, thank you. Geez!
That, that would have been ugly.

19:43.237 --> 19:46.302
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

19:52.006 --> 19:53.330
Did it work?

19:55.155 --> 19:57.691
No tanks, no Russian troops.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.072
- Hey, boy, what day is this?
- Why, it's Christmas, sir.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.822
That's wonderful!
Now get the hell off my lawn.

20:06.018 --> 20:08.080
We did it, Francine.

20:10.936 --> 20:14.821
- We're having Christmas after all!
- You fixed everything!

20:15.058 --> 20:17.132
He sure did.

20:17.198 --> 20:19.893
This one is for you,
but I think it's broken.

20:19.895 --> 20:23.421
That's okay, beautiful.
I already have everything I want.

20:24.148 --> 20:28.253
- Merry Christmas, Roger.
- I got your Christmas right here.

20:28.738 --> 20:31.761
That's, that's where my genitals are.

20:31.766 --> 20:34.292
I created disco, you know?

20:34.297 --> 20:37.530
Yeah, yeah, and you lost it all and
Clive Davis hogged your eight ball.

20:37.547 --> 20:41.012
We've heard it a million times.
Get over it already!

20:41.017 --> 20:42.543
Yeah, you're right.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.140
Who got me what?

20:45.075 --> 20:46.222
Stan.

20:46.858 --> 20:49.471
I made it to the mall in time
last night so,

20:49.475 --> 20:52.442
I got you a little something,
you know, for saving my butt.

20:54.278 --> 20:57.072
Wow, a brand-new Glock!

20:57.076 --> 20:59.031
Wait. How'd you buy this last night?

20:59.046 --> 21:01.280
There's a seven-day waiting period :
the Brady Bill.

21:01.286 --> 21:02.732
Oh, you only shot Reagan.

21:02.736 --> 21:05.301
No, there is no Brady Bill.
You can get a gun like that.

21:05.318 --> 21:08.180
This is the best Christmas ever.
