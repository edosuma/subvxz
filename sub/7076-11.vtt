I was a fool to think I wasn't
destined for a life of this.

17:11.373 --> 17:12.656
I mean, look around.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.593
Can you even imagine what kind
of wedding I could throw

17:15.594 --> 17:17.494
if I actually gave a crap?

17:17.496 --> 17:20.498
- No offense.
- Knock it off.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.717
Being good at weddings doesn't
make you good at marriage.

17:22.718 --> 17:23.851
Exactly.

17:23.852 --> 17:25.102
People can make all sorts
of promises,

17:25.103 --> 17:26.721
but they never stick it out.

17:26.722 --> 17:28.890
It's not something you
just stick out, man, all right?

17:28.891 --> 17:30.107
It's a risk
that you take together.

17:30.108 --> 17:32.009
And you don't
just promise it once.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.811
You got to promise it
every day.

17:33.812 --> 17:35.396
Yes, but the person you're
making promises to

17:35.397 --> 17:37.815
is going to change.
You have to accept that.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.818
I do.
But do you promise to be patient

17:40.819 --> 17:43.354
when that person's stereo
business takes a little while

17:43.355 --> 17:45.356
- to get off the ground.
- I do, but...

17:45.357 --> 17:47.308
Do you accept that ten years
is more than a little while

17:47.309 --> 17:48.793
and that iPods
aren't going away,

17:48.794 --> 17:52.830
and maybe it's time to let
somebody else take the lead?

17:52.831 --> 17:53.965
I do.

17:53.966 --> 17:56.250
You do?

17:56.251 --> 17:59.587
Yes, baby, I swear I do.

17:59.588 --> 18:01.556
Then I promise I will do
whatever it takes

18:01.557 --> 18:03.307
to make this work forever.

18:03.308 --> 18:05.343
Oh!

18:05.344 --> 18:07.711
Well, in that case,
let's rehearse this bad boy.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.013
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually,

18:09.014 --> 18:10.431
you pretty much just married
each other.

18:10.432 --> 18:12.233
If you let me pronounce you
man and wife,

18:12.234 --> 18:13.684
you can kiss the bride

18:13.685 --> 18:15.987
and you can save like, um,
70 bucks.

18:15.988 --> 18:17.555
- What do you say, baby?
- Mmm.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.340
Mm-hmm.
[Applause]

18:19.341 --> 18:21.526
Done and done.
Husband and wife.

18:21.527 --> 18:23.611
- [Giggles]
- Now how about it?

18:23.612 --> 18:27.698
Let's party!
[Cheering, applause]

18:27.699 --> 18:29.951
Both: Lame.

18:29.952 --> 18:33.838
[Upbeat music]

18:33.839 --> 18:35.573
[Clattering]

18:41.346 --> 18:44.048
[Monkey squeaks]

18:47.586 --> 18:48.586
Abed.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.720
Abed! Abed!

18:49.721 --> 18:51.556
We're weird.
We need to be weird.

18:51.557 --> 18:53.107
You want to see something
weird? Check out this dance.

18:53.108 --> 18:54.775
Uh, what did you call this?
The "Lindbergh lean"?

18:54.776 --> 18:56.260
What'll they think of next?

19:00.315 --> 19:02.650
Inspector spacetime...

19:02.651 --> 19:04.952
Ohh, thank the cosmic engineer
I found you.

19:04.953 --> 19:06.404
Troy, this is hardly the time.

19:06.405 --> 19:08.772
Or is it hardly
the space?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.074
Okay, I see
what you did there.

19:10.075 --> 19:11.459
But now I have to get back
to my Lindbergh lean

19:11.460 --> 19:13.077
with, uh... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

19:13.078 --> 19:15.413
Inspector...
What sort of creature

19:15.414 --> 19:19.283
would do a dance
called the Lindbergh lean?

19:19.284 --> 19:21.385
- Blorgons?
- [Whispers] Blorgons.

19:21.386 --> 19:23.387
My name's Danielle.

19:23.388 --> 19:26.624
Constable Reggie, it appears
the Blorgons have developed

19:26.625 --> 19:30.061
- the ability to take human form.
- Weirdos.

19:30.062 --> 19:31.746
[Clattering]

19:31.747 --> 19:35.600
Your photonic bowler hat.

19:37.152 --> 19:38.986
Ahh.
[Sniffs]

19:38.987 --> 19:40.304
Blorgon patrol.

19:40.305 --> 19:43.324
Shirley, I have some
good news and bad news.

19:43.325 --> 19:46.744
The good news is the board loved
your sandwich shop idea.

19:46.745 --> 19:47.978
[Both squeal and giggle]

19:47.979 --> 19:50.247
The bad news
is that they made a few calls

19:50.248 --> 19:51.916
and sold the space to subway,
the sandwich place.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.277
What? Pierce and I put
a lot of work into that idea.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.921
- How could you do this, Dean?
- I'm sorry!

19:56.922 --> 19:58.456
The board went over my head
on this one.

19:58.457 --> 20:01.175
And I don't remember being
invited to your wedding,

20:01.176 --> 20:04.261
so I guess we're even
on the hurting-each-other front.

20:04.262 --> 20:08.432
I'm a blast at weddings.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.217
There go all my dreams.

20:10.218 --> 20:12.003
This is just a setback.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.288
You don't have to give up
just because of subway.

20:14.289 --> 20:16.257
Guess I better go break
the news to Pierce.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.675
He's not gonna like this.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.193
Remember that
temper tantrum he threw

20:19.194 --> 20:21.562
when Adam Sandler "stole"
his idea for <i>Jack and Jill?</i>

20:21.563 --> 20:22.813
You're underestimating him.

20:22.814 --> 20:24.065
I think Pierce
is a lot more mature

20:24.066 --> 20:25.316
than we all give him
credit for.

20:25.317 --> 20:29.987
Look at me now, dad!
How's it taste?

20:29.988 --> 20:33.874
How many sandwich places
did you have?

20:33.875 --> 20:36.028
[Cackles]
None!

20:36.029 --> 20:38.071
