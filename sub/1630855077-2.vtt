WEBVTT

01:10.080 --> 01:11.400
I surrender to you.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.280
You know what you said...
about surrender?

01:47.440 --> 01:48.520
Did you mean it?

01:52.560 --> 01:53.400
Yes.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.560
I'd like a glass of wine.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.240
So here are the rules.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.520
You wait for me to say when.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.680
You do not turn up uninvited.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.680
Nothing happens beyond these walls
without my permission.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.080
It is my choice to surrender to you.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.160
Do you understand that?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.080
I give you your power.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.600
And if you accept that,

02:54.320 --> 02:57.240
then in this room,
we can be whoever we want to be.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.320
Kneel

03:03.960 --> 03:05.640
and I'll give myself to you.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.000
Sorry.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
What's inside it?

04:13.680 --> 04:16.040
My thoughts, dreams.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.640
Moments I don't want to forget.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.360
Can I read it?

04:25.560 --> 04:26.400
No.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.600
Not yet.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.480
Do you let Jay read it?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.520
What time
are you off to see Anna?

05:16.960 --> 05:17.880
About an hour.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.160
I'll have a shower,
then head to the station.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.440
Things are getting serious, then?

05:24.040 --> 05:28.800
Definitely. I can't wait to take her
to Paris. It's a big deal for us.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.600
Yeah.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.200
- All right. See ya.
- Mm.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.160
Come on, boy. Let's go.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
Hi there.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.960
Someone else to introduce you to.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.520
- James. James, James, James.
- Ah, hello.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.880
- Our new tsar for children's medicine.
- Hello.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.080
- My son-in-law, William.
- Nice to meet you.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.640
- He is going to be marvelous.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.960
Holding the department to account.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.120
Sorry, one second.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.840
Sorry, Edward. Emergency at the hospital.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.640
Uh...

07:04.640 --> 07:06.000
I'm a friend of Anna's.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.760
Oh. She didn't say
she was expecting anyone.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.480
Sorry.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.160
- You are?
- I'm Peggy.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.480
This is my flat.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.840
- I'll get Anna for you, shall I?
- No, don't worry--

07:21.840 --> 07:25.920
Anna. Anna, your friend is here.
He wanted to say hello. Isn't that lovely?

07:29.560 --> 07:31.800
I can see that you're busy--

07:31.800 --> 07:34.880
I'm gonna open a bottle of wine.
Stay for a drink, won't you?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.480
I told you not to come.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.480
I only just got your text.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.040
Who is she?

07:49.560 --> 07:53.240
She's an old friend.
She only stays when she's in town.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.400
I keep an eye on the place for her.

07:57.960 --> 07:58.840
What if she...

08:00.720 --> 08:02.320
You didn't say who you were.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.440
Of course not.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.440
Nothing to worry about, then.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.160
Something's happening between us, I think.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.000
I can't imagine you having an affair.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.760
It's not

09:07.280 --> 09:08.400
an affair.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.800
Are we okay?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.480
It's just been a

09:23.120 --> 09:25.280
busy few weeks, you know?

09:27.120 --> 09:27.960
I know.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.600
Jay's taking Anna to Paris.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.560
Why don't we do something nice?

09:36.640 --> 09:39.560
I could book us somewhere along the coast.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.600
- Oh God, that sounds nice.
- Yeah.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.200
- Maybe when things are--
- Less frantic?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.360
Yeah, I know.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
Who are you?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.400
Let me read the diary.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.120
Earn it.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.040
It's us.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.400
The last time we were together.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.120
Do you write about Jay too?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.840
Why do you need to know that?

11:25.960 --> 11:26.800
Just

11:28.080 --> 11:29.480
trying to understand

11:30.840 --> 11:31.840
what we have.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.840
And what you have with him.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.960
Does he know that you come here?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.840
He knows not to ask questions.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.160
What if he found out the truth?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.600
There are so many other truths.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.000
Like I said, he allows me my secrets.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.360
What if you're wrong?

12:22.120 --> 12:22.960
Leave it.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.760
We have each other.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.800
Leave everybody else in my life alone.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.320
He has so much of you.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
I want more.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.640
I have so many questions to ask.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.920
Well, then, you'll have to learn
to love the questions.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.520
- Oh! What is it you're needing?

12:51.240 --> 12:52.200
I need

12:53.560 --> 12:54.480
something.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.960
Something he doesn't know.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.800
Okay.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
I had a brother.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.440
Aston.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.040
He died by suicide.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.480
No one knew why at the time.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.080
I'll tell you though, if you like.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.120
He was in love with me.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.120
What?

13:41.640 --> 13:44.080
He was completely infatuated.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.800
He killed himself because I rejected him.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.920
He killed himself because of me.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.680
I'm so sorry.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.760
Don't be.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Is that enough?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.080
Jay doesn't know this?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.400
Only that Aston died.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.440
Thank you.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.720
Does knowing it change anything?

14:32.040 --> 14:32.880
No.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.480
Maybe it should.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.560
Because damaged people are dangerous.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.160
They know they can survive.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.400
<i>♪ It seems so good to see you back again ♪</i>

15:26.400 --> 15:29.000
<i>♪ How long has it been? ♪</i>

15:30.680 --> 15:36.040
<i>♪ It seems like a mighty long time ♪</i>

15:36.040 --> 15:40.200
<i>♪ Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh ♪</i>

15:40.200 --> 15:45.200
<i>♪ It seems like a mighty long time... ♪</i>

15:45.200 --> 15:46.760
- Sally.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.240
Are you okay?

15:49.240 --> 15:50.640
Yeah, yeah, just

15:51.160 --> 15:53.120
lost in my music.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.600
Since when do you listen to music?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.760
<i>♪ You stopped by to say hello to me ♪</i>

16:13.000 --> 16:15.680
I think he's gonna
do something stupid in Paris.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.360
- Sorry?
Jay.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.560
Wouldn't surprise me
if he's taking a ring.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.480
Surely not.
Too soon for all that, isn't it?

16:28.560 --> 16:29.760
He's smitten.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.640
Obsessed.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.800
And who is she?
I mean, we barely know her.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.080
Maybe that's how she likes it.
But why?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.920
Because people deserve a private life.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.400
God, you're completely
obsessed with her too.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
Well, aren't you?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.200
I really haven't thought
that much about her.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.040
Well, maybe you ought to.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.960
Our son is in love.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.680
This woman could be in our lives forever.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.480
Where are they staying?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.920
Well, some place Anna chose. Hôtel Dumas.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.520
You'll be able
to come to Hartley early, then?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.560
Uh...

17:26.560 --> 17:27.760
No, I'm afraid not.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.480
I may have to go to Brussels on Thursday.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.440
Oh no.

17:34.080 --> 17:38.120
Yeah, sorry. It's a conference
on European health policies.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.520
I was hoping
we'd get a quiet one for once.

18:04.840 --> 18:09.400
<i>The next service to Paris
will depart in 20 minutes.</i>

18:09.400 --> 18:11.720
<i>Please go to platform number 3.</i>

19:53.640 --> 19:57.440
<i>Voulez-vous</i> drink some champagne,
<i>mademoiselle?</i>

19:57.440 --> 20:00.600
What?
<i>-</i> Smashing all the Paris clichés right now.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.480
I'm not complaining.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.160
They totally think
I'm drinking this on my own.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.400
Smart.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.560
Anything important?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.040
No.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.400
Good evening.
Madame Barton, please.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.120
I believe she's in room--

20:49.560 --> 20:50.920
Yes, room ten.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.040
I'll get it.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.240
Leave the hotel.
Go to the end of the street.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.640
What was that?
- Hotel reception.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.240
Asking if we're happy with the room.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.440
- I've got time to shave, haven't I?
- Of course.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.160
Actually,

21:31.600 --> 21:34.240
while you do that,
I might pop out for some air.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.560
- If you wait, I can come with you.
- No, no.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.080
Take your time.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.320
Sure. Well, don't be long.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.040
Oh.
What the fuck are you doing?

22:50.440 --> 22:52.560
You broke the rules by coming here.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.880
Don't even think about following us.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.360
I thought you'd got lost.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.840
- We should make our reservation.
- Sorry.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.400
I think I've got a migraine coming on.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.920
Really? I didn't know you get those.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.920
Not very often,
but when I do, they're horrendous.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.760
- God, are you okay?
- Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.440
- I think I just need to lie down.
- Okay.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.360
Sorry.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.120
- Sure there's nothing else the matter?

24:04.520 --> 24:06.480
Learn to love the questions, Jay.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.360
Hello. Do you speak English?

24:56.360 --> 24:59.320
<i>Yes, of course, monsieur.
How can I help you?</i>

25:00.120 --> 25:02.800
Can you tell me
if room number ten is available?

25:03.320 --> 25:05.040
<i>Of course.
Let me see, monsieur.</i>

25:07.400 --> 25:09.120
Room number ten, monsieur.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.000
-<i>Merci.</i>

27:58.680 --> 28:01.960
<i>Please keep
your belongings with you at all times.</i>

28:01.960 --> 28:05.160
<i>Unattended baggage will be removed
and may be destroyed.</i>

28:08.320 --> 28:09.160
You go ahead.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.960
I'm not great company.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.720
- Well, I'm not just going to leave you.
<i>-</i> I think I just need to get home.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.480
Yeah. Okay. Well, call if you need me.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.120
Bye, then.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.960
Mind how you go. Thanks.

29:37.120 --> 29:37.960
Mum?

29:39.200 --> 29:40.960
<i>Top, middle, or bottom?</i>

29:40.960 --> 29:44.680
<i>Well, let's go...
I'll go the middle.</i>

29:51.560 --> 29:54.400
<i>Ooh!</i>

30:18.440 --> 30:19.600
Thank you.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.440
Cheers.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.400
You dancing, then?
- Yes.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.080
Come on.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.120
So, why are you back from Paris so early?

30:38.600 --> 30:41.960
Oh fuck. Did Jay fuck up?

30:41.960 --> 30:45.160
No. No, no. He... he was perfect.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.560
So, what did <i>you</i> do?

30:51.160 --> 30:54.120
- You know William, the man you met?
- Hmm. The married one.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.280
He turned up outside our hotel.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.560
You're an absolute fucking danger.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.000
The thing is, he's not just a married man.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.840
He's Jay's father.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.560
Anna, what is this?

31:24.560 --> 31:27.360
- I'm so-- I'm just trying to--
- I don't need you to approve.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.640
- What if their family finds out?
- They won't.

31:29.640 --> 31:33.200
- Well, how can you be so sure?
- Because no one knows, and no one will.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.320
But that's not true, is it?
Because now I know, don't I?

31:38.600 --> 31:40.720
Anna, I'm sorry. Anna, please just...

32:27.840 --> 32:29.040
Anna Barton?

32:32.240 --> 32:33.080
Yes.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.480
<i>Put a smile on your face?</i>

33:03.160 --> 33:04.840
- Thank you.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.800
<i>Free tonight? There's something
I forgot to say in Paris.</i>

33:10.040 --> 33:12.560
Something is burning.
I can smell it.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.840
This is what happens when you come early.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.600
Keep walking.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.800
- I don't trust you.
- No, you have to.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.840
- There's a table coming up.
- I know!

33:21.840 --> 33:24.360
- Great. Now you're gonna feel for it.
- Okay.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.080
Oh yeah, there it is.
- Keep your eyes closed!

33:27.080 --> 33:28.920
It's gonna look like Versailles.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.120
Right foot first, left foot.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.920
Why? What's going on, Jay?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.560
You'll see.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.040
- Here's a beer.
- Oh!

33:38.040 --> 33:39.680
- Thank you.
Enjoy.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.160
No peeking.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.600
Uh-uh!

33:59.840 --> 34:01.960
Was the conference worth the trip
in the end?

34:02.760 --> 34:04.200
Yeah. Yeah.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.320
Glad that I went.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.720
That might be work.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.960
William?

34:30.720 --> 34:32.480
- William!

34:33.680 --> 34:34.760
What's the matter?

34:38.240 --> 34:39.640
I just need to make a call.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.480
What are you doing?

35:02.480 --> 35:04.040
I need to talk to you.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.480
<i>This can't keep happening.
-</i> I know. I--

35:07.480 --> 35:09.240
After what you did in Paris,

35:10.320 --> 35:12.320
I need you to do something for me.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.240
<i>Yes?</i>

35:16.840 --> 35:19.280
I think
Jay is about to propose to me.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.600
I want you
to give me your permission to say yes.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.520
<i>You know the rules.</i>

35:28.720 --> 35:29.840
<i>Tell me to say yes.</i>

35:35.160 --> 35:37.680
<i>William, what are my instructions?</i>

35:39.520 --> 35:40.480
Why?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.400
Because I want him.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.040
He's my normality.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.280
We're like any other couple.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.040
It's right.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.000
This is what I want, William.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.240
Tell me what I want of you.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.560
Anna...

36:11.960 --> 36:13.800
when Jay asks you to marry him...

36:16.160 --> 36:17.320
you will say yes.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.120
Be happy, my love.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.760
You won't have any less of me.
You'll have more.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.280
I hope so.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.360
<i>Yes, yes, much more.
Constantly more.</i>

36:36.120 --> 36:37.720
What did you need to tell me?

36:43.800 --> 36:44.640
Nothing.

36:53.040 --> 36:53.960
One<i>.</i>

36:56.040 --> 36:58.440
That better be it.
Well...

36:58.440 --> 37:00.080
- Shall I run back down?
Please.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.080
Put my chef's hat on
like in <i>Ratatouille.</i>

37:02.080 --> 37:05.200
I am actually in Paris.
I can see the Eiffel Tower and all that.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.480
How's your French accent?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.000
Jay...

37:26.640 --> 37:27.560
Anna Barton,

37:29.520 --> 37:32.440
something shifted in me when we first met.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.200
I've never felt so happy,
and that's because of you.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.880
Anna, will you marry me?

37:42.840 --> 37:43.680
Yes.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.960
- Yes?
Yes.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.200
- Yeah.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.680
Oh, wait. I actually have a ring.
Sorry.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.400
- I'm doing this all wrong.
- Oh, Jay!

38:06.000 --> 38:07.160
Oh, it's beautiful.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.520
Thank you.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.120
William.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.080
Are you all right?

38:22.920 --> 38:24.040
Yeah.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.360
