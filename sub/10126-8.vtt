THE MOST BASKETS,

10:05.467 --> 10:06.767
WHO COULD CATCH
THE MOST FLIES.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.900
OH, PLEASE. GET TO IT.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.667
ONE DAY,
MITCH SHOWS UP HERE.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.100
HE'S GOT
A BRAND-NEW BIKE--

10:12.100 --> 10:14.100
3-SPEED,
EMERALD GREEN,

10:14.100 --> 10:15.100
SPEEDOMETER
ON THE HANDLE.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.734
YOU HAD ONE
JUST LIKE THAT.

10:16.734 --> 10:19.200
EXACTLY. THAT'S
WHY MITCH GOT HIS.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.367
BUT SEE,
TO SHOW ME UP,

10:20.367 --> 10:22.600
HIS DIDN'T HAVE
ANY TRAINING WHEELS.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.867
I BEGGED DAD,

10:23.867 --> 10:25.734
"PLEASE TAKE OFF
MY TRAINING WHEELS."

10:25.734 --> 10:27.133
HE TELLS ME
I'M NOT READY.

10:27.133 --> 10:29.000
APPARENTLY
MITCH WASN'T,
EITHER,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.400
'CAUSE ONE DAY,
WE'RE RACIN' DOWN
OAKHURST DRIVE.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.033
DEAD-MAN'S HILL.
RIGHT.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.500
MITCH FALLS OFF
HIS BIKE,

10:34.500 --> 10:37.000
SLAMS HIS HEAD INTO
SOME GARBAGE CANS,
AND THAT, MY FRIEND,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.100
IS WHY
MITCHELL DAVIS

10:38.100 --> 10:39.734
REPEATED
THE SIXTH GRADE
11 TIMES.

10:39.734 --> 10:42.700
ERIC, WHAT DOES THIS
POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO

10:42.700 --> 10:44.900
WITH ME AND TOPANGA
MOVING PAST KISSING?

10:44.900 --> 10:47.133
CORY, SEX IS LIKE
A BIKE WITHOUT
TRAINING WHEELS.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.400
IF YOU TRY IT
BEFORE YOU'RE READY,

10:49.400 --> 10:51.567
YOU'RE GONNA FALL OFF
AND BREAK YOUR HEAD.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.834
SHAWN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ALWAYS USE THE WINDOW.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.600
I LIKE IT. DANGER.

11:01.600 --> 11:05.700
I'M SORRY I TOLD TOPANGA
ABOUT YOU AND CLAIRE.
YOU FORGIVE ME?

11:05.700 --> 11:07.567
YEAH. FRIENDS FOR LIFE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.900
GOOD.
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU CAN ALWAYS TRUST ME,

11:11.900 --> 11:13.400
ALWAYS COME TO ME
FOR ANYTHING.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.700
MY PARENTS ARE BACK IN TOWN.
CAN I BRING CLAIRE HERE
TONIGHT?

11:15.700 --> 11:17.400
JUST THROW IT
IN MY FACE.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.033
CORY, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:20.033 --> 11:22.000
THEN WHAT IS IT,
SHAWN?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.467
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT IF I COULD'VE
TOLD YOU SOMETHING,

11:23.467 --> 11:25.934
I WOULD HAVE?

11:25.934 --> 11:27.100
I THINK YOU KNOW

11:27.100 --> 11:29.100
THAT YOU CAN
ALWAYS TRUST ME
WITH ANYTHING.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.734
YOU SWEAR
YOU'LL NEVER TELL?

11:34.734 --> 11:36.300
I SWEAR.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.567
CLAIRE AND I
AREN'T DOING
ANYTHING.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.000
WE NEVER HAVE.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.467
THE REASON
SHE'S BEEN STAYING
AT MY PLACE--

11:42.467 --> 11:44.000
HER DAD HITS HER.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.467
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE HITS HER?

11:46.467 --> 11:49.700
AT NIGHT SOMETIMES,
HE YELLS A LOT
AND BEATS HER UP.

11:49.700 --> 11:53.233
CLAIRE'S DAD?
HE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF A BANK.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.467
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.700
GOOD JOB,
FANCY HOME,
A LOW-LIFE CREEP.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.800
I JUST CAN'T
HIDE HER AT MY PLACE
ANYMORE.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.834
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO TO THE POLICE.

12:04.834 --> 12:07.367
NO. THE COPS AREN'T
GOING TO DO ANYTHING.
WHY NOT?

12:07.367 --> 12:09.100
BECAUSE I'M A KID
FROM A TRAILER PARK,

12:09.100 --> 12:10.400
AND HE'S
THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF A BANK.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.567
WHO DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA
LISTEN TO?

12:11.567 --> 12:13.200
AT LEAST LET ME
TELL MY PARENTS--

12:13.200 --> 12:16.000
NO. YOU JUST SWORE
THAT YOU WOULDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.867
I NEED TO KNOW.
CAN I BRING CLAIRE
HERE TONIGHT?

12:18.867 --> 12:22.967
WHAT ABOUT HER DAD?
WON'T HE BE UPSET
IF SHE'S NOT THERE?

12:22.967 --> 12:24.033
WHAT ABOUT HER MOM?

12:24.033 --> 12:25.400
HER MOM'S SCARED.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.133
SHE'S JUST PRETENDING
IT'S NOT HAPPENING,

12:27.133 --> 12:29.600
AND CLAIRE'S
GOTTEN REALLY GOOD
AT SNEAKING OUT.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.700
YEAH. I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN MY PARENTS
GO TO SLEEP.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.934
IT'S OK.

12:59.867 --> 13:03.033
UH, KITCHEN. THERE'S
A BATHROOM IN THERE.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.100
YOU CAN SLEEP ON THIS COUCH.
IF YOU WANT MORE BLANKETS--

13:06.100 --> 13:08.200
THIS IS FINE.
DON'T WORRY,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.233
I'LL BE OUT BEFORE
YOUR PARENTS GET UP.

13:10.233 --> 13:12.100
OH. NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.133
IS THAT
YOUR MOM AND DAD?

13:19.133 --> 13:20.400
YEAH.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.133
THEY LOOK LIKE
NICE PEOPLE.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.567
THEY ARE.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.934
THEY ARE NICE PEOPLE.

13:27.233 --> 13:28.800
I LIKE YOUR HOUSE.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.233
IT REMINDS ME
OF MY AUNT'S PLACE
IN VERMONT.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.700
I SPENT
A SUMMER THERE ONCE.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.867
SHE HAD FLOWERS
EVERYWHERE.

13:35.867 --> 13:37.834
SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT PLACE.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.367
YOU'D WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

13:39.367 --> 13:41.100
AND EVEN BEFORE YOU
OPENED YOUR EYES,

13:41.100 --> 13:43.734
YOU COULD
SMELL THESE FLOWERS.

13:43.734 --> 13:46.667
YOU JUST KNEW
THAT EVERYTHING
WAS ALL RIGHT.

13:48.934 --> 13:51.600
SO, YOU WANT ME
TO PUT YOUR COAT
SOMEPLACE?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
NO, IT'S FINE.
REALLY, IT'S OK.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.000
I WALKED INTO MY DOOR.
I'M KIND OF CLUMSY.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.500
OH, YEAH.
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.667
THAT HAPPENS TO ME
ALL THE TIME.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.867
I MUST HAVE WALKED
INTO MY OWN DOOR
LIKE 10 TIMES.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.100
SHAWN TOLD YOU, HUH?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.567
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S NOT MY PLACE

14:13.567 --> 14:16.834
TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO OR ANYTHING--

14:16.834 --> 14:20.367
ACTUALLY, COULD I HAVE
A GLASS OF MILK,
IF THAT'S OK?

14:20.367 --> 14:21.467
YEAH.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.000
I REALLY THINK
IF I COULD TELL MY PARENTS,
THEY'D KNOW WHAT--

14:44.100 --> 14:45.300
TO DO.

15:18.567 --> 15:21.133
SO, UM, CLAIRE GOT OUT
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS
WOKE UP?

15:21.133 --> 15:24.233
YEAH.
YOUR PLAN OF PROTECTING HER
ONE NIGHT AT A TIME WORKED.

15:24.233 --> 15:25.900
FOR ONE NIGHT, SHAWN.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.667
GOOD. SO, UM,
NOW IT'S THE NEXT NIGHT,

15:28.667 --> 15:30.867
AND I'M WONDERING IF
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR DOOR
UNLOCKED AGAIN.

15:30.867 --> 15:33.200
CORY,
SHE LIKES YOUR PLACE.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.000
SHE SAID
SHE FEELS SAFE THERE.
CAN'T YOU JUST DO THIS?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.834
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE
FROM PLACE TO PLACE
BECAUSE IT FEELS SAFE.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.500
COME HERE.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.400
DID YOU SEE
WHAT THAT JERK
DID TO HER ARM?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.567
WE GOTTA GET CLAIRE,
AND WE GOTTA
GO TO THE POLICE.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.900
NO. COPS JUST
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.800
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU PUT A CHERRY BOMB
IN THE MAILBOX.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.600
THE COPS CAME
AND MADE THINGS WORSE
FOR YOU.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.867
YOU STOLE TURNER'S BIKE,
MORE COPS, MORE WORSE.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.000
SO YOU SEE MY POINT THEN?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.967
SHAWN,
YOU'RE A CRIMINAL.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.734
THE COPS
WERE DOING THEIR JOB.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.767
WE'RE GETTING CLAIRE,
AND WE'RE GOING
TO THE POLICE.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.700
IF YOU DO,
I'LL JUST LIE.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.934
CLAIRE, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING.

16:10.934 --> 16:14.600
LOOK, YOU COME HOME
TO THE PEOPLE
IN THAT PICTURE,

16:14.600 --> 16:15.967
AND YOU KNOW
THEY LOVE YOU.

16:15.967 --> 16:17.600
MY DAD LOVES ME,
TOO.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.934
HE JUST HAS
ALL THIS STRESS
AT WORK,

16:19.934 --> 16:21.667
AND I GET IN HIS WAY
AT THE WRONG TIMES.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.300
WELL...

16:24.300 --> 16:28.300
NO. HE'S WRONG, OK?
WHAT HE'S DOING TO YOU
IS WRONG.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.500
CORY...

16:33.500 --> 16:35.900
YEAH,
I'LL UNLOCK MY DOOR.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
Shawn: TAKE IT EASY.
I'M COMIN'.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.100
CORY,
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.567
WHAT, DIDN'T
CLAIRE SHOW UP?

16:54.567 --> 16:55.500
YEAH, SHE SHOWED UP.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.000
I'M FINE. IT'S REALLY
NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.033
OH, I'M SORRY.

17:08.033 --> 17:10.667
I'M SO SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.200
HE WON'T DO THIS
TO YOU AGAIN.
I PROMISE.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.500
SHAWN, YOU CAN'T
PROMISE A THING
LIKE THAT.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.400
I KNOW YOU WANNA
DO THE RIGHT THING,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.500
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
WRONG ON THIS ALL THE WAY.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.000
IN A YEAR AND A HALF,
I'LL BE OFF AT COLLEGE.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.133
UNTIL THEN, I'LL JUST
STAY OUT OF HIS WAY.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.967
CLAIRE, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
DOIN' A REAL GOOD JOB
OF THAT SO FAR.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.934
YOU'RE AGAINST ME
NOW, TOO?

17:33.934 --> 17:37.967
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.
NOBODY DOES.

17:39.834 --> 17:41.967
YOU DIDN'T MAKE HIM
DO THIS, CLAIRE, BUT...

17:41.967 --> 17:45.600
YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM STOP
ALL BY YOURSELF.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.600
I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO HIM.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.233
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600
WHY DID HE HAVE ME?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.200
COR, DON'T FORGET THOSE.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.300
I KNOW. IT'S A GOOD THING
MY PARENTS AREN'T UP YET.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.200
YEAH. GOOD THING
WE'RE STILL ASLEEP.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.900
YEAH, WE SHOULDN'T
BE UP FOR AN HOUR.

18:24.900 --> 18:29.100
MOM, DAD, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU BOTH.

18:29.100 --> 18:33.400
ANYTHING
WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
BEFORE WE WAKE UP?

18:33.400 --> 18:36.500
FIRST OFF,
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THESE.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.200
CORY...

18:41.100 --> 18:43.000
WE WERE TAKING CARE
OF A FRIEND

18:43.000 --> 18:45.767
WHO WAS BEING
ROUGHED UP BY HER DAD.

18:47.934 --> 18:49.834
CLAIRE FERGUSON?

18:49.834 --> 18:51.367
YOU TOLD THEM?

18:51.367 --> 18:54.000
NO. THIS TIME, NO.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.233
NO, HE DIDN'T
TELL US, SHAWN.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.600
SHE LEFT
HER SCHOOL BOOK HERE.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.066
SHE WANTED US
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

19:00.066 --> 19:02.567
WE DECIDED
TO RESPECT THAT.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.867
HEY, GUYS,
IF YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE,

19:05.867 --> 19:07.667
THEN THE ONLY THING
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT

19:07.667 --> 19:11.100
IS HOW TO GET HER
THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.000
WE TOOK CARE
OF THAT.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.500
DID YOU?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.967
DID YOU
CALL THE POLICE?

19:16.967 --> 19:18.734
NO. WE PUT CLAIRE
ON A BUS TO VERMONT.

19:18.734 --> 19:20.300
SHE'S GONNA
STAY WITH HER AUNT
WHO LIVES THERE.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.500
IT'S A REAL NICE PLACE,
DAD, WITH FLOWERS,

19:22.500 --> 19:25.000
AND IT'S
WHERE SHE WANTS TO BE.
SO WE DID THE RIGHT THING.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.734
REALLY? WHAT'S
GONNA STOP HER DAD
FROM BRINGING HER BACK?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
HE'S NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.967
WHO'S GONNA STOP HIM?
ARE YOU GONNA STOP HIM,
SHAWN?

19:33.967 --> 19:35.967
IS HER AUNT
GONNA STOP HIM?

19:35.967 --> 19:39.767
BECAUSE THE DISTANCE
IS NOT GONNA BE
WHAT STOPS HIM.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.300
I'M GONNA
STOP HIM.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.400
HOW?

19:46.367 --> 19:48.200
I'M GOIN'
TO THE POLICE.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.367
GOOD.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.967
WE'LL DRIVE YOU.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.934
I PROMISED CLAIRE
I'D TAKE CARE OF HER.

19:57.934 --> 19:59.800
WELL, NOW YOU REALLY ARE.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.300
IT LOOKS
REALLY PRETTY THERE.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.367
YEAH. CLAIRE SAYS
SHE'S REALLY HAPPY
IN VERMONT.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.100
SHE'S STARTED
A NEW SCHOOL.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.367
SHE'S MAKING
NEW FRIENDS.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.233
HER DAD'S IN
A THERAPY PROGRAM,
AND SHE SAYS

20:19.233 --> 20:21.600
MAYBE THEY'LL
SEE EACH OTHER
SOMEDAY.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.000
I HOPE EVERYTHING
WORKS OUT FOR HER.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.100
YEAH.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.400
WHY'S YOUR HOUSE
SO QUIET TONIGHT?

20:26.400 --> 20:29.600
UH, MOM AND DAD ARE AT
MORGAN'S SOCCER GAME.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.400
ERIC'S AT THE STORE.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.734
AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN...
ALONE...IN YOUR BEDROOM.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.967
YEAH, BUT IF YOU NOTICE,
THERE ARE NO CANDLES.

20:36.967 --> 20:38.400
WHAT ABOUT THE GRAPES?

20:40.033 --> 20:41.800
WELL, I JUST LIKE GRAPES.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.867
ANYWAY, LISTEN, TOPANGA,
THIS THING WITH CLAIRE--

20:45.867 --> 20:48.767
I MEAN,
SHE HAD TO GROW UP SO FAST.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.300
I KNOW.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.867
I JUST LIKE BEING 15...
HERE WITH YOU.

20:52.867 --> 20:54.400
JUST KISSING?

20:54.400 --> 20:59.233
YEAH. KISSING'S GOOD.
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:59.233 --> 21:01.834
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO ABUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.900
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

21:09.900 --> 21:12.467
HEY, JUST 'CAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING TO NINTH BASE

21:12.467 --> 21:14.934
DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
LEAD OFF OF FIRST.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.767
LEAD OFF OF FIRST?

21:16.767 --> 21:20.367
BASEBALL BEEN
BERRY, BERRY GOOD TO ME.

21:22.834 --> 21:26.233
♪ I CAN HOLD UP
THREE FINGERS ♪

21:26.233 --> 21:28.600
