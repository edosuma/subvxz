<i>- Aw, come on!
- I'm serious.</i>

01:25.255 --> 01:27.360
I was the last of my friends
to lose their virginity.

01:27.394 --> 01:28.797
<i>- Me too.
- Shut up.</i>

01:28.831 --> 01:30.835
- I don't believe it either.
- It's the truth.

01:30.870 --> 01:33.541
- I was very shy and conservative.
- Then what happened?

01:33.575 --> 01:35.546
Honestly, I started
watching a lot of porn.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.618
I watched a lot of porn too,
but I never thought to do one.

01:37.652 --> 01:39.356
<i>- Hey, Scott.
- What?</i>

01:39.391 --> 01:41.862
It's okay. Maybe you were
afraid you couldn't perform.

01:41.896 --> 01:44.270
- Oh ho ho ho!
- Touche touche.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.843
And, hey, you two have probably
had as much sex as I have.

01:46.877 --> 01:49.484
- I don't think so!
- I don't know, maybe.

01:49.519 --> 01:51.956
Well, maybe.
Maybe he has.

01:51.990 --> 01:54.330
Well, maybe.
Let's compare notes after dessert.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.635
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Where's the... It's this way.

01:56.669 --> 01:59.074
I can hardly wait.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.118
- What?
- Why did you invite him?

02:03.152 --> 02:06.393
- We're having fun.
- The conversation is lacking a little depth.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.095
So we'll change the subject.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.865
I could bring up
the Spanish inquisition

02:09.900 --> 02:11.570
and Scott would turn it
into a sexual innuendo.

02:11.604 --> 02:13.941
Sasha, I'm sorry.
He called to find out what I was doing,

02:13.976 --> 02:16.046
I didn't think.
I said come join. I'm sorry.

02:16.081 --> 02:18.586
- It's fine.
- Oh, no it's not.

02:18.621 --> 02:22.060
- What... what's wrong? - I just thought
it was going to be the two of us.

02:22.095 --> 02:25.134
I need to talk to you
about something.

02:25.169 --> 02:28.744
- Should I be worried?
- It's about my movie.

02:30.279 --> 02:32.983
- I told you I don't want to
talk about that. - We need to.

02:33.017 --> 02:35.518
Unless you've decided not
to do it, no we don't.

02:35.552 --> 02:37.953
- I thought you said you were
gonna be supportive? - I am,

02:37.987 --> 02:40.188
it's just already a little
weird for me and I don't need

02:40.222 --> 02:42.089
to discuss you fucking
five random guys.

02:42.123 --> 02:44.024
That's the thing...
they're not random.

02:44.058 --> 02:46.859
- What do you mean?
- I got the cast list today

02:46.894 --> 02:50.695
and I tried to talk to the producers,
but they wouldn't replace him.

02:50.729 --> 02:53.829
- Replace who? - One of the
guys in the gang-bang scene.

02:55.364 --> 02:57.397
We used to be engaged.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.534
<i>Yeah!</i>

03:01.569 --> 03:04.237
- Nice, daddy. - Sarah, you're up.
Get off the phone.

03:04.270 --> 03:06.804
- It's family night.
- Sarah, you're up.

03:06.839 --> 03:08.337
- Okay okay.
- Jeez.

03:08.372 --> 03:10.038
- Brat.
- Why is she so moody?

03:10.072 --> 03:13.240
- It's genetic.
- I'm here, I'm present, I'm suffering.

03:13.274 --> 03:15.775
No phones, blackberries
or carrier pigeons.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.744
You're suffering spending time
with your family?

03:17.778 --> 03:19.445
Jonah... next time
boys' night out.

03:19.479 --> 03:22.548
- These girls are annoying.
- I told you not to invite them.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.917
<i>Hey, Ari.</i>

03:24.952 --> 03:27.887
- Sir Richard.
- I'm seeing you Thursday.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.521
Yes indeed.
Virgin mobile festival,

03:29.556 --> 03:31.123
I got M.I.A. and Jay-Z
locked down.

03:31.157 --> 03:34.125
- Ahem!
- Oh, I'm in family mode and I can't talk.

03:34.159 --> 03:35.792
Oh yeah, family mode too, sir.

03:35.827 --> 03:37.661
Yes, well played, sir.
I love your family.

03:37.695 --> 03:41.297
- Ari! - Honey, he has twins.
How rare is that?

03:41.331 --> 03:43.499
Family time, we're here.
We're focused.

03:45.735 --> 03:47.969
It's your office.

03:48.004 --> 03:49.537
Hello?

03:49.572 --> 03:51.939
<i>I know Ari told me not
to call on family night</i>

03:51.973 --> 03:54.541
unless it's an emergency and I'm not
totally sure this is an emergency...

03:54.575 --> 03:58.411
it's okay, Jake.
Just hold for one second, please.

03:58.445 --> 04:01.847
<i>Jake, I told you not to
call unless it was important.</i>

04:01.881 --> 04:04.949
- It's Amanda Daniels.
- Amanda Daniels is not important.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.384
<i>- She keeps calling.
- What? Why?</i>

04:07.419 --> 04:09.853
<i>- She wants to speak to you.
- I don't want to speak to her.</i>

04:09.887 --> 04:13.089
- Should I tell her that?
- Tell her I want her to die.

04:13.124 --> 04:15.925
- Who do you want to die, daddy?
- No one, buddy.

04:15.959 --> 04:18.560
- Ari. - How about daddy
not talking a call

04:18.594 --> 04:21.629
during family time, huh?
Blowing off a billionaire.

04:21.663 --> 04:23.730
- What do you think Amanda wanted?
- I don't know.

04:23.765 --> 04:26.165
- Who cares? Let's bowl.
- Daddy!

04:26.200 --> 04:29.400
Come on, we're bowling.
Family time.

04:29.434 --> 04:33.070
<i>- Phil, I apologize for hanging up on you.
- I appreciate that, Eric.</i>

04:33.105 --> 04:35.773
<i>- But let's move past that.
- Okay.</i>

04:35.807 --> 04:37.774
I think you and I can agree

04:37.808 --> 04:40.610
that dealing with Johnny
can put a person on edge.

04:40.644 --> 04:42.745
<i>- How does that help us?
- It doesn't.</i>

04:42.779 --> 04:44.847
<i>I'm in a bind now.
The studio wants to know</i>

04:44.881 --> 04:46.915
when we can get
"johnny's bananas" moving

04:46.949 --> 04:49.184
and I'm embarrassed
to tell them

04:49.218 --> 04:51.586
that I may not even
be able to deliver.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.455
<i>- I'm working on him.
- Can you just get him over here today</i>

04:54.489 --> 04:56.657
<i>- and I'll work on him?
- What are you gonna do?</i>

04:56.692 --> 04:59.093
Look, I just... I just...
I wanna convince him!

04:59.127 --> 05:01.528
All right, I'll try, but he
hasn't spoken to me in two days.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.963
<i>- Over getting him a greenlit show?
- Yep.</i>

05:03.998 --> 05:06.065
- He really is nuts.
- Wait till you try to renegotiate

05:06.100 --> 05:08.600
- season three with him.
- Let's all pray that we get there.

05:08.635 --> 05:10.034
All right, I'll call you
if I get him.

05:10.069 --> 05:11.901
<i>- Please do.
- Bye.</i>

05:15.505 --> 05:16.939
Pfft!

05:18.508 --> 05:20.343
Morning, Jennie.

05:20.377 --> 05:22.578
Can you do me a favor...
would you try to find Drama?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.847
Uh, Vince is here.

05:26.749 --> 05:28.249
<i>Yo!</i>

05:28.283 --> 05:30.252
- Yo.
- You okay?

05:30.287 --> 05:32.889
<i>- Yeah, why?
- Well, you look like shit.</i>

05:32.923 --> 05:35.892
Thanks.
I didn't get much sleep.

05:35.926 --> 05:37.493
I tried to call you
a few times.

05:37.527 --> 05:39.394
Yeah, I figured
I'd come see you.

05:39.428 --> 05:41.762
- You're pissed at me.
- I don't want to get into it.

05:41.797 --> 05:44.197
Look, Vince,
I'm sorry, all right?

05:44.232 --> 05:46.232
I like Sasha.
I really do.

05:46.266 --> 05:49.034
- I didn't mean to insult her.
- I appreciate that.

05:49.068 --> 05:52.737
- So are we good? - Are you gonna
get her a part in "air-walker"?

05:52.771 --> 05:54.505
- I can't do that.
- Then we're not good.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.074
<i>The studio's gonna bring
on a new director today.</i>

05:57.109 --> 05:58.675
I think Ari got
Pete Berg to do it.

05:58.710 --> 05:59.876
<i>- Are you serious?
- Yes.</i>

05:59.910 --> 06:01.244
<i>- That's awesome.
- It is, Vince,</i>

06:01.278 --> 06:03.279
but the studio's already
concerned about you.

06:03.313 --> 06:05.782
- I don't want to make things any worse.
- She's talented, e.

06:05.817 --> 06:08.452
- I didn't say she wasn't.
- Steven Soderbergh thought so.

06:08.487 --> 06:10.521
Why are you so
adamant about this?

06:10.555 --> 06:13.857
Because she got an offer on another
movie and I'd prefer her to do this.

06:13.891 --> 06:17.093
- What movie?
- I forget the name.

06:19.262 --> 06:21.930
What the... what the fuck
are you looking at?

06:22.865 --> 06:24.632
- Are you high?
- Am I high?

06:26.601 --> 06:29.502
'Cause I need something done
and I actually come to the guy

06:29.536 --> 06:33.071
who I made millions of dollars for
and ask him to do it, I'm high?

06:33.105 --> 06:36.073
Fuck you.
I'll handle it myself.

06:42.745 --> 06:45.046
<i>10 meters to go.
Nailed-biting...</i>

06:45.080 --> 06:47.948
<i>- Whoo!
- It's a new world record!</i>

06:47.982 --> 06:50.918
- What do you think?
- You look adorable.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.553
- Not sexy?
- You'll be sexy

06:52.587 --> 06:55.522
when we're chilling by the pool in
Mexico, living off our tequila money.

06:55.557 --> 06:58.558
- I need money now, Turtle.
- Then I hope you're a better waitress

06:58.592 --> 07:01.560
- than you were a driver.
- I'm a better waitress than you are an athlete.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.929
That's because
your sexiness distracts me.

07:06.701 --> 07:09.004
Ew. Why don't
you two get a room?

07:09.038 --> 07:11.073
Get a job!
And your own house.

07:11.107 --> 07:12.907
- That's not nice.
- No, it's not.

07:16.878 --> 07:18.846
It's Carlos.
Do I have to pick this up?

07:18.880 --> 07:21.047
- Mm-hmm.
- He's always mean to me.

07:21.081 --> 07:23.382
- Pick up.
- Hey, Carlos!

07:23.416 --> 07:26.318
<i>- Why are people from Texas inquiring
about my tequila? - What people?</i>

07:26.352 --> 07:28.453
Texas people.
I don't like being spied on, Turtle.

07:28.488 --> 07:30.722
- Carlos, don't be paranoid.
- Who have you been talking to?

07:30.757 --> 07:33.157
<i>- You told me to find the money.
- What? When?</i>

07:33.192 --> 07:35.760
You said you wanted to expand and
I told you I'd find the money.

07:35.794 --> 07:37.628
<i>- I thought that was a joke.
- Well, it wasn't.</i>

07:37.662 --> 07:40.163
<i>I got in touch with mark Cuban, the
owner of the Dallas mavericks.</i>

07:40.198 --> 07:42.999
- I know who he is.
- Then get excited because he's gonna give us

07:43.034 --> 07:45.234
$5 million so you can build
a shiny new factory.

07:45.268 --> 07:47.436
- Is that what he told you?
- No, but I'm hoping that's what he'll tell me.

07:47.470 --> 07:50.171
<i>- So get excited! - I don't like
being left in the dark, Turtle.</i>

07:50.206 --> 07:53.441
If my family business is being discussed, I
expect to be the one who's discussing it.

07:53.475 --> 07:56.077
<i>- I'm sorry. - I'm coming to L.
A. to see you today.</i>

07:56.111 --> 07:58.912
In the meantime I don't want you
talking about my company to anyone.

07:58.947 --> 08:02.181
- What do you mean? - I mean don't talk about me.
Don't talk about my tequila.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.550
Don't even mention the name, not
to anyone, do you understand?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.752
<i>- Carlos, that... - I'll be at
your house at 3:00 sharp.</i>

08:06.786 --> 08:08.854
Be waiting.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.158
<i>Pete Berg is very excited.</i>

08:14.192 --> 08:16.627
- That's great, Ari.
- But I'm not gonna lie to you.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.695
He's heard the rumors and he wants
to sit down with you and talk.

08:19.729 --> 08:23.132
That's fine. I have a couple of things
I want to talk to him about also.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.434
<i>- Oh yeah? Like what?
- A couple casting ideas I got.</i>

08:25.468 --> 08:27.669
Okay, we'll see if we can
set up a meeting this week.

08:27.704 --> 08:29.638
See if you can set it
up for today.

08:29.672 --> 08:33.107
<i>- I don't know if he's available today.
- Well, call him and find out.</i>

08:33.140 --> 08:35.176
<i>- Is e around today?
- I don't need e there.</i>

08:35.210 --> 08:36.910
I don't know if I'm going
to be around today.

08:36.945 --> 08:39.313
<i>- I don't need a babysitter, Ari.
- Are you okay?</i>

08:39.347 --> 08:41.381
Yeah, it's fine.
I just want to get things moving.

08:41.416 --> 08:43.717
- I can hear that.
- Okay, call me back.

08:43.751 --> 08:46.319
<i>You got it.</i>

08:46.353 --> 08:49.655
- Why am I here? - Because I want
you to help me pick out a suit.

08:49.689 --> 08:53.023
You've always picked out your own suits and
you've done nothing but sit on the phone,

08:53.058 --> 08:55.792
- which you promised you wouldn't do.
- Because it was Vince.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.594
It was an exception and I am all
yours now, no distractions.

08:58.628 --> 09:00.596
- What do you think of the suit?
- Well, I...

09:00.630 --> 09:03.065
Dana!
Dana!

09:05.734 --> 09:07.769
Dana.
Hey!

09:07.803 --> 09:09.472
- Ari.
- Good to see you.

09:09.506 --> 09:11.607
- You too. What's up?
- You're in town.

09:11.641 --> 09:14.576
Yeah, for a minute.
I got a couple book signings to do.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.011
Well listen, I'm seeing
you next week, right?

09:17.046 --> 09:20.314
- I was gonna call you.
- Why would you call me if I'm gonna see you?

09:20.348 --> 09:23.449
Oh God, I'm an asshole.
Ari, I didn't want you to be my agent.

09:23.484 --> 09:26.652
- I wanted to be involved with the N.
F.L. team. - Involved how?

09:26.686 --> 09:28.787
- Good seats for one.
- Done.

09:28.821 --> 09:31.956
And then I was, you know, hoping it would
help promote my scholarship foundation,

09:31.990 --> 09:34.424
- so... but since you're not
involved, I figure, why... - listen,

09:34.459 --> 09:36.393
you can be as involved
as you want to be.

09:36.427 --> 09:40.330
Ari, I am involved... through Amanda Daniels
now that she's bringing in the team.

09:40.364 --> 09:42.699
- Where'd you hear that?
- I met with her yesterday.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.702
I'm sorry, man.
I'll catch up. Okay?

09:48.171 --> 09:50.907
<i>Look, animation
isn't that bad, you know?</i>

09:50.941 --> 09:52.608
I mean, you work an hour a week

09:52.643 --> 09:55.478
and you still get time to audition
for shows whenever you want.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.013
<i>- I had a friend that did it.
- Did he get any other parts?</i>

09:58.048 --> 10:01.050
<i>- No, but he didn't have any talent.
- And you think I do?</i>

10:01.084 --> 10:03.885
I watch "viking quest"
reruns on spike.

10:03.919 --> 10:05.986
Really?
And you like them?

10:06.021 --> 10:07.854
I'm freaky,
but yeah, I love them.

10:07.889 --> 10:11.090
Where's that accent from?
You Canadian or something?

10:11.125 --> 10:13.625
- I'm British.
- I knew it was somewhere smart.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.960
<i>- The smartest.
- Hey look, Jennie, would you mind</i>

10:15.994 --> 10:18.762
reading Billy's treatment and taking
a look at the monkey drawings?

10:18.796 --> 10:22.198
<i>- Yeah, I'd love to. - Then maybe I could
come in and we could chat about it.</i>

10:22.233 --> 10:24.333
- Of course.
- But do me a favor,

10:24.368 --> 10:28.070
let me know when e's not in the office
because I don't want to see him right now.

10:28.104 --> 10:30.806
Uh, yeah, you've got it.
Bye for now.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.607
Bye.

10:34.476 --> 10:37.144
What the fuck
she'd look like again?

10:37.179 --> 10:40.247
Okay well, he's coming in,
but he doesn't want to see you.

10:41.816 --> 10:43.550
So what am I supposed to do?

10:43.584 --> 10:45.485
Go meet Vince and Pete Berg.

10:47.154 --> 10:48.687
All right, I'll go.

10:48.722 --> 10:50.655
- See you later.
- Bye.

10:50.690 --> 10:53.557
- Hey, are we still not talking?
- Go fuck yourself.

10:53.592 --> 10:56.360
You wanna email me that
so I don't forget it?

11:00.165 --> 11:01.598
- I love it.
- It's really good.

11:01.632 --> 11:04.267
Yeah. I got mark Cuban thinking
about investing in it.

11:04.302 --> 11:05.936
Really?
Maybe I'll invest too.

11:05.970 --> 11:08.971
- Yeah? - Yeah, but you better
not lose my money, man.

11:09.006 --> 11:11.574
Because I'll kill you, Turtle.
And Cuban too.

11:11.608 --> 11:13.809
- I'm serious.
- You don't want that, Turtle.

11:13.843 --> 11:16.611
- Calm down, Bri.
- Turtle, what are you doing?

11:16.646 --> 11:19.147
- What? - Carlos told you
not to talk about this.

11:19.181 --> 11:20.981
I got nothing else
to talk about.

11:21.016 --> 11:23.050
<i>Turtle, that's your girl?</i>

11:23.084 --> 11:24.717
- Yeah.
- She's good.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.653
<i>- Hello?
- Turtle, Kenny Austin.</i>

11:27.687 --> 11:30.055
Hey, Ken.
It's Cuban's guy.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.590
Zzzt!

11:31.625 --> 11:33.159
- How are you?
- Great, thanks.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.127
<i>Please thank mark again
for the other night.</i>

11:35.161 --> 11:36.995
Why don't you thank him
yourself in person?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.697
He would love for you and Alex
to come out this weekend.

11:39.731 --> 11:41.265
Wow, we'd love that.

11:41.299 --> 11:43.267
<i>In the meantime,
let's talk tequila.</i>

11:43.301 --> 11:46.470
<i>- Okay.
- We did some research</i>

11:46.504 --> 11:48.471
and mark and I are impressed
with the company.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.407
- That's great.
- So I wanted to run some things by you

11:51.441 --> 11:54.076
<i>- regarding how we can get involved.
- Uh-huh.</i>

11:54.110 --> 11:56.778
How come I feel like
I'm talking to a wall?

11:56.812 --> 11:59.447
<i>- You're not. I'm listening.
- But you're not speaking.</i>

11:59.481 --> 12:01.716
I'm sorry.
I spoke to Carlos this morning

12:01.750 --> 12:04.684
and he prefers to speak
on behalf of Avion himself.

12:04.719 --> 12:06.719
I'll speak to whoever
I need to speak to.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.454
<i>I'm meeting him
today at 3:00.</i>

12:08.488 --> 12:10.923
I could talk to him
and get him to meet you.

12:10.957 --> 12:12.524
You know,
we just left San Fran.

12:12.558 --> 12:15.760
So how about mark and I come by
and we all talk together?

12:15.794 --> 12:19.164
<i>- Uh... - Text me the address
and we'll see you there.</i>

12:19.198 --> 12:21.732
Okay.

12:25.236 --> 12:27.337
- Where's Amanda?
- She's on a plane from Dallas.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.072
- Is she meeting with Jerry Jones?
- Ari, I don't know.

12:30.107 --> 12:31.940
<i>- Is she coming back here?
- At some point.</i>

12:31.975 --> 12:34.509
- All right, I'm gonna wait for her.
- Ari, you can't wait in there.

12:34.543 --> 12:38.112
Call the fucking cops.

12:38.146 --> 12:40.547
Yeah, it's funny when
you read it with your accent.

12:40.581 --> 12:43.049
- No, it's just funny.
- He's a gorilla.

12:43.083 --> 12:46.018
Yeah, but he's a cute gorilla.

12:46.052 --> 12:49.488
Yeah, he does kinda
look like me.

12:49.522 --> 12:51.757
Doesn't he?

12:54.794 --> 12:57.428
- Something else is going on with you.
- What do you mean?

12:57.463 --> 12:59.430
<i>I can hear it
in your voice.</i>

12:59.464 --> 13:01.799
You don't even know me.

13:01.833 --> 13:04.367
You're right.
I'm sorry.

13:04.402 --> 13:06.936
It's just so humiliating.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.739
- What is? - I thought I was
past selling myself out.

13:10.774 --> 13:13.742
This isn't selling yourself out.
This is good.

13:13.776 --> 13:16.644
And you're going to be great in it.
Can't you see that?

13:16.678 --> 13:19.746
To be honest with you, when
they first showed it to me,

13:19.781 --> 13:22.082
I thought they were
making fun of me.

13:22.117 --> 13:24.718
I was embarrassed
and then I couldn't turn back.

13:24.752 --> 13:27.254
You can and nobody
is making fun of you.

13:27.288 --> 13:30.156
But this could be
a life changer.

13:30.191 --> 13:32.892
- You think?
- Look, take the meeting with Phil,

13:32.926 --> 13:36.394
and if you still don't like what he has
to say, then tell him to fuck off.

13:36.429 --> 13:38.964
Yeah, okay.

13:40.766 --> 13:42.333
Yeah.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.538
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

13:48.572 --> 13:50.305
Uh...

13:50.340 --> 13:53.941
Pete, this is my manager Eric who's
supposed to be out of town today.

13:53.975 --> 13:56.242
I'm not, I'm here.
So what's going on?

13:56.276 --> 13:59.645
I was just about to tell Pete that out
of all the meetings I've had on this,

13:59.679 --> 14:03.015
it is so refreshing to have
someone with ideas for a change.

14:03.049 --> 14:05.249
- Don't kiss my ass, Vince.
- I'm sorry.

14:05.283 --> 14:09.252
I got Ari and this guy in my
head telling me to watch myself.

14:09.287 --> 14:11.622
I don't care about the rumors.
I care about making a movie.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.591
Me too.
You have nothing to worry about.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.325
- Nothing at all, Pete.
- Yeah, I know.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.761
'Cause, see, I don't really care
if you marry three porn stars.

14:17.795 --> 14:21.097
Marry a call girl. Marry some dude
whose sole job is to get you heroin.

14:21.132 --> 14:23.999
I don't care, just show up
ready to work, on time.

14:24.034 --> 14:26.001
- All right. - If you don't, I
will kick the shit out of you.

14:26.035 --> 14:28.170
- There's no reason to make threats.
- It's not a threat,

14:28.204 --> 14:31.005
it's a fact. I'll kick the shit out of you too.
Don't fuck around.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.507
- It's not gonna be a problem.
- Good.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.209
Okay, well then...

14:35.243 --> 14:38.545
wait. I have one idea I'd
like to run by Pete.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.348
- You know I'm dating Sasha Grey, right?
- I heard.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.216
- She's talented.
- I've seen her work.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.217
I saw her in
the Soderbergh thing

14:47.251 --> 14:49.319
and what was the other movie?
The...

14:49.353 --> 14:51.320
- "Smash cut."
- "Smash cut."

14:51.355 --> 14:53.589
She actually wasn't horrible
in "smash cut." I saw it.

14:53.623 --> 14:56.224
Do you think you could
use her in this?

14:56.258 --> 15:00.460
I... I hate working with couples.
I think that's a huge mistake.

15:00.495 --> 15:02.962
I think it's a terrible idea too.
We're thrilled you're on board, Pete.

15:02.997 --> 15:06.031
- It's just a suggestion.
- She'll read if you need her to.

15:06.065 --> 15:08.967
- Vince, you serious?
- We have great chemistry.

15:11.303 --> 15:13.637
I'll tell you what we could do.
She could, um...

15:13.671 --> 15:16.305
Uh, Jim Logan's
secretary, right?

15:16.340 --> 15:19.275
- I mean, kinda the Lois Lane thing.
- Exactly.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.143
- Maybe a small part.
- Yes!

15:21.178 --> 15:23.645
If there's a sequel, she kills.
How about that?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.847
- All right? That work for you?
- That's perfect.

15:25.882 --> 15:27.115
- All right, okay.
- Thank you.

15:28.517 --> 15:30.151
Carlos, so happy to see you.

15:30.185 --> 15:31.685
The feeling's not mutual.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.287
You know my attorney
Edgar Munez?

15:33.321 --> 15:34.989
Ah, thought he was
your hit man.

15:35.023 --> 15:36.356
He's both.

15:36.391 --> 15:38.292
Are you gonna invite us in?

15:38.326 --> 15:40.227
I am, I am.
Come in, come in.

15:40.261 --> 15:42.662
- I have a little surprise for you too.
- As I have for you.

15:42.697 --> 15:45.031
Edgar has prepared
a non disclosure agreement

15:45.066 --> 15:47.633
which legally binds you
from discussing my company.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.768
- I already agreed not to discuss it.
- I know,

15:49.802 --> 15:52.604
but this makes it legal and if you don't
sign it, Edgar will break your legs.

15:52.638 --> 15:55.106
Okay yeah, I'll sign.
But first I got someone I want you to meet

15:55.140 --> 15:57.274
- who you can discuss the
company with. - What?

15:57.309 --> 15:59.109
Carlos, this is mark Cuban

15:59.144 --> 16:01.311
<i>and his business partners
Ken Austin</i>

16:01.345 --> 16:04.247
<i>- and Kevin Shaw.
- Pleasure.</i>

16:04.281 --> 16:06.349
<i>- I love your tequila, sir.
- Great to meet you.</i>

16:06.383 --> 16:09.451
- What is this, an ambush?
- We thought just a pleasant meeting.

16:09.485 --> 16:12.787
Unless you're prepared to give me $5 million
to build my new factory, it won't be.

16:12.822 --> 16:16.023
Oh, I'm prepared.
In fact, we'd like to contribute even more.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.325
- Kevin, show him the bottle.
- What is this?

16:18.360 --> 16:21.428
I had this specially designed.
This is hot.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.063
<i>That's to show
you how we're going</i>

16:23.097 --> 16:25.598
to bring your company
to the States with a bang.

16:25.632 --> 16:28.467
- Did you know about this?
- No.

16:28.501 --> 16:31.803
- But I do like it.
- My father designed the original bottle

16:31.837 --> 16:33.504
with his own hands.
Did you know that?

16:33.539 --> 16:36.107
- No. - We meant no
disrespect, Carlos.

16:36.141 --> 16:39.709
The original is beautiful.
We just thought this was an updated version.

16:39.744 --> 16:42.378
It's shit.

16:42.412 --> 16:44.746
Now do you have $5 million
for me or not?

16:44.781 --> 16:47.248
Yeah, but we thought
we'd discuss terms

16:47.283 --> 16:49.083
the terms are my terms
or no terms.

16:49.118 --> 16:51.953
What if I just bought
your fucking company?

16:51.987 --> 16:53.587
- It's not for sale.
- Yes it is.

16:53.622 --> 16:54.655
- Go to hell.
- Hey.

16:54.689 --> 16:56.957
I'll call you, Turtle.

16:59.927 --> 17:02.294
- Jesus Christ, Turtle.
- What the hell was that, Carlos?

17:02.329 --> 17:04.663
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- What are you so upset about?

17:04.698 --> 17:07.098
I'm upset because I don't want to
sell my company, not for any price!

17:07.133 --> 17:09.733
<i>- You don't have to sell it.
- This is my family's company, Turtle.</i>

17:09.767 --> 17:11.901
<i>I have a brother.
An older brother</i>

17:11.935 --> 17:14.804
who doesn't give a shit about the business
and has wanted to sell it for years.

17:14.838 --> 17:17.473
Now it's only a matter of time before
your billionaire friend tracks him down.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.308
- Don't you have to agree?
- No I don't.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.310
He's the eldest son. My father gave
him more shares than he gave to me.

17:22.344 --> 17:24.212
<i>- So what does this mean?
- It means</i>

17:24.246 --> 17:26.614
that you may have just
lost me Avion.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.357
- Hey. - Are you on your way?
I'm sitting here.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.225
<i>- Absolutely, baby.
- Have you not left your office yet?</i>

17:41.260 --> 17:44.161
Yeah, I... I've... I'm stuck in traffic.
I'll be there in five.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.797
<i>- Okay, and leave your phone in the car.
- You got it, baby.</i>

17:49.033 --> 17:50.900
<i>Ari Gold's office.</i>

17:50.934 --> 17:53.802
<i>- Meet me in front of Wolfgang's right now!
- You got it.</i>

17:53.837 --> 17:55.938
I've been waiting
for 15 minutes.

17:55.972 --> 17:58.340
<i>- Don't take it personally.
- Personally?</i>

17:58.375 --> 18:00.109
They want me to be the star
of this show

18:00.143 --> 18:02.344
yet Phil keeps me sitting
around like a jerkoff?

18:02.378 --> 18:05.081
I'd like to see him make Simon
Cowell wait around like this.

18:05.115 --> 18:08.083
- Phil's probably in another meeting.
- Well, he shouldn't be.

18:08.117 --> 18:09.684
Hang on, hang on.

18:09.718 --> 18:13.287
Excuse me, could you check and see
when Phil might be ready to see me?

18:13.322 --> 18:15.756
- 'Cause I have another
meeting after this. - Sure.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.991
- What was your name again?
- Are you kidding me?

18:18.025 --> 18:21.027
Did you hear that?
Why won't they treat me right?

18:21.061 --> 18:23.896
- They will and they are.
- It doesn't feel that way to me.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.931
<i>- Johnny.
- What?</i>

18:25.965 --> 18:28.800
- Take a deep breath. - I can't.
I can't even breathe right now.

18:28.834 --> 18:31.468
<i>- Why are you freaking out?
- I didn't tell you earlier,</i>

18:31.503 --> 18:33.837
but my condo's being
foreclosed o

18:33.871 --> 18:36.206
nobody knows.
Not even Vince.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.441
Johnny, I'm so sorry.

18:38.475 --> 18:41.676
Naw, it's my own fault.
I overextended myself again.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.313
Look, you're about to be
the star of your own show.

18:44.347 --> 18:46.115
<i>- Just trust me.
- I do.</i>

18:46.149 --> 18:48.317
<i>- Call me after, okay?
- I will.</i>

18:48.351 --> 18:50.685
<i>- Hey, Jennie?
- Yeah?</i>

18:50.720 --> 18:52.320
Thanks.

18:52.354 --> 18:54.322
You're welcome.
Bye.

18:54.356 --> 18:57.125
Bye.

18:58.427 --> 19:00.261
Hey, Johnny,
sorry for the wait.

19:00.296 --> 19:02.730
It took a little longer
than I thought to set up,

19:02.765 --> 19:05.433
but I am ready for you right
now in the conference room.

19:05.468 --> 19:08.503
You know what, Phil?
We don't need to meet.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.005
It's good.
Make the deal.

19:10.039 --> 19:12.240
I'm in. Later.

19:18.646 --> 19:20.580
Let's wrap all of this.

19:20.614 --> 19:22.248
He's in.

19:31.190 --> 19:34.791
- Why are you drinking so much?
- Crazy week, that's all.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.859
- Bad meeting?
- She didn't even show.

19:36.893 --> 19:39.127
And you're stressed you
don't have your blackberry.

19:39.161 --> 19:42.861
You try going without a hair blowout for a week.
It's an adjustment.

19:42.896 --> 19:46.395
Well, that's
what we usually look like.

19:49.265 --> 19:51.199
No no, he's ugly.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.668
Well well well, looky here.

19:53.702 --> 19:55.569
There he is.
How are you?

19:55.604 --> 19:58.238
- Hi, Vince. - I don't believe
you've met my girlfriend.

19:58.273 --> 19:59.739
<i>- No.
- Hi, I'm Sasha.</i>

19:59.773 --> 20:01.840
- Hello, Sasha.
- You're throwing out the first pitch

20:01.874 --> 20:03.441
at my kid's little league
game, right?

20:03.476 --> 20:06.177
- I'll be there. Wouldn't miss it.
- The kids are so excited.

20:06.211 --> 20:09.613
Me too. Ah, looks like this
is the place to be tonight.

20:09.648 --> 20:12.083
- Who's here?
- My ex.

20:13.518 --> 20:15.585
<i>- Have a good dinner.
- Night.</i>

20:15.620 --> 20:19.121
- Vince doesn't look that great.
- Yeah, I don't feel that great.

20:20.256 --> 20:21.656
I gotta go to the bathroom.

20:21.691 --> 20:24.759
<i>- You just went to the bathroom.
- That was two scotches ago.</i>

20:24.793 --> 20:26.861
Are you carrying
your blackberry?

20:26.895 --> 20:29.463
I swear on our children's lives

20:29.497 --> 20:31.765
I have no blackberry
on my person.

20:31.799 --> 20:33.433
- Okay.
- All right.

20:51.215 --> 20:54.183
Very unique opportunity here.

20:54.217 --> 20:56.886
Ari.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.687
I was gonna call you
in the morning.

20:58.721 --> 21:00.522
<i>I wanna talk to you
right now.</i>

21:00.556 --> 21:03.290
<i>- Well...
- Ari Gold!</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:07.695
- Yeah?
- It's your waiter.

21:07.729 --> 21:10.231
Your wife asked me make sure you
weren't up to no good in here.

21:10.265 --> 21:11.966
Appreciate that.
Coming out.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.102
Oooh, Pete Berg, he's sexy.

21:16.136 --> 21:18.137
Well, you can't fuck him.

21:18.171 --> 21:21.507
- He's a big fan of your work though.
- Who isn't?

21:21.541 --> 21:24.843
- So you think you can play a secretary?
- What do you mean?

21:24.877 --> 21:28.779
'Cause Berg thinks you can.
And he says this could be a major part in the sequel.

21:28.814 --> 21:30.847
Oh my God, this is
amazing, Vince.

21:30.882 --> 21:32.315
- So you want to do it?
- Yeah.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.684
- Oh, I'm so relieved.
- Why?

21:34.718 --> 21:37.153
Well, now we can spend three
weeks together doing a movie

21:37.187 --> 21:39.488
and I don't have to watch you
taking it from your ex on film.

21:39.522 --> 21:42.124
- When does this shoot?
- I don't know.

21:42.158 --> 21:44.425
But you wouldn't do both.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.161
- Why not?
- Because you said you wouldn't.

21:47.195 --> 21:50.264
- I never said that.
- Yeah, you did.

21:50.298 --> 21:52.832
We were talking about
what superpowers you wanted.

21:52.867 --> 21:55.200
I was joking.
Did you force him

21:55.235 --> 21:57.669
to put me into this movie
so I wouldn't do mine?

21:57.703 --> 21:59.604
I didn't force anything.
Pete wants you in it

21:59.638 --> 22:01.672
and I don't want to watch
you fucking other dudes.

22:01.706 --> 22:04.207
- I thought this was settled.
- So did I.

22:04.242 --> 22:06.309
I can't handle this.

22:06.344 --> 22:08.978
- What's the problem?
- I love you.

22:09.013 --> 22:11.080
What?

22:11.114 --> 22:14.383
- Forget it.
- Jesus Christ.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.752
Sasha...

22:16.786 --> 22:18.386
Sasha!

22:18.421 --> 22:20.220
- Sasha.
- What, Vince?

22:20.255 --> 22:22.055
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Don't back down now.</i>

22:22.090 --> 22:24.490
You said what you meant,
be a man and own up to it.

22:24.525 --> 22:27.426
- Okay, I love you. - It sounds more
like you're trying to control me.

22:27.461 --> 22:29.695
I'm not trying to control you.

22:29.729 --> 22:32.330
I've taken care
of myself since I was 14.

22:32.365 --> 22:35.166
I don't need you to fucking
pretend like you love me.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.602
- I'm not pretending.
- You wanna fuck me?

22:37.636 --> 22:40.304
I... I don't want
to share you.

22:40.338 --> 22:42.839
- You wanna mark your territory?
- Yeah.

22:42.874 --> 22:44.841
Do it.
Do it.

22:51.915 --> 22:53.815
You know, slow down, Ari.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.550
That is the woman who is
tempting to destroy my life.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.918
<i>- And let it go right now.
- Never.</i>

22:58.953 --> 23:01.487
This is not very pleasant.

23:01.521 --> 23:03.955
<i>Get used to it.
It's gonna get worse.</i>

23:03.989 --> 23:05.156
Jesus, Ari... okay.

23:05.190 --> 23:06.390
Calm down.
Stay calm.

23:06.424 --> 23:08.692
Hello, you must be Ari's wife.

23:08.726 --> 23:11.360
And you must be the one that
sent the tapes of my husband.

23:11.394 --> 23:14.562
- I'd like to explain that actually.
- Walk away, Amanda.

23:14.596 --> 23:17.431
But you just called me
and said you wanted to talk.

23:17.465 --> 23:19.265
What... he just called you?

23:19.300 --> 23:21.801
- Yes, and then he hung up on me.
- Just walk

23:21.835 --> 23:23.335
the fuck away.

23:23.370 --> 23:25.637
- It must have been from the bathroom.
- Okay look,

23:25.672 --> 23:28.272
I'm sitting here with my husband
trying to have a nice meal.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.207
Perhaps the two of you
could speak tomorrow?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.209
Absolutely.
Understood.

23:32.243 --> 23:35.079
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- You're sorry? You're sorry for what?

23:36.815 --> 23:38.716
You're sorry for leaking
slanderous,

23:38.751 --> 23:41.220
- out-of-context nonsense...
- Sit down, Ari.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.759
... About me, huh?
And then rifling through all my hard work

23:44.793 --> 23:47.094
- to steal my football team?
- Lower your voice.

23:47.129 --> 23:48.829
- Fuck you, okay? Fuck you.
- Ari!

23:48.864 --> 23:51.398
No, hold on a second.
I've never hit a woman in my entire life,

23:51.433 --> 23:54.902
but I swear to God, in my mind right
now I am pummeling your smug face

23:54.936 --> 23:57.538
to a pulp for everything
that you did to me, my career

23:57.572 --> 23:59.941
and my family.
But not to worry, all right?

23:59.976 --> 24:02.444
Because I will prevail
because I'm a winner

24:02.478 --> 24:05.180
<i>and you're a whore with more
cleavage than talent.</i>

24:05.214 --> 24:08.717
<i>And I will not stop
until I destroy you!</i>

24:08.751 --> 24:11.019
Mr. Gold, I have
to insist that you leave.

24:11.053 --> 24:13.755
Excellent choice, because
I have a life to destroy.

24:13.789 --> 24:15.923
You just did...
beautifully, I might add.

24:15.958 --> 24:18.192
- Because all I wanted
to tell you... - Yeah?

24:18.226 --> 24:21.262
... Was that I didn't send the tapes.
I discovered that my assistant,

24:21.297 --> 24:24.064
now ex-assistant took
it upon himself to do so.

24:24.098 --> 24:26.330
See, he worked for you
once upon a time

24:26.364 --> 24:28.330
and he had his own
vengeance in mind.

24:28.365 --> 24:31.098
And as for the N.F.L.,

24:31.132 --> 24:34.032
I've been trying to contact you,
call you, email you,

24:34.067 --> 24:36.968
to get you back involved, but I
guess you were too distracted

24:37.002 --> 24:39.036
thinking about,
I don't know, my cleavage

24:39.071 --> 24:42.005
to think that I actually had
something to offer you.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.873
See, they and I

24:43.908 --> 24:47.810
thought despite all that had happened
that you could still be an asset to us.

24:47.844 --> 24:50.579
I don't anymore.

24:59.488 --> 25:01.957
- Let's get out of here, baby.
- I'll meet you at home.

25:01.991 --> 25:04.293
- Let's get...
- I will meet you at home!

25:09.866 --> 25:12.034
I'm sorry about that.

25:15.838 --> 25:17.673
What about a vodka company?

25:17.707 --> 25:19.508
We don't want
a vodka company, Turtle.

25:19.542 --> 25:22.210
Or a water company?
Wahlberg's got one.

25:22.244 --> 25:24.512
We convince him to sell,
make him the spokesperson.

25:24.546 --> 25:26.347
<i>We don't want water.</i>

25:26.381 --> 25:28.983
What about
Marilyn Manson's mansinth?

25:30.953 --> 25:33.887
Turtle, do you know that Texas
shares an 840-mile border

25:33.922 --> 25:35.956
- with Mexico?
- No, I didn't know that.

25:35.990 --> 25:38.692
Well, it does.
So I don't want water.

25:38.726 --> 25:41.127
I don't want vodka.
I want tequila.

25:41.161 --> 25:43.862
I want to make it the
official drink of the mavs.

25:49.168 --> 25:50.568
Well?

25:50.603 --> 25:53.170
He wants to make Avion the
official drink of the mavs.

25:53.204 --> 25:56.471
No wonder! This stuff is great.
And I know hard liquor.

25:56.506 --> 25:58.706
- You got any more?
- Check the cabinets.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.040
You should make
a banana-flavored version

26:01.075 --> 26:03.575
and make it
the official drink of my show.

26:03.609 --> 26:06.643
- We could all benefit.
- You don't flavor tequila, Drama.

26:06.678 --> 26:08.777
Plus the deal's not done yet
and I'm pretty sure

26:08.811 --> 26:11.045
I'd be the one who'd stand
to benefit from such things.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.081
I don't know, Billy.
Stars rule, baby.

26:14.116 --> 26:16.983
Your agency rules.
Don't fuck with us, Billy.

26:17.018 --> 26:19.653
You hear him??
Agencies rule?

26:19.688 --> 26:21.555
You're too funny, Lloyd.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.826
I couldn't find the tequila,
but I did find this.

26:26.860 --> 26:30.696
- What the fuck is that?
- Well, it ain't baking soda, bro.

26:32.565 --> 26:34.198
Sweet Jesus.
