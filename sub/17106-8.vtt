00:02.839 --> 00:04.719
NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy.

00:04.759 --> 00:07.360
-My best waitress is deserting
us, so, if you feel like

00:07.400 --> 00:08.199
waiting tables.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.400
-I dream about waiting tables.

00:09.439 --> 00:11.400
That's what I was put
on this Earth to do.

00:11.439 --> 00:13.560
-Seems you're missing a few life
sustaining activities.

00:13.599 --> 00:15.800
Eating and sleeping may seem
irrelevant, but, uh, for body

00:15.839 --> 00:18.359
strength, it's kind
of important.

00:18.399 --> 00:21.199
-Company's youngest ever
principle dancer.

00:21.239 --> 00:23.320
Saskia's recovering from an
injury, but over the next few

00:23.359 --> 00:26.199
months has agreed to take you
for repertoire class.

00:26.239 --> 00:29.120
-Calm down, training bra.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.640
I don't need your help, Tara.

00:30.679 --> 00:33.520
I'm fine without you.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.520
[theme music]

00:47.520 --> 00:51.479
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.479
Close your eyes.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.439
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.799
This is my chance!

01:04.840 --> 01:06.799
This is my chance!

01:06.840 --> 01:08.400
My chance to feel alive.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.599
NARRATOR: Margot Fonteyn's
most famous partner was

01:26.640 --> 01:27.799
Rudolph Nureyev.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.599
When they first met, she was 43
and the star of the English

01:33.640 --> 01:34.799
ballet world.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.799
Nureyev was a 24-year-old
nobody from Russia.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.599
On the surface, they had nothing
in common, but when

01:46.640 --> 01:51.519
they danced together, it was
like they one body, one soul.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.840
Ballet hasn't changed
much since then.

01:54.879 --> 01:58.799
Every day we do the same
exercises, and once a

01:58.840 --> 02:02.599
semester, the teachers examine
us, hunting for flaws.

02:14.159 --> 02:17.159
-Five minutes until pens down.

02:17.199 --> 02:19.159
NARRATOR: But the magic Fonteyn
and Nureyev had can't

02:19.199 --> 02:20.400
be assessed in a classroom.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.719
It was this wordless
understanding that bound two

02:26.759 --> 02:29.240
people together.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.599
And once it existed, it
could never be broken.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.840
-OK.

02:41.879 --> 02:44.680
Be back here tomorrow at 9:00
for some intense, yet

02:44.719 --> 02:46.719
rewarding pas de
deux scrutiny.

02:46.759 --> 02:49.199
-We'll be examining the first
and third years as well, so

02:49.240 --> 02:50.800
there's gonna be a bit
of waiting around.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.800
And guys, it's your
responsibility to be warmed up

02:53.840 --> 02:55.319
and ready to go on time.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.639
-You know, in rugby, there's
a bond between teammates.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.599
He has your back, and
you have his.

03:03.639 --> 03:05.479
-I have no idea what you're
talking about.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.400
-That's the connection we're
looking for tomorrow.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.800
-Oh, Saskia.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.360
Do you mind taking a look at our
contemporary pas de deux?

03:15.400 --> 03:18.439
-I've got physio at 5:00,
but yeah, I can give

03:18.479 --> 03:19.639
you a couple minutes.

03:24.719 --> 03:26.400
-Hey, I've got to make this
dinner shit, but we can meet

03:26.439 --> 03:27.800
back about 10:00, 10:30?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.560
-All I'm doing tonight is having
a hot bath, a massage,

03:30.599 --> 03:32.120
and going straight to bed.

03:32.159 --> 03:35.360
-Oh, I could help
you with that.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.039
That's inappropriate.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.280
Sorry.

03:37.319 --> 03:39.840
-It's exam week and that's
your partner.

03:39.879 --> 03:41.639
How are you not clawing
at your own hair?

03:41.680 --> 03:44.479
-Abs, what will be will be.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.319
-Come on.

03:45.360 --> 03:45.840
I'm buying you a shiatsu.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.800
-Those skills are white hot.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.520
-Be gone with your
compliments.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.199
We are not on speaking terms.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.479
-Why?

04:04.520 --> 04:06.319
-You broke up with Tara.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.639
Under Article 107 of the BFF
Code, I'm on her side for the

04:10.680 --> 04:12.120
rest of eternity.

04:12.159 --> 04:15.199
-I'd hate to contravene girl
code, but is there a loop hole

04:15.240 --> 04:18.519
to double as your
skating tutor?

04:18.560 --> 04:20.639
-Thought you said my
skills were hot.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
-Lied.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.639
[music playing]

04:40.360 --> 04:41.800
-So?

04:41.839 --> 04:42.480
Be brutal.

04:42.519 --> 04:43.279
We can take it.

04:43.319 --> 04:43.639
-No.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.240
It was--

04:44.279 --> 04:46.240
It was promising.

04:46.279 --> 04:47.839
Ben, you're really coming
into yourself.

04:47.879 --> 04:49.120
That had a lot of presence.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.439
-I have presence.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.800
-I can smell it from here.

04:51.839 --> 04:55.720
-Which was needed, because,
Tara, yikes.

04:55.759 --> 04:57.199
I'm sorry.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.800
I know you don't want to
hear that right now.

04:58.839 --> 05:00.120
-No, that's--

05:00.160 --> 05:01.800
um.

05:01.839 --> 05:05.160
Was there anything specific
that I could work on?

05:05.199 --> 05:07.800
-I wish I could pinpoint
something, but it was just an

05:07.839 --> 05:11.120
overall general impression.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.560
And I know you guys
are tied, OK?

05:12.600 --> 05:15.120
But keep working, because in
my experience, this is when

05:15.160 --> 05:18.199
the best breakthroughs happen.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.120
-You should've asked for
the less brutal option.

05:28.319 --> 05:28.959
-This place is dead.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.639
You may as well go home.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.480
You can practice your--

05:33.519 --> 05:34.519
-No, you go.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.279
I'll lock up.

05:35.319 --> 05:37.600
-Don't tease me, dish pit.

05:37.639 --> 05:39.839
-I want to do these by hand to
give them a proper going over.

05:39.879 --> 05:41.240
Wait, check this out.

05:46.399 --> 05:49.319
It's a new system for maximizing
accessibility.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.800
-I recognize this syndrome.

05:50.839 --> 05:53.120
Exam displacement activity.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.319
-Wrong.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.600
This semester has been mental.

05:56.639 --> 05:57.759
I'm finally in the zone, Jess.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.199
I feel like I'm on
operating on a--

05:59.240 --> 06:01.199
on a higher plane
of existence.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.519
-You should go to sleep, see
if you can astral travel.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.480
-I don't need to sleep.

06:05.519 --> 06:06.399
My brain is firing.

06:06.439 --> 06:07.199
I've never--

06:07.240 --> 06:07.800
I've never felt more alive.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.319
-All right, just make sure
you set the deadbolt.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.600
And stop tormenting
the crockery.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.600
-Saskia doesn't rate you.

06:26.639 --> 06:27.759
-That's not true.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.800
She pushes me because
she believes in me.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.079
-OK, then you keep rehearsing.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.439
I'm going to bed.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.199
-Well, what about I have your
back and you have mine?

06:35.240 --> 06:37.639
Were those just empty
words, Ben?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.040
-Beach tomorrow?

06:39.079 --> 06:40.480
0600 hours?

06:40.519 --> 06:41.639
Game day huddle.

06:43.519 --> 06:45.800
-I can't practice pas
de deux by myself.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.600
BEN (OFFSCREEN): She twitches
when she sees you.

06:55.439 --> 06:56.519
CHRISTIAN (VOICEMAIL):
This is Christian.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.839
Voicemail costs money,
so be interesting.

06:58.879 --> 07:01.439
-I know technically we're
not talking, but I

07:01.480 --> 07:02.600
really need your help.

07:06.879 --> 07:09.839
-My mom always used to tell me
off for picking my scabs.

07:09.879 --> 07:13.360
-Well, Ethan used to eat his.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.519
-She told me I was being unfair,
undoing all their work

07:16.560 --> 07:19.720
when they were just trying
to make me better.

07:19.759 --> 07:22.360
-Kind of like Tara?

07:22.399 --> 07:25.040
-You think I need fixing too?

07:25.079 --> 07:26.399
-No.

07:26.439 --> 07:28.480
No.

07:28.519 --> 07:31.839
Then again, I've always known
deep down that you were the

07:31.879 --> 07:34.279
pinup boy for the Academy.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.279
-They didn't tell me they
were going to do this.

07:36.319 --> 07:38.040
That place is unbelievable.

07:38.079 --> 07:39.720
-Ah ha ha.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.279
-OK, that's not--

07:41.319 --> 07:42.160
-Oh, hey come on.

07:42.199 --> 07:43.480
It's just exam blues.

07:43.519 --> 07:46.079
If you want to feel seriously
depressed, try

07:46.120 --> 07:47.279
failing veggie maths.

07:47.319 --> 07:49.120
I mean, what's even below that?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.040
-Tofu.

07:50.079 --> 07:51.720
See what I did there?

07:51.759 --> 07:52.480
-Ah ha ha.

07:52.519 --> 07:53.680
Bad joke.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.720
[beeping]

08:02.759 --> 08:04.800
VOICE RECORDING: You have
no new messages.

08:08.439 --> 08:10.800
-Move one more time and you're
sleeping in the laundry.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.040
-Sorry, I just have to
send this message.

08:21.839 --> 08:23.480
Maybe I'm not receiving calls.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.160
-Here, let me see.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.840
-Are you crazy?

08:37.879 --> 08:39.240
-All fixed.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.399
It may seem harsh in your
world of rainbows and

08:44.440 --> 08:48.639
unicorns, but relationships
are a power struggle.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.559
-I need someone to
help me practice.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.519
He used to be my partner.

08:51.559 --> 08:54.440
He's the logical choice.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.039
-Right.

08:55.080 --> 08:55.879
Pas de deux.

08:55.919 --> 08:57.200
That's your way of calling it.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.480
-He's your ex, not your
phone a friend.

08:59.519 --> 09:00.600
-He's not my ex.

09:00.639 --> 09:02.279
This is a temporary situation.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.360
But you're right.

09:03.399 --> 09:04.559
I'm not gonna call him.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.799
Even if I could.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.120
-Good for you.

09:09.159 --> 09:10.320
-I'm going over.

09:14.759 --> 09:16.799
-Oh, T, you're up late,
last minute cramming?

09:16.840 --> 09:18.240
-No, I was worried.

09:18.279 --> 09:19.799
That happens when you leave
someone 16 messages and they

09:19.840 --> 09:21.039
don't respond to any of them.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.519
-Well, I'm fine.

09:22.559 --> 09:23.919
-Obviously.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.080
I'm the one who's stuck with
a pas de deux partner who

09:25.120 --> 09:26.480
doesn't believe in practice
or deodorant.

09:26.519 --> 09:28.559
And when I call to
ask for help--

09:28.600 --> 09:30.480
-My phone must have been flat.

09:30.519 --> 09:31.600
Sorry.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.480
-Oh, I can absolutely
help you practice.

09:32.519 --> 09:33.679
Let's go down to
the studio now.

09:33.720 --> 09:34.320
See?

09:34.360 --> 09:35.480
Problem solved.

09:35.519 --> 09:36.559
-That's not the point.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.440
The point is--

09:37.480 --> 09:38.399
-The point?

09:38.440 --> 09:38.799
-The--

09:38.840 --> 09:39.440
The--

09:39.480 --> 09:40.159
The point is that--

09:40.200 --> 09:41.679
The--

09:41.720 --> 09:44.279
The point is you shouldn't let
your battery run down so low.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.480
-Uh, actually it prolongs their
life and it gives them a

09:46.519 --> 09:47.679
proper recharge.

09:49.879 --> 09:52.799
-Good night.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.639
[music playing]

10:09.679 --> 10:11.279
-Tell me again how this
is supposed to

10:11.320 --> 10:12.639
help with pas de deux.

10:12.679 --> 10:15.799
-Ah, resistance training, plus
all the zen benefits.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.559
I always try to get in a swim
before a big performance.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.279
Cleans out the brain cavities.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.720
-That's kind of like why I
collect four leaf clovers.

10:22.759 --> 10:26.360
It's the only time my mind
goes completely stiff.

10:26.399 --> 10:28.399
-The only time?

10:28.440 --> 10:29.360
Come on.

10:29.399 --> 10:30.519
I thought you wanted
to practice?

10:30.559 --> 10:31.440
-Here?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.679
-Yeah.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.200
-Ah!

10:57.639 --> 10:58.759
-You ready?

10:58.799 --> 11:00.639
-I'm so ready, I've been
there and back.

11:00.679 --> 11:01.519
We were brilliant.

11:01.559 --> 11:02.320
-Ah.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.759
So should I go back to bed?

11:04.799 --> 11:07.600
-Let's crack this puppy open.

11:07.639 --> 11:09.759
-So what else happens
on game day?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.159
-Ah, steak for breakfast, and
usually just trying to avoid

11:12.200 --> 11:13.440
unnecessary stress.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.600
-Where is he?

11:14.639 --> 11:15.360
-Like that.

11:15.399 --> 11:16.639
-Where is who?

11:16.679 --> 11:18.559
-You've sabotaged my exam
prospects because of the

11:18.600 --> 11:21.480
latest installment in your
ridiculous romantic saga.

11:21.519 --> 11:22.320
-Christian's not here.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.039
-An incisive deduction, Tara.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.279
We're supposed to be on next.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.679
[knocking]

11:39.720 --> 11:41.679
-Miss, uh, Kat's brother's
here to see her.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.679
Family emergency.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.080
-Ethan?

11:46.799 --> 11:48.440
-I'm busting you out.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.600
-What?

11:49.639 --> 11:51.600
-I suddenly got the urge
to do something fun.

11:51.639 --> 11:53.600
And I couldn't think of
a more worthy wingman.

11:53.639 --> 11:55.039
-Ah, OK.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.360
But aren't you meant to be in
pas de deux this morning?

11:56.399 --> 11:57.159
-You're right.

11:57.200 --> 11:57.799
Exams.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.799
They're depressing.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.559
-Ah, no, no.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.279
You can't listen to me.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.039
My life is a mess.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.440
They could kick you
out for ditching.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.559
-Well, maybe they should.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.679
-Go back.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.240
I'm serious.

12:09.279 --> 12:11.120
I don't want you on
my conscience.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.440
-Can you try him from
your phone?

12:41.679 --> 12:42.480
[beep]

12:42.519 --> 12:43.600
VOICEMAIL: This is Christian.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.440
Voicemail costs money,
so be interesting.

12:51.279 --> 12:52.720
-Thank you.

12:52.759 --> 12:53.559
-No, thank you, Ms. Raine.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.120
That was fun.

12:56.159 --> 12:57.320
-Next couple, please.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.039
-I'm sorry, my partner's
not here.

13:06.080 --> 13:06.720
-Where's Christian?

13:06.759 --> 13:09.279
-Oh, chest infection.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.320
He's been coughing up a lung.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.080
But um, I've, I've done
it with Abby.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.639
I can do it with her.

13:13.679 --> 13:15.679
-Um, or I could go with Grace.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.039
Turn it into a duo?

13:17.080 --> 13:20.399
-Instantly a whole new take on
some tired choreography?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.840
-Thank you, Grace.

13:21.879 --> 13:25.200
But Samuel should take the
opportunity to perform again.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.360
It can only get better.

13:27.399 --> 13:28.559
First positions.

13:51.559 --> 13:53.080
-You got safe hands.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.600
-Ah!

14:01.799 --> 14:03.120
-So interesting.

14:03.159 --> 14:05.480
I didn't even know Kat
had a brother.

14:05.519 --> 14:06.399
-So are you two close?

14:06.440 --> 14:07.600
-Yeah, I love Kat.

14:10.200 --> 14:10.919
-Don't feel special.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.360
They're boy starved here.

14:12.399 --> 14:14.279
-Bye, Kat's brother.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.200
-So, what are we up to now?

14:16.240 --> 14:18.720
-We are taking you back
to the Academy.

14:18.759 --> 14:20.480
-What else have you
got in mind?

14:20.519 --> 14:21.679
-Uh, I've got work.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.759
You'd have to help
out, though.

14:22.799 --> 14:24.399
And I don't think you'd
be into it.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.639
[phone ringing]

14:27.679 --> 14:29.159
-Lead the way.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.559
-OK.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.360
-There's still time
to get back.

14:33.399 --> 14:35.799
Look, I know you're mad at me,
Christian, but you can't throw

14:35.840 --> 14:38.639
away this whole semester.

14:38.679 --> 14:40.679
-If I've shattered my
spine, the blood is

14:40.720 --> 14:42.159
on your hands, Christian!

14:42.200 --> 14:43.320
-Come on.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.120
Dr. Weeks is gonna make
you feel all better.

14:46.159 --> 14:48.559
-So Christian's a no show.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.519
What did you do this time?

14:51.559 --> 14:52.759
-It's personal.

14:55.159 --> 14:58.720
Saskia, have I done anything
to offend you?

14:58.759 --> 15:01.120
-Why would you ask that?

15:01.159 --> 15:03.080
-Well, someone said they
thought maybe you had a

15:03.120 --> 15:05.440
problem with me, just because
you've been giving me a hard

15:05.480 --> 15:06.879
time in class.

15:06.919 --> 15:09.279
-Tara, I give you a hard time in
class because you need it.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.279
You know it's a difficult
body to work with.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.720
Imagine how embarrassing it'd be
for both of us if the star

15:14.759 --> 15:16.759
of first year failed.

15:16.799 --> 15:19.759
Hm?

15:19.799 --> 15:21.440
-Did you see it?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.440
The twitch?

15:22.480 --> 15:23.240
Hm.

15:23.279 --> 15:24.759
She really doesn't rate you.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.440
-I have to take my opportunities
to dance where I

15:29.480 --> 15:30.759
can find them.

15:30.799 --> 15:34.720
Now that I'm not
at the Academy.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.279
Do you like how subtle
that was?

15:36.320 --> 15:37.240
-Mm.

15:37.279 --> 15:38.159
You should go into
life coaching.

15:38.200 --> 15:38.639
-Yeah.

15:38.679 --> 15:40.279
-Here we go.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.480
Arr.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.759
-Is anyone here named
Charlotte?

15:46.799 --> 15:48.720
Come here.

15:48.759 --> 15:49.720
Come on, girl.

15:49.759 --> 15:52.240
Let's have a fairy party.

15:52.279 --> 15:56.799
Fairies of old, fairies o new,
sprinkle on fairy dust, and

15:56.840 --> 15:59.360
you'll be one, too!

15:59.399 --> 16:02.519
My name's Lilac, and I'm
the birthday fairy!

16:02.559 --> 16:05.240
This is my sidekick,
Captain Backflip!

16:10.200 --> 16:14.039
Who wants to become a part of
the magical fairy club?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.159
Follow me, girls!

16:16.200 --> 16:18.679
Fairy wings up, fairy
wings down.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.639
Fairy wings up, fairy
wings down.

16:21.679 --> 16:24.159
Skip and run, run, run,
run, fairy toes!

16:27.600 --> 16:30.080
Point your toes.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.440
And curtsie!

16:32.480 --> 16:35.799
Run, run, run, run,
run, fairy toes!

16:35.840 --> 16:36.759
Whee!

16:36.799 --> 16:39.759
Kick those fairy feet!

16:39.799 --> 16:41.159
Around we go!

16:45.360 --> 16:46.320
-Hi.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.159
-Captain Backflip is
a stupid name.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.799
I bet you can't even do one.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.519
-Yes, I can.

16:53.559 --> 16:55.000
It's just my day off.

16:55.039 --> 16:59.159
-Isn't my dad paying you?

16:59.200 --> 17:05.079
[phone ringing]

17:05.118 --> 17:06.279
-OK.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.039
-Abigail, we should talk about
why you were so uncomfortable

17:17.079 --> 17:18.400
dancing with me before.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.319
If you're not over our
relationship, it's nothing to

17:20.358 --> 17:21.759
be ashamed of.

17:21.799 --> 17:23.759
-What did you just say?

17:23.799 --> 17:27.118
[phone ringing]

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
-Work.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.599
Hey, Jess.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.200
-When I threw you the keys, and
you caught them, were you

17:31.240 --> 17:32.759
just working on your
ball skills?

17:32.799 --> 17:33.319
-What?

17:33.359 --> 17:33.799
No, no.

17:33.839 --> 17:34.519
I locked up.

17:34.559 --> 17:35.799
-Interesting.

17:35.839 --> 17:37.359
Because the keys are here,
and you know what's not?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.359
Last night's takings.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.559
You realize--

17:40.599 --> 17:42.279
-Do you know how over our
relationship I am?

17:42.319 --> 17:45.000
I'm so over it I'd like it
expunged from my memory.

17:45.039 --> 17:45.599
-Hang on a sec.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.359
Wait.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.119
JESS (OVER PHONE): What?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.160
-No, not you, Jess.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.559
I can't believe I could
have done that.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.599
-You're the most self indulgent,
conceited,

17:52.640 --> 17:55.759
inconsiderate, deranged
person I've ever met.

17:55.799 --> 17:57.160
-I'll talk to you later.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.599
I have to call the police.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.599
-You did not break my heart.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.000
But you have broken my coccyx.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.440
-The scan looks fine, Abigail.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.640
I think it's just some
slight bruising.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.119
You look pale.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.319
How are you feeling?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.079
-Actually, there's this
tightness in my chest.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.279
-Is there a problem, Tara?

18:38.319 --> 18:40.160
-Ms. Raine, could I talk
to you outside.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.359
-This is an exam.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.720
Whatever you to say, you
can say to the panel.

18:43.759 --> 18:44.759
-Please?

18:44.799 --> 18:46.160
It's private.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.799
I don't think Saskia is
going mark me fairly.

18:58.839 --> 19:00.599
She's been repeatedly
awful to me, and--

19:00.640 --> 19:02.559
-Stop.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.759
I asked Saskia to be tough
on you to push you.

19:04.799 --> 19:05.759
And she says you've been
more focused on

19:05.799 --> 19:07.680
boyfriends than her class.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.160
-That-- that's not true.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.359
-I know you, Tara.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.799
-We've talked about your
distorted priorities.

19:13.839 --> 19:16.519
I'll let you come back in this
afternoon, but you will not

19:16.559 --> 19:18.759
make anymore excuses for
being under-prepared.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.720
But when it comes down to it,
I want a beach memorial.

19:29.759 --> 19:31.400
You know?

19:31.440 --> 19:35.680
My favorite song, with some
classic Sammy stories.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.559
A bit of dancing.

19:37.599 --> 19:38.759
Write that down.

19:44.039 --> 19:46.119
-20 controlled breaths next time
you're feeling panicky.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.240
-It's not a panic attack.

19:47.279 --> 19:48.079
It's my heart.

19:48.119 --> 19:49.559
You need to order an ECG.

19:49.599 --> 19:50.720
-Blow.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.960
How many of these has
he been drinking?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.039
-Is it a sugar frenzy?

19:57.079 --> 19:59.039
He doesn't do well
with red cordial.

19:59.079 --> 20:00.720
-And far too much caffeine.

20:00.759 --> 20:03.119
No wonder your heart's racing.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.119
This is liquid poison.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.359
How's that feeling now?

20:08.400 --> 20:09.759
-It's so weird.

20:09.799 --> 20:13.119
I can see my name in lights.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.279
-You'll live.

20:14.319 --> 20:15.400
At least you will if you
stop drinking these.

20:20.279 --> 20:21.160
-Ah.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.400
Can you smell that?

20:23.440 --> 20:26.200
The salt in the harbor.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.240
The apple blossoms
in your shampoo.

20:29.279 --> 20:31.400
-You overdosed on
energy drinks.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.759
Not quite a near death
experience.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.359
-Even your cranky voice sounds
beautiful to me.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.839
-Can I ask?

20:37.880 --> 20:39.960
The reason you're working all
these extra hours is so you

20:40.000 --> 20:41.240
can afford to stay
at the Academy.

20:41.279 --> 20:42.599
-Mm-hm.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.119
-Is that not a pointless
exercise if you're gonna fail

20:44.160 --> 20:45.279
your exams?

20:45.319 --> 20:47.440
-I'm going to fail.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.519
I'm going to get the
scholarship.

20:48.559 --> 20:49.640
You saw me in pas de
deux this morning.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.680
I'm brilliant.

20:50.720 --> 20:55.240
-Deluded if you think
you danced well.

20:55.279 --> 20:57.680
-You really think that?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.359
-You've gone backwards
since last year.

21:02.039 --> 21:04.160
-It's like everything that
I do is under obligation.

21:06.680 --> 21:11.519
-I auditioned for the Academy
because of my mom, and this

21:11.559 --> 21:13.119
year with Tara.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.440
I think she expects me to be
that guy on the poster.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.960
You know what I mean?

21:23.599 --> 21:24.720
-You boys having fun?

21:24.759 --> 21:26.519
If he'd stop talking.

21:26.559 --> 21:28.079
-Oh.

21:28.119 --> 21:29.440
-Thank you.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.119
I don't know if I'm that
guy on the poster.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.759
I could be.

21:33.799 --> 21:36.079
I think I'd just like
the chance to figure

21:36.119 --> 21:37.319
that out for myself.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.720
OK, you gotta get more
height and then just

21:42.759 --> 21:44.200
go with your instincts.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.160
-Did you see that?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.279
-There it is.

21:50.319 --> 21:51.319
CHRISTIAN (VOICEMAIL):
This is Christian.

21:51.359 --> 21:54.960
Voicemail costs money, so--

21:55.000 --> 21:56.319
-Hey.

21:56.359 --> 21:59.079
I found you something.

21:59.119 --> 22:02.599
-Wow, thanks, Ben.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.519
Um.

22:03.559 --> 22:06.400
Is that chewing gum?

22:06.440 --> 22:08.720
-I couldn't find a four.

22:08.759 --> 22:12.759
Those three-leaf ones are
overrepresented So, you ready

22:12.799 --> 22:15.079
to go back in?

22:15.119 --> 22:17.759
-Oh, uh, yeah, arms out.

22:17.799 --> 22:19.119
-I'm fine as I am.

22:26.359 --> 22:28.359
-I'm sorry.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.480
-You've been replaced.

22:29.519 --> 22:30.680
You're dead to me.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.559
-No, you're safer
with Christian.

22:32.599 --> 22:36.519
I'm no good to anyone until
I get some sleep.

22:36.559 --> 22:40.519
-FYI, according to the panel,
you have a chest infection.

22:54.079 --> 22:56.279
NARRATOR: Fonteyn and Nureyev
both danced with other people.

23:02.079 --> 23:05.160
It wasn't the same bond,
but it was brilliant

23:05.200 --> 23:06.319
in different ways.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.240
That's the beauty
of pas de deux.

23:13.279 --> 23:17.559
You don't have to carry
it all by yourself.

23:17.599 --> 23:21.319
If the bond is strong enough,
even when you're dancing solo,

23:21.359 --> 23:22.680
you know you're not alone.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.039
-Yay!

23:27.680 --> 23:29.240
-You came back.

23:29.279 --> 23:30.559
-Not for you.

23:30.599 --> 23:32.720
For me.

23:32.759 --> 23:35.720
Decided to keep my
options open.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.640
NARRATOR: Maybe the very hardest
part of connecting

23:37.680 --> 23:42.759
with anyone is when you have to
let them go, and just hope

23:42.799 --> 23:45.640
they find a way to
come back to you.
