down here and grab the paper.

do the drawing for you.

Yes, so you clamp it
to the table.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.605
You set whatever's
in front of you.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.373
Then you look through it
and you see basically

04:00.373 --> 04:02.175
what looks like
a three-dimensional hologram

04:02.175 --> 04:03.477
of whatever's
in front of you.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.045
Then you can draw
over that.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.713
And it's not as simple
as just tracing paper.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.148
It actually involves
a little more skill,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.483

a little more practice.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.884

04:10.884 --> 04:12.352

The first time you do it,

04:12.352 --> 04:13.954
and you work with it
for 30 minutes,

04:13.954 --> 04:15.122
you're gonna be
drawing things

you can draw.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.225

04:18.225 --> 04:20.193

on this.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.129

around for a long time.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.764

On the improvements.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.234
And so the historical device --
it had a lot of issues.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.702
It's a reason
that people stopped using it.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.670
The image was small.
It was unsteady.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.440
And I spent four years
tinkering in my garage

04:33.440 --> 04:35.275
making it work
and making it new again

04:35.275 --> 04:37.244
so it's something that artists
want to use again today.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.346

04:39.346 --> 04:40.647

to take it serious.

are to people learning to draw.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.621

04:47.621 --> 04:49.156

just as good without it,

04:49.156 --> 04:50.724

their process.

that 60% in the middle

04:52.793 --> 04:54.394

since I was a little kid,

05:09.176 --> 05:10.577

05:10.577 --> 05:13.146

to school, and my teacher

05:13.146 --> 05:15.348
had brought in the historical
device into class,

05:15.348 --> 05:16.817
and I was so mesmerized

05:16.817 --> 05:19.052
that something so simple
could create that image.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.121
And he started talking
about the problems with it,

05:21.121 --> 05:22.656
that it doesn't work very well.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.358
So I spent four years tinkering
in my garage to make a design

05:25.358 --> 05:26.993
that was something
that was way better

05:26.993 --> 05:28.728
than one that's
ever been before.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.530
Then I went from
the inventor in my garage

05:30.530 --> 05:32.732
to the entrepreneur
trying to sell this thing,

05:32.732 --> 05:35.235

in like 2010.

for you, Les?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.059
Well,
YouTube is really good

06:33.059 --> 06:34.694
because people
who are going on YouTube

06:34.694 --> 06:36.796
and they're gonna watch
a drawing tutorial --

06:36.796 --> 06:39.566
Right, so they're typing in
"how to learn to draw"...

06:39.566 --> 06:40.667
Exactly, yeah.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.435
How much are you spending
on advertising?

06:42.435 --> 06:43.770
Last year was a big year.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.972
We did about $70,000 a month
in advertising.
Wow.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.341
From watching "Shark Tank,"
every time I saw an entrepreneur

06:48.341 --> 06:49.509
coming in
with these awesome numbers,

06:49.509 --> 06:51.945
they said social media
was what was driving it.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.347
And so I sat down and actually
spent hours watching videos,

06:54.347 --> 06:55.649
learned how to do it.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
So then advertising
started taking off.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.786
In 2018 when I did that --
$1 million.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.088
2019 -- $1.9 million.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.624
Then, of course,
$3.7 million in 2020.
Herjavec: Wow.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.259
But, Les, why do you need
the money?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.128
You made $1.6 million.
Oh, yes.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.697
I'm here for a Shark.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.165
Our biggest pain point
right now

07:12.165 --> 07:14.668
that I think a Shark can help us
with is cost per acquisition.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.804
Look, it's a challenge because
the customer acquisition --

07:17.804 --> 07:19.539
you have to find
a subset of people

07:19.539 --> 07:22.609
that would use a tool,
that want to draw, right?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.812
So whatever your customer
acquisition costs are now --

07:25.812 --> 07:27.147
and what are they?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.481
It's about $48 on average
for the year.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.451
Okay, and your margin
when you sell one unit is what?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.853
Costs us $25.
We're selling it for like $130.

07:33.853 --> 07:37.524
So you're basically
over $100 with a profit,

07:37.524 --> 07:40.527
so you're giving up half your
profit to acquire the customer.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.828
So now I understand
your problem.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.097
You want to get that --
every dollar you can reduce

07:44.097 --> 07:46.333
in your customer acquisition
goes straight to your pocket.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.768
So this is really about
driving sales

07:48.768 --> 07:51.338
through customer acquisition,
that's it.
Yes.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.939
Cuban:
So let me step in.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.108
Congratulations on what
you've been able to accomplish,

07:55.108 --> 07:57.610
but this is not a product
that gets me excited at all.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.013
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.182
Okay, I'm sorry to hear that,
but I got into a little bit

08:02.182 --> 08:04.451
about what I want a partnership

Tell us that --

17:27.213 --> 17:29.916
So, I was a recent college grad.
I got a degree in economics.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.118
And I took the summer off
just to do dog sports.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.319
I was doing dog agility.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.054
I discovered the sport
of lure coursing.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.657
Wait, what's it called?
It's called lure coursing.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.958

-Lure coursing.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.326

17:40.326 --> 17:43.696
Actually, this got started
with a little dog named Pretzel,

17:43.696 --> 17:45.698
and I lost Pretzel in May.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.033
-Aw, I'm sorry.
-What happened?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.402
He was 14 1/2.
I lost him to kidney disease.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.470
There he is.
Oh, so cute.

Cuban:
He looks like a pretzel.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.207

hard for me because that dog --

17:55.207 --> 17:57.076
he was my sidekick.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.811
He had a great, long life.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.580
[ Normal voice ] He didn't
really like to play with toys,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.615
but he loved chasing stuff.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.017
Is Piper your dog, too?
So, Piper's my dog.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.886
I got Piper a couple
of years ago.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.487
Meghan, take us through
the progression, like --

18:08.487 --> 18:11.157
Absolutely. So we got our start
making pro-grade equipment.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.491
The equipment out there
that people would build --

18:12.491 --> 18:14.527
And when did you start
doing this?
In 2012.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.529
I built my first one
with the help of my dad.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.763
My dog loved it.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.465
I invited my agility friends.
They loved it.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.001
I actually --
How big is
the agility sport?

18:22.001 --> 18:24.437
Hundreds of thousands
of entries

18:24.437 --> 18:27.506
in thousands of competitions
every year.
Come on!

18:27.506 --> 18:29.542
I built professional-grade
equipment.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.179
We filed for our patent,
and then in about 2017,

18:33.179 --> 18:34.547
we were going around
the country

18:34.547 --> 18:37.683
selling this to zoos,
dog trainers, doggie day cares,

18:37.683 --> 18:39.719
and then everybody
who would come to these events.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.922
Average dog owners would say,
"I need this in my backyard."

18:42.922 --> 18:45.791
So I couldn't let it go.
I said, "I have to make one,"

18:45.791 --> 18:50.630
because the pro-grade equipment
costs over $2,500.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.964
And that's just not affordable.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.368
So then we launched this
with a Kickstarter in 2018.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.704
We shipped our first units
in 2019.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.072
So what are sales now?

19:00.072 --> 19:02.041
So I want to get to sales.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.743
I don't want to
leave you guys hanging.

19:03.743 --> 19:07.546
So I ended up doing
a seed round in 2020.
Ah.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.081
And I did that
on a convertible note,

19:09.081 --> 19:10.883
$2.5 million cap.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.618
I raised $670,000.

Let me tell you why --
we actually didn't get back

20:00.199 --> 20:02.334
in stock until June,
and that was because

20:02.334 --> 20:04.637
of materials delays
early in the year.

20:04.637 --> 20:09.175
And then we did $425,000
from June to December last year.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.342
But you lost $380,000.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.044
That means
you kept the staff on.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.215

-Where did the cash go?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.994

was materials.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.264
So we buy all of our materials.
We bring them into my hometown.

in my hometown.

25:25.657 --> 25:28.093
I'm in a meeting.
Don't come in.

25:28.093 --> 25:30.662
What?! I <i>can't</i> come in.
The door is locked!

25:30.662 --> 25:32.498
[ Laughter ]

25:32.498 --> 25:34.633
It's unlocked.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.702
Hi. I'm Steve's teammate,
Connor.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.872
Sharks, this is why
we invented BusyBox,

25:39.872 --> 25:42.107
the first data sign made

25:42.107 --> 25:43.942
for work-from-home
professionals.

25:43.942 --> 25:47.212
To use it, you simply
mount it on your door.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.781
You connect it
to our app.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.250
And you can change
the lighting and brightness

25:51.250 --> 25:53.519
and even connect it
to your calendar

25:53.519 --> 25:55.354
so it automatically
lets people know

25:55.354 --> 25:58.957
when you're off
that five-hour marathon call.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.926
And with
the BusyBox Digital,

26:00.926 --> 26:04.096
you can create any message
you want using our HD screen.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.265
So the options
are unlimited.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.399
That's right, Sharks.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.868
Who wants to be
more productive at home

26:09.868 --> 26:12.104
and help us build a brand

26:12.104 --> 26:14.173
for work-from-home
professionals?

26:14.173 --> 26:15.174
Shahks!

26:15.174 --> 26:17.810
Both:
Who wants to get busy?!

26:17.810 --> 26:19.344
-Shahks!
-Shahks!

26:19.344 --> 26:20.813
I love that. Shahks!

26:20.813 --> 26:24.083
So we put some BusyBoxes there
in front of you and phones.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.351
And we'd love to have you
dive in and play.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.420
There are
two models there --

26:28.420 --> 26:29.988
the standard
and the digital.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.157
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

26:32.157 --> 26:35.461
We made everyone
a special assortment of presets

26:35.461 --> 26:36.695
so you could have
some fun there.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.031
Oh!
Oh, there we go!

26:39.031 --> 26:40.399
-I did it.
-I got it!

26:40.399 --> 26:43.435
So the digital
is our more expensive model.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.537
So this, you have to go
with whatever is there.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.772
Yeah, exactly.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.674
So with that model,
to keep the cost down,

26:48.674 --> 26:50.209
we have slide-in-and-out
signs.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.411
So you can see everyone
has a few different signs.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.946
-Got it.
-How much does it cost?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.982
That model there
is $299.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.951
Wait, I'm sorry.
$299?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.319
-Yes, sir.
-Wow.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.754
Why are you charging $299
for it?

27:02.754 --> 27:03.789
I'm curious.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.758
We want to grow slow
and methodical,

27:06.758 --> 27:08.594
and we want to have margin
to make sure

27:08.594 --> 27:11.330
that we have great features
that we can build

27:11.330 --> 27:13.232
and connect
with customers.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.199
So what are your sales?

27:14.199 --> 27:16.735
So we have
lifetime sales

27:16.735 --> 27:19.238
of $429,000.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.006
We did $299,000
in 2020.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.008
We did $129,000
so far.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.776
-Not bad, though, hey.
-Yeah, I'm surprised.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.211
You know what?
You're not full of crap.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.013
You guys have gotten a lot
of press for this, haven't you?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.782
No, none.
No? 'Cause I've seen
something very similar.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.519
There are people making
similar devices,

27:33.519 --> 27:35.654
but they're made
for sitting on your desk.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.322
They're made to look at.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.825
We're going after
the work-from-home market

27:39.825 --> 27:42.327
where we want to put this
on the outside of the door.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.029
Now, are you two related?

27:44.029 --> 27:45.364
[ Laughs ] No.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.798
So why don't you tell us
about you,

27:46.798 --> 27:49.268
what each of you do,
and how you two got together?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.570
I came up with the idea
at the start of the pandemic.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.305
I'm sitting there
on a video call.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.474
My wife comes in
and says, "Hey,"

27:55.474 --> 27:56.808
and she walks in
and she's like,

27:56.808 --> 27:59.344
"Oh, I feel bad. Sorry."
Turns and walks out.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.047
A little while later,
my daughter does the same thing.

28:02.047 --> 28:05.284
And I'm like, "Agh!
This is crazy."

28:05.284 --> 28:06.652
So I was like,
oh, you know what?

28:06.652 --> 28:09.454
One of those old
on-air signs.

28:09.454 --> 28:13.058
And what I'll do is
I'll just mount that on my door

28:13.058 --> 28:14.560
and away I go.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.994
Guess what?
What?

28:15.994 --> 28:17.829
None exists.
Nothing.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.298
Really?
You can buy -- Yeah.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.499
I was about to say to you,

28:20.499 --> 28:22.568
can't you just go get a light
or a something --

28:22.568 --> 28:24.002
Yeah, I would think
they're everywhere.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.472
So the hard-wired lights --
no problem.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.575
If you want to cut a hole
in the wall,

28:29.575 --> 28:31.677
run electrical wire...
Right.

28:31.677 --> 28:34.279
...add a switch,
absolutely.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.415
So I come up
with this product idea

28:36.415 --> 28:39.351
and I go, "I'm gonna build
a nice little business here."

28:39.351 --> 28:42.020
But then along the way,
I started to realize

28:42.020 --> 28:44.122
that there's a big
market opportunity

28:44.122 --> 28:46.592
beyond just data signs.

28:46.592 --> 28:47.926
What's the opportunity?

28:47.926 --> 28:50.395
We're looking
for building

28:50.395 --> 28:52.431
productivity products
like the BusyBox

28:52.431 --> 28:54.766
that helps you to be
more productive in that space

28:54.766 --> 28:56.101
that you call
your busy space --

28:56.101 --> 28:57.469
things that help you
communicate.

28:57.469 --> 29:01.440
So, your microphone,
your video camera.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.841
The lights in your room

29:02.841 --> 29:05.577
could know what you're doing
and adjust.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.380
We want to bring wellness
into it as well.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.082
Oy. Okay, let me
get things started.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.017
Look, guys, you've certainly
put in the effort,

29:12.017 --> 29:14.253
so I give you credit there,

29:14.253 --> 29:17.155
but you're going off
on <i>all</i> these tangents,

29:17.155 --> 29:21.960
and whenever something evolves
to the wellness space,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.863
I'm out.
Okay. I understand.

29:24.863 --> 29:28.533
My feeling is it's cute.
It's novel. I see the need.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.702
But $299 for it

29:30.702 --> 29:33.171
I think is just <i>way</i> too high
a price point.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.173
I just think that
it's never...
Right.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.209
...going to really
become something

29:37.209 --> 29:40.579
in a <i>lot</i> of households.
Yes. Right.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.981
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:42.981 --> 29:44.182
Thank you.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.918
Look, I think
you guys hit a trend.

29:46.918 --> 29:50.055
Your next idea, wellness --

29:50.055 --> 29:53.158
it's a little reaching
for me.
Sure.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.193
I admire the fact
you started something,

29:55.193 --> 29:56.828
and you should be proud
of that.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.598
But as an investor,
I'm...

29:59.598 --> 30:01.400
Sorry to hear that.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.835
Thank you for supporting
entrepreneurship as well.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.038
The weird thing about all this
is there's probably

30:06.038 --> 30:07.539
a market for this thing.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.675
I wish both of you the best.
Congratulations.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.209
You made it to "Shark Tank."
Good luck to you.

I'm out.
Okay.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.214

where it's going

30:16.214 --> 30:19.017
at a price that is just
not comprehensible

30:19.017 --> 30:22.254
to the everyday person
for you to scale.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.957
It's not investable for me
at the moment, so I'm out.

Hi.
My name is Shahira Marei.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.036
I'm from Orange County,
California.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.871
I'm seeking $500,000

-Whoa!
-Ooh.
-Wow.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.378
Sharks, aren't you tired of
sending the same fruit baskets,

31:19.378 --> 31:21.847
cookies, and cupcakes
to all your friends and family?

31:21.847 --> 31:24.149
The edible gifting space
is impersonal

31:24.149 --> 31:26.418
and hasn't had much change
since 1960

31:26.418 --> 31:28.787
with the addition of
chocolate-covered strawberries.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.655
That's why we created
Dirty Cookie,

31:30.655 --> 31:32.958
a unique, delicious,
and memorable gift.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.426
The cookie shot glass --

31:34.426 --> 31:37.729
yep, we've taken shot glasses
and turned them into cookies,

31:37.729 --> 31:39.364
and they may look like
hard cookies to you,

31:39.364 --> 31:41.633
but they're actually
super soft and chewy,

31:41.633 --> 31:44.002
turned into edible shot glasses
that you can fill

31:44.002 --> 31:47.305
with any beverage, from milk,
coffee, sweet liqueur,

31:47.305 --> 31:49.975
or my personal favorite,
chocolate ice cream.

31:49.975 --> 31:54.579
We have DIY decorating kits
and gift boxes for any occasion,

31:54.579 --> 31:57.182
from birthdays,
graduations, showers.

31:57.182 --> 32:00.085
We even have vegan, gluten-free
options for you, too.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.587
All right, Sharks,
who's ready to talk cookie to me

32:02.587 --> 32:04.423
and take a shot
with Dirty Cookie?

32:04.423 --> 32:05.857
What do we have here,

32:05.857 --> 32:07.726
So you have our chocolate chip,

double chocolate.

Ooh!
Tastes great.
Thank you.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.701
Oh, I love
the double chocolate.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.337
So the idea is I sip
and then I bite into it.

32:19.337 --> 32:22.274
Yes, so instead of, like,
dunking your cookies in milk,

32:22.274 --> 32:23.842
you drink your milk
out of your cookie.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.243
And we customize them.
Oh.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.245
You can see some of them
have logos.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.547
Greiner: Wow.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.248
Okay.
What's the story here?

32:30.248 --> 32:32.083
Well, my family moved here
from Egypt

32:32.083 --> 32:33.385
when I was five years old.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.686
I got a job at Boeing.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.388
I was the youngest
female project manager,

32:36.388 --> 32:38.824
managing $20 million
worth of projects.
Wow.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.660
And then three years later,
I had my daughter.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.129
And that was also
a pivotal moment in my life

32:44.129 --> 32:47.065
because I realized, okay,
I have an amazing corporate job,

32:47.065 --> 32:48.533
but I don't have
my dream business.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.569
I've always wanted a business
since I was like 10 years old.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.504
How did you create
the idea to do it?

32:52.504 --> 32:55.307
So I was inspired a lot
by Pinterest, to be honest.

32:55.307 --> 32:59.945
So I saw a lady
molding cookie dough on a bowl.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.580
And I love milk and cookies,

33:01.580 --> 33:04.216
so when I saw her doing that,
I called my engineer at Boeing.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.383
Me and him got together.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.319
We designed and manufactured
our own molds.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.820
We actually have a patent
on the mold.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.988
What do you charge for them,
Shahira?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.523
We never heard
what they cost.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.291
The dozen is $49.99.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.894
It costs us $12.92
per dozen.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.263
And you were saying that
they are customizable.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.364
How does that work?

33:19.364 --> 33:21.967
So these are our DIY kits
for any occasion,

33:21.967 --> 33:24.236
for, like, Christmas
or Hanukkah.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.770
Kids or parents put them on.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.239
We send them chocolate,
sprinkles...

33:27.239 --> 33:28.707
Oh, cute.
...and they decorate them
themselves.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.308
And when did you
start the business?

33:30.308 --> 33:32.043
Yeah, so I started
in brick-and-mortar

33:32.043 --> 33:34.012
for three years in 2015.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.847
It was a terrible location.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.517
I realized really quickly within
a year I wanted to get out,

33:38.517 --> 33:40.519
but I didn't close it
till 2018.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.487
What was the 2018 sales?

33:42.487 --> 33:45.190
So 2018 was about
$300,000.
Okay.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.958
2019 was about $345,000.
