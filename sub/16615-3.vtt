could walk out that door

and I can't give that to him.

happiness is an illusion.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.710
Hey.

11:28.839 --> 11:30.870
We will find a way to
defeat the Evil Queen.

11:30.938 --> 11:33.106
- We always do.
- Is this our life now...

11:33.528 --> 11:35.041
just defeat and repeat?

11:35.915 --> 11:39.416
I just want things to be normal someday.

11:39.441 --> 11:41.180
What does normal even look like?

11:41.282 --> 11:43.270
Well... [Chuckles] it might sound crazy,

11:43.295 --> 11:45.695
but for 28 years, things were normal.

11:45.936 --> 11:47.168
When we were cursed?

11:47.193 --> 11:49.126
- There was a downside.
- [Chuckles]

11:51.099 --> 11:52.635
I liked teaching.

11:53.070 --> 11:54.047
That was Mary Margaret.

11:54.072 --> 11:55.955
And why can't a princess be a teacher?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.313
What's more noble than that?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.100
I'd like to teach again. Is that crazy?

12:01.569 --> 12:03.402
That...

12:04.277 --> 12:07.907
is the most normal thing
I've heard in a long time.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.720
What?

12:20.788 --> 12:22.955
I think I have a way to help Jekyll.

12:25.099 --> 12:26.198
Oh. [Chuckles]

12:26.360 --> 12:27.827
Swan, see that parry?

12:27.929 --> 12:29.305
Think he's finally
getting the hang of it.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.363
Uh, yeah. What are
you doing here, Henry?

12:31.923 --> 12:33.466
Hook told me you two
were going to find Ashley.

12:33.534 --> 12:35.551
- I thought I could help.
- Was this your idea?

12:35.576 --> 12:36.897
Some sort of a weird

12:36.922 --> 12:38.681
"pirate teaches him
how to be a man" thing?

12:38.706 --> 12:40.706
No, this was all his
idea. He said it was a...

12:40.731 --> 12:42.118
well, what did you call it?

12:42.143 --> 12:44.562
- Mother-son bonding.
- Ah, yes.

12:44.587 --> 12:48.247
All right. Operation Cobra Part Two.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.683
Every shoe belongs to a foot.

12:50.785 --> 12:53.085
And this one will take us right to her.

13:01.529 --> 13:03.496
[Indistinct conversations]

13:04.599 --> 13:07.867
Look at this, Gus. Isn't it amazing?

13:07.902 --> 13:11.137
Whatever I owe Rumplestiltskin
for, it is worth it.

13:11.593 --> 13:12.625
I hope so.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.218
I've heard other mice tell
terrible tales about him.

13:15.243 --> 13:16.609
Well...

13:17.078 --> 13:18.778
whatever else he might be,

13:18.813 --> 13:22.515
for tonight, he's my fairy godmother.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.950
Father. [Laughing] Whatever.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.053
Thanks to him, I have this dress,

13:28.122 --> 13:29.488
glass slippers...

13:29.513 --> 13:32.280
and all... this.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.938
It's free cheese.

13:35.963 --> 13:38.831
Go. [Laughing] Have fun.

13:45.337 --> 13:46.436
- [Gasps]
- Oh!

13:46.474 --> 13:48.384
I am so sorry! Did I tear your dress?

13:48.409 --> 13:49.652
If I did, I'll sew it up myself!

13:49.677 --> 13:51.544
It's okay. Really, it's okay.

13:51.898 --> 13:52.855
I'm Snow White.

13:53.498 --> 13:54.395
Ella.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.648
Nice to meet you, Ella.

13:55.716 --> 13:57.483
I feel terrible about your dress.

13:57.552 --> 14:00.413
Don't. I stopped worrying
about dresses a long time ago.

14:00.562 --> 14:03.432
I'm not your typical princess.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.384
But I get the feeling neither are you.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.837
Oh, no, I'm not. I'm
not a princess at all.

14:07.862 --> 14:10.896
I'm just an ordinary girl
playing dress-up for a night.

14:10.965 --> 14:12.364
Well, I don't think you're ordinary.

14:14.357 --> 14:16.883
And apparently, neither does he.

14:18.573 --> 14:20.671
Is that...? The Prince.

14:20.696 --> 14:23.342
Don't worry. They're not
all as stuffy as you think.

14:23.438 --> 14:25.019
You think he could be charming?

14:25.044 --> 14:28.406
Oh, that name's taken. [Whispering] Go.

14:39.367 --> 14:42.194
It appears Princess Snow
wants us to converse.

14:42.263 --> 14:44.396
- Yeah, she thought you were...
- Staring?

14:44.644 --> 14:45.808
Was it that obvious?

14:45.833 --> 14:46.866
[Both chuckle]

14:47.073 --> 14:48.311
Then I apologize.

14:48.336 --> 14:50.336
But I could tell there was
something different about you,

14:50.659 --> 14:53.072
and that was before I saw
those glass shoes of yours.

14:53.174 --> 14:54.440
Wherever did you get them?

14:54.542 --> 14:56.442
You wouldn't believe me if I told.

14:56.654 --> 14:59.011
A girl with mystery. I like that.

14:59.036 --> 15:01.271
- [Chuckles]
- But can you dance in them?

15:01.582 --> 15:03.148
I can try.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.191
Would it be too bold
if I asked your name?

15:12.260 --> 15:14.260
I thought you liked a mystery.

15:16.269 --> 15:18.088
Then a mystery it shall be.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.013
The girl with the glass slippers.

15:25.232 --> 15:26.974
You're not from this world, are you?

15:26.999 --> 15:29.041
Is that bad?

15:29.630 --> 15:30.780
It's wonderful.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.038
[Giggles]

15:37.516 --> 15:38.561
If you'll excuse me,

15:38.586 --> 15:42.955
I have a quick piece of
business, but I'll return.

15:43.352 --> 15:45.518
Don't go anywhere.

16:06.047 --> 16:07.546
[Speaking indistinctly]

16:07.581 --> 16:09.048
[Laughs]

16:09.150 --> 16:11.666
Oh. Thank you.

16:11.691 --> 16:13.384
I'm so excited.

16:13.946 --> 16:16.132
Do you know who they're laughing at?

16:16.298 --> 16:17.697
They're laughing at you.

16:18.793 --> 16:21.593
Do you really think he
would choose you over her?

16:24.028 --> 16:25.003
But he...

16:25.028 --> 16:26.320
but he danced with me.

16:26.345 --> 16:28.912
He was making fun of you, dear.

16:29.234 --> 16:31.195
You're so obviously a serving girl.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.706
Look at that garish blue dress.

16:33.906 --> 16:35.539
He made you into a joke.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.595
And everyone here knew it.

16:38.923 --> 16:40.389
Except you.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.463
[Bell jingles]

16:59.850 --> 17:01.600
Hello, Sheriff.

17:01.864 --> 17:04.502
Thought you would be
on patrol right now.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.516
Where'd you get this?

17:09.106 --> 17:10.872
This was my father's coin.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.979
I need to know if his death
was really an accident.

17:14.092 --> 17:16.577
So, what do you say

17:16.602 --> 17:19.284
we skip right to the part
where you offer me a deal?

17:19.440 --> 17:22.207
Well, I do like candor.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.276
Almost as much as I like deals.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.578
So...

17:26.680 --> 17:30.415
yes, the coin was mine for a time.

17:31.127 --> 17:33.086
And lucky for you...

17:33.757 --> 17:35.855
I'm a stickler for records.

17:37.025 --> 17:39.559
Here we are.

17:40.657 --> 17:41.523
Name your price.

17:41.548 --> 17:42.862
Now you're talking.

17:43.142 --> 17:44.630
But I must warn you,

17:44.699 --> 17:46.645
the more desperate the
man, the higher the price,

17:46.670 --> 17:49.437
and you seem... quite desperate.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.702
So I'll have to ask you.

17:53.026 --> 17:55.826
How badly do you want a deal?

18:03.394 --> 18:05.827
[Gus squeaks]

18:05.888 --> 18:08.155
Gus, what are you doing?

18:10.845 --> 18:13.861
Right! Mother's key.

18:13.963 --> 18:15.996
She said it was magic.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.566
Maybe...

18:30.479 --> 18:32.346
[Whooshing]

18:37.653 --> 18:39.330
What are you doing?

18:39.361 --> 18:40.627
I'm leaving.

18:41.265 --> 18:42.364
No!

18:43.859 --> 18:45.052
You can't leave.

18:45.077 --> 18:46.067
What do you care?!

18:46.092 --> 18:48.011
When you marry the Prince,
you won't need me anymore.

18:48.036 --> 18:50.181
No, no, no, you have got this all wrong.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.368
- The Prince loves <i> you.</i>
- What?

18:53.487 --> 18:55.532
You're the girl in the glass slipper.

18:55.557 --> 18:56.704
He's out there right now

18:56.729 --> 18:58.762
searching the entire
kingdom for <i> you.</i>

18:59.814 --> 19:01.176
You're making fun of me again.

19:01.414 --> 19:03.113
I saw him give you that rose.

19:03.138 --> 19:05.870
It's because I'm getting married,

19:06.182 --> 19:07.815
but not to the Prince.

19:08.346 --> 19:10.908
To his footman, Jacob.

19:11.514 --> 19:13.762
The Prince was only
passing along a message.

19:13.787 --> 19:15.190
The footman?

19:15.599 --> 19:18.549
But... you were so cruel to him.

19:20.032 --> 19:23.233
Mother would never
let me marry a footman.

19:24.555 --> 19:26.167
And so I...

19:26.512 --> 19:28.826
put on an act.

19:29.348 --> 19:31.548
Like I've done most of my life.

19:34.405 --> 19:37.368
I am so sorry, Ella.

19:37.852 --> 19:39.058
For everything.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.350
But we have both been her prisoner.

19:42.809 --> 19:46.378
And tonight, I can finally escape.

19:48.519 --> 19:50.085
Where are you going?

19:51.085 --> 19:51.972
I'm going to meet Jacob

19:51.997 --> 19:53.935
at the guard tower at
the Prince's castle,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.774
and we are gonna ride far away

19:56.799 --> 19:59.233
- and start a little farm together.
- [Chuckles]

19:59.383 --> 20:02.560
And I am never coming back.

20:03.519 --> 20:06.397
You know your mother will
hunt you down wherever you go.

20:08.136 --> 20:09.901
I have an idea.

20:18.424 --> 20:19.969
Ashley! What are you doing?!

20:19.994 --> 20:20.855
Go away!

20:21.657 --> 20:23.499
We're your friends. Why
are you threatening us?

20:23.644 --> 20:25.026
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

20:25.605 --> 20:27.869
There's just something I have to
do just as soon as I figure out

20:27.894 --> 20:29.420
where my sister's hidden herself.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.727
- We cannot let you hurt her.
- Hurt her?

20:31.752 --> 20:33.814
No, you've got it all wrong.
I'm not trying to hurt Clorinda.

20:33.839 --> 20:35.601
I'm trying to <i> help</i> her.

20:35.626 --> 20:37.705
Why? She's your wicked stepsister.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.303
You don't know the real story.

20:39.328 --> 20:41.929
In the end, Clorinda
wasn't the wicked sister.

20:42.690 --> 20:43.897
I was.

20:46.795 --> 20:49.317
So you did something bad.
We've done a lot of bad things.

20:49.342 --> 20:51.475
A long time ago, I told you if
people saw you a certain way,

20:51.544 --> 20:53.344
you had to punch back
and show them who you are.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.232
If you see yourself a certain way,

20:55.257 --> 20:57.081
punch back and see yourself differently.

20:57.483 --> 20:59.283
You can change. You can fix this.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.319
Whatever it is, I will help you.

21:02.523 --> 21:03.688
No, but that's the thing.

21:03.870 --> 21:06.057
You just said it. <i>I</i>
have to throw the punch.

21:06.159 --> 21:07.543
That's why I came out here alone.

21:07.568 --> 21:09.724
You can't do it for me this time.

21:09.749 --> 21:11.167
Do you know how it feels

21:11.192 --> 21:13.692
when you know all your
happiness is a lie?

21:14.901 --> 21:17.635
Yeah. I do.

21:21.274 --> 21:22.406
Swan?

21:22.982 --> 21:25.416
Swan, stop her! Use your magic!

21:26.694 --> 21:27.562
I can't.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.091
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

21:30.116 --> 21:31.148
Hey.

21:31.506 --> 21:33.217
It's okay.

21:34.827 --> 21:38.022
I just need to know if
the Evil Queen was here.

21:38.124 --> 21:41.325
Shh! You're gonna wake Robin.

21:43.196 --> 21:44.072
That rattle.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.664
[Robin coos]

21:46.802 --> 21:48.768
She <i> was</i> here!

21:48.801 --> 21:50.434
[Sighs]

21:50.901 --> 21:53.452
Okay, fine. She was here.

21:53.477 --> 21:54.772
Well, you have to give that back.

21:55.634 --> 21:57.015
Our mother's rattle?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.376
The only family heirloom I have?

21:59.401 --> 22:00.778
There are strings attached.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.280
I'm a big girl.

22:03.426 --> 22:04.878
Stop judging me.

22:04.903 --> 22:07.634
I'm not trying to judge
you. I am trying to save you.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.725
Save <i> me?</i>

22:09.134 --> 22:11.088
You're the one that
needed saving so badly,

22:11.113 --> 22:14.048
you ripped yourself in half.

22:14.617 --> 22:17.384
So if you're gonna blame
anyone here, blame yourself.

22:20.134 --> 22:21.298
It's still happening.

22:21.898 --> 22:23.167
I thought the Cricket was helping you.

22:23.269 --> 22:25.269
I thought so, too.

22:25.964 --> 22:28.839
Having a little trouble with your magic?

22:28.864 --> 22:30.420
Stay away from my mom.

22:30.445 --> 22:34.645
Henry. Now, is that any way to
speak to your <i> real</i> mother?

22:34.791 --> 22:35.890
You're not my mother.

22:35.915 --> 22:37.915
Well, sure I am. I raised you.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.676
I helped you with your
homework. I packed your lunches.

22:40.701 --> 22:42.363
Regina and I may have split,

22:42.388 --> 22:45.823
but I am as much your mother as she is.

22:46.227 --> 22:47.925
Now stop slouching.

22:48.321 --> 22:51.480
Posture is self-respect,
and if you don't have it,

22:51.505 --> 22:52.977
no one else will give it to you.

22:53.002 --> 22:55.408
Henry, hey. Don't listen to her.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.601
Says the woman who was never around.

22:58.533 --> 23:01.238
You're right. I was never
around, and I owned that.

23:01.559 --> 23:03.107
You're just the worst part of Regina.

23:03.132 --> 23:07.958
Am I? Or am I the part
that is honest about myself?

23:07.983 --> 23:10.014
You see, Regina never
had her happy ending

23:10.082 --> 23:12.349
because she's never been strong enough

23:12.451 --> 23:15.152
to let her story run its course.

23:15.221 --> 23:18.889
I won't make that mistake,
mnh-mnh, for myself...

23:19.782 --> 23:21.058
or our new arrivals.

23:21.127 --> 23:23.591
What about those people?
What do you want with them?

23:23.616 --> 23:24.862
Patience.

23:25.381 --> 23:29.396
You just wait until those
untold stories play out.

23:29.421 --> 23:30.901
But here's a little spoiler.

23:30.970 --> 23:33.838
Cinderella's story won't end well.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.306
Why would you want to hurt Ashley?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.798
I don't. I want to hurt <i> you.</i>

23:38.504 --> 23:41.912
I want you to see how pointless you are.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.848
I saved her once. I'll save her again.

23:43.873 --> 23:48.008
Oh, that's the tragic
thing about being a savior.

23:48.310 --> 23:50.210
You have to keep saving people.

23:50.812 --> 23:53.713
But once you're off the chessboard...

23:55.145 --> 23:57.440
everything falls apart.

23:57.620 --> 24:01.205
All those happy endings turn to dust,

24:01.300 --> 24:04.335
and your entire life means...

24:04.733 --> 24:05.832
nothing.

24:06.020 --> 24:08.187
Let me show you what it feels like.

24:12.345 --> 24:13.777
[Laughs]

24:18.291 --> 24:19.924
Where the hell are we?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.363
She took us off the chessboard.

24:26.684 --> 24:27.732
_

24:29.964 --> 24:31.132
[Knock on door]

24:31.388 --> 24:32.182
[Chuckles]

24:32.207 --> 24:34.560
David, hi. Come in.

24:35.303 --> 24:36.476
Do you, uh... want to sit down?

24:36.501 --> 24:38.501
Oh, no, no, no, no,
thanks. I'll... I'll stand.

24:38.592 --> 24:40.627
What, uh... what brings you here?

24:40.652 --> 24:41.784
Nothing much.

24:43.377 --> 24:44.777
I have something for you.

24:45.081 --> 24:46.347
From your husband.

24:47.934 --> 24:49.434
I have no idea what it says.

24:49.459 --> 24:52.760
I'm just the messenger.

24:53.344 --> 24:55.311
You? A messenger?

24:56.881 --> 24:58.517
What did you need from him?

24:59.769 --> 25:02.513
He has information about my father.

25:02.878 --> 25:03.748
About his death.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.618
And you had to make a deal to get it?

25:06.643 --> 25:08.176
Sounds like my husband.

25:11.059 --> 25:14.258
There. You can, uh...
you can say I took it.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.426
And I'm sorry.

25:15.451 --> 25:17.184
I'm sure it must not have been easy

25:17.209 --> 25:19.340
- growing up without your father.
- It was.

25:19.365 --> 25:21.966
Of course, it wasn't easy
when he was there, either.

25:22.068 --> 25:24.245
Drunk and sad. [Chuckles]

25:24.270 --> 25:28.338
Mm. I guess it's hard to say
which is worse for some fathers.

25:31.244 --> 25:33.377
Gone.

25:33.446 --> 25:35.246
It was worse having him gone.

25:37.784 --> 25:39.750
Fathers and sons.

25:40.954 --> 25:42.747
It's hard for you, I think.

25:42.772 --> 25:44.672
'Cause no matter what the
damage to the relationship,

25:45.058 --> 25:47.024
you need each other.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.660
Hmm.

25:49.762 --> 25:50.950
Ashley was my first save.

25:50.975 --> 25:52.741
You take that away, then what?

25:53.066 --> 25:54.600
Everything I've done can be undone?

25:54.625 --> 25:57.726
By the Evil Queen? No, no, no.
My Emma's too strong for that.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.604
Look, we can worry about
the big picture later.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.296
Right now the little picture's saying

26:01.321 --> 26:03.287
that we have to go, magic or no magic.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.611
Go where? Back to where Ashley
left us? She's not there.

26:05.636 --> 26:07.102
She's charging into who knows what,

26:07.137 --> 26:09.404
and if the Evil Queen wants
it to play out, it's not good.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.006
Then we figure out
where she's headed next.

26:11.075 --> 26:14.376
You didn't used to have
magic and you found people.

26:14.445 --> 26:16.973
He's right. Just imagine that
you're back in your old life

26:16.998 --> 26:19.175
as a bails bonds-person... woman.

26:19.503 --> 26:21.203
How did you find people then?

26:23.187 --> 26:24.653
Try to think like the skip thinks

26:24.678 --> 26:26.644
and get inside their head.

26:26.824 --> 26:28.323
Why are they running?

26:28.805 --> 26:30.366
What is their story? Who do they love?

26:30.391 --> 26:31.890
Henry: Their story.

26:32.262 --> 26:34.229
Ashley said she was trying
to help her stepsister,

26:34.298 --> 26:35.764
uh, Camilla?

26:36.048 --> 26:36.832
Calinda?

26:36.934 --> 26:38.310
- Ca... uh.
- Calinda.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.504
- Callista.
- I thought it was Calinda.

26:39.529 --> 26:41.666
It's Clorinda. Ashley blames herself

26:41.691 --> 26:43.138
for her not getting her happy ending.

26:43.163 --> 26:45.863
If the book says what her
ending was supposed to be,

26:46.009 --> 26:48.143
then that's a clue we need.

26:49.379 --> 26:52.581
Yes! It's in here. Look.

26:53.283 --> 26:56.318
Lady Tremaine: Clorinda, where are you?

26:56.980 --> 26:58.246
What's going on?

26:58.573 --> 26:59.792
Clorinda.

26:59.817 --> 27:01.683
She's run off with the footman!

27:02.307 --> 27:03.291
[Slams cane]

27:03.725 --> 27:05.127
I-I don't know where she's gone,

27:05.195 --> 27:08.209
but... but maybe it won't matter.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.260
The Prince is looking
for me. He liked me.

27:11.285 --> 27:13.368
You know, maybe if I married well,

27:13.393 --> 27:14.709
Clorinda could do whatever she wanted.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.502
The Prince isn't gonna marry you.

27:17.112 --> 27:19.107
He isn't even gonna recognize you.

27:19.176 --> 27:21.376
- Of course he'll recognize me.
- Officially?

27:21.798 --> 27:25.614
Will the people
officially recognize you?

27:25.682 --> 27:29.317
You look like a trash bin and
have the education of my cat.

27:32.194 --> 27:36.024
Of course, if you had proof...

27:36.093 --> 27:39.027
it would be hard to deny you.

27:44.073 --> 27:46.501
Look what we have here.

27:46.537 --> 27:49.040
Okay. Okay. You want to know
where Clorinda is. I get it!

27:49.065 --> 27:51.483
But the shoe isn't that important.

27:51.508 --> 27:53.441
Oh, yes, it is.

27:53.736 --> 27:55.102
It's your proof.

27:56.048 --> 27:57.479
It's crucial.

27:57.721 --> 27:59.197
Now, where's my daughter?

Ashley: Clorinda.

28:28.712 --> 28:29.854
I've been searching everywhere,

28:29.879 --> 28:32.521
and then I realized you
might figure to come here.

28:35.267 --> 28:36.233
You're hurt.

28:38.322 --> 28:39.955
I am so sorry.

28:41.088 --> 28:42.539
This is all my fault,

28:42.564 --> 28:44.604
but I'm going to fix our story.

28:44.629 --> 28:47.563
I just hope that someday
you can forgive me.

28:50.706 --> 28:52.267
I can't.

28:52.437 --> 28:54.303
And neither can she.

I may be a princess,
but I know how to track.

This is where she came.

- I'm up here!
- [Gus squeaking]

30:08.318 --> 30:11.080
I'm so sorry about that,
and just... and everything.

30:11.105 --> 30:12.384
I never should've even come to the ball.

I didn't... I didn't
mean to mislead you.

there's... there's no proof,

and... and I totally
understand if your people

30:19.806 --> 30:20.848
want you to go with someone else...

30:20.873 --> 30:22.366
Why would they want someone else?

30:22.798 --> 30:24.464
Because I'm no one.

30:24.705 --> 30:26.038
Nonsense.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.884
Thank you, Princess Snow.

31:12.909 --> 31:14.509
Now, let's go to the palace.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.406
I'll wake the royal glass blower.

31:17.072 --> 31:18.182
You need new shoes.

31:18.207 --> 31:20.607
That sounds lovely.

31:22.488 --> 31:24.555
But there's something
I need to fix first.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.263
Jacob: A key? It's magic.

31:32.365 --> 31:36.000
It makes any door lead to
the Land of Untold Stories.

31:36.069 --> 31:40.238
It would pause our lives,
but we could be together.

31:41.227 --> 31:42.655
To the Land of Untold Stories.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.722
Mm-hmm.

- No! No! No!

"No"?

31:48.837 --> 31:49.836

Ella: Stop! Get away from her!

31:57.927 --> 31:59.190

31:59.292 --> 32:00.780
You told her where we'd be?

32:00.805 --> 32:02.705
You filthy little rat.

32:02.743 --> 32:03.943
I'm sorry, but look.

32:03.968 --> 32:05.601
Thomas found me. We're engaged.

32:07.977 --> 32:10.745
And you came here to what?
To rub it in our faces?

32:11.380 --> 32:12.803
No.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.706
This is so unfair.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.818
I've pulled myself through life

32:18.873 --> 32:21.607
for 50 years now,

32:22.003 --> 32:24.544
and every year I keep pulling,

32:24.959 --> 32:27.213
and when it's finally my turn to rest,

32:27.238 --> 32:30.572
this girl who I've carried like a...

32:30.643 --> 32:33.077
like a scab on my soul,

32:33.221 --> 32:36.556
she gets it all and I get nothing?

32:37.992 --> 32:39.926
No.

32:42.764 --> 32:44.330
Mother, what are you doing?

32:45.166 --> 32:46.933
I'm pausing.

32:47.134 --> 32:48.822
Perhaps when the world
makes sense again,

32:48.847 --> 32:51.114
I'll come back and
get what's owed to me.

32:51.746 --> 32:55.908
And you, my dear, you
are coming with me.

32:57.266 --> 33:00.500
The footman can find
someone at his own level.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.536
- Clorinda, listen to me.
- Quiet.

33:05.561 --> 33:07.012
I was trying to help you and Jacob

33:07.037 --> 33:09.185
find your happiness back
in the Enchanted Forest,

33:09.210 --> 33:11.210
and maybe you could get that here.

33:11.724 --> 33:14.534
Jacob? He's here?

33:14.562 --> 33:16.093
He's been in Storybrooke the whole time.

33:16.118 --> 33:19.866
Isn't... that why you
came here to his farm?

33:19.934 --> 33:21.555
Lady Tremaine: True enough.

33:21.665 --> 33:23.769
And here's the man himself.

33:24.911 --> 33:26.243
Jacob!

33:27.007 --> 33:29.542
This little patch of filth is his.

33:29.611 --> 33:33.446
See, I discovered my own
fairy godmother here...

33:33.677 --> 33:34.847
the Evil Queen.

33:35.224 --> 33:38.451
She's helping me find the
missing pieces of my betrayal.

33:38.519 --> 33:40.519
Time to finish an old job.

33:40.575 --> 33:41.974
Leave him alone!

33:43.059 --> 33:45.491

33:45.973 --> 33:47.960
- Stop, please.
- No.

33:48.234 --> 33:51.197
I wanted to be the one
taken care of for once.

33:51.538 --> 33:53.032
You're in pain.

33:53.101 --> 33:55.974
Okay? But you don't get to put
that off on Clorinda or Jacob!

33:55.999 --> 33:57.432
She's paid enough!

33:58.174 --> 33:59.273
Jacob: No!

34:00.105 --> 34:02.539
You really think I won't shoot you?

34:05.480 --> 34:07.509
I suppose you're right.

34:07.534 --> 34:10.135
This is a coward's weapon, anyway.

34:10.523 --> 34:13.091
Not nearly personal enough.

34:14.289 --> 34:15.688
[Grunts]

34:21.076 --> 34:22.375
Oh!

34:24.732 --> 34:26.697
Ashley!

34:26.723 --> 34:28.375
Oh! Thank God we found you.

34:28.536 --> 34:29.610
No.

34:35.730 --> 34:37.463
This needs magic.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.414
Mom.

34:41.721 --> 34:42.848
You can do it.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.938
[Gasping]

35:13.563 --> 35:16.682
I am so sorry for what I did.

35:16.707 --> 35:18.107
It's all right.

35:28.563 --> 35:31.063
You did it, Swan.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.792
Here we are.

35:59.071 --> 36:00.904
Told you I could help you, Doctor.

36:00.973 --> 36:03.073
Oh, my, yes. This is
exactly what I need.

36:03.384 --> 36:05.450
Just whose garage are we in, anyhow?

36:06.943 --> 36:08.445
That would be mine.

36:08.912 --> 36:11.048
Please, help yourself
to any of the equipment,

36:11.116 --> 36:14.184
but, um, steer clear
of the refrigerator.

36:15.052 --> 36:16.629
It's not food in there.

36:18.068 --> 36:19.033
[Clears throat]

36:19.370 --> 36:21.403
- Whale.
- Whale?

36:21.485 --> 36:23.983
Whale is my curse name, Dr. Jekyll.

36:24.061 --> 36:26.396
I did most of my best
work as Frankenstein.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.497
Oh, yes.

36:29.522 --> 36:32.302
It's an honor, Doctor. An honor.

36:32.770 --> 36:34.612
Uh, we must begin at once.

36:35.489 --> 36:37.449
Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Frankenstein.

36:37.474 --> 36:38.842
You know what that sounds like?

36:39.148 --> 36:41.731
The world's scariest-sounding
pediatrician's office.

36:41.756 --> 36:42.592
[Chuckles]

36:42.617 --> 36:47.287
That and a really first-rate
high-school science faculty.

36:47.724 --> 36:48.839
I mean, after we're done, we could have

36:48.864 --> 36:50.902
all this equipment
moved to the classrooms,

36:50.927 --> 36:52.794
could put these guys to work teaching.

36:53.634 --> 36:56.135
It's all part of getting
this town back to normal.

37:00.537 --> 37:02.637
Put some back into it, sister.

37:04.754 --> 37:07.046
Hook: She really was brave... Ashley.

37:07.272 --> 37:08.981
Putting love before life.

37:09.471 --> 37:10.837
Exactly.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.190
Move in with me.

37:20.634 --> 37:22.161
What?

37:22.533 --> 37:24.233
Move in with me.

37:26.072 --> 37:28.333
I know everything in life is uncertain,

37:28.435 --> 37:29.824
but sometimes you have
to walk out the door

37:29.849 --> 37:31.181
and hope there's not a bus.

37:31.558 --> 37:33.138
[Chuckles]

37:33.341 --> 37:34.704
I mean...

37:36.497 --> 37:37.933
I have a closet full of red jackets.

37:37.958 --> 37:39.878
I feel like I could make some
space for some black leather.

37:39.903 --> 37:41.275
Well, when you put it like that,

37:41.300 --> 37:44.534
then I would love to move in with you.

38:00.332 --> 38:02.542
You're still up? What's going on?

38:02.567 --> 38:05.568
Yeah. I have this...

38:07.088 --> 38:10.309
Gold gave me this. It's about the coin.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.377
A shepherd...

38:12.762 --> 38:15.080
found it in the wreckage of a cart.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.590
[Sighs]

38:22.012 --> 38:23.479
Your father.

38:24.162 --> 38:26.012
What a terrible reminder. I'm sorry.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.859
There's more to it.

38:28.286 --> 38:31.463
This man, my father, he'd been stabbed.

38:31.947 --> 38:33.265
He wasn't killed in the accident.

38:33.290 --> 38:35.238
He wasn't drunk.

38:35.263 --> 38:36.568
That's good news.

38:36.786 --> 38:39.871
He didn't betray you. He kept his word.

38:40.065 --> 38:42.065
That means his killer
could still be out there.

38:42.870 --> 38:44.198
Don't do this.

38:45.253 --> 38:49.214
Don't think about who
did it. Just let it go.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.349
Let us live our lives.

38:50.451 --> 38:52.111
I'll teach, you'll be sheriff.

38:52.136 --> 38:53.785
- Isn't this what a sheriff does?
- No, no, no.

38:53.821 --> 38:56.343
What you're contemplating
is vengeance, not justice,

38:56.368 --> 38:57.882
and we don't need vengeance.

38:57.907 --> 38:59.328
We have this town

38:59.353 --> 39:03.662
and our daughter and our
son who really needs you.

39:05.146 --> 39:06.999
It may not be epic,

39:07.794 --> 39:11.837
but it is the most important
thing you will ever do,

39:12.697 --> 39:14.274
and it won't happen

39:14.299 --> 39:19.244
if you're off seeking revenge
for some decades-old crime.

39:21.690 --> 39:24.583
Being there for Neal...

39:24.972 --> 39:27.172
how could that not be epic?

39:29.399 --> 39:31.605
Of course it's where I want to be.

39:32.698 --> 39:34.375
Good.

39:35.472 --> 39:36.762
Come to bed.

39:38.207 --> 39:40.349
You know what? I'm just gonna burn this.

39:40.374 --> 39:43.242
That way I don't even
have to think about it.

40:12.727 --> 40:14.658
Mr. Gold: <i>This is
for a little child.</i>

40:14.683 --> 40:16.668
<i>A little verse I like.</i>

40:17.023 --> 40:19.604
<i>Sleep well, my bairnie, sleep.</i>

40:19.673 --> 40:21.139
<i>The lang, lang shadows creep.</i>

40:21.483 --> 40:23.369
<i>The fairies play in
the munelicht brae,</i>

40:23.394 --> 40:25.277
<i>an' the stars are on the deep.</i>

40:25.308 --> 40:28.551
<i>The bogie man's awa',
the dancers rise an fa',</i>

40:28.576 --> 40:30.977
<i>an' the howlet's cry
frae the bour-tree high</i>

40:31.002 --> 40:32.584
<i>comes through the mossy shaw.</i>

40:32.869 --> 40:35.314
<i>Sleep well, my bairnie, sleep.</i>

40:35.486 --> 40:37.222
<i>The lang, lang shadows creep.</i>

40:37.467 --> 40:39.669
<i>The fairies play on
the munelicht brae,</i>

40:39.762 --> 40:42.697
<i>an' the stars are on the deep.</i>

40:44.264 --> 40:47.499
[ <i>Classic music plays</i> ]

40:47.601 --> 40:49.534
[Music stops]

40:50.249 --> 40:54.239
It's not fair. Even now the Savior wins.

40:54.264 --> 40:56.505
Yes, but for how long?

40:56.530 --> 40:58.744
Don't tell me to be patient.

40:59.163 --> 41:00.912
Right now, your pathetic half

41:00.937 --> 41:04.272
is working on a way to destroy <i> me.</i>

41:04.418 --> 41:06.017
My sympathies.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.239
I'm not asking for your sympathy.

41:08.264 --> 41:10.956
No, you're asking for my help.

41:11.058 --> 41:12.357
[Chains rattling]

41:12.459 --> 41:16.147
And that's a tall order to fill...

41:16.839 --> 41:20.699
from inside this cell, milady.

41:21.074 --> 41:24.208
Well, in that case.

41:27.012 --> 41:28.912
Let's take a walk.
