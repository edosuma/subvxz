WHO SHOWERS YOU WITH GIFTS,

07:02.355 --> 07:03.256
WHO LIVES HALFWAY

07:03.256 --> 07:04.458
AROUND THE WORLD.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.726
IS THERE A QUESTION?

07:05.726 --> 07:06.426
I'M PRETTY SURE

07:06.426 --> 07:08.662
THE ANSWER'S YES.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.396

07:10.598 --> 07:11.865
BUT I HATE SHARING MY FOOD,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.201
SO, NOT THE BEST JUDGE.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.135
>> OKAY.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.737
SURE, IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL,

07:16.737 --> 07:17.471
BUT IS MARRYING KASIM

07:17.471 --> 07:19.439
THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.608
>> I THINK SO.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.143
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.145
YOU GOT THIS.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.582
>> WHAT SIZE ARE THESE?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.852
ALWAYS GIRL, WE GOT YOU.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.723
>> OH, THANK YOU, LADIES.

>> OOH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.834
>> NO, IT'S A CRAZY STORY.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.101
RAQUEL LAID HER HEART

07:48.101 --> 07:49.302
ON THE LINE AND THEN--

07:49.302 --> 07:50.270
>> CHARLES STOMPED ON IT

07:50.270 --> 07:50.938
AND CHOSE PADMA.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.605
I KNOW THIS PART.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.641
I WANT TO KNOW THE REAL T.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.208
>> OKAY.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.277
SO I GOT BACK WITH ANTONIO

07:57.277 --> 07:59.079
FOR A MINUTE BUT THEN

07:59.079 --> 07:59.880
I REALIZED HE WASN'T READY--

07:59.880 --> 08:04.484
>> KEISHA.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.853
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:05.853 --> 08:06.587
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME,

08:06.587 --> 08:07.688
OR ENOUGH MARTINIS.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.256
SO I'M MOVING ON.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.157

WAS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE

17:30.117 --> 17:31.684
TO "ALANA'S BANANAS.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.941
>> FINE.

23:28.941 --> 23:29.609
I JUST THOUGHT--

23:29.609 --> 23:30.810
>> YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.178
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED

23:32.178 --> 23:33.646
AROUND HERE SINCE YOU LEFT.

23:33.646 --> 23:34.514
I'VE PUT THINGS

23:34.514 --> 23:35.147
WHERE I WANT THEM.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.449
YOU CAN'T JUST WALTZ IN HERE

23:36.449 --> 23:38.451
LIKE--

23:38.451 --> 23:40.653
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.154
>> NO. NO.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.623
LIKE WHAT?

23:43.623 --> 23:44.524
>> YOU AND I BOTH HAVE A LOT OF

23:44.524 --> 23:46.025
THINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.860
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THIS.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.061
>> WHY NOT?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.396
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN HOLDING

23:50.396 --> 23:51.297
ONTO SOMETHING EVER SINCE

23:51.297 --> 23:52.565
I'VE GOTTEN BACK.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.868
SO, LET'S HAVE IT.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.136
>> THIS MAY COME AS A SHOCK

23:57.136 --> 23:58.104
TO YOU,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.006
BUT EVERYBODY DOES NOT REVOLVE

24:00.006 --> 24:01.273
AROUND PLANET KEISHA.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.842
YOU NEVER WALK IN A ROOM AND

24:02.842 --> 24:06.546
ASK HOW ANYBODY ELSE IS DOING.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.213
>> OH, REALLY?

24:07.213 --> 24:07.880
>> REALLY.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.582
WHEN MALCOLM CALLED, YOU UP AND

24:09.582 --> 24:11.751
DISAPPEARED FOR THREE MONTHS.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.320
YOU BARELY CHECKED IN.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.622
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK,

24:15.622 --> 24:16.322
YOU JUST THINK THAT

24:16.322 --> 24:18.290
TIME HAS STOOD STILL?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.158
THAT THE SOFA IS WHERE YOU LEFT

24:19.158 --> 24:20.326
IT, AND EVERYTHING IS JUST GONNA

24:20.326 --> 24:22.562
PICK RIGHT BACK UP AGAIN?

24:22.562 --> 24:25.064
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, KEISHA.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.867
LIFE GOES ON.

24:27.867 --> 24:28.801
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT HERE

24:28.801 --> 24:30.803
TO SEE IT.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.774
>> YES,

24:34.774 --> 24:36.976
IT DOES.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.645
AND SINCE YOU THINK I'M SO GOOD

24:38.645 --> 24:40.647
AT DISAPPEARING...

24:46.919 --> 24:51.257
>> OH...MY...GOD.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.625
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.627
>> YEAH.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.536
>> MISS PRICE--[clears throat]

25:03.536 --> 25:04.704
MISS PRICE,

25:04.704 --> 25:06.305
THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY,

25:06.305 --> 25:07.674
BUT, AFTER CAREFUL

25:07.674 --> 25:09.075
CONSIDERATION,

25:09.075 --> 25:10.476
I CAN NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS

25:10.476 --> 25:11.711
OF YOUR OFFER.

25:11.711 --> 25:15.147
IT'S OUTSIDE OF MY

25:15.147 --> 25:16.315
MORAL COMFORT--NO.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.184
ACTUALLY,

25:18.184 --> 25:19.285
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO WORK

25:19.285 --> 25:20.419
AT PRICE MANAGEMENT.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.520
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.722
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

25:22.722 --> 25:25.858
MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.260
ALL RIGHT.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.328
>> IT'S THAT GIRL

25:29.328 --> 25:30.763
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.430
UGH.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.833
I KNOW, RIGHT?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.802
HANK IS GOING TO HAVE A FIT

25:35.802 --> 25:37.670
WHEN HE FINDS OUT THOUGH.

25:37.670 --> 25:41.373
[laughing]

25:41.373 --> 25:42.875
I OWE HIM AFTER HE TRIED TO

25:42.875 --> 25:43.743
SCREW ME ON THAT COMMERCIAL

25:43.743 --> 25:45.211
DEAL.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.278
OH, DON'T WORRY.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.213
SHE'LL NEVER BE ABLE

25:47.213 --> 25:48.681
TO PULL IT OFF.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.617
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THE SOB

25:50.617 --> 25:52.785
STORY SHE COMES BACK WITH.

25:52.785 --> 25:55.154
I'M SURE IT WILL BE EPOCH.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.156
[laughing]

26:11.237 --> 26:13.339
>> YOU KNOW HE WAS STILL LATE?

26:13.339 --> 26:14.073
I'M GONNA GO SAY SOMETHING

26:14.073 --> 26:14.874
TO HIM.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.876
>> YEAH, BUT BE COOL.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.380
>> YOU WERE LATE. ALL RIGHT?

26:21.380 --> 26:22.649
NOW, I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU 10

26:22.649 --> 26:23.783
O'CLOCK, BUT YOU--

26:23.783 --> 26:25.484
YOU WERE STILL LATE.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.719
>> COME ON, MALCOLM.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.120
LET'S BE HONEST.

26:28.120 --> 26:28.788
YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS

26:28.788 --> 26:29.455
WHETHER OR NOT

26:29.455 --> 26:30.790
THE EX-CON BROTHER IS THERE.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.060
>> SO, YOU GUYS HUNGRY?

26:34.060 --> 26:35.361
>> I'M OUT.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.329
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.331
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.138
>> WHAT, MALCOLM?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.740
>> TODAY IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.075
OKAY?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.409
NOW I NEED FOR YOU TO LOSE

26:50.409 --> 26:51.477
THE ATTITUDE AND JUST

26:51.477 --> 26:53.479
GET IT TOGETHER, MAN.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.649
THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR POPS?

26:56.649 --> 26:58.217
FOR ME?

26:58.217 --> 27:00.352
>> FOR YOU?

27:00.352 --> 27:01.553
DUDE, PLEASE.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.055
>> JUST GO, T. JUST GO.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.057
BE THE HOTHEAD JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.359
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.195
POPS KNEW.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.496
>> POPS KNEW?

27:10.496 --> 27:13.099
POPS KNEW, HUH?

27:13.099 --> 27:14.566
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE CHOSE ME

27:14.566 --> 27:15.768
TO RUN THE COMPANY.

27:15.768 --> 27:19.605
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

27:19.605 --> 27:20.372
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE Y'ALL

27:20.372 --> 27:21.107
LOOKING AT?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.041
>> I'M SORRY.

27:22.041 --> 27:22.742
>> WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

27:22.742 --> 27:23.409
EVERYTHING--

27:23.409 --> 27:25.912
>> THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.914
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.118
EITHER OF YOU.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.801
>> I DON'T USUALLY BRING FOOD

27:48.801 --> 27:50.970
TO PEOPLE WHO YELL AT ME,

27:50.970 --> 27:52.604
BUT I'M GUESSING

27:52.604 --> 27:54.140
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN IN A WHILE.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.142
>> THANKS.

27:57.977 --> 27:58.644
>> I'M SORRY TO--

27:58.644 --> 28:01.047
>> HEY.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.181
DON'T COME OUT HERE TALKING

28:02.181 --> 28:02.849
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

28:02.849 --> 28:03.515
GOING THROUGH.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.118
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.219
>> BUT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

28:07.219 --> 28:08.287
TO HAVE A FAMILY WHO DOESN'T

28:08.287 --> 28:09.355
GET YOU.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.323
WHO TRIES TO TURN YOU INTO

28:11.323 --> 28:13.292
WHATEVER THEY WANT YOU TO BE.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.828
I'VE SPENT YEARS

28:15.828 --> 28:17.997
LIVING A LIFE THAT WAY.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.966
>> YOU ARE NOTHING LIKE ME.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.734
>> MAYBE NOT.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.269
BUT THE RESENTMENT,

28:23.269 --> 28:24.904
THE NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY

28:24.904 --> 28:26.906
FOR DOUBTING YOU, I GET THAT.

28:29.742 --> 28:30.642
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE THAN

28:30.642 --> 28:31.778
LETTING YOUR FAMILY MAKE CHOICES

28:31.778 --> 28:34.346
FOR YOU?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.482
LETTING ANGER DO IT.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.350
IT ONLY WINDS UP HURTING YOU

28:38.350 --> 28:39.618
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.653
>> WHY DO YOU CARE?

28:41.653 --> 28:43.022
>> I JUST CAN'T STAND TO SEE

28:43.022 --> 28:44.156
TWO PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER

28:44.156 --> 28:45.792
IMPLODE.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.794
>> THEN YOU BETTER LOOK AWAY.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.333
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.407
>> [sighs]

29:08.080 --> 29:10.682
TODAY WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.419
YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.721
HOW ARE YOU?

29:15.721 --> 29:17.623
>> I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.490
THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE

29:18.490 --> 29:19.758
I'VE HAD TO BREATHE.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.093
>> I KNOW.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.095
BUT YOU CAN BREATHE NOW.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.597
>> I'M DONE WITH TRAVELING

29:25.597 --> 29:27.599
FOR A WHILE.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.537
LET'S JUST STAY IN THIS SUITE,

29:31.537 --> 29:33.039
RELAX, AND JUST FIGURE OUT

29:33.039 --> 29:35.041
WHAT'S NEXT.

29:35.041 --> 29:35.875
I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

29:35.875 --> 29:36.976
EVERYTHING IS STABLE WITH THE

29:36.976 --> 29:38.110
COMPANY, AND I JUST FEEL LIKE

29:38.110 --> 29:39.311
PEOPLE NEED TO SEE MY FACE

29:39.311 --> 29:40.279
AROUND HERE.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.647
I REALLY HOPE THAT DOESN'T

29:41.647 --> 29:43.816
DISAPPOINTMENT YOU.

29:43.816 --> 29:47.019
>> NO. NOT AT ALL.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.187
I'M KIND OF DONE WITH TRAVELING

29:48.187 --> 29:49.088
TOO.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.023
I MISS MY LIFE HERE,

29:51.023 --> 29:52.724
MY FRIENDS...

29:52.724 --> 29:54.593
I'M READY TO COME HOME.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.128
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.229
>> I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK

29:57.229 --> 29:59.465
I WAS TYING YOU DOWN.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.699
LOSING MY EDGE.

30:00.699 --> 30:01.633
>> YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING

30:01.633 --> 30:02.668
THE SAME THING.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.236
YEAH.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.105
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US?

30:06.105 --> 30:10.309
ARE WE SETTLING DOWN ALREADY?

30:10.309 --> 30:11.577
ARE WE THE HUXTABLES?

30:11.577 --> 30:12.778
>> OH, GOOD GOD, I HOPE NOT.

30:12.778 --> 30:13.445
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.447
[laughing]

30:20.519 --> 30:22.521
[doorbell rings]

30:26.658 --> 30:27.326
>> HI.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.029
>> HI.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.098
OH.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.500
THE NEW COLORS LOOK HOT.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.634
>> IF YOU'RE GONNA THROW THAT AT

30:35.634 --> 30:36.903
ME, I SHOULD PROBABLY PUT

30:36.903 --> 30:38.170
THE DROP CLOTHS BACK ON.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.172
>> NO PROTECTION REQUIRED.

30:46.979 --> 30:47.947
HERE.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.316
I KNOW I'M A BIT LATE, BUT,

30:50.316 --> 30:52.151
IT'S A BREAKUP SURVIVAL KIT.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.920
EVERYTHING A SINGLE LADY NEEDS.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.621
WELL, ALMOST.

30:55.621 --> 30:56.755
YOU STILL HAVE THOSE BATTERIES

30:56.755 --> 30:57.856
IN YOUR NIGHT STAND, RIGHT?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.458
>> HOW DARE YOU?

30:59.458 --> 31:00.960
>> OH, I SEE, I KNOW YOU BETTER

31:00.960 --> 31:02.962
THAN YOU THINK.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.168
LISTEN, I DIDN'T LIKE HEARING

31:09.168 --> 31:09.902
WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY

31:09.902 --> 31:11.403
THE OTHER DAY,

31:11.403 --> 31:13.105
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.974
I JUST FLOATED OFF IN MY HAPPY

31:14.974 --> 31:17.543
BUBBLE WITH MALCOLM,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.445
AND I WASN'T HERE FOR YOU,

31:19.445 --> 31:21.780
AND I'M SORRY.

31:21.780 --> 31:22.814
>> I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT

31:22.814 --> 31:23.882
TO COME OUT THAT WAY.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.385
I JUST--I KIND OF LOST IT.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.486
>> YEAH, YOU DID.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.687
BUT IT'S OKAY.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.457
I KNOW I CAN BE A LITTLE

31:31.457 --> 31:33.292
SELF-ABSORBED.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.261
[laughing]

31:35.261 --> 31:36.595
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN

31:36.595 --> 31:38.530
THAT YOU CAN'T COUNT ON ME.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.232
I WILL ALWAYS BE RIDE OR DIE

31:40.232 --> 31:41.633
FOR YOU, GIRL.

31:41.633 --> 31:42.768
>> I KNOW.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.770
>> OKAY.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.607
LET'S OPEN IT UP.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.479
>> HI.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.380
I'M SORRY. DO WE--

31:54.380 --> 31:55.047
>> NO.

31:55.047 --> 31:55.814
WE DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

31:55.814 --> 31:56.648
HI, I'M APRIL GOLDBERG

31:56.648 --> 31:57.316
AND I JUST NEED

31:57.316 --> 31:58.550
FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.187
YOU KNOW FELICIA PRICE, RIGHT?

32:01.187 --> 32:02.754
>> LADY MACBITCH.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.789
SURE.

32:03.789 --> 32:04.856
WHOSE LIFE IS SHE TRYING

32:04.856 --> 32:05.992
TO RUIN NOW?

32:05.992 --> 32:07.159
>> YOURS.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.327
SHE WANTS EPOCH, AND SHE'S GOING

32:08.327 --> 32:09.195
TO STEAL HIM FROM YOU.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.829
>> WHAT? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

32:10.829 --> 32:13.365
>> SHE SENT ME TO DO IT.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.167
>> WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.268
>> BECAUSE,

32:16.268 --> 32:17.869
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

32:17.869 --> 32:18.804
HERE'S THE THING.

32:18.804 --> 32:19.805
BOTTOM LINE,

32:19.805 --> 32:21.107
YOU CAN'T BEAT FELICIA.

32:21.107 --> 32:21.807
IF SHE WANTS EPOCH,

32:21.807 --> 32:23.142
SHE'S GONNA GET HIM.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.111
SO YOUR BEST OPTION

32:25.111 --> 32:27.113
IS TO SHARE EPOCH WITH ME,

32:27.113 --> 32:28.680
OFF THE RECORD OF COURSE.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.249
>> AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

32:30.249 --> 32:31.217
>> WELL, WITH FELICIA'S

32:31.217 --> 32:32.418
REPUTATION AND THE FIRM'S

32:32.418 --> 32:33.919
RESOURCES I CAN DOUBLE

32:33.919 --> 32:35.287
YOUR CLIENT'S EARNINGS.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.722
SO, YOU SHARE EPOCH WITH ME,

32:36.722 --> 32:38.357
YOU LOSE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.658
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.360
OR YOU CAN GO UP AGAINST

32:41.360 --> 32:43.462
FELICIA, AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS

32:43.462 --> 32:45.464
OUT FOR YOU.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.040
>> IT'S DONE.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.307
EPOCH IS OFFICIALLY A CLIENT

32:55.307 --> 32:56.342
OF PRICE MANAGEMENT.

32:56.342 --> 32:57.009
>> TAKE THAT TO BUSINESS

32:57.009 --> 32:57.676
AFFAIRS.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.545
THEY'RE ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.114
OH, AND WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE,

33:02.114 --> 33:03.749
TALK TO THEM ABOUT YOUR DEAL.

33:03.749 --> 33:04.950
>> WAIT, MY DEAL?

33:04.950 --> 33:07.919
DOES THIS THIS MEAN I'M HIRED?

33:07.919 --> 33:08.720
>> HOPEFULLY IT MEANS

33:08.720 --> 33:10.722
YOU'RE GONNA BUY A NEW WARDROBE.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.700
>> WITH REGARDS TO FRANKS

33:21.700 --> 33:23.702
JEWELS, LLC AND ITS HOLDINGS,

33:23.702 --> 33:25.071
I ASK THAT THE COMPANY SHARES

33:25.071 --> 33:26.172
BE DIVIDED EQUALLY

33:26.172 --> 33:27.439
BETWEEN MY TWO SONS,

33:27.439 --> 33:29.075
MALCOLM FRANKS JUNIOR

33:29.075 --> 33:30.976
AND TERRANCE FRANKS.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.111
I WANT TERRANCE TO TAKE HIS

33:32.111 --> 33:33.079
RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE COMPANY

33:33.079 --> 33:35.147
BY HIS BROTHER'S SIDE.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.415
>> WHAT?

33:36.415 --> 33:39.017
NO, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

33:39.017 --> 33:39.751
>> MALCOLM.

33:39.751 --> 33:40.852
>> I NEED TO SEE THAT WILL.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.620
THERE'S NO WAY MY FATHER

33:41.620 --> 33:42.288
WROTE THAT.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.422
>> JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

33:43.422 --> 33:44.623
RESPECT ME,

33:44.623 --> 33:45.457
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

33:45.457 --> 33:47.659
POPS DIDN'T.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.628
>> I NEED TO SEE THE WILL.

33:50.629 --> 33:51.897
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

33:51.897 --> 33:52.731
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

33:52.731 --> 33:54.733
BUT WE HAVE AN URGENT MATTER

33:54.733 --> 33:56.468
THAT COULDN'T WAIT.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.270
MY CLIENT AND I ARE HERE

33:58.270 --> 33:59.571
TO CONTEST THE LAST WILL

33:59.571 --> 34:00.572
AND TESTAMENT

34:00.572 --> 34:03.008
OF MR. MALCOLM FRANKS SENIOR.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.476
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

34:04.476 --> 34:06.478
>> HIS WIFE.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.020
>> APRIL, CONGRATULATIONS ON

34:15.020 --> 34:15.921
YOUR NEW JOB,

34:15.921 --> 34:16.955
AND SHOWING FELICIA

34:16.955 --> 34:17.656
THAT YOU COULD SWIM

34:17.656 --> 34:18.590
WITH THE SHARKS.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.291
>> HERE'S TO HOPING

34:19.291 --> 34:21.560
I DON'T BECOME CHUM.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.861
>> AND TO RAQUEL,

34:22.861 --> 34:25.030
FOR SURVIVING TWO BREAKUPS,

34:25.030 --> 34:27.899
AND STILL LOOKING FABULOUS,

34:27.899 --> 34:29.968
AND FOR GOING IN ON KEISHA

34:29.968 --> 34:32.271
THE WAY I ALWAYS WANTED TO.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.071
SALUD.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.206
>> SALUD.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.743
[cell phone vibrating]

34:37.743 --> 34:38.944
>> EVE.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.912
HI. YEAH, SURE.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.982
HOW ARE YOU?

34:43.982 --> 34:45.984
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. THANKS.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.257
>> HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

34:51.257 --> 34:53.058
>> NO.

34:53.058 --> 34:55.627
EVE JUST BROKE UP WITH ME.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.495
>> I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO CLARIFY

34:56.495 --> 34:58.464
THAT.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.865
>> SHE'S PULLING HER INVESTMENT

34:59.865 --> 35:01.733
IN INDULGENCE.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.335
APPARENTLY SHE GOT SOME BIG

35:03.335 --> 35:05.337
MARKETING CONTRACT WITH H.S.N.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.805
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP

35:06.805 --> 35:09.007
IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

35:09.007 --> 35:10.842
>> SO WHAT? SO THAT'S IT?

35:10.842 --> 35:12.144
SHE'S JUST OUT?

35:12.144 --> 35:14.146
>> DAMN, EVE.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.182
>> OH, MY GOSH.

35:16.182 --> 35:17.349
I'VE GOT ABOUT SIX MONTHS

35:17.349 --> 35:19.918
TO FIND AN INVESTOR.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.587
I PUT MY ENTIRE SAVINGS

35:21.587 --> 35:23.589
INTO THIS PLACE.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.503
[sighs]

36:05.331 --> 36:07.533
>> WOW.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.601
YOU REALLY ARE AS GORGEOUS

36:09.601 --> 36:12.238
AS I REMEMBER.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.440
>> THANK YOU.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.074
>> SO WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK, OR

36:16.074 --> 36:17.476
SHOULD WE GO STRAIGHT TO DINNER?

36:17.476 --> 36:19.311
>> NO. I WOULD LOVE A DRINK.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.846
I DEFINITELY NEED ONE.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.581
>> OKAY, HAVE A SEAT.

36:22.581 --> 36:23.615
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

36:23.615 --> 36:24.950
>> I WOULD LOVE A VODKA TONIC.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.719
>> VODKA TONIC COMING RIGHT UP.

36:27.719 --> 36:28.787
TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.856
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.424
ACTUALLY, YOU PROBABLY DO.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.092
I MEAN, WE ALL HAVE THEM, RIGHT?

36:34.092 --> 36:34.960
>> TECHNICALLY, I DON'T HAVE

36:34.960 --> 36:36.628
AN OFFICE, BUT I DO HAVE

36:36.628 --> 36:38.664
MY BAD DAYS, FOR SURE.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.765
I HATE SEEING THE PRESSURE THESE

36:39.765 --> 36:41.233
KIDS ARE UNDER, YOU KNOW?

36:41.233 --> 36:45.003
IN FACT, THIS KID IN OHIO ALMOST

36:45.003 --> 36:47.373
LOST A TRYOUT BECAUSE OF YOU.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.307
>> BECAUSE OF ME?

36:48.307 --> 36:50.175
>> MM-HMM.

36:50.175 --> 36:52.378
SO THE DAY AFTER WE MEET,

36:52.378 --> 36:53.812
I'M IN OHIO TO WATCH SUPPOSED

36:53.812 --> 36:55.281
NEXT LEBRON JAMES PLAY,

36:55.281 --> 36:56.315
RIGHT?

36:56.315 --> 36:57.983
BUT, I CAN BARELY FOCUS,

36:57.983 --> 36:59.184
BECAUSE ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

36:59.184 --> 37:00.686
IS BEING TRAPPED

37:00.686 --> 37:02.187
IN AN ELEVATOR WITH YOU.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.789
>> OH, OKAY.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.924
SO I RUINED THE CHANCES

37:05.924 --> 37:07.393
FOR THE NEXT LEBRON JAMES.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.994
>> NOT QUITE.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.296
[laughter]

37:10.296 --> 37:11.430
NO, I MEAN THIS GUY DEFINITELY

37:11.430 --> 37:13.031
OWES YOU A BASKET OF MUFFINS

37:13.031 --> 37:13.899
OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE I WAS

37:13.899 --> 37:14.900
DEFINITELY IN A MUCH BETTER MOOD

37:14.900 --> 37:15.667
THANKS TO YOU.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.335
>> REALLY?

37:16.335 --> 37:17.969
>> MM-HMM.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.271
>> WELL, NOW I'M IN A REALLY

37:19.271 --> 37:21.840
GOOD MOOD THANKS TO YOU.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.508
>> I'D LIKE TO PUT YOU

37:22.508 --> 37:23.174
IN A BETTER MOOD.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.543
>> IS THAT SO?

37:24.543 --> 37:26.545
>> MM-HMM.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.019
HOW'S THAT?

37:34.019 --> 37:34.786
>> OH, I'M, DEFINITELY

37:34.786 --> 37:36.788
IN A BETTER MOOD.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.360
SO WHAT'S AFTER BETTER?

37:43.829 --> 37:44.496
>> I COULD THINK OF

37:44.496 --> 37:46.498
A FEW THINGS.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.115
>> YOU KNOW, MAKING OUT LIKE

38:04.115 --> 38:04.783
THIS ON THE COUCH REMINDS ME

38:04.783 --> 38:06.418
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.519
>> SCARED YOUR PARENTS MIGHT

38:07.519 --> 38:09.521
COME IN AND CATCH US?

38:15.394 --> 38:16.462
DON'T WORRY.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.363
WE'RE GROWN UPS,

38:17.363 --> 38:19.598
WE WON'T GET INTO ANY TROUBLE.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.132
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

38:21.132 --> 38:22.968
>> I SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA

38:22.968 --> 38:24.536
GET IN TROUBLE.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.538
PROMISE.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.808
>> UM.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.010
I'M SORRY.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.645
I CAN'T DO THIS, ALEC.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.181
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

38:36.181 --> 38:38.350
>> NOTHING.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.218
I MEAN, NOTHING WITH YOU,

38:40.218 --> 38:42.153
OBVIOUSLY.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.254
ALTHOUGH, YOU ARE PERFECT.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.791
LOOK, I KNOW THIS WOULD BE

38:45.791 --> 38:46.692
A LOT OF FUN,

38:46.692 --> 38:48.226
AND THAT IT WOULD MAKE ME

38:48.226 --> 38:49.695
FEEL A LOT BETTER, BUT,

38:49.695 --> 38:51.830
YOU KNOW, JUST FOR ONE NIGHT,

38:51.830 --> 38:53.565
BECAUSE, AFTER THAT, THEN IT'S

38:53.565 --> 38:54.933
JUST GONNA BE A MONTH OF,

38:54.933 --> 38:56.201
"WHEN AM I GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN?

38:56.201 --> 38:57.002
AND DO I EVEN WANT TO

38:57.002 --> 38:57.703
SEE HIM AGAIN?

38:57.703 --> 38:58.737
AND SHOULD I HAVE SLEPT WITH

38:58.737 --> 38:59.671
THIS GUY ON THE FIRST DATE?

38:59.671 --> 39:01.339
AND WHY EVEN MESS WITH A GUY WHO

39:01.339 --> 39:03.509
DOESN'T LIVE IN MY SAME CITY?"

39:03.509 --> 39:05.511
I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.145
THREE MONTHS AGO, I WAS RUNNING

39:07.145 --> 39:08.414
AFTER THIS GUY, LITERALLY,

39:08.414 --> 39:09.415
THROUGH A MARATHON,

39:09.415 --> 39:10.616
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE

39:10.616 --> 39:11.983
RUNNERS, BEGGING FOR HIM

39:11.983 --> 39:12.851
TO TAKE ME BACK.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.685
>> WOW.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.654
>> YES, WOW, EXACTLY.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.523
I MEAN, IF I AM GONNA BE AN

39:17.523 --> 39:18.924
ADULT, I NEED TO START ACTING

39:18.924 --> 39:20.759
LIKE ONE, AND, AS MUCH AS

39:20.759 --> 39:22.694
I WOULD LOVE THE SEXY DIVERSION

39:22.694 --> 39:24.930
FROM ALL THE TROUBLES IN MY LIFE

39:24.930 --> 39:26.031
RIGHT NOW, AND THAT BOMB THAT

39:26.031 --> 39:26.832
JUST DROPPED ON MY BUSINESS,

39:26.832 --> 39:30.569
I KNOW THAT,

39:30.569 --> 39:32.270
I JUST KNOW THAT

39:32.270 --> 39:33.338
THIS IS JUST GONNA GET ME

39:33.338 --> 39:34.806
IN MORE TROUBLE.

39:34.806 --> 39:39.478
>> SO THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.447
>> I'M SORRY.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.448
>> ME TOO.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.450
>> I'M GONNA GO, ALEC.

39:50.622 --> 39:51.823
IS IT OKAY IF I HOLD ONTO

39:51.823 --> 39:52.658
YOUR NUMBER?

39:52.658 --> 39:54.225
>> HELL, YEAH.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.226
>> OKAY.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.728
GOOD.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.696
GOOD.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.130
YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE

39:59.130 --> 39:59.931
I CHANGE MY MIND.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.032
>> RIGHT.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.034
>> OKAY, BYE.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.139
>> announcer: NEXT,

40:08.139 --> 40:09.007
ON SINGLE LADIES.

40:09.007 --> 40:09.708
>> READY?

40:09.708 --> 40:11.109
>> I WAS BORN READY.

40:11.109 --> 40:11.943
>> MALCOLM.

40:11.943 --> 40:12.611
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:12.611 --> 40:13.745
>> NAOMI'S CHALLENGE TO THE WILL

40:13.745 --> 40:14.780
IS GOING FORWARD.

40:14.780 --> 40:15.447
>> THAT BITCH CAN CLAIM

40:15.447 --> 40:16.347
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.082
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

40:17.082 --> 40:18.049
SHE WAS MARRIED TO HIM.

40:18.049 --> 40:18.984
>> IF YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST

40:18.984 --> 40:20.486
WALK IN HERE AND PLAY ME--

40:20.486 --> 40:22.187
>> SWEETIE,

40:22.187 --> 40:23.922
I DID JUST WALK IN HERE.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.191
>> FELICIA, IT'S MY FIRST DAY.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.759
>> DARLING, NO ONE EATS

40:27.759 --> 40:28.727
GLUTEN ANY MORE.

40:28.727 --> 40:29.828
>> HOW LONG

40:29.828 --> 40:31.697
DO I HAVE TO STAND HERE

40:31.697 --> 40:33.699
BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR NAME?
