01:38.743 --> 01:40.141
<i>Nathan.</i>

01:40.910 --> 01:42.200
<i>How are you, old man?</i>

01:43.075 --> 01:45.093
<i>Very good.
Thank you, Mr. Knighton.</i>

01:45.240 --> 01:47.075
You look like
the walking dead.

01:47.158 --> 01:48.645
Yes. Well, I’m always
a little bit cold

01:48.810 --> 01:50.393
when I’ve
just got out of bed.

01:50.475 --> 01:52.326
Perhaps you can tell me
why I’ve been summoned,

01:52.408 --> 01:54.494
8:00 a.m.
on a Sunday morning?

01:54.576 --> 01:56.908
Well, if you’d care to study the film,
you’ll see that two nights ago,

01:56.990 --> 02:01.158
some heavily guarded cargo was
ambushed outside a facility in Johannesburg,

02:01.240 --> 02:05.158
<i>where 20 security guards
were mercilessly annihilated.</i>

02:05.240 --> 02:07.596
<i>I want you to retrieve
what went missing</i>

02:07.678 --> 02:09.763
<i>and to find out
who the seller is,</i>

02:09.941 --> 02:11.616
<i>who the buyer is,</i>

02:12.241 --> 02:13.494
and what it is.

02:13.576 --> 02:16.661
So we don’t know exactly
what it is, sir?

02:16.782 --> 02:20.266
<i>No. That is the mystery.</i>

02:20.490 --> 02:22.602
But our analysts
in intelligence reported

02:22.684 --> 02:26.033
it very quickly became extremely popular
with the wrong sort of people.

02:26.115 --> 02:28.366
<i>And with a price tag
of around ten billion,</i>

02:28.448 --> 02:32.407
I don’t think we can afford for it
to remain a mystery much longer.

02:34.323 --> 02:37.408
It’s been given the name
“the Handle.”

02:37.490 --> 02:40.450
But why me?
Why not the official intelligence branch?

02:40.532 --> 02:43.282
<i>Ruse de guerre,</i> Nathan.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.794
An unorthodox approach to war.

02:45.876 --> 02:48.794
I need a creative, cunning
and unconventional vision

02:48.876 --> 02:51.860
to retrieve
this kind of mercurial threat.

02:51.942 --> 02:55.033
A courier on a bicycle
in congested traffic,

02:55.115 --> 02:56.595
not the official team.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.908
They’d take forever
to wade through the administration,

02:58.990 --> 03:00.616
and the clock doth ticketh.

03:01.843 --> 03:04.361
So, who will be
heading up your team?

03:04.443 --> 03:06.741
Oh, the usual chap.
Orson Fortune.

03:07.408 --> 03:08.728
Oh, fuck.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.158
That man is
an administrative nightmare.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.434
He can’t fly unless there’s a
private jet because of claustrophobia.

03:14.516 --> 03:17.491
Then he needs sedating with the
finest claret because of agoraphobia.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.090
And then there’s the
rehabilitation in the Maldives

03:20.175 --> 03:22.074
because
of cloudo-bloody-phobia.

03:23.157 --> 03:24.381
Yes, I understand, sir.

03:24.463 --> 03:26.261
But when you cut back
on his expenses

03:26.343 --> 03:29.491
and created a mental health department,
it was a perfect storm.

03:29.573 --> 03:32.857
He’s trained to exploit
every system presented,

03:32.942 --> 03:36.741
which is why he is the very
bicycle courier you require.

03:36.823 --> 03:37.866
Where is he?

03:37.948 --> 03:40.508
<i>Well, it’s funny you should
say that, sir. He is on one of his...</i>

03:40.828 --> 03:43.461
<i>rehabilitation retreats.</i>

03:43.543 --> 03:46.752
<i>Yes, you are paying for that,
sir, but don’t worry.</i>

03:46.835 --> 03:48.283
I think I can pull him in.

03:48.365 --> 03:49.825
The fuck are you
doing here, Nathan?

03:49.907 --> 03:51.825
- Everything all right, Orson?
- No, it’s not.

03:51.907 --> 03:54.065
I’m supposed to be on holiday,

03:54.147 --> 03:57.366
and you’re supposed to be
4,000 miles in that direction.

03:58.157 --> 04:02.039
Actually, it’s 3,000 miles in that direction.
But whatever.

04:02.121 --> 04:04.324
- Mind if I come in?
- Yes, I fucking do.

04:05.515 --> 04:06.866
Aren’t you gonna ask
why I’m here?

04:06.948 --> 04:09.284
No, I’m fucking not,
because you’re not staying.

04:09.366 --> 04:11.575
Wouldn’t be here
if it wasn’t serious.

04:11.657 --> 04:13.628
I don’t care
how fucking serious it is.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.200
I’m on holiday, and I’m not
interested in working at the moment.

04:16.281 --> 04:20.468
There’s a price to pay for
possessing a unique set of skills,

04:20.610 --> 04:22.728
being as brilliant as you are,

04:22.810 --> 04:25.793
and please don’t take this
the wrong way,

04:25.875 --> 04:30.700
as a private contractor,
your government pays you handsomely for.

04:30.782 --> 04:33.366
I’m ignoring this apparition.
I’m talking to an empty space.

04:33.448 --> 04:34.700
You’re going home.

04:34.782 --> 04:36.482
And I’m gonna
meet my girlfriend...

04:38.081 --> 04:39.908
- at the bar.
- Ah, yes.

04:39.990 --> 04:41.827
About that girlfriend of yours.

04:41.909 --> 04:45.366
It seems as though she’s not
just your girlfriend.

04:45.448 --> 04:47.699
But don’t worry,
we’ll fly her home first class.

04:48.643 --> 04:51.533
- Have you been spying on me, Nathan?
- I am sorry.

04:51.615 --> 04:54.199
But something rather nasty
has been stolen.

04:54.776 --> 04:55.991
How nasty?

04:56.596 --> 04:58.325
Under file A is file B.

04:58.407 --> 05:00.786
That’s the list
of nefarious potential buyers

05:00.868 --> 05:02.313
whose interests
have been aroused.

05:02.395 --> 05:04.079
We don’t know
what was stolen.

05:04.161 --> 05:05.802
That remains a mystery
for you to solve.

05:05.884 --> 05:08.918
But we need to stop it
getting onto the open market.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.491
Threat’s imminent.

05:11.573 --> 05:14.116
- How imminent?
- Imminently imminent.

05:14.198 --> 05:17.484
Put it this way. When you hit the ground,
you’ll be running, literally.

05:17.643 --> 05:19.126
We’ve got the plane.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.193
The BBJ, this year’s model.

05:21.275 --> 05:23.461
And all your medicinal requirements.

05:23.543 --> 05:26.116
’82, ’96, 2004.

05:27.842 --> 05:29.427
Marinate.

05:29.509 --> 05:31.105
And I’ll see you
in two minutes.

05:31.187 --> 05:34.059
<i>Fine.
So Orson will be heading your team.</i>

05:34.141 --> 05:36.628
Will you be using John,
the comms man?

05:36.710 --> 05:39.135
- Ah, sadly not, sir.
- Isn’t he the best?

05:39.240 --> 05:40.633
Well, he might be good,

05:40.715 --> 05:44.099
but he turned out to be
something of a duplicitous snake.

05:44.181 --> 05:47.160
He went over
to Mike Hook’s team.

05:47.242 --> 05:49.006
Ah, Mike,
the competition.

05:49.088 --> 05:51.393
Yes. Just on that note, sir,
I do hope we won’t be competing

05:51.475 --> 05:53.616
for the same prize
on this mission with Mike.

05:53.698 --> 05:56.451
There is more than one security
department in this government.

05:56.533 --> 05:58.366
Mike is on another job.

05:58.448 --> 05:59.814
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

06:01.034 --> 06:02.850
- Afternoon, Lucinda.
- Sir.

06:03.409 --> 06:05.741
Oh, I was starting to worry.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.013
- Had to get changed.
- Didn’t we all?

06:08.095 --> 06:10.227
- Captain, can we warm the engines up?
- Right away, sir.

06:10.309 --> 06:11.360
Isn’t that the ’82?

06:11.448 --> 06:12.866
It’s still drinking well.

06:12.948 --> 06:14.885
Isn’t this
my medicinal requirement?

06:14.967 --> 06:16.367
Yes.

06:17.448 --> 06:19.366
Thirsty, were ya?

06:19.463 --> 06:22.032
Party for one,
like all your parties?

06:26.942 --> 06:28.284
Is it the usual team?

06:28.366 --> 06:29.908
- Minus John.
- Where’s John?

06:29.990 --> 06:31.616
- John got poached.
- By who?

06:31.698 --> 06:33.372
By “whom.”
Never mind.

06:33.532 --> 06:35.283
But I do mind. I know John.

06:35.376 --> 06:37.700
I like John.
I trust John. He’s a pro.

06:37.782 --> 06:39.409
- Someone paying him more?
- Yes.

06:39.491 --> 06:42.491
If I asked,
would you pay me more?

06:42.573 --> 06:43.866
- You can ask.
- Will you pay me more?

06:43.948 --> 06:45.427
No.

06:45.509 --> 06:47.394
You’re above
that grubby self-interest.

06:47.476 --> 06:49.040
You’re a patriot.

06:49.122 --> 06:52.116
And besides,
no one gets treated like you get treated.

06:52.198 --> 06:54.649
When you say “you,”
you really mean you.

06:54.809 --> 06:56.450
Anyway, who’s my footman?

06:56.532 --> 06:58.201
I found
a splendid replacement.

06:58.283 --> 07:00.366
- What’s his name?
- Sarah Fidel.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.234
Strong nom de guerre.

07:03.316 --> 07:05.699
- Never heard of him.
- That’s because she’s an American.

07:07.149 --> 07:08.365
“She.”

07:09.122 --> 07:12.699
Lucinda, bring
the 2004 Haut-Brion, please.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.309
I’ll help myself to a beer.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.660
<i>I have a rather fabulous
replacement for Comms John.</i>

07:24.782 --> 07:28.849
An American, much more versatile and creative.
Sarah Fidel.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.593
Didn’t she work with Mike?

07:31.698 --> 07:35.127
Mike, consistent with his character,
abandoned her in Beirut,

07:35.209 --> 07:36.494
which is where
I picked her up.

07:36.576 --> 07:37.860
Any other footmen?

07:37.942 --> 07:40.727
Yes, this young man, JJ Davies.

07:40.809 --> 07:42.908
There really isn’t very much
he can’t do either.

07:42.990 --> 07:46.700
Comms, guns, driving, diving,
rapping, slapping, you name it.

07:46.782 --> 07:51.355
They are both two comprehensive footmen,
the perfect all-rounders.

08:01.775 --> 08:03.760
Isn’t that JJ?
What’s he doing here?

08:03.842 --> 08:05.528
He’s joined the team.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.194
He’s a good kid,
but isn’t he a bit green?

08:08.276 --> 08:10.793
He’s been very busy
since you last saw him.

08:10.875 --> 08:15.141
He’s what you might call
enthusiastic, hungry, keen.

08:15.223 --> 08:17.123
Don’t put your fingers
near his mouth.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.366
- JJ.
- Sir.

08:19.449 --> 08:22.467
Mr. Fortune, meet Miss Fidel.

08:23.422 --> 08:24.642
Miss Fidel.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.130
Your Highness.

08:30.446 --> 08:31.783
Apparently,
you’re the new John.

08:31.865 --> 08:34.825
Not meaning a toilet or
prostitute’s client, I take it?

08:34.907 --> 08:38.642
Please don’t pee on me.
I don’t do that anymore.

08:42.129 --> 08:44.513
John didn’t have a personality.

08:44.944 --> 08:46.339
I liked John.

08:46.421 --> 08:49.160
You can call her “John” if it
makes you more comfortable.

08:49.242 --> 08:50.325
He was reliable.

08:50.407 --> 08:52.173
Wasn’t that reliable.

08:52.255 --> 08:56.473
- Heard he got poached by my old team.
- Your old team?

08:56.602 --> 09:00.169
The other leading private contractor
favored by your government.

09:01.176 --> 09:02.543
You worked for Mike?

09:03.142 --> 09:04.985
Mike, the competition Mike?

09:05.069 --> 09:07.813
You may not like Mike,
but Mike is good.

09:08.316 --> 09:10.234
What we got?

09:10.322 --> 09:12.639
Bagman, coming in
on a flight with a hard drive.

09:12.775 --> 09:14.727
We need to track him,
see where he takes it.

09:14.809 --> 09:16.527
I’m gonna
keep an eye on you,

09:16.609 --> 09:18.760
feed you constructive information,
play the right music.

09:18.842 --> 09:21.727
I’ll control the turntables,
you control the dance floor.

09:21.809 --> 09:23.343
Like to dance?

09:24.476 --> 09:25.860
I liked John.

09:25.942 --> 09:28.376
We’ll send him some
flowers on your behalf.

09:40.782 --> 09:42.560
Got anything yet?

09:42.642 --> 09:44.860
Okay, I’m getting somewhere
very slowly.

09:44.942 --> 09:47.176
Still dialing in.
Can you hear it?

09:49.809 --> 09:52.283
Do you actually know
how to use a computer?

09:52.365 --> 09:56.493
Well, I’m sure I can find my way
if you just tell me where the on button is.

09:56.575 --> 09:59.366
Nathan, we’ve been here three hours,
and my feet are hurting.

09:59.448 --> 10:02.340
<i>She’s your responsibility.
She slips up, it’s on you.</i>

10:02.422 --> 10:04.160
I hired her.
I trust her.

10:04.242 --> 10:05.950
We have a three-hour
window, okay?

10:06.032 --> 10:07.598
He’s gotta be with us soon.

10:09.601 --> 10:11.552
In fact, on cue.

10:11.921 --> 10:13.950
- Think I got him.
- About time.

10:14.032 --> 10:16.327
<i>Hiding in that crocodile
should be the drive.</i>

10:16.409 --> 10:18.560
<i>What’s on the drive?
We don’t know.</i>

10:18.642 --> 10:20.727
<i>Orson, just remember
he’s a bagman.</i>

10:20.809 --> 10:24.527
<i>A retired professor,
not a threat or a black belt in Mogadishu.</i>

10:24.609 --> 10:26.493
<i>I’ll try not to
frighten him to death.</i>

10:26.575 --> 10:28.693
<i>We just need to know
who he’s delivering it to.</i>

10:28.823 --> 10:30.441
<i>Whiz kid,
what am I looking for?</i>

10:30.523 --> 10:33.783
Brown hat, spectacles,
crocodile-skin briefcase, upper level.

10:33.865 --> 10:36.627
<i>He should be coming
into your peepers now.</i>

10:36.709 --> 10:39.094
<i>I’m in his phone,
and I’m gonna send him a message.</i>

10:39.176 --> 10:40.366
<i>“Car is delayed.”</i>

10:40.448 --> 10:41.864
<i>- You see him, sweetheart?</i>
- Got him.

10:41.946 --> 10:44.604
<i>Sending him to Luigi’s
Coffee Bar, ground floor.</i>

10:44.922 --> 10:45.950
How do you know
it’s him?

10:46.032 --> 10:47.658
You dance, I’ll play,
remember?

10:47.740 --> 10:49.283
Jane, he’s heading your way.

10:49.365 --> 10:50.742
In position.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.605
JJ, take the B stairs.

10:57.809 --> 10:59.991
He passing me now,
heading to coffee shop.

11:00.073 --> 11:01.313
<i>He’s all yours.</i>

11:05.622 --> 11:07.855
I still see you in position.
Jane, respond.

11:10.490 --> 11:11.843
Jane?

11:11.943 --> 11:13.426
Wakey-wakey, whiz kid.

11:13.508 --> 11:15.408
Orson, I’m getting
no response from Jane.

11:15.490 --> 11:18.466
JJ, keep your peepers peeled
and your hands out of your pockets.

11:18.548 --> 11:21.116
Peepers peeled.
Hands flying free.

11:21.198 --> 11:23.605
Marcia, the job is yours.
Catch him at the counter.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.527
<i>Confirm when
the tracker’s in place.</i>

11:26.609 --> 11:27.875
Moving in now.

11:30.209 --> 11:31.783
Why do I smell
something ratty?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.158
I smell it too.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.063
Marcia, confirm
tracker in place.

11:40.407 --> 11:41.783
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

11:41.865 --> 11:43.593
<i>Confirm tracker in place.</i>

11:43.675 --> 11:46.159
Why do I get the feeling
we’re not the only team in town?

11:46.241 --> 11:48.126
<i>Can’t be. I would know.</i>

11:48.410 --> 11:49.590
Okay, that’s odd.

11:49.865 --> 11:52.326
Either it’s a glitch
in the network or someone’s--

11:52.408 --> 11:53.991
someone is very good.

11:54.073 --> 11:56.033
In my experience,
it’s seldom the network.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.481
<i>Who could do that?</i>

11:59.254 --> 12:00.542
John.

12:01.376 --> 12:02.527
John could do that.

12:02.609 --> 12:04.040
Smells like Team B.

12:04.122 --> 12:06.007
Nathan, what the fuck
are they doing here?

12:06.176 --> 12:09.560
If that weasel John is here,
it means that toad Mike is too.

12:09.642 --> 12:11.022
Stand by.

12:12.740 --> 12:13.560
Nathan.

12:13.642 --> 12:16.158
<i>Mike isn’t
on a different job, is he, sir?</i>

12:16.240 --> 12:19.241
Or is it a coincidence that
his team is at Madrid Airport?

12:19.323 --> 12:22.641
If he’s there,
it isn’t because of my department.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.794
My world works
in a similar fashion to yours.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.426
The government likes to keep
departments competing.

12:27.508 --> 12:29.560
Competition
for the best condition.

12:29.642 --> 12:31.326
Mike only has two talents.

12:31.408 --> 12:33.460
Blowing his cover
and blowing himself.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.242
But thanks for the heads-up.

12:35.742 --> 12:37.150
Orson, confirmed.

12:37.232 --> 12:39.087
<i>Mike is here
to track the crocodile.</i>

12:39.169 --> 12:42.767
Mike’s clumsy and predictable. They’re not
here to track him. They’re here to pick him up.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.408
I’ve resolved the glitch.
We’re going back live.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.366
<i>JJ, change of policy.</i>

12:47.448 --> 12:49.783
Don’t go in, go out.
Exit door F pincer.

12:49.865 --> 12:51.230
On it, boss.

12:54.675 --> 12:56.647
You have two inbound,
8:00 and six o’clock.

12:56.918 --> 12:57.897
Understood.

13:00.323 --> 13:02.355
Just tell me they haven’t
tasered the girls.

13:03.684 --> 13:05.022
Oh, yes, tasered.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.782
Let me feel your rhythm, whiz kid.

13:08.775 --> 13:11.575
- Count me in.
<i>- Three, two, one.</i>

13:23.323 --> 13:25.063
Take a deep breath.
That’s right.

13:32.073 --> 13:33.761
<i>Our man is
en route to exit.</i>

13:33.843 --> 13:35.741
<i>Main gate departures.
Two B’s in pursuit.</i>

13:35.823 --> 13:38.355
<i>I’m on it. I’m exiting
through the parallel doors.</i>

13:40.615 --> 13:44.242
<i>He’s moving to taxi 49502.</i>

13:44.407 --> 13:46.048
- Nathan, you’re needed.
- Incoming.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.367
<i>JJ, your location?</i>

13:47.449 --> 13:49.033
<i>Exiting through
east parallel doors.</i>

13:49.115 --> 13:52.060
- <i>Señor? Hola, señor.</i>
- Mr. Bakker.

13:52.142 --> 13:53.783
Oh, no, no, no.
I cannot come with you.

13:53.865 --> 13:55.603
<i>Two more B’s
posing in the car.</i>

13:55.685 --> 13:57.033
- No, no, please.
- Come with us.

13:57.115 --> 13:58.397
What’s going on?

14:08.157 --> 14:10.694
Heart. Heart. Heart.

14:10.776 --> 14:12.393
JJ, wheel.

14:12.475 --> 14:13.866
Heart.

14:13.948 --> 14:16.022
- What’s wrong with him?
- Don’t know.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.991
- Keeps saying he’s hot.
- No, no. Heart.

14:20.073 --> 14:22.147
Loosen his tie.

14:23.365 --> 14:24.627
He doesn’t feel very hot.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.075
He’s not hot,
you idiots.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.397
He has a
heart condition.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.116
We have two of them
in pursuit.

14:32.198 --> 14:35.033
<i>The drive will be encrypted,
but I can clone it remotely.</i>

14:35.115 --> 14:36.581
Connect me to the hard drive.

14:40.542 --> 14:41.783
We’re roadblocked.

14:41.865 --> 14:44.063
They have my wife.
They will kill her.

14:48.032 --> 14:49.965
JJ, lock the doors.

14:52.654 --> 14:54.605
There’s a dozen of them,
fully armed.

14:55.910 --> 14:58.450
Get out!
Get out of the vehicle, now!

14:58.532 --> 14:59.783
<i>I need more time.</i>

14:59.865 --> 15:01.438
I need another 20 seconds.

15:02.532 --> 15:05.283
They don’t know me, my face.

15:05.408 --> 15:10.355
You go to the Duchess.
Table 12. 6:00 p.m.! Save my wife!

15:18.657 --> 15:20.188
Four.

15:21.865 --> 15:24.522
<i>Three... two...</i>

15:25.461 --> 15:27.063
Open the door!

15:27.687 --> 15:29.897
<i>I’ve got it. Let it go.</i>

15:41.215 --> 15:42.583
We’re gonna need a shovel.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.109
- Nathan.
- Mike.

15:46.735 --> 15:47.897
Nice of you to knock.

15:48.676 --> 15:51.105
- Orson.
- Mike.

15:53.684 --> 15:55.147
That belong to me?

16:02.408 --> 16:03.741
What’d he do
to our friend here?

16:03.823 --> 16:05.866
You scared him to death, Mike.

16:05.948 --> 16:07.380
It’s good, sir.

16:10.154 --> 16:12.522
Second mouse
always gets the cheese, mmm?

16:16.488 --> 16:18.897
Yeah.
Let’s go.

16:19.943 --> 16:21.979
<i>The drive is good,
but it’s scrambled.</i>

16:22.061 --> 16:24.869
<i>Without the data key, it’s useless.
So our best option,</i>

16:24.951 --> 16:27.522
<i>deliver the drive
and find out who the buyer is.</i>

16:37.369 --> 16:40.493
<i>No one interesting has joined
the rooftop in the last 40 minutes.</i>

16:40.575 --> 16:43.980
So whoever you’re there to meet
is already there.

16:46.696 --> 16:50.310
Here we go. Nathan, your file says
you’re terrible at accents. So don’t talk.

16:51.308 --> 16:52.508
Bakker?

16:58.069 --> 16:59.100
This for me?

17:04.575 --> 17:05.859
Have a good evening.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.078
Think I got him.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.407
He’s coming back as Ben Harris.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.810
Ben Harris.

17:14.609 --> 17:18.028
He’s the lawyer/consigliere
to Greg Simmonds.

17:18.109 --> 17:19.367
Who’s Greg Simmonds?

17:19.450 --> 17:21.092
He’s a billionaire arms dealer.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.358
- Only plays in the top tier.
- Greg Simmonds.

17:23.474 --> 17:26.657
Interested in selling 9-mils to kids.
He’s selling Tomahawks to terrorists.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.293
He’s impossible to catch.
Very elusive.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.460
He only uses Ben Harris
on his biggest deals.

17:31.542 --> 17:34.980
And if he’s turned up in person,
speaks for itself.

17:35.870 --> 17:38.193
Oh, hello.
This might be useful.

17:38.275 --> 17:40.198
Greg’s hosting a charity event
in Cannes.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.931
Well, that’s convenient,
’cause we’re also going to Cannes.

17:43.241 --> 17:44.594
Seems he loves an orphan.

17:44.676 --> 17:46.543
Well, he wants to.
He made enough of them.

17:52.475 --> 17:56.328
We’ve picked up some time. So we’ll
be arriving into LA in less than four hours.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.611
LA?

18:02.710 --> 18:07.158
When I put my head down,
we were heading to the south of France.

18:07.240 --> 18:11.368
So, can someone please tell me
why we’re flying to Los Angeles?

18:11.450 --> 18:12.860
The power of “no”,
Nathan.

18:13.837 --> 18:16.393
- I’m sorry?
- Backwards to go forwards.

18:16.475 --> 18:18.618
We’re going to LA
to pick up our invitation.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.908
That being?

18:19.990 --> 18:21.440
Danny Francesco.

18:23.281 --> 18:25.608
Danny Francesco?
The movie star?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.226
- Goddamn it!
- Stunt failed. Reset.

18:32.308 --> 18:35.226
I do the stunts,
you shoot the money.

18:35.308 --> 18:36.610
Wake up, everybody!

18:38.576 --> 18:40.238
Chad, get out
of the fucking car!

18:40.320 --> 18:44.578
Greg Simmonds’s favorite movie star,
Danny Francesco.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.448
And how does that get us in?

18:46.530 --> 18:49.247
You can’t catch this fish
with conventional lures.

18:49.342 --> 18:52.238
Greg wants what everyone wants.
What they can’t have.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.238
There’s nothing he can’t buy
apart from Danny Francesco,

18:55.375 --> 18:58.326
who recently snubbed
a ten-million-dollar offer

18:58.408 --> 19:00.761
to jump out of a cake
and sing him “Happy Birthday.”

19:00.843 --> 19:04.661
He’s obsessed with celebrities,
but more obsessed with their partners.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.948
Sarah will be going
as Danny’s girlfriend.

19:07.030 --> 19:11.112
It’s the fish that can’t be caught, Nathan.
Power of “no.”

19:11.320 --> 19:15.448
And how do we turn this...
movie star’s “no” into a “yes”?

19:15.530 --> 19:17.162
I think we’ve got something.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.108
Blackmail?

19:19.623 --> 19:21.190
Yeah, blackmail.

19:22.476 --> 19:23.814
<i>Ruse de guerre.</i>

19:23.910 --> 19:25.675
Very good. Carry on.

19:25.870 --> 19:28.416
- So, how are you gonna play this?
- I found some spectacular dirt

19:28.498 --> 19:30.794
on the infamous movie producer
Saul Goldstein,

19:30.876 --> 19:32.528
so I pulled him in to help us.

19:32.610 --> 19:34.326
I asked Saul to lure Danny
to Vegas

19:34.408 --> 19:36.326
under the premise
of a five-picture deal.

19:36.408 --> 19:39.886
But as Greg is hosting his charity fundraising
event that we would like to attend,

19:39.968 --> 19:42.650
you’re going to ask Danny
Francesco to come with us instead.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.159
Creative work.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.193
So what have we got
on Danny Francesco?

19:47.275 --> 19:49.509
He’s having an affair
with his sister-in-law.

19:51.134 --> 19:52.502
Told you she was good.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.948
Leave this with me.

19:56.030 --> 19:58.401
Fucking Jesus.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.087
Fucking Swedish.

20:01.415 --> 20:03.366
You kill me, Saul!

20:03.509 --> 20:05.794
Oh, Saul.
You’re a fabulous producer.

20:05.876 --> 20:08.494
I mean, you’re a piece of shit,
but you’re a fabulous producer.

20:08.576 --> 20:10.488
Everybody wants to work with you.
I want to work with you.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.821
But a Swedish accent, Saul?

20:12.909 --> 20:15.528
Come on, I’m an American!

20:15.610 --> 20:17.628
- I can’t do an accent.
- Hello, Natasha.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.394
Danny’s not gonna
need you on this flight.

20:19.476 --> 20:22.488
- Really?
- Yeah. One of those things.

20:22.570 --> 20:27.190
I appreciate that, Danny,
but we need you to do this for us.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.427
“For us”?

20:29.509 --> 20:31.480
What, the royal “us”?
What are you talking about?

20:33.576 --> 20:36.618
I mean, you have
to do this for us.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.899
I have to?

20:39.875 --> 20:42.461
I don’t mean to
contradict you, Saul,

20:42.543 --> 20:44.828
but I don’t have to do
anything for anybody.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.877
And I don’t want to contradict you, Danny,
but we all have to do our bit.

20:49.776 --> 20:51.327
I’m sorry.

20:51.409 --> 20:53.528
I thought you were here
to serve the coffee.

20:53.610 --> 20:56.860
Why do I suddenly feel like I’m
being ganged up on here, Saul?

20:56.942 --> 20:59.400
- Who are you?
- I’m your new manager.

21:01.946 --> 21:03.494
I’m sorry, kid.

21:03.576 --> 21:05.078
They had something
on me too.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.779
Okay, Saul,
where are you going? Saul--

21:08.942 --> 21:11.488
I’m gonna let you converse
with your new manager.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.288
You’re gonna do great, Danny.
You’re a star.

21:14.376 --> 21:16.488
Saul.
Hey, Saul.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.555
- Where do you think you’re go-- This is--
- See you soon.

21:18.643 --> 21:20.394
Saul,
don’t you dare leave the--

21:20.476 --> 21:21.860
Natasha!

21:23.088 --> 21:24.356
Where is Natasha?

21:25.676 --> 21:27.576
Who let this man
on my plane?

21:28.710 --> 21:30.728
Natasha!

21:30.870 --> 21:35.261
- This is my plane!
- Yes, it is, Danny, and it’s a lovely plane.

21:35.343 --> 21:37.528
But you’re gonna have to
trust me for two minutes.

21:37.610 --> 21:40.793
- Why should I?
- Because you’re an actor. You’re a movie star.

21:41.361 --> 21:43.261
Because you’re
a professional.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.776
Imagine we’re in a scene.

21:45.488 --> 21:48.230
Please, sit down.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.238
Are you a patriot?

21:59.320 --> 22:01.448
I don’t vote Republican,
if that’s what you mean.

22:01.530 --> 22:04.663
Okay. Let me give it to you
a different way.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.940
The world needs you
for your greatest role yet.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.560
You and I
are going to a party.

22:12.856 --> 22:13.868
Who are you?

22:13.950 --> 22:16.628
I’m your manager,
Charlie Rosewood.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.900
You’re no longer going to Vegas.
We’re going to Cannes.

22:20.867 --> 22:23.294
No. You are getting off
of my plane,

22:23.376 --> 22:24.727
and Natasha’s
gonna make you.

22:24.809 --> 22:27.368
Natasha! Natasha!

22:27.450 --> 22:28.988
What the fuck
have you done with Natasha?!

22:29.070 --> 22:30.238
Please calm down.

22:32.163 --> 22:36.230
There’s a sensitive and awkward situation
between you and your sister-in-law...

22:37.820 --> 22:39.690
that you probably
shouldn’t have filmed.

22:51.343 --> 22:53.328
I actually love
my sister-in-law.

22:53.410 --> 22:56.060
Yes, Danny.
You’ve made that quite evident.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.268
It turns out everyone thinks
you’re a superstar, Danny.

23:05.576 --> 23:08.628
Once they heard you were in town,
they came to us.

23:09.383 --> 23:10.567
Stop.

23:11.742 --> 23:13.198
I don’t think I can do this.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.508
- No, no, no.
- Danny.

23:14.590 --> 23:15.658
- Nope.
- Danny.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.905
Trust yourself.

23:17.643 --> 23:19.427
No need to be nervous.

23:19.515 --> 23:22.118
No reason to be nervous?
They’re only killers.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.988
We’ve all seen you handle
killers before on-screen.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.738
Fundamentally,
there’s no difference.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.533
What do you think
an agent does?

23:28.615 --> 23:31.714
They act. And no one acts
better than you, Danny.

23:32.530 --> 23:33.908
The best agents are stars,

23:33.990 --> 23:36.790
and the best actors
are movie stars.

23:38.202 --> 23:39.448
I guess that’s sorta true.

23:39.530 --> 23:41.908
You’re an actor. Act.

23:41.990 --> 23:44.408
There’s a big difference
between an actor and a movie star.

23:44.490 --> 23:48.908
- And that is why they’re obsessed with you.
- Yeah.

23:48.990 --> 23:53.357
Well, that and the fact that I didn’t
jump out of a cake for $10 million.

23:56.448 --> 23:57.689
Okay.

23:58.082 --> 24:00.500
While I’m busy playing my part,
what are you two gonna be doing?

24:00.742 --> 24:04.176
We need to get close enough to
Greg Simmonds to remotely access his cell.

24:08.942 --> 24:11.176
Okay.
I’m ready.

24:11.675 --> 24:13.060
Let’s go to work.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.253
<i>Walking on set.</i>

24:46.942 --> 24:48.494
Good.

24:48.576 --> 24:51.309
Remember, you’re not there
to buy anything.

24:52.108 --> 24:55.227
I’m sure
I don’t have to remind you

24:55.309 --> 24:59.578
that you spent the entire
annual budget on wine during the flight over.

24:59.660 --> 25:03.461
<i>So lay off the wine,
concentrate on getting into Greg’s phone,</i>

25:03.543 --> 25:05.693
<i>and identify who’s actually
buying this Handle.</i>

25:05.775 --> 25:08.705
Understood.
Danny, we good?

25:09.242 --> 25:10.727
Good?
Is that a joke?

25:10.809 --> 25:12.527
Remember,
you’re a professional.

25:12.609 --> 25:14.097
You’re playing yourself.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.361
- I-- But I’ve never played myself.
- You can do this.

25:16.443 --> 25:18.127
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Danny.

25:18.209 --> 25:20.727
...lot number 4
from the Quintess Collection

25:20.809 --> 25:23.693
is a pair of diamond
and sapphire earrings.

25:23.775 --> 25:27.327
And a round of applause,
please, for Sir Jonathan Mendes

25:27.409 --> 25:30.527
for the winning bid of $258,000.

25:30.609 --> 25:33.593
...happy ending because he--
he was diagnosed with--

25:33.675 --> 25:35.860
What’s that funny cancer?

25:36.424 --> 25:37.868
Is there a funny cancer?

25:37.950 --> 25:40.427
Can’t remember what it was.
It was something like cock cancer.

25:40.509 --> 25:42.770
And he... he...

25:43.809 --> 25:46.521
- What?
- Will someone pinch me, please?

25:46.740 --> 25:49.060
- Pinch you? Why?
- ’Cause I think I’m dreaming.

25:49.575 --> 25:50.775
Is that...

25:51.775 --> 25:53.793
Is that Danny Francesco?

25:53.875 --> 25:55.328
D’you know what?
I’m a little bit excited.

25:55.410 --> 25:57.460
Oh, I do love Danny Francesco.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.328
Everyone loves Danny Francesco.

25:59.410 --> 26:02.488
I am a little bit starstruck.
I am. It’s not cool, but I am.

26:02.570 --> 26:05.028
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.448
- Hi.
- Nah, I’ll tell you what...

26:07.530 --> 26:10.060
Danny, you like this--
Do you like this piece?

26:12.333 --> 26:13.238
Love it.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.198
<i>It’s one thing
utilizing the expense account</i>

26:15.280 --> 26:17.728
because you have
“psychological” issues.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.948
It’s another thing
bankrupting the department.

26:20.030 --> 26:21.804
What’s he doing here?

26:22.115 --> 26:24.166
Was that you,
Benjamin Bunny?

26:24.262 --> 26:25.948
Not guilty,
Mr. Simmonds.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.328
It was you, wasn’t it?

26:27.410 --> 26:28.658
It’s a surprise, sir.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.618
How much is that fabulous item?

26:31.700 --> 26:33.033
Lot number 15.

26:33.115 --> 26:35.586
$1.5 million.

26:35.668 --> 26:39.527
Lot number 15 from the Habsburg collection.
You like it, Danny?

26:39.609 --> 26:42.408
It’s wonderful.
1.5 million, you say, huh?

26:42.490 --> 26:45.270
Anything Danny buys, he can pay for himself.
He can afford it.

26:46.056 --> 26:46.988
He likes it.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.770
Don’t you fucking dare,
Orson.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.460
- I’ll take it.
<i>- Orson!</i>

26:51.542 --> 26:54.238
Sadly, he can’t.
It’s no longer available.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.400
- Shame.
- It’s not a terrible shame.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.053
It now belongs to you.

26:58.135 --> 27:00.028
Compliments
of Mr. Simmonds.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.493
He’s a big fan.

27:01.575 --> 27:04.127
Mr. Danny Francesco.

27:04.209 --> 27:05.627
Look at you.

27:05.709 --> 27:08.078
The one and only, the legend.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.045
- You’re very kind.
- No, no. I’m Greg Simmonds.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.158
And I wanna thank you
very much

27:12.240 --> 27:15.294
for all the entertainment you’ve
provided us over the years.

27:15.376 --> 27:17.493
- Thank you.
- Well, listen.

27:17.575 --> 27:20.198
It’s a fantastic gesture,
but I can’t accept it.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.120
No, no, you can,
and you can for two reasons.

27:23.202 --> 27:25.007
One, you deserve it.

27:25.089 --> 27:27.270
Two, it’s a fundraiser.

27:29.030 --> 27:32.094
Speaking of which,
would you care to meet

27:32.176 --> 27:35.288
Trent and Arnold,
who are both in biotech?

27:35.370 --> 27:39.118
I don’t wanna be vulgar,
but 22 billion, 17 billion.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.185
Sorry, boys, I didn’t wanna be indiscreet,
but, you know, facts are facts.

27:43.343 --> 27:45.198
And they’re both sponsoring
tonight’s event.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.329
- Hey.
- Big fan.

27:47.411 --> 27:49.288
Oh, thank you.
Great cause.

27:49.370 --> 27:51.070
We try, you know.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.162
Orphans. War.

27:57.322 --> 28:01.118
Let me introduce to you the--
the lovely Michaela.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.810
Well, what an
absolute pleasure.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.158
Pleasure’s all mine.

28:05.240 --> 28:10.060
And can I just say – are we allowed
to say these things now? – wow, wow.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.158
Hello.
What’s your name?

28:13.240 --> 28:15.948
- Charlie Rosewood.
- Hello, Charlie.

28:16.030 --> 28:18.310
My business manager,
Charlie Rosewood.

28:18.844 --> 28:20.100
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure?

28:22.128 --> 28:23.690
You don’t look like
a business manager.

28:25.295 --> 28:26.988
Books, covers.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.118
Oh, yeah.
Well, big book, aren’t ya?

28:29.200 --> 28:31.141
He’s doubled my money
in the last three years.

28:31.223 --> 28:33.527
Is that right?
You got any tips for me, then?

28:33.609 --> 28:35.961
I don’t think you need any tips,
do you, Mr. Simmonds?

28:36.110 --> 28:38.100
You’d be surprised.
I’m very, very greedy.

28:38.498 --> 28:42.310
Well, maybe tonight you’ll be
loosening the purse strings a bit for us.

28:42.715 --> 28:45.138
No tax benefits,
so no chance.

28:45.295 --> 28:47.480
And... Danny doesn’t like kids.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.063
He was kidding.

28:53.836 --> 28:55.574
Well, you’re not wrong.
Actually,

28:55.656 --> 28:59.357
we’ve got two of the war orphans
here tonight, and they’re really annoying.

28:59.439 --> 29:01.360
I don’t want to be pushy,
but there’s a lot of

29:01.442 --> 29:02.727
very interesting people
at this party,

29:02.809 --> 29:04.738
and I would-- I’d--

29:04.820 --> 29:07.553
Emilia, could you
take that for me, me darling?

29:08.276 --> 29:10.172
I would love you
to meet some of them.

29:10.255 --> 29:11.506
Well, I--

29:11.660 --> 29:13.593
Mr. Simmonds,
I would love to.

29:13.675 --> 29:15.333
I just--
I’m actually quite shy.

29:15.450 --> 29:18.118
Danny, it’s the least you can do.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.219
Mr. Simmonds here,
he just spent 1.5 million on you.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.686
Well-- No. To be accurate,
I didn’t spend it on Danny.

29:24.842 --> 29:26.693
I spent it on Michaela.

29:26.775 --> 29:32.078
Suggestion: Why don’t we all
retire to the cocktail master?

29:32.160 --> 29:35.426
That’s what you usually call me,
right, honey?

29:35.508 --> 29:36.690
Minus the “tail.”

29:38.870 --> 29:40.017
She’s--

29:40.110 --> 29:42.288
I don’t think I believe
what I just heard.

29:42.370 --> 29:43.676
I’ll pretend
I didn’t hear that.

29:43.758 --> 29:45.206
Come on,
over to the bar.

29:45.288 --> 29:47.828
You are gonna wash your mouth out.
Come on, Danny.

29:47.910 --> 29:49.709
A generous donation of...

30:01.660 --> 30:03.293
- So I grab him by the balls...
- Yeah, yeah.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.299
...and I say,
“If you speak to her like that again,

30:05.381 --> 30:08.014
I’m gonna rip off your head
and shit down your neck.”

30:08.096 --> 30:11.014
- And I feel something. I feel a little lump.
- Yeah.

30:11.136 --> 30:13.073
Two days later,
he’s diagnosed with testicle cancer.

30:13.155 --> 30:14.146
Oh, my God.

30:14.228 --> 30:17.354
A year later,
he wins his first Tour de France.

30:18.740 --> 30:19.786
- I love that.
- Yeah?

30:19.868 --> 30:21.908
He’s funny, isn’t he?
And he’s naughty too.

30:21.990 --> 30:23.578
Yeah.
Yes.

30:23.660 --> 30:25.611
Go on, then.
Give us some more.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.393
<i>- How are we gonna get to his cell?</i>
- His guard still has it.

30:28.475 --> 30:29.948
We’ve been watching her.
Go find her.

30:30.030 --> 30:31.908
One for the footman, then.

30:31.990 --> 30:34.152
Really?
Why can’t <i>you</i> do it?

30:34.370 --> 30:36.489
You wanted to be
more than a whiz kid.

30:36.609 --> 30:40.020
You wanna get in the field,
get your shoes dirty.

30:40.876 --> 30:42.694
Go on, everyone,
have another cocktail.

30:42.776 --> 30:44.560
Keep him busy. He cost a fortune.
Didn’t you, Jean-Pierre?

30:44.642 --> 30:46.368
Look at that.
Look at that! It’s magic!

30:46.450 --> 30:48.658
That’s it. Do all the monkey business.
That’s it. Flip, flip.

30:48.740 --> 30:51.260
I’ll get yours, Michaela,
while you go to the powder room.

30:51.342 --> 30:52.948
Oh, thank you so much.

30:53.030 --> 30:54.560
It’s not so much magic.
Just a little practice.

30:54.642 --> 30:55.875
I could do that.
Give me ten minutes...

30:55.957 --> 30:58.868
While I powder my nose,
what will you be doing, Mr. Charlie Rosewood?

30:58.950 --> 31:03.349
The waiter behind you was also
at the Madrid Airport.

31:04.370 --> 31:05.988
- Nathan, Mike’s back again.
<i>- I heard.</i>

31:06.070 --> 31:08.198
You deal with Greg.
I’ll handle Mike.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.288
You do your thing, and... I’ll do mine.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.690
Okay, sweetheart.

31:14.876 --> 31:16.527
Go on, then.
Give us some more.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.527
Go back to the dirty ones,
’cause I like them best.

31:18.609 --> 31:20.288
Well, this is gonna
knock your socks off.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.654
Lot number 6
from the Delamont collection

31:22.736 --> 31:25.301
is the one-of-a-kind
blue sapphire...

31:26.451 --> 31:28.607
- Where am I going?
<i>- She’s near his office.</i>

31:28.689 --> 31:30.238
Yes, thank you. I know.
Where is it?

31:30.320 --> 31:32.440
Keep going
and then turn left at the end.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.560
<i>You must stay in range for a couple
of minutes for me to get a lock.</i>

31:37.709 --> 31:39.293
Evening, Nathan.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.288
You got your boys in
to mess things up again?

31:41.370 --> 31:45.527
Mike, nobody likes you,
even your wife.

31:45.609 --> 31:47.560
Well, that’s what
she told me, anyway,

31:47.642 --> 31:50.293
whilst trying to untangle
herself from my chest hairs.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.226
<i>One day
you’ll grow up, Nathan,</i>

31:52.308 --> 31:54.728
and you’ll realize
I’ve got more money,

31:54.810 --> 31:57.094
more men, more intel.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.828
You don’t stand a chance.

31:58.910 --> 32:00.313
<i>In which department?</i>

32:00.395 --> 32:03.059
<i>She did whisper you have
an alarmingly small penis,</i>

32:03.141 --> 32:05.561
<i>and I know you have
an incredibly small brain.</i>

32:05.710 --> 32:07.661
<i>Is it me
that should be worried?</i>

32:07.743 --> 32:10.072
<i>You still running operations
out of the back of your garage?</i>

32:10.154 --> 32:12.032
<i>At least I have an operation.</i>

32:12.114 --> 32:13.973
<i>There’s a difference between
you needing an operation</i>

32:14.055 --> 32:15.421
<i>and me having an operation.</i>

32:15.503 --> 32:17.260
<i>We’re way ahead of you
on this, Nathan.</i>

32:17.342 --> 32:19.032
<i>Outclassed as usual.</i>

32:19.114 --> 32:21.599
<i>You’ll only mess this up like
you do all the others, Mike.</i>

32:22.075 --> 32:23.707
<i>Stay out of my way.</i>

32:26.676 --> 32:28.710
Let’s be a good little buggy.

32:30.342 --> 32:32.142
Okay, what do I do now?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.828
Emilia’s in the room
the other side of that wall.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.770
I can get a lock
if you stand there.

32:40.227 --> 32:43.190
If I get any closer,
my ass is gonna go through it.

32:46.161 --> 32:47.696
JJ, who is this guy?

32:49.656 --> 32:51.238
Hurry up
’cause I’m on him.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.153
<i>Okay, the phone’s on now.</i>

32:59.943 --> 33:01.649
Can I help you?

33:02.094 --> 33:03.313
Oh, hi.

33:03.442 --> 33:05.310
I was just looking
at this painting.

33:08.362 --> 33:09.578
I’m sorry, who are you?

33:09.660 --> 33:10.900
Michaela.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.150
I’m here with Danny Francesco.

33:15.976 --> 33:18.519
That’s it.
I... I saw you earlier.

33:18.843 --> 33:22.530
Greg told me he had this amazing painting,
and he knows I’m an art lover, so...

33:23.508 --> 33:26.158
I actually curate
Mr. Simmonds’s collection.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.408
- No way.
- Yeah. This is actually an original Rhed.

33:29.490 --> 33:31.529
Wow. Rhed with an H.

33:31.611 --> 33:33.151
Wow.

33:33.542 --> 33:37.028
You really know your stuff.
That’s pretty esoteric.

33:37.110 --> 33:38.467
Do you work in the arts?

33:38.549 --> 33:41.980
No, I’m just an enthusiast.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.480
Keep him talking.

33:46.375 --> 33:49.694
I’m always curious about
the philosophical details

33:49.776 --> 33:51.900
behind a collector’s motivation.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.788
We delving
somewhere deep here?

33:54.870 --> 33:56.936
I don’t know. Are we?

34:03.240 --> 34:05.726
<i>All right, JJ.
I didn’t need his life story.</i>

34:05.823 --> 34:08.270
<i>I just wanted his name.
Now disconnect his comms.</i>

34:09.101 --> 34:10.568
Good evening, sir.

34:10.663 --> 34:12.197
Vincent, is it?

34:12.280 --> 34:14.179
Vincent, can I hear Orson?

34:15.780 --> 34:19.100
Relax. Mike cannot
hear this conversation.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.739
- Here you go, Mike. You’ll enjoy this.
- Vincent.

34:25.601 --> 34:26.788
Vincent.

34:26.870 --> 34:28.119
<i>Comms disconnected.</i>

34:28.201 --> 34:29.819
Who’s Mike?

34:30.134 --> 34:32.659
We can play that game
if you wanna, but...

34:33.319 --> 34:35.226
one way or another,

34:35.308 --> 34:36.737
you’re gonna
swim to the shore.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.322
Vincent.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.447
- Please continue.
- Well, I’m interested in

34:42.530 --> 34:46.027
the paradox
of dualistic motivation.

34:46.110 --> 34:48.447
He will try and bribe you.
Don’t listen.

34:48.530 --> 34:52.563
The only question is,
are you gonna do it with a broken nose...

34:54.583 --> 34:56.382
or with your face intact...

34:58.370 --> 34:59.865
and this watch
on your wrist.

34:59.947 --> 35:02.158
<i>The canvas should be a portal</i>

35:02.240 --> 35:06.238
into the abstract,
infinite, life-transcendent,

35:06.320 --> 35:10.238
which, of course,
gives creative expression its inner value.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.253
Mike?
Check in, Mi--

35:13.876 --> 35:15.442
Fuck you, Orson.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.793
Check in.

35:17.943 --> 35:19.559
<i>Where’s the paradox?</i>

35:19.910 --> 35:24.400
The-- The paradox is that
there is beauty in the filth.

35:25.780 --> 35:28.393
- What else have you got?
- Good question.

35:28.475 --> 35:31.576
I admire a man with a
strong sense of self-preservation.

35:35.810 --> 35:38.218
However, there is a limit.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.270
What was wrong
with the watch?

35:47.776 --> 35:51.238
The most beautiful roses come
from the ugliest manure.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.230
I feel like I’m on the couch.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.988
You still got a minute to go.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.347
Anyway, it’s a theory.

36:01.429 --> 36:03.730
I have no idea
if it has any credibility.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.730
Where’d you get that from?
Have you got one for me?

36:26.776 --> 36:29.476
Vincent.
One more chance...

36:30.570 --> 36:32.190
while your nose
is still straight.

36:38.941 --> 36:40.568
What’s it in?

36:41.847 --> 36:42.940
Left or the right?

36:49.796 --> 36:51.158
It was the right.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.190
Now, if you don’t mind,
I’ll take my watch back.

36:54.700 --> 36:56.706
- Yes, Sarah.
<i>- Good work. Wrap it up.</i>

36:56.788 --> 37:01.310
Rich people, if you hadn’t noticed,
they-- they like to show off.

37:01.782 --> 37:03.190
I’m gonna head back.

37:04.275 --> 37:05.643
Great chatting with you.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.118
What’s your name again?

37:08.200 --> 37:10.066
- Michaela.
- Michaela.

37:10.148 --> 37:11.900
- Have a great night.
- You too.

37:14.402 --> 37:16.374
What’s next for Danny Francesco?

37:16.456 --> 37:19.274
- My next film role?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:19.409 --> 37:23.394
Well, I’m playing a mysterious,
self-made billionaire

37:23.476 --> 37:28.628
who goes on a transcendental journey
from material genius to spiritual giant.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.360
Well, that’s a bit spooky, isn’t it?

37:31.942 --> 37:33.520
You just described me.

37:34.155 --> 37:36.078
- I don’t--
- Idea-- Danny, shush. Idea:

37:36.160 --> 37:39.728
Why don’t you come spend
a little bit of time with me

37:39.810 --> 37:43.509
and, you know, do your research,
find your character, all that?

37:44.308 --> 37:45.368
Charlie?

37:45.450 --> 37:47.118
Michaela. Success?

37:47.200 --> 37:49.658
- Of course. Success?
<i>- Success.</i>

37:49.740 --> 37:51.147
Be with you shortly.

37:51.229 --> 37:53.590
<i>Well, I will go rescue
the movie star, then.</i>

38:02.343 --> 38:04.658
Good luck, Vincent.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.528
Michaela, my darling,
your boyfriend wants to use me,

38:08.610 --> 38:11.368
don’t know why,
as inspiration for his next film.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.335
Gave me an idea.

38:13.443 --> 38:15.760
Why don’t you both come
and have a little vacation

38:15.842 --> 38:17.578
in my Turkish villa
this weekend?

38:17.660 --> 38:20.948
And Danny gets to pick up some tips.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.661
Shadow me, you know.

38:22.743 --> 38:24.261
Do whatever I do.

38:24.343 --> 38:26.448
Whatever I do do.
What do I do?

38:26.530 --> 38:27.988
- We’ll find out.
- You will.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.528
Is that a good idea?

38:30.610 --> 38:32.694
I mean, I have
a couple things going on,

38:32.776 --> 38:35.788
but I think
I can rearrange some things.

38:35.870 --> 38:37.860
You, Michaela,
have a lot going on.

38:37.942 --> 38:41.079
- But what about this weekend?
- Oh. Yeah.

38:41.161 --> 38:42.528
Gregory, how are you?

38:42.610 --> 38:44.208
Oh, Lord. Look who’s here.

38:46.543 --> 38:50.126
Well, we’ve been waiting for you
to introduce us to Danny Francesco.

38:50.208 --> 38:53.628
Of course you have. Danny,
I’d like you to meet my very good friends

38:53.710 --> 38:55.760
Alexander and Natalya,

38:55.842 --> 38:57.594
- and big Yiv...
- Alexander.

38:57.676 --> 38:59.494
- ...and the sulky Katya...
- Yes.

38:59.576 --> 39:01.159
...and somewhat scary Dimitry.

39:01.241 --> 39:02.793
- Dimitry, nice to meet you.
- Yes.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.693
Man,
I’m such a fan, you know.

39:04.775 --> 39:06.327
- You mind if I...?
- Selfie?

39:06.409 --> 39:08.092
- Yes.
- Selfie time. Let’s do it.

39:08.174 --> 39:10.193
- Yeah. Be gentle with him.
- Yes...

39:10.275 --> 39:11.793
- Go on, then.
- Danny, please.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.126
- Yes.
- This way. Yeah, good.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.394
- Wait. Wait, wait. Yes.
- Yeah, good. Good.

39:16.476 --> 39:19.194
- This is fantastic. Okay. Everyone, just--
- Yeah.

39:19.276 --> 39:21.408
Why don’t you just crowd
around a little tighter.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.641
- They’re like piranhas, aren’t they?
- Yeah.

39:23.742 --> 39:25.368
Now, that is a feeding frenzy.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.734
- Another one.
- Okay.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.328
- Wait. Not finished yet.
- No, I think we got it.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.650
He’s gonna come out of there
a skeleton.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.693
Very, very nice to meet you.

39:34.775 --> 39:36.710
Just watch where you’re
putting your hands, Dimitry.

39:39.171 --> 39:41.060
Why are you looking at me
like that, Greg?

39:42.610 --> 39:44.810
I think you know why
I’m looking at you like that.

39:46.242 --> 39:48.447
And you know
that I’m spoken for.

39:48.529 --> 39:51.514
Oh, I do, and I respect that.
I do.

39:51.643 --> 39:54.600
But will you allow me
to flatter you for a moment?

39:55.875 --> 39:59.238
Danny is a famous actor,
and that is very impressive.

39:59.320 --> 40:03.604
But actors all work
for someone, don’t they?

40:03.742 --> 40:08.618
You strike me as someone
who doesn’t take orders.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.100
- Well--
- No. Shush, ’cause I’m talking.

40:11.383 --> 40:15.480
I think you’re a... free spirit.

40:16.276 --> 40:19.408
I’m not sure what that means.

40:19.490 --> 40:21.275
It’s been a pleasure.
It’s been an absolute--

40:21.376 --> 40:23.394
You remember in this movie
when you were a kick-ass bad guy?

40:23.476 --> 40:24.809
You’re so good.
I get some--

40:26.280 --> 40:27.480
Come here.

40:30.396 --> 40:31.695
The world...

40:32.329 --> 40:34.885
is a much, much bigger place

40:34.967 --> 40:36.860
than you can possibly imagine.

40:40.086 --> 40:42.186
Allow me to show it to you.

40:50.176 --> 40:52.194
Michaela.

40:52.276 --> 40:53.738
- Hello, Charlie.
- Yes.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.827
- Does our superstar need rescuing?
- Great. Yes.

40:55.909 --> 40:57.427
Hey, Danny.
Shall we?

40:57.509 --> 40:58.968
Michaela.

40:59.543 --> 41:01.100
Think about
what I said, yeah?

41:02.950 --> 41:04.988
Hey, look, Danny.
Your manager is here to save you.

41:05.070 --> 41:07.295
I gotta take him away
before you three birds

41:07.377 --> 41:09.100
chew the meat
off his bones.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.400
- Danny, take my hand.
- Danny. Come on, please!

41:13.809 --> 41:15.368
Hey, Danny, stay! Come on!

41:15.450 --> 41:17.361
- Hey, man. I love you.
- Danny, come back.

41:17.443 --> 41:18.760
- We love you so much.
- Come on.

41:18.842 --> 41:21.160
Danny, you’re my man.
Man, I love you, man.

41:21.242 --> 41:23.160
Look, these beautiful pictures.
Look.

41:23.242 --> 41:25.294
Dimitry,
your tongue is hanging out,

41:25.376 --> 41:26.793
and your hand
is on his cock.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.261
Danny, you should be
proud of yourself.

41:29.343 --> 41:32.642
Yeah, looks like we may be going
away for the weekend with Greggy.

41:34.309 --> 41:37.527
You guys have to stop
doing this to me.

41:37.683 --> 41:40.227
I don’t know if that was the most
exhilarating moment of my life

41:40.309 --> 41:42.127
or the most terrifying
moment of my life,

41:42.209 --> 41:45.227
but Danny Francesco
playing Danny Francesco,

41:45.309 --> 41:46.875
that is the way forward.

42:04.642 --> 42:07.223
<i>Congratulations, team.
A successful evening.</i>

42:07.305 --> 42:09.868
Debrief at 0700.
Good work.

42:09.950 --> 42:12.227
<i>Well, well, Greg.</i>

42:12.309 --> 42:13.738
<i>Well, Alexander,</i>

42:13.820 --> 42:17.198
at your new, improved
summer sale price

42:17.280 --> 42:20.020
that is the $10 billion...

42:21.476 --> 42:22.727
we have a deal.

42:22.809 --> 42:25.675
Fantastic!

42:26.316 --> 42:28.440
So, who’s buying?

42:29.780 --> 42:32.493
<i>No, not telling you that.</i>

42:32.575 --> 42:36.056
My job is to protect
every link in this chain.

42:36.138 --> 42:40.118
So I do protect them, yes,
but I’m also protecting you.

42:40.200 --> 42:44.484
So what happens now is that I
tell them that you are delighted,

42:44.642 --> 42:48.020
and they will be delighted,
and then we can all be delighted together.

42:48.948 --> 42:49.988
We should celebrate now.

42:50.070 --> 42:52.360
We should.
Emilia.

42:53.157 --> 42:55.460
Get one of them really stupid
bottles of vodka.

42:55.542 --> 42:58.394
You know,
the one with the five-carat rock in the top.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.157
You’ll love that.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.593
I do wish you’d communicate
with your other departments.

43:04.675 --> 43:08.127
Someone is feeding Mike
information, inside information.

43:08.209 --> 43:11.488
<i>It doesn’t look like Mike is working
for anyone in this government.</i>

43:11.570 --> 43:14.770
I’ll need more time to find out
which government he’s working for.

43:15.709 --> 43:18.020
Now, tell me what you have.

43:18.990 --> 43:20.764
We still can’t confirm
it’s the Handle.

43:20.846 --> 43:24.599
What we do know is that Alexander
is selling something for $10 billion.

43:25.032 --> 43:26.727
<i>Greg Simmonds
is brokering the deal.</i>

43:26.809 --> 43:28.060
And who’s the buyer?

43:28.775 --> 43:30.561
Still a mystery.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.657
But it won’t remain one for long.

43:36.282 --> 43:38.029
Well, I think Orson is right.

43:38.111 --> 43:42.027
Greg has a thing
for stealing girlfriends,

43:42.109 --> 43:43.618
especially from movie stars.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.727
So accept his offer to go away.

43:45.809 --> 43:47.727
That’s a vulnerable position.

43:47.809 --> 43:50.448
I’ve dealt with much worse than
Greg Simmonds before, believe me.

43:50.530 --> 43:51.522
Vulnerable?

43:51.604 --> 43:54.528
Just be aware if they need to get out
quick, it might not be that easy.

43:54.610 --> 43:56.628
At some point,
the movie star’s gonna melt.

43:56.742 --> 43:58.067
I’m sure he’ll be fine.

43:58.149 --> 44:00.200
What did you find
on Trent and Arnold?

44:00.282 --> 44:03.238
Our biotech billionaires are
buying up an awful lot of gold.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.031
Other than that,
not a great deal.

44:05.113 --> 44:07.658
At least we know that
Alexander and his friends are involved.

44:07.740 --> 44:09.999
Whatever they’re selling
has now got Greg very excited.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.627
Yeah. I found out
where they’re staying,

44:11.709 --> 44:13.293
but their computers
are impossible to hack.

44:13.375 --> 44:15.246
I don’t know how long
it’s gonna take me to get in.

44:15.328 --> 44:16.230
Options?

44:17.198 --> 44:20.658
Quickest way is to physically install
software on their computers.

44:20.740 --> 44:23.972
You mean break in
and install via a thumb drive?

44:24.054 --> 44:27.788
- Yes, that’s the most direct way to do it.
- This one’s for you, then.

44:27.870 --> 44:30.828
- Really? I thought I was the footman.
- No, a tech whiz.

44:30.910 --> 44:32.861
- Yeah, and you’re the hammer.
- Hammer?

44:32.950 --> 44:36.244
- If there’s a problem, I’ll do it.
- No, there’s not a problem, JJ.

44:36.905 --> 44:37.980
I’ll do it.

44:38.242 --> 44:40.028
I can get
inside Alexander’s.

44:40.110 --> 44:42.860
I hope you take him to dinner first.

44:43.950 --> 44:46.117
Before you get inside of him.

44:46.308 --> 44:49.190
S... Se--

44:56.476 --> 44:58.940
<i>You are over the wall.
Neatly done.</i>

45:03.055 --> 45:05.522
And we are redirecting
the air con.

45:20.469 --> 45:23.713
And they’re all
sleeping like babies now.

45:23.795 --> 45:25.810
They’re not gonna
wake up anytime soon.

45:26.094 --> 45:28.310
<i>You are safe to enter.</i>

45:39.329 --> 45:40.740
<i>Doors opening now.</i>

45:47.202 --> 45:49.860
Up the stairs, first floor,
bedroom on the left.

45:58.021 --> 45:59.732
<i>Once you’ve installed
the thumb drive,</i>

45:59.814 --> 46:02.433
<i>cover your tracks
and make it look like a robbery.</i>

46:02.655 --> 46:04.027
<i>Swag some watches,</i>

46:04.109 --> 46:07.184
<i>crack the safe
and bag some cash, baby.</i>

46:07.476 --> 46:09.809
<i>The more you bag,
the better it looks.</i>

46:28.407 --> 46:31.690
<i>No time to watch TV, sweetheart.
Get to work.</i>

47:29.595 --> 47:31.279
<i>Find the laptop?</i>

47:31.361 --> 47:32.401
Found.

47:33.370 --> 47:37.730
And now I’d like you to
plug in that drive and slap enter.

47:38.573 --> 47:41.150
<i>Whatever they control,
I can control better.</i>

47:41.594 --> 47:44.060
<i>We have full access
to their computer.</i>

47:45.509 --> 47:49.360
Now that you’ve sucked it dry,
return to safe.

48:01.990 --> 48:04.288
There are still
two guards patrolling.

48:04.370 --> 48:06.389
<i>Exit via the front door.</i>

48:10.700 --> 48:13.020
Nicely done, sweetheart.
We’ll pick you up at the front gate.

48:23.368 --> 48:24.735
Don’t move!

48:30.062 --> 48:31.393
Don’t--

48:52.541 --> 48:53.480
What’s that?

48:54.243 --> 48:55.400
It’s a guard dog.

48:56.221 --> 48:58.473
Guard, dog.

48:59.042 --> 49:01.448
- I’m good with a dog.
- Lucky, that.

49:02.574 --> 49:04.392
- What about your mate?
- Power nap.

49:04.728 --> 49:05.869
He’ll be all right
in a minute.

49:05.951 --> 49:07.940
Okay, are you guys done?
I heard a gunshot.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.476
- Is anyone dead?
- No.

49:13.608 --> 49:14.658
No thanks to you.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.868
- What?
- You said it was clear.

49:16.950 --> 49:20.408
- I said the front was clear.
- I came out the front.

49:20.490 --> 49:23.133
Yeah, you know, they usually keep
the Olympic-size swimming pools

49:23.215 --> 49:24.400
in the back of the house.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.028
Front, back,
right, wrong.

49:35.110 --> 49:36.239
“Right, wrong.”

49:36.321 --> 49:37.572
Whatever.

49:37.654 --> 49:39.060
Anyway, shall we?

49:47.307 --> 49:48.767
- JJ.
- Sir.

49:48.849 --> 49:50.360
- Morning.
- Morning.

49:50.442 --> 49:52.232
Sarah says I didn’t
miss much last night.

49:52.314 --> 49:54.520
- In and out.
- So you weren’t seen by anyone?

49:54.602 --> 49:56.980
- Yes.
- That’s a yes, you weren’t seen by anyone?

49:57.810 --> 50:00.310
- Yes.
- Or a yes, you were seen by someone?

50:01.215 --> 50:03.078
- Yes.
- Childish.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.994
Nothing you need to
worry about, Nathan.

50:05.076 --> 50:07.526
You just concentrate on your
gluten-free, lactose-intolerant,

50:07.608 --> 50:08.730
bunny-stroking breakfast.

50:08.954 --> 50:09.828
Boys, done?

50:09.910 --> 50:12.254
I pulled this off
of Alexander’s laptop.

50:12.336 --> 50:14.709
Looks like the deal’s
all agreed to on their side,

50:14.791 --> 50:16.896
and there’s an escrow account
linked.

50:16.978 --> 50:19.528
- What are they selling?
- We still don’t know.

50:19.610 --> 50:20.829
So we could be
wasting our time.

50:21.139 --> 50:22.560
Activity on Greg’s phone.

50:22.874 --> 50:24.940
<i>- Yes?
- Greg, you’re on speaker.</i>

50:25.195 --> 50:28.488
I’m with Arnold, enjoying
the view from up here.

50:28.570 --> 50:31.738
<i>You’re back in Disneyland already?
Didn’t hang about, did you?</i>

50:31.820 --> 50:33.698
What’d you do,
beam yourselves there?

50:33.780 --> 50:37.023
Don’t go mad, darling.
Yesterday I looked like fucking candy.

50:37.370 --> 50:38.987
You’re lucky
we made your party at all.

50:39.069 --> 50:42.698
- Your choice of friends is questionable.
<i>- You’re not wrong.</i>

50:42.780 --> 50:46.540
But I’d argue that they
are acquaintances, not friends.

50:46.622 --> 50:49.041
And yes, we did raise
a lot of money for the war orphans.

50:49.176 --> 50:50.658
Thank you for caring.

50:50.740 --> 50:52.819
Put a load of rich lowbrows
in a room together,

50:52.901 --> 50:55.236
they’ll always outbid
one another in the name of

50:55.318 --> 50:57.529
egotistical competition
and ostentation.

50:57.611 --> 50:59.828
Which is kind of the point, Trent.

50:59.910 --> 51:02.586
<i>Didn’t have you down
as an angry anti-capitalist.</i>

51:02.668 --> 51:04.954
No, we are anti-capitalist.

51:05.143 --> 51:07.360
Anti-other-capitalists.

51:08.150 --> 51:10.261
I’ll tell you what, boys.
I’ve got another call coming in.

51:10.343 --> 51:11.826
- Thank you, my darling.
- Thank you, sir.

51:11.908 --> 51:13.228
<i>You better take it, then.</i>

51:13.310 --> 51:14.868
So what was the point
of this one?

51:14.950 --> 51:16.936
Just to check we’re okay.

51:17.076 --> 51:18.673
<i>Yes, we are okay.</i>

51:18.755 --> 51:21.640
<i>Just remember,
yellow is the color and gold is the game.</i>

51:22.200 --> 51:24.693
- And I still love you.
- We’ll speak later.

51:24.775 --> 51:26.150
Hello, Qasim.

51:27.820 --> 51:28.797
<i>Go on.</i>

51:28.879 --> 51:30.659
I’ve just spoken to Aleksander.

51:30.741 --> 51:32.588
And? Everything set?

51:32.670 --> 51:35.788
<i>It’s not easy getting an answer
out of him. He’s in a terrible mood.</i>

51:35.870 --> 51:36.980
<i>Why?</i>

51:37.244 --> 51:39.656
You know he prides himself
on his security?

51:40.407 --> 51:42.480
A lone cat burglar got in last night.

51:42.782 --> 51:46.190
<i>Gassed the house.
Cleared out all his cash and jewelry.</i>

51:47.280 --> 51:50.650
<i>On leaving, Alexander’s personal guards
stopped him.</i>

51:50.922 --> 51:51.940
Don’t move!

51:53.820 --> 51:54.900
I will shoot you.

51:56.818 --> 51:58.824
Don’t shoot! Don’t hurt me.

51:59.030 --> 52:00.908
Come on. I--
Take my hands!

52:00.990 --> 52:02.618
Hospitalized two of his guards.

52:02.700 --> 52:05.288
No police. No prison.
I’ve got kids!

52:05.370 --> 52:06.698
One with the broken nose...

52:06.780 --> 52:08.699
- Sir. Sorry, sir.
<i>- ...three cracked ribs...</i>

52:08.781 --> 52:11.127
He’s crying for mama.
Not a problem.

52:11.209 --> 52:12.730
<i>...and two fucked nuts.</i>

52:30.240 --> 52:31.810
Another one,
a bullet in the foot.

52:32.176 --> 52:33.440
You shot my foot!

52:34.942 --> 52:36.693
No cry for mama.

52:38.542 --> 52:40.900
This is the kind of thing
I need to know about.

52:41.809 --> 52:43.362
You dropped
your chopsticks.

52:43.444 --> 52:44.738
You got shit on your face.

52:44.820 --> 52:45.789
<i>Should I be worried?</i>

52:45.871 --> 52:47.529
<i>We’re going to carry on.</i>

52:47.611 --> 52:49.478
I’m waiting on confirmation.

52:49.979 --> 52:52.618
But they should be flying fowl
in 72 hours.

52:52.700 --> 52:55.028
<i>You keep me informed, Qasim.</i>

52:55.110 --> 52:56.658
<i>Goody goody then.</i>

52:56.740 --> 52:59.368
“Flying fowl” in 72 hours?
What the cuss does that mean?

52:59.450 --> 53:01.408
I got a location
on Qasim’s phone.

53:01.490 --> 53:04.857
If Alexander and his team are entering another
country illegally, they’re gonna need help

53:04.944 --> 53:07.861
avoiding any risks with the authorities.

53:07.943 --> 53:09.641
So where’s this Qasim based?

53:09.730 --> 53:12.856
Antalya, Turkey.
Gobble, gobble.

53:12.938 --> 53:15.782
That’s “flying fowl”
with a W, not a U.

53:15.952 --> 53:20.650
Turkey borders Ukraine.
Hence “flying fowl,” flying to Turkey.

53:21.042 --> 53:22.028
Bit of a reach.

53:22.110 --> 53:25.830
You’d think so,
except Qasim Amari is a diplomat

53:25.912 --> 53:28.677
located in the Turkish
government’s office in Antalya, Turkey.

53:28.759 --> 53:31.440
- I don’t know how I do it.
- What a brain.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.659
Do I have a brain in there?
Oh, she does.

53:34.741 --> 53:37.368
Modern women.
What will they think of next?

53:37.450 --> 53:40.158
- So, looks like we’re all flying fowl.
- Amazing.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.626
We’ll track Qasim,
see where he leads us.

53:42.708 --> 53:44.625
Sarah, you go with Danny
as planned

53:44.708 --> 53:46.880
and find out from Greg
exactly what it is he’s buying.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.440
We need a
confirmation on that.

53:48.775 --> 53:52.060
Explains why Greggy’s spending
his weekend in Turkey.

53:59.504 --> 54:02.400
There’s a term for being beaten
in four moves, Nathan:

54:03.442 --> 54:06.238
- Fool’s Mate.
- Wasn’t four moves.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.192
If you can get yourself out
of that little mess I put you in,

54:09.274 --> 54:11.020
you can have
a glass of this.

54:11.328 --> 54:13.362
What we got on Qasim, JJ?

54:13.970 --> 54:16.440
Libyan diplomat based
all over the world.

54:16.680 --> 54:20.651
Met Greg Simmonds in the 2000s,
who put him on the payroll soon after.

54:20.733 --> 54:24.288
Qasim’s been greasing palms and
burying bodies for Greg ever since.

54:24.370 --> 54:26.532
Nice work.

54:26.614 --> 54:28.618
- Have a glass of this.
- Wine’s not really my thing.

54:28.700 --> 54:29.868
Is that the 2004?

54:29.950 --> 54:32.190
Who’s talking to you?
Aren’t you busy enough?

54:33.610 --> 54:35.260
There’s wine
and then there’s wine.

54:35.342 --> 54:37.190
Don’t force the poor man.

54:44.370 --> 54:46.940
Congratulations,
Dr. Frankenstein.

54:47.022 --> 54:48.659
You’ve created
another monster.

54:48.741 --> 54:52.641
Nathan, you don’t put
fish fat oil in a Ferrari.

55:14.136 --> 55:16.223
Ah, little Miss Paradox.

55:16.583 --> 55:18.143
She got in your head yet?

55:19.589 --> 55:21.954
- Hey, good to see ya.
- You too.

55:22.036 --> 55:24.698
There they are,
my new best friends.

55:25.460 --> 55:28.100
<i>Hosgeldiniz,</i>
as we say in Turkey.

55:28.891 --> 55:29.988
Thank you
for the jet.

55:30.070 --> 55:32.329
Oh, don’t be silly.
That’s the baby one.

55:32.411 --> 55:35.100
- Danny Francesco, yeah.
- It’s good to see you, Greg.

55:35.365 --> 55:37.409
Excited to be here,
learn from the master.

55:37.491 --> 55:40.118
Oh, no, I’m not the master.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.960
Now, before
we do anything else,

55:42.042 --> 55:44.233
follow me ’cause I have
something to show you.

55:44.315 --> 55:46.300
Grab a drink on the way.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.586
’75 Corniche, Greggy.
I love it.

55:48.668 --> 55:51.367
Yeah, it’s nice, isn’t it?
Present from Elton, that one.

55:53.375 --> 55:55.638
Wait a second.
That looks exactly like the car that I drove--

55:55.720 --> 55:57.616
Do you know why?
Do you know why?

55:58.610 --> 56:01.253
- That’s not possible.
- Oh, yeah.

56:01.335 --> 56:02.520
Oh, yeah, it is.

56:02.602 --> 56:05.052
Lovingly restored
with me own hands.

56:05.375 --> 56:06.961
It’s not really
with me own hands.

56:07.043 --> 56:08.511
I’m just joking.

56:08.662 --> 56:10.695
- It’s nice though, isn’t it?
- I--

56:13.070 --> 56:14.360
Look at him.

56:15.108 --> 56:17.340
- I drove this car myself.
- I know, honey.

56:17.422 --> 56:19.579
And, Michaela,
did his own stunts.

56:19.661 --> 56:21.620
- Is that true, Danny?
- Yeah.

56:21.702 --> 56:24.698
- Could you still do ’em?
- I’m a little rusty, but sure.

56:24.780 --> 56:27.860
Right, game on.
After lunch, yes?

56:28.102 --> 56:31.359
Okay. I might have to sit that one out,
but you boys have fun.

56:31.441 --> 56:34.580
After lunch, Michaela,
you are having the pleasure

56:34.662 --> 56:38.834
of a four-hands, hot stones massage
with Suki and Sasha.

56:38.916 --> 56:42.834
And they really, really understand
a lady’s geography.

56:43.081 --> 56:44.270
Isn’t that right,
Emilia?

56:44.816 --> 56:45.788
Yes, they do.

56:45.870 --> 56:47.198
Sounds fabulous.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.002
- She looks nervous.
- Oh, believe me, I’m not.

56:50.985 --> 56:52.235
You even have
my prop gun!

56:52.317 --> 56:55.360
Yeah, yeah, it is. But it’s not a prop
anymore, Danny, so steady, yeah?

56:56.669 --> 56:58.386
- I cannot believe you got this car.
- Yeah.

56:58.468 --> 57:00.860
- I wanted this car so bad.
- Did you? Did you?

57:01.949 --> 57:03.400
How much did you want it,
Danny?

57:04.091 --> 57:06.227
Of all the cars
I’ve driven on-screen,

57:06.309 --> 57:08.289
this is the only car
I wanted to possess.

57:08.371 --> 57:11.908
- Is that right? Did you crave it?
- Yeah.

57:11.990 --> 57:14.288
- Did you yearn for it?
- Yeah.

57:14.370 --> 57:16.060
Did you dream about it?

57:16.662 --> 57:17.980
I longed for it.

57:18.449 --> 57:19.933
Do you know what?

57:20.195 --> 57:21.980
It’s yours.
Come on, let’s have lunch.

57:23.622 --> 57:25.403
- What?
- It’s yours.

57:28.468 --> 57:29.886
Come on!

57:31.998 --> 57:33.980
- All right.
- Do you like kebabs?

57:36.442 --> 57:37.621
What’s in the bag?

57:37.703 --> 57:38.920
Nothing.

57:39.055 --> 57:41.507
So you’re carrying an empty bag?

57:41.648 --> 57:43.079
You nicked the Margaux,
didn’t ya?

57:43.161 --> 57:44.934
“Nicked”
is a little bit strong.

57:45.016 --> 57:47.099
Leaving half a bottle
of Margaux on a plane?

57:47.235 --> 57:48.619
So you’re
a doggie bag man.

57:48.701 --> 57:49.906
Do you have any idea
what it costs?

57:49.988 --> 57:51.788
He has no idea
how much it costs.

57:51.870 --> 57:54.521
Short arms, long pockets.
Room keys.

57:54.616 --> 57:56.132
Meet down here
in 60 minutes?

57:56.214 --> 57:58.270
We’re off to track the Libyan.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.693
- What are you doing? That’s my key.
- I know what it is.

58:02.775 --> 58:04.578
I also know you’ve given
yourself the biggest room.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.480
How do you know
I haven’t already switched them?

58:07.209 --> 58:08.360
Fuck off, Nathan.

58:09.015 --> 58:10.810
You haven’t got
the bandwidth for that.

58:12.175 --> 58:16.533
I can’t believe it.
I’m in the car with the actor.

58:16.615 --> 58:18.866
Is the back end still bulletproof?
It feels a little squirrelly.

58:18.948 --> 58:20.799
Oh, yeah.
Unique selling point.

58:20.881 --> 58:24.554
So, tell me, how did the leap from
millionaire to billionaire change you?

58:24.636 --> 58:26.521
Right. Interesting question

58:26.616 --> 58:31.119
and, I imagine,
my cue to say money doesn’t make you happier.

58:31.201 --> 58:34.304
I’ll tell you what, Danny,
it fucking does.

58:34.386 --> 58:38.711
It does. I’m really happy now
and-- and a nicer person too.

58:38.802 --> 58:40.740
I worry about things.
I worry about the world.

58:40.822 --> 58:42.295
I worry about
the war orphans.

58:42.382 --> 58:44.397
You don’t strike me
as a worrier, Greg.

58:44.483 --> 58:46.225
Yeah, well,
you don’t strike me

58:46.307 --> 58:48.801
as someone who drives like
a little girlie, but you do.

58:48.883 --> 58:50.500
Oh, is that how it is?

58:53.142 --> 58:55.239
Slow down, Danny Francesco.

58:55.321 --> 58:58.782
You are driving me
into my dreams!

59:22.355 --> 59:24.520
Everything all right,
Michaela?

59:25.496 --> 59:29.595
Yeah. Oh, my God,
this place is massive.

59:30.262 --> 59:33.325
And wow,
this piece is beautiful.

59:33.958 --> 59:35.238
Mimar Sinan.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.672
- Are you looking for your room?
- Yes.

59:37.843 --> 59:40.440
My room is that way.

59:40.709 --> 59:41.989
It’s actually the other way.

59:42.071 --> 59:43.396
Of course.

59:43.482 --> 59:46.328
Down the corridor, turn right,
and it’s on your left.

59:46.410 --> 59:48.872
Hey, that massage
was so good, by the way.

59:48.954 --> 59:51.489
- Y-You should join us next time.
- Turn right.

59:51.571 --> 59:53.755
Right. Got it.

59:53.921 --> 59:55.400
Okay, I’ll see you later.

01:00:07.449 --> 01:00:08.497
Qasim’s out.

01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:10.690
- We following?
- Not yet.

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:15.599
Looks like he’s en route for a coffee.

01:00:22.868 --> 01:00:25.360
Oh, hello.
How does he do it?

01:00:25.988 --> 01:00:26.949
Mike?

01:00:27.031 --> 01:00:29.118
Doesn’t matter
how he’s done it. He’s done it.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.560
- It’s Mike, isn’t it?
- How’s he getting his information?

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:34.327
<i>Ground control?</i>

01:00:34.409 --> 01:00:37.060
- Can you hear me, Major Tom?
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

01:00:37.948 --> 01:00:39.515
<i>How are we getting on?</i>

01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:41.908
Looping monitor.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.287
They have some sort
of adolescent firewall.

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:46.560
It’s taking me about a minute
to perforate it.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.375
Done.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.078
Looks like he’s had enough
of that paper.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.369
Qasim’s off,
and Mike’s going with him.

01:00:57.451 --> 01:01:00.288
- We following?
- No, let Mike play that game.

01:01:00.652 --> 01:01:01.948
My money’s on the paper.

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.015
Whatever you say, boss.

01:01:04.296 --> 01:01:05.480
You want an ice cream?

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.948
And I am in.

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.097
Great.

01:01:17.709 --> 01:01:18.900
What’s he buying?

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:20.400
Hold on.

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.948
I picked up a file
sent by Qasim.

01:01:23.175 --> 01:01:24.860
He’s using RSA encryption.

01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:29.680
- Well, that’s disappointing.
<i>- What?</i>

01:01:29.762 --> 01:01:32.819
Well, it looks like
Greg’s up to no good. But...

01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.118
not spectacularly no good,
just no good.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.454
Don’t be mean, Sarah.
Give me something.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.408
Greg is buying containers
of stolen AK-47s.

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:43.342
Yes, very funny.
Now, seriously, what is it?

01:01:43.676 --> 01:01:45.400
No, I am serious.

01:01:45.676 --> 01:01:47.213
<i>We’ve got it wrong.</i>

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:48.763
<i>See for yourself.</i>

01:01:56.622 --> 01:01:57.908
Oh, hello.

01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:59.360
We’ve seen him before.

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:05.448
- Shall we?
- I’ll get the ice creams, you get the wheel.

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.101
<i>Can’t be, Sarah.</i>

01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:10.067
<i>All that fuss over
30 million dollars’ worth of guns?</i>

01:02:10.149 --> 01:02:12.140
<i>It’s too small a crime
for too big a player.</i>

01:02:12.222 --> 01:02:14.334
<i>If it’s a cover,
it’s a very good one.</i>

01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:17.207
<i>It’s enough evidence to feel his collar,
but not enough to choke him with it.</i>

01:02:17.289 --> 01:02:18.739
Understood, but

01:02:18.821 --> 01:02:22.133
<i>there’s nothing linking
this deal to the Handle.</i>

01:02:22.215 --> 01:02:25.289
Pooh. All right, get out of there
and get back as soon as you can.

01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:27.831
Let me just dig a bit deeper and

01:02:28.264 --> 01:02:31.167
find some evidence we
can hold over him for a rainy day.

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.360
<i>Okay, but be quick.</i>

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.440
- Orson, you there?
<i>- What is it?</i>

01:02:36.522 --> 01:02:38.488
Time to come in.
We were wrong.

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.732
<i>It’s not the Handle, it’s firearms.
We’re following the wrong rabbit.</i>

01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:43.789
You go back to bed.
Leave this with me.

01:02:43.871 --> 01:02:45.619
<i>Sarah’s shown me proof.</i>

01:02:45.701 --> 01:02:47.230
Forget it. We’re done.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:48.990
I don’t think so.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:52.118
We’re back with
our old friend Ben Harris.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.984
If Greg has Ben involved,

01:02:54.068 --> 01:02:57.187
there’s no way that this deal
is about guns.

01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:59.726
<i>All right.
Follow him, but do not engage.</i>

01:02:59.808 --> 01:03:01.480
<i>I’ll let Sarah know
we’re still in play.</i>

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:13.310
<i>You got me, JJ?</i>

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:16.310
I’ve got
a lock on you, boss.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.961
<i>- Do we pick him up?</i>
- No.

01:03:28.548 --> 01:03:29.900
Cat follows mouse.

01:03:42.442 --> 01:03:45.118
<i>- Can you get a lock onto his phone?</i>
- Yeah, if you get close enough.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.107
<i>Stay within 50 meters.</i>

01:03:47.189 --> 01:03:49.368
<i>I can use your phone
to lock onto his signal.</i>

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.659
Quicker if he uses it.

01:03:50.741 --> 01:03:52.448
Get close enough
to raise suspicion,

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.681
<i>but not too close so he bolts.</i>

01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.860
<i>That will initiate him
activating his phone.</i>

01:04:01.023 --> 01:04:02.589
Are we being followed?

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.139
<i>He sent a text.
I blocked it.</i>

01:04:13.554 --> 01:04:15.690
I’ve got him. I’ve locked on.

01:04:16.157 --> 01:04:17.480
I’ve blocked his call.

01:04:19.328 --> 01:04:21.150
Can’t get through.
No signal.

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.648
- Deal with that.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:28.475 --> 01:04:29.894
Lost?

01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:32.154
Thank you, sir.
Maybe you can help me.

01:04:32.555 --> 01:04:34.440
I’m looking for the harbor.

01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:36.073
This way, sir.

01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:44.650
<i>Hang on. I’ve just
jammed another message.</i>

01:04:46.388 --> 01:04:48.270
We’re burned.
He’s recognized ya.

01:04:50.568 --> 01:04:51.768
That’s strange,

01:04:52.781 --> 01:04:54.032
’cause...

01:04:54.411 --> 01:04:56.099
according to the map,

01:04:56.514 --> 01:04:57.834
it says this way.

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.284
No. This way, sir.

01:05:04.615 --> 01:05:05.579
Amazing.

01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:08.560
You’re absolutely right.
Thank you.

01:05:23.278 --> 01:05:25.060
Got to pick him up.
He’s gonna run.

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:42.310
<i>Orson, if he gets out of range,
I can’t block his signal. Get after him.</i>

01:05:52.221 --> 01:05:54.368
<i>He’s in the building on the left.</i>

01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:06.600
<i>He’s ten meters, straight on.</i>

01:06:11.876 --> 01:06:13.003
Hey!

01:06:16.155 --> 01:06:17.730
JJ, he’s on two wheels.
Talk to me.

01:06:18.376 --> 01:06:19.810
15 meters,
take a right.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.585
- Left or right, JJ?
<i>- Sharp left.</i>

01:06:32.473 --> 01:06:33.690
He’s getting out of range.

01:06:59.629 --> 01:07:02.078
- <i>JJ, speak to me.</i>
- He’s stopped moving.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.956
<i>He’s right in front of ya.</i>

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:12.310
- Missed him. Stairs?
<i>- Take a right.</i>

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:23.494
Afternoon.

01:07:29.775 --> 01:07:31.115
Excuse me.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.730
Can you take a picture
of me and the view?

01:07:35.808 --> 01:07:38.194
They’re only stairs.
Go on, move yourself.

01:07:38.276 --> 01:07:40.150
<i>Next time, I’ll sit in the car.
You do the chasing.</i>

01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:42.530
Let me take a look.

01:07:45.755 --> 01:07:47.007
Oh, beautiful.

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.060
Give me your phone.
Let me take one of you.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.108
<i>He’s still there.</i>

01:08:02.782 --> 01:08:05.867
- There’s no one here.
<i>- I’m telling ya, he’s right there.</i>

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:07.983
<i>You’re on top of his phone now.</i>

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:11.948
Ah, Jesus.
What did he do that for?

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.600
<i>Hold on,
I’m just pulling up.</i>

01:08:14.314 --> 01:08:18.238
<i>There’s a body all over the floor
200 feet below me. It’s Harris.</i>

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:19.694
Get the phone,

01:08:20.046 --> 01:08:21.502
the paper...

01:08:22.952 --> 01:08:24.845
and get the body in the back.

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:30.770
That isn’t Ben Harris.

01:08:31.522 --> 01:08:33.913
What do you mean, it’s not Ben Harris?

01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:42.600
That’s Ben Harris.

01:08:53.331 --> 01:08:54.814
Is he in the back?

01:08:54.908 --> 01:08:56.474
Yeah, he’s in the back.

01:09:01.219 --> 01:09:03.899
<i>So, Nathan, can you now confirm?</i>

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.907
<i>The file Sarah extracted
from Greg’s computer</i>

01:09:07.988 --> 01:09:10.948
<i>was actually the data key
that unlocked the Bakker drive,</i>

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:12.698
confirming it is the Handle.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:13.894
So what is it?

01:09:13.975 --> 01:09:17.439
The first of its kind
programmable AI.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.040
Our people had hoped
it was still in the post,

01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:24.073
but now it seems
the post has been delivered.

01:09:24.276 --> 01:09:27.828
It can hack any system,
even other AI programs.

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:29.948
- With what end?
<i>- To any end.</i>

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:33.250
It can launch a nuclear strike
and then cover its own tracks,

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:35.868
pointing the finger
at whomever it wants to blame.

01:09:35.951 --> 01:09:40.169
<i>Whatever is run by a computer,
it can control.</i>

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.325
And we still don’t know
what they intend to use it for.

01:09:43.407 --> 01:09:44.658
<i>Yes.</i>

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.260
<i>But we can at least now confirm that
Alexander is indeed selling the Handle,</i>

01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:52.100
<i>with Greg Simmonds
brokering the deal for $10 billion.</i>

01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:53.901
Confirmed.

01:09:53.983 --> 01:09:55.673
<i>So, what now?</i>

01:09:55.755 --> 01:09:57.473
When’s the transaction
gonna take place?

01:09:57.555 --> 01:09:59.150
Deal’s set for 9:00 a.m.

01:09:59.932 --> 01:10:03.060
Between the newspaper and
info extracted from his phone,

01:10:03.393 --> 01:10:06.726
<i>Ben Harris was to be picked up
from Hotel Amara’s lobby</i>

01:10:06.808 --> 01:10:08.874
<i>by Alexander’s representative</i>

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:12.618
<i>and taken to the exchange
to transfer the escrow.</i>

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.270
He still needs to call Greg
to get a 15-digit passcode.

01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:19.932
So, inconveniently,
we do still need Ben Harris.

01:10:20.672 --> 01:10:22.940
Could’ve done
without him dying, but still.

01:10:23.022 --> 01:10:24.311
Childish.

01:10:24.393 --> 01:10:25.900
Can we make me Ben Harris?

01:10:26.825 --> 01:10:27.730
Go on.

01:10:27.943 --> 01:10:29.400
They don’t know what he looks like.

01:10:29.682 --> 01:10:32.225
<i>He guarded his visual identity
very closely.</i>

01:10:32.942 --> 01:10:34.540
<i>- Mr. Harris?</i>
- Yes.

01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:37.238
<i>There is a green
G-Wagon outside.</i>

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.980
<i>My men will escort you.</i>

01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:42.574
I’ll do the deal myself.

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:44.860
But you’ll have to talk
to Greg on the phone.

01:10:55.508 --> 01:10:57.660
It’s a pleasure to meet with you,
Mr. Harris.

01:10:58.049 --> 01:10:59.740
Your phone, please.

01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:04.001
Anything else?

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:05.981
Nothing else.

01:11:06.735 --> 01:11:08.838
- Do you mind?
- Please.

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:19.770
I can make you look like him,
but I can’t make you sound like him.

01:11:20.192 --> 01:11:21.600
Don’t we know
someone who can?

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:24.874
I’ll tell you what,
Danny, Michaela.

01:11:24.956 --> 01:11:26.115
It’s a gift.

01:11:26.197 --> 01:11:29.488
It is a gift. My dad had it.
It’s like a party trick for him.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:32.698
Didn’t matter what it was.
Could be a toy, could be a pair of shoes.

01:11:32.781 --> 01:11:34.464
He could put his hand on it,

01:11:34.844 --> 01:11:37.738
shut his eyes and tell you the price.
He’d go, “14.99.”

01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:39.448
No, he could.
He could. You--

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.368
Don’t stop on my account.
I have to use the little girls’ room.

01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:44.198
Yes, my darling.
You know where it is, don’t you?

01:11:44.907 --> 01:11:47.687
Yes. It’s...
straight past Mimar Sinan

01:11:47.769 --> 01:11:49.310
and a right at Timur.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:51.948
She’s funny, isn’t she?

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:53.715
- She’s great.
- You’re very lucky.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.018
Right. So, roof comes down.
Watch this.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.764
Roof comes down.

01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:02.560
You say, “Relax. Relax, Mr. Steak.”
There he is, all calm now.

01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:10.365
<i>Sarah, regrettably,
Ben Harris has passed away.</i>

01:12:10.447 --> 01:12:12.027
- When?
<i>- Couple of hours ago.</i>

01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:15.103
<i>Orson encouraged him to jump off
an extremely tall building.</i>

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:17.734
- Poor guy.
<i>- Can you make him sound like Harris?</i>

01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:19.948
Have you sourced any
existing voice recordings?

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:21.028
<i>Yes.</i>

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:24.078
<i>In which case, upload them and
send them to me, and I can do that.</i>

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.111
<i>How?</i>

01:12:25.205 --> 01:12:27.387
- The vocoder works in real time.
<i>- Clever.</i>

01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:29.618
- That’s AI for you, Nathan.
<i>- One last thing.</i>

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.440
<i>I need you to confirm you still have
full access to Alexander’s network.</i>

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:36.940
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.902
Make yourself comfortable.
There is water in the door.

01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:10.202
- So far, so good.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:13:10.284 --> 01:13:12.448
Keep in touch, JJ.

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:17.012
You two are gonna have to entertain yourselves
for an hour, ’cause I got to make a work call.

01:13:17.094 --> 01:13:20.204
It’s all right. I guess I could use
a little nappy-poo myself, so...

01:13:20.286 --> 01:13:22.854
- I’ll join you for your nappy-poo.
- Yeah?

01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.194
Change of plan.

01:13:24.276 --> 01:13:27.206
Danny, you make the work call.
I’ll take the nappy-poo.

01:13:27.288 --> 01:13:28.600
Michaela, you join me.

01:13:28.843 --> 01:13:29.996
Greggy.

01:13:36.029 --> 01:13:38.860
They’re going off road.
I’m parking up.

01:14:01.442 --> 01:14:05.060
He is the real deal.
It’s super impressive.

01:14:05.628 --> 01:14:07.667
- And he’s so into you!
<i>- You really know your stuff.</i>

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.354
I mean, if you’re not interested,
I know I might be.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.658
Fill your boots.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.920
<i>- Where’s the paradox?</i>
- What are you doing?

01:14:14.002 --> 01:14:16.755
Well, I need to make Orson
sound like Greg’s lawyer.

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:17.954
Why?

01:14:18.049 --> 01:14:21.166
Because Ben Harris is dead,
and we need him alive for the arms deal.

01:14:21.275 --> 01:14:23.788
Ben Harris is dead?
When did that happen?

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:26.112
- And who killed him?
- That’s not something you need to worry about.

01:14:26.194 --> 01:14:28.627
You need to worry about how much
longer we have until we’re found out.

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:30.115
Found out?

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:34.861
I know you’re having a billionaire
love affair. It’s very sweet.

01:14:34.943 --> 01:14:39.310
But we have about 20 minutes before
Greg’s security blows our fucking brains out.

01:14:41.507 --> 01:14:42.698
What do I do?

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.988
I suggest you get ready
for your next scene.

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:47.560
- Which is?
- The getaway.

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:50.031
Right. I know how to do that.

01:14:50.275 --> 01:14:52.260
- Action time.
- Right.

01:14:52.342 --> 01:14:55.190
- I’ll see you in the garage.
- Okay, darling.

01:15:15.455 --> 01:15:16.822
They will be here soon.

01:15:26.707 --> 01:15:27.730
I’m on.

01:16:06.073 --> 01:16:08.060
- Sergi.
- Boss.

01:16:11.799 --> 01:16:13.020
<i>I’m in place.</i>

01:16:14.128 --> 01:16:15.980
Mr. Harris, I assume.

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:19.900
Pleasure to meet you.

01:16:20.573 --> 01:16:21.640
Likewise.

01:16:26.808 --> 01:16:28.075
Here we are.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.788
<i>Your people have confirmed
our product is authentic.</i>

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.111
<i>I present the Handle.</i>

01:16:37.608 --> 01:16:39.002
I need my phone.

01:16:51.409 --> 01:16:52.940
Yes, Benjamin Bunny?

01:16:53.695 --> 01:16:57.577
- Mr. Simmonds, we’re connected.
<i>- Mr. Simmonds, we’re connected.</i>

01:16:58.724 --> 01:17:00.969
- All right.
- We’re good.

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:08.494
The 15-digit passcode.

01:17:10.442 --> 01:17:11.869
A moment of privacy, please.

01:17:11.951 --> 01:17:13.560
<i>A moment of privacy, please.</i>

01:17:13.848 --> 01:17:15.690
- Emilia.
- What is it?

01:17:16.786 --> 01:17:20.020
There seems to be some sort of
break-in in our Internet security.

01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:24.127
<i>- Just waiting for the system to go online.
- Just waiting for the system to go online.</i>

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.190
Holding.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.739
It’s like someone’s hacked in,
but it keeps dropping in and out.

01:17:30.821 --> 01:17:32.459
Who’s hacking in?

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:35.127
The signal’s coming
from within the compound.

01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:36.988
Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.999
<i>Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>

01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:40.815
Right, here we go.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:44.560
Two, six, two...

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.786
<i>Harris is
transferring now. Stand by.</i>

01:17:47.868 --> 01:17:49.068
Update.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.900
It’s happening.

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:54.500
Check the monitors.
Show me where.

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:56.738
The signal’s bouncing all around the server.
I can’t lock it down.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.360
<i>- ...squiggly dash, eight...</i>
- Come on.

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:02.520
<i>five, nine,</i>

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:04.650
small letter “b” for bollocks...

01:18:06.428 --> 01:18:09.230
<i>...five, six,</i>

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.440
<i>five, five, comma,</i>

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:15.860
big “C” for clit.

01:18:20.093 --> 01:18:21.118
It happened.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.060
<i>Ponytail, 11 o’clock.</i>

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:26.021
Show me Greg’s office.

01:18:26.104 --> 01:18:27.988
I know Greg’s in there.
Why is it empty?

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.560
- Got it?
<i>- All done.</i>

01:18:29.843 --> 01:18:31.738
- Transaction complete.
<i>- All right, Ben.</i>

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.315
You hurry home.
Don’t talk to strangers.

01:18:37.723 --> 01:18:41.488
Check all communications
in and out of the villa in the past 24 hours.

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:43.329
<i>Doesn’t like ya.</i>

01:18:43.411 --> 01:18:45.408
<i>It’s the guard from the villa.</i>

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:47.225
I’m on him.

01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:49.216
Payment confirmed.

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:54.469
Ten billion confirmed.

01:18:54.934 --> 01:18:56.020
Confirmed.

01:18:56.323 --> 01:18:57.642
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

01:18:57.794 --> 01:18:59.190
Confirmed.

01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:02.029
<i>Ponytail, lodging complaint.</i>

01:19:02.111 --> 01:19:04.520
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Harris.</i>
- Stop!

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.202
This is not Ben Harris.

01:19:09.607 --> 01:19:10.480
Kill him!

01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:12.560
JJ.

01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:40.026
<i>Sarah, update.</i>

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:42.190
I’m just unconfirming
their confirmation.

01:19:43.042 --> 01:19:45.010
- What’s happening?
- It was confirmed.

01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:46.060
Just confirm again!

01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:01.993
JJ, who are these people?

01:20:02.075 --> 01:20:03.369
<i>- I’m scanning.</i>
- Find out.

01:20:03.451 --> 01:20:06.190
Give me a moment.
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

01:20:06.395 --> 01:20:09.383
- I don’t understand.
- What don’t you understand?!

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.230
It’s gone.

01:20:25.042 --> 01:20:26.868
Just don’t tell me it’s Mike.

01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:28.882
<i>Understood.</i>

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:30.515
<i>Then I won’t.</i>

01:20:31.122 --> 01:20:33.230
- Who is it?
- I’m not allowed to tell ya.

01:20:33.928 --> 01:20:35.340
Fuck it!

01:20:36.209 --> 01:20:37.698
Give me a fucking break.

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.988
I got Orson under control.

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:40.449
Get that gun out of my face.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.315
Give me the fucking radio.

01:20:42.607 --> 01:20:44.360
Are you up there
in the chopper, Mike?

01:20:45.236 --> 01:20:47.060
Orson, you sound upset.

01:20:47.429 --> 01:20:50.288
Don’t you worry about me, Mike.
I’m having a lovely time.

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.980
What seems to be the problem?
Engine trouble?

01:20:53.286 --> 01:20:56.618
<i>Don’t concern yourself.
I’ll give you the bus fare home.</i>

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.480
My boys
will take over from here.

01:21:04.534 --> 01:21:05.659
Come on.

01:21:08.608 --> 01:21:09.809
Who are ya?

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:14.411
Who are you, Michaela?

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:18.520
How’d you do it?

01:21:20.482 --> 01:21:22.480
This thing between us...

01:21:24.066 --> 01:21:25.060
is strong, isn’t it?

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:27.900
<i>Do you know
what the Turks call it?</i>

01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:32.155
It means “fire.”

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:34.770
<i>They say the gods will
be furious if you put it out.</i>

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.078
<i>But you know
what I’m gonna do?</i>

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.770
I’m going to put it out,
Michaela, because of Danny.

01:21:40.975 --> 01:21:43.060
He’s a friend,
and I respect him.

01:21:43.322 --> 01:21:45.920
And it’s the right thing to do.

01:21:46.747 --> 01:21:48.310
I’m sorry
if that disappoints you.

01:21:49.563 --> 01:21:52.365
- No, it’s fine.
- I’ll see you at dinner.

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.779
Round up any survivors.

01:22:03.861 --> 01:22:06.135
Tie ’em up, beat ’em up,
bring ’em here.

01:22:06.217 --> 01:22:08.730
I wanna be back in the air ASAP.

01:22:11.495 --> 01:22:13.194
<i>Orson,
you know why I’m here.</i>

01:22:13.276 --> 01:22:15.961
Let’s not make this
any messier than it needs to be.

01:22:16.047 --> 01:22:17.449
So don’t be a bad girl.

01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:18.758
<i>Just surrender my prize.</i>

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.425
You want it so bad,

01:22:20.574 --> 01:22:23.443
you get your arse down here
and get it yourself.

01:22:24.755 --> 01:22:26.539
I have people
to do that for me.

01:22:26.621 --> 01:22:27.619
Oh, here he is.

01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:30.100
Keeping a safe distance
as usual.

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.154
You’re a spineless jellyfish,
Mike.

01:22:32.236 --> 01:22:34.988
- Yatom, get the case.
- I’m on it.

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:37.198
Go on. It’s yours.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.860
You’re not taking it.
I’m giving it to ya.

01:22:44.123 --> 01:22:46.688
Okay. What’s this?

01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:51.905
- Oh, no. He’s got a gun.
- It’s okay, relax. Relax.

01:22:53.421 --> 01:22:55.100
Oh, it’s a selfie! Okay!

01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:57.543
Who’s gonna tell me
what’s going on?

01:22:57.625 --> 01:22:59.288
We think they hacked
into our secure server.

01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:02.581
- It’s not that secure, then, is it?
- It’s worse than that, I’m afraid.

01:23:02.663 --> 01:23:06.054
Whoever you think you were on
the phone to before, you weren’t.

01:23:06.302 --> 01:23:08.229
<i>Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.</i>

01:23:08.311 --> 01:23:10.361
What are you on about?
That’s Ben.

01:23:10.443 --> 01:23:12.310
<i>Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.</i>

01:23:12.562 --> 01:23:15.529
You stop Danny Francesco
and whoever the fuck that is.

01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:17.020
Do it now.
Do it now!

01:23:17.176 --> 01:23:18.528
Get after that car.

01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:20.576
- Bring them back to me.
<i>- Understood.</i>

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:32.615
- Yatom, we good?
- Yes. We got it.

01:23:32.942 --> 01:23:34.650
Check the case, John.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.288
You have the case.
So why are we on our knees?

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:46.760
You won’t be on your knees
for long, my friend.

01:23:46.842 --> 01:23:47.872
Orson,

01:23:48.455 --> 01:23:50.980
there’s something
strange going on up here.

01:23:51.876 --> 01:23:54.230
- It’s good, boss.
- Right.

01:24:07.272 --> 01:24:08.650
Temperature’s changed.

01:24:08.954 --> 01:24:12.020
<i>Mike’s gone rogue.
He’s executed Alexander’s men.</i>

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.230
We’ve got what we need.
Connors.

01:24:16.686 --> 01:24:17.770
Yes, boss?

01:24:18.195 --> 01:24:19.360
Kill Orson.

01:24:21.727 --> 01:24:24.488
- They’re gonna kill you now.
- Shoot them first, then.

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:35.520
I’m not just good with dogs.

01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:40.900
Tidy.

01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:44.028
There’s a chopper
with a dead pilot up here.

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:46.118
<i>- I’ll meet you there.</i>
- Incoming.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.961
<i>- Nathan.</i>
- Yes?

01:24:48.043 --> 01:24:50.331
<i>Nathan, we’re being chased
by Greg’s security.</i>

01:24:50.413 --> 01:24:51.810
Then get un-chased.

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:56.780
Good news,
the back is bulletproof.

01:24:56.862 --> 01:24:58.980
Bad news,
I can’t control the back end.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.628
You any good in one of these?

01:25:08.728 --> 01:25:10.558
It’s been a while.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.455
But I’ll feel my way.

01:25:13.256 --> 01:25:14.980
It’s only a chopper.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.698
Feeling my way.

01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:32.036
You think you can
put your foot down?

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.829
What are you gonna do
with that?

01:25:39.911 --> 01:25:42.158
I’m gonna shoot at them, Danny.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.358
I think I can
help you out with that.

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:01.455
I’m out of bullets.

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:05.158
<i>- Nathan, are you there?</i>
- Yes, what is it?

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.113
Your friend Mike’s appeared again,
but this time he’s turned.

01:26:08.195 --> 01:26:09.118
<i>Turned?</i>

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.829
<i>He’s executed Alexander’s
men and taken the AI.</i>

01:26:11.911 --> 01:26:13.560
I’m going after him
in a chopper.

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:21.286
<i>Did the other two
get out okay?</i>

01:26:21.368 --> 01:26:23.650
Don’t worry about them.
They can take care of themselves.

01:26:26.308 --> 01:26:27.682
The road’s closed.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.238
<i>- What happened?
- Cover’s blown.</i>

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.266
Greg’s security
are in pursuit.

01:26:40.348 --> 01:26:42.360
You just focus on retrieving
the case from Mike.

01:26:42.668 --> 01:26:45.238
- Find out where they are.
- Already on it.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.600
Two minutes southwest
of this thing.

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:13.940
They’re going
in the tunnel.

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.619
Do you know how to use
these rocket launchers?

01:27:24.701 --> 01:27:26.150
Can’t be too complicated.

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:29.520
F for “forward,”
R for “rocket.”

01:27:30.841 --> 01:27:32.690
Oh, I think
we’re in trouble here.

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.367
I think R’s for “rear.”

01:27:47.449 --> 01:27:50.055
I think I’ve worked that out now.
Thank you, JJ.

01:27:50.796 --> 01:27:53.480
Let’s hope there’s
two more seats in that chopper.

01:28:01.562 --> 01:28:04.506
Knighton has confirmed Mike
was not working for any government.

01:28:04.588 --> 01:28:06.020
He’s been working
independently.

01:28:06.376 --> 01:28:07.906
Ain’t that a surprise.

01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:09.768
<i>You need to track him down.</i>

01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:12.866
You track him down.
We’re going back to Greg’s.

01:28:12.948 --> 01:28:14.328
- We are?
- You are?

01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.953
- We are?
- We are?

01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:18.142
I can’t go back to Greg’s.

01:28:18.358 --> 01:28:20.593
Danny, nothing to worry about.

01:28:20.675 --> 01:28:23.828
- JJ’s taking care of you.
- Sit down, Danny.

01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:26.867
You might wanna see Greg,
but I don’t think Greg wants to see you.

01:28:26.949 --> 01:28:30.532
That’s where you’re wrong, Nathan.
I am exactly who he wants to see.

01:28:30.615 --> 01:28:34.036
He knows Sarah downloaded enough
information on him to throw away the key.

01:28:34.118 --> 01:28:37.074
...find some evidence we can
hold over him for a rainy day.

01:28:37.156 --> 01:28:40.360
- So, Greg now works for us.
- Clever me. I’m just gonna say it.

01:28:40.442 --> 01:28:42.326
JJ, tell Greg we’re coming in.

01:28:42.408 --> 01:28:44.113
We have an offer
he can’t refuse.

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:46.081
We’ll be expecting a call.

01:28:46.163 --> 01:28:48.017
Whatever you say, boss.

01:28:48.597 --> 01:28:50.990
Can we--
can we drop me off first?

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.352
Nothing to worry about, Danny.
Greg’s in love with you.

01:28:54.434 --> 01:28:56.650
- Would you buckle up?
- Sit down, Danny.

01:29:29.923 --> 01:29:33.589
Well, if you’re wondering whether
I’m feeling something of a tit,

01:29:34.222 --> 01:29:36.368
the answer is yes, I am.

01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:39.158
- Is it humiliating, Emilia?
- Yes.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.633
Do we still think
we can maybe make a deal?

01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:43.118
Yes.
Yes, we do.

01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:45.028
Which is not to take away

01:29:45.111 --> 01:29:48.690
from the genius of your plan,
Orson Fortune.

01:29:49.396 --> 01:29:51.198
That is a sexy name.
It is.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.020
You must fancy him a bit,
fake Michaela.

01:29:56.128 --> 01:29:57.480
Still fancy you a bit.

01:29:58.990 --> 01:30:03.329
But what you done,
using him as bait,

01:30:03.411 --> 01:30:06.868
celebrity Trojan horse,
that’s brilliant. It’s classy.

01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:09.438
Not so classy, though,

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.360
is your competitor Mike.

01:30:11.777 --> 01:30:15.078
Comes barreling in,
pretending to be Mr. Law and Order,

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.556
steals your thunder
and, potentially,

01:30:18.638 --> 01:30:19.900
my commission.

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:23.940
You can keep
your commission, Gregory.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.328
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:30.895
You can keep your commission,
you can keep your reputation, your liberty.

01:30:31.177 --> 01:30:33.467
Because you’re gonna donate
your said commission

01:30:33.549 --> 01:30:35.900
to your favorite charity,
Orphans of War.

01:30:40.073 --> 01:30:41.190
Am I?

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:43.400
Who’s your buyer, Greg?

01:30:44.536 --> 01:30:46.570
I never reveal my buyers,
Orson.

01:30:48.986 --> 01:30:50.488
Emilia, tell them.

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.118
You remember
Trent and Arnold?

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.618
...would you care to meet
Trent and Arnold...

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.078
- The biotech billionaire friends.
-  That’s it.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.655
As we speak, they are using
your precious programmable AI,

01:31:03.737 --> 01:31:06.174
the Handle,
I believe you call it,

01:31:06.256 --> 01:31:08.618
in conjunction
with a concert of satellites.

01:31:09.514 --> 01:31:11.698
...enjoying the view
from up here.

01:31:11.781 --> 01:31:15.687
Purpose: To trip up
the world’s banking system.

01:31:15.769 --> 01:31:18.531
So that’s why they’re buying
up 40 billion dollars’ worth of gold

01:31:18.614 --> 01:31:21.564
while simultaneously trying
to cover their tracks.

01:31:21.647 --> 01:31:24.198
That’s exactly it, Orson.
By the time they finish,

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.288
gold is the only thing you’ll be
able to buy a sticky book with.

01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:29.120
You’re taking us there, Greg.

01:31:29.202 --> 01:31:30.549
I could.

01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:33.024
And I reckon
I can get through the door because

01:31:33.336 --> 01:31:35.293
I’ve got something
they can’t ignore.

01:31:35.375 --> 01:31:38.213
Namely, a comprehensive
insurance policy.

01:31:38.295 --> 01:31:41.213
But I do worry about
your invitation.

01:31:41.302 --> 01:31:43.206
Trent and Arnold
have rented themselves

01:31:43.288 --> 01:31:44.988
a very nasty
little private army.

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:47.100
You let me worry about that.

01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:49.690
Just one last thing.

01:31:52.602 --> 01:31:55.400
I would kill
to see you in action.

01:31:57.743 --> 01:31:58.942
Oh, Danny.

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.849
Well, how can I say no?

01:32:10.184 --> 01:32:11.217
So,

01:32:11.624 --> 01:32:13.908
what are they going to do
with this Handle?

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:15.190
The Handle...

01:32:16.402 --> 01:32:18.699
would be
a financial atomic bomb.

01:32:18.781 --> 01:32:22.065
<i>It’ll create a digital glitch
in the world’s banking system.</i>

01:32:22.153 --> 01:32:23.905
<i>May last only a few minutes,</i>

01:32:23.989 --> 01:32:28.028
<i>but that’ll be enough for trust to
evaporate in conventional markets.</i>

01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:29.247
Gold,

01:32:29.659 --> 01:32:31.007
like always,

01:32:31.862 --> 01:32:35.587
would be the only remaining
currency with any credibility,

01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:38.199
<i>its value rising exponentially.</i>

01:32:38.281 --> 01:32:40.131
Anarchy would follow...

01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:43.020
while the world
reorganizes itself.

01:32:44.069 --> 01:32:45.500
Well, Nathan,

01:32:46.088 --> 01:32:48.988
now it’s time for your man
to prove his worth.

01:32:53.028 --> 01:32:54.495
Clear the room.

01:32:55.975 --> 01:32:57.993
- Anita.
- Yes, Mr. Knighton.

01:32:58.122 --> 01:33:00.255
Get the PM on the line.

01:33:10.181 --> 01:33:13.815
And the bird is up.
We’ll have eyes soon.

01:33:17.042 --> 01:33:20.150
And Greg and Danny have arrived.

01:33:24.955 --> 01:33:26.142
Floor is yours.

01:33:26.595 --> 01:33:28.679
- Method?
- Blitzkrieg.

01:33:29.257 --> 01:33:31.279
Get ’em before they count the first body.

01:33:31.361 --> 01:33:32.757
I like it.

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:36.509
I’ll cover ya.
There are blind spots.

01:33:36.596 --> 01:33:38.828
That’s what the bird’s for, JJ.

01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:40.110
JJ...

01:33:41.386 --> 01:33:42.480
shoot straight.

01:33:48.317 --> 01:33:49.600
Leave it with me, boss.

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.442
How are you feeling?

01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:11.946
- Good.
- Nervous?

01:34:12.035 --> 01:34:13.448
No.

01:34:13.949 --> 01:34:16.650
Remember your lines.
You’ve only got two.

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.270
<i>You got the bit
about the lights?</i>

01:34:23.948 --> 01:34:25.049
Yes.

01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:27.475
One more thing, Danny.

01:34:28.482 --> 01:34:29.941
Lose the shades.

01:34:36.068 --> 01:34:38.390
And we are back

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:42.408
with four guards by the pagoda.
I am blocking their comms.

01:34:43.492 --> 01:34:44.440
Blocked.

01:34:45.776 --> 01:34:47.400
I have the two on the right.

01:34:58.775 --> 01:35:01.768
Hello, boys. Hello.

01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:05.687
A lot of very serious faces, Danny.

01:35:05.770 --> 01:35:08.198
Now, you remember those two,
don’t you? Trent and Arnold.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.238
And one of you,
you, is Mike. Is that right?

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.119
Well played, Mike.

01:35:14.201 --> 01:35:16.238
A bit naughty
for a government contractor,

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.158
<i>but we are where we are.</i>

01:35:18.241 --> 01:35:19.730
Moving on.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.360
Two more ahead.
I’ll take one o’clock.

01:35:30.402 --> 01:35:32.978
The purpose
of this visit is, Danny?

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:40.814
You never paid...
Mr. Simmonds’s commission.

01:35:40.896 --> 01:35:43.862
We were paying for you to deliver,
but you didn’t.

01:35:44.577 --> 01:35:46.969
Mike did. You failed.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.117
That’s a bit weak, isn’t it, Trent?
Because I wasn’t paid to deliver.

01:35:50.199 --> 01:35:53.238
I was paid to supply,
and I think I have supplied. Have I, Danny?

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.908
<i>Orson, take a left
through the hedges.</i>

01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:56.810
Two on the jetty.

01:35:59.934 --> 01:36:01.601
Now you’re clear.

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:09.512
Do we really
have to listen to this?

01:36:09.594 --> 01:36:12.146
You will listen to this,
and here’s the reason.

01:36:12.376 --> 01:36:15.959
I don’t wanna patronize you.
I’m not a patronizing person.

01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:18.750
But you three,
one, two, three,

01:36:18.832 --> 01:36:21.354
you are quite new
to this game, aren’t you?

01:36:21.436 --> 01:36:25.288
And there is a reason why no one,
and I do mean no one,

01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:28.028
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Qaddafi,

01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:29.528
not Mr. Escobar--

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:31.900
and that’s before
I start dropping names,

01:36:32.668 --> 01:36:35.788
why none of them
have ever refused to pay me.

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.868
<i>- Have you got me?</i>
- Going dark.

01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:39.489
Repositioning.
Let me find you.

01:36:39.571 --> 01:36:40.618
In the Can-Am.

01:36:41.847 --> 01:36:43.198
<i>Behind me,
on the horizon,</i>

01:36:43.281 --> 01:36:46.738
I think you’ll see an old,
derelict, 1960s hotel.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.908
<i>Needs demolition.
Now, you could do that with...</i>

01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:53.600
I don’t know, what, 30, 40 pounds of Semtex.
About right, Mike?

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.826
<i>Silence
and darkness retained.</i>

01:36:57.908 --> 01:36:59.860
And you’ve got
two more guards up top.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.988
Or you could do it with...
Lights, please, Danny.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.189
...one AGM-65 Maverick missile

01:37:09.271 --> 01:37:11.420
very much like this one

01:37:11.502 --> 01:37:13.709
in three, two, one.

01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:19.751
What happened there then?

01:37:20.048 --> 01:37:21.778
Let’s do that again.

01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:25.372
In three, two, one.

01:37:29.972 --> 01:37:32.600
Wait. Wait. Wait.
There’s more.

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.480
There we are.
I think we’re done now.

01:37:50.075 --> 01:37:52.301
Danny,
the lights again, please.

01:37:54.661 --> 01:37:57.582
What are you trying
to convey with this...

01:37:57.664 --> 01:37:59.310
illustration, Mr. Simmonds?

01:37:59.792 --> 01:38:04.047
What I’m trying to convey, Mike,
is how little you boys understand

01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.434
of the new world
which you find yourselves in.

01:38:07.516 --> 01:38:09.175
I would’ve thought
it was obvious

01:38:09.257 --> 01:38:11.111
that I’d have some kind
of insurance,

01:38:11.193 --> 01:38:13.190
and I do.
Danny, give them the papers.

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:19.602
You’ll see
in the left-hand column

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:21.987
there’s a list
of names and addresses

01:38:22.069 --> 01:38:24.618
of people that I believe
you hold near and dear.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.988
<i>Take the service elevator
one level down.</i>

01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:29.448
And he’s in. Phase two.
Let’s move.

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:31.055
In the right-hand column,

01:38:31.137 --> 01:38:35.116
there’s a very exact time for
when those people will be...

01:38:35.597 --> 01:38:37.270
What’s a nice word for it,
Danny?

01:38:38.949 --> 01:38:41.409
- “Eviscerated.”
- That’s not a very nice word, is it?

01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.328
<i>But it’s not gonna happen,</i>

01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:46.618
<i>because I’m very confident</i>

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.687
that within five minutes,

01:38:48.769 --> 01:38:52.181
and five minutes is all you have
as the countdown has started,

01:38:52.263 --> 01:38:54.096
and the only thing
that will stop it...

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:03.190
is a phone call
from my business manager...

01:39:05.176 --> 01:39:06.650
telling me
that my money

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.150
has been transferred
to my account.

01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:24.270
<i>So from this point,
it’s out of my hands and into yours.</i>

01:39:24.636 --> 01:39:25.867
Danny,

01:39:25.949 --> 01:39:28.035
let’s go and have a drink.
Come on.

01:39:30.744 --> 01:39:32.400
Bye, boys.

01:39:34.588 --> 01:39:35.937
I mean,
give him the money.

01:39:36.019 --> 01:39:38.832
Mike. That’s my mom there.

01:39:40.049 --> 01:39:40.980
Jean.

01:39:43.475 --> 01:39:45.829
That’s the most impressive thing
I’ve ever seen a man do.

01:39:45.911 --> 01:39:48.198
Really? Really?

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.788
Get the transfer done now.

01:39:49.872 --> 01:39:52.480
- We were set up to make the payment anyway.
- So get it done now!

01:40:00.074 --> 01:40:01.156
He’s bluffing.

01:40:01.238 --> 01:40:03.658
Those explosions didn’t
look like a bluff to me!

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:07.150
Turns out there’s a reason they call him
the Dark Angel of Merciless Death, Mike!

01:40:21.216 --> 01:40:23.868
<i>- Listen to me. He’s bluffing.
- Easy for you to say.</i>

01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:25.698
I mean, do you even have
anyone on your list?

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:28.907
You can forget your commission, Mike.
 It’s going to Simmonds.

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:32.369
You useless pair of Silicon tits.
Let me handle this.

01:40:32.451 --> 01:40:34.280
Back off! All right?

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:36.190
You handling it
put us in this mess.

01:40:36.666 --> 01:40:38.930
I’m not interested
in what you have to say, Mike.

01:40:39.013 --> 01:40:40.980
Now back the fuck off!

01:40:50.436 --> 01:40:51.440
Backing off.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.801
Backing off.

01:40:56.667 --> 01:40:59.039
Everybody calm down.
Calm down.

01:40:59.121 --> 01:41:00.702
Mike looks upset.

01:41:00.784 --> 01:41:02.658
- Orson, how you doing?
<i>- Still alive.</i>

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.448
- Still moving upwards.
<i>- Okay, well,</i>

01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:07.828
Greg left with the movie star. It seems
like things are getting a bit heated in there.

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:10.238
Chris, progress report.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.327
It’s happening, it’s happening.
30 seconds.

01:41:13.335 --> 01:41:14.961
They’re doing
the transferring now.

01:41:15.043 --> 01:41:17.128
That’s a billion dollars
to your Orphans of War.

01:41:17.210 --> 01:41:19.586
- Look, we’ll be okay.
- We won’t be okay.

01:41:19.668 --> 01:41:21.949
Did you see what happened out there?
You think that’s okay?

01:41:22.031 --> 01:41:26.078
I am in their system.
I have all their codes and details.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.988
I can move all their money.

01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:30.452
Truth is,
I am better than them,

01:41:30.747 --> 01:41:32.788
and you don’t need them anymore.

01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:34.755
...idea to get involved with
the fucking weapons dealers--

01:41:34.842 --> 01:41:36.128
Don’t turn this
around on me.

01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:37.884
We have a problem,
and we have to deal with it.

01:41:37.966 --> 01:41:40.181
- There are explosions going off on the--
- Oh, are there?

01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:42.593
- You think that’s fu--
- So, you’re just gonna brush that off?

01:41:42.675 --> 01:41:44.100
No, no. No. No!

01:41:59.115 --> 01:42:00.244
Is it safe to go in?

01:42:00.868 --> 01:42:03.770
It’s hard to tell,
but there is nobody moving.

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.560
Bit of a mess in here,
whiz kid.

01:42:28.106 --> 01:42:29.672
Found the case, JJ.

01:42:33.909 --> 01:42:35.100
Just check it.

01:42:38.859 --> 01:42:39.866
We’re good, boss.

01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:44.552
<i>Behind you.
In three, two, one.</i>

01:42:55.106 --> 01:42:56.560
Don’t do it, Mike.

01:42:57.296 --> 01:42:58.739
Leave it where it lies.

01:43:04.604 --> 01:43:07.191
Orson, I need the case.

01:43:07.273 --> 01:43:08.948
I need the fucking case!

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:11.113
You want it so bad, Mike,

01:43:11.195 --> 01:43:13.360
- you can fucking have it.
- Orson!

01:43:36.337 --> 01:43:38.956
- What you got in the case?
- Our wages.

01:43:39.357 --> 01:43:41.891
Is that Nathan and his army
to get us out of here?

01:43:41.973 --> 01:43:44.024
That’s not Nathan you can hear.

01:43:44.113 --> 01:43:48.448
That’s Knighton’s black ops incoming,
a little bit late as usual.

01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:51.698
Nathan abandoned us. Apparently,
he has something more important to do.

01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.288
- Of course he did.
- He sent the BBJ.

01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:57.698
He’s in Doha. Apparently,
there’s been another incident.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.812
Oh, but he told me
to tell you not to panic.

01:43:59.894 --> 01:44:02.480
He has all of your medicinal
requirements on board.

01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:04.943
Did you bring a corkscrew?

01:44:05.025 --> 01:44:06.658
I’ll be your corkscrew, baby.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.925
Course you will.

01:44:08.013 --> 01:44:10.310
Budge up.
We’re going on a holiday.

01:44:44.331 --> 01:44:46.940
I suppose you’re all feeling
quite pleased with yourselves.

01:44:47.265 --> 01:44:50.698
It’s impossible to feel pleased with
ourselves on the wages you pay.

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.236
I have some good news.

01:44:52.318 --> 01:44:54.939
Since your last escapade
was such a success,

01:44:55.245 --> 01:44:56.900
don’t let it go to your heads,

01:44:57.214 --> 01:44:58.701
I have another job for you.

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:01.788
And this time,
the money is spectacular.

01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:04.383
I don’t care
how spectacular it is.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:06.472
I’m going on holiday.
That’s yours.

01:45:06.554 --> 01:45:08.429
Ooh, where are we going,
darling?

01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:10.429
Don’t know,
and I don’t care.

01:45:10.511 --> 01:45:13.363
As long as it’s
hot, expensive, and he’s paying.

01:45:13.558 --> 01:45:15.695
- And we’re taking the jet.
- Take it, take it.

01:45:15.777 --> 01:45:17.559
Go wherever you want. Go mad.

01:45:17.642 --> 01:45:19.466
Enjoy the snow,
enjoy the beaches.

01:45:19.548 --> 01:45:22.151
It’s all on me, as long
as you’re back in 36 hours.

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:24.731
- Two weeks.
- Orson.

01:45:25.359 --> 01:45:26.944
- I’m not great at skiing.
- Orson.

01:45:27.026 --> 01:45:28.114
I like the beach.

01:45:28.196 --> 01:45:29.931
I don’t care where we go
as long as I’m drunk.

01:45:30.013 --> 01:45:32.488
- Fine. 48 hours.
- Ten days.

01:45:32.571 --> 01:45:35.421
- You’re killing me! Ninety-six hours!
- A week.

01:45:35.504 --> 01:45:39.991
And, Orson, we need the necklaces
and watches you stole from Alexander.

01:45:40.073 --> 01:45:42.288
Your government
wants them back.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.753
Too late. I’ve sold ’em.
I’ve invested the money.

01:45:45.835 --> 01:45:48.869
We are now in the movie business.

01:45:49.501 --> 01:45:51.114
See you next Tuesday.

01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:53.028
Hold on.

01:45:54.198 --> 01:45:55.305
Orson.

01:45:55.387 --> 01:45:57.619
Wait. W-What movie business?

01:45:57.701 --> 01:46:01.308
It better not involve Danny Francesco
and his fiancé, Greg Simmonds.

01:46:30.034 --> 01:46:32.752
We were paying to deliver,
but you didn’t.

01:46:32.834 --> 01:46:34.887
Mike did. You failed.

01:46:36.242 --> 01:46:38.401
Yeah, well, that’s
a bit naughty, Mr. Yamamoto.

01:46:38.484 --> 01:46:41.150
I’m not paid to deliver.
I’m paid to supply.

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:45.785
Now, there’s a very
good reason why no one,

01:46:45.867 --> 01:46:47.552
and I mean no one,

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:50.918
not Mr. Hussein, not Mr. Qaddafi,
not Mr. Escobar--

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.252
and that’s before
I start dropping names...

01:46:53.334 --> 01:46:55.619
Behind me on the horizon,

01:46:55.701 --> 01:46:59.601
there’s a derelict monastery
in need of demolition.

01:47:00.701 --> 01:47:02.452
Now, how are we going
to do that?

01:47:02.534 --> 01:47:06.653
Well, we could use 50, 60 pounds of Semtex.

01:47:06.735 --> 01:47:08.718
Does that sound about right,
Mr. Yamamoto?

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:15.132
Or we could use one single
AMG-65 Maverick missile,

01:47:15.214 --> 01:47:17.578
very much like this.

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:20.959
Going in three, two, one.

01:47:23.934 --> 01:47:26.486
Fucking amateur hour. Maxie.

01:47:26.568 --> 01:47:28.374
- Where’s the VFX, Maxie?
- Sorry, Danny.

01:47:28.457 --> 01:47:30.818
- Come on, man. I can’t work like this.
- I’ll get it fixed.

01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:33.078
- Barney, can you get me Guy?
- Cut the camera.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:34.861
Cut the cameras.
Reset, everybody.

01:47:37.334 --> 01:47:39.685
What did you think
of that one, Greggy?

01:47:39.767 --> 01:47:41.552
I’ll be honest with you.

01:47:41.634 --> 01:47:44.517
For me,
that was very, very moving.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.226
That was--
That was beautiful, Danny.

01:47:47.309 --> 01:47:48.985
- That one?
- That one.

01:47:49.067 --> 01:47:50.725
- That one.
- That one.

01:47:50.807 --> 01:47:53.378
I don’t know.
It was not my best take. I don’t--

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.160
Did you like that one?
I don’t--

01:47:55.317 --> 01:47:58.168
See, I love that bit because
you’re-- you’re smiling,

01:47:58.251 --> 01:47:59.685
but you’re scary too.

01:47:59.767 --> 01:48:02.524
Yeah. But look at my hair.
It’s awful.

01:48:03.313 --> 01:48:06.270
- I just feel like it’s--
- There. And there, there.

01:48:07.495 --> 01:48:09.106
- Brilliant.
- I think we can do another one.

01:48:09.188 --> 01:48:10.900
- We can do another one. Guy!
- Go on. Off you go.
