29:23.680 --> 29:25.125
An orphan. Yeah, well, look,

29:25.200 --> 29:27.123
if the date's right, Duncan would be over 70.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.884
You thinking what I'm thinking, Fe?

29:28.960 --> 29:31.008
<i>That Duncan stole Peckham's identity?</i>

29:31.080 --> 29:34.926
The archivist told me
that Duncan got to the archives by car.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.486
So just find me an Andrew Peckham

29:37.560 --> 29:39.722
somewhere within old-man driving range.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.363
It's good to have you here, Scott.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.280
Do you need anything?

29:46.360 --> 29:47.964
Yeah, one thing.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.326
I signed my confidentiality agreement, okay?

29:51.640 --> 29:54.644
- You guys can trust me.
- Okay.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.848
Cosima had me looking at stem cell growth kinetics

29:56.920 --> 29:59.685
but I wanted to see if Dyad tagged them
like they tagged the clones.

29:59.760 --> 30:00.841
So, I ran PCR.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.081
And...

30:03.360 --> 30:04.566
They're not clone cells.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.210
They're from a totally different person.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.567
So I checked for familial markers.

30:09.880 --> 30:13.089
The clones share 13 STR loci

30:13.760 --> 30:15.091
with the stem cell donor.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.602
Whoever you cloned, do they have a female relative?

30:17.680 --> 30:20.206
Like a niece or even a daughter?

30:22.960 --> 30:26.203
Scott, you cannot tell Cosima about this.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.523
- Uh...
- Not... Not one word!

30:29.040 --> 30:31.441
Do you understand me?

30:37.120 --> 30:38.565
Victor! (CLEARS THROAT)

30:41.240 --> 30:43.686
- Hey, you want to come for a smoke?
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.524
It's not one of my vices.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.364
Well, I'm kicking mine one at a time.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.766
Good.

30:52.360 --> 30:57.446
Well, I have to make these
place settings for Family Day. just...

30:57.520 --> 30:58.646
<i>okay-</i>

30:59.280 --> 31:01.009
I could use some help, if you...

31:03.880 --> 31:05.564
Okay, sure.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.051
Two good hands between us, right?

31:07.480 --> 31:08.606
Yeah.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.326
See you up there?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.731
Yes, thank you.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.486
<i>- Namaste.
- No, don't do that.</i>

31:14.560 --> 31:15.766
- Okay.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.001
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:38.000 --> 31:39.331
How's recovery going, Vic?

31:40.600 --> 31:42.489
We're going to make doilies together.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.369
- I'm impressed.
- Yea h?

31:44.440 --> 31:45.771
That makes one of us.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.605
Hey, no second thoughts, we have a deal.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.042
I'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix

31:55.120 --> 31:56.849
but my charges go away and I'm done.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.090
No, I mean it, I'm done.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.642
This shit's cramping my recovery.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.086
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

32:46.160 --> 32:47.889
Should have known you'd show up.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.764
With shit on your shoe, no doubt.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.360
You bitch, you knew all along.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.364
My whole life, you knew.
You're just one of them, aren't you?

32:56.440 --> 32:58.488
I am not one of them.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.721
Just like you, I got caught up
in a struggle I didn't ask for.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.642
Only I've been at it longer, so I'm better at it than you.

33:04.720 --> 33:07.246
I didn't come here for your shit, Siobhan!

33:07.360 --> 33:08.361
Where's Duncan?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.602
- Is he here?
- His name is Peckham.

33:10.974 --> 33:12.575
It has been ever since he came over to our side,

33:12.600 --> 33:13.647
20 years ago.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.850
We hid him in exchange for information about...

33:18.120 --> 33:21.567
experiments on unborn children

33:21.640 --> 33:23.369
and a surrogate who ran away.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.765
- Amelia.
- Yes.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.886
Carlton found you in the foster
system and... (INHALES)

33:29.960 --> 33:32.088
Dyad have been after us ever since.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.329
- I don't believe a word you say.
- (SCOFFS)

33:36.760 --> 33:39.366
The question is who do you trust?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.722
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

33:45.880 --> 33:47.211
After you.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.286

33:56.960 --> 33:59.201
Come on, Rosalyn. Good girl. Come on.

34:02.680 --> 34:05.331
Andrew, I've got someone who wants to meet you.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.481
Mmm?

34:08.199 --> 34:09.201
Here.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.766
(WATER RUNNING)

34:16.040 --> 34:17.610
You're...

34:18.960 --> 34:20.121
Sarah Manning.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.481
- Not Rachel?
- She's the one I told you about.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.891
Remember?

34:25.960 --> 34:27.405
Amelia's child.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.525
Sorry, forgive me.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.728
Yeah, it's not what I'm here for.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.007
Can I, um, get you both some tea?

34:44.080 --> 34:45.650
Oh, you've done it.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.565
We need to get moving, unfortunately.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.282
The birds can't feed themselves.
Rosalyn...

34:51.440 --> 34:54.045
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.167
I always do.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.005
Five minutes.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.240
I'm not sure where to start.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.163
I don't know how many there are.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.127
We weren't the only implantation team.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.680
Project LEDA, what are we for?

35:14.760 --> 35:17.331
Proof of concept, how everything starts.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.928
The military recruited Susan and I

35:21.000 --> 35:24.288
in...1974? '75?

35:24.360 --> 35:26.203
- '76.
- Hmm.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.725
Susan was the brains, really.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.088
Did you know that she cracked the spindle protein problem?

35:32.640 --> 35:35.007
What did you do?

35:35.080 --> 35:36.366
We succeeded.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.205
Cloned human embryos.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.211
What a feat!

35:41.480 --> 35:45.610
But an oversight committee declared us an ethical failure.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.930
Um, are you sure you won't have some tea?

35:49.560 --> 35:51.801
- How is Dyad involved?
- Contractor.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.691
When the military scuppered our work,

35:54.760 --> 35:58.287
Dyad persuaded us
to push on to full-term.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.287
So Dyad hijacked Project LEDA?

36:01.360 --> 36:04.409
Once you've gone too far, it's hard not to go all the way.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.728
Why? What did you want?

36:10.680 --> 36:11.920
Babies.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.365
Little girls.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.410
You know we're not just a concept, right?

36:33.720 --> 36:35.370
That we're your consequences!

36:35.440 --> 36:36.646
Have you met Rachel?

36:36.920 --> 36:39.048
- My Rachel?
- Yes, I have.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.365
What a treat.
You've really created a monster there.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.325
We didn't. We loved her.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.809
Now, please, I want to see her.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.171
What makes you think I'd do that for you?

37:14.480 --> 37:15.686
Hello, Paul.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.407
Sarah's in there with Duncan?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.570
Oh, yes. Tea?

37:24.920 --> 37:27.321
It's just tea, Paul.
Just a conversation.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.883
And what would I talk about with you?

37:30.080 --> 37:31.889
Well, your next move, of course.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.731
I've got biscuits in my pocket.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.967
No, thanks.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.966
Who sent you?

37:39.320 --> 37:41.891
- Dyad.
- Hardly an answer, Dyad's a hydra.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.969
(CLICKS TONGUE)
For God's sake.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.690
If Sarah's got between Leekie and Rachel,

37:51.760 --> 37:53.205
I bet you are, too.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.921
And a man with two masters answers only to himself.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.765
Who does Siobhan Sadler answer to?

38:00.520 --> 38:01.646
I'm the mum, aren't I?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.606
If you think you're taking Sarah back,

38:06.680 --> 38:07.966
you'll have to kill me.

38:08.367 --> 38:10.034
And if you think you're going to take Duncan back,

38:10.040 --> 38:11.724
the only man alive

38:11.800 --> 38:14.690
who can give Sarah and her sisters what they need,

38:14.920 --> 38:16.968
then you'll have to kill us both.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.204
But you don't want to do that.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.450
Or Afghanistan would all have been for nought.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.764
What would you know about that?

38:27.840 --> 38:30.810
Paul, in your position,

38:31.880 --> 38:34.201
you could really use a new friend.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.845
Was it ever real, your little family?
Or was it just an experiment?

38:39.920 --> 38:42.810
- It was both.
- So was Daddy Rachel's first monitor?

38:43.040 --> 38:46.044
- Of course, but...
- Do you know what Dyad's done to her?

38:46.120 --> 38:48.168
- What she's become?
- That wasn't us.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.930
It wasn't even Dyad.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.484
It was the Neolutionists inside Dyad.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.801
Dr Leekie.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.284
- I don't have to talk to you.
- Yes,

38:59.400 --> 39:00.890
you do, and you know it!

39:01.000 --> 39:02.047
It's all in the past.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.521
No, it's not! This is my life!

39:05.120 --> 39:07.600
And you gave it to me, so you're going to help us!

39:07.880 --> 39:09.211
- No.
- Yes, you are!

39:09.320 --> 39:12.005
I'll take you to Leekie, you can talk to him, then.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.526
(WEEPING)

39:16.560 --> 39:18.688

39:35.400 --> 39:36.686
I can't!

We're real, Ethan.

Cosima is

39:44.120 --> 39:46.441
unlike anybody I've ever met.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.243
And she's sick.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.008
We're sick.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.725
Your little girls are dying.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.449
It could happen to Rachel, too.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.923
I tried to stop it.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.884
You can help us now.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.247
You don't understand.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.250
What don't I understand?

40:15.080 --> 40:18.562
Leekie... Leekie wouldn't let us
raise her.

40:19.920 --> 40:24.482
We were going to expose everything but he found out and...

40:27.120 --> 40:29.691
Go on, you can tell her.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.410
Who do you think I've been hiding from all these years?

40:38.400 --> 40:41.961
Aldous Leekie killed my Susan!

40:44.360 --> 40:47.569
He killed Rachel's mother!

40:51.240 --> 40:53.527
ALISON: <i>My neighbour Aynsley
always thought she was better than me.</i>

40:53.600 --> 40:56.285
- You have to learn to forgive...
- Then I killed her.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.725
Do you smell salt?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.761
- Oh.
- Aw!

41:00.440 --> 41:01.726
I may have spiked his tea.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.047
They're onto me.
The computer's been hacked,

41:04.120 --> 41:06.726
which means they could have
my location. I'm on the move.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.881
What have we there?

41:07.960 --> 41:10.531
Everything, Mrs Sadler.
Absolutely everything.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.329

41:12.400 --> 41:15.400
I have something you want.
