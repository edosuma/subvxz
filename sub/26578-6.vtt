00:01.694 --> 00:03.492
<i>During the day, my parents were fine</i>

00:03.517 --> 00:05.879
<i>with us kids wandering
the streets like feral cats.</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:07.999
<i>It was the '70s,
and there were a lot of us.</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.039
<i>But at night, they couldn't sleep</i>

00:10.040 --> 00:12.079
<i>until all of us were home,</i>

00:12.080 --> 00:14.539
<i>in absolutely no danger of
being out having any fun.</i>

00:42.620 --> 00:44.079
Eddie. You, me, Confession.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.169
- Let's go.
- I'm good.

00:46.170 --> 00:49.499
No. You're not.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.619
I'll go to Confession with you.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.250
Have you done anything wrong?

00:53.732 --> 00:55.181
No.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.370
Then how about we don't waste
Father Dunne's time.

00:59.670 --> 01:01.169
Mercy! Ow, ow.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.828
See, that rough-housing
and your father's income

01:04.830 --> 01:06.329
is why we can't have nice things.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.879
Oh, Mrs. Strausser.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.669
Uh, listen, I gave Mike your petition

01:09.670 --> 01:11.079
about the new Persians
in the neighborhood,

01:11.080 --> 01:12.119
but I don't know
if he's looked at it yet.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.999
Well, I'm not here about that.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.669
But I'm going to Bakersfield for a week,

01:15.670 --> 01:17.879
and I wondered if the boys
could do a little yard work.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.782
<i>Working for Mrs. Strausser was sweet.</i>

01:19.807 --> 01:22.079
Mrs. Strausser's here. Ka-ching!

01:22.080 --> 01:23.619
<i>Joey took his cut and then subcontracted</i>

01:23.620 --> 01:25.249
<i>the actual work to me and William...</i>

01:25.250 --> 01:26.579
<i>everyone getting their beaks wet.</i>

01:26.580 --> 01:28.919
Hello, Mrs. Strausser.
Always such a pleasure.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.459
- Hello, Eddie.
- Joey.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.289
- Joey. Sorry.
- Oh, gosh, don't be.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.789
Hardly matters which one they are.

01:33.790 --> 01:35.919
Mrs. Strausser's going away
for a week...

01:35.920 --> 01:39.079
I know the drill. A little yard work...
raking, watering,

01:39.080 --> 01:40.709
pull the occasional
dead squirrel from the birdbath.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.539
And no more bringing them home
to make into puppets.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.919
I thought that was gonna be
a better idea than it was.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.079
Now, was that $5 or $6 last time?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.289
I believe you insisted on $10.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.959
That won't be necessary, ma'am.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.289
Where'd you come from? Always lurking.

01:53.290 --> 01:56.789
- I'd be happy to do it for free.
- What the...

01:56.790 --> 01:58.039
I think neighbors should be neighborly,

01:58.040 --> 01:59.789
and a good deed is its own reward.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.169
He spreads it on a little thick,

02:01.170 --> 02:02.749
but he's saving you 10 bucks.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.919
That's very kind of you, Frank.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.829
Thank you, ma'am.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.378
Oh, and was that petition

02:08.380 --> 02:10.163
Persian people or Persian cats?

02:10.187 --> 02:11.688
It might make a difference to Mike.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.329
Hey, d-bag,

02:15.330 --> 02:17.379
thanks for screwing me over
on the Strausser job.

02:17.380 --> 02:18.875
I'm being a decent human being.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.149
You should try it sometime.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.999
Uh, pass-adena.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.879
What's really going on here?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.709
I don't see the upside
of doing free yard work

02:25.710 --> 02:27.379
for some dumb, old lady.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.789
Eileen Strausser has a degree

02:28.790 --> 02:30.919
in Library Science from
Cal State Fullerton.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.079
We should all be so dumb.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.580
It's very upsetting you know all that.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.079
She makes a nice sun tea.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.620
We talk.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.879
You notice how I ease down when I stop?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.669
It's less wear on the brake shoes...

02:47.670 --> 02:49.539
instead of stomping on them like an ape

02:49.540 --> 02:51.119
the way you kids do.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.227
I see.

02:52.266 --> 02:54.389
- I'll definitely try to...
- I was your age once, too, you know.

02:54.414 --> 02:56.789
Also interested in the company of girls.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.619
It's a normal, built-in thing.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.119
Hmm. But 3:00 a.m.?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.789
- Dad, Wendi and I haven't...
- I don't want to know.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.119
That nonsense is between

03:04.120 --> 03:07.419
you and Father Dunne
in the confessional.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.959
It's the value I get
for my donation plate dollar.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.209
Talk it through with a priest...

03:12.210 --> 03:13.879
like you would any other sin.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.619
Just like you'd have
to confess it if, say,

03:15.620 --> 03:18.079
you stole or you murdered
or you, I don't know,

03:18.080 --> 03:20.669
walked into Parson's Pharmacy today,

03:20.670 --> 03:23.039
bought a pack of condoms.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.249
All those things...
stealing, murder, rubbers...

03:26.250 --> 03:27.919
all mortal sins,

03:27.920 --> 03:31.119
equally condemned by me and by God.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.709
They keep them behind the counter,

03:32.710 --> 03:35.119
so you have to ask the guy.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.879
But it's wrong.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.329
Can't emphasize that enough.

03:40.330 --> 03:42.114
Wrong and behind the counter.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.709
Bottom line...
you get in the confessional

03:48.710 --> 03:50.119
and you spill your guts.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.459
Clean slate.

03:51.460 --> 03:52.829
That's why Jesus died...

03:52.830 --> 03:55.039
so the Catholics get do-overs.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.919
How about that?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.579
Parson's Pharmacy is just a block away.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.709
Huh.

04:05.146 --> 04:06.475
Look here.

04:06.578 --> 04:09.086
Marmaduke dragged spaghetti
all over the house,

04:09.114 --> 04:10.613
once again affirming my decision

04:10.614 --> 04:12.273
that we do not want a dog.

04:12.274 --> 04:13.403
Did you make a note of what time

04:13.404 --> 04:14.782
our son got home last night?

04:14.807 --> 04:16.659
I have eight sons.

04:16.694 --> 04:17.983
It's so real when I say it.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.403
Eddie, the one with a girlfriend.

04:19.404 --> 04:20.942
No one cares how late Pat stays out

04:20.944 --> 04:21.983
trying to make friends with that possum.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.313
We need to clamp down on Eddie.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.903
I dealt with him on that.

04:24.904 --> 04:26.193
You dealt with him?

04:26.194 --> 04:27.403
Yeah. I know what time he came home.

04:27.404 --> 04:29.023
We talked. It's been handled.

04:29.024 --> 04:30.273
<i>My father had been very pleased</i>

04:30.274 --> 04:31.813
<i>with his delicate handling of Eddie.</i>

04:31.814 --> 04:33.903
<i>But he knew if my mom found out
what he told Eddie,</i>

04:33.904 --> 04:35.903
<i>she would not share his enthusiasm.</i>

04:35.904 --> 04:37.313
You're sure you said enough?

04:37.314 --> 04:40.153
I said the exact right number of words.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.233
You're gonna have to give me

04:41.234 --> 04:42.773
some latitude on this one, Peg.

04:42.774 --> 04:43.903
It's not the kind of thing

04:43.904 --> 04:45.193
where a boy wants to include his mom.

04:45.194 --> 04:48.233
Guys, come on! I'm coming up!

04:50.024 --> 04:51.363
Pat! Get down from there!

04:51.364 --> 04:52.573
You're gonna break your neck!

04:52.574 --> 04:55.072
You'll get a wheelchair for Christmas
instead of a Big Wheel.

04:55.097 --> 04:56.546
I'm getting a Big Wheel?

04:56.571 --> 04:58.411
No! Now get down!

04:59.995 --> 05:01.589
Let the boy climb a tree, Peg.

05:01.614 --> 05:04.273
- He'll fall.
- And survive and learn something.

05:04.274 --> 05:06.233
- That's how it works with boys and trees.
- Oh.

05:06.234 --> 05:08.613
One falls out of the other
and everybody ends up fine.

05:08.614 --> 05:09.693
Is that what you said to Eddie, too?

05:09.694 --> 05:11.073
It's okay if he falls off Wendi?

05:11.074 --> 05:12.443
I gave him enough facts

05:12.444 --> 05:14.073
so he could work things out for himself.

05:14.074 --> 05:16.273
You trust Eddie to work things out?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.613
He's the most like Marmaduke
of all our sons.

05:18.614 --> 05:20.813
Why read the comics if you're
not gonna learn from them?

05:20.814 --> 05:22.364
It's better than babying them
like you do.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.102
- Oh.
- This crazy new fad

05:24.126 --> 05:25.741
of supervising your kids?

05:25.774 --> 05:26.943
I want these boys leaving this house,

05:26.944 --> 05:28.573
standing on their own two feet,

05:28.574 --> 05:31.113
in their own two shoes
that I won't have to pay for.

05:31.114 --> 05:32.813
I saw this "ABC After School Special"

05:32.814 --> 05:34.193
on ABC after school one day,

05:34.194 --> 05:35.653
and this handsome, young couple

05:35.654 --> 05:37.693
had to give up their dream
of being an ice dancing team

05:37.694 --> 05:40.233
because she was skating for two.

05:40.234 --> 05:42.773
That won't happen,
not with Eddie's weak ankles.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.273
He can't skate worth crap.

05:44.274 --> 05:46.693
They ended up in a trailer park in Iowa!

05:46.694 --> 05:48.113
Now, what did you say to Eddie?

05:48.114 --> 05:50.363
I said enough, Peg.

05:50.364 --> 05:52.023
Now leave it alone.

05:52.024 --> 05:53.273
It's been handled.

05:53.274 --> 05:55.073
<i>My dad laid down the law.</i>

05:55.074 --> 05:56.443
<i>He made it very clear he didn't want her</i>

05:56.444 --> 05:57.693
<i>discussing this topic with Eddie...</i>

05:59.574 --> 06:01.983
<i>...but he didn't say anything
about Eddie's girlfriend.</i>

06:01.984 --> 06:04.073
Wendi.

06:04.074 --> 06:05.733
How nice to see you.

06:05.734 --> 06:07.233
Come on in.

06:11.944 --> 06:13.443
Why's he doing this?

06:13.444 --> 06:15.443
It's like a billion degrees out there.

06:15.444 --> 06:17.023
Who's he trying to impress?

06:17.024 --> 06:18.863
Mom was there when he took the job.

06:18.864 --> 06:20.313
Maybe Frank's sucking up to Mom.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.903
- What does that get him?
- Love.

06:21.904 --> 06:23.573
Pfft. That's dumb.

06:23.574 --> 06:25.483
Mom has to love us no matter what.

06:25.484 --> 06:27.483
Dad, too. We've got them over a barrel.

06:27.484 --> 06:30.193
Maybe it's because of
Father Dunne's sermon on Sunday.

06:30.194 --> 06:32.273
No idea. I was busy playing pew-footsie

06:32.274 --> 06:33.943
with Kathy Petrillo.

06:33.944 --> 06:35.903
It was about how God is impressed

06:35.904 --> 06:37.613
by selfless acts of kindness.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.773
Maybe Frank is doing a pure, good deed.

06:40.774 --> 06:42.573
Not buying it. He's got an angle.

06:42.574 --> 06:45.273
- But Father Dunne said...
- Dunne probably has an angle, too.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.943
Either way, you guys
should be freaking out.

06:46.944 --> 06:49.863
Uh, what if this whole
working-for-free scam catches on?

06:49.864 --> 06:51.863
Everybody helping everybody.

06:51.864 --> 06:53.007
What kind of a world is that?

06:53.032 --> 06:54.573
- A utopia?
- Exactly!

06:54.574 --> 06:56.573
It screws up things for all of us.

06:56.574 --> 06:57.943
Timmy, how would you like it

06:57.944 --> 06:59.363
if Frank put on free puppet shows?

06:59.364 --> 07:02.313
He doesn't have the imagination
or the dexterity.

07:02.314 --> 07:05.193
But parents are cheap,
so if he doesn't charge,

07:05.194 --> 07:06.612
there goes the money
for your tap dance lessons.

07:06.637 --> 07:09.073
- I need those!
- You think Frank cares?

07:09.074 --> 07:11.198
He's not a friend of musical theater.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.273
And what about you?

07:12.274 --> 07:14.023
What if one of those
stupid books you like comes out

07:14.024 --> 07:14.984
and you can't afford to buy it?

07:14.985 --> 07:16.523
The library is free.

07:16.524 --> 07:18.363
The library is disgusting.

07:18.364 --> 07:20.193
It's where books go to get boogered.

07:20.194 --> 07:21.813
I try to pretend those are insects.

07:21.814 --> 07:23.733
We need our neighborhood chore money.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.233
And the bottom will fall out
of that economy

07:25.234 --> 07:26.613
if we don't stop Frank.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.813
So who's with me?

07:27.814 --> 07:28.983
- I'm in!
- Me, too!

07:28.984 --> 07:31.153
I like the enthusiasm.

07:31.154 --> 07:32.984
I might have a couple
of side projects for you.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.233
Another date with Wendi?

07:36.234 --> 07:37.573
Her folks are out of town.

07:37.574 --> 07:39.023
We've got the place to ourselves.

07:39.024 --> 07:40.363
Pretty sure I'm gonna get lucky.

07:40.364 --> 07:42.233
"Lucky"? Wow.

07:42.234 --> 07:43.773
It's not the most enlightened attitude.

07:43.774 --> 07:44.813
This is a girl you care about, man,

07:44.814 --> 07:46.363
not a blackjack table.

07:46.364 --> 07:49.363
I meant I just feel lucky
to be dating her.

07:49.364 --> 07:50.573
You were talking about sex.

07:50.574 --> 07:52.733
Whoa! Nice talk, seminarian.

07:52.734 --> 07:55.113
- You take Communion with that mouth?
- It's a new day, man.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.573
You know, we need to start being
more open about sexuality.

07:57.574 --> 07:59.653
Now you just made the word longer.

07:59.654 --> 08:02.193
Have you even consulted Wendi
about your plans for tonight?

08:02.194 --> 08:03.863
No. We don't talk about that stuff.

08:03.864 --> 08:05.903
- She's a nice girl.
- That's old thinking, man.

08:05.904 --> 08:07.653
You don't want to be all uptight
like Mom and Dad.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.363
You keep it real with Wendi,

08:09.364 --> 08:11.023
it's gonna make your connection
that much deeper

08:11.024 --> 08:12.863
- when the two of you...
- Please don't say it.

08:12.864 --> 08:15.113
I was just gonna say "make love."

08:15.114 --> 08:18.023
Ugh, that's the worst one of all.

08:18.024 --> 08:20.733
And now I add the flavor packet.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.023
Of course, you won't have
to learn all this, college girl.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.863
You'll have fancy maids sprinkling

08:24.864 --> 08:26.233
your flavor packets for you.

08:26.234 --> 08:28.113
Well, I am hoping to have a career.

08:28.114 --> 08:30.193
Don't let anything derail that, dear.

08:30.194 --> 08:31.943
Hate to see you make a shameful mistake

08:31.944 --> 08:33.903
and end up in some trailer park in Iowa.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.732
What? Why am I in Iowa?

08:35.734 --> 08:38.238
Exactly what Pamela Sue Martin
said in "Dancing On Thin Ice."

08:38.263 --> 08:39.403
Who on Earth

08:39.404 --> 08:41.193
would be calling me right now?

08:46.074 --> 08:47.153
Uh, Wendi.

08:47.154 --> 08:49.813
Uh, Eddie and I were
just talking about you.

08:49.814 --> 08:51.023
I mean, nothing in particular,

08:51.024 --> 08:54.701
just... life in all its wonders.

08:54.774 --> 08:55.944
Put 'er there.

08:58.984 --> 09:00.153
Uh...

09:00.154 --> 09:01.273
Cleary residence.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.523
Mrs. Cleary, Bob Parson.
Parson's Pharmacy.

09:03.524 --> 09:04.573
Oh, hello, Bob.

09:04.574 --> 09:05.813
I just thought you might be interested

09:05.814 --> 09:07.773
that... your son Eddie came in today.

09:07.774 --> 09:10.153
And he purchased...

09:10.154 --> 09:13.233
Really? I see.

09:13.234 --> 09:15.813
He bought Binaca, too,
so connect those dots.

09:15.814 --> 09:17.693
Uh, plus a Mars bar...

09:17.694 --> 09:19.193
I'm not sure yet how that factors in.

09:19.194 --> 09:20.863
I'll take it from here. Thank you.

09:22.444 --> 09:26.733
So... what do you and Eddie
have planned for tonight?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.113
Uh, nothing special.

09:28.114 --> 09:29.233
Well, that's ideal

09:29.234 --> 09:31.443
'cause I've suddenly got
an extra $9 ticket

09:31.444 --> 09:32.983
to the church fashion show.

09:32.984 --> 09:34.653
It's for spina bifida. Should be fun.

09:34.654 --> 09:35.654
Oh, you're here.

09:35.654 --> 09:36.654
Yeah. Hey.

09:36.655 --> 09:39.023
We've just been having
gobs of fun without ya.

09:39.024 --> 09:41.113
It's like, "Who needs Eddie?" Not us.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.573
I'm so glad you brought this one home.

09:42.574 --> 09:43.943
She's like the daughter I always wanted

09:43.944 --> 09:46.313
who made it to full term.

09:46.314 --> 09:49.273
So, what exactly did you have
planned for her tonight?

09:49.274 --> 09:50.773
Bowling?

09:50.774 --> 09:53.073
Bowling? That's dumb.

09:53.074 --> 09:55.153
We're going to the fashion show instead.

09:55.271 --> 09:57.314
That's awfully minty breath for bowling.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.308
<i>Was Frank really working
so hard for Mrs. Strausser</i>

10:03.355 --> 10:04.933
<i>just to be a good person?</i>

10:04.964 --> 10:06.810
<i>His only reward some small talk</i>

10:06.811 --> 10:09.089
<i>while sipping sun tea
with a retired librarian?</i>

10:09.136 --> 10:10.640
<i>Who's to say?</i>

10:10.665 --> 10:12.249
Not in a pile.

10:12.274 --> 10:13.353
Kick 'em around.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.060
<i>The possibility so offended Joey</i>

10:15.061 --> 10:16.767
<i>that he decided to sabotage him.</i>

10:16.792 --> 10:18.140
Where's William?

10:18.141 --> 10:19.510
I don't think he's coming.

10:19.511 --> 10:22.272
Pat, you've been promoted
to spreading dog poo.

10:22.297 --> 10:25.100
Yay!

10:25.493 --> 10:27.890
You got all of this from dogs?

10:27.891 --> 10:29.850
Mostly.

10:30.441 --> 10:32.850
<i>♪ She's a lady ♪</i>

10:32.918 --> 10:34.516
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

10:34.590 --> 10:36.097
<i>♪ She's a lady ♪</i>

10:36.141 --> 10:38.140
That pantsuit is so chic.

10:38.141 --> 10:39.470
She looks like the Charlie girl.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.720
I'm not so sure about these hemlines.

10:41.721 --> 10:45.140
Why buy the cow if the cow
is dressed like a strumpet?

10:45.141 --> 10:47.220
It's fun, if the girl feels confident.

10:47.221 --> 10:48.390
She'd have to feel confident

10:48.391 --> 10:50.220
that she's wearing clean underpants.

10:50.221 --> 10:51.890
And those platform shoes...

10:51.891 --> 10:53.510
I enjoy being as tall as Eddie.

10:53.511 --> 10:56.180
But teetering around
on crazy circus shoes

10:56.181 --> 10:58.560
seems unnecessarily risky
for young girls.

10:58.561 --> 11:01.180
Almost as risky as having
pre-marital relations.

11:01.181 --> 11:02.970
Well, now that you've got us
talking about that...

11:02.971 --> 11:04.601
are you fornicating with my Eddie?

11:06.221 --> 11:10.100
Wow. Uh, I was really enjoying
talking about shoes.

11:10.101 --> 11:12.560
Mrs. Cleary, uh, Eddie and I

11:12.561 --> 11:16.390
have never done any of that
and we have no plans to.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.810
You may not have plans to,
honey, but he does.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.810
Intimate relations is
this irrational drive with men.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.390
They use it to feel less alone,

11:23.391 --> 11:24.640
and so they can pretend to be part

11:24.641 --> 11:26.180
of this whole creating-life thing,

11:26.181 --> 11:27.390
which we basically do without them.

11:27.391 --> 11:30.270
I like that poncho.
I'd wear that. Mm-hmm.

11:30.271 --> 11:35.060
I think "intimate relations"
can be a drive for women, too.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.180
Not a drive I plan to do anything about

11:37.181 --> 11:38.850
until I'm in a committed relationship.

11:38.851 --> 11:40.600
You mean the Sacrament of Marriage.

11:40.601 --> 11:42.810
Anything less is just trying
to pull a fast one on Jesus.

11:42.811 --> 11:44.600
Plus, you don't get the tax benefits.

11:44.601 --> 11:46.600
But I don't like this notion
that all men

11:46.601 --> 11:48.350
are just trying to get something,

11:48.351 --> 11:50.180
and it's our job to resist.

11:50.181 --> 11:51.680
That's how it's always been.

11:51.681 --> 11:53.600
Men like making the first move.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.350
Women should also feel comfortable

12:10.351 --> 12:11.770
asking for what they want.

12:11.771 --> 12:13.220
After marriage.

12:13.221 --> 12:15.850
That's certainly a very 1970s idea.

12:15.851 --> 12:18.930
Well, it is the 1970s.

12:18.931 --> 12:20.010
I suppose.

12:20.011 --> 12:21.270
Things are changing.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.180
That's good for women like us.

12:23.181 --> 12:28.430
I guess I could be more open to change.

12:30.891 --> 12:32.010
I'm home.

12:32.011 --> 12:34.850
Hey.

12:34.851 --> 12:36.220
What's going on?

12:36.221 --> 12:37.720
Watching Johnny.

12:37.721 --> 12:40.140
Really funny "Carnac" tonight.

12:40.141 --> 12:41.850
"You are correct, sir!"

12:44.601 --> 12:46.325
I was thinking maybe we should...

12:46.372 --> 12:48.796
- <i>...Don Rickles.</i>
- ...go to bed early.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.350
Oh, you go ahead. Rickles is coming up,

12:50.351 --> 12:52.680
and then, uh, Sammy Davis Jr. after.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.560
So, you know.

12:54.561 --> 12:56.510
Mm.

13:27.351 --> 13:29.430
Guys, I saw Frank heading over
to Strausser's place.

13:29.431 --> 13:30.810
When he sees what we did last night,

13:30.811 --> 13:32.430
he's gonna drop a load.

13:32.431 --> 13:34.470
I might need a new grocery bag.

13:34.471 --> 13:38.010
I even threw some poo
over the fence into our yard.

13:38.011 --> 13:40.060
You really don't get this, do you?

13:40.061 --> 13:41.640
I don't, but I love it!

13:41.641 --> 13:43.431
You guys are my best friends!

13:45.141 --> 13:46.560
Did you wash your hands?

13:50.511 --> 13:52.270
We ran out of bacon,

13:52.271 --> 13:54.390
so I dipped some jerky in syrup.

13:54.391 --> 13:55.930
I think I invented a thing.

13:55.931 --> 13:59.220
Hey, uh... about last night.

13:59.221 --> 14:02.810
You know, you wanting to...

14:02.811 --> 14:05.060
- Are you complaining?
- No.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.810
Uh, heck no.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.680
I-I... It's just new.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.510
We usually don't do "new."

14:11.511 --> 14:13.640
Well, you like your new maple jerky,

14:13.641 --> 14:14.771
don't ya?

14:16.891 --> 14:18.470
It's a little scary.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.600
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

14:27.601 --> 14:29.680
I'm sorry about last night...

14:29.681 --> 14:31.310
me going off with your mom.

14:31.311 --> 14:33.560
I don't know. Maybe it was for the best.

14:33.561 --> 14:35.180
I was talking about you and me
with Lawrence...

14:35.181 --> 14:37.100
What about "you and me"?

14:37.101 --> 14:39.010
I had been cooking up
all these plans in my head

14:39.011 --> 14:44.310
about you and me having,
you know, s-e-x,

14:44.311 --> 14:46.560
<i>but it hadn't even occurred
to me to talk to you.</i>

14:46.561 --> 14:49.010
Well, if you keep spelling out
the naughty words,

14:49.011 --> 14:51.220
it might be a very long talk.

14:51.221 --> 14:55.060
I guess I'm just curious
what in particular

14:55.061 --> 14:56.680
aroused your interest.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.640
Is it because I asked
about your day earlier?

14:58.641 --> 15:01.890
Because I could do that more often.

15:01.891 --> 15:04.680
Just been thinking about how
things are changing for women.

15:04.681 --> 15:07.220
And some of it's good...
running marathons

15:07.221 --> 15:09.600
and having our own brand of cigarettes.

15:09.601 --> 15:11.930
- Hmm.
- But it was also something Wendi said.

15:11.931 --> 15:13.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

15:13.311 --> 15:14.560
you're talking to Eddie's girlfriend

15:14.561 --> 15:16.786
about our s-e-x activities?

15:16.817 --> 15:19.350
Wendi is a very smart,
modern young woman.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.889
If she's smart,
what's she doing with Eddie?

15:22.971 --> 15:24.180
Hmm.

15:24.181 --> 15:26.350
Maybe me messing up like this

15:26.351 --> 15:28.140
is an indication
that we just aren't ready yet.

15:28.165 --> 15:31.756
Maybe. Or... maybe not.

15:32.811 --> 15:34.390
What do you mean?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.060
<i>I was also thinking we weren't ready.</i>

15:36.061 --> 15:38.640
I was waiting to feel respected...

15:38.641 --> 15:40.470
waiting for you to grow up,

15:40.471 --> 15:42.310
<i>which now that we've
talked it through a bit,</i>

15:42.311 --> 15:43.680
maybe you have.

15:43.681 --> 15:44.681
<i>Oh, I've definitely grown up.</i>

15:44.682 --> 15:45.770
I've grown up so much,

15:45.771 --> 15:47.180
I already hate all the music

15:47.181 --> 15:49.317
these kids are listening to these days.
It's just noise.

15:52.391 --> 15:54.430
There he is.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.163
It's happening. It's happening!

15:57.061 --> 15:58.390
What the...

15:58.391 --> 16:00.180
Oh, here come the waterworks!

16:00.181 --> 16:01.721
I almost feel bad for him.

16:04.601 --> 16:06.890
Wait. What's he doing?

16:06.891 --> 16:08.680
He's just going back to work.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.890
But where's the tears?

16:10.891 --> 16:12.430
Where's the rage?!

16:12.431 --> 16:14.850
It's like when the Whos
down in Whoville still sang

16:14.851 --> 16:16.270
even though they didn't get presents.

16:16.271 --> 16:17.770
Well, I'm not done yet.

16:17.771 --> 16:19.181
Wait for it...

16:20.771 --> 16:22.140
Whoa!

16:23.681 --> 16:25.181
Bull's-eye!

16:26.721 --> 16:28.720
William?!

16:28.721 --> 16:30.270

16:30.271 --> 16:31.970

16:31.971 --> 16:33.390

18:15.561 --> 18:17.220
- Nice!
- Keep 'em coming.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.430
- You got it, boss!
- Ah.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.600
Take cover!

18:19.601 --> 18:20.930
Nice!

18:20.931 --> 18:22.180
Clean up those lemons, Frank!

18:22.181 --> 18:23.220
Take that, Frank!

18:23.221 --> 18:25.010
- Good shot!
- Eat it!

18:25.011 --> 18:26.970
Cut it out, Joey! I see you!

18:26.971 --> 18:28.970
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Ohh!

18:28.971 --> 18:30.010
- Nice!
- Nailed it!

18:30.011 --> 18:32.060
Alright, that tears it!

18:34.641 --> 18:37.720
Oh, no! She bought that during
a sabbatical in Santa Fe!

18:37.721 --> 18:40.010
Why do you know these things?!

18:40.011 --> 18:42.060
You guys are all dead!

18:42.061 --> 18:43.916
He's coming. Crap!

18:43.941 --> 18:45.311
Let's get out of here!

18:51.101 --> 18:52.600
I wasn't talking to Wendi about us.

18:52.601 --> 18:53.935
It was about things
she's doing with Eddie.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.441
Damn it! I told you that
Eddie business was handled.

18:56.466 --> 18:57.941
Why couldn't you keep
your nose out of it?

18:57.966 --> 18:59.060
Because it wasn't handled.

18:59.061 --> 19:01.060
Did you know he bought rubbers?

19:01.061 --> 19:04.310
Yes. I gave him some information
in that area,

19:04.311 --> 19:05.510
but I sent him to Confession after,

19:05.511 --> 19:07.100
so it's like it never happened.

19:07.101 --> 19:08.470
Great, now Father Dunne
will know I failed

19:08.471 --> 19:09.930
and stink-eye me from the altar.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.560
Like it or not, he's a teenage boy.

19:11.561 --> 19:13.180
We have to let him
work stuff out for himself.

19:13.181 --> 19:14.850
Teenage boys are idiots, Mike,

19:14.851 --> 19:16.310
and Eddie's not even cream of that crop.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.250
Help!

19:23.209 --> 19:25.350
Alright, Pat. You're okay.

19:25.351 --> 19:27.560
- I'll catch you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:27.561 --> 19:29.310
What happened to letting them
work things out for themselves?

19:29.311 --> 19:30.613
- That doesn't apply to this.
- Sure.

19:30.638 --> 19:31.746
I "gave him the information"

19:31.771 --> 19:33.090
not to climb up there, remember?

19:33.115 --> 19:34.510
Now, according to your thinking,

19:34.511 --> 19:36.270
- let things play out.
- This is different.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.350
Eddie's 18. He can handle more.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.640
- But Eddie's consequences are worse.
- Are you kidding?!

19:40.641 --> 19:42.854
From that height, Pat could
break his legs or even die.

19:42.879 --> 19:44.060
I could die?!

19:44.061 --> 19:45.470
Mind your own business! Adults talking.

19:45.471 --> 19:47.430
Honey, you're a great mom,

19:47.431 --> 19:48.799
and you want to protect your kids...

19:48.824 --> 19:50.244
I'm slipping!

19:50.269 --> 19:51.430
What did I say?

19:51.431 --> 19:54.140
...but it has to be case-by-case.

19:54.141 --> 19:55.930
Sometimes, maybe we do weigh in,

19:55.931 --> 19:57.680
and sometimes, we have
to let these idiots

19:57.681 --> 19:59.510
make the dumb decisions
they're going to make

19:59.511 --> 20:01.482
and just hope for Divine providence.

20:04.181 --> 20:05.938
Okay.

20:06.061 --> 20:07.399
That makes sense.

20:07.471 --> 20:08.547
What?

20:08.601 --> 20:10.310
Really?

20:10.311 --> 20:11.510
You mean I won one?

20:11.961 --> 20:14.227
- You convinced me.
- Wow.

20:14.311 --> 20:17.446
With this and last night,
you're full of surprises.

20:19.221 --> 20:20.600
What did I tell you
about going up there?

20:20.601 --> 20:22.100
- Sorry.
- You could've broken your neck,

20:22.101 --> 20:23.482
and then how would you
walk around Disneyland?

20:23.507 --> 20:24.926
We're going to Disneyland?!

20:24.951 --> 20:26.694
No.

20:31.156 --> 20:32.945
What was all that crying
and yelling about earlier?

20:32.970 --> 20:35.383
Oh, the kids were whipping
snakes at each other.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.705
Again?

20:36.706 --> 20:39.825
Where do they keep getting...
Never mind.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.535
Snakes weren't poisonous, I don't think,

20:41.536 --> 20:44.455
so I stayed out of it.

20:44.456 --> 20:47.876
Like I said, Peg, you're a great mom.

20:49.956 --> 20:51.915
<i>Can Scope handle your bad breath?</i>

20:51.916 --> 20:53.915
<i>Watch out, honey. Morning breath.</i>

20:53.916 --> 20:54.916
<i>Try my Scope!</i>

20:56.286 --> 20:58.585
<i>Mmm. Minty.</i>

21:00.746 --> 21:02.375
<i>Scope mouthwash tackles
morning breath...</i>

21:02.376 --> 21:04.455
<i>the worst breath of the day.</i>

21:04.456 --> 21:05.707
- You wanna turn in?
- Sure.
