Funniest thing--

Stella fell in love
with this dog on our walk,

00:06.590 --> 00:08.070
just stared at it lovingly.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.260
Turned out to be
her reflection in a hubcap.

Can you blame her?

with the dog?

Don't let it bother you, girl.

00:16.940 --> 00:17.870
Jay, we need to talk.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.750
I went to an allergist today,

00:19.830 --> 00:22.250
and he thinks that Joe's rash
is an allergy.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.650
What a surprise--
an allergist found an allergy.

He thinks he might be
allergic to Stella.

00:27.270 --> 00:27.990
What?

The only reaction this dog
gives people is the giggles.

her own face...

This allergy thing
is very serious.

We need to separate them
for a week

that long without seeing Joe.

Don't change the subject!

this week than last.

14:59.410 --> 15:00.490
What's going on?

15:00.630 --> 15:02.400
We have to get rid of Stella.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.710
Slow down.
We haven't decided anything yet.

15:04.810 --> 15:07.050
Yes, we have.
It's what's best for Joe.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.530
And for whatever it's worth,
my eyes have stopped itching,

15:09.630 --> 15:11.540
I can taste my food,
and I have more energy.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.600
You took a three-hour nap
yesterday.

15:13.730 --> 15:14.990
I was tired from the marathon.

15:15.070 --> 15:16.540
The "Downton Abbey" marathon?

15:16.610 --> 15:17.880
That family is exhausting.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.840
I can't believe this.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.260
Ah, Jay, I'm so sorry.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.060
Maybe you can get a fish!

15:22.140 --> 15:23.600
'Cause it's so much cuter
driving down the road

15:23.670 --> 15:25.380
with your fish's head
sticking out the window.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.810
Fish!

15:32.510 --> 15:33.610
Oh, my God.

15:33.740 --> 15:35.110
Are you here
for another lecture?

15:35.210 --> 15:36.980
Because you made your point
loud and clear.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.310
I'm keeping it casual.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.170
I haven't even looked
at Stella this morning.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.280
Okay, do not read
too much into that--

15:44.370 --> 15:46.090
I just took that off
one of Lily's teddy bears.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.060
It's fine.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.290
I'm glad you guys
are spoiling her,

15:48.380 --> 15:50.150
because I won't
be able to anymore.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.830
Joe's allergic.

15:52.060 --> 15:52.970
No.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.780
Yeah, and I figured since
she likes you so much,

15:55.910 --> 15:57.850
maybe you guys could keep her.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.080
Well, I mean, if that's
what's best for everyone.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.500
Maybe you better
check with Mitch first?

16:02.650 --> 16:03.520
He'll deal.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.530
I made her a steak.

16:04.650 --> 16:05.450
Okay.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.100
- And this is her daybed.
- Oh.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.570
I guess I better say goodbye.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.190
Hi, sweetie.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.660
I want to talk to you.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.170
Now, honey,

16:15.430 --> 16:17.340
you're gonna live here
from now on.

16:18.390 --> 16:20.070
Don't give me that look.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.960
It wasn't anything you did.

16:23.490 --> 16:25.700
You've been the best dog
I could ever have asked for,

16:25.820 --> 16:27.840
and I love you very much.

16:27.930 --> 16:29.060
So...

16:29.210 --> 16:30.490
stay away from cars...

16:31.470 --> 16:33.170
don't eat anything pointy...

16:35.140 --> 16:36.590
and be a good girl.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.700
Goodbye,
Stella-Bella.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.740
Wow.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.040
I didn't think I'd get
through that without crying.

16:46.150 --> 16:47.360
[ Voice breaking ]
Me neither.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.910
[ Sniffles ]

16:51.100 --> 16:53.020
Hey, dad, check out this video.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.550
It's a teacup pig
playing a piano.

16:55.630 --> 16:57.880
[ Laughing ] I saw that.
Andy sent it to me.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.170
Unbelievable.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.050
That's what I thought, but then
Andy and I did some digging.

17:01.130 --> 17:02.710
It turns out
pigs are crazy musical.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.440
[ Chuckles ]
Good ol' Andy.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.950
Is something up, buddy?

17:08.069 --> 17:09.369
[ Sighs ]

17:09.460 --> 17:10.810
I said "No" one time.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.390
And suddenly it's all
"Andy this" and "Andy that."

17:13.540 --> 17:14.829
Well, I didn't
mean anything by it.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.460
It just seemed like you needed
some space, so I gave it to you.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.369
I get it.

17:18.450 --> 17:19.970
You're at that age
when you want to separate.

17:20.069 --> 17:22.550
Yeah, I separate from you,

17:22.660 --> 17:24.010
not the other way around.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.329
Maybe I don't want to do dumb
stuff with you all the time,

17:26.450 --> 17:28.960
but... [Sighs]

17:29.610 --> 17:32.740
That doesn't mean
you get to replace me.

17:33.090 --> 17:34.280
What?

17:35.330 --> 17:37.700
Are you kidding me?
I could never replace you.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.850
If it were up to me,
we'd do everything together.

17:40.020 --> 17:40.690
Really?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.190
Yeah, I'd go
to college with you.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.640
We'd-- we'd be roommates.
We'd try to join a frat.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.220
None of them would take us.
We'd start our own.

17:46.290 --> 17:47.870
Oh, my God.
That sounds amazing.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.070
Why wouldn't they take us?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.430
Well, yeah, they'd take me,
but I'd be like,

17:50.520 --> 17:53.080
"No way, Bradley, not without
my little pal, here."

17:53.170 --> 17:54.970
I have mixed feelings
about that, dad.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.640
Do you have mixed feelings
about a hug?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.130
[ Scoffs ] Yes.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.610
Well, I need one, so I guess
I'm gonna go hug Andy.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.980
Hey, Judy,
that was a hilarious e-mail.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.190
Pickles <i> are</i> better than men.

18:12.270 --> 18:14.240
[ Laughter ]
Did you get that? It was so--

18:14.350 --> 18:16.070
Have you done any work
since you came here?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.230
I'm working the room.

18:17.310 --> 18:18.640
Ah, there he is.
Sport Coat.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.370
[ Laughing ]
Sport Coat?

18:21.770 --> 18:23.320
I can't believe these idiots
think you're funny.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.230
Okay. You know,
I have a theory

18:25.330 --> 18:26.980
why people here don't like you.

18:27.070 --> 18:28.440
[ Sighs ] I know why
they don't like me.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.190
It's 'cause dad makes me do
all his dirty work.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.270
Look at this list of people
I'm supposed to reprimand today.

18:33.350 --> 18:34.580
Let's see here. Um...

18:34.680 --> 18:36.810
Well, he does have a point--
Glen does smell.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.310
I'm gonna start
with Lucy--

18:38.410 --> 18:41.630
Lucy, the last person
who likes me.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.770
Mitchell:
Oh, it's okay.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.190
Um, hey, Luce.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.530
Hey, Claire. I got you one
of those cookies that you like.

18:47.610 --> 18:49.240
Oh, don't make this harder
than it has to be.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.860
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.910
It's not easy
for me to discuss, but, um--

18:53.000 --> 18:55.190
Um, Claire, I got this.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.000
It's my complaint.
I got it.

18:57.180 --> 18:58.700
- Um, Lucy...
- Mm-hmm.

18:58.810 --> 19:01.770
...you're at work,
so please dress like it.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.430
These "tops" that you wear
are completely inappropriate.

Wow.
Sorry to offend you.

You know what? Um...

19:08.790 --> 19:11.840
while I'm at it,
uh, Glen, shower more often.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.670
Chuck,
stop using "Reply all."

A-and, Doris, no one cares about
what you dreamt about last night.

a place of business, folks,

a little bit in there,
