WEBVTT

00:09.555 --> 00:11.791
Aw, damn it.

00:13.559 --> 00:15.361
You're you.

00:15.395 --> 00:17.863
I was having the
most amazing dream

00:17.897 --> 00:20.533
where you were you,

00:20.566 --> 00:22.735
but also you were Janis Joplin.

00:22.768 --> 00:25.705
But now you're just you.

00:25.738 --> 00:28.541
You're sexually attracted
to Janis Joplin?

00:29.909 --> 00:31.244
I don't know.

00:31.277 --> 00:33.246
That is kind of concerning.

00:33.279 --> 00:37.049
Anyway, you, Janis and me,

00:37.083 --> 00:39.919
and my year four teacher,
Mr. Freer, were on a road trip.

00:39.952 --> 00:42.255
Nope. What?

00:42.288 --> 00:44.224
No dreams. No, that's
for other people.

00:44.257 --> 00:46.426
My dreams are amazing.

00:47.627 --> 00:49.195
Fine, then you're
not allowed to talk

00:49.229 --> 00:51.631
about random dogs you see.

00:51.664 --> 00:55.268
But what if he's a little cowboy
wearing a bandana?

00:56.402 --> 00:59.805
Right. I am gonna go
hop in the shower,

00:59.839 --> 01:02.408
and then...

01:02.442 --> 01:04.043
it's Bloody Mary time.

01:04.075 --> 01:06.212
It's Sunday.
Why are you showering?

01:06.246 --> 01:08.814
Oh, still having weird
feelings about Janis Joplin.

01:08.848 --> 01:12.084
Figured I'd go sort
them out in there.

01:12.118 --> 01:14.887
Hey, so, um...
you know last night,

01:14.920 --> 01:17.457
when you were
crying in your car...

01:17.490 --> 01:18.724
All good now, right?

01:18.758 --> 01:20.059
Yeah, totally. I'm fine.

01:20.092 --> 01:21.827
Okay, good.

01:21.861 --> 01:23.129
Right, then.

01:23.163 --> 01:25.165
Hakuna matata.

01:25.198 --> 01:27.833
Did you just quote
The Lion King to me?

01:27.867 --> 01:29.068
The lion what?

01:29.101 --> 01:31.837
No, it's a...
it's a Swahili phrase.

01:31.871 --> 01:33.906
No, I know th...

01:33.939 --> 01:35.908
Are you sure
you're not quoting something?

01:35.941 --> 01:39.579
Just Khalid, the kabob shop
owner in my old neighborhood.

01:39.612 --> 01:42.248
I mean, the phrase doesn't
translate easily to English,

01:42.282 --> 01:44.116
but it means...

01:44.150 --> 01:47.353
that there is
not currently a problem.

01:47.387 --> 01:50.590
So would you say it's a...

01:50.623 --> 01:53.759
problem-free philosophy?

01:53.793 --> 01:55.428
That's a tad simplistic, but...

01:55.461 --> 01:59.599
Okay, so it's like no worries
for the rest of your days?

01:59.632 --> 02:01.834
Oh, Gretchen, Gretchen.

02:01.867 --> 02:04.437
The East Africans live
very much in the moment,

02:04.470 --> 02:07.973
so it's not a guarantee
of smooth sailing forever.

02:08.007 --> 02:09.342
That's just childish.

02:09.375 --> 02:10.710
But you know what?

02:10.743 --> 02:13.112
If you'd like to be
really positive about it, sure.

02:13.145 --> 02:16.482
Hakuna matata,
for the rest of your days.

02:46.246 --> 02:47.547
Oh!

02:47.580 --> 02:49.815
Hey. You must be Gretchen.

02:49.849 --> 02:51.150
I'm Edgar's friend, Dorothy.

02:51.183 --> 02:52.485
You know what I was realizing?

02:52.518 --> 02:54.487
We both have really
old-timey names.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.697
Isn't that hilarious? It's like,

03:02.562 --> 03:03.763
Ah, I know you.

03:03.796 --> 03:05.598
Oh, you do? Yeah.

03:05.631 --> 03:06.732
You're a theater girl.

03:11.036 --> 03:12.905
Morning.

03:12.938 --> 03:14.407
Have you met Dorothy?

03:14.440 --> 03:16.175
Oh, yeah, I already
made up a song.

03:22.214 --> 03:23.683
Yeah, Janis was a no-go.

03:23.716 --> 03:26.352
Pivoted to Grace Slick
at the last second,

03:26.386 --> 03:28.521
so it wasn't a total waste.

03:28.554 --> 03:30.556
Hi, Jimmy.

03:31.557 --> 03:34.294
Jimmy, this is Dorothy.

03:34.327 --> 03:35.461
R-Remember?

03:35.495 --> 03:37.563
From Hey, Put That Down Brian?

03:37.597 --> 03:39.465
Oh, yes!

03:39.499 --> 03:41.133
Dorothy, of course!

03:41.166 --> 03:43.869
Dorothy. Lovely to see you.

03:43.903 --> 03:45.405
Remember, I was the one
that suggested

03:45.438 --> 03:47.540
pet cemetery
for that incest scene?

03:47.573 --> 03:49.342
Of course.

03:50.743 --> 03:53.546
Yes, we've been
hanging out lately,

03:53.579 --> 03:56.148
so... that's why she's here.

03:56.181 --> 03:58.050
Great. So...

03:58.083 --> 04:00.152
Oh, right. Uh, yes.

04:00.185 --> 04:02.087
And...

04:02.121 --> 04:04.390
I'm sorry, I haven't
had time to go shopping.

04:04.424 --> 04:06.559
Ugh, I'm starving.
Let's go to the diner.

04:06.592 --> 04:09.495
- Fine.
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen, guys.

04:09.529 --> 04:12.632
What are you talking about?
Don't you know what day it is?

04:12.665 --> 04:17.337
It's the worst
driving day in Los Angeles.

04:17.370 --> 04:18.603
Oh, is it sprinkling?

04:18.637 --> 04:19.904
The Christmas parade?

04:19.939 --> 04:21.741
Obama's on Kimmel again?

04:21.774 --> 04:23.409
The march for the
Armenian thing?

04:23.443 --> 04:24.910
Bicycles taking over
the street day?

04:24.944 --> 04:26.746
Elmo fight outside
the Chinese Theater?

04:26.779 --> 04:28.681
Aah! The marathon is today. Oh.

04:28.714 --> 04:30.650
Oh, my God. They still do that?

04:30.683 --> 04:33.085
Well, I guess we're just gonna
have to be stuck here all day.

04:33.118 --> 04:34.720
No, we can't be!

04:35.788 --> 04:38.190
We're adults. We can walk!

04:41.394 --> 04:43.463
Okay.

04:43.496 --> 04:45.097
What are we, New Yorkers?

04:45.130 --> 04:47.099
Oh, fuggedaboutit.

04:47.132 --> 04:50.636
Let's walk and get a pizza bagel
with Mayor Giuliani.

04:52.972 --> 04:54.206
No.

04:56.676 --> 04:58.210
Do you know what, it's fine.

04:58.243 --> 05:00.112
We'll just.. take it easy

05:00.145 --> 05:02.615
and, uh, wait this thing out.

05:02.648 --> 05:03.816
I know.

05:06.486 --> 05:07.653
Beans on toast.

05:08.688 --> 05:10.623
Sounds disgusting,

05:10.656 --> 05:12.625
but on the spectrum
of English cooking,

05:12.658 --> 05:15.060
I would put it up there
with cabbage bread

05:15.094 --> 05:16.762
and lung pudding.

05:18.598 --> 05:20.633
Edgar, what have you done
to the bread bag?

05:20.666 --> 05:21.967
Oh, that was probably the mouse.

05:22.001 --> 05:24.404
The mouse? What mouse?!
We have a mouse?!

05:24.437 --> 05:26.138
I think he lives
in the laundry room.

05:26.171 --> 05:27.473
No, the-the garage.

05:27.507 --> 05:31.310
He made a-a little nest
out of Jimmy's unsold books.

05:31.343 --> 05:32.712
Sorry, let me get this straight.

05:32.745 --> 05:35.548
We have a mouse crawling through
the food that we ingest,

05:35.581 --> 05:36.982
and not only do you two

05:37.016 --> 05:38.150
know about it,

05:38.183 --> 05:40.252
but you're
absolutely unbothered?

05:40.285 --> 05:41.721
He's kind of cute.
Yeah, if he's not

05:41.754 --> 05:43.432
bothering anyone,
who cares that he's here?

05:43.456 --> 05:44.990
I do! Me!

05:45.024 --> 05:47.059
The person in whose
house you all live,

05:47.092 --> 05:49.995
which now, apparently,
includes vermin!

05:50.029 --> 05:51.831
Right, breakfast is canceled,

05:51.864 --> 05:53.866
because due to your
staggering apathy

05:53.899 --> 05:56.736
about living with the actual
cause of the plague itself,

05:56.769 --> 05:59.805
I will be busy
evicting this mouse!

06:01.073 --> 06:02.875
I'll help.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.349
You sure you're okay?

06:10.382 --> 06:13.018
Yeah. I'm amazing.

06:22.595 --> 06:24.464
You guys have fun.

06:26.065 --> 06:28.067
Dancing to no music.

06:40.513 --> 06:42.515
Oh, no!

06:44.283 --> 06:47.152
Hey, it's really cool of you
to let Dorothy crash here.

06:47.186 --> 06:49.154
Oh, yeah,
thanks for reminding me.

06:49.188 --> 06:52.257
I was too upset about
the mouse to properly yell.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.426
In what world is a freeloader

06:54.460 --> 06:56.896
allowed to invite
someone else to stay?

06:56.929 --> 06:58.731
That'd be like Kato Kaelin

06:58.764 --> 07:01.333
inviting someone to live in an
even tinier little guest house.

07:01.366 --> 07:03.435
So what do you think of Dorothy?

07:03.469 --> 07:05.938
Why would you care what people
think of your girlfriend?

07:05.971 --> 07:08.273
Gretchen's a lunatic of whom

07:08.307 --> 07:11.844
I should be profoundly ashamed,
and yet I'm not.

07:11.877 --> 07:13.979
That maniac goes out
in the middle of the night

07:14.013 --> 07:17.282
to cry in her car, and I'm like,
"Live and let live."

07:17.316 --> 07:18.283
That's where she's been going?

07:18.317 --> 07:19.519
Yeah, ap-apparently,

07:19.552 --> 07:20.920
it's sort of her thing.

07:20.953 --> 07:22.454
Whatever. Hakuna matata.

07:22.488 --> 07:23.989
Ah, no worries.

07:26.659 --> 07:29.161
Yeah, it's slightly
more nuanced than that,

07:29.194 --> 07:31.463
but, yeah, essentially.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.036
Um, are we gonna stop
doing this at some point?

07:37.069 --> 07:38.303
I got shin issues.

07:38.337 --> 07:39.471
Don't know.

07:39.505 --> 07:41.049
Hey, you want to do an Avocadon't?
Nope.

07:41.073 --> 07:42.942
It's this dumb thing
I do on Vine.

07:42.975 --> 07:45.645
Nope! Yeah, my most popular one
is where I try to breast-feed one

07:45.678 --> 07:47.780
and then I burp it
and guacamole flies everywhere.

07:47.813 --> 07:49.615
Nope! Hey, I'm gonna
go grab an avocado.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.917
I brought a bunch in my bag.
Nope, no, no, no!

07:55.988 --> 07:58.457
Aah! Lindsay! Thank God!

07:58.490 --> 08:00.192
We're dancing!

08:00.225 --> 08:02.127
Oh, my God, Gretch,

08:02.161 --> 08:05.030
it is literally 'Nam out there.

08:05.064 --> 08:07.032
There was so much traffic,

08:07.066 --> 08:08.343
I got through three
whole episodes

08:08.367 --> 08:11.837
of the Just Farts
podcast, and then

08:11.871 --> 08:13.081
I got to the thing,
and they wouldn't

08:13.105 --> 08:14.339
let me through the people,

08:14.373 --> 08:17.242
so I abandoned my car
and walked past the people

08:17.276 --> 08:18.678
and they yelled at me.

08:18.711 --> 08:20.179
And then some Asian boy gave me

08:20.212 --> 08:21.847
a cup of Gatorade,
which was weird.

08:21.881 --> 08:25.484
And then I walked
all the way here, uphill.

08:25.517 --> 08:27.687
And then I died. I'm dead.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.589
Talking about the marathon?
I guess.

08:29.622 --> 08:32.524
Whatever. I just had to get
out of Becca's stupid house.

08:32.558 --> 08:35.695
She makes me put the seat down
when I pee.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.830
What are you doing at
Becca's house? Wow.

08:37.863 --> 08:41.066
Gretch, you are really out
of the loop these days.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.202
I'm staying there because
I don't have any power,

08:43.235 --> 08:45.204
but Becca's driving me insane

08:45.237 --> 08:47.539
with "baby" this
and "her bump" that.

08:47.573 --> 08:50.676
Also, Vernon honked my boob.

08:50.710 --> 08:52.144
Oh, my God,
is that your real voice?

08:54.213 --> 08:55.615
Who's the rando?

08:55.648 --> 08:57.182
Don't know. Theater girl.

08:57.216 --> 08:58.718
She was here when I woke up.

08:58.751 --> 09:00.219
Lindsay!

09:00.252 --> 09:02.221
Did you meet Dorothy?

09:02.254 --> 09:04.056
She's crashing with
me for a while.

09:04.089 --> 09:05.390
What? Uh, yeah.

09:05.424 --> 09:07.359
Anyway, you guys

09:07.392 --> 09:09.862
would probably
like each other a lot.

09:09.895 --> 09:11.130
You both like naps.

09:11.163 --> 09:13.065
Dorothy, tell Lindsay

09:13.098 --> 09:15.067
about that nap you
took the other day.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.602
I napped in a sunbeam.

09:16.636 --> 09:18.537
See? Anyway, I'm gonna

09:18.570 --> 09:19.872
go get Jimmy some gloves.

09:19.905 --> 09:21.473
It's, uh, it's not going well.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.409
You guys,

09:24.443 --> 09:26.578
traffic is banonkers.

09:26.612 --> 09:28.413
I had to ditch the Beemer
and hoof it up here.

09:28.447 --> 09:30.716
Do you know your car is parked
in the middle of Alvarado?

09:30.750 --> 09:31.917
I could tell it was yours

09:31.951 --> 09:33.161
from the wine bottle
in the cup holder.

09:33.185 --> 09:36.055
Who's the rando? Oh, Dorothy.

09:36.088 --> 09:38.590
I have a patient
named Dorothy. She's 92.

09:38.624 --> 09:41.761
Oh, shit. I forgot.
She died last week.

09:41.794 --> 09:45.497
Osteoporos. Her entire skeleton
basically liquefied.

09:45.530 --> 09:47.432
Girls, drink your milk.

09:47.466 --> 09:49.101
And 1.3% of men.

09:49.134 --> 09:51.036
I need to talk to you,
solamente.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.608
Come on, theater girl!

09:56.642 --> 09:59.244
And five and six
and seven and eight!

10:07.987 --> 10:09.955
Bed booze!
Why didn't I think of that?

10:09.989 --> 10:11.123
What do you want, Vernon?

10:11.156 --> 10:12.692
Please don't tell Becca
what happened

10:12.725 --> 10:13.959
in the man cave last night.

10:13.993 --> 10:17.096
Oh, that? Whatever.
It felt good.

10:17.129 --> 10:19.331
I won't tell. Really? Okay.

10:19.364 --> 10:21.000
Shit, you are one chill lady.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.135
That is a relief. I just...

10:23.168 --> 10:24.780
feel so lonely lately.
I said I won't tell.

10:24.804 --> 10:28.140
Bec and I used to have so much
fun, but when I come home now,

10:28.173 --> 10:29.975
I can never win,
'cause she's talking about

10:30.009 --> 10:33.512
how she's harnessing
the very power of life itself,

10:33.545 --> 10:37.149
so who gives a crap if I just
made it so some old biddy

10:37.182 --> 10:39.284
will be able
to plant bulbs next spring?

10:39.318 --> 10:41.987
And really, let's be honest,

10:42.021 --> 10:43.823
Bec is just milking this shit

10:43.856 --> 10:46.391
so she can be
a 24/7 snack monster

10:46.425 --> 10:48.160
and Jabba all over the place.

10:48.193 --> 10:50.730
She won't even let me do her
anymore 'cause she's afraid

10:50.763 --> 10:53.498
the baby might
come out wack. Shit!

10:53.532 --> 10:56.668
I don't want some
wack-ass baby, but I have needs.

10:56.702 --> 11:00.139
Anyway, I appreciate
your staying discreet.

11:00.172 --> 11:03.042
I promise. Okay, cool. You
want me to give you some money?

11:05.044 --> 11:06.678
What? Just... take some cash.

11:06.712 --> 11:08.180
It'll make me feel better.

11:19.558 --> 11:22.928
Okay. That feels
really good. I mean,

11:22.962 --> 11:24.897
it feels good
to get that stuff off my chest.

11:39.078 --> 11:41.213
Why are we dancing?
Gretchen's doing it.

11:41.246 --> 11:43.415
It's your boy
Trace on Fire, 103!

11:43.448 --> 11:45.084
We got Honey Nutz and S-stain

11:45.117 --> 11:47.086
with a response
to Sam Dresden's dis track.

11:47.119 --> 11:48.453
This is "Phony Hawk."

11:48.487 --> 11:49.755
Yeah, these are my boys!

11:51.256 --> 11:53.292
Oh, I'm a P.R. genius.

11:53.325 --> 11:56.561
So the feud's working? Yeah!

11:56.595 --> 11:59.298
Maybe a little too well. Ooh!

11:59.331 --> 12:01.901
Jesus, these lyrics are mean!

12:01.934 --> 12:04.636
Sam's so gonna fire me.

12:04.669 --> 12:06.705
Whatever. Jobs are dumb.

12:06.738 --> 12:08.607
Hakuna matata!

12:08.640 --> 12:10.475
So, what do you think
of Dorothy?

12:10.509 --> 12:11.743
Pretty great, huh?

12:13.112 --> 12:14.146
She a'ight.

12:14.179 --> 12:15.380
Where's the mouse?!

12:15.414 --> 12:16.748
It ran in here!

12:18.017 --> 12:20.019
Hello?

12:23.622 --> 12:25.724
Why is no one helping me
catch this mouse?

12:25.757 --> 12:27.602
You need a mouse? Shit,
we got, like, hundreds of them

12:27.626 --> 12:29.805
in the lab at work; I'll
jack you all the mice you need.

12:29.829 --> 12:31.330
You're all just dancing,

12:31.363 --> 12:33.565
like some uncoordinated
doomsday cult,

12:33.598 --> 12:35.300
while vermin run around
unchecked.

12:35.334 --> 12:37.502
And why are
Vernon and Lindsay here?

12:37.536 --> 12:38.503
Right?

12:38.537 --> 12:39.972
I ran through the people.

12:40.005 --> 12:42.875
Please, will everyone be quiet
for one goddamn minute!

12:49.681 --> 12:51.951
I think it's under the fridge.

12:51.984 --> 12:54.686
Gretchen,
why don't you come help me.

12:54.719 --> 12:55.855
Comin' at ya!

12:59.391 --> 13:00.659
Hummus?

13:00.692 --> 13:02.361
No.

13:02.394 --> 13:04.463
Hold this.

13:09.902 --> 13:10.836
Hey.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.637
So, what's up with you?

13:12.671 --> 13:14.606
Taking apart a fridge,
looking for a mouse.

13:14.639 --> 13:15.807
Yeah, but why?

13:15.841 --> 13:17.209
Is it fun?

13:17.242 --> 13:19.811
Why is this mouse
such a big deal?

13:19.845 --> 13:22.014
I just want to catch the mouse.

13:22.047 --> 13:24.549
There's no greater
significance to it. Oh.

13:26.585 --> 13:29.054
My childhood home had mice.

13:29.088 --> 13:30.856
I thought nothing of it.

13:30.890 --> 13:33.492
One day, my mate Daniel
spent the night,

13:33.525 --> 13:35.827
and he woke up to a mouse
chewing on his nipple.

13:35.861 --> 13:37.829
From then on,

13:37.863 --> 13:39.698
everybody called me Mouse Boy.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.667
My dad, even... and it was
his disgusting house.

13:42.701 --> 13:44.669
See, that's the thing
about my father...

13:44.703 --> 13:45.837
Oh, God.

13:45.871 --> 13:47.839
So then, in the next scene,

13:47.873 --> 13:50.209
Dorothy switched from
playing the pet shop owner

13:50.242 --> 13:52.077
to being one of the cats,

13:52.111 --> 13:55.480
and she coughed up
a giant hairball.

13:55.514 --> 13:57.182
It was so gross.

13:57.216 --> 14:00.085
Oh, my God, that's hilarious!

14:00.119 --> 14:01.887
Hey, Dorothy, you got
to teach me something.

14:01.921 --> 14:03.889
I bet I'd be real
good at improv.

14:03.923 --> 14:05.724
I once made a patient
laugh so hard,

14:05.757 --> 14:07.259
she peed all over the table.

14:07.292 --> 14:08.760
I mean, she was 89,

14:08.793 --> 14:10.862
and her pelvic floor was wack,
but... yeah.

14:10.896 --> 14:12.097
Sure, okay.

14:12.131 --> 14:13.432
Um, we could start

14:13.465 --> 14:15.634
with a simple
mirroring exercise.

14:18.803 --> 14:21.540
So, pretend that
you're my reflection.

14:21.573 --> 14:22.975
Okay.

14:24.476 --> 14:26.878
No, mirror me.

14:26.912 --> 14:29.614
Ha! Can't fool me... everything's
backwards in a mirror.

14:29.648 --> 14:32.451
Eh, okay, um...

14:32.484 --> 14:34.586
Are you mad at me?

14:34.619 --> 14:35.955
No. Why?

14:35.988 --> 14:38.723
I just feel like we
had a connection...

14:38.757 --> 14:40.425
that was fun and exciting.

14:40.459 --> 14:41.927
You know? Like...

14:41.961 --> 14:44.429
new and different and
full of possibilities,

14:44.463 --> 14:46.131
and now you're so busy.

14:46.165 --> 14:48.133
I miss you.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.702
You should come hang out
with me and Dorothy sometime.

14:50.735 --> 14:52.972
But I'm doing it
like in a mirror.

14:53.005 --> 14:54.306
Rando.

14:54.339 --> 14:55.616
I feel like you're
trying to trick me.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.985
I absolutely am not.
This is boring.

14:57.009 --> 14:59.111
I want to do a scene
where I get to be hilarious

14:59.144 --> 15:00.980
and talk in a funny voice.
Or be a lady.

15:01.013 --> 15:02.747
Hey, you want to do
an Avocadon't with me?

15:02.781 --> 15:03.915
Hell yeah. What is that,

15:03.949 --> 15:05.617
like, things not to do
with an avocado?

15:05.650 --> 15:07.486
Yes, actually.

15:07.519 --> 15:09.488
I'll be right back.

15:09.521 --> 15:10.822
Psst. Hey.

15:10.855 --> 15:13.092
Listen, rando, slow your roll.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.659
Oh, my God, is this about Edgar?

15:14.693 --> 15:16.461
I am so sorry. I had no idea

15:16.495 --> 15:17.829
that you guys were a thing.

15:17.862 --> 15:19.999
Because he has literally
never mentioned you.

15:20.032 --> 15:22.267
Well, he's kind of
my backup side bitch,

15:22.301 --> 15:23.602
and he likes it.

15:23.635 --> 15:24.636
So maybe just,

15:24.669 --> 15:27.806
like, respect that. 'Kay?

15:32.144 --> 15:35.014
Goddamn it, I heard it in here!

15:35.047 --> 15:38.183
Maybe you should summon it
with your Mouse Boy powers.

15:39.218 --> 15:41.486
How much have you been drinking?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.188
I don't know, like, seven?

15:43.222 --> 15:44.456
What is going on with you?!

15:44.489 --> 15:46.525
The only thing going on with me

15:46.558 --> 15:49.494
is I am trying to make due
being stuck in this house,

15:49.528 --> 15:51.530
and you're obsessed
with this stupid mouse!

15:51.563 --> 15:53.565
I know, let's do shots.

15:56.535 --> 15:58.037
Oh, my God, we're out of booze.

15:58.070 --> 16:00.172
Good. I think you've had enough.

16:00.205 --> 16:02.274
You've had enough. Edgar!

16:02.307 --> 16:04.376
Edgar! We're out of booze.

16:04.409 --> 16:07.046
We'll make a run later.

16:07.079 --> 16:09.281
M-Maybe Jimmy's right.

16:09.314 --> 16:10.515
Relax.

16:10.549 --> 16:13.685
Relax? Says the guy
so riddled with anxiety

16:13.718 --> 16:15.987
he can't sleep through the
night without screaming!

16:16.021 --> 16:17.556
Yes, well, uh, we all know

16:17.589 --> 16:20.059
that I'm taking
the prescribed steps to overcome

16:20.092 --> 16:22.394
the very common issues
caused by combat situations.

16:22.427 --> 16:24.529
Ugh! We know. You were in a war.

16:24.563 --> 16:25.730
Get over it!

16:25.764 --> 16:28.733
And while you're at it,
get over Lindsay.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.070
Have enough self-respect
not to focus on someone

16:31.103 --> 16:34.373
who's still clearly obsessed
with her lame, soft ex-husband.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.575
This is really hard for me.

16:36.608 --> 16:38.210
Oh. "Waah."

16:38.243 --> 16:40.512
"My husband left me
for a female him,

16:40.545 --> 16:42.914
and now I can't function
in life. Waah!"

16:44.616 --> 16:45.917
Oh, and you!

16:45.950 --> 16:47.219
Theater girl!

16:47.252 --> 16:48.687
Yes? Improv is

16:48.720 --> 16:50.389
the lowest form of comedy.

16:50.422 --> 16:52.557
That whole school of
yours is just a bunch

16:52.591 --> 16:54.359
of actors so janky-looking

16:54.393 --> 16:56.228
no one will write lines
for them,

16:56.261 --> 16:58.363
so you have
to make them up yourself.

16:58.397 --> 17:01.100
Aw, shit. You're what
this town calls a tweener.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.735
You're not hot enough
to be the lead,

17:03.768 --> 17:05.604
and not fat enough to
be the funny friend.

17:05.637 --> 17:06.704
You already did me!

17:06.738 --> 17:08.240
Do me, do me.

17:08.272 --> 17:09.907
Not worth it. Aw, man.

17:09.941 --> 17:13.112
Look, as spectacularly
entertaining as this is,

17:13.145 --> 17:14.878
maybe you should take
a breather.

17:14.913 --> 17:17.582
And then there's Jimmy.

17:17.616 --> 17:18.782
Aw, shit.

17:18.817 --> 17:20.252
No, seriously,

17:20.285 --> 17:23.288
Jimmy, I feel
such empathy for you,

17:23.321 --> 17:25.424
being a writer.

17:25.457 --> 17:27.126
I mean, everyone
feels sorry for kids

17:27.159 --> 17:28.893
forced to work in
the diamond mines

17:28.927 --> 17:31.896
in Sierra Leone,
but where is the telethon

17:31.930 --> 17:34.099
for the noble writer?

17:34.133 --> 17:36.935
Bravely drinking coffee,

17:36.968 --> 17:39.238
spilling his blood
to get his feelings out,

17:39.271 --> 17:42.040
filling two, maybe
three whole pages

17:42.073 --> 17:43.775
before his heroic effort

17:43.808 --> 17:46.811
is cut short by the desire
to watch Internet porn

17:46.845 --> 17:48.613
or get a snack!

17:48.647 --> 17:49.781
All of you!

17:49.814 --> 17:51.750
Sucking the air out of the room

17:51.783 --> 17:55.120
with your self-pity-riddled
non-problems!

17:55.154 --> 17:56.988
Except you, Vernon.
You got real issues.

17:57.021 --> 17:58.157
You're married to Becca.

17:58.190 --> 18:00.992
Ha! Vernon, ya burnt!

18:01.025 --> 18:04.129
This place is
an emotional black hole,

18:04.163 --> 18:05.664
and if it wasn't
for the runners...

18:05.697 --> 18:07.466
Yes, they have a name,

18:07.499 --> 18:10.169
they're not just "the people,"
you giant doofus...

18:10.202 --> 18:11.670
I would be driving

18:11.703 --> 18:13.905
as fast as I could
away from you all!

18:13.938 --> 18:16.107
But I can't! Because apparently,

18:16.141 --> 18:19.278
I live here now, due to
completely-beyond-my-control

18:19.311 --> 18:22.013
wiring issues for which
there will be a lawsuit.

18:22.046 --> 18:24.849
Yes! There will be a lawsuit!

18:26.218 --> 18:27.819
There will be no lawsuit.

18:27.852 --> 18:29.154
Mouse. We know!

18:29.188 --> 18:31.656
Mouse, mouse! We get it, Jimmy.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.024
No. The mouse!

18:43.535 --> 18:45.537
It's back, isn't it?

18:46.571 --> 18:48.373
It's gonna be like

18:48.407 --> 18:51.276
sophomore year when you wore
the same Hoobastank T-shirt

18:51.310 --> 18:53.845
three weeks in a row and only
ate Special K Red Berries?

18:56.515 --> 18:58.217
Are you gonna tell Jimmy?

18:58.250 --> 19:01.620
No. I can't tell him
my brain is broken.

19:01.653 --> 19:03.722
Gretchen, you have never

19:03.755 --> 19:07.226
been this much your
disgusting self around anyone.

19:07.259 --> 19:09.027
I would have killed
to let Paul in

19:09.060 --> 19:11.863
on all my gross secrets,
but I was too ashamed of them.

19:11.896 --> 19:14.566
Like how I like
to drink soy sauce.

19:14.599 --> 19:16.868
Or how I once sucked
Malcolm-Jamal Warner's dick

19:16.901 --> 19:18.237
at Barney's Beanery.

19:18.270 --> 19:20.572
Lindsay...

19:20.605 --> 19:22.517
If anyone's gonna be okay
with who you are, it's Jimmy.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.576
You guys went into this
both knowing

19:24.609 --> 19:27.178
you're total creeps, so don't
start keeping secrets now.

19:27.212 --> 19:29.080
Wear your stains

19:29.113 --> 19:31.750
on the outsides
of your clothes, Gretch.

19:32.784 --> 19:34.419
Tell him.

19:34.453 --> 19:36.688
I can't.

19:46.231 --> 19:48.900
Aw...

19:53.572 --> 19:54.939
I think his leg is broken.

19:54.973 --> 19:57.041
We have to put it
out of its misery.

19:57.075 --> 19:58.686
You want me to throw it
in the neighbor's yard?

19:58.710 --> 19:59.954
They got a couple
of hyper corgis.

19:59.978 --> 20:01.580
No, we should give him
a Viking funeral

20:01.613 --> 20:03.548
in the reservoir.
I'll just squash it.

20:03.582 --> 20:05.550
No! Jesus.

20:05.584 --> 20:06.951
No.

20:06.985 --> 20:09.621
As much as I hate mice
and everything they represent,

20:09.654 --> 20:11.656
this one put up a good fight.

20:12.957 --> 20:15.794
It deserves to die
as humanely as possible.

20:28.172 --> 20:30.008
Do you want
to improvise a eulogy?

20:32.744 --> 20:34.546
I'm afraid,
even though this speech

20:34.579 --> 20:37.382
is a little cheesy,
I Muenster continue.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.150
Gouda day, little guy.

20:39.183 --> 20:40.685
Goddamn it, she's good.

20:42.521 --> 20:45.457
So... yeah.

20:45.490 --> 20:47.659
Uh...

20:47.692 --> 20:50.629
I have been drinking all day.

20:50.662 --> 20:53.298
But this is me apologizing

20:53.332 --> 20:54.999
to you all...

20:56.000 --> 20:57.602
I-Is the mouse in that box?

20:57.636 --> 20:59.304
Shh.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.172
Rocket ship to Heaven.

21:01.205 --> 21:02.507
How did we

21:02.541 --> 21:04.809
barely even hang today?
I'm about to start

21:04.843 --> 21:06.578
my annual Arliss
re-watch. You in?

21:06.611 --> 21:08.447
I'll FaceTime you.

21:10.882 --> 21:13.752
I don't think your friends
like me very much.

21:13.785 --> 21:16.120
What?! Of course they do.

21:16.154 --> 21:18.957
The only nice one was
that loud ginger dude.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.125
He isn't really a doctor, is he?

21:21.159 --> 21:22.894
I-I like you.

21:25.063 --> 21:26.197
Well...

21:26.230 --> 21:27.699
that's that.

21:27.732 --> 21:30.635
As Khalid always says,
"The circle of life."

21:30.669 --> 21:32.637
Hey, do you want
to get out of here?

21:32.671 --> 21:34.038
The marathon should be over.

21:34.072 --> 21:36.808
I mean, by this time,
there's still always, like,

21:36.841 --> 21:39.644
a blind guy
or a torso in the wheelchair,

21:39.678 --> 21:41.546
but they keep them to one lane.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.181
It's okay.

21:43.214 --> 21:46.317
The-the torsos usually have,
like, really devoted dads

21:46.351 --> 21:48.520
who... push-push them.

21:50.922 --> 21:53.257
What's going on with you?

21:54.258 --> 21:55.827
Okay.

21:55.860 --> 21:59.163
So, here's an interesting thing
that you don't know about me.

21:59.197 --> 22:01.866
I am clinically depressed.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.502
It's been going on

22:03.535 --> 22:06.571
my whole life, so I'm actually
really good at handling it.

22:06.605 --> 22:09.374
Uh, it strikes me whenever,
and I have no idea why.

22:09.408 --> 22:11.710
But it's fine.
I'm sorry I never told you.

22:11.743 --> 22:13.011
Slipped my mind.

22:13.044 --> 22:14.713
And who knows,

22:14.746 --> 22:16.415
with the right attitude,

22:16.448 --> 22:19.250
this could be a really fun
adventure for everyone.

22:19.283 --> 22:20.919
So the only thing

22:20.952 --> 22:23.422
I need from you is
to not make a big deal of it,

22:23.455 --> 22:27.459
and be okay with how I am, and
the fact that you can't fix me.

22:29.394 --> 22:31.029
Can't I, though?

22:32.130 --> 22:33.932
I got that mouse.

22:35.299 --> 22:36.435
Yeah.

22:45.810 --> 22:49.113
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

23:33.458 --> 23:37.261
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

23:45.837 --> 23:48.740
A fantasy league
is like a family...

23:48.773 --> 23:50.108
Said no one ever.

23:50.141 --> 23:52.777
I have achieved more
than I ever thought possible...

23:52.811 --> 23:55.313
A checking account,
unlimited texting.

23:55.346 --> 23:58.249
Win or lose, it's how
you play your friends.

23:58.282 --> 24:01.686
Do I have any regrets?
Yeah. Tony Romo.

24:01.720 --> 24:05.590
History is not written by the winners.
It's written by the cheaters.

24:05.624 --> 24:08.660
My mother always wondered,
how low can you go?

24:08.693 --> 24:10.261
Well, Mom, pretty low.

24:10.294 --> 24:13.031

24:13.064 --> 24:15.500

Fargo.

24:33.552 --> 24:35.720

24:35.754 --> 24:37.522
All new Wednesdays at 10:00.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.725

24:40.759 --> 24:42.827
- Yikes.
- Ha-ha!

24:42.861 --> 24:44.495
- Hoo!

24:44.529 --> 24:46.998
R-R-R-Remix! Oh!

24:47.031 --> 24:49.033
- The all new season.
- Yaah!

24:49.067 --> 24:49.901
Aaah!

24:49.934 --> 24:52.036
Sunny returns January.

24:52.070 --> 24:53.538
Only on FXX.

24:54.739 --> 24:56.641
Who are you guys?

24:56.675 --> 24:58.509
- We have come to have sex with you.
- Holy...

25:00.278 --> 25:02.446
What are you
looking for exactly?

25:08.519 --> 25:10.555
Why not get
surgically conjoined?

25:10.589 --> 25:14.525
Man Seeking Woman. An all
new season January on FXX.
