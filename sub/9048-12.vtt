WEBVTT

00:01.181 --> 00:02.181
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:03.626 --> 00:05.226
- It's senior year!
- Last ranking?

00:05.228 --> 00:06.661
- T, I am 137!

00:06.663 --> 00:07.862
- This is just like
sophomore year.

00:07.864 --> 00:10.631
He's getting what he wants,
and you're not.

00:10.633 --> 00:11.699
- About last night...

00:11.701 --> 00:13.100
Nothing happened
between me and Matty.

00:13.102 --> 00:16.938
He just wanted to talk.
I'm pregnant.

00:18.508 --> 00:20.708
It was the middle of finals
and the student body had turned into

00:20.710 --> 00:22.677
a throng of over-caffeinated
strung-out zombies.

00:22.679 --> 00:24.445
These were the last grades
colleges would see.

00:24.447 --> 00:27.114
They could make the difference
between going to Harvard

00:27.116 --> 00:27.982
or working at Hollister.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.818
- Have you noticed how sad and
the city Eva's been looking?

00:30.820 --> 00:31.953
What's that bish's biggest ish,

00:31.955 --> 00:34.789
how hot she and Matty
will look at prom?

00:34.791 --> 00:36.657
- You never know what people
are going through.

00:36.659 --> 00:38.826
Which is what I'm trying to
tell myself about Luke--

00:38.828 --> 00:40.728
the fact that he's ignored
my apology text.

00:40.730 --> 00:43.464
- Jenna, you left that dude out
in the cold, literally.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.800
On a mountain next to a creepy
statue of a bear.

00:45.802 --> 00:48.870
- Which is why I'm doubling down
with a grand gesture--

00:48.872 --> 00:49.937
something he can't ignore.

00:49.939 --> 00:51.539
- Well, good luck.
Call me after.

00:51.541 --> 00:54.208
I want all the Deets by Dre.

00:55.244 --> 00:57.645
- With everything else going on,
the last thing I needed

00:57.647 --> 00:59.780
was to get sucked into
another Eva drama.

00:59.782 --> 01:01.849
But I had to know Matty
was okay.

01:01.851 --> 01:03.651
Hey, how are you?

01:03.653 --> 01:05.920
- I'm, uh, I'm okay.

01:05.922 --> 01:06.687
- Really?

01:06.689 --> 01:10.024
- Matty, I don't want to
tell you who to talk to,

01:10.026 --> 01:11.559
but this is making me
really upset.

01:11.561 --> 01:16.564
And they say stress is bad
for our baby.

01:17.733 --> 01:20.735
Bye.

01:21.803 --> 01:24.705
- Hey, Liss, you wanna come over
and study?

01:24.707 --> 01:28.509
- Thanks, but I'm going home
with Tyler.

01:28.511 --> 01:30.211
I mean, Tyler's giving me
a ride home,

01:30.213 --> 01:34.916
because we're brother and sister
and we live in the same house.

01:34.918 --> 01:36.617
- Have you guys seen Sadie?

01:36.619 --> 01:37.652
- Since when are you friends?

01:37.654 --> 01:39.153
- There's just something
really weird going on

01:39.155 --> 01:42.023
I need to talk to her about.
- No, there's not.

01:42.025 --> 01:43.691
Everything's normal.

01:43.693 --> 01:47.662
- Sadita, <i>andale,</i> we have to be
at the art walk in an hour.

01:47.664 --> 01:48.296
- Hold on, Sergio.

01:48.298 --> 01:50.665
Not all our lives
revolve around bratwurst.

01:50.667 --> 01:54.835
- Yeah, yours just revolves
around being a brat--come on.

01:54.837 --> 01:55.770
- Sadie, wait.

01:55.772 --> 01:56.637
- What, Hamiltrash?

01:56.639 --> 01:59.807
- I'm really worried about Matty
and he won't talk to me, so--

01:59.809 --> 02:01.175
- let me spell this out for you.

02:01.177 --> 02:04.779
That psycho
has him in her clutches.

02:04.781 --> 02:05.880
There's nothing we can do.

02:05.882 --> 02:09.083
As long as she's knocked up,
we're shut down.

02:09.085 --> 02:12.019
- Sadie, I am asking you
as a friend.

02:12.021 --> 02:12.653
- Ew!

02:12.655 --> 02:14.889
Whatever happened on that
mountain, Hamilqueef,

02:14.891 --> 02:16.090
we are not friends!

02:16.092 --> 02:18.593
Let's go.
[Engine turns]

02:20.729 --> 02:22.863
[Splash]

02:24.333 --> 02:26.067
- Things didn't go well
with Matty today.

02:26.069 --> 02:30.004
Or Sadie, but hopefully,
they'd go better with Luke.

02:30.006 --> 02:31.672
- Jenna.
- I know I screwed up

02:31.674 --> 02:33.874
on the ski trip,
and I am so, so, sorry.

02:33.876 --> 02:35.242
- Jenna, you don't have to
apologize.

02:35.244 --> 02:39.180
- No, no, now this is a care
package that I made for you.

02:39.182 --> 02:41.015
- That's really sweet.

02:41.017 --> 02:41.949
Hey, I--
- coffee, and...

02:41.951 --> 02:43.217
Oh, and like,
cute little toothbrush.

02:43.219 --> 02:44.619
- Jen, I really have to--

02:44.621 --> 02:47.054
- oh, and there might even be
a little gift certificate

02:47.056 --> 02:48.322
for a neck massage.

02:48.324 --> 02:51.125
And, um, cookies.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.761
- Babe, we have to hurry.

02:53.763 --> 02:54.362
Oh, hello.

02:54.364 --> 02:55.763
Babe, is this your
little sister?

02:55.765 --> 03:00.635
- No, she's my--
- ooh, mint chocolate crisps.

03:00.637 --> 03:01.302
Good luck to the troop.

03:01.304 --> 03:02.970
C'mon, babe, concert
starts in 20 minutes.

03:02.972 --> 03:07.742
Let's go.
- I can totally explain this.

03:14.016 --> 03:15.349
- Tell. Me. Everything.

03:15.351 --> 03:17.251
- It didn't go quite as planned.

03:17.253 --> 03:18.653
There was another girl there,

03:18.655 --> 03:19.787
and I've been checking Twitter

03:19.789 --> 03:21.889
and Facebook and Vine,
and I can't find her.

03:21.891 --> 03:23.891
And Luke hasn't changed
his relationship status,

03:23.893 --> 03:25.126
and I don't know
what's going on.

03:25.128 --> 03:27.728
- Jenna, this is finals.
You need to focus.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.396
- How can I focus

03:28.398 --> 03:30.164
with everything
that I'm going through?

03:30.166 --> 03:31.198
- Start with some caffeine.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.669
This is it Jenna,
this is defcon-ten, or one.

03:34.671 --> 03:36.370
I can never remember
which one is worse.

03:36.372 --> 03:37.304
[Bleep] Up or buck up.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.273
It's your only choices,
so what's it gonna be?

03:39.275 --> 03:42.109
- Tamara had a point--colleges
wouldn't care that I was

03:42.111 --> 03:43.844
grieving the loss of
a relationship

03:43.846 --> 03:45.680
or what Matty
was going through

03:45.682 --> 03:46.914
when I took my finals.

03:46.916 --> 03:49.383
I needed to compartmentalize,
and fast.

03:49.385 --> 03:51.686
Bucking it up and sucking it up.

03:51.688 --> 03:55.256
- All seniors, please report
to the auditorium immediately.

03:55.258 --> 03:56.323
- I'll leave now.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.025
You stay here
for five more hours

03:58.027 --> 03:58.993
so no one gets suspicious.

03:58.995 --> 04:01.362
- How 'bout five more minutes?

04:01.364 --> 04:03.330
- Deal!

04:11.273 --> 04:12.173
- Hello, Lissa.

04:12.175 --> 04:15.109
You've been acting weird
ever since the ski trip.

04:15.111 --> 04:16.110
What's up with that?

04:16.112 --> 04:17.745
- Nothing.
Nothing's up.

04:17.747 --> 04:19.413
- Bull[Bleep].
You're glowing.

04:19.415 --> 04:21.248
[Gasps]
I knew it!

04:21.250 --> 04:23.350
You've been making out.
You bit your lip.

04:23.352 --> 04:26.320
That's your tell.
Who is in that room?

04:26.322 --> 04:29.090
- Girls, come on, assembly,
let's go.

04:29.092 --> 04:31.459
- This isn't over.
- [Amplified] This isn't over.

04:31.461 --> 04:36.797
Much like Wreckx, senior year
is still very much in effect.

04:36.799 --> 04:40.134
Finals are tomorrow,
and you all need to focus.

04:40.136 --> 04:42.470
But that's not why
I called you here.

04:42.472 --> 04:45.706
There's been an outbreak
of pregnant.

04:45.708 --> 04:48.142
[Students murmuring]

04:48.144 --> 04:51.145
Let's remember safe sex,
people.

04:51.147 --> 04:53.214
You know what that means.

04:53.216 --> 04:54.315
Frenchies, handies--

04:54.317 --> 04:57.151
- I can't believe she's telling
everybody about you.

04:57.153 --> 04:58.219
- She didn't say my name.

04:58.221 --> 05:00.888
- How did she find out?
This isn't cool.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.289
- Who's auditioning for
<i>Teen Mom 3?</i>

05:02.291 --> 05:05.760
- It's Eva! She's a liar
and she trapped Matty.

05:05.762 --> 05:07.061
Eva! Eva! Eva!

05:07.063 --> 05:08.028
I have no idea.

05:08.030 --> 05:10.164
- [Gasps]
Is it you?

05:10.166 --> 05:11.732
Luke sperminated
then terminated you?

05:11.734 --> 05:14.902
Well, I will just defer college
and we'll raise this baby

05:14.904 --> 05:17.104
together in a non-sexual life
partnership.

05:17.106 --> 05:18.739
No offense--
you're not really my type.

05:18.741 --> 05:20.941
Now, what are we thinking
for the nursery?

05:20.943 --> 05:21.842
- T, not knocked up,

05:21.844 --> 05:24.078
and ease up on the energy
drinks, okay?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.045
- No-kay, and thank God.

05:25.047 --> 05:29.016
- Mutie-masties, withdrawal,
sixty--

05:29.018 --> 05:30.518
- [whispering]
- Uh, correction.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.120
Withdrawal
does not actually work.

05:33.122 --> 05:34.955
- You, you, we need to talk.

05:34.957 --> 05:36.524
- Honey, I'm so glad
you wanna talk.

05:36.526 --> 05:37.958
I've been really worried
about you.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.928
- Which one of you told
Ms. Marks that I was pregnant?

05:40.930 --> 05:43.197
- I'm sorry, who's Eva?

05:43.199 --> 05:45.099
Oh, you mean Amber.

05:45.101 --> 05:46.400
Why would I waste my time...
- Yes.

05:46.402 --> 05:48.035
- Talking to
that dip[Bleep] Val

05:48.037 --> 05:49.036
about that skeevy sluntbag?

05:49.038 --> 05:51.338
Maybe Ms. Marks was talking
about someone else.

05:51.340 --> 05:54.441
This school's full of whores.

05:55.177 --> 05:57.978
- Hey Lissa.
- Hey.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.180
Hey!

05:59.182 --> 06:00.981
- You and Ms. Marks
are pretty tight.

06:00.983 --> 06:05.953
- Matty, I think the one thing
you would know about me by now

06:05.955 --> 06:07.855
is that I can keep a secret.

06:07.857 --> 06:08.422
- You promise?

06:08.424 --> 06:13.227
- Remember how long
I kept us a secret?

06:13.229 --> 06:14.361
- Thank you.

06:14.363 --> 06:16.063
- Yeah.

06:16.065 --> 06:18.065
I promise.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.535
- My stats book has to be here
somewhere.

06:21.537 --> 06:25.206
- Don't worry about that
right now.

06:27.876 --> 06:32.346
So, I guess you're not attracted
to me now that I'm pregnant?

06:32.348 --> 06:33.180
- It's not that.

06:33.182 --> 06:35.082
It's just my mom's
right down the hall.

06:35.084 --> 06:36.183
- No, no, I get it.

06:36.185 --> 06:39.286
I'm all used up now
and I'm gonna get fat--

06:39.288 --> 06:41.121
- oh, hey, come on.

06:41.123 --> 06:44.225
You know you're beautiful.

06:46.561 --> 06:48.395
[Knocking]

06:48.397 --> 06:49.463
- Mrs. McKibben.

06:49.465 --> 06:50.464
- Eva, hi.
- Hi.

06:50.466 --> 06:51.398
- It's nice to see you.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.834
Matty, have you seen my diamond
snowflake earrings?

06:53.836 --> 06:54.902
I can't find them anywhere,

06:54.904 --> 06:57.071
and I really want to
wear them tonight.

06:57.073 --> 06:59.874
- I haven't seen them.

06:59.876 --> 07:00.307
- Wait!

07:00.309 --> 07:04.245
Matty, do you want to tell
your mom something?

07:04.247 --> 07:07.047
- Yeah, we're going to, uh,

07:07.049 --> 07:08.949
school for a study session.

07:08.951 --> 07:13.287
- That's great.
Have fun.

07:14.456 --> 07:17.057
- When are you gonna
tell your mom I'm pregnant?

07:17.059 --> 07:18.959
We need to talk about
our future.

07:18.961 --> 07:20.261
- I know.
- I want us to spend

07:20.263 --> 07:23.297
our lives together,
but maybe you don't.

07:23.299 --> 07:24.865
I was raised by a single woman.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.902
I can do this alone
if you're not willing to commit.

07:27.904 --> 07:29.169
- I'm willing.

07:29.171 --> 07:32.206
I mean, I-I want to.

07:32.208 --> 07:35.276
So tomorrow, after finals,

07:35.278 --> 07:40.080
why don't we go looking
at engagement rings?

07:44.686 --> 07:45.586
- Attention students.

07:45.588 --> 07:46.987
Late night java
is now being served

07:46.989 --> 07:48.255
in the cafeteria.
Happy studying.

07:48.257 --> 07:50.190
- Listen, it's only
a matter of time

07:50.192 --> 07:52.326
before Sadie finds out
about us.

07:52.328 --> 07:53.193
I have to do something,

07:53.195 --> 07:54.995
and I need you to trust
that it's for us,

07:54.997 --> 07:57.298
because no one can know
what sinners we are.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.333
- What are you talking about?

07:59.335 --> 08:02.069
- I got us a beard.

08:04.239 --> 08:08.509
Jake, you're so smart.
Can you explain this to me?

08:08.511 --> 08:10.678
- Well, the z score--

08:10.680 --> 08:13.714
you look really great
in that dress.

08:13.716 --> 08:16.550
- Yeah, that dress
is pretty revealing.

08:16.552 --> 08:21.355
Hmm, I wonder who you're trying
to look sexy for?

08:22.324 --> 08:25.092
- Jake, can I borrow
your jacket?

08:25.094 --> 08:26.660
- Yeah, sure.

08:26.662 --> 08:30.130
You still look good
in my jackets, too.

08:30.132 --> 08:33.067
- What do you mean, still?

08:33.069 --> 08:34.034
[Phone chimes]

08:34.036 --> 08:35.602
- Who're you texting, Sadie?

08:35.604 --> 08:38.706
- It's Sergio.
He is such an idiot!

08:38.708 --> 08:40.441
- Oh, my God!
You like him.

08:40.443 --> 08:42.276
- Disgusting!
I do not.

08:42.278 --> 08:44.178
- You totally do.
You laughed,

08:44.180 --> 08:45.612
you only laugh
when you like someone.

08:45.614 --> 08:47.214
That's <i>your</i> tell.
- You only think

08:47.216 --> 08:49.717
I like someone
because <i>you</i> like someone.

08:49.719 --> 08:52.586
Who is it, Lissa?

08:55.357 --> 08:59.660
- Jesus--I love him!

09:07.168 --> 09:08.569
- Hey.

09:08.571 --> 09:11.238
Is Jenna okay?
She won't even talk to me.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.408
I mean, I know my pregnancy
must be hard for her, but--

09:14.410 --> 09:16.443
- your what?

09:17.278 --> 09:18.812
- You didn't know?

09:18.814 --> 09:21.482
Jenna really didn't tell you?

09:21.484 --> 09:22.683
- You're pregnant?

09:22.685 --> 09:24.685
- Matty and I are expecting.

09:24.687 --> 09:25.719
Yes.

09:25.721 --> 09:27.821
Can I tell you a secret?

09:27.823 --> 09:31.325
We're getting married.

09:31.493 --> 09:33.494
- I am shaking,
and it's with anger

09:33.496 --> 09:35.662
and not just the double
dirty chai I just chugged.

09:35.664 --> 09:39.600
How could you not tell me about
the Evaphant in the room?

09:39.602 --> 09:40.401
She's pregnant?

09:40.403 --> 09:42.302
- I'm sorry.
Matty made me promise--

09:42.304 --> 09:44.772
- uh, you mean
the future Mr. Mansfield.

09:44.774 --> 09:47.641
Oh, yeah, he's proposing.

09:47.643 --> 09:48.242
- What?

09:48.244 --> 09:51.712
That's--that's crazy.
I need to find Matty.

09:54.215 --> 09:55.215
Matty.

09:55.217 --> 09:56.183
Matty.

09:56.185 --> 09:59.553
I know it's probably none of my
business, but what the [Bleep]?

09:59.555 --> 10:00.487
You're proposing to her?

10:00.489 --> 10:01.655
- Jenna, we're having a baby.

10:01.657 --> 10:04.792
- Well, my parents had me
when they were our age

10:04.794 --> 10:06.427
and they
didn't get married right away.

10:06.429 --> 10:08.462
Please don't ruin your life
over this.

10:08.464 --> 10:09.630
- "Ruin my life"?
Really?

10:09.632 --> 10:12.533
- And maybe I am overstepping
my bounds, but--

10:12.535 --> 10:13.600
- Jenna, Jenna.

10:13.602 --> 10:17.237
You are definitely
overstepping.

10:19.507 --> 10:20.874
- Okay.

10:20.876 --> 10:22.609
Fine, I'm out.

- Jenna...

10:23.779 --> 10:25.112
- No!
No, no, no,

I have been nothing

10:26.282 --> 10:29.450
but a really,
really good friend to you

10:29.452 --> 10:31.785

10:32.887 --> 10:35.622
I kept your secret.

10:35.624 --> 10:39.293

10:39.661 --> 10:42.596
Good luck, Matty McKibben.

10:44.365 --> 10:46.133
[Door slams]

10:48.937 --> 10:49.937
- It was late, and as usual,

10:49.939 --> 10:52.372
I'd wasted time and energy
worrying about Matty.

10:52.374 --> 10:53.640
It was his life.
Let him worry.

10:53.642 --> 10:56.443
All I cared about was passing
my stats final.

[Cell phone chimes]

11:00.915 --> 11:05.419
Okay, fine, the stats final
wasn't all I cared about.

11:05.421 --> 11:07.421
I cared about Luke, a lot,

11:07.423 --> 11:09.723
and I really wanted him back.

11:09.725 --> 11:11.725
- Listen,...
[Chuckles]

11:11.727 --> 11:14.428
I feel bad about
how we ended things.

11:14.430 --> 11:17.030
You deserve better.

11:17.032 --> 11:20.000
You deserve clarity.

11:20.002 --> 11:23.570
And I'm probably
gonna regret this,

11:23.572 --> 11:24.605
but...

11:24.607 --> 11:27.875
I need to focus on school
right now.

11:27.877 --> 11:29.710
Not on relationships.

11:29.712 --> 11:30.811
I've been working really hard,

11:30.813 --> 11:33.714
trying to keep my head
above water, and...

11:33.716 --> 11:36.517
I can't have distractions.

11:38.686 --> 11:40.554
- But what about the, um,

what was her name?

11:42.892 --> 11:43.524
Babe?

11:43.526 --> 11:46.393
- Oh, Kat.
She calls everybody that.

11:46.395 --> 11:47.361
She's a theater major.

11:47.363 --> 11:50.030
She lives in my dorm,
she likes the same music--

11:50.032 --> 11:53.800
- she just happens to be
really hot.

11:55.803 --> 11:57.538
- Jenna, look--

11:57.540 --> 12:00.574
I really want you in my life.

12:00.576 --> 12:04.411
- Just not as your girlfriend.

12:04.946 --> 12:08.949
- You're such a good person,
you're smart--

12:08.951 --> 12:13.620
- no one cheated, no one yelled,
no one hated each other.

12:13.622 --> 12:16.490

Oh, the faster you get it out,

12:33.576 --> 12:37.978

12:54.663 --> 12:57.698

it, my mom was right.

what I could control.

or Eva, or anything,

13:07.042 --> 13:08.141

You're right.
Only one problem.

13:12.414 --> 13:14.381
I don't understand stats.

to me.

myself to lock Luke in a box.

You were right about her.

Total psycho.

19:32.928 --> 19:34.561
Everything she said was a lie.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.296
- Everything everything?

19:36.298 --> 19:38.932

never was.

Jenna, I'm sorry

You were trying to be
a good friend,

and I was a [Bleep] one.
All year.

Well, it looks like we're both
single again, huh?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.265
- I sure as hell am.

20:12.267 --> 20:15.035
- Yeah. I don't know
if I'll ever be ready

20:15.037 --> 20:16.569
to get back
on that horse.

20:16.571 --> 20:20.940
You know?
What about you?

20:20.942 --> 20:22.242
- Some day.

20:22.244 --> 20:26.346
But for now, I just want
to give it time.
