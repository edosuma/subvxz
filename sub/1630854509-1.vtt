[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

00:13.440 --> 00:14.640
[suspenseful music crescendo]

00:14.720 --> 00:16.400
[thunderous applause and cheering]

00:18.800 --> 00:20.040
Want anything from Wagamama's?

00:20.120 --> 00:21.600
[audience whooping]

00:26.920 --> 00:29.160
[audience whistling and applauding]

00:29.240 --> 00:31.240
[shouts excitedly] Hello, Crawley!

00:31.320 --> 00:32.720
[thunderous applause and cheering]

00:32.800 --> 00:35.080
[suspenseful music continues playing]

00:39.160 --> 00:40.280
Will you include us?

00:40.360 --> 00:42.520
In this, my solo stand-up special?

00:42.600 --> 00:44.760
<i>I wanted my mom to interview me.</i>

00:44.840 --> 00:47.240
Because I'm being honest,
she wasn't even my first choice.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.240
She wouldn't even be
my first-choice Sri Lankan woman over 60.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.960
Crawley is a shithole.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.680
I'm doing an international Netflix special

00:58.760 --> 01:00.280
at your fucking shithole theater

01:00.360 --> 01:01.960
that looks like a disused leisure center,

01:02.040 --> 01:03.840
and nobody gives a fuck.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.120
Are you okay?

01:06.920 --> 01:09.319
[suspenseful music climaxes and fades out]

01:09.400 --> 01:13.320
"I'm sitting here with a comedian
called Romesh Ranganathan."

01:13.400 --> 01:14.680
Who are you talking to now?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.760
Like, do it out to the camera.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.200
-I am Romesh's mom, Shanthi Ranganathan.
-Okay. Do you wanna start from the top?

01:22.280 --> 01:25.120
Well, I'm trying to help you.
You could get a chat show off of this.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
-So, go on.
-[Shanthi] Okay.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.760
I'm Shanthi Ranganathan,

01:29.040 --> 01:30.600
Romesh's mom.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.600
So, I just want to introduce myself first.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.760
"I'm sitting here with a comedian
called Romesh Ranganathan."

01:36.840 --> 01:39.960
"Let's start talking
about Netflix special."

01:40.480 --> 01:42.280
Okay. That's a good intro.
Did you write that?

01:45.360 --> 01:47.600
-Yes. No.
-Okay, that was an insane pause.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.360
-Dinesh.
-Oh, all right. Okay. Go on.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.640
"Let's get to know you."

01:52.560 --> 01:56.360
"What makes you interesting
for the people of Netflix?"

01:56.440 --> 01:57.960
Can you explain that for me?

01:58.040 --> 02:00.000
Uh… Um… I don't know what makes--

02:00.080 --> 02:02.480
What do you mean?
That's not the answer. Ah, ooh, ah…

02:02.560 --> 02:04.320
Just say it properly. What is it?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.280
I don't… Like, what makes me
interesting for the people of Netflix?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.920
-[Shanthi] Yeah.
-I'm not the Tiger King.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.640
I'm doing a stand-up special on there.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.039
[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

02:13.120 --> 02:15.639
-[camera guy] Why are we here today?
-Basically, I…

02:15.720 --> 02:17.800
Leesa, the kids, my mom, my brother,

02:17.880 --> 02:19.880
they don't know that I'm doing this,

02:19.960 --> 02:21.240
that I'm doing a Netflix special.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.120
I just, sort of, think

02:23.640 --> 02:25.560
it'll be a nice thing to announce to them.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.200
<i>I think my mom will be proud and…</i>

02:28.640 --> 02:31.360
<i>Leesa will be proud, I hope.</i>
<i>The kids will be…</i>

02:31.440 --> 02:34.040
My kids very rarely… They don't
give a shit about what I do, really.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.680
So, hopefully,
they'll be, sort of, excited.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.200
I do stand-up comedy.
You know that, don't you?

02:39.280 --> 02:40.400
-[Alex] Yeah.
-[Romesh] Funny.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.800
-Yeah.
-[Romesh] National treasure status.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.360
-Sure.
-[Romesh] Okay. So…

02:44.440 --> 02:45.280
[laughter]

02:45.360 --> 02:47.800
I am doing my tour show.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.560
I'm gonna film it,

02:49.640 --> 02:51.240
and then they're gonna put it on Netflix.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.040
So, what do we have to do?
Will you include us?

02:54.880 --> 02:57.320
-In this, my solo stand-up special?
-[Shanthi] Yeah.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.760
Well, I can put you in the credits.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.320
-This is an opportunity. It's Netflix.
-Put us in the credits.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.640
"Thanks for getting rid
of any excess self-esteem,

03:03.720 --> 03:04.640
Shanthi Ranganathan."

03:04.720 --> 03:05.920
Aw, thanks.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.360
"Thank you for the ongoing anxiety
about choices I've made,

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
Shanthi Ranganathan."

03:09.520 --> 03:10.320
[Romesh laughs]

03:10.400 --> 03:12.960
-[Alex] You're overexaggerating.
-What about the vitamin tablets?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.240
No, you're right, sorry.
You did give me vitamin tablets.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.520
-[Shanthi] There you are. That's what--
-That offsets the years of counselling.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.440
[laughter]

03:19.520 --> 03:21.840
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"At least you ran through the damage."

03:21.920 --> 03:22.720
-Dad.
-[Romesh] Yeah?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.480
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"But a bit of zinc."

03:24.560 --> 03:26.200
[Dinesh laughs] Yeah.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.320
Can I get a fucking bone?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.120
It's, like, going on a worldwide platform.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.840
"Oh, do you think
your mom could get a cameo?"

03:35.920 --> 03:36.800
Why?

03:37.760 --> 03:38.600
Why?

03:39.480 --> 03:43.080
This is the only family where, if you say
that you're doing something, they go…

03:43.160 --> 03:44.720
[in Sri Lankan accent] "What's my part?"

03:45.320 --> 03:47.280
You don't see that in any other specials.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.960
You don't see Chris Rock go…

03:49.040 --> 03:51.240
[imitates Chris Rock]
"Let me introduce to you Mrs. Rock,"

03:51.320 --> 03:53.200
and then she comes out and does a bit.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.440
What are you talking about?

03:55.520 --> 03:58.040
-Well done, though. It's really good news.
-Good job.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.680
-Thank you--
-[Shanthi] That's your wife.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.480
She has to support you,
whether you like it…

04:01.560 --> 04:02.920
She likes it or not.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.880
Mom's attitude towards marriage.
What is that?

04:04.960 --> 04:07.120
Leesa has to support me,
whether she likes it or not?

04:07.200 --> 04:09.760
-Definitely. You're her husband.
-Were you proud of our dad?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.880
-No, but the thing is--
-At the beginning, yes, I was.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.320
Well, how long was that?
Because it wasn't when we were alive.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.000
[all laughing]

04:19.000 --> 04:22.519
[in Sri Lankan accent] "Why the hell
did my life put this asshole into it?"

04:22.600 --> 04:24.480
-Leesa--
-Oh no. Don't get me involved.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.000
When you go for a meal
or when you're at a party,

04:27.079 --> 04:29.840
if your husband starts staring at a woman,

04:29.920 --> 04:31.000
would you like him?

04:31.080 --> 04:32.920
-No.
-[Romesh] This is such a great--

04:33.000 --> 04:36.720
-That… That's what happened to me.
-[Romesh] Great chat about my special.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.240
I knew that you could
bring it into any conversation.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.280
What I didn't anticipate was that I would
talk about doing a Netflix special…

04:43.360 --> 04:45.040
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"Your bloody father!"

04:45.120 --> 04:46.000
[Dinesh laughs loudly]

04:46.080 --> 04:49.280
[in Sri Lankan accent] "Will there be
women? Your father would've loved that."

04:49.360 --> 04:52.760
"If he was sitting in the theater,
I would be here, here, here, here…"

04:52.840 --> 04:53.640
[Alex laughs]

04:54.320 --> 04:55.680
Let's get to the bullet points.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.920
I'm doing a Netflix special.
None of you are in it, okay?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.960
-I just wanna get that established.
-Oh, okay.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
You're rude.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.880
[camera guy] <i>How's it going, Rom?</i>

05:03.960 --> 05:06.040
I thought I was gonna come here,
announce the special,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.360
hug everyone,
there's a lot of love in the room.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.480
Now, what's turned out is,
I've announced the special,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.240
I've left the room not liking anyone
I've left in there, to be honest.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.200
So, Mom,
I was gonna ask you to interview me,

05:16.280 --> 05:19.120
but based on your performance today,
I've got to be honest, I'm in doubts.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.640
The remit of the thing is we're
introducing me to a new audience, right?

05:22.720 --> 05:25.640
So, have a think of a couple
of questions, what you might ask me.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.880
What made you join Netflix?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.840
-Or they invited you--
-I've not joined Netflix.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.480
-[Shanthi laughs] Sorry!
-[Dinesh] When did they offer you the job?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.240
-You are doing the Netflix.
-Yeah. "You are doing the Netflix."

05:35.320 --> 05:37.000
Okay, ask me the question.
Ask the question.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.840
The question was…

05:39.640 --> 05:40.760
I forgot.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.280
-I think… I think it's gonna be great.
-[Dinesh] Great, yeah.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
[Alex groans dejectedly]

05:44.880 --> 05:47.120
-What's your problem?
-[Shanthi laughing]

05:47.760 --> 05:49.960
It's just you two
doing your stupid interview.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.200
-[Romesh] That's what it is, an interview.
-Yeah, but don't do the prep while we--

05:53.280 --> 05:56.440
You can't be in it if you're
just sighing in boredom every time--

05:56.520 --> 05:59.640
-Why can't you do it when we're not here?
-[Romesh] Yeah, I would… You know what?

05:59.720 --> 06:00.760
[Shanthi and Dinesh laugh]

06:00.840 --> 06:02.680
-No, but--
-I bet he wishes you did.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.560
[Dinesh laughs loudly]

06:05.560 --> 06:07.480
Do you watch any
of your dad's programs, darling?

06:07.560 --> 06:09.360
No, Mom says I'm not allowed.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.040
There's too much swearing.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.720
I don't care. My friends watch it.
Why can't I watch my own father?

06:14.800 --> 06:17.040
You don't even wanna watch him
when he's in front of you.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.600
-[Dinesh laughs loudly]
-Why do you wanna watch him on TV?

06:20.400 --> 06:24.760
"Why do you think your brother,
Dinesh, is <i>so </i>much more helpful

06:24.840 --> 06:28.600
and always finds the time to help me out?"

06:28.680 --> 06:30.880
Sometimes I'm just busy
with work and stuff.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.800
Right, as soon as you finish your work,

06:33.320 --> 06:36.840
at least, you can text me,
"Mom, you called. Anything urgent?"

06:36.920 --> 06:38.520
[Romesh] Yeah, and it never is urgent.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.320
Remember, once,
you said, "Call me urgently."

06:40.400 --> 06:42.960
Then I called you, and you said,
"What size trouser are you?"

06:43.040 --> 06:46.720
Because you put on weight.
I just wanted to find out the right size.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.760
-Yeah?
-[Romesh] You… Like…

06:48.840 --> 06:51.800
Like, what's the point?
What is the job of this bit?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.240
What are we trying to do?

06:53.320 --> 06:54.840
To find out about you more.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.480
-Why you're doing a Netflix special…
-Yeah.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.640
And,

06:59.240 --> 07:01.560
little things like that,
just let the public know.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.320
All of the questions
have to follow that mission, yeah?

07:05.400 --> 07:06.560
[Shanthi] Okay.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.320
"Let's dig deeper
into your Netflix special."

07:10.120 --> 07:11.640
"Why are we in Crawley?"

07:12.520 --> 07:14.200
We're in Crawley because--

07:14.280 --> 07:15.120
[Shanthi] Yeah.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.200
-I grew up in Crawley.
-Yeah.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.840
I worked in Crawley,
and I still live in Crawley.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.960
Okay.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.960
So, it's, you know, part of my whole

07:24.680 --> 07:25.480
life.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.120
So, I thought it would be a good thing

07:27.200 --> 07:30.520
to bring the special here
to Crawley, at The Hawth,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.000
my local theater.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.760
What a beautiful answer you have given.
That's made me so happy.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.040
-Good.
-[Shanthi] Are you happy?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.200
Yeah.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.000
What I wanna do now is tell them that,

07:41.560 --> 07:44.920
actually, I've made
the decision of shooting

07:45.480 --> 07:47.120
the special right here.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.280
Not here, but in Crawley, at The Hawth.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.440
The Hawth Theater.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.800
[camera guy] <i>Does it look nice?</i>

07:52.320 --> 07:54.120
[Romesh] <i>From the outside?</i>
<i>No, it's horrendous.</i>

07:54.200 --> 07:55.600
<i>But inside…</i>

07:55.680 --> 07:56.960
[upbeat orchestral music playing]

07:57.040 --> 07:59.640
[Romesh] <i>It's similar to what</i>
<i>the outside suggests, to be honest.</i>

07:59.720 --> 08:02.240
But I wouldn't get any exterior shots,
would be my advice.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.640
[camera guy] I've hired a drone.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.920
Well, I hope it goes high.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.640
Boys, can I have a little,
quick word with you, please?

08:10.720 --> 08:11.560
[Alex] Yeah, sure.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.320
I just wanted to tell you… So, you know
I was telling you about this special?

08:15.400 --> 08:17.240
I'm gonna tell you where it is,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.960
and then I want
your honest reaction, okay?

08:20.040 --> 08:21.800
Basically, I've decided

08:21.880 --> 08:23.360
to do it at…

08:24.720 --> 08:26.640
-Our house.
-[Romesh] No.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.880
The Hawth in Crawley.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.080
Really?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.320
-Wow!
-[Leesa] Here?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.800
-[Romesh] Pardon?
-In Crawley?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.360
-Yeah.
-That's where we're doing our show.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.679
What do you mean,
you're doing your show there?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.039
-[Alex] We are.
-What show?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.960
We're doing dancing and acting,
and stuff like that.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.320
-Not in the big room, where I'm doing it?
-[Leesa] Yeah.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.679
-In the big-boy room.
-[Leesa] Next week.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.080
So, they're doing a kids' show in the
same room that I'm doing the special in?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.640
That's why I was saying to you… I thought
you'd do it somewhere prestigious.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.720
So, I'm gonna walk on
to do my special and think,

08:56.800 --> 08:57.760
"This is the same stage

08:57.840 --> 09:00.400
where such greats as Alex
and Charlie Ranganathan have performed"?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.200
-[Alex] What's wrong with it?
-There's nothing wrong with it.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.680
Are you okay?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.640
-[Romesh] Yeah, I'm fine. It's just…
-You look depressed.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.440
So, the week before I'm doing the special,

09:15.520 --> 09:19.040
my kids are doing
three sold out shows at The Hawth.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.600
<i>For, like, a kids' production.</i>

09:23.640 --> 09:25.200
A kids' production

09:25.880 --> 09:28.600
is doing the same-length run
as my Netflix special.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.480
[violin music plays dramatically
and fades out]

09:30.560 --> 09:32.360
"Let's talk about life on the road."

09:32.440 --> 09:34.160
"Do Leesa and the kids miss you?"

09:34.240 --> 09:35.760
"How do you keep them…"

09:36.280 --> 09:38.080
"Keep the romance alive?"

09:38.160 --> 09:39.960
With Leesa and the kids?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.240
-No, I meant that… Leesa.
-[Romesh] Right.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.000
[Shanthi] "When you are away…"

09:44.080 --> 09:47.280
[laughs] "Have you tried sexy calls?"

09:47.360 --> 09:49.280
-What?
-Sexy calls to your wife.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.080
-[Romesh] Sexy calls?
-Yeah.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.000
Sexy calls to your wife.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.840
-To keep the romance alive.
-[Romesh groans] What is this?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.440
Why do you make sexy calls, son?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.440
Why do you make sexy calls?

10:00.520 --> 10:03.720
I'm gonna be honest, it's the first time
I've heard the phrase "sexy calls."

10:03.800 --> 10:07.520
-What do you mean, "sexy calls"?
-Do you want me to say?

10:07.600 --> 10:08.840
[in breathy voice] "Hi, Leesa."

10:09.360 --> 10:10.680
"What are you wearing today?"

10:11.520 --> 10:12.680
[Shanthi snorts with laughter]

10:12.760 --> 10:13.920
[Shanthi giggles] That's like…

10:14.680 --> 10:17.760
[laughs] "Are you wearing
the underwear I bought you?"

10:19.400 --> 10:20.840
Those are the sexy questions.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.560
Why do I have to tell you?

10:22.640 --> 10:25.840
Are you trying to tell me
you never talk to Leesa

10:25.920 --> 10:27.080
with a sexy voice?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.360
-No.
-[Shanthi] Never?

10:28.440 --> 10:29.240
Never.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.720
Did you ever
speak to Dad with a sexy voice?

10:31.800 --> 10:35.320
I might have done it when I was 20 - 21.

10:35.400 --> 10:39.320
After that, he pissed me off.
So, no sexy calls. No sexy calls.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.880
-So, you did sexy calls with Dad?
-Yeah! Why not?

10:43.400 --> 10:45.160
[Romesh] What did you say?

10:45.240 --> 10:47.000
I can't tell you certain things.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.760
-It's a bit rude.
-"Just got permanent residency."

10:49.840 --> 10:50.640
[Shanthi laughing]

10:50.720 --> 10:52.520
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"You dirty bastard."

10:52.600 --> 10:53.880
[Shanthi giggles] No…

10:53.960 --> 10:57.080
-"Why are you with another woman?"
-[groans in exasperation] Oh my God!

10:57.600 --> 11:00.160
-[upbeat music playing]
-[camera guy] <i>What's the plan for today?</i>

11:00.240 --> 11:01.040
The point of today

11:01.120 --> 11:05.120
is to get a bit of insight into Crawley
and, kind of, its effects on me, I guess.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.000
So,

11:06.080 --> 11:07.840
I picked a few things that we can do.

11:07.920 --> 11:08.720
I'm taking

11:09.240 --> 11:10.120
Din and my mom,

11:10.200 --> 11:14.320
and we're just gonna have a chat
about, kind of, my background, hopefully.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.120
I thought that we could

11:17.160 --> 11:19.240
go to Broadfield, which is, sort of,

11:19.760 --> 11:21.960
where I, kind of,
spent most of my childhood,

11:22.560 --> 11:24.360
on this council estate and…

11:25.040 --> 11:26.600
<i>It would just be nice to, kind of,</i>

11:26.680 --> 11:29.400
<i>talk about our experiences there.</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:33.000
<i>You know, Broadfield, kind of, made me,</i>
<i>even maybe more so than Crawley itself.</i>

11:33.080 --> 11:36.280
This is the house I started my stand-up
career in. No, I didn't start it here.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.680
I started doing stand-up
when I was living here.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.080
I once… I once jumped out…
You know the window out the back?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.360
I jumped out of my room,
and I'd sneak out at whatever time,

11:45.440 --> 11:46.720
and I remember landing on the…

11:46.800 --> 11:47.960
And getting up,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.680
and Dad was staring at me
through the window.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.520
[imitates panicked groan and laughs]

11:52.600 --> 11:54.080
-After shagging a girl?
-[Dinesh sighs]

11:54.160 --> 11:56.560
-Why bring it up every time?
-[Shanthi] I'm trying to find out.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.920
It's bad for me as well,
because I wasn't shagging a girl.

11:59.000 --> 11:59.800
[Dinesh] Yeah.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.640
You wanted me
to be a virgin until I was 37.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.800
Well done. Dream achieved.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.480
[Dinesh] Which he was, for most of it.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.520
-That's why you studied hard.
-The first time didn't really count.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.160
[Dinesh laughs]

12:10.240 --> 12:11.120
Okay.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.880
-[Romesh] What?
-[Shanthi] You've done well.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.600
You were a virgin until you were 37.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.880
[Dinesh snorts with laughter]

12:16.960 --> 12:18.120
[all laughing]

12:18.200 --> 12:19.400
I was joking.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.640
I was 35.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.360
-[Dinesh laughs]
-I'll tell you who wasn't a virgin. Dad.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.960
[all laughing]

12:26.320 --> 12:27.760
[Dinesh snorting with laughter]

12:27.840 --> 12:28.880
[Shanthi] Dad disappeared.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.640
[Romesh] Absolute sauce man.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.600
He had so much sex in his married life,
didn't he? It was incredible, yeah.

12:34.160 --> 12:34.960
And you found--

12:35.040 --> 12:38.200
It's very rare to envy
your dead dad's action levels.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.440
Player!

12:39.520 --> 12:41.720
[all laughing]

12:41.800 --> 12:45.720
You… Both of you were fast asleep,
but I knew where he was going.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.240
Where was he going?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.400
Bewbush.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.400
[groans] Oh God!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.160
-[Dinesh] This is gonna get very specific.
-[Shanthi] I went there.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.160
The woman he fancied… His car was there.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.400
-I turned the car and came back.
-[Dinesh] Didn't wanna get him?

12:58.480 --> 13:01.160
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"Hope you smash it hard. See you later."

13:01.240 --> 13:02.840
[Dinesh and Shanthi laugh]

13:05.240 --> 13:07.360
[Dinesh howls with laughter]
That was a good impression.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.480
-[Shanthi] Anyway…
-[Dinesh] Just Mom at the window…

13:10.560 --> 13:11.720
[all laughing]

13:11.800 --> 13:14.440
[in Sri Lankan accent] "That's the ass
I recognize going up and down.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.680
"Okay. See you. Have fun."

13:15.760 --> 13:17.920
[all laughing]

13:18.000 --> 13:20.760
It was weird. I didn't expect Mom
to talk about how Dad cheated on her.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.520
Why? I was pretending
that I didn't know anything about it.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.160
Mom, you told us every morning on the way
to school. We knew about it, all right?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.600
-It was fine.
-He was missing--

13:28.680 --> 13:31.640
I knew Dad was cheating
before I knew my times tables.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.560
[Dinesh howls with laughter]

13:33.640 --> 13:34.440
Just read the story.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.280
[in Sri Lankan accent] "Before I start,
your dad is a cheating bastard."

13:37.360 --> 13:38.960
[in Sri Lankan accent] "Five times four?"

13:39.040 --> 13:40.640
[all laughing]

13:44.800 --> 13:46.120
-That's the truth.
-[Romesh] Yeah.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.160
-Anyway, but despite all of that--
-[Shanthi] Yeah.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.760
-There are happy memories--
-I suffered.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.360
-I'm struggling to remember them.
-But I made sure you were happy.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.760
-You did.
-[Dinesh] What happened--

13:53.840 --> 13:55.680
-I used to do a lot of overtime.
-[Romesh] Hmm.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.720
-[Dinesh] Yeah.
-And to--

13:56.800 --> 13:58.200
[Romesh] That did make us happy.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.480
You were out.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.200
[all laughing]

14:03.680 --> 14:05.400
[Dinesh] "Can you get
another shift in, Mom?"

14:05.920 --> 14:07.520
God, we're really struggling.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.280
[Dinesh laughs]

14:09.360 --> 14:11.320
-Anyway, I'm glad we've done this.
-[Shanthi] Okay.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.440
[whimsical music playing]

14:12.520 --> 14:15.000
[camera guy]
<i>So, how did it feel to come back here?</i>

14:15.680 --> 14:17.320
I've got pleasant memories here.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
It wasn't like I went back there,
and I went, "Oh my God."

14:19.680 --> 14:22.280
Like, "Thank God
I escaped these streets, you know?"

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
It wasn't like that.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.880
I liked it in Broadfield. It was fun.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.280
You know, your car
got firebombed every now and again.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.040
You'd find weed knocking about.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.120
<i>If you went past the off-license,</i>

14:31.200 --> 14:33.760
<i>a crack addict would demand</i>
<i>that you bought him some cider.</i>

14:33.840 --> 14:34.960
<i>But apart from that,</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:36.200
<i>I loved it there.</i>

14:37.040 --> 14:39.360
Well, next,
we are going to Hazelwick School…

14:41.600 --> 14:43.840
where I was a student,

14:44.520 --> 14:46.800
just after we, kind of,
moved into Broadfield,

14:46.880 --> 14:49.280
and I also went back to be a teacher.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.120
<i>This will be a running theme</i>
<i>where I go back to places, again.</i>

14:52.960 --> 14:54.080
I'm like Jesus.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.720
Is that right? Does that work?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.960
[camera guy] Because he was resurrected?
Don't know if he went to the same places.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.640
He must have done sometimes,

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
if he found a place
he liked for lunch, or whatever.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.960
Carpenters are people of habit,
aren't they?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.320
If they find a good spot,
they will go back there.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.240
I just thought
it would be cool to visit some

15:13.840 --> 15:15.200
key places in Crawley,

15:15.280 --> 15:16.760
because I taught here and went here.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.000
-[Dinesh] Yeah.
-You went here.

15:18.080 --> 15:18.880
[Dinesh] Yeah.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.120
[Romesh] You occasionally
turned up to Parents' Evenings.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.000
[Shanthi] Yeah.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.720
I was what you call "a social chameleon,"

15:24.800 --> 15:28.040
which meant I would kiss any ass,
at any time, to try and look popular.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.720
[in eager child's voice] "Yes,
I like them. Yes, I'm a fan of that."

15:30.800 --> 15:33.080
Well, I had that,
but that's because we were fat kids.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.520
-[Shanthi] Possible.
-[in Sri Lankan accent] "Possible."

15:36.600 --> 15:38.440
[Dinesh laughs loudly]

15:38.520 --> 15:40.320
[Dinesh in Sri Lankan accent]
"It is possible."

15:40.400 --> 15:43.480
[in Sri Lankan accent] "This is the first
thing I agree with. You were fat kids."

15:44.160 --> 15:45.600
"I have…"

15:45.680 --> 15:47.000
"I wasn't enjoying the discussion,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.920
but now there's something
I'm passionate about."

15:49.000 --> 15:51.480
Why did you ask me
to drop you further down?

15:51.560 --> 15:54.600
-Because he was embarrassed of you.
-You were embarrassed about me?

15:54.680 --> 15:58.800
When girls used to phone the house,
and they'd say, "Oh, is Dinesh there?"

15:58.880 --> 16:01.920
Mom would go, "Yeah, hold on one second."
[shrieks in Sri Lankan accent] "Dini!"

16:02.720 --> 16:06.080
[laughs] Oh my God! Why would you do that?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.000
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"Dini, you little virgin,

16:08.520 --> 16:10.120
there's a phone call for you."

16:11.640 --> 16:14.280
"Dinesh, bring your tiny penis down here,
and answer the phone."

16:14.360 --> 16:16.600
-I never said things like that.
-[Dinesh] Did you not?

16:16.680 --> 16:20.200
No! People might think I'm mad.
Using that word… I don't!

16:20.280 --> 16:22.720
I think they might draw
that conclusion just from direct quotes,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.280
rather than me making it seem like it.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.160
Possible, yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.880
What did you think we were like at school?

16:27.760 --> 16:29.400
I had a tough time with you.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.080
When I'd send you to study upstairs,
you'd sit and read a book.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.720
-That's it.
-Oh yeah. What a rebel.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.600
[Shanthi] Yeah.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.440
[Romesh] They said that we can go
to a classroom and chat to the kids.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.280
What's your goal? What's your aim?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.880
Well, just to, sort of, see what
their reaction is to me doing the special.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.360
-[Shanthi] Okay.
-I mean, they might lose their minds.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.680
[jaunty music playing]

16:57.080 --> 16:58.120
-[Romesh] Hi.
-[teacher] Hi!

16:58.200 --> 16:59.640
[Romesh] Hello. Hi. How are you?

16:59.720 --> 17:01.600
-We've got a special guest here.
-[Romesh] Hello.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.760
[Shanthi] Hi, everybody.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.080
-[Romesh] We used to be colleagues.
-Absolutely, yep.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.840
[Shanthi] How was he when he was teaching?
Was he a good teacher?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.920
Well, he was teaching
in the next-door classroom.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.040
Certainly, the kids
were enjoying themselves in there.

17:12.119 --> 17:15.240
-[Shanthi] Yeah…
-Do you want to introduce yourself, then?

17:15.319 --> 17:16.119
[Romesh] Yeah, sure.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.920
I'm Romesh Ranganathan, a comedian.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.160
[Shanthi] I can…
Are you excited to see him, darling?

17:23.920 --> 17:27.480
-Nobody is. I don't mean it in a bad way.
-Oh, there you are.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.760
How does everyone feel
about the special that's coming up?

17:29.839 --> 17:32.400
The Netflix special?
Does anyone know about this?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.280
I'm recording my show at the…
You know the Hawth?

17:36.360 --> 17:38.240
-[students] Yeah.
-Best theater in the country.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.200
-Yeah.
-Yes.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.800
Did anyone go to see <i>Cinderella</i>?

17:41.880 --> 17:44.840
Does anyone remember? Yeah.
Do you remember who the Magic Mirror was?

17:44.920 --> 17:45.880
-Yes!
-[girl] You.

17:45.960 --> 17:46.960
[Dinesh laughs]

17:47.040 --> 17:50.400
-Yeah? Yes, guys!
-[Dinesh] I think… I think she's a plant.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.840
You've got a great future ahead of you,
can I just tell you?

17:52.920 --> 17:54.520
-[girls giggle]
-[Romesh] Thank you, guys.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.440
-Take care--
-[Shanthi] I wish you all the best.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.160
And be happy.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.600
-Love you all.
-[student] Thank you.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.840
-[Romesh] What?
-[Shanthi] Why? I thought you were going.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.000
But I haven't started walking out yet.
You were like, "Peace out," like Elvis.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.040
[boy] I have a question.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.800
You've got a question?
Oh yeah! Sorry. For sure. Let's do it.

18:08.880 --> 18:13.000
Did you ever feel like an outcast
at Hazelwick because of, like,

18:13.080 --> 18:15.840
your ethnicity or your personality,
or anything like that?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.680
-My personality?
-[boy] I don't know.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.440
[all laughing]

18:19.520 --> 18:21.040
You're a very nice man, I'm sure.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.600
I'm sure you're a very nice man.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.960
-I can see why you'd think that.
-Yeah, I must tell you--

18:27.040 --> 18:29.680
-Whoa, whoa. No, no. This is--
-[Shanthi] You were a fat kid.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.360
Remember that?

18:31.880 --> 18:33.680
-Wobbly everywhere.
-Okay, enough. Enough.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.280
Mom, you can't talk like that.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.320
All right, thanks, guys.
Bye-bye! Take care.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.280
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"See you later. Bye-bye!"

18:39.360 --> 18:40.240
"Take care."

18:40.320 --> 18:41.520
"Be happy."

18:42.440 --> 18:45.040
[camera guy] <i>Hold on. Were you</i>
<i>teaching here whilst doing stand-up?</i>

18:45.120 --> 18:48.200
[Romesh] <i>Yeah, I was doing both.</i>
<i>So, I was burning the candle at both ends.</i>

18:48.280 --> 18:49.080
But I still did it.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.400
And I still drove us
to the point of absolute

18:51.920 --> 18:54.520
poverty and destitution
in order to chase that dream.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.200
[laughs]

18:57.280 --> 18:59.840
Even now, I, sort of, think to myself,

18:59.920 --> 19:02.480
"You were doing something
that really made a difference."

19:02.560 --> 19:03.360
"Teaching."

19:03.440 --> 19:06.800
"It's one of the noblest professions,
one of the best things you can do."

19:06.880 --> 19:10.000
And I was, like, on the path
to having a great career, and that.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.520
And I thought, "Do you know what?
This isn't feeding my ego enough."

19:13.600 --> 19:15.640
"I am fed up

19:16.160 --> 19:18.480
with doing stuff that's child-centered."

19:18.560 --> 19:21.000
"How about I do a job that's me-centered?"

19:21.080 --> 19:23.240
"And not only am I gonna do that,

19:23.320 --> 19:25.880
I am going to drive
our income down to the fucking ground

19:25.960 --> 19:27.400
in order to make that happen."

19:28.000 --> 19:29.480
I mean, in that way,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.000
I am one of the worst people I know.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.120
"Can you tell the people at home

19:36.200 --> 19:38.400
about Netflix special?"

19:40.000 --> 19:43.840
Yes, it's a stand-up comedy show.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.440
Stand-up comedy, yeah.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.680
Yeah.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.680
And?

19:47.760 --> 19:48.920
-Well--
-[Shanthi] That's it?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.120
No, I haven't finished.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.160
It's a stand-up comedy show

19:52.240 --> 19:57.880
about my life and my, sort of, concerns
about what's going on in the world.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.480
-It's a good show. You've seen it, right?
-I have seen it, yeah. Okay.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.880
-Can I move on to--
-What's your favorite bit?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.680
[laughs] I can't remember. Can't remember.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.440
-What's any… Just name any bit from it.
-No, I can't.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.760
-[Romesh] You can't?
-No.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.920
Do you know any of the things
I talk about in the show?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.440
No.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.360
-How you became a comedian?
-[Romesh] No.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.280
-Why you became a comedian?
-No.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.880
No, then I can't help you.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.000
I can't tell you.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.280
You watched the show.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.520
-Do you remember anything?
-To be honest with you, I lied to you.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.880
I haven't watched the show.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.840
I've done, like, 200 dates.
You've not watched one of them?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.680
I can't remember.
It happened a long time ago.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.320
[melancholic piano music playing]

20:41.480 --> 20:42.640
[Leesa] Come on, Alex.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.320
[Leesa groans and laughs]

20:44.400 --> 20:46.560
-[Romesh] Right, can I just ask something?
-[Leesa] Hiya.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.680
Yeah, go on.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.520
I don't wanna sound like
I'm being, sort of, arrogant or whatever.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.560
[Leesa] Hmm.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.000
But I thought there would be
a bit more buzz about this…

20:55.800 --> 20:56.600
show.

20:56.680 --> 21:00.600
No one's really mentioned it to me,
if I'm honest. No one's really said…

21:00.680 --> 21:03.040
On the school run and stuff,
no one's said anything to me.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.040
[Romesh] Has anybody
asked for comps, or anything?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.000
[Leesa] No.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.040
-[Alex] Mom, think fast.
-I'm not sure what you expected.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.040
Like, everyone to be, like,
really excited, skipping down the road,

21:13.120 --> 21:15.400
like, "Yay!
Romesh is doing his Netflix special!"

21:15.480 --> 21:17.320
[Alex cheering] Yay!

21:17.400 --> 21:18.760
-[Leesa] Like that.
-[Romesh] Okay.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.760
-[Charlie] Yay!
-Everyone's taking the mickey now.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.600
[Alex] Well, our Stages tickets
are being talked about.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.960
Are you telling me that my special
is getting the same level of hype

21:27.040 --> 21:28.760
as the Stages' musical show?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.120
They could hand some flyers out
to everyone at school.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.080
Yeah.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.280
I'm not handing out flyers.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.520
-Do you not think that's mental?
-We could do it in the morning. And then--

21:39.600 --> 21:42.160
No, no, look… I don't think…
Are you processing what I'm saying?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.440
-[Charlie] No, make--
-I think this is all in your head.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.920
-And I think there is a buzz about it.
-It <i>is </i>all in my head.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.240
-Nobody's bloody talking about it.
-There is buzz about it.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.560
You've not heard
any single person talk about it?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.960
Not to me, but maybe
I should start a conversation.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.240
-Have you heard about Romesh's--
-Okay. Let's roleplay it.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.840
-Imagine I'm at the school gates.
-Okay.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.080
Hello, are you all right? Nice weekend?

22:02.680 --> 22:05.360
-[Charlie] What are you doing?
-Yes, it was a nice weekend, thank you.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.000
-Quite lonely--
-Have you heard Romesh is doing a…?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.240
[laughs] I can't do it.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.280
-You can't even--
-[Charlie] A Netflix special!

22:11.360 --> 22:15.240
A Netflix special at The Hawth,
if you would like to go?

22:15.320 --> 22:16.880
-Isn't Romesh your husband?
-Yeah.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.280
-If you've got no plans--
-[Romesh] So, is he struggling?

22:19.360 --> 22:20.160
No.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.800
What's the show like?

22:21.880 --> 22:24.120
-[Leesa] Yeah, it's really good.
-[Romesh] What's it about?

22:24.200 --> 22:25.400
Um…

22:25.480 --> 22:27.960
-He's been doing it for three years.
-I know.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.200
-And you've only been once?
-I've got three kids, and, you know, it's…

22:31.280 --> 22:32.520
Oh look, here's Charlie.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.320
-Right, must dash. Bye!
-[Alex whines] What?

22:34.400 --> 22:36.480
-You just forgot me.
-[Leesa] Oh sorry, Alex.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.360
Yeah,

22:37.440 --> 22:40.840
you didn't know what was in the show,
and you left one of your children behind.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.120
Nobody seems to know I'm doing it.
I mean, the tickets have gone on sale.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.280
Nobody I talk to knows I'm doing it.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.800
Mom sometimes forgets.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.760
So,

22:52.280 --> 22:54.480
yeah, it's not how
I was hoping it was gonna be.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.840
I… I genuinely…
Look, I'm in a safe space here, okay?

22:57.920 --> 23:01.680
I'm gonna let down the barriers
of my wanting to look, sort of, humble.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.320
Why the fuck
isn't everyone going crazy about this?

23:05.360 --> 23:07.120
Crawley is a shithole.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.680
The Hawth is shit.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.120
I'm doing an international Netflix special

23:11.200 --> 23:12.840
at your fucking shithole theater

23:12.920 --> 23:14.520
that looks like a disused leisure center,

23:14.600 --> 23:16.480
and nobody gives a fuck.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.040
It's mental.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.960
Why are people not out of their houses?

23:21.040 --> 23:23.400
"Oh, isn't that the guy
doing the Netflix special?"

23:23.480 --> 23:26.400
"Hey, Rom. You're doing The Hawth."
Nobody fucking knows.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.800
"Did you enjoy family holidays

23:29.880 --> 23:32.960
we took you on as a child?"

23:33.920 --> 23:36.040
Why… Why are you asking me that?

23:36.120 --> 23:39.080
This is an opportunity
for me to ask that question.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.280
Yeah, but this isn't the only opportunity
for you to ask me that question, is it?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.960
-I mean, you're my mom.
-When did I interview you?

23:45.040 --> 23:48.560
Mom, why can't you ask me about holidays,
like, when we're just at home?

23:48.640 --> 23:52.240
This is, like, a…
Like, they've set up lights, and shit.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.880
"Jesus Christ!"

23:55.000 --> 23:55.960
[laughs]

23:56.040 --> 23:59.680
[laughs] "Did you enjoy
the family holidays

24:00.400 --> 24:02.120
we took you on as a child?"

24:02.200 --> 24:03.040
Yes.

24:03.120 --> 24:03.920
[Shanthi] Thank you.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
"Do you think you're a good brother and--"
-Jesus fucking Christ.

24:08.080 --> 24:13.600
"Would you bring your brother on holiday
if such an opportunity comes?"

24:13.680 --> 24:16.920
[Romesh] What's the deal with the holiday?
This is the second question you've asked--

24:17.000 --> 24:20.280
[Shanthi] You're going on…
You're going to Portugal on holiday.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.200
Yeah.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.920
I would have loved to join you.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.200
But…

24:26.440 --> 24:27.680
you didn't mention anything,

24:27.760 --> 24:29.760
so I'm the sort of person…

24:29.840 --> 24:31.080
I won't ask you.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.960
Can I join you in Portugal?

24:33.040 --> 24:34.760
-[Shanthi sniggers]
-Pardon?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.760
-[Dinesh] Did you speak to Leesa?
-[Shanthi] Yeah.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.280
Mom, is it possible to get Dinesh
a can of "Shut the Fuck Up"?

24:39.360 --> 24:41.720
-[Leesa and Shanthi shriek with laughter]
-[Alex] Hey, Dad.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.000
You're acting like we're not here,
and you're swearing, all willy-nilly.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.160
[Shanthi laughs]

24:46.240 --> 24:49.840
I am in the room,
and you have to respect that.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.200
-[laughter]
-What are you talking about?

24:52.280 --> 24:54.320
Have you two
had a conversation without me?

24:54.400 --> 24:56.280
-Yeah.
-We've had many conversations without you.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.200
No, about--

24:57.280 --> 25:00.440
Moaning about how I've put on weight,
why did I marry a white woman…

25:00.520 --> 25:03.000
-It's not stuff I want to involve you in.
-[Leesa] Yeah.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.520
You had a conversation
about Portugal without me?

25:05.600 --> 25:08.520
I've talked about… I've talked
about us going on holiday to Portugal.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.280
-The five of us are going.
-[Romesh] Yeah.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.280
Do you want your mom
to come to Portugal with us?

25:12.880 --> 25:15.640
-Do I want my mom to come to Portugal?
-That's a good question.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.000
-[Leesa] Yeah.
-Answer Leesa.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.440
-[Dinesh] Remember, she listens.
-Yeah, answer her, Dad.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.480
[Shanthi] Answer her.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
Well, do you want
to come to Portugal with us?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.160
You just asked your mom
to come to Portugal with us.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.680
-[Shanthi] This is how you fool children.
-You invited your mom.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.320
-[Romesh] I've not invited--
-You did!

25:29.400 --> 25:30.560
-[Romesh] When?
-Just now!

25:30.640 --> 25:33.520
-[Romesh] When? What did I say?
-You asked if she wants to come.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
No, no! God, no.
That was hypothetical. I said… No!

25:36.680 --> 25:39.360
[Leesa] If I say, "Yes," you're gonna…

25:39.440 --> 25:41.280
-Jump at the chance, yes.
-Exactly.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.560
[Romesh] It feels like <i>you </i>want this.
I didn't invite her.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.880
Who doesn't want me to come?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.200
-That's what I'm--
-If I say no--

25:46.280 --> 25:47.480
[Romesh] Hold on. Okay, no--

25:47.560 --> 25:49.800
-Right, tell me the truth, Romesh.
-Okay, fine. No, listen.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.400
[Leesa] I think we need to have a chat.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.720
-[Romesh] Why?
-On our own.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.240
-[Shanthi] Yeah.
-What do you mean?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.360
Because you just invited
your mom on holiday with us.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.920
This is the third time
you've said this. I've not once--

25:59.000 --> 26:00.840
If I say no,
I'm gonna upset your mom, aren't I?

26:00.920 --> 26:03.440
Okay. How subtle is it
that you're saying we'll have a separate--

26:03.520 --> 26:05.120
That's why we need this conversation--

26:05.200 --> 26:07.160
[Romesh] And then
I'm gonna come back and go, "No."

26:07.240 --> 26:08.040
What would you…

26:08.120 --> 26:12.120
[in Sri Lankan accent] "I wonder what
happened in that private conversation."

26:12.200 --> 26:14.680
-[Leesa] No, but--
-"It's so difficult to figure it out."

26:15.280 --> 26:16.400
"Leesa must want me,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.760
because she didn't
say anything in front of me."

26:19.560 --> 26:22.480
"And then they got another conversation
separately, and now I'm not going."

26:22.560 --> 26:23.920
[Dinesh laughs and abruptly stops]

26:24.680 --> 26:26.280
I think we should talk about this later.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.760
[Romesh] Yeah, okay. Yeah.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.800
Your Mom's not coming with us.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.480
Why don't you take her away,
just the two of you, later in the year?

26:36.560 --> 26:38.280
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

26:39.040 --> 26:41.680
"What is next for Romesh Ranganathan?"

26:41.760 --> 26:44.240
What's next
is I'm going on holiday to Portugal,

26:44.320 --> 26:45.600
immediately after we record this.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.280
-What a boring thing.
-Well, that is--

26:47.360 --> 26:48.840
Maybe it's excitement for you.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.320
"I'm going on holiday to Portugal."

26:52.040 --> 26:53.240
Thank you, Romi.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.200
-Shall I give you a secret?
-[Romesh] Go on.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.720
I have been to your shows.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.680
I meet all the people who work with you.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.000
They talked about you so high -

27:05.520 --> 27:07.480
how friendly you are,

27:07.560 --> 27:10.360
and you look after them,
and you're nice to them.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.720
As a mother,

27:12.840 --> 27:14.280
I have brought you up nicely.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.720
Made me so proud,

27:16.480 --> 27:17.560
honest to God.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.040
Good. That's another great question.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.720
And what I liked about that question was,
not only did it not require an answer,

27:22.800 --> 27:23.960
it was bigging you up.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.080
It was great. An absolute double whammy.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.360
-Well, thank you very much, Mom.
-Thank you, darling…

27:28.440 --> 27:30.840
-This has been good.
-…for giving me the opportunity.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.840
-So, I enjoyed it thoroughly.
-Yeah, it was great.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.720
[Shanthi] Okay.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.800
And sort of, as a final surprise,

27:36.880 --> 27:41.160
kind of, the icing on this cake that,
if I'm being honest, is made of dog shit,

27:41.800 --> 27:44.920
I've actually organized
for, like, a nice little sign

27:45.480 --> 27:47.920
on The Hawth,
to, kind of, commemorate my return

27:48.000 --> 27:50.280
to The Hawth Theater in Crawley.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.480
[camera guy] What are you
hoping for when they see it?

27:53.560 --> 27:56.320
This is exactly what I'm hoping for.
I'll act it out for you.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.280
So, my mom…

27:57.360 --> 27:58.800
[in Sri Lankan accent] "Romi, what…?"

27:58.880 --> 28:01.440
[grandiose orchestral music playing]

28:01.520 --> 28:02.720
She doesn't have glasses.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.400
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"Romesh Ranganathan is home."

28:07.000 --> 28:08.120
[sobs] "My God…"

28:09.960 --> 28:11.920
"This… You know what this reminds me of?"

28:12.000 --> 28:14.160
"When your father
first fucked his secretary."

28:16.440 --> 28:17.480
Something like that.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.440
[grandiose music continues playing]

28:21.520 --> 28:22.440
So, there you go. Look.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.320
-What do you think?
-[Dinesh] He's home.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.240
[music fades out]

28:26.320 --> 28:28.640
-[Shanthi] You're home?
-He's only gone and gone home.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.000
I'm so excited to see this sign.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.120
[Romesh] What do you mean?
You're seeing it right now.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.440
Some people will think,
"Oh, Romesh is playing The Hawth."

28:36.520 --> 28:38.760
And other people will think,
"He's finally being deported."

28:38.840 --> 28:40.960
-[Dinesh and Shanthi laugh]
-[Romesh] What do you think?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.240
-Is it too much?
-[Dinesh] Mm.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.040
What do you think? You like it?

28:44.120 --> 28:46.400
Well, I asked for it,
and it's up there now.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.000
-So, you can guess my opinion.
-So, why are you asking now?

28:49.080 --> 28:51.600
-It's up there. It's permanent. It's done.
-Why are you asking us?

28:51.680 --> 28:53.960
"What do you think? Is it too much?" What?

28:54.480 --> 28:57.720
Okay, let me start again. Here's the sign.
Couldn't give a shiny shit what you think.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
[Dinesh] Yeah, they spelled it correctly.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.200
-We're good.
-Fine. Let's just forget it.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.600
-I regret you seeing the sign.
-[Shanthi] Don't be like that.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.080
-Be nice to us.
-I show you the sign. "What do you think?"

29:06.160 --> 29:08.600
[in Sri Lankan accent]
"Why didn't you involve us earlier?"

29:09.480 --> 29:12.560
[camera guy] <i>What would a young Romesh</i>
<i>make of where you're at today?</i>

29:12.640 --> 29:14.920
I think he would have been excited,
do you know what I mean?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.960
As a young, sort of, masturbating loner,

29:17.040 --> 29:18.480
I can't imagine

29:18.560 --> 29:20.720
that he ever thought he'd end up being

29:20.800 --> 29:23.360
a comedian returning
to do a Netflix special in his hometown.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.640
I think he'd be excited.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.600
He'd probably go back to the bathroom
and have a second go.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.960
["Rom's Theme" playing]
