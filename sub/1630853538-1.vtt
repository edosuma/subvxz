-with the help of Thy grace...

00:10.836 --> 00:14.666
to sin no more and to avoid
the near occasion of sin.

I firmly resolve to sin no more

00:16.364 --> 00:18.757
and to avoid the near occasion
of sin. [crying]

00:18.801 --> 00:20.324
-Amen.
-Amen.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.326
I absolve you from your sins

00:22.370 --> 00:24.850
in the name of the Father,

00:37.472 --> 00:38.908
It's okay.

I'm sorry.

No, no, no, it's...

02:11.261 --> 02:13.263
-It's my fault.
-I'm so sorry.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.004
-I'm so sorry.
-It's my fault. No.

Help me.

Don't look.

Don't turn.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.552
We're doing this.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.597
We won't talk about it.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.296
We won't mention it, ever.

03:29.339 --> 03:32.081
We won't act on it again.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.778
We can't.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.780
I want you, David.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.957
I want you more
than anyone I've ever wanted.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.830
And I'm not leaving here
until you fuck me.

-Mom!
-Ready, Mom!

04:10.685 --> 04:12.252
-Mom!
-Where's Mom?

04:12.295 --> 04:13.731
-Mom!
-Let us in.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.472
-Mom!
-Will you sign my paper...?

04:15.516 --> 04:16.995
-LAURA: I got her...
-[indistinct chatter]

04:19.389 --> 04:21.609
What's wrong? What did Lexis do?

04:21.652 --> 04:23.219
Nothing. We were just talking.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.655
-Well, she's the favorite child.
-[overlapping chatter]

04:24.699 --> 04:26.135
Okay, shh. I need you

04:26.178 --> 04:27.876
to listen to me for a second.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.312
-But we'll be late.
-Well, then,

04:29.356 --> 04:30.705
Grandma can drive you.
This is important.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.316
-Okay.
-Lexis and I have made a pact.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.362
And we need your help
to make it come true.

04:35.405 --> 04:39.496
Leland Townsend has been
approaching Lexis after school.

04:40.454 --> 04:43.674
None of you look surprised, so
my guess is you knew about this?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.197
[overlapping chatter]

04:45.241 --> 04:46.677
Okay, okay, it's a new day.
It's okay.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.810
I want you all to understand:

04:48.853 --> 04:50.812
this man intends to hurt us.

04:50.855 --> 04:54.337
He's a bad man,
and he's declared a war on us.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.514
And I need the four of you
to work together to stop him.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.734
Now Leland gave Lexis this note.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.649
Do any of you know
what this means?

05:01.692 --> 05:03.694
-LAURA: Daffodil? No.
-LILA: Isn't it a flower, Mom?

05:03.738 --> 05:05.348
-I think it's a...
-I have no idea...

05:05.392 --> 05:08.351
Shh. I'm talking to you
like more mature girls now

05:08.395 --> 05:10.005
because I need you all to be.

05:10.048 --> 05:13.791
Okay? If Leland approaches
Lexis again,

05:13.835 --> 05:16.272
or any of you, you tell me.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.969
Not in a week, not in a day.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.407
You call me that very instant.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.757
Do you understand?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.541
-Yeah.
-KRISTEN: Okay.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.977
Good. Then give me a hug.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
Hey, but we have to be quick.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.241
-[chattering]
-I love you. Now get to school.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.721
-All right. Go, go, go, go.
-[overlapping chatter]

Let's get to school.
I love you all so much.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.724
-So much.
-LILA: Grandma?

05:33.768 --> 05:34.943
-LEXIS: Thank you. Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.075
[footsteps running]

05:37.119 --> 05:39.469
-Mom?
-Yeah?

05:39.513 --> 05:42.646
I might have something for you.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.562
[loud beep,
rhythmic rattling]

05:50.350 --> 05:52.961
Wow. I didn't know
you were this far along.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.963
Yes. We're ready. Tonight.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.618
We keep it
at 43 degrees in here.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.663
Are they looking for money
from the Church?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.186
No. They want a body.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.101
-[beep, door rattling]
-Where's Kristen?

06:03.145 --> 06:05.408
-Thought she'd be here.
-Probably running late.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.410
Getting the girls off to school.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
BEVERLY: Up ahead,
you'll notice the capsule

06:09.456 --> 06:11.327
where the subject's body
will go.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.199
The lab environment is so large
to prevent outside heat

06:14.243 --> 06:16.071
or radiation from interfering
with our results.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
BEN:
It all seems a bit inexact.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.596
It's all thermo-insulated
to eliminate the exchange

06:19.640 --> 06:21.163
of radiant energy
and radiation.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.165
And underneath the capsule--
what's this?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.602
A mass spectrometer,

06:25.646 --> 06:28.344
sensitive down
to one septillionth of a gram.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.868
So you're weighing the body
at the moment of death?

06:30.912 --> 06:32.566
And that'll tell you what?

06:32.609 --> 06:34.872
You believe a human body
just ends at death, correct?

06:34.916 --> 06:36.396
-BEN: Yup.
-Then, in theory,

06:36.439 --> 06:37.658
there should be no loss
of mass or energy

06:37.701 --> 06:38.746
when a person dies.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.964
The first law of thermodynamics:

06:40.008 --> 06:41.313
the body should weigh the same

06:41.357 --> 06:42.619
immediately after death
as before.

06:42.663 --> 06:43.664
Well, except for an exhalation

06:43.707 --> 06:45.013
of breath and other fluids.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.536
Feces, urine.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.277
But they'll all
be trapped in this container,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.931
and weighed before
and after death.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.150
My experiment is about the loss
of mass or energy

06:52.194 --> 06:53.543
that
there is no explanation for.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.024
You want to measure
for the soul?

06:56.067 --> 06:58.200
BEVERLY:
I am not a religious person.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.723
You call it a soul,

06:59.767 --> 07:02.726
but I am measuring for...
consciousness.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.207
If there is a loss of
body weight when a person dies,

07:05.250 --> 07:06.556
what is it?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.732
What does it weigh?
Where does it go?

07:08.776 --> 07:10.908
Hmm. And if it weighs the same?

07:11.953 --> 07:14.521
Then there's nothing else
to discuss.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.653
There is nothing after death.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.877
BEN:
In 1901, a physician

07:22.920 --> 07:25.445
named Duncan MacDougall
conducted an experiment

07:25.488 --> 07:28.056
into the weight of the...

07:28.099 --> 07:29.623
soul.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.757
He conducted an experiment
with dying subjects

07:33.801 --> 07:35.498
and weighed them
before and after death.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.501
He found a difference
of 21 grams.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.722
And has this experiment
been retried since?

07:41.765 --> 07:43.463
-BEN: No.
-KORECKI: Why not?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.856
BEN: It was seen
as scientifically unserious.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.597
KORECKI:
Because it was about the soul?

07:47.641 --> 07:49.730
No. Because science doesn't
have a religious agenda.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.514
DAVID: If it doesn't have
a religious agenda, then

07:51.558 --> 07:53.603
why doesn't it try
to replicate the experiment?

07:53.647 --> 07:56.258
Because you're trying
to use science as a crutch.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.434
You're trying to use it to prove
there's life after death.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.175
DAVID: No, but why isn't it
treated the same way

08:00.218 --> 08:01.524
-as quantum physics?
-Quantum physics?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.047
It doesn't have
a religious agenda.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.701
It's not trying
to prove there's religion.

08:04.745 --> 08:05.876
-All right, all right, stop.
-Yes, but that's why...

08:05.920 --> 08:07.835
Stop. This Dr. Swan--

08:07.878 --> 08:09.401
she doesn't want money from us?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.012
No. She-she wants people
who are dying.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
[door opens]

08:13.623 --> 08:15.799
[footsteps approaching]

08:16.844 --> 08:18.802
Don't stop on my account.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.891
Go ahead, David.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.459
I have, uh... I don't have
anything else to say.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.418
Well, there is a priest
in hospice care.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.986
He has ASPS, a very rare cancer.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.554
The doctors say
he has 24 hours to live.

08:31.598 --> 08:36.516
I talked to him about this
experiment, and he volunteered.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.909
Thoughts?

08:38.953 --> 08:40.607
[Leland clears throat]

08:40.650 --> 08:44.306
Let me try to clear
the air here, if you don't mind,

08:44.349 --> 08:46.047
-Your Eminence.
-Please.

08:46.090 --> 08:49.224
David, I know that you and I got
off on the wrong foot,

08:49.267 --> 08:50.617
but I've been asked
by the cardinal

08:50.660 --> 08:52.444
to look over your shoulder

08:52.488 --> 08:54.534
for issues of liability.

08:54.577 --> 08:58.363
Liability is a cross
we all have to bear.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.892
Hi.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.808
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-KORECKI: That's perfectly fine.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.680
We've been discussing
this soul scale experiment.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.377
LELAND: And the need
for a signed release

09:12.421 --> 09:13.901
from the participating priest.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.599
Yes, Ms. Bouchard?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.601
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.169
Would you mind backing up
a few feet?

09:21.212 --> 09:23.519
[Leland laughs]

09:27.654 --> 09:29.612
-What is this?
-A restraining order.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.614
You've been served.

09:31.658 --> 09:36.010
Monsignor, can't we settle
our disagreements

09:36.053 --> 09:37.881
without these
ad hominem attacks?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.230
Ms. Bouchard,
this is not necessary.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.797
Oh, it's not a restraining order
for me.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.234
I can take care of myself.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.714
It's for
my 11-year-old daughter.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.587
-Excuse me?
-KRISTEN: Mr. Townsend

09:47.630 --> 09:48.979
has approached my daughter
at school

09:49.023 --> 09:50.590
on four separate occasions,

09:50.633 --> 09:52.069
and he's asked her
to keep it a secret from me.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.723
No, this is...

09:53.767 --> 09:55.551
And he's also made her
uncomfortable with his touch.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.640
I did not. What are you
talking about? This is insane.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.164
Luckily, one of my daughters
took a photo,

10:00.208 --> 10:03.472
and that is why the court
granted me this injunction.

10:03.515 --> 10:07.345
That... that is
a misinterpretation.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.825
Well, I guess it's a good thing

10:08.869 --> 10:10.305
that the Catholic Church
has no issues

10:10.348 --> 10:11.698
with older men
touching children.

for a second.

No, this is...
this is a lie, Your Eminence.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.271
-This is just...
-Like you said, Leland,

-You okay?
-Yeah.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.154
Is everything all right
with Lexis?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.547
We're getting back on track.

And everything else?

10:40.683 --> 10:42.250
Yeah, we're good.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.035
Good.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.302
Ms. Bouchard, I've asked Leland

10:51.346 --> 10:53.348
to take a step back
until we can investigate.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.461
-Hi. How are you?
-Good.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.811
-You're home early.
-Yeah, I wanted to...

23:41.855 --> 23:44.205
-Well, where were you guys?
-Uh, upstairs watching TV.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.337
Why are the locks changed?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.383
Mom was worried
about someone harassing Lexis.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.778
What?

23:51.821 --> 23:53.475
-[indistinct chatter]
-What happened?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.651
We're trying
to figure that out.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.524
I'm not dead! [laughs]

23:58.567 --> 24:00.874
Okay, maybe
we should get you off there.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.353
-Come on. Come on.
-Oh.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.486
Mwah.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.707
I always wanted to do that,

24:07.750 --> 24:10.710
and now I have. [laughs]

24:10.753 --> 24:12.799
[loud chewing]

24:12.842 --> 24:14.496
Let's put that down, please.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.237
No. I'm hungry.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.065
What happened?

24:18.108 --> 24:20.502
I don't know, but he was
medically dead for 56 seconds,

24:20.546 --> 24:21.851
with a loss of 24 grams.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.549
His soul left his body?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.551
No, he's still 24 grams lighter.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.249
Uh, so he's walking around
without a soul?

24:28.292 --> 24:30.120
Well, obviously,
he can't be without a soul,

24:30.164 --> 24:32.209
because there he is.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.647
What are you all
whispering about?

24:34.690 --> 24:37.476
Just happy to have you back.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.042
Ah.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.044
There's obviously a malfunction
in your system.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.263
-Mm-mm.
-Okay, the explosion,

24:42.306 --> 24:43.612
the lights out there.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.136
No.
We need a greater sample size.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.618
I'm a medical mystery. [laughs]

24:49.662 --> 24:51.141
-ANDY: So what is this?
-LAURA: Candy salad.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.360
-It's really healthy.
-LYNN: You got to try it.

24:52.403 --> 24:53.709
-Come on.
-No, no, no, no.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.189
-Yeah, you know you want to.
-Airplane!

24:55.232 --> 24:56.669
-Oh! Okay, okay.
-Yummy!

24:56.712 --> 24:58.105
-Yeah!
-Mmm.

24:58.148 --> 24:59.672
-It's so good, right?
-So, listen.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.151
How is your grandmother
these days?

25:01.195 --> 25:03.327
Mm. Rad-G? She's good.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.808
Rad-G? Is there anything weird
about her?

25:05.852 --> 25:07.506
-Okay, this is awful!
-No, it's not.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.116
-You're crazy. This stuff is...
-Try another bite.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.987
-We do. Yeah.
-I know. I know.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.424
Where is Lexis?
Oh, this is truly awful.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.383
You need to build a kitchen,
too.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.863
Don't use all your lumber.

25:16.906 --> 25:19.605
-Do you have a kitchen, Pollie?
-I do.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.171
And I will show it to you.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.912
I'm just arguing with my mom.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.524
She's so mean!
Is your mom mean?

25:25.567 --> 25:27.177
Dad's looking for you.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.657
What are you doing
on Lynn's bed?

25:28.701 --> 25:31.530
-Playing.
-Let me see.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.053
No.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.055
My mom's mean. Is yours?

25:35.098 --> 25:37.579
LAURA:
Who's that?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.755
-Leland.
-What?

25:39.799 --> 25:42.236
Leland. He's trying to trick me

25:42.279 --> 25:43.629
into thinking
he's a little girl.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.718
My mom keeps nagging me.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.589
How do you know?

25:47.633 --> 25:50.766
He keeps on asking about Mom,
and he doesn't type like a girl.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.289
-Lynda?
-LAURA: Well, then,

25:52.333 --> 25:53.682
-you shouldn't be...
-Lynda?

25:53.726 --> 25:55.423
Wait. Then what are you doing?

25:55.466 --> 25:57.686
-Pretending to be tricked.
-Why?

25:57.730 --> 25:59.906
I want to know
what he wants to know.

25:59.949 --> 26:03.431
-Then I'll tell Mom.
-Lynda, are you still there?

26:03.474 --> 26:06.434
My mom's mean. Is yours?

26:06.477 --> 26:08.828
[laughs]
I want to do it, too.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.482
-You're too young.
-I'm not.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.572
Okay, get your iPad.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.666
[laughing]:
Well, look who's home.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.232
Yup.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.671
Did Kristen know
you were coming home tonight?

26:25.714 --> 26:27.760
Nope.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.676
Did you say good night
to the girls at least?

26:30.719 --> 26:33.026
-Yup.
-[laughs]

26:33.069 --> 26:35.594
Well, you're a font
of information, aren't you?

26:35.637 --> 26:38.684
Yeah, and, uh,
I'm home permanently,

26:38.727 --> 26:41.991
so, uh, I want you out of the
garage by the end of the week.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.994
[laughs]

26:45.038 --> 26:47.040
Have you talked to your wife?

26:47.083 --> 26:49.259
I'm home, Sheryl,

26:49.303 --> 26:51.697
and, uh, I don't like
what you do to my house.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.916
I don't know what you're about,

26:53.960 --> 26:55.483
with your little voodoo dolls,

26:55.526 --> 26:56.963
-and your...
-Ooh.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.660
-[laughs]
-And all your stuff.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.140
But I don't want it
near my family,

27:00.183 --> 27:01.707
so I want you out
by the end of the week.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.360
You're an ungrateful asshole.
Do you know that?

27:03.404 --> 27:04.797
Yes, I do.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.277
I've suspended my life
to babysit for free.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.757
I've put everything on hold...

27:08.801 --> 27:10.411
Congratulations.
Now I want you out.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.412
Shut the fuck up.

27:11.455 --> 27:12.631
-How dare you?
-Yes.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.676
How dare I?
How dare I be a husband?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.417
Your time to be a husband
was a year ago.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.853
No, no, no. Listen, Sheryl,
it doesn't work anymore.

27:17.897 --> 27:21.683
Okay? The guilt trips,
the nasty comments.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.077
Do I look affected by it?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.079
Now get the fuck out
of my house.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.736
-Listen, Daddy.
-[scoffs]

27:30.779 --> 27:32.738
You don't want
to get on my bad side.

27:32.781 --> 27:36.002
Oh, my God, you have a bad side?

27:39.875 --> 27:42.008
You're on.

27:46.273 --> 27:49.015
Eddie, my Eddie,
give me the clarity and wisdom

27:49.058 --> 27:52.279
to know how
to stop this goddamn,

27:52.322 --> 27:54.890
cocksucking piece
of motherfucking shit.

27:54.934 --> 27:57.719
Oh. Oh, my God.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.940
Help me. Help me, help me.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.072
Help me, God.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.903
What am I doing? [sighs]

28:07.947 --> 28:10.036
Help me, God.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.780
Help me to see you when I die.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.477
David.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.307
[loud whispering]:
No! Kristen, we said once. No.

28:20.350 --> 28:23.614
But I didn't mean it,
and you didn't, either.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.748
[sighs]
Oh. This is insane.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.272
The way you fucked me
last night.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.797
The way we came together.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.408
-[moans]
-[sputters]

28:34.451 --> 28:36.062
-We can't keep doing this.
-[moans]

28:36.105 --> 28:39.152
Sure we can.
It's just you and me.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.545
Kiss me.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.071
KRISTEN:
Mmm.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.203
[both moaning]

28:51.730 --> 28:53.557
-Ah.
-What the fuck?

28:53.601 --> 28:55.908
-What?
-Your tongue.

28:55.951 --> 28:59.955
Oh. Yeah, I just got it done.
Do you like it?

28:59.999 --> 29:01.957
You're... you're not...

29:02.001 --> 29:03.742
Who are you?

29:03.785 --> 29:06.396
Kristen. Feel my breasts.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.225
Mmm. Feel how wet I am.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.837
-Oh, my God. What are you?
-Mmm.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.362
Does it matter?
I can feel how hard you are.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.146
[both gasping]

29:17.190 --> 29:20.323
[moaning]

29:29.289 --> 29:31.030
So you're home now?

29:31.073 --> 29:33.336
Mm-hmm. Forever.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.861
No more business?

29:35.904 --> 29:38.341
Well, I got a buyer. Bash.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.996
-Good.
-Yeah.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.694
I want to use the money
to add onto the house.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.696
Yeah, yeah, the girls said.
A bathroom?

29:45.740 --> 29:47.655
Yeah, and one more bedroom.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.135
Can we afford it?

29:50.832 --> 29:53.574
We will. I promise.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.839
And one more thing.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.929
I want your mother gone.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.020
I know you do.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.589
[Kristen sighs heavily]

30:09.720 --> 30:11.418
I agree.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.428
It's all good.
Thank you. Thank you.

30:21.471 --> 30:22.733
Go see Sister Gertrude.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.213
I'm fine.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.998
Oh.

30:26.041 --> 30:28.304
What? Matt's not with you?

30:28.348 --> 30:30.437
-Matt?
-H-His Eminence.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.875
Oh, uh, no. He-he wanted us
to see you first.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.965
Oh, well, sit down. [laughs]

30:37.009 --> 30:38.967
I'm making him nervous.

30:39.011 --> 30:43.232
I mean, I spent my whole life
not saying what I thought,

30:43.276 --> 30:47.019
and now, suddenly,
I want to say it all.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.195
Do you remember
what happened in the chamber?

30:50.152 --> 30:52.372
Well, I remember being alone.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.069
KRISTEN:
Uh-huh.

30:54.113 --> 30:57.377
And reaching out my hand,
and-and... and Matt's voice.

30:57.420 --> 31:01.120
I remember that.
He said, "Let God take you."

31:01.163 --> 31:03.122
And then?

31:03.165 --> 31:05.515
Then I saw something.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.344
People in a room.

31:08.388 --> 31:12.435
They were smiling at each other,
they were reaching out.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.785
And their arms were really long,

31:14.829 --> 31:16.962
and they were stretching out
toward me.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.660
And I was starting
to move toward them.

31:19.703 --> 31:22.619
But it was suddenly
such a long distance.

31:22.663 --> 31:25.187
[chuckling]: I thought
it was across a room,

31:25.231 --> 31:28.147
but it seemed to be miles.

31:28.190 --> 31:32.194
And then,
I felt something on my back.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.196
I think a hand.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.633
It was Matt's hand,

31:36.677 --> 31:39.549
and he was smiling at me,

31:39.593 --> 31:42.291
so I turned...

31:42.335 --> 31:45.077
Then I was alive again.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.993
[laughs]

31:48.036 --> 31:50.647
So, I have no soul, right?

31:50.691 --> 31:53.085
-[David laughs]
-I can't say that.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.044
Tell Matt to come see me.
Please.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.052
Medically?

32:04.096 --> 32:08.317
So, the mass in his lungs--
the ASPS-- has disappeared.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.407
And the cancer
in his lymph nodes is shrinking.

32:11.451 --> 32:15.063
So, how do we explain this?

32:15.107 --> 32:17.152
A miracle.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.677
What was he like
before he got sick?

32:20.721 --> 32:23.028
Nothing like this.

32:23.071 --> 32:26.509
He was serious and-and intense.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.859
-DAVID: Hmm.
-He would never...

32:28.903 --> 32:30.861
Kiss you?

32:30.905 --> 32:32.515
Yes.

32:33.777 --> 32:36.824
He said he felt your hand
on his back

32:36.867 --> 32:38.826
and saw you smile,

32:38.869 --> 32:41.611
and that's why he decided
to come back to his body.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.439
How do we explain
the continued loss

32:43.483 --> 32:45.702
of the-the weight?

32:45.746 --> 32:47.530
BEN: Yeah, the-the sensors.
They malfunctioned.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.880
Dr. Swan would like
to do the experiment again.

32:49.924 --> 32:52.840
-With Father Ignatius?
-No, with a new patient.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.016
Okay. I'll talk to hospice.

32:55.060 --> 32:59.064
We have a nun, Sister Gertrude,
who's in her last days.

32:59.107 --> 33:01.153
[footsteps departing]

33:02.850 --> 33:04.939
Yes?

33:04.983 --> 33:07.420
I think you should go see him.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.074
He's asked for you.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.076
I will. When I can.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.382
I want him to recover first.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.345
Uh, do you have a minute?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.521
Yeah, I do.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.439
-Maybe we should...
-Yeah, I think so.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.442
[David sighs]

33:34.142 --> 33:35.578
-So...
-[sighs]

33:35.622 --> 33:37.058
...about the other night, um...

33:37.102 --> 33:39.408
Look, we-we don't have
to talk about it.

33:39.452 --> 33:42.237
-I was in the wrong.
-You-you weren't.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.717
I was just as involved.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.024
You stopped us.
That's the most important thing.

33:48.678 --> 33:52.334
What do you mean, I stopped us?

33:52.378 --> 33:56.208
I-I just think
it's best to move on, you know?

33:56.251 --> 33:58.036
Kristen, are you...
