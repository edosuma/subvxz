WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.500
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.713 --> 00:05.749
Derek, I can't take it anymore.

00:07.592 --> 00:10.083
Sacrificial blood. We're in a Nemeâ€™ron.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.126
- What's happening to me?
- I don't know.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.086
Why don't you just
come back with me?

00:14.265 --> 00:17.098
You, Lydia, you're just
a girl who knew too much.

00:17.268 --> 00:21.352
It a Druid went down the wrong path,
there's a Gaelic word for that as well, Darach.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.434
Dad?

00:45.671 --> 00:49.584
Okay, all medications
should be sealed inside the plastic bags,

00:49.800 --> 00:51.586
and the patients carry it in their hands.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.758
When you've completely
evacuated the room,

00:53.971 --> 00:55.802
you mark the door with a red "X," okay?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.381
What the hell is going on?

00:59.644 --> 01:01.600
The weather called for mild
thunderstorms this morning.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.975
And now they're saying
power is already out in several towns.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.525
Hill Valley's under a flood watch.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.436
| live in Hill Valley.

01:09.028 --> 01:10.438
Are your patients clear?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.652
Uh,

01:13.449 --> 01:14.859
all except for Cora Hale.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.419
Hey, anyone want to tell me when they're
getting my niece out of here?

01:29.632 --> 01:31.372
Sorry, but she wasn't, uh...

01:36.889 --> 01:38.174
You're supposed to be dead.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.225
| get that a lot actually.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.115
Derek?

01:56.993 --> 01:58.949
- Derek, where are you?
- Right here.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.238
Thank God.

02:08.504 --> 02:11.962
Something happened at the recital.
At the school.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.835
Okay, I need to tell you before you hear it,

02:14.051 --> 02:16.133
before you hear any of it from them.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.670
- From who?
- Scott, Stiles.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.220
They're gonna tell you things.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.264
Things you can't believe.
You have to trust me, okay?

02:22.435 --> 02:24.175
- You trust me.
- What is it?

02:24.395 --> 02:26.226
Promise you'll listen to me.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.104
I promise.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.985
They're already here, aren't they?

02:50.254 --> 02:53.496
So, they told you it was me?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.206
That I'm the one taking people?

02:55.426 --> 02:57.587
We told him you're the one killing people.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.302
Oh, that's right.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.972
Committing human sacrifices?
What, cutting their throats?

03:04.185 --> 03:06.096
Yeah, I probably do it on my lunch hour.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.135
That way, I can get back
to teaching high school English

03:08.314 --> 03:09.520
the rest of the day.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.097
That makes perfect sense.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.106
Where's my dad?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.108
How should I know?

03:18.115 --> 03:21.107
Derek, tell me you don't believe this.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.205
Do you know what happened
to Stiles's father?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.452
No.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.284
Ask her why she almost killed Lydia.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.088
Lydia Martin?

03:33.255 --> 03:35.962
- I don't know anything about that.
- What do you know?

03:36.175 --> 03:39.793
I know that these boys,
for whatever misguided reason,

03:40.012 --> 03:42.389
are filling your head with an absurd story.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.680
And one they can't prove, by the way.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.141
What if we can?

03:48.187 --> 03:49.267
What is that?

03:50.231 --> 03:53.644
My boss told me it's a poison and a cure,

03:54.735 --> 03:57.647
which means you can use it

03:57.863 --> 03:59.774
and it can be used against you.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.114
Mistletoe?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.841
Derek, wait, wait!

04:21.762 --> 04:22.797
You need me.

04:23.013 --> 04:23.968
What are you?

04:24.181 --> 04:26.263
The only person who can save your sister.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.342
Call Peter. Call him!

04:30.688 --> 04:32.804
It's not good.
She's in and out of consciousness.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.186
She's vomiting up black blood
along with one other alarming substance.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.941
Mistletoe.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.564
How did you know that?

04:44.243 --> 04:46.029
Derek. Derek, what are you doing?

04:46.245 --> 04:48.736
Her life, it's in my hands!

04:52.626 --> 04:54.127
Stop. Derek, stop!

04:55.045 --> 04:57.536
Stilinski, you'll never find him.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.377
Derek.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.423
Derek!

05:09.185 --> 05:10.925
That's right.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.057
You need me.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.181
All of you.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.742
You should know I'm not
doing this because I have to.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.112
I want to.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.123
I could still run,

06:16.335 --> 06:19.327
and you wouldn't have
an easy time stopping me.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.461
But I don't want your sister to die.

06:22.675 --> 06:24.256
I'm only doing what I had to do.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.674
Shut up.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.961
You need to hear the whole story, Derek.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.216
You need to knowjust how
connected we really are.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.389
Stop talking.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.097
I don't know,
something feels wrong about this.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.941
You know, we proved it to Derek,

06:43.153 --> 06:45.405
but she still had this look
like it didn't matter.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.940
You know, like it was all
still going according to plan.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.946
You saw it, didn't you?

07:04.758 --> 07:05.793
What's that?

07:06.010 --> 07:07.921
Well, you got claws. I got a bat.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.892
Scott! Scott!

07:18.272 --> 07:20.684
What are you doing here?
The hospital's evacuating.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.144
- We're here for Cora.
- What, all of you?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.861
Why does Stiles have my bat?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.561
Mom, just trust me on this.
You need to get out of here.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.447
Right now.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.652
The building is supposed
to be clear in 30 minutes.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.658
We've got two ambulances
that are coming back.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.284
One's 10 minutes out, the other's 20.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.952
Cora needs to be on one of those.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.455
They'll be picking up
in the basement garage.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.922
- Got it.
- Okay.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.102
You don't have to keep me
on a leash, Derek. I'm going to help.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.217
Derek.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.731
We got a problem.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.188
Big problem.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.695
Help me.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.989
Ethan, Aiden, stop!

09:40.205 --> 09:41.866
You don't know what you're doing.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.906
All we want is her.

09:49.173 --> 09:52.415
Okay, everybody,
let's evacuate this way and stay calm!

09:52.634 --> 09:53.714
You guys good?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.134
Good... Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.469
Don't stop, don't stop!

10:41.934 --> 10:43.049
Stiles!

11:11.130 --> 11:13.587
I can't get a hold of Derek or Scott.
How's Lydia?

11:13.757 --> 11:14.963
She's got bruising on her neck.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.415
They're taking her to a hospital downtown

11:16.635 --> 11:18.136
because Beacon Memorial
is being evacuated.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.677
- The storm's that bad?
- It will be.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.338
And I overheard an EMT
saying the backup generators

11:22.558 --> 11:24.423
might be too old to last
if the power goes out.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.300
Beacon Memorial.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.428
- That's where Cora is, right?
- I'm taking the two of you home.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.481
No, l have to get to the hospital.
I can't leave Cora there with just Peter.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.476
Isaac.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.441
l'll drive.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.132
Thank you, Ms. McCall.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.545
You're him, aren't you?

12:03.182 --> 12:04.592
Him?

12:05.017 --> 12:06.223
The bad guy.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.058
You have no idea.

12:17.863 --> 12:18.943
You hesitated.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.896
I pulled back. There's a difference.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.856
They're protecting her.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.658
- They don't have a choice!
- Neither do we!

12:25.871 --> 12:28.157
If all these sacrifices,
all these bodies piling up,

12:28.373 --> 12:31.115
if it's actually giving her
the power to get rid of us,

12:31.335 --> 12:34.122
then we need to take
any chance we can to get rid of her.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.137
- Where's the big guy?
- He's close.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.350
What about Ms. Blake?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.305
What do you mean?
What does that mean? Like, she's gone?

12:54.524 --> 12:55.980
- Scott, are you kidding me?
- Shh, quiet.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.730
Me be quiet? Me, huh?
Are you telling me what to do now?

12:58.904 --> 13:00.610
When your psychotic,
mass murdering girlfriend,

13:00.906 --> 13:03.147
the second one you've dated,
by the way, has got my dad

13:03.325 --> 13:05.316
somewhere, tied up, waiting
to be ritually sacrificed?

13:05.535 --> 13:06.945
Stiles, they're still out there.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.027
And... And they want her, right?

13:09.248 --> 13:10.988
Which means now we don't have her either,

13:11.208 --> 13:12.948
so my dad and Cora are both dead!

13:13.168 --> 13:14.704
Not yet.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.254
Is she really dying?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.002
She's definitely not getting any better.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.133
There has to be something that we can do.
We have to help her.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.639
You can't.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.092
Only I can.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.011
I can save her,

13:34.231 --> 13:36.062
and I can tell you where Sheriff Stilinski is.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.729
But there is a pack of Alphas
in this hospital who want me dead.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.436
So I'll help you,

13:42.656 --> 13:45.022
but only when I'm out of here and safe.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.783
Only then.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.413
- Derek, wait!
- She was trying to get out.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.912
l was trying to keep from getting killed.
You can't blame me for that.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.172
If you want to show
you're one of the good guys, then heal her.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.916
Not until I'm safe.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.752
I'd like to
volunteer a different method of persuasion.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.795
- Let's torture her.
- Works for me.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.507
Um, can I have your attention?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.392
Mr. Deucalion...

14:14.604 --> 14:18.267
Excuse me, just Deucalion,

14:18.483 --> 14:21.941
requests you bring the woman
calling herself Jennifer Blake

14:22.154 --> 14:23.940
to the ER. reception.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.363
Do this, and everyone else can leave.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.940
You have 10 minutes.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.950
- He's not gonna hurt her.
- Shut up.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.281
He won't!

14:36.168 --> 14:38.204
Scott, you know why.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.706
Tell them it's true.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.880
What does she mean?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.966
You're not the only one
he wants in his pack.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.314
- Looks like the evacuation's over.
- Are you catching a scent?

15:06.156 --> 15:08.112
No, not with the rain this heavy.

15:10.494 --> 15:14.203
Deucalion doesn'tjust want an Alpha pack.
He wants perfection.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.081
That means adding the rarest
of Alphas to his ranks.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.283
A true Alpha.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.121
What's that?

15:24.758 --> 15:27.625
The kind that doesn't have
to steal his power from another.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.091
One that can rise
by the force of his own will.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.095
Our little Scott.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.354
It doesn't matter.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.936
We still need to get her out of here.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.653
- Scott, your mom...
- My mom

15:45.862 --> 15:47.944
said there's one more
ambulance coming in 20 minutes.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.943
And I don't think we've been here that long,
so if we can get down to the garage,

15:51.159 --> 15:52.945
get to the last ambulance,
we can get out of here.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.406
The twins aren't gonna
let us just walk out.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.571
- l'll distract them.
- You mean fight them.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.531
Whatever I have to do.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.370
I'll help you.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.453
Um, sorry, but I'm not going
anywhere without you, Derek.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.132
I'll do it.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.466
But I'd prefer to be out
there with an advantage.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.135
An advantage like what?
You mean like a weapon?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.137
Something better than a baseball bat.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.720
Hey, wait. What about these?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.266
- Do you know how to use those?
- Well, no.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.770
Put 'em down.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.237
That's only gonna make him stronger.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.907
How strong?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.422
All right, boys. Let's rumble.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.122
It's still here!

17:32.677 --> 17:34.133
Derek, over here.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.519
Julia.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.786
It is you.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.539
You can't beat her on your own.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.462
That's why we're gonna run.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.217
Wait, wait! The elevator!

18:44.666 --> 18:46.156
Thank you.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.116
That was more than helpful.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.368
What now? What do you want with me?

18:51.089 --> 18:52.499
You?

18:53.008 --> 18:55.795
You're my gesture of goodwill.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.134
What?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.130
Go find your son.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.439
Do yourself a favor, Melissa.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.810
Be careful out there.

19:15.572 --> 19:20.111
Okay, okay, okay. We're okay.
We're all right. You okay? How you doing?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.947
Why do you look like you're not breathing?

19:27.459 --> 19:29.575
Because you aren't breathing, are you?

19:29.794 --> 19:32.661
Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.
Why are you not breathing? Come on.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.962
Okay, okay, okay.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.548
You can do this. Here we go, tilt the head.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.101
Fingers on the chin. Clear the throat.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.646
Great, nothing. I see nothing.
Okay, all right, so, uh...

19:51.858 --> 19:55.646
Just pinch the nose and blow.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.941
Oh, come on, Cora.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.985
Come on, Cora.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.243
If you're thinking service hatch,

20:13.463 --> 20:15.954
they bolt from the outside,
so you'd have to break it.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.755
All you'd end up doing is
creating a lot of noise,

20:17.967 --> 20:18.956
telling them exactly where we are.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.257
Kali already knows.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.043
Not necessarily. She saw that we got in,

20:22.263 --> 20:23.844
but she might not know
that we didn't get out.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.218
Yeah, well, if I get through,
then we can go to another floor.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.726
Or you'd end up fighting them alone
in an elevator shaft.

20:30.271 --> 20:34.014
They'll rip my head off before you even
have a chance to land a punch.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.480
Then someone needs
to get the backup generator running again.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.478
Come on.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.190
Oh, come on, Cora.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.111
Come on, breathe.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.285
Come on, Cora, breathe.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.075
Oh!

21:00.051 --> 21:01.882
You know,
next time I put my lips to your mouth,

21:02.095 --> 21:04.211
you better be awake.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.675
That shot didn't last very long.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.858
Those twins are really starting
to piss me off.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.738
How the hell are we
supposed to get past them?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.946
Personally, I think if we keep letting them
beat the living crap out of us,

21:31.166 --> 21:32.997
they'll tire and give up.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.805
You couldn't have waited, like, 10 seconds?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.428
They didn't get out, did they?

22:01.488 --> 22:03.319
"Don't move. On our way."

22:11.456 --> 22:13.697
You just hold on a little longer, okay?

22:14.751 --> 22:17.743
Trust me, if anyone's
gonna get us out of this, it's Scott.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.130
Can't believe I just said that.

22:24.052 --> 22:27.044
You know,
I actually used to be the one with the plan.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.515
Well, or at least a plan B.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.018
Now I don't know.
Now I'm thinking maybe you were right.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.646
You know, maybe...
Maybe we are pretty much useless.

22:39.901 --> 22:43.359
Maybe all we really do is
show up and find the bodies.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.116
I don't want to find my father's body.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.913
You know, you're a lot easier to talk to
when you're completely unconscious.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.120
I'm gonna take that
as a sign you're a little worried.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.582
Stay close to me.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.711
I think I heard something.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.167
Where?

23:51.431 --> 23:53.262
Below us.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.622
Stiles! Stiles, open the door!

24:27.842 --> 24:28.957
Sorry.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.963
Help me get him in.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.886
Where's Derek and Jennifer?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.884
l have to go back for them and my mom.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.599
Okay, two problems.
Kali's got the keys to this thing,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.188
and ljust saw the twins,
like, 30 seconds ago.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.147
Stay here.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.133
Where is she?

25:13.179 --> 25:14.919
We're trying not to hurt you.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.879
- Try harder.
- Hey!

25:17.892 --> 25:19.348
I'd like to try something.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.734
Sweetheart, get up!

25:31.322 --> 25:32.562
Come on.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.905
Anything?

25:48.172 --> 25:51.255
Derek, I know what you're thinking.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.844
That I'm using you,

25:54.053 --> 25:57.966
that everything that has
happened between us is a lie,

25:58.182 --> 25:59.888
or that I'm evil.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.100
A bitch.

26:04.272 --> 26:07.059
But I hope you're not thinking

26:07.275 --> 26:09.561
the most superficial thought.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.110
"Is that her real face?

26:14.824 --> 26:18.908
"The slashed, mutilated face
revealed by the mistletoe.

26:21.122 --> 26:23.659
"Is that what she really looks like?"

26:25.793 --> 26:27.954
You should have kept his mother.

26:28.171 --> 26:29.957
Is that so?

26:30.173 --> 26:32.960
You have a soft spot for him.

26:33.176 --> 26:36.134
l have an investment I'm trying to mature.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.671
If you want to talk about soft spots,

26:39.891 --> 26:42.052
let's talk about Jennifer Blake.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.138
Or... What was her name again?

26:48.232 --> 26:49.267
Julia.

26:49.650 --> 26:50.776
Ah.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.395
Julia Baccari.

26:53.946 --> 26:54.935
That was my name.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.817
I don't care.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.944
I guess I should have
changed it to something

26:59.160 --> 27:01.025
with different first letters.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.327
I think | read somewhere
that people always pick aliases

27:03.539 --> 27:07.123
that are subconsciously derivative
of their original name.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.952
It's a way of not completely
letting go of your identity,

27:11.172 --> 27:14.130
since your name is so tied
to your sense of self.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.208
Do you know what else is?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.137
Your face.

27:24.685 --> 27:29.270
The one that's supposed
to be staring back at you in the mirror.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.892
Not some hacked up atrocity
you can't even recognize.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.898
I still don't care.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.196
But I bet you're curious.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.944
I bet you wonder exactly what happened.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.570
You were an emissary.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.153
They tried killing you along
with the rest of the pack.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.238
Mystery solved.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.665
l was Kali's emissary.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.047
And l was the one she couldn't kill.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.153
I didn't understand
why I had to kill her too.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.574
She was harmless.

28:26.164 --> 28:29.122
But I did it because you wanted me to.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.326
I did everything you asked
to be a part of this pack.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.162
You did it to be with Ennis,

28:36.382 --> 28:39.715
so don't point that accusing toe at me.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.508
And as for harmless,

28:41.721 --> 28:43.586
how harmless does she look now?

28:44.182 --> 28:45.922
I thought she was dead.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.932
Did you?

28:52.148 --> 28:54.560
Are you asking

28:54.775 --> 28:57.312
if maybe there was
a moment of uncertainty?

28:58.446 --> 29:00.562
That when I walked away
thinking she was dead,

29:00.781 --> 29:02.396
that maybe I turned back?

29:03.451 --> 29:06.739
And maybe I saw her there,
lying perfectly still,

29:06.954 --> 29:09.411
but I focused my hearing anyway.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.248
Listened to the sound
of her heart still beating,

29:15.129 --> 29:18.246
still fighting for life, and I thought,

29:18.466 --> 29:21.333
"I could go back and finish it,

29:21.552 --> 29:24.885
"or I could let someone I love
die peacefully."

29:27.308 --> 29:29.424
And maybe I just kept walking.

29:32.980 --> 29:36.097
My heart bleeds for you, Kali.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.439
Apparently hers
could have bled a little more.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.367
For years,
the Nemeton's power was virtually gone,

29:50.331 --> 29:53.289
like the dying ember of a burned out fire.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.831
But a few months earlier,

29:58.047 --> 29:59.958
something happened

30:00.174 --> 30:03.712
that caused that ember
to glow a little brighter.

30:07.682 --> 30:11.345
Something that gave it
a spark of power again.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.645
The sacrifice of a virgin.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.026
You didn't know
what you were doing back then,

30:30.246 --> 30:32.953
but killing Paige in the root cellar,

30:33.165 --> 30:37.909
sacrificing her there,
gave power to the Nemeton.

30:38.629 --> 30:41.120
You gave it power again.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.874
YOU gave me power.

30:45.428 --> 30:49.387
Just enough to hold on to life a little longer.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.884
Long enough to be found.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.066
She's still breathing.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.190
He just let me go,
said it was a gesture of goodwill.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.983
No other reason.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.824
He had to have a reason.

31:13.998 --> 31:16.284
I don't think he does anything
without a reason.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.957
Well, if that means
I should continue to be profoundly terrified,

31:19.170 --> 31:22.128
then don't worry about it,
I got that covered.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.226
You know mistletoe is important to Druids,

31:45.446 --> 31:49.109
but do you know the myth
of why people kiss under mistletoe?

31:50.659 --> 31:51.944
No.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.117
It's a Norse myth.

31:54.455 --> 31:58.698
Balder, the son of Odin,
was the most beloved by the other Gods,

31:59.502 --> 32:01.868
so much that they wanted to protect him

32:02.129 --> 32:04.245
from all the dangers in the world.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.883
His mother, Frigg, took an oath

32:09.053 --> 32:12.716
from fire and water, metal,
stone, and every living thing,

32:12.932 --> 32:15.139
that they would never hurt Balder.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.551
At a gathering, they tested him.

32:19.313 --> 32:24.103
Stones, arrows, and flame
were all hurled at him.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.104
Nothing worked.

32:26.445 --> 32:30.313
But there was one God
who wasn't so enamored of Balder.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.115
The God of mischief, Loki.

32:33.786 --> 32:38.155
Loki discovered that
Frigg had forgotten to ask mistletoe,

32:38.374 --> 32:42.868
a tiny, seemingly harmless plant,

32:43.045 --> 32:45.206
and completely overlooked.

32:46.048 --> 32:50.132
Loki fashioned a dart out of mistletoe,
and it killed Balder.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.554
Frigg was heartbroken.

32:52.763 --> 32:56.802
She decreed that mistletoe
would never again be used as a weapon

32:57.017 --> 33:00.680
and that she would
place a kiss on anyone who passed under it.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.354
So now we hang mistletoe
underneath our door

33:03.566 --> 33:05.352
during the holidays

33:07.361 --> 33:10.524
so that we will never
overlook it again.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.993
We were the overlooked,

33:17.204 --> 33:18.990
the emissaries.

33:19.874 --> 33:22.206
It was a mistake Deucalion and the Alphas

33:22.418 --> 33:23.999
should never have made,

33:24.170 --> 33:26.456
because I made an oath of my own.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.296
From virgins and warriors,

33:29.592 --> 33:34.006
from healers, philosophers, and guardians,

33:34.180 --> 33:37.513
to loan me their power
so that I could teach these monsters

33:37.725 --> 33:40.933
that their monstrous actions
would never be overlooked.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.061
- You killed innocent people.
- So have you.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.227
I know the real color
of your eyes, Derek.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.100
And I know what it means.

33:52.406 --> 33:55.569
I'm not asking you
to save just my life.

33:56.327 --> 34:01.117
I'm asking you
to save everyone they'll ever hurt again.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.115
You can't beat them.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.955
Are you sure about that?

34:09.673 --> 34:11.254
Boyd asked you right before he died,

34:11.425 --> 34:14.167
what happens to a werewolf
during a lunar eclipse?

34:14.386 --> 34:17.253
You didn't get the chance to tell him,

34:17.473 --> 34:19.509
but you know, don't you?

34:20.184 --> 34:22.140
What happens, Derek?

34:23.187 --> 34:26.771
During the total lunar eclipse?

34:28.150 --> 34:30.106
We lose all our power.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.279
- So then they're essentially trapped?
- Yeah, right.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.736
There's no way of getting them out
without turning the power back on.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.412
But wait, wait, wait, if the power's back on,

34:43.582 --> 34:45.083
they're gonna hear
the elevator moving, right?

34:45.251 --> 34:47.207
And they'll be on Jennifer
and Derek as soon as it stops.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.289
We can't get in a fight with them.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.004
- You've got us now.
- It's too much to risk.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.835
They want her dead, and if she dies,

34:54.051 --> 34:56.337
there's nothing that we can do
for Stiles's dad or Cora.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.468
I don't even think! know
which teacher this is.

34:58.681 --> 35:01.388
She's... She's the one with the brown hair.
She's kind of hot.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.051
No, it's... Just an observation.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.943
What are they doing?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.656
Plotting.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.877
- You ready?
- Yeah.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.758
You're not nervous, are you?

35:41.974 --> 35:43.339
Do I look nervous?

35:44.184 --> 35:45.720
No, not at all.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.606
- Did he look nervous?
- Terrified.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.807
Yeah, I can still hear you,
very, very clearly.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.605
Just go as soon as you see them, okay?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.486
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

36:01.869 --> 36:03.325
I don't think they're on this floor.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.793
Come on. Oh, God.

37:18.946 --> 37:22.154
Derek, please look at me.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.866
All right, come on, come on, come on!

37:34.044 --> 37:36.126
- I got her.
- Okay, get the door.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.681
Stiles, let's go!

37:55.774 --> 37:57.184
Stiles!

38:11.915 --> 38:13.200
Mom.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.290
Scott! Scott, wait!

38:24.344 --> 38:27.552
- Come on, we gotta go. Drive, you idiot.
- I can't. Not without Scott.

38:28.724 --> 38:31.716
Come on, you want the Argents dead too?
Make a choice!

38:32.770 --> 38:34.726
Oh, for the love of God! Go, now!

38:35.230 --> 38:36.811
All right!

38:50.162 --> 38:52.528
Mom! Mom!

38:57.795 --> 38:59.751
Guardians, Scott.

39:01.507 --> 39:04.419
If you were with me,
I could've told you what it meant.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.417
I could've warned you.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.257
Let me help you, Scott.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.922
Let's help each other.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.721
You help me catch her,

39:14.937 --> 39:18.350
and I'll help you
get your mother and Stiles's father back.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.449
Scott.

39:37.835 --> 39:39.666
Scott, don't do this. Don't go with him.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.453
I don't know what else to do.

39:43.632 --> 39:45.122
No, there's...

39:45.342 --> 39:47.003
Scott, there's got to
be something else, okay?

39:47.219 --> 39:50.006
We always... We always have a plan B.

39:54.184 --> 39:55.640
Not this time.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.725
Scott.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.106
I'm gonna find your dad.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.151
I promise.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.154
Scott!

40:34.182 --> 40:36.468
Hey. Hey.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.975
You all right?

40:40.606 --> 40:42.562
Oh, God, where are we?

40:43.025 --> 40:44.515
I don't know.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.103
Looks like a root cellar to me,

40:49.907 --> 40:51.863
but, uh, she called it something different.

40:54.411 --> 40:56.367
She called it a

40:57.789 --> 40:59.404
Nemeton.
