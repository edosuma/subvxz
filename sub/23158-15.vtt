02:53.819 --> 02:58.777
Carissimi amici, a certi momenti,
e una vera Madonna,

02:58.825 --> 03:01.530
e poi, subito dopo, diventa una strega.

03:03.287 --> 03:05.826
E una combinazione molto interessante.

03:06.583 --> 03:10.450
Vogliamo vedere un po'
chi e in questo momento.

04:04.852 --> 04:09.561
Venite qui micetti,
Maria ha della buona carne per voil

04:14.153 --> 04:16.478
Benjerno...

04:18.533 --> 04:20.241
Dove andiamo ?

04:33.549 --> 04:35.007
Polizia !

05:04.372 --> 05:08.121
Katrina. Robin Masters sent me.

05:08.168 --> 05:09.995
Robin ?

05:10.045 --> 05:13.746
We have a jet waiting at Messina.
I'm taking you out of here.

05:18.053 --> 05:19.631
Nuzo.

05:56.302 --> 05:58.971
Maria, arrivano questi dolci ?

06:03.476 --> 06:06.049
In un sacco, capito ?

06:35.926 --> 06:37.586
Maria ?

07:02.037 --> 07:05.821
Marchese, scusate.
Ora lo prendiamo e vediamo chie.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.513
"Polonius' bond of friendship
for musicians."

07:46.983 --> 07:49.023
Five letters and four letters.

07:53.448 --> 07:57.197
Steel... band.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.197
Of course.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.330
"Pope's great queen, note...

08:07.505 --> 08:10.505
"uplifted by a sound of praise."

08:10.550 --> 08:12.008
Seven letters.

08:12.051 --> 08:15.302
- Buongiorno.
- No, that's nine letters.

08:15.346 --> 08:17.802
It's a glorious morning.

08:18.850 --> 08:20.926
Yes. Quite.

08:22.812 --> 08:26.597
- Would you like some brunch ?
- Please, I'm famished.

08:28.401 --> 08:32.897
- How do I get down ?
- There's a staircase just behind you.

08:36.202 --> 08:38.360
Zeus, Apollo, patrol.

08:52.552 --> 08:57.973
- Prosciutto and melon. May I have a bite ?
- Yes. Of course.

08:59.059 --> 09:01.680
I'll have the cook prepare
whatever you wish.

09:01.728 --> 09:04.480
Fine. Where is my hero ?

09:04.522 --> 09:08.307
Well, if you mean Magnum,
seeing the sun's barely over the yardarm,

09:08.360 --> 09:11.646
I'd say he's good
for another three hours in bed.

09:14.867 --> 09:19.410
- Are you sure ?
- Absolutely. I'm fine. Really.

09:32.426 --> 09:34.965
Higgie, you're just as I remember you.

09:35.013 --> 09:38.382
Are you still the finest lawn croquet player
in the Pacific ?

09:39.809 --> 09:43.427
I've heard of a chap down in Guam
who's supposed to be pretty good.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.306
And chess ?

09:45.357 --> 09:50.434
I remember sitting in that living room
watching you trounce both Papa and Robin.

09:52.823 --> 09:56.406
It made him so angry,
being beaten by a servant.

10:01.415 --> 10:04.915
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that like it sounded.

10:05.795 --> 10:09.959
It's quite all right. I am a servant, in a sense.

10:11.092 --> 10:13.761
May I have that breakfast now ?

10:13.803 --> 10:17.635
Yes, of course. What would you like ?

10:17.682 --> 10:22.143
Coffee, toast and butter, bacon and eggs.
Over easy, I think.

10:22.187 --> 10:24.975
Some fresh-squeezed orange...

10:25.023 --> 10:29.484
No, wait. I'm in Hawaii.
Make that fresh pineapple juice.

10:29.528 --> 10:33.775
And some of this delicious prosciutto
and melon. And a double of everything.

10:33.824 --> 10:36.066
- Double ?
- Of everything.

10:37.244 --> 10:39.570
All right.

11:57.077 --> 11:58.786
Margo.

12:04.002 --> 12:06.077
Tough night ?

12:08.131 --> 12:10.004
Very.

12:12.009 --> 12:15.095
She's not still around, is she ?

12:16.639 --> 12:20.684
I would hate to have some woman
who's into men wearing Lash LaRue outfits

12:20.727 --> 12:22.554
pop out of the little girl's room.

12:22.604 --> 12:25.225
- No chance.
- Good.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.734
You see, I'm a little confused.
Maybe you could help me.

12:32.614 --> 12:34.691
I'd love to try.

12:34.742 --> 12:40.496
Well, I met this rather attractive man.

12:41.332 --> 12:44.951
We went through the usual mating dance
for a week or two

12:45.002 --> 12:47.375
and... he was pressing kind of hard.

12:49.007 --> 12:53.337
And then, I finally decide
that he's really a straight shooter.

12:53.386 --> 12:56.755
So when he invites me
to fly to Maui for the weekend...

12:59.684 --> 13:02.092
It's Saturday morning.

13:02.146 --> 13:03.770
Try Sunday afternoon.

13:05.232 --> 13:07.640
Sunday afternoon ?

13:07.693 --> 13:10.729
- No, I left a message with Rick.
- Rick ?

13:11.572 --> 13:15.901
Yeah. Well... actually I left it
with his service, see ?

13:15.952 --> 13:17.991
I didn't have much time.

13:19.079 --> 13:20.574
You didn't get the message.

13:20.623 --> 13:25.202
Do you think I would have spent most
of Friday night at the airport if I had ?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.663
Oh, Margo.

13:29.716 --> 13:32.123
Oh, Margo, I'm sorry.

13:33.261 --> 13:37.555
Look, Rick's service
must have messed up the message.

13:37.599 --> 13:42.641
- But it was an emergency. Honest.
- Oh. What kind of emergency ?

13:42.687 --> 13:44.396
Well...

13:50.696 --> 13:53.650
- You're not gonna believe me.
- No, try me.

13:55.993 --> 14:02.162
Well, see, Robin asked me to rescue
the daughter of a friend of his

14:02.208 --> 14:05.957
from the clutches of this Sicilian Marchese.

14:06.004 --> 14:08.542
So he flew me to Sicily in his private jet.

14:08.590 --> 14:13.585
And the reason that I dressed in black,
see, I had to sneak into the villa

14:13.637 --> 14:15.131
and it was a full moon.

14:15.180 --> 14:21.349
And it all worked out, I got the girl out.
And I got back here last night. Only...

14:23.480 --> 14:26.186
I'm working on a 16-hour jet lag

14:26.233 --> 14:30.979
and I did not know what day it was
until you just told me.

14:34.742 --> 14:36.616
And that's the truth.

14:41.749 --> 14:44.370
You know something ?

14:47.839 --> 14:50.081
I believe you.

14:51.176 --> 14:53.215
You do ?

14:54.012 --> 14:55.720
Margo.

14:56.598 --> 14:58.970
Thomas, darling. Are you up yet ?

14:59.017 --> 15:02.221
Ah. Correction, almost believed you.

15:02.271 --> 15:05.023
I've brought us the most fantastic brunch.

15:08.194 --> 15:10.102
Oh...

15:10.154 --> 15:12.989
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

15:13.032 --> 15:16.781
- Have a nice Sunday, Thomas.
- No, wait. Margo.

15:16.827 --> 15:19.117
Come on. Wait a minute.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.584
Margo, come on.

15:23.626 --> 15:26.747
This is the girl. Let me explain.

15:26.796 --> 15:29.917
It would take a 1930s movie to explain this.

15:29.966 --> 15:33.252
And I bear absolutely no resemblance
to Myrna Loy.

15:39.184 --> 15:44.392
What the hell are you doing,
coming in here dressed like that, anyway ?

15:44.440 --> 15:47.357
I wanted to do something nice for you.

15:50.237 --> 15:51.613
I'm sorry.

15:53.533 --> 15:58.195
Oh, hey. No, it's my fault.

15:58.246 --> 16:02.030
What you're doing was very thoughtful.
I'm sorry.

16:03.627 --> 16:08.123
I'm just such a grouch in the morning,
before I've had my coffee.

16:08.172 --> 16:12.586
- It's afternoon.
- No wonder I'm such a bear.

16:14.012 --> 16:18.093
I ordered the eggs over easy.
I hope that's the way you like them.

16:18.141 --> 16:20.218
Over easy's perfect.

16:22.354 --> 16:27.941
I would have ordered espresso,
but I didn't know if you liked it for breakfast.

16:47.922 --> 16:50.709
- Ma cos'e, questa schifezza ? I
- Com'e ?

16:50.759 --> 16:52.716
Ma t'assicuro che non e un espresso !

16:52.761 --> 16:55.513
The Marchese don't like your espresso.

16:55.555 --> 16:57.465
Sorry. I'll take it back.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.307
He says don't bother.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.055
Are you all right ?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.369
Yeah.

17:29.247 --> 17:32.996
But you ought to warn a guy
if you're gonna sleep on his steps.

17:33.043 --> 17:36.625
I didn't want to wake you,
so I was waiting out here.

17:36.672 --> 17:40.005
- I guess I dozed off.
- No guess.

17:44.722 --> 17:49.016
Anyway, the doctor said
that I'd be catnapping for a few days.

17:49.059 --> 17:51.515
- When did you see a doctor ?
- This morning.

17:51.562 --> 17:54.729
Higgie insisted
that I have a complete physical.

17:56.025 --> 17:58.942
- Higgie ?
- Oh, well...

17:58.987 --> 18:02.936
I guess I shouldn't call him that.
It's just that he's so cute.

18:03.950 --> 18:08.198
I thought we'd play a little tennis
and then have a late lunch on the beach.

18:08.246 --> 18:11.995
- It's so beautiful down there.
- What, you and Higgie ?

18:12.042 --> 18:14.330
No. You and I.

18:16.671 --> 18:21.298
Katrina, look, I've got to go into Honolulu
and run a couple of errands.

18:21.343 --> 18:24.297
Well, we can play tennis any time.

18:24.347 --> 18:27.098
And a late lunch in town would be fun.

18:29.184 --> 18:31.307
I already have plans for lunch.

18:34.857 --> 18:36.980
I've done it again, haven't I ?

18:39.195 --> 18:44.023
Look, I would love to take you to lunch
or to dinner or just about anywhere.

18:44.075 --> 18:48.903
I'd just like to ask first. Or at least be asked.

18:48.955 --> 18:52.823
Of course. You're right. Perfectly right.

18:52.876 --> 18:59.674
Higgins said that you usually lie about
all day doing nothing, so I just assumed...

18:59.717 --> 19:03.715
Well, you tell Higgie
that today I had something to do.

19:14.023 --> 19:18.104
How about lunch tomorrow ?
I know a good sushi bar if you like raw fish.

19:18.152 --> 19:20.441
- That's a date.
- OK.

19:38.131 --> 19:42.461
'Other than being presumptive, Katrina
seemed a warm, beautiful, young woman

19:42.511 --> 19:44.718
'who just wanted to spend time with me.

19:44.763 --> 19:48.381
'So, of course,
I was off to mend fences with Margo,

19:48.434 --> 19:51.389
'who didn't care if she ever saw me again.

19:51.437 --> 19:55.435
'You ever wonder why we always
chase those things that are hardest to get ? '

20:15.296 --> 20:19.294
- This your car ?
- This one ?

20:19.341 --> 20:22.675
- Why, you like it ?
- I just love it.

20:24.388 --> 20:27.555
'Somehow,
I knew what she was going to say next.'

20:29.560 --> 20:32.514
I'd give just about anything to ride in one.

20:39.112 --> 20:43.524
How's it ?
Can you tell me where the physics lab is ?

20:47.871 --> 20:51.122
After last night,
I never want to see him again.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.625
Never.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.124
- Are you sure ?
- Positive.

20:56.213 --> 21:01.290
It was over before it really began, anyway.
And it was never what we had.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.381
- I love you.
- I know you do.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.508
And I love you, too.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.834
- Very good, John.
- Thank you, Miss Perina.

21:33.878 --> 21:38.706
Now, it doesn't matter what you draw upon
to help you play a scene.

21:38.757 --> 21:43.171
As long as it puts you in touch
with an emotion that you can use.

21:48.309 --> 21:52.556
For example, the anger I felt
in the scene with John was real.

21:52.605 --> 21:56.057
I drew from something
that happened to me this weekend.

21:56.109 --> 21:59.478
If nothing else,
acting can be a wonderful catharsis.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.697
OK, tomorrow we're back on improvisation.

22:04.743 --> 22:08.788
There's a wonderful little drama playing
at the Kahala Community theatre.

22:08.830 --> 22:12.959
I recommend it to all of you,
especially since it's free.

22:34.608 --> 22:37.561
Did you really dump all your anger
in that scene ?

22:37.611 --> 22:40.730
- Not all of it.
- Oh.

22:40.781 --> 22:46.534
Well, maybe if you played part of it again
with me, you'd get rid of the rest of it.

22:47.955 --> 22:51.288
- Which part of it ?
- I don't know. I was thinking...

22:52.335 --> 22:54.457
Well...

22:56.046 --> 22:58.039
The kiss ?

22:59.342 --> 23:02.627
If that's what you think would be best.

23:08.101 --> 23:11.350
OK, Thomas. One more chance.

23:11.396 --> 23:15.857
But no stories about rescuing a beautiful
damsel from some villainous count.

23:15.900 --> 23:18.855
Marchese. The Marchese di Como in Sicily.

23:20.530 --> 23:23.485
Margo, would you rather I lied ?

23:24.535 --> 23:26.443
- No.
- Good.

23:26.495 --> 23:29.330
- I'll tell you the story after lunch.
- Where ?

23:29.373 --> 23:32.659
How about the infamous retreat
of the Marchese di Magnum ?

23:38.090 --> 23:40.213
Thanks. I found the...

23:43.971 --> 23:45.799
How did you do that ?

23:48.977 --> 23:51.682
I didn't. Hey !

23:52.731 --> 23:56.680
I don't suppose you know
anything about this scratch on my car ?

24:00.905 --> 24:05.200
Bro, I'd bust your chops for making
eyes at my girl, but I'd never do that.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.904
It's not nice.

24:06.953 --> 24:10.157
Shamoo's not lying.
We've been studying since you saw us.

24:10.207 --> 24:13.291
You didn't see anything ?

24:13.336 --> 24:15.957
Sorry, bro. It was a nice car.

24:18.716 --> 24:19.996
Thanks.

25:08.517 --> 25:10.557
What do you think ?

25:11.395 --> 25:14.396
I don't think a little spit is going to fix that.

25:17.819 --> 25:21.104
I tell you what,
why don't you go on to the guesthouse ?

25:21.155 --> 25:24.073
I'm gonna find Higgins
and break the news to him.

25:24.116 --> 25:26.193
You sure you want to do that ?

25:26.244 --> 25:29.529
Well, the car was parked.
I wasn't anywhere near it.

25:29.581 --> 25:32.618
It's not my fault.
Higgins will understand that.

25:33.585 --> 25:37.204
- You irresponsible cretin !
- Higgins, it wasn't my fault.

25:37.255 --> 25:40.589
It's never your fault.
Yet Mr. Masters' property always ends up

25:40.634 --> 25:44.050
- looking like it's been salvaged from a bin.
- It's just a scratch.

25:44.096 --> 25:48.509
If it was, you'd have tried to rub it out with
spit, or something equally disgusting.

25:48.559 --> 25:50.136
No, I wouldn't.

25:57.985 --> 26:00.476
Oh, my God !

26:00.529 --> 26:05.655
- This isn't a scratch, it's a bloody gouge.
- No. Actually, a gouge is a lot deeper.

26:05.702 --> 26:10.743
I've seen cars come through four years
in the Blitz looking better than this.

26:12.626 --> 26:15.959
I know you saved Miss Tremaine
from a fate worse than death...

26:16.004 --> 26:19.788
Well, not quite, since she spent
three months in a splendid villa.

26:19.841 --> 26:23.459
But you did rescue her
and that should merit some consideration.

26:23.512 --> 26:27.510
- Thank you.
- I'm not going to ask you to pay for this.

26:29.810 --> 26:33.760
- You're not ?
- No, I'm simply going to take the car back.

26:33.814 --> 26:36.353
- For how long ?
- For ever.

26:36.401 --> 26:39.271
Oh ! Come on, Higgins. You're being unfair.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.645
Perhaps, but that's the way of it.

26:41.698 --> 26:45.363
All right. What if I told you
that I drove a Ferrari through a gate

26:45.409 --> 26:47.367
- and scratched it like this ?
- Ah-ha !

26:47.412 --> 26:50.662
- The truth will out.
- In Sicily, during the rescue.

26:50.707 --> 26:55.037
- It was the Marchese di Como's car.
- So ?

26:55.086 --> 27:00.128
So ? Don't you think it's strange
that somebody put the identical scratch...

27:00.176 --> 27:02.084
- Gouge.
...on my car ?

27:02.136 --> 27:04.757
It's Robin Masters' car.
What are you implying ?

27:04.805 --> 27:09.930
The Marchese di Como is here and out
to get you ? You're becoming quite paranoid.

27:09.977 --> 27:12.682
Higgins,
maybe he's here to get Katrina back.

27:12.730 --> 27:16.064
Have you ever thought of that ?
By the way, where is she ?

27:16.108 --> 27:19.524
- She drove into town.
- What ? And you let her ?

27:19.571 --> 27:23.782
She's a guest here, not a prisoner.
I'm sure she's quite safe.

27:23.825 --> 27:27.111
I can't believe the Marchese
would follow her here.

27:27.162 --> 27:31.160
Men like him collect women as
possessions. He's probably replaced her.

27:31.207 --> 27:34.292
- I hope you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

27:38.131 --> 27:40.374
This is the haole side of the island.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.546
The rich jet in from all over the world
to play here.

27:43.596 --> 27:46.087
That's why they call it the jet set.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.804
- You understand me ?
- Si.

27:49.852 --> 27:54.430
Well, anyway, like I was saying,
the creme de la creme come and sun here.

27:55.399 --> 27:57.309
Dove sta la villa di Robin Masters ?

27:57.360 --> 28:02.152
- Robin... You know Robin Masters ?
- Si, appunto.

28:02.198 --> 28:04.524
Isn't this a small world ?

28:05.368 --> 28:08.654
He's sort of
a close personal acquaintance of mine.

28:08.705 --> 28:11.457
His estate is on the other side of the island.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.582
Digli che ci porti la.

28:14.253 --> 28:18.036
Marchese says
fly over Robin Masters' house.

28:18.090 --> 28:21.708
Well, I don't know.
That's about an hour away from here.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.430
It would cost you
a couple of hundred extra bucks.

28:24.471 --> 28:26.465
Non fa niente. It's OK.

28:26.515 --> 28:29.636
OK. You're the boss.
Or rather, the Marchese.

28:32.313 --> 28:34.104
Say, look here.

28:34.148 --> 28:38.360
Are there gonna be very many other
Italian tourists coming to the island ?

28:38.402 --> 28:42.187
If there is, I can get a jump
on the competition by learning Italian.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.569
I already know a little.

28:43.616 --> 28:46.570
Sil Buongiorno !

28:48.122 --> 28:50.114
Adios, muchacho...

29:08.350 --> 29:11.103
So how did it go with Higgins ?

29:12.105 --> 29:16.351
How did it go with Higgins ?
The usual 50 lashes.

29:18.903 --> 29:20.979
Poor thing.

29:28.163 --> 29:30.701
Who was that ?

29:30.749 --> 29:34.582
That is a buddy of mine and he sometimes
flies tourists over the estate

29:34.628 --> 29:38.673
to see what famous person
might be sunbathing naked on the beach.

29:38.716 --> 29:42.085
- Well, I'm not famous or naked.
- Well, you will be.

29:43.930 --> 29:45.210
Famous.

29:47.892 --> 29:50.050
Isn't that Bo Derek down there ?

29:53.230 --> 29:54.690
Who is that ?

29:54.732 --> 29:57.816
A man who is about to lose
his pilot's license.

29:57.861 --> 29:59.568
Higgie, where's Magnum ?

29:59.613 --> 30:03.313
Probably doing a Burt Reynolds imitation
for the tourists.

30:06.494 --> 30:09.448
What about that scene
we were gonna rehearse ?

30:09.498 --> 30:11.490
What scene is that ?

30:11.542 --> 30:16.084
You know, the one where you're gonna
get rid of the rest of your anger.

30:16.130 --> 30:20.376
- Well, I'm not angry any more.
- You're not angry any more ?

30:40.864 --> 30:43.272
Thomas, dear.

30:45.118 --> 30:47.491
She's obviously in love with you.

30:48.997 --> 30:52.118
She's just a kid
who's been through a rough time.

30:52.167 --> 30:57.043
She's no kid, she's a woman.
A woman you flew to Sicily to rescue.

30:58.215 --> 31:00.208
I mean, come on.

31:00.259 --> 31:04.637
- How romantic can you get ?
- Look, Robin asked me to rescue her.

31:04.680 --> 31:09.141
There's nothing romantic about it.
As a matter of fact, it was pretty scary.

31:10.728 --> 31:13.516
It certainly is the stuff movies are made of.

31:18.319 --> 31:20.893
She's in love with you.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.652
- Maybe that's what's scary.
- Why ?

31:23.700 --> 31:27.283
Not that I'm agreeing
about her being in love with me.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.700
She was watching us today.

31:35.128 --> 31:37.205
Out by the wall.

31:39.883 --> 31:41.960
Why didn't you say something ?

31:43.053 --> 31:45.130
What's to say ?

31:46.515 --> 31:48.592
So she saw us.

31:48.643 --> 31:52.391
No. I said she was watching us.
There's a big difference.

31:54.983 --> 31:57.272
I didn't like the look on her face.

31:57.318 --> 32:03.322
Look, she's been through an ordeal.
She just needs to get a little perspective.

32:03.366 --> 32:06.901
I didn't do anything heroic,
but I did get her out of Sicily.

32:06.953 --> 32:09.030
So maybe for a while she's...

32:09.081 --> 32:13.743
Until she finds a tanned young man on
the beach, she's gonna follow me around.

32:13.794 --> 32:19.133
Like some sort of grateful puppy dog.
But that's certainly nothing to worry about.

32:22.428 --> 32:25.714
- If you say so.
- I say so.

33:21.697 --> 33:25.362
He's got the penthouse suite
and he's had it for a couple of days.

33:25.409 --> 33:28.161
Look, I've been doing a little extra checking.

33:28.204 --> 33:31.655
The Marchese di Como's
a very wealthy man in Sicily.

33:31.707 --> 33:33.617
He has a wife in Rome

33:33.667 --> 33:37.961
and he loves to stock his villa in Sicily
with someone on the younger side.

33:38.006 --> 33:39.914
Like Katrina.

33:39.966 --> 33:44.628
From what you told me about Katrina,
I think she's a little bit over the hill for him.

33:44.679 --> 33:49.886
The word is that he never keeps a mistress
for more than two or three months at a time.

33:49.935 --> 33:53.220
Rick, I get the feeling
you're trying to make a point.

33:54.606 --> 33:58.935
I don't know how beautiful or sexy Katrina is,
but I do know one thing.

33:58.986 --> 34:03.066
The Marchese isn't here to bring her back.
It's just not his style.

34:03.115 --> 34:05.523
Then why is he here ?

34:06.493 --> 34:09.411
A vendetta. He wants you.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.917
No.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.956
Thomas, where do you think
the Black Hand got started ?

34:18.005 --> 34:20.710
Nobody goes for revenge like Sicilians.

34:20.757 --> 34:24.708
These guys blow people away
like they blow candles out.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.335
I think we better call Five-O.

34:27.389 --> 34:31.435
To do what ? Ask the Marchese
if he scratched my car ? Come on, Rick.

34:32.187 --> 34:37.313
- Well, then at least call TC.
- I did. He's flying some tourists around.

34:37.359 --> 34:40.194
So what you're telling me,
it's just me and you ?

34:40.237 --> 34:43.985
Yeah. But at least
we got the advantage of surprise.

34:54.127 --> 34:55.621
Saccu !

35:05.013 --> 35:07.006
Saccu, bussano alla portal

35:09.518 --> 35:10.976
Stupido.

35:24.075 --> 35:29.449
Bonjerno ! Mi hanno domandato di servire
uno bottiglia di vino per una marchese.

35:29.497 --> 35:31.406
Complimento della casa !

35:31.458 --> 35:33.366
Ah !

35:33.418 --> 35:36.751
- Di che parte d'Italia ?
- Io sono... Sicilia.

35:36.796 --> 35:39.916
- Sicilia ? Ehi, I'amico mio e di Sicilia !
- Ah !

36:23.219 --> 36:25.342
Mascalzone, ma chi diavolo e lei ?

36:25.389 --> 36:30.549
You better speak English or American
or Vietnamese or something I understand.

36:30.603 --> 36:34.766
Or you'll take the short cut down
to street level and you'll never know why.

36:34.815 --> 36:37.650
- Who the hell are you ?
- Thomas Magnum.

36:40.362 --> 36:42.687
I took Katrina out of your villa.

36:42.740 --> 36:47.734
- You scratch my beautiful car.
- Well, I'd say we're even on that one.

36:47.787 --> 36:49.245
What makes us even ?

36:49.289 --> 36:52.289
You ran a beer opener
down the side of my car yesterday.

36:52.333 --> 36:57.410
No. But it sounds like fun. I wish I had.

37:15.190 --> 37:17.267
I underestimated you.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.190
- What's your name again ?
- Mag...

37:22.782 --> 37:26.993
- Magnum.
- Oh, yes, Magnum.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.871
I didn't realise you wanted ransom money.

37:30.915 --> 37:36.918
It makes my brilliant plan to recover
my property seem rather... melodramatic.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.964
- Katrina isn't property.
- Katrina ?

37:40.008 --> 37:44.469
Why would I want Katrina ? She is crazy.
I'm glad to be rid of her.

37:44.513 --> 37:48.807
Do you know she tried to murder
a guest's wife I simply looked at too long ?

37:48.850 --> 37:51.140
I had to lock Katrina up.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.604
I told you, Thomas.
Give Thomas the gun back.

38:05.117 --> 38:09.067
If you didn't come here for Katrina,
what did you come here for ?

38:09.121 --> 38:12.242
The Madonna di Verona, of course.

38:13.835 --> 38:17.619
The 16th-century Cellini necklace
Katrina took.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.916
It's priceless.

38:39.195 --> 38:42.978
I say, what's going on here ?

38:44.450 --> 38:47.155
I thought you went out for the day.

38:47.203 --> 38:50.121
The game was called due to rain.

38:53.126 --> 38:58.368
Miss Tremaine, are you...
breaking into Mr. Masters' gun cabinet ?

38:58.423 --> 39:00.499
I haven't stolen anything.

39:02.135 --> 39:04.211
No.

39:04.262 --> 39:07.679
- Of course not. I didn't mean to imply...
- Stop.

39:13.856 --> 39:17.106
Miss Tremaine, why do you need a gun ?

39:18.819 --> 39:20.859
To stop her.

39:21.989 --> 39:24.029
She's after him, you know.

39:24.951 --> 39:29.412
Out to ensnare him.
Like the Marchese did me.

39:30.791 --> 39:32.830
She's no good.

39:33.668 --> 39:35.707
No breeding.

39:35.754 --> 39:37.996
An actress and a bad one.

39:38.047 --> 39:41.168
Not good enough to make it on the stage,
so she teaches.

39:41.217 --> 39:42.877
Katrina...

39:44.638 --> 39:50.926
I think... you'd best let me have the pistol
before you hurt yourself.

39:50.978 --> 39:53.729
You've been through a very difficult...

40:11.624 --> 40:16.452
If Katrina took the necklace,
why didn't you go to the police ?

40:16.504 --> 40:20.372
It's probably stolen.
Either that or he didn't pay the taxes on it.

40:20.426 --> 40:22.714
Taxes ? Why should I pay taxes ?

40:22.761 --> 40:25.762
All they do is give the money
to the communist.

40:25.806 --> 40:29.056
- He didn't pay the taxes on it.
- Higgins, pick it up.

40:39.361 --> 40:41.817
Good lads. Back from patrol.

40:42.782 --> 40:45.819
Zeus, get the phone.

40:50.999 --> 40:53.751
'Higgins ? What took you so long ? '

40:56.713 --> 40:59.749
- 'Higgins ? '
- Magnum.

40:59.799 --> 41:02.088
Higgins, are you playing with the dogs ?

41:02.844 --> 41:05.301
- I've been shot.
- 'What ? '

41:07.391 --> 41:11.720
Katrina. She's after Margo.

41:11.771 --> 41:14.973
- How bad you hit ?
- 'Bad.'

41:18.027 --> 41:22.939
It reminds me of the hit I took at El Alamein.
That was in '41.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.154
- Higgins got shot ?
- Katrina shot him.

41:27.203 --> 41:30.786
I told you, she is crazy.

41:35.503 --> 41:37.580
Is that chopper for you ?

41:37.631 --> 41:42.339
It's part of my brilliant plan to land
at the estate and recover my necklace.

41:42.386 --> 41:44.877
Operator ? I'd like to report an emergency.

41:44.930 --> 41:50.221
A man's been shot at the Robin Masters'
estate. Kalakaua Drive. North Shore.

41:50.269 --> 41:52.392
Yeah. Type AB blood.

41:53.940 --> 41:57.688
Hey. Wait a minute. Thomas,
what am I supposed to do with these guys ?

42:02.490 --> 42:05.360
E una bella... jeornata.

42:05.410 --> 42:07.865
E una bella...

42:15.796 --> 42:17.420
Buongiorno, marchese !

42:17.464 --> 42:20.549
E una bella giornata !

42:20.592 --> 42:24.886
- Nol Get out of here ! I don't believe this.
- Neither do I. Let's go.

42:24.930 --> 42:29.972
- Go where ?
- Up in the air. Take off. I'll explain later.

42:42.239 --> 42:47.579
The performing arts, especially good theatre
and most especially good drama,

42:47.620 --> 42:51.452
have a quality of excitement that,
I personally feel, cannot be found

42:51.500 --> 42:54.205
in any other field of human endeavour.

42:55.295 --> 42:58.629
Excitement in the theatre is generated
by the unexpected.

42:58.673 --> 43:01.759
In the writing, in the acting, and in the...

43:03.428 --> 43:05.551
Oh, no. Don't stop.

43:06.849 --> 43:10.633
I want to hear all about
the unexpected in the theatre.

43:11.437 --> 43:13.145
Miss Tremaine.

43:13.189 --> 43:16.060
No, call me Katrina.

43:17.735 --> 43:20.191
Tom does.

43:20.238 --> 43:22.907
Or Kitty.

43:22.949 --> 43:25.820
Sometimes the Marchese called me Kitty.

43:26.744 --> 43:30.956
In Sicily, when I would scratch him.

43:31.750 --> 43:34.455
- This is not an act.
- Oh, but it is.

43:35.420 --> 43:38.374
It'll be a wonderful performance.

43:38.423 --> 43:43.549
The best I'll ever give.
The last you'll ever see.

43:47.808 --> 43:49.966
Please, no.

43:50.895 --> 43:54.061
Oh... Please, yes.

43:55.441 --> 43:57.481
Katrina !

44:02.740 --> 44:04.400
Katrina...

44:08.621 --> 44:10.745
Wait.

44:12.709 --> 44:15.414
- Margo's done nothing.
- Yes, she has.

44:17.047 --> 44:19.040
What ?

44:19.091 --> 44:21.084
At the estate.

44:21.134 --> 44:25.464
She used her body to entice you.
To take you from me.

44:25.514 --> 44:29.844
- No. I wanted her.
- You wanted me !

44:29.894 --> 44:34.521
I knew that from the moment
I first saw you on the balcony at Sicily.

44:35.358 --> 44:39.570
- You came to save me.
- No, Robin sent me for you.

44:39.612 --> 44:41.569
Lies !

44:41.615 --> 44:44.366
You were in love with me. You came for me.

44:44.409 --> 44:46.781
I'd never met you before that night.

44:46.829 --> 44:49.070
I was just doing a favour for Robin.

44:49.122 --> 44:51.245
That's not true !

44:52.251 --> 44:54.042
Yes, it is.

44:57.881 --> 45:01.298
So if you're gonna have to shoot someone,
shoot me.

45:04.221 --> 45:06.463
I could never shoot you.

45:07.850 --> 45:10.305
I love you.

45:10.353 --> 45:12.429
But I don't love you.

45:51.521 --> 45:53.762
They think it's part of the scene.

46:01.781 --> 46:07.405
"Conversions, perhaps,
brings job satisfaction of exciting kind."

46:07.454 --> 46:10.241
- Five letters and five letters.
- Hi, Higgie.

46:11.834 --> 46:14.455
Good Lord, do my eyes deceive me ?

46:14.503 --> 46:16.875
Higgins, please don't.

46:16.922 --> 46:21.418
Please, it took all the persuasive powers
I have just to get him into it.

46:21.469 --> 46:24.635
I take it you are going
to tonight's opening of the opera.

46:24.680 --> 46:29.721
No, Higgins, we're going to a formal
basketball game. What are you doing ?

46:29.769 --> 46:33.517
- The crossword.
- Not merely the crossword.
