BUT ?

02:48.660 --> 02:51.697

TO PUT MAYA IN THAT SITUATION:

02:56.940 --> 03:00.171

03:23.530 --> 03:25.361
YEAH, WELL,

03:25.470 --> 03:27.131
SO, SHE CAN SEE THEM
WHEN GROWS UP.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.389
WELL, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT IT,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.604
THIS CEREMONY DOES
THE SAME THING.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.134
YOU WANNA GO SO THAT WHEN MAYA
GROWS UP YOU CAN SAY TO HER,

03:34.240 --> 03:37.778

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SEVEN
LE'I'I'ERS FOR HER.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.820

06:21.010 --> 06:23.069

06:23.180 --> 06:25.171
THEY'RE SORT OF
HALFWAY BETWEEN

06:25.280 --> 06:26.975
TULIPS AND ROSES,

06:27.080 --> 06:31.483
EXCEPT THEY HAVE NO THORNS AND
THEY'RE USUALLY PURPLE OR WHITE.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.359
THEY SOUND BEAUTIFUL.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.950
YEAH, THEY ARE.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.688
WE'LL TAKE PURPLE.

06:39.860 --> 06:40.849

YOU'LL PUT HIM OUT THERE ?

06:49.040 --> 06:52.476
AND THEN WHAT ?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.434
YOU COULD SAY A FEW WORDS,
IF YOU WANT.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.201
( whispering )
OH GOD.

06:56.310 --> 06:59.677
"HI, I'M SUZANNE WETHING.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.908
"SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ME
KICKING ROB IN THE PARKING LOT

07:03.020 --> 07:04.817
"AT JEN'S WEDDING.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.754
"ACTUALLY, HE WAS ALREADY DEAD
FROM ALCOHOL POISONING.

07:08.860 --> 07:12.523
SO, YOU CAN JUST ALL STOP
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT."

07:13.460 --> 07:15.451
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.861
OH, WHAT ?
IT'S NO SECRET.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.136
PAIGE KNOWS.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.105
YOUR SISTERS KNOW,
DOT THEY ?

07:28.210 --> 07:30.644
UH-HUH.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.913
DADDY WAS A DRUNK.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.026
OKAY, WHAT IS IT AGAIN,
WATERBURY WHAT ?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.325
"WATERFORD W-COLLECT ION

07:46.430 --> 07:48.694
11 INCH SPIRE STEM VASE".

07:48.800 --> 07:51.166
TERRY DOESN'T
FUCK AROUND, DOES HE ?

07:51.270 --> 07:52.794
NO, WHEN HE REGISTERS,
HE REGISTERS.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.731
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET MARRIED.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.331
SO, WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE
ON VASE-BUYING ERRANDS FOR US ?

07:57.440 --> 07:58.668
NO.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.499
SO, WE CAN
SAY ALL THOSE

08:00.610 --> 08:02.475
"FOREVERS"
AND "NO MATTER WHATS".

08:02.580 --> 08:04.571
YOU'RE IN MY WILL,
I'M IN YOURS.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.238
WE BASICALLY
ARE MARRIED,

08:06.350 --> 08:08.318
EVEN IF THE LAW REFUSES
TO RECOGNIZE IT.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.240
BUT THEN AGAIN, I REFUSE
TO RECOGNIZE MOST OF

08:10.350 --> 08:12.659
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION,
SO, I GUESS IT ALL EVENS OUT.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.182
I STILL THINK SOME SORT
OF CEREMONY IN FRONT OF

08:14.290 --> 08:17.453
ALL OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
WOULD MAKE IT MORE REAL.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.187
I JUST DON'T THINK
NOW'S THE TIME

08:19.290 --> 08:20.689
TO GO INTO BIG
EVENT-PLANNING MODE.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.097
WHY ?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.020
I DON'T KNOW, ALL THE SHIT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH LATELY ?

08:24.130 --> 08:26.325
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME.

08:26.430 --> 08:28.193
WELL, IT NEVER IS.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.098
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO JUST
PICK A MOMENT AND DO IT, RIGHT ?

08:31.210 --> 08:34.236
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE,
NATE MOVING IN WITH BRENDA

08:34.340 --> 08:35.534
AND TAKING MAYA
WITH HIM ?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.176
IF YOU ASK ME,
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.349
YOU THINK ?

08:38.450 --> 08:39.769
WELL, FAST.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.587
LIFE'S SO SHORT, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT FAST IS ANYMORE.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.614
HERE IT IS.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.856
$225 ?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.279
THEY'RE NOT
GETTING THIS FROM US.

08:52.390 --> 08:55.257
YES, THEY ARE,
JUST BITE THE BULLET.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.367
RIGHT HERE.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.199
A GARLIC PRESS
FOR 30 BUCKS.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.029
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE THE GUYS
WHO GAVE THEM THE GARLIC PRESS ?

09:03.140 --> 09:05.108
THEY'LL USE
A GARLIC PRESS WAY MORE

09:05.210 --> 09:07.007
THAN THEY'LL
USE A $225 VASE.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.304
NO.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.509
( beeping )

09:19.320 --> 09:21.959
( door opening
and closing )

09:31.200 --> 09:32.997
I'M HOME.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.748
( phone )

09:58.930 --> 10:00.158
HELLO ?

10:00.260 --> 10:01.158
HI, I WANT
TO SEE MY KIDS.

10:01.260 --> 10:01.919
When ?

10:02.030 --> 10:03.019
TO DAY.

10:03.130 --> 10:03.721
WHAT TIME ?

10:03.830 --> 10:05.468
FIVE, NO, WAIT, SHIT.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.992
LET ME...

10:07.100 --> 10:10.331
LET ME DRIVE THEM
TO KARATE TOMORROW.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.702
AND THEN,
I'LL TAKE 'ETO LUNCH.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.573
YOU CAN'T, WE CARPOOL
WITH THE KOEHLERS TO KARATE.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.307
IF I CHANGE ONE WEEK,
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.049
VANESSA, LOOK, YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME FROM SEEING MY KIDS.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.573
I'm not trying to keep you
from seeing your kids !

10:20.680 --> 10:23.649
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME
OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON

10:23.750 --> 10:25.240
AND PLAY WITH THEM.

10:25.350 --> 10:28.319
AT, AT THE HOUSE ?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.957
YES, THAT WOULD
BE BE'I'I'ER.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.550
OKAY.

10:32.660 --> 10:35.390
I'LL BE THERE
AT TWO.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.798
So, like,
from two to four ?

10:37.900 --> 10:41.495
MAKE IT THREE TO FIVE JUST
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BACK IN TIME.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.206
OK, SEE YOU THEN.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.275
AND I WAS...

10:52.380 --> 10:56.441
HAULING THIS BOX OF METEORITES
OUT TO THE CAR AND I...

10:56.550 --> 10:58.415
AND I THOUGHT,

10:58.520 --> 11:01.318
"J ESUS, GOD,

11:01.420 --> 11:04.526
"LOOK AT YOURSELF,

11:04.630 --> 11:08.054
"MOVING THESE
GODDAMN ROCKS AGAIN.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.367
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP DOING THIS ?"

11:10.470 --> 11:12.199
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAY TOGETHER

11:12.300 --> 11:14.268
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO MOVE YOUR ROCKS ?

11:14.370 --> 11:16.258
NO...

11:18.010 --> 11:20.979
WE SHOULD STAY TOGETHER
BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.247
I LOVE YOU, ANYWAY.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.306
I DO.

11:26.410 --> 11:30.915
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, GEORGE.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.217
BUT THIS IS
MY THOUGHT, HERE:

11:35.490 --> 11:37.629
IF YOU ARE GONNA
BE MY HUSBAND

11:37.730 --> 11:40.096
AND I AM GONNA
BE YOUR WIFE,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.998
IT WILL HAVE TO BE,
IT CAN ONLY BE,

11:43.100 --> 11:46.160
IF SOME CONDITIONS
ARE MET.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.862
SHOOT.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.909
MAINLY, THAT YOU
BEHAVE LIKE A HUSBAND.

11:56.210 --> 11:59.270
AND, TO ME, THAT
MEANS SHARING YOURSELF.

11:59.380 --> 12:04.408
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO FEEL BAD
EVERY TIME I ASK YOU A QUESTION.

12:07.390 --> 12:08.812
ALRIGHT.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.320
AND I WANT A HEALTHY, CONTINUOUS
FLOW OF FAMILY AROUND HERE.

12:11.430 --> 12:16.424
LIKE MAKING A SPACE
FOR KYLE AND BECKY.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.259
BECKY ?

12:19.370 --> 12:21.292
MY FRIEND, BECKY
FROM THE FABRIC SHOP.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.868
I SET THEM UP.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.934
I'M NOT MAD.DON'.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.077
NOT TO MENTION YOUR OTHER
CHILDREN, BRIAN AND MAGGIE.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.968
I HAVEN'T EVEN
MET THEM YET.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.210
ALRIGHT,
YOU'LL MEET THEM.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.051
AND I NEED TO FEEL
LIKE YOU LIKE ME AGAIN.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.151
RUTH !

12:48.460 --> 12:50.223
YOU'RE MY
FAVORITE PERSON.

12:50.330 --> 12:54.096
YOU DON'T MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE YOUR FAVORITE PERSON.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.508
LOOK...

12:57.610 --> 12:59.601
I'LL TRY.

12:59.710 --> 13:03.407
I WILL, I MEAN IT.

13:06.650 --> 13:08.914
I'LL TRY.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.326
YOU POOR THING.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.354
( sniffling )

13:24.330 --> 13:27.299
YES, WE'LL BE AT
THE BLACK FOREST INN, YEAH.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.267
11:10 IN THE MORNING.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.838
YEAH, HOYT...

13:32.940 --> 13:36.671
NO, 1170's
OUR FLIGHT NUMBER,

13:36.780 --> 13:39.101
HOW COULD
WE LAND AT 1170 ?

13:39.210 --> 13:42.543

ALRIGHT, THANKS, BYE.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.214
THAT GUY IS
SUCH A KNOB.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.856
I'LL TAKE YOU GUYS
TO THE AIRPORT.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.723
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.127

13:53.230 --> 13:55.323
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA,
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US ?

13:55.430 --> 13:56.863
NAH, I DON'T
THINK SO.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.564
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CO
TO THE CEREMONY.

13:59.670 --> 14:00.864
JUST COME TO IDAHO.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.528
I REALLY THINK
I'D BE IN THE WAY.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.767
WELL, I REALLY THINK IT WOULD
ACTUALLY MAKE THE WHOLE THING

14:04.870 --> 14:06.132
LIVABLE FOR ME.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.572
HAVING IT BE
THE THREE OF US.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.205

14:13.680 --> 14:15.875
C'MON.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.317
BYRON, I CAN'T.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.024
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH BYRON TOMORROW.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.382
I THINK BYRON WILL BE FINE
IF HE MISSES A SESSION.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.821
YOU' ONLY BEEN
SEEING HIM FOR LIKE, A MONTH.

14:26.930 --> 14:27.999
NO, EXACTLY.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.453
IT'S TOO SOON
TO LEAVE HIM

14:29.560 --> 14:31.596
HANGING OUT ALL BY HIMSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF REALITY.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.260
WHAT ABOUT
MY REALITY ?

14:41.410 --> 14:43.708

15:02.460 --> 15:03.893

15:04.000 --> 15:05.297
THIS SHOULD

15:05.400 --> 15:06.799

15:06.900 --> 15:07.969
THIS SHOULD
BE ILLEGAL !

15:08.070 --> 15:09.935
I KNOW, WHAT

15:10.040 --> 15:11.837
PEOPLE TRYING TO GET OTHER
PEOPLE TO DANCE !

15:11.940 --> 15:13.976
IT DOESN'T WORK.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.611
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.942

18:44.050 --> 18:46.041

18:51.890 --> 18:54.688

19:14.920 --> 19:15.511
HEY.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.542

19:17.650 --> 19:20.255
OH, MY GOD, YOU SCARED
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF ME !

19:20.360 --> 19:23.227
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

19:23.330 --> 19:26.356
ANITA AND I
CRASHED HERE,

19:26.460 --> 19:29.657
SHE LEFI' EARLY
THIS MORNING,

19:31.730 --> 19:34.893
BUT I FELL INTO
A K-HOLE LAST NIGHT,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.764
AND...

19:37.870 --> 19:40.771
I'M CLIMBING OUT
RIGHT NOW.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.700
WHO HAD K
LAST NIGHT ?

19:42.810 --> 19:44.869
I DON'T KNOW.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.778
HOW WAS IT, FUN ?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.609
I DON'T KNOW.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.608
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN RAPED
AND WILL ONLY RECOVER THE MEMORY

19:51.720 --> 19:54.587
UNDER INTENSE HYPNOSIS
10 YEARS FROM NOW.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.817
THAT'S COOL.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.699
MOM.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.824
NDER.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.227
I CAN'T FIND IT.

20:03.330 --> 20:06.265
EXCUSE ME ?

20:07.130 --> 20:08.529
THIS MEAT IS
SO TENDER.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.507
I THINK WE GOT
THE MARINADE RIGHT, ED !

20:11.610 --> 20:12.634
MM-HMM.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.731
IT'S GREAT.

20:18.010 --> 20:21.514
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU AND MAYA
TO FIND THE TIME TO GET AWAY ?

20:21.620 --> 20:24.282
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON ?

20:24.390 --> 20:27.814
NOTHING AS
IMPORTANT AS THIS.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.827
IT'S BEEN
HARD LATELY.

20:33.930 --> 20:37.229
YOU THINK YOU FINALLY GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FEELINGS,

20:38.300 --> 20:40.632
AND THEN
THERE ARE MORE.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.468
YEAH.

20:46.270 --> 20:48.977
OKAY, BYRON, JUST
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.799
I'm on a bridge.

20:51.910 --> 20:52.945
WHERE ?

20:53.050 --> 20:54.472
Los Feliz.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.946
I'm sitting
on the ledge.

20:57.050 --> 20:59.712
BYRON, YOU NEED TO GET DOWN
OFF THAT LEDGE RIGHT NOW.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.789
THERE'S SO MANY CARS,

21:05.030 --> 21:08.852
AND EACH ONE OF THEM
HAS SOMEONE INSIDE, DRIVING.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.498
And all those people,
they all feel things

21:12.600 --> 21:15.398
every bit as deeply
as you and I do.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.367
BYRON, I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME, OKAY ?

21:18.470 --> 21:20.802
I'D LIKE YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME, TOO.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.901
I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO HONOR YOUR COMMITMENTS.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.898
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S
NOT SOMETHING YOU THINK

21:25.010 --> 21:26.102
YOU SHOULD DO.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.973
I'M SORRY, I HAD
A FAMILY MATTER COME UP.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.809
I NEEDED
TO ATTEND TO IT.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.410
Are you married ?

21:31.520 --> 21:35.251
THAT'S NOT REALLY RELEVANT TO
THE WORK WE'RE DOING TOGETHER.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.385
WAS IT SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT ?

21:37.490 --> 21:39.151
OR DID YOU JUST
BLOW ME OFF ?

21:39.260 --> 21:40.818
I rescheduled
with you--

21:40.930 --> 21:43.990
YOU LEFT A MESSAGE TELLING ME
WHEN YOU WOULD BE AVAILABLE !

21:44.100 --> 21:45.590
If you had
an emergency--

21:45.700 --> 21:47.429
I AM HAVING
AN EMERGENCY !

21:47.540 --> 21:49.132
BYRON, PLEASE
GET OFF THE BRIDGE.

21:49.240 --> 21:53.404
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED ME
TO CROSS THE DAMN BRIDGE !

21:53.510 --> 21:56.832
Yes, and now, I'd like you
to get off the bridge,

21:56.940 --> 21:59.647
SO, THAT WE CAN CONTINUE
OUR WORK TOGETHER, OKAY ?

21:59.750 --> 22:02.639
OUR WORK TOGETHER
IS IMPORTANT.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.982
I'M NOT ON A BRIDGE.

22:07.090 --> 22:08.887
WHERE ARE YOU ?

22:08.990 --> 22:12.027
I'm in my living room.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.223
WHY CAN I HEAR
TRAFFIC ?

22:14.330 --> 22:17.458
That's just
my air conditioner.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.434
SEE, I WAS JUST
PRETENDING.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.817
BYRON, THAT WAS
VERY DISHONEST OF YOU.

22:36.550 --> 22:39.144
IF YOU DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN,

22:39.250 --> 22:40.512
I'LL HAVE
TO STOP SEEING YOU,

22:40.620 --> 22:42.485
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ?

22:42.590 --> 22:44.080
Do you understand ?

22:44.190 --> 22:45.953
YES.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.858
GOOD, I'M GONNA
HANG UP NOW.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.099
OKAY, GOODBYE.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.802
SAY CHEESE, MAYA.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.777
WHOO, THAT WAS
A GOOD ONE, GOOD JOB !

23:03.880 --> 23:06.678
KICK IT BACK,
CAN YOU KICK IT BACK ?

23:06.780 --> 23:08.543
UNCLE NATE ?

23:08.650 --> 23:11.744
DID YOU EVER GIVE
DAVID, STIFF ?

23:11.850 --> 23:13.317
UH... WHAT ?

23:13.420 --> 23:14.512
THE BOOK I GAVE YOU
TO GIVE TO HIM

23:14.620 --> 23:16.417
WHEN WE TOOK MAYA
TO LEGOLAND ?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.455
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
I DIDN'T, I'M SORRY.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.222
I COMPLETELY SPACED.

23:22.330 --> 23:23.820
BUT...

23:23.930 --> 23:26.421
BUT YOU KNOW,

23:26.530 --> 23:29.431
I CAN SEE RIGHT WHERE IT IS,
THOUGH, IN MY HEAD.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.405
SO, WHEN I GET BACK,
I'LL GIVE IT TO HIM.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.068
YOU COULD
READ IT TOO.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.307
IT'S VERY
INFORMATIVE.

23:34.410 --> 23:35.570
OKAY.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.272
MAYBE I'LL DO THAT.

23:37.380 --> 23:39.007
OKAY.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.350
YOU LOOK TIRED.

23:54.460 --> 23:55.597
IAM.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.497
IF YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE INN,

23:57.600 --> 23:59.420
MAYA CAN PLAY
WITH THE KIDS.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.498
HOYT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.534
CAREFUL, YOU GUYS.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.665

24:05.770 --> 24:06.998
WE'RE JUST HAVIN' FUN.

WHOO, WHOO !

24:09.410 --> 24:12.447

24:12.550 --> 24:14.541
AND WE'LL BRING MAYA BACK

24:14.650 --> 24:18.108
WE'RE, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES

24:18.220 --> 24:20.882
SHE'LL BE FINE,
IT'S FAMILY.

24:20.990 --> 24:22.685
ALRIGHT.

24:22.790 --> 24:27.079
JUST GIVE ME A CALL

26:14.140 --> 26:15.630
OKAY.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.209
YOUR LITTLE BOY
IS SO CUTE.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.847
THAN KS.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.009
IS HE...

26:27.110 --> 26:28.145
ADOPTED ?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.946
YEAH, ABOUT A YEAR
AND A HALF AGO FROM GUATEMALA.

26:31.050 --> 26:33.757
MY PARTNER AND I HAVE HAD,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

26:33.860 --> 26:36.385
THE MOST PRELIMINARY OF
ADOPTION CONVERSATIONS.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.482
WHICH AGENCY
DID YOU USE ?

26:39.590 --> 26:41.126
WHOLE FAMILY CENTER.

26:41.230 --> 26:43.198
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE,

26:43.300 --> 26:45.518
AND THEY'VE GOT REALLY STRONG
CONNECTIONS IN GUATEMALA,

26:45.630 --> 26:47.632
WITH THE BUREAUCRACY,
WHICH IS GREAT.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.435
BUT THEY'RE
KIN DA RELIGIOUS.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.064
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.137
UH...

26:52.240 --> 26:53.332
I THINK SO.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.078
THEY DON'T WORK
WITH GAY COUPLES.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.034
SO...OH.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.745
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY RAINBOW
KIDS, OR SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.341
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.611
SURE.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.523
HEY!

27:14.630 --> 27:16.552
YOU CAME BACK !

27:16.660 --> 27:19.823
WHERE'S MAYA ?

27:19.930 --> 27:23.297
SHE'S PLAYING WITH HER COUSINS
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.038
MISS ME ?

27:25.140 --> 27:28.337
NO, I WAS TOO BUSY HAVING
A TOTALLY SURREAL PHONE SESSION

27:28.440 --> 27:30.601
WITH MY CLIENT.

27:30.710 --> 27:31.904
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED ?

27:32.010 --> 27:35.047
I CAN'T TELL YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.311
OH, C'MON.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.615
HOW MUCH DO I UNLOAD ON YOU
ABOUT ALL THE FREAKY PEOPLE

27:39.720 --> 27:41.210
I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH AT WORK ?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.514
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.518
NOT REALLY.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.587
YEAH, REALLY.

27:44.690 --> 27:47.056
UH-UH.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.357
THIS IS THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW,
CLIENT PRIVILEGE DOCTOR THING.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.792
IT'S VERY
PROFESSIONAL.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.097
HOW DO I KNOW THIS CLIENT
EXISTS ANYWAY, HUH ?

27:56.200 --> 27:59.863
HOW DO I KNOW THIS ISN'T SOME
HOT GUY YOU'VE GOT ON THE SIDE ?

28:04.250 --> 28:05.672
IWAS.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.475
I'M NOT
REALLY WORRIED--

28:07.580 --> 28:08.717
I KNOW, I KNOW.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.311
I WOULDN'T HAVE MOVED IN
IF I WAS WORRIED.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.225
MMM...

28:20.660 --> 28:22.924
YOU KNOW, THIS IS...

28:23.030 --> 28:25.726
LIKE THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.037
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.938
THE OTHER TIMES, WE NEVER
REALLY HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.134
ONE OF US WAS ALWAYS
ESCAPING, OR LYING--

28:34.240 --> 28:36.674
OR STONED--

28:36.780 --> 28:39.305
OR SOMETHING.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.771
BUT NOW,
WE'RE REALLY HERE.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.852
YOU KNOW, I DROVE BACK HERE
TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.928
THAT I MISS YOU...

28:51.030 --> 28:54.022
AND...

28:55.960 --> 28:57.769
TO MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T ESCAPE ?

28:57.870 --> 29:01.067
OH, YEAH, YEAH...

29:05.670 --> 29:11.006
* IT'S GONNA BE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY *

29:12.180 --> 29:13.442
THIS ONE'S COOL.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.916
OH, YUCK.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.944
IF YOU LIKE
NOSTRILS.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.381
CLAIRE.

29:20.490 --> 29:23.687
NO, I CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND
OF DOCUMENTATION OF MY NOSE

29:23.790 --> 29:26.281
JUST LYING AROUND.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.426
MAYBE IF I JUST
RIP OUT MY NOSE.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.728
THERE.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.398
THAT'S BETTER.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.846
MMM.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.741
NOSTRILLY GOODNESS.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.477
STOP.

29:48.580 --> 29:49.569
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.147
STOP, STOP IT.

30:03.360 --> 30:07.296
OH, I'M SO MUCH HAPPIER
WHEN I'M HIGH.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.505
* SOME DAY
I'LL GET IT RIGHT *

30:15.880 --> 30:20.806
* I SWEAR
I'LL GET IT RIGHT *

30:20.920 --> 30:25.141
* TODAY IS GONNA
BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY *

30:26.550 --> 30:28.484
I GOT YOUR EYES.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.134
THAT'S SO SCARY.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.867
I WISH YOU
COULD SEE THIS.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.039
WELL, GET MY CAMERA.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.301
IT'S RIGHT
OVER THERE.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.645
HOW'S THE LIGHT
IN HERE ?

30:52.750 --> 30:54.240
GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.

30:55.150 --> 30:56.845
OKAY.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.152
PUCKER UP.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.921
YEAH.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.726
THE PROBLEM IS
NOT NUCLEAR WAR.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.264
THE PROBLEM IS WHAT'S
GONNA CAUSE NUCLEAR WAR.

31:14.370 --> 31:17.237
I DON'T SEE US LIVING
THROUGH A NUCLEAR WAR, GEORGE.

31:17.340 --> 31:18.534
OF COURSE NOT.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.198
NOT A WHOLE LOT
OF PEOPLE WILL.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.777
NO, I MEAN,
IN OUR LIFETIME.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.233
I DON'T SEE IT
HAPPENING.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.307
HA!

31:24.410 --> 31:26.878
I MARRIED THE
GLASS-IS-HALF-FULL GIRL.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.618
WHICH TIME ?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.312
OH, THIS TIME.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.139
OF COURSE, YES,
WHAT WAS I THINKING ?

31:34.020 --> 31:35.885
THIS DECAF IS
SO CINNAMONY.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.083
ISN'T IT ?

31:38.190 --> 31:41.694
I THINK WHEN THE NEXT
A-BOMB IS LAUNCHED,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.256
IT'LL BE OVER GOD.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.861
WHOSE ?

31:44.970 --> 31:46.289
EXACTLY.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.594
THE FUNDAMENTALISTS,

31:47.700 --> 31:49.565
ISLAMIC, CHRISTIAN,
AND OTHERWISE,

31:49.670 --> 31:51.763
ARE ALL GOING TO CONSPIRE
TO END THE WORLD THE WAY

31:51.870 --> 31:53.804
ALL THEIR HOLY BOOKS
SAID IT WOULD.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.502
WITH A BIG WAR.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.601
YES, BUT ALL THOSE TH EOLOGIES
HAVE A MESSAGE OF HOPE

31:57.710 --> 31:59.302
AND BROTHERLY LOVE
IN THEM, TOO.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.241
TO COUNTERBALANCE
THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE

32:01.350 --> 32:03.011
OF SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.111
WHEREAS CORPORATISM...

32:05.220 --> 32:06.710
WE KNOW,
WE KNOW, DAD.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.082
YOU THINK
IT'LL ALL BE ABOUT OIL,

32:08.190 --> 32:09.657
JUST LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.125
OIL.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.822
CLOSE.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.192
WATER.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.255
OH.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.157
THE APOCALYPSE
WILL BE OVER WATER.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.194
WHO HAS IT,
WHO WANTS IT,

32:19.300 --> 32:21.860
AND WHAT THEY'RE
WILLING TO DO TO GET IT.

32:21.970 --> 32:24.609
BUT GLOBAL WARMING,
ISN'T IT,

32:24.710 --> 32:27.065
I THOUGHT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO
MELT THE GLACIERS OR SOMETHING.

32:27.170 --> 32:29.274
WELL, IF YOU LIKE
YOUR WATER SALTY,

32:29.380 --> 32:31.041
I GUESS
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.277
BUT WHAT ABOUT
RISING SEA LEVELS

32:33.380 --> 32:36.110
OR THE DISRUPTION
OF THE THERMAL HALINE CONVEYOR.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.869
THAT'S THE GULF STREAM.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.139
OH.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.717
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT
THE PENTAGON REPORT

32:40.820 --> 32:42.117
ON THE GUARDIAN
WEB SITE ?

32:42.220 --> 32:43.255
NO.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.419
YOU HAVE A COMPUTER
HERE, RIGHT ?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.020
YEAH, SURE, DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE OFFICE.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.995
WE'RE DONE, RIGHT ?

32:49.100 --> 32:50.749
I THINK SO.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.122
YOU HAVE
TO SEE THIS.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.437
SO, SHOW ME,
SHOW ME.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.429
THIS STUFF WAS ACTUALLY
PUBLISHED BY THE PENTAGON

32:57.540 --> 32:59.735
AND IT BASICALLY SAYS,
YOU KNOW, IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN

32:59.840 --> 33:03.139
TWO AND 20 YEARS
FROM NOW, KABLOOIE.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.379
KYLE LOVES ON-LINE.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.711
GEORGE, TOO.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.173
IT'S JUST
SO ABSURD !

33:10.280 --> 33:12.419
THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE
KIDS WAITING FOR HOMES,

33:12.520 --> 33:15.216
AND PEOPLE STILL HAVE THE NERVE
TO SAY WHO'S GOOD ENOUGH

33:15.320 --> 33:17.413
AND WHO ISN'T,
BASED ON ARE YOU GAY OR NOT ?

33:17.520 --> 33:18.726
PEOPLE ARE STUPID.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.149
WHAT A SHOCK.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.421
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE,
BUT FUCKIN' EGGS.

33:22.530 --> 33:25.499
YEAH, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
WE NEEDED THEM AND WE DIDN'T.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.329
TWICE.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.761
WHAT'S THIS ?

33:28.870 --> 33:30.337
OH GOD,
JUST TH ROW THAT AWAY.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.704
TRUST ME,
DON'T EVEN WASH IT OUT.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.334
OKAY.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.669
I THINK WE MIGHT
HAVE SOME

33:37.780 --> 33:39.543
RICE-A-RONI
IN HERE OR SOMETHING.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.310
OH, MY GOD.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.216
WHAT IS IT ?

33:44.320 --> 33:47.209
IT'S A CHINESE BABY !

33:49.160 --> 33:50.354
WHAT'S IT DOING
IN THE CUPBOARD ?

33:50.460 --> 33:52.758
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
LEFT HER HERE FOR US !

33:52.860 --> 33:54.088
WHO ?

33:54.200 --> 33:57.692
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMEONE CHINESE.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.192
WHAT ?

34:01.970 --> 34:03.767
COUSCOUS.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.238
IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.518
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN HERE ?

34:19.620 --> 34:21.019
IT'S PAST MIDNIGHT.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.054
IT'S FUCKING
UNBELIEVABLE.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.889
WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS
INFORMATION LAID OUT

34:24.990 --> 34:26.287
IN FRONT OF YOU
LIKE THIS,

34:26.390 --> 34:28.153
IT'S A WONDER ANYONE CAN
GET UP IN THE MORNING.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.490
WELL, NO ONE'S GETTING UP
IN THE MORNING AT THIS RATE.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.591
COME TO BED.

34:32.700 --> 34:33.997
IN A MINUTE.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.261
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS SITE.

34:36.370 --> 34:38.031
OH.

34:38.140 --> 34:40.108
WELL, THE GRAPHIC
IS A LITTLE SIMPLISTIC.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.132
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
DESIGNED FOR THE LAYMAN.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.730
BUT YOU CAN LITERALLY
WATCH THE WORLD'S

34:43.840 --> 34:47.003
POTABLE WATER SUPPLY DRIPPING
AWAY, MOMENT BY MOMENT.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.112
BUT THAT'S...

34:49.220 --> 34:51.245
THAT'S JUST SOME
PEOPLE'S OPINION.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.317
IT'S NOT AN OPINION.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.354
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC
HYPOTH ESIS.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.281
BUT LET'S JUST SAY
THEY'RE HALF-RIGHT,

34:57.390 --> 34:59.358
WHICH, CHANCES ARE,
THEY ARE,

34:59.460 --> 35:01.690
BUT EVEN IF THEY'RE
ONLY HALF-RIGHT,

35:01.800 --> 35:04.189
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF
THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING

35:04.300 --> 35:06.188
IN ORDER TO PREVENT IT,
MUCH LESS REVERSE THE TREND.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.188
BUT IT'S ALL
SO PESSIMISTIC.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.131
IF IT HAPPENS
WE'LL DIE.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.834
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
CAN'T WE BE HAPPY ?

35:12.940 --> 35:14.168
HAPPY ?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.406
YES, HAPPINESS !

35:15.510 --> 35:18.001
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HAPPINESS ?

35:18.110 --> 35:19.270
RUTH.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.211
I'M CRAWLING MY WAY
TO COMFORTABLE.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.289
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT BEING HAPPY

35:24.390 --> 35:27.518
UNLESS I'M DOING SOMETHING
TO HELP SAVE THIS PLANET,

35:27.620 --> 35:29.508
OR AT LEAST PREPARE MYSELF
AND MY LOVED ONES

35:29.620 --> 35:31.326
FOR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT'S COMING NEXT.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.399
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE END
OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT HERE.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.422
BUT YOU'RE OBSESSING
ABOUT TH ESE--

35:36.530 --> 35:38.760
I DON'T THINK
I'M OBSESSING.

35:38.870 --> 35:43.591
WELL, YOU'RE DOWN HERE
INSTEAD OF SLEEPING,

35:43.700 --> 35:45.600
DREAMING GOOD DREAMS.

35:49.110 --> 35:50.600
COME TO BED.

35:53.950 --> 35:55.611
ALRIGHT.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.413
I'LL COME TO BED.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.824
( giggling )

36:12.370 --> 36:15.134
LISA IS HERE WITH US

36:15.240 --> 36:17.162
RIGHT NOW.

36:18.070 --> 36:20.163
NOT IN THIS URN.

36:20.270 --> 36:22.329
BUT IN ALL OF US.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.708
EACH OF US HERE TODAY,

36:25.810 --> 36:27.300
ESPECIALLY LITTLE MAYA,

36:27.410 --> 36:30.573
SHARES A PART IN CARRYING
LISA'S ETERNAL LIFE

36:30.680 --> 36:33.581
INTO THE FUTURE.

36:33.690 --> 36:37.251
MAY THIS DEDICATION
OF LISA'S HUMBLE ASHES TODAY

36:37.360 --> 36:40.352
BE FOR ALL OF US
A REAWAKENING

36:40.460 --> 36:44.123
TO THE SPARKLING
AND STILL-VIVID WAYS

36:44.230 --> 36:47.859
HER SPIRIT
CONTINUES TO LIVE,

36:47.970 --> 36:51.189
GROW, AND FLOURISH

36:51.310 --> 36:55.508
IN THE LIVES OF
THOSE SHE LOVED.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.771
LET US PRAY.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.700
OUR PARENT...

36:59.810 --> 37:04.816
( all )
WHO ART IN HEAVEN,
HALLOWED BE THY NAME...

37:04.920 --> 37:06.148
STOP IT.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.753
I WANT THE CRYING
TO STOP...

37:08.860 --> 37:10.088
NOW.

37:10.190 --> 37:12.454
