00:59.359 --> 01:01.827
[Hercules Yells]
MAGERA!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.201
[Hercules Yells]
MAGERA!

01:13.173 --> 01:15.140
[Hercules Yells]
MAGERA!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.390
[Hercules Yells]
MAGERA!

01:31.392 --> 01:34.393
[Magera Whispers]
Shhh...Quiet.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.464
[Cup Shatters]

01:58.751 --> 02:01.053
What has happened to you?

02:01.855 --> 02:03.222
Please no!

02:03.224 --> 02:08.961
[Screaming]

02:16.970 --> 02:21.406
[Hercules Screaming]

02:26.279 --> 02:29.414
[Hercules Yelling/Sobbing]

03:31.277 --> 03:36.548
[Grunts]
[Swords Colliding]

03:36.550 --> 03:38.116
Not bad.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.021
[Grunts]

03:47.460 --> 03:52.097
[Grunts]
[Sword Colliding]

03:52.099 --> 03:52.898
Cyrus: General.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.499
Arias: Impressive.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.168
You fight like a girl.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.637
Ah, like a girl, huh?

03:58.639 --> 04:03.275
[Grunts/Swords Collide]

04:12.518 --> 04:20.392
[Grunts/Swords Collide]

04:22.128 --> 04:25.097
Looks like [Heavy Breathing]
you just been beaten by a girl.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.232
[Laughing]

04:27.234 --> 04:29.067
Do you yield?

04:31.771 --> 04:33.572
I yield.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.209
Impressive, Horace.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.611
Except that I lost.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.281
No shame in losing to the best.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.650
You arrogant bastard.

04:44.652 --> 04:48.086
[Clapping]

04:48.088 --> 04:50.922
Nothing wrong with arrogance...

04:50.924 --> 04:54.426
as long as it coexists
with talent.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.495
Which it does with you, Arias.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.831
See my influence in every move
that you make.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.335
Which is why, I am making you my
new captain.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.303
You mean...

05:04.305 --> 05:07.205
Yes! I'm promoting you,
my friend.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.707
Thank you, General.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.509
Scoundrel.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.110
So, it's true.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.179
And you said it was just
a rumor.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.416
If we were all born leaders, then
there would be no followers.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.885
Wouldn't you agree, Horace?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.787
[Theodora]
Did I miss the match?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.522
Yes you did, my love.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.990
[Theodora
Who won?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.059
I did, of course!

05:27.061 --> 05:30.395
Well, tell her the great news!

05:30.397 --> 05:32.164
Great news? Well, what is it?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.666
I have just been promoted
to Captain.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.636
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.710
Alright you two,
save it for the wedding.

05:44.712 --> 05:49.147
Forgive me, Horace. I didn't mean to
offend your prudish sensibilities.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.384
Prudish? You should know me
better then that.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.785
[Laughs]

05:55.188 --> 05:56.621
So, the two of you shall wed?

05:56.623 --> 05:58.523
Yes.

05:59.692 --> 06:04.062
And as best man, I can only
say... she should be wedding me.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.597
[Laughs]

06:06.265 --> 06:07.499
Are you hungry?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.835
My mother has invited you all
to a feast.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.370
To celebrate our engagement.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.838
Sounds delightful.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.508
I will attend. See you then.
Horace.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.276
General

06:20.380 --> 06:23.415
Horace: Good riddance.
Arrogant aristocrat.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.716
Theodora: Horace!

06:24.718 --> 06:26.618
Arias: He's just jealous.

06:26.620 --> 06:31.223
Please. Jealous of that donkey
in a General's outfit?

06:31.225 --> 06:32.691
[Theodora Laughs]

06:32.693 --> 06:35.827
He was born of a silver spoon
in his mouth.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.664
I just don't understand your
blind devotion to Nikos.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.338
How many times do we have to
speak about this?

06:46.340 --> 06:49.608
Apparently, a few more until you
will listen to reason.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.377
Queen: What exactly is
reasonable about conquering

06:52.379 --> 06:54.413
a completely peaceful village?

06:54.415 --> 06:58.784
If you want a reason to attack
Haon, I can give you thousands.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.085
Millions.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.954
King: The gold in their mines,
is that your reason?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.624
Yes. Of course.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.359
They're discovering
more each day,

07:07.361 --> 07:09.861
and their people are growing
wealthier and wealthier.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.862
While we--

07:10.864 --> 07:12.898
[King Interrupts]
While we what?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.099
Starve?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.803
King: Is there not enough food
on your plate?

07:17.805 --> 07:21.706
Unlike you, your grace,
I know what it's like to be poor.

07:21.708 --> 07:26.244
And if we do not expand,
we will end up that way again.

07:26.246 --> 07:30.982
I am not going to attack a village
and overthrow it's leaders

07:30.984 --> 07:33.151
simply to attain its riches,

07:33.153 --> 07:37.289
and to claim some things
that we have no right to have.

07:37.291 --> 07:41.860
That gold belongs to whoever has
the might and will to take it.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.828
To you.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.930
To us.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.998
We have to do it now,
while we have the power.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.836
Queen: What power we have comes from
the fact that our people respect us.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.370
That will work for us.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.774
We risk losing everything,
for what?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.409
A few gold nuggets?

07:57.411 --> 08:00.512
Who are you to lecture me about greed
while you sit here on your royal--

08:00.514 --> 08:03.748
[King Interrupts Yelling] Who are you
to talk to your Queen like that?!

08:05.852 --> 08:08.787
Forgive my insolence,
your Highness.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.490
This meeting is adjourned.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.358
Leave now!

08:13.360 --> 08:14.793
Gladly.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.049
Am I interrupting?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.251
Cousin!

08:39.253 --> 08:40.051
Ah!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.019
[Laughs]

08:41.020 --> 08:44.022
Iona, dear,
a plate, huh?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.659
Do not bother, Iona.
Thank you.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.693
Erasmus.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.397
I'm to have dinner with the King
and the Queen this evening.

08:52.399 --> 08:56.334
I wouldn't expect you to dine
with common folk like us then.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.036
I have news I wanted
to share with you both.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.338
Theodora is not with child
already, is she?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.339
Tymek!

09:01.341 --> 09:03.441
Of course not.

09:03.443 --> 09:06.778
I'm to be made captain
in the King's army.

09:08.915 --> 09:12.484
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
-I'm proud of you, cousin.

09:12.486 --> 09:15.487
You know the army could use a man
with your leadership qualities.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.923
You'd have to point a sword
at my back.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.025
I'm quite happy where I am.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.911
Isn't it beautiful?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.847
Only rivaled by your beauty.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.328
Arias.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.395
Tell me.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.899
Are you looking forward
to the wedding?

10:00.901 --> 10:04.336
I think of nothing else.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.471
Why would you even ask?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.874
Well...I know men value
their bachelorhood.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.611
Who told you that, Horace?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.546
[Laughs]
Maybe.

10:14.548 --> 10:17.515
Well, he is hardly
the expert on love.

10:17.517 --> 10:21.686
[Laughs]
And what makes you an expert?

10:21.688 --> 10:24.789
I have loved you
since I met you.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.958
That is years ago.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.397
And I am blessed
by the gods.

10:43.509 --> 10:46.945
Nikos: We knew this day
would come!

10:46.947 --> 10:52.417
Nikos: A day when we would seize back
our power and reclaim our kingdom!

10:52.419 --> 10:58.156
King Demetrius is weak, and our
people have fallen into despair.

10:58.158 --> 11:04.963
If he is unwilling to do anything,
then we must take control of our own fate.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.566
We must stand together and take
back what is rightfully ours!

11:08.568 --> 11:14.739
[Cheering]

11:14.741 --> 11:16.541
Today...

11:16.543 --> 11:19.077
We shall show our might...

11:19.079 --> 11:23.515
And I shall lead Enos
into the future.

11:23.517 --> 11:29.587
Know this, we must destroy
before we can rebuild!

11:29.589 --> 11:33.725
Mercy is for the weak!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.093
Brothers!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.428
Take Arms!

11:36.430 --> 11:38.063
[Cheering]

11:38.065 --> 11:39.864
This is your destiny!

11:39.866 --> 11:43.568
[Cheering]

11:45.738 --> 11:53.011
[Chaos Outside]

12:06.025 --> 12:07.792
What is that?

12:11.864 --> 12:13.732
We're being attacked!

12:15.835 --> 12:17.535
I have to find Horace
and the others.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.571
And see what is happening.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.772
Let me come with you.

12:20.774 --> 12:21.673
No.

12:21.675 --> 12:22.841
I'm scared.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.076
It is far too dangerous.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.878
Stay with your family.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.684
Be careful.

12:32.686 --> 12:37.222
I shall return soon. If for some reason
I shall not, you have to flee.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.858
Go to my cousin Tymek's,
he will help you.

12:45.898 --> 12:53.371
[Chaos]

13:10.656 --> 13:11.890
Father!

13:12.324 --> 13:14.092
What is happening?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.961
I don't know my dear.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.477
[Groans]

13:36.949 --> 13:39.050
You two, run! Run!

13:41.687 --> 13:42.887
Hide you two, hide!

13:42.889 --> 13:44.622
Go, Go!

13:52.765 --> 13:54.899
What's this?

13:54.901 --> 13:57.035
I'm reliving you
of your command.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.872
This is outrageous!
I will not allow that!

14:00.874 --> 14:02.607
No.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.776
I did not think you would.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.814
Queen: Demetrius!

14:10.549 --> 14:12.250
Queen: Demetrius!

14:17.156 --> 14:19.657
The townspeople will never
respect your rule.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.759
They do not have to respect me.

14:21.761 --> 14:26.164
They will live by my rule,
or they will die.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.772
I know what I choose.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.275
Queen: Demetrius.
[Theodora Gasps]

14:47.152 --> 14:54.826
[Chaos]

15:00.065 --> 15:01.065
You!

15:01.067 --> 15:02.367
[Grunts]

15:02.369 --> 15:04.669
What on Earth are you doing?
These are civilians.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.337
[Grunts]

15:06.339 --> 15:07.405
Horace: Arias!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.774
[Grunts]

15:09.776 --> 15:12.210
Two against one,
that's not very fair.

15:17.716 --> 15:24.489
[Grunts]

15:32.932 --> 15:35.166
These are Nikos' soldiers.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.469
Do you still think your mentor
is a man of honor?

15:38.471 --> 15:41.806
I'm sure there must be
an explanation.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.075
Then let's go find out.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.149
Cut off their heads.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.452
Hang them on the city gates.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.888
[Theodora Crying]

16:12.604 --> 16:17.709
[Screaming]

16:18.477 --> 16:21.045
Princess.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.829
Over the mountain, in the city
of Sagev...

16:37.831 --> 16:39.230
Yes?

16:39.232 --> 16:44.235
It is rumored that the man known
as Hercules resides there.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.903
Hercules...
[Men Laughing]

16:45.905 --> 16:47.839
Hercules again.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.842
Arias, those are just stories
from our youth.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.844
People have seen him.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.346
People other then General Nikos?

16:55.348 --> 16:59.050
Hercules has been known to aid
to those in need.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.220
He has the strength of 20 men.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.355
Maybe we could convince him
to join our cause.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.290
[Distant noise outside the door]

17:07.126 --> 17:08.291
Oh, Tymek.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.993
Peace, Brothers.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.929
-Have you got news from the castle?
-I have.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.398
Although, you're going
to wish I hadn't.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.500
It's the King and Queen.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.335
-Alive?
-I'm afraid not.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.304
The King by Niko's hand,
and the Queen by her own.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.606
Treachery.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.777
Their heads are posted on stakes
outside the castle gates.

17:25.779 --> 17:26.644
And the Princess?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.112
-She's alive.
-She's safe?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.947
Afraid not, cousin.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.417
Nikos has her.
She's being held captive.

17:32.419 --> 17:36.788
That's it! With or without you,
I'm going in.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.890
I will not allow it.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.893
If you get killed, how does that
help Theodora?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.895
Fine.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.130
But then we're going to Sagev.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.534
And we will find Hercules.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.568
I'll go with you.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.304
No! Tymek.
You stay with your family.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.873
Gather as many men as you can.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.042
Lead the resistance!

17:58.044 --> 18:00.912
Keep the people's hope alive.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.449
We're with you, cousin.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.250
Good Luck.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.585
All of you.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.020
And to you, Tymek.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.988
We're gonna need it.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.937
Good people of Enos!

18:26.572 --> 18:29.040
I am your new King!

18:31.276 --> 18:34.846
Where is Arias Dudunakus?

18:37.916 --> 18:42.286
Bring him forth and you will be
rewarded greatly.

18:42.288 --> 18:49.060
If you do not,
you will be punished, greatly.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.932
I assure you,
I am a man of my word.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.234
Villager: General?

18:56.869 --> 18:58.002
Sir?

18:58.704 --> 19:00.605
Your Highness.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.542
Forgive me, you Highness.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.345
I have seen your man, Arias,

19:07.347 --> 19:10.348
flee the village
with some other men at dawn.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.064
Arias!

19:28.500 --> 19:34.038
Show yourself, or I will spill this
man's blood as surely as I stand here!

19:43.115 --> 19:45.449
Your hero has left you.

19:47.953 --> 19:53.124
[Gasps/Screams]

19:53.126 --> 19:56.227
Remember this day.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.430
Remember this man's fate.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.099
Do not defy me.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.255
Horace: It's hard to believe
any Demigod would live here.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.126
He's here.
I feel it.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.464
He has to be.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.371
Where shall we start?

20:42.708 --> 20:44.308
Gentlemen.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.560
By the gods...

21:02.562 --> 21:06.998
I do not think there's any gods
in here.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.100
Maybe not even half-gods.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.402
He looks like a beast.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.404
Ask him.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.173
Perhaps he's the half god
you're looking for.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.482
We're looking for a man named
Hercules!

21:25.484 --> 21:27.518
And who might you be?

21:30.756 --> 21:33.624
I'm Arias Dudunakus from Enos.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.761
I'm looking for a man named
Hercules.

21:36.763 --> 21:41.699
I have a handsome purse for the
man who claims to know him.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.468
Anyone here named Hercules?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.239
[Slurring]
I am Hercules!

21:50.142 --> 21:52.343
[Slurring]
No! I am Hercules.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.144
You?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.879
Of course you are.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.250
I am the real Hercules!

21:59.252 --> 22:01.552
Now give me your purse.

22:01.554 --> 22:09.360
[Crowd]
I am Hercules! I am Hercules!

22:15.133 --> 22:17.401
At least you found your army.

22:17.403 --> 22:22.673
I just hope your handsome purse
can afford so many Demi-Gods.

22:24.176 --> 22:29.413
Bartender: Quiet you fools!
Spend you coins or go!

22:30.816 --> 22:38.622
[Crowd Continues]
I am Hercules. I am Hercules.

22:40.892 --> 22:44.762
Farewell, Herculeses.
It's been a pleasure.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.684
Here she is, Dominus.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.520
She's been cleaned as ordered.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.690
-Leave us.
-Yes, Dominus

23:18.397 --> 23:20.398
Sorry to put you here.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.468
It's hardly befitting
of a Queen.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.879
I will not hurt you.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.214
[Screams]
[Slaps]

23:37.216 --> 23:39.417
Never...!

23:39.419 --> 23:41.318
...do that again.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.526
You should know better
than to strike a King.

23:48.528 --> 23:51.362
You are not my King.

23:53.331 --> 23:55.433
[Whispers]
How wrong you are.

23:55.435 --> 24:00.337
Just because you push me away does not
mean I will not take what I want.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.174
You will pay for what
you have done, Nikos.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.810
By the gods,
you will pay.

24:07.712 --> 24:11.649
Your gods have no power over me.

24:12.717 --> 24:16.887
They will strike you down,
but through Arias.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.892
They will send him here
to end this and end you.

24:23.528 --> 24:25.596

Where is your Arias?

[Yelling]
Where is your Arias?

24:34.739 --> 24:37.875
I just know that he will return.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.413
Yes.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.916
He will return.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.786
Not to save you.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.489
Or his village.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.792
Or even to kill me.

24:56.695 --> 24:59.630
He will return to bow
at my feet.

25:01.900 --> 25:08.572
He will bow at my feet,
and I shall have his head.

I saw you, you stinkin' whore.

I'll be back tomorrow.

Take my hand, friend.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.863
Get away from me.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.531
You are drunk.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.533
That I am.

26:12.637 --> 26:15.839
Now leave me be,

pay your debt at the bar.

I am Hercules.

Now, give me some coins.

26:40.465 --> 26:43.734
Arias, this man
is a worthless drunk.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.604
This whole town is worthless.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.740
Come, let us find some sleep

26:49.742 --> 26:51.642
and be done with this
in the morrow.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.910

26:52.912 --> 26:56.347
We need to find Hercules
to fight General Nikos.

27:39.457 --> 27:42.559
Arias will never be as powerful
as me.

In time I will skill you,
in ways to love me.

[Gate Opens]

28:04.683 --> 28:06.817
I said not to disturb me.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.054
We know where Arias
and his men are.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.423
They left for Sagev.

is for love.

You think me incapable.

It was once one I loved
so much,

29:08.047 --> 29:10.781
when she chose another...

29:11.483 --> 29:13.917
I killed her.

They even refused us water.

tortured for information.

that you can do?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.164
If I try to help,
they'll just torture me, too.

is what Horace says he is.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.640

under these conditions.

for Enos.

reason to kill him than you.

What he's capable of.

to wine for a few hours,

38:42.521 --> 38:44.120
He seeks you, even now.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.455
He will see you dead.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.357
He's already found us once.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.092
We've been betrayed.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.061
Don't judge the people of Enos,
Horace.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.662
You have no idea
what they face.

38:52.664 --> 38:56.099
Torture. Slavery.
Nikos is a monster.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.167
And what about Theodora?

38:57.169 --> 39:00.170
Safe for now,
but he will find her.

39:00.172 --> 39:04.074
Nikos will not last.
I promise you.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.543
We found Hercules.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.412
So, the ledged is true.

I hope you are right.

Tymek, you need to go back.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.762
Do not let Nikos find Theodora.

39:25.764 --> 39:29.332
Without her, we will never gain
support of the people.

That you went mad
and murdered your family.

Yes. I am.

he was your teacher.

nothing. The past is set in stone.

57:45.996 --> 57:47.996
Like the gods.

57:47.998 --> 57:49.631
Tell me more.

57:49.633 --> 57:52.501
Well, your majesty...

57:52.503 --> 57:57.506
I'm fairly certain I heard them
say he was Hercules.

57:57.508 --> 57:58.707
Hercules.

57:58.709 --> 58:01.210
I have heard of Hercules before.

58:01.212 --> 58:03.278
I have heard that
he is half god.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.748
I assure you,
he is only a man!

58:10.720 --> 58:13.222
Indeed, he is a powerful one.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.592
I fought alongside Hercules.

58:16.594 --> 58:20.262
He's certainly no match
for you, Cyrus.

58:20.264 --> 58:23.131
I'm certain they will return
to Enos.

58:23.133 --> 58:25.968
Keep watch over Tymek,
Arias' cousin.

58:25.970 --> 58:29.671
-Yes, sir.
-He will lead us to this half god.

58:42.118 --> 58:44.520
What brings you to Enos?

58:44.522 --> 58:47.389
I've come to sell my potatoes
at the marketplace

58:47.391 --> 58:52.094
and a bit of coin for a pretty
night with some women and wine.

58:52.096 --> 58:53.795
Open it up.

58:53.797 --> 58:56.098
Its just potatoes.

58:56.100 --> 58:58.000
You look as if I lied.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.839
My potatoes! I've been robbed!

59:03.841 --> 59:06.842
[Grunts]

59:11.347 --> 59:13.815
Justice has been served.

59:37.607 --> 59:40.475
Horace: We have all served
under General Nikos

59:42.579 --> 59:45.881
And I'm telling you, the walls to
the Royal Palace are impenetrable.

59:45.883 --> 59:49.151
Arias: I say retreat, find more men,
and return to fight.

59:51.154 --> 59:53.355
Five of us against an army?

59:53.357 --> 59:55.023
That's insanity.

59:55.025 --> 59:56.758
Maybe I will have some
of that wine.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.962
Maybe you should. You could certainly
use something to find your courage.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.664
-That's certainly the hope.
-Enough!

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.100
We cannot afford to bicker.
And we cannot wait!

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.536
Hercules is right!

01:00:07.538 --> 01:00:09.938
What's there to discuss.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:15.644
Nikos killed my family. I found their
bloody bodies right there in their beds.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:20.482
I will not rest until I see his
head on a stake!

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.869
Arias!

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:42.804
We have visitors.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.416
I seek a man named Hercules!

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.452
Looks like the fight
is coming to us.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.755
Then let's go shed some blood.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.557
No! Don't!

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:05.160
We shall handle this!
How many men have you gathered?

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.796
30. Maybe 40.

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.565
The people's thirst for Nikos'
blood is rising, as is mine!

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:13.435
I am sorry about what happened
to you!

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.470
But your anger
will just get you killed.

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.407
I need you now.
The people need you!

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:21.943
Just go out the back and gather
as many men as you can.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.546
They can do this.
You can do this!

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.814
Just rise!

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.883
We shall rise!

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:36.058
By the royal order
of King Nikos,

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.660
I hereby place you under arrest.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.663
Surrender yourself, now!

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:43.165
Or die!

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.669
What shall we do?

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.707
You say the Royal Palace walls
are impenetrable.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.575
Impenetrable.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:58.680
I think we may have just found
our way in.

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:08.056
He's not talking about-- you're not talking about
what I think you're talking about, are you?

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.991
He is?

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.993
He is insane.

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:15.964
Hercules! Arias Dudunakus...

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:21.703
And your men,
surrender yourselves, now!

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.178
I am Hercules.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.951
Take us to General Nikos.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.864
Shackle them.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:58.940
The mighty Hercules.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:03.979
I was looking forward
to killing you in a battle.

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.181
Perhaps you shall have
that chance.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.150
Hmm.

01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:09.951
Perhaps.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:38.647
General Nikos is not your King!
Do not let him take your freedom!

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:42.217
Rise! You are many!
They are but a few!

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.919
They have killed
your King and Queen!

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:46.922
In honor of them,
fight!

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.557
Spread word!

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.592
I said, silence!

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.494
[Slap]
[Screams]

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.150
Theodora!

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.023
You see this toy?

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:27.863
It's all I have left of my son,
Erasmus.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:31.233
He saw slain by Nikos,
along with my wife.

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:34.636
He will do the same to you
if we do nothing.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:35.904
I was like you once.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.740
Afraid. Afraid to fight.

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:41.710
Afraid to risk my family,
but let me tell you, brothers...

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:44.913
That's exactly what you risk
when you do nothing.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.381
Arias is right.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.351
We have the numbers
in our favor, by a wide margin.

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:52.787
But you did notice that Hercules and
Arias have been lead away in chains?

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:56.391
We don't need Arias or Hercules.
We are the people!

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.026
This is our home!

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:01.863
Nikos will come for you next, and he
will kill your wife and your child.

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.298
But many of us will die, Tymek.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.333
More will die if we do nothing.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:10.205
And those that don't perish at the end of a
spear, will be enslaved in the mines forever!

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:12.274
The time to act is now.

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:14.276
By the gods!

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:15.410
Let's rise!

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:20.248

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:38.934
[Grunts]

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:08.997
I'm sorry it had to end
this way.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:11.166
You should have joined me.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.701
[Spits]

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:20.942
How long have you been planning
this?

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:25.080
I cannot believe
how blind I have been.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:26.815
Unchain me now!

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:28.149
And let's settle this
as warriors.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.085
[Slap]
[Scream]

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.287
-You're a fool!
-Do not hurt him, please--

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.322
Silence!

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:42.831
We must rise for Enos,
for your families, for your futures!

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:43.898
Rise!

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:51.539
[Cheering]
Rise!

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:56.911
Hercules, it's been many years
since our paths have crossed.

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:01.483
I do not speak to dead men.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.786
But I am alive.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:07.389
You are not long for this world.

[Grunt]

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.034
Leave him be!

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:23.104
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:24.572
What are you talking about?

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:30.145
Hercules, once and for all,
who is this man to you?

01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:37.752
[Angry Crowd Yelling]

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.563
Has he not told you?

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:53.535
I am the man
who changed his life.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:58.239
He took Magera from me.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.342
He stole my true love.

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.882
I loved her.

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.350
She never loved you.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:15.490
I saved her from you and your abuse.
You kept her as a slave.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.495
Hercules took my heart
and made me a fool.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.398
Blood of gods.

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.899
It was unbeatable.
It was unfair.

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:28.970
You did everything in your power
to ruin us.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.777
That's not all I did.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.782
Do you ever wonder what
happened that night?

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.551
Do you ever wonder...

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:47.889
Why you killed your family?

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:54.395
I had a shaman of the Goddess Hara
make a potion...

01:08:54.397 --> 01:08:57.966
not strong enough to kill you,
Hercules...

01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:00.935
to drive you mad...

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:04.572
I wanted you to drive her away,
so she would forget her love for you.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:08.042
You brought forth Magera's
blood and your children.

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:10.145
Is that what a real man does?

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:11.246
No!

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.581
Son of Zeus!

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.490
I will kill you.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:26.294
I did not kill her.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.130
You did.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.545

Now you'll see...
the true power of the potion.

- I would take arms, if I were you!

It is I! Arias!

this is going to be bad?

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:01.122
Hercules, do not let the poison
overtake you!

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:03.291
This is definitely bad!
