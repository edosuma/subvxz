00:28.000 --> 00:30.800
<i>Chapter 4. You're a disgrace.</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:36.100
<i>You're wasting my oxygen.
Get off your butt and do something.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:39.000
<i>Hey, you, stop looking
at the people around you.</i>

00:39.100 --> 00:42.200
<i>I'm talking to you,
the loser who bought this tape.</i>

00:42.300 --> 00:45.400
<i>I've had bowel movements
with more spine than you.</i>

00:46.300 --> 00:48.300
<i>Do you like coming in second place?</i>

00:48.400 --> 00:51.900
<i>Well, I don't.
And from now on, neither do you.</i>

00:51.900 --> 00:56.300
<i>Starting today, you're a winner,
and you can do it. Got it?</i>

00:56.400 --> 00:56.400
<i>I'm a winner.</i>

00:56.600 --> 01:00.000
<i>Say it like you mean it, you little Judy.</i>

01:00.800 --> 01:03.300
I am a winner.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.400
I'm a winner.
I can do it.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.700
I'm a winner. I can do it.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.500
I'm a winner.
I can do it.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.600
I'm a winner. I can do it.

01:20.700 --> 01:20.800
I'm a winner.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.900
<i>Ow!</i>

01:29.500 --> 01:32.400
Sir, I've been with this company
two and a half years now...

01:32.400 --> 01:38.300
and all I've really done
is some clerical work.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.000
<i>And, uh, I think I'm ready
for some more responsibility.</i>

01:41.199 --> 01:41.800
<i>Okay, Barker.</i>

01:43.300 --> 01:46.600
Well, what kind of responsibility
are you looking for?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.900
Look, I don't know, sir.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.700
I just... feel that
I'm being underutilized here...

01:53.800 --> 01:57.100
and I can handle a hell of a lot more
than what I've been given.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.000
I'm just looking for the chance.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.700
You know what, Barker?
Maybe you're right.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
<i>Let's do it.
Why not?</i>

02:03.900 --> 02:06.100
Let's move you upstairs,
see how you do.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.199
<i>Give you a chance.</i>

02:08.300 --> 02:11.500
Wow, thank you. Thank you very much.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.600
Uh-huh.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.900
Yeah. Yeah.
Put him through. I gotta take this.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.800
- Oh.
- Hello, Bull. Yeah, hang on.

02:22.900 --> 02:23.500
Uh, yeah, wait, Barker.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.900
Uh, do me a favor, will you,
and fire Stavi.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.200
The janitor?

02:28.700 --> 02:32.000
Yeah. Hang on.
Yeah, he's doin' a terrible job.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.300
But he's a really nice guy. I mean,
can't you give him a second chance?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.600
<i>I caught him using
my personal bathroom.</i>

02:39.800 --> 02:42.100
<i>I sat on his pee.</i>

02:42.200 --> 02:43.800
See you.
Yeah.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.200
<i>Yeah, tell him to be on time.
I'm tired of teeing off late.</i>

02:50.300 --> 02:50.400
<i>Stavi.</i>

02:51.300 --> 02:53.300
<i>Stavi.</i>

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, hello, Mr. Stevie.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.100
Did you get
the Christmas card I sent you?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.300
Yeah.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.200
Hey, listen.
I wanna talk to you for a second.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
Stavi, you don't like your job, do you?

03:11.600 --> 03:15.500
Oh, yes.
I like very much.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.700
I get to clean things.

03:16.700 --> 03:17.800
Work with my hands.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
Yeah, but you'd be happier
doing something else.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.000
I mean, you're a pretty bright guy.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.000
No. Not really.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.900
<i>Of course you are, Stavi. You got
a little bit of a language problem, but-</i>

03:31.800 --> 03:34.400
No, no.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.200
In my country,
Stavi not too bright either.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.400
Look, trust me,
you're wasting your time here.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.500
Oh, no.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.100
Oh, no.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.200
Oh, no.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.900
Stavi can't be fired.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.300
I have five kids.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.600
My wife, Betya-
She died.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.700
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.900
Stavi love her...

04:14.600 --> 04:17.600
from the depth...

04:17.899 --> 04:19.600
of his soul.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.400
- Hey, I'm not firing you.
- No?

04:25.100 --> 04:28.200
No, I'm offering you something else-
a better job.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.800
Stavi listening.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.200
Would you like to mow the lawn
at my apartment complex?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.500
I can do lawns.
How much I get?

04:39.600 --> 04:40.000
How much you get here?

04:40.700 --> 04:43.200
350 a week.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.700
I can match it.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.400
Tempting.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.800
But...

04:51.800 --> 04:54.900
I have so many memories here.

04:55.000 --> 04:55.600
Four hundred?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.900
And health benefits?

04:58.100 --> 05:00.100
I can't really swing health benefits.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.900
Please, Mr. Stevie.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.100
I need health benefits.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.300
I have big family.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.600
You got 'em.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.200
Come on.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.400
Ew.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.700
It's okay. It's not that big of a deal.

05:54.700 --> 05:58.000
Somebody help me!
I got a bag of fingers here! Shh!

06:01.600 --> 06:03.900
<i>My fingers!</i>

06:04.000 --> 06:06.300
Keep it elevated.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.400
- Nurse!
- Excuse me, sir. I can help you.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.000
Who's Mr. Simicek's employer?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.600
- Me.
- I'm Dr. Ahmed...

06:13.600 --> 06:16.000
head of reconstructive surgical group.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Uh, good news.
We can save his fingers.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.900
- Thank you.
- Just a few questions-

06:24.000 --> 06:26.300
What health plan is he on?

06:26.300 --> 06:28.600
It doesn't say here anything.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.200
Uh...

06:33.500 --> 06:35.700
he's not on one yet.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.200
He's not on an HMO?

06:38.300 --> 06:40.300
How about Medicaid?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.800
He doesn't have it.
He's not a citizen.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.800
Ooh!
Well, in that case...

06:48.600 --> 06:52.300
you will need to cover
the cost of the surgery up front.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.300
Well, how much is it?

06:55.400 --> 06:59.000
$28,000,
not including the anesthesia.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.400
I don't have that kind of money.

06:59.500 --> 07:04.000
Well, I'm sorry, sir. As much as
I'd like to help, I can't do the surgery.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.000
- What?
- Look, you don't have insurance.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.400
You don't have any funds.

07:08.900 --> 07:12.400
There's no way my hospital
can absorb that kind of risk.

07:13.900 --> 07:14.500
How long do I have
to raise the money?

07:16.700 --> 07:20.400
Well, if I put the fingers on ice,
they can last for a couple of weeks.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.300
After that, it's not doable.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.900
I'm sorry, sir.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.100
But, Doc.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.100
<i>Come on, Krysinszi. Make this field goal.</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:43.600
Dear God, if he puts it
through the uprights...

07:43.900 --> 07:46.300
I promise, no more massages
with happy endings.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.600
Here's the kick.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.900
Oh, thank you, God!
I put out to you, you dump on me.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.600
Yo.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.200
Uncle Gary, it's Steve.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.000
Hey... shitbird.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
Look, I hate to bother you,
but, uh...

08:01.200 --> 08:03.100
I was calling you
about that, uh...

08:03.600 --> 08:06.100
1,500 I loaned you
a couple years ago.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.000
Loan?
I thought it was a gift.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.500
No.
That was definitely a loan.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.400
- I already paid you.
- No, you didn't.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.600
What do you need 1,500 for?
You got a job.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.500
Well, actually, uh, I need 28 grand.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.300
28 grand? What did you do,
knock up a cheerleading squad?

08:22.400 --> 08:26.000
It's just a stupid thing.
My friend got his fingers cut off, and-

08:26.100 --> 08:28.400
Listen, I'd really like to
help you out with this 1,500...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.000
but, you know,
you got me at a bad time now.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.700
Shit. Gotta go.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.700
Don't do-

08:37.700 --> 08:39.799
You owe me $40,000...

08:39.799 --> 08:43.000
which I, as a friend, took
your word that you would pay.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.200
- And you haven't.
- I will, Michael. I will. I promise.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.100
I've got something working now.
I promise-

08:51.000 --> 08:53.500
You know something?
You talk too much.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.300
<i> A lot of people say
one thing we don't have today is heroes.</i>

08:58.300 --> 08:59.500
Hey, Michael.
That guy you like's on TV.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.300
His name is Jimmy Washington...

09:04.800 --> 09:07.800
<i>but to those who follow
Special Olympics...</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:09.300
he's known by one simple word-
champion.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.100
You see, Jimmy has won
the last six Special Olympics pentathlons.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Incredible.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.800
That guy's
the Deion Sanders of retards.

09:19.900 --> 09:24.300
<i>I like to run
and train hard for events...</i>

09:25.000 --> 09:26.100
and get to show I can do anything.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
When people tell me I'm good...

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
I feel good.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.800
I feel like a happy person.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.400
I feel just like all of you.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.600
I love that kid.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.100
Hmm?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.300
<i>Who is it?</i>

10:08.400 --> 10:10.700
<i>It's Paris Hilton.</i>

10:16.000 --> 10:18.300
You have intimacy problems.
You know that?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything. I want to help you.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.100
I don't have any pot.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.400
I don't want pot!
I've got good news for you.

10:31.400 --> 10:31.400
You said you had
money problems, right?

10:31.400 --> 10:34.700
<i>- Right.
- Well, so do I, but it's all gonna be over.</i>

10:35.700 --> 10:37.700
Wanna know how?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.500
How?

10:40.700 --> 10:44.900
We are gonna fix
the Special Olympics.

10:44.900 --> 10:45.600
Hmm?

10:48.400 --> 10:51.300
Special Olympics.
We're gonna rig it.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.800
You and me.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.700
You want to fix
the Special Olympics?

11:02.600 --> 11:05.400
You know what, Uncle Gary?
I'm gonna get you a little coffee.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.700
I'm not that drunk.
There's this kid Jimmy.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.600
Wins all the time.
No one can beat him, right? Wrong! You can.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.500
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.</i>

11:12.700 --> 11:14.800
You ran track in high school.
You were state champion.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.000
- Division D champion.
- Whatever!

11:18.100 --> 11:22.100
You were a great athlete, and you were
the best kid in your drama class every year.

11:22.100 --> 11:22.900
I was so proud of you.
I kept a scrapbook.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.500
- No, you didn't.
- In my heart, I did.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.100
<i>You were a great actor.
You were the best.</i>

11:29.600 --> 11:32.600
You could imitate anybody.
Your Diana Ross- a riot.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.500
We all thought you'd end up
in Hollywood bangin' starlets by now.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.500
Well, that dream didn't work out
too good, now, did it?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.100
Look, sit.
Listen to your uncle.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.200
The preliminaries
are being held here in three days.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.600
All you have to do
is act like one of them.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.900
Not exactly a major stretch for you.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.700
We get you in, you get into the nationals,
I bet 100 on you, we clean up...

11:52.700 --> 11:54.100
your friend gets his fingers back.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.800
Who's gonna take that bet?
Vegas?

11:58.900 --> 12:00.300
I know someone who will.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.200
<i>- No. I can't.
- Aw, come on.</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:07.400
A normal guy against
a bunch of feebs?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.300
You'll look like
Carl freakin' Lewis out there.

12:11.700 --> 12:15.900
I am not fixing the Special Olympics.
It's wrong!

12:18.200 --> 12:21.700
- Hello.
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.500
Your friend Stavi won't have any
health benefits. That's what's wrong!

12:26.400 --> 12:28.500
- Look, I wanna help, but-
- But what?

12:28.500 --> 12:32.300
The guy's wife is dead. You think a guy
with no fingers is gonna find another woman?

12:33.000 --> 12:37.300
Even worse, when he comes home by himself,
he won't even be able to jerk off properly...

12:37.700 --> 12:39.700
because you robbed
that man of his dignity!

12:39.700 --> 12:43.600
Look, get it through your head.
I am not fixing the Special Olympics.

12:44.900 --> 12:45.800
Hi, guys.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.700
Hi.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.900
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.200
- How you feelin'?
- Not too bad, Mr. Stevie.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.900
Were you able to straighten out
the insurance glitch?

13:02.700 --> 13:04.700
Yeah, it's, uh,
comin' along really good.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.900
It's okay if you don't get insurance.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.100
<i>Stavi don't need all his fingers.</i>

13:09.800 --> 13:11.800
No, you need 'em, Stavi.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.600
No, No, it's okay.
I look on my bright side.

13:14.900 --> 13:20.200
With not so many fingers, when I do
the gardening, I don't crush the flowers.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.300
I can pick them easy.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
God always have a plan.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.400
Look, I promise you
I'm gonna get your fingers back for you.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.800
You're a good man, Mr. Stevie.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.900
<i>Uh-uh, Stavi Three.
Not a hugger.</i>

13:39.100 --> 13:39.800
Mm-mm.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.400
Children, give Mr. Stevie
a Stavi good-bye.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.200
Bye, Stavi.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.800
Poor Stavi. He trusted you.
He believed in you.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.100
He literally gave you
his hand in friendship.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.000
Did you know that man's dream
was to play the flamenco guitar?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.400
Okay.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I'll rig the Special Olympics.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.100
Thank you.
Finally, a little humanity.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.900
It doesn't take
a smart man to know what love is.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.200
I love you, Jenny.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.600
Okay, now you try.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.400
Try what?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.600
Acting like that.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.100
Come on, man.
Start taking this seriously.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.200
Okay.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.400
I love you, Jenny.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.700
Hey, hey!
Commit.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.700
<i>- I love you, Jenny.
- Better. Better.</i>

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
Something's missing.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
You should drool.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.300
Okay, Uncle Gary.
There you go. Good night.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.500
Exciting.
Isn't it exciting?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.700
- What?
- You're acting again.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

15:05.700 --> 15:08.000
We gotta come up with a slogan.

15:08.100 --> 15:11.700
A slogan, you know, like, uh,
"Life is like a box of chocolates."

15:11.700 --> 15:14.700
<i>Or, "Take my hands, boss,"
like that monster tard from The Green Mile.</i>

15:15.100 --> 15:17.900
"Monster tard"?
What's wrong with you?

15:18.100 --> 15:21.600
What? Since when did "tard"
become politically incorrect?

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
Good night, Uncle Gary.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.300
I'm going to hell.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.000
My name is Lance,
and I like nuts.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.300
My name is Arthel,
and I can count to potato.

15:34.500 --> 15:39.000
Hi, my name is Jerome.
Can I have a slice of your doodie?

15:49.100 --> 15:53.800
Hello, my name is Jeffy,
and I like to eat apples.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.600
Boogie-woogie.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.200
Whoo-hoo!

16:17.700 --> 16:19.700
<i>You take care of work like I told you?</i>

16:19.800 --> 16:21.800
<i>Yeah, I got two weeks off.</i>

16:21.900 --> 16:25.100
<i>- I told them my Uncle Gary just died.
- Oh, that's sweet.</i>

16:26.300 --> 16:30.000
<i>Come on, now.
Let's not be antisocial.</i>

16:49.300 --> 16:50.500
Hi!
My name is Glen.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.200
Guess how many fingers I have.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
- Ten.
- No. No. No.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.100
I have eight fingers,
and I have two thumbs.

16:59.100 --> 17:02.900
- Oh, that's good. An oldie, but good. Come on.
- Guess what! Guess what!

17:02.900 --> 17:02.900
- What?
- I work at Burger King.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.800
Do you want fries with that?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.599
What's your name?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Uh, Steve. Uh, Jeffy.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
J-Jeffy.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.500
You talk funny.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
That's 'cause he's Canadian.
Come on.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.300
Hey, you know who else is Canadian?
Bill Shatner.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
- That's right. Keep walkin'.
- Yeah, T.J. Hooker.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.400
And Jim Carrey, the sad clown.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.599
And Alan Thicke-
Never got him.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.500
And also Dave Thomas-
Not the Wendy's guy, but the other one.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.500
And Alanis Morissette.
She has issues.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.800
Hi! My name's Glen.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.300
<i>Oh, God, this is wrong.</i>

17:36.500 --> 17:39.200
- Oh, calm down.
- This is so wrong.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.600
Will you calm down?

17:41.700 --> 17:44.000
Look, I can't do this.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.500
- You have to. Come on.
- No. Don't make me do this.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.700
- Come on.
- No. No.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.200
Oh!

17:53.300 --> 17:56.800
<i>Oh! Oh!
Are you all right?</i>

17:57.100 --> 17:58.900
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

17:59.700 --> 18:01.500
<i>- No.
- Are you all right?</i>

18:01.600 --> 18:04.000
<i>- Yes.
- You sure? Need a hand up?</i>

18:08.600 --> 18:10.200
You need a hand up?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.600
No! Hey!

18:13.900 --> 18:15.900
Hurt? Hey! No!

18:15.900 --> 18:17.600
You're gonna take just a minute.
You're fine?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.300
Oh, you got some schmutz on you.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.000
I'm Lynn.
What's your name?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.600
- I'm-
- What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.300
His name's Jeffy.
He's just a little shy.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.000
I mean, you know how they are.
God bless 'em.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.700
Cat got my tongue.
Cat got my- Cat got my tongue!

18:36.500 --> 18:38.700
Yeah, it's a really stupid expression.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.400
It sounds like a bad Dr. Seuss title.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.300
Are you his guardian?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Yeah. Yeah.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.300
It's tough, but, you know, someone's
gotta feed him, change his underwear...

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
show him how to play
with his puppets.

18:53.900 --> 18:58.700
- Yeah. Do you have his medical release forms?
- Huh?

18:59.100 --> 19:02.900
Well, we require medical release forms
for all the athletes.

19:03.900 --> 19:04.900
Paper's at home.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.600
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.200
- I got all that stuff. It's at home.
- Oh.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.500
Sorry.
I swear...

19:11.600 --> 19:14.900
sometimes I think I'm the one
who should be wearin' the helmet to bed.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.300
<i>Please. Please.</i>

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Don't let the little guy suffer
because of my mistake.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.100
I mean, look at him.
Look at him.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.200
He's got his heart set on competing.
Don't you, Jeffy?

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
Go for gold!

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
Ha ha ! Go for gold !

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
All right.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.100
I'll let it slide for now.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.600
Jeffy, do you wanna grab a POWERade
or a granola bar or something?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.700
- I just need to talk to your guardian.
- Be a good boy, okay?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.500
<i>To place him
in the appropriate events...</i>

19:43.500 --> 19:47.000
I'm just gonna need to know
his qualifying times and his diagnosis.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.000
Well, he's slow.
Real slow.

19:51.100 --> 19:51.600
Uh, Jeffy want a V-8.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.200
Okay.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.700
You should see him trying to
eat a watermelon.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.300
Uh, I'm sorry.
I mean his medical diagnosis.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.900
Well, you know, Lynn...

20:06.400 --> 20:08.300
technically,
I'm not a doctor, but...

20:08.800 --> 20:11.100
<i>it's a huge Latin word.</i>

20:11.300 --> 20:14.000
Uh, "Symptomus Moronicus."
Uh-

20:14.000 --> 20:17.400
Jeffy highly functioning
developmentally disabled.

20:17.500 --> 20:21.100
All right! Nice, Jeffy.
Good for you!

20:21.800 --> 20:24.400
All right. Well, let's just go sign in,
shall we?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.600
Good-bye, Uncle Gary.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.800
- Very nice, Troy. Very nice, Rudy.
- I think I got it.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
- Good job, you guys.
- Hey, Lynn.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.300
- Hey, you stayin' out of trouble, Winston?
- No.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.500
Yeah. Come on over this way.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.900
We're going to this room over here.

20:57.900 --> 20:58.400
Let's see if Billy is in.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.800
Hey, Billy,
your roommate is finally here.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.300
Hi.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.300
Lynn, a man wants to see you.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.600
Oh, thank you. Okay.
Well, I'll just let you two get acquainted.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.000
My name's Jeffy.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.900
So, you workin'
on the computer there?

21:31.000 --> 21:31.900
No, I'm walking my dog.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.400
Oh.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.100
"Kids of Widney High."

21:45.400 --> 21:47.900
<i>What are they,
like 'N Sync or something?</i>

21:48.000 --> 21:49.400
Oh!

21:52.400 --> 21:54.400
Scratch!

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
Scratch!

21:56.900 --> 21:59.600
Oh, my stars!
For the love of Liza!

21:59.700 --> 22:01.700
You scratched my CD!

22:03.500 --> 22:05.500
<i>Why'd you scratch his CD?</i>

22:06.300 --> 22:08.000
Uh, Jeffy just admiring it.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.200
<i>Do it again,
and you'll be admiring my butt...</i>

22:12.300 --> 22:14.500
<i>from the pavement with a straw.</i>

22:15.800 --> 22:18.500
- What?
- You heard me.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.500
Thanks, Mark.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
Asshole.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.500
Billy, Jeffy sorry...

22:34.900 --> 22:37.500
<i>about the whole CD incident.</i>

22:37.600 --> 22:39.600
You scratched my CD, you know.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.000
I know, and I'm really sorry.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.500
You scratched it.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.100
You picked it up in clear daylight
and you scratched it.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.200
I know. You know,
we've established that.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.600
Hey, don't give me 'tude.

22:54.700 --> 22:57.300
You scratched my CD, Tex.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.300
Billy, if you'll listen to me,
I'm clearly not disputing that.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.900
<i>- I'm just trying to apologize.
- Tut, tut, tut. Bye-bye.</i>

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That's my chair.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.300
Come on! Get up, get up, get up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

23:27.100 --> 23:28.600
<i>So there are five events
in the pentathlon.</i>

23:29.100 --> 23:32.400
We're gonna try you out in each of them
so we can assess your ability...

23:32.400 --> 23:33.600
and see which athletes
to put you with at the games.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.800
- Can I be with Jimmy?
- Pardon?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.100
Jimmy from TV.
Jeffy big fan.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.100
You can be with Jimmy
as long as you finish in the top eight.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.700
But hey, if you don't,
I'll still love you.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.500
Okay, so here is
the 100-meter dash...

23:47.800 --> 23:50.400
and this is your first event,
so good luck.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.200
Jeffy, the race.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.700
- Jeffy forgot.
- All right.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.200
Well, go for it.
Good luck.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.100
<i>On your mark!
Set!</i>

24:14.600 --> 24:18.700
- Good luck.
- I don't need luck, ugly. Rudy beat your butt!

24:44.100 --> 24:47.800
<i> Runners, line up
for the last race of the day-</i>

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
<i>the 400-meter dash...</i>

24:49.700 --> 24:52.400
<i>which will determine the final divisions.</i>

24:59.600 --> 25:01.600
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

25:04.000 --> 25:08.500
<i>Oh! There you go!
Oh! Oh! Go, go, go, go!</i>

25:18.400 --> 25:21.000
Great job, Jeffy.
You finished eighth in the competition.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.000
You get to go to the finals with Jimmy.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.500
I'm very proud of you.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.000
I'm very proud of you.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.700
- Good thinkin', pal.
- Huh?

25:27.800 --> 25:29.800
Holdin' back and lettin'
seven others beat you.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.800
Nice touch.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.900
- You wanna bet on the Special Olympics?
- Why not? It's sports.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.200
Get this piece of crap out of here.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.800
Look, look, look.
I owe you 40 grand, right?

25:45.400 --> 25:50.900
Well, a hundred grand says that Jimmy
is not gonna win the next Special Olympics.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.300
Can you believe this guy?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.900
He can't come up with my 40 G's...

25:56.100 --> 25:58.000
and now wants to bet a hundred G's.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.200
I'll put up my house.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
- You have a home?
- Yeah. Under the freeway.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.500
Let me get this straight.
You wanna bet against the great Jimmy?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.100
- Uh-huh.
- You know something?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.600
You're sick.
You need help.

26:12.100 --> 26:17.200
But I'll tell you what.
Before you get help, I'll take your house.

26:18.300 --> 26:21.400
Come on, athletes!
Only eight days to go till the games.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.800
Let's go! Come on.
I wanna see you beat those entry scores.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.900
Two more laps.
Let's go, guys. Like a champion.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.900
<i>Come on now!
Move it out!</i>

26:36.900 --> 26:37.600
Hi!

26:39.200 --> 26:42.600
My name is Thomas.
What's your name?

26:42.900 --> 26:43.300
Jeffy.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.600
Um, tomorrow,
I gonna talk to Karen.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.400
She's a real good swimmer,
and she can jump high too.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.900
Um, and, um,
did I tell you I got a watch?

26:54.900 --> 26:59.600
My aunt sent it to me.
Not my aunt Helen, my aunt Ruth.

26:59.900 --> 27:02.000
And, um, when I talk to Karen...

27:02.200 --> 27:06.400
should I wear my shirt up,
like this, or down?

27:06.500 --> 27:06.800
Or-Or up?

27:10.200 --> 27:13.400
Or possibly...

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
tucked in?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.800
I don't know, man.
Wear it like you're wearin' it. You look great.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.200
What's that?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.700
It's Jimmy!

27:46.300 --> 27:47.200
Jimmy!

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
Can I have an autograph please?

27:51.800 --> 27:54.500
- Get it off eBay.
- Who is eBay?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.100
<i>How much until you guys
are really happy?</i>

28:10.300 --> 28:12.200
Sorry.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.500
Ignore.
He has issues.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.600
- My name is Glen.
- Yeah.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.500
- Hey, guess how many fingers I have.
- Eight.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.800
<i>There you go. Next.</i>

28:42.700 --> 28:44.000
Wow.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.800
These days always so brutal?

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
Good catchin' up with you.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.700
Hi, Sally.
Looking very hot today.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.300
Is that a new hairnet?

29:00.800 --> 29:06.000
Oh, Mylanta.
You are my woman.

29:07.300 --> 29:07.900
She's nice.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.000
I once met a girl speed dating.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.900
We almost went out
for a whole minute.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.100
This is my Doberman, Candy.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.300
He usually doesn't bite me...

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
only sometimes,
although, he does.

29:26.200 --> 29:32.000
Uh, Glen, could you pass
the ketchup please?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.300
Uh-huh.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
Glen, can you pass the ketchup?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.200
Uh-huh.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.300
Yes, I could.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.700
Whoa!

29:58.900 --> 30:01.000
<i>You asked if I could
pass the ketchup.</i>

30:01.100 --> 30:04.300
You didn't ask if I would!
You didn't ask if I would!

30:07.400 --> 30:10.400
<i>You didn't ask if I would! </i>

30:10.400 --> 30:14.400
Guess what! Guess what!
I work at Burger King!

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
You mentioned that.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.500
But if you would pass the ketchup,
I would really appreciate it.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
You talk different.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.000
What do you mean?

30:30.100 --> 30:34.200
- You do talk different.
- Jeffy talks the same.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.200
You talk different
than you did before.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.300
Why do you talk different
than you did before?

30:38.400 --> 30:42.500
- Jeffy talks the same.
- No. You talk different than you did.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.500
<i>- Am not!
- Oh, yes you are!</i>

30:45.500 --> 30:47.000
And one time
he talked one way...

30:47.100 --> 30:49.500
<i>and now he-
now he talked the other way.</i>

30:50.400 --> 30:52.400
<i>- Exactly!
- Is there a problem, you guys?</i>

30:52.700 --> 30:55.600
Jeffy talked different
than he did before!

30:56.000 --> 30:59.800
Jeffy just wanted some ketchup,
and Jeffy wanted an apple, and, uh-

31:01.600 --> 31:03.500
Can I have a hug?

31:03.700 --> 31:06.900
- Sure. Sounds the same to me, guys.
- Could have fooled me.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.800
Watch out for this wisenheimer, Jeffy.
He can be trouble.

31:38.700 --> 31:43.300
Oh! Remember last year when we
were walking and then you barfed?

31:43.400 --> 31:45.800
That's cause I had spicy clams.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.900
Yeah. And then you didn't
wake me up on time...

31:48.000 --> 31:49.900
<i>so I didn't have lunch,
I had breakfast.</i>

31:50.200 --> 31:53.300
You know what?
I'm gonna go say hi. I'll see you later.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.900
Jeffy, want some company?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.800
How's it going?

32:00.700 --> 32:02.700
Uh...

32:03.100 --> 32:03.600
guess how many fingers I have.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.500
- Ten?
- No. I got eight, and two thumbs.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.500
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?

32:13.100 --> 32:15.100
Uh, nothing.
Uh, why?

32:15.800 --> 32:19.600
Well, I thought
maybe you and I could do something.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.900
Me and you?

32:23.300 --> 32:25.700
Yeah, I thought
maybe we could have lunch.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.600
Jeffy could maybe fit you in.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.900
Okay, great.
So I'll see you at 1:00? Okay?

32:31.100 --> 32:32.400
- Yeah.
- Cool. I'll see you.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.100
- Hey, Jeffy.
- Hi, Lynn.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.700
- How are you?
- Good.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.200
Good.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.200
I want you to meet my fiancé.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.600
How you doin'?
I'm David Patrick.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.500
- What's your name?
- Jeffy.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.300
Oh, it's Jeffy.
Yeah, Jeffy.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.800
I like Jeffy.
Jeffy's a good name.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.400
What's your last name?

33:00.400 --> 33:04.100
Um...

33:04.200 --> 33:04.800
Uh-

33:07.200 --> 33:08.900
You must have a last name.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.800
Jeffy, you know your last name.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.900
No. Jeffy mentally challenged.
Remember?

33:12.900 --> 33:17.100
I know it. Your uncle wrote it on your forms.
It's Dahmor. Jeffy Dahmor.

33:19.100 --> 33:19.700
With an "O."

33:19.800 --> 33:21.700
Oh.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.600
Well, that's great.
Listen, we have some reservations.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.000
- So let's hit the road. Okay, Jeffy?
- Gonna sit in back?

33:38.300 --> 33:41.100
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Yolie along.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.700
I know how hard it is
to meet new people at these things.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.500
Don't worry.
Just be yourself. It's cool.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.100
Hey, Jeffy, did you know
that Yolie is from Seattle?

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
I hear it rains in Seattle.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.000
Sometimes.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.600
<i>I hear they got coffee there too.</i>

34:10.600 --> 34:14.100
Yes, they have
all the major beverages.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.600
You know, I heard that.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.000
<i>Oh, you know, I heard
a great joke today.</i>

34:20.100 --> 34:23.800
This woman took her grandson to the beach,
and while she's snoozing in the sand...

34:23.900 --> 34:27.000
this huge wave comes
and sweeps the boy out to sea.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.699
- So he's out there thrashing-
- Honey.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.600
That's not really appropriate.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.100
You know what it's like
when you're trying to tell a joke.

34:35.199 --> 34:40.199
<i>We'll be through with lunch
by the time she gets to the punch line.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:42.400
<i>Right?
Hey, I have one.</i>

34:42.500 --> 34:45.199
It's really funny,
and it's appropriate for everyone.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.800
What time is it
when you have to go to the dentist?

34:53.000 --> 34:53.400
Hmm?

34:53.400 --> 34:55.400
"Tooth hurty."

35:00.000 --> 35:01.900
It's a bit of a thinker.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.700
And really, really old.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.700
Hey, can I take your order?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.500
- Oh, uh, why don't you guys go first?
- Yeah, absolutely.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.500
<i>I'll have a salad
and some lime Jell-O.</i>

35:12.100 --> 35:14.400
All righty.
And for you?

35:14.500 --> 35:17.300
<i>- Um, I'll have the ribs.
- Ribs?</i>

35:17.300 --> 35:20.300
Uh, hold on there, cowboy.
That could get kind of messy.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.500
Do you have anything else
that's a little cleaner?

35:24.100 --> 35:25.800
You know, we have
some really good chicken fingers.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.700
No, no, no.
He can handle the ribs. Have the ribs.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.600
Ribs.
I want the ribs.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.100
Ribs.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.600
So, I was workin'
in this Baskin-Robbins one summer.

35:39.600 --> 35:43.100
Jeffy found a $20 bill in the john.

35:43.100 --> 35:46.700
<i>And I was happy.
You know, really happy.</i>

35:46.700 --> 35:51.000
'Cause this is the first time
that Jeffy ever caught a break.

35:52.100 --> 35:52.900
Here, fishies.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.600
But then I came to find out
I had a hole in my pocket.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.700
<i>It was Jeffy's $20 bill.</i>

36:04.100 --> 36:07.500
- Yeah, we got that. Excuse me.
Gotta go to the restroom.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.100
Oh, I'll go with you.
You know what they say about us gals.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.900
We always travel in pairs.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.100
Quite a girl, isn't she, Jeffy?

36:19.100 --> 36:21.400
Lynn's fantastic.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.200
I was actually talking about Yolie.
But thanks, Jeffy.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.900
So how is everything?
Looks like you did a number on those ribs there.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.200
- They're delicious.
- How do you all know each other?

36:33.700 --> 36:36.400
Oh, he's in Special Olympics.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.500
Go on.
Tell her, Jeffy.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.700
I'm in Special Olympics.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.400
That's so sweet of you
to get involved.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.700
See, I admire the hell
out of these guys...

36:49.700 --> 36:52.100
all the challenges
they have to overcome.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.600
You know, I've been helping
Jeffy here train for years.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.800
<i> You know,
I'd love to do something like that.</i>

36:55.600 --> 37:00.800
- How would I get involved?
- Brandi? Is that your name?

37:01.300 --> 37:03.300
<i>- Yeah.
- Brandi. I'd love to do that.</i>

37:03.300 --> 37:05.600
<i>- Give me your number, and I'll hook you up.
- Sure.</i>

37:09.000 --> 37:12.400
I'm sorry it didn't work out
between the two of you.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.000
I know how hard it can be
to make new friends.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.800
That's why I was so glad when I met David.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.200
What? You don't like David?

37:20.300 --> 37:24.000
David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

37:25.000 --> 37:25.800
What do you mean?

37:26.200 --> 37:29.100
David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.700
Well, but how is he
when Lynn's not around?

37:33.000 --> 37:36.600
David poke Jeffy in the chest
and call him stupid.

37:38.400 --> 37:38.700
What?

37:39.600 --> 37:43.000
Why would-
Why would he poke you?

37:43.200 --> 37:47.700
Jeffy's fault.
Jeffy drank Coke wrong and spill on David.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.800
But David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.900
Hello, Thomas.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.900
What's goin' on, guys?

38:05.100 --> 38:07.100
You are so busted.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.100
- You're a faker!
- A mother faker!

38:12.200 --> 38:15.300
Jeffy doesn't understand.
Jeffy cocoa for Cuckoo Puffs.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.900
<i>Shut up with that,
you stupid A-S-S.</i>

38:17.900 --> 38:21.300
<i>- Yeah, we know you're not special.
- Yeah.</i>

38:21.400 --> 38:26.700
- You think you can fool us? "My name is Jeffy."
- Jeffy likes apples.

38:27.300 --> 38:27.800
"Can I have a hug?"

38:27.800 --> 38:30.900
I've seen better acting on pornos.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.900
<i>- You lay it on too thick.
- Yeah. We do that too...</i>

38:34.000 --> 38:35.200
when we want things.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.700
Show him what you did last year
when Pamela Anderson came to see us.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.400
Hey, not so aggressive.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.700
<i>- It took Pamela longer to catch on.
- Yeah.</i>

38:54.400 --> 38:55.800
I'm sorry, guys.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.300
It was wrong of me
to try and fool you.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.600
Duh.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
Why would you do
something like that?

39:06.800 --> 39:11.100
You got no idea
what kind of pressure I'm under.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.100
What's that mean, Jeffy?

39:14.100 --> 39:15.000
I-

39:16.200 --> 39:18.600
It's not Jeffy,
it's Steve.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.000
And it's a long story.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.200
<i>What happened was that...</i>

39:23.500 --> 39:25.800
I work with this guy named Stavi...

39:25.800 --> 39:29.600
and I was sent to fire him,
and I couldn't.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.400
And that's how I got here.

39:36.500 --> 39:41.800
- What?
- Do you know what he's talking about?

39:41.800 --> 39:47.000
- I'm baffled, Jeffy.
- It's not Jeffy. It's Steve.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.800
Oh!

39:48.800 --> 39:51.700
<i>- He's Steve, not Jeffy.
- Yeah.</i>

39:51.900 --> 39:54.000
I thought you said
your name was Stavi.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.800
No.
I'm Steve, not Stavi.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.600
- Just get your story straight.
- Stavi lost his fingers.

40:01.200 --> 40:05.600
<i>Does he have insurance?
Medicare, Medicaid or...</i>

40:05.600 --> 40:07.300
Aflac?

40:08.900 --> 40:11.700
No, he doesn't have
Medicare, Medicaid or "Aflac."

40:11.700 --> 40:12.400
That's why I'm in this position.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400
Okay, guys.
Let me do this again.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.500
I wanna start from the beginning.

40:16.900 --> 40:20.900
Stavi worked for me, all right?
And he lost his fingers.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.400
So, in summation-

40:23.900 --> 40:26.800
Hey, Rudy, come on.
Stick with me here.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.000
Okay, okay.
Wrap it up.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.000
Stavi is the guy
who lost his fingers...

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
and I needed money
so I could get 'em sewn back on.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.900
And that's why I, uh, did this.

40:43.000 --> 40:43.900
<i>Wow!</i>

40:45.200 --> 40:47.500
Poor Stavi!

40:47.600 --> 40:49.700
Boy, Steve, you really
screwed that guy over.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.300
<i>What-
What made you think you could win?</i>

40:57.600 --> 41:00.000
Well, I actually ran track
in high school...

41:00.000 --> 41:02.400
and I was division champion
in the 800 meters.

41:03.300 --> 41:09.200
- What was your best time?
- Uh, 2:02, 2:03.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.700
All right, then. I'm gonna be goin'.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.200
Wait.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.200
What-
What are you doing?

41:25.400 --> 41:28.400
- I'm packing.
- Why?

41:26.900 --> 41:30.600
'Cause you guys are right.
I'm a faker.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.100
We want you to stay.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.900
Yeah, right.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.400
We're serious.

41:45.900 --> 41:46.600
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:46.700 --> 41:50.300
- Yeah, we're sick of Jimmy winning all the time.
- Jimmy's a prick.

41:50.300 --> 41:54.500
Oh, God. We're sick and tired
of seeing his mug on TV.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.600
<i>Dateline. Wheaties.</i>

41:57.900 --> 42:00.300
<i>Yeah, last week,
he was on According to Jim.</i>

42:00.400 --> 42:03.400
<i>Let's be fair.
That was a good episode.</i>

42:03.500 --> 42:05.300
You guys think I can beat him?

42:04.300 --> 42:08.400
- I didn't say that.
- Maybe.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.700
But you have to start trying.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.300
- I am.
- You're at the top level here.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.600
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Lynn.</i>

42:25.600 --> 42:28.100
- Hi, Lynn.
- Hello.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.200
Listen, I hate to break this up,
but, um...

42:30.200 --> 42:32.500
I need to have a talk with Jeffy.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.900
Okay.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.300
What's this about?

42:43.400 --> 42:45.000
Hi, David.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.600
Hey, Jeffy.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.200
Come on over here.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.600
Jeffy, I was a little troubled by our talk,
so I called David-

42:52.600 --> 42:54.800
- This isn't necessary, Lynn.
- It is, honey.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.500
He should learn
not to say hurtful things.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.200
Jeffy, did David really poke you?

43:00.600 --> 43:05.100
- No.
- Then why did you say that?

43:07.700 --> 43:10.200
Jeffy a small person.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.800
Well, I think you should
apologize to David now.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.100
Honey, he really doesn't have to.

43:17.300 --> 43:19.300
Well, only if you want to.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.400
- Jeffy want to.
- Great.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.900
- That's very mature of you.
- Absolutely.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
Hey! Are you okay?

43:34.900 --> 43:36.900
- Jeffy wanna go.
- Okay.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.200
I didn't do anything.

43:47.700 --> 43:50.200
Get up, Steve.
It's Uncle Glen.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.000
Get up!

43:54.400 --> 43:56.400
Oh, it's 3:00 a.m.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.500
<i>Time to practice, butt-face.</i>

43:59.600 --> 44:01.700
Only a week to get you in shape.

44:01.700 --> 44:05.200
Come on.
Ten more minutes, guys.

44:12.000 --> 44:12.900
Come on, Steve. Run.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.700
Oh!

44:21.300 --> 44:22.700
<i>If you want a better jump...</i>

44:22.800 --> 44:25.500
you gotta push off your plant foot.

44:25.500 --> 44:26.800
Come on, Jeffy.
Push it!

44:30.000 --> 44:30.700
<i>Damn!</i>

44:29.100 --> 44:32.700
He's gonna be a real project,
isn't he?

44:32.700 --> 44:34.600
<i>You can say that again.</i>

44:36.100 --> 44:40.600
He's gonna be a real project, isn't he?

44:43.300 --> 44:44.700
Whoa!

44:54.600 --> 44:56.100
Ah, he stinks out loud.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.800
Protein shake.
Drink up.

45:04.800 --> 45:08.000
Oh, God!
What was in that?

45:08.100 --> 45:11.100
Milk, eggs and meat.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.100
- What kind of meat?
- Raw.

45:14.700 --> 45:19.600
<i>Hey!
These are my good shoes!</i>

45:19.700 --> 45:20.300
Whoa!

45:22.900 --> 45:25.900
Hey, guys,
how's this helping me win the race?

45:26.900 --> 45:29.500
You know, he raises a good point.

45:31.900 --> 45:32.500
Special Olympics!

45:32.600 --> 45:34.400
Whoa!

46:00.800 --> 46:02.900
How's a blindfold
gonna help me run faster?

46:03.000 --> 46:04.400
Take it off, and I'll show you.

46:09.700 --> 46:11.600
Sic him, Killer. Get the bad man.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.900
- Go get him!
- Yeah! Yeah!

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
<i>That's a vast improvement.</i>

46:18.000 --> 46:19.800
Ow!

46:18.800 --> 46:20.200
Ha!

46:50.300 --> 46:54.200
<i> So this fat-ass floor manager
lady comes up to me...</i>

46:54.200 --> 46:55.600
<i>and she looks like
a female Ted Koppel.</i>

46:56.000 --> 46:59.300
She says,
"Well, if you wanna piss your time away...

46:59.300 --> 47:01.100
why don't you move your desk
into the urinal?"

47:00.400 --> 47:03.700
Floor manager.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.200
I don't understand though.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
You been working at that job
for two years, but you hate it?

47:12.800 --> 47:13.400
What else am I gonna do?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.600
Well, there's always Kinko's.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.300
You must like something, Steve.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.400
In high school,
I wanted to be an actor...

47:23.600 --> 47:25.600
but, uh, that didn't turn out so hot.

47:26.100 --> 47:28.300
- So you went to Hollywood?
- No.

47:28.300 --> 47:31.900
He went to Broadway.
Right, Steve?

47:33.100 --> 47:36.600
Actually, I didn't
get around to that either.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.400
Summer stock.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
No.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.200
Everyone told me
I wasn't gonna make it anyway though.

47:46.300 --> 47:49.700
People tell us all the time
what we won't ever do.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.200
Won't ever read.
Won't ever have a job.

47:52.200 --> 47:54.600
Won't ever learn
to tie my own shoes.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.400
Won't ever have a girlfriend.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.300
I've done all of those things.

47:58.300 --> 48:00.200
But you can't tie your own shoes.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.800
- And you never had a girlfriend.
- That's right.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.300
But, guys, acting is hard.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.300
You have to remember lines.

48:08.300 --> 48:11.300
<i>Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

48:11.700 --> 48:14.500
Looks are important in that industry.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.700
<i>It's true.
Very true.</i>

48:16.700 --> 48:19.500
I'm sorry.
Somebody had to say it.

48:20.400 --> 48:26.900
I mean, you probably wouldn't have
made it, but you could have tried.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.300
<i>You wanna see
some really good acting?</i>

48:31.300 --> 48:34.900
<i>- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah. He does Chucky from Child's Play.</i>

48:34.900 --> 48:37.700
I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

48:37.700 --> 48:39.000
Aaah!

48:45.300 --> 48:46.900
This camping is fun!

48:46.900 --> 48:49.100
<i>Yeah.</i>

49:22.600 --> 49:23.700
- Is that Karen?
- Shh!

49:23.700 --> 49:27.000
Don't say her name!
What if she heard you?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.400
I don't want her to know I like her.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.700
Then she-

49:32.800 --> 49:34.800
Did you know Christ was a Jew?

49:38.100 --> 49:40.100
You should go talk to her.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.600
What do I say?

49:43.600 --> 49:47.800
I don't know. Uh, I pretty much stink
at that kind of stuff...

49:48.200 --> 49:50.900
but just go over there
and say something nice.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.500
<i>Oh, no.</i>

50:05.100 --> 50:06.400
Hot?

50:06.400 --> 50:09.100
What a cockblock.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.800
Hi. How are you today?

50:13.900 --> 50:15.800
<i>You love Lynn.</i>

50:15.900 --> 50:17.100
I do not.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.600
<i>Hey, guys. What's happening?
What are you laughing about?</i>

50:23.600 --> 50:25.100
- Hello, Lynn.
- Hey, Lynn.

50:25.300 --> 50:29.100
So, today's Friday,
uh, the day before Saturday.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.900
You got any big plans
for the weekend?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Big plans-
I'm goin' to Costco.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I got a few things to pick up.

50:36.300 --> 50:39.500
- I love Costco. Costco's good.
- I've been there.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.300
I love baseball better.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.000
Can I help?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.300
Eye contact.

50:47.900 --> 50:50.100
Oh.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.800
All right.
Yeah.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.200
Yeah. I could use a hand.
Come along. I'll pick you up at 10:00, okay?

50:56.400 --> 50:58.200
<i>All right. Cool.
See you then.</i>

50:58.200 --> 51:02.300
- See you guys later.
- Can I come with you, sexy?

51:03.300 --> 51:04.400
Smooth move, Ajax.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.100
I would definitely bring protection.

51:21.100 --> 51:23.800
All right!

51:36.600 --> 51:39.600
- Come on, Lynn!
- No, I have a terrible singing voice.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.500
Oh, come on!

51:54.000 --> 51:56.100
You're right.
You can't sing.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.700
But that's okay.
Jeffy still loves you.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.000
Ooh, this cart is too full.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.300
You're something else.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.300
- That's Costco.
- Barker?

52:13.200 --> 52:15.300
Hey!
How you doin', man?

52:15.300 --> 52:18.100
- I haven't seen you since high school.
- I don't know you.

52:18.100 --> 52:20.400
Wow! Looks like
you're doin' okay though.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.500
- I think you're confusing him with someone, sir.
- No, no. Dude, come on.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.800
- It's Peter. Peter Conway.
- Peter's another name for wiener.

52:26.900 --> 52:30.600
- Yes!
- No, sir, seriously. You're mixing him up.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.600
You said that same stuff
in high school, dude! That's fantastic!

52:33.600 --> 52:36.400
- I don't know you! I don't know you!
- No, no, no, Jeffy!

52:37.000 --> 52:38.800
Please, stop!
Will you just walk away, sir?

52:38.800 --> 52:42.000
- Oh, my God!
- Just walk away! Walk away!

52:42.000 --> 52:47.400
Dude, you've got to call me!
That is classic!

52:47.400 --> 52:49.400
Oh, man!

52:53.000 --> 52:55.300
You want another gallon of mustard?

52:55.300 --> 52:58.900
No, thanks. I'm still pretty full
from the jug of relish.

52:58.900 --> 53:02.400
Jeffy likes taking
long trips with Lynn.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
Yeah, me too, Jeffy.

53:06.800 --> 53:11.100
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my big brother, Jeremy.

53:11.800 --> 53:15.300
He was special.
Just like you.

53:19.700 --> 53:21.700
Is he competing this year?

53:23.400 --> 53:26.700
Well, he-
he died a few years ago.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.200
But I think you guys
would have been great friends.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.200
Father, I've been
doing something bad.

53:55.400 --> 53:55.800
Really bad.

53:59.700 --> 54:00.500
I'm a terrible person.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
<i>There are no terrible people.</i>

54:02.600 --> 54:05.000
There are only poor, misguided souls.

54:05.100 --> 54:07.800
Now, please, unburden yourself.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.200
You see, I was in a real bind, and-

54:15.900 --> 54:17.600
I'm sorry, Father.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.400
I can't even say the words.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.100
My son,
there is no sin unforgivable...

54:23.600 --> 54:25.900
to those that seek redemption.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.900
I've been pretending
to be mentally challenged...

54:36.900 --> 54:40.000
so I can fix the Special Olympics...

54:41.200 --> 54:43.900
to make money off of it.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.700
Father?

54:59.600 --> 55:01.800
Jesus, Father!
Whoa!

55:01.900 --> 55:04.600
<i>I'll see you rot in hell!</i>

55:04.700 --> 55:07.300
You piece of crap!

55:15.000 --> 55:16.100
<i>Okay, guys, elbows up.</i>

55:16.700 --> 55:18.100
Jimmy wouldn't say that.

55:18.700 --> 55:21.600
Jim, it's pretty standard-
"I'm going to Disney World!"

55:22.000 --> 55:23.900
- Uh-uh.
- Come on, Jimbo!

55:23.900 --> 55:27.400
All the great athletes say that after they win.
Michael Jordan said it.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.000
Michael Jordan can kiss my butt.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.700
Write me something new.
Jimmy have to work.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.400
<i>100-meter practice! Let's go, guys!</i>

55:43.400 --> 55:46.600
<i>Everybody in the 100 meters,
take a lane.</i>

55:47.900 --> 55:50.500
<i>- Full speed.
- Hey.</i>

55:50.400 --> 55:53.300
Hay is for horses.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.600
<i>How the hell can a guy like that
be beatin' ya? It ain't natural.</i>

56:17.600 --> 56:20.000
Will you cut it out with that stuff?
These guys are great!

56:20.100 --> 56:23.000
- Couple of 'em could be in the regular Olympics.
- Maybe on the French team.

56:23.100 --> 56:28.000
Yeah? There's a guy here from the Bahamas
who ran a marathon in two hours and 45 minutes.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.500
That's just propaganda.
One of ours can beat one of theirs.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.800
- It's simple physics. You just gotta push a little.
- I am pushing!

56:33.800 --> 56:35.700
Well, push a little harder!

56:35.800 --> 56:39.400
Do it for Stavi. Poor bastard's fingers
are thawing as we speak.

56:39.800 --> 56:43.900
<i>You know, maybe I should
just accept the fact that I can't win...</i>

56:43.900 --> 56:47.000
and stop lying to Lynn
and everybody else.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.200
<i>Hey, hey.
Don't go soft on me.</i>

56:50.100 --> 56:51.600
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

56:54.000 --> 56:56.200
This is about a piece of ass, isn't it?

56:57.500 --> 56:59.200
Don't call her that.

56:59.200 --> 57:00.100
Oh, that's good.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.000
You're doing Jeffy now.
Right?

57:03.000 --> 57:05.900
Because you'd have to be a moron
to think she'll fall for you.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.300
She thinks you're mentally retarded!

57:08.900 --> 57:11.800
<i>Christ. Steve-</i>

57:11.800 --> 57:16.800
Steve, if it's love that you want so bad,
if you win, I'll do ya.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.000
Let's just face it.
This isn't gonna work.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.200
That's it.
When the goin' gets tough, give up.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.400
That's what you're good at.

57:27.200 --> 57:30.100
You've got a chance to
change your whole life, Steve.

57:30.300 --> 57:32.400
Become a man.
Become a winner.

57:32.400 --> 57:35.700
Now, show some backbone.
Dig down deep and go kick that tard's ass.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.300
Don't ever say that word to me again!

57:39.400 --> 57:43.500
I mean it.
These guys are my friends.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.400
- It's on.
- Whoa! Whoa!

57:52.600 --> 57:54.900
Whoa!

58:19.000 --> 58:20.900
<i>Suck on that, Billy!</i>

58:21.000 --> 58:24.300
- Blaaah!
- Hey, Winston- Son of a-

58:35.400 --> 58:37.100
What happened here?

58:37.100 --> 58:39.600
- Pipe broke.
- It's faulty plumbing!

58:39.600 --> 58:41.700
- It's snowing.
- I had an accident.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.900
<i>A really big one!</i>

59:00.000 --> 59:03.500
That'd be Mr. Billy Joel in February, 1974...

59:03.500 --> 59:04.500
with the "Piano Man."

59:04.900 --> 59:07.200
<i>Okay, okay, what's this one?
What's this one?</i>

59:11.400 --> 59:14.500
<i>That's Mr. Stevie Wonder
in the summer of 1969...</i>

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
with "My Cherie Amour."

59:16.200 --> 59:20.800
- Stupendous.
- Steve, go ahead. Ask me any movie.

59:21.300 --> 59:23.200
<i>Um, Jaws.</i>

59:23.200 --> 59:25.400
That's a great movie.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.400
<i>Well, I guess it's bedtime.</i>

59:30.400 --> 59:31.300
<i>Let's do something.</i>

59:31.300 --> 59:34.200
Hey, Steve, take us somewhere.

59:34.200 --> 59:37.100
Yeah, right.
You guys know we can't go out at night.

59:37.100 --> 59:40.500
<i>Ooh! Ooh! I know!
Let's see a movie!</i>

59:40.500 --> 59:45.200
Guys, you know we can't leave. Right?
We can't go anywhere.

59:45.200 --> 59:47.300
Come on.
Give me a break, Steve.

59:48.100 --> 59:49.500
I don't even have a car.

59:49.500 --> 59:55.300
You could rent a car. Budget Rent-a-Car.
No drop-off fee whatsoever.

59:55.400 --> 59:59.100
Come on, Steve.
We're special. Help us a little.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.400
<i>You're gonna play that card?</i>

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.000
<i>Winston wants a hug.
Winston likes apples.</i>

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.500
<i>I believe that's my thing.</i>

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.200
If you let us go out,
I'll let you go out with my sister.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.600
We've been training you for nothing?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.900
Oh, come on, Billy.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.200
<i>I told you I was
telling the truth, Daddy.</i>

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.200
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.300
I'm not proud of myself.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.200
<i>There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.</i>

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.300
It's beautiful.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.200
There's dancing, and it's dirty.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.200
<i>- I love you.
- You're kiddin' me.</i>

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.400
You guys are actually
buyin' into this.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.700
Do you even have a soul?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.600
Oh, Mylanta.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.000
Lynn's boyfriend.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.800
Hello, Lynn's boyfriend!

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.600
- Shh!
- Wait till I tell the fellas!

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.400
- W-Wait! Wait! Shh!
- You have a girlfriend?

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.200
Guess what!
Guess what!

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.300
- I just saw Lynn's boyfriend!
- Where?

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.000
And he was kissing with a girl.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.700
- Ohh!
- Oh, no.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.300
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah. Let's go say hello.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.400
How come you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.800
Hi, Lynn's boyfriend
and... not L-Lynn.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.400
- She's my cousin.
- No, I'm not his cousin.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.200
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Lynn's boyfriend's cousin.
- Is Lynn here?

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.400
No, she's not here.
But she might come.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.700
- Hi, David!
- Hi, David. What did you think of the flick?

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.900
- What are you guys doing here?
- J-Jeffy's birthday.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.200
<i>Never seen Dirty Dancing.
Hello, waitress.</i>

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.100
- Hi.
- No, that's Lynn's boyfriend's cousin.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.100
No, no. I'm not his cousin.
I'm not your cousin.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.000
- No, not cousin. She's just a buddy.
- "Buddy"?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.800
<i>He was licking his buddy's ears.</i>

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:03.100
<i>I wasn't licking her ears.
I was just looking for an earring.</i>

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.400
- And she found it.
- Good-bye.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.600
Good-bye, hooker lady.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.700
Seriously, it's probably...

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.500
not a good idea
to tell anybody about this.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500
<i>'Cause it'd be a very,
very, very bad thing...</i>

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.700
<i>if they knew you went off campus
this late at night.</i>

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.500
I mean, they might not
let you compete in the games.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.100
Oh, God.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.000
It's okay.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.200
Don't worry.
We won't tell anybody.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.100
Well, there you go.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.800
I always knew
you were smart, Jeffy.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.000
<i>Could you take us home, David?</i>

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.800
Oh, well, I- I- I'd like to, but I-

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.700
Or we could call Lynn
so that we don't get caught.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.400
Oh, what the heck.
I'll swing you guys by on the way home.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.000
- Shotgun!
- I'm parked out front.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.500
Almost there.
Okay, guys.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.300
Oh, you guys!
Where have-

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.300
David! What the hell?
I have been worried sick!

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:11.000
Relax, honey.
I just took 'em to the mall to hang out.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.100
The mall closes at 9:00.
It's 12:00.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.500
We stopped off for ice cream.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.600
When the fuck
did we get ice cream?

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.500
Jeffy, I won't be mad.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.100
Just tell me the truth.
Where were you guys?

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.200
<i>Did you get ice cream?</i>

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.100
David told Jeffy not to talk...

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.400
about his pants around his ankles...

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.800
and the girl looking for her earring.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.700
How could you?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.200
They're making up stories.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.100
It's late for them.
They're delirious.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.000
<i>Was I sleeping?</i>

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.100
Kara, Shane,
will you get these guys to their rooms.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.100
<i>Come on, Lynn!</i>

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.600
<i>Can I get that ice cream now?</i>

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.900
Hi, everybody, this is Steve Levy...

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.600
coming to you from Bobcat Stadium
in beautiful San Marcos, Texas.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:04.400
<i>This'll serve as the home for the
track and field events for Special Olympics.</i>

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400
The games are coming up next, live!

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.000
<i>I'd like to place $5,000 on Jeffy.</i>

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.300
On Jeffy, huh?

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.700
You got it.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.500
<i>Let me win. But if I cannot win,
let me be brave in the attempt.</i>

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.800
<i>First up in the pentathlon, the long jump.</i>

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.700
<i> You gotta love the grit
and determination of these very special athletes.</i>

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.000
Oh, oh, oh!

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.200
<i>Up next, Glen Chervin.</i>

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.500
<i>This young man has competed in
the last five Special Olympics...</i>

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.600
<i>Always finishing near the top.</i>

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.800
<i>5.5 meters!
Wow, that's one heck of a jump!</i>

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200
<i>Jeffy!</i>

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.700
<i>And newcomer Jeffy Dahmor, with an "O."</i>

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.100
<i>This is Jeffy's first Special Olympics.</i>

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.700
<i>Whoa! 6. 1 meters!</i>

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.300
<i>That's gonna be hard to beat!</i>

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.700
<i>Here comes Jimmy Washington,
always the crowd favorite.</i>

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.600
<i>You know, when it comes to
Special Olympics records...</i>

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.300
<i>Jimmy practically wrote the book.</i>

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
<i> 6.5 meters!
And Jimmy Washington wins the long jump!</i>

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.600
Hey! Jimmy!

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.900
<i>Next up, it's the shot put.</i>

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.200
<i>- Thomas Opedio.</i>

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.500
<i>You know this guy might not be
the most talented athlete here...</i>

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.600
<i>but he's certainly got
one of the biggest hearts.</i>

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.500
<i>- Glen Chervin...</i>

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
<i>with quite a nice toss!</i>

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.000
<i>Jimmy Washington tosses it
just a bit further!</i>

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.800
It's Jeffy Dahmor's turn.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.800
<i>- And yes!
- Come on!</i>

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.700
<i>We have today's first upset!</i>

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:32.500
<i>The newcomer, Jeffy Dahmor,
wins the shot put!</i>

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
<i>And the officials have raised
the bar now to 1.6 meters.</i>

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.300
<i>This is quite high
for most of the athletes.</i>

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.900
<i>Glen Chervin tries.</i>

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.200
<i>- Oh!</i>

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.500
<i>Even the great Jimmy Washington
is having trouble.</i>

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.400
Do it, Jeffy!
Do it, Jeffy!

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.700
<i>It's all up to Jeffy Dahmor now.</i>

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:01.500
<i>And he does it! Jeffy Dahmor wins
his second consecutive event!</i>

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.900
Runners, take your mark.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.400
<i>And now, the final event of the day...</i>

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.400
<i>the 100-meter hurdles.</i>

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.100
Set!

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.500
Come on, Jeffy!
Leap! Leap!

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.300
Jump higher!
Jump higher!

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.600
<i>Come on!
Aw, come on!</i>

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.300
<i> The true champion
is showing his colors today...</i>

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.900
as Jimmy Washington easily
takes the 100-meter hurdles.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.500
As Jimmy Washington easily
takes the 100-meter hurdles.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.800
<i>Wow, this is truly amazing, folks.</i>

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.900
<i>After four of the five events,
Jimmy Washington is only five points ahead...</i>

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.200
of a remarkable newcomer,
Jeffy Dahmor.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:03.500
Folks, it has come down
to tomorrow's final event-

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.800
the 400-meter run,
the Cadillac of Special Olympics competition.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.400
It's worth approximately 250 points...

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.300
depending upon their times.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.200
This will decide whether
Jimmy Washington or Jeffy Dahmor...

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.800
<i>takes home the gold.</i>

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.000
How come guys like us never get the girl?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.500
Don't lump me in with you.
I get the girl sometimes.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.800
Calm down.
I was just trying to cheer you up.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.300
How?
By calling us both losers?

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:02.000
Can I have your autograph, Jimmy?
Please?

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.200
Yeah.
Jesus.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.899
- Hi, Lynn.
- Oh, hey, Jeffy.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.100
Where's your date?

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.300
Jeffy's kinda stag tonight.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.100
Oh. That's okay.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I haven't eaten in, like, 10 minutes.
You wanna find some food?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:20.399
Ten minutes!

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.500
You'll have to excuse me.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.399
I kinda pig out
when I get depressed.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.000
Why Lynn depressed?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.500
Oh, I'm upset 'cause of... David.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.899
- Tell Jeffy joke.
- What?

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:45.800
The joke with the boy at sea.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.000
- The one you were gonna tell at lunch.
- Oh.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.000
You don't wanna hear me butcher it.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.700
Oh, come on.
I bet you knock it out of the park.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.200
Okay. Okay.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.200
So, there's this old woman.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.000
She was, like, you know, a grandmother.
She was, like, 80 or something.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.400
And she brings
her grandson to the beach.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.800
And he's little.
He's, like, you know, three, or-

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.400
or, like, three-and-a-half,
or four-ish, you know-

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.700
The boy's young.
Jeffy get it.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400
Okay. Well, the grandmother-

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.300
Jeffy!
The Kids of Widney High is on!

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.100
- Come on!
- Okay! Okay!

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.200
I've never seen Billy this excited before.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.600
Billy a big fan
of Kids of Widney High...

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.400
so Jeffy called number on back of CD
and asked them to come.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.000
That was really nice of you.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.100
You never stop surprising me.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.100
You're a really good person, Jeffy.
You know that?

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:01.200
- Thank you.
- You wanna dance?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.700
No, no.
Jeffy not a good dancer.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.600
- Come on!
- No. No!

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.600
Would you teach Jeffy
how to slow-dance?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.300
Yeah. Sure. Come on.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.700
Okay, you're gonna
put your arms around me.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.600
No, no. Not on my stomach.
Just sort of around my waist.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.300
And I'll put my arms around you,
and we'll just move.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.600
Okay.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:26.800
What's wrong?

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:34.200
Special Olympics are almost over, and...

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200
Jeffy's gonna miss Lynn.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.200
Oh, no.
Hey, we'll still hang out.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.100
We'll still be friends.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.500
Jeffy would like that.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.100
Lynn's perfect.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.600
Makes Jeffy wanna
wake up in the morning.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.900
Lynn needs someone to appreciate her...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
like she's the only girl on the planet.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.600
That's-

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.400
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.500
I think you're pretty perfect too, Jeffy.

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.200
You're kind and funny.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.700
And really brave.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.100
Oh, Jeffy, no, no-
I'm- I'm sorry. I didn't-

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.400
- It's Jeffy's fault.
- No, it's not your fault. It's not.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.900
You did nothing wrong.
I- Um-

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.700
God. I'm sorry.
I-Jeffy, I have to- I-

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.000
Billy, you up?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.200
No.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.800
Let me ask you something.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:19.400
Do you think there are
good people and bad people...

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.000
or do you think life gets so hard...

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.600
sometimes good people
have to do bad things?

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.100
Nah. Just good people
and bad people.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.100
There's no gray areas.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.700
Good luck.

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.600
<i>It's entirely my fault.</i>

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.600
<i>- There's no way it was your fault.
- Matt, you weren't there.</i>

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.200
I'm a volunteer.
He's an athlete.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.400
It's not allowed.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.000
And I let him think it was a real date.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.100
I don't deserve to be here.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.800
<i>I- I can't do this anymore.</i>

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.800
<i>I'm done. It's over for me.</i>

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:15.900
Steve Levy here with arguably the greatest
Special Olympian of all time, Jimmy Washington.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:19.400
Jimmy, folks at home wanna know: What
are you feeling heading into today's final event?

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.900
I feel great, like always.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.400
Jimmy's gonna win.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.000
You've won six
consecutive gold medals.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.900
This Jeffy Dahmor
could get in the way of number seven.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.800
Jeffy Dahmor.
Who's Jeffy Dahmor?

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.800
Look at me.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.800
I'm young, handsome, top shape.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.600
Bring on Jeffy Dahmor.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.200
Jimmy's gon' bring home the gold.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.600
Clearly, lack of confidence
will not be an issue.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:46.500
Steve Levy reporting from Bobcat Stadium,
home of Special Olympics.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.000
<i>So here we go. This is it.</i>

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.700
<i>Will Jimmy Washington win
his seventh consecutive gold medal...</i>

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.000
or is there a new champion
on the horizon?

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.000
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're not
enjoying this action, check your pulse.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.100
Jimmy, you're goin' down.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.800
<i>Good-bye, Wheaties.
Good-bye, Hollywood Squares.</i>

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.700
Good-bye, bling-bling.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.000
<i>On your mark!</i>

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.500
<i>Set!</i>

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.100
Come on!
Hustle! Hustle! Come on!

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:03.900
Now's your moment! Now's your chance!
Go for it! Go! Go! Go!

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.300
Come on! Hustle!
Come on!

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.100
That's it! That's it!

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.700
- Ohh!
- Thank you, God! Thank you!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.500
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.700
Don't go back!
Go this way!

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.100
That a boy, Jeffy!

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.600
Come on, Jimmy, get up.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.500
- That's it. Get him up.
- What are you doing, you stupid son of a bitch?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
You're a loser!
You'll always be a loser!

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.700
<i>So, Glen Chervin
wins the 400-meter race.</i>

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.500
<i>And here we go.
Thank you.</i>

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.800
Ladies and gentlemen, wow!

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.000
In a stunning upset, the gold medal
goes to a remarkable young underdog.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.700
It's Glen Chervin!

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.100
Jimmy, you suck!

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.200
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Jimmy didn't win?

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.300
Jimmy didn't win!

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.800
Isn't it wonderful?
Jimmy didn't win! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You did great.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.900
I came in fourth.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.300
That's okay, Thomas.
I came in last in my race.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:49.700
You complete me.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.200
I do?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.600
<i>Glen! You won!</i>

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.500
What? I did?

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.600
What are you sorry about?

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.500
Well, now Stavi
can't get his fingers back.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.200
No, he can.
All Jimmy had to do was lose.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.500
And he did... because of you!

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.700
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't have stayed behind you so long.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.200
Excuse me.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.600
Whoo!

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.900
Jeffy!
You were so great.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.300
I'm- I'm so proud of you.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.600
Thanks.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.800
Congratulations, Jeffy.
Great race.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.000
Would you come with me, please?

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.100
That was terrific sportsmanship, Jeffy.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.500
<i>And now,
the bronze medal goes to Jeffy Dahmor!</i>

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.000
<i>That's my son, Jeffy!</i>

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.100
My son, Jeffy!

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.700
Congratulations, Jeffy.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.800
The winner of the silver medal,
Jimmy Washington!

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.400
Congratulations, Jimmy.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.200
<i>And the gold medal
goes to Glen Chervin!</i>

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.200
<i>- Congratulations, Glen.
- You're welcome!</i>

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.800
Let's have a big round of applause
for our terrific pentathlon athletes!

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:36.100
<i>Thank you for coming out,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.800
- This has been the best Special-
- Excuse me.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.100
- Can I see that?
- Oh, sure.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.700
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I have something to say.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.500
I can't accept this.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.100
<i>I can't accept this because...</i>

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.000
I'm a fraud.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.600
Oy.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.500
I'm not...

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.800
mentally challenged.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.000
<i>- I don't even deserve to be on
the same field as these people.
- That's right!</i>

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.900
- Yeah!
- Shit, man!

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.900
<i>Shame on you!</i>

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.700
So I'm gonna give this award
to the person-

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.400
The champion who deserves it.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.300
<i>- Thomas.
- Thomas!</i>

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.300
<i>Come here, man.</i>

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.000
Stand up here.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.100
<i>All right!</i>

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.300
You were right behind me, buddy.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.400
This belongs to you.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.400
I'm so-

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.100
This is such a great honor.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:27.700
I'm very excited
from the bottom of my heart.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.000
And I would like to dedicate this...

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.800
to a very, very special girl
named-

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.500
Lynn, I am so-

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.300
<i>Oh, geez!</i>

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.200
Oh, and today...

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.700
<i>I would- I would like...</i>

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.800
to meditate on some facts.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.600
Did you know that Mentos
is America's number-one candy?

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.500
<i>And also-</i>

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.500
<i>And, um-And, Karen...</i>

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.700
<i>I w- I would- I would like to-</i>

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.800
But soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.600
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Yada-yada-yada.

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.100
<i>Come on, Billy.
You're phoning it in.</i>

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.900
Look, I told you-Jackie Gleason
didn't rehearse, and neither do I.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.300
You scratched my CD, you know.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.700
You picked it up in clear daylight
and you scratched it.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.500
Yeah, I know. But I thought
we put that behind us.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.300
Now, come on, Billy.
Let's do it. From the top.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.200
Keep your pants on, Spielberg.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.400
Thanks for springin' for lunch.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.500
Next time we'll go Danish
and split it 60-60.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.300
Don't you mean 50-50?

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.400
What, you don't tip?

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.100
I'm so glad you called. I missed you.
It's great to catch up.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.800
Yeah. Good times.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.100
Listen, you wanna come in
and meet some of the fellas I work with?

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.000
- They're a hoot.
- Sure.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.600
Come on, Billy.
From the top.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.200
Okay.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.400
But soft! What light-

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.500
Could you fix the lighting, please?

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.400
What?

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.000
<i>Steve, please. Be a love.</i>

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.700
<i>Thomas, where's my water?
My throat is parched.</i>

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.200
What kind do you want,
Evian or tap water?

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.400
Surprise me.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.800
Freakin' stars.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.600
Hey, guys!
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.400
<i>- Hi, Lynn!
- Hi, Lynn!</i>

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.600
- Hi, Lynn!
- Whoa!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.900
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.300
<i>- Oh!
- You okay, Mr. Stevie?</i>

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.300
How many fingers do you see?

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.100
Do you need a medic?

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.800
He probably needs
mouth-to-mouth, Lynn.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.000
I'll do it!

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.100
I'm good!
I'm fine!

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.400
- Come on, baby.
- Mr. Clumsy.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.700
<i>- Are you sure you're okay?
- I- I'm fine.</i>

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.000
Broke the fall with my forehead.

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.400
<i>Steve gave us all jobs.</i>

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.700
Isn't that wonderfully nice, Lynn?

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.200
One could almost say Christ-like.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.100
Yeah.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.700
I'm starting to feel like
you guys are playing me.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.700
<i>- Lynn, I promise I had nothing to do with it.
- It's true, Lynn.</i>

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.600
He's totally ignorant.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:46.000
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Winston.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.500
Guys, can we be alone
for a few moments?

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.700
<i>- Yeah absolutely. No problem.
- Sure.</i>

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.300
Eye contact.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.200
Come on.

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.800
Lynn, you have no idea
how sorry I am.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.200
It's okay.
I forgive you.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.900
- You do?
- I didn't, at first, but I forgive you.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.400
<i>Oh, you saw the thing
on 20/20, and you-</i>

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.200
<i>- No.
- Me.</i>

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.000
- I tell.
- Stavi?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I told her everything-

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.600
how you got me the job, how you scammed
the system so I could get my fingers back.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:43.100
And how you secretly
want to marry her.

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.700
<i>I don't remember saying that.</i>

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.200
Starting fresh?

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.100
Yeah. I'd like that.

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.200
It's a start.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.500
<i>Come on!
Give him a kiss!</i>

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.200
<i>Get a room!
I gotta do a play here tonight!</i>

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.200
<i>Tickets. Tickets. Who needs tickets?
You're not a cop, are you?</i>

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.400
You got tickets. Okay. Tickets. Cheaper
than the box office. You save some money.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But soft!

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.300
What light through
yonder window breaks?

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:46.600
It is the east...

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.800
and Juliet is the sun.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.300
Oh, rise, fair sun...

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.700
and kill the envious moon...

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.000
who is already sick
and pale with grief.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
<i>When he bestrides...</i>

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.700
<i>the lazy-pacing clouds...</i>

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:08.400
and sails upon the bosom of the air!

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.600
On second thought, life is short!

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.600
I love ya!
Hit the music, fellas!
