WEBVTT

00:39.706 --> 00:41.624
Are you drinking tea, Hank?

00:41.708 --> 00:44.294
No. And so what if I am?

00:44.961 --> 00:48.381
You don't look so good.
Maybe you got the flu bug, honey.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.800
I'm just tired. I'm not sick.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.886
Whatever you say, sicky.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.900
-You gotta go there.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.569
The margaritas come in a glass
shaped like a gecko.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.821
-That sounds <i>muy caliente.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:13.406
Hey, you got the funny pages?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.161
That you, ol' top? Hey.

01:18.244 --> 01:22.540
How about tossing me another roll of TP?
I'm working on quite a... project in here.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.506


01:29.589 --> 01:31.382
-Told you so, honey.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.510


01:34.803 --> 01:35.887
Peggy?

01:35.970 --> 01:38.181
-Shut the door, Dad. It's freezing.

01:38.681 --> 01:39.849


01:39.933 --> 01:42.227
Ugh. You guys are sick, too?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.105
Ugh. Clark Peters sneezed on me.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.606
Stupid kid.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.192
Can't even cover his mouth
when he sneezes.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.694
He should be expelled.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.200
Hank, our prescription should be ready.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.035
One of us needs to pick it up.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.995
Okay.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.542
I've got a fever.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.044
Plus, I cooked us dinner last night.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.922
You just dumped a bunch of crackers
on a plate.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.883
Besides, I've got a fever and the chills.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.471
Bobby, you always wanted
to drive to the store, right?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.473
All right, fine.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.683
I'll do it.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.310
You guys had crackers for dinner?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.521
Why didn't you wake me up?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.732
-

02:31.693 --> 02:32.569
Ugh.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.531
Oh.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.496
Looks like the aliens finally got Hank.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.875
At least they had the decency
to put his pajamas back on.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.126
Not like with me.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.504
Whatcha guys lookin'... Oh, my God. Hank.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.840
You're burning up.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.843
He's lying here sick,
and you didn't help him?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.804
So insensitive.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.142
Actually, we thought he was dead.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.227
There you go, Hank.

03:06.311 --> 03:10.023
Now, don't you worry.
Bill is gonna take care of everything.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.441
Bill?

03:11.524 --> 03:12.525
Yes, Hank?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.777
I have to throw up.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.779
That's okay. I'll get a bucket.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.782
-But not my good bucket.
-Of course not.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.036
Everybody comfy?

03:23.119 --> 03:25.705
Now here's your remote and the TV Guide.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.457
You'll see I've highlighted a few things.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.626
There's a movie
with James Garner and a Doberman

03:29.709 --> 03:30.960
I think you'd both enjoy.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.129
Oh, you are so thoughtful, Bill.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.297
I'm gonna start dinner.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.299
You two holler if you need anything.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.220
If I make it through this,
I promise to be a better kid.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.096
I'll do my homework,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.891
take out the garbage, you name it.

03:44.974 --> 03:49.062
If I make it through this,
I promise to learn how to ride a bike.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.232
You don't know how to ride a bike?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.151
I grew up in Montana, Bobby,
we rode horses.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.153
Though a bike
probably would have been better

03:57.237 --> 03:59.322
because I wouldn't have had
to castrate it.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.036
Mm-hmm.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.288
Very nice.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.665
Congratulations.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.542
You're all a perfect 98.6.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.545
I noticed we're out of juice.
I'll pick some up in the morning.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.755
Well, thanks, Bill,

04:15.838 --> 04:19.092
but we're all feeling so good,
maybe we should just take it from here.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.927
Oh. We appreciate all you've done,

04:21.010 --> 04:23.513
but you do have your own life
to get back to.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.223
No, I don't. I can stay.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.100
Uh, really, it's no trouble.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.770
Well, thanks anyway, soldier,
but you are relieved of duty.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.274
I'll just dish up your lunch before I go.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.442
I made my Nana's chicken soup...

04:37.026 --> 04:38.861
...with the squiggly noodles.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.254
Hmm.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.299
Bill?

05:01.968 --> 05:05.763
Uh, Bill, you were gonna poison us,
weren't you?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.640
Yes,

05:07.724 --> 05:08.850
but just a little bit.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.892
Don't be mad.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.811
I'm not mad, Bill.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.063
The truth is, until you tried to...

05:14.147 --> 05:17.066
"induce vomiting," you were
great at taking care of us.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.068
You got a real knack for this.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.403
Do you really think so?

05:20.486 --> 05:24.282
Sure. I bet there are other people
who could use a guy like you.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.492
Maybe you oughta think about volunteering.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.952
That's a great idea.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.829
The world's filled with sick people.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.664
I'm gonna look into this
right after lunch.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.084
Uh, Bill, we're gonna throw away the soup.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.294
I understand.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.506
Oh, look at all
these great volunteer opportunities.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.259
They're letting men be candy stripers now.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.303
-Huh.
-At this place,

05:45.386 --> 05:47.930
you can teach hip-hop dance
to troubled teens.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.933
I'd be happy to show you
some of my sweet moves.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.853
Yeah, yeah, hee-yah.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.815
"Wanted: Patient, caring people

05:57.899 --> 06:02.445
to assist in light chores and conversation
at sober living facility."

06:02.528 --> 06:04.489
Huh. A halfway house.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.324
That sounds perfect for you, Bill.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.451
I bet you could help
a lot of folks over there.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.703
Yeah, you're great at conversation.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.374
If Nancy didn't make me get off the phone,
I could talk to you all night.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.209
I'm going down first thing tomorrow.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.628
Can't wait.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.302
Well, Bill, that's what Opportunity House
is all about. Any questions?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.720
Can I start now, right now?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.472
I like your spirit.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.640
You remind me of myself

06:30.723 --> 06:32.809
during my first relief trip
to South America.

06:33.267 --> 06:37.313
Yup. I used this to serve beans
to the people of Belize.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.899
I keep it as a symbol of my promise
to serve my fellow man.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.443
Oh, that's a great spoon.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.986
I'm glad you stopped by, Bill.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.280
Opportunity House is always looking
for good people,

06:46.364 --> 06:48.408
especially now
that we're expanding the facility.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.742
So where do you need me?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.161
I'll do anything.
No job is too humiliating.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.287
Well, that depends.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.914
There are two kinds of volunteers.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.167
People who care,
and people who really, really care.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.335
Which one are you?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.753
I really, really care.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.672
You have a passion for helping people.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.882
That's very Bono. I like that.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.095
Well, I saw Bill leave
for the halfway house this morning.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.431
He was wearing his blue shirt.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.099
I love that shirt.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.185
You know, I think Bill's finally found
his thing.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.148
Hey, guys. Great news.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.608
I got my very own alcoholics.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.860
-What?
-Yeah.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.736
Opportunity House is too crowded,

07:25.820 --> 07:28.531
so I'm taking some of the guys
until they can expand.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.700
I even got a sign.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.788
So Bill's house is now "Bill's House"?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.050
All right. This way.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.719
A halfway house?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.053
This is all I need.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.681
A bunch of jittery drunks
breaking into my house

07:53.764 --> 07:55.308
and rummaging through my guns.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.686
Yeah, man. I don't want them takin'
no dang ol' 12 steps on my lawn, man.

07:58.769 --> 07:59.645
Now, hold on.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.022
We all thought it was great

08:01.105 --> 08:03.816
that Bill was working
at a halfway house before.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.735
So it has to move temporarily.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.111
It's gotta go somewhere, right?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.446
Hey, hillbillies.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.947
What's going on over there?

08:10.031 --> 08:12.617
Some alcoholics followed Bill home
from work.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.951
He's keeping 'em.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.245
Boozehounds in neighborhood? Bah.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.624
I'm going home and deadbolting doors,
so drunks don't steal my mouthwash.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.001
Kahn, these guys aren't criminals.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.420
They're good people
trying to get back on their feet.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.255
and they're not gonna be here long,

08:26.339 --> 08:28.716
so just cut them, and Bill, some slack.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.801
Yeah, that's not really my thing.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.930
I've never had so many people for dinner.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.557
I had to put the leaf in my table.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.976
Thanks for saying I should do this, Hank.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.895
Yeah, thanks, Hank.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.855
Heck, you're the one doing the good deeds.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.732
Here's to you, Bill.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.569
Oh, that's sweet,

08:48.653 --> 08:50.613
but I'm gonna have to ask you
not to drink in the alley.

08:52.323 --> 08:56.244
I'm sorry, my mouth was full of beer,
so I may not have heard you correctly.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.081
Mm-hmm. We at Bill's House are focused
on a temptation-free recovery.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.708
Well, if it's only for a couple of days.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.383
It's weird.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.926
I know it's not there,

09:12.009 --> 09:14.470
but I can feel the can in my hand.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.432
I tell you,

09:18.516 --> 09:19.892
I'd become an alcoholic

09:19.976 --> 09:23.437
if I could just eat Bill's lasagna
one more time.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.147
You're clearing the table?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.607
Okay, mister, what'd you do?

09:26.691 --> 09:30.027
Nothing. I'm just cleaning up
like a good kid would.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.862
Like I promised...

09:31.946 --> 09:34.448
and if I remember correctly...

09:34.532 --> 09:35.908
Wha... Oh, that.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.120
That was the fever talking.
We were out of our minds.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.789
You made a promise to Jesus.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.749
Damn it.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.170
Now. that's what I call
some refreshing iced tea.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.213
I like it.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.382
I really, really like it.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.386
Yes, I am one satisfied tea drinker.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.059
Beer?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.102
Dang it, Dale.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.146
Bill said no alcohol in the alley.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.648
Now, this means a lot to him.
We need to help him out.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.484
Come on.
Bill can't take care of those guys.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.404
How many times a week
does he have popcorn for dinner?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.656
He doesn't even pop it, Hank.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.824
Hey, brothers.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.243
He's coming right at us.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.494
Shut up, Dale.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.122
He's just being a good neighbor
and saying hello.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.457
-Hey, there.
-Hey, man.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.083
Name's Mikey. Got 48 days.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.294
Feeling good, gonna make it.
Happy as hell to meet you.

10:28.377 --> 10:31.005
Sun's shining, great day to be alive,
but for the grace of God, am I right?

10:31.088 --> 10:33.257
I'm optimistic, focused,
got my eye on the prize,

10:33.341 --> 10:35.134
know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tuned in, feeling good,

10:35.217 --> 10:36.427
happy as hell to meet you.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.679
Hey, brother.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.766
Well, he seems, uh... nice.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.569
Bill?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.614
Let it all out. Oh, hey there, Hank.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.867
Oh, sorry. I, uh, I heard male crying.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.078
Yeah. It's okay, we're just
in the middle of group.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.579
Randy here had a breakthrough.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.083
I see.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.585
Wait, you're in charge of therapy?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.129
Oh, sure. It's one of my many hats.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.757
I do the cooking, cleaning, rec time.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.133
Uh, that sounds like a lot.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.302
It is overwhelming sometimes.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.637
But in a fulfilling way.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.889
Oh, no, I forgot.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.433
Hank, I have to run to the pharmacy,
pick up their meds.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.601
Could you cover group?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.727
-Uh...
-I won't be long.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.063
We're working on taking emotional risks.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.276
Uh... hello.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.528
Hello, friend.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.863
I'm Stuart, and I'm an alcoholic.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.532
Okay.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.534
They called me Appleseed for 15 years,

11:41.617 --> 11:45.079
but that life of toad licking
and cherry wine is behind me.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.747
Now I've got a sober name

11:46.831 --> 11:48.207
for a sober future.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.375
I got something to say.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.419
Uh, are you sure?

11:51.502 --> 11:53.754
I feel nervous and excited and thirsty.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.549
I lost my favorite T-shirt,
and my big toe itches,

11:56.632 --> 11:57.675
and I hate my dad.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.720
All right then.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.347
Lesson one: Getting to know your bike.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.391
Let's start with handlebars.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.393
Oh, just give me the freakin' thing.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.937
But you haven't even heard
the part about balance.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.023
Bobby, I'm sure riding a bike
is just like swimming.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.192
You hold your breath and kick like crazy.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.407
Mom, are you okay?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.369
You don't know how to swim, do you?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.954
Not so much.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.254
We're out of milk?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.881
I just bought this milk.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.841
I'm done taking out the trash.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.634
Hank, they've eaten everything.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.471
Oh, there's more to do than I thought.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.389
Can you watch the guys
while I'm at the store?

12:45.473 --> 12:46.849
They're making clay ashtrays.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.477
Well, what happened to the ones
they made out of seashells?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.729
Mm-mm.

12:53.147 --> 12:57.026
All I'm saying, friend,
is that you're bogarting all the clay.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.153
Well, I smoke more,
and I got five days on you.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.363
Whoa, let's not start judging.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.406
You judged me first.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.784
Hey, nobody's judging anybody.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.662
Now it sounds like Stuart is feeling,
uh...

13:08.913 --> 13:10.664
Just give him some clay.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.795
Hank, look who I found in the driveway.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.797
It's my boss, Mr. Draper.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.965
You've got a heck
of a bighearted friend here, Hank.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.634
-Thanks.
-What a guy.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.594
I wish I had a hundred Bill Dauterives.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.180
Yeah, the thing is, you only have one.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.349
And he's working himself like crazy.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.975
Both of us are, actually.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.561
We've even had to dip
into our vacation days.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.647
Addictions don't take a vacation, Hank.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.233
Good thing there are people like us
who really, really care.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.193
Yeah, we're still pretty tired.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.530
Anyway, how's that addition
to Opportunity House coming along?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.865
Spectacular. We open in a couple of weeks.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.742
Hey, maybe you can cut the ribbon.

13:47.368 --> 13:51.163
It's... No, really, I'm gonna cut it.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.167
<i>♪ It's the eye of the tiger ♪</i>

13:55.251 --> 13:56.752
<i>♪ It's the thrill of the fight ♪</i>

13:56.836 --> 14:00.381
<i>♪ Rising up to the challenge
of our rival ♪</i>

14:00.464 --> 14:03.133
So I see your new best friends
the alcoholics

14:03.217 --> 14:04.718
got a basketball hoop.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.136
Give it a rest, Dale.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.805
I don't have the energy right now.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.890
Hey, brother, toss me the ball.
Man, I love hoops.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.017
Went to a Spurs game
before I got with the program,

14:12.101 --> 14:13.310
long story short, lost my job.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.524
I do so have H-O-R.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.570
Gary, we agreed
the court is a no-conflict zone.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.657
Okay, Mom, now, let's discuss potholes.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.951
Bobby, I can do this on my own.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.369
That being said,

14:30.452 --> 14:33.372
if you let go of this bike,
you will never see TV again.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.667
You're doing great, Mom.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.586
Hey, don't let go, don't let go,
don't let go.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.464
He let go!

14:44.592 --> 14:45.968
What? You did.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.221
Boy, just think.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.515
In a couple days, these guys will be gone,

14:51.599 --> 14:54.810
and neither of us will ever have
to sit in a circle again.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.521
I've kind of grown attached
to them, though.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.773
This doesn't mean
you have to stop volunteering.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.067
I'm sure they're gonna need you
at Opportunity House

15:02.151 --> 15:03.527
after the big expansion.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.112
You're probably right.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.197
Oh. His first night here,

15:07.281 --> 15:09.658
Randy thought this sock
was trying to kill him.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.671
What in the...

15:23.422 --> 15:24.715
What's going on here?

15:24.798 --> 15:26.717
Just dropping off some people
at Bill's House.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.928
-Dropping off?
-Hank!

15:29.011 --> 15:30.930
There's so many of them.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.932
There's already a line for the bathroom.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.685
Wait, no. No, no, no.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.520
You're supposed to be taking people away.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.315
No place to take 'em.
Opportunity House is closed.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.151
-What?
-It'll be fun, right, Hank?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.320
Yeah, just like a giant sleepover.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.697
Only we'll never get to sleep.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.333
-That's stinkin' thinkin', Elroy.
-Anyone here counting days?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.460
Well, they took my car and my crossbow.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.045
This is crazy.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.714
You can't have this many people
living in your house.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.800
And I can't keep taking time off work.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.385
I said I'd help them, Hank.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.345
It may kill me, but I'm gonna do it.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.224
I just have to really, really,
really, really care.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.183
Oh, God.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.603
Look, we need to talk to Draper
and tell him you can't do this.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.563
-Excuse me, where should I sleep?
-When's dinner?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.773
I need a meeting.

16:22.856 --> 16:23.774
We're losing them!

16:23.857 --> 16:27.486
Call Pizza Joe's and tell them
Bill needs eight of his usuals.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.947
God grant me the serenity...

16:30.030 --> 16:33.075
To accept the things I cannot change,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.202
courage to the change the things I can...

16:45.254 --> 16:46.630
Hey, Mr. Draper.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.298
Nice place you got here.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.801
I didn't know
they had gated communities in Arlen.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.303
As you can imagine,
I was worried about diversity,

16:53.387 --> 16:55.681
but Dr. Rawalapindi is from Bangladesh,

16:55.764 --> 16:58.017
and the Kims are from Korea via London.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.019
It's a regular U.N. in here.

17:01.020 --> 17:05.399
So anyway, uh, we need to talk
about Opportunity House.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.152
Sure, Hank. Come on in.
Just brewed some coffee.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.697
Mr. Phillip,

17:11.780 --> 17:14.241
they got the hummus stain
out of your tuxedo.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.035
Wonderful, Dominga.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.996
Mm, this coffee is Fair Trade.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.750
With every sip, you can practically taste
the Guatemalan family being uplifted.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.627
Dominga's face lights up
every time I ask for a cup.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.672
And I am almost done reading
Fast Food Nation.

17:30.007 --> 17:30.924
Okay.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.886
So what happened over
at Opportunity House?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.472
Funding fell through. Damn bean counters.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.099
I wish they could look in the eyes
of the people they're hurting.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.769
Listen, this is too much
for Bill and me to handle.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.313
These people can't stay
at his house anymore.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.815
Okay. No problem.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.151
Why don't you tell me
who to throw out on the street.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.111
-What?
-Or maybe we should just tell people

17:51.195 --> 17:52.780
to stop being alcoholics.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.156
Not so simple, is it?

17:54.239 --> 17:56.992
Listen, these guys are much
better off sharing bedrooms

17:57.076 --> 17:59.161
in Bill's house
than sleeping in some alley.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.663
You're telling me
those are the only two choices?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.791
Crammed in Bill's house or homeless?

18:03.874 --> 18:04.917
I'm afraid so.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.543
Listen, Mr. Draper...

18:06.627 --> 18:08.128
Sorry, Hank, my ride is here.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
Uh, Dominga,
what's the Spanish word for "empathy"?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.049
<i>Empatía.</i>

18:13.717 --> 18:15.677
There you go.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.514
That's my little girl over there.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.016
That's mine over there.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.394
Oh. Aww.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.440
<i>♪ Don't stop believin' ♪</i>

18:28.982 --> 18:32.194
You gotta work the eighth step, man.
That's the key to success.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.488
She won't let me back in the house.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.575
Hank, tell me Draper had good news.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.622
-I'm an alcoholic.
-I know! I know!

18:44.414 --> 18:47.167
I'm just so tired, Hank.
And I'm so far behind.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.628
I haven't even had time
to collect the checks yet.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.546
What checks?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.756
The ones the guys get from the government.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.967
We have to get them signed
and sent over to Draper.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.553
Oh, and some of their hands
shake a little.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.595
Could you help 'em out?

18:58.679 --> 19:01.682
Draper gets 600 bucks a month
from each guy?

19:01.765 --> 19:04.268
And that's not enough
to keep Opportunity House open?

19:04.351 --> 19:07.020
I guess not. Damn bean counters.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.190
Bobby, I think today is the day.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.860
Sit down, Mom. We need to talk.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.697
I think we have to be honest
with ourselves.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.783
You're never gonna learn
how to ride a bike.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.827
-But I...
-It's over, Mom.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.664
Jesus knows you tried.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.125
Hey, it's me.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.085
Listen, I think we need
more big-ticket items

19:30.169 --> 19:31.128
for the silent auction.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.297
Remember, we're buying cows
for Haitians, here.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.966
Well, yeah, after we recoup our costs
for the goodie bags.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.724
I'm gonna have to call you back.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.476
Hey, Mr. Draper.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.271
Good of you to come over
and say hi to your new neighbors.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.981
Neighbors? What, what do you mean?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.775
This is the new-and-improved Bill's House.
We just rented it.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.987
Yeah, we figured this place
was a much better use of their money.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.407
So I had the guys sign their checks
over to Bill instead of you.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.783
What? You can't do that.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.076
Well, I already did.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.538
Now, they have plenty of bedrooms,
a rec area, a nice pool.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.665
Maybe some swim therapy, huh, Bill?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.167
They would really enjoy that.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.629
Oh, and, uh, you'll probably have
to check in on them every now and again.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.005
But you don't mind, right?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.758
People like us really, really care.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.384
Well, hey, I don't have time.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.470
I'm gonna be Rocking the Vote
for the next two months.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.180
Uh, you'll figure something out.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.934
Oh, you might want to warn your neighbors
about the smoke.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.311
And their basketball games
get kind of heated.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.647
Hey, brother, name's Mikey, feeling good.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.024
Happy as hell to meet you.
Got to fake it till you make it.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.155
-Boy, it sure is quiet.
-Yeah.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.574
I found a cigarette butt
in one of my planters

20:42.658 --> 20:43.742
and almost cried.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.578
-So how are the guys doing?
-Oh, they're great.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.789
I was over there today giving haircuts.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.832
I heard Mr. Draper
is starting construction

20:50.916 --> 20:52.459
on Opportunity House again.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.086
Yeah, I thought that might happen.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.462
Yo, man.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.761
Yep.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.179
Mm... Yup.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.639
Mmm-hmm.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.934
Man, my tolerance is way down.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.432
-<i>Went to a Spurs game,
long story short, lost my job.</i>
