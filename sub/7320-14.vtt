WEBVTT

00:14.833 --> 00:15.600
(elevator bell dings)

00:15.633 --> 00:17.700
(Meredith)
THERE'S THIS PERSON...

00:17.733 --> 00:18.567
***

00:18.600 --> 00:21.100
IN MY HEAD.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.433
SHE IS BRILLIANT, CAPABLE.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.267
SHE CAN DO CHEST TUBES
AND CRANIOTOMIES.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.100
SHE CAN RUN A CODE
WITHOUT FREAKING OUT.

00:28.133 --> 00:28.800
(giggles)

00:28.833 --> 00:30.667
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD SURGEON...

00:30.700 --> 00:33.100
MAYBE EVEN A GREAT SURGEON.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.033
SHE'S ME...

00:35.067 --> 00:37.500
ONLY SO MUCH BETTER.

00:37.533 --> 00:40.733
(sighs) THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

00:40.767 --> 00:43.167
REFLECTS WELL
ON SEATTLE GRACE.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.200
IS YANG GONNA HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT?

00:46.233 --> 00:48.400
I'D SAY SO.

00:48.433 --> 00:50.067
(sighs)

00:50.100 --> 00:51.833
EVERY TIME DEREK
WALKS INTO A ROOM,

00:51.867 --> 00:54.067
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HIS TONGUE...

00:54.100 --> 00:55.600
IN MY MOUTH.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.567
SO YOU THINK ABOUT
KISSING DEREK?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
IT'S MAKING SURGERY
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:59.633 --> 01:02.367
SO I NEED SOME THERAPY TOOLS
SO THAT I CAN MOVE ON.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.833
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO MOVE ON?
WELL, WE HAVE OUR FIFTH
CLINICAL TRIAL PATIENT TODAY,

01:05.867 --> 01:08.733
AND THE FIRST FOUR,
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT,

01:08.767 --> 01:11.533
BUT WE HAVEN'T SAVED ONE,
AND I REALLY WANT TO SAVE ONE.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.433
SO I CAN'T BE DISTRACTED
BY THINGS LIKE TONGUES.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.767
SO I NEED SOME TOOLS, NOW.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.700
YOU'RE HAVING FANTASIES
ABOUT DEREK.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.633
THE ONLY WAY
TO GET RID OF THEM

01:20.667 --> 01:23.833
IS TO REMIND YOURSELF
OF THE REALITY.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.767
THE KISSING'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN NOW

01:25.800 --> 01:27.333
BECAUSE HE'S WITH ROSE.

01:27.367 --> 01:30.533
POWERFUL STUFF--REALITY.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.367
(elevator bell dings)

01:32.400 --> 01:34.533
(whispering) HE'S WITH ROSE.
HE'S WITH ROSE.

01:34.567 --> 01:37.033
HE'S WITH ROSE.
HE'S WITH ROSE.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.433
(normal voice)
SORRY I'M LATE.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.000
JUST GETTING STARTED.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.700
HI, I'M DR. GREY.
JONATHAN EVETT. I'VE BEEN
TREATING DARREN OVER AT THE V.A.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.600
I'M SO GLAD THAT
YOU WERE ABLE TO GET HIM

01:45.633 --> 01:47.167
INTO THE CLINICAL TRIAL.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.467
SO YOU'RE GONNA INJECT
A VIRUS INTO MY SON'S BRAIN.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.367
NOT IN THE BRAIN, DAD.
IN THE TUMOR.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.767
THE THEORY IS THAT THE VIRUS
WILL ATTACK THE TUMOR

01:53.800 --> 01:55.367
AND SHRINK IT.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.467
STILL, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF RISK INVOLVED.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.167
THAT'S OKAY. HE SURVIVED
TWO TOURS IN AFGHANISTAN.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.833
HE'S USED TO RISK.
SIR.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.600
MR. COVINGTON.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.800
TODD.
YOUR DAD CALLED ME.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.700
WHAT'D YOU DO,
CALL MY WHOLE PLATOON, DAD?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.667
WELL, IF YOU'RE
GONNA BEAT THIS,

02:14.700 --> 02:17.167
YOU NEED YOUR FRIENDS
BY YOUR SIDE.

02:19.733 --> 02:22.233
(giggling)
DR. SLOAN.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.167
DR. BAILEY.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.567
DR. BAILEY'S BABY.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.067
IT APPEARS NURSE TANYA

02:28.100 --> 02:30.533
IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE
FOR YOUR LIPOSUCTION AT 10:00.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.400
SHALL I CANCEL THE PROCEDURE?

02:32.433 --> 02:34.333
NO, NO, NO.
GET ME ANOTHER NURSE.

02:34.367 --> 02:36.233
GET ME KATE. YEAH.

02:36.267 --> 02:39.367
(giggling)

02:39.400 --> 02:43.800
DR. TORRES, DR. SLOAN WOULD LIKE
TO USE NURSE KATE THIS MORNING.

02:43.833 --> 02:47.033
CURRENTLY, SHE'S SCHEDULED
FOR YOUR ARTHROPLASTY,

02:47.067 --> 02:49.700
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO MOVE IT BACK AN HOUR,

02:49.733 --> 02:51.767
PERHAPS SHE COULD DO BOTH.
(Mark) OW!

02:51.800 --> 02:53.467
(Callie giggles) OW.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.300
(laughs)

02:54.333 --> 02:56.467
DR. TORRES,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.733
YEAH, FINE. JUST AN HOUR LATER,
AN HOUR EARLIER. WHATEVER.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.700
HEY, TUCK.
DON'T JUDGE ME, BAILEY.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.633
HAS CRISTINA SEEN IT?
LET'S TAKE IT DOWN.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.267
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT DOWN.
TAKE IT DOWN. TAKE IT DOWN.
SHE NEVER HAS TO KNOW.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.267
(Meredith)
SHE'S GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.
WHO'S GONNA HEAR ABOUT WHAT?

03:09.300 --> 03:10.233
AH!

03:10.267 --> 03:13.600
IZZIE...(laughs)
MOVE YOUR HAND.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.633
(chuckles)
OH, COME ON. MOVE IT.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.600
GOOD FOR HIM.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.033
(Izzie)
NO ONE WINS THE HARPER AVERY.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.800
THAT IS SO WEIRD.

03:31.833 --> 03:35.067
WE KNOW SOMEONE
WHO WON THE HARPER AVERY.
HEY, TALK TO MEREDITH,

03:35.100 --> 03:37.700
SEE IF SHE'D BE OKAY IF REBECCA
MOVED IN FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
WHAT?

03:37.733 --> 03:40.400
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE GONNA
GET OUR OWN PLACE,

03:40.433 --> 03:42.700
BUT IT'S GONNA
TAKE ME A WHILE TO SAVE UP

03:42.733 --> 03:44.733
FOR A SECURITY DEPOSIT.
UH, SHE'S MARRIED.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.567
SHE'S LEAVING HER HUSBAND.
SHE'S TELLING HIM RIGHT NOW.
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT HER KID?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.500
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.133
IT'S A MESS RIGHT NOW,
BUT WE'RE FIGURING IT ALL OUT.

03:52.167 --> 03:53.367
ALEX, WAIT.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.033
SHE'S PREGNANT.
SHE'S KNOCKED UP.

03:55.067 --> 03:58.100
LOOK, JUST TALK TO MEREDITH.

03:58.133 --> 04:00.600
(Erica)
WHO WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT?

04:00.633 --> 04:02.033
UH, KYRA MARSHALL,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.567
HISTORY OF END-STAGE
CARDIOMYOPATHY AND C.O.P.D.,

04:04.600 --> 04:05.800
NOW AWAITING
A HEART TRANSPLANT,

04:05.833 --> 04:07.433
BUT HER ANTIBODY LEVELS
WERE SO ELEVATED,

04:07.467 --> 04:10.433
SHE WAS IN DANGER OF REJECTING
ANY DONOR HEART.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.300
SO HOW DID WE
COUNTERACT THAT?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.333
WE'VE BEEN GIVING HER
HIGH LEVELS OF CHEMOTHERAPY

04:14.367 --> 04:17.367
TO SUPPRESS HER IMMUNE SYSTEM.
AND WHAT PRECAUTIONS
HAVE WE TAKEN

04:17.400 --> 04:19.500
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE IS NOT
EXPOSED TO INFECTION?

04:19.533 --> 04:21.767
YANG, AM I BORING YOU?

04:21.800 --> 04:24.600
BECAUSE IF YOU'D RATHER SPEND
THE DAY IN THE MORGUE,

04:24.633 --> 04:26.200
I HAVE ABOUT 50 CADAVER HEARTS

04:26.233 --> 04:28.533
THAT NEED TO BE HARVESTED
FOR MY RESEARCH.

04:28.567 --> 04:31.067
SO KYRA MARSHALL'S PROTOCOLS--

04:31.100 --> 04:32.833
I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO THE MORGUE.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.767
THANK YOU.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.233
LET YANG BE AN EXAMPLE
TO ALL OF YOU.

04:37.267 --> 04:40.133
THERE IS NO SHAME
IN GRUNT WORK.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.333
NOW LET'S MEET OUR MOM
IN A PLASTIC BUBBLE.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.400
(gasping)
GET ME OUTTA HERE, LUCAS!

04:44.433 --> 04:46.667
(crying)
I NEED TO GET OUTTA HERE!

04:46.700 --> 04:48.700
GET THEM TO LET ME OUTTA HERE.

04:48.733 --> 04:50.700
HONEY, CALM DOWN.
YOU SAID I'D HAVE A HEART
IN THREE WEEKS,

04:50.733 --> 04:52.567
AND IT'S BEEN EIGHT.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.633
IT HAS BEEN EIGHT WEEKS WITHOUT
TOUCHING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.600
(crying and speaking
indistinctly)

04:58.633 --> 05:00.267
KYRA, LISTEN TO ME.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.467
NO! (gasping)

05:01.500 --> 05:03.400
KYRA, YOU NEED
TO LISTEN TO ME.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.400
I WANT TO LEAVE.

05:05.433 --> 05:09.700
I WANT TO HUG MY KIDS,
AND I WANT TO KISS MY HUSBAND.

05:09.733 --> 05:11.767
AND I W--
GOD, I'M GOING CRAZY IN HERE.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.533
KYRA, COME HERE.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.500
KYRA, TAKE MY HAND.
NO.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.467
KYRA, TAKE MY HAND.
(sobbing)

05:17.500 --> 05:19.667
(coughs and gasps)

05:19.700 --> 05:22.333
YOU ARE
GONNA LEAVE HERE SOON.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.533
THAT IS WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU.
WE HAVE A HEART FOR YOU.

05:25.567 --> 05:28.067
(coughs)

05:28.100 --> 05:30.167
(crying)

05:30.200 --> 05:33.033
WE HAVE A HEART.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
(Mark) YOU PAGED ME, CHIEF?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.833
YEAH,
HUMAN RESOURCES CALLED.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.533
AS OF THIS MORNING,

05:38.567 --> 05:40.467
THE NURSES ARE BOYCOTTING
YOUR SURGERIES.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.800
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
TO THE NURSES.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.733
WELL, NOTHING THAT CAN
GET US SUED.

05:44.767 --> 05:47.233
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DID, THEY
FELT STRONGLY ENOUGH ABOUT IT

05:47.267 --> 05:50.167
THAT THEY SENT
THEIR UNION REP.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.500
(woman speaking indistinctly)

05:52.533 --> 05:54.033
ADELE?

05:54.067 --> 05:55.733
WAIT, YOUR WIFE'S
THE UNION GOON?

05:55.767 --> 05:57.167
NURSE MEDIATOR, DR. SLOAN.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.800
AND YOU KNOW WAYNE SHEEHAN
FROM HUMAN RESOURCES.

05:59.833 --> 06:02.200
BUT HOW--
HOW DID YOU GET IN--

06:02.233 --> 06:03.833
ADELE USED TO BE A NURSE.

06:03.867 --> 06:07.033
APPARENTLY, SHE'S GOTTEN
BACK INTO THE FIELD.
I'M NOT JUST
A HOUSEWIFE ANYMORE.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.467
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS
ABOUT DR. SLOAN.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.200
COMPLAINTS THAT THIS HOSPITAL
HAS, UP UNTIL NOW, IGNORED.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.533
HEY, EVERYTHING I DID
WAS CONSENSUAL.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.600
IN FACT, SOME OF 'EM
EVEN BEGGED FOR IT.
SLOAN.

06:17.633 --> 06:20.767
(Wayne) NO FORMAL HARASSMENT
COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.133
HOWEVER, THE BOARD HAS DECIDED
TO AGGRESSIVELY PROTECT ITSELF

06:25.167 --> 06:27.700
FROM POSSIBLE FUTURE LITIGATION,

06:27.733 --> 06:30.067
SO AS OF TODAY,
IF A HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE

06:30.100 --> 06:33.333
IS HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYEE,

06:33.367 --> 06:36.233
THEY HAVE GOT TO REGISTER IT.

06:36.267 --> 06:39.100
IT'S CALLED "DATE AND TELL."
THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

06:39.133 --> 06:41.767
DO YOU WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU HAVE

06:41.800 --> 06:44.467
A $20 MILLION LAWSUIT
ON YOUR HANDS?
FILL OUT THE FORM.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.133
CHIEF--
SHUT UP AND FILL OUT
THE DAMN FORM.

06:47.167 --> 06:50.167
AND YOU, TOO, RICHARD.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.700
UH, DR. YANG,
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:59.733 --> 07:02.600
I MEAN, I-I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK BECAUSE YOU PASSED UP

07:02.633 --> 07:07.433
A REALLY AWESOME TRANSPLANT CASE
WITH DR. HAHN, AND I...

07:07.467 --> 07:09.700
UM...

07:09.733 --> 07:12.700
IS THIS ABOUT THE THING
WITH... WITH DR. BURKE?

07:12.733 --> 07:16.300
I-I KNOW THAT Y-YOU TWO
WERE TOGETHER AND...

07:24.133 --> 07:28.200
* I MADE IT THROUGH
THE WILDERNESS *

07:28.233 --> 07:31.733
* SOMEHOW I MADE IT THROUGH

07:31.767 --> 07:34.633
* DIDN'T KNOW HOW LOST I WAS

07:34.667 --> 07:38.200
* UNTIL I FOUND YOU

07:38.233 --> 07:39.833
* I WAS BEAT

07:39.867 --> 07:40.800
UM...

07:40.833 --> 07:41.800
* INCOMPLETE

07:41.833 --> 07:44.267
SHOULD I BE DOING SOMETHING?
* I'D BEEN HAD

07:44.300 --> 07:46.467
CAN I HELP YOU IN--
* I WAS SAD AND BLUE

07:46.500 --> 07:49.667
* BUT YOU MADE ME FEEL

07:49.700 --> 07:53.400
* YEAH, YOU MADE ME FEEL

07:53.433 --> 07:57.100
* SHINY AND NEW

07:57.133 --> 07:59.500
* LIKE A VIRGIN

07:59.533 --> 08:00.700
* HEY

08:00.733 --> 08:02.233
(both) * TOUCHED FOR

08:02.267 --> 08:03.700
* THE VERY FIRST TIME

08:03.733 --> 08:06.600
* LIKE A VIR--

08:08.233 --> 08:11.200
(clears throat)

08:11.233 --> 08:13.400
I'LL JUST GO UPSTAIRS
AND GO CHARTING. I...

08:16.600 --> 08:21.100
* LIKE A VIRGIN

08:21.133 --> 08:23.833
LOOK, IF YOU NEEDED MORE MONEY,
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS--

08:23.867 --> 08:26.733
I DON'T NEED MORE MONEY.
I HAVE 50% OF YOURS.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.767
WHAT I NEED
IS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.233
I'M WORKING. I'M LOVING IT.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.233
I'VE CHANGED.

08:33.267 --> 08:35.200
UH, I'VE CHANGED, TOO.

08:35.233 --> 08:37.600
HOW?
I'M SPENDING
MORE TIME AT HOME.

08:37.633 --> 08:39.767
(scoffs)
I'M--I'M DELEGATING.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.533
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

08:41.567 --> 08:45.067
NO, NO. I'VE--I'VE GOTTEN
MYSELF, UH, AN INTERN.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.733
THE CHIEF'S INTERN.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.300
MM.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.700
CHANGE...

08:52.733 --> 08:54.667
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.267
(Richard) O'MALLEY.
(George) YES, SIR.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.733
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU,
O'MALLEY,

08:58.767 --> 09:01.067
AND FRANKLY, I'M WORRIED.

09:01.100 --> 09:05.033
A GUY LIKE YOU
CAN'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

09:05.067 --> 09:08.400
A GUY LIKE YOU
NEEDS A CHALLENGE,

09:08.433 --> 09:10.033
NEEDS CHANGE.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.667
WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

09:11.700 --> 09:13.600
I HAVE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE UNCHALLENGED.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.467
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT
BEING MY INTERN?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.600
THE CHIEF'S INTERN.
THE CHIEF'S INTERN?

09:18.633 --> 09:20.633
GEORGE O'MALLEY...

09:20.667 --> 09:22.333
INTERN TO THE CHIEF.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.267
(whispers) GEORGE O'MALLEY,
INTERN TO THE CHIEF.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.667
(normal voice)
IS THAT EVEN A REAL THING?

09:25.700 --> 09:29.200
WE NEED TO GET AGGRESSIVE
WITH THE VIRUS.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.667
IF WE INJECT
THE TUMOR IN TWO SITES,

09:31.700 --> 09:36.267
WE CAN ACTUALLY SATURATE IT
AND HAVE A REAL IMPACT.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.733
OKAY, NOW NEEDLE NUMBER ONE

09:38.767 --> 09:42.333
WILL GO INTO THE TUMOR HERE.

09:42.367 --> 09:46.200
NEEDLE NUMBER TWO
GOES RIGHT HERE.

09:46.233 --> 09:48.133
NOW FOR THE VIRUS
TO TAKE FULL EFFECT,

09:48.167 --> 09:51.267
WE NEED TO INJECT IT
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
THE SAME TIME.
MM-HMM.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.733
YOU'RE NEEDLE NUMBER TWO.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.567
WE'RE GONNA PRACTICE.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.500
***

10:00.533 --> 10:03.767
NOW... WE'LL USE
THE FLUORESCEIN

10:03.800 --> 10:07.667
TO HELP US ISOLATE THE TUMOR
FROM THE SURROUNDING TISSUE.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.733
***

10:12.733 --> 10:15.400
OKAY.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.467
NOW REMEMBER...

10:17.500 --> 10:20.333
WE HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY IN SYNC.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.533
OKAY? LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.033
(whispers) HE'S WITH ROSE,
HE'S WITH ROSE,

10:26.067 --> 10:28.567
HE'S WITH ROSE,
HE'S WITH ROSE.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.367
DO YOU LIKE PRINCESSES?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.333
(chuckles)

10:32.367 --> 10:33.767
UM, YEAH, SURE.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.100
WHEN YOU TAKE OUT MOMMY'S
BROKEN HEART, WHAT HAPPENS?

10:37.133 --> 10:39.267
WELL, WE'RE GONNA PUT HER
ON A HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.233
UH, IT'S LIKE WITH SNOW WHITE,

10:41.267 --> 10:43.167
WHEN, UH, SHE EATS
THE POISON APPLE

10:43.200 --> 10:45.133
AND SHE DIES FOR A WHILE,
BUT SHE'S NOT REALLY DEAD.

10:45.167 --> 10:47.700
IT'S LIKE THAT.
MY MOM'S GONNA BE DEAD?

10:47.733 --> 10:50.233
(girl) SNOW WHITE DIES?

10:50.267 --> 10:53.100
(girls crying)
WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE,
YOU SKIP OVER THE SCARY PARTS.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.433
MM. I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:54.467 --> 10:58.200
IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

10:58.233 --> 11:00.400
(girls continue crying)

11:00.433 --> 11:03.067
DR. BAILEY, IF I CAN'T
GET A HOLD OF MY PATIENT,

11:03.100 --> 11:06.133
IS IT OKAY TO GIVE
HER TEST RESULTS TO HER FRIEND?
NO!

11:06.167 --> 11:08.600
WHAT IF HER FRIEND IS
A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,

11:08.633 --> 11:10.333
AND HE'S CHANGING
HIS WHOLE LIFE FOR HER

11:10.367 --> 11:12.267
BECAUSE HE THINKS
SHE'S PREGNANT, AND SHE'S NOT.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
STEVENS, YOU WANT TO WIN
YOURSELF A HARPER AVERY,

11:14.233 --> 11:16.133
YOU NEED TO MASTER
THE BASICS OF PRIVACY.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.067
THE CHIEF NEEDS TO KNOW
WHO YOU'VE SLEPT WITH

11:18.100 --> 11:20.300
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
BE THOROUGH.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.667
THE CHIEF NEEDS TO KNOW
WHO YOU'VE SLEPT WITH

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
BE THOROUGH.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.200
THE CHIEF NEEDS TO KNOW...
WHO YOU'VE SLEPT WITH

11:26.233 --> 11:29.733
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
(lowers voice) BE THOROUGH.
THIS IS NO ONE'S BUSINESS.

11:29.767 --> 11:32.700
(normal voice)
UH, IT'S THE CHIEF'S BUSINESS,

11:32.733 --> 11:35.033
SO IT'S MY BUSINESS.
I'M THE CHIEF'S INTERN.
LET ME SEE THAT.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.133
OH. (whispers) THE CHIEF SAID
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

11:37.167 --> 11:39.133
IN THE WHOLE HOSPITAL
WHO IS EXEMPT.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.467
(normal voice)
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.433
UH-HUH.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.500
UM...

11:43.533 --> 11:47.667
W-WHAT--WHAT DO THEY MEAN
BY "SEXUAL RELATIONS"?

11:47.700 --> 11:50.433
THERE ARE LEVELS...

11:50.467 --> 11:52.533
OF... (whispers) INTIMACY.

11:52.567 --> 11:55.267
WELL... THEY DON'T NEED
TO KNOW THE...

11:55.300 --> 11:57.600
THEY JUST WANT
TO KNOW THE...

11:57.633 --> 12:01.067
H-HIGHEST LEVEL.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.133
OKAY, THEN.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.700
UM, I WON'T NEED
ONE OF THESE.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.033
YOU...

12:08.067 --> 12:09.733
OH.

12:09.767 --> 12:10.767
(chuckles)

12:10.800 --> 12:12.300
S--OKAY. SURE.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.033
I JUST DON'T WANNA
TURN THIS BACK...

12:15.067 --> 12:16.500
FREAK.

12:16.533 --> 12:19.267
I AM NOT A...
I AM THE CHIEF'S INTERN.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.300
MM-HMM. OKAY.
THAT'S NOT A REAL JOB.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.200
OKAY, I JUST NEED YOUR FORM
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
HMM.

12:24.233 --> 12:28.133
(Erica) IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE A PENIS, ISN'T IT?

12:28.167 --> 12:29.667
UM...

12:29.700 --> 12:31.500
I PUBLISH MORE.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.167
I DO DOUBLE THE RESEARCH.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.167
I DESERVE THIS
MORE THAN BURKE.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.633
IT'S A BIG MEN'S CLUB,
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.533
HUH. I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
YOU WERE BEING CONSIDERED.

12:40.567 --> 12:43.067
I WASN'T GONNA MENTION IT
UNTIL I WON.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.833
THEN I WAS GONNA BE
ALL NONCHALANT,

12:44.867 --> 12:46.767
LIKE AWARDS
DON'T MATTER TO ME.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.133
(laughs) MM.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.067
NOW BURKE'S GONE
AND RUINED MY WHOLE ACT.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.800
YOU WANT TO MEET ME AT JOE'S
TONIGHT? WE CAN TRASH-TALK HIM.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.333
(elevator bell dings)

12:54.367 --> 12:57.667
OH. I CAN'T.
I HAVE THIS OTHER THING.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.367
UH, HEY, CAN YOU, UH,
CAN YOU TALK TO THE NURSES?

13:00.400 --> 13:03.267
I NEED SOMEONE TO, UH, TELL 'EM
TO CALL OFF THE BOYCOTT,

13:03.300 --> 13:05.200
TELL 'EM I'M A GOOD GUY.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.700
(whispers) WE DON'T THINK
YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.
(laughs)

13:07.733 --> 13:09.633
DR. TORRES THINKS
I'M A GOOD GUY.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.600
(slaps bottom)
DON'T YOU, CALLIE?

13:11.633 --> 13:13.233
UM...

13:13.267 --> 13:15.033
(elevator bell dings)

13:15.067 --> 13:18.133
(chuckles)

13:19.867 --> 13:22.733
(whispers)
ON CALL ROOM. NOW.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.633
SO WHAT'S THE RECOVERY PERIOD
FOR BRAIN SURGERY?

13:25.667 --> 13:29.333
IT VARIES, BUT USUALLY
AT LEAST FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.733
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'LL BE STUCK WITH ME

13:31.767 --> 13:34.267
FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.
YOU DEPLOY
IN FIVE DAYS, MAN.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.433
THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW
YOU HAD A BRAIN TUMOR.
NO, NO. DON'T SCREW THIS UP
FOR YOURSELF.

13:37.467 --> 13:40.133
YOU'RE A SOLDIER.
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.533
BESIDES, I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN
GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH SURGERY.

13:42.567 --> 13:46.333
OKAY? SO--
COOL. THEN I'LL BE GOOD
TO GO IN ABOUT FIVE DAYS.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.800
(whispers) DUDE,
WHY DID YOU COME, MAN?

13:51.833 --> 13:54.800
HOW COULD I NOT?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.033
(scoffs)

14:05.067 --> 14:07.467
GOD, YOU'RE SO PARANOID.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.567
(door opens)

14:29.600 --> 14:31.767
(Meredith) MR. COVINGTON.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.067
GET OUT.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.500
DON'T MAKE ME THROW YOU OUT.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.033
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:49.067 --> 14:52.133
NOTHING'S WRONG, SIR.

14:52.167 --> 14:54.600
NOTHING AT ALL.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
THANK YOU FOR
THE, UH, CONSULT, DR. SLOAN.

15:08.433 --> 15:09.633
(elevator bell dings)

15:09.667 --> 15:12.467
NO.
I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.167
I'M NOT TALKING
TO THE NURSES FOR YOU.
YOU'RE DATING MY BEST FRIEND.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.100
NO.
COME ON, ROSE.
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.567
TELL 'EM I'M A GOOD GUY,

15:18.600 --> 15:21.100
A GUY WHO HAPPENS TO BE
MIND-BLOWINGLY GOOD AT SEX.

15:21.133 --> 15:23.833
YEAH, SEE, BUT THAT,
ALL THE TALK ABOUT ALL THE SEX?

15:23.867 --> 15:27.433
IT'S NOT WHAT I THINK OF
AS GOOD-GUY BEHAVIOR.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.367
I HATE WOMEN LIKE YOU.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.500
YOU STRING GUYS ALONG,
ACTING LIKE SEX IS SOME PRIZE,

15:32.533 --> 15:34.267
WHEN REALLY,
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID

15:34.300 --> 15:37.300
THAT ONCE YOU GIVE IT UP,
HE'LL LOSE INTEREST.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.600
YOU KNOW,
MY DAD'S NOT A BAD GUY.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.667
HE'S JUST... A SOLDIER.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.600
WE'RE ALL SOLDIERS.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.333
TODD'S DOWN IN THE LOBBY.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.467
(sighs)

15:52.500 --> 15:54.400
HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT.

15:54.433 --> 15:55.733
HE SHOULD JUST GO,

15:55.767 --> 15:57.667
PUT ME OUT OF HIS MIND
AND JUST--

15:57.700 --> 16:01.267
WELL, THAT'S NOT
SO EASY TO DO.
WELL, IT'D BE BETTER
FOR EVERYONE,

16:01.300 --> 16:02.867
ESPECIALLY WITH DR. EVETT
HANGING AROUND.

16:02.900 --> 16:06.033
TODD CAN'T RISK
GETTING OUTTED. HE--
IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU
EVEN HAVE TO WORRY

16:06.067 --> 16:08.533
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL."

16:08.567 --> 16:11.100
HEY, I KNEW THE DEAL
WHEN I SIGNED ON.

16:12.867 --> 16:16.467
YOU KEEP YOUR PERSONAL LIFE
SEPARATE FROM YOUR WORK LIFE.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.767
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT...

16:17.800 --> 16:21.633
I'D MEET MY PERSONAL LIFE
AT WORK.

16:23.433 --> 16:26.700
I CAN STILL GO GET TODD.

16:26.733 --> 16:29.267
NO, I-I CAN'T.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.267
MY DAD--I CAN'T.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.367
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.567
BRAVE SOLDIER WHO CAN'T EVEN
STEP UP TO HIS OWN FATHER.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.600
I WAS THINKING,
THIS IS HARD.

16:44.633 --> 16:47.333
THE GAY PART
OR THE TUMOR PART?

16:47.367 --> 16:52.133
THE WHOLE PART.

20:04.067 --> 20:08.500
***

20:08.533 --> 20:10.667
NO.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.500
ARE YOU SURE?

20:12.533 --> 20:15.533
***

20:18.200 --> 20:19.367
NO.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.300
***

20:23.333 --> 20:26.100
(Darren) LET'S JUST GO.

20:26.133 --> 20:29.800
***

20:37.700 --> 20:40.567
DONOR HEART'S ON ITS WAY.

20:43.733 --> 20:46.667
CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW YOU MUST FEEL

20:46.700 --> 20:47.667
ABOUT BURKE'S AWARD.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.067
YOU ACTUALLY HELPED HIM
WITH ALL THAT RESEARCH.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.300
HE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION YOU
IN THE ARTICLE.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.233
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S NO SURPRISE.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.300
HIS ARROGANCE IS LEGENDARY.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.733
HUH. THOUGHT WE FINALLY HAD
SOME COMMON GROUND.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.200
GOOD FOR YOU...

21:10.233 --> 21:13.100
REFUSING TO TRASH HIM,
RISING ABOVE.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.433
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

21:14.467 --> 21:19.067
I AM GOING TO FOLLOW
YOUR EXAMPLE, YANG.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.100
CONGRATULATIONS, PRESTON.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.033
I WISH YOU WELL.

21:23.067 --> 21:26.067
(siren wailing)

21:28.233 --> 21:31.100
(Derek)
OKAY, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.

21:31.133 --> 21:33.600
WE HAVE TO BE IN TOTAL SYNC

21:33.633 --> 21:36.133
FOR THE VIRUS TO HAVE
MAXIMUM INFILTRATION.

21:36.167 --> 21:37.367
OKAY?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.733
READY?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.467
GO.

21:50.133 --> 21:52.200
EASY. SLOW DOWN.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.133
EASY.
SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.

21:54.167 --> 21:55.833
SLOW DOWN. LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

21:55.867 --> 21:58.633
DON'T--DON'T LOOK
AT THE MACHINE. LOOK AT ME.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.467
SLOWLY.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.367
THAT'S IT.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.300
THAT'S IT.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.700
(monitor beeps)

22:15.733 --> 22:18.033
THE VIRUS IS IN.

22:19.533 --> 22:21.500
(applause)

22:21.533 --> 22:23.800
WE'RE STANDING ON THE MOON,
DR. GREY.

22:26.633 --> 22:29.800
I JUST WANTED TO DROP OFF
THE FORM MYSELF.

22:29.833 --> 22:32.067
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
YOU MIGHT HAVE.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.067
THERE ARE INTERNS
LISTED ON THIS FORM.

22:34.100 --> 22:37.600
MM. I REQUIRE THE ENERGY
OF YOUTH.

22:37.633 --> 22:39.600
DR. SHEPHERD WAS JUST
A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS,

22:39.633 --> 22:41.167
FOR BOTH OF US.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.767
DR. SLOAN?

22:42.800 --> 22:45.233
OH, THAT WAS MANY MOMENTS,
IN ON CALL ROOMS.

22:45.267 --> 22:46.767
VERY HOT.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.300
MM. STEAMY.

22:48.333 --> 22:52.133
ALL RIGHT, DR. BAILEY,
I GET THE JOKE, OKAY?
SEE? THIS IS A JOKE TO YOU.

22:52.167 --> 22:54.133
I AM A SINGLE WOMAN.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.400
I'VE BEEN A SINGLE WOMAN
FOR SOME TIME NOW,

22:56.433 --> 23:00.733
BUT THE VERY IDEA THAT I
COULD HAVE A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER--

23:00.767 --> 23:03.700
A CONSENSUAL SEXUAL ENCOUNTER--
IS A JOKE TO YOU?

23:03.733 --> 23:06.500
DR. BAILEY, I NEVER--
SO MUCH SO THAT YOU WOULD
SINGLE ME OUT

23:06.533 --> 23:09.533
OF THIS ENTIRE HOSPITAL
AS THE ONE PERSON

23:09.567 --> 23:12.433
WHO COULDN'T INTEREST
A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX?

23:12.467 --> 23:14.433
IT'S... IT'S JUST--

23:14.467 --> 23:16.600
IT'S HARASSMENT.
ADELE.

23:16.633 --> 23:18.767
JUST SHAME ON YOU, SIR.
OW!

23:18.800 --> 23:21.433
JUST SHAME ON YOU!

23:21.467 --> 23:23.800
LIQUIDS FOR YOUR FEVER.
DRINK THIS.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.200
I'M FINE.
YOU'RE RUN-DOWN.

23:25.233 --> 23:28.767
I'M FINE.
YOU'RE TAKING ON TOO MUCH.
SHE CAN'T JUST MOVE UP HERE.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.533
YOU GUYS NEED TO SLOW DOWN
AND JUST--
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

23:31.567 --> 23:33.800
YOU CAN'T PASS A BABY
ON THE STREET WITHOUT STOPPING.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.233
THE ONLY FRIGGIN' BABY
IN THE WORLD

23:36.267 --> 23:38.667
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IS MINE.
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY
FOR YOU. IT'S JUST--

23:38.700 --> 23:40.633
WHAT?

23:40.667 --> 23:42.567
NOTHING.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.100
(clears throat)

23:50.733 --> 23:53.067
SO ARE WE ON FOR TONIGHT,

23:53.100 --> 23:54.533
OR WHAT?

23:54.567 --> 23:55.800
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

23:55.833 --> 23:58.633
I MEAN, I TOLD YOU,
I HAVE THIS OTHER THING.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.267
I DON'T, UH...

24:04.300 --> 24:05.600
MAKE FRIENDS EASILY.

24:05.633 --> 24:07.833
I'M AWKWARD

24:07.867 --> 24:09.767
AND I'M BAD AT SMALL TALK,

24:09.800 --> 24:12.800
AND I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW,

24:12.833 --> 24:16.500
BUT...
I MADE FRIENDS WITH YOU.

24:16.533 --> 24:20.500
AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS "THING,"
AND THAT THING IS SLOAN.

24:20.533 --> 24:23.333
ARE YOU MAD THAT I'M SLEEPING
WITH MARK SLOAN?

24:23.367 --> 24:25.533
I'M NOT MAD THAT YOU'RE
SLEEPING WITH SLOAN.

24:25.567 --> 24:28.400
I'M MAD THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH SLOAN.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.167
I'M MAD AT YOU...

24:30.200 --> 24:31.800
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TELLING ME

24:31.833 --> 24:33.733
AND ADMITTING THAT YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

24:33.767 --> 24:35.667
WHO GOES ALL POOFY
WHEN SHE GETS A BOYFRIEND,

24:35.700 --> 24:37.133
YOU DISAPPEAR...

24:37.167 --> 24:39.367
WITH YOUR "THING."

24:42.633 --> 24:45.667
I DON'T MAKE FRIENDS EASILY.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.733
THAT WAS GREAT.

24:55.767 --> 24:57.700
TOTALLY IN SYNC,
LIKE WE WERE ONE PERSON.

24:57.733 --> 24:59.633
YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.
YOU DID GREAT.

MONITORED OVERNIGHT,

25:07.700 --> 25:08.800
SO...
MM-HMM.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.533
IF YOU JUST TELL ME

25:11.567 --> 25:13.533
I MEAN, WE COULD--

25:18.200 --> 25:19.133

SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE
BREATHING.

26:48.433 --> 26:51.333
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

I THINK HER LUNG HAS DROPPED.
PAGE HAHN.

YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

27:01.700 --> 27:04.500
YOU CAN'T BREAK
THE ISOLATION BARRIER.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.667
(beeping continues)

27:08.167 --> 27:10.367
MR. MARSHALL, YOU NEED
TO GET YOUR KIDS OUTTA HERE.
IS SHE DYING?

27:10.400 --> 27:14.233

A WORD WITH YOU PRIVATELY?

28:04.533 --> 28:07.333
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

28:07.367 --> 28:10.133
I GAVE UP
A MAJOR SURGERY TODAY,

28:10.167 --> 28:13.667
AND ALL MY FRIENDS THINK
I'M A BROWNNOSING PERV.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.567
BUT I... IT WAS WORTH IT

28:15.600 --> 28:17.567

31:36.300 --> 31:38.200
I NOTICED
YOU DIDN'T TURN YOURS IN.

31:38.233 --> 31:39.567
NO, NO, SIR.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.100
WELL, I NEED YOU TO.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.800
THE HOSPITAL IS STILL LIABLE

31:42.833 --> 31:46.433
EVEN THOUGH DR. BURKE
ISN'T HERE.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.700
THERE.

32:03.733 --> 32:07.400
MY SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP--
PRESTON BURKE--ON PAPER.

32:07.433 --> 32:08.333
SATISFIED?

32:08.367 --> 32:10.267
(Richard) I KNOW
THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.733
NO, IT'S NOT DIFFICULT, SIR.
IT IS SIMPLE.

32:12.767 --> 32:14.667
BURKE IS NOT HERE.
HE'S GONE.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.600
AND HE'S THE BETTER FOR IT.

32:16.633 --> 32:18.533
HE'S WINNING
THE HARPER AVERY AWARD

32:18.567 --> 32:20.467
AND BEING CELEBRATED
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.667
THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT.
HE'S OUT THERE.

32:22.700 --> 32:27.533
AND I'M HERE...
WHERE EVERYTHING IS THE SAME.

32:27.567 --> 32:29.433
I STILL LIVE IN HIS APARTMENT,

32:29.467 --> 32:31.367
I WALK THE SAME HALLS
OF THIS HOSPITAL,

32:31.400 --> 32:35.100
I WEAR THE SAME SCRUBS,
AND EVEN THAT IS NOT DIFFICULT.

32:35.133 --> 32:36.433
THIS IS WHERE I AM.

32:36.467 --> 32:40.100
THIS IS WHERE I CHOOSE TO BE.

32:40.133 --> 32:41.733
BUT, SIR...

32:41.767 --> 32:44.433
WHEN HIS HAND WAS SHAKING,

32:44.467 --> 32:46.767
I PERFORMED HIS SURGERIES,

32:46.800 --> 32:49.600
I KEPT HIS SECRETS,
I NURSED HIS PRIDE.

32:49.633 --> 32:52.333
YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT,
AND HE KNOWS IT.

32:52.367 --> 32:54.467
HE KNOWS IT.

32:56.067 --> 32:58.433
AND YET, NOWHERE
IN THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE

32:58.467 --> 33:00.467
DOES MY NAME APPEAR.

33:03.367 --> 33:08.700
I AM THE UNSEEN HAND
TO HIS BRILLIANCE.

33:08.733 --> 33:10.367
EXCUSE ME.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.467
(clears throat)

33:12.500 --> 33:16.533
AND YET,
WHILE EVERYTHING IS... (sighs)

33:16.567 --> 33:21.333
THE SAME,
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFERENT.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.367
NOW I'M LUCKY
IF I GET TO HOLD A CLAMP.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.467
HAHN TREATS ME LIKE...

33:30.867 --> 33:33.400
I WAS HIS HAND,

33:33.433 --> 33:36.233
AND NOW I'M A GHOST.

33:36.267 --> 33:40.300
THAT'S NOT DIFFICULT.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.800
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.733
I KNOW EVERYBODY
IS PROUD OF HIM,

33:44.767 --> 33:47.200
BUT I'M NOT.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.467
AND I DO NOT WISH HIM WELL.

33:51.267 --> 33:53.700
THIS BOYCOTT
HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.

33:53.733 --> 33:55.633
NOW, OKAY,
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE,

33:55.667 --> 34:01.500
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER
MY THOUGHTS ON DR. SLOAN.

34:01.533 --> 34:03.167
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.667
UH, THIS MAN IS A WHORE,

34:06.700 --> 34:10.267
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WHORE,
WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE A WHORE.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.733
BUT, I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT A SECRET.

34:11.767 --> 34:13.800
HE'S NOT KEEPING IT HIDDEN.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.633
YOU ALL KNEW WHO HE WAS BEFORE
YOU GOT INVOLVED WITH HIM.

34:16.667 --> 34:18.500
AND NOW YOU WANT TO BE ALL

34:18.533 --> 34:21.033
"WOE IS ME, HE DOESN'T CALL ME
BACK, HE'S DATING OTHER WOMEN."

34:21.067 --> 34:24.067
HE'S NASTY,
BUT HE'S A DOCTOR HERE

34:24.100 --> 34:26.033
AND A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

34:26.067 --> 34:30.400
SO LET US ALL CLOSE OUR KNEES
AND GET BACK TO OUR JOBS

34:30.433 --> 34:33.067
SO HE CAN GET BACK TO HIS JOB

34:33.100 --> 34:35.400
AND HELP THE PEOPLE
THAT REALLY NEED IT.

34:35.433 --> 34:37.500
(elevator bell dings)

34:39.367 --> 34:41.267
DISPERSE.

34:48.133 --> 34:50.267
(Kyra) OH, MY GOD.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.800
HI, MY BABY.

34:56.067 --> 34:58.067
(laughs)

35:00.267 --> 35:03.100
(Marshalls laughing)

35:03.133 --> 35:05.400
I HEARD. YOU DID GREAT.

35:07.733 --> 35:11.367
ALEX.
LOOK, YOU THINK I'M SCUM.
YOU THINK I CAN'T DO THIS.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.533
BUT IT'S MY KID, IZZIE,
MY KID,

35:13.567 --> 35:15.900
AND WHAT YOU THINK
DOESN'T MATTER.

35:19.633 --> 35:24.133
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
A MILITARY BURIAL.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.100
IT WAS A GOOD DAY...

36:15.133 --> 36:17.033
HEADING HOME.

36:17.067 --> 36:20.000
HEADING HOME EARLY.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.500
MAYBE YOU HAVE CHANGED.

36:27.633 --> 36:29.700
THAT'S A NICE BLOUSE.

36:29.733 --> 36:32.333
***

36:32.367 --> 36:36.300
MAYBE EVEN A GREAT DAY.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.367
GOOD NIGHT.
DID YOU EVER GET IN TOUCH
WITH THAT PATIENT?

36:38.400 --> 36:40.167
NO.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.533
DID YOU TELL HER FRIEND?

36:41.567 --> 36:44.433
NO.

36:44.467 --> 36:46.567
***

36:46.600 --> 36:48.500
(sighs) EVEN THOUGH
IT KILLED ME,

36:48.533 --> 36:50.300
I DIDN'T TELL.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.733
YOU'RE GROWING, STEVENS.

36:51.767 --> 36:55.300
YEAH, WELL,
I WISH IT WOULD STOP.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.533
***

36:57.567 --> 37:00.433
MY HUSBAND IS OUT ON A DATE...

37:00.467 --> 37:02.433
RIGHT NOW.

37:02.467 --> 37:04.600
ON A DATE.

37:04.633 --> 37:07.200
***

37:07.233 --> 37:09.367
I WAS A GOOD DOCTOR...

37:09.400 --> 37:12.100
***

37:12.133 --> 37:14.333
EVEN WHEN IT WAS HARD.

37:14.367 --> 37:17.167
I WAS THE ME IN MY HEAD.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.100
I JUST CALLED
THREE OF MY EX-BOYFRIENDS

37:19.133 --> 37:21.533
TO FIND OUT
HOW UNFORGETTABLE I AM.

37:21.567 --> 37:24.800
I LEFT MESSAGES.
I'M SURE THEY'LL CALL ME BACK.

37:24.833 --> 37:28.267
SO YOU MADE A MISTAKE
AND YOU SLEPT WITH ALEX?

37:28.300 --> 37:31.233
NO ONE
HAS MADE MORE MISTAKES

37:31.267 --> 37:34.167
OR SLEPT WITH
MORE INAPPROPRIATE PEOPLE

37:34.200 --> 37:37.500
OR BEEN MORE PUBLICLY HUMILIATED
THAN ME.

37:37.533 --> 37:40.167
LET ME BE AN INSPIRATION.
(chuckles)

37:40.200 --> 37:43.067
LOOK AT ME--
I AM THE CHIEF'S INTERN.

37:43.100 --> 37:44.600
I AM THE MAN

37:44.633 --> 37:47.133
AT THE RIGHT HAND...

37:47.167 --> 37:48.733
OF THE MAN.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.667
WOW.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.800
(Callie) OKAY,
I'VE BEEN AVOIDING YOU.

37:52.833 --> 37:56.167
BUT... WHEN SHE WAS HERE,
ADDISON SAID--

37:56.200 --> 37:57.767
WELL, SHE IMPLIED

37:57.800 --> 38:00.733
THAT--THAT, WELL, WE--
THAT I--THAT I WAS...

38:00.767 --> 38:04.367
THAT... UM...

38:04.400 --> 38:05.633
***

38:05.667 --> 38:07.600
YOU AND I
MIGHT BE LESBIANS.

38:07.633 --> 38:10.733
***

38:10.767 --> 38:12.400
(laughs)

38:12.433 --> 38:15.567
(laughing)

38:15.600 --> 38:18.600
***

38:20.667 --> 38:22.600
(laughs)
(laughs)

38:22.633 --> 38:24.700
THERE WAS A MOMENT
WHEN I THOUGHT...

38:24.733 --> 38:27.167
I CAN'T DO THIS.

38:27.200 --> 38:31.267
***

38:31.300 --> 38:33.600
WELL, I'M GLAD SOME THINGS
HAVEN'T CHANGED.

38:33.633 --> 38:34.533
(laughing)

38:34.567 --> 38:36.100
(laughing)

38:36.133 --> 38:38.167
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.367
THE MOST REFINED,
PROFESSIONAL,

38:39.400 --> 38:41.300
LADYLIKE DOCTOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL

38:41.333 --> 38:43.667
CAME TO MY DEFENSE TONIGHT.

38:43.700 --> 38:47.433
THE BEST SHE COULD COME UP WITH
WAS "HE'S A WHORE."

38:47.467 --> 38:49.600
I'M A WHORE.

38:49.633 --> 38:52.167
I SLEPT WITH HER.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.500
THE WHOLE TIME,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MEREDITH.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.433
WHO'S THE BIGGER WHORE?

38:57.467 --> 38:59.767
BUT I CLOSED MY EYES...

38:59.800 --> 39:02.133
AND IMAGINED MYSELF DOING IT.

39:02.167 --> 39:04.067
***

39:04.100 --> 39:06.067
AND I DID.

39:06.100 --> 39:08.833
I BLOCKED OUT THE FEAR...

39:08.867 --> 39:12.267
AND I DID IT.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.200
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DAY.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.133
***

39:17.167 --> 39:19.067
LOOK,
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS

39:19.100 --> 39:20.833
BECAUSE YOUR INSURANCE
ONLY COVERS 20 SESSIONS,

39:20.867 --> 39:23.467
AND I FEEL WE SHOULD GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.667
THAT WAS A LOAD OF CRAP.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.500
IT WAS NOT A GOOD DAY.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.467
YOUR PATIENT DIED ALONE,
UNABLE TO TELL

39:31.500 --> 39:33.367
THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE
HOW HE FELT.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.300
YEAH, BUT HE DID IT
FOR HIS BOYFRIEND.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.800
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY THINK
IT WAS KIND OF HEROIC.
IT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.667
STOP SAYING THAT.
LOOK, LET ME DRAW
THE PARALLELS FOR YOU.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.233
THE TRAGIC PATIENT
DIES ALONE

39:43.267 --> 39:47.167
WHILE THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE
IS LITERALLY IN THE NEXT ROOM.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.500
THAT'S YOU.

39:48.533 --> 39:50.767
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:50.800 --> 39:52.700
I'M NOT DYING ALONE.
OH, BUT I THINK YOU ARE.

39:52.733 --> 39:55.200
AND YOU'RE--YOU'RE TELLING
YOURSELF YOU'RE A HERO,

39:55.233 --> 39:57.667
WHEN IN REALITY,
ALL YOU ARE IS ALONE.

39:57.700 --> 40:00.700
THAT IS A LOAD OF CRAP.
HE'S WITH ROSE.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.667
(sighs)

40:02.700 --> 40:06.133
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M...
NOT GONNA DO THIS.

40:06.167 --> 40:07.667
HE'S WITH ROSE.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?

40:07.700 --> 40:10.567
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THAT SENTENCE--

40:10.600 --> 40:13.233
"HE'S WITH ROSE"--
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET ANYWHERE.

40:13.267 --> 40:15.633
HE'S WITH ROSE.
OKAY! SO HE'S WITH ROSE.
SO WHAT?

40:15.667 --> 40:18.533
AND IF HE'S WITH ROSE,
THAT MEANS HE'S NOT WITH YOU.

40:18.567 --> 40:21.767
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHY HE'S NOT WITH YOU?

40:21.800 --> 40:24.300
YOU'RE SCARED.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.800
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A COWARD?

40:26.833 --> 40:29.500
(sighs) I THINK YOU'RE
VERY FRIGHTENED, DR. GREY.

40:29.533 --> 40:32.233
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A COWARD?

40:32.267 --> 40:34.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:40.200 --> 40:41.700
(bell tolls)
