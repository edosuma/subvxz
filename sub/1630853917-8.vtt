WEBVTT

00:22.105 --> 00:24.107
What is it?

00:24.983 --> 00:26.985
It's a polar bear.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.572
No, I meant where-- where'd you get it?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.448
Balbriggan Road.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.619
Best spot in Dublin for roadkill.
Isn't that what you always say?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.372
They drive like lunatics around there.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
You never come down here.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.919
You always say my animals
give you nightmares.

00:45.087 --> 00:49.758
Well, I was actually looking
to borrow a bit of money.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.095
Not much, just a few thousand.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.682
Well, I would say a few thousand
is not much for me,

00:57.891 --> 01:00.811
but for you it's a fortune, no?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.522
Yeah, it's just that...

01:09.778 --> 01:12.531
Yeah, I was going to say
we've had a lot of expenses,

01:12.531 --> 01:14.283
what with Blanaid and the new school and--

01:14.283 --> 01:16.493
When was the last time
you visited your mother?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.955
What? Just now. I just saw her upstairs.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.749
You came to ask for money,
not to see Minna.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.211
God knows what would become of her
if anything happened to me.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.215
Well, she'd be looked after.
-By you?

01:35.012 --> 01:36.388
Her mind is going.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.516
Every week I lose
a little bit more of her.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.645
And all she ever says is,
"When will JP come?"

01:43.729 --> 01:45.606
I have my own family now.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.482
You never forgave her, did you?

01:47.566 --> 01:50.360
Don't know what you're talking about.
-Come on.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.364
She dressed you in your sister's clothes.

01:54.865 --> 01:59.036
It can't be a happy memory.
Or maybe you liked it?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.582
So, are you gonna give me
the money or not?

02:04.374 --> 02:05.501
No.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.055
Fucking hell.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.267
Dad!

02:24.895 --> 02:26.438
Dad!

02:26.522 --> 02:28.941
Dad!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.445
Dad.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.437
I'm telling you, he's in the freezer.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.648
There's no way.
-You don't believe me?

04:32.648 --> 04:35.776
No, but Grace said
that George walked out on her.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.612
He couldn't cope with Minna's dementia.
-That's just what JP told her.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.113
Right, so how did he die?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.406
Isn't it obvious?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.911
F...
-No way.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.207
No. John Paul is not a killer.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.334
There's a time I would have said
the same about us.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.169
Yeah, but why would he
murder his own father?

04:54.253 --> 04:56.380
Why do you think? Money.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.590
George is dead. Minna inherits everything.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.634
Yeah, exactly. So, how would that have--

05:00.634 --> 05:03.637
Well, as long as everyone
thinks he's alive,

05:03.637 --> 05:07.015
JP can spend his money as he wants.
-Fu...

05:07.099 --> 05:09.643
Maybe it was an accident?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.019
If it was an accident,

05:11.103 --> 05:13.856
then why would he hold onto the body
for how many years?

05:13.856 --> 05:16.900
I mean, he keeps it in a drawer
in his freezer room.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.696
He goes to check on it every Friday night
after he drops off Minna's shopping.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.282
I mean, he's a sick bastard.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.993
Wait a minute.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.745
Then we have him, right?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.163
Have him how?

05:30.247 --> 05:32.833
Well, all we'd have to do now is
ring the Guards.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.711
One phone call,
and he's out of Grace's life forever.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.171
No.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.674
Well, he won't be out of Grace's life.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.176
Not as long as he's still breathing.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.095
Yeah, but he won't have control over her,
will he? Not if he's inside.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.139
What, and you think
the minute he's sent down,

05:47.139 --> 05:51.310
Grace is gonna be going to Connolly's
disco night for mature singles with you?

05:51.894 --> 05:52.895
No offense.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.354
None taken.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.857
She'll stand by him.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.903
There'll be a trial, then an appeal,
and it will go on and on and on,

06:00.903 --> 06:05.073
and even if he does get a sentence,
she'll wait for him.

06:05.157 --> 06:09.036
Or he'll say it was Minna who killed him.
I wouldn't put it past him.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.204
Jesus, he might even kill her

06:10.204 --> 06:12.414
when he realizes it's cheaper
than putting her in a home.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.624
Calm down, Becka.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.213
I was thinking I could lock him in there.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.257
What?
-Make it look like an accident.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.717
Let him freeze to death.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.512
Jesus, Becka.
-What?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.889
Well, it's just the way you said it.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.016
Well, we still want him dead, don't we?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.477
Yeah, but...
-Not like that.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.272
I mean, that's just--
Come on, that's a bit risky.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.316
Risky. Exactly.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.109
Come on! Give me a chance.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.819
It's not a clean kill, Becka.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.324
You with the cabin fire?
Her with the poisoned liver?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.409
I mean,
when has it ever been a clean kill?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.788
The paintballing? The marina?

06:52.788 --> 06:56.416
Yeah, exactly, which is why
we can't afford any more cock-ups.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.919
Look, I don't want you
to end up in prison.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.213
Answer's no.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.264
I rubbed it down with a wet cloth.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.141
You'd never even know
there was marmalade on it.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.352
Still no sign of Roger.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.773
You don't think it's true, do you?

07:19.857 --> 07:23.777
No smoke without a fire, Mammy.
You know that.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.571
Where is he, though?

07:25.571 --> 07:27.614
Why won't this thing tie?

07:28.407 --> 07:31.285
It's just nerves. It's only natural.

07:31.285 --> 07:35.539
I know quite a few people that would be
very upset if I got that job.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.417
Be nice to get it just to see their faces.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.919
Well, hope Eva isn't too disappointed.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.464
She worked really hard for that promotion.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.216
And what? I didn't?

07:47.509 --> 07:48.510
No.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.472
You want your sister to get the job.
I get it.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.017
Blood is thicker than water.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.562
And there's still marmalade
on this jacket.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.939
Have a nice day.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.026
Is Dad okay?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.405
Yeah. He just has a lot on his mind.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.116
Come on. I'll walk you to school.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.162
I hate how that woman makes tea.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.748
No, you just hate her.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.918
Yeah, but because of how she makes tea.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.255
My granny, when I was little,

08:25.339 --> 08:28.759
used to put a drop of whiskey in my tea
when I was feeling under the weather.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.344
It was delicious.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.136
Are you feeling under the weather?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.097
Just nerves.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.601
What are you nervous of?
-Rejection.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.602
Do you not remember?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.523
Hey, that's not the Eva Garvey I know.
-My God.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.358
Are you gonna give me a pep talk now?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.984
Why do you always do that?

08:46.652 --> 08:48.946
What do I do?
-Make a joke.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.949
Maybe I was about to say something,
I don't know, profound.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.617
Yeah.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.453
Go on then, Aristotle. Let's hear it.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.123
I admire you.
-Why would you say a thing like that?

09:00.666 --> 09:03.293
I-- To do what you did
when your mom and dad died.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.130
To raise a family...
I mean, you are a lioness, Eva.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.387
Well, you would have done the same.
-Me? No, I run away from everything.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.099
Look, I'm just saying
you deserve this job.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.143
So, go in there and act like it.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.228
Okay.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.278
And then we'll get some whiskey
for your tea.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.362
Yeah.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.322
Your granny has a lot to answer for.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.616
I know! She raised a lush.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.457
Sit down there, Eva.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.917
Well, I am sitting.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.837
Of course you are. No, I'm sorry.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.842
Look, at the outset,

09:51.842 --> 09:56.013
I just wanna say that I really,
really value the work that you do here.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.391
I didn't get it, did I?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.521
Do you mind if I ask why?

10:04.605 --> 10:07.900
Because I'm better qualified than him

10:07.900 --> 10:09.276
and you said I did a great interview.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.070
Well, sometimes these decisions
are based more on

10:12.154 --> 10:14.323
just who's the best-qualified candidate.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.241
Are they? I--
-Yeah.

10:16.325 --> 10:22.581
I just feel that JP is more, well,
temperamentally suited to the role.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.833
Temperamentally suited?

10:24.917 --> 10:26.543
This wasn't an easy decision, Eva.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.379
Right. So, I'm temperamentally unsuited.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.257
No, I'm just concerned
that you might not have the...

10:33.133 --> 10:40.015
Well, shall we say mental resources
to cope with the additional pressure

10:40.015 --> 10:43.143
in a way that's healthy.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.725
Roger.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.196
It's not true, Grace.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.202
I know it's-- You don't need to pretend.
I know everybody's been talking about it.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.955
Well, I don't listen to rumors, Roger.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.416
It was terrible.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.459
They were asking me
all sorts of questions.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.753
Love.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.548
"How come a man
of your age has never married?"

11:55.174 --> 11:58.969
And, "You seem to have
an unnatural interest in children."

11:58.969 --> 12:01.722
But that's ridiculous.
Just because you run a youth club

12:01.722 --> 12:03.307
does not automatically mean you're--
-I know.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.642
I've had text messages from parents,

12:05.726 --> 12:07.352
people who've known me for years,

12:07.436 --> 12:09.146
telling me to stay away
from their children.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.481
But I don't understand.
How did this happen?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.276
Well, somebody called the Guards.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.862
Somebody round here would be my guess.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.618
Six hours they held me for, Grace.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.369
If they hadn't have taken
my shoelaces off me,

12:24.453 --> 12:28.332
I'd have topped myself.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.709
Darling, don't cry on my account.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.630
I'm not. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm--

12:35.255 --> 12:36.548
What is it, Grace?

12:37.508 --> 12:39.176
Grace, what is it?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.805
It's John Paul.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.767
They found him unconscious
in the water at the marina.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.145
I nearly lost him.
-What?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.691
He tried to kill himself.
-JP?

12:56.068 --> 12:58.153
But why?
-I don't know.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.364
He won't say. He keeps shutting me out.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.117
Jesus, here's me going on
about my problems,

13:04.201 --> 13:06.912
and you've got this going on.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.622
I can't make him talk to me.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.127
He will in time.
And yous will both get through this.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.215
Look, I know he will.
He's got you, hasn't he?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.801
Roger.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.349
Don't cry, love.
-Sorry.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.645
Apparently,
I'm not emotionally equipped for the job.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.856
What, and JP is?
-Yeah, well, yeah.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.691
He seemed to think so.
-Come on!

13:35.691 --> 13:37.860
I fished him out of the marina
the other night

13:37.860 --> 13:39.403
with his balls hanging out.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.282
I'm sure he said something to him,
to poison his mind against me.

13:44.199 --> 13:47.578
Poisoned it how?
-Well, I wasn't well, was I?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.621
Had a spell in rehab.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.208
Right. God, I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.711
Not such a lioness after all.

13:55.711 --> 13:59.214
And you think he told him?
-Well, yeah!

13:59.298 --> 14:01.091
I mean, he was the only one who knew.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.051
Apart from my sisters,
they wouldn't have said anything.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.887
I mean, I wouldn't put it past the--

14:04.887 --> 14:07.347
Excuse me, ladies.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.028
What the fuck?

14:29.453 --> 14:34.166
There we go.
You're looking at your new boss.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.801
Prick.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.349
I knew that job inside out. It was mine.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.059
Gerald as good as said it.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.311
And you definitely think it was JP
who told him?

14:54.311 --> 14:55.729
About the breakdown?
-Yeah.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.899
I could hear it in his voice.
See it in his face.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.026
You know, the fear.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.861
Like he was gonna
have to phone an ambulance.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.696
Have the madwoman sectioned.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.823
Sorry.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.493
Ben, this isn't a good time.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.621
And when has it ever been?
I need to see you.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.414
<i>I can't. I'm at Bibi's.</i>

15:14.498 --> 15:17.459
And what if I told you I had
the answer to everything?

15:18.669 --> 15:21.797
Okay, tomorrow lunchtime. Where?

15:22.297 --> 15:23.423
I'll send you the location.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.009
Can you not just tell me?

15:30.264 --> 15:33.892
Honestly, I'd almost stab him
to death in the office at this stage.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.854
Take me chances with a jury.
-Eva.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.440
What? All you need is
one juror who's sympathetic.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.776
What about my plan?

15:42.860 --> 15:44.319
You were told no, Becka.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.574
No, let's hear it again.
-Okay.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.662
Well, I did some research.
And I bought a ham.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.873
A ham?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.083
Yeah.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.503
I was trying to figure out how long
it would take JP to freeze to death.

16:01.587 --> 16:04.965
Anyway, the ham weighed two kilos.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.508
And so, I put it in the freezer,

16:06.592 --> 16:09.178
and it was frozen solid
after about an hour.

16:09.178 --> 16:13.015
So, JP weighs, I'm guessing,
what, like 80 kilos?

16:14.224 --> 16:17.644
So, it would be 40 times how--
-Jesus Christ, Becka.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.396
It's not like the cartoons.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.648
What do you mean?

16:21.732 --> 16:25.986
I mean, you don't die the second your body
is frozen all the way through.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.365
He'd die from hypothermia first,
long before the body's actually frozen.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.118
Well, how long we talking?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.079
Two to three hours?
Depending on how cold the room is.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.332
That's a good point.
Is there temperature control?

16:38.332 --> 16:39.666
Yeah.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.256
I actually don't know.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.842
Let's go and check it out.

17:01.939 --> 17:05.483
<i>I want $20 a night for three weeks.
That's $300.</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:07.402
<i>I'll give you a hundred.</i>

17:19.122 --> 17:22.584
Got it. I got the job!

17:22.584 --> 17:25.045
I was so worried when you didn't call.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.256
Gerald took me out for a long lunch.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.551
Blanaid, Daddy got a new job.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.636
Will you get a pay rise?

17:32.636 --> 17:34.638
There'll be more money, all right.

17:34.638 --> 17:35.806
Yes.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.349
Can I get my teeth straightened?

17:37.349 --> 17:39.518
No, 'cause there's
nothing wrong with them.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.355
You have a smile
that would give Mona Lisa a complex.

17:44.565 --> 17:48.026
I'll get that.
-Okay.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.530
You, there's nothing wrong
with your teeth.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.116
It's your nose you need sorting out.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.246
What do you want?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.457
Listen, JP, I just wanted to say,

18:02.541 --> 18:04.418
Grace told me about your trouble.

18:04.418 --> 18:05.919
Did she now?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.588
Yeah. Is it a bad time?

18:08.589 --> 18:12.718
With everything I'm hearing about you,
Roger, I'd say anytime is a bad time.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.428
Well, that was a setup.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.138
So, where have you been all this time?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.348
I was questioned by the police.

18:18.432 --> 18:20.309
No, not for a week you weren't.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.769
Well, I went away for a few days.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.271
I've got a sister up in Bettystown.

18:24.271 --> 18:28.400
And she can vouch for that, can she?
That you were there the whole time?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.737
"Vouch for that," JP?
Why you asking me all these questions?

18:31.737 --> 18:35.324
It's like I said, it's probably better
that you stay away from here.

18:35.324 --> 18:38.285
I have a 12-year-old daughter
in the house.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.329
And it's my duty to protect her.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.884
Come on. Minna's asleep.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.636
And we definitely won't wake her?

18:55.636 --> 18:57.346
She'd sleep through an earthquake.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.141
Here.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.060
We might need these.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.731
Thermostat's on the outside.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.817
Yes! I knew it! I knew there was
a thermostat. Had a feeling.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.445
He keeps the key in here.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.161
I was thinking of hiding in there.

19:22.663 --> 19:27.751
JP walks past, goes inside, I jump out,
lock the door, turn the temperature up.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.211
Down.
-Down.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.839
Yeah. It goes to minus 32 degrees Celsius.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.757
What if he takes the key inside with him?

19:33.841 --> 19:35.676
I was gonna get a spare key cut.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.511
Yeah, but he'd still have a key in there.

19:38.011 --> 19:42.891
There's no lock on the inside,
so there's no way he can get out.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.310
Then what happens?
-I come back after a few hours,

19:45.394 --> 19:49.439
unlock the door, take the spare key,
turn the temperature back up.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.192
Grace reports him missing.
The Guards come.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.445
And find him curled up with his dead dad.

19:55.529 --> 19:58.031
Like a Swedish Norman Bates.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.449
Then what?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.953
Then they presume he fell asleep.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.414
I like it.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.134
Oh, my God.

20:17.134 --> 20:19.595
Jesus, my nips.
-It's very chilly.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.058
Urs, I don't think you want--
-Please.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.477
Do you know how many
dead bodies I've seen in my life?

20:30.814 --> 20:33.942
Jesus. Image of John Paul, isn't he?

20:35.319 --> 20:38.447
It's been a long time
since JP was that hard.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.080
So, what would happen?

20:47.164 --> 20:48.999
His body temperature
would fall very quickly.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.793
He'd have a burning sensation
like pins and needles all over his body.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.962
His heart rate, respiratory rate,

20:54.046 --> 20:56.006
blood pressure would drop.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.425
His body would slow the supply
of oxygen to his brain.

20:58.509 --> 21:02.012
He'd feel drowsy,
and he'd slip into unconsciousness.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.473
Then his heart would just...

21:04.473 --> 21:05.891
Stop.
-Yep.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.440
Have you got mobile coverage in here?

21:14.775 --> 21:16.652
I've no signal. No.
-No.

21:16.652 --> 21:17.903
Me neither.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.405
Do you think it's soundproof?

21:20.489 --> 21:23.325
Who's gonna hear him screaming?
-Well, Minna might.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.286
Are you deliberately trying
to find holes in the plan?

21:26.370 --> 21:30.541
Yeah! I am because that's what it means
when you recce a job.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.377
Recce? Profesh.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.753
What's the matter with you?

21:34.837 --> 21:36.338
This is exactly the kind of thing

21:36.338 --> 21:38.757
that's gonna land us in prison
for the rest of our lives.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.384
Okay, okay.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.636
You all go outside
and see if you can hear anything.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.847
Go.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.521
Help!

21:56.733 --> 22:02.489
Help! My mad bitch sisters-in-law
are trying to kill me!

22:11.164 --> 22:13.292
Shit. It's freezing. I'm coming out.

22:14.543 --> 22:18.547
It worked?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.632
Well, it's not soundproof.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.260
What are you talking about?

22:23.260 --> 22:24.678
I literally couldn't hear a thing.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.305
Well, tough shit because I could.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.807
What did you hear then, bat ears?

22:28.891 --> 22:31.727
It doesn't matter.
You're not doing it, Becka.

22:32.227 --> 22:35.105
Why? 'Cause you don't trust me?

22:36.690 --> 22:38.901
I can do this, Eva!
-No, you can't.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.362
Sorry, Becka. Mommy says no.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.515
Matt, where in the name of Jesus are you?
I said to you nine o'clock.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.519
Inspector Loftus coming through.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.066
What the hell are you doing here?

23:19.066 --> 23:21.193
Inspector, brought you a bit of breakfast.

23:21.193 --> 23:22.903
Heard you're partial to a rasher sandwich.

23:22.903 --> 23:25.197
Not when I'm digging up a corpse, I'm not.

23:25.948 --> 23:27.115
Bloody eejit.

23:27.199 --> 23:30.160
I just wanted to be here
in case there was any news.

23:30.244 --> 23:32.871
What, do you think
we're gonna crack open the lid

23:32.955 --> 23:34.831
and let you check the body
for bullet holes?

23:41.338 --> 23:43.340
Inspector, can you sign this, please?

23:49.388 --> 23:51.306
Thank you.
-When will you know something?

23:52.391 --> 23:53.976
We'll know when we know.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.812
And you'll know
when I decide you will know.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.147
Now, get out of here.

24:00.816 --> 24:01.817
Would you want the...

24:07.865 --> 24:08.866
Dickwad.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.910
What?
-Good luck. I just said good luck.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.770
Becka, I can see that you're in there.

24:51.158 --> 24:53.035
So, go on.

24:53.035 --> 24:54.745
You've had all night
to come up with an excuse.

24:54.745 --> 24:55.829
Where were you?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.582
I'm sorry. I just-- I was--
-Just what?

24:58.582 --> 25:01.543
What are you doing here, Matt?
What do you want?

25:03.170 --> 25:04.755
I want you.

25:06.590 --> 25:07.799
I want you.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.553
I've been sitting here since eight o'clock
last night waiting for you.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.435
Another time-waster.

25:30.989 --> 25:35.118
Look, this thing between us,

25:35.619 --> 25:37.621
whatever it is, it's real for me.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.753
It is for me too.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.292
What's that?

26:23.292 --> 26:24.376
Sorry.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.170
It's last night's tortilla chips.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.532
Matt?

26:56.617 --> 26:57.743
Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.162
Yeah, I'll get going in a second.

27:09.713 --> 27:10.714
I'm sorry.

27:12.216 --> 27:13.425
I'm sorry.

27:14.343 --> 27:16.470
I don't know why it's...

27:28.106 --> 27:29.399
I'm sorry.
-No.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.611
It's not like we have to have sex
every time we hang out.

27:33.153 --> 27:36.031
I'm gonna get a glass of water.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.326
You want one?

28:43.599 --> 28:44.808
Shall I hit the road, or?

28:47.019 --> 28:48.020
I don't mind.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.980
What, you want me to go?

28:49.980 --> 28:52.399
No, I'm not saying I want you to go.
I'm just saying I don't mind if you do.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.279
Okay.

29:30.437 --> 29:33.065
Is everything okay?

29:34.650 --> 29:36.693
Yeah, everything's fine.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.156
Yeah, I'll call you.

30:02.678 --> 30:04.304
Shit.

30:06.849 --> 30:08.225
Shit.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.898
Shit.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.401
<i>They dug him up?</i>

30:17.401 --> 30:20.821
Jesus Christ.
I'm not gonna see the kids grow up.

30:20.821 --> 30:22.990
Just don't go losing it, okay?

30:22.990 --> 30:25.033
They wouldn't have dug up the body
if they weren't on to us.

30:25.117 --> 30:26.410
No, they're gonna start
pulling at threads.

30:26.410 --> 30:28.579
And they're not gonna stop
until they find out what we've done.

30:28.579 --> 30:31.999
I can't believe that you can just dig up
a body without telling the family.

30:32.791 --> 30:33.834
Should we tell Grace?

30:33.834 --> 30:36.086
Absolutely not. No way.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.462
Okay, I just want you to know now

30:37.546 --> 30:39.256
that I'd rather kill myself
than go to prison.

30:39.256 --> 30:41.341
Will you just calm down?

30:41.967 --> 30:43.010
You're a nurse.

30:43.010 --> 30:45.596
You're supposed to be good under pressure.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.641
How did you know, by the way?

30:52.102 --> 30:53.729
What do you mean?

30:53.729 --> 30:56.607
Well, just how did you know
that they dug up the body?

31:01.528 --> 31:03.488
Is someone gonna tell me what's going on?

31:05.574 --> 31:07.159
Becka, if you don't, I will.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.872
I've been seeing Matt Claffin.

31:13.624 --> 31:15.959
What? You've been--
You've been seeing him as in you--

31:16.043 --> 31:17.419
you've been sleeping with him?

31:17.503 --> 31:19.630
I have slept with him. Yes.

31:22.341 --> 31:25.093
What the hell are you thinking, Becka?

31:25.177 --> 31:27.262
See, I knew this is how you'd react.

31:27.346 --> 31:28.847
What the fuck, Bibi?

31:28.931 --> 31:30.724
I-- She said she was gonna end it.

31:31.683 --> 31:33.727
I haven't told him anything
if that's what you're worried about.

31:33.727 --> 31:35.812
I mean, we don't even talk about the case.

31:35.896 --> 31:37.564
No, I'm sure he doesn't.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.233
Yeah, I bet he didn't tell you
he was digging up

31:39.233 --> 31:42.027
your brother-in-law's body
this morning, did he?

31:42.027 --> 31:45.989
I mean, why him, Becka? Of all people.

31:46.073 --> 31:48.325
I mean, did you sleep with
every other man this side of the city?

31:48.325 --> 31:49.576
Now, now, Eva. Come on.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.079
Who are you to tell me
who I can and can't sleep with?

31:52.079 --> 31:54.957
I'm the one who's trying
to look out for you, okay?

31:54.957 --> 31:57.251
Like I always have.
-Yeah.

31:57.251 --> 31:59.545
Spare me the martyr act.

32:00.337 --> 32:03.966
I'm sick to the teeth of hearing
how poor Eva Garvey

32:03.966 --> 32:06.134
gave up everything
to raise her little sisters.

32:06.218 --> 32:07.219
Come on, stop.

32:07.219 --> 32:09.555
Yeah, it was that
or have you put into care. Okay?

32:11.974 --> 32:13.392
Don't lay your guilt on me.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.229
Only reason you've got
your nose in my life is

32:17.229 --> 32:19.398
'cause you've got no life of your own.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.150
You do not--
-Oh, my God.

32:22.234 --> 32:24.027
No!
-No.

32:24.111 --> 32:25.362
Get off me!
-Stop it!

32:25.362 --> 32:28.907
Okay. Jesus, just get out of my house.

32:28.991 --> 32:30.534
Okay? All of you.

32:31.994 --> 32:35.414
You can rot in prison for all I care.

33:01.940 --> 33:05.986
So, I read this thing that if you dangle
a chain over the belly of a pregnant lady,

33:06.486 --> 33:08.822
you can accurately predict
the sex of the baby.

33:09.323 --> 33:10.282
That's bullshit.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.117
If it moves
in a clockwise direction it's a boy.

33:12.201 --> 33:14.953
If it moves anti-clockwise--
-Well, we said we didn't wanna know.

33:15.037 --> 33:17.164
I thought you said it was bullshit.

33:29.718 --> 33:33.514
Off-- It's a boy!

33:33.514 --> 33:35.766
I can see you moving your wrist.
-What?

33:39.353 --> 33:40.479
You're in good form.

33:40.479 --> 33:43.941
They dug him up.

33:44.942 --> 33:45.943
This morning.

33:46.652 --> 33:49.029
And that's what it takes
to put a smile on your face, is it?

33:50.864 --> 33:52.991
They killed him, Theresa. I know it.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.285
Does Matt?

33:56.411 --> 33:57.871
Know it, I mean.

33:58.872 --> 34:01.124
Matt's never been
the best judge of people.

34:03.252 --> 34:05.671
He's in love with her, Tom.
-No, he's not.

34:06.171 --> 34:08.340
He's thinking with his dick. That's all.

34:09.716 --> 34:12.969
I can see it. Even if you can't.

34:13.053 --> 34:15.848
Tom, are you here?

34:22.646 --> 34:27.317
You have to know when push comes
to shove if you can rely on him or not.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.248
Where were you this morning?

34:42.123 --> 34:44.626
Told you I'm not hanging around
some grave like a ghoul.

34:46.837 --> 34:49.882
I just wanted to make sure
they dug up the right body, is all.

34:51.967 --> 34:53.302
So, where were you?

34:53.927 --> 34:55.721
In answer to me question, like?
-Jesus.

34:56.221 --> 34:57.973
A copper wouldn't ask me that.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.393
Were you with her?

35:02.853 --> 35:04.980
Her name's Becka.
-I know her name.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.523
I know all their bleeding names.

35:07.191 --> 35:08.525
Yeah, I was with her.

35:09.026 --> 35:10.611
After me telling you
to stay away from her?

35:10.611 --> 35:12.905
After you telling me?

35:12.905 --> 35:14.448
Do you wanna wind your neck in?

35:14.448 --> 35:16.158
All right, I suggested it then.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.453
If you weren't actually
getting information from her--

35:19.453 --> 35:22.122
Yeah, and I chose to not take
your suggestion on board. So...

35:23.540 --> 35:26.043
You're out of your depth, Matt.
-Thomas, would you relax, okay?

35:26.043 --> 35:28.837
I have everything under control.
All right?

35:28.921 --> 35:30.589
And she knows, by the way.
-Knows what?

35:30.589 --> 35:32.966
That you dug up her brother-in-law's body.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.676
That we dug up her brother-in-law's body?

35:34.760 --> 35:36.094
Yeah. We then.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.013
How?

35:38.013 --> 35:40.933
Because you decided
to tell me it in a text.

35:40.933 --> 35:42.976
She read it when I was in the kitchen.

35:43.060 --> 35:46.063
She was gonna find out
sooner or later, Matt.

35:46.063 --> 35:49.900
Soon as the cops know how the man died,
they'll be kicking down her door.

35:50.651 --> 35:53.111
They'll be kicking down all their doors.

36:15.676 --> 36:19.137
Eva, do you have the pre-tender estimate
for the Robertson project?

36:19.805 --> 36:21.306
The--

36:21.849 --> 36:23.058
The Robertson project.

36:23.058 --> 36:25.477
You were asked for it yesterday,
but if it's too much for you,

36:25.561 --> 36:27.646
I can ask Janis.
-It's not too much.

36:29.106 --> 36:32.818
If you are struggling to cope,
I want you to be able to say it to me.

36:33.485 --> 36:34.987
I said I'd do it.
-Good.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.155
Want it by 3:00.

36:39.741 --> 36:42.911
And Eva, watch how you speak to me.

36:42.995 --> 36:45.539
I can understand you're disappointed,
but I'm your boss now,

36:45.539 --> 36:46.957
whether you like it or not.

36:46.957 --> 36:50.669
And while we're here in the office,
you will show me respect.

37:17.529 --> 37:21.491
Hey. Is it really necessary
to rub her nose in it like that?

37:21.575 --> 37:23.285
Do you mind?

37:26.205 --> 37:27.789
Eva deserved that job.

37:28.373 --> 37:31.877
You must have said something
very bad to Gerald to change his mind.

37:33.587 --> 37:35.881
You fighting her battles
for her now, are you?

37:35.881 --> 37:37.716
That's sweet.

37:37.716 --> 37:40.928
Your great mate. Except, she isn't.

37:41.470 --> 37:42.596
Yeah?
-I mean,

37:42.596 --> 37:47.518
she wouldn't have told me your deepest,
darkest secret if she was, would she?

37:48.268 --> 37:50.562
About you being a homosexual.

37:52.022 --> 37:53.857
Is it still all right to use that phrase?

37:54.900 --> 37:58.403
See, the thing here is
that you haven't known Eva that long.

37:58.487 --> 38:01.615
Her jaw gets very loose when she drinks.

38:01.615 --> 38:03.325
She told you?
-Told me,

38:03.825 --> 38:05.452
told her sisters, yeah.

38:05.536 --> 38:09.581
I'm sure the entire office knows by now,
what you are.

38:10.249 --> 38:12.125
I'd say you thrashed the water to a foam

38:12.626 --> 38:14.503
to be the one to give me
mouth-to-mouth, didn't you?

38:14.503 --> 38:16.129
I should have let you drown.

38:16.713 --> 38:20.092
Was it you who took my pants off?
Did you get a good look at it?

38:20.676 --> 38:23.720
Hey. I could have you up in front of HR--

38:23.804 --> 38:27.182
Hey, mate.
You're the one who followed me in here.

38:27.683 --> 38:30.769
I could say that you tried it on with me.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.689
Because I've seen the way you look at me.

38:34.606 --> 38:35.941
Don't do that.

38:49.830 --> 38:50.956
Hey.

38:55.335 --> 38:56.503
Gabriel.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.387
All right there, Gabe? Is everything...

39:09.474 --> 39:10.475
Gabriel.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.734
Gabriel!

39:19.610 --> 39:22.154
I can't believe you told him.
Of all people.

39:22.154 --> 39:23.197
Told him what?

39:26.074 --> 39:27.826
Jesus. I didn't. I--

39:27.910 --> 39:29.536
So how does he know?

39:29.620 --> 39:31.622
You're the only one in the office I told.

39:33.457 --> 39:35.417
Shit. Grace must have said something.

39:35.501 --> 39:37.252
Yeah, he said
you told your sisters as well.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.213
Yeah, but only because they kept asking

39:39.213 --> 39:42.216
if something was going on
between us. That's all.

39:42.216 --> 39:44.468
So my private life is what? Gossip to you?

39:44.468 --> 39:46.762
Gabriel, please, just--
This is what he does. Okay?

39:46.762 --> 39:49.348
He just gets inside people's heads,
and he messes with them.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.141
So what's going on between you two?

39:51.225 --> 39:54.269
Who? Me and JP?
-Yeah.

39:54.353 --> 39:56.855
You going to pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about?

39:58.398 --> 40:00.234
You say you hate him,
but sometimes it seems to me

40:00.234 --> 40:02.319
like there's something else.

40:03.779 --> 40:05.155
Gabriel.

40:05.989 --> 40:08.742
Whatever game you two are playing,
I want no part of it.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.003
How are you?

40:20.879 --> 40:23.090
Sorry.
Didn't mean to put the shits up you.

40:23.757 --> 40:25.133
What do you want?
-I just--

40:26.552 --> 40:28.220
It's been two days.
-So?

40:28.220 --> 40:29.888
So what was the result?

40:29.972 --> 40:33.559
It's a postmortem, Mr. Claffin,
not a bloody horse race.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.353
Well, then I was thinking,
the longer it goes on,

40:37.062 --> 40:39.273
the more likely it is
they've found something iffy.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.441
Am I right?

40:41.525 --> 40:43.986
I've concluded my work
and sent my report to the police.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.529
Well, so did you find anything?

40:46.154 --> 40:48.657
I'm not at liberty
to discuss my findings with you.

40:48.657 --> 40:49.950
Could you not even give me a steer?

40:50.951 --> 40:53.871
A steer you want, is it?
Well, why didn't you say?

40:53.871 --> 40:56.915
There's a steer for you. Now jog on!

41:00.043 --> 41:01.670
My bloody business on the line.

41:06.258 --> 41:08.468
You've a terrible personality.

41:09.136 --> 41:10.554
You said what?

41:11.430 --> 41:12.681
I let him have it.

41:13.599 --> 41:14.600
Both barrels.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.519
You're gonna get yourself arrested, Tom.

41:17.603 --> 41:21.648
We're being dicked around, Matt.
Dicked around royally.

41:21.732 --> 41:24.276
And what in Jesus' name am I eating,
by the way?

41:25.027 --> 41:26.236
Breakfast roll.

41:26.320 --> 41:30.407
Sausage, bacon, egg,
black and white pudding in a baguette.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.451
I can feel the fur in me arteries already.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.745
You know what they call this
in the sandwich shop?

41:34.745 --> 41:37.039
What?
-The Widowmaker.

41:37.039 --> 41:40.000
Jesus.

41:45.839 --> 41:47.174
It's Loftus.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.176
Answer the thing.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.303
Inspector Loftus.

41:52.387 --> 41:53.722
Yeah, I'm after been waiting all--

41:53.722 --> 41:55.182
So, what's the story?

41:57.059 --> 41:58.894
Now, could you gimme that
in layman's terms?

42:00.979 --> 42:03.190
So what does it mean?

42:03.190 --> 42:05.817
Hello?

42:05.901 --> 42:07.194
What'd he say?

42:07.194 --> 42:09.738
Tom, what did he say?

42:10.364 --> 42:12.950
The results are inconclusive.
-Inconclusive as in...

42:12.950 --> 42:14.451
Jesus, as in inconclusive.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.495
As in nothing suspicious to report.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.665
So, what?
We had a man's body dug up for no reason?

42:19.665 --> 42:21.375
No, not no reason, Matt. They killed him.

42:21.375 --> 42:23.210
Just in a way that didn't leave a mark.

42:26.922 --> 42:28.674
Tom, you're gonna have to let this go now.

42:28.674 --> 42:29.883
Well, that's easy for you to say.

42:29.967 --> 42:31.969
You don't have to go home
and tell your massively pregnant wife

42:31.969 --> 42:33.595
you're going to jail.
-Look, I'm sorry.

42:33.679 --> 42:36.723
They did it, Matt. I know it. You know it.

42:36.807 --> 42:39.017
It's just, we're never gonna know how.

42:59.454 --> 43:01.039
<i>Back inside the prison,</i>

43:01.623 --> 43:07.254
<i>Fred is subjected to merciless torture
led by Gestapo head Walter Guettner.</i>

43:08.046 --> 43:09.506
<i>He was a little rat.</i>

43:10.424 --> 43:13.719
<i>And I could have killed him
with one hand if I was free.</i>

43:27.149 --> 43:28.400
What am I doing here?

43:28.400 --> 43:30.611
So, what do you think?
-Of what?

43:31.236 --> 43:32.321
That house.

43:32.905 --> 43:36.617
I mean,
I know it's the same as that house.

43:37.367 --> 43:38.785
But this one is available for rent,

43:38.869 --> 43:41.413
and I can afford it
if I give up my studio.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.207
You love your studio.

43:43.207 --> 43:45.667
I don't love it as much
as I wanna be with you.

43:45.751 --> 43:49.004
And there's a room for Molly and David,
and Michael as well.

43:49.004 --> 43:52.341
I wanna be whatever you need me to be--

43:52.341 --> 43:54.259
Ben.
-No. This can work for us, Urs.

43:54.343 --> 43:56.470
I really think it can. If you could just--

43:56.470 --> 43:58.555
Ben, I can't see you anymore.

43:58.639 --> 44:01.099
What are you talking about?
-Please don't ask me to explain.

44:01.183 --> 44:02.184
Of course,

44:02.184 --> 44:04.436
I'm going to ask you to explain.
-Please. Please.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.855
No. I deserve to know, don't you think?

44:06.939 --> 44:08.607
John Paul...
-What about him?

44:08.607 --> 44:11.443
He has a photograph of me.
-Of you?

44:12.194 --> 44:14.530
Of my...

44:17.199 --> 44:18.116
How?

44:18.742 --> 44:21.036
You didn't--
-No, of course, I didn't.

44:21.912 --> 44:23.372
He got into my phone.

44:23.372 --> 44:26.375
He switched his number for yours,
and he told me to take a picture.

44:26.375 --> 44:30.295
I thought I was sending it to you.
He sent it to Donal.

44:30.379 --> 44:31.713
He what?
-It's okay,

44:31.797 --> 44:33.257
I deleted it before Donal saw it,

44:33.257 --> 44:35.175
but he'll do it again
if I keep on seeing you.

44:35.259 --> 44:37.803
And I don't know
what will happen if Donal sees that.

44:37.803 --> 44:40.931
He could get nasty,
and I might lose the kids.

44:40.931 --> 44:43.433
I'm gonna kill him.
-You're only gonna make things worse.

44:43.517 --> 44:45.561
I wouldn't have said anything--
-No. I'm gonna fucking kill him.

44:45.561 --> 44:48.146
Ben, stop. Please. Ben.

44:48.230 --> 44:52.109
Ben. Come here.

44:54.653 --> 44:55.904
<i>No lark</i>

44:55.988 --> 44:59.867
<i>When Dublin city is in the dark</i>

44:59.867 --> 45:03.537
<i>So if you've any money
Go up to the park</i>

45:03.537 --> 45:07.374
<i>And view the zoological gardens</i>

45:07.374 --> 45:11.378
<i>We went out there to see the old zoo</i>

45:11.378 --> 45:12.462
I'll get it.

45:12.546 --> 45:15.632
<i>We saw the lion and the kangaroo</i>

45:15.716 --> 45:19.469
<i>There was he-males
And she-males of every hue</i>

45:19.970 --> 45:20.971
Hi.

45:20.971 --> 45:23.974
<i>Up in the zoological gardens</i>

45:24.558 --> 45:25.559
Hiya, Becka.

45:25.559 --> 45:27.019
Hi.
-Hiya.

45:27.895 --> 45:31.565
Can we talk?
-Sure.

45:32.524 --> 45:34.401
I wanna do it. Tonight.
-Becka.

45:34.401 --> 45:37.154
When he drops the shopping off
and goes to check on the body.

45:38.864 --> 45:40.199
Eva said no, Becka.

45:40.866 --> 45:44.828
That room was completely soundproof.
We couldn't hear a word outta you.

45:45.495 --> 45:47.456
I'm sick of her treating me like a baby.

45:47.456 --> 45:52.169
You know where she's coming from.
You're the daughter she never had.

45:52.169 --> 45:54.922
Well, she's the mother I never wanted.
Okay?

45:57.424 --> 45:59.301
She just doesn't want you
to have blood on your hands.

45:59.301 --> 46:01.595
Bibi, I have to do this.

46:02.513 --> 46:03.639
If JP would kill his dad,

46:03.639 --> 46:05.265
he wouldn't think twice
about killing Minna.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.101
That's Urs.

46:08.685 --> 46:10.854
I told her to meet us here.
-You did what?

46:22.491 --> 46:24.117
Seriously, Urs?

46:24.201 --> 46:26.328
We don't have to tell Eva.

46:26.328 --> 46:28.372
Not until it's done.

46:34.294 --> 46:36.088
I suppose I should wish you luck.

46:40.342 --> 46:42.761
I don't need luck.

47:06.618 --> 47:09.329
Cleaned it off, have you?

47:22.342 --> 47:24.595
Evening, all.
-Hey, love.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.638
You're just in time.

47:26.722 --> 47:28.932
I'm cooking your favorite.

47:30.017 --> 47:32.978
Oh, my God. Daddy, your eye.
-Jesus, JP.

47:32.978 --> 47:35.063
You should've seen the other guy.

47:35.147 --> 47:36.106
Who?

47:36.190 --> 47:39.318
Your sister's mate,
or what's-- what is he to her?

47:39.318 --> 47:40.736
Gabriel?

47:40.736 --> 47:42.696
Why would he do that? He saved your life.

47:42.696 --> 47:44.281
Did something set him off?

47:44.281 --> 47:46.783
You know what the French are like.
Furious about everything.

47:46.867 --> 47:49.995
Turning lorries upside down,
setting fire to fish.

47:49.995 --> 47:51.830
What?
-Did you call the police?

47:51.914 --> 47:54.791
No. Gerald gave him his marching orders.

47:54.875 --> 47:58.420
Never had much taste in men,
that sister of yours, did she?

47:59.004 --> 48:01.507
Your poor eye.
-It's all right, Mammy.

48:02.007 --> 48:04.092
Listen, I'll just go do the shopping
for my mum.

48:04.176 --> 48:06.011
I just need to get changed.
-Okay.

48:12.059 --> 48:13.727
It's nice to see you so...

48:14.311 --> 48:16.480
So?
-I don't know.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.065
Full of yourself again.

48:18.065 --> 48:20.234
I know I haven't been at my best lately,

48:20.234 --> 48:23.820
but I promise it's only happy times
ahead for us now.

48:34.790 --> 48:37.751
You make me feel young again.

48:37.835 --> 48:39.086
My pleasure.

48:39.586 --> 48:42.714
A few more sessions
and you'll have the hip of a--

48:42.798 --> 48:45.259
Well, of a me, actually.

48:45.259 --> 48:47.886
Be a lovely thing to be your hip's age.

48:48.428 --> 48:50.848
All of me, though. Not just a hip.

48:50.848 --> 48:52.891
What would you do differently?

48:52.975 --> 48:54.393
If you were my age?

48:55.227 --> 48:58.856
More sex. For starters.

48:58.856 --> 49:01.400
And I'd get my nose pierced.

49:02.150 --> 49:05.070
That's easy.
I'll pierce your nose for you.

49:05.070 --> 49:08.740
No. John Paul would go mad.

49:09.533 --> 49:10.993
That's another reason to do it.

49:12.327 --> 49:13.954
Okay, you're gonna feel a little prick.

49:13.954 --> 49:15.622
A little p--
-Don't say it.

49:17.082 --> 49:18.083
You ready?

49:19.751 --> 49:24.339
One. Two. Three.
-Fi-- Fu--

49:25.924 --> 49:26.967
Sorry.

49:31.555 --> 49:33.307
Okay. Put that on your nose.

49:36.852 --> 49:40.105
So what time does JP come here?

49:40.772 --> 49:42.858
Sometime after 9:00.

49:42.858 --> 49:45.569
Although I don't think
I can stay awake tonight.

49:46.195 --> 49:49.698
That massage has made me sleepy.

49:53.493 --> 49:54.828
Give me that.

50:05.547 --> 50:06.882
Okay.

50:08.050 --> 50:10.636
That actually looks really good.

50:12.429 --> 50:13.722
There you go.

50:17.809 --> 50:20.354
Do you think George will like it?

50:22.272 --> 50:23.899
I do.
-Yeah.

51:01.728 --> 51:07.693
Jesus Christ. What is this madman doing?

51:10.487 --> 51:13.699
Look, it's the lover.
What can I do for you?

51:18.996 --> 51:20.956
Anyone sees that photograph,

51:22.165 --> 51:25.252
I'll kill you and not give a shit
about going to prison.

51:25.252 --> 51:28.130
Please let go.

53:48.312 --> 53:50.439
It's done, Eva.

53:51.815 --> 53:53.025
What's done?

53:53.025 --> 53:55.777
The prick is dead.
