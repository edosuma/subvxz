00:13.095 --> 00:14.211
Chiropractic school?

00:14.213 --> 00:15.379
Long before that.

00:15.381 --> 00:17.515
When I was a kid,
I had to do this for my mom.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.433
Had to?

00:19.435 --> 00:21.352
If I wanted dessert.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.487

in a leotard and a skirt

00:41.541 --> 00:43.874
realizes he chopped
his own brother's head off.

00:44.743 --> 00:46.427

00:57.356 --> 00:59.390
To appreciate it requires
a refined taste

01:15.458 --> 01:17.107
What's that supposed to mean?

01:17.109 --> 01:19.243
Uh, pejorative is having
a derogatory...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.212

the word means!
