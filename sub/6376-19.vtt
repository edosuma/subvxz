00:01.034 --> 00:02.524
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.569 --> 00:03.627
That's Lindsay Dunne!

00:03.670 --> 00:05.934
<i>He's the most powerful publisher
in all of Britain.</i>

00:08.308 --> 00:09.332
Please don't tell anyone.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.673
All right, it's just between us.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.734
It's not the right time.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.713
Well, we'll still see each other.
Long-distance.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.613
I guess
I was destined to be an alcoholic.

00:16.649 --> 00:18.640
Consider Willie your sponsor.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.119
I think Claire might have lied to me
about who my father is.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.116
Henry, what we had was amazing,
and...

00:25.158 --> 00:27.319
I'm always gonna be
a little bit in love with you.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.126
That's okay, as long as
it doesn't keep us from moving on.

00:38.938 --> 00:41.304
How can you drink
this stuff? It tastes like bad breath.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.639
Oh, no, I don't drink that.
But I hear it's good for you.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.440
You know, you don't have to fill in
for Amanda. I can get a temp, really.

00:46.479 --> 00:49.073
It's fine.
I can totally do my own work here.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.209
And it's kind of fun being back
at my old desk.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.049
Speaking of what a great friend I am...

00:54.087 --> 00:55.349
- Were we?
- We are now.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.552
I was wondering if you'd want to come
with me to Hilda's wedding.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.490
Are you asking me to be your date?

01:03.530 --> 01:06.294
I mean, if you're free. It's on Saturday.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.358
Never mind, you probably
have something better to do.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.199
No, it sounds like fun.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.172
I was supposed to see Trista
on Saturday, but...

01:14.207 --> 01:17.734
What? What's with the face?
Why are you so down on her?

01:17.777 --> 01:22.714
I'm sorry. She seems very sweet.
It's just she sort of makes you dumb.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.912
What? Wait, I don't see that at all.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.115
You know what?

01:28.154 --> 01:31.351
It's none of my business.
I will stay out of it.

01:32.592 --> 01:36.050
Why does Amanda have
a picture of me sleeping in here?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.361
That's not weird, right?
I mean, we lived together for a year.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.367
You don't have braces.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.062
Oh, my God, this is recent.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.401
You know,
I am gonna miss having her around.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.534
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.744
- Hello.
- Good.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.778
You don't work here anymore,
remember?

01:58.818 --> 02:00.615
You had that big dramatic exit

02:00.653 --> 02:03.451
where you tried to tip over
the reception desk and shouted out,

02:03.490 --> 02:07.586
"I'm a stylist now, circus freaks!
Take one last look at my tight behind!"

02:07.627 --> 02:09.219
Yeah, but I needed some pencils.

02:09.262 --> 02:12.754
Plus, how can I set up shop
without my Sleeping Betty?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.858
That's nice. Is this new?

02:14.901 --> 02:17.233
No, I'm just working
with a faster shutter speed.

02:17.270 --> 02:20.728
I got my first stylist referral.
Spencer Cannon.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.367
He's one of those soap opera actors
who's been on it 20 years.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.970
He plays twins.
An evil doctor and a really evil doctor.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.106
I'm gonna take him to the Closet
so we can get ideas.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.980
- You mean steal clothes?
- Yeah.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.848
Hey, Marc.
- Hey, Troy.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.481
Wow, nice jeans.
They really make your package pop.

02:37.056 --> 02:38.148
Oh.

02:38.525 --> 02:39.787
Thanks.

02:42.695 --> 02:43.787
Marc, stop it.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.560
You have small shoulders,
you can't be desperate, too.

02:46.599 --> 02:50.296
How could he leave me
for that poindexter? I loved Troy.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.237
- Really?
- Yeah. In my own standoffish way.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.969
- Hey, your ward's here.
- Oh.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.269
Hey, what's up, junior?

03:01.581 --> 03:04.641
Can I talk to you? It's really important.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.481
Okay. Come on.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.163 --> 03:21.259
So, that really important thing
you had to talk to me about,

03:21.301 --> 03:25.032
did it involve words?
Do you want to do this later?

03:25.071 --> 03:26.265
Can you please just give me a second?

03:26.306 --> 03:29.798
Yes, of course. Of course.
I'm sorry. Take your time.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.635
Bobby's gonna say something
and everyone's gonna find out.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.741
- I'm not sure I know what you...
- He walked in on me and Austin.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.581
He saw us kissing.

03:43.823 --> 03:48.226
So, is Austin your boyfriend?

03:48.261 --> 03:50.024
I don't know.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.965
Maybe.
But why does anyone have to know?

03:56.202 --> 03:58.193
Um, okay.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.174
First of all, you have a boyfriend.
Yay for you.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.074
I don't.

04:05.612 --> 04:09.378
But also,
if you don't want anyone to know,

04:10.817 --> 04:12.876
they don't have to know.

04:13.219 --> 04:17.882
Bobby's a really great guy,
he's not gonna say anything.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.452
And as far as your mom goes?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.096
She's pretty cool.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.758
Well, what happened
when you told your mom?

04:27.567 --> 04:32.504
Well, my experience
was not necessarily the norm.

04:32.538 --> 04:33.835
It was bad, right?

04:33.873 --> 04:37.070
Your family is completely different.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.702
I don't want them to know.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.806
Okay, breathe. You don't have
to say a word until you're ready.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.046
<i>So, stop by
the art department and I'll have...</i>

04:49.088 --> 04:50.282
Delete. Pause.

04:50.323 --> 04:53.087
Okay, here are the earrings that
I promised Hilda for her wedding.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.220
And here are the diet pills.
I want her skinny as a beautiful corpse

04:56.262 --> 04:57.923
<i>when your papi helps her
down the aisle.</i>

04:57.964 --> 05:00.455
Thank you.
And since you've been so helpful,

05:00.500 --> 05:03.731
Hilda says you should bring a plus one.
Some of our family can't come.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.533
They got deported?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.670
<i>Hey, Betty. It's me.</i>

05:08.708 --> 05:09.766
Henry?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.835
<i>I got your message about coming
to Hilda's wedding on Saturday.</i>

05:12.879 --> 05:14.870
<i>- What?
- Your timing couldn't be better.</i>

05:14.914 --> 05:16.040
<i>I'll be in New York anyway.</i>

05:16.082 --> 05:17.549
<i>We're actually about
to get on the plane.</i>

05:17.583 --> 05:19.642
- It sounds like he put on a few pounds.
- Shh.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.883
<i>So, yeah. I'd love to be your date.</i>

05:22.922 --> 05:26.585
<i>- Okay, I'll see you when I get in. Bye.
- What? How is that possible?</i>

05:26.626 --> 05:29.288
- I never invited him.
- Yeah, you did.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.855
Sorry. That was a hiccup, not a burp.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.130
Hilda's getting married,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.729
and I was wondering
if you'd like to come to the wedding.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.136
As my date.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.363
Oh, my God.

05:43.009 --> 05:47.036
Oh, my God, I did!
I remember now.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.274
Why would I do that?

05:48.314 --> 05:50.339
Who knows why you do anything,
lady?

05:50.383 --> 05:53.648
That's why we love you just as you are,
brown and complicated.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.583
My first client's here.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.682
Kiss for good luck?
You're so withholding.

06:04.964 --> 06:08.400
Good news.
Your mother loves the crochet kit I sent.

06:08.434 --> 06:11.301
She's making me a sweater,
it'll be perfect for the fall.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.736
Thanks.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.537
<i>I'm going to Mode today.</i>

06:15.575 --> 06:18.806
I'm gonna tell Claire Meade that
I want my shares of that company.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.246
When I think of the poverty
you grew up in, it just...

06:22.281 --> 06:23.805
It breaks my heart.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.512
But, Tyler, can... Can I say something?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.645
Yeah. Anything.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.156
Wilhelmina,
you're the only person I trust anymore.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.891
Well, Tyler,
that means the world to me.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.324
It's just that

06:39.866 --> 06:43.097
being around the Meades
cost you your sobriety.

06:43.136 --> 06:47.539
And with the shares,
you will be tied to them indefinitely.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.168
- Well, can't I sell them?
- Well, I assume so.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.701
But in this climate,
it's gonna be hard to find a buyer.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.543
Well, I don't want that!

06:55.581 --> 06:59.677
I just want to get my money
and go home.

06:59.719 --> 07:04.122
Okay, okay, well, let's think about this.
There's always a solution.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.759
I suppose I could buy your shares.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.731
I mean, I'm used to dealing
with the Meades.

07:12.765 --> 07:13.925
You'd do that?

07:13.966 --> 07:17.561
Why not? A few more shares
doesn't mean a thing to me.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.876
And I want a commitment
not to drink today.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.975
- I won't.
- Good.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.310
I'm taking temptation away.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.997
So, you drunk-dialed Henry?
Why would you do that?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.595
I don't know.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.765
Well, it must mean something
if you drunk-dialed him.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.140
Well, come on,
I mean, you've drunk-dialed me before.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.203
"Betty, I'm locked out. "
"Betty, I can't find my phone. "

08:01.247 --> 08:02.942
"Betty, is my hair thinning?"

08:02.982 --> 08:05.780
Okay, that never happened,
because my hair is not getting thin.

08:05.818 --> 08:10.983
Anyway, the problem now
is that Henry is on a plane

08:11.023 --> 08:14.720
and he thinks that he's coming
to Hilda's wedding with me.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.894
Are you uninviting me?
Because I canceled plans.

08:19.932 --> 08:24.835
No, no, no. Hilda wants you to be there.
You could bring Trista.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.830
- I thought Trista made me dumb?
- But you like that.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.706
Come on, Daniel,
why are you being like this?

08:30.743 --> 08:32.677
I'm not being anything.
It's fine. I'll bring Trista.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.974
I'll just make sure and powder my head.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.674
I wouldn't want the pictures
to blind anyone.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.206
Thank you.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.250
Okay, Hilda, so it's settled.

08:42.288 --> 08:46.122
I am going to the wedding with Henry,
which is really weird.

08:46.158 --> 08:49.093
And Daniel is going with Trista,
which is...

08:49.128 --> 08:51.756
Well, it is what it is.
Anyway, call me when you get this.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.493
God, I don't know how this day
could get any more complicated.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.727
Sorry. Mr. Dunne.

08:58.504 --> 09:01.769
Hi! What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in London?

09:01.807 --> 09:03.502
I'm here to see you.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.343
You have exactly the right voice
for a new magazine I'm starting.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.474
<i>A sort of younger person's New Yorker.</i>

09:11.183 --> 09:12.673
Oh, my God.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.017
Really?

09:15.855 --> 09:18.619
I think my voice
would be perfect for that!

09:18.658 --> 09:22.094
Yes, I love your shrill American
enthusiasm.

09:22.128 --> 09:26.326
So, what? You... You want me
to contribute to your new magazine?

09:26.365 --> 09:29.493
No. I want you to help me run it.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.338
In London.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.487
He's leaving on Sunday.
And he wants an answer by then.

09:54.527 --> 09:59.021
Wow, Henry's in town,
you got a new job offer,

09:59.065 --> 10:00.657
you're having quite a day.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.930
I am getting married in three days.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.736
I swear to God, if you upstage me,
I will stab you in the heart.

10:07.773 --> 10:12.403
Hilda! Come on, eat something already,
please. You're scaring me.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.313
Besides, I know I'm not taking the job.
It's less money and it's in London.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.582
Whatever makes you happy.
I got to go.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.883
I got a thousand things to do.
And Justin is no help.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.445
He's always off with that Austin kid.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.583
Well, you know,
he's got a new friend, and...

10:40.673 --> 10:42.538
I just want to get a feel for your colors

10:42.575 --> 10:45.066
before we hit the store
and start racking up credit card debt.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.102
I love shopping more
than my own grandmother.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.842
Please, I skipped my nana's funeral
to go to the mall.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.110
Okay.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.777
I can see that we need to stay away
from anything in the salmon family.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.617
Mostly because I hate salmon.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.147
I hate salmon, too. I hate all fish colors.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.489
Me, too.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.189
You know, there is something
about you that I automatically liked.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.393
And that is not a come-on, because
you are just too old and too gay for me.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.993
There is nothing I like more
than a backhanded compliment.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.563
Me, too.
Okay, we are like the same woman.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.369
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.640
I'm totally setting you up
with my best friend, Marc.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.443
Well, I wasn't thinking of that,
but I totally am now.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.813
- How weird is that?
- That's eerie.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.723
I'm not surprised
you got offered that job in London.

11:32.758 --> 11:33.850
Your blog is amazing.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.724
Give me that. It's mine.
Thanks.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.491
And it doesn't hurt that
you have a slight British accent now.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.193
- I do not!
- There it is. "I do not. "

11:41.233 --> 11:43.633
- Say "crumpet. " Say "crumpet. "
- Stop! No! No!

11:43.669 --> 11:46.934
Come on, you had it on the message
that you left me.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.166
Yeah.

11:49.075 --> 11:52.272
About that message, I'm sorry.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.048
I am really glad
you're coming to Hilda's wedding.

11:56.082 --> 12:00.143
I was just a little nervous
about what you might read into it.

12:01.654 --> 12:05.522
Right, that you might be opening
something back up?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.357
Yeah. Exactly.

12:08.394 --> 12:13.195
It's just, it was so complicated before
and had so many obstacles, and...

12:13.232 --> 12:16.258
Yeah. I need to tell you something.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.396
The reason that I'm here.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.236
I have a job interview tomorrow.

12:23.042 --> 12:26.170
Head of accounting
at a very big law firm.

12:26.212 --> 12:29.841
And they're telling me
that essentially the job's mine, so...

12:30.549 --> 12:31.709
Wow.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.551
So you're moving back to New York?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.787
Yeah.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.950
Charlie's gonna go to school
at Parsons,

12:39.992 --> 12:41.755
and little Nate's gonna spend
half his time with her

12:41.794 --> 12:43.284
and half his time with me.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.887
So, I'll be here.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.627
Maybe it's not such a bad thing
that you're not taking that job.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.373
I don't know what to say.
That's... That's huge.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.504
Yeah.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.413
Let's make it a little smaller.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.472
Do you want to have
breakfast tomorrow?

13:06.485 --> 13:07.679
Yeah.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.220
Great.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.890
Hey, Daniel, look who's here.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.328
Hey, little guy. I mean, him.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.593
It's great to see you, man.
Betty said you're back in town for a bit?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.934
Yeah, hopefully, longer than a bit.
I'm interviewing for a job tomorrow, so...

13:25.971 --> 13:29.236
- Daddy. Look what I found.
- Nate, where did you get that shoe?

13:29.275 --> 13:31.106
It's mine.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.737
- No, honey. Sorry.
- I'll find the real owner.

13:33.779 --> 13:37.613
Okay. Well, it was good to see you.
I'll see you tomorrow for breakfast.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.742
- It's a date.
- Okay.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.217
- Bye, Nate.
- Say "bye. "

13:40.252 --> 13:41.617
- Atta boy.
- See you tomorrow.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.121
Okay, bye.

13:44.323 --> 13:48.089
So, what's going on?
He's back and "it's a date"?

13:48.594 --> 13:51.427
No, it's not a date. It's a breakfast.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.260
I don't know why you want to go down
this road again.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.199
I don't want to see you get hurt.

13:55.234 --> 13:59.034
That's very sweet, Daniel,
but I'm not on that road.

13:59.071 --> 14:03.474
I don't know what road I'm on,
but whatever it is, it's totally new.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.537
Here you go, Bobby.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.812
Justin, hold on.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.582
Have you decided on the long tie,
the bow tie, or the open collar,

14:15.621 --> 14:17.816
which I hate,
but you said you can pull off.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.354
You decide. I'm going to meet Austin.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.725
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just hanging out.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.430
Why is everything with Austin
always such a big secret?

14:30.469 --> 14:33.199
No secret. Austin's a good kid,
they're both good kids.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.332
Everything's cool. So...

14:36.342 --> 14:39.106
What's going on?
Do you know something?

14:39.144 --> 14:43.774
No. I don't know anything.
What? What would I know?

14:43.816 --> 14:46.546
You do know something.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.611
I swear to God, Bobby,
you'd better tell me.

14:50.489 --> 14:53.515
No, I can't.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.288
I'm not gonna break that promise.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.555
He's on drugs.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.086
Oh, my God, that Austin kid
has got my baby hooked on drugs?

14:59.131 --> 15:00.792
It's not drugs.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.399
Well, then what is it, Bobby?

15:04.870 --> 15:06.667
Because I cannot think
of another reason

15:06.705 --> 15:09.265
why my son is always
spending time with Austin.

15:09.308 --> 15:14.245
Suddenly he's sneaking off all the time,
or he's up in the room with the door...

15:15.014 --> 15:17.448
Oh.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.115
Yeah. Look, you didn't hear that
from me, all right?

15:29.995 --> 15:32.930
Thank God. Where have you been?

15:33.465 --> 15:35.126
You lied to me.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.827
You told me that my father was dead.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.738
I'm sorry you had to find out that way.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.506
And I want to talk to you about it.
But not while you've been drinking.

15:45.544 --> 15:46.909
We need to get you some help.

15:46.946 --> 15:51.349
No, the only thing that I want from you
is shares of your company.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.716
- You don't mean that.
- How do you know what I mean?

15:54.753 --> 15:56.516
Tyler! Stop it!

15:56.555 --> 16:00.150
You don't know anything about me.
You got rid of me.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.821
Oh, my God, honey. I'm sorry.

16:02.861 --> 16:08.299
No! No, no! You just figure out a way to
make it happen, or I go to Cal Hartley.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.735
And I know that that's the last thing
that you want.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.510
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.539
Hi. You brought Nate.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.551
Yeah, we had a change of schedule.
Is that okay?

16:26.585 --> 16:28.416
Of course. Hi, Nate.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.081
Whoa!

16:30.122 --> 16:31.646
Hey.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.523
- Sorry, he hasn't had his coffee.
- That's okay.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.360
Hey, I found this in my suitcase.
I wanted to show you.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.625
- Wow.
- Can I see?

16:42.668 --> 16:46.536
- Oh, my God. We're so different.
Look.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.200
Yeah.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.338
- This feels great.
- Yeah, this is nice.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.712
Whoa. I am so sorry. You...

16:55.748 --> 16:57.113
- You okay? I'm sorry.
- Yeah...

16:57.149 --> 17:00.607
- Can you please keep your kid quiet?
- I'm sorry, he's not my kid.

17:00.652 --> 17:01.676
Ow!

17:02.221 --> 17:03.381
Um...

17:04.490 --> 17:05.855
- Sorry. That was...
It's okay.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.483
- Sorry, I didn't mean that.
- Let me get him.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.618
- That sounded terrible. I love kids.
- Come on, buddy.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.288
I... I do want kids.

17:11.329 --> 17:15.164
You know, I want, like, 20.
Just one day. You know, not now.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.723
It's okay.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.337
There you go, sweetie. Okay?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.271
That's good, just...

17:22.473 --> 17:25.375
Hey, I wanted to tell you that piece
that you did in your blog

17:25.411 --> 17:28.039
about the female guard
at Buckingham Palace was amazing.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.049
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.675
That was... That was...

17:32.718 --> 17:34.652
I was just so inspired in London.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.085
And it would have been
such a perfect piece

17:36.121 --> 17:37.247
- for this new magazine.
- Honey. I'm sorry.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.120
- You know what, sweetie?
- But maybe I could find a way to...

17:39.158 --> 17:41.319
Donuts are dead food. Okay?

17:41.727 --> 17:43.786
<i>...get it to work for Mode.</i>

17:46.598 --> 17:48.759
I'm sorry. I'm listening.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.292
You know what? It's fine.
I have to get to work anyway.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.361
- But this has been really fun.
- Sure.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.633
Thank you.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.402
Have a good day, guys. Hi, Hilda.

17:56.775 --> 18:00.768
Betty! Justin's got a boyfriend!
Meet me at your place at 1:00!

18:02.815 --> 18:05.010
Wow, pretty good arm.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.711
Although, I probably could have
done the same thing, you know,

18:08.754 --> 18:10.119
if I warmed up a little.

18:10.155 --> 18:14.683
He is not in his right mind.
This is not the boy I've gotten to know.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.318
Mom, you've known him
a couple of weeks.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.489
You sound pretty naive. I mean,
even Wilhelmina saw this coming.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.931
Wilhelmina? What did she say?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.958
She said it was gonna come to money.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.300
Which is why I offered him a check
when we were at the club.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.364
- You offered him money?
- Yeah. Apparently not enough.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.137
And you're taking advice
from Wilhelmina?

18:31.176 --> 18:33.201
Doesn't that seem
like a dumb thing to do?

18:33.245 --> 18:35.611
No, it doesn't. Not when she's right.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.172
It's Trista.
Sorry, I've got to take this. Hey.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.715
Marc, just give Spencer a chance.

18:43.755 --> 18:47.782
You will love him.
He's like me but with junk.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.954
I can't, Mandy.
I am still grieving over Troy.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.432
I don't think I'll ever be able
to be in a relationship again.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.366
He's like me with big junk.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.568
Why am I getting an email
from Ignacio Suarez?

19:03.408 --> 19:04.875
Oh, my God!

19:09.047 --> 19:13.177
Well, I like the enthusiasm,

19:13.218 --> 19:15.982
but is this all a little bit too much?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.454
Yeah. It is. Listen to her!

19:17.489 --> 19:19.719
Come on, can't we wait
until after the wedding at least?

19:19.758 --> 19:23.250
This is one of the most important things
that will ever happen to Justin

19:23.295 --> 19:25.024
and he needs to know
that we accept him.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.621
We told him to come here after class.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.656
And when he walks in,
we're all gonna shout...

19:28.700 --> 19:32.568
- We know you're gay and that's okay!
- We know you're gay and that's okay!

19:35.641 --> 19:37.609
Okay, so maybe we put that in the card.

19:37.643 --> 19:42.376
Well, Justin does like a good party.
And colorful things.

19:42.414 --> 19:45.349
That's the gay flag.
Gays do not have a favorite color.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.715
They like them all.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.688
<i>Mi hija, look at all these groups
they have, PFLAG, GLSEN...</i>

19:50.722 --> 19:53.714
And everything came
in this fun starter kit.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.886
And look, a strawberry lip balm.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.021
God, this is so gonna bite me
in the ass.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.656
Please.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.724
Stop! Stop this right now!

20:02.768 --> 20:03.894
They like to make entrances.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.394
Have you people lost your minds?
You cannot do this.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.498
Why not? We're fine with it.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.136
It's not about you being fine with it.
It's about Justin being fine with it.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.738
Really? You know,
I expected you to know better.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.147
Well, why do I always
have to know better?

20:18.183 --> 20:20.777
Thanks. Thank you. You saved my life.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.016
Would you listen to the man?
Come on, he... He's an expert.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.820
What is with this family?
I mean, it is one thing to be accepting...

20:26.858 --> 20:29.224
We're just trying to help.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.890
If Justin is ever gonna have
loving and sustaining relationships,

20:32.931 --> 20:36.230
it is important for him
to feel the acceptance of his family.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.463
That... That's a pretty big statement.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.199
No, it is true.
It is in everything that we have read.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.107
Just because your mother
doesn't accept your homosexuality

20:44.142 --> 20:45.575
does not mean that I won't have a last...

20:45.611 --> 20:48.944
Does not mean that
one won't have a lasting relationship.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.175
But I do accept it.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.342
Yeah, Marc, who are we talking about?

20:53.619 --> 20:55.314
It's right here.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.853
Just...

20:59.958 --> 21:01.619
Don't believe everything you read,
okay?

21:01.660 --> 21:04.094
Justin will come out
when Justin wants to come out.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.393
And then you will all act surprised,

21:06.431 --> 21:09.832
and you will never ever mention
this hideous idea.

21:10.335 --> 21:12.235
Oh! No!

21:12.771 --> 21:14.295
They like their exits, too.

21:17.676 --> 21:18.836
I'll go out with Spencer.

21:18.877 --> 21:19.935
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.139
Who says I can't have
a healthy relationship?

21:22.814 --> 21:24.441
He might have just
been thinking casual sex.

21:24.483 --> 21:27.884
But he's coming to the wedding,
so you guys can totally figure it out.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.295
Higher. Nice. Chin up, chin up.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.331
Make sure you get them here. Here up.

21:50.375 --> 21:54.436
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

21:54.479 --> 21:59.473
but I know you got to Tyler.
This has your stink all over it.

21:59.518 --> 22:02.783
Claire, have you escaped
from your handlers again?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.255
Or have they allowed you
a senior outing?

22:05.290 --> 22:09.784
This boy is an alcoholic. He is troubled.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.286
Isn't that the pickled lush
calling the kettle black?

22:13.932 --> 22:15.957
You bitch!

22:16.001 --> 22:17.491
- Hey!
- Ow!

22:18.370 --> 22:20.304
- You watch it!
- You... You...

22:20.339 --> 22:21.806
- Get... You get over...
- You... You...

22:21.840 --> 22:23.330
You crazy...

22:37.823 --> 22:41.623
You see that?
Everyone! She attacked me!

22:41.660 --> 22:43.457
Stay away from my son!

22:49.334 --> 22:50.392
Hey, what are you doing here?

22:50.435 --> 22:52.562
I was just about to leave.
Is everything okay?

22:52.604 --> 22:54.435
- I'm not getting that job.
- What?

22:54.473 --> 22:57.340
Yeah, apparently, my old boss called
and gave me a bad recommendation.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.866
Wilhelmina?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.436
Nope.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.640
Daniel, you cost him his job!

23:02.681 --> 23:04.649
I'm your friend.
Don't I have the right to protect you

23:04.683 --> 23:06.617
when I see you making
such a big mistake?

23:06.651 --> 23:09.916
No, you don't!
And who said it was a mistake?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.389
You are moving backwards.
You have so much ahead of you.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.551
Oh, my God,
talk about moving backwards.

23:14.593 --> 23:17.153
What are you doing with Trista?
Aren't you past that?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.662
That is so completely different.

23:18.697 --> 23:21.029
You know what? Let's just make a deal.

23:21.066 --> 23:25.059
I will stay out of your personal life
and you stay out of mine.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.256
I have some
nail polish remover in the bathroom.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.056
I heard you can get a buzz off that.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.663
Don't go through my things.

23:52.697 --> 23:56.428
- Claire's not gonna give me anything.
- Be patient, she will.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.232
Yeah, well, why should she?
I'm nothing to her.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.297
I'm just some stupid piece
of white trash

24:02.340 --> 24:04.535
that's here ruining her perfect life.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.703
Tyler, pull it together.

24:06.745 --> 24:09.714
I know you're angry.
You have every right to be.

24:09.748 --> 24:12.808
But don't take it out on yourself.
Channel it.

24:12.851 --> 24:15.342
Channel it towards Claire Meade.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.485
What a crap day.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.111
So, we both have the same one.
That's cool, right?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.983
- Totally, yeah, I love it.
- Me, too.

24:49.354 --> 24:52.721
My mom won't really let up
about you coming to the wedding.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.225
Well, I will, if you want me to.

24:55.861 --> 24:58.056
- It's okay if you don't.
- I do. I do.

24:58.096 --> 25:01.930
I just... I feel like I'm gonna be
under some sort of microscope.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.060
I get it. It's okay.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.468
But, you know, if I do go,
no one would have to know anything.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.939
I just like hanging out with you.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.203
- You know what, you should come.
- You sure?

25:13.245 --> 25:14.769
- Yeah.
- Cool.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.446
- Is it dumb to have the same bracelet?
- Yes, I totally hate the color.

25:19.484 --> 25:20.917
- Want to take it back?
- Yeah.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.442
Let's do it.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.646
You know,
my face isn't actually perfect.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.590
But it works on me.

25:28.627 --> 25:31.425
Do you know if I hadn't spilled
my drink on you at the Revlon party,

25:31.463 --> 25:32.794
we wouldn't have met?

25:32.831 --> 25:36.164
Yeah, I know.
It was a real blessing in the skies.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.135
Wait. "Blessing in the skies"?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.773
- Does that sound weird?
- No, no, that's right.

25:42.807 --> 25:45.469
Blessing in the skies.
The party was outside.

25:45.510 --> 25:46.670
Right.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.111
I wonder what you would say
if we met inside.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.012
Because, you know, there's no sky.

25:52.183 --> 25:55.243
Irregardless, Trista,
we should probably get going.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.653
Did I just say "irregardless"?
Is that a word?

25:57.689 --> 26:00.556
I don't know. Do you like my earrings?

26:00.592 --> 26:01.854
Yeah.

26:27.018 --> 26:31.512
Great news! I got the job.
Daniel must have called them back.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.081
Good.
I knew he would do the right thing.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.525
Yeah, well, thank you.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.290
- Come in.
- Great.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.126
Wow, Betty, this place is amazing.

26:42.834 --> 26:43.960
Hey, do you want to go celebrate?

26:44.002 --> 26:46.402
I thought maybe we could go to
that Thai restaurant we used to love.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.770
- It's not there anymore.
- Oh.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.701
Henry, can we talk...

26:52.744 --> 26:56.407
"Affordable London apartments"?
Are you thinking about taking that job?

26:56.448 --> 27:00.350
No. No, no, I was just curious. I... No.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.115
Well, if you're thinking about
taking it, I'd just kind of like to know.

27:03.154 --> 27:06.590
No, I'm not. I'm not. I was just looking.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.527
It's just a really great opportunity,
it's sort of hard to let go of, so...

27:10.562 --> 27:14.191
Well, why are you letting it go?

27:14.232 --> 27:16.393
- It's not because of me, is it?
- No.

27:16.434 --> 27:19.369
Because I do not want to be the one
that keeps you from living your life.

27:19.404 --> 27:20.701
If you wanna take that job,
then you should.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.866
You should take it, you should
travel the world if you want to.

27:22.907 --> 27:25.102
Henry, it's not you. It's...

27:25.844 --> 27:28.642
<i>My sister's getting married,
and papi's gonna be alone,</i>

27:28.680 --> 27:31.649
and there's all this stuff with Justin.
It's just...

27:31.683 --> 27:33.742
It isn't the right time.

27:37.889 --> 27:41.017
- And...
- It's not the right time for us, either.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.192
You feel that way, too?

27:45.363 --> 27:46.591
Yes.

27:48.700 --> 27:53.364
It would have been nice, though, right?
To have what we had three years ago.

27:53.972 --> 27:55.166
Yeah.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.905
- But it's not three years ago.
- It definitely isn't.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.608
- I have a wet rice cake in my pocket.
- Ew.

28:08.119 --> 28:11.384
- Listen, you still like Thai food, right?
- Yeah.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.891
See?
That's one thing that hasn't changed.

28:15.326 --> 28:17.590
No, that will never change.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.963
Okay. You know a new place?

28:19.998 --> 28:23.627
- Yeah, but you're paying still, right?
- Yes, absolutely.

28:34.779 --> 28:36.713
- Hi.
- Hi. Wow.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.739
- Are you ready?
- Is Bobby out there?

28:38.783 --> 28:40.250
His parents have him in the back.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.753
He was nervous, so they gave him
some sacramental wine.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.277
I had some, too.

28:44.322 --> 28:48.850
- God, Hilda, you look so beautiful.
Doesn't she?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.327
Oh, my God,
I just want to eat something.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.796
Mama, the second this thing is over,
you can eat your face off.

28:53.832 --> 28:57.461
Over?
This is the happiest day of my life.

29:00.705 --> 29:03.003
All right, let's do this bitch.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.438
Hey.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.011
You look great.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.119
Thank you.

29:18.823 --> 29:22.020
Thanks for helping Henry
get his job back.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.018
Betty, I'm really sorry. I should
probably go say something to him.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.759
He's not coming.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.033
You were right. I was going backwards.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.934
You okay?

29:33.972 --> 29:35.234
Yeah.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.141
We're just in two very different places.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.976
I guess you know me better
than I thought.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.642
Well, you know me pretty well, too.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.709
Trista definitely brings out
the dumb in me.

29:49.287 --> 29:52.381
- "Irregardless" isn't a word, is it?
- No.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.209
I do.

30:18.249 --> 30:19.546
I do.

30:46.544 --> 30:50.378
<i>Ay, mami. Please, I'm just
gonna welcome him to the family.</i>

30:50.849 --> 30:53.113
I love him,
but he's gonna say something stupid.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.284
Hey.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.318
And we're circulating and mingling.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.228
<i>Thank you for coming.
Hello, Aunt Spanish. You look bonita.</i>

31:07.365 --> 31:09.959
- I'm gonna get us some sodas.
- Okay.

31:12.637 --> 31:15.231
He seems nice. Are you okay?

31:15.874 --> 31:20.834
I don't know. I hate having a secret.
I just... I feel so far away from them.

31:21.346 --> 31:25.612
- Does it help that I know?
- Yeah. Even Bobby, sort of.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.278
Well, that, my friend,
is what it feels like

31:28.319 --> 31:31.846
when you don't have
to keep a secret anymore. Relief.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.887
I just feel like
everything's gonna change.

31:37.962 --> 31:41.022
It will. But for the better.

31:41.933 --> 31:46.063
But it's up to you. Only you will know
when the time is right.

31:46.104 --> 31:49.005
Marc! Here! Bye.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.635
Okay, Spencer, Marc.
Silver Fox, Purple Ferret.

31:52.677 --> 31:53.701
Hello.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.440
See, you two are totally
hitting it off already.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.742
- Yeah...
- Kiss.

31:56.781 --> 31:58.646
No... Hello.

32:00.785 --> 32:02.116
Cheers.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.552
Can I have the mic, please?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.149
<i>Thank you so much.
It is my party, I just want to talk.</i>

32:07.191 --> 32:10.285
Hey, I think your days of talking
are over, right?

32:10.328 --> 32:11.795
You're a married woman now. Sit down.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.992
<i>Oh, my God. Are you done?
Okay, good.</i>

32:15.700 --> 32:19.397
<i>I just want to say
that I'm so freaking happy.</i>

32:20.371 --> 32:22.862
<i>I just married my best friend.</i>

32:22.907 --> 32:27.207
<i>I knew that I loved Bobby...
Well, when he told me that I did.</i>

32:29.547 --> 32:30.571
<i>But he was right.</i>

32:30.615 --> 32:31.741
Come here. Sit.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.217
<i>I just needed some time to figure it out.</i>

32:34.252 --> 32:37.847
<i>But I knew that Bobby loved me</i>

32:37.889 --> 32:41.518
<i>when he told me that he would
throw himself under a bus for me.</i>

32:42.794 --> 32:46.127
<i>I know, right?
I would do that, too, baby.</i>

32:46.631 --> 32:48.690
<i>Because that's love, right?</i>

32:49.200 --> 32:51.725
<i>When you know somebody
better than they do,</i>

32:52.236 --> 32:57.640
<i>and when you would do anything
in the world to protect them.</i>

32:59.410 --> 33:01.002
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

33:06.784 --> 33:09.514
Tyler, this is the third message I've left.

33:09.554 --> 33:13.046
Dick Cheney returns my calls after one.
Call me.

33:30.174 --> 33:34.543
<i>Dancing for the very first time,
we have Mr. And Mrs. Talercio!</i>

33:34.579 --> 33:36.308
<i>Let's give it up!</i>

34:00.004 --> 34:02.564
You okay? You seem quiet.

34:04.475 --> 34:06.705
Just thinking.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.138
About the future.

34:14.518 --> 34:19.114
Sometimes it's hard to know
when to take that next step.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.918
Yeah.

34:22.326 --> 34:26.626
Someone told me that
when the time is right, you'll just know.

34:31.902 --> 34:35.737
You know you have nothing
to be afraid of, right?

34:38.409 --> 34:42.072
You... You're the bravest kid I know.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.283
May I throw you around the floor
for a while?

34:51.322 --> 34:52.687
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

34:52.723 --> 34:53.917
Okay.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.989
- Don't cry. It makes you look like a girl.
- Okay.

37:00.918 --> 37:02.613
That Austin is a cutie.

37:02.653 --> 37:03.984
- Mom!
- What?

37:04.021 --> 37:05.613
- Stop.
- Okay.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.722
- What?
- What? No, I was just...

37:13.965 --> 37:16.263
I was just thinking.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.734
See?
You're getting smarter already.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.606
You know what?

37:32.016 --> 37:35.884
Sometimes I feel like
I have to take care of everyone.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.649
But look at them.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.691
It's a great feeling, isn't it?

37:42.994 --> 37:46.430
Everything is right in the world.

37:50.635 --> 37:51.863
Yeah.

37:59.910 --> 38:03.778
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a really good person?

38:11.389 --> 38:15.416
Has anyone ever told you that you have
the mouth of a silent movie star?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.120
Sexy yet cruel.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.461
Of course.

38:20.364 --> 38:21.831
Spencer...

38:25.836 --> 38:30.535
I get that you like me.
And I like that you like me.

38:30.574 --> 38:33.543
But let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

38:33.577 --> 38:38.742
You're gonna pursue me,
and I'm gonna take advantage of that.

38:40.017 --> 38:43.919
It's kind of a pattern with me. I think...

38:47.358 --> 38:50.816
It probably has to do with my mother
rejecting me, blah, blah, blah.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.192
Anyway,

38:54.498 --> 38:56.830
I want to break that pattern.

38:58.102 --> 39:03.005
I want to have a real relationship
with someone that I really care about.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.673
I get it.

39:07.712 --> 39:11.011
So, just want to fool around
in the bushes?

39:12.850 --> 39:14.249
Kidding.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.617
Well, it's probably better.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.952
Honestly, I only said
I would go out with you

39:18.989 --> 39:21.549
because Amanda wanted me to.

39:21.592 --> 39:24.891
- I would do anything for that girl.
- Yeah.

39:24.929 --> 39:28.592
God. I am sorry. It is scratching, I...

39:29.100 --> 39:32.797
Amanda left the tag in,
in case we wanted to return it.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.935
<i>My real father
has that bird tattoo.</i>

39:42.012 --> 39:43.741
Oh, my God!

39:46.250 --> 39:49.151
Hi, Mr. Dunne,
this is Betty Suarez calling.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.120
I know that you're leaving tomorrow,

39:51.155 --> 39:54.318
so, I wanted to make sure
you got this message.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.521
I have decided that
I would like to accept your offer.

40:00.931 --> 40:04.697
I would like the job. So, yeah.

40:05.603 --> 40:08.436
Okay. Cheerio.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.511
Claire,
we need to talk about Tyler.

40:17.548 --> 40:21.211
I think I've made a terrible mistake,
but you're gonna pay the price.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.686
Wilhelmina,
I'm way too busy for your bull.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.690
For God sakes,
put your hearing aid in and listen to me!

40:26.724 --> 40:30.820
I'm trying to warn you!
That boy is dangerous.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.453
She's right.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.865
Tyler, what are you doing?

40:42.773 --> 40:45.139
Why did you have to find me?

40:46.210 --> 40:49.270
Everything was better without you.

40:50.881 --> 40:54.476
And now, it's all falling apart.

40:55.085 --> 40:58.612
- Honey, let me help you.
- No!

41:02.026 --> 41:04.460
I don't want anything from you.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.327
Tyler,

41:08.566 --> 41:14.766
if I could go back
and change everything I did,

41:16.707 --> 41:19.835
I would. But I can't.

41:20.678 --> 41:22.612
You're my son.

41:23.881 --> 41:27.510
I know you don't want to do this.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.493
Tyler, listen to me.

41:37.528 --> 41:42.556
I know you're hurting,
but Claire has nothing to do with this.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.003
You're confused and it's my fault.
I'm the one who made you feel this way.

41:47.037 --> 41:51.701
And I'm sorry. So, give me the gun

41:51.742 --> 41:55.075
and I will try to make things right.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.010
Claire loves you.
