It's your new boyfriend.

02:04.245 --> 02:05.955
How did you get this number?

02:06.123 --> 02:09.167
[Killer] You gave it to me in the chat room.

[Marcus] Me doing what?

02:30.898 --> 02:34.733
Chatting me and then calling me from some random number.

02:34.901 --> 02:37.236
The deep voice was actually kind of sexy.

Hello? Babe?

Well, if it isn't you, then somebody's playing on my phone.

02:46.995 --> 02:48.956
First, they were sending me private messages in the chat

02:49.123 --> 02:52.251

[Marcus] Really? What did they say?

02:54.879 --> 02:57.299
Nothing really. They're just playing on my phone.

[Marcus] I warned you about them chat rooms.

There's creepy people in there. I wouldn't trip, though.

You're just being paranoid.

Now, um, this all takes place in a chat room.

08:47.566 --> 08:51.610

08:51.778 --> 08:56.240
And somehow, he talks them into giving up their address.

08:56.408 --> 08:58.451

08:58.617 --> 09:00.995

09:04.666 --> 09:06.459
and stop him before he claims his next victim?

You know, that's the million dollar question.

09:12.049 --> 09:13.216
Yes, sir.

09:14.592 --> 09:16.093
What's this guy's motive?

09:16.259 --> 09:17.762
Hmm. Let's see.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.597
Let's look at the facts.

09:19.764 --> 09:23.016
It's not sex because he hasn't raped anyone.

09:23.184 --> 09:24.894
Now, there's other motivating factors

09:25.062 --> 09:26.312
when it comes to serial murders.

09:26.479 --> 09:29.190
It's, uh, financial gain,

09:29.356 --> 09:32.194
thrill-seeking, anger,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.279
and just someone looking for some goddamn attention.

09:35.446 --> 09:37.907
[Nelson] Well, we definitely know for a fact

09:38.074 --> 09:40.201
that this guy is seeking attention.

09:40.368 --> 09:42.871
Uh, so none of these girls are connected.

09:48.460 --> 09:49.919
that we're smarter.

09:50.087 --> 09:51.463
So let's put some effort into finding this guy

09:51.629 --> 09:53.548
before he kills again.

09:53.716 --> 09:56.425

11:17.256 --> 11:18.717
and yet nothing has ever happened.

[laughs]

12:57.399 --> 12:59.359
Thanks, baby.

12:59.526 --> 13:01.778
You always know how to relax me.

13:03.446 --> 13:06.158
I don't know what I would do without you.

We are about to make our final descend into New Jersey,

13:19.712 --> 13:21.505
so, um, please fasten your seatbelts

13:21.673 --> 13:23.508

[Keith] Hey, sweetie, I just landed in New Jersey.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.196
The weather is so crazy here.

13:44.362 --> 13:46.655
I don't even know if I'm gonna get a flight out tonight.

13:46.823 --> 13:48.992

14:37.124 --> 14:38.124
on the flight delay?

14:38.291 --> 14:39.458
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mitchell,

14:39.626 --> 14:41.670
there's no new information yet.

14:43.630 --> 14:44.963
Uh, I guess that was the information

14:45.131 --> 14:47.425
you were looking for. I'm so sorry.

14:47.592 --> 14:49.552
Oh, if your plane doesn't leave tonight,

we can book you in a hotel and you're more than welcome

Come on, baby.

All right. Stand like me. All right?

Hands up, baby. Come on. What's wrong?

16:06.253 --> 16:08.089
No. I need a break.

16:08.256 --> 16:09.257
It's not time yet. Let's go.

16:09.423 --> 16:11.510
I'm tired.

16:13.511 --> 16:15.263
to happen to me, but you're doing too much.

16:15.429 --> 16:17.181
Baby, I'm just trying to get you right.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.851
By taking your anger and frustration out on me?

16:20.017 --> 16:21.894
Look, I know you think it was your fault.

16:22.061 --> 16:24.522
But let's face it, Dad. She was just in the wrong place

16:24.689 --> 16:26.358
at the wrong time.

16:26.524 --> 16:28.860
I shouldn't have to pay for that and neither should you.

You're right. She was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

[Keith] I do, baby.

16:36.743 --> 16:38.286
I do.

16:38.452 --> 16:40.371
Your mother didn't know how to defend herself.

16:40.538 --> 16:42.498
And I'll be damned if something's gonna happen to you

16:42.666 --> 16:44.792
and you can't defend yourself.

16:44.958 --> 16:47.170
Understand?

16:47.337 --> 16:49.381
Yeah. I do.

Hey, sweetie.

17:08.566 --> 17:12.529
So, uh, it went from a two-hour delay to just plain delayed.

17:12.696 --> 17:14.363
I don't even know when I'm gonna get out.

17:14.531 --> 17:18.326
The weather is just crazy, so don't wait up.

17:18.493 --> 17:20.119
I'm not even sure when, uh,

17:20.287 --> 17:22.621
they're gonna open up lights again.

17:22.789 --> 17:24.332
Well, Dad, that's just too bad

17:24.499 --> 17:25.875
that you're gonna have to miss the house party

17:26.042 --> 17:27.375
I'm throwing tonight.

17:27.544 --> 17:28.961
Very funny.

17:30.003 --> 17:33.091
I guess it's just me and old Anky, then.

17:33.257 --> 17:34.717
[Keith] Well, it's your last day,

17:34.882 --> 17:36.428
so you should be excited.

17:36.594 --> 17:38.180
I'd be more excited if I was going to the bonfire

17:38.346 --> 17:39.472
with the rest of my friends,

17:39.638 --> 17:42.184
instead I'm stuck on house arrest.

17:42.349 --> 17:44.477
Well, sweetie. You did give that girl a concussion,

17:44.643 --> 17:45.769
what do you expect?

17:45.937 --> 17:47.940
She talked about mom.

17:48.106 --> 17:49.566
[Keith] Look, sweetie,

17:49.732 --> 17:52.400
losing your mother was tough on both of us.

17:52.569 --> 17:54.071
Still no excuse to fight.

17:54.237 --> 17:56.323
It's no excuse, but it is the entire reason

17:56.489 --> 17:58.282
why you taught me how to fight.

17:58.449 --> 18:00.910
No, no, I taught you to fight to protect yourself,

18:01.078 --> 18:03.580
not to go beating up anybody who talks about your mother.

18:05.081 --> 18:06.833
She got what she deserved.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.126
[Keith] Don't say that.

18:08.292 --> 18:10.002
[Alexis] I learned my lesson, okay?

18:10.169 --> 18:12.881
I'm not gonna fight anymore unless to protect myself,

18:13.047 --> 18:14.382
especially if that means

18:14.548 --> 18:16.884
I have to be stuck in this house like a prisoner.

18:17.050 --> 18:18.511
[Keith] Well, it could be worse.

18:18.677 --> 18:21.138
You could be in a six by eight cell with no light.

18:21.305 --> 18:22.347
[Alexis] I get it, Dad.

18:22.515 --> 18:24.476
But fighting is what I do.

18:24.642 --> 18:27.936
[Keith] Not as a means of communication, young lady.

18:28.104 --> 18:29.481
True.

18:29.648 --> 18:32.025
So it's dark on the East Coast, right?

18:32.191 --> 18:34.817
Yes. Dark, rainy, and then annoying.

18:34.985 --> 18:36.780
And then don't think that I didn't notice

18:36.946 --> 18:38.990
you just changed the subject on me.

18:39.947 --> 18:41.535
God, I hate flying.

18:41.701 --> 18:44.162
I know, Dad, but you're gonna be okay.

18:44.328 --> 18:47.456
Just let me know before your flight takes off.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.174
And can you please stop with the jokes about my daddy?

19:37.339 --> 19:40.343
That is so disgusting and irritating.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.929
Yeah, well, the best friend's job

19:43.096 --> 19:44.681
is never done if you're not irritated.

Uh-hmm, well, then, you're definitely my best friend.

19:46.432 --> 19:48.017

19:48.185 --> 19:49.143
So you're really not coming to the bonfire tonight?

19:49.311 --> 19:50.937
Oh, girl, unless the bonfire

19:51.104 --> 19:53.482
is on my own lawn, then no.

19:53.647 --> 19:55.442
Can't you just cut that little thing off or something?

19:55.608 --> 19:56.568
-Oh, this? -[Tessa] Yeah.

19:56.734 --> 19:58.110

Just right here and then the police

19:59.862 --> 20:02.323
will be here in 20 minutes to arrest me.

20:02.490 --> 20:05.159
[laughs] It's only one day left,

20:05.327 --> 20:06.745
that should be the exception.

20:06.911 --> 20:09.413
The exception was me not going to jail.

20:09.581 --> 20:11.416
-And that part. -[laughs]

20:11.583 --> 20:13.709
Dang, girl, I knew there was something I wanted to tell you.

20:13.876 --> 20:15.378
Did you hear about that girl over the news?

20:15.544 --> 20:17.506
Tess, there's hundreds of girls on the news.

20:17.672 --> 20:19.632
Can you be more specific?

20:19.798 --> 20:22.176
Yeah, there's this crazy man who beat this girl to death.

20:22.342 --> 20:23.762
It was all over The Gram.

20:23.928 --> 20:26.723
Oh, my dad made me delete IG off my phone

20:26.889 --> 20:28.474
as a form of punishment.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.892
Hmm. Yeah, they're saying

20:30.059 --> 20:31.603
he's some type of copycat killer,

20:31.769 --> 20:34.522
going around killing women when they're home alone.

20:34.688 --> 20:36.691
-That's crazy. -[Tessa] Yeah.

20:36.858 --> 20:39.235
He's probably looking for his next victim right now,

20:39.402 --> 20:41.946
so you better be careful in this outside all by yourself.

20:43.072 --> 20:44.781
Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself,

20:44.948 --> 20:46.575
but I'm worried about you.

20:46.743 --> 20:48.120
Gosh. You ain't got to worry about me,

20:55.002 --> 20:56.753
and pretend that I was there with y'all.

Yes, I did, and tell Tessa to stop with that.

[Nelson] This is our suspect Justin Humphries,

23:41.251 --> 23:42.502
we're really closing on with this--

23:42.669 --> 23:44.378
That eyewitness that puts the black Ford

23:44.546 --> 23:46.213
at Trina's house hours before she was murdered?

23:46.380 --> 23:48.050
Uh-hmm. And what about at the time of the murder?

23:48.216 --> 23:49.675
[Gibson] At the time of the murder,

23:49.841 --> 23:52.010
that same eyewitness says the car wasn't there.

23:52.177 --> 23:53.263
But you ready for this?

23:53.430 --> 23:55.848
A street cam puts that same car

23:56.015 --> 23:57.434
about a block away from the house

23:57.600 --> 24:00.228
from the hours of 1:50 and 2:20 AM.

24:00.394 --> 24:03.231
Hmm. That sounds really interesting.

24:05.692 --> 24:06.943
Is there any surveillance footage?

24:07.109 --> 24:09.195
-I'm already working on it. -Uh-hmm.

24:10.697 --> 24:12.824
This is our guy.

24:12.991 --> 24:15.243
I need that surveillance footage right away.

24:15.409 --> 24:16.744
It's done.

24:20.539 --> 24:22.750
This is, um, Sarah Gutierrez.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.336
She's the one that got away, right?

24:24.502 --> 24:26.170
Yes, sir.

24:26.338 --> 24:27.755
We should bring her in for questioning.

24:27.921 --> 24:29.382
[Nelson] Right away, sir.

24:29.549 --> 24:31.384
FBI might come in handy after at all.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.927
Uh-hmm. All right, brother.

24:33.094 --> 24:34.178
All right. Getting close, man.

26:04.978 --> 26:06.479
I will be.

26:06.646 --> 26:08.397
Now, I see how you gave that chick a concussion.

26:08.564 --> 26:09.815
How did you get in anyways?

26:09.982 --> 26:11.735
I should have heard the alarm.

26:11.901 --> 26:13.070
Your dad let me in.

26:13.236 --> 26:14.112
He should have called me.

26:14.278 --> 26:15.572
I could have killed you.

26:15.738 --> 26:18.908
I know, but I wasn't gonna let my baby

26:19.076 --> 26:20.493
spent the night alone

26:20.659 --> 26:22.495
while all our friends go to the bonfire.

26:23.830 --> 26:25.373
I mean, what kind of man would I be?

26:26.499 --> 26:29.543

26:33.256 --> 26:34.673
I made the banner myself. You like it?

26:34.841 --> 26:36.843
Aw, it's so sweet.

26:37.009 --> 26:39.303
I love it. Thank you, baby.

26:39.471 --> 26:40.596
-You didn't have to do that. -No problem.

26:40.764 --> 26:42.055
I wanted to.

26:42.223 --> 26:43.350
I wasn't gonna let you be the only one

26:43.515 --> 26:45.684
-that miss the bonfire. -Hmm.

26:45.852 --> 26:47.353

26:50.814 --> 26:52.065

[crickets chirping]

27:09.625 --> 27:12.504
You know, my dad's flight got delayed,

27:12.670 --> 27:14.505
so he won't be home until tomorrow.

27:14.671 --> 27:15.798
[scoffs]

27:15.964 --> 27:17.384
I know, he told me that.

27:17.550 --> 27:19.886
And he told me I can leave by 9:00.

27:20.053 --> 27:22.012
But he can see when I leave, so if I don't leave by 9:00,

27:22.178 --> 27:25.058
-he gonna call my dad. -[laughs]

27:25.224 --> 27:29.187
Oh, my God. My dad is so extra.

27:30.939 --> 27:33.357
Well, at least we got a couple of hours to chill.

27:40.156 --> 27:41.283
Not so bad.

27:41.449 --> 27:43.201
[Alexis chuckles]

27:43.367 --> 27:45.453
But that is so good.

27:45.619 --> 27:46.830
Hmm.

27:48.372 --> 27:49.622
What about your little ankle thing?

27:49.790 --> 27:50.708
Won't it, like, go off or something?

27:50.875 --> 27:51.834
As long as I'm in the house,

27:51.999 --> 27:53.502
no, it won't go off.

27:53.670 --> 27:54.921
Well, can you go outside?

27:55.088 --> 27:56.630
How many times do I have to tell you?

27:56.798 --> 27:58.382
Yes.

27:58.548 --> 28:00.093
As long as I'm within a hundred feet of the tracker,

28:00.259 --> 28:02.887
which is in the kitchen on the Wi-Fi.

28:03.054 --> 28:05.057
What if the power is out and the Wi-Fi is not working?

28:05.223 --> 28:06.766
It has a backup system

28:06.932 --> 28:09.268
that sends the signals to the police. [chuckles]

28:09.434 --> 28:13.731
So basically there ain't no way to trick this little baby.

28:15.817 --> 28:17.736
So...

28:17.902 --> 28:20.071
if I wanna get a little freaky on the front porch, we could?

28:20.238 --> 28:23.574
[chuckles]

28:23.742 --> 28:27.579
You're crazy, but yes, nasty.

28:27.745 --> 28:30.790
I think I could get about as far as the mailbox.

28:30.957 --> 28:32.709
But if I'm out of range,

28:32.875 --> 28:34.585
the red light flashes.

28:34.752 --> 28:36.254
And I have about 10 seconds to get back

28:36.420 --> 28:38.089
before it sends an alert to the police.

28:38.256 --> 28:39.715
Wow.

28:39.882 --> 28:41.468
That's super detailed. I didn't know that.

28:41.635 --> 28:45.221

28:56.608 --> 28:58.192
Of course, I have to drug and rape you,

28:58.359 --> 29:00.820
because you're such a good little boy.

39:55.975 --> 39:59.520
Um, listen, I just saw someone on the camera

39:59.687 --> 40:02.063
breaking into the side of the house. Okay?

40:02.231 --> 40:03.900

40:24.963 --> 40:28.382
My dad saw you on the camera coming through the side door.

40:28.550 --> 40:31.593
And he thinks somebody broke into the house.

40:31.759 --> 40:33.471
You're the one who told me to come over.

40:53.783 --> 40:55.826
Thank you so much.

40:55.993 --> 40:57.370
Tess was right. We never have anything

40:57.536 --> 40:59.162
to eat up in this house.

41:00.373 --> 41:01.748
So, you mean you're telling me this is a snacky call,

41:01.915 --> 41:03.084
-not a booty call? -Well, when I get

41:03.250 --> 41:04.543
this thing off my ankle,

41:04.711 --> 41:05.712
then maybe it'll be a booty call.

41:05.878 --> 41:07.214
But until then,

41:07.380 --> 41:09.339
you're just a late night food cart guy.

41:09.506 --> 41:11.800
See? I told you that I would be able to sneak out the house

41:11.967 --> 41:13.052
without my pops noticing.

41:14.094 --> 41:15.429
You want me to stay?

41:16.472 --> 41:18.891
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

41:19.057 --> 41:21.684
Plus, you gotta sneak back in without him noticing.

41:21.852 --> 41:23.937
[scoffs] Right.

41:24.105 --> 41:27.023
But here's a little something, something [indistinct]

41:29.360 --> 41:31.320
He's probably the only one with access to all the cameras.

41:31.487 --> 41:34.198
The only thing I can think of is he had a camera installed

41:34.365 --> 41:35.824
without me knowing.

41:36.909 --> 41:39.369
Damn. He got you on a serious lockdown.

41:39.536 --> 41:41.373
What we did [indistinct] he shall see?

41:41.538 --> 41:45.251
It's not what I did. It's what happened to my mother.

41:45.418 --> 41:47.211
Oh, shit.

41:48.671 --> 41:50.089
That makes sense.

41:51.548 --> 41:52.634
Damn, so he saw me?

41:52.801 --> 41:53.967
Yeah.

41:56.887 --> 41:58.181
What are we gonna do?

41:58.347 --> 41:59.515
I have to try to figure out a way

41:59.682 --> 42:00.975
to explain it to him.

42:01.142 --> 42:02.601
I tried to call him, but his phone

42:02.769 --> 42:04.603
is going to voicemail.

42:04.771 --> 42:06.064
He's still on the plane,

42:06.230 --> 42:08.065
so the Wi-Fi is probably tripping.

42:08.232 --> 42:10.360
All right. Well, let me know how that goes.

42:27.626 --> 42:29.086
How long does it take for the Wi-Fi to connect?

42:29.252 --> 42:30.796
[Beverly] It does take a few moments, sir.

42:30.964 --> 42:32.549
Don't you guys have an airplane phone I could use?

42:32.715 --> 42:34.175
It's against airline policies

42:34.341 --> 42:36.468
to allow our passengers to use our phone.

42:36.635 --> 42:38.886
For all we know, you could have fabricated your story.

42:39.054 --> 42:41.473
The best thing I can do is allow you to use your own phone.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.435
This is ridiculous. My daughter could be dead by now.

01:06:11.183 --> 01:06:12.685
I'm upstairs, I'm in my room.

01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:14.521
He's in the house, please.

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.106
Ma'am, I'm here to help.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:20.193
Tell me where in the house you're located

01:06:20.358 --> 01:06:21.485
and I'm here to assist you.

01:06:21.654 --> 01:06:23.236
Look out, he's behind you!

01:06:24.238 --> 01:06:25.613
-[neck snaps] -[Alexis] No!

01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:39.879
Dad, please, please, he killed the officer.

01:06:40.047 --> 01:06:41.422
I'm scared. I don't wanna die.

01:06:41.588 --> 01:06:43.631
-What do I do? -Your ankle monitor.

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:45.177
I need you to use your ankle monitor

01:06:45.342 --> 01:06:47.261
to alert the police. Try to sneak out

01:06:47.429 --> 01:06:48.929
and get as far away as you can.

01:06:49.096 --> 01:06:50.263

01:06:50.431 --> 01:06:52.059
Baby? Hello?

01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:54.101
Dammit! Not now!

01:06:54.268 --> 01:06:56.855
Please tell me you have some backup Wi-Fi on this plane?

01:06:57.021 --> 01:06:58.064
I mean, what... it's got to be connected

01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:59.649
to the air traffic controller

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.442
or whatever the hell sends a signal out here.

01:07:01.608 --> 01:07:03.402
Yes, but it has nothing to do with home Wi-Fi, Keith.

01:07:03.569 --> 01:07:05.197
But isn't there anything you could do?

01:07:05.362 --> 01:07:06.906
Unfortunately, Keith, we just have to wait for it

01:07:07.073 --> 01:07:09.117
-to turn back on. -Okay, goddammit!

01:07:09.284 --> 01:07:10.618
If something happens to my baby girl,

01:07:10.784 --> 01:07:11.870
I'm gonna sue this damn airline!

01:07:12.036 --> 01:07:13.411
Keith, I need you to calm down!

01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:15.539
And remember, I am on your side!

01:07:15.707 --> 01:07:17.584
You heard what she said, right?

01:07:17.749 --> 01:07:20.627
That-that guy killed the police officer we sent out.

01:07:20.794 --> 01:07:22.838
What are we supposed to do? What?!

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.049
[Beverly] Everybody, please stay calm.

01:07:25.216 --> 01:07:26.592
Everything is going to be okay.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.677
I need you guys to remain seated.

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:31.723
Please, remain seated, keep your seatbelts on.

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:33.975

[tense music]

01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:49.616
I got a strange call

01:07:49.782 --> 01:07:52.119
directed to Inglewood PD from an airplane.

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.994
Sent an officer by to take a look

01:07:54.162 --> 01:07:55.412
and he said it was all clear.

01:07:55.578 --> 01:07:56.956
And you're telling me this why?

01:07:57.124 --> 01:07:59.082
The address belongs to Keith Mitchell.

01:07:59.251 --> 01:08:01.377
His daughter Alexis' own house arrest.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:02.586
Mitchell...

01:08:04.506 --> 01:08:07.384
Detective, I have an Alexis Mitchell for you.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.592
Please, ma'am.

01:08:11.094 --> 01:08:12.221
Have a seat.

01:08:17.644 --> 01:08:19.228
Where's your father?

01:08:19.396 --> 01:08:20.729
He's on a business trip.

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:22.440
He told me to come.

01:08:22.607 --> 01:08:24.317
I'll share everything with him later.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:26.945
I called you in because I wanted to discuss

01:08:27.112 --> 01:08:28.320
something with the both of you.

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:30.697
But since your father's not here,

01:08:30.864 --> 01:08:32.241
I guess I'll share it with you.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.078
We may have some information on your mother's killer

01:08:36.244 --> 01:08:38.246
that may be able to give you some closure.

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:39.541
Really?

01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:42.419
Mitchell.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.295
-Are you sure it's Mitchell-- -Absolutely.

01:08:44.462 --> 01:08:45.797
Shit.

01:09:00.518 --> 01:09:02.271
[Keith] Okay, baby, where are you in the house now?

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:03.731
Upstairs.

01:09:03.897 --> 01:09:05.691
I can hear him downstairs.

01:09:10.738 --> 01:09:12.240
Okay. I-I can see him.

01:09:12.406 --> 01:09:13.990
I can see him. He's on the side of the house.

01:09:14.158 --> 01:09:15.534
Go to the garage now.

01:09:15.702 --> 01:09:16.870
Okay.

What the hell happened here?

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:21.507
[Alexis] I didn't know what else to do.

Are you okay?

01:14:53.664 --> 01:14:54.707
Did he hurt you?

01:14:54.874 --> 01:14:57.252

01:14:57.419 --> 01:14:58.752
Yeah.

01:14:58.919 --> 01:15:00.712
Police told me that you-- you shot him.

01:15:00.879 --> 01:15:02.507
Dad, I don't think you're hearing me.

01:15:02.673 --> 01:15:04.133
I got "him."

01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:05.801
"Him?"

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:07.178
Where's your father?

01:15:07.345 --> 01:15:09.264
He's on a business trip.

01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:10.806
He told me to come.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.350
I'll share everything with him later.

01:15:13.434 --> 01:15:15.185

He's been in and out of jail for petty crimes.

01:15:36.289 --> 01:15:38.542
We found his DNA underneath your mother's fingernails

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:40.167
when she scratched his face.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:41.504
That's how we found him.

01:15:43.964 --> 01:15:45.842
Do you know where he is now?

01:15:46.801 --> 01:15:50.135
We're working on that now as we speak, Mrs. Mitchell.

My mother was Mrs. Mitchell.

01:15:58.479 --> 01:15:59.772
Alexis.

01:15:59.939 --> 01:16:01.398
We do know that your mother

01:16:01.565 --> 01:16:03.651
wasn't supposed to be the target.

01:16:06.487 --> 01:16:08.071
She was housesitting.

01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:10.699
[Greg] For her friend Heather, yes.

01:16:11.743 --> 01:16:14.120
Heather's daughter Joanne was a part of this chat room

01:16:14.288 --> 01:16:15.997
where teenagers meet up.

01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:18.957
That's where she met Justin.

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:20.418
How do you know this?

01:16:20.584 --> 01:16:22.254
[Greg] I spoke to Heather and Joanne,

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.463
and Joanne was supposed to be home alone that night.

01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:28.801
But she convinced her mother to allow her to go to a party.

01:16:30.343 --> 01:16:33.139
So Heather called your mother to house it.

01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:35.391
Your mother wasn't supposed to be there.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:36.976
Joanne was.

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:44.025
I want you to find this guy

01:16:44.192 --> 01:16:46.820
and I want you to lock him up forever.

01:16:46.986 --> 01:16:49.197
Nobody else should have to lose a parent or a child

01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:51.157
because of this monster.

01:16:54.327 --> 01:16:56.412
I promise you, Alexis.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.373
I'm gonna do everything in my power to find this guy.

I'll see you back at the station.

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:33.365
We have some great news.

01:17:33.532 --> 01:17:35.200
We may have a lead on Justin.

01:17:35.367 --> 01:17:37.286
I'll call you if I have any other updates.

01:17:37.454 --> 01:17:38.912
Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:42.291
[Greg] Please, don't call me Mr. Nelson.

01:17:42.459 --> 01:17:43.791
That was my father's name.

Just leave it at the door. Thank you.

01:19:30.023 --> 01:19:32.069
You better go get that door.

01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:37.530
[Alexis] Thanks.

01:19:43.328 --> 01:19:45.748
Take the mask off. Now!

01:19:56.719 --> 01:19:57.969
It's nothing personal.

01:19:58.135 --> 01:19:59.679
It was for her.

01:20:01.304 --> 01:20:02.391
Her who?

01:20:12.025 --> 01:20:13.358
He killed your wife.

01:20:16.488 --> 01:20:17.905
I'm so sorry we couldn't do more

01:20:18.071 --> 01:20:20.073
to catch the son of a bitch.

01:20:21.033 --> 01:20:23.911
We didn't make the connection until it was too late.

Ms. Mitchell,

01:20:29.876 --> 01:20:32.961
are you sure this was self-defense?

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.714
What are you trying to say?

01:20:34.881 --> 01:20:36.883
A serial killer breaks into my house

01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:38.926
and tries to kill me,

01:20:39.093 --> 01:20:41.971
then I used a gun of the cop he murdered on camera

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:43.471
to defend myself?

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:46.308
Does that sound premeditated to you?

01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:49.353
Do you know how ridiculous you sound right now?

01:20:50.604 --> 01:20:51.648
Listen,

01:20:52.856 --> 01:20:55.442
my daughter was nearly killed by the same monster

01:20:55.608 --> 01:20:57.320
who murdered my wife.

01:20:57.486 --> 01:21:00.697
I think it's safe to say the guy got what we deserved.

01:21:04.286 --> 01:21:07.163
[Greg] I'm happy to know that you're safe, Alexis.

01:21:09.457 --> 01:21:12.001
