07:00.976 --> 07:02.043
Good morning!

07:03.691 --> 07:06.158
Looks like we got us a nice day, huh?

07:09.356 --> 07:11.323
Are you, by any chance,
the welcoming committee?

07:11.843 --> 07:12.876
I ain't no committee.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.827
Still, it was nice of you to get
up so early and come down here.

07:16.149 --> 07:17.482
I always gets up early.

07:17.494 --> 07:19.894
Me, too. I'm afraid
I'll miss somethin'.

07:21.088 --> 07:22.688
I guess I oughta
introduce myself.

07:23.195 --> 07:24.128
I knows who you are.

07:25.267 --> 07:28.000
Okay.
Think it's gonna rain?

07:28.641 --> 07:29.808
Don't rain much this time of year.

07:31.496 --> 07:33.830
Well, I'm beginning to
run out of pleasantries.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.670
So if you'll just point me
in the direction to town...

07:49.814 --> 07:50.814
Good morning!

07:51.996 --> 07:52.996
Good morning.

07:54.742 --> 07:58.142
- I'm the new schoolteacher.
- Your hair is pretty long.

07:59.054 --> 08:03.154
- I'm a let it grow 'til the war's over.
- It's liable to reach your ass, son.

08:03.419 --> 08:05.452
Let's hope not.
Which way is the school, mister?

08:05.769 --> 08:07.802
If you're here to teach,
I reckon you can read.

08:51.588 --> 08:53.088
Welcome to Yamacraw Island.

08:54.445 --> 08:55.678
Welcome overseas.

08:56.346 --> 08:57.913
Thank you, ma'am.
It's great to be here.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.460
Don't speak too quickly.

09:00.195 --> 09:02.162
You're in a snake pit, son.

09:02.177 --> 09:04.944
And them snakes are gonna
start snappin' at your toes.

09:05.393 --> 09:07.260
I'm Mrs. Scott.
I'm the principal.

09:08.236 --> 09:11.503
- Pat Conroy.
- Do you mind working for a woman?

09:11.866 --> 09:14.666
No, ma'am. My father did it before
me and his father before him.

09:15.286 --> 09:17.419
Do you mind working
for a black woman?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm here.

09:22.888 --> 09:25.621
Treat your babies stern,
treat 'em tough.

09:26.593 --> 09:30.793
Step on 'em. Step on 'em every
day when they get out of line.

09:30.817 --> 09:33.617
Put your foot on them
and keep it there.

09:34.812 --> 09:36.945
I know colored people
better than you do.

09:38.493 --> 09:42.293
If you have any trouble,
Mama Scott will be right next door.

09:43.186 --> 09:44.186
I'll holler.

09:46.605 --> 09:49.705
Here are the babies now.
Yours is the fifth grade to eighth.

11:53.265 --> 11:56.198
- Good morning, babies.
- Good morning.

11:57.123 --> 12:01.123
Uh, babies.
I know you got vocal cords.

12:01.139 --> 12:02.405
Let me hear you use 'em.

12:02.467 --> 12:05.467
Let me hear you say, "Good
morning", like you mean it.

12:05.794 --> 12:06.994
Good morning!

12:11.686 --> 12:15.686
Most of you are slow.
All of us know that.

12:15.793 --> 12:16.793
You don't think good.

12:18.063 --> 12:21.463
That's because you're just lazy.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.067
Lazy.
Lazy!

12:25.107 --> 12:28.474
And lazy people
can't get ahead in life.

12:28.808 --> 12:31.908
But you can learn if you work.

12:32.556 --> 12:36.089
Work, work, work,
work, work!

12:39.443 --> 12:44.076
I now have the privilege of
introducing Mr. Patroy to the class.

12:45.534 --> 12:49.834
Mr. Patroy is so good to
come over here this spring

12:50.580 --> 12:53.180
and take the place
of our Mrs. Frost

12:53.450 --> 12:57.116
who's gone to have her
gall bladder taken out.

12:58.713 --> 13:02.680
We are thankful that the Lord
brought Mr. Patroy to us.

13:09.898 --> 13:11.998
That's enough!
Now, I don't wanna hear no more!

13:12.218 --> 13:13.218
I said, quiet!

13:18.186 --> 13:21.519
I'm now going to turn you
babies over to Mr. Patroy.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.011
You're his

13:25.556 --> 13:26.556
and he's yours.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.275
I want y'all to take a
real long look at me.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.291
That shouldnâ€™t be any hardship

13:47.315 --> 13:48.649
'cause I'm handsome.

13:53.355 --> 13:54.355
Huh.

13:54.953 --> 13:58.286
A thousand years of Irish inbreeding
have produced these fine features.

13:58.764 --> 14:01.664
This pug nose,
this pugnacious jaw.

14:02.907 --> 14:07.107
Moreover, I have a penetrating wit,
a fanciful imagination,

14:07.155 --> 14:09.055
and my eyes are almost
as blue as Paul Newman's.

14:09.445 --> 14:10.945
I am your teacher!

14:11.108 --> 14:13.208
- He crazy.
- Crazy.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.186
As a loon.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.419
- What're you talkin' about?
- What're you sayin'?

14:17.805 --> 14:18.705
Never mind.

14:19.447 --> 14:21.247
Haul your chairs up
around me right over here.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.590
Just set 'em up around me here.

14:24.158 --> 14:25.491
Here, I'll get that for you.

14:28.081 --> 14:29.081
Let's get close.

14:29.907 --> 14:31.240
Everybody move, now. C'mon.

14:32.015 --> 14:34.549
Get as close as you can.
Hey, what're you talkin' about?

14:35.631 --> 14:36.631
That's good.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.457
You wanna sit on
that table there?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.586
Young man, go ahead.

14:45.421 --> 14:46.421
That's better.

14:47.062 --> 14:48.328
Let's start with my name.

14:48.334 --> 14:50.468
Various people are screwin' it up.
It's a swell name.

14:50.500 --> 14:55.000
It belonged to a bartender, a minister,
a classic scholar, and a Burlesque queen.

14:55.357 --> 14:56.357
It's Conroy.

14:56.837 --> 14:59.370
Not Patroy. Pat Conroy.
Let me hear it!

15:06.159 --> 15:07.159
You!

15:08.408 --> 15:09.874
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

15:11.269 --> 15:14.769
Con...rack.

15:15.386 --> 15:16.286
What?

15:16.648 --> 15:19.348
Con...rack.

15:19.749 --> 15:22.149
Close, but not close enough.
Conroy!

15:22.766 --> 15:24.899
Boy, ploy, toy, joy.

15:25.918 --> 15:26.918
You try.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.020
Con...rack.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.399
Take a big bite out of it.
Try to get your mouth around it.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.032
Pretend you got a tennis
ball stuck in there.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.200
Oy.
Conroy.

15:42.595 --> 15:43.628
C'mon, everybody try it.

15:43.778 --> 15:47.878
Oy, oy. C'mon.
Oy, oy.

15:48.193 --> 15:51.593
Oy.
Oy, oy.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.440
Oy.
All right, you try it.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.172
Con...

15:59.577 --> 16:00.577
...rack.

16:01.738 --> 16:04.971
You know somethin'?
I'm beginning to like the sound of it.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.227
What country do we live in, gang?
Everybody tell me at once.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.575
Gang?

16:24.823 --> 16:27.523
What is the name of this grand old
red, white and blue country of ours?

16:28.631 --> 16:31.998
The place where we live, land of the
free and the home of the brave?

16:39.580 --> 16:41.580
Does anyone know what
country we live in?

16:51.859 --> 16:53.626
Honey, how much is two and two?

17:20.904 --> 17:22.471
How many fingers have
I got raised up here?

17:27.777 --> 17:28.777
Eight?

17:30.146 --> 17:32.013
You only missed it by two.
Try again.

17:36.747 --> 17:37.747
Two?

17:38.202 --> 17:41.602
I'll tell you what. Start at this first
finger and count to the last one.

17:48.327 --> 17:49.327
Five.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.612
Mrs. Scott!

18:01.642 --> 18:03.775
I just now completed my
first day in your school.

18:04.672 --> 18:06.405
The hair on the back of
my neck is standing up.

18:06.465 --> 18:09.765
Mrs. Scott, seven of my students
cannot recite the alphabet.

18:10.127 --> 18:11.693
Three children cannot
spell their names.

18:11.751 --> 18:16.051
Eighteen children do not know we're
fighting a war in Southeast Asia!

18:17.366 --> 18:18.599
Eighteen children never heard of Asia.

18:18.688 --> 18:21.188
One child thinks the Earth is flat.
The seventeen others agreed with him.

18:21.925 --> 18:24.725
Two children don't know how old they are,
five children don't know their birthdays.

18:24.764 --> 18:28.130
Four children can't count to ten.
The four oldest in the class

18:28.293 --> 18:30.993
think the Civil War was fought
between the Germans and the Japanese!

18:31.387 --> 18:34.987
None of them know who Willie Mays or
George Washington or Sidney Poitier is.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.617
Not one of them's ever been to a movie or stood
on top of the hill or ridden on a city bus.

18:38.637 --> 18:40.437
Those kids don't know crap!

18:42.158 --> 18:44.691
Remember what I told you
about colored children?

18:45.484 --> 18:49.151
They are slow. They need the whip.
They understand the whip.

18:50.859 --> 18:52.892
We're off the old plantation, Mrs. Scott.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.477
And I'll be goddamned if you're
gonna turn me into an overseer.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.804
How's it goin' today?
Caught any big ones?

19:17.058 --> 19:19.058
You've gotta stick with it.

19:30.856 --> 19:32.590
You the new schoolteacher?

19:38.445 --> 19:39.445
Yes, ma'am.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.329
- I'm the midwife over here.
- Oh.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.734
All these children on
this island my children.

19:47.518 --> 19:51.918
I take 'em out of their mothers.
I see 'em when they first be born.

19:52.319 --> 19:53.919
I bring 'em into this Earth.

19:54.949 --> 19:57.749
- Now you got 'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:58.090 --> 20:00.557
Treat 'em right,
and they'll do good for you.

20:02.153 --> 20:06.086
- Yes, ma'am.
- Treat 'em right, and they'll do good for you.

20:35.325 --> 20:36.325
Hey!

20:48.884 --> 20:49.884
Hey!

20:50.573 --> 20:51.573
Huh!

20:53.039 --> 20:54.039
Sit down.

21:29.082 --> 21:30.082
Top Cat Jones!

21:30.359 --> 21:31.726
Are you out of your mind?

21:31.727 --> 21:34.627
Are you darin' to lift a finger
and lay it on our Mr. Patroy?

21:34.634 --> 21:36.134
Conroy, goddammit!

21:36.696 --> 21:37.696
Conrack hurts!

21:40.118 --> 21:45.218
It wa- It wasn't him. It was me.
I felt like a little wrestling this morning.

21:45.557 --> 21:49.490
Mr. Patroy, you have already lost
the respect of these children.

21:49.531 --> 21:53.831
You have lowered yourself in their eyes.
They need discipline, not fun time.

21:53.889 --> 21:58.156
- This school isn't any fun time, you know?
- I'm enjoying myself.

21:58.344 --> 22:01.244
Well, you take Dr. Medicine
here and you give that boy a dose.

22:01.474 --> 22:02.974
A good one,
one he'll remember.

22:03.171 --> 22:05.737
You got to remember we are
overseas, Mr. Patroy.

22:05.944 --> 22:07.644
And things are tough overseas!

22:23.135 --> 22:24.902
Okay, gang, everybody sit down.

22:29.376 --> 22:30.709
Y'all listen up now.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.892
That little horseplay was designed
to get those old eyelids open,

22:33.910 --> 22:36.110
get your blood pressure up,
get that gray matter perkin'.

22:46.262 --> 22:47.262
Today

22:48.447 --> 22:49.447
we're gonna have a filibuster.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.993
That's somethin' we do very
well here in the South.

22:51.109 --> 22:53.209
It means a talkathon.
I'm gonna talk, and you're gonna listen.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.747
Anybody has to go pee, do it now,
'cause we're gonna be at it all day.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.067
All right.

23:03.910 --> 23:06.777
I was born in Beaufort, South Carolina,
where I grew up and went to school.

23:06.812 --> 23:08.112
I was a bigoted little boy.

23:08.350 --> 23:11.616
Bigot, that's somebody with
a red neck and a small brain.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.940
And I went to an all-white,
male military college

23:15.012 --> 23:17.412
where I wore a uniform even
when I went to the latrine.

23:18.296 --> 23:19.496
That's the toilet.

23:21.241 --> 23:24.741
I ate a lotta grits,
smelled a lotta magnolias in my time.

23:25.943 --> 23:28.743
I went to the movies twice a week.
My favorite actor was Humphrey Bogart.

23:29.042 --> 23:32.109
He was my favorite 'cause he
never took any shit from anybody.

23:36.674 --> 23:38.074
I learned about books

23:39.459 --> 23:42.559
from the third baseman on my college
baseball team who read Milton.

23:43.445 --> 23:44.945
And I learned about sex

23:45.785 --> 23:47.652
from the girl next door to my house

23:47.860 --> 23:49.460
who read Havelock Ellis.

23:51.438 --> 23:53.438
I'm gonna be readin'
both of them to you.

23:55.858 --> 23:59.358
I drive a small yellow car called a Volkswagen,
manufactured in a country called Germany

23:59.826 --> 24:01.759
on a continent called Europe.

24:02.322 --> 24:05.355
I write bad poetry, I write great
letters to newspaper editors.

24:05.410 --> 24:08.710
I'm a hypochondriac, that's somebody who's
afraid he's dyin' every time he sneezes.

24:08.766 --> 24:11.966
I believe in love of all kinds.
Carnal, platonic,

24:12.377 --> 24:13.377
fraternal,

24:13.874 --> 24:14.874
maternal,

24:15.609 --> 24:16.609
religious.

24:20.339 --> 24:21.339
Goofin' off?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.628
Just gettin' my supper.

24:25.151 --> 24:26.351
How'd you like to get mine?

24:27.078 --> 24:28.078
What you mean?

24:28.361 --> 24:30.694
I need somebody to cook for me,
do the dishes, wash my clothes.

24:30.779 --> 24:32.779
I need a little lookin' after.

24:32.946 --> 24:35.979
- How much you gonna pay?
- How much you want?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.143
A dollar.

24:38.385 --> 24:41.485
- A week?
- No, man. A day.

24:42.622 --> 24:45.222
I guess I can afford that,
if I cut down on my beer.

24:46.143 --> 24:49.143
- All right, I'll give you a try.
- I take home the leftovers?

24:49.284 --> 24:51.884
If you're a good cook,
there won't be any.

25:11.382 --> 25:13.682
- You awake?
- I is now.

25:14.972 --> 25:18.838
- What did you eat for breakfast?
- Piece o' bread, Coca-Cola.

25:19.579 --> 25:23.379
Tomorrow, eat an egg. Eat two.
Protein gives you a slug of energy.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.690
I want everybody here slugged.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.024
What's all that racket?

25:29.079 --> 25:31.212
Reveille, Mrs. Scott.
Just a small reveille.

25:35.163 --> 25:36.313
Okay, gang.

25:36.338 --> 25:39.687
I'd like to have a word with your
babies, Mr. Patroy.

25:43.282 --> 25:44.282
Last night

25:45.576 --> 25:49.176
I found a puddle on one
of the seats in here.

25:50.666 --> 25:55.999
Now, babies, everybody has got to u-ri-nate.
Isn't that right?

25:56.533 --> 26:00.033
And ain't nothing wrong
with a man urinating.

26:01.858 --> 26:05.058
But you could ruin a
seat by urinating on it.

26:06.832 --> 26:10.566
All of us know that urine
is made out of ...?

26:11.243 --> 26:12.243
Acid.

26:13.328 --> 26:16.628
And acid can eat
right through a chair.

26:19.807 --> 26:21.707
There's plenty of weak
bladders in the world.

26:21.806 --> 26:27.706
The bladder is just like a muscle.
Some weak, some strong.

26:29.021 --> 26:35.147
Now, whoever that person is who wet the
chair, and he knows who he is,

26:36.135 --> 26:38.935
should stand up now and say,
"Mrs. Scott,

26:39.697 --> 26:42.731
I have a weak bladder,
and I am very sorry."

26:46.475 --> 26:48.808
Mrs. Scott, I have a weak
bladder, and I'm very sorry.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.860
Okay. A-all right. A-all right.

26:55.453 --> 26:56.453
What are you talking about?

26:57.319 --> 26:59.485
I was the last person sittin'
in that chair yesterday.

27:01.423 --> 27:05.156
Mr. Patroy, I got a right
side, and I got a wrong side.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.774
And you are getting
on the wrong one.

27:12.216 --> 27:13.216
Okay, gang.

27:13.911 --> 27:17.078
Everybody's gonna look good today,
everybody's gonna shine like the sun.

27:17.988 --> 27:20.721
Ronny, in your opinion,
who is the greatest man who ever lived?

27:23.124 --> 27:24.124
Jesus.

27:24.581 --> 27:26.181
All right, I'll buy that.
Now, somebody else.

27:26.893 --> 27:28.226
Who's the second greatest?

27:29.142 --> 27:30.142
Jesus Christ.

27:31.504 --> 27:34.171
They're one and the same,
Debbie, Jesus and Jesus Christ.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.553
Anybody wanna say a good
word for Moses or Buddha?

27:37.571 --> 27:39.471
- No!
- No? Okay.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.285
Let's go on.

27:41.674 --> 27:42.840
Who can name me an ocean?

27:44.028 --> 27:45.161
I'm gonna give you a hint:

27:45.251 --> 27:47.217
One of the oceans of the
world washes right up against

27:47.242 --> 27:49.708
the shores of our own
scenic Yamacraw Island.

27:49.962 --> 27:51.429
Oh, he mean the beach!

27:51.569 --> 27:54.469
What's beyond the beach? What's the name
given to that whole ocean out there?

27:54.822 --> 27:56.089
It's just the beach, man.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.680
Okay, it's the beach.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.609
But just for the record,
it's also called the Atlantic Ocean.

28:02.888 --> 28:05.788
- Have you ever heard it called that?
- No, we ain't, Conrack.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.552
Well, don't worry about it.
That kinda stuff is easy to learn.

28:08.768 --> 28:11.501
Just by rappin' about it,
we'll learn which ocean is off Yamacraw.

28:13.503 --> 28:16.536
All right. Veola!
What is the name of the ocean?

28:16.817 --> 28:17.817
Lantic Ocean.

28:17.847 --> 28:20.047
- Atlantic Ocean.
- Atlantic Ocean.

28:20.122 --> 28:23.022
- What ocean, everybody?
- Atlantic Ocean!

28:23.063 --> 28:26.863
- Are you sure it's the Atlantic Ocean?
- Yeah, we sure.

28:26.935 --> 28:29.402
Well, it's not. The real name of
the ocean is the Conroy Ocean.

28:29.482 --> 28:31.482
Oh, no.

28:32.069 --> 28:33.869
Yeah! Yeah, it's the truth!

28:34.761 --> 28:38.321
My great-great grandfather was Ferdinand
Conroy, a Spanish soldier of fortune

28:38.346 --> 28:42.185
who swam from Europe to North America,
a distance of fifteen million miles.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.839
Because of this singular and
extraordinary feat, from that day forward,

28:45.867 --> 28:47.534
it's been called the Conroy Ocean.

28:48.555 --> 28:50.555
- No.
- How do you know?

28:51.033 --> 28:53.166
Just think.
You said it was the Atlantic.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.166
- I'm a liar.
- Can't be. You's a teacher.

28:58.810 --> 29:01.743
Teachers lie all the time.

29:09.882 --> 29:10.882
All right now.

29:11.944 --> 29:13.744
The Lotus position of Yoga.

29:14.577 --> 29:19.177
Yoga is a discipline aimed at the
state of perfect spiritual insight

29:19.511 --> 29:20.511
and tranquility.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.207
- Lord, look at him.
- Hey!

29:22.723 --> 29:25.756
It's said to clear the mind

29:27.595 --> 29:30.228
and drain... drain the sinus.

29:41.794 --> 29:47.694
Gravity. A law first stated by Isaac Newton
and elaborated on by Johannes Kepler.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.883
- Isaac Newton!
- Isaac Newton!

29:49.978 --> 29:52.612
- Johannes Kepler!
- Johannes Kepler!

29:52.716 --> 29:54.183
- Gravity!
- Gravity!

29:54.575 --> 29:57.042
- Isaac Gravity!
- Isaac Gravity!

29:58.130 --> 29:59.130
All right now.

29:59.314 --> 30:03.614
Everybody brush down from the gum.
Down... down from the gum.

30:03.983 --> 30:07.916
Now up... up from the bottom,
up from the gum, from the bottom.

30:08.725 --> 30:10.858
Good. And now everybody...
spit!

30:12.940 --> 30:14.640
Try not to spit on the teacher!

30:24.682 --> 30:26.416
These are the worst biscuits I ever ate.

30:27.613 --> 30:29.013
And I've been in the army!

30:29.645 --> 30:31.112
You don't like 'em, don't eat 'em.

30:31.893 --> 30:33.993
- What's in 'em?
- Done my own recipe.

30:34.724 --> 30:37.124
So have I.
Come on in here.

30:46.432 --> 30:47.432
Here.

30:48.967 --> 30:52.700
- I don't cook fancy.
- You don't read fancy, either, do you?

30:53.159 --> 30:55.225
All right.
This word is "cup."

30:55.982 --> 30:57.315
"Two cups of flour."

30:57.651 --> 31:00.284
This word is "teaspoon".
One teaspoon of baking powder.

31:00.876 --> 31:03.076
This word is "pound".
A quarter pound of shortenin'.

31:11.908 --> 31:13.241
Which word is "cup"?

31:19.425 --> 31:20.758
I wanna talk to you!

31:22.982 --> 31:25.682
You're standin' between me and my
pants, Mrs. Scott!

31:44.580 --> 31:46.613
Salt water is good
for my mosquito bites.

31:47.187 --> 31:48.220
Mr. Patroy.

31:50.131 --> 31:52.564
We've got young
girls on this island.

31:52.831 --> 31:56.031
Oh, you can't go scamperin'
around without your pants on.

31:56.121 --> 31:59.854
- This ain't the Garden of Eden.
- Sure ain't, Mrs. Scott.

32:00.318 --> 32:06.285
I can't allow a white boy and my colored
girls to go rubbin' elbows too much.

32:07.332 --> 32:12.132
You're a young bull, Mr. Patroy, with no
cows on this island except colored cows.

32:12.892 --> 32:16.192
But I can't afford to have no
half-breed cows on this island.

32:16.238 --> 32:19.638
Please don't feel any anxiety, ma'am.
I was raised in the utmost strictness.

32:19.988 --> 32:23.288
Besides, I'm shacked up with
a young actress in Beaufort.

32:24.209 --> 32:26.509
I'm not an old maid, Mr. Patroy.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.220
I was married once,
for twelve years.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.691
He was a good little man.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.535
A good little man,
I have to say so.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.774
And after he died,
his brother wanted to marry me, too.

32:45.725 --> 32:47.825
Put baking soda on your bites.

32:53.362 --> 32:58.295
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying"

32:58.727 --> 33:03.627
"And this same flower that smiles today
To-morrow will be dying."

33:04.588 --> 33:05.588
Robert Herrick.

33:06.292 --> 33:08.625
Pretty good country poet.
English.

33:10.048 --> 33:11.081
Here we got

33:12.193 --> 33:13.527
Sultana. Right here.

33:14.838 --> 33:15.838
What's this one?

33:17.749 --> 33:21.215
- Foxfire!
- Foxfire.

33:21.621 --> 33:22.655
How about this here?

33:23.366 --> 33:25.733
- Baby's breath.
- Right. Baby's breath.

33:26.769 --> 33:27.769
This one?

33:29.593 --> 33:31.193
Queen Anne's lace.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.577
Queen Anne's lace.

33:34.094 --> 33:38.694
"When gardens only had their towers,
And all the garrisons were flowers"

33:39.258 --> 33:45.325
"When roses only arms might bear,
And men did rosy garlands wear?"

33:45.533 --> 33:49.500
That means they were all flower children.
They had time write pretty words like that.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.651
Who wrote that one down, Conrack?

33:52.332 --> 33:56.932
Andrew Marvell.
Born 1621, died in 1678.

33:58.026 --> 34:01.293
- What's this one?
- That's Everlasting.

34:01.901 --> 34:04.434
Why'd they call it that?
Do it last forever?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.534
Forever and ever. Amen.

34:08.112 --> 34:10.379
Everlasting.
I'll keep it and see.

34:14.254 --> 34:16.187
Get off my land, white folks!

34:18.458 --> 34:20.558
Actually, we're mostly black, mister.

34:20.797 --> 34:24.098
Did you hear what I said?
I said, clear off my land, now!

34:24.123 --> 34:27.456
We're just pickin' a few wildflowers
here, no harm... Ugh!

34:40.358 --> 34:42.858
- Who the hell was that?
- That's Mad Billy.

34:43.384 --> 34:44.451
What's he mad about?

34:44.504 --> 34:47.837
- His wife died on him.
- Yeah, Sookie take the crook and die.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.820
Her ghost come around and carry
on every night to spook him.

34:51.518 --> 34:55.118
Oh God. I so scared,
I wouldn't want no ghost to get me.

34:55.141 --> 34:57.141
Me, neither.
Let's get outta here. C'mon.

34:57.992 --> 34:58.992
- Conrack?
- Yeah.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.220
Come on, let's go!

35:10.386 --> 35:11.586
Well, hello there!

35:13.647 --> 35:16.547
I just brought your lunch.
Forgot it.

35:18.353 --> 35:20.253
Stick around.
See what's goin' on.

35:20.308 --> 35:21.808
Take a seat there,
next to your little brother.

35:23.656 --> 35:26.023
I ain't sittin' next to him.
He don't never take no bath.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.284
Sit next to me.
I do.

35:31.376 --> 35:32.643
I got things to do.

35:33.781 --> 35:35.114
We're talkin' about the human body.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.957
You got one. Why not hang around
and find out how it works?

35:39.600 --> 35:41.567
So here we have nature
at the top of her form.

35:42.692 --> 35:46.392
Efficient, awe-inspiring,
the source of a lot of human happiness.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.728
This is what the uterus
looks like, sort of.

35:50.561 --> 35:52.561
It receives and holds
a fertilized ovum.

35:53.126 --> 35:55.359
I don't believe I'm doin' justice to
what is probably the greatest design

35:55.408 --> 35:56.508
since the rotary engine.

36:08.977 --> 36:10.710
Why can't I get you in
school and keep you there?

36:11.086 --> 36:12.786
Why are you the toughest
nut I got to crack?

36:13.010 --> 36:14.777
Cause I hates her, that's why.

36:15.057 --> 36:16.057
Mrs. Scott is not your
teacher, I am.

36:17.127 --> 36:19.627
Well, a teacher oughta act like
she likes you even if she don't.

36:19.793 --> 36:21.693
She shouldn't go round
knockin' you on your head

36:21.744 --> 36:24.644
and talkin' back atcha in front of
folks tryin' to make you look small.

36:25.629 --> 36:29.262
God made all of us. He ain't made
a few and somebody else made some.

36:29.324 --> 36:30.791
No, he made all of us!

36:37.870 --> 36:39.537
All right, get away from that window!

36:46.365 --> 36:47.565
So very nice!

36:48.237 --> 36:49.437
So very nice!

36:50.194 --> 36:51.994
So pleased to make your acquaintance.

36:52.844 --> 36:58.044
I'm so pleased to tell you that the chillun
seem to think you are a fine gentleman.

36:58.364 --> 36:59.497
A fine gentleman.

37:00.039 --> 37:01.239
So very nice.

37:01.437 --> 37:04.071
- So pleased to make your acquaintance.
- Same here.

37:04.373 --> 37:05.873
The name's Quickfellow.

37:06.628 --> 37:09.128
I believe there'll be a storm.

37:10.437 --> 37:14.337
Temperature: 93 degrees
and slightly falling.

37:14.961 --> 37:18.527
Relative humidity: 87% and rising.

37:19.363 --> 37:22.063
Scattered thundershowers
early this evening.

37:22.706 --> 37:25.473
Winds out of the East
at 15 miles an hour.

37:26.748 --> 37:29.415
Small boat warnings
out for small boats.

37:29.447 --> 37:32.847
Big boats okay.
Don't have to worry about nutting.

37:36.744 --> 37:41.744
"Lift every voice and sing
'Til earth and heaven ring"

37:42.001 --> 37:47.101
"Ring with the
harmony of Liberty"

37:47.208 --> 37:53.941
"Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies"

37:53.995 --> 37:58.895
"Let it resound loud
as the rolling sea"

37:58.951 --> 38:05.418
"Sing a song full of the faith
that the dark past has taught us"

38:05.453 --> 38:12.753
"Sing a song full of the hope
that the present has brought us"

38:13.225 --> 38:16.792
"Facing the rising sun"

38:17.200 --> 38:18.467
"Of our new day..."

38:19.431 --> 38:21.597
Better late than never.
Take a chair.

38:22.545 --> 38:23.945
Hey, where ya goin'?
Wait a minute.

38:24.229 --> 38:26.996
I comin' into school,
everybody's got shoes on 'cept me.

38:27.068 --> 38:28.701
I think that's trashy,
goin' round barefooted.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.673
All right, everybody
peel outta their shoes!

38:32.360 --> 38:37.960
Let's liberate our bunions, let's aerate our
corns and calluses, let's wiggle our toes!

38:43.369 --> 38:45.202
Wiggle your toes!
C'mon, lemme see 'em.

38:45.434 --> 38:46.534
Lemme see those toes!

38:47.181 --> 38:48.847
Come on, get on that table
and wiggle those toes!

38:50.892 --> 38:51.959
C'mon, Ronnie, get up!

38:52.795 --> 38:53.862
How many toes you got?

38:54.128 --> 38:55.628
- Mac Arthur!
- Ten toes.

38:56.853 --> 38:58.353
Wiggle 'em! Wiggle them toes!

39:24.077 --> 39:26.077
Where's your half of the rent?
Hm?

39:30.067 --> 39:32.601
We have the pleasure today of
a visit from Mr. Skeffington.

39:32.859 --> 39:35.059
Come all the way from the mainland
to spend some time with us.

39:35.241 --> 39:39.108
Mr. Skeffington breathes the
pure air of Mount Parnassus.

39:39.343 --> 39:40.910
He's our school superintendent.

39:41.147 --> 39:44.447
He hires and fires,
tells the Board of Education what's what

39:44.534 --> 39:46.934
and reminds teachers of the
nobility of their calling.

39:46.948 --> 39:47.948
He's my boss.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.638
For God's sake, do good.

39:51.736 --> 39:53.736
All right.
Up here.

40:01.335 --> 40:03.135
Rosemary!
What is this?

40:07.261 --> 40:08.727
I don't know, Conrack.

40:09.704 --> 40:11.104
That's a pyramid, Rosemary.

40:11.907 --> 40:14.774
They used to bury kings in those
things thousands of years ago.

40:15.356 --> 40:17.089
In a country called Egypt.

40:19.953 --> 40:21.753
All right, John!
Who is this?

40:24.680 --> 40:26.147
I don't know, Conrack.

40:27.252 --> 40:30.319
You guys are gonna put me
in the unemployment line.

40:31.109 --> 40:33.809
That's Babe Ruth, one of the greatest
ball players that ever lived.

40:34.229 --> 40:37.216
He used to play for the New York
Yankees, he hit 714 home runs

40:37.241 --> 40:39.486
in his career, more than anybody
in the history of baseball.

40:39.755 --> 40:40.755
He playin' now?

40:41.536 --> 40:42.636
No, he's dead now.

40:42.930 --> 40:44.830
Yeah, stupid, he dead.

40:45.121 --> 40:46.121
That man live!

40:46.876 --> 40:48.276
Johnny think that man live!

41:07.099 --> 41:09.432
Shut your yaps and listen to me!

41:14.959 --> 41:18.259
There ain't gonna be no more fights
in Yamacraw Elementary School.

41:20.543 --> 41:21.543
Why?

41:23.517 --> 41:24.551
I'm gonna tell you why.

41:24.835 --> 41:30.135
Cause I got a method that can render
Samson hairless and Goliath helpless.

41:31.753 --> 41:33.220
I'm now gonna demonstrate.

41:37.150 --> 41:39.650
This is called "milkin' the rat".

41:40.848 --> 41:44.681
You press the fingernail of your
opponent's finger with your thumb.

41:45.211 --> 41:48.608
Your index finger squeezes the back
of the top joint of his finger.

41:49.233 --> 41:54.935
Your thumb mashes his fingernail,
causing considerable consternation and pain.

41:59.566 --> 42:02.099
Yes, sir.
"Milkin' the rat".

42:02.992 --> 42:07.892
Guaranteed to break up fights, rebellions
and mutinies in any classroom anywhere.

42:09.565 --> 42:10.765
Go on with your lesson, Pat.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.020
We're all listenin' now.

42:18.735 --> 42:24.535
In the light of that demonstration, it seems
appropriate to talk about Atilla the Hun.

42:37.178 --> 42:40.145
Where can we get ourselves a
nice, long, cold beer?

42:40.297 --> 42:42.597
We can get a short, warm,
dusty one at the grocery store.

42:45.779 --> 42:48.179
"Many of these people arrived
in Washington last night..."

42:48.199 --> 42:50.999
Look!
There's a bunch o' nans!

42:51.091 --> 42:53.391
And that's Dr. Spock! I recognize him.

42:53.593 --> 42:56.493
Look at those long-haired freaks.

42:57.306 --> 42:58.806
Can't tell if they're boys or girls.

42:59.940 --> 43:00.740
Look.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.946
Look at that hippie with the
flag sewed to his behind.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.364
Lice.

43:06.945 --> 43:09.445
All the others are lice.

43:10.799 --> 43:12.532
Huntley and Brinkley
are lice, too.

43:13.259 --> 43:15.259
They ain't supportin'
our boys in Vietnam.

43:15.339 --> 43:18.605
Naw, they're lice.
All communists, sure as hell.

43:19.819 --> 43:22.219
Look at those long-haired lice.

43:22.239 --> 43:24.739
I wouldn't give those lice a drink
of piss if they were dying of thirst.

43:30.675 --> 43:31.675
God Almighty!

43:33.195 --> 43:34.428
I think that's my own son!

43:35.821 --> 43:37.521
It is! He's right there,
with the beard!

43:40.807 --> 43:41.807
Yeah, he is.

43:44.489 --> 43:45.489
It's Ralphie.

43:48.175 --> 43:51.675
I suppose I sounded a little
overheated back there.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.147
Well, it's just that
I love this country.

43:55.838 --> 43:58.938
I love the glory of
Fort Sumter and Bull Run.

43:59.256 --> 44:00.256
I never in my...

44:01.015 --> 44:03.215
I never in my heart
accepted Appomatox.

44:03.985 --> 44:08.018
Dammit, Pat! Aren't the important
things order and control?

44:08.072 --> 44:10.172
Obedience and smooth sailin'?!

44:10.499 --> 44:12.966
Camelot is beleaguered,
Mr. Skeffington!

44:53.613 --> 44:54.813
Hey, I ain't gonna hurt you none!

44:56.468 --> 44:57.535
I ain't gonna give
you the chance.

44:57.691 --> 45:02.558
Aw, listen, I-I, like I was outta my
head last time. I'd hurt about my Libby.

45:03.790 --> 45:07.423
I heard about your wife.
I'm sorry.

45:10.934 --> 45:11.934
Well...

45:13.340 --> 45:15.873
She wasn't more than
twenty years old.

45:20.810 --> 45:21.710
You drink whiskey?

45:22.482 --> 45:23.482
If it's cheap enough.

45:24.334 --> 45:25.334
I makes it.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.291
I makes it, and I sells it.

45:27.626 --> 45:30.593
I sells it out of my shirt front
in these half-pint bottles.

45:31.101 --> 45:33.734
Oh, people rather see me
comin' than the milkman.

45:35.688 --> 45:36.755
You wanna taste?

45:43.518 --> 45:45.051
You that new
schoolteacher, ain't you?

45:46.258 --> 45:47.258
That's right.

45:54.449 --> 45:55.449
You know your business.

45:55.927 --> 45:59.260
You teach me to read 'n' write,
and I'll trade that whiskey for it.

46:03.485 --> 46:05.185
I makes it with that copper tubin'.

46:05.279 --> 46:07.879
That way your ass don't get
blind at drinkin' this stuff.

46:40.210 --> 46:44.410
I never seen anything so brutal,
so dangerous or so insane in my whole life!

46:45.074 --> 46:46.274
Goddammit, this is football!

46:46.982 --> 46:49.582
It's a game of rules,
fair play and sportsmanship!

46:49.825 --> 46:50.958
It is a noble game

46:51.173 --> 46:55.640
in which gentlemen and athletes
conduct themselves in a proper manner

46:55.733 --> 46:56.933
on a field of honor.

46:57.017 --> 46:59.017
It is a... ballet!

47:00.800 --> 47:04.700
A clash of wills, a test of strength!
It partakes of elegance,

47:05.771 --> 47:08.471
courage and discipline!
And that's the way we're gonna play it!

47:08.498 --> 47:10.464
Now, you mothers get your
knees out of each other's groins

47:10.589 --> 47:11.921
and your teeth out
of each other's butts

47:12.756 --> 47:13.756
and do what I tell ya!

47:14.431 --> 47:15.431
Huddle!

47:16.138 --> 47:19.638
All right. This is where you get the
words, like Moses comin' down from Sinai.

47:19.785 --> 47:22.018
It's holy writ, and nobody does
any talkin' but the quarterback.

47:22.557 --> 47:24.557
Okay.
Break! Hop! Go!

47:25.940 --> 47:27.640
You come at me,
do as good as you can!

47:28.161 --> 47:29.661
All right, you're the Maginot line!

47:30.672 --> 47:31.872
You're the Great Wall of China!

47:35.506 --> 47:36.706
You're a brick shithouse!

47:40.282 --> 47:42.382
Even if your crotch
itches, you don't scratch.

47:42.431 --> 47:44.731
Nobody moves 'til
the ball is snapped.

48:17.506 --> 48:18.873
That's it! It's over!
Gimme the ball!

48:19.441 --> 48:21.174
That's it.
It's over.

48:21.634 --> 48:23.134
You guys are unteachable!

49:04.019 --> 49:05.019
Hello.

49:05.644 --> 49:06.644
Sit down.

49:13.736 --> 49:16.603
I helped myself to some of your buttermilk.
This is the end of it.

49:17.349 --> 49:20.949
- Make yourself at home, sir.
- This visit ain't social.

49:21.384 --> 49:24.650
It's a pain in the ass.
Took me off the golf course.

49:25.248 --> 49:28.648
- Oh, what do you go a round in?
- Under 80. Never mind about that.

49:30.791 --> 49:34.891
I'm up at five,
I'm shaved at six,

49:34.964 --> 49:37.931
I'm at my desk at seven with
all my pencils sharpened.

49:38.429 --> 49:39.429
Why ain't you?

49:40.456 --> 49:43.256
- Who says I'm not?
- I've been informed.

49:45.154 --> 49:46.287
Who informed ya?

49:46.299 --> 49:49.099
Well, let's just say I've been
informed and leave it at that.

49:49.672 --> 49:52.172
No, just tell me who informed
ya and leave it at that.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.790
Are you late for
class or aren'tcha?

49:55.259 --> 49:59.925
I was once. My toilet overflowed, and I
spent the morning using the plunger on it.

50:00.461 --> 50:02.961
- Does it work now?
- No, it doesn't.

50:04.134 --> 50:06.234
Use some plumber's friend on
it, it'll open it right up.

50:06.569 --> 50:08.369
Thanks anyway, but I dug a slit trench.

50:10.184 --> 50:11.184
Oh.

50:16.301 --> 50:19.601
Heard you stuck a feather in your hair and
wahooped round your class.

50:20.570 --> 50:25.604
Heard you come in there barefoot.
Heard you drew private parts on the blackboard.

50:26.447 --> 50:27.680
You call that teachin'?

50:28.507 --> 50:31.173
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I don't. I call it fartin' around.

50:32.999 --> 50:35.199
Something's happening on this
island, Mr. Skeffington.

50:35.954 --> 50:39.287
And compared to that,
you're nothing, and neither am I.

50:50.730 --> 50:53.230
I don't wanna have to
come over here again, Pat.

50:58.229 --> 51:00.729
I get seasick making that crossin'.

51:08.170 --> 51:12.170
"A little red hen once"

51:12.897 --> 51:17.030
"f-f-found a grain of wheat."

51:18.247 --> 51:24.281
"'Who will plant this
wheat?' she asked."

51:24.303 --> 51:30.703
"'I won't,' said the dog.
'I won't,' said the cat."

51:31.583 --> 51:34.317
"'And I won't', said the pig."

51:35.024 --> 51:36.691
- Good.
- That right?

51:37.515 --> 51:39.315
You'll be readin'
Playboy by next week.

51:40.034 --> 51:42.134
And I sure hope it got
more to it than this.

51:43.358 --> 51:44.358
It has.

51:46.507 --> 51:49.807
- What you doin' here, Conrack?
- Fishin'.

51:50.177 --> 51:52.844
I know. I mean, what you
doin' here on this island?

51:53.323 --> 51:54.923
You the only white man here.

51:55.118 --> 51:57.618
I mean, except for Ryder,
he's only here 'cause his store is.

52:00.486 --> 52:01.486
Well, I'll tell ya.

52:04.662 --> 52:05.662
I used to

52:06.472 --> 52:09.539
chuck watermelons at black
kids, call them "niggerheads".

52:10.955 --> 52:12.888
Then I did a 180-degree turn,

52:13.583 --> 52:16.850
and if a black man handed me a bucket
of cow piss and told me to drink it,

52:17.716 --> 52:21.216
to rid my soul of the stench of
racism, I'd only ask him for a straw.

52:22.758 --> 52:24.958
Now I'm just teachin' school.

52:28.494 --> 52:29.494
Ugh!

52:30.867 --> 52:31.867
Mercy.

52:32.466 --> 52:35.266
- You ever been off this island?
- No.

52:36.906 --> 52:37.939
You ever wanna get off it?

52:39.632 --> 52:40.632
Nh-nh.

52:41.827 --> 52:43.227
You don't wanna see
the rest of the world?

52:44.013 --> 52:47.113
The porno pics, used-car lots,
Colonel Sanders' Kentucky Fried?

52:48.461 --> 52:49.461
No.

52:50.053 --> 52:54.253
I can get my shoelaces here.
Tobacco and combs and...

52:56.268 --> 52:58.468
linen and cheap candy.

52:59.602 --> 53:00.869
Shit, and now I can read.

53:05.007 --> 53:07.274
Look like you got somethin', huh?

53:38.180 --> 53:44.347
There ain't a family on this island that hasn't
pulled somebody - somebody - from that river.

53:45.444 --> 53:48.344
They fall in that river,
they go down, like a stone.

53:50.194 --> 53:53.461
Well, I can't swim neither.

53:54.277 --> 53:56.110
Ain't nobody 'round here can.

54:04.202 --> 54:06.402
Hell, what're you doin'?
I can't swim!

54:07.540 --> 54:09.540
You know, I could drown in that river?
Let me go!

54:09.932 --> 54:11.632
Fuckin' hell! Please help me!

54:11.712 --> 54:12.912
- You're goin' in that water.
- No!

54:12.979 --> 54:15.512
You're gonna kick your feet,
you're gonna pound your hands,

54:15.560 --> 54:17.360
you're gonna suck in air,
and you're gonna swim.

54:17.387 --> 54:20.020
- No!
- Okay. Hold your breath now!

54:21.993 --> 54:22.993
All right. C'mere.

54:24.497 --> 54:25.730
C'mon. Come towards me.

54:26.349 --> 54:29.149
Kick your feet. Kick your feet.
Now clap your hands.

54:29.243 --> 54:32.109
C'mon. You wanna sock me?
Come get me. C'mon.

54:33.043 --> 54:34.043
Okay.

54:35.306 --> 54:37.539
There. Wasn't that fun?

54:37.918 --> 54:39.484
You dirty son of a bitch!

54:42.254 --> 54:43.254
No profanity!

54:45.719 --> 54:46.852
Just proficiency.

54:47.450 --> 54:48.450
All right.

54:49.925 --> 54:50.925
Keep tryin'.

54:51.251 --> 54:53.051
Let's go. C'mon, everybody in!

54:53.485 --> 54:54.818
You can stand there.

54:56.225 --> 54:57.725
Okay. C'mon.
Come on in the water.

54:58.876 --> 55:01.209
Ronnie, come here.
Stay in that water.

55:02.321 --> 55:03.988
Mary, stay in that water.
C'mere.

55:23.484 --> 55:26.392
You reach out and you grab a
cup of water like that

55:26.417 --> 55:29.108
and push it back behind you and then
throw it out behind you like that.

55:30.106 --> 55:32.906
Throw it out behind you like that.
Then you reach with your other arm

55:33.988 --> 55:37.288
and grab another cup of water. See?
And push it out behind like that.

55:37.579 --> 55:39.245
Another cup of water. See?

55:45.954 --> 55:47.387
Yeah, that's good, pal.

55:53.604 --> 55:55.071
Kick your feet! C'mon!

55:56.690 --> 55:57.690
Attaboy, Mac.

55:58.703 --> 55:59.703
All right.

56:14.417 --> 56:19.617
"Black, black, black is the
color of my true love's hair"

56:21.134 --> 56:25.234
"Her lips like some rosy fair"

56:26.814 --> 56:33.314
"The prettiest face
and the neatest hands"

56:33.668 --> 56:37.168
"I love the ground
whereon she stands"

56:37.660 --> 56:43.660
"I love the ground
whereon she stands"

56:45.828 --> 56:48.828
Yo, man, you sing like a frog!

56:49.268 --> 56:52.068
Oh, that boy say Conrack
sing like a frog.

56:54.665 --> 56:56.332
No, I sing good.
What're you talkin' about?

56:56.650 --> 56:58.950
You sing so bad, Conrack,
man, you hurt my ear.

57:00.647 --> 57:04.114
- Everybody warm now?
- Yeah, we warm.

57:14.796 --> 57:15.796
Gang?

57:16.438 --> 57:18.238
If you think you're rid of me
for the summer, you're not.

57:18.346 --> 57:20.046
Summer school starts
Monday morning.

57:21.393 --> 57:22.760
How many of you
are gonna show up?

57:24.930 --> 57:27.197
Only three, huh?
Okay.

57:28.406 --> 57:31.006
I believe in democracy.
We're gonna vote again.

57:31.267 --> 57:33.767
However, any arm I will see raised in
the air this time is gonna get broken.

57:34.304 --> 57:36.504
Now, how many of you
come to summer school?

57:37.979 --> 57:40.735
Excellent.
That is unanimous, and I must say,

57:40.760 --> 57:45.602
it's extremely gratifyin' for me to find that
my students share my enthusiasm for learning.

57:48.212 --> 57:51.112
This hunk o' orange on the
map is the country of Brazil.

57:51.936 --> 57:56.736
Now, what bright, young scholar can tell
me what product we drink from Brazil?

58:00.627 --> 58:04.194
Some people drink it black,
some people drink it with cream.

58:04.907 --> 58:08.974
Some people drink it with sugar,
and some people...

58:10.087 --> 58:13.254
don't drink it at all.

58:15.348 --> 58:16.348
Coke!

58:44.244 --> 58:46.544
Mr. Patroy!
Mr. Patroy!

58:48.296 --> 58:49.296
Where are you?

58:50.022 --> 58:53.022
Right over here, Mrs. Scott.
Eatin' popcorn.

58:53.441 --> 58:54.441
What's happenin' in here?

58:55.192 --> 58:59.725
Well, Mr. George Sanders is just about to
be run through the gut by Mr. Tyrone Power.

59:01.551 --> 59:03.251
Where'd you find
all this equipment?

59:04.090 --> 59:05.823
In the back of a
closet, getting dusty.

59:06.299 --> 59:10.466
I don't hold with machine education,
Mr. Patroy. You're wasting valuable time.

59:10.565 --> 59:15.165
Your job is to see that these children
learn their lessons and do their duty.

59:15.984 --> 59:18.751
The smell in here would drive
a preacher outta church.

59:19.212 --> 59:24.312
Smellin' bad in school will not be tolerated.
I'm tired of people stinking in this school.

59:24.522 --> 59:27.322
Mrs. Scott, your tact is only
exceeded by your delicacy.

59:27.417 --> 59:29.317
We thank you for makin' us
all aware of our armpits

59:29.343 --> 59:32.077
and now, if you don't mind,
we'd like to see how the movie ends.

59:32.541 --> 59:37.175
Just remember that I'm the principal here,
Mr. Patroy. I'm the principal.

59:46.970 --> 59:49.470
She ain't got no right
to say things like that.

59:49.487 --> 59:50.487
She sure don't.

59:52.694 --> 59:55.727
- Don't listen.
- She ain't talkin' 'bout you.

59:57.876 --> 59:59.009
Good point.

01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:03.736
But I don't like to see you get your
feelings hurt, believe me. It pisses me off.

01:00:04.522 --> 01:00:07.722
- Bitch woman.
- Yeah, bitch woman.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.500
How about you call me
"bitch man" behind my back?

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:13.846
No, Conrack.

01:00:37.773 --> 01:00:40.306
Who are you?
I got a gun pointed at your head.

01:00:40.749 --> 01:00:42.549
It's me, Conroy! Goddammit!

01:00:42.659 --> 01:00:45.926
I keep fire handy all the
time, Mr. Patroy.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.440
Never know who's gonna come
up to your house at night.

01:00:48.798 --> 01:00:51.098
And if you're smart,
you get some fire, too.

01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.881
I'd rather have a cup of coffee, Mrs. Scott.

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:10.862
- You make these with molasses?
- Yes.

01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:14.778
And a pinch of cinammon
and a pinch of nutmeg.

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.674
I use a little ginger myself.

01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:21.508
I don't like ginger.

01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:28.845
That was a lousy thing
you did this afternoon.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:35.638
I'm makin' 'em tough, Mr. Patroy.
Cause it is tough.

01:01:37.305 --> 01:01:38.705
You're trompin' on 'em.

01:01:39.856 --> 01:01:41.589
What do you know about it?

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:45.819
They are going out into a world
where they gotta go by the man.

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:48.719
They gotta please the
man and see him smile.

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:50.734
That's a crock o' shit, Mrs. Scott.

01:01:55.576 --> 01:02:02.176
You're young, and you're cocky,
and you got that thin white skin.

01:02:02.906 --> 01:02:06.706
Well that's just fine for you.
I don't have your advantages.

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:09.805
I've always known I was colored.

01:02:10.363 --> 01:02:12.887
When I was a negro,
I knew I was colored.

01:02:13.648 --> 01:02:17.148
And now that I'm black,
I know which color that is.

01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:22.579
So I just try to please the man,
and everything rolls along just fine.

01:02:32.907 --> 01:02:33.907
Thank you.

01:04:12.787 --> 01:04:17.087
That's called "The Flight of the Bumble-Bee",
by Rimsky-Korsakov.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.286
- Did you hear them bees in it?
- Just like a honey tree.

01:04:20.759 --> 01:04:22.125
Any honey trees on Yamacraw?

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.760
Yeah, there are honey trees.
On the beach, too.

01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:27.204
- Bees sting.
- Bees sting bad.

01:04:27.815 --> 01:04:29.715
Who wrote this song
about a lotta bees?

01:04:29.984 --> 01:04:31.184
Ricky Horse-a-cop!

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:33.409
Yeah, that's ol' Ricky, all right.

01:04:34.075 --> 01:04:35.675
Gang, we're gonna learn
all these records.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:38.697
We're gonna look like geniuses
when we know all these songs.

01:04:38.753 --> 01:04:43.386
Visitors are gonna come here,
expecting nothing but stupidity and poverty.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.414
I'm gonna switch on
this record player.

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.630
You're gonna look those
people right in the eye

01:04:49.412 --> 01:04:51.679
and exclaim, "Are you perchance...

01:04:52.767 --> 01:04:55.167
familiar with the works
of Rimsky-Korsakov?"

01:04:56.175 --> 01:05:00.708
We'll knock their behinds off.
Now... here we got something very sweet.

01:05:08.331 --> 01:05:09.564
Brahms' "Lullaby".

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.553
You don't need any Seconal,
any Phenobarb, or any Miltown.

01:05:15.593 --> 01:05:19.493
You just drop this on,
and the Sandman's got you.

01:05:23.241 --> 01:05:24.241
Go to sleep.

01:05:56.592 --> 01:05:58.459
You gonna remember
this sleepy-time cat?

01:05:59.415 --> 01:06:02.882
- He Brahm.
- Yeah, he Brahms.

01:06:03.515 --> 01:06:04.515
Good.

01:06:06.617 --> 01:06:07.817
We'll get back to him later.

01:06:10.063 --> 01:06:12.730
Here we got the big
daddy of 'em all.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.770
On the top ten 'til
the end of time.

01:06:16.191 --> 01:06:18.491
He's a long-haired
cat named Beethoven.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.609
- Let me hear his name.
- Beetcloven.

01:06:21.946 --> 01:06:24.780
- Cloven?
- Yeah, cloven.

01:06:25.401 --> 01:06:26.401
That's close enough.

01:06:27.815 --> 01:06:30.548
Now, one of Beethoven's
most famous songs

01:06:31.076 --> 01:06:32.476
was the 5th Symphony.

01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:34.887
It was written about death.

01:06:36.074 --> 01:06:37.374
Death knockin' at the door.

01:06:37.545 --> 01:06:39.078
Death, that grim, grim reaper

01:06:40.386 --> 01:06:42.486
comin' to the house and
rappin' at the door.

01:06:44.787 --> 01:06:47.354
Does death come to
everybody's door sometime?

01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:50.936
Yeah, death come knockin' at
Mad Billy's door last winter.

01:06:52.945 --> 01:06:55.378
Well, Beethoven thought
a little bit about death

01:06:56.061 --> 01:06:57.128
and then decided

01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:59.970
that if death
were really knockin' at the door,

01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:02.999
he'd sound somethin' like this.

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:07.470
Now...

01:07:07.808 --> 01:07:09.208
I'm gonna put the
needle on this record.

01:07:11.254 --> 01:07:13.254
And we're all gonna hear death

01:07:14.127 --> 01:07:16.027
knockin' at Beetcloven's door.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.360
Do you hear that rotten death?

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.541
Do you hear old bloodsucker
Death, that son of a bitch?

01:07:48.082 --> 01:07:50.149
- Yeah, I hear him.
- Me, too.

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:51.858
That ol' Beetcloven is furious.

01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:55.290
Beetcloven would be proud of you,
Willie Mays would be proud of you.

01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:58.719
And from now on,
we're gonna be proud of ourselves.

01:07:58.766 --> 01:08:00.366
We're going up the hill, gang!

01:08:00.864 --> 01:08:04.864
A foot may slip here or there,
but nobody's gonna fall!

01:09:17.545 --> 01:09:18.545
Whatcha doin'?

01:09:20.897 --> 01:09:21.897
Needlepoint.

01:09:23.395 --> 01:09:24.395
That's sewin'.

01:09:25.425 --> 01:09:26.425
That's right.

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:29.801
- Women sew.
- Well, there's a whole new thing goin' on.

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:32.359
Men do things women do,
and women do things men do.

01:09:32.514 --> 01:09:33.714
I'm makin' a pillow.

01:09:36.165 --> 01:09:37.564
You know that Mr. Quickfellow?

01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:40.354
Yeah, I know him.
What about him?

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.145
Why, he say I wake
up the devil in him,

01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:48.072
and that there ain't but one
way to lay that down again,

01:09:48.121 --> 01:09:51.020
and that's for me to go up there
to his house and live with him.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.340
- Does he know you're thirteen years old?
- Yeah, he know.

01:09:56.683 --> 01:09:59.983
Say he gonna get my daddy a new plough.
Fix up my brother's teeth.

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:01.858
What's he gonna do for you?

01:10:03.067 --> 01:10:04.801
He'll give me a new red dress.

01:10:08.321 --> 01:10:09.588
He'd be gettin'
you pretty cheap.

01:10:10.567 --> 01:10:12.067
Well, it ain't no
bidness of yours nohow.

01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:17.108
All right, go ahead. Throw your books in the
river, go back to countin' on your fingers.

01:10:17.128 --> 01:10:19.428
Have fourteen kids in a row,
look sixty when you're thirty.

01:10:19.477 --> 01:10:22.510
- Let your brain rotten in your skull.
- Why do you always pick on me?

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:27.330
Because the gospel according to Conrack is "I
will". Higher, stronger, faster, better!

01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:31.662
Not a floor scrubber but Wanda Lendowska,
not a diaper changer but Marian Anderson.

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.290
Not a pig slopper but Mary McLeod Bethune.

01:10:34.766 --> 01:10:36.866
Not a fry cook but Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:10:36.871 --> 01:10:40.938
"Aut Caesar aut nullus" - that's Latin -
"Either a Caesar or a nobody."

01:10:55.810 --> 01:11:00.410
"Grandma, Grandma, you ain't sick,
All you need is a hickory stick!"

01:11:00.478 --> 01:11:04.778
"Hands up, shake, shake, shake, shake,
Hands down, shake, shake, shake, shake."

01:11:05.284 --> 01:11:07.650
That's the littlest pinky I ever seen.

01:11:07.689 --> 01:11:10.222
Yeah, that pinky's about as
big as a dried-up raisin.

01:11:10.319 --> 01:11:12.719
How do you find that little pinky
when you go lookin' for it?

01:11:12.826 --> 01:11:14.893
All right, you little skunks, knock it off!
Everybody shut up!

01:11:17.075 --> 01:11:19.275
On the outside of every men's room
in the world is the word "Gentlemen".

01:11:19.403 --> 01:11:20.503
I'll tell you what that means.

01:11:21.619 --> 01:11:24.619
A gentleman treats his fellow man with
respect for his person and for his dignity.

01:11:24.699 --> 01:11:27.899
He doesn't slander his religion,
his color or his pecker.

01:11:28.401 --> 01:11:31.901
And if he does any of these things around me,
I'm gonna lay this fist 'longside his jaw.

01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:33.052
Now get outta here!

01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:40.333
Button up, Mac Arthur.

01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:42.689
And listen to me.

01:11:46.215 --> 01:11:48.015
I been in a lot of locker rooms.

01:11:48.861 --> 01:11:53.561
And I can tell you that for your age and size,
what you got there is a baseball bat.

01:12:06.681 --> 01:12:08.981
What's the longest stinkin' river in the
whole wide world?

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:10.271
The Nile!

01:12:10.522 --> 01:12:12.989
- What continent is it on?
- Africa!

01:12:13.227 --> 01:12:15.960
- Who comes from Africa?
- Black people!

01:12:16.072 --> 01:12:18.539
- I came from Africa!
- No!

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.584
Yeah, I came from Africa 'cause
I'm white with blue eyes!

01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:24.774
- Ireland is a country in Africa!
- No!

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:27.198
- James Brown came from Ireland!
- No!

01:12:28.155 --> 01:12:31.555
- What's the largest planet in the universe?
- Jupiter!

01:12:31.717 --> 01:12:33.817
- Second largest?
- Saturn!

01:12:33.834 --> 01:12:35.634
- Nearest star?
- The sun!

01:12:35.759 --> 01:12:38.359
- The largest country in the world?
- Russia!

01:12:39.283 --> 01:12:41.716
- Country with the most people!
- China!

01:12:41.749 --> 01:12:44.449
- James Brown came from China!
- No!

01:12:45.176 --> 01:12:47.843
- Who was the first president?
- George Washington!

01:12:47.913 --> 01:12:51.113
- The second president was Pat Conroy!
- You crazy!

01:12:51.209 --> 01:12:53.076
- Who crazy?
- You crazy!

01:12:53.424 --> 01:12:57.281
- What country do we live in, gang?
- The United States of America!

01:12:57.366 --> 01:13:00.066
- What state do we live in?
- South Carolina!

01:13:00.205 --> 01:13:02.405
- You sure?
- Yeah, we sure!

01:13:02.439 --> 01:13:04.939
- Where are we fightin' a war?
- Vietnam!

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:07.817
- Who's the president of Vietnam?
- Ho Chi Minh!

01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:09.619
- Who?
- Ho Chi Minh!

01:13:09.634 --> 01:13:13.001
- What's James Brown's greatest song?
- "Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud"!

01:13:13.096 --> 01:13:17.296
No, it's not! His greatest song is
"Say It Loud, I'm White and I'm Proud!"

01:13:17.323 --> 01:13:20.823
No, it's not!

01:13:25.955 --> 01:13:26.955
You see?

01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:29.082
He's tuckin' away for winter.

01:13:30.462 --> 01:13:32.862
Hey, gang! See this fella over here?
We got a visitor.

01:13:34.236 --> 01:13:37.036
We got an armadillo.
A genuine armadillo.

01:13:40.358 --> 01:13:41.625
This is a good time of year.

01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:46.264
Things slow down.
Shadow begins to stretch longer and longer.

01:13:48.283 --> 01:13:51.950
Trees lose their leaves.
You begin to see the skeleton of nature.

01:13:52.593 --> 01:13:55.226
And that reminds me.
Hey, gang!

01:13:55.259 --> 01:13:57.225
What are we doin'
on October 31st?

01:13:57.255 --> 01:13:58.955
- Nuttin'.
- October 31st?

01:13:59.224 --> 01:14:02.024
Come on, man!
Something's goin' on on October 31st.

01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:03.626
- What's that?
- A holiday.

01:14:03.702 --> 01:14:04.802
A holiday?

01:14:04.956 --> 01:14:07.923
Yeah, where you go from door to door
with bags in your grubby little hands.

01:14:08.392 --> 01:14:11.792
- What you talkin' about, Conrack?
- Yeah, what you talkin about?

01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:13.831
Haven't you guys ever
heard of Halloween?

01:14:14.054 --> 01:14:16.388
- Halloween?
- No, we ain't heard.

01:14:16.795 --> 01:14:18.262
You mean to tell me

01:14:19.191 --> 01:14:22.191
that you never dressed up like Frankenstein
and went out trick-or-treatin'?

01:14:22.436 --> 01:14:24.203
Man crazy.

01:14:24.231 --> 01:14:25.631
- Trick-or-treatin'?
- Frankenstein?

01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:29.831
You have never gone out and rung bells and
been handed Candy Corn and all-day suckers,

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:33.000
peanut butter cups and
bubblegum and Fig Newtons?

01:14:33.009 --> 01:14:34.609
- Bubblegum? No!
- No, we ain't had that.

01:14:35.792 --> 01:14:36.792
That...

01:14:37.245 --> 01:14:38.511
That is ridiculous!

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:41.576
That is completely ridiculous.
That is un-American!

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.045
And completely ridiculous.

01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:45.537
Halloween is one of the truly
great parts of bein' a kid.

01:14:46.454 --> 01:14:47.787
I never heard of it.

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:51.437
- We're going to Beaufort.
- Beaufort?

01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:56.331
Yeah!

01:14:57.009 --> 01:15:00.009
Yeah, we're gonna go there!
And we're gonna ring... Hey!

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.695
We're gonna ring
every bell in town.

01:15:01.749 --> 01:15:03.516
And we're gonna rot our
teeth and stuff our guts

01:15:03.548 --> 01:15:05.281
and we're gonna participate
in this great celebration,

01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:08.699
or my name isn't
Patroy Conrack Conroy!

01:15:08.725 --> 01:15:09.725
Which it isn't.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.310
- How we goin'?
- Yeah, how we goin'?

01:15:11.332 --> 01:15:13.932
We are goin' in a balloon.

01:15:16.088 --> 01:15:17.888
Okay. We're goin' in
my private submarine.

01:15:18.408 --> 01:15:19.578
What's a submarine?

01:15:19.703 --> 01:15:21.632
A submarine is a boat
that goes under the water.

01:15:21.706 --> 01:15:22.906
Just like, you see, Veola's hair?

01:15:23.444 --> 01:15:25.511
That little periscope she
got stickin' up there?

01:15:26.244 --> 01:15:29.544
We're gonna go under the water, take a
deep breath, and we're on to Beaufort.

01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:20.058
- Pat Conroy!
- Hello, Mr. Spaulding.

01:16:20.077 --> 01:16:22.777
- Haven't seen you in some time, Pat.
- I've been away, teachin'.

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.878
That's splendid.

01:16:24.003 --> 01:16:25.802
I'm bringing' my kids
to Beaufort for Halloween.

01:16:26.404 --> 01:16:27.504
I gotta sleep 'em someplace.

01:16:27.518 --> 01:16:30.218
Could you and Mrs. Spaulding find
room for two of 'em just for one night?

01:16:30.327 --> 01:16:32.427
It's a big house.
I should think so.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.460
They're black.

01:16:36.087 --> 01:16:40.587
- You say these little children are black?
- As the ace of spades, Mrs. Webster.

01:16:41.688 --> 01:16:45.021
Well, I s'pose it would
be the right thing to do.

01:16:45.249 --> 01:16:46.249
Then do it.

01:16:47.157 --> 01:16:51.157
I couldn't do it on my own.
I'd have to consult my husband.

01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:53.830
Well...
I'll call back.

01:17:00.294 --> 01:17:05.527
They can sleep in Freddy's room. He's gone
off on a commune in Oregon somewhere.

01:17:06.428 --> 01:17:08.328
Thank you, Mrs. Sellers.

01:17:09.335 --> 01:17:11.868
Uh... they don't wet their
beds, do they?

01:17:13.591 --> 01:17:15.291
Not to my knowledge, ma'am.

01:17:15.878 --> 01:17:16.878
That's good.

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:19.910
Phew.

01:17:37.613 --> 01:17:39.079
What do you want, Pat?

01:17:41.287 --> 01:17:43.087
How did you know it was me?

01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:47.303
You're the only one I know who'd
get up to such foolishness.

01:17:47.886 --> 01:17:50.852
It's for Halloween.
I'm bringin' my kids over here.

01:17:52.924 --> 01:17:55.357
A trip like that ain't
worth a pound of cow dung.

01:17:56.494 --> 01:18:00.127
Those kids don't need trips.
They need fundamentals.

01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:03.114
They need drill, and more drill.

01:18:03.925 --> 01:18:06.425
That's what you think they need.
It's not what I think they need.

01:18:08.538 --> 01:18:09.538
Now, listen here.

01:18:10.383 --> 01:18:14.883
Last Christmas I sent two big turkeys out of
my freezer over to those children on Yamacraw.

01:18:14.973 --> 01:18:19.307
And I'm willin' to send ten pounds
of penny candy for Halloween.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.933
But I don't want 'em
shovin' and pushin' and...

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.333
runnin' wild in Beaufort.

01:18:29.607 --> 01:18:30.707
That clear to you?

01:18:32.472 --> 01:18:36.172
Mr. Skeffington,
those kids are my responsibility.

01:18:36.197 --> 01:18:38.496
And it's up to me to decide
how best to educate them.

01:18:45.069 --> 01:18:46.869
Now look, boy.

01:18:49.068 --> 01:18:51.268
This is my bailiwick.

01:18:51.412 --> 01:18:54.679
This is my cotton patch,
and you're my hired hand.

01:18:56.351 --> 01:18:59.151
You stay on the other
side of that river,

01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:03.210
or by God you're gonna see a
side of me you never seen before.

01:19:15.922 --> 01:19:16.922
Boss...

01:19:17.976 --> 01:19:21.476
Those kids are gonna spend Halloween the
way the rest of the kids in America spend it.

01:19:22.777 --> 01:19:24.177
And if you want to raise hell about it,

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.728
then raise it.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.480
Thank you, Frieda.

01:20:06.794 --> 01:20:09.361
- What's happenin' with you guys?
- Can't go.

01:20:11.108 --> 01:20:13.041
- What're you talkin' about?
- Ain't goin'.

01:20:14.924 --> 01:20:16.591
What do you mean, "ain't goin"?

01:20:17.806 --> 01:20:19.406
We're all goin'.
It's all planned.

01:20:19.677 --> 01:20:22.211
- Not goin' nowhere.
- Be right here.

01:20:23.217 --> 01:20:24.217
What happened?

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.053
My grandmother just laugh
when I say we goin'.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.453
My mama just say no.

01:20:29.442 --> 01:20:31.675
They ain't gonna let you go trick-or-treatin'?
That's just crap.

01:20:31.964 --> 01:20:34.064
My mama tell me
not to bother her.

01:20:34.894 --> 01:20:36.394
Listen.
Go home tonight,

01:20:37.077 --> 01:20:38.411
sit down in the
middle of the kitchen

01:20:39.136 --> 01:20:40.769
beat your fists on the
floor, kick your feet,

01:20:41.217 --> 01:20:44.117
hold your breath 'til your eyes pop
out and refuse all food and drink.

01:20:44.332 --> 01:20:46.565
My mama kill me if I
do somethin' like that.

01:20:47.029 --> 01:20:51.162
- You go tell 'em, Conrack.
- Yeah, you go tell 'em.

01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:55.330
We're goin'.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.018
Don't worry.

01:21:13.222 --> 01:21:14.222
Hey!

01:21:14.482 --> 01:21:15.482
Hey!

01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:19.625
Hey! Hey! Back in the house!
Come on! Go on back in.

01:21:19.843 --> 01:21:21.343
Go on back.
Go on back.

01:21:21.394 --> 01:21:23.528
Hey! Go on back into the house.
Come on. Come on.

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.679
Come on. Back in. Back in.

01:21:26.567 --> 01:21:28.634
You all right now, man.
Come on down.

01:21:32.325 --> 01:21:34.592
Well...
What do you want from Edna?

01:21:35.831 --> 01:21:39.298
I wanna talk to you about your
grandchildren who are in my class at school.

01:21:39.783 --> 01:21:40.783
God.

01:21:41.987 --> 01:21:45.287
God Almighty!
You Mr. Conrack!

01:21:45.655 --> 01:21:48.055
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh God, Mr. Conrack.

01:21:48.122 --> 01:21:52.422
My grands love Mr. Conrack!
So that's who you are.

01:21:52.852 --> 01:21:55.419
- The white schoolteacher.
- Yes, ma'am. That's who I am.

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:59.444
- People say you a wonderful teacher.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Graves.

01:21:59.494 --> 01:22:02.594
- God, you a good-lookin' teacher.
- I'm delighted you think so.

01:22:02.649 --> 01:22:06.149
Yes, you a fine-lookin' teacher.
You a fine-lookin' man.

01:22:06.853 --> 01:22:09.153
You got a nice face
for a white teacher.

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.283
Actually, some people think
I got a nose like a pig.

01:22:12.516 --> 01:22:15.116
Oh, no, you got a beautiful nose.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.820
Pig nose look so bad.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:19.409
Yes, I'm certified good-lookin'.
Are you g-

01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:23.450
Are you gonna let me take your
grandchildren to Beaufort for Halloween?

01:22:26.062 --> 01:22:27.062
No, I ain't.

01:22:29.902 --> 01:22:31.469
You are the queen bee around
here, Mrs. Graves.

01:22:31.706 --> 01:22:33.606
If you say yes,
they'll all say yes.

01:22:33.717 --> 01:22:34.717
I say no.

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:36.930
Mrs. Graves...

01:22:37.365 --> 01:22:39.065
Beaufort's got a public library,

01:22:39.599 --> 01:22:40.599
a county courthouse,

01:22:40.952 --> 01:22:42.719
a movin' picture show, and a park.

01:22:43.641 --> 01:22:45.241
I'm afraid of the river.

01:22:46.813 --> 01:22:48.513
I lose three family in the river.

01:22:49.624 --> 01:22:51.724
I ain't gonna lose no
grands to that river.

01:22:52.026 --> 01:22:53.326
Nothin' will happen to 'em.

01:22:53.889 --> 01:22:54.922
I'll watch 'em night and day.

01:22:54.972 --> 01:22:58.239
May God take my left testicle if I
don't bring 'em back safe and sound.

01:22:59.687 --> 01:23:01.653
God.
You a good-lookin' white man.

01:23:01.753 --> 01:23:04.520
- Are you startin' that again?
- Yes, you sure good-lookin'.

01:23:04.566 --> 01:23:09.632
Well... Edna. I'm sure glad you like my
looks, 'cause I sure do like yours.

01:23:10.334 --> 01:23:11.334
- How about...
- Look out!

01:23:11.834 --> 01:23:13.567
Here come them dogs again!

01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:25.090
What's them old lines for?

01:24:26.415 --> 01:24:27.415
What old lines?

01:24:27.712 --> 01:24:29.979
Those old lines
all over the road.

01:24:30.118 --> 01:24:31.918
Oh, you mean the lines
that divide the highway?

01:24:31.985 --> 01:24:34.185
They tell the driver which side
of the road he can stay on.

01:24:35.364 --> 01:24:39.097
Lines with spaces between 'em tell
the driver he can pass another car.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.093
Somebody had to walk a
long way to paint 'em on.

01:24:50.451 --> 01:24:55.751
- This sure is a fine town.
- This the best town I ever seen.

01:24:55.773 --> 01:24:58.873
This the only town you ever
see, you big fool.

01:24:58.925 --> 01:25:01.392
You call me a fool,
I bust your head.

01:25:02.645 --> 01:25:03.645
All right. Ready!

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.233
Set!

01:25:05.237 --> 01:25:06.237
Go!

01:25:44.163 --> 01:25:45.963
You can do that again, son.

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:48.541
Yech.

01:25:54.468 --> 01:25:56.235
Who can tell me what that means?

01:25:58.771 --> 01:25:59.771
Come on.

01:26:01.438 --> 01:26:04.505
We does what you tells us, Conrack,
and when we's old, we still does it.

01:26:05.231 --> 01:26:06.298
Carlos...

01:26:06.437 --> 01:26:09.337
Either you're one of the great ass-kissers
of the world or you finally learned to read.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.026
Who has to use the bathroom?

01:26:12.526 --> 01:26:13.793
Okay,
this is as good a place as any.

01:26:15.018 --> 01:26:17.551
Boys to the right,
girls to the left.

01:26:19.481 --> 01:26:20.481
There you go.

01:26:28.298 --> 01:26:30.764
- Everybody wash your hands!
- Okay!

01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:49.437
You look terrific.

01:26:50.785 --> 01:26:52.619
The girls are beautiful,
and the boys are groovy.

01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:54.601
Now, listen.

01:26:55.901 --> 01:26:58.234
Be nice to everybody,
be polite and say thank you.

01:26:59.225 --> 01:27:00.892
But if they turn you
away empty-handed,

01:27:01.404 --> 01:27:03.471
we're gonna soap their windows
and dump their garbage.

01:27:04.536 --> 01:27:05.736
Okay, gang. Good luck.

01:27:05.748 --> 01:27:07.715
Say thank you to Mrs.
Sellers on your way out.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:12.032
- Thank you, Mrs. Sellers.
- Thank you.

01:27:21.451 --> 01:27:24.451
- Thank you, Mrs. Sellers.
- You're welcome!

01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:51.664
- Trick or treat, trick or treat...
- Trick or treat, trick or treat...

01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:56.161
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

01:27:59.737 --> 01:28:01.637
- Trick or treat...
- Trick or treat...

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.768
Trick or treat! Trick or treat!

01:28:12.581 --> 01:28:15.481
My, my, my,
what do we have here?

01:28:16.531 --> 01:28:20.831
I don't know whether to be scared out
of my wits or charmed out of my shoes.

01:28:21.533 --> 01:28:25.366
I guess I just have to pass out
chocolate kisses and sugar cookies.

01:28:36.443 --> 01:28:37.643
Good evenin', Pat.

01:28:38.987 --> 01:28:40.254
Evening, Mr. Skeffington.

01:28:41.676 --> 01:28:42.909
Don't let  'em eat too much.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.067
They'll get a tummy ache.

01:28:47.053 --> 01:28:48.053
Shoo!

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:52.150
All right.

01:29:02.608 --> 01:29:08.474
"On the good ship Lollipop
Itâ€™s a sweet trip to the candy shop"

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:16.027
"Where the bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay."

01:29:16.099 --> 01:29:21.832
"Lemonade stands everywhere,
Crackerjack bands fill the air."

01:29:21.879 --> 01:29:28.079
"And there you are
Happy landin' on a chocolate bar."

01:29:28.417 --> 01:29:34.217
"On the good ship Lollipop
Itâ€™s a sweet trip to the candy shop"

01:29:40.194 --> 01:29:42.994
- I'm fired.
- Tsk, tsk, that's a shame.

01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:46.526
Buddy, you don't get
a tip for this one.

01:29:51.667 --> 01:29:54.267
Only one thing to do!

01:29:54.535 --> 01:29:55.768
What's that? We listenin'!

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:59.557
- We gonna strike the school!
- Yeah!

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:03.510
Ain't no children gonna go
to that schoolhouse door!

01:30:03.812 --> 01:30:05.212
Right!

01:30:05.453 --> 01:30:09.253
That ol' schoolhouse is gonna look
mighty empty with no children in it.

01:30:10.378 --> 01:30:13.711
Anybody... anybody send
their children to school,

01:30:14.083 --> 01:30:16.183
- they get beat up!
- Right!

01:30:16.558 --> 01:30:19.558
We beat up anyone
who break the strike!

01:30:19.675 --> 01:30:22.075
We beat 'em...
we beat 'em with sticks!

01:30:22.112 --> 01:30:24.779
I got a big stick, too!
Don't you worry!

01:30:25.702 --> 01:30:28.035
Edna, I appreciate the support,
but if you strike the school,

01:30:28.088 --> 01:30:31.721
you're gonna have the sheriff comin' over
here and threatenin' to put you in jail.

01:30:31.767 --> 01:30:33.667
I tell that sheriff

01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:37.509
- to get his ass outta my yard!
- Yeah!

01:30:37.685 --> 01:30:42.985
I tell him he can put Edna under
the jail for ninety-nine years!

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:49.505
Our children don't go to no
schoolhouse 'til Conrack in it!

01:30:49.676 --> 01:30:51.676
Yeah!

01:30:58.042 --> 01:30:59.042
Now...

01:30:59.808 --> 01:31:02.108
I'm not scolding, Mr. Patroy.

01:31:03.398 --> 01:31:07.431
But you did go swimming naked
where everybody could see you.

01:31:08.037 --> 01:31:10.537
You did cuss in
front of your babies.

01:31:11.269 --> 01:31:13.402
You bought moonshine whiskey.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.760
And you tacked up a picture of a
woman's bare vagina in your classroom.

01:31:20.111 --> 01:31:25.011
- That was a Picasso, Mrs. Scott!
- It was a woman's bare vagina.

01:31:31.835 --> 01:31:33.468
You'll get on someplace else.

01:31:33.474 --> 01:31:34.841
I don't wanna be anyplace else.

01:31:35.854 --> 01:31:39.454
Then why don't you fight
them, Mr. Patroy? I would.

01:31:43.212 --> 01:31:45.445
I thought you'd be glad
to see me go, Mrs. Scott.

01:31:46.268 --> 01:31:47.935
Oh... you's all right.

01:31:49.194 --> 01:31:52.061
We had our... ups and downs.

01:31:52.318 --> 01:31:54.385
But I know you love the babies.

01:32:04.822 --> 01:32:05.822
Pat.

01:32:06.718 --> 01:32:09.652
This little fella could eat four
heads of lettuce if I let him.

01:32:10.215 --> 01:32:12.115
Mr. Skeffington,
I want my job back.

01:32:13.226 --> 01:32:14.492
I know you do, son.

01:32:15.262 --> 01:32:16.528
You could bawl me out.

01:32:16.793 --> 01:32:19.793
You could put it on my record that
I'm an incorrigible son of a bitch.

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.307
You can cut off my teacher's
pension, but I want my job back.

01:32:24.111 --> 01:32:27.444
Don't shout around these little bunnies.
It scares 'em.

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:30.283
I got some testimonials here.

01:32:30.859 --> 01:32:32.059
I'd like to read 'em to you.

01:32:32.809 --> 01:32:33.809
Let me see 'em.

01:32:43.067 --> 01:32:44.067
Spelling's terrible!

01:32:45.468 --> 01:32:47.101
But the sentiments, Mr. Skeffington.

01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:50.353
- The sentiments.
- Oh, they like ya.

01:32:51.069 --> 01:32:52.869
I like you, too.
Never said I didn't.

01:32:56.819 --> 01:33:00.019
Look, Mr. Skeffington. One of these
days, you're gonna sink into old age.

01:33:00.436 --> 01:33:02.336
Well, I'll be a comfort
to that old age.

01:33:03.332 --> 01:33:06.765
I'll get married, bring a baby by to dandle on
your knee and spit on your vest.

01:33:07.639 --> 01:33:09.972
Come by every Sunday for dinner.
Help you weed the lawn.

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:14.033
When you take to a wheelchair,
tuck a blanket round your knees.

01:33:14.053 --> 01:33:15.087
Push you down the road.

01:33:16.004 --> 01:33:18.704
Cry like hell at your funeral.
Just give me back my job.

01:33:20.978 --> 01:33:21.978
Nope.

01:33:23.719 --> 01:33:27.652
I'm gonna replace you just as
easy as I would a lightbulb.

01:33:31.249 --> 01:33:32.249
With what?

01:33:33.437 --> 01:33:36.304
Well, it won't be with
no outside agitator.

01:33:36.595 --> 01:33:38.928
Or no communist
trained in Atlanta.

01:33:39.996 --> 01:33:43.063
What're you talkin' about?
I never even been to Miami!

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:47.393
You think rules and regulations are all
bullcrap, so you just go your own way.

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:51.463
But if you're gonna survive
in this world, young man,

01:33:51.872 --> 01:33:54.272
you're gonna have to accept bullcrap.

01:33:56.588 --> 01:33:57.588
Well, sir...

01:33:58.052 --> 01:34:00.418
As long as youâ€™re
prepared to accept crap,

01:34:00.455 --> 01:34:03.655
I think I oughta tell you that that
rabbit has just done it in your lap.

01:34:11.633 --> 01:34:15.200
I didn't have this young man's privileges.
I came up the hard way.

01:34:15.756 --> 01:34:16.923
I worked in a mill.

01:34:19.398 --> 01:34:21.031
One night I stepped outside.

01:34:22.915 --> 01:34:26.282
I fell to my knees,
and I prayed to Jesus

01:34:26.347 --> 01:34:29.647
and asked him what he
wanted me to do with my life.

01:34:29.859 --> 01:34:31.259
And he said, "Teach."

01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:34.730
And so I did.
For forty years.

01:34:35.651 --> 01:34:38.384
Now, along comes this youngster.

01:34:39.746 --> 01:34:43.579
He doesn't work with the chain of command.
He doesn't communicate.

01:34:44.488 --> 01:34:48.555
He wants to denounce the old values,
he wants to erode the old values.

01:34:48.646 --> 01:34:53.146
He wants to change everything,
with a quick chop to the gonads.

01:34:55.755 --> 01:34:57.022
I'm not gonna let him.

01:35:01.845 --> 01:35:04.812
You have no lesser
punishment than a dismissal?

01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:09.238
You mean, if he's late to
school a couple of times,

01:35:09.255 --> 01:35:14.555
you have no punishment like docking
his pay or reducing his leave time?

01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:17.771
Our teachers all obey the rules, sir.

01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:20.730
We never have to discipline.

01:35:23.861 --> 01:35:24.861
Well, son...

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.687
I'm sorry.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:36.959
The superintendent has the right to fire
any teacher that he considers undesirable.

01:35:37.589 --> 01:35:40.055
And that's the law.
It's very simple.

01:36:24.626 --> 01:36:26.159
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:28.045 --> 01:36:30.245
I don't mean to take you
away from your daily routine.

01:36:30.269 --> 01:36:33.903
I know you got stores to open, clothes to
wash, marketing to do and other chores.

01:36:34.973 --> 01:36:37.306
But I just lost my
job, and I wanna talk.

01:36:38.289 --> 01:36:39.756
My name is Pat Conroy.

01:36:40.806 --> 01:36:43.239
I was paid $510 a month

01:36:43.757 --> 01:36:47.724
to teach a bunch of kids on a little island
off this coast how to read and write.

01:36:49.107 --> 01:36:50.907
I also tried to teach 'em to...

01:36:51.654 --> 01:36:56.988
embrace life openly, to reflect upon its
mysteries and to reject its cruelties.

01:36:58.176 --> 01:37:00.276
The school board of this fast city

01:37:01.027 --> 01:37:04.561
thinks that if they ruled
out troublemakers like me,

01:37:04.804 --> 01:37:07.871
the system will hold up
and perpetuate itself.

01:37:08.644 --> 01:37:11.344
They think as long as blacks
and whites are kept apart,

01:37:12.061 --> 01:37:13.761
with the whites gettin' scholarships

01:37:14.366 --> 01:37:17.166
and the blacks gettin' jobs
pickin' cotton and tomatoes,

01:37:18.621 --> 01:37:23.021
with the whites goin' to college and the
blacks eating moon pies and drinkin' Coca-Cola,

01:37:23.458 --> 01:37:26.192
that they can weather in the
storm and survive any threat.

01:37:27.201 --> 01:37:28.334
Well, they're wrong.

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:29.650
Their day is ending.

01:37:30.732 --> 01:37:33.765
They're the captains of a doomed army
retreating in the snow.

01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:36.952
They're old men,

01:37:38.095 --> 01:37:41.528
and they can't accept a new sun
rising out of strange waters.

01:37:43.389 --> 01:37:44.789
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:37:46.217 --> 01:37:47.717
the world is very different now.

01:37:49.278 --> 01:37:53.011
It's true this town still has
its die-hards and nigger haters,

01:37:53.885 --> 01:37:56.685
but they grow older and
crankier with each passing day.

01:37:57.853 --> 01:38:01.653
When Beaufort digs another four hundred
holes in her plentiful graveyards,

01:38:01.715 --> 01:38:08.015
deposits there the rouged and elderly corpses
and covers them with the sandy low country soil,

01:38:09.304 --> 01:38:11.504
then the Old South will be silenced

01:38:13.005 --> 01:38:14.671
and not heard from again.

01:38:23.266 --> 01:38:24.566
As for my kids,

01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:29.771
I don't think I changed the quality
of their lives significantly,

01:38:30.312 --> 01:38:33.312
or altered the fact that they have no
share in the country that claimed them,

01:38:34.766 --> 01:38:36.033
the country that's failed them.

01:38:40.375 --> 01:38:43.008
All I know is I felt much
beauty in my time with them.

01:39:17.050 --> 01:39:18.517
I told Quickfellow no.

01:39:20.979 --> 01:39:21.979
What'd he say?

01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:26.070
Say he'll go off to
Fenella Jackson instead.

01:39:27.131 --> 01:39:28.498
What about your daddy's plough?

01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:31.310
He can use the old one.

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:33.207
What about your red dress?

01:39:35.323 --> 01:39:36.390
I don't need it.

01:39:39.143 --> 01:39:40.310
When the time is right

01:39:41.638 --> 01:39:43.071
and you take up with a man,

01:39:46.495 --> 01:39:49.062
it should be somebody who
appreciates the honor you confer.

01:40:02.315 --> 01:40:04.481
I see everybody got
up before breakfast.

01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:06.369
Come to say goodbye, Conrack.

01:40:07.342 --> 01:40:08.342
Well...

01:40:09.914 --> 01:40:11.781
My boat will be
ready any minute.

01:40:33.292 --> 01:40:34.292
Hey.

01:40:35.266 --> 01:40:37.366
Who's the greatest baseball
player of all time?

01:40:37.485 --> 01:40:38.552
Jackie Robinson.

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.465
- What's the largest desert in the world?
- Sahara.

01:40:40.524 --> 01:40:42.191
- Closest planet to the sun.
- Mercury.

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.968
That's right, Anthony.
You got it there, kiddo.

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:46.038
What's the capital of our nation,
the good ol' United States?

01:40:46.095 --> 01:40:47.161
Washington, D.C.

01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:49.470
You remember a poem about
a man who robbed people?

01:40:49.532 --> 01:40:50.466
"The Highwayman".

01:40:50.531 --> 01:40:52.531
- And what happened to the Highwayman?
- Shot him down.

01:40:52.608 --> 01:40:54.641
Right, shot him down like
a dog on the highway.

01:40:54.686 --> 01:40:57.486
Another poem 'bout a man: "Listen,
my children, and you shall hear"?

01:40:57.575 --> 01:40:58.475
Paul Revere.

01:40:58.531 --> 01:40:59.731
What did ol' Paul do?

01:41:00.013 --> 01:41:02.880
He rode around, saying "The British are comin'!
The British are comin'!"

01:41:02.929 --> 01:41:05.396
So what if the British were comin'?
What were the people supposed to do?

01:41:05.412 --> 01:41:07.846
- Gettin' ready for the British.
- Right. Gettin' ready for the British.

01:41:07.874 --> 01:41:10.074
- But who was gettin' ready for the British?
- Minutemen.

01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:12.315
- And why would they call 'em Minutemen?
- They was ready in a minute.

01:41:12.736 --> 01:41:14.936
Okay. In what state is
Yamacraw Island located?

01:41:15.022 --> 01:41:16.022
South Carolina.

01:41:16.538 --> 01:41:18.938
Gang, what is the state
capital of South Carolina?

01:41:18.962 --> 01:41:20.562
Columbia!

01:42:05.949 --> 01:42:07.749
It hurts very
badly to leave you.

01:42:10.335 --> 01:42:11.468
My prayer for you

01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:15.274
is that the river is good
to you in the crossing.

01:42:16.305 --> 01:42:22.201
