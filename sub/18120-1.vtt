12:43.960 --> 12:46.120
What
happened?

12:46.130 --> 12:47.930
Two crazies.
Professional rip-off.

12:47.930 --> 12:51.730
They killed everyone
and made off with the goods.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.970
Unidentified white males,
25 and 30.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.800
Yeah, what do you
got there, Fred?

13:02.580 --> 13:05.110
2, 3, got it.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.110
Everywhere I go,
people are dying to meet me.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.980
Looks like they
enjoyed their work.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.080
No shit.

13:12.090 --> 13:16.090
Yo, rizzoli, you know
where we could find a maid?

13:16.090 --> 13:18.220
People like you
are the reason
abortion is legal.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.430
All right.
Let's get him out of here.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.860
Watch your back.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.800
Looks like there's
a new bag on the street.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.840
Why did you want me?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.010
Over there.

13:35.010 --> 13:36.840
Delgadillo?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
You tell me.

13:38.850 --> 13:41.180
50 bucks says
you can't identify him.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.020
Why?

13:43.020 --> 13:44.980
You want the bet
or not?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.990
5o bucks, rizzoli.

13:46.990 --> 13:49.120
Only this time,
no food stamps.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.020
You're on.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.800
Jesus, what happened
to him?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.800
Looks like they, uh...

14:00.800 --> 14:03.470
Emptied an entire clip
into his face.

14:03.470 --> 14:05.070
You owe me 50,
rizzoli.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.180
No, I don't think so.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.550
It's delgadillo...
Definitely.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.650
How do you
know that?

14:22.660 --> 14:24.860
Check the pinky ring.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.060
It's got
his initials on it.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.060
Excuse me.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.400
I've got it.
Let's go.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.040
I'll drive.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.140
Watch your step.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.110
Kroll.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.130
[Dripping]

15:11.440 --> 15:13.910
Hey, stay bent over
like that,

15:13.910 --> 15:16.440
and I'll show you
a good time.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.380
One quick hump

15:18.380 --> 15:21.080
and you'd be
in the hospital.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.880
Ever get it
doggie style?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.120
No. Tell me,
what's it like?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.920
Ha ha ha!

15:26.920 --> 15:30.090
Get these people
out of this area.

15:30.090 --> 15:32.190
You got no business
being in this area!

15:37.300 --> 15:39.130
Hey, what are you doing?

15:39.130 --> 15:41.170
Jesus!

15:45.140 --> 15:47.140
I--I'm telling
you something!

15:47.140 --> 15:49.170
You are
in big--

15:50.580 --> 15:52.210
how did you
figure that?

15:54.750 --> 15:56.310
Trucks don't bleed.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.150
You're
still here, hmm?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.790
Keeps coming up kroll.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.160
What are you
talking about now?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.330
Conrad kroll.
Heavyweight valley guy.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.330
I'm telling you,

16:45.330 --> 16:47.330
this man is
moving serious weight.

16:47.330 --> 16:49.370
On what evidence?

16:49.370 --> 16:52.970
First, the van
with the body in it

16:52.970 --> 16:55.310
said "kroll construction"
all over it.

16:55.310 --> 16:58.380
The stiff in the van,
Charlie Dawson,

16:58.380 --> 17:00.210
worked
for kroll enterprises,
security department.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.980
Let's not forget
Lou Russo.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.380
You know
what you got?
Nothing.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.349
Wait a minute.
Look at this.

17:07.349 --> 17:09.819
I pulled the file

17:09.819 --> 17:12.660
on the transcript
from the cascales bust.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.990
It says, "where did you
get the dope?"

17:16.000 --> 17:18.560
Answer--"from a fat queen
named tito delgadillo

17:18.569 --> 17:21.369
who runs a beauty shop
in encino."

17:21.369 --> 17:23.400
The beauty shop's
in kroll Plaza.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.200
Forget it.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.210
Why are you
fighting me?

17:27.210 --> 17:30.240
I feel it
in my gut!

17:30.240 --> 17:35.010
I can't take your gut
to the city attorney's office.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.420
You can't go anywhere
without evidence!

17:37.420 --> 17:40.250
That's hard evidence!

17:40.250 --> 17:42.520
Probable cause!

17:42.520 --> 17:45.060
That's straight
from captain McKay.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.530
How can I get
hard evidence

17:47.530 --> 17:50.100
if you won't let me
go talk to him?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.860
It seems
obvious to me.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.430
A year ago,
he couldn't raise bus fare.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.870
Now he's
building malls!

17:57.870 --> 18:01.240
He's riding around
in a rolls royce

18:01.240 --> 18:03.880
and sponsoring
the civic light opera,
for Christ's sake!

18:03.880 --> 18:06.040
He's also sponsoring

18:06.050 --> 18:09.410
a couple of
heavyweight politicians
down at city hall.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.680
That scare you,
lieutenant?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.720
No.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.630
<i> You scare me,
rizzoli.</i>

18:20.630 --> 18:24.060
Writing on
the goddamn walls,
huh?

18:24.060 --> 18:27.100
The names
of dead junkies.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.930
Jesus.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.100
What the hell
do you do?

18:31.100 --> 18:33.440
What do you do?

18:33.440 --> 18:36.410
Draw a line through
a dead junkie's name

18:36.410 --> 18:38.940
every time you
take a dealer out?

18:38.950 --> 18:40.950
Something like that.
Yeah.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.480
Why?

18:43.480 --> 18:47.120
It's a long, long story,
but I'll tell you this.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.490
If you let me
go talk to kroll,

18:50.490 --> 18:53.330
I'll wash the walls
and windows clean myself.

18:53.330 --> 18:56.130
You know I hate
to do windows.

18:56.130 --> 18:58.760
Go home
and get some sleep.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.100
Get lucky, get laid,
get out of my face.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.940
If I were you,
I'd stay away from Conrad kroll.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.110
Jesus!

19:07.110 --> 19:10.380
"Get laid." Please.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.020
Hey, you
got any coke?

19:34.500 --> 19:36.700
Come on.
Get out of here.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.200
Watch it!

19:38.210 --> 19:39.400
Jesus, guys.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.380
This is
a private table.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.020
Not anymore
it's not.

19:54.020 --> 19:58.160

Listen, uh...

20:49.880 --> 20:53.210
I'm not sure I know
this tito delgadillo.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.250
Well, you've
missed your shot.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.050
He's no longer
with us.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.720
We all go sometime.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.420
But the upside is,

21:01.420 --> 21:03.520
we don't all
have to go without.

in here.

21:47.130 --> 21:48.630
Hey,
it ought to.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.470

21:50.470 --> 21:55.940
I think I will have
a pastrami on rye.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.840

21:57.840 --> 21:59.640

22:28.640 --> 22:31.380
I'm going to
kick your ass,

22:31.380 --> 22:34.250

I'll fuck your brains out.

really funny.

around here, huh?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.700
Try and laugh this off.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.240

Did you lose something?

23:01.580 --> 23:04.180
You picked
my goddamn pocket!

23:04.180 --> 23:06.680
That's a felony,
I think.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.550

there are two things

23:33.210 --> 23:36.770
I don't like in the world.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.440
One is to be called "bitch."

23:39.450 --> 23:41.950
The other
is steak tartare.

23:41.950 --> 23:45.220
Now, I have had
a shitty day,

23:45.220 --> 23:48.050
so do us both a favor.

23:48.050 --> 23:51.590
Put down the knife,
take your ass out of here,

23:51.590 --> 23:54.690
and we'll
call it a night, ok?

23:58.630 --> 24:01.070
Ok, bust me.
I don't care.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.770
Make my day.
Go ahead!

24:03.770 --> 24:06.240

best at, isn't it?

24:06.240 --> 24:07.970

want to bust you.

not going to bust me?

I'm going to need a fix bad,

27:02.080 --> 27:03.980
<i> ¶ ooh ¶</i>

27:03.980 --> 27:05.020
<i> ¶ I say it's criminal ¶</i>

27:07.990 --> 27:09.820
<i> ¶ you got to
 lay it on the line ¶</i>

27:09.820 --> 27:11.920
<i> ¶ now every single time ¶</i>

27:11.930 --> 27:13.690
<i> ¶ you never
 get a second ch-- ¶¶</i>

27:19.000 --> 27:21.800
can I help you?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.070
Yeah, I'm looking
for Conrad kroll.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.180
Hi, there.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.010
Good morning.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.850
What's your business,
miss, uh...

27:34.850 --> 27:36.610
Detective rizzoli.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.620
And what might
your name be?

27:39.620 --> 27:41.650
Mike marshak.

27:41.650 --> 27:43.860
I'm head of security
for kroll enterprises.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.490
Oh.

27:45.490 --> 27:47.490
Mr. kroll isn't in.

27:47.490 --> 27:50.190
That's his car,
isn't it?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.830
Maybe he
took another one
when he left.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.300
You got it.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.200
Try kroll Plaza
on ventura.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.040
I just
came from there.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.840
I can't help you.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.640
I could go in
and wait.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.040
Rizzoli.
That's Italian, isn't it?

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
Mm-hmm.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.480
I always had a weakness
for Italian ladies.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.050
In school,
there was one,

28:13.050 --> 28:15.050
this rose amalfitano.

28:15.050 --> 28:16.490
My God, those eyes.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.860
She had one problem.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.890
She thought those
beautiful brown eyes

28:20.890 --> 28:23.860
could get her
anything she wanted.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.660
Maybe all
pretty Italian ladies

28:25.670 --> 28:26.900
feel that way.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.070
Figure?

28:29.070 --> 28:31.870
What's your point?

28:31.870 --> 28:35.070
The point is,
this is private property.

28:35.070 --> 28:37.170
If you want to
come calling,

28:37.180 --> 28:38.880
show me a warrant.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.080
<i>Otherwise,
 arrivederci.</i>

28:41.080 --> 28:44.680
For all this,
we had to go through
rose amalfitano?

28:44.680 --> 28:47.080
Just trying
to be friendly.

28:47.090 --> 28:47.950
Oh.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.920
My name's
detective rizzoli.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.950
I have
some questions.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.290
Relax, Marty.

29:25.290 --> 29:28.130
Sweet, but slow.

29:28.130 --> 29:31.930
It's tough
to get good help
these days.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.970
Detective rizzoli's
gone to all this trouble

29:33.970 --> 29:36.300
to see us.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.970
We should oblige her.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.040
Would you hand me
a towel?

29:42.940 --> 29:45.080
Seeing you
raises a question

29:45.080 --> 29:46.980
in my mind.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.580
Yeah? What's that?

29:48.580 --> 29:51.950
Does that come
in adult size?

29:51.950 --> 29:52.980
That's very funny,
rizzoli.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.090
Thank you.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.820
Let's discuss it
over lunch.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.060
I'd love it.

29:59.990 --> 30:02.830
To what do I owe
the honor

30:02.830 --> 30:04.430
of this visit?

30:04.430 --> 30:06.260
Last night
in Chinatown,

30:06.270 --> 30:07.970
several people
were killed.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.600
One is a tenant
of yours,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.770
tito delgadillo,
a drug dealer.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.440
Two of the others
worked for you.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.170
Yeah, Russo and, uh...

30:17.180 --> 30:18.810
Charlie Dawson.

30:18.810 --> 30:20.180
Yeah, Charlie Dawson.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.180
That's terrible.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.850
Of course,
I hardly knew them.

30:24.850 --> 30:27.820
I guess
you didn't know
they did time

30:27.820 --> 30:29.020
in vaccaville
for narcotics.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.190
I didn't know that.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.620
They were
packaging narcotics,

30:32.630 --> 30:35.460
in large quantity,
as I hear it,

30:35.460 --> 30:37.030
and they got
ripped off.

30:37.030 --> 30:40.130
No!

30:40.130 --> 30:41.470
If I was speaking
hypothetically,

30:41.470 --> 30:43.300
which I am,

30:43.300 --> 30:46.800
and I thought
my dope was stolen,

30:46.810 --> 30:49.010
I wouldn't be
sitting by the pool
drinking wine.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.140
If we were speaking
hypothetically.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.010
I don't believe
that you're implying

30:53.010 --> 30:56.650
that I was involved with
these...Narcotic dealings.

30:56.650 --> 31:00.220
But you are,
aren't you?
I never said that.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.020
You are.
No, I'm not.

31:02.020 --> 31:05.490
That's the most
incredible thing
I've ever heard.

31:05.490 --> 31:09.030
Of course, I read
that your stock

31:09.030 --> 31:11.700
was down nine points
since the beginning
of the year.

31:11.700 --> 31:15.170
That would panic
any normal guy.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.200
Get me
the narcotics division.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.840
Maybe you were
overextended.

31:19.840 --> 31:23.070
This is Conrad kroll.
Does a rizzoli
work for you?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.080
Detective,
if you don't mind.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.080
She accused me
of dealing narcotics.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.250
I never said that.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.520
He wants to talk
to you.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.520
Can I get you something?
Some humble pie?

31:35.520 --> 31:38.090
He's offering me
humble pie.
He's a real clown.

31:38.090 --> 31:41.260
I don't mean
he's a clown--
see, what--

31:41.260 --> 31:44.430
you said if you were me,
you wouldn't come here.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.530
<i>I decided
you weren't me,
so here I am.</i>

31:46.530 --> 31:50.200
He uses
such rash language.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.240
All right.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.940
Yes, sir.

31:52.940 --> 31:56.070
If they let you go,
I'll hire you.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.540
The pay is better

31:57.540 --> 32:00.910
than the police department.

32:00.910 --> 32:04.120
Yeah, but you got
a shitty health plan.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.080
Listen, drop by anytime.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.550
Use the front door
next time.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.750
That's very white
of you.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.190
Bye, Marty.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.130
Jesus, Marty.
Christ.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.560
Go get me
Mike marshak.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.300
The next time somebody
sneaks up on me--

32:21.300 --> 32:23.170
you understand
what I'm saying?

32:25.740 --> 32:27.470
Shit.

32:27.470 --> 32:30.910
<i> Attention, all units--
918 at 1033 north cherokee.</i>

32:30.910 --> 32:32.910
<i> Officer needs assistance.
 Use caution.</i>

32:32.910 --> 32:35.480
<i> Suspect could be armed.
 Code 3.</i>

32:43.920 --> 32:46.160
<i>[Megaphone]
 We are willing to talk.</i>

32:46.160 --> 32:50.130
<i> No one wants to hurt you.</i>

32:50.130 --> 32:53.130
<i> You are
 completely surrounded.</i>

32:53.130 --> 32:55.130
<i> Please throw
 your weapon out,</i>

32:55.130 --> 32:59.140
<i> and come out
 with your hands up.</i>

32:59.140 --> 33:00.940
We may need
tear gas.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.940
Hey, Carl.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.340
What are you
doing here?

33:05.340 --> 33:08.150
I was going
to charlene farr's place

33:08.150 --> 33:10.150
and heard the call.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.620
That's her place.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.150
I hope
she didn't use

33:14.150 --> 33:16.190
the same drugs
as this guy.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.160
What guy? Carl.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.620
What--Carl!

33:20.630 --> 33:22.190
<i> You are
 completely surrounded.</i>

33:22.200 --> 33:24.330
Hey, Rita!
Ha ha ha!

33:24.330 --> 33:26.800
What is he doing
over there?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.000
Fools rush in.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Shigeta.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.040
Here he comes!

33:32.040 --> 33:33.370
Jesus!

33:33.370 --> 33:36.040
He's hopped up!

33:36.040 --> 33:38.040
He's got a gun.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.010
Careful!
He's wired up!

33:40.010 --> 33:42.350
I'm a nice man.
I'm a respectable man.

33:42.350 --> 33:44.320
Drop the gun!

33:44.320 --> 33:45.850
Fuck you,
little man!

33:45.850 --> 33:47.250
Fire!
Fire!

33:51.020 --> 33:53.190
Stay there,
shigeta!

33:53.190 --> 33:55.030
Hold your fire!

33:55.030 --> 33:58.000
Just stay there!
Be cool!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.260
No.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.900
What the hell's
keeping him up?

34:19.050 --> 34:21.590
He's down.
Get a paramedic here.

34:21.590 --> 34:24.260
Jesus!
It had to be pcp.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.219
He must've been
mainlining pcp.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.429
<i> Let's clear the roadblocks.</i>

34:28.429 --> 34:30.590
<i> Cordon off
 the immediate area.</i>

34:30.600 --> 34:32.960
<i> Let the paramedic people
 through.</i>

34:35.900 --> 34:38.940
<i> Units 17 and 22,
 you're clear.</i>

34:52.620 --> 34:54.120
What's wrong
with charlene?

34:54.120 --> 34:56.290
Was it the new bag?

34:56.290 --> 34:58.060
Will she live?

34:58.060 --> 35:00.420
I don't know.
What new bag?

35:00.430 --> 35:02.730
Must've been
some radical shit.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.730
Took out
both of them.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.430
Where'd she get it?

35:06.430 --> 35:08.070
Her pimp--
Jimmy something.

35:08.070 --> 35:10.070
Hangs around
those fern bars

35:10.070 --> 35:11.900
down on Melrose.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.470
Looks like
Richard gere.

35:13.470 --> 35:16.070
Huh...

35:16.080 --> 35:17.140
Aw, shit!

35:22.280 --> 35:25.320
Go run some cold water
in the tub.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.330
Grab her legs.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.290
Grab her legs!

35:36.300 --> 35:37.390
Come on, boy!

35:39.170 --> 35:40.730
Damn!

35:48.970 --> 35:50.740
Come on, charlene!

35:53.950 --> 35:56.110
Come on! Damn it!

35:56.120 --> 35:57.410
Here, let me through.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.030
Forget it.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.440
Come on.

36:25.980 --> 36:28.980
Beat it! Don't go
near kroll!

36:28.980 --> 36:30.510
Whoo!
Trouble, rizzoli?

36:30.520 --> 36:33.180
You got that $50
you owe me?

36:33.190 --> 36:35.350
Next week.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.990
Your wife probably
hears that every night.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.160
You think
that's funny?

36:39.160 --> 36:40.360
Yeah.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.360
How did it go?

36:42.360 --> 36:45.530
Fine, if you don't mind
getting your ass chewed.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.500
Fortunately,
I have more ass

36:47.500 --> 36:49.170
than he's got teeth.

36:49.170 --> 36:51.670
I contacted a friend
at vaccaville

36:51.670 --> 36:54.000
about landers, Dawson,
and Russo.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.410
<i>They were very big
with the Aryan brotherhood--</i>

36:56.410 --> 36:58.580
the white-supremacy boys.

36:58.580 --> 37:01.010
Find out
who else got out

37:01.010 --> 37:03.010
of vaccaville recently.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.750
Just the heavyweights,
though--

37:04.750 --> 37:06.680
the narcotics,
armed robbers, killers.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.550
Sure. Anything else?

37:08.550 --> 37:11.390
Yeah. Help me
find this guy

37:11.390 --> 37:14.590
who hangs out
in fern bars
on Melrose.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.390
Hear he looks like
Richard gere.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.560
Carl, line two.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.400
Who?

37:19.400 --> 37:21.270
What do
you mean, "who?"

37:21.270 --> 37:23.030
Richard gere.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.440
I can't believe
you don't know

37:25.440 --> 37:27.200
who Richard gere is.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.610
He's an actor--
tall, gorgeous guy.

37:29.610 --> 37:31.040
You better
stop going

37:31.040 --> 37:32.880
to those
cantinflas movies.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.610
You'd better start
a new wall, Rita.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.550
You'll need it.

37:37.550 --> 37:38.580
Why is that,
Jerry?

37:38.580 --> 37:40.280
This.

37:40.290 --> 37:42.790
Polterman from Metro
brought that in.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.060
Here's the stuff
you gave me.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.790
You see any difference?

37:46.790 --> 37:50.430
The markings.

37:50.430 --> 37:52.430
They're both cut
with fentanyl.

37:52.430 --> 37:55.100
This one's normal,
8 to 1.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.800
This one is 50%,
with a heavy cut of pcp.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.640
It'll kill you
or drive you insane
in less than 30 seconds.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.070
Shit. Did you
tell Kellerman?

38:04.080 --> 38:05.640
You know him.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.610
If it's street people,

38:07.610 --> 38:09.250
he calls it
population adjustment.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.910
Thanks, Jerry.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.250
Meet me on Melrose
and Fuller

38:13.250 --> 38:14.450
in an hour, ok?

38:14.450 --> 38:16.250
Why?

38:16.260 --> 38:18.120
Richard gere.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.460
Not tonight.
I got a date.

38:20.460 --> 38:21.460
Rita!

38:21.460 --> 38:22.530
Rita!

38:25.760 --> 38:27.000
Damn!

38:33.310 --> 38:34.710
Ha ha ha!

38:37.110 --> 38:38.840
How's it going,
rizzoli?

38:38.840 --> 38:41.110
Just fine.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.680
What are you
doing here?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.680
Mr. kroll sent me.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.680
Wants to make sure

38:47.690 --> 38:49.690
nothing happens
to you.

38:49.690 --> 38:52.290
You wormed your way
into his heart.

38:52.290 --> 38:54.630
Well, tell Mr. kroll

38:54.630 --> 38:56.860
nothing's going to
happen to me.

38:56.860 --> 39:00.130
I know, but the man
who pays me

39:00.130 --> 39:01.870
wants to make sure.

39:01.870 --> 39:04.500
So how about
we make friends

39:04.500 --> 39:07.300
and I follow you
for a while?

39:07.310 --> 39:09.870
Sorry, babe,
I got a date.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.040
Dressed like that?

39:14.310 --> 39:16.210
Meaning what?

39:17.550 --> 39:19.650
Meaning
you're, uh...

39:19.650 --> 39:21.520
Meaning you're
probably undercover,

39:21.520 --> 39:24.560
or, uh...You got
shitty taste.

39:26.190 --> 39:28.630
I got to go.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.700
I'm going with you.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.730
You made an asshole
out of me this morning.

39:34.730 --> 39:36.070
You won't do it again.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.240
Really?

39:44.180 --> 39:45.280
Have a good evening.

39:51.580 --> 39:52.850
¶ Hey! ¶

39:52.850 --> 39:55.590

40:19.210 --> 40:20.940
It's me.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.050
¶ Don't think about it ¶

40:23.050 --> 40:24.880
¶ don't whisper,

40:24.880 --> 40:26.950

40:26.950 --> 40:29.720

40:29.720 --> 40:31.220
Find out anything?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.890
Not yet.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.960
The night's
still young.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.960
You take that side.
I'll take this side.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.660
One fucking word,
you're dead meat.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.600
¶ I'm still shakin' ¶

41:43.660 --> 41:44.960
I found him.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.130
Oh, yeah? Where?

41:47.130 --> 41:49.870
A restaurant
two blocks down
across the street.

41:49.870 --> 41:51.100
Let's get him.

41:55.340 --> 41:58.710
I'll call you
if I need you.

41:58.710 --> 42:01.480
<i>[Jukebox]
 ¶ on the edge of love ¶</i>

42:01.480 --> 42:04.510
<i> ¶ knowing how easy
 it is to fall... ¶</i>

42:04.520 --> 42:06.320
don't wear
the black boots!

42:06.320 --> 42:08.690
Go earn me some money.

42:08.690 --> 42:14.060
<i> ¶ Hearts against
 the wall ¶</i>

42:14.060 --> 42:17.890
<i> ¶ here we stand,
 on the edge of love ¶</i>

42:17.900 --> 42:23.070
<i> ¶ knowing our dreams
 could be on the line ¶</i>

42:23.070 --> 42:27.000
<i> ¶ and running into truth
 and out of time... ¶¶</i>

42:27.010 --> 42:29.540
I beg your pardon,

42:29.540 --> 42:32.180
but you look like
my favorite actor.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.710
Are you
Richard gere?

42:33.710 --> 42:34.750
Here, have a seat.

42:34.750 --> 42:36.550
Oh, really?

42:36.550 --> 42:38.080
Have a seat.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.080
You like Richard gere?

42:40.090 --> 42:41.890
<i>I just love
Richard gere!</i>

42:41.890 --> 42:44.020
I could
introduce you to him.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.920
Don't play with me.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.890
We know each other
from the old neighborhood.

42:48.890 --> 42:52.360
You've got the finest legs
I have seen

42:52.360 --> 42:54.200
in this restaurant
tonight.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.770
You do something
with your hair.

42:56.770 --> 42:58.740
Oh, stop that!

42:58.740 --> 43:01.910
This hair makes
your eyes sing to me.

43:01.910 --> 43:04.110
Those eyes, those legs--

43:04.110 --> 43:06.740
you're an actress,
aren't you?

43:06.750 --> 43:08.880
Yes! How did
you know?

43:08.880 --> 43:10.780
The way you carry
yourself.

43:10.780 --> 43:12.380
Your body.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.120
Jane Fonda.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.920
Yes. Could you tell?

43:15.920 --> 43:18.220
I mean,
is it evident?

43:18.220 --> 43:20.390
You're working
on that body.

43:20.390 --> 43:22.790
Can I get you
a drink?

43:22.800 --> 43:25.400
Yes, I'd like
a cranberry juice

43:25.400 --> 43:27.600
with a Tequila shot.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.870
Cranberry juice
and a Tequila shot
for the lady.

43:36.780 --> 43:40.780
With a body like yours,
you have to be a star.

43:40.780 --> 43:43.080
I can't believe
you just--

43:43.080 --> 43:44.010
I am telling you.

43:48.790 --> 43:50.790
I tell you what.

43:50.790 --> 43:53.960
Finish this.
Take you to my place.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.960
I have some blow
that will set you free.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.000
What are you
talking about?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Blow. Flake. Buzz.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Colombian goo-goo dust.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.440
We'll do a few lines.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.840
I'll call
some people I know.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.670
I am telling you,

44:09.680 --> 44:12.440
you have a future
in this town.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.010
I feel it
in my bones.

44:15.010 --> 44:16.180
Stop!

44:16.180 --> 44:19.020
Trust me. This is
your lucky night.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.980
I'll open up a--

44:20.990 --> 44:22.820
you'll open up
something

44:22.820 --> 44:24.450
you don't
want to know.

44:24.460 --> 44:25.990
What is that?

44:25.990 --> 44:27.460
What?

44:27.460 --> 44:29.860
That.
Cold and hard.

44:29.860 --> 44:31.630
That.

44:31.630 --> 44:32.700
Cold and hard?

44:36.030 --> 44:37.470
Oh, that!

44:37.470 --> 44:38.500
That.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.970
That's rad.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.470
Rad?

44:41.470 --> 44:44.040
Mm-hmm. Conrad.
You're under arrest.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.640
Fuck you, lady!

44:45.640 --> 44:47.040
She's got a gun!

44:47.050 --> 44:48.480
Oh!

44:48.480 --> 44:50.050
Honey, get back!

44:50.050 --> 44:51.850
Let's go!

44:51.850 --> 44:54.050
Did you see it?

44:54.050 --> 44:55.490
Lady...

44:55.490 --> 44:57.020
Fuck! My ass!

44:57.020 --> 44:59.020
Don't be
such a crybaby.

44:59.020 --> 45:00.660
Give me your hand.

45:00.660 --> 45:02.030
What's wrong with you?

45:02.030 --> 45:04.330
Don't be
such a crybaby.

45:04.330 --> 45:06.900
Hello, boys.
I'm a police officer.

45:06.900 --> 45:09.870
Please take this gentleman
into the refrigerator

45:09.870 --> 45:12.670
and hang him up
with the sausages,

45:12.670 --> 45:14.170
if you don't mind.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.040
Come on,
help me, you guys.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.510
Ooh, cookies!

45:18.510 --> 45:20.040
Cookies! God!

45:20.050 --> 45:22.510
What's going on?

45:22.510 --> 45:23.910
Nothing.
Keep everybody cool.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.180
I'll talk
to you later.

45:26.180 --> 45:28.080
Have a cookie.
They're delicious.

45:28.090 --> 45:30.090
Oh, that's
wonderful!

45:30.090 --> 45:33.020
It's so hard
to find good help

45:33.030 --> 45:34.260
like you gentlemen.

45:34.260 --> 45:38.030
I want a doctor!
Get me a doctor!

45:38.030 --> 45:40.260
Why? It's only
a flesh wound.

45:40.270 --> 45:42.730
I'm bleeding!
I've been shot!

45:42.730 --> 45:45.100
I know, honey.
I shot you.

45:45.100 --> 45:46.900
Get me a doctor!

45:46.910 --> 45:48.940
I'm bleeding
to death!

45:48.940 --> 45:51.370
You're not going to
bleed to death.

45:51.380 --> 45:53.110
I'm not?

45:53.110 --> 45:54.780
No!

45:54.780 --> 45:56.780
You might freeze, but...

45:56.780 --> 45:57.950
Police.

45:57.950 --> 45:59.550
Narcotics.

45:59.550 --> 46:02.120
We got one guy in there.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.450
The other went out
the back. Hurry.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.960
Aah! Are you crazy?

46:12.970 --> 46:14.560
What's the matter,
honey?

46:14.570 --> 46:15.930
Jesus Christ, lady!

46:15.930 --> 46:18.130
Hang in there.

46:18.140 --> 46:20.300
What? What?

46:20.310 --> 46:22.940
Foot patrol is here.
You got five minutes.

46:22.940 --> 46:24.070
Ok.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.940
How's it going here?

46:25.940 --> 46:27.940
Fine. How's it going
out here?

46:27.950 --> 46:28.950
Ok.

46:28.950 --> 46:30.980
Is the food
any good?

46:30.980 --> 46:32.250
Yeah.

46:32.250 --> 46:34.320
Great. We'll
come back next week.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.950
Hurry up.

46:35.950 --> 46:37.150
Ok.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.120
Get me down
from here.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.990
Hey, who was that?

46:40.990 --> 46:43.990
Friends of mine
from the coroner's office.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.960
I invited them
to take your body

46:46.970 --> 46:48.430
in about 10 minutes.

46:48.430 --> 46:50.170
You could
alleviate all that

46:50.170 --> 46:51.630
by just simply giving.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.840
Give what?

46:55.970 --> 46:58.010
Fatal beauty.

46:58.010 --> 46:59.810
Fatal beauty?
Ha ha ha!

46:59.810 --> 47:01.010
This is funny, huh?

47:01.010 --> 47:03.180
Beats me.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.180
I beg your pardon?

47:05.180 --> 47:07.020
You overplayed it,
bitch.

47:07.020 --> 47:10.350
You're in some
serious shit now.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.190
You know, there's
two things in the world

47:13.190 --> 47:15.190
<i>I really hate--</i>

47:15.190 --> 47:17.290
a man
with funky underarms,

47:17.300 --> 47:20.030
and someone
who calls me a bitch.

47:20.030 --> 47:22.000
What do you think
you got?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.670
Try false arrest.

47:23.670 --> 47:25.640
And you try this.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.870
You try this.

47:27.870 --> 47:30.470
You killed a friend
of mine, charlene farr.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.010
You know her?

47:32.010 --> 47:34.210
Yeah!

47:34.210 --> 47:36.210
You gave her
bad dope.

47:36.210 --> 47:38.010
Yes, I did. Yes!

47:38.020 --> 47:41.020
Tell me
where you got it,

47:41.020 --> 47:43.690
or I'll
blow your nuts off.

47:43.690 --> 47:45.390
At a buy house

47:45.390 --> 47:47.320
on ramparts
and 13th street

47:47.330 --> 47:49.330
from a guy
named Raphael.

47:49.330 --> 47:52.030
I swear!
Don't shoot, ok?

47:52.030 --> 47:55.400
See? All you have to do
is be nice,

47:55.400 --> 47:58.670
and good things
come to you.

47:58.670 --> 48:00.240
Is that you?

48:00.240 --> 48:01.670
Y-y-yeah, yeah!

48:01.670 --> 48:04.040
Yeah, yeah,
that's it! Yeah!

48:04.040 --> 48:06.040
God, that's pitiful!

48:06.040 --> 48:08.850
It only feels
about that big.

48:08.850 --> 48:12.050
I'd really be pissed
if I were you.

48:12.050 --> 48:15.420
You gonna get me
down from here?

48:15.420 --> 48:17.420
¶ Jimmy on my mind ¶

48:17.420 --> 48:20.090
you gonna--
c-c-come on!

48:20.090 --> 48:21.860
¶ Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy ¶

48:21.860 --> 48:23.090

Come on, man!

48:59.230 --> 49:00.930
Get out of here!

49:00.930 --> 49:03.570
Get the fuck

Come on, move it!

49:08.470 --> 49:09.540
I'll pay you.

49:31.930 --> 49:34.160
I'm gonna pay you!

49:34.170 --> 49:35.770
Hey, man!

49:35.770 --> 49:37.000
Come on, man!

49:50.020 --> 49:51.610
Looking for something,
pretty one?

49:51.620 --> 49:53.950
Yeah. My friend
Jimmy silver

49:53.950 --> 49:57.020
told me
if I stood here,

49:57.020 --> 50:00.360
I might
meet somebody
named Raphael.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.630
Jimmy silvers?

50:03.630 --> 50:04.490
Oh, yeah!

50:04.500 --> 50:07.630
Runs a taco stand
over on bellflower.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.630
Runs a line of girls
out of Melrose.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.800
I take you in for 20--

50:13.810 --> 50:16.470

50:17.880 --> 50:19.810
Oh, yeah?

50:19.810 --> 50:21.480
Right this way.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.850
You're kind of cute.

50:22.850 --> 50:25.650
Next week,
I get you 40.

50:25.650 --> 50:27.820
What do I
have to do?

50:27.820 --> 50:29.390
I don't know,

50:29.390 --> 50:32.820
but it may be fun.

50:32.820 --> 50:34.490
She wants to
go in first.

50:34.490 --> 50:36.390
I know that bitch.

50:36.390 --> 50:38.360
<i>That chinga is heat, man</i>

50:38.360 --> 50:40.400
all right.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.230
Talk to you later.

50:44.340 --> 50:46.070
Ah!

50:46.070 --> 50:48.000
Look at them.

50:48.010 --> 50:50.210
They want it--
the cure!

50:50.210 --> 50:51.840
They want
fatal beauty!

50:51.840 --> 50:53.380
Hey, man,

50:53.380 --> 50:57.010

Inside--
she's black

50:57.020 --> 50:58.280
<i>and dressed
like a puta.</i>

[Coughing]

51:07.430 --> 51:08.660
[Sniffling]

51:27.110 --> 51:29.250
This baby's anxious.

51:29.250 --> 51:32.250
She paid extra
to go first.

51:32.250 --> 51:36.050
Grams cost 80.
5s and 10s only.

51:36.050 --> 51:37.520
I'll take a half.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.060
Move!

51:43.060 --> 51:44.160
Hey, man!

Pot's, right?

51:53.940 --> 51:55.570
Mm-hmm.

51:55.570 --> 51:56.910
You Raphael?

51:56.910 --> 51:58.470
Maybe.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.440
Why?

52:00.450 --> 52:04.080
I thought we could talk
about helping one another.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
Yeah, sure.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.120
You and every
other chick

52:07.120 --> 52:08.750
that comes in here.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.450
Just take the stuff
and blow.

52:11.460 --> 52:14.290
I'm not talking sex.

52:14.290 --> 52:16.660
I'm talking business.

52:16.660 --> 52:19.960
I'd like to buy
in quantity.
Ha!

52:19.960 --> 52:21.960
Can we discuss this

52:21.970 --> 52:24.100
without everyone
in the hallway hearing?

52:24.100 --> 52:26.500
Ha ha ha!

52:26.500 --> 52:28.500
I like your chain.

52:28.510 --> 52:29.670
Yeah.

52:32.510 --> 52:33.940
Yeah.

52:33.950 --> 52:35.010
Ok.

52:38.180 --> 52:40.020
It's going to be a minute.

52:41.690 --> 52:43.320
Ok, goldilocks, what--

52:43.320 --> 52:45.320
one word,

52:45.320 --> 52:48.990
and I'm going to
clear your sinuses.

52:48.990 --> 52:50.330
Move it, here!

52:50.330 --> 52:51.490
Hey!

52:51.500 --> 52:53.360
Let's go!

52:53.370 --> 52:55.200
What the hell's
goin' on?

52:57.140 --> 52:59.000
Ok, where's
the black bitch?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.200
In with Raphael.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.970
Yah!

53:04.980 --> 53:06.480
Argh! Uh!

53:06.480 --> 53:08.080
Uh! Uh!

53:10.550 --> 53:13.150
You're never getting
out of here, bitch.

53:13.150 --> 53:14.980
Not alive, anyhow.

53:14.990 --> 53:17.150
[Cocks gun]

53:17.160 --> 53:19.360
Neither are you,
unless you talk.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.390
Ha ha ha!

53:21.390 --> 53:24.360
Earl, Earl! Up to
the third floor,

53:24.360 --> 53:26.030
down
the fire escape.

53:26.030 --> 53:27.360
Hey,
where's he going?

53:27.370 --> 53:30.170
Now, who are you
fronting for?

53:30.170 --> 53:32.570
Some crazies just out
of vaccaville.

53:32.570 --> 53:34.000
Names.

53:34.010 --> 53:35.440
Hey, how should I--

53:37.740 --> 53:40.680
but I could tell you
where they are.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.010
Oh, yeah? Where?

53:42.010 --> 53:44.010
Ha.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.180
Right outside
that door,

53:46.180 --> 53:48.180
getting ready
to come in here

53:48.190 --> 53:50.650
and blow
your black ass away.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.870
No!

54:07.870 --> 54:08.940
Aah!

54:13.580 --> 54:14.940
Aah!

54:30.060 --> 54:32.460
What the hell
are you doing here?

54:32.460 --> 54:34.530
Oh, I've missed you, too,
rizzoli.

54:40.070 --> 54:42.470
How exactly
did you find me?

54:42.470 --> 54:44.610
Transmitter
under your bumper.

54:44.610 --> 54:46.540
I've been following you
since last night.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.150
That's a nice outfit.

54:55.090 --> 54:55.920
Oh, shit!

54:55.920 --> 54:57.620
This is great,
marshak.

54:57.620 --> 54:58.690
[Noise]

55:05.660 --> 55:07.100
Where'd
everybody go?

55:07.100 --> 55:10.170
Maybe they got a whiff
of your perfume.

55:13.470 --> 55:15.340
That's funny.

55:15.340 --> 55:18.010
Almost hysterical,
marshak.

55:22.650 --> 55:24.350
[Rats squeak]

55:34.130 --> 55:36.690
I've known you
one day, rizzoli.

55:36.690 --> 55:40.660
Already, my life
is passing
before my eyes.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.730
Trust me, marshak,
it's not a pretty sight.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.540
What are you
doing here, marshak?

55:53.180 --> 55:56.810
I'm here to collect
on my tire.

55:56.810 --> 55:58.680
What does it take

55:58.680 --> 56:01.320
to get on
a first-name basis with you?

56:01.320 --> 56:05.890
You might try minding
your own business
and not following me.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.230
Right now, following you
is my business.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.530
If you
don't like it,

56:14.530 --> 56:15.900
you could always
go home.

56:15.900 --> 56:18.730
I would, but my boss
worries about you.

56:18.740 --> 56:22.710
He's worried that
I'll find his drugs
before he does.

56:22.710 --> 56:28.180
Once I find them,
I'll look for him,
and I'll find him.

56:28.180 --> 56:31.710
If you fuck with me,
I'll find you, too.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.180
Bullshit.

56:45.430 --> 56:47.560

56:47.570 --> 56:49.730
Why? Scared
I'm going to

56:49.730 --> 56:51.930
find the drugs
before you?

56:51.940 --> 56:53.770
I'm telling you

56:53.770 --> 56:55.810
I don't know
anything about
any blow.

Are you all right?

58:45.880 --> 58:50.350
Yeah. I just
fell on my ass,
that's all.

All the fuck over.

This is father Martin
at Mary star of the sea.

59:52.780 --> 59:56.590

reading about detective rizzoli.

59:56.590 --> 59:59.590
The entire fourth grade
has written her a letter.

59:59.590 --> 01:00:02.660
But the article did not say
which hospital she--

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.630
oh, well,
thank you very much,

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:08.900
and God bless you, too.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.980
Sorry. I didn't know
you were busy.
I'll come back later.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.810
No, no, no,
no, no, stay.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.850

You know, marshak,

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.170
I'm not so good
at saying stuff,

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.840
but I have to
thank you.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.010
It's my job,
rizzoli.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.180
Yeah. So what
do you want?

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.850
What do you mean?

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:01.850
Why are you here?

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.950
I'm looking
for peace, rizzoli.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.460

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.990
Piece of what,
marshak?

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.290
Real nice, rizzoli.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.930
Why don't you just
open the package, huh?

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.540
Ain't nothin'
going to jump
out of here, is there?

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:35.670

followed you
that night.

really great.

Yeah.

I can't accept this.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.870
What do you mean,
can't accept it?

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:56.070
I said
I can't accept it.
Why not?

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:59.070
Because this is like
taking a bribe
from kroll.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.910
Hey, lady,
honest money
bought this dress.

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.710
What I do for kroll
is strictly legal.

You work for kroll.
Kroll sells dope.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.020
The money you make
is dope money.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.690
You bought this dress
with dope money.
Do you understand?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.430
Maybe I do,
maybe I don't.

Look, the man
pays my salary.

let it slide.

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.360
Yellow cab,
please.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.790
Hey.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.460
What's wrong?

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.630
Give me the number
to yellow cab.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.370
<i>You're what's wrong.</i>

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.200
People are sticking
shit up their nose,

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.470
and they're dying because
people let it slide.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.010
I got lunatics coming into
a goddamn hospital

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:13.010
to shooe me
over some bad drugs

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:14.840
because somebody
let it slide.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.880
You're what's wrong,
marshak.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.480
Get the fuck
away from me, ok?

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.020
<i> Dr. Madison,
 please call line one.</i>

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.050
Hey, rizzoli.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.820
Come on,
rizzoli.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.020
The world's
gone to shit,

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.690
but it isn't
all my fault!

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:31.030
Stay out of my face.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:34.400
What do you
want me to
do about it?

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.030
Nothing.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.330
Not a damn thing,
marshak.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.070
And you know why?
Because you're a coward.

01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:46.080
It's much safer
to let it slide, right?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.840
God help you
if you ever

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.710
have to take
a stand.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.250
I do what I have to.

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.880
You're getting fat,
kroll gets fatter,

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.850
and people
keep on dying.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.720
You listen!

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.090
You're an asshole,
and you're a coward.

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.290
Now fuck off.

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.710
Hey, rizzoli.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.080
Rizzoli!

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.280
Let me give you
a ride home.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:33.290
It's a two-hour
walk from here,
for chrissake.

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.090
Come on.

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:39.260
Let me give you
a ride home.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.730
I won't say
a God damn word.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.130
You won't
say anything?

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.730
Nothing?

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.970
Not a God damn word.
I'll just drive.

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.470
Oh, yeah.
I really believe that.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:07.920
¶ Mmmm ¶

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.130
¶ mm hmmm ¶

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:12.930
¶ mm mmm ¶¶

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.760
must you do that?

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.000
Hmm?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.570
Sorry.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.840
You look nice
tonight, rizzoli.

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:30.810
Do something different
with your hair?

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.380
Um-umm. Same--

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.780
damn.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:38.890
Tricky.
Very tricky.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.300
Sorry, rizzoli--

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.970
for being
such an asshole.

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:54.200
That's all right, marshak.
I'll get used to it.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.800
Bye.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.370
Yeah.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.540
Hey.
What?

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.040
What about
the dress?

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:03.550
No.
I told you I...

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.550
[Cat meows]

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.720
[Meow]

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:14.390
[Meow]

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.060
What's the matter,
rizzoli?

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.830
My cat's
on the roof.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.370
So, what, are you
going to shoot him?

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:26.370
No. But my door is open.
Cat's on the roof.

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.270
And my cat
hates heights.

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:41.920
He's one of my
many admirers.

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:45.290
Hey.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.090
What are you
doing here?

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:51.590
They're dead.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.100
They're all dead.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.030
<i> ¶ Red hot ¶</i>

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:59.900
<i> ¶ baby, you're red hot,
 red hot ¶</i>

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.970
<i> ¶ I need your love ¶¶</i>

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.120
Jesus.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.460
Jesus?

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.130
I mean, you let it slide,
right, marshak?

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.120
You want to tell me
what happened?

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.149
Well, um...

01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:51.920
We were just having
fun, that's all.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920
I mean...

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.090
We were just
kicking back,

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.330
and the party
was breaking up.

01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.930
And, um...

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.300
I had this coke.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:07.170
So we decided
to do it up.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:12.340
And it was supposed
to have this radical
buzz, right?

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:16.109
Anyway, I, um...

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.609
I decided
I wanted to

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:19.479
take a jump
in the pool first.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:22.380
And they started
without me.

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:29.859
I didn't know.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:37.399
Otherwise I'd be
just like them.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:46.380
Zack...
Where did you
get the stuff?

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.979
From cecile.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:50.810
Cecile?

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:52.979
Who's cecile?

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.550
She's my mom.

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.050
Match point,
cecile.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.720
In your face!

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.990
Great shot!
Good, cecile.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:06.500
Ha ha ha!

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.160
Better luck
next time, huh?

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.000
Congratulations,
Marty.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.400
How about
another set?

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.070
I have to go
up to the house.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.750
Hi, Cece. Did
you get him?

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.850
Whipped his
skinny butt.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.390
Excuse me,
Mrs. jaeger?

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:31.690
Deliveries
around back.

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.020
Mrs. jaeger, I'm
detective rizzoli.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.860
I'm with narcotics.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.430
I hardly mistook you
for a guest

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.260
in your undercover
suit by K-Mart.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.400
That's really,
really witty.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.570
This is about
your son.

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.870
What's he
done now?

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.400
He's over at detox.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.240
I hope they have
better luck.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.040
Excuse me,
Mrs. jaeger?

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040
Take your hand off.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.780
Excuse me.
My mistake.

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.410
Last night 10 of your
son's friends od'd.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.580
Your son says he got
the stuff from you.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.890
My son is
a congenital liar.

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:05.620
Tennis, Cece?

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.890
Sure.
10 minutes.

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:08.790
That's real motherly.

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:11.630
Your kid's in detox,
10 kids are dead,

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.800
and you're meeting her
in 10 minutes.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.300
I'm sorry
about my son.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.730
I'm sorry
about his friends.

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:18.900
Sure.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.140
I've done
everything I can.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.080
Excuse me.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.250
I hate to keep
bothering you
Mrs. jaeger, but...

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.650
There is more.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.650
Listen to me,
miss ravioli,

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.820
or whatever
your name is.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.090
You put your hand
on me one more time,

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:41.090
you'll wish to hell
you hadn't.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:43.760
You know,
you're right.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.460
Why don't you
just tell me

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.460
where you got
the stuff from?

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.170
Mrs. jaeger?

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.840
Now you get
out of my house!

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.940
Do you hear me?
Get out!

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.670
Ohh!

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.480
Now, Mrs. jaeger,
everybody knows

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.850
it's against the law
to hit a police officer.

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:07.620
I'm afraid you're
under arrest,

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.950
and I've got to read you
your rights. Understand?

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:12.850
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.690
You bitch!

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:16.360
Ow!

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.930
Oh, my God!

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:25.970
You have the right
to speak with an attorney

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.670
and to have an attorney
present during questioning.

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:32.140
Mrs. jaeger, I don't want
to arrest you.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.980
Just tell me where
you get your stuff,

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.140
and I'll leave
you alone.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.710
That's all
I need to know.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.350
Come on.

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:43.320
I'm sorry
about the window.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.160
I don't like disrupting
people's lives.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.560
Just tell me where
you buy your stuff.

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:54.960
You won't get away
with this! Are you--

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.900
what is your problem?!

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.340
I come over here
to tell you about your kid,
and what do you do?

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.840
God damn!
Get your hands off me!

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.740
You throw crap
at me.

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.410
Excuse me,
excuse me.

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:12.180
Shit, Rita,
what are you doing?

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.680
Thank you.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.920
Hit her! Hit her!
Take her. Go.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.620
Ow!

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.590
I can't let you go
anywhere without me.

01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:26.930
Somebody get her!
Don't let her go!

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:28.630
Well, get her!
Don't let--

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:33.670
damn, marshak.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.780
I cannot believe that I
hit this woman that way.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.940
I can't believe
that you would
encourage me to do that.

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:45.810
I think
she needed hitting.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.050
You want some coffee?

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.120
Yeah, thanks.

01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:57.230
Make yourself
at home.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.030
Thank you.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.770
Hey, how do you take
your coffee?

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:07.840
Black.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:10.310
Oh.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.660
[Telephone rings]

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.890
Hello?

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.870
When?

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.710
Yeah, uh...

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.920
Yeah, you call.

01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:58.720
No, you do it.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.920
All right.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.340
Just let me have
some coffee,

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.940
and I'll be fine.

01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:22.840
Maybe you'd rather have
some juice, huh?

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:24.880
You want juice?
Coffee's fine.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.880
All right. We'll
make coffee.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.490
Or something to drink,
maybe whiskey?

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.560
Rizzoli,
what's the matter?
Nothing!

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.730
I'll just make you
a drink.

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.890
Mom always told me
to be a good host.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.500
You want a drink?
Just tell me what you want.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.900
I know how to
take care of people.
I'm real good at this.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.910
Take your glass--
I don't want a drink,
rizzoli.

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:52.710
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:55.910
I'll get you
some coffee.

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:57.710
It's no big deal.

01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:00.520
I just want you to know
you're welcome in my house,

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.020
and how pleased I am
that you're kind enough

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.920
to come all this way
with me,

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.590
because you think
I'm a nice person
and pretty responsible.

01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:11.390
So what do I do?
You want me to go?

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.190
No, I-I don't
want you to go.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.760
I just want to know
what's happening.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.260
What's going on?
Talk to me.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.210
I got four dead kids
at the grammar school.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:29.110
8, 9, 10, and 12.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.110
Dead by fatal beauty.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.380
I guess they wanted me

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:38.550
to call his mother
and tell her,

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.760
but I can't, you know.
I don't know what to say.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.230
Because I'm kind of
responsible

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.900
for trying to get this stuff
off the streets.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.400
You know, every time
I take one out...

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.970
Every time I think
I'm this close,

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.910
I got more people...
Gone, you know.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.440
I got little kids dying,
I got fucking teenagers,

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.650
and adults and old people
and everybody.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.980
But I just don't know
what to do, man.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.980
I'm really tired.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:13.990
So what are you
going to do?

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.260
Be a quitter?

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.260
You blame yourself?

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.990
You're going to accept
the responsibility

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.430
for all that shit
out there or what?

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.900
Now, please.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.610
Don't talk to me
about responsibility.

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.810
Because I'm responsible,
you know.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:37.610
You want to talk
about stuff like this?

01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:38.810
I'll tell you, man.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:42.020
I was not
a pretty kid.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.990
I knew that.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:47.190
My mother never
let me forget,

01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:48.860
because I come
from pretty people.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.490
People who don't say boo.
But I fucked up.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:58.300
I had a baby.
Didn't have no husband.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.040
Didn't even have an "o"
after the number.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.970
Just one-four.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.710
You know, I was 14,

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:06.210
I started going out
with this guy

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:11.980
who I found out
went out with me
on a dare.

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:13.980
[Sighs]

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.850
I don't think
I ever got over that.

01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:21.660
I couldn't see no way
to get people to like me.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.860
And then I discovered
drugs.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.900
Now, drugs,
I could hang out.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.870
I could party,
I could dance,

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:33.870
I could go to bed
with people,

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:35.240
I could be funny,

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.070
I could be pretty,
you know?

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:39.910
And I thought,
nirvana.

01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.880
I found nirvana,
you know.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.880
And I did them
for a long time.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.020
And this pretty little baby
kind of kept growing
and got cute.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.690
Oh, man, she was so sweet.
All she did was hug.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.190
She'd hug you and say,
"I love you."

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.100
That's all she did.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.770
But when you're high,
it doesn't matter,

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:04.930
you know?

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.900
And I came in one day
after making a run,

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:12.570
and I get in and my stash
was gone through.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.780
And I'm looking around,
and it didn't occur to me

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.910
that there was something
else wrong in the house.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.780
Ok, I'm looking
for the stuff,

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.550
and it's
all over the floor.

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:28.060
My shit is gone.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.920
Then the phone rings.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:32.930
It's a guy
down at the pool,

01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:38.970
calling me to tell me
that my...Daughter...

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:42.740
Was dead...

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:46.810
Because she got
into my shit.

01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:50.810
When I think back now,

01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:53.250
I think of all these
little kids, you know,

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:57.090
who don't want anything
but to...To be looked at

01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:01.820
as somebody special,
somebody worthwhile.

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.160
You want to tell them
this ain't the way,

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.000
but you can't, because
they don't listen.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.800
They don't fucking
listen, man.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.330
So they just keep dying.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.400
Oh, rizzoli.

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:17.810
It's ok.

01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:20.240
It's ok, baby.

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:30.080
It's okay.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.530

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.460
[Telephone rings]

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.200
Hey, marshak.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:48.140
Yoo-hoo! Can you get
the phone for me, please?

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:51.040
<i> Hi, it's Rita. If you
 have a message,</i>

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.010
<i> leave it
 after the tone.</i>

01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:54.840
Hey, marshak!

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.650
<i> Rizzoli, I've talked
 to captain McKay.</i>

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:00.050
<i> He didn't mind you
blowing away that scumbag...
Mike?</i>

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:04.850
<i> Or hanging the pimp up
 in some meat locker...</i>

01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:07.320
Mike?

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.190
<i> But when you invade
 a woman's home</i>

 in front of her guests,</i>

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:16.030
<i> you've gone too damn far.
 He wants to see you now.</i>

01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:18.100

 telling you, rizzoli--</i>

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.500
[telephone rings]

01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:24.870
Hello?

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:27.840
Detective rizzoli,
sorry to bother you.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.040
This is cecile jaeger,
Zack's mother.

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:31.680
How'd you get
this number?

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.050
At the detoxification center.

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.720
It's about Zack.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.420
What happened?

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.850
He...Well...

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.890
They're ready.
I'll be right here.

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.220
I'd better go.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.260
What happened?

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.060
He cut his wrists
last night.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.730
Could you come
down here? Please?

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.930
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.360
Good evening, ma'am.
Excuse me, please.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.930
Thank you for coming.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.740
How's he doing?

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.400
They don't know yet.

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.140
One break--at least
we have the same blood type.

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:35.810
I was...

01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:40.280
The reason I called
is...Is I want to help.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.820
Hmm. You really
want to help?

01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:50.960
Tell me who
you buy from.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.190
Have a seat.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.330
His name
is Denny miflin.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.170
A young man,
attractive, blond.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.010
Know where I can
find him tonight?

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:10.780
He'll be at kroll Plaza
tonight about 7:00.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.780
He always wears
a white turtleneck.

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.020
Anything else?

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.620
Yes. He'll be
making a pickup

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.520
from his suppliers
tonight.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.620
They'll do it
in some store.

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.360
I don't know
how they work.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.800
Thank you very much.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.960
Keep me posted, huh?

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:32.170
I will.

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.900
You've been terrific.

01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:39.540
Yeah.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.610
Terrific.

come and get some balloons

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.460
You better go get that blow
from those kids, Carl.

It's rizzoli.

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:32.390
Will you be
all right?

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.690
Yeah, but hurry.

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.930
And, for God's sakes,
take off that tie.

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.600
Mr. kroll had better know.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.270
See what her friend
is up to.

01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:48.110
Out of the way!

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.450

Huh?

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:01.920
Give me the dope.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.960
Give me the drugs!

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.300
Do you like my tie?

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.900
Mm-hmm.
Uh-uh.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.900
Don't make me
repeat myself.
Do you like my tie?

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.730
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.140
Get out of here!

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:24.350
Ah!

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:29.450
Uh-huh.

01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:30.990
Something's going on.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.660
Maybe I know
what it is.

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.460
Those two guys
from the mug shots

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.960
just came out
of LA baguette.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.930
Nova and Skinner.

01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:43.130
It's got to be.

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:44.300
Take them out.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:48.940
Try to avoid trouble
if you can.

01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.770
Go, Marty.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.840
Her, too.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.480
You got a problem, Mike?

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.550
No.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.180
I got no problem.

01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.710
Excuse me.

01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:30.210
Now.

Hey, what an asshole!

Let's see the stuff.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:30.070
Denny, let's see
that stuff.

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.870
Check it out.

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:34.440

Count it.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.580
All right, Leo?

Here's 20.

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.720
Uh--

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.690
don't make a sound,
or we're both dead.

God damn it.
