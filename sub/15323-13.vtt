WEBVTT

00:00.202 --> 00:01.470
HOW DO WE CONNECT KARSTEN
WITH THE MURDER

00:01.470 --> 00:04.409
WITH NO HARD EVIDENCE?
YOU'RE THE FIXER. FIX IT.

00:04.409 --> 00:05.910
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:09.270 --> 00:10.605
NICE FALL.

00:10.605 --> 00:12.106
WELL DONE, JACK.

00:12.106 --> 00:13.508
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING
IS MY FAULT.

00:13.508 --> 00:15.143
NO, IT ISN'T.

00:15.143 --> 00:17.178
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

00:27.488 --> 00:30.892
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

00:57.051 --> 00:59.887
SARA, MY NAME'S ROBERT.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.722
I'M A DOCTOR.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.724
THERE'S AN AMBULANCE
ON THE WAY.

01:16.871 --> 01:18.639
SATS ONLY 82.
B.P.'s DROPPING.

01:18.639 --> 01:21.642
I'M GONNA NEED
A LARYNGEAL AIRWAY.

01:38.426 --> 01:43.931
SARA, SARA, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

01:43.931 --> 01:45.833
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
SARA.

02:04.218 --> 02:06.554
FREEZE!

02:06.554 --> 02:07.722
HANDS IN THE AIR!

02:07.722 --> 02:08.856
HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!

02:08.856 --> 02:10.591
HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!
DON'T MOVE!

02:10.591 --> 02:12.126
PLEASE MOVE SOUTH
ON LaSALLE, PEOPLE.

02:12.126 --> 02:14.128
WELL,
DID SHE GO OUTSIDE?

02:14.128 --> 02:15.563
I-I DON'T KNOW.

02:18.532 --> 02:20.401
SARA?

02:20.401 --> 02:22.937
SARA!

02:27.108 --> 02:29.944
HEY, GET OFF ME!

02:29.944 --> 02:31.445
WE GOT THE SON OF A BITCH,
CAPTAIN!

02:31.445 --> 02:33.381
HEY, LET ME GO!
LET ME GO!

02:33.381 --> 02:35.416
HEY!

-- Captions by VITAC --

02:57.805 --> 02:59.507
SIR?

03:01.509 --> 03:03.010
HOW IS SHE?

03:03.010 --> 03:05.012
MR. STAFFORD, LET US GET HER
SETTLED IN HER ROOM,

03:05.012 --> 03:06.514
AND I'LL BE OUT
TO TALK TO YOU, OKAY?

03:06.514 --> 03:08.182
JUST ANSWER ME.
IS SHE OKAY?

03:08.182 --> 03:09.917
BULLET TRAVELED
STRAIGHT THROUGH HER CHEST.

03:09.917 --> 03:12.953
HEART AND SPINE WERE SPARED,
BUT TORE A MAJOR ARTERY.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.288
YOU CAN FIX THAT,
RIGHT?

03:14.288 --> 03:17.325
WE CAN. WE DID.
BUT SHE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

03:17.325 --> 03:18.626
IT WILL BE AWHILE
BEFORE WE KNOW

03:18.626 --> 03:20.961
WHETHER OR NOT HER BRAIN
TOOK A HIT.
"TOOK A HIT"?

03:20.961 --> 03:22.129
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

03:22.129 --> 03:24.298
JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE,
AND I'LL BE OUT TO EXPLAIN.

03:24.298 --> 03:26.467
EXPLAIN IT TO ME NOW.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.470
HER BRAIN WAS POSSIBLY
DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.340
WHETHER OR NOT SHE SUFFERED
ANY PERMANENT DAMAGE...

03:32.340 --> 03:36.043
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

03:36.043 --> 03:37.345
CHECK A CRIT Q 15.

03:37.345 --> 03:40.014
<i> BLUE TEAM TO ICU, PLEASE.</i>
<i>BLUE TEAM, ICU.</i>

03:45.853 --> 03:49.323
JACK, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:49.323 --> 03:51.025
ELAINE --
WHAT?

03:51.025 --> 03:52.960
WHAT DID HE DO?

03:52.960 --> 03:56.397
VIC -- HE SHOT SOMEONE.

03:56.397 --> 03:57.732
WHAT?

03:57.732 --> 03:59.800
HE SHOT SARA.
HE TRIED TO KILL HER.

05:00.094 --> 05:02.763
I REMEMBER
ONE OF OUR FIRST DATES.

05:02.763 --> 05:06.100
YOU, UM --
YOU DARED ME

05:06.100 --> 05:08.803
TO GO ON A POLAR SWIM
IN THE LAKE.

05:08.803 --> 05:12.740
YOU COUNTED TO THREE,
AND YOU JUMPED IN.

05:12.740 --> 05:15.910
I JUST --
I STOOD THERE.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.745
AND YOU ACTUALLY DID IT.

05:17.745 --> 05:20.381
YOU WERE SO MAD AT ME.

05:20.381 --> 05:25.553
BUT I REMEMBER THINKING...
"WOW.

05:25.553 --> 05:30.991
THIS GIRL IS TOUGHER
THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE."

05:36.964 --> 05:38.866
DO THAT AGAIN.

05:42.102 --> 05:45.272
THAT'S GOOD.

05:45.272 --> 05:47.775
THAT'S REAL GOOD.
OKAY, HOLD ON.

05:47.775 --> 05:48.843
DOCTOR!

05:48.843 --> 05:50.444
MY WIFE'S WAKING UP.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.116
THE GRAND JURY
IS GOING TO INDICT YOU.

05:56.116 --> 05:58.118
THEY'RE DELIBERATING.

05:58.118 --> 05:59.687
THEY ARE NOT
DELIBERATING.

05:59.687 --> 06:02.022
A GOOD PROSECUTOR
CAN GET A GRAND JURY

06:02.022 --> 06:04.492
TO INDICT A HAM SANDWICH.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.827
DREW STAFFORD
IS A GOOD PROSECUTOR.

06:06.827 --> 06:09.296
I PAY YOU A LOT OF MONEY.
FIX IT.

06:09.296 --> 06:14.301
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.
MIKOLAJ IS COOPERATING.

06:14.301 --> 06:16.770
HE SAID YOU ORDERED
THE HIT ON JACK.

06:16.770 --> 06:19.974
NOW, THAT'S GONNA ADD CHARGES
TO THE INDICTMENT --

06:19.974 --> 06:23.477
SOLICITATION OF MURDER,
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER.

06:23.477 --> 06:27.815
IF THEY COME,
I WANT YOU TO ARRANGE

06:27.815 --> 06:29.750
A DIGNIFIED WAY
FOR ME TO SURRENDER.

06:31.785 --> 06:36.757
AND I'M GONNA NEED SOME TIME
TO HANDLE THINGS.

06:50.738 --> 06:53.374
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:53.374 --> 06:55.376
UH, NO, I'M OKAY.

06:55.376 --> 06:57.378
WHO ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE?

06:57.378 --> 07:00.314
HER.

07:00.314 --> 07:03.817
SARA, I'M DR. HOFFMAN.

07:03.817 --> 07:05.553
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW?

07:05.553 --> 07:08.589
A HOSPITAL.

07:08.589 --> 07:10.891
YOU KNOW
WHO THIS GUY IS?

07:10.891 --> 07:15.362
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

07:24.538 --> 07:28.542
HAVE A SEAT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU CAN GO IN.

07:28.542 --> 07:31.879
OH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, I SHOULD GO.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.480
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.210
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

07:50.210 --> 07:53.013
QUINCY THERINGER, FBI.

07:53.013 --> 07:54.214
PENDING FURTHER NOTICE,

07:54.214 --> 07:56.283
ALL KARSTEN ALLIED ASSETS
ARE BEING FROZEN,

07:56.283 --> 07:58.351
AND THESE OFFICES
ARE CLOSED FOR BUSINESS.

07:58.351 --> 08:00.053
YOU NEED TO SEND
YOUR STAFF HOME.

08:00.053 --> 08:02.222
HAVE THEY COME HERE
TO HUMILIATE ME?

08:02.222 --> 08:04.224
NOT AT ALL, SIR.
THIS IS UNREASONABLE.

08:04.224 --> 08:05.892
HE HASN'T EVEN BEEN
INDICTED YET.

08:05.892 --> 08:08.061
CORRECTION, COUNSELOR.
HE HAS.

08:08.061 --> 08:11.798
IT'S JUICY READING --
LOTS OF BAD THINGS.

08:11.798 --> 08:13.633
AM I UNDER ARREST?

08:13.633 --> 08:15.969
THE U.S. ATTORNEY,
AGAINST MY ADVICE,

08:15.969 --> 08:18.638
IS GRANTING YOU 24 HOURS
TO SURRENDER YOURSELF.

08:18.638 --> 08:21.808
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL BE SURVEILLING YOU.

08:21.808 --> 08:24.478
STRAY MORE THAN 10 MILES
FROM THE CITY CENTER

08:24.478 --> 08:26.980
OR PUT YOURSELF
INTO ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

08:26.980 --> 08:29.649
THAT ARE SUSPICIOUS,
AND WE WILL SWOOP IN

08:29.649 --> 08:32.819
AND HAUL YOU AWAY
LIKE A RUN-OF-THE-MILL CROOK.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.668
HI, POP.

08:48.668 --> 08:51.505
D.J.

08:51.505 --> 08:54.274
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE HERE.

08:54.274 --> 08:55.942
I WANTED TO TALK TO...

08:57.244 --> 08:59.279
MAY I COME IN?

09:02.182 --> 09:06.019
I KNOW THEY'RE ARRESTING YOU.
I HEARD.

09:06.019 --> 09:09.022
YEAH.

09:09.022 --> 09:11.024
THERE'S GONNA BE
A TRIAL.

09:11.024 --> 09:12.859
I'LL PROBABLY WIND UP
GOING TO JAIL.

09:12.859 --> 09:15.695
I'M NOT SURE
FOR HOW LONG.

09:15.695 --> 09:18.698
YOU BEAT HIM BEFORE.
YOU -- YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.

09:18.698 --> 09:21.201
IN THE MEANTIME,
I SET UP A TRUST FUND

09:21.201 --> 09:22.502
FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER.

09:22.502 --> 09:24.671
THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THERE
FOR THE BOTH OF YOU

09:24.671 --> 09:26.339
AND FOR THE KIDS, TOO.

09:26.339 --> 09:28.375
ELAINE'S GONNA BE
THE TRUSTEE.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.443
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS?

09:30.443 --> 09:32.612
SHE'S IN CHARGE.

09:32.612 --> 09:34.681
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:34.681 --> 09:38.018
BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED,

09:38.018 --> 09:41.521
SHE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT...

09:41.521 --> 09:43.790
UNTIL I GET OUT.

09:47.661 --> 09:49.563
LAINIE...

09:52.699 --> 09:55.702
I'M SO SORRY.

09:55.702 --> 09:58.638
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

09:58.638 --> 10:00.974
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

10:00.974 --> 10:04.744
I NEVER
WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:04.744 --> 10:06.513
GET OUT!

10:16.189 --> 10:18.858
YOU CAN TRY AGAIN,

10:18.858 --> 10:22.462
ONCE THINGS SETTLE DOWN.

10:43.883 --> 10:45.885
IS IT TRUE, POP?

10:47.887 --> 10:51.224
DID YOU TRY
AND HAVE JACK KILLED?

10:51.224 --> 10:54.894
IT'S, UH...

10:54.894 --> 10:57.097
IT'S COMPLICATED.

10:57.097 --> 10:59.432
PEOPLE
ARE COMPLICATED --

10:59.432 --> 11:04.304
THE THINGS THEY DO,
WHY THEY DO THEM.

11:04.304 --> 11:08.975
I UNDERSTAND
COMPLICATED THINGS, POP,

11:08.975 --> 11:10.877
MORE THAN YOU MAY THINK.

11:19.185 --> 11:21.855
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOUR SISTER.

11:46.513 --> 11:48.548
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

11:52.385 --> 11:54.554
I, UH...

11:54.554 --> 11:58.525
I WON'T BE ABLE TO VISIT YOU
ANYMORE AFTER THIS.

11:58.525 --> 12:00.493
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:00.493 --> 12:04.497
WE'RE PETITIONING THE COURT
TO HAVE YOU TRANSFERRED

12:04.497 --> 12:07.000
TO A PSYCHIATRIC
YOUTH FACILITY.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.868
YOU CAN'T.

12:08.868 --> 12:12.505
I'M 17 --
AN ADULT UNDER THE LAW.

12:12.505 --> 12:17.210
WELL,
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THAT.

12:21.781 --> 12:27.454
LOOK, VIC. THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

12:27.454 --> 12:29.322
I LET YOU DOWN.

12:32.459 --> 12:37.464
I TAUGHT YOU SOME THINGS
THAT WERE WRONG --

12:37.464 --> 12:40.133
VERY WRONG --

12:40.133 --> 12:43.303
THAT PROBABLY LED YOU
TO BEING IN HERE.

12:45.138 --> 12:47.807
AND FOR THAT...

12:47.807 --> 12:51.010
I AM TRULY SORRY.

12:53.346 --> 12:59.686
YOU TOLD ME ONCE...
TO NEVER APOLOGIZE.

12:59.686 --> 13:04.324
WELL, THAT WAS
ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

13:29.516 --> 13:31.351
JACK...

13:31.351 --> 13:33.219
HAVE YOU COME
TO FINISH THE JOB?

13:33.219 --> 13:35.722
JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES.

13:35.722 --> 13:38.024
I WANT TO EXPLAIN ABOUT --
EXPLAIN WHAT?

13:38.024 --> 13:41.361
I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,
BUT I'M GONNA GET VIC SOME HELP.

13:41.361 --> 13:43.363
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR HELP,

13:43.363 --> 13:45.899
VIC WOULD BE HOME
RIGHT NOW.

13:45.899 --> 13:47.801
AND IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR HELP,

13:47.801 --> 13:50.136
MY PARENTS
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

13:50.136 --> 13:53.239
YOUR PARENTS' DEATH
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

13:53.239 --> 13:57.043
MY FOREMAN CUT SOME CORNERS
WITH THE SCAFFOLDING.

13:57.043 --> 13:58.545
THE JOINTS FROZE UP
IN THE COLD.

13:58.545 --> 13:59.813
IT WAS WINDY.

13:59.813 --> 14:03.650
SO YOU TOOK ME IN,
AND THAT MAKES UP FOR IT?

14:03.650 --> 14:04.918
NO.

14:06.319 --> 14:08.988
BUT I'M STANDING HERE

14:08.988 --> 14:12.759
BECAUSE REPAIRING MY MISTAKES
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

14:12.759 --> 14:14.594
YEAH.

14:14.594 --> 14:17.263
WELL, YOU MIGHT
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT

14:17.263 --> 14:20.433
BEFORE YOU SENT THAT GUY
TO KILL ME.

15:04.444 --> 15:05.778
ARE THEY HERE?

15:05.778 --> 15:08.781
ON THEIR WAY UP.

15:11.985 --> 15:17.156
I'LL JUST --
JUST BE A MINUTE.

15:30.737 --> 15:32.639
IT'S TIME.
IS HE IN THERE?

15:44.083 --> 15:47.887
MR. KARSTEN,
COULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR?

15:49.889 --> 15:54.060
MR. KARSTEN!

15:54.060 --> 15:57.730
HE LOCKED IT.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

16:04.370 --> 16:06.072
OH, GOD. BUST IT DOWN.

16:06.072 --> 16:07.507
BUST IT DOWN!

16:35.440 --> 16:39.070
MY FATHER
WASN'T A RELIGIOUS MAN,

16:39.070 --> 16:43.241
BUT WHEN I LEARNED
THAT HIS FRIENDS FROM TROJKOVO

16:43.241 --> 16:45.076
WANTED TO PAY TRIBUTE
TO HIM HERE,

16:45.076 --> 16:48.646
IT, UH, SOMEHOW MADE SENSE.

16:50.582 --> 16:54.719
COMMUNITY, FAMILY, LOYALTY --

16:54.719 --> 16:58.923
THIS WAS HIS RELIGION.
THIS IS WHAT HE BELIEVED IN.

16:58.923 --> 17:05.196
I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY LIFE
BEING ANGRY AT MY FATHER.

17:05.196 --> 17:09.434
HE DID SOME BAD THINGS.
BUT --

17:09.434 --> 17:11.436
AND I FORGET
WHO FIRST SAID THIS --

17:11.436 --> 17:16.541
UM, "FORGIVENESS
IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE STRONG."

17:18.443 --> 17:20.678
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT MY FATHER DID WELL,

17:20.678 --> 17:26.117
IT WAS TO RAISE
ME AND MY BROTHER TO BE STRONG.

17:28.086 --> 17:33.258
SO...

17:33.258 --> 17:36.794
TO HONOR MY FATHER TODAY,
I FORGIVE HIM.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.964
YOU KNOW, HE SPENT HIS LIFE
DESPERATELY WORKING

17:39.964 --> 17:42.300
TOWARDS THIS DREAM
OF MAKING IT BIG,

17:42.300 --> 17:43.801
MAKING HIS MARK ON THE WORLD,

17:43.801 --> 17:49.674
BUT THE TRUE LEGACY
THAT WE LEAVE IS OUR CHILDREN...

17:51.909 --> 17:53.911
...AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN.

17:56.914 --> 18:01.586
THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS.

18:01.586 --> 18:04.722
IT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO GET IT RIGHT.

18:08.626 --> 18:11.296
ALL RIGHT, NOW.
INVALID COMING THROUGH.

18:11.296 --> 18:12.597
DON'T COME IN
THE KITCHEN.

18:12.597 --> 18:14.832
I HAVE A SURPRISE.
OKAY.

18:14.832 --> 18:18.236
WELL, I HAD NO IDEA
WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

18:18.236 --> 18:20.838
WOULD BE THIS HARD.
GIVE IT TIME.

18:26.077 --> 18:28.513
YOU WENT TO THE FUNERAL?

18:28.513 --> 18:29.614
YEAH.

18:29.614 --> 18:31.783
WHAT A MESS.
I ACTUALLY FELT BAD FOR THEM.

18:31.783 --> 18:32.817
YEAH.

18:32.817 --> 18:35.153
SO, LISTEN,
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE

18:35.153 --> 18:37.322
UNTIL YOU'RE BACK
ON YOUR FEET.

18:37.322 --> 18:38.656
WHICH SHOULDN'T BE
TOO LONG.

18:38.656 --> 18:40.892
AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU NEED.

18:42.627 --> 18:45.129
DREW...

18:45.129 --> 18:47.198
SORRY.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.436
BON APPéTIT.

18:51.436 --> 18:52.603
WHAT IS THIS?

18:52.603 --> 18:53.938
CINNAMON TOAST.

18:53.938 --> 18:56.808
DADDY SHOWED ME HOW TO MAKE IT
ALL BY MYSELF.

18:56.808 --> 19:00.278
OH, WELL,
THANKS, LOVE BUG!

19:00.278 --> 19:04.215
MM!
THIS IS PERFECT.

19:05.516 --> 19:08.019
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.
WE'RE TRACKING YOU.

19:08.019 --> 19:10.355
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WATCHING AND TRACKING?

19:10.355 --> 19:11.856
WHAT HE MEANS
TO SAY IS,

19:11.856 --> 19:13.691
THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP
IS IMPRESSED.

19:13.691 --> 19:15.059
WE KNOW YOU HAVE
POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS.

19:15.059 --> 19:17.061
WE THINK THAT NOW
IS YOUR MOMENT.

19:17.061 --> 19:19.530
I'VE CERTAINLY THOUGHT ABOUT
RUNNING FOR STATE'S ATTORNEY.

19:19.530 --> 19:20.865
NO, NO!
FORGET STATE'S ATTORNEY.

19:20.865 --> 19:22.867
I'M TALKING
U.S. CONGRESS.

19:22.867 --> 19:23.935
WHAT?

19:23.935 --> 19:25.603
WE HAVE A VACANT SEAT
IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT,

19:25.603 --> 19:27.271
AND YOU'RE
OUR MOST VIABLE CANDIDATE.

19:27.271 --> 19:30.608
YOU'RE INSANE.
NO, NO. WE'RE METHODICAL.

19:30.608 --> 19:32.877
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH.
WE THINK YOU CAN WIN.

19:32.877 --> 19:35.580
YOU'RE SMART, GOOD-LOOKING,
BROUGHT DOWN ONE OF CHICAGO'S

19:35.580 --> 19:37.582
MOST NOTORIOUS
CRIMINALS.

19:37.582 --> 19:40.718
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR YOUR ENTIRE CAREER.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.687
THE TIMING'S COMPLICATED.

19:42.687 --> 19:45.690
WELL, IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO YOUR WIFE'S AFFAIR...

19:45.690 --> 19:47.225
WELL, WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THAT.

19:47.225 --> 19:50.061
I SAY WE OWN IT,
DISPENSE WITH IT UP FRONT,

19:50.061 --> 19:51.863
MOVE ON
TO THE REAL ISSUES.

19:51.863 --> 19:54.365
YOU DO REALIZE WE'RE IN
THE PROCESS OF GETTING DIVORCED?

19:54.365 --> 19:56.000
YOU'RE NOT
DIVORCED YET.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.370
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN FILED
THE PAPERS, SO DON'T.

19:59.370 --> 20:01.539
METHODICAL, REMEMBER?

20:09.046 --> 20:11.682
HE TOLD ME
THERE'S A GIRL IN HIS CLASS

20:11.682 --> 20:12.917
WITH A CRUSH ON HIM.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.619
WOULDN'T TELL ME
HER NAME.

20:14.619 --> 20:19.357
A CRUSH? ALREADY?

20:19.357 --> 20:24.028
HE STILL LOOKS SO SMALL
WHEN HE SLEEPS.

20:28.032 --> 20:30.735
SO...

20:30.735 --> 20:35.239
I'VE BEEN APPROACHED
ABOUT RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

20:35.239 --> 20:37.241
REALLY?

20:37.241 --> 20:40.745
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

20:42.213 --> 20:44.882
THEY'RE HOPING
THAT I HAVE YOU

20:44.882 --> 20:48.386
UP ONSTAGE WITH ME
DURING CAMPAIGN EVENTS.

20:48.386 --> 20:52.390
I SAID THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND OUR DIVORCE IS PENDING.

20:52.390 --> 20:56.227
AND THEY SAID,
"WHAT DIVORCE?"

20:57.428 --> 21:01.032
YOU NEVER FILED
THE PAPERWORK.

21:04.635 --> 21:06.604
YEAH, WELL...

21:06.604 --> 21:08.940
I'M JUST NOT SURE
THAT I WANT TO GO BACK

21:08.940 --> 21:12.109
TO MOVING OUT
EVERY THREE DAYS.

21:12.109 --> 21:13.778
DO YOU?

21:13.778 --> 21:15.780
NO.

21:15.780 --> 21:17.949
BUT IT CAN'T BE
ALL ABOUT OLIVER.

21:17.949 --> 21:20.685
THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD
FOR ANY OF US.

21:20.685 --> 21:23.688
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

21:23.688 --> 21:28.192
I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN TRUST
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW

21:28.192 --> 21:33.130
OR WHAT YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT FEEL.

21:33.130 --> 21:37.735
I DON'T KNOW
IF EITHER OF US CAN.

21:39.170 --> 21:44.208
BUT WE -- WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
ALL OF THE ANSWERS NOW.

21:44.208 --> 21:47.378
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO BE UP ONSTAGE WITH YOU,

21:47.378 --> 21:51.215
BY YOUR SIDE,
JUST SAY, AND I'LL DO IT.

21:51.215 --> 21:55.553
IT'S YOUR DREAM.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

22:03.694 --> 22:05.863
YEAH, STAFFORD!

22:05.863 --> 22:08.366
ELECT ME TO REPRESENT
THE FIFTH DISTRICT IN WASHINGTON

22:08.366 --> 22:11.903
AND I WILL FIGHT
FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS STATE,

22:11.903 --> 22:14.572
FOR OUR CHILDREN,

22:14.572 --> 22:17.408
FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.

22:17.408 --> 22:19.210
THAT IS WHAT MATTERS.

22:19.210 --> 22:20.645
THAT IS OUR LEGACY.

22:22.346 --> 22:24.916
IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR WIFE
WAS ROMANTICALLY LINKED

22:24.916 --> 22:27.184
TO THATCHER CARSON'S
MARRIED SON-IN-LAW

22:27.184 --> 22:28.185
WHILE YOU
WERE PROSECUTING --

22:28.185 --> 22:30.021
MY OPPONENT
IS PRETTY DESPERATE

22:30.021 --> 22:32.690
IF THAT'S THE BEST
HE CAN COME UP WITH.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.025
LOOK, I LOVE MY WIFE.

22:34.025 --> 22:37.528
IS IT A PERFECT MARRIAGE?
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:37.528 --> 22:41.198
IF YOU FIND ONE,
LET ME KNOW.

22:41.198 --> 22:42.934
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

22:42.934 --> 22:45.269
WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SON
TOGETHER.

22:45.269 --> 22:47.271
AND, YES, WE'RE GOING
THROUGH SOME THINGS,

22:47.271 --> 22:48.439
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

22:48.439 --> 22:51.943
WITH WHAT I WANT TO DO
HERE, NOW.

22:51.943 --> 22:53.878
WHERE IS YOUR WIFE TODAY,
MR. STAFFORD?

22:53.878 --> 22:58.049
MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER WANTED THEM
UP HERE WITH ME TODAY,

22:58.049 --> 22:59.617
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

22:59.617 --> 23:02.553
THEY'RE MY FAMILY.
THEY'RE NOT ACCESSORIES.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.690
THEY'RE NOT TOOLS TO BE USED
TO ADVANCE MY CAREER.

23:05.690 --> 23:08.859
THEY'RE ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD TO ME.

23:10.761 --> 23:12.763
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.

23:19.101 --> 23:21.899
<i>AND I WILL FIGHT</i>
<i>FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS STATE,</i>

23:21.899 --> 23:24.068
<i>FOR OUR CHILDREN,</i>

23:24.068 --> 23:27.044
<i>FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.</i>
DUDE WAS KIND OF A TOOL,

23:27.044 --> 23:29.179
BUT YOU GOT TO VOTE
FOR SOMEBODY, I GUESS.

23:29.179 --> 23:31.181
YEAH.
I'M NOT A FAN.

23:31.181 --> 23:35.185
SO, HOW YOU BEEN?

23:35.185 --> 23:37.187
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU
AROUND HERE ANYMORE

23:37.187 --> 23:38.555
AFTER ALL
THAT'S HAPPENED.

23:38.555 --> 23:40.557
I WAS WONDERING,

23:40.557 --> 23:43.493
DO YOU HAVE ANY CARS THAT
WOULD HOLD UP ON A LONG TRIP --

23:43.493 --> 23:46.163
SOMETHING RELIABLE,
NOT TOO MUCH MILEAGE?

23:46.163 --> 23:48.065
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

23:48.065 --> 23:50.333
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.869
I GOT THIS ONE HERE.

23:52.869 --> 23:55.205
BEEN FIXING IT UP
TO RESELL.

23:55.205 --> 23:56.506
NEW TIMING BELT.

23:56.506 --> 23:58.041
RUNS A LITTLE THIRSTY,

23:58.041 --> 24:00.343
BUT GOT ONLY 110,000 MILES
ON IT.

24:00.343 --> 24:03.280
SURE.
THIS WILL DO FINE.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.550
DON'T EVEN CARE
HOW MUCH I'M ASKING, HUH?

24:06.550 --> 24:10.387
NICE BEING RICH.

24:10.387 --> 24:12.389
I'M NOT PAYING.

24:12.389 --> 24:17.060
YOU WANT TO TRADE ME A CAR
WORTH $60K

24:17.060 --> 24:19.029
FOR A BEAT-UP PICKUP
WITH A BAD PAINT JOB.

24:20.097 --> 24:23.100
DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.
DON'T WANT IT.

24:23.100 --> 24:25.102
WELL, HELL, GO BUY YOURSELF
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

24:25.102 --> 24:26.436
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY.

24:26.436 --> 24:28.939
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
BARTERING WITH ME.

24:28.939 --> 24:30.774
YEAH, BUT YOU ALWAYS LIKED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

24:30.774 --> 24:32.442
SURE, BUT --

24:32.442 --> 24:35.112
WELL, WOULD IT MAKE YOU HAPPY
DRIVING THIS THING AROUND?

24:35.112 --> 24:36.947
LOTS OF THINGS
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

24:36.947 --> 24:39.950
EVERYBODY DESERVES
A LITTLE HAPPY.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.818
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

25:11.314 --> 25:13.984
HEY, TEEJ,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:13.984 --> 25:15.452
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:15.452 --> 25:16.820
YEAH, GREAT.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.756
WELL, WHY DID I COME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO MEET YOU?

25:22.592 --> 25:25.929
DID YOU KNOW THAT DAD
WAS IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN

25:25.929 --> 25:28.265
BEFORE HE MET MOM?

25:28.265 --> 25:31.601
UM...NO, I DIDN'T.

25:31.601 --> 25:33.470
SHE WAS
A BLUES SINGER.

25:33.470 --> 25:36.806
SHE WORKED A-A-AT THAT PLACE,
THE GREEN MILL,

25:36.806 --> 25:38.308
WHERE HE USED TO WORK.

25:38.308 --> 25:40.810
UH, IT'S UP
ON THE NORTH SIDE.

25:40.810 --> 25:43.046
IT'S ALL --
IT'S ALL IN HERE.

25:46.216 --> 25:48.151
I'M GONNA GET
A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.

25:48.151 --> 25:49.219
DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING?

25:49.219 --> 25:52.389
NO, THANKS.

26:02.365 --> 26:07.204
UM...I'M LOOKING
FOR KAYLA.

26:07.204 --> 26:08.538
OVER THERE.

26:13.843 --> 26:16.746
KAYLA?

26:16.746 --> 26:18.381
KAYLA DuMOND?

26:18.381 --> 26:20.217
DO I KNOW YOU?

26:20.217 --> 26:21.885
MY NAME'S T.J. CARSON.

26:21.885 --> 26:24.788
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

26:31.127 --> 26:35.131
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU EXISTED
TILL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

26:35.131 --> 26:36.633
WHAT MADE HIM TELL YOU?

26:36.633 --> 26:39.636
HE WROTE IT
IN A LETTER.

26:39.636 --> 26:41.271
HE DIED.

26:41.271 --> 26:43.406
OH, I'M SORRY.

26:43.406 --> 26:48.011
HE THOUGHT YOU WERE IN DETROIT,
BUT I FOUND YOU HERE.

26:48.011 --> 26:51.848
MY SON AND I LEFT MICHIGAN
AFTER MY MOTHER DIED.

26:51.848 --> 26:53.783
WE NEEDED A NEW START.

26:56.586 --> 26:58.088
ARE YOU KAYLA?

26:58.088 --> 27:00.624
THIS IS ELAINE.

27:02.626 --> 27:05.695
MY BOY OFTEN ASKS ABOUT
THIS SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

27:05.695 --> 27:09.266
NOW I GOT A GOOD STORY
FOR HIM.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.736
UM, HOW --
HOW OLD IS HE?

27:12.736 --> 27:13.970
15.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.071
OH, HERE.

27:15.071 --> 27:17.874
YOU NEED TO SIGN THESE,
LAINIE.

27:17.874 --> 27:19.643
WHAT?
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

27:19.643 --> 27:21.711
I WANT TO TRANSFER
HALF OF MY TRUST

27:21.711 --> 27:23.647
TO KAYLA AND HER SON.

27:23.647 --> 27:25.248
T.J...

27:25.248 --> 27:26.316
YOU'RE THE TRUSTEE.

27:26.316 --> 27:28.084
I NEED YOU TO SIGN IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

27:28.084 --> 27:29.586
WAIT, NO.
REALLY, I COULDN'T. I --

27:29.586 --> 27:32.022
NO, IT'S --
IT'S OKAY, KAYLA.

27:32.022 --> 27:33.256
REALLY, IT IS.

27:33.256 --> 27:34.724
WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY.

27:34.724 --> 27:37.160
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S TRUE
ABOUT US, IT'S THAT.

27:38.261 --> 27:40.330
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE FAMILY.

27:47.937 --> 27:50.373
SO, YOU LURED ME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

27:50.373 --> 27:52.909
SO YOU COULD GIVE AWAY
HALF YOUR MONEY.

27:52.909 --> 27:56.746
AND TO MEET OUR SISTER.

27:56.746 --> 28:01.951
OH, AND ONE MORE THING --
THE BEST JERKY IN WISCONSIN.

28:03.253 --> 28:05.355
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CAR?

28:05.355 --> 28:07.157
I WANTED SOMETHING
MORE PRACTICAL.

28:07.157 --> 28:08.491
YEAH.

28:08.491 --> 28:10.093
WHY DON'T YOU FOLLOW ME
INTO TOWN?

28:10.093 --> 28:11.428
I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH VAL.

28:11.428 --> 28:15.765
ACTUALLY, LAINIE,
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO THE CITY.

28:15.765 --> 28:17.934
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

28:17.934 --> 28:20.737
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO
TO SAN FRANCISCO,

28:20.737 --> 28:22.839
SEE THAT
BIG ORANGE BRIDGE.

28:22.839 --> 28:24.474
WAIT.
CALIFORNIA?

28:24.474 --> 28:28.311
BY YOURSELF?
FOR HOW LONG?

28:28.311 --> 28:30.347
WELL, FOR A WHILE.

28:30.347 --> 28:31.681
SEE HOW IT GOES.

28:31.681 --> 28:33.683
I HAD A FRIEND WHO MOVED
OUT THERE LAST YEAR,

28:33.683 --> 28:36.353
AND HE SAID HE COULD SET ME UP
WITH A JOB FIXING CARS

28:36.353 --> 28:38.121
AT -- AT AN AUTO DEALER.

28:38.121 --> 28:39.989
NO, THAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

28:39.989 --> 28:43.159
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY GOOD TO ME.

28:43.159 --> 28:45.995
YOU'VE BEEN THE BEST SISTER
I-I COULD EVER WISH FOR.

28:45.995 --> 28:49.165
SO, PLEASE,
DON'T FIGHT ME ON THIS.

28:49.165 --> 28:51.000
BUT IT'S SO FAR AWAY.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.236
YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN LIVED
BY YOURSELF.

28:54.504 --> 28:59.843
IT'S TIME I STARTED TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF MY LIFE.

28:59.843 --> 29:03.513
I GOT TO STOP LETTING
ONE BAD THING

29:03.513 --> 29:05.348
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO

29:05.348 --> 29:07.517
BE MY WHOLE STORY.

29:07.517 --> 29:09.519
THAT'S NOT MY STORY.

29:09.519 --> 29:12.021
MY STORY
IS JUST BEGINNING.

29:12.021 --> 29:14.257
STARTING TODAY.

29:17.660 --> 29:20.163
WELL, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO
SO SOON?

29:20.163 --> 29:22.265
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST WAIT
A LITTLE WHILE?

29:22.265 --> 29:25.101
I WANT TO BE
ON MY OWN<i> NOW.</i>

29:25.101 --> 29:27.670
I WANT TO BE
OUT IN THE WORLD.

29:32.942 --> 29:35.445
WELL, THE WORLD'S GONNA BE
A BETTER PLACE.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.187
I GOT A POSTCARD
FROM T.J.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.778
HE WAS PASSING
THROUGH SOUTH DAKOTA.

30:14.778 --> 30:17.447
YEAH. I, UH --
I TALKED TO HIM THIS MORNING.

30:17.447 --> 30:18.849
HE'S IN IDAHO ALREADY.

30:18.849 --> 30:21.852
HE, UM, TOOK A BREAK
FROM THE DRIVE

30:21.852 --> 30:23.787
TO DO SOME ICE FISHING.

30:23.787 --> 30:28.091
SELLING THIS PLACE
DIDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

30:28.091 --> 30:32.262
SELLERS' MARKET,
I GUESS.

30:32.262 --> 30:35.098
JUST FEELS SO FAST.

30:35.098 --> 30:36.600
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

30:36.600 --> 30:38.702
VAL'S GONNA BE IN COLLEGE
IN THE FALL,

30:38.702 --> 30:41.538
AND I CAN'T WALK BY
VIC'S ROOM WITHOUT...

30:43.440 --> 30:46.777
I KNOW.

30:46.777 --> 30:48.846
ME NEITHER.

30:48.846 --> 30:52.983
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE MISSED IT, JACK.

30:52.983 --> 30:55.319
ALL THOSE YEARS
HE MUST HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING.

30:55.319 --> 30:57.054
HOW DID WE NOT SEE IT?

30:57.054 --> 31:01.725
WHAT KIND OF PARENTS
WERE WE?

31:02.893 --> 31:05.395
YOU'RE A GREAT MOTHER,

31:05.395 --> 31:07.564
AND YOU ALWAYS
HAVE BEEN.

31:07.564 --> 31:12.069
I DIDN'T HOLD UP
MY END OF THE BARGAIN,

31:12.069 --> 31:14.171
BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR THAT.

31:14.171 --> 31:17.007
YOU, UH,
START THAT NEW JOB YET?

31:17.007 --> 31:19.142
UH, NO.
NO, NEXT WEEK.

31:21.979 --> 31:23.847
WELL,
I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

31:23.847 --> 31:26.984
YEAH. ME, TOO.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.490
I'LL --
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

31:44.368 --> 31:47.204
I WASH CARS
ON THE STREET, ODD JOBS.

31:47.204 --> 31:50.040
I HAVE SAVED THE MONEY.
I CAN BUY HER A PLANE TICKET.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.709
BUT STILL,
THEY TELL ME NO.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.711
MR. ABDAZE, THIS IS
OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION.

31:54.711 --> 31:57.247
PLEASE.
AN ORPHAN GIRL IN THE CAMPS.

31:57.247 --> 32:01.218
SHE'LL BE RAPED, KILLED.

32:04.087 --> 32:05.589
OKAY, HOLD ON.

32:05.589 --> 32:08.592
HEY, GRANT.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

32:08.592 --> 32:10.093
AH, TWO MINUTES. GO.

32:10.093 --> 32:11.595
YOU SEE THAT GUY?

32:11.595 --> 32:14.031
A SOMALIAN REFUGEE
WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD NIECE

32:14.031 --> 32:15.599
RECENTLY ORPHANED
IN A CAMP OUTSIDE MOGADISHU.

32:15.599 --> 32:18.435
NOW, HE WANTS TO
FLY HER OVER,

32:18.435 --> 32:19.770
BUT SINCE SHE'S NOT
IMMEDIATE FAMILY,

32:19.770 --> 32:21.204
SHE'S BEEN DECLINED
REFUGEE STATUS.

32:21.204 --> 32:22.706
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
WOULD SHOW UP AT OUR BORDERS

32:22.706 --> 32:24.541
IF WE STARTED LETTING IN
EXTENDED FAMILY?

32:24.541 --> 32:26.710
EVERYONE IS A COUSIN
IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.512
SHE'S 6 YEARS OLD.

32:28.512 --> 32:30.647
LOOK, I KNOW SOMEONE AT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT I COULD CALL --
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:30.647 --> 32:32.049
I KNOW. I KNOW.
YOU'RE A FIXER.

32:32.049 --> 32:34.251
AND I KNOW YOU'RE USED TO
GETTING THINGS YOUR OWN WAY.

32:34.251 --> 32:36.653
BUT THESE KINDS
OF PROBLEMS --

32:36.653 --> 32:38.889
THEY'RE TOO BIG, ALL RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T FIX THEM.

32:43.894 --> 32:48.065
SO, I HAVE TO DO
A VOLUNTEER PROJECT FOR SCHOOL,

32:48.065 --> 32:50.067
AND I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE I CAN DO

32:50.067 --> 32:51.568
AN INTERNSHIP
FOR YOU HERE.

32:51.568 --> 32:53.904
WELL, THIS PLACE
IS PRETTY CHAOTIC.

32:53.904 --> 32:55.572
I MEAN,
IT'S COOL, THOUGH.

32:55.572 --> 32:58.742
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE DOING IT.

32:58.742 --> 33:00.577
HOW WAS
THE COLLEGE TOUR?

33:00.577 --> 33:04.247
IT WAS GOOD.
MOM DROVE ME A LITTLE CRAZY.

33:04.247 --> 33:07.918
YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER --
YOU'RE TOUGH, BRAVE.

33:07.918 --> 33:10.253
SHE SAID
YOU LIKE N.Y.U.

33:10.253 --> 33:13.423
YEAH. UM,
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ANYMORE.

33:13.423 --> 33:15.759
I'M THINKING
MAYBE OF TAKING A YEAR OFF

33:15.759 --> 33:17.928
TO TRAVEL
THROUGHOUT EUROPE.

33:17.928 --> 33:21.765
JULES HAS ALWAYS
WANTED TO SEE ITALY, SO...

33:21.765 --> 33:23.767
WHAT? BAD IDEA?

33:23.767 --> 33:25.102
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT,
YEAH.

33:25.102 --> 33:26.770
YOU KNOW,
TELL YOU NOT TO DO IT,

33:26.770 --> 33:29.106
"GO TO COLLEGE,"
ALL THE NORMAL PARENT STUFF.

33:29.106 --> 33:31.008
AND THEN I REALIZED
WHAT A HYPOCRITE I'D BE.

33:31.008 --> 33:34.311
DO YOU LOVE JULES?

33:34.311 --> 33:36.646
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

33:36.646 --> 33:42.052
YOU KNOW, I SPENT TOO MANY YEARS
JUST GOING WITH THE FLOW,

33:42.052 --> 33:46.390
YOU KNOW, NOT BEING DELIBERATE
WITH MY LIFE, MY CHOICES.

33:46.390 --> 33:49.559
YOU DON'T GET HAPPY
JUST BY ACCIDENT?

33:49.559 --> 33:51.561
YOU GOT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

33:51.561 --> 33:53.830
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED, IT'S THAT.

33:55.532 --> 33:57.901
COME ON.
FARE'S ON ME.

33:57.901 --> 33:59.503
I CAN'T.
I'M MEETING UP WITH JULES.

33:59.503 --> 34:01.238
BUT WILL YOU SEE
ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP?

34:01.238 --> 34:02.706
SURE.

34:02.706 --> 34:06.410
BYE.

34:06.410 --> 34:08.345
THANK YOU.

35:01.546 --> 35:07.278
NONE OF US WOULD HAVE --
I -- AND I NEVER --

35:07.278 --> 35:08.780
OH, GOD.

35:08.780 --> 35:10.949
ANYTHING I TRY TO SAY
ABOUT VIC

35:10.949 --> 35:13.251
JUST COMES OUT SOUNDING
SO...INADEQUATE.

35:13.251 --> 35:16.621
YOU NEVER CAME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

35:16.621 --> 35:20.959
WELL,
I HEARD YOU WERE STABLE,

35:20.959 --> 35:22.627
AND THEN ELAINE TOLD ME
YOU WERE DISCHARGED,

35:22.627 --> 35:25.864
SO I-I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OKAY.

35:28.032 --> 35:30.869
YOU KNOW, IT'S LATE.
I SHOULD GET GOING.

35:30.869 --> 35:33.872
YEAH. ME, TOO.

35:37.442 --> 35:39.677
WHERE
ARE YOU LIVING NOW?

35:39.677 --> 35:41.913
OH, HIGH-RISE
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS THAT WAY.

35:44.282 --> 35:46.451
SOUNDS NICE.

35:46.451 --> 35:48.786
YOU KNOW, IT'S EASY.

35:48.786 --> 35:52.957
IT'S GOT A NICE VIEW
OF THE WATER.

35:58.897 --> 36:02.634
WELL,
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.

36:04.802 --> 36:08.206
TAKE CARE.

36:18.249 --> 36:19.484
EXCUSE ME, ALDERMAN,

36:19.484 --> 36:21.152
CAN I PLEASE GET A COMMENT
FOR THE<i> HERALD?</i>

36:21.152 --> 36:23.087
ALDERMAN.
<i>SHE'S</i> THE ONE

36:23.087 --> 36:25.189
WHO TOOK MILLIONS IN BRIBES
FROM THE UNIONS?

36:25.189 --> 36:26.958
SHE LOOKS LIKE
MY JUNIOR-HIGH PRINCIPAL.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.026
ALDERMAN!

36:28.026 --> 36:29.827
THINK WE CAN GET THE<i> TIMES</i>
TO RUN IT?

36:29.827 --> 36:31.496
WELL, THEY OWE US.

36:31.496 --> 36:34.666
THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD SCOOP
WE'VE GIVEN THEM IN TWO WEEKS.

36:34.666 --> 36:37.168
LOOK AT YOU,
ALL "THEY OWE US."

36:37.168 --> 36:39.604
YOU'RE COCKY.
I LIKE IT.

36:39.604 --> 36:43.408
I RAN INTO JACK.

36:43.408 --> 36:44.909
WHOA.

36:44.909 --> 36:47.412
IT WAS AWFUL,
LIKE WE WERE STRANGERS.

36:47.412 --> 36:48.913
WELL,
MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST.

36:48.913 --> 36:52.750
I MEAN, IF DREW WINS,
YOU'RE MOVING TO D.C., RIGHT?

36:52.750 --> 36:55.920
I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVEN'T
REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.923
DUDE, THAT'S LIKE
A MAJOR ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM...

36:58.923 --> 37:01.759
OR AT LEAST
A VERY LARGE DOG,

37:01.759 --> 37:03.561
LIKE A MASTIFF.

37:03.561 --> 37:07.565
ARE YOU AND DREW
BACK TOGETHER OR NOT?

37:07.565 --> 37:09.400
I'M NOT SURE.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.870
NEITHER OF US IS.

37:15.273 --> 37:17.609
WENT UP ANOTHER FIVE POINTS
IN THE POLLS.

37:17.609 --> 37:19.544
IF THIS KEEPS UP,
I'LL PASS DANIELS

37:19.544 --> 37:21.713
BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

37:21.713 --> 37:22.914
UM...

37:22.914 --> 37:24.315
THEN WHAT?

37:24.315 --> 37:28.386
WE -- WE ALL MOVE
TO D.C. TOGETHER?

37:34.225 --> 37:36.060
DREW...

37:38.396 --> 37:40.565
DO WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

37:40.565 --> 37:42.800
ARE WE JUST
PLAYING HOUSE?

37:42.800 --> 37:46.070
I MEAN, THIS --
THIS TIME TOGETHER, IT'S --

37:46.070 --> 37:50.575
IT'S FELT GOOD.
IT'S...FELT RIGHT.

37:50.575 --> 37:53.077
BUT I'M --
I'M WORRIED.

37:53.077 --> 37:56.748
WORRIED THAT
WE'RE CHASING SOMETHING,

37:56.748 --> 37:59.283
SOMETHING THAT WE LOST.

37:59.283 --> 38:01.519
MAYBE WE NEVER
REALLY HAD IT.

38:03.021 --> 38:06.190
WE WERE
TOO YOUNG AND DUMB

38:06.190 --> 38:07.859
TO REALIZE
WE WEREN'T DOING IT RIGHT.

38:07.859 --> 38:10.695
BUT THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,

38:10.695 --> 38:13.364
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
WE FOUND SOMETHING --

38:13.364 --> 38:14.432
A CONNECTION,

38:14.432 --> 38:16.034
A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
OF EACH OTHER.

38:16.034 --> 38:19.003
AND I KNOW
THAT IT'S CRAZY,

38:19.003 --> 38:23.608
BACKWARDS,
AND ALL THIS CRAP...

38:23.608 --> 38:25.376
THIS WHOLE NIGHTMARE.

38:28.279 --> 38:32.617
MAYBE WE HAD TO GO THROUGH
ALL OF IT TO GET THIS CLOSE...

38:32.617 --> 38:35.453
TO END UP HERE.

38:38.389 --> 38:43.895
YOU EVER SEE D.C. WHEN THE
CHERRY BLOSSOMS ARE IN BLOOM?

38:43.895 --> 38:45.563
IT'S PRETTY EXCELLENT.

38:54.872 --> 38:58.109
WHEN YOU TOLD ME LAST MONTH
YOU WERE GOING TO GET HER,

38:58.109 --> 39:00.511
I HAD NO IDEA
IT WOULD HAPPEN SO FAST.

39:00.511 --> 39:02.180
WELL, WE GOT LUCKY
WITH THE RELIEF FLIGHT.

39:02.180 --> 39:04.482
IT'S MORE THAN LUCK,
MR. McALLISTER. YOU KNOW THAT.

39:04.482 --> 39:06.851
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
FASCIKA.

39:06.851 --> 39:10.521
SHE WANTS YOU
TO HAVE IT.

39:12.156 --> 39:14.492
THANK YOU.

39:14.492 --> 39:15.793
AW, I LOVE IT.

39:19.363 --> 39:22.600
GOOD LUCK, MR. ABDAZE.
STAY IN TOUCH.

39:27.271 --> 39:29.874
NEW JOB?

39:29.874 --> 39:31.242
YEAH.

39:31.242 --> 39:35.747
A PLACE LIKE THIS COULD HAVE
REALLY HELPED YOUR PARENTS.

39:35.747 --> 39:38.916
EXACTLY.

39:38.916 --> 39:41.419
I GOT TO CATCH A TRAIN.

39:41.419 --> 39:43.421
WELL, I'LL WALK YOU.

39:45.890 --> 39:50.394
I COULDN'T LEAVE THINGS
THE WAY WE DID THE OTHER DAY.

39:50.394 --> 39:51.896
THE CONVERSATION,
IT WAS JUST --

39:51.896 --> 39:53.564
TERRIBLE.
YEAH.

39:55.767 --> 39:59.103
LOOK...
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

39:59.103 --> 40:01.139
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, SARA?

40:01.139 --> 40:04.142
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU NEVER CAME TO SEE ME

40:04.142 --> 40:05.710
AT THE HOSPITAL.

40:09.981 --> 40:11.482
MAYBE I DID.

40:11.482 --> 40:15.119
MAYBE I RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL
FROM THE POLICE STATION

40:15.119 --> 40:17.622
AFTER VIC WAS BOOKED.

40:17.622 --> 40:21.759
MAYBE I GOT WITHIN 10 FEET
OF THE ROOM AND TURNED AROUND.

40:21.759 --> 40:26.097
WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

40:26.097 --> 40:29.767
FOR ONCE I DECIDED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

40:29.767 --> 40:34.405
BUT IS NEVER SEEING EACH OTHER
AGAIN THE RIGHT THING?

40:34.405 --> 40:36.741
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW.

40:36.741 --> 40:39.443
SEEING YOU THAT DAY
ON THE EL PLATFORM,

40:39.443 --> 40:42.246
I CAN'T STOP ASKING MYSELF
THAT QUESTION.

40:43.781 --> 40:45.449
YEAH.

40:45.449 --> 40:47.451
ME, NEITHER.

40:50.321 --> 40:54.692
I GOT TO GO.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

42:11.936 --> 42:14.739
HI.

42:14.739 --> 42:17.909
I ORDERED YOU
A GLASS OF WINE.
