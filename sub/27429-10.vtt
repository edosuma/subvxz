30:07.500 --> 30:08.799
Good talking to you.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.840
Yeah, you too, man.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.074

30:21.730 --> 30:23.060
How could you do that?

30:23.100 --> 30:24.470
I needed a re-birthday break.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.330
How could you not tell
me Jeff was in town?

30:28.070 --> 30:29.440
What did you say?

30:29.470 --> 30:32.100
No, what did you say
to make him go away?

30:32.180 --> 30:33.300
Not much.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.640
How could you let me suffer all day?

30:35.680 --> 30:38.080
And make me think he
didn't care about me?

30:38.110 --> 30:39.660
How could you do that?

30:39.670 --> 30:41.410
- How could you ruin my birthday?
- Okay, okay.

30:41.450 --> 30:43.020
- (CHEERING)
- MARIANA: Party's over!

30:43.050 --> 30:44.790
(ALL LAUGHING)

30:46.740 --> 30:48.390
Oh, shit, they actually did it.

30:48.420 --> 30:49.640
BRANDON: Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

30:49.670 --> 30:51.220
- I... I...
- Seat belts, everyone!

30:51.260 --> 30:52.890
I can only have four passengers.

30:52.930 --> 30:54.860
Stop being such a rule follower, go!

30:55.900 --> 30:57.360
(SCREAMING)

31:05.360 --> 31:07.110
You wanna know what I
told him after I hit him?

31:07.140 --> 31:08.200
You hit him?

31:08.210 --> 31:09.910
I told him that you're
trying to move on.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.710
I told him you're trying to learn
to love yourself, respect yourself.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.980
Believe that you're worthy of
love, fully and exclusively.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.280
Davia, because you are.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.340
God!

31:18.350 --> 31:19.540
I told him if he can't be that person

31:19.550 --> 31:21.580
if he can't give you
everything that you need,

31:21.600 --> 31:23.080
then he should leave.

31:24.940 --> 31:26.640
Which he did.

31:27.660 --> 31:28.790
(CHUCKLES)

31:28.830 --> 31:32.060
And what do you know about
love and self-respect?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.270
You hate yourself, Dennis.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.500
How about I start treating
myself with respect when you do?

31:48.400 --> 31:51.020
So, I want you to have this.

31:51.050 --> 31:52.450
Why?

31:52.490 --> 31:54.240
For being my plus one tonight.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.899
Well, it was mandatory, right?

31:55.900 --> 31:59.040
And if they file a police report,
you have the stolen property.

31:59.060 --> 32:00.790
- Oh.
- (GIGGLING)

32:00.830 --> 32:04.160
Also for sticking up for
me with Alex and Sam.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.700
And losing them as friends.

32:05.730 --> 32:08.200
I'd rather be your friend.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.270
I had fun tonight.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.700
Me too.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.370
More fun than I'm sure they had.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.860
Should we give them
something to talk about?

32:22.940 --> 32:24.520
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

32:25.040 --> 32:27.550
(CAMERA CLICKS)

32:27.590 --> 32:29.060
(BOTH LAUGH)

32:29.720 --> 32:32.890
Personally, I like Maraj
for our shipper name.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.830
Maraj it is.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.600
Mmm.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.070
Who invented ice cream?

32:43.100 --> 32:44.700
King Tang of Shang.

32:45.300 --> 32:46.380
It's true.

32:46.410 --> 32:48.200
The first ice cream was eaten in China.

32:48.210 --> 32:51.370
Well, of course. All good
things are made in China.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.150
Tonight reminded me of how
much fun we used to have.

33:01.190 --> 33:02.250
Yeah.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.230
Um... Well, good night.

33:16.780 --> 33:19.500
Why don't you just tell
Eliza you want to work?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.000
Driving for Coche?

33:21.010 --> 33:23.019
Callie, she's gonna
think I don't trust her

33:23.020 --> 33:24.879
or that I'm not fully committed

33:24.880 --> 33:27.610
if I don't feel like
what's hers is ours.

33:27.650 --> 33:29.350
Well, she has a point.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.820
Brandon, I know that...

33:32.850 --> 33:36.220
you have a hard time not
being the caretaker,

33:36.250 --> 33:38.720
but I'm sure you take care of her

33:38.760 --> 33:41.990
in ways far more important
than making money.

33:42.630 --> 33:43.790
Yeah.

33:43.830 --> 33:46.900
Jamie tells me she's on
the road quite a bit?

33:46.930 --> 33:51.770
Yeah, I mainly drive when
she's working or gone.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.500
So you're alone a lot?

33:53.510 --> 33:57.040
Yeah, I like to drive. You know,
it's nice to have people to talk to.

33:57.070 --> 33:59.180
So tell her that.

33:59.210 --> 34:02.340
Tell her you want to drive
because you get lonely.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.080
And you have me and Mariana.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.750
Yeah, but you guys are
busy with your careers.

34:09.790 --> 34:11.040
And I don't want to bug you.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.590
Brandon, we are family.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.620
It's no bug at all.

34:15.659 --> 34:17.429
And you're welcome to hang out here.

34:17.460 --> 34:21.159
There is always someone to
talk to and plenty of drama.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.730
As you saw tonight.

34:22.739 --> 34:25.020
Any of that drama involve
that Latin demigod,

34:25.050 --> 34:27.139
in the backseat?

34:27.170 --> 34:29.199
- What was his name?
- Gael.

34:31.770 --> 34:32.940
Maybe a little.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.040
Must be tough, living in
the same place together.

34:37.380 --> 34:41.580
I mean, it's not like we can just
avoid running into each other.

34:42.750 --> 34:46.090
But... this talk is about you and Eliza.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.280
- Talk to her.
- I will.

34:49.659 --> 34:52.060
Speaking of, I better get going.

34:53.580 --> 34:55.800
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.030
(DOOR OPENS)

35:02.340 --> 35:03.500
Oh, hey.

35:03.540 --> 35:05.000
Hey.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.820
I know my way out. I'm gonna
say good night to Mariana.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.920
- See ya.
- See ya.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.360
I'm sorry.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.520
I never meant to make you feel used.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.190
You weren't just a distraction.

35:26.230 --> 35:28.760
And it wasn't just about the sex.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.070
Which probably scared me.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.970
And I'm sorry I made it all about me.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.870
Which is something I
guess I have to work on.

35:39.910 --> 35:42.340
Yeah, well, we can't all be perfect.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.350
We never really got to know each other.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.040
Sex can be the easy part.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.320
Maybe we could get to know
each other as friends.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.980
Yeah, I'd like that.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.030
Night.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.060
Good job on those wings.

36:23.680 --> 36:27.050
I overheard you and Callie
arguing the other night.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.090
I know she broke up with you.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.930
So what I need to know
is, if she hadn't...

36:39.680 --> 36:41.370
would you have chosen me?

36:47.620 --> 36:49.939
All right, even though I won,

36:49.940 --> 36:52.520
you get to ask me three
personal questions.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.770
- Hm?
- Mm-hm.

36:56.810 --> 36:57.870
Okay.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.810
You close with your brother?

37:01.580 --> 37:03.480
Mmm, no.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.410
I wanna be, but he doesn't.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.850
What about your mother?

37:09.020 --> 37:11.090
She is an alcoholic.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.220
And... a drug addict.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.660
Former drug addict.

37:15.780 --> 37:16.990
I don't know.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.660
Father?

37:22.530 --> 37:23.700
I don't know where he is.

37:23.730 --> 37:26.230
- But you...
- And that's... That's three.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.930
One more?

37:27.970 --> 37:29.640
Last one for the night.

37:29.670 --> 37:30.840
Okay.

37:32.070 --> 37:33.260
Can I kiss you?

37:33.480 --> 37:34.910
Mmm...

37:35.580 --> 37:36.880
Okay.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.650
Look, I don't wanna play
the "what-if" game.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.020
I did choose you, Brian.

37:50.290 --> 37:51.900
And I don't regret it.

37:52.230 --> 37:53.560
Look, if you...

37:54.000 --> 37:55.960
can't trust that, then...

37:57.670 --> 37:59.100
this won't work.

38:06.640 --> 38:07.710
Okay.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.520
Hey! Joey, it's Alice.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.060
Leaving a message.

38:24.090 --> 38:25.460
Obviously, so...

38:25.490 --> 38:27.250
VOICE MAIL: <i>If you have finished
your recording, please... </i>

38:27.260 --> 38:29.230
Sorry, your voice mail cut me off.

38:29.260 --> 38:31.260
The reason why I couldn't do
your friends comedy show...

38:31.300 --> 38:33.330
VOICE MAIL: <i>If you have finished
your recording, please hang up or... </i>

38:33.370 --> 38:36.169
Me again. I'm not sure how
much of that you got,

38:36.170 --> 38:39.370
but it's not because I'm
not over Sumi, okay?

38:39.410 --> 38:42.460
I'm 100% totally over her.

38:42.470 --> 38:46.210
But I'm not over wanting
that second date with you.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.799
VOICE MAIL: <i>If you have
finished your recording... </i>

38:47.800 --> 38:50.350
- <i>Please hang up or press one.</i>
- Dammit.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.120
Maybe I should just text this,

38:52.150 --> 38:54.019
but the reason why I couldn't
do your friend's show

38:54.020 --> 38:55.220
is because I'm not out to my parents

38:55.240 --> 38:56.890
and I hope that's not a deal breaker.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.200
VOICE MAIL: <i>If you have
finished your recording,</i>

38:58.210 --> 39:00.630
<i>please hang up or press

40:25.040 --> 40:26.540
Your birthday is over.

40:27.540 --> 40:29.140
How's 25 so far?

40:32.060 --> 40:34.020
Seems like 24.

40:35.450 --> 40:36.990
I can't do this anymore.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.620
I can't be in a relationship that's
going nowhere year after year.

40:43.430 --> 40:44.860
(STAMMERING): You need to go.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.220
