WEBVTT

00:06.571 --> 00:08.573
- Sergeant Platt?

00:08.617 --> 00:14.057
Blair Williams. I'm working
with Superintendent Kelton.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.146
I'm a political consultant.

00:19.062 --> 00:22.065
The superintendent has
a press conference next Tuesday

00:22.109 --> 00:23.414
in Millennium Park.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.025
He's announcing a new,
female-forward

00:25.068 --> 00:26.591
recruiting initiative,

00:26.635 --> 00:28.071
and he's hoping you'd be
willing to lend your support.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.638
- How?
- By standing with him

00:29.681 --> 00:31.205
at the press conference.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.555
- You want me to stand next to
Lake Michigan in February?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.339
It's a great cause.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.341
- Where are you from, Blair?

00:37.385 --> 00:38.212
- D.C.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.214
- Ah, well, maybe in D.C.,

00:40.257 --> 00:43.391
you can get away with a pretty
smile and a $1,000 suit

00:43.434 --> 00:46.263
and ask for a favor, but that's
not how it works in Chicago.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.918
- I'm not asking for me;
I'm asking for my boss,

00:48.961 --> 00:51.051
who's also your boss.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.096
- Ooh.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.403
Then he can ask me himself.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.889
- Hey.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.543
- I kn--I know you?

01:05.587 --> 01:07.371
- Blair. Yeah, we met
at the Kelton fund raiser.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.677
- Oh, yeah.
Right, right, right. I'm--

01:08.720 --> 01:09.939
- You're Kim.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.462
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I remember.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.898
- Oh, nice.
What are you doing here?

01:12.942 --> 01:14.335
- Getting pummeled by
your desk sergeant.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.163
- Oh, that's super normal.
Don't worry.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.208
- Mm. So this is
your district?

01:18.252 --> 01:19.905
- Yeah, this is my
home away from home.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.429
- Ah.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.040
That's funny, I was actually
gonna reach out to you.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.476
- Oh, okay.
What's up?

01:25.520 --> 01:28.653
- I got two tickets
for the Joffrey this Friday.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.135
- Yeah?

01:32.179 --> 01:33.919
- Uh, look, if you're
seeing somebody--

01:33.963 --> 01:36.748
- No, I-I was--I'm like--

01:36.792 --> 01:38.924
No.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.057
- Think about it.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.711
- Kim, Sarge wants us upstairs.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.496
Ruzek heard from the CI.
The deal's on.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.159
- Yeah?

01:56.203 --> 01:57.378
- I just don't think that
the Second Amendment

01:57.421 --> 01:58.988
was created to protect dudes

01:59.031 --> 02:01.295
that are manufacturing
untraceable submachine guns.

02:02.905 --> 02:03.993
- Can you stop moving?

02:04.036 --> 02:05.168
I'm trying
to secure the camera.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.778
- I'm sorry.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.954
Man, my CI
is pissing his pants.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.347
Thanks for the vest.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.870
- Yeah, well,
the other good news is,

02:11.914 --> 02:14.525
the bullets from this gun
rip right through Kevlar.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.615
- Why would you even...

02:17.659 --> 02:19.269
- Was that too dark?
- It was way too dark.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.662
I'm about to go do a gun buy.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.054
- I have a weird sense
of humor.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.665
- I know you do.
You're crazy.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.927
I mean, legitim--

02:28.278 --> 02:29.540
- Talked to Voight.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.629
He wants me and you
to run point.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.153
- Copy that. Good.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.810
We good on the camera?
- Yeah.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.770
All right.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.644
- Money.
- Right, right, right. Right.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.083
They got me riding
in a separate car.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.694
Oh, God.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.919
I can't do this, man.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.704
Davis is gonna kill me
if he finds out I set him up.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.749
- Okay, just
take a deep breath.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.665
All right, we're right here.
Nothing's gonna happen.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.277
She and I, we've done this
100 times before.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.192
All right? We just need
to catch Davis dirty,

03:12.235 --> 03:13.584
get him to tell us
who's making the guns,

03:13.628 --> 03:14.716
and then you are off the hook.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.544
- Yeah, but listen,
listen, hey.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.024
You feel like he's made you,
you just say the safe word.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.244
Christmastime. Okay?

03:21.288 --> 03:24.116
Take a deep breath.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.293
- Yo, Davis.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.382
This is Sherry
and her boy Chris,

03:28.425 --> 03:29.905
the ones I told you about.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.428
They move high-end weed.

03:31.472 --> 03:32.864
- Isn't that supposed
to be legal?

03:32.908 --> 03:34.301
- Yeah, supposed to be.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.693
Problem is, banks won't
handle dope money,

03:35.737 --> 03:38.043
so we end up carrying around
a lot of cash.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.349
- We need a little
extra protection.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.444
- How many guns
you looking for?

03:47.488 --> 03:50.360
How many guns you got?

03:50.404 --> 03:53.320
- My cousin, the businessman.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.235
- Thought she was your cousin.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.846
- Yeah. I mean, the three of us
grew up together.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.369
We're like family.
We've got, like,

03:59.413 --> 04:02.111
20 other cousins.
- Yeah, all good, man.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.895
They're cool, I swear.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.335
- You put your life on that?

04:08.378 --> 04:09.727
- Damn right.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.045
- Step back.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.621
- I think he felt my vest.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.840
Son of a bitch.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.755
Okay.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.453
It's your call.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.587
- Christmastime.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.460
- Kurt, get the hell out
of here right now.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.779
- Chicago PD!
- Step away from the car!

05:06.828 --> 05:08.612
- Damn it!
- Shots fired, shots fired.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.440
He's armed. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.050
- You okay?
- Fine, fine.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.052
- Hey, you come out!

05:14.096 --> 05:16.359
You keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

05:22.191 --> 05:23.410
- Offender down!

05:25.412 --> 05:29.546
- 21. Shots fired by offender
and police, offender down.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.113
Call the crime lab.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.332
- He's dead.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.031
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, listen.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.076
I thought he felt my vest,
so I-I called it.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.382
I'm sorry.

05:39.426 --> 05:42.211
- You got nothing
to be sorry about.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.473
You did the right thing.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.788
All right, our lead suspect

05:53.831 --> 05:56.007
is now laying on a slab
at the morgue,

05:56.051 --> 05:58.009
so we need a plan B.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.968
Well, what else do we know
about these guns?

06:00.011 --> 06:03.188
- Um, this is the machine gun
that Davis was firing at us,

06:03.232 --> 06:04.494
a so-called "cop killer."

06:04.538 --> 06:05.843
He had two other ones
in his trunk.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.628
- We find any prints
on these guns?

06:07.671 --> 06:09.064
- No, I checked with the lab.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.674
The only ones they could find
were from Davis.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.415
- No make, no model,
and no serial numbers,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.851
because some punk
is manufacturing these

06:13.895 --> 06:15.113
off the books.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.680
- So lethal as hell
and totally untraceable.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.813
- All right, what else
do we know about Davis?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.989
- We know he's a local boy
on parole from Statesville.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.991
- And he wasn't supposed
to leave Illinois,

06:23.034 --> 06:25.036
but I ran GPS on his car.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.387
He went to Wisconsin yesterday.
He stayed for 30 minutes,

06:27.430 --> 06:29.040
and then he came back
to Chicago.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.695
- So those GPS coordinates put
him at a depot in the backwoods

06:31.739 --> 06:33.784
which just so happens to be
home to a regional gun show.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.438
- Where he bought the guns.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.918
- Yeah, safe bet
he didn't go for the cheese.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.398
- Okay, well, if that's
where he went,

06:38.441 --> 06:39.573
that's where we gotta go.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.052
Boss, we gotta find
this seller.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.228
- All right, I'll contact
my guy over at the ATF.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.057
He'll swear us all in so we can
work across state lines.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.451
Burgess, you and Halstead
go in as buyers.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.540
Upton and Atwater,
you're backup.

06:50.584 --> 06:51.759
Stay off the radar.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.413
I don't want
the locals involved.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.892
You two hang back with me.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.765
We'll deal with the paperwork
on the Davis shooting.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.292
- Hey.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.424
- Hey.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.817
- Good call yesterday.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.559
No point in taking
that kind of risk.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.822
- Yeah. I just...

07:11.866 --> 07:13.998
feel like I shouldn't have
let him get so close to me.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.478
- No, it was
the right call, Kim.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
All day, every day.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.092
- Thanks.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.402
- About me and Adam...

07:26.446 --> 07:28.926
- Hailey, um, I'm good.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.101
Really.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.060
- I've been wanting
to tell you, I just--

07:32.103 --> 07:34.454
- We haven't been together
for a long time, so...

07:34.497 --> 07:36.499
- Just sorta happened.
- That's great.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.066
I don't really want
to talk about it.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.024
Not now.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.331
Let's just focus on busting the
guy who's making these guns.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.552
Okay.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.522
I'm striking out
all over the place.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.610
- I think I got something.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.959
See these two guys right here?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.657
Black hat and a green jacket?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.528
- Yeah. What about 'em?

08:05.572 --> 08:07.704
- They've been hanging around,
hustling customers all day,

08:07.748 --> 08:08.966
and they don't have a booth.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.533
- No booth,
no background check.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.753
- Yeah, exactly.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.537
- Okay, let's make a play.
- All right.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.973
Listen, I don't know
where they're keeping

08:16.017 --> 08:17.453
their merchandise,
so just don't go too far.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.672
We don't have backup.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.158
- Hey. Hey, man.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.378
If you're looking for power,
what we got is far better.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.075
Fully automatic
and untraceable.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.382
- Hey. You stay the hell away
from my booth,

08:33.425 --> 08:34.557
or I will report you.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.645
- Kiss my ass.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.517
- Hey, come on.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.347
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.827
I heard you guys.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.481
I've been looking
for something untraceable.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.178
- That right?
- Yeah.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.267
My brother and I, we got
a store in Milwaukee, and we...

08:49.311 --> 08:51.531
we sell a lot of guns,
but, you know,

08:51.574 --> 08:53.663
the serious business happens
out back.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.447
- How many pieces you want?

08:55.491 --> 08:57.101
- Depends on what
we're talking.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.715
- These babies right here,

09:01.758 --> 09:02.846
they'll cut through a tank,

09:02.890 --> 09:05.893
and they're 100% untraceable.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.895
- Those are beautiful.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.723
- Yeah.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.551
- All right.
Let me text my brother.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
See what we can do.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.684
- Yeah, but they ain't cheap.
Two grand a pop.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.599
- Please. That's not a problem.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.822
Okay. Says he wants
ten pieces.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.651
- Well, you good for 20 Gs?
Right now?

09:24.694 --> 09:26.217
- Well, I need to see
the merchandise.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.176
- Okay, all right, yeah.
- Okay? Yeah.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.394
- Come on. Come with us.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.572
- We got a problem.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.834
Security's gonna blow up
the deal.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.183
Keep an eye on Kim.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.314
- Copy that.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.753
- Detective Halstead, CPD.
- So?

09:39.796 --> 09:41.189
- Look, um, we're working
a case with ATF,

09:41.232 --> 09:42.582
and the two guys
that you're eyeing,

09:42.625 --> 09:43.887
they're part of the operation.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.497
- Nobody told me about this.
- Roy.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.717
You got somewhere we can talk?
'Cause this is important.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.290
- Mm-hmm.
There they are.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.075
- All right, I'm gonna
follow on foot.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.599
- Be safe.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.605
- Where we going?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.432
- Guns are in our truck.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.653
- Cool.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.222
Nice hand tat.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.093
Is that a spider web?

10:16.137 --> 10:19.096
Yeah, my ex had one
just like it.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.146
Where's this truck?
- Back this way.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.322
We gotta take precautions
with what we're selling.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.758
- Yeah, I get that.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.153
What are you doing?

10:33.589 --> 10:35.547
- What's going on?

10:35.591 --> 10:37.071
- Someone's following us.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.550
- Hey, Jay, where are you, man?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.639
You might want to get out here.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.077
- Man, I told you,
cops are all over these things.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.253
Where?
- Blonde chick.

10:47.342 --> 10:50.040
- Oh, please, relax.
The blonde chick's with me.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.476
Allie!

10:52.826 --> 10:55.132
Works with me at the store.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.481
Hey.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.222
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing, it's cool.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.789
We're gonna check out
some guns.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.095
- Great.
- Yeah.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.053
- Why are you following us?

11:03.097 --> 11:06.317
- I saw my friend walking away
with two strange guys.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.492
It's girl code, bro.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.322
Let's see these guns.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.805
- Okay, then.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.503
- Yeah.
- Come on.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.681
They're over here.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.465
- Really playing it safe.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.685
- On my way out to you now.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.043
Where we at, man?

11:36.086 --> 11:38.262
- Disappeared behind
the pavilion.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.221
Doing a deal behind
a truck in the back.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.831
- We don't have enough guys
to cover this.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.529
- Okay. Let's see some cash.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.357
- Let's see some merchandise.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.752
- Guns are in the box.

11:49.796 --> 11:50.971
Don't move!

11:51.014 --> 11:52.755
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands up!

11:52.799 --> 11:54.104
- Take out your phones,
drop 'em on the ground!

11:54.148 --> 11:55.715
- All right, all right
- In the truck.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.978
- Put your phone on the ground.
Phone on the ground now.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.631
- Move, move. Move it.
- Get in.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.300
- I don't want to hear
any more.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.780
- Get out.
- Out.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.303
- All right.
What're you guys doing?

12:19.347 --> 12:20.914
- Whoa!
- This is insane! You guys!

12:20.957 --> 12:23.177
- What do we got?
Come on.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.006
- Five hundred bucks.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.051
- You gotta be...

12:28.095 --> 12:30.575
What're you talking about?

12:35.929 --> 12:37.974
I thought you had 20 grand.
- What are you talking about?

12:38.018 --> 12:39.802
- You lied to the wrong man.
- I didn't lie to you.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.282
- Yeah, you did.
- No, when did I lie?

12:41.325 --> 12:42.762
I never said I had
the cash on me.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.502
I had to see the product to--
- No, no, no, no.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.113
- Listen, if I liked
what I saw,

12:46.156 --> 12:48.115
I was gonna get you the cash.
- I want my 20 grand.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.333
Or I can just shoot
the both of you.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.639
- Okay, take it easy,
take it easy.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.249
- Listen, listen to me,
listen to me, I--

12:52.293 --> 12:53.468
I can get you
the money, I just, I--

12:53.511 --> 12:54.817
I need to call
my brother, okay?

12:54.861 --> 12:55.992
- Where is he?

12:56.036 --> 12:58.908
- He's, like, an hour away
at the store.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.738
- How the hell
did we lose two officers?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.392
- I don't know what happened,
but Jay and Kevin

13:04.435 --> 13:05.741
couldn't get a look
at the pickup's plates.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.221
- Cell phones?

13:07.264 --> 13:08.875
- Atwater found 'em
in the parking lot.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.528
- Right now, our best bet
is video surveillance.

13:10.572 --> 13:11.878
Jay, he got a look at the guy,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.618
so he's going through
footage right now.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.011
Soon as we get a clear image,

13:15.055 --> 13:16.404
I'll run it through
facial recognition.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.884
We can go from there.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.537
- All right, contact
Wisconsin State Police,

13:19.581 --> 13:21.017
have them run those
cell phones for fingerprints.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.627
- Copy that.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.151
- Put these on, make 'em tight.
- Okay.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.805
- No, put 'em on!
- All right.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.458
- Go, go, go, go.
Tighten it up. Tighten it up.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.503
Get 'em on!
- They're tight!

13:28.546 --> 13:29.896
- In the car!

13:31.201 --> 13:33.682
- Be smart about this.
- Shut up.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.902
Get in.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.513
- What about that spiderweb
tattoo Burgess mentioned?

13:38.556 --> 13:39.862
- We ran it--it's popular
with three different

13:39.906 --> 13:40.950
white prison gangs.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.256
Doesn't really narrow
things down.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.779
- I sent Ballistics

13:43.823 --> 13:45.433
the photo of the guns
they were trying to sell.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.043
Maybe they'll find
some identifying markers.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.524
- All right, pack up.
We're going to Wisconsin.

13:51.656 --> 13:54.442
- Get in. Come on.
Shut it.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.660
All right. Go!

13:55.704 --> 13:57.227
- Take it easy.
- Move!

13:57.271 --> 13:58.359
Go on. Go.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.711
- On the floor.
Tie 'em up. Tie 'em up.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.626
On the floor.
- Get down. Get down.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.888
Have a seat.
- Get down!

14:05.932 --> 14:08.456
- Hey, easy, easy!
- Get down.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.805
Whoa, man.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.285
We don't gotta hurt 'em,
all right?

14:11.328 --> 14:12.460
- What'd you say?

14:12.503 --> 14:13.983
You just keep your mouth shut

14:14.027 --> 14:15.985
and you tie 'em up.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.945
- Hey, listen.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.990
You want the money, right,
the 20 grand?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.339
That's not a problem--
all you gotta do

14:22.383 --> 14:23.471
is let me make a phone call.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.212
- Just shut up! Just shut up!

14:25.255 --> 14:27.649
No talking!

14:27.692 --> 14:30.130
And you stay still!

14:30.173 --> 14:32.219
Or I can just kill you both.

14:34.874 --> 14:35.875
Come on.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.888
- What are you doing?

14:48.931 --> 14:50.672
- What do you mean,
what am I doing?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.326
I'm gonna get us out of here.
- No, we sit tight.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.850
The team's gotta be
getting close.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.765
- What are you talking about?
You don't know that.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.811
- Kim, the goal is to stay
alive for as long as possible.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.509
And right now, the best way
to do that

15:01.552 --> 15:03.946
is to sit tight
and wait for help.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.733
- What do you got?

15:08.777 --> 15:10.474
- I got that
surveillance picture,

15:10.518 --> 15:11.823
but it's not close enough
for facial rec.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.651
- They've been gone
for over 90 minutes,

15:13.695 --> 15:15.349
so they can be on their way
to Canada for all we know.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.699
- Trudy, tell me you
got something.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.527
- Yeah, lab blew up
the photo of the guns.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.268
Picked up a corner
of the CNC mill.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.661
- Talking about the machine
they use to make the guns?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.881
- Yeah, there's
a serial number on it.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.710
Guy named Spencer Whalen
bought it seven months ago.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.886
He owns a cabin
in southern Wisconsin too.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.453
- All right,
you got an address?

15:32.496 --> 15:33.758
- Just texted it.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.717
Hank, he's 10 miles
from you guys.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.110
- Great work, Trudy.
Thanks.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.981
- I'll take the lead.
- No, Antonio will.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.200
I know what's going on
in your head--

15:40.243 --> 15:41.723
- Boss, I can handle it.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.246
- This isn't about you
right now, Adam,

15:43.290 --> 15:45.770
so just stand down
and follow orders.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.471
Okay, look.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.386
I know at the academy
they teach us

15:52.429 --> 15:54.692
never to reveal ourselves
as police, but...

15:54.736 --> 15:56.694
these guys are amateurs.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.392
I mean, they're not ready
to go the distance

15:58.435 --> 15:59.871
with two Chicago cops.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.830
If we tell them who we are,

16:01.873 --> 16:03.832
there's a really good chance
they could just turn and run.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.442
- Or they get spooked
and do something crazy.

16:05.486 --> 16:06.966
- Hailey, if the team
was following us,

16:07.009 --> 16:08.402
wouldn't you think
they'd be here by now?

16:08.445 --> 16:10.056
- I know.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.754
We need to keep our eyes open
and find the right moment.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.886
Look around. See if--

16:19.587 --> 16:23.156
- Here. Call your brother
on this phone.

16:26.768 --> 16:31.077
- There's no service.
- Son of a bitch.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.080
Hey. You get a signal
out there?

16:34.123 --> 16:35.646
- No.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.083
I had one coming in, though,
back on the main road.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.259
Yo, I think I just heard
something outside.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.957
- Well, go check it out.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.327
- Sarge, the truck's
got an alarm on it.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.590
- Good, we'll draw him out,
then, breach the structure.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.114
Let's move.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.309
- Down! Don't move!
- Get down!

17:29.352 --> 17:30.962
Get on the table!

17:31.006 --> 17:32.964
- Kim! Hailey! Sound off!
- Where are the girls at, huh?

17:33.008 --> 17:34.618
Huh? Huh?
- Son of a bitch.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.273
- You better stay right there.
- Hailey! Kim!

17:37.317 --> 17:39.232
- Stay right there.
You better not move.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.668
- I got the guns.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.020
- No sign of 'em.
- Stay right there. Don't move.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.630
- Where are the women?
- What women?

17:46.674 --> 17:49.155
- Wrong answer.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.505
I won't ask again.
- Where are they?

17:51.548 --> 17:52.680
You have three seconds
to answer.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.682
One, two!
- Hold on, hold on.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.510
Hold on, hold on! These weren't
the guys that they left with.

17:56.553 --> 17:57.902
- The hell are you
talking about?

17:57.946 --> 17:59.687
- They weren't at the show.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.906
We were doing the deal
with someone else.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.344
- If these guys
don't have 'em...

18:04.387 --> 18:05.823
- Who the hell does?

18:10.176 --> 18:12.134
- I'm not saying anything else
till I get out of here

18:12.178 --> 18:13.440
and I get a--

18:13.483 --> 18:15.006
- Two of your associates
used this photo

18:15.050 --> 18:16.051
to set up a buy
with our officers.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.226
These are your guns.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.706
Right, Spencer?

18:18.749 --> 18:20.447
Who are your guys,
who are you working with?

18:20.490 --> 18:22.144
- If I ask for a lawyer,
don't you gotta get me one?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.015
Isn't that, like, a rule?

18:24.059 --> 18:25.887
- Here's the thing.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.151
The two officers who went
to do the buy are missing.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.936
And when cops go missing,

18:31.980 --> 18:33.634
all the rules go out
the window.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.160
- Got a lot of tools here.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.858
- Who're you working with?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.338
Just give us the names
of your associates.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.035
- I don't have
other associates.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.083
- That's the wrong answer.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.696
You got one more chance.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.351
- I don't have other associates
or whatever.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.874
I swear to God, I don't!

18:56.918 --> 18:58.093
It's just me and my cousin.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.529
- You never seen this guy
before?

18:59.573 --> 19:00.922
We got him on surveillance
at the gun show

19:00.965 --> 19:02.315
with a picture of your guns.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
You never seen him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

19:04.143 --> 19:05.970
Tall guy.
Looks like this dude--

19:06.014 --> 19:07.276
he goes by the name of Red.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.061
I met him once like a week ago.
I swear.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.933
- What else can you tell us
about him?

19:11.976 --> 19:13.064
- He's got a tattoo--

19:13.108 --> 19:14.544
a spiderweb on his hands.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.329
- Did you meet him?
Did you sell him guns?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.982
- I tr--I tried to.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.375
I texted him that picture

19:19.419 --> 19:20.768
so he could see what
the guns looked like.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.813
I texted it, but he never
got back to me,

19:22.857 --> 19:24.989
I swear. I swear!

19:25.033 --> 19:26.382
- Cuff him.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.905
- Get on the ground.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.820
On the ground.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.387
What do you think?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.433
- I think the guys who took
Kim and Hailey, they--

19:33.476 --> 19:35.913
they don't have any guns.
All they got is that picture.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.393
They're scam artists.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.570
This whole thing was a robbery
from the get-go.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.269
- Get up. Get up!
- Get up!

19:50.493 --> 19:51.929
- You get a signal yet?

19:51.973 --> 19:54.193
- No. Keep walking.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.588
- Gotta say, most guys
wouldn't pick a gun show

19:58.632 --> 19:59.850
to do a robbery.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.810
- People with guns feel
like they're safe.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.942
Makes 'em vulnerable.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.683
- Good point.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.163
You're a smart guy.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.730
Seems like there should
be easier ways

20:09.773 --> 20:11.079
for you to make a living.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.516
- I'm not the one who's trying
to buy illegal guns.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.127
I'm just taking
what I deserve.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.781
- You think you, uh,
deserve my money?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.783
- Yeah. I do.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.003
You're a woman.
World takes care of you.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.700
I don't have the same options.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.616
My family poured our blood
into the Easton Company.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.663
Three generations.
Bastards packed up and they--

20:29.706 --> 20:31.578
they moved to China.

20:31.621 --> 20:36.060
They killed a whole class of
American workers for what...

20:36.104 --> 20:37.888
two pennies a unit?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.720
Don't look at me like that.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.374
- I'm not. I'm just sorry.
I just, you know--

20:45.418 --> 20:47.289
just trying to--please don't!
Please don't!

20:47.333 --> 20:50.031
- Don't look at me like that!
- Oh, God!

20:50.074 --> 20:52.990
I was just--I was just
trying to understand.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.862
- Shhh.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.216
Now, walk.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.574
- There's no reason

21:11.618 --> 21:13.446
they should be in
this situation, not at all.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.143
You guys should have been
all over them.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.405
- What? Were you there?

21:16.449 --> 21:18.146
Were you there?

21:18.189 --> 21:19.408
- No.
- No.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.410
So you don't know
what went down.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.194
You just keep your mouth shut.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wisconsin area code.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.206
- Okay, put it on speaker.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.036
Yeah, hello?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.343
- Hey, bro, it's me,
your favorite sister, Sarah.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.692
I need a favor.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.346
- Yeah, yeah,
what is it this time?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.827
- Um, the guns,
they look really good.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.699
Really good, so I'm gonna need
you to get the cash together.

21:49.743 --> 21:50.918
20 grand.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.094
- 20 grand. Okay, yeah,
I can do that.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.617
Where do you wanna meet?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.532
- There's a pizza joint
on Addison and Baldwin.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.055
You know it?
- I'll find you.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.535
Um, you there right now?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.407
- No, I'm gonna send
one of the guys

22:01.450 --> 22:03.104
that I met, a supplier.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.236
He'll take the money and then
he'll get you the guns.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.542
- Well, where will you be?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.631
- I'm just hanging out
at their cabin.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.372
- Their cabin? Cabin where?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.505
- Um, I have no idea.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.377
Just... don't worry.
These guys are great.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
There's nothing
to worry about, okay?

22:16.900 --> 22:18.685
- Okay. If you say so.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.122
Get that money together,
and I'll be there ASAP.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.558
- And if you're short on cash,

22:22.602 --> 22:24.386
um, I have some stashed
in my locker at the gym.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.257
Same combo as always.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.609
- Okay, great.
- You know my gym, right?

22:29.652 --> 22:32.263
- Yeah, yeah, but I'm good
on cash.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.917
Good on the cash.
- Okay.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.876
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.268
Just text this number
when you have the cash,

22:37.312 --> 22:38.269
and we'll set up
a time to meet.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.706
- I will.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.927
- Adam, what's the name
of Kim's gym?

22:43.971 --> 22:45.233
- Uh, Easton Gym.
- Uh, Easton Fitness.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.582
- Easton Fitness.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.627
- Okay, so she's giving us
a hint.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.019
- All right, loop in Platt,

22:49.063 --> 22:50.281
have her cross-reference
the name Easton

22:50.325 --> 22:51.761
with all the pieces we got.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.850
Run an emergency ping
on that phone number too.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.591
- Uh, what do you wanna do
about the money?

22:55.635 --> 22:57.158
- I'll arrange a 1505
wire transfer.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.681
- Good.
- Boss.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.422
I know you want me to sit in
the background on this one,

23:00.466 --> 23:02.293
but here, my voice on the
phone, I think it's gotta be--

23:02.337 --> 23:03.686
- Okay, fine.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.645
Just play it the way
I tell you to play it.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.429
- All right, thank you.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.401
- Thank you.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.619
Hey, wait.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.795
Can you please redo
my zip ties?

23:25.839 --> 23:27.710
Please?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.190
Please.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.758
They're so tight, I can barely
feel my hands.

23:33.281 --> 23:34.761
Please.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.940
Thank you.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.857
My name's Ally.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.515
If you don't mind me asking,

23:49.558 --> 23:52.474
how are you gonna explain this
to your wife?

23:52.518 --> 23:53.867
- My wife?

23:53.910 --> 23:57.653
- Hey, you got a ring on.
I assume you're married.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.960
- Yeah, she don't gotta know
about any of this.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.831
- Yeah, well...

24:01.875 --> 24:03.354
if you love her, you might want
to think this through

24:03.398 --> 24:04.834
a little better.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.532
Your friend goes off the rails
and kills us,

24:06.575 --> 24:08.011
that's your life.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.970
You're never gonna see
your wife again.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.019
But if you go to the police,

24:16.063 --> 24:18.892
you get ahead of this thing,
you tell them what's going on,

24:18.935 --> 24:21.590
there's a good chance you can
walk away from it.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.679
- You think I'm stupid?
- No.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.855
I think you're smart.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.770
And I think you love your wife.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.382
If you go the police and you
tell them what's going on,

24:31.426 --> 24:33.210
there's a good chance you can
walk away from this

24:33.254 --> 24:34.647
like nothing ever happened.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.127
But if this goes sideways,

24:37.171 --> 24:40.391
dude, you're looking at
life in prison, for what?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.219
Ooh, okay.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.220
Okay.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.527
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.921
I was just trying to help.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.672
Can you please just
redo my zip ties?

25:21.911 --> 25:24.827
- Stupid bitch.
You think you can play me?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.482
- Hank, I chased down Easton.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.746
I think Burgess was trying to
put us onto Easton Industries,

25:30.790 --> 25:33.096
an auto parts factory
near Milwaukee.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.185
- I'm just not sure
how that helps us.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.187
- I wasn't either,
but we know one of the men

25:37.231 --> 25:38.537
has a prison tattoo.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.408
I searched for former
Easton employees

25:40.451 --> 25:41.931
that might have done time
recently.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.454
I talked to the personnel
director,

25:43.498 --> 25:45.021
and he gave me a name:

25:45.065 --> 25:45.935
Logan Gaines.

25:45.979 --> 25:48.590
I'm sending you his mug shot.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.377
- That's him.
- Gaines did two years

25:53.421 --> 25:54.640
at the Wisconsin State Prison

25:54.683 --> 25:56.250
for aggravated battery.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.992
He beat the crap out of
his supervisor at Easton.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.471
He's got a history
of violence.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.082
- You got an LKA?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.387
- No, nothing current.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.650
No recent phone or credit card.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.608
He might be living
off the grid.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.610
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Hey.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.177
Got the money.
We're good to go.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.135
- All right, let's do this.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.703
- Hey.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.925
What the hell are you
doing out here?

26:18.968 --> 26:19.969
Move it.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.624
I told you
not to leave her alone.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.584
- Don't worry.
She ain't going nowhere.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.764
- Go inside.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.773
- You just wait here.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.731
Okay?

26:42.775 --> 26:45.342
I'll get that money
from your brother.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.518
You'll be free to go.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.224
You pull something
like that again...

26:57.267 --> 27:00.053
I'll put a bullet in your head.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.017
- Hailey!

27:09.715 --> 27:11.194
- Hey.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.937
- Oh, God, Hailey,
what happened?

27:14.981 --> 27:17.897
I thought the plan was to wait
for the right moment.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.812
- I know.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.204
I found the right moment.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.380
It just didn't
really go as planned.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.948
- Well, the phone call did.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.559
Okay? They're setting up
a meet right now.

27:28.603 --> 27:31.214
So we are back on plan.
We sit tight.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.347
We wait for the team.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.131
That's good.

27:35.175 --> 27:38.395
- Yeah, that's good.
- Okay.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.190
- All right, we're in position.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.192
Should be here any minute.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.935
- Antonio?

27:55.978 --> 27:57.414
- Nothing yet.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.678
- Right, you got any movement
out back, Jay?

27:59.721 --> 28:01.723
- Stand by.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.204
I got a blue pickup truck
on the street.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.206
This could be our guy.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.045
- All right, he's headed
toward you now, Adam.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.481
Remember, tracker's
in the back.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.049
Just let him walk out,
take it from there.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.181
- Copy that.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.537
- You Chris?

28:33.581 --> 28:34.321
- I am.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.714
How you doin', man?

28:35.757 --> 28:36.715
- You got the payment?

28:42.459 --> 28:44.766
Your product better be legit.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.768
- Yeah. It is.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.121
- Good?
- Yeah.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.255
- Whoa.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.126
What happened to your hand?

28:58.127 --> 29:00.216
- Was a bar fight.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.783
- Bar fight?
- Yeah.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.611
- I swear to God, if something
happened to my sister--

29:03.654 --> 29:06.309
- No, she's fine.
She's fine.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.796
- All right, she better be.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.494
All right.

29:17.538 --> 29:20.236
Good doing business with you.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.155
- Yo, he with you?

29:26.199 --> 29:28.767
- That thug look
like a friend of mine?

29:33.554 --> 29:34.947
Kevin!

29:34.990 --> 29:36.644
- He's on the move!

29:36.687 --> 29:38.385
- Move in!

29:42.693 --> 29:45.174
- Hold it!
Stop right there!

29:51.441 --> 29:53.139
- You all right?
Are you okay?

29:53.182 --> 29:55.097
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.882
No, no, no, no, no, no...

30:09.459 --> 30:12.332
- This is taking too long.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.855
We're sitting here
waiting to die.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.291
That's a bad strategy.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.598
- Yeah, I agree.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.341
- Okay.

30:24.648 --> 30:25.911
Hey.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.826
That chain.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.392
Try and kick it to me.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.432
- ID'd the offender
as Billy Mays.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.391
He's got no previous record.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.522
- Cell phone?

31:12.566 --> 31:14.176
- It was destroyed on impact.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.352
- I just checked the truck.
He doctored the damn plates.

31:16.396 --> 31:17.397
But the registration
on the inside

31:17.440 --> 31:18.964
is definitely tied to Billy.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.400
- But check it out--just talked
to a local connect

31:20.443 --> 31:21.749
off the record.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.968
Milwaukee police triangulated
the call

31:23.011 --> 31:24.186
Burgess made to Ruzek

31:24.230 --> 31:25.840
with a trap-and-trace.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.450
The call pinged off a cell
tower about 10 miles away.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.017
- So what's near
that cell tower?

31:29.061 --> 31:30.758
- Nothing but woods, Sarge.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.586
It's gonna be hard to pin 'em
down in Kenosha County Park.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.283
- Whoa, whoa.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.895
Same burner from before--his
partner must be getting antsy.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.244
- Answer it.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.593
- Yeah?
- Hey.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.161
Where the hell is my partner?

31:42.204 --> 31:43.814
- Uh, he just got
hauled off, man.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.295
- What are you talking about?
- Cops, man.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.775
What, you steal the car
or something?

31:47.818 --> 31:49.255
- What the hell are you
talking about?

31:49.298 --> 31:52.519
- Look, put my sister
on the line.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.564
- She's not available.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.783
- All right, hey, we still
want to do this deal.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.611
We still want those guns,
so you...

31:57.654 --> 31:59.265
you know, you tell me
where you are,

31:59.308 --> 32:01.658
I got the money,
I'll come meet you.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.182
- Deal's off.
- No, hold on.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.575
Don't be stupid. Hey.

32:05.619 --> 32:06.837
Hey!

32:06.881 --> 32:08.622
- All right,
let's hit those woods.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.973
We'll fan out, find this prick
the old-fashioned way.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.633
It's okay.

32:24.507 --> 32:27.380
- Good job.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.035
You got it, you got it.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.044
- You got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.791
- Give me your hands.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.057
Okay, we'll get you
out of here.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.936
- You're not gonna be able
to break this.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.590
Listen, you gotta
get out of here.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.071
Listen to me.
You need to go call Voight.

33:06.114 --> 33:09.857
Hey! I'm the ranking officer.
That's an order.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.903
Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

33:12.947 --> 33:15.602
- If you don't go, we both die.
- Then we both die.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.780
- Okay, stop.
If you're not gonna go,

33:19.823 --> 33:22.478
then we have to find a way
to get people to us.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.350
Okay?
- Okay.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.004
- Okay.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.489
I saw something.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.671
Matches?
- Yeah.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.891
We light a fire.
- Attract attention.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.371
- Scare these idiots away
at the same time.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.547
- Great.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.277
- Hank, we're coming off
the Silver Lake Trail.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.887
Heading east.
- Copy.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.064
We're circling from the west.

34:27.891 --> 34:28.936
- We'll find 'em.

34:28.979 --> 34:31.460
- We better.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.951
Where is your friend?

35:27.995 --> 35:30.128
- You can go to hell.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.825
It's over.
- No.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.175
No, no, no, no, no.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.134
I'm just getting started.

35:41.748 --> 35:42.749
Ah!

35:42.792 --> 35:45.404
- Hey! What is this?

35:45.447 --> 35:47.406
What is it?

35:47.449 --> 35:49.799
It's a vest?

35:52.019 --> 35:53.325
- Jesus, you're a cop.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.804
You're a cop.
- I am a cop.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.632
- Yeah? Yeah?

35:56.676 --> 35:58.156
- My friend's a cop too.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.287
And they're gonna come
looking for us,

35:59.331 --> 36:01.159
and we both know
what you look like.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.422
Even if you kill me,
you're done.

36:03.465 --> 36:04.466
You're done!

36:07.861 --> 36:10.168
- Yo, you see that? Fire.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.025
- Hailey, I have him.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.376
Hailey, let go!

36:44.419 --> 36:46.204
Hey!
- It's us, stand down!

36:46.247 --> 36:47.683
Stand down!

36:51.296 --> 36:52.688
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.560
- Let him go, Hailey.
Hailey, let him go.

36:54.603 --> 36:58.825
- Hailey. Hey. It's us.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.305
- Hey.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.220
- That's enough.
That's enough.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.701
- That's enough.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.488
Come here. Come here.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.056
- Put your hands out.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.449
- Boss, we found 'em.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.190
Uh, we need an EMT,
right now.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.236
- Thank God.
Copy that.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.107
- Hey.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.892
- Boss, we got him.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.422
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.729
- Hey.

37:33.773 --> 37:34.730
- I'm good.

37:34.774 --> 37:37.037
- All right, uh...

37:37.080 --> 37:39.822
well, I mean, first of all,

37:39.866 --> 37:43.348
obviously, we're all very happy
Kim and Hailey are okay.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.353
Look, what happened today...

37:48.396 --> 37:50.920
it cannot happen again.

37:50.964 --> 37:54.663
Okay, we don't take
those kind of risks.

37:54.707 --> 37:56.752
I mean, the object
of this game, it's--

37:56.796 --> 37:59.146
it's simple.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.017
We come home.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.324
Alive.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.631
There's never gonna be
a case or a criminal

38:05.674 --> 38:08.024
that is gonna trump that, ever.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.374
You understand?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.160
Now, I realize

38:13.203 --> 38:14.857
we all have private lives.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.337
We exist...

38:16.381 --> 38:19.949
we exist as people
outside this building.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.038
But when we are here working,

38:22.082 --> 38:24.954
we are one team
with one purpose,

38:24.998 --> 38:26.173
period.

38:29.829 --> 38:34.355
And no matter what's going on
at home, good or bad...

38:34.399 --> 38:36.139
it's gotta stay at home.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.163
- Hail?

39:00.207 --> 39:02.165
Hey, what'd the doctor say?

39:02.209 --> 39:04.211
- All good.
- Yeah?

39:04.254 --> 39:07.170
Really?
- Yeah, on the mend.

39:07.214 --> 39:08.563
- That's good. You look great.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.654
- How's your throat?

39:12.698 --> 39:14.569
- Never better.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.231
- There's something
I gotta say.

39:33.153 --> 39:36.069
- All right.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.679
Over whiskey?

39:45.861 --> 39:47.646
- Okay.

39:47.689 --> 39:51.084
Why I didn't tell you
about Adam and I.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.216
- Yeah.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.787
- I dated a cop
in my unit before.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.311
He was a sergeant.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.357
And while he and I
were together,

40:03.401 --> 40:04.663
I was meritoriously promoted

40:04.706 --> 40:07.883
for an undercover case
I was working.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.669
The case was
never closed, so...

40:10.712 --> 40:13.323
I couldn't tell anyone
about it.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.632
I earned that promotion.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.592
Everyone just assumed it was
because of my boyfriend.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.898
He called in a favor.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.946
- That sucks.

40:28.991 --> 40:30.428
- I learned the hard way

40:30.471 --> 40:33.082
that I had to keep
my personal life private.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.873
So, I wasn't too excited
about everyone finding out

40:40.916 --> 40:42.178
about Adam and I.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.269
- Hmm.

40:46.313 --> 40:49.882
I get it. I get it.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.022
We're good, Hailey.
