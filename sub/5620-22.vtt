All right, well, uh,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.458
better get that phone then, huh?

07:40.542 --> 07:42.333
Uh, let me pull up
the phone tracking app,

07:42.417 --> 07:44.041
and we will see what's up.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.125
(chuckles) Come on.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.959
(knocking, sighs)

07:47.041 --> 07:48.041
Quick and painless.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.583
We're all adults here.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.125
(sighs)

07:54.458 --> 07:56.125
Hey.
Hey.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.375
What is this?

07:58.458 --> 07:59.583
Grab that end--
we'll walk it in.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.041
Uh, I-I thought

08:01.125 --> 08:02.542
you were moving in next week.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.166
I know, I know, I was,
but I got excited.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.875
As soon as I finished
this thing,

08:05.959 --> 08:07.000
I wanted to come
and bring it to you.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.041
You made this for me?
Yeah.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.959
I just wanted some way
to show you how grateful I am

08:11.041 --> 08:12.041
to have you in my life.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.875
Let's just do this
on three. Ready?

08:13.959 --> 08:15.875
One, two...

08:15.959 --> 08:17.125
Craig, we need to talk.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.583
Oh.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.625
Hi.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.625
Hi.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.625
We should talk.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.083
Can I go first?

08:25.166 --> 08:27.500
I have to go to New York tonight
for five days,

08:27.583 --> 08:29.792
and I know you are wondering how
you're gonna survive without me,

08:29.875 --> 08:32.083
so I brought you
a little care package.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.667
That's sweet.
Catherine, I've been thinking...

08:34.750 --> 08:36.667
You made me cookies?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.875
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I had Wolfgang Puck do it,

08:38.959 --> 08:41.041
but I told him no nuts,
because, as you say,

08:41.125 --> 08:42.417
then it's not dessert anymore.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.917
It's not dessert anymore, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.166
All right.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.583
You got me money?

08:47.667 --> 08:49.083
Well, it's cash.
I was gonna buy you

08:49.166 --> 08:50.417
those Tom Ford shoes you like,
but I know

08:50.500 --> 08:51.959
you love going
into the store yourself.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.709
I know one day
he's gonna show up.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.875
Tom.
Yeah, he is.
And, uh,

08:55.959 --> 08:57.709
there's one more thing.

08:57.792 --> 08:58.542
You got me a phone?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.667
No, uh, actually,

09:00.750 --> 09:03.125
there's an appointment in there
for next week

09:03.208 --> 09:06.125
to tell you that I love you.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.417
That gives me time
to muster up the confidence

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
and gives you time to prepare
any questions or comments

09:10.583 --> 09:13.583
that you may have. So...

09:13.667 --> 09:15.750
Wow.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.166
Catherine...

09:17.250 --> 09:19.750
(stammering)

09:19.834 --> 09:22.792
You are wonderful.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.333
Well, I already knew that.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.834
Yeah.
(laughs)

09:25.917 --> 09:27.125
Oh, okay.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.166
Let's have some
of these cookies.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.750
Okay.

09:30.834 --> 09:33.125
I'll be right there.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.583
Excuse me.

09:35.667 --> 09:36.792
Are you gonna order?

09:36.875 --> 09:38.125
From this dump? No.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.125
I'm only here because
of an elaborate proposal

09:40.208 --> 09:41.750
I got roped into
because I'm weak.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.125
Crap.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.166
Gotta go.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.667
Hey, isn't this the, uh,

09:45.750 --> 09:47.959
place we ate the very first time
we hung out?

09:48.041 --> 09:50.250
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.166
(chuckles) I remember
I was so nervous.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.458
You know I wrote
conversation topics on my palm?

09:54.542 --> 09:56.041
Vanessa?

09:56.125 --> 09:58.625
Hey! Which one of you jabronies
stole my phone?

09:58.709 --> 10:00.250
Speak up or I'll deep-fry
your face.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.458
I will eat you.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.166
Okay, thank you.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.792
Let's just check
the phone tracking app again.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.583
Oh, it's not here anymore.
We should go.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.166
Thank you, Señor Plucky's.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.000
Number four, ranchero style.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.041
That's us.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.166
JIMMY:
<i>I mean, I have to be honest.</i>

10:15.250 --> 10:16.750
I haven't always been
a good guy.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.166
I've messed up.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.083
I've made mistakes.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.250
But now I could get Sara back.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.750
Is that a mistake?

10:22.834 --> 10:24.458
Catherine is such
a wonderful person.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.208
And she challenges me,
and according to her,

10:26.291 --> 10:28.125
she's gonna be
in love with me next week.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.208
Do I give all that up for Sara?
What if it doesn't work out?

10:30.291 --> 10:31.500
What happens if it doesn't
work out with Sara?

10:31.583 --> 10:33.500
And I mess the whole family up?
Danger.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.208
I mean, am I chasing something
from the past

10:35.291 --> 10:36.458
that maybe
doesn't exist anymore?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.250
I don't know.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.000
I wish Sara would've
just had sex with me.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.792
I'd be thinking
a lot more clear right now.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.208
Yeah.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.375
Yeah.

10:44.458 --> 10:45.834
Why am I even talking to you?

10:45.917 --> 10:47.375
You don't even speak
in complete sentences.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.875
Yeah.
Look at you.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.417
Don't you look cute?

10:50.500 --> 10:51.792
Here, let's put this on.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.959
Oh, your mommy and daddy
are gonna melt.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.125
You know what? Why don't I just
take the mature approach?

10:57.208 --> 10:58.250
Why don't I tell Sara

10:58.333 --> 11:00.000
I haven't broken up
with Catherine yet?

11:00.083 --> 11:01.166
I need more time.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.333
Yes, Grandpa.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.500
Did you just call me Grandpa?

11:04.583 --> 11:05.959
Didn't I tell you
never to call me Grandpa?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.041
Yeah.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.583
You can call me Grandpa.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.250
Okay, Grandpa.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.041
Come on, come on!

11:15.000 --> 11:16.250
Hi.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.417
Hey.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.709
So, the breakup was brutal,
but I did it.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.166
(chuckles)

11:23.250 --> 11:24.959
How'd it go for you?

11:25.041 --> 11:26.625
I did it, too.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.125
Yeah, uh, it was...

11:28.208 --> 11:29.250
Oh, God, it was the worst.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.333
Oh.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.959
Ugh, where are they?

11:36.041 --> 11:38.333
Excuse me, miss?

11:38.417 --> 11:40.125
Would you mind taking
our first family photo?

11:40.208 --> 11:43.041
Why not? I guess
I'm everybody's bitch today.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.375
Finally. Gotta go.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.208
Congrats!

11:50.291 --> 11:52.000
Why did the thief go
to the hospital?

11:52.083 --> 11:55.000
Oh, he knows what
I'm gonna do to him.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.041
You know, maybe he got sick
from Señor Plucky's.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.792
I once saw a guy shaving
in their kitchen.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.125
But, uh, doesn't this place
bring you back?

12:01.208 --> 12:02.875
Feels like yesterday
we were here

12:02.959 --> 12:05.875
meeting Edie
for the first time.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.458
Best day of our lives.

12:07.542 --> 12:08.667
Is that a dead body?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.000
No, I don't think so.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.875
Frank, where do we put
the dead body?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.458
Anyway,

12:14.542 --> 12:16.000
um, I just...

12:16.083 --> 12:17.375
such a magical day.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.000
I remember your smile...

12:19.083 --> 12:20.667
Man, his face looked like
the end of a burrito.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.834
You know, when it starts
falling apart?

12:21.917 --> 12:22.959
(scoffs)
I hate that.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.417
Let's just go find my phone.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.166
Uh, look,
phone's on the move.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.417
Let's do it.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.667
Hey, look at this.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.834
They found his legs.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.375
His family's gonna be thrilled.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.041
(chuckles)

12:34.125 --> 12:36.000
Whew.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.041
I gotta tell you,
I don't know what was worse.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.875
Breaking up with Craig
or seeing a man

12:39.959 --> 12:42.083
wipe away his tears
with a leather wristband.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.792
Whew.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.667
Oh, I said so much.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.041
You know, it was just like
a flood came out.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.333
I said to her,
I says, I says,

12:50.417 --> 12:51.750
"Catherine, uh,

12:51.834 --> 12:53.291
"this is where the story ends,

12:53.375 --> 12:54.917
"and there will not
be a sequel,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.583
and Sara is my new story."

12:56.667 --> 12:58.000
I did a whole literary motif.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.083
Very high-brow.

12:59.166 --> 13:03.083
It was, it was not pretty,
but...

13:04.667 --> 13:06.792
...I did it for you.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.709
Wow. That is something

13:08.792 --> 13:10.959
the old Jimmy Martino
could never have done.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.625
I'm a changed man.

13:16.041 --> 13:19.166
I can't believe I'm falling
for Jimmy Martino again.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.083
You're not gonna believe this,
but I think your cell phone

13:23.166 --> 13:24.208
is at the cell phone store

13:24.291 --> 13:25.417
we used to work at.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.291
(groans)
I don't care anymore.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.959
Just take me home.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.959
I have a feeling
it'll be our last stop.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.417
Gerald,
are you listening to me?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.041
I want to go home.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.750
Well, I want a lot of
things, too, Vanessa.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.083
Okay? We're not giving up
on this day.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.542
This day sucks!

13:39.625 --> 13:41.625
What are you... (groans)

13:41.709 --> 13:44.375
Oh, my stomach. Pull over.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.166
Nice try.
Pull over!

13:48.125 --> 13:49.583
(tires squeal)

13:49.667 --> 13:52.083
Are you all right?

13:52.166 --> 13:53.834
Vanessa! Vanessa!

13:53.917 --> 13:55.083
(retching)

13:55.166 --> 13:56.125
Oh, Vaness...

13:56.208 --> 13:58.500
Why did I eat
that Señor Plucky's?

13:58.583 --> 14:00.083
You all right, bab...?

14:00.166 --> 14:01.250
Oh, God.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.125
(both retching)

14:04.208 --> 14:06.000
Oh, I think that's a lung.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.667
Everyone, Gerald just sent me
a message.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.959
Why he sent it to me,
I have no idea.

14:15.041 --> 14:17.291
I don't do family drama.
Which is why I told...

14:17.375 --> 14:18.834
Annelise, what's the message?

14:18.917 --> 14:21.125
Right, Gerald regrets
to inform you

14:21.208 --> 14:23.125
that he and Vanessa
are puking up Señor Plucky's

14:23.208 --> 14:24.250
and won't be coming.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.834
(groaning)

14:26.917 --> 14:29.417
Them? I spent five hours
on a SuperShuttle to get here.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.125
Kept taking me to the airport.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.291
What's wrong with you?

14:32.375 --> 14:33.417
All right, Sara, Annelise,

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
let's pack this place up.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.709
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.875
What? No, n-no,
I want to see what Gerald

14:36.959 --> 14:37.875
had planned.
Let's see the show.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.667
Okay.
