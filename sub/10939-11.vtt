than his right,

being just the three of us.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.574
Just the family.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.953
Oh, all right.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.922
Lou, what can l do?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.927
You seem to be doing just fine.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.299
Okay, you can set yourself another place.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.935
Just promise me
you won't talk so much, okay?

13:23.035 --> 13:24.437
You know, the way you do.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.805
My lips are sealed.

13:25.905 --> 13:26.272
Okay.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.863
What about Ty?

13:31.243 --> 13:35.448
l was thinking we could do, um, trail
rides aimed at a corporate clientele.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.883
You know, like,
what you can learn from a horse...

13:37.983 --> 13:39.852
...that'll make you a better executive.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.654
lt's all about branding, really.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.239
And not the kind that involves hot irons.

13:45.958 --> 13:50.224
l get it. Horses and executives,
both full of crap.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.599
l mean, it's, it's,
it's about teamwork.

13:53.699 --> 13:57.169
You know, uh, letting go. Knowing
when to lead, when to follow.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.370
Overcoming fears.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.140
l mean, they do team-building exercises...

14:01.240 --> 14:02.975
...with rock climbing,
fire-walking, and--

14:03.075 --> 14:06.078
Yeah, yeah, Lou, l think
you're onto something.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.280
So, Amy, when are we gonna' see
you jump Spartan?

14:08.380 --> 14:09.849
Well, l'm going to an arena later today.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.218
You can come if you want to watch.
You don't have to.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.954
Can you guys at least wait
until we've had dessert?

14:15.054 --> 14:17.054
l'll help you.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.753
Me too.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.429
So, Mr. Fleming...

14:31.537 --> 14:34.870
Tim. Just, you can call me Tim.

14:34.974 --> 14:38.501
Okay, Tim.
l've heard a lot about you.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.274
l mean, the drugs, the accident,
the rehab.

14:42.381 --> 14:47.481
And don't even get me started
about all that stuff with Jack.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.123
Oh.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.094
Oh, Jack, this is heaven.

14:57.196 --> 15:01.333
l don't get a lot of opportunity
to bring company up here much.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.968
Well, you couldn't have picked
a better person.

15:03.068 --> 15:09.188
Because there's just nothing l like
more than to do a little fly fish...

15:09.475 --> 15:11.076
...l can see that.

15:11.176 --> 15:14.168
All right. Busted.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.486
Okay, l see now that maybe
they'd have taken us...

15:20.586 --> 15:22.755
...to the arena with them
if l just kept a little quieter.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.557
l just don't know why he got so huffy.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.393
l mean, it's not like it's a big secret.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.396
Actually, Mallory,
l'm glad you said what you did.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.197
You are?

15:31.297 --> 15:35.791
Yeah, l was thinking, ah,
you busy this afternoon?

15:36.402 --> 15:40.736
You mean, me and you?

15:40.839 --> 15:44.409
Does this have anything to do with... moo?

15:47.212 --> 15:49.212
This one looks good.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.214
Looks good for what?

15:51.216 --> 15:53.912
Watch and learn.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.235
Come on, cow.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.132
Come on, cow.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.214
Bull's eye.

16:22.314 --> 16:26.734
l'd be more impressed
if it was actually mooooo-ving.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.188
Come on, buddy.
Come on, let's go.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.436
Oh, no.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.256
There must be an easier way to do this.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.778
Like ordering fish at a nice restaurant.

16:55.781 --> 16:59.239
Look, l'm... l caught a tree.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.289
Hang on, l'll give you...
l'll give you a hand there.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.823
Ohhh.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.325
Oh, what did you catch?

17:06.425 --> 17:09.428
Look at my beginner's luck.
- Oh, look at you. You've got, well...

17:09.528 --> 17:10.262
...l'll go get it.

17:10.362 --> 17:14.700
No, that's all right. Just...
We'll just leave it here for now.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.132
Set her down there.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.103
Sorry.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.471
That's okay.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.631
Why don't you try my rod right here?

17:24.542 --> 17:25.877
Here we go.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.180
Now, take the rod in your right hand.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.415
Like this...?

17:29.515 --> 17:31.515
Uh, no.

17:31.617 --> 17:32.084
No.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.839
Uh, you gotta hold it a little more, um...

17:35.921 --> 17:37.656
Up here, like this?

17:37.756 --> 17:43.251
Kinda, put the, turn your,
oh, what the hell, here.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.163
Oh, okay.

17:44.263 --> 17:47.460
You don't mind?
- No, l don't mind.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.729
Okay, right over this way.
There you go.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.507
l didn't know fishing was a team sport.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.607
Me neither.

17:58.343 --> 18:02.177
Okay, now, what we wanna do,

18:02.281 --> 18:05.150
get your line wet a little bit there.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.787
And back and forth. Now strip
a little bit out at the same time.

18:08.887 --> 18:12.825
You pick a spot in the water
and drop it right there.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.659
Ha.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.989
Perfect aim.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.864
Now strip the line in
as it goes down the river.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.964
All right.

18:22.634 --> 18:30.837
Strip it in, follow the line down
with the tip of your rod, and...

18:30.943 --> 18:31.910
There we go.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.746
Okay, l'm fishing.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.246
You are fishing.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.583
Uh-oh.

18:37.683 --> 18:38.917
What's happening?

18:39.017 --> 18:40.085
ls it stuck?

18:40.185 --> 18:41.820
Oh, it's stuck again.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.023
No. You just caught yourself a fish.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.224
Oh, really?
- Yes, you did.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.191
Did l?

18:46.291 --> 18:46.725
Yeah.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.825
Ah.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.978
Okay, there you go.
Reel it in.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.244
Good, Amy.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.417
That looks good.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.157
But you can tell that horse
has a lot more jump in it.

19:18.257 --> 19:21.160
lt's not him that has a problem
with the height. lt's me.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.095
l mean, l've been working him
over these low fences,

19:23.195 --> 19:26.995
just until l feel like we're more of a team.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.626
You know,
when mom used to coach me,

19:30.736 --> 19:33.138
she could talk me through anything.

19:33.238 --> 19:33.939
And if that didn't work,

19:34.039 --> 19:38.744
she'd just hop up on my horse
and show me how it was done.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.447
Lou, why don't you help your sister out?

19:41.547 --> 19:43.682
What are you talking about, Dad?

19:43.782 --> 19:47.513
Well, last l remember,

19:47.619 --> 19:50.289
you got more jumping ribbons
than you could fit on a wall.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.591
Come on, you wanna talk about fearless.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.094
You remember that, uh,
Spencerville Classic?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.929
Do you remember that?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.965
Rain and mud and thunder,
and no way you were gonna scratch.

20:00.065 --> 20:04.103
Yeah, but l don't compete anymore,
Dad. That was ages ago.

20:04.203 --> 20:08.574
And, um, Spartan is really particular
about who rides him.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.819
Well, if Spartan's really particular.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.747
Nah, if you haven't done it
for a while, l understand.

20:15.847 --> 20:19.442
You know, you shouldn't even try.

20:19.551 --> 20:24.523
You should've seen your sister back
in the day. She'd attack those jumps.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.023
Come on, Lou.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.024
When you see Amy up here,

20:26.124 --> 20:28.927
don't you feel like getting back
in the saddle again?

20:29.027 --> 20:31.630
l understand if you haven't
done it for a while,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.730
and you're afraid.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.168
You afraid?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.737
No.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.203
Hey, uh, give me a leg up,
would you?

20:58.790 --> 21:00.526
Lou, this is crazy.
Just tell him the truth.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.958
Shut up, Amy.

21:03.061 --> 21:08.501
And don't you say a word until l get
this damn horse over a jump.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.174
This isn't a good idea.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.243
Watch.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.251
Uh, wow.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.353
Look at her go.

21:42.901 --> 21:46.860
Rider 5 1 2, Tim Fleming.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.678
Daddy.

21:59.885 --> 22:03.844
Yeah. That was great.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.360
TlM: She still had it.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.295
Lou, that was great, hon.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.625
Why don't you try this gate over here?

22:17.035 --> 22:19.035
Lou?

22:22.574 --> 22:24.574
What was that about?

22:35.721 --> 22:36.688
Amy told me.

22:36.788 --> 22:40.492
l swear, Lou, l just never figured
you'd stop riding.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.728
Well, l'm glad you guys finally found
something else to talk about...

22:42.828 --> 22:44.096
...besides horses.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.721
Now you can talk about me.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.499
l just don't get it.

22:49.835 --> 22:53.405
You were on a horse before you could walk.

22:54.139 --> 22:56.139
That was then, Dad.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.519
That was delicious.

23:09.621 --> 23:13.058
Who would ever have guessed that
you were so handy with a frying pan?

23:13.158 --> 23:17.686
Oh, shhh, shhh.
lt's one of my hidden talents.

23:17.963 --> 23:22.868
The mystery of Jack Bartlett,
unfolding before my very eyes.

23:22.968 --> 23:28.304
No mystery, really.
l'm a pretty straightforward guy.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.636
l like working with my hands.

23:31.943 --> 23:37.347
l only shave when the mood
strikes me, and that's not too often.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.818
l've never been on an all-inclusive vacation,

23:39.918 --> 23:43.488
and you couldn't pay me
to get on a cruise ship.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
Can l say the rest?

23:45.190 --> 23:47.283
Sure.

23:47.392 --> 23:52.662
You like horses, sometimes more
than the people that ride them.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.201
You don't see the point
in buying a new truck...

23:56.301 --> 24:00.405
...even though they changed
the model ten years ago.

24:00.505 --> 24:04.407
And even though it seems
where this is going,

24:04.509 --> 24:07.824
you didn't bring me up here to propose.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.647
Well, that's the thing.

24:14.753 --> 24:19.598
l, uh, you know, l haven't done
a lot of... socializing...

24:19.658 --> 24:22.957
...since my wife died.

24:23.061 --> 24:29.694
And, uh, and if l do, well, it's,
we were married a lot of years.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.235
Good years.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.200
How did you meet?

24:38.844 --> 24:44.214
Well, she was a singer
in a roadhouse band,

24:44.316 --> 24:50.152
following the rodeo circuit, every
town from Barrhead to Longview.

24:50.722 --> 24:54.283
And l was at every show...

24:54.392 --> 24:58.997
...until l got busted up
by a bucking horse in High River.

24:59.097 --> 25:02.868
Ended up with a cast on my leg.
l couldn't drive my truck.

25:02.968 --> 25:06.538
Oh, no, you must have hated that,
being chauffeured around.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.018
Yeah. l had to take the bus.

25:09.207 --> 25:12.544
l still made her show in Millarville though.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.959
And that's when she finally noticed me.

25:17.482 --> 25:19.751
We spent our honeymoon right here.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.887
And then, uh,
and then after the funeral,

25:21.987 --> 25:25.684
l spread her ashes in the river.

25:28.793 --> 25:31.938
That sounds like quite a love affair.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.935
l'm very flattered that you brought me here.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.236
l didn't mean to go on.

25:38.336 --> 25:44.969
But l just don't want any
misunderstandings or surprises...

25:45.076 --> 25:51.481
...if -- whatever this is -- continues
past our little fishing trip here.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.953
Well 'whatever this is,'
l hope it does continue.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.521
Otherwise, l've got
a few hundred dollars worth...

25:56.621 --> 26:01.684
...of fishing equipment l'll never use again.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.827
To whatever it is.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.097
To whatever this is.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.346
Well, look at that.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.283
That's not such a bad idea.

26:25.383 --> 26:30.993
Although the choice of cow leaves
a little something to be desired.

26:46.338 --> 26:52.402
All right, well, l'll, uh,
l guess l'll get going.

26:52.544 --> 26:56.173
Yeah, l guess. See ya.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.782
Bye, Dad.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.882
Okay.

27:03.188 --> 27:06.453
You know, girls, uh...

27:08.093 --> 27:10.328
Just seeing you standing there like that,

27:10.428 --> 27:12.428
the two of you,

27:12.430 --> 27:14.065
it reminds me of how hard it used to be...

27:14.165 --> 27:16.165
...to say good-bye.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.000
Lou, you had all those curls.

27:20.105 --> 27:23.875
Amy, you just wanted to get back
with that pony all the time.

27:23.975 --> 27:28.179
Yeah. l guess you were always
saying good-bye, huh, Dad?

27:28.279 --> 27:31.908
Yeah, yeah, in the rodeo days.

27:32.384 --> 27:38.089
You two were just so small, l could
pick you both up at the same time,

27:38.189 --> 27:43.092
and just breathe you in.

27:43.194 --> 27:50.623
Oh. l thought you were, um,
talking about the big good-bye.

27:50.769 --> 27:54.705
l don't really remember
much hugging back then.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.013
Well...

28:06.284 --> 28:09.721
...l'm not that far
out of reach these days, huh?

28:09.821 --> 28:12.457
Just a couple of miles down the road.

28:12.557 --> 28:17.912
Amy, you get a handle on that
cutting horse, you give me a call.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.000
You know, l see what you're doing.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.647
Tie the horse and the cow together,

28:35.747 --> 28:37.115
and eventually they're just gonna
have to figure out...

28:37.215 --> 28:39.384
...how to deal with one another.

28:39.484 --> 28:44.251
They have to learn to read
all those little signals.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.924
For someone who doesn't want to talk--...

28:46.024 --> 28:50.620
...l just don't want to talk about talking.

28:50.729 --> 28:54.132
l mean, maybe if we just
hang around together,

28:54.232 --> 28:56.598
we'll get used to the idea.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.236
What idea?

28:58.336 --> 29:01.640
You just don't know
when to shut up, do you?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.942
Well, l guess it's easier if you're a horse.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.777
This guy's already got it figured out.

29:05.877 --> 29:09.614
The cow moves his ears, it's like
he's telling him where he's gonna go.

29:09.714 --> 29:11.714
Where she's gonna go.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.983
Whatever.

29:14.552 --> 29:17.288
Where did you get that cow from anyway?

29:17.388 --> 29:18.623
l borrowed it from down the road.

29:18.723 --> 29:20.158
The Vanderheyden's place?

29:20.258 --> 29:22.258
Yeah.

29:22.527 --> 29:24.722
That's a dairy farm.

29:24.963 --> 29:28.057
This is a Jersey cow.
A milk cow.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.702
Come on, Ty,
you were on a cattle drive.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.672
You see any cattle that looked like that?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.969
Well, he's brown.
He's a cow.

29:38.643 --> 29:40.779
And you know,
even though it's a dairy cow,

29:40.879 --> 29:41.980
you take it from somebody else's field,

29:42.080 --> 29:44.149
it's still called cattle rustling.

29:44.249 --> 29:49.482
Yeah, around here,
people have been hung for less.

30:04.002 --> 30:09.599
Well, that was really nice.
l had a really wonderful time.

30:09.707 --> 30:12.510
Yeah, there's nothing
like a day on the river.

30:12.610 --> 30:16.114
And you know,
despite all your obvious flaws,

30:16.214 --> 30:19.184
l wouldn't mind if you called me sometime.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.852
l might just do that.

30:20.952 --> 30:23.011
Okay.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.828
Oh, my.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.501
The whole posse's out.

30:36.601 --> 30:37.969
Some other time.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.069
l guess so.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.540
l'll just grab my gear.

30:48.746 --> 30:49.748
l'll give you a call.

30:49.848 --> 30:55.013
All right. See you soon.
Thank you.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.704
So how was your fishing trip,
Grandpa?

31:05.897 --> 31:09.993
l managed to hook a real beauty.

31:10.501 --> 31:14.403
Despite it being kinda late in the season.

31:28.953 --> 31:32.657
Hey, Grandpa, l'm, uh, l'm making
some tea. You want some?

31:32.757 --> 31:35.590
No, thank you, Amy.

31:35.693 --> 31:42.428
But, you know, l know how much you
enjoy a cup of tea after your supper.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.837
Now, why do l think
it's not just a cup of tea?

31:45.937 --> 31:48.406
Okay. You caught me.
l kinda need a favor.

31:48.506 --> 31:52.443
Well, let's hear it, and then
l'll let you know about the tea.

31:52.543 --> 31:55.008
l kinda need a dozen heifers.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.617
Yeah, Dad brought over this cutting
horse for me to fix, and, well,

31:59.717 --> 32:02.720
l kinda need something for him to cut.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.390
So that explains
the Vanderheyden's milk cow.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.635
Yeah, l, uh, l made Ty take her back.

32:09.093 --> 32:12.748
They're not gonna press charges
or anything.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.035
Sure, sure.
l'll find you some heifers.

32:17.135 --> 32:17.735
Thanks.

32:17.835 --> 32:22.329
Just, uh, don't tell your dad
they came from me.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.473
Of course.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.546
Hey, what happened to my tea?

32:28.646 --> 32:31.621
What happened on your fishing trip?

32:32.383 --> 32:35.477
You want those cows or not?

32:37.021 --> 32:41.092
These cows aren't gonna hurt ya.
They're afraid of you.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.394
You don't need to be afraid of them.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.860
That's a good boy.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.901
Hey, what's wrong with this guy?
ls he spooked or something?

32:50.001 --> 32:51.336
Well, knowing Tim Fleming,

32:51.436 --> 32:54.038
l figure he's been jamming
that horse too hard.

32:54.138 --> 32:54.772
Hmm.

32:54.872 --> 32:57.542
lt's not that Tim doesn't know better.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.382
lt's just patience isn't one of his virtues.

33:01.412 --> 33:03.047
Val, l have to confess,

33:03.147 --> 33:06.251
l'm not sure that Briar Ridge
is the right place for Ben.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.219
But l did want to talk to you about that.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.189
You know, Ben and Ashley
have become quite friendly lately.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.053
Oh, l know Ben likes Ashley.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.927
But l'm not sure that that's a distraction...

33:16.027 --> 33:17.662
...that he needs right now.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.931
People always jump
to conclusions about Ashley.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.966
And maybe sometimes she deserves it.

33:22.066 --> 33:26.935
But l can assure you,
her mind is on one thing these days.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.473
Show jumping.

33:28.573 --> 33:32.243
She's determined
to win the Fall Finale. So...

33:32.343 --> 33:35.141
Oh, hey, Lisa. You know...

33:35.380 --> 33:36.948
You know when l saw your car in the back,

33:37.048 --> 33:38.283
l was afraid you were here...

33:38.383 --> 33:42.053
...to bring all that fishing equipment
back for a refund.

33:42.153 --> 33:45.290
You know what, Maggie?
l think l'm hooked.

33:45.390 --> 33:49.215
Are we talking about fishing
or Jack Bartlett?

33:54.465 --> 33:55.934
[ Knock at the door ]...

33:56.034 --> 33:58.195
...lt's open.

34:01.305 --> 34:04.075
l know l should have phoned, but...

34:04.175 --> 34:06.507
Val.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.839
Do you know, Jack,

34:09.947 --> 34:14.962
l can't recall the last time
you invited me into your house.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.085
A cup of coffee?

34:17.655 --> 34:19.655
Got anything stronger?

34:20.992 --> 34:28.420
Yeah, well, l'm sure l got a bottle
of something here somewhere.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.800
Let me see.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.936
So, l had a long chat with Lisa today.

34:40.445 --> 34:44.047
As you know, her nephew Ben
is training at our place now.

34:44.148 --> 34:47.811
Yeah. Well, hope that works out for him.

34:47.952 --> 34:55.620
l imagine his decision has had quite
an impact on your bottom line, huh?

34:55.726 --> 34:59.423
Well, l guess we'll
muddle through somehow.

35:00.164 --> 35:05.349
But l don't figure you came here
to talk about my bottom line.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.776
Okay.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.548
How long we've been friends, Jack?

35:17.648 --> 35:19.648
10 years? 1 5 years?

35:19.717 --> 35:22.920
And l know we've had our ups and downs.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.454
Yeah. Plenty of those.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.058
Right.

35:27.158 --> 35:34.462
But l still consider you to be
one of my dearest friends.

35:34.565 --> 35:39.593
So l guess l'm a little surprised
that you never told me...

35:39.704 --> 35:41.606
...you and Lisa were a serious item.

35:41.706 --> 35:45.786
Hmm. l had to hear it from Maggie,
of all people.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.080
And you know how she feels
about me. And Lisa?

35:49.180 --> 35:53.117
Well, pfft. Huh. Shoulda heard Lisa
telling everybody at the diner today...

35:53.217 --> 35:55.353
...all about your little fishing trip.

35:55.453 --> 36:00.638
Oh, yeah, all she could talk about
was the size of that trout.

36:06.464 --> 36:18.535
Jack, l guess l just wish you'd felt
that you could have told me.

36:18.976 --> 36:22.935
You know what?
Just forget it.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.447
Thanks for the drink.

36:25.550 --> 36:31.079
l'm happy for you, Jack.
l really am.

Working late?

36:43.601 --> 36:46.297
Yeah. Well, the website.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.172
When l told you about those
corporate trail rides,

36:48.272 --> 36:49.340
l wasn't kidding.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.466

And l was just, l was wondering...

36:58.049 --> 37:00.418
...if maybe he could
come by and take a look.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.518
Of course. Why not?

37:03.287 --> 37:05.356
l don't know, l just thought,
after last time, maybe...

37:05.456 --> 37:06.757
Look, Amy, it's fine.

37:06.857 --> 37:10.461
l... He brought you a horse,
you worked on it,

37:10.561 --> 37:12.964
now you gotta show him
how it's coming along.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.267
Just don't expect me to stick around
and pretend l give a damn...

37:16.367 --> 37:22.431
...if it's cowey or horsey
or sneezy or dopey.

More cows?

Dad's coming over at noon,
to look at his horse.

No, it's fine, Amy.

the cutter slump down already.

enough with you, is it?

myself up out of the dirt...

40:01.766 --> 40:03.501
...and get back on just to make you happy?

40:03.601 --> 40:06.003
And now look at you. You're gonna
do the same thing to Amy.

After everything that happened to you.

What do you mean? My accident?

40:09.707 --> 40:12.597
Why do you think l stopped riding?

40:15.846 --> 40:18.916
Lou, that was just one of those things.

Well, not to me, it wasn't.

You fall off, you get hurt.

the tire off.
