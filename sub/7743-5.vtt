00:09.051 --> 00:10.927
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:11.929 --> 00:13.971
lf you need my help, l'll be around.

00:14.056 --> 00:17.100
No, not this shit. We've been waiting
an hour. My daughter's got asthma.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.227
l'm sorry, this man has chest pains.
He goes first.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.938
Akalitus named Dr. O'Hara chief of the ER.

00:22.022 --> 00:27.068
Nothing has been set in stone. lf you
want chief so badly, show me what you got.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.236
Like a dance-off?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.656
-You have a bunion.
-No, l don't.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.324
Those statues belong here.

00:33.409 --> 00:34.659
Not according to the books.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.327
Can you at least give me
a couple of extra weeks

00:36.412 --> 00:38.246
so that my staff can say their goodbyes?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.831
l brought pie for dessert.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.666
You're cute.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.751
Are they still out there, Eddie and Tunie?

00:43.836 --> 00:46.170
Yeah, l don't think he wants to leave yet.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.422
Really?

01:52.780 --> 01:53.946
Guess who's back.

01:54.031 --> 01:58.951
Okay, l'll tell you. Cantasha,
also known as Candace and Natasha.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.369
Are we talking about ice skaters?

02:00.454 --> 02:03.247
They sat in admitting
and yelled at us all day last time.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.542
The kid ate three bags of nacho chips
and a can of Mountain Dew, totally littered.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.585
So nobody's sick.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.338
Nobody's ever sick. They're always here
and they're never sick. Meanwhile...

02:10.422 --> 02:11.923
Do you have business in the pharmacy?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.299
l do not.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.805
Hey.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.389
Why are you texting Tunie?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.099
She texted me first.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.976
This is my sister-in-law, Eddie.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.274
What are you doing?

02:30.359 --> 02:33.736
l'm trying to see
if you have a leg to stand on.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.323
Yeah, well, whatever. lt doesn't matter.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.658
-No?
-No.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.993
You know what? Forget it. Go for it.

02:41.787 --> 02:45.623
But just so you know, she was up half the
night hacking into her ex-boyfriend's e-mail,

02:45.707 --> 02:47.834
who is a pilot, by the way.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.628
And you're telling me this why?

02:50.712 --> 02:53.548
'Cause l don't wanna see you get sucked in.

02:53.757 --> 02:58.219
Okay.
Coming across a little sharp, all l'm saying.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.055
Well, that's not what l was going for.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.392
You want a little Valium,
help take the edge off?

03:05.811 --> 03:08.521
There is no edge, Eddie, okay?
There's no edge.

03:16.071 --> 03:20.366
Dr. Litmen, please call 513.
Dr. Litmen, please call 513.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.368
-Oh, my God.
-Not now, Thor.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.744
You are gonna die.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.956
Yes, one day for sure. Eventually, yes.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.752
Thirty-five-year-old male,
gunshot wound to the head.

03:31.837 --> 03:35.381
Found unresponsive in Tompkins Square.
Hypotensive, 50 palp in the field.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.592
Guy was caught in the crossfire.
Bystander called it in.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.010
-ls there an exit wound?
-lt's still in there.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.803
-Any good news?
-lt's nice out.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.431
-Shit, he's herniating. Jackie!
-Where's Jackie?

04:17.966 --> 04:19.300
What the...

04:24.598 --> 04:25.765
Jesus.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.518
You fucking rats.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.422
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.007
Fuck.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.096
Time of death 1 1 :1 5 a.m.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.894
l'm really glad you were here.

05:12.688 --> 05:13.854
What for?

05:13.939 --> 05:18.067
You know, two doctors instead of one.
lf it were me, l mean...

05:20.862 --> 05:23.447
We're both really good at what we do.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.411
And it's not like you lost him or l lost him.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.664
We both lost him.
lt's kind of a wash, don't you think?

05:31.748 --> 05:32.832
ls this about being chief?

05:32.916 --> 05:36.293
Look, l respect you as a doctor,
but l also respect you as a competitor.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.797
One of the many differences
between you and l, Dr. Cooper,

05:39.881 --> 05:43.718
is that you keep score on things
that never should be scored.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.970
You're gonna need those coping skills
when you're my subordinate.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.931
Surely any woman that's ever been
under you has needed coping skills.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.018
Sticks and stones. Gotta bounce.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.938
l'm having brunch with my moms
at the Boathouse, Central Park.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.398
How romantic.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.735
Cottage cheese pancakes. That's right.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.572
-Should l ask?
-Not unless you want an answer.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.407
l'll get him ready for the morgue.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.326
Unless you can go back in time
and set his affairs in order, then l doubt...

06:09.411 --> 06:10.828
Yes, l know.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.330
Go get a cup of coffee. Let me clean him up.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.930
Bless your heart.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.559
We were here last week.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.270
My daughter can barely breathe
and you got us waiting here for two hours.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.438
She's got asthma.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.858
Like l said, we can't treat your daughter
until you fill out the necessary...

06:40.942 --> 06:45.029
Like l said, you already got
all my information in your fucking computer.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.198
Ask lndia Arie over there. He knows me.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.949
Can you just follow the rules, please?

06:49.326 --> 06:50.951
ls he even awake?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.162
He has his own vibe.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.249
Candace, to what do we owe the pleasure?

06:58.001 --> 07:02.046
Asthma, same as before.
Natasha can't breathe and these two...

07:02.130 --> 07:03.130
Here we go.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.049
Hello, she can't breathe.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.802
All right, we will get to you
when we get to you. And we will get to you.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.387
Meantime, people are trying to die in here.
Have a seat.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.899
l've seen her at almost every hospital
when l was temping.

07:21.983 --> 07:25.361
Oh, my God, the paperwork? lnsane.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.365
Yeah, well, the more hospital visits
they make, the more assistance they get.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.159
lt's pretty simple. So just move them along.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.794
Have you ever stolen anything?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.045
Yes, many times.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.464
Good. Chapel, half hour. Bring Thor.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.549
You got it.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.104
How's the pain?

08:00.188 --> 08:01.147
Not too bad.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.357
Aren't you a terrible liar?

08:04.234 --> 08:06.902
l still think
it's remarkable that you took a taxi.

08:07.028 --> 08:11.157
Last time they called an ambulance.
That's a lot of attention. More than l want.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.368
Are you sure you're not English?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.579
l'm not sure of a damn thing.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.375
Lou, what a nice surprise.
Nice for me, l mean. Probably not for you.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.335
You took a spill, huh?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.463
Remembering people's names
is my bread and butter,

08:26.548 --> 08:29.717
but for the life of me l cannot remember
your name right now. Forgive me?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.218
No worries. You're a busy man. Jackie.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.554
Jackie! Lou, Lou Babiak. Good to see you.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.973
Mr. Babiak's hypertension
caused him to fall again,

08:36.057 --> 08:40.227
and he now has a broken wrist
and a chipped tooth to show for it.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.773
What happened with the meds,
if you don't mind me asking?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.237
lf you'll excuse me.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.704
l lost my insurance. COBRA ran out.
Couldn't swing it.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.290
Me and everybody else, right?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.417
Well, you're not the only one,
if that's what you mean.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.962
Still, it's humiliating. l lost everything.
My job, insurance.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.506
Twenty years,
l never missed a child support payment.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.009
-They're gonna think l'm a failure.
-Who?

09:13.595 --> 09:14.845
My kids.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.723
First of all,
nothing could be further from the truth.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.559
Second of all, our kids love us blindly.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.561
Believe me, l am counting on it.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.358
All right, why don't you get dressed?
We'll get you discharged.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.363
Right, one filled out prescription.

09:33.657 --> 09:37.284
So no excuses.
Come and see me in a year when it runs out.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.038
l don't know what to say.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.290
Say nothing. l just broke the law.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.804
A year's worth of meds?

09:56.888 --> 10:00.599
l took a leaf out of your book. Sue me.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.559
lmitation is the sincerest form...

10:02.644 --> 10:04.812
And l can't very well flatter your wardrobe.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.815
-l like my scrubs.
-Nope, sorry, can't do it.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.490
Akalitus wants us to meet her in the chapel.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.411
Very well.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.496
Very well?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.716
Cuts both ways, doesn't it?

10:34.509 --> 10:35.843
Are you mad at me?

10:36.344 --> 10:39.763
This morning by the elevators,
totally dismissive.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.351
You talked to me like l was Zoey.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.186
Jesus.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.688
And the hits just keep coming.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.028
l'm sorry, honey.
l didn't mean to be dismissive.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.612
l just have a lot going on at home.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.990
That's another thing.
You didn't even tell me you were married.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.325
You didn't even tell me you were diabetic.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.993
l had to find out in the middle of a trauma.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.077
That's a disease.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.620
My point is it was personal

11:03.705 --> 11:08.417
and l just figured you didn't wanna
discuss it in this little shop of horrors.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.211
Are you trying to placate me
with a musical theater reference?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.213
l am.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.841
-lt's working.
-Good. Let's go in.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.386
Before we go in,
l just wanna make sure that you understand

11:19.471 --> 11:20.596
why my feelings were hurt.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.722
Oh, my God. Let's go.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.146
What's with the hardware?

11:29.230 --> 11:31.357
The diocese is deconsecrating this chapel.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.524
What does that mean?

11:32.609 --> 11:33.984
They're taking my statues.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.694
-Where?
-Staten lsland.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.029
Yikes.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.532
Of all the statues in here,
this is the one that matters the most to me.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.994
She's tall. She's got a lot on her mind.
And l relate.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.790
Also, she's not judgmental.
That's something l'm working on.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.417
lt's irrational, but that's the nature of faith.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.878
We're stealing her.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.422
Sorry to make you an accessory.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.257
Happy to be one.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.387
You were never here. But since you are,
strap Mary to the dolly and follow me.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.766
Okay, okay, okay, this is the last one,
promise.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.559
Big smiles.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.730
-Nope, too dark. One more.
-Dear God.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.107
l wish there was better light in here.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.025
Will you hurry up, Fitch?
My quiche is getting cold.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.319
Just let the boy take a picture, Maureen.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.613
He's taken a thousand since we got here.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.032
That boot is God-awful.
Can't you take that off?

12:22.117 --> 12:25.285
-He has troubled feet.
-Well, he doesn't get that from me.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.830
Another Bloody Mary, please.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.790
-Will you stop?
-Big smiles.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.127
l'll tickle you. Perfect.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.129
Gosh, l love this place.

12:36.339 --> 12:40.676
And l love these pancakes.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.888
All right, honey, that's good.
Put your phone down and eat. Got it?

12:44.973 --> 12:48.475
-Yeah.
-Great. You got it. Here we go.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.062
So when do you become chief?

12:52.147 --> 12:54.064
Well, it's not official,
but l'm feeling pretty good about it.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.858
Why would they give it to you
over a surgeon?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.067
Maureen.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.028
Well, l just want him to be realistic
about the way things are.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.449
-She's a surgeon. He's just a doctor.
-lt's about leadership, Mom.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.741
Well, of course it is.

13:04.826 --> 13:10.664
Well, if you don't get it, don't just up and
quit like you did with soccer and jazz band.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.916
-Can we tell him now?
-No.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.127
Tell me what?

13:15.545 --> 13:16.879
Fitch, we have something to tell you.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.881
Yeah, after our lovely brunch together.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.966
-No, no, now.
-What is it?

13:21.301 --> 13:25.012
We have news we don't want you
to get all dramatic about.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.389
-Deal?
-Deal. What's the news?

13:28.725 --> 13:31.268
-Why did you have to do it like that?
-No, l didn't do it like that.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.520
-Would you be kind for five minutes?
-l did what you said...

13:33.605 --> 13:35.606
You guys are so cute. What is it?

13:35.690 --> 13:36.940
Honey...

13:39.777 --> 13:42.529
Your mother and l are getting a divorce.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.669
And there goes the chin.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.633
What's so great about pilots?

14:02.717 --> 14:06.887
l mean, unless you work for NASA,
you're just a bus driver in the sky.

14:06.971 --> 14:10.557
Yeah. This'll only take a minute.
All the way in the back.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.143
Tunie, let me call you back.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.063
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.024
Okay? All right, we'll make a plan.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.860
How long have you had a cot in here?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.488
Never mind. l don't wanna know.
Take good care of her.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.492
l thought it was just storage back here.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.160
lt is. lt's where l store my cot.

14:31.246 --> 14:35.165
Listen, she called me, all right?
She's out at the airport. She's bored and l...

14:35.250 --> 14:36.583
Sucked in.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.883
He's handling this better than l thought.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.262
Fitch, honey, come on back so we can talk.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.932
You wanna talk? Fine. This is bullshit!

14:52.934 --> 14:56.562
lf he's just going to sit in that little boat
and curse, l'm getting a cab.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.272
Don't you move.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.277
Honey, we're okay, really.

15:03.778 --> 15:07.781
We're always gonna be your mothers.
lt's just time for a change.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.284
You're leaving mom for Dina, aren't you?

15:10.368 --> 15:13.579
Dina is my business partner, Fitch.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.747
Besides, she's straight.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.458
You were straight, too, once, remember?

15:19.586 --> 15:22.713
Honey, your mother and l
love each other very much.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.632
We just can't bear to be
in the same room together anymore.

15:27.885 --> 15:32.806
Dina. Dina! How ridiculous!

15:36.978 --> 15:38.729
How straight is she?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.741
Lou, you all right?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.869
You know, you were discharged.
Do you need somebody to walk you out?

15:53.953 --> 15:58.373
No, l left, but l went home
and then l came back again.

15:58.958 --> 16:03.795
l keep falling.
Not literally, but well, that, too, but...

16:06.215 --> 16:08.925
l feel like l'm gonna do something stupid.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.093
Okay.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.014
l didn't know where else to go.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.683
Okay, you're all right. Come with me.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.048
How long is the wait for a psych eval
and a bed?

16:48.132 --> 16:51.301
-What time's his appointment for?
-l just brought him up. He doesn't have one.

16:51.386 --> 16:55.055
Then he needs to make one, and l don't
have anything until next Thursday, so...

16:56.349 --> 16:57.641
Okay,
we both know you can make this happen.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.643
What is the equivalent
of chest pains up here?

17:00.561 --> 17:03.021
Got it. You're hot shit in the ER?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.273
Well, you don't have
that kind of pull up here, sweetie.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.151
ln order to be seen today, he needs
to make a scheduled appointment

17:08.236 --> 17:09.444
and have a doctor's referral.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.577
l will give you one of my banked
vacation days. lt's yours.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.079
l have 1 1 from last year.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.790
-Got kids?
-Yeah.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.626
l will come over and personally
give everyone their flu shots.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.212
And l'll get you some Zofran
just in case they get nauseous.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.049
Please help me. This guy's
about to stick his head in an oven.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.387
-You'll give one to my mother, too?
-Absolutely.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.142
-Sir, can you step up here, please?
-His name is Lou.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.855
Hi, Lou.
We're gonna take good care of you, okay?

17:44.939 --> 17:47.691
l just need you to fill this form out for me.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.153
Can you manage without your glasses
for a bit? l just wanna freshen up the tape.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.573
Thank you.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.910
-Still need a referring doctor.
-O'Hara.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.093
All right, okay, breathe in one more time.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.639
-Everything good?
-Splendid.

18:20.141 --> 18:23.143
Natasha appears to be in tip-top condition.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.353
She's got asthma. lt's chronic.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.941
Didn't hear any wheezing,
but let's rule it out absolutely.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.902
All right, my dear, you know the drill.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.820
Take a deep breath
and you blow as hard as you can.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.822
Don't push yourself, baby.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.246
The candles on your next birthday cake
don't stand a chance.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.916
She can breathe out. She can't breathe in.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.375
Dr. O'Hara?

18:48.836 --> 18:49.961
lf you'll excuse us.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.637
Everyone's entitled to decent health care.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.222
lf you come in sick, l will fix you.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.641
lf you pretend to be sick,
l am gonna pretend to fix you.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.019
Recent history notwithstanding,
l do know when l'm being swindled.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.354
All right, let it out.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.190
-You better hope l never do.
-Well, you're probably right.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.400
Anyway, l just think you're encouraging
that little girl when...

19:12.485 --> 19:16.488
And, oh, God, l hope l am. And please
stop thinking you're one step ahead.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.742
Tasha, hurry up and get dressed.

19:20.827 --> 19:26.164
So... You've been to lots of hospitals
looks like.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.042
-Yeah.
-Pretty boring, l imagine.

19:29.544 --> 19:32.671
Waiting rooms are miserable places.
l really appreciate your patience.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.467
Much more interesting
on this side of things.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.845
Did ever think about becoming a doctor?

19:41.305 --> 19:43.223
Bet you'd be wonderful.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.978
Well, there she goes again.

19:48.062 --> 19:51.398
She's always trying to get the smart ones
to become doctors.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.609
The smartest people l know are the nurses.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.280
You should become a nurse.
lt's much cooler.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.415
Hey, Thor, have you ever...

20:10.835 --> 20:12.168
With a woman?

20:12.253 --> 20:14.462
Private. What's on the menu?

20:15.089 --> 20:16.339
Private!

20:17.508 --> 20:18.633
Salad wrap.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.428
l'd have told him when l was ready.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.222
l love it when l'm not jealous
of other people's food.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.893
Bon appétit á moi.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.313
A dead rat.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.254
You messed with my stash.

21:13.022 --> 21:16.232
lf you wanna ruin your kids' lives,
get a divorce.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.903
You all right?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.656
l needed that.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.038
You know what l'm gonna do now?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.375
l'm gonna go heal some shit.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.637
Okay, honey. Let me talk to Fiona.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.598
Hi, sweetie.

22:30.725 --> 22:34.310
l just wanted to make sure you guys
got home from school okay.

22:34.729 --> 22:36.688
Yeah? Was it a good day?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.565
You did?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.779
Yeah, l can't wait to see it.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.908
Okay. l love you, too. Bye-bye.

22:51.162 --> 22:56.082
What a lovely, lovely surprise.
Well, not exactly a surprise.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.752
l only have a second.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.628
How much you got?

23:02.214 --> 23:03.423
Two hundred bucks.

23:04.842 --> 23:08.845
You're gonna stand, give me a hug,
slip it in my pocket and sit.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.954
Thirty days clean and sober.
Not me, a client of mine.

23:35.623 --> 23:39.000
l was gonna give it to her at a meeting,
but she didn't make it.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.045
Maybe next time.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.963
Nope. She's dead.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.968
lt's yours.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.308
Lift the bottom.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.570
l'm rooting for you.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.325
Would you like to see a menu?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.619
No, thanks. l'm on the clock.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.086
Peyton? Jackie Peyton.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.682
Thanks.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.733
Hey, would you give these
to the patient in there? Thanks.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.009
Rats.
