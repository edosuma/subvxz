(tranquil music playing)

00:53.867 --> 00:54.633
Yep.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.000
Ahh...

01:00.000 --> 01:02.166
Ahh... uh-huh. Yeah.

01:02.233 --> 01:03.000
Well?

01:03.066 --> 01:05.233
Your infestation profile
is threefold.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.433
You have silverfish
and water bugs in drainage areas

01:08.500 --> 01:11.367
and "blattaria andropolos"
under your baseboard.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.667
Did you hear that, Rose?

01:12.734 --> 01:16.233
The president of Greece
lives under our baseboard.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.767
<i>Blattaria andropolos</i>
is a cockroach.

01:18.834 --> 01:22.233
Maybe he'll be voted out next election.

01:22.767 --> 01:24.467
What can we do about them?

01:24.533 --> 01:26.367
The next step is to ascertain

01:26.433 --> 01:28.567
the condition of your exterior.

01:28.633 --> 01:31.200
I'll perform a cursory inspection

01:31.266 --> 01:32.834
of your subterraneal
substructure.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.367
Crawl under the house?

01:34.433 --> 01:36.266
Anybody can make it
sound stupid.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.266
Poor man. How does he
face himself every day

01:41.333 --> 01:43.967
knowing his life is devoted to
killing other living things?

01:44.033 --> 01:46.867
Rose, I don't think a guy
who drives around

01:46.934 --> 01:49.533
with a fiberglass termite
on the roof of his van

01:49.600 --> 01:51.433
ponders many deep questions.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.266
Oh!

01:54.333 --> 01:55.600
Blanche, what's the matter?

01:55.667 --> 01:59.367
I'm in ecstasy. My body's
tingling all over.

01:59.433 --> 02:00.934
You'll never guess
what happened.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.467
We know what happened.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.333
Let's guess what part
of the Middle East he's from.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.734
I just won the raffle
at the movie theater.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.834
Tickets to the world premiere
of Burt Reynolds' movie.

02:14.767 --> 02:15.567
That's nice.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.266
And passes for me
and my two best friends

02:19.333 --> 02:21.400
to the private party
afterwards

02:21.467 --> 02:26.233
hosted by none other than
Mr. Burt Reynolds himself.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.633
(all scream)

02:28.700 --> 02:30.767
Ohh!

02:30.834 --> 02:32.767
-Yay!
-Ooh!

02:32.834 --> 02:34.700
-Ooh!
-Yay!

02:34.767 --> 02:36.700
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

02:36.767 --> 02:39.033
Ooh!

02:40.266 --> 02:41.467
Sophia, honey--

02:41.533 --> 02:43.834
Oh, no. Not this time.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.133
I'm tired of being the tonto
of the group.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.734
I tried getting another ticket.
I couldn't.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.133
This time, we'll draw cards.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.567
I missed <i>Evita.</i>

02:52.633 --> 02:56.300
I'm not passing up a chance
to meet Burt Reynolds.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.333
Me neither.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.000
<i>Et tu, Blanche?</i>

02:59.066 --> 03:01.633
Sophia, Mr. Burt Reynolds

03:01.700 --> 03:04.033
is one of our finest living actors.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.200
He should've won the Oscar
for <i>Deliverance,</i>

03:06.266 --> 03:08.300
not to mention <i>Starting Over.</i>

03:08.367 --> 03:10.033
That Academy's just jealous.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.100
Put Mr. Sir Laurence Olivier

03:12.166 --> 03:14.400
in "Cannonball Run",
see what he can do.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.967
I'm sorry, Sophia.
The answer's no.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.333
Fine, break an old lady's heart.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.834
I'll be out back with
the other garbage.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.333
Don't worry. She'll get over it.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.333
If she doesn't, who cares?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.834
We're meeting Burt Reynolds!

03:31.900 --> 03:34.266
(all screaming)

03:37.567 --> 03:40.700
I always get this reaction
when I wear the tight jumpsuit.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.533
What did you find
under the house?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.033
Bad news. You got termites.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.934
Termites?
Can you get rid of them?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.734
Haven't you heard our motto?

03:49.800 --> 03:50.600
What is it?

03:50.667 --> 03:52.533
"We get rid of termites."

03:52.600 --> 03:55.300
We'll tent the house
immediately.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.834
You'll have to move out.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.300
Where will we stay?

03:58.367 --> 04:01.800
How about a beautiful hotel
over on Miami Beach?

04:01.867 --> 04:05.734
We're meeting Burt Reynolds.
Let's make it a big weekend.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.900
We can't afford beach hotels.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.567
I'll find something affordable.

04:09.633 --> 04:10.800
What do you say?

04:10.867 --> 04:12.633
It's a terrific idea.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.900
Oh, okay.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.266
Okay, you can
start tomorrow.

04:17.533 --> 04:21.533
I'm off to find the perfect hotel
for our weekend.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.100
Ma, a beach hotel.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.533
Doesn't that sound like fun?

04:25.600 --> 04:26.667
I get to go?

04:26.734 --> 04:29.066
I'm not getting gassed with the termites?

04:30.567 --> 04:33.500
Oh, Dorothy, you're
such a good daughter.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.200
She'll get over it.

04:35.266 --> 04:36.667
And if she doesn't, who cares?

04:36.734 --> 04:39.800
We're going to meet Burt Reynolds!

04:39.867 --> 04:43.367
-Ohh!
-Ha, ha!

04:47.533 --> 04:50.667
You want the bed facing the TV
or the one next to the window?

04:50.734 --> 04:52.967
I want the bed next to Burt Reynolds.

04:53.934 --> 04:56.600
Fine, I'll take this one.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.066
(coughs)

04:58.133 --> 04:59.300
Ma, you all right?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.800
Yeah. Just a little relapse

05:01.867 --> 05:03.967
from the pneumonia I caught.

05:04.033 --> 05:07.100
You remember. I ran 6 miles
in the rain and the cold

05:07.166 --> 05:10.166
to bring you the cannoli
you forgot to put in your lunchbox.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.533
Ma, please.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.700
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

05:14.767 --> 05:17.567
You all go schmooze with Burt
and his Hollywood buddies.

05:17.633 --> 05:20.033
I'll stay here and hack myself
unconscious.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.900
That's being a good sport.

05:25.734 --> 05:28.433
Dorothy, you think Burt's
gonna like this dress?

05:28.500 --> 05:33.500
Oh, yeah. That plunging neckline
will show off his chest hair.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.166
The last time I wore this dress

05:36.233 --> 05:39.133
was at the 1972
Presidential Inauguration.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.133
I ended the evening dancing
in the arms of the president.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.767
The next morning,
I woke up still in his arms.

05:44.834 --> 05:48.600
Blanche, you and Nixon?

05:48.667 --> 05:52.533
Nixon? Yuck. No.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.967
I can't even picture Nixon naked.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.734
I think he looks like
one of those dress-up dolls.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.600
Little mounds of plastic to indicate
where everything ought to be.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.633
No, I was talking about
Mr. William Buster Collier,

06:08.700 --> 06:10.800
the president of
the Chamber of Commerce.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.633
Oh, that Presidential Inauguration.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.667
Buster wanted me to be
his first lady,

06:15.734 --> 06:19.233
-but he died 2 days later.
-I'm sorry.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.900
He was performing
his first official function...

06:21.967 --> 06:24.900
breaking a bottle of champagne
over the city's new toll booth,

06:24.967 --> 06:27.600
but before he could
step out of the way,

06:27.667 --> 06:31.266
he was run over
by 10 shriners on minibikes

06:31.333 --> 06:34.500
who just happened to have
the exact change.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.767
So many of our great leaders
have gone that way.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.667
-There's a story about the party.
-Really?

06:42.734 --> 06:46.066
Look who'll be there.
Dom DeLuise.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.433
-Wow!
-Wow!

06:47.500 --> 06:48.700
Loni Anderson.

06:48.767 --> 06:49.934
-Wow!
-Wow!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.033
Charles Nelson Reilly.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.433
Charles Nelson Reilly.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.567
Wow. Who else?

07:00.633 --> 07:03.433
-John Forsythe.
-Mr. John Forsythe!

07:03.500 --> 07:06.934
Oh, my God.
He's the sexiest man in television.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.033
Burt is the sexiest man in movies.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.200
I cannot believe this.
All that manliness in one room,

07:12.266 --> 07:13.500
one crowded room.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.033
(Blanche) One hot, crowded room.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.333
Everybody's steamy bodies pressed--

07:17.400 --> 07:21.600
Blanche, relax. You're about to set off
the smoke detector.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.166
(telephone rings)

07:24.233 --> 07:25.500
Hello?

07:25.567 --> 07:26.700
This is Rose Nylund.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.533
What?

07:30.467 --> 07:33.934
I'm one of the winners
of the publishers' clearinghouse?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.100
Ed McMahon wants to see me
right away?

07:39.233 --> 07:43.433
I should leave my Burt Reynolds ticket
on the dresser before I go?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.767
Ma, get off the phone!

07:47.800 --> 07:49.567
(Sophia) Mind your own business!

07:52.166 --> 07:55.166
Guess what. I think this is Sophia.

08:07.467 --> 08:09.033
Which room's available?

08:10.033 --> 08:12.066
506.

08:12.133 --> 08:14.800
The room's 50, and the young lady's 100.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.066
Make it quick.
I'm not running a hotel here.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.500
Don't you love our hotel?

08:29.567 --> 08:32.000
It's nicer than those big chains.

08:32.066 --> 08:33.400
How did you find it?

08:33.467 --> 08:36.033
It was affordable, near the beach,

08:36.100 --> 08:39.100
and it had the most men.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.000
Let's not keep Burt waiting.

08:42.066 --> 08:45.500
Wait a minute.
Let's have a quick drink in the bar.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.834
-Blanche.
-Come on.

08:47.900 --> 08:48.900
Come on. It'll be fun.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.533
Let's make it quick.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.800
Miss? (snaps finger)

08:54.400 --> 08:57.467
Girls, see that man over there
staring at me?

08:58.934 --> 09:01.700
He's undressing me
with his eyes.

09:01.767 --> 09:03.333
Should we move?

09:03.400 --> 09:06.133
Not yet. He's only half done.

09:07.467 --> 09:10.066
Excuse me. I couldn't help
but notice you

09:10.133 --> 09:11.066
from across the room.

09:11.767 --> 09:16.166
We'd like to buy
you ladies a drink.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.200
We really don't have much time.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.967
This is Carl, and this is John.

09:21.033 --> 09:22.300
We're from Kenosha.

09:22.367 --> 09:25.367
I know a John from Kenosha.

09:25.433 --> 09:28.734
I'll bet you know a lot of Johns.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.200
(laughing)

09:30.266 --> 09:31.400
That's a good one.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.500
It must be regional humor.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.400
We're here for the clothing convention.

09:35.467 --> 09:38.166
Tell me,
is leather big this year?

09:38.233 --> 09:39.734
It is with Carl.

09:39.800 --> 09:44.266
Yeah, as long as I don't
have to pay extra.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.367
Even I don't get that one.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.166
So, what's your name?

09:53.233 --> 09:56.333
Blanche. These are my friends
Rose and Dorothy.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.266
How long have you girls been working?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.133
That's an odd lead-off question, Carl.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.066
But actually,
I've been working about 30 years.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.100
You must really know your business.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.734
Dorothy's a very experienced
teacher.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.233
Everyone who's had her
says she's great.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.600
Let's go upstairs

10:19.667 --> 10:22.133
and have Dorothy teach us the three Rs--

10:22.200 --> 10:24.633
reading, writing,
and running around the bed.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.800
As enticing as the offer is, we'll pass.

10:28.867 --> 10:32.400
<i>Scusamente.</i>
If you don't want to party,

10:32.467 --> 10:35.567
there are younger girls
who'll take our money.

10:37.133 --> 10:40.500
Girls who'll take their money.
Do you know what he thinks we are?

10:40.567 --> 10:41.834
Waitresses?

10:43.734 --> 10:45.967
No, Rose. Hookers!

10:46.033 --> 10:48.433
God. That must mean everybody here is--

10:48.500 --> 10:51.066
Everybody here is under arrest.
This is a raid.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.233
(gasps)

11:06.834 --> 11:09.767
All right, stay where you are.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.400
The wagons will be here momentarily

11:11.467 --> 11:14.100
to transport you all downtown.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.867
Downtown? He means jail!

11:16.934 --> 11:19.867
Really, Rose?
I thought he meant Neiman-Marcus.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.233
I've never been in jail.
I won't make it.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.967
They always prey on
the weak and innocent.

11:27.033 --> 11:28.233
The others will taunt me

11:28.300 --> 11:30.800
for trying to excel
at my work in the laundry.

11:32.834 --> 11:37.033
I'll join a crowd whose leader
looks like Ethel Merman.

11:37.100 --> 11:41.433
I'll be forced to engineer a prison break
using my laundry cart.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.767
I won't know a moment's peace.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.000
I'll scar my fingerprints with acid.

11:47.066 --> 11:48.834
I'll run from town to town,

11:48.900 --> 11:52.166
taking jobs that people have
who got bad grades.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.233
Then they'll find me,

11:55.300 --> 11:58.900
holed up in a shack
in the Louisiana bayou.

11:58.967 --> 12:02.467
A sheriff named Bull will call my name.

12:02.533 --> 12:05.367
When I run for it,
he'll riddle my body with bullets.

12:05.433 --> 12:10.834
Please don't let them take me downtown.
I want to live!

12:11.834 --> 12:14.133
You're not very good in a crisis, are you?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.233
Dorothy, what are we going to do?

12:17.300 --> 12:21.467
We'll simply explain
that this is a terrible mistake.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.567
Officer.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.066
What can I do for the senior
statesman of the group?

12:27.133 --> 12:28.667
(laughing)

12:29.767 --> 12:32.867
I'll let that pass because
you have the upper hand.

12:32.934 --> 12:35.867
My friends and I are totally innocent.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.333
-I'm innocent.
-Me, too.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.166
We're all innocent.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.967
Quiet, you trash.

12:42.834 --> 12:43.867
Go on, Dorothy.

12:43.934 --> 12:47.467
Officer, if I could see you
for just a moment,

12:47.533 --> 12:50.834
I'm sure we could settle this matter
to your satisfaction.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.200
Forget it. I'm married.

12:53.266 --> 12:55.967
All of you downtown.
We're moving now.

12:56.033 --> 12:58.066
You don't understand.

12:58.133 --> 13:00.400
We were going to see
Mr. Burt Reynolds.

13:00.467 --> 13:04.266
Don't you dare drag
Burt's good name into this.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.400
Move, all of you. Let's go.

13:07.467 --> 13:11.100
Come on. Move along. Move along.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.033
I cannot believe it. Arrested.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.133
I've never been in jail in my entire life.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.567
Relax, honey.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.967
With that many notches
on your garter belt,

13:25.033 --> 13:26.667
it was bound to happen.

13:27.667 --> 13:28.533
(scoffs)

13:30.767 --> 13:35.200
-Oh, Rose, honey. Are you all right?
-I was booked.

13:35.834 --> 13:39.033
Fingerprints, mug shots.
I'm a known criminal.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.367
I'll never be able to go back
to my hometown again.

13:41.433 --> 13:44.133
Nobody back home will find out
about this.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.333
Yes, they will.
<i>The St. Olaf Courier-Dispatch</i>

13:47.400 --> 13:49.834
is known for its
investigative reporting.

13:51.066 --> 13:53.834
You're right. That series
they did on oat fungus

13:53.900 --> 13:56.667
was an uncompromising
piece of journalism.

13:56.734 --> 14:00.367
Damn. I bet you Burt is greeting
his guests now.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.667
I can't believe we're going to miss it.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.233
Well, I won't accept it.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.567
Oh, excuse me. Um, officer.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.233
A grievous injustice

14:15.300 --> 14:17.233
has been perpetrated
upon my friends and me.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.433
We're totally innocent.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.433
We're just three helpless females

14:21.500 --> 14:24.266
desperately in need of a big, strong,

14:24.333 --> 14:26.000
strapping man like yourself.

14:30.467 --> 14:32.367
Ooh, what cute earrings.

14:34.567 --> 14:38.633
You thought you could get us out
by flirting with that guard?

14:38.700 --> 14:40.367
If he'd been a man.

14:40.433 --> 14:43.767
It's always a man with you, Blanche.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.200
Men and sex. Sex and men.

14:45.266 --> 14:47.967
There's nothing wrong
with being career-oriented.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.233
It's your overactive sex drive

14:52.300 --> 14:53.367
that got us into this.

14:53.433 --> 14:56.467
Who picks a hotel
because of men in the lobby?

14:59.834 --> 15:02.133
Get off my back.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.834
You think I'm happy
being arrested?

15:03.900 --> 15:06.333
You think I'm happy missing
Burt Reynolds?

15:06.400 --> 15:10.100
You think I'm happy here
with this common gutter trash?

15:10.166 --> 15:11.600
What did you just say?

15:12.834 --> 15:15.500
Oh. What cute earrings.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.700
Nobody calls me names.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.967
Let's go. I'll let you
have the first punch.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.133
Punch? Heavens.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.800
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:25.867 --> 15:28.533
Now wait a minute here.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.867
You cut that out right now.
You'll get us in trouble.

15:30.934 --> 15:32.967
I'm going to tear you apart.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.467
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:35.533 --> 15:37.900
Listen, you punk.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.400
You want to fight with someone,
you'll have to fight with me.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.033
But I warn you,
I did time in Attica.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.333
Attica's a men's prison.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.934
I know. I was there a year
before they found out.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.667
Sorry, chief.

15:55.734 --> 15:58.200
I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.800
Dorothy, that was magnificent.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.934
How did you ever pull that off?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.667
I work in the public school system.
It's not that different.

16:12.166 --> 16:15.934
Blanche, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I apologize.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.800
No, don't you worry about it.
We're all on edge.

16:18.867 --> 16:21.834
This has to be the biggest disappointment
of my life.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.200
Yeah. I've known some
real disappointment, too.

16:25.266 --> 16:29.934
You're not going to tell us about
the exploding pig?

16:30.867 --> 16:34.500
I never told you
about an exploding pig.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.600
It was a peg-legged pig.

16:39.533 --> 16:42.834
Our possum was the one
that exploded.

16:43.834 --> 16:47.300
Forgive me. There've been so many
possum explosions lately,

16:47.367 --> 16:48.767
it's hard to keep track.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.934
So, what was this great disappointment
in your life, Rose?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.967
Butter. I wanted to be Butter Queen.

16:56.033 --> 16:59.400
Oh, yeah. What an actress.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.600
She was so good in
<i>Gone With The Wind.</i>

17:04.633 --> 17:07.667
I wanted to be Miss Olivia de Havilland.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.166
Blanche, are you listening?

17:09.233 --> 17:10.500
Bits and pieces.

17:10.567 --> 17:12.333
Go on, Rose.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.500
Butter Queen was our town's
highest honor.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.533
Since I was born,
my folks groomed me for it.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.900
Singing and dancing lessons,
junior butter pageants.

17:21.967 --> 17:26.667
For 16 years, my entire life
revolved around butter.

17:26.734 --> 17:28.734
You were fortunate.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.867
So many of us
wasted our youth.

17:32.266 --> 17:34.066
When the time came
for the pageant,

17:34.133 --> 17:35.900
I was incredible.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.433
I showed poise
in the evening gown competition,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.900
I was brilliant
in the oral butter quiz.

17:41.967 --> 17:45.433
I got the trick margarine question.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.600
That evening,
butter was spelled R-O-S-E.

17:50.233 --> 17:53.533
Rose, you're embarrassing yourself.
Don't go on.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.033
I have to, Dorothy.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.700
I've kept these bitter butter memories
too long.

17:59.967 --> 18:02.533
As the pageant drew to its
frenzied finale,

18:02.600 --> 18:05.233
there I was alongside
the other two finalists,

18:05.300 --> 18:06.967
churning my guts out,

18:07.033 --> 18:10.467
when all of a sudden,
for no apparent reason,

18:10.533 --> 18:12.033
my churn jammed.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.533
-No!
-No!

18:13.600 --> 18:14.967
Yes!

18:15.033 --> 18:17.967
And just like that, it was over.

18:18.033 --> 18:19.533
I'd lost.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.667
It was the biggest disappointment
in my life.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.133
It was small consolation
to find out years later

18:27.200 --> 18:29.767
there had been
churn-tampering involved.

18:31.033 --> 18:36.166
Blanche and I are going to
the other end of the cell.

18:36.233 --> 18:38.133
Don't cross this line.

18:45.533 --> 18:49.000
Did I hear you say
you were from St. Olaf?

18:49.066 --> 18:50.333
Yes.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.033
I'm from St. Gustaf.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.433
We're neighbors.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.400
My name's Meg.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.834
I'm Rose. What are you
doing here, Meg?

18:58.900 --> 19:02.000
I was arrested for being a hooker,
like you.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.834
I'm not a hooker.
I was arrested by mistake.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.533
I tell the judge that, too.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.367
How did you get mixed up in this?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.367
I don't know.
Things were bad at home.

19:14.433 --> 19:18.467
I ended up in Miami.
It just...happened.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.867
Nothing could be
bad enough at home

19:20.934 --> 19:24.900
for you to end up doing
what you're doing.

19:24.967 --> 19:27.500
I don't need a lecture.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.500
You can't be happy with your life.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.333
I don't want to talk about it.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.300
If you ever do want to,
neighbor to neighbor, I'm here.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.700
Ma, thank God you're here.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.233
Arrested for prostitution.
I can't believe it.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.767
Oh, Sophia.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.033
Sophia, we're innocent.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.400
I know. I can't believe these cops think

19:53.467 --> 19:55.166
anyone would pay money
to sleep with you.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.767
Sophia, did you come to bail us out?

20:02.834 --> 20:06.734
No, she's dropping off a manicotti
with a file in it.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.867
We'll get to see Burt Reynolds after all.

20:09.934 --> 20:12.533
These tickets won't go to waste.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.834
So which of you isn't going?

20:18.133 --> 20:21.166
I'm the one who won the tickets.

20:21.233 --> 20:23.266
My mom's the one who's bailing us out.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.000
I lost butter queen.

20:25.066 --> 20:26.867
Haven't I suffered enough?

20:27.700 --> 20:29.967
-We'll draw straws.
-No.

20:30.033 --> 20:31.567
-We'll flip a coin.
-No.

20:31.633 --> 20:34.000
Sophia, try and be understanding.

20:34.066 --> 20:38.367
Understanding? I'm bailing you out,
and you won't let me go?

20:38.433 --> 20:41.533
Ma, stop complaining
and get us out of here.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.900
Where are your roommates,
Mrs. Petrillo?

20:43.967 --> 20:44.800
They're not here.

20:44.867 --> 20:45.934
Ma!

20:46.000 --> 20:48.834
Don't "ma" me, you cheap floozie.

20:48.900 --> 20:53.567
(gasps) Ma, you would do this
to your own flesh and blood?

20:53.633 --> 20:55.333
You'll get over it, Dorothy.

20:55.400 --> 21:00.200
If you don't, who cares?
I'm on my way to see Burt Reynolds.

21:00.266 --> 21:01.900
(Rose) Come back here.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.166
And then... you'll love this.

21:12.233 --> 21:14.100
Dom DeLuise takes my arm

21:14.166 --> 21:15.967
and insists I tell Burt the story.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.834
Sophia, I don't want to hear it.

21:17.900 --> 21:22.633
Not even when Burt and Dom
insisted I tell Loni Anderson?

21:22.700 --> 21:25.633
That's it.
I don't want to hear another word.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.834
Oh. Cinderella's back from the ball,

21:27.900 --> 21:29.934
and her three wicked roommates
are jealous.

21:33.533 --> 21:36.233
We are not jealous, ma.
We are angry.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.066
You left us sitting in jail.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.700
I sent bail money.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.233
You were out an hour later.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.700
About then,
I was nibbling a giant shrimp

21:44.767 --> 21:46.867
from Jerry Reed's hand.

21:46.934 --> 21:48.934
You're making this whole thing up

21:49.000 --> 21:49.900
just to rub it in.

21:49.967 --> 21:52.133
You have never met these people.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.700
Jealousy is a very ugly thing.

21:56.767 --> 21:59.266
And so are you in anything backless.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.500
(doorbell rings)

22:09.667 --> 22:13.600
Last night was a bigger disappointment
than losing butter queen.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.300
Want to know why?

22:15.367 --> 22:16.367
(both) No.

22:21.033 --> 22:22.633
Meg! Come in.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.800
I can't. My taxi's waiting.

22:24.867 --> 22:28.066
I just wanted to come say thank you.

22:28.133 --> 22:28.967
For what?

22:29.033 --> 22:31.600
For convincing me to go back home.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.900
I'll give it another try.

22:33.967 --> 22:36.100
Oh, that's great.

22:37.166 --> 22:40.000
-What was it I said?
-(Meg) Nothing.

22:40.066 --> 22:44.834
I just don't want to be as old as you
and still be in the business.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.467
Well, good luck.

22:56.367 --> 22:58.467
I've never felt so good...

23:00.066 --> 23:02.600
and so cheap in my whole life.

23:04.967 --> 23:08.033
At least something good
came from that horrible night.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.867
(doorbell rings)

23:16.300 --> 23:17.400
Hello.

23:34.533 --> 23:35.633
Sophia around?

23:35.700 --> 23:37.033
Oh. Hi, Burt!

23:40.600 --> 23:41.700
A little lunch?

23:41.767 --> 23:44.133
If you're buying, a big lunch.

23:44.900 --> 23:48.500
My God, you're Mr. Burt Reynolds.

23:48.567 --> 23:50.967
If not, I'm wearing the wrong underwear.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.533
-These your roommates?
-Yeah.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.233
Which one's the slut?

23:56.300 --> 23:57.600
(all) I am.

24:11.166 --> 24:14.100
(theme music playing)
