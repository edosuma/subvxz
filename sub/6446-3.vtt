35:35.258 --> 35:38.045
Congratulations, you just delivered
a front-page freak story.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.586
I'm just glad you're ﬁnally out
of the frozen-food section.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.005
-Brr!
-Ha-ha-ha.

35:45.435 --> 35:50.179
You know, when we ﬁrst got together,
I thought that you were pretty prejudiced.

35:50.941 --> 35:54.274
Quick to jump to the conclusion
that some meteor-infected murderer...

35:54.444 --> 35:57.311
...was behind every bad thing
that happened in Smallville.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.774
-Jimmy....
-But you're right.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.573
I've seen enough now to know
that sooner or later, they all...

36:05.747 --> 36:07.487
...snap.

36:09.584 --> 36:13.418
So, from now on,
it's open season on the infected.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.874
What do you say we clean up
this town, partner?

36:16.299 --> 36:17.334
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

36:20.095 --> 36:22.882
Sorry, I just came back for my bag.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.065
Why don't we go upstairs?

36:37.070 --> 36:38.606
Okay.

36:48.081 --> 36:51.573
LANA: You have no idea how good it feels
to be back here...

36:51.751 --> 36:54.128
...despite everything
that's happened lately.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.537
CLARK:
"Everything" meaning Kara?

36:56.715 --> 36:59.502
Meeting your cousin
has deﬁnitely been an experience...

36:59.676 --> 37:03.419
...but I was talking more about
what's gone on with us.

37:03.597 --> 37:07.715
Clark, I was afraid that
you wouldn't forgive me for marrying Lex.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.008
Or for leaving.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.058
Lana, nothing can ever change the way
I feel about you.

37:15.901 --> 37:20.235
-l've made so many mistakes--
-We've both made mistakes.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.648
This is our chance to start over.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.328
I just hope you know
what you're getting into.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.666
I know exactly what I'm getting into.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.499
Clark, I came back here for you.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.955
For us.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.840
I never wanna let the past
come between us again.

37:48.350 --> 37:52.844
I want us to wake up every morning
and be there for each other.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.559
I wanna grow old together.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.705
Tell me it's not too late
for a cappuccino.

38:20.548 --> 38:24.382
-Sorry, we're closed.
-Even for the owner?

38:27.222 --> 38:30.931
Technically, I don't even work here yet.
At least, not until tomorrow.

38:31.101 --> 38:34.559
I just came down to pick up the bag
that I left.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.804
I wanna thank you for saving my life.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.024
I know it was you.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.859
At the river?

38:44.114 --> 38:45.979
You have me confused
with someone else.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.899
You ripped the roof off my car.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.570
You must have been through
a terrible ordeal.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.488
You were there.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.582
It's okay.

39:02.424 --> 39:06.713
I won't tell anyone, I promise.
Your secret's safe with me.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.506
I've already protected you.

39:11.391 --> 39:15.555
Like I would have protected others close
to me if they would have told me the truth.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.766
This time I'm hoping to change all that.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.648
I just need you to be honest with me.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.902
Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor...

39:27.073 --> 39:30.941
...but the only secret I've got
is that I make a lousy cappuccino.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.907
It's probably not the best thing
to confess to your boss, huh?

39:35.206 --> 39:38.448
Twice, I've been pulled back
from the brink of death.

39:39.002 --> 39:42.711
And both times it was by a member
of the Kent family.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.298
I'm not a man who believes
in coincidences.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.508
Sooner or later I'll ﬁnd out the truth.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.554
Are you a savior?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.016
Or are you a warning?
