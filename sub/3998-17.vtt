WEBVTT

00:01.406 --> 00:02.773
- Man, this is gonna be fun!
- Ah, come on!

00:02.807 --> 00:04.174
Get it close to the light.

00:04.209 --> 00:05.876
Okay, just because
you invented Sky Knife

00:05.910 --> 00:07.911
doesn't mean you can
tell me how to throw.

00:07.946 --> 00:09.613
Hurry up, man.
You can do this.

00:09.647 --> 00:11.281
One, two, three.

00:11.316 --> 00:12.082
Sky Knife!

00:13.418 --> 00:14.585
Yeah!

00:14.619 --> 00:15.886
What's up?

00:15.920 --> 00:17.020
Oh, hey. What's up?
Nothing, just a...

00:17.055 --> 00:18.122
Hey, uh, straight-up chillin'.

00:18.156 --> 00:20.424
You guys,

00:20.458 --> 00:22.764
it's a really long story,
but I think I saw an eagle.

00:22.944 --> 00:24.828
I was shopping for books on Western...

00:24.863 --> 00:26.163
Oh, my God!

00:26.197 --> 00:27.631
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:27.665 --> 00:29.066
Oh, God, what the hell?

00:29.100 --> 00:30.601
You were in the drop zone.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.336
- Good save, Nick.
- You were a hero!

00:32.369 --> 00:33.504
Good save.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.472
We were playing Sky Knife.
You mad?

00:35.507 --> 00:36.473
No.

00:36.508 --> 00:38.909
No. I... I think it's been
a great game this week.

00:38.943 --> 00:40.811
I'm amazed at how great it is.

00:40.845 --> 00:42.780
Uh! Awesome! I thought you were
gonna be mad. All right.

00:42.814 --> 00:45.582
I'm gonna go get the bad-ass
knives from Schmidt's house.

00:45.617 --> 00:46.950
- Cool.
- Get 'em, girl.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.088
Um, guys, we have a problem.

00:51.122 --> 00:52.456
I know, but Abby's gonna fix it.

00:52.490 --> 00:53.691
She's going to get the cooler knives.

00:53.725 --> 00:55.492
The problem is Abby.

00:55.527 --> 00:57.261
She's been here one week

00:57.295 --> 00:59.930
and has already created chaos
everywhere.

00:59.964 --> 01:02.166
I don't know if anybody noticed,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.767
but she destroyed
my sunflower painting

01:03.802 --> 01:05.969
- with a picture of a penis.
- The iguana's cool.

01:06.004 --> 01:07.604
- I like the iguana.
- Who doesn't love an iguana?

01:07.639 --> 01:09.506
- I like its tail.
- Yeah.

01:11.076 --> 01:12.643
Oh, my God, you guys, it's Terry.

01:12.677 --> 01:14.244
The bastard found me.
He wants his stuff.

01:14.279 --> 01:16.480
Who's Terry?! What's his stuff?!
Cocaine drugs?!

01:16.514 --> 01:17.748
Worse.

01:17.782 --> 01:19.450
You guys got to hide.

01:19.484 --> 01:21.185
Oh, my God, I knew
this was gonna happen.

01:21.219 --> 01:23.587
- Everybody in your earthquake spots now!
- Jess!

01:25.090 --> 01:26.523
She's messing with you.

01:28.927 --> 01:30.361
Yeah, I know.

01:30.395 --> 01:32.696
We are messing with you.

01:32.731 --> 01:34.292
- No.
- I don't think you were involved.

01:34.472 --> 01:35.866
- Don't taunt you, dude.
- You guys were all afraid of Terry.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.302
Us Day sisters up to our old pranks.

01:38.336 --> 01:40.070
- You're not part of it.
- Yes, I am!

01:40.105 --> 01:42.840
- You got messed with.
- You got messed with, not me.

01:42.874 --> 01:44.331
You're doing that voice
when you get messed with.

01:44.351 --> 01:46.337
- No, I'm not.
- You guys, this is so fun.

01:46.347 --> 01:49.179
- I want to live here.
- Ah, ha, ha!

01:49.214 --> 01:51.849
That was funny, 'cause
we're messing with you again.

01:51.883 --> 01:53.650
No. I'm serious.
That one was real.

01:53.685 --> 01:55.185
I think I should live here.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.720
I hate this game.

02:23.748 --> 02:26.383
You looking up how to eat a bagel?

02:26.418 --> 02:29.720
No. I'm, uh, seeing if I passed
the LAPD entrance exam.

02:29.754 --> 02:32.222
Results go up in 30 seconds.

02:32.257 --> 02:34.058
If you pass, you get to be a cop?

02:34.092 --> 02:35.859
No, I get to go to the
police academy, you know?

02:35.894 --> 02:38.395
Hope I get a dog partner.

02:38.430 --> 02:39.930
Yeah.
Oh, you are pretty calm

02:39.964 --> 02:41.532
for someone who's about
to get life-changing news.

02:41.566 --> 02:43.434
You must be really cool
under pressure.

02:43.468 --> 02:45.669
No! I'm a huge choker.

02:45.704 --> 02:47.604
Huge!

02:47.639 --> 02:49.473
Girl, I ain't had a job
in over three months.

02:49.507 --> 02:51.909
So, this is...
that moment, I guess,

02:51.943 --> 02:56.046
when you find out if
you're really a failure or not.

02:56.081 --> 02:58.615
Check it.
Excitement's killing me!

02:58.650 --> 03:01.051
Man, would you look
at the... time?

03:01.086 --> 03:03.587
Man. Girl, I got an obligation

03:03.621 --> 03:07.257
at a sandwich meeting...
to... to go to.

03:10.161 --> 03:13.664
Yes...

03:13.698 --> 03:17.334
Well, you see,
loyalty has a price, Mr. President.

03:17.369 --> 03:18.969
Give me the hot dogs!

03:19.004 --> 03:23.407
Put the damn hot dogs in the bag,
you son of a bitch, and I won't...

03:23.441 --> 03:26.610
Oh, my God. What are we gonna
do? She can't move in to...

03:26.644 --> 03:28.345
Take that off.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.781
- I hope those are clean.
- Enough.

03:30.815 --> 03:32.182
I don't want to be involved

03:32.217 --> 03:33.517
with your weird thing with your sister.

03:33.551 --> 03:36.020
It's not a weird thing with my sister.

03:36.054 --> 03:37.454
She is crazy.

03:37.489 --> 03:39.289
- No.
- She's wanted in Canada.

03:39.324 --> 03:42.793
Canada. No one's wanted
in Canada.

03:42.827 --> 03:45.029
Hey, uh, you guys want to
hang out, like, right now?

03:45.063 --> 03:48.265
Maybe go up to Alhambra, try
on a whole mess of jeans?

03:48.299 --> 03:49.833
Don't you find out about
that cop test today?

03:49.868 --> 03:52.803
Oh, you know... Oh, yeah. No.

03:52.837 --> 03:54.705
Look, man, the Alhambra
thing, though...

03:54.739 --> 03:56.473
it's getting a lot of momentum,
you know?

03:56.508 --> 03:58.175
So I think I'm gonna go ahead
and do that

03:58.209 --> 04:00.511
'cause when you... you know,
when you do that, so...

04:00.545 --> 04:03.947
Okay, I'm gonna guarantee you
that Abby is responsible for that.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.449
Yeah, she got to me.

04:05.483 --> 04:06.873
If you don't want
Abby to live here, Jessica,

04:07.041 --> 04:08.018
why don't you just tell her?

04:08.053 --> 04:09.820
Nick, you can't just

04:09.854 --> 04:11.789
tell Abby to do something,
'cause she'll do the opposite.

04:11.823 --> 04:13.957
So I'm gonna have to go find
a place for her to live

04:13.992 --> 04:15.960
and make her think it's her idea.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.695
She can't find out
what I'm up to.

04:17.728 --> 04:20.363
Do you think you can keep her
busy and lie to her all day?

04:20.398 --> 04:23.233
Jess, I come from a family
of con artists and liars.

04:23.268 --> 04:26.470
And the one thing I learned
is, you can't lie to a liar.

04:26.504 --> 04:28.205
It don't fly.

04:28.239 --> 04:29.673
Yeah, you shouldn't be involved.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.642
No, I shouldn't.

04:31.676 --> 04:33.043
Wait a second.

04:33.078 --> 04:35.546
Are you doing reverse psychology?

04:35.580 --> 04:37.136
Yeah, it is reverse psychology.

04:37.302 --> 04:39.465
That is reverse psychology,
so you just reversed it,

04:39.484 --> 04:42.319
so now it's reverse, reverse,
which is just psychology.

04:42.354 --> 04:44.521
Hmm, which one is it?

04:44.556 --> 04:45.990
You outfoxed me. I'm in.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.858
I'm gonna do it.

04:47.892 --> 04:52.396
So, our time is up, but, um,
I don't have any more clients,

04:52.430 --> 04:53.831
so, uh...
Oh.

04:53.865 --> 04:55.299
You brought it with that less set, ma.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.701
I got to tell you. I mean,
what can't that butt do?

04:57.736 --> 05:00.371
- You shaped it, so you get dibs.
- Mmm.

05:00.405 --> 05:01.538
Dibs.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.843
Can I get dibs? Because
both y'all butts look great.

05:05.877 --> 05:08.112
I mean, I can't tell
who's in first place.

05:08.146 --> 05:10.347
Hey, uh, Coach, you know
how you're always

05:10.382 --> 05:11.882
getting on me about my pizza baby?

05:11.916 --> 05:13.684
- Yeah.
- Well, today is the day

05:13.718 --> 05:15.019
that I get rid of it.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.788
- I am here to train.
- Save it, dude.

05:17.822 --> 05:20.357
You're avoiding your test
results. Nick texted me.

05:20.392 --> 05:22.026
Guess you can't outrun a text.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.261
- Nope.
- Well, with the right amount of training...

05:24.296 --> 05:26.697
All right, listen to me.
Um, I need you to leave.

05:26.731 --> 05:27.631
I'm with a client.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.300
A beautiful one.

05:29.334 --> 05:30.701
I'm trying to, you know...

05:30.735 --> 05:32.436
Mm.

05:32.470 --> 05:34.705
You're trying to whistle.

05:34.739 --> 05:36.507
No, no, no, no, no, I'm
trying to have sex with her.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.709
Oh! Sex.

05:38.743 --> 05:42.146
But I did book you for
the entire afternoon, though.

05:43.948 --> 05:45.082
- Why would you do that?
- But...

05:45.116 --> 05:47.804
if you guys are doing a little thing,
then I could easily just...

05:47.844 --> 05:49.386
- Leave and check your test scores?
- ...do a tandem session.

05:49.421 --> 05:50.754
- Oh, fun.
- Right?

05:50.789 --> 05:52.189
Coach, you should show him

05:52.223 --> 05:53.757
that ground stretch
you did on me earlier.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.460
It was opening me
up really nicely.

05:56.494 --> 05:57.628
Yes, please.

05:57.662 --> 05:59.463
I don't wanna.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.232
Oh.

06:08.306 --> 06:09.273
This is amazing.

06:09.307 --> 06:10.641
Oh!

06:10.675 --> 06:13.110
I'm taking a little trip here, Coach.

06:13.144 --> 06:14.511
You know where I'm going.

06:14.546 --> 06:16.180
Why do I keep looking down?

06:16.214 --> 06:17.481
I don't know.

06:17.515 --> 06:22.753
This museum is my favorite place
in Los Angeles.

06:22.787 --> 06:24.588
Um...
come on, Nick.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.590
Jess is making you babysit me, right?

06:26.625 --> 06:28.325
Babysit you?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.827
What?

06:29.861 --> 06:31.128
Like you're a little baby?

06:31.162 --> 06:33.564
No.

06:33.598 --> 06:35.232
- That's how you want to play this?
- Well, I'm not "playing" it.

06:35.266 --> 06:37.601
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

06:37.636 --> 06:39.003
- I just want to touch it.
- Don't touch it.

06:39.037 --> 06:40.270
- I just need to touch it.
- But it's not for touching.

06:40.305 --> 06:41.438
Hey, hey!

06:41.473 --> 06:42.640
What? Can I not jump on it?

06:42.674 --> 06:43.774
- Abby.
- That's not allowed?

06:43.808 --> 06:46.710
- Abby!
- Maybe I shouldn't climb all over the car.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.312
You need to get off of that car.

06:48.346 --> 06:50.614
Why don't you tell me
what it is Jess is up to?

06:50.649 --> 06:52.216
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,

06:52.250 --> 06:53.951
you're scratching the hood!

06:53.985 --> 06:55.619
Tell me what I want to know.

06:55.654 --> 06:57.388
- Get off there right now.
- There's nothing to tell!

06:57.422 --> 06:58.822
- Tell me what I want to know.
- There's nothing to tell!

06:58.857 --> 07:00.658
- Tell me what she's doing!
- Get her off!

07:00.692 --> 07:02.393
- If I tell you, will you get off the car?
- Yes.

07:02.427 --> 07:03.394
- You promise?
- Yes.

07:03.428 --> 07:05.223
She's looking
for a safe apartment for you

07:05.303 --> 07:06.930
'cause she doesn't
want you to live with us!

07:09.367 --> 07:10.934
Now, would you please
get off the car?

07:10.969 --> 07:14.004
Do you guys serve drinks here?

07:14.039 --> 07:17.508
Why don't they give us Tasers?

07:23.487 --> 07:24.812
Wow. I mean, this place is beautiful.

07:24.968 --> 07:28.625
It makes the other nine places
we've seen today just kind of fade away.

07:28.659 --> 07:30.860
Yeah, um, tell me
about the neighborhood.

07:30.895 --> 07:32.729
Is there a lot of nightlife?

07:32.763 --> 07:35.165
Well, this part of town is pretty quiet.

07:35.199 --> 07:37.500
Unless you count church bells.
Which you should.

07:37.535 --> 07:39.669
We have nine
within hearing distance.

07:39.703 --> 07:41.671
What about the other tenants?
Are there single men

07:41.705 --> 07:45.341
between 18 and 65?
Actually, make that 16 and 72.

07:45.376 --> 07:46.976
Most of the other tenants are

07:47.011 --> 07:49.712
middle-aged gay veterans
like myself.

07:49.747 --> 07:52.515
Oh. Whoa. Jackpot.

07:52.550 --> 07:55.151
And if the demons come calling,
there's an emergency room

07:55.186 --> 07:56.553
right across the street.

07:56.587 --> 07:58.021
You had me at "gay veterans."

07:58.055 --> 07:59.989
And then again at "emergency room."

08:00.024 --> 08:02.158
And before that at "church."

08:02.193 --> 08:05.595
I wish I could just travel back
in time and tell 19-year-old me

08:05.629 --> 08:07.697
to move into a place like this.

08:07.731 --> 08:10.600
Maybe I would've settled down.
Met a, you know, nice guy.

08:10.634 --> 08:14.070
Nothing flashy. Works in a bank,
makes a great veggie lasagna.

08:14.104 --> 08:16.072
- Okay, not now, Cece.
- No, don't stop her.

08:16.106 --> 08:18.308
Who is this guy?

08:18.342 --> 08:19.843
Right?

08:21.111 --> 08:23.079
Bet you are a mean dancer.

08:23.113 --> 08:25.114
Come on. Live a little.

08:25.149 --> 08:26.516
You were right to call me.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.585
Nobody deals with crazy
girls better than I do.

08:28.619 --> 08:30.587
Crazy girls are kind of my Hurt Locker.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.355
- You know what I mean, Nick?
- Okay. Yeah.

08:32.389 --> 08:35.091
Some-some men, they can
just walk away. Not me.

08:35.126 --> 08:36.793
- I just keep coming back.
- Okay, are you gonna help me

08:36.827 --> 08:37.924
- get her off the car?
- Mmm.

08:38.096 --> 08:39.256
- You know what this is, Nick?
- What?

08:39.429 --> 08:41.106
- This is nonsense.
- Exactly.

08:41.245 --> 08:42.116
And how do we deal with nonsense?

08:42.832 --> 08:46.436
No, no. We just don't stand
for it is what we do.

08:46.470 --> 08:47.704
Security is on the way.

08:47.738 --> 08:50.640
Come on, you old bird. Get up here.

08:50.674 --> 08:52.308
I can't afford it.

08:52.343 --> 08:54.978
I'm already the staff troublemaker.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.514
- Can you make it happen?
- I'm thinking.

08:59.583 --> 09:03.153
Where are you at right... Like,
is it kind of game... Yeah.

09:03.187 --> 09:05.755
Just shh.

09:07.391 --> 09:09.259
- I got it.
- You do?

09:09.293 --> 09:12.195
Yeah. No nonsense.

09:13.597 --> 09:15.565
Hey, Abby, look at me.

09:15.599 --> 09:17.400
Let's go get a taco.

09:17.434 --> 09:18.768
Okay.

09:18.803 --> 09:20.069
- You got to be kidding.
- There you go. Thank you.

09:20.104 --> 09:21.571
There you go. Perfect.

09:21.605 --> 09:24.440
Hey, you're not gonna tell Jess
I told you about the apartment, right?

09:24.475 --> 09:26.470
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe. We'll see.

09:26.672 --> 09:27.517
It'd be cool if you... 'Cause...

09:27.681 --> 09:28.766
Why don't you straighten
things up with the museum?

09:29.447 --> 09:32.148
Thank you. I appreciate that.
It's only ten dollars!

09:32.183 --> 09:34.184
That's not gonna...
It's ten dollars!

09:34.218 --> 09:36.486
You snakes.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.021
Follow through.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.189
Yeah, all right.

09:39.223 --> 09:40.523
Or else that creepy guy at the bar

09:40.558 --> 09:41.858
isn't gonna take his
hand off your thigh.

09:41.892 --> 09:43.126
Hands off my thigh, dude!

09:44.462 --> 09:47.130
Hands off my thigh, dude.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.501
What are you doing, dude?

09:51.535 --> 09:53.036
Stop stalling. Check your score.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.971
I'm not stalling.

09:55.005 --> 09:56.639
I'm gonna have Anders
work my core

09:56.674 --> 09:58.842
and maybe just go get some juice
with him.

09:58.876 --> 10:01.544
- No, um. No, I-I want juice. I'm...
- Hey, I bought your time.

10:01.579 --> 10:02.946
I do whatever I want with it.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.414
Go check your score!

10:04.448 --> 10:06.216
Hey, what are you doing?

10:06.250 --> 10:07.884
- No. Wait, what are you doing, dude?!
- I'm checking it myself!

10:07.918 --> 10:10.153
No! Come on, man!

10:10.187 --> 10:12.055
I said no, dude.

10:12.089 --> 10:15.158
No. W...

10:15.192 --> 10:16.659
What?

10:17.661 --> 10:19.395
You failed.

10:22.366 --> 10:24.400
I didn't even...

10:24.435 --> 10:28.505
You know, it's not even a...

10:28.539 --> 10:31.307
Yeah, it's not a big deal, so...

10:31.342 --> 10:33.643
You know, so...

10:33.677 --> 10:36.346
You should probably put
a passcode on your phone, dude.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.384
Hey, Schmidt!

10:41.418 --> 10:43.319
Hey, Schmidt.
Have you seen Abby?

10:43.354 --> 10:45.155
Huh?

10:45.189 --> 10:47.757
What... are you...
what are you doing?

10:47.792 --> 10:50.193
I'm melting chocolate.

10:52.863 --> 10:54.497
Abby and I are having sex.

10:54.532 --> 10:56.466
What happened
to no nonsense, Schmidt?

10:58.002 --> 11:01.037
I've really changed my tune
on nonsense, Nick.

11:01.071 --> 11:02.272
You know, for the life of me,

11:02.306 --> 11:05.041
I could not understand the grasp
that Jess had on you,

11:05.075 --> 11:07.177
but if she came from the same
gene pool as this one...

11:07.211 --> 11:08.545
kudos, my friend.

11:08.579 --> 11:10.547
Even if it's a tenth of what
I just experienced.

11:10.581 --> 11:14.217
Even if it'sa DeVito/Schwarzenegger
split from Twins.

11:14.251 --> 11:15.752
You calling Jess the DeVito?

11:15.786 --> 11:18.154
- What?
- Abby, I was supposed to be watching you.

11:18.189 --> 11:20.690
- Go ahead.
- Don't... don't play tricks with my words.

11:20.724 --> 11:23.059
Jess is gonna kill me. She's gonna say
my name in that short, clipped way

11:23.093 --> 11:24.961
- where she doesn't add the "K."
- What?

11:24.995 --> 11:26.896
When she's mad, she just says "Nic."

11:26.931 --> 11:29.866
Do you really think that the "K"
adds to the sound of your name?

11:29.900 --> 11:31.601
- Yes.
- How do you usually say your name?

11:31.635 --> 11:33.069
- Nick.
- Say it without the "K."

11:33.104 --> 11:34.804
- Nic.
- It's the same thing.

11:34.839 --> 11:36.306
Stop distracting me!

11:36.340 --> 11:37.707
Nick, you're so worried
about disappointing Jess.

11:37.741 --> 11:39.275
Relax, man.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.744
Okay, you got to get out of here.

11:48.919 --> 11:50.920
Oh...

11:54.686 --> 11:56.687
I choked.

11:56.721 --> 11:59.690
I choked, man. I'm 31.
I have nothing figured out.

11:59.724 --> 12:01.692
Can I not find a job?

12:01.726 --> 12:05.362
- I mean, I feel like I'm losing it.
- Dude, they're hiring here.

12:05.396 --> 12:06.897
You know I can't work here, man.

12:06.931 --> 12:08.165
They never have any cookies.

12:08.199 --> 12:09.166
It's all the better, man!

12:09.200 --> 12:10.167
There's no pressure.

12:10.201 --> 12:11.769
You get this job and then

12:11.803 --> 12:13.070
when you're ready, you
try the cop thing again.

12:13.104 --> 12:14.738
Okay.

12:14.773 --> 12:16.673
- See?
- Yeah.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.242
But now I'm sitting here thinking

12:18.276 --> 12:19.543
about how badly I need this job.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.378
- Stop!
- I need this job real bad...

12:21.412 --> 12:22.780
Excuse me, um, could we get

12:22.814 --> 12:23.914
a job application over here, please?

12:23.948 --> 12:26.784
In a way, I have a lot more
riding on this job

12:26.818 --> 12:28.185
than I do the cop thing.

12:28.219 --> 12:30.354
God, I'd love to work here!

12:32.090 --> 12:33.724
I got the apartment!

12:33.758 --> 12:36.059
The place is great.
The only thing I'm

12:36.094 --> 12:38.028
a little worried about is there
is a Russian grocery store

12:38.062 --> 12:39.930
down the block and Abby has
a little bit of a weird thing

12:39.964 --> 12:41.698
with ethnic white people.

12:41.733 --> 12:44.201
But I think she could
really thrive there!

12:44.235 --> 12:45.636
Where is she?

12:45.670 --> 12:47.204
- Where's who?
- Abby.

12:47.238 --> 12:49.139
Ab...? Oh, she's sleeping.

12:49.174 --> 12:50.240
By herself.

12:50.275 --> 12:52.609
Which is called "napping."

12:52.644 --> 12:54.945
Okay, I'm gonna start secretly
packing up some of her stuff.

12:54.979 --> 12:56.713
Do you think you can
keep distracting her?

12:56.748 --> 12:58.482
- Yes, yeah, you know, just...
- Good.

12:58.516 --> 12:59.950
how do we distract her?

12:59.984 --> 13:01.985
How do you distract a woman like that?

13:02.020 --> 13:03.387
Probably a guy.

13:03.421 --> 13:04.488
Right?

13:04.522 --> 13:05.923
Who can we set her up with?

13:05.957 --> 13:08.459
Well, well, well,
who do we have?

13:08.493 --> 13:10.127
Coach. No.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.962
Winston...

13:11.996 --> 13:13.230
That's actually kind of a good idea...

13:13.264 --> 13:14.598
No!

13:14.632 --> 13:17.301
- Schmidt!
- That's a terrible idea.

13:17.335 --> 13:19.670
But in the same sense...

13:19.704 --> 13:21.271
Abby will wreck Schmidt!

13:21.306 --> 13:23.741
- Well, then luckily, the...
- So, here's the plan.

13:23.775 --> 13:24.808
We're gonna have
a nice dinner, we're gonna

13:24.843 --> 13:26.276
get her buzzed but not drunk.

13:26.311 --> 13:28.746
And then we're gonna
casually and naturally

13:28.780 --> 13:29.947
bring up the apartment

13:29.981 --> 13:32.416
so she thinks it's her idea.

13:32.450 --> 13:34.118
- And I can do that, okay?
- Okay, good.

13:34.152 --> 13:36.587
- I'm glad.
- I'll act cool, natural.

13:36.621 --> 13:37.688
Casual.

13:37.722 --> 13:38.989
Au naturel.

13:39.023 --> 13:41.024
Au casual.
You know what?

13:41.059 --> 13:42.993
Maybe I should write
you some lines, pal.

13:43.027 --> 13:43.927
Yeah, I'd really
appreciate that 'cause...

13:43.962 --> 13:45.729
Maybe not a lot of words.

13:45.764 --> 13:50.300
Uh, so tell me, what are
your three weakest qualities?

13:50.335 --> 13:52.536
See...

13:52.570 --> 13:53.771
Just say "perfectionist."

13:53.805 --> 13:55.139
- Perfectionist.
- Yeah.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.376
And the other two... um...

14:04.416 --> 14:05.382
I'm overheating, right?

14:05.417 --> 14:06.884
I'm overheating, okay?

14:06.918 --> 14:08.385
So here's
what we're gonna do now...

14:08.420 --> 14:10.854
I'm just gonna shoot
from the hip, little rapid fire,

14:10.889 --> 14:13.624
give you some fun facts
you might not know about me.

14:13.658 --> 14:14.825
I hate standing up,

14:14.859 --> 14:15.859
I'm bad with numbers,

14:15.894 --> 14:16.994
and...

14:17.028 --> 14:19.430
I just honestly,
from the bottom of my heart,

14:19.464 --> 14:22.800
don't think women should be
allowed to handle money.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.835
Just, that's for real.

14:26.838 --> 14:29.440
Let's just move on to the salary.

14:29.474 --> 14:32.409
And you didn't even fill out
the back of the application.

14:32.444 --> 14:34.278
There's a back?

14:35.180 --> 14:37.181
There is a back to the application?

14:37.215 --> 14:38.715
- Coach.
- What?

14:38.750 --> 14:42.086
The LAPD exam...
maybe it had a back.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.988
You didn't check to
see if it had a back?

14:45.023 --> 14:46.323
We got to go to the precinct.

14:46.357 --> 14:48.258
I didn't choke.
I'm just careless.

14:48.293 --> 14:52.996
And that is my biggest
weakness, you bitch.

14:53.031 --> 14:54.998
- I'm so sorry, dude. I'm so sorry, dude.
- Yeah, that was bad.

14:55.033 --> 14:56.767
- Man, I didn't even mean that.
- All right, get out of here.

14:56.801 --> 14:59.203
- Get out of here.
- Dawg, I didn't mean that at all, man.

14:59.237 --> 15:01.739
To our newest resident.

15:01.773 --> 15:04.942
The City of Angels has sprouted
another pair of wings.

15:04.976 --> 15:09.046
It's a majestic city,
drenched in sunshine,

15:09.080 --> 15:10.447
that is actually just a collection

15:10.482 --> 15:13.350
of 75 different neighborhoods.

15:13.385 --> 15:15.185
Wow, I had no idea.

15:15.220 --> 15:17.321
Please continue to tell me more.

15:17.355 --> 15:19.623
- You want more?
- Who wants to rediscover couscous?

15:19.657 --> 15:20.803
Hey, what the hell are you
doing here, Schmidt?

15:20.959 --> 15:22.159
I invited him.

15:22.194 --> 15:24.228
- I live here, too, right?
- Yeah, but...

15:24.262 --> 15:26.063
It's okay, Abby can
make her own decisions,

15:26.097 --> 15:27.865
no matter what
they might lead to.

15:27.899 --> 15:30.367
- Thank you.
- Now, somebody call the pound

15:30.402 --> 15:31.802
'cause my stomach is growling.

15:34.506 --> 15:36.473
I said my stomach is growling.

15:36.508 --> 15:39.042
Sp... okay, uh, speaking of dinner,

15:39.077 --> 15:42.212
there are a lot of great options
in North Hollywood.

15:42.247 --> 15:43.547
It's a real hot spot

15:43.581 --> 15:44.948
full of young, hip people

15:44.983 --> 15:46.583
who will be the leaders
of tomorrow.

15:46.618 --> 15:49.453
- More wine?
- Great.

15:49.487 --> 15:52.923
If I were moving to L.A. now,
I'd say yes-ho to NoHo.

15:52.957 --> 15:54.425
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

15:54.459 --> 15:56.393
Oh, my.

15:56.428 --> 15:57.928
Stop touching him, Abby.

15:57.962 --> 15:59.630
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

15:59.664 --> 16:01.598
- Touch him more?
- Do not touch him.

16:01.633 --> 16:04.501
What are you...?
Do not do this right now.

16:04.536 --> 16:05.836
How about that?

16:06.971 --> 16:10.407
As luck would have it, I actually know
of a place in North Hollywood

16:10.442 --> 16:13.677
with great tile work.

16:15.780 --> 16:18.415
I said, "Great tile work."

16:18.450 --> 16:20.217
Oh, for the first 12 months.

16:22.787 --> 16:24.755
I think what you really
mean to say is

16:24.789 --> 16:26.857
there's an introductory offer

16:26.891 --> 16:28.892
- for cable television.
- That's it, yeah...

16:28.927 --> 16:30.027
Cable's a scam, I tell ya.

16:30.061 --> 16:31.228
Sa... Satellite.

16:32.530 --> 16:33.897
What happened to
no nonsense, Schmidt?

16:33.932 --> 16:35.632
Satellite's where it's at.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.301
Nonsense has the hands of an angel.

16:37.335 --> 16:38.635
Okay, what's going on here?

16:40.371 --> 16:43.073
I told Abby about the apartment,
and now she's...

16:43.108 --> 16:45.709
giving Schmidt a sp...
a special.

16:48.179 --> 16:49.379
Don't look at me.

16:49.414 --> 16:50.814
Just look away.

16:50.849 --> 16:53.717
Look away, look...
or look right at me.

16:58.330 --> 17:00.731
- So this was going on the whole time?
- Yes.

17:00.766 --> 17:02.700
And the hands are
just the half of it.

17:02.734 --> 17:05.202
I mean, there's been banging
and poking and scratching

17:05.237 --> 17:08.305
and hanging and teasing...
such teasing.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.741
I mean, really excruciating,
life-giving teasing.

17:10.776 --> 17:12.076
Shut up, Schmidt!

17:12.109 --> 17:13.109
She was talking to me.

17:13.145 --> 17:16.313
This has been a whole day of lying
and I can't take it.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.482
First I had to lie to Abby,
and so I spilled the beans

17:18.517 --> 17:20.017
- about the apartment.
- I'm sorry.

17:20.051 --> 17:23.154
And then I had to lie about Abby
and Schmidt and the boning.

17:23.188 --> 17:24.922
And then the manipulating

17:24.955 --> 17:26.523
and the out-manipulating...

17:26.558 --> 17:27.758
That's lying!

17:27.792 --> 17:31.262
If you guys were just honest
with each other for one second,

17:31.296 --> 17:33.364
none of this would
have happened.

17:33.398 --> 17:35.132
Okay. All right. Abby...

17:35.167 --> 17:37.601
I'm really sorry
I tried to trick you,

17:37.636 --> 17:39.670
but I just want
what's best for you.

17:39.704 --> 17:42.173
- One of us has to!
- You know, that is your problem.

17:42.207 --> 17:44.341
You think you're better than people
and you always try to fix them.

17:44.376 --> 17:46.210
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do.

17:46.244 --> 17:47.611
You've done it your whole life.
It's annoying.

17:47.646 --> 17:48.979
You know what? Yes.

17:49.014 --> 17:51.782
Yes. I would like to fix you.

17:51.817 --> 17:52.883
No...

17:52.918 --> 17:54.452
I would love to fix you!

17:54.486 --> 17:55.719
But I'm done trying.

17:55.754 --> 17:57.354
Because you're not changing.

17:57.389 --> 17:59.190
And you don't think or care

17:59.224 --> 18:02.359
about other people at all,
and I do.

18:02.394 --> 18:04.628
And that's why I don't want you
living in this loft.

18:06.932 --> 18:08.065
That's honest.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.634
You're a garbage person

18:10.669 --> 18:12.570
and you should live in
a Dumpster with rotten snails.

18:12.604 --> 18:14.572
Hey! Nick!

18:14.606 --> 18:16.540
- Too far!
- Yeah, way over the line, buddy.

18:16.575 --> 18:17.575
Yeah, but I thought
we were just piling in...

18:17.609 --> 18:18.809
That's my sister, dude.

18:18.844 --> 18:19.977
I didn't mean that, yeah.

18:20.011 --> 18:23.681
- Sorry.
- Well, lucky for you,

18:23.715 --> 18:24.982
I'm moving out.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.485
Oh, thank God, Abby.
Oh, my God.

18:27.519 --> 18:29.253
You're really gonna like this place.

18:29.287 --> 18:31.722
- It's so nice...
- I'm moving in with Schmidt.

18:31.757 --> 18:33.557
What... what's that, now?
You're moving in with who?

18:33.592 --> 18:35.126
- Seriously?
- We would have sex all the time.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.627
Dinner was lovely, you guys.

18:36.661 --> 18:38.195
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

18:39.798 --> 18:41.265
- What?
- Ooh. Hey, uh, Jess?

18:41.299 --> 18:42.666
Can I borrow your glasses?

18:42.701 --> 18:43.934
We're gonna role-play
as you guys.

18:43.969 --> 18:45.836
Ew. No.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.238
You don't understand.

18:47.272 --> 18:48.906
She's not gonna be you.
I'm gonna be you.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.374
Ugh! Get out, Schmidt!
Get out of here!

18:50.409 --> 18:51.809
Okay...

18:53.178 --> 18:55.046
Oh, God!

18:55.080 --> 18:56.947
What's up, my man?

18:56.982 --> 18:58.315
I took the test last week...

18:58.350 --> 19:01.619
or should I say, I took the front part
of the test last week...

19:01.653 --> 19:04.522
and, sir, I am here
to finish what I started.

19:04.556 --> 19:05.923
What?

19:05.957 --> 19:08.492
What he's trying to say is,
he took the entrance exam,

19:08.527 --> 19:10.027
but he forgot
to do the back half.

19:10.062 --> 19:11.729
Well, the test is
administered on a computer.

19:11.763 --> 19:13.130
There is no back.

19:16.702 --> 19:18.769
You took the test
on a computer?

19:18.804 --> 19:21.005
I choked. I am a failure.
I am a loser.

19:21.039 --> 19:22.673
I am never gonna
amount to anything.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.908
I'm never gonna shoot somebody.

19:23.942 --> 19:27.311
Dude. Have some dignity, all right?

19:27.345 --> 19:28.713
Thank you for your time, sir.

19:28.747 --> 19:30.381
Winston.

19:30.415 --> 19:31.515
Winston!

19:31.550 --> 19:32.950
Yo!

19:32.984 --> 19:33.784
Winston!

19:33.819 --> 19:36.587
Dude, you failed, man.

19:37.756 --> 19:40.357
You failed hard!
At everything!

19:40.392 --> 19:43.360
- Dude, this pep talk sucks.
- I'm not finished.

19:43.395 --> 19:45.162
Like, seriously, it's like
the Winston of pep talks.

19:45.197 --> 19:46.630
Look at me.

19:46.665 --> 19:48.065
You can do this, Winston.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.868
Because now there's
nothing to be afraid of.

19:50.902 --> 19:53.337
You hit rock bottom, man.

19:53.371 --> 19:55.072
This is the worst it's gonna get.

20:00.278 --> 20:04.915
Sir, it has been my dream
to become a cop.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.584
And no one's gonna
stand in my way...

20:06.618 --> 20:07.785
not you, not him...

20:07.819 --> 20:09.653
Hey, I was helping.

20:09.688 --> 20:11.122
...and definitely not myself.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.491
I would like
to retake this test.

20:13.525 --> 20:16.327
Well, there's one at 7:30 tomorrow.

20:16.361 --> 20:18.362
Man, what about my last score
makes you think

20:18.397 --> 20:20.431
I'm ready to take this test
again in 12 hours?

20:20.465 --> 20:22.033
He'll be there.

20:22.067 --> 20:23.367
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Yeah.

20:24.736 --> 20:27.905
Thank you for messing everything up
and being such a terrible liar.

20:27.939 --> 20:29.006
Uh, you are very welcome.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.542
I think I really needed
to say that stuff to my sister.

20:31.576 --> 20:34.045
- She's gonna wreck Schmidt.
- Oof...

20:34.079 --> 20:36.113
He has no idea.

20:36.148 --> 20:38.215
I'm sorry my family's so crazy.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.683
Crazy?

20:39.718 --> 20:41.152
Your family's not crazy.
My family's crazy.

20:41.186 --> 20:43.521
My father used to
trade horse semen.

20:43.555 --> 20:46.557
I've got an uncle whose
God-given name is Shifty.

20:47.926 --> 20:50.861
Well, thank goodness...

20:50.896 --> 20:52.296
we're the sane ones.

20:53.565 --> 20:54.899
So...

20:54.933 --> 20:57.968
- Okay, now, remember: Up, and...
- Uh-huh.

21:03.475 --> 21:04.608
Hello, Abby.

21:04.643 --> 21:06.577
Hey. S'up?

21:06.611 --> 21:08.479
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do

21:08.513 --> 21:10.147
if they pair you
with a dirty cop?

21:11.616 --> 21:14.719
Well, then, I would just
go to Internal Affairs.

21:14.753 --> 21:15.920
Well, that's a good way
to get killed.

21:15.954 --> 21:17.788
Then at least I would die a hero.

21:17.823 --> 21:19.657
Hmm, no, you won't.

21:19.691 --> 21:21.559
They'll put you in panties
and then they'll plant you

21:21.593 --> 21:22.793
next to a dead prostitute.

21:22.828 --> 21:24.729
That's a poor lady.

21:24.763 --> 21:26.764
It'd be a dude.

21:26.798 --> 21:28.666
But it's awesome!

21:28.700 --> 21:31.102
Good luck on the exam!

21:32.170 --> 21:36.639
They got dude prostitutes?
Nuh-uh.
