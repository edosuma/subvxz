WEBVTT

00:01.156 --> 00:02.636
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:04.371
BY THE WAY, WHO WAS
THAT MAN OUT ON THE BALCONY?

00:04.371 --> 00:05.439
I DIDN'T GET HIS NAME.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.275
UNCLE LOU IS FAMILY.
HE'S LYING.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.544
POP'S SAD.
I WANT YOU TO FIX IT, UNCLE LOU.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.113
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT, T.J.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.214
I'M DAMN WORRIED!

00:13.214 --> 00:15.516
THE COPS PULLED LOU
OUT OF THE RIVER

00:15.516 --> 00:16.717
WITH TWO BULLETS IN HIM.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.620
WHERE'S THE GUN, T.J.?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BAD.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.256
THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.725
THIS CASE THAT IS GONNA GET ME
ON THE FRONT PAGE

00:24.725 --> 00:26.694
OF EVERY PAPER.
WHO'S THIS?

00:26.694 --> 00:27.928
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY
AGAINST ME.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.530
I'M GONNA CRUCIFY HIM.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.973
HEY.

02:57.583 --> 03:02.123
MAN...IF I DIDN'T HAVE
THAT ARRAIGNMENT

03:02.123 --> 03:03.725
IN THE MORNING...

03:09.673 --> 03:12.042
HEY, CAN YOU GET ME
THE SHAMPOO?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
THANKS.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.409
"VOLUMINIZE"
TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT.

03:43.991 --> 03:47.561
HERE YOU GO.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.096
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DO THAT --

03:49.096 --> 03:50.397
EXERCISE SO LATE AT NIGHT.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.533
TOO MUCH CAFFEINE, I GUESS.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.869
I TOLD VAL,
NO CALLS AFTER 10:00.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.705
HELLO?

03:59.206 --> 04:01.008
UH, YEAH, HOLD ON, PLEASE.
I'LL SEE.

04:01.008 --> 04:05.713
IT'S FOR YOU. SOME WOMAN.
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE HER NAME.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.780
H-HELLO?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.515
Jack,
it's Brandy at the club.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.351
I'm sorry to call you
like this,

04:10.351 --> 04:12.553
but T.J. is here,
and he's talking crazy.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.688
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.657
IT'S A WORK THING.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.582
-- Captions by VITAC --

05:23.590 --> 05:25.759
HEY, THERE.
WELCOME TO PINTER'S.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.294
I'M LOOKING FOR BRANDY.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.328
I'M TINA.
I CAN HELP YOU.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.198
THANKS.
WE'RE JUST PASSING THROUGH.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.290
MR. KARSTEN.
BRANDY?

05:35.290 --> 05:36.542
YEAH.
WHERE IS HE?

05:46.513 --> 05:47.881
GENTLEMEN...

05:48.646 --> 05:50.050
...WE'RE GONNA NEED
THIS ROOM.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.222
WHY DID YOU CALL THEM?!
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT!

05:55.222 --> 05:57.157
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DRINK.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.293
I THOUGHT EVERYONE HERE
UNDERSTOOD THAT.

05:59.293 --> 06:01.762
HE SHOULDN'T MIX ALCOHOL
WITH HIS MEDS.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.897
I'M NOT SICK! I'M FINE.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.332
YOU'RE NOT FINE.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.101
THE POLICE WANT TO QUESTION YOU
ABOUT YOUR UNCLE'S MURDER.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.971
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY IN NO SHAPE
FOR THAT.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.206
AM I IN TROUBLE?

06:12.206 --> 06:13.640
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.043
BUT YOU NEED TO SLEEP THIS OFF
AND GET YOUR HEAD STRAIGHT.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.144
WE NEED TO GET YOU READY
FOR THEIR QUESTIONS

06:17.144 --> 06:18.412
BEFORE THEY BRING YOU IN.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.414
WE'LL PUT YOU UP IN A HOTEL.
NO.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.115
I'M NOT GOING INTO A HOTEL.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.617
T.J.
I WON'T!

06:23.617 --> 06:25.219
HE CAN COME TO MY PLACE.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.422
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.624
YOU CAN TRUST ME,
MR. KARSTEN.

06:30.624 --> 06:34.361
YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE SAFER.
IT'S MORE OFF THE RADAR.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.563
OKAY.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.365
ALL RIGHT.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.903
JUST BETWEEN US, OKAY?

06:44.671 --> 06:46.039
COME ON, T.J.

06:46.247 --> 06:47.274
LET'S GO.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.783
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A CRIMINAL LAWYER, JACK.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.385
WELL, NOT YET.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.554
LET'S KEEP THIS
LOW PROFILE FOR NOW.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.722
WE DON'T WANT
ANY MORE SCRUTINY,

07:01.722 --> 07:04.358
BUNCH OF PEOPLE SNIFFING
AROUND KARSTEN ALLIED.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.860
THEY FIND OUT ABOUT
THE MISSING MONEY,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.562
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
A MOTIVE --

07:08.562 --> 07:09.863
ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM THINK

07:09.863 --> 07:11.798
T.J. MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE
KILLED LOU.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.901
IT WON'T COME TO
THAT, ALL RIGHT?
I-I'VE GOT A GUY.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.637
I'LL TALK TO HIM AND SEE
WHAT THE POLICE HAVE GOT.

07:20.682 --> 07:23.685
THIS NEEDS YOUR FOCUS,
JACK --

07:24.376 --> 07:25.679
ALL OF IT.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.495
THANKS FOR PUTTING HER
TO BED, MARIE.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.831
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.169
YOUR PLACE IS VERY CLEAN.

08:22.169 --> 08:26.540
OH. I-I GOT YOU A PRESENT
LAST WEEK AT NAVY PIER.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.442
THEY HAD THIS...
SHOOTING GAME,

08:28.442 --> 08:30.744
AND I-I-I WON.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.879
WHAT'S GOING ON, T.J.?

08:36.583 --> 08:38.485
YOU COULD TELL ME ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

08:38.485 --> 08:40.153
IT'S A BUNNY.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.855
IT --
IT REMINDED ME OF YOU.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.257
PROBABLY 'CAUSE I'M THINKING
ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.626
OH.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.166
I CAN JUST SEE IT,

08:53.166 --> 08:58.138
LIVING HERE WITH YOU GUYS --
A HAPPY LITTLE FAMILY.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.974
YOU HAVE A FAMILY.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.143
NOT LIKE THIS.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.656
JACK.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.457
ORESTES.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.493
SORRY TO GET YOU UP
SO EARLY.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.995
YOU BEEN BUSY, HUH?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.131
YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR ME?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.565
MM.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.836
BUNCH OF RAMBLING MESSAGES T.J.
LEFT ON THE DEAD GUY'S PHONE.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.506
POSSIBLE EYEWITNESS
ON THE SCENE -- SOME VALET,

09:32.506 --> 09:35.108
MAYBE AN I.D.
OF THE KID'S CAR DRIVING AWAY,

09:35.108 --> 09:37.944
BUT NO MURDER WEAPON.
NO D.N.A.

09:37.944 --> 09:42.049
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT, UH,
CONNIE MROZEK, LOU'S WIDOW?

09:42.049 --> 09:44.184
IT'S A DEAD END.
SHE GAVE 'EM NOTHIN'.

09:44.184 --> 09:47.454
NOW, IT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR AN ARREST, BUT...

09:47.454 --> 09:51.258
THIS PROSECUTOR'S A HOTSHOT
WITH A THING FOR KARSTEN.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.794
HIS NAME'S DREW STAFFORD.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.995
DON'T KNOW HIM.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.030
SMART, YOUNG,

09:57.030 --> 10:00.333
GOOD-LOOKIN', THE KIND OF GUY
THAT MAKES IT EASY TO HATE HIM.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.503
HE'S OUT TO MAKE A NAME
FOR HIMSELF.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.541
THANKS.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.875
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.678
YOU AIN'T GOTTA DO ALL THAT.
I'M ALREADY ON THE PAYROLL.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.080
A LITTLE EXTRA.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.748
THAT POLICE PENSION'S SKIMPY.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.982
YEAH.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.319
MORNING. WHERE WERE YOU?

10:19.319 --> 10:21.054
WAIT. DON'T TELL ME.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.824
A KARSTEN CRISIS THAT I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.692
WELL, IF YOU EVER CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT THAT,

10:25.692 --> 10:26.927
JUST SAY THE WORD.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.030
WELL, I PROMISE YOU,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.698
THE DAY YOU STOP WORKING
FOR MY DAD,

10:31.698 --> 10:33.467
I'M GONNA GREET YOU
AT THE DOOR WITH A MARTINI

10:33.467 --> 10:35.635
AND ASK YOU
ALL ABOUT YOUR DAY.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.770
WHERE IS MY PHONE?!

10:36.770 --> 10:38.205
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA.
NO, WHERE IS IT?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.339
I DON'T KNOW.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.007
HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
SLOW DOWN.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.409
HE STOLE MY PHONE.
NO, I DIDN'T!

10:42.409 --> 10:43.877
HE TOOK IT TO LOOK AT PICTURES
OF MY FRIEND JESS

10:43.877 --> 10:45.445
WHILE HE PLAYS WITH HIS...

10:45.445 --> 10:48.081
HEY, NO, NO, NO.
AND NOW HE SAYS THAT HE FORGOT
WHERE HE LEFT IT.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.951
NOT A CRISIS, VAL.
CALL THE PHONE. IT'LL TURN UP.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.354
VIC, I'M PRETTY SURE JESS IS
NOT INTO GUYS WHO STEAL PHONES.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
AND WHY ARE YOU BOTH
NOT IN SCHOOL?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.924
WE'RE HELPING MOM
SET UP HER RESTAURANT

10:57.924 --> 10:59.359
FOR UNCLE LOU'S MEMORIAL.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.495
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT
I NEEDED YOUR HELP,
I ACTUALLY MEANT THAT,

11:01.495 --> 11:04.664
SO YOU NEED TO GO UPSTAIRS
RIGHT NOW AND GET DRESSED.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.800
GO.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.304
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.306
YOU MEAN WHEN DID WE BECOME
THE PARENTS OF TEENAGERS?

11:13.306 --> 11:14.341
I HAVE NO IDEA.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.209
THEY'RE LIKE WILD GORILLAS.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.944
WITH CELLPHONES.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.315
ARE WE UP FOR THIS?

11:22.315 --> 11:24.117
I THINK SO.

11:34.961 --> 11:35.962
MMM.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.432
WAIT.
THE KIDS ARE UPSTAIRS.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.304
YEAH, BUT...

11:45.505 --> 11:48.875
THE KIDS...ARE 16,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.076
SO THEY'RE EITHER
ON THE PHONE.

11:50.076 --> 11:52.012
THEY'RE ON THE COMPUTER...

11:52.012 --> 11:53.280
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING
RIGHT NOW,

11:53.280 --> 11:56.650
SO THEY REALLY DON'T CARE
ABOUT BORING...OLD...

11:58.585 --> 12:02.622
...US.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.526
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS SONG?

12:06.526 --> 12:10.297
THIS -- THIS WAS THE SUMMER
THAT WE GOT MARRIED.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.633
AT THE CABIN?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.273
HEY, I --
SHH, SHH, SHH.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.643
SO LET'S JUST BE 16
FOR A MINUTE.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.246
LET'S JUST BE
COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS

12:26.246 --> 12:29.482
TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT
RIGHT HERE

12:29.482 --> 12:31.952
AND RIGHT NOW.

12:55.704 --> 12:57.239
LOOK.
MORNING, SARA.

12:57.239 --> 12:59.608
HEY.
DID YOU BRING SOMETHING
FOR THE BAKE SALE?

12:59.608 --> 13:02.577
OH, I COMPLETELY MEANT TO,
BUT I FORGOT --
MY MOM DOESN'T BAKE.

13:02.577 --> 13:04.179
NOT A LOT.

13:04.179 --> 13:05.480
CAKE MIXES ARE
TOTALLY FAIR GAME.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.481
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE

13:06.481 --> 13:07.716
TO GRIND YOUR OWN WHEAT
OR ANYTHING.

13:07.716 --> 13:09.451
ALTHOUGH I DID TRY THAT ONCE.

13:09.451 --> 13:11.320
I MADE SOME AMAZING PANCAKES.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.323
OKAY, WELL, SEE YOU
AFTER SCHOOL, MONKEY.

13:14.323 --> 13:16.291
LOVE YOU ALL THE WAY
TO MARS.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.592
JUPITER.
SATURN.

13:17.592 --> 13:18.994
AND I WON'T LEAVE UNTIL...
I KNOW.

13:18.994 --> 13:20.362
OKAY.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.348
HEY, KATE.
YEAH?

13:22.348 --> 13:23.683
ARE YOU RUNNING
THE FUND-RAISER AUCTION?

13:23.683 --> 13:26.052
YEAH. BETHANY WEBER

13:26.052 --> 13:27.520
WAS IN CHARGE OF THE AUCTION,
BUT, UM,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.255
SHE'S GOING THROUGH HELL...

13:29.255 --> 13:30.656
WITH THE DIVORCE
AND EVERYTHING.

13:30.656 --> 13:34.060
OH, WOW. UM,
WELL, I'D LIKE TO HELP.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.262
I WANT TO GET MORE INVOLVED
WITH THE SCHOOL.

13:36.262 --> 13:37.897
I WAS THINKING
THAT I COULD DONATE

13:37.897 --> 13:40.399
A FAMILY PORTRAIT SESSION
OR SOMETHING.

13:40.399 --> 13:41.567
OH, WOW.
WOW.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.668
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

13:42.668 --> 13:43.836
PEOPLE WILL GO CRAZY FOR THAT.
OKAY, GREAT.

13:43.836 --> 13:45.504
MOM!
OKAY. UM --

13:49.108 --> 13:51.243
I'LL, UH,

13:51.243 --> 13:53.245
I'LL -- I'LL TRY AND DO
SOME BAKING LATER ON.

13:53.245 --> 13:55.414
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD,
RIGHT?

13:55.414 --> 13:57.817
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM,
BUT LET'S BE REAL.

13:57.817 --> 13:59.385
YOU'VE GOT
NO MURDER WEAPON.

13:59.385 --> 14:01.554
NO ONE CAN I.D. T.J. KARSTEN
AT THE SCENE.

14:01.554 --> 14:03.189
THERE WAS A VALET.
THANK YOU.

14:03.189 --> 14:06.392
WHO SAW A GUY WITH BROWN HAIR
200 FEET AWAY. IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

14:06.392 --> 14:08.661
LOOK, I WENT BACK
OVER THE WIDOW'S STATEMENT.

14:08.661 --> 14:10.930
THERE'S MORE THERE.
SHE'S HOLDING OUT ON US.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.431
DREW, LISTEN.

14:12.431 --> 14:14.767
KARSTEN AND HIS CASH
BUILT HALF THIS CITY.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.869
DON'T MAKE AN ENEMY
THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE.

14:16.869 --> 14:18.838
I JUST...

14:18.838 --> 14:20.239
CRAP!

14:20.239 --> 14:22.742
LOOK, FOR 30 YEARS,
THIS GUY HAS SPOOKED

14:22.742 --> 14:24.243
THE ENTIRE
STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

14:24.243 --> 14:25.711
INTO TURNING A BLIND EYE,

14:25.711 --> 14:27.980
BUT HE'S NOT A KING.
HE'S A DINOSAUR.

14:27.980 --> 14:29.548
HE DOESN'T SCARE ME.

14:29.548 --> 14:30.750
HE'S A T. REX,

14:30.750 --> 14:32.084
SO HE SHOULD.

14:32.084 --> 14:34.687
ALL THAT'S DRIVING THIS THING
IS SOME RABID PROSECUTOR.

14:34.687 --> 14:36.489
IF T.J. CAN HOLD UP
ON THE QUESTIONING,

14:36.489 --> 14:37.590
WE SHOULD BE OKAY.

14:39.091 --> 14:40.826
THAT'S QUITE AN "IF."

14:42.762 --> 14:44.296
LOOK, IF ALL ELSE FAILS,

14:44.296 --> 14:47.133
WE CAN ALWAYS BRING UP
T.J.'s...COGNITIVE DEFICIT.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.068
THAT'S IRRELEVANT.

14:49.068 --> 14:51.203
THERE IS NO DEFICIT.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.541
HI, JACK.

14:55.541 --> 14:58.010
YOU WENT TO THE CLUB
THAT NIGHT.

14:58.010 --> 15:02.148
NO, I TOLD YOU.
I-I WENT...T-TO SEE LOU.

15:02.148 --> 15:04.617
BUT IF ANYONE ASKS,
YOU WENT TO THE CLUB.

15:04.617 --> 15:05.985
YOU WERE WITH BRANDY.

15:05.985 --> 15:07.520
THAT'S WHAT I SAY?

15:07.520 --> 15:10.489
YES, T.J.,
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL SAY.

15:10.489 --> 15:12.324
OKAY?
YEAH.

15:12.324 --> 15:14.260
ALL RIGHT,
SO THE NIGHT LOU DIED,

15:14.260 --> 15:15.695
WHERE WERE YOU?

15:15.695 --> 15:17.363
I WAS AT THE CLUB.

15:17.363 --> 15:20.032
ARE YOU TELLING
THE TRUTH?

15:20.032 --> 15:21.100
THE TRUTH?

15:21.100 --> 15:23.269
YES. TELL ME THE TRUTH.
WHERE WERE YOU?

15:23.269 --> 15:25.504
I WENT TO THE RESTAURANT
TO SEE LOU.

15:25.504 --> 15:29.542
NO, T.J., THE CLUB.
THE CLUB!

15:29.542 --> 15:31.644
BUT HE SAID --
WHERE WERE YOU?!

15:31.644 --> 15:33.045
I...WENT TO FIX THINGS.

15:33.045 --> 15:36.148
IT'S USELESS.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:36.148 --> 15:37.483
YOU ASKED ME --

15:37.483 --> 15:39.318
L-LISTEN, BABE.

15:39.318 --> 15:40.986
YOU WERE WITH ME...

15:40.986 --> 15:43.756
ALL NIGHT AT THE CLUB.

15:43.756 --> 15:48.594
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT LOU
WHEN YOU WENT HOME.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.830
AND WHATEVER ANYONE SAYS,

15:50.830 --> 15:52.898
THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL THEM.

15:52.898 --> 15:55.434
HMM?
THAT'S THE NEW TRUTH.

16:00.372 --> 16:03.175
KEEP IT DOWN.
MY DAUGHTER'S SLEEPING.

16:03.175 --> 16:04.510
Sorry.

16:06.011 --> 16:08.948
SO, DID YOU SEE LOU
THE NIGHT HE DIED?

16:12.151 --> 16:13.586
I WAS AT THE CLUB.

16:13.586 --> 16:14.854
WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE
THE CLUB?

16:17.356 --> 16:18.657
I WAS AT THE CLUB.

16:19.725 --> 16:21.160
DID SOMEONE TELL YOU
TO TELL ME THAT?

16:21.160 --> 16:23.596
I WAS AT THE CLUB.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.668
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

16:29.668 --> 16:32.505
WE HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

16:32.505 --> 16:34.707
SOMETIMES I THINK
WE UNDERESTIMATE HIM.

16:36.609 --> 16:39.945
OKAY. SO...HE STAYS HERE
FOR THE TIME BEING,

16:39.945 --> 16:41.547
HIDDEN FROM THE COPS.

16:41.547 --> 16:43.783
THERE'S SOMEONE
I WANT TO TALK TO.

16:43.783 --> 16:45.484
I'LL DO SOME MORE DIGGING.

17:24.824 --> 17:27.059
Hey, you.
What's going on?

17:27.059 --> 17:29.261
NOTHING. I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HI.

17:29.261 --> 17:31.163
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

17:31.163 --> 17:33.165
I'M, UM, BAKING.

17:33.165 --> 17:35.434
AH, WELL, WILL YOU GET ME

17:35.434 --> 17:38.437
SOME BEEF JERKY AND TOOTHPASTE
WHILE YOU'RE THERE?

17:38.437 --> 17:41.240
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M COVERED IN FLOUR.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.943
Also, could you get some
of those stain-remover...

17:43.943 --> 17:46.245
WIPE THINGS? SPILLED ESPRESSO
ALL OVER MY SHIRT.

17:46.245 --> 17:47.680
I'M HANGING UP NOW.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.648
ME, TOO. PROBABLY WON'T BE HOME
TILL LATE.

17:49.648 --> 17:52.852
BYE.

17:56.956 --> 17:59.425
WE AS A SOCIETY CAME UP
WITH A SET OF MANDATES

17:59.425 --> 18:01.227
THAT DECLARE WE RESPECT
THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

18:01.227 --> 18:04.363
IT'S A COMMON CONTRACT
THAT PRECLUDES US

18:04.363 --> 18:07.366
FROM JUST KILLING EACH OTHER,
LIKE WILD ANIMALS.

18:07.366 --> 18:10.903
SO HERE'S THE THING.

18:10.903 --> 18:12.972
A MAN WAS MURDERED,

18:12.972 --> 18:16.909
AND WHOEVER COMMITTED THAT CRIME
BROKE THAT SACRED CONTRACT.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.410
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME
FOR NOT WORRYING

18:18.410 --> 18:20.613
ABOUT INCONVENIENCING
YOUR CLIENT.

18:20.613 --> 18:23.749
WELL, I'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING
YOU BROADEN YOUR INVESTIGATION

18:23.749 --> 18:26.886
TO OTHER POTENTIAL SUSPECTS.

18:26.886 --> 18:29.855
T.J. KARSTEN
HAS ABSOLUTELY NO MOTIVE

18:29.855 --> 18:31.223
AND A ROCK-SOLID ALIBI.

18:31.223 --> 18:33.692
THEN WHY NOT PRESENT HIM
FOR QUESTIONING?

18:33.692 --> 18:36.695
LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
AN AMBITIOUS GUY.

18:36.695 --> 18:39.465
DID YOU KNOW
THAT IN THE LAST 30 YEARS,

18:39.465 --> 18:41.800
THERE HASN'T BEEN
A MAYOR ELECTED IN THIS CITY

18:41.800 --> 18:43.669
WITHOUT THATCHER KARSTEN'S
SUPPORT?

18:43.669 --> 18:45.304
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

18:45.304 --> 18:47.373
MY POINT IS --

18:47.373 --> 18:51.343
HEY. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
HEY, BABE!
WHAT A SURPRISE.

18:51.343 --> 18:55.381
I WANTED TO BRING YOU
A CLEAN SHIRT...

18:55.381 --> 18:56.649
THANKS.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.721
OH, JACK McALLISTER,

19:02.721 --> 19:06.859
MEET MY BEAUTIFUL,
UNPREDICTABLE WIFE SARA.

19:06.859 --> 19:08.027
HI.

19:08.027 --> 19:09.762
NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:15.434 --> 19:18.837
UH, I-I SHOULD...LET YOU
GET BACK TO IT.
BYE, BABE.

19:21.273 --> 19:23.242
WHERE WERE WE?

19:23.242 --> 19:25.044
OH, I KNOW! WE WERE AT
THE POINT WHERE YOU INSINUATE...

19:25.044 --> 19:27.012
...SOME KIND OF POLITICAL FAVOR

19:27.012 --> 19:28.714
IF I GO EASY
ON THE KARSTEN KID.

19:28.714 --> 19:30.749
UH, I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW, I'VE -- I'VE, UH,

19:30.749 --> 19:34.253
I'VE GOT ANOTHER MEETING,
BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

19:34.253 --> 19:35.955
THANK YOU, JACK.

19:50.636 --> 19:51.637
SARA.

19:51.637 --> 19:53.505
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

19:53.505 --> 19:54.974
HEY, SARA.
HEY.

19:54.974 --> 19:57.142
YOUR HUSBAND'S A SLAVE DRIVER.
YEAH, I KNOW.

19:59.545 --> 20:00.946
THIS IS INSANE.

20:00.946 --> 20:02.047
I KNOW.
I CAN'T BELIEVE --

20:02.047 --> 20:03.248
WHAT WAS THIS?
WAS EVERYTHING

20:03.248 --> 20:05.050
SOME TWISTED KIND
OF LEGAL STRATEGY?

20:05.050 --> 20:07.886
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LISTEN TO ME.
LET GO.

20:07.886 --> 20:10.489
I PROMISE YOU,
I HAD NO IDEA --
LOOK, I DON'T --
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

20:10.489 --> 20:12.157
OR WHY YOU'D DO SUCH
A HORRIBLE THING.

20:12.157 --> 20:13.726
THIS IS OVER.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:13.726 --> 20:15.861
NEVER HAPPENED.
WE'RE DONE.

20:32.334 --> 20:33.668
■

20:33.840 --> 20:37.337
MICHAEL. YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

20:37.762 --> 20:40.198
I DON'T CARE
WHAT CORPORATE IS SAYING.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.599
I AM NOT RUNNING AN AD

20:41.599 --> 20:43.868
WITH A 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IN A CORSET.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.705
IT'S GROSS,
AND AS A PARENT,

20:46.705 --> 20:48.773
I SIMPLY WON'T SIGN OFF
ON IT.

20:48.773 --> 20:50.975
FINE. YOU WILL.
UH, BYE.

20:50.975 --> 20:53.144
"AS A PARENT"?

20:53.144 --> 20:57.282
SOMETIMES AN ALMOST-DEAD PLANT
COUNTS AS A CHILD.

20:57.282 --> 20:58.383
WHAT'S UP?

20:58.383 --> 21:02.187
I'M TROLLING
FOR AN ASSIGNMENT.

21:02.187 --> 21:04.189
WELL, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
ANYTHING UP YOUR ALLEY.

21:04.189 --> 21:06.558
JUST A...PIECE
ON THREE DAYS IN CHICAGO

21:06.558 --> 21:08.359
WITH PHOTOS
IN MILLENNIUM PARK.

21:08.359 --> 21:10.161
I'LL TAKE IT.

21:10.161 --> 21:13.131
SARA, I KNOW YOU.

21:13.131 --> 21:14.899
WHEN YOU ARE JUMPING
AT THE CHANCE

21:14.899 --> 21:17.135
TO SHOOT DOGS IN SWEATERS
AT MILLENNIUM PARK,

21:17.135 --> 21:18.703
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

21:18.703 --> 21:19.971
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

21:22.073 --> 21:25.777
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST --
I'M FEELING LIKE I NEED TO...

21:27.045 --> 21:28.680
...LEAN INTO MY LIFE MORE.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.217
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE
DOING A LITTLE TOO MUCH YOGA.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.621
I JUST...WANT TO BE --
I WANT TO BE BETTER.

21:36.621 --> 21:39.424
I WANNA BE BETTER --
BETTER AT WORK,

21:39.424 --> 21:42.160
BETTER AS A MOM,
BETTER AS A WIFE.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.996
HONEY, WHO DOESN'T WANT TO
BE BETTER?

21:44.996 --> 21:47.198
YOU WANT A REAL
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS?

21:47.198 --> 21:50.168
TRY GOING TO THE WEDDINGS
OF THREE DIFFERENT EX-BOYFRIENDS

21:50.168 --> 21:52.203
IN A 6-MONTH TIME SPAN.

21:52.203 --> 21:54.205
NOW,
<i>THAT</i> IS A HOT MESS.

21:57.008 --> 21:58.543
TAKE THE QUICHE AROUND
WHILE IT'S HOT,

21:58.543 --> 22:00.345
AND THEN COME BACK
FOR THE PROSCIUTTO, OKAY?

22:00.345 --> 22:02.180
JUST TAKE...
LOU ALWAYS
USED TO SAY TO ME,

22:02.180 --> 22:04.616
"EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL
IS INVISIBLE."

22:04.616 --> 22:07.752
AH. THAT'S A QUOTE
FROM A BOOK

22:07.752 --> 22:09.387
HE USED TO READ
TO THE KIDS.

22:09.387 --> 22:11.823
REALLY?

22:11.823 --> 22:13.758
BUT IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

22:13.758 --> 22:15.927
LOVE, TRUST,

22:15.927 --> 22:17.228
LOYALTY --

22:17.228 --> 22:19.597
THEY'RE ALL INVISIBLE,

22:19.597 --> 22:23.201
AND ALSO THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IN LIFE.

22:23.201 --> 22:24.836
I PUT ANOTHER $50,000

22:24.836 --> 22:26.571
IN YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER'S
COLLEGE FUND.

22:26.571 --> 22:29.140
I WISH
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.142
CONNIE, YOU'RE FAMILY.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.944
PLEASE DON'T.

22:32.944 --> 22:34.813
THERE'S NO NEED.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.415
UH, I NEED A MINUTE.

22:37.415 --> 22:38.583
IT'S ABOUT T.J.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.386
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:41.386 --> 22:42.787
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:42.787 --> 22:45.123
HE JUST CALLED
FROM THE POLICE STATION.

22:47.525 --> 22:48.560
I'LL TAKE ONE.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.728
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

22:50.728 --> 22:53.898
I'M PARTICIPATING IN
A SACRED POLISH DEATH RITUAL.

22:53.898 --> 22:58.303
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

22:58.303 --> 22:59.904
CONNIE.

22:59.904 --> 23:02.440
DID YOU SEE
THESE AMAZING FLOWERS?

23:02.440 --> 23:03.575
THEY CAME THIS MORNING.

23:03.575 --> 23:05.143
MY, WHO FROM?

23:05.143 --> 23:07.011
FRANK PERKINS.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.347
LOU'S PARTNER?
IS HE HERE?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.549
NO. HE'S IN HONG KONG
ON BUSINESS.

23:11.549 --> 23:13.318
HE...SENDS HIS REGRETS.

23:13.318 --> 23:14.919
MAY I?

23:14.919 --> 23:16.588
WHERE'S JACK GOING?

23:16.588 --> 23:17.655
WORK.

23:17.655 --> 23:20.692
YEAH.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

23:20.692 --> 23:23.461
WELL, IS T.J. COMING?

23:23.461 --> 23:27.131
NO.
HE'S STILL TOO UPSET.

23:27.131 --> 23:29.167
SO YOU LET HIM STAY HOME,
PLAY VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY?

23:29.167 --> 23:31.236
I DIDN'T<i> LET</i> HIM DO ANYTHING,
ELAINE.

23:31.236 --> 23:33.271
HE CHOSE NOT TO COME.

23:33.271 --> 23:35.340
HE WAS AFRAID HE COULDN'T
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

23:39.911 --> 23:41.746
YOU TREAT HIM LIKE A CHILD,
DAD,

23:41.746 --> 23:43.748
AND THAT'S WHY HE BEHAVES
THAT WAY.

23:43.748 --> 23:45.717
YOU ALWAYS WERE
QUICK TO JUDGE,

23:45.717 --> 23:48.820
BUT THEN YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO HAS TO LIVE WITH HIM,

23:48.820 --> 23:50.054
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

23:50.054 --> 23:52.891
TO FIX THINGS
WHEN HE SCREWS UP, EVER SINCE --

23:52.891 --> 23:54.759
SINCE WHAT?
SINCE THE ACCIDENT?

23:54.759 --> 23:55.994
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

23:55.994 --> 23:57.128
OF COURSE I CAN.

23:57.128 --> 23:59.230
LISTEN, YOU CALL IT
TAKING CARE OF HIM,

23:59.230 --> 24:01.266
AND I CALL IT
STUNTING HIM FOREVER.

24:01.266 --> 24:04.702
LOOK, TRUST ME.

24:04.702 --> 24:08.706
HE COULD NOT BE HERE
FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS.

24:08.706 --> 24:12.210
JUST...LEAVE IT AT THAT.

24:14.012 --> 24:15.380
IF SOMETHING
IS GOING ON WITH HIM,

24:15.380 --> 24:17.548
I DESERVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

24:24.055 --> 24:25.857
HEY, JACK.

24:25.857 --> 24:28.726
HEY, THANKS.
SEE YOU AT THE GAME.

24:31.062 --> 24:32.897
ARE YOU UNDER ARREST?

24:32.897 --> 24:35.600
NO, HE'S NOT.
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.936
WHILE MONITORING
THE RESIDENCE,

24:37.936 --> 24:39.070
WE CAME ACROSS
MR. KARSTEN

24:39.070 --> 24:40.638
AND ASKED HIM
TO COME IN FOR QUESTIONING.

24:40.638 --> 24:42.807
IS THAT SO? WELL, HE DECLINES
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

24:42.807 --> 24:44.909
AT THIS TIME.
ACTUALLY, HE DOESN'T.

24:44.909 --> 24:45.944
EXCUSE ME?

24:45.944 --> 24:47.312
IT'S OKAY, JACK.
NO, NO, NO.

24:47.312 --> 24:49.981
IT'S NOT OKAY. I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU TALK TO THESE GUYS.

24:49.981 --> 24:52.183
I-I WANT TO HELP THEM FIND OUT
WHO KILLED UNCLE LOU.

24:52.183 --> 24:53.918
I CAN DO IT.

24:53.918 --> 24:56.421
I'M JUST GONNA DO WHAT
I ALWAYS DO AND TELL THE TRUTH.

25:04.533 --> 25:05.201
■

25:06.235 --> 25:07.503
OKAY, GREAT.

25:07.503 --> 25:08.504
PERFECT.

25:08.504 --> 25:10.806
A BIT HIGHER, BILLY.

25:10.806 --> 25:12.408
YEAH, GREAT.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.283
<i>WAS THERE ANY PROBLEM</i>
<i>BETWEEN UNCLE LOU</i>

25:21.283 --> 25:22.418
<i>AND YOUR FAMILY?</i>

25:22.418 --> 25:24.787
<i>I WAS AT THE CLUB.</i>

25:24.787 --> 25:27.590
IS HE NOT RIGHT? IS THERE
SOMETHING OFF ABOUT HIM?

25:27.590 --> 25:29.758
HE'S NOT YOUR GUY.

25:29.758 --> 25:31.994
YOU SHOULD BROADEN
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

25:31.994 --> 25:34.530
<i>AND DID YOUR FATHER HAVE</i>
<i>ANY KIND OF BEEF...</i>

25:34.530 --> 25:36.365
<i>...WITH YOUR UNCLE LOU?</i>

25:38.200 --> 25:40.336
<i>LOU WAS FAMILY.</i>

25:40.336 --> 25:42.771
<i>WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER.</i>

25:52.681 --> 25:55.050
WHY WOULD THE POLICE
BE LOOKING AT HIM?

25:55.050 --> 25:59.154
WHY WOULD YOU THINK,
ELAINE?

25:59.154 --> 26:01.023
HE'S MY SON.

26:01.023 --> 26:06.228
IT'S ME THEY'RE AFTER.

26:06.228 --> 26:10.399
THE NIGHT LOU DIED,
<i>WHAT WERE YOU DOING?</i>

26:10.399 --> 26:12.935
<i>I WAS AT THE CLUB.</i>
<i>IS THAT THE TRUTH, T.J.?</i>

26:12.935 --> 26:14.670
<i>ASK BRANDY.</i>

26:14.670 --> 26:17.139
DID SOMEBODY COACH YOU?
DID THEY TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY?

26:17.139 --> 26:19.508
NO. I WAS AT THE CLUB.

26:19.508 --> 26:22.578
I CAN CHECK TO SEE
IF YOU WERE AT THE CLUB.

26:22.578 --> 26:24.947
I CAN GET CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV
FROM PINTER'S,

26:24.947 --> 26:27.349
EYEWITNESS REPORTS,
GUEST LISTS.

26:27.349 --> 26:30.085
I CAN FIND OUT
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

26:30.085 --> 26:31.887
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU LIE?

26:31.887 --> 26:34.657
YOUR NOSE GETS LONG.

26:39.595 --> 26:41.897
IT'S A CRIME, T.J.

26:41.897 --> 26:43.666
YOU CAN GO TO JAIL.

26:43.666 --> 26:45.200
WELL...

26:45.200 --> 26:46.702
WELL...

26:46.702 --> 26:49.505
I DON'T WANT TO LIE
TO YOU, THEN.

26:49.505 --> 26:52.541
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LIE TO US.

26:52.541 --> 26:54.343
SO

26:54.343 --> 26:56.779
LET'S START OVER, OKAY?

26:56.779 --> 26:58.047
OKAY.

27:03.819 --> 27:07.623
CONNIE?
ARE YOU LEAVING?

27:07.623 --> 27:10.125
THIS WAS LOVELY,
BUT I'M TIRED.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.461
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.732
I KEPT QUIET ABOUT T.J.,

27:16.732 --> 27:20.102
BUT THEY'RE
GONNA COME BACK TO ME.

27:20.102 --> 27:22.037
I'M SURE THEY WILL.

27:22.037 --> 27:24.807
AND WHEN THEY DO, I NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

27:24.807 --> 27:27.309
MAYBE YOU COULD REMEMBER
SOMETHING NEW.

27:27.309 --> 27:29.211
YOU WANT ME TO RISK
EVERYTHING I HAVE

27:29.211 --> 27:31.413
TO PROTECT YOUR SON,
WHO MIGHT HAVE KILLED --

27:31.413 --> 27:32.881
CONNIE.

27:32.881 --> 27:36.352
FOR 25 YEARS,
I CARRIED LOU

27:36.352 --> 27:38.354
AND YOUR FAMILY,

27:38.354 --> 27:41.290
DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS
A BUMBLING INCOMPETENT

27:41.290 --> 27:43.926
WHO WAS ALSO PROBABLY
STEALING FROM ME.

27:43.926 --> 27:49.365
SO...I WANT TO MAKE THIS
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

27:49.365 --> 27:55.037
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE,
I GAVE YOU.

27:55.037 --> 27:56.772
AND IT CAN GO AWAY...

27:58.107 --> 27:59.642
...JUST LIKE THAT.

27:59.642 --> 28:01.810
I SAW LOU AT THE OFFICE,

28:01.810 --> 28:03.579
AND THEN I CALLED HIM
A FEW TIMES ON THE PHONE.

28:03.579 --> 28:05.581
AND YOU WERE ANGRY.

28:05.581 --> 28:07.650
NO. NOT ANGRY.

28:07.650 --> 28:09.018
NO, NO, I JUST...

28:09.018 --> 28:11.820
I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW,
FIX THINGS.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.922
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID,
T.J.?

28:13.922 --> 28:16.291
DID YOU FIX THINGS? DID YOU
GO TO SEE YOUR UNCLE LOU?

28:16.291 --> 28:18.427
YES. I-I DID.

28:18.427 --> 28:20.663
I DID SEE HIM.

28:20.663 --> 28:23.966
OKAY, SO YOU'RE ADMITTING
THAT YOU DID SEE YOUR UNCLE.

28:26.669 --> 28:27.936
YES.

28:29.571 --> 28:31.507
<i>YES...</i>

28:31.507 --> 28:36.712
I SAW...A PICTURE OF HIM
ON THE TV

28:36.712 --> 28:40.249
ON THE NEWS AFTER MY DAD
TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED,

28:40.249 --> 28:42.918
AFTER I GOT BACK
FROM THE CLUB,

28:42.918 --> 28:46.021
<i>WHERE I HAD BEEN</i>
<i>ALL NIGHT WITH BRANDY.</i>

28:50.659 --> 28:53.328
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
YOU CAN ASK HER.

28:59.401 --> 29:02.438
ALL RIGHT.

29:11.947 --> 29:14.216
WELL DONE.
HE SHOULD GET AN OSCAR.

29:15.484 --> 29:18.220
WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON A LEGITIMATE SUSPECT

29:18.220 --> 29:20.856
INSTEAD OF CONTINUING
TO HARASS MY FAMILY?

29:23.125 --> 29:25.094
I'VE READ UP ON YOU.

29:25.094 --> 29:27.196
PARENTS CAME OVER
FROM IRELAND, RIGHT?

29:27.196 --> 29:30.699
DIED WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.
CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT...

29:30.699 --> 29:32.801
ON A KARSTEN SITE,
NO LESS.

29:32.801 --> 29:34.436
AND THEN, LO AND BEHOLD,

29:34.436 --> 29:36.772
THE LITTLE IMMIGRANT
ORPHAN BOY

29:36.772 --> 29:39.975
GETS ADOPTED INTO
A MIGHTY CHICAGO CLAN.

29:39.975 --> 29:41.410
WHAT A LUCKY GUY.

29:41.410 --> 29:44.079
WELL, MY FAMILY IS COMMITTED
TO FINDING

29:44.079 --> 29:46.548
THE REAL KILLER OF LOU MROZEK
IN ANY WAY WE CAN,

29:46.548 --> 29:48.984
SO YOU CALL ME,
COUNSELOR.

29:50.185 --> 29:52.621
YOU KNOW...

29:52.621 --> 29:53.956
TO WONDER...

29:55.190 --> 29:58.861
IS THIS THE LIFE THAT
YOUR PARENTS IMAGINED FOR YOU --

29:58.861 --> 30:02.231
THEIR ONLY SON GROWING UP
TO BE AN ERRAND BOY

30:02.231 --> 30:03.866
FOR THATCHER KARSTEN,

30:03.866 --> 30:06.235
A BAGMAN
FOR A GANG OF CROOKS?

30:07.836 --> 30:09.471
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, JACK,

30:09.471 --> 30:12.341
IS THIS THE LIFE
YOU DREAMED OF?

31:23.158 --> 31:24.225
■

31:24.225 --> 31:26.094
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.962
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW THIS IS AWKWARD.

31:27.962 --> 31:29.464
HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND ME?

31:29.464 --> 31:32.233
I CALLED
THE MAGAZINE OFFICE.

31:32.233 --> 31:34.602
THEY SAID
YOU WERE ON ASSIGNMENT HERE.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.504
HASN'T ANY OF THIS
HIT YOU YET?

31:36.504 --> 31:39.040
YOU WERE AT MY HUSBAND'S OFFICE
THIS MORNING.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.775
I'M WORKING, JACK.

31:40.775 --> 31:42.510
I'M TRYING TO WORK.
FIVE MINUTES.

31:42.510 --> 31:44.479
JUST SO I CAN EXPLAIN.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.615
WE OWE EACH OTHER THAT.

31:51.286 --> 31:52.887
JUST NOT HERE, OKAY?

31:52.887 --> 31:54.222
YEAH.

31:57.692 --> 32:00.595
UM, HELLO.
CAN I HELP YOU?

32:00.595 --> 32:02.096
YOU DREW STAFFORD?

32:02.096 --> 32:04.065
YEAH. WHO ARE YOU?

32:04.065 --> 32:06.468
SERENA SANGUILLEN, FBI.

32:06.468 --> 32:09.904
I'VE BEEN RUNNING POINT
ON A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

32:09.904 --> 32:11.306
TO THATCHER KARSTEN.

32:13.374 --> 32:14.742
WOW. WE SHOULD...

32:14.742 --> 32:17.779
DEFINITELY GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER, THEN.

32:17.779 --> 32:19.647
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

32:19.647 --> 32:20.949
I PROMISE YOU, UNTIL TODAY,

32:20.949 --> 32:22.750
I-I NEVER KNEW
WHO YOUR HUSBAND WAS

32:22.750 --> 32:24.752
OR THAT I'D EVER HAVE
ANY LEGAL MATTER WITH HIM.

32:24.752 --> 32:26.921
"LEGAL MATTER"?
IT'S A MURDER TRIAL.

32:26.921 --> 32:28.356
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH US.

32:28.356 --> 32:30.391
IT HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH US --

32:30.391 --> 32:32.160
WHO YOU ARE VERSUS...

32:32.160 --> 32:33.761
WHO I IMAGINED YOU TO BE.

32:33.761 --> 32:36.798
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A MISTAKE,
AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF

32:36.798 --> 32:40.468
FOR GETTING LOST IN SOME
STUPID SCHOOLGIRL FANTASY.

32:40.468 --> 32:42.804
IT ISN'T LIKE THAT.
IT'S NOT SOME --

32:42.804 --> 32:45.306
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY?

32:45.306 --> 32:48.176
YOU FIX THINGS.
YOU MANEUVER SITUATIONS.

32:48.176 --> 32:49.777
YOU MANIPULATE PEOPLE.

32:49.777 --> 32:51.679
YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL LIAR.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.582
APPARENTLY, A VERY GOOD ONE.
YEAH, I AM.

32:58.152 --> 33:00.922
EXCEPT WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

33:06.761 --> 33:08.029
I'LL GET IT.

33:13.535 --> 33:14.702
CAN I HELP YOU?

33:14.702 --> 33:15.870
HELLO.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.105
I'M A.S.A. DREW STAFFORD.

33:17.105 --> 33:19.207
I WAS HOPING TO SPEAK
WITH CONSTANCE MROZEK.

33:21.175 --> 33:22.710
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,

33:22.710 --> 33:24.479
AND MY AUNT IS EXHAUSTED.

33:24.479 --> 33:28.049
SHE'S ALREADY TOLD THE POLICE
EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.250
I'M NOT THE POLICE, MA'AM.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.752
YOU KNOW THEY HELD MY BROTHER
AT THE STATION

33:30.752 --> 33:32.554
FOR OVER THREE HOURS?
BUT THEY GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.789
I THINK THIS FAMILY'S
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

33:34.789 --> 33:36.357
HONEY...
THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED

33:36.357 --> 33:37.592
IS FOR YOU TO COME IN HERE
RIGHT NOW

33:37.592 --> 33:39.861
AND DRAG MY AUNT THROUGH THIS
ALL OVER AGAIN.

33:39.861 --> 33:42.363
COULD YOU EXCUSE US,
PLEASE?

33:42.363 --> 33:44.632
It's okay.

33:44.632 --> 33:45.733
OKAY.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.735
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

33:47.735 --> 33:49.003
OKAY.

33:53.174 --> 33:56.644
MY BROTHER
DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

33:56.644 --> 33:58.646
HE'S NOT CAPABLE OF THAT.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.353
SHE'S PROTECTIVE.

34:05.353 --> 34:08.056
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE FAMILY.

34:08.056 --> 34:10.058
YOU'D DO ANYTHING
FOR EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

34:10.058 --> 34:13.227
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT FROM ME?

34:13.227 --> 34:15.029
THATCHER KARSTEN THOUGHT
YOUR HUSBAND

34:15.029 --> 34:17.332
WAS STEALING FROM HIM.
HE WASN'T.

34:17.332 --> 34:20.335
LOU MROZEK WAS
THE MOST HONORABLE MAN

34:20.335 --> 34:21.736
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

34:21.736 --> 34:24.539
AND YET AFTER 27 YEARS
OF HONESTY,

34:24.539 --> 34:26.574
HARD WORK, AND COMMITMENT,

34:26.574 --> 34:28.343
KARSTEN HAD NO PROBLEM
BELIEVING

34:28.343 --> 34:29.510
THAT YOUR HUSBAND, LOU,

34:29.510 --> 34:31.713
EMBEZZLED A MILLION DOLLARS
FROM THE COMPANY.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.381
THAT'S WHY LOU DID
THE RIGHT THING

34:33.381 --> 34:35.383
AND HE WENT TO THE FEDS,
AND THAT'S WHY KARSTEN

34:35.383 --> 34:37.151
SENT T.J.
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

34:37.151 --> 34:39.487
NO, T.J. WOULD NEVER --

34:39.487 --> 34:41.055
T.J. IS BEING RAISED

34:41.055 --> 34:43.858
UNDER THE IRON FIST
OF A TYRANT.

34:43.858 --> 34:46.628
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

34:49.063 --> 34:51.799
MRS. MROZEK,
I KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM,

34:51.799 --> 34:52.900
THE CODE THAT YOU ABIDE BY.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.569
I'D NEVER ASK YOU
TO BETRAY THAT CODE,

34:54.569 --> 34:58.606
BUT YOU NEED
TO ASK YOURSELF THIS --

34:58.606 --> 35:01.776
WHO, IF NOT YOU,

35:01.776 --> 35:06.147
WILL BE LOYAL
TO YOUR HUSBAND?

35:06.147 --> 35:07.749
DO THIS FOR HIM.

35:07.749 --> 35:11.052
TELL ME THE TRUTH
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

35:16.224 --> 35:19.293
I COME HERE WHENEVER
LIFE GETS A LITTLE CRAZY.

35:19.293 --> 35:22.930
SIT AT A BENCH
AND LOOK OUT AT THE RIVER.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.569
SEARCHING FOR
BURIED TREASURE.

35:30.772 --> 35:33.675
I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK.

35:33.675 --> 35:38.680
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET ME OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.249
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING, TOO.

35:42.917 --> 35:44.085
BUT I CAN'T.

35:45.953 --> 35:49.824
YEAH, IT'S MESSY
AND COMPLICATED AND RISKY,

35:49.824 --> 35:53.394
BUT...WE CAN'T PRETEND
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN

35:53.394 --> 35:56.397
OR THAT IT DOESN'T
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

35:59.434 --> 36:02.103
THERE ARE THINGS
THAT I COULD SAY RIGHT NOW,

36:02.103 --> 36:05.440
THINGS I WISH I<i> COULD</i> SAY,

36:05.440 --> 36:09.177
BUT TALKING WON'T HELP.

36:09.177 --> 36:12.647
JUST MAKE THINGS
MORE CONFUSING.

36:12.647 --> 36:14.515
I'M NOT CONFUSED.

36:14.515 --> 36:16.317
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

36:16.317 --> 36:18.953
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

36:18.953 --> 36:21.656
I DO MAKE SENSE.

36:21.656 --> 36:23.224
THIS...

36:23.224 --> 36:25.226
THIS IS REAL.

36:37.772 --> 36:39.540
MY NEXT SETUP IS READY.

36:39.540 --> 36:42.110
WELL, COME BACK AFTER.
I-I-I'LL WAIT.

36:46.981 --> 36:48.216
I CAN'T.

36:48.216 --> 36:50.718
LOOK...

36:53.354 --> 36:55.256
MEET ME
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.160
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS IS.

37:03.498 --> 37:04.899
IF YOU DON'T COME,

37:04.899 --> 37:07.802
I WILL NEVER
BOTHER YOU AGAIN, I SWEAR.

37:11.139 --> 37:13.841
TONIGHT, 8:00, HERE.

37:27.369 --> 37:28.036
■

37:28.036 --> 37:29.970
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

37:29.970 --> 37:31.338
THE TRIP TO DUNE ACRES
WAS FRUITFUL.

37:32.940 --> 37:35.409
I SAW THE PROOFS.

37:35.409 --> 37:37.278
THE SUSHI PICTURES
LOOK GORGEOUS.

37:37.278 --> 37:38.879
OH, THANK YOU.

37:42.916 --> 37:45.886
I, UH, I RAN INTO SOMEONE
THERE --

37:45.886 --> 37:47.554
SOMEONE I JUST MET.

37:47.554 --> 37:49.723
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

37:49.723 --> 37:51.292
WAS IT?

37:51.292 --> 37:53.927
WHAT EXACTLY IS
A COINCIDENCE?

37:53.927 --> 37:56.397
OKAY, ARE WE GONNA NEED
A BONG?

37:56.397 --> 37:59.333
I MEAN,
IF TWO YEARS AGO,

37:59.333 --> 38:01.368
I HADN'T GONE
TO THE RUSCHA EXHIBIT

38:01.368 --> 38:03.771
ON THAT EXACT DAY
AT THAT EXACT TIME,

38:03.771 --> 38:05.139
IF I'D...

38:05.139 --> 38:08.375
GONE TO LUNCH FIRST
OR THE EL HAD BROKEN DOWN,

38:08.375 --> 38:09.643
THEN I WOULD NEVER
HAVE MET YOU

38:09.643 --> 38:11.612
AND NEVER GOTTEN THIS JOB

38:11.612 --> 38:14.815
AND NEVER BE SITTING HERE
RIGHT NOW.

38:14.815 --> 38:18.285
SO A RANDOM MEETING
HAS HAD THIS HUGE IMPACT

38:18.285 --> 38:19.320
ON MY LIFE.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.222
WAS THAT JUST
A COINCIDENCE?

38:26.527 --> 38:29.630
IT SCARES ME.

38:29.630 --> 38:31.231
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF YOU'RE LIVING THE LIFE

38:31.231 --> 38:34.001
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIVE
OR...

38:34.001 --> 38:37.338
THE ONE THAT JUST...
HAPPENED TO YOU?

38:39.239 --> 38:41.542
YOU THINK IF YOU WERE
AN HOUR LATER AT THE MUSEUM

38:41.542 --> 38:43.610
AND THAT WE NEVER MET,

38:43.610 --> 38:45.979
THAT YOU'D END UP LIKE
A TRUCK DRIVER

38:45.979 --> 38:48.916
INSTEAD OF A PHOTOGRAPHER?

38:48.916 --> 38:50.918
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
WE ARE VICTIMS OF FATE.

38:50.918 --> 38:52.686
WE SHAPE OUR OWN LIVES.

38:54.455 --> 38:56.090
SO...THE PATH WE'RE ON

38:56.090 --> 38:58.492
IS THE PATH
THAT WE WANT TO BE ON,

38:58.492 --> 39:00.461
THE ONE
THAT WE'RE MEANT TO BE ON.

39:00.461 --> 39:01.762
YEAH.

39:01.762 --> 39:04.598
EXCEPT WHEN A BEAR
IS CHASING YOU.

39:04.598 --> 39:07.067
THEN YOU GET
THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY.

39:15.843 --> 39:17.311
GET ENOUGH TO EAT?

39:17.311 --> 39:20.013
OH. THAT T-BONE
WAS LIKE SOMETHING

39:20.013 --> 39:21.415
OUT OF "THE FLINTSTONES."

39:23.617 --> 39:26.320
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU,
SON.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.124
MAYBE I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU
ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY.

39:30.124 --> 39:32.426
I'M GONNA FIX THAT.

39:32.426 --> 39:35.362
YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

39:35.362 --> 39:37.164
YEAH, I WOULD.

39:37.164 --> 39:38.532
OKAY.

40:29.183 --> 40:33.053
T.J.? T.J. KARSTEN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

40:33.053 --> 40:35.522
T.J.! DON'T RUN!

41:12.926 --> 41:14.628
UNH! AAH!

41:19.099 --> 41:20.634
UNH!

41:25.272 --> 41:27.508
I NEED BACKUP
AT HUBBARD AND WELLS.

41:27.508 --> 41:30.511
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.
