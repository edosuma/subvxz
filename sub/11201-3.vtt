00:13.610 --> 00:15.510
VALA: Funny, he doesn't look excited.

00:15.610 --> 00:18.940
Trust me. Like a kid
who was up all night on Christmas Eve.

00:19.050 --> 00:23.180
I thought we imposed a moratorium on
cultural references I wouldn't understand.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.270
So excited, he was up all night.

00:25.390 --> 00:29.580
It's only because he was worried sick
about the success of the mission.

00:29.690 --> 00:34.460
Get up, sunshine.
Time to see what old Santa brung you.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.930
Morning.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.220
- What?
- We just came out of hyperspace.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.770
I'm guessing you don't want
to miss the landing.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.100
What? What time is it?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.230
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO: This is the Captain.</i>

00:45.340 --> 00:48.330
<i>All hands take stations</i>
<i>for atmospheric entry.</i>

00:49.880 --> 00:51.500
Why didn't you tell me?

00:53.910 --> 00:57.080
Okay. He's a little excited.

01:00.620 --> 01:04.460
<i>MAN ON RADIO:</i> Odyssey, <i>this is Flight.</i>
<i>You are clear for landing.</i>

01:04.560 --> 01:06.960
Understood, Flight. We have the beacon.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.190
CARTER: Hey, you're just in time.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.130
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:14.230 --> 01:15.960
The number of times I tried to get here?

01:16.070 --> 01:18.470
Only two of those times were my fault.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.920
It is beautiful.

01:32.020 --> 01:33.950
<i>(ON RADIO)</i> Odyssey, <i>this is Weir.</i>

01:34.050 --> 01:36.520
<i>I wanted to be the first to say</i>
<i>welcome to Atlantis.</i>

01:36.620 --> 01:40.650
Thank you, Doctor. We're getting a good
look at your fair city even as we approach.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.160
<i>Feel free to take a moment,</i>

01:42.260 --> 01:44.730
<i>but Stargate Command wants you</i>
<i>to get started on your mission</i>

01:44.830 --> 01:48.290
<i>as soon as you've off-loaded our supplies.</i>
<i>Weir out.</i>

01:51.840 --> 01:54.540
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.940
I guess I just wish my first trip to Atlantis

01:57.040 --> 02:00.100
wasn't under such
desperate circumstances.

02:00.210 --> 02:01.840
MITCHELL: It's just
another mission, Jackson.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.850
One upon which the fate
of the entire galaxy hangs in the balance.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.250
And he goes on those all the time.

02:07.350 --> 02:08.880
CARTER: Vala's not wrong.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.980
If we don't succeed, and the Ori manage to
get more ships through that supergate...

02:12.090 --> 02:15.220
Well, like the lady said,
let's all just take a moment.

02:20.630 --> 02:23.730
Okay, moment's over.
Let's go save the galaxy.

03:45.050 --> 03:48.020
CARTER: The Ori supergate has been
inactive since they sent their first wave,

03:48.120 --> 03:49.150
but it's been reported

03:49.260 --> 03:51.620
that the Priors are promising
reinforcements for their armies,

03:51.730 --> 03:54.090
which are on their way
and should be here soon.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.090
Now, we can only assume that
that means more ships,

03:56.200 --> 03:58.600
and these four are already more
than we can handle.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.260
- We have to act now.
- Well, why don't you try dialing out?

04:01.370 --> 04:03.100
I mean, if it's powered by a black hole,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.640
you should be able to keep the thing up
and running almost indefinitely.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.870
I'm sure they thought of that
before they came all this way, Rodney.

04:08.980 --> 04:12.470
CARTER: It was what we were attempting
to do when the Ori fleet first came through.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.780
Now, the Asgard have since tried again,
but for some reason they can't dial out.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.050
- But you might be able to dial in?
- Well, that's the problem.

04:19.150 --> 04:22.180
It was designed to dial in
from another galaxy.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.090
Like one of the stargates in the Pegasus?

04:24.190 --> 04:27.490
No, no, no.
The diameter of a stargate is not arbitrary.

04:27.590 --> 04:29.620
There is a specific correlation
between the energy required

04:29.730 --> 04:32.560
- to create a stable wormhole...
- And the size of the gate. I know that.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.860
And it's exponentially proportional to size,

04:34.970 --> 04:38.340
which means the energy required
to create a connection with a supergate

04:38.440 --> 04:40.840
would far exceed that of an ordinary gate.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.910
It'd be like putting together
a Saint Bernard and a Chihuahua.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.170
And the problem with that would be...

04:47.280 --> 04:49.180
Well, obviously it's a question of...

04:52.250 --> 04:56.090
Oh, I see. You're mocking me, aren't you?

04:56.190 --> 04:59.520
What? No. I'm not from Earth.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.490
I honestly didn't get the reference.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.720
Oh. Oh, well, they're both dogs...

05:03.830 --> 05:05.160
McKay.

05:05.270 --> 05:08.260
Colonel Carter, please continue.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.960
If he speaks again, I'll shoot him.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.100
But to answer your question,

05:12.210 --> 05:14.000
we are introducing another stargate
into the equation.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.200
Teal'c should have it in position right now.

05:16.310 --> 05:19.510
If we can make a connection between that
gate and one from the Pegasus Galaxy...

05:19.610 --> 05:21.210
You're going to try and make a jump.
Don't shoot me.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.550
You know I can't help myself.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.310
Jump? Can you do that?

05:25.420 --> 05:29.450
One of Colonel Carter's more brilliant
planet-saving ideas from a few years back.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.920
Stargate Command inadvertently dialed
the gate address of a planet

05:32.030 --> 05:34.490
that was on a collision course
with a black hole.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.620
P3W-451, if memory serves.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.630
The only way to disconnect before
Cheyenne Mountain got swallowed up

05:39.730 --> 05:42.670
was to set off a shaped charge
right at the event horizon.

05:42.770 --> 05:45.570
Now, that energy spike
forced our outgoing wormhole

05:45.670 --> 05:48.370
to jump to another stargate
that was relatively close by.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.340
MITCHELL: And if we can do it again, we
can tie up the Ori supergate indefinitely.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.410
Even if you were able to establish
an initial connection...

05:53.510 --> 05:55.570
- We need a nuke. We know.
- And a dialing crystal capable of...

05:55.680 --> 05:56.670
Already have one.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.980
And if you want to keep the connection
open for more than 38 minutes,

05:59.090 --> 06:01.320
you'll need to find a black hole
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

06:01.420 --> 06:04.410
This is not our first barbecue, Dr. McKay.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.430
I am just saying, the yield calculations
can be extremely tricky,

06:07.530 --> 06:10.290
if not borderline impossible.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.590
You may need me.

06:11.930 --> 06:12.920
(CHUCKLES)

06:13.030 --> 06:14.470
Colonel Carter said as much.

06:14.570 --> 06:15.590
(EX CLAIMS)

06:15.700 --> 06:17.500
We weren't going to tell him that.

06:19.570 --> 06:23.630
John, do you think you could spare
Rodney from your team?

06:23.740 --> 06:25.970
Hell, you can keep him.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.240
Nice.

06:32.750 --> 06:36.810
I got to tell you, Sheppard,
it's a nice place you got here.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.020
Thanks. We just painted.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.600
Well, good luck. And listen,
if McKay gives you a hard time, just...

06:44.700 --> 06:45.930
Shoot him.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.130
- Also, he's mortally allergic to citrus.
- Really?

06:49.240 --> 06:52.030
I keep one with me at all times.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.970
Just a comfort to know

06:54.670 --> 06:55.640
it's there.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.800
- That's good intel. Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:59.450 --> 07:03.010
(STAMMERS) That's a good one.
We're actually... We're quite close.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.340
Have you packed your bags?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.450
Oh, right, right.

07:11.590 --> 07:12.680
All right, be good.

07:12.790 --> 07:14.620
Yeah, good luck.
I wish I was going with you.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.920
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.000
This place is Daniel Disneyland. Wow.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.070
- Just find the weapon.
- No pressure.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.800
Yes, your desire to access
the Atlantis database

07:27.910 --> 07:29.400
has seemed quite urgent, Dr. Jackson.

07:29.510 --> 07:32.500
- Shall we?
- Where's Vala?

07:35.380 --> 07:37.320
Oh, this way.

07:50.230 --> 07:53.130
Well, Daniel, no wonder
you've been obsessing about coming here.

07:53.230 --> 07:58.970
This place must be
full of so many wonderful souvenirs.

07:59.670 --> 08:01.770
How much of the city
have you been able to explore?

08:01.880 --> 08:04.710
Just over half now,
but we have the city schematics,

08:04.810 --> 08:07.800
so we have a fairly good idea
of what's where.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.380
Still, there are entire sections of the city,
and whole systems,

08:12.490 --> 08:14.220
we don't even pretend to understand.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.090
- Yeah, you could spend a lifetime trying.
- I hope to.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.990
I ran that search you asked for.

08:20.090 --> 08:23.460
I entered every pronunciation of
Castiana and Sahal I could come up with.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.290
And nothing.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.830
You didn't actually expect either
of those names to be in there, did you?

08:27.930 --> 08:31.270
- No.
- Did you get the spelling right?

08:31.370 --> 08:33.130
Well, that's the problem
with Ancient languages.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.070
The pronunciation can change
within a handful of generations,

08:36.180 --> 08:37.840
let alone thousands of years.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.810
The etymology of an individual word
can be lost entirely.

08:40.910 --> 08:42.810
Still, we know there's something
in the Atlantis library.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.850
Hey, do we have to go in there
straightaway?

08:44.950 --> 08:47.220
Can we do some sightseeing first?

08:47.320 --> 08:48.840
Maybe later.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.490
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO: This is the Captain.</i>
<i>Stand by for liftoff.</i>

09:04.100 --> 09:05.940
You can check
my preliminary yield calculations.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.140
- They're on that station over there.
- I'm sure they're fine.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.270
It's the reason you're here, McKay.

09:12.380 --> 09:16.710
Right, but first I just wanted to thank you
for being there for me recently,

09:16.820 --> 09:19.050
in a time of great personal need.

09:19.150 --> 09:24.060
Well, actually, you weren't there,
I was alone in the dark,

09:24.160 --> 09:27.350
but, you know,
it sure seemed like you were.

09:27.460 --> 09:30.860
- Are you telling me one of your fantasies?
- No, it was a hallucination.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.330
Look, I had a concussion, I was trapped
in the back of a sinking Jumper,

09:33.430 --> 09:35.490
and my mind conjured you up
as a means of survival.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.070
It's just what you would do
in my situation.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.040
Saved my life.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.700
Okay, well, that's

09:41.010 --> 09:43.100
- sort of nice.
- Yes, it was.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.810
- Was I naked?
- Partially.

09:47.910 --> 09:50.180
Check my calculations, McKay.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.590
We use this room sparingly now.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.190
It's a bit of a power hog,

10:03.300 --> 10:05.920
and we can access the database
from workstations throughout the city

10:06.030 --> 10:07.690
when we need to.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.700
But for the first-time user,

10:10.500 --> 10:11.940
this is the place.

10:15.510 --> 10:16.500
<i>Hello.</i>

10:16.610 --> 10:19.080
It's as simple as asking questions
to the holographic interface.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.200
For example...

10:20.310 --> 10:22.250
<i>MAN ON RADIO: Dr. Weir</i>
<i>to Stargate Operations.</i>

10:22.350 --> 10:23.410
I'm sorry.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.180
I'll be right there.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.820
The interface can walk you
through your search until I get back.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.580
Oh, I should probably warn you.
If she seems a little bit patronizing,

10:30.690 --> 10:34.560
the program was designed to teach
very young children the Lantian systems.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.090
Thank you.

10:41.130 --> 10:42.190
<i>Hello.</i>

10:42.300 --> 10:45.100
Hello, we're looking for a couple of planets
in the Milky Way.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.800
- Vala.
- What?

10:46.910 --> 10:48.570
What can it hurt to ask?

10:48.680 --> 10:50.370
<i>You may enter your query verbally</i>

10:50.480 --> 10:52.970
<i>or by entering it manually</i>
<i>on the console before you.</i>

10:53.080 --> 10:56.110
I'll speak, if that's all right.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.310
<i>Of course, but note for future sessions,</i>

10:58.420 --> 11:02.410
<i>manual input is required</i>
<i>for most system interaction.</i>

11:02.520 --> 11:05.010
I think I had her in grade five.

11:18.100 --> 11:22.730
Maintain orbit at minimum safe distance
and keep sublight engines on standby.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.970
Is that thing cool or what?

11:29.680 --> 11:31.620
The black hole.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.710
What you're looking at
is called the accretion disk.

11:33.820 --> 11:38.690
It's matter trapped in the gravity well.
You can't actually see the black hole itself.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.490
Which is cool.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.630
We're in optimal range
for releasing the gate.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.430
We can commit to the next phase.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.700
This is Emerson to Flight Operations.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.480
Release the gate.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.140
Well, it's going to be a few minutes

12:24.240 --> 12:26.500
before the gate's in position
and ready to dial out,

12:26.610 --> 12:29.230
and I missed lunch,
so I'm going to fix myself a sandwich.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.870
Anyone want anything? Anyone?

12:33.350 --> 12:36.800
No? No? Fine.

12:45.260 --> 12:49.420
Okay, that's Earth, and that is Taonas.

12:49.530 --> 12:52.520
<i>Praclarush Taonas was one of</i>
<i>the earliest Lantian cities.</i>

12:52.630 --> 12:54.360
<i>It was abandoned</i>
<i>when the inhabitants learned</i>

12:54.470 --> 12:55.800
<i>their sun was nearing the end of its life.</i>

12:55.900 --> 12:56.890
Yes, thank you, I know. I've been there.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.910
Okay, show me the order in which
the earliest Ancient cities were founded.

13:02.010 --> 13:02.980
VALA: How is that useful?

13:03.080 --> 13:04.840
You gonna join up all the dots
and draw a pretty picture?

13:04.940 --> 13:05.910
JACKSON: I'm just getting my bearings.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.810
You're gonna have to get used to the fact
this is probably going to take a while.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.040
The way you approach things,
it could take the rest of our lives.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.140
I'm sorry, but we're not going
to find the location of this thing

13:13.250 --> 13:16.350
- by looking under "W" for weapon.
- "P" for planet, then?

13:16.460 --> 13:18.250
I'm just saying, ask the question.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.090
Dr. Weir already tried it.
It'd be a complete waste of time.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.990
It would take all of 11 seconds.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.460
Hello, we're looking for the names of two
planets known on Earth in ancient times

13:26.570 --> 13:30.700
in the dialect of Old English
as Castiana and Sahal. Satisfied?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.600
<i>Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.</i>

13:40.580 --> 13:42.570
Now I'm satisfied.

13:46.820 --> 13:47.880
(SIGHS)

13:47.990 --> 13:49.350
See, Daniel?

13:50.260 --> 13:51.590
Doesn't hurt to ask.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.710
Gate telemetry checks out.

14:08.810 --> 14:11.940
Stabilizing thrusters are online
and power is well into the green.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.070
We're good to go.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.110
- Where's McKay?
- I'm here.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.340
One of your crew wouldn't let me finish
my sandwich in the corridor.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.940
Oh, the nerve of that crewman, huh?

14:22.660 --> 14:24.560
We're about to try a connection.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.490
Go ahead. That's the easy part.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.720
Thank you. I've already sent
the remote dial command.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.700
It's just going to take a while
because of time dilation.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.770
Right.

14:38.340 --> 14:41.140
- Wormhole is established.
- Of course it is.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.910
Teal'c, I have a collect call
from the Pegasus Galaxy.

14:48.010 --> 14:50.110
Will you accept the charges?

14:51.820 --> 14:53.840
<i>TEAL 'C: I will indeed, Colonel Mitchell.</i>

14:53.950 --> 14:56.850
Hey! How are things back home
in the Milky Way?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.260
Secondary gate is in position.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.320
There has been no sign of Ori activity
since my arrival at the supergate,

15:06.430 --> 15:09.560
which was, in fact, several hours ago.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.870
<i>MITCHELL: Well, we're about to get</i>
<i>the party started, so just hang loose.</i>

15:18.650 --> 15:21.240
<i>TEAL 'C: I am hanging loosely,</i>
<i>Colonel Mitchell.</i>

15:21.350 --> 15:24.340
Is it just me,
or does his voice sound deeper?

15:24.450 --> 15:28.050
It's the time-dilation effect
of the black hole. Can't be helped.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.450
Right.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.890
So. Who wants to set off
a big old firecracker?

15:33.990 --> 15:37.900
A 26-megaton, directed-energy firecracker,
you mean.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.730
Not until we decrease the yield
by at least 5%.

15:39.830 --> 15:40.890
CARTER: I knew
you were going to say that.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.660
Oh, forgive me for not wanting to vaporize
the stargate on our first attempt.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.430
We're on a clock, McKay.
We have to take the risk.

15:47.540 --> 15:50.570
You know, I find your recklessness so...

15:54.580 --> 15:56.170
Teal'c, it's Sam.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.310
We're about to launch the first warhead
to the preprogrammed coordinates.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.410
Are you at a safe distance
from both gates?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.520
<i>TEAL 'C: I am.</i>

16:05.530 --> 16:09.390
<i>EMERSON ON PA: Attention, all hands.</i>
<i>Stand by. Launching first warhead.</i>

16:09.500 --> 16:14.360
Beaming device in three, two, one, mark.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.240
Teal'c, what's the good news?

16:31.620 --> 16:33.050
The delay is annoying.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.520
Black hole time dilation, can't be helped.

16:35.620 --> 16:40.490
<i>The news is not good, Colonel Mitchell.</i>
<i>The first attempt was unsuccessful.</i>

16:41.290 --> 16:43.990
Okay. Let's try again.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.500
- VALA: Daniel.
- Hmm.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.440
We got what we came for.

16:52.940 --> 16:53.960
I know.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.630
Shouldn't we be out there
telling someone?

16:55.740 --> 16:56.940
Not yet.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.910
Okay, well, she told us
the name of the planets.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.640
They were right up there,
glowing in the ceiling.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.080
Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.010
She even gave us the addresses,

17:06.120 --> 17:09.020
which means we could be out there
somewhere, overlooking Atlantis,

17:09.120 --> 17:11.820
toasting with exotic beverages.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.330
- There's something else going on.
- What?

17:15.430 --> 17:16.520
Well,

17:18.160 --> 17:19.720
it shouldn't have worked.

17:21.070 --> 17:23.330
I mean, I didn't expect it to
when I asked Elizabeth to try,

17:23.440 --> 17:26.340
but I thought
there'd at least be some remnant,

17:26.440 --> 17:30.270
some vague similarity
between the words Castiana and Sahal

17:30.380 --> 17:33.310
and their Ancient language counterparts.

17:33.410 --> 17:36.940
- She wouldn't lie.
- I don't know.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.540
But explain this to me.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.950
How can this database
translate, in real time,

17:41.050 --> 17:45.820
a language spoken 8,000 years
after the Ancients abandoned Atlantis?

17:49.460 --> 17:51.120
That's a tough one.

17:55.670 --> 17:59.730
Is there an archival visual record of
the Lantian citizens who fled to Earth?

18:00.340 --> 18:01.570
<i>There is.</i>

18:02.140 --> 18:03.570
Display them for me.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.430
One at a time.

18:13.490 --> 18:16.350
No, no, no, no,
those yield calculations are perfectly fine.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.650
- They are?
- Lf your goal is to blow up the stargate.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.190
Anything less and it won't add
enough energy to the matter stream

18:21.290 --> 18:22.350
to make a jump to the stargate.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.900
And anything more
and the stargate will be destroyed.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.930
Look, you want to run high voltage,
but you've only got an extension cord.

18:27.030 --> 18:28.160
It's impossible, and I told you so

18:28.270 --> 18:30.630
- before we left Atlantis.
- No, you said it was borderline impossible.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.000
Yes, well, we've crossed the border!

18:32.110 --> 18:33.270
But, hey, you know, don't let me stop you.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.240
Go calibrate your warhead.
Beam your bomb.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.540
You know, Sam, this is not
the Rodney McKay I heard stories about.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.870
- I know.
- What stories? What have you heard?

18:38.980 --> 18:39.950
Well, for starters,

18:40.050 --> 18:41.640
that you didn't know the meaning
of the word "impossible."

18:41.750 --> 18:42.740
Well, I certainly know the meaning...

18:42.850 --> 18:45.370
And that under threat of impending death,
you could work absolute miracles.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.450
I suppose Sheppard told you that?

18:46.550 --> 18:47.850
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, well, it's all true,

18:47.950 --> 18:49.440
but I'm not under
the threat of impending death,

18:49.560 --> 18:51.150
and I don't have...

18:53.760 --> 18:54.850
Not yet.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.430
Keep it up.

18:58.530 --> 19:02.260
Well, I'll see
what I can come up with, then.

19:07.670 --> 19:09.440
You know, Cam, he's not wrong.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.940
As much as it pains me to say it,

19:11.040 --> 19:13.100
the data from our first attempt
supports his argument.

19:13.210 --> 19:16.200
Well, like my grandma used to say,
if at first you don't succeed...

19:16.320 --> 19:19.220
Try a larger thermonuclear reaction?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.410
Her words exactly.

19:30.860 --> 19:34.390
Well, exciting as it is to view
the Atlantis family album...

19:34.500 --> 19:36.730
I'm looking for someone in particular.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.570
I don't know
of any 10,000-year-old Ancients.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.880
I take that back. We know him.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.720
<i>Moros was</i>
<i>the last High Councilor of Atlantis.</i>

19:55.820 --> 19:57.380
Moros?

19:57.490 --> 20:00.080
Well, apart from the funny hat,
he's the spitting image of Merlin, isn't he?

20:00.190 --> 20:01.320
See, in Arthur's time, it was Myrdin.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.260
You see how a word can change
over the centuries.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.520
I know where you're going.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.930
You think that Merlin, or Myrdin,
or whatever his name was,

20:09.040 --> 20:10.700
came back to Atlantis at some stage

20:10.800 --> 20:14.710
and hid these names here
as clues for us to find.

20:14.810 --> 20:15.930
- No.
- No.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.770
<i>The first human to set foot within the city</i>
<i>after it was abandoned</i>

20:18.880 --> 20:22.750
<i>was Dr. Elizabeth Weir,</i>
<i>leader of the current Atlantis expedition.</i>

20:22.850 --> 20:24.280
Are you sure of that?

20:24.380 --> 20:27.150
<i>Evidence of his presence</i>
<i>would have been recorded.</i>

20:28.960 --> 20:31.690
Well, darling, I guess that's it.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.620
We'll have to leave here with exactly
that which we came here for.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.220
No, I already knew
Merlin was in the archive.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.230
I was looking for someone else.

20:38.330 --> 20:39.820
Who?

20:39.930 --> 20:41.160
You chose your words very carefully

20:41.270 --> 20:43.860
when you said
"the first human to set foot in the city."

20:43.970 --> 20:46.230
What about Ascended being?

20:51.740 --> 20:54.210
You're not really a hologram, are you?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.980
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

21:11.630 --> 21:12.660
I have it.

21:12.770 --> 21:15.330
It might require a little improvisation,
but I think, between the two of us,

21:15.430 --> 21:16.830
- we should be able to...
- What have you got?

21:16.940 --> 21:21.130
Our energy output problem isn't
one of degree, it is one of duration.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.370
We need to calibrate an explosion
with a low enough yield

21:23.480 --> 21:25.810
that the gate can survive,
but maintain sufficiently high energy

21:25.910 --> 21:28.280
for there to be a cumulative effect
on the matter stream.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.350
- You see, when I first realized...
- We use two bombs.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.440
McKAY: Yes, I was coming to that part.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.420
We set the second device to detonate
within a few seconds of the first.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.820
- I'm sure you've...
- Made the calculations.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.320
Yes, they're right here.

21:41.660 --> 21:46.120
- Nice job, McKay.
- Yes, well, it usually helps to threaten me.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.960
We only have four devices left.

21:49.070 --> 21:52.040
And we need two,
so let me just do the math...

21:52.140 --> 21:54.630
All right, so we only have
two more shots at this.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.000
I'm also concerned
that two successive blasts

21:57.110 --> 21:59.080
might overwhelm the stabilizer rockets,

21:59.180 --> 22:02.580
drive the gate closer to the event horizon
of the black hole.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.740
I'm not crazy about bringing
the <i>Odyssey</i> in that much closer.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.050
I think it's worth the risk.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.990
Do it up.

22:27.970 --> 22:28.940
What is it, Radek?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.340
Elizabeth, we've detected
a Wraith hive ship

22:30.440 --> 22:31.810
with our long-range sensors.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.710
Is it headed this way?

22:33.810 --> 22:35.750
Toward the <i>Odyssey.</i>

22:35.850 --> 22:38.110
- We should alert them. Open a channel.
- We can't.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.310
The black hole is blocking
their subspace communications.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.480
Well, <i>Odyssey's</i> sensors
will also be affected.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.150
Most likely,
along with several other systems.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.190
There's a possibility they won't see
the Wraith approaching them

22:46.290 --> 22:49.320
- until it's too late.
- That is my concern, yes.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.720
Dial Earth.

22:54.830 --> 22:57.860
It's quite possible the Wraith were drawn
to the nuclear blast.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.250
Stargate Command, this is Weir.

23:12.350 --> 23:16.850
Doctor! We weren't expecting to hear
from you until 1930 hours tomorrow.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.890
<i>WEIR ON RADIO: We've detected</i>
<i>a Wraith ship on our long-range sensors</i>

23:19.990 --> 23:23.220
<i>headed towards</i> Odyssey, <i>but they're</i>
<i>in close proximity to a black hole,</i>

23:23.330 --> 23:25.890
<i>- which has hampered communications.</i>
- How can we help?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.290
If you can get our message to Teal'c,

23:28.400 --> 23:31.340
he should be able to alert <i>Odyssey</i>
through the connected stargates.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.530
<i>We'll have to send a team with a subspace</i>
<i>transmitter closer to Teal'c's position.</i>

23:35.640 --> 23:38.340
Do what you have to do, Sergeant,
but they need to be warned.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.810
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- I'm forwarding you our message now.</i>

23:41.910 --> 23:45.750
There's still time to get it to them,
but you're going to have to hurry.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.180
Weir out.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.880
I'm going to check in on Dr. Jackson
and let him know what's happening here.

23:52.990 --> 23:53.980
Right.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.200
I know you're still here.
There's no point in hiding.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.700
I don't think she's coming back, Daniel,
especially if you shout at her.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.460
Oh, yes, she is. She's come this far.
She's going to finish what she started.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.230
You're not fooling anybody anymore!

24:09.280 --> 24:11.180
Dr. Jackson.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.370
Oh, hi.

24:12.910 --> 24:13.880
Hi.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.180
Who are you talking to?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.410
Well, I don't know
what she's calling herself these days,

24:18.520 --> 24:20.010
but at one point in history, her name was

24:20.120 --> 24:21.610
Morgan Le Fay!

24:22.690 --> 24:25.990
- Morgan Le Fay was here?
- Posing as a hologram, yes.

24:27.690 --> 24:30.390
- May I?
- Oh. Yes.

24:41.070 --> 24:43.740
<i>- Hello.</i>
- That's her.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.710
<i>You may enter your query verbally, or by...</i>

24:45.850 --> 24:48.640
You know, drop the schoolteacher act.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.310
This is a computer-generated image
of a Lantian woman

24:51.420 --> 24:52.820
who lived 10,000 years ago.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.820
I'm pretty familiar with the program.
It hasn't changed.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.660
Question.
Whose image is your avatar based on

24:59.760 --> 25:01.350
and what's the purpose of your program?

25:01.460 --> 25:03.950
<i>I was created by Ganos Lal, in her image,</i>

25:04.060 --> 25:07.360
<i>for the purpose of</i>
<i>assisting younger minds.</i>

25:07.470 --> 25:09.370
And what makes you think otherwise?

25:09.470 --> 25:11.960
For starters, she told us exactly
what we needed to know.

25:12.070 --> 25:13.400
She did?

25:13.510 --> 25:15.630
Does this interface have the capability
of playing back events

25:15.740 --> 25:17.710
- from earlier in the session?
- Yes.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.800
Can you play back the last sentence
she said to me before she disappeared?

25:30.260 --> 25:33.490
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

25:35.630 --> 25:37.820
See? See?
Her demeanor completely changed.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.870
She looked directly at Daniel.
It was really creepy.

25:41.570 --> 25:44.540
Well, I did warn you
that she could be patronizing.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.270
You said this device uses up
a lot of power.

25:47.370 --> 25:50.240
Is there any way of determining
exactly how much power we've used?

25:50.340 --> 25:52.140
Yes. Control Room, this is Weir.

25:52.240 --> 25:55.610
I need you to access the power usage logs
for the holo room.

25:55.710 --> 25:56.770
<i>TECHNICIAN: Yes, ma 'am.</i>

26:04.560 --> 26:05.620
<i>None.</i>

26:06.460 --> 26:07.430
None?

26:08.060 --> 26:09.050
Are you sure?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.300
Well, the lights are on. Other than that...

26:12.400 --> 26:13.390
Hey.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.520
(SNAPS FINGERS)

26:16.740 --> 26:18.000
Got you.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.630
I think I owe you an apology, Dr. Jackson.

26:23.580 --> 26:27.410
<i>There's no need, Dr. Weir.</i>
<i>I'm the one who should apologize.</i>

26:35.750 --> 26:38.380
<i>(ON RADIO) Teal'c, it's Mitchell.</i>
<i>We're going again.</i>

26:38.490 --> 26:41.250
<i>Looks like this is one of those days</i>
<i>when one nuke is not enough,</i>

26:41.360 --> 26:44.420
<i>so we're going to fire off two</i>
<i>in rapid succession.</i>

26:44.530 --> 26:46.090
Understood, Colonel Mitchell.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.670
Maintain a good, safe distance, Teal'c.

26:48.770 --> 26:51.000
There's a possibility
we could vaporize the gates on both ends,

26:51.100 --> 26:52.070
if we get this wrong.

26:52.170 --> 26:55.160
It's like five percent, maybe seven.
He'll be fine.

26:55.270 --> 26:57.770
That's a comfort, Rodney. Thank you.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.970
Coordinates are set.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.710
Beaming the warheads in five,

27:02.820 --> 27:07.150
four, three, two, one,

27:07.690 --> 27:08.650
mark.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.940
The second attempt
was also unsuccessful.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.870
However, energy did pass
between the stargate and the supergate.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.040
Close but not enough.

27:33.550 --> 27:36.380
<i>TEAL 'C: Indeed.</i>
McKAY: We still have two more bombs.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.140
I say we increase the yield to maximum
and try it again.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.910
You were the one who said a maximum
yield blast would vaporize both gates.

27:42.020 --> 27:45.220
We've only got one more shot at this.
What difference does it make?

27:45.320 --> 27:47.420
The man has a point, Sam.

27:47.530 --> 27:51.990
Each attempt is forcing the gate closer
to the event horizon of the black hole.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.330
To keep safe beaming distance,

27:53.430 --> 27:55.960
I'm going to have to bring
the <i>Odyssey</i> in even closer.

27:56.070 --> 27:57.470
And the closer you get to the black hole,

27:57.570 --> 27:59.470
the more systems are affected
by its effects.

27:59.570 --> 28:02.130
Sublight engines
and beaming technology are fine,

28:02.240 --> 28:06.510
but communications and sensors
are all out of whack already.

28:06.610 --> 28:10.100
- We're flying blind?
- Not quite, but close.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.580
(ALARM BEEPING)

28:16.590 --> 28:18.990
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Teal'c.

28:19.090 --> 28:22.490
My sensors indicate that an Ori vessel
is approaching these coordinates.

28:22.590 --> 28:25.460
At their current speed,
they will arrive within minutes.

28:25.560 --> 28:26.790
Is that enough time to try again?

28:26.900 --> 28:30.560
Not a chance. It takes time to set
and calibrate warheads and detonators.

28:30.670 --> 28:31.860
He needs to get out of there.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.170
- Can't do that.
- Well, why not? He's a sitting duck.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.540
What Colonel Mitchell is saying
is we can't allow the Ori

28:36.640 --> 28:38.610
to discover the secondary gate.

28:38.710 --> 28:41.650
If they do,
we'll never get another shot at this.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.920
- You're an ascended Ancient.
<i>- I am.</i>

28:53.030 --> 28:55.520
Specifically, Morgan Le Fay.

28:55.630 --> 28:58.620
I thought I recognized her from
descriptions in the archive on Vagonbrei.

28:58.730 --> 28:59.700
That's...

28:59.800 --> 29:01.130
That's great.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.500
So, enough of the tiny tidbits
of information.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.070
Not that we're ungrateful,

29:07.170 --> 29:09.040
but if you know
what it is we're looking for,

29:09.140 --> 29:13.240
and as an Ascended being,
I have to assume you do...

29:14.080 --> 29:18.350
<i>As Dr. Jackson knows,</i>
<i>it is against our highest law to interfere.</i>

29:18.450 --> 29:21.280
But interfering a little bit is fine, is it?

29:21.390 --> 29:24.220
It might be a good idea to be
a bit less confrontational.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.690
But she's here chatting with us.
That's interference, isn't it?

29:27.790 --> 29:28.990
If you really are Morgan Le Fay,

29:29.090 --> 29:31.290
how do I know
your intention is to help us?

29:31.800 --> 29:34.700
According to legend,
you were Merlin's greatest rival.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.170
Merlin is both Moros and Myrdin.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.970
<i>For a time in your history,</i>
<i>yes, I was his rival.</i>

29:42.070 --> 29:44.770
<i>But we're talking about</i>
<i>many thousands of years, Dr. Jackson.</i>

29:44.880 --> 29:47.780
<i>As you know, things change.</i>

29:49.010 --> 29:53.310
<i>When we first abandoned Atlantis</i>
<i>all those millennia ago,</i>

29:53.420 --> 29:57.650
<i>the Earth was so harsh,</i>
<i>its people so primitive by comparison,</i>

29:57.760 --> 30:01.190
<i>there was no hope of living among them</i>
<i>as Lantians or rebuilding our society,</i>

30:01.290 --> 30:05.250
<i>so instead we spread out to many lands,</i>

30:05.360 --> 30:09.930
<i>some of us planting a few small seeds of</i>
<i>civilization among the first tribes of man,</i>

30:10.040 --> 30:13.060
<i>others making their way to the stargate</i>
<i>at your southern pole,</i>

30:13.170 --> 30:17.670
<i>still others choosing to live the remainder</i>
<i>of our lives in seclusion and meditation.</i>

30:17.780 --> 30:20.340
<i>Merlin and I both chose the latter path.</i>

30:20.510 --> 30:22.040
And so you ascended.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.740
<i>It was only some thousands of years later,</i>

30:24.850 --> 30:28.080
<i>upon seeing the threat</i>
<i>the Ori could one day become,</i>

30:28.190 --> 30:32.450
<i>that Merlin retook his human form in order</i>
<i>to create the weapon that you seek.</i>

30:32.560 --> 30:35.030
<i>He did everything within his power</i>
<i>to keep his work secret,</i>

30:35.130 --> 30:37.490
<i>but we feared his intentions.</i>

30:37.600 --> 30:40.720
<i>I was sent to observe,</i>
<i>and, if necessary, to stop him.</i>

30:40.870 --> 30:43.270
Wait right there. Just a minute.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.390
If he was human again,

30:45.570 --> 30:48.770
then you were interfering.
You broke your own law.

30:49.410 --> 30:52.140
<i>Merlin retained all of the knowledge</i>
<i>he had gained when he ascended,</i>

30:52.240 --> 30:53.870
<i>as well as many powers.</i>

30:53.980 --> 30:55.810
<i>Knowledge and powers he used</i>
<i>to create a weapon</i>

30:55.910 --> 30:58.910
<i>capable of wiping Ascended beings</i>
<i>from existence.</i>

30:59.020 --> 31:00.750
So you're saying he cheated.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.320
<i>In a manner of speaking.</i>

31:04.560 --> 31:05.920
<i>For that brief time in your history,</i>

31:06.020 --> 31:09.320
<i>he was the most powerful being</i>
<i>on your planet.</i>

31:09.430 --> 31:13.300
<i>He created a small enclave of noblemen,</i>
<i>with whom he entrusted his secret.</i>

31:13.400 --> 31:14.830
Arthur and Camelot.

31:14.930 --> 31:16.090
<i>Yes.</i>

31:17.200 --> 31:19.230
So you're telling us that after doing
everything in your power

31:19.340 --> 31:20.860
to oppose Merlin,

31:21.110 --> 31:23.100
all of a sudden you agree with him?

31:24.680 --> 31:28.040
Because if you don't,
then you're deliberately misleading us.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.980
Teal'c, has the Ori ship detected
your presence?

31:35.990 --> 31:37.750
I cannot be certain.

31:39.090 --> 31:40.620
We have to risk it.

31:41.260 --> 31:44.960
<i>CARTER: Teal'c, I need you to get the ship</i>
<i>into position alongside the gate.</i>

31:45.060 --> 31:49.190
<i>From there, you should be able to extend</i>
<i>the cloak around the active stargate.</i>

32:00.180 --> 32:03.080
You realize the Ori ship could be there
to rendezvous with a new fleet of ships...

32:03.180 --> 32:06.210
Dr. McKay, why don't you go
calibrate your bombs?

32:06.320 --> 32:09.220
That way, you're ready
when the time arrives.

32:13.790 --> 32:15.890
Teal'c, the cloaking field
may be attenuated

32:15.990 --> 32:17.520
because you've expanded it.

32:17.630 --> 32:21.190
Shut down all non-mission-critical
systems and maintain radio silence.

32:28.810 --> 32:30.780
Hopefully they're there
just to check things out

32:30.940 --> 32:32.380
and they'll be gone soon.

32:36.820 --> 32:39.310
<i>I have no reason to deceive you.</i>

32:39.420 --> 32:41.910
No. Of course not.

32:42.020 --> 32:46.650
So, what were you doing when
you were pretending to be a hologram?

32:46.760 --> 32:49.960
<i>The learning program I created</i>
<i>many years before I left Atlantis</i>

32:50.060 --> 32:53.000
<i>presented itself as a means of helping you.</i>

32:53.100 --> 32:56.760
If you'd fallen for it, you'd have
your answers and be on your way,

32:56.870 --> 32:58.730
thinking you came up with it yourself.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.700
<i>That was my intention.</i>

33:04.340 --> 33:05.670
I believe you.

33:06.380 --> 33:07.350
I do.

33:08.050 --> 33:11.350
I mean, I understand the fine line
you have to walk,

33:11.450 --> 33:14.510
and I realize the risk you're taking
just showing yourself.

33:15.550 --> 33:18.020
But I'm sorry, I want more.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.780
And you can pass that on
to your friends as well.

33:19.890 --> 33:21.120
Yeah, I know you're listening.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.660
Because I am getting sick

33:22.760 --> 33:25.490
of hidden clues and cryptic messages.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.070
And Merlin was right
that the Ori are a threat,

33:29.570 --> 33:31.200
but not only to us lowers,

33:31.300 --> 33:34.430
not only to the billions of human lives
throughout this galaxy,

33:34.540 --> 33:37.200
but to your own existence,

33:37.310 --> 33:38.940
because when this war is over

33:39.380 --> 33:42.710
and every soul that's left alive
is praying to the Ori,

33:42.810 --> 33:45.910
feeding their need to be worshipped,

33:46.020 --> 33:48.510
well, you know
who they're going to come for next.

33:50.220 --> 33:51.950
I won't pretend to know
what that war will look like,

33:52.060 --> 33:54.360
or on what battlefield it will take place,

33:54.490 --> 33:56.930
but then I won't be alive to see it.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.620
<i>If we interfere,</i>
<i>we are no better than the Ori.</i>

34:02.730 --> 34:06.170
I understand that is at the very core
of what you are, of what you believe,

34:06.270 --> 34:08.740
but I'm talking about survival here.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.400
If you really are trying to help,
then help yourself.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.330
<i>(ON RADIO) This is SG-11 Comm Officer</i>

34:36.440 --> 34:39.500
<i>relaying an urgent message</i>
<i>via subspace relay from the Gamma Site.</i>

34:39.600 --> 34:42.070
<i>Message reads, "From Atlantis.</i>

<i>"Have detected Wraith ship approaching</i>

34:57.560 --> 34:58.890
<i>"Good luck."</i>

35:02.890 --> 35:04.660
Our last two bombs are ready to go.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.660
That's great. Pick a spot and relax.

35:06.770 --> 35:09.060
Colonel, sublight engines are
under a huge strain

35:09.170 --> 35:11.230
maintaining position this long.

35:19.110 --> 35:22.170
<i>You speak from the heart, Dr. Jackson.</i>

35:22.280 --> 35:26.580
<i>That is what I remember most</i>
<i>from your brief time among us.</i>

35:26.690 --> 35:27.810
<i>No, you wouldn't recall.</i>

35:27.920 --> 35:31.120
<i>Those memories were stripped from you</i>
<i>when you were sent back.</i>

35:31.220 --> 35:33.520
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

35:34.530 --> 35:37.890
Of doing the right thing
and being punished for it.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.230
<i>I've already gone too far.</i>

35:40.330 --> 35:44.530
But you can't be the only one to realize
the Ori have changed things.

35:44.640 --> 35:49.230
There must be others among you that see
that the time to join this fight is now.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.180
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Teal'c.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.950
Teal'c, what's the word?

36:08.060 --> 36:11.500
<i>TEAL 'C: A Wraith vessel is approaching</i>
<i>your position.</i>

36:11.600 --> 36:14.060
Oh, Wraith. That's not good.

36:14.630 --> 36:17.730
I'm sorry. How the hell do you know that?

36:21.210 --> 36:23.470
<i>Atlantis has detected their approach.</i>

36:23.980 --> 36:27.000
I am relaying their message
via Stargate Command.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.510
There's no sign of a Wraith ship
on the sensors.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.920
We can't trust sensors
this close to the black hole.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.250
Shields to maximum.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.830
Shields are only operating
at 20% efficiency.

36:41.930 --> 36:44.190
It's the black hole.
We need to get further away.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.590
Move us out.

36:55.810 --> 36:58.210
Well, there's something out there,
all right. We just can't see it.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.840
EMERSON: Damage report.
WOMAN: Hyperdrive is down.

37:02.010 --> 37:03.740
- Can we return fire?
- Trying, sir,

37:03.850 --> 37:06.180
but the Wraith ship is farther out
from the black hole than we are.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.770
Emergency thrust, sublight engines.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.510
Let's put some distance between us
and that thing.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.720
No. You know what?
We need to do the opposite.

37:12.820 --> 37:13.790
- What?
- What?

37:13.890 --> 37:17.260
Against a gravity well this strong,
they've literally got the higher ground.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.630
But if we can get them to follow us
closer to the black hole...

37:19.730 --> 37:21.290
Then their systems will be affected
the same way as ours,

37:21.400 --> 37:22.660
including their jamming technology.

37:22.770 --> 37:25.500
Which means we should be able to beam
the warheads directly aboard their ship.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.540
In that close, we won't have
the engine power to maneuver.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.470
So we slingshot, and use the gravity well
to accelerate back out.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.560
(EXPLOSION)

37:31.680 --> 37:33.080
Take us in. Full power.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.250
I know what we're asking you to do.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.450
You're afraid the others will step in and
stop you from helping us, but maybe...

37:50.930 --> 37:54.160
Maybe they just need someone
to cross that imaginary line

37:54.270 --> 37:56.460
instead of just walking it.

37:56.570 --> 38:00.330
There must be others among you
just waiting to follow your example.

38:01.940 --> 38:03.640
<i>Not enough.</i>

38:03.740 --> 38:06.340
But you have been allowed to go this far.

38:07.710 --> 38:11.380
<i>Trust that you have your answers.</i>

38:11.480 --> 38:15.110
At least tell us
which one of the planets to go to.

38:15.220 --> 38:16.620
Please.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.090
<i>Merlin's weapon is not...</i>

38:31.040 --> 38:32.900
What happened?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.170
Just what she knew would happen.
They stopped her.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.770
We won't see her again.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.140
Are they going to punish her?

38:44.050 --> 38:45.950
I don't know.

38:47.290 --> 38:50.250
I think I understand
why you came back, Daniel.

38:52.490 --> 38:55.150
I wouldn't have liked
their company, either.

39:04.370 --> 39:05.800
Shields are barely holding.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.460
- See it?
- Not yet, sir.

39:07.570 --> 39:09.630
- Maintain course.
- Teal'c, it's Sam.

39:09.740 --> 39:10.710
We're about to try something

39:10.810 --> 39:13.470
that will probably vaporize the stargate
at both ends.

39:14.380 --> 39:15.940
<i>CARTER: You've got exactly 20 seconds</i>

39:16.050 --> 39:18.610
<i>to get your hyperdrive online</i>
<i>and get out of there.</i>

40:05.160 --> 40:06.190
There it is!

40:07.170 --> 40:08.690
Wraith ship's in position.

40:08.800 --> 40:13.460
Beaming warheads
in three, two, one, mark.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.470
The Wraith ship has been destroyed.

40:48.570 --> 40:50.230
EMERSON: Reduce sublight engines
to one-third.

40:50.340 --> 40:51.740
Let's get hyperdrive back online.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.370
CARTER: There's something else.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.670
I don't know how it survived
the detonation, but...

40:55.780 --> 40:59.110
- The stargate. It's still intact.
- And it's still active.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.150
Odyssey, <i>this is Teal'c.</i>

41:01.950 --> 41:04.250
Teal'c, I thought we told you
to get the hell out of there.

41:06.020 --> 41:10.590
If I had done so, I would be unable to
inform you that the jump was successful.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.630
The supergate is now active.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.860
Are you serious?

41:15.970 --> 41:17.530
<i>There is more, Colonel Mitchell.</i>

41:17.640 --> 41:21.090
I was able to keep the stargate concealed
until the last moment,

41:21.210 --> 41:24.370
and lure the Ori vessel
into the unstable vortex of the supergate

41:24.480 --> 41:26.100
when the jump occurred.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.870
You mean we just blew up an Ori ship?

41:28.980 --> 41:31.680
By destroying a Wraith ship!

41:34.490 --> 41:36.550
Indeed we did.

41:36.650 --> 41:39.350
Today we have achieved a great victory.

41:48.870 --> 41:51.230
She did what she believed
was right, Daniel.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.830
How badly can she be punished for that?

41:54.570 --> 41:56.010
I don't know.

41:57.210 --> 42:00.580
Maybe she'll just get a slap on the wrist,

42:01.880 --> 42:03.970
or be forced to write,

42:04.080 --> 42:06.780
"I will not interfere in the affairs
of humans again"

42:07.020 --> 42:08.780
ten thousand times.

42:08.890 --> 42:10.790
Yeah, I doubt that.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.620
She said you had your answer.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.960
We found out the two addresses
we came here for.

42:19.060 --> 42:22.900
Can you at least smile about that?

42:25.670 --> 42:26.640
I suppose.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.940
But we did find out something else, too.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.070
What?

42:31.710 --> 42:33.340
They're not going to help us.

42:36.650 --> 42:38.510
We're in this alone.
