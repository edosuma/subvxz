01:28.714 --> 01:32.174
a president of our united States.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.648
And today...

01:47.733 --> 01:49.900
we celebrate their beginnings.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.321
I proudly give you...

01:53.405 --> 01:56.407
our graduating class.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.965
Kimberly... Oh, Jesus.
Kimberiy Ann... Bah!

02:47.042 --> 02:51.796
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

02:51.838 --> 02:56.467
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

02:56.551 --> 03:00.596
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

03:00.681 --> 03:05.851
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

03:05.894 --> 03:08.896
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

03:10.982 --> 03:14.235
Pee Wee! Pee Weei

03:14.277 --> 03:17.071
You're gonna be late
for school again.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.740
- Do you intend never to graduate?
- Mmm.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.666
Where'd you get it?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.459
My cousin at Southern
Methodist sent it to me.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.544
How long can we keep it?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.671
Long as we want.
He says we're sexually ignorant.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.132
- I guess we'll see.
- Yep.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.300
Hey, you guys!
Wait'll you see what we got!

03:38.343 --> 03:40.302
Hey, hold on. Pee Wee's
telling us about his dream.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.264
- So then she takes out this gazoombie.
- Gazoombie? What's that?

03:43.348 --> 03:46.475
You kn... You know.
Num-nums, choo-choos, tits!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.145
You know, she flashes everybody right
in the middle ofthe graduation ceremony.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.523
The biggest gazoombie I ever saw.
This girl was practically deformed.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.277
Then Carter steps on my gown, and the whole
graduating class is looking at my wiener.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.196
They'd need magnifying glasses
to see your wiener.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.197
It's more like a wienerette.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.199
Oh, yeah? When they saw it,
I got a standing ovation.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.118
They were standing
to get a better look.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.287
At least I had something
they wanted to see, Wendy.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.914
We've got something
you'll all want to see.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.915
A stag film.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.836
- A real stag film?
- You're too young, Pee Wee.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.838
- Your growth is stunted enough.
- Come on, Meat!

04:15.922 --> 04:18.382
- You gotta let me see it! You gotta!
- I don't know, Pee Wee.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.385
This has got more beaver in it
than the entire state of Wisconsin.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.721
They say you can go blind
from lookin' at stuff like that.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.807
No, the only way you'll go blind
is by lookin' at it like that.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.768
Yeah, well,
you got any better ideas?

04:28.852 --> 04:33.105
Well, I am the president
ofthe Audiovisual Club.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.087
Hey, guys,
what's he doin' to her now?

04:57.172 --> 04:59.548
Ah, looks like he's tryin'
to take her temperature.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.467
Yeah, without a thermometer?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.636
Oh, I'm sure he'll
think of something.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.763
Shit!

05:05.847 --> 05:07.765
Look familiar, guys?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.767
Yeah, looks like your entire arm.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.562
That's disgusting!
Hey, you're blockin' my view.

05:13.605 --> 05:18.567
Close the door, pecker-breath!
The light's comin' in!

05:25.951 --> 05:29.745
Decency demands that the culprit
be thrown out of school.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.581
These pupils don't
deserve to graduate.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.042
They're sick.
They're perverted.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.795
They're retarded.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.925
Mr. Carter! Mr. Carter,
I demand to know...

05:42.968 --> 05:46.011
what you intend to do
about this!

05:46.096 --> 05:48.889
- Mr. Carter!
- Huh?

05:48.974 --> 05:51.058
Oh. Oh, yes.
This is awful.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.018
Awful!

05:53.103 --> 05:55.855
Especially the woman
with the big ti... with the big ti...

05:55.897 --> 05:58.357
Gazoombies?

05:59.985 --> 06:03.571
I am ashamed at each
and every one of you.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.823
What have you got
to say for yourselves?

06:07.742 --> 06:11.704
Maybe you'd better explain to them
what will happen if the culprit...

06:11.746 --> 06:17.334
who's responsible for this schlock
film doesn't step forward.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.754
Yes. uh...

06:20.839 --> 06:23.549
- What will happen?
- Expulsion!

06:23.633 --> 06:25.718
- For all ofthem.
- Right, right.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.137
Who is responsible?

06:35.687 --> 06:37.605
uh, Mr. Carter...

06:37.689 --> 06:39.648
I brought it in.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.984
But I don't think the film
can be fairlyjudged...

06:42.027 --> 06:44.194
without viewing it in its entirety.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.156
How's that?

06:47.157 --> 06:50.117
uh, he means, it's true...
there is some nudity.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.412
- "Some nudity"?
- But I can assure you...

06:53.496 --> 06:56.040
before the principal
performers disrobed...

06:56.082 --> 06:58.667
- they were fully clothed.
- That's right.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.628
- It's art.
- It's filth.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.047
Disgusting, naked filth!

07:03.131 --> 07:07.259
uh, Miss Balbricker, if I may be so
bold, that's your characterization.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.763
They all had boners!

07:10.847 --> 07:14.224
Mr. Carter, I will not stand here
and be accused of having a boner.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.519
uh, this particularfilm
was, uh, directed...

07:17.604 --> 07:21.565
by the infamous... Sven.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.026
- Ah.
- Sven Svlinken from "Sveden. "

07:24.110 --> 07:29.740
- Oh! Svlinken from "Sveden. "
- It's trash! Garbage! Gunk!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.867
And we're late for class.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.955
Oh, yes. uh, yes. Good idea.
uh, go back to your classes.

07:37.248 --> 07:41.543
Except McCarty and Turner.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.923
- I haven't finished with you two yet.
- Good luck, guys.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.385
uh, when, uh...
When can we arrange a screening?

07:49.427 --> 07:53.097
uh, I'll have to check the schedule...

07:53.181 --> 07:56.350
because the projectors are sort
oftied up for the safety films.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.229
- uh, safety films?
- You know... uh...

08:28.049 --> 08:31.343
Come on, guys. Pick it up.
There's too much gloom around here.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.386
Are you kiddin'? They're kicking
our asses out there.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.390
Angel Beach hasn't been in the
state finals in over 20 years.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.143
Maybe it's 'cause your cheers are crummy.
Why don't you get new ones?

08:39.184 --> 08:42.980
- What's wrong with our cheers?
- Apparently, they're not working.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.149
If you really want to help us...

08:45.233 --> 08:47.317
why don't you throw a
victory party after the game?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.695
Okay. Ifyou win, you got it.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.365
And we're not talking about a milk
and cookies party. We want an orgy.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.036
- Orgy?
- Yeah, I think Tommy has a point here.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.330
That's what the Roman women did for
the gladiators after a big battle.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.458
They threw a victory orgy.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.501
- Forget it.
- No way!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.592
- What do you think?
- I'm with you.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.761
- I'm in.
- It's worth a shot.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.888
- The slumber party cheer.
- Change the words?

09:15.972 --> 09:19.141
- Let's do it.
- All right! Let's go!

09:19.184 --> 09:23.687
Not you. Go on! Go!

09:30.070 --> 09:33.947
Okay! Angel Beach,
strong and hardy!

09:34.032 --> 09:36.075
Win the game, have a party!

09:37.744 --> 09:41.371
We decided you were right! Put it
in the basket! fight, fight, fight!

09:41.456 --> 09:44.374
Roman women give in, in, in.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.628
use your balls and win, win, win!

10:11.444 --> 10:14.947
Wow! Go!

10:30.713 --> 10:33.799
The score is tied.
The game is tied at 70.

10:33.842 --> 10:38.303
Twenty-seven seconds left to decide
who goes to the state championship.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.133
Number four, Edward Morris...

11:16.176 --> 11:19.553
replacing Crutcher
forAngel Beach.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.192
Angel Beach!
Angel Beach! Angel Beach!

11:35.695 --> 11:38.030
Angel Beach wins!

11:38.072 --> 11:40.407
They're on the way to
the state championship.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.371
Whoo!

11:54.756 --> 11:56.673
- Meat! Meat!
- Yes.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.343
Did you see the girl in the fourth row?
Beautiful. Blonde all over.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.887
Oh, that's Inga. She's the Swedish
foreign exchange student.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.224
That's the girl in my dream!

12:05.266 --> 12:08.435
Buddy, your motor's running.
Why don't you save it for the orgy.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.520
Good game, Coach.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.525
What are you guys doing here?

12:15.610 --> 12:17.527
You shouldn't be on
school grounds.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.280
Yeah? What are you gonna do?
Give us detention?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.450
Look, I don't exactly have
all the money right now.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.410
I'll-I'll talk to Porky.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.788
I can get the rest ofthe money
in about a month or so.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.374
Now, look. You's the one
that come in to Porky's.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.377
You's the one that got drunk.
Now, we asked you not to gamble.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.504
I- I know. I got... carried away.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.006
You'll get carried away again...

12:38.049 --> 12:40.425
in pieces.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.521
You heard it all, huh?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.399
No, not a word.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.330
So, uh, when is this orgy
supposed to begin?

13:10.373 --> 13:12.291
As soon as my parents leave.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.335
Theyjust wanted to say hello.
They're not gonna stay very long.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.713
Neither are we.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.049
Well, I guess we gotta be going.

13:21.092 --> 13:24.219
That's too bad.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.638
Sorry. We gotta have dinner
with the Franklins.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.515
- Aw!
- Oh, well.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.726
Listen, if it's that important,
I mean...

13:33.438 --> 13:36.231
Have a great time!

13:38.401 --> 13:40.694
- Bye-bye.
- Drive fast.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.529
Have fun.

13:42.572 --> 13:46.616
Well, ladies, let's go.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.577
- Let's orgy!
- Let's get it on!

13:48.661 --> 13:51.038
- Hell, no. Let's get it off.
- Hold it!

13:51.122 --> 13:52.289
What? What's this?

13:52.290 --> 13:56.001
Now, you'll line up like
good little Roman soldiers.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.504
Pay attention.
Follow the rules.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.549
First, we all get undressed.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.181
- They're taking it off.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.600
We're gonna get laid!
We're gonna get laid!

14:11.642 --> 14:12.684
I hope you don't get scared.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.853
It's amazing what my fertile
mind can come up with.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.064
I can't believe they're
gonna go through with it.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.231
We're gonna get laid!

14:18.274 --> 14:21.151
Well, Billy, you'll finally
get to see your girl naked.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.944
- She's not bad, either.
- Oh, very funny.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.655
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on. In the pool!

14:25.740 --> 14:28.325
Last one in is the last one in.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.618
Roman soldiers in the deep end.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.623
Orgy time!

14:37.794 --> 14:39.711
This water's cold.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.801
Hey, where's Meat?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.012
Oh, sheesh!

15:05.488 --> 15:09.449
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.835
What's the matter with you?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.297
- Can't swim.
- Oh, great.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.014
Okay, soldiers. Get it off!

15:33.057 --> 15:35.642
- We're gonna get laid!
- We're gonna get laid!

15:42.066 --> 15:44.609
In the Roman army,
there were gladiators, slaves...

15:44.652 --> 15:47.487
horsemen and cannoneers.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.407
Cannoneer...
I'm definitely a cannoneer.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.285
- And Eunuchs.
- What's a Eunuch?

15:53.327 --> 15:56.788
- It's a guy with no balls.
- I'm a horseman!

15:56.831 --> 15:59.916
You start swimming toward us.
And make it graceful.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.461
Come to your ladies, heroes.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.380
Stay in formation.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.883
- What about your cannoneer?
- Graceful!

16:09.927 --> 16:13.263
I'm the cannoneer. What are you guys
gonna do, leave me here or what?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.400
Back to the deep end.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.366
Come get it, fellas.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.874
Okay. Who wants
to get dressed first?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.335
Come on. Come and get it.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.295
Here, boy.
Here, boy.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.964
Yoo-hoo!

16:48.090 --> 16:51.051
- What are you doing?
- We're going to make a movie.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.094
Ja, ja. A movie.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.765
Well, Meat, we're naked in a pool.
Would you please go get our clothes?

16:56.807 --> 16:59.434
No way. If they're making a movie,
I gotta be the main attraction.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.187
Meat's right. Pee Wee, you go.
You're the short subject.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.730
Ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha!

17:04.232 --> 17:06.358
I'm naked, treading
water in a pool.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.693
- You're making jokes.
- Jokes. Ja, ja.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.529
Ja, ja.

17:10.613 --> 17:14.074
- Go find a plug for the lights.
- Ja, ja. Plug.

17:14.157 --> 17:18.328
Okay, you guys. quit stalling.
Who's gonna be first?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.330
What the hell.
I always wanted to be a star.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.291
Oh, he's not gonna do it.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.836
He is gonna do it.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.132
Get a shot ofthis, babe.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.134
Well, girls,
how about that orgy, huh?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.679
It's not supposed to work like this.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.681
We're gonna get laid!

17:37.765 --> 17:39.724
Here comes your main attraction.

17:47.650 --> 17:51.278
Oh, no!

17:51.320 --> 17:53.530
Oh, we're not gonna get laid.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.991
Right!
We're not gonna get laid!

18:05.960 --> 18:08.920
We thought we'd come back
early tojoin the...

18:15.720 --> 18:19.848
uh, you came back a little late.
You missed a wonderful party.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.850
Yeah, it was
really a great spread.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.810
Your daughter Connie
really is lovely.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.770
I hope we can call on her again.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.147
Hey, we don't want to be rude,

18:27.148 --> 18:29.774
but we gotta get up early for
basketball practice tomorrow.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.527
- Well, hate to eat and run.
- You know what they say.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.946
- The early bird gets in the bush.
- Take it easy.

18:39.869 --> 18:40.952
You got my shoes up there?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.246
It was the most humiliating
experience of my life.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.291
I mean, it wasn't bad enough we're
running around the pool bare-assed...

18:46.334 --> 18:47.792
with our winkies
flopping in the breeze...

18:47.835 --> 18:48.835
You got a winkie, not me.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.755
You decide you're gonna go out
and greet her folks bare-ass naked.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.215
- Really good idea.
- I liked it. I don't care.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.844
Oh, I'm glad you guys liked it. You love
running around naked with your friends?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.305
- I'm watching the road.
- No, you're not watching the road!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.895
My mom's gonna kill
me when she finds out.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.229
Don't worry about it.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.566
- I don't think you're in my league.
- That's what's gonna happen.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.068
I'm gonna start hanging
out with myself.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.277
You hang out with yourself...

19:14.320 --> 19:16.237
a lot, by the looks of it.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.490
Hey, you know why you're pissed off?
You're pissed off...

19:18.532 --> 19:20.700
because you didn't
get to be a cannoneer.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.578
When we went there, you thought it
was gonna work. Everything was fine.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.375
You had your hand on my ass,
that's why.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.711
- I couldn't avoid it!
- Hey, slow down. There's Brian.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.506
Hey, Brian! Whoa!

19:37.468 --> 19:39.427
What the hell happened to you?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.138
Yeah, aren't you a little
bit late for the orgy?

19:42.139 --> 19:44.933
We've got something
important to do. Pick me up.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.102
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.355
Brian's burning oil.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.950
- So, how was your orgy?
- Why weren't you there?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.910
Yeah.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.912
uh-oh.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.997
What went wrong?
No orgy, huh?

20:08.082 --> 20:11.251
There was a tender moment
with Connie's parents.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.003
Oh, I see. Come on. Drive.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.840
- Where are we going?
- Porky's.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.800
Porky's? What are we
going to Porky's for?

20:18.843 --> 20:19.884
No! No way, Brian!

20:19.927 --> 20:22.721
- Look. Coach Good enough's in trouble.
- What are you talking about?

20:22.805 --> 20:25.724
The coach is a good guy.
He's helped us out a lot oftimes...

20:25.766 --> 20:27.684
and now I think it's our
turn let's help him out.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.353
Well, I agree with that,
but we go to Porky's...

20:30.438 --> 20:32.355
and then what do we do
when we get there?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.400
Easy. We shoot pictures
of his illegal gambling casino...

20:35.484 --> 20:37.402
and then we take them to the D.A.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.697
Oh, come on. Porky ain't
gonna let us anywhere near his place.

20:40.781 --> 20:41.781
Meat, ifyou remember,

20:41.824 --> 20:44.701
we didn't have a written invitation
the last time we called.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.558
- Great body.
- Look at that ass.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.311
- I could lick her waist.
- No, you don't lick a waist.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.646
That's not one of
the designated areas.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.698
- How you doing, babe?
- Hmm?

21:25.951 --> 21:28.536
Hey, Meat!
See you later.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.331
- Come on, man!
- Meat, give her a shot, huh?

21:32.833 --> 21:36.586
- uh...
- Hi. I'm Blossom.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.130
Why do they call you Meat?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.884
Why do they call you Blossom?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.923
- What happened?
- We happened.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.968
I guess he hasn't fixed it
up since our last visit.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.680
He must've. I mean, I heard
the coach say he was there.

23:01.255 --> 23:03.882
unbelievable.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.634
Son of a bitch got a boat.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.727
What do we do now?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.770
Let's go.

23:19.023 --> 23:22.317
- Where are we going?
- It's got to dock somewhere.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.319
Oh, yeah? What'll we do
when we get there?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.362
Let's just get there.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.490
unbelievable.

24:32.763 --> 24:36.391
Sam, you drink that damn stuff
faster than they can make it.

24:36.433 --> 24:42.063
Big boobs! Great broads.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.942
Mr. Johnson, sure am glad
you won all that money tonight.

24:46.026 --> 24:46.901
Thanks for the tip.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.737
Move your ass! Don't get
in the way of a high roller!

24:49.738 --> 24:53.199
I almost forgot what a mean
son of a bitch he is.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.576
Good night, Bob.
Come on back again.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.912
- Sure will.
- Take care.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.581
You get your ass inside.
I want to talk to you.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.803
Come on, knock it off. will ya?
Keep your hands off. Be a nice girl.

25:13.887 --> 25:18.349
Get away from...
Leave me alone, for God's sake.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.476
- You know, you guys are morons!
- Shh!

25:20.561 --> 25:22.478
- I don't want to shush.
- Keep it down.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.064
- Keep this down, huh?
- Look where you are.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.274
It wasjust a little joke.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.359
A little joke?
She practically raped me.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.361
She said she was gonna leave me
out there on the highway...

25:30.404 --> 25:34.115
unless I promised to show her
why they call me Meat.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.410
Are you still talking?
You think this is funny, right? Huh?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.662
You, come on.
Get out of my car.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.999
Guys, enough, enough. We still got
to find a way to get onto his boat.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.878
Hi, Daddy!

25:46.920 --> 25:50.214
Hi, baby. Blossom, you have
a good time tonight, child?

25:50.257 --> 25:53.384
Yes, I did, Daddy.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.137
Is that Porky's daughter?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.514
- That's it.
- What's it?

26:01.518 --> 26:05.104
- Meat, do you know how to use a camera?
- Forwhat?

26:05.189 --> 26:07.190
'Cause you gotta take this...

26:07.274 --> 26:11.736
and go with that girl into the casino
and take a few photos ofthe layout.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.030
uh, w-w-wait a minute.
She's gonna let me...

26:14.073 --> 26:16.866
go into her old man's illegal
casino to take pictures?

26:16.950 --> 26:21.496
- What are you, nuts?
- Well, you have to, um, distract her.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.917
Distract her with what?

26:25.959 --> 26:28.544
My friend, there comes a time
in every man's life...

26:28.629 --> 26:31.005
where he must rise
to the occasion.

26:31.048 --> 26:35.760
Oh, come on, man.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.929
Every time you guys get
a wild hair up your ass...

26:37.971 --> 26:39.514
I gotta go stick
my neck out, you know?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.725
Not my pants!

26:42.810 --> 26:45.895
Not my pants!

26:45.979 --> 26:48.064
Come on. Come on, please?
Not my pants.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.024
- Not my pants!
- Yes! Come on!

27:06.792 --> 27:09.544
I like a man who
plays hard to get.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.839
Will you stop it?
Not my pants!

27:12.881 --> 27:15.007
Huh? Come on!
Not my pants!

27:15.092 --> 27:18.719
Will you stop it? Please? Huh?
Come on, will you get off of me?

27:18.804 --> 27:22.098
- I want to ride you, jungle beast.
- Hey, come on. I...

27:22.141 --> 27:24.058
- Shit!
- Please! I ripped my shorts.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.060
- Shit!
- Come on! Leave me alone!

27:26.103 --> 27:28.354
Aah! Shit!

27:28.438 --> 27:30.398
Cut it out!

27:32.484 --> 27:33.484
Well, what's going on?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.653
Well, Meat's doing
pretty great up there.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.322
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he's doing terrific.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.324
Yeah, he's getting a lot of pictures.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.326
Okay, boys.
What the hell you doing here?

27:42.411 --> 27:45.621
This is private property.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.503
What the fuck you all
think you're doing?

27:52.546 --> 27:56.299
You was trespassin', boy.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.968
According to the law,
I could shoot...

28:00.304 --> 28:03.514
Great galloping gobs
of goat shit!

28:03.599 --> 28:06.726
You're the little bastards
that ruined my place.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.020
Well, I'm glad to see
you back, boys...

28:09.104 --> 28:11.189
'cause now I'm gonna
ruin you for good.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.899
Hey, wait a minute.
uh, look.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.901
You really don't want to do this.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.278
I don't, huh?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.614
Porky, do you really think
we came all this way...

28:19.698 --> 28:22.116
down here to see you without...
without a good reason?

28:22.159 --> 28:25.870
I mean, we knew we were risking our lives.
At least give us a chance to talk to you.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.206
You better talk fast, boy...

28:28.248 --> 28:31.500
'cause I've been wanting to find
you kids for one hell of a long time.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.921
Look, uh, do you think we
could go ashore and talk?

28:35.005 --> 28:37.215
This is kind of
complicated business.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.800
- Y-Yes. We'd like to talk business.
- Business.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.802
Business.

28:43.805 --> 28:44.805
Kill the little fuckers!

28:46.099 --> 28:48.768
Do the words "state championship"
mean anything to you?

28:48.810 --> 28:51.604
Yeah, it does.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.564
All right.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.691
Let's go into my bar.
Maybe we can talk some business.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.986
Get in there! Don't argue with me!

28:59.029 --> 29:01.989
Where are you?
What are you doing, huh?

29:02.032 --> 29:04.825
Where's my pants?
This ain't funny here.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.078
Where's my pants?

29:07.162 --> 29:10.039
- What the hell are you doing?
- Come here, big boy.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.709
Now, what is this bullshit
about the state championship, boy?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.671
Yeah, uh, state championship.
That's...

29:16.713 --> 29:19.048
That's what we were talking
about, wasn't it? uh...

29:20.259 --> 29:22.176
Tommy, why don't you
explain what we mean...

29:22.261 --> 29:26.055
when we say "state championship. "

29:26.139 --> 29:28.057
Right.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.351
uh...

29:30.435 --> 29:33.688
Billy, I think you're probably
better at this sort ofthing.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.108
uh-huh. No, thank you, sir.
I don't drink.

29:37.150 --> 29:41.195
Hey, I don't do business
with pussies. Drink up.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.031
- Drink! You.
- uh...

29:44.074 --> 29:45.992
You were saying?

29:46.076 --> 29:49.870
This ain't funny, man.
There's somebody downstairs.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.206
We got to get dressed
and get out of here.

29:52.291 --> 29:57.086
Come on, big boy. Ride me!
Yeah, come on. Ride me!

29:57.170 --> 30:00.006
Yes. Yes. Yes.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.341
Yes! Yes!

30:02.384 --> 30:05.720
You're gonna throw the state
championship? Bullshit!

30:05.762 --> 30:08.848
- Yes. Yes.
- You have our word on it.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.143
Yes. Yes.
Yes! Yes! Yes!

30:13.729 --> 30:18.232
We told Porky we'd throw
the game, right?

30:18.317 --> 30:23.487
So the coach is offthe hook,
and now it's our asses, right?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.365
I don't believe it.
Four years of practice.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.119
We finally get to the state
championship, and we've got to lose.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.122
Look, I mean, we at least got the
coach out oftrouble, right, guys?

30:33.206 --> 30:35.124
Yeah, and ourselves into it.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.501
Hey, what's life all about?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.879
Living.
It's definitely about living.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.340
Yeah? Well,
I ain't throwin' no game.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.636
- Hey, that's it!
- What?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.805
This is so simple.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.974
All we have to do
is win that game.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.769
- Win?
- Yeah. Sure. And then we're heroes.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.605
And nobody fucks with heroes.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.150
- He bought the funny farm.
- Wait a second. I like his idea.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.778
Look, ifwe hold
a press conference...

31:03.820 --> 31:05.905
afterwe win the game...

31:05.989 --> 31:08.282
and announce that certain
unscrupulous elements...

31:08.367 --> 31:10.493
wanted us to throw that game...

31:10.535 --> 31:12.661
nobody'll be able to touch us.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.789
We'll be a shining example...

31:14.873 --> 31:17.833
of good, clean, American youth.

31:17.918 --> 31:18.709
us?

31:18.752 --> 31:21.921
We believe in Mom, apple pie
and the American flag, right?

31:21.963 --> 31:23.297
Yeah.
People eat that stuff up.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.716
Including me. Especially the
part about winning games.

31:25.759 --> 31:29.845
- Well, Angel Beach Gators!
- Yeah!

31:29.971 --> 31:32.640
You may notice the pericardium...

31:32.682 --> 31:35.101
which is that little
sac around the heart.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.395
Once you find it, be...

31:41.149 --> 31:44.777
Mr. Tupperello, you haven't
made your dorsal incision.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.990
- I don't feel so hot.
- Make the incision.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.580
I can't.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.667
Here is your scalpel.
Now cut.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.090
Oh, God.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.190
You expect me to believe...

32:23.233 --> 32:25.526
that the captain
of a basketball team...

32:25.569 --> 32:27.820
would faint at the
sight of a mere frog?

32:27.904 --> 32:30.114
It wasn'tjust a frog.
It was a dead frog.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.283
She wanted me to cut the
thing open. She hates me.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.243
Miss Webster is one of the finest...

32:34.327 --> 32:36.412
most dedicated teachers
in this school.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.249
She wants you to get the best
education possible. Ifthat's possible.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.585
Even... now, get this,
Tupperello...

32:42.669 --> 32:46.922
Even if it means giving up
all extracurricular activities.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.468
I'll do anything,
as long as I can play basketball.

32:50.510 --> 32:54.638
I was talking about basketball!

32:56.600 --> 32:59.310
I can't give up playing.
We're going to the state championship.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.395
Fail your biology exam...

33:01.480 --> 33:05.274
and the team will have
to win without you.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.652
Miss Webster's recommended that you
not be allowed to play basketball...

33:08.695 --> 33:11.447
unless you get a passing
grade on her biology exam.

33:11.490 --> 33:16.994
And I'm backing her
up on that 100%!

33:17.078 --> 33:19.955
Get the hell out of here!

33:39.226 --> 33:41.185
I got it covered.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.653
Shit!

33:54.241 --> 33:56.700
- What's the problem, buddy?
- The door won't open.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.412
- Try the knob.
- Nice work. Come on.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.628
Okay. Spread out.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.339
Search the drawers
shelves, everywhere.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.264
Hey, Meat.
What's the exam look like?

34:19.349 --> 34:21.266
It's fury,
and it's got balls this big.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.268
What the hell do you think
a biology exam looks like?

34:23.311 --> 34:26.397
I didn't know. I'm not in your class.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.775
Hey, Meat. Human brain.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.735
You could use one, huh?

34:35.614 --> 34:39.534
Hey, Meat. You okay?

34:39.578 --> 34:41.911
Meat?

34:41.996 --> 34:45.123
Let's get him some air.
Over here.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.126
Geez!

34:50.255 --> 34:52.172
Are you okay?

34:52.257 --> 34:56.176
- Come on, Meat. Meat! It's just a brain.
- You're not helping.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.513
I can't find the
dang test anywhere.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.473
Maybe it's in her apartment.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.435
You crazy?

35:04.519 --> 35:07.313
We're gonna break in to
Miss Webster's apartment...

35:07.397 --> 35:09.857
and steal an exam?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.859
Think about this, Tommy.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.112
Ifwe get caught,
we could get sent to jail.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.031
Think about this.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.908
If Meat doesn't pass
that biology exam...

35:19.951 --> 35:22.786
we can kiss the state
championship good-bye.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.093
Shh!

35:46.728 --> 35:49.313
Whoa!

35:49.356 --> 35:51.857
- Not bad.
- Somejoint!

35:53.610 --> 35:56.612
Let's just hurry up, get the test,
get the hell out of here. Okay, guys?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.989
- Hey. Maybe you better check that desk.
- Yeah. Check the desk.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.283
Yeah, check the desk.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.582
Ah!

36:08.625 --> 36:11.752
Hey, guys.
Come here. Quick.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.962
What?

36:14.047 --> 36:16.465
You can see my grandmother's apartment
from here. She's dusting her furniture.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.384
Oh, this must be our lucky day.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.803
Maybe we can watch her
give her cat a flea bath.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.846
My grandmother
doesn't have a cat.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.224
But if she's in yourfamily,
I bet she has fleas.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.643
Will you guys cut it out?
We gotta get back to work.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.071
She's here! Shit!

36:39.155 --> 36:41.240
Shit!

36:45.453 --> 36:47.371
Shit!

36:47.455 --> 36:49.456
The lights!

36:55.380 --> 36:58.841
- That was a lovely dinner.
- Mmm. Great pasta.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.719
And the service
was extraordinary.

37:01.803 --> 37:06.849
- And the ambiance.
- Mmm, and the music. Oh, the music!

37:19.446 --> 37:21.488
You know,
that Anthony Tupperello...

37:21.531 --> 37:23.699
really is a dumb son of a bitch.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.285
He's gonna win the state
championship for us. We need him.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.121
Need? I don't need him
throwing frogs down my blouse.

37:29.164 --> 37:33.083
- Ah, he's just a kid.
- He's no kid.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.919
Okay, he's a dumb son of a bitch.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.471
What'll it be tonight, hmm?

37:45.555 --> 37:49.683
I could be the
Southern bartender.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.227
And you can be the impotent
alcoholic monk...

37:52.312 --> 37:53.979
thatjust escaped
from the monastery.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.939
Oh, goody!

37:56.024 --> 37:59.109
That's my favorite!

38:23.927 --> 38:26.386
What will it be...

38:26.471 --> 38:28.388
honey?

38:28.473 --> 38:32.184
Gosh, I don't know.
I'm-I'm not much of a drinker.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.646
You don't look like you're
much of anything to me.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.815
I know.
That's what they tell me...

38:37.899 --> 38:40.317
at the m-monastery.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.237
How about some Benedictine?

38:43.279 --> 38:46.490
S- Sure. You're the boss.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.452
Isn't that what they
drink at the monastery?

38:50.495 --> 38:52.162
On the... On the rocks.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.164
On the rocks.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.943
Oh, yeah!

39:29.033 --> 39:31.827
How come you left the monastery?

39:31.870 --> 39:34.872
I guess because I always wondered
what it would be like to...

39:34.956 --> 39:36.623
to...

39:36.708 --> 39:39.001
- to...
- Say it, big boy!

39:39.085 --> 39:42.546
To see a woman's breasts.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.726
- Cough!
- Aah!

40:46.611 --> 40:50.322
Now I know how she
affords this apartment.

40:50.365 --> 40:54.034
Come on.
Come on, big boy.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.662
Hyah!

40:56.704 --> 40:58.538
Hyah! Hyah!

41:01.376 --> 41:04.670
Well, if it's tits you want...

41:06.965 --> 41:08.882
take a look at these.

41:08.967 --> 41:13.553
Oh, my God.
Give me strength.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.889
Touch me, big boy.

41:15.932 --> 41:19.184
No, I can't. It's a sin.

41:19.185 --> 41:22.479
It's a sin.
I'd feel terribly ashamed.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.940
But you can't control yourself,
can you?

41:25.024 --> 41:27.317
I can! I... I have to!

41:27.360 --> 41:31.238
Then I'll take off everything
and make you beg.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.573
No, no!
Please... Please don't.

41:33.616 --> 41:38.662
- No! Don't!
- Come on, big boy. Beg.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.298
Come on! Beg!

41:50.341 --> 41:53.051
I ain't beggin'!

41:55.888 --> 41:58.682
You're... You're coming with me, bitch.

41:58.725 --> 42:02.310
- What about the monastery?
- Oh, I'll fuck the monastery!

42:35.178 --> 42:38.138
Oh, oh, Billy, when can
I view the Svlinken film?

42:38.222 --> 42:38.847
uh...

42:38.848 --> 42:41.308
Svlinken, the Swedish director.
Remember?

42:41.350 --> 42:43.935
- You said you'd arrange a screening.
- Oh, right. Yes. uh...

42:43.978 --> 42:45.896
You're really gonna
love it, sir.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.607
There's this man in
black socks and a mask.

42:48.691 --> 42:51.401
He represents the loneliness
ofthe Hungarian peasants.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.403
Oh, that's very interesting.

42:53.488 --> 42:57.365
I'll schedule the film just as soon as we
stop running those personal hygiene films.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.035
- Hygiene films?
- You know...

43:14.175 --> 43:15.509
Keep clean, Billy.
Yes.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.555
I couldn't believe it.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.933
I'm looking through this keyhole.
I have this incredible view, right?

43:22.975 --> 43:24.976
Guys, I'm telling you,
these two are hot.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.313
- They're really hot.
- Dobish and Miss Webster?

43:28.356 --> 43:29.106
Then what happened?

43:29.148 --> 43:31.691
I had to leave when they started
singing "Mack the Knife. "

43:31.734 --> 43:33.401
Pee Wee says Dobish
and Miss Webster

43:33.444 --> 43:35.570
are going at it again in
her apartment tonight.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.614
- So?
- So?

43:37.698 --> 43:41.993
We might be able to get some photographs
ofthem. Perfect blackmail material.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.329
Forget it. We blew it last time
with your stupid camera.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.498
Look. I'll take the
photographs this time.

43:46.541 --> 43:49.084
I'll even rent a better camera
with some telephoto lenses.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.920
How do we get the shots?

43:51.963 --> 43:54.756
Easy. Pee Wee's grandmother
lives right across the street.

43:54.841 --> 43:58.593
Whoa, whoa. Time out. Come on.
Let's leave my grandmother out ofthis.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.554
Pee Wee...

44:00.596 --> 44:03.056
if you let us use your
grandmother's apartment...

44:03.099 --> 44:05.016
I'll give you your own private...

44:05.101 --> 44:08.520
personal collection of photographs
of Dobish and Miss Webster...

44:08.563 --> 44:10.772
including "Mack the Knife. "

44:10.857 --> 44:12.899
So what time do I tell
her to expect us?

44:13.901 --> 44:16.444
I can't wait to share
this recipe with my mother.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.655
I wish I had a grandmother
just like you.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.699
Thank you, boys.
Thank you.

44:20.783 --> 44:23.785
- I sure do appreciate your help.
- Oh, it's our pleasure, Grandma.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.829
To be in the company
of such a gracious...

44:25.872 --> 44:27.789
charming,
attractive woman is a joy.

44:27.874 --> 44:29.916
Yes, and to allow us
into your kitchen...

44:30.001 --> 44:33.503
and teach us all your
great culinary secrets...

44:33.588 --> 44:37.215
My husband, Fat Harry...
may he rest in peace...

44:37.258 --> 44:40.385
always used to tell me,
"never shit a shitter. "

44:40.428 --> 44:43.471
Here's his teeth. You know,
he was such a great eater.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.102
Pee Wee, you got a great grandma.
Isn't she great?

44:49.145 --> 44:54.566
- One of a kind.
- Yeah. Made her and threw away the mold.

44:54.650 --> 44:58.403
Oh, Edward, where did you
ever find these slick boys?

44:58.446 --> 44:59.696
Did you just meet 'em?

44:59.739 --> 45:02.824
No, Grandma. We've been
friends for a long time.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.368
Well, how come you never
told me about 'em?

45:05.411 --> 45:07.412
Well, I-I've been busy.

45:08.998 --> 45:13.043
Never say you're too busy
to visit your grandmother.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.378
Now, eat your soup.

45:15.463 --> 45:18.131
I already broke the
bread for you.

45:21.010 --> 45:23.053
You sure you know how
to work these things?

45:23.095 --> 45:23.595
Yeah.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.805
You know,
they're pretty complicated.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.808
So simple,
a child could use 'em.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.102
I don't mean that as
an insult, Meat.

45:31.187 --> 45:33.480
Say anything you want.
Just take the pictures, huh?

45:33.481 --> 45:34.064
Okay.

45:34.065 --> 45:37.525
Tell me again about that boy
at the window with the camera.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.445
uh, you see,
he's studying photography...

45:40.488 --> 45:43.657
and he needs these pictures
for his term paper.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.867
And it's only from my window...

45:45.910 --> 45:47.827
that he should get such pictures?

45:47.912 --> 45:51.706
- You have a great view.
- The perfect angle.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.678
Hey, could you excuse
us a second, Grandma?

46:04.720 --> 46:05.887
We'll be right back.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.312
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.481
He's always hungry, Grandma.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.483
- Want to eat?
- Yeah.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.819
Who?

46:20.861 --> 46:23.947
That's funny, buddy.
Yeah, Grandma's funny.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.368
We just hit pay dirt.

46:31.289 --> 46:34.582
- Whoa! look at that!
- You getting it?

46:34.667 --> 46:36.960
- I'm getting it all.
- "Mack the Knife"?

46:37.003 --> 46:41.256
Got a chain.
Cat-o'- nine-tails.

46:41.299 --> 46:44.426
What are they doin'?

46:44.510 --> 46:47.637
Whippin' up Meat a
4.0 grade average.

47:23.215 --> 47:26.509
Hey, here's a picture of
my mom in the drama club.

47:26.552 --> 47:29.429
They sure dressed funny then,
didn't they?

47:29.513 --> 47:32.140
There's Balbricker.

47:32.183 --> 47:35.268
Look.
"Beulah Balbricker. "

47:35.311 --> 47:40.565
Says, uh,"debating team,
arts and crafts and wrestling. "

47:40.608 --> 47:43.902
"Bubbles may be the captain
ofthe girls' wrestling team...

47:43.986 --> 47:48.823
but Snooky Kelton is the one she'd
most like tumbling around with. "

47:48.908 --> 47:51.326
They called Balbricker "Bubbles"?

47:51.369 --> 47:54.537
Let's see what old
Snooky looks like.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.624
Here he is.
Sam "Snooky" Kelton.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.668
You know, I wonder
what would happen...

48:00.711 --> 48:03.338
ifwe got old Bubbles and
Snooky back together again.

48:03.381 --> 48:07.342
You just gave me
a wonderful idea.

48:07.385 --> 48:10.387
- You guys hungry?
- Yeah, let's hit Deadbeats.

48:14.975 --> 48:18.353
My dearest...

48:18.396 --> 48:20.939
darling...

48:21.023 --> 48:23.566
Bubbles.

48:25.194 --> 48:29.072
It's been so long
since I've felt your...

48:31.409 --> 48:33.326
grip.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.413
Ooh!

49:15.995 --> 49:19.831
Hey, you little devil.
You latched on to that Inga, huh?

49:19.915 --> 49:22.917
Told you it's not the size of the dog;
it's how hard he bites.

49:23.043 --> 49:25.003
Tommy, you're not gonna
believe this. It's great Pee Wee.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.921
It's incredible!
I can't believe it!

49:27.047 --> 49:29.466
Look. She's meeting me in a
motel room. I can't believe it.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.259
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.678
The girl must recognize
that I'm in my prime.

49:33.762 --> 49:36.347
You know, she's Swedish.
They have knowledge.

49:36.390 --> 49:40.977
This says she's gonna meet you
in the Moonbeam Motel, room 48?

49:41.061 --> 49:44.105
"Naked and ready"?
Oh. Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

49:44.148 --> 49:48.693
- Naked and ready.
- Geez.

49:50.196 --> 49:52.947
What, you gonna go
dressed like that?

49:53.032 --> 49:56.117
- Yeah, what's wrong with the way I look?
- For Inga?

49:56.160 --> 49:58.870
From a foreign county with
the great gazoombies?

49:58.913 --> 50:02.290
Tsk. Your old man got a tux?

50:02.374 --> 50:04.292
Tuxe... Oh, yeah. Why?

50:04.376 --> 50:06.294
Why don't...
Why don't you get it?

50:06.378 --> 50:09.172
You show up, all
distinguished... a tuxedo...

50:09.256 --> 50:11.216
a nice, big bow tie.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.636
- She'll like it.
- Thanks, Tommy.

50:14.678 --> 50:18.097
No. Don't take flowers and candy.
Show up like a man.

50:18.182 --> 50:21.309
- A man. Thanks, Tommy.
- Yeah.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.611
- Oh, great.
- Lucky us.

50:31.695 --> 50:34.322
- Hello, boys.
- What's goin' on, ladies?

50:34.365 --> 50:37.200
How about old Balbricker
in the raw...

50:37.284 --> 50:40.203
in a motel room waiting
for her true love?

50:40.246 --> 50:42.539
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

50:42.623 --> 50:45.708
Balbricker sent this reply
to the post office box...

50:45.751 --> 50:48.086
I assigned to Snooky Kelton.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.088
She wrote: "Dear Snooky. "

50:50.172 --> 50:52.674
"After all these years and
after all that's happened...

50:52.716 --> 50:55.134
"it was wonderful
hearing from you again.

50:55.219 --> 50:59.347
"I would love to see you
whenever and wherever you want.

50:59.431 --> 51:02.016
"Just name the time
and the place.

51:02.142 --> 51:05.562
Impatiently yours, Bubbles. "

51:05.604 --> 51:07.855
I named the time and the place.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.816
She's gonna show up?

51:09.900 --> 51:13.653
The Moonbeam Motel,
right about now.

51:13.696 --> 51:16.239
- But not with Snooky.
- Who with?

51:16.323 --> 51:20.285
Pee Wee.

51:39.888 --> 51:42.932
All right. Let's keep
it down. Here he comes.

51:53.902 --> 51:55.820
Come in.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.953
Oh!

52:07.583 --> 52:10.585
- Is that you, darling?
- uh-huh.

52:30.272 --> 52:33.566
Hurry! Hurry, please!

52:33.609 --> 52:35.860
Please? Oh!

52:35.944 --> 52:40.239
Oh! Oh! Flowers.

52:40.324 --> 52:42.825
I love this!

52:46.455 --> 52:49.874
- Wish we had a program.
- Hey, here come the girls.

52:53.420 --> 52:55.546
- Everything okay so far?
- Yep.

52:55.589 --> 52:57.590
Great.

52:58.926 --> 53:03.680
Oh, candy!
It tastes so good!

53:03.722 --> 53:06.015
Ah! Hurry.

53:07.142 --> 53:11.270
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

53:20.280 --> 53:22.281
Yeah. Yeah!

53:22.366 --> 53:25.326
What the hell is this?

53:26.995 --> 53:28.913
It's Pee Wee.

53:28.997 --> 53:32.083
I don't get it.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.043
Hi, guys.
uh, what's goin' on?

53:34.128 --> 53:35.169
What are you doin' here?

53:35.170 --> 53:37.505
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

53:37.548 --> 53:39.465
You're supposed to be
in there with Balbricker.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.467
Balbricker?

53:41.552 --> 53:44.011
Well, Jesus, Pee Wee, ifyou're
not in there, who the hell is?

53:48.559 --> 53:51.060
Tommy Turner.

53:55.232 --> 53:57.775
What, do you think I was
made with a finger?

54:00.320 --> 54:02.822
Where's the camera
when we need it?

54:19.506 --> 54:21.883
Oh, Inga!

54:21.925 --> 54:24.010
Snooky?

54:26.388 --> 54:30.099
- "Snooky"?
- "Inga"?

54:41.487 --> 54:43.613
Shit. Shit!

54:43.697 --> 54:45.990
I'm gonna... Get off!

55:10.933 --> 55:14.936
I've got you now, you freak!

55:15.020 --> 55:19.398
You juvenile obscenity!
I've got you now, Tommy Turner!

55:19.441 --> 55:21.567
You poor excuse for humanity!

55:21.652 --> 55:25.363
Beulah!

55:27.074 --> 55:31.702
Introducing the
Angel Beach Gators!

55:35.874 --> 55:40.628
Welcome to the state
championship game.

55:48.053 --> 55:51.389
Now taking the floor,
the Harmon Hornets!

55:51.473 --> 55:54.559
I'm gonna break his
fuckin' finger off.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.978
Just be happy you're
in the game at all.

55:57.062 --> 56:00.022
Well, turns out we didn't need those
photographs of Miss Webster after all.

56:00.065 --> 56:03.276
Wendy tutored me,
and I'm pretty sure I passed.

56:03.318 --> 56:05.611
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What are you talkin' about?

56:05.696 --> 56:08.281
I told Billy. He said that he
was gonna leave the photographs.

56:08.323 --> 56:11.826
No. No, I left them right
on Miss Webster's desk.

56:21.253 --> 56:23.212
Shoot.

56:29.428 --> 56:32.722
- Busy hands are happy hands!
- Cut it out!

56:32.806 --> 56:35.725
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter? Huh?

56:35.809 --> 56:38.436
- He's got a lot of right answers.
- Well, that's good.

56:38.478 --> 56:40.605
Not as far as I'm concerned.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.149
I'm gonna make sure that
that Anthony Tupperello

56:43.191 --> 56:45.109
doesn't play in that
basketball game.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.696
Why didn't you tell me
the final game is tonight?

56:48.739 --> 56:51.198
Everybody knows it's tonight.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.910
It's for the state championship.

56:53.994 --> 56:57.330
Well, if it's such an important
event, why aren't we going?

56:57.414 --> 56:59.624
I promised I'd take
Sharon and the kids.

56:59.666 --> 57:02.376
You're taking yourwife
to a school function?

57:02.461 --> 57:04.879
- Darling, it'sjust for tonight.
- Don't you "darling" me...

57:04.880 --> 57:06.839
you two-timing pervert!

57:06.924 --> 57:09.759
- Get out! Out! Out!
- Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

57:09.843 --> 57:13.179
I never want to see you again.
Freak! Out! Out!

57:23.023 --> 57:24.982
Howdy, Coach.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.984
What are you doin' here?

57:27.069 --> 57:28.986
I- I don't have the money yet.

57:29.071 --> 57:31.906
Hey, don't worry about a thing.
That's already been taken care of.

57:31.949 --> 57:35.409
I got a bundle riding on this game
tonight. You understand me?

57:35.494 --> 57:39.413
I hope you bet on Angel Beach.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.540
You're a very funny man, Coach.

57:41.583 --> 57:42.583
Very funny man.

57:45.420 --> 57:47.630
The teams are returning
to the dressing rooms...

57:47.714 --> 57:50.174
for last-minute instructions.

57:57.683 --> 58:01.018
Tonight you have the
chance to be champions.

58:01.103 --> 58:04.146
And if you do that, I'm the
coach that got you there...

58:04.189 --> 58:06.107
and that's what my
life is about.

58:06.191 --> 58:09.151
Now, I want you to go out there...

58:09.236 --> 58:12.571
and win.

58:13.865 --> 58:16.450
Locker room.

58:16.535 --> 58:18.536
Coach?

58:21.873 --> 58:25.793
Coach Good enough. Oh, Miss
Webster. What can I do for you?

58:30.340 --> 58:33.342
Hold it, Meat.

58:33.427 --> 58:35.803
- I can't let you play.
- Why not?

58:35.846 --> 58:38.389
That was Miss Webster.
You failed your biology exam.

58:38.473 --> 58:41.350
Aw, come on, Coach.
That's impossible! I know I passed!

58:41.435 --> 58:43.644
Come on, you guys. Quit stalling.
Get out there and play.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.354
Coach, there's no way
we can win without Meat.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.439
Who's gonna play for Meat?

58:46.481 --> 58:49.483
Quit stallin'.
You guys got a game to win.

59:33.653 --> 59:37.573
Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

59:37.616 --> 59:41.535
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!

59:42.871 --> 59:45.164
Your daddy's gonna win
a bundle on this one.

59:45.207 --> 59:47.124
You having a good time?

59:47.209 --> 59:49.543
I'd have a better time
if my Meat was playing.

59:49.628 --> 59:52.421
- Say what?
- Nothing.

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.205
Halftime buzzer!

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.666
The score:
the Harmon Hornets, 39;

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.460
Angel Beach Gators, 19.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.107
I thought I told you to get out!

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.110
Ifwe don't do something
about these, we'll both be out.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.490
I know they're bigger and stronger...

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.493
but ifwe don't start crashing
the boards in the second half...

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:08.539
the score ofthis game is gonna wind up in
the Guinness Book of Embarrassing Records.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.792
Locker room.
Coach?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.506
Coach Good enough.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.175
And upon closer scrutiny,

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.179
I discovered that Mr. Tupperello
has passed his biology exam.

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.891
So should you decide
that his participation...

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:30.186
would enhance your chances at
the basketball championship,

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.770
please feel free to use him.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.685
Meat! Keep scoring!

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.554
Bastards! Damn bastards!

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.692
Edward Morris, the
last available substitute...

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.986
reporting to the scorer's bench.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:58.977
Sons of bitches. Those dirty,
little rat-fucking bastards!

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:03.649
They double-crossed me again.
Now someone's gonna pay for this shit!

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.068
What the hell are you
so happy about?

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.029
- Meat won the game for me.
- Who did what for you?

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:12.616
Meat. Meat Tupperello.
He's my boyfriend.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.244
You know that boy?

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:18.705
- We went all the way.
- You what?

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.083
We went all the way.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:24.211
- Shit.
- You want him dead orjust crippled?

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:28.549
I want that bastard married to her.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.636
"And then with two seconds left...

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.515
"a reserve guard with nerves
of steel came to the fore.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:40.936
"Edward 'Pee Wee' Morris took
the last shot to win the game...

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:45.607
proving that this young man
has ice water running in his veins. "

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.192
Pee Wee's gonna love that.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.070
Come to think of it,
where the hell is he?

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.281
Guys!

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.324
- What's with him?
- How do I look?

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.869
- You look like you ate a rug.
- Oh, yeah?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.704
Well, when Porky comes
looking for you guys,

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.706
remember who was smart
enough to wear a disguise.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.375
He's not gonna come looking for us.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.209
uh-uh.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:07.171
Yeah, you made the winning shot.
It says so right here in the paper.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.841
Oh, shit! It was luck I tell ya.
It was just luck.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:15.095
The ball landed in my hands. I just threw
it so those Harmon guys wouldn't kill me.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.556
I didn't even know where
the basket was. I swear.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.019
Hi, guys.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.855
- Hi.
- Did you see who's on the beach?

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:29.234
Balbricker.
She's been there all morning.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.322
God, I feel awful.

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:35.741
- Why?
- Look what we did to her.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.912
We built up her hopes to see somebody
she's been crazy about all these years...

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:43.081
and then we zapped her
with a sick practical joke.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.209
What do you mean "we"?

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:49.796
All right, I started it.
It's my fault. I feel terrible.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.966
How do you think I feel?
I was in bed with her.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:56.136
Boy, she looks in pretty bad shape.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.138
Well, there's nothin'
we can do about it now.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:02.309
Yes, there is.
We can find Snooky Kelton.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.728
What are you, nuts?
How are we gonna find him?

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.940
Yeah, he could be dead
already for all we know.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:12.152
He's alive and living in Miami,
and we can be there by this afternoon.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.268
This is pure filth.
Pornographic filth.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:54.815
I sat through every disgusting
frame ofthis film...

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.776
twice.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.821
And as a result...

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.824
I am physically ill.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:09.454
Mr. Carter, art is a
very subjective phenomenon.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:13.667
Can it, McCarty. You're not gonna
pull the wool over my eyes again.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:17.671
Now I have no choice but to...

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.980
Good morning, everybody.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:40.485
Oh, no, no, no. You're not
late at all, Miss Balbricker.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.615
About the film... Now you...
you were perfectly right.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:49.703
It is the worst piece of pornographic
trash that I have ever seen.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:53.206
It's raunchy, degrading,
beneath the human dignity.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:57.335
Oh, come on, Harold.
Don't be such a tight-ass.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.796
Ah, I-I beg your par...

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.300
He was wrong,
and he's sorry, aren't you?

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.928
Aren't you?

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.306
uh-huh.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.808
All right.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.978
Snooky...

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.230
Snooky...

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.233
Snooky...

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.277
Snooky.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:26.114
Mr. Kelton, an old friend...

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:30.744
and former alumnus
ofAngel Beach High...

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:36.166
has generously offered
to donate his beautiful home...

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:40.670
and host the party for
this year's senior prom.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.131
That's great.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.926
But what about the Svlinken film?

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.887
Well, I, uh, guess
I'd better be going now...

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.181
and let the seniors
know the good news.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:55.060
Thank you both so much. It-It's really
gonna mean a lot to everybody.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.270
It means a lot to me.
uh...

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:01.233
Wow. Gosh.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.568
Gee.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.570
Zowie!

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.635
Snooky, I'd like you
to meet Edward Morris.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:29.261
Hi.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:30.011
How are you?

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.931
uh, Edward, have you met
our exchange student, Inga?

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.392
- Ja.
- Hey, guys! Come on, move it!

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:39.521
Oh, look at the nice people.
Isn't she pretty? Huh?

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:55.245
Looks like Goose is airing out
his Chevy again. We'd better walk.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:01.084
Come on, buddy. Leave it there, Meat.
We're gonna walk in.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.086
Shall we?

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:10.135
So it's really a drag, man.
We come all the way down here...

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.888
I win the state championships,
I bring the car here...

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.098
I put on this monkey suit,
and now I gotta walk there.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.809
It's really garbage, man.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.854
Get his legs.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:24.232
Stop!

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:33.325
Now, I want you to tell those double
crossin', rat-faced basketball pricks...

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.286
that Porky finally
got his revenge!

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:41.124
Mr. Meat Tupperello
will be at no graduation!

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:45.170
He's signing on board the H.M.S. Pignuts
with me for an indefinite cruise.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.672
- Do you understand me?
- That's kidnapping!

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.842
It's not kidnapping when he's
gonna be my son-in-law, girl!

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.261
And that he's gonna be!

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:16.284
We gotta get him. We gotta
get that fat son of a bitch.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.752
Okay.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.796
Okay.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.256
Good luck.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.217
Yep.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:58.159
This is the most important
day of my life, you understand?

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.787
It's not every day that
my Blossom gets married...

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.331
and I don't want
nobody fucking it up!

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.792
- You get that?
- I got it, Porky.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:09.587
All you gotta do, girl, is come down
the aisle with him and give him away.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.924
- And don't fuck it up!
- I won't fuck it up.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.760
I'm gonna come down the aisle,
and I'm gonna give Meat away.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.805
All right. You got it. Now get
your ass back to work. Go on.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:22.100
What's the matter with you?
Can't you smile, boy? Huh?

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.811
- Daddy, I'm sorry to interrupt you...
- What are you doin' here?

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:25.895
There's a hooker, and she...

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.356
Don't you know it's bad luck
for the groom to see the bride?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.151
- Get your ass back in your cabin!
- Come on, man. Lay off!

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:36.508
Come on. Give me
your hand, Meat. Come on.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:38.676
Get up here.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.762
Goddamn it.

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:46.101
Here. You gotta forgive me
for my temper, Meat.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:49.562
But I'm glad to see my
son-in-law is a moxie guy...

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:52.357
'cause that's exactly what
I want from my grandson.

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:55.527
- What grandson?
- The one from you and Blossom, asshole!

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:59.197
Now, what the hell you think
you're gettin' married for, boy?

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.573
Beats the shit outta me.

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:03.201
You know, I hope we
don't have to do that.

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:07.122
Aw, shit.
Those days are over.

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:10.583
Man, all I want now
is a young grandchild.

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:12.752
A little Porky. Somebody
to bounce on my knee.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:16.965
Teach him how to hustle, beat people,
go fishin', break heads, kick ass.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:19.801
Somethin' to be proud of.
Carry on the family name.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.529
What in the hell are you cryin' for?

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.489
You look so beautiful.

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:27.243
You're supposed to
cry at weddings.

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:30.330
Not at my wedding.
I want happiness.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:33.166
Smile.
This is a pleasure boat.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:38.129
Thank you, Daddy.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:59.025
Dearly beloved...

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:03.196
we are gathered here today
to join this man...

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:07.242
and this woman in the bonds
of holy matrimony.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:11.788
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer...

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.291
in sickness and in
health till death...

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:18.461
Holy Moly!

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.880
Good God!
What's happening to this place?

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.299
Give me my lights!
Where's my lights?

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:34.060
- It's us! It's us!
- Listen, man. Thank God, man.

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:37.897
I mean, I really want to thank you guys for
saving me from the old ball and chain.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.941
Tell us about it later.
Let's get outta here.

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.567
All right, all
right, all right.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:49.033
uh, how do we, uh...
How do we, uh, get outta here?

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.626
He can't swim.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:10.054
Gus! Freddie! You up here?
Where the hell are you when I need you?

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:13.474
Lenny!

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.435
Where the hell you guys been?

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:18.187
- In the dark. The lights went out.
- No foolin'.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.982
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.443
- Like raising the Titanic.
- Goddamn it. Hey!

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.779
Come on!

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.450
I know you're out there,
you little bastards...

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.492
and I'm gonna find you!

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:37.290
There you are, you candy asses!

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.876
Hey, ugly! Hey, pig man!

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.545
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna chew up your asses!

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:46.507
Sooie! Soo! Soo! Sooie!

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.926
- What are you doing?
- I'm antagonizing him.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.887
Will you get the motor started,
for Christ's sake!

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:51.387
Sooie!

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.514
- He's comin' after us.
- That's exactly what we want.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:55.933
- Come on, fatty!
- Get 'em with the paddle wheel!

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:27.048
Come on, Porky! Sooie!

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.592
Hey, piggy!
Bet you can't catch us!

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:33.304
- You tub of shit!
- Give me full speed!

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:39.727
- Start the motor!
- Okay.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:43.022
- Burn it!
- I can't!

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:47.652
- What are we doin'?
- Come on! Row!

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:50.196
- Full speed! More power!
- Row!

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:56.285
- Full speed!
- Faster!

01:21:56.328 --> 01:22:00.206
- Come on!
- More power! Power, I said!

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:14.554
Hey, get the troopers! Get the
Marine Patrol! I got another suicide!

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:24.856
Come on!

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.151
Come on!

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.911
Lady, please don'tjump!

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:41.789
I have to.
I have to be with him.

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:46.836
Him? Him?
He's gone.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:51.883
Yep. Real gone.
He's a real gone guy.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:54.510
- More choke!
- Come on!

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.477
Fuck you, fat man!

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:05.521
Soo! Soo! Sooie!

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:08.900
See if you can squeeze your
fat ass underneath this bridge!

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:14.113
Sound your horn!

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:17.325
You're nuts.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:20.203
Lady, please.
I gotta open the bridge.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:23.372
You gotta open the bridge.
I gotta jump. That's life.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:27.251
Everybody's got
something to do.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.487
Okay, you big dip!
See you out in the ocean!

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:55.363
Bye!

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.490
I'm comin' after you,
you bastards!

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.964
- Now!
- Now!

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:45.329
You know we got a bridge
comin' up our ass?

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.498
- Reverse the speed!
- We don't have a reverse.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.668
- Then cut the engines!
- All the goddamn gears are jammed!

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:53.504
- You, give me a hard right rudder!
- We don't have a rudder!

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:56.007
Asshole!

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:03.931
Open the goddamn bridge!

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:08.811
Bridge tender,
you son of a bitch, wake up!

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.733
Open the fuckin' bridge!

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:18.529
Open! Oh, God!

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.741
Daddy!

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:20.716
And so as we say
fareweil to our youth..

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:25.221
and our carefree days
offroiic and frivolity..

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:28.391
we are going out into a iargerworid...

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:32.937
Well, Wendy, I gotta hand it to you.
You really did it this time.

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:36.023
Yeah, this is gonna be
the best graduation ever.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.109
So when are we gonna do it?

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.195
- Do what?
- Didn't you tell Pee Wee about it?

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:43.322
- Of course I told him.
- Tell me what?

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.866
We're all gonna flash
when we get to the podium.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.869
- Flash what?
- In your case, not much.

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:52.081
Oh, you didn't think I fell for that
practical joke of yours, did you?

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:52.873
What practical joke?

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.042
About not wearing clothes
underneath our gowns...

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.294
and when we get to the podium,
mooning the audience.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:59.088
Chickened out.
I knew it.

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:03.467
Oh, yeah? Then how come you guys are
wearing clothes underneath your gowns?

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.929
It may look like we're dressed,
but in fact...

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.310
cut-offs.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:17.773
Go ahead. Just reach down
under your gown. Take 'em off.

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:19.775
- Should I?
- No one will see.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.986
You can do it, Pee Wee.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.613
- Just be subtle.
- I'm subtle.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:29.160
They wilI be our governors,
our lawyers, our surgeons..

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:32.496
our physicists, judges...
