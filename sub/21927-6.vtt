WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.160
I have a special treat
for y'all today.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.712
My dear friend and former
college roommate is here

00:06.924 --> 00:08.131
from the Johnson Space Center

00:08.342 --> 00:11.130
<i>in Houston to talk to us
about our space program.</i>

00:11.345 --> 00:13.302
And yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.050
These guys were roomies.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.213
How does one go on

00:16.433 --> 00:19.016
to be a...
a fancy scientist at NASA,

00:19.269 --> 00:21.431
and the other's teaching
freshman science

00:21.647 --> 00:23.013
at a public high school?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.018
Yeah, Sheldon.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.816
I was thinking that.

00:27.903 --> 00:28.768
Thank you.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.696
All right, uh, let's
give a warm welcome

00:31.907 --> 00:35.446
to my good buddy,
Dr. Ronald Hodges.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.448
Hey, kids. Hey.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.780
Glad to be here.
And, uh, Hubert, the answer

00:39.998 --> 00:43.708
to your question is, one of
those roomies was busy studying

00:43.919 --> 00:45.911
while the other was out
chasing high school girls.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.379
Yeah.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.799
To be clear, they
were all over 18.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.251
Yeah. Well...

00:54.263 --> 00:56.676
<i>Now, what I thought would
be fun to talk about today</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:00.258
is what NASA's planning on doing
beyond the space shuttle.

01:00.477 --> 01:04.061
Things like the first
manned mission to Mars.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.305
Uh, yeah.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.106
Did you see the movie <i>Aliens?</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:08.562
I did.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.234
Did you think it was cool?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.562
<i>Uh...</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:14.901
Sure, I enjoyed it.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.190
Me, too.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.360
Football player, right?

01:18.662 --> 01:19.573
Yes, sir.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.949
Yeah.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.407
Now, of course, before

01:23.625 --> 01:25.958
we can set out
to explore the solar system,

01:26.169 --> 01:28.286
we've got a few minor problems
to overcome.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.212
<i>Not the least of
which is, every time</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:32.590
we launch,
it costs the U.S. taxpayers

01:32.801 --> 01:34.963
hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.760
Oh, no, no, no.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.005
- Yes.
- If you want to save money,

01:39.224 --> 01:40.556
why don't you land
the booster rockets

01:40.767 --> 01:42.975
instead of letting them drop
in the ocean?

01:44.980 --> 01:48.564
That's a cute idea, but, uh,
it's not technically possible.

01:48.817 --> 01:49.898
Why not?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.728
Well, it's hard to explain.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.313
The math is pretty complicated.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.148
Perhaps
I could help you with it.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.862
<i>Well,</i>

01:59.077 --> 02:00.909
I bet you could.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.737
<i>I'll bet you could.</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:06.245
I'll tell you what.
Here is a NASA patch.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.794
Why don't you have your mom
sew that on your book bag? Now,

02:10.213 --> 02:12.626
who here wants to know how
astronauts go to the bathroom?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.082
<i>- Me. I do.
- Oh, right. See,</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.338
<i>now, during liftoff,
all the astronauts</i>

02:16.553 --> 02:17.543
wear diapers.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.838
<i>People often wonder why I chose</i>

02:20.057 --> 02:23.266
<i>to pursue a career
in theoretical physics.</i>

02:23.852 --> 02:25.639
<i>I usually respond by saying</i>

02:25.854 --> 02:28.813
<i>I wanted to unravel the
inner workings of the universe.</i>

02:29.024 --> 02:29.684
<i>Yeah, perhaps when</i>

02:29.900 --> 02:32.187
Captain Kirk said,
"To boldly go,"

02:32.402 --> 02:34.610
he meant in one of those, huh?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.403
<i>But the real answer was</i>

02:36.615 --> 02:38.698
<i>I wanted
to prove this nincompoop wrong.</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:40.616
<i>Yeah, that's right.
Beam me up, Potty!</i>

03:00.597 --> 03:02.384
<i>So I saw a lawyer today.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:03.423
Why?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.929
I'm putting together
my last will and testament.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.306
We're gonna miss ya.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.303
George.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.855
Don't worry.
I ain't leaving him squat.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.223
Are you dyin'?

03:12.442 --> 03:13.603
We're all
dyin', honey.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.730
From the second we're born,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.937
it's just a slip and slide
into the darkness.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.026
Unless you get
bit by a vampire.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.116
Well, now that goes
without saying.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.403
I don't want to die.
I've only kissed

03:25.622 --> 03:26.954
one boy so far.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.035
What?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.367
Relax. It was a
long time ago.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.918
Are you relaxed?

03:33.755 --> 03:34.415
Shelly, you haven't

03:34.631 --> 03:35.963
<i>touched your dinner.</i>

03:36.258 --> 03:37.294
You feel okay?

03:37.884 --> 03:40.001
Oh, yes. I was
just thinking.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.460
About what, baby?

03:41.847 --> 03:45.181
The optimal height-to-width
ratio for a reusable rocket.

03:46.143 --> 03:46.758
<i>I was just</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:48.639
thinking the exact same thing.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.268
Really?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.396
Oh, Moonpie, I love you so much.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.954
It's late. What
are you doing up?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.086
I'm working
on the hyperbolic calculations

04:19.301 --> 04:20.337
for a rocket return.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.130
Need any help?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.295
What?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.632
I'm kiddin'. Now, turn out
the light and go to bed.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.054
- But...
- Now.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.436
Dad, can we afford a computer?

04:37.027 --> 04:39.064
You do my taxes.
What do you think?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.112
Never mind.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.068
Good night.

05:13.772 --> 05:14.762
Meemaw?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.310
Mr. Moonpie,
how might I help you?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.195
How much money are you planning
to leave me when you die?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.522
Nice talkin' to you.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.151
<i>Meemaw?</i>

05:29.913 --> 05:31.279
Want to try that again?

05:31.498 --> 05:32.488
I need to buy a computer

05:32.707 --> 05:34.744
so I can solve
the Navier-Stokes equation.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.794
Uh-huh. How much is a computer?

05:38.004 --> 05:40.166
Apple has a nice one for $2,000,

05:40.382 --> 05:42.624
but the kind I need costs
three million.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.463
Let me see
what I got in the vault.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.221
Nine bucks and, uh...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.647
Oh, look at that... a peso.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.810
It's warm.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.652
Hello, First National Bank.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.828
I'd like to speak
with a loan officer.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.656
It's regarding a second mortgage
on my home.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.326
My name is Sheldon Lee Cooper.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.251
Sure, I'll hold.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.589
Oh, I hate hold music.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.790
Hello.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.548
Yes, you can help me,
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.672
I'm interested in taking out
a second mortgage.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.766
I'm nine years old.
Why do you ask?

06:34.686 --> 06:36.928
That's called
age discrimination, Dorothy,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.355
but I'm willing to let it slide.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.602
I'm glad you find me cute,
but I'm deadly serious.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.232
I need funds to buy a computer.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.025
No, the house isn't in my name.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.324
I'm nine.
We've established this.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.327
I do prepare the taxes
for my parents,

06:53.538 --> 06:54.745
and if we tighten our belts,

06:54.956 --> 06:56.822
we'll have sufficient equity
for the loan.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.328
Sheldon, who are
you talking to?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.535
Dorothy Fitzpatrick.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.911
Who's Dorothy Fitzpatrick?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.746
Is she a new buddy from school?

07:04.007 --> 07:06.920
She's the loan officer at The
First National Bank of Medford.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.216
Why are you talking to her?

07:08.803 --> 07:09.668
Mom, can this wait?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.005
I'm trying
to negotiate favorable terms.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.090
Hello. Dorothy?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.848
Hey, how come you
weren't in math class?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.480
That guy from NASA
treated me like a child,

07:24.694 --> 07:26.731
and I need to
prove him wrong.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.853
You <i>are</i> a child.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.814
Tread lightly, my friend.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.866
Was Ms. Ingram upset
I wasn't in class?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.115
Actually, she was happy.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.616
She even did a little dance.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.539
Do you know anybody
with a modem?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.867
I think
Radio Shack has one. Why?

07:41.086 --> 07:43.419
I need to access
thrust-to-weight ratios

07:43.630 --> 07:46.338
from the FTP server at
the Johnson Space Center.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.381
Then what?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.258
Then I show that guy
from NASA my work

07:49.469 --> 07:51.677
and laugh as he
begs for mercy.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.513
You know, sometimes
you sound like a super villain.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.760
Silence!

07:56.476 --> 07:57.216
That'll be more effective after

07:57.435 --> 07:58.801
your voice changes.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.351
Silence.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.021
Mom, can you take me
to Radio Shack?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.310
Not today, baby.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.113
I have to go food shopping
and get dinner started.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.153
But it's important.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.655
Sorry. Maybe over the weekend.

08:15.954 --> 08:16.944
But it won't take that long.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.620
Sheldon, I said no.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.415
- But, Mom...
- Not another word.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.076
What?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.120
Can't I just be happy?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.087
Mom, please!

08:31.302 --> 08:33.089
Sheldon Lee,
I said no.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.465
I'm still happy.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.099
Please, Mom!
You're being unfair!

08:39.309 --> 08:41.927
- No.
- But I really need those thrust-to-weight ratios.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.513
Do you see I'm cookin'?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.056
Well, take me <i>after</i> dinner.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.733
Enough! I'm not takin' you
anywhere tonight.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.151
<i>I'm not proud of it,</i>

08:50.363 --> 08:52.901
<i>but as a child, I was prone...</i>

08:53.158 --> 08:54.649
<i>to the occasional meltdown.</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:56.530
<i>Cheese and crackers!</i>

08:56.870 --> 08:59.283
<i>I'm sorry you had to hear that.</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:07.003
All right,
I finally got him calmed down.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.499
How'd you manage that?

09:08.715 --> 09:11.708
Easy. Gave him a hug
and a little cough syrup.

09:11.926 --> 09:12.586
Mom!

09:12.802 --> 09:15.044
It's not like he's
operating heavy machinery.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.634
We can't keep putting
up with this behavior.

09:18.141 --> 09:18.927
We need to ground him.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.260
How? If you say "No playing
outside," he says, "Thank you."

09:22.479 --> 09:23.686
Well, we need to do something.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.184
It's just a tantrum.
It's what kids do.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.731
You used to punish me
all the time.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.184
That was different.
You were a pain in the ass.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.111
I say no Radio Shack
for at least a month.

09:33.865 --> 09:34.571
Sounds fair.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.614
I'll go tell him.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.441
I'd wait and tell him tomorrow.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.326
He's a little loopy right now.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.207
Good night.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.288
She drugged our son.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.835
<i>Thus began the longest month of my life.</i>

09:54.052 --> 09:57.591
<i>Without the ability to access
the thrust-to-weight ratios,</i>

09:57.806 --> 10:00.970
<i>my well-intended effort
to humiliate a NASA scientist</i>

10:01.184 --> 10:02.265
<i>ground to a halt.</i>

10:02.477 --> 10:03.137
Mom.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.348
Uh... what's going on?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.601
Something's wrong with Sheldon.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.314
What's the matter, baby?
Have a tummy ache?

10:12.529 --> 10:13.815
I think it's an ulcer.

10:14.197 --> 10:14.903
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

10:15.115 --> 10:16.822
- You must have eaten something.
- No.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.696
My symptoms are consistent
with an ulcer.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.281
Shelly, remember
when you thought

10:21.496 --> 10:24.204
you had leprosy, and it was
just a patch of dry skin?

10:24.415 --> 10:27.203
And when you thought you had
gout? Or an enlarged prostate?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.408
Or mad cow?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.869
That was my favorite.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.000
Well, this is different.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.832
Maybe we should take
him to the doctor.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.086
Listen to your wife...
ulcers are serious.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.129
<i>Ow.</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:43.303
Well, I've never seen this
in someone so young,

10:43.601 --> 10:46.514
but, uh, your son has an ulcer.

10:46.938 --> 10:47.769
Thank you.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.222
How could this happen?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.519
<i>Uh, there are
a number of factors.</i>

10:52.026 --> 10:52.766
<i>Has he been under</i>

10:52.986 --> 10:55.069
some unusual stress lately?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.522
Yes. She won't take me
to Radio Shack.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.947
Go wait outside.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.611
I've heard
some interesting research

11:00.827 --> 11:02.068
about treating ulcers

11:02.287 --> 11:03.243
with antimicrobials.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.160
Go.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.827
And you're surprised
I have an ulcer.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.374
I'm surprised
<i>I</i> don't have one.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.374
Um, Radio Shack?

11:13.798 --> 11:16.791
He's trying to figure out
how to help NASA land rockets.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.717
Oh. Well, that's a nice thing.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.715
He's just doing
it out of spite.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.134
Okay.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.591
<i>Well,
keep him off spicy foods for the time being,</i>

11:25.810 --> 11:28.427
and I'll write you
a prescription for Zantac.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.644
Does he smoke?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.889
'Course not.
He's nine.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.770
I started at his age.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.768
Uh, but only when I drank.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.989
What the...?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.494
Sheldon!
What are you doing?

11:45.747 --> 11:48.285
I just need a minute.
These things are so slow.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.701
<i>Is this your family?</i>

11:52.003 --> 11:53.039
They're lovely.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.551
- Mom.
- What?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.754
There's something wrong
with Sheldon again.

12:03.973 --> 12:04.713
<i>I figured it out!</i>

12:04.933 --> 12:06.640
I figured it out!

12:07.435 --> 12:08.095
One night.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.976
I want to sleep one night.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.434
Oh. Hi, Mom.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.224
<i>Hi there.</i>

12:19.614 --> 12:22.903
<i>With my research
complete and my ulcer on the mend,</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:26.030
<i>all that was left to do
was send my work to NASA</i>

12:26.246 --> 12:29.660
<i>and wait to become America's
scientific sweetheart.</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:34.375
<i>So I waited...</i>

12:38.841 --> 12:40.377
<i>...and waited...</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:44.510
<i>...and waited...</i>

12:55.275 --> 12:56.482
<i>...and waited.</i>

13:00.405 --> 13:02.397
<i>Something's wrong
with Sheldon again.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:03.355
<i>Now what?</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:06.362
<i>Those people at NASA never
responded to his science stuff.</i>

13:06.577 --> 13:08.910
<i>Damn it.
I've had enough of this.</i>

13:09.539 --> 13:10.905
Sheldon, get up.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.911
What's the point?

13:14.335 --> 13:15.416
We're going to Houston.

13:17.046 --> 13:17.752
Really?

13:18.339 --> 13:19.250
Yeah.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.340
You and me are gonna give
those space monkeys

13:21.634 --> 13:22.920
a little talkin' to.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.094
<i>I often found my father to be</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:28.514
<i>a strange and puzzling man,</i>

13:28.725 --> 13:32.344
<i>but at that moment,
I never loved him more.</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:42.023
I don't see why I
couldn't stay home.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.943
'Cause we're having
a fun family outin'.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.485
Can I at least drive?

13:46.701 --> 13:48.784
She said fun, not tragic.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.529
Let's go to the ostrich farm.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.363
<i>Cool.</i>

13:52.582 --> 13:54.323
We can ride 'em, and
then we can eat 'em.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.532
<i>We're not stopping anywhere.</i>

13:55.752 --> 13:57.459
We're going to Houston
to straighten this thing out

13:57.670 --> 13:59.286
for your brother,
then we're going home.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.671
Shelly, you doing okay?

14:02.050 --> 14:04.133
Yes. I just hope I
don't get carsick.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.926
You want Daddy to pull over?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.544
I'll be okay.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.638
<i>Oh, God,</i>

14:09.849 --> 14:12.182
<i>it's on my shoes,
it's on my shoes!</i>

14:12.435 --> 14:15.018
<i>For Pete's sake,
somebody open a window.</i>

14:24.405 --> 14:25.145
Yeah, I don't
mean to be rude,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.105
but we've been
waitin' for an hour

14:26.324 --> 14:28.190
<i>- to see your boss.</i>
- I'm sorry, sir,

14:28.409 --> 14:30.321
- but you didn't have an appointment.
- We didn't have

14:30.536 --> 14:32.994
an appointment 'cause every time
I called, you put me on hold.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.707
I'm sure Dr. Hodges'll see you
as soon as he can.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.920
- So, what do you want to do?
- Well...

14:42.340 --> 14:44.457
I guess we just got
to be patient and wait...

14:44.675 --> 14:45.791
Aw, screw it!

14:46.135 --> 14:47.842
Excuse me, sir,
you can't just...

14:48.054 --> 14:49.386
<i>All right,
here's the deal.</i>

14:49.680 --> 14:50.921
<i>My kid's got
a damn ulcer 'cause of you,</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:53.473
<i>so either you
take him seriously,</i>

14:53.684 --> 14:55.721
<i>or you're gonna be
taking</i> me <i>seriously.</i>

14:57.438 --> 14:58.098
Yes, sir?

14:58.314 --> 14:59.600
<i>Janice, why don't you</i>

14:59.816 --> 15:01.352
<i>send the little boy in?</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:02.478
Right away.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.196
He'll see you now.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.823
You're up, Moonpie.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.032
<i>And here...</i>

15:19.752 --> 15:21.584
near apogee,
we gimbal the engine

15:21.796 --> 15:22.832
to exert a torque

15:23.047 --> 15:24.959
that executes
a pitchover maneuver

15:25.174 --> 15:28.212
to flip the rocket
by 180 degrees.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.967
Well, that's very impressive.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.513
Thank you very much
for taking the time...

15:33.724 --> 15:34.840
I'm not done.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.432
Oh.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.260
Uh... sorry.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.515
<i>Needless to say,</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:43.356
we use a P.I.D. controller
to minimize the dispersions

15:43.568 --> 15:45.230
to the landing site.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.440
Anything else?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.988
Yes. I'd like a glass of water.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.735
It's time to take my Zantac.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.651
Oh...

15:58.249 --> 15:59.660
He's been in there
quite a while.

15:59.876 --> 16:00.582
Well, if the topic

16:00.793 --> 16:03.285
is science, he can be
a really Chatty Patty.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.540
I'm bored.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.667
- Me, too.
- Hey.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.466
Someday somebody's gonna write
a book about Sheldon.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.547
Don't you want there
to be a chapter

16:11.762 --> 16:15.096
about how loving and supportive
you two were?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.220
Doesn't matter.
I ain't reading it.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.928
This is groundbreaking work.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.855
Thank you. And...?

16:24.567 --> 16:25.307
And...?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.768
I thought you might want
to apologize.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.856
Well...

16:29.155 --> 16:29.895
why?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.777
You tried to shut me up
with a patch.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.568
Well...
I-I give those to everyone.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.243
<i>A-And you have
to understand, Sheldon,</i>

16:37.455 --> 16:40.994
that while your math
is-is theoretically correct,

16:41.459 --> 16:44.202
we don't have the technical
capability to execute it.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.831
So I'm ahead of my time?

16:46.464 --> 16:49.502
Well... it would appear so.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.296
All right, call me
when you catch up.

16:53.137 --> 16:53.752
W... uh...

16:53.971 --> 16:55.212
We can go now.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.482
<i>I've often
contemplated what might have happened</i>

17:11.696 --> 17:14.234
<i>if my father hadn't stuck up
for me that day.</i>

17:14.492 --> 17:15.778
<i>Would I have gone on to become</i>

17:15.992 --> 17:17.905
<i>a world-class
theoretical physicist,</i>

17:18.162 --> 17:21.530
<i>or just your average Joe
Sixpack theoretical physicist?</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:22.489
Dad?

17:22.708 --> 17:23.618
Yeah?

17:24.669 --> 17:25.659
Thank you.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.499
You're welcome.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.341
We're real proud
of you, honey.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.588
- Are you proud of me and Georgie?
- Of course.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.718
You bet.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.215
For what?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.050
Don't go pokin' at it.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.281
<i>For the first time,</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:03.455
<i>SpaceX has successfully landed
its Falcon 9 rocket</i>

18:03.666 --> 18:06.079
<i>on a drone ship
in the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

18:11.841 --> 18:14.424
<i>SpaceX founder Elon Musk
called the event</i>

18:14.635 --> 18:17.298
<i>an "incredible milestone
in the history of space."</i>

18:25.271 --> 18:28.230
<i>- Elon, the CNN reporter's here to talk to you.</i>
- Hang on.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.564
Send him in.
