00:20.920 --> 00:23.411
It is definitely
the stolen space cruiser, captain.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.045
The Aurora. I read six aboard.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.085
Hailing frequencies.

00:29.262 --> 00:34.008
Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

00:34.184 --> 00:36.260
Acknowledge.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.726
Aurora, this is the Enterprise.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.650
Do you read me?

00:43.819 --> 00:46.820
- They are receiving us, captain.
- I read no evidence of malfunction.

00:46.989 --> 00:51.402
Repeat, Federation orders
to detain you for...

00:52.703 --> 00:54.742
They're veering off, sir.

00:56.582 --> 00:58.788
Change course.
Pursue and overtake.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.240
Aye, aye, sir.

01:04.090 --> 01:07.126
- Stand by tractor beams.
- Standing by, sir.

01:07.301 --> 01:11.714
If it continues on course,
it will enter Romulan space.

01:13.057 --> 01:15.382
- Engage.
- Tractor beam engaged.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.178
- Bring them in.
- They're struggling to escape.

01:19.355 --> 01:22.475
Their engines
are seriously overheating, captain.

01:24.819 --> 01:29.197
Aurora, cut power.
You are overtaxing your ship.

01:30.784 --> 01:33.987
Power approaching critical.
They cannot continue.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.949
Emergency power to tractor beams.

01:37.123 --> 01:39.793
Bridge to Transporter Room.
Scotty, are you ready to transport?

01:40.335 --> 01:41.366
Aye, captain.

01:42.045 --> 01:45.628
Power beyond critical.
Explosion is imminent.

01:49.803 --> 01:53.006
- Are we within transportation range?
- Not yet, sir.

01:56.352 --> 01:59.803
Aurora personnel,
stand by to be transported aboard.

02:05.611 --> 02:07.354
Energize.

02:12.451 --> 02:14.243
Are they aboard?

02:16.205 --> 02:18.531
Scotty, are they aboard?

02:22.211 --> 02:24.418
Aye, captain.

02:29.219 --> 02:33.347
They are. And a nice lot too.

02:48.822 --> 02:52.273
Space, the final frontier.

02:57.748 --> 03:01.876
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:02.044 --> 03:06.089
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:06.257 --> 03:10.005
to seek out new life
and new civilszations,

03:10.177 --> 03:13.546
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:56.141 --> 03:59.261
Captain's log, stardate 5832.3.

03:59.436 --> 04:02.686
The son of the Catuallan ambassador
is one of six we have beamed aboard

04:02.856 --> 04:04.813
from the stolen cruiser Aurora.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.819
We have been ordered
to handle him with extreme delicacy

04:07.986 --> 04:10.193
because the treaty negotiations
now in progress

04:10.364 --> 04:12.689
between the Federation
and Catualla

04:12.867 --> 04:15.108
are in a crucial phase.

04:15.286 --> 04:16.779
Scotty, take them
to the briefing room.

04:16.954 --> 04:19.659
We are not in the mood, Herbert.

04:20.541 --> 04:21.786
Irina?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.330
Thank you.

04:25.504 --> 04:27.793
Tell Herbert it's no go.

04:29.342 --> 04:31.631
- What's going on?
- They refuse, sir.

04:31.803 --> 04:33.676
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.

04:33.846 --> 04:35.839
They're just sitting on the floor,
the lot of them.

04:36.015 --> 04:38.850
You can hear them yourself.
Shall I send for security?

04:39.018 --> 04:42.185
No. I'll be right down. Mr. Spock.

04:43.690 --> 04:47.225
No go, no go, no go.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.362
Which one of you is Tongo Rad?

04:58.205 --> 05:00.162
You can thank
your father's influence

05:00.332 --> 05:01.992
for the fact
that you're not under arrest.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.365
In addition to piracy,

05:03.543 --> 05:06.248
you've left yourself open to charges
of violating flight regulations,

05:06.421 --> 05:07.916
entering hostile space

05:08.090 --> 05:10.711
and endangering the lives
of others as well as your own.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.082
I'm bleeding.

05:12.261 --> 05:16.389
In addition,
you've caused an interstellar incident

05:16.557 --> 05:19.226
which may have destroyed
everything that's been negotiated

05:19.393 --> 05:21.552
between your planet
and the Federation.

05:21.729 --> 05:23.887
You've got a hard lip, Herbert.

05:24.774 --> 05:29.649
If you have an explanation,
I am prepared to hear it.

05:44.627 --> 05:47.961
Well, Mr. Spock, take them
to Sickbay for a medical check.

05:48.131 --> 05:51.002
There may have been radiation
from the explosion.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.758
Captain, with your permission...

05:55.263 --> 05:56.461
By all means.

06:05.816 --> 06:07.358
One.

06:09.111 --> 06:13.109
- We are One.
- One is the beginning.

06:13.282 --> 06:15.488
Are you One, Herbert?

06:17.035 --> 06:21.116
- I am not Herbert.
- He's not Herbert. We reach.

06:21.290 --> 06:24.291
If you will state your purpose
and your objectives,

06:24.460 --> 06:27.829
perhaps we can arrive
at a mutual understanding.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.298
If you understand One,

06:31.634 --> 06:33.461
you know our purpose.

06:33.636 --> 06:36.127
I would prefer that you state it.

06:36.305 --> 06:39.805
We turn our backs on confusion
and seek the beginning.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.930
- What is your destination?
- The planet Eden.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.981
That planet is a myth.

06:47.483 --> 06:50.153
And we protest
against being harassed,

06:50.320 --> 06:54.863
pursued, attacked, seized and
transported here against our wishes.

06:55.033 --> 06:57.785
- Right, brother.
- We do not recognise

06:57.952 --> 06:59.411
Federation regulations.

06:59.579 --> 07:02.616
Nor the existence of hostilities.

07:02.791 --> 07:07.334
We recognise no authority,
save that within ourselves.

07:07.504 --> 07:10.873
Well whether you recognise authority
or not, I am it on this ship.

07:11.049 --> 07:14.003
I am under orders to transport you
back to starbase, peaceably.

07:14.177 --> 07:17.214
From there you'll be ferried
to your various planets.

07:17.389 --> 07:21.339
Because of my orders,
you are not prisoners, but my guests.

07:21.518 --> 07:23.345
I expect you to behave as such.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.557
Oh, Herbert, you are stiff.

07:29.276 --> 07:32.526
Mr. Spock, you seem to understand
these people. You will deal with them.

07:32.696 --> 07:35.733
We respectfully request
that you take us to Eden.

07:35.908 --> 07:37.616
And after they're finished in Sickbay,

07:37.785 --> 07:40.276
see to it that they're escorted
back to their proper quarters.

07:40.454 --> 07:42.577
- Give them whatever care they need.
- Yes, captain.

07:42.748 --> 07:47.375
We respectfully request
that you take us to Eden.

07:49.130 --> 07:52.713
I have orders to the contrary.
This is not a passenger ship.

07:52.884 --> 07:55.422
Herbert! Herbert! Herbert!

08:03.269 --> 08:05.677
Lieutenant Palmer, notify starbase
we have the six aboard

08:05.855 --> 08:09.271
who stole the space cruiser Aurora.
Regrettably, the space cruiser itself

08:09.442 --> 08:10.522
- was destroyed.
- Aye, sir.

08:10.694 --> 08:12.271
Personal note
to the Catuallan ambassador:

08:12.446 --> 08:13.856
- His son is safe.
- Captain.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.863
- Yes, what is it?
- Sir, I believe I know one of them.

08:18.035 --> 08:21.569
At least, I think I recognise her voice.

08:21.747 --> 08:25.282
Her name is Irina Galliulin.

08:25.459 --> 08:28.745
We were in
Starfleet Academy together.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.587
One of those was in the Academy?

08:32.758 --> 08:34.798
Yes, sir.

08:34.969 --> 08:38.135
She dropped out.

08:38.514 --> 08:40.092
She...

08:42.393 --> 08:44.220
Do you wish to see her?

08:45.980 --> 08:49.016
- Permission to leave your post.
- Thank you, sir.

08:51.652 --> 08:54.190
- Are they in the Sickbay?
- Yes, captain.

08:55.698 --> 08:57.323
Mr. Spock.

08:58.076 --> 09:02.239
Do they really believe
that Eden exists?

09:02.413 --> 09:04.572
Many myths
are based on truth, captain.

09:04.749 --> 09:06.493
And they are not unintelligent.

09:06.668 --> 09:10.001
- Their leader Dr. Sevrin, is a man...
- Dr. Sevrin is their leader?

09:10.171 --> 09:14.549
Yes. A brilliant research engineer
in the fields of acoustics,

09:14.718 --> 09:17.754
communications,
and electronics on Tiburon.

09:17.929 --> 09:21.630
He was dismissed from his post
when he started this movement.

09:21.808 --> 09:24.975
Tong Rad inherits his father's
extraordinary abilities

09:25.145 --> 09:27.636
in the field of space studies.

09:29.358 --> 09:32.727
But they've rejected all that

09:32.903 --> 09:36.070
and all that this technology provides.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.363
And they seek the primitive.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.989
There are many who are

09:41.161 --> 09:44.531
uncomfortable
with what we have created.

09:44.707 --> 09:47.032
It is almost a biological rebellion.

09:47.209 --> 09:50.413
A profound revulsion against
the planned communities,

09:50.588 --> 09:51.963
the programming,

09:52.131 --> 09:56.176
the sterilized,
artfully-balanced atmospheres.

09:56.344 --> 10:01.053
They hunger for an Eden
where spring comes.

10:01.224 --> 10:05.553
We all do.
The cave is deep in our memory.

10:05.728 --> 10:08.398
Yes, that is true, captain.

10:08.565 --> 10:13.191
But we don't steal space cruisers
and act like irresponsible children.

10:13.361 --> 10:15.188
What makes you so sympathetic
toward them?

10:15.363 --> 10:19.575
It is not sympathy,
so much as curiosity, captain.

10:19.743 --> 10:21.985
A wish to understand.

10:22.162 --> 10:26.539
They regard themselves
as aliens in their own worlds,

10:26.708 --> 10:29.793
a condition with which
I am somewhat familiar.

10:37.594 --> 10:39.053
Spock.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.676
What does Herbert mean?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.301
It is...

10:45.895 --> 10:50.058
...somewhat uncomplimentary,
captain.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.732
Herbert was a minor official

10:53.903 --> 10:56.987
notorious for his rigid

10:57.156 --> 11:00.359
and limited patterns of thought.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.745
Well, I shall try to be
less rigid in my thinking.

11:07.875 --> 11:12.039
Lookin' for the good land

11:12.213 --> 11:16.507
Goin' astray

11:16.676 --> 11:22.512
Don't cry, don't cry

11:22.682 --> 11:26.929
Oh, I can't have honey

11:27.103 --> 11:32.062
And I can't have cream

11:32.234 --> 11:36.481
Gonna live, not die

11:36.655 --> 11:41.282
Gonna live, not die

11:41.452 --> 11:45.496
Stand in the middle of it all one day

11:45.664 --> 11:52.545
Look at it shinin' all around me
And say

11:52.713 --> 11:56.331
I'm here!

11:56.509 --> 12:00.257
I'm here

12:00.429 --> 12:06.183
In the good land
In the new land

12:06.519 --> 12:10.137
I'm here

12:17.322 --> 12:22.031
Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you?

12:22.202 --> 12:24.029
She's getting her physical.

12:24.204 --> 12:26.243
Gonna crack my knuckles
and jump for joy,

12:26.414 --> 12:30.198
I got a clean bill of health
from Dr. McCoy.

12:31.169 --> 12:33.043
- You know Irina?
- Say, tell me.

12:33.213 --> 12:35.087
Why do you wear all those clothes?

12:35.257 --> 12:37.166
How do you breathe?

12:39.678 --> 12:41.338
You're next.

12:52.566 --> 12:55.733
- Irina.
- Pavel Andreievich.

12:56.612 --> 12:59.150
I had thought
we might encounter each other.

12:59.323 --> 13:02.490
- You knew I was on the Enterprise?
- I had heard.

13:03.411 --> 13:07.195
Irina, why..?

13:11.919 --> 13:13.330
Come.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.384
How could you do this to yourself?

13:20.553 --> 13:23.424
You were a scientist.
And now look at you.

13:23.598 --> 13:26.054
Look at yourself, Pavel.

13:26.976 --> 13:29.894
- Why did you do it?
- Why did you?

13:33.483 --> 13:37.397
I'm proud of what I am.
I believe in what I do.

13:37.946 --> 13:40.188
- Can you say that?
- Yes.

13:41.241 --> 13:44.277
Oh, we should not tear
at each other so, Pavel.

13:44.453 --> 13:47.074
We should meet again in joy.

13:47.414 --> 13:49.739
Today when I first knew
it was your ship that followed us,

13:49.917 --> 13:53.784
I thought of you
and wondered what I would find.

13:55.255 --> 13:58.126
And I remembered so much.

14:00.844 --> 14:06.930
In spite of that uniform, I still see
the same Pavel I used to know.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.768
Are you happy in what you do?

14:14.275 --> 14:15.769
Yes.

14:17.195 --> 14:19.567
Then I accept what you do.

14:19.739 --> 14:22.194
You even talk like them.

14:27.538 --> 14:31.204
- Why did you go away?
- It was you who went.

14:31.376 --> 14:33.084
I came back to look for you.

14:34.129 --> 14:35.587
I looked.

14:36.715 --> 14:38.375
Where did you go?

14:38.550 --> 14:40.792
I stayed in the city.

14:41.469 --> 14:43.343
With friends.

14:45.849 --> 14:49.265
- You never felt as I did. Never.
- I did.

14:49.436 --> 14:52.271
You don't have it in you
to feel so much.

14:52.439 --> 14:55.475
Even when we were close,
you weren't with me.

14:55.651 --> 14:58.817
You were off,
thinking of something else.

14:59.822 --> 15:02.313
Why did you stay away?

15:03.909 --> 15:06.994
Because you disapproved of me.

15:07.162 --> 15:09.369
Just as you do now.

15:11.959 --> 15:15.043
Oh, Pavel, you have always
been like this.

15:15.212 --> 15:19.791
So correct. And inside,
the struggle not to be.

15:19.967 --> 15:22.838
Give in to yourself.
You will be happier.

15:23.596 --> 15:25.423
You'll see.

15:29.852 --> 15:31.928
Go to your friends.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.708
We want to see him right now.
We want to see him now!

16:08.058 --> 16:10.893
Herbert! Herbert! Herbert!

16:11.061 --> 16:12.971
I thought animals
were kept in cages.

16:13.147 --> 16:15.056
What's going on, Bones?

16:15.983 --> 16:18.059
Trouble. Friend here
didn't want a checkup.

16:18.235 --> 16:19.611
Turns out there's a reason.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.352
- I refuse to accept your findings.
- You don't have the choice.

16:22.531 --> 16:24.571
They are the product of prejudice,
not science.

16:24.742 --> 16:27.577
I don't know what this man was
planning on doing on a primitive planet,

16:27.745 --> 16:30.367
but assuming one did exist, I can
tell you what would have happened

16:30.540 --> 16:32.579
- had he settled there.
- Untrue.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.372
Would have been enough of those
primitives left to bury their dead.

16:35.545 --> 16:38.795
- Fantasy, fantasy.
- I wish it were.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.966
There's a nasty little bug evolved
in the last few years, Jim.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.922
Our septic-sterilized
civilisations produced it.

16:45.096 --> 16:47.005
Synthococcus novae. It's deadly.

16:47.182 --> 16:48.427
We can immunize against it,

16:48.600 --> 16:51.173
but we haven't learned
to lick all the problems yet.

16:51.353 --> 16:53.511
Does he have it?
What about the others?

16:53.688 --> 16:55.930
The others are clear.
He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.

16:56.108 --> 16:57.934
Remember your ancient history?
Typhoid Mary?

16:58.110 --> 16:59.520
He's immune to it, as she was,

16:59.695 --> 17:02.612
but he carries the disease
and spreads it to others.

17:02.781 --> 17:04.773
- Is the crew in danger?
- I don't know.

17:04.950 --> 17:07.488
They had full-spectrum
immunizations before boarding.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.950
Now, my guess is that his friends
have had their shots too.

17:10.122 --> 17:12.874
But a regular programme
of booster shots is necessary.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.663
I'll have to check everyone on the ship,
there could be some skips.

17:15.836 --> 17:18.410
In the meantime,
he should be placed in total isolation.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.166
This is outrageous.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.962
You're not isolating me.
You're imprisoning me.

17:23.135 --> 17:25.626
You invent the crime, find me guilty,
and sentence me.

17:25.805 --> 17:27.632
Would you like to run
the test yourself, doctor?

17:27.807 --> 17:30.298
You knew you were a carrier
before you came aboard, didn't you?

17:30.476 --> 17:32.433
- No!
- Why did you fight the examination?

17:32.603 --> 17:35.177
- It was an infringement on my rights.
- Put him in isolation.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.829
Be ready for the objections, Jim.
They are a vocal lot.

17:49.996 --> 17:53.199
Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to security.

17:53.375 --> 17:58.202
I want a guard maintained
on Dr. Sevrin until further notice.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.088
Bones, how long before we know

18:00.257 --> 18:03.008
whether the crew has been
endangered by this infection?

18:03.176 --> 18:06.676
Lt'll show in 24 hours.
It's a virulent strain.

18:10.893 --> 18:13.763
You don't belong with them.
You know what we want.

18:13.937 --> 18:18.101
You want it too. Come, join us.

18:18.275 --> 18:20.980
- How do you know what I want?
- You're young.

18:22.112 --> 18:24.070
Think young, brother.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.948
You make it tempting.

18:27.660 --> 18:29.119
Mr. Sulu.

18:32.748 --> 18:34.741
Mr. Sulu, explain.

18:35.751 --> 18:37.827
No explanation, sir.

18:38.588 --> 18:43.000
Dr. Sevrin will be released
when we think he is medically safe.

18:44.719 --> 18:47.388
Stiff man puttin' my mind in jail

18:47.555 --> 18:50.556
And the judge bang the gavel
and say, "No bail"

18:50.725 --> 18:54.557
Gonna lick his hand
And wag my tail

18:54.729 --> 18:57.101
Herbert! Herbert! Herbert!

19:01.570 --> 19:03.562
Engineering to Bridge.

19:04.239 --> 19:05.733
- Yes, Scotty, what is it?
- Captain.

19:05.907 --> 19:08.659
I just had to give one of those
bare-footed what-do-you-call-thems

19:08.827 --> 19:10.903
the boot out of here. He came in,
bold as brass

19:11.079 --> 19:12.657
tried to incite my crew to disaffect.

19:12.831 --> 19:14.871
Thank you, Scotty.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.711
Mr. Spock, I don't seem to be able
to communicate with these people.

19:17.878 --> 19:21.164
Do you think you can
persuade them to behave?

19:21.340 --> 19:23.379
- I shall make an attempt.
- Thank you, Mr. Spock.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.673
If it weren't
for that ambassador's son,

19:25.844 --> 19:28.382
- they'd all be in the brig.
- Yes, sir.

19:28.556 --> 19:31.592
Captain's log, stardate 5832.5.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.175
The arrogance of Dr. Sevrin
and his followers

19:34.353 --> 19:37.390
is creating an intolerable situation
aboard the Enterprise.

19:37.565 --> 19:39.604
If it continues,
I'll be forced to use controls

19:39.775 --> 19:42.445
which might not agree
with Starfleet's suggestion

19:42.612 --> 19:45.648
that they be handled
with extreme tolerance.

19:45.823 --> 19:48.610
I have no influence
over what they do.

19:48.785 --> 19:52.450
They respect you.
They will listen to your reasoning.

19:52.872 --> 19:55.577
For their sake, you must stop them.

19:57.126 --> 20:00.745
Dr. Sevrin, I am in a position
to help you and your group.

20:00.922 --> 20:03.247
I can use the resources
of the Enterprise

20:03.425 --> 20:06.924
to determine whether or not
Eden actually exists

20:07.095 --> 20:09.467
and to plot its exact location.

20:09.639 --> 20:11.264
I can present a case to Federation

20:11.433 --> 20:14.434
to allow you and your group
to colonise that planet.

20:15.896 --> 20:20.143
Neither you nor your people
are at present charged with a crime.

20:20.317 --> 20:25.477
However, incitement
to disaffection is criminal.

20:25.656 --> 20:28.823
Federation will never allow the
colonization of a planet by criminals.

20:28.992 --> 20:34.153
If they persist, they will be so charged
and forever barred from Eden.

20:34.331 --> 20:38.459
- As I have been barred?
- Then you knew you were a carrier.

20:39.503 --> 20:42.041
Of course I knew.

20:43.799 --> 20:46.207
You've researched my life.

20:46.385 --> 20:48.508
You've read the orders
restricting me to travel

20:48.679 --> 20:53.009
only in areas of advanced technology
because of what my body carries.

20:53.184 --> 20:56.683
What I fail to understand
is why you disobey those orders.

20:56.854 --> 21:00.021
Because this is poison to me!

21:03.361 --> 21:07.026
This stuff you breath,

21:07.198 --> 21:10.365
this stuff you live in.

21:11.244 --> 21:16.831
Shields of artificial atmosphere that
we have layered about every planet.

21:18.627 --> 21:24.712
The programmes in those computers
that run your ship and your lives for you,

21:24.883 --> 21:28.928
they bred what my body carries.

21:30.472 --> 21:33.888
That's what your science
have done to me.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.219
You've infected me.

21:43.027 --> 21:45.600
Only the primitives can cleanse me.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.816
I cannot purge myself
until I am among them.

21:48.991 --> 21:53.949
Only their way of living is right.
I must go to them.

21:54.121 --> 21:58.036
Your very presence will destroy
the people you seek.

21:58.209 --> 22:00.534
Surely you know that.

22:00.712 --> 22:03.831
I shall go to them
and be one with them.

22:04.465 --> 22:08.463
And together we shall build a world
such as this galaxy has never seen.

22:09.512 --> 22:13.213
A world. A life.

22:14.017 --> 22:15.725
A life.

22:24.694 --> 22:26.486
So now you're gonna try
to persuade me

22:26.655 --> 22:29.110
that your technologies
will find a cure for me

22:29.283 --> 22:31.275
and then I'll be free to go.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.278
Yes, doctor.

22:33.954 --> 22:36.659
And for that reason I should persuade
my friends to behave

22:36.832 --> 22:38.540
so that they too will be allowed.

22:38.709 --> 22:39.824
Yes, doctor.

22:43.631 --> 22:46.797
All right. You send them in.
I'll talk to them.

22:56.310 --> 23:00.260
Dr. Sevrin is insane.

23:01.274 --> 23:04.440
I have not consulted Dr. McCoy,
but I have no doubt of it.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.817
I'll have Bones check him out.

23:08.281 --> 23:10.986
Spock, I'm sorry.
You had great respect for him.

23:11.159 --> 23:13.994
But it does explain some
of what they've done.

23:14.162 --> 23:18.207
His condition does not affect
my interest in the movement.

23:18.375 --> 23:21.826
There is no insanity
in what they seek.

23:22.337 --> 23:26.335
I made a promise
which I should like to keep.

23:26.675 --> 23:30.174
With your permission,
I must locate Eden.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.514
I shall work in my quarters.

23:33.682 --> 23:37.846
May I have the assistance
of Mr. Chekov in auxiliary control?

23:39.021 --> 23:40.301
Certainly.

23:41.356 --> 23:43.930
Mr. Chekov, assist Mr. Spock.

23:45.152 --> 23:47.192
- Bridge to Sickbay.
- McCoy here.

23:47.363 --> 23:49.735
- Bones.
- Yes, captain.

23:49.907 --> 23:51.235
I'd like to talk to you.

23:52.827 --> 23:55.448
Captain's log, stardate 5832.6.

23:55.621 --> 23:58.195
I have asked Dr. McCoy to check
Starfleet medical records

23:58.374 --> 24:01.957
to verify Mr. Spock's suspicion
that Dr. Sevrin is insane.

24:02.128 --> 24:05.164
In spite of Dr. Sevrin's antipathy
to us, he has promised Mr. Spock

24:05.339 --> 24:10.298
that he will order his disciples to
conform to our rules and regulations.

24:10.470 --> 24:11.964
Come in.

24:13.556 --> 24:14.719
Am I crossing you?

24:15.934 --> 24:16.965
No.

24:17.685 --> 24:21.220
I was just thinking...
Hey, brother, do you play?

24:22.023 --> 24:23.648
Is it Vulcan?

24:23.900 --> 24:25.727
Can I try it?

24:35.912 --> 24:37.620
That's now.

24:37.789 --> 24:40.078
That's real now.

24:43.754 --> 24:46.838
I reach that, brother. I really do.

24:47.841 --> 24:49.419
Give.

25:13.785 --> 25:15.824
Hey, how about a session?

25:15.995 --> 25:18.533
You and us. It would sound.

25:18.706 --> 25:20.580
That's what I came for.
I wanted to ask,

25:20.750 --> 25:23.917
you know, great white captain upstairs,
but he don't reach us.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.830
But would he shake on a session?

25:26.005 --> 25:29.920
I mean, we want to cooperate,
like you ask, so I'm asking.

25:30.093 --> 25:35.467
If I understand you correctly,
I believe the answer might be yes.

25:37.726 --> 25:39.101
I'll spread the word.

25:48.820 --> 25:50.860
Am I allowed in?

25:51.323 --> 25:52.568
Yes.

25:52.741 --> 25:55.446
I have been looking for you, Pavel.

25:58.998 --> 26:01.074
What room is this?

26:01.250 --> 26:03.622
Auxiliary control.

26:04.795 --> 26:05.910
What's it for?

26:06.088 --> 26:09.006
Should the main control room
break down or suffer damage,

26:09.175 --> 26:11.844
we can navigate the ship from here.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.847
What do you want?

26:19.519 --> 26:25.023
To apologise. I should not
have teased you. It was cruel.

26:25.775 --> 26:28.729
- It does not matter.
- Oh, but it does.

26:28.903 --> 26:31.857
It is against everything I believe in.

26:32.699 --> 26:36.317
Let us not discuss your beliefs.

26:36.494 --> 26:39.910
And I do not like
having you angry with me.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.660
Or disapproving.

26:42.792 --> 26:45.710
Then why do you do such things?

26:48.131 --> 26:50.539
What are you working on?

26:51.593 --> 26:57.513
I am assisting Mr. Spock
in locating your Eden.

26:58.934 --> 27:01.555
Now you are teasing me.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.480
I am not.

27:04.648 --> 27:06.807
These tapes contain star charts

27:06.984 --> 27:10.400
and we project the orbits
of the various planets here.

27:12.448 --> 27:15.319
By a mathematical process,
we determine whether or not

27:15.493 --> 27:19.906
they are affected by other bodies
not yet charted.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.752
Do you know all these things?

27:27.130 --> 27:31.079
What I do not know I find out
from the computer banks.

27:31.259 --> 27:34.924
If I knew nothing at all,

27:35.096 --> 27:39.675
I could navigate the ship simply
by studying what is stored in there.

27:44.105 --> 27:48.150
They contain the sum
of all human knowledge.

27:48.318 --> 27:52.945
They solve our problems
on navigation.

27:53.115 --> 27:55.950
Of control.

27:56.118 --> 27:58.953
Of life-support.

27:59.121 --> 28:03.450
They tell you what to do
and you do what they tell you.

28:03.625 --> 28:08.620
No. We use our own judgement also.

28:09.381 --> 28:12.585
I could never obey a computer.

28:13.302 --> 28:17.300
You could never listen to anyone.

28:17.807 --> 28:22.219
You always had to be different.

28:22.395 --> 28:26.938
Not different. What I wanted to be.

28:27.525 --> 28:31.274
There is nothing wrong
in doing what you want.

28:40.330 --> 28:43.200
I am not receiving, Mr. Chekov.

28:43.875 --> 28:48.122
Spock to Chekov.
Repeat. I am not receiving.

28:51.508 --> 28:54.260
I am sorry, Mr. Spock.

28:57.764 --> 29:02.177
I was momentarily delayed.

29:07.983 --> 29:10.521
His name is Sulu,
specialist in weapons and navigation.

29:10.694 --> 29:11.773
His hobby is botany.

29:11.945 --> 29:13.985
- Can?
- Can. I reach Botany.

29:14.156 --> 29:16.445
- It's my favourite of studies.
- What's yours?

29:16.617 --> 29:20.662
Vulcan.
Spock is practically One now.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.540
Everything can be handled
from auxiliary control.

29:27.712 --> 29:30.167
The computers contain
all the information we need.

29:30.339 --> 29:32.166
- We can do it.
- It starts to chime.

29:32.341 --> 29:33.373
- When will it?
- Soon.

29:33.551 --> 29:35.508
Like he said now,
we should all go out

29:35.678 --> 29:37.587
and try to swing
as many as possible over.

29:37.764 --> 29:39.637
You suggest any special ways
to swing them?

29:39.807 --> 29:41.634
Just be friendly.

29:41.809 --> 29:44.098
You know how to be friendly.

29:46.481 --> 29:48.224
Then they'll be friendly.

30:00.287 --> 30:03.407
I'm talkin' about you

30:04.416 --> 30:07.619
I'm talkin' about me

30:11.215 --> 30:13.587
Long time back when the

30:13.759 --> 30:16.464
Galaxy was new

30:18.764 --> 30:23.759
Man found out what he had to do

30:26.021 --> 30:29.058
Found he had to eat
And he found he had to drink

30:29.233 --> 30:32.768
And a long time later
He found he had to think

30:36.490 --> 30:39.445
Yes, think

30:41.120 --> 30:43.955
- I'm standing here wondering.
- What?

30:46.960 --> 30:49.961
If a man tells another man:

30:50.129 --> 30:52.965
Out of my way

30:54.300 --> 30:56.838
He piles up trouble

30:57.011 --> 31:00.131
For himself all day

31:01.975 --> 31:05.261
But all kinds of trouble
Come to an end

31:05.437 --> 31:08.770
When a man tells another man
"Be my friend"

31:12.527 --> 31:15.481
My friend

31:17.032 --> 31:18.491
Well, what's it going to be?

31:18.659 --> 31:25.456
There's a mile-wide emptiness

31:25.624 --> 31:29.622
Between you and me

31:33.132 --> 31:36.465
Can't reach across it

31:36.635 --> 31:41.262
Hardly even see

31:44.060 --> 31:46.847
Someone ought to take a step

31:47.021 --> 31:51.932
One way or other

31:52.694 --> 31:54.900
Let's say goodbye

31:55.071 --> 31:59.698
Or let's say "Brother"

31:59.868 --> 32:03.153
Brother

32:03.330 --> 32:06.699
Brother

32:06.875 --> 32:09.330
Hey, out there

32:10.128 --> 32:12.619
Hey, out there

32:13.548 --> 32:15.921
Hey, out there

32:16.927 --> 32:19.169
Hey, out there

32:19.721 --> 32:22.841
- I see you
- I see you

32:23.016 --> 32:26.848
- I see you
- I see you

32:28.355 --> 32:31.558
Let's get together and have some fun

32:31.734 --> 32:34.403
I don't know how to do it
But it's got to be done

33:37.468 --> 33:40.588
At least we know where they are
and what they're doing.

33:40.763 --> 33:42.222
I don't know why a young mind

33:42.389 --> 33:45.141
has to be an undisciplined one.
Troublemakers.

33:45.309 --> 33:49.058
I used to get into a little trouble when
I was that age, Scotty. Didn't you?

34:36.360 --> 34:40.027
Captain,
I get no response from controls.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.859
We're going off course.

34:42.034 --> 34:47.491
It's shorted. No,
it's channelled over somewhere.

34:47.873 --> 34:50.080
To auxiliary control.

34:52.168 --> 34:55.335
Bridge to auxiliary control.
Bridge to auxiliary control.

34:55.505 --> 34:57.878
Captain, it seems as though
someone else is running the ship.

34:58.050 --> 35:01.633
That's right.
Someone else is running this ship.

35:01.804 --> 35:03.880
I am.

35:04.056 --> 35:07.639
All functions. Life-support as well.

35:07.810 --> 35:11.179
You cannot interfere, as I have
frozen the doors to the control room.

35:11.356 --> 35:13.811
I do not intend to hand over
the helm to you

35:13.983 --> 35:16.023
until and unless we reach Eden.

35:16.194 --> 35:19.278
And if I am in any way prevented
from reaching that destination,

35:19.447 --> 35:22.448
I shall destroy this ship
and all aboard.

35:22.951 --> 35:25.786
- Can he do it?
- He has the capability, captain.

35:25.954 --> 35:27.697
He's got everything
channelled over.

35:27.873 --> 35:29.367
Start a trace-back on all circuits.

35:29.541 --> 35:32.079
- See if you can bypass him.
- Do that and I shall retaliate.

35:32.252 --> 35:33.830
I shall not warn you again.

35:34.004 --> 35:36.412
Captain, we're now
leaving the Neutral Zone.

35:36.590 --> 35:38.084
Bearing into Romulan space.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.424
Any patrols?

35:46.141 --> 35:48.929
- Negative.
- There will be soon.

35:51.522 --> 35:53.265
Dr. Sevrin,

35:54.024 --> 35:57.856
you are violating Romulan space and
endangering the peace of the galaxy.

35:58.029 --> 36:02.358
The Romulans will view this
as a military intrusion and attack.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.027
Bring the ship about now.

36:04.202 --> 36:05.826
If you bring her about

36:05.995 --> 36:08.830
and return to starbase,
no charges will be levelled.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.572
Like you said, Brother Sevrin.

36:13.878 --> 36:15.622
If you do not,

36:15.797 --> 36:17.505
you will never reach Eden.

36:17.674 --> 36:19.666
You and this ship will be destroyed.

36:19.843 --> 36:23.543
He's got jelly in the belly.
Real scared.

36:25.223 --> 36:26.634
Adam,

36:27.350 --> 36:31.265
Rad, you are being led
by a man who is insane.

36:32.647 --> 36:35.648
You are being used by him.

36:39.571 --> 36:43.071
Spock, you tell them.

36:45.327 --> 36:46.786
Adam,

36:47.121 --> 36:50.038
there is a file on Dr. Sevrin
in our computer banks.

36:50.207 --> 36:52.828
In it you'll find a report
attesting to the fact

36:53.002 --> 36:55.789
that he is a carrier
of a bacillus strain

36:55.963 --> 36:57.872
known as Synthococcus novae.

36:58.048 --> 36:59.591
Ain't that just awful?

37:02.511 --> 37:04.338
You'll find a report
from the same hospital

37:04.513 --> 37:07.265
giving a full psychological profile
on him

37:07.433 --> 37:09.722
and projecting these actions of his.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.014
- Yea, brother.
- Adam,

37:13.272 --> 37:15.016
you know I reach you.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.764
I believe in what you seek.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.609
But there is a tragic difference
between what you want

37:21.781 --> 37:23.062
and what he wants.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.732
You're making me cry.

37:28.663 --> 37:32.412
There it is. They've established Eden,
Brother Sevrin.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.126
Pavel said they would.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.046
Our original course
must have been somewhat in error.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.748
- When will we get there?
- At this speed, three hours.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.257
They'll try to persuade us
to change course presently

37:43.428 --> 37:44.460
and then they'll attack.

37:44.638 --> 37:47.211
How will you plan to stop them?
By cutting off their life-support?

37:47.391 --> 37:50.973
I have another weapon.
Take control, Brother Rad.

37:55.399 --> 37:56.679
What are you doing?

37:56.859 --> 37:59.564
Making an adjustment
on their circuits.

38:03.324 --> 38:09.991
Head now to Eden

38:11.332 --> 38:17.750
Yea, brother

38:19.966 --> 38:26.763
Head now to Eden

38:28.808 --> 38:31.809
No more trouble

38:31.978 --> 38:36.936
In my body or my mind

38:37.108 --> 38:44.107
Wanna live like a king
On whatever I find

38:44.282 --> 38:47.865
Eat all the fruit

38:48.036 --> 38:52.366
And throw away the rind

38:52.541 --> 38:57.997
Yea, brother

38:58.172 --> 39:00.710
Yea

39:00.883 --> 39:07.217
We are within sensor range of Eden
and continuing to approach.

39:08.349 --> 39:11.219
Whatever they're going to do, they're
going to do now. We have no choice.

39:11.393 --> 39:13.433
Mr. Spock, Mr. Scott.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.857
- When will you use that?
- At the proper time.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.564
- Let me know when we're in orbit.
- Approaching right on the dot

39:21.737 --> 39:22.982
just as they plotted it.

39:23.156 --> 39:26.157
What will that do to them?
What is it?

39:26.325 --> 39:29.860
I'm using sound against them.
Beyond the ultrasonic.

39:30.038 --> 39:32.114
It will stun them
and allow us time to leave.

39:32.290 --> 39:33.784
We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.366
Sound pitched that high
doesn't stun.

39:36.544 --> 39:40.376
It destroys. I remember
when we read in the text that it...

39:40.548 --> 39:43.170
I've gone beyond those texts, Irina.

39:43.343 --> 39:47.886
It's correct for you to be concerned,
but be assured also.

39:50.183 --> 39:53.517
We are in orbit over Eden,
Brother Sevrin.

39:54.688 --> 39:56.977
It does destroy.

39:58.317 --> 40:00.938
We cannot allow them
to come after us.

40:01.111 --> 40:05.191
It will not reach us in here.
I can control it all.

40:05.365 --> 40:08.900
I have adjusted it so that it will suspend
its effects after a few moments

40:09.078 --> 40:10.869
and allow us time to escape.

40:11.038 --> 40:14.822
Then after we've gone,
it will automatically reactivate.

40:16.377 --> 40:18.453
Rejoice, brethren.

40:18.629 --> 40:21.464
Soon we shall step together
into Eden.

40:48.118 --> 40:49.398
Spock.

40:55.417 --> 40:59.462
- It's all right, Spock. It's stopped.
- No captain, it hasn't stopped.

40:59.629 --> 41:01.587
It's gone beyond...

41:02.758 --> 41:04.750
Captain, they're using...

41:14.103 --> 41:15.930
Steppin' in to Eden

41:16.105 --> 41:18.014
Yea, brother

41:18.190 --> 41:19.850
Steppin' in to Eden

41:20.025 --> 41:21.935
Yea, brother

41:22.111 --> 41:26.109
No more trouble
In my body or my mind

41:26.282 --> 41:30.066
Gonna live like a king
On whatever I find

41:30.244 --> 41:33.945
Eat all the fruit
And throw away the rind

41:34.123 --> 41:38.785
Yea, brother

41:39.587 --> 41:41.876
Now we may leave.

41:53.143 --> 41:57.971
Captain, go. You must destroy the...

41:58.148 --> 42:02.976
- What is it?
- Ultrasonics. The panel.

42:26.594 --> 42:28.467
Kirk to Engineering.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.804
Bridge?

42:32.016 --> 42:33.807
Hangar deck?

42:36.979 --> 42:39.055
Kirk to Transporter Room.

42:41.359 --> 42:44.526
Kirk to Bridge.
Do you read me? Come in.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.103
Sulu here, captain.
What happened to us?

42:47.282 --> 42:49.405
- I heard a whistle and then...
- Never mind.

42:49.576 --> 42:51.153
Do we have control of the ship?

42:51.327 --> 42:53.949
No, sir. Control is in auxiliary.

42:54.122 --> 42:56.031
Can we break out of orbit
if we have to?

42:56.207 --> 42:57.405
I think so, sir.

42:57.584 --> 43:00.205
- Hangar Deck to Captain.
- Kirk here.

43:00.378 --> 43:02.371
Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts
has been taken.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.540
- We were all knocked out.
- Stand by.

43:04.716 --> 43:07.338
- You read any Romulans?
- Negative, captain.

43:07.511 --> 43:09.384
However, I am picking up
the shuttlecraft.

43:09.554 --> 43:12.092
- Where?
- It has landed.

43:12.265 --> 43:13.808
Except for those aboard the craft,

43:13.976 --> 43:16.680
I read no life at all,
either humanoid nor animal.

43:20.315 --> 43:23.566
Auxiliary control for Dr. McCoy.
Bones, are you all right?

43:23.736 --> 43:26.986
- Yes, Jim.
- Stand by, Transporter Room.

43:27.156 --> 43:30.157
- Full medical gear.
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.

43:30.326 --> 43:32.402
Do you wish
to open communications, sir?

43:32.578 --> 43:33.989
No.

43:34.830 --> 43:37.867
No, they tried to destroy us.
Let them think they succeeded.

43:38.042 --> 43:39.287
I want the coordinates zeroed in

43:39.460 --> 43:41.618
so that when we beam down
we won't be visible to them.

43:41.796 --> 43:43.670
Scotty, you have the conn.

43:43.840 --> 43:47.458
If any Romulans appear,
try to make them understand.

43:47.635 --> 43:50.838
I do not want to provoke combat.

43:51.014 --> 43:56.091
Mr. Spock. Mr. Chekov,
join us in the Transporter Room.

44:20.919 --> 44:25.712
Legends were true, captain.
A fantastically beautiful planet.

44:25.883 --> 44:27.460
Eden.

44:27.634 --> 44:30.256
Is this what they believed they'd find?

44:30.429 --> 44:31.627
Then I can understand.

44:36.060 --> 44:38.977
Spread out. Approach with caution.

44:42.608 --> 44:43.723
Dr. Sevrin...

44:50.241 --> 44:52.234
- What is it?
- The flower, sir.

44:52.410 --> 44:55.115
I touched it. It's like fire.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.000
It's burned.

45:03.713 --> 45:06.667
All this plant life is full of acid.

45:09.970 --> 45:11.927
Even the grass, Jim.

45:13.557 --> 45:16.973
- Will our clothing protect us?
- It should for a while.

45:17.644 --> 45:19.222
Captain.

45:37.706 --> 45:38.904
Bones?

45:41.460 --> 45:44.247
Poison. The fruit is deadly.

45:44.839 --> 45:47.045
His name was Adam.

45:53.306 --> 45:54.883
There's the shuttlecraft.

46:20.125 --> 46:22.912
Here. We'll help you.

46:33.639 --> 46:36.130
Dr. Sevrin. Bones.

46:39.269 --> 46:40.550
He should be beamed aboard, Jim.

46:40.729 --> 46:43.137
He needs more
than I can do for him here.

46:43.315 --> 46:45.107
- Spock to Enterprise.
- Enterprise here.

46:45.276 --> 46:47.102
Stand by to beam aboard
injured party.

46:47.278 --> 46:48.736
Medical team
to the Transporter Room.

46:48.904 --> 46:51.775
No. No, we're not leaving.

46:51.949 --> 46:54.191
We can help you aboard the ship.

46:54.368 --> 46:57.120
We're not leaving Eden, none of us.

46:57.288 --> 46:59.197
Be sensible, doctor.

46:59.373 --> 47:01.781
We're not leaving.

47:03.294 --> 47:05.334
Come back here, you fool.

47:11.010 --> 47:14.878
- Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself!
- Don't bite into that.

47:17.726 --> 47:20.513
It was so beautiful.

47:42.209 --> 47:45.744
- I have starbase now, captain.
- Alert them that we have the four.

47:45.921 --> 47:47.878
And we're ready to beam them down

47:48.048 --> 47:51.085
- and mark the incident closed.
- Aye, sir.

47:51.969 --> 47:54.258
Bridge to Transporter.
Scotty, are they there?

47:54.430 --> 47:56.719
Three of them, sir.
Expecting a fourth any minute.

47:56.891 --> 47:58.349
Stand by.

47:59.685 --> 48:03.849
Mr. Chekov, do you wish to attend?

48:04.023 --> 48:08.519
Captain, I wish first to apologise
for my conduct during this time.

48:08.694 --> 48:11.695
I did not maintain myself
under proper discipline.

48:11.864 --> 48:15.031
I endangered the ship
and its personnel by my conduct.

48:15.201 --> 48:18.451
I respectfully submit myself
for disciplinary action.

48:18.621 --> 48:20.828
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

48:21.708 --> 48:23.582
You did what you had to do.

48:23.752 --> 48:25.578
As did we all.

48:25.879 --> 48:27.871
Even your friends.

48:28.798 --> 48:30.458
You may go.

48:31.218 --> 48:32.878
Thank you, sir.

48:42.437 --> 48:44.347
I was coming to say goodbye.

48:44.523 --> 48:47.559
And I was coming
to say goodbye to you.

48:55.159 --> 48:56.701
Be incorrect.

48:56.869 --> 48:58.529
Occasionally.

48:58.704 --> 49:01.409
And you be correct.

49:02.166 --> 49:04.075
Occasionally.

49:04.627 --> 49:06.584
Miss Galliulin.

49:08.881 --> 49:14.089
It is my sincere wish that you
do not give up your search for Eden.

49:14.262 --> 49:17.713
I have no doubt
but that you will find it.

49:17.890 --> 49:19.966
Or make it yourselves.

49:20.143 --> 49:21.934
Thank you.

49:41.206 --> 49:45.500
We reach, Mr. Spock.
