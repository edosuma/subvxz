00:00.900 --> 00:04.333
- Our ship just came in, my son.

00:06.767 --> 00:10.500
What was your
involvement in the murder of
Kamale Lewis?

00:12.167 --> 00:13.200
- Don't know nothing about it.

00:13.233 --> 00:17.033
- My client has given you an
answer. Now move on.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.433
- Michael.

00:18.467 --> 00:19.267
Here, come.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.067
I got a special job for you
today.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.200
Hey, listen, make sure you don't
let me down, you know.

00:24.233 --> 00:24.733
- I won't.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.133
- Well, something's killed 'em.

00:31.433 --> 00:32.467
- He took my phone.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.033
- Dushane put the price up.

00:35.267 --> 00:38.167
-Blood, Dushane's the only one
that's got food right now.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.233
- We need to make some more
paper quick.

00:40.267 --> 00:43.767
- I lose money. 25 grand
minimum.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.400
- All right. Well, I'd better
go.

00:45.433 --> 00:47.367
I've got school.
- No, no, no.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.067
You're not going nowhere.

01:21.167 --> 01:23.067
Thinking of
riding on my dogs?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.667
No, you better not,

01:24.700 --> 01:25.533
I'll leave your head open

01:25.567 --> 01:27.533
Like windows when the
weather's hot

01:27.567 --> 01:29.367
No evidence for the federal

01:29.400 --> 01:31.800
Only when I leave the crime
scene I take the leathers off

01:31.833 --> 01:33.667
Rolling with the AK, hoping that
I catch a cunt.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.567
What is this?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.433
- I turn the 'matic on. I'll--

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
AK?

01:43.267 --> 01:46.733
- Blood, you ever been on the
road

01:46.767 --> 01:48.600
Cos trust me, I've been on the
road and I ain't never seen no

01:48.633 --> 01:51.200
AK-47 in my life, bruv.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.233
- Never.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.333
- Bruv, get in that room, get a
drink, man, go on.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.367
Big man's talking out here.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.133
So what you guys really think?

02:00.167 --> 02:02.067
- It's like, I ain't even
heard him before

02:02.100 --> 02:04.300
and I feel like I heard him
a million times.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.733
- Exactly.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.833
-You ain't showing me no love,
man.

02:07.867 --> 02:09.300
No love at all.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.800
- Look Tone, you called us.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.033
What's up? Talk to me, man.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.733
- Well, hear this, bruv.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.800
See this killing people for
money business?

02:16.833 --> 02:17.900
- Mm.

02:17.933 --> 02:20.567
- Don't really wanna be doing it
no more, you get me?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.233
I got my music now.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.167
I got my kids and stuff.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.033
Don't really like doing it
again, you feel me?

02:28.667 --> 02:31.167
- Well, don't do it.
- Relax.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.167
- Well, hear this.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.233
A guy came to see me last
week, yeah, offers me

02:35.267 --> 02:37.067
ten grand for a hit.
- Mm.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.300
- I told him no at first. But
then I remembered you guys are

02:39.333 --> 02:41.700
looking to make some money fast.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.567
So what I'm thinking is,
you do the hit,

02:44.600 --> 02:46.400
we split down the middle.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.267
- Well, what you doing
for your five?

02:48.300 --> 02:50.100
- I'm introducing the work,
innit?

02:50.133 --> 02:51.667
- We can find that work
ourselves.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.833
Keep the whole ten.

02:53.867 --> 02:54.833
This is niche, you know.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.733
Very specialized business.
Niche.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.767
- Look, you need the
money or what?

03:02.300 --> 03:06.333
We do it, we take nine, we give
you one.

03:06.367 --> 03:07.700
You ain't even gotta move off
the sofa.

03:08.733 --> 03:11.500
One.
- Come on, man. At least two.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.767
- One.

03:17.533 --> 03:20.600
All right, one, then, innit?
Sweet, Tone.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.500
- No hard feelings, you know.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.600
Tone comes round fast.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.300
Cheers, Tone.
Who is it, anyway?

03:28.333 --> 03:32.167
- Jermaine Newton, lives on
Clarence Road. You know him?

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
Yeah, couple more jobs
like this and we're on our way,
bruv.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.300
- Kamale, man.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.500
Going down.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.600
- So you know this Jermaine
geezer?

03:47.633 --> 03:49.067
Doors
closing.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.033
- Yeah. It's my cousin.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.767
- Dushane.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.300
Who did it?

04:22.700 --> 04:25.600
- Ain't gonna walk.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.833
- You'll walk.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.200
You gotta tell me what happened.

04:29.233 --> 04:31.300
What happened?

04:31.333 --> 04:33.600
- The... the...

04:33.633 --> 04:35.067
the Albanian.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.100
- Albanian.
- The Albanians took
the food, yeah?

04:40.133 --> 04:41.467
- Yeah.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.167
Joe, where can I find them?

05:02.267 --> 05:03.533
Gem!

05:04.333 --> 05:05.567
Gemel!

05:05.600 --> 05:07.367
Hey!

05:07.400 --> 05:08.433
School.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.167
School. Get up.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Now.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.567
I'm going to Ramsgate.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.233
Where's that?

05:37.267 --> 05:40.333
- Outside London.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.367
The rents are low.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.067
Are we gonna live there?

05:47.267 --> 05:48.400
- Maybe.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
And clean up that mess.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.667
- My dad wants us to move to
Ramsgate, innit?

05:55.700 --> 05:57.533
What for?

05:57.567 --> 06:00.333
- They're kicking him out of the
chippy, innit?

06:02.300 --> 06:05.033
- I don't wanna go to Ramsgate.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.833
- I don't blame you, bruv.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.767
- Hey.
- Don't leave me, bruv.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.533
Work hard. Study.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.400
Enjoy yourself.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.500
- I sent you a message,
come to my shop.

06:21.533 --> 06:22.700
You no come.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.167
Many messages.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.467
- They never came through.

06:30.133 --> 06:30.767
Yeah.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.700
- Yeah.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.500
- Put this in your locker.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.400
Don't look inside. Understand?

06:38.433 --> 06:41.533
- I can't take this.
- Seven o'clock, you take it
here.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.333
Give to a Chinese guy.

06:43.367 --> 06:45.600
Don't be late, OK?

06:45.633 --> 06:51.633
Hey, come to the shop after, OK?

06:51.667 --> 06:53.367
You all right?

06:55.567 --> 06:57.367
You actually think
they're gonna catch the killer?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.267
- They ain't never gonna catch
who done Kamale.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.633
- They got ways, man,
believe me.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.667
They got ways.

07:08.533 --> 07:12.133
- Two on two.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.533
- Wait over there.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.400
Go get it.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.733
Ay, yo! 5-0! 5-0!

07:32.767 --> 07:35.300
- Hey, feds.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.800
Why are they here?

07:36.833 --> 07:40.200
Trust me, man, they
should be catching criminals or
something.

07:43.067 --> 07:46.267
- Good, yeah. Cool.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.133
Two on two.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.733
- Careful, man. There's feds
there.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.467
Hey, I tell you what.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.433
You know, my cousin's working in
the shop today.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.333
- Yeah. He said we can take
anything we want.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.600
- Let's go, then.

08:10.633 --> 08:13.600
I'm telling you,
any trainers you want, man.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.233
Shop.

08:18.267 --> 08:19.300
We'll be back in a
bit.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.100
- Alright. Hurry up, though.
Don't take the piss.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.500
Yeah.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.600
- You gotta tell someone.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.267
- My dad don't care about me
except when he's angry.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.300
If I told him, he wouldn't kill
Vincent, he'd kill me.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.500
You gonna come with me to his
shop later?

08:44.533 --> 08:46.667
- No, man. I got my trial, man.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.333
You know that.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.433
- Hey, wagwan.
- Wagwan.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.833
Where them youngers?

09:11.867 --> 09:13.800
- Feds come round here, innit,
so they fucked off.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.533
There ain't no feds
here, fam.

09:15.567 --> 09:18.700
Shout dem, man. They should be
working.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.367
- All right, sir.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.533
It's a waste of paper, man.

09:30.567 --> 09:33.100
- Fam, they ain't gonna let that
go, you know.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.567
- They can put them things up.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.133
They ain't got nothing. The case
ain't going nowhere. You get me?

09:38.167 --> 09:40.533
Oi. You found out where them men
are?

09:40.567 --> 09:43.300
- Yeah, they've got a warehouse
near the canal.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.700
- All right.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.233
I'll check it.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600

09:53.333 --> 09:54.133
Yo.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.833
Yo, fam. Where the fuck's my
food?

09:55.867 --> 09:59.333
I gave you the money for the
food and I still don't see none.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.667
And don't talk to the mandem
starving, blood. Wagwan?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.300
- Bruv, you're gonna get your
two boxes.

10:05.233 --> 10:06.433
- Yeah.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.367
- Blood, right now I'm hearing
you got problems picking up

10:08.400 --> 10:10.700
and I hear you got problems with
the Jakes over Kamale.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.067
- Yeah, that's gone away.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.600
- What do you mean, that's gone
away?

10:14.633 --> 10:17.267
- All I'm saying is, yeah, the
reason there ain't been no wars,
fam,

10:17.300 --> 10:18.767
is cos of your rep, innit?

10:18.800 --> 10:23.200
But once that goes, everything

10:23.233 --> 10:24.767
Food, yeah?

10:29.733 --> 10:31.567
- Fuck them pussies.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.567
- Hey, that's my cousin, Rufus.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.633
Yeah.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.033
- Um, Can I get the high tops in
size five?

10:54.067 --> 10:55.367
- Yeah.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.733
- Wait here.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.633
- The manager's looking at us.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.133
- Don't worry. Rufus will sort
us out.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.100
- Yeah, man.
Any trainers you want.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.400
- We won't.

11:08.433 --> 11:09.367
- Yeah.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.400
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.567
- Oi!

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
- Move, man!

11:37.233 --> 11:38.100
- Get off me!

11:38.133 --> 11:38.833
Get off me!

11:38.867 --> 11:39.700
- Keep still.
- Get off me!

11:39.733 --> 11:42.067
- Keep still. Just relax, mate.
Relax!

11:51.100 --> 11:53.400
- Crack cocaine and heroin.

11:53.433 --> 11:55.767
That's big boys' stuff.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.033
Somebody give you these
drugs to sell?

12:01.067 --> 12:02.033
- No comment.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.633
- Look, this is a very serious
crime, Michael.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.600
Possession of class A drugs with
intent to supply.

12:05.633 --> 12:06.800
What, do you wanna go to prison?

12:06.833 --> 12:08.667
- No.
- Well, that's where you're
heading.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.467
I think that somebody's given
you these drugs

12:12.500 --> 12:13.633
and they've told you to sell
them.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.800
- It's not just you, either.
Your mum's in big trouble.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.800
Yeah, you've
been truanting.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.333
You and your little brother.
We've checked up.

12:19.367 --> 12:20.667
Both of you, you're never in
school.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.367
- Mums go to prison for that.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.233
I see you
live in Summerhouse.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.833
Don't look at him. Look at me.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.500
Someone in the Summerhouse
gang,

12:27.533 --> 12:29.667
did they give you these drugs
and tell you to sell them?

12:29.700 --> 12:30.933
- No.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.033
- So these are your drugs you're
selling? - They're not my drugs.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.800
Is that what you're saying?

12:34.833 --> 12:35.933
- They don't... They're not
mine.

12:35.967 --> 12:39.300
- Well, they must be, because no
one gave them to you--

12:39.333 --> 12:40.367
- I'm not saying that
- So they must be yours.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.367
- They're not mine.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.267
- They're not my drugs.

12:42.300 --> 12:46.033
- Dushane's!
- All right, OK. Dushane.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.067
Yeah, yeah, course you do,

13:19.100 --> 13:23.800
so you wouldn't wanna get your
mum in any trouble, would you?

13:23.833 --> 13:25.000
- No.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.567
- Why did you have this on you,
Michael?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.100
- I just picked it up.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.700
Did you...

13:40.733 --> 13:43.400
Do you know something
about this?

13:44.633 --> 13:46.367
- You wouldn't wanna get your
mum and your little brother

13:46.400 --> 13:48.600
in trouble, would you?

13:48.633 --> 13:49.633
- No.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.633
- Do you know something about
this murder?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.500
- I only saw...

13:58.633 --> 14:00.200
I was outside the house.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.333
- Yeah.

14:05.367 --> 14:07.200
- The one in LF.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.100
Good.
Don't you make money?

14:16.133 --> 14:17.133
Answer the man.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.333
Don't you make money?

14:18.367 --> 14:19.367
Yeah.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.100
So why the fuck you
stealing trainers?

14:22.567 --> 14:26.167
- This idiot took the youths to
steal trainers, fam, got Michael
nicked.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.167
- Took Michael to steal
trainers, yeah?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.667
You took Michael to steal
trainers?

14:30.700 --> 14:33.167
Whose idea was that?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.333
- It was mine, but my cousin
said it wouldn't be a problem.

14:35.367 --> 14:39.267
- What have I told you about
stealing, though?

14:39.300 --> 14:42.733
- Uh... Don't do nothing. It's
gonna attract attention.

14:43.833 --> 14:47.133
- Don't do noth...
- Fucking idiot. I swear down.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.300
Where's Michael now?

14:48.333 --> 14:49.367
- I don't know. In the cells.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.267
- So how come Michael got nicked
and you lot never?

14:52.300 --> 14:53.633
- Me and R-Marni got away.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.667
You got away, yeah?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.167
What have I told you about
family?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.700
You don't ever leave your family
when they in trouble, you
fucking fool.

14:59.733 --> 15:05.300
Where's your phone, man? Give it
to Shaheed.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.133
Those the trainers you nicked,
yeah?

15:07.167 --> 15:11.100
Yeah, take them off as well and
give them to Shaheed.

15:11.133 --> 15:14.433
You not fucking hear what I
said? Take off the trainers!

15:14.467 --> 15:15.733
Fucking twat.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.600
Idiot.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.000
Hurry up.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.033
Come, man.

15:27.433 --> 15:30.267
- You lot making me look like
some fucking dickhead.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.067
- All this, pubs and that,

15:53.100 --> 15:54.767
is it all necessary?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.100
- Trust me.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.800
- Plus he is my cousin, anyway.
I can't just fucking...

16:00.833 --> 16:03.200
kill him without talking to him.
You know what I'm saying?

16:03.233 --> 16:05.467
Suppose so.
Yo.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.633
Is this him?
What's happening?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.700
Yo.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.333
- Fucking hell.

16:11.367 --> 16:12.767
That Sully?

16:12.800 --> 16:13.867
What you saying, cuz?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.567
- Yeah, man, I'm good.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.267
That's my mate Mike.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.133
Jermaine, yeah?

16:19.167 --> 16:20.000
- Cool. Nice, man.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.800
What you doing round here, you
mad man?

16:23.667 --> 16:24.667
What?

16:28.233 --> 16:30.067
- Sit down, man.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.733
- Mm.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.500
Look, I'll be straight.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.233
Someone's put a hit out on you,
Jermaine.

16:38.267 --> 16:41.100
You're winding me up.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.100
Serious?

16:48.133 --> 16:49.400
Mm.

16:49.433 --> 16:52.767
Yeah, man. Me and Mike got asked
to do it.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.633
It's no joke.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.567
- That's mad, fam.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.833
- Got any ideas who could be
behind it?

17:07.767 --> 17:09.067
- It don't go like that, man.

17:09.100 --> 17:12.367
- You must know who wants you
dead, bruv.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.533
- Well...

17:14.567 --> 17:16.067
I'm trying to think...

17:16.100 --> 17:20.733
Obviously there's a couple that
would like to try a ting, but
doing it...

17:20.767 --> 17:22.767
Not even. You get me?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.567
- Offered us 20 grand.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.500
- Mm.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.633
- Fucking hell.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.567
- Someone wants you dead, man.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
- Mm.

17:33.667 --> 17:37.433
Aight, well, look, thanks for
coming and telling man, innit?

17:37.467 --> 17:39.267
I respect that.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.267
Obviously you're not gonna
forget man for that.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.067
When I got a little ting
running,

17:43.100 --> 17:46.100
just bring man in. You get me?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.833
- I don't see nothing in your
hand, though.

17:49.433 --> 17:50.667
- To reverse the hit.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.800
- Don't piss me off, Sully.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.367
- You don't want me to do that
for you?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.267
- This is something a cousin's
meant to be coming and telling
man for free.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.133
What're you talking about?

17:59.367 --> 18:01.200
You're being serious?

18:02.767 --> 18:06.200
Look, you've done man a little
favor, yeah?

18:06.233 --> 18:07.633
I said thank you, innit?

18:07.667 --> 18:09.667
I'll make sure you're good.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.300
A little favor?

18:13.333 --> 18:14.467
I want the full 20.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.167
You know what, Sully?

18:16.200 --> 18:17.433
You can fuck off, then, innit?

18:18.267 --> 18:20.567
Hey, Mike, show him what you
got.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.833
- Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.767
How you gonna do this to your
own blood, fam?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah

18:28.067 --> 18:31.000
you might be my own blood, but I
ain't never liked you, Jermaine.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.033
- Sully, come on. This ain't
even on, fam.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.833
- Shut up.
- Just keep walking. Keep
walking.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.767
- This is a joke ting.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.633
This is long, man.
Keep it moving.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.167
Oi, oi.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.500
Oi, that's that
fucking kid.

18:47.533 --> 18:48.800
Oi, Mike, put him in the car.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.300
- Sully, what the fuck you
doing?

18:50.333 --> 18:51.400
Huh?

18:52.233 --> 18:54.500
Yeah, it's me.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.033
Where's my fucking phone?

18:56.067 --> 18:56.967
Hm?
- I ain't got it.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.567
- Thought you weren't gonna see
me again?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.067
Where is it? I'll fucking hit
you, you know.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.133
Argh!

19:01.167 --> 19:01.800
- Did no one tell you
it's wrong to rob people?

19:01.833 --> 19:03.400
- Sully!

19:03.433 --> 19:04.800
Sul!
- Fucking hell, Mike.

19:04.833 --> 19:07.133
Fuck. Fuck.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.700
Hey, you bitch.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.800
Don't fucking make me run again.

19:12.833 --> 19:13.500
Move!

19:13.533 --> 19:14.567
- I know...
- Fucking move!

19:14.600 --> 19:15.567
- Sully, man.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.033
Fam...

19:17.067 --> 19:18.633
Fucking move. Shut up.

19:18.667 --> 19:19.633
I know.
What did I say?

19:19.667 --> 19:23.067
- I know. I done shit, blood.
Sorry. Sorry.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.433
- Get in.
Oi!

19:24.467 --> 19:26.067
I've got your phone, dickhead!

19:26.100 --> 19:27.633
- Fucking prick.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.367
Which house
is it?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.200
- It's that one.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.233
That's Kayla
Thomas's house.

19:54.467 --> 19:58.567
That's where they went in to get
Kamale, yeah?

19:58.600 --> 20:02.700
Right, listen, we're gonna be
acting on the information that
you've given us.

20:02.733 --> 20:05.167
You understand?
- I wanna go home.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.700
- You need protection, Michael.
- I don't need protection.

20:07.733 --> 20:10.733
I told you everything I know. I
just wanna go home.

20:13.267 --> 20:18.667
- Look, my personal mobile
number is written on the back of
there, yeah?

20:18.700 --> 20:24.267
Now, if you get frightened, you
call that number, yeah?

20:28.233 --> 20:29.767
Go on, go on! Five
seconds! Come on!

20:29.800 --> 20:31.833
Keep going.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.633
Sprint to the back of the queue
and reset.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.400
Legs up. Go, go, go!

20:35.433 --> 20:36.333
Next!

20:36.367 --> 20:38.267
Just the one foot,
that's it.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.733
Good, good. Next!

21:01.767 --> 21:04.433
Sprint to the back and reset.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.667
Keep it going with the one foot,
left foot. Well done.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.833
- Look, I need to contact the
landlords.

21:29.867 --> 21:33.267
OK, whatever, the church
commissioners.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.633
This is urgent.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.400
- Well, I still wanna see
someone.

21:42.433 --> 21:45.367
And you will call me back?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.233
Thank you. Bye.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.200
What you been up to?

21:51.500 --> 21:54.267
- Oh, the trial.

21:54.300 --> 21:56.367
How did it go?

21:56.400 --> 21:57.467
- Yeah, it went good.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.633
Did you get in?

21:59.667 --> 22:01.567
- Said they'll let me know.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.433
- Well, how do you think you
did?

22:03.467 --> 22:06.467
- I was all right. I think I was
one of the best there.

22:07.267 --> 22:08.433
- That's great.

22:08.467 --> 22:11.400
- I got everything crossed for
you, babe.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.167
- You'll never guess who these
church commissioners are.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.167
Only the prime minister, the
Lord Chancellor and the
archbishop.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.367
They thought I was having a
laugh when I said I wanted an
appointment.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.167
- Well, it doesn't matter how
important these people are.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.700
They're still gonna dash us out,
innit?

22:27.567 --> 22:30.367
- Not if I've got anything to do
with it.

22:51.433 --> 22:53.333
- Yeah.

22:54.433 --> 22:55.433
- No.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.233
- Not really. Sometimes.

23:00.267 --> 23:02.033
- Here, you smoke.

23:02.067 --> 23:04.067
- Thanks.

23:09.133 --> 23:11.467
- You owe money.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.567
I say you go, you go.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.800
I say go there, you go there.

23:15.833 --> 23:18.100
I say take this, what do you do?

23:18.133 --> 23:19.033
- Take it.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.033
- I call you, you come. You
understand?

23:21.067 --> 23:25.800
- Well, how long is this all
gonna go on--

23:25.833 --> 23:27.600
- No.

23:27.633 --> 23:28.733
- No.

23:28.767 --> 23:30.533
- OK, then, I own you.

23:30.567 --> 23:32.233
You're, you're mine.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.600
You do as I tell you, OK?

23:34.633 --> 23:37.033
Now, don't worry. Don't worry.

23:37.067 --> 23:41.067
I pay you. I pay you. OK?

23:41.100 --> 23:43.433
One, two, three...

23:44.267 --> 23:46.433
You earn good money.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.500
So when I call you,
what do you do?

23:48.533 --> 23:50.033
- Come.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.567
- Now you can go.

24:38.733 --> 24:41.400
- So you finally got a free
evening, then.

24:43.100 --> 24:46.200
- I like to spend my time
usefully.

24:46.233 --> 24:49.533
- You need to relax sometimes,
you know.

24:49.567 --> 24:50.700
Can I get you a drink?

24:50.733 --> 24:52.400
- I don't drink.

24:54.700 --> 24:58.633
- If you saw me drunk, falling
over, talking loud,

24:58.667 --> 25:01.533
would you really think,
'That's the person I wanna
trust with my life?

25:01.567 --> 25:03.567
'With my freedom'?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
- Well, you could do it in
private.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.667
- But then it wouldn't
be any fun.

25:15.433 --> 25:17.233
So...

25:17.267 --> 25:20.633
girls like to buy you clothes.

25:20.667 --> 25:23.400
They're nice. The clothes.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.400
- I'd like to buy you
something nice.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.600
- Just to show my appreciation
for what you done.

25:30.633 --> 25:33.300
- Maybe I've got expensive
taste.

25:38.367 --> 25:41.567
- And how would you pay for my
expensive taste?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.133
- With money.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.533
- But you don't have any income.

25:45.567 --> 25:48.267
That's what you told the police.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.700
- I don't know why you're
bringing up the police.

25:50.733 --> 25:53.567
Now, I'd say you were...

25:53.600 --> 25:56.167
a size eight?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.200
Yeah.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.433
You sure you don't want a drink?

26:00.467 --> 26:03.800
- I've already answered that
question. Now move on.

26:10.300 --> 26:13.267
- So what do you do to enjoy
yourself?

26:47.167 --> 26:50.533
* I ain't been paid and I ain't
got a lot

26:50.567 --> 26:55.033
* But it's us against whatever
babe

26:55.067 --> 26:58.400
* Us against whatever babe

27:12.733 --> 27:14.167
All right, so, listen,

27:14.200 --> 27:15.633
you know the deal, yeah?

27:15.667 --> 27:18.367
You don't give your brother no
names.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.333
Don't tell him about shit that's
happened today.

27:22.367 --> 27:23.300
Bruv, you get that?

27:23.333 --> 27:24.500
- Blood, I fucking heard you.

27:24.533 --> 27:26.733
- Don't fucking make it hard.

27:26.767 --> 27:29.600
This is happening whether you
like it or not, bruv.

27:29.633 --> 27:32.300
It's ringing. Do it.

27:35.467 --> 27:37.100
- Yo, Rafe.
Yo.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.567
Yeah,
it's me.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.200
I need you to do me a favor
still.

27:40.233 --> 27:42.033
- Mm, yeah, yeah.

27:42.067 --> 27:43.700
I got a little debt I need to
run back.

27:43.733 --> 27:45.467
I need to sell my car, yeah?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.067
Yeah, I need to sell it quick,
though.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.600
- You want me to sell your car
for you?

27:48.633 --> 27:49.700
- Like tonight.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.500
How the fuck am I gonna do that?
- Well, as soon as poss, then.

27:55.433 --> 27:56.733
Yeah, blood, I know, innit?

27:56.767 --> 27:58.267
As long as it's quick.

27:59.533 --> 28:02.633
- Can you just make that happen
for me, please, Rafe, I beg.

28:02.667 --> 28:05.067
- All right, yeah.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.100
- Yeah, call me.

28:06.133 --> 28:06.933
- I'll call you.

28:06.967 --> 28:08.433
- Yeah, call me when you do,
yeah?

28:08.467 --> 28:11.467
All right, cool. See you.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.733
Look, why don't you just take
the car, then, Sully, yeah?

28:18.767 --> 28:22.033
It's worth 20, innit? It's worth
more than 20, actually, yeah?
I'll just...

28:22.067 --> 28:25.333
I'll give you the keys, I'll
sign over the log book, do what
you want and--

28:25.367 --> 28:27.367
- I want the paper, Jermaine.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.200
- Blood, well, you're gonna have
to wait, then.

28:31.233 --> 28:36.267
Look, just get man some food at
least, cuz, I'm fucking starving
now.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.767
Yeah, come, let's eat.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.633
Who's gonna go get it?

28:49.567 --> 28:50.600
Yo.

28:50.633 --> 28:53.467
- Oh, so you have got my phone,
you little fucker.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.833
I like your place.

28:57.867 --> 29:00.233
- It's small.

29:00.267 --> 29:02.100
Where do you live?

29:02.133 --> 29:05.200
- I've got a flat on the canal.

29:05.233 --> 29:06.600
- But not in your name.

29:06.633 --> 29:09.133
- Yeah, but it's still mine,
though.

29:09.167 --> 29:13.133
- Legally speaking, I'm not sure
you're on firm ground there.

29:13.167 --> 29:15.833
- Yeah, well, legally speaking
ain't everything, babe.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.367
- It's the law.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.267
- It's a law.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.833
- Doesn't it bother you,

29:20.867 --> 29:22.400
having no security?

29:22.433 --> 29:23.967
- I have security.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.567
- You don't have a property in
your name. You don't have a car
in your name.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.067
I mean, what do you have to show
for all your...

29:30.100 --> 29:31.400
efforts?

29:31.433 --> 29:34.633
I'm from
Summerhouse, babe.

29:34.667 --> 29:39.567
Where from the day you're born
they tell you you can't have
nothing.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.100
I think I'm doing all right.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.333
Me.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.433
- Come in, then. Come in, man.

29:59.467 --> 30:01.767
You better have my fucking
change.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
Yes, food.

30:11.867 --> 30:14.533
Yo.

30:14.567 --> 30:15.833
I need the toilet.

30:15.867 --> 30:17.367
- Mike, take him to it.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.233
- Fuck him. Let's eat.

30:29.233 --> 30:31.133
Come, let's go.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.167
Upstairs on the right.

30:38.733 --> 30:42.400
- Fucking lucky I don't shoot
you dead, you know that?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
Have some food, man.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.367
- So do it, then.

30:56.267 --> 30:57.567
- Do what you've gotta do.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.167
- Move from the toilet.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.100
- Just piss.

31:01.133 --> 31:05.567
I said move
from the fucking toilet, blood.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.767
Whatever.
- Get on with it.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.367
Argh!

31:09.400 --> 31:11.500
Ah!

31:11.533 --> 31:13.800
Sully! Sul!

31:13.833 --> 31:15.267
- Hey!

31:15.300 --> 31:17.033
For fuck's sake! Oi!

31:17.067 --> 31:18.533
Aaah!

31:18.567 --> 31:20.033
Fuck.

31:20.067 --> 31:23.533
Fucking run, yeah? Trying to
fucking run?

31:23.567 --> 31:25.500
Fucking idiot.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.267
Fucking dickhead.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.833
Why don't you just
miss work today?

31:29.867 --> 31:31.200
- I don't do that.

31:31.233 --> 31:33.500
- Come on, man, take that off.

31:33.533 --> 31:35.667
Babe, come on.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.800
- You know, when I first saw
you, I thought,

31:37.833 --> 31:40.100
'He's more intelligent than my
normal clients.'

31:41.833 --> 31:44.467
- Actually, yeah, it is.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.567
But then I thought, 'If he's so
intelligent,

31:47.600 --> 31:50.167
what's he doing in a police
station?'

31:50.200 --> 31:52.033
- You never heard of miscarriage
of justice?

31:52.067 --> 31:54.067
- What's he doing on the streets

31:54.100 --> 31:56.100
running a bunch of kids?

31:59.400 --> 32:02.767
- When I was at school, my
headmaster took me into his
office one day

32:02.800 --> 32:05.367
and he told me, 'You won't
accept anyone telling you what
to do.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.300
'You're disrespectful to the
teachers.

32:07.333 --> 32:10.133
'You ain't ever gonna achieve
anything in life.'

32:10.167 --> 32:12.233
But ask anyone in Summerhouse.

32:12.267 --> 32:13.700
They know my name.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.333
They know who I am.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.167
- Dushane, I like people who
come from nothing and make

32:18.200 --> 32:20.333
something out of themselves.

32:20.367 --> 32:23.200
People who want more than what
we've been told we can have.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.367
- Yeah well, some of us have to
work hard for what we have.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.833
- Look, my dad left when I was
one year old.

32:27.867 --> 32:31.067
My mum, she can barely read or
write.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.400
I went to school, put my head
down and I worked hard.

32:33.433 --> 32:38.067
I put myself through college,
working in bars, restaurants,

32:38.100 --> 32:40.800
babysitting, anything.

32:40.833 --> 32:43.300
Do you get what I'm saying?

32:43.333 --> 32:45.367
Summerhouse is a shithole.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.133
You're the king of a shithole,
Dushane.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.233
Good for you.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.600
Did they beat you up?

33:16.633 --> 33:17.833
- Yeah, but I didn't say
nothing.

33:17.867 --> 33:18.733
You all right, fam?

33:22.333 --> 33:25.333
- Last night. They let me out
with a caution.

33:25.367 --> 33:27.267
- Yo. Wagwan.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.633
- Wagwan.

33:55.833 --> 33:58.033
- So you've been nicked now,
yeah?

33:58.067 --> 34:00.167
Now you know how it feels.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.567
No big deal?

34:02.600 --> 34:04.433
- No big deal.

34:05.300 --> 34:08.033
- So what did they ask you,
then?

34:08.067 --> 34:10.633
- Who was in the shop with me,
what their names was,

34:10.667 --> 34:12.200
stuff like that, innit?

34:13.767 --> 34:15.067
- I said 'no comment' like
you told me.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.467
- Good. Good.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.033
You're my best soldier.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.667
Hey, look who's home, fam.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.767
- Yeah.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.800
Hold that.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.533
Go and do your ting, man.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.400
- All right, cool.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.000
All right.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.267
I checked out that Albanian
place still.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.267
- Yeah.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.000
- I think it's time we paid them
a visit, fam.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.433
So what you saying?
Did you get the shoes?

34:54.467 --> 34:56.800
Yeah, I got them, but
Dushane took them off me.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.567
I had to walk home barefoot and
everything.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
No socks?

35:02.633 --> 35:05.467
- No, I had socks.
- Oh, OK.

35:07.733 --> 35:10.500
- You lot, I'm sorry about
taking you stealing, innit?

35:10.533 --> 35:11.567
Dushane was like--

35:11.600 --> 35:14.333
- I have never ever seen him so
pissed.

35:14.367 --> 35:17.367
- I know, but he loves you,
innit?

35:17.400 --> 35:19.233
Was you scared in the police
station?

35:19.267 --> 35:21.200
- No. No big deal.

35:21.233 --> 35:25.133
Just asked me questions about
school, stuff like that like.

35:25.167 --> 35:27.167
Just chatting about shit.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.667
Ten on ten?

35:29.700 --> 35:33.467
You got 100?

35:33.500 --> 35:35.167
Give it to him.

35:38.567 --> 35:41.533
We ain't got that much here, so
he's gonna have to go get it.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.400
Wait over there.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.733
Yeah.

36:02.767 --> 36:06.200
Mm. How much you want?

36:06.233 --> 36:08.400
Yeah?

36:08.433 --> 36:09.767
- Ten on ten.
All right, cool.

36:12.067 --> 36:14.100
Some ignorant youth.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.467
Next time say 'wagwan'
first, yeah?

36:17.367 --> 36:19.200
- Get that paper...

36:38.500 --> 36:41.033
What you doing, man?
Get off me, man!

36:41.833 --> 36:43.133
Yo!

36:43.167 --> 36:45.500
What happened, man?

36:46.833 --> 36:48.433
Did he take the food?

36:48.467 --> 36:51.300
- Yeah.
Oh, shit, man.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.633
For real?

36:52.667 --> 36:53.667
- That youth is dead, blood.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.233
- Ten on ten, man.

36:58.267 --> 36:59.267
- Fuck.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.333
Don't worry, man.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.300
- Fucking morphine.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.333
- Here, mate.

37:26.067 --> 37:30.733
Joe, how did these Albanians
even know about this shipment,
mate?

37:30.767 --> 37:35.267
- I haven't a fucking clue how
they knew.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.200
You'd better believe me on that.

37:37.233 --> 37:39.400
- I believe you.

37:39.433 --> 37:40.500
We've gotta get our food back,
though, man.

37:40.533 --> 37:42.667
I'm not gonna let these fuckers
get away with this.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.633
- Let it go, Dushane.

37:44.667 --> 37:47.233
Those fuckers are killers.

37:47.267 --> 37:51.433
- If they're killers, why aren't
you dead?

38:29.467 --> 38:30.633
Mum?

38:33.133 --> 38:34.800
I got you these.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.700
I love you.
You know that?

39:24.867 --> 39:26.333
Do you want Mr.
Elephant?

39:26.367 --> 39:27.367
No.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.367
Yeah? What about
penguin?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.733
- No.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.233
- No.

39:36.267 --> 39:38.367
- Why don't you try saying yes
one of these days?

39:38.400 --> 39:41.700
Say yes.
- No.

39:43.833 --> 39:44.633
- No.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.600
The
monkey.

39:46.633 --> 39:47.800
- Yes!

39:47.833 --> 39:49.700
- There you go.

39:49.733 --> 39:52.500
- Monkey!
- Give me a kiss.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.467
That's from me.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.333
That's from Mum.

39:56.367 --> 39:58.567
- Yo. It's time to go.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.700
It's the mummy
monkey.

40:00.733 --> 40:03.567
- Come, give her a kiss, fam.
The Albanians can wait.

40:06.233 --> 40:09.267
Come on.
Yes, Mummy.

40:21.133 --> 40:22.367
Nobody wants you to
kiss them.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.333
- Shut your mouth.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.233
- She don't like you, blood.
She's got taste.

40:25.267 --> 40:27.800
What you laughing
at, man?

40:27.833 --> 40:29.267
Whatever. Come.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.667
We're going to the
shop.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.433
Yes, we are.
- I'll see you in a bit.

40:33.833 --> 40:36.100
Daddy's going to do
some stuff.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.200
We can play.
I want to play with the
toys.

40:38.233 --> 40:39.233
Which one?

40:49.200 --> 40:50.133
I swear, Ra'Nell,

40:50.167 --> 40:53.200
it's like I'm Vincent's slave or
something.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.500
- Man he could tell you to do
anything

40:55.533 --> 40:57.167
and you have to do it?

40:58.333 --> 41:01.000
Yeah, bruv. Maybe
Ramsgate ain't so bad.

41:10.633 --> 41:11.600
- It's my mum.

41:11.633 --> 41:15.800
Gonna have to call you later.

41:17.133 --> 41:18.500
- Gem.

41:18.533 --> 41:19.433
He's moving to Ramsgate.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.600
- Cos of how cheap it is there.

41:23.833 --> 41:27.133
- You see what I'm talking
about?

41:27.167 --> 41:31.167
They are ripping this community
apart.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.433
Maybe we deserve it.

41:46.167 --> 41:48.233
- Detective Constable Mark Leko,
Metropolitan Police.

41:48.267 --> 41:49.633
This is my colleague, DC
Trovell.

41:51.867 --> 41:53.067
- No.

41:53.100 --> 41:54.533
- How long have you lived here,
sir?

41:54.567 --> 41:56.200
- Uh, four months.

41:56.233 --> 41:59.067
- We have a warrant to search
this house. Thank you.

42:14.133 --> 42:15.700
For fuck's sake.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.600
Danny Waterhouse has died.

42:17.633 --> 42:21.467
Only 41 as well. That's fucking
young, man.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.400
I swear every week someone I
know has died.

42:23.433 --> 42:25.267
- I got a theory about that.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.467
So do I. What's
your theory?

42:27.500 --> 42:30.167
You ready for this?

42:30.200 --> 42:32.467
The government.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.433
They're putting stuff in the
food.

42:34.467 --> 42:38.433
But only the food people
like you and me are eating.

42:38.467 --> 42:41.667
That's what's killing us.

42:41.700 --> 42:43.033
Fact.

42:43.067 --> 42:44.267
- What's the government putting
in the food?

42:44.300 --> 42:46.833
How are they getting the stuff
in there in the first place?

42:46.867 --> 42:49.700
How do they actually do it, bro?

42:51.567 --> 42:54.367
You seen that film,
yeah, Capricorn One?

42:54.400 --> 42:55.667
Jesus!

42:55.700 --> 42:58.667
Your brother better be selling
that fucking car.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.500
You
better watch your mouth, cos
I'll break your fucking jaw!

43:01.533 --> 43:05.667
And that's why she's
walking around with a fucking
cage around her mouth.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.400
Yo, Rafe.

43:07.433 --> 43:09.533
When'd you last talk to your
brother?

43:09.567 --> 43:12.633
Today. Selling his
car for him. Why?

43:12.667 --> 43:14.333
- You see him or talk to him on
the phone?

43:14.367 --> 43:16.400
- Spoke to him on the phone.
Why?

43:16.433 --> 43:17.633
- He's been kidnapped, cuz.

43:17.667 --> 43:19.267
- What the fuck you mean,
kidnapped?

43:19.300 --> 43:20.333
- A black and white team.

43:21.067 --> 43:23.067
- Jam, bruv. I know where he is.

43:37.633 --> 43:43.100
Albanian's got a
fucking brothel house next door,
fam.

43:43.133 --> 43:46.600
He's going in for some pussy,
man.

43:46.633 --> 43:48.033
- How much would you pay for
that ting?

43:48.067 --> 43:51.067
She's gotta
pay me, blood.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.800
- Looks like they got a couple
men up in there still.

43:57.833 --> 44:01.300
Look. There's more.

44:01.333 --> 44:04.333
I'm starting to lose count out
here, blood.

44:06.267 --> 44:10.233
Some big fucking
Albanians.

44:10.267 --> 44:12.400
- Yo, 'Shane.

44:12.433 --> 44:15.167
Might be an idea to come back
here another night with some
more men.

44:17.833 --> 44:19.167
'Shane.
- Yo.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.700
What d'you wanna do?

44:22.733 --> 44:25.233
- Fuck it. We need to hit 'em
hard.

44:25.267 --> 44:28.100
We need to think about this ting
properly.

44:38.267 --> 44:40.267
- Too early to say.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.300
- We need to find Kayla.

44:43.467 --> 44:46.133
If Kayla talks, yeah,
you know we're fucked, innit?

44:46.167 --> 44:47.367
Oi!

44:47.400 --> 44:48.633
Lay off my friend! Do you
understand me?

44:48.667 --> 44:51.800
- Have you heard them stories
about Rafe?

44:51.833 --> 44:53.367
I ain't gonna let that happen to
you.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.633
- Yo, feds!

44:54.667 --> 44:56.200
Where you gonna go,
Mike?

44:56.233 --> 44:58.233
If you go out there, Rafe will
get you.
