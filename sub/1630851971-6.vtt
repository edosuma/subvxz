00:02.176 --> 00:04.482
<i>- Previously on
"Paris in Love"...</i>

00:04.526 --> 00:06.223
I'm getting
really stressed out.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.746
Everyone's telling me you need,
like, a year to plan a wedding,

00:07.790 --> 00:09.792
and it's literally in,
like--I don't even know.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.098
Like, a few months.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.664
- It's getting harder
and harder

00:12.708 --> 00:14.144
to have the wedding
of your dreams.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.407
- You have to, like,
be an adult and deal.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.192
- I've been traveling.
My schedule's insane.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.020
<i>Like, I can't even
think straight.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:21.804
Oh, my God.
I'm so stressed.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.545
I just figured out
who the I was,

00:23.588 --> 00:24.807
like, a year ago.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.374
But I know it's not him.
It's me.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.724
- Don't you think we should
bring our future kids here?

00:28.767 --> 00:31.118
Bring up children in a way
that feels normal.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.511
Otherwise they're gonna be
little monsters.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.947
- Are you, like,
getting cold feet?

00:34.991 --> 00:38.038
<i>I feel like Paris is
dragging her heels,</i>

00:38.081 --> 00:39.691
and I don't know why.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.042
- Carter's like, "Paris,
you don't plan anything,

00:42.085 --> 00:43.434
so I have to plan things."

00:43.478 --> 00:45.654
- Paris, this man's an octopus.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.656
Traditionally,
the mother of the bride

00:47.699 --> 00:49.484
<i>handles her daughter's wedding.</i>

00:49.527 --> 00:52.052
You need to work
on your guest list.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.270
<i>- It's hard for me to say no,</i>

00:53.314 --> 00:54.750
<i>especially when it involves
my mom.</i>

00:54.793 --> 00:57.187
It's causing a lot of stress
for Carter and I.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.188
- I don't know
what to tell you.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.364
- So beyond.

Okay, guys, come on in.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.157
So did you have any dream

01:54.201 --> 01:55.898
of your wedding invitation
at all?

01:55.941 --> 01:57.204
Have you ever seen anything,

01:57.247 --> 01:58.683
or have you been
thinking about anything?

01:58.727 --> 02:00.424
- Yeah, they say
that every little girl dreams

02:00.468 --> 02:01.730
about their wedding
their whole life...

02:01.773 --> 02:03.775
- Yeah.
- But I never really did.

02:03.819 --> 02:04.950
- You know what's funny?

02:04.994 --> 02:06.343
I'm in this business,
and I'm the same.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.997
- That's why we're here.
'Cause you're the best.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.216
- 100%.
Okay, good.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.261
That's the--
that is the right answer.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.655
- Lehr & Black, iconic.
- Thank you. I love that.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.396
- Iconic.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.049
- So many memories coming here
as a little girl.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.312
- Aww.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.443
- Carter's really
been pushing me

02:19.487 --> 02:20.792
to get the invites done,

02:20.836 --> 02:23.491
so today my mom and I are here
at Lehr & Black

02:23.534 --> 02:25.275
<i>to pick out our invitations.</i>

02:25.319 --> 02:26.407
- Where does the time go,
right?

02:26.450 --> 02:27.756
- Where does the time go?

02:27.799 --> 02:29.975
I swear, we talked about
this wedding for...

02:30.019 --> 02:31.194
- I know.
- Our whole lives.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.978
- "Just wait," I would say.
Oh, my goodness.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.197
- Right? Right?
You did.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
Every time I saw you,
"Just wait".

02:36.504 --> 02:38.245
Okay.
I'm gonna show you everything.

02:38.288 --> 02:41.117
We do everything
from simple, simple, simple,

02:41.161 --> 02:46.296
engraved formal, to huge boxes,
and everything in between.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.558
- I'm gonna take photos
because...

02:47.602 --> 02:48.646
- Yeah, take photos
of anything you want.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.561
- My broom--groomzilla
needs to see it.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.781
- Oh, my God, we're gonna
now call them brooms.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.609
- You should surprise him.
- He likes to see things.

02:54.652 --> 02:55.740
- Yeah.
- No, good.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.220
Take photos
of anything you want.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.004
- Okay.
- Oh, he'll want to see it.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.442
- This is called
foil and emboss.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.835
Foils are the metallics.
- Okay.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.490
- Then there's letterpress.
- What does that mean?

03:06.534 --> 03:09.580
- Okay, letterpress is
a little more organic.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.843
- Like, smushed inside?
- It's smushed in and it's ink.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.585
Then we get into
also watercoloring.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.545
Another one that's hand-done.
That's a hand-done calligraphy.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.895
Now, this is probably
your most formal,

03:19.938 --> 03:22.071
and it's engraving.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.855
It's old school engraving.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.248
- That's my favorite.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.207
- Yeah.
- This is too boring for me.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.514
- This is, like, a little--
- Oh, I love that.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.473
- Hand mirror.
- That is cute.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.605
I mean, it's not for you,
but it's really cute.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.303
- Yeah, this is a fun wedding.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.522
- Is there any cool,
like, acrylic ones?

03:38.566 --> 03:40.437
- It's funny.
Acrylic is coming back.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.830
- I know. I know.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.701
- No one has asked for it
except this year.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.137
- It's amazing.
- This year, all of a sudden.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.356
- Everybody wants--

03:46.400 --> 03:47.836
- It's so modern.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.707
- It is.
- So cool.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.883
- The acrylics in color.
Isn't that pretty?

03:51.927 --> 03:54.364
- Yeah, and this is
my favorite color.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.845
- Yeah, I thought of you
last night, actually.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.542
- Why?
- Paris.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.240
- What's up?
- This is so cool.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.721
It's so me.
- Right.

04:06.855 --> 04:10.075
- I'm obsessed with this one.
- I know.

04:10.119 --> 04:14.297
- I mean, this is a little bit
over the top for me.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.473
I can't see doing,

04:16.517 --> 04:19.084
like, a gorgeous tablecloth
like that

04:19.128 --> 04:22.087
and all these beautiful flowers
and then this.

04:22.131 --> 04:25.134
- Well, no one's bringing
their invite to dinner.

04:28.137 --> 04:31.662
- But everything should
kind of flow a little bit.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.796
Just something elegant.
We'll go through it.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.754
Something, like,
very White House.

04:36.798 --> 04:37.886
- 100%.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.235
- Very Buckingham Palace.
- I got you.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.323
- But understated.
- I got you.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.586
- White House? What?

04:42.630 --> 04:44.153
<i>My mom and I have
opposite taste</i>

04:44.196 --> 04:45.459
<i>when it comes to invites.</i>

04:45.502 --> 04:48.244
<i>I want something
that's fun and me.</i>

04:48.288 --> 04:49.767
<i>Of course, she never listens.</i>

04:49.811 --> 04:51.900
<i>My mom just acts like
I'm a little kid</i>

04:51.943 --> 04:54.163
<i>and just goes and does
whatever she wants.</i>

04:54.206 --> 04:55.599
It's my wedding.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.949
Shouldn't I be the one
who gets to pick the invites?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.516
- She doesn't even like
to be bothered

04:59.560 --> 05:01.953
with details, you know?

05:01.997 --> 05:05.392
- But I like to have
an opinion, dear.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.393
- Dear?

05:08.177 --> 05:12.355
I have planned some beautiful
weddings in my lifetime,

05:12.399 --> 05:15.097
so I know what I'm doing.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.839
- So what do we have?
We have a Friday night event?

05:17.882 --> 05:19.797
- Thursday.
- Thursday also?

05:19.841 --> 05:21.364
Thursday is the wedding.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.192
- Oh, Thursday's the wedding.
Okay.

05:23.235 --> 05:26.891
- And then Friday is
the carnival you're doing?

05:26.935 --> 05:28.632
- Yeah.
- A carnival, yeah.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
- Amusement park.
- After the wedding?

05:30.025 --> 05:30.982
Oh, that's fun.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.767
- So on Thursday,
November 11th,

05:32.810 --> 05:34.812
we're gonna be having
the wedding ceremony

05:34.856 --> 05:36.466
<i>at my grandfather's
old estate, Brooklawn.</i>

05:36.510 --> 05:37.989
- Wow.
Look at that.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.427
- That would be so amazing.
Like, can you imagine?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.167
And then the next night,
we've rented out

05:42.211 --> 05:43.821
<i>the Santa Monica Pier,</i>

05:43.865 --> 05:45.649
<i>and we're throwing
a neon carnival.</i>

05:45.693 --> 05:47.608
<i>So we're gonna
have performances.</i>

05:47.651 --> 05:50.524
<i>We're gonna play games
and go on the rides,</i>

05:50.567 --> 05:52.134
<i>and it's just gonna be
so much fun.</i>

05:52.177 --> 05:54.266
And then on Saturday,
we're having another

05:54.310 --> 05:56.225
celebration party
back at Brooklawn

05:56.268 --> 05:57.444
<i>because we want to celebrate</i>

05:57.487 --> 05:59.271
<i>with as many people
as possible.</i>

05:59.315 --> 06:02.013
- Do you need to, Paris,
come up with the guest list?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.580
- Yep.
Mm-hmm.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.496
We're inviting more people
to Friday instead of Thursday

06:06.540 --> 06:07.889
because it's, like, a wedding.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.325
Those are obviously the people
I care most about,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.545
so obviously they're gonna be
invited to the dinner

06:11.588 --> 06:14.504
on Friday as well--
I mean, Saturday as well.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.114
- They are?

06:16.158 --> 06:18.552
- Whoever's coming to Thursday
is coming to--

06:18.595 --> 06:20.815
- No, you don't do
the same thing on Friday.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.904
It's--
- Same people.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.125
<i>There's three
different guest lists</i>

06:27.169 --> 06:29.214
because there's one
for each night,

06:29.258 --> 06:31.521
so it's confusing for me.

06:31.565 --> 06:34.089
<i>This is gonna be
very stressful.</i>

06:34.132 --> 06:35.525
- Now what--guess what.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.135
You're gonna have
a little issue, though.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.485
- Okay, why?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.661
- Because you're gonna be
sending things.

06:40.704 --> 06:44.578
- Why is that an issue?
- You got to get a response.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.536
- Oh, you don't respond?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.756
- I do, but sometimes
I lose my phones.

06:48.799 --> 06:52.412
- But you know who responds
in about four seconds?

06:52.455 --> 06:53.413
- Yeah, who?
- Who?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.762
- Carter.
He's like---

06:54.805 --> 06:56.198
- Yeah, but Carter--
- Oh, well, there you go.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.678
- But you deal with me.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.115
- Oh, no, I'm gonna send--yeah.
I'm sending you.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.682
- He is not the mother
of the bride.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.857
- No, I was gonna send you.
- Right?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.336
- I got you.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.428
- You listen to the last person
that gets your ear.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.907
- Right.
That's right.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.823
- And I know who it is.
I always know who it is.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.438
Paris is my baby. I'm sorry.
- Of course.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.569
Of course.
- She's the baby.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
- The baby's always the baby.
I get it.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.139
- People put bees
in the baby's bonnet

07:24.182 --> 07:26.489
and get the baby worked up.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.797
Right?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.713

- We can do ground beef,
but we also have pulled.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.643
- Okay, I'd love ground beef
with lettuce and cheese.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.122
- Yeah, I can do that for you.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.733

Oh, that looks wonderful.
Thank you.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.176
- I hope I didn't
interrupt the cuddling.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.789
- Nope, it was perfect.
We got it in.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.705
And then I told Paris
we had to come.

08:08.749 --> 08:11.142

Sorry we're late.

- Can I borrow
some of your guac?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.145
- You sure can.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.279
- We--oh, actually,
this is funny.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.194
We're just asking everyone
who's gonna give a toast,

08:19.237 --> 08:20.935
"If you could just
submit yourself on tape,

08:20.978 --> 08:22.850
Paris would like
to put eyes on it."

08:22.893 --> 08:24.286
- I don't like
when people try to be cute

08:24.329 --> 08:25.461
and make weird jokes,

08:25.505 --> 08:26.941
and then you have
to pretend to laugh,

08:26.984 --> 08:28.464
and then you wanna rip
their hair out of their head.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.033
Tell us what you really think,
Ms. Hilton.

08:32.076 --> 08:35.253
- We're very sweet.
If you mess with us--

08:35.297 --> 08:38.474
- Then what do we do?
- Turn into little witches.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.129
- Wowsers.
Sounds serious.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.263
<i>It's hard to believe
we're honestly</i>

08:45.307 --> 08:47.831
<i>nine weeks away
from the wedding.</i>

08:47.875 --> 08:49.093
I would start with everything

08:49.137 --> 08:50.965
that hasn't been done
for the wedding,

08:51.008 --> 08:52.880
but that's way too long
of a list,

08:52.923 --> 08:55.012
so let me start
with what's been done.

08:55.056 --> 08:59.887
A date,
a wedding dress, a venue.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.758
<i>But I keep stressing
to Paris and Kathy,</i>

09:01.802 --> 09:03.194
there are
a lot of other details

09:03.238 --> 09:05.283
that have to come
between now and the wedding.

09:05.327 --> 09:08.243
- I sent Charlotte my list.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.853
- Well, the one thing
to think about,

09:09.897 --> 09:11.115
when you count up--I forget--

09:11.159 --> 09:15.380
between your family members,
which are a lot.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.991
My family is not quite as big.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.036
- I mean, I think
my list was 75 people.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.908
- You told me
your mom was doing ten.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.084
- Well, how many people
are you having?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.346
- I don't know.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.391
I haven't put together
the whole list yet.

09:26.435 --> 09:30.526
- Dad has seven siblings,
and everybody's married.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.049
- And they're all coming?

09:32.093 --> 09:35.618
- Well, I mean, let's just say.
So that's 16.

09:35.662 --> 09:39.709
I have--with my sisters
and their family,

09:39.753 --> 09:43.887
So that's, like, 25, 30 people.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.674
And then let's say
we have 20 couples.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.197
- What?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.242
But I want some people
that I like at the wedding too.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.504
- I don't blame you.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.202
- Sounds like
your mom's taking 75 people,

09:54.245 --> 09:55.812
and you're taking 10.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.598
<i>- I'm getting so frustrated.</i>

09:58.641 --> 10:01.731
<i>She's literally inviting
more people than Carter and I.</i>

10:01.775 --> 10:03.428
<i>Like, it's my wedding.</i>

10:03.472 --> 10:05.822
<i>How many times
do I have to tell this woman?</i>

10:05.866 --> 10:07.519
I have friends too.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.391
- You want to invite people
to your own wedding?

10:09.434 --> 10:10.958
- Yes.
- Are you crazy?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.568
<i>- So we have,
like, over 500 people</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:15.658
if we combine my list
with my mom's and Carter's.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.529
Brooklawn can only hold
a certain amount,

10:17.573 --> 10:19.444
<i>so we really need
to do a walkthrough</i>

10:19.488 --> 10:20.881
<i>so we can figure out</i>

10:20.924 --> 10:22.970
<i>the maximum number of people
we can invite.</i>

10:23.013 --> 10:24.754
- Do you know
how many people say to me,

10:24.798 --> 10:26.756
"Oh, when's the wedding?"

10:26.800 --> 10:28.540
I mean, we could easily
throw a wedding

10:28.584 --> 10:29.846
for about 2,000 people

10:29.890 --> 10:31.021
just based on people
who have asked me so far.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.284
- More.
- Well, that's nervy.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.460
- Well, I have
so many investors,

10:35.504 --> 10:37.245
like, people that work with me,

10:37.288 --> 10:38.768
and now
I have to figure that out.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.291
- Who don't you know?

10:40.335 --> 10:43.033
<i>♪</i>

10:43.077 --> 10:44.774
- I know one or two people.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.167
That's all.
That's all.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.431
- I made it very clear
from the beginning.

10:49.474 --> 10:53.304
<i>Paris and I will
plan the wedding.</i>

10:53.348 --> 10:56.960
The flowers,
the color of the tablecloths,

10:57.004 --> 10:59.876
<i>the overall vibe of the tent.</i>

10:59.920 --> 11:04.098
I will not put my nose
into the carnival

11:04.141 --> 11:06.666
or the Saturday night dinner.

11:08.189 --> 11:12.149
- When it comes to New York,
somehow, we got to...

11:12.193 --> 11:14.499
bring all the powers that be
on the wedding planning.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.111
- When do you fly in?

11:17.154 --> 11:20.157
- Fly in Wednesday red-eye.

11:20.201 --> 11:23.334
- I leave Friday

11:23.378 --> 11:26.555
for the engagement party.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.252
- That's so great.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.037
<i>- So I just got back
from Michigan.</i>

11:30.080 --> 11:32.561
Now I already have to fly
to New York for Fashion Week,

11:32.604 --> 11:33.997
which is fun.
I love it.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.347
But it's stressful
because I am also doing

11:36.391 --> 11:37.697
my engagement party.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.133
I have to go to fashion shows.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.482
<i>I have so many things
happening.</i>

11:40.525 --> 11:42.179
I have to plan the wedding.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.008
Everything is just
moving so fast.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.010
- One thing I need you both
to promise me is,

11:47.054 --> 11:49.099
by the time
you guys are in New York,

11:49.143 --> 11:51.711
you have to get together
and figure out the list

11:51.754 --> 11:53.625
because it's gonna be
tricky math.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.366
I'll warn you of that.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.804
Three-way pinky swear.
You guys have promised me.

11:57.847 --> 12:01.068
You've promised the groomzilla
you're gonna figure this out.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.026
All right, you guys are
in charge of the guest list.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.383
- How was Lily-Grace's
first day at school?

12:55.426 --> 12:57.820
- So sweet.
-

12:57.864 --> 12:59.387
- She ran,

12:59.430 --> 13:02.172
took the teacher's hand,
walked away.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
Didn't even look back,
and I just started crying.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.828
- It's like something
out of a movie.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.048
- It was.
She didn't even look back.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.659
I did not wear this
for drop-off, by the way.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.748
- A MILF.
-

13:12.792 --> 13:15.185
Can you imagine
wearing this to drop-off?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.363
Paris and I have been going
to New York Fashion Week

13:19.407 --> 13:21.539
<i>since we were teenagers.</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:24.499
<i>It's one of our favorite times
of the year.</i>

13:24.542 --> 13:28.895
<i>It's just a fun,
crazy, jam-packed week.</i>

13:28.938 --> 13:32.420
Like, what more
could one ask for?

13:32.463 --> 13:35.075
I brought some little snackies.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.293
See, I'm a true New Yorker.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.470
I brought you
donuts and coffee.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.605
- Yes, pink.
- Pink?

13:43.648 --> 13:45.302
- We're literally
probably the only girls

13:45.346 --> 13:46.826
at Fashion Week
eating donuts...

13:46.869 --> 13:48.610
- Eating.
- McDonald's, Taco Bell.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.265
- Eating, period.
- Yeah, that too.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.875
I love New York Fashion Week.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.921
When I was a teenager,
it was all about

13:54.964 --> 13:57.140
<i>just having fun
and going to the shows</i>

13:57.184 --> 13:59.447
<i>and going to the parties
and having a good time.</i>

13:59.490 --> 14:01.318
<i>But now, it's all about work.</i>

14:01.362 --> 14:03.407
This is so good.
- I know.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.844
<i>- I'm walking in the shows.</i>

14:04.887 --> 14:07.629
I'm having to do interviews.
I'm here for my brand.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.891
I have brands
that are paying me

14:08.935 --> 14:10.327
to attend their shows.

14:10.371 --> 14:14.244
<i>I have to do content
and being a designer also.</i>

14:14.288 --> 14:16.899
It's just all part
of this business.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.119
- Oh, my God.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.512
It's very stressful, a wedding.

14:21.556 --> 14:24.864
- I know.
- Do you have a caterer?

14:24.907 --> 14:27.562
- No.

14:27.605 --> 14:28.737
- Do you have a valet?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.478
- I didn't even think
about that part.

14:30.521 --> 14:31.871
I've been more stressed out

14:31.914 --> 14:34.438
just, like, putting together
just all the list.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.831
- Why?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.964
- Because I don't even have
anyone's address.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.531
Like, people don't,
like, do real mail anymore.

14:40.575 --> 14:43.143
It's like,
everyone just DMs each other.

14:43.186 --> 14:46.842
- You gonna DM the invite?
- I'm gonna DM the invite.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.107
- You are a rare bird.
- I know.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.589
I need to pick the song
I'm walking to down the aisle.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.591
And I'm thinking when I walk
down the aisle, like,

14:56.634 --> 14:59.072
about to come out,
release all these butterflies.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.422
- Great...

15:01.465 --> 15:03.337
but you need to invite people.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.166
- Yeah.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.952
- You guys need to, like,
sit down and iron all this out.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.867
It's getting very close.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.826
- I know.
- And there's no invitations--

15:14.870 --> 15:17.307
- It's, like,
less than eight weeks.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.005
- I am definitely

15:19.048 --> 15:21.790
the annoying little sister
at times.

15:21.833 --> 15:26.012
I'm not denying that at all,
but I tell her how it is.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.970
<i>I'm the only one
that will do it.</i>

15:28.014 --> 15:30.407
So what's the big deal?
Get the list.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.976
<i>She's always been
at the center of her universe</i>

15:34.020 --> 15:36.892
<i>and her work
and all about her,</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:41.157
and she will soon find out
that, in marriage,

15:41.201 --> 15:43.377
you don't put yourself first.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.987
What are you wearing to Saks?

15:45.031 --> 15:47.381
- No idea.
- Well, better figure it out.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.165
- Well, that's why I wanted you
to come over and help me,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.037
'cause literally--
since our first Fashion Week,

15:51.080 --> 15:53.909
you're the one who's always
picked out the looks for me.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.172
- You just don't like to deal.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.914
- Don't break the DJ computer.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.872
- Oh, this is the DJ computer?
- Mm-hmm.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.439
- Your set ready for Saks?

16:02.483 --> 16:04.964
- No.
- No?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.053
- I'm the worst.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.316
I'm gonna grab some outfits
and see what you think.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.621
- Okay.

16:13.363 --> 16:17.541
There's never a shortage
of sandwiches lying around.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.853
- Over here.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.033
<i>♪</i>

16:31.077 --> 16:34.994
- This self-portrait.
Maybe for engagement.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.169
- No.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.561
- It's like a hot nun.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.041
- You don't want to look
like a hot nun

16:39.085 --> 16:40.260
at your engagement party.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.435
- Good point.

16:41.478 --> 16:42.610
We're having
our engagement party

16:42.653 --> 16:44.264
so many months
after we got engaged

16:44.307 --> 16:46.614
because our schedules
have just been so insane.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.268
<i>We've had no time.</i>

16:48.311 --> 16:50.748
<i>Plus we wanna celebrate with
all our friends in New York.</i>

16:50.792 --> 16:52.663
I thought
it wouldn't be stressful,

16:52.707 --> 16:54.448
<i>but it is
completely stressful.</i>

16:54.491 --> 16:56.493

16:57.973 --> 16:59.627

- Fun.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.063

17:01.107 --> 17:03.457
- This Moschino.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.590
My schedule is out of control.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.115
- What are you doing here?
- The fitting.

17:09.158 --> 17:12.074
And then the engagement party,
obviously.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.206
I'm going to Monse,

17:13.249 --> 17:15.121
then a fitting
for the Blonds tomorrow.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.992
- You're walking the Blonds
or just attending?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.126

are off to New York,

<i>to grab my sister and Mindy.</i>

21:17.493 --> 21:18.538

a few details

<i>I really hope Kathy's

21:22.150 --> 21:25.109
Just felt like I have to take
the bull by the horns.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.329
We have to think
about the guests.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.680
Ooh, it's a little smaller
than I had built up in my head.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.203
That's probably--
what do you think?

21:32.247 --> 21:33.944
Two tennis courts?

21:33.988 --> 21:36.077
- She gonna--she's gonna
walk down aisle here.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.687
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:37.731 --> 21:41.038
And then when guests arrive,
they'll kind of all meet here.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.518
- Mm-hmm.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.825
- Wedding, 250-ish?

21:44.868 --> 21:47.784
- Okay, it is a little smaller
than I had in my head,

21:47.828 --> 21:50.526
so I'm recalibrating
everything.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.311
<i>Hearing about
the venue's capacity,</i>

21:52.354 --> 21:54.530
<i>I was like, "How the heck</i>

21:54.574 --> 21:57.664
"are we gonna have
Kathy's pretty big list,

21:57.707 --> 22:01.972
Paris' very big list,
and my at least family?"

22:02.016 --> 22:04.888
And so basically,
we would build a rotunda

22:04.932 --> 22:08.588
or some type of flower thing
like you had right there.

22:08.631 --> 22:12.026
On Thursday, I looked
at the sunset that day.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.375
It's, like, 4:48.
- Right.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.726
- You gotta be
walking down the aisle 3:30.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.075
- That's tough.
- Yeah.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.903
Well, if they got invited
to the royal wedding,

22:19.947 --> 22:21.862
Mindy, they're either coming,
or they're not.

22:21.905 --> 22:25.561
Wednesday, we do photos.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.694
Like, anyone
who we want a photo of,

22:27.737 --> 22:29.522
so that we don't
have to do it on Thursday.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.827
And we also--
- But how's that gonna work?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.438
Were people gonna--
they won't be dressed.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.178
- Yeah, they're gonna
come dressed.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.180
They want to be in the wedding,
they're coming dressed.

22:36.224 --> 22:37.399
- Wait, you can't do that.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.705
That's so weird.
- We'll talk about it.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
- I didn't do that, though.

22:42.796 --> 22:46.669
- But either way, the plan
would be wood floor trellises.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.192
- Yes.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.630
- So you would build--
you would have all that built--

22:50.673 --> 22:52.588
I'll have that built,
and then you would just create

22:52.632 --> 22:54.111
a straight line
down the middle.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.374
- Yeah.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.897
- We have to think about,
for the guests,

22:56.940 --> 23:00.161
a way to articulate
what to wear,

23:00.204 --> 23:01.771
and then Paris made a list

23:01.815 --> 23:04.295
of a lot of entertainers
that, obviously, she knows.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.863
I think the thought is not only
big DJs, but try to figure out

23:06.907 --> 23:08.952
how to roll out,
like, boom, boom, boom.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.389
- Yep.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.739
- Just kind of, like,
run a small music festival.

23:12.782 --> 23:13.827
- Right.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.132
- Not all my ideas
are good ideas,

23:15.176 --> 23:17.787
but full of ideas
just 'cause I've been thrust

23:17.831 --> 23:20.964
into this groomzilla role,
whether I like it or not.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.183
- Yes.
-

23:22.226 --> 23:24.968
- My confidence level
is relatively high

23:25.012 --> 23:27.449
<i>that everything will
get done in time,</i>

23:27.493 --> 23:29.320
but it's also relatively high

23:29.364 --> 23:30.800
that they're gonna
literally plan

23:30.844 --> 23:33.324
the entire wedding
in two weeks.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.761
I know my lane,

23:34.804 --> 23:37.328
but I also know that weddings
don't plan themselves.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.330
I have a list
of about 1,000 things,

23:39.374 --> 23:41.071
so I just want
to get ahead of 'em,

23:41.115 --> 23:43.378
but defer to the experts.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.075
- No, you don't.
- I do.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.686
I really--

23:46.729 --> 23:49.079
By the way, Mindy, once I know
we have the infrastructure,

23:49.123 --> 23:51.865

all to you guys for sure.

I just wasn't planning

like, at all yet.
- Sorry.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.054
I was at a fashion show
last night, and they're like,

24:51.098 --> 24:54.014
"What are you most excited
about New York Fashion Week?"

24:54.057 --> 24:56.407

25:00.281 --> 25:04.459

I was like, "Ooh."

25:04.503 --> 25:06.461

25:06.505 --> 25:07.941

to be nice and invite

25:07.984 --> 25:10.378
all of our New York friends

25:10.421 --> 25:13.555
It's kind of, like,
a replacement for the wedding.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.252
And now people who are invited
to the engagement

25:15.296 --> 25:16.950

25:16.993 --> 25:18.734

25:18.778 --> 25:20.257

25:22.782 --> 25:25.480

25:25.524 --> 25:27.177

27:07.974 --> 27:10.063
- Well, you have to focus.

27:10.106 --> 27:13.109
Paris and my mom
have a big habit

27:13.153 --> 27:15.590

a heart attack.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.042
- Don't.
You're gonna be great.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.523
- Do I look beyond?
I'm so tired.

Big smile, girl.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.062
God, it's been
a year and a half.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.673
- I feel like

We would just, like--Tina,

29:29.898 --> 29:31.639
we would literally call
the male modeling agencies.

29:31.682 --> 29:34.468
They would send us
all of their booklets of guys.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.252
And we'd be like,
"Him, him, him, him, him."

29:36.296 --> 29:38.124
And then we, like,
send cars to go get them.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.429
And it would be,
like, me and Paris

29:39.473 --> 29:40.996
with, like, 30 dudes.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.824
My God.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.173
Speaking of exes,

29:44.217 --> 29:46.045
have you heard from any
when you got engaged?

29:46.088 --> 29:47.046
- No.
- No?

29:47.089 --> 29:48.221
- No.
- None?

29:48.264 --> 29:49.309
- Not even,
like, congratulatory?

29:49.352 --> 29:50.571
- No, like,
"Don't do this to me"?

29:50.614 --> 29:51.659
- I've changed
my number so many times,

29:51.702 --> 29:52.965
I think they don't have
my number.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.401
- They can't find you.
- Or I've blocked them.

29:54.444 --> 29:55.968
So they really
can't get a hold of me.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.056
- So no.
- So no.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.448
- No.

29:58.492 --> 29:59.928
- All the old boyfriends
used to hate it so much

29:59.972 --> 30:01.843
when you and I would
go out unsupervised.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.845
They just knew,
like, it was not gonna be--

30:03.889 --> 30:05.064
they hated it.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.413
- And they all
hate you so much.

30:06.456 --> 30:07.675
- They hate me so much.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.503
Because Paris and I
would go to dinner,

30:09.546 --> 30:10.809
then show back up, like,

30:10.852 --> 30:12.636
around, like, dinnertime
the next day.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.247
- Anything
to get away from them.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.336
Just go out
by ourselves before.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.641
But I haven't done--
how good have I been?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.121
- You've been insanely good.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.384
- I was telling everyone
that you guys used to call me,

30:21.428 --> 30:22.690
"The Runaway Bride."

30:22.733 --> 30:24.257
- Yes. We did.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.649
- Used to.

30:25.693 --> 30:26.999
- This time,
I'm not gonna run away.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.087
- No, you won't.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.349
- We're gonna put
a chip on you.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.698
- I won't run away.
I promise.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.874
I'm not gonna this up.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.616
- We were having drinks
in Italy, in Rome

30:35.659 --> 30:37.357
with, like, a fan of yours.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.838
And IG, the GOAT, was like,

30:39.881 --> 30:41.491
"We should invite him
to the wedding.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.189
He should come to the wedding.
Paris' wedding."

30:43.232 --> 30:46.279
And we were like, "Yeah, no."
- Right.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.411
- For the wedding,
she has, like, over 60.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.370
- Yes.
- That's not that bad.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.111
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

30:52.154 --> 30:54.678
- She's the mother
of the bride.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.202
She carried you
for nine months.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.334
- Yes.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.423
- So Carter told me
the wedding planner says

31:00.467 --> 31:02.295
that there's a capacity
of 250 people

31:02.338 --> 31:04.427
the night of the wedding
over at Brooklawn.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.342
<i>I don't even know
what we're gonna do.</i>

31:06.386 --> 31:08.170
I have a huge family,

31:08.214 --> 31:10.564
so there's, like, 100 of that.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.783
Carter's family is huge,

31:12.827 --> 31:15.395
and then on top of it,
my mom wants to invite everyone

31:15.438 --> 31:17.397
that she's ever met
in her life.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.921
For me to even think
about adding more names,

31:19.965 --> 31:23.446
I have to start crossing out
names in order to make room.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.796
- Where are you getting dressed
for the wedding?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.363
- At the house.
- Where's she getting married.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.756
Brooklawn.
- Mm-hmm.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.150
Carter went with Halle
and did a walkthrough.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.152
- Halle did a--

31:33.195 --> 31:34.501
- You realize you're the bride,

31:34.544 --> 31:36.068
and you're supposed
to be doing this stuff.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.766
- Carter is called groomzilla
because he's, like,

31:38.809 --> 31:42.335
on top of everything
because I'm so disorganized.

31:42.378 --> 31:45.468
Oh, and he just sent me
the--my invite.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.688
- You're gonna have, like,
your pink fairy dots?

31:47.731 --> 31:48.863
- It's sick.
I'll show you.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.951
- Yes.
- Oh, it's gonna be purple.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.518
- It was gonna be pink,

31:51.561 --> 31:53.781
but I changed it to turquoise
because I love Tiffany's--

31:53.824 --> 31:55.609
- I knew it was gonna
have some turquoise.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.959
- Turquoise with sequins
falling out when you open 'em.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.439
- My mom and I have
different taste

31:59.482 --> 32:00.788
when it comes to invites.

32:00.831 --> 32:03.443
She wanted something
that was more white

32:03.486 --> 32:05.662
and elegant and plain,

32:05.706 --> 32:08.970
and I wanted something that was
more like a Disney princess,

32:09.014 --> 32:11.233
<i>but I knew that she
wouldn't like that one,</i>

32:11.277 --> 32:13.801
<i>so I just did it with Carter.</i>

32:13.844 --> 32:16.064
It's, like, a beautiful box
that lights up.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.241
- Wait, this is your invite?
- Yeah.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.634
-
- What, you're laughing?

32:20.677 --> 32:22.201
You're mean.
- No, I love it.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.593
- It's beautiful.
- I love it.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.030
- It's gorgeous.
- This is so you.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.640
There's nothing
more Paris than this.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.250
'Cause everyone does white.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.252
- Yeah, it's boring.
- Obviously.

32:30.296 --> 32:31.688
<i>- My mom's not gonna be happy</i>

32:31.732 --> 32:33.690
<i>when she finds out
about these invites.</i>

32:35.518 --> 32:37.259
- I cannot believe
you're getting married.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.695
- I know.
I'm so excited.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.654
- It's so exciting.
So much has changed.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.047
Nicky has two kids.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.658
You're getting married.
You're getting unmarried.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.095
I'm still chasing guys
who hate me.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.401
So it's like--

32:48.444 --> 32:50.533
It's, like, you know--
I met my new neighbor

32:50.577 --> 32:51.882
the other night
in the rainstorm,

32:51.926 --> 32:53.362
and he was so hot.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.408
I'm sure
he'll make me cry in a week.

32:55.451 --> 32:56.931
There he is.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.455
- What's happening?
- Hi.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.674
- What's going on, dude?
Good to see you.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.023
- I'm sorry I'm ruining--

33:02.067 --> 33:03.938
- Your ears must be burning,
by the way.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.157
We were just talking
about you...

33:05.200 --> 33:06.506
- Really?
- This whole time.

33:06.549 --> 33:07.594
- The prince.
- All right.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.030
Well, we gotta go.
Love you guys.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.205
- Love you guys.

33:10.249 --> 33:11.467
- We'll see you
at the engagement party.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.687
- Love you.
- Love you guys.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.863
- See you guys.
- Love you.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.691
- Oh, my God, baby.
Did you bring my outfits?

33:17.734 --> 33:19.519
- I did bring your outfits.
They're all in the car.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.042

33:37.145 --> 33:41.367

at the invitations together,

"Carter has the list."

45:40.912 --> 45:44.959
And then apparently
Carter's told your assistant

45:45.003 --> 45:46.831
that Charlotte has the list.

45:46.874 --> 45:48.746
It's a standoff.

45:50.660 --> 45:53.663
- What are you dangling?
- She won't give the list.

45:53.707 --> 45:55.491
She won't send out
the save-the-dates.

45:57.189 --> 45:58.973
She won't commit to anything.

46:02.803 --> 46:04.762
It's, like, crazy town.

46:07.199 --> 46:09.244
Can't wait to hear her excuse.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.378
- Very curious.
