WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.295
(June) I'M LEARNING

00:01.752 --> 00:03.295
THAT AS RELATIONSHIPS EVOLVE

00:03.337 --> 00:06.089
AND THE LAYERS ARE PEELED BACK,

00:06.131 --> 00:08.091
YOU CAN START TO SEE YOUR

00:06.131 --> 00:08.091
FRIENDS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.427
SOMETIMES THEY SURPRISE YOU,

00:10.469 --> 00:12.095
AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

00:14.598 --> 00:15.474
HEY, JUNE.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.685
ALLEN.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.685
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME

00:17.726 --> 00:19.770
INSTEAD OF SPREADING RUMORS

00:17.726 --> 00:19.770
THAT I'M BI.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.480
WELL, LOOK, IN MY DEFENSE,

00:19.812 --> 00:21.480
I ONLY DID THAT

00:21.522 --> 00:24.483
BECAUSE YOU CALLED ME

00:21.522 --> 00:24.483
A FAT BEAST BEHIND MY BACK.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.067
I NEVER CALLED YOU A FAT BEAST.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.067
I WAS SAY--

00:26.109 --> 00:28.278
IT'S OKAY, JUNE.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.278
I'M OVER IT. SERIOUSLY.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.071
AND IN THE SPIRIT

00:28.320 --> 00:30.071
OF FORGIVENESS,

00:30.113 --> 00:32.073
I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU SOMEPLACE

00:30.113 --> 00:32.073
THAT'S VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.868
I WOULD LOVE TO.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.704
I MEAN, THAT IS SO GREAT OF YOU

00:33.909 --> 00:36.704
TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.039
I'D LOVE TO.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.585
I WANTED TO BRING SOMEONE

00:41.124 --> 00:43.585
I'VE MENDED A RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:43.627 --> 00:46.171
TO SEE ME TAKE A CHIP

00:43.627 --> 00:46.171
FOR 60 DAYS OF ABSTINENCE.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.089
OH, ALLEN. THAT IS GREAT.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.550
I'M SO GLAD YOU INVITED ME

00:49.591 --> 00:52.093
TO YOUR OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS

00:49.591 --> 00:52.093
MEETING.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.096
THIS IS

00:52.135 --> 00:55.096
AN ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.558
IF YOU MUST KNOW, I HAVE

00:55.138 --> 00:57.558
ONE DAY OF ABSTINENCE IN O.A.,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.935
AS I DESTROYED SOME

00:57.599 --> 00:59.935
MONGOLIAN BARBECUE LAST NIGHT

00:59.977 --> 01:03.397
AFTER A... DIFFICULT

00:59.977 --> 01:03.397
CONVERSATION WITH MY ROOMMATE.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.773
WELCOME.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.107
WE'LL BE STARTING

01:04.815 --> 01:06.107
TODAY'S MEETING

01:06.149 --> 01:08.777
WITH ONE OF

01:06.149 --> 01:08.777
OUR FAVORITE SPEAKERS.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.159
HI.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.286
I'M CHLOE,

01:16.201 --> 01:18.286
AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.748
(all) HI, CHLOE.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
(Katie Hampton) ♪ I'M NOT

AND I WIPED THE GUACAMOLE

01:32.175 --> 01:34.803
AND BLOOD OFF MY SHORTS,

01:34.845 --> 01:36.137
AND I TOLD JULIANNA MARGULIES

01:36.179 --> 01:38.807
THAT I WOULD PAY

01:36.179 --> 01:38.807
TO FIX HER NEPHEW'S TEETH.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.099
(all laugh)

01:43.186 --> 01:45.981
(all) KEEP COMING BACK.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.191

01:57.284 --> 02:00.161
JUNE! OF COURSE YOU'RE HERE.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.580
GOOD FOR YOU.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.664
I GUESS I ALWAYS KNEW

02:01.622 --> 02:02.664
YOU HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM

02:02.706 --> 02:04.165
AND I JUST DIDN'T WANNA

02:02.706 --> 02:04.165
SEE IT.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:05.709 --> 02:06.961
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:07.002 --> 02:08.169
THIS IS AN A.A. MEETING.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.169
I'M IN A.A.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.047
IT'LL BE THREE YEARS

02:08.211 --> 02:10.047
AND EIGHT MONTHS IN APRIL,

02:10.089 --> 02:11.214
GOD WILLING.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.051
HOW ARE YOU IN A.A.?

02:11.256 --> 02:14.051
YOU ARE ALWAYS DRINKING.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.343
OH, I'M NOT IN A.A.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.343
BECAUSE I'M SOBER.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.637
I'M IN IT BECAUSE

02:15.385 --> 02:16.637
IT'S THE BEST PLACE

02:16.678 --> 02:18.221
TO TELL MY CRAZY,

02:16.678 --> 02:18.221
WILD DRINKING STORIES

02:18.263 --> 02:20.682
TO AN AUDIENCE

02:18.263 --> 02:20.682
WHO ACTUALLY APPRECIATES THEM.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.268
IT'S LIKE HOW BLACK COMEDIANS

02:20.724 --> 02:23.268
GET THE BIGGEST LAUGHS

02:23.310 --> 02:24.561
FROM BLACK PEOPLE,

02:24.603 --> 02:26.480
WHEREAS WHITE PEOPLE

02:24.603 --> 02:26.480
BE ALL LIKE...

02:26.521 --> 02:28.398
(nasal voice)

02:26.521 --> 02:28.398
"WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

02:28.440 --> 02:31.192
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER

02:28.440 --> 02:31.192
SHIRLEY TEMPLE?"

02:31.234 --> 02:33.361
(laughing) RIGHT, GERALD?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.196
YOU GET IT.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.866
OH, I ALSO TAKE THE BOOZE

02:35.238 --> 02:37.866
FROM ALCOHOLICS

02:37.908 --> 02:39.576
WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:37.908 --> 02:39.576
STILL STRUGGLING.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.702
FREE BOOZE!

02:40.744 --> 02:42.621
COME ON, JUNE.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.621
I'M ALWAYS DRINKING.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.872
THAT ISN'T CHEAP.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.707
CHLOE, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.292
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED

02:45.749 --> 02:47.292
OF YOURSELF,

02:47.334 --> 02:49.503
USING THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.212
THEY'RE NOT THAT INNOCENT.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.714
RANDALL OVER THERE,

02:52.756 --> 02:55.509
HE DID 14 JAGER BOMBS

02:52.756 --> 02:55.509
AND TOOK HIS KID ON A BOAT.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.219
BAD NEWS--HE LOST CUSTODY

02:55.550 --> 02:58.219
OF HIS KID.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.681
GOOD NEWS--KEPT CUSTODY

02:58.261 --> 03:00.681
OF HIS BOAT.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.224
WHAT'S UP, SAINT LUCIA?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.224
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.271
(cell phone rings)

03:08.313 --> 03:09.397
(beep)

03:09.439 --> 03:12.233
DONNIE, HEY.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.233
SUPERSTAR! HOW'S IT HANGIN'?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.235
HOW'S YOUR DONG HANGIN'?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.235
(laughs)

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
ANY NEWS? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
THE SCORSESE MOVIE I'M UP FOR?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.239
NO DECISION YET,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
BUT I HEARD YOU'RE

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
ON THE SHORT LIST.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.743
THAT'S AMAZING.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.245
WELL, DON'T GET EXCITED

03:21.785 --> 03:24.245
JUST YET.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.331
MARTY'S CONCERNED

03:24.287 --> 03:26.331
YOU'RE A LITTLE...

03:26.373 --> 03:28.167
LIGHTWEIGHT.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.251
LIGHTWEIGHT?

03:28.207 --> 03:30.251
That you're not deep enough

03:28.207 --> 03:30.251
for the role.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.546
HE LIKES TO CAST ACTORS

03:30.293 --> 03:32.546
WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH TRAUMA--

03:32.587 --> 03:34.756
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, JAIL TIME.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.257
MARK WAHLBERG WAS IN

03:34.798 --> 03:36.257
"THE DEPARTED,"

03:36.299 --> 03:38.886
AND HE BEAT A VIETNAMESE MAN

03:36.299 --> 03:38.886
HALF-BLIND.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.261
WELL, I-I'VE HAD TRAUMA. I--

03:40.303 --> 03:42.848
ONE TIME, MY BANK SENT ME CHECKS

03:40.303 --> 03:42.848
WITHOUT SPACES BETWEEN

03:42.890 --> 03:44.432
THE "VAN," THE "DER,"

03:42.890 --> 03:44.432
AND THE "BEEK."

03:44.474 --> 03:47.061
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.061
MARTY'S A FAN.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.269
YOU'RE STILL IN THE MIX.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
(sighs) OKAY. I GUESS.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
Also, unrelated,

03:52.315 --> 03:53.942
I'M LETTING ALL MY CLIENTS IN

03:52.315 --> 03:53.942
ON SOMETHING.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.486
WE GOT SOME NEWS ABOUT

03:53.984 --> 03:56.486
MY WIFE'S HEALTH, AND--

03:56.528 --> 03:57.988
(beep)

03:56.528 --> 03:57.988
(clatter)

03:58.030 --> 03:59.280
(sighs)

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
LIGHTWEIGHT?

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
SO THEN CHLOE WALKS OUT

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
OF THE A.A. MEETING

04:04.369 --> 04:06.287
LIKE SHE JUST DID

04:04.369 --> 04:06.287
A GOOD DEED.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.082
SHE IS A PIECE OF WORK.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.290
SEE ANYONE FAMOUS THERE?

04:09.332 --> 04:10.500
OBVIOUSLY,

04:09.332 --> 04:10.500
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT,

04:10.542 --> 04:11.710
BUT I WILL TELL YOU

04:11.752 --> 04:12.711
THAT I'LL NEVER BE ABLE

04:11.752 --> 04:12.711
TO WATCH "NIGHT COURT"

04:12.753 --> 04:14.213
THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.297
I KNOW WHO IT IS. I KNOW

04:14.254 --> 04:16.297
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.092
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.300
YOUR NEW PHONE

04:18.133 --> 04:19.300
IS ALL SET UP.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.677
THANK YOU, MARK.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.303
I HATE TECHNOLOGICAL STUFF.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.303
I'M SO BAD AT IT.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.722
NO PROBLEM.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.391
I NOTICED MOST OF YOUR PHOTOS

04:23.764 --> 04:26.391
ARE 2-SECOND LONG VIDEOS.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.560
MY MOM DOES THE SAME THING.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.560
IT'S CUTE.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.187
(chuckles)

04:30.229 --> 04:33.314
HEY, MARK, I'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT

04:30.229 --> 04:33.314
MY FRIEND MARISA, RIGHT?

04:33.356 --> 04:34.399
THE ONE I HAD

04:33.356 --> 04:34.399
THE SECRET LANGUAGE WITH

04:34.441 --> 04:37.945
WHEN WE WERE BRIEFLY LESBIANS

04:34.441 --> 04:37.945
TOGETHER AT CHICO STATE?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.196
D-THE G-OO YUH-THE G-OO

04:39.238 --> 04:40.697
R-THE-GUH M-THE G-EM

04:39.238 --> 04:40.697
B-THE G-ER?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.323
DO YOU REMEMBER?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.324
I'VE TRIED TO ERASE IT

04:42.365 --> 04:43.324
FROM MY HEAD,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.410
BUT YEP,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.410
IT'S STILL IN THERE.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.328
OKAY, WELL, I WANNA

04:45.452 --> 04:47.328
SET YOU UP WITH HER.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.790
SHE IS SMART. SHE IS CUTE.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.542
SHE HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.335
PEPPER, MARK DOESN'T WANNA

04:52.584 --> 04:54.335
BE SET UP WITH SOME--

04:54.377 --> 04:55.921
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY NOT?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.423
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE

04:55.963 --> 04:58.423
JENNIFER AND I BROKE UP.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.341
I'LL DO IT.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.341
YAY!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.551
(laughs)

05:01.593 --> 05:02.970
I'M GONNA CALL THAT HOOKER.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.387
OKAY.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.557
DO YOU REALLY WANNA GO ON A DATE

05:04.429 --> 05:07.557
WITH A FRIEND OF PEPPER'S?

05:07.599 --> 05:08.934
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.769
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT

05:08.976 --> 05:10.769
ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON, RIGHT?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.395
YEAH. AH.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.275
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE

05:12.437 --> 05:16.275
ANYTHING ELSE. HO-HO!

05:16.316 --> 05:18.526
I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU LAUGH

05:16.316 --> 05:18.526
LIKE THAT.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.653
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.076
SO THEN I WAS LIKE,

05:22.322 --> 05:26.076
"TACOS? WHAT FISH TACOS?"

05:26.118 --> 05:27.995
(all laugh)

05:29.412 --> 05:32.291
UH, I'M MICHAEL,

05:29.412 --> 05:32.291
AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.374
(all) HI, MICHAEL.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.252
I DID SOMETHING HORRIBLE

05:33.416 --> 05:35.252
FOUR YEARS AGO,

05:35.294 --> 05:38.088
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE

05:35.294 --> 05:38.088
I'M ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.257
(door closes)

05:38.130 --> 05:40.257
I WENT OUT TO BUY

05:38.130 --> 05:40.257
A PACK OF CIGARETTES...

05:40.299 --> 05:41.758
(Michael speaks indistinctly)

05:40.299 --> 05:41.758
I GOT NEWS.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.262
I'M ON THE SHORT LIST

05:41.800 --> 05:45.262
FOR A MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIE.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.471
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S AMAZING.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.015
BUT APPARENTLY,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.015
I GUESS HE'S CONCERNED

05:48.056 --> 05:50.058
THAT I'M NOT DEEP ENOUGH

05:48.056 --> 05:50.058
FOR THE ROLE.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.226
(Michael, voice breaking)

05:50.100 --> 05:51.226
AND I THOUGHT

05:51.268 --> 05:52.393
I COULD SEE OUT

05:51.268 --> 05:52.393
THE REARVIEW MIRROR,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.395
BUT MY DOG, HE COULDN'T SEE ME.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.648
(Michael speaking indistinctly)

05:54.437 --> 05:56.648
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING,

05:54.437 --> 05:56.648
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE

05:56.690 --> 05:58.441
LIFE EXPERIENCE

05:56.690 --> 05:58.441
THAT'S DEEP ENOUGH,

05:58.483 --> 06:00.319
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING

05:58.483 --> 06:00.319
EVEN BETTER--

06:00.359 --> 06:01.820
INCREDIBLE ACTING TALENT.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.404
I'LL JUST PRETEND

06:01.862 --> 06:03.404
TO BE DEEP.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.406
YOU ARE SO GOOD

06:03.446 --> 06:05.406
AT PRETENDING.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.574
RIGHT?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
SO I'M THINKING WHAT I SHOULD DO

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
IS PROBABLY TALK TO PEOPLE

06:08.118 --> 06:10.411
WHO HAVE HAD

06:08.118 --> 06:10.411
TRAUMATIC LIFE EXPERIENCES.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.206
SO WHERE DO I FIND

06:10.453 --> 06:12.206
PEOPLE LIKE THAT?

06:12.247 --> 06:15.625
"ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN,

06:12.247 --> 06:15.625
MEEMO!"

06:15.667 --> 06:18.295
(whispers) "ALL DOGS."

06:18.337 --> 06:19.420
OH! (chuckles)

06:19.462 --> 06:21.006
DUH.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.006
(slaps thigh)

06:21.048 --> 06:22.132
I'LL GO GET ONE OF

06:21.048 --> 06:22.132
THOSE GLAZED DOUGHNUTS.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.343
I ALWAYS BRAINSTORM BEST

06:22.174 --> 06:24.343
ON A FULL TUMMY.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.261
ALL RIGHT,

06:24.383 --> 06:26.261
LET'S HEAR IT FOR MICHAEL.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.305
DOUG, YOU'RE UP. BUM US OUT.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.681
I WAS LIVING IN ORLANDO..

06:29.723 --> 06:31.432
(horns honk)

06:31.474 --> 06:34.311
THANKS SO MUCH FOR HELPING ME

06:31.474 --> 06:34.311
SET UP MY NEW DESK, MARK.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.437
I BOUGHT IT ONLINE

06:34.353 --> 06:36.437
FROM THIS HUNGARIAN COMPANY.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
AND THE WORDS

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
IN THE INSTRUCTIONS

06:37.522 --> 06:39.440
ARE ALMOST ALL CONSONANTS.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.734
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

06:39.482 --> 06:40.734
I KNOW HUNGARIAN.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.444
YOU DO?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.444
NOPE.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.444
JUST FEEL PRESSURED TO HELP.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.655
SAVED ANOTHER LIFE!

06:45.697 --> 06:47.741
OH, JUNE, YOU KNOW HIM.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.741
IT'S YOUR COWORKER ALLEN.

06:47.782 --> 06:51.161
CHLOE, YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT.

06:47.782 --> 06:51.161
IT'S AN ANONYMOUS PROGRAM.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.872
OH! I SEE WHY

06:51.203 --> 06:53.872
I'VE BEEN CONFUSED.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.500
YEAH, APPARENTLY INSTRUCTION  ZOR

06:53.914 --> 06:57.500
COMES BEFORE INSTRUCTION  OCTH.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.459
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.837
YOU CAN'T KEEP USING

06:58.501 --> 07:00.837
THESE PEOPLE.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.464
I'M NOT USING THEM. THEY HAVE TO

07:00.879 --> 07:03.464
GET RID OF THEIR BOOZE ANYWAY,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.466
SO IN A WAY, I'M HELPING.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.468
I'M SAVING LIVES.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.468
I'M LIKE A DOCTOR.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.264
THEY NEED THIS PROGRAM.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.264
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.974
YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT

07:10.305 --> 07:12.974
FOR YOUR OWN SELFISH GAIN.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.311
LISTEN, I FULLY SUPPORT

07:13.016 --> 07:16.311
WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.520
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.398
I LOVE PEOPLE

07:17.562 --> 07:19.398
THAT DON'T DRINK.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.732
SHORTER LINE AT THE BAR.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.483
BUT WHILE WE ARE

07:20.774 --> 07:22.483
POINTING FINGERS,

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
YOU  ARE THE ONE

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
THAT'S USING SOMEONE--

07:24.527 --> 07:26.571
DRAMATIC PAUSE--

07:26.613 --> 07:28.573
THAT GUY IN THE OTHER ROOM.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.573
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.491
YOU KNOW

07:28.615 --> 07:30.491
THAT MARK LIKES YOU,

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
BUT YOU'RE STILL HAVING HIM

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
DO FAVORS--

07:32.535 --> 07:33.870
SETTING UP YOUR iPhone,

07:33.912 --> 07:35.496
PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR DESK,

07:35.538 --> 07:37.916
POINTING OUT WHEN YOUR MASCARA

07:35.538 --> 07:37.916
COLLECTS IN YOUR EYE CORNERS,

07:37.958 --> 07:39.667
WHICH I CAN TELL

07:37.958 --> 07:39.667
HE HASN'T DONE YET TODAY.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.503
COME ON.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.503
I AM NOT USING MARK.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.922
I'M NOT EVEN SURE

07:42.545 --> 07:43.922
IF HE LIKES ME.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.299
HE'S NEVER TOLD ME THAT

07:43.964 --> 07:45.299
HIMSELF.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.217
I ONLY HEARD IT SECONDHAND

07:45.340 --> 07:47.217
FROM JAMES.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.760
OH, NO, IT'S TRUE.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.430
I DO LIKE YOU, JUNE.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.473
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.184
HO-HO!

07:56.226 --> 07:57.477
TOLD YA.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.521
(door slams)

08:07.570 --> 08:08.529
SO...

08:08.571 --> 08:09.906
YOU LIKE ME.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.783
YEAH, I DO.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.535
I-I'VE BEEN WANTING TO BRING IT

08:11.825 --> 08:14.535
UP WITH YOU FOR A WHILE,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.371
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.623
AND WELL,

08:16.413 --> 08:18.623
I GUESS IT'S OUT NOW.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.541
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.752
(thud)

08:20.583 --> 08:22.752
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.545
WHO'S THROWING CONDOMS?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.423
SO, UM, MARK,

08:26.465 --> 08:28.549
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I CARE

08:26.465 --> 08:28.549
ABOUT YOU...

08:28.591 --> 08:31.428
A-AS A FRIEND.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.554
I KNOW.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.764
I KINDA THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT

08:33.596 --> 08:34.764
YOU WERE GONNA SAY,

08:34.806 --> 08:38.559
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY I'VE BEEN

08:34.806 --> 08:38.559
NERVOUS TO SAY ANYTHING.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.562
SO... WE CAN STAY FRIENDS?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.564
OF COURSE.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.564
ALL GOOD. NO WORRIES.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.650
CAN SOMEONE HAND ME

08:43.606 --> 08:45.650
MY CONDOM BACK, PLEASE?

08:45.692 --> 08:49.237
OKAY, GOOD. AND YOU DON'T FEEL

08:45.692 --> 08:49.237

08:49.279 --> 08:51.448
I LIKE DOING STUFF FOR YOU.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.573
ARE YOU SURE?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.741
YEAH, IT'S TOTALLY COOL.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.120
NOW I GOTTA GO BUY

08:53.783 --> 08:57.120

08:58.205 --> 08:59.247
(chirps)

08:59.289 --> 09:00.957
HUNGARIAN DICTIONARY STORE.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.210
(chirps)

09:00.999 --> 09:03.210
(automated female voice)

09:00.999 --> 09:03.210
I FOUND FOUR GAY BARS NEAR YOU

09:03.251 --> 09:04.585
SIMILAR TO THAT NAME.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.588
(door closes)

09:07.630 --> 09:10.758
JUNE, TAKE A SEAT.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.593
SIT.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.593
(pats countertop)

09:12.635 --> 09:14.388
SIT DOWN.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.640
I'M SITTING.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.518
OH, WONDERFUL.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.518
(sets down tumbler)

09:19.559 --> 09:21.602
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

09:21.644 --> 09:23.522
THAT YOU HAVE MARK

09:21.644 --> 09:23.522
DO THINGS FOR YOU...

09:23.563 --> 09:25.606
BECAUSE YOU LIKE

09:23.563 --> 09:25.606
HAVING HIM AROUND?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.234
BECAUSE YOU LIKE SEEING HIM?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.818
BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIM?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.820
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.820
I JUST NEEDED HELP.

09:30.862 --> 09:34.408
FROM ONLY HIM?

09:30.862 --> 09:34.408
EVERY TIME? ALWAYS MARK?

09:34.449 --> 09:36.493
I'M SUGGESTING HERE

09:34.449 --> 09:36.493
THAT YOU LIKE MARK

09:36.535 --> 09:38.619
BUT YOU'RE NOT ADMITTING IT

09:36.535 --> 09:38.619
TO YOURSELF.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.288
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.288
MARK IS MY FRIEND.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.623
I DON'T LIKE HIM

09:40.330 --> 09:42.623
ANY MORE THAN THAT.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.293
YOU ARE TALKING CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.293
YOU ARE DRUNK.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.295
OH, YEAH.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.295
I HAVE TO GET TO A.A.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.880
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.551

09:56.679 --> 09:59.640
YOU'RE ON MY PURSE!

09:56.679 --> 09:59.640
OH. SORRY.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.017
(Chloe sighs)

10:02.060 --> 10:04.645
(voice breaks) I THOUGHT

10:02.060 --> 10:04.645
MY HUSBAND WOULD NEVER FIND OUT,

10:04.687 --> 10:07.815
BUT HE OPENED UP MY CLOSET DOOR,

10:07.857 --> 10:09.859
AND THERE I WAS...

10:09.901 --> 10:11.945
(whispers) CLUTCHING THE BOTTLE.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.114
EXCUSE ME. CAN YOU, UH, DESCRIBE

10:11.986 --> 10:14.114
TO ME WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.241
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT WERE

10:14.155 --> 10:16.241
YOU DOING WITH YOUR HANDS?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.076
AND COULD YOU TALK

10:16.283 --> 10:18.076
A LITTLE LOUDER, PLEASE?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.827
I DON'T KNOW IF

10:18.118 --> 10:19.827
IT'S THE SHAME OR WHAT,

10:19.869 --> 10:22.247
BUT YOUR VOICE IS

10:19.869 --> 10:22.247
EXTREMELY SOFT.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.249
MY TURN! I WANNA TELL ONE!

10:24.291 --> 10:27.668
SO I WAS IN

10:24.291 --> 10:27.668
A FULL-ON BLACKOUT

10:27.710 --> 10:30.046
AT FAMILY FUN DAY

10:27.710 --> 10:30.046
WITH JULIANNA MARGULIES.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.549
UM... EXCUSE ME?

10:32.591 --> 10:35.552
ALLEN, CAN YOU STOP TEXTING?

10:32.591 --> 10:35.552
THAT'S REALLY RUDE.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.887
I'M SORRY. I'VE JUST HEARD YOU

10:35.594 --> 10:37.887
TELL THIS ONE BEFORE.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.847
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'VE HEARD ME

10:37.929 --> 10:39.847
TELL THIS ONE BEFORE?

10:39.889 --> 10:43.518
JULIANNA MARGULIES,

10:39.889 --> 10:43.518
BLOOD, GUACAMOLE.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.729
YOU MEAN... I'M REPEATING

10:43.560 --> 10:46.729
DRINKING STORIES?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.356
HAVE I RUN OUT OF MATERIAL?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.066
OKAY, I NEED TO HEAR

10:48.398 --> 10:50.066
FROM SOMEBODY

10:50.108 --> 10:51.692
WHO'S HAD SOME  ACTUAL  TRAUMA.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.693
WHO'S HAD TRAUMA? TRAUMA?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
TRA--ANYBODY? YOU, SIR.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.364

10:54.737 --> 10:56.364
YOU'RE WEARING,

10:56.406 --> 10:57.782
I BET YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

10:56.406 --> 10:57.782
SOME ROUGH STUFF.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.950
GO.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.453
WAIT A MINUTE. LUTHER?

11:02.745 --> 11:03.913
LUTHER FROM THE "L" TRAIN.

11:03.955 --> 11:07.292
NO.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.709
OH, YES.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.919
MNH-MNH.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.046
(chuckles)

11:13.423 --> 11:15.716
HEY. YOU DIDN'T COME BACK

11:13.423 --> 11:15.716
LAST NIGHT.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.718
IS EVERYTHING OKAY

11:15.758 --> 11:17.718
BETWEEN US?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.596
LOOK, I'M GLAD I GLAD I FINALLY

11:17.760 --> 11:19.596
TOLD YOU HOW I FEEL,

11:19.638 --> 11:21.764
AND IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING IT,

11:19.638 --> 11:21.764
IT'S BETTER I KNOW NOW.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.726
GOOD, BECAUSE OUR FRIENDSHIP

11:21.806 --> 11:25.726
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.145
AND, OF COURSE,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.729
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO FINISH

11:27.187 --> 11:28.729
PUTTING TOGETHER MY DESK.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.315
I'M DOING IT MYSELF.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.901
BUT I WAS GONNA ASK YOU IF YOU

11:30.357 --> 11:33.901
COULD SEPARATE THESE BAD BOYS?

11:33.943 --> 11:37.656
I WAS ANGRY AND I FORCED IT.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.574
MARK, GOOD NEWS.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.201
MARISA IS IN.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.828
SHE WANTS TO GO OUT

11:41.242 --> 11:43.828
THIS SATURDAY NIGHT AT 8:00.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.830
OH. OKAY, YEAH,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.830
THAT WORKS FOR ME.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.667
HO-HO! (coughs) HO-HO!

11:48.707 --> 11:50.251
YOU OKAY, JUNE?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.251
YEAH. YEAH.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.753
IT'S JUST, UM...

11:50.293 --> 11:52.753
SO HOT.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.797
I COULD ACTUALLY SUE YOU,

11:52.795 --> 11:54.797
THIS COFFEE'S SO HOT.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.756
(chuckles nervously)

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758
IN ADDITION TO BEING

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758
AN AMAZING DEEJAY,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.760
MARISA ALSO BAKES.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
WOW. SHE SOUNDS LIKE

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.972
(coughs and gags)

12:03.014 --> 12:05.684
OH, GOD! IT'S SO HOT!

12:03.014 --> 12:05.684
WHY IS IT SO HOT?

12:05.724 --> 12:07.768
(clears throat)

12:05.724 --> 12:07.768
IT BURNED THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.937
I  HAD  A ROOF, LIKE,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.937
A MINUTE AGO.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.356
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.982
YEAH. OH, YEAH.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.775
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.779
DO YOU  MIND  IF I GO OUT

12:14.817 --> 12:18.779
WITH MARISA ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

12:18.821 --> 12:19.780
HUH? DO I MIND?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.866
BECAUSE IF YOU DID MIND...

12:21.908 --> 12:23.868
I GUESS THEN I WOULD WONDER

12:21.908 --> 12:23.868
WHY  YOU MIND,

12:23.910 --> 12:24.994
SINCE WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.497
YEAH. THAT'D BE WEIRD

12:25.036 --> 12:27.497
IF I MINDED.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.874
BUT I DON'T, SO WE DON'T

12:27.539 --> 12:29.874
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.875
GREAT.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.295
I NEED YOUR HELP!

12:34.337 --> 12:37.798
WITH... RESEARCH ANALYSIS

12:34.337 --> 12:37.798
FROM HARKIN.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.384
YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH NUMBERS.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.010
AND I NEED HELP FROM YOU,

12:41.052 --> 12:42.803
AND I NEED IT...

12:42.845 --> 12:45.056

AT 8:00.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.601
REALLY?

12:47.642 --> 12:48.976
THE EXACT TIME

12:47.642 --> 12:48.976
YOU NEED MY HELP

12:49.018 --> 12:50.895
IS WHEN I'M SUPPOSED

12:49.018 --> 12:50.895
TO GO OUT ON A DATE.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.855
YES.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.814
YOU SURE?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.525
YEAH.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.817
I AM.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.818
OKAY.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.820
THEN SATURDAY AT 8:00 IT IS.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.824
PEPPER, I'M GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL

12:59.862 --> 13:03.824
THE DATE WITH MARISA. I'M SORRY.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.826
WELL, THAT'S A BUMMER.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.038
BUT THANKFULLY, MARISA IS

13:05.868 --> 13:09.038
EXTREMELY EMOTIONALLY STABLE,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.082
SO SHE'S NOT GONNA GET

13:09.080 --> 13:11.082
TOO UPSET ABOUT IT.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.876
JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SAD.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.088
GOD, SHE'S PERFECT.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.637
JAMES, YOU NEED

13:20.675 --> 13:23.637
TO LOOK AT THIS.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.639
OKAY, YOU NEED TO PUT DOWN

13:23.678 --> 13:25.639
YOUR FIBER STIX ONE

13:25.680 --> 13:26.847
AND LOOK AT THIS IMMEDIATELY.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.642
LUTHER, I'M NOT GONNA WATCH YOU

13:26.889 --> 13:28.642
PUT YOUR FINGER OVER

13:28.683 --> 13:30.851
ACTRESSES' FACES AND COME UP

13:28.683 --> 13:30.851
WITH PUNS FOR THEIR NAMES, OKAY?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.647
"WHITNEY THUMBINGS"?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.647
(laughs) NO.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.897
THIS.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.897
(taps magazine)

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
YOU WERE SPOTTED COMING OUT

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
OF AN A.A. MEETING.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.652
DAMN IT! (sighs)

13:36.899 --> 13:38.652
(exhales deeply)

13:38.693 --> 13:40.945
WHY CAN'T THE PAPARAZZI EVER

13:38.693 --> 13:40.945
CATCH ME WHEN I LOOK COOL,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.363
LIKE WHEN I'M GIVING

13:40.987 --> 13:42.363
A SHORTER GUY DIRECTIONS?

13:42.405 --> 13:43.657
MM.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.657
(cell phone rings)

13:43.698 --> 13:45.241
OH.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.241
(ring)

13:45.283 --> 13:46.867
(beep)

13:45.283 --> 13:46.867
DONNIE, I CAN EXPLAIN.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.120
EXPLAIN WHAT?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.120
HOW YOU'RE A GENIUS?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.914
DON'T BOTHER, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.914
I ALREADY KNOW.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.874
MARTY HEARD ABOUT

13:51.956 --> 13:53.874
YOU BEING IN A.A.,

13:53.916 --> 13:56.252
AND HE'S HAPPY

13:53.916 --> 13:56.252
YOU'RE FLAWED AND TORTURED.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.796
You're now on

13:56.294 --> 13:57.796
the short short list.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.130
THAT'S AMAZING!

13:57.836 --> 13:59.130
THANK YOU, DONNIE.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.881
Of course. You deserve it.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.967
ALSO, I WANTED TO

14:00.923 --> 14:02.967
KEEP YOU UP TO SPEED

14:03.009 --> 14:04.678
ON THIS THING WITH MY WIFE.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.721
TURNS OUT IT'S NOT JUST

14:04.719 --> 14:06.721
HER THYROID.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.806
It's h--

14:06.763 --> 14:07.806
(beep)

14:07.846 --> 14:08.931
I'M THE BEST!

14:08.973 --> 14:11.184
"JADA PINKIE SMITH."

14:11.225 --> 14:13.894
(laughs, speaks indistinctly)

14:11.225 --> 14:13.894
(laughs)

14:13.936 --> 14:15.980
(sighing)

14:18.149 --> 14:20.901
I JUST HAD

14:18.149 --> 14:20.901
A HUGE REVELATION.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.071
CAN IT WAIT? I'M BRAINSTORMING

14:20.943 --> 14:24.071
WILD DRINKING STORIES WITH ELI.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.616
I NEED TO COME WITH SOMETHING

14:24.113 --> 14:26.616
NEW AND OUTRAGEOUS FOR A.A.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.075
I'M LOSING MY AUDIENCE!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.202
WHAT ABOUT THIS--

14:29.243 --> 14:31.371
END A DRUNKEN FIGHT

14:29.243 --> 14:31.371
AT A GROCERY STORE

14:31.412 --> 14:33.748
BY THROWING UP

14:31.412 --> 14:33.748
ALL OVER THE PLUMS?

14:33.790 --> 14:36.209
WHY ARE ALL OF YOUR IDEA

14:33.790 --> 14:36.209
FOOD-RELATED? ARE YOU HUNGRY?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.918
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM PECKISH.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.796
MAYBE SOME BEEF?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.964
LIKE IN A SHAPE? LIKE...

14:42.006 --> 14:44.008
SHAPED BEEF?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.845
THIS IS IMPORTANT!

14:44.050 --> 14:46.845
I  DO  LIKE MARK!

14:46.886 --> 14:48.429
MM.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.429
I SABOTAGED HIS DATE

14:46.886 --> 14:48.429
WITH ANOTHER GIRL

14:48.471 --> 14:50.097
BECAUSE THE IDEA OF HIM

14:48.471 --> 14:50.097
GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE

14:50.139 --> 14:51.932
TRIGGERED SOMETHING IN ME

14:50.139 --> 14:51.932
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THERE.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.143
MM-HMM. HE'S YOUR MARK,

14:51.974 --> 14:54.143
AND NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE HIM.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.937
HER WHORE HANDS RUNNING THROUGH

14:54.185 --> 14:56.937
HIS FUZZY, CUTE HAIR.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
"I LIKE YOUR HAIR!"

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
SHUT UP! I HATE YOUR VOICE!

14:58.981 --> 15:00.400
I LIKE MARK...

15:00.441 --> 15:01.942
I GUESS AS MORE THAN A FRIEND.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.942
WHAT DO I DO?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.820
I'M GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION

15:03.862 --> 15:05.946
THAT I ASK

15:03.862 --> 15:05.946
ALL OF MY SOBER SISTERS--

15:05.988 --> 15:07.657
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

15:07.699 --> 15:08.949
WELL...

15:08.991 --> 15:10.034
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL SO NEW.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.828
AND HE PROBABLY THINKS

15:10.076 --> 15:11.828
I'M CRAZY...

15:11.870 --> 15:13.830
MM.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.830
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I TOLD HIM

15:11.870 --> 15:13.830
I LIKED HIM AS A FRIEND,

15:13.872 --> 15:15.122
AND TODAY I SABOTAGED

15:13.872 --> 15:15.122
HIS DATE.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
AND, I MEAN,

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
I'M ALL MIXED MESSAGES.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.210
LOOK, IF THERE'S ONE THING

15:17.667 --> 15:19.210
I HAVE LEARNED FROM

15:19.252 --> 15:22.547
PRETENDING TO BE SOBER IN A.A.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.547
FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.965
IT'S ALWAYS BE AUTHENTIC.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.967
LET YOUR WALLS DOWN, JUNE.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.969
GRAB A BAT

15:27.009 --> 15:28.969
AND START SWINGIN'

15:29.011 --> 15:31.013
UNTIL THOSE BRICKS COME

15:29.011 --> 15:31.013
TUMBLING DOWN.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.559
(gasps) ELI, THAT'S IT!

15:31.055 --> 15:34.559
I'VE GOT MY STORY!

15:34.601 --> 15:36.060
GO ON, GIRL! GET IT!

15:37.854 --> 15:39.773
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.983
I NEED TO BE AUTHENTIC

15:39.814 --> 15:42.983
AND HONEST ABOUT HOW I FEEL.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.571
AND MARK AND I NEED TO HAVE

15:43.025 --> 15:46.571
A GOOD, LONG TALK.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.988
WELL, I FEEL BETTER.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.700
YEAH. I'M GLAD

15:48.030 --> 15:50.700
WE FINALLY DID THAT.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.868
(door slams)

15:55.914 --> 15:57.039
SO I TOLD MARK I LIKED HIM.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.999
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

15:57.081 --> 15:58.999
WE'RE HAVING SEX.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.043
SO YOU STARTED TALKING

15:59.041 --> 16:01.043
WITH YOUR MOUTH

16:01.085 --> 16:03.003
AND YOU ENDED TALKING

16:01.085 --> 16:03.003
WITH YOUR GENITALS.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.005
I HAVE TO SAY, JUNE,

16:03.045 --> 16:05.005
I'M DEEPLY IMPRESSED.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.633
IT WAS AWFUL.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.633
YES, I KNOW.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
IT CAN BE EMOTIONALLY CONFUSING

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
AND AWFUL AND TERRIBLE.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.428
NO, NO, NO. I DON'T MEAN

16:08.134 --> 16:10.428
EMOTIONALLY AWFUL.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
I MEAN THE SEX ITSELF WAS

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
LITERALLY MECHANICALLY AWFUL.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.644
I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

16:13.514 --> 16:17.644
WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SEX IS.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.647
LIKE, BAD, SWEATY,

16:17.685 --> 16:20.647
CLUNKY, SEX.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.024
LIKE TWO BABIES

16:20.688 --> 16:24.024
HAVING INTERCOURSE.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.319
GROSS, JUNE! WHY'D YOU HAVE TO

16:24.066 --> 16:26.319
PUT THAT IMAGE IN MY HEAD?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.028
I'M ABOUT TO GO

16:26.360 --> 16:28.028
TO LITTLE LEAGUE.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.030
THAT'S MY NEW CRAZY STORY

16:28.070 --> 16:30.030
FOR A.A.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
I'M GONNA CAUSE A DRUNKEN SCENE

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
AT LITTLE LEAGUE,

16:32.074 --> 16:35.035
KISS A FATHER, AND THEN GRAB

16:32.074 --> 16:35.035
A METAL BAT OUT OF A KID'S HAND

16:35.077 --> 16:37.037
AND JUST START SWINGIN'.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.539
(clicks tongue)

16:41.125 --> 16:43.753
SORRY TO, UH,

16:41.125 --> 16:43.753
TAKE UP YOUR BREAK.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.046
I JUST KINDA THOUGHT

16:43.795 --> 16:46.046
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT...

16:46.088 --> 16:47.298
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.509
NO, IT'S GREAT.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.509
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.969
THIS IS WHAT BREAKS ARE FOR.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.052
YEAH!

16:52.094 --> 16:54.973
SO...

16:55.014 --> 16:56.140
WE DID IT.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.058
YEAH. THAT WAS SURPRISING.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.058
YEAH.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.144
(chuckles)

16:58.100 --> 17:00.144
YOU TELLING ME YOU LIKE ME

17:00.186 --> 17:02.104
AND THEN CLIMBING

17:00.186 --> 17:02.104
ON TOP OF ME...

17:02.146 --> 17:03.272
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.150
ME NEITHER. GUESS I GOT

17:03.314 --> 17:06.150
CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.109
(chuckles)

17:07.151 --> 17:09.069
AND WHAT A MOMENT.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.071
IT WAS...

17:11.113 --> 17:13.073
FANTASTIC.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.075
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.075
IT WAS FANTASTIC SEX.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.911
IT WAS!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.911
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.079
THAT WAS SOME FANTASTIC SEX.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.749
IT WAS AWFUL.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.749
THANK GOD YOU SAID IT.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.083
I  TOTALLY  AGREE.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.294
IT WAS AWFUL! SO BAD!

17:25.336 --> 17:27.714
SO  BAD! I MEAN, AND--

17:25.336 --> 17:27.714
BUT WHY WAS IT SO BAD?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
I MEAN, WE LIKE EACH OTHER.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN GOOD.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.718
I KNOW!

17:29.632 --> 17:31.718
IT--IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.760
I HAD JUST EATEN

17:31.759 --> 17:32.760
A WHOLE BUNCH

17:32.802 --> 17:34.721
OF SALT AND PEPPER SHRIMP

17:32.802 --> 17:34.721
AT HOP SONG.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.096
I WAS PUFFY.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.391
NO, IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.391
I HAD TO PEE THE WHOLE TIME.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.101
I WAS TRYING TO HOLD IT IN.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.101
THAT'S WHERE MY FOCUS WAS.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.395
I HAD TO PEE, TOO!

17:42.436 --> 17:44.772
DO YOU THINK IT WAS JUST

17:42.436 --> 17:44.772
SOME--SOME WEIRD FLUKE?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.358
MAYBE. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

17:44.814 --> 17:47.358
TRY IT AGAIN?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
WE HAVE TO. RIGHT?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
YEAH. WE HAVE TO.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.530
LET'S DO IT.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.530
GOOD.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.116
AND THIS TIME, LET'S BOTH PEE

17:52.572 --> 17:56.116
BEFORE WE MAKE LOVE.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.076
(whispers) YEAH.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.787
TERRIBLE.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.787
AWFUL.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.331
MAYBE SOME WINE WOULD

17:59.829 --> 18:02.331
HELP TAKE THE EDGE OFF?

18:02.373 --> 18:04.124
TERRIBLE.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.124
AWFUL.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.210
MAYBE WE SHOULD

18:04.166 --> 18:06.210
MIX THINGS UP,

18:06.252 --> 18:08.128
GET A LITTLE RACY,

18:08.170 --> 18:09.797
DO IT IN A PUBLIC PLACE.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.549
(rustling)

18:11.591 --> 18:14.176
(June) THAT WAS STILL TERRIBLE.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.176
(Mark) THAT SQUIRREL IS

18:11.591 --> 18:14.176
STARING INTO MY SOUL.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.179
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO GET

18:14.218 --> 18:17.179
A LITTLE RACY INDOORS?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.599
IT'S GETTING WORSE, RIGHT?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.975
WORSE AND WORSE.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.142
(door creaks)

18:22.184 --> 18:23.352
OKAY, ENOUGH.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.146
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HAVING

18:23.394 --> 18:26.146
BAD SEX,

18:26.188 --> 18:27.440
AND I'M TIRED

18:26.188 --> 18:27.440
OF HAVING TO HEAR IT

18:27.481 --> 18:29.149
WITH MY EAR PRESSED UP

18:27.481 --> 18:29.149
AGAINST THE WALL.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.985
IT IS INTERVENTION TIME.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.738
SO... AS THEY SAY IN A.A.,

18:33.780 --> 18:36.156
AREN'T YOU SICK AND TIRED

18:33.780 --> 18:36.156
OF BEING SICK AND TIRED?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.658
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY

18:37.700 --> 18:39.786
IS DOING THE SAME THING

18:37.700 --> 18:39.786
OVER AND OVER

18:39.827 --> 18:41.370
AND EXPECTING

18:39.827 --> 18:41.370
A DIFFERENT RESULT.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.538
James: CHLOE'S RIGHT.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.372
I THINK THE MOMENT

18:42.580 --> 18:43.372
I FINALLY REACHED BOTTOM

18:43.414 --> 18:45.374
WAS THE MOMENT I DECIDED

18:43.414 --> 18:45.374
TO STOP DIGGING.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.960
ZIP IT, JAMES.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.960
YOU'RE NOT DEEP.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.169
I  HAD  STARTED MAKING

18:47.001 --> 18:49.169
A HUGE DRUNKEN SCENE

18:49.211 --> 18:50.880
AT A LITTLE LEAGUE GAME,

18:50.922 --> 18:53.049
THEN THIS ONE SHOWS UP

18:50.922 --> 18:53.049
ON HIS A.A. HIGH HORSE

18:53.091 --> 18:56.176
AND TAKES THE BAT OUT OF MY HAND

18:53.091 --> 18:56.176
AND TOTALLY STORY-BLOCKS ME.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.177
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIRECTORS

18:56.218 --> 18:57.177
IN THE WORLD

18:57.219 --> 18:59.055
THINKS THAT I'VE BEEN

18:57.219 --> 18:59.055
WHERE YOU ARE, OKAY?

18:59.097 --> 19:00.180
UNTIL HE GIVES ME THAT ROLE,

19:00.222 --> 19:01.682
I'M GONNA KEEP ON WRESTLING

19:00.222 --> 19:01.682
MY DEMONS.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.184
YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN A.A.!

19:01.724 --> 19:04.184
NEITHER ARE YOU.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
I'M MORE OF A REAL FAKE

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
ALCOHOLIC THAN YOU ARE.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.230
NO, NOBODY IS BETTER

19:06.228 --> 19:08.230
AT PRETENDING THAN I AM.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.066
OKAY? I'M IN A GUILD

19:08.272 --> 19:10.066
OF PRETENDERS.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.233
UGH. I NEED A DRINK.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.987
STOP SEXING.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.987
IT DOESN'T WORK.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.905
SOMETIMES

19:14.028 --> 19:15.905
YOU REALLY WANT SOMETHING,

19:15.947 --> 19:17.573
BUT IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.199
YOU NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE

19:17.615 --> 19:19.199
TO ACCEPT

19:19.241 --> 19:20.952
THE THINGS

19:19.241 --> 19:20.952
YOU CANNOT CHANGE.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.123
(door closes)

19:25.164 --> 19:27.207
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.209
WE'LL JUST KEEP TRYING

19:29.251 --> 19:30.837
UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.296
LET'S KEEP TRYING. ABSOLUTELY.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.296
OKAY.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.214
(laughs)

19:34.256 --> 19:35.591
(clicks switch)

19:35.633 --> 19:37.426
(crying)

19:37.468 --> 19:39.137
ARE YOU...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.220
(sniffles)

19:39.178 --> 19:40.220
CRYING?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.305
(clicks switch)

19:41.347 --> 19:43.432
(sobbing)

19:41.347 --> 19:43.432
I'M JUST SO TIRED.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.602
AND THE SEX IS JUST SO BAD!

19:46.644 --> 19:49.313
IT'S ALL I WANTED FOR SO LONG,

19:46.644 --> 19:49.313
AND IT SHOULD BE GOOD,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.107
BUT IT JUST ISN'T.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.232
I KNOW.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.319
IT'S LIKE, IN THEORY,

19:52.274 --> 19:55.319
THINGS SHOULD WORK BETWEEN US.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.238
BUT IN REALITY,

19:55.361 --> 19:58.238
THEY JUST... DON'T.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.323
AND, I MEAN,

19:59.365 --> 20:01.450
SEX IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART

19:59.365 --> 20:01.450
OF A RELATIONSHIP.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.619
MAYBE WE'RE JUST

20:01.492 --> 20:03.619
NOT COMPATIBLE IN THAT WAY.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.245
YEAH.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.873
(sighs)

20:05.287 --> 20:06.873
MAYBE NOT.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.249
I'M AFRAID IF WE KEEP TRYING

20:06.914 --> 20:09.249
TO MAKE THIS WORK

20:09.291 --> 20:10.835
AND IT DOESN'T,

20:10.877 --> 20:12.503
IT'S GONNA RUIN

20:10.877 --> 20:12.503
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.963
THAT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.255
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.467
(sighs) MAYBE FOR RIGHT NOW,

20:15.297 --> 20:18.467
WE'RE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.970
YEAH.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.262
GOOD FRIENDS.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.973
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

20:24.015 --> 20:25.349
ABSOLUTELY.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.520
OH.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.356
AND HEY,

20:29.562 --> 20:32.356
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.984
MAYBE I WILL GO ON THAT DATE

20:32.398 --> 20:34.984
WITH PEPPER'S FRIEND MARISA.

20:35.026 --> 20:35.943
YEAH.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.278
I THINK THAT IS

20:35.985 --> 20:38.278
A GOOD IDEA.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.739
HEY!

20:39.780 --> 20:42.282
I DIDN'T DO

20:39.780 --> 20:42.282
MY WEIRD "HO-HO!" LAUGH.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.283
THAT'S GREAT!

20:42.324 --> 20:43.283
YEAH.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.911
(laughs)

20:44.952 --> 20:46.204
YEAH, SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

20:44.952 --> 20:46.204
THIS MARISA CHICK

20:46.245 --> 20:47.496
IS A BIT OF A FIRECRACKER.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.290
IF I COULD JUST

20:47.538 --> 20:50.290
GET MY PANTS ON FIRST...

20:50.332 --> 20:51.542
THANK YOU.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.835
(door slams)

20:56.338 --> 20:58.091
(woman) COME ON, TYLER!

20:56.338 --> 20:58.091
GET A HIT FOR MOMMY!

20:58.132 --> 21:00.467
(Chloe screaming)

21:00.509 --> 21:02.220
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.346
(screaming continues)

21:04.388 --> 21:05.514
(man) HEY. HEY! HEY! HEY!

21:05.556 --> 21:08.017
HAROLD?! HAROLD!

21:08.059 --> 21:09.727
UGH! HOLD MY CAMERA, JANINE.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.978
(Chloe) I'M CRAZY!

21:09.769 --> 21:10.978
(shouts indistinctly)

21:11.020 --> 21:12.312
(woman) HAROLD,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.312
GET AWAY FROM THAT WOMAN!

21:12.354 --> 21:14.356
I'M CRAZY!

21:14.398 --> 21:15.733
WHAT--

21:14.398 --> 21:15.733
STAY BACK!

21:15.775 --> 21:18.485
YOU GET AWAY FROM HIM,

21:15.775 --> 21:18.485
YOU  SLUT!

21:18.527 --> 21:20.029
MA'AM. MA'AM, PLEASE. PLEASE.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.029
SLUT! SLUT!

21:20.071 --> 21:21.197
(shouts indistinctly)

21:21.239 --> 21:25.325
WAH! THEY'RE GONNA LOVE THIS

21:21.239 --> 21:25.325
IN A.A.!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.577
AAH!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.577
(woman shouts indistinctly)

21:26.619 --> 21:28.204
Woman:

21:26.619 --> 21:28.204
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.204
(Chloe laughs)

21:28.246 --> 21:30.330
(Harold) I THINK SHE'S DRUNK.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.330
SHE IS--NO, YOU--

21:30.372 --> 21:31.373
WHOO!
