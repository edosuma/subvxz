Off the clock,
he called it grace.

Martha, frankly,

bring any work home with him?

in his office.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.667
Are you new to the incarnation?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.548
No.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.971
Do you ever get the sense there
was something he was hiding,

14:05.971 --> 14:08.557
something weighing
on his conscience?

14:08.557 --> 14:11.185
Me? ( laughs ) Oh, no.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.478
Warden Lacy wouldn't have
confided in me.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.397
But this was his church.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.151
Before my time.

14:19.151 --> 14:23.238
I got the sense he preferred
to, uh, pray alone.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.700
He'd drop Martha off
on Sundays,

14:26.700 --> 14:28.285
drive out to the woods.

14:28.285 --> 14:31.163
I think he considered nature
his chapel.

Died doin' what he loved.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.421

I pull the guy over.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.842
Turns out to be
your predecessor,

18:11.842 --> 18:13.093
Warden Lacy.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.054
Well, that night

18:16.054 --> 18:20.100
he told me he had
finally figured out

18:20.100 --> 18:22.269
what was wrong with Castle Rock.

18:25.397 --> 18:30.861
He said he had always thought
the devil was just a metaphor,

18:30.861 --> 18:35.324
but now he <i>knew</i>
the devil was a boy.

18:38.202 --> 18:41.038
And old Dale said he caught him,

18:41.038 --> 18:43.665
had locked the devil in a box.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.086
And from here on out,

18:48.086 --> 18:51.298
it was blue skies
and butterflies.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.718
How long ago was this?

18:56.386 --> 18:58.889
‐ ALAN: Don't let
that fuckin' kid out.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.030
DEPUTY WARDEN:
The fuck do you say

19:15.030 --> 19:16.240
to something like that?

19:19.409 --> 19:23.080
So...is it time
to call Pruitt?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.040
‐ And tell him what?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.333
( sighs )

19:28.377 --> 19:31.713
That he can add
criminal conspiracy to‐‐

19:31.713 --> 19:33.757
I don't even know what this was.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.559
‐ DEPUTY:
Ugh. Fucking fingernails.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.734
A decent man.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.530
‐ Who?
‐ Lacy.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.699
Everyone says it.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.325
Good man.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.376
So he must have had
a good reason.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.672
‐ You want me
to make it all go away?

20:20.846 --> 20:24.224
( door buzzes, opens )

20:24.224 --> 20:26.643
DEPUTY WARDEN: Get up.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.909
( inmates shouting,
indistinct )

20:42.993 --> 20:44.912
( door buzzes )

20:57.591 --> 21:00.928
‐ ( shouting intensifies )
‐ ( banging on cell doors )

21:08.894 --> 21:10.562
Go ahead and stop.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.658
What the fuck's
this little prick?

21:24.243 --> 21:26.662
Looks like you gentlemen
are double‐booked.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.288
Austerity measures.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.222
( door buzzes )

21:52.980 --> 21:54.940
LACY:
<i>Only a few others knew</i>

21:54.940 --> 21:57.484
<i>those terrible things</i>
<i>we did for our town.</i>

21:59.444 --> 22:01.572
<i>For our home.</i>

22:01.572 --> 22:05.742
<i>And, well, I pray</i>
<i>they've long since forgotten.</i>

22:18.630 --> 22:20.716
‐ Morning.
‐ Oh!

22:20.716 --> 22:25.095
There's maple syrup in here
from the Bush administration.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.472
The good Bush.

22:27.472 --> 22:31.101
( sighs )
This is as close as I had

22:31.101 --> 22:33.854
to Betty Crocker.

22:33.854 --> 22:37.649
Your birthday's still the 27th,
I assume?

22:37.649 --> 22:40.027
‐ ( laughs )
‐ Yeah.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.738
‐ My age, you get
a grace period.

22:48.202 --> 22:50.370
Happy birthday, Henry.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.836
You know...

22:57.836 --> 23:00.839
I'm older than he was.

23:00.839 --> 23:04.134
‐ Who?
‐ Dad.

23:04.134 --> 23:07.387
Older than he was when?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.014
Ever.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.186
Is that why you're here?

23:19.942 --> 23:22.736
I was thinkin' about
when you turned seven.

23:22.736 --> 23:26.406
I made a big batch
of that buttercream frosting.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.492
That was before we knew
about your lactose thing.

23:28.492 --> 23:32.663
Never seen a cake disappear
and reappear that fast.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.414
( chuckles )

23:40.921 --> 23:43.257
You probably don't
remember that.

23:47.261 --> 23:48.762
No.

24:45.027 --> 24:47.487
( car engine revving )

24:51.491 --> 24:54.620
MAN: Henry, quit
draggin your feet! Let's go!

25:07.925 --> 25:09.968
( car starts )

25:18.477 --> 25:20.020
( sighs )

25:32.449 --> 25:33.534
( pool balls clack )

25:37.412 --> 25:40.916
I know, I'm late. Sorry,
it was a whole thing.

25:40.916 --> 25:44.086
Daycare wouldn't take Bryce
for medical reasons.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.380
You know I can't leave him
with Dan, so...

25:46.380 --> 25:49.925
‐ Is he okay?
‐ He has pinkeye. Again.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.719
I swear, he gets it deliberately
just to spite me.

25:54.763 --> 25:58.725
Oh! Well, you know what
I heard from Candice?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.727
Henry Deaver is in town.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.898
‐ So?
‐ Oh, please.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.985
Miss Pre‐teen Voyeur 1991.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.654
Apparently he's a lawyer.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.824
Represents murderers.
Isn't that ironic?

26:13.824 --> 26:17.119
‐ This is filthy.
‐ WAITER: Here you go.

26:19.997 --> 26:23.417
I ordered for you
just to save some time.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.171
You know, when you called
about lunch

26:27.171 --> 26:31.633
in an actual...restaurant or...
snack bar,

26:31.633 --> 26:33.302
I assumed that
you were doing better.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.846
Oh, I'm doing great,
actually.

26:35.846 --> 26:38.390
I've sold two houses
already this month.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.142
I hope you take your
blue blockers off

26:40.142 --> 26:41.977
when you meet with clients.

26:41.977 --> 26:45.606
You know, the best cure
for social anxiety is sunlight.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.902
Okay, well,
I don't have social anxiety.

26:49.902 --> 26:54.239
Right. Your...
undiagnosed psychic affliction.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.284
There are nerves in the brain,

26:57.284 --> 26:59.578
they're called mirror neurons.

26:59.578 --> 27:01.914
And they're responsible
for empathy.

27:01.914 --> 27:05.000
‐ Are you high?
‐ What? No!

27:05.000 --> 27:07.044
No, I'm not some junkie.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.338
Right, so the Percocet
for my root canal

27:09.338 --> 27:11.256
just stole itself.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.717
I take half a pill,
once a day,

27:13.717 --> 27:16.845
just to muffle
other people's noise.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.225
Forget it. I called you...

27:21.225 --> 27:25.854
because I'm going to be
on <i>Local Color</i> next week.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.981
‐ The TV show.
‐ I'm going on to talk about

27:27.981 --> 27:30.526
the revitalization
of historic downtown,

27:30.526 --> 27:32.277
starting with the yarn mill.

27:32.277 --> 27:34.988
So I need $40,000

27:34.988 --> 27:37.199
from the equity
on Mom and Dad's house

27:37.199 --> 27:39.993
for a five‐year
commercial lease.

27:39.993 --> 27:43.872
‐ A lease on the mill?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

27:43.872 --> 27:47.084
This town
is not Great Barrington, okay?

27:47.084 --> 27:48.377
It's Fallujah.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.421
So this is your big plan?

27:51.421 --> 27:53.841
You're gonna mortgage
the only security you have

27:53.841 --> 27:55.843
so you can freeze up
on live television

27:55.843 --> 27:58.262
and flush your entire future
down the john.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.764
Do you know how many people
in this county

28:00.764 --> 28:02.724
‐ watch <i>Local Color?</i>
‐ Fortunately,

28:02.724 --> 28:05.102
the house is not yours
to mortgage, okay?

28:05.102 --> 28:06.895
Mom and Dad left
half of it to me

28:06.895 --> 28:09.022
so that I could make sure
that you don't burn it down

28:09.022 --> 28:10.691
and die in the gutter.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.151
You might have to move back in
to that house someday.

28:20.826 --> 28:23.912
I signed your name and filed
the papers this morning.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.043
Thank you for lunch.

28:35.257 --> 28:37.634
<i>( indistinct voice</i>
<i>over P. A. )</i>

28:44.892 --> 28:47.561
Shut the fuck up, will ya?

28:53.567 --> 28:55.903
What are you, a pederast?

28:58.822 --> 29:01.742
"Judge not lest you be judged."

29:13.295 --> 29:15.672
‐ ( whispers )
‐ What?

29:17.466 --> 29:20.052
Don't want to touch me.

29:21.762 --> 29:23.472
( chuckles )

29:26.266 --> 29:29.478
<i>( rockabilly playing</i>
<i>in bar )</i>

29:41.281 --> 29:43.534
TV:
<i>Five minutes remaining here</i>
<i>in the third...</i>

29:49.873 --> 29:52.626
Do the Shawshank guards
still drink here?

29:52.626 --> 29:54.837
Only drink in 37 miles.

29:54.837 --> 29:57.047
Only burger, too.

29:57.047 --> 29:59.258
What happened to
Nan's Luncheonette?

29:59.258 --> 30:02.177
You want the cover story
or the real story?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.972
Nan was running a fuck club
in the back room.

30:04.972 --> 30:08.225
‐ What?
‐ Like a swingers party?

30:08.225 --> 30:09.810
Since the nineties.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.186
Nan needed money

30:11.186 --> 30:13.814
for a titanium leg
for her nephew,

30:13.814 --> 30:16.108
so she blackmailed
one of her regulars,

30:16.108 --> 30:17.484
the governor's chief of staff‐‐

30:17.484 --> 30:18.527
Governor of Maine?

30:18.527 --> 30:20.529
Anyway, it backfired.

30:20.529 --> 30:22.531
They burned Nan out.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.408
No more fuck club.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.451
No more Nan's.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.829
No metal leg, I guess.

30:28.829 --> 30:29.955
Sad.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.876
What's the cover story?

30:35.502 --> 30:37.796
She packed it in when the town
voted to unincorporate.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.674
When was that?

30:40.674 --> 30:42.551
Two, three years?

30:42.551 --> 30:45.220
Castle Rock is literally

30:45.220 --> 30:47.097
no longer on the map.

30:52.811 --> 30:55.397
Can I ask you something?
Can I see your feet?

30:55.397 --> 30:57.941
‐ Excuse me?
‐ You're Henry Deaver, right?

30:57.941 --> 31:01.361
I heard you lost three toes.
Frostbite.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.990
No.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.785
No you didn't lose the toes,
or‐‐

31:08.785 --> 31:10.329
I'm not going to
show you my feet.

31:11.622 --> 31:13.290
I'll show you mine.

31:19.213 --> 31:23.467
You know, kids used to dress up
like you for Halloween.

31:23.467 --> 31:26.845
But then somebody
Instagrammed a photo

31:26.845 --> 31:28.847
and it became a whole thing.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.850
‐ The blackface.
‐ Okay, let's hear it.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.727
What's the story?

31:36.855 --> 31:39.733
Beloved local preacher
opens his home and his heart

31:39.733 --> 31:41.443
to poor screw‐up orphan.

31:42.486 --> 31:45.113
Weirdo kid gets weirder.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.701
Ninety‐one, mega‐snowstorm,

31:49.701 --> 31:51.537
Guinness Book shit,

31:51.537 --> 31:54.206
you lure him out
to Castle Lake,

31:54.206 --> 31:56.917
push him off the rocks...

31:56.917 --> 31:59.086
bye‐bye, Pastor Deaver.

32:01.713 --> 32:04.258
Wander out of the woods
eleven days later

32:04.258 --> 32:07.135
and pretend you can't
remember what happened.

32:09.096 --> 32:12.391
That the cover story,
or the real story?

32:14.518 --> 32:16.228
You tell me.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.357
MAN:
<i>Zaleski, tell me more</i>

32:20.357 --> 32:21.775
about
that Hallmark movie

32:21.775 --> 32:23.485
about the retard.

32:23.485 --> 32:26.613
Oh, you mean Action Jackson?
Hair trigger on the line?

32:34.413 --> 32:37.958
He died at home,
not at the lake.

32:39.293 --> 32:40.711
( clears throat )

32:40.711 --> 32:42.713
Tan jacket,
at end of the bar.

32:59.563 --> 33:00.981
Excuse me.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.087
( shoveling in distance )

33:29.718 --> 33:32.930
LACY: <i>Give a man the keys</i>
<i>to the dungeon...</i>

33:35.182 --> 33:37.976
<i>...tell him to lock up</i>
<i>the monster.</i>

33:40.020 --> 33:43.148
<i>Or pin a star on his chest.</i>

33:43.148 --> 33:45.442
<i>Call him "Sheriff."</i>

33:45.442 --> 33:47.736
<i>Maybe he succeeds a while‐‐</i>

33:47.736 --> 33:51.114
<i>a year, a decade or two</i>
<i>if he's lucky‐‐</i>

33:51.114 --> 33:54.743
<i>but evil outlasts us all.</i>

33:55.744 --> 33:58.038
Burying the evidence?

33:59.957 --> 34:02.000
Diggin' it up.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.213
Your mom's been leaving food out
for the neighborhood mutt.

34:06.213 --> 34:09.299
We buried it New Year's Day.
"Truck."

34:09.299 --> 34:13.053
( sighs ) She loved that bitch.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.638
She's got it in her head

34:14.638 --> 34:17.391
it's been nosin' through
the garbage again.

34:17.391 --> 34:20.476
Said she'd feel better
if I checked.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.728
Make sure it's still dead.

34:25.565 --> 34:28.360
This morning she...seemed fine.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.987
‐ Yeah, they call it sundowning.
Real common.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.282
Nights are hard for your mom.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.286
Have you told Doctor‐‐

34:40.121 --> 34:41.998
Uh...

34:41.998 --> 34:43.917
the‐‐the Portland guy.

34:43.917 --> 34:46.753
We go to a clinic
in Boston now.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.380
Next appointment's in November.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.007
Come on by, tell 'em yourself.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.010
You free in November?

34:59.725 --> 35:00.976
( grunts )

35:19.453 --> 35:20.746
HENRY:
Jesus Christ.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.793
( camera clicks )

35:28.795 --> 35:31.048
Don't worry about your mom,
Henry.

35:31.048 --> 35:33.509
I'm sure you're real busy
in Texas.

35:38.847 --> 35:42.434
Court made me my mother's
conservator three years ago.

35:42.434 --> 35:44.394
It means they needed
my permission

35:44.394 --> 35:46.522
before they moved
my father's grave.

35:48.815 --> 35:52.277
It also means that I say who
comes in and out of this house.

36:20.764 --> 36:23.058
( approaching footsteps )

36:24.810 --> 36:26.728
Molly?

36:26.728 --> 36:29.231
Deputy Ridgewood
needs to talk to you.

36:29.231 --> 36:31.608
‐ About the Deaver boy.
‐ Hi, Molly.

36:31.608 --> 36:34.278
We found Father Deaver.
He was barely alive,

36:34.278 --> 36:36.530
at the bottom of a cliff
at Castle Lake.

36:36.530 --> 36:37.698
Did you know that?

36:42.578 --> 36:44.580
There's a lot of folks
out in the woods tonight

36:44.580 --> 36:46.123
trying to find Henry,
and we could use

36:46.123 --> 36:47.624
all the help we can get.

36:47.624 --> 36:50.711
Did he ever say anything
about running away?

36:54.298 --> 36:57.801
Did he, uh...

36:57.801 --> 37:00.470
did he talk about
wanting to hurt his father?

37:00.470 --> 37:02.806
‐ It's not his father.
‐ MOM: Mr. Deaver is half‐dead,

37:02.806 --> 37:04.600
frozen, fighting for his life.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.018
They need to know,

37:06.018 --> 37:08.312
if that boy did it,
why he did it.

37:08.312 --> 37:10.439
‐ This isn't a manhunt.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.065
It's a search‐and‐rescue
operation.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.276
We're just trying to find Henry.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.403
It's nice and warm in here,

37:16.403 --> 37:18.655
but it's a cold night outside,

37:18.655 --> 37:21.450
and it's only getting colder.

37:22.534 --> 37:26.580
If you know something...

37:26.580 --> 37:29.625
where Henry might
have run off to...?

37:33.086 --> 37:35.172
MOLLY:
I don't know anything.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.551
Okay, then.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.579
( Henry sighs )

38:17.798 --> 38:20.092
( phone chiming )

38:22.845 --> 38:24.263
( chiming stops )

38:24.263 --> 38:26.431
ZALESKI:
<i>I really can't talk to you.</i>

38:27.975 --> 38:30.477
Then you shouldn't
have called me.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.148
That was you, right?

38:41.655 --> 38:43.615
ZALESKI: I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.450
That douchebag from corporate

38:45.450 --> 38:47.035
took him out of the infirmary
last night

38:47.035 --> 38:48.662
and walked him down to solitary.

38:48.662 --> 38:50.330
Jesus Christ.

38:52.165 --> 38:56.086
This town, they‐‐they should
pave over the whole damn county.

39:00.048 --> 39:02.176
I'll file <i>habeas</i> in the morning.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.761
State's attorney.
Actually, no. Governor first,

39:04.761 --> 39:06.305
and then the S. A.

39:06.305 --> 39:07.931
We'll make sure you have
whistleblower protection

39:07.931 --> 39:09.183
before they depose you.

39:09.183 --> 39:10.601
Wh‐‐Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:10.601 --> 39:12.269
Depose me, like, to a judge?

39:12.269 --> 39:14.605
Oh, no.
It's‐it's‐it's‐it's anonymous.

39:14.605 --> 39:15.814
You're protected.

39:15.814 --> 39:17.733
I'm barely sleeping as it is.

39:17.733 --> 39:20.110
I almost discharged my weapon
on a C. O. yesterday.

39:20.110 --> 39:22.029
‐ Listen‐‐
‐ I'm gonna lose my job!

39:22.029 --> 39:24.823
I'll lose my...
fuckin' healthcare.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.491
There's a breast pump
in the back,

39:26.491 --> 39:28.202
my wife is giving birth
in a month.

39:28.202 --> 39:29.870
Do you think
I would be working at a prison

39:29.870 --> 39:31.288
if there was
a fuckin' Walmart

39:31.288 --> 39:33.540
within 60 miles of here?

39:33.540 --> 39:36.168
I did my part, I am done.

39:36.168 --> 39:38.212
He asked <i>for you.</i>

39:42.508 --> 39:44.801
I need proof he exists.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.929
‐ ( scoffs )
Forget getting in there.

39:46.929 --> 39:49.306
You are on <i>every</i> kind of list.

39:49.306 --> 39:52.601
It would take an act of God
to get you in that prison.

39:59.358 --> 40:00.734
Thank you.

40:02.903 --> 40:05.239
