00:07.425 --> 00:10.087
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.926
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.259
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.883
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:19.061 --> 00:21.973
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.607 --> 00:25.269

fast enough to stop them.

how to steal Zoom's speed.

That might take longer than we thought.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.531
HARRISON: Why's that?
CAITLIN: Because Turtle's dead.

HARRISON: You need to ﬁgure out
what triggers your vibes.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.495

something that belongs to a breacher,

00:43.669 --> 00:45.079

01:22.500 --> 01:24.456
Uh... It didn't look this deep on the map.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.998
That's 'cause maps are ﬂat.
This is like 1,000 feet deep.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.746
Well, you wanna get faster.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.461
maybe plummeting to your death
is the motivation you need.

01:33.052 --> 01:36.294
So, to reach escape velocity,
you're gonna have to go...

-Not helpful.
-Look, Zoom's still out there.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.211
And once I ﬁnd a way back to Earth-2,
I have to be faster than him.

02:18.431 --> 02:20.012
And I mean, right now,

02:21.058 --> 02:22.594
I wasn't even fast enough to save Jay.

02:25.688 --> 02:26.677
