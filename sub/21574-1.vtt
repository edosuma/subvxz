04:04.119 --> 04:05.673
Think you could hide from me, did you?

04:05.753 --> 04:08.813
Did you read what it said? It said,
"Found you!" And it means that I tickle...

04:08.893 --> 04:12.128
Samuel. Bee. That's enough.

04:16.362 --> 04:19.285
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

04:19.365 --> 04:22.956
You sure? Good. Because now it's my turn!

04:23.036 --> 04:24.190
Dad, help!

04:24.270 --> 04:27.117
You need help? Sure, I can help tickle you.

04:28.373 --> 04:31.787
I think the bottom of these feet
might be very ticklish.

04:44.256 --> 04:46.302
Time for bed, Bee.

04:49.453 --> 04:51.306
Thank you.

04:58.335 --> 05:01.514
- Love you, Mommy.
- Love you more.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.089
Mommy?

05:14.185 --> 05:17.231
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

05:46.681 --> 05:50.172
Mommy? Can we play dollies when we get home?

05:50.252 --> 05:53.474
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up...

05:53.554 --> 05:55.977
...I could play dollies
with you all afternoon.

05:56.057 --> 05:57.398
- Sam!
- Yes!

05:57.478 --> 05:59.003
Sam!

05:59.893 --> 06:02.149
- Morning, Sam. Morning, Esther.
- Morning.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.250
Hey, there, busy Bee.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.953
Sam, just wondering if you got
that order of mine ready yet.

06:08.033 --> 06:12.042
I got customers coming into my store
every day asking about your dolls.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.629
You can send your son over
tomorrow, Vic. They're ready.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.965
Well, hallelujah. I guess prayers
do get answered, don't they?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.600
- They do.
- All right, well, thank you so much.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.761
- Y'all have a good Sunday.
- You have a good day, too.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.536
In you get.

06:31.387 --> 06:34.288
- Damn it!
- Language.

06:39.063 --> 06:42.354
There's a car coming. Why don't I wave it
down and see if we can get some help?

06:42.434 --> 06:44.645
No, no, no, no. I got it.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.324
I'll get it!

06:58.481 --> 07:00.026
No!

07:45.742 --> 07:48.416
B-L-U-E.

07:48.496 --> 07:50.743
Okay, pick a number.

07:51.832 --> 07:53.378
Linda?

07:56.403 --> 07:57.924
Four.

07:58.004 --> 07:59.515
Okay.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.719
"You will soon make new friends."

08:03.874 --> 08:05.545
Do mine now.

08:08.481 --> 08:10.293
What's wrong?

08:11.417 --> 08:15.975
I just wish you and me were going to
a new home instead of a new orphanage.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.701
Sweet Sue does, too.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.548
It'd be nice to have a home.

08:24.928 --> 08:27.453
Yeah, but only if you're there.

08:27.533 --> 08:29.582
I don't wanna go anywhere you're not.

08:31.935 --> 08:36.751
So, let's swear. If someone wants
one of us, they get both of us.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.996
Okay. I swear.

08:40.077 --> 08:41.732
Good.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.073
Me, too.

08:44.114 --> 08:46.561
You know what I like most about Sweet Sue?

08:47.118 --> 08:48.630
What?

08:50.219 --> 08:52.066
She looks just like you.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.514
So, how much further is it, Father?

08:57.594 --> 09:01.206
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
you're worse than the children, Sister.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.397
The Mullins agreeing to take us in...

09:04.477 --> 09:06.490
- ...was a gift from God.
- Yeah.

09:06.570 --> 09:09.825
What kind of person isn't excited
about getting a gift?

09:10.305 --> 09:15.065
I should mention, don't be alarmed if you
don't see much of Mrs. Mullins at first.

09:15.145 --> 09:18.948
She... has a condition, you see.

09:19.028 --> 09:21.702
She was in an accident years ago.

09:22.082 --> 09:25.164
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

10:00.454 --> 10:02.332
It's big.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.242
Janice... you need help?

10:39.322 --> 10:42.169
No, thanks. I can manage.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.986
Sister.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.389
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak...

10:53.469 --> 10:56.292
...but she's getting stronger every day.

10:56.372 --> 10:59.251
She won't be a burden. I promise you.

11:00.375 --> 11:04.067
Mr. Mullins, why don't you
show the girls around?

11:04.347 --> 11:06.592
I can unload their belongings.

11:07.382 --> 11:09.405
I'll start inside.

11:09.485 --> 11:11.583
Thank you, Father.

11:20.827 --> 11:22.885
This is big as a castle.

11:22.965 --> 11:25.553
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

11:25.633 --> 11:29.701
If this is our new orphanage, I think
I'm just fine with never being adopted.

11:32.605 --> 11:35.929
- There's a TV.
- The television no longer works.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.222
The radio, however, does.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.071
This goes on forever.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.942
You're right. We're gonna need
a map to find our way around.

11:49.022 --> 11:51.301
Girls, this way.

11:52.757 --> 11:57.232
As you can see, the dining room is more
than adequate to accommodate all of us.

12:00.764 --> 12:03.578
- Look in here.
- Let's stay together.

12:10.574 --> 12:12.694
Mrs. Mullins and I stay in here.

12:13.544 --> 12:17.101
Feel free to use the rest
of the downstairs as you see fit.

12:17.181 --> 12:19.370
Your rooms are upstairs.

12:19.750 --> 12:24.575
Mr. Mullins, is there some way Janice
and I could maybe stay down here?

12:25.155 --> 12:28.434
- Me, too.
- I'll be fine.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.460
I installed it years ago for my wife.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.696
Hasn't been used in ages.

12:47.776 --> 12:49.702
But it works fine.

12:49.912 --> 12:51.757
Try it, Jan.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.311
If you don't, I will.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.845
Up is up. Down is down.

13:03.925 --> 13:06.004
But it won't work...

13:07.308 --> 13:09.629
...unless you click the seat belt in...

13:10.798 --> 13:12.776
...like this.

13:14.268 --> 13:15.766
Simple.

13:27.013 --> 13:28.825
Thank you.

14:26.402 --> 14:28.081
I got dibs on next!

14:42.450 --> 14:44.038
Nice.

14:44.118 --> 14:46.564
I guess this is ours.

14:48.156 --> 14:50.911
Let's take that side.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.314
Kate and Tierney can have these.

14:53.394 --> 14:55.606
What about Linda and me?

14:55.929 --> 14:59.587
Relax, Janice. This is a big house.
There are other bedrooms.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.656
Why can't Linda and me
have those beds over there?

15:01.736 --> 15:05.616
Okay. But then where
would Kate and Tierney sleep?

15:13.882 --> 15:15.757
This is neat.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.430
Locked...

15:45.510 --> 15:47.722
...and it stays that way, too.

15:56.686 --> 15:59.767
Hey, Jan. In here.

16:27.315 --> 16:28.707
Hey.

16:29.784 --> 16:31.997
Wanna be bunkmates?

17:49.211 --> 17:51.681
- Hey, Sister Charlotte, can we...
- Lord...

17:51.761 --> 17:56.253
...please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people near heart attacks.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.587
Sorry.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.252
- What is your emergency?
- Can we go exploring?

18:00.332 --> 18:02.257
Help Father Massey
with your things first, and...

18:02.337 --> 18:04.794
- But Mr. Mullins is doing that.
- But that doesn't mean you're...

18:04.874 --> 18:08.354
You know how Father Massey is.
We don't wanna get in the way.

18:09.979 --> 18:12.267
- Fine.
- She said "okay"!

18:12.347 --> 18:14.592
But look out for one another!

18:18.954 --> 18:20.874
You coming, Jan?

18:20.954 --> 18:23.200
Maybe in a little while.

18:24.593 --> 18:26.104
Well...

18:26.760 --> 18:28.783
...maybe I'll stay, too.

18:28.863 --> 18:31.141
Because you feel sorry for me?

18:31.866 --> 18:33.100
Well...

18:33.180 --> 18:36.324
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

18:36.404 --> 18:37.915
Okay.

18:38.605 --> 18:40.415
See ya!

20:20.033 --> 20:24.092
Dear Lord, thank you
for bringing us all together.

20:25.172 --> 20:27.594
Bless this food for our use...

20:28.174 --> 20:30.453
...and us to thy service.

20:31.379 --> 20:34.034
Fill our hearts with grateful praise...

20:34.914 --> 20:38.728
...and help us give you glory
each day, through.

20:40.553 --> 20:43.209
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

20:43.289 --> 20:45.102
Amen.

20:55.969 --> 20:57.980
If you'll excuse me.

21:32.970 --> 21:34.481
Carol.

21:40.443 --> 21:42.655
Keep to your own business.

21:54.622 --> 21:56.964
<i>And if I die before I wake...</i>

21:57.044 --> 21:59.647
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

21:59.727 --> 22:03.352
Please, God, help Linda and me find
a good home that keeps us together.

22:03.432 --> 22:07.221
- So we can finally be real sisters.
- With good, loving parents.

22:07.301 --> 22:09.823
That hate homework as much as we do.

22:09.903 --> 22:13.369
But even if they don't, that's okay, too.

22:14.508 --> 22:16.020
Amen.

23:08.358 --> 23:10.170
"Find me"?

23:54.702 --> 23:56.003
Nancy?

23:57.204 --> 23:58.782
Carol?

23:59.505 --> 24:01.385
Are you guys in here?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.458
Forgive me, Father...

24:08.146 --> 24:10.028
...for I am about to sin.

30:51.126 --> 30:54.148
I heard this is where
Mr. Mullins keeps his wife.

30:54.858 --> 30:58.529
- Does she really wear a mask?
- Yeah, she looked like a doll.

30:59.901 --> 31:03.090
Mrs. Mullins, you down there?

31:03.170 --> 31:04.981
Stop it.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.361
I think he seems nice.

31:07.441 --> 31:10.331
Why don't you go find Janice?
See what she's up to.

31:10.411 --> 31:13.301
Why? So you can talk about boys?

31:13.381 --> 31:16.159
Well, do you wanna talk about boys?

31:16.250 --> 31:18.939
Gross. No.

31:19.019 --> 31:23.020
- I wanna play a game.
- Okay, let's play hide and seek.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.646
You go hide, and we'll come look for you.

31:25.726 --> 31:27.082
Okay.

31:32.264 --> 31:35.121
So, are we gonna look for her?

31:35.601 --> 31:37.112
Maybe.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.594
Bless you.

31:44.674 --> 31:46.664
Thank you.

31:46.744 --> 31:48.163
What are you doing?

31:48.243 --> 31:51.369
I asked Mr. Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom...

31:51.449 --> 31:53.737
...and he graciously agreed.

31:53.817 --> 31:55.630
Would you like to help?

31:57.822 --> 31:59.634
What's wrong?

32:00.823 --> 32:02.657
I have a sin to confess.

32:04.828 --> 32:07.918
Forgive me, Sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

32:08.398 --> 32:11.455
- It's been...
- At least two weeks.

32:12.335 --> 32:14.981
...at least two weeks
since my last confession.

32:17.039 --> 32:19.496
There's this room upstairs
that we're not supposed to go into.

32:19.576 --> 32:21.656
But you did anyway.

32:22.345 --> 32:24.674
- How'd you know?
- Because otherwise...

32:24.754 --> 32:27.193
...why would you be telling me about it?

32:28.717 --> 32:31.373
Well, the door was already open.

32:32.253 --> 32:36.143
I don't know how, because
Mr. Mullins always keeps it locked.

32:36.223 --> 32:38.546
When I went inside,
there was this little doll...

32:38.626 --> 32:40.982
- ...and it was really strange in there.
- Janice.

32:41.062 --> 32:44.876
- Weird things started to happen.
- Janice, listen to yourself.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.490
What do I always say?

32:49.720 --> 32:52.735
A sin is a sin, no matter the context.

32:54.209 --> 32:58.455
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.904
We only just got here and they're
doing a very generous thing...

33:02.984 --> 33:05.229
...by allowing us to stay with them.

33:06.853 --> 33:09.675
If they decide to no longer have us here...

33:09.755 --> 33:11.635
...we'll all be split up.

33:12.025 --> 33:15.414
So, next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule...

33:15.494 --> 33:19.747
...think of how that could affect
the other girls, first.

33:22.099 --> 33:25.257
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. I'm sorry, Sister. I wasn't thinking.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.182
It's okay, love.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.431
For your penance, pray one Hail Mary...

33:32.511 --> 33:35.524
...and unpack three of these boxes.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.529
What are you guys doing?

33:43.219 --> 33:45.166
Unpacking boxes.

34:33.934 --> 34:35.946
This place is so creepy.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.828
What was that?

34:56.556 --> 34:58.401
What was that?

35:04.363 --> 35:06.642
How dare you!

35:10.268 --> 35:12.314
Mr. Scarecrow.

36:25.272 --> 36:26.927
Found you.

36:27.207 --> 36:29.420
You're not very good at hiding.

36:34.848 --> 36:37.871
Years of neglect have affected
the counterbalance.

36:38.451 --> 36:41.040
There. That should keep the draft down.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.970
Thank you.

36:51.397 --> 36:55.524
That was taken in Romania
at a convent of cloister nuns.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.622
They have little contact
with the outside world...

36:57.702 --> 37:00.497
...but I became very close to these three.

37:00.577 --> 37:03.315
That's Sister Maria, that's Sister Anna...

37:03.675 --> 37:05.888
...and that's Sister Lucia.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.158
Who's this?

37:11.801 --> 37:14.148
I don't know. I don't think I even met her.

37:17.754 --> 37:21.401
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, thank you.

37:25.296 --> 37:27.107
Good night.

37:29.134 --> 37:30.977
Good night.

37:34.136 --> 37:37.427
- I like him.
- Which one would you marry?

37:38.107 --> 37:42.354
I don't know. I guess I'll just have
to date all of them to find out.

37:42.905 --> 37:44.821
I just want his eyebrows.

37:44.901 --> 37:47.560
- I love his eyes.
- He's very handsome.

38:12.272 --> 38:15.729
Night time is when Mrs. Mullins
gets her powers.

38:15.809 --> 38:18.231
That's why she's in bed all day,
but at night...

38:18.311 --> 38:21.585
...she can go wherever she wants.
She needs to...

38:21.665 --> 38:24.171
...so she can feed.

38:24.251 --> 38:26.807
And if you look directly at her, you'll die.

38:26.887 --> 38:31.110
And to get you to look, she'll keep
saying your name over and over...

38:31.190 --> 38:33.636
...till you can't stand it.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.649
Wait.

38:35.929 --> 38:38.975
Nancy. Nancy.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.287
- Nancy!
- No, Mrs. Mullins, no!

38:41.367 --> 38:42.724
Nancy.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.506
No.

39:01.786 --> 39:03.943
She's ready to feed.

39:04.223 --> 39:07.852
Carol! Carol! Carol!

39:07.932 --> 39:10.648
- Stop it. We're not supposed to be up.
- Well, you were doing it, too.

39:10.728 --> 39:12.240
Me?

39:20.437 --> 39:23.082
Okay, why isn't he answering her?

39:53.869 --> 39:56.103
- Nancy...
- Don't look at her.

39:56.183 --> 40:00.885
No! No, please, please, please!
Please! No, please.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.637
Please.

40:13.553 --> 40:15.366
She's gone.

40:16.255 --> 40:19.100
She's gone. She's gone.

40:21.459 --> 40:24.045
- What's going on?
- What on God's Earth?

40:24.125 --> 40:26.498
Miss Sister Charlotte...
Mrs. Mullins... she was here.

40:26.578 --> 40:29.309
In this room.
She was standing right over there.

40:29.389 --> 40:31.156
Who?

40:31.236 --> 40:34.926
Your wife, apparently.
They said she was just in here.

40:35.006 --> 40:39.688
That's impossible. My wife
hasn't been able to walk for years.

41:02.865 --> 41:05.527
Girls. Girls!

41:06.370 --> 41:09.015
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

41:22.284 --> 41:24.097
You okay, Nance?

41:35.063 --> 41:37.571
Did you really see Mrs. Mullins
in your room last night?

41:37.651 --> 41:41.589
- Yes. We swear. We were under the covers...
- Nancy, stop it.

41:41.669 --> 41:44.917
We just freaked ourselves out
last night. You know that.

42:01.021 --> 42:03.109
Mrs. Mullins?

42:03.189 --> 42:07.736
Sister Charlotte, could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

42:08.196 --> 42:10.006
Of course.

42:41.026 --> 42:44.628
All of you are more than welcome
to stay as long as you need.

42:45.328 --> 42:47.751
It's good to hear some life again.

42:48.601 --> 42:52.886
We've been cooped up here so long,
I'd forgotten what that sounded like.

42:55.138 --> 42:57.090
What a lovely picture.

42:57.170 --> 42:59.062
She was taken from us...

42:59.142 --> 43:02.166
...at an early age, unfortunately.

43:03.979 --> 43:06.181
If you could turn away for a moment, Sister?

43:06.581 --> 43:08.393
Yes, of course.

43:10.119 --> 43:12.865
I'm very sorry to hear about your daughter.

43:15.425 --> 43:19.538
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in Heaven.

43:20.128 --> 43:21.991
I wish that were true.

45:14.703 --> 45:16.580
Oh, my gosh.

45:18.105 --> 45:20.295
You shouldn't be in here.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.254
Well, neither should you.

45:33.286 --> 45:35.543
Whose room is this, anyways?

45:35.623 --> 45:39.236
The Mullins had a daughter. It was hers.

45:41.394 --> 45:43.549
"Had" one?

45:43.629 --> 45:45.525
I think she died.

45:48.133 --> 45:50.680
And I think that was her
playing the music, too.

45:56.141 --> 45:59.899
- Stop trying to scare me.
- I'm not. It's the truth.

45:59.979 --> 46:01.967
Then why are we in here?

46:02.047 --> 46:05.594
- We should leave.
- No. No.

46:17.630 --> 46:19.273
Linda...

46:19.529 --> 46:21.375
...what is it?

46:22.500 --> 46:24.544
We shouldn't be in here.

46:26.304 --> 46:27.881
Okay.

46:28.872 --> 46:30.594
I'll leave in a minute.

46:30.674 --> 46:32.486
Well, I'm going.

47:41.239 --> 47:43.251
Who's doing that?

48:33.922 --> 48:35.629
Hi.

48:49.270 --> 48:52.050
You're the Mullins' daughter, aren't you?

48:55.126 --> 48:56.947
What happened to you?

48:57.577 --> 48:59.391
Will you help me?

49:02.416 --> 49:04.362
What do you need?

49:07.587 --> 49:09.746
Your soul!

49:30.808 --> 49:32.466
Charlotte!

49:32.546 --> 49:34.957
Sister Charlotte!

50:46.046 --> 50:47.624
No!

52:49.464 --> 52:51.541
How do you feel?

52:52.299 --> 52:54.110
Give her some space.

52:58.271 --> 52:59.793
Girls...

53:00.773 --> 53:04.901
...Janice is feeling a little down right now
so we need to do what we can to support her.

53:06.078 --> 53:08.567
Time, I think, is all she needs.

53:09.047 --> 53:12.148
She'll walk again though, right?

53:13.051 --> 53:14.997
We'll have to see.

53:16.621 --> 53:20.240
You need sleep.
That's gonna help you with the healing.

53:20.976 --> 53:23.584
I can't stay here, Sister Charlotte.

53:24.295 --> 53:27.432
We can't stay here. We need to leave.

53:27.832 --> 53:31.105
Leave? And go where?

53:33.704 --> 53:36.384
There isn't anywhere else for us to go.

53:37.108 --> 53:39.952
I didn't fall down those stairs.

53:40.777 --> 53:42.589
Something threw me.

53:43.313 --> 53:45.124
What do you mean?

53:47.617 --> 53:49.705
You always say that...

53:49.785 --> 53:52.607
...even though we can't see God, we can...

53:52.687 --> 53:54.777
...we can feel his presence.

53:55.457 --> 53:57.009
Well...

53:57.364 --> 54:00.870
...in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

54:01.430 --> 54:03.275
What kind?

54:07.202 --> 54:08.928
An evil one.

54:09.338 --> 54:12.594
It's coming after me. Coming after my soul.

54:12.674 --> 54:16.331
- Your soul?
- Because I'm the weakest.

54:16.411 --> 54:18.316
No, darling.

54:18.396 --> 54:19.851
Listen...

54:19.931 --> 54:22.537
...the devil preys on those weak in faith...

54:22.617 --> 54:25.021
...not weak of flesh or bone.

54:25.101 --> 54:28.732
You are as strong as any of us, Janice.

54:30.323 --> 54:32.069
Stronger.

54:48.507 --> 54:50.521
You're quiet, Samuel.

54:52.011 --> 54:54.067
I think it was a mistake...

54:54.847 --> 54:57.127
...to bring the girls here.

54:58.116 --> 54:59.427
Why?

55:02.019 --> 55:03.875
The girl...

55:04.155 --> 55:05.967
...the girl that fell...

55:07.141 --> 55:09.028
...maybe she didn't fall.

55:09.727 --> 55:11.272
Maybe...

55:11.930 --> 55:13.774
It was an accident.

55:14.731 --> 55:16.621
That's all it was.

55:16.701 --> 55:18.578
Accidents happen.

55:23.039 --> 55:26.086
It's been quiet for 12 years.

55:28.011 --> 55:31.067
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

55:32.047 --> 55:34.680
...instead of frightening them away.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.801
<i>You'll be better soon.</i>

55:41.191 --> 55:43.003
I don't think so.

55:45.159 --> 55:46.729
Not this time.

55:47.329 --> 55:49.208
But you have to.

55:50.532 --> 55:53.011
Pretty soon, we'll find a new home.

55:54.069 --> 55:57.896
No one's gonna want me now.
I'd just be a burden.

55:59.608 --> 56:02.287
But you swore we'd stick together.

56:02.778 --> 56:04.388
I take it back.

56:08.215 --> 56:10.021
Maybe I won't get adopted.

56:14.955 --> 56:18.180
You will. You know why?

56:19.060 --> 56:21.130
Because you're special.

56:22.595 --> 56:27.087
You're gonna get adopted
by a nice family somewhere...

56:27.367 --> 56:29.857
...and they're gonna spoil you so much.

56:30.737 --> 56:34.826
You're gonna have so many dolls that
you won't even be able to name all of them.

56:34.906 --> 56:36.530
Sure, I can.

56:36.610 --> 56:40.658
Janice one. Janice two, Janice three.

56:42.214 --> 56:43.726
Linda?

56:43.816 --> 56:45.628
Time for bed.

56:47.720 --> 56:49.875
I wish you'd come upstairs.

56:51.222 --> 56:53.200
I don't wanna sleep alone.

56:55.327 --> 56:57.105
Here.

56:57.629 --> 56:59.583
Take Becca.

56:59.663 --> 57:01.243
This way...

57:02.133 --> 57:03.879
...I'll always be with you.

57:07.238 --> 57:09.684
Then you should have Sweet Sue.

57:12.309 --> 57:14.120
Thank you.

57:17.414 --> 57:20.436
Remember, before all of this...

57:20.516 --> 57:24.687
...when we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night?

57:24.767 --> 57:27.509
And eat all the chocolate in the pantry?

57:27.589 --> 57:31.070
Father Massey was convinced that we had mice.

57:32.327 --> 57:37.085
"Oh, Lord. Please cleanse
my soul of all my sins...

57:37.165 --> 57:39.390
"...and cleanse our house...

57:39.470 --> 57:42.282
- "...of these mice!"
- "These mice!"

57:48.576 --> 57:50.786
No matter what happens...

57:52.212 --> 57:55.660
...nothing can erase all of
those things we did together.

57:58.686 --> 58:00.597
Night, Linda.

58:00.688 --> 58:02.800
Good night, Janice.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.759
A little sunlight will do you some good.

01:03:04.839 --> 01:03:07.920
I don't think the sunlight
can fix what's wrong with me.

01:03:09.111 --> 01:03:11.590
You mustn't give up hope.

01:03:12.813 --> 01:03:15.390
Hope is a home unto itself.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.252
Dwell in it,
and it will protect and keep you.

01:03:20.355 --> 01:03:22.767
What book of the Bible is that from?

01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:26.769
The book of Charlotte.

01:03:27.396 --> 01:03:30.040
But that doesn't make it any less so.

01:03:31.398 --> 01:03:33.220
Are you okay here?

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.891
The sunlight actually feels kinda nice.

01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:38.848
I told you.

01:04:16.241 --> 01:04:18.152
Sister Charlotte?

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.467
No! No, no, no!

01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:29.162
Stop, please!

01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:04.885
Janice!

01:06:07.711 --> 01:06:09.443
Janice!

01:06:11.481 --> 01:06:13.359
What's going on?

01:06:15.552 --> 01:06:19.199
- I couldn't get out.
- Are you okay?

01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:24.637
I'm fine.

01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:33.222
I'm worried about Janice.

01:06:34.002 --> 01:06:37.592
- A few nights ago, she wanted to leave.
- Why'd she wanna leave?

01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:40.228
Probably because this place is off the wall.

01:06:40.608 --> 01:06:44.366
She told me the Mullins' daughter
was coming for her.

01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:46.834
The Mullins had a daughter?

01:06:46.914 --> 01:06:49.121
She died a long time ago.

01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:51.962
So she's seeing ghosts?

01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.207
Keep your voice down.

01:06:55.657 --> 01:06:57.902
So she's seeing ghosts?

01:06:58.525 --> 01:07:00.315
I guess.

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:03.408
Well, you guys saw something.

01:07:03.831 --> 01:07:07.920
That wasn't a ghost.
Ghosts can only be of dead people.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.923
But how does that explain what you saw?

01:07:11.003 --> 01:07:13.683
Unless it really was Mrs. Mullins.

01:07:14.774 --> 01:07:18.761
Or... something was just trying to scare you.

01:07:20.011 --> 01:07:23.059
You guys are doing a good job
of that on your own.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.393
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

01:07:32.407 --> 01:07:35.130
- I don't think so.
- Of course you don't.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:37.598
You'll know what I mean when you're older.

01:07:37.728 --> 01:07:39.807
Now go, get to bed.

01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:16.118
What are you waiting for?

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:17.877
Nothing.

01:08:22.104 --> 01:08:23.915
You like it?

01:08:24.305 --> 01:08:26.118
It's nice.

01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:32.524
It's not my finest work.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.455
You seem troubled.

01:08:46.059 --> 01:08:47.871
Maybe I can help.

01:08:49.063 --> 01:08:50.687
I don't think so.

01:08:50.997 --> 01:08:54.290
Talking about the things
that bothers us, sometimes...

01:08:55.201 --> 01:08:57.279
...it's all the help we need.

01:08:58.273 --> 01:08:59.816
Well...

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.529
...it's Janice.

01:09:03.609 --> 01:09:05.656
She's acting funny.

01:09:06.846 --> 01:09:08.991
"Acting funny"?

01:09:09.781 --> 01:09:11.594
She says...

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:15.731
...she's seen your daughter.

01:09:17.956 --> 01:09:19.834
My daughter...

01:09:22.228 --> 01:09:24.792
...has been dead for a very, very long time.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.551
I know, but...

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:33.057
...you see, Janice went into her bedroom.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:35.125
She what?

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.895
She knows she wasn't supposed to, but...

01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:41.589
- ...she found this doll and...
- What doll?

01:09:41.813 --> 01:09:44.925
- The one in the white dress.
- That's impossible.

01:09:45.005 --> 01:09:48.819
That doll was hidden away.
She mustn't go near that doll.

01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:51.015
Do you understand me?

01:11:18.068 --> 01:11:20.626
Janice, I told you not to use that room.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:23.307
<i>Please don't take</i>

01:11:23.387 --> 01:11:26.645
<i>My sunshine away</i>

01:12:06.914 --> 01:12:08.726
Stay here.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.430
Mr. Mullins?

01:12:18.007 --> 01:12:20.083
Mr. Mullins, are you okay?

01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:40.733
Go get ready for bed, girls.

01:12:40.813 --> 01:12:42.825
I need to speak to Mrs. Mullins.

01:15:52.659 --> 01:15:55.472
Linda, what are you doing?

01:15:55.946 --> 01:16:00.226
This doll... it's hurting Janice,
and it killed Mr. Mullins.

01:16:00.665 --> 01:16:02.744
I'm getting rid of it!

01:16:09.508 --> 01:16:11.721
Linda, let's go back.

01:16:26.324 --> 01:16:27.836
Linda?

01:16:34.765 --> 01:16:37.409
No! No!

01:16:54.451 --> 01:16:57.294
- What is that?
- Who cares? Run!

01:17:07.029 --> 01:17:09.607
Janice. Janice, I got rid of it.

01:17:09.687 --> 01:17:11.711
I got rid of the doll.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:17.087
Janice? Janice?

01:17:17.307 --> 01:17:19.042
- What's going on?
- Where's Janice?

01:17:19.122 --> 01:17:22.940
- I don't know.
- Go find her. Hurry!

01:17:28.183 --> 01:17:29.456
What's going on?

01:17:29.536 --> 01:17:32.597
No! No! Get that thing away from me!

01:17:35.489 --> 01:17:38.979
It's back. I knew it was back.

01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:41.070
What is it?

01:17:41.595 --> 01:17:43.407
The evil.

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.143
The devil itself.

01:17:47.235 --> 01:17:49.045
What are you talking about?

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:53.560
After Samuel and I lost our daughter...

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:57.120
...we prayed and promised our devotion to...

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.795
...whatever power would allow us to...

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:03.876
...speak or see our beloved girl again.

01:18:04.618 --> 01:18:07.462
<i>It started small, the contact.</i>

01:18:13.425 --> 01:18:17.515
<i>But it was her... our busy Bee.</i>

01:18:17.595 --> 01:18:19.418
<i>We knew it was her.</i>

01:18:20.898 --> 01:18:23.554
<i>She wanted permission
to move into the doll...</i>

01:18:23.634 --> 01:18:26.280
<i>...so she could be with us forever.</i>

01:18:38.898 --> 01:18:43.631
<i>We said "yes,"
and that's when it became stronger.</i>

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.075
<i>Soon, we could actually see her.</i>

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.603
<i>Only in fleeting glimpses, but it was enough.</i>

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:56.420
<i>Our beloved Bee...</i>

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.307
<i>...our darling.</i>

01:18:58.387 --> 01:18:59.961
Annabelle?

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.298
<i>Even though I couldn't hold her...</i>

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:13.725
<i>...it was comforting just to have
the buzz of activity again.</i>

01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:22.567
<i>But we soon realized
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.</i>

01:20:25.116 --> 01:20:26.428
Esther?

01:20:27.251 --> 01:20:28.763
Esther?

01:20:41.147 --> 01:20:44.886
It was a demonic presence,
and it was using our Annabelle...

01:20:44.966 --> 01:20:48.656
...to manipulate us into giving it
a soul it could inhabit.

01:20:48.736 --> 01:20:50.666
It tried to take mine...

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:53.369
...but Samuel reached out to the Church.

01:20:54.409 --> 01:20:56.030
They saved my soul...

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:58.720
...but the evil
was still attached to that doll.

01:21:00.514 --> 01:21:02.904
So we locked it away...

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:06.031
<i>...where it could be surrounded
by the word of God.</i>

01:21:50.129 --> 01:21:52.985
It was quiet for all these years.

01:21:53.465 --> 01:21:56.309
I thought the evil was contained.

01:21:57.302 --> 01:22:00.857
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

01:22:00.937 --> 01:22:04.584
But we ended up giving it
just what it wanted.

01:22:17.387 --> 01:22:18.899
Janice.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.083
She can walk.

01:22:26.163 --> 01:22:28.441
It's just us, Janice.

01:22:29.296 --> 01:22:31.844
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:41.329
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte! It's Janice.

01:22:41.409 --> 01:22:43.167
- She did this to me.
- Look what she did!

01:22:43.247 --> 01:22:44.966
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

01:22:45.046 --> 01:22:47.125
And stay together.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.932
They're on the way. Let's get somewhere safe.

01:22:59.226 --> 01:23:03.053
- What do we do?
- We can't just leave her here, can we?

01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:16.921
Mrs. Mullins?

01:23:19.146 --> 01:23:20.957
Mrs. Mullins?

01:23:22.682 --> 01:23:24.559
Mrs. Mullins?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.122
Girls!

01:23:44.202 --> 01:23:46.646
Let's go. Now!

01:23:49.806 --> 01:23:53.620
Forgive me, Sister, for I have sinned.

01:24:23.705 --> 01:24:26.518
- Charlotte! Charlotte!
- Let's go!

01:24:29.795 --> 01:24:31.307
Linda!

01:24:33.284 --> 01:24:35.837
Go, Kate! Get help!

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:37.428
Or...

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.911
...you could help me.

01:24:52.198 --> 01:24:54.011
The truck!

01:24:54.468 --> 01:24:56.879
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:58.503 --> 01:25:01.918
- Come in. Close the door, close the door!
- Come on! Go!

01:25:09.081 --> 01:25:11.446
- No!
- Go! Go!

01:25:11.526 --> 01:25:12.994
Go!

01:25:14.754 --> 01:25:16.266
Look.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:19.511
- No!
- Hurry!

01:25:19.591 --> 01:25:21.869
- I'm trying!
- It's there!

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.190
- It's not moving.
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:32.812
Guys!

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:38.863
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

01:25:38.943 --> 01:25:42.023
- The scarecrow.
- What scarecrow?

01:25:43.414 --> 01:25:44.926
What?

01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:49.110
- Kate!
- Get out!

01:26:08.469 --> 01:26:10.951
The barn! The barn!

01:26:15.743 --> 01:26:17.256
Carol.

01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:21.560
What?

01:26:24.219 --> 01:26:28.444
No! No! Nancy, I can't get
the door open. Is it locked?

01:26:28.524 --> 01:26:30.355
Can you get it from your side?

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.105
Girls?

01:26:33.795 --> 01:26:35.407
Nancy?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:27:59.936
No.

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:10.127
No. No, no, no, no!

01:29:29.293 --> 01:29:33.784
Lord, help me. Lord, help. Help.

01:29:35.068 --> 01:29:37.910
Carol, it's me. It's just me.

01:29:38.601 --> 01:29:40.162
Come on.

01:29:45.775 --> 01:29:47.320
Linda?

01:31:51.391 --> 01:31:52.970
Shoot.

01:32:05.306 --> 01:32:06.817
No!

01:32:08.609 --> 01:32:10.217
No!

01:33:27.082 --> 01:33:28.894
Sister Charlotte?

01:33:55.176 --> 01:33:58.256
You know what I like most about Sweet Sue?

01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:05.561
She looks just like you.

01:34:42.954 --> 01:34:44.532
Linda?

01:34:45.923 --> 01:34:48.190
Where are you, Linda?

01:34:52.062 --> 01:34:53.177
Linda?

01:35:04.907 --> 01:35:06.595
Linda?

01:35:06.675 --> 01:35:08.886
Come out and play.

01:35:33.901 --> 01:35:35.746
Found you!

01:35:37.938 --> 01:35:39.940
You swore that if I found a home,
you'd come, too.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.020
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.923
- You go straight to hell.
- Janice!

01:35:52.435 --> 01:35:53.903
Forgive me.

01:35:54.753 --> 01:35:56.264
No!

01:35:57.656 --> 01:36:00.800
Let me out! Let me out!

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.505
Let me out!

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.705
Go!

01:36:45.035 --> 01:36:46.547
Go!

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:58.023
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

01:38:36.657 --> 01:38:38.245
Anything?

01:38:38.575 --> 01:38:40.325
I'm afraid not.

01:38:40.405 --> 01:38:42.621
Still no sign of the girl.

01:38:42.712 --> 01:38:44.590
But at her age...

01:38:45.147 --> 01:38:47.225
...how far could she have gone?

01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:51.129
Don't worry.

01:38:51.621 --> 01:38:53.498
We'll find her.

01:39:00.328 --> 01:39:05.361
The house is blessed.
Whatever evil was here is no longer.

01:39:06.634 --> 01:39:08.188
But...

01:39:08.268 --> 01:39:09.958
...the doll.

01:39:10.038 --> 01:39:12.843
It was a conduit for the evil.

01:39:12.923 --> 01:39:15.130
That evil has moved on.

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:17.864
Now the doll is just a doll.

01:39:17.944 --> 01:39:19.453
So...

01:39:20.182 --> 01:39:22.413
...which one of you gets this?

01:39:47.672 --> 01:39:49.515
How are you holding up?

01:39:51.809 --> 01:39:53.622
I'm okay.

01:39:56.248 --> 01:39:59.662
You know, that wasn't Janice
back there. That was...

01:40:01.151 --> 01:40:02.964
...something else.

01:40:06.974 --> 01:40:08.786
I know.

01:40:48.395 --> 01:40:53.021
Hi, there. Welcome.
Let's go right inside, shall we?

01:40:55.603 --> 01:41:00.160
She mostly keeps to herself and can be
a bit quiet, but she's a lovely girl.

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.519
She's just been through a lot.

01:41:03.777 --> 01:41:05.855
I think you will love her.

01:41:08.481 --> 01:41:10.222
Hello.

01:41:10.302 --> 01:41:12.779
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

01:41:15.255 --> 01:41:18.701
I wanna introduce you
to Mr. and Mrs. Higgins.

01:41:20.727 --> 01:41:23.265
And you must be...

01:41:23.345 --> 01:41:25.466
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle?

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.644
What a lovely name.

01:41:28.866 --> 01:41:30.946
We brought you a present.

01:41:34.171 --> 01:41:36.185
I hope you like dolls.

01:42:23.251 --> 01:42:24.940
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.392
What is it?

01:42:26.472 --> 01:42:28.476
- You stay here.
- No, no, no! No, wait!

01:42:28.556 --> 01:42:31.477
It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.
I'm just gonna take a quick look.

01:42:31.557 --> 01:42:33.371
Call the police.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.853
- Annabelle!
- Hi, Mom.

01:43:12.365 --> 01:43:13.910
John?
