18:21.600 --> 18:22.800
YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.800
A MAN WITH HIS FEET PLANTED
FIRMLY ON THE GROUND.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.834
CODY MARTIN!

18:32.000 --> 18:33.233
WHOA!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.734
WHOA!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.100
CODY! CODY!

18:44.100 --> 18:45.967
CODY! CODY!

18:45.967 --> 18:47.400
CODY! CODY!

18:47.400 --> 18:51.200
CODY! CODY!
CODY! CODY!

19:07.000 --> 19:09.600
WELL, AT LEAST YOU WERE
WEARING YOUR HELMET,
AND, UH...

19:09.600 --> 19:11.100
PADDED UNDERWEAR.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.200
WELL...

19:15.200 --> 19:17.033
NOW THAT I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION

19:17.033 --> 19:18.100
WITH THAT
EXCITING ENTRANCE,

19:18.100 --> 19:20.867
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON
WHAT REALLY MATTERS.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.000
THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

19:22.000 --> 19:23.500
WHEN YOU
HIT THE WALL?

19:25.867 --> 19:27.200
NO.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.600
THE ISSUES.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.133
STARTING WITH ACADEMICS.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.000
[CROWD BOOS]

19:34.133 --> 19:36.100
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GET
A BAD GRADE

19:36.100 --> 19:37.300
ON AN ASSIGNMENT,

19:37.300 --> 19:39.033
YOU SHOULD GET
ANOTHER CHANCE.

19:39.033 --> 19:41.100
OH, THAT'S JUST...

19:42.400 --> 19:44.700
NOT A BAD IDEA
ACTUALLY.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.400
AND IF WE GET NERVOUS
DURING A TEST,

19:46.400 --> 19:48.033
CAN WE ALL BRING
OUR BLANKIES?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.100
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.300
THAT'S OK.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.467
I'LL SHOW IT
TO YOU LATER.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.233
AND WE SHOULD LET
LOCAL RESTAURANTS

20:00.233 --> 20:01.934
OPEN UP FOOD STANDS
AT LUNCH

20:01.934 --> 20:03.734
SO WE CAN HAVE
MORE VARIETY.

20:03.734 --> 20:06.000
I'D GO FOR
A TACO STAND.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
YEAH. EVERYONE CAN WEAR
THEIR FEETY PAJAMAS, TOO.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.867
I'M A FAN OF
THE FEETY PAJAMAS
BECAUSE THEY'RE WARM.

20:15.867 --> 20:17.600
YOU KNOW, MOST OF
YOUR BODY HEAT

20:17.600 --> 20:19.667
ESCAPES FROM
YOUR HEAD AND YOUR FEET.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.834
WELL, I WANT TO
ESCAPE FROM THIS SPEECH.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.967
CODY, THROW IN
THE TOWEL.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.300
GET IT?

20:27.300 --> 20:29.133
TOWEL? THROWING?

20:31.100 --> 20:32.600
AND AT THE END
OF THE DAY--

20:32.600 --> 20:34.467
WE CAN GRAB
OUR BLANKIE
AND GO NITE NITE.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.500
HEY! QUIT
PICKING ON HIM!

20:39.500 --> 20:41.367
YOU'VE BEEN PICKING
ON HIM ALL WEEK.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.100
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE'S MY BROTHER.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.133
IT'S MY JOB.

20:44.133 --> 20:45.767
YOU'VE GOTTA
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

20:45.767 --> 20:47.300
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.133
LOOK, CODY ACTUALLY HAS
SOME GREAT IDEAS.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.700
I GOT NOTHING.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.200
WHAT ABOUT ICE CREAM
AND SKATE PARKS?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.300
YEAH?
YEAH?

20:57.300 --> 20:58.500
LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.300
WHAT, DO YOU STILL BELIEVE
IN THE TOOTH FAIRY?

21:02.467 --> 21:04.100
YOU PEOPLE
WOULD BE LUCKY

21:04.100 --> 21:05.033
TO HAVE CODY
AS YOUR PRESIDENT.

21:05.033 --> 21:07.600
VOTE FOR CODY,
OR DON'T VOTE

21:07.600 --> 21:09.400
BECAUSE I'M WITHDRAWING
FROM THE RACE.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.867
ZACH'S RIGHT.
LET'S NOT VOTE.

21:11.867 --> 21:12.834
YEAH.
YEAH.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.467
OK. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

21:14.467 --> 21:16.967
VOTE, BUT VOTE FOR CODY.

21:16.967 --> 21:19.133
WELL, I FOR ONE AM--

21:21.100 --> 21:22.400
VOTING FOR CODY.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.133
YOU DON'T
GO TO SCHOOL HERE.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.500
OH. WELL, IF I WENT
TO SCHOOL HERE,

21:25.500 --> 21:27.033
I'D VOTE FOR CODY.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.200
COME ON.
SAY IT WITH ME.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.400
CODY!

21:31.400 --> 21:35.934
CODY! CODY! CODY!
CODY! CODY!

21:35.934 --> 21:37.900
NONE OF YOU
ARE GETTING SHOWER CAPS.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.934
THANK YOU.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.200
THANK YOU.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.834
THANKS. SORRY ABOUT
THE MUSTACHE.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.600
SORRY ABOUT
THE BLANKIE PICTURE.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.100
CODY, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW,

21:50.100 --> 21:51.400
I'M VOTING FOR YOU.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.400
WILL YOU MAKE ME
YOUR QUEEN?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.100
HOW ABOUT
A HALL MONITOR?

21:55.100 --> 21:56.300
CAN I WEAR A CROWN?

21:56.300 --> 21:57.734
YES.
DONE.
