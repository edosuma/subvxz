00:00.066 --> 00:02.300
-Did you start dating?
-Yes.

00:02.367 --> 00:05.266
-He waved a gun at you?
-Mm-hmm.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.967
-He chased you with your children
-[scoffs]

00:09.033 --> 00:11.066
-and stole all your property.
-Correct.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.467
I've never been in trouble
until I met her.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.500

<i>This is Judy Justice.</i>

00:15.567 --> 00:17.000

00:31.433 --> 00:36.133
<i>Jessica Shaw is suing</i>
<i>her former boyfriend, Darryl Gorden,</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:38.900

[Kevin]
All rise!

00:46.367 --> 00:48.700
-Hello, Judge, we have case...
-Have a seat, please.

00:48.767 --> 00:50.734
...1015, Shaw versus Gorden.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.400
Thank you.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.166
Miss Shaw, you want to tell me
how you met the Defendant?

00:55.233 --> 00:57.133
So, I was on the city bus with my mother,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.300
we were headed to Fremont Street
in Las Vegas,

00:59.367 --> 01:02.200
and I made a statement that
Mr. Gorden was handsome,

01:02.266 --> 01:04.367
and my mom went and
gave him my phone number.

01:04.433 --> 01:06.633
-And when was that?
-This was in 2018.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.033
Exactly when in 2018?

01:09.100 --> 01:11.734
I want to say... September.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.800
What kind of work
were you doing at the time?

01:13.867 --> 01:15.400
I'm a disabled single parent.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.567
-So, you receive disability?
-[Jessica] Correct.

01:17.633 --> 01:19.700
-And that's your only source of income?
-Correct.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.900
And how long have you been
receiving disability?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.967
-Since March of 2015.
-Who do you live with?

01:24.033 --> 01:25.934
-I live with my two children.
-How old are they?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.066
Eight and ten, now.

01:27.133 --> 01:29.400
Do they get any form of disability
through you?

01:29.467 --> 01:31.066
Yes, my daughter gets SSI now.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.767
Your daughter gets SSI?

01:32.834 --> 01:34.266
Mm-hmm, and my son is pending.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.367
How much does your daughter
receive from SSI?

01:36.433 --> 01:38.734
-Seven fourteen.
-[Judy] Okay. Now,

01:38.800 --> 01:43.133
it was in September of 2018
that you met the Defendant.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.100
-Correct.
-You were driving a city bus?

01:45.166 --> 01:46.133
Yes, ma'am.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.066
How long had you been
driving a city bus?

01:48.133 --> 01:50.767
Two years and six months,
or seven months.

01:50.834 --> 01:54.000
-And what do you do now?
-I work for UPS as a driver

01:54.066 --> 01:57.333
and many other, you know, warehouse,
anything they need me to do.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.066
J-J-Just-- That's the answer.
Now you work for UPS.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.767
-Yes.
-How much after

02:02.834 --> 02:06.867
your mother gave him your number
on the city bus did he call you?

02:06.934 --> 02:08.166
Pretty much two days later.

02:08.233 --> 02:09.533
And when did you see him?

02:09.600 --> 02:10.600
The same day.

02:10.667 --> 02:11.800
Did you start dating?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.266
-I don't know what you wanna call it.
-That's accurate.

02:14.333 --> 02:18.400
Did you start seeing each other
more frequently that just this one time?

02:18.467 --> 02:19.867
-You went out? Yes.
-Yes.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.400
How much after you
started to see each other

02:22.467 --> 02:26.500
did you tell him, or ask him, if he
would co-sign for a car loan for you?

02:26.567 --> 02:28.266
-I didn't ask. I--
-[Judy] You didn't?

02:28.333 --> 02:31.633
No, he actually asked me
if I wanted him to co-sign.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.700
[Judy and Darryl laugh]

02:34.767 --> 02:36.800
-Ah, yeah, all right.
-[Judy] Miss Shaw, Miss Shaw,

02:36.867 --> 02:40.567
you have to understand that
we have to have a consistent story.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.467
That usually doesn't come up
in conversation

02:43.533 --> 02:46.100
when you're dating someone,
when you're intimate with them.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.100
"Hey, how about
I co-sign a car loan for you?"

02:49.166 --> 02:52.333
is something that usually doesn't
come up in conversation

02:52.400 --> 02:55.500
unless you're talking about,
"I need a car."

02:55.567 --> 02:57.433
We were talking about it.
What happened was,

02:57.500 --> 03:00.200
we were talking about my vehicle,
which the motor had blew--

03:00.266 --> 03:03.834
Just a second. You must have told him
you needed a vehicle.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.066
Right, but I didn't ask him to co-sign,
he offered to co-sign.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.934
Miss Shaw, I have to tell you something,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.033
you're starting off
on the wrong foot with me.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.266
Because if you say, "I need a new car,
I'm gonna go out and get a new car,"

03:15.333 --> 03:18.066
a normal reaction isn't,
"I'll co-sign it for you,"

03:18.133 --> 03:20.600
it's, "Great, I'll go and
take a look at one with you.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.100
If you want me to go shopping with you,

03:22.166 --> 03:23.834
I'll go shopping with you
for it together."

03:23.900 --> 03:26.967
But unless you say,
"I can't get a loan in my own name,"

03:27.033 --> 03:31.500
Nobody just says,
"How about I co-sign a loan for you?"

03:31.567 --> 03:34.066
Well, he knew in Vegas
I couldn't get a loan in my name--

03:34.133 --> 03:36.333
Just a second. How did he know?!

03:36.400 --> 03:38.433
Because I wasn't a Vegas resident and I--

03:38.500 --> 03:42.867
Just a second! You mean,
this guy knows the law in Las Vegas,

03:42.934 --> 03:47.033
that if you're not a Vegas resident,
you-- [laughing]

03:47.100 --> 03:50.200
-you can't get a car in your name.
-[laughs]

03:50.266 --> 03:52.233
I have to tell you something.
I'm a judge.

03:52.300 --> 03:57.233
I've been a judge for almost 40 years.
I didn't know

03:57.300 --> 04:01.767
that you had to be a resident
of a state where you buy a car--

04:01.834 --> 04:05.834
I mean, I've lived in lots of places
and I'm a Florida resident,

04:05.900 --> 04:09.467
and I've bought cars in New York,
and Connecticut and New Jersey.

04:09.533 --> 04:11.433
Do you understand?
It doesn't make sense,

04:11.500 --> 04:13.433
and if it doesn't make sense,
it's not true.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.233
And if you want to start off
on a reasonable foot with me,

04:16.300 --> 04:18.100
so far, you're not doing a good job of it.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.800
-Do you understand?
-[Jessica] Mm-hmm.

04:19.867 --> 04:21.834
-[Judy] Uh-huh is not an answer.
-Yes.

04:23.734 --> 04:28.200
[Judy] Now, how much after
you met the Defendant did you tell him

04:28.266 --> 04:31.233
that you couldn't get a car loan
in your own name

04:31.300 --> 04:33.467
because you weren't a Vegas resident?

04:33.533 --> 04:35.467
We immediately talked about it.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.467
[Judy]
You immediately talked about it?

04:37.533 --> 04:39.667
-[Jessica] Yes.
-[laughs] Fascinating!

04:39.734 --> 04:42.734
So-- Just a second. That's great,
it's great for your team.

04:42.800 --> 04:48.100
Don't shake your head. Sometimes, somebody
just takes that shovel and keeps digging.

04:48.767 --> 04:51.200
-My car was--
-So, immediately upon meeting

04:51.266 --> 04:55.867
this stranger who you got on a bus with,
with your mother,

04:55.934 --> 04:59.400
and you said, "Gee, he looks handsome,
give him my number."

04:59.467 --> 05:03.667
Immediately after you met, you said,
"The motor blew on my car,

05:03.734 --> 05:06.600
[laughing] I need you
to co-sign for a loan."

05:06.667 --> 05:11.400
Okay. Now, we're gonna move forward
because it's lunchtime

05:11.467 --> 05:14.367
and I'm gonna speed this up a little bit.

05:14.433 --> 05:18.767
He said he would sign a car loan for you
if you gave him $1,000.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.667
-Correct.
-Okay. So, that would sound to me

05:21.734 --> 05:23.734
that he really didn't trust you,
[laughing]

05:23.800 --> 05:25.867
which, that was
the first smart thing you did.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.700
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] In any event,

05:27.767 --> 05:30.400
he went, he signed for the car with you.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.467
-Where are you living? In Los Angeles?
-I live in Texas.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.333
[Judy] You live in Texas?
Are you still driving this...

05:36.400 --> 05:39.767
-what kind of car was it that you bought?
-A 2016 Dodge Caravan.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.467
-[Judy] Are you still driving it?
-They're taking it September 15th.

05:42.533 --> 05:47.033
-I filed bankruptcy.
-[laughs] So--

05:47.100 --> 05:50.000
Is what you're telling me you
haven't been paying for the car?

05:50.066 --> 05:52.300
I've been paying for it.
I'm up to date except for,

05:52.367 --> 05:54.734
I owe three months right now.
I paid it all the way up--

05:54.800 --> 05:56.500
Being up to date is not three months.

05:56.567 --> 05:59.767
If you haven't made your car payment
in three months, you're not up to date.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.100
-And ma'am, she was-- Yeah.
-[Judy] Shu-- Don--

06:02.166 --> 06:04.100
Speak not!

06:04.166 --> 06:07.667
All right, I'll shut up. [laughs]

06:07.734 --> 06:10.266
So, you're not up to date
in your car payment,

06:10.333 --> 06:13.700
you're still driving around in the car.
You filed for bankruptcy.

06:13.767 --> 06:16.800
What do you think that means?
Do you think that that means

06:16.867 --> 06:19.700
they're gonna come after his check
from UPS for the car?

06:19.767 --> 06:21.533
'Cause he's the co-signer on the car.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.200
Actually, I'm the co-signer.
He's the main buyer.

06:24.266 --> 06:25.967
-Is the car in your name?
-Yes, ma'am.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.900
[laughs] You're a real idiot!

06:27.967 --> 06:29.400
-[Darryl] Yeah.
-Just a second.

06:29.467 --> 06:32.333
-They're still gonna come after him.
-Correct.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.533
And how much is left on the loan?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.934
Fourteen thousand, I believe.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.567
[Judy] Fourteen thousand dollars
is left on the loan.

06:38.633 --> 06:41.934
So, what she has done
by filing for bankruptcy

06:42.000 --> 06:45.934
is put you in a position where
you're gonna pay this $14,000

06:46.000 --> 06:47.367
-that's left on the car.
-Yeah, and see, this--

06:47.433 --> 06:48.633
-If you have a job,
-Yes.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.500
and whatever lending institution it is,
is gonna know that as long as you work,

06:52.567 --> 06:55.934
they're gonna take ten percent out of
your salary, or whatever they can take.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.667
-Did you know that?
-[Darryl] No, ma'am.

06:57.734 --> 06:59.300
-[Judy] Well, now you know it.
-I do.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.834
-Okay. Next time, you'll...
-I will definitely...

07:01.900 --> 07:03.333
-you'll think harder.
-[stammers]

07:03.400 --> 07:05.100
[Judy] All right, so this is
what the case is about.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.500
Now-- Now that I've gotten to know
the players in the case--

07:08.567 --> 07:10.467
-Because I'm not finished with you.
-Yeah.

07:10.533 --> 07:13.400
'Cause I'm not sure that
the method that you used

07:13.467 --> 07:16.567
to try to collect your $1,000, which,
by the way, you never paid him.

07:16.633 --> 07:18.100
-Correct?
-I couldn't pay him.

07:18.166 --> 07:21.233
I don't care-- Coulda, woulda, shoulda!
My question was,

07:21.300 --> 07:22.834
-you never paid him?
-[Jessica] No.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.066
The answer is no, you never paid him.

07:25.133 --> 07:28.033
[chuckles] And when he came to collect,
according to you,

07:28.100 --> 07:31.734
he came to collect his $1,000,
'cause he had a bad feeling

07:31.800 --> 07:34.300
that he wasn't gonna get
this $1,000 from you,

07:34.367 --> 07:38.333
-he waved a gun at you? Right?
-Yes.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.834
-Lies.
-And he chased you,

07:40.900 --> 07:42.900
-with your children? Right?
-Correct. Yes.

07:42.967 --> 07:47.500
And according to you, he trespassed
in the hotel where you were staying,

07:47.567 --> 07:51.400
although you didn't see it. He came back
to the hotel where you were staying

07:51.467 --> 07:53.934
when you weren't home
and stole all your property?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.400
-Yes.
-[Judy] And it is your claim

07:56.467 --> 07:59.400
that all your property was worth $10,000.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.734
-Cause that's what your claim is.
-Correct, but a lot of it was

08:02.800 --> 08:05.433
because of the car I had forfeited
to get this car.

08:05.500 --> 08:09.533
I coulda gotten a motor in that car fixed,
but he offered to co-sign on this vehicle.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.867
-[laughs]
-[theme music playing]

08:11.934 --> 08:13.800
You wanna show me
something that's different?

08:13.867 --> 08:16.000
Is there anything different that he said
that's in--

08:16.066 --> 08:19.033
-This is attempted burglary and larceny.
-[Judy] It's attempted burglary.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.367
-That's what I'm saying.
-Don't answer her.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.834
[narrator]
<i>And later today...</i>

08:22.900 --> 08:25.100
-The check looked legitimate to you?
-Yes.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.400
[Judy]
You find out that the check is all a scam.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.700
And I assume you don't have the letter
that came along with the check?

08:30.767 --> 08:33.400
I have the letter, Your Honor,
that came with the check.

08:33.467 --> 08:34.400
-Oh.
-I obtained it from her

08:34.467 --> 08:35.467
to make sure it didn't get lost.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.133
[audience laughs]

08:40.300 --> 08:41.533
[theme music playing]

08:46.367 --> 08:49.400
[narrator]
<i>Jessica Shaw claims her ex-boyfriend,</i>

08:49.467 --> 08:54.266
<i>Darryl Gorden, did not return her property</i>
<i>or pay for DMV fees.</i>

08:54.333 --> 08:57.567
<i>Darryl is counter-suing</i>
<i>for breach of contract.</i>

08:57.633 --> 08:59.467
-Listen to me, sir.
-[Darryl] Yes, ma'am.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.900
-You pled guilty to trespass.
-Yes, that was part of the plea deal.

09:02.967 --> 09:07.166
And when you pled guilty to trespassing,
I assume it was in her motel.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.934
-Yes.
-And when you pled guilty to trespass,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.800
-there was a judge, like me--
-Is it-- Just a quick question.

09:12.867 --> 09:16.533
Is trespassing, uh,
it's attempted burglary.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.700
It gets knocked down to a trespass
after a year, a misdemeanor trespass.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.867
Oh, so you pled guilty
to attempted burglary?

09:21.934 --> 09:25.700
-Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
-Okay. So, you were charged with burglary?

09:25.767 --> 09:27.834
-Attempted, yes.
-[Judy] No, you were charged

09:27.900 --> 09:30.333
-with burglary.
-You're the judge, so yes. Yes.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.233
-You know better than me.
-You were charged with burglary.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.567
-[Darryl] Yes.
-You pled down to attempted burglary.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.200
Ye-- Okay, yes.

09:38.266 --> 09:40.600
Is there-- You want to
show me something that's different?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.400
-[Jessica] No, this is a court document.
-Just a second.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.667
Is there anything different that he said--

09:44.734 --> 09:46.633
This is attempted burglary and larceny.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.066
-It's attempted burglary.
-That's what I'm saying.

09:49.133 --> 09:52.600
Don't answer her. When you pled guilty
to attempted burglary,

09:52.667 --> 09:55.166
-you appeared before a judge, like me.
-Correct.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.667
And the judge, what they call,
allocuted you,

09:57.734 --> 10:01.066
they told you you had a right to have
a trial-- Stop playing with your papers.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.934
They told you you had a right
to have a trial.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.967
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] And the judge told you

10:05.033 --> 10:08.934
that you had a right at that trial to call
witnesses, cross examine those witnesses.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.200
And by making this plea
of attempted burglary,

10:12.266 --> 10:15.967
it was as if you went to trial, and you're
pleading guilty because you are guilty.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.066
-That's what the judge has to say.
-Right.

10:18.133 --> 10:23.233
And you said, "Yes, I did whatever I did,
I trespassed on her property.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.300
-Yes.
-And they adjourned the case,

10:25.367 --> 10:29.166
-I assume, for a probation report.
-Um, yes.

10:29.233 --> 10:32.767
And when they adjourned the case
for your probation report, Mr. Gorden,

10:32.834 --> 10:34.900
did it come back that
you had prior arrests?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.700
-No.
-[Judy] This was the only time you--

10:36.767 --> 10:38.533
I've never been in trouble
until I met her.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.633
So, the judge said, "You've never
been in trouble before."

10:41.700 --> 10:45.467
And this, and said, "It was
not between strangers, so,

10:45.533 --> 10:47.433
I'm going to give you a break.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.233
-If you keep your nose clean,
-Yeah.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.667
don't get into any trouble for..." I don't
know, how many years, two years?

10:52.734 --> 10:54.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] Two years.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.633
That after your probation is over,
the judge said

10:57.700 --> 11:01.333
that the courts would knock the case down
to a misdemeanor and dismiss it?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.367
-Yes.
-And when the judge finally rendered

11:04.433 --> 11:06.900
the judge's decision on your sentence,

11:06.967 --> 11:09.233
did the judge make an order
for restitution?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.300
-Yes, she did.
-[Judy] And in what amount

11:11.367 --> 11:13.233
did the judge fix for restitution?

11:13.300 --> 11:17.900
It's $221.90, exact in restitution,
have already been paid.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.200
And what was that for?

11:19.266 --> 11:22.767
She wanted what she'd been asking for
and the judge said provide the receipts

11:22.834 --> 11:26.934
of what you had in that Budget Suites,
so that's what she could--

11:27.000 --> 11:28.967
I don't even think you showed up, but--

11:29.033 --> 11:30.433
-[Judy] Just a second. Just a second.
-Sorry.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.300
-But you paid the restitution.
-[Darryl] I paid--

11:32.367 --> 11:33.967
Would you show me, please, Kevin,

11:34.033 --> 11:35.800
-the restitution?
-Here you go, sir.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.433
[Kevin clears throat]
You have it in sight?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.266
-Well, it's--
-Shh, say nothing.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.000
-[Darryl] Yeah.
-I'm looking.

11:48.900 --> 11:52.900
Mr. Gorden, in addition to the $221,

11:52.967 --> 11:54.900
by the way, you received that
from the court?

11:54.967 --> 11:56.934
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] You retained a lawyer?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.400
-Yes.
-Just for my own curiosity,

11:58.467 --> 11:59.800
how much did you pay the lawyer?

11:59.867 --> 12:02.700
-Ten thousand dollars, ma'am.
-Where'd you get the money from?

12:02.767 --> 12:05.333
My mom had to actually take money
out of her 401k.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.100
She took $10k out.

12:07.166 --> 12:11.567
And how much later
did the court send you the $221?

12:11.633 --> 12:13.600
Last month, I believe, mm-hmm.

12:13.667 --> 12:17.400
And when the court ordered $221,

12:17.467 --> 12:20.533
that was because you couldn't
provide receipts for any more?

12:20.600 --> 12:23.000
No, ma'am. The reason
they didn't do that is because

12:23.066 --> 12:25.800
I didn't show up at the court date
because they were supposed to

12:25.867 --> 12:27.934
do a video conference
and I never got the link.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.333
Okay. Well, that's too bad.
In any event, your lawsuit today

12:32.400 --> 12:36.867
seeks from the Defendant $10,000, and--
Because you say

12:36.934 --> 12:41.100
he took a lot of other stuff from you,
and DMV fees, and

12:41.166 --> 12:45.467
return value of property and emotional
distress and all that other stuff.

12:45.533 --> 12:49.800
Do you know how much meeting you
on that bus has cost him, so far?

12:49.867 --> 12:53.467
Do you have any idea how much
meeting you has cost him?

12:53.533 --> 12:58.000
-So far, $24,000. [scoffs]
-Yeah.

12:58.066 --> 13:03.000
Ten thousand dollars for a lawyer,
$14,000 for a car.

13:03.066 --> 13:07.100
You got the car, you declared bankruptcy,
and therefore,

13:07.166 --> 13:09.834
they're gonna take back the car,
which you're still driving.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.667
They're not taking it back 'til September,

13:11.734 --> 13:14.033
so that you can have
a nice summer with the car.

13:14.100 --> 13:18.300
Miss Shaw, from this court,
you are getting nothing.

13:18.367 --> 13:20.467
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah. Nothing!

13:20.533 --> 13:23.333
He's gonna be out $14,000,

13:23.400 --> 13:25.100
-because of you!
-But the reason I--

13:25.166 --> 13:27.600
So, your case is dismissed.
We are done here.

13:27.667 --> 13:28.867
[Kevin]
Court adjourned.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.533
[theme music playing]

13:30.600 --> 13:35.533
Well, Judge Judy is a excellent judge,
so... I grew up actually watching her,

13:35.600 --> 13:38.967
which is why I knew to keep my mouth shut
when she asked me the first time.

13:39.033 --> 13:42.900
He chased me down, uh, the highway
to try and get the vehicle back.

13:42.967 --> 13:46.467
The girl is delusional, clearly.
She's a scam artist.

13:46.533 --> 13:49.633
Before I was able to pay the $1,000,
he had already robbed me.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.967
She outsmarted me.
She's a liar, manipulator.

13:52.033 --> 13:54.166
I went to Walmart and he robbed me
while I was at Walmart.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.900
That's all I can really say about her,
nothing really good to say about her.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.400
I'm done with dating.
I-I'm good with my kids.

13:59.467 --> 14:02.800
If you run into this chick, man,
run fast, she's skilled.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.633
-He was really out of his league.
-How so?

14:06.700 --> 14:10.100
Well, first of all, she was probably
about ten years older than he was,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.266
and clearly, she knows
how to work the system.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.700
And he's a kid who clearly had
never been in trouble before

14:15.767 --> 14:21.567
and clearly, getting him to co-sign,
or even primarily sign for this car loan,

14:21.633 --> 14:24.834
she had it in her mind all the time,
she just needed a target.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.734
And I guess, the lesson
from this case is, never

14:28.800 --> 14:33.367
co-sign a loan for anyone.

14:33.433 --> 14:36.500
This poor guy didn't even know
that he was gonna be responsible.

14:36.567 --> 14:39.734
One day, six months from now,
he's gonna get his paycheck

14:39.800 --> 14:45.233
from UPS and it's gonna be shy $100,
and it's gonna go to pay off that car.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.867
And the short amount of pleasure
that he had from this woman,

14:48.934 --> 14:52.400
[laughing] if at all,
he's gonna live with until he's 50!

14:52.467 --> 14:56.834
Case #1008, Demers versus Lacroix.
Please step forward.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.300
[narrator]
<i>Gary Demers is suing his former friend,</i>

15:00.367 --> 15:04.967
<i>Laura Lacroix, for losses resulting</i>
<i>from a fraudulent check scam.</i>

15:05.033 --> 15:06.734
Mr. Demers, what kind of work do you do?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.300
Right now, I'm in between jobs

15:08.367 --> 15:10.700
'cause I'm having some health issues
taken care of.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.800
What was the last full time job
that you had?

15:12.867 --> 15:15.567
I was a manager of a warehouse

15:15.633 --> 15:19.233
that supplied all the postal offices
from Canada to New Jersey.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.100
And when did that job terminate?

15:21.166 --> 15:22.934
-January 29th.
-Of this year?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.166
-Yes.
-And how have you been

15:24.233 --> 15:25.600
supporting yourself since January?

15:25.667 --> 15:30.767
I did a lot of smart money saving
during COVID and I had a lot of hours.

15:30.834 --> 15:34.367
And I also got-- Uh, unemployment
is kind of ridiculous right now.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.367
[Gary and Judy laugh]

15:36.433 --> 15:39.500
I have to tell you that
that's an honest answer.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.767
-Yes.
-[Judy] Yes, so just for my own curiosity,

15:42.834 --> 15:45.400
when you say unemployment
is kind of ridiculous right now,

15:45.467 --> 15:47.700
those are your words,
tell me how ridiculous.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.800
-As far as what I'm bringing home a week?
-Yeah.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.467
-Nine eighty-three.
-So, you bring home

15:51.533 --> 15:53.266
-almost $1,000 a week.
-Right.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.200
-For not working.
-Exactly.

15:55.266 --> 15:58.200
And tell me how much you were making
when you worked.

15:58.266 --> 16:01.100
About $983. [laughs]
Almost $1,000 a week.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.367
-Is that right?
-[Gary] Yes.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.867
During COVID, a lot of overtime,
nobody wanted to work.

16:04.934 --> 16:08.533
I had 18 days off the entire year,
counting Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.033
-I worked all through the year.
-[exhales]

16:11.100 --> 16:12.500
Did you understand this letter?

16:12.567 --> 16:14.333
-Not really, no.
-[Judy] So you got a check

16:14.400 --> 16:17.266
from these unknown people and
it looked legitimate to you.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.433
-Yeah.
-[Judy] I really have to tell you

16:19.500 --> 16:23.500
that my eight-year-old granddaughter
could tell that this was a fake letter.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.233
[theme music playing]

16:33.834 --> 16:36.500
[narrator]
<i>Gary Demers says he was scammed</i>

16:36.567 --> 16:40.800
<i>by his friend, Laura Lacroix,</i>
<i>for depositing a fraudulent check.</i>

16:40.867 --> 16:44.133
This is what this case is about.
The Defendant was a friend of yours?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.266
-Acquaintance, yes.
-How long have you know her?

16:46.333 --> 16:48.834
-Thirty years, about.
-[audience laughs]

16:48.900 --> 16:52.900
Tell me at what point she asked you
to cash a check for her.

16:52.967 --> 16:56.000
April 11th, she approached me
with a large check.

16:56.066 --> 16:58.900
Okay. She approached you by phone,
she came to your house?

16:58.967 --> 17:00.567
-Where did it happen?
-She texted me.

17:00.633 --> 17:01.667
-Texted you?
-[Gary] Yes.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.266
-Do you have that text?
-No.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.266
-Is it on your phone?
-It could be.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.533
Would you take a look?

17:12.300 --> 17:14.400
I usually have to hold it
far away from me.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.567
Yeah, for eyes, that's towards the end.

17:16.633 --> 17:19.633
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles] Really?

17:19.700 --> 17:21.700
[chuckles] I have a contact lens in.

17:21.767 --> 17:25.700
Oh. [laughing] I know he didn't mean
the way it sounded.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.934
[all laughing]

17:34.467 --> 17:37.133
I guess it wasn't a text.
On the text, it picks up where

17:37.200 --> 17:39.166
I told her that I went to
get the check for her.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.033
Okay. Can I see it, please, Kevin?

17:41.100 --> 17:43.033
I went to Park Square with all the money.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.100
[Judy] Okay.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.867
"I was coming from Harmony.
Brother's house.

17:55.934 --> 17:59.166
"Twelve-fifty to the landlord, correct?"
Is that your rent?

18:00.233 --> 18:02.500
-Is that the amount of your rent?
-Twelve-fifty, yes.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.834
"Twelve-fifty to landlord, correct.

18:04.900 --> 18:09.367
Thousand to you, $600 to me.
Okay. So...

18:11.200 --> 18:14.133
-Based upon what I'm seeing, Miss Lacroix,
-Mm-hmm.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.800
-[Judy] you had a check.
-Yes.

18:15.867 --> 18:18.800
And you allegedly got that check,
you thought, from somebody

18:18.867 --> 18:24.433
that you had done some work for online,
or canvassing on your phone, or something.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
Somebody sent you a check,
for how much?

18:26.567 --> 18:27.767
Twenty-eight fifty.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.233
And you had no bank account
and, I gather,

18:30.300 --> 18:34.166
at least according to the Plaintiff,
you were somewhat behind on your rent.

18:34.233 --> 18:38.600
And you asked Mr. Demers
to cash the check for you.

18:38.667 --> 18:42.734
Based upon the texts that he has,
this was your arrangement.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.867
He was going to take that check
for $2,850,

18:45.934 --> 18:49.700
he was going to pay your rent of $1,250.

18:49.767 --> 18:54.600
Then he was going to keep $1,000 himself
and give you $600 in cash.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.533
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] So actually, from the $2,850,

18:58.600 --> 19:02.934
you got $1,850 and he got $1,000.
That was the arrangement.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.700
-Am I correct? Okay.
-Correct.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.867
-The check looked legitimate to you?
-Yes.

19:07.934 --> 19:10.033
You went ahead, you cashed the check
at your bank,

19:10.100 --> 19:13.400
couple of days later you find out
that the check is all a scam.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.467
It was a scam, yes.

19:14.533 --> 19:17.734
And since you have no evidence
in front of you, Miss Lacroix,

19:17.800 --> 19:20.967
I assume you don't have the letter
that came along with the check.

19:21.033 --> 19:22.767
-I have the letter, Your Honor,
-He has it.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.700
that came with the check.
I made sure I obtained it

19:24.767 --> 19:26.266
from her to make sure it didn't get lost.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.533
-[audience laughs]
-[Judy] Okay, I'd like to see it.

19:34.734 --> 19:37.367
Did you understand this letter
when you got it?

19:37.433 --> 19:39.533
-Not really, no.
-You didn't understand this letter.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.100
-So, you got a check
-Mm-hmm.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.800
from these unknown people
and it looked legitimate to you.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.533
-Yeah.
-He cashed it for you.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.800
I mean, I really have to tell you that

19:47.867 --> 19:51.300
my eight-year-old granddaughter
could tell that this was a fake letter.

19:51.367 --> 19:55.567
-Mm-hmm.
-He's out, so far, $2,800.

19:55.633 --> 19:59.867
You benefited from this scam
because your landlord got paid

19:59.934 --> 20:01.233
a month's rent, correct?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.000
-As far as I'm concerned,
-[Judy] Yes.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.133
-He didn't pay my rent.
-Your landlord got paid,

20:05.200 --> 20:08.100
that was the deal.
Your landlord got paid a month's rent.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.567
-We both got the same landlord.
-[Judy] I don't care.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.800
That was your deal with him.
Did you pay the landlord out of--?

20:12.867 --> 20:15.533
-Yes, I have the Venmo here.
-[Judy] I'd like to see it.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.100
Sarah, take a look up these people.
Okay.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.834
When you cashed the check,
you paid the landlord.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.367
Did you also give her $600 in cash?

20:28.433 --> 20:30.500
-Yes, I did. I have that document.
-Just a second.

20:30.567 --> 20:33.667
-You, in effect, gave her $1,850.
-Correct.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.834
And you kept $1,000 for yourself.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.300
Right, because she had owed me money
from the past.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.100
-That was the agreement.
-I don't care.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.767
-But you took $1,000.
-Yes, I kept $1,000. Yes, I did.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.400
You took $1,000 and spent it.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.200
No, it's probably still in the bank,
but yes, I have it.

20:47.266 --> 20:51.967
Okay, so, really, the benefit
that she got from this check

20:52.033 --> 20:54.066
-was $1,850.
-[Gary] Correct.

20:54.133 --> 20:55.867
-[Judy] And you got $1,000.
-Yes.

20:55.934 --> 20:59.233
Okay. So, what you're
asking for is $1,850.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.667
Right, because I don't know
if it's right to--

21:01.734 --> 21:04.233
Even though they took the $1,000
out that I took,

21:04.300 --> 21:07.133
that was given to me, I don't know if
that's counted as lost money now.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.266
-What you would count it as.
-[Judy laughs]

21:09.333 --> 21:10.767
But you spent the $1,000.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.900
I had it in my hand for two days, so...

21:12.967 --> 21:16.400
Did the bank take back the entire $2,800?

21:16.467 --> 21:19.000
-Yes. That's right here.
-[Judy] I'd like to see it.

21:19.066 --> 21:23.233
Um... I put in my savings.
It came out of my checking.

21:23.300 --> 21:27.100
The Better Business Bureau
has warned about this scam

21:27.166 --> 21:30.934
involving wrapping your vehicle
in advertising. It's a scam.

21:34.934 --> 21:36.200
Thank you.

21:40.166 --> 21:44.734
Your lawsuit is requesting $1,870.
And what did they charge you? Did they--

21:44.800 --> 21:47.367
Yes, the $20 is on there,
yellowed out also, for you.

21:47.433 --> 21:49.100
-[Judy] For a bad check. Okay.
-Yes.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.000
That's what your lawsuit's requesting,
you're absolutely entitled to it.

21:52.066 --> 21:54.266
Judgment for the Plaintiff
in the amount of $1,870.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.000
[Kevin]
Court's adjourned.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.567
[theme music playing]

21:59.633 --> 22:01.900
I thought it was, um, more than fair.

22:01.967 --> 22:05.433
As far as I'm concerned, I got paid $600,
if nothing else.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.600
Because this was a legitimate bank check
from Suncoast.

22:08.667 --> 22:12.367
As far as I'm concerned, I seen the check,
I showed Gary, Gary showed the bank.

22:12.433 --> 22:15.967
We all thought it was real.
I didn't bother finishin' readin' it.

22:16.033 --> 22:16.934
Well, I wasn't happy.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.133
Go to Gary,
'cause he'd probably cash 'em again.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.233
I will deposit it and
we'll wait for it to clear. [laughs]

22:24.333 --> 22:27.266
So, what advice could you give
an ordinary person

22:27.333 --> 22:30.567
for being able to tell if something
they get in the mail is a scam--

22:30.633 --> 22:33.934
You know, life usually teaches you
if something is too good to be true,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.033
-it's usually not true. [laughs]
-Yeah.

22:36.100 --> 22:40.000
And I'm not so sure that
the Plaintiff in that case

22:40.066 --> 22:45.233
didn't have some kind of clue that
this check was not a good one.

22:45.300 --> 22:48.767
I'm not certain. But he was otherwise
very truthful with me. [laughs]

22:48.834 --> 22:50.633
So, that's his flip side.

22:50.700 --> 22:54.667
I think that the lesson that's taken
from that case is,

22:54.734 --> 22:58.433
if it's too good to be true,
it's usually not true.
