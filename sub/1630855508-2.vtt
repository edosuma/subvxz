00:01.460 --> 00:03.712
<i>It's morning again
in New Utopia.</i>

00:03.712 --> 00:05.464
<i>The sun is shining.</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:07.007
<i>The goats are screaming.</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:09.843
<i>Um, and I'm still here</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.470
<i>despite the fact
that last night,</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:13.764
<i>I witnessed beloved character
actor Alan Tudyk</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:16.058
<i>get ritualistically murdered
by my dad's cult</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:17.184
<i>that I just inherited.</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:19.019
all: Fresh blood!

00:19.019 --> 00:20.354
Fresh--

00:20.354 --> 00:22.356
<i>Sure, yesterday was a lot.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.608
<i>And yeah,
part of me is terrified</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:26.735
<i>I made a huge mistake in
agreeing to be their leader.</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:29.571
<i>But I can change this place.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.281
<i>I just need to stay positive</i>

00:31.281 --> 00:32.741
<i>and try not to get
too freaked out.</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:34.117
Petey, good morning.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.119
Who the [bleep] are you?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.455
Me?
Oh, I'm a human Shih Tzu.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.165
For years,
your father trusted me

00:40.165 --> 00:41.959
to warm his bed
in the early morning hours,

00:41.959 --> 00:43.585
sort of like
a regular Shih Tzu,

00:43.585 --> 00:45.712
only I'm a person.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.215
My dad made you lay
on his feet?

00:48.215 --> 00:50.717
Your dad let me lie
on his feet.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.094
You lay an object.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.721
You lie on a man's feet
to get into heaven.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.099
Oh, boy,
it feels good to be back.

00:57.099 --> 01:00.310
There's your limb stretcher,
your pleasant bird sound maker,

01:00.310 --> 01:04.022
your Metamucil holder,
and your correspondence reader.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.608
Text from ex-fiancé Brian
reads, "Where are you?"

01:06.608 --> 01:08.652
Text from Mom reads,
"What have you done?"

01:08.652 --> 01:11.321
Text from BFF Ella reads,
"Hey, bread factory!

01:11.321 --> 01:13.156
"You forgot
your yeast infection meds

01:13.156 --> 01:14.408
"and prescription underpants.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.617
"Drop a pin, bitch.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.827
"Sorry for stealing
your fiancé

01:16.827 --> 01:18.036
and for the way
I've said all this--"

01:18.036 --> 01:20.289
That's enough, thank you.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.207
Can you please walk me now?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.895
OK, Petey,
see something normal.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.231
Oh, there you are,
Miss Sleepy Buns.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.774
We've been waiting for you.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.526
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.320
You all don't have to do that.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.362
Thank you.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.530
No pageantry?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.990
Oh, I just mean,

01:54.990 --> 01:57.159
I'm new to this whole
"being a leader" thing,

01:57.159 --> 01:58.785
so if it's cool with everybody,

01:58.785 --> 02:00.954
I'd rather skip the hoopla
and get to work.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.122
Work?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.749
Right, what does
my job look like?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.042
Job?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.586
Yes, what did
my dad do every day?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.129
We love you, Petey!

02:11.423 --> 02:13.216
Whoo, Petey!

02:13.216 --> 02:14.968
- The Great Daughter!
- Oh, my God!

02:14.968 --> 02:17.054
You're fantastic!

02:17.054 --> 02:19.848
He started
every morning like this?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.643
We always had a daily parade
to celebrate the fact

02:22.643 --> 02:24.311
that our leader woke up.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.272
Look how happy everyone is
now that they have someone

02:27.272 --> 02:29.232
to mindlessly follow again.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.652
Oh, there's
my new friend Eliza.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.445
Hey, Petey!

02:33.445 --> 02:34.821
Just throwing out
this old rug!

02:36.198 --> 02:37.532
Eliza, for a second
I thought you

02:37.532 --> 02:40.118
were throwing out a dead bod--

02:40.118 --> 02:42.245
And there it is.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.040
So my goal here is
to work with you guys

02:45.040 --> 02:46.667
to de-weirdify things.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.086
So far everything is weird,
and I'm getting overwhelmed.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.381
So is there anything normal
you can show me?

02:52.381 --> 02:54.966
This is the Speechblasters
Training Center

02:54.966 --> 02:56.635
for Public Speaking.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.845
In your speech,
I counted six "ums."

02:58.845 --> 02:59.846
Good progress.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.142
Great, this looks normal.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.187
But six is more than zero.
You know the rule.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.272
Get out the Punishment Cap!

03:09.272 --> 03:11.566
all: Punished,
punished, punished.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.902
I deserve this.
Thank you.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.278
You made a mistake.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.575
My crush.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.411
OK, say something
hot and smart.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.079
Say something hot and smart.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.665
Hey denim ass,
fancy seeing your ass and butt.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.666
Oh, bad.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.084
Wow-wee.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.878
Look who brought back
the weird cult parade.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.256
Excuse me, I did not
tell them to do this.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.382
They just did it.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.800
Nice crown.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.343
Oh, ugh.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.346
I'm un-culting the cult
from the inside.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.639
You'll see.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.975
As leader,
I'll make New Utopia normal.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.935
I'm on my way
to my dad's office.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.353
He didn't have an office.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.396
That's right.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.606
He had a Sex Hut.
- What?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.858
Strength.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.484
Inner strength.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.695
This is where your father
did all his best thinking,

03:56.695 --> 03:58.572
surrounded
by his favorite things--

03:58.572 --> 04:00.407
big leather couches
with cupholders

04:00.407 --> 04:02.868
and a private bathroom
with a loud fan.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.079
Well, I guess
none of this is as weird

04:06.079 --> 04:07.122
as it could have been.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.124
And of course,
here are his bevy

04:09.124 --> 04:10.917
of gorgeous,
pure-hearted wives.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.877
His what's up?

04:11.877 --> 04:13.628
Greetings, Cosmic Lover.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.590
I'm Wife Beth,
and I bear sausage.

04:16.590 --> 04:20.844
I'm Wife Joslyn, and I
bear applewood smoked bacon.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.263
I'm Wife Wendy, and I bear--

04:23.263 --> 04:24.556
Stop!
Mae Mae, what's happening?

04:24.556 --> 04:25.891
Hash browns.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.225
Your father liked
to start his workday

04:27.225 --> 04:29.102
with a heavy breakfast
and a light orgy.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.854
- Oh.
- We should clarify.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.523
Your father used the term
orgy very loosely.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.484
We mostly just helped him
with the TV remote

04:35.484 --> 04:38.028
and listened to him describe
movies he'd seen on airplanes.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.946
Well, I don't
want any of that.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.199
You don't want us?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.909
No, it's not you.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.368
I'm just not
a breakfast person,

04:45.368 --> 04:46.912
or an orgy person,

04:46.912 --> 04:50.290
or a parade person, really.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.584
The only thing
I need to start my day

04:52.584 --> 04:55.045
is an oat milk latte
at my desk.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.046
Is that OK?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.589
We can do that.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.382
Emmett!

04:59.382 --> 05:02.344
Petey would like
an oat milk latte.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.304
Yes, right, oat milk.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.099
An oat milk latte with a milk
that is made from oat.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.518
Yes.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.812
Super!
Now all you need is a desk.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.523
Desk, the leader requires you.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.024
Write upon us.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.442
We serve the leader.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.487
OK, stop.
Everybody stop everything.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.197
Let me make something clear.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.199
This is not
my dad's cult anymore.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.784
It's my cult.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.411
And it's not a cult,
and it's not mine,

05:28.411 --> 05:29.955
and it's everybody's.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.498
What?

05:31.498 --> 05:34.376
I hereby declare that all
the weird demeaning jobs

05:34.376 --> 05:37.295
my dad forced you
to do no longer exist.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.755
You're free.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.717
I have a vision for New Utopia,
and it is bright!

05:45.512 --> 05:46.888
What is it?

05:46.888 --> 05:50.267
Oh, that's a great question.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.935
Um...

05:51.935 --> 05:54.312
I'll deliver big speech
tonight in the town square,

05:54.312 --> 05:55.689
unveiling my vision.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.148
7:30 p. m. sharp!

05:57.148 --> 05:58.608
Be there or don't.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.069
You can do whatever
you want now.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.196
Oh, wow, I am leading.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.448
I'm a leader.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.202
Did she just fire all of us?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.370
Yes, Desk.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.872
Yes, she did.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.543
The Daily Briefing of the
High Elders will now commence.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.295
First of all,
let us congratulate

06:18.295 --> 06:20.213
Elder Belshazzar
on his new haircut.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.091
Second, this morning,

06:23.091 --> 06:25.343
the Leader laid off
our entire work force.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.970
This is a disaster!

06:26.970 --> 06:29.764
You said, once the girl
assumed leadership,

06:29.764 --> 06:32.809
she would usher in
an era of prosperity!

06:32.809 --> 06:35.312
No one clapped
for me when I got a haircut.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.730
Elders, please.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.732
Do you want to go back
to the way things were

06:38.732 --> 06:40.567
during the Leaderless Times?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.236
No leader to serve.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.405
Maybe I'll visit my kids.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.698
The Great Daughter!

06:46.698 --> 06:47.866
She's arrived!

06:47.866 --> 06:49.868
Never mind.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.579
Now, I have full faith
that Petey's big speech

06:52.579 --> 06:55.832
will provide divine clarity
about our town's future.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.294
Till then,
we all must remain calm.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.922
The Leader has forsaken us!

07:02.922 --> 07:05.759
Our existence is useless!

07:08.011 --> 07:09.220
<i>OK, title of the speech.</i>

07:09.220 --> 07:11.514
"A New New Utopia,"

07:11.514 --> 07:13.266
and underline
the first "new."

07:13.266 --> 07:15.060
Wait, did you think
I was writing that down?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.227
I'm working.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.189
You're so funny, bestie.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.774
Listen,
in my previous work life,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.193
I self-sabotaged
by getting hyper-focused

07:23.193 --> 07:25.278
on tiny things
to avoid a big thing.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.697
So can you maybe call me out
if I start doing that?

07:27.697 --> 07:30.241
Like, maybe we can have a
code word, like "beep boop"?

07:30.241 --> 07:32.577
Yeah, I'm less
of a "get involved" person

07:32.577 --> 07:34.120
and more of a "go with the flow

07:34.120 --> 07:35.330
and talk shit in the back"
person.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.207
Oh, that's actually perfect.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.542
It'll be like a bestie
brainstorm sesh.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.503
Does bestie mean something
different in New York?

07:41.503 --> 07:42.796
Like, is that a regional thing?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.923
You're literally
the funniest.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.134
So what's the first thing
you'd fix about New Utopia?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.594
Oh, maybe make
our movie theater

07:49.594 --> 07:51.513
un-censor all the films
about gutsy women

07:51.513 --> 07:53.306
challenging the status quo.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.601
<i>Coming this fall,
"Erin Brockovich,"</i>

07:56.601 --> 08:01.231
<i>the story of a secretary
who stayed a secretary.</i>

08:01.231 --> 08:02.649
Anyway,
that's just a small thought,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.526
not like the complex,
big-picture stuff

08:04.526 --> 08:07.070
you'll share with us
in your keynote speech tonight.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.405
What do you think
you'll open with?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.281
Like, economic overhaul
or unpacking

08:10.281 --> 08:12.158
our traditional concepts
of gender roles?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.953
That's good.
- Hmm, I love that question.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.373
Semi-related, want to see
the standing desk I ordered?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.166
Um, "beep boop."

08:20.166 --> 08:21.501
Uh, what?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.128
Oh, no, no, no.
That wasn't a "beep boop."

08:23.128 --> 08:25.046
A desk is where
the work happens.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.715
Standing desk delivery.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.299
Where do you want it?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.760
Wait, so you're also
the package delivery guy here?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.722
Unlike you,
I enjoy serving my community.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.724
Oh, didn't you hear?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.892
I already served
my community today

08:37.892 --> 08:40.520
by freeing everyone
from their horrible jobs.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.522
Speaking of which,
where's my oat milk latte?

08:44.357 --> 08:48.028
Why won't you milk?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.904
You can't just
paint over a cow pie

08:49.904 --> 08:51.698
and say mission accomplished.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.491
Ugh,
first you want me to leave,

08:53.491 --> 08:55.493
then you want me
to fix things around here.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.870
Is negging me your whole deal?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.496
Yes, it is.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.749
And I'm gonna keep negging
you till you leave.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.125
Bandit, chill.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.168
She needs to focus
on her speech,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.836
and your pecs are fully out.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.255
That's right,
so you can take your attitude,

09:07.255 --> 09:10.300
your pecs, and my standing desk
to the new Leadership Center.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.927
- Where?
- Where the Sex Hut used to be.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.554
You kicked out the wives?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.681
No, I liberated them.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.641
Now they're my gal pals.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.143
Hey, girly.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.979
We picked up all the new
office decor you asked for.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.773
Yas, bitch!

09:24.773 --> 09:26.608
Amaze!

09:26.608 --> 09:28.610
Let's go redecorate.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.445
Beep boop,
beep boop, beep boop.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.447
You're silly.
Come on, ladies.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.283
Slay, slay, slay!

09:35.283 --> 09:37.452
Wendy, do less.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.330
Silence.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.916
I know everyone feels lost,

09:42.916 --> 09:45.877
but Petey will share
her infinite wisdom tonight.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.254
What if her vision
for the future

09:48.254 --> 09:52.217
is that she doesn't need any
of us for anything ever again?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.510
That's impossible.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.388
But she fired everyone,
even you.

09:57.388 --> 10:01.059
The Leader needs me.
She needs all of us.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.852
We just need
to prove it to her.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.647
What can Petey
not live without?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.690
Elders, launch an investigation

10:07.690 --> 10:09.359
into Petey's likes
and dislikes.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.279
OK, speech writing time.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.532
I just need to get my desk
at the right height.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.951
Nope.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.786
No.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.663
No.
Oh, almost.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.082
This better be important.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.459
Uh, hey, yeah,
how's your speech coming along?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.877
Because I got
a bar full of elders

10:27.877 --> 10:29.671
who have a lot of questions.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.423
Ooh, business is booming.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.508
Girlboss!

10:33.508 --> 10:34.968
They're not buying anything.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.053
They're harassing me
for info about what you like,

10:37.053 --> 10:38.888
which they think
I know for some reason.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.431
Oh, probably
'cause I posted a pic

10:40.431 --> 10:41.599
with you with the caption,

10:41.599 --> 10:42.809
"This goddess
is my best friend,

10:42.809 --> 10:43.977
and she knows everything
about me."

10:43.977 --> 10:45.562
- Petey!
<i>- What?</i>

10:45.562 --> 10:47.272
<i>I only 'Gram what I love.</i>

10:47.272 --> 10:48.773
She 'Grams what she loves!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.859
Barkeep,
give us your pocket phone.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.402
- Get away from me.
- Gotta go.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.445
Mwah.
- Petey!

10:54.445 --> 10:56.030
You know,
for someone who hates

10:56.030 --> 10:59.200
so-called cult leaders so much,
you sure do pop up a lot.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.620
I was doing my animal
rescue volunteer rounds.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.290
Found this fellow warming
the feet of a trash can.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.500
- It's the only thing I know.
- Oh.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.127
Before you showed up,
he was about to enroll

11:09.127 --> 11:10.336
in culinary school.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.713
Now look what you did to him.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.215
What I did?
I freed him.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.300
I could be more cuddly.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.384
I can be very cuddly,

11:16.384 --> 11:17.844
as cuddly as you like,
I promise.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.889
I see you're very busy
working on a blank Word doc.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.473
Why don't you quit
while you're behind?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.767
I am not just gonna run
away from my problems.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.686
I'm going to do
a shopping montage.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.606
- What?
- Let's go, girls.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.649
Want me to sit on your feet?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.193
Yeah, OK.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.445
One at a time!

11:35.445 --> 11:37.447
We have examined
Petey's socials

11:37.447 --> 11:39.157
and discovered what she enjoys.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.243
All will be repurposed
to suit her likes.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.703
They include nail art,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.038
little gem lettuces,

11:45.038 --> 11:47.373
top 40 hits
from the early 2000s.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.960
Excuse me.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.879
is that a little gem lettuce
restaurant you're opening?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.088
Yes.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.215
Are you doing this
because of me?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.341
Yes.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.634
So my decision to free you

11:57.634 --> 11:59.427
allowed you
to pursue your passions?

11:59.427 --> 12:00.929
Yes.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.848
Oh, good things
are already manifesting.

12:03.848 --> 12:08.436
Now, if only someone's dream
was to open a nail art salon.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.813
Come, please.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.523
Please, please.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.816
No!

12:13.816 --> 12:16.986
We now need
fewer nail art stores

12:16.986 --> 12:19.447
and more purveyors of pants
that don't make

12:19.447 --> 12:21.491
Petey's butt look weird.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.869
Dun-dun-dun-da!

12:29.749 --> 12:32.126
I kind of want
a big soft pretzel.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.836
The leader kind
of wants a pretzel.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.129
Pretzels!

12:35.129 --> 12:36.714
Big, soft, warm--

12:36.714 --> 12:38.174
Pretzels!

12:38.174 --> 12:40.677
Even bigger, softer pretzels,
the softest ever,

12:40.677 --> 12:42.720
according to "Bon Appetit"!

12:47.767 --> 12:50.728
Oats, oats!

12:53.022 --> 12:54.565
Society has fallen apart!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.484
Every person for himself!

12:56.484 --> 12:58.653
And that moves there.
And that's over there.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.280
And then that is over there.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.323
And then--nope, over there.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.953
It's so funny,
I spent all day procrastinating

13:06.953 --> 13:09.080
and doubting myself
over this silly speech,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.541
but after connecting
with the people downtown,

13:11.541 --> 13:12.709
I had an epiphany.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.128
I already did fix New Utopia.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.921
No speech needed.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.342
What was that?

13:21.342 --> 13:22.969
- Help!
- There's no meaning!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.388
Someone tell me what to do!

13:25.388 --> 13:26.264
Beep boop.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.809
Despair is the only way out!

13:29.809 --> 13:31.102
I'm losing my mind!

13:31.102 --> 13:33.104
Remain calm!

13:33.104 --> 13:36.691
Insubordination will be met
with this T-shirt gun!

13:36.691 --> 13:38.276
Ahh!

13:38.276 --> 13:40.153
I can fix this.
I can fix this.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.905
Bring me my standing desk.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.291
Leave me.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.252
Wow, who could
have predicted this?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.421
Oh, wait, I did.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.923
- Petey, go do the speech.
- I don't have a speech.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.468
Why did I believe
I could seamlessly go

14:03.468 --> 14:08.306
from corporate wallflower
to full-on pope in 48 hours?

14:08.306 --> 14:11.267
Maybe I'm just not cut out
to be a leader.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.477
You're not.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.270
You're bad at this.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.564
Come on, let's get you
back to New York.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.608
What other choice do I have?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.443
Unless--

14:20.443 --> 14:23.154
I don't know--
someone wants to stop me?

14:23.154 --> 14:24.906
Like my bestie?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.325
Petey, you want to abandon us
the minute things get hard,

14:27.325 --> 14:28.951
just like Erin Brockovich
did at the end

14:28.951 --> 14:30.578
of that 20-minute movie
that I saw.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.246
That's right, I checked.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.415
You didn't even get
a full Erin Brockovich.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.875
It was the one thing I asked.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.126
Beep [bleep] boop.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.797
Wow, you're right, Eliza.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.299
That is just
the pep talk I needed.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.968
- What?
- Yeah, not a pep talk.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.806
Please welcome the bringer
of clarity and wisdom,

14:49.806 --> 14:52.100
the Leader.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.559
Hey!

14:53.559 --> 14:55.019
All right.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.229
Um...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.481
I heard New Utopians
like to party,

14:58.481 --> 15:02.318
but I didn't think
you'd would go this hard.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.657
So speech might have
been the wrong word.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.451
I wanted you all
to do what you wanted,

15:10.451 --> 15:12.328
and somehow,
that resulted in a lot

15:12.328 --> 15:14.664
of you losing your minds.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.208
TLDR, I messed up.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.459
It happens.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.546
I don't have all the answers.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.090
But the leader
must be all knowing!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.800
Our ideology is flawed!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.718
Life is a chaotic void!

15:27.718 --> 15:29.929
Or maybe she's
not a leader at all!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.598
Just a self-obsessed city girl
working out her daddy issues!

15:32.598 --> 15:34.308
No, no, no, no, no.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.310
I just--I didn't
know what I was doing

15:36.310 --> 15:37.770
when I became your leader!

15:37.770 --> 15:40.940
I'm on a confidence journey
because I'm insecure.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.484
I'm still learning.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.404
Everyone, stop!

15:49.198 --> 15:52.243
Great leader,
I am a human Shih Tzu.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.704
My father before me
was a human Shih Tzu.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.205
His father before him

15:56.205 --> 15:57.373
was a brain surgeon,

15:57.373 --> 15:58.457
but if he'd known

15:58.457 --> 15:59.542
about human Shih Tzus,

15:59.542 --> 16:00.793
he would have been one.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.462
My service to you
isn't just a job.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.590
No, no, no, no, no,
it's my passion,

16:05.590 --> 16:07.967
the greatest gift I have
to share with the world.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.010
Aw.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.219
And it earns me a seat

16:10.219 --> 16:11.554
on the rocket
to space paradise.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.638
Ignoring that.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.848
After I'm gone,

16:13.848 --> 16:15.349
people will forget what I said,

16:15.349 --> 16:16.976
they will forget what I did,

16:16.976 --> 16:21.230
but they will never forget
how warm I made their feet.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.483
Wow, that was
so beautifully put.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.735
He's right, Petey.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.070
You don't respect
our line of work either.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
We wives took pride
in the skills

16:30.072 --> 16:31.657
we honed for your father.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.202
I got so good
at listening to him describe

16:34.202 --> 16:36.078
the series-long arc of "Monk."

16:36.078 --> 16:39.832
And he never forced me to carry
around shopping bags all day.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.335
I didn't pay for six years
of wife grad school

16:42.335 --> 16:44.754
to suddenly be told
I'm a gal pal.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.422
Wow, OK.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.175
Yet another surprisingly
impactful speech.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.677
I believe it was
the poet Virgil who said,

16:51.677 --> 16:53.429
"Let's wrap this up."

16:53.429 --> 16:56.015
Petey, we understand the weight
that's been placed

16:56.015 --> 16:57.767
on your shoulders
as our leader.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.852
And that's why
the services we provide

16:59.852 --> 17:01.604
are so meaningful to us.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.232
They express our gratitude,
our dedication,

17:04.232 --> 17:06.400
and our love for you.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.364
We only wish you valued us
as much as we value you.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.241
Can't you understand that?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.575
Um, yes.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.118
Yes, I can.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.246
How is everybody here
so good at speeches?

17:18.246 --> 17:19.997
all: Speechblasters!

17:19.997 --> 17:21.499
Oh, right.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.334
Listen, I do want
to change this place.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.254
But in shying away from how
insane things are around here,

17:26.254 --> 17:27.713
I didn't take
into account how much

17:27.713 --> 17:29.257
you guys love worshiping me.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.050
And I see now that I was wrong.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.301
I learned my lesson.

17:34.929 --> 17:39.892
So I guess to fix
the problem I made,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.144
why don't we say temporarily--

17:42.144 --> 17:43.563
Ow!

17:43.563 --> 17:46.399
OK, everyone can keep
serving me as their job,

17:46.399 --> 17:48.109
and I'll stop trying
to stop you,

17:48.109 --> 17:49.694
effective immediately.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.488
I did it!

17:52.488 --> 17:53.906
I finally did it.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.494
An oat milk latte
for the Great Daughter!

17:58.494 --> 18:00.871
Oh, thanks, Emmett,
but it's 8:00 p. m.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.708
What?
You don't want it?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.419
You know, the Oxford Dictionary
defines "milk"

18:06.419 --> 18:08.546
as a white liquid produced by--

18:08.546 --> 18:09.797
Ugh, jeez!

18:09.797 --> 18:11.132
No more speeches!

18:11.132 --> 18:12.216
Fine!

18:15.886 --> 18:17.096
Mm.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.472
crowd: Hooray!

18:18.472 --> 18:19.849
Huzzah!

18:19.849 --> 18:21.058
Petey!

18:21.058 --> 18:23.978
crowd: Petey, Petey, Petey!

18:23.978 --> 18:25.688
I knew I would get it.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.442
Oh, wow.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.697
Back to humiliate me some more?

18:34.697 --> 18:37.783
No, I still think
you're a plague upon this town,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.244
but I respect a gal
who owns her mistakes.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.246
Never seen a cult leader
do that before.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.206
I can do a lot
of things you've never

18:44.206 --> 18:45.958
seen a cult leader do before.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.085
Oh, I bet you can.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.965
But I did count five "ums"
in your speech today.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.926
I really think you could
benefit from Speechblasters.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.225
Human Shih Tzu,
see you in the morning.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.518
I'll see you in the morning.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.021
Ha-ha!
She'll see me in the morning.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.444
We're closed.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.571
OK, I know
I screwed up today,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.657
not just with the town,
but with you.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.949
Yeah.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.785
I may be in a cult,
but I don't like

19:20.785 --> 19:22.161
following your every whim.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.788
Real besties are equals.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.582
I hear you,
which is why I thought

19:26.582 --> 19:28.626
we could do something
I know you like.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.670
Why don't I tell you
the parts you missed

19:30.670 --> 19:32.129
in "Erin Brockovich."

19:32.129 --> 19:33.631
Really?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.216
I'm listening.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.677
So there's something
in the water making kids sick.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.844
Mm-hmm.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.096
And who takes it
upon herself

19:40.096 --> 19:43.057
to strut around town
and make things better

19:43.057 --> 19:45.059
for everyone,
but Erin Brockovich.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.852
Yes, I knew it.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.187
- That's right.
- Oh.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.231
The curly haired babe
with a smart mouth

19:50.231 --> 19:51.232
<i>and a coughing baby.</i>

19:54.652 --> 19:57.405
Are you tired
of not being excellent?

19:57.405 --> 20:01.784
Would you like to unlock the
full power of the human mind?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.370
Have I got a solution for you--

20:04.370 --> 20:06.414
Speechblasters!

20:06.414 --> 20:08.874
For over 30-something years,

20:08.874 --> 20:12.044
Speechblasters has helped folks
just like you

20:12.044 --> 20:14.422
conquer the art of speeches,

20:14.422 --> 20:17.967
toasts, and general talkery.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.220
Just ask these several people.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.181
Before Speechblasters,
I was anxious, broke

20:24.181 --> 20:26.475
and on the run
from a dangerous relative.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.602
But now,
I don't say "um" anymore.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.521
These days,
when I call my family

20:30.521 --> 20:32.398
to insist they stop looking
for me,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.483
I sound more confident.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.402
Thanks, Speechblasters.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.320
My mom signed us up
for a workshop.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.865
But when we got here,
they took our shoes,

20:40.865 --> 20:43.534
then gave us lentils,
then a guy came out,

20:43.534 --> 20:45.244
and he started talking
about a comet,

20:45.244 --> 20:46.912
and now I'm engaged.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.081
It's been a weird few years.
