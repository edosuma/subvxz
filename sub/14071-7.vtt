10:19.702 --> 10:21.238
Trouble in paradise?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.575
Yeah, I don't know. Ijust need peace of mind.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.917
Okay, well, there is one nugget

10:29.379 --> 10:31.370
I can share without even lifting a finger.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.706
TRAVIS: I’m not sure this is a good idea.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.708
It's your chance
to show the world you got a brain.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.302
Yeah, well, can't we just get baked
and rent some Jet Skis or something?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.720
You want to stay at number 12?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.469
No, if I go 12, you and Jason do lose a client.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.394
Even more reason to do this.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.763
And you're not my client. Remember that.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.891
If anybody asks, you're not my client.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.815
JAY: Spence, Spence.
SPENCER: Glaze.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.439
-JAY: Right on time, buddy. I like it.
-My man.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.770
-How are you, bud?
-SPENCER: Good to see you.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.275
You, too. We'll catch up in a little bit.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.606
Hey, today's gonna be great, man.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.237
Kid's a little nervous. He's never done this.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.988
-Why? It's with me.
-Yeah, exactly.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.994
I'm a little surprised you called me about him.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.863
-Why, you're his guy.
-I'm not his guy.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.781
Whoa, whoa. Why you jumping all over me?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.663
You know how it is
when these players come out of college.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.084
-They're going through a lot of stress.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.586
I'm helping him with that transition.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.255
-Like a mentor.
-You're a really good person.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.212
Just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.793
-I like it.
-Till I get my registration.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.427
I got to keep a little safe distance.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.845
-Come on, you know the game.
-Yeah, I do.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.264
That's why you help him,
he helps me, I help you.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.182
We all win. One big happy Mafia.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.511
I got a plan to keep Ricky Jerret here in Miami.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.471
Does this plan involve
some rope and a chair?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.107
'Cause last thing I heard,
he had a $33 million offer from Buffalo.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.356
He's also the most impulsive man that I know.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.564
He starts dragging his feet about something,
it can only mean one thing.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.733
-He doesn't want to leave.
-Bingo.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.320
The lovable Charles Greane
already going dark.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.243
-Not sure what you mean.
-Using Ricky's weakness

11:49.334 --> 11:50.915
against him to further your own agenda.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.367
Mr. Machiavelli'd be proud.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.043
I'm just trying to be a good friend.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.916
-Right.
-I am.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.789
-Sure you are.
-Stop winking.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.049
Suppose we can get Ricky.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.637
How do we get past our cap issues?

12:01.763 --> 12:04.721
I crunched the numbers.
If we can getjust one player to restructure,

12:04.807 --> 12:06.217
we can get him for 10 a year.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.891
If you can get the restructure done,

12:09.145 --> 12:11.511
I'd bring Ricky back at nine a year for three.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.104
Not a nickel more.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.266
Yes, sir. Let's see what I can do.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.988
(CAR APPROACHING)

12:25.119 --> 12:26.825
(MUSIC BLARING)

12:35.838 --> 12:37.419
Pop, where you going?

12:37.507 --> 12:38.838
Back to Naples.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.918
See you got yourself a new toy.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.847
That ain't no toy.
That's a limited edition Spano GTA.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.009
Zero to 60 in 2.9 and a top speed of 230.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.018
Almost as fast as you once were.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.220
Oh.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.268
Rich man's way of cheering himself up.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.481
Well, this car's for you.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.232
-For me?
-She's yours.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.191
Boy, you can't buy forgiveness.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.697
Then I'm asking for it.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.491
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.114
(SCOFFS)

13:15.003 --> 13:16.664
All right, apology accepted.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.041
-Don't you want to know why?
-If it helps you.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.385
You were right.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.176
I was too much of a coward to make a choice.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.797
Feels like I've been getting passed
from team to team

13:28.891 --> 13:31.268
and I'm not sure
I want to go through all that anymore.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.646
Yeah, I get it, Ricky. I really do.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.975
But I can't stick around here
meddling in your livelihood,

13:40.069 --> 13:42.526
so, better I just get out your way.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.855
Take the car, Dad, and stick around.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.947
Let's take this town by storm,

13:47.327 --> 13:48.612
Jerret style.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.823
I need you, Dad. Show me how to do this.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.788
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

13:59.589 --> 14:00.795
(LINE RINGING)

14:01.591 --> 14:03.297
-JOE: (ON PHONE) Yeah?
-"Yeah"?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.624
That's the greeting I get now?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.209
Oh, I'm so sorry, Spencer.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.090
My goodness, that's so rude of me.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.218
Hello. How the fuck are you
this fine afternoon?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.093
Not very good.
Anderson had a meeting with Andre

14:14.270 --> 14:16.477
in our fucking office
and I saw it with my own two eyes.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.767
(SIGHS)

14:20.860 --> 14:23.146
(SIGHS) Well, that's fucking great news.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.902
-How come?
-I have no idea.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.396
You still play the stupid card, huh?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.699
God damn it, Joe,
I'm not playing a fucking game.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.115
Okay? Anderson wants to have dinner with us
tonight at Komodo and I need you there.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.574
Great, well, then, how about this?

14:34.665 --> 14:36.872
Urn, have your people call my people, okay?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.624
We have the same fucking people.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.126
Then that works out great.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.046
All right, bye-bye. Love you, little buddy.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.672
Kisses and hugs.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.213
Fuck you.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.878
Sorry.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.054
ANNOUNCER: (ON TV)
Harris on a designed run.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.132
Travis Mack takes him down in the backﬁeld.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.766
JAY: Travis Mack!
TRAVIS: Yo.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.639
Tell me what you got going over here, buddy.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.933
Florida State versus Miami. It's our rivalry.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.690
JAY: Big time offense, bigger time defense
if you do yourjob right.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.480
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
It's the kind of game you live for, man.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.603
JAY: Man, you better live for it
if you want to play in the NFL.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.528
All right, tell me
what your big assignment, though, is here.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.320
TRAVIS: As soon as Jacori took off,
man, it was game over.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.778
-Like that, loss of six, baby.
-(CHUCKLES) I like that.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.487
All right, another play right here.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.455
Tell me what you're telling Kevin Hunter.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.159
I was calling disco, discounting the play.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.414
Telling Kevin we're going off reservation.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.587
Really? Man, you went outlawjust like that?

15:24.674 --> 15:25.663
-Oh, yeah.
-Wow.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.089
Coach Fisher really must have faith in you.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.508
Yeah. Yeah, he really did. And this is why.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.338
Blooshl
(LAUGHS)

15:33.558 --> 15:34.843
JAY: I like the sound effects, buddy.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.641
Mack truck with a Bugatti engine, man.
A nose for the football.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.764
But you and I both know
it's less about the body,

15:39.856 --> 15:41.596
more about what's between the ears
whether or not

15:41.691 --> 15:43.101
you're gonna lead a defense in the NFL.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.183
So, we're gonna shift gears here,
you and I, buddy.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.652
Okay, Iet'sjust say
you got drafted by the Jets.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.354
Yeah, well, Jets are gonna
have to trade up to get me.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.906
Slow your roll there, Mack.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.735
Okay, Coach Belichick,
you know he loves to disguise things

15:54.829 --> 15:57.036
and mess with people, right?
So we're gonna start here.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.784
Gronk is gonna start in the backfield.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.537
He loves to get you to think a guy
is playing running back when he's not.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.004
These guys are in man coverage over here
and we're gonna take Gronk.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.870
He's gonna motion him out over here.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.047
Line him up over here.
Now also you got trips in the backside.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.499
So, I want you to come up here
and draw for me

16:09.594 --> 16:11.050
exactly what you're gonna tell your backers

16:11.304 --> 16:12.885
and how you're gonna adjust your secondary.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.629
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:15.725 --> 16:16.805
Travis, not a two-hour show.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.973
-Let's go, buddy.
-I know, I got it.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.436
-Come on, man.
-I got it. I got it.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.011
-Uh...
-We're on Coughlin time.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.852
-JAY: You good?
-I'm great. I got it.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.444
You don't think I know
where the linebackers go?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.532
Playing the game for 12 fucking years.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.407
-Travis.
-| just need a second.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.949
-Do you want some water?
-I'm not thirsty.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.125
You want to take a walk around the block?

16:49.217 --> 16:51.128
Holy shit, can I get a second?

16:52.303 --> 16:53.543
A little dramatic.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.758
-Is there anything I can do?
-Can you cure dyslexia?

17:02.271 --> 17:03.807
-You're dyslexic?
-Jeez, louder, Spence.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.514
I don't think the sound guy from inside
could quite pick that up, man.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.850
Why wouldn't you just tell me
before we agreed to do this, huh?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.936
We didn't agree to do this, you did.

17:11.614 --> 17:15.106
Listen, it's not that bad.
Everything just takes extra time.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.408
It takes repetition, muscle memory, a routine.

17:17.495 --> 17:18.530
Put a whiteboard in front of me

17:18.621 --> 17:20.612
and everything starts looking
like quantum fucking physics.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.283
And this is why you skipped the combine.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.335
You know, Ijust started worrying
about all the shit people were gonna say

17:31.425 --> 17:32.926
when they find out I botched the Wonderlic.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.092
It's the same shit I've been hearing
my whole entire life, really.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.591
That I'm stupid, that I'm dumb,
some big, dumb football player.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.298
Man, fuck that Wonderlic.
Do you know how smart you got to be

17:40.393 --> 17:42.258
to run a defense the way Travis Mack runs it?

17:42.353 --> 17:44.765
You got to be fucking brilliant. Brilliant.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.144
I'm gonna go back in there.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.938
I'm gonna tell Glazer
we're gonna postpone this whole thing.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.641
We'll do it another time.
Before we go back in that studio, though,

17:50.736 --> 17:53.022
I'll make sure that you're properly prepped,
then we're gonna nail it.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.813
For the rest of the day today,
we're gonna go rent two Jet Skis

17:55.908 --> 17:57.569
and we're gonna go get high
as a motherfucker

17:57.660 --> 17:59.571
because I roll a bomb-ass joint.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.493
No.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.499
No, I'm gonna do this.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.836
Just wigged out.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.090
Hey, hey, hey.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.012
-Dude, you all right?
-It's all good, man.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.052
It's all good.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.634
JAY: Man, what happened?
What are you doing?

18:25.771 --> 18:28.023
Fuck the board, man.
Kings personnel, tight gun.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.938
I'm gonna run a zone coverage
of the backers pressed.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.766
Gronk motions across,
I'm gonna call a ringo,

18:31.861 --> 18:33.647
drop my corner to send my will
on the backside

18:33.738 --> 18:36.024
and Brady better pray to God
he gets the ball off by the fifth step

18:36.157 --> 18:37.943
or else that's lights the fuck out.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.356
JAY: Wow.

18:39.702 --> 18:40.691
Just like that, huh?

18:40.786 --> 18:41.901
And Gisele's feeding him breakfast in bed

18:41.996 --> 18:43.532
every Sunday for the rest of the season.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.740
That is the Travis Mack teams want to see.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.335
-Okay, let's get you going again.
-TRAVIS: Let's do it.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.375
JAY: Let's leave Gisele out of it.
Probably not a good idea.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.414
So, Mr. Velasquez.

18:55.009 --> 18:55.998
SI'.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.218
All right, what can I do for you?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.512
You got a patient named Mr. Chavez?

19:01.599 --> 19:02.805
Yeah, I'm not at liberty to say.

19:02.892 --> 19:03.881
Oh.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.016
What a surprise.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.514
How about now?

19:07.605 --> 19:09.971
It's against my oath
to take bribes or share information...

19:10.066 --> 19:11.476
Right, right, right. How about now?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.307
-Yeah, I know him.
-What's he look like?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.654
(CHUCKLES)

19:15.738 --> 19:18.650
Mr. Velasquez,
you must not think very much of me.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.732
I'm neither here nor there, really.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.907
Well, he's about, uh, 6'5", 260,

19:26.374 --> 19:27.580
and bald.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.908
But not like you. He fully embraces it.

19:31.796 --> 19:35.459
-Uh, so what did you give him?
-I prescribed Vicodin to him.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.550
He's got headaches and dizzy spells
and chronic pain.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.549
-Don't we all, right?
-No, no, not like Mr. Chavez does.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.339
How much did you prescribe him?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.595
Will there be anything else
I can do for you, Mr. Velasquez?

19:47.770 --> 19:50.637
Yeah, um, you got any Adderall?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.688
And you know what? While we're here,

19:53.776 --> 19:56.483
try out some of that Propecia
the kids are talking about.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.198
Saw you cut Kovac
in front of a bunch of five-year-olds.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.324
That's some grim reaper shit.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.401
(LAUGHS)

20:05.496 --> 20:06.485
Boo.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.622
I'd be spooked
if I hadn'tjust inked a new deal.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.074
Hey, that's a good deal for you.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.076
-A lot of money.
-Yeah, man.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.872
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir. (CHUCKLES)

20:19.927 --> 20:21.792
The team would like you to consider
a restructure.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.388
Damn, Charles.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.007
I didn't even get the money yet, man,
and they already asking me to return it?

20:27.101 --> 20:29.183
Why don't you go to Suh
and them big money cats?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.139
-'Cause I want you to do it.
-Well, I ain't doing it.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.516
My money belong to me, man.
I just bought this fucking house.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.230
Okay, all right, I understand.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.520
And I'm sure Coach Berg will understand.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.148
Either that
or he'll run your ass ragged in camp.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.233
-Wow.
-Supposed to be filthy hot this summer.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.700
Wow, you gonna blackmail me with exercise?

20:43.784 --> 20:46.992
No, I'mjust saying
try being a team guy for a change.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.196
Show the world that it ain't
always all about Alonzo.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.327
-Look, Chuck, I don't mind moving the dough
-Mmm-hmm.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.161
as long as I know it's all still coming to me.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.664
-I got a mortgage to pay.
-And you're gonna get every single penny.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.169
-Every dollar?
-Every dollar.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.714
-That's my word.
-All right, then.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.424
Igotyou.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.760
So who the move for?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.142
-Uh...
-Jerret?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.516
Fuck that. Motherfuck that.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.434
And why the hell would I buy myself
out of a job?

21:16.525 --> 21:18.061
Because if you're the team's only deep threat,

21:18.194 --> 21:19.775
you're gonna see double coverage
the entire season.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.443
Double coverage
ain't got shit on Alonzo Cooley.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.397
This is true.
I agree, but you two work better as a pair.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.279
Look at Antonio Brown
and Martavis Bryant up in Pittsburg.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.324
-That's one.
-Hey,

21:28.412 --> 21:29.868
they had career years together, though.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.412
-And what about AB. and Wallace?
-It's the same guy.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.240
But what has Wallace done
since he left Pittsburgh?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.407
So you're saying that could be me and Rick?

21:35.503 --> 21:36.538
Yes!

21:36.670 --> 21:40.003
This is great for you and good for the team.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.041
Just make sure
I get Ricky front row parking spot.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.167
(INHALES)

21:45.262 --> 21:46.672
Just make sure
I get Ricky front row parking spot.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.254
Okay, I'm gonna do that for you.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.716
-Damn, thank you.
-No, thank you from me.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.309
And I'm Antonio, he's Martavis.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.098
-I'm Antonio, he's Martavis.
-Yes.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.065
Thank you, Antonio.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.225
Yeah.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.815
(YOU'RE THE ONE PLAYING)

22:07.201 --> 22:08.816
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.034
Just heard Andre's making a bid
for our company.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.320
Fuck. You sure about that?

22:13.457 --> 22:15.664
Yeah, Virginia said lawyers are on the clock.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.662
Drawing up the contracts right now.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.793
Well, that doesn't make sense.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.499
Travis did great on Glazer's show.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.842
He goes top five, others will follow.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.170
We'll double our roster.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.302
Anderson's not a fucking idiot.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.261
Why would he sell us right now, huh?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.299
Well, he probably already knows
what Andre knows.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.020
Look, I know, too. It's okay.

22:41.819 --> 22:42.979
You know what?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.276
I know that you're in a lot of pain.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.066
What the fuck are you talking about, Joe?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.109
The pill-mill, Dr. Frey.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.316
Wow.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.573
Okay, that was a one-time deal.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.197
Oh, that's denial.
The first sign of addiction, man.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.835
-Believe me, I've been there.
-My prescription ran out.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.289
Oh. Look, it's fine. It's all good.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.666
We play up the addiction angle,
send you to rehab.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.293
Hey, I don't fucking need rehab.

23:05.426 --> 23:06.882
Believe me, rehab's not that bad.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.177
And plus, it makes it impossible for people
to turn their back on you.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.552
It did wonders for Robert Downey Jr.
He's fucking Iron Man.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.849
What Andre knows about me

23:15.936 --> 23:18.427
has nothing to do
with me taking fucking pills.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.888
Oh.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.144
Okay, there's more? Wow.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.768
I can't wait to hear this.
Let me guess, you're a human trafficker.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.356
I lost a lot of money in a very bad deal, okay?

23:30.451 --> 23:31.861
Back when Andre was managing it.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.234
I tried to keep it under wraps,

23:33.370 --> 23:36.203
but he's been fucking lording it over me
ever since we stole Sizzle.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.407
Okay, so you lost some money.
So what? It happens to everybody.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.787
Joe, it was $6 million.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.123
Oh.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.833
In one shot?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.464
What the fuck, man?

23:51.555 --> 23:54.217
Look, I was ready to retire,
okay, but my savings were shit.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.173
But I wanted to live that lifestyle.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.926
I did everything I could, scrambled
to keep it all together,

23:59.063 --> 24:01.520
but then I said fuck it.
I rolled the dice. Iwent all in.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.939
You said when you took the job

24:04.026 --> 24:06.517
that you were doing it to protect players,
not because you were broke.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.354
I did take this job to protect players, Joe.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.240
And it's because lwas fucking broke.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.988
-You could have told me that.
-You wouldn't have hired me.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.444
You're probably fucking right.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.501
I also bought in some other guys on the deal.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.786
(SIGHS)

24:26.882 --> 24:27.962
They got hurt, too.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.666
You couldn'tjust be a fucking pill fiend, huh?

24:33.555 --> 24:34.715
No.

Ranch. Or blue cheese if you like.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.567
I'm gonna enjoy watching you eat every bite.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.493
It don't mix with my diet.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.362
I got something else you
might like even better.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.250
I met up with Siefert earlier today.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.579
You tell him to kiss my ass? (CHUCKLES)

25:05.421 --> 25:06.752
Not exactly.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.378
I told him we need your ass.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.415
And after moving a couple pieces around,

25:11.719 --> 25:12.925
I got you an offer.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.092
Really? How much we talking?

25:14.179 --> 25:17.421
I wasn't able to match
Buffalo's 11 million per year,

25:18.434 --> 25:20.891
but I was able to get you nine million a year
for three years.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.843
Damn, Chuck. How you swing that?

25:23.814 --> 25:26.021
-I got a knack for this kind of stuff.
-No shit.

25:26.150 --> 25:29.517
SO, what you think? Are you willing
to take less money to stay home in Miami?

25:31.947 --> 25:33.483
It ain't about the money.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.197
Miami is where I belong.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.029
Yeah? So the Ricky Jerret legacy lives on?

some of them wings in celebration.

We're aware that Andre's
been making a bid for the company.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.735
And I'm sure that he's been saying
a few choice things about me.

So, Ijust want to come clean
and let you hear my side of the story first.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.619
Your value to me, to my company now

is zero, absolute zero.
