While I was tryin' to keep
Annie's hands off me,

decided to steal herself a new

Me and Annie got
to talking, 'cause, well,
we had no other choice.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.765
And it turned out she-- that's
what she said to call him--
was easy to talk to.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.632
I didn't really
commit the crime,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.836

to be here because of karma.

it sounds confusing.

me confusing my whole life,
but I'm not.

with this whole surgery.

to justify it.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.991
[ Narrating ] Billie wouldn't
accept any of Frank's phone
calls or answer his letters,

13:44.057 --> 13:47.360
so I knew it was gonna take
somethin' big to get her back,

13:50.430 --> 13:53.533
somethin' that would
make Billie feel like
her and Frank were even.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.303
Since Billie was mad
at Frank for showin' me
her naked picture,

13:56.369 --> 13:59.339
we decided to show Frank
to the whole world.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.480
Joy decided the problem
with her picture was gonna
need a big solution too,

14:07.547 --> 14:10.317
so she got out
her poison cookie recipe...

graduated community college--

went downhill from there.

leading a life of crime,

given Billie a rush,

to Frank that as much as he
wanted Billie back in his life,

18:35.348 --> 18:38.084
not havin' him in hers
was what she needed.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.387

really loved her,
