commit the crime,

13:40.153 --> 13:43.991
[ Narrating ] Billie wouldn't
accept any of Frank's phone
calls or answer his letters,

13:44.057 --> 13:47.360
so I knew it was gonna take
somethin' big to get her back,

13:50.430 --> 13:53.533
somethin' that would
make Billie feel like
her and Frank were even.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.303
Since Billie was mad
at Frank for showin' me
her naked picture,

13:56.369 --> 13:59.339
we decided to show Frank
to the whole world.

Joy decided the problem
with her picture was gonna
need a big solution too,

to Frank that as much as he
wanted Billie back in his life,

18:35.348 --> 18:38.084
not havin' him in hers
was what she needed.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.387

really loved her,
