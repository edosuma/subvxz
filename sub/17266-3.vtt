00:08.734 --> 00:10.367
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN ALL OF IT, OKAY?

- WHY, MAGGIE, WHY DO YOU
TAKE PLEASURE IN MY PAIN?

00:13.233 --> 00:15.600

00:15.633 --> 00:18.000
FACING YOUR FEARS,
GROWING UP.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.767
WATCHING A MAN CHEW ANOTHER

- OH, THAT'S JUST BRUCE.
HE'S GRABBING HIS STICKS.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.433
- HE'S JUST GRABBING
HIS STICKS?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.033

WITH SCOOTER AND THE BOYS,
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYWHERE

00:37.066 --> 00:39.467
AT SCOOTER'S TO KEEP IT, SO
I SAID HE COULD LEAVE IT HERE.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.300
- MAGGIE, HE CHEATED ON YOU.
HE SHOULD NOT BE STORING

00:41.333 --> 00:42.533
HIS SPORTS EQUIPMENT IN HERE.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.367

05:01.266 --> 05:03.266
WE HAD TO CALL THE WHOLE AREA
OUR COOKIE.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.266
- OUR MOM MADE US CALL IT
OUR ANUS.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.367

- WHY? THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.533

YOU'RE SO UPSET.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.600
ALL YOU'VE EVER WANTED
IS TO NOT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

05:15.633 --> 05:17.300
WITH YOUR MOM.
- NO. I DON'T WANT

05:17.333 --> 05:19.166
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER, BUT I
WANT HER TO WANT ONE WITH ME.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.333
- YOU GUYS ARE TOO SIMILAR,

05:20.367 --> 05:21.467
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU DON'T GET ALONG.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.200
- RUDE! SHE IS HYPER-CRITICAL
AND JUDGEY.

05:24.233 --> 05:27.200
- AND YOU FIRED YOUR ASSISTANT
BECAUSE HE HAD TINY TEETH.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.400
- YEAH! TINY TEETH
ARE A DEAL BREAKER.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.400

REFUSE TO WOUND

05:31.433 --> 05:34.700

HIDDEN IN EACH BLOOM."

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.333

- I WISH.

FROM HIS DELICATE AND
HEART-WRENCHING POEM JASMINE.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.066
- MM.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.033
ZACH'S LEADING A POETRY GROUP.

05:46.033 --> 05:47.567
- SO YOU TEACH POETRY NOW?
- TEACH

05:47.600 --> 05:49.367
IS AN AGGRESSIVE WORD.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.700
WHAT I DO IS I ASSEMBLE
A COLLECTIVE OF LOCAL WORDSMITHS

05:52.734 --> 05:55.667
THE THEME OF OUR READING THIS
WEEK IS "UNFINISHED BUSINESS."

05:55.700 --> 05:57.033
YOU SHOULD COME.

- I PROBABLY WON'T.
- WELL, YOU SHOULD,

05:58.600 --> 06:00.767
BECAUSE IT'S A SAFE
AND NURTURING ENVIRONMENT

06:01.000 --> 06:02.166
TO WORK THROUGH YOUR ISSUES.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.367
YOUR MOM IS MY BEST STUDENT.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.300
- WAIT! MY MOM
IS IN THIS POETRY CLASS?

06:06.333 --> 06:10.066
- SHE'S BEEN DOING SOME VERY
DEEP, EMOTIONAL EXCAVATION.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.233
VERY, VERY COLD
ARE HER WORDS ABOUT YOU.

06:12.266 --> 06:14.266
- OKAY, WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.767
HER NAME ISN'T ON
THIS FLYER, SO...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.100
- OH, THAT'S BECAUSE SHE WRITES
UNDER A NOM DE PLUME--

06:18.133 --> 06:19.100
PHYLICIA RASHAD.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.600

06:20.600 --> 06:22.500
THAT'S THE MOM
FROM THE COSBY SHOW.

06:22.533 --> 06:24.333
- PERHAPS.
OR MAYBE...

06:24.333 --> 06:25.734
THE MOM
FROM THE COSBY SHOW

06:25.767 --> 06:27.200
WAS NAMED AFTER YOUR MOTHER.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.200
- NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.633
- OR IS IT?
- YEAH. NO, IT IS.

06:29.667 --> 06:30.734
- I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

06:30.767 --> 06:32.200
WITH A KID NAMED
ANDY MCDOWELL--

06:32.233 --> 06:33.667
- I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED.
- AND HE WAS BORN

06:33.700 --> 06:35.333
ON GROUNDHOG DAY,
SO ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.500
- O...KAY!

06:36.533 --> 06:38.266
[fingers snapping]
- THANK YOU, MR. NANJIANI.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.367
THAT WASN'T TECHNICALLY A POEM.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.133
THAT WAS ANOTHER GHOST STORY.
BUT...

06:43.166 --> 06:44.600
CHARACTERS WELCOME.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.066
I WANNA THANK EVERYONE

- SANGAR, YOUR DESCRIPTION
OF THAT RAILROAD HOBO--

08:21.233 --> 08:22.700
HAUNTING.
- BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.333
IT'S ALL TRUE.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.567
- EXCUSE ME, PHYLICIA?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.367
SNAPS.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.300
FOR YOUR HONESTY
AND FOR YOUR BRAVERY.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.567
- YOU MADE MY DAY.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.166
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME,

08:36.166 --> 08:37.266
YOU COULD JUST TALK TO ME.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.633
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE
A POEM ABOUT IT.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.066
- THAT POEM WASN'T ABOUT YOU.
- REALLY?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.734
"THE CHINESE DUMPLING
THAT LEFT THE BOWL"?

08:42.767 --> 08:43.767
I'M THE DUMPLING.

BUT...
IT WASN'T ABOUT YOU.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.033
- WELL, IT WAS VERY HURTFUL.

08:49.066 --> 08:50.500
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.633
I NEVER INTENDED
FOR YOU TO HEAR IT!

08:52.667 --> 08:54.467
THIS IS MY JOURNEY.
- OKAY. WELL...

08:54.500 --> 08:57.300
JUST SO YOU KNOW, PHYLICIA
RASHAD IS A REAL PERSON.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.133
- WHAT?
- SHE'S THE VERY ATTRACTIVE

08:59.166 --> 09:01.066
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MOTHER
ON THE COSBY SHOW.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.600
- WELL, DOES SHE SPELL HER NAME
WITH AN "F" OR A "PH"?

09:03.633 --> 09:05.066
- "PH."
- GODDAMN IT!

09:05.100 --> 09:07.233
THAT'S HOW I SPELL IT !

09:07.266 --> 09:09.467
- NO, BUT I REALLY NAILED HER
WITH THAT PHYLICIA RASHAD STUFF.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.600
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER FACE.
- YEAH. SHE DIDN'T KNOW

09:11.600 --> 09:14.066
SHE WAS DOING THAT?
- NO. APPARENTLY NOT.

09:14.066 --> 09:15.600
BUT THAT'S MY MOTHER FOR YOU,
SO--AAH!

09:15.633 --> 09:17.500
- WHAT IS IT?
[overlapping shouting]

09:17.533 --> 09:19.734
- I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN A WELL!

09:19.734 --> 09:21.533
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WELL!

09:21.567 --> 09:23.467
- HEY, HEY, IT'S JUST--
- WITH MY DOG.

09:23.467 --> 09:25.266
I DON'T WANNA DO IT.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.000
- IT'S JUST BRUCE'S DUMMY,
OKAY?

09:27.033 --> 09:29.000
WAIT. WHY IS ALL HIS STUFF
STILL HERE?

09:29.033 --> 09:30.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS CLASSIC.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.567
YOU SET BOUNDARIES,
AND HE IGNORES THEM.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.066
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FRANKLY, I'M SICK OF IT.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.233
- OKAY, THIS--I'M STARTING
TO GET REALLY WORRIED.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.367
I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY, BUT
HE'S NEVER NOT CALLED ME BACK.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.500
- OH, NO, I WOULDN'T WORRY.
HE AND HIS COUSIN TONY JOES

09:42.500 --> 09:43.734
PROBABLY
FELL THROUGH THE ICE.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.367
- I WOULD HONESTLY
CALL THE COPS

09:45.367 --> 09:47.500
IF HE HADN'T BEEN HERE TO PICK
UP HIS CHEESE-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.233
- COME AGAIN?
- WELL, WHEN WE CAME IN,

09:49.233 --> 09:50.300
I SAW HIS CHEESE-OF-THE-MONTH
CLUB BASKET--

09:50.333 --> 09:51.700
IT'S GONE FROM THE PORCH.

09:51.734 --> 09:54.367
HE OBVIOUSLY CAME TO GET IT.
- WHAT--WHAT'S THAT INVOLVE?

09:54.367 --> 09:55.500
THE CHEESE OF THE MONTH?

09:55.500 --> 09:56.734
- I GOT IT FOR HIM
FOR CHRISTMAS.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.433
HE LOVES IT.
HE NEVER MISSES A DELIVERY.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.000
- WOULD THAT, PERHAPS, INCLUDE

10:00.033 --> 10:01.633
LIKE FOUR WHEELS
OF SPANISH MANCHEGO

10:01.667 --> 10:04.500
AND LIKE A...
LIKE A REALLY LITTLE BABY

10:04.533 --> 10:06.100
THING OF CHUTNEY?

10:06.133 --> 10:07.367
- DID YOU EAT THE CHEESES?

10:07.367 --> 10:09.500
- [whispers]
UM...

10:09.533 --> 10:11.033
- I NEED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.

10:11.066 --> 10:13.433
- [whispering]
I DON'T WANT TO.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.233
I ATE THEM.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.767
- EMMA, THAT WAS 4 POUNDS
OF ARTISANAL CHEESES.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.500
- YEAH.
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.633
- IS IT IMPOSSIBLE?
THE FRENCH DO IT.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.333
- OKAY, SO IF...
YOU ATE HIS CHEESES,

10:24.367 --> 10:27.433
THEN BRUCE HASN'T BEEN HERE.

10:27.467 --> 10:30.333
EMMA, I THINK BRUCE
MIGHT BE MISSING.

10:30.367 --> 10:32.300
- OKAY. JUST TO CLARIFY,
ARE WE MORE WORRIED

10:32.333 --> 10:33.333
THAT BRUCE IS MISSING

10:33.367 --> 10:35.667
OR THAT I ATE 4 POUNDS
OF CHEESE?

10:35.667 --> 10:37.700
'CAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE
A CRY FOR HELP.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.400
- I'M GONNA CALL SOMEBODY.
- LIKE ON A REAL TIP.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.734
- LIKE 36 HOURS AGO.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.000
HE CAME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT
TO PICK UP HIS HOCKEY STICKS.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.233
- COME ON, THE DUDE'S STILL GOT
HIS HOCKEY STICKS HERE?

10:51.266 --> 10:52.734
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
HEY.

10:52.767 --> 10:55.066
CAUTION TAPE?
SERIOUSLY?

10:55.100 --> 10:57.033
- THIS IS THE SCENE OF A CRIME.
WE GOTTA DUST FOR PRINTS.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.533
- DUST FOR PRINTS?
IT'S BRUCE'S STUFF.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.000
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE TOUCHED IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.300
AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT
OR SOMETHING.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.166
- OKAY, YOU HAVE WATCHED
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS

11:03.200 --> 11:05.066
WAY TOO MANY TIMES.
AND FYI...

11:05.100 --> 11:07.200
YOU TWO NEED MORE GOING ON
IN YOUR LIVES.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.166
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S WALKING
AROUND THIS HOUSE

11:09.200 --> 11:10.767
IN FULL PAJAMAS
AT 11:30 A.M.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.600
- I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I WAS UP ALL NIGHT

11:12.633 --> 11:14.400
JOURNALING ABOUT
THE COMPLEX FEELINGS

11:14.433 --> 11:16.000
I'M HAVING ABOUT MY MOTHER,

11:16.033 --> 11:18.000
AND I CAME TO SOME STARTLING
CONCLUSIONS,

11:18.033 --> 11:19.467
WHICH I WOULD LOVE
TO SHARE WITH YOU TWO.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.233
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
- IF YOU GUYS ARE GAME--

11:21.266 --> 11:23.433
- WE CAN'T--MAGS AND I
HAVE TO GO TALK TO PEOPLE.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.567
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,

11:24.567 --> 11:25.700
I WANNA COME, GUYS.

11:25.734 --> 11:27.433
DO YOU GUYS WANT ME
TO COME MAYBE?

11:27.433 --> 11:29.400
- WE DO NOT.
- I'LL PUT ON PANTS.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.700
I'LL PUT ON REAL PANTS THAT HAVE
ZIPPERS AND A BUTTON.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.467
COULD YOU GUYS GET ME SOME
KRAFT SINGLES, THOUGH,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.000
WHILE YOU'RE OUT?
[groans] OHH...

11:37.700 --> 11:39.533
- HEY, MAGGIE.

11:39.567 --> 11:40.700
HEY, OFFICER MARK.
- HEY.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.233
- WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU TWO?

11:42.266 --> 11:44.166
- OH, NOT TOO MUCH.
WE JUST HAD TO ASK YOU

11:44.166 --> 11:46.200
A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT
BRUCE CARUSO'S WHEREABOUTS.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.066
- OH. WELL, I DON'T
REALLY GOT TIME FOR IT.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.200
THE UNION GUYS ARE COMING IN,

11:49.233 --> 11:50.600
AND THEY NEED THEIR
PATTY MELTS.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
- ALL RIGHT, SHE'S NOT
JUST GONNA GIVE IT TO US.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.734
WE GOTTA BREAK HER DOWN
SO SHE'LL GIVE US THE INFO.

11:54.734 --> 11:57.400
- NO. ACTUALLY DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.667
- DID YOU ALWAYS WANNA BE
A...WAITRESS, CANDY?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.033
- OH, GOD NO.
I WANTED TO BE A LOUNGE SINGER.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.567
- HMM.
- MY MOM SAID THAT I HAD

12:04.600 --> 12:06.467
THE PIPES FOR IT, BUT--
- OH.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.667
THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.767
MOST PARENTS DON'T SUPPORT
THEIR CHILDREN'S CHOICES

12:11.000 --> 12:12.467
TO GO INTO
THE PERFORMING ARTS.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.467
- WELL, SHE REALLY LIKED
MUSIC--COUNTRY MUSIC.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.333
SHE LOVED DOLLY PARTON.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.233
- OH, DID SHE LIKE BLONDES
WITH BIG BOOBS?

12:18.266 --> 12:20.033
- OKAY, WHAT ARE WE--
- 'CAUSE THAT'S THE OPPOSITE

12:20.066 --> 12:21.367
OF YOU.
- WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.734
- I GOT THE BOOBS.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.367
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NOT REAL,
ARE THEY, CANDY?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.233
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION, CANDY.

12:26.266 --> 12:27.633
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
JUST PARADING YOUR BOOBS AROUND

12:27.633 --> 12:29.100
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE?
- MAGGIE!

12:29.133 --> 12:30.667
- JUST TRYING TO CURRY THE FAVOR

12:30.700 --> 12:32.300
THAT YOUR MOTHER
NEVER GAVE YOU, HUH?

12:32.333 --> 12:34.133
- MAGGIE!
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

12:34.166 --> 12:36.667
- ALL RIGHT! FINE!
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

12:36.700 --> 12:38.100
I'LL TELL YA.
BRUCE CAME IN,

12:38.100 --> 12:39.467
AND HE WAS DRINKING COKE FLOAT
AFTER COKE FLOAT.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.367
I RAN OUT OF ICE CREAM,
SO I WENT IN THE BACK,

12:41.367 --> 12:43.500
AND I LET TYLER MOTORBOAT ME
IN THE WALK-IN CLOSET.

12:43.533 --> 12:44.700
- ALL RIGHT.
- TERRIF.

12:44.734 --> 12:47.133
- OKAY? BY THE TIME I CAME OUT,
BRUCE WAS GONE.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.233
HE WAS WITH SOME WEIRD GUY
WITH DREADS.

12:49.266 --> 12:51.600
- THAT'S HIS FRIEND SCOOTER.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

12:51.633 --> 12:54.233
- OH, MY GOD, I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT THAT JUST WORKED.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
- CANDY.

12:57.433 --> 12:59.667
THEY'RE HAVING AUDITIONS
THIS WEEKEND FOR HAIRSPRAY

12:59.700 --> 13:01.767
AT THE JCC. I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO OUT FOR IT.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.500
- YOU THINK I GOT
WHAT IT TAKES?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.133
- I KNOW YOU DO,
SWEETHEART.

13:05.166 --> 13:06.533
- COME ON, LET'S GO, MAG.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.266

LET'S GATHER OUR QUILLS.

13:13.066 --> 13:16.000
OKAY, SO DOES EVERYONE
FEEL THAT THEIR BUSINESS

13:16.000 --> 13:17.667
WAS FINISHED LAST NIGHT?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.400
- OH.

13:19.433 --> 13:22.633
AFTER I READ MY POEM
ABOUT BERNARD'S DING DONG,

13:22.667 --> 13:25.000
I GOT ASKED OUT ON A DATE.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.567
- WHY, YOU LITTLE JEZEBEL!

13:26.600 --> 13:28.734

PHYLICIA.
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,

13:34.333 --> 13:37.367
BUT I'VE BEEN APPROACHED
BY THE OWNER OF THE HUNAN PALACE

13:37.400 --> 13:40.400
ABOUT PRINTING MY POEM ON
THE BACK OF THE TAKE-OUT MENUS,

13:40.400 --> 13:41.500
SO FINGERS CROSSED.

13:41.533 --> 13:42.734
OH, JESUS CHRIST.

13:42.767 --> 13:45.166
- IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:45.200 --> 13:48.100
- OH, I JUST--I HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF MY OWN

13:48.133 --> 13:49.533
I'D LIKE TO SHARE.

13:49.533 --> 13:52.233
- I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT THEME

13:52.266 --> 13:54.033
WHICH IS A CHERISHED RETURN--

13:54.033 --> 13:55.633

- OH.

HE WAS JUST ASKING ME IF
I WANTED CREAM CHEESE ON THAT.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.567
- OKAY, WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE A SOURCE--YOU'RE A COP.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.300
- MAGGIE...Y-YOU KNOW
THAT HE'S PROBABLY

15:27.333 --> 15:28.600
JUST FINE, RIGHT?

15:28.633 --> 15:30.367
- YEAH, WELL, HOW WOULD
I KNOW THAT?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.600
- BECAUSE HE'S A GROWN-ASS
MAN, MARGARET.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.100
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
BLOWING OFF SOME STEAM

15:35.100 --> 15:36.500
AT A DAVE & BUSTER'S.

15:36.533 --> 15:38.233
- HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

15:38.266 --> 15:40.033
HE ALWAYS CALLS ME BACK.

15:40.066 --> 15:43.633
- WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN DIVORCED BEFORE.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.500
- I'M STILL NOT
TECHNICALLY DIVORCED NOW.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.200
- YEAH.
YOU NEED TO GET ON THAT.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.367
- GOD, WHY DOES EVERYBODY
KEEP TELLING ME THAT?

15:49.367 --> 15:51.133
- YOU STILL DON'T WANT TO BE
MARRIED TO THE GUY, DO YOU?

15:51.166 --> 15:53.100
- NO. OF COURSE NOT.
- THEN YOU GOTTA LET HIM GO.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.500
- WELL, I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT OVERNIGHT?

15:55.533 --> 15:58.000
I WAS WITH HIM FOR 13 YEARS.
IT'S NOT--YOU JUST TURN OFF

15:58.000 --> 15:59.567
CARING ABOUT SOMEBODY
LIKE THAT.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.433
- I KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT TAKES...

16:01.467 --> 16:03.533
IT TAKES TIME.
IT'S A PROCESS.

16:03.567 --> 16:05.233
IT'S JUST, UH...
I DON'T KNOW,

16:05.266 --> 16:07.567
YOU KNOW, LIKE WITH--
WHEN--WHEN EMMA LEFT.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.734
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS--
THAT SUCKED.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.533
BUT, UH, EVENTUALLY,
I GOT OVER IT.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.166
- MM-HMM.
- WHICH DOESN'T MEAN

16:13.200 --> 16:15.133
YOU STOP CARING, YOU KNOW,
IT'S...

16:15.166 --> 16:17.533
YOU JUST GET OVER IT.
- SO YOU STILL CARE ABOUT HER?

16:17.533 --> 16:20.033
- OKAY, SLOW YOUR ROLL,
CLARICE.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.000
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME.
- YOU SAID YOU ALWAYS

16:22.033 --> 16:23.667
WILL CARE ABOUT HER.
- I'M JUST SAYING IN GENERAL

16:23.667 --> 16:25.734
FOR MOST--FOR ALL...
HUMANS

16:25.767 --> 16:27.567
THAT WHEN YOU BREAK UP
WITH SOME--

16:27.600 --> 16:29.600
NOW, WHY--DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.166
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.600
- IT'S JUST SO CRAZY
HOW WE ENDED UP HERE, YOU KNOW?

16:33.633 --> 16:35.667
WHEN IT WAS STARTING,
IT WAS SO GOOD,

16:35.700 --> 16:38.266
AND HE WAS, LIKE, SO SWEET
ON OUR FIRST DATE.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.467
- WHAT'D YOU GUYS DO?

16:39.500 --> 16:43.700
- HE MADE ME TILAPIA
ROLLED IN CRUSHED PRETZELS.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.533
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE
A TAKE FIVE BAR BUT WITH FISH.

16:46.567 --> 16:50.033
[both laughing]

16:50.066 --> 16:51.700
AND THEN...
HE TOOK ME ON A WALK.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.100
HE SAID HE JUST WANTED
TO WALK.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.367
THEN WE STOPPED
AND GOT COKE FLOATS,

16:56.400 --> 16:58.767
AND THEN WE JUST SAT IN A--

16:59.000 --> 17:01.033
OH, MY GOD.
[laughs]

17:01.033 --> 17:03.000
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.000
- YOU DO?
- LET'S GO. YEAH.

17:05.033 --> 17:06.300
LET'S GO.
- NO. NO, NO, NO.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.066
WE DON'T PUT THAT ON
UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.367
- MARK.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.200
- RIGHT. SCREW IT. YEAH.
LET'S PUT IT ON.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.133
- FIRE 'EM UP AND TEAR IT OFF
AND TEAR IT DOWN!

17:14.166 --> 17:15.467
[siren wailing]
- WE'RE NOT TEARING

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
ANYTHING OFF.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.633
- OH, BRUCE.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.033
[clears throat]

17:41.467 --> 17:45.000
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU,
BUDDY?

17:45.033 --> 17:47.467
- WHEN YOU CALLED AND SAID
FOR ME TO PICK UP MY BOXES,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.367
I JUST THOUGHT...

17:49.400 --> 17:51.066
I'M NOT READY
FOR THIS TO BE OVER.

17:51.066 --> 17:53.333
- BUT YOU CHEATED ON ME.

17:53.367 --> 17:54.734
- FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
I'M GONNA BE WISHING

17:54.767 --> 17:56.767
I COULD GET IN THAT DELOREAN
AND GO BACK IN TIME

17:57.000 --> 17:59.400
JUST BEFORE IT HAPPENED
AND THEN NOT DO THAT.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.533
- OKAY, WELL, YOU WOULD
HAVE TO TAKE THE DELOREAN

18:01.567 --> 18:03.033
BACK EVEN FURTHER,

18:03.066 --> 18:06.433
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY
FOR, LIKE, A LONG TIME.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.333
RIGHT, MCFLY?

18:08.367 --> 18:10.667
- BUT YOU FOUND ME, SO...

18:10.700 --> 18:12.633
OBVIOUSLY, THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MUST HAVE

18:12.667 --> 18:14.367
SOME FEELINGS LEFT FOR ME.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.767
- YEAH, OF COURSE I DO.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.433
AND I WILL ALWAYS CARE
ABOUT YOU,

18:17.467 --> 18:18.500
BUT IT'S REALLY OVER.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.400
AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD
AND WEIRD

18:20.433 --> 18:22.700
AND, YOU KNOW, UNCOMFORTABLE

18:22.734 --> 18:24.500
AND COMPLICATED,

18:24.533 --> 18:27.433
BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT,
AND WE NEED TO DO IT SOON,

18:27.467 --> 18:29.233
BECAUSE WHEN SHE COMES OUT,

18:29.266 --> 18:31.767
WE GOTTA AT LEAST PRETEND
THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.300
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

18:33.333 --> 18:34.667
- YEAH.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.300
'CAUSE I DEFINITELY
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.100
- NEITHER DO I.
- I'M GONNA SURPRISE YOU

18:38.100 --> 18:39.367
AND BE GREAT AT THAT, THOUGH.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.100
- I HOPE YOU ARE.

18:41.133 --> 18:42.667
- I'M A DARK HORSE.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.400
- [chuckling]
OKAY.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.233
WELL, I WOULD ASK IF YOU
WANT A RIDE HOME, BUT, UM...

18:47.266 --> 18:49.133
I'M TRYING TO WORK ON
MY BOUNDARIES.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.133
- ME TOO.
PLUS I WANNA WALK A LITTLE.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.533
- OKAY. GOOD IDEA.
- YEAH.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.033
- ALL RIGHT, COME GET YOUR
BOXES AND, UM,

18:55.066 --> 18:57.266
ALSO, EMMA ATE ALL YOUR
CHEESE.

18:57.266 --> 19:00.266
- I'M SORRY?
- I SAID EMMA ATE YOUR CHEESE.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.400
- HA. THAT'S FUNNY.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.400
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU SAID
EMMA ATE ALL MY CHEESE.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.667
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

19:04.700 --> 19:08.600
- DID YOU EVER THINK
YOU WOULD LIVE TO SEE THE DAY

19:08.633 --> 19:11.000
YOU'D HAVE YOUR OWN
CRAFTING CORNER?

19:11.033 --> 19:12.266
- LOOK--I COULD TAKE
A MASON JAR,

19:12.266 --> 19:14.266
FILL IT WITH HANDMADE
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES,

19:14.266 --> 19:17.300
WRAP IT IN A RAFFIA RIBBON
OFF MY RIBBON ORGANIZER,

19:17.333 --> 19:19.100
AND THEN HERE YOU GO--
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

19:19.133 --> 19:21.133
- I MEAN, SEE?
YOU GET RID OF BRUCE'S GARBAGE,

19:21.133 --> 19:22.533
YOU'RE LIVING
A GODDAMN DREAM.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.300
- STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PAGES
OF PINTEREST.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.133
- YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY DON'T
KNOW WHY IT TOOK YOU SO LONG

19:26.166 --> 19:28.266
TO MOVEON.ORG, RIGHT?
- WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.667
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M JUST SAYING

19:29.700 --> 19:31.400
I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE
THAT WE HAVE TROUBLE

19:31.433 --> 19:33.033
MOVING ON FROM
OLD RELATIONSHIPS, RIGHT?

19:33.033 --> 19:36.333
- WHAT, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
ME AND MY MOM?

19:36.367 --> 19:38.233
OH!

19:38.266 --> 19:41.100
GREAT! SO NOW YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN WRAPPING STATION,

19:41.133 --> 19:42.700
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING?

19:42.700 --> 19:45.000
WELL, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.633
- HERE YOU GO.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.433
LITTLE SUNSHINE FOR YA.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.567
- DO I HAVE TO GO
TALK TO HER NOW?

19:53.200 --> 19:55.166
- NOW.
- DO I HAVE TO--

19:55.166 --> 19:56.500
- YEAH.
- BLEHH!

20:01.433 --> 20:03.266
- UM, MOM?

20:03.300 --> 20:04.700
- AH, HERE WE GO.
- NO, NO.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.467
I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE A SCENE.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.633
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I GET IT.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.633
YOU DON'T WANT
A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.767
THAT'S FINE.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
SO I'M GONNA STOP
PURSUING YOU, ALL RIGHT?

20:15.033 --> 20:16.166
SO...

20:16.200 --> 20:19.200
GOOD DAY TO YOU, MOTHER.

20:19.233 --> 20:22.200
- WHY DO YOU WANT A RELATIONSHIP
WITH ME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

20:22.233 --> 20:25.200
WHEN ALL YOU EVER SAID I DID
WAS IRRITATE YOU?

20:25.200 --> 20:28.166
- I DON'T KNOW.
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY MOM.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.333
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

20:30.367 --> 20:32.700
THAT YOUR HAIR COULD USE
MY LAYERS?

20:32.734 --> 20:35.066
THAT...YOUR SKIN TONE
IS ASHY?

20:35.066 --> 20:37.433
GRAY? MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE A CORPSE.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.033
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

20:39.066 --> 20:42.066
YOU LOOK BETTER
IN SATURATED COLORS!

20:42.100 --> 20:43.734
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD?

20:43.767 --> 20:47.166
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
- I'M HUGGING YOU, MOM.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.467
DO THIS.

20:54.633 --> 20:57.367
- ARE WE SLOW DANCING NOW?
- OKAY.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.767
- ARE YOU REALLY WEARING...

20:58.767 --> 21:00.600
A THONG RIGHT NOW?
[Emma chuckles]

21:00.633 --> 21:02.600
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.367
- GOOD-BYE, MOM.
- THAT YEAST

21:04.367 --> 21:06.367
IS MULTIPLYING AS WE SPEAK.

21:06.367 --> 21:09.133
YOU NEED TO LET IT BREATHE!

21:14.066 --> 21:15.300
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
OR THIS.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.633
- "A 'POME'.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.533
TRANSCENDENTLY CRUSHED
BY MALCOLM-JAMAL WARNER.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.000
[weird voice]
"THE BONES WITHERED.

21:24.033 --> 21:27.367
THE PRISON IS THE REAL ZOO."

21:27.400 --> 21:30.333
(high baby voice)
AH! I'M SCARED!

21:30.367 --> 21:34.400
[wailing]
OH! OH, NO!

21:34.433 --> 21:36.567
AH...

21:36.600 --> 21:38.033
AH!

21:38.066 --> 21:40.600
- IT'S...WONDERFUL.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.600
- IT'S NOT DONE.
- WHAT? OH.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.467
- [loudly]
AH...

21:44.500 --> 21:46.000
OH--
- I'D RATHER WATCH A MAN

21:46.033 --> 21:47.500
EAT ANOTHER MAN'S FACE OFF

21:47.533 --> 21:49.533
THAN ENDURE ONE MORE
SECOND OF THIS.

21:49.533 --> 21:50.734
- OKAY.
- ARE YOU SURE?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.433
- YEAH.
- OKAY, THEN, ZACH,

21:52.467 --> 21:54.100
YOUR WORK HERE IS DONE.
- WHAT?

21:54.133 --> 21:56.033
NO, NO, WHAT IS HAPPENING?
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO

21:56.066 --> 21:57.533
DO THIS--PLEASE!
- YOU SAID YOU WERE

21:57.533 --> 22:00.600
GONNA WATCH IT.
