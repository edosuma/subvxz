- Wow! Better than a bank!

07:59.827 --> 08:03.047
In fact, I could go
for a nice dip right about now.

Gloria, no! The diving board
was a mistake!

a lot to brag about!

08:52.706 --> 08:55.665
Wait. Did you not want to
brag about me before?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.667
- Huh?
- Did you even care?

08:57.711 --> 08:59.364
Before I had all this stuff.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.323
We didn't know
what you were doing before.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.891
You always say,
"Now's not a good time."

09:03.934 --> 09:07.242
Well <i>maybe</i> that's because
every time you visit,

09:07.285 --> 09:10.027
all you do is compare me
to my <i>cousin...</i>

09:10.071 --> 09:11.289
- Emily?
- Emily!

09:11.333 --> 09:12.769
We thought stories
of her success

09:12.813 --> 09:14.945
would inspire you to try harder.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.948
Sometimes, we feel like
you need a little push.

09:17.992 --> 09:22.344
A little push? The last thing
I need is a push from <i>you!</i>

09:22.387 --> 09:24.259
Sometimes, stress is good.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.653
You got a big mansion
out of it, didn't you?

09:26.696 --> 09:28.524
It all worked out.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.745
[laughs] Well, that's where
you're wrong,

09:31.788 --> 09:33.877
because actually...

09:33.921 --> 09:35.879
- I have nothing.
- [both] Hm?

09:35.923 --> 09:40.057
That's right! The big mansion,
the kids, the two houses...

09:40.101 --> 09:43.931
it was all just lies!
In truth, I lost my job.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.846
- [both gasp]
- My art work never sells,

09:45.889 --> 09:47.717
so my art career
has gone nowhere.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.938
- [both gasp]
- And I had to rely on children

09:50.981 --> 09:52.983
to pull off this elaborate ruse!

09:53.027 --> 09:54.071
Weird flex.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.464
So take that!

09:55.507 --> 09:58.641
I'm a huge... failure.

09:58.685 --> 09:59.990
I... I didn't want to tell you,

10:00.034 --> 10:02.210
because I didn't want to
disappoint you.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.909
Oh, Gloria. We had no idea you
were having such a hard time.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.085
We never meant
to push you so hard

10:08.129 --> 10:10.087
that you feel like
you had to lie to us.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.002
We want you to succeed, but...

10:12.046 --> 10:15.049
You do not have to succeed
for us to love you.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.094
However, it does look like
we need to do

10:17.138 --> 10:19.662
a much better job
of expressing it, huh?

10:19.706 --> 10:23.057
[sighs deeply]
That sounds great!

10:23.100 --> 10:25.712
Thanks for having us
over for dinner, Mr. Green.

10:25.755 --> 10:28.062
Oh, don't mention it.
Your Gloria's a good kid

10:28.105 --> 10:30.151
and definitely not my wife!

10:30.194 --> 10:31.456
[both]
We know! We know!

10:31.500 --> 10:33.067
You don't have to
keep saying it.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.330
I remember being young.
It's hard work.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.897
You couldn't pay me
to do it again.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.856
[coughs] Pay me!
I'll be young! How much? What?!

10:39.900 --> 10:41.336
You've done well, Gloria.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.425
You're surrounded
by good people.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.036
And we know
you are doing your best.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.430
[Mrs. Sato] We're both really,
really proud of you.

10:48.473 --> 10:51.912
Aw, Mom, that felt
so good to hear!

10:51.955 --> 10:54.218
Yes, yes. Now quit slouching.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.935
- [grunting]
- Yeah, but if
you still need someone

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
to shower with gifts,
just call me "grandbaby."

10:57.961 --> 10:59.920
[Bill] Cricket, get off
Mr. Sato's lap.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
Pfft. Worth a shot.
