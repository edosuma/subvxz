WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.349
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.487 --> 00:07.214
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.352 --> 00:11.908
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.046 --> 00:14.842
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.980 --> 00:17.776
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.914 --> 00:21.918
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.575 --> 00:25.956
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.095 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.964
Just to get up that hill

00:34.103 --> 00:36.519
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.657 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.593
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.731 --> 00:43.319
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.115
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.253 --> 00:49.118
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.256 --> 00:53.708
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.846 --> 00:56.573
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.711 --> 00:59.576
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.714 --> 01:05.617
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:10.242 --> 01:11.243
Mmm.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.181
Helen Willis told me
the funniest story

01:18.319 --> 01:20.390
about this woman
with a dumb husband.

01:21.357 --> 01:22.737
One morning,
he got out of bed

01:22.875 --> 01:26.016
and he said, "Boy,
I got a headache again."

01:26.603 --> 01:27.708
And she said,

01:27.846 --> 01:29.779
"How many times do I
have to tell you?

01:29.917 --> 01:32.333
"You're supposed to
get out of bed feet first."

01:38.063 --> 01:41.722
Honestly, I don't know where
Helen finds those funny jokes!

01:43.517 --> 01:45.243
Same place she found
her funny husband.

01:49.178 --> 01:50.524
I got to get ready
for work.

01:52.836 --> 01:53.975
Oh, but George,
you're the boss.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.632
Take it easy.

01:55.770 --> 01:58.187
Why do you have to
rush out of here so early
on a Saturday?

01:58.325 --> 02:00.603
'Cause they got problems
up in the Bronx.

02:00.741 --> 02:02.639
I had to fire
my new counterman

02:02.777 --> 02:04.296
for working
on the steam cleaner.

02:04.434 --> 02:05.987
You fired him for that?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.265
Yeah, I fired her too.

02:13.305 --> 02:15.169
George, is you work
so important

02:15.307 --> 02:17.137
that we don't even
have time to talk?

02:17.275 --> 02:18.448
Of course not.

02:18.586 --> 02:19.967
You mean
we can talk now?

02:20.105 --> 02:21.658
Sure.
Oh, good!

02:21.796 --> 02:23.764
Grab your coat.
We can talk on
the way to the store.

02:23.902 --> 02:25.283
Oh, no, you don't.

02:25.421 --> 02:27.457
I want you to
come and sit down.

02:30.771 --> 02:31.944
Relax!

02:34.188 --> 02:35.465
Okay. You happy?

02:35.603 --> 02:38.296
No. I mean, really relax
for a change.

02:38.434 --> 02:39.469
Read the paper.

02:40.056 --> 02:41.091
Okay.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.300
Here it is.

02:42.438 --> 02:43.542
"Stock market.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.854
"Dow Jones
off two points."

02:44.992 --> 02:46.027
Huh.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.513
Okay, I read the paper.
Satisfied?

02:48.651 --> 02:52.137
George! It's not healthy
to work as hard as you do.

02:52.275 --> 02:53.828
Look, if I don't work,
we don't eat.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.175
And that
ain't healthy either.

02:56.383 --> 02:58.212
All you think about
is business...

02:58.350 --> 02:59.420
Business, business.

02:59.558 --> 03:02.112
BOTH: And all you do
is work, work, work.

03:02.251 --> 03:03.907
You sound like
a broken record, Weezy.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.426
Unless you learn
to relax,

03:05.564 --> 03:07.117
you're gonna be
a broken man.

03:07.256 --> 03:08.705
I relax every time
I go to bed.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.811
I fall asleep as soon as
my head hits the pillow.

03:11.915 --> 03:13.123
I know.

03:16.023 --> 03:17.162
Look.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.922
I'll spend a lot of time
with you tonight.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.165
I promise.

03:20.303 --> 03:22.926
Well, you could take
an occasional Saturday off.

03:23.548 --> 03:24.721
Why? What would
I do?

03:24.859 --> 03:25.826
Nothing.

03:25.964 --> 03:27.068
I don't like
doing nothing.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.587
Then take up a hobby.

03:28.725 --> 03:29.657
Like what?

03:29.795 --> 03:31.003
Anything.

03:31.141 --> 03:35.042
Uh, music, stamp collecting,
even needlepoint.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.770
Needlepoint! That's for women.
People will laugh at me.

03:38.908 --> 03:42.325
For your information,
Rosie Grier does needlepoint.

03:42.463 --> 03:44.154
Oh.

03:44.293 --> 03:46.398
And for your information,
Rosie Grier is 6 foot 6,
weighs 300 pounds.

03:46.536 --> 03:47.917
And ain't nobody going to
laugh at nothing that big,

03:48.055 --> 03:49.332
no matter
what it's doing.

03:53.198 --> 03:55.821
Well, there must
be something.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.720
Didn't you have a hobby
when you were a kid?

03:57.858 --> 03:59.480
Yeah! Foxhunting.

03:59.618 --> 04:00.861
What?

04:00.999 --> 04:02.380
Yeah, me and the guys
used to stand on the corner,

04:02.518 --> 04:03.760
watch all
the foxes go by.

04:03.898 --> 04:06.280
"Hey! I like that cute
little fat one there. Hey!"

04:08.903 --> 04:11.009
George,
I'm being serious.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.838
So were we. Huh.

04:12.976 --> 04:14.323
Besides, I already
got a hobby.

04:14.461 --> 04:15.531
You do?

04:15.669 --> 04:17.257
Yep. Collecting coins.

04:18.948 --> 04:20.225
Oh, forget it.

04:20.363 --> 04:21.502
Okay, Weezy. You win.

04:22.503 --> 04:24.056
I'll be glad
to take up a hobby.

04:24.194 --> 04:25.368
You will?

04:25.506 --> 04:27.543
Just find me one I can do
while I'm working.

04:27.681 --> 04:29.786
Oh, I give up
on you, George.

04:33.825 --> 04:36.931
Oh, Mr. J. I'm going fishing
and I'm in need of a cork.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.279
Yeah, 'cause you popped yours
a long time ago, Bentley.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.144
Do you have one
I can borrow?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.940
No. But if we did,
what would you do with it?

04:46.078 --> 04:48.840
Oh, I find that a cork
is marvelous for my flies.

04:48.978 --> 04:51.118
Oh! Why don't you just use
zippers like everybody else?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.123
Oh, no, no.
I mean trout flies.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.021
Trout flies, like
this little beauty here.

04:58.159 --> 04:59.160
Oh, yeah.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.403
Where you
going fishing, Bentley?

05:00.541 --> 05:03.337
Well, I have this friend
who has his own plane...

05:03.475 --> 05:04.959
Oh, you going
after flying fish?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.343
That's droll, Mr. J.

05:09.481 --> 05:11.621
No, we're going up
to Vermont for the weekend.
Uh-huh.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.554
To get there and back
in time, we have to fly.

05:13.692 --> 05:15.107
Huh. Sounds great.

05:15.245 --> 05:16.316
Well, I got to
get to work.

05:16.454 --> 05:18.421
Ah, flying is
the only way to go.

05:18.559 --> 05:21.251
That exhilarating moment
when one is suddenly airborne,

05:21.390 --> 05:23.426
able to pierce
the clouds,

05:23.564 --> 05:26.084
the wonderful feeling
of looking down at the birds.

05:26.222 --> 05:27.913
Yeah. It's a hell of
a lot safer

05:28.051 --> 05:29.087
than looking up at them.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.608
Oh, there's nothing
like flying.

05:32.746 --> 05:34.506
Oh, I know.

05:34.644 --> 05:36.612
I saw a lot of flying
while I was in the service.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.027
Oh, then you know
the feeling.

05:38.165 --> 05:41.306
No, I said I saw a lot
of flying. I never did any.

05:41.444 --> 05:43.343
Where'd your friend learn
how to fly? In the service?

05:43.481 --> 05:46.794
No, one day he wandered into
a flight school in Flushing

05:46.932 --> 05:49.556
and he got his pilot's license
in just a few short months.

05:49.694 --> 05:51.523
You mean that's all
it takes? A few months?

05:51.661 --> 05:53.560
That and $1,700.

05:53.698 --> 05:54.975
Oh! Wow!

05:55.113 --> 05:56.183
You mean if
I walked in

05:56.321 --> 05:57.598
and plunked
$1,700 on the table,

05:57.736 --> 05:58.979
they'd teach me
to fly a plane?

05:59.117 --> 06:00.187
Certainly.

06:00.325 --> 06:01.395
Hmm.

06:01.533 --> 06:02.707
That sounds like fun.

06:02.845 --> 06:04.536
Wish I had
the time to do it.

06:04.674 --> 06:07.263
Oh, lots of
successful businessmen
are making the time.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.128
They're all taking up
flying as a hobby.

06:10.266 --> 06:11.785
Hey, Bentley! I just got
a great idea!

06:11.923 --> 06:13.614
I want to take up
flying as a hobby!

06:14.304 --> 06:16.134
I say, that is
a good idea.

06:16.272 --> 06:17.687
Oh, that's right, you got
to get up to Vermont.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.137
Shame you're
in such a hurry.

06:19.275 --> 06:20.414
Why, thank you, Mr. J.

06:20.552 --> 06:22.312
I completely forgot
about the time.

06:22.451 --> 06:23.900
My goodness.
Standing here chat...

06:24.038 --> 06:25.212
Weezy!

06:26.696 --> 06:27.663
Weezy!

06:28.629 --> 06:29.906
What is it, George?

06:30.044 --> 06:31.736
When you're right,
you are really right.

06:31.874 --> 06:32.944
Mwah!

06:33.082 --> 06:34.359
Oh, thank you.

06:34.497 --> 06:35.912
What was I
right about?

06:36.050 --> 06:38.087
About me taking a hobby.
I'm going to do it.

06:38.225 --> 06:39.571
That's perfect!

06:39.709 --> 06:40.848
What did you decide on?

06:40.986 --> 06:42.643
Off we go

06:42.781 --> 06:44.196
Into the wild
blue yonder

06:44.334 --> 06:46.233
You're going to
take up singing!

06:48.304 --> 06:49.616
No. Flying.

06:50.099 --> 06:51.480
Flying what?

06:51.618 --> 06:52.791
An airplane!
You know!

06:56.208 --> 06:58.590
Well, where did you get
a crazy idea like that?

06:58.728 --> 07:00.834
From Bentley.
He put the bee
in my bonnet.

07:03.181 --> 07:06.046
It looks more like
bats in your belfry.

07:06.184 --> 07:08.082
What are you talking about?
Flying's a great sport.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.464
For pigeons,
not for my husband.

07:10.602 --> 07:13.156
Wait a minute. You said
you wanted me to take
up a hobby, didn't you?

07:13.294 --> 07:16.056
Suicide is not a hobby.

07:16.194 --> 07:18.127
Oh, get out of here. Look,
flying is real safe nowadays.

07:18.265 --> 07:21.337
What about all those
private plane crashes
you read about?

07:21.475 --> 07:23.546
What about all those
car accidents you read about?

07:23.684 --> 07:24.685
Well, that's different.

07:24.823 --> 07:26.376
How?
I don't know!

07:26.515 --> 07:27.964
But I just don't want
you to fly.

07:28.102 --> 07:30.691
Look, Weezy, flying
is something I've
always wanted to do

07:30.829 --> 07:33.867
ever since I was in the navy
on an aircraft carrier.

07:34.005 --> 07:36.179
I used to always be
jealous of the flyboys.

07:36.317 --> 07:39.286
The whole crew used to look up
at them and down on me.

07:40.563 --> 07:42.565
Well, why would the crew
look down on you?

07:42.703 --> 07:44.774
'Cause I was five decks below,
peeling potatoes.

07:47.605 --> 07:49.469
And you are still
jealous of the pilots

07:49.607 --> 07:50.711
after all these years?

07:50.849 --> 07:52.851
There's just some things
you never get over, Weezy.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.612
Like I'm still mad
at those kids in school

07:54.750 --> 07:57.235
who used to hang my
coat on the top nail
in the clothes closet.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.823
What was wrong
with that?

07:58.961 --> 08:00.203
I was still in it.

08:03.862 --> 08:05.933
Oh, that was
a long time ago.

08:06.071 --> 08:07.625
You're not
a kid anymore.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.178
You're a married
man now,

08:09.316 --> 08:11.387
with responsibilities.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.700
Besides, you're too old
to start flying.

08:13.838 --> 08:15.943
No, I ain't! I'm just
as young as I ever was.

08:16.081 --> 08:17.669
But George...
No! But nothing, Weezy.

08:17.807 --> 08:19.637
Look, a man has got to
do what he's got to do.

08:19.775 --> 08:21.673
And being up there
in the wild blue yonder

08:21.811 --> 08:23.606
is what I gotta do.

08:23.744 --> 08:26.885
Oh, who do you think
you are? John Wayne?

08:27.023 --> 08:28.231
No!
George Jefferson.

08:28.369 --> 08:29.923
I don't like nobody
bossing me around.

08:30.061 --> 08:31.476
And that goes
for my wife too.

08:31.614 --> 08:33.374
Now, I am telling you I don't
want to hear no more about it.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.997
Oh, now, wait a minute...
Not another word!

08:35.135 --> 08:36.688
Well, don't you
boss me around either!

08:36.826 --> 08:39.035
I ain't bossing you around!
I'm telling you what to do.

08:41.935 --> 08:43.108
If you think...

08:43.246 --> 08:45.317
No more talking.
Look, I'm going flying.
That's it.

08:45.455 --> 08:47.078
Uh, George, wait.
You can't.

08:47.216 --> 08:48.528
Why not?

08:48.666 --> 08:51.185
Uh, because you said you
had to work today. Remember?

08:51.323 --> 08:54.326
Work! Weezy, is that
all you think of, is
work, work, work?

08:54.464 --> 08:56.397
Look, now, I'm taking
flying lessons, and that's it.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.607
But George,
it's dangerous.

08:58.745 --> 09:00.609
How can you be
so selfish?

09:00.747 --> 09:02.921
Selfish! Me, selfish?
I'm not the one
who's selfish.

09:03.059 --> 09:04.371
You're the one
who's being selfish.

09:04.509 --> 09:06.304
You try to stop me from doing
something I want to do.

09:06.442 --> 09:07.581
Look, if I want to
take a chance

09:07.719 --> 09:09.687
on spilling my blood,
it's my business.

09:09.825 --> 09:12.068
Well, half of your blood
is mine.

09:12.206 --> 09:15.002
And I want to keep
my half in your body.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.108
And I forbid
you to go.

09:17.246 --> 09:19.144
What?
You forbid me?

09:19.282 --> 09:20.560
Ha!
Now, that did it.

09:20.698 --> 09:22.941
Just for that, I'm going
whether I want to or not.

09:25.288 --> 09:27.152
Well, go ahead
and see if I care.

09:27.290 --> 09:29.810
Flushing Airport,
here I come.
Over and out!

09:33.331 --> 09:35.747
Oh, George!
I didn't mean it!
Come back!

09:36.541 --> 09:37.715
George!

09:42.892 --> 09:44.342
You made the right choice,
Mr. Jefferson.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.068
You couldn't have picked
a better flying school

09:46.206 --> 09:47.241
if you tried.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.967
We think we're
the best in the east.

09:49.278 --> 09:50.382
Good.

09:54.697 --> 09:56.250
I want to go up on
your trial flight right now.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.321
Uh, wouldn't you rather
wait for a plane?

09:59.875 --> 10:01.290
One will be available
in 15 minutes.

10:01.428 --> 10:02.636
Oh, yeah? What kind
we going up with?

10:02.774 --> 10:04.500
Well, we're going up
in one just like this

10:04.638 --> 10:06.502
little beauty
right over here.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.676
Oh, yeah?

10:07.814 --> 10:09.609
Yeah, it's a
very good aircraft.

10:09.747 --> 10:10.886
Very reliable.

10:11.024 --> 10:12.750
It climbs smoothly,
lots of power.

10:12.888 --> 10:15.028
And when you level it out,
it's smooth sailing.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.546
It's one of the safest
I've ever flown.

10:16.685 --> 10:17.720
Oh...

10:19.619 --> 10:20.689
Well, while
we're waiting,

10:20.827 --> 10:22.449
maybe I better fill you in
on ground school.

10:22.587 --> 10:23.761
Look, can't we just
skip all that stuff?

10:23.899 --> 10:25.452
I want to do
all my learning up there!

10:25.590 --> 10:27.523
Ah, but you can't get your
ticket without ground school,

10:27.661 --> 10:28.662
Mr. Jefferson.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.250
Besides, you shouldn't
go up there

10:30.388 --> 10:32.217
until you've learned
a few things down here.

10:32.355 --> 10:33.943
Flying is very safe today,

10:34.081 --> 10:36.463
but you want to be prepared
for any emergencies.

10:36.601 --> 10:37.567
Emergencies?

10:37.706 --> 10:39.535
Yeah, like navigating
in bad weather.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.881
Well, I ain't got
to worry about that.

10:41.019 --> 10:42.676
I'm only gonna fly
when it's nice and sunny.

10:44.264 --> 10:45.852
But you can get
caught by surprise.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.267
Sunny skies one minute,

10:47.405 --> 10:49.959
a blinding rainstorm
or fog the next.

10:50.097 --> 10:51.720
Suppose you get off-course.

10:51.858 --> 10:54.170
Your gas tank reads empty.
There's zero visibility.

10:54.308 --> 10:55.965
Then what do you do?

10:56.103 --> 10:57.346
Then I go
to ground school.

11:00.211 --> 11:03.110
Well, we like to try to cover
every possible emergency

11:03.248 --> 11:04.594
in our
instruction program.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.148
Um, forced landing.

11:06.286 --> 11:08.564
What to do if ice
forms on the wings.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.877
How to keep from stalling.
Dead reckoning...

11:11.015 --> 11:11.981
Dead what?

11:12.119 --> 11:13.396
Reckoning.

11:13.534 --> 11:15.502
That's navigating when
you don't know where you are.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.055
Oh.

11:17.193 --> 11:19.471
Hey. Answer me
one thing.

11:19.609 --> 11:21.197
Are you sure
these planes are safe?

11:21.335 --> 11:22.889
Oh, absolutely.

11:23.027 --> 11:24.304
If there is
an accident,

11:24.442 --> 11:26.582
in almost every case
it's the fault of the pilot.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.204
Oh, you mean some dummy's
up there flying

11:28.342 --> 11:29.930
ain't got no business?

11:30.068 --> 11:32.381
Oh, that's right.
That's why we're so
strict on our students.

11:32.519 --> 11:33.796
I remember
this one student

11:33.934 --> 11:36.005
who wasn't very serious
about ground school.

11:36.143 --> 11:37.420
One day he was flying.

11:37.558 --> 11:39.319
And I said to him, "Okay,
now read your instruments.

11:39.457 --> 11:40.630
"Do you know
where you are?"

11:40.769 --> 11:42.598
And he said, "Sure, I know
exactly where I am.

11:42.736 --> 11:43.703
"I'm lost."

11:45.049 --> 11:46.429
Did he ever learn
how to fly the plane?

11:46.567 --> 11:48.742
Uh, no, I'm afraid not.
He never finished the course.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.950
You mean he dropped out?

11:50.088 --> 11:51.883
Yeah. Over
Long Island Sound.

11:52.159 --> 11:53.229
Ooh.

11:55.266 --> 11:56.508
But you don't
have to worry.

11:56.646 --> 11:59.166
We don't turn out anything
but safe pilots here.

11:59.304 --> 12:00.616
Oh, I'm glad
to hear that.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.101
'Cause all I want to do
is just fly across the skies,

12:03.239 --> 12:04.585
soaring
30,000 feet...

12:04.724 --> 12:06.173
Uh-uh. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

12:06.311 --> 12:08.451
The type of plane you'll be
flying won't go that high.

12:08.589 --> 12:10.799
Besides, you need
oxygen after 12,000.

12:10.937 --> 12:12.076
Oxygen?

12:12.214 --> 12:13.940
Why, sure.
Otherwise you pass out.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.702
Oh, but there's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.980
All our planes have the latest
and the best equipment.

12:20.118 --> 12:23.121
ADF, ELT,
artificial horizon,

12:23.259 --> 12:25.952
digital readout
for the CDI and the DMEs.

12:26.815 --> 12:27.988
Uh-huh.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.335
And, of course,
there's the radio.

12:30.473 --> 12:33.062
It's no sweat. If you have
a problem, they talk you down.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.823
I got the tower now.

12:44.177 --> 12:46.696
You see? You just do
what they tell you
and you can't miss.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.422
Yeah, but I couldn't
understand a word
he was saying.

12:49.285 --> 12:50.424
You get used to it.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.150
No, I won't. Look,
if I get in trouble,

12:52.288 --> 12:54.083
I just grab my parachute
and bail out.

12:55.498 --> 12:57.052
We don't use
parachutes.

12:57.190 --> 12:58.294
No?

12:58.432 --> 12:59.951
No, no,
they're too dangerous.

13:00.089 --> 13:02.920
You have no idea
how many people get
killed in those things.

13:03.058 --> 13:04.680
What am I going to do
without a parachute?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.821
Well, you make
a forced landing in a
field or on a highway.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.167
Your chances are
almost always better.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.343
Oh.
Unless you get
hit by a car.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.346
Yeah, hello.
Stratton.

13:15.484 --> 13:16.519
What?

13:16.657 --> 13:18.245
Oh, good!
Thank you, Jack.

13:18.383 --> 13:20.661
Good news, Mr. Jefferson.
There's a plane available.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.836
I can take you up
on your test flight now.

13:36.263 --> 13:38.472
Oh, Tom, Helen,
thanks for coming down.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.577
I would have come up
to see you,

13:39.715 --> 13:40.923
but I don't wanna
leave the phone.

13:41.061 --> 13:42.373
Why? What's
the emergency?

13:42.511 --> 13:44.099
George is gonna
kill himself!

13:44.237 --> 13:45.445
What? Where is he?

13:45.963 --> 13:47.033
Up there.

13:47.171 --> 13:48.586
Oh, my God, already?

13:52.003 --> 13:53.349
In a plane.

13:53.487 --> 13:54.661
You mean
he's gonna jump?

13:54.799 --> 13:56.352
No. He's taking
flying lessons.

13:56.490 --> 13:57.629
BOTH: Ohh.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.286
What's so bad
about that?

13:59.424 --> 14:01.668
He'll probably crash into
a mountain or something,

14:01.806 --> 14:03.221
and it's all my fault.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.223
Relax, Louise.
Have a drink.

14:05.361 --> 14:06.500
No, thanks.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.261
I wanna be sober
when they bring me the news,

14:08.399 --> 14:09.676
then I'll get drunk.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.403
What do you mean
it's all your fault?

14:12.541 --> 14:15.751
Well, I kept harping on George
to take up a hobby,

14:15.889 --> 14:18.167
and he decided
to take up flying.

14:18.305 --> 14:21.515
Is that all?
You're worrying
yourself needlessly.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.723
I am?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.761
Yes. Flying isn't
dangerous anymore.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.315
It's as a safe as walking
the streets of New York.

14:30.524 --> 14:31.732
I'm sorry. Bad example.

14:33.527 --> 14:35.495
Did you tell George
you didn't want him to fly?

14:35.633 --> 14:37.773
Yes, and the more
I told him not to,

14:37.911 --> 14:39.706
the more he insisted
on doing it.

14:39.844 --> 14:42.019
That man
is so selfish.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.228
I think you're being
a little selfish too, Louise.

14:44.366 --> 14:45.608
Tom!
I mean it.

14:45.746 --> 14:47.541
The real reason
you don't want George to fly

14:47.679 --> 14:49.336
is because it will upset you.

14:49.474 --> 14:51.028
George needs a hobby.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.238
The graveyards are
full of guys who didn't
know how to relax.

14:54.376 --> 14:57.482
They are also full of guys
who didn't know how to fly.

14:59.346 --> 15:01.072
George ought to consider
Louise's feelings.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.764
It's cruel to
make her worry like this.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.974
Well, it may be cruel
to stop George.

15:06.112 --> 15:08.769
The man's obviously
dying to fly.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.393
Oh, I think it's
a wonderful ambition.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.464
He wants to fly.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.294
Well, who does
he think he is,

15:16.432 --> 15:17.986
a black Mary Poppins?

15:20.367 --> 15:23.336
He's a husband
and he's got certain
responsibilities.

15:23.474 --> 15:25.717
Now, it's one thing to risk
your life when you're single

15:25.855 --> 15:28.375
but when you're married,
you're making a decision
for two.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.791
Well, that works both ways.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
One, does he have
the right to do something?

15:33.070 --> 15:34.830
Two, does she have
the right to stop him?

15:34.968 --> 15:38.351
One of our authors was
talking to me about this
only last week.

15:38.489 --> 15:42.251
He calls it the Marital
Infringement Zone Theory,

15:42.389 --> 15:43.804
MIZT.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.669
I call it B-U-L-L.

15:48.878 --> 15:51.295
No, Helen.
Tom may be right.

15:51.433 --> 15:54.367
George is just my husband.
I don't own him.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.231
Exactly. The same way
Helen doesn't own me.

15:57.439 --> 15:58.923
And I don't own her either.

16:00.338 --> 16:02.306
I mean it works
both ways, Helen.

16:03.238 --> 16:04.756
That's all I was
trying to say.

16:06.482 --> 16:08.588
If I stand in
George's way on this,

16:08.726 --> 16:10.693
he'll resent it
for the rest of his life.

16:10.831 --> 16:14.042
Which won't be for long
if he flies like he drives.

16:16.182 --> 16:19.357
Don't worry, Louise.
Flying's a great hobby.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.325
It could make George
a changed man.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.568
In that case,
I'm all for it.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.091
Oh, George,
you all right?

16:29.229 --> 16:30.299
Of course
I'm all right.

16:30.437 --> 16:31.852
What are you two
doing here?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.509
Just visiting, Snoopy.

16:39.274 --> 16:41.759
Tom and Helen just came down
to keep me company

16:41.897 --> 16:43.726
while you were
out at the airfield.

16:43.864 --> 16:45.797
Yes. How did
the lesson go, George?

16:45.935 --> 16:47.558
Uh, fine, fine.

16:47.696 --> 16:48.800
When do you go up again?

16:48.938 --> 16:50.526
Weezy, I wanna
talk to you about that.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.666
Ahem. I've been doing
a lot of thinking about this,

16:52.804 --> 16:53.978
like you were saying,

16:54.116 --> 16:55.635
about me flying up
in the plane all the time

16:55.773 --> 16:56.946
'cause you'd be
worried about me...

16:57.085 --> 16:58.707
Oh, I was wrong, George.

16:58.845 --> 17:00.157
I want you to fly.

17:00.605 --> 17:01.744
Say what?

17:02.849 --> 17:05.265
I want you to keep
taking flying lessons.

17:05.403 --> 17:06.749
You do?

17:06.887 --> 17:08.682
Tom and Helen convinced me.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.132
They did, huh?

17:10.270 --> 17:11.685
Why don't they mind
their own business?

17:12.893 --> 17:14.309
Just trying to be
a help, old buddy.

17:14.447 --> 17:16.483
Thanks, old buddy.

17:16.621 --> 17:18.416
After all,
it's your decision

17:18.554 --> 17:20.039
and I know there's
nothing I can say

17:20.177 --> 17:21.488
to make you
change your mind.

17:21.626 --> 17:22.800
There ain't, huh?

17:22.938 --> 17:26.597
And I want you to know
I'm behind you all the way.

17:28.323 --> 17:30.877
Now, George, tell me,
how did it feel up there?

17:31.015 --> 17:34.674
How did it feel?
Well, it was okay.

17:34.812 --> 17:38.298
Okay? Oh, come on, George.
I bet it was terrific, huh?

17:38.436 --> 17:41.267
Yeah, well...
Yeah, it was terrific.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.338
Especially that
accelerating moment

17:43.476 --> 17:44.580
when you pierce
through the clouds

17:44.718 --> 17:46.099
and you're looking down
on the birds.

17:46.237 --> 17:47.445
Did you see our building?

17:47.583 --> 17:49.620
Oh, you can see all
the buildings from up there.

17:49.758 --> 17:50.897
Did you learn to
work the radio?

17:51.035 --> 17:52.036
The radio? Oh, yeah.

17:52.174 --> 17:54.349
We was listening
to the VHF, the UHF,

17:54.487 --> 17:56.420
the RAF,
all that stuff.

17:57.283 --> 17:59.250
How high were you flying?
Huh?

17:59.388 --> 18:00.562
How high were you flying?

18:00.700 --> 18:01.977
I don't know how high
I was flying

18:02.115 --> 18:03.496
but I'll tell you
one thing,

18:03.634 --> 18:05.222
Yankee Stadium looked
like a cereal bowl.

18:06.602 --> 18:08.915
And the Statue of Liberty
looked like a car
hood ornament.

18:10.675 --> 18:12.401
That's sounds
marvelous.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.438
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

18:17.751 --> 18:19.719
In fact, you make it
sound so exciting,

18:19.857 --> 18:21.376
I think I'd like
to try it too.

18:21.514 --> 18:22.618
Try what?

18:22.756 --> 18:24.033
I'd like
to go up.

18:24.172 --> 18:25.414
Girl,
you're crazy.

18:25.552 --> 18:26.864
Yeah, she's right,
Weezy.

18:27.002 --> 18:29.004
I mean, look, flying ain't
all fun and games, you know.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.420
I mean, you got to
keep one eye on the
instrument panel,

18:31.558 --> 18:33.595
one eye on the clouds,
one eye on the heavy traffic.

18:33.733 --> 18:35.838
What happens
if you've only got two eyes?

18:38.772 --> 18:40.360
I still like to try it.

18:40.498 --> 18:41.879
Why don't you and
Tom come with us?

18:42.017 --> 18:43.294
Wait a minute.
Hold it, Weezy.

18:43.432 --> 18:44.813
Look, the instructor's plane
is only a two-seater.

18:44.951 --> 18:46.746
Well, we could all watch
you take your lesson,

18:46.884 --> 18:48.989
then each of us
can go up for a ride.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.164
Oh, I don't
think so, Louise.

18:51.302 --> 18:53.235
I thought you said
you'd love to fly.

18:53.373 --> 18:54.478
Oh, I do,

18:54.616 --> 18:57.101
as long as I'm
in a big plane
with a tall drink

18:57.239 --> 18:58.930
and I have a short walk
to the john.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.520
I can understand
how he feels.

19:02.658 --> 19:04.626
Some us have got guts
and some of us don't.

19:05.523 --> 19:06.973
Tom's got guts.

19:07.111 --> 19:09.700
It's just that he wants to
keep them where they belong.

19:11.288 --> 19:12.427
Oh, Helen,
please.

19:14.498 --> 19:16.845
The more I think about it,
the more I think

19:16.983 --> 19:18.847
a wife should share
her husband's hobbies.

19:18.985 --> 19:20.642
When is your next lesson,
George?

19:21.608 --> 19:23.438
Well, I'm supposed to
go tomorrow, but...

19:23.576 --> 19:25.957
Perfect!
I'm coming with you.

19:26.095 --> 19:27.442
All the way, George.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.556
Oh, there he goes.

19:38.694 --> 19:40.800
Yeah.

19:40.938 --> 19:44.321
Oh, thanks for
coming out today and
keeping me company.

19:44.459 --> 19:45.770
My pleasure.

19:45.908 --> 19:47.876
I wanted to see
for myself if George
was the hotshot pilot

19:48.014 --> 19:50.292
he kept bragging about.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.329
Girl, you know, he's got
more guts than I thought.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.503
Oh, I don't think you have
to be all that brave.

19:54.641 --> 19:56.195
You heard Mr. Stratton.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.438
The most dangerous
part of flying

19:58.576 --> 20:00.751
is the taxi ride
out to the airport.

20:00.889 --> 20:02.477
He's right.
I'm still shaking.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.307
Can I help you,
ladies?

20:05.445 --> 20:06.377
No, thank you.

20:06.515 --> 20:07.723
We're waiting
for my husband.

20:07.861 --> 20:09.553
He's learning
how to fly.

20:09.691 --> 20:11.658
Gee, I hope his arms
don't get tired.

20:15.593 --> 20:16.870
That's an old joke.

20:17.354 --> 20:18.838
I know.

20:18.976 --> 20:21.530
My name's Jack.
I'm the head mechanic.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.740
Get it?
Head...mechanic.

20:27.812 --> 20:28.917
Hi, Jack.

20:29.055 --> 20:32.023
Oh, "hijack"? Don't say
that word around here.

20:32.852 --> 20:33.991
Oh, no.

20:34.129 --> 20:36.442
So your old man's
taking flying lessons, huh?

20:36.580 --> 20:38.685
Yes. This is his
second time up.

20:38.823 --> 20:41.688
Well, I can tell that
you're worried about him,

20:41.826 --> 20:42.862
but you shouldn't be.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.415
This flight school
is one of the best.

20:44.553 --> 20:46.521
Oh, she's not worried
about him at all.

20:46.659 --> 20:48.419
In fact, the instructor's
taking her up

20:48.557 --> 20:49.869
as soon as her
husband gets down.

20:50.007 --> 20:51.008
He is?

20:51.146 --> 20:53.079
Yes. And I can
hardly wait.

20:55.944 --> 20:57.083
Good for you!

20:57.221 --> 20:59.327
And remember, as long as
I work on the planes,

20:59.465 --> 21:01.121
nothing's gonna
go wrong with them.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.985
Oh, well,
that's good to hear.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.367
And even if something
should go wrong
while you're up there,

21:05.505 --> 21:08.197
you just get on your radio
and give me a call.

21:09.026 --> 21:10.338
What good would
that do me?

21:10.476 --> 21:11.718
I'd call an ambulance.

21:14.652 --> 21:17.276
Before I get hysterical,
I'd better go to
the ladies room.

21:19.347 --> 21:21.038
Oh, Jack, I've been
looking for you.

21:21.176 --> 21:24.006
Grab your bucket.
You've got a little clean-up
to do on the two-seater.

21:24.144 --> 21:25.284
Oh, no.

21:25.422 --> 21:27.251
Yeah, Mr. Jefferson
had a little accident.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.152
An accident? Did something
go wrong with the plane?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.568
Oh, no, no, no, no,
Mrs. Jefferson.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.777
We just decided
to cut our flight short.

21:35.915 --> 21:36.847
Why?

21:36.985 --> 21:38.124
Something came up.

21:41.645 --> 21:42.991
Bad weather?

21:43.129 --> 21:44.924
No. Your husband's
breakfast.

21:46.235 --> 21:47.616
George got sick?

21:47.754 --> 21:50.378
But don't worry about it,
Mrs. Jefferson. He's fine now.

21:50.516 --> 21:52.449
He's outside
getting his color back.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.451
No offense.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.904
Poor George!
He must be so embarrassed.

22:00.042 --> 22:01.320
Well, he shouldn't be.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.012
A lot of my students get
airsick their first time up.

22:04.737 --> 22:05.945
What did you say?

22:06.083 --> 22:07.015
I said,
"A lot of my..."

22:07.153 --> 22:08.188
No, no, no, no, no.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.225
I mean about this
being his first time up.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.089
Didn't George go up
with you yesterday?

22:12.227 --> 22:14.747
No, no. He was going to,
but he got a little nervous.

22:14.885 --> 22:16.162
He came back
today, though.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.164
Your husband has got
a lot of guts.

22:22.617 --> 22:24.204
George!
Oh, hi, Weez.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.690
Okay, Mr. Jefferson,
when do you want to
take your next lesson?

22:26.828 --> 22:28.139
Next lesson?

22:28.277 --> 22:30.418
Oh, I want to talk to you
about that, Weezy.

22:30.556 --> 22:32.696
Oh, I understand, George.
You don't have to tell me.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.180
About these flying lessons,

22:34.836 --> 22:36.803
I just got the...

22:36.941 --> 22:38.322
Oh, I love it, Weezy.

22:38.460 --> 22:39.910
I mean, I just can't
wait to fly again!

22:40.048 --> 22:41.946
I mean, look, especially
that exhilarating moment

22:42.084 --> 22:44.604
when you just pierce
through the clouds
and everything is just...

22:44.742 --> 22:46.710
Oh, hi, Helen.
You still here?

22:46.848 --> 22:48.159
Have a good time
up there, George?

22:48.297 --> 22:50.369
Terrific. Hey, look,
Stratton, put me down

22:50.507 --> 22:52.025
for next week and
the week after that.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.269
Attaboy.
Now, hold it, George.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.271
I know how much
you enjoy flying.

22:56.409 --> 22:59.239
I can tell by looking at you
that you had a wonderful time.

22:59.964 --> 23:01.207
You can?

23:02.829 --> 23:06.039
Yeah. Mr. Stratton told me
you are a natural flyer.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.386
He did?

23:08.732 --> 23:10.112
But while you
were up there

23:10.250 --> 23:12.736
soaring through the clouds
enjoying yourself,

23:12.874 --> 23:15.601
I was down here
worrying myself sick.

23:15.739 --> 23:18.224
You were?
I didn't notice.

23:18.362 --> 23:19.846
Oh, you never
notice anything.

23:21.330 --> 23:22.642
Go on, Weezy.

23:22.780 --> 23:26.059
But, George, either
you give up flying
or you give up me.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.785
Oh, no!

23:27.923 --> 23:28.959
Now, I mean it,
George.

23:29.097 --> 23:31.099
What's it gonna be,
flying or me?

23:32.065 --> 23:34.205
Well...

23:34.343 --> 23:36.829
If it means that much to you,
Weezy, I got no choice.

23:36.967 --> 23:40.280
Oh, thank you, George.
You are wonderful.

23:41.074 --> 23:42.421
I know, Weezy,
I know.

23:43.594 --> 23:46.597
Stratton,
I'm giving up flying.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.255
I mean, it's heartbreaking.
It's been great.

23:50.256 --> 23:51.464
But I think
it's about time

23:51.602 --> 23:52.983
the Black Baron
hung up his wing.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.366
Over and out.

24:00.853 --> 24:02.648
Even though you love
flying so much,

24:02.786 --> 24:04.650
you're giving it up
for Louise.

24:04.788 --> 24:07.929
Oh, George,
I really misjudged you.

24:08.067 --> 24:10.103
That's because
you don't know me, Helen.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.381
I don't have a selfish bone
in my body.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.349
I mean, if I'd crashed,
I'd never forgive myself.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.419
Huh?

24:15.557 --> 24:16.731
Where in the world
could Weezy

24:16.869 --> 24:18.215
find anybody else
like me?

24:20.700 --> 24:23.358
And where in the world could
I find anybody else like her?

24:25.222 --> 24:26.223
Oh.

24:49.453 --> 24:53.043
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
