00:02.320 --> 00:04.423
<i>They say you can't choose your family.</i>

00:04.649 --> 00:06.919
<i>Well, that's probably best...</i>

00:06.920 --> 00:09.766
<i>if you could, the return policy would have to be really strict.</i>

00:09.767 --> 00:11.484
Okay, what you think?

00:11.932 --> 00:15.020
What don't you just... get yourself a dog you could dress up?

00:15.361 --> 00:18.335
Put back if you don't like it. I'll give it for you for Christmas.

00:18.503 --> 00:20.047
Thank you.

00:21.311 --> 00:24.727
Oh my God.
Stop, what are you doing?

00:24.728 --> 00:28.041
I like it! It hides the flaws in your bone structure.

00:28.869 --> 00:30.529
Mother I was looking for a foundation.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.445
Not trying to join the witness relocation program.

00:33.735 --> 00:37.185
Can you just try not to control like every aspect of my being.

00:37.186 --> 00:39.576
I'm sorry, excuse me for caring.

00:39.577 --> 00:42.308
Let's go look for some of those cute plastic clock.

00:42.728 --> 00:44.744
Regina?
Amy.

00:44.915 --> 00:46.579
I wasn't sure if it was you.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.744
There it is. You still in Portland?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.363
Still there. You still in Long Land Valley?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.248
Well, bye.
Bye.

00:56.452 --> 00:58.770
Bye Samantha.
Bye.

00:59.391 --> 01:01.735
Who is that?
That's my sister.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.835
Oh that's cute.

01:05.111 --> 01:06.511
I have an aunt?

01:06.682 --> 01:09.035
What do you mean you forgot?
It happens!

01:09.036 --> 01:10.735
You forgot way more than I have.

01:10.736 --> 01:13.775
Okay, you know what? I let it go when you forgot

01:13.776 --> 01:17.622
that I was allergic to walnuts, 'cause you know,
it was nice to see everybody at the hospital again.

01:17.623 --> 01:19.936
But you did not forget to tell me you had a sister.

01:19.937 --> 01:22.203
Because she's a horrible person, you better off not knowing her.

01:22.204 --> 01:25.926
Mom, listen... for the past year and a
half, I've been trying to put together

01:25.927 --> 01:30.270
this possible of who I am. And... an aunt is a pretty big piece!

01:31.345 --> 01:34.297
When you were two years old, you ate a piece of my puzzle.

01:34.298 --> 01:38.589
Victoria Falls, but I knew what Victoria Falls
looked like because it was a picture on a box.

01:38.590 --> 01:41.023
I'm your box.
But this is my family.

01:41.024 --> 01:43.767
Why do you not want me to know my family?

01:43.768 --> 01:45.538
The same reason I don't want you to have a gun.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.315
You might hurt yourself.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.902
Okay, but...
You are not seeing her again.

01:49.903 --> 01:51.713
The subject is closed.

01:51.957 --> 01:54.224
This was a fun day, we should have start earlier.

01:54.225 --> 01:55.689
Kisses.
Yeah but mom...

01:55.690 --> 01:58.066
I said "kisses".
Okay.

01:58.622 --> 02:01.343
See ya. I'm gonna go back to the city.

02:05.694 --> 02:07.239
Aunt Amy.

02:09.258 --> 02:10.850
Hi.

Samantha Who S02 E16</font>

02:24.846 --> 02:26.824
I win it.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.066
Wow, who ordered the sea monster?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.763
This is a deep sea delicacy I first had in Tokyo.

02:33.764 --> 02:36.319
It's never on the menu but I always ask for it.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.723
It honors the chef skills at removing the poison sac.

02:42.354 --> 02:46.479
I don't know if it is the best month, but I am going to find out if they have live starfish

02:49.538 --> 02:52.213
To our new mom!
I know! Isn't she fantastic?

02:52.214 --> 02:55.216
She lived in Tokyo. The one in Japan.

02:55.636 --> 02:58.479
It's like she's the mom I'm supposed to have you know.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.050
And there was just some crazy mix-up at
the hospital and I ended up with Regina.

03:02.252 --> 03:04.727
Who is very nice by the way. And I hope we'll keep in touch.

03:04.728 --> 03:07.030
So how are you going to tell your fist mom about this?

03:07.031 --> 03:11.163
Well, I am an adult, and I'm gonna do what adults do and...

03:11.164 --> 03:13.377
I am going to keep it a secret!

03:14.196 --> 03:16.485
So, please join me on pushing down my fears.

03:16.486 --> 03:19.990
No, I'm going to see an other one of Tony's
games so I don't want to be puffy.

03:20.697 --> 03:23.120
He doesn't care what you look like, he is gay.

03:23.121 --> 03:25.604
He is so gay!
Yes, but

03:25.605 --> 03:27.614
I may be on Jimbotron.

03:27.801 --> 03:29.920
Wooh, the Jimbotron.

03:30.091 --> 03:33.275
What is that? Like a robot, an elephant or something?

03:33.663 --> 03:38.608
No, it's the big screen. And my seat is like 3 feet away from the court.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.667
I don't even have to bring my own wine, in fact they told me to stop.

03:41.668 --> 03:45.446
Hey we should watch, I've never
seen somebody I know on national TV.

03:45.447 --> 03:47.713
Except for my high school boyfriend on the news.

03:47.714 --> 03:50.236
After the police dug up his yard.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074

04:01.047 --> 04:03.310
Sorry Sam's late.
It's ok.

04:03.311 --> 04:08.071
... sits down with his four fouls. That's
two games in a row he just can't get going.

04:08.839 --> 04:12.201
Oh God, there's Andrea. Oh Sam's missing it.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.430
And those buh jeerings are for Tony Dane's girlfriend Andrea Belladonna

04:17.430 --> 04:21.192
Guess the crowd decided she is a jinx on Tony's game

04:21.642 --> 04:23.043
Why doesn't she leave?

04:23.044 --> 04:25.326
Oh, she's got her outfit planned for the whole season.

04:25.327 --> 04:26.944
She's not going anywhere.

04:26.945 --> 04:31.529
She even, if they keep loosing, she'll keep going to the game.
Just to get on TV. 

04:31.530 --> 04:32.930
Yeah.

04:33.996 --> 04:35.893
Who are you calling?
A bookie.

04:40.427 --> 04:43.211
Love how you decorated it.

04:43.212 --> 04:44.806
Did you do this all by yourself?

04:45.446 --> 04:46.864
I don't know, actually.

04:46.865 --> 04:50.722
All I know, I killed the previous owner and I just moved right in.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.754
See? This is nice.

04:54.331 --> 04:56.844
This is an early Curbestin

04:56.845 --> 05:00.302
He was a Dutch potter who settled in
Pennsylvania. I collect these myself.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.113
Really? Take it.

05:02.475 --> 05:03.958
Please.
What? No!

05:03.959 --> 05:06.838
Sam, that's not why I...
Amy, seriously, I...

05:06.839 --> 05:09.335
have no connection to anything in this house, so...

05:09.768 --> 05:13.034
Well, except for this little African mask-y thing I named Dave.

05:13.035 --> 05:15.218
You can't have Dave.
Thank you.

05:15.788 --> 05:18.379
I should have complimented you and your flat screen TV.

05:23.485 --> 05:25.109
Hello?
Miss Newly.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.867
You requested I alert you if your mother enters the building.

05:27.868 --> 05:30.462
Huh, yeah Frank. I was there when I told you.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.730
Oh, she's here?!

05:32.731 --> 05:36.184
Can you just... can you stall her for just a second?
Okay, thank you.

05:36.396 --> 05:38.219
My mom's here. Stairs!

05:39.272 --> 05:41.898
Regina, to see "The Great Escape" at a dinner cruise

05:41.899 --> 05:43.695
is a one in a lifetime opportunity.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.277
If we're late...
Samantha has not answered her phone all day.

05:46.448 --> 05:49.800
What if she has been taking the pop stitch.
What if Todd finally snapped

05:51.196 --> 05:53.086
I'm sorry folks, the elevator has been acting up.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.942
The only way to keep it for getting stuck is to stop at every floor.

06:04.512 --> 06:08.606
Oh mom! And dad! What a delightful surprise.

06:08.607 --> 06:10.462
You haven't return my calls all day.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.842
Oh, right, yeah. I... I was at the park.

06:13.843 --> 06:17.442
And this darn squirrel took off with my cell phone.

06:17.823 --> 06:19.408
What kind of squirrel.

06:20.048 --> 06:21.379
I smell perfume.

06:22.118 --> 06:24.542
Oh, that... that's... that's Todd's cologne.

06:24.543 --> 06:26.857
He bathe in that stuff. It's just awful.

06:26.858 --> 06:29.565
It's Amy's.
Todd is seeing Amy?

06:29.775 --> 06:33.190
That's not okay, because he knows how I feel about her.

06:33.632 --> 06:36.991
She's been here. You've been seeing her behind my back, I knew it!

06:36.992 --> 06:39.242
You did not.
So, do you...

06:40.052 --> 06:42.095
you wear the cloths I buy you when you go out with her?

06:42.096 --> 06:44.578
Mom, please don't be ridiculous okay?

06:44.791 --> 06:47.453
Amy is fun, she's cool.

06:47.454 --> 06:49.665
And you know I'm sorry that you're so threatened by her

06:49.666 --> 06:53.012
but I'm not gonna stop seeing her, 'cause
you know what, she lets me be who I am.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.919
Where is the bowl?
What bowl?

06:56.591 --> 06:58.486
The bowl!
The bowl.

06:58.487 --> 07:00.496
Oh, no, no, Regina, not the bowl again.

07:00.497 --> 07:04.147
I'm gonna be in the car, the movie boat leaves in 15 minutes.

07:04.888 --> 07:07.576
The bowl that my mother passed on to me, that I passed on to you.

07:08.688 --> 07:12.718
Oh, Amy complimented it, and I just...
You gave it to her?!

07:12.719 --> 07:15.199
Yeah.
She always wanted that bowl.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.073
She only became friends with you so that she could get the bowl.

07:18.074 --> 07:23.272
Yeah right, and Dena is only friends with
me because, oh, she wants this clock.

07:23.273 --> 07:24.843
I warned you.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.426
But you wouldn't listen, so now I've lost a family heirloom.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.014
Technically, it's still in the family.

07:30.015 --> 07:32.007
I thought I was your family.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.605
I guess not.

07:35.584 --> 07:37.634
I will get the bowl back, okay?

07:37.806 --> 07:41.405
But you know you're wrong about this.
Amy didn't know about the bowl.

07:44.358 --> 07:47.808
Samantha, could you... bring the rolls to the table please?

07:47.809 --> 07:49.227
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.408
there might still be stuffing I prepared from recipes, see here I added...

07:59.030 --> 08:00.742
The bowl.

08:02.262 --> 08:03.745
You told me it was broken.

08:03.932 --> 08:06.918
I was tired of you coming over here rummaging through my house looking for it

08:06.919 --> 08:10.473
I wouldn't have to rummage if your house wasn't such a wreck.

08:10.474 --> 08:13.600
Oh I wanted to spend my energy taking care of my family

08:13.601 --> 08:16.362
There we go again. You got a family I don't have one

08:16.363 --> 08:18.211
When are you going to start throwing in my face...

08:20.023 --> 08:21.694
You're so immature!

08:22.847 --> 08:26.190
Why would you do this?
I'm meeting someone after dinner.

08:29.024 --> 08:31.129
And it looks like dinner's over.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.934
Oh, gosh.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.686
I don't wanna hear it Dave.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.165
I had two moms, now I have none.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.077
I'm an orphan. Which is not bad.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.824
No then you and I can go out and find other orphans

08:51.825 --> 08:54.660
And create a supportive ragtag family.

08:54.661 --> 08:58.378
Just call your mother and make up. She'll make you suffer for a while.

08:58.379 --> 09:01.641
Then it will be over. Like a slumber party.

09:01.642 --> 09:05.019
Yeah you're right. I'm gonna call her and apologize.

09:05.227 --> 09:07.864
yeah, tell her she's right.
No, that is not an option.

09:08.217 --> 09:12.760
If she knows that she was right, then she
is gonna be even more up in my business.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.893
Maybe if she got her bowl back, that would fix it but,

09:16.046 --> 09:18.185
there's no way that Amy is gonna give it up.

09:21.039 --> 09:23.199
That's tough, that's a tough one.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.250
What to do? What to do?
Dena!

09:27.449 --> 09:29.360
Oh, pop corn?
The bowl!

09:29.587 --> 09:31.987
Ok, somebody's hungry!
No!

09:31.988 --> 09:34.033
This is the bowl!
What?

09:34.034 --> 09:35.909
Yeah! Where did you get it?

09:35.910 --> 09:37.694
Potteryville 9 bucks.
I need it.

09:38.096 --> 09:40.218
My mom gets a bowl, Amy gets a bowl.

09:40.601 --> 09:43.784
Everyone goes back to hating Amy, the order is restored.

09:44.866 --> 09:48.400
Plus, if I pull this off, my mother never has to know she was right.

09:49.259 --> 09:52.035
I have change if you all you got is a ten

09:52.421 --> 09:53.934
Really?
Yes!

09:56.100 --> 09:57.515
Tony can't miss a shot tonight

09:57.516 --> 09:59.534
Why did I bet $300 on a jinx?

09:59.535 --> 10:03.192
You? I bet a thousand.
What?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.322
I have a history of gambling.

10:05.323 --> 10:07.963
I'm known to the thrill of betting a few hundreds

10:08.062 --> 10:11.621
You've destroyed me.
What's the score?

10:11.630 --> 10:14.108
Andrea. Oh no, no, no. Why aren't you at the game?

10:14.109 --> 10:18.001
Cause I want to show everyone that I'm not a jinx.
Tony is just having a little cold streek

10:18.002 --> 10:20.264
Not anymore he's not. He scored 20 in the first quarter,

10:20.299 --> 10:22.205
and just bounced one in off the referee's head.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.396
And I'm not there?
Now they are going to be sure that I am a jinx

10:26.990 --> 10:30.417
Watch me save your thousand bucks.
Actually, it's 2 thousand.

10:30.448 --> 10:33.008
Lying is also part of the addiction.

10:35.091 --> 10:37.859
Andrea, Tony can't miss tonight.

10:37.860 --> 10:41.102
Go! Get there while is hot. And all the credit will go to you.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.836
Yes. Shoot. I want to but I can't.
Why not?

10:44.837 --> 10:46.803
I've already wore these shoes to a game

10:46.945 --> 10:50.058
Go by the house, pick up another pair.

10:50.059 --> 10:52.864
It's so crazy, it just might work.

10:54.138 --> 10:58.365
You're gonna get your 2 thousand back.
It was actually 5 thousand.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.865
But making you believe it was 2 thousand was exhilarating.

11:10.601 --> 11:14.650
Mom, I brought you something.

11:20.838 --> 11:22.877
I got it back from Amy.

11:25.606 --> 11:30.402
She just... gave it back?
Yeah... I mean no, when she remembered

11:30.537 --> 11:33.740
that this was the bowl that you guys used to fight over,

11:33.741 --> 11:36.311
she was horrified.

11:36.477 --> 11:40.145
That it came between me and my mother.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.098
Guess I owe you an apology.
No!

11:47.608 --> 11:50.431
No, let's not dwell on how wrong you were.

11:50.432 --> 11:52.034
You have the bowl and...

11:52.035 --> 11:54.845
the less we speak of it to anyone the better.
Thanks.

11:59.966 --> 12:02.544
Howard, I got the bowl back.

12:04.606 --> 12:09.670
The bowl. Oh, Sammy, no you didn't
bring this bowl back into our house.

12:09.671 --> 12:13.104
Daddy, it's ok, it's over, we don't have to talk about it anymore.
No.

12:13.874 --> 12:16.876
What are you doing?
I'm going to my happy place.

12:16.877 --> 12:19.200
It's a place where I go whenever your mother's family comes up.

12:19.391 --> 12:21.854
Your happy place?
It's a lumber mill

12:22.155 --> 12:23.823
in Oregon.

12:24.156 --> 12:26.720
And I run it. I got 20 employees

12:26.721 --> 12:30.003
'casionally we do a run of four by four and two by six

12:30.004 --> 12:32.960
but really two by four is our bread and butter

12:33.785 --> 12:36.676
That sounds nice. Can I work for you sometimes?

12:36.677 --> 12:40.009
Wow, sure.
You know, I thought about it.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.010
Amy really has been the bigger person in all this.

12:44.586 --> 12:47.756
If she thinks she can show me up by returning this bowl

12:47.757 --> 12:50.977
just watch me returning it right back in her face.

12:51.925 --> 12:55.404
Ok. See you later mom.

12:55.666 --> 12:58.432
What?! No! No, no, no, wait, no! Oh my...

13:04.387 --> 13:07.823
What are you doing here?
I... completely forgot to tell you,

13:07.824 --> 13:12.298
Amy left for Canada. Hum, I was gonna call you about it, but

13:12.299 --> 13:16.226
that squirrel still has my phone. So let's...

13:17.050 --> 13:21.103
Well, we meet again.
Hey, I just wanted to welcome you back from Canada.

13:21.204 --> 13:23.773
So, see you. Let's go.
Can I have a minute?

13:26.150 --> 13:32.060
Well, I just thought I'd drop by to tell you how
kind it was of you to give back on this bowl.

13:32.164 --> 13:35.700
But I belive I am even kinder person because I am giving it back to you

13:35.706 --> 13:38.502
Well, it was very kind but I already have mother's bowl.

13:38.670 --> 13:41.715
The one your daughter's sneaking out with.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.731
Mom, I'm pregnant. You were right.

13:47.732 --> 13:49.962
Boys are only after one thing.
Samantha...

13:52.241 --> 13:55.479
Sweetie, you gave me a fake!
So?

13:55.724 --> 13:58.636
Look, they're completely identical. Look at this. Look, you know what?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.572
I switch 'em up, everybody gets a bowl.

14:00.629 --> 14:02.847
I dare you to tell them apart.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.718
That one.
No, that's mine.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.638
I changed my mind.
Enough. Stop it! Stop, give me that.

14:08.886 --> 14:12.611
You are fighting to the death for a $9 bowl.

14:12.612 --> 14:15.413
God, how did the women in this family get so screwed up?

14:15.414 --> 14:19.722
What's all this noise? It sounds like you're trying to wake the dead.

14:19.723 --> 14:22.356
Mother go back upstairs. I can handle it.

14:25.049 --> 14:27.531
I have a grandmother?

14:29.274 --> 14:31.203
Ah yes! Tony totally tanked.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.001
That's $300 for me and $5000 for you.

14:34.002 --> 14:36.057
Hey you know what? Let's go to Vegas.

14:36.058 --> 14:37.974
Right now!
Nope.

14:37.975 --> 14:39.685
I gotta buy my daughter a tree house,

14:39.686 --> 14:41.898
and locate a good rehab facility.

14:41.899 --> 14:43.868
But you have fun

14:44.291 --> 14:45.599
What?

14:46.409 --> 14:48.794
Tony, there was no such thing as a jinx.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.579
You wanna know what I think? I confuse you.

14:51.580 --> 14:54.187
You see me up in the stand, and you say

14:54.188 --> 14:56.808
"oh, she's hot, I think I want her,

14:56.895 --> 15:00.777
maybe I'm not as gay as I thought I was."

15:00.778 --> 15:04.212
Well, here's what I think. You're the only one who knows I'm gay.

15:04.213 --> 15:08.808
So I when I'm looking at the stands and I see you, 
I see someone who can take everything away from me with a phone call

15:08.905 --> 15:11.248
and that's why I can't play when you're around.

15:12.885 --> 15:15.414
Well, that's very different from what I thought.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.424
Wait, wait , wait. Tony, Tony, wait.

15:20.070 --> 15:23.257
This is me. 6th grade.

15:27.874 --> 15:29.551
That is a lot of facial hair.

15:29.552 --> 15:31.935
Girls in gym threw chew toys at me.

15:32.036 --> 15:36.302
It took years of painful electrolysis to become 
the stunning fox you see in front of you

15:36.303 --> 15:40.094
Why do you keep this?
Because whenever I see someone less fortunate

15:40.095 --> 15:45.436
I pull it out and I look at it and I realize
that I used to be less fortunate.

15:45.635 --> 15:48.156
And then I don't have to feel sorry for them.

15:48.738 --> 15:53.701
Look, no one knows about this. So you can keep it. I trust you.

15:54.245 --> 15:58.082
Just like you can trust me.
I'm just asking,

15:58.995 --> 16:02.386
can you grow this back? Two to three days

16:02.952 --> 16:06.292
I have a grandmother. How long have you known about her?

16:06.715 --> 16:09.450
Oh, I haven't seen you since you got yourself run over.

16:09.451 --> 16:11.586
I guess your mother is ashamed of me.

16:11.687 --> 16:16.060
I invited you to come and see her when she was in the coma.
Yes, it sounded like a lot of laughs

16:16.061 --> 16:20.422
Hi nana. I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.

16:20.623 --> 16:23.036
Granny, or nounou... but, hi.

16:24.831 --> 16:27.832
Hey back off jumbo. I got brittle bones.

16:27.833 --> 16:31.546
Mom, Regina's trying to take my bowl. Tell her she can't do it.
Oh for Pete's sake,

16:31.547 --> 16:36.544
I just gave it to you. I brought it back. Will you please tell her to give it to me.

16:36.545 --> 16:40.459
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I just came down here to get my cigarettes.

16:43.589 --> 16:47.796
Oh Regina, another flavorless meal.
Thank God I brought my own food.

16:48.456 --> 16:51.197
Here, mom, I'll wash your bowl so you can take it home.

16:51.398 --> 16:54.708
Uh, no, you can have it. Someone from church left it at my house.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.096
I don't need any more crap around. It's your problem now.

17:00.655 --> 17:02.847
Look what mom gave me

17:03.968 --> 17:07.568
What? Mother!

17:08.507 --> 17:11.747
Wait a minute. I remembered.

17:11.748 --> 17:16.058
This... this is not about the bowl. This bowl
doesn't mean anything. It's never meant anything.

17:16.252 --> 17:21.396
The only reason that Amy wants it
is because she gave it to you.
That's because she got everything

17:21.397 --> 17:25.169
What are you talking about? You always got
everything you want. You were the special little baby.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.559
Are you kidding Regina the Queen-a.

17:29.437 --> 17:31.183
Stop.
Stop it.

17:32.257 --> 17:37.550
I loved you both the same. I may have
only enough love for one daughter

17:37.651 --> 17:40.668
but you each got half, so what's the big deal.

17:40.869 --> 17:42.869
Well, it kind of is a big deal.

17:43.066 --> 17:47.121
Maybe if they'd gotten more love from you,
they wouldn't be fighting over this stupid bowl.

17:47.122 --> 17:52.068
Oh look, they might have only half a
mother but at least they had two daddies.

17:52.494 --> 17:53.863
What?

17:53.864 --> 17:56.717
Our daddy was my daddy. I know that.

17:56.752 --> 18:00.526
Maybe I am just saying by then there was another rooster in the hen house

18:00.527 --> 18:05.279
Oh Lord, mother, ok...
Maybe we should just stop this.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.726
Do a DNA test if you want. You can dig up your daddy, but

18:08.842 --> 18:12.141
I scattered your uncle ashes at the fair grounds

18:12.342 --> 18:17.082
What? Uncle Jack?
Now uncle Jack was a half wit, Luther.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.375
Uncle Jack never got passed third base.

18:20.596 --> 18:22.583
Luther was in a wheelchair!

18:22.584 --> 18:25.278
Please stop with the yelling again.

18:27.412 --> 18:29.339
OK I just had enough!!

18:33.964 --> 18:38.536
I'm not cleaning up that mess.
My bowl.

18:39.125 --> 18:43.359
You had no right to do that.
Yes I did. It was passed on to me.

18:43.394 --> 18:47.440
Oh God, with all this poison, all this hatred, I don't even want it.

18:47.891 --> 18:50.941
You know, I don't need a bowl to know that my mother loves me.

18:51.640 --> 18:56.663
I know my mother loves me. All she ever tried
to do is protect me from the two of you.
Oh Samantha.

18:58.919 --> 19:02.580
What's all that noise down there?
You stay out of this mother

19:02.581 --> 19:05.237
I'll come up there and unplugged you again.

19:05.494 --> 19:08.907
Let's go. You really don't want to meet this one.

19:10.652 --> 19:12.191
Geez.

19:14.275 --> 19:17.161
Okay, I don't like that family. Is there
another family that we can have?

19:17.162 --> 19:20.007
Oh this is good, now you can start from scratch.

19:21.875 --> 19:25.000
Hey, you gonna be okay to drive?
Yeah I'm fine.

19:27.530 --> 19:30.207
I left my purse in there.
Oh no.

19:31.811 --> 19:34.379
I'm trying to decide if it's worth going back in.

19:34.380 --> 19:39.304
God, those people! I should have listen to you.

19:39.391 --> 19:43.153
I was like that pretty girl on a horror
movie you keep yelling at the screen

19:43.158 --> 19:46.646
"don't go back in the house". And she
always goes back in the house.

19:48.235 --> 19:51.027
All she needs is to find out for herself

19:52.468 --> 19:55.545
And you would be pretty if you keep your hair off your face.

19:58.749 --> 20:01.521
Thank you for my fresh start mom.

20:01.974 --> 20:03.963
You're welcome.

20:05.665 --> 20:07.015
Oh, here.

20:09.804 --> 20:11.691
Where did you get this?

20:11.692 --> 20:14.219
You'd really think I was gonna
get my sister the real one, did you?

20:14.923 --> 20:19.701
I swung by a store. They're 9 bucks.
Yeah, but it's not the real bowl.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.531
what is then?

20:22.324 --> 20:24.946
So from mother to daughter,

20:26.618 --> 20:32.242
you pass it down. And you're gonna tell the story of the bowl.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.936
And that her grandmother was right.
Yes, of course.

20:38.316 --> 20:40.268
I love you mommy.

20:41.459 --> 20:43.742
<i>Ok, so no family is perfect.</i>

20:43.751 --> 20:45.392
<i>I thought I found a documentary on one,</i>

20:45.393 --> 20:47.841
<i>but it turned out to be a sitcom from the 70s.</i>

20:47.954 --> 20:50.370
<i>The point is you can't choose your family</i>

20:50.371 --> 20:52.791
<i>You're stuck with them. Good and bad.</i>

20:52.792 --> 20:55.603
<i>But that's okay. Maybe the bad relatives are there</i>

20:55.604 --> 20:57.608
<i>to help you appreciate the good ones.</i>

20:57.731 --> 21:00.011
<i>The ones who have been looking out for you all along.</i>

21:00.012 --> 21:04.938
I've got a bowl just like that one.
No Frank, not like this one.
