WEBVTT

00:23.815 --> 00:27.944
Your rescue of my brother and the Pagans
from the beach was impressive.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.868
How long did Harald remain with you
before he left for Novgorod?

00:36.536 --> 00:37.871
He never went to Jomsborg.

00:39.205 --> 00:43.543
He and Leif Eriksson parted
with Freydis shortly after we fought you.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.048
But you took Freydis to Jomsborg.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.926
Harekr installed her as our Gudija,

00:52.886 --> 00:56.056
until he became threatened
by her power and murdered her…

00:57.932 --> 00:59.184
and kept her child.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.104
Child? By Harald?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.105
A son.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.985
Harekr intends to raise him
as the next ruler of Jomsborg.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.327
I knew your father.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.205
His name was Torvil Magnusson.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.499
Torvil "the Tall."

01:25.585 --> 01:29.756
Before I converted to Christ,
we raided together in the east.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.716
He was a great Viking warrior.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.302
I don't believe you.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.763
Your mother's name is Gudrid.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.850
She was, and I'm sure still is,
a beautiful woman.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.853
She traveled with him
on those raids, carrying you.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.149
I also knew Harekr.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.904
He's nothing more than a pirate,
which is why I'm hunting him.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.448
-I thought you only hunted pagans.
-I did.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.408
But trade is my mission now.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.828
It is the future of the Viking world.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.456
And pirates like Harekr,
who prey upon other Vikings,

02:03.540 --> 02:04.541
are my enemy.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.877
I have no issues with Jomsborg.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.131
Only its leader.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.885
I find it hard to believe he would allow
a warrior like yourself to be banished.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.555
I would have sought your death.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.100
He tried, but the elders overruled him.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.437
An intervention by the gods.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.859
Why would a Christian say that?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.198
As I've grown older, Jorundr,

02:37.282 --> 02:41.202
I see more similarities
than differences in our two beliefs.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.331
I pray to my God
to find Harekr and destroy him.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.876
Your gods
clearly meant for you to survive.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.255
Our gods brought us together for a reason,

02:52.922 --> 02:55.675
so that you could take us to Jomsborg

02:55.758 --> 02:57.594
to unseat Harekr

02:58.303 --> 03:00.722
and allow you
to take your rightful position

03:00.805 --> 03:02.974
as the leader of a new Jomsborg.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.021
A divine intervention.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.717
Kaysan.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.144
How are you?

03:48.811 --> 03:49.646
I'm fine.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.607
You're a terrible liar.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.987
I did a reading this morning.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.740
We should be
near the mouth of the Dnieper.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.201
Just two days away from Constantinople.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.789
I'll have you home soon.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.096
How is she?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.058
She needs rest.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.230
And we will soon need a mast.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.944
Olaf.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.204
Fire!

04:57.380 --> 04:58.298
How did he find us?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.759
And how do they know to stay
outside the range of our sentinels?

05:01.843 --> 05:02.969
Jorundr.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.015
He would not do that.
He would not turn against his people.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.058
He does not know that Harekr is dead

05:10.435 --> 05:11.477
or that I'm alive.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.690
And he does not know Olaf.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.943
We must go out and challenge him!

05:19.027 --> 05:21.321
I say we hold them off until they go away!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.781
-We will do neither!

05:24.824 --> 05:26.367
He now knows where we are.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.162
If we attack him on the water

05:29.245 --> 05:31.664
or hold him off,
he will fall back to Kattegat

05:32.248 --> 05:35.084
and return with more men
and more ships for another attack.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.878
Then what is our plan?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.964
We are the last holdout of the old ways.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.924
Many of us are here because of him.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.762
He has robbed us
of our homes and families.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.264
And he now hunts those
who have always been here!

05:50.600 --> 05:51.517
I know him.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.646
He is driven by his God
to undertake this mission.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.523
And if we are to survive,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.569
we must remind him
there is work still to do.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.446
-You're right.
-Yeah.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.495
Jomsborg is a natural fortress.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.497
The entrance is invisible from the sea

06:12.580 --> 06:14.749
and it forces an attacking fleet

06:14.832 --> 06:16.042
to enter single file,

06:16.125 --> 06:18.711
making them easy targets
for its sentinel on the cliff.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.340
Then an attack from behind, over land?

06:22.423 --> 06:24.467
It is possible,

06:24.550 --> 06:28.930
but Harekr would see your movement
and cut you off from your ships.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.557
Then where is its weakness?

06:33.684 --> 06:34.685
The front door.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.688
If you can disable the main sentinel,

06:38.648 --> 06:39.982
it has no defense.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.694
What do you suggest?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.785
I suggest a mission
for the future leader of Jomsborg.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.149
Take them up!

07:39.208 --> 07:40.418
Coming up the east side.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.149
We've come to speak with Harekr.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.984
-Where is he?
-Harekr is dead.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.944
Killed by his people.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.864
Then who is in charge?

08:10.740 --> 08:11.574
I am.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.701
We are here to talk.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.288
-Not fight.
-You are alive.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.831
Clearly.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.752
We've allowed you to enter, Olaf.
Tell us your business.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.046
I've come for Harald's son.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.089
You mean my son.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.050
Harald is a Christian.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.888
I cannot stand the thought of his child
being raised in a pagan world.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.476
I think
that you are more worried that one day,

08:39.101 --> 08:42.146
our son will challenge yours
for the throne of Norway.

08:44.023 --> 08:48.361
If you want my child, Olaf,
you will have to kill me for him.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.501
Traitor!

09:04.585 --> 09:05.419
Mother.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.217
Don't call me that name!
You have brought shame and disgrace on me!

09:11.300 --> 09:12.426
No.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.928
Mother! Mother!

09:15.054 --> 09:16.472
I did not know.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.642
I came here to kill Harekr.
I would never have betrayed Jomsborg.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.060
Do not do it now.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.105
A message from Freydis.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.440
The harbor.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.027
Leave me! You are no son of mine!

10:14.780 --> 10:15.823
My queen.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.243
I'm making
my prenuptial Act of Contrition.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.662
Do you have time for that?

10:22.246 --> 10:23.956
I thought you had a wedding today.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.421
Princess Gytha will not take the place
of what you stole from me.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.509
But God has given me
the strength to forgive you.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.557
My father once told me that in war,

10:42.391 --> 10:45.394
it does not matter
the size of your enemy's forces,

10:45.978 --> 10:49.774
the strength of his steel
or the valor of his men.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.780
All that is required for victory

10:56.781 --> 10:59.158
is to know your enemy's deepest desire.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.369
And you would dare to know that?

11:03.079 --> 11:06.165
Aelfwynn could never
have given you a child of royal blood,

11:06.749 --> 11:07.667
but Gytha can.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.628
And you would not have gained her hand

11:10.711 --> 11:16.967
unless you were forced to lose something
of immeasurable value… by me.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.141
Once again, you've misjudged me.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.812
But God will not,

11:29.146 --> 11:31.273
and he will find you worthy of Hell.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.819
I look forward
to seeing you there, my queen.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.072
At the wedding, I mean.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.060
What is this place?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.312
The Pontic Olbia.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.442
It was a sacred place
for the ancient Greeks.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.652
They built a great temple here.

12:23.951 --> 12:27.413
Travelers stopped here for centuries
to pay their respects,

12:27.496 --> 12:30.416
especially those going to a new life.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.755
Like all of us.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.692
Is this all we have?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.612
Except for the stores at the sentinels.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.364
Collect it all. I want it brought here.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.658
All of it.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.715
Did you give it to him?

13:21.342 --> 13:22.384
Yes.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.472
I am here because I saw
this design on Jorundr's arm.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.229
I had only seen it once before
drawn in sand by The Seer.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.606
He told me to trust it.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.235
I no longer understand the fates,

13:40.110 --> 13:41.362
nor trust destinies.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.949
Vikings cannot control their fate.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.410
But we can control how we face it.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.955
Trust your son.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.965
We should attack over land.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.677
With Harekr dead,
it is the safest strategy.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.139
Jorundr, your opinion?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.100
You should leave.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.896
Go back for more men and ships.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
You know the way back.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.234
Attack when you're stronger.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.402
That is ridiculous.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.572
You saw their main ship was under repair.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.450
And the rest of their boats
are out on raids.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.120
I saw what she wanted us to see.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.622
She may have hidden the other boats.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.667
You don't understand.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.462
It is all a trap she has set for you.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.882
She is daring you to attack Jomsborg

14:43.632 --> 14:45.634
and if you do, it will be your grave.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.803
You think so?

14:48.470 --> 14:49.305
Yes.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.349
I think it is you
who don't want us to attack.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.644
It's understandable
to feel guilty for your decision.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.146
Guilty?

15:01.942 --> 15:05.446
I tried to help Freydis
and this is what it cost me.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.824
Did anyone in Jomsborg
stop to help me? Hmm?

15:08.908 --> 15:09.783
No.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.037
You asked for my opinion.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.247
I gave it.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.460
I am not leaving.

15:20.878 --> 15:25.591
God has brought me here for a reason
and I will not back down from my destiny.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.809
Then you must take out this sentinel.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.484
And we start running
as fast as we can…

15:43.567 --> 15:45.569
But I did not see the ball and…

15:45.653 --> 15:47.571
I go falling on my face!

16:02.086 --> 16:03.337
I love you.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.257
I am sorry.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.678
It is finally my time.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.665
I miss you already.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.549
Mariam…

16:50.926 --> 16:53.929
I will bring
your message of love to Orlaith.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.472
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.397
You have a difficult road ahead.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.111
Help me, please.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.197
I cannot advise you.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.119
But your heart will.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.184
Take care of him for me.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.936
You know I will.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.105
Amen.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.464
Thanks.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.508
Congratulations.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.977
A married lady now.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.229
Thank you, my queen.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.523
I have something for you.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.745
Godwin, congratulations.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.831
Queen Emma, it is beautiful.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.252
It has a very special meaning to me.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.172
And I wish you to wear it always.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.804
-Blessings upon you.
-Thank you.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.021
You are now part of my family.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.733
I have great expectations
of your children.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.986
-And I shall try my best, Your Highness.
-Oh, I know you will.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.281
Because they will be half Viking.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.919
I hope you have found a way

20:54.002 --> 20:56.546
to put your suspicions of Godwin
behind you.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.012
I have.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.267
Good.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.150
Be happy for me.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.656
This is a beautiful place to die.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.910
I promised that I'd bring you home,

21:28.453 --> 21:29.496
but I couldn't.

21:35.752 --> 21:39.923
You have great places
yet to go, Leif Eriksson,

21:41.049 --> 21:43.302
and still much to learn.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.557
So I have one more thing

21:49.474 --> 21:51.018
to share with you.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.481
When you get to Constantinople,

21:57.024 --> 21:59.234
find the Gate of the Lion.

22:00.110 --> 22:04.364
On the other side of it,
beside the Tower of Belisarius…

22:05.741 --> 22:06.992
is my little house.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.081
It is yours.

22:14.708 --> 22:20.964
There is much inside
that will help you on your journey.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.344
Use what you learn there wisely.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.521
Now tell me once again

22:38.857 --> 22:42.402
about the söngr of the Hvalr

22:42.486 --> 22:46.865
that swims
to the very bottom of the world.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.578
And then, all at once…

22:54.122 --> 22:57.125
-…he explodes from the darkness…

22:59.211 --> 23:02.297
mouth open wide enough
to swallow a whole ship…

23:05.550 --> 23:06.426
and suddenly,

23:07.928 --> 23:12.432
enters our world for just a moment…

23:17.771 --> 23:19.106
…taking it all in…

23:24.820 --> 23:27.072
before disappearing once again…

23:29.699 --> 23:30.742
into the deep.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.511
I noticed the queen
gave you a present tonight.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.764
Yes, a gift she said would please you.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.641
Only you can make me happy.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.276
I hope to.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.515
Did you forget that you married a Viking?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.187
I married a beautiful woman.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.662
What is it?

24:59.456 --> 25:00.790
That's the queen's gift?

25:01.750 --> 25:02.584
Yes.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.377
Isn't it beautiful?

25:06.546 --> 25:09.299
She told me
that every time you looked at it,

25:09.382 --> 25:11.051
it would remind you of your past,

25:11.676 --> 25:14.095
and those you loved and lost.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.890
She said that she took it from a bear.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.518
Though I do not think that part is true.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.479
Take it off.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.813
I cannot.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.275
She made me promise to wear it always.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.071
Is that not like Queen Emma?

25:32.697 --> 25:33.532
Yes.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.577
It's exactly like her.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.344
From the Earth,

26:37.304 --> 26:38.346
we created you.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.892
And to it, we shall return you.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.561
And from it,

26:47.564 --> 26:49.316
we shall bring you forth once more.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.392
Hard to believe
we are almost at Constantinople.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.062
I'm in no hurry.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.939
I know the feeling.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.192
I set out on this journey to buy an army

27:33.610 --> 27:35.195
and return to Norway a king.

27:37.781 --> 27:38.657
Now,

27:40.033 --> 27:43.161
I find myself even further away
from that goal than when I started.

27:44.871 --> 27:48.166
Perhaps, however,
you are closer to something even greater.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.710
You helped deliver my father's treasure.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.837
And it is so prized by the emperor

27:54.130 --> 27:56.299
that he will reward you
beyond your wildest dreams.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.635
Then why are you
not in a hurry to deliver it?

27:59.594 --> 28:01.596
And be free of your responsibility?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.224
Because I'm not sure
what will happen afterwards.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.811
That means you will be free.

28:09.979 --> 28:10.897
Free to choose.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.661
Allfather and Valkyries,

28:24.744 --> 28:26.371
look upon me with favorable eyes

28:27.789 --> 28:30.458
and give me victory.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.754
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,

28:34.838 --> 28:36.631
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

28:37.549 --> 28:39.134
in Heaven as on Earth.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.219
Allfather and Valkyries,

28:43.388 --> 28:45.140
look upon me with favorable eyes

28:46.516 --> 28:49.018
and give me victory.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.895
And lead us not into temptation,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.565
but deliver us from evil.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.109
Amen.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.500
No matter what happens to me,

29:13.376 --> 29:16.755
you must not allow Olaf to take him,
do you understand?

29:18.506 --> 29:21.885
And if I am dead
and someone asks you about my child,

29:22.969 --> 29:26.139
you will tell them
that he is the son of Harald Sigurdsson,

29:27.474 --> 29:29.184
the grandson of Erik the Red

29:29.267 --> 29:32.187
and the nephew of Leif Eriksson.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.898
And his mother is Freydis.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.108
The Keeper of the Faith.

30:50.974 --> 30:51.808
This way.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.952
-Remember the signal.
-Hmm.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.038
Now.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.306
Pagan filth! Traitor!

32:03.463 --> 32:04.672
Jorundr!

32:04.756 --> 32:05.924
Signal the boats.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.217
-Why?
-Do it.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.345
Go.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.190
There. They've taken the sentinel.

32:24.943 --> 32:25.777
Row.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.695
Oars! Row!

32:42.251 --> 32:44.879
Tell my mother…

32:47.173 --> 32:48.383
I'm not a traitor.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.075
Get ready!

33:40.893 --> 33:42.687
Where are her people?

33:43.813 --> 33:45.023
Who is she waiting for?

33:46.190 --> 33:47.025
Me.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.200
I have come for him, Freydis.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.091
So this is how you fight one-on-one,

34:12.175 --> 34:13.676
with your entire fleet?

34:14.677 --> 34:17.638
I just wanted my men
to have a good seat for the fight.

34:22.477 --> 34:26.272
It is not every day they get to see
the great Olaf Haraldsson

34:26.355 --> 34:27.565
beaten by a woman.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.744
Is that Canute's son?

34:39.827 --> 34:43.456
Yes, the King of Norway, Svein.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.043
King of Norway.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.839
Why don't you come here
where you can see better?

35:05.394 --> 35:07.271
What does it say on your sword?

35:07.355 --> 35:09.315
It says "The Keeper of the Faith."

35:10.149 --> 35:13.569
It is my destiny
to protect those who worship the Old Gods.

35:15.738 --> 35:19.408
And it is my destiny
to do away with those ancient myths.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.912
I should have finished you
in the Great Hall

35:22.995 --> 35:24.247
when you murdered Gunnar.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.374
I gave you a chance.

35:27.291 --> 35:31.003
-But you did not take it.
-Well, I'm here now, Freydis.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.589
But before I kill you,

35:34.215 --> 35:36.467
I will offer you one last chance

35:37.301 --> 35:39.971
to receive the holy baptism of Christ

35:40.054 --> 35:42.598
and the promise of eternal life.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.395
Redemption.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.273
Eternal life.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.945
Eternal life.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.117
And are all these men baptized?

36:02.577 --> 36:03.661
They are.

36:04.954 --> 36:05.997
Each and every one.

36:08.124 --> 36:08.958
Good.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.087
Then I feel better about this.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.057
Go!

36:26.058 --> 36:27.435
Svein!

36:42.909 --> 36:43.868
Freydis!

36:49.916 --> 36:52.251
Get out! Stay away!

36:52.335 --> 36:54.503
Now it is your turn, Olaf.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.720
You may think you have killed me, Freydis,

38:26.971 --> 38:28.514
but you've done the opposite.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.434
You've made me a martyr

38:32.184 --> 38:34.312
whose name will be remembered

38:35.980 --> 38:38.441
long after yours has been forgotten.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.737
But who is left to tell your story?

39:11.432 --> 39:14.226
No! Please.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.025
Spare me, please. Please.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.490
Get up, King of Norway.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.524
Which one of you
is Harald Sigurdsson of Norway?

40:01.607 --> 40:02.483
I'm Harald.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.986
The Emperor Romanos

40:06.070 --> 40:08.697
has travelled
from Constantinople to greet you.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.835
We heard rumors
that a mighty band of Vikings

40:20.918 --> 40:23.754
had made it past the Pechenegs
with a group of women.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.423
They're not rumors.

40:25.506 --> 40:26.507
The Khan is dead.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.511
That is an accomplishment

40:30.594 --> 40:33.347
that few could imagine
and even fewer claim.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.225
Did Your Highness
come all this way just to thank us?

40:36.851 --> 40:38.769
No, I came to see

40:38.853 --> 40:41.397
if you brought the treasure
from Vitomir of Chude.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.442
Vitomir did not survive the journey,

40:44.525 --> 40:45.985
but his daughter, Elena, did.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.362
I believe she has the object you desire.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.613
Yes, I know.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.575
We have already
confirmed its authenticity.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.142
You are every bit as beautiful
as your father described.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.107
Welcome to your new life.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.612
New life?

41:30.905 --> 41:33.657
You did not know
what it was you were delivering?

41:33.741 --> 41:35.576
I thought it was the medallion.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.203
No.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.288
It was my bride.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.625
The new Empress of Constantinople.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.381
All of you,

41:50.257 --> 41:53.219
a hero's welcome
awaits you in Constantinople,

41:53.302 --> 41:55.638
and reward for your bravery.

41:55.721 --> 41:58.224
And you, Harald Sigurdsson,

41:59.266 --> 42:00.518
I am in your debt.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.938
Ask me for anything and I will provide it.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.525
-Anything?
-Anything.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.030
I will find a price.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.325
Good.

42:17.535 --> 42:22.248
A man of your skills
would be of great service to me.

42:27.586 --> 42:29.964
-Give them whatever they want.
-Yes, sire.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.133
You could have told me.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.636
And had you known,
what would you have counseled me to do?

42:36.595 --> 42:38.013
Not identify yourself.

42:39.056 --> 42:42.268
And we would have both arrived
in Constantinople empty-handed.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.521
Now you have the favor
of the emperor himself.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.525
And you're his empress, out of my reach.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.698
Nothing is out of your reach.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.539
Who is this?

43:50.502 --> 43:51.420
Svein!

44:04.141 --> 44:05.017
Where is Olaf?

44:06.310 --> 44:08.187
-How did you get here?

44:13.317 --> 44:14.485
You must be Freydis.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.573
I have returned your son
when I did not need to.

44:20.157 --> 44:21.158
I thank you.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.912
What do you require
for this act of kindness?

44:27.039 --> 44:27.915
Peace.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.381
You have my word.

44:36.965 --> 44:38.509
Mother to mother.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.811
<i>I am within my right</i>
<i>to take revenge.</i>

44:48.894 --> 44:50.312
<i>I believe her!</i>

44:50.396 --> 44:52.815
-<i>A trial by combat.</i>
-With me?

44:52.898 --> 44:54.817
<i>Hundreds? More like thousands.</i>

44:54.900 --> 44:57.444
<i>The cross that carries the sword</i>
<i>was never you.</i>

44:57.528 --> 44:59.405
<i>If we die, so do our Gods.</i>

44:59.488 --> 45:02.700
<i>Without the Greenlanders,</i>
<i>London bridge would still be standing,</i>

45:02.783 --> 45:04.118
<i>but we would not.</i>

45:30.894 --> 45:33.814
You are Freydis, aren't you?

45:35.274 --> 45:36.775
The Keeper of the Faith?

45:39.319 --> 45:40.320
Yes.

45:41.613 --> 45:42.614
I am.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.082
Look.
