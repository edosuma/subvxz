00:01.417 --> 00:02.458
(J.D.)
<i>Let's face it,</i>

00:02.542 --> 00:05.875
<i>most days start like</i>
<i>any other, but some days...</i>

00:05.959 --> 00:08.291
Well?

00:08.375 --> 00:09.417
It's beautiful...

00:09.500 --> 00:12.000
But my parents will kill me
if I marry a black guy.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.917
(laughs)

00:14.000 --> 00:15.166
So you gonna ask Carla?

00:15.250 --> 00:18.291
-I'm doin' it.
-Okay, ready?

00:18.375 --> 00:19.667
-You sure?
-Positive.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.834
(both laughing)

00:21.917 --> 00:24.041
Congratulations!
So when are you gonna ask her?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.667
Tonight. I'm gonna
make her a nice dinner,

00:25.750 --> 00:27.834
and then I'm gonna put the ring
in her champagne glass.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.208
You might as well put it
in her cham-lame glass.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.750
Okay, Mr. Know-it-all,
what would you do?

00:31.834 --> 00:33.625
Okay, first you gotta get,
like, 50 candles, right?

00:33.709 --> 00:36.291
You spread 'em all over the room
with some rose petals.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.709
That's right,
because the roses are beautiful,

00:38.792 --> 00:40.583
and they make the room smell
amazing.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.125
-Like a meadow in springtime.
-Mmm...

00:43.208 --> 00:44.208
What are you guys talkin' about?

00:44.291 --> 00:46.834
-Nothing. Guy talk.
-Yeah, bitches and hoes.

00:48.542 --> 00:49.792
Come on, hurry up.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.333
I just have to
get changed.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.041
Have you two met?

00:56.125 --> 00:58.166
Todd, you're
overcompensating,

00:58.250 --> 01:00.333
you're gay, and you need
to be ok with it.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.166
Oh, yeah?
If I'm gay,

01:02.250 --> 01:03.834
how come I work out
so much?

01:06.250 --> 01:09.417
(J.D.) <i>It's tough to be a woman</i>
<i>in a co-ed locker room.</i>

01:13.000 --> 01:15.166
(murmuring)

01:15.250 --> 01:18.000
(booing and calling out)

01:18.083 --> 01:20.417
Dance! They want
you to dance.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.709
(burlesque music plays)

01:22.792 --> 01:24.458
(clapping)

01:30.959 --> 01:33.000
Whoo!

01:42.917 --> 01:45.041
(all clapping)

01:51.166 --> 01:53.375
Um... Maybe I should just
change in the bathroom.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.542
-Honey?
-Hmm?

01:57.625 --> 01:59.166
Do you want
some champagne?

01:59.250 --> 02:01.417
Actually, I'm just gonna
stay with coffee.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.166
Okay.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.542
Coffee it is...

02:05.625 --> 02:06.709
For my baby!

02:06.792 --> 02:09.750
Oh, what the hell,
I'll have some champagne.

02:10.875 --> 02:11.959
Okay.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.625
Hot!

02:16.709 --> 02:17.875
Are you ok?
(blowing)

02:17.959 --> 02:20.500
(snorts and laughs)

02:20.583 --> 02:22.375
I'm absolutely fine,
honey...

02:22.458 --> 02:23.959
because I am
here with you.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.792
(telephone rings)

02:25.875 --> 02:27.667
Hello?

02:27.750 --> 02:28.834
<i>Mami...</i>

02:28.917 --> 02:32.458
Why are you
calling so late? Uh-huh...

02:32.542 --> 02:34.458
Uh-huh...

02:34.542 --> 02:36.000
She's dead?

02:37.500 --> 02:38.500
Yeah, yeah! I--

02:38.583 --> 02:40.333
I'll be right over.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.291
My Aunt Marie's dead!

02:44.250 --> 02:45.792
She's only 60.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.417
To one hell of a lady!

02:49.500 --> 02:50.875
Huh? (clinks)

02:50.959 --> 02:52.458
What?

02:54.417 --> 02:56.333
You should be
with your mom right now.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.750
Yeah--thank you, baby.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.417
Stay out of trouble.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.250
(squeakily) Mmm.

I've to fly out late
for the funeral tonight,

03:28.667 --> 03:30.333
and I'm gonna need your help
covering my shifts.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.083
Anything for you,
honey.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.208
Thanks, Mama.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.417
Hey, Laverne, can I borrow a
nickel so I can get a soda?

03:36.500 --> 03:39.166
Sorry,
this window's closed.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.333
By the way,
Elaine's back.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.333
(J.D.) <i>Elaine's been on top of</i>
<i>the heart-transplant list</i>

03:43.417 --> 03:46.250
<i>so long she's in and out of this</i>
<i>hospital almost as much as I am.</i>

03:46.333 --> 03:48.083
Hey, home-slice,
we talked about this.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.792
You don't get into bed
until I come in

03:49.875 --> 03:51.250
so I can see your boot-ay.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.125
If I finally get
a damn heart,

03:53.208 --> 03:55.083
I'll let you eat
ice cream off it.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.834
You are naughty!

03:56.917 --> 03:58.917
Ohh, you know,
it always feels so weird

03:59.000 --> 04:01.166
to be sitting around
hoping someone's family

04:01.250 --> 04:02.750
pulls them off
life support.

04:02.834 --> 04:05.542
I honestly believe
in hospitals...

04:06.375 --> 04:10.208
There's, like,
this balance, you know?

04:10.291 --> 04:12.583
And it's, like,
when one person dies,

04:12.667 --> 04:15.583
another person gets
a chance to live.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.500
I like to call it
the circle of life.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.417
Oh, my God,

04:20.500 --> 04:23.083
you must stop watching
<i>The Lion King.</i>

04:23.875 --> 04:25.625
I like
that baby lion cub.

04:25.959 --> 04:28.250
-What's his name?
-Simba.

04:28.333 --> 04:31.333
Trick question! You like it,
too. (laughs)

04:31.417 --> 04:33.250
You girls. Excuse me, Elaine,

04:33.333 --> 04:36.375
I actually need
his opinion on something.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.250
I'd say she's pregnant.

04:39.834 --> 04:41.500
Just a terrific catch
there, newbie.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.667
Listen to her heart, will ya?
I heard mitral stenosis,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.875
and I need an extra set of ears.
Let's go.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.208
It's kind of flattering
that you'd choose me--

04:48.291 --> 04:50.917
Ears, newbie, ears.
Not mouth.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.834
Ted, Dr. Koppleman
has notified me

04:55.917 --> 04:58.625
that he will be vacating
the office next to mine.

04:58.709 --> 05:01.208
His deteriorating health
has made it impossible

05:01.291 --> 05:02.875
for him to continue
on with us.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.125
Oh, dear!
Should we send him a card?

05:05.208 --> 05:07.125
Absolutely.

05:07.208 --> 05:09.792
See if you can
find one that says,

05:09.875 --> 05:11.333
"Crippling arthritis or not,

05:11.417 --> 05:13.208
I want you out of
my hospital by sundown

05:13.291 --> 05:14.458
so I can knock
down your wall

05:14.542 --> 05:16.375
and make myself
a giant office."

05:16.959 --> 05:18.709
You're a wonderful man.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.709
Ted, I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

05:20.792 --> 05:22.959
but a man's office
is a reflection

05:23.041 --> 05:25.000
of who he is,
don't you think?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.083
(drip)

05:29.959 --> 05:31.208
Yeah.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.291
Ralphie, spit it out.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.083
Spit it out!
Come on, come on!

05:37.166 --> 05:38.458
Ohh!

05:39.208 --> 05:41.208
Dude, why eat
medical supplies

05:41.291 --> 05:42.542
when you've got pudding
and tater tots?

05:42.625 --> 05:44.083
It makes no sense.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.750
Hey. Get the ring back?

05:46.834 --> 05:48.083
Did I...

05:48.166 --> 05:51.834
Get the ring back?
Dude, I'm back, okay? (laughs)

05:51.917 --> 05:53.125
Now, I got it all set up.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.959
She's goin' out of town for,
like, a week, right?

05:54.959 --> 05:56.458
So I got somebody
to cover for me tonight.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.250
I'm gonna take her
to a nice restaurant...

06:00.792 --> 06:02.250
Dude, you better
open your--

06:02.333 --> 06:04.625
oh, you're killin' me, Ralphie!
You are killin'--

06:04.709 --> 06:06.917
no, you did not just swallow
that thing!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.166
You...

06:09.125 --> 06:11.375
Dr. Kelso, I am through
taking my clothes off

06:11.458 --> 06:12.458
in front of men!

06:12.542 --> 06:14.291
I think I can speak
for all of us

06:14.375 --> 06:16.375
when I say, we'll live.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.375
Every woman here hates the fact
that they've gotta get undressed

06:18.458 --> 06:19.959
in a co-ed locker room.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.500
Except for Naked Nancy, but,
I mean, she's an exhibitionist,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.375
and she's got a whole
other set of problems.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.542
We have a co-ed locker room?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.083
Hot damn.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.750
Dr. Reid, if you really
feel the need to discuss it,

06:31.834 --> 06:33.500
just write it out
on a piece of paper

06:33.583 --> 06:35.583
and slip it
in my suggestion box.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.834
-Really?
-Yes! Ted, show it to her.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.583
Sorry.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.166
It's OK.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.458
So, uh...

06:46.542 --> 06:47.792
This locker room...

06:48.500 --> 06:49.750
Do you have to
be a doctor

06:49.834 --> 06:51.792
to change
in there or what?

06:54.709 --> 06:56.375
-Can I borrow a pen?
-Here.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.041
-Take this one.
-Thanks.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.417
See?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.667
We don't always have to
be like, "Bleh-bleh-bleh."

07:03.917 --> 07:06.083
We can be like, "hey, how you
doin'?" "I'm good. Thanks."

07:06.166 --> 07:07.375
This can work, you know?
We can--

07:07.458 --> 07:08.583
we can be there
for each other.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.250
It's just a pen, Scooter,
not a kidney.

07:11.792 --> 07:12.792
Ohh...

07:12.875 --> 07:14.375
-Thanks.
-No!

07:15.500 --> 07:17.375
-You keep it.
-Really?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.333
Makes me look smarter.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.625
Heh.
Off to scrub the crappers.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.667
(Dr. Cox) So, here's the deal,
Mrs. Larkin--

07:29.750 --> 07:31.875
you have a valvular defect
in your heart.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.542
-Ohh, God!
-Relax, Steve. He's a worrier.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.250
Me, too.
I'm a worrier.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
-The thing is--
-Oh, here it comes!

07:40.166 --> 07:41.417
The thing is
that pregnancy

07:41.500 --> 07:43.458
puts such an extra strain
on your heart

07:43.542 --> 07:45.875
that, had we known about
this condition beforehand,

07:45.959 --> 07:48.208
we would've strongly
suggested you think twice

07:48.291 --> 07:49.458
about even getting pregnant

07:49.542 --> 07:51.083
before getting
the valve repaired.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.625
I would've done it anyways.

07:52.709 --> 07:53.917
Yeah, you would've.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.542
You got a healthy supply
of pluck about ya, don't ya?

07:57.208 --> 07:58.208
I can't breathe!

07:58.291 --> 07:59.875
You're ok.
Let's do this.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.250
I love the pluck.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.208
How could any woman
possibly stand this?

08:06.125 --> 08:07.542
Hey, Nancy.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.000
(Turk) You've had
six bran muffins, Ralphie.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.709
How is it that you
don't have to go yet?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.500
Turk, I still
have to pack tonight.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.792
Are you sure you
wanna have dinner?

08:24.875 --> 08:26.000
I am positive.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.333
-Okay? All right.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

08:28.417 --> 08:29.750
Hey, cutie.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.750
All right,
Ralphie, new tack.

08:31.834 --> 08:32.834
I want you to do what I do.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.375
Okay? I want you to imagine

08:34.458 --> 08:37.291
that there are tiny men
inside your booty

08:37.375 --> 08:38.625
tryin' to push the dookie--

08:38.709 --> 08:40.291
push the dookie out,
Ralphie.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.959
Can you imagine that for me?

08:43.917 --> 08:46.166
You told my son there were
little men inside him?

08:46.291 --> 08:47.750
He barely sleeps
as it is!

08:47.834 --> 08:49.583
Sir, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.417
-That was sick!
-But still...

08:51.959 --> 08:53.458
if you could do this for me,

08:53.542 --> 08:55.041
I would greatly
appreciate it.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.625
The next time your son
has a bowel movement,

08:57.709 --> 08:58.917
take the dookie,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.583
put it in a Ziploc bag,

09:00.667 --> 09:01.959
and just call me
on my cell phone.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.458
It's for my girlfriend.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.917
-Ohh!
-Hey, Ralphie!

09:07.000 --> 09:09.166
Little men pushin' it out!

09:09.250 --> 09:11.083
Pushin' it out!

09:11.166 --> 09:13.417
That Mrs. Larkin's
an aggressive lady.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.917
She won't even let
her husband finish a sent--

09:15.000 --> 09:16.750
Oh, shut the hell up,
would you please?

09:16.834 --> 09:18.583
At least she's ballsy,
unlike that husband,

09:18.667 --> 09:20.500
who's the overly thoughtful,
sensitive type

09:20.583 --> 09:22.000
that drive me crazy.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.000
What?

09:24.083 --> 09:26.417
Nah, I just-- I think the
Larkins complement each other.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.750
They're a good team.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.458
They kind of
remind me of us.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.625
Roseanne, now, granted,
I was, as usual,

09:31.709 --> 09:33.125
only halfway
listening to you,

09:33.208 --> 09:34.291
but I get
the sinking feeling

09:34.375 --> 09:36.375
you just compared us
to a married couple.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.917
I know--I know
a girl can dream, but...

09:39.375 --> 09:41.458
This is never gonna happen.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.583
Get in here.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.959
She went into
atrial fibrillation.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.291
Newbie, call an OB-GYN
for an emergency consult

09:48.375 --> 09:49.375
and notify the N.I.C.U.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.291
What the hell
is going on?

09:51.750 --> 09:54.000
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes it's hard</i>
<i>to find the right words...</i>

09:56.000 --> 09:58.834
Once I knock down
this wall right here,

09:58.917 --> 10:00.750
I am going
to have more room

10:00.834 --> 10:02.834
than I know
what to do with.

10:02.917 --> 10:05.375
Sir, I'm so happy
for you I could crap.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.709
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes words come easy...</i>

10:07.792 --> 10:11.333
Dr. Kelso?
I demand a female locker room.

10:13.792 --> 10:14.875
I loved it,

10:14.959 --> 10:17.959
but why spend all this money
on this fancy dinner?

10:18.208 --> 10:20.500
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes the words</i>
<i>don't come out at all...</i>

10:22.166 --> 10:23.333
No reason.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.583
(J.D.) <i>But ultimately,</i>
<i>you've to grit your teeth</i>

10:26.667 --> 10:27.667
<i>and just say it.</i>

10:27.750 --> 10:29.625
If we don't deliver this baby,
your wife could die.

10:29.959 --> 10:30.917
(J.D.) <i>You see, as a doctor,</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:33.500
<i>you get used to the whole</i>
<i>balance in the hospital thing--</i>

10:33.583 --> 10:35.875
<i>you know, when one person</i>
<i>lives, another dies,</i>

10:35.959 --> 10:37.834
<i>and how it always</i>
<i>seems to even out?</i>

10:37.917 --> 10:40.583
But it's so soon.
You said so yourself.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.250
What's gonna happen
to the baby?

10:42.333 --> 10:44.250
We're gonna
do our best.

10:45.709 --> 10:46.959
(J.D.)
<i>But, it never seems fair</i>

10:47.041 --> 10:49.000
<i>when it happens</i>
<i>in the same family.</i>

10:53.834 --> 10:56.417
You're telling me if we don't
deliver the baby now

10:56.500 --> 10:58.083
my wife could die.

10:58.417 --> 10:59.417
And if we do,

10:59.500 --> 11:01.083
our child probably
won't live.

11:01.667 --> 11:02.834
(J.D.)
<i>Sometimes, as a doctor,</i>

11:02.917 --> 11:05.208
<i>I wish my life was more</i>
<i>like my favorite TV show.</i>

11:06.667 --> 11:08.625
Oh, come on,
death isn't that bad.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.125
Especially if you're
dying from laughter!

11:11.208 --> 11:12.500
You're on<i> Candid Camera!</i>
(laughing)

11:12.583 --> 11:13.917
(laughing)
No, I'm not!

11:14.000 --> 11:15.417
(laughing)
Honey, no!

11:15.500 --> 11:17.542
Oh, I'll give you a "honey, no."
Steve, come on out.

11:17.625 --> 11:18.792
Where--where
are the cameras?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.542
We got ya! There's
a camera there...

11:20.625 --> 11:22.291
There... And there!

11:23.333 --> 11:25.667
Mr. Larkin, we need a decision
from you here.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.542
I'm not ready to do that.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.083
You go. I'll cover her.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.834
Dr. Kelso, I am not leaving here

11:34.917 --> 11:36.250
until I get an answer.

11:36.709 --> 11:37.917
Sweetheart,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.542
there are lots of people

11:39.625 --> 11:42.041
who think the hospital
would be a better place

11:42.125 --> 11:43.583
if we made some changes.

11:43.667 --> 11:44.959
Take Ted, for instance.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.667
I feel I'd be more productive

11:47.750 --> 11:49.375
if my phone dialed out.

11:50.041 --> 11:53.417
This hospital has always
had a co-ed locker room.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.125
Back when I was a resident,

11:57.208 --> 12:01.834
I remember, blah, blah, blah,
nostalgic story.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.458
Now get the hell
out of my office!

12:04.375 --> 12:05.667
Not you, Ted.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.625
Ted, get the hell out
of my office!

12:17.875 --> 12:19.458
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

12:19.542 --> 12:21.625
I'm only going
to Chicago for five days.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.625
I'll call you when I land.

12:24.625 --> 12:25.625
See ya!

12:26.291 --> 12:28.250
-(Turk) Baby, don't go!
-Have you seen Mr. Larkin?

12:28.333 --> 12:29.417
Uh, no.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.709
Thanks for the pen.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.083
Oh, no.

12:33.166 --> 12:35.166
Yeah. This is
my favorite t-shirt.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.959
And this
is my favorite skin.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.291
Well, you know that I would
never mean for that to happen.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.750
-You know that, right?
-Yeah, I know that.

12:42.834 --> 12:43.959
Okay, this is
a little cozy for me.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.375
Is it?

12:47.709 --> 12:50.500
I don't think you people are
getting how difficult this is.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.041
Trust me, I wouldn't want to
have to make this decision.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.542
I wish I could ask my wife.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.667
She'd be better at handling this
than me.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.208
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.667
We may seem
like the kind of guy

13:03.750 --> 13:05.583
you can just, you know,
throw in a headlock

13:05.667 --> 13:08.000
and draw a mustache
on, but...

13:08.709 --> 13:09.709
(cracks knuckles)

13:09.792 --> 13:12.750
In crunch time
we always come through.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.709
It's time.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.041
Come on.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.709
Dr. Reid,
are you off for the day?

13:22.792 --> 13:25.375
Oh, I just didn't have
a place to change.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.208
Mm-hmm.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.834
Laverne, I'm going to pretend
you're not wearing that.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.667
Don't you usually wait till you
get home before you do that?

13:33.750 --> 13:35.583
Plus, according
to county statute,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.000
all medical facilities
in this region

13:37.083 --> 13:38.875
are required to provide
single-sex bathrooms

13:38.959 --> 13:40.917
and change rooms
for their employees.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.667
Put that in your suggestion box
and smoke it.

13:45.792 --> 13:46.792
Damn it.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.208
Where did she learn
all that legal mumbo-jumbo?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.125
(blowing)

13:52.500 --> 13:53.834
What are you doing, Ted?

13:53.917 --> 13:55.667
I'm trying to whistle.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.458
You know, so you wouldn't think
it was me.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.375
Stop the cab!

14:04.458 --> 14:06.625
Whoa! Hey! Open the door!

14:06.709 --> 14:09.041
Baby, open the door!
Open the damn door!

14:09.125 --> 14:10.417
Turk!

14:10.834 --> 14:12.083
What are you doing?

14:12.542 --> 14:15.500
-(Elderly woman) Take it.
-Sorry, ma'am. My bad.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.792
What is going on?

14:16.875 --> 14:19.125
I gotta ask you
something before you go.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.667
What?

14:23.834 --> 14:25.083
You're doin' great.

14:25.166 --> 14:26.625
You're gonna be fine.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.875
Nice job, newbie.
That's a real nice job.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.583
All we gotta do now
is cross our fingers.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.625
(J.D.) <i>Death is always hangin'</i>
<i>around this hospital...</i>

14:36.792 --> 14:37.917
Morning.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.417
(thunder)

14:40.208 --> 14:41.667
(J.D.)
<i>Ultimately it all boils down</i>

14:41.750 --> 14:43.083
<i>to what your attitude</i>
<i>is about it.</i>

14:43.166 --> 14:44.959
I'm not afraid
of death.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.834
I mean, if I got a heart,
that would be great.

14:48.166 --> 14:51.083
Still, if they told me
it was never gonna happen...

14:51.583 --> 14:53.166
I think that would be okay too.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.083
It's the waiting I can't take.

14:55.166 --> 14:57.083
I just wanna know one way
or the other, you know?

14:57.583 --> 14:58.917
I got an idea.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.875
Why don't we switch
to a cheerier subject?

15:03.083 --> 15:04.583
What do you think
death is like?

15:04.750 --> 15:08.917
I really hope it's like
a big Broadway musical.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.542
Everyone's all dressed up

15:10.625 --> 15:12.625
and singing to the rafters,

15:12.709 --> 15:15.291
and you go out
with a real flourish.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.750
I think it's like
a game of dodge ball.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.875
(chuckles)

15:19.959 --> 15:22.875
There's a lot
of chaos and screaming,

15:22.959 --> 15:24.208
and, you know,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.291
eventually you get
your glasses snapped in half

15:26.375 --> 15:28.375
by the big kid who already
has underarm hair...

15:29.041 --> 15:31.000
but then you wake up
in the hot nurse's office,

15:31.083 --> 15:34.083
and when she leans in to put
that bandage on your nose,

15:34.166 --> 15:36.166
you get a sense that something
could actually happen

15:36.250 --> 15:37.792
if you just took a chance

15:37.875 --> 15:40.375
and buried your face
in her knockers.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.041
Holy cow. I'm so sorry.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.750
I guess, for my part,

15:45.834 --> 15:48.083
I think death is a lot like
that story, quite frankly,

15:48.166 --> 15:50.166
but-- if there is a God--

15:50.250 --> 15:53.000
it'll be a lot quicker
and half as painful.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.417
It's fun to annoy him.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.125
It's what I do.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.125
(laughs)

16:01.333 --> 16:03.333
So I hear they're
making that office

16:03.417 --> 16:05.041
into the ladies'
locker room, huh?

16:05.125 --> 16:07.291
-Yes, Ted.
-Bummer.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.041
Hey, maybe whoever's over here

16:16.125 --> 16:17.917
might not stay there forever.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.917
Well, I'm here doing
a research fellowship,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.375
so I'll be anywhere from 15
to 25 years. (laughs)

16:24.083 --> 16:25.792
-That's a long time.
-Yeah.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.542
You'll probably be dead.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.000
So, we've known each other

16:34.083 --> 16:35.542
for, like, a year and a half,
right?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.709
-Turk, that's my ride.
-Yeah, I know.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.458
Just give me a second.
Just give me a second, okay?

16:39.542 --> 16:41.583
-I've been thinkin' a lot lately.
-(horn honks)

16:41.667 --> 16:43.041
I'm talkin' here!

16:43.125 --> 16:44.750
Turk, I'm gonna miss my flight.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.458
I gotta go, honey. I'm sorry.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.291
Will you marry me?

16:50.041 --> 16:51.041
What did you say?

16:51.125 --> 16:52.709
I think I said, w--

16:53.250 --> 16:54.625
will you marry me?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.375
Turk, wow!

16:56.458 --> 16:57.959
I got a ring.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.959
I don't have it on me,
but...

17:02.875 --> 17:04.083
it's in a safe place.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.458
I can't believe this.

17:08.875 --> 17:09.875
I--

17:10.375 --> 17:11.875
I've imagined you
saying this to me,

17:11.959 --> 17:13.250
like, a thousand times.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.458
I just never imagined

17:16.542 --> 17:19.542
that when you actually asked
all I would say is...

17:21.375 --> 17:22.625
I need to think.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.125
Cool!

17:28.083 --> 17:29.417
Yeah, phew.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.834
That's what I was hoping
to hear.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.959
I love you.

17:35.667 --> 17:36.917
I really do.

17:40.625 --> 17:41.792
Love you too.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.041
I'll be back
in a few days.

17:49.458 --> 17:50.709
I'll wait.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.667
Congratulations,
you guys.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.000
