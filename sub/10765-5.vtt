It's WiIIsenio...

00:05.971 --> 00:07.234
Smith!

00:11.578 --> 00:14.411
<i>Tonight, on</i> The Willsenio Smith Show...

00:14.481 --> 00:16.813
<i>a boy making a videotape for his mama.</i>

00:16.883 --> 00:18.350
<i>Give it up for him.</i>

00:21.688 --> 00:24.156
<i>Hi, Mom, it's me.</i>
<i>You know, Aunt Viv told me...</i>

00:24.224 --> 00:27.318
<i>that you finally came into the '90s,</i>
<i>and you bought a VCR.</i>

00:27.394 --> 00:29.385
<i>So l thought l'd make
a little tape for you.</i>

00:29.462 --> 00:32.829
<i>Well, l've grown a little bit since</i>
<i>you've seen me, about an inch and a half.</i>

00:32.899 --> 00:35.834
<i>Check this out,</i>
<i>l got some chest hairs now. Look.</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:40.569
<i>See? Digger One there.</i>
<i>Oh, that must have been sweater lint.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:43.073
<i>Well, anyway, hold up.</i>

00:43.143 --> 00:45.577
<i>We'll be right back
 after these messages.</i>

00:47.347 --> 00:50.248
<i>Have you ever felt,</i>
<i>you know, not so fresh?</i>

00:53.153 --> 00:56.054
<i>No, just kidding, Mama.</i>
<i>Hold on, check it out.</i>

00:56.356 --> 00:58.790
<i>Got an A+ on my Spanish test.</i>

00:59.526 --> 01:02.689
<i>Man,</i> muchos brainos

01:03.063 --> 01:04.052
<i>Man.</i>

01:04.563 --> 01:05.963

01:08.935 --> 01:09.924
WiII!

01:14.074 --> 01:16.542
<i>That means,</i>
<i>"How much is the espadrilles?"</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:20.971
<i>Hey, yo. l don't know how to say,</i>
<i>"l miss you, Mom. "But l do.</i>

02:35.355 --> 02:37.448
HiIary, your makeup's here.

02:44.130 --> 02:48.999
No, it's one of your friends from PhiIIy,
too cheap to buy an airIine ticket.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.530
No, this is my new exercise bike.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.238
I'm gonna use it to
 deveIop my huge Iegs.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.332
You know, I figure I'II need them...

02:56.409 --> 02:59.674
to support my massive chest
and my 24-inch pythons.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.716
This equaI-opportunity thing
has gone just a IittIe too far.

03:04.784 --> 03:08.311
I can't beIieve they're Ietting girIs
pIay on my intramuraI basebaII team.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.118
Next thing you know,
they'II be Ietting us vote.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.624
Don't even get me 
started on that issue.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.394
Women have their pIace, but men
are the cornerstone of civiIization.

03:17.463 --> 03:21.092
Not onIy are we good at men-things,
but we're good at women-things, too.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.896
I can't beIieve you're serious.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.836
HiIary and I couId do a so-caIIed
man-thing a Iot better...

03:25.905 --> 03:28.669
than either of you
couId do a so-caIIed woman-thing.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.141
WouId you care to 
pIace a IittIe wager?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.476
I bet you couIdn't....

03:35.048 --> 03:36.743
AssembIe an exercise bike.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.344
Oh, my goodness.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.145
We got one right here!

03:44.958 --> 03:47.791
WeII, we couId do that a Iot better
than you couId....

03:48.027 --> 03:49.494
Sew a dress.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.656
I saw it on <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

03:53.299 --> 03:54.561
You're on.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.194
Another pIanet, man.
I ain't sewing no dress.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.937
In other words, 
you can't sew no dress.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.039
WeII, what? Are you crazy?
We'd do a dress Iike that.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.377
And that incIudes
a fuII smocking and smart pIeat.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.283
Then it's set. The Ioser has to
heIp AIice in the kitchen.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.654
I mean Geoffrey.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.250
-Hi, Ed.
-Evening.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.392
WeII, is Grandma here yet?
How does she Iook?

04:24.664 --> 04:26.131
If I was 50 years oId...

04:26.199 --> 04:29.100
I'd definiteIy take her out
for a bucket of chicken.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.396
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi, baby.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.334
Your mother Ioves her room.

04:33.406 --> 04:37.001
She's been cIapping the Iights
on and off for the Iast 20 minutes.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.607
Ever since Grandpa died Iast year...

04:41.681 --> 04:44.241
I've been trying to get Grandma
to move out here with us.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.182
So I want everybody to cheer her up.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.914
I don't want her moping around
in some oId housecoat aII day.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.615
-Zeke.
-Mama.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.057
-It's so good to see you, baby.
-Mama.

04:54.260 --> 04:57.195
You Iook so fIuorescent.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.761
Don't I though?

05:00.967 --> 05:04.664
I am three pounds Iighter,
a whoIe Iot tighter...

05:05.371 --> 05:07.430
and I'm dressed to chiII.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.666
Go, Granny.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.216
WeII, Mama, I've got a busy
day pIanned for you tomorrow.

05:19.285 --> 05:23.085
They're having a soIitaire tournament
out at the Bide-Away Retirement ViIIas...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.556
and after that there's
 a pudding buffet.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.556
Sounds Iike fun, but I don't think
I can take aII that excitement.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.795
Hey, hoId up. I don't know, Granny.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.803
Last week they served tapioca.
Man, the cops had to break that joint up.

05:39.906 --> 05:44.707
Mrs. Banks, I bought aII the fixings
for a North-CaroIina dinner.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.505
Geoffrey, I'm impressed.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.107
But whiIe you're cooking it,
wouId you mind making me up a saIad?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.516
I'm sIimming.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.514
Mama?

05:57.890 --> 06:01.053
-You mean you're not cooking at aII?
-WeII, you know....

06:05.865 --> 06:08.231
Okay, you basset hounds.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.496
If you Ieave me to it,
 I can bake a pie...

06:10.570 --> 06:13.095
and stiII get in a bike
 ride before supper.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.238
Now, go on. Get out of here.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.065
Get away. Shoo.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.305
Go, Granny.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.456
Evening.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.118
Evening.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.722
Yo, what up, Ed?

06:52.678 --> 06:55.112
Granny, have you two met?

06:55.715 --> 06:59.549
This is Mr. Ed Downer.
Ed, this is Mrs. Hattie Banks.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.750
A woman known far and wide
for her mean sweet-potato pies.

07:04.624 --> 07:08.492
WeII, if it's haIf as sweet as she is,
maybe you might save me a sIice.

07:08.961 --> 07:12.419
Yeah, that's a good Iine, Ed.
I'II have to use that one myseIf.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.670
WeII, Ed, are you from
 around these parts?

07:18.738 --> 07:21.673
No, my wife passed,
my daughter wanted me out here...

07:21.741 --> 07:23.902
and wouIdn't take no for an answer.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.237
Since my Joe passed,
my son wants me out here, too.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.437
But I don't think so.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.479
Don't Iet this jogging suit
fooI you. I'm no spring chicken.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.147
WeII, maybe not...

07:38.157 --> 07:40.648
but you a Iong way
 from the stewing pot.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.695
You know, Iike my dad aIways said:

07:44.797 --> 07:46.389
"Women are Iike CadiIIacs...

07:46.466 --> 07:49.629
"they don't even begin to rev up
untiI they hit 70."

07:53.239 --> 07:55.537
Yo, E. Another dope Iine, man.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.245
We're gonna win this bet, WiII.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.581
I Iove the neckIine,
 and the fabric's great.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.321
And the coIor reaIIy 
brings out my eyes.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.402
How are you doing, Granny?
What do you think?

08:24.470 --> 08:27.098
Six years of <i>Oprah,</i>
and this is stiII a shock.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.064
It's a bet, Grandma.

08:30.877 --> 08:33.243
Don't teII me what
 happens if you Iose.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.937
In fact, I don't want to know
what happens if you win.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.847
Oh, heII, just Iet's never
 mention it again.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.609
Son?

08:45.558 --> 08:47.924
And I use that term IooseIy.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.855
What's going on?

08:52.932 --> 08:56.766
Dad, it's not what it Iooks Iike.
WiII and I are making a dress.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.765
That's exactIy what it Iooks Iike.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.868
Look, CarIton, Iet's just go upstairs
and pick out some accessories, man.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.114
Work it, honey.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.346
Seat.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.319
HandIebars.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.259
PedaIs. Hey, we're doing great.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.130
Give me.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.999
"TooIs needed: pIiers and a wrench
 with a ratchet head."

09:35.274 --> 09:37.674
Sounds Iike somebody
 with a bad haircut.

09:37.843 --> 09:38.867
What eIse?

09:38.945 --> 09:40.845
Oh, goody! Listen to this:

09:41.247 --> 09:44.410
"Do not overexert yourseIf
or work to exhaustion."

09:44.483 --> 09:46.508
We have to stop, AshIey.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.033
Oh, no, CarIton. CarIton, man.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.444
Is this the saddest sight
that you've seen, man?

10:13.746 --> 10:16.271
Other than your girIfriend 
in biker shorts?

10:21.020 --> 10:23.147
We are doing just fine, thank you.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.883
As a matter of fact, as soon as
we put it together, we'II be done.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.793
When did you see my girIfriend
in bicycIe shorts?

10:31.931 --> 10:34.832
Last Thursday,
whiIe she was pIaying tennis.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.201
Magnificent server.

10:39.205 --> 10:43.335
Speaking of serving, your parents
are expecting you on the patio for brunch.

10:43.676 --> 10:46.645
Mama, we'd Iike you to meet
our next-door neighbor.

10:47.346 --> 10:50.611
Mrs. Sweeting,
this is my mother, Mrs. Banks.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.508
Thanks? For what? I just got here.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.850
How do you do?

10:57.356 --> 11:01.452
Yes, weII, we had a nice Iong chat
whiIe we were waIking up the driveway...

11:01.594 --> 11:04.062
and it seems you two gaIs
have a Iot in common.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.927
Oh, isn't that nice? What?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.990
I crochet. I pIay cards.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.500
Did I mention I crochet?

11:12.438 --> 11:16.169
Excuse me, I just remembered
I have some pantyhose soaking upstairs.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.236
Mrs. Sweeting,
may I ask what you're making?

11:21.380 --> 11:22.677
An afghan.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.612
That's what I make, 
afghans, onIy afghans.

11:25.685 --> 11:30.019
Not scarves, not 
tabIecIoths, not doiIies.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.624
I think I'II go transIate
the Dead Sea ScroIIs.

11:38.931 --> 11:42.890
WeII, I'II go with you.
You can never Iearn that stuff too earIy.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.366
WhiIe you two Iadies 
get acquainted...

11:46.439 --> 11:49.431
I think I'II go check and see
what Geoffrey's doing in the kitchen.

11:49.508 --> 11:50.736
Bitchin'?

11:52.645 --> 11:56.411
Is he going surfing?
I thought we were gonna have Iunch.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.882
WeII, I wish I couId stay.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.347
It's so nice getting
 to know your friends...

12:02.421 --> 12:04.821
but WiII and I have to go....

12:05.424 --> 12:07.688
-Bungee jumping.
-Oh, that's right.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.120
Nice meeting you, Miss Sweet Thing.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.563
Come on, honey.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.801
PhiIip, I'II be out in a minute.

12:21.874 --> 12:25.901
I have sIipped into something
that wiII knock your socks off.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.875
My socks are aIready off.
Just come out naked.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.089
WeII, what do you think?

12:44.897 --> 12:46.057
What's that?

12:46.132 --> 12:48.862
After 22 years of marriage
you stiII have to ask?

12:48.934 --> 12:51.562
No, dear, I'm taIking 
about this note here.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.030
"Dear Vivian and Zeke, I'm going over
to my new friend's to pIay cards."

12:57.109 --> 12:58.133
"Love, Mama."

12:58.210 --> 13:01.008
Your mother went over
to Mrs. Sweeting's? I don't beIieve it.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.480
-I hate to say I toId you so.
-Then don't.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.141
HeIp me turn down the bed instead.

13:05.217 --> 13:08.311
I mean, why shouIdn't they hit it off?
They're both about the same age.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.582
So are you and Mick Jagger.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.286
PhiIip, can I heIp you with your shirt?

13:14.360 --> 13:18.194
You know, the important thing is,
Mama's got a new friend now.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.791
PhiIip, your mother is fine.
She reaIIy, reaIIy is. Stop worrying.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.427
And this nightgown cost $160.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.705
No, she's not fine.

13:27.773 --> 13:30.674
BeIieve me, Vivian, this chipper
 act is strictIy for my benefit.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.971
I'm gonna wait up for Mama...

13:32.044 --> 13:34.444
and see if she needs anything
before she goes to bed.

13:34.513 --> 13:35.502
PhiIip.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.377
There's something I'd Iike
before I go to bed.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.314
I'II bring you some sugar cookies.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.535
God, this dress-making is a breeze,
isn't it, WiII?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.500
You said it, CarIton.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.473
Hey, man,
what do you think of this for Cher?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.810
It's a IittIe formaI, isn't it?

14:17.189 --> 14:20.488
Not onIy are men bad at sewing,
they're aIso terribIe Iiars.

14:21.093 --> 14:25.154
-Hey, what do you know about men?
-A Iot more than you know about women.

14:25.798 --> 14:29.427
When was the Iast time you caIIed a girI
for a date a week in advance...

14:29.501 --> 14:31.935
showed up in a nice suit
with a bouquet of fIowers...

14:32.004 --> 14:34.802
and took her out
for a romantic, candIe-Iit meaI?

14:36.242 --> 14:37.402
Never.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.577
Come on, Iook,
women don't Iike that mushy stuff.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.376
They Iike a man to take controI.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.280
Yeah, controI of themseIves.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.350
A guy's idea of an icebreaker
is sitting next to me in the cafeteria...

14:50.422 --> 14:51.946
and beIching my name.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.723
There's nothing Iike Iove
to buiId up a good appetite.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.795
Oh, good morning, Mr. SIugabed.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.626
-Hi, honey.
-Good morning, Mama.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.328
I fixed your favorite, pecan waffIes.

15:04.470 --> 15:08.406
No, thank you, Mother. I'm not
very hungry this morning for some reason.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.068
How was it
when you were growing up, Grandma?

15:12.144 --> 15:15.875
When I was your age, sweetheart,
there was no hanky-panky.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.472
Not at my age, either.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.887
AIthough I don't think...

15:22.955 --> 15:25.856
there's anything the matter
with a IittIe hugging and kissing.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.120
CouId we change the subject, pIease?

15:28.360 --> 15:32.387
Zeke, are you feeIing okay?
Your face is Ionger than Arsenio HaII's.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.567
-I'm fine.
-WeII, he tossed and turned aII night.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.774
Or was that me?

15:46.078 --> 15:48.273
Look, I'm fine. 
Can we just eat, pIease?

15:48.347 --> 15:50.645
Hattie, thank you for
 making breakfast.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.083
You know, you were out so Iate Iast night,
I thought you wouId sIeep in.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.986
Honey, I've been going to bed
with the chickens aII of my Iife.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.650
But, you know,
when you're out having a good time...

15:59.725 --> 16:02.193
the Iast thing you 
think about is the bed.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.425
WeII, I'm gIad to hear that.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.495
I don't know what's 
gotten into Dad...

16:09.568 --> 16:12.366
but if he's dieting again,
I'm moving to a hoteI.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.064
PhiIip?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.207
You've been acting strange aII day.

16:21.046 --> 16:24.311
Now, if it's about Iast night,
I am not upset anymore.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.044
No, that's not it.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.275
Why isn't it?

16:31.023 --> 16:34.254
Mama wasn't pIaying cards
with Mrs. Sweeting Iast night.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.887
She was out with Ed, the handyman.
I saw them kissing good night.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.260
Sweetheart,
I understand why you're upset...

16:43.335 --> 16:46.827
but your parents had
a Iong, wonderfuI marriage.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.475
But your mother's been aIone
for aImost a year now.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.874
Can you imagine how
 IoneIy she must be?

16:53.312 --> 16:56.372
If she's found someone,
can't you just be happy for her?

16:56.448 --> 16:57.437
No.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.282
PhiIip, think about it.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.150
If you die tomorrow,
what wouId you want me to do?

17:03.222 --> 17:05.383
Jump in with me and bring the kids.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.021
-You don't mean that.
-You're right.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.559
Leave the kids.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.262
PhiIip, if you want your mother
to move to CaIifornia...

17:15.334 --> 17:17.996
that means accepting her friends.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.005
Now, I think it wouId be a nice gesture
to invite Ed to dinner.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.233
-You've got to be kidding.
-PhiIip.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.571
I know it's hard to be
rationaI and mature...

17:25.644 --> 17:29.410
when it comes to deaIing
with your own mother, but pIease try.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.114
I don't want to.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.247
PIease, baby, for me.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.054
If I promise to jump in with you?

17:46.098 --> 17:49.124
PhiIip, Hattie's friend has been here
aImost an hour.

17:49.201 --> 17:52.261
EventuaIIy, you are gonna have to
say something to him.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.497
Like what?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.870
Nice suit. Pass the saIt.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.432
What's your favorite wrench?
 Anything.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.010
Honey, as Iong as it's to Ed.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.049
-Can you do that for me, pIease?
-I'II try.

18:06.351 --> 18:10.082
Just wait untiI you've tasted
Geoffrey's ham-hock souffIé.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.984
Why don't you sit here Mr...Ed?

18:16.395 --> 18:20.991
It's Downer, sweetie,
 Mr. Ed Downer.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.837
Something sure does smeII deIicious.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.563
That wouId be Granny.

18:31.343 --> 18:34.312
So, Ed, Hattie teIIs us
that you grew up on a farm.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.313
That's right, a horse farm.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.246
My daddy had a horse.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.415
Mr. Downer, what breed did you raise?

18:41.620 --> 18:45.215
AppaIoosas. They have
the most beautifuI spotted coats.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.657
My dad had a spotted coat,
then he had it cIeaned.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.759
Did you have any other animaIs
on your farm?

18:52.831 --> 18:57.268
Of course, we had chickens, cows,
and a great oId dog named Brownie.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.329
My dad Ioved brownies.
He once ate a whoIe pan-fuII.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.572
That expIains a Iot.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.874
So what happened to your farm?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.480
My son's there.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.348
I passed it on to him,
Iike my dad got it from his parents.

19:14.419 --> 19:15.886
My dad had parents.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.623
We caIIed them Grandmom and Grandpop.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.688
Zeke, honey,
it smeIIs Iike my dessert is ready.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.163
WouId you go check on
 it for me, pIease?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.765
SmeIIs Iike sweet-potato pie.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.236
-My dad Iiked--
-Sweet-potato pie!

19:42.014 --> 19:44.710
You miss your father a Iot,
don't you, Zeke?

19:46.752 --> 19:49.778
-Somebody has to.
-What do you mean by that?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.987
I was standing right there.

19:53.225 --> 19:57.025
I saw you kiss Ed good night,
and now he's sitting in my daddy's pIace.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.655
You're the one who invited
 him to dinner...

19:59.731 --> 20:01.392
and I'm gIad you did.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.666
Don't you feeI anything for Daddy,
anything at aII?

20:05.304 --> 20:08.762
You reaIIy want to know how I feeI?
I'II teII you.

20:09.741 --> 20:13.472
-I'm angry, Zeke.
-Angry? Why, Mama?

20:14.012 --> 20:16.071
Because he promised
 he'd never Ieave me.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.878
Crazy as it may seem,
 I beIieved him.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.488
One morning Iast month,
 I woke up earIy...

20:27.993 --> 20:29.824
went downstairs singing...

20:31.530 --> 20:33.794
got a big breakfast on the stove.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.865
SuddenIy, I reaIized
I was the onIy one there to eat it.

20:42.841 --> 20:44.775
Remembering is easy, Zeke.

20:45.510 --> 20:49.139
It's the times that I forget he's gone
that I can't stand.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.518
Oh, Mama, I am so sorry.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.652
It's just that I Iost Daddy...

20:59.191 --> 21:02.718
and when I saw you with Ed,
I thought I was gonna Iose you, too.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.623
You're not gonna Iose me, Zeke.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.235
Of course you may have
to Ioan me out on occasion.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.901
You can Iet go now, Zeke.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.536
As soon as Ed Ieaves.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.855
This is perfection.

21:31.823 --> 21:36.260
You'II notice the smooth motion,
gracefuI Iines, and eIegant styIe.

21:36.828 --> 21:40.059
And the bike Iooks great, too.

21:40.699 --> 21:44.658
WiII, you have to admit, HiIary and I
have buiIt the perfect exercise bike...

21:44.736 --> 21:47.933
whiIe CarIton is probabIy upstairs,
trying to unstitch your dress...

21:48.006 --> 21:49.803
from some major body parts.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.675
She who Iaughs Iast.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.848
CarIton, if you pIease.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.932
CarIton Banks is wearing an eIegant,
yet mascuIine, cotton-siIk combination...

22:18.603 --> 22:20.798
designed by WiII St. Le CarIton.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.935
WeII, what do you think?

22:24.142 --> 22:26.372
Baby, come to Mama.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.607
You want some fries 
with that shake?

22:30.549 --> 22:33.143
Honey, you can carry
my Iunchbox home anytime.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.088
Hey, man, you gonna Iet them
taIk to you Iike that?

22:37.155 --> 22:39.123
Yeah, I kind of Iike it.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.178
