00:14.080 --> 00:17.080
<i>(Teal'c) These warriors
are of both Ramius and Tilgath.</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:20.440
<i>(Bra'tac) This meeting did not go well.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:25.160
Some of these warriors
have been shot in the back.

00:25.240 --> 00:30.320
- They were killed while retreating.
- There was no honour in this battle.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
Tilgath.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.840
Ramius must have betrayed
their allegiance.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.920
The first prime of Ramius.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.080
- He is alive.
- You must go from this place.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.600
Why did your master
betray Tilgath? Speak.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.440
We came to forge an alliance.
My master did not do this.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.320
He barely escaped alive.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.520
- Then what happened here?
- One warrior. You must...

03:32.320 --> 03:35.920
- What happened out there?
- Our intelligence was correct.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.760
A summit between
Ramius and Tilgath did take place.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.520
However, when we arrived,
Ramius had fled.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.160
All those who remained had been slain,
including Tilgath.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.680
- By this one man alone?
- From how he fought us, I do not doubt it.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.320
An Ashrak?

03:52.640 --> 03:57.040
- He was unlike any warrior we have met.
- Obviously, you took him down.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.920
He withstood the brunt of our fire
before succumbing.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.120
Its armour must protect it
from energy-based weapons.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.480
If so, we could be dealing with
a new kind of technology.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.800
And this wasn't a setup
by Ramius to kill Tilgath?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.480
Ramius' Jaffa were equally as decimated.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.840
His first prime said
his master barely escaped alive.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.160
So, obviously, someone found out
about the alliance and wanted to stop it.

04:20.240 --> 04:25.560
- Major, run whatever tests you have to.
- I'd like to call the Tok'ra in on this, sir.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.320
Do it. I wanna know
everything we can about this warrior.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.320
The suit must be affecting the MRI.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.520
As long as he's wearing that armour,
we won't learn anything more.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.320
His helmet is made up of two pieces.
Pass me those forceps.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.400
Looks like he's fused into the suit.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.600
Some sort of breathing filtration system.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.920
It's a Goa'uld. Quite frankly,
that's not as shocking as the host.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.840
- How so?
- It has an unusual organ structure.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
Everything's out of proportion.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.280
Physiologically, the heart and lungs
had to be abnormally large

05:54.360 --> 05:57.000
to supply enough blood and oxygen
to its muscles.

05:57.080 --> 06:02.720
Someone tried to genetically engineer the
perfect athlete, with no care for longevity.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.400
Leaving it to the symbiote
to sustain its life.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.800
- An engineered host.
- A seriously flawed one.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.520
Even a Goa'uld symbiote
wouldn't be able to compensate for long.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.200
We're still analysing genetic data,

06:15.280 --> 06:21.480
but for now we can tell you there was
no evident trauma from energy weapons.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.960
What does that mean?

06:23.040 --> 06:27.760
The warrior's armour appears to possess
advanced energy-absorption technology.

06:27.840 --> 06:33.000
If it works how I think it does, it wouldn't
matter how many blasts were fired at it.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.520
<i>- Nothing would get through.
- So Teal'c and Bra'tac didn't kill it?</i>

06:37.600 --> 06:39.000
Yes, sir.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.640
Apparently, the host was on the verge of a
pulmonary failure long before it met them.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.240
It had a heart attack?

06:46.320 --> 06:49.520
Sorry, Teal'c. You didn't stop it.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.640
You and Bra'tac just got lucky.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.440
Its entire cellular structure
is less than three weeks old.

06:58.520 --> 07:03.760
It is organic,
but it was definitely created in a lab.

07:03.840 --> 07:08.560
We know the Goa'uld have been trying
to perfect a host superior to humans.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.560
This is definitely stronger than humans,
but it's far from superior.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.640
Traditionally,
the Goa'uld are also somewhat vain.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.160
This was obviously intended to be
a new form of foot soldier,

07:19.240 --> 07:22.640
possibly a reaction
to the recent uprising of the Jaffa.

07:22.720 --> 07:28.920
What's most interesting is that this being
was not alive when it was first grown.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.600
It was given life
after it reached its mature state.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.920
Frankenstein's monster.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.200
How do you know that?

07:38.680 --> 07:43.040
<i>(Selmak) Remnants of a unique
energy signature within its cells.</i>

07:43.120 --> 07:47.240
It's similar to the residual effects
left by the use of a sarcophagus.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.920
Could it give life to something
that was never alive?

07:50.000 --> 07:56.280
No, a sarcophagus is designed to boost
health or heal someone terminally injured.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.720
- They cannot animate non-living cells.
- Then what could have?

08:00.800 --> 08:05.920
Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a
device originally created by the Ancients.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.800
He determined
its primary purpose was to heal,

08:08.880 --> 08:13.320
but it was so powerful, its effects
on human hosts proved devastating.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.080
However, after much experimentation,

08:16.160 --> 08:20.400
the Goa'uld was able to use the
technology to make the first sarcophagus.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.400
But couldn't eliminate
all its negative side effects.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.560
The Tok'ra have long sought this device

08:25.640 --> 08:29.080
in the hope of using it
to perfect the sarcophagus technology,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.160
so that we could all benefit from it.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.880
Now it may be the key
to fighting this new warrior.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.280
- How?
- With it, we could devise a weapon

08:38.360 --> 08:41.559
to counteract this life-giving energy.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.200
- Who was the first Goa'uld to find it?
- His name was Telchak.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.280
Telchak.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.280
Nicholas Ballard,
my, uh, grandfather.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.160
One of Nick's obsessions was
finding the so-called Fountain of Youth.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.400
He claimed he'd found out
the source of the fountain's power

09:00.480 --> 09:05.240
was a piece of alien technology used by
early Mayan tribes around 900 BC.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.160
Nick traced its origins to Chac,
the Mayan god of rain.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.840
You think Chac may have been Telchak?

09:10.920 --> 09:14.760
- Just a hunch.
- Maybe not just a hunch.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.760
- The device's main function was to heal.
- For the Ancients.

09:18.840 --> 09:23.680
For humans to see an effect, it would be
from limited exposure at a safe distance.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.840
Still, if it was hidden near a water source,
it could be the basis of the mythology.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.760
Nick believed Chac's temple
was in Central America.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.880
He spent decades searching for it,
but came up empty.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
His notes are mostly indecipherable.

09:37.040 --> 09:42.880
The only mention of the temple's location
is somewhere near a waterfall in a river.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.200
This is written in
an obscure dialect of Goa'uld.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.360
- So where is it?
- It's here.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.160
If Selmak's right,
it's in southern Honduras.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.680
How can we be certain
the device is there?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.080
We can't, but, um...

10:00.160 --> 10:03.080
We think we know
who created the Goa'uld warrior.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.480
- Telchak?
- No.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.840
<i>(Selmak)
Telchak created the sarcophagus.</i>

10:07.920 --> 10:11.560
Anubis went to war with him
for possession of the original device.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.920
That was before Anubis tried to ascend.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.080
Anubis defeated Telchak,
but he never did find the device.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.080
It was believed to be hidden
in one of Telchak's temples.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.160
You think Anubis is behind this?

10:23.240 --> 10:28.160
He knew about the technology. He never
found the device, but he wouldn't need to.

10:28.240 --> 10:32.000
He would've gained the knowledge
when he ascended and built a new one.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.200
- Still, it's only a guess.
- Yeah, but it's a good one.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.800
The good news is, sir, the original Ancient
device is probably still here on Earth.

10:40.880 --> 10:44.120
If we could analyse
the technology of this device,

10:44.200 --> 10:48.120
it might be possible to engineer a weapon
to use against these warriors.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.080
Not to mention the possibility
of harnessing its power to heal.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.280
Very well. Dr Jackson,
take Dr Lee and see what you can find.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.360
Dismissed.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.720
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- This is where he said he'd be.

11:16.800 --> 11:22.000
- What if he doesn't show up?
- We have a few beers, make friends.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.480
<i>¡Hola! Muy buenos días, caballeros.</i>

11:33.640 --> 11:35.840
<i>¿Una cerveza? ¿Una tequila?</i>

11:35.920 --> 11:41.240
<i>De hecho, estamos buscando a un guía
Ilamado Rogelio. Él quedo de vernos aquí.</i>

11:41.320 --> 11:44.200
<i>¡Pedro, hazte cargo, tío!</i>

11:44.280 --> 11:48.520
I am Rogelio.
Rogelio Duran, at your service.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.040
This is just my day job.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.600
- You must be Dr Jackson.
- That's right. This is Dr Lee.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.240
<i>- Buenos días.
- Encantado.</i>

11:57.320 --> 12:00.000
So, you guys wanna see some temples?

12:00.080 --> 12:04.160
Actually, we wanna see
one temple in particular.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.760
Here.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.320
I'm sorry to tell you this, señor,
but there are no temples there.

12:11.400 --> 12:16.120
You wanna go north. That's where
all the good stuff is. There's lots of ruins.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
My cousin has a truck.
We could be there in five hours.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.200
Yeah, I'm sure the north is great,
but we really wanna go here.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.720
Señor, I have been to this part
of the country many times.

12:26.800 --> 12:31.160
There is nothing there, I promise you.
North. That's where you wanna go.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.200
Either you take us south,
or we'll find someone who will.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.840
OK, OK, OK. It's your money.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.560
- You say your cousin has a truck?
- Simone. His house is around the corner.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.720
Of course, there is the issue
of filling the tank with gas.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.880
OK! Now we're talking business.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.760
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- Um, look, I need a receipt or something...

13:16.040 --> 13:18.640
If Anubis is truly behind this,

13:18.720 --> 13:22.960
then his strategy is to assassinate
any minor Goa'ulds vulnerable to attack,

13:23.040 --> 13:28.440
absorbing their troops in preparation
for battle with Ba'al and the System Lords.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.360
How many minor Goa'ulds
have suffered attacks?

13:31.440 --> 13:35.080
At least three.
These new warriors are devastating.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.600
- Do we know where they're coming from?
- No.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.120
Our fear is it's only a matter of time
before Anubis targets Earth.

13:41.200 --> 13:47.480
These beings are a threat to all who hope
to one day see the Goa'uld defeated.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.200
If Dr Jackson can recover this device...

13:50.280 --> 13:54.360
Even if he does, there is no guarantee
the Tok'ra can devise a weapon

13:54.440 --> 13:56.960
that can fend off these warriors.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.800
We only learned a limited amount
from our study of the warrior's armour.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.640
The only way to learn more
is through interrogation.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.320
Which means
we have to capture one alive.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.520
What have we got, Major?

14:16.600 --> 14:20.600
The warrior's armour can resist
our strongest armour-piercing weapons,

14:20.680 --> 14:23.040
as well as absorb energy-weapon fire.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.840
However, the material is made up
of a close-knit fibre similar to Kevlar,

14:27.920 --> 14:31.520
meaning something small and sharp
should be able to penetrate it,

14:31.600 --> 14:33.920
such as a fine-tipped trinium dart.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.280
Bra'tac says the fact that Ramius
is still alive makes him a likely target.

14:44.360 --> 14:48.560
There are enough rebel Jaffa under
his command to gain access to the planet.

14:48.640 --> 14:54.200
We stake out the gate on Ramius's planet
and capture a warrior that comes through.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.720
What if one doesn't come through?

14:57.800 --> 15:00.000
Well, we come home, I suppose.

15:00.760 --> 15:04.840
But let's say Bra'tac is right.
We meet his contacts on Ramius's planet,

15:04.920 --> 15:11.160
set up an ambush using a force field to
trap a warrior, and hit it with tranquillisers.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.560
- How does a dart get through the shield?
- They're one-way. They keep things in.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.440
Ah.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.760
- So what do you think?
- I have some notes.

15:40.280 --> 15:45.560
According to the map,
we're in the right place, but, uh...

15:45.640 --> 15:47.640
This makes no sense.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.080
The legend of the Fountain of Youth
says all water flows towards it.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.960
How's that possible?

15:57.040 --> 16:01.400
Maybe the device has special properties,
maybe it's superstition,

16:01.480 --> 16:07.320
or it means the flow from that waterfall
flows in the direction of the temple.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.000
- Well, it should be right here, but...
- Nobody ever listens to me.

16:11.080 --> 16:15.320
I tell them there are no temples out here,
but they come out here anyways.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.200
Now, the north has roads.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.240
We could drive to any temple we want,
but instead we're in this jungle.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.840
Yeah, OK.
Let's spread out, look for a... temple.

16:25.920 --> 16:32.280
In lieu of that, a marker of some kind.
Anything that might tell us where to go.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.760
Go.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.840
Agh!

16:42.040 --> 16:44.120
<i>(echoing) Found it!</i>

16:53.400 --> 16:58.480
This is the best spot for your ambush.
This path leads to the pyramid of Ramius.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.600
I will go now to ensure that
your eventual escape will be undetected.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.079
Brother.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.319
<i>Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.
It is an honour to be in your service.</i>

17:07.400 --> 17:09.880
<i>Many thanks, Adal. Chel nok.</i>

17:11.319 --> 17:13.720
Right, Carter, do your thing.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.240
Reynolds, I want flanking positions
set up on either side.

17:17.319 --> 17:21.920
- Ring the perimeter with claymores.
- Not much faith in plan A?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.560
Since when has plan A ever worked?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.440
Right.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.080
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.840
At least you were right
about there being something here.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.080
We're gonna go look around. Stay put.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.760
You got it, señor. Have fun.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.400
This is definitely early Mayan stonework.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
Oh, yeah.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.920
SG-3 Sierra, this is SG-1 Niner.
What's your status?

18:18.000 --> 18:22.520
<i>We're maintaining position.
Stargate is secure. No activity.</i>

18:26.440 --> 18:28.840
Maybe we should start a pool.

18:34.920 --> 18:40.120
Is this cramped thing getting to you? Why
make these passageways so narrow?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.120
<i>(Daniel) Maybe they were skinny people.</i>

18:43.600 --> 18:46.240
And the roof, too.
Ow, my head. God!

18:46.320 --> 18:48.320
Skinny, short people.

18:56.480 --> 19:01.400
- It's a dead end.
- There's nothing on the walls or ceiling,

19:01.480 --> 19:06.440
no glyphs, no seals, no Ancient script,
not even a pictograph.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.920
Isn't there always writing?

19:13.200 --> 19:17.000
You know, I mean, somewhere
there's bound to be... Maybe not.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.560
<i>SG-1 Niner, this is SG-3 Sierra.</i>

19:19.640 --> 19:23.080
<i>Target has come through the gate
and is en route to your position.</i>

19:23.160 --> 19:25.280
Right, heads up.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.760
Do it.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.880
- Carter?
- I don't understand, sir.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.120
- Hit him again?
- A third dart could kill. We want him alive.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.760
Son of a bitch.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.240
Fire in the hole!

21:01.040 --> 21:02.880
C4!

21:24.240 --> 21:26.680
<i>(jet engines)</i>

21:26.760 --> 21:29.760
Sir, our position's been made.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.960
Grab the wounded and saddle up.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.640
SG-3 Sierra, dial the gate.
We're aborting the mission.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.680
<i>Negative, SG-1. We have major
unfriendly Jaffa closing in on our position.</i>

21:43.760 --> 21:47.240
<i>We cannot hold the gate.
Repeat, Stargate is not secure.</i>

21:48.200 --> 21:52.440
Soon we will be surrounded.
If we fight, many more will die.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.720
What do you wanna do?

21:55.800 --> 21:57.800
Surrender.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.760
There is a chance
Adal and his rebel Jaffa can free us later.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.000
Dr Jackson? Dr Lee?

22:21.240 --> 22:25.920
Yeah, we're here.
We found a chamber. Gonna be a while.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.600
<i>Ah, take your time, señor.</i>

22:30.920 --> 22:33.120
We're paying him by the hour.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.600
I don't understand. How are we supposed
to find this thing if there is no writing?

22:38.680 --> 22:41.400
All water flows towards it.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.440
So?

22:43.520 --> 22:45.520
Give me your canteen.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.880
Here, hold this.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.680
What good's that gonna do?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
<i>(water dripping)</i>

23:24.920 --> 23:27.400
There's something under here.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.080
You're good.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.720
- How's he doing?
- Stable, but we've gotta get him out soon.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.240
I'm fine.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.440
Jaffa!

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
I'll handle this.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
Greetings!

24:07.480 --> 24:10.400
Well, uh, I know how this looks,

24:10.480 --> 24:16.360
so I think it's important we clear up
any misunderstanding right away.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.880
We did not come to kill you.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.640
Honest.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.720
Am I right?

24:29.440 --> 24:36.600
The fact is, and this is the fun part,
we actually came to save your ass...es.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.720
All your asses.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.600
Do you see the irony?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.720
All right,

24:46.800 --> 24:51.160
there's this guy out there,
big guy, big guy in a black suit,

24:51.240 --> 24:53.240
none too fond of you Goa'ulds.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.720
Well, anyway,
he's the one we're after, not you.

24:59.800 --> 25:04.960
So if you wanna let us go, we'll be on
our way to save the world another day.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.640
You're not buying this.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.520
Jaffa!

25:09.720 --> 25:11.720
Kree!

25:15.680 --> 25:17.880
Well, that went well.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.200
That went well.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.040
<i>- (Lee) Well, at least it has writing on it.
- Yeah.</i>

25:56.480 --> 25:58.280
What's it say?

25:58.360 --> 26:00.560
I have no idea.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.800
Oh.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.000
Careful!

26:05.080 --> 26:09.280
It's the root technology of a sarcophagus,
which causes madness and addiction.

26:09.360 --> 26:15.320
This is, supposedly, something far more
powerful, so activating it could be bad.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.200
OK.

26:16.280 --> 26:20.080
Let's try picking it up
without touching it too much.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.760
<i>(rumbling)</i>

26:41.280 --> 26:43.640
Running would be a good idea about now.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.400
Dr Jackson, can you hear me?

26:54.480 --> 26:57.280
<i>(water gushing)</i>

26:59.720 --> 27:02.760
Your friend's condition worsens.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.880
Yeah, well, your friends
can show up anytime now.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.280
We must consider that they may not.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.640
Really?

27:12.720 --> 27:14.720
At least we are alive.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.240
Yes, if you call this living.

27:18.320 --> 27:24.280
You're worried that the super-soldier will
kill Ramius and slaughter the rest of us.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.160
- "Super-soldier"?
- No?

27:27.240 --> 27:29.680
It has a ring.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.640
Most likely,
the warrior was only after Ramius.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.000
When we attacked, its only concern was
escape so that its mission was completed.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.320
So we just sit around
while Ramius gets whacked?

27:40.400 --> 27:42.400
Then what?

27:49.600 --> 27:51.400
Hey.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.560
A little conversation gonna kill ya?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.480
Look, I know you're all about loyalty.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.960
So am I. In fact, many's the time...

28:04.040 --> 28:06.240
- Silence!
- Teal'c?

28:13.200 --> 28:19.200
Hear me, Jaffa. Your master is a false god
and will surely be defeated.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.440
However, you still have
a chance to be free.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.920
Your words mean nothing to me.
I know who you are.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.200
The Shol'va, Teal'c. And Bra'tac.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.880
O'Neill of the Tauri.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.520
Assassins who believe
they could slay my master.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.400
<i>(staff blasts)</i>

28:40.680 --> 28:44.600
Well, if we're assassins, who's that?

28:44.680 --> 28:46.080
Hm?

28:48.680 --> 28:51.280
Dr Jackson, Dr Lee, can you hear me?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.920
Can you hear me?!

29:26.040 --> 29:28.600
Are you OK?
I thought you were dead for sure.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.760
We triggered some sort of trap.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.480
I figured out why those passageways
were so narrow.

29:33.560 --> 29:37.440
- To prevent people from escaping alive.
- You're good.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.520
What have you found?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.400
I'm not going to rob you, señor.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.640
<i>Hostia.</i>

29:55.720 --> 29:57.120
<i>Madre de Dios.</i>

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
<i>(firing/screaming)</i>

30:09.560 --> 30:13.560
Consider this:
does it sound like it's going well?

30:13.640 --> 30:16.440
Your master will die,
as will you, if you do not free us.

30:16.520 --> 30:21.360
You lie. My master is a god.
He is invincible.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.160
<i>(Jaffa shouting orders)</i>

30:29.520 --> 30:31.320
You're next, you know.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.920
Ramius will force you to die for him
while he escapes.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.440
- My god will fight for his people.
- You are wrong, my friend.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.920
Your god is somewhere cowering in fear
like a child. I have seen it before.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.280
He will not hesitate to sacrifice
all your lives to save his own.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.280
Hey!

30:53.360 --> 30:55.920
What about us?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.800
Shouldn't it be getting easier
to convince these guys?

30:58.880 --> 31:00.880
Sir?

31:05.880 --> 31:10.400
- Hang in there, Reynolds.
- As long as it takes.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.880
Ramius has fallen.
Go now, before it comes for you.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.360
Go, go, go! Come on, guys.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.560
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.320
Come on.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.720
If this is a turf thing
we're not aware of, we're sorry.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.040
Oh, no, señor. Please, don't speak.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.280
I'm just saying that whoever
you guys think we are, we're not.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.640
Who do I think you are?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.320
I don't know.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.640
We're scientists. Archaeologists, in fact.

31:59.160 --> 32:04.440
I'm just saying if this is a kidnapping, you
should know we're not worth anything.

32:04.520 --> 32:08.440
Trust me, gringo. Everyone's
worth something to somebody.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.280
I tripped. I'm sorry.
Gee, I can't see anything.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.120
Chalo!

32:20.200 --> 32:22.000
Argh!

32:24.160 --> 32:28.880
- What just happened?
- Your guide, he tried to run.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.960
What can you do?

32:33.120 --> 32:37.040
<i>Maybe now we'll all stay on the path.
Eh, muchachos?</i>

32:37.120 --> 32:38.520
After you.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.680
<i>¡Vámonos!</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:00.520
<i>(O'Neill) Ouch!</i>

33:00.600 --> 33:04.480
It would appear Ramius was attempting
to get to one of his ships.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.080
Sir, I think we still have a chance
to capture the warrior.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.160
How?

33:11.880 --> 33:13.880
<i>(jet engine)</i>

33:26.200 --> 33:28.680
<i>- Transport cycle complete.
- (O'Neill) Get him?</i>

33:28.760 --> 33:30.080
<i>(banging)</i>

33:30.160 --> 33:31.960
<i>- Got him.
- Good.</i>

33:32.040 --> 33:33.440
Indeed.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.400
<i>(whistles)</i>

33:40.480 --> 33:43.920
<i>Chino! José! Ven para acá.</i>

33:44.000 --> 33:45.640
Far enough!

33:45.720 --> 33:47.320
<i>Agárralo.</i>

33:48.200 --> 33:50.200
<i>Llévenselo.</i>

34:02.560 --> 34:07.640
I don't know what you expect but no one'll
pay anything for us. We're worth nothing.

34:07.720 --> 34:12.400
That is unfortunate for you
because if no one pays, you both die.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.400
- It's still unconscious?
- Not surprising,

34:26.480 --> 34:30.520
considering we voided the cargo bay
of life support once we got it on the ship.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.239
- It took ten minutes to pass out.
- I'm surprised it's even alive.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.719
<i>- It put up a hell of a fight, sir.
- (phone)</i>

34:38.600 --> 34:40.199
Hammond.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
Very well.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.360
Your prisoner is awake.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.600
<i>(growls)</i>

35:02.520 --> 35:05.000
Who do you serve? Hm?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.480
Speak!

35:07.560 --> 35:10.760
I serve Anubis.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.120
How were you created?

35:27.800 --> 35:29.600
<i>(groans)</i>

35:38.600 --> 35:42.200
I think it's safe to assume
they won't get any more out of him.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.080
Found anything else?

35:44.160 --> 35:47.280
Initial scans indicate
below-normal brain-wave patterns

35:47.360 --> 35:50.000
emanating from both
the symbiote and the host.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.400
He has the strength and healing powers
of a normal Goa'uld,

35:53.480 --> 35:56.080
but none of the normal personality traits.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.880
The Goa'uld use sophisticated
brainwashing techniques.

35:59.960 --> 36:04.000
I'm open to suggestions. How can we
find out what it knows, if anything?

36:04.080 --> 36:08.000
There is one possibility. We may
be able to use a memory-recall device

36:08.080 --> 36:12.600
to access any conscious images
in its mind as it thinks them.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.360
Do it.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.280
Sir?

36:28.360 --> 36:30.360
- Any word from Daniel?
- No.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.320
He is now six hours overdue
per his regular contact schedule.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.440
That's late, even for Daniel.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.920
The Honduran government
is looking into it.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.960
They've sent some people to their last
reported location, but found nothing.

36:46.960 --> 36:50.240
If his brain waves
are compatible with the device,

36:50.320 --> 36:54.960
we should be able to see
whatever he's thinking holographically.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.680
What is your planet of origin?

37:25.960 --> 37:28.000
That's the sky above his planet.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.880
I don't recognise these star
configurations. It could be anywhere.

37:31.960 --> 37:39.000
We have technology that should be able
to pinpoint this location in the galaxy.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.680
He just gave us his home world.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.840
<i>¿Listos?</i>

38:07.600 --> 38:10.880
I know it's not much,
but we do what we can.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.640
So...

38:27.720 --> 38:30.440
Here's my proposal for you.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.960
I will ask questions, you give me answers.

38:33.040 --> 38:39.720
I believe you, you get more water,
food, maybe even a blanket at night.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.600
OK?

38:42.600 --> 38:44.400
OK.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.560
Who do you work for?

38:47.640 --> 38:52.600
- I told you. We're archaeologists...
- Maybe I was not so clear.

38:52.680 --> 38:57.880
If I don't believe you,
things get worse for you. Much worse.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.120
You kill us, you get nothing.

39:02.920 --> 39:07.120
Maybe I kill one of you
to get your government's attention.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.120
Who lives?

39:11.200 --> 39:13.320
Who dies?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.800
That's up to you.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.800
OK, you listen to me.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.600
What you're doing now is a big mistake.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.400
People, very powerful people,
are gonna come for us

39:25.480 --> 39:31.840
and, well, let's just say by letting us go
now, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.080
OK.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.640
We do it the hard way.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.320
Understand this:

39:49.400 --> 39:53.680
I will not hesitate to kill you both, make
an example of you for your government,

39:53.760 --> 39:57.440
so the next time
they will take us seriously.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.520
You should know,
many prisoners talk as you do:

40:04.600 --> 40:07.040
"My friends will come and save me."

40:07.640 --> 40:09.760

The Tok'ra call it Tartarus -

40:34.200 --> 40:37.760

in Goa'uld-controlled space.

40:37.840 --> 40:42.960
The Tok'ra are currently trying to assess
any defences that might be there.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.640

40:45.600 --> 40:48.080

40:48.160 --> 40:52.240

from the State Department in Washington.

40:52.320 --> 40:58.200

and Dr Lee have been kidnapped.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.880
