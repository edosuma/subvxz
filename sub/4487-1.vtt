02:40.723 --> 02:44.101
- Is this too fast?
- Harder!

02:53.361 --> 02:55.613
My sisters and I remember
that winter...

02:55.821 --> 02:58.449
...as the coldest of our childhood.

02:58.657 --> 03:01.994
A temporary poverty had settled
upon our family some years before.

03:03.412 --> 03:06.624
The war had made fuel
and lamp oil scarce...

03:06.832 --> 03:09.960
...but necessity is indeed
the mother of invention.

03:10.169 --> 03:12.213
Somehow in that dark time...

03:12.421 --> 03:15.091
...our family, the March family...

03:15.299 --> 03:17.676
...seemed lo create its own light.

03:17.885 --> 03:20.054
Marmee! Marmee's home!

03:27.478 --> 03:29.480
- Marmee!
- Marmee!

03:29.688 --> 03:30.731
We waited and waited!

03:30.940 --> 03:33.526
We've been expectorating
you for hours!

03:33.734 --> 03:37.113
- Have you, my darling?
-"Expecting," featherhead.

03:37.321 --> 03:39.323
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen.
- Yes.

03:39.532 --> 03:42.493
If you could see the people lined up
outside Hope House in this bitter cold.

03:42.701 --> 03:44.829
Your cheeks are so warm.
Thank you, Cricket.

03:45.037 --> 03:46.580
Are you finished
the Christmas bundles?

03:46.789 --> 03:48.958
So many this year.
We were handing out--

03:49.166 --> 03:50.918
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.

03:51.127 --> 03:55.423
Good. We were handing out food as
quickly as we could make up the baskets.

03:55.631 --> 04:00.010
- Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
- Father!

04:09.603 --> 04:12.815
"My dearest family, I am well and safe.

04:13.023 --> 04:15.067
Our battalion is encamped
on the Potomac."

04:15.276 --> 04:18.154
- Potomac.
- Potomac.

04:18.362 --> 04:22.700
"December makes a hard, cold
season for all of us so far from home.

04:22.908 --> 04:24.577
I think of my girls day and night...

04:24.743 --> 04:27.329
...and find my best comfort
in your affection.

04:27.538 --> 04:31.125
I pray that your own hardships
will not be too great to bear.

04:31.333 --> 04:34.545
Give them all my dear love
and a kiss.

04:34.753 --> 04:37.923
Tell them I think of them by day,
pray for them by night."

04:38.132 --> 04:42.803
- Poor father.
- I'm a selfish girl.

04:43.637 --> 04:44.680
Little ones.

04:46.390 --> 04:49.685
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.

05:10.414 --> 05:13.000
To bed, Miss Amy.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

05:13.209 --> 05:15.377
Merry Christmas.

05:18.756 --> 05:22.176
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

05:26.138 --> 05:27.306
Merry Christmas, Beth.

05:27.515 --> 05:29.934
- Love you.
- I love you.

05:32.811 --> 05:38.234
- My Jo. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Marmee.

05:41.529 --> 05:43.531
And don't sit up too late.

05:43.739 --> 05:44.865
I won't.

06:06.762 --> 06:10.474
Late at night, my mind would come alive
with voices and stories...

06:10.683 --> 06:14.270
...and friends as dear to me
as any in the real world.

06:14.478 --> 06:19.358
I gave myself up to it
longing for transformation.

06:23.696 --> 06:26.198
Oh, what miraculous food.

06:26.407 --> 06:29.827
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?

06:32.121 --> 06:34.206
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.

06:34.415 --> 06:35.791
I'm going to eat it.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.211
Jo? Jo, come down.

06:46.802 --> 06:50.639
I'm awake! Horrible piano.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.602
Hannah's put together
an absolute Christmas miracle.

06:54.810 --> 06:57.354
Is that sausage?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.149
Wait.

07:01.650 --> 07:05.779
Butter! Oh, isn't butter divinity?

07:05.988 --> 07:07.615
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.

07:07.823 --> 07:09.950
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.

07:10.159 --> 07:13.454
She went out at the crack of dawn
to see some Germans.

07:13.662 --> 07:17.124
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.

07:17.333 --> 07:22.379
His da's gone. Six children,
and she's about to issue another.

07:22.588 --> 07:24.590
May as well take them
a stick of firewood.

07:24.798 --> 07:26.050
Sure they haven't got any.

07:26.550 --> 07:29.178
Or breakfast either.

07:29.386 --> 07:32.389
Perhaps we could send
the Hummels our bread.

07:35.809 --> 07:38.979
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use...

07:39.188 --> 07:41.565
...without bread to put it on.

07:57.665 --> 07:59.541
Oh, wonderful snow.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.544
Don't you wish you could
roll about in it like dogs?

08:02.753 --> 08:06.131
Once one of our finest families.

08:12.304 --> 08:14.264
Lovely weather for a picnic!

08:14.473 --> 08:17.476
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.

08:22.981 --> 08:27.861
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?

08:28.070 --> 08:29.863
Oh, don't look back.

09:02.521 --> 09:06.483
"Knights and ladies, elves and pages,
monks and flower girls...

09:06.692 --> 09:08.986
...all mingled gaily in the dance.

09:09.194 --> 09:13.532
Pauline cried out in horror
as her bridegroom's mask fell...

09:13.741 --> 09:16.118
...disclosing not her lover, Ferdinand...

09:16.326 --> 09:20.456
...but the face of his sworn enemy,
Count Antonio.

09:21.790 --> 09:26.128
'Revenge is mine," quoth he."

09:28.630 --> 09:31.300
Continued in the following edition.

09:31.508 --> 09:34.428
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.

09:38.682 --> 09:41.518
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages.
- You ought to publish it, Jo.

09:41.685 --> 09:43.979
Really. Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.

09:44.188 --> 09:46.440
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning
our fine newspaper?

09:46.607 --> 09:48.692
Mr. Winkle.

09:50.152 --> 09:53.322
"One periwink-- Advertisement."

09:54.782 --> 09:57.868
"One periwinkle sash
belonging to Mr. N. Winkle...

09:58.076 --> 10:00.996
...has been abscondated
from the wash line...

10:01.205 --> 10:01.622
...which gentleman desires
any reports leading to its recovery."

10:01.622 --> 10:05.250
...which gentleman desires
any reports leading to its recovery."

10:10.130 --> 10:14.301
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear.
I call to your attention...

10:14.510 --> 10:16.178
...our Mr. Tupman's
"The History of the Squash.”

10:16.386 --> 10:19.973
- Oh, don't read mine.
- Beth, this isn't a story. It's a recipe.

10:20.182 --> 10:21.934
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.

10:22.142 --> 10:27.022
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman,
is never write what you know.

10:28.273 --> 10:30.943
What do we think of the boy?

10:31.151 --> 10:35.447
Is he a captive like Smee
in Nicholas Nickleby?

10:35.656 --> 10:38.867
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?

10:39.076 --> 10:43.622
Maybe he has a secret.
A tragic, European secret.

10:43.831 --> 10:46.083
He's had no upbringing at all, they say.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.961
He was reared in Italy
among artists and vagrants.

10:49.169 --> 10:51.338
Doesn't he have a noble brow?

10:51.547 --> 10:54.132
If I were a boy,
I'd wanna look just like that.

10:54.341 --> 10:57.177
Imagine giving up Italy
to come live with that awful old man.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.638
Oh, Jo, please don't say "awful."
It's slang.

10:59.847 --> 11:01.849
I'd be terrified to live with him.

11:04.142 --> 11:08.480
I shouldn't mind living in such
a fine house, and having nice things.

11:08.689 --> 11:11.900
Oh, it doesn't seem
like Christmas this year without presents.

11:13.527 --> 11:16.822
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.

11:17.322 --> 11:22.244
I wish I didn't have to work for
Great-Aunt March, that crabby old miser.

11:22.452 --> 11:25.080
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?

11:25.289 --> 11:29.251
I'd like the war to end
so father can come home.

11:29.459 --> 11:33.171
Oh, sweet Beth. We all want that.

11:34.256 --> 11:36.174
They do have a beautiful piano.

11:36.383 --> 11:40.178
Wait till I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.

11:40.387 --> 11:43.098
And if she doesn't,
you can come over and play mine.

11:43.307 --> 11:45.976
When I marry,
I'm going to be disgustingly rich.

11:46.184 --> 11:49.980
And what if the man you love
is a poor man, but good like father?

11:50.188 --> 11:54.151
Well, it isn't like being stuck
with the dreadful nose you get.

11:54.359 --> 11:56.528
One does have a choice
to whom one loves.

11:56.737 --> 11:58.322
You have a lovely nose.

11:58.530 --> 12:00.532
Well, I wouldn't marry for the money.

12:00.741 --> 12:03.452
I mean, what if his business goes bust?

12:03.660 --> 12:07.748
Besides, down at the Eagle,
they pay $5 for each story they print.

12:07.956 --> 12:10.542
Why, I have ten stories
in my head right now.

12:10.751 --> 12:15.088
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.

12:15.297 --> 12:19.217
Well, if lack of attention to personal
finances is a mark of refinement...

12:19.426 --> 12:23.722
...then I'd say the Marches
are the most elegant family in Concord.

12:24.848 --> 12:27.017
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.

12:27.225 --> 12:29.978
We might as well know what we want.

12:31.521 --> 12:35.359
That'll do, that'll do. Put the carriage
away, and look smart about it.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.319
Very good, sir.

12:38.654 --> 12:39.863
Merry Christmas.

12:42.324 --> 12:44.534
I have the most wonderful feeling
about tonight.

12:44.743 --> 12:48.664
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me
everything about Belle Gardiner.

12:48.872 --> 12:50.624
What her nose looks like
and about her ring.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.250
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.

12:52.459 --> 12:55.087
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.

12:55.253 --> 12:58.548
I'm glad I don't have to go
and be with all those frightening people...

12:58.757 --> 13:01.551
-...and try to think of things to say.
- Hush now.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.262
Oh, mind you, Jo,
don't eat much at supper.

13:04.471 --> 13:06.890
And don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.

13:07.099 --> 13:10.018
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!

13:10.227 --> 13:12.771
You always stand too close to the fire.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.774
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.

13:15.983 --> 13:18.360
Meg, look. What cunning little heels.

13:18.568 --> 13:22.739
- They're rather small.
- That's all right. It's only for one night.

13:22.948 --> 13:25.701
You don't suppose anyone will notice
they came out of the rag bag, do you?

13:26.994 --> 13:28.286
You have to have heels.

13:30.998 --> 13:32.499
What's that strange smell?

13:34.626 --> 13:36.461
Like burnt feathers.

13:42.968 --> 13:45.595
- Heavens above.
- You've ruined me.

13:45.804 --> 13:49.975
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it.

13:50.183 --> 13:53.270
- Meg, don't worry. It'll grow back.
- I spoil everything.

13:54.146 --> 13:55.856
I can't go out like this.

13:56.064 --> 13:58.025
Well, good! I'm not going either.

13:58.233 --> 14:01.236
Here, we'll place my bow in front.

14:02.404 --> 14:05.115
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming, Meg.

14:05.323 --> 14:09.828
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.

14:10.037 --> 14:15.000
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.127
Listen to the child.

14:17.335 --> 14:20.922
Meg isn't going to
be married right away, is she?

14:21.131 --> 14:23.800
With Jo's help, I never will.

14:26.428 --> 14:30.849
- Oh, you must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.

14:32.225 --> 14:36.271
Well, I best go and help Mama.
Excuse me.

14:47.532 --> 14:51.119
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.

14:51.703 --> 14:53.371
She's going to try it. Watch her.

15:14.601 --> 15:19.481
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
That's very kind.

15:29.366 --> 15:30.742
Jehoshaphat! I'm sorry.

15:30.951 --> 15:34.538
No, no, stay.
It's not a bad hiding place, is it?

15:34.746 --> 15:36.206
You see, I don't know anyone...

15:36.373 --> 15:38.792
...So I feel awkward
just standing and staring at people.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.462
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.

15:43.255 --> 15:44.923
I'm Laurie.

15:45.132 --> 15:48.135
Theodore Laurence,
but I'm called Laurie.

15:48.343 --> 15:50.345
Jo March.

15:51.721 --> 15:54.141
So who were you staring at?

15:54.349 --> 15:58.311
You, actually.
What game were you playing?

15:58.520 --> 16:01.189
I don't know, but I think I won.

16:01.398 --> 16:05.235
- Who else?
- Well, I was--

16:05.569 --> 16:07.863
I was quite taken with that one.

16:12.659 --> 16:16.454
That's Meg. That's my sister.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.376
She's completely bald in front.

16:22.460 --> 16:26.089
Is it true that you lived in Italy
among artists and vagrants?

16:26.298 --> 16:31.178
Well, my mother was Italian. A pianist.

16:33.221 --> 16:35.765
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?

16:35.974 --> 16:39.060
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?

16:39.269 --> 16:41.354
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?

16:41.563 --> 16:44.858
Where? In-- In Italy.

16:45.066 --> 16:47.736
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.

16:48.862 --> 16:51.698
The music conservatory in Vevey.

16:51.907 --> 16:53.366
But grandfather's having me tutored now.

16:53.575 --> 16:59.748
- He insists I go to college.
- Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.127
Actually, I'm going to Europe.

17:04.336 --> 17:08.798
Well, at least I hope I am. My Great-Aunt
March says she'll go one of these days...

17:09.007 --> 17:12.176
...and she has to take me with her
because I work as her companion.

17:12.385 --> 17:15.722
I have to read to her for hours and hours.

17:15.931 --> 17:19.184
- But I do all the voices.
- I'll bet you do.

17:19.392 --> 17:24.396
If I weren't going to be a writer,
I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.

17:24.606 --> 17:28.318
- Are you shocked?
- Very.

17:37.202 --> 17:38.828
Sorry.

17:53.551 --> 17:57.389
I'm sorry. Meg always makes me
take the gentleman's part at home.

17:57.597 --> 18:00.141
It's a shame you don't know
the lady's part.

18:02.018 --> 18:03.937
Are you looking
at the back of my dress, you cheat?

18:04.145 --> 18:06.106
It doesn't look so bad. Honestly.

18:06.314 --> 18:08.608
You promised you wouldn't look.

18:08.817 --> 18:10.944
Oh, Jo. Jo, I've sprained my ankle.

18:11.152 --> 18:13.488
I shouldn't wonder, in those shoes.
Does it hurt?

18:13.655 --> 18:15.949
Oh, no, no. I'm quite well, thank you.

18:16.157 --> 18:19.828
Well, this is our neighbor,
Laurie, the captive.

18:20.203 --> 18:22.163
Oh, poor Meg. I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.

18:22.372 --> 18:24.958
Oh, no, Jo. She'll think
I've been sampling the punch.

18:25.166 --> 18:28.586
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- Well, I have my carriage.

18:28.795 --> 18:29.963
- Let me take you home.
- Oh, yes!

18:30.171 --> 18:31.965
Oh, no, thank you.

18:35.427 --> 18:36.970
Thank you.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.981
Here, lean on me. Thank you,
Mr. Laurence. That's very kind of you.

18:48.148 --> 18:49.524
- Not at all.
- Goodbye, Laurie.

18:49.691 --> 18:53.194
- Good night, Mrs. March.
- Meg, wherever did you get this shoe?

18:54.696 --> 18:58.033
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.

18:58.241 --> 19:01.870
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest.

19:02.078 --> 19:05.206
Well, we're very much obliged to him,
but he's a dreadful boy.

19:05.415 --> 19:08.001
Well, he did a good deed
putting snow on this ankle.

19:08.209 --> 19:12.630
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.

19:12.839 --> 19:15.967
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.

19:16.176 --> 19:21.306
I won't have my girls
being silly about boys. To bed. Jo, dear.

19:21.514 --> 19:24.267
Does this hurt?

19:24.476 --> 19:27.145
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!

19:27.354 --> 19:29.856
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie
any more than you should be soppy...

19:30.065 --> 19:31.775
...about those silly girls at school.

19:31.941 --> 19:34.444
- I hope we shall be good friends with him.
- With a boy?

19:34.611 --> 19:37.739
He isn't a boy. He's Laurie.

19:40.158 --> 19:43.370
Faster!

19:46.664 --> 19:49.209
Faster!

19:49.417 --> 19:51.086
Faster!

19:51.294 --> 19:52.879
Laurie!

19:59.427 --> 20:02.222
Your young ladies are unusually active,
Mrs. March, if I may say so.

20:02.222 --> 20:03.390
Your young ladies are unusually active,
Mrs. March, if I may say so.

20:03.598 --> 20:05.934
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.

20:06.142 --> 20:08.311
It's my opinion that young girls
are no different than boys...

20:08.520 --> 20:09.604
...in their need for exertion.

20:09.813 --> 20:12.440
Feminine weakness
and fainting spells are the direct result...

20:12.649 --> 20:14.317
...of our confining young girls
to the house...

20:14.526 --> 20:17.779
...bent over their needlework
in restrictive corsets.

20:20.156 --> 20:22.367
Marmee.

20:22.867 --> 20:27.288
- Laurie.
- Your young student is an athlete.

20:28.415 --> 20:30.708
He is, thank you, a good one.

20:30.917 --> 20:33.211
But he makes an unruly scholar.

20:33.420 --> 20:36.131
I regret that his grandfather
is away much.

20:37.924 --> 20:41.177
One hopes that your girls
will be a gentling influence.

20:41.386 --> 20:43.638
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.

20:45.181 --> 20:49.436
Marmee, must you speak
to everyone about corsets?

20:49.644 --> 20:51.271
Oh, Meg.

20:51.479 --> 20:53.314
Do 1?

20:57.569 --> 21:00.822
Blast these wretched skirts!

21:01.322 --> 21:03.158
Don't say "blast” and "wretch."

21:03.366 --> 21:06.536
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.

21:06.744 --> 21:09.831
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home
and do pleasant things.

21:10.039 --> 21:13.918
Oh, if you call doing laundry
and housework pleasant.

21:14.335 --> 21:16.087
Blast.

21:16.296 --> 21:19.299
Amy, hurry. I'll be late for work.

21:20.300 --> 21:24.095
There's Mrs. King. I'm tardy again.

21:26.514 --> 21:28.349
Lovely children.

21:28.558 --> 21:32.395
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so degradatated.

21:32.604 --> 21:35.648
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.

21:35.857 --> 21:37.859
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?

21:38.067 --> 21:40.487
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.

21:40.695 --> 21:43.698
Everyone keeps them in their desks,
and trades them for beads and things.

21:43.907 --> 21:45.742
And all the girls treat each other
at recess.

21:45.950 --> 21:49.621
If you don't bring limes to school, you're
nothing. You might as well be dead.

21:49.829 --> 21:52.540
I've had ever so many limes,
and I can't pay anyone back.

21:52.749 --> 21:55.710
Well, no wonder you don't learn
anything at that school.

21:55.919 --> 21:58.296
I know how it feels to do
without any little luxuries.

21:58.505 --> 21:59.547
Meg!

21:59.756 --> 22:01.883
But we are not destitute, not yet.

22:02.091 --> 22:05.970
Here's a quarter. Marmee gave me
the rag money this month.

22:06.888 --> 22:08.431
Go on.

22:14.604 --> 22:19.609
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul...

22:19.817 --> 22:22.737
...Is asserted to be in consequence...

22:22.946 --> 22:25.240
...of its immateriality...

22:25.448 --> 22:28.576
...as in all leipothymic cases...

22:28.785 --> 22:33.998
...consistent with the idea of immortality...

22:34.207 --> 22:38.878
...and immorality, and physicality..."

22:39.087 --> 22:45.718
And I think you finally dozed off.

23:13.705 --> 23:16.874
Josephine, there's a draft!

23:26.801 --> 23:29.095
Is it father?

23:32.557 --> 23:34.309
Teacher struck me.

23:34.517 --> 23:37.645
He put the limes out into the snow.

23:41.190 --> 23:44.736
May Chester said my limes must
have been donated to Hope House.

23:44.944 --> 23:48.948
And then I said that she wouldn't
get a single lime from me.

23:49.157 --> 23:51.951
And then she told Mr. Davis
they were hidden in my desk...

23:52.160 --> 23:53.661
...and then he struck me.

23:53.870 --> 23:56.998
We ought to go over there and beat
the tar out of him with his own stick!

23:57.206 --> 24:00.501
Jo, we must not embrace violence.

24:00.710 --> 24:05.048
- No, I will write this man a letter.
- A letter? That'll show him.

24:05.423 --> 24:07.675
You failed to mention to me
they were forbidden.

24:07.842 --> 24:09.552
A whole month's rag money?

24:09.761 --> 24:14.015
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry.

24:14.223 --> 24:17.852
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly desolated.

24:18.061 --> 24:19.854
Well, I'm not sorry you lost them.

24:20.063 --> 24:21.814
It's a frivolous concern
in times like these.

24:22.023 --> 24:24.233
You are more intent upon reshaping
your dear little nose...

24:24.442 --> 24:26.569
...than in fashioning your character.

24:26.778 --> 24:28.946
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious...

24:29.155 --> 24:30.698
...your Latin absurd.

24:30.907 --> 24:35.787
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate
a woman as to educate a female cat.

24:38.122 --> 24:42.377
I really must strangle Mr. Davis.

24:43.044 --> 24:46.047
"Mr. Davis.

24:46.255 --> 24:48.049
What right have you to strike a child?

24:48.257 --> 24:51.427
In God's eyes, we are all children
and we are all equals.

24:51.594 --> 24:55.181
If you hit and humiliate a child,
the only lesson she will learn...

24:55.390 --> 24:57.517
...Is to hit and humiliate."

24:58.726 --> 25:02.105
Amy, do you think you can
discipline yourself...

25:02.313 --> 25:04.023
...to learn at home as Beth has done?

25:08.027 --> 25:10.321
"I withdraw my daughter Amy
from your school.”

25:10.530 --> 25:11.906
It serves the scoundrel right.

25:12.073 --> 25:15.159
Jo will now supervise your education.

25:24.877 --> 25:27.046
Jo, tell me what happens next...

25:27.255 --> 25:31.843
...after the duke turns his back on
his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.

25:32.051 --> 25:35.763
Don't know. It's all murder and gore.

25:35.972 --> 25:40.351
- The damsel's in distress.
- Oh, I love your damsels in distress.

25:40.560 --> 25:45.940
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know
if I could ever be good like Marmee.

25:46.441 --> 25:49.986
I rather crave violence.

25:50.445 --> 25:52.071
If only I could be like Father...

25:52.280 --> 25:57.535
...and go to war and stand up
to the lions of injustice.

25:57.744 --> 26:00.538
And so Marmee does
in her own way.

26:00.747 --> 26:02.540
Yes.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.085
But I want to do something different.

26:06.377 --> 26:10.006
I don't know what it is yet,
but I'm on the watch for it.

26:10.214 --> 26:12.592
You will find it, Jo.

26:21.934 --> 26:23.811
Hello! Jo!

26:24.020 --> 26:28.024
Come over here. You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.

26:28.232 --> 26:31.861
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies
as if they were cattle.

26:39.535 --> 26:40.870
My apologies!

26:51.506 --> 26:53.174
All right.

27:05.311 --> 27:08.105
What do those girls do
over there all day?

27:08.314 --> 27:10.733
Over the mysteries of female life...

27:10.942 --> 27:15.363
...there is drawn a veil
best left undisturbed.

27:40.680 --> 27:44.016
Oh, dear countess, pray for me...

27:44.225 --> 27:47.812
...for I have sinned against meself
and me brother Rodrigo.

27:48.020 --> 27:51.566
You've got to say "sinned"
as if you've really sinned.

27:51.774 --> 27:54.694
Sinned. Sinned.

27:55.528 --> 27:57.071
Rodrigo.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.449
You arrive seeking
the Duke of Lankershire.

28:01.158 --> 28:03.619
Hark ye. Who goes there?

28:03.828 --> 28:05.538
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.

28:05.746 --> 28:09.709
Why it's-- It's Rodrigo!

28:10.418 --> 28:14.463
- Rodrigo.
- I want to be Lady Violet.

28:14.672 --> 28:17.842
I'm exhaustified of being the boy.

28:18.050 --> 28:22.471
The play is the thing, Amy.
You're too little to be Lady Violet.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.682
Here,
be the Countess de Montanescu.

28:24.891 --> 28:29.186
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides, who would be our Rodrigo?

28:31.939 --> 28:33.774
Gentlemen...

28:35.401 --> 28:40.197
...propose the admission
of a new member to our theatrical society.

28:40.406 --> 28:42.408
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.

28:42.575 --> 28:45.912
Nay. He'll laugh at our acting,
and poke fun at us later.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.455
He'll think it's only a game.

28:47.663 --> 28:49.749
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.

28:49.957 --> 28:53.586
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard
our conduct in the same way.

28:53.794 --> 28:56.797
We bear our souls and tell
the most appalling secrets.

28:57.006 --> 28:58.215
He would find us improper.

28:58.382 --> 29:01.552
Oh, Teddy would do nothing of the sort.

29:02.386 --> 29:04.555
Oh, please. Let's try him.

29:04.764 --> 29:06.557
Shall we?

29:08.935 --> 29:10.019
- Jo!
- Jo, you traitor!

29:10.227 --> 29:13.940
Fellow artists, may I present myself...

29:14.148 --> 29:17.318
...as an actor, a musician, and a loyal...

29:17.526 --> 29:21.530
-...and very humble servant of the club.
- We'll be the judge of that.

29:21.739 --> 29:25.159
In token of my gratitude,
and as a means of promoting...

29:25.368 --> 29:27.578
...communication between
adjoining nations...

29:27.787 --> 29:32.416
...shouting from windows being forbidden,
I shall provide...

29:33.209 --> 29:36.087
...a post office in our hedge...

29:36.295 --> 29:40.591
...to further encourage
the baring of our souls...

29:40.800 --> 29:44.095
...and the telling
of our most appalling secrets.

29:47.682 --> 29:49.266
I do pledge...

29:49.475 --> 29:53.354
...never to reveal
what I receive in confidence here.

29:57.692 --> 29:59.568
Well, then...

30:01.612 --> 30:02.822
...do take your place, Rodrigo.

30:02.822 --> 30:04.407
...do take your place, Rodrigo.

30:04.615 --> 30:08.160
Sir Rodrigo.

30:14.667 --> 30:18.713
And so Laurie was admitted
as an equal into our society...

30:18.921 --> 30:21.424
...and we March girls could enjoy
the daily novelty...

30:21.632 --> 30:25.219
...of having a real brother
of our very own.

30:29.098 --> 30:32.977
I want to go to the theater.
I never get to go anywhere.

30:33.185 --> 30:36.313
You're too little. Beth, where in tarnation
are Marmee's opera glasses?

30:36.522 --> 30:39.817
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.

30:40.026 --> 30:41.527
Please, can't I go?

30:41.736 --> 30:44.488
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie
only reserved four seats.

30:44.697 --> 30:45.740
Do I look too shabby?

30:45.948 --> 30:47.867
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg,
this isn't a coronation.

30:48.075 --> 30:51.537
It's just Laurie
and that awful Mr. Brooke.

30:51.746 --> 30:54.665
Jo, can't you ask Teddy
to get another ticket?

30:54.832 --> 30:56.042
No.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.085
You have a cold, dear. Rest your eyes.

30:58.294 --> 31:00.671
Evangeline and I will make
you some ginger tea.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.506
You're weeks behind in algebra.

31:02.715 --> 31:04.759
Now, I want you to do all the pages
that I've marked.

31:04.967 --> 31:07.386
I won't have a sister
who's a lazy ignoramus.

31:07.595 --> 31:10.264
And don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.

31:12.058 --> 31:13.601
Good night.

31:17.897 --> 31:20.691
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!

31:28.491 --> 31:29.950
Whoa, there.

31:34.205 --> 31:35.748
Thank you.

31:36.415 --> 31:40.294
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?

31:40.503 --> 31:42.254
If only I were the swooning type.

31:42.463 --> 31:45.424
If only I were the catching type.

31:45.633 --> 31:50.930
Young Laurence informs me that you are
an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.

31:52.056 --> 31:54.975
- Well, I... I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.

31:55.184 --> 31:59.063
I find it most pleasurable, myself.

31:59.271 --> 32:01.732
Though, I confess,
I'm distracted at the theater...

32:01.941 --> 32:05.111
...thinking of the peculiar lives
of the actors themselves.

32:05.319 --> 32:08.405
When one considers the immodesties
Mrs. Nell Watson suffers...

32:08.614 --> 32:11.784
...one wonders what sort of lady
would seek such a life.

32:11.992 --> 32:14.245
Meg is a sensational actress.

32:14.453 --> 32:17.123
We're always putting on
wild theatricals.

32:17.331 --> 32:20.251
Oh, it's just something that we play at.

32:21.127 --> 32:27.049
Well, as a matter of fact,
at school, I engaged in debating.

32:27.258 --> 32:32.221
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.

32:41.272 --> 32:44.608
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.

32:44.817 --> 32:46.443
It was a most delightful evening.

32:46.610 --> 32:51.282
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much. Good night.

32:51.490 --> 32:53.826
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.

32:57.788 --> 33:01.542
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.669
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm
if it's offered.

33:03.878 --> 33:07.006
How was the theater? Amusing?

33:07.631 --> 33:13.179
It was wonderful. I was absolutely
inspired by the love scene.

33:15.097 --> 33:18.684
You look flushed, Meg, dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?

33:23.480 --> 33:25.900
Still sulking?

33:36.660 --> 33:38.954
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?

33:39.163 --> 33:40.748
Beth.

33:52.051 --> 33:55.721
No. No. No.

33:59.975 --> 34:01.310
I didn't do it!

34:02.228 --> 34:05.981
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

34:06.190 --> 34:10.485
- Marmee, help me!
- I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me?

34:10.652 --> 34:12.362
- How could you do this to me?
- Marmee!

34:12.571 --> 34:14.031
- Marmee!
- Jo!

34:14.239 --> 34:16.408
- Jo, stop it. You're hurting her.
- Marmee!

34:16.617 --> 34:18.744
- Marmee!
- Jo! Jo! Let go of her!

34:18.953 --> 34:22.998
- What's happened? Jo. All right.
- I hate you! I hate you!

34:23.415 --> 34:25.251
No, Jo!

34:25.458 --> 34:27.920
Don't touch it. Let it go, sweetheart.

34:28.128 --> 34:30.214
Come, just let it go.

34:31.422 --> 34:34.342
You're dead! You're nothing!

34:34.717 --> 34:37.763
I never want to see you again!

34:48.315 --> 34:52.444
It is a very great loss,
and you have every right to be put out.

34:52.777 --> 34:55.030
But don't let the sun go down
upon your anger.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.243
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?

34:59.451 --> 35:02.079
I will never forgive her.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.961
I'm sorry, Jo.

35:32.151 --> 35:34.778
Looks like the last ice
we'll have this year.

35:36.447 --> 35:37.614
Say "go."

35:37.823 --> 35:41.076
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!

35:41.285 --> 35:43.162
Ignore her.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.831
Ready-- Blast!

35:47.624 --> 35:49.335
You cheat!

35:52.755 --> 35:54.923
Jo, please.

36:14.485 --> 36:16.153
- Jo!
- Amy!

36:16.362 --> 36:20.616
- Jo!
- Hold on! I'm coming!

36:24.119 --> 36:25.579
Hold on, Amy.

36:28.207 --> 36:29.958
Get a rail!

36:34.213 --> 36:36.215
Grab the stick, Amy.

36:37.591 --> 36:39.093
- Grab it!
- Come on!

36:42.846 --> 36:44.556
- Hold on!
- Hold on. Hold on.

36:51.563 --> 36:54.566
- There we go. That's it, that's it.
- All right.

36:54.775 --> 36:55.818
There we go.

36:57.569 --> 37:00.406
Josephine March, you walked
all the way from Walden Pond...

37:00.614 --> 37:04.243
-...in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.

37:04.451 --> 37:07.871
- Dear Amy.
- How could I have been so horrible?

37:08.080 --> 37:09.206
Thank God for Laurie.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.918
Jo, do you love Laurie
more than you love me?

37:13.127 --> 37:14.711
Oh, don't be such a beetle.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.381
I could never love anyone
as I love my sisters.

37:17.589 --> 37:19.758
I'm not a beetle.

37:19.967 --> 37:22.302
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.

37:22.511 --> 37:25.431
When Lady Zara succumbs
to the duke's rival.

37:25.639 --> 37:27.099
Oh, right, yes.

37:27.307 --> 37:29.435
Sir Hugo.

37:29.810 --> 37:32.396
I quite prefer him, myself.

37:38.902 --> 37:41.405
In the spring, we turned
Orchard House upside down...

37:41.613 --> 37:45.742
...with preparations for Meg
to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.

37:45.951 --> 37:50.247
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung
by the neck than attend a fancy ball.

37:50.456 --> 37:53.250
Wait till all of Boston
sees you in this dress, Meg.

37:53.459 --> 37:55.294
I told Laurie he has to show you off...

37:55.461 --> 37:58.172
...and keep you from being a wallflower
upon penalty of death.

37:58.380 --> 38:01.258
Oh, where is that miserable glove?

38:01.467 --> 38:05.929
Abigail, I shake my head
at the way you're managing Margaret.

38:06.138 --> 38:08.765
How is she to be married
without a proper debut?

38:08.974 --> 38:10.601
Now, auntie,
in our present circumstances--

38:10.809 --> 38:14.855
Your circumstances will not change
with your husband's return.

38:15.063 --> 38:19.735
My nephew is as foolish with money
as he is in his new philosophies.

38:20.527 --> 38:25.157
The one hope for your family
is for Margaret to marry well...

38:25.365 --> 38:28.202
...though I don't know
who marries governesses.

38:28.410 --> 38:29.703
Marmee!

38:29.912 --> 38:33.332
And this one has entirely ruined
her disposition with books.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.751
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?

38:35.959 --> 38:37.794
No. Meg's taking them to the Moffats'.

38:38.003 --> 38:40.964
Marmee, Meg's frantic. She lost her glove
and she only has one pair.

38:41.173 --> 38:44.718
Now, she cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.

38:44.927 --> 38:48.347
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.

38:49.681 --> 38:52.184
Meg, you can take Marmee's!

38:52.392 --> 38:54.061
Oh, dear.

38:56.730 --> 38:59.441
- More tea?
- No, thank you.

39:14.790 --> 39:19.127
Sally Moffat, you won't be able
to draw your laces.

39:19.336 --> 39:22.381
At my coming out party,
I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.

39:28.428 --> 39:31.098
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.

39:31.306 --> 39:33.684
It's just like forget-me-nots.

39:33.892 --> 39:37.062
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric
since the war broke out.

39:37.271 --> 39:40.190
But you had it made up so plain.

39:40.524 --> 39:43.694
Well, I do my own sewing, and--

39:43.902 --> 39:47.197
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street
carries silk pieces ready-made.

39:47.406 --> 39:50.867
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.

39:51.076 --> 39:53.537
They have views on slavery.

39:53.745 --> 39:56.039
Meg, isn't it true
that your father's school had to close...

39:56.248 --> 39:58.250
...when he admitted a little dark girl?

39:59.668 --> 40:01.628
The silk of Mrs. Finster's
isn't milled in the South.

40:01.837 --> 40:03.422
- It's made right here, over in Linfield.
- This isn't China silk?

40:03.422 --> 40:05.716
- It's made right here, over in Linfield.
- This isn't China silk?

40:05.924 --> 40:09.886
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.

40:11.388 --> 40:14.016
The poor are always with us.

40:14.224 --> 40:16.101
You are so good to remind us.

40:21.607 --> 40:23.859
May I tell you something?

40:24.526 --> 40:27.029
This is an afternoon dress.

40:27.529 --> 40:29.406
I'm going to make you my pet.

40:29.615 --> 40:31.700
Hortense?

40:34.870 --> 40:39.291
Tonight, Miss March shall
have as many conquests as she likes.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.919
You have no corset.

40:54.681 --> 40:56.141
Come on.

41:07.235 --> 41:08.403
- No, thank you.
- Yes, it's charming.

41:08.612 --> 41:11.990
- Not for me, thank you.
- Ibelieve the next dance is the polka.

41:12.199 --> 41:15.702
- With me.
- I would dance with you, Mr. Parker...

41:15.911 --> 41:17.746
...but I fear for my new slippers.

41:17.954 --> 41:21.458
My credo is, "Don't tread on me."

41:22.918 --> 41:27.714
Miss March. I thought your family
were temperance people.

41:27.923 --> 41:29.716
Laurie.

41:31.301 --> 41:34.554
- Oh, no.
- No, no, don't cover up.

41:34.763 --> 41:38.308
There may be one or two gentlemen here
who haven't seen all of your charms.

41:38.517 --> 41:41.645
And I did promise Jo
I would show you off.

41:41.853 --> 41:44.189
The girls dressed me up,
and I rather like it.

41:44.398 --> 41:48.318
Yes, well, it reveals a whole new Meg.

41:49.277 --> 41:51.154
What do you call this?

42:07.796 --> 42:09.256
Meg.

42:11.550 --> 42:13.343
I'm sorry.

42:14.678 --> 42:17.681
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.

42:17.889 --> 42:19.725
Of course not.

42:20.225 --> 42:23.395
If you won't tell anyone
how I've behaved.

42:23.603 --> 42:25.981
I was only playing a part...

42:26.189 --> 42:29.484
...to see how it felt
to be Belle Gardiner...

42:29.693 --> 42:32.612
...with four proposals
and 20 pairs of gloves.

42:32.821 --> 42:34.156
You're worth 10 of those other girls.

42:34.364 --> 42:37.701
Did you see the way this March girl
has gone after the Laurence heir?

42:37.909 --> 42:41.121
Best thing that could happen
to the Marches.

42:47.169 --> 42:48.378
This ridiculous dress.

42:48.587 --> 42:51.631
I've been tripping over it all night.

42:51.840 --> 42:56.219
Tie something around your neck
where it could do you some good.

42:58.054 --> 43:01.016
I don't like people speculating
about Laurie and our Meg...

43:01.224 --> 43:04.227
...as if they were characters
in some play.

43:04.436 --> 43:06.313
And nothing provokes
speculation more...

43:06.521 --> 43:09.649
...than the sight of a woman
enjoying herself.

43:09.941 --> 43:13.195
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes,
and flirt and tipple champagne--?

43:13.403 --> 43:15.906
And no one thinks the less of him?

43:16.114 --> 43:18.492
Well, I suppose
for one practical reason:

43:18.700 --> 43:21.661
Laurie is a man, and as such...

43:21.870 --> 43:25.832
...he may vote, and hold property
and pursue any profession he pleases.

43:26.041 --> 43:29.669
And so he is not so easily demeaned.

43:29.878 --> 43:32.798
Why should anyone care
what they think?

43:33.381 --> 43:35.091
I do.

43:35.509 --> 43:38.720
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.

43:38.929 --> 43:41.223
Of course not.

43:41.431 --> 43:44.351
I only care what you think of yourself.

43:44.559 --> 43:47.896
If you feel your value lies
in being merely decorative...

43:48.104 --> 43:49.940
...I fear that someday
you might find yourself...

43:50.148 --> 43:52.526
...believing that's all that you really are.

43:53.276 --> 43:57.697
Time erodes all such beauty.
But what it cannot diminish...

43:57.906 --> 44:00.575
...is the wonderful workings
of your mind.

44:00.784 --> 44:03.745
Your humor, your kindness...

44:03.954 --> 44:05.580
...and your moral courage.

44:05.789 --> 44:08.792
These are the things
I cherish so in you.

44:09.626 --> 44:13.463
I so wish I could give my girls
a more just world.

44:13.672 --> 44:16.132
I know you'll make it a better place.

44:26.726 --> 44:31.439
Resounded.
Resounded with song of the nightingale.

44:31.648 --> 44:33.275
With a gush--

44:34.276 --> 44:35.902
With a gush--

44:37.529 --> 44:38.780
No.

44:52.168 --> 44:54.045
No, I don't want them now.

44:54.254 --> 44:56.339
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.

44:56.548 --> 45:00.385
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.

45:00.594 --> 45:02.304
I could've sworn
there was another volume.

45:02.512 --> 45:06.975
Honestly, Jo. I won't be taking
all of Dickens to Harvard with me.

45:07.183 --> 45:11.146
Oh, no. You'll have
much more important things to read.

45:13.815 --> 45:16.401
Nothing's going to change, Jo.

45:16.860 --> 45:18.987
I wish I could go.

45:20.196 --> 45:22.032
I wish you could too.

45:23.116 --> 45:25.660
You'll come back knowing
all sorts of things I don't know...

45:25.869 --> 45:28.163
...and then I'll hate you.

45:30.999 --> 45:33.460
Well, as it happens...

45:33.668 --> 45:36.838
...I already know something
you don't know.

45:37.213 --> 45:41.885
About Meg
and a certain former tutor of mine...

45:42.093 --> 45:45.221
...soon to be employed at the firm
of Laurence and Laurence.

45:45.430 --> 45:46.556
Liar.

45:47.349 --> 45:51.186
Has Meg mislaid a certain
personal article...

45:51.394 --> 45:55.649
...such as a glove?

45:59.402 --> 46:02.572
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove.

46:02.781 --> 46:04.908
What glove? Not my white one?

46:05.116 --> 46:08.411
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.

46:08.620 --> 46:12.082
You must tell him to return it. Hannah,
don't you think he ought to give it back?

46:12.290 --> 46:14.668
It isn't what I think that matters.

46:14.876 --> 46:17.295
Jo? Meg?

46:19.506 --> 46:21.341
It's a telegram...

46:21.549 --> 46:23.885
...from Washington Hospital.

46:24.094 --> 46:26.429
Your father's been wounded.

46:33.228 --> 46:34.729
- Come on, Amy. That's it.
- There are six.

46:34.938 --> 46:36.356
The household account
is in this ledger.

46:36.564 --> 46:38.441
It should see you through
to the end of the month.

46:38.650 --> 46:40.527
- Of course. Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?

46:40.735 --> 46:42.362
Dear, look in on the Hummels for me,
will you?

46:42.570 --> 46:43.989
I will, Marmee.

46:44.197 --> 46:46.157
Where's Jo? It's almost 6.

46:46.366 --> 46:48.994
Doing battle with Aunt March
for Marmee's railway ticket.

46:49.160 --> 46:52.205
Amy, would you carry a letter
to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House.

46:52.414 --> 46:54.582
John. Mr. Brooke.

46:54.791 --> 46:58.086
I've come to offer myself
as an escort to your mother.

46:58.294 --> 47:01.131
Cook packed this up, and grandfather
sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.

47:01.339 --> 47:04.551
- Oh, that's lovely, Laurie. Thank you.
- Marmee.

47:05.260 --> 47:06.428
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.

47:06.636 --> 47:07.679
Mr. Brooke.

47:07.887 --> 47:09.597
As young Laurence no longer requires
a tutor...

47:09.806 --> 47:12.100
...Mr. Laurence has commissions
for me in Washington.

47:12.308 --> 47:14.394
I should like to be of service
to you there.

47:14.602 --> 47:17.772
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Oh, Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.

47:17.981 --> 47:20.400
- May 1?7 Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
- Thank you.

47:20.608 --> 47:23.236
- Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't re--
- I'm here!

47:23.445 --> 47:25.488
Jo. Finally.

47:25.697 --> 47:28.324
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?

47:28.533 --> 47:31.494
I couldn't bear to ask her.

47:31.703 --> 47:35.582
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?

47:35.790 --> 47:39.669
- Your one beauty.
- It won't affect the state of the union.

47:39.878 --> 47:42.422
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.

47:42.630 --> 47:44.257
Tell father that we love him.

47:45.967 --> 47:48.261
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.

47:48.470 --> 47:51.723
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Oh, Hannah, thank you.

47:56.811 --> 47:59.939
Oh, I shall miss my little women.

48:22.629 --> 48:25.507
Are you thinking about father?

48:26.883 --> 48:29.344
No. My hair.

48:44.109 --> 48:48.196
- Harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.244
Wait for me!

48:56.371 --> 48:58.832
Blast! Oh, dear.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.792
- This stove.
- We'll eat them anyway.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.669
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.

49:02.836 --> 49:05.672
The grocer won't let us have any more
on account.

49:06.422 --> 49:09.092
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels.

49:09.259 --> 49:11.678
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.

49:11.886 --> 49:14.013
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.

49:14.222 --> 49:18.143
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money.

49:21.437 --> 49:23.690
Your potatoes!

49:24.858 --> 49:27.110
Come on! Here!

49:27.318 --> 49:29.654
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.

49:29.863 --> 49:34.367
<i>- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- won't. I will. Go!</i>

49:50.592 --> 49:53.344
- Beth.
- Christine.

49:59.017 --> 50:03.188
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.

50:38.431 --> 50:41.267
Laurie's home for the weekend!
In need of funds, no doubt.

50:41.476 --> 50:45.188
We'd have a week's groceries
with what he spends on billiards.

50:46.814 --> 50:49.484
Oh, Jehoshaphat.

50:55.198 --> 50:57.533
Meg! Meg, you won't believe it!

50:57.742 --> 50:59.452
I've sold
The Lost Duke of Gloucester!

50:59.619 --> 51:00.870
Five whole dollars!

51:01.079 --> 51:02.872
I'm an author!

51:03.081 --> 51:04.624
Beth?

51:05.291 --> 51:07.418
The Hummel baby is sick.

51:10.713 --> 51:13.675
I feel so strange.

51:17.387 --> 51:20.306
She's burning up,
but she says that she's freezing.

51:20.515 --> 51:22.350
She has a terrible thirst,
but she won't drink.

51:22.558 --> 51:25.645
Sounds like Arsenicum,
but she looks more like belladonna.

51:25.853 --> 51:27.730
I saw the Hummels.

51:27.939 --> 51:30.900
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.

51:31.109 --> 51:32.819
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.

51:33.027 --> 51:34.612
You had it when you were babies.

51:34.821 --> 51:38.825
But, Miss Amy,
we have to send you away.

51:46.749 --> 51:48.793
She won't die.

51:49.460 --> 51:53.840
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.

51:55.508 --> 51:58.344
I don't wanna go away.

51:58.845 --> 52:01.097
I'll come and see you every day.

52:01.306 --> 52:04.350
I swear it. You won't be alone.

52:10.023 --> 52:12.150
I'm afraid of Aunt March.

52:14.902 --> 52:16.487
If she's unkind to you...

52:16.696 --> 52:21.409
-...I'll come and take you away.
- Where will we go?

52:22.910 --> 52:24.662
Paris?

52:28.541 --> 52:31.336
If I get scarlet fever and die...

52:31.544 --> 52:34.464
...give Meg my box
with the green doves on it.

52:34.672 --> 52:38.551
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.

52:39.677 --> 52:41.888
I don't wanna die.

52:43.014 --> 52:46.059
I've never even been kissed.

52:46.267 --> 52:48.978
I've waited my whole life
to be kissed.

52:49.187 --> 52:51.397
And what if I miss it?

52:51.606 --> 52:53.816
I tell you what.

52:54.359 --> 52:58.154
I promise to kiss you before you die.

53:20.510 --> 53:22.845
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave Father.

53:23.054 --> 53:25.014
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.

53:25.223 --> 53:27.642
But what if we send for her
and Father gets worse?

53:27.850 --> 53:31.646
How in the name of all that's holy
would we pay for the train?

53:33.189 --> 53:36.651
"That he profane not
my sancteraries--"

53:36.859 --> 53:40.321
- Sanctuary.
-"Sanctuaries.

53:40.530 --> 53:44.450
For I, the Lord,
do sanctify them.

53:44.659 --> 53:48.704
And Moses told it
unto Aaron and to his sons...

53:48.913 --> 53:52.417
...and unto all the children of Israel."

53:55.545 --> 53:57.296
Go on.

54:00.675 --> 54:03.386
"And the Lord spake
unto Moses saying--"

54:08.516 --> 54:11.394
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.

54:16.482 --> 54:20.361
If we may, I wish my personal physician,
Dr. Bangs...

54:20.570 --> 54:22.905
...to examine the little girl.

54:38.588 --> 54:40.131
There's nothing to be done.

54:40.339 --> 54:44.343
If I bleed her, it would finish her.

54:44.552 --> 54:47.680
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.

54:47.889 --> 54:51.851
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.

54:54.854 --> 54:56.689
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

54:56.898 --> 54:58.691
Blessed art thou
amongst women and bless--

55:02.987 --> 55:04.489
Jo!

55:08.701 --> 55:12.872
Cricket. Marmee's here.

55:17.543 --> 55:19.754
Icy cold. Jo.

55:20.838 --> 55:23.925
Jo, fetch a basin
with vinegar water and some rags.

55:24.133 --> 55:26.427
Meg, my kit.

55:26.636 --> 55:29.597
Must draw the fever down
from her head.

55:29.805 --> 55:31.891
It's all right.

55:32.099 --> 55:33.935
It's all right.

55:34.227 --> 55:37.897
It's all right now. That's my love.

56:10.096 --> 56:11.639
Beth.

56:42.211 --> 56:44.672
And so our dear Beth
came back to us...

56:44.880 --> 56:48.259
...although the fever
had weakened her heart forever.

56:48.467 --> 56:52.096
We did not know then
that a shadow had fallen.

56:52.555 --> 56:55.641
We prepared for another
Christmas without Father.

56:56.475 --> 56:58.269
Try each corner. Thank you.

56:58.477 --> 57:01.230
No, no! One bow is enough!

57:01.439 --> 57:04.066
Mr. Laurence. Thank you.

57:07.278 --> 57:10.072
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.

57:10.281 --> 57:11.824
How's this?

57:13.159 --> 57:14.785
- Here she comes.
- Come on. Come on.

57:14.952 --> 57:16.329
What should I do with these bows?

57:16.537 --> 57:18.664
Now, don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.

57:18.873 --> 57:21.959
Hide the chairs. Just hide them, Amy.

57:23.210 --> 57:25.046
Quick.

57:30.926 --> 57:33.512
The house is beautiful.

57:47.193 --> 57:48.611
They're friends of mine from college.

57:48.819 --> 57:51.572
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.

57:51.781 --> 57:53.824
They won't bite.

58:00.247 --> 58:01.582
No, don't sit there! Sit--

58:01.791 --> 58:05.503
Here. Sit here, child.

58:05.711 --> 58:07.880
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!

58:08.089 --> 58:11.050
Merry Christmas, Beth!

58:16.472 --> 58:19.850
I should've given it to you long ago.

58:21.060 --> 58:25.314
It belonged to my little girl
who had to leave us...

58:25.523 --> 58:27.650
...when she was very young.

58:27.858 --> 58:31.070
But now it will make music again.

58:41.706 --> 58:43.541
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.

58:45.459 --> 58:48.879
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

58:49.088 --> 58:50.715
Play something, Beth.

58:50.923 --> 58:52.717
Shall 1?

59:49.064 --> 59:51.442
That was good.

59:52.443 --> 59:54.987
I fear you would have
a long engagement.

59:55.196 --> 59:58.699
Three or four years. John must secure
a house before you can marry.

59:58.908 --> 01:00:02.828
- And he must do his service to the union.
- John? Marry?

01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:04.622
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?

01:00:04.622 --> 01:00:05.289
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?

01:00:05.498 --> 01:00:07.458
How did he weasel his way
into this family?

01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:09.043
Jo.

01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:11.921
John has been very kind to go
visit Father in the hospital every day.

01:00:12.129 --> 01:00:15.800
He's dull as powder. Meg, can't you
at least marry someone amusing?

01:00:16.008 --> 01:00:19.136
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man. He's kind and serious.

01:00:19.345 --> 01:00:21.639
And I'm not afraid of being poor.

01:00:21.847 --> 01:00:24.266
Marmee, you can't just
let her go and marry him.

01:00:24.475 --> 01:00:26.268
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.

01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:28.771
I would rather Meg marry for love
and be a poor man's wife...

01:00:28.979 --> 01:00:31.565
...than marry for riches
and lose her self-respect.

01:00:33.275 --> 01:00:35.569
So you don't mind that John is poor?

01:00:35.778 --> 01:00:38.864
No, but I would rather
he have a house.

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.784
Why must we marry at all?

01:00:41.992 --> 01:00:43.911
Why can't things just stay as they are?

01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:47.373
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided. Now, girls.

01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:49.583
Let's not spoil the day.

01:01:01.303 --> 01:01:02.805
Father? Father!

01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:06.058
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!

01:01:06.267 --> 01:01:10.229
Father! Oh, Father, you're home!

01:01:11.814 --> 01:01:13.357
Meg.

01:01:13.566 --> 01:01:17.611
- Oh, you're more handsome than ever.
- Beth, my little cricket.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.864
- Thank God you're well.
- Clear the way.

01:01:20.072 --> 01:01:22.825
- Give the man room to breathe.
- Jo!

01:01:23.033 --> 01:01:25.369
Oh, my wild girl!

01:01:26.245 --> 01:01:28.873
Well, this could become the fashion.

01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.709
- Watch his arm.
- I'm not used to this.

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:33.085
- Be careful.
- Be very careful now.

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:36.630
- Don't coddle this soldier too much.
- Oh, now, Father, it's time to coddle.

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:40.968
- Oh, Father!
- Hannah, God bless you.

01:01:41.176 --> 01:01:44.680
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to have you home, Mr. March.

01:01:44.889 --> 01:01:49.018
- Now, let me look at my girls.
- Take them and give them--

01:02:00.738 --> 01:02:03.365
The cholera took more men
than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.

01:02:03.574 --> 01:02:06.869
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.

01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:09.330
Perhaps the freedmen should
be given land in the west.

01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:10.998
What happened
between you and John Brooke?

01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:13.208
Never you mind.

01:02:16.545 --> 01:02:21.008
- Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
- Yes, it's wonderful.

01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:39.109
Welcome home, soldier.

01:02:39.318 --> 01:02:41.487
Would you like some water, sir?

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:15.521
Change will come...

01:03:15.729 --> 01:03:18.816
...as surely as the seasons
and twice as quick.

01:03:19.024 --> 01:03:21.568
We make our peace with it
as best we can.

01:03:21.777 --> 01:03:25.239
Or as Amy once said
when she was still a little girl:

01:03:25.447 --> 01:03:29.034
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want.”

01:03:55.019 --> 01:03:57.062
So you feel our Amy has talent?

01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:01.358
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing.

01:04:01.567 --> 01:04:05.446
But, you know,
her landscapes lack emotion.

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:10.284
I definitely feel Amy would benefit
from further study.

01:04:10.492 --> 01:04:12.369
But she won't get it around here.

01:04:12.578 --> 01:04:15.956
- Where do you suggest?
- Cape Cod has a fine artist colony.

01:04:16.165 --> 01:04:18.667
But Europe, Europe is the best place.

01:04:26.508 --> 01:04:29.636
Teddy! Teddy!

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:32.264
Your houseman said
you wouldn't be home till night.

01:04:32.473 --> 01:04:33.599
I couldn't wait so long.

01:04:33.766 --> 01:04:35.893
Hail the conquering graduate.

01:04:36.101 --> 01:04:38.937
- Is grandfather exceedingly proud?
- Yes.

01:04:39.146 --> 01:04:41.940
And exceedingly bent
on locking me up in one of his offices.

01:04:42.149 --> 01:04:45.611
Why is it Amy may paint China
and you can scribble away...

01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:49.323
...while I must manfully
set my music aside?

01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:51.575
Why must you?

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:56.121
If I don't, I'd have to defy grandfather.

01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:59.625
Yes, and not the whole of society.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.046
I can't go against the old man.

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:11.720
When I imagine myself in that life...

01:05:13.097 --> 01:05:15.599
<i>...can think of only one thing...</i>

01:05:15.808 --> 01:05:17.976
...that would make me happy.

01:05:20.312 --> 01:05:25.442
Oh, no. Teddy-- Teddy, don't.

01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:33.992
No, wait, Teddy.

01:05:34.201 --> 01:05:36.203
We have to talk about this reasonably.

01:05:36.411 --> 01:05:39.039
I have loved you...

01:05:39.248 --> 01:05:42.251
...since the moment
I clamped eyes on you.

01:05:42.459 --> 01:05:44.795
What could be more reasonable
than to marry you?

01:05:45.712 --> 01:05:47.798
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense!

01:05:48.006 --> 01:05:51.426
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can. Unless provoked.

01:05:51.635 --> 01:05:54.721
We're both stupidly stubborn,
especially you. We'd only quarrel.

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:56.640
I wouldn't!

01:05:56.849 --> 01:06:00.394
You can't even propose
without quarreling.

01:06:01.145 --> 01:06:02.604
Jo.

01:06:04.064 --> 01:06:08.610
Dear Jo. I swear I'll be a saint.

01:06:08.819 --> 01:06:12.239
I'll let you win every argument.

01:06:13.323 --> 01:06:17.202
I'll take care of you and your family.

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:19.538
I'll give you every luxury
you've ever been denied.

01:06:19.746 --> 01:06:22.958
You won't have to write.
Unless you want to.

01:06:23.167 --> 01:06:25.836
Grandfather...

01:06:26.044 --> 01:06:29.339
...wants me to learn the business
in England.

01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:31.967
Can't you see us
bashing around London?

01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:33.719
London.

01:06:33.927 --> 01:06:37.306
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough
for London.

01:06:37.514 --> 01:06:40.475
You need someone
who's elegant and refined.

01:06:40.684 --> 01:06:43.478
I want you.

01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:50.235
Teddy, please don't ask me.

01:06:57.034 --> 01:06:59.203
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No, don't.

01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:01.622
- I do care for you.
- No.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.208
With all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.004
I just can't go be a wife.

01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:14.551
You say you won't, but you will.

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:18.847
- I won't. I won't.
- One day...

01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:23.227
...you'll meet some man.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:25.145
A good man.

01:07:25.354 --> 01:07:28.607
And you will love him tremendously.

01:07:30.317 --> 01:07:34.071
And you will live and die for him.

01:07:34.279 --> 01:07:37.241
- Teddy, please.
- You will.

01:07:38.116 --> 01:07:39.743
Jo.

01:07:42.246 --> 01:07:44.081
I know you.

01:07:49.878 --> 01:07:52.005
And I'll be hanged...

01:07:52.214 --> 01:07:55.050
...if I stand by and watch.

01:08:15.153 --> 01:08:17.738
Jo, are you ill?

01:08:17.948 --> 01:08:20.242
She has refused Laurie.

01:08:21.576 --> 01:08:25.162
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.

01:08:25.372 --> 01:08:27.499
No.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.501
No.

01:08:32.337 --> 01:08:34.756
Oh, listen to him.

01:08:36.466 --> 01:08:38.385
I must get away.

01:08:38.593 --> 01:08:40.970
Of course.

01:08:43.724 --> 01:08:45.517
Aunt March is going to France.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.853
France!

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.897
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!

01:08:51.106 --> 01:08:52.733
Jo, Aunt March has asked me to go.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:55.861
To Europe?

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.531
My Europe?

01:09:03.368 --> 01:09:04.453
When?

01:09:05.287 --> 01:09:07.622
It was decided just today.

01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:18.508
Well, I am her companion now.

01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:22.386
She wishes me
to study painting abroad...

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:25.182
...and hopes I might make
a good match there.

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:33.607
But perhaps she wouldn't mind
if you stayed at Plumfield...

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.194
...while we are gone.

01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:45.911
Of course Aunt March prefers
Amy over me. Why shouldn't she?

01:09:46.118 --> 01:09:49.872
I'm ugly and awkward,
and I always say the wrong things.

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:54.336
I fly around throwing away
perfectly good marriage proposals.

01:09:54.544 --> 01:09:59.841
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful,
and I can't stand being here.

01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:05.222
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Marmee.

01:10:05.222 --> 01:10:05.806
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Marmee.

01:10:06.014 --> 01:10:08.517
There's just something
really wrong with me.

01:10:08.725 --> 01:10:11.686
I want to change, but I... I can't.

01:10:11.895 --> 01:10:17.484
- And I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
- Oh, Jo.

01:10:17.692 --> 01:10:21.154
Jo, you have so many
extraordinary gifts.

01:10:21.363 --> 01:10:25.742
How can you expect
to lead an ordinary life?

01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:30.789
You're ready to go out
and find a good use for your talent.

01:10:32.457 --> 01:10:36.294
Although, I don't know what I shall do
without my Jo.

01:10:38.338 --> 01:10:43.093
Go and embrace your liberty.

01:10:43.301 --> 01:10:46.638
And see what wonderful things
come of it.

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:17.294
Laurie sought his refuge
in London and abroad.

01:11:17.502 --> 01:11:21.173
Marmee helped me find a place
in the great city of New York.

01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:25.886
So I stepped over the divide between
childhood and all that lay beyond.

01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:29.639
Mrs. Kirk?

01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:32.767
Josephine.

01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:34.478
Yes. How do you do?

01:11:34.686 --> 01:11:38.106
Kitty, Minnie! This is Miss March.

01:11:38.315 --> 01:11:41.860
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.

01:11:42.068 --> 01:11:44.696
- It was cold!
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.

01:11:44.905 --> 01:11:47.949
- You never get it straight.
- Do come in, my dear.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.787
Dear Beth.

01:11:52.996 --> 01:11:56.750
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk,
has made me feel quite at home.

01:11:56.958 --> 01:12:01.046
My little students,
Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.

01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:08.678
How curious to grow up
in a busy boardinghouse with no father...

01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:11.806
...and your own mother the innkeeper.

01:12:12.891 --> 01:12:15.018
! felt bold on leaving Concord.

01:12:15.227 --> 01:12:18.230
But I confess I find New York
rough and strange...

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:20.774
...and myself strange in it.

01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:23.610
Can you pass these down the table?

01:12:23.818 --> 01:12:26.154
Thank you kindly, professor.

01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:34.579
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here
for a brief interlude...

01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:39.000
...of sensational experience
before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.

01:12:39.209 --> 01:12:40.252
Excuse me, miss.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.671
And while there's surely no lack
of sensational experience...

01:12:42.879 --> 01:12:44.965
<i>...of every kind
available in such a city...</i>

01:12:45.173 --> 01:12:46.216
Come in!

01:12:46.424 --> 01:12:48.343
...I hope, though I've had
no luck yet...

01:12:48.552 --> 01:12:51.471
...that any experience [ gain here
will be strictly literary.

01:12:53.098 --> 01:12:55.850
And that all events
of a romantic or sensational nature...

01:12:56.059 --> 01:12:58.687
...will be entirely confined to the page.

01:12:58.895 --> 01:13:02.774
Our subscribers are not interested
in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.

01:13:04.693 --> 01:13:06.736
They're not fairy stories.

01:13:06.945 --> 01:13:09.447
Try one of the ladies' magazines.

01:13:27.632 --> 01:13:30.719
- Come on, Will. Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:41.062
- I'm so sorry. I'm so clumsy.
- Oh, no. No.

01:13:47.402 --> 01:13:52.365
You know that when first I saw you,
I thought:

01:13:52.574 --> 01:13:55.785
"She is a writer."

01:13:55.994 --> 01:13:58.121
What made you think so?

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:08.757
Yes, I know many writers.

01:14:08.965 --> 01:14:11.217
In Berlin I was--

01:14:11.426 --> 01:14:14.554
I was professor at the university.

01:14:15.013 --> 01:14:20.310
Here, I am just a humble tutor,
I'm afraid.

01:14:21.603 --> 01:14:23.897
No, please. Sit down.

01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:27.108
Thank you.

01:14:39.996 --> 01:14:42.040
You are far from home, Miss March?

01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:44.376
Do you miss your family?

01:14:44.584 --> 01:14:46.378
Oh, very much.

01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:50.256
My sisters especially. And Laurie.

01:14:50.465 --> 01:14:52.592
She is your sister?

01:14:54.969 --> 01:14:57.972
No, no. He's a friend.

01:14:58.723 --> 01:15:00.266
Do you like your coffee?

01:15:00.475 --> 01:15:04.020
Oh, it's just very strong.

01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:06.022
I like it.

01:15:12.278 --> 01:15:14.322
You have quite a library.

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:17.492
Did you bring all these books
from Germany?

01:15:17.701 --> 01:15:19.244
A few of them.

01:15:19.452 --> 01:15:22.372
- May 17?
- Of course.

01:15:22.747 --> 01:15:27.669
Most of these I could not bear
to leave behind.

01:15:27.877 --> 01:15:32.382
I sold everything that I owned
to get my passage to come here...

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.010
...but my books, never.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.890
Shakespeare.

01:15:41.307 --> 01:15:44.352
Some books are so familiar.

01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:48.857
Reading them is like
being home again.

01:15:51.234 --> 01:15:55.196
Will you be returning to Berlin,
Professor Bhaer?

01:15:55.405 --> 01:15:59.075
- Friedrich. Call me Friedrich.
- Friedrich.

01:15:59.284 --> 01:16:02.871
No. Sadly...

01:16:03.079 --> 01:16:05.832
...the fatherland of
Goethe and Schiller...

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.544
-...IS No more.
- I adore Goethe.

01:16:09.753 --> 01:16:11.463
My father used to read me
all the German poets...

01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:15.008
-...when I was a child.
- Really? That is most surprising.

01:16:15.216 --> 01:16:18.720
Well, my mother and father
were part of...

01:16:18.928 --> 01:16:21.806
...a rather unusual circle in Concord.

01:16:22.015 --> 01:16:24.434
Do you know the word
transcendentalist?

01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:28.062
But this is German
Romantic philosophy!

01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:31.065
We throw off all our constraints
and we come to know ourselves...

01:16:31.274 --> 01:16:36.196
...through insight and experience.
But it got out of fashion now.

01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:39.407
Well, not in the March family, I'm afraid.

01:16:41.034 --> 01:16:43.495
It's just that with all
of this transcendence...

01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:48.666
...comes much emphasis
on perfecting oneself.

01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:51.085
This gives you a problem?

01:16:52.337 --> 01:16:54.339
I'm hopelessly flawed.

01:16:54.547 --> 01:16:56.800
If only we could...

01:16:57.008 --> 01:16:59.677
...transcend ourselves
without perfection...

01:16:59.886 --> 01:17:01.054
...like your poet Walt Whitman...

01:17:01.262 --> 01:17:03.348
...who rides up and down
the streets of Broadway all day...

01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:06.434
...Shouting poetry against
the roar of the carts.

01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:08.895
Keep your silent woods,
O, Nature.

01:17:09.103 --> 01:17:11.773
- And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods.

01:17:11.981 --> 01:17:13.024
- By the woods.
- Woods. Yes.

01:17:13.233 --> 01:17:17.153
- Give me the streets of Manhattan.
- Give me the streets of Manhattan.

01:17:28.665 --> 01:17:32.210
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.

01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:36.673
He is as poor as one might imagine...

01:17:36.881 --> 01:17:39.300
...an itinerant philosopher to be.

01:17:39.509 --> 01:17:41.302
Yet, as the weeks go by,
I see that he is...

01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:45.306
...unfailingly generous
to all of us who live in the house.

01:17:45.515 --> 01:17:48.560
I am grateful to have a friend.

01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:42.405
It's the system
our nation was founded on.

01:18:42.614 --> 01:18:46.200
Come now! It was nothing short
of a betrayal of our country's ideals.

01:18:46.409 --> 01:18:48.411
Our country's ideals?

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.954
A constitution...

01:18:50.163 --> 01:18:54.375
...that denies the basic rights of
citizenship to women and black people?

01:18:54.584 --> 01:18:58.588
They just passed the 15th Amendment,
Jacob. They can vote.

01:18:58.796 --> 01:18:59.923
Black men can vote, Charles.

01:19:00.131 --> 01:19:04.344
A lady has no need of suffrage
if she has a husband.

01:19:04.552 --> 01:19:05.678
No, no.

01:19:05.887 --> 01:19:08.222
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.

01:19:08.431 --> 01:19:10.600
- Well, pretend that you've got a cold.
- I agree.

01:19:10.808 --> 01:19:13.770
But if women are a moral force,
shouldn't they have the right...

01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:17.649
...to govern and preach,
and testify in court?

01:19:18.274 --> 01:19:20.610
What is it, Miss March?

01:19:20.818 --> 01:19:24.364
I find it poor logic to say
that because women are good...

01:19:24.572 --> 01:19:26.699
...women should vote.

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:30.411
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.290
And women should vote, not because
they are angels and men are animals...

01:19:34.499 --> 01:19:38.836
...but because we are human beings
and citizens of this country.

01:19:39.837 --> 01:19:42.173
You should've been a lawyer,
Miss March.

01:19:42.382 --> 01:19:45.969
I should have been
a great many things, Mr. Mayer.

01:19:57.855 --> 01:19:59.816
Friedrich. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:20:00.024 --> 01:20:03.611
No, please. Please. Come in.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.488
I have some good news.

01:20:05.697 --> 01:20:05.822
A newspaper has published two
of my stories, and they wish to see more.

01:20:05.822 --> 01:20:09.909
A newspaper has published two
of my stories, and they wish to see more.

01:20:10.118 --> 01:20:12.537
- This is wonderful.
- Right there.

01:20:12.745 --> 01:20:15.164
The Daily Volcano.

01:20:15.623 --> 01:20:20.753
"The Sinner's Corpse"
by Joseph March.

01:20:23.589 --> 01:20:29.554
Lunatics. Vampires.
This... This interests you?

01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:35.893
Well, people like thrilling stories,
Friedrich.

01:20:36.102 --> 01:20:38.354
This is what the newspapers want.

01:20:38.563 --> 01:20:41.649
Yes. Yes, I suppose.

01:20:41.983 --> 01:20:43.943
I suppose that is true.

01:20:44.152 --> 01:20:48.448
Yes. Well, it'll buy a new coat for Beth,
and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.

01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:50.074
Jo, pl--

01:21:12.764 --> 01:21:13.890
I...

01:21:15.099 --> 01:21:18.978
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.

01:21:19.187 --> 01:21:23.191
I am saying only
that you should please yourself.

01:21:23.399 --> 01:21:27.195
My opinion is of no importance.

01:21:28.071 --> 01:21:29.113
Do you forgive me?

01:21:29.655 --> 01:21:33.076
- Well, of course.
- Can I make a gift?

01:21:33.284 --> 01:21:36.120
An experience. Do you like the opera?

01:21:36.954 --> 01:21:38.372
Oh, I do.

01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:43.544
I mean, I think I do. We don't seem
to get a lot of opera in Concord.

01:21:46.756 --> 01:21:48.716
Well, I don't have an opera dress.

01:21:48.925 --> 01:21:50.676
You will be perfect.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:55.473
Where we are sitting
we shall not be so formal.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.167
Leila is a goddess.

01:22:23.376 --> 01:22:26.087
She has made a promise
never to love.

01:22:27.046 --> 01:22:31.342
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.

01:22:33.845 --> 01:22:36.597
Oh, look. Trouble is coming.

01:22:36.806 --> 01:22:38.432
What's going to happen?

01:22:38.641 --> 01:22:40.768
The inevitable.

01:22:47.817 --> 01:22:52.530
Leila... Leila's soul is opening.

01:22:52.947 --> 01:22:55.449
She's drawn to an idea.

01:22:55.658 --> 01:23:00.413
He says, "Love has a fatal power."

01:23:24.353 --> 01:23:26.272
"Your heart...

01:23:26.856 --> 01:23:28.941
...understood mine.

01:23:32.653 --> 01:23:37.241
In the depth of the fragrant night...

01:23:38.242 --> 01:23:41.454
.l listened with ravished soul...

01:23:44.624 --> 01:23:47.168
...to your beloved voice.

01:23:50.713 --> 01:23:54.759
Your heart understood mine."

01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:24.849
Oh, Laurie! You wicked...

01:25:25.057 --> 01:25:27.018
We heard you were in Greece
or somewhere.

01:25:27.226 --> 01:25:30.187
Laurie. Come, come.

01:25:30.396 --> 01:25:32.815
You've been much occupied
with business, I am sure.

01:25:33.024 --> 01:25:35.609
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed...

01:25:35.776 --> 01:25:38.821
<i>...should concentrate
on my music for a while.</i>

01:25:39.488 --> 01:25:41.824
- You know Fred Vaughan.
- Freddy.

01:25:42.033 --> 01:25:44.035
- Good day, Laurence.
- Yes.

01:25:44.243 --> 01:25:46.829
And I see you've taken up
a passion for art, Freddy.

01:25:47.038 --> 01:25:51.250
- Aunt March. You look splendid.
- I cannot say the same for you, my boy.

01:25:51.459 --> 01:25:54.628
Amy, dear, will you be long?
I must retire.

01:25:54.837 --> 01:25:58.424
Yes, Aunt March. Do come see us.

01:26:06.724 --> 01:26:10.186
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.

01:26:18.444 --> 01:26:22.073
- Hop, hop, one, two, three, four.
- Hop, hop, one, two, three, four.

01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:24.450
- Hop, hop, hop, turn.
- Hop, hop, hop, turn.

01:26:27.036 --> 01:26:30.873
Friedrich, how long would it take
strychnine to dissolve in brandy?

01:26:31.082 --> 01:26:32.458
About eight minutes?

01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:36.629
And is a dagger worn at the waist,
or is that a saber?

01:26:36.837 --> 01:26:42.510
I think that in these novels the dagger
is usually concealed in the boot...

01:26:42.718 --> 01:26:45.554
...by a man with a dark mustache.

01:27:13.124 --> 01:27:15.000
Go this way.

01:27:16.544 --> 01:27:18.587
Hurry, hurry.

01:27:21.048 --> 01:27:22.758
Well...

01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:35.312
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.

01:27:40.067 --> 01:27:42.153
It isn't what it should be...

01:27:42.361 --> 01:27:45.781
-...but you have improved it.
- Please don't.

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:50.453
I liked you much better
when you were blunt and natural.

01:27:51.912 --> 01:27:54.373
It did not serve me well.

01:27:57.126 --> 01:27:59.545
I find you changed.

01:28:01.964 --> 01:28:03.632
In fact, I despise you.

01:28:03.841 --> 01:28:07.136
You laze about, spending
your family's money and courting women.

01:28:08.012 --> 01:28:10.347
You aren't serious about music.

01:28:10.556 --> 01:28:13.476
My compositions
are like your paintings.

01:28:13.684 --> 01:28:17.771
Mediocre copies
of another man's genius.

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:22.443
Then why don't you go to grandfather
in London and make yourself useful?

01:28:22.651 --> 01:28:24.195
I should.

01:28:24.945 --> 01:28:27.364
Why don't you reform me?

01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:32.578
I've someone more practical in mind.

01:28:32.786 --> 01:28:35.706
You do not love Fred Vaughan.

01:28:35.915 --> 01:28:38.250
Fred Vaughan is stable
and well-mannered--

01:28:38.459 --> 01:28:41.003
And has 40,000 a year.

01:28:41.212 --> 01:28:44.298
I've always known
I would not marry a pauper.

01:28:45.466 --> 01:28:48.344
I expect a proposal any day.

01:28:48.928 --> 01:28:51.180
You'll regret it.

01:28:51.388 --> 01:28:54.308
I'll regret it.

01:28:55.226 --> 01:28:58.646
I'm reminded of a promise.

01:28:59.188 --> 01:29:02.316
Didn't I say I would kiss you
before you die?

01:29:04.318 --> 01:29:06.529
Do you hear from Jo?

01:29:07.196 --> 01:29:10.533
She has befriended a German professor.

01:29:13.369 --> 01:29:15.454
Yes, well, no doubt
he's showing her...

01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:17.540
...the ways of the world.

01:29:18.415 --> 01:29:23.045
I do not wish to be courted by someone
who is still in love with my sister.

01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:25.881
I'm not in love with Jo.

01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:30.719
- Then how do you explain your jealousy?
- I envy her happiness.

01:29:33.097 --> 01:29:35.724
I envy his happiness.

01:29:35.933 --> 01:29:41.063
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.

01:29:41.272 --> 01:29:44.316
And if Beth had a lover,
I would despise him too.

01:29:44.525 --> 01:29:48.862
Just as you have always known
you would never marry a pauper...

01:29:49.071 --> 01:29:54.910
...I have always known
I should be part of the March family.

01:29:55.953 --> 01:29:58.789
I do not wish to be loved for my family.

01:29:58.998 --> 01:30:03.002
Any more than Fred Vaughan
wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.

01:30:30.362 --> 01:30:32.114
My darling Amy.

01:30:32.323 --> 01:30:35.868
It is you I want and not your family.

01:30:36.076 --> 01:30:39.705
I've gone to London
to make myself worthy of you.

01:30:39.913 --> 01:30:44.293
Please, do not do anything
we shall regret.

01:30:47.338 --> 01:30:50.799
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle,
may I show him in?

01:31:02.853 --> 01:31:05.773
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.

01:31:06.523 --> 01:31:07.691
It's...

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.527
Oh, it's well-written, Jo.

01:31:10.736 --> 01:31:14.198
And a first novel.
What a great accomplishment.

01:31:14.406 --> 01:31:17.451
Well, I'm going to be showing it
to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:20.663
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."

01:31:21.705 --> 01:31:22.790
What is it?

01:31:22.998 --> 01:31:25.668
Mr. Fields is a good man. He will--

01:31:25.876 --> 01:31:28.629
He will give you an honest opinion.

01:31:28.837 --> 01:31:31.924
Oh, I see.

01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:35.552
What is your honest opinion?

01:31:35.761 --> 01:31:37.262
I'm a professor of philosophy, Jo.

01:31:37.471 --> 01:31:39.682
No, I'd really like to know
what you think.

01:31:42.184 --> 01:31:46.855
You sh--
You should be writing from life...

01:31:47.064 --> 01:31:49.024
...from the depths of your soul.

01:31:49.233 --> 01:31:52.736
There is nothing in here of the woman
that I am privileged to know.

01:31:55.155 --> 01:31:57.950
Friedrich, this is what I write.

01:31:59.535 --> 01:32:02.538
My apologies if it fails
to live up to your high standards.

01:32:02.746 --> 01:32:06.291
Jo, there is more to you than this...

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.586
...if you have the courage to write it.

01:32:54.757 --> 01:32:55.966
Meg!

01:32:58.385 --> 01:32:59.386
Jo?

01:33:02.723 --> 01:33:04.433
Jo!

01:33:04.933 --> 01:33:06.268
Oh, Meg!

01:33:09.563 --> 01:33:11.815
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

01:33:12.024 --> 01:33:14.109
Well, one hardly speaks
of such things.

01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:17.154
Oh, how wonderful.

01:33:21.074 --> 01:33:25.788
- How is Beth?
- You will find her much altered.

01:33:43.347 --> 01:33:45.015
Marmee.

01:33:48.519 --> 01:33:50.979
She wouldn't let us
send for you sooner.

01:33:51.188 --> 01:33:54.817
The doctor has been here
a number of times...

01:33:55.025 --> 01:33:57.861
...but it's beyond all of us, and I think...

01:34:02.574 --> 01:34:05.494
I think she's been waiting for you...

01:34:06.328 --> 01:34:08.080
...before--

01:34:22.219 --> 01:34:25.722
Drink up all this good broth.

01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:30.727
- I'm glad you're home.
- So am I.

01:34:47.327 --> 01:34:51.039
"Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.

01:34:51.248 --> 01:34:55.794
'Well, that's important. There's nothing
suspicious then, I suppose.™

01:34:57.129 --> 01:35:00.340
I feel stronger with you close by.

01:35:03.802 --> 01:35:06.430
I'm gonna get you better yet.

01:35:07.347 --> 01:35:11.560
If God wants me with him,
there is none who will stop him.

01:35:17.482 --> 01:35:19.651
I don't mind.

01:35:20.736 --> 01:35:23.280
I was never like the rest of you...

01:35:23.488 --> 01:35:27.868
...making plans
about the great things I'd do.

01:35:30.162 --> 01:35:33.624
I never saw myself as anything much.

01:35:33.832 --> 01:35:36.335
Not a great writer like you.

01:35:36.543 --> 01:35:39.379
Oh, Beth. I'm not a great writer.

01:35:39.588 --> 01:35:41.798
But you will be.

01:35:45.552 --> 01:35:48.931
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.

01:35:52.684 --> 01:35:55.979
Why does everyone want to go away?

01:35:57.481 --> 01:36:00.400
I love being home.

01:36:03.362 --> 01:36:06.615
But I don't like being left behind.

01:36:10.619 --> 01:36:13.664
Now I am the one going ahead.

01:36:17.626 --> 01:36:20.545
I am not afraid.

01:36:22.297 --> 01:36:25.384
I can be brave like you.

01:36:27.928 --> 01:36:33.308
But I know I shall be
homesick for you, even in heaven.

01:36:33.517 --> 01:36:35.936
Oh, Beth.

01:36:36.144 --> 01:36:37.604
No.

01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:41.149
I won't let you go.

01:36:42.484 --> 01:36:44.695
Oh, my Jo.

01:39:04.918 --> 01:39:07.003
Aunt March is bedridden...

01:39:07.212 --> 01:39:09.506
...and would not survive a sea voyage.

01:39:09.714 --> 01:39:12.759
Amy must bide her time
and return later.

01:39:14.678 --> 01:39:16.763
It's just as well.

01:39:19.891 --> 01:39:23.228
Will we never all be together again?

01:40:11.318 --> 01:40:14.487
- Lovely morning.
- Good morning.

01:40:14.696 --> 01:40:16.489
Thank you, sir.

01:40:28.919 --> 01:40:30.670
Dearest Laurie.

01:40:30.879 --> 01:40:33.632
You may not have heard
our sad news of Beth.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.884
"Meg has entered her confinement...

01:40:36.092 --> 01:40:39.721
...and poor Amy must stay
in Vevey with Aunt March."

01:40:48.563 --> 01:40:52.442
This is far too great a sorrow
to bear alone.

01:40:52.651 --> 01:40:55.695
Please come home to us,
Teddy dear.

01:40:56.238 --> 01:40:59.199
Your faithful, Jo.

01:41:17.634 --> 01:41:20.136
Oh, Laurie.

01:41:27.727 --> 01:41:30.063
I knew you would come.

01:43:38.691 --> 01:43:41.027
The real charm of it lay
in Beth's happy face...

01:43:41.236 --> 01:43:42.695
...as she leaned over the new piano...

01:43:42.904 --> 01:43:47.242
...and lovingly touched
the beautiful black and white keys.

01:43:51.037 --> 01:43:53.456
During the next few minutes,
the rumor circulated...

01:43:53.665 --> 01:43:58.128
...that Amy March had got
24 delicious limes.

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.964
! told you they dressed me up,
but I didn't tell you...

01:44:01.172 --> 01:44:05.093
...that they powdered and squeezed,
and made me look a fashion plate.

01:44:06.803 --> 01:44:09.472
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.

01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:14.727
A general outcry arose,
for all her abundant hair was cut short.

01:44:14.936 --> 01:44:18.273
Jo, how could you? Your one beauty.

01:44:18.481 --> 01:44:21.276
Nothing's going to change, Jo.

01:45:59.332 --> 01:46:01.084
Surprise!

01:46:02.335 --> 01:46:04.837
John, you have a daughter.

01:46:05.046 --> 01:46:07.006
And a son.

01:46:10.051 --> 01:46:13.805
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe
you did this four times.

01:46:15.139 --> 01:46:16.766
Yes...

01:46:17.016 --> 01:46:20.562
...but never two at once, my darling.

01:46:39.706 --> 01:46:41.457
Oh, Daisy.

01:46:44.085 --> 01:46:46.296
Oh, Meg. She's so beautiful.

01:46:46.504 --> 01:46:48.881
And him. He is handsome.

01:46:49.090 --> 01:46:51.926
He's gonna look
just like his papa when he grows up.

01:46:52.135 --> 01:46:55.138
Yes, he does look like John.

01:46:57.223 --> 01:46:59.684
Have you heard from the professor?

01:47:00.018 --> 01:47:03.062
No. No.

01:47:04.647 --> 01:47:07.191
We did not part well.

01:47:09.569 --> 01:47:12.989
Well, John and I don't always agree,
but then we mend it.

01:47:14.866 --> 01:47:16.701
Who could that be?

01:47:29.213 --> 01:47:31.215
- Jo!
- Teddy!

01:47:31.424 --> 01:47:34.677
- Oh, this is magic!
- You are absolutely--

01:47:34.886 --> 01:47:38.890
Covered in flour. Oh, dear! Come in.

01:47:39.098 --> 01:47:42.685
No, Jo, not yet. May I tell you something
without the others?

01:47:42.894 --> 01:47:44.479
You're my dear friend.

01:47:44.687 --> 01:47:47.231
- I'm glad you shall be the first to know.
- What?

01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.485
May I present...

01:47:50.693 --> 01:47:52.320
...my wife.

01:47:54.697 --> 01:47:56.532
Jo.

01:47:58.451 --> 01:48:00.995
Amy. Oh, my.

01:48:02.121 --> 01:48:05.708
- Here. Flowers. Oh, you're so--
- Thank you.

01:48:05.917 --> 01:48:08.461
Come in. Come in.

01:48:16.636 --> 01:48:19.389
Brussels lace.

01:48:19.597 --> 01:48:22.141
I went to Europe to paint
the great cathedrals...

01:48:22.308 --> 01:48:24.977
...but I couldn't get our home
out of my mind.

01:48:25.186 --> 01:48:27.480
Oh, look how Amy
has captured Orchard House.

01:48:27.689 --> 01:48:29.107
- Look.
- Lovely.

01:48:29.273 --> 01:48:31.567
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:48:31.776 --> 01:48:35.113
Not as beautiful as I wanted,
but I am still learning.

01:48:38.408 --> 01:48:40.827
Dear little angel.

01:48:42.412 --> 01:48:46.207
Jo, you must tell me
the truth as a sister...

01:48:46.416 --> 01:48:49.502
...which is a relation
stronger than marriage.

01:48:50.002 --> 01:48:51.879
Do you mind at all?

01:48:53.381 --> 01:48:54.549
Oh, no.

01:48:54.757 --> 01:48:57.427
I was surprised.

01:48:57.635 --> 01:49:00.263
Mind you, I had it on
good authority that our Teddy...

01:49:00.471 --> 01:49:04.142
...would never love another,
and now he's gone and gotten married.

01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:06.269
It's good to hear you
call me Teddy again.

01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:14.902
At last, we're all family
as we always should have been.

01:49:15.695 --> 01:49:19.031
You must promise me that
you will always live close by.

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.451
I couldn't bear losing another sister.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.344
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.

01:49:40.553 --> 01:49:44.766
One would require an income
just for the coal to heat this place.

01:49:44.974 --> 01:49:47.268
What could the dear girl
have been thinking?

01:49:47.477 --> 01:49:49.979
Most likely she felt sorry for me.

01:49:50.188 --> 01:49:52.648
Decrepit homeless spinster.

01:49:52.857 --> 01:49:54.567
Jo.

01:49:54.901 --> 01:49:57.695
Poor aunt,
living here all those years alone...

01:49:57.904 --> 01:50:01.657
...in this useless old house.

01:50:01.866 --> 01:50:05.536
Yes, her blessings became a burden
because she couldn't share them.

01:50:05.745 --> 01:50:07.622
Wouldn't this have made
a wonderful school?

01:50:07.622 --> 01:50:08.706
Wouldn't this have made
a wonderful school?

01:50:09.081 --> 01:50:11.083
A school.

01:50:13.377 --> 01:50:15.880
What a challenge that would be.

01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:38.361
Hello, Tuppy. Hello.

01:50:41.864 --> 01:50:43.616
Good boy.

01:50:54.168 --> 01:50:58.381
My book.
Someone's publishing my book.

01:50:58.589 --> 01:51:00.842
Hannah! Hannah!

01:51:01.050 --> 01:51:03.803
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us.

01:51:04.011 --> 01:51:05.680
But it came with no letter.
How did it arrive?

01:51:05.888 --> 01:51:07.014
Foreign gentleman brung it.

01:51:07.223 --> 01:51:10.226
- Strange kind of name. Can't think of it.
- Hannah!

01:51:10.434 --> 01:51:14.146
- Oh, fox or bear or such.
- Bhaer! Did you ask him to wait?

01:51:14.355 --> 01:51:17.149
I thought he was
one of Miss Amy's European friends...

01:51:17.358 --> 01:51:18.860
...coming with a wedding gift.

01:51:19.068 --> 01:51:23.114
I said, "Miss March
and Mr. Laurie are living next door."

01:51:23.322 --> 01:51:27.285
- Oh, Hannah, you didn't!
- And he said he had a train to catch.

01:51:42.592 --> 01:51:44.385
Friedrich!

01:51:58.316 --> 01:52:00.526
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.

01:52:03.738 --> 01:52:07.575
Well, when I didn't hear from you,
I thought you hated it.

01:52:07.783 --> 01:52:12.079
Oh, no. No.
Reading your book was like...

01:52:12.288 --> 01:52:14.373
...opening a window into your heart.

01:52:14.582 --> 01:52:19.462
James Fields took it out of my hands,
and he would not give it back to me.

01:52:19.670 --> 01:52:23.299
I said,
"Such news I have to give to her myself."

01:52:23.925 --> 01:52:27.553
Well, it was... It was a silly impulse.

01:52:27.762 --> 01:52:31.057
No, no. Not silly at all.

01:52:32.224 --> 01:52:36.062
It's so good to see you.
Come and meet my family.

01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:37.897
No, I--

01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:40.066
Thank you...

01:52:40.358 --> 01:52:43.110
...but I have to catch the train.

01:52:43.319 --> 01:52:46.113
- I'm going to the west.

01:52:46.322 --> 01:52:49.951
My ship leaves from Boston
tomorrow morning.

01:52:51.118 --> 01:52:54.956
Yes. The schools in the west are young.

01:52:55.164 --> 01:52:57.375
They need professors...

01:52:58.459 --> 01:53:02.296
...and they're not so concerned
about the accent.

01:53:04.799 --> 01:53:07.051
I don't mind it either.

01:53:09.053 --> 01:53:12.306
You see, my aunt left me Plumfield.

01:53:12.515 --> 01:53:16.435
It isn't a field. It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.

01:53:16.644 --> 01:53:20.314
And it isn't really good for anything
except a school.

01:53:20.523 --> 01:53:22.066
And I want a good school...

01:53:22.274 --> 01:53:24.860
...one that would be open
to anyone who wanted to learn.

01:53:25.027 --> 01:53:28.447
And, well, I'll be needing someone...

01:53:28.656 --> 01:53:31.951
...who knows how to teach.

01:53:32.493 --> 01:53:35.329
Is there nothing I might say
to keep you here?

01:53:35.496 --> 01:53:37.957
I confess that...

01:53:38.165 --> 01:53:41.711
<i>.- was hoping that I might
have a reason 10 stay...</i>

01:53:41.919 --> 01:53:47.133
...but congratulations
on the celebration of your marriage.

01:53:47.341 --> 01:53:51.971
Oh, no. No. No, that's Amy.

01:53:52.179 --> 01:53:54.807
She's my sister, Amy,
and Laurie, actually.

01:53:55.016 --> 01:53:58.394
No, I'm-- I'm not married.

01:54:00.896 --> 01:54:03.357
Please don't go so far away.

01:54:05.276 --> 01:54:07.319
Jo.

01:54:07.528 --> 01:54:12.074
Such a little name for such a person.

01:54:15.953 --> 01:54:17.371
Will you have me?

01:54:18.914 --> 01:54:21.459
With all of my heart.

01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:28.841
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.

01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:33.804
Not empty now.
