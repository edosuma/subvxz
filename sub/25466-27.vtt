Oh, no!

10:14.831 --> 10:17.834
Get off my planet, Mr. Mind.

[SCREAMS]
Thwarted once again!

10:22.752 --> 10:24.406
Let this be a lesson, Titans.

10:24.449 --> 10:28.236
The fact that you didn't take
me or Mr. Mind seriously

10:28.279 --> 10:32.283
is the reason superheroes
have become so grim
and serious today.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.415
I see that now.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.809
Thank you, flying child man.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.462
Well done, Billy Batson.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.116
You truly are

10:40.335 --> 10:41.945
the prophecy.
