WEBVTT

00:16.350 --> 00:17.183
My name is Joseph Weedle.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.226
I'm an FBI agent.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.894
You can't do this to me!

00:23.024 --> 00:24.899
Rapunzel, get the hell off of him!

00:24.900 --> 00:25.860
Dammit!

00:30.281 --> 00:32.907
All right.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.076
Oh, stop whining,

00:35.077 --> 00:35.785
you were done
with that body anyways.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.954
Put him in the machine!

00:37.955 --> 00:40.373
What are you doing?
You can't do this to me!

00:40.374 --> 00:41.416
Here, come on, let's go,
we're behind the clock here.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.627
Go. Go!

00:44.628 --> 00:46.547
God... Idiots.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.513
In perpetuum.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.431
In perpetuum.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.312
Ah...

01:05.524 --> 01:06.734
Yeah, clear here.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.614
Brother.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.491
Brothers.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.285
See, I told you
it would all work out.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.372
What about the obsolete soul?

01:21.373 --> 01:23.833
Oh, yeah.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.252
Hmm. Oh, well.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.839
Oh, good girl.
Goodbye, Agent Weedle.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.092
Get it! Get!

01:55.825 --> 01:56.825
<i>Can I eat this?</i>

01:56.826 --> 01:58.118
What is it?

01:58.119 --> 02:00.078
Dirk made that.
Don't eat it.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.246
Can I ask you a question?
I'm gonna ask.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.705
<i>What?</i>

02:02.706 --> 02:05.125
Your apartment.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.211
It did not
used to look like this.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.632
Yeah, there was a whole...

02:12.633 --> 02:14.050
thing.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.844
I swear to God,

02:15.845 --> 02:17.263
you are the shadiest person
in the world.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.475
<i>Todd! Todd, come out!</i>

02:22.476 --> 02:24.436
Farah says
she's solved the mystery!

02:26.021 --> 02:27.188
Todd, come out!

02:27.189 --> 02:29.150
Farah says she didn't
solve the mystery!

02:31.485 --> 02:32.861
Oh, God...

02:32.862 --> 02:34.737
Are they waiting for you?

02:34.738 --> 02:36.614
I think he thinks
he's waiting for me.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.116
What about Farah?

02:38.117 --> 02:40.285
Dude! Seriously?

02:40.286 --> 02:41.911
A magic detective
and a hot chick

02:41.912 --> 02:43.580
want you
to come hang with them,

02:43.581 --> 02:45.540
and you're acting like
it's the worst thing ever.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.292
I don't want
to drag you into it.

02:47.293 --> 02:47.626
Drag me!

02:47.627 --> 02:48.877
I wanna get dragged.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.129
I'm trying to keep you safe.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.131
Okay, Todd, we're leaving!

02:53.132 --> 02:54.508
They're leaving.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.676
You'll be okay?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.343
You're gonna go?

02:57.344 --> 02:58.386
- It--
- I'll be fine.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.180
- I worry.
- I know you do.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.807
But... I have your number,

03:02.808 --> 03:04.267
I have Dirk's number,

03:04.268 --> 03:05.602
I even have Farah's number.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.729
I'll be fine.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.606
Ooh! Take your cool guy jacket.

03:09.607 --> 03:10.773
You look good in it.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.567
Why?

03:12.902 --> 03:14.569
Farah.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.112
I see the looks.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.280
- The looks?
- You-her.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.115
Not her-you.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.367
Dirk's got a jacket,
she's got a jacket.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.036
Jacket Team, go.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.287
I'll stay here,
I'll clean this place up.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.164
- Really?
- No, hell no.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.583
Hey...

03:28.584 --> 03:29.876
I love you.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.503
Yeah, I know.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.969
Hey! It-it's me!
Wait up.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.639
Hey.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.182
C-couldn't find
my jacket.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.808
That's what...
took so long.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.644
I was telling Dirk,

03:47.645 --> 03:49.979
1978, height
of the oil crisis, right?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.482
Edgar Spring,
Patrick's father,

03:52.483 --> 03:54.108
buried his own power grid,
three-mile radius,

03:54.109 --> 03:55.401
calls it
"Springsborough--"

03:55.402 --> 03:56.736
There's a grid.
It's under our feet.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.155
We're walking on it
right now.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.574
They say he had
an unlimited energy device.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.533
Who?

04:02.534 --> 04:03.785
Edgar Spring!
Aren't you listening?

04:03.786 --> 04:05.078
He powered
this part of the city

04:05.079 --> 04:06.537
for 30 years, on his own.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.791
Power went dark around the time
he bought back the Webb Mansion

04:09.792 --> 04:11.209
<i>from the government.</i>

04:11.210 --> 04:12.335
What happened
to Edgar Spring?

04:12.336 --> 04:13.503
No one knows.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.171
Some people say he died.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.547
Some people say
he's still out there somewhere.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.632
Why didn't you
just ask Patrick?

04:17.633 --> 04:19.133
He never talked about it.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.802
After his wife, Catherine,
was murdered,

04:20.803 --> 04:23.096
he totally removed himself

04:23.097 --> 04:24.681
from anything having to do
with Springsborough.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.182
I didn't even know
about this place.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.351
So... the unlimited energy device,

04:28.352 --> 04:30.019
that's the machine
those guys are after?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.021
The bad guys, right?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.189
The bad--

04:33.190 --> 04:35.066
Yes, but no one
ever found it.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.234
Until now.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.278
- Did you find it?
- No. But--

04:38.279 --> 04:39.654
The schematic we found,

04:39.655 --> 04:42.156
it's a layout
of Spring's power grid,

04:42.157 --> 04:43.533
including the Ridgely,

04:43.534 --> 04:45.201
with only one access point.

04:45.202 --> 04:45.910
And would you believe,

04:45.911 --> 04:49.122
could you ever for a second
imagine where that would be?

04:49.123 --> 04:50.666
Because it's right here.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.877
<i>Jesus Christ, this thing?</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:56.546
I drive by it every day
on my way to work.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.007
Are we gonna climb this fence?
I want to climb the fence.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.050
Who's climbing the fence?
Me first!

05:03.429 --> 05:05.263
How long have you been
his assistant?

05:05.264 --> 05:06.472
Three days.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.974
Three days?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.393
Four, really.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.562
I assumed you'd been
together for years.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.980
Why would you think that?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.233
Todd! Push my bum!
Make me go up!

05:17.234 --> 05:20.112
Right.
No, we just met, and I hate him.

05:22.197 --> 05:22.990
Hello.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.329
Hello, police detectives.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.956
Agent Weedle, we didn't
expect to see you so soon.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.207
<i>This situation is a mess.</i>

05:33.208 --> 05:34.835
You got anything on Farah Black?

05:36.086 --> 05:37.170
Lydia Spring's bodyguard?

05:37.171 --> 05:39.088
No, we haven't found her yet.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.591
Anything I can read on her?
I have some questions.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.467
Only some?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.392
Sure.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.187
And the bodies from the penthouse
still haven't turned up.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.646
We're starting to think
they were stolen.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.814
We pulled them.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.941
I'm sorry, what?

06:00.736 --> 06:02.737
The FBI pulled them.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.572
<i>Part of a larger issue,
none of your concern.</i>

06:04.573 --> 06:06.491
We asked you, to your face,

06:06.492 --> 06:08.409
"Did you transfer out
the bodies?"

06:08.410 --> 06:10.328
Oh, yeah, well,
at the time...

06:10.329 --> 06:11.913
we didn't think
you needed to know.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.873
Did you connect
to Dirk Gently?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.583
I've been trying to get
some more info on the guy.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.419
No Dirk Gently,
but Todd Brotzman walked himself in.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.962
Brotzman?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.923
Gently's assistant?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.257
The bellhop?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.593
Did he mention a corgi?

06:25.677 --> 06:26.928
What do you know
about the corgi?

06:26.929 --> 06:27.637
What corgi?

06:27.638 --> 06:28.763
The one you just
asked about--

06:28.764 --> 06:30.598
Forget that.
Did you arrest Brotzman?

06:30.599 --> 06:31.808
Brotzman...

06:31.809 --> 06:33.185
For what?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.438
Are you kidding me?

06:37.439 --> 06:40.191
What is this, amateur hour?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.110
Are you guys
just pretending to be cops?

06:42.111 --> 06:44.695
Brotzman, Farah Black,
Dirk Gently,

06:44.696 --> 06:46.406
what, these are just wild
cards to you right now?

06:46.407 --> 06:48.908
Does Missing Persons
even get badges,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.576
or, what, just, like,
some type of laminated--

06:50.577 --> 06:52.162
Okay, you gonna
have to hold...

06:54.581 --> 06:55.749
Nathan.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.460
Where's Nathan?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.421
Nathan...

07:01.797 --> 07:03.882
Your partner.
Nathan?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.387
Where can I find Brotzman?

07:09.388 --> 07:10.263
<i>The Ridgely.</i>

07:10.264 --> 07:12.098
You were investigating
his landlord, Dorian.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.225
Shouldn't you--

07:16.645 --> 07:18.896
I'll speak
with Brotzman myself,

07:18.897 --> 07:20.399
straighten some things out.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.569
I like your office.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.280
Am I having a stroke?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.739
Could that guy not hear me?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.658
And two days ago,
that dude was quiet.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.243
When did he become
Billy Bad-Ass?

07:32.244 --> 07:33.995
We said too much.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.037
There is something wrong.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.539
There is something...

07:36.540 --> 07:38.374
seriously wrong.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.043
'Cause you know
what he really wanted.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.051
Something's weird
about that dog.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.144
Oh.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.191
What do you think
Patrick wants us to find?

08:03.192 --> 08:04.275
I mean,
how do we even know

08:04.276 --> 08:05.735
he's the good guy here?

08:05.736 --> 08:07.236
I have to find Lydia.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.738
I messed this up.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.156
What?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.991
I wasn't there when he died.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.202
But that's not fair.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.370
You were trying to find
his kidnapped daughter.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.206
You were handcuffed
to a bed.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.249
Yeah. That was my fault.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.126
<i>It was your job,</i>

08:22.127 --> 08:23.419
and you...

08:23.420 --> 08:24.754
Look, I-I mean,

08:24.755 --> 08:27.173
these guys are dangerous,

08:27.174 --> 08:29.425
and if it's just, like,
some kind of...

08:29.426 --> 08:30.636
M-Maybe we shouldn't...

08:37.142 --> 08:39.852
I mean,
I-I left Amanda alone, so...

08:39.853 --> 08:41.771
maybe we shouldn't...

08:41.772 --> 08:45.191
There's a little girl
out there who needs me.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.568
You saw Lydia Spring,

08:47.569 --> 08:49.779
and as far as I can tell,
the only people looking for her

08:49.780 --> 08:51.072
are him,

08:51.073 --> 08:53.824
me, and you.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.910
Patrick knew
he was going to die,

08:55.911 --> 08:58.371
and this is the only lead
he left us,

08:58.372 --> 09:00.957
so we're going
to figure it out, okay?

09:00.958 --> 09:02.458
Okay?

09:02.459 --> 09:03.876
Say "Okay."

09:03.877 --> 09:05.211
Say "O-

09:05.212 --> 09:06.128
kay."

09:06.129 --> 09:06.921
Okay.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.548
Okay--

09:08.549 --> 09:09.925
<i>Help!</i>

09:11.093 --> 09:13.386
<i>I've fallen in a... thing!</i>

09:13.387 --> 09:14.929
<i>There are traps here,
apparently!</i>

09:14.930 --> 09:17.765
<i>It's a whole
spooky trap ancient area.</i>

09:17.766 --> 09:19.392
<i>Very much dangerous!</i>

09:19.393 --> 09:21.894
<i>I turned the crank
we found in the lab,</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.729
<i>which was a mistake
to do unsupervised, perhaps,</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.523
<i>now that I think about it.</i>

09:25.524 --> 09:26.691
This crank?

09:26.692 --> 09:28.193
I don't understand what you--

09:43.542 --> 09:44.750
Todd Brotzman?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.627
Nope.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.797
Is he home?
F.B.I.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.549
Wait, like...

09:51.550 --> 09:53.801
for real F.B.I.?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.886
<i>Yes, Ma'am.
Can you let me in?</i>

09:55.887 --> 09:58.639
Okay, well, uh,
Todd's not here.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.725
<i>I can wait.</i>

10:01.018 --> 10:03.227
Like, just stand there?
'Cause...

10:03.228 --> 10:05.605
he might be a really long time.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.690
Not a problem.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.491
What the...

10:17.492 --> 10:19.327
Where are we?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.621
Underground.
And there's a corridor.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.997
And it's dark.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.207
This is it.
This is the clue, right?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.500
You're asking me?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.336
<i>Are you injured?</i>

10:28.337 --> 10:30.171
Where are you?

10:30.172 --> 10:32.381
<i>Farah, don't step where I did!</i>

10:32.382 --> 10:34.301
Yeah, that seemed like
a poor choice.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.637
Hey! Don't wander off.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.388
I'm investigating!

10:39.389 --> 10:40.389
Ooh.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.059
<i>What can you see?</i>

10:42.267 --> 10:43.976
Uh, it's dark.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.102
There's seems to be

10:45.103 --> 10:46.937
some kind of passage.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.564
<i>Okay, let me see</i>

10:48.565 --> 10:51.192
<i>if I can find something
to get you out of there.</i>

10:55.697 --> 10:56.447
Hello?

10:56.448 --> 10:58.115
Hey, it's Amanda.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.950
Sorry, I tried to call
Todd and Dirk,

10:59.951 --> 11:02.244
but, uh, it went
straight to voicemail.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.037
<i>Is everything cool?</i>

11:03.038 --> 11:04.538
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

11:04.539 --> 11:06.248
It's your sister!

11:06.249 --> 11:07.208
Is she okay?

11:07.209 --> 11:08.084
Are you okay?

11:08.085 --> 11:09.919
Yeah, I'm fine, but, uh...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.754
there is a guy here.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.755
<i>F.B.I., he says.</i>

11:12.756 --> 11:14.131
F.B.I.?
What does he want?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.466
<i>He's asking for Todd.</i>

11:15.467 --> 11:17.385
He says he'll wait outside
until he comes back.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.095
Where is Todd?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.137
What's Amanda saying?

11:20.138 --> 11:21.764
She wants to know
where you are!

11:21.765 --> 11:23.724
Don't tell her
I'm in a secret passage!

11:23.725 --> 11:25.101
He's in a secret passage.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.602
What?! Oh!

11:26.603 --> 11:28.312
- She's excited!
- Of course.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.480
Seriously?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.233
Wait, what do you mean
he'll wait outside?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.026
He's not just
standing outside, is he?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.403
That's exactly what he's doing.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.697
That's not right at all.
That's against protocol.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.906
Is Amanda okay?

11:38.907 --> 11:41.325
I'm coming back.
Don't let him in.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.327
Got it.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.420
I'll be right back
to get you out of there.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.921
<i>Stay there.</i>

11:53.922 --> 11:56.257
Wait!
Get me out of here!

11:56.258 --> 11:57.216
Hello?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.926
<i>Farah!</i>

11:58.927 --> 12:01.595
We should definitely
go down this passageway.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.222
Dirk, wait!

12:03.223 --> 12:04.515
Dirk, we should just
stay here!

12:04.516 --> 12:05.225
Dirk!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.994
<i>Hi.</i>

12:24.995 --> 12:26.954
Hey.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.581
Gordon.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.583
Hey.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.003
Are you okay?

12:34.004 --> 12:35.629
Yeah.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.965
I'm fine.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.633
What's this?

12:39.634 --> 12:40.634
A present.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.136
Aw, Gordon.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.554
I told you.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.181
Honey, you gotta--

12:45.182 --> 12:46.307
you gotta stop
getting me things.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.852
It's just not gonna change
the way I feel.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.772
It's the last one.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.940
Promise.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.786
<i>This Lux stuff...</i>

13:07.162 --> 13:09.539
You really cared
about him, huh?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.374
When he disappeared,

13:12.375 --> 13:15.127
I think everyone
just sort of...

13:15.128 --> 13:18.130
you know, was waiting.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.843
Just waiting for him
to come back.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.187
This F.B.I. guy,
your new boyfriend, where's he--

13:33.188 --> 13:34.189
Gone.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.775
Probably back to his wife.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.110
What was his name again?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.111
Nathan.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.406
What?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.325
Uh...

13:46.326 --> 13:49.787
Life is wild.

13:49.788 --> 13:50.956
I'll drink to that.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.009
<i>F.B.I.
Ready to let me in?</i>

14:04.010 --> 14:06.887
No.
Todd is coming soon, so--

14:08.640 --> 14:10.350
<i>This door is broken.</i>

14:14.604 --> 14:16.273
Hoped you wouldn't notice.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.568
I don't want you in here,

14:20.569 --> 14:21.443
and you can't just come in
without--

14:21.444 --> 14:23.028
- I think I'll wait inside.
- No.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.114
Are you serious? No.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.866
<i>Get out of here right now.</i>

14:26.867 --> 14:28.909
You shouldn't be alone.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.328
If anything happened to you,

14:31.329 --> 14:32.247
who would come looking?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.750
Dirk, this is crazy.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.085
Lots of debris.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.337
Careful.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.592
Probably earthquake damage.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.763
Who cares?
There's a door.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.974
You think it leads
to a way out?

14:51.975 --> 14:55.269
Possibly.
Maybe even probably.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.229
Definitely?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.607
Where did you get that?

14:59.608 --> 15:01.150
Spring's lab,

15:01.151 --> 15:02.902
same place I got the crank
that got us in.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.111
You just... stole stuff?

15:04.112 --> 15:06.113
No, found.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.532
It's like stealing,
but no one yells at you.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.785
I call it... an "Everbulb."

15:11.786 --> 15:16.290
I think it's using electricity
from our bodies to power itself.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.459
Edgar was absolutely obsessed
with electricity.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.627
Fantastic, right?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.337
Do you not see?

15:21.338 --> 15:24.298
Can you not comprehend
how freaking weird this is?

15:24.299 --> 15:27.217
We are now underground
with a magic light bulb.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.928
This place has
been here for decades,

15:28.929 --> 15:31.597
and even if Patrick Spring
hid something in his father's maze,

15:31.598 --> 15:33.933
what the hell
does this guy want?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.659
What now?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.877
What is this place?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.463
Something from Patrick Spring.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.424
A message...

16:13.598 --> 16:15.600
I think the message is,
"You're going to die."

16:27.988 --> 16:29.613
We're going to be crushed, Todd!

16:29.614 --> 16:31.740
Distressingly slow!

16:31.741 --> 16:33.784
Ah! And burnt!

16:33.785 --> 16:36.704
Burnt and crushed to death
like Watkin in Star War!

16:36.705 --> 16:38.664
It's too bright in here!

16:38.665 --> 16:39.873
- Give me your jacket!
- What's wrong with yours?

16:39.874 --> 16:40.792
Give it to me, now!

16:50.468 --> 16:52.094
Oh, well done.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.638
Now our death is even more
stabbier than before!

16:54.639 --> 16:56.598
Why would Patrick Spring
send us here?

16:56.599 --> 16:57.766
To kill us!

16:57.767 --> 16:59.143
Kill...

16:59.144 --> 17:00.728
or test.

17:00.729 --> 17:04.023
He left the crank to let us in.
He wants us to be here!

17:04.024 --> 17:06.567
Maybe he's
an awful person, Todd!

17:06.568 --> 17:07.693
Maybe he wants to see

17:07.694 --> 17:09.153
that we have something
that no one else has.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.529
The Everbulb!

17:10.530 --> 17:11.906
Find an open socket. Now!

17:18.788 --> 17:20.706
Ah!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.542
I got it, got it!
Give me the bulb!

17:29.924 --> 17:31.383
It didn't work!

17:31.384 --> 17:33.093
Why plug in a bulb
that lights itself?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.012
Because it's not a bulb.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.264
The bulb is a key--
It's a doorknob!

17:53.782 --> 17:55.033
Nicely done, Todd.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.454
How are we going
to get out of here?

18:00.455 --> 18:03.123
This is another one
of those chambers.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.958
There must be another door
down there somewhere.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.043
Wait, Todd,

18:06.044 --> 18:08.670
what if there's another
killer machine?

18:08.671 --> 18:11.423
We cannot just
walk blindly into it--

18:11.424 --> 18:13.509
Wait,
"We can't just walk blindly?"

18:13.510 --> 18:15.094
You're saying this?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.929
Come on,
I'm getting out of here,

18:16.930 --> 18:19.139
whether the Spring family
likes it or not.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.100
T-Todd?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.062
You're close to your brother.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.022
We're related.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.982
And he's close to Dirk Gently.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.651
"Close" might be pushing it.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.153
Why did Todd steal our dog?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.199
Are you high right now?

18:38.076 --> 18:40.119
You know, your brother
is yea-close to a warrant,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.537
and, really, so are you.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.706
Aiding. Abetting.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.168
Probable cause.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.461
You are.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.964
You are high.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.427
Hello, Amanda.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.263
Everything okay?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.973
I think so.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.558
What did he ask you?

19:02.559 --> 19:03.767
<i>I'm not gonna lowball this...</i>

19:03.768 --> 19:05.436
he's being really weird.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.108
Join me outside.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.526
Ma'am, I think we'd--

19:12.527 --> 19:14.069
Join me...

19:14.070 --> 19:15.530
outside.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.498
You don't get to--

19:27.792 --> 19:29.751
What's your interest here?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.044
Ma'am, I should ask
the questions--

19:31.045 --> 19:32.171
- The Patrick Spring case?
- Yes.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.589
Todd Brotzman is on your radar.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.300
- Yes--
- First time you ever knew about his sister?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.801
You're gonna need
to lose the tone.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.219
I don't respond well to--

19:39.220 --> 19:40.262
Your safety's off.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.221
What?

19:41.222 --> 19:42.306
Wrong side.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.017
And your holster is on backwards.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.477
Oh, shit!

19:49.272 --> 19:50.523
You're so cool.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.319
Loitering at a suspect's residence?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.614
Unsupervised interrogation
of a suspect?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.033
Where's your partner?

20:01.951 --> 20:04.579
Who are you... really?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.083
You know, when I first read

20:10.084 --> 20:12.169
you were Spring's bodyguard
when he died,

20:12.170 --> 20:13.754
I assumed you were going to be
a lot of help to us,

20:13.755 --> 20:17.549
but you know what,
now I see it.

20:17.550 --> 20:21.303
Now I see what stopped you
from going the agency route.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.349
The psychological portion.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.101
I...

20:28.102 --> 20:29.311
I was just--

20:29.312 --> 20:30.896
Being careful, right?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.522
The same type of being careful

20:32.523 --> 20:33.899
that led to you
being refused entry

20:33.900 --> 20:34.983
into the Army Rangers,

20:34.984 --> 20:36.193
the F.B.I.,

20:36.194 --> 20:37.945
Naval Intelligence.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.614
"Paranoid. Panic-prone.
Unstable."

20:40.615 --> 20:43.992
Christ, you just laid hands
on a federal agent!

20:45.954 --> 20:47.996
You need help.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.040
I--! You don't--!

20:50.041 --> 20:53.293
Look, those situations
were complicated,

20:53.294 --> 20:54.962
and just...

20:54.963 --> 20:56.630
Give me back
my goddamn gun right now,

20:56.631 --> 20:58.174
and I won't have you arrested.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.272
I'm not your enemy here.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.233
If things get
any more confusing,

21:16.234 --> 21:18.986
give me a call.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.239
Maybe we can
untangle this together.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.960
Todd, there's really no need
to be in such a rush.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.004
- I'm not rushing.
- Yes, I think you are.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.381
- Caution is the order of the day--
- Shh!

21:43.845 --> 21:45.054
Okay, that's a problem.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.600
Okay, walls not closing in.
That's good.

21:51.853 --> 21:52.895
There has to be
a way out of here.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.732
Oh, what is this?

21:56.733 --> 21:58.692
No, no, don't touch that.
You don't know what it does.

21:58.693 --> 21:59.609
It might be important.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.570
Everything is a trap, okay?

22:01.571 --> 22:04.115
- Oh, interesting, a rhino.
- A rhino?

22:04.907 --> 22:06.783
Oh, it's a door!
Let's go--

22:06.784 --> 22:07.784
No, slow down!

22:07.785 --> 22:10.078
We should think about this
and take a minute, okay?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.955
- No, just... Todd!
- What is your deal?

22:11.956 --> 22:14.750
You're the one who keeps
dragging me into these situations,

22:14.751 --> 22:17.336
and then, when shit hits the fan,
you fall apart.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.296
It's not like I know things
are going to end up this way.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.380
Okay, maybe
I should see a trend, but--

22:20.381 --> 22:23.008
Look, Dirk, I'm just
trying to deal

22:23.009 --> 22:25.052
with the realities
that you keep dragging me into.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.053
You climbed a fence,

22:26.054 --> 22:27.637
you cranked a thing,

22:27.638 --> 22:29.598
you fell into the... thing.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.849
Let's not reinvent the truth.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.975
That fence was not climbed,

22:31.976 --> 22:34.102
just... ambitiously fondled.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.314
You created
this situation, yes, no?

22:37.231 --> 22:38.982
Yes.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.484
We almost just died.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.694
We almost just got
crushed to death.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.529
So stop making jokes
and acknowledge that,

22:44.530 --> 22:47.074
not in panic, but to me,
as a person.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.076
Okay?

22:49.619 --> 22:52.037
I'm sorry, Todd.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.247
Thank you.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.459
Amanda needs me,

22:57.460 --> 22:58.710
and you've trapped me in a...

22:58.711 --> 22:59.920
death maze.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.714
You keep calling me
your assistant, and I'm not that,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.842
but I will help you if it means
getting out of here, so calm down.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.427
- I feel reassured.
- Excellent.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.515
Yes, despite your use of the
alarming term "death maze,"

23:11.516 --> 23:13.141
I think you're getting good at this.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.268
Wow, really?
That's great.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.561
- Good.
- Very good.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.730
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.025
It's locked.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.861
Are you're surprised by that?

23:24.862 --> 23:26.864
I hope you're not smiling.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.922
So, is my brother
still in a hole five blocks away?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.050
I don't want
to leave you alone.

23:48.428 --> 23:53.306
The F.B.I. agent
is still down there in his car.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.352
I need to be sure
of your safety before I can leave.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.149
What did your brother do?

24:02.150 --> 24:03.942
Todd didn't do anything.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.155
The F.B.I. doesn't come knocking
for people who didn't do anything.

24:09.407 --> 24:12.076
Do we need a lawyer
or something?

24:17.748 --> 24:20.125
Are you gonna help me figure out
this door over here, or what?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.043
No, it's something
to do with this horn.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.129
There must be some kind of
un-lock-y type puzzle to solve,

24:24.130 --> 24:25.755
Like, like...

24:25.756 --> 24:28.133
Like, what's the opposite
of a horn?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.218
Or-- Ooh, maybe
it rhymes with "horn,"

24:30.219 --> 24:32.596
that'd be pretty, uh,
archaeological, right?

24:32.597 --> 24:34.556
Maybe we're not
supposed to be here.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.600
Maybe this was supposed
to be for Farah, or--

24:36.601 --> 24:39.352
- No, we're on the right track.
- How can you know that?

24:39.353 --> 24:41.605
I always end up
exactly where I need to be,

24:41.606 --> 24:43.148
despite the fact it's rarely
where I intended to go.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.733
Sometimes, you just say stuff,

24:44.734 --> 24:46.485
and it's like
you're just saying stuff.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.154
Todd, you're not making sense.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.031
What's this?

24:52.658 --> 24:54.618
"Here lies Pepe.

24:54.619 --> 24:57.037
Unless otherwise activated."

24:57.038 --> 24:58.246
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:58.247 --> 24:59.414
Pepe...

24:59.415 --> 25:01.082
Pepe!

25:01.083 --> 25:02.709
The family rhino.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.711
That belonged to Patrick Spring,
not Edgar.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.838
So he's been down here.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.510
It was Patrick who left us the key,
or crank, or whatever.

25:15.306 --> 25:16.599
That's the door.

25:17.058 --> 25:18.683
It's opening.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.101
All I had to do
was touch this thing!

25:20.102 --> 25:22.896
- Hey, wait--
- Oh, now you say wait.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.189
I thought you were all
gung-ho now, Todd.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.816
I'm gung-ho, not suicidal.
We have to see what it--

25:26.817 --> 25:28.443
Oh, come on, Todd,

25:28.444 --> 25:30.696
it's just a bloody door,
it's not going to--

25:45.378 --> 25:47.671
Take it off!

25:47.672 --> 25:49.465
It burns! I'm burning!

25:56.764 --> 25:58.139
What the hell is that thing!

25:58.140 --> 26:00.642
- Pepe.
- Pepe!

26:00.643 --> 26:02.686
Energy, some kind of a...

26:02.687 --> 26:04.729
electrical ghost rhino? I...

26:04.730 --> 26:06.356
"Electric ghost?"

26:06.357 --> 26:08.942
How do we get out of here?
If that thing charges again...

26:11.862 --> 26:13.238
You had to say that.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.782
Think!
What are we missing?

26:15.783 --> 26:16.659
Ooh!

26:20.788 --> 26:23.456
Todd, the horn,
we have to connect the horn!

26:23.457 --> 26:25.250
We can't connect that.
It's too big, it won't fit.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.836
Wait, Todd, help me with this!
It's stuck fast!

26:27.837 --> 26:28.461
Connect...

26:28.462 --> 26:30.130
Wait, connect the horn.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.965
Dirk, grab my hand!

26:31.966 --> 26:33.675
What are you talking about?

26:33.676 --> 26:36.637
Please, just trust me,
I know what I'm doing!

26:40.808 --> 26:42.393
- I think.
- What?

26:50.568 --> 26:51.944
Is it gone?

26:56.198 --> 26:57.533
He's gone.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.631
How did you know
that would work?

27:13.174 --> 27:15.175
Conductivity.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.676
Connect the rhino
to the horn.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.721
Do you have a lot of secret
scientific knowledge you aren't sharing?

27:19.722 --> 27:21.181
I used to play
the electric guitar.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.599
How many times have you
electrocuted yourself?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.726
Enough.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.978
Well, I hope you're
not claustrophobic.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.606
No, I don't even like coffee.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.399
<i>What about Brotzman and Gently?</i>

27:31.400 --> 27:33.652
They weren't home.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.195
Stuck it out,
but the woman was there.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.072
<i>Protecting the sister.</i>

27:37.073 --> 27:38.782
This is spiraling out of control.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.910
This has been spiraling
out of control!

27:42.787 --> 27:44.037
Don't be ridiculous.

27:44.038 --> 27:45.039
I'll be there soon.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.544
<i>Something wrong?</i>

27:52.630 --> 27:54.547
I just...

27:54.548 --> 27:57.467
I... I lost my dog.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.805
Nothing I can't handle.
Here, just open...

28:02.098 --> 28:03.224
Open your present.

28:05.393 --> 28:06.435
Gordon.

28:13.693 --> 28:14.902
What is this?

28:15.986 --> 28:17.821
It was made by an artisan
in Tibet.

28:17.822 --> 28:19.948
Yak fur.

28:19.949 --> 28:23.119
Meant to symbolize
the endless cycle of the universe.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.996
That's Lux's story.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.126
This is Lux's coat.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.758
Do you want to know
what happened to Lux?

28:39.468 --> 28:42.012
Where he went, what he did?

28:43.931 --> 28:45.641
You loved him.

28:46.142 --> 28:47.309
<i>Come with me now.</i>

28:49.145 --> 28:51.021
I can show you everything.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.819
Is it another puzzle?

28:57.820 --> 28:59.279
Um...

28:59.280 --> 29:00.614
Dirk, I don't know about this one.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.325
Jesus...

29:04.326 --> 29:06.536
What if there's a hundred
more rooms like this?

29:06.537 --> 29:08.413
I don't think so.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.498
The brick.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.876
The Ridgely?

29:12.877 --> 29:14.085
It led us
all the way back.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.378
Everything is connected,

29:15.379 --> 29:16.922
and I think this is the end.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.886
I am perfectly qualified.

29:22.887 --> 29:24.471
I was in contention--

29:24.472 --> 29:26.890
What does he know?
He's a...

29:26.891 --> 29:29.393
He's a stupid little
know-nothing not-knower.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.939
You're kind of
a weird person, huh?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.941
No, I'm not.
I'm a normal person.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.861
Yeah, but you're weird, too.
You're like a weird normal.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.822
I am a perfectly regular person,

29:42.823 --> 29:45.200
who can blend seamlessly
in with others.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.786
I'm not weird, or strange,

29:47.787 --> 29:48.995
and even if you think I am,

29:48.996 --> 29:51.080
you're-- you're confused,

29:51.081 --> 29:52.750
you're just very confused.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.505
- Clearly.
- Yeah.

30:00.549 --> 30:01.842
F.B.I. guy's finally leaving.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.067
Shouldn't we call
Todd and Dirk?

30:20.027 --> 30:21.110
<i>This is it.</i>

30:21.111 --> 30:22.695
<i>There was another thingie
just like this thingie</i>

30:22.696 --> 30:24.906
in the secret lab
at the Webb Mansion, Todd.

30:24.907 --> 30:28.576
This plug thingie,
it's the same... thingie!

30:28.577 --> 30:30.912
This must be the thingie
that allowed Edgar Spring

30:30.913 --> 30:32.915
to power Springsborough.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.004
Well, certainly not
what it's doing now.

30:47.721 --> 30:48.722
What does this mean?

30:49.932 --> 30:51.767
I have no idea.

30:54.854 --> 30:55.980
"Kitten..."

31:00.734 --> 31:01.694
"Shark."

31:03.571 --> 31:05.280
How did you..?

31:05.281 --> 31:06.990
The kitten and the shark.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.284
Of course,
so that means...

31:09.285 --> 31:10.619
Of course?
What "of course"?

31:11.245 --> 31:12.246
Dog.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.206
Girl.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.291
This makes sense.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.293
It does?

31:20.921 --> 31:22.381
Well, it did until right now.

31:25.301 --> 31:25.967
Unless...

31:25.968 --> 31:28.469
One... Three...

31:28.470 --> 31:29.930
Three questions, one answer.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.561
How could you have
possibly known that?

31:36.145 --> 31:37.146
It's a map!

31:41.150 --> 31:41.984
What was that?

31:42.484 --> 31:44.068
Uh... this is bad.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.113
It's too damaged.
The room is broken!

31:47.323 --> 31:49.950
Todd, look,
I'm not freaking out.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.916
They're still not picking up.

32:00.628 --> 32:01.961
I should go.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.673
What's happening?
What's wrong?

32:05.674 --> 32:07.343
I think I'm having an attack.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.802
What should I do?

32:09.803 --> 32:11.555
I smell fire.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.058
Me too.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.315
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

32:26.862 --> 32:29.447
Is this the front
of the building?

32:29.448 --> 32:30.324
Uh...

32:43.170 --> 32:44.712
Todd?

32:44.713 --> 32:46.465
<i>Todd, is that you?</i>

32:47.383 --> 32:49.759
<i>Farah! Farah!
We're trapped in here!</i>

32:49.760 --> 32:52.137
Break through the wall!

32:53.180 --> 32:54.722
- Farah, what's happening?
- They're trapped.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.641
Todd, get down!

33:09.905 --> 33:11.906
Amanda, stay back.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.908
<i>It's okay, I know these guys.</i>

33:13.909 --> 33:14.910
<i>What?</i>

33:21.750 --> 33:22.751
Todd!

33:33.345 --> 33:35.681
Oh, no, not this again.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.447
- Tasty.
- So tasty.

33:52.448 --> 33:53.574
<i>I needed that.</i>

33:54.825 --> 33:56.493
Who are those guys?!

34:00.414 --> 34:02.916
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened to you.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.126
Being burnt alive?

34:05.127 --> 34:06.419
Almost burnt alive.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.420
It's so punk.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.088
Too bad about your jacket.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.633
- I'll live.
- I was talking to Todd.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.343
The way you made it sound,

34:14.344 --> 34:17.638
that maze was made
for you specifically.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.058
That's impossible.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.602
Edgar Spring must've built
the power node and the maze

34:22.603 --> 34:24.395
for his Unlimited Energy Device,

34:24.396 --> 34:27.231
but the traps were
all Patrick's doing.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.485
Why would he do that?
Why would he send us down there?

34:30.486 --> 34:32.403
Maybe it was for you, Farah,

34:32.404 --> 34:34.072
maybe we did something wrong.

34:34.073 --> 34:34.947
What about the map?

34:34.948 --> 34:37.533
What map?
Map to the power node?

34:37.534 --> 34:38.701
No, a new map.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.161
How many freaking maps
is this guy doing?

34:40.162 --> 34:42.497
He's mapping way too much.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.165
It showed up right before
the place started to blow.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.458
I mean, it was just a second--

34:45.459 --> 34:48.044
Wait, there was a map,

34:48.045 --> 34:50.379
on, like, a bunch of screens?

34:50.380 --> 34:53.842
Yes, but only for a second.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.062
Gnarly.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.397
Hey, Amanda...

35:08.398 --> 35:09.650
Wait!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.488
There's something here.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.574
Like a... a socket.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.868
Will this fit?

35:37.719 --> 35:39.263
Holy shit.

35:41.849 --> 35:44.058
How did you know
to do that?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.268
Hunch.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.894
Wildly suspicious.

35:46.895 --> 35:47.896
Yeah, and yours aren't?

35:52.526 --> 35:53.943
No...

35:53.944 --> 35:55.070
No way.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.990
So how could he possibly
know our names?

35:58.991 --> 36:01.075
This is Skagit Valley.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.869
It's four hours from here.

36:02.870 --> 36:03.995
A treasure map.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.371
We leave first thing
in the morning.

36:05.372 --> 36:06.540
"We?"

36:07.040 --> 36:09.083
Right.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.212
I suppose it could be
very dangerous, couldn't it?

36:14.882 --> 36:16.592
I guess we'll see.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.514
<i>Gordon, this place is weird.</i>

36:23.515 --> 36:25.975
Come on.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.643
There you go.

36:27.644 --> 36:28.729
There's Lux.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.318
This is all Lux's stuff.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.198
Oh...

36:47.122 --> 36:48.831
What did you do to him?

36:48.832 --> 36:51.918
We found this thing,
in the '60s.

36:51.919 --> 36:56.422
It came to us from
another dimension or something.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.216
And then-
and then we figured out

36:58.217 --> 37:00.384
that we could swap bodies
with it.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.930
<i>We started
with animals at first.</i>

37:03.931 --> 37:06.390
It was a spiritual thing.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.434
But then we realized,

37:08.435 --> 37:11.562
we could kidnap rich people
and swap bodies with them,

37:11.563 --> 37:13.481
and then, when they outlived
their usefulness,

37:13.482 --> 37:16.901
we'd just kill them
and swap back.

37:16.902 --> 37:20.821
<i>Mostly, it was retired folks,
but then we got ambitious.</i>

37:20.822 --> 37:27.161
Athletes, and famous actors,
and, uh...

37:27.162 --> 37:29.164
rock stars.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.209
We've been doing this
for, uh...

37:33.210 --> 37:36.045
Christ, for 50 years.

37:36.046 --> 37:36.963
You're crazy.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.509
You're saying that Lux
was one of these people.

37:43.679 --> 37:46.056
I jumped into him
after the second album.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.517
I was the comeback.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.769
Wait...

37:51.770 --> 37:54.855
you never even met the real Lux.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.440
He was long gone by then.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.151
He was not even...
I don't know...

37:59.778 --> 38:00.486
I... I gotta leave.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.364
No, no, no. Not yet.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.449
What?

38:05.284 --> 38:07.953
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.583
You, Fred...

38:14.001 --> 38:16.502
No. No...

38:16.503 --> 38:19.298
You did good today.

38:20.173 --> 38:23.009
I'm not mad.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.970
I brought you here,
I brought all of you here

38:25.971 --> 38:30.975
to show you
that I am doing my part.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.977
I brought all of you here

38:32.978 --> 38:38.108
to show you that what
they say about me isn't true.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.903
<i>This is crazy...</i>

38:43.405 --> 38:45.948
See, Spring's Machine

38:45.949 --> 38:47.825
is, uh...

38:47.826 --> 38:52.247
is within our grasp.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.334
<i>Oh... Oh, yeah.</i>

38:57.377 --> 38:59.087
Within our grasp.

38:59.796 --> 39:02.423
We know where they are,

39:02.424 --> 39:04.425
where they all are.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.261
The detective,
the bodyguard,

39:07.262 --> 39:09.263
the bellboy,
his sister...

39:09.264 --> 39:11.390
<i>We will find
that other machine.</i>

39:11.391 --> 39:13.185
This is our destiny!

39:15.520 --> 39:18.148
That's why
I brought her here today...

39:25.030 --> 39:27.490
To show you...

39:27.491 --> 39:31.703
I've outgrown all these things.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.752
I don't want the things
that Lux wanted anymore.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.883
I am taking back control!

39:52.724 --> 39:53.725
Sammy...

39:57.396 --> 40:00.147
Do you remember

40:00.148 --> 40:02.483
when we were together
on that yacht

40:02.484 --> 40:04.236
off the coast of Portugal?

40:04.820 --> 40:05.946
<i>Do you remember?</i>

40:12.577 --> 40:13.537
Sammy...

40:14.413 --> 40:16.747
Do you remember
when you still loved me?

40:18.583 --> 40:21.878
Before I was all...this.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.434
Do you remember what I told you?

40:36.435 --> 40:38.602
"When I die,

40:38.603 --> 40:40.147
you die."

40:40.772 --> 40:41.189
Yes.

40:43.567 --> 40:44.651
Lux?

40:46.111 --> 40:47.446
What happened to you?

40:53.827 --> 40:54.995
I died.
