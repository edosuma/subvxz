00:01.634 --> 00:01.968
This is th

00:01.968 --> 00:03.937
the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.172
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.343
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.878
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.413 --> 00:15.482
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.316 --> 00:17.517
Yikes!

00:18.084 --> 00:19.652
Yaaaah...

00:22.222 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.693
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.536
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.971 --> 00:39.372
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.842 --> 00:45.345
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.945 --> 00:47.614
the Raccoons!!

00:47.614 --> 00:47.814
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.828 --> 01:04.564
Trees are what make up
the Evergreen forest.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.599
But today, the forest
is filled with talk

01:06.599 --> 01:08.468
of a different kind of tree,

01:08.468 --> 01:10.003
family trees,

01:10.003 --> 01:12.005
and like the giants
of the forest,

01:12.005 --> 01:15.975
the roots of family trees
can grow very deep indeed.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.244
Pig3 (as Lady Baden-Baden):
And, as chair woman

01:18.244 --> 01:20.814
of the Whose-Who Committeee,

01:20.814 --> 01:25.385
I would be thrilled to have
your prestigious family tree

01:25.385 --> 01:27.420
listed in our book.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.924
Yours truly,
Lady Baden-Baden.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.394
I'm not doing this
to thrill some committee!

01:34.394 --> 01:38.064
A lot of important people with
money will read that book!

01:38.064 --> 01:40.867
When I walk into
that party of hers tonight,

01:40.867 --> 01:43.236
I want admiration, respect,

01:43.236 --> 01:44.804
business contacts!

01:44.804 --> 01:46.906
Contacts mean contracts

01:46.906 --> 01:49.409
and contracts mean money!

01:49.409 --> 01:52.779
Pop! Lady Baden-Baden
is here to see you.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.049
Lady B.B.: Oh Cyril,
how nice to see you!

01:56.049 --> 01:59.085
Oh hello,
Lady Baden-Baden.

01:59.085 --> 02:02.255
How's that Whose Who? book
of yours coming along?

02:02.255 --> 02:04.090
Keeping you pretty busy I guess?

02:04.090 --> 02:05.391
Lady B.B.: Oh, yes it is has,

02:05.391 --> 02:07.760
but i've enjoyed
every moment of it.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.030
Why, I just found out the Sneers
were one of the first

02:11.030 --> 02:14.067
to leave the old country
and settle here.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.737
One of the Sneer's
greatest tax dodges!

02:17.737 --> 02:21.374
Lady B.B.: Yes, I'm sure it was.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.610
However, I came to tell you
that you're missing

02:23.610 --> 02:27.747
some very important documents
regarding Cedric and yourself.

02:27.747 --> 02:31.985
And as such, I simply can't
include the Sneers in the book.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.486
Aaaaaah!

02:33.486 --> 02:35.555
You're fitting me for a suit,

02:35.555 --> 02:38.324
not surgery,
you pin-headed porkers!

02:38.324 --> 02:40.326
Not in the book? Now,

02:40.326 --> 02:43.296
let's be reasonable here,
Lady Baden-Baden.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.799
I'll get those documents to you
later, what's the big deal?

02:46.799 --> 02:49.269
Lady B.B.: I'm afraid
without those documents,

02:49.269 --> 02:52.172
the last several generations
of the Sneers

02:52.172 --> 02:55.041
officially do not exist.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.211
Sorry, but rules are rules.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.747
However, there is
one possibility.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.715
Anything!
Lady B.B.: Well...

03:02.715 --> 03:04.951
I don't want to get your hopes up,

03:04.951 --> 03:08.354
but if you can give me
a tiny bit of information,

03:08.354 --> 03:10.423
i'll see if the
registration office

03:10.423 --> 03:12.692
can get us copies of
the missing documents.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.061
Oh, come on
Lady Baden-Baden.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.063
Lady B.B.:
The deadline is tonight.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.432
Now, parent's names?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.935
Gosh,
they were always just

03:21.935 --> 03:24.070
mom and dad, yes to me.

03:24.070 --> 03:27.006
Ha ha! The old memory's shot.

03:27.006 --> 03:30.810
Lady B.B.: Well, I'm sorry then,
but there's just no way.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.313
There is one way
you can find out, Pop!

03:33.313 --> 03:35.448
The Sneer library!

03:35.448 --> 03:37.684
Lady B.B.:
What an excellent suggestion!

03:37.684 --> 03:41.221
I'll expect that information
for me by tonight.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.957
Well, ta ta,
it's tea time for me.

03:43.957 --> 03:48.027
Don't worry Pop, we can
find everything in the library.

03:58.471 --> 04:01.741
Not everything...
is in the library.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.479
You know,
when I volunteered

04:06.479 --> 04:07.914
to help with the Who's-Who,

04:07.914 --> 04:10.917
I never realized there
would be so much to do.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.486
Volunteering can be
a lot of thankless work.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.588
No, this is fascinating!

04:15.588 --> 04:17.624
Right now, I'm checking out
the Sneer family.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.092
you should come have a look.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.560
Thanks,
but I don't generally

04:20.560 --> 04:22.562
have any trouble
getting to sleep.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.398
Besides, I am the
official printer!

04:25.398 --> 04:28.935
And they hired the best
for the job, Ralphie boy.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.070
He volunteered.
I did not!

04:31.070 --> 04:33.072
I was... railroaded,

04:33.072 --> 04:35.375
but it's a very prestigious job.

04:35.375 --> 04:39.178
All this work just to
create a giant gossip magazine.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.748
it's not a
gossip magazine Bert.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.150
It'll give everyone an
opportunity to see

04:44.150 --> 04:45.685
just where they came form.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.054
And it's all very
carefully verified.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.822
Well, here's something else

04:49.822 --> 04:52.625
that needs careful
verification--

04:52.625 --> 04:57.063
a recipe for peanut butter
apple surprises.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.399
Hey,
now that's the job I'd like--

04:59.399 --> 05:02.302
sorry Ralph,
but Cedric already volunteered.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.904
He's going to cook it
after we go pick the apples.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.205
See ya', guys!

05:06.205 --> 05:07.540
You know what's funny?

05:07.540 --> 05:11.144
Climbing in here and
bringing the wrong screwdriver?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.280
No. In all these books,

05:14.280 --> 05:16.349
I can't find any reference

05:16.349 --> 05:18.785
to Cyril or Cedric.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.488
Pig1: How could the boss
do this to us?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.124
Forget the names
of his own parents?

05:25.124 --> 05:28.761
Pig3: Well, he always
forgets our payday.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.197
Hiya Cedric,
ready to go apple picking?

05:31.197 --> 05:33.132
Sorry Bert, I can't.

05:33.132 --> 05:37.236
I'm searching for the lost
past of the Sneer family.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.805
Yeah?
hey,

05:38.805 --> 05:41.240
I think I found
what i'm looking for,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.176
'The Sneer dynasty.'

05:43.176 --> 05:46.412
Ohh, the last few
pages are missing!

05:46.412 --> 05:48.414
That's really strange.

05:48.414 --> 05:52.785
Ah, a mystery.
I love mysteries!

05:52.785 --> 05:54.120
Don't worry, Cedric,

05:54.120 --> 05:58.024
Bert raccoon, ace detective
is on the case.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.226
We'll solve this in no time.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.329
Gee Bert we don't
have a lot of time for that.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.331
There's got to be another way.

06:05.331 --> 06:08.167
let's see, if we
cross-reference what we have,

06:08.167 --> 06:10.370
with the information
in these volumes,

06:10.370 --> 06:13.005
and index the dates
with these books,

06:13.005 --> 06:14.674
Then we could corroborate using

06:14.674 --> 06:16.609
the known events in this book...

06:16.609 --> 06:18.177
we just might get lucky!

06:18.177 --> 06:20.446
Huh! Great plan Cedric, yeah.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.849
I don't know why
I didn't think of it.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.885
Pig1: Ooo!

06:25.885 --> 06:29.489
Hey, this could be the key to
unlock the boss's memory

06:29.489 --> 06:32.558
and save us a lot of
work too. Come on!

06:37.163 --> 06:38.331
Nothin'!

06:38.331 --> 06:41.634
I'm starting to think someone
erased your past, Cedric.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.736
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong places...

06:43.736 --> 06:47.473
maybe, one of the Sneers
was a deep cover spy

06:47.473 --> 06:51.010
and everything's
classified 'Top Secret!'

06:51.744 --> 06:54.380
Or maybe, one of you
was an alien

06:54.380 --> 06:57.617
and you've got no past
on this planet!

06:57.617 --> 07:00.119
Oh, I don't think so, Bert.

07:00.119 --> 07:03.523
Hmm, Excalibur Sneer.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.426
Heh heh. Do you mind
if I borrow this?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.194
With this little baby,

07:08.194 --> 07:11.063
I'd cut to the heart
of the conspiracy,

07:11.063 --> 07:14.033
that has stolen the past
from Cedric Sneer.

07:14.033 --> 07:18.171
Then, I'd raise the mighty sword
of Sir Bert and say...

07:18.171 --> 07:20.373
Bert, could you keep
the noise down a bit?

07:20.373 --> 07:22.809
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.544
Hey!

07:27.447 --> 07:28.548
Huh?

07:30.016 --> 07:32.018
Hey! Cedric!

07:32.018 --> 07:34.921
Open up, Cedric!

07:34.921 --> 07:39.225
Born 1698,
Reginald de la Sneer.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.763
Wonder if his friends
called him Reggie, huh Bert?

07:43.763 --> 07:47.633
...heh heh heh heh. Bert?
Oh well.

07:50.903 --> 07:55.408
Pig2: You're getting sleepy,
very sleepy...

07:55.408 --> 08:00.480
Pig3: You can't hypnotize
someone with an iron will.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.418
Pig2: So far, so good!
Ha ha! What's next?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.321
Pig1: When a person is in
a deep hypnotic trance,

08:08.321 --> 08:12.291
he is often able to recall
the most trivial details.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.827
How much monopoly money
do you collect

08:14.827 --> 08:17.597
for finishing second
in a beauty contest?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.132
Pig3: Ten dollars.

08:20.132 --> 08:23.903
Pig2: Oh wow! This hypnosis
stuff really works!

08:23.903 --> 08:26.239
Now, if we can convince
the boss to try it,

08:26.239 --> 08:28.608
we can get him to
remember everything!

08:28.608 --> 08:30.276
Pig1: Hey listen to this...

08:30.276 --> 08:32.512
key words can sometimes be used

08:32.512 --> 08:35.348
to trigger post-hypnotic
suggestion.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.784
Okay, whenever you
hear the word 'Sneer,'

08:38.784 --> 08:41.354
you will... bark like a dog.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.055
Now, snap out of it.

08:43.055 --> 08:44.457
Pig3: I told you it...

08:44.457 --> 08:47.026
Pig2: Sneer!
Pig3: (barking) wouldn't work!

08:47.026 --> 08:49.095
Pigs1/2: Hahaha!

08:49.095 --> 08:50.930
You know Broo,
you could hide

08:50.930 --> 08:53.199
a lot of bodies back here...

08:53.199 --> 08:56.769
so don't go looking
for any bones, okay?

08:56.769 --> 08:59.238
Hey, hey look, a light!

09:03.342 --> 09:05.845
Hey guys, we're in here!

09:08.681 --> 09:11.417
If we get asked
to stay for lunch,

09:11.417 --> 09:13.486
the answer is 'No' okay?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.687
Yap! Yap!

09:19.892 --> 09:23.195
Help! There's probably a zombie,

09:23.195 --> 09:26.632
or someone's old
grandmother locked in here.

09:26.632 --> 09:30.570
But if we have to go,
at least we go together.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.011
Aaaaaaah!

09:39.011 --> 09:40.479
Oof!

09:41.113 --> 09:43.583
You okay, Broo?
Ruff!

09:46.485 --> 09:48.020
Don't make a sound Broo,

09:48.020 --> 09:50.923
or we're going to
end up as zombie food!

09:52.024 --> 09:53.993
Huh? Cyril?

09:53.993 --> 09:57.763
Hey, things are starting
to add up here.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.231
Shhh - listen!

10:00.433 --> 10:01.901
Sorry Cedric,

10:01.901 --> 10:05.171
I almost got up the courage
to tell you this time.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.407
Those must be the missing
papers from the library,

10:08.407 --> 10:11.177
but why does he have
to hide them in here?

10:11.177 --> 10:14.547
This is mighty strange.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.386
C. Sneer, ad--huh?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.727
Broo, Cedric's adopted!

10:28.894 --> 10:31.364
Lady Baden-Baden:
Yoo hoo! Cyril!

10:31.364 --> 10:33.532
Cyril Sneer!

10:35.601 --> 10:37.503
Oh, there you are Cyril!

10:37.503 --> 10:40.139
Any luck locating
the missing documents?

10:40.139 --> 10:43.409
Yes, I-I-I just finished...

10:43.409 --> 10:44.877
found them, actually.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.114
Lady B.B.: Oh my!
The ink is still wet!

10:48.114 --> 10:49.615
Cyril; Is it?
Lady B.B.: Oh!

10:49.615 --> 10:51.450
You silly rascal!

10:51.450 --> 10:54.387
Surely there's not
a problem, is there?

10:54.387 --> 10:57.256
No, no just a...
little joke.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.625
Lady B.B.:
Very amusing, but you're wasting

10:59.625 --> 11:02.161
valuable time on jokes.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.463
I thought
you might say that,

11:04.463 --> 11:08.234
so I prepared some more
extensive documentation.

11:08.234 --> 11:12.438
Lady B.B.:
Cyril, there's $3,000 in here!

11:12.438 --> 11:14.273
Is this a bribe?

11:14.273 --> 11:16.008
No! No no, it's a...

11:16.008 --> 11:18.110
uh..uh..heh heh...

11:18.110 --> 11:20.012
Lady B.B.: A contribution then?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.314
Yes..that's it..uh,

11:22.314 --> 11:24.016
for the Who's-Who fund.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.918
Lady B.B.: How sporting of you!

11:25.918 --> 11:29.155
But we'll still need the
documentation by 6 o'clock.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.525
Now what?

11:32.525 --> 11:36.762
Ahh ha!
Now we're getting somewhere!

11:36.762 --> 11:38.931
Montgomery Sneer,

Admiral in the King's navy 1812.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.005
Broo, if Cedric
keeps digging around,

11:46.005 --> 11:49.608
he's sure to find out
he's adopted... from a book!

11:49.608 --> 11:52.511
We can't let him
find out that way.

11:52.511 --> 11:57.149

Ceeedriiic!!!

13:16.362 --> 13:18.030
This is hopeless!

13:18.030 --> 13:21.700
Come on Broo, we have to keep
looking for a way out of here!

13:21.700 --> 13:22.968
Yap, yap.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.272
Pig2: Do you really think the
boss will let us hypnotize him?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.641
Pig1: Listen,
we've studied this book,

13:28.641 --> 13:33.112
we have the watch and nearly an
hour of hands-on experience.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.147
Hey, what's this?

13:35.147 --> 13:38.284
Pig2: You'll see! He'll thank us
for giving him a helping hand

13:38.284 --> 13:40.519
to remember the
names of his parents.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.954
Pig3: Gee, i don't know.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.557
Things just don't feel right.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.194
Aaaahhh!
Pig1: It's alive!!

13:48.194 --> 13:50.796
Pig2: Oooh!
The paintings are alive!!

13:50.796 --> 13:52.965
Aaaaaahhh!

13:52.965 --> 13:55.568
It's the revenge of the
Sneer ancestors!

13:57.102 --> 13:59.572
Phew! We're out Broo!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.841
Finally out!

14:01.841 --> 14:04.076
I can't stall anymore,

14:04.076 --> 14:06.011
There's no way out of this.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.680
Aaahh!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.682
I have to talk to Cedric.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.617
Pigs 2,3: Aaaahhh!

14:11.617 --> 14:12.952
Ooof!

14:14.253 --> 14:16.856
Ouch.. ooo.. ah.. oooh.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.459
Pig2: The boss is sure going to
be upset when he comes around!

14:20.459 --> 14:21.927
Pig1: But what if he

14:21.927 --> 14:23.729
'doesn't' come around?

14:23.729 --> 14:25.865
Pig3: Oh, i'm not so sure
the boss is going to like

14:25.865 --> 14:29.001
being put in a trance
without his permission.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.003
Pig1: Maybe you'd
prefer the boss

14:31.003 --> 14:32.805
put us in traction?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.841
Pig3: Heh heh. Well,
when you put it that way...

14:35.841 --> 14:38.043
Ooh...

14:38.043 --> 14:41.647
Pig1: You're getting sleepy...
you're getting sleepy!

14:41.647 --> 14:44.316
Pig2: Ooh, very sleepy.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.785
Pig1: Now, we can get him
to remember his past.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.421
Pig2: Ho hoo! He might
even give us a raise!

14:49.421 --> 14:52.892
Pig3: The condition he's in,
he'd give us anything! Heh heh.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.694
Hee hee hee!

14:55.694 --> 14:58.297
Pig1: And the key word is
'please.'

14:58.297 --> 15:01.901
When I snap my fingers,
you will remain in a trance,

15:01.901 --> 15:05.504
but will open your eyes
and do only as we say.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.041
Pig2: Ask him! Ask him!

15:09.041 --> 15:13.178
Pig1: Ahem. boss, we would
like a raise, please!

15:13.178 --> 15:17.283
Pig3: Mom always said the
magic word works wonders.

15:17.283 --> 15:21.020
Pig2: Let's go...
shopping!!!

15:21.020 --> 15:24.490
This is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.258
Uh, Mr. Sneer?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.560
I've gotta talk to you.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.429
I know Cedric is adopted.

15:31.397 --> 15:35.200
Mr. Sneer? Don't you think
Cedric's got a right to know?

15:35.200 --> 15:38.404
Won't you please talk to him?

15:40.205 --> 15:44.310
Cyril Sneer!!
How could you sink so low?

15:44.310 --> 15:46.679
Do you think money
can buy my silence,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.547
to my dear pal Cedric?

15:48.547 --> 15:52.351
Well, you've got a lot to
learn about Bert Raccoon!

15:52.351 --> 15:54.019
Come on, Broo!

15:58.023 --> 15:59.925
Stop and open the door!

15:59.925 --> 16:02.761
Hee hee!
This hypnosis stuff is great!

16:02.761 --> 16:04.530
Pig3: Stand aside!

16:04.530 --> 16:06.231
Pig2: Please!

16:06.231 --> 16:08.067
Oh hohohohoh!!

16:08.067 --> 16:09.969
You can never have
too much. Ho ho!

16:09.969 --> 16:12.271
Pig1: Shut the door,
get in and drive!

16:12.271 --> 16:16.075
Pig3: Oh, it's soo hard to
get good help these days.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.310
You have to tell them
everything!

16:18.310 --> 16:21.880
Drive! Hahahha!

16:23.315 --> 16:25.584
You know,
that Who's Who book

16:25.584 --> 16:29.121
is not the most important thing
in the whole universe.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.256
Of course it isn't Bert, but...

16:31.256 --> 16:34.893
A lot of the stuff in
there might be kind of private.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.429
Maybe some things are
better left alone, you know.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.766
Not everybody wants their
past held up to the world.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.801
Are you trying to
tell us something, Bert?

16:42.801 --> 16:44.503
Well, yyya.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.472
What i'm trying to say is...

16:46.472 --> 16:49.808
well, Cedric is my best friend,

16:49.808 --> 16:51.810
and he's..he's...

16:51.810 --> 16:53.912
Not a Sneer.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.248
He's adopted.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.085
It's okay Bert,
I heard you and Pop

17:00.085 --> 17:01.954
talking about my adoption.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.655
Aw, Cedric,

17:03.655 --> 17:06.425
I didn't want you
to find out this way!

17:06.425 --> 17:08.660
Yeah, but I did Bert.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.929
You mean, you had no idea?

17:10.929 --> 17:13.032
Well, Cyril must have had

17:13.032 --> 17:15.134
a good reason not to tell you.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.903
It doesn't change anything,
does it Cedric?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.471
I don't know.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.674
Pig2: Oh hoho. Ohh,
the life of leisure -

17:22.674 --> 17:24.843
caviar, potato chips,

17:24.843 --> 17:27.446
and everything else
that money can buy!

17:27.446 --> 17:29.715
Pig3: And a raise!

17:29.715 --> 17:32.051
Pig1: Driver!
Keep to the left up here.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.486
Pig3: Did we include
a paid lunch hour?

17:34.486 --> 17:37.356
Pig1: Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.391
Shut the privacy window, driver!

17:39.391 --> 17:42.027
Pig3:
Ya, and crank up the tunes!

17:44.229 --> 17:45.798
Pig1: Oops!

17:45.798 --> 17:47.132
Aaahh!

17:47.132 --> 17:49.835
Pig1: You absent-minded
aardvark, get back on the road!

17:49.835 --> 17:52.571
Aaaahhh!

17:54.373 --> 17:56.508
are you sure you
feel like doing this?

17:56.508 --> 17:58.377
Bert, I'm fine.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.879
I'm adopted, not sick.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.148
Well okay, but uh,

18:03.148 --> 18:05.884
remember uh,
just pick the good ones!

18:05.884 --> 18:09.688
The recipe doesn't call for
any worms you know! Hehehe.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.827
Hey, just a couple more Cedric!

18:14.827 --> 18:18.163
Cedric?
Are you okay up there, Cedric?

18:18.163 --> 18:22.234
You know Bert,
my pop picked me!

18:22.234 --> 18:25.070
Out of all the kids
he might have chosen,

18:25.070 --> 18:27.272
he picked me!

18:27.272 --> 18:30.709
Yeah, well that's
how adoption works Cedric.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.412
So, why don't you
come down, huh?

18:33.412 --> 18:35.514
We have enough apples.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.883
So, I must have been...

18:37.883 --> 18:39.251
a good one!

18:39.251 --> 18:42.121
Of course
you're a good one, Cedric!

18:42.121 --> 18:44.289
Hey, it's Pop!

18:44.289 --> 18:45.891
There you go.

18:45.891 --> 18:49.895
He's probably coming straight
over here to talk things over.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.132
Maybe. But he's
not coming straight!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.766
Look out Bert!

18:54.766 --> 18:56.101
Aaaaaahhh!!

18:56.101 --> 18:57.736
Aaaaahh! Whoa!

18:59.771 --> 19:01.306
What's going on?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.909
Come on Bert!
And bring the ladder!

19:04.743 --> 19:07.646
Pig1: Oh no!
We're really doomed!

19:07.646 --> 19:11.049
Pig3: Yeah, the boss
hates a dirty car!

19:11.550 --> 19:14.219
Help! Help!
Someone save us!

19:14.219 --> 19:16.088
What in the blue blazes?

19:16.088 --> 19:18.790
He he. Hi boss!

19:18.790 --> 19:21.660
Let it down easy!
Hold it steady Bert!

19:21.660 --> 19:24.563
Where's Pop?
Pig1: In the front seat.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.166
Pop! Answer me!
Pop! Pop!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.968
Cedric,
get me out of here!

19:29.968 --> 19:33.839
Pooooooop!

19:34.773 --> 19:37.743
Cedric!
Get me out of here!

19:38.577 --> 19:41.980
Move back Pop!
I'm going to smash the sunroof!

19:41.980 --> 19:43.849
Cedric, here catch!

19:46.585 --> 19:48.620
Let's go Pop! Hurry!

19:51.990 --> 19:54.927
Whew. I thought
I'd lost you there Pop.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.163
We Sneers don't
disappear as easily as that.

19:58.163 --> 20:01.500
and we've got hundreds of years
of history to prove it, son!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.302
I know that Pop,

20:03.302 --> 20:06.305
even if I'm not a real Sneer.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.373
What are you talking about?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.875
It's okay Pop,

20:09.875 --> 20:12.477
you don't have to keep it
a secret anymore.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.213
I know i'm adopted.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.649
Where-where'd you get
that crazy idea?

20:17.649 --> 20:20.552
No wait.
You're not adopted son...

20:20.552 --> 20:21.687
huh?

20:21.687 --> 20:23.555
I'm the one who's adopted.

20:23.555 --> 20:27.059
Cyril Sneer - adopted?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.661
Pig3: Does that make
our contract invalid?

20:29.661 --> 20:32.297
Come on, son,
let's go home.

20:32.297 --> 20:35.067
There's a few things
you and I should talk about.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.336
That sounds good, Pop.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.305
So Lady Baden-Baden,

20:40.305 --> 20:42.641
we're in the Who's Who book?

20:42.641 --> 20:44.209
Great!

20:44.209 --> 20:46.979
Where was I now? Oh yes...

20:46.979 --> 20:49.748
Well son, times
were different then.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.818
Being adopted was
sometimes kept a secret.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.187
But why
couldn't you tell me?

20:55.187 --> 20:56.888
Well, I wanted to,

20:56.888 --> 20:59.024
but I kept putting it off.

20:59.024 --> 21:02.160
The longer I waited,
the harder it got.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.895
I guess I was afraid

21:03.895 --> 21:06.565
you'd think
I wasn't a real Sneer.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.401
Gee Pop,
as far as I'm concerned,

21:09.401 --> 21:12.104
you're the greatest Sneer ever!

21:13.038 --> 21:16.675
Thanks son.
That means a lot to me.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.746
Pig1: Did you hear that boys?
Ha!

21:20.746 --> 21:22.748
We don't even get mentioned!

21:22.748 --> 21:26.518
Pig2: Ya! And we've been
behind him all the way!

21:26.518 --> 21:29.421
Pig3: And pushed him to the top.

21:29.421 --> 21:33.125
Hurry it up! The Who's
Who party is about to start,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.094
and everyone's
waiting for the Sneers!

21:36.094 --> 21:37.629
Pig3:

21:37.629 --> 21:38.964
Remind me to check

21:38.964 --> 21:41.300
