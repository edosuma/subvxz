THE MOOD HERE
IS ONE OF FESTIVITY

01:10.384 --> 01:12.870
AS WE AWAIT
THE BIG MARDI GRAS PARADE,

01:13.100 --> 01:14.720
AND, OF COURSE
AT MARDI GRAS TIME,

01:14.976 --> 01:16.520
EVERYONE IS IN COSTUME.

01:17.422 --> 01:19.808
WHOA, BABE, NOT
EVERYONE, OK?

01:20.155 --> 01:22.134
<i>WE'RE HERE
AU NATUREL.</i>

01:22.864 --> 01:25.888
THAT'S A WRAP, VERNON. LET'S MOVE
TO THE JEWELRY STORE LOCATION.

01:26.484 --> 01:28.837
THAT WAS QUITE
ADEQUATE, APRIL.

01:29.134 --> 01:31.666
NOW, LET'S GET
READY TO--YEOW!

01:32.084 --> 01:35.408
WHERE DID YOU PEOPLE EVER GET
THOSE UGLY TURTLE COSTUMES?

01:35.783 --> 01:38.767
PROBABLY THE SAME PLACE
YOU GOT THAT UGLY MASK!

01:39.199 --> 01:40.476
BUT I'M NOT WEARING--

01:40.775 --> 01:42.426
NOW JUST A DARN MINUTE!

01:42.754 --> 01:44.364
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A SEC, VERNON.

01:44.984 --> 01:46.824
YOU FELLAS REALLY
SHOULD BE IN COSTUME.

01:47.206 --> 01:48.405
HEY, IT'S MAJOR
FUN FOR US

01:48.727 --> 01:50.132
JUST TO BE ABLE
TO WALK AROUND

01:50.132 --> 01:52.026
WITHOUT
EVERYONE STARING.

01:52.364 --> 01:53.869
WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE?

01:54.130 --> 01:55.943
I'M A 17th-CENTURY
NOBLEWOMAN

01:56.207 --> 01:58.222
<i>RIGHT OUT OF
THE THREE MUSKETEERS.</i>

01:58.572 --> 02:01.661
<i>UH, DON'T YOU MEAN
THE THREE MOSQUITOES?</i>

02:02.069 --> 02:04.624
<i>THE THREE MUSKETEERS,
THE BOOK BY DUMAS.</i>

02:04.861 --> 02:06.502
YOU FELLAS
SHOULD READ IT.

02:06.809 --> 02:09.324
APRIL, I'M NOT
GETTING ANY YOUNGER!

02:09.616 --> 02:10.997
OR ANY NICER.

02:11.286 --> 02:12.489
SEE YOU GUYS.

02:13.223 --> 02:16.123
THIS PORTION IS BROUGHT
TO YOU BY FEIFFER JEWELS,

02:16.469 --> 02:18.123
WHICH IS CURRENTLY
DISPLAYING

02:18.353 --> 02:20.683
THE PRICELESS STAR
OF BRAZIL DIAMOND.

02:20.978 --> 02:23.744
THIS ENORMOUS JEWEL
WAS RECENTLY UNEARTHED

02:24.008 --> 02:25.862
IN THE WORLD'S
DEEPEST MINE.

02:27.385 --> 02:28.276
THE FOOLS!

02:28.993 --> 02:31.052
THAT STONE IS IMPERVIUM,

02:31.416 --> 02:34.423
THE LOST ELEMENT
OF DIMENSION X.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.423
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, LOST?

02:36.715 --> 02:39.103
DO YOU HAVE TIME
FOR A FLASHBACK?

02:39.384 --> 02:40.287
WHY NOT?

02:40.755 --> 02:44.770
IT WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT
WITH DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL.

02:45.031 --> 02:46.480
WE WERE ATTEMPTING
TO SEND

02:46.800 --> 02:49.897
THE ONLY KNOWN SAMPLE
OF IMPERVIUM TO EARTH.

02:50.288 --> 02:54.109
WE NEVER FOUND OUT WHERE
THE IMPERVIUM LANDED

02:54.407 --> 02:55.857
UNTIL NOW.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.602
WHAT MAKES THIS
IMPERVIUM SO VALUABLE?

03:00.037 --> 03:02.364
IT'S THE HARDEST
KNOWN SUBSTANCE

03:02.615 --> 03:04.358
IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY.

03:04.689 --> 03:09.210
WITH IT, I COULD CREATE
WEAPONS NEVER BEFORE SEEN.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.706
ROCK STEADY,
BEBOP,

03:13.064 --> 03:14.265
GO STEAL
THAT IMPERVIUM

03:14.530 --> 03:16.059
AND BRING IT
BACK HERE.

03:18.670 --> 03:20.896
LITTLE DOES
SHREDDER REALIZE

03:21.210 --> 03:25.043
THAT HAVING THE IMPERVIUM
WILL MAKE ME INVINCIBLE.

03:25.597 --> 03:28.749
WITH IT POWERING
THIS FORCE FIELD GENERATOR,

03:29.006 --> 03:32.783
NO WEAPON IN THE UNIVERSE
CAN TOUCH ME!

03:41.315 --> 03:43.716
DUDES, THIS
GRAPE JELLY PIZZA

03:44.106 --> 03:46.117
IS RIGHTEOUSLY
AWESOME.

03:46.335 --> 03:47.305
IT'S THE PERFECT SNACK

03:47.514 --> 03:50.952
<i>FOR WATCHING REVENGE OF THE
POLKA DOT SLIME, PART V.</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:53.592
GUYS, YOU'VE GOT
TO READ THIS BOOK.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.412
SOME CROOK STEALS THE
QUEEN'S DIAMONDS, OK?

03:56.693 --> 03:58.767
AND D'ARTAGNAN HAS
TO GET THEM BACK.

03:59.176 --> 04:02.033
COOL OUT, LEONARDO.
THIS IS THE BEST PART.

04:02.487 --> 04:05.509
THESE MUSKETEERS WERE
INSEPARABLE JUST LIKE US,

04:05.850 --> 04:10.039
AND THEIR MOTTO WAS "ALL
FOR ONE AND ONE FOR--" HEY!

04:10.424 --> 04:11.888
IT'S GONNA BE
A FREE-FOR-ALL

04:12.143 --> 04:13.671
IF YOU DON'T
PIPE DOWN!

04:14.011 --> 04:15.652
OK. I GET THE MESSAGE.

04:18.428 --> 04:21.861
I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPOSE THEM
TO GREAT LITERATURE, MASTER.

04:22.215 --> 04:24.044
DO NOT GIVE UP,
LEONARDO.

04:24.419 --> 04:26.650
IT TOOK YOUR HERO
D'ARTAGNAN MUCH TIME

04:26.977 --> 04:28.969
TO GAIN
THE MUSKETEERS' RESPECT.

04:29.249 --> 04:31.794
I WISH PEOPLE
RESPECTED US.

04:32.012 --> 04:33.792
HEY, MASTER, THAT'S IT!

04:34.164 --> 04:38.299
FOUR MUSKETEER OUTFITS?

04:38.864 --> 04:41.372
I'M SURE THE COSTUME
DEPARTMENT HAS SOME.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.588
SURE, I CAN ARRANGE IT.

04:43.790 --> 04:46.433
THANKS, APRIL. MAYBE
THEY'LL HELP MAKE PEOPLE

04:46.433 --> 04:48.345
TREAT US
WITH MORE RESPECT.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.495
IRMA, I HAVE
A PARADE TO COVER!

04:53.793 --> 04:55.935
OH, APRIL! WHAT WOMAN
DOESN'T HAVE TIME

04:55.935 --> 04:57.892
TO BROWSE THROUGH
A JEWELRY STORE?

04:58.173 --> 05:01.106
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE.

05:02.681 --> 05:04.635
THIS HAS
GOT TO BE THE PLACE.

05:05.117 --> 05:06.960
HEY, IT'S ROCK
STEADY AND BEBOP.

05:07.161 --> 05:08.627
QUICK, GET DOWN!

05:09.874 --> 05:12.748
THIS IS APRIL
CALLING THE TURTLES.

05:13.341 --> 05:15.433
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
UH, GENTLEMEN?

05:15.879 --> 05:18.255
WE CAME FOR
THAT BIG ROCK.

05:18.582 --> 05:20.811
IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO THE STAR OF BRAZIL,

05:21.074 --> 05:23.169
I'M SORRY, BUT
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

05:23.543 --> 05:24.916
OH, NO PROBLEM.

05:25.183 --> 05:26.911
WE DON'T
WANT TO BUY IT.

05:28.283 --> 05:29.813
WE WANT TO STEAL IT.

05:30.393 --> 05:32.337
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY!
ROCK STEADY AND BEBOP

05:32.556 --> 05:34.963
ARE HOLDING UP
FEIFFER'S JEWELRY STORE.

05:39.638 --> 05:43.334
NO, YOU CANNOT HAVE THE STAR
OF BRAZIL, AND THAT'S FINAL!

05:44.102 --> 05:45.083
OH, YEAH?

05:49.139 --> 05:50.810
WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW?

05:51.853 --> 05:54.056
WOULD YOU CARE
TO HAVE IT GIFT WRAPPED?

05:54.414 --> 05:55.474
WE GOT IT.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.052
IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT TROUBLE,

05:57.380 --> 05:58.639
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:58.936 --> 06:00.330
IT'S THE TURTLES!

06:01.696 --> 06:03.039
I'LL TAKE
THAT STONE.

06:06.426 --> 06:07.612
YOU WANT A STONE?

06:07.844 --> 06:08.904
HERE, SHELLHEAD.

06:14.313 --> 06:15.651
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

06:15.918 --> 06:16.794
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.386
WE'VE DONE
ENOUGH BROWSING.

06:19.211 --> 06:20.630
MY COSTUME IS CAUGHT!

06:23.627 --> 06:25.404
WOW! WHAT'S THIS?

06:26.418 --> 06:27.636
IMAGINE THROWING AWAY

06:27.898 --> 06:29.662
A GORGEOUS DIAMOND
LIKE THIS.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.752
SOME PEOPLE
ARE SO WASTEFUL.

06:32.114 --> 06:33.458
LEONARDO IS HURT.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.465
COME ON, AMIGO.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.762
WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE PIZZA.

06:38.226 --> 06:40.099
LEONARDO'S HURT?

06:40.494 --> 06:41.798
LEONARDO!

06:42.161 --> 06:43.624
LEONARDO,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:45.932 --> 06:47.088
QUITE ALL RIGHT...

06:47.513 --> 06:49.192
YOUR MAJESTY.

06:49.522 --> 06:52.062
YOUR MAJESTY?
WHY'D YOU CALL ME THAT?

06:52.461 --> 06:54.888
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
CALL THE QUEEN?

06:55.153 --> 06:56.744
THE QUEEN?
THE QUEEN?

06:57.072 --> 06:59.695
IF SHE'S A QUEEN,
THEN WHO ARE WE?

07:00.151 --> 07:02.023
YOU ARE MY FRIENDS.

07:02.329 --> 07:05.619
ATHOS, PORTHOS,
AND ARAMIS, OF COURSE.

07:05.950 --> 07:07.959
THE THREE MUSKETEERS!

07:08.165 --> 07:10.648
OH, SWELL. THEN WHO,
PRAY TELL, MIGHT YOU BE?

07:10.925 --> 07:14.284
WHY, I'M D'ARTAGNAN,
NATURALLY.

07:15.493 --> 07:20.205
LOOKS LIKE OUR HEAD
DUDE JUST CAME UNGLUED.

07:25.011 --> 07:25.980
<i>TELL US, SENSEI.</i>

07:26.372 --> 07:27.586
HOW IS LEONARDO?

07:27.903 --> 07:29.134
HE IS RESTING COMFORTABLY.

07:29.475 --> 07:31.282
IN TIME,
HIS MEMORY SHOULD RETURN.

07:31.734 --> 07:35.184
COME, MY COMRADES. THERE ARE
WRONGS TO BE RIGHTED

07:35.184 --> 07:37.022
AND DAMSELS TO BE SAVED,

07:37.635 --> 07:40.485
AND YOU MUSKETEERS
AREN'T EVEN DRESSED.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.015
MY FAULT, GUYS.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.296
I PUT THE COSTUMES
APRIL SENT OVER

07:45.651 --> 07:46.761
IN LEONARDO'S ROOM.

07:47.072 --> 07:48.801
CLEVER MOVE, BRAINIAC.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.236
ACTUALLY, DONATELLO DID
THE RIGHT THING.

07:51.611 --> 07:54.701
YOU MUST HUMOR HIM BY
PUTTING ON THESE COSTUMES.

07:54.949 --> 07:56.510
PRETEND
WE'RE MUSKETEERS?

07:56.819 --> 07:58.225
BOGUS, DUDE.

07:58.572 --> 08:01.035
LOOK, I'D GIVE LEONARDO
THE SHELL OFF MY BACK, OK?

08:01.252 --> 08:03.639
BUT I'M NOT WEARING LACE WITH
FEATHERS, AND THAT'S FINAL.

08:03.904 --> 08:04.905
SAME HERE.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.027
DITTO.

08:06.836 --> 08:08.427
I FEEL
PRETTY STUPID.

08:08.964 --> 08:10.288
SAME HERE.

08:10.595 --> 08:11.670
DITTO.

08:12.014 --> 08:14.540
YOU, LAD.
OUR LODGINGS ARE A MESS.

08:14.759 --> 08:16.304
CLEAN THEM UP LIKE
A GOOD FELLOW.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.707
BUT I AM NOT A SERVANT.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.110
<i>I AM YOUR SENSEI.</i>

08:20.816 --> 08:22.285
REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID--

08:22.533 --> 08:24.104
WE MUST HUMOR HIM.

08:25.262 --> 08:28.148
AS YOU WISH,
MASTER D'ARTAGNAN.

08:29.056 --> 08:30.379
UH, LISTEN,
D'ARTAGNAN.

08:30.691 --> 08:32.171
ABOUT THAT DIAMOND...

08:32.486 --> 08:35.476
THE DIAMOND! OF COURSE!

08:35.476 --> 08:36.746
I VOWED TO THE QUEEN

08:36.746 --> 08:38.883
I WOULD FIND
HER STOLEN JEWEL.

08:39.376 --> 08:41.642
COME, ATHOS,
PORTHOS, ARAMIS!

08:41.936 --> 08:44.527
ONE FOR ALL
AND ALL FOR ONE!

08:46.202 --> 08:49.579
WHOA! WAIT FOR US,
DUDE D'ARTAGNAN.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.954
STOP THIS TANTRUM AND
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

08:57.440 --> 09:03.270
WHAT'S WRONG?
I GAVE YOU A VITAL MISSION,

09:03.491 --> 09:06.512
AND YOU SENT THOSE 2
ANT-BRAINED MUTANTS

09:06.512 --> 09:08.384
TO BOTCH THIS UP.

09:11.258 --> 09:13.376
LOOK, I CAN'T GO
RACING TO THE SURFACE

09:13.705 --> 09:16.123
EVERY TIME YOU WANT
SOME SILLY BAUBLE.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.325
WHAT'S THAT?
SILLY BAUBLE?

09:19.325 --> 09:22.346
I COULD GENERATE
AN IMPENETRABLE FORCE FIELD.

09:23.251 --> 09:25.205
I'LL GIVE YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE

09:25.470 --> 09:27.962
TO GET THAT IMPERVIUM GEM,

09:28.340 --> 09:31.520
AND THIS TIME,
DON'T FAIL.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.686
I'M THROUGH
TAKING ORDERS.

09:37.014 --> 09:38.746
ONCE I GET
THAT IMPERVIUM GEM,

09:39.086 --> 09:41.177
IT IS I WHO'LL BE
INVINCIBLE.

09:43.128 --> 09:44.793
HOW COME WE'RE SWIPING

09:44.793 --> 09:46.859
THE FORCE FIELD
GENERATOR, BOSS?

09:47.525 --> 09:48.742
BECAUSE I'LL NEED IT

09:49.011 --> 09:51.534
ONCE I GET MY HANDS
ON THAT IMPERVIUM GEM.

09:51.849 --> 09:55.503
AND REMEMBER, NOT A WORD
OF THIS TO KRANG.

09:59.568 --> 10:01.395
OH, THIS IS SO GORGEOUS.

10:01.674 --> 10:03.861
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY
WOULD TOSS THIS AWAY.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.684
HELLO.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.286
IRMA, GET DOWN TO THE
PARADE ROUTE PRONTO!

10:10.583 --> 10:11.974
I NEED YOU
TO RUN A CAMERA.

10:12.204 --> 10:13.349
BUT, MR. THOMPSON,

10:13.703 --> 10:17.042
I'M A SECRETARY,
NOT A CAMERA OPERATOR.

10:17.374 --> 10:19.302
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE
IN 10 MINUTES FLAT,

10:19.507 --> 10:21.633
YOU WON'T BE
EITHER ONE!

10:21.877 --> 10:23.925
WELL, SINCE YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY...

10:24.297 --> 10:27.634
WELL, D'ARTAGNAN,
DOES THIS JEWELRY STORE

10:27.634 --> 10:29.572
BRING BACK
ANY MEMORIES?

10:29.988 --> 10:31.613
HMM. IT CERTAINLY DOES.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.705
I REMEMBER THIS PLACE
WELL.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.058
HEY, IT WORKED! I
KNEW HE'D REMEMBER.

10:37.289 --> 10:38.556
THIS IS WHERE
WE FOUGHT

10:38.786 --> 10:41.291
THE HENCHMEN
OF RICHELIEU.

10:41.579 --> 10:45.514
LET'S FIND
THOSE WRETCHED KNAVES.

10:46.995 --> 10:48.477
OH, WE'VE BEEN
ALL OVER THIS STREET

10:48.851 --> 10:52.109
AND THERE AIN'T A TRACE
OF THAT STUPID IMPERUVIA...

10:52.455 --> 10:53.780
EMPERAVA...

10:54.174 --> 10:55.307
THAT GEM.

10:55.732 --> 10:59.459
I THINK SOME LOUSY CROOK
MUST HAVE STOLE IT.

11:00.489 --> 11:02.421
WE MEET
AGAIN, SCOUNDRELS.

11:03.301 --> 11:04.000
WHA--?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.901
WHO IS THIS CREEP?

11:06.230 --> 11:09.175
AH, JUST ONE OF THEM
JERKS FROM THE PARADE.

11:09.175 --> 11:10.990
I AM D'ARTAGNAN.

11:11.344 --> 11:12.764
EN GARDE, VILLAINS.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.326
OOH, LET'S
FLATTEN THIS FLAKE.

11:21.141 --> 11:22.988
<i>BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME,
MON AMI.</i>

11:23.298 --> 11:24.578
I GOT TO TRY THAT.

11:24.888 --> 11:26.430
IT'S AN EXCELLENT TACTIC.

11:26.849 --> 11:27.992
EN GARDE!

11:29.383 --> 11:31.455
MORE OF
THEM POINTY THINGS.

11:31.796 --> 11:33.920
WE BETTER
WARN THE BOSS.

11:36.224 --> 11:37.660
WE MUSTN'T LOST THEM!

11:37.660 --> 11:39.497
THEY MUST KNOW
WHERE THE DIAMOND IS.

11:39.497 --> 11:40.951
THIS WAY!

11:41.421 --> 11:43.614
THE FIRST FLOAT
IN OUR MARDI GRAS PARADE

11:43.614 --> 11:45.239
IS NOW COMING
INTO VIEW.

11:45.552 --> 11:47.987
IRMA, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE AIMING THE CAMERA,

11:47.987 --> 11:50.166
NOT BUFFING
YOUR TACKY JEWELRY.

11:50.433 --> 11:54.147
I CAN'T HELP IT, VERNON.
IT'S SO GORGEOUS.

11:54.675 --> 11:57.295
WHERE DID THOSE NITWITS
DROP THAT IMPERVIUM?

11:58.030 --> 11:59.748
WHY IS THIS CITY SO BIG?

12:00.291 --> 12:03.193
THAT BLASTED IMPERVIUM GEM
COULD BE ANYWHERE.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.096
THIS NEXT FLOAT REPRESENTS
PROGRESS IN PETROLEUM.

12:08.405 --> 12:11.716
IRMA, YOU'RE
AIMING THE CAMERA BACKWARDS.

12:12.256 --> 12:15.460
LET'S SEE IF THE PARADE'S
ON THE TUBE.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.472
LOOK, THERE'S
THE QUEEN'S DIAMOND

12:18.472 --> 12:20.464
ON THE LADY
IN THAT BOX!

12:20.820 --> 12:23.398
THAT BELONGS TO
HER MAJESTY, WENCH!

12:23.629 --> 12:25.393
HEY, COOL IT,
D'ARTAGNAN.

12:25.594 --> 12:27.938
THAT'S IRMA, AND SHE'S
NOT INSIDE THAT BOX.

12:28.188 --> 12:29.946
DONATELLO,
GET US TO THE PARADE,

12:29.946 --> 12:32.571
AND I'M TALKING
WARP SPEED.

12:35.817 --> 12:39.072
IT'S TAKING SHREDDER
AN AWFULLY LONG TIME

12:39.072 --> 12:41.089
TO LOCATE
THAT IMPERVIUM GEM.

12:41.629 --> 12:44.577
HE BETTER NOT
BE DOUBLE-CROSSING ME.

12:44.891 --> 12:46.287
WHAT, SOLDIERS?

12:46.576 --> 12:48.324
I WANT THE FORCE FIELD
GENERATOR

12:48.606 --> 12:50.029
GUARDED DAY AND NIGHT.

12:52.878 --> 12:53.783
IT'S GONE!

12:54.318 --> 12:57.151
THAT METAL-FACED MONGREL
STOLE IT.

12:57.621 --> 12:58.903
FOLLOW ME.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.445
HI THERE.
I LOVE YOUR COSTUME.

13:02.723 --> 13:05.504
I KNOW A VILLAIN WHO
WEARS ONE JUST LIKE IT.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.019
AND I LOVE
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING--

13:08.019 --> 13:11.447
THE GEM! AT LAST
IT'S ALL MINE!

13:11.866 --> 13:14.708
PLEASE, WE'VE ONLY
JUST MET.

13:14.953 --> 13:16.749
LET'S NOT RUSH THINGS.

13:17.014 --> 13:20.399
IT'S SHREDDER! POOR IRMA DOESN'T
KNOW THE DANGER SHE'S IN.

13:20.617 --> 13:23.300
POOR IRMA? HOW
ABOUT POOR HIM?

13:23.518 --> 13:26.107
IRMA, TELL THAT GOON
TO PUT YOU DOWN.

13:26.107 --> 13:28.732
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING.

13:29.043 --> 13:31.510
FORGET IT,
MR. THOMPSON.

13:31.743 --> 13:34.537
I JUST QUIT.

13:34.537 --> 13:37.231
NOW HOW DO I
GET OUT OF HERE?

13:39.545 --> 13:42.603
RICHELIEU!
WE MEET AT LAST.

13:42.603 --> 13:44.954
IT'S A TURTLE.

13:45.204 --> 13:47.107
FEAR NOT,
BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN.

13:47.373 --> 13:49.383
I WILL RESCUE YOU.

13:49.616 --> 13:51.457
IRMA? BEAUTIFUL?

13:52.772 --> 13:54.955
THE POOR GUY GOT CONKED
HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT.

13:55.219 --> 13:57.935
UNHAND HER, YOU--
YOU VARMINT!

13:58.231 --> 13:59.928
AS YOU WISH.

14:00.910 --> 14:02.539
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

14:02.829 --> 14:06.464
2 DASHING STRANGERS
DUELING OVER ME?

14:06.807 --> 14:08.281
YOU'RE THROUGH,
TURTLE.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.161
OH, MY GOSH!

14:13.332 --> 14:15.171
HANG ON, D'ARTAGNAN.

14:15.741 --> 14:20.132
DUDES, I HOPE THAT VINE'S
GOT SOME SERIOUS ROOTS.

14:22.201 --> 14:25.713
YOU'VE INTERFERED FOR
THE LAST TIME, TURTLE.

14:25.713 --> 14:27.304
EXCUSE US.
COMING THROUGH.

14:27.665 --> 14:29.178
HANG ON, D'ARTAGNAN.

14:29.690 --> 14:30.656
PARDON ME.

14:30.951 --> 14:32.670
<i>AU REVOIR,
SHELLBACK.</i>

14:32.947 --> 14:34.806
BOYS, BOYS, I KNOW
YOU'RE JEALOUS,

14:35.055 --> 14:37.428
BUT FIGHTING OVER
ME ISN'T THE ANSWER.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.830
NOT SO FAST,
RICHELIEU.

14:42.541 --> 14:44.257
STOP CALLING ME
RICHELIEU.

14:44.257 --> 14:46.335
AND STOP
JUMPING AROUND!

14:46.535 --> 14:48.520
I'VE GOT TO GET TO
THE TOP OF THAT FLOAT.

14:57.145 --> 14:59.548
COME ON. WE'RE MISSING
ALL THE FUN.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.764
YOU'LL RUE
THIS DAY, VARMINT.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.665
WHAT IS THIS STRANGE
EFFECT I HAVE ON MEN?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.662
AND HOW CAN I
MAKE IT LAST?

15:08.754 --> 15:10.489
IRMA, I'M HERE
TO SAVE YOU!

15:10.920 --> 15:13.746
SAVE? WHO WANTS TO BE SAVED?

15:14.933 --> 15:19.234
BRUSHFOUR, DeWINTER--
MY OLD FOES!

15:19.530 --> 15:21.378
WHO'S HE TALKING TO?

15:21.609 --> 15:23.214
YOU GOT ME.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.831
I THINK THIS TURTLE'S
GOTTEN SOFT IN THE SHELL.

15:28.142 --> 15:31.025
COULD BE, BUT HE
GOT US AGAIN!

15:31.260 --> 15:33.262
I'VE WASTED
ENOUGH TIME.

15:33.837 --> 15:36.361
HEY, NOT SO ROUGH,
MACHO MAN.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.362
YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME.

15:38.362 --> 15:40.700
LISTEN, THIS IS NO WAY
TO TAKE ME HOME

15:40.700 --> 15:42.074
TO MEET YOUR MOTHER.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.352
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:43.352 --> 15:45.600
THANKS FOR PROVIDING
MY ESCAPE.

15:46.334 --> 15:47.377
SHREDDER'S GETTING AWAY.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.948
WAIT FOR US, BOSS.

16:00.154 --> 16:02.620
WELL, DUDES, WE FINALLY
GET SOME RESPECT,

16:02.852 --> 16:04.539
AND THEY THINK
IT'S A SHOW.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.015
TAKE THE PRISONERS
DOWNSTAIRS.

16:09.746 --> 16:11.715
PUT US DOWN,
YOU CREEPS.

16:12.183 --> 16:13.614
SURE THING.

16:15.305 --> 16:17.890
NOW, LOOK, THIS IS NO
WAY TO START A ROMANCE.

16:18.262 --> 16:21.388
A ROMANCE? WITH YOU?
HA HA HA!

16:21.388 --> 16:23.613
I JUST WANT THAT JEWEL
YOU'RE WEARING.

16:23.962 --> 16:26.222
WELL, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU FEEL,

16:26.519 --> 16:28.684
IT'S ALL OVER
BETWEEN US.

16:29.264 --> 16:31.531
CONGRATULATIONS,
MISS O'NEILL.

16:31.821 --> 16:33.801
CHANNEL 6 WILL HAVE
EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE

16:34.097 --> 16:35.240
OF THE FIRST SPEECH

16:35.505 --> 16:39.092
GIVEN BY EARTH'S
NEW RULER, NAMELY--ME!

16:41.385 --> 16:43.801
WE LET SHREDDER
NAB APRIL AND IRMA

16:43.801 --> 16:45.626
RIGHT OUT FROM
UNDER OUR NOSES.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.547
MONDO BUMMER, DUDES.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.072
<i>DO NOT LOSE HEART,
MON AMI.</i>

16:51.353 --> 16:54.582
WE ARE STILL
THE MUSKETURTLES!

16:54.876 --> 16:56.641
LEONARDO,
WILL YOU GET REAL?

16:56.858 --> 16:58.093
WE'RE NOT MUSKETURTLES,

16:58.093 --> 17:00.981
AND YOU'RE NOT SOME GUY
CALLED D'ARTAGNAN.

17:01.961 --> 17:03.488
OH, BUT YOU ARE WRONG,

17:03.695 --> 17:06.173
AND I'LL PROVE IT WHEN
I FIND THE QUEEN.

17:07.981 --> 17:10.700
LOOK, THERE'S APRIL
AT THE STATION.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.815
APRIL?
WHAT AM I SAYING?

17:14.238 --> 17:16.467
I MEAN,
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.

17:16.717 --> 17:19.806
YOU SAID APRIL.
YOUR MEMORY IS RETURNING.

17:20.153 --> 17:23.519
I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:23.519 --> 17:25.174
I'M A MUSKETURTLE,

17:25.409 --> 17:27.371
AND IF YOU WON'T
HELP ME, I'

17:27.371 --> 17:30.570
OH, NO. NOT AGAIN.

17:30.837 --> 17:33.210
REMEMBER, YOU CANNOT
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

17:33.474 --> 17:35.251
HE MUST DISCOVER IT
FOR HIMSELF.

17:36.171 --> 17:37.270
ALL RIGHT.

17:37.543 --> 17:39.573
BEGIN REHEARSAL,
MISS O'NEILL.

17:39.873 --> 17:40.897
AND NOW,

17:41.115 --> 17:44.235
INTRODUCING THE NEW RULER
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD,

17:44.517 --> 17:46.345
EMPEROR SHREDDER.

17:47.090 --> 17:48.215
THEN I'LL SAY,

17:48.467 --> 17:52.181
"GREETINGS,
MY SUBJUGATED SUBJECTS."

17:52.978 --> 17:54.111
WHAT?

17:55.592 --> 17:57.685
SEIZE THAT TRAITOR!

17:58.593 --> 18:00.212
I CAN EXPLAIN, KRANG.

18:00.618 --> 18:04.036
I, UH, UM, I WANTED
TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE

18:04.036 --> 18:06.920
OF LUGGING THE GENERATOR
ALL THE WAY BACK HERE.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.071
HOW VERY THOUGHTFUL.

18:09.273 --> 18:13.209
PERHAPS I'LL SAVE YOU
THE TROUBLE OF GROWING OLD.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.298
I HEARD YOUR REHEARSAL.

18:15.536 --> 18:17.044
I HAVE ONE NOTE.

18:17.044 --> 18:21.458
CAST CHANGE! I WILL BE
THE RULER OF THE WORLD.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.566
HERE'S HOW IT WILL GO.

18:23.924 --> 18:25.643
PEOPLE OF THE EARTH,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.573
THE NEW EMPEROR
OF THE WORLD IS ME.

18:28.821 --> 18:30.864
RESISTANCE IS USELESS.

18:30.864 --> 18:33.004
NO WEAPON CAN HARM ME.

18:33.004 --> 18:34.689
OBSERVE.

18:35.326 --> 18:37.166
YOU TWO ATTACK ME.

18:37.399 --> 18:38.952
THAT'S AN ORDER!

18:39.224 --> 18:43.539
AND YOU SAID THIS JOB
DIDN'T HAVE ANY FRINGE BENEFITS.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.003
ME FIRST.

18:47.207 --> 18:49.445
I DIDN'T
FEEL A THING.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.535
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

18:56.062 --> 18:58.163
NOTHING CAN STOP ME.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.490
I AM INVINCIBLE.

19:03.672 --> 19:06.401
I BELIEVE
I'VE MADE MY POINT.

19:07.307 --> 19:10.441
IT'S TIME TO PUT ON
MY GOOD SUIT.

19:10.647 --> 19:12.549
HURRY UP
WITH THAT ANDROID.

19:12.549 --> 19:16.855
I'M ANXIOUS TO START
MY REIGN OF TERROR.

19:18.541 --> 19:20.399
THERE WILL BE
NO REIGN OF TERROR

19:20.399 --> 19:22.367
WHILE D'ARTAGNAN LIVES.

19:22.659 --> 19:25.860
HERE IS YOUR DIAMOND,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.339
GET THAT
IMPERVIUM GEM!

19:28.584 --> 19:30.367
LEONARDO, LOOK OUT!

19:34.944 --> 19:36.053
THANK YOU.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.463
YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THIS
ANY LONGER, EX-EMPEROR.

19:40.735 --> 19:42.572
NO! NO! IT'S MINE.

19:43.309 --> 19:46.828
WHOA-HO! THE THREE
MUSKETURTLES ARE HERE,

19:47.061 --> 19:49.478
YOU SCURVY SCOUNDRELS.

19:49.967 --> 19:53.411
OH, I FEEL SO CORNY
TALKING LIKE THAT.

19:54.959 --> 19:58.702
HEY, WHY ARE YOU GUYS
WEARING THOSE COSTUMES?

19:58.702 --> 20:00.867
YOU MADE US
PUT THEM ON, D'ARTAGNAN.

20:01.430 --> 20:04.394
WHO'S D'ARTAGNAN?
I'M LEONARDO.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.763
ARE YOU GUYS
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

20:06.763 --> 20:08.122
WE ARE NOW.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.999
TUBULOSO.
HE'S CURED.

20:10.382 --> 20:13.257
LET'S SHOW THEM WHAT
A TURTLE CAN DO.

20:13.550 --> 20:15.113
TOO LATE, REPTILES.

20:15.378 --> 20:18.572
NOW THE FORCE FIELD
WILL MAKE ME INVINCIBLE.

20:20.274 --> 20:22.307
HELP! GET ME
OUT OF HERE!

20:22.537 --> 20:26.841
YOU IDIOT! THE FORCE
FIELD WAS SET FOR MY SIZE,

20:26.841 --> 20:28.524
NOT YOURS.

20:28.745 --> 20:32.258
I KNOW, AND I'M ALL BENT
OUT OF SHAPE OVER IT.

20:32.503 --> 20:33.859
YOU'LL HATE THIS IDEA,
SHREDDER,

20:33.859 --> 20:36.271
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO
PROTECT ME.

20:36.498 --> 20:37.918
HEY, THIS
AIN'T FAIR.

20:38.733 --> 20:41.028
RETREAT, YOU MORONS,
RETREAT!

20:42.644 --> 20:44.266
HEY, DON'T LEAVE ME!

20:44.530 --> 20:46.239
YOUR ONLY WAY OUT OF HERE

20:46.239 --> 20:48.743
IS TO SHUT OFF
THE FORCE FIELD.

20:51.504 --> 20:54.140
ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE
THE LAST LAUGH.

20:55.484 --> 20:57.918
TAKE ANOTHER GUESS,
TIN-GRIN.

21:06.921 --> 21:08.547
SOMEBODY GRAB THE GEM!

21:09.058 --> 21:10.779
TOO LATE.
IT'S DOWN THE DRAIN.

21:10.779 --> 21:13.943
ALONG WITH SHREDDER AND
KRANG'S PLAN TO RULE THE WORLD.

21:14.609 --> 21:19.073
<i>PERSONALLY, I DOUBT WE'LL
EVER HAVE ANOTHER MARDI GRAS</i>

21:19.073 --> 21:21.035
<i>WITH AS MUCH EXCITEMENT
AS TODAY'S.</i>

21:21.035 --> 21:24.283
YEAH. WHICH SUITS
MY AGENDA JUST FINE.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.419
BUT WE LOST
THE IMPERVIUM GEM!

21:26.635 --> 21:29.648
ALL THAT FIGHTING,
AND ALL FOR NOTHING.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.801
NO, LEONARDO.
IT IS ALL FOR ONE...

21:33.067 --> 21:35.763
AND ONE FOR ALL!
