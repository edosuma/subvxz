WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:03.537
Previously on Outsiders...

00:03.537 --> 00:06.674
-(breathing heavily)
-Now, you run as far as you can.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.710
-And don't you never come back.
-Hey, you want to come see

00:09.710 --> 00:11.079
if you can show me
where your parents' house is?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.146
HOUGHTON:
You can't stay with me, Sam.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.482
I promise you, she's gonna
look after you, okay?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.786
(panting, groaning)

00:18.786 --> 00:21.655
-Goddamn. -I'm pregnant.
-G'WIN: You're man enough

00:21.655 --> 00:24.592
to create a life; you are man
enough to make a decision.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.395
HASIL: That child's half
a Farrell, and he's gonna be

00:27.395 --> 00:29.363
-born half a Farrell.
-SALLY-ANN: We're kind of

00:29.363 --> 00:31.799
stuck without a place to go.
If you just let us stay here

00:31.799 --> 00:34.468
a couple more days
till we figure things out.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.170
BUTCH: Look, man. I'm selling
tonight. I could use someone

00:36.170 --> 00:38.606
to watch my back.
I'll kick you a couple bucks.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.108
Easy money. What do you say?

00:40.108 --> 00:41.775
(crowd clamoring)

00:46.580 --> 00:47.815
-Times are tough.
-Yeah, well, been made tougher

00:47.815 --> 00:50.184
by that sister of yours
and her gang of bitches.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.520
Next time, chain 'em up.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.256
While you're here, I'm gonna
give you basic survival advice.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.726
Keep your head down. And be
very careful who you trust.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.163
Got something for you. A gift.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.631
From the brotherhood.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.834
Smash his skull
like a watermelon.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.702
(metal clatters on floor)

01:10.704 --> 01:12.506
You don't fool me, Farrell.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.143
There's a bloodthirsty
lion in you.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.881
(man screaming)

01:20.881 --> 01:22.516
The fire was by Kinnah hand.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.185
G'WIN:
Moregon killed Hezzy.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.786
-She's up to something.
She's got to go. -(grunts)

01:25.786 --> 01:27.888
-Will you help me?
-Always.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.758
Thou art not our Bren'in,
for we are not Farrell.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.097
(speaking native language)

01:39.767 --> 01:41.335
*

01:52.346 --> 01:55.283
Foster, we'll get
all the knives,

01:55.283 --> 01:59.153
all the arrows,
hatchets, everything.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.190
You just give us the word,

02:02.190 --> 02:03.624
we'll take them witches out.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.760
Well, you could do that.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.363
But you'd probably die trying.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.300
And you would
do it anyway, I know.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.204
But right now, the Bren'in,
she's got a gun to her head.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.771
So nobody tries nothing.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.840
What do they want
with her, anyways?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.743
You stay here. I mean it.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.552
They killed Hezzy, too.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.355
-Burnt him alive.
-This is a calamity.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.756
Never in our history
has the Bren'in

02:35.756 --> 02:37.891
been held prisoner
by our own clan.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.360
They ain't our clan.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.928
So what are you gonna do?

02:40.928 --> 02:43.431
I don't know.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.534
Yet.

02:46.534 --> 02:50.338
(country blues music)

02:50.338 --> 02:53.907
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

02:53.907 --> 02:58.546
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:58.546 --> 03:01.749
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

03:01.749 --> 03:04.552
* And they'll go running back

03:04.552 --> 03:07.721
* To the wretched realm
they came *

03:09.857 --> 03:14.962
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

03:14.962 --> 03:18.366
* And the land

03:18.366 --> 03:22.636
* Will suffer those who came.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.710
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:35.283 --> 03:37.585
(dogs barking in distance)

03:48.796 --> 03:50.464
(engine starts in distance)

03:55.336 --> 03:57.305
*

04:03.644 --> 04:05.446
(exhales)

04:31.339 --> 04:33.474
(Jager chuckles)

04:33.474 --> 04:35.509
Actions speak louder.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.910
I agree with you, Mr. Farrell.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.346
But the stench of them.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.915
I mean... (coughs): Oh!
Come on.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.884
Can't you smell it? Really?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.719
You know, I got a pretty good
sense of smell,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.888
and I don't think it was them.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.324
Maybe it's your upper lip?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.892
(laughs)

04:51.892 --> 04:53.661
You, you, my friend,

04:53.661 --> 04:57.064
you're as pure
as the driven snow.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.032
I love that phrase.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.669
Etymology: Shakespeare,
A Winter's Tale.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.938
Snow so white and pure,

05:04.938 --> 05:08.642
it's yet to be poisoned
by this wicked world.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.944
Just like you.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.948
I'm proud to have a pure being
such as yourself among us, sir.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.885
I've chosen you,
and you will join me.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.689
One, because in hell,
you don't have a choice.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.124
Two, because
you're the whitest man

05:24.124 --> 05:27.060
to shit inside these walls since
I walked in here 18 years ago.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.564
We're pure, we're clean.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.635
We share the same heart.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.604
Understand?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.846
*

06:01.895 --> 06:05.833
(door opens, closes)

06:09.637 --> 06:11.171
What do you want?

06:11.171 --> 06:13.507
I have offered you
everything we have.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.476
MOREGON:
And we are grateful.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.877
I commend you for holding fast

06:16.877 --> 06:19.012
to so many
of your generous ways.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.581
And for understanding

06:20.581 --> 06:22.583
that the modern world
has poisoned us all.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.018
We agree on that.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.854
So pardon me for my confusion.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.656
-About?
-You believe it's wrong

06:28.656 --> 06:30.190
to be dependent
on their machines.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.725
-It is.
-And yet,

06:31.725 --> 06:33.160
you've stolen our guns.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.429
Seems you're a bit dependent
on them right now.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.164
Leadership is not easy.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.900
Remaining true
to what we believe,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.169
to this mountain, this talamh,

06:42.169 --> 06:45.439
means that difficult choices
must be made.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.741
Especially when there are those
who refuse to understand.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.109
G'WIN:
Yes.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.844
I refuse to understand
that someone has to die

06:50.844 --> 06:52.613
-so that you can prove to...
-When I told you

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
we burnt the smokehouse

06:53.981 --> 06:57.050
because the meat was tainted,
what did you do?

06:57.050 --> 07:00.454
You ran straightaway to
a drunken man for help.

07:00.454 --> 07:04.658
Which confirmed
what I wish were not true:

07:04.658 --> 07:05.993
you're weak.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.529
And that we had no choice
but to steal

07:08.529 --> 07:09.963
your own fire to convince you

07:09.963 --> 07:12.065
to let us do
what we came here to do.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.567
Which is what?

07:13.567 --> 07:16.203
Cosain fuil ond fuil.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.173
"Only blood can save blood"?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.209
When our people came
to this continent,

07:22.209 --> 07:24.745
we brought with us
all the ancient rites,

07:24.745 --> 07:27.681
the ones the Christians
tried to kill.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.683
We held fast to them.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.018
And when we settled up here,

07:31.018 --> 07:33.621
safe from the so-called
Americans,

07:33.621 --> 07:34.922
we began to lose hold of them.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.189
That is why the Kinnah left.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.492
Only blood can save blood,

07:38.492 --> 07:40.628
so the strongest of you
must die.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.631
-What are you talking about?
-A purification by blood.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.232
To rid us of all the ills
you brought up

07:45.232 --> 07:47.134
onto this sacred hill.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.036
-A sacrifice.
-Tomorrow eve.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.672
-At the full moon.
-Well, it will never happen.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.676
MOREGON:
I so wanted to teach you.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.011
For you to join me,

07:58.011 --> 08:00.548
for us to save this clan
together.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.883
You're gonna kill a man
for his blood.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.518
Not me.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.520
You.

08:07.755 --> 08:11.258
Moregon, I let you
live among us.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.562
I agreed we needed to change.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.631
I sought your counsel,
but th...

08:17.631 --> 08:19.299
this is madness.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
No! It's what we believe!

08:21.268 --> 08:23.070
We are not murderers.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.538
We are a family.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.575
And your beloved husband--
isn't he a killer?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.643
And you? Didn't you try
to murder him?

08:29.643 --> 08:32.079
-You failed, but still.
-I failed

08:32.079 --> 08:33.747
because Farrells
don't kill Farrells.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.783
-I see.
-I won't do it.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.227
MOREGON: No, he is not
the strongest of you.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.296
He is just one of your family.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.666
And every hour, one will die...

08:52.666 --> 08:54.635
until you agree.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.971
So go on, tell this boy
that you're too weak

08:57.971 --> 08:59.673
to do your duty

08:59.673 --> 09:02.275
and purify this mountain
as the Bren'in must.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.918
No.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.187
-(gunshot)
-SHURN: They shot her!

09:14.187 --> 09:16.556
-They shot the Bren'in!
-(clamoring)

09:17.625 --> 09:18.992
Foster, no!

09:18.992 --> 09:21.194
You want to shoot?
Go ahead and shoot me!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.598
(gasping)

09:24.598 --> 09:25.766
(crying)

09:25.766 --> 09:28.335
(whispers):
G'Winveer.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.238
A man who is willing to die
for someone he loves.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.975
He is the strongest.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.677
(G'Win continues crying)

09:36.677 --> 09:38.145
Take him away.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.028
-Why? What number's that?
-SALLY-ANN: 600.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.363
Dollars?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.265
-For rent.
-For rent.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.668
Which is...?

10:00.668 --> 10:01.869
Are you kidding me?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.671
-No.
-You're not.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.775
Okay. So rent is money that
you pay for a place to live.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.377
Well, it just seems like
an odd notion to me, but go on.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.981
And I-- we can't
stay here anymore.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.117
Babies and bongs
don't really go together.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.953
My brother is crazy,
and "crazy" is not even the word

10:19.953 --> 10:22.389
I'd begin to use
to describe your family.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.857
We need a place of our own.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.092
-Agreed?
-I agree.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.928
Yeah. Uh, I-I agree,
no questions.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.262
What's that?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.865
That's $200,
for food, furnishings,

10:31.865 --> 10:33.767
like a bed, a table, microwave.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.435
And the rest of this stuff
is basics.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.804
Just dish soap, toilet paper.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.174
Stop.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.976
I know you know
what toilet paper is.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.113
-All right.
-And after that, we have

10:46.113 --> 10:48.348
the weekly fare for the bus,
in case we need to go anywhere,

10:48.348 --> 10:50.183
and then we have utilities.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.252
-Which are what?
-Utilities are electric,

10:52.252 --> 10:53.954
gas, water.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.856
What do you mean, water?
You pay for water?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.224
We pay for water, babe.
You know that.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.861
You got to pay for water?
Wh...

11:00.861 --> 11:02.830
Well, what about air? Hmm?

11:02.830 --> 11:05.799
How much, how much
the air cost down here?

11:05.799 --> 11:07.968
-I'm being serious.
-(scoffs)

11:07.968 --> 11:09.703
And we haven't even
gotten to the biggest one.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.438
-What's that?
-Doctor's bills.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.206
I told you,
the free clinic is closed.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.043
We're gonna have to pay
for everything out of pocket.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.344
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.813
-Yeah.
-I'd go get a payday loan,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.982
but I can't get a payday loan
if I don't have a payday.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.183
And I don't have a job.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
And, baby, neither do you.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.922
You know what? Just forget it.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.424
I-I don't even know what it is
that I'm trying to do here.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.093
-Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. -I get
that you don't understand.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.728
-Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
-And it's just...

11:34.728 --> 11:37.064
-It's too hard for me to...
-Hey. Stop, stop.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.065
Stop.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.933
It's gonna be all right.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.402
Me and Butch,
we're working on something.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.204
I'm gonna get us money.
It's gonna be fine.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.839
You and Butch are gonna get
money together?

11:45.839 --> 11:47.340
Selling drugs?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.176
That's gonna be fine?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.344
-I already told you, I'm
not bringing a baby... -Hey.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.446
-...to come visit you in jail.
-No. It ain't drugs.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.116
It ain't moonshine.
I ain't selling nothing.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.951
What, then?

11:57.951 --> 12:01.188
I just need you to trust me.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.858
-Okay?
-Okay.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.202
Hey, Sam. How are you?

12:15.202 --> 12:18.105
-Okay.
-Mm.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.340
Um, can I sit down?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.112
(sighs)

12:30.851 --> 12:33.120
Hey, um, Sam,
I found your house.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.888
It was right by the bear.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.123
Just like you said.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.993
I found your folks.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.464
Do you know what happened
to them, Sam?

12:45.833 --> 12:48.135
Can I ask you about it?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.003
Anything you saw that you want
to tell me about,

12:50.003 --> 12:51.471
you can tell me about it.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.206
You don't have to be scared.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.975
This is a great place
and you're real safe here.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.378
-He told me not to look.
-Somebody told you not to look?

12:58.378 --> 13:01.849
-The big man.
-A big man?

13:01.849 --> 13:04.117
Was he a friend of your parents?
Did they know him?

13:04.117 --> 13:07.020
-He was a stranger?
-Yeah.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.057
What'd he look like, Sam?

13:10.057 --> 13:13.894
He was big, long hair,
and, um...

13:13.894 --> 13:17.164
-What do you mean, Sam?
You mean like tattoos? -Mm-hmm.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.167
Sam, uh...

13:20.167 --> 13:22.335
I'm gonna...

13:22.335 --> 13:23.971
I'm gonna show you
a photograph, okay?

13:23.971 --> 13:26.539
It's not scary.
I just want you to tell me

13:26.539 --> 13:28.441
if this is the man
that you saw.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.147
Is that him?

13:34.147 --> 13:37.550
More old with long white hair.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.489
He's a big guy?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.457
Older guy? Long white hair?

13:47.394 --> 13:50.030
-Did he tell you his name?
-Mm.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.202
LEDDA: Well, okay. Let's talk
about the Coal Days Festival.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.403
(crowd murmurs)

13:56.403 --> 13:58.538
I think that we need
some new ideas.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.009
I see a lot of new faces
here today, which is great.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.544
-Anybody? -Well, won't we have
a booth set up near the parade?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.313
LEDDA:
We will, but I think

14:06.313 --> 14:08.615
-that we can do better
than that, don't you? -Yes.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.150
You mean you want to do
an action there?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.651
-Yes I do.
-Like what?

14:11.651 --> 14:14.021
-That's what we're here
to sort out. -POLLY: Ledda,

14:14.021 --> 14:17.557
Coal Days is something everybody
in this town loves. Right?

14:17.557 --> 14:20.593
I mean, my kids look forward
to that parade for months.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.396
-I know and so do mine.
-POLLY: We just did an action.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.233
Not the most popular thing
I've ever been involved with.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.602
And now you want to go really
pissing everybody in town off

14:29.602 --> 14:31.571
by ruining their summer fun?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.074
That's not gonna get us
any likes.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.109
Pardon me, but, uh...

14:36.109 --> 14:38.045
it's not about the likes.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.247
-Hi, everybody.
-Hi.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.915
My name is Gordon.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.017
I'm not from here,
but I heard about you guys

14:44.017 --> 14:45.953
from all the way
across the country.

14:45.953 --> 14:49.156
You guys are amazing,
just amazing.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.423
Well, thank you.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.092
When I saw that video,

14:52.092 --> 14:55.628
and your courage
and your passion--

14:55.628 --> 14:57.297
you're my hero.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.299
Seriously.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.235
So, look, I'm just here to help,
if you need me.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.337
I've worked on
a lot of campaigns:

15:04.337 --> 15:06.439
fracking in Pennsylvania,
tar sands pipeline,

15:06.439 --> 15:07.574
deforestation.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.309
And if you don't mind me saying,

15:09.309 --> 15:13.013
an action at the Coal Days
Festival, a real action,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.948
Ledda here is 100% right.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.584
Now is not the time to back off.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.955
Now is the time to show people
how strong we really are.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.291
(crowd murmuring)

15:46.679 --> 15:50.150
(security alarm blaring)

15:50.150 --> 15:52.219
GUARD: Everybody on
the ground! Now! Now!

15:57.024 --> 15:58.491
Get him off.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.060
(handcuffs click)

16:02.395 --> 16:04.597
A real man fights
his own battles.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.611
BIG FOSTER:
So you're asking me to believe

16:18.611 --> 16:21.181
that this utter damnable madness
will save us?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.150
How do you think we thrived

16:23.150 --> 16:25.085
up on this rock
for all these years?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.287
Do you think that coal company
is the first threat we've seen?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.456
There were winters so harsh

16:29.456 --> 16:32.192
the trees were frozen dead and
cracked apart in the breeze.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.362
There were
infestations, famines.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.630
What you face now,
it's a child's game.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.333
You've forgotten the cyfraiths,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.535
the creideamhs, the old laws.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.573
You Farrells, you're the
Losties, not them below.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.308
I never believed her.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.343
-My mother.
-Why would you?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.712
-She was a woman.
-No, but she was right.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.481
-MOREGON: About?
-About you.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.185
Prophecy of a demon among us.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.253
I'm looking at her right now.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.756
And all she wants is power.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.592
No. Not in the least.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.294
Tomorrow, when all this is done,

17:07.294 --> 17:09.562
and the goodness of the mountain
has been restored,

17:09.562 --> 17:11.198
we Kinnah will be gone.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.601
And your people, truly,
know this, Foster:

17:14.601 --> 17:18.438
they will thank you
for what you've done.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.407
Because in dying,

17:20.407 --> 17:22.775
you'll finally become the man
you've always wanted to be.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.444
G'Winveer,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.779
-she will never do it.
-Because she's your wife.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.181
She poisoned you.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.816
Just like your mother did.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.351
No.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.820
She's one of us now,
a believer.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.489
She just needed
a bit of persuading.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.125
I don't believe it.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.492
She will perform her part
in the rite

17:39.492 --> 17:40.727
because she loves her people.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.863
And also because, in her heart,

17:43.863 --> 17:46.333
she wants to see you dead.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.844
-So you drove from Oregon?
-Santa Cruz.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.546
One shot,
didn't even stop to eat.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.481
(chuckles)
As you can no doubt tell.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.316
(laughs) Not a lot of

18:03.316 --> 18:06.486
-vegan options on the
interstate, I'm guessing. -No.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
So thank you very much
for feeding me.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.323
You know, people around here
seem really generous.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.792
-So you were born in Blackburg
you said? -Mm-hmm.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.394
How lucky of you.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.463
You're not serious.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.231
Look, I've lived in a lot
of places in my life,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.432
and this really is...

18:19.432 --> 18:20.800
I was gonna say God's country,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.902
but I'm not really religious.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.272
You okay with that?

18:25.272 --> 18:28.708
Yeah. We're not as narrow-minded
as people might think.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.911
-We crazy Christians.
-Same with us atheists.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.381
Although, I'm not really sure
about that label, you know?

18:34.381 --> 18:36.216
I'm a spiritual guy.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.719
I don't know, maybe I'm just...
God-curious.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.522
-You know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.491
So, how'd you get into
all this, anyway?

18:44.491 --> 18:48.328
Well, I was gonna be
a tech whiz,

18:48.328 --> 18:50.197
startup billionaire, you know.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.831
I went to Stanford
when I was 16,

18:51.831 --> 18:54.301
then straight to Google.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.204
Then one day, I read about
how they were gonna destroy

18:57.204 --> 18:59.372
Creek River in Oregon
to put up a dam.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.874
-Mm-hmm.
-Something about it.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.545
I went up there for a protest
and... never came back.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.814
So I quit my job,
bought the camper,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
and now I drive
around the country

19:09.649 --> 19:12.719
-milching food off people
I barely even met. -Have at it.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.388
My girls don't like
raw vegetables, anyway.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.624
-Few sane people do.
-(chuckles)

19:17.624 --> 19:20.627
-So what about you? How'd you
get into this? -You know,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.696
I never really had anything
against coal mining,

19:23.696 --> 19:25.365
'cause those are the only jobs.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.599
But then when they said

19:26.599 --> 19:28.901
they were gonna blow up
Shay Mountain,

19:28.901 --> 19:30.737
I just couldn't watch
that happen.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.841
I mean, this mountain
is a part of me.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.444
I've seen it every day
of my life.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.812
Like, literally, I mean that.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.849
So folks around here are
pro-coal because they need jobs.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.751
-They do, but...
-So everybody must think

19:44.751 --> 19:47.754
-that you're on
the wrong side, huh? -Yes.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.490
You know, where I'm from,
everybody thinks I'm a hero.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.858
But you,

19:51.858 --> 19:53.726
I mean, you're the really
brave one here.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.364
I mean, you're really a hero.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.732
I mean that.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.570
You know, the thing is,
when I was a little girl,

20:03.570 --> 20:07.274
I was taught to be seen
and not heard.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.243
You got to go along to get
along, my mom used to say.

20:10.243 --> 20:14.614
So when I started this thing,
it felt... wrong.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.682
Really wrong.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.652
And then I realized
that I liked feeling wrong.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.590
Like, it felt right to be wrong.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.825
Do you know what I mean?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.960
Can I ask you
a serious question?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.396
Sure.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.531
Do I smell?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.366
(both laughing)

20:33.366 --> 20:34.667
Are you actually asking me?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.703
-Because...
-No, because I know I do.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.538
I mean, my camper's
got a solar bag,

20:38.538 --> 20:41.774
-but that thing's been empty
for a long time. -(laughs)

20:41.774 --> 20:44.744
Uh, there's a shower upstairs if
that's what you're getting at.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.947
Well, I think Mother Earth
will thank you personally.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.882
-Let me get you a towel.
-Thank you.

20:51.518 --> 20:55.021
Oh. Um... Sorry. Hey.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.560
Do you want to join me?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.565
Or would that be wrong?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.704
DR. MEHTA: I was hoping
you took my advice

21:11.704 --> 21:14.040
to keep your head down.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.943
Hmm. Tried to.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.480
But it gave the shorter ones
an easier target.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.750
You have to find a way
to keep them away.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.352
The guards saw them attack you.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.654
That's the only reason
you're not in Ad Seg.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.489
But you should be,
and I can recommend it,

21:29.489 --> 21:30.957
say that you're a danger
to the other inmates.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.825
No. I ain't doing that.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.061
It's the only place we can
guarantee your safety.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.763
You know, if I only know
one thing, Doc,

21:36.763 --> 21:38.498
it's that you got to be
real careful

21:38.498 --> 21:40.867
about what you give away
just to feel safe.

21:40.867 --> 21:44.471
I spent every day of my life
with the sun on my face,

21:44.471 --> 21:47.106
but when I was down there,
I couldn't even see the sky.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.708
I ain't going back there.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.710
I need to see daylight.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.081
DR. MEHTA:
That's beautiful.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.518
-Is that your home?
-No. I don't know where that is.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.854
My home is too beautiful
to put down on paper.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.957
-(chuckles): So is mine.
-Where are you from?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.059
-India.
-Why'd y'all leave?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.961
Oh, they wanted a better life.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.430
They find it?

22:12.632 --> 22:15.001
Where I come from,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.970
they put you in a cage
to help you think about

22:17.970 --> 22:20.607
what it is you did that might
have hurt somebody.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.910
This place... I don't know
what this is.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.552
Hmm.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.153
Oh.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.822
Thank you.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.790
(sighs)

22:47.166 --> 22:49.135
*

23:09.088 --> 23:11.057
*

23:27.006 --> 23:29.609
(Ledda laughing nearby)

23:32.845 --> 23:34.781
-(Ledda and Gordon laughing)
-(water running)

23:45.625 --> 23:47.159
Don't lose your shit.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.662
I ain't gonna lose my shit.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.664
I ain't gonna lose
no fight, either.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.033
You got to.
That's how club fighting works.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.903
You lose the first one, then
we got an in with these guys.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.471
It don't seem right.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.772
Zac said there's a line of guys

23:59.772 --> 24:01.073
who want to kick
some Farrell ass.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.175
And we got to let them
think they can.

24:03.175 --> 24:07.046
Just play-act like the guy's
whupping you, then go down.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.915
You want to make
some money or not?

24:08.915 --> 24:10.216
What do you think?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.184
All right.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.659
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

24:35.508 --> 24:37.476
Oh, no!

24:45.518 --> 24:47.820
-Get up!
-(cheering, clamoring continues)

24:49.288 --> 24:51.658
(crowd cheers)

24:57.029 --> 24:58.164
Come on!

25:04.704 --> 25:06.739
(crowd booing, clamoring)

25:19.085 --> 25:22.889
LADY RAY:
G'Winveer, my girl.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.659
I missed you something awful.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.794
Lady Ray.

25:29.796 --> 25:34.701
I always knew you were the one
to lead this clan, child.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.803
And look at you now.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.805
It's not all I hoped
it would be, ma'am.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.306
Never is.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.108
Sure wasn't for me.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.143
I failed them.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.311
And you.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.880
Nonsense. You just begun.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.217
All this, twill be ending
one day soon.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.085
How?

25:53.085 --> 25:55.187
They've killed
three of us already.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.790
And I cannot let that
keep happening.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.861
One more person dies,
and then it's done with

26:01.861 --> 26:04.130
-and they go.
-But he's your son.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.733
-I know that.
-And he's my husband.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.134
And you wanted him dead.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.169
I did.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.738
And then I didn't. I...

26:11.738 --> 26:13.272
Kill him now.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.842
And then it's over.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.713
So you believe them?

26:20.713 --> 26:23.983
Doing this will save us?

26:23.983 --> 26:27.987
This-this sacrifice, it...
it was once our way?

26:34.326 --> 26:38.030
You severely screwed the pooch
on that one, didn't you?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.299
I don't even know
what that means.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.134
I told you to lose.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.770
Shit. I even bet money
on your ass to lose.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.838
You peckerhead.
You just cost me 200 bucks.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.974
I'm sorry, Butch.
Just-- I don't know.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.877
Something about him,
something bothered me.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.845
MAN:
What up, Butch?

26:54.681 --> 26:56.649
Now...

26:56.649 --> 26:59.051
I heard these Farrells
are pretty damn tough.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.720
You think I'm an idiot.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.021
I see your game here.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.190
He just didn't play along,
did he?

27:04.190 --> 27:05.858
Butch.

27:07.927 --> 27:12.164
I am gonna let this slide
this one time.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.133
-Okay?
-Yeah.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.903
Now, you think your boy's
ready for the real thing?

27:16.903 --> 27:19.038
Yeah. Sure, Zacman.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.639
Well, good.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.377
You see that guy Edgar with
the ponytail down there?

27:25.377 --> 27:29.081
He just paid me three bills
to fight your Farrell.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.218
He says he don't much like
freakazoids.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.452
You game?

27:33.452 --> 27:35.187
-Hmm?
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.156
Just let me
talk to my boy, okay?

27:37.156 --> 27:38.190
All right.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.358
(sniffs) End of the card, then.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.060
I'll be lining up the bets.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.098
Make it happen, Butch.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.734
'Cause it's gonna be big.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.435
Most def.

27:49.435 --> 27:53.706
Don't you be telling me that
I got to lose this one, too.

27:53.706 --> 27:56.442
There's more money to be made
winning, Butch.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.878
-You ought to know that.
-Duh.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.880
-But he's three times
your size. -Now, come on.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.949
Ain't you ever heard
big men fall hard?

28:02.949 --> 28:04.183
Ain't happening, bro.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.484
Look, we're in this together.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.054
If you go in there
and get your neck broke

28:08.054 --> 28:11.023
by that guy, then my business
model's fracked, all right?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.324
I'll come up around him so fast

28:12.324 --> 28:13.893
he ain't gonna know
which way is up.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.962
-I beat you, didn't I?
-(scoffs) Funny.

28:15.962 --> 28:19.899
All I'm saying is, as your
partner and de facto manager,

28:19.899 --> 28:22.301
I do not recommend this
as your first real fight.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.103
Should you choose to do it,

28:24.103 --> 28:26.873
-I may have to bet against you.
-Let me tell you something,

28:26.873 --> 28:28.474
my first real fight happened
the day I was born.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.178
I'm gonna win this.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.852
(crowd cheering)

28:41.520 --> 28:42.822
(whooping)

28:44.957 --> 28:47.059
Hey. Not bad for a rookie.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.795
Look, I got guys all the way
from Barbourville

28:48.795 --> 28:50.296
that would love a shot
at that kid.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.064
(cheering)

28:52.064 --> 28:53.933
Well, let me check his schedule.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.434
Whatever it takes, man.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.969
I'll make it happen.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.170
-Who owes me?
-Come on!

29:02.208 --> 29:05.044
Sorry again if you bet
on the bigger horse, Butch.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.246
I ain't no fool, Hasil. I was
just trying to motivate you.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.248
-How's that eye?
-You're so full of shit.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.783
You didn't think
I could beat him.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.051
Yeah, whatever, dude.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.319
Hold out your hand.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.923
Come on, now.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.893
Hasil Farrell,
you're a rich man.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.862
(chuckles)

29:27.466 --> 29:29.435
(basketball bouncing)

29:31.938 --> 29:35.041
JAGER:
Mr. Farrell.

29:35.041 --> 29:39.311
You said you respect a man
who fights his own fights.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.847
I agree.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.317
Hey, I'm talking to you, animal.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.590
Listen, I ain't afraid of you.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.526
-None of you.
-Never said you were.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.528
You're afraid of yourself.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.030
Afraid of what you really are.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.565
You don't know nothing about me.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.067
(chuckles)
You're right about that.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.102
I thought you were a pure being,

30:03.102 --> 30:05.471
but you're nothing of the kind.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.840
So...

30:07.840 --> 30:09.575
my offer of brotherhood...

30:09.575 --> 30:12.044
is rescinded.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.345
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

30:22.254 --> 30:23.289
(groans loudly)

30:31.931 --> 30:32.899
Yeah! Kill him!

30:38.404 --> 30:40.406
You couldn't do it.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.875
(laughs)

30:42.875 --> 30:43.609
(grunts)

30:46.045 --> 30:48.014
-(security alarm blaring)
-GUARD: On the ground!

30:48.014 --> 30:49.348
-You, don't move!
-Get down! Now!

30:49.348 --> 30:51.383
Faces down!

30:52.351 --> 30:55.054
(handcuffs clicking)

30:55.054 --> 30:57.023
(panting)

31:07.299 --> 31:09.936
-Hey.
-Oh. Hey, Wade.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.905
There's a plate in the fridge
ready to microwave.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.673
Oh. Okay.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.142
(typing)

31:16.142 --> 31:17.910
Girls had dance class,

31:17.910 --> 31:20.479
so I figured I would just
feed them before they went.

31:20.479 --> 31:24.550
And, uh, Caleb's over next door
if you want to call him.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.053
Okay.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.989
Uh... Hey, um...

31:29.989 --> 31:31.991
I come home to have lunch
yesterday.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.593
I think I heard you
in the shower.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.129
Thought I heard someone
in there with you.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.597
What if the girls had
a come home instead of me?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.032
They're at school.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.367
-You know that.
-Is this a joke?

31:41.367 --> 31:43.035
-Who is he?
-It's none of your business.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.270
What's the matter with you?
Your husband just died.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.338
Spare me
your moral outrage, Wade.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.174
-You've got no place to talk.
-I got no place to talk?

31:48.174 --> 31:49.541
I think there's something
the matter with you.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.410
-What? -First this group
of yours, now this.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.612
Really? I'm sick and that's how
you're gonna talk to me?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.514
Yeah. You want to hear talking?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.383
-I ain't even started talking.
-You know what, Wade?

31:57.383 --> 31:59.185
-No. -I think maybe you're
the one with the real...

31:59.185 --> 32:00.719
(window shatters)

32:00.719 --> 32:03.155
-Oh, shit!
-Shit!

32:05.157 --> 32:07.126
(tires screeching)

32:10.729 --> 32:12.331
(panting)

32:12.331 --> 32:14.366
See what you're
bringing down on us?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.168
-This is your fault.
-Why?

32:16.168 --> 32:18.570
-What are you saying, Wade?
-Do me a favor. You want to look

32:18.570 --> 32:20.539
for that cat of yours,
go look in the trash.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.308
-'Cause that's where it is.
-What are you talking about?

32:22.308 --> 32:24.410
I found it dead
in the mailbox yesterday.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.412
Wrapped in one of those flyers
you're so proud of.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.180
-Why didn't you tell me that?
-What's next, Ledda?

32:28.180 --> 32:29.982
What's it gonna be?
Someone shooting up the house?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.483
We got a dead cat;
you want dead girls?

32:31.483 --> 32:32.684
'Cause that's what
it's gonna be.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.120
You need to quit
that group of yours.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.354
Yeah. I'm not gonna
do that, Wade.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.256
That is never
gonna happen, okay?

32:37.256 --> 32:39.058
Well, then I'm gonna take
your girls away from you

32:39.058 --> 32:41.060
-before one of them can get
hurt. -Okay, that is insane.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.261
You think I'm not
being serious?!

32:42.261 --> 32:44.030
-Yeah.
-You're not right!

32:44.030 --> 32:45.764
-You're not right in the head,
Ledda! -I'm not right?

32:45.764 --> 32:49.368
I'm not right in the head?
God, I can't believe you, Wade.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.337
You know what?
I'll be gone soon enough.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.706
And then you can have my girls
for good, how's that?

32:55.774 --> 32:57.509
Finished?

32:57.509 --> 32:59.478
'Cause I'm gonna go in there
and pack a bag

32:59.478 --> 33:01.447
for Caleb and the girls,
'cause we can't stay here.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.451
SALLY-ANN:
Close your eyes.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.685
Come on. Close 'em.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.120
(chuckles) All right.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.488
Okay. Are they closed?

33:09.488 --> 33:10.722
-Yeah.
-(laughs): Okay.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.630
-Okay, open them.
-Yeah.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.299
Open them now.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.371
That's, uh...

33:25.371 --> 33:26.705
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.741
Uh, you have to carry me
over the threshold.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.078
-Huh?
-You have to pick me up

33:32.078 --> 33:33.779
and carry me in.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.115
I know it's stupid,
but I saw it on, like,

33:36.115 --> 33:38.217
-Million Dollar Listing
on TV, so just... -Okay.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.119
-Just do it. -Don't know
what that is, but...

33:40.119 --> 33:41.753
-(both laugh)
-(Hasil grunts)

33:41.753 --> 33:43.222
(both sigh)

33:43.222 --> 33:44.823
-You want to grab that for me?
-I will.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.359
(laughs)

33:47.359 --> 33:48.794
(door closes)

33:48.794 --> 33:51.263
(sighs)

33:51.263 --> 33:54.333
-It's big. It's big.
-Mm-hmm.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.469
It's so...
It's so big I lost you.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.837
-I can't even see you anymore.
-(laughing)

33:58.837 --> 34:00.839
Can't find you.
Where'd you go?

34:00.839 --> 34:02.374
Come on, now.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.610
I'm over here. (laughs)

34:04.610 --> 34:06.078
I know.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.683
So you gonna tell me
how you got this black eye?

34:11.683 --> 34:13.552
Or do I have to guess?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.487
I fight.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.791
I fight people.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.295
Thought so.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.866
You be safe.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.835
You're all I have now, Hasil.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.671
Same here.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.375
This is it.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.210
You and me.

34:41.247 --> 34:44.150
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.

34:49.621 --> 34:53.325
Babe, so, um...

34:53.325 --> 34:57.896
I was thinking table
and, like, three chairs.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.332
A rug to cover up these stains.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.833
A couple of lamps.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.369
Shelves.

35:03.369 --> 35:06.272
-Sure.
-(both laugh)

35:06.272 --> 35:10.609
What, uh, about the bed?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.644
Uh... I was thinking maybe here.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.513
-Right there?
-Yeah.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.515
That is the only other place
for it to go.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.317
(laughs)
Okay. All right, all right.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.685
That's good. Here's good.

35:19.685 --> 35:23.922
-I like here.
-Me, too.

35:23.922 --> 35:27.226
Here it is, then. Come here.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.495
(Sally-Ann laughs,
Hasil growls)

35:34.633 --> 35:36.568
(both chuckle softly)

35:38.604 --> 35:40.572
Sheriff.
Ballistics report came back

35:40.572 --> 35:42.474
on that weapon
from the Chimney Road house.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.277
You were right. That Farrell
didn't kill your brother-in-law.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.579
So I guess we still got
to find the guy now.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.815
Wonder how we're gonna do that.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.617
Hey, come on in, Sheriff.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.352
I want you out
of my station house right now.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.821
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-You railroaded that kid

35:55.821 --> 35:58.557
on that murder charge. I told
you he was innocent and he was.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.259
-You can pack up all your stuff
right now. -Hold on, Wade.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.328
-Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.
-Hey, don't "yo" me, asshole.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.629
I found a gun out at the site
of that triple homicide

36:03.629 --> 36:05.264
out on Chimney Road.

36:05.264 --> 36:08.500
Ballistics match the gun
that killed Breece Dobbs.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.802
Fingerprints came back,
Foster Farrell's not a match.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.504
I want you to clear
all your stuff.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.440
Get out of here. I'm calling the
state's attorney about you.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.741
And then I'm gonna get a lawyer
to get him out of there.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.276
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.444
You know who I was just
on the phone with?

36:18.444 --> 36:20.312
Marsil.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.314
Foster Farrell killed an inmate.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.649
Broke his neck.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.683
What?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.752
No. I don't believe you.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.454
Why not?

36:28.454 --> 36:30.822
Is it because you had a hunch
that he was a good man?

36:30.822 --> 36:33.425
Well, guess what.
He's not a good man.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.361
Not at all.

36:35.361 --> 36:38.264
Nice police work, though.
Well done.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.860
(TV playing indistinctly)

37:08.860 --> 37:10.829
(coughs)

37:14.366 --> 37:16.335
(sighs)

37:26.978 --> 37:28.947
(sighing)

37:45.531 --> 37:47.499
(sighs)

37:54.072 --> 37:56.041
(sighs)

37:59.044 --> 38:00.646
Hey, Ledda.

38:00.646 --> 38:04.049
Can I talk to you for a moment?

38:06.985 --> 38:09.455
What?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.490
I'm sorry.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.992
I'm sorry for what
I said before.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.461
I didn't mean it.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.796
Okay.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.798
You know, uh...

38:19.798 --> 38:22.934
Uh, you say, you know,

38:22.934 --> 38:25.103
you say everything happened
for a reason.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.373
Yeah.

38:27.373 --> 38:31.009
I think ev-everything
happened for a reason.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.645
Um, wh-what are you
talking about?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.514
It's not your fault; it's mine.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.450
I don't understand.
What, what is?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.885
All this. I mean...

38:41.653 --> 38:44.122
All of this is my fault.

38:44.122 --> 38:47.526
I didn't do something
when I should have.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.662
Now, I-I know what I have to do,

38:50.662 --> 38:52.931
but it's not necessarily legal.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.766
-Wade...
-It's all right.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.867
I can handle it.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.838
Yeah, I'm gonna take care of it.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.442
I'm gonna go say good night
to the kids.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.610
(grunts)

39:08.780 --> 39:10.749
*

39:16.121 --> 39:18.089
Hasil?

39:25.431 --> 39:27.399
(sighs)

39:48.720 --> 39:51.189
(door opens)

39:51.189 --> 39:53.158
(door closes)

39:57.563 --> 39:58.764
It's time.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.965
Are you ready?

39:59.965 --> 40:02.534
Make it fast.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.135
Bury him before sunup.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.572
His grave's already dug.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.140
Next to his mother's.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.615
(indistinct chatter)

40:18.183 --> 40:20.986
(speaking stops)

40:20.986 --> 40:22.954
*

40:52.183 --> 40:55.020
*

41:04.162 --> 41:08.934
Farrells.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.637
These times are never to be seen
by us again.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.639
Tonight one of us must die

41:13.639 --> 41:15.774
so that all of us may live.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.951
But tomorrow I promise you,
our home will be ours

41:25.951 --> 41:28.787
and ours alone once more.

41:57.549 --> 42:00.752
Cosain fuil ond fuil.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.222
Only blood can save blood.

42:09.828 --> 42:13.799
MOREGON:
What is it?

42:13.799 --> 42:15.233
He is not the strongest of us.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.647
(all gasping and clamoring)

42:28.647 --> 42:31.149
BIG FOSTER:
G'Winveer...

42:31.149 --> 42:32.684
G'Win.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.786
-(G'Win strains)
-Why could you not see

42:34.786 --> 42:36.655
the gift I gave to you?

42:36.655 --> 42:39.257
(grunts softly)

42:42.227 --> 42:43.729
(groans softly)

42:45.797 --> 42:47.065
G'WIN:
Moregon, wait.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.903
Take this.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.179
(Moregon groans, all gasp)

43:04.716 --> 43:06.351
(screams)

43:06.351 --> 43:08.253
BIG FOSTER:
Cut me loose!

43:09.721 --> 43:11.790
Cut me loose!

43:11.790 --> 43:14.726
(grunts, yells)

43:16.662 --> 43:18.196
My queen.

43:21.667 --> 43:24.369
(quietly):
G'Winveer, my queen. My queen.
