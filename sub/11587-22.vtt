03:10.424 --> 03:12.860
JOGGER FOUND HER
IN THAT ROWBOAT.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.964
DO PEOPLE ROW
AROUND GRACIE MANSION?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.400
- NOPE.
NO RENTALS AROUND HERE.

03:19.433 --> 03:23.337
- SO WE HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING WHO SHE IS

03:23.371 --> 03:26.374
OR WHERE SHE FLOATED IN FROM.

HOVERING OVER HER BODY.

THEY RAN
WHEN SHE APPROACHED.

- SO IF OUR VIC DID HAVE
A WALLET, THERE IT WENT.

04:32.406 --> 04:35.309
- THEY WERE JUST GOING
THROUGH THAT WOMAN'S POCKETS.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.744
I DON'T THINK THOSE BOYS
WOULD'VE ATTACKED HER.

NO DRAG MARKS.

DUMPED IN THIS ROWBOAT,
AND WASHED UP HERE.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.331
- OKAY, SO WHY DID YOU
COME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE?

04:57.365 --> 05:01.034
I MEAN, JOGGERS DON'T
USUALLY COME OVER THIS FAR.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.503

05:02.536 --> 05:04.938
- AND YOU'RE
ABOUT TO LIE TO US.

- HE'S NOT A DEALER.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.098
IT'S HIS OWN SCRIP.
- OH.

HIS NAME, IS ROUGH,

- YOU GOT JASPAR
ON SPEED DIAL?

- MM-HMM. I BET HE'S
A REAL GOOD STUDENT TOO.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.078
DASH AND I HAVE
A BABY YOGA CLASS.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.980
- NOT TODAY,
YOU DON'T.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.717
- SO NO WAY TO I.D. HER?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.719
- WELL, THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED,
SHE COULD BE A WORKING GIRL.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.821
- NICK, YOU GOTTA
GET OUT MORE.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.623
EVERYONE DRESSES
LIKE THAT NOW.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.757
- OLIVIA,
GO TO THE HOSPITAL

05:56.790 --> 05:58.392
IN CASE SHE REGAINS
CONSCIOUSNESS.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.561
- I'LL CHECK DATABASES,
MISSING PERSONS.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.396
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE
SHE DIDN'T COME HOME TO.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.831
- AND I'LL INFORM 1PP

06:03.864 --> 06:05.666
THAT THE INVESTIGATION
IS PROCEEDING.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.868
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS--

06:07.901 --> 06:11.104
WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE,
AND WHY?

06:15.443 --> 06:17.044
- OUR JANE DOE'S PRINTS
AREN'T IN THE SYSTEM,

06:17.077 --> 06:18.646
AND NO ONE MATCHING
HER DESCRIPTION

06:18.679 --> 06:20.748
HAS BEEN REPORTED MISSING
IN THE LAST 48 HOURS.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.850
- OKAY, WELL,
WARNER SAYS,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.686
WITH THE VAGINAL ABRASIONS
AND THE BITE MARKS,

06:25.719 --> 06:27.087
THAT IT'S LIKELY
SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.022
SHE'S COLLECTING
DNA SAMPLES NOW.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.625
- WARNER?
SHE GOT HERE FAST.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.762
- HALF-NAKED WOMAN WASHES UP
IN THE MAYOR'S BACKYARD,

06:34.795 --> 06:36.196
EVERYBODY JUMPS.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.631
HOW'S SHE DOING?
- NOT GOOD.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.166
SHE'S IN A COMA.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.170
INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE FROM
HER HEAD WOUND IS INCREASING.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.037
- ANYTHING ON THE WEAPON?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.606
- SHE WAS HIT
WITH A WOODEN OBJECT.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.075
IT LEFT SPLINTERS,
HAD A THIN EDGE.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.643
WHATEVER IT WAS,
IT DID THE JOB.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.945
NO SIGNS
OF CHRONIC DRUG USE,

06:51.979 --> 06:54.515
BUT SHE DID HAVE ALCOHOL
AND MDMA IN HER SYSTEM.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.116
- ECSTASY?

06:56.149 --> 06:57.818
SO SHE WAS PARTYING.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.920
- OR SHE WAS DRUGGED.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.722
- SOMETHING ELSE INTERESTING--

07:01.755 --> 07:03.591
A PELVIC X-RAY
SHOWED SHE HAD

07:03.624 --> 07:05.826
STAINLESS STEEL STITCHING
FROM AN OLD HERNIA,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.828
UNCOMMON IN THIS COUNTRY.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.062
- MORE THIRD WORLD?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.564
- THE DENTISTRY
IS FIRST WORLD.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.733
I'LL PUT OUT A QUERY.
SOMEONE WILL KNOW.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.134
- IF SHE'S A FOREIGN NATIONAL
WHO CAME

07:14.167 --> 07:16.136
INTO THE COUNTRY
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.572
HER PRINTS COULD BE
IN I.C.E.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.575
- WELL, THANKS, MELINDA.
AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.944
- UH, ONE MORE THING.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.713
SHE'S HAD
AT LEAST TWO CHILDREN.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.116
IF YOU CAN,
FIND HER NEXT OF KIN SOON.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.618
THIS KIND OF HEAD TRAUMA,

07:30.651 --> 07:33.153
WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT A HOMICIDE.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.856
- SHE'S NOT FROM THE U.S.?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.225
I.C.E. HAVE ANY HITS
ON HER PRINTS?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.060
- NOT YET.
LOOK, THEY'RE JAMMED UP.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.930
A LOT OF GOVERNORS
CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGALS.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.865
SO NO "WHO."
WHAT ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERE,

07:44.898 --> 07:45.999
THE ROWBOAT?
- DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.167
IT'S A GENERIC BOAT.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.269
THERE'S NO SERIAL NUMBERS,
NO NAME.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.205
- HARBOR AND AVIATION KNOW
WHERE SHE FLOATED IN FROM?

07:52.239 --> 07:54.842
- NO, THEY SAID IF WE KNOW WHEN,
THEY CAN TELL US WHERE.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.744
AND IF WE KNOW WHERE,
THEY CAN TELL US WHEN.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.012
- THAT'S NOT AS HELPFUL
AS I'D LIKE.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.280
- IT'D BE MORE HELPFUL
IF SHE WERE DEAD.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.049
- MELINDA, REALLY?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.017
- RIGOR, A TIME OF DEATH,
WE COULD BACKTRACK.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.887
- OH, ACTUALLY I'M GLAD
WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.622
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.724
IT'S BEEN EIGHT HOURS,
WE GOT NOTHING.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.926
- YEAH, IT'S ALMOST 3:00.
SCHOOL'S ABOUT TO BE LET OUT.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.662
LET'S GO.
- HOLD ON, ROLLINS.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.863
HOW'S YOUR WING?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.731
MAYBE I SHOULD
SEND AMARO WITH FIN.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.132
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FINE.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.169
P.T.'S A BITCH,
BUT I'M GOOD TO GO.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.676
- ON THE BENCHES,

08:28.709 --> 08:31.712
YELLOW BASEBALL CAP
AND HOODIE.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.016
- HEY.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.786
UM, IS ONE OF Y'ALL
NAMED JASPAR?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.088
- WHO'S ASKING?

08:41.121 --> 08:44.124
- UH, ONE OF THE MOMS
FROM MY BABY YOGA CLASS

08:44.157 --> 08:46.660
SAID THAT YOU GUYS
WERE SOMETIMES HERE.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.061
- BABY YOGA, HUH?

08:48.095 --> 08:51.064
- YEAH, LIKE, I HAVE--
I HAVE A THREE-MONTH-OLD,

08:51.098 --> 08:54.234
AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE
STAYING AWAKE.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.269
I-I HAVE CASH.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.976
- NAME BRAND,
NOT THOSE GENERICS.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.111
- THAT'S GREAT,
THANK YOU.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.014
AND YOU'RE JASPAR BARRON?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
YOU GUYS,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.285
STAND UP. UP.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.655
YEP, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.689
HEY, HEY, HEY!

09:15.723 --> 09:17.190
FIN, WE GOT ONE RUNNING.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.828
YOU MOVE,
AND I'LL ADD RESISTING ARREST.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.029
- HEY, YOU, YOU!

09:22.062 --> 09:25.065
PUT YOUR HANDS UP,
GET DOWN.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.170
- SO THE SMART KIDS
ARE SELLING DRUGS

09:30.203 --> 09:31.605
TO MILFS THESE DAYS?

09:31.639 --> 09:34.174
- NOT DRUGS,
THEY'RE PRESCRIPTION.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.375
- IT'S A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.645
- IT'S JASPAR'S SCRIP,
NOT MINE.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.980
IT'S ALL HIS IDEA,
I SWEAR.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.682
- WE KNOW THE ADDERALL
IS YOURS.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.916
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO HAUL YOU
TO CENTRAL BOOKING.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.184
- COME ON, YOU SEEM
LIKE A GOOD KID.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.253
YOU'VE GOT NO PRIORS.
- THIS IS ALL ON TODD.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.855
I-I OWE HIM MONEY.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.190
- AH, SO TODD SAYS, "JUMP,"
YOU SAY, "HOW HIGH?"

09:50.223 --> 09:51.892
TODD TELL YOU
TO KNOCK THAT GIRL OUT

09:51.925 --> 09:53.360
IN THE ROWBOAT,
RAPE HER?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.629
- NO!
WE SAW HER FLOATING THERE.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.197
I SAID, "WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF HERE,"

09:57.230 --> 09:59.900
AND TODD WANTED
TO CHECK HER POCKETS.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.702
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
- COME ON.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.737
YOU BELIEVE JASPAR,
NOT ME?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.739
DO I LOOK LIKE
A DRUG DEALER?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.340
- WHAT ABOUT RAPIST?
- SERIOUSLY?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.842
SHE WAS OUT COLD
WHEN WE GOT THERE.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.978
- YOU WERE THE LAST ONES
TO BE WITH HER.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.179
AND SHE'S IN A COMA NOW.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.781
SHE DIES,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MURDER.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.183
AND WE WILL FIND YOUR DNA
ON HER BODY,

10:16.216 --> 10:17.851
YOU'LL BE TIED
TO THE RAPE.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.119
- I DIDN'T RAPE HER.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.287
I JUST WENT
THROUGH HER POCKETS.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.354
- YOU TAKE ANYTHING?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.356
- SOME LOOSE CHANGE,
A LIPSTICK.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.759
I GAVE IT TO MY MOTHER.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.294
- AND THAT'S ALL?
NO CREDIT CARDS?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.896
- SHE HAD ONE CARD,

10:28.929 --> 10:31.064
BUT IT WAS FOR A HOTEL
OR SOMETHING.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.432
- WHAT, LIKE A KEY CARD?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.669
- I GUESS.
- WHICH HOTEL?

10:38.271 --> 10:39.439
- SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO CHECK OUT TODAY.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.440
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.975
- SIR, JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.276
I'M ALSO GONNA NEED
THE PASSKEY.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.078
- NO, I-I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.313
IS IT OKAY IF WE--
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.248
- THIS A POLICE INVESTIGATION,
ALL RIGHT?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.683
YOUR GUEST WAS ASSAULTED.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.084
THE PASSKEY
TO THE SAFE, NOW.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.720
- OKAY, WE ALSO NEED
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE

10:52.753 --> 10:54.254
FROM THE HALLWAY,
FROM THE ELEVATOR,

10:54.287 --> 10:55.923
A RECORD
OF EVERY SINGLE CALL

10:55.956 --> 10:57.324
THAT WAS MADE TO
OR FROM THAT ROOM,

10:57.357 --> 10:59.159
WI-FI USE--
- O-OKAY.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.394
OKAY, LADY,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.266
- OH, MY GOD.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.002
- OUT.

11:09.036 --> 11:09.970
- PLACE IS A MESS.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.906
- OR SOMEBODY GOT HERE FIRST
AND TOSSED IT.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.242
- WHAT WERE THEY
LOOKING FOR?

11:15.275 --> 11:19.780
- NOT FISHNETS
OR LEATHER OR LACE.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.816
SOMEBODY WENT
ON A DOWNTOWN SHOPPING SPREE.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.853
- WELL, THEY WEREN'T

NO PHONE.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.884
- SO THEY WERE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

11:56.917 --> 11:59.787
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO SEE.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.289
- THERE'S NO CALLS
FROM THE HOTEL LANDLINE.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.157
THIS IS ALL
THE INTERNET ACTIVITY

12:04.191 --> 12:05.458
FROM ARIEL RANDOLPH'S ROOM?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.795
- GUESTS SIGN
AN ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.830
NOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING
ILLEGAL IN THERE--

12:09.863 --> 12:11.164

12:32.519 --> 12:34.221
OKAY, SHE'S GOT MP3s.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.557
THEY'RE ALL TAGGED
WITH PLACES AND DATES,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.459
LIKE IT'S LIVE MUSIC.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.494
- THIS MIGHT BE
WHO RANSACKED HER ROOM.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.296
THE TIME CODE HAS HIM
ENTERING FIVE HOURS

12:43.330 --> 12:46.266

12:48.335 --> 12:52.172
FOR SURVEILLANCE CAMS.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.907

THEY'RE EN ROUTE NOW.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.875
- OKAY, MARRIED MOTHER
OF TWO.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.177
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
ON HER OWN IN NEW YORK CITY?

14:04.211 --> 14:05.879
- SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND
SHE WAS HERE

14:05.913 --> 14:07.981
TO DO PODCASTS ON SOME--

14:08.015 --> 14:10.017
WHAT'D SHE CALL IT?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.020
- THE CARAVANSERAI
WORLD MUSIC FESTIVAL,

14:13.053 --> 14:14.287
AND SHE WASN'T LYING
ABOUT THAT.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.024
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT
DOZENS OF MP3s

14:17.057 --> 14:19.592
OF DIFFERENT BANDS,
I MEAN, MOST OF WHICH

14:19.626 --> 14:21.461
PLAYED DURING THE FESTIVAL
LAST WEEK.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.164
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
HER FAMILY HEARD FROM HER?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.532

14:25.565 --> 14:27.034
SHE KEPT IN TOUCH.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.202
THEY VIDEO CHATTED
TWICE A DAY.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.604
- ANY CHANCE SHE TOLD THEM
WHERE SHE WAS GOING THAT NIGHT?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.040
- NO, SHE SAID
SHE WAS GONNA PACK

14:33.073 --> 14:35.008
AND EDIT HER PODCAST.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.477
THE HUSBAND SEEMS TO HAVE
NO IDEA ABOUT HER NIGHTLIFE.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.380
AT HOME, SHE TEACHES PIANO,
RUNS THE P.T.A. CRAFT FAIR.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.315
- OKAY, BUT SHE WOULDN'T
BE THE FIRST SPOUSE

14:42.349 --> 14:44.584
TO KEEP A PART
OF HER LIFE SECRET.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.287
- DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.256
- SHE'S INTO SOMETHING MORE
THAN FIDDLES AND ACCORDIONS.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.258
- WELL, LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT OR WHO,

14:51.291 --> 14:54.027
AND LET'S START WITH
WHOEVER RANSACKED HER ROOM.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.563
- WELL, THE HOTEL MANAGER
SAID ARIEL

14:56.596 --> 14:59.066
TOOK OUT TWO KEYS
WHEN SHE CHECKED IN.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.667
IT COULD BE
SHE HAS A FRIEND HERE.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.402
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
ACCORDING TO HER PHONE RECORDS,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.671
ARIEL HAS MULTIPLE CALLS

15:04.704 --> 15:06.673
TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT
PHONE NUMBERS.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.075
- TRACK 'EM DOWN.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.542
FAMILY GETS HERE
IN SIX HOURS.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.079
I WANNA BE ABLE
TO GIVE 'EM SOME ANSWERS.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.648
- IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE
A LOOK AT THE PHOTO.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.450
- SO SHE CALLED YOU
SEVERAL TIMES

15:17.484 --> 15:18.952
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.188
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT?

15:21.221 --> 15:24.324
- ARIEL, SHE WAS IN TOWN
FOR THE FESTIVAL.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.293
I WAS EDITING HER PODCAST.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.560
IS SHE OKAY?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.429
- WELL, SHE WAS THE VICTIM
OF AN ASSAULT.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.398
- OH, NO, POOR GIRL.
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.233
- WELL, WE WERE HOPING
THAT YOU COULD TELL US.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.002
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.736
- I JUST MET HER
A WEEK AGO AT A GIG.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.006
- SO YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS PROFESSIONAL?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.473
- YEAH, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

15:40.507 --> 15:42.109
AND I DON'T THINK
ARIEL WAS IN NEW YORK

15:42.142 --> 15:44.477
TO HOOK UP
WITH A SOUND ENGINEER.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.446
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.115
- A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.716
SHE WAS ASKING ME

WERE HEADED
TO THE TOMORROWLAND FESTIVAL

15:52.685 --> 15:53.720

15:53.753 --> 15:55.322
ARIEL SAID SHE'D JOIN US.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.490
- DO YOU KNOW
WHERE ARIEL WAS TUESDAY NIGHT?

15:57.524 --> 15:59.192
- NO.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.994
THERE WERE A COUPLE DOZEN
PERFORMANCES IN TOWN--

16:01.028 --> 16:02.329
AFRICAN, CUBAN, BRAZILIAN.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.997
SHE COULD'VE BEEN
AT ANY ONE OF 'EM.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.732
- WHERE WERE YOU, PHIL?

16:05.765 --> 16:07.367

SHE WAS GOING TO,

16:15.775 --> 16:18.545
SHE COULD'VE MET ANYBODY
FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.347
I DON'T MEAN TO--

16:20.380 --> 16:23.250
SHE KIND OF SEEMED LIKE
A GROUPIE IN SEARCH OF A GROUP.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.322
[school bell rings]
- ARIEL RANDOLPH?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.424
UH, YES, SHE CALLED ME,
SEVERAL TIMES.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.327
ONE OF OUR PARENTS
GAVE HER MY NUMBER.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.762
I HANDLE ADMISSIONS HERE.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.264
SHE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.598
- WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.533
- WELL, SHE WANTED TO KNOW
IF P.S. 27

16:40.567 --> 16:42.335
WOULD BE A GOOD FIT
FOR HER TWO BOYS.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.604

ABOUT MOVING HERE?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.706

IN-SCHOOL SUPPORT FOR HER SON
WITH LEARNING ISSUES,

16:49.276 --> 16:50.710
CURRICULUM,
THAT KIND OF THING.

16:50.743 --> 16:51.644
WHY?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.115
- SHE'S IN A COMA
AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.450
- IS SHE THE ONE THEY FOUND
UP AT GRACIE MANSION?

16:57.484 --> 16:58.818
I SAW IT ON THE NEWS.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.088
I-I NEVER IMAGINED
THAT COULD BE HER.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.056
- YEAH, HOW WELL
DO YOU KNOW HER, MR. LANDRY?

17:03.090 --> 17:05.525
- UH, NOT VERY WELL.
WE'VE MET.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.094
SHE SEEMED SO SWEET--

17:07.127 --> 17:09.196
SOMEONE DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT--

17:09.229 --> 17:12.099
- YOU KNOW ANYONE ELSE SHE
WAS IN CONTACT WITH IN NEW YORK?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.666
- UH, NO, NOT AT ALL.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.468
SHE MENTIONED
WORKING IN MUSIC.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.836
- YOU KNOW, DID SHE SAY

17:16.869 --> 17:18.405
WHY SHE WAS
CONSIDERING MOVING?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.207
- UH, NO, NOT EXACTLY.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.542
BUT SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT HOW HER BOYS WOULD ADJUST.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.711
SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD
ABOUT HER HUSBAND.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.381
I FIGURED IT WAS BEST
NOT TO ASK.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.850
- THAT WAS ROLLINS.
WE'RE NOW 0 FOR 5.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.051
NO ONE ARIEL CALLED
WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CITY

17:32.085 --> 17:34.787
KNOWS WHERE SHE WENT OR WHO
SHE WAS WITH TUESDAY NIGHT.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.089

18:11.158 --> 18:13.860
FELL IN WITH A BAD CROWD.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.797

TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.499
THAT'S GONNA BE
A TOUGH CONVERSATION

18:19.532 --> 18:21.668
TO HAVE WITH THE HUSBAND.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.370
- I GOT IT.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.872
I'LL BE FINE.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.844
- MR. RANDOLPH.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.846

18:59.772 --> 19:01.708
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
ON THE PLANE.

19:01.741 --> 19:05.778

19:07.280 --> 19:09.516
- OKAY.

19:16.223 --> 19:20.593
- TAKE AS LONG
AS YOU NEED.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.694
- WHAT HAPPENED, DAD?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.230
- I DON'T KNOW, SON.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.432
BUT THE POLICE
WILL FIND OUT, RIGHT?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.867
- WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.875
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, MOM?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.711
- WAYNE, SHH.
YOU'LL WAKE HER UP.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.714
- SHE'S NOT SLEEPING.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.850
- IT'S OKAY, GRANT.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.885
YOU CAN TALK TO HER.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.757
- MOM, IT'S ME, GRANT.

20:09.376 --> 20:09.576
.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.343
- THEY'RE TELLING ME
THAT ARIEL HAS

20:10.943 --> 20:12.545
AN INTRACEREBRAL HEMATOMA,

20:12.579 --> 20:14.581
AND IT'S PUTTING PRESSURE
ON HER BRAIN STEM.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.449
THEY'VE ASKED ME TO SIGN
A D.N.R.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.419
I'VE DONE BROADCASTS
FROM STROKE WARDS.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.687
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.423
- LOOK, SHE'S GETTING
THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE,

20:23.456 --> 20:24.524
MR. RANDOLPH.

20:24.557 --> 20:29.562
- THE OTHER INJURIES
THAT THE DOCTOR REFERRED TO--

20:29.596 --> 20:31.764
MY WIFE WAS RAPED?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.033
- WE THINK SO, YES.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.636
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
OF ANYBODY

20:36.669 --> 20:39.672
SHE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN IN CONTACT WITH?

20:42.542 --> 20:45.778
- SO YOU DON'T THINK
THIS WAS A STRANGER?

20:45.812 --> 20:48.014
IT WAS SOMEONE
SHE MET HERE?

20:48.047 --> 20:50.550
- DID SHE TALK TO YOU
IN ANY DETAIL

20:50.583 --> 20:53.353
ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS
DOING HERE?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.622
- NO. I KNOW SHE WAS
GOING OUT TO CONCERTS.

20:55.655 --> 20:59.626
BUT WHEN WE TALKED,
IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT OUR BOYS.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.927
- AND WHEN SHE LEFT
FOR THIS TRIP,

21:00.960 --> 21:04.997
YOU TWO WERE
ON GOOD TERMS?

21:05.031 --> 21:08.635
- YES.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.571
- AND...SHE'S TAKEN
OTHER TRIPS BY HERSELF?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.574
- NOT REALLY,
JUST TO VISIT FAMILY.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.745
THIS WAS HER FIRST "ADVENTURE,"
SHE CALLED IT.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.615
- AND YOU WERE OKAY
WITH THAT?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.552
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,
I WASN'T THRILLED,

21:25.585 --> 21:28.421
BUT THE BOYS
ARE OLDER NOW.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.358
AND ARIEL HAD TO GIVE UP
A LOT OF HER DREAMS

21:31.391 --> 21:32.625
WHEN WE STARTED A FAMILY,

21:32.659 --> 21:36.729
SO THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO HER,
FOR HER CAREER.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.434
- SO WILL SHE BE OKAY?

21:41.468 --> 21:43.035
- I HOPE SO.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.471
- SHE'S TOUGH.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.872
WHEN WE GO SKIING,

21:45.905 --> 21:48.608
SHE ALWAYS TAKES US
DOWN THE BIG HILLS.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.543
DAD CAN'T ANYMORE.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.811
- HEY, GRANT, YOU HUNGRY?

21:51.844 --> 21:55.848
YOU WANNA COME
PICK OUT A SNACK?

21:55.882 --> 21:57.817
- SO, WAYNE,
WHAT DID YOUR MOM

21:57.850 --> 21:59.686
TELL YOU ABOUT
HER NEW YORK TRIP?

21:59.719 --> 22:01.521
- SHE SAID WE'D LIKE IT,

22:01.554 --> 22:03.623
AND THAT MAYBE
WE COULD GO SOMEDAY.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.757
- DID SHE EVER TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MAYBE

22:04.791 --> 22:06.626
GOING TO SCHOOL HERE?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.696
- YEAH, SHE SAID WANTED US
TO SEE THE WORLD

22:09.729 --> 22:11.798
MORE THAN SHE DID
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.133
SHE WANTED US TO MEET
OTHER KINDS OF PEOPLE.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.403
- DID SHE MENTION
MEETING ANYONE HERE?

22:16.436 --> 22:19.472
- NO.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.509
IS ALL THIS STUFF TRUE?

22:25.512 --> 22:28.915
- THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO SELL NEWSPAPERS.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.753
YOU KNOW WHO YOUR MOM IS.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.623
COME ON.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.126
MR. DESAPIO?

22:40.159 --> 22:42.462
- DETECTIVE,
I CAME TO SEE ARIEL.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.596
I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.097
IT'S HORRIBLE.
HOW'S SHE DOING?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.466
- PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.635
AMANDA, THIS IS ARIEL'S
SOUND EDITOR.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.438
- THESE ARIEL'S BOYS?
- YEAH.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.805
- SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.874
SHE'S A REALLY NICE PERSON.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.410
- YEAH, SHE'LL BE OKAY.
- OKAY, GOOD.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.945
UH, WHAT ROOM IS SHE IN?
I WANTED TO LEAVE--

22:58.978 --> 23:01.414
- ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW
IT'S FAMILY ONLY.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.049
- OH, OKAY.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.884
CAN YOU GET THESE TO HER
FOR ME?

23:04.917 --> 23:08.054
- SURE.
- THANKS.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.756
- LET'S GO, GUYS.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.592
- THESE CLOTHES,
SHE MUST'VE BOUGHT 'EM HERE.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.727
SHE DOESN'T DRESS LIKE THAT
IN EDMONTON.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.829
- SO YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THESE PHOTOS?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.598
- I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.032
- WELL, SHE POSTED
FROM DIFFERENT CLUBS

23:20.066 --> 23:22.602
AND CONCERTS,
WITH MUSICIANS.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.871
YOU WERE ALL RIGHT
WITH HER GOING OUT ALONE?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.774
- I HAVE TO TRUST HER.
- OKAY.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.809
BECAUSE WE ALSO
ACCESSED HER EMAIL ACCOUNT,

23:29.842 --> 23:31.611
AND THERE WERE
A COUPLE OF EXCHANGES

23:31.644 --> 23:33.646
WHERE YOU SEEMED UPSET,
ASKING WHERE SHE WAS GOING,

23:33.680 --> 23:34.847
WHO SHE WAS WITH.

23:34.881 --> 23:35.948
- AND I SUPPOSE
I SOUNDED LIKE

23:35.982 --> 23:38.551
A JEALOUS OLD MAN.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.120
- NO.
NO, I GET IT.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.957
- WELL, I AM AN OLDER MAN
WITH A YOUNGER WIFE,

23:44.991 --> 23:46.225
AND I KNOW THAT ARIEL

23:46.258 --> 23:50.229
WANTED TO HAVE FRIENDS
HER OWN AGE.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.965
AND I WAS AFRAID THAT

23:52.999 --> 23:56.035
IF I HELD ON TOO TIGHTLY,
I MIGHT LOSE HER.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.070
- I UNDERSTAND.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.740
BUT IF THERE'S ANYONE
YOU CAN THINK OF

24:00.773 --> 24:03.676
WHO YOUR WIFE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MEETING,

24:03.710 --> 24:06.045
WE NEED TO KNOW.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.781
- OKAY.
[deep breath]

24:08.815 --> 24:11.050
WELL, THERE WAS
ONE MUSICIAN

24:11.083 --> 24:13.720
THAT SHE REALLY LIKED,

24:13.753 --> 24:15.655
PLAYED GUITAR I THINK.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.691
OH, HERE. THAT--
THAT'S HIM, RIGHT THERE.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.193
I RECOGNIZE HIM
FROM HIS CD.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.663
- DO YOU HAVE A NAME?
- NO.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.598
BUT THIS GUY,
HE CAME TO EDMONTON LAST YEAR.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.899
SHE WENT TO HIS CONCERT.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.234
- DID YOU GO?

24:28.267 --> 24:31.470
- IT'S NOT FOR ME.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.608
[knock at door]

24:35.642 --> 24:36.943
- SANTIAGO MORALES?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.678
- IT IS LATE.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.680
COULD BE ASLEEP,
COULD BE WORKING.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.281
- HE'S A MUSICIAN.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.651
HE'S NOT SLEEPING
AND HE'S DAMN SURE NOT WORKING.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.552
[knocks]

24:45.585 --> 24:47.554
- SANTIAGO?

24:50.256 --> 24:51.558
- CAN I HELP YOU?

24:51.591 --> 24:53.125
- YEAH, NYPD.
CAN WE COME IN?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.561
- NOW'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.028
- YOU KNOW ARIEL RANDOLPH?

24:56.062 --> 24:57.597
- I'M BAD WITH NAMES.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.265
- HERE'S A PICTURE
OF YOU TWO TOGETHER.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.733
- SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
AT THE STATION,

25:00.767 --> 25:03.135
OR YOU CAN JUST
GO AHEAD AND LET US IN.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.137
- IF YOU'RE WORRYING
ABOUT THE SMELL OF WEED,

25:05.171 --> 25:08.675
WE'RE PAST THAT.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.242
- OKAY, SO ARIEL.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.679
TALK.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.214
- YEAH, SHE INTERVIEWED ME
FOR NPR OR SOMETHING.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.749
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE WAS FROM OUT OF TOWN.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.585
- YEAH, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

25:18.618 --> 25:21.153
- I'M NOT SURE.
SHE CAME TO ONE OF MY SHOWS.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.622
[knock at door]

25:22.655 --> 25:23.756
- YOU EXPECTING COMPANY?

25:23.790 --> 25:26.793
- NO, BUT HERE, LET ME--
- ALLOW ME.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.963
- YOU READY?

25:30.997 --> 25:34.233
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WERE PEOPLE HERE.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.103
- OH, THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.606
FIN...

25:39.639 --> 25:43.342
YOU REMEMBER
MR. LANDRY FROM P.S. 27.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.211
- SMALL WORLD.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.713
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

25:57.924 --> 25:58.124
.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.291
- THIS IS FROM F.O.D. LOUNGE
TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THE ATTACK.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.161
- IT WAS TAKEN
ON ARIEL'S iPAD,

26:02.194 --> 26:03.596
WHICH WE FOUND
IN SANTIAGO'S LOFT.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.164
HE CLAIMS
SHE LOANED IT TO HIM.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.999
- THE HUSBAND CONFIRMED
THE iPAD IS ARIEL'S.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.869
- ANY CHANCE HE KNEW WHAT
SHE WAS UP TO, GOT JEALOUS?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.338
- WELL, WE DIDN'T
SHOW HIM THESE PHOTOS.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.140
CAPTAIN,
HE'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.041
HE WAS IN CANADA
THE WHOLE TIME.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.643
HE'S BARELY HANGING ON.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.377
- UH-HUH.
SO, THE OTHER LADY

26:18.410 --> 26:20.379
WITH ARIEL ISN'T A LADY?

26:20.412 --> 26:21.714
- CHARLES LANDRY?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.650
NO, HE WORKS AT P.S. 27.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.085
MARRIED,
APPARENTLY STRAIGHT.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.621
JUST LIKES TO PARTY
IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.790
- SO DID ARIEL KNOW
THAT SHE WAS A HE?

26:30.823 --> 26:33.125
- WE'RE NOT SURE,
BUT CHARLEY'S DNA

26:33.159 --> 26:34.727
IS A MATCH
FOR THE SALIVA FOUND

26:34.761 --> 26:36.362
ON THE BACK
OF ARIEL'S NECK.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.730
- ALL RIGHT,
SO HE WAS WITH HER

26:37.764 --> 26:38.898
THE NIGHT
SHE WAS ATTACKED.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.299
FIND OUT WHO ELSE WAS.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.069
- YEAH, LOOK.
OKAY, I TOOK ARIEL'S iPAD.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.837
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
ON THE NEWS.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.405
I COULDN'T
LET THOSE PHOTOS GET OUT,

26:46.438 --> 26:48.140
FOR CHARLEY'S SAKE.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.009
HE'S MY COUSIN.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.377
HE'S GOT A WIFE
AND A DAUGHTER.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.345
- COUSINS?

26:53.379 --> 26:56.983
WHAT IS HE,
YOUR WING WOMAN?

26:57.016 --> 26:58.117
- NO.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.119
NOT THAT YOU'D GET THIS,

27:00.152 --> 27:01.087
BUT CHARLEY'S
STRAIGHT AS AN AXE.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.822
HE JUST LIKES FABRIC.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.390
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.058
- AND ARIEL WAS UP FOR THAT?

27:06.092 --> 27:08.160
- WELL, SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY
KNOW ABOUT CHARLEY.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.996
IF YOU TELL 'EM TOO SOON,
THEY FREAK.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.664
SHE JUST WANTED
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

27:11.698 --> 27:14.366
SHE SAID HER OLD MAN
WAS AN OLD MAN.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.902
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.103
- TUESDAY NIGHT.
I WAS PLAYING A GIG

27:17.136 --> 27:19.005
AT CLUB KISMET
IN ASTORIA.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.740
- THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.

27:20.773 --> 27:24.110
- WHOA.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.845
WE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.714
SHE LEFT BEFORE WE DID.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.448
- BUT YOU THREE
WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.017
WHY'D SHE LEAVE?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.852
- SHE PANICKED
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.087
SHE'S CANADIAN.
THEY'VE GOT THEIR LIMITS.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.224
- IS THERE ANY WAY TO PROVE
SHE LEFT WITHOUT YOU?

27:39.458 --> 27:41.794
- YOU COULD ASK GABRIELA.
- WHO?

27:41.828 --> 27:44.063
- WHEN ARIEL LEFT,
GABRIELA SUBBED IN FOR HER.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.065
CHARLEY AND I WENT BACK
TO HER PLACE.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.434
- AND YOU MET ANOTHER GIRL
WHO'S INTO THIS?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.269
- YEAH, MAN,
IT'S NEW YORK.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.906
- AND ALL OF THREE OF YOU
VOUCH FOR EACH OTHER?

27:53.940 --> 27:56.242
- YOU COULD CALL IT THAT,
YEAH.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.278
- THAT'S GREAT.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.380
- IF THE SCHOOL FINDS OUT
ABOUT THIS, I'M FIRED.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.783
IF MY WIFE FINDS OUT--

28:03.816 --> 28:05.051
- SO BE HONEST,
HELP YOURSELF.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.119
YOU DIDN'T MEET ARIEL
AT THE SCHOOL.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.822
- NO, WE MET
AT THE F.O.D. LOUNGE.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.058
SHE THOUGHT WE WERE
KINDRED SPIRITS--

28:12.091 --> 28:13.860
WILD GIRLS
ON THE MUSIC SCENE.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.094
SHE CONFIDED IN ME,

28:15.127 --> 28:17.730
AND SHE DID ASK ME ABOUT
MOVING HER BOYS HERE.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.199
- SO HOW DID YOU GO
FROM TALKING CURRICULUM

28:20.232 --> 28:22.434
TO GETTING YOUR DNA
ALL OVER HER BODY?

28:22.468 --> 28:24.036
- SHE WAS HERE
FOR A GOOD TIME.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.504
WE HIT IT OFF,
WE HAD A FEW DRINKS,

28:25.537 --> 28:27.106
AND WE WENT DANCING.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.474
- SO WHO BROKE INTO
HER HOTEL ROOM,

28:28.507 --> 28:30.309
STOLE HER iPAD?

28:30.342 --> 28:31.310
- NOBODY BROKE IN.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.145
SHE GAVE ME HER EXTRA KEY.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.948
AFTER HE SAW THE NEWS,
SANTIAGO TOOK THE iPAD.

28:35.982 --> 28:37.349
HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.252
- OKAY, SO WAS IT YOU
OR WAS IT SANTIAGO

28:40.286 --> 28:43.422
THAT BASHED HER HEAD IN
AND RAPED HER?

28:43.455 --> 28:45.491
- WHAT?

28:47.827 --> 28:50.496
I SWEAR.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.199
OKAY, MAYBE WE
PUSHED HER TOO FAR

28:53.232 --> 28:54.300
OUTSIDE OF HER COMFORT ZONE

28:54.333 --> 28:56.168
WITHOUT PREPARING HER.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.236
I-I APOLOGIZED--

28:57.269 --> 29:01.040
- APOLOGIZED?
FOR WHAT?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.975
- WHEN SHE REALIZED
I WASN'T WHO I SAID I WAS,

29:03.009 --> 29:04.476
I-I THINK
SHE FELT BETRAYED.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.978
SHE JUST RAN OUT.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.513
- AND YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW HER?

29:07.546 --> 29:11.050
YOU JUST LET HER GO?

29:11.083 --> 29:15.087
- I CAN'T RUN IN HEELS.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.224
- OKAY, WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.293
- SO, SANTIAGO AND CHARLEY
ARE TELLING THE TRUTH?

29:21.327 --> 29:24.130
- SO FAR. I MEAN,
HERE'S ARIEL

29:24.163 --> 29:26.265
LEAVING CLUB KISMET
ON HER OWN.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.100
WE GOT SURVEILLANCE
FROM THE STREET.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.169
- THAT'S HER,
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.438
I MEAN, EASY PREY.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.973
- BUT WE DO.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.175
SHE'S IN ASTORIA
AT MIDNIGHT.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.977
CALL HARBOR AND AVIATION
BACK,

29:38.010 --> 29:39.178
SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT

29:39.211 --> 29:41.447
HOW SHE WASHES ASHORE
AT GRACIE MANSION.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.149
- WE DON'T NEED
TO USE THEM, CAPTAIN.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.417
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT
MY ROPE GUY, COLIN BENNETT.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.021
- SO YOUR ROPE GUY
IS TIDE GUY?

29:49.055 --> 29:51.858
- ROPES, TIDES,
PAINTS, SOLVENTS.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.126
C.S.U. CALLS ME
THEIR RENAISSANCE MAN.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.594
- OKAY, MICHELANGELO.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.030
IF SHE GOES IN THE WATER
IN ASTORIA,

29:58.064 --> 29:59.131
WHAT, SHE JUST FLOATS
ACROSS THE RIVER

29:59.165 --> 30:00.599
TO GRACIE MANSION?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.034
YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR TIDES AT ALL,

30:02.068 --> 30:04.303
DO YOU, CAPTAIN?
- APPARENTLY NOT.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.505
- YOU SEE, THIS AREA HERE,

30:06.538 --> 30:08.107
IT'S CALLED "HELL GATE"
FOR A REASON.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.977
IT'S A NARROW STRAIT
WHERE THE TIDES

30:11.010 --> 30:12.611
OF THE LONG ISLAND SOUND,
THE HARLEM RIVER,

30:12.644 --> 30:15.214
AND THE UPPER BAY ALL CONVERGE.
- OKAY, GO ON.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.516
- WELL, IF A BOAT
GOES INTO THE WATER HERE--

30:17.549 --> 30:19.151
SAY, THIS PARK
BY HELL GATE--

30:19.185 --> 30:21.153
- AND PEOPLE TIE UP ROWBOATS
IN THAT PARK.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.288
WE'VE BEEN CHECKING
TO SEE IF ANY

30:22.321 --> 30:23.956
HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.324
- IF SHE DID
GO IN THE WATER THERE

30:25.357 --> 30:28.194
BEFORE 3:00 A.M.,
THEN THE BOAT WOULD'VE

30:28.227 --> 30:30.429
TRAVELLED SOUTH,
PAST ROOSEVELT ISLAND.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.064
- WHOA, WHOA.
SOUTH?

30:32.098 --> 30:33.199
WHY DIDN'T SHE
END UP IN BROOKLYN?

30:33.232 --> 30:34.400
- I'M GETTING TO THAT.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.936
AT 4:30 A.M.
THAT MORNING,

30:36.969 --> 30:39.105
THE TIDE SHIFTED,
RUNNING NORTH.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.506
SHE COULD'VE EASILY REACHED

30:40.539 --> 30:42.208
THE EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN
BY 7:00 A.M.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.610
- OKAY, SO SAY
THAT WAS THE ROUTE.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.445
WHO DUMPED HER
IN THE ROWBOAT?

30:46.478 --> 30:47.880
- THAT, I'M AFRAID,
IS A MYSTERY

30:47.914 --> 30:49.248
BEYOND THE PULL
OF THE TIDES.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.517
- NOT BEYOND THE PULL
OF STREET CAMS.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.553
I JUST SENT YOU THE LINK.

30:57.289 --> 31:00.292
SHE WAS PICKED UP A FEW BLOCKS
FROM THE CLUB.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.032
- YEAH, THERE SHE IS.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.167
- AND WE'VE SEEN
THAT TRUCK BEFORE.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.270
- GO.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.205
- DID YOU FORGET
TO TELL US SOMETHING?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.240
- I CAN EXPLAIN.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.908
- WHY YOU LIED TO US?

31:15.942 --> 31:17.543
YOU SAID THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO ARIEL

31:17.576 --> 31:19.111
WAS ON THE WEEKEND.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.212
- I THOUGHT
IT WOULD LOOK BAD,

31:20.246 --> 31:21.914
BUT I WAS JUST
GIVING ARIEL A RIDE.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.149
- THE NIGHT SHE ENDS UP
ASSAULTED,

31:23.182 --> 31:24.616
YEAH, IT'S LOOKS PRETTY BAD.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.186
IF YOU WERE JUST
GIVING HER A RIDE,

31:27.219 --> 31:29.055
WHY NOT TELL US THAT?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.990
- MY GIRLFRIEND,
SHE GETS JEALOUS.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.324
- WHY'D YOU GO
TO THE HOSPITAL, PHIL?

31:32.358 --> 31:34.126
FINISH THE JOB?

31:34.160 --> 31:36.328
- NO. NO!
I WAS WORRIED.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.030
- WORRIED THAT SHE'D WAKE UP

31:38.064 --> 31:40.132
AND TELL US
YOU ATTACKED HER?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.667
- NOTHING LIKE THAT.
I DIDN'T HURT HER!

31:41.700 --> 31:43.435
- YEAH?
DID SHE HURT YOU?

31:43.469 --> 31:45.171
ARE WE GONNA FIND
ANY OF YOUR DNA

31:45.204 --> 31:47.673
UNDER HER FINGERNAILS?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.508
- WHAT?

31:49.541 --> 31:52.511
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
WHAT'S THAT?

31:52.544 --> 31:54.146
ARIEL SCRATCH YA?

31:54.180 --> 31:55.147
- IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.582
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP HER.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.117
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE NEEDED HELP?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.285
DID YOU FOLLOW HER
OUT OF THAT CLUB?

31:59.318 --> 32:00.953
- SHE LOOKED UPSET, OKAY?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.354
I OFFERED HER A RIDE,
SHE GOT INTO THE TRUCK.

32:02.388 --> 32:06.025
YOU SAW.
- THEN WHAT?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.493
YOU TRY TO TAKE HER HOME?

32:07.526 --> 32:09.061
- NO, I TOOK HER
OUT TO EAT.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.297
SHE SAID SHE WAS CONFUSED
AND HUNGRY.

32:11.330 --> 32:14.000
[stammering]
A DINER ON DITMARS.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.434
- DITMARS?

32:15.467 --> 32:19.105
RIGHT BY HELL GATE,
WHERE THE ROWBOATS ARE.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.974
- NO, WE DIDN'T
GO INTO THAT PARK.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.175
WE JUST HAD A SANDWICH.

32:23.209 --> 32:26.112
- YEAH, THEN WHY
DID SHE SCRATCH YOU?

32:26.145 --> 32:27.513
- [sighs]

32:27.546 --> 32:30.582
LOOK, ALL I DID
WAS TRY TO KISS HER.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.251
- AND THEN SHE TURNED YOU DOWN
AND YOU GOT ANGRY

32:32.284 --> 32:34.253
AND YOU TRY AND RAPE HER.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.722
- SHE WANTED TO GO
TO THE RIVER AT 2:00 A.M.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.257
I TRIED TO GET HER BACK.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.491
SHE PUSHED ME AWAY,
SCRATCHED ME,

32:39.525 --> 32:41.227
AND THEN HEADED
INTO THE PARK.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.561
- AND THEN YOU FOLLOW HER,
YOU TRY AND PULL HER

32:42.594 --> 32:44.263
BACK INTO THE TRUCK,
RIGHT?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.132
SHE HAS BITE MARKS
ON HER BREASTS.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.167
ARE WE GONNA FIND OUT
THOSE ARE A MATCH TO YOU TOO?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.102
- NO, I SWEAR,
I JUST TRIED

32:50.136 --> 32:53.172
TO STOP HER FROM GOING
INTO THE PARK.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.744
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY,
I'M SCREWED.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.283
I'M INVOKING MY RIGHTS.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.185
- YOU DO THAT,
WE CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.520
- YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T
HELP ME EITHER WAY.

33:08.554 --> 33:11.557
I WANT A LAWYER.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.366
- IS HE GOOD FOR IT?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.134
- WELL, HE LIED TO US.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.802
LOOK, HE FOLLOWED HER
OUT OF THE CLUB.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.671
HE PICKED HER UP IN HIS TRUCK,
SHE SCRATCHED HIM.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.173
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.174
- HE JUST ASKED FOR A LAWYER.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.675
- WELL, THE TIMELINE CHECKS,

33:29.708 --> 33:32.178
BUT WE GOT NOTHING
TO TIE HIM TO THE ASSAULT.

33:32.211 --> 33:32.978
- WE'LL GET
HIS DENTAL MOLDS,

33:33.011 --> 33:34.413
SEE IF IT MATCHES
HER BITE MARKS.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.048
- IT MAY NOT.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.549
LOOK, I KNOW HE HAD ARIEL
IN HIS TRUCK.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.185
BUT THEN HE CARRIES HER
THROUGH THE PARK,

33:39.218 --> 33:40.719
DUMPS HER IN A ROWBOAT?

33:40.752 --> 33:42.154
SOMEONE SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.390
- POINTS TAKEN.
ALL RIGHT.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.292
SEE IF ANY WITNESSES
CAN PUT THEM

33:46.325 --> 33:48.427
IN THE DINER OR THE PARK.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.562
AND GO BACK TO THE HUSBAND.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.632
SEE IF ARIEL SAID ANYTHING
TO HIM ABOUT PHIL.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.771
- PHIL DESAPIO--
DOES THAT NAME

33:59.805 --> 34:01.173
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.109
- ARIEL'S MENTIONED HIM.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.211
- DID SHE SAY
ANYTHING SPECIFIC?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.545
- JUST THAT HE WAS
A GOOD ENGINEER.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.280
D-DO YOU THINK
HE'S THE ONE?

34:08.314 --> 34:11.117
- WE'RE STILL
PIECING IT TOGETHER.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.419
- [sighs]

34:13.452 --> 34:15.454
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS

34:15.487 --> 34:17.523
FOR YOU AND YOUR BOYS.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.125
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO SHIELD THE BOYS

34:19.158 --> 34:20.526
FROM WHAT THE TABLOIDS
ARE GONNA SAY

34:20.559 --> 34:23.262
ABOUT THEIR MOTHER.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.364
- I UNDERSTAND.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.199
- WAYNE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE CONVERSATION

34:27.233 --> 34:28.634
THAT YOU HAD WITH HIM--

34:28.667 --> 34:31.470
ABOUT ARIEL PUTTING THE BOYS
IN SCHOOL HERE.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.838
- AND THAT WAS NEWS TO YOU?

34:32.871 --> 34:34.473
- YES.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.742
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.310
IN MY HEART,
I ALWAYS FELT

34:38.344 --> 34:41.347
THAT ARIEL MIGHT NOT
BE IN IT FOR THE LONG RUN.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.751
- WELL, YOU CAN'T BE SURE
ABOUT THAT.

34:45.784 --> 34:50.356
- I KNOW WHO I AM,
AND I KNOW WHO SHE IS.

34:50.389 --> 34:55.294
BUT THE CHILDREN
NEED THEIR MOTHER,

34:55.327 --> 34:57.163
AND I MADE A DEAL
LAST NIGHT.

34:57.196 --> 35:00.299
I TOLD GOD
IF HE LETS HER WAKE UP,

35:00.332 --> 35:03.902
THEN I'LL LET HER GO
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.672
- UH, MR. RANDOLPH--

35:06.705 --> 35:08.440
- I-I'D JUST LIKE TO BE
WITH MY WIFE AND BOYS NOW,

35:08.474 --> 35:09.908
IF IT'S OKAY.

35:32.431 --> 35:32.631
.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.365
- HOW ARE HER
LITTLE BOYS DOING?

35:33.865 --> 35:35.701
- OH, THEY'RE BRAVE.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.603
TABLOIDS ARE STILL DRAGGING
ARIEL THROUGH THE MUD.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.670
I MEAN, YOU SEE THE WAY
THE BOYS ARE WITH HER,

35:38.704 --> 35:40.639
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
THE STORY.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.609
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IF...

35:43.642 --> 35:46.778
- THANK GOD THEY'VE GOT
A GOOD DAD.

35:46.812 --> 35:52.718
- GOT THAT SECURITY FOOTAGE.
CAP'S WAITING.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.853
- AND THAT WAS 25 MINUTES
AFTER SHE LEFT THE CLUB.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.622
- THEY SAT AT THAT TABLE
FOR OVER AN HOUR,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.690
JUST HAVING A MEAL
AND TALKING.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.227
- SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO HER.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.961
- ANY VIDEO OF THEM
LEAVING TOGETHER?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.263
- YEAH, THERE'S
SURVEILLANCE CAM

36:04.296 --> 36:07.299
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.710
- THAT'S THE BACK
OF PHIL'S TRUCK.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.579
- AND THAT'S WHERE HE CLAIMS
THEY PARTED WAYS.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.649
HE TRIES TO KISS HER,
SHE GOES INTO THE PARK.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.651
- 2:00 A.M.,
INTO THE PARK ON HER OWN.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.219
- LOOK, IT'S POSSIBLE.
SHE'S FROM EDMONTON,

36:27.253 --> 36:28.654
COULD'VE MISREAD
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.422
- WE NEED AN EYEWITNESS
PUTTING ARIEL

36:30.456 --> 36:32.591
IN PHIL'S TRUCK
AFTER THEY LEFT THE DINER.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.526
- SO WE'VE STARTED UP
A GRID SEARCH IN THE PARK.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.694
- EVERYBODY GO UP THERE.

36:35.727 --> 36:39.531
SEE IF ANYBODY SAW ARIEL,
THE TRUCK, PHIL,

36:39.565 --> 36:42.934
ANYTHING TO TIE HIM TO
THE WATER'S EDGE, THE ROWBOAT.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.570
AND LET'S TRY TO FIND
THIS GUY.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.939
HE MUST'VE SEEN SOMETHING.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.676
[police radio chatter]

36:50.709 --> 36:54.613
[siren bloops]

36:54.646 --> 36:55.714
- SO?

36:55.747 --> 36:58.617
- SO DETECTIVES, YOU LOOKING
FOR A GOOD TIME OR WHAT?

36:58.650 --> 36:59.551
- ACTUALLY, NO.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.787
WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS GUY.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.389
- UH, THIS GUY.
YEAH, SURE.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.890
- WHEN?
- YOU TELL ME.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.625
YOU WANT ME TO SAY
I SAW HIM, SURE,

37:06.658 --> 37:07.926
YOU GOTTA PAY ME FIRST.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.596
- YO, YO, MAN.

37:10.629 --> 37:11.763
COME ON OUT.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.499
HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?

37:13.532 --> 37:15.301
- THIS IS MY "APARKAMENT."

37:15.334 --> 37:17.403
DON'T YOU KNOCK?
- ALL RIGHT, HEY.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.770
IS THIS GUY
ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS HERE?

37:18.804 --> 37:20.406
- I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL
FROM THAT?

37:20.439 --> 37:22.308
- HOW ABOUT THIS GUY.
YOU EVER SEEN HIM?

37:22.341 --> 37:25.043
- LET ME THINK.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.913
- HEY. WHERE'D YOU
GET THIS SCARF?

37:27.946 --> 37:29.815
- YO, SLICK,

37:29.848 --> 37:32.851
THEY WANNA KNOW WHERE
YOU GOT THAT GYPSY RAG.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.889
- HEY...HEY, AMARO!

37:37.923 --> 37:39.491
- HEY!

37:39.525 --> 37:40.892
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S THE HURRY?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.528
- I-I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.830
- WHY DON'T YOU TURN AROUND?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.064
- WHERE'D YOU
GET THE SCARF, HUH?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.799
- I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.835
[handcuffs clicking]

37:59.611 --> 38:00.646
- HE SAYS HE LIVES
IN THE PARK

38:00.679 --> 38:02.714
BECAUSE HE HAS
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.082
- HE'S RIGHT.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.651
HE'S A LEVEL THREE
SEX OFFENDER.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.619
- SO PHIL'S STORY
CHECKS OUT.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.754
WE GOT OUR MAN.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.989
- THE BLOOD ON HIS CLOTHES
MATCHES ARIEL RANDOLPH'S.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.659
HIS DENTALS AND DNA MATCH
THE BITE MARKS ON HER BREASTS.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.862
- FOUND HER PHONE,
HER PURSE, AND AN OAR

38:16.895 --> 38:18.864
WITH ARIEL'S BLOOD ON IT
IN HIS TENT.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.766
- SO AFTER HE ROBS
AND ASSAULTS HER,

38:20.799 --> 38:22.734
HE PUTS HER IN THE ROWBOAT
SO SHE WON'T BE FOUND

38:22.768 --> 38:24.503
ANYWHERE NEAR
WHERE HE LIVES?

38:24.536 --> 38:26.705
- THEY FOUND GLUE
AND BATH SALTS IN HIS TENT,

38:26.738 --> 38:28.840
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE "WHY,"

38:28.874 --> 38:31.343
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THERE.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.778
- OKAY.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.814
LET'S LET THE FAMILY KNOW.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.090
- IT WAS A HOMELESS MAN?

38:45.123 --> 38:47.025
- YOUR WIFE GAVE HIM
HALF A SANDWICH

38:47.058 --> 38:48.527
OUTSIDE A DINER.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.928
HE FOLLOWED HER
INTO THE PARK,

38:49.961 --> 38:53.765
MAYBE THOUGHT
HE CAN GET MORE FROM HER.

38:53.799 --> 38:54.866
- SO IT HAD NOTHING TO DO

38:54.900 --> 38:56.835
WITH THESE NEWS STORIES
ABOUT ARIEL?

38:56.868 --> 38:59.838
- NOTHING.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.542
YOUR WIFE WAS KIND
TO THE WRONG STRANGER.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.714
- [chuckles]

39:08.747 --> 39:12.584
SHE ALWAYS TOLD THE BOYS
WE WERE BLESSED,

39:12.618 --> 39:13.985
THAT WE SHOULD
LOOK AFTER THOSE

39:14.019 --> 39:16.388
WHO DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
AS WE DO.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.759
- DAD, DAD!

39:34.673 --> 39:36.675
- [sighs]

39:50.889 --> 39:54.860
- WE'RE VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR LOSS, MR. RANDOLPH.

39:54.893 --> 39:59.164
- I THINK SHE HELD ON
UNTIL YOU CAUGHT THE RIGHT MAN.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.100
AT LEAST WE WERE ALL
WITH HER.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.135
THE BOYS ARE TAKING IT HARD.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.171
- WELL, WE FOUND HER PHONE
IN THE PARK.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.739
SHE LEFT YOU A MESSAGE.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.743
- IT'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU AND THE BOYS SHOULD SEE.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.818
- HI, NAT.
IT'S TOO LATE TO VIDEO CHAT,

40:19.851 --> 40:21.520
SO I'LL SEND THIS
IN THE MORNING.

40:21.553 --> 40:22.754
I JUST WANTED
TO GET IT DOWN

40:22.788 --> 40:25.891
WHILE IT'S STILL FRESH
IN MY MIND.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.059
I KNOW
IT'S BEEN HARD LATELY,

40:28.093 --> 40:30.061
BUT I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR TRUSTING ME ENOUGH

40:30.095 --> 40:35.166
TO LET ME MAKE THIS TRIP
ON MY OWN.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.869
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS WITH US,

40:37.903 --> 40:42.107
BUT I DO KNOW
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN...

40:44.710 --> 40:49.080
AND A GOOD FATHER...

40:49.114 --> 40:51.917
AND I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.891
THIS NEXT PART
IS FOR WAYNE AND GRANT.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.709
GUYS, I AM FLYING HOME
TOMORROW NIGHT.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.211
I HAD A GREAT TIME,

41:20.245 --> 41:23.048
BUT I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.685
I REALIZED BEING YOUR MOM

41:26.718 --> 41:31.089
IS THE GREATEST ADVENTURE
I WANNA HAVE.

41:31.122 --> 41:34.192
I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.861
I LOVE YOU.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.564
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

41:38.597 --> 41:42.968
LISTEN TO YOUR DAD,
OKAY?

41:43.001 --> 41:47.038
GOOD NIGHT
AND SLEEP TIGHT.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.908
I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS.
