Previously on "Mr. Pickles"...

00:01.768 --> 00:03.153
Mr. Pickles is evil.

00:03.214 --> 00:04.763
You better have proof,

00:04.814 --> 00:07.559
or I'm gonna put you in the loony bin.

00:07.612 --> 00:09.828
I filmed evidence of Mr. Pickles' evil.

00:09.894 --> 00:12.939
But then he forced me
to dress up in a porno

00:12.941 --> 00:15.191
with a bunch of sheriff robots.

00:16.073 --> 00:19.395
Burn in hell, you dumb dog!

00:19.397 --> 00:22.115
- Ow!
- I thought you were a robot.

00:22.181 --> 00:24.147
It's off to the loony bin with you.

00:24.239 --> 00:26.369
But Mr. Pickles!

00:29.567 --> 00:31.572
Come here, baby.

00:31.676 --> 00:34.727
No. I'm sick of being the other woman.

00:34.729 --> 00:37.918
But you're so much more
important to me than Jill.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.398
I want it to be just us.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.067
Okay.

00:42.446 --> 00:43.673
Jill, can you give us a minute?

00:43.739 --> 00:44.687
Mm-hmm.

00:44.689 --> 00:47.106
Hey, do hookers take credit?

00:47.108 --> 00:49.692
Hooker?
I'm a high-class whore, you jerk!

00:49.694 --> 00:51.076
Hey, get back here, bitch!

00:51.078 --> 00:52.911
How 'bout I pay you in black eyes!

00:52.913 --> 00:54.530
No! Aah!

00:54.532 --> 00:57.005
Thanks a lot, you stupid dog!

00:59.511 --> 01:02.031
Mr. Pickles!

Sir, space trolls have
the frog queen prisoner

01:30.568 --> 01:31.723
under their space bridge.

01:31.776 --> 01:34.370
Sounds like a job for
Astronaut Dolphin Detective.

01:34.372 --> 01:37.990
Of course secret
societies control the TV!

01:38.049 --> 01:40.872
The secret
societies control your mind!

01:41.268 --> 01:43.162
I don't belong here.

01:43.164 --> 01:44.913
I'm not crazy.

01:44.915 --> 01:46.832
- Hair?!
- Get away from me.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.551
Perhaps if I lobotomize you,

01:49.553 --> 01:52.554
you'd no longer fear this evil dog.

01:54.392 --> 01:56.058
Aren't lobotomies illegal?

01:56.060 --> 02:00.062
Never mind that.
Come, you have visitors.

02:03.434 --> 02:05.601
- Grandpa!
- Hey, everybody.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.019
I've really missed you, Dad.

02:07.021 --> 02:08.770
I haven't had anybody to talk to.

02:08.773 --> 02:10.906
Well, no time to talk.
Got to get to work.

02:10.907 --> 02:12.858
Good to see you, Grandpa.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.910
Guess who else misses you, Grandpa.

02:14.912 --> 02:16.976
- Mr. Pickles!
- Oh, no!

02:17.174 --> 02:19.915
Well,
he won't be playing with him anymore.

02:20.459 --> 02:23.335
Grandpa's stuck in here now.

02:23.337 --> 02:25.037
Oh.

02:25.039 --> 02:27.206
You're right!

02:27.208 --> 02:29.541
Guess I'm stuck in here.

02:31.762 --> 02:34.430
- Oh.
- Visiting time is over.

02:34.432 --> 02:36.465
Bye!

02:36.467 --> 02:38.684
But we just got here!

02:38.686 --> 02:40.302
- Oh.
- I miss Grandpa.

02:42.842 --> 02:43.871
Hi!

02:44.029 --> 02:46.859
I think I'm a tomato.

02:46.861 --> 02:50.312
Great. Just fill out this
voluntary admission form.

02:50.314 --> 02:51.313
Come on, Tommy.

02:51.315 --> 02:54.283
Hey, where are you going, Mr. Pickles?

03:21.893 --> 03:23.679
You can't check yourself in.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.706
Who would run Old Town?

03:25.983 --> 03:27.618
Mr. Mayor?!

03:27.882 --> 03:30.402
I didn't expect to
hear about my proposal

03:30.404 --> 03:31.820
until the town hall meeting.

03:31.822 --> 03:33.405
Mr. Mayor?

03:33.407 --> 03:34.440
Mr. Mayor?

03:34.442 --> 03:35.908
Mr. Mayor!

03:35.910 --> 03:38.527
I've been looking everywhere for you.

03:38.529 --> 03:41.196
Come on. We have much to do.

03:45.336 --> 03:47.903
There you are, Mr. Mayor. Come on.

03:47.905 --> 03:51.006
Back off, people.
The mayor is very busy.

03:51.008 --> 03:52.208
And he'll see you as soon

03:52.261 --> 03:56.128
as he's not very, very, very, very busy.

03:58.923 --> 04:01.049
Here are the budgets for parks,
sanitation,

04:01.051 --> 04:02.921
the fire department, animal control.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.120
Date this, stamp this, sign here,

04:05.122 --> 04:08.557
and then it's time for
some last-minute proposals!

04:08.559 --> 04:09.662
Mr. Mayor?

04:09.741 --> 04:12.694
There you are, my husband, the mayor.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.899
Kissy, kissy? Hmm?

04:16.901 --> 04:19.317
Oh. You dirty dog!

04:19.320 --> 04:21.487
Oh!

04:24.375 --> 04:27.242
Come on, girl. You do yours outside.

04:30.163 --> 04:33.749
Oh. Now, Tommy,
it's sad that Grandpa's gone.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.551
But you and I can still talk.

04:35.553 --> 04:37.314
- Oh.
- Okay.

04:37.525 --> 04:40.246
- I found this new recipe the other day.
- Oh.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.925
Tommy,
I'd really like somebody to talk to.

04:42.927 --> 04:45.477
- Beverly.
- Eleanor!

04:45.479 --> 04:46.845
How are you?

04:46.847 --> 04:50.315
How do you think I am?
My husband is the mayor.

04:50.317 --> 04:53.368
Everybody's lining up to give
him their last-minute proposals.

04:53.421 --> 04:55.437
Oh. Could I give the mayor a proposal

04:55.439 --> 04:57.564
to get my grandpa out
of the mental asylum?

04:57.630 --> 05:01.109
My husband, the mayor,
has the power to approve anything.

05:01.111 --> 05:02.287
Oh, boy!

05:02.366 --> 05:04.112
I'm gonna go propose to the mayor.

05:04.114 --> 05:05.722
Oh, Tommy.

05:06.052 --> 05:09.251
Come, let's talk.
I heard about your father.

05:09.253 --> 05:10.419
Crazy!

05:10.511 --> 05:12.087
Hey!

05:12.089 --> 05:14.122
Hey, hey, hey! Whoo!

05:14.124 --> 05:16.124
Triple jump! King him, Lou.

05:16.126 --> 05:17.676
Yeah!

05:17.678 --> 05:20.095
- Hair?!
- Don't mind if I do!

05:20.097 --> 05:22.297
Whoo, whoo, whoo! I'm free!

05:22.706 --> 05:25.884
I'm safe from Mr. Pickles forever!

05:25.886 --> 05:27.603
Whoo-hoo!

05:27.605 --> 05:30.464
Hey! The secret societies are using us.

05:30.543 --> 05:31.857
The TV, that's how they get to us.

05:31.910 --> 05:33.642
I'm a tomato!

05:33.644 --> 05:35.811
And I'm a fruit fly!

05:35.813 --> 05:37.613
Wait!

05:37.615 --> 05:39.781
Maybe I'm a fruit fly.

05:42.081 --> 05:45.487
Wait a second. Something's wrong here.

05:46.407 --> 05:49.024
There. Much better.

05:49.026 --> 05:52.194
All right,
we have some last-minute proposals!

05:52.196 --> 05:54.363
Whoa!

05:54.468 --> 05:55.964
One at a time!

05:55.966 --> 05:57.382
I propose the legalization

05:57.384 --> 06:00.419
of illegal trafficking
of illegal machine guns.

06:01.807 --> 06:06.174
My proposal is to make toenails
the new currency of Old Town.

06:07.995 --> 06:10.679
I propose a toast!

06:10.681 --> 06:12.391
Cheers!

06:12.509 --> 06:14.933
Just look at my husband, the mayor.

06:14.935 --> 06:16.768
He's such a powerful man.

06:16.770 --> 06:18.353
I found a flag!

06:18.355 --> 06:21.073
Well, I propose that you let my grandpa

06:21.075 --> 06:22.791
out of the mental asylum.

06:25.245 --> 06:27.079
So, do you like to cook?

06:27.081 --> 06:29.197
- Ugh! I don't have to cook.
- Oh.

06:29.199 --> 06:31.950
- Because my husband is the...
- The mayor, right.

06:31.952 --> 06:34.786
- Yes.
- Moms, I gave the mayor my proposal,

06:34.788 --> 06:37.489
and I bet he's gonna let Grandpa out.

06:37.845 --> 06:41.343
But if he acts crazy again,

06:41.345 --> 06:43.578
he'll just wind up back in there.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.702
Sir, Astronaut Dolphin Detective

06:51.768 --> 06:53.048
defeated the space trolls,

06:53.127 --> 06:56.024
but now he's making
sex to the frog queen.

06:56.026 --> 06:58.060
Wait! I'm a frog!

06:58.062 --> 06:59.978
I'm sure of it now!

06:59.980 --> 07:03.031
- Ribbit! Ribbit!
- This show is a conspiracy!

07:03.033 --> 07:04.566
And we are live

07:04.568 --> 07:07.636
as the mayor is en route
to the town hall meeting.

07:07.638 --> 07:11.006
Cindy Spencer has the story.
Cindy, are you there?

07:12.409 --> 07:14.443
Sorry about that, Cindy. We are live.

07:14.445 --> 07:16.548
Wait a second. Is that...

07:16.931 --> 07:20.332
Whoa! Mr. Pickles is the mayor!

07:20.334 --> 07:22.968
The mayor will kill everybody!

07:22.970 --> 07:24.836
We're all in trouble!

07:24.838 --> 07:26.838
What's going on here?

07:26.840 --> 07:28.473
Mr. Pickles is the mayor! The mayor...

07:28.475 --> 07:30.258
- I'm a frog!
- Get off of me!

07:30.260 --> 07:32.511
You are not a frog! Take them away!

07:32.513 --> 07:35.564
- I'm a frog! Ribbit, ribbit!
- No!

07:38.577 --> 07:40.435
Nobody understands what it's like

07:40.437 --> 07:42.988
to be married to someone so important.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.323
- Mm-hmm.
- Take your husband, for example.

07:45.325 --> 07:47.242
He could disappear,
and it wouldn't matter.

07:47.244 --> 07:49.111
Hey, my husband is...

07:49.113 --> 07:51.079
Be quiet, everyone,

07:51.081 --> 07:56.451
and please welcome the mayor!

08:03.971 --> 08:06.795
Uh, you okay, Mr. Mayor?

08:06.797 --> 08:09.498
Uh, the mayor is very tired.

08:09.577 --> 08:11.967
So I will announce his decisions.

08:13.437 --> 08:17.305
The warden's proposal to
legalize lobotomies is approved!

08:19.260 --> 08:22.978
Illegal trafficking of
machine guns is now legal.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.312
- All right!
- What?

08:24.314 --> 08:27.115
Old Town's currency is now toenails.

08:27.117 --> 08:28.984
- I'm rich!
- Really?

08:28.986 --> 08:31.119
Good doing business.

08:31.121 --> 08:33.538
These decisions are crazy!

08:33.539 --> 08:36.658
How dare you?!
My husband, the mayor, isn't crazy.

08:36.659 --> 08:40.508
Linda, fire that machine gun outside,
please.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.932
Tommy Goodman's request

08:41.985 --> 08:45.667
to release his grandpa
from the asylum is...

08:45.669 --> 08:46.902
denied.

08:46.904 --> 08:49.801
Hey, Mayor, my grandpa's not crazy.

08:49.854 --> 08:51.973
He just tells funny stories.

08:51.975 --> 08:54.176
You're crazy for not letting him out.

08:54.178 --> 08:56.595
My husband, the mayor, is not crazy.

08:56.597 --> 09:00.515
He ate that fly! That's pretty crazy!

09:00.517 --> 09:03.819
Stop this!
My husband, the mayor, isn't crazy.

09:04.822 --> 09:07.169
His voice is kind of crazy.

09:07.222 --> 09:09.775
For the last and final time, my h...

09:12.412 --> 09:14.946
Excuse me. I am in the middle of...

09:16.250 --> 09:18.400
My hus...

09:18.402 --> 09:20.569
Ugh! What is your problem?

09:22.597 --> 09:25.173
The mayor is having sex with that dog!

09:25.175 --> 09:26.925
Huh?!

09:26.927 --> 09:28.960
Well, I guess that's pretty crazy.

09:28.962 --> 09:30.212
Take him away, Warden.

09:31.448 --> 09:35.383
Mom?
What was the mayor doing to that dog?

09:35.385 --> 09:38.787
You see,
sometimes a man loves a dog very much.

09:38.789 --> 09:40.388
You're a very lucky woman.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.224
Hey, where's Mr. Pickles?

09:49.700 --> 09:51.149
Come along, Mayor.

09:51.151 --> 09:53.368
- I'm a frog! I'm a frog!
- Shut up!

09:53.370 --> 09:57.122
You get the honor of
being my first lobotomy.

10:00.609 --> 10:02.614
What the...

10:03.463 --> 10:04.579
Oh.

10:04.581 --> 10:06.998
See?! Mr. Pickles is evil!

10:08.335 --> 10:10.552
What do you want?!

10:13.291 --> 10:16.972
Don't ever come back!

10:17.644 --> 10:19.505
- Grandpa!
- Dad?

10:19.676 --> 10:21.626
They let you out? But how?

10:21.692 --> 10:23.849
Mr. Pickles!

10:23.851 --> 10:25.934
Good boy!

10:25.936 --> 10:27.102
Oh!

10:27.104 --> 10:29.027
Oh, hey, hi, Grandpa.

10:31.024 --> 10:32.324
Huh?

10:38.448 --> 10:39.601
Uh!

10:41.857 --> 10:43.618
Whoa!

10:52.031 --> 10:54.429
Oh, hey, dude. See?

10:54.431 --> 10:56.932
I'm a frog! Ribbit!
