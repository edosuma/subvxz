WEBVTT

00:54.847 --> 00:57.057
Not again.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.142
Not ever again.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.438
You've betrayed me for the last time.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.943
God, I was such a fool.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.029
A woman in love.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.032
No more.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.495
I wouldn't bother to kill you

01:18.496 --> 01:22.791
except I'm so looking forward
to every last ounce of blood

01:22.792 --> 01:25.919
seeping out of your wretched body.

01:27.004 --> 01:31.341
If I believed in demons,
I'd damn your soul forever.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.635
I'd put a stake through your heart,

01:33.636 --> 01:36.387
if only you had one, you bastard.

01:39.391 --> 01:44.354
I just wish that I could do
to you what you did to me.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.984
But this will have to do.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.198
I don't believe it.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.954
- No?
- No.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.248
Audra could never pull the trigger.

02:03.249 --> 02:08.752
A woman discovering her lover
in bed with someone else?

02:08.753 --> 02:11.214
You don't know much about women...

02:11.215 --> 02:13.925
or love...

02:14.844 --> 02:17.346
or me.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.810
Well, what do you think?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.774
I mean, I know it needs work.

02:30.693 --> 02:33.361
The lighting will help. Camera moves.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.198
Stryker?

02:39.451 --> 02:41.828
Stryker?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.191
May I help you?

03:53.192 --> 03:54.651
We're here to see Dr. Pendleton.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.902
Have you got an appointment?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.654
He's expecting us.

03:57.655 --> 03:58.988
Your name?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.074
Stryker.

04:01.575 --> 04:05.829
There's a Mr. Stryker and a
lady to see Dr. Pendleton.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.164
Do you know who that lady is?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.291
That's Samantha Sherwood, you know?

04:10.292 --> 04:12.210
Yeah, I knew that.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.004
Uh, the doctor will
see you right away.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.173
It's the first room on the right,
just down the corridor.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.216
Excuse me, Miss Sherwood.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.718
May I have your autograph?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.763
Some other time.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.281
- Ah, Jonathan.
- Arthur.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.616
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.160
Samantha, this is
Dr. Arthur Pendleton.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.414
Hello, won't you sit down?

04:54.378 --> 04:57.255
Well, now, everything
seems to be in order.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.464
I spoke with Dr. Harrison

04:58.465 --> 05:01.175
and he confirmed what
you told me, Jonathan.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.343
So, we're all set?

05:02.344 --> 05:05.763
Yes. I just need a
couple of signatures.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.598
Now, if you'll sign here.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.476
All right.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.854
It's an honor to have you
here, Miss Sherwood.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.522
I'm a longtime fan of yours.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.774
I am looking forward
to seeing "Audra."

05:16.775 --> 05:20.111
The film's been shelved, temporarily.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.323
I didn't realize.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.908
Oh, I need one signature
from you, Miss Sherwood,

05:25.909 --> 05:27.828
if you'd sign here.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.960
That's it.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.172
I must say, Miss Sherwood,
from Dr. Harrison's report,

05:39.173 --> 05:43.634
I expected somewhat more
severe behavior from you,

05:43.635 --> 05:45.678
but I see no reason why
you shouldn't be back

05:45.679 --> 05:47.472
in front of the camera in no time.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.932
Those days are over, Doctor.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.143
I only hope she faked... Samantha!

05:52.144 --> 05:54.521
Attendant! Get in here!

05:57.649 --> 06:00.485
Let go of me! Let go of me, I say!

06:00.486 --> 06:03.029
Let go of me! Let go of my hand!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.697
Let go of me!

06:04.698 --> 06:09.378
What are you... No!
Don't do this! Go away!

06:10.996 --> 06:14.207
No! What are you doing?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.793
Get off! Get...

06:19.588 --> 06:21.798
Set her down over there.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.134
Good.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.181
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.350
I see what you mean.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.104
I think you should leave now.

06:36.105 --> 06:39.315
Doctor, I'd like to have a
moment alone with her, if I may.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.484
- Do you think that's wise?
- Well, look at her.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.945
What harm could she do
me or anyone else like that?

06:43.946 --> 06:45.613
All right.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.824
We'll be outside if you need us.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.910
Come with me.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.592
Audra herself couldn't
have done it better.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.511
I think that poor
doctor was in shock.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.513
- He's not the only one.
- Are you all right, darling?

07:10.514 --> 07:13.641
- You almost took my head off.
- Well, the thought did occur to me.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.352
- What a performance.
- Method acting.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.021
- You have to believe it to do it.
- Well, I'm convinced.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.190
Do you really think this
whole charade is necessary?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.775
Well, if I'm going to
play a mad woman,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.360
I've got to know
what it's really like.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.620
Don't you think this
is going a bit too far?

07:26.621 --> 07:28.239
Call it research.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.074
Oh. All for the sake
of a role in the film?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.869
All for the sake of getting it right.
And you as my director,

07:32.870 --> 07:35.121
you should applaud my dedication.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.171
You'd better go.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.840
- I liked you like this.
- Oh, yes?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.675
What sort of women have
you been seeing lately?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.478
None like you.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.755
Samantha, you look beautiful.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.340
Stick to directing, Jonathan.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.009
You make a terrible actor.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.552
I've missed you, too.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.763
I believe you.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.682
Why so defensive?

09:59.683 --> 10:01.809
Oh come on, Jonathan.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.563
Get enough psychiatric
babble in here as it is.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.233
Dr. Pendleton said
that you're doing well.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.777
Crazier than ever.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.321
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.098
Alice, what a pretty dress.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.934
Never seen you wear that one before.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.853
Oh, it's nothing.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.105
Don't get too many
chances to wear it here.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.899
It's pretty.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.860
May we dance?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.447
I think we better dance.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.564
I like the look.
It's very convincing.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.901
They believe it.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.778
They believe everything.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.657
Are they all so vacant?

11:41.243 --> 11:43.328
The sane ones.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.499
That's how you get by in here.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.961
Well, you can drop all
of this in front of me.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.171
Relax, save it for the film.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.174
So sad.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.386
- What is?
- Even their laughter's sad.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.389
Makes you cry.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.977
Have you ever wanted
something so badly

14:12.978 --> 14:15.479
you would do anything for it?

14:16.982 --> 14:19.483
Well, me, I want to be an actress.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.865
I wanted to be in pictures so badly,

14:25.866 --> 14:28.158
I screwed a guy from Fotomat.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.956
You know when they say
in and out in 24 hours?

14:33.957 --> 14:36.667
He was in and out in 24 seconds.

14:40.005 --> 14:43.549
I am off to a casting session.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.176
Whoo!

14:46.177 --> 14:49.514
Don't you wish you were
going to be there with me?

14:50.098 --> 14:52.057
Now, kind of imagine this...

14:52.058 --> 14:55.603
six actresses going to the same house

14:55.604 --> 14:58.523
to audition for the same part.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.193
Well, it sounds like a lot of
fun if you like blood baths.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.154
I mean, I can see it now,
the actress saying to me,

15:05.155 --> 15:08.157
"Excuse me, but I think that's
my knife in your back."

15:21.796 --> 15:23.964
Single audition for Stryker.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.008
Look, who does he think he is?

15:26.009 --> 15:29.136
I mean, God, who does he think I am?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.931
Relax, lady. The man
has strange ways,

15:31.932 --> 15:34.350
but he gets it done.
Have you seen the script?

15:34.351 --> 15:36.352
It's here somewhere.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.521
- Did you read it?
- I don't read without an offer.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.315
Brooke. Jesus, Brooke.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.026
I mean, if you wait for
an offer from Stryker,

15:44.027 --> 15:45.945
we'll both starve to death.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.988
Fuck you. You're the agent.
Get me one.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.115
It was all I could do to get
you the audition, dear.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.327
What you do for me is cash my checks.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.664
Nice work if you can get it, Monty.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.293
Just go see the man, okay?

16:02.671 --> 16:04.838
God, I look like shit.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.132
I should look so bad.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.219
- Have you seen the trades?
- The trades?

16:10.220 --> 16:13.180
Yes, have you seen
Friday's "Variety," dear?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.266
You know I never read that crap.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.352
Right.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.772
Jonathan Stryker said that
there was only one actress

16:21.773 --> 16:24.316
in the world who he'd
consider for Audra...

16:24.317 --> 16:26.902
you, cuckoo head!

16:26.903 --> 16:28.654
He said that about me?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.740
Yes, of course he did.
Well, not in so many words,

16:31.741 --> 16:33.867
but that was the general
gist of the thing.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.578
But I thought Samantha
Sherwood was playing Audra?

16:36.579 --> 16:38.455
Samantha Sherwood?

16:38.456 --> 16:42.502
Health problems. You're the one.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.964
That bastard.

16:46.965 --> 16:50.509
I still can't believe Stryker
left me in the asylum.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.344
If you hadn't sent "Variety,"
I never would have known

16:52.345 --> 16:55.014
he was going ahead without me anyway.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.308
I figured you'd be upset.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.229
What are you going to do now?

17:04.773 --> 17:07.652
Whatever I have to do to get it back.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.117
Well, aren't you in
enough trouble already?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.621
By now, they're bound
to know you've escaped.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.874
Let them come after me.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.585
What I have to do won't take long.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.922
Why don't you just forget about it?

17:28.923 --> 17:30.924
That's the one thing I'll never do.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.177
I didn't help you get out to
see you thrown back in again.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.763
- Why did you?
- You're my friend.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.182
I felt sorry for you.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.351
Stryker's the one you
should feel sorry for.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.855
This time, he's gone too far.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.988
Wow, you didn't put
up much of a fight.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.366
I didn't want a run in my stocking.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.839
This is getting a little boring.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.141
Well, there's always the pizza boy.

23:05.542 --> 23:09.554
No, too messy. Besides,
the pepperoni always sticks to my ass.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.682
That's the only way to keep it warm.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.643
- What about Pac-Man?
- What's that?

23:14.644 --> 23:16.895
Well, a depressed spinster
buys a home video game.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.438
She takes it that night.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.358
The monster comes alive and
eats everything in its way.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.652
Not tomorrow night, he doesn't.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.195
Well, he's easy, how about Saturday?

23:25.196 --> 23:28.115
Sunday. Keep the
little guy warmed up.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.950
Why, you going somewhere?

23:29.951 --> 23:32.744
Told you, this weekend is
Stryker's casting session.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.454
What kind of an audition is that?

23:34.455 --> 23:37.374
The guy invites six women up
to his house and calls it work.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.085
At least he's original.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.088
- I wish you wouldn't go.
- I want the part.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.341
- More then you want my part?
- Don't be silly.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.052
Much more than I want your part.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.430
It'd be funny if it weren't true.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.516
I won't pass up this chance.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.852
Might not be here when you get back.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.815
Well, then I just better give you
something to remember me by.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.361
You mean, straight? No games?

24:06.362 --> 24:09.698
I'm just me, and you're just you?

24:10.408 --> 24:13.743
Reality. That's different.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.468
The cold weather should continue

24:29.469 --> 24:32.387
with a good chance we'll see
some snow before it's over.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.766
So, find somebody warm and dig in.

24:38.811 --> 24:43.565
<i>'Cause you saved my soul...</i>

24:57.038 --> 25:00.832
<i>Gave my heart the dream...</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:48.257
Oh, God.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.152
Peter?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.703
Peter?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.875
Peter?

27:10.630 --> 27:13.590
Come on, Peter, no more games, huh?

27:41.202 --> 27:44.872
I first read the book
when I was a little girl.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.749
It was so beautiful.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.753
Do you know it?

27:52.922 --> 27:55.632
I am Audra.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.550
I am Audra.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.844
I'm not Audra.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.723
I am Audra.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.018
I am Audra.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.938
I'm not Audra.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.409
Uh, that's $10.25, lady.

28:22.410 --> 28:25.412
Well, it's here somewhere.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.541
Maybe you can work it off.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.461
I like older men, you know.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.630
14? 15?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.591
Hold this, please.

28:41.512 --> 28:44.514
- Are you a writer?
- No, actress.

28:44.515 --> 28:47.183
Yeah, I thought I'd
seen you on TV before.

28:47.184 --> 28:51.020
Not a chance, I would
have remembered you.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.022
Where you headed?

28:53.023 --> 28:54.858
Jonathan Stryker's place.
You know it?

28:54.859 --> 28:57.152
Yeah, just follow
the road up the hill.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.446
Say, do you know Miss Sherwood.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.823
Samantha Sherwood? I've heard of her.

29:01.824 --> 29:04.492
God, she was great.
Still is, I guess.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.703
Thanks.

29:18.132 --> 29:20.300
Thanks.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.788
Are we really all here
for the same part?

29:49.789 --> 29:51.831
He obviously doesn't
know what he wants.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.393
What could we all
possibly have in common?

29:55.394 --> 29:57.337
Sex?

30:00.508 --> 30:02.175
I mean, we're all women.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.894
You could have fooled me.

30:10.726 --> 30:14.854
- Aren't you Brooke Parsons?
- Yes, I am.

30:14.855 --> 30:18.191
The rest of us might as
well pack it in right now.

30:18.192 --> 30:22.279
- What are you doing here?
- I'd kill for the part.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.043
I'd fuck for it.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.204
Don't much want the part, huh?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.875
- What would you do for it?
- Oh, I don't know.

30:35.876 --> 30:40.380
Uh, tell a few jokes,
do a little song and dance,

30:40.381 --> 30:42.632
sell my mother into slavery.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.262
Go down on him.

30:48.848 --> 30:52.350
That shouldn't be necessary,

30:52.351 --> 30:54.269
but I'll keep it in mind.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.732
One of you is missing.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.694
I trust you'll keep us
amused, O'Connor.

31:05.322 --> 31:09.534
Parsons, I've long admired your work.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.788
Summers, hello.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.292
DeMillo. I look forward
to hearing you perform,

31:17.293 --> 31:20.086
DeMillo's a musician.

31:20.087 --> 31:23.048
Burns, you bring your skates?

31:24.633 --> 31:27.469
- Yes.
- Good.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.264
This is Matthew.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.392
And one of you is Audra.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.646
Which one, I don't yet know.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.402
The next two days will be
unlike any you've ever known.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.405
Not all of you will make it,

31:47.406 --> 31:51.075
but I promise, each of you
will have learned something

31:51.076 --> 31:53.620
about themselves and their craft.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.831
For all the good it will do you.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.713
We missed you at dinner.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.511
Ladies, may I present
Samantha Sherwood,

32:10.512 --> 32:13.348
an actress I've known for some time.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.725
You may remember her work.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.393
Samantha, may I introduce...

32:17.394 --> 32:19.687
No, don't bother, darling.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.690
They all look alike to me.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.652
Well, Stryker,

32:25.653 --> 32:29.072
is this your idea of
a casting session?

32:29.073 --> 32:31.825
Are you going to play, Samantha?

32:34.161 --> 32:36.329
You know I am.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.715
Hey!

33:33.804 --> 33:36.598
It's like old times,
isn't it, Samantha?

33:39.184 --> 33:41.811
You haven't changed a thing, Stryker.

33:41.812 --> 33:44.856
It's exactly as I left it.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.524
Why are you here?

33:46.525 --> 33:49.986
Why have you brought
those girls here?

33:49.987 --> 33:51.738
Forget it, Samantha.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.823
Perhaps once you were Audra.

33:53.824 --> 33:56.076
Today...

33:56.994 --> 34:00.329
But, I bought you
the rights to Audra.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.290
For which I am grateful.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.334
It was for us.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.463
Not anymore.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.010
Come on.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.138
You know I like you.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.014
Well...

34:19.016 --> 34:20.349
Come on.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.726
Just once.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.312
Come on.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.313
No, I don't.

34:26.315 --> 34:31.152
Come on, okay?

34:31.152 --> 34:33.529
Well...

34:33.530 --> 34:36.282
okay.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.159
Oh! Oh boy!

34:38.159 --> 34:40.195
You give great head!

34:40.496 --> 34:42.705
Gross.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.248
Wee bit past your bedtime,
isn't it, darling?

34:45.250 --> 34:48.628
Oh. Has anyone seen my skates?

34:48.629 --> 34:50.338
I can't seem to find my new pair.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.799
The girl thinks she's on holiday.

34:59.223 --> 35:01.682
Oh no. It's bad for your wind.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.476
I'm still in training.

35:05.479 --> 35:06.938
God knows why.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.773
I get up every morning
at dawn to practice.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.027
- Dawn?
- I bet you're fun on dates.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.989
It makes me feel good.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.118
Guess you got to want it
more than being loved.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.538
Isn't that how you feel about acting?

35:23.539 --> 35:26.332
It depends on the love.

35:30.504 --> 35:32.339
I suppose.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.469
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.478
You don't like her?

35:47.479 --> 35:50.940
What's she doing here?
She's just a baby.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.575
You nervous, too?

36:00.576 --> 36:03.119
Me?

36:03.120 --> 36:05.163
I'm scared to death.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.540
But you've been doing this for years.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.335
I can remember seeing you in...

36:11.420 --> 36:14.172
I started early.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.340
It never gets easier.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.844
Well, there's always
the casting Jacuzzi.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.680
What?

36:26.560 --> 36:30.689
It's like the casting
couch, only wetter.

36:31.398 --> 36:34.525
- I won't give up.
- Spare me the melodrama.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.735
If it wasn't for me,

36:35.736 --> 36:38.571
- you wouldn't even have a project.
- I'd find something.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.948
Oh, you're a hypocrite and a liar.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.201
You never intended to
get me out, did you?

36:43.202 --> 36:45.786
I did what I felt was best
for everyone involved.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.663
Deserting me in an asylum?

36:47.664 --> 36:48.998
It was your idea to commit yourself.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.166
But not forever.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.834
I'm not convinced you're cured yet.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.878
Oh, Stryker, I was never insane.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.546
Perhaps I should
call the good doctor.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.174
Let him know where you are.
I suspect he'd be most interested.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.342
Well, I'll tell him the truth.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.927
And I'll deny everything.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.678
And you, my dear, will move back

37:02.679 --> 37:06.349
- into Restview Manor permanently.
- I'll die first.

37:09.061 --> 37:12.939
I was just passing by
and I heard voices.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.066
Come in, my dear, come in.

37:16.026 --> 37:19.278
What you heard is a scene I wrote
many years ago for a play.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.364
A very bad play.

37:21.365 --> 37:22.865
A very bad play indeed.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.035
Saved only by your talent
and beauty, Samantha.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.788
A play?

37:28.789 --> 37:30.498
You mean, it was all a joke?

37:30.499 --> 37:33.167
Well, let's call it a performance.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.670
But it sounded so real.

37:37.756 --> 37:41.008
Tricks of the trade, my dear,
tricks of the trade.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.927
Give the people what
they want to believe in.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.096
It's part of our profession.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.431
But how did you know I was
standing outside the door.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.393
Well, it seems I've
developed a sixth sense...

41:20.145 --> 41:22.188
<i>We went together</i>

41:23.607 --> 41:26.359
<i>For so long</i>

41:28.153 --> 41:31.113
<i>Every second record on the radio</i>

41:31.114 --> 41:34.117
<i>Seemed like our song</i>

41:36.161 --> 41:39.288
<i>How we hurt each other, baby</i>

41:39.289 --> 41:42.458
<i>Baby, it was so wrong</i>

41:44.169 --> 41:46.712
<i>Something in the bottom of my heart</i>

41:46.713 --> 41:49.173
<i>Will keep me holding on</i>

41:52.511 --> 41:54.512
<i>We were lovers</i>

41:54.513 --> 41:58.808
<i>In the young and strong and bold days</i>

42:00.268 --> 42:02.561
<i>Turned them into treasures</i>

42:02.562 --> 42:06.858
<i>Of silver and gold days</i>

42:08.318 --> 42:10.653
<i>Even though we're older</i>

42:10.654 --> 42:14.615
<i>There's still nothin'
like the old days</i>

42:16.493 --> 42:18.953
<i>Something in the bottom of my heart</i>

42:18.954 --> 42:21.205
<i>Will keep me holding on</i>

42:23.500 --> 42:27.503
<i>'Cause you saved my soul</i>

42:27.504 --> 42:31.549
<i>You came along and took
me out of the night time</i>

42:31.550 --> 42:35.344
<i>Yes, you saved my soul</i>

42:35.345 --> 42:38.848
<i>Taught me to fly</i>

42:39.683 --> 42:43.143
<i>And I gave my heart...</i>

43:06.209 --> 43:08.586
Oh.

43:11.965 --> 43:14.008
Oh.

47:44.112 --> 47:46.781
Has anyone seen Christie?

47:47.282 --> 47:49.492
She's gone.

47:51.744 --> 47:54.372
She left a note under
my door this morning.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.208
Apparently, she couldn't handle it.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.169
I know how she feels.

48:02.422 --> 48:05.632
How did she get out with
the road snowed in?

48:05.633 --> 48:07.676
Maybe Matthew took her.

48:11.556 --> 48:13.098
Well, I wonder what changed her mind.

48:13.099 --> 48:15.434
She was perfectly alright last night.

48:20.523 --> 48:22.525
And then there were four.

48:24.777 --> 48:26.695
Christie must've had
a difficult night.

48:26.696 --> 48:28.947
Did she? I wouldn't know.

48:28.948 --> 48:30.490
Wouldn't you?

48:30.491 --> 48:33.785
Let's start with you, Parsons.
You're the veteran.

48:35.622 --> 48:39.250
No, I am.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.543
This isn't really
necessary, Samantha.

48:44.213 --> 48:48.300
Oh, but it is, obviously.

48:49.469 --> 48:50.969
I know what you can do.

48:50.970 --> 48:52.554
Then why are they here?

48:52.555 --> 48:54.807
Can we talk about this later?

48:58.269 --> 49:00.479
I don't want to talk.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.689
I want to act.

49:02.690 --> 49:05.275
All right.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.236
Take center stage.

49:30.802 --> 49:33.595
So, what the hell are you doing here?

49:33.596 --> 49:35.889
- I'm an actress.
- You're an actress.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.975
There's an echo in here.

49:37.976 --> 49:40.477
Your turn will come.

49:40.478 --> 49:42.312
What makes you think you can act?

49:42.313 --> 49:43.981
- I know I can.
- Could?

49:43.982 --> 49:46.609
- Can.
- So, act.

49:48.444 --> 49:51.447
- What?
- Act for us.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.534
I could do a prepared piece.

49:55.535 --> 49:58.496
I've seen them all before.

49:59.872 --> 50:04.501
You're such a perfect lady.

50:04.502 --> 50:08.339
So beautiful, so refined.

50:10.341 --> 50:14.512
What if you weren't so gifted?

50:15.179 --> 50:17.681
How would you act then?

50:20.810 --> 50:22.394
- I don't think...
- Good.

50:22.395 --> 50:24.438
Don't think, just do it.

50:25.732 --> 50:30.361
Make yourself ugly for us.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.373
Can you?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.544
What if your face were different?

50:47.462 --> 50:49.797
It could be one day, you know.

50:50.715 --> 50:54.552
Hideous, repulsive.

50:57.013 --> 50:59.056
Put it on.

51:01.434 --> 51:03.644
Put it on.

51:30.379 --> 51:32.589
Now seduce me.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.633
No words.

51:34.634 --> 51:39.179
You can make sounds
if you like, but no lines.

51:42.809 --> 51:46.937
No touching. Just the mask.

51:49.023 --> 51:54.153
Use your eyes, your mouth...

51:55.196 --> 51:57.656
and horrible beauty.

52:00.368 --> 52:02.953
Make me love you.

52:02.954 --> 52:05.831
Make me desire you.

52:05.832 --> 52:07.999
You're beautiful remember?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.836
You can't be denied.

52:21.222 --> 52:23.849
This is a mask, too.

52:24.350 --> 52:27.227
Are you satisfied?

52:31.190 --> 52:36.487
All right, page 58,
the seduction scene.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.287
Medics!

53:28.998 --> 53:31.374
You want me to sit there, right?

53:31.375 --> 53:33.544
Right.

53:44.347 --> 53:47.015
Ah, so...

53:47.016 --> 53:50.185
I guess you're wondering
why I called you here, right?

53:53.446 --> 53:58.168
Well, Doc, you see, it all started when
my mother locked me in the closet.

54:01.697 --> 54:04.825
I was 21 at the time.

54:11.249 --> 54:13.458
You want me to wear the mask?

54:13.459 --> 54:15.794
No, that's not necessary.

54:15.795 --> 54:18.588
Too bad. Might be an improvement.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.715
Mm.

54:20.716 --> 54:23.510
Oh, boy, this is what
you call bombing, right?

54:24.762 --> 54:26.346
Are you on something?

54:26.347 --> 54:29.057
Oh, God, don't I wish.

54:29.058 --> 54:31.226
Oh, I'm on nerves, actually.

54:31.227 --> 54:34.437
Sheer, raw nerves. And if
we don't get on with this,

54:34.438 --> 54:37.691
I'm liable to break down
right before your very eyes.

54:37.692 --> 54:41.236
Oh, I don't think that's
necessary either.

54:41.237 --> 54:44.656
In fact, this whole
session isn't necessary.

54:44.657 --> 54:47.159
Why?

54:49.996 --> 54:53.331
- You're a very talented...
- Joke, right?

54:53.332 --> 54:56.042
Good for a laugh but
nothing serious, is that it?

54:56.043 --> 54:59.087
Oh, yeah, tell me
something I don't know.

55:01.132 --> 55:03.341
What makes you think
you're right for Audra?

55:03.342 --> 55:05.635
I'm as right as anybody
else you've got here.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.805
I mean, God damn it, you haven't
spent five minutes with me

55:08.806 --> 55:10.932
and now you're telling me
I'm wrong for the part?

55:10.933 --> 55:13.268
Why? Because I haven't got a staple

55:13.269 --> 55:14.894
through my navel
like that centerfold?

55:14.895 --> 55:17.856
Because I wouldn't pirouette into bed
with you and skate on your face?

55:17.857 --> 55:19.816
I mean, what the hell are
you looking for anyway

55:19.817 --> 55:21.192
and what do you want from me?

55:21.193 --> 55:24.404
I mean, who the fuck is Audra anyway?

55:30.161 --> 55:33.163
You enjoying yourself?

55:33.164 --> 55:35.666
Showing a little bit of Audra.

55:44.925 --> 55:48.512
You bastard.

55:50.348 --> 55:52.098
Where's the mask?

55:52.099 --> 55:53.558
What do you mean?

55:53.559 --> 55:55.393
What the hell are you
up to, Samantha?

55:55.394 --> 55:57.270
What am I up to?

55:57.271 --> 56:02.025
You bring five totally different girls
here on a bogus casting session

56:02.026 --> 56:04.444
for a part that was
mine in the first place,

56:04.445 --> 56:07.322
and you ask me what I am up to?

56:15.206 --> 56:19.209
No more. I wouldn't
bother to kill you,

56:19.210 --> 56:22.796
except I'm so looking forward
to every last ounce of blood

56:22.797 --> 56:25.173
seeping out of your wretched body.

56:25.174 --> 56:28.510
If I believed in demons,
I'd damn your soul forever.

56:31.389 --> 56:33.431
I'd put a stake through your heart

56:33.432 --> 56:36.226
if only you had one, you bastard.

57:19.979 --> 57:22.356
Oh! Oh.

59:03.749 --> 59:06.459
No, no, no, no, no.

59:06.460 --> 59:09.087
You're a man seducing a woman.

59:09.088 --> 59:11.172
Now forget your sex.

59:11.173 --> 59:14.926
Enter into his imagination.
Become one with him.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.813
Use your vulnerability.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:43.849
No!

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.978
Brooke?

01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:52.340
Christie.

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:55.402
What about her?

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:58.655
She's dead.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.324
No, you've had a nightmare.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.159
- No.
- No one is dead.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.828
- But I saw her.
- You're imagining things.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.830
Let me take you to your room.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.249
- No.
- Maybe I should.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.085
We'll continue later.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.795
- Come on.
- Please, no.

01:01:13.796 --> 01:01:16.214
- There's nothing there.
- Please.

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:18.718
Come on.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:24.055
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no!

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.890
- Come on!
- Please, no!

01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.059
What the hell is frightening you?

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.895
Christie.

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:34.107
- Christie.
- Don't, don't go in.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:54.252
There's absolutely nothing in there.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:57.255
Go on, take a look.

01:02:00.676 --> 01:02:03.094
Don't, please.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:10.644
There, in there.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:18.192
No!

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.493
Come on.

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:30.413
Come on. You're gonna lose it.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.982
Get some rest.

01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.485
How is she?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:44.904
I don't know, the door's shut.

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:46.989
Stryker's probably
trying to calm her down.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.408
I'll bet.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:53.663
Why would she say that?
Christie's dead?

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.498
She's been drinking a lot.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.000
Yeah, but that doesn't explain
Amanda never arriving,

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:01.838
Matthew's disappeared. I'm scared.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:06.133
Maybe Brooke is smarter
than we think.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:07.802
What do you mean?

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:11.431
Brooke is acting just like Audra.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:19.021
Well, yeah, I suppose,
but aren't you being a little...

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.315
- Cynical?
- Yeah.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.402
Well, all's fair in love

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:27.405
and auditions.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:43.773
It's like old times,
isn't it, Samantha?

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.321
Audra herself couldn't
have done it better.

01:05:50.322 --> 01:05:53.241
I thought that doctor was
going to go into shock.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.994
Are you going to play, Samantha?

01:05:56.995 --> 01:06:00.164
Why have you brought
those girls here?

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.791
Forget it, Samantha.

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:03.918
Perhaps, once you were Audra.

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:06.337
Today...

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:14.442
Tell me about Audra.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.738
What is it you want to know?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.622
What's she like?

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:34.962
Is she anything like me?

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.590
Is she anything like the others?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.053
Can't you tell me?

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.705
Help!

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.666
Patti!

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.461
Brooke! Somebody!

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:00.130
Damn it! Come on!

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.425
Oh, come on.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.889
Matthew!

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.836
Help, somebody!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:33.469
Help! Help me!

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.877
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:49.034
Come on.

01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:56.875
Oh, please.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:20:00.170
Come on, shut.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.650
Please.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:54.326
No! No! No!

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:57.162
No! Oh no!

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:59.456
Please, no!

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.336
Oh!

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:55.929
There's plenty more
in the refrigerator.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:25.041
Audra would know how to
open a bottle of champagne.

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:28.086
She would have smashed the
bottle against the counter

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.505
and drank from the broken neck.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:32.674
How do you know'?

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:35.093
It's what I would do.

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:38.972
Too violent.

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:41.683
Audra was mad.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:44.769
Did you know that I was in an asylum?

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.231
I heard you were sick.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.816
He thought so.

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:53.153
He left me there.

01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:56.156
Stryk?

01:23:56.157 --> 01:24:00.160
I had myself committed to
learn what Audra knew.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.956
And what did you find out?

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:09.670
That an actress must
always be in control.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.383
If you know what you're doing,
you're doing it wrong.

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:18.220
That's what Stryker would have said.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.558
We're the same.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.686
He would have liked that.

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:28.980
He was fond of disciples.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.692
Young, pretty ones.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.153
Was?

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:37.822
Where is he?

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:40.116
Gone.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:41.659
He left?

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.578
He's dead.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.706
It wasn't supposed
to be like that, I...

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:49.000
It's all over now.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.002
Go back.

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:54.380
Go back to the acting classes
and the dinner theater,

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:55.840
the chorus line.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.509
Wait tables, be somebody's secretary,

01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:00.512
get married, grow old together.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:04.349
Forget about Audra.

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.520
Have I shocked you?

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:13.024
I'm not sorry.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:16.611
- Tell me what you've done.
- I killed Stryker.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:20.490
You want to call the police,
go ahead. I'm not going anywhere.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:26.830
Don't worry, I won't hurt
any of your friends.

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:29.166
It's only me.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.793
What do you mean?

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.965
They're dead, too.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.010
What?

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.847
You?

01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:46.683
Why?

01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:52.647
Have you ever wanted
something so badly,

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.275
you'd do anything for it?

01:25:55.276 --> 01:25:56.776
Me?

01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:58.987
I wanted to be an actress.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:05.076
I mean, I wanted to be
in pictures so badly,

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:07.370
I screwed a guy from Fotomat.

01:26:09.582 --> 01:26:13.168
You know when they say
in and out in 24 hours?

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:16.129
He was in and out in 24 seconds.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.675
Well, I know what you're wondering.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:23.845
The question is, can she act?

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:25.638
Right? That's what you're wondering.

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:28.349
Can she make it? I mean, can I act?

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.268
Just ask my boyfriend.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:35.524
Better yet, ask my mother.
