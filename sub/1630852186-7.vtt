A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:18.500 --> 00:20.625
-Good morning, daddy.
-Good morning, queen.

00:21.375 --> 00:25.000
-Wanna fuck?
-Yes. You do, too. Come look at this.

00:30.458 --> 00:31.291
Look out there.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.250
They're Brazilians. We haven't seen
a Brazilian boat in a long time.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.083
The last ones that came
were Puerto Ricans or Guyanese people.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.500
No idea.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.291
They look friendly.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.208
The CIA, FBI,

00:46.291 --> 00:49.041
and Interpol also have agents
that look friendly.

00:49.125 --> 00:52.083
Come on, man. They're tourists.
You can see it in their faces.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.291
My love.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.333
We need to socialize.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.583
I'm serious. Couples need a social life.

01:02.666 --> 01:05.416
They go to parties, they go
to the movies, they dine out.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.291
They don't hang out with Kuna Indians
or play beach tennis every day.

01:09.375 --> 01:11.375
-No.
-No, what?

01:11.458 --> 01:12.291
No.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.125
-Please, come on.
-No. No way.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.833
Tokyo, it's a safety measure.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.000
Hey!

01:36.791 --> 01:38.583
Hey!

01:38.666 --> 01:40.708
Hello, my friends!

01:50.416 --> 01:55.458
Rio! Rio! Rio!

01:55.541 --> 01:58.000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

01:58.083 --> 02:01.250
Rio! Rio! Rio!

02:01.333 --> 02:03.500
Rio! Rio! Rio!

02:03.583 --> 02:06.791
Rio! Rio! Rio!

02:27.291 --> 02:29.500
<i>Aníbal Cortés is walking</i>

02:29.583 --> 02:31.208
<i>towards the Bank of Spain.</i>

02:31.291 --> 02:37.125
<i>The Spanish police are handing over one</i>
<i>of the most wanted fugitives in the world.</i>

02:37.208 --> 02:40.000
<i>It's been 44 hours</i>
<i>since the beginning of the robbery</i>

02:40.083 --> 02:43.875
<i>and the police yield, handing over Cortés.</i>

02:43.958 --> 02:46.541
<i>He's the presumably tortured man.</i>

02:46.625 --> 02:49.375
<i>The Professor's gang is together again.</i>

02:58.333 --> 02:59.958
<i>Rio is at the bank's door.</i>

03:00.375 --> 03:01.375
<i>It's your turn.</i>

03:03.416 --> 03:04.250
Doors.

03:23.916 --> 03:24.875
Helsinki,

03:25.500 --> 03:27.708
<i>-green light.</i>
-Move forward!

03:59.708 --> 04:02.375
HOSTAGE EXCHANGE AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

04:34.291 --> 04:35.291
You're so handsome!

04:36.041 --> 04:38.541
So handsome, with a tie and all!

04:38.625 --> 04:41.083
It's the only nice thing
the police did for me.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.500
I can imagine.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.333
<i>You're so beautiful in the red jumper.</i>

04:48.416 --> 04:49.583
<i>How are you?</i>

04:49.791 --> 04:50.916
<i>-Better.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:54.583
What the fuck are you doing
in the Bank of Spain?

04:55.791 --> 04:56.708
We came to get you.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.958
Everything is over.
You're going back home, friends!

05:05.041 --> 05:07.708
All of Spain is with you!

05:08.458 --> 05:10.833
Brave! You're so brave!

05:11.500 --> 05:13.708
Don't worry. You're with me now.

05:18.291 --> 05:21.166
Let's see what Suárez can tell us now.
There he is.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.541
Suárez, easy!

05:22.666 --> 05:24.750
-I want to go back in!
-Calm down.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.875
Give me more men! Explosives!
We were so close! I'm going to kill them!

05:27.958 --> 05:29.666
-Calm down, please!
-Tamayo!

05:31.291 --> 05:32.708
What's that idiot doing?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.958
It's Arturo Román.
The Royal Mint's former director.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.333
Close the doors!

05:44.916 --> 05:46.291
That fucker!

05:56.083 --> 05:58.375
Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm unarmed.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.291
I'm Arturo Román.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.000
Arturito?

07:14.375 --> 07:16.666
A big applause! Come on!

07:23.708 --> 07:25.583
You're Arturo Román, aren't you?

07:26.375 --> 07:27.250
Of course.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.291
I read your book.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.125
You're fucking crazy!

07:35.541 --> 07:38.541
You could be out there,
living the good life,

07:39.416 --> 07:41.958
but you're here,
in the fucking lion's den.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.291
Do you know what a ruckus
you've raised out there?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.875
Give Helsi a big hug!

07:53.958 --> 07:55.916
You may be a war nutjob, Helsinki,

07:56.458 --> 07:58.083
but you're a sweetheart!

07:58.958 --> 08:00.583
-Hi!
-Hi!

08:01.916 --> 08:03.208
What should I call you? Mónica?

08:03.291 --> 08:04.791
No, Stockholm.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.375
Okay. Brother!

08:11.375 --> 08:13.125
What did you smoke to come back here?

08:13.208 --> 08:15.416
The life of a millionaire is very boring.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.541
Thanks, man.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.291
That you're here,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.333
after everything you've lost,
means a lot to me.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.166
Little one!

08:25.458 --> 08:28.791
-Little one! Let me give you a kiss.
-How are you, beautiful?

08:29.416 --> 08:32.250
I couldn't be happier
even if I had given birth to you.

08:32.666 --> 08:33.666
You're all fucking great.

08:33.750 --> 08:37.583
Yes, we're great, but the one who pushed
us forward was your ugly girlfriend.

08:37.666 --> 08:39.083
-If it wasn't for her...
-Stop that.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.291
You'll have to excuse me,
but... it's my turn.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.208
<i>I will be back shortly.</i>

08:46.250 --> 08:47.166
How are you doing?

08:48.083 --> 08:49.500
Positive for halothane.

08:49.791 --> 08:52.750
But there is no trace
of any other substances. We're fine.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.333
I'm glad. They won a battle, not the war,
so cheer up, for fuck's sake!

08:57.833 --> 08:59.041
Everyone, hear me!

08:59.625 --> 09:01.125
This operation never happened.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.000
-Understood?
-Really?

09:04.041 --> 09:07.125
Not even a Burkina Faso commando
would do what we have done.

09:07.666 --> 09:09.166
Show a little bit of respect.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.250
This isn't going to escalate.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.916
There are no victims,
we've gotten 40 hostages out,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.708
so let's think about it positively
and let's move forward. Please.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.833
Yes, yes, I'm positive. Look.
Very positive.

09:20.916 --> 09:22.791
The problem is we never learn the lesson.

09:23.375 --> 09:27.083
That guy is like Einstein, and our four
GEOs broke into the Bank through a toilet.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.291
We did what was necessary.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.791
What did the Navy Seals do
during the search for Bin Laden's?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.958
What did the Russians do
in the Dubrovka Theater?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.291
Exactly what the handbook says.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.541
How long did it take for us
to make this decision?

09:38.625 --> 09:39.916
Twenty minutes?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.500
Because that guy had years
to decide how to respond.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.625
Every move we make,
he knows how to counteract it.

09:45.708 --> 09:49.041
These operations are always risky. Always.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.666
Unless you want to enlighten us
with a riskless proposition.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.416
Not one,

09:55.416 --> 09:57.083
at least three.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.583
Antoñanzas, give me a donut.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.291
Mónica.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.416
-You look beautiful.
-I'm Stockholm.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.583
Stand here.

10:16.291 --> 10:17.166
Lift your shirt.

10:22.291 --> 10:23.125
Raise your arms.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.541
Why did you come, Arturo?
They could've shot you.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.500
I don't care.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.125
I stopped caring about my life when...

10:33.666 --> 10:34.833
when I lost everything.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.500
Laura left me and took the kids with her.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.833
I live in an apartment that has
a kitchen in a closet.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.250
I eat canned tuna.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.500
And the boxes from the move
are still in the hall, but...

10:47.250 --> 10:49.625
Well, I'm getting over it.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.750
Little by little, Arturo.

10:55.625 --> 10:59.000
Listen. I know I was horrible
to you and my wife.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.166
I admit it.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.291
I think about Laura constantly, but...

11:04.375 --> 11:06.125
Not as I much as I think about you.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.916
I always think about you.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.791
About you and about our son.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.583
Because he's a boy, isn't he?

11:12.666 --> 11:15.166
Yes, he's a boy. Put the jumper on.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.458
I know I've lost you, Mónica.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.833
But I don't want to lose my son.

11:24.916 --> 11:27.708
You lost him the moment you said
you weren't his father.

11:27.791 --> 11:28.916
Put the jumper on, please!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.458
But what did you expect?

11:33.208 --> 11:37.375
Do you know how hard it is
for a married man with three kids to hear:

11:37.625 --> 11:40.750
"Look at the test.
My son is yours." I was scared!

11:41.541 --> 11:43.791
Yes, I was scared shitless.

11:44.958 --> 11:47.125
Who doesn't get scared
with something like that?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.916
But it was only three minutes.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.041
Three minutes. The time it took
for those terrorists to come

11:54.125 --> 11:55.833
and start shooting at everyone.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.958
I'm asking you, please,
don't judge me on those three minutes.

12:01.666 --> 12:04.500
I know I don't have any right
to appear out of thin air

12:06.333 --> 12:08.333
and ask you to let me be
the father of my son.

12:09.083 --> 12:09.958
I know.

12:10.916 --> 12:13.875
But I want to see him, that's all.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.708
I don't know.
To touch him and know how he is.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.541
And I swear I don't care where he is.
I can go to Brazil,

12:20.625 --> 12:24.041
Romania, Burma, Thailand... wherever.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.416
He's my son and I want to meet him.

12:31.791 --> 12:32.625
Please.

12:35.541 --> 12:39.041
You may have the right to meet him,
but I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.208
I will try, okay?

12:44.750 --> 12:45.791
Thank you.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.750
Thank you.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.833
Some things never change.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.666
What?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.875
Look at what you do to me.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.291
-Really, Arturo?
-Look how hard you make me.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.500
This is the effect you have on me.

13:06.583 --> 13:09.500
Remember when we did it on my desk?
You can't have changed that much.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.583
Touch me again and you're dead.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.500
You disgust me, Arturo!

13:19.416 --> 13:20.583
You disgust me.

13:21.791 --> 13:24.333
Disgust? I disgust you?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.041
Shoot!

13:26.166 --> 13:30.000
Shoot me here, because if you don't,
this is the only face your son will see.

13:30.083 --> 13:33.166
You and Denver will go to jail
for a long time.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.875
Arturito Junior will never know
who his mother was.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.625
But he's going to call me Dad! Me!

13:38.708 --> 13:42.166
His legitimate father!
That's why I came, do you get it?

13:55.166 --> 13:57.041
My son's name is Cincinnati.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.250
And you won't see him
in your fucking life!

14:05.208 --> 14:07.666
Helsinki, can you finish here?

14:08.125 --> 14:09.125
Arturito.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.333
Calm down.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.916
You know, a man takes care of a man.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.541
Come on. Take your clothes off.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.458
<i>This was the happiest moment</i>
<i>of the robbery.</i>

14:50.875 --> 14:53.541
<i>It may even be</i>
<i>the happiest moment of my life.</i>

14:54.625 --> 14:56.250
<i>But happiness is a lightning bolt.</i>

14:56.541 --> 14:58.708
<i>An exhalation, and then,</i>

14:59.208 --> 15:00.375
<i>you fall.</i>

15:00.875 --> 15:04.166
<i>When you've touched the sky,</i>
<i>the fall is colossal.</i>

15:05.791 --> 15:08.500
<i>We were all plunging into an abyss,</i>

15:09.333 --> 15:10.708
<i>even the Professor.</i>

15:18.041 --> 15:21.000
First thing, we're making
the same mistake we did

15:21.083 --> 15:24.041
in the previous robbery,
which is trying to catch the Professor.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.833
He's a professional deceiver.
We have to change strategies.

15:26.916 --> 15:29.333
We need to focus on
what we know is inside there.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.625
The gold.

15:31.708 --> 15:33.750
If we figure out how
they plan to get it out,

15:33.833 --> 15:36.250
then they will only be able
to negotiate their surrender.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.375
And to do that,
we will interrogate every hostage!

15:39.750 --> 15:40.916
Not even God gets to go home.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.708
I want to know if they're working.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.625
How are they working? For how long?

15:45.708 --> 15:47.000
When? And especially...

15:49.708 --> 15:51.416
Who are these two?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.666
Because the new members are

15:53.750 --> 15:55.791
the key to the plan.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.458
And most importantly, the reward.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.833
Because they are giving out bills.
We're the state, don't we offer anything?

16:05.416 --> 16:08.791
I want the biggest reward
in the history of the Western world.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.583
Tamayo, what's the cost of a tip
that'd solve this?

16:12.666 --> 16:15.000
I don't know. Three million euros?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.250
Is there a better offer?

16:16.333 --> 16:18.333
-Three million and half.
-The bidding is open!

16:19.125 --> 16:19.958
Martínez.

16:20.416 --> 16:21.916
-Four million?
-Four million?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.125
-Five million!
-Fuck, yes! Antoñanzas?

16:24.208 --> 16:25.041
Six million.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.875
Suárez, can you offer more?

16:29.916 --> 16:31.916
Six million going once, going twice...

16:32.000 --> 16:32.875
Eight!

16:33.708 --> 16:36.541
Eight. They will eat our pussies.

16:36.916 --> 16:40.875
If we round that amount up,
we're talking about ten million euros.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.625
And that amount of money

16:43.708 --> 16:46.958
would convince any Spaniard
to sell their mother.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.875
Ángel? Tell me some good news.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.333
<i>-We have something. They were seen.</i>
-Yes!

16:53.416 --> 16:55.083
A local Civil Guard sounded
a warning bell.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.958
We've narrowed down the area
as much as possible.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.833
The radio signal indicated
they were moving. They're around here.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.958
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Aracena, Huelva.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.625
In a warehouse or something.

17:04.541 --> 17:07.291
There's a van. They've been here, Colonel.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.833
It looks like
they abandoned it in a rush.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.875
Do you think it could be a trap?

17:11.958 --> 17:13.000
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

17:14.916 --> 17:15.833
I'm going inside.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.916
There's nobody here. Wait, wait.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.041
Fuck.

17:37.041 --> 17:40.541
Fuck, Colonel. This is like
a telecommunications headquarters.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.041
There are screens
and radio devices everywhere.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.333
I need the forensic team and a UIT unit.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.958
They had an accident yesterday
and some farmers helped them.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.458
They've confirmed their identity, Colonel.

17:54.541 --> 17:59.083
Good, Ángel. You can count on the army,
the police, and fucking everyone.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.291
The hunt begins.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.208
I have you, asshole. I have you.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.125
Colonel.

18:05.666 --> 18:07.916
Give me a helicopter.
I will lead this hunt.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.583
Let's do it.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.916
Inspector,
they're talking to the Professor.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.625
<i>Rio, I need you to answer me</i>
<i>as precisely as you can.</i>

18:22.500 --> 18:23.958
<i>Where were you held hostage?</i>

18:24.375 --> 18:25.291
In a cell.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.041
A very small one.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.875
As small as a coffin. I couldn't even sit.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.541
<i>I was always on my feet.</i>

18:33.208 --> 18:35.541
-How many days?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

18:36.041 --> 18:37.916
I lost count after four or five days.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.458
There was no natural light there.

18:42.791 --> 18:44.208
Rio, can you keep answering?

18:46.208 --> 18:47.041
Yes.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.583
<i>What did they give you to eat?</i>

18:50.166 --> 18:51.958
<i>Some kind of lumpy paste.</i>

18:52.875 --> 18:54.833
<i>Likely made with flour. And coffee.</i>

18:55.500 --> 18:56.666
<i>A lot of coffee.</i>

18:57.000 --> 18:59.416
Thirty, forty, fifty coffees a day.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.291
I was all hyper.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.416
Sleep deprivation.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.166
Do you think the coffee had
any other substance?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.250
Maybe.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.666
It tasted horrible.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.375
But I was drugged up.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.083
<i>While interrogating me,</i>
<i>they forced me to inhale some gas.</i>

19:15.166 --> 19:16.750
<i>I don't know what the fuck it was.</i>

19:17.166 --> 19:19.375
But then at least,
I could get out of the cell.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.083
And sometimes I could even sit.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.750
Did they allow you
to get out of the cell...

19:26.125 --> 19:28.333
<i>-to do anything else?</i>
-Not even to shit.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.375
They left me there

19:31.791 --> 19:34.250
<i>for hours after I'd pissed</i>
<i>and shit in my pants.</i>

19:35.791 --> 19:36.750
<i>Days.</i>

19:37.375 --> 19:38.333
<i>I don't know.</i>

19:38.416 --> 19:40.125
<i>Did they allow you to wash yourself?</i>

19:42.625 --> 19:44.750
The closest thing was
when they hosed me down.

19:47.958 --> 19:49.041
How was that, Rio?

19:49.916 --> 19:52.500
First, they hang you naked from chains.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.458
Then, they use a pressure hose on you.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.375
"If you want this to be over,

20:00.875 --> 20:02.583
just tell us where the Professor is."

20:04.500 --> 20:06.291
<i>That's what Alicia said constantly.</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:12.333
I swear to you, Professor...

20:14.125 --> 20:16.833
<i>that If I'd known where you were...</i>

20:18.875 --> 20:20.000
I would've talked.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.833
Anyone would have, Rio.

20:27.375 --> 20:28.541
Anyone would have.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.541
<i>You were scared for your life,</i>
<i>weren't you?</i>

20:40.250 --> 20:41.916
I knew we weren't in Spain.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.875
When the wind's direction changed,

20:48.375 --> 20:51.166
<i>I could hear the call to prayer</i>
<i>from a mosque.</i>

20:53.000 --> 20:54.958
I was completely sure...

20:57.333 --> 21:00.291
that they were going to shoot me
and bury me in the desert.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.458
Every day.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.666
I woke up wondering
if that day was my last day.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.375
All that is over, Rio.

21:30.958 --> 21:35.166
Listen. I need you to tell me exactly what
happened when they took you out of there.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.916
They put me on a plane.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.833
And when we landed, they put me in a car.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.583
And they took me to a military hospital.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.125
And how did you sleep there?

21:52.208 --> 21:54.083
I have never slept so well in my life.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.250
They gave me a shot of something amazing.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.375
And I didn't open my eyes
until this morning.

22:00.958 --> 22:02.375
Alicia woke me up.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.875
Well, what?

22:07.041 --> 22:08.541
Where is my red jumper?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.958
If they hand Rio over to us,
they will probably implant a mic on him.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.791
So if we suspect anything, the key words
will be "quick vacation".

22:17.666 --> 22:18.958
<i>Rest a little bit more.</i>

22:19.541 --> 22:21.000
Take a hot bath.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.666
You deserve a quick vacation.

22:31.250 --> 22:34.166
A GPS beacon in a tooth implant.

22:34.250 --> 22:38.458
A mic hidden in the fat tissue,
in the skull, anywhere.

22:38.875 --> 22:40.250
It doesn't matter the cavity,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.666
we will teach you how to extract it.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.166
Any volunteers?

22:50.666 --> 22:53.125
Not me. I can't.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.375
Dopey, you're scared of the scalpel.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.916
No. I have principles.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.541
I'm against animal cruelty.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.458
But you're a soldier. You kill people.
What's the problem? I don't get it.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.083
People are one thing, animals are another.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.375
I love animals.

23:13.958 --> 23:15.791
The animal activist killer.

23:17.833 --> 23:21.583
Can I believe in whatever I want
or are you going to tell me?

23:22.166 --> 23:23.750
About loving animals?

23:24.291 --> 23:26.041
-Yes.
-Well, yes.

23:26.750 --> 23:27.916
I'm going to tell you.

23:28.583 --> 23:32.583
If you really love this pig,
slit it open and take the chip out.

23:32.916 --> 23:35.416
And with all your love, you eat it.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.958
I won't open a pig up.

23:40.916 --> 23:42.833
-I will do the same thing with a doll.
-No, Marseille.

23:42.916 --> 23:45.208
A doll won't work.
We have to open real tissue.

23:45.291 --> 23:49.333
This is the closest thing
there is to a human.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.458
I was in a war.

23:53.541 --> 23:56.125
With a dog at my side.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.916
He was always with me.

23:59.958 --> 24:02.875
People ran away. The dog stayed with me.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.291
Since then, I promised myself...

24:07.291 --> 24:10.208
-I won't open the pig up.
-Open the fucking pig! You're a hitman.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.041
Stay away from me!

24:13.791 --> 24:18.958
Push me again and I will slit
your tissue open from top to bottom.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.583
Marseille.

24:20.666 --> 24:21.666
The scalpel.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.083
-You both, out of the room.
-Me?

24:25.625 --> 24:27.750
It was his fault.
He doesn't want to slit the pig open.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.666
Get out.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.416
-If I go out, I will beat...
-Now!

24:31.041 --> 24:31.875
Very well.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.791
-The fucking pig.
-These guys...

24:35.791 --> 24:37.541
Let's continue. I don't care

24:37.625 --> 24:41.458
who does it, but we have 15 minutes
to locate the chip and start the surgery.

24:43.708 --> 24:47.416
Tokyo, until we do surgery on Rio,
you all need to lead a normal life.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.833
Lead a normal life
while robbing the Bank of Spain?

24:51.416 --> 24:53.208
<i>They can't suspect we know.</i>

24:53.291 --> 24:57.166
You have to talk to Rio about whatever
you need to talk about, unaffectedly.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.166
Talk about how much you have missed
each other and do what feels natural.

25:03.958 --> 25:05.708
Are you suggesting
I should sleep with him?

25:07.875 --> 25:09.541
Because what Rio needs is a hug.

25:10.541 --> 25:11.583
Not a good fuck.

25:12.750 --> 25:16.125
The police know you're a couple
and you haven't seen each other in months.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.500
<i>It's crucial they think they have access</i>

25:18.583 --> 25:20.583
<i>to your privacy,</i>
<i>so they won't suspect anything.</i>

25:23.041 --> 25:23.916
<i>Tokyo.</i>

25:26.458 --> 25:27.333
Tokyo.

25:30.666 --> 25:32.500
They will do what they have to do.

25:58.916 --> 26:02.375
Really? Was that really necessary?

26:02.458 --> 26:05.916
They held that poor boy for two months
without any sleep in a hole,

26:06.041 --> 26:07.666
shitting and pissing on himself.

26:08.041 --> 26:11.000
He thought he was on death row
and now you use him like this?

26:11.083 --> 26:14.458
It's the perfect time to get
a fundamental advantage, Raquel.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.166
Fundamental in this whole war!

26:16.250 --> 26:20.541
To control the mics and beacons
they may have implanted in him.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.750
If they need to fuck, even if they aren't
in the mood for it, they must.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.041
You didn't even realize
Tokyo didn't answer.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.916
You're complaining more than she is.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.375
<i>The problem is that I am here. Isn't it?</i>

26:36.458 --> 26:39.416
And you would rather do this alone.
Like a lone wolf.

26:41.291 --> 26:42.833
So let's be clear for once.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.416
What's happening?

26:44.583 --> 26:47.083
Sergio, look at me. What's happening?

26:48.291 --> 26:51.208
-What's up?
-I feel like I am betraying the gang.

26:52.583 --> 26:53.458
What?

26:54.375 --> 26:55.875
I'm disrespecting...

26:57.083 --> 26:57.916
the robbery.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.291
My brother could mix
a relationship with all this, I can't.

27:02.375 --> 27:05.416
I find it impossible. I can't, Raquel.
I'm a chess player.

27:05.500 --> 27:09.250
Bobby Fischer would've never faced Spassky
with his girlfriend at his side.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.916
I am nobody's girlfriend.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.375
I'm here because I know the police
a lot better than you

27:16.458 --> 27:18.625
and a lot better
than anybody in this gang.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.583
You know about protocols
and negotiations, just like I do.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.625
I beat you at this game, Raquel.

27:30.250 --> 27:31.833
You beat me at this game?

27:37.208 --> 27:38.583
I must be stupid.

27:40.916 --> 27:42.916
I thought we were in love.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.666
Look. My mother and my daughter
are in the Philippines.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.666
The police are looking for them.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.500
I didn't ask you to come.

28:06.541 --> 28:08.583
This is just revenge, isn't it?

28:09.375 --> 28:10.625
Since the Philippines.

28:11.166 --> 28:14.166
Since those nights you woke up
dreaming about your brother.

28:15.416 --> 28:19.708
And Rio is just the perfect excuse
to avenge Berlin. Isn't it?

28:21.083 --> 28:22.458
<i>But do you know what?</i>

28:25.916 --> 28:27.791
You've already fucked up my life.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.083
DON'T SAY ANYTHING

29:18.416 --> 29:21.000
THEY'VE IMPLANTED YOU WITH A MIC

29:25.791 --> 29:28.458
FOLLOW MY LEAD

29:31.125 --> 29:33.125
What color do you think my underwear is?

29:33.625 --> 29:34.625
Burgundy.

29:34.708 --> 29:35.541
<i>Black.</i>

29:36.125 --> 29:37.375
And you don't always wear them.

29:37.708 --> 29:38.541
What?

29:42.166 --> 29:43.125
Bingo.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.583
Antoñanzas, is something going on?

29:49.333 --> 29:50.166
No, sir.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.791
WE'RE GOING TO DO SURGERY ON YOU

30:13.916 --> 30:17.083
<i>Rio and I were always</i>
<i>honest while fucking.</i>

30:18.000 --> 30:20.291
<i>But you don't always want</i>
<i>to hear the truth.</i>

30:20.791 --> 30:21.666
Tokyo...

30:25.875 --> 30:27.125
I can't be with you.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.625
I thought a lot about it...

30:36.666 --> 30:39.125
and I realized I've always followed you

30:39.583 --> 30:40.583
like a lapdog.

30:42.625 --> 30:44.875
<i>In that cell, I learned that I'm strong.</i>

30:45.875 --> 30:47.000
<i>I was afraid before.</i>

30:48.041 --> 30:49.625
<i>I was afraid of a life without you.</i>

30:51.750 --> 30:53.750
On the island, after three days...

30:55.083 --> 30:57.833
<i>I was out of my mind.</i>
<i>It's a shitty feeling.</i>

31:01.583 --> 31:03.083
I don't want to be like that again.

31:03.166 --> 31:04.375
Rio.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.125
Tokyo, you need this.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.875
-No.
-Yes. I'm sorry.

31:07.958 --> 31:11.041
I really am, but I don't want to live
on your roller coaster.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.625
<i>That's how my fall started.</i>

31:16.041 --> 31:18.125
<i>Suddenly, I felt like an oil tanker</i>

31:18.208 --> 31:20.541
<i>that reaches the end of the world</i>
<i>and plunges into the abyss.</i>

31:20.625 --> 31:22.291
<i>And while you fall,</i>

31:22.791 --> 31:24.458
<i>you can only look up</i>

31:25.416 --> 31:28.500
<i>and see how what you loved the most</i>
<i>becomes smaller and smaller.</i>

31:33.416 --> 31:34.708
<i>If I had known</i>

31:34.791 --> 31:36.791
<i>that was going to be our last fuck,</i>

31:36.875 --> 31:38.833
<i>I wouldn't have allowed it</i>
<i>to reach its end.</i>

31:40.208 --> 31:42.083
<i>I haven't loved anyone</i>
<i>like I've loved you.</i>

31:43.750 --> 31:45.791
And that's not much, I'm 22 years old.

31:46.708 --> 31:48.708
<i>But it will still be true when I'm 70.</i>

32:01.125 --> 32:02.750
Rio, don't leave me, please.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.250
Please, don't leave me.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.375
Do you hear me? Don't leave me.

32:08.791 --> 32:09.625
Don't leave me.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.291
You will move on to
someone better than me.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.500
You're very hot.

32:14.708 --> 32:15.916
-And you're rich.
-No.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.708
And in some years, we will meet again.

32:17.791 --> 32:20.666
And I will be with two or three kids
and grocery bags.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.166
And you will be...

32:22.458 --> 32:24.833
in a stunning convertible

32:24.916 --> 32:27.125
with a hot black guy, a Brazilian. Yeah.

32:27.958 --> 32:30.166
And we will drink wine
and laugh about this.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.375
I want to go back to the island with you.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.666
Please, no.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.500
Colonel,
a drone has located the Professor.

32:56.875 --> 32:57.958
-Does it have a signal?
-Yes.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.166
Put it on the screen.

33:00.208 --> 33:03.041
Colonel Tamayo speaking. Do you copy?
Get closer.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.333
EMERGENCY

33:29.708 --> 33:31.083
Yes. Get closer.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.708
Get closer. Closer!

33:47.791 --> 33:49.250
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

33:51.625 --> 33:52.625
No, no.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.916
Shit. Go up, fuck, go up!
I want to see what exit he takes.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.666
Locate the end of that road.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.625
I have to talk to you about
the escape protocol.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.958
Take those stupid pajamas off.

34:54.583 --> 34:58.333
-Yes. I think the protocol can wait.
-No, tell me about it.

34:59.375 --> 35:00.833
Take it as...

35:01.458 --> 35:05.875
some kind of job training under pressure.

35:09.166 --> 35:10.083
Very well.

35:10.708 --> 35:11.625
Point one.

35:12.708 --> 35:13.541
Dispersion.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.541
If we're located,

35:16.625 --> 35:18.625
we'll have twice the opportunities

35:18.708 --> 35:21.625
if we separate, and we have to do that...

35:22.250 --> 35:23.333
very fast.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.666
Raquel.

35:28.833 --> 35:29.916
Be careful.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.875
If they catch you, I'll kill you.

36:10.541 --> 36:12.125
<i>A very good point one.</i>

36:12.500 --> 36:13.750
And point two.

36:14.416 --> 36:15.416
Point two?

36:17.375 --> 36:19.958
I am not hearing point two, Professor.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.541
Point two. In the emergency bags,

36:26.125 --> 36:28.625
we have to bring money,

36:28.875 --> 36:31.041
a camouflage net,

36:31.708 --> 36:33.333
a thermal blanket,

36:33.791 --> 36:35.666
-a gun.
-A gun.

36:35.750 --> 36:38.750
And water to survive at least 72...

36:43.500 --> 36:44.916
Seventy-two hours.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.541
What's the name of point two?

36:47.625 --> 36:49.125
You give everything a name.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.041
Epicenter.

36:55.208 --> 36:57.416
<i>In everyone's mind,</i>

36:57.916 --> 37:03.333
<i>there's a fixed idea,</i>
<i>which is the fugitive runs away.</i>

37:04.083 --> 37:05.541
But we won't run away.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.375
We'll stay there.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.041
We will stay still, whatever happens,

37:11.500 --> 37:14.583
<i>within a 500-meter radius</i>

37:14.666 --> 37:16.875
<i>of wherever we are detected.</i>

37:17.416 --> 37:20.041
-The epicenter.
-The epicenter. Very good.

37:20.125 --> 37:23.208
<i>We will be a few meters away from them,</i>
<i>but they won't see us,</i>

37:23.291 --> 37:27.791
<i>provided that we hide during</i>
<i>the first four minutes.</i>

37:27.875 --> 37:29.541
How are we going to hide?

37:29.625 --> 37:31.708
Seven or eight meters off the ground.

37:31.791 --> 37:32.958
At the top of a tree.

37:35.583 --> 37:39.708
<i>We will use the same hiding technique</i>
<i>as snipers.</i>

37:39.791 --> 37:41.666
A perfect camouflage.

37:41.750 --> 37:42.791
The class is over.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.416
Raquel, you should be in position already.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.125
I know, but I have a problem.

38:08.958 --> 38:09.791
What's wrong?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.250
There are soldiers.
I won't have enough time.

38:15.333 --> 38:16.833
No. Stick to the plan.

38:20.250 --> 38:21.166
<i>Raquel!</i>

38:22.458 --> 38:23.291
There they are!

38:23.375 --> 38:24.291
Get closer.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.083
Shit!

38:46.541 --> 38:48.166
I want the forensic team there!

38:48.250 --> 38:50.083
We've caught them in their undies,
gentlemen.

38:50.166 --> 38:53.041
I'm sure that ambulance
is full of evidence. Come on!

39:30.500 --> 39:34.666
Raquel, I'm two kilometers
to the west of the epicenter.

39:34.750 --> 39:38.250
There are military officers everywhere.
Did you get to the top of the tree?

39:38.333 --> 39:41.041
<i>-No, I had to improvise.</i>
-What?

39:41.125 --> 39:43.625
There's a farm 400 meters south
from your position.

39:43.708 --> 39:45.541
No. That's the first place they'll check.

39:45.625 --> 39:48.666
-I don't have any other option.
-Raquel?

40:06.875 --> 40:09.000
<i>The Ministry of the Interior</i>
<i>has just announced</i>

40:09.083 --> 40:10.958
<i>the biggest reward in history.</i>

40:11.041 --> 40:15.375
<i>Ten million euros for any information</i>
<i>that helps capture the Professor</i>

40:15.458 --> 40:17.125
<i>or dismantle the robbery.</i>

40:17.416 --> 40:21.625
<i>Public support is one</i>
<i>of the police's</i> <i>biggest worries...</i>

40:22.500 --> 40:24.083
Every hostage says...

40:25.875 --> 40:29.500
this guy took some hostages to help him.

40:29.875 --> 40:33.250
He said they were going to work in
more than 65 degrees.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.416
They're melting the gold.

40:37.083 --> 40:38.250
Melting the gold? How?

40:38.958 --> 40:42.250
Fuck, Sierra. What have they set up
in there? A fucking forge?

40:42.416 --> 40:45.416
An industrial oven is smaller
than a dishwasher.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.416
They went into the Bank with army trucks.

40:47.541 --> 40:48.625
Fuck me!

40:50.000 --> 40:52.708
They're melting the national reserve! Why?

40:52.791 --> 40:55.791
To get it out,
it makes the extraction easier.

40:56.166 --> 40:58.166
They can shape it any way they want.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.708
They can pass it through a drain

40:59.791 --> 41:02.750
or get it out in their zeppelins
in the form of gold grains.

41:03.583 --> 41:04.458
I don't know.

41:06.958 --> 41:09.666
Let's go forward with your plan.
We're going after the gold.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.833
They won't even get a grain out!

41:24.500 --> 41:27.291
Gentlemen, they must be around here.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.166
Make the dogs smell the samples
we found in the van.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.583
Look around the whole forest!
Leave no stone unturned!

41:34.416 --> 41:37.291
Every building you find,
search it thoroughly! Okay?

41:37.625 --> 41:38.625
Let's go!

43:55.583 --> 43:58.083
