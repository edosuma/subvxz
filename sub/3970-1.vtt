<i>Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China</i>

00:19.102 --> 00:21.145
<i>than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?</i>

00:21.229 --> 00:23.022
- <i>That can't possibly be true.</i>
- <i>It is.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.148
<i>What would account for that?</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:27.234
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.445
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

00:29.529 --> 00:31.363
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.451
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.994
You got a 1600?

00:37.078 --> 00:38.912
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.205
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.583
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.917
Or you could get into a final club.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.335
Or I get into a final club.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.837
You know, from a woman's perspective,

00:46.921 --> 00:48.797
sometimes not singing in an a 
cappella group is a good thing.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.923
This is serious.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.467
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.427
Well, I can't do that.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.095
I was kidding.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.346
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.223
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.142
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.478
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.521
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.148
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.276
No.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.445
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.988
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

01:13.073 --> 01:14.114
so I assumed you had met one.

01:14.199 --> 01:18.202
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.787
Okay.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.330
Should we get something to eat?

01:21.414 --> 01:23.207
Would you like to talk
about something else?

01:23.500 --> 01:26.710
No. It's just since the beginning 
of the conversation about finals club,

01:26.795 --> 01:28.670
I think I may have missed a birthday.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.633
There are really more people in China 
with genius IQs than the entire population...

01:32.717 --> 01:36.053
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.221
Which one?

01:37.305 --> 01:38.806
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.641
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.061
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

01:44.145 --> 01:45.604
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

01:45.688 --> 01:48.398
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.025
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

01:52.529 --> 01:55.405
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.658
None of them. That's the point.

01:57.742 --> 02:00.661
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

02:00.745 --> 02:02.079
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.123
The ability to make money 
doesn't impress anybody around here.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.459
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.877
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.172
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.340
I think you asked me that

02:13.424 --> 02:15.217
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

02:15.301 --> 02:16.552
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.971
I... What?

02:19.055 --> 02:20.597
You asked me which one 
was the easiest to get into

02:20.682 --> 02:23.183
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.769
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

02:25.854 --> 02:27.020
where anybody has the best chance.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.689
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

02:28.773 --> 02:30.232
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.902
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.363
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.782
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.243
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

02:41.327 --> 02:42.995
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.581
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.375
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

02:49.669 --> 02:52.171
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.090
Yes. There is.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.842
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.177
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.012
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

03:00.096 --> 03:01.930
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.765
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.268
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.936
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

03:08.021 --> 03:09.938
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.274
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.736
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.362
Did you really just say that?

03:17.447 --> 03:18.947
I was kidding.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.699
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

03:20.783 --> 03:21.867
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

03:21.951 --> 03:24.203
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.873
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

03:27.957 --> 03:31.126
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.712
You would do that for me?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.756
We're dating.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.216
Okay.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.469
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

03:40.595 --> 03:42.387
and let you know that we're not anymore.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.973
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.142
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.227
You're breaking up with me?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.561
You're gonna introduce me to people

03:49.646 --> 03:51.313
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

03:51.439 --> 03:53.232
What the... 
What is that supposed to mean?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.566
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.485
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

03:56.611 --> 03:58.320
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

03:59.405 --> 04:03.075
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

04:03.159 --> 04:07.579
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.165
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

04:10.291 --> 04:12.501
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.919
- Is this real?
- Yes.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.004
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.422
- Erica?
- Yes?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.757
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.094
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.428
- I can't.
- Why?

04:23.513 --> 04:26.431
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.684
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

04:28.810 --> 04:29.935
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.187
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

04:32.313 --> 04:33.355
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.773
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.191
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.110
'Cause you go to BU.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.655
Do you want to get some food?

04:42.365 --> 04:45.200
I am sorry you are not sufficiently 
impressed with my education.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.202
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.038
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.206
I was just being polite.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.457
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.626
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

04:54.711 --> 04:57.296
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

04:57.672 --> 05:02.050
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.137
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

05:05.221 --> 05:06.888
because you're a nerd.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.559
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.688
It'll be because you're an asshole.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.788
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

08:18.915 --> 08:21.416
<i>Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,</i>

08:21.542 --> 08:24.753
<i>or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?</i>

08:29.091 --> 08:31.134
<i>For the record, 
she may look like a 34C,</i>

08:31.260 --> 08:33.886
<i>but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

08:33.971 --> 08:38.058
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.</i>

08:42.145 --> 08:43.897
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

08:43.981 --> 08:46.274
<i>I need to do something
to take my mind off her.</i>

08:46.400 --> 08:48.944
<i>Easy enough, except I need an idea.</i>

08:55.117 --> 08:57.244
<i>I'm a little intoxicated, 
I'm not gonna lie.</i>

08:57.328 --> 08:59.246
<i>So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
and it's a Tuesday night?</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:00.372
Billy.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.207
<i>The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,</i>

09:02.291 --> 09:04.960
<i>and some of these people 
have pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:08.630
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had 
the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

09:08.756 --> 09:11.967
<i>next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

09:12.093 --> 09:13.635
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson.</i>

09:20.434 --> 09:23.019
<i>Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

09:23.104 --> 09:24.938
<i>but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.</i>

09:25.022 --> 09:26.523
<i>It gives the whole thing 
a very "Turing" feel</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:28.567
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit</i>

09:28.651 --> 09:31.194
<i>than, say, choosing a number 
to represent each person's hotness,</i>

09:31.320 --> 09:32.988
<i>like they do on hotornot.com.</i>

09:33.114 --> 09:35.615
<i>The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:37.909
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:39.035
<i>so I'm going to have to get 
all the images</i>

09:39.161 --> 09:40.787
<i>from the individual houses
that people are in.</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:43.623
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

09:59.682 --> 10:00.682
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:03.768
<i>They keep everything open and allow indexes 
in their Apache configuration.</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:08.398
<i>So a little wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

10:08.524 --> 10:09.524
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

10:27.043 --> 10:28.043
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

10:28.169 --> 10:30.253
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

10:30.379 --> 10:31.379
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

10:31.505 --> 10:33.840
<i>and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:37.218
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:38.928
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

10:39.388 --> 10:41.473
Excuse me! Everybody!

10:41.557 --> 10:44.976
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.854
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.230
And I want to welcome you all

10:49.357 --> 10:52.734
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

10:59.867 --> 11:02.535
<i>Lowell has some security.
They require a username / password combo,</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:05.789
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

11:05.915 --> 11:07.082
<i>so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.</i>

11:08.250 --> 11:12.003
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

11:12.088 --> 11:15.173
<i>All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

11:16.759 --> 11:18.760
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:20.136
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:22.639
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

11:22.765 --> 11:25.433
<i>Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.</i>

11:25.518 --> 11:26.559
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

11:26.644 --> 11:29.229
<i>and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

11:29.313 --> 11:31.564
<i>And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

11:31.649 --> 11:34.234
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.</i>

11:34.318 --> 11:35.777
<i>This may be difficult. 
I'll come back later.</i>

11:35.861 --> 11:37.654
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.407
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.158
<i>Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,</i>

11:42.284 --> 11:45.370
<i>but you can do an empty search and get links 
to pages with every student's picture.</i>

11:45.454 --> 11:48.123
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:51.084
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

11:51.168 --> 11:54.546
<i>So it's definitely necessary to 
break out Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

12:05.224 --> 12:06.683
Here you go.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.981
<i>Done.</i>

12:13.357 --> 12:15.150
Hey, what's going on?

12:15.234 --> 12:18.903
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

12:18.988 --> 12:20.613
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.699
You and Erica split up.

12:22.825 --> 12:23.867
How did you know that?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.493
It's on your blog.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.121
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.540
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.667
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.003
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.382
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.176
You think this is such a good idea?

12:41.385 --> 12:42.761
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

12:42.845 --> 12:44.679
I need the algorithm.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.349
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.896
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.732
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

12:55.858 --> 12:56.941
based on their current rating, right?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.528
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.030
Let's write it.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.630
One on the left.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.423
The right.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.925
Yeah, still the right.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.843
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

13:23.928 --> 13:24.969
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.139
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.390
The question is,

13:29.642 --> 13:32.060
who are they gonna send it to?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.465
Hey, guys, check this out.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.636
Someone go to the left. 
Dude, do left.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.264
Look at these girls. 
Right or left?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.599
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.394
Right or left?

14:14.478 --> 14:16.271
That's my roommate.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.273
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.359
This is pathetic.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.485
Right.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.778
Left.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.446
- Left.
- Left?

14:26.532 --> 14:27.866
Oh, shit.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.034
Albright.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.495
He blogged about you.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.873
You don't wanna read it.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.003
Left.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.588
Latina.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.881
Erica.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.216
Is this yours?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.759
I stole it from a tranny.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.887
Get the hell out of here!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.556
- Left.
- One on the right.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.141
Left.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.317
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.738
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

15:15.581 --> 15:16.789
Hello?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.919
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

15:21.837 --> 15:22.879
At 4:00 in the morning?

15:22.963 --> 15:26.090
Well, there's a very unusual amount of traffic 
to the switch at Kirkland.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.635
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.804
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.848
All right.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.144
I gotta go in.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.271
What's going on?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.982
Harvard's network is about to crash.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.281
You don't think...

15:52.409 --> 15:53.576
I do.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.496
Go see if it's everybody's.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.419
I can't connect.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.381
The network's down.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.133
Unless it's a coincidence, 
I think this is us.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.677
It's not a coincidence.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.637
Holy shit.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.476
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.228
That's not what happened.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.938
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

16:22.022 --> 16:25.775
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.485
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.237
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.989
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.740
That's really for us to decide.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.369
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.870
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.706
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.459
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot of time 
embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

16:43.544 --> 16:45.378
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.088
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.256
She was under oath.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.717
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.521
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

17:04.940 --> 17:05.982
Thousand.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.233
What?

17:08.359 --> 17:10.194
Twenty-two thousand.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.614
Wow.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.884
These guys are just freakin' fast.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.017
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.852
Jump out and swim.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.480
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.608
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.944
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.112
Just row the damn boat.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.955
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.667
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network 
from a laptop at Kirkland.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.252
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.837
How?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.965
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.884
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

18:14.968 --> 18:16.010
I don't know.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.638
A three-hour low-rate technical row 
before breakfast.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.181
Full course load. Studying.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.558
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.851
I'm not sure how we missed it.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.561
How much activity was there on this thing?

18:25.687 --> 18:27.438
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.357
Twenty-two thousand?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.901
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.654
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.905
Twenty-two thousand?

18:36.490 --> 18:39.408
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.162
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.914
This is our guy.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.916
Cameron Winklevoss.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.211
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.587
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.256
Tyler Winklevoss.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.676
Tyler spelled the usual way, 
and my last name is the same as my brother's.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.471
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.766
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

19:03.851 --> 19:05.268
violating copyrights,

19:05.352 --> 19:10.648
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.526
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

19:13.610 --> 19:15.820
on distribution of digitized images.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.948
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.241
Would you like to do so?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.285
I...

19:23.370 --> 19:27.999
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

19:28.083 --> 19:29.667
to Fuerza Latina,

19:29.751 --> 19:32.086
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.422
as I take it that they were.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.383
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

19:37.467 --> 19:40.344
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.473
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.559
I don't understand.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.685
Which part?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.854
You deserve recognition?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.065
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.151
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.653
Mr. Zuckerberg,

19:57.738 --> 20:00.948
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.451
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

20:03.535 --> 20:07.121
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.831
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

20:08.916 --> 20:09.957
That would be impressive,

20:10.042 --> 20:11.375
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

20:11.460 --> 20:13.252
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.009
So?

20:20.093 --> 20:22.428
Six months academic probation.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.764
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.432
They had my blog.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.309
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.685
That was stupid.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.855
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.358
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.986
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.988
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.574
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.743
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.205
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

20:49.289 --> 20:51.582
and a page size of 256 bytes.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.879
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.591
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

21:01.176 --> 21:04.345
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.306
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.226
The eight status bits would then be...

21:10.310 --> 21:11.602
Anybody?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.314
And I see we have our first surrender.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.691
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.985
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

21:19.069 --> 21:23.864
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.201
That is correct.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.162
Does everybody see how he got there?

21:35.877 --> 21:37.003
Mark?

21:37.879 --> 21:40.047
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.341
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.467
Tyler Winklevoss.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.927
Are you guys related?

21:45.012 --> 21:46.512
- That's good.
- Funny.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.055
We never heard that before.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.433
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.601
No. You didn't. 
Actually, I don't know.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.395
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.521
No.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.565
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.942
You got a minute?

22:00.027 --> 22:03.070
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.697
- We have to.
- Why?

22:04.781 --> 22:06.198
We row crew.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.118
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.125
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.835
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

22:17.919 --> 22:19.003
because you're not a member.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.504
I've heard.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.260
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.012
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.097
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.016
We were really impressed with Facemash.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.685
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.811
I don't know CourseMatch.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.314
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.024
It's really smart, man.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.277
- Mark.
- Yeah.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.154
We were talking about CourseMatch.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.199
It was kind of a no-brainer.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.242
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.746
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.790
Anybody try to buy it?

22:56.416 --> 22:57.458
Microsoft.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.627
Wow. How much?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.796
Didn't sell it. 
Uploaded it for free.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.547
- For free?
- Yeah.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.840
Why?

23:06.718 --> 23:09.261
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

23:09.346 --> 23:10.429
and we think it's great.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.764
It's called the Harvard Connection.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.267
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.645
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

23:17.729 --> 23:20.147
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

23:23.443 --> 23:25.152
Harvard.edu.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.655
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.074
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

23:30.158 --> 23:32.076
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

23:32.160 --> 23:33.911
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.288
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.875
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

23:40.001 --> 23:41.377
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

23:41.503 --> 23:44.213
Is exclusivity. Right?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.090
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.633
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.427
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.137
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

23:51.221 --> 23:54.140
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.684
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.687
Wow. You would do that for me?

24:02.357 --> 24:03.357
We'd like to work with you.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.527
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.196
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.491
We would need you to build the site 
and write the code, and we'll provide all the...

24:12.576 --> 24:13.868
I'm in.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.537
What?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.539
I'm in.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.957
Awesome.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.709
That's what you said?

24:22.544 --> 24:25.087
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.505
When did you come to Eduardo?

24:26.923 --> 24:28.591
I don't understand that question.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.342
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.178
The affirmative?

24:32.262 --> 24:34.221
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.931
It was called The Facebook then.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.559
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.145
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.605
Did you answer affirmatively

24:42.731 --> 24:45.149
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

24:45.233 --> 24:46.817
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.569
Did you say yes?

24:50.238 --> 24:51.447
I said I'd help.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.533
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

24:54.618 --> 24:56.118
I wouldn't say I approached him.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.370
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.873
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.333
What's that?

25:02.417 --> 25:04.376
The Jewish fraternity.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.213
It was Caribbean Night.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.149
It's not that guys like me are 
generally attracted to Asian girls.

25:27.275 --> 25:30.152
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.279
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

25:32.405 --> 25:34.281
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.368
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

25:37.452 --> 25:40.412
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.956
Hey, Mark's here.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.249
Mark!

25:46.419 --> 25:47.962
Be right back.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.554
I think I've come up with something.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.847
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

25:58.974 --> 25:59.974
What?

26:00.100 --> 26:02.351
I got punched by the Phoenix.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.645
- Are you kidding?
- No.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.064
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

26:07.148 --> 26:09.942
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.902
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.153
So...

26:13.655 --> 26:15.656
You got punched by the Phoenix.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.450
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.036
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

26:21.162 --> 26:22.830
What did you wanna talk to me about?

26:22.956 --> 26:24.373
- Mark?
- Yeah.

26:24.499 --> 26:25.499
You said you'd come up with something.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.210
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.587
It's 20 degrees outside.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.839
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

26:31.965 --> 26:34.008
which has absolutely nothing to do 
with the Caribbean.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.146
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.314
Yeah.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.982
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.276
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.402
Yeah.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.155
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.574
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.117
so why not build a website that offers that?

27:00.201 --> 27:03.329
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.205
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.416
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

27:07.542 --> 27:12.921
I'm talking about taking the entire 
social experience of college and putting it online.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.591
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.217
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

27:17.344 --> 27:18.385
Yeah?

27:18.553 --> 27:20.554
"It would be exclusive."

27:21.056 --> 27:23.641
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.601
Like getting punched.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.603
Now, that's good.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.855
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

27:30.398 --> 27:33.108
I told him I thought it sounded great.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.235
It was a great idea.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.362
There was nothing to hack.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.490
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

27:39.574 --> 27:44.370
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.499
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

27:49.125 --> 27:50.417
that was the thing.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.294
It was a big project,

27:52.420 --> 27:55.547
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

27:55.632 --> 27:58.258
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

27:58.343 --> 28:01.011
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

28:01.137 --> 28:04.473
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.684
So that was why.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.394
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.437
We'll split it, 70/30.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.065
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

28:13.149 --> 28:15.401
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.527
<i>And you said?</i>

28:16.611 --> 28:18.237
I said, "Let's do it."

28:18.321 --> 28:20.197
Okay. Did he add anything else?

28:20.615 --> 28:21.657
Yes.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.955
It probably was a diversity thing.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.332
But so what?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.792
Why do you think he said that?

28:31.876 --> 28:34.086
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

28:34.170 --> 28:35.921
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.089
What are you suggesting?

28:37.173 --> 28:39.341
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

28:39.467 --> 28:41.009
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

28:41.136 --> 28:42.803
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

28:42.887 --> 28:44.138
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

28:44.222 --> 28:45.472
Stop typing. 
We're off the record.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.598
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

28:46.683 --> 28:48.267
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.352
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

28:50.478 --> 28:53.647
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.862
I'll let you know how the party is.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.996
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

29:09.164 --> 29:10.497
and a witness in another.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.665
Yes, sir.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.752
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

29:14.836 --> 29:17.337
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

29:17.422 --> 29:19.715
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

29:19.841 --> 29:22.468
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

29:22.552 --> 29:26.472
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.140
He said even his most pathetic friends

29:28.224 --> 29:32.102
knew more about getting people interested 
in a website than these guys.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.104
"These guys," meaning my clients.

29:34.189 --> 29:38.150
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

29:38.234 --> 29:40.652
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.821
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.699
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

29:45.784 --> 29:48.410
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.121
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.665
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

29:53.750 --> 29:55.542
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.795
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

29:59.714 --> 30:02.508
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.634
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

30:03.718 --> 30:04.802
Ty.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.222
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

30:08.306 --> 30:11.767
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.310
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

30:13.394 --> 30:16.063
We are about to find it in evidence.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.982
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.</i>

30:19.067 --> 30:20.984
<i>November 30th, 2003.</i>

30:21.069 --> 30:23.862
<i>"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection.</i>

30:23.947 --> 30:26.490
<i>"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.</i>

30:26.574 --> 30:31.286
<i>"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."</i>

30:31.412 --> 30:35.791
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss. 
December 1st, 2003.</i>

30:35.917 --> 30:39.378
<i>"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got about three of your missed calls.</i>

30:39.462 --> 30:42.297
<i>"I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."</i>

30:42.423 --> 30:44.675
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.</i>

30:44.759 --> 30:46.927
<i>December 10, 2003.</i>

30:47.512 --> 30:50.180
<i>"This week has been pretty busy thus far 
with classes and work,</i>

30:50.265 --> 30:53.392
<i>"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

30:53.476 --> 30:55.602
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

30:55.687 --> 30:59.064
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

30:59.148 --> 31:00.190
Tell him okay,

31:00.275 --> 31:03.026
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.363
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.520
Hey, Mark.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.523
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.108
It's gonna cost a little more money.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.569
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.155
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.368
- Do it.
- I already did.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.832
Hey, guess what?

32:00.543 --> 32:02.169
I made the second cut.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.921
That's good.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.674
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.972
I'll get out of here.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.391
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

32:16.476 --> 32:17.517
and Divya Narendra.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.770
December 15th, 2003.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.230
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

32:22.315 --> 32:25.984
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

32:26.069 --> 32:29.404
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

32:29.489 --> 32:31.615
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.868
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

32:34.994 --> 32:39.581
"won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

32:43.711 --> 32:48.131
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.550
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.470
What are the three lies?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.430
Mr. Dowd.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.641
The three lies. First...

32:57.809 --> 32:58.850
Shit!

32:58.935 --> 33:00.769
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.188
Mr. Saverin.

33:03.272 --> 33:06.817
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

33:06.901 --> 33:09.236
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.862
And three, that is not John Harvard.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.280
Who is it?

33:12.865 --> 33:16.493
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.537
Keep your jacket on.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.961
<i>Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,</i>

33:26.045 --> 33:29.423
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.300
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

33:33.052 --> 33:36.263
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

33:36.347 --> 33:39.141
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

33:40.309 --> 33:44.271
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.482
Not to my knowledge. No.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.905
What in the world is this?

33:55.033 --> 33:59.119
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

33:59.203 --> 34:01.788
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

34:01.998 --> 34:04.499
"to get a site like this to run"?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.418
"We'll speak soon"?

34:08.713 --> 34:11.339
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

34:11.466 --> 34:12.507
Yes, it was.

34:12.592 --> 34:17.094
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

34:17.179 --> 34:19.764
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

34:19.849 --> 34:20.891
That's correct.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.643
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.812
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

34:25.897 --> 34:27.438
Did I use any of your code?

34:27.523 --> 34:29.357
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.650
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

34:31.735 --> 34:32.860
Can I continue with my deposition?

34:32.945 --> 34:36.072
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.783
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

34:39.159 --> 34:41.161
you'd have invented Facebook.

34:41.954 --> 34:44.539
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

34:44.623 --> 34:45.916
No shit.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.002
Let's continue.

34:50.670 --> 34:53.130
February 4, 2004.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.805
Mark.

34:59.889 --> 35:03.767
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.727
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.397
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

35:11.567 --> 35:14.694
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

35:14.821 --> 35:16.071
Dustin.

35:17.532 --> 35:21.284
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

35:25.414 --> 35:26.581
Mark?

35:53.192 --> 35:55.443
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.280
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.531
What?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.669
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.212
It's clean and simple.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.007
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.135
What'd you write?

36:20.386 --> 36:23.180
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."

36:23.306 --> 36:26.183
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

36:26.267 --> 36:29.561
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

36:29.645 --> 36:33.523
And at its center, you know, 
that's what The Facebook is gonna be about.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.817
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

36:35.902 --> 36:36.943
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

36:37.028 --> 36:39.237
- Gonna get laid.
- meet a girl. Yes.

36:39.822 --> 36:40.864
That is really good.

36:40.948 --> 36:41.990
And that was it.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.742
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.952
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.038
And here's the masthead.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.581
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

36:49.665 --> 36:53.043
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.170
You have no idea what that's 
gonna mean to my father.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.588
Sure I do.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.134
So when's it going live?

37:01.719 --> 37:04.137
Right now. 
Get your laptop out.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.890
What? Why do we need my laptop?

37:06.974 --> 37:10.477
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

37:14.023 --> 37:18.068
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.862
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.281
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.699
I haven't gotten in yet.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.827
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.872
- Sure.
- Good.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.166
Give me the mailing list.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.585
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.836
These guys.

37:36.921 --> 37:37.963
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

37:38.047 --> 37:40.173
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

37:40.258 --> 37:41.800
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.677
Yeah, you're right.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.102
The site's live.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.230
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.149
I'm buying.

37:59.568 --> 38:00.735
Mark.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.906
Mark, are you praying?

38:18.337 --> 38:20.880
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

38:21.048 --> 38:23.049
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.175
Good point.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.178
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.351
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.395
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.063
- KC.
- What is it?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.189
I don't know.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.025
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

38:40.109 --> 38:41.818
'cause I can never get enough of that.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.488
No, it's not.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.201
Div!

38:51.787 --> 38:52.954
What?

38:58.669 --> 38:59.711
This isn't mine.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.546
Okay, what is wrong?

39:04.550 --> 39:06.968
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.652
Hey!

39:24.737 --> 39:25.904
Not now!

39:25.988 --> 39:27.072
We need 20 minutes!

39:27.156 --> 39:28.531
Okay.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.869
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.122
Mark Zuckerberg?

39:36.582 --> 39:38.416
He stole our website.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.877
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.593
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

39:48.677 --> 39:51.221
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

39:51.305 --> 39:52.347
"Welcome to The Facebook.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.349
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

39:54.433 --> 39:55.892
"through different social networks.

39:55.976 --> 39:59.145
"You must have a harvard.edu 
address to register."

39:59.230 --> 40:01.689
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.108
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.234
I can read it to you.

40:04.318 --> 40:07.529
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

40:07.613 --> 40:08.655
"He" meaning Mark.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.698
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

40:10.783 --> 40:11.908
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.536
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week.'"

40:14.620 --> 40:15.829
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.997
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.166
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

40:20.251 --> 40:24.003
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.674
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

40:27.800 --> 40:31.010
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 
650 students signed up for it on the first day.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.348
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.935
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

40:39.019 --> 40:40.520
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.522
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.357
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.527
Because you don't have a Harvard...

40:47.695 --> 40:49.946
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.030
I'm sure you're right.

40:51.157 --> 40:54.033
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

40:54.118 --> 40:55.201
Wow.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.703
what he did.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.038
All right, thank you very much. 
And, Dad...

40:59.665 --> 41:00.707
All right, love you, too.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.543
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.627
We know he stole our idea.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.129
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.381
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.885
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

41:11.969 --> 41:13.970
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

41:14.054 --> 41:15.805
which is that getting there first 
is everything.

41:15.890 --> 41:16.890
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

41:17.016 --> 41:20.393
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.812
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.814
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

41:24.899 --> 41:25.899
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.066
What's that gonna do?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.485
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

41:28.569 --> 41:31.738
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

41:31.822 --> 41:32.906
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

41:33.032 --> 41:36.326
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.410
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.913
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.081
How much more information
are you waiting for?

41:42.166 --> 41:45.001
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

41:45.085 --> 41:46.669
we can prove that he looked at the code.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.839
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

41:49.924 --> 41:52.175
- On the home page?
- On every page.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.928
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

41:55.054 --> 41:56.095
Okay, look, we don't know...

41:56.222 --> 41:58.097
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

41:58.224 --> 42:00.099
"would help restore his reputation

42:00.226 --> 42:03.186
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."

42:03.270 --> 42:06.606
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.359
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

42:09.443 --> 42:11.861
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

42:11.946 --> 42:13.446
- What?
- that this is in dispute.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.615
We're not starting 
a knife fight in The Crimson.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.116
And we're not suing anybody.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.535
Why not?

42:19.954 --> 42:22.455
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

42:23.624 --> 42:25.458
He's gonna say it's stupid.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.543
What, who, me?

42:26.627 --> 42:28.127
Say it. Why not?

42:29.547 --> 42:31.714
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

42:31.799 --> 42:36.135
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.722
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

42:39.807 --> 42:42.475
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

42:43.143 --> 42:46.646
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

42:47.398 --> 42:48.815
"A family of means"?

42:48.899 --> 42:50.441
Did you know their father was wealthy?

42:51.735 --> 42:52.986
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.321
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

42:55.447 --> 42:57.407
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.326
Did you know that they came from money?

43:00.452 --> 43:02.328
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

43:02.454 --> 43:04.414
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

43:04.498 --> 43:07.834
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.168
If you say so.

43:09.295 --> 43:13.006
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm 
whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.341
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members

43:15.426 --> 43:17.760
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.095
They pointed that out.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.180
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

43:21.307 --> 43:25.268
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

43:26.937 --> 43:27.937
Yes.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.439
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.942
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

43:33.027 --> 43:34.611
you didn't ask my clients for it.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.196
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

43:37.323 --> 43:40.366
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.952
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

43:43.037 --> 43:44.996
and he was also my best friend.

43:45.831 --> 43:49.459
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.378
I didn't know that. 
Tell me more.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.714
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

43:54.840 --> 43:57.050
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.801
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.887
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

44:01.013 --> 44:03.640
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

44:03.724 --> 44:05.141
It exploded.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.060
Everybody on campus was using it.

44:07.144 --> 44:10.730
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.231
And Mark?

44:12.316 --> 44:16.152
And Mark was the biggest thing on a campus 
that included 19 Nobel laureates,

44:16.236 --> 44:20.740
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.492
Who was the movie star?

44:22.576 --> 44:24.160
Does it matter?

44:24.536 --> 44:25.578
No.

44:27.873 --> 44:31.626
<i>...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine</i>

44:31.752 --> 44:33.920
<i>with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.</i>

44:34.046 --> 44:36.547
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.675
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

44:38.759 --> 44:42.637
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

44:42.763 --> 44:45.890
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

44:46.475 --> 44:49.352
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.729
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

44:51.814 --> 44:56.067
That kit computer on the cover 
of that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

44:56.151 --> 45:00.279
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

45:00.823 --> 45:04.784
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

45:04.910 --> 45:09.789
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.959
Your friend. 
Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

45:13.293 --> 45:14.335
Yeah.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.629
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.298
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

45:19.425 --> 45:21.259
Yeah, we... Yes.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.510
Cool.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.262
I'm Christy Ling. 
This is Alice.

45:24.346 --> 45:25.388
Hi.

45:25.472 --> 45:27.682
Well, very nice to meet you.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.517
Facebook me when you get home.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.144
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

45:31.979 --> 45:32.979
Certainly.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.981
Absolutely do that.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.949
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

45:45.033 --> 45:46.576
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.370
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

45:49.496 --> 45:50.496
They wanna have drinks later.

45:50.622 --> 45:52.206
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

45:52.332 --> 45:53.833
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

45:53.959 --> 45:55.626
Excuse me, Mark?

45:56.170 --> 45:57.253
Yeah?

45:57.337 --> 45:59.172
I'm Stuart Singer. 
I'm in your OS lab.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.882
Sure.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.217
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

46:03.343 --> 46:04.343
Thanks.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.262
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

46:06.346 --> 46:07.764
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

46:07.848 --> 46:11.058
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.643
I doubt it.

46:12.728 --> 46:15.271
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.191
It was Bill Gates.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.444
Shit, that makes sense.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.363
All right. Thanks, guys.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.576
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

46:28.702 --> 46:30.369
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

46:30.454 --> 46:32.288
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

46:32.372 --> 46:34.749
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

46:36.376 --> 46:37.960
It's time to monetize the thing.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.337
What were their names?

46:39.421 --> 46:41.214
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

46:41.298 --> 46:43.382
I said it's time to monetize the site.

46:44.384 --> 46:45.384
What does that mean?

46:45.469 --> 46:48.304
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.723
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.726
- Advertising.
- No.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.270
Well, we got 4,000 members.

46:56.396 --> 46:57.522
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

46:57.606 --> 47:00.817
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.527
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

47:02.611 --> 47:05.071
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

47:05.155 --> 47:08.366
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

47:08.450 --> 47:10.910
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.328
We know that it is cool.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.622
That is a priceless asset 
I'm not giving up.

47:14.748 --> 47:16.916
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.709
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

47:18.794 --> 47:21.087
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

47:21.171 --> 47:22.630
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

47:22.756 --> 47:25.299
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

47:25.425 --> 47:28.761
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.514
Mark, what is this?

47:31.598 --> 47:33.057
- What?
- This.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.434
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

47:35.519 --> 47:36.561
- Who?
- The girls.

47:36.645 --> 47:37.812
When did you get this?

47:37.938 --> 47:40.022
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.941
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

47:42.025 --> 47:45.152
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.613
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.950
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.243
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

47:52.327 --> 47:53.828
It was addressed to me.

47:53.954 --> 47:57.039
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.166
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

47:59.293 --> 48:00.293
Did we what?

48:00.377 --> 48:01.961
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.297
The letter says we could face legal action.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.048
No, it says I could face legal action.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.384
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

48:08.468 --> 48:11.596
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.097
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

48:13.181 --> 48:14.599
and Harvard Connection is lame.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.934
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.060
I didn't use anything.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.979
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

48:20.063 --> 48:21.689
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

48:21.815 --> 48:23.608
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

48:23.692 --> 48:26.402
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

48:28.739 --> 48:29.906
Okay.

48:31.199 --> 48:36.829
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.540
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

48:39.625 --> 48:43.085
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

48:43.545 --> 48:44.629
No.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.467
What are we doing about this?

48:49.551 --> 48:52.970
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

48:53.055 --> 48:54.221
And what did you say?

48:54.306 --> 48:57.433
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.894
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

48:59.978 --> 49:01.395
"that I had not anticipated."

49:01.480 --> 49:03.731
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

49:03.815 --> 49:07.068
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

49:07.152 --> 49:10.738
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

49:10.822 --> 49:12.448
I'd raised concerns before.

49:12.532 --> 49:13.783
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

49:13.867 --> 49:17.912
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

49:17.996 --> 49:19.038
Yeah.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.998
Let me rephrase this.

49:21.291 --> 49:25.753
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

49:25.837 --> 49:26.921
Is that a question?

49:27.005 --> 49:30.549
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

49:30.634 --> 49:33.386
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.555
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

49:36.640 --> 49:38.516
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

49:38.600 --> 49:39.850
It just started raining.

49:39.935 --> 49:43.020
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

49:43.855 --> 49:44.939
No.

49:46.024 --> 49:47.400
Do you think I deserve it?

49:47.693 --> 49:48.734
What?

49:48.819 --> 49:51.779
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.365
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

49:54.449 --> 49:57.576
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.455
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

50:01.540 --> 50:04.583
I think if your clients wanna sit on my shoulders 
and call themselves tall,

50:04.668 --> 50:05.793
they have a right to give it a try,

50:05.877 --> 50:09.213
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.717
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

50:13.552 --> 50:16.012
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

50:16.096 --> 50:18.389
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

50:18.473 --> 50:20.057
including and especially your clients,

50:20.142 --> 50:23.477
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

50:24.354 --> 50:27.273
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

50:34.364 --> 50:37.950
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

50:39.745 --> 50:41.245
Back at 2:30.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.206
So what were their names?

50:45.792 --> 50:48.002
Their names were Christy and Alice,

50:50.464 --> 50:53.090
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

50:55.302 --> 50:58.596
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

51:02.642 --> 51:03.809
Wow.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.241
Oh, my God.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.660
I don't care.

51:43.642 --> 51:44.850
Hey, man, sorry.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.853
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

51:49.022 --> 51:50.272
Sweet.

51:54.694 --> 51:56.403
We have groupies.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.205
I'll be right back.

52:06.289 --> 52:08.082
Mark, where you going? Mark.

52:13.338 --> 52:14.380
Erica?

52:16.299 --> 52:17.341
Hi.

52:17.425 --> 52:20.052
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.846
- First time.
- Mine, too.

52:22.514 --> 52:23.806
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

52:25.058 --> 52:26.267
I think I'm good right here.

52:26.351 --> 52:30.396
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.730
Right here is fine.

52:32.482 --> 52:34.525
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

52:34.609 --> 52:35.693
No.

52:36.528 --> 52:39.280
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

52:39.364 --> 52:41.198
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.284
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

52:43.368 --> 52:44.994
Comparing women to farm animals.

52:45.495 --> 52:46.954
I didn't end up doing that.

52:47.038 --> 52:48.706
It didn't stop you from writing it.

52:48.790 --> 52:51.375
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

52:51.459 --> 52:53.752
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.882
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

52:57.966 --> 53:00.885
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

53:00.969 --> 53:05.347
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

53:05.432 --> 53:07.266
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.477
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

53:11.646 --> 53:13.689
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

53:13.773 --> 53:16.567
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

53:17.527 --> 53:19.612
I was nice to you. 
Don't torture me for it.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.655
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

53:21.740 --> 53:23.949
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.452
Okay.

53:28.246 --> 53:30.623
Good luck with your video game.

53:30.707 --> 53:32.625
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

53:32.709 --> 53:34.627
You apologized, right?

53:37.422 --> 53:38.631
We have to expand.

53:38.715 --> 53:40.132
Sure. Mark?

53:42.594 --> 53:44.053
Is he mad about something?

53:45.138 --> 53:47.306
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.099
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.976
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

53:51.061 --> 53:53.270
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

53:53.355 --> 53:54.396
It's The Bridge.

53:54.481 --> 53:55.731
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

53:55.815 --> 53:57.733
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

53:57.817 --> 54:00.236
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.029
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

54:02.113 --> 54:03.322
Because I do. 
Now here's the arrangement.

54:03.406 --> 54:05.407
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.034
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

54:07.118 --> 54:09.703
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

54:09.788 --> 54:11.080
Chris is director of publicity,

54:11.164 --> 54:13.540
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

54:13.625 --> 54:14.667
Any questions?

54:14.751 --> 54:18.337
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

54:18.546 --> 54:19.713
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.215
- Hello.
- Hi.

54:21.716 --> 54:23.133
Is there anything we can do?

54:23.218 --> 54:24.301
No, that's it.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.720
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.431
- What?
- Stanford.

54:29.516 --> 54:31.725
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

54:37.607 --> 54:38.941
You don't want any lunch?

54:39.025 --> 54:40.109
No.

54:40.527 --> 54:42.194
You're welcome to some salad.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.821
No, thank you.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.161
This must be hard.

54:52.706 --> 54:53.747
Who are you?

54:54.291 --> 54:56.834
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

54:56.918 --> 54:58.294
I mean, what do you do?

54:58.378 --> 55:00.504
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

55:00.588 --> 55:03.173
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

55:04.801 --> 55:05.968
What are you doing?

55:06.052 --> 55:09.054
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

55:09.139 --> 55:10.389
Bosnia.

55:10.598 --> 55:13.684
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

55:18.606 --> 55:21.358
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

55:22.193 --> 55:23.444
I don't hate anybody.

55:24.696 --> 55:27.948
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

55:28.033 --> 55:30.576
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

55:30.660 --> 55:33.078
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

55:40.545 --> 55:42.212
He's expanding.

55:42.380 --> 55:43.464
What?

55:43.548 --> 55:44.965
He's expanding to Yale, 
Columbia and Stanford.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.216
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.343
- Really?
- Yep.

55:47.469 --> 55:50.679
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

55:50.764 --> 55:54.058
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief 
and get the site taken down now.

55:54.142 --> 55:57.102
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

55:57.187 --> 55:59.980
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.106
And I want him dead.

56:01.191 --> 56:02.274
Yeah, I want those things, too.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.650
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

56:03.735 --> 56:05.027
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

56:05.111 --> 56:06.820
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

56:06.905 --> 56:07.946
How's it gonna look?

56:08.031 --> 56:09.239
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

56:09.324 --> 56:11.575
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

56:11.701 --> 56:15.287
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.206
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

56:17.290 --> 56:18.624
he'll have violated federal law.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.501
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.503
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

56:22.587 --> 56:25.089
Wait. Yeah, there is.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.512
Harvard Student Handbook.

56:31.596 --> 56:34.390
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

56:34.474 --> 56:35.891
You can't steal from another student.

56:37.852 --> 56:39.603
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.563
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.482
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

56:43.566 --> 56:46.777
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

56:46.861 --> 56:49.321
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

56:49.406 --> 56:52.866
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.451
Why Stanford?

56:54.577 --> 56:56.328
Why do you think?

57:00.583 --> 57:01.959
I'm sorry.

57:02.168 --> 57:03.627
I'm late for biochem.

57:05.296 --> 57:06.338
Okay.

57:09.134 --> 57:10.426
You don't know my name, do you?

57:11.136 --> 57:12.261
Is it Stanford?

57:12.846 --> 57:14.930
I should just kick your ass.

57:15.014 --> 57:17.182
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

57:17.308 --> 57:20.519
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

57:20.603 --> 57:23.772
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

57:24.190 --> 57:25.441
What's my major?

57:25.942 --> 57:27.526
- Trombone.
- Really?

57:28.153 --> 57:30.028
I remember something about a trombone.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.117
French.

57:35.201 --> 57:36.285
Your major's French.

57:36.369 --> 57:38.036
- And yours?
- Mine?

57:38.163 --> 57:40.330
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

57:41.541 --> 57:42.791
I don't go to school.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.710
- You're kidding.
- No.

57:45.044 --> 57:47.045
Well, where did you go to school?

57:47.130 --> 57:49.465
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

57:49.549 --> 57:50.632
Seriously?

57:51.301 --> 57:53.635
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

57:54.220 --> 57:55.387
No.

57:56.055 --> 57:57.139
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

57:57.223 --> 57:58.348
No.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.560
So, what do you do?

58:02.729 --> 58:04.313
I'm an entrepreneur.

58:04.397 --> 58:06.899
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.066
What would you say?

58:08.193 --> 58:09.318
That I'm an entrepreneur.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.069
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

58:11.196 --> 58:15.824
Well, I founded an Internet company that 
let folks download and share music for free.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.242
Kind of like Napster?

58:17.327 --> 58:18.744
Exactly like Napster.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.496
What do you mean?

58:20.580 --> 58:21.914
I founded Napster.

58:21.998 --> 58:23.999
Sean Parker founded Napster.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.417
Nice to meet you.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.336
You're Sean Parker?

58:27.504 --> 58:29.254
You see, the shoe's on the other...

58:29.380 --> 58:31.423
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

58:32.717 --> 58:34.259
I just slept with Sean Parker?

58:34.344 --> 58:36.053
You just slept on Sean Parker.

58:36.429 --> 58:38.680
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

58:38.765 --> 58:40.265
What are you?

58:40.934 --> 58:42.601
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

58:42.685 --> 58:46.021
even less when you're being sued 
by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

58:46.105 --> 58:47.606
This is blowing my mind.

58:47.690 --> 58:48.690
I appreciate that.

58:48.775 --> 58:50.609
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

58:50.735 --> 58:54.112
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

58:54.614 --> 58:55.864
You passed.

58:56.241 --> 58:57.282
I'm a hard worker.

58:58.868 --> 59:02.621
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

59:02.747 --> 59:03.789
You mind if I check my e-mail?

59:04.374 --> 59:05.958
Yeah, go ahead.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.135
Amy!

59:19.305 --> 59:20.472
Jesus.

59:20.598 --> 59:22.891
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

59:23.768 --> 59:25.269
Just a second.

59:28.273 --> 59:29.731
There's a snake in here, Amy.

59:29.816 --> 59:30.899
What?

59:33.319 --> 59:34.403
Where?

59:34.487 --> 59:35.904
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.990
Are you kidding me? 
I could've been killed.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.241
How?

59:39.325 --> 59:43.078
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.830
What do you need to ask me?

59:44.956 --> 59:47.749
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

59:48.626 --> 59:52.087
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

59:52.171 --> 59:54.339
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

59:54.465 --> 59:57.426
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

59:57.635 --> 01:00:00.762
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.181
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.766
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.351
Yeah, is everything okay?

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:08.270
Everything's great.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:13.275
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:18.780
I've never been in this building before.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:23.201
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:26.204
We're sitting in chairs.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.165
Yes.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.376
Very good. You can go in now.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.634
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.302
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

01:00:40.386 --> 01:00:43.221
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.223
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.225
Students. Undergrads.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.810
I don't know.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.647
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:52.981
All right, bye-bye.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:54.900
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.902
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.071
And you're here because...

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:01.573
Either of you can answer.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.158
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:04.326
I've read the letter.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.663
Well, we came up with an idea 
for a website called Harvard Connection...

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:10.916
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:12.417
I understand.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:15.003
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:19.007
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.426
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:25.180
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:27.683
in their dealings with members
in this community.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.268
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:32.771
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.356
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.274
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:43.198
or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.283
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.452
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:50.956
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:54.209
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:55.544
And you've spoken to your House Master?

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.963
Yes, sir. And the House Master 
made a recommendation to the Ad Board,

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.631
but the Ad Board won't see us.

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.550
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.469
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:05.637
for the last two weeks.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:07.556
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.474
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.893
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.061
You chased him?

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.731
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:19.901
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.404
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:25.949
You enter into a code of ethics 
with the university, not with each other.

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:29.995
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what 
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.246
I'm devastated by that.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.999
What my brother means is, 
if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.251
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:38.670
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.088
This isn't petty larceny.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.340
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.592
- Millions?
- Yes.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:46.261
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:49.181
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:53.518
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:54.936
Letting our imaginations run away with us

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.938
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.025
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.443
run away with you on a new project.

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:02.694
You would?

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.196
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:08.950
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:12.788
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.957
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.793
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.377
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.296
And you're saying that I don't?

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.381
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.175
- Really?
- Sir.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:27.302
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:29.304
Colleagues of their father.

01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:33.141
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.644
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:39.981
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:43.568
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.071
You don't get special treatment.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.657
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

01:03:48.741 --> 01:03:50.575
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:52.160
If you have a problem with that, 
Mr. Winklevoss...

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.328
We never asked for special treatment.

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:57.082
the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.834
You can take the Harvard 
Student Handbook and shove it...

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.001
Ty.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.879
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.386
Whoops.

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:12.097
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:16.852
<i>Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.</i>

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.521
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:23.275
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:25.110
Who paid for the trip?

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:28.280
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:32.200
At this point, your $1,000 was the only money 
that had been put into the company?

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:34.286
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:37.873
- They went terribly.
- Why?

01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:39.207
Mark was asleep.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.709
I was not asleep.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.127
Can I rephrase my answer?

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.296
I wish he'd been asleep.

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:50.594
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:52.554
People who go on The Facebook

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:55.056
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.892
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.978
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:01.938
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:04.399
What sound is he making? 
Is that like a tsk?

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.070
It wasn't a tsk.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.572
It was...

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:13.325
Like a glottal stop.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.660
Almost a gag reflex.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.997
Guys, what is this?

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.750
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.168
Yes, it was a dinner.

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.669
It was set up through my girlfriend 
at the time.

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:27.839
Would you say that Mark 
was excited about this meeting?

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.175
Yes. Very.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:32.260
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:34.179
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:37.098
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.100
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.936
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.021
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.272
It isn't a business yet.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:48.151
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:52.530
He's 25 minutes late.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.367
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.118
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.703
He's 25 minutes late.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.038
I think Wardo's jealous.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.333
I honestly wasn't jealous. 
I was nervous.

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:04.542
Why?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:08.129
Well, I didn't know him at all, 
but I had done a search and I'd asked around.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:11.508
And he struck me as kind of a...

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.844
A wild card.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:16.054
Why?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.474
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:20.976
he's had a reputation with drugs...

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.310
He also founded the companies.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:23.728
We don't need him.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:25.397
He's here.

01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:30.151
No, no, take your time.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.988
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:36.074
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:39.077
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:41.162
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.747
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:43.915
- No.
- Tori.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
We were waiting.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.252
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:50.171
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.090
And the lobster claws, 
that'll get us started.

01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:54.092
Christy, what do you like to drink?

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.928
An appletini.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.055
Great. Four of those.

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:02.434
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:13.945
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.709
He took us through his episode with Napster.

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:30.795
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:33.965
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.302
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:41.890
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.060
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.812
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.647
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.941
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.653
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:57.739
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.743
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:04.746
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.999
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.335
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:13.296
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.924
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:18.093
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:20.511
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:23.180
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:25.850
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.770
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.020
they'll make shit up.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:32.689
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:34.526
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:36.027
Excuse me.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.529
Wipe your chin and walk away.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:38.696
That's what happened to you?

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.365
And delusional.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:44.118
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.787
I brought down the record companies with Napster

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:47.205
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.791
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.209
They won.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.044
- In court.
- Yeah.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.964
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.803
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:05.890
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:10.895
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.149
And then he got around to The Facebook.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.734
So, tell me about your progress.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.404
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.240
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.325
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.243
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:27.912
So instead of going right after them,

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:30.081
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:31.249
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:34.169
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids 
saw their friends on our site and we were in.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:35.587
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.087
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.923
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:40.925
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.926
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.261
Well...

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.180
Neither of you yet.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.600
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:49.767
Yeah.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.519
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.687
Exactly.

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.272
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.607
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:56.774
That's exactly right.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.027
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:02.822
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.824
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:05.950
You?

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.079
"A billion dollars."

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.293
And that shut everybody up.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:18.463
<i>And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.</i>

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.883
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.801
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:28.014
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:31.392
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:33.311
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.479
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.940
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.066
Have you seen the big ones up close?

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.110
No, but I don't think the guy's 
holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:43.821
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.448
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:49.827
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.746
He owned Mark after that dinner.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.041
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:56.209
and he was gone.

01:10:56.293 --> 01:11:00.171
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:05.009
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:07.136
It's cleaner.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.099
Shit.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:14.852
Goodbye, sweetie.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.105
Yeah.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.903
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.155
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:30.368
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:32.662
So, what do you think?

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:34.706
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.917
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.294
Doesn't that sound good?

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.087
If you're a trout.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:42.714
I'm going to enter this into the record.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:46.718
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.886
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.556
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:55.393
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:58.604
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:11:59.772
Yeah, we stipulate.

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:02.734
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.444
You have anything here?

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:05.820
Yes. Thank you.

01:12:05.904 --> 01:12:08.614
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:11.284
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.162
No.

01:12:14.246 --> 01:12:18.791
You never did anything to embarrass the company 
or even seriously jeopardize it?

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:20.793
- No.
- No?

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:25.423
No.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.675
You were accused of animal cruelty.

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:31.721
- Wait.
- You weren't?

01:12:31.805 --> 01:12:34.057
This is not happening.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:36.476
I have here an article from The Crimson...

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.643
Jesus Christ.

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:38.770
I can't have this, Wardo.

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:42.315
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.110
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.821
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:52.909
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

01:12:52.993 --> 01:12:55.620
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.080
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.123
I'm not the expert, 
but being connected to torturing animals

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.541
is probably bad for business.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:05.463
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:09.384
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.260
- This is scathing.
- 956.

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:14.180
I was having dinner in the 
Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:15.973
and I had the chicken with me,

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.059
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:19.227
This was college.

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:21.396
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:24.023
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.526
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.821
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.073
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

01:13:32.157 --> 01:13:33.866
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.328
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.747
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.041
I dealt with the associate dean of the college.

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:44.001
This was all resolved.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.128
988.

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:47.255
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:49.173
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.967
All right, let's just forget about it.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:54.011
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.555
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:57.265
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

01:13:57.349 --> 01:14:00.726
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.228
What is happening on that?

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:04.397
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:05.731
and I haven't been to class.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:07.066
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.776
That's a Facebook page?

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:09.902
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.404
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:14.490
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.993
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:19.871
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.707
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.960
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:27.920
Oops.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:32.216
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.926
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.762
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:39.557
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.060
Oops.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.521
993. We are so close.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:49.317
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:51.444
Yeah, no, I agree. 
More servers, more help.

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.279
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:54.447
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:56.491
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:58.326
on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus.

01:14:58.410 --> 01:14:59.744
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.829
When did you decide 
to go to California for the summer?

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.164
You mean when did I actually decide?

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:06.417
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:09.045
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:10.546
What, you're Jed Clampett?

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:12.673
I didn't know you guys got 
The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.425
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.845
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.972
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:23.643
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:25.645
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:28.314
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:30.608
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.151
Hit "Refresh."

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.988
150,004.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:38.449
150,000 members, Wardo.

01:15:38.825 --> 01:15:40.159
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:44.705
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.457
Who came up with nothing.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.501
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:50.711
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.338
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:56.092
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

01:15:58.595 --> 01:15:59.637
What's he talking about?

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:02.390
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:03.641
Get on board with this, man.

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:06.269
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:32.003
You can do one more! One more!

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:37.758
Wardo!

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.135
Yo! Mark!

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:42.096
What's going on?

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.557
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:45.933
expose its SSL encryption,

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.643
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.811
They're hacking.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.938
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.857
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.066
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.068
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:59.155
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:01.073
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.867
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.785
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.871
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:09.081
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.626
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:15.338
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:16.464
You're right.

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:19.842
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.554
- That was mean.
- Here.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:24.764
What is this?

01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:27.933
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:31.270
Will that get you through the summer?

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:32.396
- Here!
- Mark?

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:33.898
Right here!

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.905
Welcome to Facebook.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:51.999
- $18,000?
- Yes.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.418
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.088
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.422
- Yes.
- Hang on.

01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:02.051
I'm just checking your math on that.

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.470
Yes, I got the same thing.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.138
May I continue?

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:09.642
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:11.769
and moving it to California for the summer,

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:14.855
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.693
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:21.862
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.407
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:29.036
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.623
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.838
- I didn't die.
- I know.

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:40.756
- I made it.
- You did.

01:18:42.175 --> 01:18:43.509
Okay, ready?

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:45.845
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:48.305
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.023
I'm okay.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:18:59.358
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.068
Yikes.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.821
That's the doorbell.

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:05.114
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

01:19:05.198 --> 01:19:07.908
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.994
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.164
- Andrew.
- Not now.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:14.582
Good boy.

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.045
- Sean?
- Mark?

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.089
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

01:19:22.382 --> 01:19:23.424
Do you?

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:25.050
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:27.720
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:30.306
I'm Sharon.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.725
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.143
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:36.187
We had a zip line to the pool.

01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:39.523
You came to California.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.025
Yeah.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.235
You made the right choice.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.201
Here you go.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:55.915
Sharon?

01:19:58.376 --> 01:19:59.376
I'm so sorry.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.503
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:02.630
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:08.093
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:10.221
I'm Sean Parker.

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.430
Oh, he's wired in.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.641
That's what I'm talking about.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:16.352
Where's Eduardo?

01:20:16.436 --> 01:20:18.938
He got an internship in New York.

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:20.981
Eduardo didn't come out?

01:20:41.586 --> 01:20:44.296
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:47.842
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:51.387
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:53.931
What's your plan for the summer?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.308
Mark?

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.103
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:01.772
I asked what your plan for the...

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.357
A hundred schools by the end of the summer.

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:05.192
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

01:21:05.318 --> 01:21:07.319
Yeah, I'll go with you.

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:12.449
Your date looks so familiar to me.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.118
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.452
What do you mean?

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:20.833
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.752
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.671
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:28.090
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:32.177
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:35.264
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:38.058
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:41.979
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:45.316
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:46.650
Happy ending, right?

01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:51.447
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:54.825
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:00.831
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.417
Was that a parable?

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:08.422
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:09.965
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.300
I read your blog.

01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:13.427
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

01:22:13.511 --> 01:22:15.179
You know why I started Napster?

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:21.143
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:23.270
and I wanted to take her from him.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.272
So I decided to come up 
with the next big thing.

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:28.233
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.779
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:36.116
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.661
And isn't that what 
your Facemash was about?

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:41.413
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

01:22:41.539 --> 01:22:43.290
What the VCs want is to say,

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.210
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.921
But not this time. 
This is our time.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.841
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.635
"I'm CEO, bitch."

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:57.721
That's what I want for you.

01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:00.057
So where the hell is Eduardo?

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:03.686
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.729
- He's got an...
- An internship.

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:10.401
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.362
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

01:23:13.446 --> 01:23:14.571
I know you do.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.741
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.577
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.749
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.753
And the water under the Golden Gate 
is freezing cold.

01:23:31.464 --> 01:23:35.592
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:38.846
Do you ever think about that girl?

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:39.972
What girl?

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:43.434
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:45.769
No.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:49.398
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:50.983
A hundred schools by the end of the summer?

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:52.109
Yeah.

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.569
Tell you what. 
Gesture of good faith.

01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:58.115
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.367
Two...

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.290
If you don't have a place to crash,

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.667
I think you should definitely come 
and live with us.

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:11.545
Let's line up some shots.

01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:13.756
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.967
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.969
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.155
Attention... Go!

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:59.510
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is 
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:10.521
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:13.732
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.205
Come on!

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.203
Whatever.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:14.918
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:16.879
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:19.214
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.340
Sir?

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.134
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.011
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:27.431
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:28.557
Yes, Your Highness.

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:31.685
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:35.230
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.232
Have you? 
Have you seen a race that close?

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:38.400
No, Your Highness.

01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:40.861
Mile-and-a-half races are more commonly won 
by a boat length or two.

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:43.739
Yes, that's absolutely right. 
Brutally close.

01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:44.990
May I introduce my teammates?

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:47.034
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:48.785
On to the Dutch.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.665
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:55.918
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:58.629
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:02.257
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:04.009
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:05.135
Relax, it's fine.

01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:06.428
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:08.555
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.724
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:12.643
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.646
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:17.606
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:20.943
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:22.778
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:24.279
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:27.324
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:29.701
which they've just seen via their computers.

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:33.664
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:37.167
I'm gonna find your mother.

01:27:38.711 --> 01:27:39.753
Have I said something wrong?

01:27:39.837 --> 01:27:41.713
Your daughter doesn't go to school 
in the States?

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:43.131
No, no. Cambridge.

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.968
Majoring in French literature, 
though I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.135
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.304
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:50.472
That's where her friends are.

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.557
That's awesome.

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:56.520
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.232
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

01:28:03.569 --> 01:28:05.862
If this is online, I wanna see it.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.322
Stop it.

01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:09.366
Stop it, Cam.

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:11.243
Knock it off.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:14.371
I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today 
by less than a second.

01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:16.665
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.208
And they'll see us again.

01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:20.460
What I mind, and what you should mind,

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:23.714
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:26.174
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:29.845
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

01:28:29.929 --> 01:28:32.431
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:37.728
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

01:28:38.187 --> 01:28:39.438
Come on.

01:28:40.857 --> 01:28:42.691
I need a real drink.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:50.574
Screw it.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.244
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.415
That's what I'm talking about!

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.417
No, no, no, no, no.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.836
But check it out, I saw him today.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.339
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:06.506
Hang on.

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:08.258
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.010
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:11.511
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:13.722
Like we know what that is.

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:18.018
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:19.686
I know he did.

01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:25.067
Don't. Don't sweat it. 
I'm on a landline.

01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:26.568
Bong hit.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:28.779
Does anybody hear that banging?

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:31.281
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.367
Dude, somebody's at the door.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:38.038
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.585
I'm gonna call you back.

01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:48.090
What's up?

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.551
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.220
I've been calling his cell.

01:29:53.304 --> 01:29:57.808
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:05.148
What happened here?

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:08.735
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:09.986
Wardo.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.071
Hey, man.

01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:13.156
- Back to work.
- Okay.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:16.159
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:17.786
I mean the more wasted that I get...

01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:19.579
We understand.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.083
How old are they, Sean?

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.001
It's not polite to ask.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.253
Sean, how old are they?

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:28.839
You think you know me, right?

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:30.173
I've read enough.

01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:32.634
You know how much I've read about you?

01:30:33.177 --> 01:30:34.511
Nothing.

01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:40.100
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

01:30:40.184 --> 01:30:43.103
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:46.523
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:50.277
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:51.445
I'm just calling it the Wall.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:54.114
Forget the Wall, tell him 
about the meeting I've got set up.

01:30:54.198 --> 01:30:55.782
You know Peter Thiel?

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.200
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.537
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

01:31:02.039 --> 01:31:03.623
Why's he setting up meetings?

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:04.791
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:07.961
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

01:31:08.045 --> 01:31:10.714
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:13.049
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:15.051
and in between there was a long flight.

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:16.887
I'm the business end of this company.

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:20.056
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:23.059
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:26.480
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:28.231
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:31.526
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:42.996
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:48.668
Bong hit.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:51.046
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:53.340
So how's it going?

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.343
How's the internship? 
How's Christy?

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.679
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:03.183
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:05.769
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:09.773
I do remember you saying that.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.733
So how is Christy?

01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:13.777
Christy's crazy.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:15.779
- Is that fun?
- No.

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:16.863
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:22.118
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.079
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:31.711
I do not want that guy 
representing himself as part of this company.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.964
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:36.049
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

01:32:36.133 --> 01:32:37.133
Mark, you got...

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.803
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:42.222
I want... I need you out here.

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:44.224
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

01:32:44.308 --> 01:32:46.393
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

01:32:46.477 --> 01:32:48.228
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

01:32:48.312 --> 01:32:50.230
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:51.398
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

01:32:51.482 --> 01:32:53.650
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.235
I'm aware of that! 
Mark, I am the CFO!

01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:56.736
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:58.405
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

01:32:58.489 --> 01:33:00.991
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:02.325
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.160
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:08.164
I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day, 
trying to find advertisers!

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.958
And how's it going so far?

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.923
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

01:33:21.637 --> 01:33:23.013
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:24.598
I'd like to freeze this bank account

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:28.143
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:32.647
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.697
Sean, he'll be right with you.

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.198
No problem.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.286
You know this is where they filmed 
Towering Inferno?

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:48.121
That's comforting.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.291
Hey, guys. Come on back.

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:55.045
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:57.881
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.883
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:05.013
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:08.642
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.729
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

01:34:12.855 --> 01:34:14.898
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.901
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:20.320
Now, let me ask you something.

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.405
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.010
Jesus Christ.

01:34:47.598 --> 01:34:48.682
When did you get back?

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:50.183
You scared me. I need you to knock.

01:34:50.267 --> 01:34:52.185
When did you get back?

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:54.938
I got back this afternoon.

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:56.523
And when were you gonna call me?

01:34:56.607 --> 01:34:59.275
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.279
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:07.242
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:08.868
Are you mocking me?

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:10.286
I brought you a present.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:14.958
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:16.126
What?

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:20.130
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:21.881
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.050
And you just never bothered to change it?

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:25.218
What?

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:26.886
I don't know how.

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:28.805
Do I look stupid to you?

01:35:28.931 --> 01:35:30.223
No, calm down.

01:35:30.307 --> 01:35:32.559
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:34.894
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:38.314
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:39.649
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

01:35:39.775 --> 01:35:42.819
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.070
every time you go out to see Mark.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:47.157
Not even remotely true, and I can promise you 
that the Silicon Valley sluts

01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:50.160
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:51.661
Please, open your present.

01:35:51.787 --> 01:35:53.663
Your phone does work.

01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:55.749
It's Mark.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:58.001
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.587
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:02.338
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.591
This'll be your first.

01:36:04.675 --> 01:36:05.759
Yeah.

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:07.093
- <i>You froze our account?</i>
- I did.

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:09.429
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:11.264
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

01:36:11.348 --> 01:36:12.932
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

01:36:13.017 --> 01:36:14.017
everything I've been working on?

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:15.185
We have been working on.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.770
Without money, the site can't function.

01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:19.105
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.273
We don't crash ever!

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:24.027
If the servers are down for even a day, 
our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:26.112
- Look...
- <i>Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:28.948
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.</i>

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:31.367
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.203
College kids are online
because their friends are online

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.455
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

01:36:35.539 --> 01:36:36.623
Don't you get that?

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:38.333
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:41.711
Holy shit.

01:36:44.548 --> 01:36:45.882
What is wrong with you?

01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:47.467
Did you like being nobody?

01:36:47.551 --> 01:36:49.302
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

01:36:49.386 --> 01:36:50.804
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:52.222
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,</i>

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:53.723
<i>and it certainly was not 
the act of a friend.</i>

01:36:53.849 --> 01:36:56.392
<i>You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?</i>

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.727
I am not going back to that life.

01:36:57.853 --> 01:37:00.230
- <i>Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

01:37:00.397 --> 01:37:02.690
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.235
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:07.654
<i>because, Wardo, 
I've got some good news.</i>

01:37:07.738 --> 01:37:08.905
I'm sorry.

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:13.743
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

01:37:13.869 --> 01:37:16.663
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.081
What is it?

01:37:18.207 --> 01:37:20.750
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:22.001
What?

01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:26.172
<i>Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:29.425
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:31.010
They need your signature
on some documents,

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:33.513
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:35.181
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:41.187
I'm on my way.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:42.772
- <i>Wardo?</i>
- Yeah?

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.399
We did it.

01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:48.945
Wardo?

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.447
You're going back there already?

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:52.699
Yes.

01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:56.619
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:02.250
Somebody stop her!

01:38:04.753 --> 01:38:05.795
Four documents.

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:07.797
The first two are common 
stock purchase agreements,

01:38:07.923 --> 01:38:10.967
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:14.470
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.722
The third is an exchange agreement

01:38:15.806 --> 01:38:18.558
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:20.894
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:22.729
How many shares of stock will I own?

01:38:22.813 --> 01:38:25.982
1,328,334.

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.442
Jesus Christ.

01:38:27.526 --> 01:38:30.445
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:33.281
Why the increase from the original 30%?

01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:36.117
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

01:38:36.827 --> 01:38:39.078
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:40.204
- Economics.
- Right.

01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:45.209
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

01:38:46.503 --> 01:38:49.756
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.135
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:57.055
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

01:38:59.308 --> 01:39:00.350
I can live with that.

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.268
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:08.942
Would you like to use my pen?

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:12.153
<i>Eduardo? Eduardo?</i>

01:39:13.906 --> 01:39:15.031
Can you please repeat the question?

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:17.325
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

01:39:17.409 --> 01:39:18.534
and now you want us to hear it twice?

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.495
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

01:39:20.579 --> 01:39:21.621
Well, go ahead.

01:39:21.705 --> 01:39:23.414
"Counsel: 'And when you 
signed these documents,

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:26.250
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?'"

01:39:26.335 --> 01:39:27.418
No.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.969
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

01:39:36.053 --> 01:39:39.222
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.060
I was your only friend.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:47.313
You had one friend.

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.194
My father won't even look at me.

01:39:53.278 --> 01:39:58.366
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:01.494
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.038
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:07.250
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:10.086
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

01:40:10.879 --> 01:40:12.130
And then before I left he said...

01:40:12.214 --> 01:40:13.297
But you gotta come back.

01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:15.883
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:18.428
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:20.263
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:21.639
A million members?

01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:22.890
Yeah.

01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:26.686
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

01:40:27.604 --> 01:40:28.813
Yeah.

01:40:32.234 --> 01:40:33.484
Yeah, I'll be here.

01:40:38.657 --> 01:40:39.824
You sure about this?

01:40:39.908 --> 01:40:41.075
You're 20 minutes late.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.618
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:43.828
and didn't have time to get dressed.

01:40:43.912 --> 01:40:46.080
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

01:40:46.165 --> 01:40:47.749
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:49.500
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:52.628
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.130
No, not Roth. Manningham.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.340
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:59.886
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"

01:41:00.429 --> 01:41:01.763
Walk out.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.056
Okay.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.029
<i>In late November, 
I got the e-mail from Mark</i>

01:41:18.113 --> 01:41:20.156
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.282
What else did the e-mail say?

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:24.035
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:28.164
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

01:41:28.832 --> 01:41:30.458
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

01:41:30.542 --> 01:41:34.462
<i>that he was now making an investment offer 
that was hard to turn down.</i>

01:41:34.546 --> 01:41:38.716
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:42.512
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,</i>

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.972
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:47.642
- <i>But it didn't matter.</i>
- <i>Why not?</i>

01:41:47.726 --> 01:41:49.936
<i>Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.</i>

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.604
What were you called out there for?

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.818
An ambush.

01:41:57.236 --> 01:41:59.070
Mr. Saverin. Hey. 
Right over here.

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:07.245
Hey, man.

01:42:07.329 --> 01:42:08.371
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:11.165
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:14.710
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:20.883
But then I started reading.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:26.055
Wait, what is this?

01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:29.642
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:30.810
What is this?

01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:44.574
Mr. Saverin.

01:42:47.202 --> 01:42:48.369
Mark!

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.122
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

01:42:51.206 --> 01:42:52.248
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.791
- Is he?
- Yes.

01:42:55.377 --> 01:42:58.129
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:00.047
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

01:43:01.258 --> 01:43:02.884
You were told that 
if new investors came along...

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:06.095
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.932
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:11.309
It wasn't.

01:43:11.393 --> 01:43:15.021
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:15.105 --> 01:43:16.439
It wasn't.

01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:19.442
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:20.568
It wasn't.

01:43:20.652 --> 01:43:23.321
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:23.405 --> 01:43:24.488
It wasn't.

01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:27.575
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:28.577 --> 01:43:31.245
.03%

01:43:39.087 --> 01:43:41.380
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

01:43:41.465 --> 01:43:44.008
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

01:43:44.092 --> 01:43:45.968
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.678
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:49.096
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:50.223
You're not a part of Facebook.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:52.683
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:54.101
This because I froze the account?

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:56.354
You think we'd let you parade around 
in your ridiculous suits,

01:43:56.438 --> 01:43:57.480
pretending you were running this company?

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:59.899
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

01:43:59.983 --> 01:44:04.362
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-flops, 
you pretentious douchebag!

01:44:04.446 --> 01:44:06.113
Security's here. 
You'll be leaving now.

01:44:06.198 --> 01:44:09.116
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:11.327
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

01:44:13.997 --> 01:44:18.209
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

01:44:18.293 --> 01:44:20.419
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

01:44:20.504 --> 01:44:23.464
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

01:44:23.548 --> 01:44:25.258
And I'll bet what you hated the most

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:28.761
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

01:44:29.221 --> 01:44:32.056
Which I am. 
You better lawyer up, asshole.

01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:36.686
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

01:44:43.151 --> 01:44:46.112
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

01:44:48.073 --> 01:44:49.365
Hang on.

01:44:51.576 --> 01:44:53.160
Almost forgot.

01:44:54.204 --> 01:44:56.497
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.124
I drew it on the account you froze.

01:45:03.422 --> 01:45:05.965
I like standing next to you, Sean.

01:45:07.217 --> 01:45:09.343
It makes me look so tough.

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.774
Well...

01:45:24.234 --> 01:45:27.153
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

01:45:27.237 --> 01:45:29.530
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

01:45:29.614 --> 01:45:31.699
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

01:45:31.783 --> 01:45:34.910
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:40.041
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:42.752
You were kind of rough on him.

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.837
That's life in the NFL.

01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:46.672
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:48.924
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

01:45:50.218 --> 01:45:52.303
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

01:45:52.387 --> 01:45:53.596
He almost killed it.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.558
I'll send flowers.

01:45:59.269 --> 01:46:03.981
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together 
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

01:46:04.066 --> 01:46:05.316
Ashleigh's a sister.

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.942
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:10.196
Yeah. I know who she is. 
Are you guys...

01:46:10.822 --> 01:46:12.490
Ashleigh? Me? No.

01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:14.033
Well, a little bit.

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:15.951
Why?

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:17.870
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

01:46:17.954 --> 01:46:21.207
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:24.043
Thanks. I appreciate that.

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:26.128
These came in for you.

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.005
Put them on my desk.

01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:36.389
What's the package?

01:46:37.265 --> 01:46:38.307
Nothing.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.228
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

01:46:42.312 --> 01:46:43.604
Refresh.

01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:45.314
Sweet!

01:46:51.321 --> 01:46:53.364
And you're not a hugger.

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:54.949
I know.

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.036
One million!

01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:03.374
Who's got champagne? Huh?

01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:06.502
I've got champagne.

01:47:26.356 --> 01:47:29.942
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

01:47:30.026 --> 01:47:33.112
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

01:47:33.196 --> 01:47:36.198
It is the true digitalization of real life.

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.742
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

01:47:38.827 --> 01:47:40.536
You don't just go to a party anymore.

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:44.373
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:45.833
And tagging. The idea...

01:47:45.917 --> 01:47:49.128
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

01:47:56.887 --> 01:47:59.263
All right, shut the music down!

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.265
The party's over!

01:48:01.349 --> 01:48:03.142
Everybody, go home!

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:06.103
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

01:48:06.188 --> 01:48:07.563
How they check their friends' status updates.

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:09.148
Wait. That's weird. 
Why did the music stop?

01:48:09.232 --> 01:48:10.399
Check to see which one of their friends

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:12.401
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:14.069
Seriously, what happened to the music?

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:16.113
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

01:48:16.198 --> 01:48:18.157
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:21.911
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

01:48:30.962 --> 01:48:33.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:37.092
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

01:48:37.427 --> 01:48:39.261
Then it's all good.

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.097
- It's the cops.
- What?

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.224
Shit! Shit.

01:48:43.308 --> 01:48:47.061
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

01:48:47.604 --> 01:48:49.772
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

01:48:50.982 --> 01:48:52.024
What's going on?

01:48:52.108 --> 01:48:54.693
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:56.320
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

01:48:56.404 --> 01:48:59.198
I can tell them to turn the music down.

01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:04.161
That's not mine.

01:49:04.579 --> 01:49:07.581
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:09.083
Oh, my God.

01:49:09.167 --> 01:49:10.876
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:12.002
No, sir. No.

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:14.338
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

01:49:19.427 --> 01:49:20.928
What's this?

01:49:21.137 --> 01:49:22.846
That's an EpiPen.

01:49:23.932 --> 01:49:26.267
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:28.769
How old are you?

01:49:29.354 --> 01:49:32.273
Twenty-one.

01:49:32.357 --> 01:49:33.774
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

01:49:33.858 --> 01:49:35.526
Lying only makes it worse.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:39.405
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:51.458
Hello.

01:49:51.543 --> 01:49:54.044
Listen, something's happened.

01:50:01.344 --> 01:50:02.386
Shit.

01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:04.388
No, it's all right. 
It's gonna be all right.

01:50:04.472 --> 01:50:08.475
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.315
Interns.

01:50:14.399 --> 01:50:16.233
It was just a party.

01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:22.406
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:24.658
I know.

01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:26.410
You know with an intern...

01:50:26.494 --> 01:50:28.662
No, it's cool. 
I have it under control.

01:50:28.747 --> 01:50:30.331
I will get it under control.

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.791
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.418
But this is gonna be news now.

01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:37.671
You don't think Wardo was involved, do you?

01:50:37.756 --> 01:50:38.797
I mean, do you think...

01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:39.965
No.

01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:42.051
Or Manningham. One of them.

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:45.387
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke in there, 
because it got in there.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.306
You believe me. 
God, this is gonna be fine.

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:53.354
Right?

01:50:56.107 --> 01:50:57.691
Go home, Sean.

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:14.124
<i>Mark?</i>

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:17.086
<i>Mark.</i>

01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:21.256
We're done for the day.

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:23.926
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

01:51:27.597 --> 01:51:29.515
What happened to Sean?

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:32.267
He still owns 7% of the company.

01:51:36.439 --> 01:51:40.693
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:42.111
I can't.

01:51:49.786 --> 01:51:51.036
I'm not a bad guy.

01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:52.621
I know that.

01:51:52.997 --> 01:51:56.500
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

01:51:56.626 --> 01:51:58.085
And the other 15?

01:51:58.169 --> 01:52:01.296
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:06.301
What happens now?

01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:11.682
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

01:52:12.183 --> 01:52:13.642
Then they'll come back up to the office,

01:52:13.727 --> 01:52:17.020
and start working on a 
settlement agreement to present to you.

01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:19.022
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

01:52:19.649 --> 01:52:22.484
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.737
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:27.823
They say one unflattering word about you 
in public, you own their wife and kids.

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:29.116
I invented Facebook.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.326
I'm talking about a jury.

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:34.163
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:36.623
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:39.084
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:40.377
Likeability.

01:52:40.503 --> 01:52:43.338
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:44.798
and I could get a jury to believe

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:47.593
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

01:52:47.677 --> 01:52:48.761
Watch what else.

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:51.346
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

01:52:52.098 --> 01:52:54.308
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

01:52:54.392 --> 01:52:56.477
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:58.687
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

01:53:00.356 --> 01:53:01.482
Farm animals.

01:53:01.566 --> 01:53:02.733
Yeah.

01:53:03.735 --> 01:53:06.278
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

01:53:06.362 --> 01:53:08.614
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:11.074
Pay them.

01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:12.576
In the scheme of things,

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:14.369
it's a speeding ticket.

01:53:16.372 --> 01:53:18.749
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:21.752
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

01:53:21.878 --> 01:53:23.378
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:24.713
Thanks.

01:53:25.548 --> 01:53:27.883
I appreciate your help today.

01:53:31.721 --> 01:53:33.972
You're not an asshole, Mark.

01:53:35.225 --> 01:53:37.726
You're just trying so hard to be.
