00:01.634 --> 00:11.044
.

00:11.044 --> 00:14.280
'...a bit. Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr.
Welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.280 --> 00:17.450
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history...'

00:17.450 --> 00:18.918
That is apeshit.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.655
'...as told by blind drunk
comedians.' Mmm, loving it.

00:22.655 --> 00:26.726
'What obscure event from the annals
of history doesn't go down better

00:26.726 --> 00:29.562
with ice and a slice?'
Let's fucking do this.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.232
What the shivering fuck
is wrong with you?

00:32.232 --> 00:34.534
Not gonna happen
unless you fuck off.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.803
(blows raspberry) I got money.

00:36.803 --> 00:39.572
This is bullshit.

00:39.572 --> 00:43.009
I can't believe that got filmed.
So sorry.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.724
'Now it's time to learn about
the Cottingley Fairies,

00:57.724 --> 01:01.628
a story that combines young women,
alcohol and faking it and for once,

01:01.628 --> 01:04.864
doesn't end with me sitting on
the edge of the bed crying.'

01:04.864 --> 01:08.368
'Charlotte Ritchie tells this one
after four pints of beer...'

01:08.368 --> 01:09.969
(man) What is it?
Wine.

01:09.969 --> 01:12.038
'...and a bottle of white wine.'

01:13.072 --> 01:15.708
This is the story of
the Cottingley Fairies.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.645
And there's this guy to help me out.
So...

01:19.712 --> 01:22.048
All right, I'm taking you back.

01:22.048 --> 01:26.286
1917. For most people, 1917, shit.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.788
But for Elsie Griffiths
and Frances Wright,

01:28.788 --> 01:33.226
this is a day that's gone pretty
well. They're playing in the garden.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.728
"Frances, please don't splash me."

01:35.728 --> 01:38.731
"Mum and Dad hate it
when we're covered with water."

01:38.731 --> 01:41.668
They're from Bradford,
that's the accent.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.404
Every day, they come back.
Mum, Polly, says,

01:44.404 --> 01:47.774
"Polly, why... Sorry, Frances,
why are you covered in water?"

01:47.774 --> 01:51.077
Frances is like, "I love it
when I get all my clothes all wet."

01:51.077 --> 01:54.113
And Elsie goes, "Shut up,
no, it's cos of the fairies."

01:54.113 --> 01:56.749
"It's cos of the fairies.
Fairies, Mum."

01:56.749 --> 02:00.753
Dad says, "Bullshit, girls, sorry to
swear in front of you, but bullshit."

02:00.753 --> 02:04.023
Frances goes, "That's so rude.
I'm only the cousin."

02:04.023 --> 02:07.527
"I'm not even your daughter.
It's embarrassing you swear."

02:07.527 --> 02:11.164
Elsie goes, "If you don't believe me,
give us your camera, then."

02:11.164 --> 02:15.068
Dad days, "Fine, if you're so, if
you're so crazy about these ferries,

02:15.068 --> 02:16.903
fairies, fairies."

02:16.903 --> 02:21.040
Oh, God. Where am I now?
Manchester, sorry. (laughs)

02:21.040 --> 02:22.809
"Here's me camera."

02:22.809 --> 02:25.245
"Fine, I'm gonna take
the photograph."

02:26.312 --> 02:29.048
So, they take it to the beck
and they go,

02:29.048 --> 02:32.919
"Fairies, please, we know that you're
a very private gang of people."

02:32.919 --> 02:35.255
"But will you take
a photograph with us?"

02:35.255 --> 02:36.456
The fairies are like,

02:36.456 --> 02:40.126
"Yes, we'd love to be exposed to
the human race through this format."

02:40.126 --> 02:43.363
"This is how we want everybody
to know about our existence."

02:43.363 --> 02:45.031
So, they dance around...

02:45.999 --> 02:49.168
...Frances, who's like that.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.344
So, the girls are like. "Mum and Dad,
look what we've got, Mum and Dad."

02:58.344 --> 03:01.247
"Would you believe it,
I've got it on the camera."

03:01.247 --> 03:04.117
Dad sees the girls looking lovely.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.386
But he sees these fairies
and he thinks,

03:06.386 --> 03:09.722
"This is great,
but why do they look like paper?"

03:09.722 --> 03:11.724
(laughs)

03:11.724 --> 03:14.794
He says, "Girls, this is...
this is bullshit.

03:14.794 --> 03:18.565
"I'm looking right at the paper
that they're made of."

03:18.565 --> 03:21.634
"None of this is gonna go anywhere
and I'm sure as heck,

03:21.634 --> 03:25.238
no famous writer is gonna pick
this up and make this famous."

03:25.238 --> 03:30.843
But then Mum goes, "Wowee, this is
absolutely fucking 100% legit."

03:30.843 --> 03:33.046
"And I'm part of the Theolosisists."

03:33.046 --> 03:38.184
Oh, shit, what is the name of that
society? Theolos... theolos.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.653
Theosophical Society.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.455
Come away, I heard that.

03:42.455 --> 03:47.226
"I'm part of the Theosophical
Society, miraculously."

03:47.226 --> 03:51.431
Which ultimately means what?
Believing in supernatural things.

03:51.431 --> 03:55.602
"Brilliant, I'm gonna send them
to the Se... Theosophical Society."

03:55.602 --> 03:58.438
The girls are like,
"Yes. This is awesome."

03:58.438 --> 04:00.039
Secretly high fiving like,

04:00.039 --> 04:04.010
"Frances, don't say a fucking thing
about it not being real." (laughs)

04:05.278 --> 04:08.247
Goodness gracious, that goes down,
doesn't it?

04:08.247 --> 04:13.853
So, she gets these pictures to
the Theosophical Society.

04:13.853 --> 04:17.523
And they go absolutely wild for it.

04:17.523 --> 04:21.628
They cannot believe it. "Wowee,
this is incredible, actual fairies."

04:21.628 --> 04:25.031
"I've never seen a fairy,
I've always hoped to, have you?"

04:25.031 --> 04:26.232
"I've seen one once."

04:26.232 --> 04:28.635
"We didn't believe you.
You were drunk."

04:28.635 --> 04:32.805
So, they put on an exhibition
and they go, "This stuff is real."

04:32.805 --> 04:35.875
The exhibition is seen by
a man called Edward Gardner,

04:35.875 --> 04:40.446
who's a theos... theosologist,
theodro.... theososolist.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.749
Theosolophist.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.953
A theos... (laughs)
...a theos... theos...

04:46.953 --> 04:49.589
A guy that believes in fairies.

04:49.589 --> 04:52.425
He looks at multiple photographs
and says,

04:52.425 --> 04:54.994
"That's interesting,
I can see a gnome there,

04:54.994 --> 04:57.597
a possibility of an alien
in this corn field."

04:57.597 --> 05:02.335
"What the heck is this?"
says Edward Gardner.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.038
"Fairies right next to young girls."

05:05.038 --> 05:08.841
He thinks, "This is my day,
this is my dream come true."

05:08.841 --> 05:12.045
So this is a big deal.
This has repercussions,

05:12.045 --> 05:16.649
bam, bam, bam, bam,
all over England.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.953
And the big cheese that is known
as Arthur Conan Doyle,

05:20.953 --> 05:25.091
he has been writing Sherlock,
he's a famous rationalist,

05:25.091 --> 05:29.028
he's good at plots, so good at plots,
he's super clever.

05:30.029 --> 05:34.834
But he's a huge spiritualist
and he would love, it seems,

05:34.834 --> 05:38.237
to believe in fairies.
He gets wind of this. So he says,

05:38.237 --> 05:43.042
"Edward Gardner, I feel very,
very passionately about fairies,

05:43.042 --> 05:46.245
but unfortunately,
I don't have the care or the time

05:46.245 --> 05:51.651
to go and meet these fairies. Please
will you go and talk to these girls."

05:51.651 --> 05:55.855
And Edward Gardener does, for his
good friend, Arthur Conan Doyle,

05:55.855 --> 06:00.626
writer of Sherluck, Sherluck.
(laughs) Sherlick, Surelick. (laughs)

06:00.626 --> 06:03.596
So, he goes up there and he says,
"Girls."

06:03.596 --> 06:05.832
And they were like,
"Ah, who are you?"

06:05.832 --> 06:10.870
He says, "I'm Edward Gardner
and I'm a theolosophist."

06:10.870 --> 06:12.638
"Theosolophist."

06:12.638 --> 06:15.708
"I'm a theosolophist." (laughs)

06:15.708 --> 06:18.444
"And I'm very drunk." (laughs)

06:21.414 --> 06:24.951
He says, "It's really important
that we photograph these fairies

06:24.951 --> 06:27.053
and we've brought two more cameras."

06:27.053 --> 06:29.956
The girls look at each other.
"Oh, God, shit, fuck."

06:29.956 --> 06:31.758
"Do you remember that?"
"Yeah."

06:31.758 --> 06:34.227
And so they hang around, like that.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.868
They're like, "Nothing's gonna happen
unless you just, like, fuck off."

06:41.868 --> 06:44.637
Edward is like, "Fine.
I will go and have a cup of tea

06:44.637 --> 06:47.907
with your father and your mother,
the cynic and the believer,

06:47.907 --> 06:50.042
and I will let you take photographs."

06:50.042 --> 06:53.446
The girls are like, "Yes,
snap happy, let's fucking do this."

06:53.446 --> 06:57.150
They take loads of photographs,
like this, styling it out,

06:57.150 --> 06:59.919
what's going on, that's it.
And that happens.

06:59.919 --> 07:05.358
They go to Edward and he goes,
"Brilliant, thank you so much,

07:05.358 --> 07:09.228
Arthur Conan Doyle is going to be
beside himself with excitement."

07:09.228 --> 07:11.430
The girls are like, "Yeah, brilliant,

07:11.430 --> 07:15.835
I don't wanna hear from you
for another 70 years."

07:15.835 --> 07:20.573
So, Edward... Conan Doyle, he's like,

07:20.573 --> 07:24.710
"Oh, I hope those fairies are real. I
love them and like the idea of them."

07:24.710 --> 07:28.681
Edward goes, "These girls have shown
me the photographs. They're real."

07:28.681 --> 07:30.249
And... (laughs)

07:30.249 --> 07:35.721
Arthur goes,
"Oh, my God, fairies are real."

07:35.721 --> 07:40.126
So, Arthur Conan Doyle takes
the photos and he publishes them

07:40.126 --> 07:41.894
and puts it out to the world.

07:41.894 --> 07:46.866
And then these pictures of
these girls go worldwide.

07:46.866 --> 07:51.838
I mean, everyone wants to believe in
fairies. So Arthur Conan Doyle said,

07:51.838 --> 07:56.042
"As soon as you have evidence of
fairies, everything can be real."

07:56.042 --> 08:00.046
"The Loch Ness Monster can be real.
Bigfoot can be real."

08:00.046 --> 08:02.048
"Jabba the Hutt can be real."

08:02.048 --> 08:06.052
"Fucking yes! Fairies are real."

08:07.520 --> 08:12.625
It wasn't to last. In 1978,
a cynic called James Randy,

08:12.625 --> 08:16.829
who's a sceptic
and an illusionist and magician,

08:16.829 --> 08:20.833
looked at the photographs and said,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

08:20.833 --> 08:25.071
"I think, I think these fairies
that I've seen in these pictures

08:25.071 --> 08:27.173
existed in a book that was published

08:27.173 --> 08:30.042
exactly the same time
as these pictures came out."

08:30.042 --> 08:34.647
"There's no way that fairies would
have shown themselves to these girls

08:34.647 --> 08:40.253
and then also posed for a book.
So, is it a hoax?"

08:42.655 --> 08:43.956
Is the question.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.959
I'm honestly so drunk,
it's absolutely awful.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.830
So, the group of spiritualists
who believe in this kind of thing,

08:50.830 --> 08:55.134
they go to see the girls, who are now
in their 80s and they ask them,

08:55.134 --> 08:57.670
"Come on, girls, did you fake it?"

08:57.670 --> 09:00.973
"Did you fake the, did you fake
the answers, let's be real,

09:00.973 --> 09:03.276
did you fake the photographs?"

09:03.276 --> 09:05.111
And the girls say...

09:06.646 --> 09:07.847
"Yes, we did."

09:09.081 --> 09:12.251
"We did. Good and proper."

09:12.251 --> 09:15.254
"It was all a joke." (laughs)

09:15.254 --> 09:18.624
Elsie's like, "Give a shit,
I don't care, you believe me."

09:18.624 --> 09:21.360
"Arthur Conan Doyle,
you think you're so great,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.629
but you fucking believed me."

09:25.965 --> 09:28.634
So the girls came clean
in the fairies.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.002
(laughs)

09:30.002 --> 09:34.106
This is... Oh, this is horrible,
this is my worst nightmare.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.107
OK.

09:36.609 --> 09:40.646
The girls claimed... (laughs)

09:40.646 --> 09:43.683
Came clean.
Please let me go home, OK.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.684
(hiccups)

09:46.852 --> 09:51.023
'The question is, is this some kind
of elaborate hoax? No, it isn't.'

09:51.023 --> 09:52.725
'We really are making a TV show

09:52.725 --> 09:55.194
where comedians
get off their fucking tits.'

09:55.194 --> 09:57.096
'That's all for part one.'

09:57.096 --> 10:00.232
'Join us after the break
for a very gassy Nish Kumar.'

10:00.232 --> 10:04.203
His invention.
I've farted again, I'm so sorry.

10:09.008 --> 10:09.208
.

10:11.711 --> 10:11.911
.

10:13.512 --> 10:17.283
'Welcome back to Drunk History,
a show that has history in its blood

10:17.283 --> 10:21.187
and a whole lot of alcohol.'
Fucking yes!

10:23.489 --> 10:25.324
'Next up tonight, we have a story

10:25.324 --> 10:28.728
that combines drunkenness
and telephones, but for once,

10:28.728 --> 10:32.131
doesn't end with me sending
a photo of my erection to my mum.'

10:32.131 --> 10:34.133
'Sorry, YOUR mum.'

10:34.133 --> 10:36.635
'Nish Kumar is telling this one,

10:36.635 --> 10:40.506
having sunk four pints of beer and a
bottle and a half of red wine.'

10:40.506 --> 10:41.507
Oh.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.479
I'm gonna be telling you the story
of how Alexander Graham Bell

10:46.479 --> 10:50.516
invented the telephone, or did he?
Spoiler alert.

10:50.516 --> 10:54.887
1847, Edinburgh.
Within Edinburgh, there's a child.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.789
It's Alexander Graham Bell.

10:56.789 --> 11:00.326
Alexander Graham Bell
was a child prodigy.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.528
He reminded me of a young me.

11:02.528 --> 11:06.932
His mum, deaf,
full deaf, classic deaf.

11:06.932 --> 11:10.336
So he invents a whole system
of sign language

11:10.336 --> 11:13.806
to communicate with his mother,
saying all sorts of stuff like,

11:13.806 --> 11:18.511
"No, Mum, I wasn't doing that."

11:18.511 --> 11:24.283
"I had just had a bath,
that's why I have no clothes on."

11:24.283 --> 11:27.053
"I don't know why it's pointing
that way."

11:28.120 --> 11:31.624
So we've established the Bellend
was a child prodigy.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.926
Fast forward to 1874.

11:33.926 --> 11:37.196
The Bellend is working in Boston,
working as a professor,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.331
he's thinking about new things to do.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.802
He's like, "Had this idea
that you could have communication,

11:42.802 --> 11:45.104
you could communicate with people,

11:45.104 --> 11:48.207
even though you're not in
the same room as them."

11:48.207 --> 11:52.945
He sets about working on
what will become the telephone.

11:52.945 --> 11:57.249
He meets your boy, Tommy Watson,
big Tommy Dubbs.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.919
Tommy Watson's like,
"What's up, Bellend?"

11:59.919 --> 12:02.288
Bellend's like,
"How did you know my name?"

12:02.288 --> 12:06.025
Tommy Watson's like, "You have it
on your shirt. It's pretty weird."

12:06.025 --> 12:08.327
Then they're having a chat,
usual stuff.

12:08.327 --> 12:11.730
"How's it going?
What are you into? Does she like me?"

12:11.730 --> 12:15.534
"Do these trousers work? Should
I change my name to laser dude?"

12:15.534 --> 12:19.638
Those were the things that big
Tommy Dubbs was asking the Bellend.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.640
(laughs)

12:26.312 --> 12:29.014
They both realised that
they're both interested

12:29.014 --> 12:32.051
in turning electricity
into sound waves.

12:32.051 --> 12:35.287
"I've got all the theory,
I don't know how to make this shit."

12:35.287 --> 12:38.124
"I'm a designer,
I know how to make everything."

12:38.124 --> 12:41.127
The Bellend cannot believe his luck.

12:41.127 --> 12:44.997
He is like, "Are you fucking
shitting in my mouth?"

12:44.997 --> 12:48.134
And they do a Victorian version
of a high five,

12:48.134 --> 12:50.069
which is just where they sort of

12:50.069 --> 12:52.905
touch one of their foreheads
to their chins.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.108
That is true, that isn't just me
thinking of a weird thing

12:56.108 --> 12:59.612
that you gotta make actors
do afterwards. (laughs)

13:01.247 --> 13:04.717
I need to do a fart. I've done it.

13:04.717 --> 13:08.254
Can't believe that got filmed.
So sorry.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.024
They worked for years.
They're trying everything.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.627
Cups on a string,
two glasses against a wall.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.663
One of them is putting their foot
against the other's ear

13:17.663 --> 13:19.598
and just screaming out the window.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.935
It's not easy,
turning electricity into sound.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.204
It's not like turning alcohol
into piss,

13:25.204 --> 13:27.273
which I'm doing literally right now.

13:28.207 --> 13:32.711
Cut to 10th March, 1876.
They have a breakthrough.

13:32.711 --> 13:36.482
The first-ever phone call.

13:37.716 --> 13:42.521
"Mr Watson, come here.
I want to see you."

13:42.521 --> 13:47.726
Tommy Dubbs is like, "What the fuck?"
(laughs)

13:47.726 --> 13:50.729
"Mate! Oh, my God!"

13:50.729 --> 13:54.833
"We are not in the same room.
That is apeshit."

13:54.833 --> 13:57.970
The Bellend is like,
"Pull it together, big Tommy Dubbs."

13:57.970 --> 14:00.673
Tommy Dubbs is like,
"I can't pull it together!"

14:00.673 --> 14:03.309
"This is really weird." (laughs)

14:03.309 --> 14:05.911
"I'm not hanging up,
you've gotta hang up."

14:05.911 --> 14:11.317
"No, you hang up."
(laughs) "Phones."

14:12.718 --> 14:14.720
(laughs)

14:17.723 --> 14:21.727
And the next thing you know he
creates the Bell Telephone Company,

14:21.727 --> 14:25.531
possibly the least imaginative name
for a company of all time.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.967
It, er...

14:27.967 --> 14:32.037
He becomes very rich,
so rich, DuckTales rich.

14:32.037 --> 14:37.543
We're talking Johnny Coins, that's
his nickname that he gives himself.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.479
And everyone's like,
"Wow, that's a bad nickname."

14:40.479 --> 14:44.383
And he's like,
(blows raspberry) "I got money."

14:44.383 --> 14:48.921
So, the phone is going great guns,
absolutely legendary stuff.

14:48.921 --> 14:54.193
How do you improve it? Well,
enter, stage right, Tommy Edison.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.196
Thomas Edison was one of
the great inventors of his era.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.232
He knows his onions,
largely because he invented them.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.534
He's had a series of light bulb
moments,

15:02.534 --> 15:05.371
when he invented the phonograph,
and telegraph.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.773
Notably,
when he invented the light bulb.

15:07.773 --> 15:11.877
Edison gets right involved,
gets his dick right in the mix.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.814
"Right, we've got this thing, it's
going well, what are we calling it?"

15:15.814 --> 15:18.851
He sits there, thinking about it
for a while and blam,

15:18.851 --> 15:22.655
a light bulb goes off above his head,
he goes, "The shouting shoe."

15:22.655 --> 15:25.724
And they're like,
"Wow, that is a worse name."

15:25.724 --> 15:29.395
"Please don't get involved
in naming anything again, ever."

15:30.529 --> 15:32.364
"What's your second idea?"

15:32.364 --> 15:34.633
Edison's like, "What are you saying,

15:34.633 --> 15:37.403
when people sort of like,
pick up the phone?"

15:37.403 --> 15:40.372
"When you answer the phone, you go,
'Ahoy-hoy.'"

15:40.372 --> 15:46.111
Edison's like, "Bellend, what the
shivering fuck is wrong with you?"

15:46.111 --> 15:47.413
"Ahoy-hoy?"

15:47.413 --> 15:51.283
"Yeah, mate, it's a good idea,
ahoy-hoy."

15:51.283 --> 15:55.354
"All right, how about this,
it's gonna blow your mind."

15:56.488 --> 15:58.724
"Hello."

15:58.724 --> 16:00.793
And Bellend is like,

16:00.793 --> 16:04.963
"Edison, you absolute genius."

16:04.963 --> 16:08.133
"That is a full brain orgasm,

16:08.133 --> 16:11.603
all over the vagina
of my previous idea."

16:13.205 --> 16:15.674
Edison is like,
"Pfft, what can I say, mate?"

16:15.674 --> 16:18.744
"I've got a light bulb living
ahead... above my head."

16:18.744 --> 16:22.648
"It just sits there, occasionally
it goes off, I have a great idea."

16:22.648 --> 16:24.750
And the Bellend stands up
and he goes,

16:24.750 --> 16:28.487
"We've done it, we've got the
telephone, we've got the greeting."

16:28.487 --> 16:31.156
And then,
he unleashes the immortal words,

16:31.156 --> 16:36.595
"One day, there will be a telephone
in every major city in the USA."

16:36.595 --> 16:42.034
It established him as one of
the great inventors of all time.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.505
Or did it?
Is there more to this story?

16:46.505 --> 16:50.442
Yes. Otherwise,
I would not have asked that question.

16:50.442 --> 16:53.412
I'm gonna tell you about
a man you've never heard of.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.414
Antonio Meucci.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.185
The year, 1860, the place, New York.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.623
The place within the place,
somewhere in New York.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.726
Antonio Meucci is
an Italian immigrant.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.795
He's a man who's down on his luck.

17:09.795 --> 17:12.531
Oh, he's down on his luck.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.733
His wife has got severe arthritis.
She can't even walk.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.136
He's got nothing.

17:17.136 --> 17:20.305
The only thing he is good at,
inventing shit.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.509
Meucci sat there, his invention.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.810
I've farted again.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.480
It's really bad. I'm so sorry.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.551
They're gonna use this in the edit,
because of course, why wouldn't you?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.154
And I sort of don't hold it against
them for it.

17:35.154 --> 17:38.724
This might even make the trailer.
I'm so sad.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.996
He's in his workshop,
trying to communicate with his wife.

17:43.996 --> 17:48.801
She's next door. He develops
a device he calls the telefono.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.304
He's excited about it.
"Wow, this could be a great thing."

17:52.304 --> 17:55.674
Then he invites the Italian press
who are based in New York.

17:55.674 --> 17:59.511
He's like, "Look at this new thing.
I've got a way of speaking."

17:59.511 --> 18:01.046
"I'm here. Hello, hello."

18:01.046 --> 18:04.550
"My wife's in the other room
and she's like, hello, hello."

18:04.550 --> 18:09.688
Or whatever hello is in Italian.
"Good pasta to you both."

18:09.688 --> 18:11.924
Something less racist than that.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.358
And their reaction is,

18:13.358 --> 18:17.029
"Wow, this is amazing, I'm gonna
write a whole article about it."

18:17.029 --> 18:20.999
So he's there, writing in Italian.
Italian, Italian, Italian.

18:20.999 --> 18:24.970
People are going, "Oh, my God! This
is in Italian, I don't understand."

18:24.970 --> 18:29.007
The upshot of it is,
no-one's interested.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.611
Two years later, when Bell is granted
a patent on the telephone,

18:32.611 --> 18:34.346
Meucci is furious.

18:34.346 --> 18:39.084
The Bellend is lapping up plaudits
like cats drink milk. He's loving it.

18:39.084 --> 18:43.922
He's just sat there,
"Oh, plaudits, mmm. Loving it."

18:43.922 --> 18:45.924
But Meucci's sat at home thinking,

18:45.924 --> 18:51.530
"I invented that. That was
my machine. This is bullshit."

18:51.530 --> 18:57.135
Antonio Meucci sued the Bellend to
prove that he had invented the phone

18:57.135 --> 18:59.438
before Tommy Dubbs and the Bellend.

18:59.438 --> 19:03.442
He sued them for 13 years. He was
kind of dragged through litigation.

19:03.442 --> 19:09.515
The court was gonna hear his case and
then, after 13 years, bang! He dies.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.251
And his legal action died with him.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.754
It's not fair!

19:15.754 --> 19:20.726
Meucci's just a sort of footnote
in history, until 2002.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.194
The Supreme Court rules

19:22.194 --> 19:25.964
that Meucci should be credited
as an inventor of the telephone.

19:28.934 --> 19:34.506
"Yes. Finally. It's been over
a 100 years, you fucking dicks."

19:34.506 --> 19:36.208
"How did it take you this long

19:36.208 --> 19:39.678
to fucking acknowledge
the amount of work that I did?"

19:39.678 --> 19:41.713
"Look at this situation now."

19:41.713 --> 19:46.485
"Some chubby Asian kid is gonna
re-tell it, while he's drunk,

19:46.485 --> 19:50.923
for a Comedy Central TV show.
This is bullshit."

19:50.923 --> 19:55.027
The time has come for Meucci
to receive his day in the sun.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.464
Go fuck yourself,
Alexander Graham Bell. Cheers.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.473
It's quite a bad wine.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.609
'That was fun,
but it's all nonsense.'

20:10.609 --> 20:14.279
'The first phone call was from
some annoying bastard selling PPI.'

20:14.279 --> 20:17.082
'Join us next time,
when we'll demonstrate again,

20:17.082 --> 20:20.552
that whilst our comedians can
tell us some cracking stories,

20:20.552 --> 20:23.889
there's no way they should be
in charge of heavy machinery.'

20:23.889 --> 20:24.890
'Goodnight.'

21:22.948 --> 21:23.148
.
