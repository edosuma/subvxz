04:22.963 --> 04:26.365
The smart lock controls
the front door access,

the whole system

of a button.

it's really user friendly
once you get the hang of it.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.332
And here is
a quick start guide.

05:00.434 --> 05:04.202

you're pretty lucky.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.380

I would love to live out here.

But I feel so much safer now.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.752
Yes, you were. [chuckles]

25:09.308 --> 25:12.610
He broke into my house,
he was trying to kill me.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.513
-[continues gasping]
-Okay, okay, hey.
Hey, you're safe now.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.881
Okay?

25:17.517 --> 25:19.316
Um, uh, I...

25:19.318 --> 25:21.619
Can we, can we call the cops?
Do you have a phone?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.787
I don't. I left it at home.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.823
But I can drive you
to the police station
right now,

25:25.825 --> 25:27.591
you can just tell them
everything that happened.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.792
-Okay?
-Thank you.

25:28.794 --> 25:29.960
-You're okay.
-Thank you so much.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.462
-You're okay, okay?
-[gasping]

25:31.530 --> 25:32.563
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.435
[tires squealing]

25:40.673 --> 25:43.007
I think the police station's
back that way.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.675
[calmly] No, it's not.
It's this way.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.616
[breathing deeply]

26:11.103 --> 26:12.803
[gasps, grunts]

26:21.447 --> 26:23.547
[indistinct chatter]

26:26.319 --> 26:28.152
[installer] We got
to ditch the car

26:28.253 --> 26:29.553
so they can't track us.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.089
[inaudible]

26:32.091 --> 26:33.924
[accomplice] It was supposed
to be an easy robbery,

26:33.926 --> 26:36.327
and now you're telling me
I have to ditch my car?

26:37.430 --> 26:39.129
First you killed the neighbor,
now this.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.165
[installer] I had to kill him,
he saw my face.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.900
[accomplice] What happened
this time?

26:42.902 --> 26:46.236
[installer] The dog
bit my fingers off.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.771
[accomplice] You didn't
tell me she had a dog.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.507
[installer] She didn't
when I installed the locks.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.543
[accomplice] Did you at least,
get anything valuable?

26:52.645 --> 26:55.112
[installer] You think that's
what I was focusing on?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.247
[arguing continues
indistinctly]

27:03.522 --> 27:05.789
[arguing continues
indistinctly]

27:05.791 --> 27:07.424
[accomplice] Shut up.
You shut up.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.159
[installer responds
indistinctly]

27:18.771 --> 27:20.304
[whimpering softly]

27:22.508 --> 27:24.408
[gasps in relief]

27:24.410 --> 27:26.443
[arguing continues
indistinctly]

27:27.780 --> 27:29.313
-[accomplice] Shut up.
-[installer] I'm losing
blood here.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.814
[accomplice] I'm going
to take care of this.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.616
I'll take care of it.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.019
[grunting in pain]

27:35.988 --> 27:37.121
[groans]

27:39.058 --> 27:40.691
[panting]

27:43.129 --> 27:44.461
[screams]

27:45.564 --> 27:46.830
[installer] She'll be
close by.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.039
[panting softly]

28:08.688 --> 28:10.788
[groaning]

28:17.963 --> 28:19.963
[breathing heavily]

28:45.424 --> 28:47.424

29:05.778 --> 29:06.777

29:41.313 --> 29:42.613
[whimpering]

29:51.257 --> 29:53.056

29:53.626 --> 29:56.560
[moans]

30:01.500 --> 30:03.200
[breathing heavily]

30:05.371 --> 30:06.603
Is it done?

30:14.246 --> 30:15.245
[yells]

30:17.316 --> 30:19.783
[gasping, whimpering]

30:29.028 --> 30:30.327
[keypad beeping]

30:31.831 --> 30:33.530
[line ringing]

30:34.700 --> 30:36.533
[dispatcher] <i> 911.</i>
<i> What's your emergency?</i>

30:43.075 --> 30:44.808
[telephone ringing]

30:45.811 --> 30:47.211
[receptionist]
Newbury Veterinary Clinic.

30:49.782 --> 30:53.217
Dr. Campbell, I have
Officer Wilson on the line.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.918
Thanks, you can
put her through.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.422
[telephone rings]

31:00.326 --> 31:01.792
Hello, this is Dr. Campbell.

31:01.794 --> 31:03.460
<i> Dr. Campbell,</i>
<i> this is Officer Wilson</i>

31:03.562 --> 31:05.429
<i> from the Wesmar</i>
<i> Police Department calling.</i>

31:05.431 --> 31:06.897
Yes, I was expecting
your call.

31:06.899 --> 31:07.965
How can I help?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.199
<i> Can I send one of my team do</i>

31:09.201 --> 31:11.702
<i> to collect the fingers</i>
<i> retrieved from the Doberman</i>

31:11.770 --> 31:13.303
Yes, I've got them ready f...

31:14.240 --> 31:15.205
Um.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.507
Can you give me a minute?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.009
<i> Sure.</i>

31:41.800 --> 31:45.135
This is embarrassing but, uh,

31:46.305 --> 31:47.638
I don't see them here.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.340
It's possible one of my
other staff members

31:50.442 --> 31:52.442
could've disposed of them.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.411
<i> Can you check with the staff</i>

31:54.980 --> 31:56.213
Yeah, um, you know what?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.615
I'll ask around
and I'll call you
right back, okay?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.250
<i> Be sure to call</i>
<i> as soon as you can.</i>

32:00.252 --> 32:01.318
Will do. Thank you.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.829
[drill whirring]

32:24.810 --> 32:27.411
Come on.
Do you want a treat?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.046
Yeah, let's go
get you a treat.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.014
Come on.
Come on, let's go get them.

32:33.218 --> 32:36.520
Yeah, let's get you a treat.
Come on.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.222
[laughs] Come on. Come here.
Come get it.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.126
Do you want to go for a walk?
Come on.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.428
Come on. Come on.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.406
All right, that was
<i> The Choking Doberman,</i>

32:56.408 --> 32:58.709
one of my favorite
urban legends.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.744
I'm here with the director,
Ethan Evans.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.546
Welcome, Ethan.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.847
Thank you so much.

33:03.949 --> 33:07.918
The Choking Doberman really
is the classic urban legend

33:07.920 --> 33:09.953
in that, everybody heard it
growing up

33:09.955 --> 33:12.856
and everybody swore they knew
someone that had happened to.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.424
Had you heard
this urban legend?

33:14.426 --> 33:17.194
And if not, what interested
you in this particular story?

33:17.196 --> 33:19.863
I hadn't actually
heard of it before
until I read it.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.565
And it was one of those
perfect scenarios,

33:21.600 --> 33:22.666
as you do with urban legends,

33:22.668 --> 33:24.801
where you read it,
and you just get shivers.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.204
I've got shivers now
thinking about it, honestly.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.106
And it's like
one of the classic things

33:29.108 --> 33:30.674
where it's that twist
at the end

33:30.676 --> 33:32.242
that you just think, "Oh, no."

33:32.311 --> 33:34.144
And you feel so vulnerable
reading it, right?

33:34.246 --> 33:36.313
'Cause you almost feel like
it's in your house.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.614
It's the,
when a stranger calls,

33:37.716 --> 33:39.683
-the killers calling
from inside your house.
-Yeah.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.218
-The <i> Black Christmas</i>  as wel.
-Yeah.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.319
It's exactly that.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.621
<i> And that's such a pleasure</i>
<i> to work in.</i>

33:44.623 --> 33:47.024
<i> Bringing that kind of twist</i>
<i> to life is so exciting.</i>

33:54.733 --> 33:56.499
[pings]

33:59.738 --> 34:02.806
[Ethan] <i> It's the idea</i>
<i> that you hear this,</i>
<i> and it feels so vulnerable,</i>

34:02.808 --> 34:05.042
like, this could happen
to you, you know?

34:05.110 --> 34:06.309
And I think
it's one of those ones

34:06.311 --> 34:08.412
where, you know,
you turn off the lights

34:08.414 --> 34:09.946
and you still think about it.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.416
You still think,
"Is someone in my house,"
kind of thing.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.751
Also, there's an element
to it where...

34:15.621 --> 34:17.120
Everybody's been robbed,

34:17.122 --> 34:19.923
everyone's had someone
break into their house.

34:19.925 --> 34:22.626
And the moment
you see a footprint

34:22.694 --> 34:25.529
or something's out of place
that shouldn't be,

34:25.531 --> 34:27.731
that cold chill that you get,

34:27.733 --> 34:29.299
it's like, and you break
into that sweat

34:29.301 --> 34:30.434
and your heart starts racing.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.536
"Someone was in my house.

34:32.604 --> 34:33.904
What's been taken?

34:33.906 --> 34:35.205
Are they still here?

34:35.207 --> 34:36.206
Are they going to kill me?"

34:36.208 --> 34:38.608
There's some primal thing
that comes out,

34:38.710 --> 34:40.510
where you realize
that five minutes ago,

34:40.512 --> 34:41.711
you were
kicking off your shoes,

34:41.713 --> 34:43.046
or you're in your underwear,

34:43.148 --> 34:45.048
or you're in your house,
you're having a drink,

34:45.150 --> 34:46.149
you're sitting on the couch,

34:46.151 --> 34:47.417
and then, you look
and there's a footprint,

34:47.419 --> 34:49.252
and you realize
that someone's in there.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.021
And could be watching you.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.856
It's so, so freaky.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.791
Right? It's terrifying.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.693
It's, honestly,
it keeps me up at night.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.795
I don't believe
in ghosts or, or, or...

34:58.797 --> 35:00.163
I suppose, like,

35:00.165 --> 35:02.199
you know, my house is pretty,
it's impossible to break in

35:02.201 --> 35:03.934
'cause I live so high up
on the apartment.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.770
But every night,
I think someone's in my house,
you know?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.505
<i> It's terrifying,</i>
<i> 'cause, like you said,</i>

35:08.507 --> 35:10.307
<i> you see one thing out of pla</i>
<i> and you think,</i>
<i> "Did I leave that there?"</i>

35:21.153 --> 35:22.752
[breathing heavily]

35:28.193 --> 35:30.060
Talk about that central scare.

35:30.129 --> 35:34.564
I mean, one of the things
that's difficult
in an urban legend

35:34.633 --> 35:36.933
is dragging it out
to half an hour

35:37.035 --> 35:38.201
so it doesn't feel
like it's dragged out.

35:38.203 --> 35:41.905
It's really writing a story
that sustains the tension.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.541
Talk about, kind of,
building up the characters,

35:44.609 --> 35:45.842
having that twist
in the middle,

35:45.911 --> 35:49.112
and then, where the story
goes for the back half.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.847
I think with a lot
of urban legends,

35:50.949 --> 35:52.549
they end on a cliffhanger,
don't they?

35:52.651 --> 35:55.051
And it's, kind of, like,
"Where do we go from there?"

35:55.120 --> 35:57.721
How do we somehow
improve the story?

35:57.723 --> 35:58.955
Or how do we
add an extra twist

35:59.057 --> 36:01.858
that, you know, strengthens
the overall urban legend?

36:01.927 --> 36:03.460
And that was
a very tough one to crack.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.794
But I think we got there
in the end

36:04.796 --> 36:07.063
with the, you know, the twist
of the security installer

36:07.065 --> 36:09.099
and, kind of, bringing
that whole subplot into it.

36:09.101 --> 36:11.835
They've got all our details
and all our security.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.204
The scary thing to think about
is what happens

36:14.206 --> 36:17.374
if one person out of those
billions employees
acted maliciously,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.409
you know,
and that could happen and--

36:19.411 --> 36:23.413
Well, there's also the fear
that the police aren't going
to show up, that...

36:23.415 --> 36:26.349
We think the police,
this protective force,
but they're just reactionary.

36:26.451 --> 36:29.319
The idea that people pay
all this money
to have security put in,

36:29.321 --> 36:32.522
that the security installer
is actually
the invading force.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.057
<i> It's another layer</i>
<i> of terrifying.</i>

36:37.129 --> 36:38.661
[softly] Okay.

36:38.663 --> 36:42.933
So I've installed sensors
on all the ground floor doors
and windows.

36:42.935 --> 36:46.336
The smart lock controls
the front door access,

36:46.438 --> 36:48.038
and you can arm
the whole system

36:48.040 --> 36:50.073
from your tablet or phone
with just the click
of a button.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.309
[chuckles] That's amazing.
Thank you.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.677
Did you have any problems
downloading the app?

36:53.679 --> 36:54.945
Uh, no, no.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.613
Okay, well let's
take a look here.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.415
So if you just hit
the slider there

36:58.417 --> 36:59.849
-that says front door.
-Mmm-hmm.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.852
[beeps, lock clicks]

37:03.989 --> 37:05.422
I know, right?

37:05.424 --> 37:07.023
And I think that's something
that was so exciting
to bring to life,

37:07.025 --> 37:11.361
was the idea that someone
could invest in, in something
to keep them safe.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.464
And very early on,
from a story perspective
that got me so excited,

37:14.499 --> 37:17.400
the idea that that could
ironically backfire.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.003
Imagine if you were trapped
inside your home now
with a killer

37:20.005 --> 37:23.039
and, you know, all the ideas
you could get from there.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.776
The very first thing
I visualized when I read
the urban legend

37:26.778 --> 37:29.212
was the idea
that she'd read this text,

37:29.214 --> 37:30.447
it would be terrifying.

37:30.515 --> 37:31.514
And then her eyes
would adjust,

37:31.516 --> 37:33.250
you know,
to the blood on the floor.

37:33.318 --> 37:36.519
She'd look up
and there's a pitch black,
sort of, closet there.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.355
And the idea that
something's looking at you is,

37:38.423 --> 37:40.257
-just, it gave me shivers.
-Yeah.

37:53.205 --> 37:54.704
No. No. No.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.047
Where is it?

38:08.220 --> 38:10.220
[breathing heavily]

38:10.222 --> 38:12.055
[Eli] <i> There's also</i>
<i> something here with our pets</i>

38:12.057 --> 38:14.124
I mean, I have a, a dog,
a French bulldog,

38:14.126 --> 38:16.526
And every time she coughs,
I panic,

38:16.528 --> 38:18.228
'cause they can't communicate.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.063
And they're just... [choking]

38:20.131 --> 38:22.399
So there is something about,
like, wanting to help your pet

38:22.401 --> 38:24.601
and rushing to the vet
not knowing what's wrong.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.703
It's like there's
two levels of anxiety.

38:26.705 --> 38:30.206
And then you find out
that your friend, your pet,
was defending you

38:30.208 --> 38:32.008
and that actually
bit someone's fingers off.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.810
-Yeah.
-The Choking Doberman,

38:33.812 --> 38:36.012
what I love about it is,
it's such an absurd idea.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.814
<i> Like, someone got their</i>
<i> fingers cut off,</i>

38:37.816 --> 38:39.149
<i> and they're still</i>
<i> hiding in your house,</i>

38:39.250 --> 38:41.050
<i> but that's also the fun of i</i>

38:41.052 --> 38:43.153
<i> 'cause you're, like,</i>
<i> "Yeah, no, that that is real</i>
<i> That could happen."</i>

38:43.254 --> 38:45.455
<i> They're in there hiding,</i>
<i> waiting for you to leave.</i>

38:45.524 --> 38:46.523
[footsteps approaching]

38:49.761 --> 38:51.761
[man breathing heavily]

38:56.001 --> 38:57.500
Do you have pets?
Did you, like--

38:57.502 --> 38:59.135
I did have a cat.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.404
And it's, like you say,
sometimes you have a bond
with it more than a human.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.872
You're there to protect them,

39:02.874 --> 39:05.508
and it really is terrifying
'cause it's like that
language barrier

39:05.510 --> 39:07.811
where you can't understand
sometimes what's wrong.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.046
It's amazing for tension
as well in this story

39:10.115 --> 39:13.650
because it doesn't take long
for you to form a connection
with the dog,

39:13.652 --> 39:14.918
it ramped up the conflict.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.519
Had you worked
with animals before?

39:16.521 --> 39:19.122
I worked with a dog once
and it was...

39:19.124 --> 39:21.624
We worked with a dog
on a horror project.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.927
And it was so scary
because every now and then,

39:23.929 --> 39:26.629
it would bark so loudly,
and make everyone jump.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.532
So it was perfect
for a horror set,
'cause everyone was on edge.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.301
How was it this time
working with the Doberman?

39:31.303 --> 39:32.669
It was good. It was like...

39:32.671 --> 39:35.672
I was surprised, he was such
a well behaved dog, you know?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.207
<i> He was so sweet.</i>

39:37.209 --> 39:40.143
We'll keep him here tonight
and run an X-ray
just to be sure,

39:40.245 --> 39:42.612
but I'm not too worried.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.115
-Max is a really strong dog.
-[sighs]

39:45.117 --> 39:47.517
We'll text you tomorrow
when he's ready
to be collected, okay?

39:48.053 --> 39:49.719
Okay. Thank you.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.055
[Ethan] <i> They always say,</i>
<i> you know,</i>
<i> never work with animals.</i>

39:52.124 --> 39:54.457
And it's always a challenge
because sometimes,
they like to do,

39:54.526 --> 39:56.626
you know,
whatever they like to do.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.262
But yeah, we got what we
needed from the dog,

39:59.331 --> 40:01.965
which was a pleasure
and it didn't bark once,
so that was good.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.800
I mean, the big question is,

40:03.802 --> 40:06.503
you go, "Okay, I'm going to
direct <i> The Choking Doberman.</i>

40:06.505 --> 40:08.805
Your next question is,
"Well, how do I
get a dog to choke

40:08.807 --> 40:13.476
without actually, how do you
get a dog to act choking?
Sound like..."

40:13.478 --> 40:14.610
What was your
approach to that?

40:14.612 --> 40:17.213
'Cause you can't, obviously,
do that to an animal.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.115
Um, but how did you
approach that?

40:19.117 --> 40:21.618
'Cause it's, literally,
The Choking Doberman,
so how did you do that?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.119
Well, our plan
was to, kind of,

40:23.121 --> 40:24.888
put peanut butter
in the dog's mouth,

40:24.890 --> 40:28.691
which would be sticky enough
that it would be trying to,
you know, get it out.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.394
And then, we got to set,
and it turned out,
someone had a peanut allergy.

40:31.396 --> 40:32.695
So we had to scrap that

40:32.697 --> 40:35.298
-and think
on our feet, basically.
-Wow.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.000
So what they
ended up doing was

40:37.002 --> 40:39.702
we, kind of,
rubbed loads
of butter in treats

40:39.704 --> 40:41.805
and tried to get little
pieces of the dog moving

40:41.807 --> 40:43.206
just to, kind of,
piece that together,

40:43.208 --> 40:45.909
<i> and also playing a lot</i>
<i> with the sound design.</i>

40:45.911 --> 40:47.677
<i> With horror,</i>
<i> sound is everything.</i>

40:48.413 --> 40:49.813
-[coughs]
-Max.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.848
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

40:51.916 --> 40:53.349
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

40:53.418 --> 40:55.218
Hey, it's okay, buddy,
what's wrong?

40:55.220 --> 40:56.453
Max, hey.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.021
[Ethan] <i> When you watch it</i>
<i> with sound on,</i>

40:58.023 --> 41:01.224
and the final product,
it makes it
so distressing, right?

41:01.226 --> 41:02.358
He couldn't have been happier.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.327
-Exactly.
-You're just feeding
the dog treats.

41:04.329 --> 41:05.728
-He had the best day ever.
-[munching]

41:05.730 --> 41:08.097
-[laughs]
-And then you put in
the sound effects,

41:08.099 --> 41:11.201
and you can CGI a little,
you know, blood cough
or something.

41:11.203 --> 41:14.304
Exactly and I think it's all,
that's the beauty of horror.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.539
They're the best sets
to be on, everyone's happy.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.942
But it's so much
about manipulating
what the audience sees.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.443
And that was very much
what we did here

41:20.479 --> 41:22.612
with loads of
little techniques like that.

41:22.714 --> 41:27.317
Yeah, I find I'm most happy
and excited when I'm going
to do a major kill scene.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.718
I mean, anxious, but I'm like,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.620
it was like, "Oh, you're
really engaged today."

41:30.722 --> 41:31.688
-[excited] Aah.
-[chuckles]

41:31.690 --> 41:32.956
Do you find you're like that,
or is it just,

41:32.958 --> 41:34.624
you keep it even keel
for every scene?

41:34.726 --> 41:35.859
I am exactly
the same with you.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.061
Like, for me,
the thing that gets me going

41:38.063 --> 41:40.463
-is the pillar scare scenes.
-Yes.

41:40.499 --> 41:41.865
Especially,
in the ghostly sense.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.300
So with <i> The Choking Doberman</i>
it was that reveal

41:44.936 --> 41:46.302
of someone's in the house.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.605
And I guess the fun with this

41:48.607 --> 41:50.740
was figuring out
loads of little scares,

41:50.809 --> 41:53.076
that, like you said, sustain
across the whole thing.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.410
-It's great story.
-Yeah.

41:54.412 --> 41:56.412
It's a great story and you did
an amazing job with it.

41:56.414 --> 41:57.614
Thank you so much.
