Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:06.055 --> 00:07.221
Yesterday while
we were in Florida,

00:07.223 --> 00:08.489
a body was found
in the desert

00:08.506 --> 00:10.038
outside Las Cruces,
New Mexico.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.673
A man
had his leg amputated

00:11.675 --> 00:13.774
and replaced with
the leg of someone else.

00:13.874 --> 00:16.158
Someone's out there
mimicking the crimes we've solved.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.218
This is now an active case,
which we'll be investigating

00:18.243 --> 00:19.495
along with our other cases.

00:19.496 --> 00:20.796
Hello, I'm still here.

00:20.798 --> 00:22.380
Zug...Zwang.

00:22.382 --> 00:24.349
It's a chess term.
It describes the point in the game

00:24.351 --> 00:27.519
when a player realizes
he'll inevitably be checkmated.

00:27.521 --> 00:29.304
Both the Director
and the Attorney-General

00:29.306 --> 00:30.856
want to take you
off this case.

00:30.858 --> 00:33.024
We know this case
better than anyone.

00:33.026 --> 00:34.943
Guess what just came
to the reception desk

00:34.945 --> 00:36.194
for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.

00:36.196 --> 00:38.363
Who sent it?
Zugzwang.

00:38.365 --> 00:39.564
They knew you would be
at that phone booth.

00:39.566 --> 00:40.866
What if this
is the Replicator?

00:40.868 --> 00:42.701
The original zugzwang taunt
was directed at me.

00:42.703 --> 00:45.287
If it's directed at one of us,
it's directed at all of us.

00:45.289 --> 00:46.404
First he was chasing us,

00:46.406 --> 00:48.990
and now it's our turn
to chase him.

00:48.992 --> 00:51.409
This psychopath's message
is clearly personal.

00:51.411 --> 00:53.411
You're victims now.

00:53.413 --> 00:55.463
I had a meeting
with the Director.

00:55.465 --> 00:57.382
You have no fresh leads.

00:57.384 --> 00:59.384
He wants the Replicator
classified inactive.

00:59.386 --> 01:00.886
Erin, he's stalking
this team.

01:00.888 --> 01:02.003
No one's going
to give it up.

01:02.005 --> 01:03.054
I know that.

01:03.056 --> 01:04.589
And neither will I.

Hey, Hotch,
I need an override.

01:28.165 --> 01:29.748
Hotch!

01:29.750 --> 01:32.150
I told you not
to all me that.

01:32.152 --> 01:33.618
I need an override.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.253
I can't help you.
Thane's got the card.

01:35.255 --> 01:36.371
You know where he is?

01:36.373 --> 01:38.840
I'll give you one guess.

01:42.829 --> 01:46.298
You're too hot.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.800
Oh, God.

01:48.802 --> 01:50.936
Mmm...

01:50.938 --> 01:52.187
I'm thirsty.

01:52.189 --> 01:55.473
I think
you've had enough.

01:55.475 --> 01:57.859
Is it hot in here?

01:57.861 --> 01:59.227
Oh, yeah, it is.

01:59.229 --> 02:01.863
You're too hot.

02:04.516 --> 02:05.951
Who's that?

02:05.953 --> 02:08.119
Shh.

02:09.205 --> 02:10.205
Thane?

02:10.207 --> 02:13.241
What do you want, Hotchner?

02:13.243 --> 02:14.993
I need the override card.

02:14.995 --> 02:16.661
Yeah, I get that.
I'm a little busy.

02:16.663 --> 02:18.630
It's a 5g tab.
We don't want 'em to walk.

02:18.632 --> 02:21.166
Uh, just...

02:25.004 --> 02:26.338
Thought I told you
not to bug me.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.806
I'm not the only one
with a card.

02:27.808 --> 02:28.840
Jim's in a meeting.

02:28.842 --> 02:29.808
What meeting?

02:29.810 --> 02:30.842
I don't know.
A meeting.

02:30.844 --> 02:33.645
You got the card
or what?

02:35.982 --> 02:37.649
I need some water.

02:37.651 --> 02:39.851
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

02:41.654 --> 02:42.737
Bloody hell!

02:42.739 --> 02:46.491
I don't feel so good.

02:52.115 --> 02:54.749
Sean! Sean, get in here!

02:54.751 --> 02:57.235
What the hell did this?

02:57.237 --> 02:58.753
Call 911!

03:00.906 --> 03:02.007
She's not breathing.

03:02.009 --> 03:05.093
What the hell are you doing?
Call for help!

03:08.881 --> 03:11.416
I do not.

03:11.418 --> 03:12.467
Ok, you don't.

03:12.469 --> 03:13.668
Do I, really?

03:13.670 --> 03:14.936
Well, just a little.
And I'm used to it,

03:14.938 --> 03:16.972
'cause Jack can babble
all night long in his sleep.

03:16.974 --> 03:18.523
Usually he's talking about
superheroes, though.

03:18.525 --> 03:20.025
What do I talk about?

03:20.027 --> 03:21.559
Mm, you don't want to know.

03:21.561 --> 03:22.560
Aaron!

03:22.562 --> 03:24.112
Shh. He just got to sleep.

03:25.532 --> 03:27.365
I'm so glad we're
finally doing this.

03:27.367 --> 03:28.283
Me, too.

03:28.285 --> 03:29.818
I cannot wait
to show him the city.

03:29.820 --> 03:30.986
He's so excited.

03:30.988 --> 03:33.038
Mm. What did you think
of my itinerary?

03:33.040 --> 03:35.440
Um, which page?

03:35.442 --> 03:38.043
Oh...I went all
overboard, didn't I?

03:38.045 --> 03:39.544
It's a little ambitious.

03:39.546 --> 03:40.829
That's ok.

03:40.831 --> 03:43.798
We'll take it easy
and play it by ear, ok?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.133
Mm.

03:45.135 --> 03:46.551
We'll play it by this ear.

03:46.553 --> 03:47.886
Oh. This one?

03:47.888 --> 03:49.554
Mm-hmm.

03:49.556 --> 03:51.289
I just--I really
want this weekend

03:51.291 --> 03:53.641
to be memorable
for both of you.

03:53.643 --> 03:55.927
It already is.

03:55.929 --> 03:59.647
It's hard not living
in the same city.

03:59.649 --> 04:02.600
I know. But I think
we're making it work. Right?

04:02.602 --> 04:04.436
I think we are.

04:04.438 --> 04:08.106
Did you forget to tell
Dave that you were on vacation?

04:08.108 --> 04:09.824
It's Sean.

04:09.826 --> 04:12.310
Your brother Sean?

04:13.496 --> 04:16.314
Jim Peters.
I own the place.

04:16.315 --> 04:19.750
Aaron, uh, thank God.
Uh...

04:19.753 --> 04:22.337
I got mixed up in something.
I need your help.

04:22.339 --> 04:23.455
What happened?

04:23.457 --> 04:26.341
This girl, she died
right in my arms.

04:26.343 --> 04:28.093
Look, I need to see you.

04:28.095 --> 04:30.678
Sean, if you're a witness
to something, you need to stay put.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.014
I'm in Manhattan.
I'll come to you.

04:33.016 --> 04:34.716
What, you're here?
Since when?

04:34.718 --> 04:35.900
Where are you?

04:35.902 --> 04:38.970
Club called the Edinburgh.
8th and 54th.

04:38.972 --> 04:41.356
All right, I'm on my way.
I'll text you when I'm close.

04:43.559 --> 04:44.976
That sounded serious.

04:44.978 --> 04:46.478
Yeah, with Sean
it usually is.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.629
What's going on?

04:47.631 --> 04:48.863
I don't know.

04:48.865 --> 04:50.014
I'll keep you posted.

04:50.016 --> 04:52.150
Will you keep
an eye on Jack?

04:52.152 --> 04:53.318
Of course.

04:55.538 --> 04:56.905
I'm sorry.

04:56.907 --> 04:58.406
Don't be.

04:58.408 --> 05:00.024
He's your brother.

05:00.026 --> 05:03.495
Yeah.
That's why I'm worried.

I didn't think you could
still smoke in New York.

05:25.385 --> 05:28.903
You're not even gonna warm up to
the big brother act?

05:28.905 --> 05:30.822
I figured it'd save us time.

05:30.824 --> 05:33.908
How long you been
in the city?

05:33.910 --> 05:35.360
Jack and I got here today.

05:35.362 --> 05:38.329
Jack. Wow.

05:38.331 --> 05:39.914
I haven't seen him
since he was...

05:39.916 --> 05:41.032
3.

05:41.034 --> 05:43.568
Right.
And now he's, uh...

05:43.570 --> 05:44.919
7.
3.

05:46.372 --> 05:48.706
So this is where
you work now?

05:48.708 --> 05:50.842
What happened
to the restaurant?

05:50.844 --> 05:53.044
That was a long time ago.

05:53.046 --> 05:55.296
I'm a bartender now.

05:55.298 --> 05:56.848
What happened tonight?

05:56.850 --> 05:59.134
The girl who died, Anna,

05:59.136 --> 06:01.519
cops think she O.D.'d
on Ecstasy.

06:01.521 --> 06:03.754
And you think
they're wrong?

06:03.756 --> 06:07.308
She--she was bleeding,

06:07.310 --> 06:09.093
out of everything.

06:09.095 --> 06:11.529
My manager
wouldn't let me

06:11.531 --> 06:13.281
call 911 until
we got her outside,

06:13.283 --> 06:15.650
and by that time
she was already dead.

06:15.652 --> 06:17.935
Cops ask you why
you waited to call them?

06:17.937 --> 06:19.904
They'd already
written it off.

06:19.906 --> 06:22.407
Cops said they see people
overdose in clubs all the time.

06:22.409 --> 06:25.109
Then there are probably other
cases like this. I'll talk to them.

06:25.111 --> 06:27.829
There was.

06:27.831 --> 06:29.780
Linda Heying.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.799
She died last week.

06:35.004 --> 06:36.304
How well did you know her?

06:36.306 --> 06:38.806
We worked together.

06:38.808 --> 06:42.594
She probably got her supply
from the same place.

06:42.596 --> 06:44.128
There's enough of it
around here.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.764
And everybody looks
the other way.

06:46.766 --> 06:49.484
Yeah. If we want
to keep our jobs.

06:49.486 --> 06:51.636
Linda wasn't using.

06:51.638 --> 06:53.655
How do you know?

06:53.657 --> 06:56.307
She was my girlfriend.

06:59.695 --> 07:01.979
And the M.E. reports showed
3 other victims

07:01.981 --> 07:03.147
bleeding out over the last week.

07:03.149 --> 07:05.083
Yeah. One in Harlem,
two in the Village,

07:05.085 --> 07:08.953
all 5 of them categorized
as Ecstasy overdoses.

07:08.955 --> 07:11.823
And one of the victims may have
been drugged without her knowledge.

07:11.825 --> 07:14.158
Ecstasy is frequently
used as a date rape drug,

07:14.160 --> 07:16.127
but I've never seen it
cause bleeding like this.

07:16.129 --> 07:17.345
Could it be a bad batch?

07:17.347 --> 07:18.329
Well, uh,

07:18.331 --> 07:19.664
according to the M.E.,

07:19.666 --> 07:22.133
the victims had so much
MDMA in their systems

07:22.135 --> 07:24.727
that it caused their
internal body temperature

07:24.752 --> 07:26.505
to go out of control.

07:26.506 --> 07:29.507
They boiled
from the inside out.

07:29.509 --> 07:32.677
That's not typical
of overdose victims either.

07:32.679 --> 07:34.679
We could be looking
at product tampering,

07:34.681 --> 07:37.732
similar to the Tylenol
cyanide poisoning in '86.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.367
And the working theory
in that case

07:39.369 --> 07:41.920
was that the unsub
targeted a specific victim

07:41.922 --> 07:43.854
but dosed mass quantities
to cover his tracks.

07:43.856 --> 07:45.990
So you're telling me these
deaths could just be the start.

07:45.992 --> 07:47.100
Yes, ma'am. I'd like the team

07:47.125 --> 07:48.690
to join me in New York
as soon as possible.

07:48.712 --> 07:50.211
We're on our way, Aaron.

07:50.213 --> 07:51.512
Thanks.

07:52.531 --> 07:54.198
You're coming, aren't you?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.550
Just as a precaution.

07:55.552 --> 07:59.203

loved ones are involved.

Overdosing certainly

his victims without

09:42.462 --> 09:43.553

Ecstasy can be made in pill,

It wouldn't be that hard to slip
something into someone's drink

they're being dosed

Why kill in such
a graphic manner?

09:55.653 --> 09:57.987

He incites fear.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.995
Which means the unsub
is desperate for attention,

10:05.997 --> 10:07.479
and he wants all eyes

10:07.481 --> 10:09.147
because he craves recognition.

10:09.149 --> 10:11.367
He'll  be paying close attention
to the media, then.

10:11.369 --> 10:13.619
It allows him
to relive his crimes.

10:13.621 --> 10:15.454

10:18.259 --> 10:20.793
It's like he wants to take
that happiness away.

10:20.795 --> 10:22.261
Well, it can't be
a coincidence

10:22.263 --> 10:23.629
that the majority is
victims are known drug users.

10:23.631 --> 10:25.764
He's taking the law
into his own hands.

10:25.766 --> 10:27.933
But what about
the two who were clean?

10:27.935 --> 10:29.668
Linda Heying and
Erik Sullivan's families

10:29.670 --> 10:31.603
insist they never
touched the stuff.

10:31.605 --> 10:34.172
Either the victims
are good at hiding the truth

10:34.174 --> 10:35.858
or the unsub's killing
for another reason.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.694
We should take a closer look
and see how they're connected.

10:43.483 --> 10:46.368
Hi. I'm gonna have to try
to meet up with you guys later.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.320
This is a bit of a mess.

10:48.322 --> 10:49.655
We've got 11 victims,

10:49.657 --> 10:51.707
and Sean seems to be
mixed up in it somehow.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.709
Well, don't worry about us,
then. We'll be fine.

10:53.711 --> 10:55.411
Ok. Can you put Jack on?

10:55.413 --> 10:57.546
Sure.

10:57.548 --> 10:59.548
It's your dad.

11:00.383 --> 11:01.867
Hi, Dad.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.169
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna
have to be late.

11:04.171 --> 11:05.804
You'll miss
the Statue of Liberty.

11:05.806 --> 11:07.556
I know. And I'm really
disappointed.

11:07.558 --> 11:10.092
I was looking forward
to the boat ride out there.

11:10.094 --> 11:12.043
I'm sorry I have to work, Jack.

11:12.045 --> 11:14.646
This is the part of my job
that stinks.

11:14.648 --> 11:16.732
It's ok, Dad.
If someone's in trouble,

11:16.734 --> 11:18.167
you should help them.

11:18.169 --> 11:21.937
I appreciate that. Take lots
of pictures for me, ok?

11:21.939 --> 11:23.555
I will.

11:25.525 --> 11:26.725
Hey.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.826
Hi.

11:27.828 --> 11:29.895
Thanks for doing this.
I'm really sorry.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.580
Oh, are you kidding?

11:31.582 --> 11:34.366
I'm excited about a little quality
one-on-one with Jack.

11:34.368 --> 11:36.535
Go help your brother.

11:36.537 --> 11:38.120
Thanks. I love you.

11:38.122 --> 11:40.589
Love you, too.

11:40.591 --> 11:42.374
Bye.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.130
6 kids died
at a rave last night.

11:48.132 --> 11:49.681
They bled out
just like the others.

11:49.683 --> 11:51.350
Damn.

11:51.352 --> 11:53.051
How well do you know these people
you're working with?

11:53.053 --> 11:57.088
Oh...Thane hooked me up
with the job a couple of months ago.

11:57.090 --> 11:59.858
Linda and I started dating
a few weeks after that.

11:59.860 --> 12:02.444
You suspect any of
the employees of dealing?

12:02.446 --> 12:05.531
No, but it's not like it's hard
to find if you're looking.

12:05.533 --> 12:08.784
And you'd tell me if you
were involved in anything illegal?

12:08.786 --> 12:10.602
Yes, but I'm not.

12:11.755 --> 12:13.572
I swear, Aaron.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.741
And you've told me
everything?

12:16.910 --> 12:19.595
All right, you did
the right thing in calling.

12:19.597 --> 12:21.630
I'll you know
what we find out.

12:32.725 --> 12:34.676
Well, this guy's definitely
making a statement.

12:34.678 --> 12:39.231
To us or to them?

12:39.233 --> 12:40.649
It's the drug.

12:40.651 --> 12:44.302
Did you and your friends
take the same pills?

12:44.304 --> 12:47.172
Yeah. But it wasn't pills.
It was liquid X.

12:47.174 --> 12:51.994
I'm just trying
to understand

12:51.996 --> 12:55.247
did they take
a lot more than you?

12:55.249 --> 12:58.784
Why was that?

12:58.786 --> 13:00.252
Why would you want
more doses?

13:00.254 --> 13:03.005
I mean, it appears that
the drug had its intended effect.

13:03.007 --> 13:04.623
Eventually, yeah.

13:04.625 --> 13:07.342
But it took forever and the
others didn't want to wait.

13:07.344 --> 13:09.011
And how long
does it normally take?

13:09.013 --> 13:10.345
An hour, maybe.

13:10.347 --> 13:11.630
But is stuff
was different.

13:11.632 --> 13:13.015
It took nearly
double that.

13:13.017 --> 13:14.783
So your friends
bought more doses,

13:14.785 --> 13:16.768
thinking the batch
they'd taken was weak.

13:16.770 --> 13:19.104
How much more did
they take? Do you know?

13:19.106 --> 13:21.106
Two vials, each.

13:21.108 --> 13:23.025
Do you think you'd be able to
describe the person

13:23.027 --> 13:24.509
you bought
the Ecstasy from?

13:24.511 --> 13:25.527
Don't have to.

13:25.529 --> 13:28.864
He's right over there.

13:31.484 --> 13:32.868
Thanks.

13:33.255 --> 13:36.497
The delayed onset of the drug
caused the victims to OD themselves.

13:36.574 --> 13:38.323
Well, that explains
why the victims boiled.

13:38.325 --> 13:39.942
The higher the dose,
the higher the heat.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.376
Maybe it was designed
that way.

13:41.378 --> 13:42.794
According to the M.E.
report,

13:42.796 --> 13:46.031
the Ecstasy was cut with a
high volume of methamphetamine.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.633
Go for greatness.

13:47.635 --> 13:49.534
Hey, baby girl.
I need you to run a search

13:49.536 --> 13:50.869
on delayed onset MDMA.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.138
Meth amphetamine mixtures.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.673
See if you can find
anything about--

13:54.675 --> 13:55.841
Whoa?
What?

13:55.843 --> 13:58.310
Double oh to the whoa
to the oh whoa power.

13:58.312 --> 14:00.512
There's a drug called
para-methox...ish...

14:00.514 --> 14:02.681
Para-methoxymethamphetamine?

14:02.683 --> 14:05.100
Yes. What you just said.
PMMA for short.

14:05.102 --> 14:06.568
It just hit
the international market.

14:06.570 --> 14:09.271
Its street name, which I'm
not making up, is Doctor Death.

14:09.273 --> 14:11.823
So coined because
the drug keeps killing people.

14:11.825 --> 14:14.359
Apparently it's produced
with such a huge percentage of meth,

14:14.361 --> 14:16.495
it masks the effects
of the Ecstasy

14:16.497 --> 14:18.413
until the user's
already taken too much.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.398
MDMA costs more to make
than methamphetamine,

14:20.400 --> 14:23.335
so it's common practice
to mix the two in creating Ecstasy

14:23.337 --> 14:24.836
in order to maximize
the profit margins.

14:24.838 --> 14:26.288
Like watering down
liquor,

14:26.290 --> 14:29.207
except in this case,
the water kills you.

14:29.209 --> 14:31.710
So is this PMMA coming
straight from the manufacturer,

14:31.712 --> 14:34.882
or is our unsub altering the
drug supply to make it more lethal?

14:55.151 --> 14:56.535
Thank you.

14:56.537 --> 14:57.736
That was the DEA.

14:57.738 --> 14:59.237
They're very concerned.

14:59.239 --> 15:00.656
This is the first evidence

15:00.658 --> 15:03.441
of PMMA making its way
into the United States.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.294
And they have no idea
this is where it's coming from?

15:05.296 --> 15:07.296
No. They've increased
border patrol,

15:07.298 --> 15:09.414
they've heightened security
at the airports.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.083
That doesn't help us
if it's being made here.

15:11.085 --> 15:12.784
Well, still, if it weren't
for your brother,

15:12.786 --> 15:14.586
we might not have made
the connection.

15:16.973 --> 15:19.641
I have some reservations.

15:19.643 --> 15:21.093
What are you gonna do?

15:21.095 --> 15:23.378
I asked Dave
to talk to him.

15:25.932 --> 15:28.299
Well, that'll do it.

15:28.301 --> 15:30.802
Where's Aaron?

15:30.804 --> 15:33.155
In cases where
family's involved,

15:33.157 --> 15:35.157
we like to have
an unbiased agent

15:35.159 --> 15:37.109
conduct the interview.

15:39.145 --> 15:40.362
Am I a suspect?

15:40.364 --> 15:42.831
Should you be?

15:45.018 --> 15:47.703
Um, how well
did you know Linda?

15:47.705 --> 15:49.838
We used to date.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.340
Date?

15:51.342 --> 15:53.842
Hmm.

15:53.844 --> 15:57.346
You told Agent Hotchner
that she was your girlfriend.

15:57.348 --> 15:58.680
She was.

15:58.682 --> 16:00.665
Then it...stopped.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.434
You two broke up, then?

16:02.436 --> 16:04.019
No, it's not like that.

16:04.021 --> 16:05.670
Well, what stopped, then,
the sex?

16:05.672 --> 16:08.857
Look, what Linda and I were
or weren't isn't gonna help you.

16:08.859 --> 16:11.393
I think you should let me
decide what's going to help.

16:13.346 --> 16:14.679
We had a fight.

16:14.681 --> 16:16.615
It was bad.
But we were getting over it,

16:16.617 --> 16:18.033
getting back
to normal.

16:18.035 --> 16:20.302
What was the fight about?

16:24.158 --> 16:25.690
My using.

16:25.692 --> 16:26.825
You're a drug addict?

16:26.827 --> 16:28.377
I don't use anymore.

16:28.379 --> 16:30.996
Linda convinced me
to get clean.

16:30.998 --> 16:32.664
How long ago was that?

16:32.666 --> 16:34.166
Two months ago.

16:34.168 --> 16:36.134
Any relapses?

16:36.136 --> 16:37.552
Not in the last two months.

16:37.554 --> 16:39.388
What was
your drug of choice?

16:39.390 --> 16:40.555
I'd rather not say.

16:40.557 --> 16:42.007
You'd rather not say?

16:42.009 --> 16:45.177
Are you serious?
People are dying, Sean.

16:46.896 --> 16:48.513
It was Ecstasy.

16:48.515 --> 16:49.848
You said you told me
everything.

16:49.850 --> 16:52.150
I stopped using.
I didn't think it mattered.

16:52.152 --> 16:54.486
It does matter. Where were you
getting the drugs?

16:55.905 --> 16:57.239
From Thane.

16:57.241 --> 16:58.556
So you're protecting him.

16:58.558 --> 16:59.775
No. Look,
it's not like that.

16:59.777 --> 17:00.992
I met him
a few years ago.

17:00.994 --> 17:02.861
When I lost the catering gig,
he gave me a job.

17:02.863 --> 17:04.780
Thane may be a dumbass,
but he doesn't kill people.

17:04.781 --> 17:07.565
Does it not occur to you that if
Thane has access to the drug supply,

17:07.567 --> 17:10.035
he might also have access
to the person doing this?

17:12.622 --> 17:14.089
I didn't think--

17:14.090 --> 17:16.208
No, you didn't think.
What else are you hiding?

17:16.210 --> 17:17.459
Nothing!

17:20.096 --> 17:22.130
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.884
I don't understand.

17:25.886 --> 17:28.753
We buried my brother
week ago.

17:28.755 --> 17:33.942
Well, other people have died,
and we're worried

17:33.944 --> 17:35.477
to what happened
to your brother.

17:35.479 --> 17:37.112
I knew it.

17:37.114 --> 17:40.782
The cops tried telling us
he died of a drug overdose.

17:40.784 --> 17:42.100
But you didn't believe them.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.601
Erik didn't do drugs.

17:43.603 --> 17:44.653
He wouldn't.

17:44.655 --> 17:45.821
Why is that?

17:45.823 --> 17:48.990
Our dad used to get high
before he'd beat us.

17:50.776 --> 17:54.212
You told police that you were
partying the night he died.

17:54.214 --> 17:56.131
Yeah, we were just
drinking wine.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.499
That's all.

17:57.501 --> 17:59.284
You remember
what kind?

17:59.286 --> 18:00.802
Not the brand
or anything.

18:00.804 --> 18:04.089
I got a bottle of red,
he got white.

18:09.595 --> 18:12.130
While you're
topping off...

18:14.800 --> 18:16.101
Did you wash your hands?

18:16.103 --> 18:17.269
Yes.

18:18.571 --> 18:20.906
You know the rules.

18:22.742 --> 18:24.827
Thank you for
the world so sweet,

18:24.829 --> 18:26.445
thank you for the food we eat.

18:26.447 --> 18:28.146
Thank you for
the birds that sing,

18:28.148 --> 18:29.665
thank you, God, for everything.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.500
Amen.

18:32.652 --> 18:34.420
Mom! Dad!

18:35.789 --> 18:37.423
Aah!

18:51.621 --> 18:54.755
Ecstasy isn't exactly
an appetizer.

18:56.061 --> 18:59.062
You know, Kimberly
Sullivan said she and her brother

18:59.064 --> 19:00.697
were drinking wine
the night he died.

19:04.085 --> 19:05.201
It's almost empty.

19:05.203 --> 19:08.237
Do you mind?
Thanks.

19:17.798 --> 19:20.016
The unsub wants to increase
his body count.

19:20.018 --> 19:21.468
He doesn't care
who he hurts.

19:21.470 --> 19:23.970
A startling development
tonight in Manhattan

19:23.972 --> 19:25.492
where two parents died
of an apparent drug overdose

19:25.517 --> 19:27.052
in front of their daughter.

19:27.192 --> 19:30.243
Bernard and Catherine Hatchitt
bled out at the dinner table

19:30.245 --> 19:32.836
in what is being categorized
as a deadly reaction

19:32.861 --> 19:35.003
to Ecstasy and methamphetamine.

19:35.334 --> 19:38.535
Federal investigators arrived on
the scene when it was discovered

19:38.537 --> 19:40.670
the illegal substance
was inside the wine

19:40.672 --> 19:42.572
the couple had been drinking.

19:42.574 --> 19:44.341
Their daughter has been moved
into protective custody

19:44.343 --> 19:46.259
pending the outcome
of the investigation,

19:46.261 --> 19:47.711
and next of kin...

19:48.746 --> 19:51.348
I hope you saved me
for dessert.

19:51.350 --> 19:53.383
Morgan isn't here,
baby girl.

19:53.385 --> 19:55.719
Oh. I knew that.
That was for you.

19:55.721 --> 19:56.686
Uh-huh.

19:56.688 --> 19:59.606
Tell us you found
something.

19:59.608 --> 20:01.758
How about a sequel
to "The Grapes of Wrath"?

20:01.760 --> 20:03.143
I tracked the wine bottles
both Erik Sullivan

20:03.145 --> 20:04.811
and the Hatchitt family
were drinking,

20:04.813 --> 20:06.780
and look out, 'cause
those bottles were in cases

20:06.782 --> 20:08.198
shipped to the Edinburgh.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.600
Why would someone
at the bar drug the wine?

20:10.602 --> 20:12.869
Maybe it occurred
at the bottling plant.

20:12.871 --> 20:15.155
There's no way to track where
a specific case is going to

20:15.157 --> 20:16.623
until after
it's been offloaded.

20:16.625 --> 20:19.159
Yeah. And it doesn't
explain the rave victims.

20:19.161 --> 20:20.944
It would if we're
dealing with two unsubs.

20:20.946 --> 20:24.414
One who alters the drug,
another who doses the wine.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.967
But if someone at the club
is spiking the wine,

20:26.969 --> 20:28.802
how is it ending up
in the hands

20:28.804 --> 20:32.121
of two Manhattan parents
and one underage boy in Harlem?

20:32.123 --> 20:34.170
Garcia, did any of the wine
victims make transactions

20:34.195 --> 20:35.448
at the Edinburgh?

20:35.811 --> 20:37.978
Nothing that's obvious.
I'll keep checking.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.462
Beep beep.

20:39.464 --> 20:40.931
Ok. So...

20:40.933 --> 20:43.299
We have 5 overdose victims

20:43.301 --> 20:46.603
we can connect directly
to the Edinburgh,

20:46.605 --> 20:49.138
a club that condones
drug use.

20:52.243 --> 20:54.528
The answer is there.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.998
Let me call you back.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.666
Thanks.

20:59.668 --> 21:02.485
I heard about those parents.

21:02.487 --> 21:04.371
I want to help.

21:04.373 --> 21:06.089
What do you know?

21:06.091 --> 21:07.641
We think somebody
at the Edinburgh

21:07.643 --> 21:10.627
is dosing bottles of wine
with tampered Ecstasy.

21:13.014 --> 21:15.131
Why? To murder someone?

21:15.133 --> 21:17.133
Well, if they know the drugs
have been tampered with, yes.

21:17.135 --> 21:20.003
If not, they could be using it
as a date rape drug.

21:20.005 --> 21:22.355
Does that sound like something
Thane would do?

21:22.357 --> 21:25.141
Yeah. I've seen him do it.

21:25.143 --> 21:28.311
But he freaked out when he saw
what happened to Anna.

21:28.313 --> 21:30.196
He definitely didn't know.

21:31.816 --> 21:33.617
Who do you think it could be?

21:33.619 --> 21:35.685
Someone farther up
the supply chain.

21:35.687 --> 21:37.153
Thane might know
who it is.

21:37.155 --> 21:39.022
I could help you find out.

21:39.024 --> 21:40.290
How's that?

21:40.292 --> 21:42.659
I know the guy. I can ask him
where he gets his drugs.

21:42.661 --> 21:44.527
Then that might tip off
the real unsub.

21:44.529 --> 21:46.046
Well, couldn't you put
a wire on me?

21:46.048 --> 21:47.864
I can do it without
making him suspicious.

21:47.866 --> 21:50.250
No, Sean. You have no training.
I'm not gonna do that.

21:50.252 --> 21:53.202
And if Thane knows more
than we think he does, it's too risky.

21:53.204 --> 21:54.871
I'm telling you,
I can do this.

21:54.873 --> 21:56.806
Just give me the chance.

22:00.761 --> 22:03.063
Once you tell Thane
that the police questioned you,

22:03.065 --> 22:04.731
you'll have his attention.

22:04.733 --> 22:06.566
Ask him what you're
supposed to say to them

22:06.568 --> 22:08.485
if they want to talk
to you again.

22:08.487 --> 22:11.771
We need some idea
of how the operation's organized.

22:11.773 --> 22:13.273
He's not gonna
just give that up.

22:13.275 --> 22:16.059
Well, if you create
the right circumstances, he might.

22:17.194 --> 22:18.945
The Edinburgh's had a lot
of attention right now

22:18.947 --> 22:21.197
because of the deaths,
and that's not good for business.

22:21.199 --> 22:24.233
And you need to make the
situation sound as bad as possible.

22:24.235 --> 22:26.086
Yeah,
but won't he panic?

22:26.088 --> 22:27.594
Well, without jeopardizing
your safety, that's exactly

22:27.619 --> 22:29.132
what we want him to do.

22:29.374 --> 22:31.708
Even with the spotlight
of the investigation,

22:31.710 --> 22:33.576
the club still needs
to make money.

22:35.262 --> 22:37.964
And that means continuing
to sell the drugs.

22:37.966 --> 22:41.084
Thane's already on edge.

22:41.086 --> 22:44.437
Somebody's probably pressuring
him to make all this go away.

22:44.439 --> 22:47.090
Which is why he'll be desperate
to know what you've said to the police.

22:48.694 --> 22:50.426
Thane needs somebody
on his side right now,

22:50.428 --> 22:53.063
and the more that you can
assure him you're a team player,

22:53.065 --> 22:54.764
the more he's gonna
confide in you.

22:56.701 --> 22:59.202
How do you feel?

22:59.204 --> 23:01.237
Fine. I'm ready.

23:01.239 --> 23:04.240
All right, good. Let's do it.

23:08.496 --> 23:10.046
You're late, Hotchner.

23:10.048 --> 23:14.283
Sorry. Sorry, I got
held up by the cops.

23:14.285 --> 23:16.219
You what?

23:16.221 --> 23:19.723
They called. They wanted to ask
a few more questions.

23:19.725 --> 23:22.008
Oh, they did, did they?

23:22.010 --> 23:24.344
And what did you
tell them, Sean?

23:24.346 --> 23:27.681
Uh...I told them exactly
how it happened, Jim.

23:27.683 --> 23:31.301
That girl started screaming
about being too hot,

23:31.303 --> 23:33.069
Thane and I got her
some water, got her outside

23:33.071 --> 23:36.356
to cool off,
and she collapsed.

23:38.976 --> 23:40.243
You're a good man, Sean.

23:40.245 --> 23:41.728
You understand,
we just don't want them

23:41.730 --> 23:43.146
shutting the place down.

23:43.148 --> 23:46.366
Club like this one closed a few days,
we're finished for good.

23:47.835 --> 23:49.819
Look, fellas,
I like my job.

23:49.821 --> 23:52.655
I'm not about to do anything
to jeopardize that.

23:52.657 --> 23:54.841
Why did they call you in
and not me?

23:54.843 --> 23:56.342
I guess 'cause
I'm the bartender.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.711
I don't know,
they were...

23:57.713 --> 24:00.847
talking about some
bad wine or something.

24:01.932 --> 24:04.184
I tell you, it's a good
thing I got sober.

24:04.186 --> 24:07.871
I had no idea wine could
do that to a person.

24:09.590 --> 24:12.792
I just wish I had known than
Linda had started drinking again.

24:12.794 --> 24:14.544
Then maybe I...

24:14.546 --> 24:17.397
could have done something to help
before it was too late.

24:18.866 --> 24:20.734
That couldn't have
been easy for him.

24:22.019 --> 24:23.870
They connected that girl
to Linda?

24:25.106 --> 24:29.859
Maybe you should dump
that wine just to be safe.

24:30.961 --> 24:33.713
Yeah. Hey, Sean.
Come with me. Give me a hand.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.971
He know anything?

24:41.973 --> 24:44.808
I'm not sure.

25:00.390 --> 25:01.741
Yeah.

25:01.743 --> 25:03.660
Start with these.

25:03.662 --> 25:05.195
You don't want to dump
the whole case?

25:05.197 --> 25:07.530
Uh, no, just--
just those two.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.117
Something wrong?

25:11.119 --> 25:12.986
Yeah. I, uh,

25:12.988 --> 25:15.905
I could've sworn there was
another case of that stuff.

25:15.907 --> 25:18.708
I don't think so.

25:20.761 --> 25:22.245
No, I'm sure of it.

25:22.247 --> 25:24.264
Um, you didn't notice
anything missing

25:24.266 --> 25:26.015
the last time
you did inventory?

25:26.017 --> 25:27.634
No. Everything's here.

25:29.687 --> 25:32.355
No, I'm sure of it.
There was...

25:32.357 --> 25:36.059
another case
of the Whiteland chard.

25:36.061 --> 25:37.593
I don't know what
to tell you, Thane,

25:37.595 --> 25:39.479
but if it's gone,
it's a good thing, right?

25:39.481 --> 25:40.947
We just have to dump it.

25:40.949 --> 25:42.232
No! No, it's not
a good thing.

25:42.234 --> 25:44.200
I need that wine.

25:44.202 --> 25:45.902
Where is it?

25:45.904 --> 25:46.953
It's not here.

25:46.955 --> 25:48.738
It's not here!

25:50.491 --> 25:52.158
What did you do, Thane?

25:52.160 --> 25:53.776
I spiked the wine, you idiot.

25:53.778 --> 25:56.112
3 of the bottles
were in that other case.

25:56.114 --> 25:57.330
Oh, God.

25:57.332 --> 26:00.750
Oh, God.
Jim is gonna kill me.

26:03.453 --> 26:05.004
Why the hell
would you do that?

26:05.006 --> 26:07.974
For a laugh. I thought it was X.
Girls love that crap.

26:07.976 --> 26:09.475
Yeah, but it wasn't x,
was it?

26:09.477 --> 26:10.626
No, I guess not.

26:10.628 --> 26:12.061
He's going off plan,
Hotch.

26:12.063 --> 26:13.930
Get ready to move in.

26:13.932 --> 26:14.964
What was in the wine,
Thane?

26:14.966 --> 26:15.982
I don't know.

26:15.984 --> 26:16.966
Well, where did you get it?

26:16.968 --> 26:18.151
What does it matter?!

26:18.153 --> 26:19.736
Linda's dead because of you.

26:19.738 --> 26:22.238
You son of a bitch. She was sober
and you drugged her.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.523
Yeah, not as sober
as you think.

26:23.525 --> 26:25.074
Look, I wouldn't
if I was you.

26:25.076 --> 26:26.776
You had that Anna girl's
blood all over you.

26:26.778 --> 26:28.818
You don't let it go,
I'm gonna tell them it was you.

26:46.797 --> 26:48.331
What's that?

26:48.333 --> 26:49.999
You bastard.

26:50.001 --> 26:51.667
Drop it!

26:51.669 --> 26:53.002
FBI. Drop it.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.807
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

27:00.527 --> 27:01.527
You...

27:01.529 --> 27:02.528
Let's go.

27:02.530 --> 27:04.030
Ah--

27:05.849 --> 27:06.732
you all right?

27:06.733 --> 27:08.516
I'll wait for you outside.

27:17.242 --> 27:18.493
Caught her trying
to get out

27:18.495 --> 27:19.994
through a grate
in the office.

27:19.996 --> 27:21.061
Was Peters with her?

27:21.063 --> 27:22.497
Not sure. JJ and Alex

27:22.499 --> 27:25.032
are searching
the perimeter.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.739
Thanks.

28:29.807 --> 28:31.475
The crash didn't kill him.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.028
Someone poured PMMA
down his nose and throat.

28:34.030 --> 28:36.597
The drug aside, this is
a completely different M.O.

28:36.599 --> 28:39.433
He's no longer content
to sit back and watch. Why?

28:39.435 --> 28:41.335
The overkill seems personal.
Whoever did this

28:41.337 --> 28:43.987
had a definite grudge
against Peters.

28:45.323 --> 28:48.659
Garcia's running background
and financial records on Sean.

28:48.661 --> 28:51.095
Hotch, you don't think
you're overreacting?

28:51.097 --> 28:53.597
He left the Edinburgh
for a reason. We need to know why.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.349
You can't actually think
that he did this?

28:55.351 --> 28:57.218
I don't, but I can't
eliminate the possibility

28:57.220 --> 28:58.519
until I know
what he's hiding.

28:58.521 --> 28:59.803
Maybe we should look at this
another way.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.022
We know Thane was responsible
for dosing the wine.

29:02.024 --> 29:04.024
That was his own plan,
not the unsub's.

29:04.026 --> 29:06.843
So how would a sociopath seeking
recognition for his achievements

29:06.845 --> 29:08.845
handle someone
interfering with his work?

29:08.847 --> 29:11.031
He'd put a stop to it.

29:11.033 --> 29:13.234
Any way he could.

29:13.236 --> 29:16.120
That was after the Hatchitt
parents were killed.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.156
As innocent victims,
they were the deviation.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.158
So we were wrong.
The unsub does care who dies.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.460
Instead of targeting Thane,
the unsub went after Peters.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.861
He held him responsible.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.029
He may hold Peters
responsible

29:26.031 --> 29:27.498
for more
than Thane's actions.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.667
I'm gonna have Garcia
dig into his life.

29:29.669 --> 29:32.970
In the meantime, we'll use that
to find out what we can.

29:36.374 --> 29:38.809
Well, Thane...

29:38.811 --> 29:40.711
It looks like
we have a problem.

29:40.713 --> 29:41.878
Yeah? What's that, then?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.213
Well, someone's
pretty upset.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.182
Your club's been dosing
innocent women.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.734
Ok, that was Thane's deal.

29:46.736 --> 29:48.769
He'd been dosing X
for years.

29:48.771 --> 29:50.688
But recently it went wrong.

29:50.690 --> 29:52.106
I had nothing
to do with that.

29:52.108 --> 29:53.924
You knew
it was going on.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.409
That makes you
an accessory.

29:55.411 --> 29:58.367
Look, I think I'd like
my phone call now.

29:58.368 --> 29:59.734
You could do that, sure.

29:59.742 --> 30:01.944
Or, we could play
a little game called

30:01.969 --> 30:03.969
"Let's Make A Deal."

30:04.253 --> 30:06.537
I don't want to make
any deals without my lawyer.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.172
Yeah, this one you do.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.625
See, this is what somebody
did to your boss.

30:11.627 --> 30:15.129
You see, Thane,
whoever it is that's out there,

30:15.131 --> 30:18.549
he managed to get
to Jim Peters

30:18.551 --> 30:20.217
outside
of his apartment.

30:20.219 --> 30:24.021
The person who did that
isn't very happy right now.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.941
And he is waiting,
just waiting

30:26.943 --> 30:29.443
to get his hands
on someone else

30:29.445 --> 30:31.610
connected to your club's
operation.

30:31.635 --> 30:33.196
And you know
what we're gonna do?

30:33.733 --> 30:35.232
We're gonna let you go.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.433
You're what?

30:36.435 --> 30:38.319
What makes you think

30:38.321 --> 30:40.788
that if he was able
to get to the big boss,

30:40.790 --> 30:45.442
he'd have any trouble
getting his hands on you?

30:45.444 --> 30:49.613
So, like I said, we're gonna let you
walk right out of here--

30:49.615 --> 30:52.216
All right. I'll tell you
what you want to know.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.717
Just...

30:53.719 --> 30:56.470
You have to protect me.

31:03.478 --> 31:05.629
Still no word from Sean?

31:07.265 --> 31:08.965
We'll find him, Aaron.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.151
How does a guy who has
everything going for him

31:11.153 --> 31:13.654
make one self-destructive
choice after another?

31:13.656 --> 31:16.573
And then when it seems like
he's gonna get his act together,

31:16.575 --> 31:18.075
it all falls apart again.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.160
Were you two ever close?

31:20.162 --> 31:23.080
He was in first grade when I
was sent off to boarding school.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.699
I was the screw-up
making bad choices.

31:25.701 --> 31:27.711
But at a certain point,
I realized I could either

31:27.712 --> 31:30.089
continue to do that or I
could get my act together.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.374
But this doesn't
seem to occur to Sean.

31:33.376 --> 31:36.703
I know he didn't show up
for Haley's funeral.

31:36.986 --> 31:38.500
Right.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.215
And at that point
I decided

31:41.217 --> 31:44.835
I couldn't make him
a priority anymore. I was done.

31:48.606 --> 31:49.890
Hello, my pretties.

31:49.892 --> 31:52.559
I have seen the wizard
and he granted my wish.

31:52.561 --> 31:55.763
Erik Sullivan and Catherine
Hatchitt both withdrew money

31:55.765 --> 31:58.032
from the same ATM
on the day that they died.

31:58.034 --> 32:00.401
That ATM is located
in a bodega

32:00.403 --> 32:01.852
two blocks from the Edinburgh.

32:01.854 --> 32:04.038
What you want to bet that's
where they bought their wine?

32:04.040 --> 32:05.188
Good work, Garcia.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.907
We'll send Morgan and Reid.
Yep.

32:06.909 --> 32:07.875
What'd you find?

32:07.877 --> 32:09.376
Well, they didn't
know names,

32:09.378 --> 32:11.245
but thanks to Thane
and Liz, we now have a map

32:11.247 --> 32:12.463
of the distribution chain.

32:12.465 --> 32:15.049
The Ecstasy was flown
from Canada into Franklin,

32:15.051 --> 32:16.967
a private airport
outside the city.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.136
And then a courier
transports the drug supply

32:19.138 --> 32:21.872
to 5 drop-off points, where
the dealers pick up the product

32:21.874 --> 32:23.373
and then sell it
to their clients.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.892
And the clients
include local clubs

32:24.894 --> 32:26.310
and underground
party venues.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.095
How many of those clubs
were connected to Peters?

32:28.097 --> 32:31.265
Two. But only the Edinburgh
received the tainted X.

32:31.267 --> 32:33.817
All right, let's find out everything
we can about the other club.

32:39.223 --> 32:41.692
How do you expect
to stay in business

32:41.694 --> 32:43.660
if you open 20 minutes
late every day?

32:43.662 --> 32:46.914
I got a hangover.
What is it to you?

32:46.916 --> 32:48.832
We'd like to talk to you
about your inventory.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.367
We pulled your shipping
orders, Mr. Beaird.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.736
It appears you're selling
more product than you're taking in.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.422
Don't you guys have
anything better to do

32:55.424 --> 32:56.840
than to harass
an old shopkeeper?

32:56.842 --> 33:00.210
Yes, actually we do,
so can we not waste any time?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.762
Where do you get
your extra goods?

33:01.764 --> 33:03.714
Private donations.

33:03.716 --> 33:06.550
Do those donors include
employees of local establishments?

33:06.552 --> 33:10.220
Look, sometimes a guy
nicks a bottle

33:10.222 --> 33:11.922
or the supplies from
his place of employment

33:11.924 --> 33:13.440
and brings it to me.

33:13.442 --> 33:15.275
If I can sell it,
I take it off his hands

33:15.277 --> 33:16.777
at a bargain price.

33:16.779 --> 33:18.762
Does that include
cases of wine?

33:18.764 --> 33:21.148
Yeah. I bought one
a couple of weeks ago.

33:21.150 --> 33:23.767
Funny thing. The guy
came back yesterday

33:23.769 --> 33:27.237
and paid the full price
for what was left.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.105
Strange fellow.

33:31.409 --> 33:32.993
Guys, I found
something stranger

33:32.995 --> 33:34.311
than a time-traveling
police box.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.412
What's that?

33:35.414 --> 33:36.713
I ran financial records

33:36.715 --> 33:38.916
for all the people who work
at the Franklin airport.

33:38.918 --> 33:41.385
There is a baggage handler
named Mike Spires

33:41.387 --> 33:44.054
who's been making
ridiculously large cash deposits

33:44.056 --> 33:45.722
to his checking account
on a weekly basis.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.593
Here's what's weird--

33:46.618 --> 33:48.618
he's been dead
for the last 4 weeks.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.528
So how's he still
making deposits?

33:51.530 --> 33:52.796
Right?

33:54.767 --> 33:56.183
Hotchner.
Aaron.

33:56.185 --> 33:57.601
Sean, you need
to come in.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.570
We think you may be
in danger from the unsub.

33:59.572 --> 34:01.738
He's targeting
Edinburgh employees.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.440
Yeah, I heard
about Jim Peters.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.608
Look, I didn't
kill him.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.944
I know that.
I also know why you ran.

34:06.946 --> 34:08.745
Of course you do.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.782
Just come in so that
we can protect you.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.250
It's time to stop running.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.319
Solve the case
and I'll stop.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.710
If Spires has been dead
for a month,

34:32.712 --> 34:33.893
he can't be our guy.

34:33.896 --> 34:35.263
Why would the dealers
keep paying him?

34:35.264 --> 34:36.681
They don't know
that their courier died.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.047
Someone must have
taken his place.

34:38.050 --> 34:39.717
The unsub.
He killed Spires

34:39.719 --> 34:41.552
so he could get his hands
on the drug supply.

34:41.554 --> 34:44.221
Who else knew he was a courier?
Another package handler?

34:44.223 --> 34:45.572
Sure. They must be
on the take, too,

34:45.574 --> 34:47.024
paid to look
the other way.

34:47.025 --> 34:49.193
Garcia, do any
of the baggage handlers

34:49.195 --> 34:50.645
show a history
of drug abuse?

34:50.647 --> 34:53.614
A few minor infractions,
but nothing that sticks out.

34:53.616 --> 34:55.565
All right, widen the search.
Have any airport employees

34:55.568 --> 34:57.702
had a drug death
in the family recently?

34:57.704 --> 35:00.021
Uh...

35:00.023 --> 35:01.122
Yeah.

35:01.124 --> 35:04.258
The daughter
of Larry Feretich,

35:04.260 --> 35:06.544
Megan, she died
two months ago

35:06.546 --> 35:08.879
of a suspected
Ecstasy overdose.

35:08.881 --> 35:09.930
There's your trigger.

35:09.932 --> 35:10.931
Where did she die?

35:10.933 --> 35:12.416
Uh...The Obsidian.

35:12.418 --> 35:14.552
It's the other club
owned by Jim Peters.

35:14.554 --> 35:17.588
He's smart. He avoided
dosing the Obsidian supply

35:17.590 --> 35:20.191
so we couldn't connect
the murders to him.

35:20.193 --> 35:21.726
Garcia,
where's Feretich now?

35:23.712 --> 35:25.429
At the airport.

35:25.431 --> 35:26.947
All right,
notify Morgan and Reid.

35:26.949 --> 35:28.566
Yeah.

35:38.443 --> 35:39.710
Larry Feretich?

35:40.912 --> 35:42.946
FBI.

35:52.057 --> 35:54.392
Larry Feretich, you're under arrest
for the murder of--

35:54.394 --> 35:56.844
He killed my daughter!
He killed Megan!

35:56.846 --> 35:59.129
No, he didn't.
A drug killed your daughter.

35:59.131 --> 36:00.681
No, it was Jim Peters.

36:00.683 --> 36:03.967
I said so,
but no one would listen.

36:03.969 --> 36:05.803
Thank you.

36:05.805 --> 36:07.738
That was the Canadian
drug agency.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.907
They closed down operations
at their airport.

36:09.909 --> 36:11.409
That's a relief.

36:11.411 --> 36:13.811
Now Sean can
come out of hiding.

36:13.813 --> 36:16.013
He's exonerated.

36:16.015 --> 36:17.915
That's something.

36:23.873 --> 36:25.423
Well, I don't know
about you all, but I'm exhausted.

36:25.425 --> 36:29.677
I'm gonna head back
to the hotel and take a bath.

36:29.679 --> 36:31.512
I could drive you.

36:31.514 --> 36:33.163
I'm heading that way.

36:33.165 --> 36:35.383
Thank you, Alex.

36:35.385 --> 36:37.835
So I'll see everyone
on the jet tomorrow.

36:44.509 --> 36:46.527
Could you be
any more obvious?

36:47.396 --> 36:48.863
I think I preferred you

36:48.865 --> 36:50.865
before you were a profiler.

36:50.867 --> 36:54.151
Really?

36:59.625 --> 37:02.543
Here, buddy.

37:02.545 --> 37:04.545
Give me that.

37:07.582 --> 37:08.749
Hey.

37:08.751 --> 37:09.750
Hey.

37:09.752 --> 37:11.034
Come on in.

37:13.972 --> 37:16.540
Jack, do you remember
Uncle Sean?

37:16.542 --> 37:18.175
Hey, Jack.

37:18.177 --> 37:20.227
It's been a long time.

37:20.229 --> 37:21.879
Hi.

37:21.881 --> 37:23.180
And this is Beth.

37:23.182 --> 37:25.215
It's great
to finally meet you.

37:25.217 --> 37:27.568
Yeah, well, it's not like we live
in the same city or anything.

37:30.238 --> 37:33.574
Jack, how about we go look at
all that cool stuff

37:33.576 --> 37:34.942
you got at the
museum today, huh?

37:34.944 --> 37:37.194
Mm-hmm.
Ok.

37:38.897 --> 37:40.498
Say goodbye
to Uncle Sean, Jack.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.732
Bye.

37:41.734 --> 37:44.168
Bye. I'll see you soon, huh?

37:50.175 --> 37:53.594
So how did you know
I took the wine?

37:53.596 --> 37:56.046
I know what you sound like
when you tell a lie.

37:56.048 --> 37:58.766
You said something
to Thane about the wine,

37:58.768 --> 38:02.052
and I could hear you
calming yourself down.

38:02.054 --> 38:04.388
My brother the profiler.

38:04.390 --> 38:05.806
It has more to do
with being your brother

38:05.831 --> 38:07.156
than being a profiler.

38:08.110 --> 38:10.444
What did you get
for the wine?

38:12.263 --> 38:13.898
100 bucks.

38:14.983 --> 38:17.601
I needed it for rent.

38:17.603 --> 38:19.904
Sean, you and I
need to do better.

38:19.906 --> 38:23.440
Yeah, I want to, Aaron.

38:23.442 --> 38:26.460
Look, I know
what I have to do.

38:26.462 --> 38:28.278
Know any good lawyers?

38:28.280 --> 38:30.247
I've made a couple calls.

38:31.666 --> 38:34.117
There are two officers
waiting downstairs.

38:34.119 --> 38:35.904
Yeah, I know.
I saw them on my way up.

38:36.766 --> 38:38.766
I'll walk you down.

39:07.536 --> 39:10.254
"Cruel
is the strife of brothers."

39:10.256 --> 39:11.622
Aristotle.

39:26.138 --> 39:27.771
That's not right.
Why is that happening?

39:29.357 --> 39:30.891
What...

39:34.813 --> 39:36.680
What--what--

39:37.866 --> 39:39.083
wait--

39:40.201 --> 39:42.286
that's what the...
That's what the Replicator--

39:42.288 --> 39:43.904
that's what
the Replicator said.

39:43.906 --> 39:45.489
Where is he?

39:45.491 --> 39:48.208
How did he get in my--

39:48.210 --> 39:50.661
how did he do it?
How did he get in?

39:50.663 --> 39:53.314
how did he get in?
Hey!

40:14.259 --> 40:19.259
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

41:18.923 --> 41:20.274
Ooh.

41:31.942 --> 41:34.242
Wait!

41:34.244 --> 41:35.377
Kids!

41:35.379 --> 41:37.212
Wait for me!

41:49.893 --> 41:53.461
Do you really think your team
is going to save you?

41:53.463 --> 41:55.513
I know they will.

41:55.515 --> 41:57.432
Did you get everything
you wanted?

41:57.434 --> 41:58.433
What?

41:58.435 --> 41:59.467
In life.

41:59.469 --> 42:01.302
Did you?

42:01.304 --> 42:03.471
Does anyone?

42:03.473 --> 42:05.573
We should. Heh.

42:05.575 --> 42:08.159
That's the point.

42:08.161 --> 42:10.811
Drinking
got in your way.

42:10.813 --> 42:12.530
Your husband
couldn't help.

42:12.532 --> 42:16.367
Though God knows he tried.

42:16.369 --> 42:18.819
You know my husband?

42:18.821 --> 42:20.505
And your poor children

42:20.507 --> 42:23.824
always played second fiddle
to your ambition.

42:23.826 --> 42:26.127
I can't see.

42:28.263 --> 42:30.598
Oh, thank God. David.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.433
He was here.
You have to find him.

42:32.435 --> 42:34.352
I will. I promise.

42:34.354 --> 42:36.804
Thank you.

42:36.806 --> 42:41.075
All the love in the world
won't save you.

42:41.077 --> 42:42.643
What?

42:42.645 --> 42:45.880
We're not finished yet.

42:46.899 --> 42:48.566
Ohh...

42:52.038 --> 42:54.489
Ohh...

42:59.328 --> 43:01.879
The Replicator's here
in New York.

43:01.881 --> 43:05.833
He took pictures of us and
he hacked into Garcia's system.

43:05.835 --> 43:07.502
I know. I will.

43:07.504 --> 43:09.303
I love you, too.

43:09.305 --> 43:10.505
Bye.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.840
Hey, Garcia.

43:12.842 --> 43:14.509
Are you guys ok?

43:14.511 --> 43:15.893
Yeah, yeah.
I got Derek with me.

43:15.895 --> 43:17.211
We're meeting everyone
at the hotel.

43:17.213 --> 43:19.013
I don't know
how he got in.

43:19.015 --> 43:20.932
I'm gonna shut down the system
before the Replicator can.

43:20.934 --> 43:23.384
I am so sorry.
I check everything.

43:23.386 --> 43:25.353
I upgrade constantly.

43:25.355 --> 43:27.054
It's not your fault,
Penelope.

43:27.056 --> 43:28.389
He's just that good.

43:28.391 --> 43:30.441
And he wanted us to know
that he's here hunting us.

43:30.443 --> 43:32.243
Hold on. You got
an external override.

43:32.245 --> 43:35.279
And if the only way to get in is with
the pre-authorized hard line

43:35.281 --> 43:37.081
and he didn't get in
via Quantico...

43:37.083 --> 43:38.282
Oh, my God.

43:38.284 --> 43:39.500
What?

43:39.502 --> 43:41.819
He was in my house.

43:49.462 --> 43:50.363
Strauss isn't answering.

43:50.364 --> 43:51.997
Keep trying. Reid,
any luck with Blake?

43:51.999 --> 43:53.782
Not yet.

43:53.784 --> 43:55.784
The pictures of you were taken
outside of Beth's apartment.

43:55.786 --> 43:57.986
I get it if you want to stay
with them until we find him.

43:57.988 --> 43:59.487
I've got agents
surrounding Beth's building.

43:59.489 --> 44:01.488
She and Jack are safer without me,
since we're the targets.

44:01.489 --> 44:02.762
Blake, we'll pick you up
in a few minutes.

44:02.787 --> 44:04.152
The Replicator's back.

44:04.576 --> 44:07.810
You've reached Erin Strauss.
Please leave me a detailed message.

44:07.812 --> 44:12.198
Hey, it's me again. I got your text,
but I guess you fell asleep.

44:40.861 --> 44:44.030
Hotch. Something's wrong.

44:51.121 --> 44:53.406
The window's open.
She'd never sleep like that.

44:53.408 --> 44:55.458
Did something happen
to make her drink again?

44:55.460 --> 44:58.661
No! She was working
real hard at--

45:03.133 --> 45:04.834
this represents a year sober.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.036
She hasn't let to of it
since she got it.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.138
She's even a sponsor now.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.757
The Replicator has her.
I'll check the roof.

45:11.759 --> 45:13.208
I'll have Morgan
meet you up there.

45:14.144 --> 45:16.395
Strauss is missing.
Blake, you and Reid

45:16.397 --> 45:17.440
talk to hotel security.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.149
We need access points and
footage from every camera.

45:19.150 --> 45:21.067
Morgan, back up Dave
on the roof. JJ,

45:21.069 --> 45:23.052
take the west staircase,
I'll take the east.

45:25.857 --> 45:26.822
Erin.

45:26.824 --> 45:29.942
Not quite.
Does it ever get confusing,

45:29.944 --> 45:31.994
that whole
Erin/Aaron thing?

45:31.996 --> 45:32.995
Where is she?

45:32.997 --> 45:34.530
Closer than you think.

45:34.532 --> 45:36.115
But she's not doing well.

45:36.117 --> 45:37.833
She looks a bit pale.

45:39.586 --> 45:42.538
Remember the last time
you got a call like this?

45:45.076 --> 45:46.208
Remember?

45:46.210 --> 45:47.576
George Foyet, right?

45:47.578 --> 45:50.046
You were too late.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.039
Rossi.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.491
What the hell happened?

46:18.493 --> 46:20.409
Her room was a wreck.

46:20.411 --> 46:22.545
She been drinking?

46:22.547 --> 46:25.280
No.

46:28.451 --> 46:30.503
Rossi, you sure?

46:30.505 --> 46:32.722
Look, if the Replicator took her,
he's probably long gone.

46:32.724 --> 46:35.141
But he left the window open
so we would come up here.

46:35.143 --> 46:36.641
Well, then this is
some kind of trap

46:36.666 --> 46:38.177
or he wants us
to see something.

46:41.598 --> 46:43.432
There she is!

46:46.154 --> 46:47.687
Dave! Dave, I've got her!

46:47.689 --> 46:51.190
She's on a bench, she's a block
east of the hotel. Call EMTs.

46:51.192 --> 46:52.825
Erin.

46:54.027 --> 46:55.978
Is he armed?

46:57.164 --> 46:59.331
Is he armed?

47:01.368 --> 47:02.585
Erin.

47:02.587 --> 47:04.870
I tried to find you.

47:04.872 --> 47:06.088
It's ok.
Help is on the way.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.540
Go--

47:07.542 --> 47:09.925
Erin, you've been drugged.
We need to get you to a hospital.

47:09.927 --> 47:12.878
No, I can't.
It's happening so fast.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.130
Dave's called
the paramedics.

47:14.132 --> 47:16.348
He said he's gonna
race you home.

47:16.350 --> 47:18.167
Does that mean
anything to you?

47:18.169 --> 47:21.437
You have to find him.

47:21.439 --> 47:24.523
It's so quiet.
Why is it so quiet?

47:24.525 --> 47:26.025
Erin, did you
recognize him?

47:26.027 --> 47:28.728
He put a gun
to my head.

47:28.730 --> 47:30.730
He made me drink.

47:30.732 --> 47:31.731
I'm sorry.

47:31.733 --> 47:33.199
I wish I'd let him
kill me.

47:33.201 --> 47:35.201
Did you know him?

47:35.203 --> 47:37.453
No.

47:37.455 --> 47:39.371
He knows my family.

47:39.373 --> 47:41.457
He knows my children!

47:41.459 --> 47:44.543
You have to protect my kids!
You have to find him!

47:44.545 --> 47:47.463
We will. We will.
Just take a breath.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.802
I love my children.

47:52.804 --> 47:54.470
Please tell them.

47:54.472 --> 47:56.338
They know. They know.

47:57.707 --> 48:01.310
Once you said I loved
my son the most.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.762
That's not true.

48:02.764 --> 48:04.096
I'm sorry.

48:04.098 --> 48:05.881
I was wrong.

48:07.984 --> 48:10.770
Aaron, I can't see you.

48:10.772 --> 48:13.572
I'm right here.

48:13.574 --> 48:16.192
I don't want to die alone.

48:16.194 --> 48:19.829
I'm right here.
It's ok.

48:22.749 --> 48:25.534
Shh, shh...

48:25.536 --> 48:27.419
It's ok.

not to make us sorry, but wise."

49:07.047 --> 49:08.963
H.G. Wells.

49:08.965 --> 49:10.715
We've got an APB,
but the description

49:10.717 --> 49:12.267
of the Replicator
is too general.

49:12.269 --> 49:14.235
He wiped out all of the
hotel security cameras.

49:14.237 --> 49:16.054
ATM and traffic cameras
were compromised also.

49:16.056 --> 49:18.139
Which means he hacked into
at least two dozen systems.

49:18.141 --> 49:19.574
Well, he got into
Garcia's place,

49:19.576 --> 49:21.743
which mean he can get in anywhere.
This guy's bragging.

49:21.745 --> 49:23.444
He also wants us to know
he can take massive risks

49:23.446 --> 49:24.896
and still get away with it.

49:24.898 --> 49:27.448
It's probably why he took Strauss
into a crowd of people.

49:27.450 --> 49:29.267
That and to humiliate
her publicly.

49:29.269 --> 49:31.686
But he called Hotch
from her phone.

49:31.688 --> 49:34.021
It was important to him
that we find her alive.

49:34.023 --> 49:36.541
The Director wants this
contained and solved.

49:36.543 --> 49:38.326
Well, at least
he's not taking us off the case.

49:38.328 --> 49:40.745
He's given us 24 hours
and then he will.

49:43.916 --> 49:46.668
I'm taking her back
to Bethesda.

49:46.670 --> 49:48.803
She never liked this city,
Aaron.

49:48.805 --> 49:51.089
I'm not about to leave her.

50:05.904 --> 50:08.072
Could you give us
a minute, please.

50:10.659 --> 50:13.328
Is Jack staying here?

50:13.330 --> 50:15.563
I think it's a good idea.

50:17.366 --> 50:19.917
You're lucky to have Beth.

50:19.919 --> 50:23.454
I know.

50:23.456 --> 50:26.924
Her children want
to meet me at Bethesda.

50:26.926 --> 50:29.910
How old are they now?

50:29.912 --> 50:32.714
Too young for this.

50:32.716 --> 50:35.466
You all right?

50:37.136 --> 50:39.187
She smells of booze,
Aaron.

50:39.189 --> 50:43.141
You and I know it's because
that bastard took away her dignity.

50:43.143 --> 50:46.477
But her children
might not believe that.

50:46.479 --> 50:48.396
It's hard for them to trust

50:48.398 --> 50:50.765
anything to do with
her drinking.

50:53.369 --> 50:56.988
She struggled with it
all her life.

50:56.990 --> 51:00.124
And she was finally
beating it.

51:11.003 --> 51:12.337
He knew about Foyet?

51:12.339 --> 51:13.388
Who's that?

51:13.390 --> 51:14.789
He's the man
who killed my wife.

51:14.791 --> 51:16.591
That's a classified
case that's not in any database.

51:16.593 --> 51:18.092
Then how would he
know about it?

51:18.094 --> 51:19.477
If he had access
to the file,

51:19.479 --> 51:20.978
we're talking about
someone on the inside.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.647
Conference room in 5.

52:24.410 --> 52:26.127
Garcia,
is this everything?

52:26.129 --> 52:27.628
Yeah. The Replicator stuff
is here,

52:27.630 --> 52:29.196
and the team stuff
is there and there.

52:29.198 --> 52:30.214
How's Rossi?

52:30.216 --> 52:31.215
Not good.

52:31.217 --> 52:32.884
Is he with Strauss?
Yeah.

52:32.886 --> 52:35.470
Ok. Uh--uh, I started with
the question you asked--

52:35.472 --> 52:38.005
why attack Strauss,
and on this day?

52:38.007 --> 52:40.725
The most obvious answer is
that it's an anniversary of some sort.

52:40.727 --> 52:42.710
But there's nothing
historically relevant.

52:42.712 --> 52:44.145
It could be
the smallest thing.

52:44.147 --> 52:45.897
Concentrate on New York.
If the date's that important,

52:45.899 --> 52:47.014
the setting could be, too.

52:47.016 --> 52:48.516
It would be easier to
attack Strauss at home.

52:48.518 --> 52:50.818
Is there a reason why he waited
for her to be out?

52:50.820 --> 52:52.720
Well, considering she's
hardly ever in the field,

52:52.722 --> 52:54.188
he sure got a lot
of photos of Strauss.

52:54.190 --> 52:55.723
It's like
he's obsessed with her.

52:55.725 --> 52:58.242
Maybe Strauss was
always his first target.

52:58.244 --> 53:00.394
He attacked the top
of the BAU chain first.

53:00.396 --> 53:01.746
All right, Reid,
you've matched up

53:01.748 --> 53:03.247
all the murder locations
with the dates.

53:03.249 --> 53:04.732
Now we need to know
how long it would take

53:04.734 --> 53:06.233
to drive
to each of these locations,

53:06.235 --> 53:07.585
assuming a home base
in the district.

53:07.587 --> 53:09.120
He brought the fight here
for a reason.

53:09.122 --> 53:10.538
Well, it's nearly
impossible to figure out

53:10.540 --> 53:13.124
when he arrived and departed
New York, but we should try.

53:13.126 --> 53:14.909
I'll collect all the public and
private transport stuff.

53:14.911 --> 53:16.410
Garcia, I need Kevin
to go through

53:16.412 --> 53:18.262
every single pixel
of these photographs.

53:18.264 --> 53:20.848
This unsub gets off
on taunting us.

53:20.850 --> 53:23.968
He's given us answers here.
We just haven't found them yet.

53:32.895 --> 53:34.445
Are you all right?

53:34.447 --> 53:37.064
Yeah.

53:37.066 --> 53:38.950
She was a good woman.

53:38.952 --> 53:41.118
I know. I'm sorry.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.287
Are those her children
out there?

53:43.289 --> 53:46.874
Her ex is on the way.

53:46.876 --> 53:48.876
You know the family well.

53:48.878 --> 53:51.913
It feels like I do.

53:51.915 --> 53:54.281
Through her.

53:54.283 --> 53:58.553
So, uh, when will we
get the tox results?

53:58.555 --> 53:59.887
We have them.

53:59.889 --> 54:01.789
It's what you expected.
Meth and Ecstasy combo.

54:01.791 --> 54:03.517
Though it didn't cause
the internal boiling like

54:03.542 --> 54:04.726
with the New York victims.

54:04.727 --> 54:06.594
A lower dose,
or did he alter it?

54:06.596 --> 54:08.563
We won't know until
we get the exact breakdown.

54:08.565 --> 54:11.098
I'll let you know
the second I hear.

54:11.100 --> 54:13.100
So what do you make
of the markings on her wrist?

54:13.102 --> 54:16.771
Torture, right?
It was done antemortem.

54:16.773 --> 54:17.855
What?

54:17.857 --> 54:19.640
The carving I showed you.

54:19.642 --> 54:21.776
Right.

54:21.778 --> 54:24.829
Sorry. Can you
show me that again?

54:32.838 --> 54:34.255
Dave, a figure 8?

54:34.257 --> 54:35.456
That's what it looks like.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.924
I just sent you all
a picture.

54:36.926 --> 54:38.659
Maybe it's an infinity symbol.

54:38.661 --> 54:41.312
Well, if it's infinity,
he could be boasting

54:41.337 --> 54:42.514
"I'll go on forever"?

54:42.515 --> 54:45.666
Or if it's an 8, Strauss was
his eighth victim.

54:45.668 --> 54:48.102
And the unofficial
eighth member of our team.

54:48.104 --> 54:49.887
If this is a taunt from him,
it's too random.

54:49.889 --> 54:51.189
Well, he's only sent
one message

54:51.214 --> 54:52.357
and he seems
to be real proud of it.

54:52.358 --> 54:53.357
Zugzwang.

54:53.359 --> 54:54.976
Then what
does this mean?

54:54.978 --> 54:56.527
Rossi, the cut looks jagged.

54:56.529 --> 54:58.779
Any idea what caused
the serration?

54:58.781 --> 55:00.781
Best guess
is a piece of glass.

55:00.783 --> 55:02.850
Maybe he used empty bottles
from the mini bar?

55:02.852 --> 55:04.368
Those were all plastic.

55:04.370 --> 55:06.520
The M.E. is checking
for splinters now.

55:06.522 --> 55:07.855
All right, let us know
what you find out.

55:07.857 --> 55:09.707
Anything from
the photographs yet?

55:09.709 --> 55:12.710
We blew up a few more
and this one seems to stand out.

55:12.712 --> 55:14.194
When were you in a tuxedo?

55:14.196 --> 55:15.580
It was a British embassy
event.

55:15.582 --> 55:17.081
Security clearance
is high.

55:17.083 --> 55:18.833
Security was insane there.

55:18.835 --> 55:21.252
That kind of accessibility, plus
knowing about Foyet,

55:21.254 --> 55:23.039
the fact that he was able
to get through all of my

55:23.064 --> 55:24.590
security clearances alone,

55:24.591 --> 55:26.057
you guys are right.
You have to trust your gut.

55:26.059 --> 55:28.476
The Replicator has
gotta be on the inside.

55:28.478 --> 55:30.511
The Director needs to know
the status of the system failure.

55:30.513 --> 55:32.013
Give me another
few hours.

55:32.015 --> 55:34.231
He's not happy about it.
Yeah, well, who is?

56:46.886 --> 56:49.081
If the Replicator's
an insider,

56:49.082 --> 56:50.782
is there any way
Strauss knew him?

56:50.784 --> 56:52.717
She said she didn't
recognize him.

56:52.719 --> 56:55.086
To her defense, she was disoriented
by the drug overdose.

56:55.088 --> 56:56.304
She was adamant about it.

56:56.306 --> 56:57.622
Well, even if Strauss
didn't know him,

56:57.624 --> 56:59.007
it doesn't mean
he didn't know her.

56:59.009 --> 57:01.176
Within the Bureau,
she is the face of the BAU.

57:01.178 --> 57:03.812
And clearly a target
from the beginning. But why?

57:03.814 --> 57:06.231
More importantly,
what was he replicating?

57:06.233 --> 57:07.649
The drug overdose.

57:07.651 --> 57:09.684
I mean with the 8. It hasn't
been part of any other case,

57:09.686 --> 57:11.319
and he's not one
to make mistakes.

57:11.321 --> 57:12.687
He thought he was
replicating a crime.

57:12.689 --> 57:15.023
The Director made us walk away
from the case a few months ago.

57:15.025 --> 57:16.274
Strauss said that
she wouldn't let it go.

57:16.276 --> 57:18.193
What if she hadn't?

57:18.195 --> 57:20.478
You think she started
her own investigation?

57:20.480 --> 57:21.746
Well, if she thought
he was an insider,

57:21.748 --> 57:23.415
she might have done
something to trap him.

57:23.417 --> 57:25.250
Why wouldn't she have
told you about that back in New York?

57:25.252 --> 57:26.751
Maybe she didn't have proof.

57:26.753 --> 57:30.005
But her determination, plus the fact
that he doesn't make mistakes

57:30.007 --> 57:33.008
makes me think that the 8
was part of her plan to catch him.

57:36.963 --> 57:38.380
Do we have her laptop?

57:39.882 --> 57:42.350
All the hacking in the world
isn't gonna help

57:42.352 --> 57:44.019
if they shut us down.

57:44.021 --> 57:45.804
He can't win,
not like this.

57:45.806 --> 57:47.639
This is Strauss' laptop.

57:47.641 --> 57:49.856
I need to access who was
on the distribution list

57:49.881 --> 57:50.893
for my case reports.

57:50.894 --> 57:52.561
You don't know
who reads your reports?

57:52.563 --> 57:54.195
I know she sent them
to the head of the criminal division

57:54.197 --> 57:56.114
and the Director, but I don't
know who else is on the list.

57:56.116 --> 57:57.849
The last case
she sent in

57:57.851 --> 57:59.234
was the case
in Detroit.

57:59.236 --> 58:01.236
The Cutter.

58:04.040 --> 58:06.374
She amended the report
and said that the unsub

58:06.376 --> 58:08.192
cut a figure 8
into his victims' wrists.

58:08.194 --> 58:09.210
But he didn't do that.

58:09.212 --> 58:10.495
No, he didn't.

58:10.497 --> 58:12.047
So she duped him. Which means
that one of the people

58:12.049 --> 58:14.215
reading these reports
has gotta be the Replicator.

58:14.217 --> 58:15.700
It doesn't show
who else saw this.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.387
Two other people
read the report.

58:19.389 --> 58:20.555
Who?

58:20.557 --> 58:22.891
You're gonna
need a tie.

58:22.893 --> 58:25.594
Agent Hotchner,
I have a very full day.

58:25.596 --> 58:27.979
Yes, sir, we all do.
Senator, can I suggest

58:27.981 --> 58:29.748
that we move this
into your office.

58:29.750 --> 58:32.417
There's nothing you can tell me
that these walls have not heard before.

58:32.419 --> 58:34.719
How long has the Department of Justice
been watching the BAU?

58:34.721 --> 58:36.388
That's no secret.
We made it clear to your Director

58:36.390 --> 58:39.057
and your section chief that we
were watching your team closely

58:39.059 --> 58:40.558
ever since that ordeal
with agent...

58:40.560 --> 58:41.910
Prentiss.
Yes.

58:41.912 --> 58:43.078
She's running an office
in London

58:43.080 --> 58:44.395
and that's a good place
for her.

58:44.397 --> 58:46.414
You receive my case files
from the Director.

58:46.416 --> 58:47.916
Well, agent,
that's classified.

58:47.918 --> 58:49.334
Sir, it's not a question.
I know you're on the list.

58:49.336 --> 58:50.902
I need to know who else
has access to them.

58:50.904 --> 58:52.587
I'm not answering that
until I get some insight

58:52.589 --> 58:54.005
as to what
this is all about.

58:54.007 --> 58:55.373
There's a man
that's been replicating

58:55.375 --> 58:56.875
many of the crimes that
we've solved in the last year.

58:56.877 --> 58:58.543
Erin Strauss told us
all about it.

58:58.545 --> 59:02.047
He killed last night, sir, in New York.
She was murdered.

59:02.049 --> 59:03.548
Wh?

59:03.550 --> 59:05.133
Why haven't I been told
about this?

59:05.135 --> 59:06.718
The Director's
keeping this contained.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.054
We believe that this unsub
is targeting the rest of us,

59:09.056 --> 59:10.221
and we've determined
that he's someone

59:10.223 --> 59:11.856
within the highest levels
of the justice system

59:11.858 --> 59:13.808
and he's been reading
the details of my reports.

59:13.810 --> 59:15.143
I need the names, sir.

59:16.646 --> 59:19.280
At least
this narrows it down.

59:19.282 --> 59:21.533
Finding someone on the inside
should be easier.

59:21.535 --> 59:24.285
Not necessarily. If our unsub
was trained by law enforcement,

59:24.287 --> 59:26.204
he'd know how to fit in
perfectly.

59:26.206 --> 59:27.739
There's meaning and purpose
to everything he does.

59:27.741 --> 59:29.774
Why did he choose
to replicate the Silencer case?

59:29.776 --> 59:32.711
Well, that unsub went dormant
for years 'cause he was locked up.

59:32.713 --> 59:34.329
Is that a clue
about the Replicator?

59:34.331 --> 59:36.715
Well, it speaks
to his patience.

59:36.717 --> 59:39.084
What about his M.O.?
He sewed mouths shut.

59:39.086 --> 59:41.052
It symbolizes
keeping secrets.

59:41.054 --> 59:43.054
There could be
something in that.

59:43.056 --> 59:44.389
He's targeting everyone.

59:44.391 --> 59:47.342
So how does that particular
case factor into all of us?

59:47.344 --> 59:49.644
It's the first one Garcia
and I worked on with Blake.

59:49.646 --> 59:53.348
Yeah, but the rest of us worked
on the Seattle case before that.

59:53.350 --> 59:56.935
Right. The unsub who used
his kid to bait the victims.

59:56.937 --> 01:00:00.155
We need to see
if he replicated that one.

01:00:00.157 --> 01:00:02.306
The system is still down,
thanks to yours truly,

01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.491
which I'm horrified about.

01:00:03.493 --> 01:00:05.110
I'm trying to get the deets
on the Seattle case

01:00:05.112 --> 01:00:06.945
this way now, literally.

01:00:06.947 --> 01:00:09.814
You and I were in London when
the other guys spent time in Seattle.

01:00:09.816 --> 01:00:11.683
I'm on the phone right now
with Jennie from ViCAP

01:00:11.685 --> 01:00:13.752
to see if that particular M.O.
has ever been duplicated.

01:00:13.754 --> 01:00:14.819
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:00:14.821 --> 01:00:18.123
Uh, it would be Seattle,
early September.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.257
Right.

01:00:19.259 --> 01:00:22.427
No, not email.
Can you fax it?

01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:23.628
Fax, yeah.

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.013
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:00:25.015 --> 01:00:26.548
I take that as a yes.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.183
Before he copied
the Silencer case,

01:00:28.185 --> 01:00:29.934
he was in Seattle weeks after they
solved the sadist.

01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:32.387
Go check the fax machine.
She just sent you that replicated case.

01:00:32.389 --> 01:00:33.805
Thanks, baby girl.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:33.807 --> 01:00:36.007
Ok. I did something right.
I did something right.

01:01:38.287 --> 01:01:40.955
I need everybody
in the conference room.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:46.140
A dozen federal employees

01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.263
have read our case files
over the last two years.

01:01:47.264 --> 01:01:48.847
They all went through
the highest levels of security.

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:51.633
Each of those names needs
to be checked against Reid's list.

01:01:51.635 --> 01:01:53.802
We should get them all in here
and start the interrogations.

01:01:53.804 --> 01:01:55.804
If he knows we're looking his way,
he might retreat.

01:01:55.806 --> 01:01:57.435
We should also check
the support staffs

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.423
of all those employees.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:01.442
Each one has two assistants,
so we're already up to 36 people.

01:02:01.444 --> 01:02:03.728
We should start with agents
who work a 4-day, 40-hour week,

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.455
given the fact that most of the
murders happened

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.966
over a long weekend,
which means if the unsub

01:02:06.099 --> 01:02:08.783
traveled by car, no one
at work would've missed them.

01:02:08.785 --> 01:02:10.101
Well, he probably
wouldn't fly.

01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:11.602
It would leave
a paper trail.

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:12.871
What's this?

01:02:12.873 --> 01:02:14.405
The Replicator's first case
was the same as mine.

01:02:14.407 --> 01:02:17.041
Remember the sadist
who made Ridgeway look tame?

01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:19.043
In Seattle, so it wasn't
the Silencer.

01:02:19.045 --> 01:02:20.611
Do you think
it's a coincidence

01:02:20.613 --> 01:02:22.964
he started all of this
when I joined the team?

01:02:22.966 --> 01:02:25.633
I don't know.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.953
Dave's back?

01:02:28.955 --> 01:02:30.305
Excuse me.

01:02:32.658 --> 01:02:34.342
He's only been back
a few minute

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:35.960
it looks like it's hitting him
pretty hard.

01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:38.296
Well, they were together
for the last year.

01:02:39.566 --> 01:02:41.799
That's the Director.
I'll be right back.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:44.018
Yes, sir.
This is Agent Hotchner.

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.165
Hey, Rossi.

01:02:58.751 --> 01:03:00.668
You all right?

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.787
You don't look so good.

01:03:05.758 --> 01:03:06.958
Get out.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.295
Look, I know this has
gotta be tough on you--

01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:11.846
hey.

01:03:11.848 --> 01:03:14.299
Rossi, what the hell
are you doing?

01:03:25.819 --> 01:03:29.038
Rossi, put the gun down.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.290
Rossi.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:35.878
What's going on?

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.582
Morgan's DNA
was on the glass

01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:41.167
that cut her wrist.

01:03:41.169 --> 01:03:42.835
Strauss?

01:03:42.837 --> 01:03:44.087
You did that.

01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:45.221
No, I didn't.

01:03:45.223 --> 01:03:47.056
Dave, someone on the inside
is doing this.

01:03:47.058 --> 01:03:48.308
You're looking at him.

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:50.927
Derek did not hurt her, and
you have to trust me on this.

01:03:50.929 --> 01:03:51.698
Trust you?

01:03:51.723 --> 01:03:54.348
I bet you told Erin
the same thing.

01:03:54.399 --> 01:03:56.316
Look what that got her.

01:03:56.318 --> 01:03:58.318
Dave, you've been drugged.

01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:03.990
I was too late, Erin.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.528
I'm so sorry.

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:10.997
He wants us
against each other.

01:04:10.999 --> 01:04:13.333
If you pull that trigger,
he wins.

01:04:15.336 --> 01:04:17.003
She's not there.

01:04:22.543 --> 01:04:23.843
Give me the gun.

01:04:23.845 --> 01:04:26.462
I'm gonna call
the paramedics.

01:04:26.464 --> 01:04:29.432
Sit down. It's all right.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.560
They've given him a sedative

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:49.536
and they're going to
take him to the infirmary.

01:04:49.537 --> 01:04:50.820
He's gonna be ok.

01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:52.188
How did it get
into his system?

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:53.456
The report must have
been dusted

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:55.041
with whatever
he used on Strauss.

01:04:55.043 --> 01:04:56.609
Luckily the transdermal
absorption rate

01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:58.211
was lower than
her ingestion of it,

01:04:58.213 --> 01:04:59.679
so it wasn't fatal
for Rossi.

01:04:59.681 --> 01:05:00.913
Then this was a warning.

01:05:00.915 --> 01:05:03.449
If he wanted to kill Rossi,
he had every chance to do it.

01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:05.118
If this is
his endgame,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.652
why is he wasting
time with warnings?

01:05:06.654 --> 01:05:09.756
He's toying with us
and we're playing into him.

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:11.090
He's turned Rossi
against Morgan.

01:05:11.092 --> 01:05:13.059
Even if it was temporary, he wanted
to show it could be done.

01:05:13.061 --> 01:05:14.377
But why?

01:05:14.379 --> 01:05:16.545
Strauss was dosed with a
chemical cousin of Doctor Death.

01:05:16.547 --> 01:05:19.849
He altered it so her torture
would be longer.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.489
A biochemist, computer hacker,
and federal agent?

01:05:26.491 --> 01:05:28.391
Who the hell is this guy?

01:05:28.393 --> 01:05:29.892
Only half the cameras
are working

01:05:29.894 --> 01:05:31.077
because the system
is still rebooting itself,

01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:32.412
so the security guards
have to go old school.

01:05:32.414 --> 01:05:34.063
That means everyone
has to sign in.

01:05:34.065 --> 01:05:35.531
You can't take your I.D.
And run it through--

01:05:35.533 --> 01:05:36.699
well, you know
what old school means.

01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:38.567
So, if you have a badge,
you don't get harassed.

01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:41.304
The man who signed in
to see Rossi

01:05:41.306 --> 01:05:42.755
went up to the sixth floor,

01:05:42.757 --> 01:05:45.792
held the door open
for Kevin and Anderson...

01:05:45.794 --> 01:05:46.959
I can't believe
he was right there.

01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:49.095
Walked through our BAU
into Rossi's office,

01:05:49.097 --> 01:05:50.797
signed in as Adam Worth.

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.432
Adam Worth?

01:05:52.434 --> 01:05:55.802
Isn't that the same alias
he used when Maeve went missing?

01:05:55.804 --> 01:05:57.103
Yeah, which means
it's not just a taunt.

01:05:57.105 --> 01:05:58.438
It speaks directly
to his psychology.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.390
Adam Worth was a famous criminal
from the late 1800s,

01:06:00.392 --> 01:06:02.275
commonly referred to
as the Napoleon of Crime.

01:06:02.277 --> 01:06:04.427
This unsub obviously
sees himself in the same light.

01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:06.262
So this guy is a malignant
narcissist

01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:08.531
who wants to be known as the
worst enemy we've ever had.

01:06:08.533 --> 01:06:11.634
And look, he's careful to hide
his face from the cameras.

01:06:11.636 --> 01:06:14.070
Because he knows
exactly where they are.

01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:39.979
The Replicator has directly
taunted everyone on this team

01:06:39.981 --> 01:06:41.848
except for me.

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:43.683
You may be part
of his endgame.

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:45.151
Then so was Strauss.

01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:48.271
He chose to use drugs
as his final replication.

01:06:48.273 --> 01:06:49.355
That's no accident.

01:06:49.357 --> 01:06:50.907
Is that a connection
to you?

01:06:50.909 --> 01:06:54.143
Strauss and I had issues
during the Amerithrax case.

01:06:54.145 --> 01:06:55.445
It started in New York
with poison.

01:06:55.447 --> 01:06:57.447
And it was delivered
by envelopes.

01:06:57.449 --> 01:06:58.948
Why would anyone
on the inside

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.533
hold resentment
over that case?

01:07:00.535 --> 01:07:02.818
Because that person suffered
a professional setback

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.871
just like Blake, but was patient
and psychotic enough

01:07:04.873 --> 01:07:06.622
to get revenge.

01:07:06.624 --> 01:07:09.008
I am all over the DOJ names
including support staff.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:11.377
I have Kevin pulling
files and photos.

01:07:11.379 --> 01:07:14.297
System is down, so it's hard
to check entire career paths,

01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:17.350
but there were two agents
in New York in 2001.

01:07:17.352 --> 01:07:19.936
Scratch that--Lehman
died in October--

01:07:19.938 --> 01:07:21.637
that leaves Curtis.

01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:24.357
Wait a second?
John Curtis?

01:07:24.359 --> 01:07:26.359
You know him?

01:07:26.361 --> 01:07:28.344
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

01:07:28.346 --> 01:07:30.012
He was a nice guy.

01:07:30.014 --> 01:07:31.614
We were first office
agents together,

01:07:31.616 --> 01:07:34.400
but I thought he left the Bureau
after the Amerithrax case.

01:07:34.402 --> 01:07:37.904
Could it be him?
Does he fit the profile?

01:07:37.906 --> 01:07:40.907
He was quiet and a loner,
but brilliant.

01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:44.193
He specialized
in a lot of fields,

01:07:44.195 --> 01:07:45.711
but his passion

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:48.414
was biochemistry.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:18.194
He inherited a family
compound in rural Virginia.

01:08:18.196 --> 01:08:19.444
Coordinates
on on your phone.

01:08:19.447 --> 01:08:20.947
What else do you have
on Curtis?

01:08:20.948 --> 01:08:23.332
Just like you thought.
John Curtis was demoted in the FBI

01:08:23.334 --> 01:08:24.733
after the Amerithrax case.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.903
He was slated to take over
the coveted New York field office,

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:29.872
but then was shipped
to the not coveted Kansas City one.

01:08:29.874 --> 01:08:31.474
He worked there
for many years quietly

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.609
before he was able to weasel
his way back into the nation's capital.

01:08:33.611 --> 01:08:35.578
On paper he is a rock star.

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.264
He immediately transferred
to the Department of Justice,

01:08:38.265 --> 01:08:39.881
the intelligence
oversight section.

01:08:39.884 --> 01:08:41.216
He's a genius
on multiple levels.

01:08:41.219 --> 01:08:42.385
What's his background?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:43.935
Only child, parents died
when he was 18.

01:08:43.938 --> 01:08:46.055
Never married. Total loner,
just like Blake said.

01:08:46.057 --> 01:08:48.057
Then all he's ever
had to care about is his work.

01:08:48.059 --> 01:08:50.091
And when he lost that,
he snapped.

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:31.600
HRT will divide us up
when we land.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:37.640
As you can see from the geo ref'd
he's got plenty of privacy.

01:09:37.642 --> 01:09:40.493
5 1/2 acres, 3 structures,
house included.

01:09:41.495 --> 01:09:42.912
Garcia.

01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:44.162
I see it, too, sir.

01:09:44.165 --> 01:09:46.381
It must be some sort
of system override.

01:09:58.712 --> 01:10:00.763
What's happening?

01:10:00.765 --> 01:10:02.214
Autopilot's seized.

01:10:02.216 --> 01:10:04.383
Mayday.
Oh, God.

01:10:17.364 --> 01:10:18.698
I got it back.

01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:21.067
Are you ok?

01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:22.518
We're stabilizing.

01:10:41.588 --> 01:10:43.556
Brace for impact.

01:10:43.558 --> 01:10:46.041
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:49.995
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

01:11:12.615 --> 01:11:14.265
I can't get through
to any of them.

01:11:14.267 --> 01:11:16.434
We have agents
in those choppers.

01:11:16.436 --> 01:11:18.987
It was only one.
The first is circling back now.

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.172
Are they ok?

01:11:21.624 --> 01:11:23.208
Copy.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.109
Ok, as a precaution,
they separated

01:11:25.111 --> 01:11:27.295
to land on opposite
sides of the property,

01:11:27.297 --> 01:11:30.048
and the controls were taken over
by a remote override.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.951
Which can only happen
within a 5-mile radius.

01:11:32.953 --> 01:11:35.086
He knew they were coming.

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:37.622
And how they were
getting there.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.818
Are you guys all right?

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.902
Yeah.

01:11:50.904 --> 01:11:52.070
Where's Blake?

01:11:56.526 --> 01:11:57.826
What the hell is this?

01:11:57.828 --> 01:12:01.363
What is this?

01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:35.614
Ohh...

01:12:35.616 --> 01:12:37.365
We're back in business.

01:12:38.568 --> 01:12:40.068
Thank you.

01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:45.490
Sir.

01:12:45.492 --> 01:12:46.658
Where is everybody?

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.210
Right this second,
in a field.

01:12:49.212 --> 01:12:51.580
If he'd wanted to kill all of us,
he could have.

01:12:51.582 --> 01:12:54.049
He's playing God,
just like he's done all year.

01:12:54.051 --> 01:12:55.533
He hard-landed us,
knocked us out

01:12:55.535 --> 01:12:57.802
with whatever was in those
canister he could take Blake.

01:12:57.804 --> 01:12:59.704
He had plenty of chances
to take her before tonight.

01:12:59.706 --> 01:13:01.923
He wants it to be a spectacle.

01:13:32.755 --> 01:13:34.139
What do you want?

01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:35.790
You're the profiler.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.375
You tell me.

01:13:37.377 --> 01:13:38.910
You don't want to know.

01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:41.079
Reverse psychology.

01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:43.765
I'm not going to beg
for your analysis.

01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.934
You don't have to beg.

01:13:45.936 --> 01:13:49.771
I already know how
desperate you are for it.

01:13:52.942 --> 01:13:55.777
I didn't remember you
being so skittish.

01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:58.446
You've never seen me
in chains before?

01:13:58.448 --> 01:14:01.449
I've seen you with
your hands tied, so to speak.

01:14:01.451 --> 01:14:04.452
Erin Strauss and the Bureau
discarded us.

01:14:04.454 --> 01:14:06.588
We were the forgotten ones.

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:08.056
They forgot you.

01:14:08.058 --> 01:14:09.691
I did all right.

01:14:09.693 --> 01:14:12.927
But they'll remember me now.

01:14:14.463 --> 01:14:16.965
You know, I admired you
back then,

01:14:16.967 --> 01:14:19.668
leading the charge
on the day it all changed,

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.237
the day Erin Strauss
ruined us.

01:14:23.939 --> 01:14:25.340
I sat next to you.

01:14:25.342 --> 01:14:29.177
Borrowed your pen
to sign my transfer.

01:14:30.479 --> 01:14:33.548
They put me in Kansas.

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:34.983
Me.

01:14:35.885 --> 01:14:37.485
You know what
I've been wondering?

01:14:37.487 --> 01:14:40.255
Why did Strauss
change her mind about you?

01:14:40.257 --> 01:14:43.825
I kept my head down
and I worked hard.

01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:47.295
We all did.

01:14:47.297 --> 01:14:50.782
But you got my chance.

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:01.042
We're ready
to breach the house.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:03.554
Which way did he go?

01:16:03.556 --> 01:16:05.657
I don't know.

01:16:05.659 --> 01:16:08.827
Morgan, you and JJ find him.
We've got this.

01:16:08.829 --> 01:16:10.779
He said he used 8 locks

01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:13.198
because there used to be
8 of us.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.833
That's all he said?

01:16:14.835 --> 01:16:16.417
About that, yes.

01:16:16.419 --> 01:16:18.036
There's only 6 keys. That mean
two keys will be used twice.

01:16:18.038 --> 01:16:21.256
Each key is a letter, likely corresponds
to a number on the locks.

01:16:21.258 --> 01:16:23.407
7--seventh letter
of the alphabet's "G."

01:16:23.409 --> 01:16:24.542
What are the other letters?

01:16:24.544 --> 01:16:27.796
Um, Z, U, W--

01:16:27.798 --> 01:16:28.963
Zugzwang.

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:33.601
It's too easy.

01:16:49.652 --> 01:16:51.786
Morgan?

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.305
He's got the placed lined with C-4.
We've only got 3 minutes.

01:17:10.307 --> 01:17:11.806
This seems too easy.

01:17:11.808 --> 01:17:13.424
Zugzwang almost means
a dilemma in chess

01:17:13.426 --> 01:17:15.977
where the best move
is not to move at all.

01:17:17.563 --> 01:17:18.930
Wait, don't get up!

01:17:20.182 --> 01:17:22.133
It's a pressure sensor.

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.176
They've gotta hurry.

01:17:48.178 --> 01:17:51.095
Sir, I can't block
this thing off for long.

01:18:02.191 --> 01:18:03.942
Drop the gun.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:13.368
You'd really die for them?

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:15.186
That's the oath
we all took.

01:18:15.188 --> 01:18:17.405
To protect our country
from people like you,

01:18:17.407 --> 01:18:18.689
no matter what.

01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:21.859
You never appreciated me,
none of you.

01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:25.997
I gave you my life,
and you rejected me.

01:18:25.999 --> 01:18:28.700
You can tell me
your sob story while walking.

01:18:39.895 --> 01:18:43.431
Everybody get back!
There's C-4 in the basement.

01:18:43.433 --> 01:18:45.900
Everybody back!

01:18:45.902 --> 01:18:48.236
Wait, where's Rossi?

01:18:48.238 --> 01:18:50.188
He was right behind me.

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:51.272
Dave!

01:18:51.274 --> 01:18:53.241
He just let us out.
Why would he go back in?

01:18:56.278 --> 01:18:58.997
We'll go out as heroes.

01:18:58.999 --> 01:19:00.949
I'm not so sure
about that.

01:19:09.574 --> 01:19:11.709
Zugzwang.

she was one hell

Um...do you guys
remember that one time

01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:19.087
that she called me, but I thought
that it was somebody else?

01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:21.705
Oh, no.
That was funny.

01:21:21.707 --> 01:21:23.141
Oh, maybe to you.
I was mortified.

01:21:23.143 --> 01:21:24.392

01:21:24.394 --> 01:21:26.427

01:21:26.429 --> 01:21:27.929
Yes, she did.

01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:29.097
That's my girl.

01:21:29.099 --> 01:21:30.881

01:21:30.883 --> 01:21:32.400

we had a...

01:22:10.923 --> 01:22:14.258
very different celebration.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.926
Of life,

01:22:15.928 --> 01:22:18.062
of love,

01:22:18.064 --> 01:22:20.281
and good people.

01:22:23.435 --> 01:22:27.938
This year it's the, uh,
other side of that.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.460
Because, well...

01:22:32.462 --> 01:22:34.829
that's what families do.

01:22:37.115 --> 01:22:39.550
It's been a hard year.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.256
But tonight...

01:22:45.258 --> 01:22:49.594
We celebrate
a life well lived...

01:22:49.596 --> 01:22:51.679
Well loved...

01:22:55.901 --> 01:22:57.485
To a good woman...

01:22:59.988 --> 01:23:02.323
An even better mother...

01:23:02.325 --> 01:23:04.909
To our friend...

01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:13.000
