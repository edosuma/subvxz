WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.230
SOLDIERS CRY OUT

00:06.760 --> 00:08.478
Get to Troy.
<i>—</i> Briseis.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.197
HARMON:
I can't unsee it, madam.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.279
I know how much I'm asking of you.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.998
Since I was forced

00:18.040 --> 00:19.872
to give up something precious
at your demand

00:20.440 --> 00:21.555
I want her.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.955
You fight alone now.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.440
They're proposing a duel.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.634
HELEN:
It's a trick.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.390
The prophecy-

00:35.640 --> 00:38.393
For Troy to live, you have to die.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.590
SHE CRIES QUIETLY

01:31.240 --> 01:32.469
KNOCK AT DOOR

01:34.480 --> 01:36.039
DOOR OPENS

01:37.040 --> 01:38.269
PANDARUS:
You asked to see me.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.675
I asked for news.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.717
The men we sent out didn't find him.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.356
How many did you send?

01:55.160 --> 01:57.629
It's not easy, as you know,
to get men out of the city.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.874
And even harder to get them back in.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.870
How many?

02:05.840 --> 02:06.830
Five men.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.429
Is that all he's worth?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.557
It's not about worth, it's about risk.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.076
There will be Greek soldiers
combing the hills

02:14.160 --> 02:15.355
desperate for his head.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.878
He'll die at their hands.
<i>—</i> I'm afraid that might well be his fate.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.473
Send them back out, now.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.638
That is not a decision I or you can make.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.909
All Trojan lives are of value,
not just Alexander's.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.791
And there are voices suggesting
he should not return to the city at all.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.315
What do you mean by that?

02:35.320 --> 02:36.310
You heard the priest.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.511
Get out.

02:43.000 --> 02:43.831
|\/|y lady.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.473
MAN SHOUTS:
By the trees on the right!

03:15.200 --> 03:17.430
MEN SHOUT IN DISTANCE

03:21.480 --> 03:22.709
MAN:
The trees on the right!

03:26.760 --> 03:29.195
MEN SHOUT

03:30.400 --> 03:31.470
MAN:
Find the coward!

04:02.000 --> 04:05.152
HECUBA: Priam, he's coming now.
You need to talk to him.

04:09.160 --> 04:09.991
Tell her.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.674
Tell her to her face what you did.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.478
They already know.
<i>—</i> I want you to hear it from them.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.749
What is this? Get her out of here.
<i>—</i> Don't move, Cassandra.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.079
HECTOR:
Will you speak or shall I?

04:23.960 --> 04:24.791
And say what?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.914
You sent your new-born son to his death.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.596
You told your other children
that wolves stole him

04:31.680 --> 04:32.875
forced your wife to play along.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.713
Luckily, the man you employed
for the task disobeyed your command.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.757
That is the only reason
Alexander's still alive.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.915
Because a simple shepherd
had a heart you never did.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.673
I did what I thought was best
for the city.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.070
I don't have to apologise to you
or anyone for that.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.309
What about her?

04:46.360 --> 04:49.159
She had a vision that Alexander
would burn the city to the ground.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.232
Black blood would flow in the street.
You told her she was mad.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.150
You locked her up.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.629
You told me that my sister was disturbed,
that I couldn't see her

05:01.720 --> 05:03.233
that she needed constant care.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.914
That she shouldn't be allowed out to play
like other children.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.874
She was seven years old.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.839
I don't want to be in here.
<i>—</i> Stay where you are, Cassandra.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.718
When Alexander came back,
you lied again.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.670
To save his life.
<i>—</i> You lied and you lied

05:18.760 --> 05:21.195
and now you hide away in you room...
<i>—</i> PRIAM: To save his life.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.633
What kind of a coward are you?
<i>—</i> Please let me go.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.509
Let her go, Hector.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.633
HECUBA:
Your father didn't force me.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.755
What we did, we did together.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.511
Are you saying you gave away your son
voluntarily?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.274
You lied to your children.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.350
You lied, too.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.313
PRIAM:
You met Litos in Cilicia.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.951
He warned you to stop Alexander
from returning.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.190
Yes. I did meet Litos.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.429
Perhaps I should have obeyed him.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.233
HECTOR:
I had the chance and I failed.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.676
I'm telling Pandarus
to call off the search for Alexander.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.591
HECUBA:
What?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.354
But the Greeks will find him.
You know what they'll do to him.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.351
The gods have been clear.
He cannot be in Troy.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.394
But he's your blood.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.150
The risk is too great.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.711
Sorry.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.038
I'm taking over the running
of the city now.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.672
I think it's for the best. Don't you?

06:56.080 --> 06:56.911
What about Helen?

06:58.800 --> 06:59.631
What do you mean?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.835
Well, Alexander's gone.
What reason do we have to keep her?

07:05.480 --> 07:06.436
You mean give her back?

07:08.240 --> 07:11.073
The Greeks have butchered your father.
You want to reward that with a trophy?

07:11.160 --> 07:14.391
I just want my child to grow up in a city
not at risk of extinction.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.391
No.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.833
When Greek blood decorates our walls,
we'll decide on Helen's fate.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.397
And in the meantime,
what do we do with her?

07:57.760 --> 07:58.830
They won't hand her over.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.277
NESTOR:
The boy's gone. Why keep her now?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.874
Afraid we'll humiliate them.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.120
Financially and politically.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.556
I won that duel.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.914
The terms were specific.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.595
Immediate surrender

08:15.240 --> 08:16.389
and the return of my wife.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.437
ODYSSEUS:
Trickery got you the advantage, Menelaus.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.875
I'm not sure you can claim
the moral high ground.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.033
It was your idea to use the priest.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.313
To weaken the prince's resolve,
but you missed your chance.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.754
I didn't miss my chance.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.714
ODYSSEUS:
You didn't kill him.

08:35.039 --> 08:35.916
You say that again.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.030
You didn't kill him.
— MENELAUS YELLS

08:45.560 --> 08:47.153
Put your swords away.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.679
They have reneged
on the conditions of the duel.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.630
Alexander fled.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.912
Lost all rights to her and to his life.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.029
And I want that coward found.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.756
I have men roaming the hills.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.433
AGAMEMNON:
Then double the numbers.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.159
I want him brought here
for my brother's satisfaction

09:25.640 --> 09:26.471
and for my own.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.355
May I eat with you?

10:41.880 --> 10:42.711
Get her food.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.714
What's happened to our rooms?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.713
Where are Paris's things?

11:18.840 --> 11:20.069
Alexander isn't coming back.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.435
What about the search parties?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.550
We've called them off.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.633
I'm afraid it's too dangerous.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.189
What authority do you have
to make that decision?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.030
I'm running things now.

11:38.080 --> 11:38.990
HECTOR:
Alexander...

11:40.400 --> 11:41.390
He knows the hills well.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.790
He will reach safety.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.078
How can you possibly know that?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.115
HELEN:
If Paris is gone...

11:53.360 --> 11:55.033
there's no reason for me to be here...

11:56.040 --> 11:56.871
is there?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.439
You should return me to Menelaus.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.033
We've no intention of returning you.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.670
When the war is won, we'll give
you and Alexander a life together.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.630
But not here.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.675
Somewhere safe.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.070
If he's still alive.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.430
In the meantime

12:15.520 --> 12:19.036
we think it's best if you stay
out of the public gaze for a while

12:20.000 --> 12:21.877
until we know better
the feelings of the city.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.075
Helen, people are nervous.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.030
They blame the outsider
for their own sins.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.712
We don't want to put you in any danger.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.634
How kind of you to think of me.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.758
We've arranged for you to go
to the widows' quarters for a while.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.074
They will feed you, look after you.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.275
The widows' quarters?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.432
ANDROMACHE:
It's somewhere safe and quiet.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.352
My husband isn't dead.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.351
Yet.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.031
MAN: Watch out.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.312
Bad move.
<i>—</i> MAN SHOUTS

13:29.440 --> 13:31.556
SOLDIER: Slit that Trojan
from arse to mouth when I find him.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.670
MAN LAUGHS

13:34.320 --> 13:36.436
ROCKS TRICKLE AWAY
<i>—</i> Shh.

13:39.960 --> 13:40.791
MAN: What is it?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.395
MAN IN DISTANCE:
Come on!

14:17.320 --> 14:18.276
May I come in?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.194
I wanted to tell you.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.711
You see

14:42.360 --> 14:44.112
I lived with all of this for so long...

14:45.920 --> 14:47.593
that I just became accustomed to it.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.870
And for that I shall never forgive myself.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.631
Do you understand?

15:00.440 --> 15:02.113
I don't expect anything from you.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.318
I just want you to have your life back...
<i>—</i> I can't be here, I'm sorry.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.598
We find him
and we bring him back here!

15:29.800 --> 15:30.631
Move out!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.118
Why do we do all the dirty work?

15:38.880 --> 15:41.838
Meanwhile Achilles sits in his tent
sulking and refusing to fight.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.399
He's too busy scaling his lover boy
to scale the city.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.434
AENEAS:
Tell him what you heard.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.996
Achilles and the Myrmidons
are refusing to fight.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.278
AENEAS:
That's 500 of their best men.

16:13.080 --> 16:13.911
Why would he refuse?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.789
They didn't say.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.592
It explains why they proposed the deal.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.833
They're worried that without Achilles,
they don't have the power to beat us.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.196
Then we have to move quickly
before he changes his mind.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.754
Troilus, Deiphobus,
enlist more of the city.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.558
All men over 14 and under 40.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.393
14 is young.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.917
Well, let's hope we don't have to use them.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.873
HECTOR: You're from Cilicia?
<i>—</i> Sir.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.594
What were you doing out there?
<i>—</i> I was looking for my sister.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.955
She was taken by Achilles.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.873
I wanted to know if she's still alive.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.310
HECTOR: And is she?
<i>—</i> For now.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.749
I want to sign up.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.190
Age?
—15.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.477
Name?
<i>—</i> Hesion, son of Philemon.

17:15.000 --> 17:15.830
Alright.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.878
Meet at the training grounds.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.470
I want to fight, too.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.471
How old are you?
<i>—</i> I'm 14.

17:24.119 --> 17:24.951
He's nine.

17:30.080 --> 17:30.911
Not today.

17:34.080 --> 17:34.911
Keep practising.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.595
Anyone else in the house?

17:38.720 --> 17:41.189
Just a trader from Thrace,
but we haven't seen him for weeks.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.113
SOLDIER:
This is where he lives, my lord.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.680
PANDARUS:
Harmon?

18:32.760 --> 18:35.115
When did you last see him?
<i>—</i> Must be weeks ago.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.671
It's not like him.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.470
Harmon's no deserter.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.434
Put your feelers out.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.511
Anything strange that happens
in the palace

18:49.600 --> 18:50.795
anything out of the ordinary

18:52.000 --> 18:52.831
I want to know.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.514
MAID:
This came for you, madam.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.109
A man at the back gate. Said he's a friend.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.271
Thank you.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.435
<i>HER BREATH TREMBLES</i>

20:10.040 --> 20:11.235
MAID:
Are you ready, madam?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.635
Now you get your wish.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.598
Believe it or not,
I'm actually doing this to protect you.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.319
Why do you hate me, Andromache?

20:40.800 --> 20:41.835
I tried to help you.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.913
With some success, I think.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.038
Some quack potion you brought with you
from Sparta to keep your skin soft?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.554
This baby is mine.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.277
I thank the gods for its omens.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.509
Not you.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.555
I did force you.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.033
To give Alexander up.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.830
You didn't force me.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.554
You persuaded me...

21:19.760 --> 21:21.512
to sacrifice one life

21:22.880 --> 21:23.995
for all lives.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.712
And now we have to face what we did...

21:32.640 --> 21:33.630
together.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.280
I keep... I keep thinking about him

21:43.560 --> 21:44.391
out there...

21:46.360 --> 21:47.191
all alone...

21:48.600 --> 21:50.637
hunted like an animal.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.038
PRIAM:
You know, when he came back...

21:59.360 --> 22:01.795
I honestly thought

22:02.600 --> 22:04.079
the gods had forgiven us.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.630
I thought it was the chance to start anew.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.352
What do the gods want from us, Hecuba?

22:31.560 --> 22:34.313
MAN GRUNTS

22:38.160 --> 22:39.116
Agelaus.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.675
Get back!
<i>—</i> It's me.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.191
It's just me.

22:46.120 --> 22:46.951
Paris.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.269
I'm sorry I scared you.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.478
Does your family know you're here?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.956
Where's Cantenaus?
<i>—</i> Long gone.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.797
Married a girl from the island,
the lucky boy.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.949
I found out the truth.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.151
Did you go against the king's orders...

23:25.040 --> 23:26.314
and save my life?

23:29.960 --> 23:30.791
I couldn't do it.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.679
Brought you back here.
Thought I'd raise you as one of my own.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.195
Why didn't you tell me?

23:39.600 --> 23:40.999
I did what I thought was right.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.751
Did I do wrong?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.315
I lost a duel.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.589
To Menelaus.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.235
I fled the field of battle.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.477
I've brought shame on the whole city.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.835
I don't know where to go.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.672
SOLDIER:
Seven, eight, nine!

24:21.080 --> 24:22.832
You, you, centre.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.600
One, two, three, four.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.989
BOY LAUGHS

25:01.760 --> 25:03.876
DOG WHIMPERS

25:11.360 --> 25:12.191
<i>Hey-</i>

25:12.880 --> 25:13.711
How are you?

25:15.720 --> 25:16.551
Where did you go?

25:17.880 --> 25:19.359
The recruiters want you for battle.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.637
Oh, you know me. I'm no fighter.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.236
It's good to see you.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.993
Please, sit, have some food.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.353
EVANDER GASPS QUIETLY

25:34.560 --> 25:37.074
What are you looking at?
Never seen goat's blood before?

25:38.760 --> 25:40.159
Look. What about this place? Huh?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.920
Some Minoans used to live here.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.629
It's not bad, is it?

25:45.680 --> 25:47.353
Please, sit. You're making me nervous.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.316
You look hungry.
I'll get you something.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.995
Beans alright?

26:25.240 --> 26:27.629
What's Helen doing here?
<i>—</i> I don't know.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.069
THEY WHISPER INDISTINCTLY

26:34.000 --> 26:35.195
WOMAN:
Would you like to try?

26:39.720 --> 26:40.949
I don't know how to do it.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.471
I'll teach you.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.150
I'm Adrasteia.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.151
Helen.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.511
We know.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.839
Is everyone here a widow?

27:00.120 --> 27:01.030
Not everyone.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.756
But most of us.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.634
Did yours die in battle?

27:07.800 --> 27:08.949
Don't feel bad.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.550
He was a brutal bastard.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.514
I thought about doing it myself.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.436
You're missing him?

27:30.720 --> 27:31.755
Well, we're here for you.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.595
Whatever you need.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.629
HELEN:
What is she doing here?

27:43.240 --> 27:45.436
ADRASTEIA:
We're helping her return to normal life.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.154
I—lesion's going to fight.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.790
Brave boy.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.711
What if he dies?

28:05.320 --> 28:06.151
He won't.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.711
How do you know?

28:10.560 --> 28:11.470
My third eye.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.910
Listen, it's getting late. You should go.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.110
And Evander...

28:19.560 --> 28:21.198
you probably shouldn't come back here.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.191
Why not?

28:24.280 --> 28:26.749
Well, I should be fighting for the city
that's taken me in.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.794
If soldiers find me here...

28:29.200 --> 28:30.349
You'll be scared?

28:31.960 --> 28:32.791
Terrified.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.474
Does that mean you're a coward?

28:35.960 --> 28:38.349
Yes. I suppose it does.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.594
Listen. Your brother is worth ten of me.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.790
So go back to him and your grandmother,
and don't tell anyone you saw me. Alright?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.071
Good. Go on.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.193
PANDARUS:
You took a gift to Queen Helen.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.630
Who gave it to you?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.274
He didn't give a name, sir.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.595
Describe him.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.875
I didn't see his face.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.630
Stature?
<i>—</i> Smaller than you.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.270
What was the gift?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.118
It was wrapped in a cloth, sir.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.311
Who are you?

30:13.160 --> 30:13.991
I'm a friend.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.915
I don't need a friend.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.398
You needed someone to clear up after you.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.431
That servant was about to betray you.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.390
What did you do to him?

30:29.520 --> 30:30.999
I fulfilled Achilles' command.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.394
I've been charged with your care
while you remain in the city.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.311
You're lying.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.874
What do you want from me?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.191
Money?

30:41.840 --> 30:42.830
Merely to protect you.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.350
For your return.
<i>—</i> I'll never return.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.920
Everything I have done,
I've done for my love.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.669
And now you are alone.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.436
Your lover has gone.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.031
You have secrets that need protection.

30:58.680 --> 30:59.511
Listen.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.479
I never asked for your help
and I never will.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.634
Go back to your Greeks and tell them
I don't want to see them or you again.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.593
Your beauty is different close up.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.070
<i>Just go.</i>

31:26.640 --> 31:30.110
Lord Pandarus is making enquiries
into your servant's disappearance.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.511
Be careful.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.191
It's good.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.798
Tastier than anything in Troy.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.753
What happened to that woman you stole?

31:54.240 --> 31:55.071
It's over.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.715
Don't you love her?

31:58.600 --> 31:59.431
More than ever.

32:01.080 --> 32:01.911
But I lost.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.713
So they have to give Helen back to Menelaus,
it's the code of war.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.835
They probably already have.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.869
What if I'd never left here?

32:17.040 --> 32:17.950
But you did.

32:18.840 --> 32:19.671
BIRD SQUAWKS

32:20.640 --> 32:23.314
Paris, I'm an old man.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.231
BIRD SQUAWKS

32:25.320 --> 32:26.230
I can't protect you.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.313
APHRODITE:
The boy has suffered enough.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.877
Priam should have killed the baby himself.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.159
Then none of this need have happened.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.115
You set the whole thing up.

32:39.880 --> 32:40.756
The competition.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.151
Helen.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.517
All just to satisfy the omens.
<i>—</i> No.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.029
I gave the boy a chance
to seize his own destiny.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.590
And he took it.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.550
Forgive him.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.391
For me.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.070
The thing is...

33:18.920 --> 33:20.433
forgiveness isn't their way.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.231
Is it?

33:25.400 --> 33:26.470
I won't let you take him.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.429
HECTOR:
Be at the ready.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.952
We'll be back.
<i>—</i> Yes, my lord.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.670
MAN SHOUTS
<i>—</i> What the hell are they doing?

34:37.960 --> 34:38.995
ODYSSEUS:
Hector.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.233
Finally agreeing to abide
by the conditions of the duel?

34:52.199 --> 34:54.032
We know you lack Achilles
and the Myrmidons.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.592
I don't know where you get
your information.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.399
Then why haven't you attacked us?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.478
We broke the code of war
not giving Helen back.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.516
There must be a reason.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.840
The answer to that question...

35:19.720 --> 35:21.233
is that I whipped your brother.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.239
And I'll do the same to you.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.035
Tell Agamemnon you have until morning
to leave our soil.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.671
Then we'll send a hundred horses
into your camp

35:36.760 --> 35:38.558
and murder each and every one of you.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.439
We outnumber you two-to-one
and we're in no mood for mercy.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.153
I will talk to my king.

35:52.080 --> 35:52.911
By sunrise

35:54.040 --> 35:55.189
you need to be gone.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.195
PANDARUS: If she says anything at all,
come straight to me.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.391
Understood?

38:45.640 --> 38:46.471
SHE INHALES SHARPLY

38:51.360 --> 38:52.316
What will you do to him?

38:55.440 --> 38:56.475
Leave that to me.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.950
Don't hurt him.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.155
Just get him out of the city.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.632
I'll need to get to his private rooms.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.199
I can't let you in the palace.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.070
That would be treason.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.072
Lord Pandarus is a determined man.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.909
He will find out the truth.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.629
Unless you open that door.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.274
MAN SHOUTS ORDERS

40:17.360 --> 40:18.395
HECTOR:
Dolon.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.029
Go back out into the plain.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.230
If the Greeks make any move

40:25.080 --> 40:25.911
let me know.

40:26.000 --> 40:26.831
DOLON: Sir.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.634
You think they'll leave?

40:28.880 --> 40:31.156
If they stay
they don't stand a chance, cousin.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.755
We'll ride them into the sea.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.872
ODYSSEUS:
I needed to tell you Hector's demands.

40:47.960 --> 40:48.950
In front of a slave girl?

40:53.840 --> 40:55.160
Oh, you want to leave.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.475
Go on then, leave!

41:01.520 --> 41:03.670
You leave my brother and I
to fight them alone!

41:11.200 --> 41:12.110
Walk out now.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.430
You're a free man. Go on.

41:18.080 --> 41:21.960
No one is recommending leaving.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.595
Oh, that's right.
Because no one is leaving!

41:27.120 --> 41:28.315
AGAMEMNON:
Not without her!

41:32.080 --> 41:32.911
Not alive.

41:44.080 --> 41:44.911
AGAMEMNON:
Wine.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.275
I thought you might come.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.270
When does this stop?

42:08.160 --> 42:09.070
When we're all dead?

42:09.960 --> 42:12.759
ACHILLES: When the king feels in his soul
the wrong he has done me

42:12.840 --> 42:14.194
and gives me back my girl.

42:16.480 --> 42:17.993
That probably won't happen tonight.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.238
ODYSSEUS:
They have twice the numbers.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.514
They have dozens of horses.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.989
You could have Trojan riders in your tent
within hours.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.273
Well, we'll be sure to welcome them.

42:30.000 --> 42:30.831
Won't we?

42:34.120 --> 42:34.951
Patroclus.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.471
ODYSSEUS:
Help me.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.432
See, I'm not like you, Odysseus.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.311
You like to win regardless of the cause.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.356
If I feel the cause is wrong,
I can't move.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.430
My sword won't rise in my hand.
<i>—</i> Stop this. We don't have time.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.832
There's always time for thinking, Nestor.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.829
We need your men,
even if you won't fight.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.399
Give me a reason and I'll fight.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.799
One that isn't rape or pillage.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.119
You show me a higher calling
that demands my power.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.957
Give me cause and I'll give you war.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.595
Can you?

43:18.600 --> 43:19.635
Thought not.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.838
So, in the absence of glory

43:24.680 --> 43:26.910
you'll have to rely on your ways,
Odysseus.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.435
The wiles of man.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.393
They've served you well up till now.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.720
You'll regret this.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.715
I swear by the gods.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.598
What do you know of gods?

43:47.440 --> 43:48.953
NESTOR:
That selfish bastard.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.749
I'll kill him.
<i>—</i> Forget him. We'll do it ourselves.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.596
What's the plan?
<i>—</i> ODYSSEUS: Stupid question.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.639
NESTOR:
It's not a stupid question.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.794
ODYSSEUS:
It is. I haven't got an answer.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.795
ATHENA WHISPERS:
Odysseus.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.478
DOLON GASPS AND WAILS

44:29.920 --> 44:33.072
NESTOR: Odysseus?
— DOLON WHEEZES

44:43.360 --> 44:45.078
ODYSSEUS:
A Trojan spy on the plain.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.590
Are you waiting to see
if we are leaving, boy?

44:58.520 --> 44:59.669
MENELAUS:
Answer the king.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.793
How many men has Hector got?
How many horses?

45:05.400 --> 45:06.231
No!

45:10.480 --> 45:11.550
Do you know this girl?

45:18.560 --> 45:19.880
She means nothing to you?

45:25.120 --> 45:27.680
DOLON SOBS

45:39.880 --> 45:42.190
ODYSSEUS:
One hour, or you know what they'll do to her.

45:42.760 --> 45:43.591
NESTOR:
Go.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.477
What does it feel like to see things?

45:55.560 --> 45:56.630
It's strange.

45:58.560 --> 46:01.871
Like the most wonderful and terrible thing
in the world.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.519
I glimpse beauty for a moment...

46:07.480 --> 46:08.675
pure white light...

46:10.360 --> 46:11.794
and then I see the truth.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.109
Did you know all along...

46:17.520 --> 46:18.715
why Paris must leave?

46:21.200 --> 46:23.237
I saw that he would destroy the city.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.911
Is there really no way he can come back?

46:32.080 --> 46:33.229
Not if he's alive.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.799
Prince Hector wants to speak to you.

47:08.520 --> 47:09.510
Asked me to take over.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.159
HORSES NEIGH LOUDLY

47:59.520 --> 48:00.351
He's done it.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.233
A city of horses no more.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.196
Signal the attack.

48:07.680 --> 48:08.511
Now.

48:15.000 --> 48:15.990
MENELAUS:
Agamemnon!

48:16.080 --> 48:18.993
SOLDIERS SHOUT OUT

48:19.560 --> 48:21.551
We're attacking.
<i>—</i> My sword. Now.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.319
SOLDIERS:
Positions!

48:34.360 --> 48:35.350
Your brother did well.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.550
You should learn from him.

48:47.320 --> 48:48.151
You see?

48:49.680 --> 48:50.954
They didn't need me.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.838
Never underestimate Odysseus.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.871
SOLDIERS CLAMOUR

49:06.800 --> 49:08.154
SOLDIERS:
Go! Move!

49:09.880 --> 49:12.713
Let's go!
— SOLDIERS YELL

49:18.520 --> 49:20.557
The horses,
they're gone from the stables.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.313
What?
<i>—</i> They're gone. All of them.

49:22.720 --> 49:23.551
DEIPHOBUS:
Greeks!

49:25.080 --> 49:25.911
Attacking.

49:26.680 --> 49:29.320
We still have men.
<i>—</i> What, against chariots? Horses?

49:29.760 --> 49:30.591
What's going on?

49:31.280 --> 49:32.350
Someone's let the horses go.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.871
All of them,
and the Greeks are attacking.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.634
Get the men out there now.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.231
NQW!

49:40.320 --> 49:41.958
Move!
<i>—</i> SOLDIERS: Move!

49:42.720 --> 49:43.551
SOLDIER:
Go!

49:43.640 --> 49:47.395
SOLDIERS CLAMOUR

49:48.120 --> 49:49.349
To the wall! Move!

50:15.960 --> 50:17.234
PANDARUS: Who the hell are you?

50:18.480 --> 50:21.074
What are you doing in my rooms?
<i>—</i> I am writing a letter.

50:21.920 --> 50:22.830
To you, actually.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.155
From Menelaus.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.597
You're a traitor, Lord Pandarus.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.075
THUD
— PANDARUS GASPS

50:42.320 --> 50:46.837
CHOKING SOUNDS

51:04.160 --> 51:08.597
WATER SLOSH ES

51:12.560 --> 51:13.391
PARIS:
Oenone?

51:14.440 --> 51:15.271
Paris.

51:18.360 --> 51:19.191
May |?

51:20.960 --> 51:22.633
I've been walking all night.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.790
What are you doing here?

51:36.680 --> 51:38.591
I spent the night
at my father's cottage, but...

51:38.680 --> 51:40.034
Agelaus isn't your father.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.354
Why aren't you in the city?

51:48.240 --> 51:49.275
I can't be there anymore.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.394
What about your Spartan queen?

51:58.640 --> 51:59.471
Why are you here?

52:01.560 --> 52:03.153
I was just walking old paths.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.470
You should go.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.390
What's his name?

52:21.520 --> 52:23.909
Xeno.
<i>—</i> That's a nice name.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.315
Where's his father?

52:28.840 --> 52:29.989
In the fields with the herd.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.598
He gets up early, all the men do.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.391
I need to go.
<i>—</i> Let me meet your husband.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.709
You don't understand, do you?

52:41.480 --> 52:42.754
People know it was you.

52:43.920 --> 52:47.197
They've lost family, friends,
whole villages burnt.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.830
I have to go.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.753
FIRE CRACKLES

55:28.400 --> 55:30.676
MAN:
Move! Move!

56:00.000 --> 56:03.118
Helen!

56:04.120 --> 56:07.397
Helen!

56:12.720 --> 56:13.710
Aphrodite.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.395
Why have you done this to me?

56:18.640 --> 56:19.550
SHE WHISPERS:
No!
