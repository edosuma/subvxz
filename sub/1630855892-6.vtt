-No. This isn't real.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.256
I told you. You didn't believe me.

35:51.340 --> 35:53.135
[Victoria] Now what? Do we call someone?

35:53.219 --> 35:54.680
No, Biddle's dead, okay?

35:54.764 --> 35:56.518
Doesn't mean we have
to ruin our lives too.

We have to bury it where

36:32.213 --> 36:33.758
Okay, my family's cabin in the mountains.

36:33.842 --> 36:35.971
No, let's bury it in my dad's old mine.

36:36.054 --> 36:38.225
Okay, it's closed down
so nobody will ever find it.

36:38.309 --> 36:39.937
[Ben] Look, then we can never, ever talk

36:40.021 --> 36:42.150
about what happened here

[foreboding music playing]

36:51.209 --> 36:54.215
Come on.

36:54.299 --> 36:58.265
So our parents went in
to get the puppet because it's evil.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.353
-Yeah, totally valid, right?
-Yeah.

37:00.436 --> 37:02.023
Yeah. And that's really good,
'cause it means

37:02.106 --> 37:03.192
they're not, like, real murderers.

37:03.275 --> 37:04.695
-[Margot] Yeah.
-[Lucas] Which is great.

37:04.779 --> 37:07.033
Um... What?

37:07.450 --> 37:10.122
Yes, they were actually real murderers.

37:10.206 --> 37:12.920
That's the... that's the
whole point of the story.

37:13.003 --> 37:15.216
Are you kidding?
Your parents were the evil ones.

37:15.299 --> 37:17.680
Which is why Biddle's ghost

37:17.763 --> 37:20.727
is getting back at them by haunting us.

37:20.811 --> 37:23.190
He's making me wanna kill my family.

37:23.273 --> 37:24.275
Yes.

37:24.359 --> 37:25.696
And having Lucas listen to worms

37:25.779 --> 37:26.948
and leaving James for dead.

37:27.031 --> 37:29.327
Okay, you get it. Thank you.

37:29.411 --> 37:31.415
[Lucas] Okay. Yeah.
But this Harold Biddle kid

37:31.498 --> 37:33.168
seems kind of, like, messed up.

37:33.252 --> 37:36.801
And, like, our parents were
probably trying to help him.

37:36.884 --> 37:38.095
Most of our parents, I guess.

37:38.178 --> 37:40.141
No, listen to me.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.309
-What does that mean?
-Yeah, what'd you mean by that?

37:41.393 --> 37:42.395
-[Bratt] No!
-Means whatever you want.

37:42.478 --> 37:45.777
-He didn't mean anything by it.
-No! No! Listen to me.

37:46.153 --> 37:49.451
Your parents bullied Harold.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.956
You understand?
They bullied him constantly.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.294
They bullied him and bullied him
and bullied him.

37:54.377 --> 37:55.881
And then they broke into his house

37:55.964 --> 37:57.801
and they stole his best friend.

37:57.885 --> 38:00.222
-Best friend?
-Yes! His best friend!

38:00.306 --> 38:04.481
And they ended up
killing him in the process.

38:04.565 --> 38:07.905
So, yeah, they're murderers.

38:07.988 --> 38:10.242
I mean, weren't you even listening?

38:10.326 --> 38:12.121
I gotta spell it out for you?

38:12.205 --> 38:15.587
[tense music playing]

38:16.254 --> 38:18.217
[sighs]

38:19.970 --> 38:22.518
[sniffles] Okay.

38:24.855 --> 38:25.899
Mr. Bratt?

38:25.982 --> 38:26.984
What?

38:29.322 --> 38:30.909
How do you know all of this?

38:32.830 --> 38:36.504
[scoffs] Right. The twist.

38:38.257 --> 38:43.016
I know all this because I'm not Mr. Bratt.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.229

38:45.312 --> 38:46.732
