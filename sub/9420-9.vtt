06:41.402 --> 06:42.334
>> Are you staying with your

06:42.336 --> 06:43.335
family?

06:43.337 --> 06:44.302
>> Staying with my cousin, and

06:44.304 --> 06:45.437
then my aunt and uncle live real

06:45.439 --> 06:46.405
close.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.472
>> Have you, like, hit up the

06:47.474 --> 06:49.374
single bar scene down here?

06:49.376 --> 06:50.442
Or is Plenty of Fish like a

06:50.444 --> 06:51.710
better dating option?

06:51.712 --> 06:53.211
>> Oh, I've been to the bar,

06:53.213 --> 06:54.846
but after I started talking to

06:54.848 --> 06:56.047
Ari, I don't really even use

06:56.049 --> 06:57.482
that, so you know...

06:57.484 --> 06:59.017
>> So you're like really "off

06:59.019 --> 07:00.585
the market" for the moment.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.653
>> Yeah.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.621
>> Right.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.322
>> What attracted you to her?

07:04.324 --> 07:05.524
>> Just real easy to get along

07:05.526 --> 07:06.725
with, you know?

07:06.727 --> 07:07.826
She's someone who's easy to talk

07:07.828 --> 07:09.327
to and it's nice just to have

07:09.329 --> 07:10.629
kind of that companion, you

07:10.631 --> 07:11.496
know?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.265
Someone that you can talk to

07:13.267 --> 07:14.466
and not just keep everything

07:14.468 --> 07:15.867
bottled up and...makes me feel

07:15.869 --> 07:17.569
good.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.837
I feel like we been--both kind

07:18.839 --> 07:20.038
of had a rough life at times,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.506
you know.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.942
And, uh...I feel for her on

07:23.944 --> 07:26.144
that, so...

07:26.146 --> 07:27.512
Sorry I'm not answering these

07:27.514 --> 07:28.580
questions--

07:28.582 --> 07:29.815
>> No, no, I mean, so you guys

07:29.817 --> 07:31.716
have talked about your history?

07:31.718 --> 07:32.717
>> Yeah, we've--

07:32.719 --> 07:33.585
>> Personal?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.287
>> We've shared personal stories

07:35.289 --> 07:36.621
and things that have happened

07:36.623 --> 07:39.124
and...kinda don't just do that

07:39.126 --> 07:40.559
with anybody, you know?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.194
>> You obviously feel a physical

07:42.196 --> 07:43.228
attraction.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.229
>> Oh, yeah.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.063
>> Is that reciprocated?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.431
Does she talk to you--like, is

07:46.433 --> 07:47.899
it clear that...

07:47.901 --> 07:49.201
>> Tells me I'm handsome and

07:49.203 --> 07:50.635
all that stuff, so...

07:50.637 --> 07:51.736
>> Well, that's nice.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.138
>> Yeah.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.239
>> This is way out of your

07:54.241 --> 07:55.340
comfort zone.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.408
>> I'm in deep here.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.576
>> Yeah. I mean, your actions

07:57.578 --> 07:58.810
are telling me that you really

07:58.812 --> 08:00.045
care about this girl and that

08:00.047 --> 08:01.313
you really want to know who she

08:01.315 --> 08:02.914
is because...

08:02.916 --> 08:04.549
>> Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.717
I'm ready to settle down and

08:05.719 --> 08:07.085
she's...yeah.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.187
Someone I can be with...for...

08:09.189 --> 08:11.389
possibly forever, you know?

08:11.391 --> 08:12.357
>> Before she mentioned coming

08:12.359 --> 08:13.458
on the show, was there ever any

08:13.460 --> 08:15.360
doubt that she wasn't who you

08:15.362 --> 08:16.728
thought--who you think she is?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.530
>> No, um, we started talking on

08:18.532 --> 08:20.131
that site, pretty much started

08:20.133 --> 08:21.199
texting right away and then

08:21.201 --> 08:22.467
calling each other and then

08:22.469 --> 08:23.602
Skyping right away.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.437
>> And it's just her like this?

08:25.439 --> 08:26.738
>> Yeah, it's always just her

08:26.740 --> 08:27.706
face.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.707
>> What does she say when you

08:28.709 --> 08:30.141
ask her, like, "Hey, can you..."

08:30.143 --> 08:31.276
>> Like, hey, just prop--prop

08:31.278 --> 08:32.177
that up.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.178
>> Right. 'Cause that's what you

08:33.179 --> 08:33.979
do.

08:33.981 --> 08:34.946
>> She's like, "No. I'll just

08:34.948 --> 08:35.714
hold it here."

08:35.716 --> 08:36.780
>> Could it be her weight?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.015
>> That's the only thing I could

08:38.018 --> 08:40.352
ever...really think of.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.653
>> The only thing that just

08:41.655 --> 08:43.488
occurred to me is maybe she's

08:43.490 --> 08:45.190
pregnant?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.092
>> You thought about that?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.593
>> She says she's a virgin,

08:48.595 --> 08:49.861
though, so...

08:49.863 --> 08:51.863
>> All right.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.365
You trust her?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.000
>> I do, I trust her.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.401
I opened up to her, yeah.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.636
Think of her as one of my best

08:57.638 --> 08:58.937
friends, you know, talk to her

08:58.939 --> 09:00.305
about anything, and I am a

09:00.307 --> 09:01.740
little freaked out by all this,

09:01.742 --> 09:03.842
but...she's that person for me,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.010
so that's why I'm here.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.244
>> You agreed to--to come on a

09:06.246 --> 09:08.113
television show, which is a big

09:08.115 --> 09:09.281
deal.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.782
>> I let her know...[ahem], if

09:10.784 --> 09:11.850
you want to meet up, we don't

09:11.852 --> 09:12.918
gotta go this route, you know.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.753
She said, oh, you're gonna be

09:14.755 --> 09:16.288
mad at me, but there's something

09:16.290 --> 09:17.923
I need to tell you.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.057
If it's something that's not

09:19.059 --> 09:20.725
terrible and unforgiveable,

09:20.727 --> 09:21.826
definitely be down to see where

09:21.828 --> 09:22.661
it goes.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.628
>> You talked about that.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.663
>> Yeah. She wants the same

09:24.665 --> 09:25.664
thing.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.765
>> Can we see a picture?

09:26.767 --> 09:27.999
>> Yeah, show us, uh, show us

09:28.001 --> 09:31.937
the...[murmurs].

09:31.939 --> 09:32.837
Here we go, hold on.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.272
"Saving myself for love or

09:34.274 --> 09:35.273
marriage."

09:35.275 --> 09:36.341
>> No sex.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.275
>> No sex.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.310
>> So she wears that right on

09:38.312 --> 09:39.277
her sleeve.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.111
>> No sex, though.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.379
"Profession, beautician.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.714
Very kind, generous, and loving

09:42.716 --> 09:43.915
girl.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.617
I recently had my heart broken.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.118
I'm a Scorpio and very

09:47.120 --> 09:48.286
emotional.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.254
I tend to put my all into

09:49.256 --> 09:50.755
everything that I do."

09:50.757 --> 09:52.157
Oh, she's got, uh, cheek

09:52.159 --> 09:53.858
piercings.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.759
Are you into that?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.294
>> Yeah, it's cool.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.796
>> That looks very different,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.264
but same cheek piercing.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.966
>> Just much darker hair.

10:00.968 --> 10:01.967
I think that's what--

10:01.969 --> 10:03.401
>> But also she looks bigger in

10:03.403 --> 10:05.537
that picture.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.771
>> So is this sort of like the

10:06.773 --> 10:08.006
view that you usually get,

10:08.008 --> 10:08.974
like...

10:08.976 --> 10:09.874
>> Yeah.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.909
>> And is there a cheek piercing

10:10.911 --> 10:11.776
too?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.877
>> Mm-hmm.

10:12.879 --> 10:13.845
>> We'd like to at least prepare

10:13.847 --> 10:15.013
you so you're not going in

10:15.015 --> 10:16.615
blind.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.517
Ari initiated the <i> Catfish TV</i>

10:19.519 --> 10:21.419
discussion and convinced you to

10:21.421 --> 10:22.587
do it.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.723
So she's got what she wants.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.624
Maybe you both need our help,

10:25.626 --> 10:26.625
but we're here to help you

10:26.627 --> 10:27.459
first.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.860
So, yeah, we can do what we do.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.828
>> We're gonna dig.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.829
What is she hiding?

10:30.831 --> 10:31.696
What's the secret?

10:31.698 --> 10:32.697
>> We'll definitely do whatever

10:32.699 --> 10:33.565
we can.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.332
>> Okay.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.166
>> All right, dude, this was

10:35.168 --> 10:36.101
great.

10:36.103 --> 10:36.768
Get back to work.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.869
>> I'll see you guys.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.039
>> Later, Jamey.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.574
He's a tough nut to crack.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.608
He doesn't open up to many

10:43.610 --> 10:45.076
people, you can imagine.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.711
>> Clearly, the situation is

10:46.713 --> 10:47.912
stressing him out.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.080
>> He has opened up a lot to

10:49.082 --> 10:50.949
this girl, so much so that he's

10:50.951 --> 10:54.152
willing to go onto a TV show,

10:54.154 --> 10:55.020
which is probably his worst

10:55.022 --> 10:56.554
nightmare.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.123
What is this secret?

11:03.996 --> 11:07.832
>> ♪ Well, now, I'm retracin' ♪

11:07.834 --> 11:10.168
>> Welcome home, Max.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.037
Here's your notepad.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.738
All right.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.040
Look at the cute girl co-host

11:15.042 --> 11:16.107
handwriting.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.175
>> Can't believe you made this

11:17.177 --> 11:18.576
show with other people.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.611
Other people were sitting next

11:19.613 --> 11:20.979
to you like this?

11:20.981 --> 11:22.580
<i>Catfish</i> cheat.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.381
[romantic music]

11:23.383 --> 11:24.616
>> You wanna bring this up now,

11:24.618 --> 11:25.984
Max, really?

11:25.986 --> 11:29.187
>> It makes me feel replaceable.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.355
>> You did it, Nev!

11:30.357 --> 11:31.890
You got him!

11:31.892 --> 11:33.758
>> You were out cheating on me!

11:33.760 --> 11:35.527
Directing a big Hollywood movie

11:35.529 --> 11:36.861
with all your other friends and

11:36.863 --> 11:38.730
crew and cast.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.965
>> New page, plain...

11:40.967 --> 11:42.233
>> You know what they say...

11:42.235 --> 11:43.601
>> Blank slate.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.469
>> All right, here's what we

11:44.471 --> 11:45.403
got.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.571
We got Jamey.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.107
And he's talking to Arista,

11:49.109 --> 11:50.842
AKA Ari.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.910
We've got a guy who met a girl

11:51.912 --> 11:53.178
on a proper dating website,

11:53.180 --> 11:54.713
quickly started talking, then

11:54.715 --> 11:56.581
immediately, the "Catfish" in

11:56.583 --> 11:58.349
question offered her Skype

11:58.351 --> 11:59.484
handle and...

11:59.486 --> 12:00.452
>> Showed him...

12:00.454 --> 12:01.553
>> Showed her face!

12:01.555 --> 12:02.420
>> Her face.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.288
>> Right. Like we rarely see

12:03.290 --> 12:04.255
that.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.390
What's crazy is that Ari has

12:05.392 --> 12:08.760
said she has some..."secret"

12:08.762 --> 12:10.095
and thinks that coming on this

12:10.097 --> 12:11.896
show is the most appropriate way

12:11.898 --> 12:13.398
to tell Jamey whatever it is she

12:13.400 --> 12:14.866
needs to tell him.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.900
What are the chances it could

12:15.902 --> 12:17.001
work out based on this big

12:17.003 --> 12:19.037
secret she's been hiding?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.171
Okay, we got her cell phone

12:20.173 --> 12:21.072
number.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.006
>> Let's look for her on

12:22.008 --> 12:22.807
Facebook.

12:22.809 --> 12:23.942
>> Here we go.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.877
Here's a picture we've seen.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.278
>> She's from Houston, Texas.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.346
>> Started working at Beauty by

12:28.348 --> 12:30.115
Ari.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.249
And she's got 300 and something

12:31.251 --> 12:32.517
friends.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.185
Most are from Texas.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.186
>> Yeah, well, that's a good

12:35.188 --> 12:36.121
sign.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.655
A lot of them are from Houston.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.457
This is very convincing.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.992
>> Yeah, and that's great.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.960
>> All right, should we reach

12:41.962 --> 12:43.128
out to these friends?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.629
>> I think we should.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.764
>> Sophia's made a bunch of

19:28.935 --> 19:29.834
>> What--yeah.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.668
>> Isn't she telling us the

19:30.670 --> 19:31.569
truth about, or what isn't she

19:31.571 --> 19:32.570
telling us?

19:32.572 --> 19:33.938
Or you?

19:33.940 --> 19:34.906
On one hand, everything checked

19:34.908 --> 19:37.508
out, but the bad news is, on

19:37.510 --> 19:39.944
Ari's Facebook page, here--

19:39.946 --> 19:42.346
on December 24th she wrote,

19:42.348 --> 19:43.948
"Had the best time with my

19:43.950 --> 19:45.449
in-laws!

19:45.451 --> 19:47.618

20:08.708 --> 20:09.707
We reached out to this girl

20:09.709 --> 20:11.342
Sophia, and she called us this

20:11.344 --> 20:12.343
morning.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.945
We asked Sophia if Ari's

20:13.947 --> 20:15.012
married.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.514
She got very--"I don't want to

20:16.516 --> 20:17.648
talk about this anymore."

20:17.650 --> 20:18.382

Maybe that's what it is.

Maybe she's just married.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.927
You know?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.329
Maybe she wants to tell me that

20:31.331 --> 20:32.396
she can't talk to me to be with

20:32.398 --> 20:34.365

a big surprise, but, like,

22:13.099 --> 22:15.766
Jamey's also super-nervous.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.768
But he's come this far.

Ari.

24:41.964 --> 24:42.580

24:42.582 --> 24:44.515
is that she demanded that Jamey

24:44.517 --> 24:46.183
come on the show, 'cause that

24:46.185 --> 24:47.585
was the only way she would meet

24:47.587 --> 24:49.186
him in person.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.354

25:23.856 --> 25:24.855
right now?

25:26.425 --> 25:28.559
flip out, 'cause obviously,

25:28.561 --> 25:29.527
there's something I didn't tell

25:29.529 --> 25:30.561
him.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.663
When I first met Jamey, I wasn't

25:32.665 --> 25:34.565
planning on perusing him.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.866
I just wanted to be friends,

25:35.868 --> 25:36.800
you know, someone I could talk

25:36.802 --> 25:38.068
to.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.005
Guys tend to stray from people

25:41.007 --> 25:42.973
like me, so I thought that by

25:42.975 --> 25:44.341
not telling him, he would just

25:44.343 --> 25:47.111
be a real sincere friend to me.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.746
And I felt like if I didn't tell

25:48.748 --> 25:51.181
him, it would give him a chance

25:51.183 --> 25:52.283
to get to know me.

25:52.285 --> 25:54.952
I...

25:54.954 --> 26:00.624
I'm transgender.

26:00.626 --> 26:01.725
So...

26:01.727 --> 26:02.826
that's kinda what I haven't told

26:02.828 --> 26:04.194
him.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.563
Kinda what I need to tell him.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.664
>> Right.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.965
>> You know, so...

26:07.967 --> 26:09.033
>> We did not know that.

26:09.035 --> 26:09.934
>> No?

26:09.936 --> 26:10.868
>> We thought maybe you were

26:10.870 --> 26:11.802
married.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.637
>> [laughs] No.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.973
>> When you...

26:15.975 --> 26:17.074
are transgender,

26:17.076 --> 26:18.309
I mean, to you what does that

26:18.311 --> 26:19.743
mean?

26:19.745 --> 26:21.946
>> Um, it basically means that

26:21.948 --> 26:23.047
I'm going through a process as

26:23.049 --> 26:26.317
to where I can be a real girl,

26:26.319 --> 26:27.851
full girl.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.453
I have to, like, take hormones

26:29.455 --> 26:30.621
and therapy sessions.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.555
>> Have you been taking

26:31.557 --> 26:32.356
hormones?

26:32.358 --> 26:33.324
>> Yes, I have.

26:33.326 --> 26:34.258
That's kind of what the hormones

26:34.260 --> 26:35.960
are for...to help with the

26:35.962 --> 26:37.227
physical changes.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.562
Um, and then of course the

26:38.564 --> 26:39.930
surgery kinda completes the

26:39.932 --> 26:40.998
whole thing.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.232
>> And it's expensive.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.034
>> It is expensive, but I mean,

26:44.036 --> 26:46.370
there's no price for happiness.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.105
>> Well, that's exciting.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.039
And you have no doubt about

26:49.041 --> 26:49.940
that.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.075
>> Oh, yeah, I'm going through

26:51.077 --> 26:53.677
it, yeah, 100 and 50,000%.

26:53.679 --> 26:54.778
[laughter]

26:54.780 --> 26:55.779
I've known since I was very

26:55.781 --> 26:56.680
little.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.648
My parents have known since I

26:57.650 --> 26:58.549
was very little.

26:58.551 --> 27:00.050
I believe I was about five, and

27:00.052 --> 27:01.452
we were at Walmart in the

27:01.454 --> 27:02.720
Barbie aisle.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.321
My mom grabbed a Barbie, and

27:04.323 --> 27:06.657
then she grabbed a wrestler and

27:06.659 --> 27:08.025
she asked me which one I wanted,

27:08.027 --> 27:09.827
and I picked the Barbie.

27:09.829 --> 27:10.995
So she said from that moment she

27:10.997 --> 27:12.863
knew that I was a little

27:12.865 --> 27:15.065
different than others, so they

27:15.067 --> 27:16.166
just became very accepting of

27:16.168 --> 27:17.134
me.

27:18.037 --> 27:18.702

27:24.443 --> 27:25.809
>> both: The in-laws.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.877
>> Yeah, I've known them for

27:26.879 --> 27:28.045
years, that's why.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.446
I was hanging out with an

27:29.448 --> 27:30.914
ex-boyfriend.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.783
It was nothing too serious.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.084
I told Jamey about it.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.319
Jamey knows.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.754
>> So you are single.

27:36.756 --> 27:37.855
>> Yeah, of course.

27:37.857 --> 27:38.956
>> Okay.

27:38.958 --> 27:39.990
>> And your previous

27:39.992 --> 27:41.225
relationship with Caz--was he a

27:41.227 --> 27:43.027
guy who had previously not been

27:43.029 --> 27:44.128
interested or considered dating

27:44.130 --> 27:45.562
a transgender or--

27:45.564 --> 27:47.431
>> No, when I met Caz, I told

27:47.433 --> 27:48.666
him right off the bat.

27:48.668 --> 27:49.700
He was fine with it.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.268
He was okay with it, and he

27:51.270 --> 27:52.970
still wanted to keep talking, so

27:52.972 --> 27:55.105
we did, and we became really

27:55.107 --> 27:56.240
good friends.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.308
>> But also...lovers.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.376
>> Lovers, yes.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.678

28:00.680 --> 28:01.779
other or no?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.180
>> Um...no, no.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.148
>> Okay. 'Cause you said you're

28:04.150 --> 28:04.848
a virgin.

28:04.850 --> 28:05.783
>> Yeah.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.583
>> We weren't sure.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.185

with my body to feel the need

28:10.623 --> 28:13.557
or--or want to...

28:13.559 --> 28:15.659
be that intimate with someone.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.727
>> So the whole time that you've

28:16.729 --> 28:18.462
been talking to Jamey, this has

28:18.464 --> 28:19.930
never come up?

28:19.932 --> 28:20.864
>> Um...

28:20.866 --> 28:22.066
>> You've never come close to

28:22.068 --> 28:23.801
mentioning this to him?

28:23.803 --> 28:26.203
>> Um...no.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.971
Like I said, it was never my

28:27.973 --> 28:29.707
intention to have feelings for

28:29.709 --> 28:32.042
one another and not tell him,

28:32.044 --> 28:33.777
but it kinda just happened.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.145
And so before you know it, we

28:35.147 --> 28:36.814
were just really close, and I

28:36.816 --> 28:40.084
kinda got stuck in a hard place.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.652
I just came to a point where

28:41.654 --> 28:43.454
I felt the need that he had to

28:43.456 --> 28:45.022
know, and I couldn't do it by

28:45.024 --> 28:46.757
myself.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.758

28:55.668 --> 28:57.568

29:03.876 --> 29:05.275

29:06.245 --> 29:07.478
to either.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.445
>> I guess the next order of

29:08.447 --> 29:11.081
business would be for us to meet

29:11.083 --> 29:12.583
with Jamey so he can make the

29:12.585 --> 29:14.551
decision that's best for him.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.231
is how could you not have told

29:27.233 --> 29:28.632
me after, like, all this time.
