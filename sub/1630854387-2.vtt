13:27.431 --> 13:29.266
All right, let's go.
We've gotta be quick.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.567
They cleaned
the crime scene.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.571
Whatever happened here,
they wanna hide it.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.073
They can't hide it from me.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.415
Yeah, Conner was right.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.001
Someone used magic.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.671
How do you know?

13:58.754 --> 14:00.381
Because all magic
leaves a trace.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.517
In the physical world,
things pass.

14:13.477 --> 14:17.106
But beyond the veil,
things remain...

14:18.190 --> 14:19.400
like echoes.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.737
So, I should be
able to get a sense
of whoever did this.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.414
I don't know who did it,
but I've seen
where they've been.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.583
Come on.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.136

15:31.263 --> 15:33.891

Did you see anything?

15:40.981 --> 15:41.899
No...

15:43.984 --> 15:46.779
You ran off,
and then I found you here.

[Gar breathing shakily]

15:51.659 --> 15:53.035

16:16.266 --> 16:17.142

16:26.193 --> 16:27.569
[Sebastian] Mom,
what're you doing?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.364
Come on. You're supposed
to stay off that leg

16:30.447 --> 16:33.992
-a couple more weeks they told.
-Okay. Sebastian. Okay!

16:34.076 --> 16:36.787
-[sighing] Oh.
-Okay.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.747
[exhales deeply]

16:38.831 --> 16:42.167
Oh. So, how is Julie?

16:42.251 --> 16:45.337
You never bring her by.
I like her.

16:45.421 --> 16:48.048
-Mom--
-She's good for you.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.387
Julie's busy, Mom.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.640
She sends her love though.

16:56.724 --> 17:01.729
Well, a good man deserves
a good woman by his side.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.439
-Yeah?
-[TV playing]

17:03.522 --> 17:05.190

17:16.827 --> 17:21.457

-man 1: I see it.
-man 2: Oh, there she is, yeah.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.421
I didn't tell you, Mom.
I've got a big meeting
coming up.

17:27.504 --> 17:30.048
-Oh?
-About my
interactive experience.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.510
I'm close
to finding the funding.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.890
I think they really understand
what I'm trying to do.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.977
Anyway, if it works out--

17:42.060 --> 17:47.608
There's nothing my Sabby
can't do when he puts
his mind to it. Hm?

17:47.691 --> 17:50.277
-[laughs]
-[chuckles] Mom...

17:50.360 --> 17:53.280
Oh. Already seen this one.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.784
Yeah, but it's a good one.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.452
[man on TV] ...you got
my number, Miss Miller.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.536
Thanks, Mom.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.504
-This is what I saw.
-In your vision?

That address, this house.

Stay close. We don't know
what we're gonna find.

she had visions.

[Kory] Yeah.

I preferred a world
where Lex Luthor
and I weren't a thing.

about knowing
he was watching me.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.582
If you wanted
a window into his mind,

25:42.666 --> 25:44.334
I could give you one.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.543
He mentioned me?

25:45.627 --> 25:48.421
No, but part of me knows
how he thinks.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.422
He is my father.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.549
Lay it on me.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.553
Lex was dying.

25:57.055 --> 26:01.101

with their time.

26:01.184 --> 26:04.437
Sounds like he invested
a lot of time into you, Kory.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.065
Lex Luthor would never
invest anything

26:07.148 --> 26:08.692
without expecting a return.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.821
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.615
I didn't want it to.
Whatever this is...

26:15.699 --> 26:20.036
whatever he was doing,
he believed that you
were connected to it.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.580
If I were you,
I'd spend a lot of time
thinking about how.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.710
You can take
the Luthor hat off now.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.088
You're not him.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.424
You have two fathers.
Never forget that.

made in his image.

that people here say about me.

a fucking thing.

They'll have to drag me
out of here, and we both know
what'll happen.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.384
No, it's okay.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.263
Better play by the rules.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.182
See where that gets you.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.736
Kory.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.782
Maybe you didn't find
Lex's secret.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.327
Maybe you found him
searching for yours.

27:57.342 --> 28:02.639
[Sebastian] I think
you'll find the retention rate
will exceed expectation.

28:02.722 --> 28:08.228
And as the game continues,
it gets progressively
more difficult.

28:08.311 --> 28:12.065

but on a infinitely
larger scale.

of course.

is a brutal place.

It's... [chuckles]

28:40.927 --> 28:42.345
It's cruel. Yeah.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.767
People all...
all smashed up...

28:47.851 --> 28:51.104
against each other,
millions of miles apart.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.733
We don't share anything.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.282

you're just moving shapes
around the screen.

I think I speak
for my colleagues when I say,

29:12.750 --> 29:14.711
I'm not certain
where this is competitive.

29:14.794 --> 29:19.007
Well, it's not. I mean
not directly competitive.

29:19.090 --> 29:19.966
[sighs]

29:20.800 --> 29:21.843
The goal is...

29:24.095 --> 29:28.224
The goal is not
to foster competition
amongst gamers,

29:29.559 --> 29:31.102
it's to build community.

29:37.025 --> 29:41.237
Mr. Sanger,
your presentation
was well told.

29:43.406 --> 29:48.578
-And we love how passionate
you are about your idea.
-Yeah. Mm-hm.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.622
But I'm going to change
the world.

Nobody will tell me
what happened to her.

But I saw her.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.115
I know what happened.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.672
I lost both my parents
when I was about your age.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.049
What I remember
is how cold everything felt.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.844
No matter what I did
to get warm...

37:45.596 --> 37:46.472
I couldn't.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.103
And then a very strong man
wrapped his jacket around me.

37:53.980 --> 37:54.939
This jacket.

37:58.192 --> 38:01.570
He told me... that time
would make things better.

No, Aria, nothing like him.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.980
You see there's good magic
and bad magic.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.573

38:55.041 --> 38:56.042

from any responsibility

39:16.145 --> 39:18.773
in the death
of Alexander Luthor Jr.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.401
While Mr. Kent was in custody
for a crime he did not commit,

39:22.485 --> 39:24.945

39:25.029 --> 39:27.865

around Luthor's death.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.785
A death that was
an apparent homicide

39:30.868 --> 39:33.412

official definition.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.247
[Dick] We know
who killed Lex Luthor.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.626
Everyone knows
you're innocent now.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.757
Arthur Homewood, Lex Luthor's
personal physician.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.509
He promised him a lot more
than just a cure.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.886
He trusted a madman.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.098
Whatever power
Luthor was buying,

39:52.181 --> 39:55.226

wanted to keep it for himself.
