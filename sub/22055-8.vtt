CONTESTANT: Awesome!

04:45.802 --> 04:48.046

I want him to swing
by in a loincloth.

04:51.739 --> 04:52.568

06:54.344 --> 06:55.587

06:57.278 --> 06:58.590
at some ingredients.
Blackberries.

06:58.694 --> 07:00.489

07:22.752 --> 07:25.410
Oh my god.

07:25.514 --> 07:26.791
[grunting]

07:26.894 --> 07:28.689
For fuck's sake.

07:28.793 --> 07:29.587
DANA: Sorry, chef.

07:29.690 --> 07:30.519
CONTESTANT: What is that?

07:30.622 --> 07:31.451
It's yams.

07:31.554 --> 07:32.348
Tomatoes and spinach.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.764
Just over 60 seconds to go.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.490
NARRATOR: With the
second spears completed,

07:36.594 --> 07:37.526

CONTESTANT: What is that, bro?- [inaudible]

07:43.152 --> 07:44.325
CONTESTANT: Hurry it up.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.258
NICK: Where are the nuts?

07:46.362 --> 07:47.846
Walnuts, they're--

07:47.950 --> 07:48.778
Sorry.

07:48.882 --> 07:49.917
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

07:50.021 --> 07:50.815

07:50.918 --> 07:51.919
Let's go!

07:52.023 --> 07:53.300
CONTESTANT: You need
color on the plate!

07:53.403 --> 07:54.197
No, don't take bok choy.

07:54.301 --> 07:55.405
Leave that there.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.752
DANA: No, Barbie, wealready have Swiss chard!

07:56.855 --> 07:58.823
Barb, why would
you grab bok choy?

07:58.926 --> 08:03.344
GORDON RAMSAY: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

08:03.448 --> 08:04.311
That is it.

08:04.414 --> 08:05.450
CONTESTANT: Good job, Van.

08:05.554 --> 08:06.831
Wow.

08:06.934 --> 08:11.042
You all have 45 minutes tocompose a stunning dish,

08:11.145 --> 08:14.977
giving these exotic meatsa very modern flair.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.807
45 minutes start-- now.

08:17.911 --> 08:18.808
Let's go.
CONTESTANT: Go.

08:18.912 --> 08:20.154
Go, go, go, go, go.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.190
All right, everybody meetwith your partner and make sure

08:21.293 --> 08:22.329
you're not duplicating the dish.

08:22.432 --> 08:23.433
Right here, Van.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.090
NARRATOR: The teams
must now create dishes--

08:25.194 --> 08:26.367
Where are the bowls?

08:26.471 --> 08:28.197
NARRATOR: --featuring theirgame meat and all five

08:28.300 --> 08:29.370
speared ingredients.

08:29.474 --> 08:30.717
Yeah, I'll clean off
this silver skin, OK?

08:30.820 --> 08:31.718
OK.

08:31.821 --> 08:32.857
NARRATOR: Two chefs
from each team

08:32.960 --> 08:34.893
will cook the sameprotein, except for Nick--

08:34.997 --> 08:35.998
You guys got this.

08:36.101 --> 08:37.309
NARRATOR: --who is the
only person cooking

08:37.413 --> 08:38.621
venison for the blue team.

08:38.725 --> 08:39.519
Manda.

08:39.622 --> 08:40.450
Yes, chef.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.728
You ever cook
with this before?

08:41.831 --> 08:43.143
No.
I'm from New Jersey.

08:43.246 --> 08:44.627
I don't get this stuff.

08:44.731 --> 08:45.525
Boar?

08:45.628 --> 08:47.078
Who the hell eats boar?

08:47.181 --> 08:49.736
Like, don't they havelike rabies or something?

08:49.839 --> 08:51.807
Going in the convection
with the boar!

08:51.910 --> 08:52.739
Five minutes in, guys.

08:52.842 --> 08:53.809
Five minutes in.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.155
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

08:55.258 --> 08:56.328
Elk cook really quick?

08:56.432 --> 08:57.709
Yeah, it's very lean.

08:57.813 --> 08:58.607
Gotcha.

08:58.710 --> 08:59.918
I never cooked elk before.

09:00.022 --> 09:02.818
So what I'm doing now is Iam watching Ben like a hawk.

09:02.921 --> 09:05.234
He's always kicking
my ass in challenges.

09:05.337 --> 09:09.790
So when Ben puts his elk down,I'll put my elk in a saute pan.

09:09.894 --> 09:13.898
When he rotates
it, I'll rotate it.

09:14.001 --> 09:16.141
Because of Benjamin, I'mtotally confident that I'm

09:16.245 --> 09:19.351
going to nail this elk dish.

09:19.455 --> 09:20.870
GORDON RAMSAY: 23
minutes remaining.

09:20.974 --> 09:22.182
We are halfway.

09:22.285 --> 09:23.632
- You settled down today?- Yes, chef.

09:23.735 --> 09:24.529
I'm sorry, chef.

09:24.633 --> 09:25.530
What are you doing?

09:25.634 --> 09:27.567
Seared venison,
sauteed braised kale.

09:27.670 --> 09:30.811
Michelle, this dish today istotally a statement piece.

09:30.915 --> 09:32.502
Like who is the weakest link?

09:32.606 --> 09:35.644
I don't think so.

09:35.747 --> 09:37.231
Five minutes remaining.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.854
Five minutes, chef.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.683
Come on.

09:40.787 --> 09:42.685
You fucking assholes,this thing's way too hot.

09:42.789 --> 09:44.549
Why is the oven up
like that, you guys?

09:44.653 --> 09:48.173
The oven is turned up to475, which I think is insane.

09:48.277 --> 09:49.347
Sabotage.

09:49.450 --> 09:50.762
GORDON RAMSAY: We are
down to two minutes--

09:50.866 --> 09:51.660
red team, blue team.

09:51.763 --> 09:52.695
Right behind.

09:52.799 --> 09:53.938
GORDON RAMSAY:
Finishing touches.

09:54.041 --> 09:54.870
Got to plate!

09:54.973 --> 09:55.974
Come on!

09:56.078 --> 09:58.494
MICHELLE: This is
still fucking raw.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.978
Get me a hot pan, please!

10:00.082 --> 10:02.015
Hot pan is here!

10:02.118 --> 10:04.086
Oh Lord.

10:04.189 --> 10:05.674
I don't know what kind
of noise a boar makes,

10:05.777 --> 10:07.641
but it certainly was
talking in that pan, OK?

10:07.745 --> 10:09.367
Come on!

10:09.470 --> 10:10.644
[grunting]

10:10.748 --> 10:12.025
CONTESTANT: Come on, Manda!You can do it.

10:12.128 --> 10:13.578
Shit.
I'm sorry, guys.

10:13.682 --> 10:15.373
30 seconds remaining.

10:15.476 --> 10:16.339
Robyn, please.

10:16.443 --> 10:17.893
Why are you so behind, Robyn?

10:17.996 --> 10:19.032
I'm plating right now, chef.

10:19.135 --> 10:19.895
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

10:19.998 --> 10:21.241
10, 9--

10:21.344 --> 10:22.587
- Where's your plate?
- It's right here!

10:22.691 --> 10:23.726
It's right here!

10:23.830 --> 10:33.943
GORDON RAMSAY: 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1, and stop.

10:34.047 --> 10:35.289
Everybody happy?

10:35.393 --> 10:36.187
[IN UNISON] Yes, chef.

10:36.290 --> 10:37.567
Good.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.709
Now, I cannot think of twopeople more qualified to help

10:40.812 --> 10:42.020
me judge this challenge.

10:42.124 --> 10:45.506
John Shook and Vinny
Dotolo please, welcome.

10:45.610 --> 10:46.404
All right, chef.

10:46.507 --> 10:47.647
Welcome back.

10:47.750 --> 10:48.544
Thanks for having us.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.476
Good to see you.

10:49.579 --> 10:51.133
Chef John and
Vinny from Animal

10:51.236 --> 10:53.480
were actually
judges on season 14.

10:53.583 --> 10:54.826
GORDON RAMSAY: Describe
the dish, please.

10:54.930 --> 10:57.553
MICHELLE: It's an Asianinspired alligator curry.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.037
That was the best
dish of the day.

10:59.141 --> 11:00.004
CONTESTANT: Wow.

11:00.107 --> 11:00.418
CONTESTANT 2: Good
job, Michelle.

11:00.521 --> 11:01.522
Wow.

11:01.626 --> 11:02.178
GORDON RAMSAY: They've
gone on and opened

11:02.282 --> 11:03.007
two more restaurants--

11:03.110 --> 11:03.835
Son of a Gun and Trois Mec.

11:03.939 --> 11:04.974
Right.

11:05.078 --> 11:06.804
So let's start off with
the battle of the boar.

11:06.907 --> 11:07.701
Let's go.

11:07.805 --> 11:08.944
Come on, guys.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.498
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay, JohnShook, and Vinny Dotolo

11:11.601 --> 11:14.052
will judge all the
dishes of each protein

11:14.156 --> 11:16.606
and then will pick a
winner for each round.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.885
So I have a walnut-crustedwild boar loin,

11:18.988 --> 11:20.438
some southern style
braised collard

11:20.541 --> 11:22.612
greens with Brussels and bacon.

11:22.716 --> 11:23.821
How did that taste?

11:23.924 --> 11:25.650
I actually really
love the crust.

11:25.754 --> 11:28.653
The meat and the collardgreens go beautifully together.

11:28.757 --> 11:30.068
I think the dish
plays really strong.

11:30.172 --> 11:30.966
Seasoning is nice.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.001
Thank you.

11:32.105 --> 11:33.762
My southern charm
is bringing it home!

11:33.865 --> 11:36.765
Chefs can taste thatsouth in his mouth, baby!

11:36.868 --> 11:39.284
NARRATOR: It's now the momentof truth for Manda's boar

11:39.388 --> 11:40.596
chop with apple and fennel.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.322
Could you tell us how youcooked the piece of meat,

11:42.425 --> 11:43.288
please?

11:43.392 --> 11:44.186
MANDA: I seared
it and basted it,

11:44.289 --> 11:45.325
and then put it in the oven.

11:45.428 --> 11:47.292
And then, last
minute I sliced it,

11:47.396 --> 11:48.742
and I just gave it a quick sear.

11:48.846 --> 11:51.641
You put it back in the
pan after you cut it?

11:51.745 --> 11:52.712
Yes, I did.

11:52.815 --> 11:54.817
It really hurts
the overall dish.

11:54.921 --> 11:56.232
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh dear.

11:56.336 --> 11:57.993
NARRATOR: Next up
is Milly's rosemary

11:58.096 --> 12:00.374
marinated boar loin
with deep fried Brussels

12:00.478 --> 12:02.411
sprouts and bacon jam.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.655
This one just feels likeit's a little bit undercooked.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.243
To me the Brusselssprouts are a little greasy.

12:07.347 --> 12:08.210
Yeah.
Doesn't work.

12:08.313 --> 12:09.142
JUDGE: Yeah.

12:09.245 --> 12:10.143
Just doesn't work

12:10.246 --> 12:11.040
Right.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.421
Jennifer.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.078
NARRATOR: With Van seeminglystill in the driver's seat,

12:14.181 --> 12:17.633
Jennifer is the red team'slast hope to win this round

12:17.737 --> 12:19.290
with her home style boar dish.

12:19.393 --> 12:22.431
Chefs, I was trying to thinkpork chops and apple sauce.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.570
I like the thought
process on it.

12:23.673 --> 12:24.709
I do, too.

12:24.813 --> 12:25.917
I think the herbs are
very nice for the dish.

12:26.021 --> 12:28.575
The apples played nicely
with the boar chop.

12:28.678 --> 12:30.542
Jennifer, love whatyou've done with the apples.

12:30.646 --> 12:31.440
Spot on.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.372
Thank you, chef.

12:32.475 --> 12:33.545
Gents.

12:33.649 --> 12:36.617
So the winner of the
boar dish belongs

12:36.721 --> 12:38.827
to blue team or the red team?

12:38.930 --> 12:40.138
For me, I would pick Van.

12:40.242 --> 12:41.691
Blue.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.589
Oh, yeah!

12:42.692 --> 12:45.212
I pulled out the W, baby!

12:45.316 --> 12:47.525
Blue team, out
the gate strong.

12:47.628 --> 12:49.630
Next up, venison, please.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.701
NARRATOR: With the men
taking the first round,

12:51.805 --> 12:54.635
the spotlight shifts toNick, who has the blue team's

12:54.739 --> 12:55.982
only venison dish.

12:56.085 --> 12:58.536
What you have is a warm
spice roasted venison

12:58.639 --> 13:01.159
with a butternut squash puree.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.574
John, does it tastes
as good as it looks?

13:05.198 --> 13:06.337
It actually does.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.269
Nice dish.

13:07.372 --> 13:08.477
It tastes exceptional.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.306
Thank you, chef.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.204
NARRATOR: Next--

13:11.307 --> 13:12.481
Dana

13:12.584 --> 13:13.965
NARRATOR: --will try to topNick's dish with a roast

13:14.069 --> 13:16.588
venison, yam, and pear puree.

13:16.692 --> 13:17.693
Vinny, how was that for you?

13:17.797 --> 13:18.798
I felt like the
meat could have

13:18.901 --> 13:19.764
used a little more seasoning.

13:19.868 --> 13:20.800
Yeah.

13:20.903 --> 13:22.698
Next time I would
just put less meat.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.527
Venison that thick,
you know, doesn't

13:24.631 --> 13:26.391
deliver its best texture.

13:26.495 --> 13:28.566
NARRATOR: After Dana's
disappointing showing,

13:28.669 --> 13:30.913
it's up to Elise and
her venison with yam

13:31.017 --> 13:33.122
puree to keep the
red team alive.

13:33.226 --> 13:34.848
ELISE: This is no
ordinary challenge.

13:34.952 --> 13:36.539
I'm not paying attentionto how the blue team doing.

13:36.643 --> 13:37.886
It's like, Michelle came for me.

13:37.989 --> 13:40.716
So now it's my mission tooutdo her every single time.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.787
I love the confidence
in not slicing the meat.

13:42.891 --> 13:43.857
Thank you.

13:43.961 --> 13:45.583
So hopefully you
know your temperatures,

13:45.686 --> 13:48.724
and when I cut in there
it's nice and perfect.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.174
[dramatic music]

13:57.698 --> 13:59.045
NARRATOR: It's
round two of judging

13:59.148 --> 14:00.909
in today's game meat challenge.

14:01.012 --> 14:03.118
I love the confidence
in not slicing the meat.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.326
Thank you.

14:04.429 --> 14:06.121
NARRATOR: And with the menwinning the first round,

14:06.224 --> 14:08.226
it's come down to
Elise's venison dish

14:08.330 --> 14:10.228
to prevent a blue team win--

14:10.332 --> 14:11.609
at least, for now.

14:11.712 --> 14:13.093
So hopefully you
know your temperatures,

14:13.197 --> 14:15.095
and when I cut in there
it's nice and perfect.

14:22.033 --> 14:22.965
It's cooked--

14:23.069 --> 14:24.242
Perfect.
- Yeah.

14:24.346 --> 14:25.174
Thank you.

14:25.278 --> 14:26.555
With this dish,
it really feels

14:26.658 --> 14:28.764
like you let the star of theshow be the star of the show.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.730
Thank you.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.146
Hands down the
best dish by Elise.

14:31.249 --> 14:32.872
I think Elise actually
has had the best dish.

14:32.975 --> 14:34.390
GORDON RAMSAY: Elise--
- Oh.

14:34.494 --> 14:35.426
GORDON RAMSAY: Great job.

14:35.529 --> 14:37.221
Fuck my life.

14:37.324 --> 14:38.705
Michelle, I told
you yesterday,

14:38.808 --> 14:40.534
Boo Boo, that
moving forward, I'm

14:40.638 --> 14:42.640
going to be at infinity speed.

14:42.743 --> 14:43.952
You better keep up.

14:44.055 --> 14:45.367
This is it.

14:45.470 --> 14:48.335
We're tied at 1-1, and it's alldown to the battle of the elk,

14:48.439 --> 14:49.233
please.

14:49.336 --> 14:50.959
Let's go.

14:51.062 --> 14:52.374
Wow.

14:52.477 --> 14:55.480
So it's basically coming downto my dish and Benjamin's dish

14:55.584 --> 14:56.516
for our team.

14:56.619 --> 14:57.931
My fingers are crossed.

14:58.035 --> 15:01.762
Hope that my plan to followBenjamin was a bright decision.

15:01.866 --> 15:03.281
Barbie, please
describe your dish.

15:03.385 --> 15:07.699
I have pan roasted elkwith chili braised bok choy.

15:07.803 --> 15:08.908
Interesting.

15:09.011 --> 15:10.495
The cook is actuallynice on the piece of meat.

15:10.599 --> 15:12.014
That's tender.
Delicious.

15:12.118 --> 15:13.119
And it's seasoned beautifully.

15:13.222 --> 15:14.223
Solid effort

15:14.327 --> 15:15.638
Thank you, chefs.

15:15.742 --> 15:18.469
NARRATOR: Up next is Benjamin,with his juniper marinated elk

15:18.572 --> 15:20.057
loin.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.473
I think it's a little
bit under-seasoned.

15:22.576 --> 15:23.577
I think it's kind of flat.

15:23.681 --> 15:24.958
It needs a little bit of spice.

15:25.062 --> 15:25.855
Yes, chef.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.202
Wow.

15:27.305 --> 15:29.411
Ben is usually one of thestrong ones in this competition,

15:29.514 --> 15:31.240
so for him not to
do good, it's like--

15:31.344 --> 15:32.966
we might win this round.

15:33.070 --> 15:34.278
NARRATOR: Next up is Michelle--

15:34.381 --> 15:35.589
Enjoy.

15:35.693 --> 15:39.869
NARRATOR: --with her panseared elk with chickpea puree.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.457
I think the meat
was a little bit dry.

15:41.561 --> 15:42.942
GORDON RAMSAY:
That's a great shame.

15:43.045 --> 15:45.289
Michelle's meat
is dry like jerky.

15:45.392 --> 15:47.739
On the inside I'm laughing,because she be walking around

15:47.843 --> 15:49.086
with her nose up in
the air talking about

15:49.189 --> 15:51.295
she better than everybody.

15:51.398 --> 15:53.297
NARRATOR: The final
dish is Robyn's elk

15:53.400 --> 15:54.919
with chimichurri sauce.

15:55.023 --> 15:56.576
- Vinny, how's this?
- It's simple.

15:56.679 --> 15:57.611
It's nice.

15:57.715 --> 15:59.130
It had some nice acidity to it.

15:59.234 --> 16:00.028
Thank you, chef.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.167
- I love chimichurri.
- Yeah.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.133
Give it a bit of a wow.

16:02.237 --> 16:04.101
Chimichurri, great
idea by the way.

16:04.204 --> 16:05.999
Good job.

16:06.103 --> 16:07.414
Gents, tough one, this one.

16:07.518 --> 16:09.244
Which one would you eliminate?

16:09.347 --> 16:10.176
Michelle.

16:10.279 --> 16:11.660
You'd go for Michelle.
Vinny?

16:11.763 --> 16:12.557
Benjamin

16:12.661 --> 16:13.973
Benjamin.

16:14.076 --> 16:17.286
So we come down to the toptwo, which is Barbie and Robyn.

16:17.390 --> 16:18.494
Come on, Barbie!

16:18.598 --> 16:20.324
Never thought I'd
be saying that.

16:20.427 --> 16:21.601
Gents.

16:21.704 --> 16:25.985
Top dish is between
Barbie or Robyn.

16:26.088 --> 16:29.229
The winner of this
challenge, I think--

16:29.333 --> 16:30.679
I think Robyn.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.370
I think I would haveto go with Robyn as well.

16:32.474 --> 16:33.268
All right.

16:33.371 --> 16:34.269
Blue team, congratulations.

16:34.372 --> 16:35.546
Thank you, chefs.

16:35.649 --> 16:39.205
[cheering] Out of fourdishes, my dish was the best.

16:39.308 --> 16:41.172
GORDON RAMSAY: Robyn, well done.
CONTESTANT: Yes, Robyn.

16:41.276 --> 16:42.346
CONTESTANT 2:
That's right, girl.

16:42.449 --> 16:43.209
- Thank you, chefs.- Good to see you. buddy.

16:43.312 --> 16:44.589
Take care.
- Thank you guys.

16:44.693 --> 16:45.935
Thanks for having us.GORDON RAMSAY: You take care.

16:46.039 --> 16:46.867
Thanks, John.

16:46.971 --> 16:47.868
Good job, Robyn.

16:47.972 --> 16:48.973
Right.

16:49.077 --> 16:50.526
Blue team, you're in
for an amazing reward.

16:50.630 --> 16:55.359
You'll all be heading out toan exclusive mountain retreat,

16:55.462 --> 16:56.636
Hummingbird Nest Ranch.

16:56.739 --> 16:57.844
- Wow.
- All right.

16:57.947 --> 16:58.741
Awesome.

16:58.845 --> 17:00.916
It is beautiful.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.953
Whilst there, you'll enjoythousands of dollars of caviar,

17:04.057 --> 17:05.645
provided by Petrossian.

17:05.748 --> 17:06.749
It's a luxury caviar.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.268
You're going to love it.
- Balling.

17:08.372 --> 17:09.856
- Head to the door.
- Thank you, chef.

17:09.959 --> 17:10.753
Your cars are waiting.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.203
Robyn, welcome back.

17:12.307 --> 17:13.101
Thank you, chef.

17:13.204 --> 17:14.792
Holy crap!

17:14.895 --> 17:17.312
[cheering] Yes!

17:17.415 --> 17:18.209
Good job, honey.

17:18.313 --> 17:19.486
I'm so proud of you.

17:19.590 --> 17:20.418
Now, red team.

17:20.522 --> 17:22.972
Today is spring cleaning day.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.561
I'm talking about scrubbingfloors and scouring the toilet.

17:25.665 --> 17:27.908
Now, after the bathrooms aredone, jump into the shower

17:28.012 --> 17:28.806
stalls.

17:28.909 --> 17:30.256
Ew.

17:30.359 --> 17:33.190
Once those dorms are back topristine, immaculate condition,

17:33.293 --> 17:35.709
all our waiting staff's aprons--

17:35.813 --> 17:37.125
they need some ironing.
Happy?

17:37.228 --> 17:38.333
- No, chef.
- Great.

17:38.436 --> 17:39.230
Off you go.

17:39.334 --> 17:40.404
Yes, chef.

17:40.507 --> 17:41.784
I was hoping Chef
Ramsay was going

17:41.888 --> 17:43.959
to say since I had the bestdish that I could go ahead

17:44.063 --> 17:45.236
and join the blue team, but no.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.963
I'm stuck here scrubbingpubes out of the showers.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.860
Great.

17:48.964 --> 17:49.758
Literally, everyone--

17:49.861 --> 17:50.828
We did a good job.

17:50.931 --> 17:51.725
--did a good job.

17:51.829 --> 17:53.486
We didn't do a good job.

17:53.589 --> 17:56.454
Nobody got points,
except my one.

17:56.558 --> 18:00.286
Michelle's like, I think we allshould be proud of ourselves.

18:00.389 --> 18:01.873
Proud of what?
Your non-point?

18:01.977 --> 18:02.771
Your dry meat?

18:02.874 --> 18:03.979
Bye.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.394
You guys can start
in the kitchen.

18:05.498 --> 18:06.326
Yes, chef.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.707
Oh. yes, queen.

18:07.810 --> 18:08.604
There you go.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.330
Oh, you're dapper, bro.

18:10.434 --> 18:11.952
Man, we won!

18:12.056 --> 18:15.542
It feels so good to win, and weare dressed to impress, baby.

18:15.646 --> 18:16.474
Look at us.

18:16.578 --> 18:17.303
There we go, guys.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.034
Ew.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.035
Ain't that nasty?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.245
The dorms are pretty gnarly.

18:28.348 --> 18:30.695
If you've ever lived
with boys, you know

18:30.799 --> 18:32.525
that it's not always pretty.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.113
Oh my god.

18:34.216 --> 18:35.493
That it's gross.

18:35.597 --> 18:36.425
Ugh.

18:36.529 --> 18:37.633
This is fucking sweaty.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.256
What the fuck is this?

18:39.359 --> 18:42.811
On Milly's chair, he had
two hamburgers in a bag.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.503
And I don't know if he wassaving it for later or what.

18:45.607 --> 18:49.645
But I am like completely
freaked out right now.

18:49.749 --> 18:50.577
Ugh.

18:50.681 --> 18:52.407
You got it, Elise?

18:52.510 --> 18:53.856
Yeah?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.479
It would be nice to have somespace during this punishment,

18:55.582 --> 18:56.583
because I'm not like Michelle.

18:56.687 --> 18:58.447
I can't just walk around
and be fake people

18:58.551 --> 19:01.312
and then wait for my opportunityto stab them in the back.

19:01.416 --> 19:02.693
This iron sucks.

19:02.796 --> 19:03.728
Yeah, this one does, too.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.568
[cheering]
CONTESTANT: Wow.

19:15.671 --> 19:16.638
Oh my god.
VIP

19:16.741 --> 19:17.535
Wow.

19:17.639 --> 19:18.605
God damn.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.297
Hummingbird Nest
Ranch is beautiful.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.989
It's pretty bougie, andit seems really expensive.

19:23.092 --> 19:25.440
I am so far from
fancy, refined--

19:25.543 --> 19:26.613
This is so nice.

19:26.717 --> 19:27.545
Oh god.

19:27.649 --> 19:29.064
I'm so far from that.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.341
Hey, guys.
How are you?

19:30.445 --> 19:31.239
Hello, chef.

19:31.342 --> 19:32.274
Congratulations on your win.

19:32.378 --> 19:33.413
Thank you.

19:33.517 --> 19:35.312
This is a perfect day
to taste some caviar.

19:35.415 --> 19:36.416
CONTESTANT: Awesome.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.659
So the first caviar
we're going to taste,

19:37.762 --> 19:39.902
it's from California.

19:40.006 --> 19:42.664
Yes, it tastes like
the fresh ocean.

19:42.767 --> 19:43.734
Oh, man.

19:43.837 --> 19:46.806
This caviar that I'm
tasting is creamy.

19:46.909 --> 19:48.187
It's so rich.

19:48.290 --> 19:50.534
You just eat it, and you justbecome part of the caviar.

19:50.637 --> 19:51.466
That's great.

19:51.569 --> 19:52.950
CHEF: Is that your
favorite so far?

19:53.053 --> 19:54.400
Yeah.
That was beautiful.

19:54.503 --> 19:56.264
Milly is loving this caviar.

19:56.367 --> 19:59.784
CHEF: You should getcreamy again on this one.

19:59.888 --> 20:01.269
He's making love
to the caviar.

20:01.372 --> 20:02.166
Mm-mm-mm.

20:05.618 --> 20:08.103
CHEF: Next, I'm going tomake some lunch for you guys.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.139
I just worked for a chef, andmy responsibility was to taste

20:10.243 --> 20:11.279
the caviar every morning.

20:11.382 --> 20:13.315
So I know that this
is the best caviar

20:13.419 --> 20:15.490
you can try in your life.

20:15.593 --> 20:16.387
So the first course--

20:16.491 --> 20:17.457
caviar, foie gras, uni--

20:17.561 --> 20:19.148
CONTESTANT: Damn.
- --and tuna.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.011
CONTESTANT: Whoa.

20:20.115 --> 20:21.703
Cheers on that-- blue team.

20:21.806 --> 20:22.980
Cheers.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.292
NARRATOR: While
the blue team bonds

20:24.395 --> 20:28.296
together outside of Hell'sKitchen, back in the dorms--

20:28.399 --> 20:30.574
I want to talk to her, but Idon't know if it's a good time

20:30.677 --> 20:31.747
or not.

20:31.851 --> 20:34.336
NARRATOR: --the red team
attempts to do the same.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.027
Not before service, maybe.

20:36.131 --> 20:38.133
Well, I don't want it to carryover, you know what I mean?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.030
OK.

20:42.171 --> 20:43.759
This is not going to end well.

20:43.863 --> 20:44.657
No.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.486
3, 2, 1--

20:46.590 --> 20:50.904
Hey, do you mind if
we have a conversation?

20:55.771 --> 20:58.671
I don't want there to be
any tension between us.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.535
And I know that
there is right now.

21:00.638 --> 21:03.917
So I just don't want this tocarry over into dinner service.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.471
You said that I'm
not a team player.

21:05.574 --> 21:06.679
- No.
- Yes, you did.

21:06.782 --> 21:08.128
First of all, I was
put on the spot.

21:08.232 --> 21:10.234
What, your brain doesn't work?

21:10.338 --> 21:12.581
I said, I'm going to putup Elise because she says

21:12.685 --> 21:13.789
she works well by herself--

21:13.893 --> 21:14.756
And she needs to show that.

21:14.859 --> 21:15.757
She needs to prove it.

21:15.860 --> 21:16.689
Elise--

21:16.792 --> 21:17.862
I don't need to prove myself.

21:17.966 --> 21:19.485
I had to put you up there.

21:19.588 --> 21:21.072
I knew you were
going to come back.

21:21.176 --> 21:23.385
You ain't ever gonna bethe cause of me going home.

21:23.489 --> 21:24.835
I done sacrificed too much.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.077
I have too much passion.

21:26.181 --> 21:27.078
- But you're not listening.- You don't know me.

21:27.182 --> 21:28.356
You won't even let me explain.

21:28.459 --> 21:29.322
I heard what you said.

21:29.426 --> 21:30.737
But your problem
is, you like to talk

21:30.841 --> 21:31.980
and don't listen to nobody else.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.119
I thought we were friends.

21:33.222 --> 21:34.223
We were having
good conversation.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.709
You showed me that
there is no friends.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.400
When we talk, it's
going to be about dinner

21:38.504 --> 21:40.126
service, challenges--
food-related things.

21:40.229 --> 21:42.404
Don't ask me how your ponytaillooks, because I don't care.

21:42.508 --> 21:43.888
I'm not playing nice anymore.

21:43.992 --> 21:45.304
She opened a can
of worms that she

21:45.407 --> 21:46.857
better be able to deal with.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.789
OK.

21:47.892 --> 21:49.169
There's no friendship here.

21:49.273 --> 21:51.102
Because friends don't
backstab each other.

21:51.206 --> 21:52.414
Elise, you're
getting so defensive.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.894
I want my two
halibut, two lamb, Nick.

28:43.998 --> 28:45.102
Ah, one minute please.

28:45.206 --> 28:47.311
NARRATOR: One minute--
walk the garnish, bro.

28:47.415 --> 28:49.003
I'm walking.

28:49.106 --> 28:50.936
Lamb coming to the pass, chef.

28:51.039 --> 28:52.282
Halibut, chef.

28:52.385 --> 28:55.009
Blue team-- it's a great pace.

28:55.112 --> 28:56.148
Yes, chef.

28:56.251 --> 28:58.184
We a beautiful
symphony right now.

28:58.288 --> 28:59.496
[vocalizing]

28:59.599 --> 29:00.739
Want me to mix that?

29:00.842 --> 29:03.051
Yep.

29:03.155 --> 29:04.950
Van, you ready to go intothree minutes of the pass?

29:05.053 --> 29:06.123
Yeah, I'm ready baby.

29:06.227 --> 29:07.228
I'm ready on scallops, yeah?

29:07.331 --> 29:08.160
Can I walk?

29:08.263 --> 29:09.748
I got you right now, buddy.

29:09.851 --> 29:11.715
The blue team, we riding high.

29:11.819 --> 29:14.200
We got a bunch of
all stars here.

29:14.304 --> 29:15.926
Coming down-- backs, backs.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.100
Walking salmon behind.

29:17.203 --> 29:20.206
Hey, this is what Icall an energetic service.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.587
Yes, chef.

29:21.690 --> 29:24.072
NARRATOR: While the blue teamstrikes a perfect chord--

29:24.176 --> 29:25.142
So good.

29:25.246 --> 29:26.488
NARRATOR: --over in
the red kitchen--

29:26.592 --> 29:27.731
I'm walking with lamb.

29:27.835 --> 29:29.181
I'm slicing chicken.

29:29.284 --> 29:30.285
NARRATOR: Michelle and Barbie--

29:30.389 --> 29:31.700
Coming down.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.634
NARRATOR: --are trying to getin sync on the meat station.

29:34.738 --> 29:36.222
I proved myself
on the meat station

29:36.326 --> 29:38.431
already, because I
did all this by myself

29:38.535 --> 29:39.743
in the last dinner service.

29:39.847 --> 29:41.503
So I'm good.

29:41.607 --> 29:44.196
Let's just see how
Barbie does this time.

29:44.299 --> 29:46.888
CONTESTANT: Chicken.

29:46.992 --> 29:48.476
You said the chicken
was perfect, right?

29:48.579 --> 29:49.891
Cause I didn't double check you.

29:49.995 --> 29:52.549
It wasn't pink on the inside,and it had some shine, so--

29:52.652 --> 29:53.861
There was no
pink on the inside?

29:53.964 --> 29:56.139
There was no
pink on the inside.

29:56.242 --> 29:57.071
Hey.

29:57.174 --> 29:58.244
All of you, come here.

29:58.348 --> 29:59.901
And I'm not doing it infront of the chef's table.

30:00.005 --> 30:01.316
That's all of you.

30:01.420 --> 30:04.423
Oh no.

30:04.526 --> 30:05.665
I just touched that in there.

30:05.769 --> 30:06.597
Yes, chef.

30:06.701 --> 30:08.013
You can see it
And see it's raw.

30:08.116 --> 30:08.910
Who sliced that?

30:09.014 --> 30:10.360
- I did, chef.
- Wow.

30:10.463 --> 30:11.395
Doesn't surprise me.

30:11.499 --> 30:14.364
But, hey, she's
the best chef here.

30:14.467 --> 30:15.606
I didn't look
deep enough into it.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.401
I just opened it a little,and it looked fine.

30:17.505 --> 30:19.162
Ladies-- chef's table arrived.

30:19.265 --> 30:20.232
You fall to pieces.

30:20.335 --> 30:21.509
I'm sorry.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.442
Ladies, have we given up?

30:23.545 --> 30:24.961
No, chef.

30:25.064 --> 30:27.515
Well, you're cooking like it.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.482
Hot pan, chef.

30:29.586 --> 30:30.518
Sorry.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.865
What the fuck.

30:32.969 --> 30:35.557
NARRATOR: The red team hasdelivered just a few entrees--

30:35.661 --> 30:37.697
GORDON RAMSAY: Go on.

30:37.801 --> 30:40.321
NARRATOR: --while the blue teamis only a couple tickets away

30:40.424 --> 30:41.529
from completing service.

30:41.632 --> 30:42.633
Scallops going into pan.

30:42.737 --> 30:44.325
Robyn, I need about
90 seconds to--

30:44.428 --> 30:45.326
That's fine, I got--

30:45.429 --> 30:46.948
I'm working two
right now, darling.

30:47.052 --> 30:48.329
- You need help with anything?- No, baby.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.468
I'm making more blinis.

30:49.571 --> 30:50.434
I'm good, baba.

30:50.538 --> 30:52.057
I'm here with my boys.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.472
I love the blue team.

30:53.575 --> 30:56.440
Hashtag truth, baby.

30:56.544 --> 30:59.271
Darling, I'll run it for
you if you want me to.

30:59.374 --> 31:01.169
Van, you have tartar
sauce right there.

31:01.273 --> 31:02.343
You know that, right, baby?VAN: Yeah.

31:02.446 --> 31:03.482
ROBYN: OK.

31:03.585 --> 31:05.484
Behind you one more time, baby.

31:05.587 --> 31:07.900
Robyn, I'm not your baby.

31:08.004 --> 31:08.901
Thank you, babe.

31:09.005 --> 31:10.040
At all.

31:10.144 --> 31:11.386
Do you want more bone
marrow on here, baby?

31:11.490 --> 31:12.456
No, it's the perfect amount.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.837
- OK.
- Come on, Robyn.

31:13.941 --> 31:14.734
You got to hustle with us.

31:14.838 --> 31:15.943
I'm trying, baby.

31:16.046 --> 31:18.083
Hey, forget the baby
shit, would you, please?

31:18.186 --> 31:20.154
Hey, young lady--
forget the baby shit.

31:20.257 --> 31:21.603
Just sound like a pro.
- Yeah, just do it.

31:21.707 --> 31:23.088
- Yes, chef.- OK, forget the baby shit.

31:23.191 --> 31:24.813
We're not in a
fucking nightclub, OK?

31:24.917 --> 31:25.711
Sorry, baby.

31:28.438 --> 31:29.784
The next ticket--

31:29.888 --> 31:31.165
one halibut, one duck,
one pork, one beef.

31:31.268 --> 31:32.097
Yes?

31:32.200 --> 31:33.098
Yes, chef

31:33.201 --> 31:34.168
How long, Barbie?

31:34.271 --> 31:35.445
How long?

31:35.548 --> 31:36.618
Mine's resting.

31:36.722 --> 31:37.619
So--

31:37.723 --> 31:39.104
I just need a time--

31:39.207 --> 31:41.209
a direct, confident time.

31:41.313 --> 31:42.555
Mine is resting.

31:42.659 --> 31:43.902
So when you're ready to go--- Are you ready, that means?

31:44.005 --> 31:45.075
- Yes.- So three minutes, chef.

31:45.179 --> 31:46.180
Three minutes.

31:46.283 --> 31:48.837
Fucking hell, where has
the confidence gone?

31:48.941 --> 31:50.425
I would love to
try to turn this

31:50.529 --> 31:53.912
around, and show that, eventhough we have fucked up,

31:54.015 --> 31:55.603
we can bounce back.
All right?

31:55.706 --> 31:56.535
I can walk pork.

31:56.638 --> 31:58.123
- Garnish, please.
- Yes, chef.

31:58.226 --> 31:59.055
I'm slicing my Wellington.

31:59.158 --> 32:01.402
You walking?

32:01.505 --> 32:02.610
Pork is walking, chef.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.852
Walking Wellington.

32:06.476 --> 32:08.719
Beside you, chef.

32:08.823 --> 32:09.928
Right in the center.

32:10.031 --> 32:10.825
And the duck?

32:15.381 --> 32:16.727
Hey, blue team.

32:16.831 --> 32:19.627
Come here.

32:19.730 --> 32:20.628
Red team.
BARBIE: Yes.

32:20.731 --> 32:21.801
Line up.
CONTESTANT: Yes, chef.

32:21.905 --> 32:22.699
Quit yelling.

32:22.802 --> 32:23.942
Line up.

32:24.045 --> 32:25.633
Blue team, line up there.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.324
No telling what
might be going on.

32:27.428 --> 32:30.120
This All-Star season
has been crazy.

32:30.224 --> 32:32.951
I am done.

32:33.054 --> 32:34.090
Raw duck.

32:34.193 --> 32:35.608
Raw pork.

32:35.712 --> 32:37.956
I mean-- All-Stars?

32:38.059 --> 32:39.819
Fucking no stars tonight.

32:39.923 --> 32:43.685
This has been the worstservice ever by the red team.

32:43.789 --> 32:47.344
Send your last table now,blue team, and jump in here

32:47.448 --> 32:48.759
and salvage this shit.

32:48.863 --> 32:53.005
You five, fuck off!

32:53.109 --> 32:54.282
Wow.

32:54.386 --> 32:55.904
- I told you about that duck.- Don't scream at me.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.389
I told you that that
man was going to have

32:57.492 --> 32:58.286
a problem with that duck.

32:58.390 --> 32:59.494
Oh my god.

32:59.598 --> 33:01.393
The red team is just likean angry fucking pimple,

33:01.496 --> 33:03.464
ready to fucking
explode at this point.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.121
Robyn, jump on the garnish.

33:05.224 --> 33:06.363
Oh my Jesus.

33:06.467 --> 33:07.847
Red team, what's going on?

33:07.951 --> 33:10.264
The blue team is finishingup for you guys again.

33:10.367 --> 33:12.093
Walking lamb, New York strip.

33:12.197 --> 33:13.957
Lobster, Wellington.

33:14.061 --> 33:15.131
Who's going home tonight?

33:15.234 --> 33:16.097
GORDON RAMSAY: That's it.Go.

33:16.201 --> 33:16.995
Go, go, go.

33:17.098 --> 33:18.099
Thank you for your patience.

33:18.203 --> 33:19.204
Oh, my friend, thank you.

33:19.307 --> 33:20.308
You're welcome.

33:20.412 --> 33:22.207
Blue team, great job
in the blue kitchen.

33:22.310 --> 33:23.380
And great job in
the red kitchen.

33:23.484 --> 33:24.278
Thank you, chef.

33:24.381 --> 33:25.175
Stoves off, please.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.418
Send the desserts, thank you.

33:26.521 --> 33:27.315
Thank you, chef.

33:29.662 --> 33:31.181
I'll tell you
what the issue is.

33:31.285 --> 33:33.011
This shit was a cluster fuck.

33:33.114 --> 33:35.565
Everybody wants to preachthis team player bullshit,

33:35.668 --> 33:37.429
but I don't really fuckingsee it from everyone.

33:37.532 --> 33:39.155
Nobody takes advice from nobody.

33:39.258 --> 33:40.466
That's a problem.

33:40.570 --> 33:42.123
I didn't do
anything on hot apps.

33:42.227 --> 33:43.366
[interposing voices]

33:43.469 --> 33:44.574
Are you fucking
serious right now?

33:44.677 --> 33:45.885
I don't mean it in a bad way.

33:45.989 --> 33:46.748
No-- stop!

33:46.852 --> 33:47.646
Shut up!

33:55.205 --> 33:57.621
Everybody wants to preachthis team player bullshit,

33:57.725 --> 33:59.520
but I don't really fuckingsee it from everyone.

33:59.623 --> 34:01.246
Nobody takes advice from nobody.

34:01.349 --> 34:02.488
That's a problem.

34:02.592 --> 34:03.593
I didn't do
anything on hot apps.

34:03.696 --> 34:05.767
[interposing voices]

34:05.871 --> 34:07.010
Are you fucking
serious right now?

34:07.114 --> 34:08.184
I don't mean it in a bad way.

34:08.287 --> 34:09.081
No-- stop!

34:09.185 --> 34:09.944
Shut up!

34:12.878 --> 34:14.190
This is just how
I feel about it.

34:14.293 --> 34:17.331
I feel like the raw asspork set this kitchen back.

34:17.434 --> 34:19.126
That's-- that
was a huge fuck up.

34:19.229 --> 34:20.265
It's a double bone pork chop.

34:20.368 --> 34:20.955
It's gonna take a
really long time.

34:21.059 --> 34:21.921
I thought it was done.

34:22.025 --> 34:22.991
I honestly thought
they were done.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.200
It has to be cooked
all the way through.

34:24.303 --> 34:25.684
And then you didn't hearthe call for three pork.

34:25.787 --> 34:26.581
Yeah.

34:26.685 --> 34:27.686
I didn't.

34:27.789 --> 34:29.998
I will take accountabilityfor my huge fuck

34:30.102 --> 34:31.793
up and weeding the kitchen.

34:31.897 --> 34:35.625
But the red team is strongerwith me than without me.

34:35.728 --> 34:38.593
Barbie, at the beginningyou were micromanaging me.

34:38.697 --> 34:39.767
I wasn't micromanaging.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.044
You're telling me that
my scallops are done,

34:41.148 --> 34:42.425
and they're not done.

34:42.528 --> 34:44.116
Why didn't you say something?

34:44.220 --> 34:45.842
Barbie, you know I like you.

34:45.945 --> 34:47.119
OK?

34:47.223 --> 34:50.709
But what the fuck is theexcuse on that raw ass duck?

34:50.812 --> 34:52.366
What I don't understand
is how that station

34:52.469 --> 34:53.367
got so weeded with two people.

34:53.470 --> 34:54.402
Because there weren't!

34:54.506 --> 34:56.715
Because she was
supporting everybody.

34:56.818 --> 34:58.406
I don't deserve to be up there.

34:58.510 --> 35:01.237
I was basically by myselfwith the meat station.

35:01.340 --> 35:03.273
Michelle was everywhere else.

35:03.377 --> 35:05.448
You bounced through
the whole kitchen.

35:05.551 --> 35:06.828
That doesn't mean anything.

35:06.932 --> 35:08.175
There was a lot going on.

35:08.278 --> 35:10.522
That has nothing to do withhow you cook duck, though.

35:10.625 --> 35:11.971
If you're her
partner, why were you

35:12.075 --> 35:14.388
letting her send up raw duck?

35:14.491 --> 35:16.631
I'm not going to snatchmeat out of Barbie's hand

35:16.735 --> 35:17.736
and cook it.

35:17.839 --> 35:19.462
You beat your chest
so much as a leader,

35:19.565 --> 35:20.842
but you dropped the
ball on that tonight.

35:20.946 --> 35:22.879
Because, at some point,when does your leadership

35:22.982 --> 35:24.639
kick in and say,
we're going down.

35:24.743 --> 35:26.296
Let me take this over.
Barbie, I don't care.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.194
I'm cooking this.

35:27.297 --> 35:28.540
I was helping Barbie.

35:28.643 --> 35:29.782
I basted chicken for her--- But you never took lead on it.

35:29.886 --> 35:31.646
I'm not going to disrespectmy partner like that.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.545
She's that she's got
it, I handed it to her--

35:33.648 --> 35:34.960
Woof.

35:35.063 --> 35:36.824
She probably got a six pack onher jaws, because all she do

35:36.927 --> 35:38.895
is yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

35:38.998 --> 35:40.690
Like one of them little
ankle dogs that yap

35:40.793 --> 35:41.967
but don't do nothing.

35:42.070 --> 35:45.039
Listen, I take responsibilityfor the raw chicken.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.074
That was my bad.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.145
I'm going to be real with you.

35:47.248 --> 35:49.837
I think you skated
through service tonight.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.426
I think that you skated onthe responsibility of not only

35:52.529 --> 35:54.221
your station, but
you were bouncing

35:54.324 --> 35:55.636
around, running around a lot.

35:55.739 --> 35:58.121
I was back and
forth on fish, and--

35:58.225 --> 36:00.088
You fucking skated
through that shit like--

36:00.192 --> 36:00.986
I did not!

36:01.089 --> 36:02.160
I did not skate, Elise!

36:02.263 --> 36:03.713
You skated through
service tonight.

36:03.816 --> 36:04.714
No, no, no, no no.

36:04.817 --> 36:05.853
You skated through
service tonight.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.199
Elise!

36:07.303 --> 36:08.580
There's no way I deserve tobe put up for elimination.

36:08.683 --> 36:10.409
Yeah, I made a silly mistake.

36:10.513 --> 36:11.962
But it was a quick fix.

36:12.066 --> 36:13.447
What were you doing?

36:13.550 --> 36:14.758
I was on my station.

36:14.862 --> 36:16.139
- She got pounded.
- Yeah, I heard.

36:16.243 --> 36:16.795
- Thank you.
- I was helping.

36:16.898 --> 36:17.796
- OK.
- [hooting]

36:17.899 --> 36:18.797
You-- no, no, no.
You-- Elise.

36:18.900 --> 36:19.763
That's what I was doing.

36:19.867 --> 36:21.834
Elise, you asked
me-- no, no no.

36:21.938 --> 36:22.732
Elise--

36:22.835 --> 36:24.492
But what were you doing?

36:24.596 --> 36:26.425
Running around like a chickenwith your head cut off.

36:26.529 --> 36:27.357
No!

36:27.461 --> 36:28.462
That's what you're great at.

36:28.565 --> 36:30.464
Elise, you asked me
what I did all night.

36:30.567 --> 36:33.570
It's only fair that I askyou what you did all night.

36:33.674 --> 36:34.606
That's what I was doing.

36:34.709 --> 36:35.814
Boop to that.

36:35.917 --> 36:36.711
OK.

36:36.815 --> 36:37.747
All right, Elise.

36:37.850 --> 36:39.369
Elise is literally
obsessed with me.

36:39.473 --> 36:42.061
She will not let
anything I do go.

36:42.165 --> 36:44.132
She's just, like, on
my ass all the time.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.479
It's completely unnecessary.

36:45.582 --> 36:46.480
All right.
All right.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.343
I'm ready to vote.

37:02.323 --> 37:05.119
I'm lost for words.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.086
Have you six fallen out.

37:07.190 --> 37:08.605
No, chef.

37:08.709 --> 37:09.537
Elise.

37:09.641 --> 37:10.711
Yes, chef?

37:10.814 --> 37:11.850
What happened?

37:11.953 --> 37:13.265
I'm going to tell you
what happened, chef.

37:13.369 --> 37:14.197
No one took control.

37:14.301 --> 37:15.612
Michelle ran around a lot.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.304
There's people kissing
certain people's asses

37:17.407 --> 37:20.065
and not keeping it real,and it's a hindrance to us.

37:20.168 --> 37:21.791
Why are we on the
patio celebrating

37:21.894 --> 37:23.033
that we did good
in the challenge?

37:23.137 --> 37:24.311
We didn't do good
in the challenge.

37:24.414 --> 37:25.277
Nobody got a point.

37:25.381 --> 37:26.347
Nobody was celebrating, chef.

37:26.451 --> 37:27.348
We weren't celebrating.

37:27.452 --> 37:29.281
Michelle said, I
think we did good.

37:29.385 --> 37:31.179
I'm like, well,
there's the problem.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.595
No one here agrees
with her, chef.

37:32.698 --> 37:33.699
No.
No, no, no, no.

37:33.803 --> 37:34.873
The pork chops was wrong.

37:34.976 --> 37:36.495
She also sent up a
raw chicken that she

37:36.599 --> 37:37.669
doesn't want to
take accountability

37:37.772 --> 37:38.463
for-- well I didn't cook it.- She.

37:38.566 --> 37:40.154
Did take accountability for.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.914
Well y'all can continue
to kiss her behind.

37:42.018 --> 37:43.502
But I'm not, because I'm
here for a competition.

37:43.606 --> 37:44.710
Nobody kissed her behind.

37:44.814 --> 37:46.056
You don't like herpersonally, so you're trying

37:46.160 --> 37:47.195
to throw her under the bus.
- It's nothing personal.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.645
It's nothing personal.
- Ladies, ladies.

37:48.749 --> 37:49.888
Listen.
- It's Barbie, too.

37:49.991 --> 37:51.752
She's always finding
someone else to blame.

37:51.855 --> 37:53.857
She said the duck was rawbecause no one scored it

37:53.961 --> 37:54.755
for her.

37:54.858 --> 37:55.825
But--

37:55.928 --> 37:57.413
Communication is
still failing, chef.

37:57.516 --> 38:00.243
And I don't know if it'sjust egos talking, or what.

38:00.347 --> 38:01.762
But it's too much.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.350
We're not supporting one
another, how we should.

38:03.453 --> 38:04.730
Right.

38:04.834 --> 38:06.870
I was trying to support myteam in any way that I could.

38:06.974 --> 38:08.424
I was supporting
the meat station.

38:08.527 --> 38:10.184
I was supporting
the fish station.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.945
And I was spread too thintrying to help out my team.

38:13.049 --> 38:14.084
Listen.

38:14.188 --> 38:15.603
There were two people
on the meat station,

38:15.707 --> 38:17.916
but only one person
was cooking everything.

38:18.019 --> 38:19.814
This is what I
hear during service.

38:19.918 --> 38:21.575
That's not-- oh, no, no.

38:21.678 --> 38:22.955
She did not say
anything during service.

38:23.059 --> 38:24.232
No-- exactly.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.475
I didn't say anything
during service.

38:25.579 --> 38:26.304
I'm not talking
about you in general.

38:26.407 --> 38:27.201
Also--

38:27.305 --> 38:28.651
Listen.

38:28.754 --> 38:30.584
Ladies, can I just say,
this is really pathetic.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.320
There were two people
on the meat station,

38:42.423 --> 38:44.322
but only one person
was cooking everything.

38:44.425 --> 38:46.324
This is what I
hear during service.

38:46.427 --> 38:47.704
- That's not-- oh, no, no.- She did not--

38:47.808 --> 38:48.602
No.

38:48.705 --> 38:49.775
Listen.

38:49.879 --> 38:51.674
Ladies, can I just say,
this is really pathetic.

38:54.401 --> 38:55.816
Jennifer.
- Yes, chef.

38:55.919 --> 38:56.955
First nominee, please.

38:57.058 --> 38:59.440
First nominee is Manda, chef.

38:59.544 --> 39:00.372
Why?

39:00.476 --> 39:03.030
Missing three
pork set us back.

39:03.133 --> 39:06.896
And then when you asked topick it up, it went up raw.

39:06.999 --> 39:09.381
Jennifer, red team's
second nominee, and why.

39:09.485 --> 39:12.039
Second nominee
is Barbie, chef.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.316
Why Barbie?

39:13.420 --> 39:16.768
Because there was duckson there that were quacking.

39:16.871 --> 39:18.563
They were so raw.

39:18.666 --> 39:20.737
Barbie, Manda,
step forward please.

39:24.327 --> 39:25.604
Manda.
- Yes, chef.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.502
Have you plateaued?

39:26.605 --> 39:27.503
Absolutely not, chef.

39:27.606 --> 39:28.504
Have you lost your edge?

39:28.607 --> 39:29.746
Absolutely not.

39:29.850 --> 39:31.161
Are you a better
chef than Barbie?

39:31.265 --> 39:32.059
Absolutely.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.336
Tell me why.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.027
You said it yourself,I'm scrappy and I'm feisty.

39:35.131 --> 39:36.684
And I've never given up a fight.

39:36.788 --> 39:40.481
I've grown exponentially sinceI've been here the first time.

39:40.585 --> 39:42.207
I'm a team player,
and I think my team

39:42.310 --> 39:43.864
would stand behind me on that.

39:43.967 --> 39:47.730
When you are in the weeds,being a prolific delegator

39:47.833 --> 39:48.662
gets you out.

39:48.765 --> 39:49.559
Absolutely.

39:49.663 --> 39:50.422
But you said nothing.

39:53.529 --> 39:54.909
- Barbie?
- Yes, chef.

39:55.013 --> 39:55.910
Terrible service.

39:56.014 --> 39:57.049
Yes, chef.

39:57.153 --> 39:58.672
- Are you done?
- No, I'm not.

39:58.775 --> 39:59.914
Has the fight gone
from your belly?

40:00.018 --> 40:01.606
The fight's never
going to leave from me.

40:01.709 --> 40:02.503
I came here.

40:02.607 --> 40:03.573
I want this.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.057
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

40:05.161 --> 40:06.300
I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

40:06.404 --> 40:09.096
because I look out
for everyone else,

40:09.199 --> 40:11.547
and not enough for myself.

40:11.650 --> 40:12.720
And that's what a chef does.

40:16.966 --> 40:17.898
My decision is--

40:22.765 --> 40:25.353
Barbie.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.564
Wake up, and get back in line.

40:28.667 --> 40:29.565
Yes, chef.

40:29.668 --> 40:30.462
Manda.

40:30.566 --> 40:31.774
Yes, chef.

40:31.877 --> 40:34.466
Take off your jacket.

40:34.570 --> 40:36.054
Your time is done.

40:36.157 --> 40:38.401
You are a hard
worker, but you are

40:38.505 --> 40:42.440
not ready to lead the first everHell's Kitchen in Las Vegas.

40:42.543 --> 40:43.855
Thank you so much
for having me here.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.201
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:45.304 --> 40:46.823
Girls, guys.
- Bye, Manda.

40:46.927 --> 40:47.859
I love you guys.

40:47.962 --> 40:49.377
Be good to each other.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.724
Bye, Manda.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.898
MANDA: This did not end theway I thought it would end.

40:53.002 --> 40:56.108
I weeded our kitchen, andI'm pissed as hell about it.

40:56.212 --> 40:57.455
At the end of the
day, like, I want

40:57.558 --> 40:59.249
a better life for my babies.

40:59.353 --> 41:01.942
I hope that they know thatI'm better because of this,

41:02.045 --> 41:04.289
but I'm mostly better
because of them.

41:04.392 --> 41:08.466
So I can't-- I just can'twait to go see them.

41:08.569 --> 41:09.812
Listen carefully.

41:09.915 --> 41:13.298
You each now have
a 1 in 10 chance

41:13.401 --> 41:15.403
of becoming head chef
of Hell's Kitchen

41:15.507 --> 41:17.923
flagship, Caesars Las Vegas.

41:18.027 --> 41:19.062
Think about that.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.132
Yes, chef.

41:20.236 --> 41:21.030
Good night.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.135
Good night, chef.

41:23.239 --> 41:24.654
They're always going
to put me up first.

41:24.758 --> 41:25.552
I get it.

41:25.655 --> 41:26.622
But guess what?

41:26.725 --> 41:28.002
It's in the past.

41:28.106 --> 41:30.833
Guess who's waking up inHell's Kitchen again tomorrow?

41:30.936 --> 41:32.800
I still want this.

41:32.904 --> 41:33.870
Oh my goodness.

41:33.974 --> 41:35.251
When they were walking
down the hallway,

41:35.354 --> 41:36.390
you could hear them fighting.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.909
In front of the chef,
they're still fighting.

41:38.012 --> 41:40.152
The ratchet reds
are just ratchet.

41:40.256 --> 41:42.085
ELISE: Did they forgetthat this is a competition?

41:42.189 --> 41:43.017
I don't need no friends.

41:43.121 --> 41:44.398
I got plenty of friends at home.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.262
And I can have more friendswhen I win this quarter

41:46.365 --> 41:47.297
of a million dollars.

41:47.401 --> 41:48.644
Like I don't need
their friendship.

41:48.747 --> 41:51.716
I don't care if they everspeak to me again after I win.

41:51.819 --> 41:55.271
Manda said she never heardthe ticket that sunk her team.

41:55.374 --> 41:57.100
Sadly, she's not
going to hear her name

41:57.204 --> 41:59.655
being called as the winnerof Hell's Kitchen either.

42:05.246 --> 42:06.800
NARRATOR: Next time onHell's Kitchen All Stars--

42:06.903 --> 42:07.732

Huge fan!

42:09.009 --> 42:10.113

42:10.217 --> 42:12.046
NARRATOR: When Barbie'sgirl crush, Cheryl Burke,

42:12.150 --> 42:13.427
comes to Hell's Kitchen--

42:13.531 --> 42:14.532
Hi, I'm Barbie.

42:14.635 --> 42:16.016
I wanted to meet you.
You are so amazing--

42:16.119 --> 42:17.155
Thank you so much.

42:17.258 --> 42:19.260
NARRATOR: Will it become
a fatal attraction?

42:19.364 --> 42:20.848
I'm going to go cook
you some more duck, OK?

42:20.952 --> 42:22.091
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

42:22.194 --> 42:23.023
No, that's OK.

42:23.126 --> 42:24.438
Barbie, he said no.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.751
NARRATOR: --and send
Barbie over the edge?

42:26.854 --> 42:28.200
Please fire one
duck garnish for me.

42:28.304 --> 42:29.270
He said he didn't want it.

42:29.374 --> 42:30.409
Fire a duck garnish, please.

42:30.513 --> 42:31.445
Come on ladies, please!

42:31.549 --> 42:32.584
NARRATOR: This shit
is getting weird.

42:32.688 --> 42:35.173
Like, they see the crazy
in you like we all do.

42:35.276 --> 42:36.312
Chill.

42:36.415 --> 42:37.727
You two, sort it out--

42:37.831 --> 42:38.797
now.

42:38.901 --> 42:40.627
NARRATOR: It's all
aboard the crazy train.

42:40.730 --> 42:41.938
You're a lunatic.

42:42.042 --> 42:44.009
Cuckoo-- like One Flew Overthe Cuckoo's Nest crazy.

42:44.113 --> 42:46.805
Did she just call me crazy?

42:46.909 --> 42:48.738
NARRATOR: In an off
the rails episode--

42:48.842 --> 42:50.291
She wants to throw
people under the bus.

42:50.395 --> 42:51.569
This is not a bus ride.

42:51.672 --> 42:53.501
It's a train wreck.

42:54.502 --> 42:55.607
Choo choo.

42:55.711 --> 42:58.161
NARRATOR: --of Hell's
Kitchen All Stars.
