15:50.949 --> 15:53.018

{\an8}"Would you go home?"
- No, I'm staying here.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.301
{\an8}- The fact that Allie came
into this house

16:09.368 --> 16:11.337

is just kind of wasteful.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.138

Geles, plead your case.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.162

there's someone at home for me.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.003

{\an8}I'm not having a relationship,

{\an8}and not let me go home,
and if he lets me go home,

23:52.764 --> 23:54.299
{\an8}then I guess that means
we're broken up

23:54.366 --> 23:56.334

really like me, yeah.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.969
Yeah, I think

- But he does say
some stupid [bleep].

24:20.225 --> 24:23.328
- Point blank,
I'm voting him out.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.631
I don't think any of us
are going to change him.

24:26.698 --> 24:29.267
Like, I'm going
with my heart and my gut.

24:29.334 --> 24:31.069
- I know it's hard
to understand

24:31.136 --> 24:32.637
wanting Cam to stay--
- Yeah.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.339
My thinking was if you're
trying to get something

24:34.406 --> 24:36.341
going with Mechie,
won't it be easier?

24:36.408 --> 24:39.010
- It would be easier.
Honestly, it would be. But--

24:39.077 --> 24:40.478
- So what's the flipside?

24:40.545 --> 24:42.914
- The flipside is we do
have a friendship.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.951
And like, when I leave here,
I have to live with Cameron.

24:46.017 --> 24:48.153
{\an8}I think it's super important
for me to learn how to move on

24:48.220 --> 24:50.121
{\an8}<i>from Cameron</i>
<i>in front of him</i>

24:50.188 --> 24:52.123
{\an8}<i>because when I leave</i>
<i>this house,</i>

24:52.190 --> 24:54.593
{\an8}we have a few more months
left in our lease.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.994
{\an8}It's like I'm ripping off
the band-aid.

24:56.061 --> 24:58.463
{\an8}- We're not gonna have this
type of power again.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.799
{\an8}<i>Allie and Cameron</i>
<i>are neck to neck.</i>

25:00.866 --> 25:03.435
{\an8}Cameron, right now,
everyone hates him.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.104
<i>Allie on the other hand</i>
<i>has a boyfriend back at home.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:09.741
- What's the conclusion then?
- [bleep].

25:09.808 --> 25:12.744
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

25:19.284 --> 25:20.252
<i>announcer: Welcome back.</i>

25:20.318 --> 25:21.953
<i>It's the night of elimination,</i>

25:22.020 --> 25:24.856
<i>and the singles are feeling</i>
<i>the pressure because tonight,</i>

25:24.923 --> 25:28.393
<i>the exes have</i>
<i>all the voting power.</i>

25:28.460 --> 25:31.730
<i>- I know, coming into this</i>
<i>Cut Ceremony, it's 50-50.</i>

25:31.796 --> 25:33.265
<i>It's me and Cam.</i>

25:33.331 --> 25:35.800
<i>I came into the house</i>
<i>with a significant other.</i>

25:35.867 --> 25:37.402
{\an8}I'm still exploring
what I need,

25:37.469 --> 25:39.471
{\an8}<i>and I think a lot of</i>
<i>other people in this house</i>

25:39.537 --> 25:41.606
{\an8}<i>are doing that same thing.</i>

25:41.673 --> 25:43.475
{\an8}- Welcome to the Cut Ceremony,
everybody.

25:43.541 --> 25:46.278
- Hey, Romeo.
- Yeah.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.346
- All right, singles,
you were sent down

25:48.413 --> 25:49.714
to the Shack of Secrets

25:49.781 --> 25:51.116
and you were surprised
to find out

25:51.182 --> 25:53.718
that you're no longer
in control.

25:53.785 --> 25:57.555
Exes, you have the power
this week, okay?

25:57.622 --> 25:58.623
- Yes!
[all cheering]

25:58.690 --> 26:00.392
- Yes!
- It's our time.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.893
- It's nice.
It's nice--

26:01.960 --> 26:04.162
- All right, but before we get
to all of this, Allie--

26:04.229 --> 26:05.597
- Yes.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.899
- I heard you got flowers
from your boyfriend.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.801
What's going on with that?

26:09.868 --> 26:11.169
- It's a nice gesture.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.004
It obviously
makes me feel very special.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.639
- If you're gonna be a single
in this house,

26:14.706 --> 26:16.074
literally be single.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.877
When you're like noticeably
having a relationship,

26:18.944 --> 26:22.347
that's just not something
that I'm even down for.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.982
- All right, all right, y'all.

26:24.049 --> 26:26.918
I think it's time
to get down to business.

26:26.985 --> 26:30.922
So earlier today, the exes
voted on which of the singles

26:30.989 --> 26:32.490
<i>they wanted to cut.</i>

26:32.557 --> 26:35.160
<i>And one of those singles</i>
<i>are going home tonight.</i>

26:35.226 --> 26:36.461
Y'all feel me?

26:36.528 --> 26:39.264
- Yeah.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.599
- Kenya, Tevin,
y'all relationship

26:41.666 --> 26:44.102
seems to make a lot
of sense right now.

26:44.169 --> 26:48.106
Billy, Emily, y'all facing
your problems together.

26:48.173 --> 26:51.609
Aubrey, Coffey, please
step up to the pineapple.

26:51.676 --> 26:53.378
Last time when we
was all together,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.548
you were watching Aubrey go
about her business with Mark.

26:56.614 --> 26:57.782
- Yes.

26:57.849 --> 26:58.950
- Trying to figure out
where you fit in.

26:59.017 --> 27:00.118
You think that Mark is getting

27:00.185 --> 27:01.886
in the way of you
getting Aubrey back?

27:01.953 --> 27:04.522
- Well, Aubrey said she was

27:04.589 --> 27:06.191
{\an1}potentially falling in love
with him.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.026
That was the first time
I had heard that.

27:08.093 --> 27:11.229
{\an8}<i>- I'm a little taken back</i>
<i>because my exact words</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:13.365
{\an8}to her was,
"I don't want a relationship,"

27:13.431 --> 27:15.934
{\an8}and you start throwing around
the "L" word.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.335
{\an8}<i>And I honestly don't know</i>
<i>what I'm feeling</i>

27:17.402 --> 27:18.636
{\an8}<i>because</i>
<i>this is not what I wanted.</i>

27:18.703 --> 27:20.538
- I was not expecting this.

27:20.605 --> 27:23.508
{\an3}I think they're both
incredible people.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.811
{\an3}And it's--there's just
a lot of deciding for me.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.713
{\an3}There's so many
different elements.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.181
I'm trying to resolve

27:30.248 --> 27:32.283
the things I don't know
with both of them.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.786
And I do feel
the pressure of us

27:34.853 --> 27:36.688
getting toward the end
of summer

27:36.755 --> 27:38.423
and needing to make
a decision.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.593
And I don't want
to pressure Mark.

27:41.659 --> 27:43.895
And I don't want
to leave Coffey hanging.

27:43.962 --> 27:47.098
{\an3}I'm trying to just get
as many answers as I can

27:47.165 --> 27:52.570
{\an3}so I can make an honest choice
and not hurt anyone.

27:52.637 --> 27:53.805
- At the end of this,

27:53.872 --> 27:56.841
{\an1}we'll either be together
romantically

27:56.908 --> 27:59.077
{\an1}or we'll just be friends
and I'll move on.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.712
{\an3}- So you're calling that
the end of this

28:00.779 --> 28:02.814
is an either/or, no in between?
- Yes.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.516
- Did you talk to them
about this?

28:04.582 --> 28:06.217
- Yes, Aubrey knows how I feel.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.920
- I do now.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.188
- Take a seat.
Thank you.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.390
[applause]

28:12.457 --> 28:13.892
- Mechie...
- Mechie!

28:13.958 --> 28:17.195
- Kellie, please step up
to the pineapple.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.898
- I feel like the hard part
for me is seeing, like,

28:19.964 --> 28:23.435
Mechie spend time
with somebody else

28:23.501 --> 28:25.303
right in front of my face.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.973
I feel like Mechie still has
some things to figure out

28:29.040 --> 28:32.010
'cause he knows
where my head is at.

28:32.077 --> 28:35.146
I want to leave with
Mechie for sure.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.950
{\an3}- Listen, I met this
lovely lady right here.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.386
Listen, Ariana, she's dope.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.254
I'm just here to really
let her know, like,

28:43.321 --> 28:45.156
she deserves a lot more.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.192
I'm not gonna be able
to make no decision right now.

28:47.258 --> 28:51.196
- But he's going to have to.
Wow.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.565
- All right. Thank you.
Have a seat.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.868
[applause]

28:56.935 --> 28:59.304
- All right, all right.

28:59.370 --> 29:03.775
Lexi, Allie, Max, please
step up to the pineapple.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.710
[scattered applause]

29:05.777 --> 29:08.346
- Oh, my God.
This is weird. Okay.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.850
- All right, Lexi, how is
things going with you and Max?

29:11.916 --> 29:14.152
- I really think that this
whole experience for me,

29:14.219 --> 29:16.955
it's made me open up to him
in ways, and I've said this,

29:17.021 --> 29:20.325
that I have not been able
to open up to anyone in years.

29:20.391 --> 29:23.194
So yeah, it's going
well for me.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.931
- What about you, Allie?
- Lexi has a relationship.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.967
And I feel like,
for the first time in my life,

29:29.033 --> 29:32.070
I'm making my own connections,
like, on my own.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.906
{\an8}- This is an experience
for singles,

29:34.973 --> 29:38.109
{\an8}and you're not single
in the house.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.111
{\an8}<i>Like, I just don't think</i>
<i>it's fair for her to be here</i>

29:40.178 --> 29:41.679
{\an8}<i>when everybody else is,</i>

29:41.746 --> 29:44.249
{\an8}<i>you know, going through</i>
<i>rocky relationship [bleep]</i>

29:44.315 --> 29:47.018
{\an8}<i>and you're here</i>
<i>getting flowers sent to you.</i>

29:47.085 --> 29:48.453
{\an8}Go home to your boyfriend.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.356
- I truly have felt
that I have grown in ways

29:51.422 --> 29:54.259
that I haven't been able to
in a while, so--

29:54.325 --> 29:57.462
- Well, who else is over this
'cause I'm pretty sure I am?

29:57.529 --> 29:59.497
{\an3}- I think you're alone.
So we're gonna--

29:59.564 --> 30:01.900
- Okay, [bleep], turtleneck.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.936
{\an8}[laughter]

30:05.003 --> 30:07.138
- [bleep] turtleneck.

30:07.205 --> 30:11.376
- All right, Lexi,
Allie, Max, take a seat.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.412
[applause]

30:14.479 --> 30:17.148
Geles and Shannon,
step up to the pineapple.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.350
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.953
[applause]

30:22.020 --> 30:24.589
- All right, Geles,
it's time for my update

30:24.656 --> 30:27.158
to see how things are going
between you and Anthony.

30:27.225 --> 30:30.094
{\an3}- Yeah, things are going,
I think, really good.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.664
Yeah, they're going good.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.432
- Yeah.
[laughter]

30:34.499 --> 30:37.001
{\an3}- I never want to say anything
that's gonna freak him out

30:37.068 --> 30:38.870
'cause he's just taught me
that you can really care

30:38.937 --> 30:40.505
about someone
and you don't have to, like,

30:40.572 --> 30:42.173
jump in and be in love
with them day one.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.109
You can take it easy and slow
and you still have like--

30:45.176 --> 30:46.544
- You still got a problem
taking it slow?

30:46.611 --> 30:48.980
- No, I've been taking it
real slow, real slow.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.483
- How slow?
- I haven't said--yet.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.753
- That's a big thing.
[laughter]

30:55.820 --> 30:58.089
- Okay.

30:58.156 --> 31:00.291
- Shannon, let's talk
about you for a second.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.294
- Let's not.
- I remember, a few weeks ago,

31:03.361 --> 31:07.031
you was a little disaster
when your boo left.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.300
- I can't stay, I can't.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.369
Yeah, I was very--

31:11.436 --> 31:13.104
- You're looking real happy.
- Yeah. I am happy.

31:13.171 --> 31:14.472
- Confident.
- I am happy.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.673
I feel really good.

31:15.740 --> 31:16.975
- Got a little spring
in your step.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.910
- Yeah.
[laughter]

31:18.977 --> 31:20.211
- Okay.
- Just for you.

31:20.278 --> 31:21.646
- Now if I was a betting man,

31:21.713 --> 31:24.349
I'd think that you got
your eyes on somebody.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.084
Is that true?
- I do.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.387
I have a crush on Devin.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.489
- Spoiler alert!

31:31.556 --> 31:34.092
- Marie, you don't like that?
- Don't love it.

31:34.158 --> 31:37.128
[laughter]
- At least, she's honest.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.364
I love Marie's honesty.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.100
- Okay. Just tiny.
- So you and Devin--

31:42.166 --> 31:44.502
- Listen, Rome,
Shannon's a great girl,

31:44.569 --> 31:47.972
and she deserves
somebody that, you know,

31:48.039 --> 31:49.907
is going to treat her
right, so--

31:49.974 --> 31:51.542
<i>- You're not gonna make me</i>
<i>look like an idiot.</i>

31:51.609 --> 31:54.379
{\an8}This whole thing was about you
didn't want to hurt me

31:54.445 --> 31:58.349
{\an8}'cause you respect me so much.
I am livid right now.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.785
- Me and Marie have had
a lot of conversations.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.153
It seems like, right now,

32:02.220 --> 32:03.621
the best thing
for our relationship

32:03.688 --> 32:06.924
is to be in a friendship,
and I'm keeping my doors open.

32:06.991 --> 32:09.761
And if that door is leading
to Shannon, then, you know,

32:09.827 --> 32:11.362
I'm willing to take that step.

32:11.429 --> 32:15.233
- Okay.
- Wow, that's amazing.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.402
{\an1}- I wasn't expecting
that either.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.604
- So Marie, so what are you
thinking right now?

32:19.671 --> 32:21.839
- I don't care, Romeo.
- You don't care?

32:21.906 --> 32:23.241
- No, I don't give a [bleep].

32:23.308 --> 32:24.909
Why would I give
a [bleep] about someone

32:24.976 --> 32:27.011
that doesn't give a [bleep]
about me?

32:27.078 --> 32:28.880
- I think that's wrong.
- Shut up, Shannon.

32:28.946 --> 32:32.083
- I think he does care. No.
- Shut the [bleep] up, Shannon.

32:38.523 --> 32:39.924
- Why would I give a [bleep]
about someone

32:39.991 --> 32:41.592
that doesn't give
a [bleep] about me?

32:41.659 --> 32:43.328
- I think that's wrong.
- Shut up, Shannon.

32:43.394 --> 32:45.496
- I think he does care.
No, I'm not gonna shut up, no.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.964
- Shut the [bleep] up, Shannon.
Not the time.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.866
- You can't treat people
disrespectfully...

32:48.933 --> 32:50.535
{\an1}- Okay, here we go.
Let's go.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.236
- And expect people
to treat you back

32:52.303 --> 32:53.504
the way
that you treat them.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.840
I have a crush on Devin,

32:55.907 --> 32:58.676
and if that hurts your
feelings, I totally understand.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.781

34:09.847 --> 34:11.215

with myself,

coming in, just said,

34:12.984 --> 34:15.420

Two, he clearly
has low standards.

35:26.991 --> 35:30.561

35:30.628 --> 35:32.296
"Delete my [bleep] number."
