20:28.895 --> 20:32.599
I mean, nerve isn't
a strong enough word for it.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.000
Balls?

20:34.100 --> 20:37.069
I'm not gonna say "balls,"
and neither are you.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.771
We both just did.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.540
(sighs)

20:40.640 --> 20:44.043
It was wrong, Abigail.
You were out of bounds.

20:44.143 --> 20:47.179
Yes, I was.
I admit that.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.048
But it was
for the common good.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.850
You don't get to decide that.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.251
Well, I did.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.853
There was a conversation
that needed to happen,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.823
and you would be unwilling
or unable to make it happen.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.691
And you know this how?

20:58.791 --> 21:00.427
As the only significant
woman in your life

21:00.527 --> 21:02.295
who's not related to you
by blood or marriage.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.297
Well, that still doesn't
give you the right

21:04.397 --> 21:06.065
to pull a stunt like this.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.167
It's not a right.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.637
It's a very
occasional privilege.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.204
And some days
it makes me feel

21:12.305 --> 21:13.573
like the luckiest woman
in the world,

21:13.673 --> 21:15.508
and today is
one of those days,

21:15.608 --> 21:18.010
so yell at me all you want,
it's not going to change that.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.145
I'm not yelling.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.348
You yell really quietly.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.651
(sighs)

21:24.751 --> 21:27.554
Did he say anything
that was useful to you?

21:29.088 --> 21:31.223
Yes.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.493
He said if cops start
taking stands

21:33.593 --> 21:36.228
on hot-button political issues,

21:36.329 --> 21:38.898
then the criminals can just
call themselves

21:38.998 --> 21:41.033
the opposition party,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.470
and everything goes to hell.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.340
So to your point.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.709
And coming from
a Latino officer.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.746
Yes.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.717
Good talk. Back to work.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.887
(door opens)

22:00.987 --> 22:02.855
I don't know.
(door closes)

22:05.257 --> 22:06.793
Damn it.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.261
We have a major problem.
What's up, boss?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.731
I just found this tracker
in this jacket.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.834
Unlock your cell phones
and put 'em on the table.

22:14.934 --> 22:15.868
What the hell's going on?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.437
The only way those trackers

22:17.537 --> 22:18.505
get in those jackets

22:18.605 --> 22:19.939
is if one of you planted them.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.808
Phones, now!

22:28.648 --> 22:30.750
Let's see what we have here.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.153
OPERATOR:
Intel Division.
How may I help you?

22:34.253 --> 22:35.488
Ah, I-I knew it!

22:35.588 --> 22:37.256
I knew this prick was a cop.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.291
There's only one problem, Hader.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.394
That's your phone.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.129
Get his gun.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.196
HADER:
Wait, wait, wait.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.331
Whoa, whoa, no, wait.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.633
This guy set me up!

22:46.733 --> 22:47.967
He set me up.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.469
And he's gonna put a bullet
in your head.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.004
Dump him somewhere
no one will find him.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.473
(grunts)

22:53.573 --> 22:55.575
Let's get out of here. Walk.
Okay, okay. Yeah.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.278
(sighs)
What's going on?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.981
You tell me.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.150
This is the James Fox homicide.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.852
Yeah. And?

23:05.952 --> 23:08.421
Darryl Reid's confession
don't smell right.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.623
He used to be
your partner, right?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.592
Yeah. What about it?
Just wondering

23:12.692 --> 23:14.694
why you're gonna let him
go down for a homicide

23:14.794 --> 23:15.695
he didn't commit.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.997
Well, he said he did it, so...

23:18.097 --> 23:20.833
Time stamp on the surveillance
video says different.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.268
(sighs)
But, hey,

23:22.368 --> 23:23.736
you already knew that.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.237
So you either start
leveling with me

23:25.337 --> 23:26.573
or I'm out of here.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.878
Reid's taking the fall
for his daughter.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.213
Okay. I get it.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.848
But this is a really big ask.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.485
I wouldn't ask
if he hadn't saved my life

23:38.585 --> 23:41.153
on more than one occasion;
he's a good man.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.922
And I respect that.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.826
But rubber-stamping a false
confession, Danny, really?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.360
I know.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.731
Well, look, you know
how difficult it is

23:51.831 --> 23:54.100
to be a father
and be on the job.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.469
Tell me about it.
You have a daughter.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.771
If you had an opportunity
to erase

23:58.871 --> 24:01.307
all the times
you couldn't be there for her

24:01.407 --> 24:02.742
by doing one thing,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.777
wouldn't you at least think
about doing it?

24:06.879 --> 24:10.416
Look, I'd really like
to help you out...

24:10.517 --> 24:12.752
I'm not asking you to lie.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.523
Just don't flag the confession.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.295
You wanted to see me?

24:23.395 --> 24:26.232
I told you to drop
the shoplifting case

24:26.332 --> 24:27.399
against Brendan Todd.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.435
Well, you told me
to let him go.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.403
That's exactly what I did.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.540
What the hell is this?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.543
I released him because
there wasn't a complaint filed,

24:36.643 --> 24:39.245
and now there is.
By you!

24:39.345 --> 24:40.613
I witnessed the crime.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.550
You disobeyed a direct order

24:43.650 --> 24:45.284
to stand down on this matter.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.286
All due respect, I disagree.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.688
I did my job.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.957
By violating the chain
of command?

24:51.057 --> 24:54.927
I'm paid to arrest people
who break the law,

24:55.027 --> 24:56.062
even if they're kids.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.764
You crossed the line on this.

24:57.864 --> 25:01.634
Brendan's mom, she thanked me
for filing that complaint.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.637
She's worried that her kid
doesn't know right from wrong.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.540
Yeah. And that's on her, not us.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.408
(exhales) I'm not so sure.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.345
Corporation Counsel
is gonna toss this,

25:13.445 --> 25:14.947
and you're gonna
get written up.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.683
Well, I stand by what I did,

25:16.783 --> 25:18.317
and I'll take
the heat for it.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.853
You know, I get that the system
is messed up right now,

25:20.953 --> 25:22.555
but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying

25:22.655 --> 25:24.591
to do the right thing.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.829
Janko.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.302
You really want
to help this kid?

25:36.402 --> 25:38.905
Yes, Captain.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.307
Let's go.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.442
It's only a matter of time
before Quinn makes you as a cop.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.944
You know that, right?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.478
Yeah, not before we put you
and the rest of your network

25:46.579 --> 25:47.880
out of business.
(chuckles)

25:47.980 --> 25:49.682
You got any idea
what we do to cops

25:49.782 --> 25:51.718
who get in our way?
Huh? You got any idea?

25:51.818 --> 25:53.620
The same thing that we do
to human sex traffickers

25:53.720 --> 25:56.555
who buy and sell women.
What?

25:56.656 --> 25:58.791
I said get on your knees.
Hey. What--

25:58.891 --> 26:00.693
You can't shoot me,
you're a cop!

26:00.793 --> 26:01.894
Oh, am I?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.630
You ruined a lot
of people's lives.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.832
Wait, wait, wait. I, uh...

26:05.932 --> 26:07.399
I got money.
I got money. You want money?

26:07.499 --> 26:09.035
I don't want your money.
You deserve to die

26:09.135 --> 26:10.970
for what you did!
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

26:11.070 --> 26:13.205
(pistol clicks)
(cries out)

26:13.305 --> 26:14.573
(panting)

26:14.674 --> 26:17.076
Get up, get up.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.179
Good evening.
I'm Lieutenant Fleming,

26:20.279 --> 26:21.614
this is Detective Gallen.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.149
You guys got nothing on me.
Actually, Mr. Hader,

26:23.249 --> 26:26.185
you're gonna be charged
with sex trafficking.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.620
Sounds like something to me.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.189
Trust me, you'll be held
without bail.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.490
Screw all you guys.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.159
Now you know what it feels like

26:33.259 --> 26:35.161
to be one of your victims.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.395
Let's go.
Get him out of here.

26:36.495 --> 26:37.797
(Hader grunts)

26:41.567 --> 26:43.102
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.905
A day late
and a confession short.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.106
How's that?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.307
She read Darryl
Reid's confession

26:48.407 --> 26:50.710
in the Fox homicide.
Okay.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.112
"Okay" is the last thing
that is.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.847
The evidence
does not support

26:54.947 --> 26:57.249
the veracity of
Reid's statement.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.751
Oh, come on,
you don't know that.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.920
Oh, I do know that,
and so do the both of you.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.155
I told you this was a bad idea.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.892
What did you say to her?
I said nothing.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.493
Didn't have to say a thing.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.797
There is no way Darryl Reid
killed James Fox.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.531
Okay.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.667
But I can explain.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.135
Oh, this should be good.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.170
Because I can't
for the life of me understand

27:18.270 --> 27:20.239
how two seasoned investigators

27:20.339 --> 27:23.976
were dumb enough
to bless this false confession.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.413
There were extenuating
circumstances.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.816
Reid was my first partner.
He taught me everything I know.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.718
He's a great guy.
I don't care

27:31.818 --> 27:33.953
if he is Gandhi, Mother Teresa

27:34.053 --> 27:37.189
and Florence Nightengale
all wrapped up into one.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.758
If Reid doesn't do this,

27:38.858 --> 27:40.860
his daughter is gonna
go down for it.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.594
She killed her husband.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.131
To be fair, the victim was
an abusive husband.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.899
DANNY: Yeah, she was
protecting herself.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.235
And now Reid's trying
to protect his daughter.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.371
Then he should have gotten her
a good lawyer.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.906
We do not accept

27:54.006 --> 27:56.408
false confessions
in this office.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.445
And you two are damn lucky
I don't bring you up on charges

27:59.545 --> 28:01.680
for falsifying a report.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.817
Now get out.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.226
(sighs)

28:14.326 --> 28:16.095
They just told me you were here.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.098
Sorry to just drop in
on you like this.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.768
I thought we were meeting
for dinner.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.770
But unless you came by
to pick me up

28:23.870 --> 28:26.205
in your cool new ride,
like a friend might do,

28:26.305 --> 28:29.776
dinner's off, and you're here
to break bad news.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.210
How am I doing?

28:31.310 --> 28:36.515
I can't appear with you
before the city council.

28:36.615 --> 28:40.152
Not about suspending
Right to Shelter.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.322
Why am I not surprised?

28:46.625 --> 28:49.762
I am, uh, truly sorry.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.932
I'm not against you on this.

28:53.032 --> 28:57.870
I just can't be seen publicly
to be backing it.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.472
So it's a little secret
only we share.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.408
(sighs)

29:02.508 --> 29:04.877
Like I said, I'm sorry.

29:05.644 --> 29:06.979
(sighs)

29:07.079 --> 29:09.615
You know, some days it becomes
very clear to me

29:09.715 --> 29:11.583
what a difficult job you have.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.652
Yeah.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.155
You, too.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.293
That cliché,
"It's lonely at the top."

29:22.528 --> 29:23.595
You ever feel like that?

29:23.695 --> 29:26.232
Yes.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.867
It is.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.936
I know.
I know you know.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.770
Is there anything for it?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.639
Are you really asking <i>me?</i>

29:33.739 --> 29:35.774
Seems that way.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.977
(sighs)

29:38.077 --> 29:41.747
In my experience, not really.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.716
Some days I feel like quitting.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.652
You ever feel like that?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.055
Yeah.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.389
Lots.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.258
Why don't you?

29:53.826 --> 29:56.062
(sighs)

29:56.162 --> 29:57.864
Over time,

29:57.964 --> 30:01.333
I think this job...

30:01.433 --> 30:04.336
became my definition, so...

30:05.905 --> 30:08.340
...if I quit or you fired me...

30:11.978 --> 30:14.680
...I don't know who I'd be.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.883
Oh, come on.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.620
A father, grandfather,

30:21.720 --> 30:23.155
pillar of the community.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.025
Well, my kids are middle-aged
and have their own life,

30:26.125 --> 30:28.394
my grandkids are
mostly elsewhere,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.998
and "pillar of the community"

30:32.098 --> 30:36.402
mostly translates as
"forgotten but not gone."

30:36.502 --> 30:40.206
I had no idea
you were so hard on yourself.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.010
Or is that something
you trot out

30:44.110 --> 30:45.844
looking for some sympathy?

30:45.945 --> 30:48.380
I'm not looking for sympathy.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.083
You asked, I answered.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.119
Mm.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.988
Anyway, I'm sorry
to let you down.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.991
You have a good night. (sighs)

31:00.559 --> 31:01.760
Where'd they reserve us?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.562
Delmonico's, I think.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.564
You make other plans?

31:05.664 --> 31:07.866
No.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.701
Let's eat.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.370
You sure?

31:11.470 --> 31:13.940
There are only a number
of guys who know

31:14.040 --> 31:15.274
it's lonely at the top.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.109
And you can't just go around
saying it.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.211
You sound like a pompous jerk.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.982
Would we have to talk about
being lonely at the top?

31:23.082 --> 31:24.984
(chuckles)
No.

31:25.084 --> 31:29.922
But it's a club we're in,
and if we want to, we can.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.890
And that ain't nothing.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.894
I'll be waiting downstairs.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.910
Boss, where we taking the girls?

31:52.011 --> 31:53.845
Same place as Hader.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.082
Come again?

31:56.182 --> 31:57.483
We don't know how much
he gave the cops.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.451
We gotta cut our losses.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.587
Meaning what?

32:01.687 --> 32:03.855
Without evidence,
the cops have got no case.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.257
That's the evidence.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.325
They gotta go.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.659
So we're gonna kill 'em?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.328
You got a problem with that?

32:09.428 --> 32:11.030
No, but it's throwing away
a ton of cash.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.165
There's always more girls
where they came from.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.136
Look, I know a nice,
quiet place to torch the van.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.637
You and Fence follow me.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.811
I didn't sign up for this.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.146
Yeah, me, neither.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.249
Quinn actually wants us
to burn these girls alive?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.783
That's the game plan.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.119
It's not right.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.653
But selling them
into sex slavery, that's okay?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.355
I didn't say that, Dolan.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.423
Well, when you joined up
with Quinn,

32:37.523 --> 32:38.924
that's exactly what you said.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.937
QUINN:
All right.

32:52.038 --> 32:54.806
Let's light this candle up
and get the hell out of here.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.909
Grab it quick, come on.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.447
(tires screech, doors close)

33:01.547 --> 33:03.515
OFFICER:
You folks okay?

33:04.450 --> 33:05.717
You guys need any help?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.286
We're actually just
checking under the hood.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.521
Uh, you don't have a flashlight
we could borrow, do you?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.390
No problem.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.463
(women speaking in whispers)

33:21.633 --> 33:23.435
Appreciate your time.
Of course.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.837
Hey!

33:25.937 --> 33:28.440
Stay right there.
Stay right there. You stay put.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.009
Hey, don't, don't,
don't do it! No!

33:31.110 --> 33:32.744
(muffled shouting)

33:32.844 --> 33:35.347
Let's go.
Let's waste him.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.016
No, it'll bring too much heat.
He's trapped in there.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.285
It's a cop car.
He can't get out.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.452
Cop took himself prisoner.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.820
Light up the van.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.622
JAMIE:
No, we don't have time.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.157
He probably called it in.
The cops'll be here any minute.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.392
You're right.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.060
Let's move.
Let's go, come on.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.795
Now!
Come on!

33:49.895 --> 33:51.463
(sirens wailing)

33:51.563 --> 33:53.632
This is a waste of time.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.966
You go around
stealing everything

33:55.067 --> 33:56.368
that isn't nailed down?

33:56.468 --> 33:58.070
There will be consequences.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.271
Yeah, since when?

33:59.371 --> 34:01.173
Since right now.
This the suspect?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.508
Yes, Captain.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.343
Okay, you guys gonna
let me go or what?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.278
Oh, no, you're
a repeat offender.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.081
And the merchandise you
stole was worth over $1,000.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.549
So?
JANKO:
So...

34:10.649 --> 34:12.651
the crime you committed is
considered a felony.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.653
Yeah, what does that mean?
It means

34:14.753 --> 34:16.322
that it goes down on
your permanent record

34:16.422 --> 34:19.225
and you'll very likely spend
some time in a youth facility.

34:19.325 --> 34:20.526
Wait, what?

34:20.626 --> 34:22.861
Let's go.
Wait...

34:24.096 --> 34:25.197
I...

34:30.035 --> 34:32.638
Wait, how long do I have
to stay in here for?

34:32.738 --> 34:35.006
Long as it takes.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.384
What are you in here for?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.153
I, uh...

34:47.253 --> 34:49.087
I stole some things.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.557
What about you?

34:51.657 --> 34:54.326
I killed a guy on the bus

34:54.426 --> 34:56.662
for sitting too close to me.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.065
Guy kind of looked like you.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.179
(sighs)

35:15.314 --> 35:16.648
You get out okay?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.817
Yeah, I dropped my car,
took a train, hopped a cab.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.852
I dry cleaned for over
two hours, I'm good.
Quinn?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.421
He said to lay low
for a few days.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.889
Good.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.358
You've earned some down time
before you go back in.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.059
Are the girls okay?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.595
Thanks to you.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.397
They're getting checked out
at the hospital.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.798
We'll take their statements

35:32.898 --> 35:34.600
and then reunite them
with their families.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.134
And Detective Gallen?

35:36.235 --> 35:37.403
Not a scratch.

35:37.503 --> 35:38.837
Smart move locking
him in the car.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.506
Oh, he played it
just right, boss.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.474
Without putting
that tracking device

35:42.574 --> 35:43.775
you placed on the van,

35:43.875 --> 35:45.944
we might've had
a very different result.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.213
Good job, Reagan.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.515
I just wish we could've
taken down Quinn.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.483
Vics are safe.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.419
Your position in
the ring is secure.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.054
It's just a matter of time
till we dismantle this thing.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.889
Sir.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.094
You okay to stay inside?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.064
Absolutely.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.300
'Cause an assignment like this,
you know, it can, uh,

36:08.400 --> 36:09.835
it can get inside your head.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.738
I'm in this
until we take him down.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.542
Good.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.176
All right.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.714
(sighs)

36:23.949 --> 36:26.051
Banana fritters,
that's what you want?

36:26.151 --> 36:28.220
Yeah.
Anything for you. What else?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.922
Hmm, and...
How'd it go?

36:31.022 --> 36:33.058
Uh...

36:33.992 --> 36:36.762
Judge let me slide
on the false confession.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.531
Nia pled guilty to manslaughter.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.867
I wish I could've done more.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.270
Ah, you put yourself
on the line for me.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.137
I'll never forget that.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.039
What's she looking at?

36:48.139 --> 36:49.275
Six months.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.410
Probably be out in three.
For manslaughter?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.179
Yeah, well, they took
into account the former abuse.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.347
Good.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.782
So...

36:56.882 --> 36:58.484
What about this little guy?

36:58.584 --> 36:59.918
This guy?

37:00.018 --> 37:02.721
Nia asked me to take care
of him while she's up.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.324
Oh. Well, you know,
if he's too tough

37:05.424 --> 37:07.926
on you, you can
always call me, right?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.795
Yeah.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.498
(chuckles)
See ya.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.300
Appreciate you, brother.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.701
You, too.
Big time, man.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.569
Big time.
Always.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.271
All right.
Come on, big guy.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.640
You want me to carry you
or you want to walk on your own?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.442
You want to walk
on your own?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.344
Okay.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.713
(sighs)

37:29.881 --> 37:32.217
Six months for manslaughter?

37:33.151 --> 37:35.654
Sounds like you cut Nia
a real break.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.989
There's been an update

37:38.089 --> 37:40.992
in the Domestic Violence
Survivors Justice Act

37:41.092 --> 37:43.762
giving judges more discretion
in sentencing.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.864
Oh, I see.
Mm-hmm.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.766
You know,
you like to act tough,

37:47.866 --> 37:49.868
but I think
deep down inside

37:49.968 --> 37:52.137
you followed your heart
on this one.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.206
I followed
the law, Danny.
Hmm.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.879
Desperate times call
for desperate measures...

38:00.979 --> 38:02.581
(knocking)
AIDE: Mr. Mayor?

38:02.681 --> 38:03.915
Rehearsing!

38:04.015 --> 38:04.783
I just--

38:04.883 --> 38:06.217
I said no interruptions.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.353
I have to.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.154
The police commissioner is here.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.822
In the chamber?

38:10.922 --> 38:13.191
FRANK:
No.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.227
Here.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.596
Thank you.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.465
I'm on in a minute.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.999
Why are you here?

38:21.099 --> 38:23.469
Well, 90% of success in life

38:23.569 --> 38:25.136
is just showing up.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.305
You know that was
Woody Allen said that?

38:27.406 --> 38:30.442
I don't think you're allowed
to quote him anymore.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.744
Pillars of the community

38:32.844 --> 38:35.113
get a pass.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.587
What is this?

38:41.687 --> 38:43.889
All that I'm willing
to speak about.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.924
Speak about where?

38:46.892 --> 38:48.660
In the chamber.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.062
Up there by your side.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.199
And...

38:54.299 --> 38:57.135
"desperate times call
for desperate measures"

38:57.235 --> 38:59.270
always sounds...

38:59.371 --> 39:01.306
like...

39:01.407 --> 39:03.174
kind of desperate.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.943
Leave it out.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.746
Why are you really here?

39:09.615 --> 39:11.950
Because if I stayed away,

39:12.050 --> 39:14.753
I'd just be
a politician pandering

39:14.853 --> 39:17.055
to my base.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.925
I'd rather take
the hits from my cops

39:20.025 --> 39:21.827
than see their numbers cut.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.729
(knocking)

39:23.829 --> 39:26.398
AIDE: They're ready for you...
Two seconds.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.800
(sighs)

39:28.900 --> 39:30.368
That's it?

39:31.603 --> 39:34.072
(chuckles)
Pretty much.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.576
So...

39:37.676 --> 39:39.445
once again...

39:39.545 --> 39:41.780
hiding behind that badge.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.451
Well, I am more comfortable

39:45.551 --> 39:47.819
back here.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.631
After you.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.967
(indistinct chatter)

40:12.410 --> 40:15.413
That turkey smells
delicious, Erin.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.983
Well, it should.
It's your recipe, Pop.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.885
Yeah, but what about
the bread?

40:19.985 --> 40:21.653
Spent all morning baking it.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.121
I highly doubt that.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.558
Delfico's Bakery spent
all morning baking it.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.059
I just purchased it.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.162
The guy from my wine shop says
this Barolo is excellent.

40:31.262 --> 40:35.000
Well, then, I guess we have
almost everything we need?

40:36.367 --> 40:38.504
Yeah, almost.

40:40.672 --> 40:41.673
I miss him.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.074
Been three weeks.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.210
Feels like way longer to me.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.847
Any chance of even
the tiniest little update?

40:48.947 --> 40:51.449
I think you know
not to ask me that.

40:51.550 --> 40:52.784
I had to try.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.520
Just want to know
if he's okay.

40:55.721 --> 41:01.159
Your uncle's on a very
important assignment, Sean.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.395
And last time I heard,

41:04.496 --> 41:06.532
he's doing just fine.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.867
Good.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.401
How are you holding up?

41:10.502 --> 41:11.903
I'm not gonna lie.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.205
It's been hard, but...

41:14.305 --> 41:16.074
you know, I married a cop, so...

41:16.174 --> 41:18.677
Well, you married a smart one.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.378
And a tough one.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.513
He's gonna be okay.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.649
(taps table twice)
Hear, hear.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.517
(mouths)

41:25.617 --> 41:27.185
Let's eat.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.555
Hang on.
Gravy's still on the stove.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.690
JAMIE:
No. That's okay, Pop.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.291
I got it.
ERIN:
Hey!

41:33.391 --> 41:35.026
Hey!

41:35.126 --> 41:37.062
Hey!
(laughter)

41:37.162 --> 41:40.131
(gasps)
ERIN: All right.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.901
Okay, come on, break it up.
Group hug.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.571
I'll get you a plate.
Give me a hug.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.939
Hey, Pop, good to see you.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.777
Good to see you.
You look like a real dirtbag.

41:51.877 --> 41:52.944
(laughter)

41:53.044 --> 41:55.213
Those are some killer neck tats.

41:55.313 --> 41:56.114
Yeah.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.716
Don't get any ideas.

41:57.816 --> 41:58.850
I'm not,
I'm just saying.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.418
Missed you, Jameson.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.087
Thanks, Pop.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.590
We all did.

42:08.393 --> 42:09.928
Hungry?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.263
Starved.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.034
I think that it is
altogether fitting

42:16.134 --> 42:19.270
that our prodigal
son say grace.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.438
Ah.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.207
Yeah.

42:23.241 --> 42:24.910
Bless us, oh, Lord and these

42:25.010 --> 42:27.913
thy gifts, which we are about
to receive from thy bounty

42:28.013 --> 42:30.481
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.487
It's good to be home.
