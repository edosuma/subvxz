00:00.792 --> 00:03.879
God, Alice was being
such a dickhead today, huh?

00:04.045 --> 00:05.721
You give out
laser-pointer key chains,

00:05.846 --> 00:08.325
and you expect us to be adult
enough not to play with them?

00:08.450 --> 00:09.759
I mean, are you thick?

00:09.926 --> 00:11.795
You were just pointing 'em
at people's crotches.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.805
That's what they're there for.
That's fun.

00:13.971 --> 00:15.290
Dude, if she was here right now,

00:15.415 --> 00:16.450
I've drank enough, to the point

00:16.575 --> 00:17.751
where I would go right to her face,

00:17.876 --> 00:19.153
and I would say,

00:19.278 --> 00:20.988
"you're dumb and no one loves you."

00:21.113 --> 00:22.397
I'd say that to her.

00:22.563 --> 00:23.774
That was really good.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.108
You should tell that to her face.

00:25.274 --> 00:26.652
- Yeah, I totally would.
- Through her ear hole,

00:26.818 --> 00:27.794
which is in her face,

00:27.919 --> 00:29.363
'cause I just called her work phone.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.797
- What?
- Did you?

00:31.072 --> 00:32.031
- I did.
- It's her voicemail.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.367
Leave a voicemail.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.912
Hey, Alice, this is Blake.

00:37.078 --> 00:42.009
And I just thought
that maybe you should...

00:42.291 --> 00:43.510
Stick a fork up your butt
and eat poo,

00:43.635 --> 00:44.879
because you're a dickhead.

00:45.169 --> 00:47.281
Oh, my God.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.750
It's so sad how much you love me

00:49.875 --> 00:53.220
and you look at me from a distance

00:53.386 --> 00:56.014
and you get all

You don't know how to motivate.

Alice gets to the office
five minutes early every day,

02:30.141 --> 02:32.052
which gives us 29 minutes
to beat her there

02:33.486 --> 02:35.280
That's weird.
I don't even feel hungover.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.057
I drank, like, 17 beers,

02:37.182 --> 02:38.700
and I feel way better
than I normal do.

02:38.866 --> 02:40.160
Yeah, you know,
maybe as you get older

02:40.285 --> 02:41.411
you get better at hangovers.

02:41.577 --> 02:43.121
That has to be a fact.

02:43.287 --> 02:44.539
Whoa!

02:44.705 --> 02:46.583
- Jesus.
- What the...

02:46.749 --> 02:49.586
Guys, we're still drunk.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.130
We got to take the bus.
Let's go!

02:52.296 --> 02:54.382
- Yep, I'll meet you guys there.
- Wait, where are you going?

02:54.548 --> 02:56.301
- Inside. We need beers.
- Wait, no!

02:56.467 --> 02:57.385
Beers is what
got us in this situation.

02:57.551 --> 02:59.221
Yeah, and it's
what's gonna get us out.

02:59.438 --> 03:01.681
We're drunk right now,
and we feel great, right?

03:01.906 --> 03:03.917
If this hangover kicks in...

03:04.042 --> 03:06.587
- We're screwed.
- He's right, we have no choice.

03:06.712 --> 03:08.855
We have to stay drunk
till we get to the office.

03:09.021 --> 03:10.491
Oh, and I'll get

03:10.616 --> 03:11.899

03:12.024 --> 03:13.627
That way, we can monitor
our blood alcohol level, guys.

03:13.752 --> 03:14.945
Yeah! Blood alcohol level!

03:15.111 --> 03:16.430
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Adam!

03:16.555 --> 03:18.740
Let me get <i>tecates</i>

03:18.906 --> 03:21.359

Thank you for being a true Braj.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.439
You're welcome, Braj.

- Oh! Watch out!

I can't take it.

.06.

08:14.853 --> 08:16.796
I've never been so not drunk
in my life, man.

08:16.921 --> 08:19.416
- I'm about to be hungover, dude!
- No!

08:19.582 --> 08:20.967
We are not giving up! Okay?

08:21.092 --> 08:22.919
We're gonna go in that liquor store,

08:23.085 --> 08:24.861
and I will buy us some booze

08:24.986 --> 08:26.439
to replenish our body with liquor.

08:26.564 --> 08:27.941
- Yeah.
- Cool.

08:28.066 --> 08:29.508
Ders, I might need
to borrow a dollar or two.

08:29.633 --> 08:30.510
- What do you mean?
- I'm not...

08:30.676 --> 08:32.971

- Oh, he's passing out!

08:33.136 --> 08:35.280
- He's wasted!
- I don't feel good.

08:35.405 --> 08:38.150
- Are you okay?
- S'go... without me.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.652
- Go without you?
- Yes.

08:39.777 --> 08:40.953
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.321
Actually, carry me.

08:42.446 --> 08:43.481
It's very dangerous out here.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.108
Yeah. We're so close, we're so close.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.526
All right, thank you, ma'am.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.629
Don't act like you never
passed out in the street

08:58.954 --> 08:59.914
Energy drinks and beer! Where?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.417
All over the store.
Everywhere.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.245
- Hurry up, dude.
- Feel good, then not so good.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.338
This rock star needs a monster
can of red bull. Now.

09:07.504 --> 09:10.800

You're good.
Let's get this.

09:12.843 --> 09:17.390
- Come on.
- Tap it, and there it is.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.476
Remember that?
It's all natural.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.061
- What do you need?
- Burrito.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.197
- Handle that, okay?
- Burrito? Yes, yes.

09:24.322 --> 09:26.332
A little more of the medicine.
There it is.

09:26.457 --> 09:28.768
The doctor ordered some go juice.

09:28.893 --> 09:31.237
The doctor prescribed some go juice!

What?
You deleted the voicemails?

09:44.416 --> 09:45.835
Yep. I did a great job.

09:46.001 --> 09:48.988
Who is this?

09:49.113 --> 09:50.798
This is Anders.

09:50.964 --> 09:53.760
Oh, Ders!
No, I have not started yet.

this e-vite to my landlord.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.867
And then Montez sent out
this funny video

10:00.992 --> 10:02.401
of just dads sneezing.

10:02.526 --> 10:04.145
It's hysterical.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.732
It's funny, 'cause it's dads.

We're taking 'em just
in case the beer wears off.

10:16.007 --> 10:17.909
- Pretty smart, huh?
- Yeah, but that's P.M.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.869
Yeah, "P.M."
that's "power medicine," man.

10:20.035 --> 10:23.706
You take it to gain more power
in oneself.

10:23.872 --> 10:27.377

10:27.543 --> 10:29.195

17:21.122 --> 17:22.208
Dude, wake up!

17:22.374 --> 17:23.917
I can't see!

17:24.084 --> 17:25.252
Move your hair!
I can't see!

17:25.417 --> 17:26.170
- Move <i>your</i> hair.
- Move your hair!

17:27.838 --> 17:29.648
Oh, [bleep]!
Blake?

17:29.773 --> 17:31.817
Are you o...

17:32.092 --> 17:32.918
Ders, where are you going?

17:33.043 --> 17:34.253
Where are you go...

17:34.378 --> 17:35.763
Okay, Blake, I'm gonna call someone.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.391
Ders!
Ders, where are you? Okay.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.934
All right, what are we doing?

17:40.217 --> 17:41.827
What are we doing!

17:42.102 --> 17:44.021
- Jillian!
- I'm close.

17:44.187 --> 17:46.273
I've got her birthday,
social security number,

17:46.439 --> 17:47.525
ATM, height, weight,
skull circumference.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.776
- Move!
- What are you doing?

17:48.942 --> 17:50.277
- The only thing I can do.
- Holmvik!

17:50.443 --> 17:51.988
Put it down.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.531
Put it...
I said...!

17:55.866 --> 17:56.701
Zzz!

17:57.492 --> 17:58.619
Hup!

18:01.361 --> 18:02.248
Aah!

18:07.627 --> 18:09.805
{pub}So I know all this
might sound weird to you,

18:09.930 --> 18:12.907
but to me it's just OCD, you know.

18:13.032 --> 18:16.345
And I'm not suffering from it,
Alice, I'm living with it.

18:16.511 --> 18:17.746
Right.

18:17.871 --> 18:22.351
So your OCD makes you weigh
people's phones?

18:22.517 --> 18:23.885
Yeah.
And that's what I was doing.

18:24.010 --> 18:26.480
Yours is about, uh,
12 fluid ounces, give or take.

18:26.646 --> 18:28.189
That's fascinating.

18:28.314 --> 18:30.024
Hey, why don't you go out
into the parking lot

18:30.149 --> 18:31.493
and take care of your dumbass friends

18:31.618 --> 18:32.903
who are asleep there.

18:33.069 --> 18:36.449
- That'd be great, champs, okay?
- Very good. Thank you.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.916
If you catch me weighing
anybody else's,

18:38.041 --> 18:39.451
just give me like a...
We'll figure it out.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.120
Hey, wait!

18:41.286 --> 18:44.623
Were you trying
to listen to my messages?

18:44.789 --> 18:47.460
This is saying I'm locked
out of the system for 24 hours

18:47.626 --> 18:48.860
for entering the wrong password
too many times.

18:48.985 --> 18:51.663
No, I was, uh, weighing your phone.

18:51.788 --> 18:53.257
That was me.

18:53.523 --> 18:57.511
Uh, I was just trying to be
the best assistant I could be.

18:57.677 --> 18:59.597
Jillian, it's your birthday.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.140
Really? Today?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.225
No, my password is your birthday.

19:03.391 --> 19:04.876
Well, color me flattered.

19:05.001 --> 19:08.814
Jillian, you set it up, remember?

19:08.980 --> 19:10.515
Oh, now I do.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.234
But you never changed it.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.985
Could've changed it.

19:14.152 --> 19:16.245
Didn't.

19:16.529 --> 19:17.956
Jillian, I thought telling you

19:18.081 --> 19:21.183
to stay the eff away from it
[bleep] would be enough,

19:21.534 --> 19:23.018
but apparently it's not.

19:23.286 --> 19:25.530
So I'm just gonna tell you,
if you go near my phone again,

19:25.655 --> 19:28.626
you'll be back washing dishes
at Shakey's.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.738
I watched dishes.

19:32.863 --> 19:34.397
I didn't wash them.

19:34.714 --> 19:36.541
There should be a warning
right on the label.

19:36.666 --> 19:38.010
"It's not power medicine.

19:38.502 --> 19:40.379
You're not gonna gain strength.
You're gonna go to sleep."

19:40.504 --> 19:42.598
- It's P.M.
- Who woulda thunk.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.741
Dude, how hard did Alice snap
on us today?

19:46.017 --> 19:46.936
Crazy, right?

19:47.102 --> 19:48.771
- Somebody needs to get twirked.
- Yeah.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.455
I'm not gonna be the one
twirking her,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.831
if she treats me like that,
and I'm a good twirker.

19:52.956 --> 19:54.485
- We know. We hear you.
- You're a great twirker.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.162
She doesn't even deserve
one ounce of your twirk.

19:57.287 --> 19:59.298
You got to move your hips
like a figure eight. Damn.

19:59.572 --> 20:01.033
Yep, there it is.

20:01.199 --> 20:03.001
She's a freaking trick-ass b-yotch.

20:03.126 --> 20:04.436
She is, yeah.

20:04.561 --> 20:05.870
And I almost feel like
calling her up again

20:05.995 --> 20:08.499
and giving her a piece of my mind.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.209
Been there, huh?

20:10.375 --> 20:11.743
I thought of the best one today.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.378
I was like...
You know how you're always like,

20:13.503 --> 20:15.113
"oh, man, I wish
I could have said that,"

20:15.238 --> 20:16.481
after some stuff just happened?

20:16.606 --> 20:18.175
- Always.
- That's what happened.

20:18.341 --> 20:19.301
- What was it?
- Do it.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.252
No, I don't think I...

20:21.377 --> 20:22.954
You got to, man, if it's that good.

20:23.079 --> 20:24.682
It's ringing, it's ringing.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.600
- Shhh, shhh, shhh.
- I can't wait to hear it.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.960
Hello? Alice?

20:29.085 --> 20:31.863
Uh, this is, uh, not Adam.

20:31.988 --> 20:34.483
You are a [bleep].

20:34.649 --> 20:37.703
You're a [bleep].
You're a dumb [bleep].

20:37.828 --> 20:39.738
- You thought of that today?
- Yeah, earlier.
