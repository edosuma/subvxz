Kym Whitley in the house!

00:21.992 --> 00:23.824
Well, not my house
'cause I wouldn't have

00:23.824 --> 00:25.156
-all y'all in there.
-(laughter)

00:25.156 --> 00:29.029
Well, welcome to the set

-Whoo!

00:36.207 --> 00:40.711
We're taking a look back
at everyone's favorite moments

00:40.711 --> 00:42.843
and answering
some burning questions

00:42.843 --> 00:45.176
from our superfans.
And where my superfans at?

00:45.176 --> 00:47.078
(cheers and applause)

00:47.078 --> 00:48.919
Are y'all ready
to meet the rest

00:48.919 --> 00:52.083
of the cast
of Young & Hungry?

00:52.083 --> 00:53.924
(cheers and applause)

00:55.055 --> 00:56.987
All right, let's show some love

00:56.987 --> 01:00.161
for Emily Osment,
Jonathan Sadowski,

01:00.161 --> 01:04.165
Rex Lee, and Aimee Carrero!

01:04.165 --> 01:05.896
Keep it up!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.139
(cheers and applause)

01:13.274 --> 01:16.147
Well, it looks like we have
all the stars out here.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.978
(cheers and applause)

01:19.780 --> 01:22.082
We have a superfan waiting
to ask a question.

01:22.082 --> 01:22.783
(cheers and applause)

01:22.783 --> 01:26.887
All right, we have Desiree
from Whittier, California.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.888
Hi, Emily.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.260
Hi! (giggles)

01:30.791 --> 01:32.823
Everyone knows you
from Hannah Montana.

01:32.823 --> 01:35.065
What is it like being on
a different but more adult show?

01:35.065 --> 01:37.898
I could never
say "Oreo-gasm" on...

01:37.898 --> 01:38.969
(laughter)

01:38.969 --> 01:40.100
There's a few funny lines that--

01:40.100 --> 01:41.932
The funny thing
is that Rex actually has

01:41.932 --> 01:43.904
a wrecking ball in his room
that he likes to swing on

01:43.904 --> 01:45.105
-before the show.
-Yes.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.007
Emily: Yes, yes, yes.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.079
But it's great
and we have so much fun

01:49.079 --> 01:50.911
and the camaraderie
of the cast feels a lot like

01:50.911 --> 01:52.783
the camaraderie we had
over on the other show,

01:52.783 --> 01:54.915
and both of them
were very lovely experiences.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.086
(cheers and applause)

01:56.086 --> 01:57.087
Emily: Thank you!

01:57.087 --> 01:59.250
One of my favorite things
about Gabi is that

01:59.250 --> 02:01.121
she is able to
talk herself out

02:01.121 --> 02:05.025
of any situation
and others into them.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.128
-Yes.
-Let's take a look
at Gabi's shenanigans.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.231
(cheers and applause)

02:14.134 --> 02:15.336
She's so nervous.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.007
Listen to her babble.

02:17.007 --> 02:19.069
She's definitely
hiding something.

02:19.069 --> 02:20.971
No, no, I'm not
hiding anything.

02:20.971 --> 02:23.043
I just babble!
I'm a natural born babbler!

02:23.043 --> 02:25.015
My parents were gonna
name me Brook!

02:25.015 --> 02:26.317
I had a little bit
of car trouble,

02:26.317 --> 02:29.149
which involved jumping out
of it to save my life!

02:29.149 --> 02:31.151
And then I was gonna call you,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.954
but then the trolley
ran over my phone.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.955
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.228
Okay, so I didn't win Top Chef,

02:37.228 --> 02:39.029
and I don't have any awards.

02:39.029 --> 02:41.962
Heck, I don't even
have a boyfriend.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.294
But you know
what I do have?

02:43.294 --> 02:46.297
Lots and lots of debt.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.970
I think talking is, uh,
really the way to go here.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.971
You know, with talking, you--

02:50.971 --> 02:52.142
I just-- I wanna know
more about you!

02:52.142 --> 02:53.874
You know, like what
makes you laugh,

02:53.874 --> 02:55.045
what makes you cry.
Do you recycle?

02:55.045 --> 02:57.147
Have you been
to Washington, DC? (gasps)

02:57.147 --> 02:58.178
Thank you!

02:58.178 --> 03:00.251
And if she's not the best
interview you've ever had,

03:00.251 --> 03:01.412
I will work for free.

03:01.412 --> 03:03.284
No. Went too far.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.416
The point is
she will be great,

03:05.416 --> 03:07.388
and you will still
have to pay me.
Good day, sir.

03:09.019 --> 03:10.190
-Okay, can I just
tell you one...
-Shh.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.963
-...more thing?
-Shh, shh.

03:12.963 --> 03:15.926
My mom used to do this to me
when I talked too much.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.128
Oh, my damn,

03:18.128 --> 03:20.200
does that girl go
on and on!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.234
Kym, I love it when you say,
"Oh, my damn," on the show.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.075
-I don't say it that much.
-You say it so much,

03:25.075 --> 03:26.206
you started saying it
in real life.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.408
-Yes!
-Ah!

03:27.408 --> 03:29.940
-That's how you know.
That's how you know.
-Okay, kay, kay, kay.

03:29.940 --> 03:33.113
-Okay, kay, kay, kay.
-Wait a minute, you guys
have catchphrases too!

03:33.113 --> 03:34.245
That's all right.

03:34.245 --> 03:36.417
You know, I put this together,
so I know there's a clip!

03:36.417 --> 03:38.389
Show the clip
of those catchphrases.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.120
-How 'bout that?
-(cheers and applause)

03:45.195 --> 03:47.197
Magic gay powers, activate!

03:47.197 --> 03:49.099
(twinkle)

03:49.099 --> 03:50.230
Yay!

03:50.230 --> 03:52.102
Let me hear you say, "Hey!"

03:52.102 --> 03:53.203
All: Hey!

03:53.203 --> 03:55.035
Shwa. Shwa.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.036
-Shwa.
-Shwa?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.368
Too bad
you don't have a-- shwa.

03:57.368 --> 03:58.369
Shwa!

03:58.369 --> 04:00.210
That's not how you shwa.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.312
-Yay!
-(chuckles)

04:01.312 --> 04:02.313
Yay!

04:02.313 --> 04:03.444
Yay!

04:03.444 --> 04:05.115
Hey!

04:05.115 --> 04:06.116
Hey!

04:06.116 --> 04:07.147
Hey!

04:07.147 --> 04:09.280
Hey, Cupid,
or as I call it...

04:09.280 --> 04:11.322
(sing-songy)
hey, Cupid.

04:11.322 --> 04:12.323
Oh!

04:13.354 --> 04:14.455
People!

04:14.455 --> 04:17.257
I am Sofia Maria Consuela
Rafaella Rodriguez,

04:17.257 --> 04:18.329
and you're done!

04:18.329 --> 04:19.430
Shh.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.292
Never say your real name.

04:21.292 --> 04:23.163
Call me Lil So So.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.165
How much is it?

04:25.165 --> 04:27.267
-Uh, $15.
-Dammit! We don't have enough.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.140
Well, you don't need enough
when you got Lil So So!

04:30.140 --> 04:31.442
-(Gabi screams)
-Oh, my God!

04:32.443 --> 04:33.974
Don't scare me like that!

04:33.974 --> 04:36.006
I almost went
Lil so So on your ass!

04:36.006 --> 04:37.147
Let me see if these
are any good.

04:37.147 --> 04:39.109
Wait, hold on.
They're really strong.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.281
Bitch, please.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.454
You think Lil So So is
afraid of a little chronic?

04:45.185 --> 04:47.187
Oh, my damn!
Gabi, come on in!

04:47.187 --> 04:48.319
Oh, my damn!

04:48.319 --> 04:49.990
Oh! Oh, my damn!

04:49.990 --> 04:51.091
Oh, my damn!

04:51.091 --> 04:52.262
-Oh, my damn!
-Yay!

04:52.262 --> 04:53.263
We're having a baby!

04:53.263 --> 04:54.264
Yay!

04:54.264 --> 04:56.096
-Yay!
-Both: Yay!

04:56.096 --> 04:57.097
You have my blessing.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.198
-We do?
-Yes.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.970
Both:
Yay!

05:01.171 --> 05:02.202
"Yay."

05:03.203 --> 05:05.336
You know what I'd do
in your situation?

05:05.336 --> 05:08.339
Put a couple quarters in
and ride the spin cycle.

05:08.339 --> 05:09.380
(chuckles)

05:09.380 --> 05:11.081
Hey.

05:11.081 --> 05:12.082
(cheers and applause)

05:13.384 --> 05:16.417
Well, you know,
we love you guys

05:16.417 --> 05:17.518
and we're glad
that you're here.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.521
Um, we have Graham
from Nashville.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.322
My question is for Jonathan.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.496
-Moi?
-Rex: Man to man!

05:25.496 --> 05:30.160
Do you have any pre-show
superstitions or rituals?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.502
I have this weird thing I do.

05:31.502 --> 05:33.364
It's more-- It's not
a superstition or a ritual.

05:33.364 --> 05:35.335
-It's more of an OCD thing.
-It's terrible.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.038
I-- I burp before every take.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.269
(laughter)

05:39.269 --> 05:41.241
because I always feel like
I'm gonna burp or, like,

05:41.241 --> 05:42.212
have a hiccup
during the scene,

05:42.212 --> 05:44.214
and I feel like if I burp
before the scene, I won't do it.

05:44.214 --> 05:44.875
It's very strange.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.518
I pee and I brush my teeth
before every scene.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.179
-But not in--
-Every scene?

05:49.179 --> 05:51.382
-Not in combination
with each other!
-At the same time.

05:51.382 --> 05:54.054
No, not in combination. No.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.156
-Wow.
-That is pretty unusual.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.388
I do-- I do the, you know...

05:57.388 --> 05:58.429
(babbles)

05:58.429 --> 05:59.560
No, you don't!

05:59.560 --> 06:01.562
-You're so full--
-Ask Rex! Don't I?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.333
And you told me to stick
my finger in my mouth.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.395
Not your finger!

06:04.395 --> 06:05.596
-Oh! A pencil!
-Aimee: A pencil!

06:05.596 --> 06:07.568
Okay, never mind.
Okay, let's move on.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.271
-I'm so sorry.
Um... this is all bad.
-It hurts!

06:11.271 --> 06:12.342
(laughter)

06:13.404 --> 06:15.576
Just because we have,
uh, pre-show rituals

06:15.576 --> 06:18.248
doesn't mean that
we don't mess up.

06:18.248 --> 06:21.151
And what I'll tell you--
this group messes up.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.113
-(laughter)
-Not me.

06:23.113 --> 06:25.586
-No.
-Let's show you some
of our favorite bloopers,

06:25.586 --> 06:26.587
which I'm not in.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.218
(cheers and applause)

06:34.164 --> 06:36.326
-Jonathan, stop burping!
-I can't!

06:36.326 --> 06:37.428
(burps)
Uh...

06:37.428 --> 06:40.170
-I'm all gassed up!
-Seriously, that's so gross!

06:40.170 --> 06:42.332
-It's not gross.
You burp all the time.
-I have to leap onto you.

06:42.332 --> 06:44.234
I don't do it outwardly.

06:44.234 --> 06:45.476
What do you--
what do you do then?

06:45.476 --> 06:47.237
I would walk
in a corner and do it.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.278
Okay.

06:48.278 --> 06:49.440
Not in here!

06:50.441 --> 06:51.612
I can't believe
you brought me here!

06:51.612 --> 06:53.584
Where... (babbles)

06:53.584 --> 06:55.415
Juju, we're--

06:55.415 --> 06:56.416
(chuckles, clears throat)

06:56.416 --> 06:57.448
-Man: Cut!
-Boop!

06:59.419 --> 07:00.491
Why don't I go--

07:00.491 --> 07:02.392
Why don't...
(chuckles)

07:02.392 --> 07:04.525
-You can't-- Aah!
-Aah!

07:04.525 --> 07:06.296
-Both: Dammit!
-Dammit!

07:06.296 --> 07:08.398
Mrs. M--
Mrs. M-- (bleep)

07:08.398 --> 07:10.300
But they've--
but they've been on date.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.632
-But-- but--
-But-- but-- Aah!

07:11.632 --> 07:13.634
They've been on a...
(bleep)

07:15.305 --> 07:16.406
No! Ugh.

07:16.406 --> 07:17.508
Yeah, well, Josh has
to go to w...

07:17.508 --> 07:19.209
-Sorry.
-(laughs)

07:19.209 --> 07:20.471
To help you get
an apprenticeship,

07:20.471 --> 07:22.312
it takes you away from me--
God bless America.

07:22.312 --> 07:23.343
God bless America.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.315
-God bless America.
-(chuckles)

07:25.315 --> 07:27.317
-I'm not gonna be
able to do this.
-But you're ready?

07:27.317 --> 07:28.318
Uh-huh.

07:28.318 --> 07:29.650
-Start over!
-(chuckles)

07:29.650 --> 07:31.482
-(both chuckle)
-You messed up.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.484
Stop laughing.
You're making it worse.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.386
You reach in and grab it.

07:36.386 --> 07:37.457
(chuckles)

07:37.457 --> 07:39.229
What the (bleep)?

07:39.229 --> 07:41.361
(laughs)
Your face!

07:41.361 --> 07:43.393
I can't look
at your face right now.

07:43.393 --> 07:45.496
-Okay, I'm not gonna
look at you.
-Oh, thanks.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.467
-Don't even look at me.
-Don't look at me.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.669
My God.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.240
(person sneezes)

07:50.240 --> 07:51.201
Bless you.

07:52.202 --> 07:54.204
-Quit whining!
-(laughs)

07:59.309 --> 08:00.350
(cheers and applause)

08:04.615 --> 08:05.716
(cheers and applause)

08:05.716 --> 08:07.588
Kym:
You know, I love Josh.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.721
He's three
of my favorite things:

08:10.721 --> 08:14.424
young, good looking, and rich...

08:14.424 --> 08:16.627
(cheers and applause)

08:16.627 --> 08:19.369
-...which can make him
a little cocky.
-(gasps)

08:19.369 --> 08:21.401
So, let's watch some
of his cocky scenes.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.537
Julia Child was my inspiration.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.378
Whenever I'm in a predicament,

08:28.378 --> 08:30.380
I ask, "What would Julia do?"

08:30.380 --> 08:31.311
That's why I dropped out
of college.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.082
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.444
I dropped out of college
when I sold my first company

08:34.444 --> 08:35.586
for $3.6 million.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.549
I get it and I hear ya.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.252
What do you have
with your name on it?

08:42.252 --> 08:44.294
Corporate office building,
numerous magazine covers,

08:44.294 --> 08:45.355
the check I write you
every week.

08:46.356 --> 08:47.527
I exercise everyday
and I eat right.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.528
You've got killer hair.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.430
I do have killer hair.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.362
Thank you so much for that.

08:53.363 --> 08:55.736
That was chapter three:
Acknowledgment.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.708
See, Steve Jobs had it down,

08:57.708 --> 08:59.539
Dalai Lama had it down,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.772
and Josh Kaminski,
he's gonna have it down.

09:03.473 --> 09:06.777
Everybody wants a piece
of me today, huh?

09:06.777 --> 09:09.349
Popular guy.
Talk to me.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.450
Okay, this is kinda serious.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.352
Can I get sweet Josh
and not cocky Josh?

09:12.352 --> 09:13.353
You got it.
What's wrong, babe?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.425
That was kind of a halfsie.

09:15.425 --> 09:16.587
This is what
everybody's talking about?

09:16.587 --> 09:17.828
A bunch of stationary bikes?

09:17.828 --> 09:20.330
Guys, I rode a bike
to get here.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.332
This is lame. I'm out.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.434
(cheers and applause)

09:25.596 --> 09:27.437
Oh, wow.

09:27.437 --> 09:29.369
I have way better hair
than you do.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.441
-You do have amazing hair, Rex.
-Emily: Yeah.

09:31.441 --> 09:33.674
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
playing Josh, yeah,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.606
it's definitely easy
to get kind of caught up

09:35.606 --> 09:38.779
in being the whole rich
playboy, full of himself--

09:38.779 --> 09:40.350
Was it a reach for ya?

09:40.350 --> 09:41.682
-It's a stretch.
-(laughter)

09:41.682 --> 09:43.453
-The rich part is a stretch.
-Yeah.

09:43.453 --> 09:44.685
-(laughter)
-Um...

09:44.685 --> 09:46.416
uh, yeah.

09:46.416 --> 09:49.489
Uh, but I think the--
the biggest connection

09:49.489 --> 09:50.590
that I have
with Josh, personally,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.422
is that we're both big kids.

09:52.422 --> 09:53.824
We're both kind of nerds
in our-- in our own way,

09:53.824 --> 09:56.767
and, uh, and a trait
that I'm very proud of actually

09:56.767 --> 09:59.299
is that both myself, Jonathan,

09:59.299 --> 10:01.471
and Josh are very protective
of our friends.

10:01.471 --> 10:02.602
All:
Aww!

10:02.602 --> 10:04.775
-That's very true.
-You got all sweet on us.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.476
(applause)

10:06.476 --> 10:07.678
But we have another question,

10:07.678 --> 10:10.610
and that is Connie
from Diamond Bar.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.782
Kym:
What you got, girl?

10:11.782 --> 10:14.314
Rex, you and Yolanda are

10:14.314 --> 10:15.816
always making fun
of each other on the show.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.788
Does it ever hurt your feelings?

10:17.788 --> 10:19.319
(laughter)

10:20.691 --> 10:21.792
Well, I have two things

10:21.792 --> 10:23.353
I want to say
in response to that.

10:23.353 --> 10:24.655
The first is just
very briefly that

10:24.655 --> 10:26.426
Kym and I are professionals.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.498
We know that, you know,
the script is probably going to

10:28.498 --> 10:31.531
have one or both of us
insulting each other.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.533
And then I want to say
I know you wanted to,

10:33.533 --> 10:36.366
you know, whatever,
keep it light, but...

10:36.366 --> 10:39.339
when we started, I had
a lot of professional respect

10:39.339 --> 10:40.610
for Kym-- I just touched
your boob. Sorry.

10:40.610 --> 10:41.672
-You did.
-(laughter)

10:41.672 --> 10:43.473
Aimee:
So, that's gone!

10:43.473 --> 10:44.815
When we started,
Kym and I had

10:44.815 --> 10:46.777
-a lot of professional respect
for each other.
-Mm-hmm.

10:46.777 --> 10:48.448
But now,
two and a half years later,

10:48.448 --> 10:51.451
I want to say I love you.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.653
-Aimee: Aww.
-I think you're
an amazing mom,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.786
an amazing person,
an amazing artist,

10:55.786 --> 10:56.426
and amazing friend.

10:56.426 --> 10:59.659
-Emily: Yeah!
-I just-- My life is better
because you're in it.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.731
Aimee:
Oh!

11:00.731 --> 11:01.892
-Whenever...
-Aimee: It's true.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.434
-Whenever I--
-Jon: I've got a tear in my eye!

11:04.434 --> 11:05.866
-Wow!
-Whenever I get a script

11:05.866 --> 11:07.838
and I have to say
some sort of

11:07.838 --> 11:09.539
-"Yolanda's a big girl" joke...
-Uh-huh.

11:09.539 --> 11:11.872
...I think, "Kym Whitley:
big girl, big heart."

11:11.872 --> 11:14.504
-Aime: Aww.
-I love you so much

11:14.504 --> 11:16.676
-Okay. I'm gonna...
-and I'm so glad
that we're friends.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.849
-Okay?
-Damn! Thank you, Rex.

11:18.849 --> 11:20.851
(cheers and applause)

11:22.713 --> 11:24.384
Why would you do that?

11:26.757 --> 11:28.719
-Thank you.
-I'm so glad that we're friends,

11:28.719 --> 11:30.861
-and that isn't a joke.
-I'm glad-- I'm glad
what we're friends too,

11:30.861 --> 11:32.893
and next season,
I'mma have your baby.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.664
-(laughter)
-(cheers and applause)

11:36.496 --> 11:37.567
Golly.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.870
Oh, my God.
Where is Jim?

11:39.870 --> 11:41.701
We got someone else here
from Nashville.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.505
Emily, do the writers tell you
what's gonna happen to Gabi

11:45.505 --> 11:47.838
or are you just
as surprised as us?

11:47.838 --> 11:49.679
Oh. Well, I write
all the scripts, so...

11:49.679 --> 11:51.511
(laughter)

11:51.511 --> 11:53.413
-Uh...
-Ooh, that was a good one!

11:53.413 --> 11:54.514
Um, but no.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.846
I mean, it's kind of
a surprise for all of us.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.517
We don't really know
what's coming up,

11:57.517 --> 11:58.849
which makes Friday night
after the show

11:58.849 --> 12:00.791
and they hand us our script--
Usually warm.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.923
Our script for next week
is usually warm,
right off the press,

12:02.923 --> 12:05.625
and I get in the car and I,
like, read it before I go.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.657
I don't. I totally just lied.
I totally...

12:07.657 --> 12:08.829
(laughter)

12:08.829 --> 12:10.730
Every Monday--
every Monday we do

12:10.730 --> 12:11.902
a table read
for the network,

12:11.902 --> 12:13.563
and it doesn't matter
how many times

12:13.563 --> 12:15.505
you read the script
or how many times you imagine

12:15.505 --> 12:17.607
how each one of the--
of us is gonna say a line,

12:17.607 --> 12:20.570
without fail, every Monday,
we are completely blown away...

12:20.570 --> 12:22.612
-Yeah, that's very true.
-...and surprised by how
every one of us

12:22.612 --> 12:24.744
would deliver a line,
like, completely from,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.917
like, left field in a way
you never expected it to go,

12:26.917 --> 12:28.748
-and it's-- it's--
-At 9:00 a.m.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.921
-At 9:00 a.m. Yeah.
-Kym: That's true.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.953
Like-- like that's
really early or something.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.655
-It is!
-Dude, we have to
be at work by 10:00.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.827
It's crazy.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.729
That is true.
That's ridiculous.

12:39.729 --> 12:41.561
(laughter)

12:41.561 --> 12:42.762
I can never make it on time.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.965
-Um...
-(laughter)

12:44.965 --> 12:47.497
When we come back,
we're gonna take a look

12:47.497 --> 12:48.899
at the heart of the show:

12:48.899 --> 12:52.442
the romance
between Josh and Gabi.

12:52.442 --> 12:53.573
(cheers and applause)

12:55.745 --> 12:57.777
In the meantime,
take a look at this.

13:00.911 --> 13:01.982
Man: Action!

13:01.982 --> 13:05.615
Gabi:
Okay, party's over.
Time to go. Bye.

13:05.615 --> 13:06.616
(laughs)

13:07.988 --> 13:09.559
Oh, no!

13:11.021 --> 13:12.792
Nooooo!

13:12.792 --> 13:15.625
-Why aren't the doors closing?
-Nooooo!

13:16.696 --> 13:17.327
(clattering)

13:17.327 --> 13:19.799
-He's so freaked out
that his mother's coming.
-(clattering)

13:21.631 --> 13:22.732
Anyway...

13:22.732 --> 13:23.803
-I'm sorry.
-(Emily laughs)

13:23.803 --> 13:26.676
Chef Rinaldo?
What is his name?

13:26.676 --> 13:29.679
Chef D'Aby. "D'Aby"?
What the hell?

13:29.679 --> 13:31.711
And then it hit me: D'Abney.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.984
That's not his name!
His name is D'Arby!
(bleep)

13:33.984 --> 13:36.516
All you have to do
is start eating one of these

13:36.516 --> 13:37.988
the moment you get
on the elevator...

13:39.719 --> 13:40.820
Nothing. It's--

13:42.552 --> 13:43.623
It's the boobs.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.694
(thud)

13:45.695 --> 13:46.726
Man:
And cut.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.729
(cheers and applause)

13:49.729 --> 13:53.703
Okay, we got Edna
from Palm Springs, California.

13:53.703 --> 13:55.966
Okay, this question is
for the entire cast.

13:55.966 --> 13:58.808
What kind of jobs
did you guys have
before you started acting?

13:58.808 --> 14:01.041
Um, I used to be a waiter,

14:01.041 --> 14:03.874
like a lot of, you know,
actors that move to Los Angeles,

14:03.874 --> 14:05.946
and my favorite thing
about it was

14:05.946 --> 14:07.747
sometimes they'd
let me bartend,

14:07.747 --> 14:09.880
and whenever someone would
send back a cocktail, like,

14:09.880 --> 14:11.081
if they, you know,
ordered it, like,

14:11.081 --> 14:12.883
with a twist and I'd give
an olive by mistake,

14:12.883 --> 14:14.955
I'd put it into, like,
a to go soup cup

14:14.955 --> 14:17.787
and take it to my locker
and sip it all night.

14:17.787 --> 14:19.589
-(laughter)
-(cheers and applause)

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
Gotta start-- you gotta
start somewhere. Damn.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.865
I was a barista,
and weird people would,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.567
like, weird, famous people
would come in and--

14:27.567 --> 14:28.268
What's a barista?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.800
-Uh, a person who makes coffee.
-Emily: Yeah, makes coffee.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.042
Hey, that's the coffee maker.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.873
(laughter)

14:33.873 --> 14:35.705
Kym:
What is it?

14:35.705 --> 14:37.707
-Well, you just--
-Okay!

14:37.707 --> 14:38.748
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

14:38.748 --> 14:40.050
You're just fancy! Quit it!

14:40.050 --> 14:41.881
"Barista."

14:41.881 --> 14:44.784
Okay, now we're gonna
get down to the nitty-gritty.

14:44.784 --> 14:49.689
We have a question from someone
who's from Poland... Ava.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.692
Uh, so on the show, Elliot is
the only one who's married.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.964
I was wondering,
in real life,

14:53.964 --> 14:55.895
what is everyone's
relationship status?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.898
(cheers and applause)

14:58.898 --> 15:01.771
So I'll start
because I'm the saddest case.

15:01.771 --> 15:03.934
Yes, Elliot's--
Elliot's the one that's married,

15:03.934 --> 15:06.676
but in real life,
they're engaged,

15:06.676 --> 15:07.938
they both get some,

15:07.938 --> 15:08.939
single, single, single.

15:08.939 --> 15:09.940
(laughter)

15:09.940 --> 15:11.942
Single, single, single.
Nobody wants me.

15:11.942 --> 15:12.612
Oh, that's not true.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.116
-That's not true.
-Rex, the whole country
of Australia wants you!

15:16.116 --> 15:18.788
-Well, I don't live there, do I?
-Very true.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.852
(Russian accent)
I thought it never happen,

15:22.852 --> 15:23.994
but, uh, I'm in love!

15:23.994 --> 15:25.025
He's in love!

15:25.025 --> 15:27.157
Yolanda is "bee'z kneez!"

15:27.157 --> 15:28.758
Yeah!

15:28.758 --> 15:31.161
She is totally "bee'z kneez."

15:31.161 --> 15:33.763
Good morning, beautiful people.

15:33.763 --> 15:35.765
You know who's starving? Me.

15:35.765 --> 15:36.806
You know why? Sex.

15:36.806 --> 15:37.807
You know how much? Tons.

15:37.807 --> 15:39.139
I love you too.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.770
(coughs)

15:40.770 --> 15:42.842
I've thought about you
every single night

15:42.842 --> 15:45.115
since we made love
on that ferris wheel.

15:45.115 --> 15:48.118
It just keeps going round
and round in my mind like a--

15:48.118 --> 15:49.849
I don't know,
ferris wheel?

15:49.849 --> 15:51.121
How old are you?!

15:51.121 --> 15:53.023
Age is just a number.

15:53.023 --> 15:55.155
Yeah. What is the number?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.686
This guy is flirting with me

15:56.686 --> 15:57.827
because he thinks
I'm a man, right?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.161
(deep voice)
Hi, I'm Frank.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.034
Aw, that is the tiniest bottle

16:04.034 --> 16:05.996
of olive oil I've ever seen.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.837
It's so cute.

16:07.837 --> 16:10.170
I have a perfectly
normal-sized penis!

16:11.171 --> 16:14.004
I-- Hi...

16:14.004 --> 16:15.045
Sofia:
Ruben!

16:18.178 --> 16:19.909
(twinkle)

16:19.909 --> 16:21.851
Hey! (giggles)

16:21.851 --> 16:24.054
This is a ruse.
You're not gay.

16:24.054 --> 16:25.755
Oh, yeah?

16:28.018 --> 16:31.721
You don't by any chance
have any Jewish in you?

16:31.721 --> 16:32.992
I do not...

16:32.992 --> 16:34.824
but the evening is young.

16:34.824 --> 16:35.995
(both laugh)

16:35.995 --> 16:38.028
Shauna, if I didn't know
any better, I'd think
you were trying to

16:38.028 --> 16:40.030
-hide something from me.
-How about we hide
something later?

16:43.173 --> 16:44.934
I'm sorry, but I like
a happy ending.

16:44.934 --> 16:46.736
Duly noted.

16:46.736 --> 16:48.078
If you two are so in love,

16:48.078 --> 16:50.009
why don't you lay
a kiss on her?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.843
Both:
Denzel, Denzel, Denzel...

16:53.843 --> 16:55.045
Gabi just gonna have to
get over this car!

16:55.045 --> 16:56.886
Limo sex?

16:56.886 --> 16:58.848
Is there any other kind?

16:58.848 --> 17:00.019
-Get over here.
-(giggles)

17:00.019 --> 17:01.891
If you care about her,
you gotta leave her alone,

17:01.891 --> 17:03.953
because when it comes to you,
she has no self-control.

17:03.953 --> 17:05.125
The hell I don't!

17:07.057 --> 17:08.058
Hello.

17:08.058 --> 17:09.229
Where do you get
these teeth from?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.302
-I break into morgues.
-(laughs)

17:12.302 --> 17:14.104
She breaks into--
yep, time to go.

17:14.104 --> 17:16.236
You gotta admit,
we were good

17:16.236 --> 17:17.907
steaming up that screen.

17:17.907 --> 17:19.909
(cheering)

17:19.909 --> 17:23.243
But there's one couple that
we tune in every week to watch--

17:23.243 --> 17:24.244
Elliot and Alan?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.815
Shut up, fool!

17:25.815 --> 17:27.917
Josh and Gabi!

17:27.917 --> 17:29.079
(cheers and applause)

17:36.256 --> 17:37.887
-Who is this?
-Hopefully your new chef.

17:37.887 --> 17:40.160
-You made an amazing dinner.
-Wait till you see dessert.

17:41.831 --> 17:42.892
-Did we--
-We did.

17:42.892 --> 17:43.963
-Are you sure?
-So sure.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.166
-I never should have
slept with him.
-Oh, you think?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.968
-I'm in!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow your roll!

17:48.968 --> 17:50.240
-Great talk.
-Yabba-dabba.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.901
-Are we in a--
-I'm not pregnant.

17:51.901 --> 17:53.773
-Oh, thank God.
-Nope. You are jealous.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.275
Jealous of what?
You heard him!
He lives on nine!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.946
Gabi:
What are we?

17:56.946 --> 17:59.909
Friends, boss/employee,
one-time drunken hookup?

17:59.909 --> 18:00.910
All of the above.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.352
No, Josh is supposed to
be getting married

18:02.352 --> 18:04.184
six months from now,
not-- not now. Not now!

18:04.184 --> 18:05.315
Cooper flew in from China

18:05.315 --> 18:07.016
and surprised me
in the middle of the night.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.218
Both:
Cooper?

18:09.359 --> 18:11.321
China gets cold,
so why don't you
take that with you?

18:12.362 --> 18:13.963
Josh--

18:15.225 --> 18:17.167
Gabi!

18:17.167 --> 18:18.168
I love you.

18:18.168 --> 18:19.329
Gabi:
He told me that he loved me.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.171
-I felt nothing.
-I'm glad you came by.

18:21.171 --> 18:22.832
I don't think
we finished our con--

18:22.832 --> 18:24.134
Josh...

18:24.134 --> 18:25.835
it's you.

18:25.835 --> 18:27.977
-Stop, stop, stop!
-(screaming)

18:27.977 --> 18:29.008
I can't take this, okay?
I quit!

18:29.008 --> 18:30.980
-Josh, I really wanna
be your chef.
-Girlfriend.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.011
Chef. Yes.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.843
Son of a bitch.

18:33.843 --> 18:36.045
You pulled the rug out
from under me, Gabi!

18:36.045 --> 18:38.017
Got this food truck
for me and Gabi!

18:38.017 --> 18:39.889
-What a piece of--
-I love it!

18:39.889 --> 18:41.151
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

18:42.952 --> 18:43.953
Josh:
I'm crazy about you.

18:43.953 --> 18:45.195
I always have been.

18:47.897 --> 18:49.128
Gabi:
It's not a dream!

18:49.128 --> 18:50.960
Do you know how long
I've waited for this?

18:50.960 --> 18:53.062
A year and three months.
Roughly.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.164
(gasps)

18:54.164 --> 18:55.305
(elevator dings)

19:04.914 --> 19:06.075
(door opens)

19:07.116 --> 19:08.218
-(door closes)
-(ding)

19:09.279 --> 19:11.050
(applause)

19:12.051 --> 19:13.253
Y'all crazy!

19:13.253 --> 19:14.384
Whoo!

19:14.384 --> 19:17.126
Uh, now, I heard
you talking, boo.

19:17.126 --> 19:18.258
What's your question?

19:18.258 --> 19:20.190
-Hey, guys.
-Jon: Hey!

19:20.190 --> 19:21.361
Uh, I just wanted to know
what you think

19:21.361 --> 19:24.434
if Gabi and Josh ever get
their happily ever after.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.366
I don't know.
I haven't talked to the writers.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.038
-But--
-I have.

19:29.038 --> 19:29.739
(laughter)

19:29.739 --> 19:33.273
I mean, you gotta admit,
it's kind of fun watching
the ups and downs, right?

19:33.273 --> 19:34.374
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.276
We're kind of taking
the audience on a ride.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.208
Yeah, I don't--
I mean, even--

19:38.208 --> 19:41.050
and this is my opinion,
I don't think it's about

19:41.050 --> 19:43.253
whether they wind up together
or they don't wind up together.

19:43.253 --> 19:46.015
I think it's about
how they get to being together
or not being together.

19:46.015 --> 19:48.388
-I think it's the whole process
along the-- the show.
-It's the chase, yeah.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.089
-It's the climb.
-It's the climb.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.191
-Hey, guys...
-No.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.264
-Rex: Why is this show
all about her?
-Jon: It really is.

19:54.264 --> 19:55.425
Aimee Carrero!

19:55.425 --> 19:57.026
How's it going?

19:57.026 --> 19:58.197
(cheers and applause)

19:59.299 --> 20:00.900
Well-- well, guess what?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.403
I want us all to find love,
but we're out of time!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.275
And my Spanx is rolling down.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.239
But I know one thing is that
we could not have done this

20:09.239 --> 20:11.281
without each one of you.

20:11.281 --> 20:14.043
Thank you to
our Young & Hungry fans.

20:14.043 --> 20:15.044
Thank you!

20:15.044 --> 20:16.246
(cheers and applause)

20:20.219 --> 20:21.391
Please keep watching, everybody.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.192
We promise
we won't let you down

20:23.192 --> 20:25.395
by what's in store next.

20:25.395 --> 20:26.926
We love you!

20:26.926 --> 20:27.957
Give it up for the cast!

20:27.957 --> 20:30.029
Come here with me. Come on.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.200
(cheers and applause)

20:42.372 --> 20:44.243
Ladies and gentlemen,
One-Take Whitley.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.045
Uh-- (burps)
'Scuse me.

20:47.076 --> 20:48.247
-(coughs)
-(laughs)

20:48.247 --> 20:50.119
Distracting, huh?

20:51.421 --> 20:54.083
-Lock it up, Kym!
-I got this. Let me do it.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.385
You just bend down
and get into it.

20:56.386 --> 20:58.388
-(chortles)
-That's what she said.

20:58.388 --> 20:59.929
(grunts)

21:02.091 --> 21:04.163
-Um...
-You're making a lot
of horse noises.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.164
I know!

21:06.466 --> 21:09.098
Kym: So-- so uncomfortable.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.102
(indistinct)

21:13.102 --> 21:14.203
Mm...

21:14.203 --> 21:15.274
(both laugh)

21:15.274 --> 21:17.307
No problem. (snorts)

21:17.307 --> 21:19.108
(sputters)
Sorry.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.983
-You know what?
-(both laugh)

21:23.983 --> 21:25.114
Just go home.

21:25.114 --> 21:26.986
All right, that's
a wrap, everybody!
