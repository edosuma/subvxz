WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:05.629
You know what Cass did.

00:05.797 --> 00:09.383
The dam inside your brother's head
is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.

00:11.928 --> 00:14.805
Every time I close my eyes,
Lucifer is yelling into my head.

00:14.973 --> 00:18.308
Good morning, Vietnam!

00:18.476 --> 00:19.977
You know he's not actually...

00:20.145 --> 00:23.564
No, I know that, heh, try telling that
to the volume control inside my brain.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.315
Well, did you try the hand thing?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.860
- Big brother is probably dead.
- Shut up.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.611
He said shut up to me.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.157
You let me in. You wanted me, partner.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.159
I do believe I've got you, bunk buddy.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.621
No nap for you, Sammy.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.771
Hey! Dick!

01:04.272 --> 01:05.355
Thattaboy.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.699
No, I...

01:19.829 --> 01:22.039
Dude. Get the hell away from me.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.833
You speak frigging English? Go away.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.252
It's okay. No one's after me.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.048
- Why you running up in here like that?
- Just... Just leave me alone.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.303
- What the hell did you take, anyway?
- Ah.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.222
- Nothing.
- Shut up.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.724
No, no, no, he's telling the truth.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.061
Burned through that last beer hours ago.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.815
Right about the time Dean passed out.
Come on, Sam, tell the nice tweaker.

01:48.983 --> 01:52.778
You'd be sleeping now if the devil
would leave you alone for five seconds.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.655
Stupid Satan.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.533
Chasing you all the way to...

01:57.826 --> 02:00.202
- Where the hell are we?
- Ugh.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.121
I just need some rest.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.747
Hey. Sam.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.792
- Try the hand scar.
- Ugh.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.127
- How many days you been up, anyway?
- Four.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.797
Oh, wait. Scratch that.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.799
Five.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.177
Hey, hold up. Wait. Whoa, hold up.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.764
Wanna knock out? I can knock you out.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.504
Good morning to you

02:52.672 --> 02:54.298
Good morning to you

02:54.465 --> 03:00.012
Our day is beginning
So good morning to you

03:00.180 --> 03:02.556
I thought you liked my singing.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.349
Pills?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.936
You do get that you're just bringing
free drugs to the party, right?

03:08.104 --> 03:10.272
I am inside you, Sam.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.607
Hey, Sam.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.987
What's the longest a normal human
being has ever gone without sleep?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.323
Eleven days, heh.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.700
Hey...

03:21.868 --> 03:23.702
...you always wanted to be normal, Sam.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.664
If you are, you'll be dead in a week!

03:43.514 --> 03:46.308
- You can't walk in.
- You Kadinsky?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.560
- You need to schedule.
- Then schedule me.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.230
He was in a car crash.
Why the hell can't I see him?

03:51.397 --> 03:53.565
- You're Sam Smith's brother.
- What's going on?

03:54.108 --> 03:57.611
Uh, it's fine. Thank you. Really.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.115
Sam was admitted.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.077
He was treated for a broken rib
and lacerations.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.871
- Okay. That's not too bad. And?
- And...

04:09.123 --> 04:11.333
...he's on our locked psychiatric floor.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.923
- I mean, he's had some trouble...
- So you're aware Sam is experiencing...

04:18.091 --> 04:19.548
...a psychotic episode?

04:19.716 --> 04:21.218
Psychotic?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.345
Come on. I mean, the guy is...

04:23.513 --> 04:25.764
It's not like the guy
is freaking Norman Bates.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.140
I'm sure he isn't.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.518
Need to determine whether his state...

04:29.686 --> 04:33.522
...was brought on by the insomnia
or whether the insomnia is a symptom.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.565
So we can figure out how to treat him.

04:35.733 --> 04:39.528
Well, all I can say is that the,
uh, sleep thing is kind of new.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.489
Right.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.118
Well, we've pumped him
about as full of sedatives...

04:46.286 --> 04:49.121
...as we safely can.
So far, he won't go under.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.164
I've never seen anything like it.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.966
I'm just saying.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.968
Back when you had no soul...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.095
...you never had to sleep.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.351
Ah, Mr. Helpless.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.603
Pull up a six-pack, buddy.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.230
How are you feeling?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.149
Maybe you should cancel my UFC fight.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.236
Yeah. Keep that sense of humor, Sam.
It will get you through this.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.077
- Sam, I'm gonna find you help.
- Heh.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.581
Now, that sounded a little cynical.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.292
- I don't think it's out there.
- We don't know that.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.461
We know better than most.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.256
It's all snake oil.
Last faith healer we hooked up with...

05:41.424 --> 05:43.925
...had a reaper on a leash. Remember?

05:45.553 --> 05:47.971
Yeah, Sam, I remember.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.809
- I'm just saying...
- What?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.312
- That you don't want my help?
- Ah, no, I'm just saying...

05:56.814 --> 05:59.649
...don't do this to yourself.
If I don't find something...

05:59.817 --> 06:01.109
Then I'll die.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.402
You're upsetting me.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.321
- Dean, we knew this was coming.
- No.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.281
- When you put my soul back...
- No.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.409
...Cass warned you about all the crap...
Screw Cass.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.913
Quit being Dalai fricking Yoda
about this, okay?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.040
Get pissed.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.709
Ah, I'm too tired.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.130
This is what happens
when you throw a soul...

06:22.298 --> 06:24.174
...into Lucifer's dog bowl.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.803
I mean, you think there's just gonna be
some cure out there?

06:32.809 --> 06:36.061
Oh, you guys are having a moment.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.487
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.
I'm looking for some info.

06:45.655 --> 06:50.867
If you could, uh, call me back,
785-555-0128.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.536
Thanks.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.383
I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.928
Narcissistic personality disorder.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.764
Okay, now, this one I could have.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.102
Time for meds, Sam.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.690
"Sets unrealistic goals." Check.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.734
But "trouble keeping
healthy relationship"?

07:24.902 --> 07:27.904
Hmm...
Not so sure about that one. Thoughts?

07:34.495 --> 07:36.204
Yeah. Thanks.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.276
Yeah, hi, uh, my name is Dean.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.821
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.
I'm, uh, looking for some info.

08:09.989 --> 08:14.451
If you could call me back at 785-555-0128.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.119
Thanks.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.917
Sam, how we feeling today?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.836
Rib pain, scale of one to 10?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.130
It's not bad. Um, ahem.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.132
Three?

08:30.801 --> 08:33.303
You don't have to lie, Sam.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.390
- I'm not.
- You've suffered terrible agony.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.809
I mean, your 10 must be astronomical.

08:40.977 --> 08:43.270
Yeah. Uh, I guess I have a high threshold.

08:43.438 --> 08:47.901
Yeah. But the worst is knowing
that there's always a new 10.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.571
What are you talking about?

08:51.739 --> 08:55.659
Well, I'm talking
about the truly elegant torture...

08:55.826 --> 08:59.788
...I have prepared for you today, Sam.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.211
Just stay the hell away from me.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.047
But it's so nice chatting.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.633
Sam, I hate these
one-sided conversations.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.885
Come on, buddy. Engage.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.930
Sam?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.724
You, me...

09:19.892 --> 09:21.601
...locked ward.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.688
Is it me or is this just like the cage?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.441
- This is Dean.
- Mackey. Calling you back.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.235
Hey. Real sorry about Bobby.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.946
- Yeah. Me too.
- Look, what you called about...

10:15.531 --> 10:17.741
...I might have something for you.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.410
There's this guy. Goes by Emanuel.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.412
Kind of roams.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.206
First started hearing about him
a couple months back...

10:25.374 --> 10:27.834
...how he was healing the sick,
curing the crazy.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.044
Uh-huh.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.546
Naturally I think something in the milk
ain't clean.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.966
- Find this sucker, punch his clock, right?
- Right.

10:35.134 --> 10:39.846
Heard the best way to get to him is
through his wife, Daphne, in Colorado.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.098
So I go...

10:42.266 --> 10:44.225
...tell her I'm going blind.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.020
It's true. My right eye is burnt out.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.689
She says go home, he'll come.

10:49.857 --> 10:55.195
So I go.
I set every trap, every test in the book.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.114
- That's what I would have done.
- Emanuel shows.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.033
He passes every one.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.203
There ain't nothing weird about this guy.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.247
Except he's the real deal.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.707
What do you mean?

11:08.292 --> 11:11.961
He touched me and my eye was fixed.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.674
Look. I don't believe in much
that don't suck your blood...

11:16.926 --> 11:18.927
...but I wouldn't call you on a maybe.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.974
Oh, my head hurts. Please stop!

11:25.685 --> 11:27.268
Hello?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.854
You want this or not?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.524
I saw you yesterday.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.943
You didn't look happy
with your in-flight meal.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.237
Thanks, uh...

11:37.405 --> 11:38.822
Marin. No problem.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.491
- Sam. Right?
- That's it.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.161
I'm Sam.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.208
I'm Sam. Hi.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.514
Hi. Uh, is this Daphne Allen's house?
I'm looking for Emanuel.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.099
Well, you found him.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.562
- Daphne is resting. If you don't mind.
- Oh, sure. Yeah, sure.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.690
Um, ahem.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.233
So...

12:15.568 --> 12:17.444
...I was hoping, uh...

12:28.164 --> 12:29.706
You were saying, Dean?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.167
You know, I'd think twice.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.336
Or don't you know that your boss
issued a hands-off memo?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.757
Please. What have you done
for him lately?

12:39.341 --> 12:42.218
Roman's head on a plate? No?

12:42.386 --> 12:44.888
Whatever Emanuel is,
Crowley is gonna want him.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.931
A lot more than he wants you
these days.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.517
So...

13:09.121 --> 13:10.413
What was that?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.881
Did that creature hurt you?

13:21.675 --> 13:23.384
I'm okay.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.557
But, Emanuel, they were looking for you.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.559
It's okay.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.234
I'm Emanuel.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.989
- Dean. I'm Dean.
- Thank you for protecting my wife.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.784
Your wife. Right.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.494
I saw his face.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.704
His real face.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.373
He was a demon?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.794
A demon walked the earth.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.130
Demons. Whack-loads of them.
You don't know about...?

14:05.052 --> 14:07.345
You saw the demon's true face.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.307
Emanuel has very special gifts.

14:11.475 --> 14:15.520
Yeah, I've heard that about, uh, Emanuel.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.355
That you can heal people up.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.984
I seem to be able to help
to a certain degree.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.652
What's your issue?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.115
My brother.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.296
Wake up, little Susie Wake up

14:45.217 --> 14:48.136
You're actually keeping it together
better than I thought.

14:48.304 --> 14:52.307
Kind of the way someone
pinned under a bus keeps it together.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.808
None of this is real.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.186
And yet, you know what really sucks?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.356
It doesn't matter.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.360
Because I won.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.655
Your madness won. I mean, look at you.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.450
It's hard to believe you were the guy
that saved the world once.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.873
Hmm, Sammy. What will it be today?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.291
Maggots again...

15:18.459 --> 15:20.001
...or, uh, tapeworm?

15:20.544 --> 15:22.879
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.464
How you doing?

15:25.424 --> 15:28.468
Uh, little better.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.970
That girl, uh, Marin...

15:31.138 --> 15:33.681
Look, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

15:33.849 --> 15:37.435
Let's just say, unlike you,
she didn't get here because of no accident.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.151
Hmm.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.206
So Daphne.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.792
That, uh, your wife?

16:02.127 --> 16:03.711
She found me and cared for me.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.588
Meaning?

16:06.715 --> 16:09.050
Oh, it's a strange story.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.178
- You may not like it.
- Believe me, I will.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.017
A few months ago,
she was hiking by the river...

16:18.185 --> 16:20.603
...and I wandered into her path...

16:20.771 --> 16:23.481
...drenched and confused...

16:24.566 --> 16:25.650
...and unclothed.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.194
I had no memory.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.657
She said God wanted her to find me.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.621
So who named you Emanuel?

16:39.623 --> 16:42.375
Bouncybabynames. Com.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.587
Well, it's working for you.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.133
Must be weird not knowing who you are.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.720
Well, it's my life. And it's a good life.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.597
Yeah, well,
what if you were some kind of...

16:56.765 --> 16:59.559
...I don't know, bad guy?

17:00.269 --> 17:04.313
I don't feel like a bad person.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.911
Man, you must be really
determined to wait out nap time.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.372
Here.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.790
Wait. Uh...

17:24.001 --> 17:25.501
Share this with me, heh.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.253
Thanks.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.883
I don't know why I'm thanking you
for a candy bar I stole.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.603
- So how long you been here?
- Five weeks and counting.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.854
Going for the record.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.192
- How come?
- Doesn't matter.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.527
A lot of bandages for "it doesn't matter."

17:51.695 --> 17:53.613
You want the doctor answer?

17:53.781 --> 17:56.908
I'm psychotically depressed
with suicidal ideation.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.286
And the not-doctor answer?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.664
I feel like crap.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.876
I just want it to be over.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.961
What?

18:10.547 --> 18:12.090
Everything.

18:13.133 --> 18:17.095
Go on. Tell me I'm young
and have everything to live for.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.890
Why would you believe me?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.017
True.

18:24.269 --> 18:29.315
I heard you're here
because the voices won't let you sleep.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.276
Uh, just one, really, heh.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.653
Who is it?

18:33.821 --> 18:36.447
Like Charlie Manson or the devil?

18:39.576 --> 18:40.701
Kind of. Yeah.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.746
Me too.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.791
I hear a voice.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.878
Is that why you set the fire?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.924
- Who told you that?
- No one. They're burns, right?

18:55.092 --> 18:58.094
I didn't set the fire... He did.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.014
- I don't know why I'm talking to you.
- It's okay.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.808
No, it's not.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.852
You are crazier than I am.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.062
Charles Manson tells you what to do.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.439
At least it's my own brother...

19:11.859 --> 19:14.193
- It's your brother?
- Yes.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.781
It sucks...

19:18.949 --> 19:23.452
...when it's your dead brother
saying kill yourself to be with him...

19:24.913 --> 19:26.706
...or he'll do it for you.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.837
So your brother...

19:33.463 --> 19:35.381
- Sam.
- Sam.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.718
What's his diagnosis?

19:39.428 --> 19:43.264
Well, ahem, it's not exactly medical.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.768
That should be fine.
I can cure illness of a spiritual origin.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.645
Spiritual?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.355
Okay.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.692
Someone did this to him.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.158
- You're angry.
- Yeah. Dude broke my brother's head.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.660
He betrayed you, this dude.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.413
He was your friend?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.709
Yeah, well, he's gone.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.002
Did you kill him?

20:14.963 --> 20:17.882
I sense that you kill a lot of people.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.968
Honestly, I don't know if he is dead.

20:24.097 --> 20:28.392
I just know that this whole thing
couldn't be messier.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.812
You know, I used to be able
to just shake this stuff off.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.690
You know, whatever it was.
Might take me some time...

20:35.817 --> 20:36.901
...but I always could.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.740
What Cass did...

20:43.951 --> 20:46.994
...I just can't. I don't know why.
It doesn't matter why.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.454
- Of course it matters.
- No.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.874
You're not a machine, Dean.
You're human.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.711
Your friend's name was Cass?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.215
That's an odd name.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.443
Oh, hey, hey. Just, uh, sit tight.
I'll be right out, okay?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.935
Come on.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.192
Oh.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.050
Emanuel, you son of a bitch.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.260
Emanuel.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.137
Yeah, not so much.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.352
- Meg.
- Dean, Dean, Dean.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.437
You got some explaining to do.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.830
Rumors are really starting to fly
about this Emanuel fellow.

22:54.998 --> 22:58.376
- My curiosity sure got revved up.
- Just tell me what you want.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.046
Imagine my surprise when I track him
down and he's snuggled up with you.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.591
And he's the spitting image
of poor dead Castiel.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.969
So Dean, what's poor dead Castiel
doing in that junker out there?

23:09.137 --> 23:10.888
Christmas caroling.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.475
Fun. But how's he alive?
Last I heard, he played God, went poof.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.604
I don't know. And neither does he,
so you gotta keep it shut.

23:18.772 --> 23:22.233
- Oh, I do?
- He doesn't know he's Cass.

23:22.401 --> 23:26.862
I know. Been watching you for hours.
So here's the deal.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.157
You might remember Crowley and me
were frosty back in the day?

23:30.325 --> 23:32.576
- Well, times haven't changed.
- Good.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.371
That hurts my feelings.
I've been good to you, Dean.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.957
No, you've been good to you, sweetheart.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.752
Look. Right now,
rumors of this wandering healer...

23:41.920 --> 23:45.756
...are strictly low-level. But body count
is getting high enough to change that.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.342
Folks start poking, they sniff angel dust.

23:48.510 --> 23:52.221
Yeah, and they start falling all over
each other trying to tell Crowley.

23:52.389 --> 23:57.101
Now, picture Crowley with his hands
on harmless little amnesia Cass.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.895
Don't get me wrong,
I'm gonna burn that smarmy dick.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.147
My time is coming.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.899
But right about now,
my army-of-one situation...

24:04.067 --> 24:05.151
...is not cutting it.

24:05.318 --> 24:08.696
It's cold out here, there's a price
on my ass and I need friends.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.031
Yeah. I get that.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.283
But I ain't it.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.285
That's where you're wrong, Dean.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.496
Because I'm here to help you,
and that makes us friends.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.832
Help, huh?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.960
You mean see if you can't turn
harmless Cass out there...

24:23.128 --> 24:24.587
...into an angel-sized weapon?

24:24.754 --> 24:27.047
Like you're taking him caroling.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.384
And by the way, you really wanna
keep going with no backup?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.803
Hey, I don't trust you either.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.181
But I could really use Emanuel.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.515
And he trusts you.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.852
For now, it's in everyone's best interest
to hold hands...

24:40.020 --> 24:41.812
...cross the street together, okay?

24:43.940 --> 24:46.650
We go straight to Sam. No detours.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.902
Love it.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.030
And one more thing.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.991
My knife.

24:58.246 --> 25:02.166
You sure we wouldn't be safer
traveling with a full-throttle angel?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.919
I could jog his memory.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.924
Kidding. We wouldn't wanna
upset the poor guy.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.225
- Her face. She's one of...
- It's okay. We come in different flavors.

25:19.392 --> 25:22.102
She's, uh, a friend.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.649
Meg. Just here for moral support.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.151
I mean, after all, we go way back.

25:30.779 --> 25:34.490
Dean and me. Just met you,
heh, of course.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.203
But I think
we're gonna be good friends too.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.998
All right, can we go?

25:47.212 --> 25:50.005
Marin. Marin, hey, uh, hold on.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.180
Look, um...

25:58.348 --> 26:00.724
...I'm sorry I upset you.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.351
It's okay.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.979
Can I ask you something?

26:05.438 --> 26:07.022
About?

26:07.857 --> 26:09.650
- The fire.
- Look, you mean well...

26:09.818 --> 26:12.528
...but you have no idea...
You said you didn't start it.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.196
I believe you.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.450
I can help you, Marin,
before he tries to hurt you again.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.836
You're worse.
Your organs need sleep, you know.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.673
Your hair and nails are gonna fall out,
your kidneys are gonna shut down.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.924
I saw it in a movie.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.094
Sorry.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.267
So, um, your brother...

26:43.435 --> 26:46.186
...when did he pass?
Uh...

26:46.354 --> 26:47.438
Last year.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.897
And you see him?

26:51.818 --> 26:55.237
So he just talks to you.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.536
I bet at first, it wasn't so bad.
You must've missed him.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.873
- Did you just hear him at the house or...?
- Here too.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.541
Whenever I'm alone.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.045
I can always tell he's coming
because I get these chills.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.130
- You feel cold.
- Yeah.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.800
I mean, you're right.

27:17.427 --> 27:23.682
At first, it's like I knew I was crazy,
but I didn't really care.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.976
I did miss him.

27:27.937 --> 27:33.067
But then he started saying he was lonely.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.071
And he started to get mad.
And one day he started yelling...

27:37.238 --> 27:39.490
...and I tried to run,
but the door was locked.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.743
And when I turned around,
the whole room was on fire.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.954
I barely got out.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.085
How can you help me?

27:52.128 --> 27:53.921
I can put your brother to rest.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.507
He's, uh...

27:58.093 --> 28:00.094
He's stuck here.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.681
- For real? Like...
- Like he is a ghost.

28:05.475 --> 28:09.103
- Why should I trust you?
- Because it's your only shot.

28:12.816 --> 28:16.235
Okay.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.738
So your brother, was he cremated?
Buried?

28:19.906 --> 28:22.700
- We cremated him.
- And do you have anything of his?

28:26.037 --> 28:28.122
This. He made it for me.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.582
And with a busted hand too.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.043
Sliced it open doing stupid archery.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.379
He bled on it?

28:35.588 --> 28:37.881
- Probably.
- Good. That's good.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.050
- Why is that good?
- One more question:

28:40.218 --> 28:43.512
Is there any chance in hell
you got a lighter?

28:56.109 --> 28:59.820
This silence is very uncomfortable.
Is there something I should know?

29:00.447 --> 29:02.906
I don't know. Dean?

29:03.074 --> 29:04.616
No.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.577
Meg has that effect.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.204
Awkward, you know?

29:09.372 --> 29:11.081
That must be difficult for you.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.835
Dean's making a joke, Emanuel.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.630
Oh, heh.

29:25.805 --> 29:29.016
- Nice. Where did you score that?
- Grabbed it out of Marcus' pocket.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.894
Being locked up is turning me
into a decent criminal.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.900
We're laying down a circle.
Help me open these, okay?

29:52.248 --> 29:54.625
You're gonna have to do this
on your own.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.336
- I'm okay. Just having a little, uh...
- Brown acid moment?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.671
Dizzy thing. It will pass.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.299
Definitely. When your heart stops.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.012
Great.
Now, um, stay with me in the circle.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.139
No matter what happens, okay?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.642
- What's gonna happen?
- Give me the bracelet.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.905
Marin, don't do this. Please.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.156
Give me the bracelet.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.658
I'm so sorry. I have to.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.223
You gotta go. Go.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.143
Thank you.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.817
Come on.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.783
Sam? How are you feeling now?

31:09.993 --> 31:11.827
His soul is broken, doc.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.162
- Give him a pill?
- Can't give more medication.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.833
The potential for overdose is too great.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.294
We need to talk about surgical solutions.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.088
- Surgical?
- Ooh, lobotomy?

31:23.256 --> 31:25.007
We're not talking lobotomy here.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.925
Darn.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.468
Sam?

31:28.636 --> 31:30.137
Are you with me?

31:31.014 --> 31:32.598
Sam?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.404
Oh, gracious.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.698
Damn it. Demons.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.785
- All of them?
- No grass growing under your feet.

31:54.954 --> 31:57.205
How many of those knives do you have?

31:57.373 --> 31:58.749
Just the one.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.335
Well, then, forgive me,
but what do we do?

32:01.502 --> 32:05.047
Yeah, Dean. Got any other ideas
how we could blast through that?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.302
Excuse us. Meg?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.846
Oh, for the love of...

32:13.556 --> 32:18.518
Sam is in there. I know you're enjoying
the double dip with your old pal, but...

32:18.686 --> 32:21.563
You think it's that cut-and-dry? Really?

32:22.315 --> 32:26.652
You know what he did. You wanna tell
him and just hope he takes it in stride?

32:26.819 --> 32:29.988
He could snap. He could disappear.
Who knows?

32:30.156 --> 32:31.740
I gather we know each other.

32:33.743 --> 32:34.826
Just a dollop.

32:36.245 --> 32:39.164
- You can tell me and I'll be fine.
- How do you know?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.833
You just met you.
I've known you for years.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.211
You're an angel.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.214
Uh, I'm sorry? Is that a flirtation?

32:47.382 --> 32:51.593
No, it's a species. A very powerful one.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.095
She's not lying.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.555
Okay? That's why you heal people.

32:55.723 --> 32:56.890
You don't eat.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.518
I'm sure there's more.

33:01.104 --> 33:04.898
Why wouldn't you tell me?
Being an angel, it sounds pleasant.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.817
It's not, trust me.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.610
It's bloody, it's corrupt.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.862
It's not pleasant.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.533
He would know.
You used to fight together.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.326
Bestest friends, actually.

33:17.453 --> 33:18.662
We're friends?

33:22.417 --> 33:23.834
Am I Cass?

33:27.588 --> 33:30.090
I had no idea.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.509
I don't remember you. I'm sorry.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.261
Look, you got the juice.

33:34.762 --> 33:38.598
You can smite every demon in that lot.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.734
But I don't remember how.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.488
It's in there.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.491
I'm sure it's just like riding a bike.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.537
I don't know how to do that either.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.712
All right, I'll try.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.594
This ain't gonna go well.

34:15.803 --> 34:20.306
I don't know.
I believe in the little tree topper.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.650
Hey, I know you.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.862
- You're dead.
- Yes, I've heard.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.716
I'm sorry, Dean.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.641
That's my boy.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.397
I don't think running will save you.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.745
That was beautiful, Clarence.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.289
Cass?

35:28.835 --> 35:31.002
I remember you.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.760
I remember everything.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.147
What I did...

35:50.398 --> 35:52.274
...what I became...

35:53.067 --> 35:56.027
...why didn't you tell me?
Because Sam is dying in there.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.445
Because of me.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.489
Everything.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.116
All these people.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.744
- I shouldn't be here.
- Cass. Cass!

36:04.912 --> 36:06.079
You stay here.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.873
Cass!

36:25.433 --> 36:27.309
Whoa, where are we?

36:27.476 --> 36:30.020
Electroshock therapy.
Let's just get you settled.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.355
Don't be freaked.
I've seen this help a lot of people.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.232
Unh! Uh...

36:34.400 --> 36:36.109
- My brother.
- Bite down.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.825
Ordinarily,
they keep this thing set on low.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.828
But I was thinking
we could experiment a little.

36:47.830 --> 36:48.914
What do you say, Sam?

36:50.249 --> 36:52.500
Let's get that head strapped in.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.259
You remember, then you know
you did the best you could at the time.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.136
Don't defend me.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.597
Do you have any idea the death toll
in heaven?

37:05.765 --> 37:07.682
On Earth?

37:09.018 --> 37:11.186
We didn't part friends, Dean.

37:12.855 --> 37:15.190
- So what?
- I deserved to die.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.861
Now, I can't possibly fix it...

37:20.529 --> 37:22.614
...so why did I even walk
out of that river?

37:25.743 --> 37:26.868
Maybe to fix it.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.664
Wait.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.144
Amazing. You just take those lickings,
don't you, kid?

37:53.646 --> 37:57.691
Well, if it's meat, you can cook it.
Just gotta turn up the heat.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.956
I should never have broken your wall,
Sam.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.084
I'm here to make it right.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.427
You're not real.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.682
Oh, Sam.

38:32.727 --> 38:33.810
I'm so sorry.

38:39.775 --> 38:42.152
I see that third little pig was smart.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.448
- Went out and got bricks.
- What do you mean you can't?

38:46.615 --> 38:48.992
I mean, there's nothing left to rebuild.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.369
Why not?

38:51.537 --> 38:54.831
Because it crumbled.
The pieces got crushed to dust...

38:54.999 --> 38:58.126
...by whatever is happening
inside his head right now.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.298
So you're saying there's nothing?

39:03.466 --> 39:05.717
Gonna be like this
until his candle blows out?

39:06.302 --> 39:07.927
I'm sorry.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.597
This isn't a problem
I can make disappear.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.641
You know that.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.816
But I may be able to shift it.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.780
- Shift?
- It would get Sam back on his feet.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.536
It's better this way.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.581
I'll be fine.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.794
- Cass, what are you doing?
- Now, Sam, this may hurt.

39:42.004 --> 39:44.214
And if I can't tell you again...

39:44.673 --> 39:46.424
...I'm sorry I ever did this to you.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.526
Sam?

40:04.693 --> 40:06.486
- Dean.
- Sam!

40:06.737 --> 40:09.656
Cass? Cass, is that you?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.953
Hello, brother.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.390
I don't know.
I mean, we can't just leave him.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.893
Can't bring him with us. Everything
on the planet is out for us, okay?

40:39.061 --> 40:41.813
Word gets out, we can't protect him.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.565
Not really.

40:43.732 --> 40:46.860
This is safer. Every demon
who knows about Cass is dead.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.945
Not every one. Look, Dean...

40:49.113 --> 40:52.449
...this enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend
thing feels like a demon deal.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.576
- It's not a deal. It's...
- It's what?

40:57.204 --> 40:59.205
Mutually assured destruction.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.792
Look, man, I get it, she's not our friend.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.503
We don't even have friends.
All our friends are dead.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.638
Well, you certainly have experience.
Uh, I'm impressed.

41:16.515 --> 41:20.894
Tell me,
why do you want to join our staff?

41:21.979 --> 41:24.564
I really just wanna help the patients.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.357
Watch over them.

41:26.525 --> 41:30.069
Not to be immodest,
but I feel like I'd make a great fit.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.281
I can't argue with that.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.493
Welcome to the team...

41:36.660 --> 41:38.119
...Nurse Masters.
