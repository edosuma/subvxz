10:32.023 --> 10:33.690
(gasps) You're alive?

10:33.708 --> 10:36.876
Lisa, how can you just--
I don't know-- play

10:37.028 --> 10:39.529
as the world
is collapsing around us?

10:39.547 --> 10:41.865
How are you talking to me?
(chuckles weakly)

10:41.958 --> 10:44.884
How do you know
about the lockdown?

10:45.036 --> 10:47.053
Lisa, we may be born to shop,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.389
but we're not, like, unaware.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.707
No, of course, but...

10:50.725 --> 10:53.376
It's just so hard
to feel present right now,

10:53.378 --> 10:56.971
isn't it? Not when
those things are out there.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.824
Can we not talk about
the caterpillars?

10:59.976 --> 11:01.993
This is the first time
in two days

11:02.145 --> 11:04.311
I've been free
of crushing anxiety and...

11:04.406 --> 11:06.072
Oh, my God, the caterpillars

11:06.166 --> 11:08.224
have caused a lettuce shortage.

11:08.317 --> 11:12.003
Rioters were tear-gassed
at a Whole Foods salad bar.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.488
That's so sad.

11:14.582 --> 11:15.915
I'm just gonna say it.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.842
I think this is the new normal.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.903
(whimpering)
Oh. Oh, no.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.304
Oh, no.

11:23.425 --> 11:24.665
Look, Maggie.

11:24.759 --> 11:27.835
Daddy's got delicious
ranch dressing right here.

11:27.929 --> 11:30.671

11:30.765 --> 11:32.565

11:33.768 --> 11:37.362

Great Daddy.

11:54.197 --> 11:55.880
Tonight, we're breaking
into Ned's basement

11:56.032 --> 11:57.698
and cleaning that sucker out.

11:57.792 --> 11:58.717
Babe?

11:58.793 --> 12:00.969
Get the bolt cutters.

12:06.968 --> 12:10.954
<i> Mother, how can you give my</i>

12:11.122 --> 12:13.047
Agnes, I'll treasure the quilt

12:13.066 --> 12:14.807
like it deserves
to be treasured.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.477
Like you deserve
to be treasured.

12:17.629 --> 12:19.053
Oh, you.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.314
(laughs, snorts)

12:21.466 --> 12:24.075
Let me fix you
another liverwurst melt.

12:24.227 --> 12:26.244
Great. That's just great.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.415
Mm...

12:35.905 --> 12:37.313
Oh, my God.

12:37.482 --> 12:40.592
That quilt was baby Skinner's
security blanket.

Skinner's crying?

12:48.602 --> 12:49.917
Can he do that?

12:50.011 --> 12:52.086
That quilt was his blankie.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.271
You don't... (sniffs)

12:53.348 --> 12:55.498
you don't take away
a man's blankie!

12:55.517 --> 12:57.925
Make Mr. Purple Shirt
stop crying

12:57.944 --> 12:59.277
so he can sit at his desk

12:59.428 --> 13:01.929
and tell recess to happen.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.764
No, guys.
We're not doing this.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.099
We're not feeling bad
for Skinner.

13:05.176 --> 13:07.452
We're not gonna see him
as a human being.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.776
I can't believe I'm saying this.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.036
We're gonna help our principal

13:17.130 --> 13:19.631
get his blankie back.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.969
So, anybody feel like
doing some shopping?

13:25.196 --> 13:26.379
(chuckles weakly)

13:26.531 --> 13:27.972
No time, Lisa.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.456
We're building a barricade

13:29.551 --> 13:32.126
in case the caterpillars
get inside.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.979
That does look really safe.

13:35.206 --> 13:37.732
Kind of wish I was
