12:02.291 --> 12:03.666
(Rollo chuckles)

12:03.750 --> 12:05.166
What are you doing?

12:05.250 --> 12:08.125
Knocking is, uh...
is customary, uh, Birdy,

12:08.208 --> 12:11.416
although, I admit, maybe not
in the public houses that you frequent.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.916
Public... I've never been
to a public house. Mama, he lies.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.875
-ROLLO: I'm not lying, darling!
- AISLINN: Oh...

12:16.958 --> 12:19.458
-I'm jesting. There's a difference.
-(Aislinn laughing)

12:19.541 --> 12:22.625
Although I did see you in the, uh,
public house the other night, didn't I?

12:22.708 --> 12:26.833
Um, swearing and drinking ale,
getting into fights with peasants?

12:26.916 --> 12:28.583
-Big punch-up, no? Huh?
-Mama?

12:28.666 --> 12:31.666
AISLINN: I, for one, should like
my room free of jesters for the moment.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.083
I should like to rest.

12:33.166 --> 12:35.916
ROLLO:
One more jest before I go, huh?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.458
What did the Pope say to the ale rat?

12:41.166 --> 12:43.041
-(Rollo chuckling)
-BIRDY: What?

12:43.125 --> 12:44.333
What?

12:44.416 --> 12:45.875
Well, what did the Pope say
to the ale rat?

12:45.958 --> 12:48.041
What did the Pope say to the...
What are you talking about?

12:48.125 --> 12:50.625
-BIRDY: The jest.
-She gone... she gone mad?

12:50.708 --> 12:52.125
The Pope and the ale rat.

12:52.208 --> 12:53.583
What Pope?

12:53.666 --> 12:55.541
-Which ale rat?
-Father...

12:55.625 --> 12:57.375
Oh, yes. Um...

12:58.375 --> 13:00.250
(laughs)

13:00.333 --> 13:02.541

-Mama?

13:02.625 --> 13:04.000
Birdy.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.791
I have something to tell you.
It's ever so serious, so...

13:06.875 --> 13:08.458
(whimpers, groans)

13:08.541 --> 13:10.916
-Mama, are you all right?
-(shudders) Yes.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.708
It's just the baby kicking.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.750
What was it you wanted to say, darling?

13:14.833 --> 13:16.916
BIRDY:
Maybe now is not a good time.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.708
And perhaps I shall wait forever.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.750
-There's a hanging today in Rutherford.
-A hanging?

13:21.833 --> 13:23.875
An ever so small one.
I was thinking I could maybe go...

13:23.958 --> 13:25.500
Absolutely forbidden.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.000
-Robert goes to all the hangings.
-Well, Robert is Robert, and you are not.

13:28.083 --> 13:32.000
And anyhow, the Sidebottoms arrive today.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.166
It's your favorite day of the month.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.750
Come here to me, child.

13:35.833 --> 13:39.708
Come and rest with your weary mother.

13:39.791 --> 13:45.541
(sighs)
So nice to have you here, my darling.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.166
I'm so tired.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.083
I'm always so tired.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.208
When will I not be tired, Birdy?

13:51.291 --> 13:53.166
BIRDY:
Um, in a year?

-It's so ducky.
-Birdy?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.666
You must give me some kind of warning,

14:46.750 --> 14:50.500
because the sight of your countenance,
it makes me...

14:50.583 --> 14:52.666
it makes me feel... (retches)

14:55.583 --> 14:57.083
Hi, Robert.

ROBERT:
Lady Sidebottom.

Aelis.

Always very good to see you.

You're looking rather piquant.

Well, you look rather pink yourself.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.625
Leave us be.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.666
Do you ladies need an escort
around the garden?

15:11.750 --> 15:14.500
It's... it-it can be very dangerous
around here.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.416
-Just go, you deathmonger. Go!
-(chuckles)

15:17.500 --> 15:19.333
And the roses have, um...

15:19.416 --> 15:21.125
-been exceptional this season.
-Absolutely wonderful.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.625
And, of course, butterflies.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.458
I hate butterflies.

15:28.250 --> 15:34.083
We have already had, uh,
five or six marriage proposals,

15:34.166 --> 15:37.416
all of them serious inquiries.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
We've had, um, uh, nine...

15:39.583 --> 15:43.625
Some of these letters are florid
in the extreme.

15:43.708 --> 15:46.875
But I don't care if they are poets.

15:46.958 --> 15:51.375
I care if they can pay

15:51.458 --> 15:54.916

in gold brick.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.250
Absolutely.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.208
-Welcome to Stonebridge, Lady Aelis.
-Oh, you have buns!

16:01.291 --> 16:02.916
Yes, I have buns.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.666
I used to have more buns and cakes,
but now I think we're poor.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.166
-We are not poor,
-Good.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.875
but there's nothing to eat at our manor,

16:08.958 --> 16:10.750
'cause Papa banished the baker
a month ago.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.000
Why?

16:12.083 --> 16:14.583
(whispering):
Well, he said that he and my stepmother

16:14.666 --> 16:17.375
were exchanging wistful glances.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.125
BOTH:
Hmm.

Thank you. Thank you.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.583
My lady, I promise
I'm not spoiling my supper.

16:26.666 --> 16:30.500
Oh. I do not give a goat's ass
what you spoil, Aelis.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.666
LORD SIDEBOTTOM:
Berenice! B-Berenice!

16:32.750 --> 16:36.916
Never again leave a convivial grouping
when I'm speaking.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.416
I... I was about to make
a point of great importance.

16:42.916 --> 16:46.375
Well, I go where I want,

16:46.458 --> 16:50.166
and I say what I please!

16:50.250 --> 16:53.416
(whispers):
She's been writing the most tragic poetry.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.958
(both chuckle)

16:55.041 --> 16:59.833
Do you know my stepmother was brought
to our manor from Gascony?

16:59.916 --> 17:01.208
-Gascony?
-Mm-hmm.

17:01.291 --> 17:04.833
-First by boat, then by carriage.
-Mm-hmm.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.916
Took many nights, and no one told her
where she was going.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And then my father was waiting.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.666
He sent away for a wife
the day after my mother died.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.916
Men are horribly duplicitous creatures.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.375
I should like to take
a carriage with you, Aelis.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.208
How would we escape?

17:25.291 --> 17:30.375
We'll, uh, steal a knight's armor
or a monk's robes or...

17:30.458 --> 17:33.208
-I don't know.
-(laughs) Well, where would we go?

17:33.291 --> 17:35.541
-Well...
-(laughs)

17:35.625 --> 17:37.458
Uncle George writes to me of the Crusades.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.291
-Oh, Uncle George.
-So we could...

17:39.375 --> 17:41.000
Uncle George, Uncle George!

17:41.083 --> 17:43.791
All you ever speak about is Uncle George.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.708
-Yes, because he comes soon, Aelis.
-Mm.

17:45.791 --> 17:47.333
You know he's my best uncle.

17:47.416 --> 17:48.833
He's your only uncle.

As the time approaches when we must wed,

17:57.541 --> 18:00.083
we are forced to undertake lady lessons.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.791
My two least favorite words,
together in one terrible phrase.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.583
Gently, young ladies.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.500
A gentle hand plays a soothing tune.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.375
-for any suitor who may call.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.500
Do we find our lessons ever so funny?

18:17.583 --> 18:19.625
It seems to me a joke is astir.

18:19.708 --> 18:20.916
No.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.125

But she will find she has no easy job.

Why does he get to meet the baby?

19:12.541 --> 19:14.791
Only God will meet this baby, Birdy.

19:14.875 --> 19:18.208
BIRDY: I will never get used
to babies coming dead.

19:18.291 --> 19:22.333
And my heart will never stop aching
for them to live.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.791
I continue to hide my rags
so that my father

19:24.875 --> 19:27.041
will not make me a wife and a mother,

19:27.125 --> 19:31.833
and I will keep hiding them
over and over...

19:31.916 --> 19:33.750

Mother usually checks in on Edward
at the abbey,

19:38.708 --> 19:42.625
but she still loses blood from the birth
so sends me in her place.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.875
Mayhap I could be a saint.

22:57.958 --> 23:02.875

help their nursemaids with the washing.

BIRDY:
Why does Edward want me to read this book

23:07.041 --> 23:09.166

23:09.250 --> 23:12.416

I will never actually meet.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.375
At the very least, I'll become an expert
on their gruesome deaths,

23:15.458 --> 23:19.333
which are so displeasing
that they please me terribly.

23:19.416 --> 23:21.333
What does "defenestration" mean?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.291
-A mission towards glory.
-Ow! Ow!

23:26.375 --> 23:29.375
-I don't want to be a lady,
so perhaps a saint? -Ow! Ow.

23:29.458 --> 23:32.166
Birdy, put some shoes on,
for heaven's sake.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.458
I cannot.

23:33.541 --> 23:36.375

I'm to practice self-sacrifice.

I'm denying myself buns.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.708
I'm also going to sleep
with a comb beneath my back,

23:46.791 --> 23:49.500
for I must emulate Saint Blandina,

23:49.583 --> 23:51.458
who was scourged,
placed on a red-hot grate

23:51.541 --> 23:53.625

with his horns.

Tragically, she was killed with a dagger.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.666

with good humor month after month.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.375

Rollo, why did you not tell me
we have naught to spend?

I want only to be your partner,
to stand beside you as lady of this manor.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.041
Because the lady needs
to have her garlands,

24:33.125 --> 24:36.375
she needs to have her silver twine,
she needs to have apples in her roast,

24:36.458 --> 24:41.166

56:32.208 --> 56:33.916
Will you excuse me for a minute,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.041
Aunt Ethelfritha?

56:36.125 --> 56:38.958
(chuckles)
Of course, little beautiful Bird.

56:39.041 --> 56:41.541
Don't fly the coop.

56:41.625 --> 56:43.541
Try the tart. It's spinach.

56:43.625 --> 56:45.708
-What are you trying to do? You know...
-Just have a nibble.

56:45.791 --> 56:49.250
You know very well I've got
an ulcer the size of a pig's ass.

56:49.333 --> 56:51.375
-It's soft. It's pastry.
-Are you trying to kill me?

56:51.458 --> 56:52.708
Just stop it.

56:52.791 --> 56:55.916
(laughter, applause)

56:56.000 --> 56:58.375
I wish you the same things
you wish for yourself.

56:59.458 --> 57:00.500
What?

57:00.583 --> 57:02.708
(laughs)

57:02.791 --> 57:04.875
I wish you happiness, Aelis.

57:04.958 --> 57:07.791
And I'm so sorry
that I ever said otherwise.

57:07.875 --> 57:10.291
Ever since we quarreled,
I've done nothing but miss you.

57:11.375 --> 57:13.458
And there is so much to tell.

57:13.541 --> 57:16.166
In fact, I have only two words.

57:18.083 --> 57:19.708
(whispers):
Mitten man.

57:22.750 --> 57:24.333
Aelis!

57:24.416 --> 57:26.416
Hey, would you like to see my doll?

57:26.500 --> 57:28.208
He has a turnip for a head.

57:28.291 --> 57:31.250
-And who are you?
-Why, I'm her husband, of course.

57:31.333 --> 57:34.375
-Of course. Of course.
-LORD SIDEBOTTOM: A fine...

57:34.458 --> 57:38.625
fine, handsome husband he is, too, huh?

57:38.708 --> 57:40.833
(laughing)

57:40.916 --> 57:42.916
(lively chatter continues in distance)

57:45.500 --> 57:48.083
Quiet! Quiet!

57:48.166 --> 57:51.708
-Silence! Silence!

58:00.416 --> 58:03.125
You muck-spouting fopdoodles!

58:03.208 --> 58:05.666
(laughs, grunts)

58:05.750 --> 58:07.750
I'm the seventh-richest man in Yorkshire.

58:07.833 --> 58:09.583
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

58:09.666 --> 58:12.000
And I want to fornicate.

58:12.083 --> 58:15.166
-(yells) Come here, you little scrubber.
-Ew!

58:15.250 --> 58:17.250
BIRDY:
Adults call me insolent,

58:17.333 --> 58:20.375
but have they ever met
their own drunken friends? Blech.

58:20.458 --> 58:22.458
-(cheering)
-(clanging)

58:23.541 --> 58:25.458
Come on, come on. Upsy.

58:25.541 --> 58:27.333
There you go.

58:27.416 --> 58:30.291
Do you not love a wedding
with every beat of your heart?

58:30.375 --> 58:32.666
No, I do not.

58:32.750 --> 58:36.625
But it is strange that I should like
the woman who is taking George from us.

58:36.708 --> 58:39.500
Life can be quite a shock, Bird.

58:40.583 --> 58:42.166
MORWENNA:
Goodbye, Georgie.

58:42.250 --> 58:44.875
-(indistinct shouting)
-Bye, George!

58:45.958 --> 58:48.041
(cheering, laughter)

58:48.125 --> 58:50.958
BIRDY:
That vomit was yet another shock.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.166
ROLLO:
Did you have a nice morning, Birdy?

58:55.250 --> 58:56.916
BIRDY:
Perplexingly pleasant.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.166
I like your, uh...

58:59.250 --> 59:01.875
your hair... hair snakes.

59:01.958 --> 59:03.250
(grunts)

59:03.333 --> 59:05.458
BIRDY:
Why does the shaggy-bearded cretin remain?

59:05.541 --> 59:08.125
Uh, Lord Murgaw, did you know
that Catherine here spins

59:08.208 --> 59:11.208
some of the finest yarn in Stonebridge?

59:11.291 --> 59:14.166
I don't care too much about fabric.

59:15.541 --> 59:18.916
I'd dance in the nude
if it were not a sin.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.125
I bloody would.

59:20.208 --> 59:22.625
(laughter)

59:22.708 --> 59:25.375
So, what do you like to... what do you
like to do? Do you like to, um...

59:25.458 --> 59:26.875
What's the thing that-that men do

59:26.958 --> 59:28.875
when they run after the...
with the animal with the...

59:28.958 --> 59:30.958
-With the arrow? Um, hunting.
-AISLINN: Fishing. Fishing, fishing.

59:31.041 --> 59:32.458
-No, no, I know hunting.
-Jousting.

59:32.541 --> 59:34.250
-Uh... it's something that men do.
-AISLINN: Chasing?

59:34.333 --> 59:35.708
-BIRDY: Jousting.
-Climbing trees.

59:35.791 --> 59:37.583
-All right, Robert. No.
-BIRDY: Climb a tree, then piss in it.

59:37.666 --> 59:39.666
So, what-what is it you like to do?

59:39.750 --> 59:42.375
I collect rare lizard skins.

59:43.541 --> 59:45.541
And I do puzzles.

59:45.625 --> 59:48.708
One piece a night,
everything in moderation.

59:49.791 --> 59:50.791
Except for the carnal.

59:50.875 --> 59:52.333
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

59:52.416 --> 59:54.166
(grunts)

59:55.250 --> 59:57.666
-(laughs) What's "carnal"?
-(Murgaw moans)

59:58.875 --> 1:00:00.541
It's just a... it's just a funny word.

1:00:00.625 --> 1:00:02.958
Something you should talk about to Mother.
She might know.

1:00:03.041 --> 1:00:04.625
-BIRDY: Really?
-ROBERT: Yeah.

1:00:05.625 --> 1:00:07.208

1:00:07.291 --> 1:00:08.833

My sweetest girl.

1:00:24.666 --> 1:00:27.416
My own raven-haired lass.

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.333
My beloved daughter.

"Beloved daughter."

My lady of Lithgow,
your bridegroom awaits you,

the-the man they call Shaggy Beard
is my betrothed?

1:01:01.833 --> 1:01:07.208
Catherine, be respectful.
His name is Lord John Murgaw VIII.

1:01:07.291 --> 1:01:11.958
And he is the last
and blessedly most wealthy suitor.

1:01:12.041 --> 1:01:13.666

He is a cave-dwelling troll.

A murderer does not deserve
such a punishment.

1:01:36.083 --> 1:01:39.041
It cannot... It... it will not be.

You're bold, y-you're playful,

but you have a strong sense of duty.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.708
Exactly my sort of woman. (chuckles)

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:22.708
The only women I can't abide by

1:02:22.791 --> 1:02:25.125

No, Father, you can't have killed Jiminy.

You can't have killed Jiminy!

to prepare you a traditional
Stonebridge poultice.

1:04:33.833 --> 1:04:35.833
It is, uh, rather lovely
and highly medicinal.

1:04:35.916 --> 1:04:40.583
You simply smother it over
your elbows, knees, ankles,

1:04:40.666 --> 1:04:42.916
and let it soak into your bones.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.291
You are even more considerate

1:05:13.166 --> 1:05:16.583
with a good old-fashioned arm wrestle,
which I won fair and square.

Well, um, you know how
a man has a sword down there?

1:05:37.791 --> 1:05:39.708
Well, women have a box.

1:05:39.791 --> 1:05:43.250
And, um, when you don't want to be
a virgin anymore,

1:05:43.333 --> 1:05:46.791
you ask the man if he can put
his sword in your box.

1:05:46.875 --> 1:05:49.333
Um, and it goes in and out and in and out.

1:05:49.416 --> 1:05:54.416

-He's tired.

-You've got to do what I tell you.
-You need to stop...

1:07:21.708 --> 1:07:24.291
-I want to meet the baby.
-The baby does not come for months yet.

1:07:24.375 --> 1:07:26.208
You have to let me meet the baby.

1:07:26.291 --> 1:07:28.541
Please, Father, just let me meet the baby.

Why are you wailing so?

1:07:54.958 --> 1:07:56.916
Perkin, we must be married.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.250
(chuckles) You'd make
a sorry bride in this state, Birdy.

1:07:59.333 --> 1:08:01.875
All we have to do is
get married tomorrow in the village.

1:08:01.958 --> 1:08:05.458
And only Morwenna and Meg
and the pigs have to be there,

1:08:05.541 --> 1:08:07.833
and-and I will be Lady Perkin,

1:08:07.916 --> 1:08:09.916

And what of my life? My plans?

Do you ever ask what I dream of
when I lay my head down at night?

1:08:29.416 --> 1:08:31.166
No.

1:08:31.250 --> 1:08:33.375
If I was of fair face like Aelis,
you'd marry me.

1:08:33.458 --> 1:08:35.208
It's not about being fair-faced.

1:08:35.291 --> 1:08:37.666

-I don't know.

BIRDY:
Uncle George is a hero,

1:17:11.208 --> 1:17:15.000
and mayhap he can tell me
how to be one myself.

1:17:15.083 --> 1:17:18.750
Not just in fantasies but in real life.

1:17:29.166 --> 1:17:32.416
No, Uncle George, it is I, Catherine.

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:35.041
No, no, no, no, no,
you've got to peel it first.

1:17:36.125 --> 1:17:38.166
-Just like this?
-Yes.

1:17:38.250 --> 1:17:39.916
Now smell. (sniffs)

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.916
BIRDY and ETHELFRITHA:
Mmm.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.791
(chuckling):
Oh.

1:17:43.875 --> 1:17:45.708
-It's delicious.
-Mmm!

1:17:45.791 --> 1:17:47.458
It is delicious.

1:17:47.541 --> 1:17:51.791
I tasted my first orange upon my father's
return from the Moorish country.

1:17:51.875 --> 1:17:53.916
Well, I should definitely like to go
to the Moorish country.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.791
You'd like to go anywhere
your father isn't.

1:17:56.875 --> 1:17:59.166
We have a baby due any day.

1:18:01.500 --> 1:18:03.708
I am to marry Shaggy Beard.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.541
Of Lithgow?

1:18:07.625 --> 1:18:09.250
It is he.

1:18:09.333 --> 1:18:10.541
Oh, Birdy...

1:18:10.625 --> 1:18:14.291
I knew it would be someone of note,
but I did not think that sort of note.

1:18:17.166 --> 1:18:19.916
Lord Murgaw keeps a fine house, you know.

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.291
He'll keep you well.

1:18:21.375 --> 1:18:24.125
He owns three small towns

1:18:24.208 --> 1:18:25.833
and a leper colony.

1:18:25.916 --> 1:18:29.083
Oh, perhaps you can keep an arboretum.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:31.333
George himself keeps a garden of plants
beloved by Christ.

1:18:31.416 --> 1:18:33.541
GEORGE:
It's barely a garden, my love.

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:36.041
It's a place to smoke my pipe in peace.

1:18:36.125 --> 1:18:38.875
Thus far, only the crows, I think,
are impressed with my green fingers.

1:18:38.958 --> 1:18:41.833
Oh, the crows adore George.

1:18:41.916 --> 1:18:43.958
My love, I must retire.

1:18:44.041 --> 1:18:45.666
I've only just arrived.

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:48.041
GEORGE:
I tire easily these days, Bird.

1:18:48.125 --> 1:18:51.041
My back stoops, and my stomach bloats.

1:18:51.125 --> 1:18:53.333
In the morning, I'll deliver you back
to Stonebridge.

1:18:53.416 --> 1:18:55.041
Uncle George?

1:18:56.458 --> 1:18:58.166
Will you tuck me in?

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.750
GEORGE:
All right. You blow out the candle.

1:19:03.833 --> 1:19:06.000
No, I want you to tell me a story.

1:19:06.083 --> 1:19:08.166
-Please.
-(sighs)

1:19:11.291 --> 1:19:13.541
I don't think I know any stories.

1:19:13.625 --> 1:19:15.791
You've traveled the world.

1:19:15.875 --> 1:19:17.791
You've seen the ocean.
You must know stories.

1:19:17.875 --> 1:19:21.333
Ah, but I did not keep a little book
like you do, Bird.

1:19:21.416 --> 1:19:24.041
So all the stories have slipped
through my fingers like snow

1:19:24.125 --> 1:19:25.833
when I try to take them home.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:28.791
Uncle George?

1:19:28.875 --> 1:19:30.500
Hmm?

1:19:32.708 --> 1:19:36.208
If you're a hero,
then why did you not try and save me?

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:38.291
Save you?

1:19:39.583 --> 1:19:41.916
From Shaggy Beard.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000
From my future.

1:19:45.666 --> 1:19:47.791
But, you see, Bird...

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:53.583
I'm not a hero.

1:19:56.833 --> 1:19:59.041
Can you forgive me...

1:19:59.125 --> 1:20:01.000
my sweet girl?

1:20:03.083 --> 1:20:05.833
Heroes are only in storybooks.

1:20:07.958 --> 1:20:10.500
Even the saints only escape by dying.

1:20:10.583 --> 1:20:12.708
That doesn't sound
like much fun, either, does it?

1:20:12.791 --> 1:20:15.833
Mm. Maybe.

-No, I should not.
-Or be a lady.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:10.500

1:22:10.583 --> 1:22:14.791

I could visit home.

-But...
-I could check on my mother.

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:16.791
I could sleep in my own bed at Christmas.

If we went on a big adventure,
I wouldn't be reunited with Aelis,

1:23:20.916 --> 1:23:23.208
and I wouldn't see the baby grow.

-Yes.

1:23:28.125 --> 1:23:32.875

1:38:24.625 --> 1:38:25.750
Goodbye, Breadberry.

1:38:25.833 --> 1:38:27.000
...but rarely does.

1:38:27.083 --> 1:38:29.208
Better late than never.

1:38:31.958 --> 1:38:34.000
Goodbye, Sir Neal.

1:38:34.083 --> 1:38:36.000
Sir Neal.

1:38:36.083 --> 1:38:38.041
I wish I could help every girl
in the world,

1:38:38.125 --> 1:38:40.791
but for now, I am enough.

1:38:40.875 --> 1:38:42.666
Goodbye, Lard Turd.

1:38:42.750 --> 1:38:44.541
(cooing)

1:38:44.625 --> 1:38:46.791
My favorite.

1:38:46.875 --> 1:38:48.791
But don't tell Breadberry.

1:38:48.875 --> 1:38:50.708
(chuckles)

1:38:50.791 --> 1:38:53.166
-(wings fluttering)
-(sighs)

1:38:54.208 --> 1:38:57.125
(cooing)

1:38:57.208 --> 1:38:58.916
(thud)

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.333
And I know he has not granted me a pardon,

1:39:01.416 --> 1:39:04.291
only a reprieve from the most ungodly
beast of marriage,

1:39:04.375 --> 1:39:08.625
but my father will find that my gratitude
does not mean I have lost my fight.

1:39:08.708 --> 1:39:10.541
(sighs)

1:39:11.791 --> 1:39:16.291
It is in this field I raged and dreamed
and met Aelis in secret

1:39:16.375 --> 1:39:18.375
and cried over Uncle George

1:39:18.458 --> 1:39:22.333
and over the fate
I have been able to trick just a bit.

1:39:22.416 --> 1:39:26.291
This is the goat farm where I met Perkin
when I was but a babe,

1:39:26.375 --> 1:39:29.000
hiding from Morwenna's silly slap.

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.875
And here is where the smell of bread
is so strong

1:39:32.958 --> 1:39:35.125
it makes me want to eat
the whole entire world

1:39:35.208 --> 1:39:37.041
as if it were a mere loaf.

1:39:38.041 --> 1:39:41.708
And someday I will take my little sisters
to the tippy-top of the village,

1:39:41.791 --> 1:39:43.791
and I will say, "Run, little girls.

1:39:43.875 --> 1:39:47.416
Lift your skirts and run
for everyone to see."

1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:02.333
(laughter in distance)

1:40:05.333 --> 1:40:07.583
(quiet chatter)

1:40:10.541 --> 1:40:12.708
Golden Tiger...

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.291
I've been waiting, hoping,

1:40:18.375 --> 1:40:19.583
dreaming of this moment.

1:40:19.666 --> 1:40:21.916
PERKIN:
Letters make words, words make...

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.625
(continues indistinctly)

1:40:23.708 --> 1:40:25.333
(laughing)

1:40:25.416 --> 1:40:29.291
BIRDY: Someday this journal
will belong to my sisters.

1:40:29.375 --> 1:40:32.458
The two of you can see what I made
of becoming a woman.

1:40:32.541 --> 1:40:35.666
It was not much, but it was my own.

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.791
For right now, it's up to you
to decide, Edward.

1:40:39.875 --> 1:40:43.833
Has writing in this diary made me
more learned or simply cheekier?

1:40:43.916 --> 1:40:45.750
(chuckles)

1:40:48.041 --> 1:40:51.000
-(Birdy yelling playfully)
-(Perkin laughing)

1:40:51.083 --> 1:40:53.708
-Okay, here.
-Okay, I'm gonna throw it.

1:40:53.791 --> 1:40:55.625
(both laughing)

1:40:55.708 --> 1:40:56.875
(panting)

1:40:56.958 --> 1:40:58.958
BIRDY:
Things girls can do:

1:40:59.041 --> 1:41:00.875
-run in the fields...
-(exhales sharply)

1:41:00.958 --> 1:41:05.250
...invent original curses, save the day,

1:41:05.333 --> 1:41:09.166
pee standing up--
well, that one was a bit tricky--

1:41:09.250 --> 1:41:13.541
and keep fighting,
no matter who may come on horseback.
