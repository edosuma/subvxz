00:02.767 --> 00:04.467
Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:04.533 --> 00:06.167
Never said "I love you"
to anyone.

00:06.233 --> 00:07.600
I never said it
to anyone either.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.633
I know I hurt you.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.267
And here you are
remarried already.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.433
Another soulmate, I'm sure.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.133
Pete's moving in,
he's hired me a bodyguard.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.600
I can't work for you anymore.
This is my daughter.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.633
You need the police.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.100
I was trying
to reach you,

00:20.167 --> 00:21.767
but you were too busy
going behind my back

00:21.833 --> 00:23.000
with Jelena and Terrence.

00:23.067 --> 00:24.567
I'm going into
protective custody.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.733
If we're able to buy the team,
then we'll trade Derek.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.200
The league is
pressing pause

00:29.267 --> 00:30.733
on the sale of
the Devils.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.233
Why?

00:33.233 --> 00:34.333
Let me explain.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.600
Rot on
the bench.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.033
I love you.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.167
I need someone who's able to
be there for me in every way.

00:39.233 --> 00:40.900
Can you do that?
No.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.700
Lucas isn't coming.
Why not?

00:42.767 --> 00:44.100
'Cause I told him not to.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.000
Pack your bags, Ahsha,
you're going to Vegas.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.200
You're staying here too?

00:49.267 --> 00:50.700
You want me to blow
on it for luck?

00:54.967 --> 00:58.167
I'd get some sleep before
you do more damage.

01:00.133 --> 01:01.733
You've been so stressed.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.667
Ahsha, I killed Olivia.

01:21.533 --> 01:24.233
German, you didn't
kill Olivia.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.733
We broke up.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.300
But your mail
kept coming.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.633
She sent you a letter.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.600
German...

01:34.667 --> 01:36.100
what did it say?

01:38.900 --> 01:42.200
No more secrets.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.967
I went to her place
to see what she wanted,

01:45.067 --> 01:47.733
and she told me about you
rigging the all-star vote.

01:49.767 --> 01:54.067
When I told you,
you already knew.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.267
Olivia said
she'd tell everyone.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.967
What that would've done to you,
I couldn't let her.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.867
I tried to talk
sense into her,

02:04.933 --> 02:06.833
but she just kept
getting more worked up.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.533
Said she was gonna take down
Oscar, your mom,

02:09.600 --> 02:10.933
the whole organization.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.900
I grabbed her arm, I just
wanted her to stop,

02:14.967 --> 02:16.467
to listen to me.

02:16.533 --> 02:18.633
It just happened
so fast.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.333
She yanked away...

02:23.133 --> 02:25.800
and she went over.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.367
She grabbed at
the railing.

02:27.433 --> 02:30.067
And before I knew
what was happening...

02:31.467 --> 02:33.067
it was over.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.500
I checked on her.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.300
She was gone.

02:40.367 --> 02:43.800
I don't remember driving,
but I must have,

02:43.867 --> 02:47.067
because then I was home.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.400
I waited for someone
to come get me.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.067
But no one did.

02:54.667 --> 02:59.133
The next morning, everybody
was at the groundbreaking.

02:59.200 --> 03:05.067
I thought... something else
was going on.

03:06.933 --> 03:09.467
Something bigger than me.

03:10.833 --> 03:14.100
It's been months.

03:14.167 --> 03:17.067
How could you keep
this secret in so long?

03:17.100 --> 03:20.600
Nobody asked me
about her.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.300
Not one person.

03:23.367 --> 03:27.633
So, I just kept
my mouth shut...

03:27.700 --> 03:30.367
until I couldn't keep
my mouth shut anymore.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.800
So, this is who you've been in
a twist over the entire time?

03:56.867 --> 03:58.700
Yeah.
Daddy issues much?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.267
Zero, Jude.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.833
We got a car waiting
at the loading dock.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.467
Go, I'll hold
the cameras down.

04:03.533 --> 04:04.967
Go, go, go.
Come on, guys, come on.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.500
Excuse us.
Go, go, go.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.067
Guys...

04:20.400 --> 04:22.500
Got these free from the guy
at the coffee shop.

04:22.567 --> 04:26.500
He was real excited
your boy swings both ways.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.300
I don't care what Zero swings
or where he swings it.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.300
At least Lionel's
distracted.

04:32.367 --> 04:34.300
And her smug face

04:34.367 --> 04:35.667
at the league when Derek
walked out with her.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.467
Already on it.

04:37.533 --> 04:41.200
I found a couple of things
we could use against her.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.667
Well, isn't this lovely.

04:55.167 --> 04:58.467
I can't believe
you did that.

04:58.533 --> 05:01.500
Kissing me in front
of millions of people.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.900
Now that everyone
knows about us,

05:03.967 --> 05:05.067
we can go
wherever we want.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.700
Except we kinda can't.

05:12.667 --> 05:15.300
That's 100 interview
requests since last night.

05:15.367 --> 05:17.733
Sports Center's
had us on a loop

05:17.800 --> 05:19.067
for the past 12 hours.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.367
What are you gonna do?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.800
Every move I've ever made

05:26.867 --> 05:30.567
has been planned out
in advance.

05:30.633 --> 05:33.667
Kissing you was not.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.967
But it's all
gonna have to wait.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.067
Why?

05:39.067 --> 05:40.667
Because I'm busy.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.667
This is where
I need to be, Pete.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.767
I'll have round the clock
police protection

05:50.833 --> 05:52.100
until the trial
in a few weeks.

05:52.167 --> 05:53.933
I'm not questioning
your decision.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.333
I came here to explain mine.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.367
It's a little late
to talk about

05:57.433 --> 05:59.533
why you went to the league
with Terrence and Jelena.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.900
The damage is done.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.767
You are safest when
the Kincades are out.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.833
Isn't that why you went
behind my back to the league

06:04.900 --> 06:06.367
and started pushing this
"for sale" to begin with?

06:06.433 --> 06:08.233
I didn't start this,
Oscar did.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.367
But I'm gonna
finish it at his trial.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.267
Until then, since I can't
trust anyone on the outside,

06:13.333 --> 06:14.867
this is the safest
place for me.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.067
Sloane.
Sir?

06:16.100 --> 06:17.767
We need to lock
the room down.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.667
Thank you, Officer...?

06:19.733 --> 06:20.800
Halford.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.533
You're welcome
to call me Karen.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.267
We're not done talking.
When can I come back?

06:26.333 --> 06:29.533
I wouldn't be surprised if
someone was following you too.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.500
Maybe you shouldn't
come back for a while.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.200
Psst.

06:43.267 --> 06:45.433
When I was his boss,

06:45.500 --> 06:47.167
he would flirt
with me constantly.

06:47.233 --> 06:48.500
Old me never did
a thing about it,

06:48.567 --> 06:51.167
but new me just
made it happen.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.433
You might also wanna
hit up a drugstore,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.167
'cause old you
already has a kid.

06:54.233 --> 06:57.100
Speaking of, my babysitter's
out of town.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.600
I need someone
to watch Miguel.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.467
That is a pickle.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.300
Are you gonna be
my babysitter, Kyle?

07:04.367 --> 07:07.400
Or do I cancel the most
promising date

07:07.467 --> 07:09.067
I've had in months.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.067
Teddy's off
hiring a crew

07:13.067 --> 07:14.367
with filming about
to start.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.833
So, I guess
I'm technically free.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.400
You're the best,
you know that?

07:18.467 --> 07:20.600
I want every
filthy detail,

07:20.667 --> 07:22.100
and there better be
a lot of them.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.800
Thank you.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.567
I heard about your
showdown at the league.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.500
Unfortunate,
but not fatal.

07:34.567 --> 07:36.633
Safe to assume you have
your next move in mind?

07:36.700 --> 07:39.600
Funny enough, we were
discussing that this morning,

07:39.667 --> 07:43.333
when we stumbled on something
equally unfortunate.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.133
You and Lionel dated.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.967
Nothing changes,
or has to change.

07:52.067 --> 07:55.067
She burned me, bad.

07:55.067 --> 07:59.133
It's not something
I go around bragging about.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.733
If making Lionel suffer
is your goal,

08:00.800 --> 08:02.400
you couldn't have
picked a better partner.

08:02.467 --> 08:05.500
That's what we were
hoping to hear.

08:05.567 --> 08:09.600
Because we want to do next,
we need your help for.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.567
The Kincades own
the Devils,

08:11.633 --> 08:13.733
but they don't own
the arena that we play in,

08:13.800 --> 08:15.533
which is why Oscar
had such a hard-on

08:15.600 --> 08:16.833
for the Hollywood
development.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.867
I thought Lionel
sold that development.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.200
She did.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.633
Now, all she has is
our arena to call home.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.333
Which is why we want to drive
a wedge between her

08:25.400 --> 08:27.267
and the guy
who owns it.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.667
I mean Farhadi.

08:29.733 --> 08:33.533
Amin's always had problems
with Oscar, he's a powder keg.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.533
And he's a friend of yours.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.767
He is.

08:39.967 --> 08:43.400
I'd love to throw some
gasoline on that fire.

08:50.733 --> 08:53.567
The prosecutor had these
dropped off at your house.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.400
Thanks for bringing it.
It's no problem.

08:57.467 --> 09:00.667
We got a guy who's keeping
watch on your house,

09:00.733 --> 09:03.233
and he mentioned that there's
a couple of suspicious vehicles

09:03.300 --> 09:06.067
that have been making
the rounds around there.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.700
So, it's a good thing
you're here.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.100
I'm checking
on my daughter.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.833
She only communicates
by text.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.200
Mine too.

09:14.267 --> 09:16.667
Except she only
uses emoji.

09:16.733 --> 09:19.367
Today, she sent me
a peace sign,

09:19.433 --> 09:21.467
an alien head
and a sushi roll.

09:21.533 --> 09:24.667
I haven't deciphered
what that means yet.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.967
Look, I've never met
Oscar Kincade,

09:30.067 --> 09:31.633
but he's clearly
a bad guy.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.333
But you don't have to
worry about him.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.333
You're safe here.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.767
It's actually not Oscar
that's throwing me.

09:42.367 --> 09:45.533
It's this hotel.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.133
I have some history here.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.633
I didn't realize.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.600
I can check on
alternatives if you'd like.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.700
I'd like that.
Thank you.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.967
Devils Nation
is about inclusion.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.100
We support Zero
and Jude as employees

10:15.167 --> 10:16.600
and as a couple.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.033
Consider that
our official statement.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.867
Amin, I didn't think
we had a meeting today.

10:21.933 --> 10:23.767
We don't.
This'll be quick.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.200
I got a call from
a friend of mine.

10:26.267 --> 10:27.567
He told me
I could be named

10:27.633 --> 10:29.767
in any number
of civil suits

10:29.833 --> 10:31.300
because of Oscar's
criminal activity

10:31.367 --> 10:32.967
inside my building.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.833
Illegal recordings,
sex trafficking.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.200
I can only imagine
what else.

10:36.267 --> 10:39.067
I doubt you'd be held
responsible for any of that.

10:39.133 --> 10:42.133
Then you won't mind
signing this release,

10:42.200 --> 10:45.667
accepting responsibility
for any lawsuits against me.

10:52.333 --> 10:55.000
I've severed all my ties
with Oscar.

10:55.067 --> 10:56.233
If you have concerns,

10:56.300 --> 10:59.533
you should
take it up with him.

11:00.833 --> 11:05.467
I'm taking it up
with you.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.867
We have a contract.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.733
You can't just throw
a tantrum and lock me out.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.800
Our contract has
a morality clause,

11:11.867 --> 11:13.200
so actually, I can.

11:13.267 --> 11:17.900
If I sign this, it's a pure
and legal disaster.

11:17.967 --> 11:21.567
I have a celebrity pickup
game here in a few hours.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.433
Amin, let's get
together this week

11:23.500 --> 11:25.233
and we can hash
all this out.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.300
Hash this!
The arena is closed.

11:27.367 --> 11:29.767
Have everyone out in 30
or I call the police.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.633
Lionel, what the hell?

11:45.700 --> 11:48.133
I don't know.
Amin got a bug up his ass

11:48.200 --> 11:50.167
and we're locked out
of our own house.

11:50.233 --> 11:51.800
I was able to move
the pickup game to Venice.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.167
I need you to
cover it for me.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.300
You're not going?

11:54.367 --> 11:55.733
People are gonna be
talking about this.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.133
They're gonna have
even more to talk about

11:57.200 --> 11:59.300
if the next home game
is in my driveway.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.067
It's in three days.

12:01.067 --> 12:03.067
I have ten lawyers
coming here right now.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.333
If Amin wants a war,
he's got one.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.900
So, how many parts
still left to cast?

12:09.967 --> 12:11.933
None. I'm told
they're all cast.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.333
That's not what I called
you over here for.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.733
Well, what'd you
call me over here for?

12:17.700 --> 12:20.133
What's that?
Not what, who.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.100
Miguel, Raquel's boy.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.433
Like a little Mexican
Precious Moments doll.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.067
I said we'd watch him.

12:28.133 --> 12:30.500
Well, I got a dance
to get to.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.633
I'll be back in a jiff.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.400
Whoa, Kyle, hold up.
I don't do...

12:33.467 --> 12:35.467
kids!

12:39.600 --> 12:40.867
Oh, all day.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.900
A.C., what up, bro?
Good to see you.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.300
Man, it's good
seeing you.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.200
You know I've been waiting
years to get you out here.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.500
Glad you finally used some
of that signing bonus, huh,

12:48.567 --> 12:50.133
and got some big boy pants,
showed up.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.467
I just hope you brought your
24-karat gold walker with you,

12:52.533 --> 12:54.533
old man, 'cause you gonna
need it after we done here.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.133
Just have a seat, man.
Don't run. Don't-- don't...

12:56.200 --> 12:57.633
Get out of here, man.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.933
Yo, D, I...

13:02.067 --> 13:03.600
I...

13:03.667 --> 13:05.733
What, what, what?

13:32.700 --> 13:34.433
It's halftime.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.633
Please welcome your
Los Angeles Devil Girls.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.733
Venice grit
looks good on you.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.067
Zero, what's it
like being the first
out-starter in history?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.433
When did you hook up
with the boss' son?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.467
Is he your boyfriend?

15:48.533 --> 15:50.600
Are you making
a statement?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.300
You want my statement?

15:53.433 --> 15:54.767
That's my statement.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.600
I thought you ghosted
on me.

16:06.067 --> 16:08.067
Here I am.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.067
Here you are,
but German's not.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.933
You get a chance
to talk to him?

16:16.067 --> 16:18.633
Not yet.
I get it now.

16:21.433 --> 16:25.867
I've been thinking about
bonds between people...

16:29.067 --> 16:32.967
what makes them stronger,
what tears them apart.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.633
Yeah, I've been wondering
the same thing lately

16:35.700 --> 16:36.867
about me and T.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.967
I thought you two
looked tense.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.100
What happened?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.267
He... he wants
to buy the team

16:42.333 --> 16:43.967
and he was willing to get
rid of me to do it,

16:44.067 --> 16:46.333
after all
we've been through.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.767
Like, he was my best friend
and he sold me out.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.800
I'll never forget it.

16:52.867 --> 16:58.467
People can...
do surprising things.

16:58.533 --> 17:01.167
Like in Vegas?

17:01.233 --> 17:03.700
I can't stop
thinking about it.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.067
I better head home.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.967
How was the dance?

17:33.067 --> 17:35.500
Good.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.300
Thought I might
see you there.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.500
People were asking
where you were.

17:46.967 --> 17:49.067
I had to finish
the scouting report.

17:59.267 --> 18:04.267
We've been through so much,
but nothing like this.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.767
So, I want you
to know you can leave.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.367
You want me to go?

18:12.433 --> 18:14.633
No, I don't.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.867
But this is
my secret to keep.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.433
You don't have to
take it on too.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.067
I know you love me,

18:29.067 --> 18:31.633
but this is above
and beyond that.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.733
I can handle whatever
you decide, Ahsha.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.200
It's your choice.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.333
When did lunch
become San Diego?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.500
Well, that's where
the restaurant was.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.633
He drove us down.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.067
He asked if I wanted
to spend the night.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.267
I would love to, but...
But what?

18:59.333 --> 19:01.600
I mean, could you handle
Miguel for that long?

19:01.667 --> 19:03.267
Do you not think that
I can take care of him

19:03.333 --> 19:04.600
for more than
a few hours?

19:04.667 --> 19:07.533
Of course I do, Kyle.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.400
Can you put him on?
No, I cannot.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.300
Raquel, I am
entirely capable

19:11.367 --> 19:13.700
of keeping a child
alive overnight.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.067
Stay, have
a grand old time,

19:15.067 --> 19:16.367
and when you come back,

19:16.433 --> 19:18.100
he's gonna be
calling me "Mommy."

19:23.067 --> 19:24.733
It was an accident.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.267
What was an accident?

19:29.067 --> 19:30.467
I was teaching him

19:30.533 --> 19:32.133
how to count cards
and I dropped a jack.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.433
I went to pick it up
and kind of bumped him.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.733
You punched a child
in the face?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.500
No, it wasn't a fist,
it was an elbow.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.267
He's at that
awkward height.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.967
It doesn't hurt.
It may not
hurt you, darling,

19:43.067 --> 19:44.400
but it's gonna be
a world of hurt for me

19:44.467 --> 19:46.800
when your mama gets home.
Should we call her?

19:46.867 --> 19:48.900
No, we should not
call her.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.267
With hickeys, you know,
the best way to get rid of 'em

19:51.333 --> 19:54.067
is to grab 'em and just
give 'em a turn.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.567
You want to twist
the kid's face?

19:55.633 --> 19:58.133
Well, when you
put it like that...

19:58.200 --> 19:59.500
Yeah, I get popped
every few weeks.

19:59.567 --> 20:01.433
Throw a steak on it,
put him to bed,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.533
and the swelling should
go down in the morning.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.967
Tú sí la amas.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.333
Got an eighth-month edamame
or a two-month-old pork chop.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.033
Yeah, this thing's
turning purple.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.800
Pork chop it is.

20:13.967 --> 20:15.733
See ya, buddy.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.133
This is nice, right?

20:24.200 --> 20:28.167
Away from the crowd,
as a little relaxation time.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.767
These come with
a bottle of Jack?

20:33.267 --> 20:35.933
Told my publicist
I'd do any interviews

20:36.000 --> 20:37.967
so long as
we only talk ball.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.567
You know how many
requests I got?

20:40.633 --> 20:42.667
Zero.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.167
You're a starter
with two rings.

20:46.233 --> 20:47.967
You kiss a guy
in front of everyone.

20:55.167 --> 20:59.133
You know what?
I regret it.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.633
I knew you wouldn't
leave it to Jackson

21:11.700 --> 21:13.600
to do all the work.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.067
There he is.

21:17.767 --> 21:20.633
Amin, right?
You own the arena?

21:20.700 --> 21:23.600
I know who you are.
You know I own this club.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.933
Lionel's already sicced every
lawyer in Los Angeles on me.

21:27.067 --> 21:29.167
If you're here to hassle me
about letting you guys--

21:29.233 --> 21:32.067
Hassle you? No.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.500
We want to
buy you a round.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.167
Buy me a--?
The bitch needs to go.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.200
Get my friends here
a round of shots.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.400
You can get
the next round.

21:59.467 --> 22:00.467
Jackson.

22:00.533 --> 22:03.200
This is a surprise.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.067
You look rough.

22:09.733 --> 22:13.167
I just paid ten lawyers to do
absolutely nothing for me.

22:13.233 --> 22:15.900
Ten men couldn't
satisfy you?

22:15.967 --> 22:18.900
I'm shocked.

22:18.967 --> 22:21.233
Jackson?

22:22.633 --> 22:26.367
How long do you plan
on hating me?

22:27.700 --> 22:31.167
Hate implies investment.
I'm apathetic.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.700
I've always hated
that line of yours.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.433
Great. There went
my dinner plans.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.367
Have dinner with me.
My treat.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.167
I'll eat crow.
You can have the steak.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.433
I'm not gonna sit
around and play nice

22:50.500 --> 22:51.600
just for a free meal.

22:51.667 --> 22:54.300
It wouldn't be any fun
if you did.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.367
What the hell?

23:15.100 --> 23:17.200
Ahsha,
you shouldn't be here.

23:17.267 --> 23:18.833
We moved you out
for a reason.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.600
I was worried about you.

23:20.667 --> 23:24.067
I'm fine.
Go back to German's.

23:29.267 --> 23:32.400
If you can be here,
so can I.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.267
You can protect me.
Oh, can I?

23:34.333 --> 23:36.700
I couldn't protect
your mother.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.967
She's living out of
a suitcase right now,

23:39.067 --> 23:40.300
someplace I'm not.

23:41.733 --> 23:44.167
Our life was not supposed
to turn out like this.

23:44.233 --> 23:47.267
This is insanity.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.833
How do you know when
enough is enough?

23:54.533 --> 23:59.433
You just have to ask yourself,
how much can you endure?

24:07.067 --> 24:08.567
You have a few more grays.

24:08.633 --> 24:11.867
And you have a few less.

24:11.933 --> 24:14.367
Amazing what color
in a box can do.

24:14.433 --> 24:16.133
I don't dye
my hair, jerk.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.400
No, you just
marry older men

24:19.467 --> 24:21.700
to appear sprightly
by comparison.

24:21.767 --> 24:23.400
Who pissed you off
today, Lionel?

24:23.467 --> 24:25.733
I'd like to send them
a thank you card.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.567
Let's have revenge sex.

24:33.067 --> 24:34.467
Revenge?

24:34.533 --> 24:36.100
You're pissed at me,
I'm pissed at the world.

24:36.167 --> 24:37.667
Let's take it out
on each other.

24:37.733 --> 24:39.500
One night.
What do you say?

24:44.367 --> 24:46.967
Unless you don't
want to make me suffer.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.300
Revenge sex it is.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.667
Thanks.
You're welcome.

24:58.733 --> 25:02.400
100 bucks for some
steamed vegetables and rice.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.067
I'd crack open
a bottle of water,

25:04.100 --> 25:07.067
but I'm afraid of
bankrupting the precinct.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.600
Was this place
always this swank?

25:10.667 --> 25:14.933
It hasn't changed at all.

25:15.067 --> 25:17.833
I gotta ask,
what happened here?

25:20.700 --> 25:25.633
It's probably part of why
I was short with Pete earlier.

25:25.700 --> 25:29.900
It was a long time ago,
but I never forgot it.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.567
This hotel is where
I walked in on him

25:33.633 --> 25:35.767
having sex
with another woman,

25:35.833 --> 25:36.967
Olivia Vincent.

25:40.233 --> 25:41.767
Were you close?

25:41.833 --> 25:45.267
We were.
Not that night, though.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.767
That night,
I could have killed her.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.500
Best friend sleeps
with your boyfriend,

25:49.567 --> 25:50.867
that's below the basement.

25:50.933 --> 25:52.700
And I didn't find them
by accident.

25:52.767 --> 25:54.667
I was invited
here by Olivia.

25:54.733 --> 25:56.700
She said it was a party.

25:56.767 --> 25:58.833
I never hated anyone
so much.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.900
Why would she
want you to see?

26:00.967 --> 26:03.400
She wanted to split us up
so she could have him,

26:03.467 --> 26:05.167
and it worked.

26:05.233 --> 26:07.800
Olivia took everything
from me...

26:07.867 --> 26:10.667
my place at the top,
the love of my life.

26:10.733 --> 26:13.567
That sounds like a hard
thing to forgive, boy.

26:13.633 --> 26:15.633
Forgiveness
is the one thing

26:15.700 --> 26:17.200
Olivia never got
from me.

26:25.767 --> 26:29.333
What about this--
her movie? "Ecstasy"?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.633
She must have been on it when
she agreed to make that thing.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.533
I saw ten minutes
on a plane

26:34.600 --> 26:36.533
and spent the next ten
praying for engine failure.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.833
Or a mountain.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.100
You too?

26:41.167 --> 26:43.867
Ahh.

26:43.933 --> 26:47.067
Oh, that woman.
30 properties,

26:47.133 --> 26:49.633
and this is the only one
giving me a migraine.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.467
We wanted her out
of the arena so bad,

26:52.533 --> 26:53.733
we pulled
everything we had

26:53.800 --> 26:55.133
to try and buy the team.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.600
Ah, I wish you would.

26:56.667 --> 27:00.867
You know... you'd be a lot
more fun to deal with.

27:03.067 --> 27:06.133
You know, there is
something you can do

27:06.200 --> 27:09.233
to make sure you never have to
deal with Lionel again.

27:21.467 --> 27:24.633
Over a disagreement with
arena owner Amin Farhadi,

27:24.700 --> 27:28.067
this unprecedented lockout
has forced Devils owner

27:28.067 --> 27:30.867
Lionel Davenport to relocate
tomorrow's home game

27:30.933 --> 27:32.333
to the stadium at UCLA.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.633
Thank you, Cheryl.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.767
Reporting from what
was once the home

27:36.833 --> 27:39.667
of your Los Angeles Devils,
now we go to...

27:41.233 --> 27:44.067
A college stadium.
It's humiliating.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.467
I didn't have a choice.

27:46.533 --> 27:49.267
I hired ten more lawyers.
Let's see what they can do.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.467
Do you have
any other options?

27:51.533 --> 27:55.233
Besides taking a baseball
bat to his skull?

27:56.367 --> 27:59.300
There's something
he wants me to sign...

27:59.367 --> 28:01.067
a release.

28:01.067 --> 28:03.300
It'd make this
all go away.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.667
So, sign it.

28:05.733 --> 28:08.367
It's complicated.

28:08.433 --> 28:10.400
Signing would put me
in a vulnerable position.

28:10.467 --> 28:13.233
You would know
better than I,

28:13.300 --> 28:15.667
but I do know business.

28:15.733 --> 28:20.233
And, well, sometimes you
have to lose a battle

28:20.300 --> 28:23.067
to win a war.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.500
Should've gone
with the edamame.

28:31.567 --> 28:33.267
I thought this was
supposed to fix it.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.100
All it did was make him
smell like Porky Pig.

28:36.167 --> 28:37.800
Well, kids get bumps
and bruises, Kyle.

28:37.867 --> 28:39.067
Just come clean
to Raquel.

28:39.067 --> 28:40.833
So she can tell me
she was right

28:40.900 --> 28:41.967
not to trust me
with Manuel?

28:42.067 --> 28:43.700
Miguel.

28:43.767 --> 28:45.100
Not a chance in hell.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.667
I am gonna show you
a little miracle

28:47.733 --> 28:48.867
known as foundation.

28:48.933 --> 28:50.333
That's for girls.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.467
Boys wear makeup too,
Miguel.

28:52.533 --> 28:55.333
Watch Uncle Beau.
Now.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.633
Tú sí la amas.

29:05.133 --> 29:09.067
Yeah, well,
you're up next, kid, so...

29:09.133 --> 29:10.733
All right, you don't
have to go this far.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.367
Oh, but I do.

29:12.433 --> 29:14.500
You're punishing me.
I am training you.

29:14.567 --> 29:15.733
If you'd been
more careful,

29:15.800 --> 29:18.633
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.733
Where's Miguel?

29:21.800 --> 29:24.233
My God.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.233
Well, see you later.

29:30.467 --> 29:32.533
Unless I see you sooner?

29:32.600 --> 29:36.733
Jackson, I... I know I said
this would be a one time thing,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.400
and it can be.

29:38.467 --> 29:40.400
But maybe it doesn't
have to be.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.867
Revenge sex
to rekindling.

29:47.933 --> 29:50.200
That's a big 180, Lionel.

29:50.267 --> 29:53.867
I'm also going to sign
that release.

29:57.467 --> 29:59.133
Don't.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.300
You wouldn't just be getting
anyone off your back.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.633
You'd be giving
Jelena and Terrence

30:02.700 --> 30:04.233
ammunition against you
at the league.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.500
Why would you say that?

30:07.833 --> 30:10.600
I've been backing them
in their bid to buy the team.

30:11.933 --> 30:13.800
You son of a bitch.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.467
Was all this just--
No.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.833
Yes, it started that way.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.467
I agreed to help because
I wanted to get back at you

30:21.533 --> 30:23.000
for how you treated me.

30:23.067 --> 30:25.733
But I don't
want that, Lionel.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.067
I want... this.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.467
Now, I'll handle Amin

30:30.533 --> 30:32.133
and I'll pay him off
myself if I have to,

30:32.200 --> 30:34.500
that's the least I can do.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.167
Jelena and Terrence
would just love that.

30:38.233 --> 30:40.600
Well, they're gonna have to
find another backer regardless,

30:40.667 --> 30:43.500
because I can't take
this team from you.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.400
I won't.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.533
I got your text.
Everything okay?

31:07.867 --> 31:10.700
No.

31:11.967 --> 31:14.400
What you and I have,

31:14.467 --> 31:16.333
I will never have
with anyone.

31:18.267 --> 31:21.167
But...

31:21.233 --> 31:23.333
German's been there
for me in ways

31:23.400 --> 31:26.900
I can't even explain.

31:26.967 --> 31:29.700
Protected me.

31:29.767 --> 31:32.433
And he's going through
something right now

31:32.500 --> 31:34.833
that could break him.

31:37.433 --> 31:40.333
I want you.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.667
But I have to be
with German.

31:43.733 --> 31:45.700
So, I need
to back away.

31:49.267 --> 31:50.767
But you're not
backing away.

32:00.067 --> 32:02.533
Derek.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.467
This has to be goodbye.

32:32.633 --> 32:35.067
What were you thinking--
teaching him to count cards?

32:35.100 --> 32:36.333
A boy needs skills.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.067
He's probably putting them
to use right now.

32:38.067 --> 32:39.967
Is that supposed to be funny?
A little.

32:40.067 --> 32:43.633
Look, he's got tiny legs,
he can't have gotten that far.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.233
All right, we're gonna
find him, Kyle.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.433
Just calm down.

32:49.533 --> 32:51.300
Miguel!

32:51.367 --> 32:52.933
You had Beau worried!

32:55.533 --> 32:56.867
Is that curry?

32:56.933 --> 32:59.233
He must have gone up
the block to the Indian joint.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.067
Hello, hello!

33:01.133 --> 33:02.633
Hey!

33:02.700 --> 33:05.100
San Diego was gorgeous.

33:05.167 --> 33:06.800
I brought presents.

33:15.667 --> 33:19.100
Kyle, why does my son
have a black eye

33:19.167 --> 33:20.700
and a receipt
from Tandoori West?

33:20.767 --> 33:22.867
Well--
All my fault.

33:22.933 --> 33:25.167
Uh, the shiner
was an accident.

33:25.233 --> 33:27.367
I have never watched a kid
a day in my life.

33:27.433 --> 33:28.600
I'm a disaster.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.267
It was awesome!

33:30.333 --> 33:31.733
That's right, it was awesome.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.067
And it was all
Beau's fault.

33:33.133 --> 33:34.833
Miguel's had a long day.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.900
I think it's time
I put him to bed.

33:36.967 --> 33:39.067
I'll check on you
in a minute, papi.

33:40.233 --> 33:43.300
I-- I closed his fingers
in a drawer once.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.700
It happens.

33:45.767 --> 33:47.733
Uh, the kid kept saying
something to me

33:47.800 --> 33:49.133
that I didn't quite get.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.333
Uh...
"Tú sí la amas?"

33:52.400 --> 33:53.667
You love her.

33:53.733 --> 33:55.500
What?

33:55.567 --> 33:57.133
That's what it means.

33:59.267 --> 34:01.233
Huh.

34:16.633 --> 34:20.067
I know you're pissed,
and I don't blame you.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.667
You did this amazing
thing for me,

34:22.733 --> 34:25.767
and I never thought about
how it would affect you too.

34:25.833 --> 34:29.067
I get why you would regret
being with me.

34:30.733 --> 34:32.667
I don't regret
being with you.

34:32.733 --> 34:36.067
I regret letting
everyone else in on it.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.833
I liked it when
it was just us.

34:38.900 --> 34:42.367
I don't... I don't
like losing that.

34:42.433 --> 34:44.100
You haven't.

34:44.167 --> 34:47.500
Everything we're going through
is only gonna make more of us.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.300
Not less.

34:50.367 --> 34:52.500
We're still
in this together.

34:52.567 --> 34:54.300
It's still just
you and me.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.867
Well, for two people
who are in it together...

35:03.900 --> 35:05.900
I sure am alone
in this tub.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.367
I don't know
if you've noticed,

35:28.433 --> 35:29.967
but all the attention's
on you.

35:30.067 --> 35:32.600
Not a peep about
Derek Roman.

35:32.667 --> 35:35.133
Really?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.500
There are literally dozens
of reporters outside

35:37.567 --> 35:40.300
waiting for us
to get out of the bath.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.500
This one's for
the Instagram.

35:47.567 --> 35:49.267
Oh, now, you're just
goading them.

35:49.333 --> 35:52.367
Yes, yes, I am.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.067
Oh, here he is.

36:04.467 --> 36:05.733
Mind if I crash?

36:06.633 --> 36:07.967
Really?

36:08.067 --> 36:11.167
Sorry, guys,
I tried, it's just...

36:11.233 --> 36:12.433
He's a good person.

36:15.967 --> 36:17.733
I know this means
we're done.

36:19.767 --> 36:22.167
Why do you think
we sent you to her

36:22.233 --> 36:24.833
in the first place?

36:24.900 --> 36:27.333
It was a test.
You failed.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.567
While you were
working Lionel,

36:29.633 --> 36:31.333
we were working Amin.

36:32.867 --> 36:35.233
You should have given
him what he wanted.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.700
Instead, we convinced him
to give you

36:37.767 --> 36:39.767
your worst nightmare.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.600
What's that?

36:41.667 --> 36:44.833
He sold us the arena...

36:44.900 --> 36:47.933
for a very
favorable price.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.667
We're your new landlords.

37:25.300 --> 37:29.167
People were asking
where you were.

37:29.233 --> 37:31.833
I had to finish
the scouting report.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.800
Peter.

37:59.867 --> 38:01.767
What a surprise.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.633
A surprise?

38:03.700 --> 38:06.067
They kept me waiting
two hours.

38:06.133 --> 38:08.733
Given the situation, I thought
it might be inappropriate

38:08.800 --> 38:10.300
for us to meet.

38:10.367 --> 38:13.833
After all, your girlfriend
is testifying against me.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.833
All the back patting,
the smiles.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.067
I knew you were dirty,
but I looked the other way.

38:20.067 --> 38:23.533
Now, you have brought
every imaginable horror

38:23.600 --> 38:26.967
to my family, and I have
no one to blame but me.

38:27.067 --> 38:29.733
Careful how you
speak to me, Peter.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.400
If it wasn't for me,

38:31.467 --> 38:34.267
you'd still be passed out
by the pool

38:34.333 --> 38:38.400
with your beer gut
and my bitch wife.

38:39.433 --> 38:41.667
You try one more thing
with Sloane

38:41.733 --> 38:42.867
and you won't make it
to your own trial.

38:42.933 --> 38:45.067
Do you hear
what I'm saying?!

38:45.067 --> 38:47.400
Get him outta here.

38:52.467 --> 38:53.533
Doing okay?

38:53.600 --> 38:56.367
Surprisingly, yes.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.700
I actually have time
to study up for the trial.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.367
I'm checking on
other hotels,

39:00.433 --> 39:02.867
but so far, we haven't
been able to track down

39:02.933 --> 39:05.500
any other securable options.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.733
Something wrong?

39:11.800 --> 39:13.867
You said you never
met Oscar.

39:13.933 --> 39:14.933
Right.

39:15.067 --> 39:17.500
Then how do you
explain this?

39:19.767 --> 39:21.533
Oh, that's Oscar?

39:23.333 --> 39:25.833
You're working for him,
aren't you?

39:25.900 --> 39:28.933
Sloane, it's natural
to be paranoid

39:29.067 --> 39:30.500
after all
you've been through.

39:30.567 --> 39:31.667
You should get some rest.

39:31.733 --> 39:34.900
This hotel wasn't
an accident.

39:34.967 --> 39:38.067
You brought me here
to stir up feelings.

39:38.067 --> 39:41.233
Conversation
about Olivia.

39:42.867 --> 39:45.567
I don't know why,
but this is over.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.067
You can't keep me here.

39:52.133 --> 39:54.267
No, but I can take you
down to the station.

39:54.333 --> 39:56.133
There, I can
detain you legally.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.300
Detain me?
For what?

39:58.367 --> 40:00.100
Officers?

40:00.167 --> 40:03.433
Questioning, under suspicion
for the murder

40:03.500 --> 40:05.167
of Olivia Vincent.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.767
Next time on
"Hit the Floor"...

40:16.833 --> 40:19.533
These are your fingerprints
at the scene of the crime.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.933
This is Oscar,
he's setting me up!

40:22.000 --> 40:23.267
I'm innocent, Jude.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.233
I need you
to help me prove it.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.433
If you hurt him, I'll drive
my car so far up your ass,

40:28.500 --> 40:29.833
you'll taste wiper fluid.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.633
You're a rabid dog,
and rabid dogs

40:31.700 --> 40:33.267
need to be put down.

40:33.333 --> 40:34.700
German?

40:36.900 --> 40:39.233
Jelena Howard?
I'm looking for Terrence.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.433
I have something
that belongs to him.
