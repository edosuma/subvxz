Well done, Ben.

Well done, Mandy.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.719
Bad boy, Timmy.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.999
Zero.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.519
- You got a zero, didn't you?
- Yeah. So?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.919
- You'll have to walk home, then.
- Walk to London?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.759
- That's 20 decks!
- You can't ride a Vator with a zero.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.599
You know what happens.
You'll get sent below.

Expect no love from the beast below.

Help me!

Aaaaargh!

My name is Amy Pond.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.919
When I was seven,
I had an imaginary friend.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.439
Last night was the night
before my wedding...

03:08.520 --> 03:09.319
Come on, Pond.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.759
...and my imaginary friend came back.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.399
Now do you believe me?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.999
OK, your box is a spaceship.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.799
It's really, really a spaceship.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.999
We are in space! Whoo!

03:25.240 --> 03:26.679
What are we breathing?

03:26.760 --> 03:29.599
I've extended the air shell, we're fine.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.359
Now, that's interesting.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.519
29th century.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.759
Solar flares roast the Earth,
and the entire human race packs its bags

03:39.840 --> 03:42.279
and moves out till the weather improves.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.319
Whole nations...

- ...migrating to the stars.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.599
- Doctor?
- Isn't that amazing?

03:47.680 --> 03:48.679
Doctor!

03:55.120 --> 03:57.719
Well, come on. I've found us a spaceship.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.479
This is the United Kingdom of Britain
and Northern Ireland -

04:02.560 --> 04:05.559
all of it, bolted together
and floating in the sky.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.399
Starship UK. It's Britain,

04:08.480 --> 04:09.799
but metal.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.679
That's not just a ship - that's an idea.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.559
That's a whole country,

04:15.640 --> 04:19.079
living and laughing and...

04:19.160 --> 04:21.159
- shopping...

04:24.840 --> 04:27.039
- Can we go out and see?
- Course we can,

04:27.120 --> 04:28.879
- but first, there's a thing.
- A thing?

04:28.960 --> 04:32.239
An important thing.
In fact, thing one -

04:32.320 --> 04:33.759
we are observers only.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.879
That's the one rule
I've always stuck to in all my travels.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.519
I never get involved in the affairs
of other peoples or planets. Ooh!

04:39.640 --> 04:43.319
- That's interesting.
- So we're like a wildlife documentary?

04:43.400 --> 04:46.639
Cos if they see a wounded cub
or something, they can't just save it -

04:46.720 --> 04:48.999
they've got to keep filming
and let it die.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.479
That's got to be hard.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.159
I don't think I could do that.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.439
Don't you find that hard -
being all, like, detached and cold?

Oh, lovely(!)

05:26.160 --> 05:27.719
You're a cheery one.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.319
Never mind dead, look at this place.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.959
- Isn't it wrong?
- What's wrong?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.119
Come on, use your eyes, notice everything.
What's wrong with this picture?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.999
Is it...the bicycles?

05:37.080 --> 05:39.039
- Bit unusual on a spaceship, bicycles.
- Says the girl in the nightie.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.399
Oh, my God! I'm in my nightie.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.439
Now, come on, look around you.
Actually look.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.679

06:14.440 --> 06:16.879
There's an escaped fish.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.639
- Where was I?
- Why did you just do that with the water?

06:19.720 --> 06:21.679
Don't know. I think a lot.
It's hard to keep track.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.199
Now, police state - do you see it yet?

06:23.280 --> 06:24.239
Where?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.239
There.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.519
Saw it myself.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.399
Are you going to tell her?

London block, Oxford Street.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.399
A man.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.039
Did he do the thing?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.639
Apparently.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.679
I'll have a look on the monitors.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.839
One little girl crying. So?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.399
Crying silently.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.199
I mean, children cry cos they want
attention, cos they're hurt or afraid.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.799
When they cry silently,
it's cos they just can't stop.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.359
Any parent knows that.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.559
Are you a parent?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.359
Hundreds of parents walking past this spot

07:57.440 --> 07:59.359
and not one of them's
asking her what's wrong,

07:59.480 --> 08:04.639
which means...they already know,
and it's something they don't talk about.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.039
Secrets. They're not helping her,
so it's something they're afraid of.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.279
Shadows - whatever they're afraid of -
it's nowhere to be seen,

08:10.360 --> 08:12.319
which means it's everywhere.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.879
Police state.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.199
Where did she go?

08:17.320 --> 08:21.439
Deck 207, Apple Sesame block, Dwelling
54A. You're looking for Mandy Tanner.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.199
Oh, this fell out of her pocket
when I accidentally bumped into her.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.279
Took me four goes.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.519
Ask her about those things - the smiling
fellows in the booths. They're everywhere.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.719
But they're just things.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.999
They're clean.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.919
Everything else here is all battered
and filthy - look at this place.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.839
But no-one's laid a finger on the booths.
Not a footprint within two feet of them.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.319
Ask Mandy, "Why are people scared
of the things in the booths?"

08:45.400 --> 08:46.519
No. Hang on - what do I do?

08:46.600 --> 08:49.159
I don't know what I'm doing here
and I'm not even dressed!

08:49.280 --> 08:56.359
It's this or Leadworth. What do you think?
Let's see. What will Amy Pond choose?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.559
Ha-ha, gotcha!

09:00.640 --> 09:02.199
Meet me back here in half an hour.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.719
What are you going to do?

09:03.800 --> 09:04.919
What I always do.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.479
Stay out of trouble.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.519
Badly.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.639
So is this how it works, Doctor?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.999
You never interfere in the affairs
of other peoples or planets,

09:18.080 --> 09:19.599
unless there's children crying?

09:20.600 --> 09:21.839
Yes.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.839
You're following me.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.239
Saw you watching me at the marketplace.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.839
You dropped this.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.719
Yeah, when your friend
kept bumping into me.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.079
What's that?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.879
There's a hole. We have to go back.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.919
A what? A hole?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.999
Are you stupid? There's a hole
in the road. We can't go that way.

10:03.080 --> 10:07.199
There's a travel pipe down
by the airlocks, if you've got stamps.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.079
- What are you doing?
- Oh, don't mind me.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.159
Never could resist a "keep out" sign.
What's through there?

10:13.240 --> 10:14.799
What's so scary about a hole?

10:14.880 --> 10:18.159
- Something under the road?
- Nobody knows.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.159
We're not supposed to talk about it.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.239
About what?

10:23.280 --> 10:24.239
Below.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.759

you don't? Watch and learn.

10:32.680 --> 10:37.039
I am Scottish. What's wrong with that?
Scotland's got to be here somewhere.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.599
No. They wanted their own ship.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.999
Hmm. Good for them. Nothing changes.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.759
MANDY: So...how did you get here?

10:45.840 --> 10:47.919
Oh, just passing through,
you know, with a guy.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.279
Your boyfriend?

10:50.840 --> 10:51.839
Oh.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.519
What?

10:54.600 --> 10:56.919
Nothing. It's just...I'm getting married.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.079
- Funny how things slip your mind.
- Married?

10:59.160 --> 11:00.439
Yeah, shut up, married.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.839
Really, actually married.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.399
Almost definitely.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.879
When?

11:05.960 --> 11:07.759
Well, it's kind of weird.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.919
A long time ago, tomorrow morning.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.239
I wonder what I did.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.999
Hey-hey, result!

11:17.080 --> 11:18.399
- Coming?
- No.

But you do, don't you, Doctor?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.399
You know me?

12:59.480 --> 13:01.159
Keep your voice down.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.919
They're everywhere.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.759
Tell me what you see in the glass.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.359
Who says I see anything?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.599
Don't waste time. At the marketplace,

13:09.680 --> 13:13.239
you placed a glass of water
on the floor, looked at it,

13:13.320 --> 13:16.759
then came straight here
to the engine room. Why?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.239
No engine vibration on deck.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.039
Ship this size, engine this big,
you'd feel it. The water would move.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.079
So...I thought I'd take a look.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.079
It doesn't make sense.

13:29.160 --> 13:32.919
These power couplings,
they're not connected. Look.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.479
Look - they're dummies, see?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.119
And behind this wall, nothing.
It's hollow.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.439
If I didn't know better,
I'd say there was...

13:39.520 --> 13:41.519
BOTH: No engine at all.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.079
But it's working. This ship
is travelling through space. I saw it.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.839
The impossible truth, Doctor.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.359
We're travelling among the stars
in a spaceship that could never fly.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.679
How?

13:51.760 --> 13:52.759
I don't know.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.559
There's a darkness at the heart of
this nation. It threatens every one of us.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.039
Help us, Doctor.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.719

14:02.760 --> 14:04.639

15:25.160 --> 15:26.919
Marital status...

15:29.840 --> 15:31.759
...unknown.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.439
You are here because you want to know
the truth about this starship,

15:39.520 --> 15:43.799
and I am talking to you
because you're entitled to know.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.799
When this presentation has finished,

15:48.880 --> 15:51.679
you will have a choice.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.759
You may either protest...or forget.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.399
If you choose to protest, understand this.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.599
Ifjust 1 % of the population
of this ship do likewise,

16:07.680 --> 16:10.839
the program will be discontinued,

16:10.920 --> 16:13.519
with consequences for you all.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.399
If you choose to accept the situation -

16:17.480 --> 16:18.999
and we hope that you will -

16:19.080 --> 16:21.959
then press the "forget" button.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.039
All the information
I am about to give you

16:26.120 --> 16:28.439
will be erased from your memory.

16:28.520 --> 16:33.319
You will continue to enjoy the safety
and amenities of Starship UK,

16:33.400 --> 16:37.759
unburdened by the knowledge
of what has been done to save you.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.559
Here, then, is the truth
about Starship UK,

16:42.640 --> 16:47.439
and the price that has been paid
for the safety of the British people.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.999
May God have mercy on our souls.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.959
This isn't a trick. You've got to find
the Doctor and get him back to the TARDIS.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.439
Don't let him investigate. Stop him.
Do whatever you have to.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.559
Just please, please get
the Doctor off this ship!

17:29.320 --> 17:32.039
- (AMY'S MESSAGE REPLAYS)
- Amy?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.479
You've got to find the Doctor...

17:35.480 --> 17:36.719
What have you done?

17:44.960 --> 17:48.359
Yeah, your basic memory wipe job.
Must have erased about 20 minutes.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.359
- But why would I choose to forget?
- MANDY: Cos everyone does.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.719
Everyone chooses the "forget" button.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.959
Did you?

17:56.040 --> 18:00.439
I'm not eligible to vote yet. I'm 1 2.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.839
Any time after you're 1 6, you're allowed
to see the film and make your choice.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.679
And then, once every five years.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.439
And once every five years, everyone
chooses to forget what they've learned.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.959
Democracy in action.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.839
MANDY: How do you not know about this?
Are you Scottish too?

18:16.960 --> 18:20.479
Oh, I'm way worse than Scottish. I can't
even see the movie. Won't play for me.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.799
- It played for me.
- The difference being

18:22.880 --> 18:24.799
the computer doesn't accept me as human.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.119
Why not?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.239
You look human.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.919
No, you look Time Lord.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.359
We came first.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.799
So there are other Time Lords, yeah?

18:38.680 --> 18:39.919
No.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.159
There were, but there aren't...

18:42.240 --> 18:43.839
Just me now.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.799
Long story. There was a bad day.
Bad stuff happened, and you know what?

18:48.880 --> 18:52.759
I'd love to forget it all, every last bit
of it, but I don't. Not ever.

18:54.320 --> 18:59.319
Cos this is what I do - every time,
every day, every second. This.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.159
Hold tight.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.479
We're bringing down the government.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.839
Say, "Wheee!"

19:18.920 --> 19:21.399
Aaargh!

19:25.880 --> 19:28.439
(CHUCKLING) It's all right, love.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.199
It's only me.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.279
THE DOCTOR: Aaargh!

(AMY SCREAMS)

19:41.760 --> 19:45.239
Ah. High-speed air cannon.
Lousy way to travel.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.679
Where are we?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.839
600 feet down, 20 miles laterally -
puts us at the heart of the ship.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.959
I'd say...Lancashire.
So, what's this, then?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.759
A cave? Can't be a cave.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.599
- Looks like a cave.
- It's a rubbish dump,

19:56.680 --> 20:00.959
- and it's minging!
- Yes, but only food refuse.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.519
Organic, coming through feeder tubes
from all over the ship.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.839
The floor's all squidgy, like a water bed.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.599
- But feeding what, though?
- It's sort of rubbery, feel it.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.719
- Wet and slimy.
- (DISTANT MOANING)

20:15.280 --> 20:18.879
Er...it's not a floor, it's a...

20:18.960 --> 20:20.879
- So...
- It's a what?

20:20.960 --> 20:24.159
The next word is kind of the scary word.
Take a moment.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.919
Get yourself in a calm place.
Go "Om".

20:27.000 --> 20:28.679
Om.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.599
It's a tongue.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.799
- A tongue?
- A tongue. A great big tongue.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.399
This is a mouth?

20:37.480 --> 20:40.079
This whole place is a mouth?

20:40.200 --> 20:43.319
- We're in a mouth?!
- Yes, yes, but on the plus side, roomy.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.439
- How do we get out?
- How big is this beastie? It's gorgeous!

20:47.520 --> 20:50.159
Blimey! If this is just the mouth,
I'd love to see the stomach.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.719
(GRUNTING)

20:51.800 --> 20:54.559
- Though not right now.
- Doctor, how do we get out?

20:54.640 --> 20:57.799
OK, it's being fed through
surgically implanted feeder tubes,

20:57.880 --> 21:00.799
so the normal entrance is...

21:02.880 --> 21:04.519
...closed for business.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.679
- We could try, though.
- No! Stop, don't move!

21:10.760 --> 21:12.399
- Too late. It's started.
- What has?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.959
- Swallow reflex.
- Argh!

21:15.840 --> 21:17.279
What are you doing?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.359
- I'm vibrating the chemo-receptors.
- Chemo-what?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.959
The eject button.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.639
- How does a mouth have an eject button?
- Think about it!

21:25.720 --> 21:27.279
(GROWLING)

21:32.240 --> 21:33.479
Right, then.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.359
This isn't going to be big on dignity.

Aargh!

21:40.920 --> 21:43.359
(GRUNTING AND SPLASHING)

21:47.880 --> 21:50.439
There's nothing broken,
there's no sign of concussion

21:50.520 --> 21:52.799
and, yes, you are covered in sick.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.479
- Where are we?
- Overspill pipe, at a guess.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.719
Oh, God, it stinks!

21:58.800 --> 22:00.119
That's not the pipe.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.399
Oh.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.799
Whoo!

22:04.880 --> 22:05.959
Can we get out?

22:06.040 --> 22:08.719
One door, one door switch,
one condition.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.759
We forget everything we saw.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.279
Look familiar?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.759
That's the carrot.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.159
Ooh, here's the stick.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.759
There's a creature living in the heart
of this ship. What's it doing there?

22:23.040 --> 22:25.639
No, that's not going to work on me,
so come on.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.319
Big old beast below decks, and everyone
who protests gets shoved down its throat.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.399
Is that how it works?

22:32.880 --> 22:36.279
Oh, stop it!
I'm not leaving and I'm not forgetting.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.799
And what are you fellows going to do
about it? Stick out your tongues? Huh?

22:41.640 --> 22:44.159
(GASPS) Doctor?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.439
Look who it is.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.759
You look a lot better without your mask.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.559
You must be Amy. Liz.

She's very brave.

- How did you find us?
- Stuck my gizmo on you.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.439
Been listening in.
Nice moves on the hurl escape.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.599
So, what's the big fella doing here?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.399
You're over 1 6, you've voted.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.879
Whatever this is,
you've chosen to forget about it.

23:27.960 --> 23:32.159
No. Never forgot, never voted.
Not technically a British subject.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.319
Then who and what are you,
and how do you know me?

23:34.400 --> 23:37.239
You're a bit hard to miss, love.

MO consistent with higher alien
intelligence, hair of an idiot...

My whole family was.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.599
Your family?

23:49.680 --> 23:53.119
They're repairing!
Doesn't take them long. Let's move.

Old drinking buddy of Henry XII.

Tea and scones with Liz II.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.279
Vicky was a bit on the fence
about you, weren't she?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.719
Knighted and exiled you on the same day.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.679
And so much for the Virgin Queen,
you bad, bad boy!

- Liz 1 0?
- Liz 1 0, yeah.

- Oh, yeah.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.399
There's these things. Any ideas?

24:41.520 --> 24:45.279
Doctor, I saw one up top. There was a hole
in the road, like it had burst through.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.879
- Like a root.
- Exactly like a root.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.279
It's all one creature - the same one
we were inside - reaching out.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.159
It must be growing through
the mechanisms of the entire ship.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.919
What? Like an infestation?

24:58.480 --> 25:00.359
Someone's helping it.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.319
Feeding it.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.279
Feeding my subjects to it. Come on.
We've got to keep moving.

- Doctor?
- Oh, Amy.

Stop him. Do whatever you have to.

that my government is up to something,

to investigate her own kingdom.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.359
Secrets are being kept from me.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.319
I don't have a choice.

Ten years I've been at this -
my entire reign -

and you've achieved more in one afternoon.

when you came to the throne?

26:14.960 --> 26:16.479

What, you're 50 now? No way!

26:20.360 --> 26:24.599
Yeah, they slowed my body clock.
Keeps me looking like the stamps.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.079
- And you always wear this in public?
- Undercover's not easy when you're me.

Stays on by itself,
cos it's perfectly sculpted to your face.

in the interior workings of Starship UK.

- There's children down here.

are fed to the beast.

it won't eat the children.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.279
It's either the exposed pain centre
of big fella's brain,

28:29.360 --> 28:30.719
being tortured relentlessly...

28:30.800 --> 28:32.799
- Or?
- Or it's the gas pedal, the accelerator,

28:32.880 --> 28:34.599
Starship UK's go-faster button.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.839
- I don't understand.
- Don't you?

28:36.920 --> 28:40.799
Try, go on. The spaceship that could
never fly, no vibration on deck.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.399
This creature - this poor,
trapped, terrified creature.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.519
It's not infesting you,
it's not invading -

28:48.600 --> 28:50.879
it's what you have instead of an engine.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.359
And this place down here
is where you hurt it,

28:53.440 --> 28:56.279
where you torture it, day after day,
just to keep it moving.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.399
(REPEATED FIZZLING)

29:03.680 --> 29:04.759
Tell you what.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.119
Normally, it's above the range
of human hearing.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.599
This is the sound
none of you wanted to hear.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.679
(ROARING & HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING)

29:25.880 --> 29:27.719
Stop it.

(RHYTHMIC BANGING)

29:38.680 --> 29:40.319
Who did this?

29:40.400 --> 29:44.199
We act on instructions
from the highest authority.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.679
Iam the highest authority.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.479
The creature will be released, now.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.039
I said now!

29:56.040 --> 29:58.079
- Is anyone listening to me?
- Liz.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.479
Your mask.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.119
What about my mask?

30:04.920 --> 30:05.959
Look at it.

30:06.040 --> 30:09.519
It's old. At least 200 years old, I'd say.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.159
Yeah, it's an antique, so?

30:12.240 --> 30:14.559
An antique made by craftsmen
over 200 years ago

30:14.640 --> 30:17.279
and perfectly sculpted to your face.

30:17.360 --> 30:22.359
They slowed your body clock all right,
but you're not 50.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.639
Nearer 300.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.159
And it's been a long old reign.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.359
Nah, it's ten years.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.799
I've been on this throne ten years.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.799
Ten years. And the same ten years
over and over again,

30:37.880 --> 30:40.439
always leading you...

30:40.520 --> 30:41.519
here.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.239
What have you done?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.239
Only what you have ordered.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.279
We work for you, ma'am.

30:59.360 --> 31:04.039
The Winders, the Smilers, all of us.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.039
If you are watching this...

31:06.120 --> 31:08.759
If I am watching this,

31:08.840 --> 31:12.119
then I have found my way
to the Tower of London.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.599
The creature you are looking at

31:15.680 --> 31:17.839
is called a Star Whale.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.159
Once, there were millions of them.

31:21.240 --> 31:25.239
They lived in the depths of space
and, according to legend,

31:25.320 --> 31:29.159
guided the early space travellers
through the asteroid belts.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.039
This one,

31:31.120 --> 31:33.599
as far as we are aware,

31:33.680 --> 31:35.439
is the last of its kind.

31:37.200 --> 31:41.759
And what we have done to it
breaks my heart.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.959
The Earth was burning.

31:45.040 --> 31:50.039
Our sun had turned on us, and every
other nation had fled to the skies.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.439
Our children screamed

31:52.520 --> 31:54.799
as the skies grew hotter.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.079
And then it came,

31:57.160 --> 31:59.399
like a miracle.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.479
The last of the Star Whales.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.919
We trapped it.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.519
We built our ship around it,

32:06.600 --> 32:09.479
and we rode on its back to safety.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.399
If you wish our voyage to continue,

32:13.480 --> 32:16.839
then you must press the "forget" button.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.959
Be again the heart of this nation,

32:20.040 --> 32:22.319
untainted.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.479
If not,

32:25.560 --> 32:27.199
press the other button.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.079
Your reign will end,
the Star Whale will be released,

32:32.160 --> 32:34.759
and our ship will disintegrate.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.479
I hope I keep the strength
to make the right decision.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.439
I voted for this?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.039
Why would I do that?

32:47.160 --> 32:52.759
Because you knew if we stayed here,
I'd be faced with an impossible choice.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.279
Humanity or the alien.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.079
You took it upon yourself
to save me from that.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.639
And that was wrong.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.839
You don't ever decide what I need to know.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.679
I don't even remember doing it.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.399
You did it. That's what counts.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.039
I'm...

33:09.120 --> 33:10.399
I'm sorry.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.479
Oh, I don't care.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.519
When I'm done here, you're going home.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.679
Why?

33:21.760 --> 33:23.879
Because I made a mistake?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.399
One mistake?

33:25.480 --> 33:27.839
I don't even remember doing it. Doctor!

33:27.920 --> 33:30.159
Yeah. I know.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.959
You're only human.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.599
What are you doing?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.799
The worst thing I'll ever do.

33:38.920 --> 33:43.759
I'm going to pass a massive electrical
charge through the Star Whale's brain.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.279
Should knock out all its higher functions,
leave it a vegetable.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.839
The ship will still fly,
but the whale won't feel it.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.959
- That'll be like killing it.
- Look, three options.

33:52.080 --> 33:57.279
One - I let the Star Whale continue in
unendurable agony for hundreds more years.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.479
Two - I kill everyone on this ship.

34:00.600 --> 34:05.279
Three - I murder a beautiful,
innocent creature as painlessly as I can.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.199
And then I find a new name,
cos I won't be the Doctor any more.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.359
There must be something we can do,
some other way.

34:10.440 --> 34:15.279
Nobody talk to me. Nobody human
has anything to say to me today!

34:38.800 --> 34:40.119
Timmy!

34:41.480 --> 34:43.279
You made it, you're OK!

It's me, Mandy.

Notice everything. Notice everything.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.119
Our children screamed.
It came, like a miracle.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.159
It won't eat the children.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.599
Children screamed. Then it came.
It's the last of its kind.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.799
- Just me now.
- The last of its kind.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.159
Is this how it works?

35:15.240 --> 35:18.039
You never interfere in the affairs
of other peoples or planets...

35:18.120 --> 35:20.239
- Children screamed.
- ...unless there's children crying?

35:20.320 --> 35:22.119
- The last of its kind.
-Just me now.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.479
- ...unless there's children crying?
- Yes.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.959

35:38.040 --> 35:40.839
Whatever you're doing, stop it now!

36:03.680 --> 36:05.799
Nothing at all.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.039
Am I right?

36:08.120 --> 36:09.319
We've increased speed.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.079
Yeah, well, you've stopped torturing
the pilot. Gotta help.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.879
It's still here?

36:16.360 --> 36:18.559
I don't understand.

36:18.680 --> 36:23.759
The Star Whale didn't come like a miracle
all those years ago. It volunteered.

36:23.880 --> 36:28.279
You didn't have to trap it or torture it -
that was all just you.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.559
It came because it couldn't stand
to watch your children cry.

36:33.120 --> 36:37.199
What if you were really old,
and really kind and alone?

36:37.280 --> 36:41.959
Your whole race dead, no future.
What couldn't you do then?

36:42.040 --> 36:45.999
If you were that old, and that kind,

36:46.080 --> 36:49.639
and the very last of your kind...

36:49.720 --> 36:53.159
you couldn't just stand there
and watch children cry.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.519
From Her Majesty.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.839
She says there will be no more secrets
on Starship UK.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.079
Amy, you could have killed
everyone on this ship.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.279
You could have killed a Star Whale.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.919
And you saved it.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.559
I know, I know.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.559
Amazing, though, don't you think?

37:50.600 --> 37:51.999
The Star Whale.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.479
All that pain and misery...

37:58.640 --> 38:00.119
...and loneliness...

38:03.080 --> 38:05.079
...and it just made it kind.

38:05.160 --> 38:08.119
But you couldn't have known
how it would react.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.759
You couldn't. But I've seen it before.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.759
Very old and very kind,
and the very, very last.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.679
Sound a bit familiar?

38:25.960 --> 38:28.679
- Hey.
- What?

- Gotcha.
- Ha!

Won't they wonder where we went?

- Which Prime Minister?

The British one.

- Which British one?
- Which British one?

- Winston Churchill for you.
