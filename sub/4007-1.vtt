00:10.360 --> 00:11.510
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.720 --> 00:13.598
Oh, my God.
Dexter, what the fuck?

00:13.800 --> 00:15.280
Travis was here. He came at me.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.996
When I thought about everything he did,
I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.392
I have to call this in.
Maybe we should get rid of the body.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.674
Gasoline, fire, it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.071
I never wanted her
to go through this, Dex.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.430
Neither did I.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.354
I found a blood slide exactly like
the ones we found in Doakes' car.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.199
Bad people are still going missing,
and Doakes--

00:37.400 --> 00:39.596
Was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.399
I have to keep my secret safe.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.520
Otherwise my life, her life,
will never be the same.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.835
Are you a serial killer?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.191
I only kill certain kinds of people.
Oh, God.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.911
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
Dad taught me. He gave me a code.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.190
Dad knew?

00:56.400 --> 00:59.632
You're like a magnet.
Bad shit is gonna find you.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.036
Dexter is a blood-spatter analyst

01:02.240 --> 01:04.879
and Doakes always thought
something was off about him.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.077
What if Doakes was on to him?

01:07.520 --> 01:10.354
The Bay Harbor Butcher.
Maria thinks it might be you.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.636
Me?

01:11.960 --> 01:14.395
Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.434
All I can think about
is giving her what she deserves.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.955
Do what you gotta do.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.596
Dexter...

01:25.800 --> 01:29.077
You're the only person
I don't have to hide anything from.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.194
Maybe you understand me
a little better than I understand myself.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.114
I love you.
It's because she's a serial killer?

01:36.360 --> 01:40.513
If you love me, you'll accept this.
If I love you? I'm in love with you!

01:40.720 --> 01:41.870
Wha--?

01:42.440 --> 01:45.638
Debra's been in a car accident.
You poisoned Debra.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.719
You were supposed to choose me.
She's my sister.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.235
Goodbye, Dexter.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.830
Security footage
from before the fire department

01:53.040 --> 01:54.952
got the call on the burning church.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.318
What were you doing there, lieutenant?
Are we really that fucked?

01:58.520 --> 02:00.751
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.355
LaGuerta's an innocent.
She doesn't even meet the code.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.994
It's the only option.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.154
Hector Estrada. I was three years old
when you murdered my mother.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.032
You're Dickie Moser!

02:11.240 --> 02:12.515
Dexter Moser.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.239
- I have another kill I have to do.
- It's not so easy.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.358
I can't let Deb go down
for what I did.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.155
It's Deb. Whatever you're thinking,
please don't do it.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.396
So, what's the plan?

02:22.600 --> 02:25.195
I use her gun to shoot Estrada
in his puncture wound.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.835
Use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.673
Deb.
Dexter?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.199
You shouldn't be here.
Why shouldn't I be here?

02:34.400 --> 02:35.629
Shoot him, Debra.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.351
You have to end this. Shoot him.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.120
Stop!
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.673
Do it! Shoot him!

02:46.880 --> 02:48.837
This is not who you are.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.000
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.993
Put him down!

02:55.200 --> 02:57.556
It's true.
Everything she said.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.916
You're a good person.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.153
Do what you gotta do.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.510
Dex.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.312
I hate you.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.273
<i>There's nothing like a crisis
to help define who you are.</i>

05:38.160 --> 05:41.153
<i>A better person would feel bad
about LaGuerta's death.</i>

05:45.040 --> 05:48.431
<i>But the truth is
it solved all my problems.</i>

05:50.680 --> 05:52.751
<i>It's gotten me back on track.</i>

05:57.520 --> 05:58.795
<i>In the six months since</i>

05:59.040 --> 06:01.999
<i>I've coached Harrison's soccer team
to a championship...</i>

06:08.320 --> 06:10.471
<i>gotten the bowling team
back together...</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:17.913
<i>made some new friends.</i>

06:29.840 --> 06:31.877
<i>I'm a survivor.</i>

06:35.280 --> 06:37.317
She chose a career
in law enforcement.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.753
And I know for a fact that she
never regretted one day of service.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.039
It's a choice
that none of us take lightly.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.998
Is Aunt Deb gonna be here?

06:47.200 --> 06:50.238
I don't think so, but we'll get together
with her real soon.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.552
Maria was very important to me.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.798
She was a good cop.
She was my boss.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.754
Very briefly my wife.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.991
But mostly she was a friend.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.551
I miss you, Maria.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.234
We all do.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.752
Thank you, Lieutenant Batista.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.990
At this time, we would like to dedicate
this beautiful memorial in her honour.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.270
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow officers,

07:29.520 --> 07:33.230
I present to you
the Captain Maria LaGuerta bench.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.153
Okay, well, we're off to swim class.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.278
Say goodbye to Daddy.
Bye, Daddy.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.877
See you after work, Harrison.
Okay.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.634
A bench. Why a bench?

07:55.160 --> 07:58.153
She deserves more than a place
where people park their butts.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.476
It's a nice bench.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.639
It's concrete, very sturdy.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.998
You can buy them at the parking lot
at Home Depot.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.995
I'm sorry. Was that insensitive?
No, that's exactly my point.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.591
This all feels so cold.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.595
You're still hurting, I can tell.
All right,

08:17.800 --> 08:20.838
look, first of all, it's weird
when you try to speak Spanish.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.231
Second, don't ever touch me.
It's been six months.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.272
You're having a tough time moving on.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.039
How am I supposed to move on?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.755
My dining room is filled
with boxes of her stuff.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.150
He's right, you know?
It's been six months.

08:32.440 --> 08:37.037
Maybe you should just get rid of it.
And then what? She just disappears?

08:37.320 --> 08:39.914
Hey, Dex, I was kind of hoping
your sister would stop by.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.559
Yeah, how is Deb?

08:41.760 --> 08:45.151
She really wanted to be here,
but she's working long hours.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.794
She's better?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.235
Oh, yeah, she's great.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.715
That's good to know.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.511
Yeah, she took LaGuerta's death
kind of hard,

08:53.720 --> 08:55.871
even though
they didn't seem all that close.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.311
There's no telling
how you're gonna react.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.995
You know,
when Mike Anderson was killed,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.635
I just wanted to get away
from all this.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.072
It took Maria's death
to turn me back.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.440
It made me want to do nothing
but chase bad guys.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.917
I can't tell you how many times
all I wanted to do is what Deb did,

09:15.120 --> 09:17.874
walk out of here at lunch
and never come back.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.960
Yeah, Deb can be impulsive
sometimes.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.560
Tell her to drop by sometime.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.996
Place isn't the same without her.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.400
For a while, I heard from her every
other day, asking for some favour,

09:30.600 --> 09:33.513
but I haven't spoken to her
in a couple weeks now.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.638
Why is that?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.439
She's out of town.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.432
Right. The Keys.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.393
No, Fort Lauderdale.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.279
Right. Fort Lauderdale.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.831
Well, when she gets back,
let's set something up.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.032
It'd be good to see her.
Yeah, it would.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.072
I mean, I'll tell her.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.232
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

10:00.440 --> 10:02.318
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

10:02.640 --> 10:05.872
Hey, Vince.
Can you cover for me this morning?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.032
I always do.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.231
<i>Deb's working through this
in her own way.</i>

10:11.400 --> 10:13.960
<i>I just wish
she'd talk to me once in a while.</i>

10:18.160 --> 10:20.038
Ooh-aah.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.920
Supposed to be for both of us.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.474
Mm. I'm sorry.
I guess I got carried away.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.196
You're gonna have to share.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.798
Gotta take this. Business.
Okay.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.675
Yeah.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.199
No, I'm not splitting it up.
All or nothing.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.155
That is my best price.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.234
You've never worked with me before,
but you know it's a fair deal.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.279
It's 11:47 a.m.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.120
You have till tomorrow
at this exact time.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.432
Fucking amateurs.
What happened to your normal guys?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.359
I don't know.
They disappeared on me.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.792
Funny thing, being a fence doesn't
seem to be a long-term occupation.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.591
What about this guy?
Can you trust him?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.194
Can you trust anybody?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.673
Uh-uh.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.158
Maybe if you want,
I can back you up.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.720
I don't want you involved.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.837
Yeah, but I'm really--
Debbie.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.509
I appreciate it...

11:32.680 --> 11:34.751
Ha-ha.
but I got it covered.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.072
Ahh. What do you want to do today?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.397
Preferably something
that involves you in a bikini.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.557
Why don't we rent a boat?

11:41.760 --> 11:45.470
Like a pontoon, little thing,
we could go out, relax on the water.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.519
No, get something fast.
Let's get a speedboat.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.393
We can buzz the cruise ships.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.274
You like causing trouble,
don't you?

11:53.560 --> 11:54.710
I can't help it.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.117
It's funny how these things work,
isn't it?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.913
What do you mean?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.993
Like when I met you, I'd been
in that bar for almost an hour.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.913
I was about to leave.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.918
Then you walked in.
Yeah, I did.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.232
It's funny how something so simple

12:13.440 --> 12:16.274
as you walking in the door
at the exact right moment

12:16.480 --> 12:18.278
can suddenly change everything.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.758
Yeah.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.999
What are you doing here, Dexter?

12:48.240 --> 12:49.754
She could be inside.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.475
You know what she's been
going through. She could've

12:52.640 --> 12:54.393
done something.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.674
Deb.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.277
Deb, you in here?

13:13.920 --> 13:16.071
She's not here, Dexter.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.197
She asked you to leave her alone.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.960
For how long?

13:20.160 --> 13:21.992
I haven't talked to her
in over a month.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.635
I haven't seen her in two months.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.195
She's disappeared.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.551
She's disappeared
from you, Dexter.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.790
And that's her choice.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.472
What is this?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.074
Xanax.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.835
Paxil.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.230
Adderall.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.319
More Xanax.
All from different doctors.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.590
And pot.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.355
Great, she's mixing all this shit.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.954
I have to find her.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.595
Dexter, you're the problem,
not the solution.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.634
The best thing you can do for Debra
is to stay away from her.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.632
I'm the only one
who knows what happened.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.520
I'm the only one who can help her.
She needs me.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.512
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

14:03.680 --> 14:05.399
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

14:09.040 --> 14:11.032
I have to find her.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.150
Hi.
Hi.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.356
Can I help you?

14:26.560 --> 14:29.120
Yeah, I'm--
Dexter Morgan.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.511
Elway. Nice place.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.830
Thank you.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.875
Yeah, yeah, it's a big step up from
my robbery desk at Miami Metro, huh?

14:37.320 --> 14:39.437
And it's a good change for Deb
as well.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.798
Very smart of her, making a move
to the private sector, I'll tell you.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.310
She here?
She is not.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.480
You know when she'll be back?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.637
Not a clue.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.395
She's got a big problem
of disappearing on me.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.239
What does that mean?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.310
She don't like to check in
when she's supposed to.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.591
When's the last you heard from her?

15:00.120 --> 15:02.351
Been a couple of weeks,
at least.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.157
And that's normal for her?
Of course not normal. Debra Morgan.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.353
There's no "normal" for her.
That was the deal when I hired her.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.632
She's her own agent, she chooses
the cases she wants to work on,

15:12.840 --> 15:14.832
and she calls in
when she feels like it.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.829
But...
But what?

15:18.760 --> 15:21.320
She's never waited two weeks
to call me back.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.712
What case is she working on?

15:25.920 --> 15:29.038
Some smash-and-grab.
Guy skipped out on bail.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.077
Uh... Name is...

15:33.720 --> 15:35.951
Briggs. Andrew Briggs.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.715
Skip tracing, bounty hunting?
Isn't that beneath her?

15:38.920 --> 15:39.990
Tell me about it.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.840
I try to give her bigger clients,
higher-profile cases,

15:43.080 --> 15:46.039
but she seems to like
the down and dirty stuff.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.635
Your sister's a bit of a thrill seeker.
Really?

15:48.840 --> 15:52.390
Easy money for her. Gets a percentage
of everybody she brings in, so...

15:53.920 --> 15:56.071
Well, what else can you tell me
about the case?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.397
Not much more to it.
Find him, bring him back.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.717
If she brings the jewellery,
she gets a cut.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.553
That's all you know?
Like I said

16:02.720 --> 16:04.234
she's not big on checking in, so...

16:10.320 --> 16:11.515
I gotta go.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.753
If you hear from her, call me,
all right?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.954
<i>Is this how I'm going to find Deb?</i>

16:26.400 --> 16:27.436
<i>Dead and alone?</i>

16:35.520 --> 16:37.830
Are you looking at my ass?
No.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.430
I mean, yes.
What size do you wear?

16:40.680 --> 16:42.239
None of your damn business.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.110
It's just that I have all of Maria's
clothes, and I just thought maybe...

16:46.280 --> 16:47.555
Oh.
Yeah, no, it's--

16:47.720 --> 16:48.790
It's not your style. I get it.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.469
She was a very colourful woman.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.873
Hey, what do we have?

16:57.280 --> 17:01.035
Robert Bailey, 42 years old,
Miami resident.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.318
Killed by a single gunshot wound
to the chest,

17:04.520 --> 17:05.670
right above the heart.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.755
Judging from the stippling
on the wound, it looks like the muzzle

17:10.000 --> 17:12.151
was in contact
with the chest when fired.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.435
Suicide?

17:13.760 --> 17:16.832
No, the victim was killed elsewhere
and dumped here.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.434
Whoa.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.631
Parietal and occipital bone
sliced through.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.557
Back of the cranium removed.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.359
Okay, that's weird.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.000
And...

17:37.600 --> 17:40.160
looks like a piece of it
has been scooped out,

17:40.360 --> 17:41.999
like with a melon baller.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.039
Just got weirder.
We have a gun.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.310
So someone shoots this guy,

17:47.520 --> 17:49.955
cuts his head open,
and messes with his brain.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.598
He takes the body and the weapon
and brings them all the way out here.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.274
Why?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.880
People are crazy.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.679
I think we're done here.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.918
Okay, process the gun
for DNA and prints.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.834
With the rain...
Yeah, do it anyway.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.434
Dexter, follow up on the body.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.199
Will do.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.152
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

18:26.360 --> 18:29.114
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:32.118
<i>Where the hell are you, Deb?</i>

18:35.560 --> 18:36.994
<i>Andrew Briggs.</i>

18:37.560 --> 18:39.677
<i>The man Deb was looking for.</i>

18:44.120 --> 18:47.557
<i>Clubbed a security guard over the head,
robbed a high-end jewellery store.</i>

18:47.920 --> 18:51.994
<i>Got away with over a half a million
in unrecovered merchandise.</i>

18:52.160 --> 18:55.790
<i>Skipped on his bail,
been on the run ever since.</i>

18:58.280 --> 19:00.112
<i>Arrested three times for assault.</i>

19:00.360 --> 19:02.955
<i>Sent one guy to the hospital
with a broken jaw.</i>

19:04.120 --> 19:05.713
<i>This guy is dangerous.</i>

19:09.240 --> 19:11.630
<i>Did Debra get in over her head?</i>

19:24.040 --> 19:25.315
<i>"Password"?</i>

19:29.720 --> 19:31.040
<i>Nope.</i>

19:34.680 --> 19:35.750
<i>"Fucking password."</i>

19:40.080 --> 19:41.275
<i>Here we go.</i>

19:42.200 --> 19:45.591
<i>All of her charges for three weeks
have been in Fort Lauderdale.</i>

19:45.760 --> 19:49.197
<i>And mostly at El Mercado
on East 4th Street.</i>

19:49.360 --> 19:51.352
<i>She was there yesterday afternoon.</i>

19:51.560 --> 19:53.916
<i>I can be there in half an hour.</i>

20:11.720 --> 20:14.110
<i>That's the guy
she's supposed to bring in.</i>

20:22.720 --> 20:24.393
What kind of tequila you like?

20:24.560 --> 20:26.836
The kind that makes you fall down.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.912
I'll see what I can do.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.160
Hmm.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.874
What the fuck?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.154
Deb, what's going on?

20:51.880 --> 20:54.031
I'm working a case.
You should get the fuck out.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.192
You found your guy.
Why haven't you brought him in?

20:56.400 --> 20:59.518
How do you know what I'm doing?
I talked to Elway.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.960
You talked to Elway?

21:02.160 --> 21:05.039
He said you hadn't checked in.
I was scared something happened.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.794
I'm fine. You should get out.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.676
Deb, you haven't talked to me in weeks.
You haven't returned any of my calls.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.116
You completely missed
LaGuerta's memorial.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.879
Jesus Christ, I wonder why.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.794
And would you please erase
the messages on your phone?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.235
No one has heard from you.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.432
Yeah,
I'm fucking getting close to Briggs

21:21.600 --> 21:24.638
so that I can get the jewellery
before he fences it, all right?

21:24.840 --> 21:26.399
I'm a professional working a case.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.119
Why don't you get out of here
before you ruin it?

21:28.280 --> 21:31.079
You having sex with that guy?
What the fuck?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.350
My life is none of your business.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.954
Go.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.594
No, I'm not leaving.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.719
Fuck you.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.197
Do you wanna know why
I'm not returning your phone calls?

21:47.360 --> 21:49.033
Because I don't wanna talk to you.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.677
And I really don't wanna
fucking see you.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.794
Why?
Why?

21:55.560 --> 21:57.074
Um...

21:57.440 --> 22:01.673
Because you made me compromise
everything about myself I care about.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.076
And I hate you for it.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.676
No, you don't.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.592
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.757
Who's this guy?

22:20.280 --> 22:21.794
Just some loser.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.032
Is there a problem?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.594
Let's go.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.317
She doesn't hate me. She's messed up.
She doesn't know what she's doing.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.960
It's none of your business.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.840
She's using this job
as a way to escape.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.919
She can't deal with everything
that's happened. She's lost, Dad.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.352
You've done this to her.
Don't make it worse. Leave her alone.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.592
Motherfucker cut me off.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.992
Dexter, what are you doing?

23:05.440 --> 23:07.033
Hey, what's going on?

23:07.600 --> 23:11.435
You cut me off.
I'm sorry. I didn't--

23:22.640 --> 23:25.280
You lost control out there, Dexter.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.079
He knows what he did.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.158
Go home, son.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.797
Right there...

23:40.960 --> 23:42.314
Oh.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.556
Stop.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.070
Don't stop. Don't stop.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.914
Don't stop.
Jamie, I'm home.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.470
Oh, God-- You stopped.
Someone just came in.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.956
It's just Angel.
Yeah, what?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.270
What?

23:55.480 --> 23:58.234
I'm sorry, I can't have sex
with my lieutenant 20 feet away.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.590
I'm not having a problem.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.712
That's because you're
fucking superhuman.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.553
Oh, come on.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.356
Joey, the chance that someone
might find out our little secret...

24:07.560 --> 24:08.880
I know. Not gonna happen.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.470
makes it even more fun.
It's not gonna happen.

24:14.760 --> 24:18.674
Come to my place tomorrow morning,
we can finish where we left off.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.872
I can't. I have to be
at Dexter's by 7.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.116
What?

24:25.920 --> 24:28.560
Fuck. Mm.
Mm.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.120
Do me a favour?

24:30.360 --> 24:32.636
Distract him so I can
go out the side door, okay?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.274
How am I supposed
to do that?

24:34.480 --> 24:36.836
Throw some fucking
pork rinds on the floor.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.110
You owe me.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.000
Hey.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.998
You're all sweaty.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.760
Uh... Yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.639
It's good that you're working out.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.480
Yeah, just doing a little cardio.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.909
What are you gonna do
with Maria's stuff?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.312
Don't worry. It'll be gone by tomorrow.
Where?

24:58.520 --> 25:01.877
Charity workers are coming in
first thing in the morning.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.997
Feels sad, though.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.632
An entire life
just packed up in a bunch of boxes.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.392
You know, maybe...

25:13.120 --> 25:16.909
you should pick out
some things to keep.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.710
Come on. I think it'll be good.
You're right. You're right. You're right.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.479
Warrants...

25:30.280 --> 25:33.273
to trace Dexter's and Deb's phone.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.355
Right to the end,
she couldn't let it go.

25:38.280 --> 25:41.990
Tracking down Estrada by herself,
that's what got her killed.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.317
Yeah, well,
that's just who she was, Angel.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.677
Yeah.
A cop.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.400
That's who she was.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.234
<i>Deb should be up there
leading this briefing.</i>

26:07.160 --> 26:09.391
<i>I have to find a way
to get through to her.</i>

26:10.400 --> 26:13.313
This doesn't look good.
Who do you think she is?

26:13.680 --> 26:17.196
Methinks a riddle, wrapped in
Dolce & Gabbana inside a--

26:17.360 --> 26:19.670
Can't you ever talk
like a normal person?

26:19.840 --> 26:23.834
Everyone, your attention, please.
As you can see, we have a guest.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.717
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.520
She and I first met
when she consulted on a case.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.439
When most of you were
in high school.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.280
Dr. Vogel's been away from Miami
for a number of years

26:34.480 --> 26:36.631
but she's back
and has graciously offered

26:36.840 --> 26:38.797
her expertise
with our recent body dump.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.674
But we're only a day
into our investigation.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.395
I'm not here to step on
anyone's toes, lieutenant.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.670
It's off the books.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.553
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

26:47.760 --> 26:52.198
She's served as a consultant
on high-profile cases over the years.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.276
And she has written the definitive
textbook on the brains of psychopaths.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.234
That's how I know you.
Your work on profiling is classic.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.590
Thank you.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.833
I wouldn't normally
insert myself into an investigation.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.235
She said "insert herself."

27:05.440 --> 27:07.352
When I read about the body
in the paper,

27:07.600 --> 27:11.674
there was one aspect of this murder
that I found particularly intriguing.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.679
Vince, bring up that x-ray
the M.E. sent over.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.795
Thank you.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.434
You see this part here?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.996
That's the anterior insular cortex,

27:25.240 --> 27:28.472
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.240
And the hallmark of a psychopath is...

27:31.480 --> 27:33.472
<i>They have no empathy.</i>

27:33.640 --> 27:35.438
they have no empathy.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.671
Now, it's possible
this is mere coincidence

27:38.920 --> 27:40.752
but if someone goes
to the trouble

27:40.960 --> 27:43.555
of carefully extracting
a core from the brain,

27:43.800 --> 27:47.237
I think they'll give some thought
to what part of the brain he's taking.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.954
So why do you think
he did this?

27:49.160 --> 27:52.437
It's too early to say, but maybe
he wanted to perform an experiment,

27:52.640 --> 27:54.518
or maybe this was
simply a message.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.239
He wouldn't be the first killer

27:56.440 --> 27:58.557
to attempt to communicate
through a victim.

28:00.520 --> 28:04.036
Who was the victim?
Robert Bailey. Mechanic.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.749
According to his wife,
been missing for nearly a week.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.476
Was the brain drilled into
while the victim was still alive?

28:12.480 --> 28:14.119
Dexter?

28:14.320 --> 28:17.552
The ME indicated
it was done post-mortem.

28:17.720 --> 28:22.158
The preliminary autopsy also showed
bruising on the knuckles and knees,

28:22.320 --> 28:26.234
which could indicate the victim
was held captive in an enclosed space.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.955
There were no contents
in the victim's stomach.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.674
Signs of dehydration.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.918
The victim was missing for five days.

28:34.080 --> 28:38.438
That suggests a pretty elaborate
pre-kill ritual for a serial killer.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.275
This was just one body.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.474
How do you know it's a serial killer?
Oh, I doubt that this is his first kill.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.558
Those are usually more spontaneous.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.719
This was planned ahead of time.
A lot of thought went into it.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.796
I'm thinking we're looking for someone
at least in their 30s.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.997
Intelligent, organised.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.072
Takes great pride in his work.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.432
I think he'd enjoy the fact
that we're talking about him right now.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.994
You think there will be more?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.635
I'd be surprised if there are not.
Any suspects?

29:06.840 --> 29:09.992
No prints on the gun.
It sat in the rain all night.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.669
Same story with the body.
We're still combing for DNA.

29:12.880 --> 29:17.159
Okay, let's widen our interviews with
friends and co-workers of the victim.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.835
We need to find
where he intersected with the killer.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.430
Masuka, when ballistics comes in--
On your desk.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.790
Dexter, stay on the DNA.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.154
Thank you.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.033
Thank you.
Thank you.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.518
I hear the FBI calls her
the Psychopath Whisperer.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.393
How lucky are we
she's on this case?

29:36.600 --> 29:37.920
Yeah.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.236
How lucky.

29:42.280 --> 29:47.594
<i>Dr. Evelyn Vogel, neuropsychiatrist,
lecturer, just published her third book.</i>

29:48.160 --> 29:51.597
<i>And the last person I need
looking in my direction right now.</i>

29:56.440 --> 29:58.033
What do you think?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.152
It's nice, right?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.070
I guess so.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.073
Maria always had it in her office.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.676
I want you to have it
to remember her by.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.274
Oh, thanks. That's nice.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.639
You still haven't forgiven her?
It's complicated.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.752
It's all right. I understand.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.074
But if you can't accept it from Maria,
accept it from me.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.960
It'll make me feel better.

30:28.120 --> 30:32.160
Now, I know things were awkward
between the two of you

30:32.360 --> 30:34.636
before Maria so tragically died.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.910
So tragically died--

30:36.120 --> 30:38.919
She died because
she wouldn't leave things alone.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.512
I don't know why I said that. Sorry.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.510
I hope you
find it in your heart to forgive her.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.909
Yo, Dex-bot.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.999
Vogel wants your presence
in the morgue.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.360
Great.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.320
El Sapo.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.993
Hello, Mr. Toad.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.757
You stay in here.
I'm gonna meet him outside.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.275
Are you selling the stuff?

31:40.480 --> 31:44.394
Well, I don't have it on me,
but I'm gonna give him a little show.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.110
Deb, hey.
Been a while. How are you?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.875
I'm working on a case.
Andrew Briggs.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.034
All business, huh?
I only have a fucking second, okay?

32:13.280 --> 32:15.954
So can you look into someone
named "El Sapo" for me?

32:16.520 --> 32:17.920
Hold on.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.791
<i>Who is he?</i>
He's a fucking fence.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.356
I'll run it by the guys in Robbery
as soon as I get--

32:28.000 --> 32:29.559
You're welcome.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.793
How'd it go?
I'm gonna be rich.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.716
Dr. Vogel?

32:45.400 --> 32:47.073
I got a message
you wanted to see me.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.995
Yes. Thank you for coming.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.312
I was wondering if you'd had any luck
with finding DNA on the body.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.831
No. We found a few hairs,
but they all belong to the victim.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.960
Ah. So the killer will have to
be found the old-fashioned way.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.919
Boots to the ground.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.474
Yeah, I suppose.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.799
Quinn and Batista having any luck?

33:07.040 --> 33:08.156
Not as far as I know.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.353
The victim led a quiet life.
No enemies.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.870
Serial killers don't have enemies.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.713
Everyone's a potential victim.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.635
Well, if you need anything else,
just pick up the phone.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.320
Anybody at the lab can help you.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.236
I was interested
to have your take on this case.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.640
Me?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.394
Why? I'm the blood guy.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.713
The blood guy.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.274
How did you end up here?

33:40.640 --> 33:42.632
My dad was a cop.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.991
He kind of steered me away
from that.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.159
This seemed like a better fit.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.400
I was drawn to forensics too.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.836
But I chose to focus
on neuroscience.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.759
Psychopaths.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.557
We both chose murder.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.719
Maybe we're both a little crazy.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.119
Maybe.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.873
Mad scientists trained
to look at this as a biological mass.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.833
A body part.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.560
Yet somehow,
from all those firings of neurons,

34:15.760 --> 34:18.228
something intangible emerges.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.318
Emotions.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.359
Trust, morality, love.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.114
Unless you're a psychopath.

34:27.199 --> 34:31.239
But even then,
belief systems emerge.

34:32.239 --> 34:36.553
As with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.197
What was he like?

34:42.159 --> 34:45.072
Who?
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.596
James Doakes.

34:47.719 --> 34:52.875
If I'm not mistaken, he worked
with you here in Miami Metro.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.278
He was angry. Had a short fuse.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.597
Well, that doesn't
sound right to me.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.838
As a psychopath, he would be
disassociated from his feelings,

35:03.040 --> 35:05.555
not quick to anger.
Maybe he wasn't a psychopath.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.639
Oh, yes, the Bay Harbor Butcher
was definitely a psychopath.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.639
He'd have to be
to masquerade the way he did.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.792
But he was an odd one,
that's for sure.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.440
You're the expert.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.431
Just the way he picked his victims,

35:24.680 --> 35:27.878
persons who, on the whole, had
some sort of criminal background

35:28.080 --> 35:29.878
speaks to a strong belief system.

35:30.080 --> 35:35.394
Almost as if he operated
with some sort of moral guidelines.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.790
Guidelines.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.040
Yet clearly it wasn't a moral choice,
as psychopaths have no conscience.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.876
So why else would he kill that way?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.837
So he could

35:53.040 --> 35:55.271
get away with it as long as he did?

35:55.480 --> 35:58.678
People are less likely
to miss criminals when they disappear.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.435
Doakes was Special Ops.
Maybe he picked that up there.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.000
Maybe he did.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.111
Makes an interesting case study.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.276
I wish I could have interviewed him.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.280
Sorry.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.875
I look forward to working with you,
Dexter Morgan.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.790
Yeah?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.593
Oh, Dexter.
Hi.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.073
Come on in. Come on in.
Thanks.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.392
This Evelyn Vogel--
Quite a looker, that one.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.519
Heh. You know her?
Yeah, I know her.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.832
She consulted for us on a couple
cases when I was a captain.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.117
Last I heard,
she'd moved back to England.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.836
I hadn't talked to her in years.
And she's here now...

36:54.040 --> 36:56.874
Why? Because a killer took
a part of a victim's brain?

36:57.080 --> 37:00.471
She called me up out of the blue, said
she'd moved back about a year ago.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.514
She asked was I free for lunch,
I filled her in on the case,

37:03.720 --> 37:06.519
she offered to help.
Why, is she being a pain in the ass?

37:06.720 --> 37:10.316
No. I'm just trying to figure out
if she's an asset or not.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.752
Oh. Well, she's smart.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.753
So use her to your advantage.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.514
Will do.

37:18.480 --> 37:23.111
Why do you think she called now?
Like you said, out of the blue?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.239
Maybe the stars aligned.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.877
Maybe Mercury is in retrograde. I don't
really care the reason she called.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.756
All I know is this is law enforcement.
You take whatever free help you can get.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.237
So keep her in the loop, Dexter.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.074
Will do.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.071
<i>What if I'm the reason she's here?</i>

37:46.120 --> 37:50.160
Hey, when you talk to your sister, can
you tell her to check her messages?

37:50.360 --> 37:52.955
She asked me for some help,
and now I can't reach her.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.475
Will do.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.592
Is this about, uh, Briggs?

37:57.320 --> 38:00.677
No, she asked me to look into
this fence named El Sapo.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.071
Nobody in Robbery's heard
of the guy.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.352
All I know is
Briggs robbed the wrong store.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.914
It belonged to some mob guy.

38:08.120 --> 38:12.876
Now nobody's willing to buy what
he's selling except this El Sapo guy.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.355
All right.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.915
<i>El Sapo.</i>

38:17.120 --> 38:18.634
Daddy.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.757
Harrison, hey.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.235
What a nice surprise.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.154
No, not a surprise. We discussed this.
We did?

38:25.840 --> 38:29.311
Dex, you know I love working for you,
but I need an occasional night off.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.314
Right. We discussed it.
Okay, I've got his dinner in here.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.831
Spaghetti and meatballs,
green beans, chocolate pudding.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.596
Yeah, about tonight, maybe we could--
Harrison, those are Daddy's things.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.837
What's this?
Bye.

38:42.040 --> 38:46.478
It's a very expensive centrifuge.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.440
Come on,
let's get your dinner set up.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.114
Pudding!
After dinner.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.436
Pudding!

39:09.360 --> 39:10.874
Hello?

39:11.840 --> 39:13.035
I thought I made it clear.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.318
You meet me here with the money,
and I take you to the stuff.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.318
Yeah, I'll be alone.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.760
Fucking El Sapo is "El Idiot."

39:21.960 --> 39:24.316
When he comes here,
you keep yourself hidden, okay?

39:24.520 --> 39:25.556
Why?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.678
Because I don't know him.
Might be freaky.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.116
I wanna go with you.
We talked about this.

39:30.280 --> 39:34.877
I'm not doing anything that might get you hurt.
I'll meet him outside.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.279
You stay in here.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.876
I love this guy.
I love that guy.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.629
<i>El Sapo.</i>

39:55.840 --> 39:58.275
<i>Real name: Javier Guzman.</i>

40:02.600 --> 40:05.160
Harrison, please.

40:06.560 --> 40:10.839
<i>Robbery didn't know the name El Sapo
because he's not a fence.</i>

40:12.280 --> 40:14.272
<i>He's a hit man.</i>

40:18.200 --> 40:19.714
Jesus, Harrison!

40:19.960 --> 40:21.519
Look at what you did!

40:25.400 --> 40:27.869
Uh, I'm sorry.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.311
It's okay. I'm sorry I yelled.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.318
It's okay.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.398
Just give me a second.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.392
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

40:43.600 --> 40:46.240
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

40:50.560 --> 40:53.234
Come on. We're going.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.596
<i>If Deb is with Briggs
when El Sapo shows up,</i>

41:01.760 --> 41:02.910
<i>he might take her out as well.</i>

41:04.280 --> 41:06.875
<i>It's Joey Quinn. Thrill me.</i>

41:07.040 --> 41:09.032
Quinn, it's Dexter. Call me.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.559
The fuck!

41:24.120 --> 41:26.077
Yeah! I'm coming!

41:28.440 --> 41:29.999
The fuck?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.639
Hey. You brought the kid.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.995
What's going on?
You didn't answer your phone.

41:38.200 --> 41:42.399
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Well, I need to get ahold of Deb.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.354
And you need me for that, why?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.315
I don't know where she is.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.514
What do you mean, you don't know?
I just don't.

41:50.720 --> 41:54.111
Look, I know she's in Fort Lauderdale.
I need to know where she's staying.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.317
She talks to you.
Do you know where she is?

41:56.520 --> 41:59.797
Yeah, the last she mentioned
she was at this place, the Pink Motel.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.198
Some dump.
Thanks. Come on.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.037
Was that Dexter?

42:07.200 --> 42:08.793
Yeah. He was looking for Deb.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.394
Fucking strange.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.920
Hmm.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.160
I don't want to talk about that.
Come here.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.316
Mm.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.635
Oh, my God. Why is the
whole world against us?

42:21.840 --> 42:23.354
Ignore it.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.397
<i>This is Jamie Batista.
Please leave a message.</i>

42:33.560 --> 42:34.710
Jesus.

42:34.880 --> 42:38.032
Doesn't anybody answer
their fucking phone?

42:38.240 --> 42:42.200
We're going for a drive.
Okay, Daddy.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.477
<i>It's Deb. Leave a message.</i>

43:24.680 --> 43:27.115
<i>The user's mailbox is full.</i>

44:03.200 --> 44:05.635
What the fuck?
I told you to stay away from here.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.479
I know, but you're in danger.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.194
Someone is gonna kill Briggs.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.720
You need to come with me now.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.237
The fuck I do. Briggs is about to meet his fence.
I'm gonna make a fuckload of money.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.995
That's who's gonna shoot him. I'm
trying to keep you from getting shot too.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.271
That's bullshit.
No, it's not.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.039
El Sapo isn't a fence. He's a hit man.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.112
He's gonna get the jewels
and kill Briggs.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.715
I know you don't wanna see me,
but I had to tell you.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.037
All right, you told me.
It's very dangerous.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.038
I get that.
You need to come with me.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.675
You could die here.
I don't fucking care!

44:33.800 --> 44:35.280
Deb.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.434
What?

44:38.800 --> 44:42.555
What, aren't you the one always saying
that bad people deserve to die?

44:43.080 --> 44:45.515
You're not a bad person.
I killed LaGuerta.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.518
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?

44:47.720 --> 44:49.951
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
it doesn't matter!

44:50.200 --> 44:52.271
That's not what I meant! Come on!

44:52.480 --> 44:54.836
Deb, it's been months of this.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.719
You can't keep me away forever.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.989
You don't understand anything,
do you?

45:03.360 --> 45:04.510
I wake up every day,

45:04.760 --> 45:08.037
thinking of every bad decision
that I ever made because of you.

45:08.240 --> 45:11.438
And it kills me
that I can't take any of it back.

45:12.960 --> 45:13.996
I'm sorry.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.874
Don't fucking make that face
and say "I'm sorry" to me.

45:19.080 --> 45:22.278
Even if it were fucking true,
it wouldn't make any difference.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.791
Because we can't undo any of it.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.670
So why don't you go back to your little
life and pretend everything's fine

45:28.840 --> 45:32.470
but I can't do that
because I am not fucking like you!

45:34.120 --> 45:35.270
We can talk about this later,

45:35.440 --> 45:37.432
but you need to come--
No, we fucking can't.

45:45.600 --> 45:47.398
You again?

45:51.880 --> 45:55.430
Let's go.
Asshole, get your hands off her.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.310
What the fuck?

46:08.360 --> 46:10.113
What did you do?

46:18.640 --> 46:21.235
I felt okay around him.

46:21.920 --> 46:23.400
You didn't belong with him.

46:23.640 --> 46:26.109
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
Deb--

46:26.400 --> 46:28.676
Will you fucking go? Will you go?

46:28.880 --> 46:30.280
Please go.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.755
I came here to save you.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.280
No...

46:33.800 --> 46:36.793
Deb, look at yourself. You're lost.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.839
I am not lost.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.634
I know exactly where I am.

46:44.840 --> 46:48.277
I am in some shitty fucking hell,
which is exactly what I deserve.

46:48.480 --> 46:49.960
But you...

46:50.320 --> 46:53.552
You are lost.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.960
All my life, I thought I needed you.

47:00.120 --> 47:03.511
That I couldn't survive without you.
Fuck. Fuck.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.030
It was the other fucking way around.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.436
It was the other way around.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.234
Deb--
Fucking go.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.038
Don't-- I'll get rid of the body.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.711
No, don't you fucking do anything,
all right? I'm gonna handle this.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.553
But if El Sapo comes, he's a hit man--
He has no clue who I am.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.877
If he comes and sees--
Would you fucking go?

47:27.080 --> 47:28.753
I'm gonna call this in.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.475
The police?
Yes.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.478
You should go.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.677
I'd like to report
a suspected homicide.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.119
Go.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.235
The Pink Motel in Broward.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.710
Oh, fuck.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.112
Harrison? Harrison?

48:20.400 --> 48:22.551
Harrison! Harrison!

48:24.040 --> 48:25.315
Daddy?

48:27.920 --> 48:30.879
Come here, buddy. Oh.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.037
I couldn't find you.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.030
I'm here, buddy. I'm right here.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.316
Where are we, Daddy?

48:42.320 --> 48:43.959
<i>Lost.</i>

48:47.640 --> 48:49.996
So you work
for Elway Investigations.

48:50.200 --> 48:53.318
Did a skip trace on Briggs,
you went out for a sandwich,

48:53.520 --> 48:56.274
and you found him dead
when you got back.

48:56.440 --> 48:57.635
That's it.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.071
Any idea who
might want to kill him?

49:01.480 --> 49:02.880
No.

49:03.720 --> 49:06.315
We'll call you
if we have any more questions.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.836
Elway, I've got a good news,
bad news situation here.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.596
Briggs is dead, but I think I have a lead
on where the jewellery might be

49:29.760 --> 49:31.991
so we might have a shot
at coming out ahead

49:32.200 --> 49:35.637
but I'm gonna talk to you about it
when I get to the office, okay? Bye.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.839
Mm.

50:10.120 --> 50:13.192
<i>Debra was right. I was wrong.</i>

50:13.400 --> 50:15.312
<i>It's me who's lost.</i>

50:15.960 --> 50:18.873
<i>A better person would let her go.
But I don't know how.</i>

50:24.280 --> 50:28.479
<i>Without her,
I don't know who I am anymore.</i>

50:46.000 --> 50:47.719
Dexter?

50:50.240 --> 50:52.357
This isn't a good time.

50:54.360 --> 50:57.273
I was hoping
to share something with you.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.592
I told you I'm not in the mood
for this.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.878
Well, then maybe I can
just leave this with you.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.155
Dexter, please.
What is it you want?

51:41.320 --> 51:43.630
Please let go.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.871
You can't kill me.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.434
Why?

51:50.640 --> 51:53.792
Because I don't fit Harry's code.
