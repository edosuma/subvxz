That's all I needed
to hear, little filly.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.929
<i>Cheese: Just a little</i>
<i>memento of my visit.</i>

21:07.499 --> 21:11.302
<i>You're giving me your special</i>
<i>rubber chicken friend?</i>

21:11.304 --> 21:12.937
Oh, he's not the only one.

21:14.806 --> 21:18.843
Well, boneless two,
another job well done.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.779
But it's time we mosey along.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.048
Another town, another party.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.787
I never did get
that pony's name.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.389
All: Cheese sandwich!

21:31.391 --> 21:32.456
<i>(giggling)</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:35.526
Oh yeah!
