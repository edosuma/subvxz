WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:04.520
- Hey, look, this is
to your last week as a free man.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.050
All: Booyah!

00:06.060 --> 00:07.760
- Why don't I just give you guys
the bottle?

00:07.760 --> 00:10.260
- Sounds good to me.
- Works for me, dad.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.090
- Hey, whoa.
- Whoa.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.360
- Hey, Mr. Nichols,
trev told us you were in

00:13.360 --> 00:14.560
'nam back in the day.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.800
- Smack in the middle
of primetime, 1968.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.500
- Man, that must've been rough.
- Yeah.

00:18.970 --> 00:22.240
Let me tell you squids a story.
- Oh, not that old Chestnut.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.980
- Now, we were on recon.
It was raining so hard

00:24.980 --> 00:27.010
we couldn't see five feet
in front of us.

00:27.010 --> 00:29.910
I stepped in a bed
of bamboo vipers.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.250
One of them gets me by the leg.
I grab my k-bar

00:32.250 --> 00:33.780
and I cut
the damn snake's head off.

00:33.790 --> 00:35.790
- No way.
- Not only that.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.890
Little bastard's been
holding up my pants ever since.

00:38.890 --> 00:41.060
That's nice.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.660
- Have a round with us, dad,
before we head out on the town.

00:43.660 --> 00:46.700
- All right.
To wives and sweethearts.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.800
May they never meet.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.640
- Never.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.910
<i>- I told Trevor to be outside
at 0600.</i>

00:57.910 --> 01:00.010
- Well...

01:00.010 --> 01:03.050
We don't get on the road soon,
we're not gonna get our blind.

01:21.030 --> 01:22.830
Trevor?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.100
Trev?

01:33.050 --> 01:34.680
Oh, god!

01:39.050 --> 01:41.020
Mike! Jake!

01:44.020 --> 01:45.620
- Oh, my god.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.130
- My son. He's dead.

01:48.130 --> 01:49.090
- Get him out of here.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.160
- Come on!

01:51.160 --> 01:52.930
- Mr. Nichols, come on.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.130
- We came in for trev's
bachelor party.

01:55.130 --> 01:58.100
We're staying at an airbnb
a few blocks away from here.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.810
- We were supposed
to go deer hunting today.

02:00.810 --> 02:03.640
- Trevor's dad
went inside the house...

02:03.640 --> 02:05.110
And he found him there.

02:05.110 --> 02:07.850
- Is his dad still here?

02:07.850 --> 02:09.680
- No. He went home
to tell his wife.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.050
- Thanks. Stay close.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.150
- Got the call
about an hour ago.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.960
Saw the lock on the back door
was jimmied.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.400
- Did you happen to see
a murder weapon?

02:24.500 --> 02:27.130
- No, but there's a knife
missing from the butcher block.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.840
- Hey, drummond.
- Dawson.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.810
- There's a tan line. No watch.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.010
- Find a wallet anywhere?

02:37.010 --> 02:38.810
- I haven't checked his pockets
yet.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.650
- Ooh.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.990
Hmm.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.700
- We braced ourself for this day

02:59.700 --> 03:03.030
when Trevor was deployed
overseas.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.140
But we never thought that...

03:06.810 --> 03:11.040
- How long has your son
been out of the Navy?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.740
- 18 months.

03:12.750 --> 03:16.710
He enlisted the day he graduated
from high school.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.320
He was in ten years.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.690
He had an honorable discharge.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.360
- And since then?

03:25.360 --> 03:27.060
- He was a personal trainer
at one of those ritzy gyms.

03:27.060 --> 03:30.730
He wasn't getting rich,
but he looked forward

03:30.730 --> 03:32.230
to going to work every day.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.470
- His wedding was next Saturday.

03:34.470 --> 03:37.070
Instead we're planning
a funeral.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.710
- It's not much consolation,

03:41.710 --> 03:44.410
but I have
our best people on it.

03:44.410 --> 03:46.810
- You damn well better.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.820
- I just can't believe
trev's gone, just like that.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.290
It's so unfair.

03:57.290 --> 03:59.090
- When was the last time
you saw him?

03:59.090 --> 04:01.160
- We had dinner Thursday.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.460
- Things were good
between you two?

04:02.460 --> 04:05.030
- We were about to get married.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.330
Trev was really looking forward
to the wedding,

04:07.330 --> 04:10.400
partying with all of our friends
and families.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.170
- Right before I got married,
I freaked out a little.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.370
I almost had a fling...
- trev wasn't like that, okay?

04:16.380 --> 04:18.180
- I hate to bother you
with this, Mia,

04:18.180 --> 04:20.040
but we found these
at Trevor's house.

04:20.050 --> 04:22.150
I just want to confirm
that they're yours.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.460
- No, they're not.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.790
I mean, they must have
been there from before we met.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.900
- You're probably right.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.500
- It's unbelievable.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.900
Four tours,
and Trevor gets killed

04:41.900 --> 04:43.800
in his own place in Chicago.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.470
- What'd you guys do
for your big night out?

04:45.470 --> 04:47.840
- We started at Trevor's place
for beers.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.070
- We had drinks
with Mr. Nichols at his bar,

04:50.080 --> 04:52.080
and after that went
to some joint

04:52.080 --> 04:53.480
where all the waitresses wear
bikinis.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.310
- Big Mel's bikini bar?
- Yeah.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.220
That's the place.

04:59.220 --> 05:03.250
- Trevor got hammered,
and this waitress hit on him.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.420
- Angela.
Total smokeshow.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.560
Sorry, ma'am, she was on him
like honey on a hot biscuit.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.430
- Was Trevor into her?
- Yeah.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.330
- Oh, yeah,
he said he was gonna hang around

05:13.330 --> 05:16.530
till Angela got off of work,
so me and Mike bounced.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.300
- You left your friend that was
about to get married

05:18.300 --> 05:20.500
with miss smokeshow?

05:20.510 --> 05:22.240
Some wingmen.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.560
- we'd like to speak to big Mel.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
What can I do you for?

05:40.560 --> 05:43.190
- We're looking for Angela.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.200
- The girl in the yellow bikini.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.900
- The sex on the beach
is pretty sweet.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.970
The climax is very popular.

05:50.970 --> 05:53.870
But my all-time fave
is the ménage à trois.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.540
- Angela, come on.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.310
Come on.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.480
- How's it going, Angela?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.350
- I'll let you know.
What's up?

06:04.350 --> 06:06.150
- What did you do after work
last night?

06:06.150 --> 06:09.290
- Went home.
- With him?

06:09.290 --> 06:10.990
- Alone.

06:10.990 --> 06:14.390
- So, how did your underwear
wind up in his pocket?

06:14.390 --> 06:16.630
- Did something happen to him?

06:16.630 --> 06:19.200
- You know what cops
call panties?

06:19.200 --> 06:20.530
Lie detectors.

06:20.530 --> 06:24.470
Hairs, fluids,
and lots and lots of DNA.

06:24.470 --> 06:27.300
- He was getting married.
His buddies tipped me 50 bucks

06:27.310 --> 06:29.570
to slip him my thong.
- And that's all?

06:29.580 --> 06:31.580
- Trevor wanted to hang out
after I got off of work,

06:31.580 --> 06:33.540
so I took him to a fight club.

06:33.550 --> 06:35.350
- The one in humboldt park
on le moyne?

06:35.350 --> 06:37.880
- That's right. I thought
he just wanted to watch,

06:37.880 --> 06:39.580
but once we got there,
he said he wanted to fight,

06:39.590 --> 06:41.490
so they set up a match for him.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.450
He kicked some dude's ass.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.260
I wasn't planning to hook up
with him,

06:48.260 --> 06:51.460
but after he took his shirt off
and dominated in the ring,

06:51.460 --> 06:53.460
I was like, "come to mama."

06:53.470 --> 06:54.600
- Seriously?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.000
- You should've seen him.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.470
- I did. In a body bag.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.570
- That's...

07:01.670 --> 07:04.440
Wow.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.540
- So, what happened
when you left the fight club?

07:07.550 --> 07:10.480
- We got in an uber,
started making out,

07:10.480 --> 07:13.550
and then he got all weird,

07:13.550 --> 07:16.450
said he didn't want to screw
things up with his fiancée.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.520
So I dropped him off.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.990
- And then?
- I went home.

07:23.330 --> 07:25.630
And took the edge off,
lady-style.

07:25.630 --> 07:28.670
Adele, a glass of amaro,
and the happy rabbit.

07:31.970 --> 07:34.070
- Uber driver confirms
Angela's story.

07:34.070 --> 07:37.010
She never got out of the car.

07:37.010 --> 07:38.540
Stone.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.240
Prelim autopsy's back.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.550
We need to meet him
at the morgue.

07:42.550 --> 07:46.680
- Penetrating knife wound
to the left femoral artery

07:46.690 --> 07:49.020
did most of the damage.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.520
- Most?
- Bruising and edema

07:51.520 --> 07:53.590
to his face, arms, and torso.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.290
He put up a hell of a fight.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.060
- Two, actually.
The first one for cash,

07:57.060 --> 07:58.460
the second one for his life.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.400
- Blood alcohol was .23.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.530
I'm sure he wasn't
on top of his game.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.740
- So, an intoxicated,
unarmed man was overmatched

08:04.740 --> 08:06.400
by a knife-wielding assailant?

08:06.410 --> 08:09.570
- There's just one anomaly.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.540
Check out the X-ray.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.610
- What's that in his stomach?

08:13.610 --> 08:15.410
- Based on my analysis,
looks to me

08:15.410 --> 08:17.750
like a computer thumb drive.

08:27.990 --> 08:31.130
- There was no corrosion
from digestive agents.

08:31.130 --> 08:33.429
The me is sure he ingested it
right before he died.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.429
- I doubt it accidentally fell
into his corn flakes.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.230
- If he swallowed it
at the time of the break-in,

08:37.240 --> 08:39.539
maybe he was trying to hide it
from whoever killed him.

08:44.010 --> 08:47.180
- I can read the drive,
but I can't get in.

08:47.180 --> 08:49.110
- Password protected?
- It's a video file,

08:49.120 --> 08:51.150
but it's encrypted up the wazoo.

08:51.150 --> 08:52.680
- Something you can handle?

08:52.690 --> 08:55.050
- This is NSA-level cloaking.

08:55.050 --> 08:57.290
We farm it out to the private
sector, maybe we'll get lucky.

08:57.290 --> 09:00.420
- This was no run-of-the-mill
home invasion.

09:00.430 --> 09:02.260
Let's find out
what Trevor Nichols was hiding

09:02.260 --> 09:04.330
the old-fashioned way.

09:07.270 --> 09:09.130
- Trevor was first team,
all-city tight end.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.300
That's not too shabby.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.070
- Yeah, this guy was still
in great shape.

09:14.070 --> 09:16.270
How did someone get the jump
on him?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.780
- Passed out from too many
tequilas, intruder with a knife?

09:18.780 --> 09:20.380
I don't like his chances.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.800
Electric bill,

09:37.800 --> 09:40.830
junk mail
from bucktown savings bank.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.200
When was the last time
anybody actually got a letter?

09:43.200 --> 09:46.200
- Let me see the bank one.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.540
- You can't open
a dead man's mail.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.370
- You're probably right.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.510
Let's see. Let's see.

09:57.120 --> 10:02.190
"With your average monthly
balance of $250,000, you qualify

10:02.190 --> 10:05.190
for a bucktown savings
personal wealth account."

10:05.190 --> 10:07.220
- How does a Navy vet
turned personal trainer

10:07.230 --> 10:09.090
make that kind of bank?

10:09.100 --> 10:12.160
- His fiancée was rocking
a pretty hefty diamond.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.340
- Trevor picked it out.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.500
- Looks expensive.

10:20.510 --> 10:25.280
- It was. I think trev was
trying to prove a point.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.880
- What do you mean?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.380
- Well, Mike really blew
his chance with me,

10:29.380 --> 10:32.280
so I think trev was trying
to convince me

10:32.280 --> 10:34.520
he was serious
about getting married.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.590
- You went out with Mike soto?

10:36.590 --> 10:39.420
- For about eight months.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.460
That was before I moved
to Chicago to be near Trevor.

10:44.130 --> 10:48.400
With over a quarter of a million
dollars in it?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.470
- Where did all that money
come from?

10:52.470 --> 10:54.140
- I... i don't know.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.170
His dad gave it to him?

10:56.180 --> 10:58.180
- Mia, Trevor was murdered.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.480
Now's not the time
to keep secrets.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.280
- Fine. Um...

11:07.290 --> 11:09.150
Trev was writing a book,

11:09.160 --> 11:11.290
and they gave him
a bunch of money up front.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.860
He told me not to tell anyone,

11:13.860 --> 11:16.360
but I guess that doesn't
really matter now.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.930
- What was his book about?

11:18.930 --> 11:21.170
- Something about being
in the Navy.

11:21.170 --> 11:24.870
What do they call it?
Oh, a memoir.

11:24.870 --> 11:27.170
I'm really sorry,
but I need to leave now,

11:27.170 --> 11:29.510
or I'm gonna be late
for Trevor's service.

11:29.510 --> 11:31.280
- Okay.

11:43.490 --> 11:46.390
- Mr. jefferies.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

11:46.390 --> 11:49.190
- I know how busy you must be.
This is quite an honor.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.700
- Or maybe you're just here
looking for votes.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.200
- Vets are paid a lot of
lip service these days, ma'am.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.330
It's the least I can do.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.240
- Were you in the service?

11:59.240 --> 12:03.270
- Yes, ma'am.
I was in the corps, Vietnam.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.380
- No kidding.
Brown-water Navy.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.380
My tho river.

12:11.550 --> 12:12.920
- I wouldn't have made it
through boot camp

12:12.920 --> 12:15.320
without Trevor.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.220
I was terrible at ironing.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.620
You know, seriously,
they were gonna discharge me

12:20.630 --> 12:24.360
for inability to properly
maintain my uniform.

12:26.500 --> 12:30.730
One morning, I woke up,
and trev had ironed

12:30.740 --> 12:35.270
every article of clothing
in my locker,

12:35.270 --> 12:37.370
even my skivvies.

12:40.580 --> 12:44.510
I asked him why, he said...

12:44.520 --> 12:47.250
"Because I got your back, bro."

12:50.290 --> 12:53.990
- Trevor's publisher says
his book advance was $400,000.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.660
- Whew. Damn.
Maybe I should write a book.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.500
- Heh. All of a sudden
you have literary aspirations.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.030
- What can I say?
I'm a renaissance man.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.330
How much of this book
did Trevor actually write?

13:04.340 --> 13:06.040
Three chapters.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.300
- Don't you need approval
from the Navy

13:07.310 --> 13:08.740
to publish something like that?

13:08.740 --> 13:11.410
- She says their lawyer
signed off on it.

13:11.410 --> 13:13.280
- Be nice to see those chapters.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.480
Apparently Trevor
was paranoid about plagiarism.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.320
- They decrypted the video.

13:22.690 --> 13:26.320
<i>- Left clear.
- Right clear.</i>

13:26.330 --> 13:28.030
- Looks like it's shot
with a helmet cam.

13:28.030 --> 13:30.060
- State-of-the-art
night vision scopes.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.300
M4 assault rifles. I'm
pretty sure that's a seal team.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.730
<i>- Hold.
- Contact. Two o'clock.</i>

13:40.740 --> 13:43.040
<i>- Room clear.</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:52.420
<i>Oh, god.</i>

13:54.720 --> 13:58.360
<i>Is she all right?
Is she alive?</i>

13:59.690 --> 14:01.390
<i>- O'brien down.</i>

14:06.660 --> 14:08.070
<i>- Ramirez down.</i>

14:08.070 --> 14:10.600
<i>- Contact. East wall.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:12.740
<i>Gotta get Mike.</i>

14:12.740 --> 14:14.670
<i>- Get his legs!</i>

14:14.670 --> 14:17.040
<i>Come on!
Abort!</i>

14:17.040 --> 14:19.610
<i>Abort!
- Abort! Abort!</i>

14:19.610 --> 14:21.850
<i>- Act calmly.
- Oh, god.</i>

14:21.850 --> 14:25.520
<i>- Come on, we gotta go.
Leave her. Let's go.</i>

14:25.520 --> 14:28.490
<i>Let's go! Come on!
She's gone! Let's go!</i>

14:28.490 --> 14:30.690
<i>Let's go!</i>

14:34.090 --> 14:37.430
- What the hell was that?

14:37.430 --> 14:39.360
- Something we weren't supposed
to see.

14:43.770 --> 14:49.370
When things got too dangerous
for humanitarian workers,

14:49.380 --> 14:50.910
they pulled their people out.

14:50.910 --> 14:54.110
But Dr. Carter refused
to leave her patients.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.780
One week later,
she was kidnapped

14:55.780 --> 14:57.750
by a separatist faction,

14:57.750 --> 14:59.980
so the Navy sent in a seal team
to rescue her.

14:59.990 --> 15:02.420
It was called operation omega.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.720
- This was all over the news
a couple years ago.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.760
- According to the Pentagon,
the mission went awry.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.030
Dr. Carter and two of the seals
were killed by the rebels.

15:09.030 --> 15:12.900
- But on that video, it was one
of the Americans who shot her

15:12.900 --> 15:14.100
and left her body there.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.770
- Now, that's a memoir
I'd want to read.

15:15.770 --> 15:17.000
- Let's find out
if Trevor Nichols was

15:17.000 --> 15:18.840
one of those seals.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.870
- Come in. Come in.
- Thank you.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.840
- Are you any closer to finding
out whoever killed my son?

15:26.850 --> 15:30.080
- We're making some progress.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.120
- I'm sorry. Please.

15:37.490 --> 15:40.790
- Did you and Trevor talk much
about his time in the Navy?

15:40.790 --> 15:43.730
- No, not much.
- What about his book?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.900
- What book?
- His publisher said...

15:45.900 --> 15:50.670
- She said his book was about
his time in naval intelligence.

15:50.670 --> 15:53.140
- He wasn't intel.
He was a seal.

15:53.140 --> 15:57.140
- Mm. He was one of the seals
who survived operation omega.

15:57.140 --> 15:59.010
- How'd you know that?

15:59.010 --> 16:01.210
- It came up
in our investigation.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.750
Trevor's Navy buddies Mike soto
and Jake Benjamin...

16:04.750 --> 16:06.080
They were in his seal unit?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.790
- That's right.
Jake was their team leader.

16:08.790 --> 16:11.960
- Did Trevor talk to anyone
about what happened over there?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.190
- No. I tried to talk to him
about it once,

16:14.190 --> 16:16.730
but he just waved me off.

16:16.730 --> 16:18.530
He did make a visit
to the family

16:18.530 --> 16:20.960
of the doctor that was killed
by the rebels.

16:20.970 --> 16:26.240
He and Jake made a condolence
visit to the family in Iowa.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.570
When he got back, he was
pretty shook up about it.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.950
- Trevor didn't even
tell his father the truth

16:35.950 --> 16:37.950
about how Dr. Carter died.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.720
- It would be nice to know
what he told the Carter family.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.950
- Any reason to suspect them?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.160
- Well, the seal team did
get their daughter killed.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.790
- They live in Iowa.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.960
Let's see if they'll come in
for a chat.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.530
- When the charity called
and told her

16:50.530 --> 16:52.000
to get out of the Ukraine,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.130
she couldn't just abandon
those poor people.

16:55.130 --> 16:58.070
- They wanted
a $5 million ransom.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.870
Can you imagine?

16:59.870 --> 17:01.570
I mean,
we have a ten-year-old pickup.

17:01.570 --> 17:03.870
- Were any of you in Chicago
last week?

17:03.880 --> 17:06.540
- No, no.
This is our first time.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.280
- We heard the seals
who tried to rescue Kathryn

17:08.280 --> 17:09.780
paid you a visit.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.150
- Yes, they did.
Two of them, anyway.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.220
- They felt so terrible
about what happened.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.250
The one in charge told us
that they almost had Kathy

17:17.260 --> 17:18.560
safe at the helicopter

17:18.560 --> 17:21.560
when the enemy soldiers
opened fire.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.190
- We tried to thank them,
but we could tell

17:23.200 --> 17:24.790
they still felt bad about it.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.300
- Yeah, and the younger one...
What was his name?

17:26.300 --> 17:28.200
Trevor, I think.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.900
He was so upset
he had to go sit in the car.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.300
- I saw him out the window.
It looked like he was crying.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.040
- Was he the one
who was murdered?

17:36.040 --> 17:37.770
- Yes. I'm afraid so.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.310
- Tell them about the check,
mom.

17:39.310 --> 17:42.950
- Oh, um...

17:42.950 --> 17:44.310
Yeah.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.280
About a month ago,
this came in the mail.

17:48.820 --> 17:51.960
- Cashier's check
from bucktown savings.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.320
$100,000.

17:53.330 --> 17:54.930
- We don't know
where it came from,

17:54.930 --> 17:57.030
so we didn't feel right
taking the money.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.900
- Trevor sent the Carters
part of his advance.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.070
But he didn't tell them
the seals killed their daughter.

18:04.070 --> 18:08.340
Maybe he was about to blow
the lid off operation omega,

18:08.340 --> 18:11.170
and he couldn't take all that
money with a clear conscience.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.080
- I doubt his fellow seals
wanted the world to know.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.910
Dr. Carter was killed
by friendly fire.

18:14.910 --> 18:18.650
- They were both in Chicago
the night Trevor was murdered.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.580
- Have Dawson and nagel dig in.

18:20.590 --> 18:22.890
Tell them to start
with the airbnb.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.590
- You know,
I don't always meet the guests

18:26.590 --> 18:27.920
that stay at my properties,

18:27.930 --> 18:30.160
but these two young men
were very polite.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.360
They had to extend their stay
for a funeral... poor things.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.300
And I know it was
a little cramped in here.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.970
When they first got here,
I tried to move them

18:38.970 --> 18:40.340
to the big two-bedroom upstairs,

18:40.340 --> 18:42.370
but they said they wanted
the fireplace.

18:44.140 --> 18:46.940
I told them this weather
is nothing.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.310
Wait till it's ten below.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.620
- This doesn't look
like wood ash.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.060
- It's a rivet
from a pair of jeans.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.230
And two zippers.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.330
- Why were they burning
their clothes?

19:09.330 --> 19:11.130
- Do you know
when these guys left?

19:11.140 --> 19:12.670
- Just before you got here.

19:12.670 --> 19:15.010
They're headed to midway
to fly home.

19:15.010 --> 19:16.940
I told them to walk to Wells

19:16.940 --> 19:19.010
and catch the orange line.

19:25.020 --> 19:28.250
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

19:30.260 --> 19:35.090
- you do realize it's you and me
against two Navy seals, right?

19:35.090 --> 19:37.190
- Element of surprise, nagel.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.060
- Yeah.
No problem whatsoever.

19:41.370 --> 19:43.670
- All right, go that way.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.740
- Go ahead!

20:07.360 --> 20:10.390
- move! Police!
Everybody down!

20:10.400 --> 20:11.460
Move!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.330
Get back!

20:14.330 --> 20:15.730
Move!

20:18.200 --> 20:21.400
- Whoa! Freeze!

20:21.410 --> 20:24.310
You're both under arrest for
the murder of Trevor Nichols.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.220
- The zippers recovered
from the defendants' fireplace

20:34.220 --> 20:36.420
were from Navy-issued
tactical fleeces.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.150
The only logical conclusion is

20:38.160 --> 20:39.990
that the defendants burned
their bloody clothing

20:39.990 --> 20:42.030
after stabbing Trevor Nichols
to death.

20:42.030 --> 20:45.260
The people request no bail.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.500
- My clients
are decorated Navy vets

20:47.500 --> 20:49.370
who have served our nation
with valor.

20:49.370 --> 20:52.040
They have the utmost respect
for its laws.

20:52.040 --> 20:55.000
I only ask as they face
these dubious charges

20:55.010 --> 20:56.440
they enjoy the same freedom

20:56.440 --> 20:58.480
they've risked their lives
to protect.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.010
- I almost heard a fife and drum
there, Mr. Olson.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.410
First time in cook county?

21:03.420 --> 21:06.050
- Yes, sir, but I've represented
men in uniform

21:06.050 --> 21:07.380
across this great country.

21:07.390 --> 21:09.150
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
but men in uniform are

21:09.150 --> 21:10.490
men who've been trained to kill.

21:10.490 --> 21:12.790
- In war, sir.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.490
- One can only hope.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.530
Bail is set
at $1 million d bond...

21:16.530 --> 21:18.360
- that's an insult
to these patriots.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.430
- Let me finish.

21:19.430 --> 21:21.330
From the bottom of my heart,

21:21.330 --> 21:25.370
I want to thank you
for your service, gentleman.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.240
Bail's still a million smackers.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.440
Call the next case.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.310
- Hang tight, guys.
Nothing to worry about.

21:32.310 --> 21:34.280
You seem rather confident
about a case

21:34.280 --> 21:36.180
that's purely circumstantial.

21:36.180 --> 21:38.080
Where's your motive?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.820
- Ask your clients.

21:42.550 --> 21:45.160
- What did you make of Olson?

21:45.160 --> 21:47.360
- His flag-waving will play
a lot better with the jury

21:47.360 --> 21:51.260
- I don't know, Peter.
That "god and country" routine...

21:51.260 --> 21:52.400
Sometimes my eyes glaze over.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.870
- Careful.
We have a vet upstairs.

21:55.870 --> 21:58.100
- Do you think soto and Benjamin
will tell their lawyer

21:58.100 --> 22:00.140
about operation omega?

22:00.140 --> 22:04.240
If Olson comes in begging
for a plea deal, he knows.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.410
If he wets his khakis when we
screen the video for him, he...

22:06.410 --> 22:08.310
- Peter stone?

22:08.310 --> 22:10.250
- That's right.
- We're seeking to enforce

22:10.250 --> 22:12.420
a writ of replevin
against you and your office.

22:12.420 --> 22:13.580
- Nice to meet you, too.

22:13.590 --> 22:16.050
- Mary graziano.
U.S. department of justice,

22:16.050 --> 22:17.350
national security division.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.590
Since law school.
What's this all about?

22:20.590 --> 22:23.460
That belongs
to the United States government.

22:23.460 --> 22:24.860
We want it back.

22:24.860 --> 22:27.060
See you in federal court
tomorrow, Mr. stone,

22:27.070 --> 22:28.530
bright and early.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.510
- How did the DOJ find out
you had this video?

22:40.510 --> 22:42.880
- My money's on an employee
in the tech company

22:42.880 --> 22:44.580
that did the decryption for us.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.920
- Not that it matters
at this point.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.950
- It matters to me.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.090
Maybe you should've been the one
to tell them.

22:52.090 --> 22:54.090
Is the government aware
that this footage is.

22:54.090 --> 22:57.060
- It seems that way.
What's unclear is

22:57.060 --> 22:59.560
whether they know the seal team
botched the mission.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.130
- So, this could come as a shock
to the powers that be.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.300
- Or a leak. And a cover-up
that began two years ago.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.570
- You think the Navy spun
the story that went public?

23:07.570 --> 23:09.210
- As opposed
to an honest mistake?

23:09.210 --> 23:11.110
- That sounds pretty cynical,
Peter.

23:11.110 --> 23:14.110
- Weapons of mass destruction,
Iran-contra, the Gulf of tonkin.

23:14.110 --> 23:16.150
- Those names should be
a warning to you.

23:16.150 --> 23:19.020
You've stepped into something
way bigger than your pay grade.

23:19.020 --> 23:21.280
- I do like to hear the truth
from my public officials,

23:21.290 --> 23:23.120
but I don't have
an axe to grind here.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.220
- Really?
Because I see sparks flying.

23:25.220 --> 23:28.060
- I just want to be able
to prove my murder case.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.560
- You're litigating
against the justice department

23:30.560 --> 23:32.960
in federal court.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.100
If your murder case hangs
on this video,

23:35.100 --> 23:37.130
lots of luck.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.970
- Thanks for the pep talk, boss.

23:45.010 --> 23:46.310
- The video in question
was recorded

23:46.310 --> 23:47.940
by an active duty sailor.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.150
It's property of the Navy.

23:49.150 --> 23:51.110
Neither Mr. stone
nor his co-council have

23:51.120 --> 23:53.250
the necessary security clearance
to watch this video,

23:53.250 --> 23:54.580
much less possess it.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.550
- We can't put the rain
back in the sky.

23:56.550 --> 23:58.190
We didn't have any inkling
of its contents

23:58.190 --> 23:59.990
before we watched it.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.990
For all we knew, it could've
been a "three stooges" clip.

24:01.990 --> 24:04.930
But for the fact this video
contradicts

24:04.930 --> 24:07.000
the official statements
about operation omega.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.260
It could embarrass
the executive branch

24:08.270 --> 24:10.230
and have repercussions
on our foreign policy.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.170
- So, let me propose
a simple remedy:

24:12.170 --> 24:16.040
Mr. stone, hand over the video,
destroy all copies,

24:16.040 --> 24:19.140
- But this video is
a critical piece of evidence

24:19.140 --> 24:21.110
in a homicide case.
- How so?

24:21.110 --> 24:23.010
- The victim was
a former Navy seal.

24:23.010 --> 24:25.680
He was murdered to prevent
him writing.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.150
Once I introduce the video
into evidence, it's all yours.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.120
- And by the following morning,
the story will be click-bait

24:32.120 --> 24:34.620
for every media outlet
from here to vladivostok.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.630
- Would you concede, Mr. stone,
there are more important

24:36.630 --> 24:38.260
national concerns at stake here

24:38.260 --> 24:40.100
than one local murder case?

24:43.330 --> 24:45.130
- Here's one:

24:45.140 --> 24:48.670
About what our military does
in foreign lands.

24:48.670 --> 24:51.740
Transparency breeds trust
in our institutions.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.110
And this federal judiciary has
courageously upheld these values

24:55.110 --> 24:57.180
in turbulent times...
Watergate, the Pentagon papers...

24:57.180 --> 24:59.250
- with all due respect
to Mr. stone,

24:59.250 --> 25:01.650
if we start allowing local
officials to become the arbiters

25:01.650 --> 25:03.720
of whether classified items
are made public,

25:03.720 --> 25:05.190
that's a national security
nightmare

25:05.190 --> 25:06.320
I can't begin to imagine.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.290
- I see your point,
Ms. graziano.

25:08.290 --> 25:10.430
Thank you both
for your thoughtful arguments.

25:10.430 --> 25:12.260
You'll have my decision
tomorrow.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.130
- So, you think we have a shot?

25:18.140 --> 25:20.200
- Oh, I'm not that optimistic.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.640
The DOJ has
home court advantage.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.110
- Peter killed it in court,
though.

25:24.110 --> 25:26.180
I was ready to bust out
into "masters of war."

25:26.180 --> 25:28.640
- Don't recruit me for the
weather underground just yet.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.250
I said what I had to say
to try and get justice

25:30.250 --> 25:32.020
for Trevor Nichols
and his family.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.180
- You know,
if we lose the video,

25:33.180 --> 25:35.080
it wouldn't be
the end of the world.

25:35.090 --> 25:40.060
- Mike soto went out with Mia
until Trevor stole her away.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.090
Soto arrives
at the bachelor party.

25:42.090 --> 25:44.130
He's jealous.
He tries to use bikini girl.

25:44.130 --> 25:47.800
- And when that doesn't work,
soto confronts Trevor,

25:47.800 --> 25:50.100
things get out of hand.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.270
- It's not the best hand
at the table,

25:51.270 --> 25:54.140
but I'll play it if I have to.

25:55.810 --> 25:58.140
- The government asserts
a broad principle:

25:58.140 --> 26:01.210
National security
should always carry the day.

26:01.210 --> 26:04.780
Mr. stone has also made
a lofty claim:

26:04.780 --> 26:08.180
Honesty and transparency
are Paramount.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.750
So, let's look
at the fine print.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.820
Should the truth about
operation omega come to light,

26:13.830 --> 26:16.130
the government can point to
no individual

26:16.130 --> 26:19.160
who will be harmed,
no American soldier or sailor

26:19.160 --> 26:20.730
who will be endangered.

26:20.730 --> 26:22.670
On the other hand,
the people of Illinois will

26:22.670 --> 26:24.730
likely see two murderers
elude justice

26:24.740 --> 26:28.200
simply because the Navy
wants to perpetuate a lie.

26:28.210 --> 26:32.110
The government's application for
a writ of replevin is denied.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.680
- I got to say
I did not see that coming.

26:41.690 --> 26:44.390
- Chalk one up
for the underdogs.

26:44.390 --> 26:46.260
Good news.
The writ was denied.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.420
The video is in.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.790
- Except you're not
going to use it.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.160
- What?

26:53.160 --> 26:55.500
- You heard me.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
- Why?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.300
- Personal experience
has taught me

26:59.300 --> 27:02.170
military secrets
should stay secret.

27:02.170 --> 27:05.170
- With all due respect, just
because you served in Vietnam

27:05.180 --> 27:07.840
doesn't give you a monopoly
on national security protocol.

27:07.850 --> 27:10.850
- In my office, it does.

27:12.150 --> 27:13.720
When I walked into the jungle,

27:13.720 --> 27:16.190
I knew that as long as I stayed
on mission,

27:16.190 --> 27:17.890
the folks up the chain
of command had my back,

27:17.890 --> 27:20.190
and if there was something
that they wanted

27:20.190 --> 27:21.860
to keep out of the public eye,

27:21.860 --> 27:24.130
there was a damn good reason
for it.

27:24.130 --> 27:26.330
- There's never a good reason
to veil the truth.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.800
- Then why not open
your case files

27:28.800 --> 27:31.870
to every defense lawyer
you face?

27:31.870 --> 27:36.170
I'll tell you why not:
Because it's war.

27:36.170 --> 27:40.210
You do not give aid and comfort
to the enemy,

27:40.210 --> 27:42.510
unless you're a misguided fool
like Edward snowden.

27:42.510 --> 27:44.350
- I do not accept your analogy.

27:44.350 --> 27:46.780
- Then maybe
you can accept this:

27:46.780 --> 27:48.890
If you value your rights
and your freedoms,

27:48.890 --> 27:51.450
sometimes you have
to ask men and women

27:51.460 --> 27:55.560
to go to far-away battlefields
to die for them.

27:55.560 --> 27:59.230
And if you ask
your fellow Americans

27:59.230 --> 28:02.170
to risk their lives
for your liberties,

28:02.170 --> 28:04.370
then you don't get
to second-guess it all

28:04.370 --> 28:06.470
after the fact.

28:06.470 --> 28:08.940
- You realize this would
probably cost us our case.

28:08.940 --> 28:11.170
- I don't give a damn.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.950
- I do.

28:16.950 --> 28:19.350
I didn't come here to cling
to tired bromides

28:19.350 --> 28:21.420
that allow killers to go free.

28:21.420 --> 28:24.390
- Then you have a choice,
don't you?

28:24.390 --> 28:27.490
Do what I'm telling you,
or find a new job.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.770
- Mr. stone?

28:43.780 --> 28:46.840
- It's Peter.
Thanks for coming.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.480
- What's on your mind?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.780
- Came to pay my respects.

28:53.790 --> 28:57.590
- Could've done that
at the house.

28:57.590 --> 28:59.760
- There's also something
I thought you should know

28:59.760 --> 29:00.990
about Trevor.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.530
- If it's something
I'd rather not hear...

29:02.530 --> 29:07.800
- the Navy didn't tell you
the truth about omega.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.600
Trevor didn't either.

29:10.600 --> 29:14.640
- I'm sure there are things he
wanted to tell me but couldn't.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.540
- He was about to go public.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.440
He was gonna embarrass
a lot of people,

29:18.440 --> 29:19.810
including his friends,

29:19.810 --> 29:21.980
destroy careers, maybe.

29:21.980 --> 29:26.250
- So, that's
why you arrested Mike and Jake?

29:26.250 --> 29:29.550
- This secret the Navy kept
from you...

29:29.550 --> 29:31.950
From everybody,

29:31.960 --> 29:33.960
we can't reveal it
at their trial,

29:33.960 --> 29:36.630
so there's a strong likelihood
they won't be convicted.

29:39.830 --> 29:42.830
- I understand.

29:42.830 --> 29:45.970
- You do?

29:45.970 --> 29:49.570
- You never served, did you?

29:49.570 --> 29:51.740
My son joined up because he felt
there was a cause

29:51.740 --> 29:54.510
more important
than his own life.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.650
- Those ideals...
He came to realize they weren't

29:58.650 --> 29:59.920
all they were cracked up to be.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.650
- That's not how I see it.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.920
- He was writing a book that
defied his chain of command.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.630
- Every soldier needs a way to
let go of the weight he carries.

30:09.630 --> 30:12.930
Trevor found his way.

30:12.930 --> 30:16.630
Doesn't mean I have to agree
with it.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.700
- Do you even want to know
what it was gonna say?

30:18.700 --> 30:20.540
- No.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.670
I don't.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.560
- Peter?
- Bought you a coffee.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.360
Tall americano.

30:45.660 --> 30:46.960
- Thanks.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.070
- Tell me what you think
of this:

30:53.070 --> 30:55.100
There's no reason this video
has to go to the DOJ

30:55.110 --> 30:56.570
right this minute.

30:56.570 --> 31:00.580
- The defendants were present
when the video was shot,

31:00.580 --> 31:02.650
so there's no national security
issue when they watch it.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.010
- When?

31:04.020 --> 31:06.580
Jefferies won't let you put it
into evidence.

31:06.580 --> 31:09.650
- Mike soto doesn't know that.

31:09.650 --> 31:13.590
- I don't know.
Peter...

31:13.590 --> 31:15.120
Maybe it's better
just to let it go.

31:15.130 --> 31:18.360
- And let these two killers
walk away scot-free?

31:18.360 --> 31:22.800
Olson has a huge conflict
of interest.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.730
Let's divide and conquer.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.910
- Where'd you get that?

31:35.910 --> 31:38.780
- Let's not get hung up
on details.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.580
We know you and Jake Benjamin
killed Trevor Nichols.

31:41.590 --> 31:43.150
That explains why.

31:43.150 --> 31:44.850
If his book came out,
you'd be exposed

31:44.860 --> 31:46.990
as the screw-ups
who killed Dr. Carter

31:46.990 --> 31:49.160
and left her body
to god-knows-what indignity,

31:49.160 --> 31:54.100
they'll realize you had every
reason to kill your best friend

31:54.100 --> 31:56.670
and destroy his manuscript.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.730
The reason you're sitting here
instead of Mr. Benjamin

31:58.740 --> 32:01.000
is I'm pretty sure he was
calling the shots that night,

32:01.010 --> 32:04.610
like he did in the Ukraine.

32:04.610 --> 32:07.580
15 years
if you testify against him

32:07.580 --> 32:10.850
instead of the 60 to life you'll
get if you're convicted.

32:16.620 --> 32:20.020
- Mia skyped me a few months
before the bachelor weekend.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.630
She showed me the engagement
ring that Trevor bought her.

32:22.630 --> 32:25.190
I asked where Trevor got money
for a rock like that.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.860
She said he was being paid
to write a book.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.070
- What, if anything, did you do
with that information?

32:30.070 --> 32:32.070
- I called Jake.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.970
He and I both got so angry
about it,

32:34.970 --> 32:36.710
we just couldn't let it go.

32:36.710 --> 32:40.980
- We take a solemn pledge.
It's called the seal code:

32:40.980 --> 32:42.750
"I do not advertise
the nature of my work,

32:42.750 --> 32:46.780
nor seek recognition
for my actions."

32:46.780 --> 32:49.220
- And what did you decide to do
about Trevor's book?

32:49.220 --> 32:51.150
- Jake said that we had
to talk him out of it.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.020
- What if he wouldn't listen
to you?

32:53.020 --> 32:54.890
- Jake said
that wasn't an option.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.230
- What did you take that
to mean?

32:57.230 --> 32:58.890
- I wasn't sure.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.960
- What did you
take that to mean, Mr. soto?

33:03.170 --> 33:06.470
We would have to take matters
into our own hands.

33:06.470 --> 33:08.940
- By killing him?

33:08.940 --> 33:11.470
- As a last resort, yes, sir.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.910
We both thought it best
to talk to him in person,

33:13.910 --> 33:16.210
so we waited till we got here
in Chicago.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.180
- And what happened
when you got here?

33:18.180 --> 33:19.880
- We all went out partying.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.650
At the end of the night,
we all went our separate ways,

33:21.650 --> 33:23.920
but later on, Jake and I went
back to Trevor's house.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.490
- Did Trevor know
you were coming?

33:25.490 --> 33:28.890
- Negative. We both left
our cell phones behind,

33:28.890 --> 33:31.090
we jogged over to his place,
and we broke in.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.800
- And then what happened?
- We woke trev up,

33:33.800 --> 33:35.230
told him he needed
to kill the book,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.270
that it went
against the seal code

33:36.270 --> 33:38.930
and everything
that we stood for.

33:38.940 --> 33:42.140
He said that he wouldn't
back down now,

33:42.140 --> 33:44.110
that the book was
the right thing to do,

33:44.110 --> 33:47.980
and that he'd already given away
some of the money.

33:47.980 --> 33:51.080
And that's when Trevor grabbed
a kitchen knife, and...

33:53.750 --> 33:56.120
That's when things got
out of hand.

33:58.150 --> 34:01.260
Mr. and Mrs. Nichols,
I am so sorry.

34:01.260 --> 34:03.530
I loved Trevor
like he was my brother. I...

34:03.530 --> 34:07.100
- please tell the jury exactly
what occurred next.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.100
- Jake and I disarmed him.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.030
I held Trevor back

34:11.040 --> 34:14.800
as Jake picked up the knife
off the floor,

34:14.810 --> 34:17.070
and all of a sudden,
Jake spun around

34:17.070 --> 34:19.980
and landed a kill strike
to Trevor's thigh,

34:19.980 --> 34:22.750
to his femoral artery,
just like they trained us to do.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.250
Then we took the knife,

34:25.250 --> 34:27.050
Trevor's laptop, the book pages,

34:27.050 --> 34:29.150
a couple other things to make it
look like a robbery,

34:29.150 --> 34:34.060
and we... we just left Trevor
there on the floor,

34:34.060 --> 34:37.790
and we got the hell
out of there.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.300
- You made a plea bargain
with Mr. stone

34:46.300 --> 34:49.199
for a lighter sentence,
didn't you?

34:49.210 --> 34:52.310
- Did you inform him
that you had a personal motive

34:52.310 --> 34:54.580
to kill your friend Trevor?

34:54.580 --> 34:56.150
- What do you mean?

34:56.150 --> 34:59.880
- Well, he was marrying
your ex-girlfriend,

34:59.880 --> 35:01.580
Mia Jones, correct?
- Yes, but...

35:01.590 --> 35:04.090
- did you tell Mr. stone that
you're still in love with Mia

35:04.090 --> 35:06.260
before he offered you the deal
of the century?

35:06.260 --> 35:07.760
- Objection
to that characterization.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.260
- Rephrase, Mr. Olson.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.290
- You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

35:12.300 --> 35:15.160
Mia and trev,
they're perfect for one another.

35:15.170 --> 35:17.130
- Isn't it a fact
that you told my client

35:17.130 --> 35:19.300
that you hated Trevor
for stealing Mia?

35:19.300 --> 35:20.900
- No, sir, it's not.
- And that you would

35:20.910 --> 35:22.810
do everything in your power

35:22.810 --> 35:24.210
to stop their impending
marriage?

35:24.210 --> 35:25.610
- Jake's lying.

35:25.610 --> 35:27.240
How could you
talk all this crap, man?

35:27.240 --> 35:29.180
- Just answer the question,
Mr. soto.

35:29.180 --> 35:32.380
- In fact, you went there alone
and stabbed him to death

35:32.380 --> 35:36.350
because the thought of Trevor
and Mia together enraged you.

35:36.350 --> 35:38.820
- It wasn't about Mia.
It was about the Ukraine.

35:38.820 --> 35:43.330
- Ukraine? The simple fact is
that you got a sweetheart deal

35:43.330 --> 35:46.800
for killing your friend
in a jealous rage.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.330
Withdrawn.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.870
Nothing further.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.260
- Tell us what you meant
by the Ukraine, Mr. soto.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.090
- Objection to this distraction,
your honor.

36:17.090 --> 36:18.860
- Mr. Olson opened the door.
- Overruled.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.430
The witness may answer.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.370
- I can't.
I'm not supposed to.

36:25.370 --> 36:28.140
- We have heard
all about your seal code,

36:28.140 --> 36:31.670
but you swore an oath when you
took that witness stand.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.350
- Jake, Trevor, and I were
on operation omega

36:39.350 --> 36:41.980
in Ukraine two years ago.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.920
We were part of
a Navy seal team sent there

36:43.920 --> 36:46.390
to rescue a doctor who'd been
kidnapped by some rebels there.

36:46.390 --> 36:48.360
- And what happened
on the operation?

36:48.360 --> 36:51.190
- The mission went all wrong.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.300
Dr. Carter and two of our guys
were killed.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.930
- By the rebels?

36:55.930 --> 36:58.930
- The seals were, yes,

36:58.940 --> 37:03.240
but it was Trevor that shot
and killed Dr. Carter.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.970
Trevor mistook her
for an enemy fighter,

37:04.980 --> 37:07.410
ripped off half a dozen rounds
or so...

37:09.710 --> 37:13.180
And that's when the ambush went
down and all hell broke loose.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.220
The Navy covered it all up.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.290
They told some story
about how we were all heroes

37:17.290 --> 37:22.420
when the truth was
omega was a total train wreck.

37:22.430 --> 37:25.390
- You swore on direct
that Trevor was writing a book?

37:25.400 --> 37:28.300
- He was gonna tell how the Navy
lied to cover up the operation.

37:28.300 --> 37:31.300
- Is that why you and Jake
killed Trevor?

37:31.300 --> 37:34.140
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.310
- Can I please answer that,
your honor?

37:36.310 --> 37:38.140
- Overruled.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.310
- Jake and I both agreed
that it wasn't right

37:44.320 --> 37:46.280
that Trevor was gonna get rich
off the backs

37:46.280 --> 37:48.320
of our dead brothers
and piss all over the code.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.320
After everyone pumps you up
and thanks you for your service

37:51.320 --> 37:54.920
and tells you
what a big hero you are,

37:54.930 --> 37:57.190
you're supposed to keep quiet

37:57.190 --> 38:01.160
and try to forget
what really happened,

38:01.170 --> 38:03.270
but Trevor couldn't do that.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.400
He couldn't live with the shame.

38:08.410 --> 38:11.370
Maybe it wasn't about the money.

38:11.380 --> 38:15.780
Maybe he just wanted
to set the record straight

38:15.780 --> 38:18.410
so he could make peace
with what he did.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.230
- on the count
of first-degree murder,

38:33.230 --> 38:37.500
the jury finds
the defendant guilty.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.430
On the count of home invasion,

38:39.440 --> 38:42.470
the jury finds
the defendant guilty.

38:42.470 --> 38:46.110
On the count of conspiracy
to commit first-degree murder,

38:46.110 --> 38:49.340
the jury finds
the defendant guilty.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.570
- I hope you realize
I didn't have a choice.

39:16.570 --> 39:20.340
- The choice was,
"no redirect, your honor."

39:20.340 --> 39:22.140
- Our case was slipping away.

39:22.150 --> 39:24.310
- Whether that's true
is debatable.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.050
Either way,

39:26.050 --> 39:28.550
you made an end run
around my wishes.

39:28.550 --> 39:31.450
- If you want my letter of
resignation, I have one ready.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.290
- Tear it up.
I'm not vindictive.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.300
- Thank you.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.130
- Congratulations
on being right...

39:48.440 --> 39:50.570
But you're wrong.

39:57.180 --> 39:59.150
- Old town, gold coast,

39:59.150 --> 40:02.350
they plow so good
you don't even know it snowed.

40:02.350 --> 40:04.420
- My damn street looks
like a hockey rink.

40:04.420 --> 40:06.190
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

40:06.190 --> 40:10.390
the fridge played for the bears
and an actor was president.

40:10.390 --> 40:13.530
- Heh.
Back to the future, right?

40:19.470 --> 40:21.540
- What do you have
to take the chill off?

40:24.340 --> 40:27.440
- You didn't have to drop by
to check on me, Mr. jefferies.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.280
- Mark.

40:33.220 --> 40:35.580
Join me?

40:35.590 --> 40:37.550
- Why the hell not?

40:47.400 --> 40:49.360
To better days.

40:49.370 --> 40:50.700
- Better days.

40:58.510 --> 41:01.240
I had a visitor on Sunday.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.510
Buffed-up rear admiral
from Annapolis.

41:06.180 --> 41:07.520
- For your son?

41:10.350 --> 41:13.690
- He presented me with Trevor's
medals in a black leather box.

41:16.490 --> 41:19.460
Kid sent 'em back.

41:19.460 --> 41:22.130
You still have yours?

41:22.130 --> 41:25.230
- I threw them away years ago.
I hated the damn things.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.540
Couldn't look at them
without thinking

41:28.540 --> 41:32.340
about some of the things
I saw...

41:32.340 --> 41:34.010
And did.

41:41.520 --> 41:46.390
- 50 years, and I still can't
talk about it.

41:47.990 --> 41:51.560
- Maybe it's time, Grant.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.530
Maybe it's time.
