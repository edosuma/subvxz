00:00.010 --> 00:02.380
Previously on "Project Blue Book"...

00:02.400 --> 00:05.140
Our nation is suffering from
mass hysteria right now.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.039
We saw something in those
woods and it was real.

00:08.070 --> 00:11.250
You want me to investigate
flying saucers.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.620
Space ships, aliens,

00:12.640 --> 00:14.580
the Air Force knows they don't exist.

00:14.610 --> 00:16.450
The others that came believed me.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.060
- What others?
- The men in the hats.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.850
They left this for you.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.420
I think the doctor will perform
his role rather well, don't you?

00:26.440 --> 00:29.120
There's something off about him.

00:29.140 --> 00:32.159
I just didn't like him
asking so many questions.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.430
So I was thinking dinner
and a movie Friday.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.260
Would you like that?

01:13.280 --> 01:14.340
What movie?

01:15.660 --> 01:19.110
Well, "The Thing" is
playing at the Rialto.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.740
Tommy, you know I don't
like scary movies.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.170
Yeah, makes you hang all over me.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.520
That's kind of the point.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.659
Don't matter what movie,

01:29.660 --> 01:31.320
I'll still hang on to you.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.060
Whoa.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.290
Gina, hang on?

01:34.360 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, sure, Tommy.

01:46.970 --> 01:49.300
Unidentified aircraft
in Lubbock air space,

01:49.370 --> 01:50.840
please identify yourself.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.120
Tom? Tommy, you there?

02:12.300 --> 02:14.560
Oh, my God.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.940
Tommy, I see these strange lights.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.940
What's going on? Tommy?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.070
Gina, baby, hello?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.040
Hello?

02:24.870 --> 02:28.480
And they've been hiding the
truth from us for years.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.080
Since 1947,

02:30.110 --> 02:32.750
there've been over 1,200
confirmed sightings

02:32.780 --> 02:36.520
of strange objects in the
sky just in America.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.000
And we all know what
happened in Roswell.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.240
You call it a massive
government cover-up.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.230
Government and military.

02:46.740 --> 02:52.570
We're being visited by
aliens on a regular basis.

02:52.600 --> 02:57.480
The only question now is
whether or not those visits

02:57.560 --> 02:59.610
are preparation for invasion.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.280
The public has a right to
know for their own safety,

03:05.310 --> 03:09.380
and that is why I do the work I do.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.620
And important work it is.

03:11.650 --> 03:15.840
Folks, you can find the whole
story on newsstands now.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.250
It's a pleasure having you on, Donald.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.330
You really opened my eyes.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.500
Thank you for having the courage
to let me speak the truth.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.900
Let's hear it for our
guest, renowned author,

03:27.980 --> 03:30.970
flying saucer expert, Mr. Donald Keyhoe.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.210
Beautiful crowd. Beautiful crowd.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.380
Hmm.

03:43.420 --> 03:46.260
Mm-hmm.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.260
Mr. Keyhoe, sir?

03:49.290 --> 03:51.620
Mm-hmm. What do you want you me to sign?

03:52.540 --> 03:54.390
- Sir?
- Just tell me.

03:54.430 --> 03:59.060
Oh, here, to whom shall I make it out?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.220
- Uh...
- What's your name?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.320
Um...

04:07.140 --> 04:09.040
What is it that you want?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.220
Well, I understand that
you sometimes pay cash

04:12.240 --> 04:14.420
for the right kind of story.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.320
And this is...

04:17.390 --> 04:20.399
this is like nothing
you've ever seen before.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.360
I very much doubt that you can tell me

04:24.380 --> 04:25.580
anything I haven't seen before.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.400
No, this is bigger than Thomas Mantell

04:27.420 --> 04:30.230
and the government cover-up
of flying saucers.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.900
All right.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.500
Let's go.

04:46.750 --> 04:50.420
If I feel you have something worthy,

04:50.480 --> 04:53.040
then I'll pay.

04:54.590 --> 04:59.420
This is about the lights in
Texas... Lubbock, Texas.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.250
Joel?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.680
Is he all right?

05:57.350 --> 05:59.100
Hey.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.290
Joel, wake up.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.500
Hmm?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.860
What are you doing in the closet?

06:07.980 --> 06:09.430
Hiding.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.030
Hiding? From what?

06:12.100 --> 06:16.020
Space men... from Mars.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.520
_

06:23.280 --> 06:25.100
Where did you get this?

06:25.180 --> 06:26.480
At school.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.840
Everyone's reading it.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.880
Hello?

06:42.630 --> 06:45.680
The Communists in the
Kremlin are engaged in

06:45.700 --> 06:49.470
a monstrous conspiracy to stamp
out freedom all over the world.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.160
If they were to succeed,
the United States

06:53.180 --> 06:55.399
would be numbered among
their principle victims.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.380
It must be clear to everyone
that the United States...

06:58.440 --> 07:00.010
They call the bomb "Joe-3."

07:00.050 --> 07:01.680
Why?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.200
Russians air-drop their
first atom bomb test,

07:04.220 --> 07:05.820
somebody somewhere's
gonna give it a name.

07:05.950 --> 07:07.600
I'm guessing there was a number one

07:07.620 --> 07:08.960
and a number two before that.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.599
Just the idea of nuclear
war... pure insanity.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.840
You ask Harding, it's
only a matter of time

07:14.860 --> 07:17.130
before we find out whose
nukes are bigger.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.780
Are you doctors?

07:21.820 --> 07:23.650
No, we're here about the sighting.

07:23.690 --> 07:24.950
We're from Blue Book.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.810
I'm Gina. I'm Tom's fiancée.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.710
Gina, you're the one who called.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.340
How's he doing?

07:33.440 --> 07:36.180
They say he crashed his truck,

07:36.220 --> 07:39.250
but there's not a mark on him,

07:39.320 --> 07:41.460
and he just won't wake up.

07:44.020 --> 07:48.260
The thing is, if you saw his truck,

07:48.330 --> 07:50.940
it just don't make no sense.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.060
Listen, if... if now is a
bad time, we can come back.

07:53.090 --> 07:55.670
You know the power went out
right when it happened?

07:55.700 --> 07:57.700
All over town.

07:57.740 --> 08:01.330
Like this craft or whatever it was

08:01.360 --> 08:03.340
sucked it right out of the sky.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.640
Craft?

08:04.680 --> 08:06.439
Did you see something, too?

08:06.440 --> 08:07.900
A lot of folks did.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.580
Ask around.

08:09.650 --> 08:13.040
V-shaped lights flying
faster than a meteor.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.499
I'm sure they keep radar
logs at the tower.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.300
You know, I'd like to get
a look at his truck.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.760
Tom?

08:21.830 --> 08:23.740
Doctor? Hello?

08:23.760 --> 08:24.780
Tom?

08:25.270 --> 08:27.640
Ah! Tom?

08:30.540 --> 08:31.940
Baby?

08:32.010 --> 08:33.740
What just happened?

08:58.580 --> 09:01.940
Oh, I got it, Donna.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.440
Oh, are you stocking up
for the bomb shelter?

09:04.470 --> 09:08.070
Jack wants to be fully prepared
for the end of the world.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.660
Sounds like one of Joel's nightmares.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.180
Well, with those reds in
Korea, Chairman Mao in China,

09:14.240 --> 09:16.280
nightmare sounds about right.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.660
Was it difficult to build?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.700
Oh, no. We just picked it
up at the hardware store.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.310
It comes mostly assembled.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.910
Those underground ones are so expensive.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.620
And it makes you feel safer?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.700
Snug like bugs in a rug.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.220
Seems cozy.

09:35.490 --> 09:39.820
But the thing is, there's only
room for one family inside.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.360
Oh, of course, I-I wasn't...
I wasn't suggesting...

09:42.390 --> 09:43.890
Oh, I know you weren't.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.290
But Jack and I, we discussed it.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.960
I mean, you have to.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.700
What would you do if
someone came knocking?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.900
Well, what would you do?

09:53.940 --> 09:57.820
Jack bought a rifle and told
me not to worry about it.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.140
Allen in town?

10:03.180 --> 10:06.320
- He's away on business.
- Great.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.850
Well, when he gets back, we
need to have dinner real soon.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.760
He still had his hands on the
wheel when we got to him.

10:17.830 --> 10:20.180
Had to pry 'em off.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.530
Eyes wide open.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.880
Couldn't say a word.

10:26.340 --> 10:29.580
Just craziest thing I ever saw.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.180
Jesus.

10:37.210 --> 10:38.760
You pulled him out of this thing?

10:40.220 --> 10:42.320
You'd think maybe another
vehicle was involved,

10:42.360 --> 10:46.680
but there's no skid marks,
no sign of a collision.

10:46.890 --> 10:51.490
It's just the strangest
thing I ever saw.

10:51.530 --> 10:54.330
Can't explain it at all.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.780
They say he crashed his truck,

11:01.860 --> 11:04.200
but there's not a mark on him.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.510
What are you thinking?

11:11.550 --> 11:15.380
Thermal strain can cause tensile
stress in some metals like this,

11:15.420 --> 11:18.520
but, uh, if that was electrical,

11:18.540 --> 11:20.420
it would have to be tuned
to the right frequency.

11:20.490 --> 11:23.040
This blackout people been reporting,

11:23.060 --> 11:25.020
what do we know about that?

11:25.060 --> 11:26.760
Well, power grid out
here isn't the best.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.730
It could've just been the old lights,

11:28.760 --> 11:32.660
but, uh, blackouts don't usually
send folks into a blind panic.

11:32.700 --> 11:36.300
Tied up our phone lines
pretty good last night.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.860
- Last night?
- Yeah, we've been traveling.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.810
We don't know anything about this.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.870
Mostly near the University.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.020
A regular riot on campus.

11:47.570 --> 11:51.200
_

11:57.590 --> 12:00.040
Hi. How are you?

12:01.540 --> 12:04.400
Well, the Dean was, uh, kind
enough to give us a room

12:04.420 --> 12:06.360
to interview the witnesses,
and according to this,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.970
it should be just over...

12:13.380 --> 12:15.210
This way. Come on, we're late.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.470
Just gonna double-check.

12:18.810 --> 12:20.910
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.160
Look, we seem to have lost our heading.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.939
We're looking for the Science
Administration building.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.550
I don't know if you can
point me in that direction.

12:26.590 --> 12:28.720
It's right there.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.020
What do you know?

12:30.060 --> 12:31.420
By the way, I'm Leigh-Ann.

12:31.490 --> 12:32.860
Any plans tonight?

12:32.890 --> 12:34.760
Uh, homecoming party.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.490
You should come.

12:36.530 --> 12:37.830
I'll think about it.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.660
- Okay.
- Nice meeting you.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.440
You were right. This way.

12:42.540 --> 12:45.500
Those are not women you're, uh,
chatting up there, Captain.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.540
They're school girls.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.310
Grad students.

12:48.340 --> 12:49.920
When I was their age, I was old enough

12:49.940 --> 12:52.860
to escort bombers over Berlin, so...

12:54.580 --> 12:56.480
Guess I missed all this.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.580
Big homecoming party tonight.

12:59.650 --> 13:01.520
Just got invited, by the way.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.740
These are all witnesses?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.400
No, that's a negative.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.700
Some of these are just kids
trying to get out of class.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.760
Hello. I'm Captain Quinn.

13:24.820 --> 13:27.800
This is Dr. Hynek from the
United States Air Force.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.880
Now listen, we don't have
a lot of time today,

13:29.900 --> 13:32.620
so if you don't need
to be here, beat it.

13:35.350 --> 13:38.560
Come on. Let's go.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.690
Hello, everyone.

13:40.700 --> 13:41.720
Thank you for coming.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.680
Uh, we do understand it can be hard

13:44.700 --> 13:46.380
to come forward as a witness, so, uh,

13:46.400 --> 13:47.830
we do appreciate you being here.

13:48.780 --> 13:52.330
Now, um, if you believe
that you have seen

13:52.340 --> 13:55.590
these strange lights in the sky,

13:55.610 --> 13:57.310
please raise your hands.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.000
This many witnesses?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.140
That's a new one.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.790
I'd just come out of the cafeteria

14:12.820 --> 14:15.490
when it passed overheard.

14:15.530 --> 14:17.180
All the lights went out.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.740
It was terrifying.

14:19.750 --> 14:23.130
I thought they were stars at first.

14:23.170 --> 14:26.560
And then they started moving.

14:26.620 --> 14:29.840
And all of a sudden I look up,

14:29.940 --> 14:32.960
and I... and I saw this
thing hovering over me.

14:32.980 --> 14:36.600
I felt all tight inside

14:36.620 --> 14:38.680
like there was something
grabbing hold of me.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.720
My heart was just pounding so fast

14:40.780 --> 14:43.280
that I thought it was gonna burst.

14:43.300 --> 14:47.140
And I thought, "Planes don't do that."

14:47.180 --> 14:49.980
Figured they were stars.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.600
They were awful bright.

14:51.680 --> 14:56.020
But the scariest thing...
it didn't make a sound.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.620
So I ran.

14:57.650 --> 15:00.480
I thought I was gonna die.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.750
I prayed.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.260
It was the last thing I could do.

15:03.290 --> 15:04.590
I didn't know how to react.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.580
I was just terrified, and I fainted.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.500
Never seen anything like
that before in my life.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.420
Question, Professor.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.020
What exactly am I looking at here?

15:19.040 --> 15:20.350
Well, I've taken the accounts

15:20.380 --> 15:23.420
and created a grid of the
night sky over the campus...

15:23.500 --> 15:26.180
timeframes, angles of
sight, light interference.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.980
It is a composite
sketch of the sighting.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.520
So what's it telling you?

15:36.240 --> 15:38.390
Shooting stars... not possible.

15:38.430 --> 15:42.890
Plane... well, there were no
scheduled flights that evening.

15:42.930 --> 15:46.680
But the power outage, now,
I'm starting to think...

15:48.270 --> 15:50.360
Good, you're still here.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.420
And you must be Hynek.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.800
Dr. Allen Hynek.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.380
Ah. I'm Professor Carlton Fanshaw.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.110
This is my classroom.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.080
I, uh, need it for the next period.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.740
Of course, but the Dean assured
us that we had use of...

16:03.750 --> 16:06.900
This classroom is not the domain
of the Dean's, it's mine.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.420
You must be misinformed.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.720
We're here on official
government business.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.220
No, no, no, no, I'm well informed.

16:12.260 --> 16:15.380
I know exactly who you are. I
know exactly why you're here.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.200
And trust me when I say you
won't be needing my chalkboard

16:18.220 --> 16:20.830
because I have this.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.080
Hold on.

16:25.140 --> 16:26.870
Is that...

16:26.910 --> 16:29.070
What you've been
looking for. Yes, it is.

16:29.110 --> 16:32.960
And, uh, not only did I take
that photograph last night,

16:33.040 --> 16:34.620
but I've done your job for you.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.750
Gentlemen, I've solved the
mystery of the Lubbock lights.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.620
Your work here is done.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.359
Having seen the photograph,
the answer is quite obvious

16:50.360 --> 16:55.460
to anyone familiar with
the local avian fauna.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.170
Plovers?

16:58.230 --> 17:00.630
Your basic plover is a, uh...

17:00.670 --> 17:02.240
it's a water bird.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.840
It's about the size of a quail.

17:03.860 --> 17:05.579
I know what a plover is.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.640
Please go on, Professor.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.880
Well, you see, the oily
white breast of the plover

17:11.900 --> 17:15.480
serves as a, uh... a highly
efficient reflective surface.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.750
So when a light shines on it from below

17:17.790 --> 17:21.380
from the recently installed
mercury-vapor street lamps

17:21.400 --> 17:25.859
along Hollister Avenue
hitting a flock in flight,

17:25.890 --> 17:31.500
you get, voilà, a V-shaped alien armada.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.580
_

17:49.820 --> 17:52.620
It's got 43 pieces,
full set of wrenches.

17:52.690 --> 17:54.790
You can do anything you want
in your house with this.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.290
I'll tell you what,
we've got it on sale.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.850
You're not gonna find it anywhere else

17:58.860 --> 18:00.890
for any better price than that.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.560
Maybe you could take a little more off?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.970
It's $0.40. It's on sale.

18:05.030 --> 18:06.470
What are you gonna do?

18:06.540 --> 18:08.840
You want it? Let's ring you up for it.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.300
Excuse me.

18:10.370 --> 18:12.410
Hi. I'm just with a
customer right now, ma'am.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.710
Sorry, I-I'll just...

18:16.110 --> 18:17.780
So, uh, you rooting for Texas?

19:04.430 --> 19:06.060
There you are.

19:06.090 --> 19:07.290
Can I help you, ma'am?

19:07.360 --> 19:10.230
- Uh...
- Do you have a question?

19:10.260 --> 19:12.530
Yes, sorry, the, um...

19:12.570 --> 19:15.530
The sign outside...

19:15.570 --> 19:17.279
do you have any shelters in stock?

19:17.280 --> 19:18.360
We do.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.180
So why don't you get your
hubby to drop by tomorrow

19:20.200 --> 19:22.610
so he and I can talk? It'll
take some explaining.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.640
Unfortunately, the hubby's out of town

19:25.660 --> 19:28.250
and the wifey would like to
surprise him when he gets back,

19:28.280 --> 19:31.160
so why don't you ring one up
and deliver it by morning

19:31.180 --> 19:34.190
so I can build my own bomb
shelter before he gets home?

19:35.040 --> 19:37.740
Did I explain that
clearly enough for you?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.260
Yes, ma'am.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.960
A man can only sit over his putt so long

19:49.980 --> 19:51.420
before he gets the shakes.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.860
Yeah, just one more reason

19:52.880 --> 19:54.760
I never much cared for that game.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.560
Try playing on a regular basis.
You'd hate it even more.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.150
Should I go watch paint
dry while you figure out

20:00.180 --> 20:01.580
what you'd like to do here, Nathan?

20:05.320 --> 20:07.390
You know, I forgot to
ask, how is Mrs. Harding?

20:07.450 --> 20:09.390
Is she okay?

20:09.460 --> 20:11.520
- She's fine.
- Well, you know, I just figured

20:11.560 --> 20:13.560
she has to put up with
you every single day,

20:13.630 --> 20:15.290
that woman needs looking after.

20:15.330 --> 20:16.760
Uh-huh.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.080
Bogey, six o'clock.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.330
General?

20:21.370 --> 20:23.320
Oh, shit.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.640
At ease.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.940
General Valentine said you'd
want to see this right away.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.680
Donald Keyhoe.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.250
Who's the other man?

20:38.290 --> 20:40.380
A civilian. Rudy Pitts.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.540
His uncle is the county sheriff
of Lubbock, Texas, sir.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.239
Lubbock?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.620
Yes, sir.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.440
Yeah, I know, you got to go.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.610
We'll finish this next time.

20:51.620 --> 20:52.720
No, no, we won't.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.520
Checkmate.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.880
Son of a bitch.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.690
Mm. Next time we go golfing.

21:02.730 --> 21:03.880
Oh, I'm shaking.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.400
Snow in Texas.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.830
What do you know? What
are we doing here?

21:09.870 --> 21:13.240
This is where Fanshaw
allegedly took his photograph.

21:13.320 --> 21:17.040
Gina says the, uh, lights were
moving faster than a meteor.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.640
Does the good professor
honestly expect us to believe

21:19.680 --> 21:23.440
that your basic plover
could fly that fast?

21:23.460 --> 21:26.350
You know, it doesn't bother me
if someone else gets credit.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.480
Our job is to close
the case. That's all.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.820
Our job is to find the truth.

21:30.850 --> 21:34.060
Sometimes I think you're
trying to convince yourself

21:34.100 --> 21:35.560
more than anybody else.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.460
Like you know something I don't.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.870
Hey. I know you.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.180
Leigh-Ann.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.640
What are you doing here?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.920
- I just picked up my friend Tammy.
- Hi.

21:51.940 --> 21:52.979
Hi.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.680
We're going to the homecoming party.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.280
Want to come? There's
room for one more inside.

21:57.310 --> 22:00.280
I'm sorry, ma'am, no can do.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.620
Working late tonight.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.850
Top-secret mission, Captain?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.320
Military protocol forbids me from

22:08.360 --> 22:10.520
giving a direct answer to that question.

22:13.030 --> 22:15.240
You're cute. Maybe next time.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.700
Are plovers even nocturnal?

22:51.770 --> 22:54.700
Wouldn't they be sleeping right now?

23:00.660 --> 23:02.840
Hey.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.560
What the hell you doing out here?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.220
Good evening.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.850
I said, what are you doing?

23:07.880 --> 23:09.519
Just taking pictures, Mister.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.200
Nothing to worry about.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.620
Hey, I were you, I'd put that
bat back where it belongs.

23:14.650 --> 23:15.820
Who are you?

23:15.860 --> 23:17.540
Uh, Dr. Allen Hynek.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.860
This is Captain Quinn.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.600
We work for the United States Air Force.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.990
You got any I.D.?

23:22.030 --> 23:24.600
I don't carry identification.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.280
Big surprise.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.120
He's another one, I bet.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.060
Another one? What do you mean?

23:30.140 --> 23:32.840
We had other men out here just
last week doing like you are.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.540
Right before the spaceships came.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.510
Other men?

23:36.540 --> 23:38.010
Who were they?

23:38.040 --> 23:40.340
They scrammed before we could ask.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.680
Commies probably.

23:41.710 --> 23:43.350
Oh, here we go.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.940
You look like a Commie to me.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.880
I warned you about the bat.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.500
Mary, call the police.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.840
Yeah, I'm gonna need your camera.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.490
We are duly enfranchised representatives

23:57.530 --> 23:59.200
of the United States government.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.960
Everyone, go back to your homes.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.870
There's nothing to see here.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.040
They're coming back.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.280
The flying saucers are coming back.

24:12.310 --> 24:14.340
They're coming back!

24:25.000 --> 24:26.470
So now what?

24:26.510 --> 24:28.640
Wait for flying saucers to show up?

24:32.110 --> 24:35.450
Based on our witness
reports, this is the place.

25:25.160 --> 25:28.000
I surrender.

25:28.030 --> 25:30.500
I'm sorry, I've just been so on edge.

25:31.740 --> 25:35.810
I bought a bomb shelter today.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.380
Hardware store's delivering
it in the morning.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.420
Build it yourself.

25:42.150 --> 25:44.360
What on earth made you do that?

25:45.960 --> 25:48.120
Allen's gone more and more

25:48.150 --> 25:51.060
and Joel's been having trouble sleeping,

25:51.090 --> 25:54.660
and with all this talk about
Russians and the atomic bomb...

25:57.460 --> 25:59.830
I don't think there's
anything wrong with

25:59.870 --> 26:03.400
doing what you can to feel safe.

26:03.430 --> 26:06.000
Thank you for my flowers.

26:08.020 --> 26:10.720
I owe you an apology.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.280
For what?

26:12.340 --> 26:14.139
The beatnik club.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.120
I shouldn't have taken you there.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.610
No, it was my idea.

26:17.620 --> 26:19.820
It wasn't your fault at all.

26:19.850 --> 26:22.050
I should be apologizing.

26:22.660 --> 26:25.690
I ran out on you.

26:26.680 --> 26:31.119
You sure it wasn't something I did?

26:32.560 --> 26:35.100
Allen's a professor at
the local university,

26:35.120 --> 26:38.370
and I was worried that if someone saw me

26:38.400 --> 26:40.240
in a place like that...

26:45.440 --> 26:49.010
I don't have friends here.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.910
I was afraid that I lost you.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.580
You didn't lose me.

27:01.890 --> 27:05.390
Wow. Don't see stars
like that in the city.

27:05.430 --> 27:08.360
How many would you guess that there are?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.530
Just in the Milky Way?

27:10.680 --> 27:12.700
I don't know. A million, two?

27:12.780 --> 27:15.570
100 billion.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.410
And every one of them
has a story to tell us.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.380
You like stories.

27:23.410 --> 27:27.440
I've dedicated my life to them.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.580
Well, how's this one?

27:30.650 --> 27:33.420
Professor dipstick tells us it's birds

27:33.490 --> 27:35.200
and you think that's crap,

27:35.220 --> 27:37.090
so we drive out to Hollister Street

27:37.160 --> 27:39.780
where the neighbors greet us
with pitchforks and torches

27:39.820 --> 27:41.660
till someone shouts, "Spaceship,"

27:41.780 --> 27:43.820
then we drive out to
the middle of nowhere,

27:43.860 --> 27:45.400
we look up at the stars,

27:45.430 --> 27:47.670
100 billion of them, it turns out,

27:47.700 --> 27:51.660
until we realize spaceships
never showed up.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.010
The end.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.180
That's not a story.

27:55.210 --> 27:57.880
That's a-a wild goose chase.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.680
Yes, it is.

28:04.690 --> 28:06.320
I'll bet I know what you're thinking.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.360
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:08.390 --> 28:11.720
You wish you were at that
homecoming party with, uh...

28:11.800 --> 28:14.820
- Leigh-Ann.
- Yeah.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.900
You blame me?

28:16.980 --> 28:20.070
I do remember what it feels like.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.920
Pretty girl, a party.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.180
So are we done here?

28:31.220 --> 28:33.400
I'll drop you at the dorm.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.880
Roger that.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.300
Just, uh, give me a minute.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.780
All right.

29:02.410 --> 29:05.080
♪ I race automobiles ♪

29:05.180 --> 29:07.350
♪ And I'm a farmer ♪

29:27.020 --> 29:29.120
Get away from the car!

29:29.180 --> 29:30.340
What's wrong?

30:01.360 --> 30:03.580
What the hell was that?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.440
So the power did go out again?

30:09.510 --> 30:12.710
Five years working here,
this never happened once.

30:12.740 --> 30:15.140
Now it's twice in one week.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.680
Anything on the screen?

30:16.710 --> 30:19.780
Same thing as the whole
town saw, V-shaped lights.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.620
I logged its path.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.820
Gas station,

30:28.860 --> 30:33.320
Baroody Farm,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.730
the Lumber Yard,

30:36.770 --> 30:38.880
and the airport.

30:40.820 --> 30:43.840
Okay, based on our records,

30:43.870 --> 30:47.580
blue lights were...

30:47.610 --> 30:51.160
here...

30:52.680 --> 30:56.900
here, and...

30:58.920 --> 31:01.490
here.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.299
Give us a moment, will you?

31:19.180 --> 31:22.000
Rolling blackout matches the
flight path on the radar.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.250
What happened in the car last night?

31:26.280 --> 31:27.680
I don't even know where to start.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.300
The V-shaped formation of blue lights,

31:31.420 --> 31:33.040
I saw them with my own eyes.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.290
We both did.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.930
West Virginia, recon.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.110
Pilot in North Dakota,
aerial engagement.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.600
Last night, ground assault.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.380
Maybe Joe-3 isn't the only thing
the Russians are testing.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.610
Or maybe it's not the Russians.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.550
Going down to 215 West 57th.

32:00.580 --> 32:03.350
Mr. Keyhoe? Come with us, please.

32:03.390 --> 32:04.979
Hey, get your hands off me.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.180
Just relax.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.500
I don't know who you think you are

32:17.530 --> 32:19.270
or what you're doing,

32:19.330 --> 32:20.920
but I'm a member in good standing

32:20.940 --> 32:22.619
of the fourth estate
answering to no one...

32:22.620 --> 32:25.760
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

32:25.820 --> 32:29.000
Now, you listen.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.110
The next article you
write for True Magazine

32:31.120 --> 32:35.080
or anybody else, we're
gonna read it first.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.220
As a matter of fact, from now on,

32:38.300 --> 32:41.750
you're gonna write the stories
we want you to write.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.700
That's who I am.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.870
You're so good at this.

32:53.900 --> 32:56.240
Where'd you learn carpentry?

32:56.270 --> 32:58.900
My father always wanted a son.

32:58.940 --> 33:00.640
I never volunteered,

33:00.660 --> 33:02.840
but he made sure I knew
how to swing a hammer.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.580
That's him.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.720
The man from the hardware store.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.570
Do you see him?

33:36.340 --> 33:39.720
Come on. He's gone now, whoever he was.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.400
Well, the Giants beat
everybody but Cleveland.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.330
I mean, you got Otto Graham
as your quarterback,

33:54.360 --> 33:55.900
it's kind of a one-sided thing.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.400
The guy's a... he's... Uh, hold on.

33:58.430 --> 33:59.760
What?

34:00.640 --> 34:02.700
Aw, shit.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.740
Mr. Secretary.

34:04.970 --> 34:06.640
What did you do?

34:06.710 --> 34:08.469
Well, that's a pretty
long list there, William.

34:08.540 --> 34:09.760
You want to be a little more specific?

34:09.780 --> 34:12.440
Keyhoe. The writer.

34:12.480 --> 34:16.340
You authorized men to intimidate
and terrify a journalist?

34:16.420 --> 34:18.150
He's a former Marine.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.199
Keyhoe's a hack. We're
not even sure he's a...

34:20.199 --> 34:21.489
He's an American citizen!

34:21.550 --> 34:23.219
In my eyes that's more than enough.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.380
I'm warning you, both of you,

34:27.460 --> 34:31.020
I will not tolerate lawless enterprise.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.730
You fix it, now.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.560
Do you understand me?

34:35.159 --> 34:38.040
Loud and clear.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.440
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing here.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.100
What am I doing here, Bill?

34:46.639 --> 34:50.659
Try it again and I will
march into the Oval Office

34:50.659 --> 34:53.679
and I will tell the President
all of your secrets.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.400
What do you think Truman
will do when he hears them?

35:11.370 --> 35:13.450
You could have tried it my way first.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.040
Oh, come on, do I look worried?

35:16.070 --> 35:17.740
I'll change that.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.360
I just heard from Captain Quinn.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.540
He and Hynek swear they
have conclusive evidence

35:23.550 --> 35:25.640
about an unidentified flying object.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.740
Gentlemen, what we're about to show you,

35:34.750 --> 35:36.180
you never saw.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.150
Do you understand?

35:38.180 --> 35:39.780
This is so far above your need-to-know,

35:39.820 --> 35:41.380
it might as well be on the moon.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.020
What you found in Texas...

35:46.060 --> 35:49.630
the lights, the radar
reports all of it...

35:49.660 --> 35:52.630
was not an unidentified flying object.

35:52.660 --> 35:56.230
It was one of ours out of
Randolph Air Force Base.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.000
It's a top-secret military craft

35:59.040 --> 36:02.010
unofficially known as the V-Wing.

36:02.040 --> 36:05.700
It's experimental and highly classified.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.910
That's your UFO.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.940
We need you to keep it
out of the public eye.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.180
A cover story.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.690
Birds, for example... that's
a plausible explanation.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.820
Now just wait one minute.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.960
Uh, what about the power outages?

36:22.990 --> 36:26.030
What kind of experimental craft
could possibly cause that?

36:29.170 --> 36:30.970
Captain, you want to tell them about

36:31.000 --> 36:33.140
what happened with the car?

36:34.700 --> 36:38.970
Professor, did you just call me a liar?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.440
No, of course, not.

36:40.470 --> 36:43.440
Boys, we're all on the same team here.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.960
And we all have the same
job to do for America.

36:50.490 --> 36:52.720
Keep it out of the public eye.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.220
Roger that.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.820
Thank you, Captain.

36:59.700 --> 37:02.530
We'll send an escort to get you back.

37:15.710 --> 37:18.380
Top-secret military craft?

37:18.400 --> 37:19.980
That is the cover story.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.020
You, of all people, should
know that there is no way that

37:22.030 --> 37:24.080
that is a plausible explanation
for what we witnessed.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.080
You know, you got to be the dumbest
smart person I've ever met.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.080
Hello?

37:54.690 --> 37:57.220
- Dad!
- Hey. How you doing?

37:57.250 --> 37:59.090
Mom put new locks on the doors.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.920
Yes, I noticed.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.630
Why don't you go and wash up?

38:08.670 --> 38:10.330
Sure.

38:18.070 --> 38:20.860
Dead bolts on the doors?

38:21.750 --> 38:23.700
What's going on here, Mimi?

38:25.250 --> 38:27.080
Someone's been following me.

38:27.150 --> 38:28.850
What?

38:28.890 --> 38:30.520
There was a man at the hardware store

38:30.540 --> 38:33.690
and then I saw him again at the
end of the driveway, watching.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.190
What did he look like?

38:35.220 --> 38:37.020
I don't know. I didn't get
a really good look at him.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.030
Fedora hat? Trench coat?

38:40.060 --> 38:42.530
Allen, what are you talking about?

38:42.570 --> 38:43.700
You're scaring me.

38:44.030 --> 38:48.860
I'm sorry. I'm just, uh, upset.

38:51.710 --> 38:53.110
I don't think you need to worry.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.740
But I do worry.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.580
You're gone for most of the time
and it's just me and Joel now,

38:57.600 --> 38:59.710
and I don't think there's
anything wrong with

38:59.750 --> 39:03.680
making sure...

39:03.720 --> 39:05.100
Joel.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.160
Want to show Dad our big surprise?

39:08.220 --> 39:09.520
Okay.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.960
Come on.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.630
He's been waiting all day.

39:29.860 --> 39:32.840
It's like having a fort in the backyard.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.720
You built this all by yourself?

39:39.680 --> 39:41.860
My friend Susie helped me.

39:41.890 --> 39:43.490
Ah.

39:43.530 --> 39:48.020
We made soup. Do you want some, Dad?

39:48.860 --> 39:54.180
The way the world is, every
day it's something bad.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.970
I can't just wait for
things to get better,

40:00.520 --> 40:05.180
- so I built a bomb shelter.
- Thanks.

40:07.020 --> 40:10.650
I wonder if we need special
anti-radiation suits.

40:10.690 --> 40:12.340
That'd be neat.

40:12.440 --> 40:16.060
Well, I'll tell you what, I
will look into it first thing.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.400
Now here is Edward R. Murrow.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.570
This is the news.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.960
The President says if we are forced into

40:29.970 --> 40:31.840
full-scale fighting in Korea,

40:31.870 --> 40:34.910
the enemy will find out that
we are stronger than ever.

40:34.980 --> 40:38.400
He told reporters today that
he is backing General Ridgeway

40:38.420 --> 40:40.980
100% in the armistice talks.

40:41.020 --> 40:43.280
There was no word from the enemy today

40:43.300 --> 40:44.720
on General Ridgeway's proposal

40:44.740 --> 40:46.590
to get the conferences going again.

40:46.650 --> 40:49.890
A United Nations broadcast
says the resumption of the...

41:32.400 --> 41:38.340
_

41:38.800 --> 41:42.180
You want to tell me what's on your mind?

41:42.240 --> 41:43.760
Hynek.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.740
The professor?

41:46.160 --> 41:48.010
What about him?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.880
I'm wondering if Professor
Hynek will one day

41:52.900 --> 41:56.580
be a problem that needs solving.

42:04.360 --> 42:10.760
_

42:25.580 --> 42:30.520
