00:33.333 --> 00:34.333
Stop her!

01:09.069 --> 01:11.604
Lynn!

01:11.605 --> 01:15.207
If you're difficult,
you might get hurt.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.676
Let's not be difficult.

01:38.798 --> 01:42.601
You have to lower
the forcefield.

01:42.602 --> 01:48.975
We can't get out to save Lynn.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.381
Community.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.683
We exist together.

01:57.684 --> 02:02.222
But with Lynn missing,
our community is broken.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.535
Justice.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.472
We insist the Skin Riders
return her.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.844
Answer.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.780
Answer!

02:30.950 --> 02:36.121
If you knew what it feels
like to lose someone...

02:36.122 --> 02:39.859
you'd help us.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.960
Tasha, can you hear me?

02:41.961 --> 02:43.062
Tasha?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.930
She's still not respondin.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.098
Pulse is in the 80s.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.633
Just a second.

02:47.634 --> 02:48.435
Anything at all?

02:48.436 --> 02:49.935
Tasha, can you hear me?

02:49.936 --> 02:51.437
Tasha?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.706
Tasha, can you hear me?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.376
Tasha, I need you to
respond for me, okay?

03:02.215 --> 03:03.215
Tasha-

03:03.216 --> 03:04.217
Okay-

03:13.360 --> 03:15.362
Any luck?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.965
I only know a few symbols.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.635
I'm not even sure if my message
is making any sense.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.671
Ezra knows you're trying.

03:25.672 --> 03:26.740
Said you found a notebook.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.381
It looks like chicken scratch.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.149
Shorthand.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.484
I made it up

03:38.485 --> 03:41.987
so I could take faster nots
during sessions with patient.

03:41.988 --> 03:46.625
No one in the world could have
written that but me, Feena.

03:46.626 --> 03:47.861
I was one of the settlers.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.132
What do you think that mean?

03:53.133 --> 03:55.768
That we were all here befor?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.870
Why didn't the Obelisk tell us?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.972
'Cause it wants to control us,

03:59.973 --> 04:00.973
use us.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.508
What else is it not telling us?

04:02.509 --> 04:03.589
That's what I want to know.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.345
Well, what do you think
we should do?

04:06.346 --> 04:07.346
Burn it down.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.281
Break it apart.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.850
I can't let you do that, Ezra.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.452
It's keeping me from my wife.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.788
It allowed your wife to be
reborn in the first place.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.822
I'd rather she stay dead
than become one of them.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.491
I hope you remember that.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.160
If she does become a Skin Rider,

04:21.161 --> 04:26.399
the only mercy you can show her
is to take her life.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.020
You're awa.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.623
I wish we didn't
have to do that.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.661
The exits are guarded, so...

05:37.804 --> 05:41.840
We're not unlike you, real.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.543
We care for our own,

05:44.544 --> 05:45.864
respect the divine,
and work hard.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.616
What happened to you, Silas?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.684
Everyone keeps asking me that.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.391
The world has changed, Lynn.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.227
I've changed.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.997
I can help you change too.

06:06.566 --> 06:07.566
Where's Ezra?

06:08.468 --> 06:12.638
Ezra.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.807
He'll take a little
more convincing.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.877
Whatever you're doing here,
if it harms him,

06:18.878 --> 06:20.213
I won't let you.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.883
I've always admired
your strength, Lynn,

06:24.884 --> 06:27.719
even when it's misplace.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.155
Now's a good time to cooperate.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.657
And if I don't?

06:36.596 --> 06:41.099
The Sparks worked hard
to rebuild you, Lynn.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.970
It'd be a shame to have all
that hard work go to waste.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.367
The forcefield's still up,

07:48.368 --> 07:50.135
so I won't ask how it's going.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.705
Here, you haven't eaten all day.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.908
You made this?

07:56.909 --> 07:58.577
What?

07:58.578 --> 08:03.750
You don't think I can cook?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.318
Water and weeds.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.021
I was going to make you
a burger and fries,

08:09.022 --> 08:12.924
but then I thought, no, Abram
would want water and weeds.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.493
I can't cook, actually.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.727
Duncan used to do all that.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.630
Pastas, quiches, desserts.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.033
Never even followed a recipe.

08:20.933 --> 08:27.005
That's a man you hold onto.

08:27.006 --> 08:33.010
Yeah...

08:33.011 --> 08:34.880
Do you think the Sparks
would remake him?

08:34.881 --> 08:37.150
Now, I mean,
that he's a Skin Rider.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.354
You're asking if there can be
two of the same person at once?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.188
The simple answer is no.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.590
Duncan is alive.

08:45.591 --> 08:49.561
The Sparks do not create
what already exists.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.962
What if he were to die?

08:50.963 --> 08:52.230
Would the Sparks remake him?

08:52.231 --> 08:53.999
The Sparks rebirth an individual

08:54.000 --> 08:56.568
because he is of benefit
to the community,

08:56.569 --> 08:58.804
not because you ask
him to be reborn.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.672
Of course it would
benefit the community.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.874
Everything Duncan does
is for other people.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.643
He's completely unselfish.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.379
The human Duncan, yes.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.447
It's not his fault
that he's a Skin Rider.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.184
You are quick to defend him,
and yet he attacked you.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.351
That wasn't him.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.052
The real Duncan
wouldn't do that.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.321
I do not choose
who is reborn, Feena.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.824
You need not convince me.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.626
Then my only option is to
cure Duncan of the parasite.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.162
The parasite is stronger
than you know.

09:24.163 --> 09:27.099
Its dominion over its host
is absolute.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.102
It will never release him.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.908
YYYou have been reconstituted.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.613
I am programmed not to answer.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.291
Duncan...

09:53.192 --> 09:54.026
What happened to you?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.228
You're a hologram, Feena.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.330
A brain state.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.532
The drone could give you
this information,

10:00.533 --> 10:01.934
but I blocked its access to you.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.438
I don't understand.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.439
Where are we?

10:11.043 --> 10:14.513
He loves you so completely.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.514
Blindly.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.418
The mere thought of you
causes him to ache with longin.

10:19.819 --> 10:23.289
I see it all here, in his mind.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.827
Who are you?

10:28.928 --> 10:31.130
I am Duncan now.

10:31.564 --> 10:37.068
And his greatest weakness,
his greatest distraction,

10:37.069 --> 10:38.069
is you.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.010
He is...

10:45.011 --> 10:48.613
Screaming at me.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.081
Begging me,

10:50.082 --> 10:52.050
because he knows
that when I find you...

10:52.051 --> 10:55.720
And I will find you.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.190
That I will kill you.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.561
And I wanted him to know that.

11:11.904 --> 11:15.073
Ezr.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.942
We're thinking about this
the wrong way.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.977
The Obelisk sent you
to find this weapon.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.146
Yellow says it's designed to
destroy something called.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.548
"The Ancestor."

11:23.549 --> 11:25.183
The record of the Skin Riders?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.384
More than a record...

11:26.385 --> 11:28.153
A central nervous
system of sorts.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.387
We knock that out,

11:29.388 --> 11:30.722
we weaken their
entire community.

11:30.723 --> 11:31.657
Or we kill them!

11:31.658 --> 11:33.258
We don't know how strong
this weapon is.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.126
She's right.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.260
And we're not killing Duncan.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.328
No one intends to.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.829
My point is,

11:37.830 --> 11:41.099
we can't find the Ancestor
if we're locked in here.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.133
What are you suggesting?

11:42.134 --> 11:43.201
We bargain.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.537
They let us rescue Lynn,
we find the Ancestor.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.038
So we do risk killing Duncan?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.640
And Silas, and all the others?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.141
We're buyig ourselves tim.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.177
Once Lynn is safe, we can
focus on saving the others

11:52.178 --> 11:53.612
before we destroy the Ancestor.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.613
Or we bluff.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.248
We tell the Obelisk that
we'll find the Ancestor,

11:56.249 --> 11:56.883
then we don't.

11:56.883 --> 11:57.617
Won't work.

11:57.617 --> 11:58.251
They'll know,

11:58.251 --> 11:59.185
and we need their hel.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.886
And their protection.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.954
I don't like it, but I agree.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.556
And what if we fail
rescuing Lynn?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.057
We won't.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.195
We all just need to keep in
mind that Lynn's the mission.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.695
Why are you looking at me?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.297
Just making sure
we agree that Duncan

12:12.298 --> 12:15.000
is not an objective right now.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.201
Time is short for Lynn.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.202
We go for her.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.005
I know what the mission is.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.406
As long as we're clear.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.609
So, we make a deal?

12:24.443 --> 12:25.577
I'm in.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.913
They're going to make us
find the Ancestor anyway.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.048
Can you relay all of this
to the Obelisk?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.250
We're about to find out.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.226
Do you know what this is?

12:42.194 --> 12:45.463
It's 150 people.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.832
A whole community.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.236
Their memories, their DN,
all inside this dron.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.408
You're in here.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.409
Ezra too.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.880
And others you'd recogniz.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.285
Kylie?!

13:06.886 --> 13:07.987
Mommy!

13:09.455 --> 13:10.589
Wha...?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.793
Is this what you've become?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.794
Cruel?

13:16.395 --> 13:18.863
Death is cruel, Lynn.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.131
It rips us

13:20.132 --> 13:24.570
from those we care abou,
and buries them away foreve.

13:27.974 --> 13:32.344
But what if I told you there was
a way to connect with the dead?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.046
To see and feel ther
memories and knowlee

13:35.047 --> 13:36.348
whenever you needed them?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.517
Not with a machine,
but with your mind?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.688
The crystal in your neck...

13:43.689 --> 13:45.390
Always so smart.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.760
The crystal is the mind of an
organism we call "a Companion."

13:48.761 --> 13:53.632
It's a friend, a counselor.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.803
But the human brain
keeps getting in the way.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.173
Reactions are slowe,
decisions are muddle.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.141
There's resistance.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.177
What do you want from me?

14:06.145 --> 14:07.345
The drone and the Sparks

14:07.346 --> 14:10.015
wove the neural pathways
in our brains.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.416
I want to block some of them,

14:11.417 --> 14:13.319
give greater control
to the Companion.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.686
I'm not a brain surgeon.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.887
I can't help you.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.223
I don't need a surgeon, Lynn.

14:17.890 --> 14:25.597
I need a test subject.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.400
You prick yourself.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.002
The Companion does the rest.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.872
Once it's taken rot
and you're one of u,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.273
we can begin with the drone.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.609
You should just stick her
and get on with it.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.078
You underestimate Lynn, Jax.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.647
She always makes
the right choice.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.063
I don't know how to
reprogram the drone

14:58.064 --> 14:59.165
to do what you're asking.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.467
Nor do I know which
neural pathways to close.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.935
If we turn off the wrong ones,

15:03.936 --> 15:06.771
we could paralyze her or
leave her in a vegetative state,

15:06.772 --> 15:07.907
if not kill her outright.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.176
You don't know how, Duncan,
because you haven't asked!

15:11.177 --> 15:13.778
Is there anything the Ancestr
doesn't know, Ja?

15:13.779 --> 15:15.914
The Ancestor knows all,

15:15.915 --> 15:18.016
remembers all, preserves all.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.453
Does the Ancestor understand
the human brain?

15:20.719 --> 15:22.120
Every neuron.

15:22.121 --> 15:25.290
Does the Ancestor understan
the intricacies of this machine?

15:25.291 --> 15:26.624
Do you think, Duncan?

15:26.625 --> 15:27.593
Without question.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.194
Then take this drone
to the Ancestor

15:29.195 --> 15:31.930
and don't come back
until you know everything.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.898
How do we know he won't run,
like before?

15:33.899 --> 15:35.500
Because you'll go with him.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.702
There is no hae
in this communit.

15:37.703 --> 15:41.606
It has no plac.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.275
And Lynn?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.478
The man will come for her.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.813
I certainly hope so.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.748
You're still here.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.230
So that's their response?

16:05.231 --> 16:06.297
One word?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.333
It means "peace."

16:08.334 --> 16:10.268
Full translation:

16:10.269 --> 16:12.538
"I allow you."

16:21.147 --> 16:22.881
We'll be back with Lynn,

16:22.882 --> 16:24.583
or we won't be back at all.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.858
Do you think Yellow was right?

17:07.859 --> 17:11.029
That the only mercy we can
show a Skin Rider is to kill it?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.364
I'm not killing Silas.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.265
I'm not killing Duncan either,

17:14.266 --> 17:16.334
but what if there's
no other way?

17:16.335 --> 17:17.969
There's always a way.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.038
Be the optimist.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.107
I can't kill the
parasite outright.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.809
Silas said that
would kill him too.

17:24.810 --> 17:25.844
But maybe he was lying.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.213
I know my brother.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.181
He wasn't lying.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.215
Then we use Sparks.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.283
They cured Abram.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.685
Good luck trying to
convince Duncan

17:33.686 --> 17:36.155
to take a swim with some Sparks.

17:36.822 --> 17:37.623
Fine.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.904
I thought you were the optimist.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.218
Tasha.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.655
Tasha.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.058
Tasha, it's Abram.

18:15.694 --> 18:20.432
Blink if you can hear me.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.606
Baby.

18:29.808 --> 18:34.679
Looking for something?

18:34.680 --> 18:38.284
My notebook proves that
I was here before.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.188
Maybe there's proof
Tasha was too.

18:44.189 --> 18:48.326
What makes you think your
wife may have been reborn?

18:48.327 --> 18:49.727
Ezra and Lynn.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.496
Feena and Duncan.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.564
There's a pattern of
restoring couples.

18:53.565 --> 18:57.236
I'd hardly call four people a
reliable statistical sample.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.138
Not statistics.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.073
Sociology.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.076
If you want to start a community
and generate offspring,

19:05.077 --> 19:08.112
you need strong,
monogamous relationships.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.682
You don't need monogamy
to create offspring.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.719
No, but you need it to
create stable families.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.522
And you won't have much of a
civilization without those.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.490
Is that why you're
searching for Tasha?

19:19.491 --> 19:23.628
To prove a pattern?

19:23.629 --> 19:26.097
I loved my wife.

19:26.098 --> 19:32.670
My life didn't have much
purpose after I lost her.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.739
Still doesn't.

19:34.039 --> 19:37.076
Your purpose now is to help
restore the human race.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.213
That's my job.

19:42.214 --> 19:47.085
Tasha was my joy.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.855
Do you know if she
can be reborn?

19:51.890 --> 19:55.060
There is something
I'd like to show you, Abram.

20:08.574 --> 20:12.043
My scans confirm that
they died from a virus,

20:12.044 --> 20:15.313
but these graves tell
much more than tha.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.950
There's no gravestone
or marking.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.918
No way of knowing
who's buried here.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.588
I can help.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.529
Her name ws Rosario Hernande.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.165
You can identify these people?

20:34.166 --> 20:38.936
If their DNA matches
what's in my database.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.240
Show me the others.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.047
Here we are.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.283
On the trail, together again.

20:52.284 --> 20:55.153
You must be thrilled.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.988
I'd rather cut out your tongue.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.623
Jax.

20:58.624 --> 21:01.726
Always so charming.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.896
I know what you are, Duncan.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.730
Silas may think you're useful,

21:05.731 --> 21:08.700
but you are more human
than true.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.704
I was sick, Jax.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.574
The human no longer
has hold on me.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.243
And this morning?

21:19.745 --> 21:22.780
I followed you into the woods.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.784
I saw you use the drone to
conjure that human woman.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.320
You think that's funny?

21:29.321 --> 21:32.757
I laugh at your Gestapo
way of thinking.

21:32.758 --> 21:36.928
You saw, but you did not hear.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.465
I was threatening my host.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.936
Don't ever question my loyalty.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.205
Then try this for loyalty.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.773
The knowledge you have
of that drone,

21:48.774 --> 21:51.008
its workings.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.278
You could easily share that
with any one of us.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.680
I could send you
that knowledge, yeah.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.949
Companion to Companion.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.219
But what would yu do with I?

22:01.220 --> 22:03.588
If you put down your staff,

22:03.589 --> 22:05.556
spend your days tinkering
with machines.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.625
Who would bully us, Jax?

22:07.626 --> 22:09.727
Who would growl at u,
if not you?

22:09.728 --> 22:13.499
No, don't deny us that.

22:14.199 --> 22:16.535
Life would lose all meaning.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.879
You kill me,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.449
and the council will kill y.

22:31.483 --> 22:34.186
It's almost worth it.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.489
Walk.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.127
And if you speak,
I will cut out your tongue.

23:27.239 --> 23:32.310
I won't keep bringing you
food if you keep ignoring i.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.545
I know you're starving.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.582
I also know you like venison.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.927
Good, right?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.662
Admit it.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.665
You could get used to this.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.577
You still haven't
chosen to join us.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.245
Still weighing
the pros and cons.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.882
You haven't changed, Lynn.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.884
Wish I could say
the same for you.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.686
You don't know what
you're rejecting.

24:15.687 --> 24:17.089
You could be one
with the Community.

24:17.322 --> 24:18.322
I'm one with my husband.

24:18.323 --> 24:19.423
That's enough for me.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.259
Technically, he's no longer
your husband.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.796
You were married "until death
do you part," remember?

24:25.864 --> 24:27.565
I remember.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.867
I remember you were
his best man.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.303
And I remember the
toast you gave.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.572
But you had everybody
laughing one moment,

24:34.573 --> 24:40.544
and most of us crying the next.

24:40.545 --> 24:44.048
Because everyone knew you
loved your brother.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.651
That's what I remember.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.120
Do you?

24:49.855 --> 24:54.258
I remember my knees shaking,
my voice almost crackin,

24:54.259 --> 24:59.330
my heart pounding.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.100
Because I was weak and fragile.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.835
Now I'm not.

25:05.804 --> 25:06.871
I'm beginning to thk

25:06.872 --> 25:08.952
you're not going to make
the right choice here, Lynn.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.244
I'm never going to
join you, Silas.

25:13.245 --> 25:17.749
I'll never give up who I am.

25:21.386 --> 25:23.654
I didn't want to
have to do that.

25:23.655 --> 25:24.889
You're angry right no,

25:24.890 --> 25:26.123
but when you hae your Companio,

25:26.124 --> 25:27.625
we'll have a god
laugh about thi.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.994
About how much fuss you made.

25:29.995 --> 25:30.995
Sleep well.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.049
Identity unknown.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.120
You don't know
who's buried here?

25:56.121 --> 25:58.156
Their DNA is not in my database.

26:04.996 --> 26:06.297
Adult or child?

26:06.298 --> 26:08.532
Chil.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.568
So they bore children.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.169
Can you guess the
age of the child

26:12.170 --> 26:13.450
based on the skeletal structure?

26:13.939 --> 26:15.707
Perhaps seven years old.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.946
That would mean the settlement
lasted eight years at least.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.415
Unless the Sparks
reconstituted a child

26:24.416 --> 26:26.118
that is not in my database.

26:27.686 --> 26:28.686
Keep going.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.226
We'll mark the ones
that are unknown.

26:37.562 --> 26:40.364
It's strang.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.967
I was one of these people.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.669
Why don't I remember
my life here?

26:44.903 --> 26:48.172
Perhaps your brain state
wasn't recorded here.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.441
April Sprague.

26:51.176 --> 26:53.745
Identity unknow.

27:04.489 --> 27:07.359
Who buried them?

27:07.759 --> 27:09.193
Other settlers?

27:09.194 --> 27:11.095
The people who became
Skin Riders?

27:11.096 --> 27:14.165
Whoever it was, they showed
respect for the dead.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.536
The stones are neatly set,
the bodies neatly laid.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.875
Althea Keller.

27:33.418 --> 27:34.919
Identity unknown?

27:34.920 --> 27:35.420
No.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.888
This one we know.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.629
We're never going
to find them like this.

27:45.630 --> 27:47.064
People leave tracks.

27:47.065 --> 27:47.899
There are no tracks.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.634
It snowed.

27:50.635 --> 27:53.971
And even if we do find them,
they're better armed than us,

27:53.972 --> 27:55.339
more aware of the terrain,

27:55.340 --> 27:57.007
likely holding a
defensible position,

27:57.008 --> 27:58.375
and have a hostage.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.077
They have the advantage,
no question.

28:00.078 --> 28:00.879
Every advantage.

28:00.879 --> 28:01.780
They're a small army.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.949
We're Robin Hood
and Little John.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.117
I'm not that good of a shot.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.552
You're small for Little John.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.454
I'm serious, Ezra.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.256
We need to think about
how we do this.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.192
And be prepared
to pull back if...

28:15.427 --> 28:16.427
If?

28:16.628 --> 28:17.828
If Lynn's already one of them.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.197
Refusing to accept
that possibility

28:20.198 --> 28:21.966
puts us all in danger.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.134
If you and I die
or become infected,

28:24.135 --> 28:25.936
we've done Abram no favors.

28:25.937 --> 28:28.839
Or Silas, or Duncan.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.207
You're right.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.044
If there's nothing we can do,
we'll pull back.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.621
How many?

28:43.622 --> 28:44.755
One, I thin.

28:44.756 --> 28:45.890
He'll warn the others.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.027
He probably already has.

28:58.503 --> 28:59.938
Wait!

29:05.110 --> 29:06.110
Don't!

29:07.445 --> 29:08.646
What's the matter with you?

29:08.647 --> 29:09.847
You were going to kill him!

29:09.848 --> 29:11.015
That's the enemy, Feena!

29:11.016 --> 29:12.950
That's someone controlled
by a parasite.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.551
Who just tried to kill us!

29:14.552 --> 29:16.287
What did you think we were
going to do out here,

29:16.288 --> 29:17.088
ask them nicely?

29:17.089 --> 29:18.489
If we kill him, we gain nothing.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.492
If we follow him,
he might lead us to Lynn.

29:21.726 --> 29:22.860
We keep a safe distance.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.161
We stay out of range.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.930
We see where he leads.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.766
We can track him in the snow.

29:46.284 --> 29:46.885
Get up!

29:46.886 --> 29:48.519
My feet are sore.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
And I need a rest.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.621
You just had one.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.622
An hour ago.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.459
I mean, if you want to carry me,
by all means.

29:57.195 --> 30:00.464
You know, you weren't this
grumpy at the Settlement.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.967
Do you remember that?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.035
You even had a sense of humor.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.870
A weakminded human.

30:06.871 --> 30:07.572
Come on.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.373
He wasn't that bad.

30:09.374 --> 30:13.545
I mean, no Companion, true,
but he had his moments.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.547
Let's take a look, shall we?

30:16.548 --> 30:17.816
For old time's sake.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.051
What are you doing?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.154
Calling up an old friend.

30:29.594 --> 30:30.829
Identify yourself!

30:31.296 --> 30:33.297
You were always jumpy.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.299
That much hasn't changed.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.800
Turn it of.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.007
What is this?

30:42.008 --> 30:44.174
I said turn it off.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.076
Jax versus Jax.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.012
Two powerhouses.

30:47.012 --> 30:47.812
Who will win?

30:47.813 --> 30:49.413
The one with the gun?

30:49.414 --> 30:51.382
Or the one with the B.O.?

30:51.383 --> 30:52.183
All right, all right.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.052
It was all in good fun.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.421
This was a bad idea.

30:57.422 --> 30:59.824
Your wife is far
more interesting.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.428
Ja?

31:27.852 --> 31:29.353
What's wrong with me?

31:29.354 --> 31:31.355
Now, how did you convince her

31:31.356 --> 31:33.690
to fall for a guy like you?

31:33.691 --> 31:34.492
I mean, it...

31:34.493 --> 31:35.993
It couldn't have
been your charm.

31:35.994 --> 31:36.994
What's happening?

31:36.995 --> 31:38.862
So tender, so radiant.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.465
I guess opposites do attract.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.847
Now, where's that
sense of humor?

32:02.887 --> 32:04.621
Man.

32:04.622 --> 32:09.126
You cannot take a joke.

32:09.127 --> 32:13.230
I waited for you to wake up...

32:13.231 --> 32:16.500
so that you could see me
leave you behind.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.402
No.

32:17.403 --> 32:21.839
You can't go to the Ancestor
without me.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.173
Hey.

32:23.174 --> 32:24.174
Hey!

32:47.665 --> 32:49.800
How long did Ezra live here?

32:49.801 --> 32:53.804
I can't tel from the scan.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.806
You identified his corpse.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.941
That means he's
in your database?

32:57.942 --> 33:01.546
His DNA and brain state, yes.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.280
And mine?

33:03.281 --> 33:04.581
And Feena's?

33:04.582 --> 33:05.616
Also.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.685
That's how I knew to let you
in the settlement.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.155
And Tasha?

33:11.156 --> 33:12.890
My wife?

33:12.891 --> 33:14.525
Let's see te other grave.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.227
No.

33:17.228 --> 33:18.795
Answer the question.

33:18.796 --> 33:19.830
Is she in your database?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.298
Yes or no?

33:21.299 --> 33:23.901
Why must you know?

33:23.902 --> 33:29.140
Because I need to know if I
have something to live for.

33:29.374 --> 33:34.244
They're askin' me.

33:34.245 --> 33:39.650
If they can stop feeding you.

33:39.651 --> 33:43.387
Unplug the machines and...

33:43.388 --> 33:51.388
let you pass away peacefully.

33:53.898 --> 34:01.205
How could they ask me that?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.473
They might as well...

34:03.474 --> 34:09.746
just ask me to shut off myself.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.748
What am I without you?

34:18.590 --> 34:25.228
God in Heaven, I've never
asked you for a miracle.

34:25.230 --> 34:29.234
But please...

34:30.768 --> 34:32.804
Please.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.449
Yes or no?

34:45.449 --> 34:50.054
I will answer you, Abram,
by showing you two more graves.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.364
No trail over here.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.165
Great. Now what?

35:02.166 --> 35:06.336
They must have stuck to
the river to throw us off.

35:06.337 --> 35:07.604
How do you know
he went that way?

35:07.605 --> 35:09.406
He could've gone downstream.

35:09.407 --> 35:10.841
If he was heading
to camp originally,

35:10.842 --> 35:12.242
he would have kept going
in that direction.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.645
Unless he was trying to lose us.

35:15.947 --> 35:16.947
Hello?!

35:17.282 --> 35:18.782
Feena, is that you?

35:18.783 --> 35:19.783
Duncan?!

35:19.884 --> 35:20.884
Wait!

35:28.226 --> 35:29.226
It is you.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.163
It's not as bad as it looks.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.832
Although I can't feel my arms.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.168
Don't touch him.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.469
There's more of you.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.804
Good.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.406
We'll need all the help
we can get.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.875
Help?

35:44.876 --> 35:45.876
For what?

35:47.111 --> 35:48.346
For rescuing Lynn.

35:55.653 --> 35:59.489
If your finger slips, I'm dead.

35:59.490 --> 36:05.462
Would you mind putting
the bow down, please?

36:05.463 --> 36:07.931
Stay back, Feena.

36:07.932 --> 36:10.033
What, you think this is a trick?

36:10.034 --> 36:11.401
You need to listen to m.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.837
Not every Skin Rider
parasite is strong.

36:13.838 --> 36:14.706
All right?

36:14.707 --> 36:16.039
There are some of us
who can resist it.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.210
We pretend to be under their
control to keep up appearances.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.611
Why should we believe you?

36:21.612 --> 36:23.580
Look at me.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.882
Beaten to a pulp
and tied to a tree.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.283
If you didn't do this,
then who did?

36:27.752 --> 36:29.553
Why would they do this?

36:29.554 --> 36:32.022
His name's Ja.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.258
He's psychotic,
but he's easily riled.

36:35.259 --> 36:37.627
I made sure that he saw e
speaking to a holoFeea

36:37.628 --> 36:38.463
this mornin.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.529
A hologram of me?

36:39.530 --> 36:40.564
It's a long stor,

36:40.565 --> 36:43.033
but these things nd
to be orchestrated.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.167
All righ?

36:44.168 --> 36:45.535
He doesn't let me go anywhee
by myself anymor.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.771
I had to make se
that Jax left me

36:47.772 --> 36:49.973
because he thought it was
a good idea, not mine.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.008
You wanted him to
smack you around?

36:52.009 --> 36:53.443
No, I wanted him to ditch me.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.479
I didn't think he
would tie me up.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.713
And if he hadn't?

36:56.714 --> 36:58.782
I was coming to you.

36:58.783 --> 37:00.484
You don't know where
the Skin Rider camp is,

37:00.485 --> 37:03.920
and I can't rescue Lynn alone.

37:03.921 --> 37:05.655
Seriously, enough with the bow!

37:05.656 --> 37:06.823
I'm tied up!

37:06.824 --> 37:07.858
You attacked Feena.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.092
I had to!

37:09.093 --> 37:10.627
The other Skin Riders
would have killed her!

37:10.628 --> 37:13.997
It's better she's hurt by me
than dead.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.432
You have a rationale
for everything?

37:15.433 --> 37:19.436
I have a truth for everything.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.071
If you want to leave me here,

37:20.072 --> 37:22.105
that's fine.

37:22.106 --> 37:26.143
But you're never going to
find Lynn without my help.

37:26.144 --> 37:32.115
Maybe he's telling the truth.

37:32.116 --> 37:37.888
Show me your neck.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.490
The parasite's active,
but I can contain it.

37:40.491 --> 37:44.828
I can even prevent it from
speaking to the others.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.363
Where's the camp?

37:46.364 --> 37:48.765
Finding camp is the easy part.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.201
The hard part is getting
Lynn out of that ship.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.903
If any one of them sees,
the others will know.

37:52.904 --> 37:53.970
What ship?

37:53.971 --> 37:57.674
It's an old Karik warship.

37:57.675 --> 37:59.476
Here's the deal:

37:59.477 --> 38:01.178
You tell us how to get Lynn out.

38:01.179 --> 38:04.948
And if what you say checks out,
if you're not lying to us,

38:04.949 --> 38:07.517
we'll come back for you.

38:07.518 --> 38:09.386
If you fail, I'm stuck here.

38:09.387 --> 38:10.288
Not my problem.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.155
We should discuss this.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.656
It's decided.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.090
It's not your decision to make!

38:14.091 --> 38:16.493
Yes, it is.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.494
Camp!

38:17.495 --> 38:18.528
Where is it?

38:18.529 --> 38:19.930
Feena.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.667
Feena, look at me.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.668
You know me.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.640
I am losing my patience.

38:30.641 --> 38:35.279
Where is my wife?

39:11.249 --> 39:17.287
Part of your search for Tasha
is here.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.055
Is it her grave?

39:19.056 --> 39:20.190
No.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.827
The grave of this woman.

39:24.862 --> 39:25.830
Who is she?

39:25.831 --> 39:26.997
You wouldn't remember her.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.665
Your last exchange with her
was brief,

39:28.666 --> 39:30.500
and she was much older.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.702
We spoke?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.271
In my first life?

39:34.272 --> 39:36.806
At the time of Tasha's death.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.675
Shall I show you?

39:38.676 --> 39:40.243
What do you mean?

39:40.244 --> 39:42.579
We call it "deep recall."

39:42.580 --> 39:44.147
I have your brain state.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.583
Every moment of your life.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.886
Including the seemingly
insignificant ones.

39:49.887 --> 39:53.056
You can show me a memory?

39:53.057 --> 39:55.326
Hold very still.

40:26.624 --> 40:31.995
It was a stroke.

40:31.996 --> 40:39.996
They told me there was
nothing more I could have done.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.043
But I'm pretty sure
they tell that to everyone.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.512
Just to help them
sleep at night.

40:49.513 --> 40:52.015
Your memory
continues elsewhere, Abram.

40:52.016 --> 40:58.788
Come.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.758
You'll have to sleep
sooner or later.

41:01.759 --> 41:02.660
That's her.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.995
Eleanor.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.497
That's your fourth cup
of hot cocoa.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.233
It's 2 am.

41:10.234 --> 41:14.137
You either have a very
bad sweet tooth,

41:14.138 --> 41:16.673
or you're fighting
to stay awake.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.676
Maybe both.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.014
When my sister
turned for the worse,

41:24.015 --> 41:28.118
I stayed up for 40 hours
by her bed.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.755
I got so sick,
they almost admitted me.

41:35.059 --> 41:38.795
It's okay to sleep.

41:38.796 --> 41:42.666
I don't think I can.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.235
Because you're afraid.

41:45.236 --> 41:48.338
Afraid that she might pass
while you're sleeping

41:48.339 --> 41:51.074
and she'll think that
you abandoned her.

41:51.075 --> 41:54.978
Afraid she'll be alone
when it happens.

41:54.979 --> 42:02.585
Afraid you'll be alone
when you wake up.

42:02.586 --> 42:05.088
I'd say...

42:05.089 --> 42:09.527
you read people pretty well.

42:12.296 --> 42:15.231
Here.

42:15.232 --> 42:16.833
I just finished.

42:16.834 --> 42:20.070
I can't take your blanket.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.372
I'm a volunteer.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.308
This is what I do.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.210
In some cultures,

42:27.211 --> 42:31.681
the gift of a blanket
initiates blessings.

42:31.682 --> 42:35.318
Rest for the weary.

42:35.319 --> 42:38.221
Dreams for the sorrowful.

42:38.222 --> 42:44.461
Warmth for the lost.

42:44.462 --> 42:47.564
This is very kind.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.332
Thank you.

42:49.333 --> 42:54.871
Places like this,
times like this,

42:54.872 --> 42:57.974
we could all use
a little kindness.

42:57.975 --> 43:00.744
Do you remember this moment?

43:00.745 --> 43:02.378
Of course.

43:02.379 --> 43:05.181
I didn't give it much thought
afterward.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.851
A lot of people were kind to me
when Tasha passed.

43:07.852 --> 43:12.089
Look closely and see what
you failed to see before.

43:25.703 --> 43:27.605
Who is this woman?

43:40.518 --> 43:43.653
I'm asleep?

43:43.654 --> 43:46.289
How can I have a memory of this?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.291
This is not your memory, Abram.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.127
It's hers.

44:02.773 --> 44:04.941
What is she doing?

44:04.942 --> 44:06.510
Watch.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.452
Sparks.

44:24.261 --> 44:26.262
There is nothing to be done.

44:26.263 --> 44:29.232
Even if the Sparks repair the
tissue around the hemorrhage,

44:29.233 --> 44:32.269
there is too much damage
to record a brain state.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.043
I'm sorry.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.895
Sleep a few more hours.

44:58.896 --> 45:02.733
And when you wake,
don't be afraid.

45:10.541 --> 45:14.811
Is that true?

45:14.812 --> 45:17.146
Were the Sparks here
when Tasha died?

45:17.147 --> 45:20.450
Tasha could not be healed,
Abram.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.186
You can make a human being
when you want one,

45:23.187 --> 45:25.455
but you can't heal one
when she needs it?

45:25.456 --> 45:28.858
The damage to Tasha's mind
was too significant.

45:28.859 --> 45:30.093
Her brain state could
not be captured.

45:30.094 --> 45:30.995
I am sorry.

45:30.996 --> 45:33.263
Don't tell me you're sorry!

45:33.264 --> 45:36.199
You don't feel anything.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.433
You're a machine.

45:37.434 --> 45:39.435
I carry your memories, Abram.

45:39.436 --> 45:42.772
They're not mere images;
They include all your emotions.

45:42.773 --> 45:44.607
I grieve with you.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.509
I don't want your grief.

45:46.510 --> 45:49.545
I want my wife back.

45:49.546 --> 45:54.984
Tasha cannot be restored, Abram.

45:54.985 --> 45:56.386
I know where she's buried.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.588
We can recover her DNA.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.923
But not her mind.

45:59.924 --> 46:02.992
Even if we could remake her,
without her brain state,

46:02.993 --> 46:04.594
she would not know you.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.195
She wouldn't know anything.

46:06.196 --> 46:08.631
She'd be an organism,
not your wife.

46:08.632 --> 46:10.566
It wouldn't be fair to her.

46:10.567 --> 46:13.870
If you know me so well,

46:13.871 --> 46:21.412
you should know better than to
lecture me about what's fair.

47:40.891 --> 47:43.893
You think you're the only one
who's losing someone here.

47:43.894 --> 47:45.762
You want to speak louder,
please?

47:45.763 --> 47:47.830
I don't think all the
Skin Riders can hear you.

47:47.831 --> 47:48.931
Duncan can help us.

47:48.932 --> 47:50.199
We can't just leave him there!

47:50.200 --> 47:50.601
Lynn needs...

47:50.602 --> 47:51.667
No.

47:51.668 --> 47:54.470
Don't pretend this has
anything to do with Lynn.

47:54.471 --> 47:55.838
This is about you.

47:55.839 --> 47:57.640
Yeah, it's about me
and what I know.

47:57.641 --> 47:58.308
I know Duncan.

47:58.308 --> 47:59.176
You don't.

47:59.177 --> 48:00.643
This isn't about
what you know, Feena.

48:00.644 --> 48:03.513
It's about what you want,
what you hope for.

48:03.514 --> 48:04.514
I just need more time with him.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.282
I can tell.

48:05.283 --> 48:06.849
We don't have time!

48:06.850 --> 48:08.618
And I'm not letting you
risk my life and Lynn's

48:08.619 --> 48:12.955
on some little lovesick hunch.

48:12.956 --> 48:15.425
You're such a hypocrite.

48:15.426 --> 48:20.264
Love is worth fighting for,
but only if it's yours.

50:25.756 --> 50:27.324
Ezra.

50:58.355 --> 51:03.493
This is starting to feel
like a family reunion.

51:21.245 --> 51:24.981
I told you there were two graves
I wanted to show you, Abram.

51:24.982 --> 51:30.153
You've only seen one.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.297
You're broken, Abram.

51:41.298 --> 51:45.067
New to the world
but broken already.

51:45.068 --> 51:46.502
Life has nothing to offer you

51:46.503 --> 51:53.009
because a life without her
has no meaning.

51:53.010 --> 51:57.179
The thrill of being young,
the novelty of being alive,

51:57.180 --> 52:01.017
has been replaced with the
reality of being alone.

52:01.018 --> 52:03.319
I don't care who's buried here.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.754
You will.

52:04.755 --> 52:12.128
The person here proves
how wrong you are.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.330
You lived in the Settlement,
Abram.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.431
You worked.

52:15.432 --> 52:16.699
You laughed.

52:16.700 --> 52:21.304
Perhaps you even loved again,
bore children again.

52:21.305 --> 52:25.141
I do not know for certain,
but I do know that you lived,

52:25.142 --> 52:26.976
that you found purpose,

52:26.977 --> 52:32.748
that you allowed yourself
to be unbroken.

52:32.749 --> 52:36.153
I hope history repeats itself.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.875
I knew you'd come back.

52:59.876 --> 53:02.678
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

53:02.679 --> 53:03.779
Ezra is right.

53:03.780 --> 53:07.117
You shouldn't trust me
or any of the others.

53:08.352 --> 53:10.753
Let my instructions to Ezra
prove to you that I'm not lying.

53:10.754 --> 53:11.887
You'd rather I leave?

53:11.888 --> 53:13.856
I'd rather you not doubt.

53:13.857 --> 53:18.494
I hate the idea of you
thinking that I'm...

53:18.495 --> 53:19.995
that I'm something else.

53:19.996 --> 53:22.531
Are you?

53:22.532 --> 53:24.333
Yes.

53:24.334 --> 53:27.269
This Companion, it's in me.

53:27.270 --> 53:30.005
I fight it constantly.

53:30.006 --> 53:31.874
It tries to tell me
that I don't love you, that-

53:31.875 --> 53:34.710
that I don't need you.

53:34.711 --> 53:38.914
And the more it says it,
the more I know it's wrong.

53:38.915 --> 53:45.121
But I can't break this alone.

53:45.122 --> 53:53.122
You don't have to.

53:58.301 --> 54:03.774
I've waited a long time
to do that.

54:07.644 --> 54:09.245
If we hurry,
we can catch up to Ezra.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.046
No.

54:10.047 --> 54:11.447
No, you go back
to the Settlement.

54:11.448 --> 54:12.748
I want you safe.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.483
I think you know me better
than that.

54:14.484 --> 54:17.386
Well, at least be careful then.

54:17.387 --> 54:20.490
You don't know how dangerous
these people are.
