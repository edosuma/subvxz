<i> [narrator] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.743 --> 00:11.877
[josh] y'all been seeing
all these hard seltzers
all over the place?

00:11.879 --> 00:13.379
He wants to make hard seltzer.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.847
Trust me, it works.

00:14.849 --> 00:18.550
No, to mix that
peach brandy with water
is something we've never done.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.453
Man, there's a ton of sugar
in there, ain't there?

00:21.455 --> 00:25.958
There's people out there
willing to pay good money
for a top-quality product.

00:25.960 --> 00:26.892
What in the hell?

00:26.894 --> 00:28.093
It's blue.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.129
[mike] that's our still, man.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.897
[jerry] the man who's allowing
us to run up on his property?

00:31.899 --> 00:32.798
He decided to sell it.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.933
It seems like
every time we turn around

00:34.935 --> 00:36.902
<i>  we're having to pack up, move</i>
<i>  and go find somewhere else.</i>

00:36.937 --> 00:37.870
Whoo!

00:37.872 --> 00:40.205
We're gonna run
some liquor now, boys.

00:42.777 --> 00:45.310
<i> [man] this is how we</i>
<i>  make the moonshine.</i>

00:51.752 --> 00:53.218
That's good stuff right there

00:53.220 --> 00:55.854
and I'm not really even
that big a raspberry fan.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.823
[narrator]
<i>  along the carolina border,</i>

00:57.825 --> 00:59.758
<i>  after devising a recipe</i>

00:59.760 --> 01:02.194
<i>  for hard seltzer</i>
<i>  made from moonshine...</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:03.862
[josh] blackberry right there.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.933
<i>  Josh prepares to test market</i>
<i>  the product on his customers.</i>

01:07.935 --> 01:09.101
[josh] there's strawberry.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.669
[brian] boy,
that stuff's pretty.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.138
Me and brian are making
homegrown hard seltzer.

01:13.140 --> 01:13.906
All right, let 'er rip, cuz.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.707
[machine hissing]

01:15.709 --> 01:17.810
<i>  I built this co2 system</i>
<i>  with this pressure cooker</i>

01:17.812 --> 01:19.812
just to try it out
on a small scale.

01:19.814 --> 01:22.548
<i>  I'm gonna sell</i>
<i>  the hard seltzer</i>
<i>  for eight dollars a quart.</i>

01:22.550 --> 01:24.049
<i>  And me and brian</i>
<i>  are gonna find out</i>

01:24.051 --> 01:26.051
if people are actually
gonna really buy this.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.152
Let 'er rip, potato chip.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.420
[hissing]

01:28.956 --> 01:29.655
there it goes.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.524
<i> [josh] homegrown hard seltzer?</i>

01:32.526 --> 01:35.160
<i>  That's something totally new</i>
<i> and something outside the box.</i>

01:35.162 --> 01:38.497
Uses a little bit of alcohol,
stretches it a long way,

01:38.499 --> 01:39.765
makes me a lot of money.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.669
B, if this right
here works out,
we'll make a damn killing.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.138
<i>  Now that we got all</i>
<i>  this hard seltzer made up,</i>

01:46.140 --> 01:47.773
it's time to put this [bleep]
to the test

01:47.775 --> 01:49.741
and see if me and brian are
actually gonna be able

01:49.743 --> 01:51.143
<i>  to take it out there</i>
<i>  and sell it.</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:53.812
<i> I got multiple sales lined up.</i>

01:53.814 --> 01:56.248
And I guarantee you,
I'm gonna get some feedback.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.855
[brian] what are we gonna
say to 'em when we get out?

02:02.857 --> 02:04.256
-[josh] I'll talk to 'em.
-[brian] all right.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.159
I didn't exactly tell
all my customers

02:07.161 --> 02:08.293
when they were
coming to meet me

02:08.295 --> 02:09.795
that I didn't have shine.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.730
-[josh]
<i> good to see you, senor.</i>
<i> -[customer] good to see you.</i>

02:11.732 --> 02:12.731
[josh]
hey look man, we got something

02:12.733 --> 02:15.134
new here we want
you to try out.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.969
Just try it out
and see what you think.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.238
We got blackberry, watermelon,

02:19.240 --> 02:22.407
we got raspberry, strawberry.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.877
This is like nothing you ever
tried before right here.

02:24.879 --> 02:27.045
-[customer] what is it?
-[josh]
well, it's hard seltzer

02:27.047 --> 02:28.180
but see what
you think about it

02:28.182 --> 02:30.983
-before you start judging it.
-[customer] all right.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.085
Try this blackberry.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.992
-That's good stuff there.
-[josh] it's pretty good.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.827
And I ain't charging
as much on it

02:41.829 --> 02:43.829
as I normally do on a cork so

02:43.831 --> 02:44.730
I'll give you a break on it.

02:44.732 --> 02:48.433
Eight dollars a jar
is what we come up with.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.370
-[customer] make me a case of
the blackberry and strawberry.
-[josh] all right.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.739
Hell, yeah.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.141
<i>  I knew the second that</i>
<i>  I sold my first case</i>

02:56.143 --> 02:57.943
<i>  they didn't just buy a jar,</i>

02:57.945 --> 02:59.912
I knew I was in business.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.313
-Hard seltzer.
-Hard seltzer?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.383
That's good,
let's get it in here.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.885
[josh]
<i>  there's definitely a demand</i>
<i>  for this hard seltzer.</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:09.788
<i>  The money's great, but it can</i>
<i>  definitely be better.</i>

03:09.790 --> 03:11.023
I'm gonna have to upscale.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.724
This is a booming market

03:12.726 --> 03:13.792
and I am really
on to something.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.494
<i>  But not on this level.</i>

03:15.496 --> 03:17.863
<i>  There's a way to make</i>
<i>  more money doing this</i>

03:17.865 --> 03:20.232
but I'm definitely gonna
need henry, kenny
and tickle's help.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.351
[tickle] that's good.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.421
[narrator]
<i>  in franklin county, virginia,</i>

03:42.423 --> 03:46.058
<i>  tickle, henry and</i>
<i>  kenny are running</i>
<i>  the last barrels of mash</i>

03:46.060 --> 03:49.962
<i> from the 34 bushels of peaches</i>
<i>  they secured this season.</i>

03:51.465 --> 03:53.298
Here you go, kenny.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.801
<i>  Tell you what, our season's</i>
<i>  been right rough so far.</i>

03:55.803 --> 03:58.503
But things are starting
to look up for us.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.640
-That'll make some
damn good stuff.
-[tickle] damn right.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.642
<i> [henry] you know,</i>
<i>  we've been hammering</i>
<i>  away running peach brandy.</i>

04:03.644 --> 04:06.612
We should get anywhere
from 40 to 48 gallons.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.880
<i>  And that peach brandy</i>
<i>  is so damn good,</i>

04:08.882 --> 04:11.116
you know, you're looking
at $160 a gallon.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.852
Think that should do it.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.321
-All right, let's get this
jewel lit there, henry
-light 'em up, baby.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.825
-There we go.
-Yeah man.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.960
[tickle] yes sir,
she's looking good.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.672
<i> [henry] you know, we've been</i>
<i>  running peach brandy can out</i>

04:33.674 --> 04:34.906
for years and years
and years now.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.042
You know, thousands
of barrels of peach brandy.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.310
You're getting a little
hot here.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.678
We're gonna get it
capped over here.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.780
We've been doing it
for generations now

04:41.782 --> 04:44.249
<i>  and I plan on</i>
<i>  continuing that legacy.</i>

04:44.618 --> 04:45.517
Ain't she pretty?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.718
[tickle] I'm pushing 'em
over a bit harder.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.786
Yeah, yeah,
go ahead and push her.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.222
-Won't be long
till we got something.
-It's coming.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.859
-I'll tell you what though,
we got liquor.
-All right.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.028
-What do you think
about that, henry?
-Beautiful stream.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.896
Damn right.
She's rolling too, boy.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.865
As long as it
turns it out good.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.134
I'll tell you what,
that's some good peach brandy.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.169
This peach brandy,
you can't even hardly tell

05:04.171 --> 05:05.737
you're drinking liquor.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.072
It's that smooth.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.741
God, that smells good.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.977
That right there,
is some mighty fine brandy.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.216
-About 103.
-Yeah, that's perfect.

05:21.889 --> 05:22.421
That is so good.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.822
That is so good.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.691
You don't have
to hog it over there.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.092
[tickle] I know,
he's running off with it.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.060
Do you all want to try it too?

05:28.062 --> 05:28.794
I don't know.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.764
Tell me what
you think of that.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.699
Ooh.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.000
It's good and smooth.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.436
God almighty,
the flavor in there.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.806
Peach brandy is
a high-dollar product.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.574
I reckon that's it,
we done, ain't we?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.076
<i>  But we gotta keep it going.</i>

05:44.078 --> 05:47.346
We ain't quite got ourselves
out of this hole we done dug.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.247
Oh yeah, she's done.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.663
[mark] hell, you've got
every damn scuppernong

06:04.665 --> 06:05.697
in the state
of alabama, ain't ya?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.734
And part of the florida
panhandle too, brother.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.804
You know, we finished
that little run for beaz
that he dubbed "ambrosia."

06:12.806 --> 06:15.574
<i>  and the scuppernongs</i>
<i>  come through great.</i>

06:15.576 --> 06:17.843
Now we wanna make
a scuppernong cognac.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.845
There is a ton of sugar
in there, ain't there?

06:19.847 --> 06:22.481
Man, these are just right,
you scored on these.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.016
<i> [mark] cognac's a</i>
<i>  high-end liquor.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:26.785
There's no reason ours can't
be a high-end liquor

06:26.787 --> 06:29.087
and command
a big price as well.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.423
<i>  People are working again or</i>
<i>  willing to pay good money</i>

06:31.425 --> 06:33.191
for a top quality product.

06:33.193 --> 06:37.763
To be cognac, for real,
it's gotta be like in Italy or

06:37.765 --> 06:40.031
-somewhere...
-From the cognac
region of France.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.701
[narrator]
<i>  in the 16th century,</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:46.004
<i>  the dutch were masters of</i>
<i>  distilling brandy in europe.</i>

06:46.540 --> 06:48.607
<i>  To source the large</i>
<i>  volumes of wine</i>

06:48.609 --> 06:51.576
<i>  they needed to make</i>
<i>  the popular spirit,</i>

06:51.578 --> 06:54.846
<i>  they spent merchant ships to</i>
<i>  the cognac region of France</i>

06:54.848 --> 06:57.215
<i>  to trade directly</i>
<i>  with winemakers.</i>

06:57.785 --> 07:00.452
<i>  French wine, however,</i>
<i>  spoiled easily</i>

07:00.454 --> 07:03.188
<i>  during the long voyage</i>
<i>  back to the netherlands.</i>

07:03.757 --> 07:05.957
<i>  To solve this problem,</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.893
<i>  the merchants supplied</i>
<i>  the region's winemakers</i>

07:07.895 --> 07:12.531
<i>  with copper pots and training</i>
<i>  in double distillation.</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:16.001
<i>  French winemakers quickly</i>
<i>  adopted the techniques</i>

07:16.003 --> 07:18.703
<i>  and developed their own</i>
<i>  double distilled brandy</i>

07:18.705 --> 07:21.673
<i>  worthy of the name cognac.</i>

07:21.675 --> 07:25.744
<i>  Today, the luxurious</i>
<i>  liquor is so popular</i>

07:25.746 --> 07:28.313
<i>  only two percent</i>
<i>  of all cognac produced</i>

07:28.582 --> 07:30.081
<i>  stays in France.</i>

07:30.884 --> 07:34.319
To be a true cognac, beaz,
you have to distil it twice.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.856
So we do a stripping run
in big sloppy,

07:37.858 --> 07:39.624
and get the alcohol
all out the mash.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.660
Then we have to redistil

07:41.662 --> 07:43.962
the alcohol
and the spirit run.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.897
-Okay.
-Then we barrel-age it.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.666
Cognac is double distilled,

07:47.668 --> 07:51.470
number one to up the proof
and concentrate the flavors.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.939
<i>  We're using big sloppy</i>
<i>  on this run because right now</i>

07:53.941 --> 07:55.974
it's the biggest still
we've got that's functional

07:55.976 --> 07:59.811
in our stable
and she makes fine liquor.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.813
I think this'll make
some killer cognac.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.483
Hey, let's
call it killer cognac.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.719
There's probably a few hundred
pounds of scuppernongs here.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.821
<i>  Tell you, if we were gonna</i>
<i>  stomp every one of these,</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:11.289
<i>  we're looking at</i>
<i>  two days' work.</i>

08:11.291 --> 08:13.758
We don't have the time
to dedicate to that.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.994
<i>  So, I brought my chipper</i>
<i>  shredder that we use</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:17.829
<i>  to shred whole corn.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:19.698
Well, if it'll run
through a cob of corn,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.466
a grape ain't gonna
be no problem at all.

08:24.738 --> 08:28.573
-Man, that is great
right there, that is...
-I told you.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.909
-Boy, smell how
good it smells.
-Yeah.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.112
That's getting all the damn
juice and the gritty.

08:34.815 --> 08:38.450
[beaz] well, I am so tickled
you got this sucker.

08:38.452 --> 08:41.052
[mark] this pulled our ass out
of the fire a couple of times.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.523
[beaz] well, we'll be done
with this in no time.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.992
-[digger] yes, we will.
-[beaz] I love this.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.862
<i> [mark] you know, it don't</i>
<i>  matter how hard you work,</i>

08:50.864 --> 08:52.731
you still have to have
some fun doing it,

08:52.733 --> 08:55.901
and there ain't nothing
any more fun

08:55.903 --> 08:58.136
<i>  than pranking beaz</i>
<i>  any chance that we get.</i>

08:58.138 --> 08:59.137
[machine goes off]

08:59.139 --> 09:00.338
what'd you do to it?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.107
This thing just quit.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.942
It didn't lock up, it just,

09:03.944 --> 09:05.410
power went away
and it stopped.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.213
Generator run outta gas?

09:08.849 --> 09:09.814
No, it's full.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.917
I filled it up just
before I cranked it.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.686
Yeah, we ain't even
halfway done yet.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.855
You know,
in a moonshiner's world,

09:16.857 --> 09:18.924
there is something always
that goes south on you.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.327
And this is something
that beaz hadn't been
around enough yet to learn.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.230
I don't see anything in there.

09:25.232 --> 09:29.167
I'm gonna say, all this juice
has fouled the motor up.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.969
You'd think it would be
sealed though, wouldn't it?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.070
Well, beaz.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.072
You know what that means?

09:34.841 --> 09:36.808
Um, I do.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.776
Get them shoes off.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.210
[beaz] okay.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.381
Them feet, they look like they
should be on a damn hobbit.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.119
Beaz thinks, man I'm going to
save the day right here

09:48.121 --> 09:49.821
and I'm going to be a hero.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.623
<i>  And, he's all in.</i>

09:51.625 --> 09:52.991
Head down wide open.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.960
All right, let's see
how this works.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.996
Good lord.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.732
Man, I'm not heavy enough
to smush these good.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.702
Boy, if anybody sees us
doing this crap right here,

10:03.704 --> 10:06.838
we'll be blackballed from
the world of damn liquor.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.741
I just want y'all to know,
this is terrible.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.710
-This sucks.
-It don't look so bad.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.978
You're missing some.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.581
[beaz] yeah, I know.
Well, my feet ain't
fat like y'all's.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.718
Man, this is so slippery,
it's crazy.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.952
Them feet look like
they belong

10:20.954 --> 10:22.220
on a little mouse, don't they?

10:23.023 --> 10:23.555
They do, don't they?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.123
Really?

10:25.592 --> 10:28.760
You know, we know in our mind
that there ain't no way
we're gonna have him

10:28.762 --> 10:31.730
stomp on all these grapes
but he doesn't know that.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.931
We could just
push a joke so far.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.933
We gotta get the work done.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.068
I'm gonna get this
over here for your handle.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.237
Thank you.
Oh perfect man, thanks.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.139
-[machine starts]
-whoa.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.276
-Wow.
-You fixed it.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.712
You think it overheated?

10:47.714 --> 10:50.148
Maybe, or could be
that mark unplugged it.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.584
-[laughs]
-are you kidding me?

10:52.586 --> 10:56.655
This proves beyond a doubt
what you're willing
to do for us.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.823
You know, it's really
a good thing that this

10:58.825 --> 11:00.258
turned out to be just a prank

11:00.260 --> 11:02.627
<i>  because we'd be here</i>
<i>  for three days</i>

11:02.629 --> 11:06.164
if we were waiting on beaz
to stomp all these grapes
with them little bitty feet.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.833
[mark] well, that's a lot
of grape juice.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.570
[beaz] I have never
been this proud
in my entire life.

11:12.572 --> 11:16.408
To me, this is as gorgeous
as a brand new newborn baby.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.911
[digger] all right, beaz,
we gotta gently
lift 'em right up.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.980
-[both grunt]
-[beaz] no kidding.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.448
[digger] all right,
here we go.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.550
[beaz] wow.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.586
<i> [digger] we got all these</i>
<i>  grapes shredded up,</i>

11:28.588 --> 11:29.921
<i>  now we gotta heat</i>
<i>  a little water up</i>

11:29.923 --> 11:32.323
so we can melt
a little sugar in there and

11:32.325 --> 11:34.225
get started on
making this mash.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.133
[mark] all right boys,
let's get that
scuppernongs in the pot.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.635
[digger] here we go.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.103
We're almost there, guys.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.040
Looking good boys,
looking good.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.209
Keep it coming, love.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.412
-Lookee there.
-What you want to do?
Eat that?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.981
All that's sweet as
damn tupelo honey.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.250
You know, to say there's a
little bit of flavor in there,

11:59.252 --> 12:00.785
<i>  that's an understatement.</i>

12:00.787 --> 12:03.822
<i>  It's some of the</i>
<i>  most flavorful grapes</i>
<i>  I've ever seen in my life.</i>

12:03.824 --> 12:05.790
These scuppernongs are great.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.993
Yeast nutrient and some
good champagne yeast.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.295
What you think, killer?

12:10.597 --> 12:13.064
Well, I think it's
gonna be great.
That's what I'm thinking.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.399
<i> [digger] we're ready</i>
<i>  to rock and roll.</i>

12:14.401 --> 12:17.402
We gotta wait about
seven or ten days
for this to get fermented.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.604
And then we're ready
to make some cognac.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.540
[beaz] I think this is what we
would call "done mashed in."

12:22.542 --> 12:24.242
[mark]
let's get the hell outta here.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.826
[mike] just got back
from florida,
off my honeymoon and

12:41.828 --> 12:42.761
you know, I couldn't help but
think the whole damn time

12:42.763 --> 12:44.729
I was down there,
how jerry was doing

12:44.731 --> 12:47.665
and apparently, he's got
something he wants
to talk to me about.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.870
One thought crosses my mind,
that he's not gonna be able
to work with me any more

12:51.872 --> 12:54.939
on account of, you know,
he had bleeding on the brain.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.209
[jerry] thought I
heard you out here.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.811
[mike] what's going on,
brother?

12:59.813 --> 13:03.748
Doing pretty good I guess
for what I've been through,
just trying to take it easy.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.583
You know, it's really good
to see jerry right now.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.584
I hadn't seen him
since the wedding.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.987
<i>  He looks a lot better</i>
<i>  than he did.</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.322
[jerry] I got something
I want to show you.
Come here and check this out.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.993
[mike] that's our still, man.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.095
The man that's allowing us
to run up on his property?

13:17.764 --> 13:18.363
He decided to sell it.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.831
[mike] oh, my god.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.801
How many damn times has this
gotta happen to us, man?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.102
I don't know.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.905
I feel like a damn
broke-leg dog getting
kicked when he's down.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.774
I mean, we can't keep doing
this every damn season, man.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.609
It seems like every time
we turn around

13:31.611 --> 13:34.012
we're having to pack up, move
and go find somewhere else.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.548
I mean, how many more damn
places can a man find?

13:36.550 --> 13:37.382
We're running out of time.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.184
We gotta find
something pretty quick

13:39.186 --> 13:41.853
so we can bust out a few runs
and get some money
back in our pocket.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.822
It's gonna be damn hard
right now at this time of year

13:43.824 --> 13:46.591
to find another still site
just to pop up.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.726
I know, all the
wet weather springs
are starting to dry up.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.663
As much as I'd love to help,
I can't do no backwoods

13:51.665 --> 13:53.464
high hiking,
carrying this stuff in.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.999
You need to rest,
do what you gotta do,

13:55.001 --> 13:57.602
but it would be good if we
could find something quick.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.970
Do you know of anybody?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.438
Not right off the
top of my head.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.840
I'm gonna try to make
a few phone calls.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.742
The thought crossed
my mind, though,
we ran a lot in tennessee.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.544
What do you think about
coming back over that way?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.913
Ugh, I don't like it.
I don't like that idea.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.882
Me and jerry's been running
north carolina this season

14:10.884 --> 14:13.518
simply because our
stash house got raided.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.054
There, that's risky.
Risky business.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.056
[jerry] it means we gotta
move to get stuff going

14:18.058 --> 14:20.225
and things are cooled down
enough, you know, then...

14:20.227 --> 14:21.693
We'll try to make it happen.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.229
<i> [jerry] it's very risky</i>
<i>  for me and mike</i>
<i>  to go back to tennessee,</i>

14:24.831 --> 14:25.864
but that's what we
might have to do.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.932
I'll take care of this end.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.367
Sure, we're gonna
get back in business.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.118
Hey, henry,
sound like somebody
coming down your driveway.

14:48.822 --> 14:50.688
[henry] I'm expecting
a delivery.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.491
-That's mr. Joshua.
-[tickle] lookie yonder.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.026
He usually shows up
with a load of something.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.995
-[henry] yeah, that's true.
-You boys ain't

14:56.997 --> 14:57.962
gonna believe
what I've been up to.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.097
[henry] well, what's up, hoss?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.965
[tickle] what have you
been doing, boy?

15:06.873 --> 15:08.640
[henry] what's up, hoss?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.408
God, I've missed the hell
out of everybody.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.709
-What's going on?
-Stay used to it.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.478
So josh, what did you do
with the shine we sent?

15:13.480 --> 15:16.848
Did it get you back
on your feet?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.349
-It got him back on
one of 'em, anyway.
-One of 'em, anyway.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.985
Boys, y'all ain't gonna
believe what I've
done come up with.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.023
Have y'all been seeing
all these hard seltzers
all over the place?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.791
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.992
-Yeah.
-Low alcohol.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.360
Ten percent.

15:29.829 --> 15:30.728
Ten percent?

15:30.730 --> 15:31.763
Oh, damn. Yeah, yeah.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.997
That's pressured, ain't it?

15:32.999 --> 15:33.831
I heard it
when you cracked it.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.233
What kinda price
can you give that at?

15:35.235 --> 15:38.102
-Well, I'm selling it
for eight dollars a jar.
-[tickle] is it selling?

15:38.104 --> 15:41.272
I've done sold cases
and cases and cases of it.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.674
God damn, man, that's smooth.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.276
-Smells pretty good.
-Got a good smell to it

15:45.278 --> 15:47.445
josh wants to make
hard seltzer.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.549
Now, this is not an idea
that we would've come up with
on our own.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.751
Tell you what, I could see
how that could sell
right there, josh.

15:53.753 --> 15:59.557
But right now, the market
is huge for this stuff.

15:59.559 --> 16:03.027
I've already made a ton
of money just off
this little pot right here.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.997
-You made this?
-I made that out of this.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.565
This little pressure cooker,

16:07.567 --> 16:11.069
it was kind of like
an experiment to see
if it would work.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.205
To go to a larger scale
we're gonna have to use
a different tank.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.941
So my plan is, get rid
of that.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.143
Put it in here.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.678
Let's get down here where
we can take a look at it.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.648
I haven't never tore
one of these apart before.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.618
It really tastes good.
But he did a small
trial run with it.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.188
Can we do it on a
larger scale, I don't know.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.324
Here's what I want to do.
Basically, this is
the concept right here.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.059
Put a beer tap on here

16:35.061 --> 16:40.531
and then hook the co2 tank
up to it. Keeps it carbonated
as it pushes it out.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.233
I say, let's hook
this thing up.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.835
So what are you thinking
about putting in there?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.004
Only the best.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.406
[chuckles] what you calling
the best here, son?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.141
You know what the best is.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.909
It's that peach brandy.

16:51.911 --> 16:52.143
[chuckles nervously]

16:52.178 --> 16:53.678
no.

16:53.713 --> 16:59.717
Henry seemed to be on board
right off until josh mentioned
peach brandy.

16:59.719 --> 17:04.922
You wanna take
our 100 proof peach brandy,
and cut it to ten percent?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.724
How are you gonna
justify all that?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.794
Because I'm stretching
that dollar way on out there,

17:09.796 --> 17:11.996
and it ain't taking
that much work to do it.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.265
Henry's peach brandy is primo.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.300
And we wanna charge
a primo price.

17:16.302 --> 17:19.404
All we gotta do is fix this
apparatus and we're ready
to rock and roll.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.807
Trust me, it works.
I've already done it,
and I've already sold it.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.875
I'm telling you.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.576
<i> [henry] josh has always</i>
<i>  got something going on,</i>

17:25.578 --> 17:28.246
and everything we've done
so far has panned out.
We've made money with it.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.748
<i>  But water touching</i>
<i>  my peach brandy's taboo.</i>

17:30.750 --> 17:36.120
So, I'm very reluctant on
taking and changing the whole
profile of my peach brandy.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.489
When I'm raising hell
about having to do something
I don't wanna do,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.191
what is it you tell me?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.593
-"but son,
you're making money."
-that's it.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.429
That's a whole lot
of good brandy,

17:44.431 --> 17:46.464
high quality brandy,
that we know we can
get a big price out of.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.399
But we can sell that, too.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.536
We're gonna be able to sell
all our liquor to people
we're selling liquor to,

17:51.538 --> 17:54.272
but we're also gonna
be able to hit a lot
of people with this.

17:54.274 --> 17:58.009
And this is gonna make
more money than that
brandy is by itself.

17:58.011 --> 18:02.980
I real can tell that
henry is just seeing this
as something you don't do.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.249
You don't mess
with peach brandy.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.685
These seltzers
are selling big.

18:07.687 --> 18:12.990
And if we can take a product
like what we make
and make one out of it,

18:12.992 --> 18:14.525
it's gotta be better
than what's in the store.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.829
What I think is we're gonna
be able to take
that quality of something

18:17.831 --> 18:19.864
and hit a different
demographic of people.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.399
I'll tell you what, henry.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.634
Now, how can you argue
with making more money?

18:23.636 --> 18:26.003
-Can't argue with that.
-Do you need
any more convincing?

18:26.005 --> 18:29.474
He took
just our regular liquor

18:29.476 --> 18:30.808
and made something
this good off of it.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.678
I understand that, it's just
this thing we've always had

18:33.680 --> 18:36.948
about putting water
in our brandy, man.
It's just been taboo.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.716
[tickle] well, well,
it ain't brandy no more.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.119
Hey, we still got
brandy left over.
That's the whole thing.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.187
It only takes
so much brandy to make it.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.756
[tickle] it's not like he's
asking for all the brandy.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.827
That's something anybody
can drink. Even people that
don't drink would drink that.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.830
That is good. I have to admit,
that is extremely good.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.465
Sometimes it's hard to teach
an old dog new tricks.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.501
I think it's worth
taking a gamble.

18:56.503 --> 19:00.805
-They seem to be on your side,
with you doing it, too.
-I say we give it a shot.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.341
All right. Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Y'all convinced me.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.409
<i> [josh] so we're gonna</i>
<i>  make the hard seltzer</i>

19:05.411 --> 19:07.778
with that killer peach brandy,
and we're gonna charge
a killer price.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.314
[tickle] I need a little
more convincing, henry,
I don't know about you.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.717
[henry] I just don't like
putting water with that
peach brandy.

19:12.719 --> 19:17.755
If we don't get this recipe
down right, and this
doesn't turn out good,

19:17.757 --> 19:19.757
henry's gonna be
one upset moonshiner.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.259
All right, let's rock, boys.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.404
[mike] you know, I'm
basically out of
options right now.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.207
Our still site was basically
sold out from under us.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.410
Bad as I hate to,
I've gotta go ask daniel
for some damn help.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.080
You know, me and daniel,
we were the best of friends.
We were like brothers.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.983
<i>  We've had some bad blood</i>
<i>  in the past, but you know,</i>
<i>  time heals wounds.</i>

19:45.985 --> 19:49.854
<i>  And I figured if anybody</i>
<i>  knows around this area</i>

19:49.856 --> 19:51.889
<i>  where a good</i>
<i>  still site may be,</i>

19:51.925 --> 19:52.957
it could be him.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.859
What are you doing, daniel?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.427
Hell, riding around
with the top down.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.829
Heard that.
Long time no see.
How you been, brother?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.665
I am as busy
as a two-pecker pup.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.799
[both laughing]

20:01.801 --> 20:05.603
well, that's busy. I heard
that, I'll tell you what.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.738
Well, I just got back from
my honeymoon,

20:07.740 --> 20:10.875
and I come in to find out
that our still site's
been burned.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.678
The guy just up and
sold the damn land
out from under me.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.714
And we've had a misfortunate
incident with jerry.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.916
He's been piled up
in hospital,

20:18.918 --> 20:20.952
and he's in pretty rough
damn shape.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.753
That is some
bad circumstances.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.855
Regardless of what's ever
been said or done,

20:24.857 --> 20:29.093
I'm running out of damn
options here, and I don't have
any damn where else to go.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.795
We got a long
damn past together,
that's for damn sure.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.663
Yeah, a long one,
that's for sure.

20:32.665 --> 20:36.801
With all that being said,
the question I have for you

20:36.803 --> 20:41.639
and the reason I am here
is to see, do you know of any
damn where in this country

20:41.641 --> 20:45.409
that I could set up
and be safe
on a damn still site?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.646
Somewhere to set up with
all the elements.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.482
You got running water,
you're gonna have people.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.584
-Yeah.
-And you, it's gotta
be somewhere where

20:53.586 --> 20:56.454
a lot of people don't know
about that running water.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.456
That's getting hard to find
any more with
the population, huh?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.024
Mmm-hmm.

21:00.026 --> 21:05.162
Everybody thinks that you
just stick a pot out there and
fill it full of mash,

21:05.164 --> 21:06.664
and make liquor.
It's not that easy.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.635
<i>  It's hard on a moonshiner</i>
<i>  to find a good place</i>
<i>  to run moonshine.</i>

21:10.637 --> 21:13.471
I just figured
you might know a spot.
I know there's one out there.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.672
-Finding it is the thing.
-Yeah.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.408
-You can't just set a still
up anywhere.
-That's right.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.978
-You've gotta have all
your resources you need.
-You got to.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.483
The only ones that I know
around here, close,
is being used.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.552
But, now, there may be
a few more around.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.455
<i> [mike] you know, I don't know</i>
<i>  if daniel is wanting to help</i>
<i>  me right here, right now.</i>

21:31.457 --> 21:33.124
You know, I just floated
the question out there to him.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.459
He seems like he's
hem-hawing around
just a little bit with me.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.563
You know, truthfully, mike,
I know these woods right here
like the back of my hand.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.700
I've hunted about all
these hills and
hollers around here.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.802
And there ain't no
damn body in this world

21:44.804 --> 21:46.971
ever make it through
this world without help.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.007
And I'm gonna give you
something to go look at.

21:51.377 --> 21:52.777
It's got killer water,

21:52.812 --> 21:56.580
and it's a damn good holler
to run liquor in,
one way in, one way out.

21:56.582 --> 21:59.016
And you've seen it,
and you've been there with me.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.752
That was several years back
at pawpaw patch.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.653
And we went to pick pawpaw.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.622
I remember damn well.

22:04.624 --> 22:08.459
But if you go all the way up
in the head of that holler,
past that pawpaw patch,

22:08.461 --> 22:11.796
in that left-hand holler,
you'll find a damn good
water source.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.699
Right in there is a fine spot
to put a still site.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.069
But there it is.
There's your tip. Try that.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.737
Brother, I appreciate it.
I owe you the world, man.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.238
Thank you so much.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.941
In the past, I probably
wouldn't have helped
mike at all.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.478
But he's down and out,
and he needs to set up and
get to making some liquor.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.914
I tell you what though,
you'd better hurry up.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.084
Because at this time,
we ain't got much longer
to do it.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.119
Nope. Time's a-wasting,
that's for sure.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.420
Well, I appreciate you,
brother.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.956
You know I feel like I'm on
the right track, right now.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.592
It's giving me somewhere
to go, somewhere to look at.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.728
<i>  Something I didn't have</i>
<i>  a few minutes ago.</i>

22:43.730 --> 22:46.430
So here I go. I'm gonna check
this place out.

22:59.812 --> 23:03.781
Yeah, if we can make
this thing work,

23:03.783 --> 23:05.316
I don't see no reason
not to try.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.719
<i> [josh] I was able to convince</i>
<i>  henry, kenny and tickle</i>

23:08.721 --> 23:10.855
with this idea
to make this hard seltzer.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.824
If you don't take a chance,
you're not gonna make
no money.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.093
There's no way I could use my
little bitty crock pot

23:16.095 --> 23:19.430
to be able to make anything
on any scale.

23:19.432 --> 23:23.434
So I got to thinking
that I could take a beer keg,
and modify this thing.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.569
So we can fill it up,
and carbonate my drink.

23:25.571 --> 23:29.473
But I'm gonna say one thing,
I will kill you
if he screws up this brandy.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.476
If it don't work out,
take it out of my cut,
straight up.

23:32.478 --> 23:35.379
How do we build
this thing, josh,
that's what I'm mostly about.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.489
[josh] all right,
so, see there's
a little beer in there.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.092
[henry] mmm-hmm. I smell it.
Nasty.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.961
We're gonna let all
that rotten beer
and all that pressure off.

23:50.963 --> 23:56.267
We're building us
a co2 infusion machine
to make hard seltzer.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.668
Now we can drill a hole in it,

23:57.670 --> 24:00.438
hook this up to a nipple
with freaking little valve
on it.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.775
We're gonna put one spout
on this thing that will be
for nothing more

24:04.777 --> 24:08.913
than putting product
in this thing and wash
this thing out between uses.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.449
We can drill a hole
and slide that into it

24:11.451 --> 24:13.384
and it'll be down in there,
like that right there.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.585
We're gonna put a tube

24:14.587 --> 24:17.321
that goes all the way
down to the bottom
of this thing.

24:17.323 --> 24:23.461
What that'll do is it'll put
the carbon dioxide inside
the product inside this keg.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.664
Then we can just cut it off,
hold the pressure in it
and be carbonated.

24:26.666 --> 24:33.137
This beer keg is a very
integral part of this build,
because without pressure

24:33.139 --> 24:39.643
the co2 will not infuse
into our hard seltzer product
that we've got in here.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.946
We're looking for our drill,
our grinder...

24:41.948 --> 24:44.281
-You need a tape measure?
-No.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.685
-How about this hammer?
-No.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.020
-Needle-nose vise-grips?
-No.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.189
-How about that pencil?
-Let me think. No.

24:52.859 --> 24:53.624
[bleep]

24:53.626 --> 24:55.359
[laughing]

25:00.032 --> 25:05.903
the design of this beer keg
josh had, it's genius
and it's simple.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.672
-Yeah.
-That'll work right yonder.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.875
This is where we fill it
and where we drain it at.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.409
We got that water proofed.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.212
Now, we gotta pressurize
it somehow, right?

25:15.214 --> 25:20.584
Then this will slide
all the way down into
the bottom right there.

25:20.586 --> 25:25.322
It's important that the air
goes into the liquid.
Put a beer tap on, right?

25:26.125 --> 25:27.424
Boom.
That thing's ready to roll.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.294
We finally got
this machine built.

25:33.666 --> 25:37.668
Now it's time to test
this thing and we're just
gonna see how it works.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.869
Y'all ready to see
what this thing does?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.437
[henry] here's the
liquid gold, boys.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.407
[josh] me watering down
henry's liquor?

25:43.409 --> 25:47.077
If that don't work out,
I'm never gonna hear
the end of this.

25:48.581 --> 25:51.582
I got a 400-foot
well dug here.
This is not town water.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.651
-There's no chlorine
in this water.
-Yeah.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.386
It's some of the best
water you could ever
drink right there,

25:55.388 --> 25:57.488
so I don't mind
using that for our mix.

25:57.490 --> 26:00.758
-Yeah, you ain't gonna
go wrong with that.
-That oughta about do it.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.394
All right. Put some fruit
in it, and freaking,

26:03.396 --> 26:04.895
let that marinate
a little bit.

26:04.897 --> 26:08.933
I mean, we already
got peach brandy. Do we really
need more peach flavor?

26:08.935 --> 26:11.268
I mean that liquor right
there oughta flavor it good.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.670
We'll put all the flavor
to it we can.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.539
The taste profile
on that right there
is probably gonna go way down

26:15.541 --> 26:18.609
when you add that water to it,
so we'll put some
extra flavor, you know.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.745
-Okay.
-You don't know how nervous I
am about trying this, do you?

26:21.747 --> 26:24.748
-Let 'er rip, potato chip.
-That hurt me.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.818
<i> [josh] the first step in</i>
<i>  making a hard seltzer's</i>
<i>  taking the liquor</i>

26:27.820 --> 26:30.888
and diluting down to 20 proof
with spring water.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.190
-[kenny] gosh,
that's hurting, ain't it?
-[henry] that hurt me.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.926
Yep, that's hurting.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.094
Never thought I would see you
do that, henry.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.229
-[all laughing]
-please don't
track us down, daddy.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.901
Daddy seen me pouring brandy
over in water, he'd kill me.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.636
-[josh] that's what
I'm talking about.
-Here you go.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.972
And it smells good, don't it?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.907
Oh, god. Daddy's probably
strike me down if he saw me

26:49.909 --> 26:52.409
pouring all that good peach
brandy into water.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.644
-That's all we need.
-[tickle] I'll tell you what.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.280
-I'm smelling it.
-Oh, that's perfect, baby.
That's perfect.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.516
It ain't perfect yet. We can't
carbonate it like that.
We gotta flavor it, still.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.018
[tickle] all right.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.820
[henry] I know you and
tickle's always
packing knives.

27:02.822 --> 27:03.887
Yes sir.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.255
She's sharp, too, boy.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.825
Yeah, I'd say
that's going all right.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.794
[henry] why is kenny's such
big chunks and yours are such
little bitty ones, tickle?

27:10.796 --> 27:12.863
[kenny] my knife's sharper.
[tickle] how big is his?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.064
[henry] yours are
little bitty tiny ones.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.033
Josh, you've cut all
the peach off of it.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.334
[josh] oh, give me a break.

27:17.770 --> 27:21.739
[laughing]

27:21.741 --> 27:23.107
hold on, it won't come out.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.175
[josh] like a sword in it.
[both] excalibur!

27:25.177 --> 27:26.577
[chuckling]

27:26.579 --> 27:29.647
I don't guess there's but
one thing better than
good old peach brandy,

27:29.649 --> 27:33.350
-and that's my mama's peach
cobbler. Oh, my goodness.
-[tickle] I'll tell you what.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.486
What do you say,
daddy making liquor out of it,
mama making cobbler.

27:35.488 --> 27:38.689
-[henry] mama making cobbler.
-[laughing] ain't nothing
wrong with that.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.159
And they used to say that
because we were all kind
of bunch of peaches.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.761
-Uh-huh.
-Same time that we're making
the brandy.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.929
Mm-hm.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.564
-That's exactly what momma--
-that's exactly
what she doing.

27:47.566 --> 27:48.766
Exactly.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.834
That's gonna make
some good stuff,
I can tell you that.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.070
We'll make us a top with like
this on it.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.039
[tickle]
it does look like a pumpkin.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.007
-Like a lid?
-Yeah, like a lid

27:57.009 --> 27:57.975
-for peaches.
-Yeah.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.710
That would do good.

27:59.712 --> 28:00.978
Advertise your product.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.446
We don't have to advertise.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.048
They see us coming,
they know what it is.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.450
-[mumbling indistinctly]
-they know what it is.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.751
Mean peach.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.753
-The juice coming out of--
-coming on out.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.055
-I'd be dogged, if it ain't.
-Mm-hm.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.792
-It was very clear,
wasn't it now?
-Taste it now.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.727
What do you think
of the flavor of that?

28:16.729 --> 28:18.295
-Oh, yeah.
-Think it's good.

28:19.298 --> 28:19.797
Tastes much better.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.432
Sweet.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.434
-Boys, I believe that's
getting close to enough.
-Yeah...

28:23.436 --> 28:24.735
I think it might be.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.304
Put a bunch of peaches in it,
let it soak.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.139
It'll be good and ready to go.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.375
-Gonna be some good stuff.
-[tickle] gonna be
just peachy, ain't it?

28:45.624 --> 28:46.990
Heh heh.

28:47.393 --> 28:51.495
Yeah, heading over
to this pawpaw patch that
daniel told me about.

28:51.497 --> 28:55.032
So we're going up that hollow,
see what it's got to offer.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.400
You know, I hadn't been back
to this place in years.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.570
I'm gonna go down here
and check it out,
and see what I can't find.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.906
<i>  It means a lot to me that,</i>
<i>  you know, daniel come over,</i>
<i>  and give me this advice.</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:04.975
<i>  He didn't have to</i>
<i>  even bring it up to me.</i>

29:04.977 --> 29:09.980
But he did. Maybe
it's potentially set me on
the right damn path right now.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.317
Old pawpaw tree right here.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.887
This is actually
one of the ones
me and daniel picked from.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.857
-There's one right there
big as a tater.
-We're getting a bunch now.

29:19.859 --> 29:20.858
Yes, sir!

29:20.860 --> 29:24.361
Mmm. Smell of these brings me
back to childhood.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.932
I'll be darned. Ohh!

29:28.934 --> 29:32.569
That's a good pawpaw.
This one's ripe. I'm actually
gonna cut it open.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.271
Look how soft that thing is.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.709
By god, that's good eatin'
right there.

29:38.711 --> 29:41.779
Although women used to
make bread and stuff
out of them.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.280
That'll make that liquor,
right there.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.349
But anyhoo.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.851
I can't believe I found
that one hanging there.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.788
There ain't a pawpaw in
this country to be found
right now. [laughs]

29:50.790 --> 29:52.156
that's crazy.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.458
But, I definitely feel like
I'm on the right track.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.727
There's a hollow right up here
to my left.

29:56.729 --> 29:59.563
You know,
I just got to step off
to the unknown now,

29:59.565 --> 30:02.533
and go and find what daniel
was talking about.

30:02.535 --> 30:04.935
Yeah, I feel like a man
chasing a damn rainbow.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.938
<i>  With a pot of gold at the end</i>
<i>  of it nobody's ever</i>
<i>  damn found.</i>

30:07.940 --> 30:10.974
Well I intend to find
that pot of gold here today.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.213
Whoo-hoo! Boy, there is water
right here.

30:18.017 --> 30:18.615
[exclaims]

30:18.617 --> 30:21.018
damn. My god, that's cold.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.288
This water runs all the time.
There ain't no question
about that.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.425
Damn.
I'm on a damn power line.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.927
I can't run liquor
under power lines.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.597
The power company come
down here cleaning up,
doing their job, you know.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.466
That's a good way to just
get seen or get told on.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.535
I'm gonna head on up
the hollow,
see what I can find.

30:38.537 --> 30:43.140
Damn. Yeah, I'm just gonna
keep following this branch up
stream, see what I find.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.876
<i>  But I don't know,</i>
<i>  'cause if there's</i>
<i>  power lines up there,</i>

30:45.878 --> 30:47.611
this is not gonna work.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.380
If I draw daniel a white line,
it's a long way
up through here.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.155
Looks like the end of road
for me.

30:58.157 --> 30:58.922
[shuts door]

30:58.924 --> 31:01.758
but I hear the sweet sound
of water.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.861
It's some old growth
in here in these woods.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.464
Big trees. Probably ain't
too many people been back
in here.

31:08.267 --> 31:12.269
That water. I can hear
it getting closer and closer.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.405
<i>  You know, I can hear</i>
<i>  the water rushing by as I'm</i>
<i>  walking through these woods.</i>

31:15.407 --> 31:18.876
Can't help but think,
you know what, I think
I may be onto something.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.511
Holy mother of pearl!

31:21.513 --> 31:25.883
My god! That is pure beauty.

31:25.885 --> 31:29.920
And bam! There it is,
this humungous 70-80 foot

31:29.922 --> 31:31.622
waterfall. Whoo!

31:31.624 --> 31:32.756
[laughing]

31:32.758 --> 31:35.025
<i>  I'm just about</i>
<i>  damn speechless.</i>

31:35.027 --> 31:37.227
<i>  All the water in</i>
<i>  the world that I need.</i>

31:37.229 --> 31:39.863
No power lines.
No sign of nobody.

31:39.865 --> 31:40.697
I do believe

31:40.699 --> 31:43.200
I found mine and jerry's
still site.

31:43.202 --> 31:47.304
I've never seen anything
so breathtaking in my whole
entire life. Whoo!

31:47.306 --> 31:49.439
We're gonna run
some liquor now, boys!

32:06.825 --> 32:08.392
[mark] well, it's still here.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.968
[all laughing]

32:17.970 --> 32:21.705
[digger] man, there's alcohol
in it and it still got
plenty of great flavor.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.974
[mark] you know what this
means, don't you boys?

32:23.976 --> 32:24.975
[digger] we're gonna have some
fine liquor.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.610
[mark] I says get going.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.845
You know our scuppernong
mash is ready.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.447
It's ready to go.
We're gonna run it today.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.149
Here goes nothing.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.520
<i> [mark] we have two stills</i>
<i>  here. We're gonna do</i>
<i>  the stripping run</i>

32:36.522 --> 32:39.623
to take the alcohol from
the mash on big sloppy.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.259
<i>  Then we'll go straight</i>
<i>  to the small still with that</i>

32:42.261 --> 32:45.696
spirit and do
the spirit run which is
the second distillation.

32:45.698 --> 32:46.964
[beaz] nice.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.566
<i> [mark] we've decided</i>
<i>  we're not using a thumper.</i>

32:49.568 --> 32:51.668
Since it has
to be re-distilled anyway.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.971
<i>  We just simply want</i>
<i>  all the volume we</i>

32:53.973 --> 32:57.040
can get out of it
in as short a time
as we can do it.

32:57.576 --> 33:01.044
Beaz, I'll have to say,
old buddy,

33:01.046 --> 33:05.782
you're turning into
an outstanding liquor man.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.985
[beaz] I'm enjoying seeing
this whole process 'cause

33:07.987 --> 33:09.419
like I said, it's my first

33:09.421 --> 33:12.422
double distillation to do.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.925
<i> [digger] the reason</i>
<i>  cognac is more of</i>
<i>  a premium liquor</i>

33:14.927 --> 33:18.562
is the fact that
it's double distilled
and it's barrel aged.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.897
<i>  Now the double distillation.</i>

33:20.899 --> 33:24.267
That brings more of
the floral flavor to the fruit
to the front.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.972
[beaz] hey, look.
Look at that.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.675
<i>  I got a coon pecker.</i>

33:31.677 --> 33:34.711
[digger] you don't know
which end's up on that
little rascal.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.447
[beaz] see, it looks
like it's working.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.682
[digger] that's what
she never said.

33:38.684 --> 33:42.152
All right, boys, all we got's
time now.

33:42.154 --> 33:46.023
[mark] why don't you
kick that power up just a dab.
That can run a little harder.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.128
[mark] oh, hell.

33:51.964 --> 33:53.096
[digger]
them blow the pecker out?

33:53.098 --> 33:54.164
No.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.433
What in the hell?

33:56.435 --> 33:58.035
It's blue!

33:58.037 --> 33:59.269
God dang it!

34:00.806 --> 34:02.239
[beaz]
what causes that?

34:02.841 --> 34:04.241
[mark] I don't know.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.711
<i>  All of our distillate, blue.</i>

34:07.713 --> 34:09.179
That's all you
can say about it.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.214
It's not clear. It blue.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.050
Son of a bitch!

34:24.863 --> 34:27.431
[mark] I hate this [bleep].
Look at it.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.366
That looks worse
than your [bleep].

34:29.368 --> 34:31.368
<i> [digger] when you look in</i>
<i>  you see your liquor</i>

34:31.370 --> 34:34.871
<i>  turning blue, that's when</i>
<i>  you don't clean</i>
<i>  your copper good.</i>

34:34.873 --> 34:38.075
That sends mark off
the rails because
his forte is the copper.

34:38.077 --> 34:41.078
So that being said,
we dropped the ball here.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.281
[beaz] and so
it's from?

34:45.584 --> 34:48.118
[mark] I don't know
what it's from.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.053
[digger] I got a pretty idea
though, it's just

34:50.055 --> 34:52.022
canker... It's... It's

34:52.024 --> 34:53.223
tarnish that gets on copper.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.358
God damn it!

34:55.360 --> 34:59.329
Your cleaning solution
and fill it up, that's what
it comes out looking like.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.964
[mark] so in this instant,

35:00.966 --> 35:05.102
our damn cognac liquor is
the cleaning solution.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.371
Sadly enough.

35:09.875 --> 35:10.774
[mark] that's
a rookie mistake,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.042
is what it is.

35:12.044 --> 35:13.577
[beaz] yeah.
I'm surprised you all
weren't on top of that.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.378
[mark] that's
a rookie mistake.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.818
It'll happen to
the best of us. You can't
cry over spilled milk.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.221
No, but I wanna cry
over blue liquor.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.723
I say we just dump it out.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.625
[digger] let's just dump it.
Stop the run right there.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.827
Dump the damn stuff,
shut her down.
I ain't gonna let--

35:30.829 --> 35:32.963
I'll help you dump it.
Hold my food coloring.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.099
You son of a bitch!

35:36.301 --> 35:40.070
[all laughing]

35:40.706 --> 35:43.840
-really?
-Yes, really.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.009
-You're welcome.
-[mark] it oughta have been
our turn.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.711
-[digger] yep.
-Damn!

35:47.713 --> 35:49.779
You're official now.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.182
100 million
pounds of scuppernongs.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.918
Spent some money on that.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.954
550 miles in the car.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.990
Spent money on that.

35:59.992 --> 36:03.059
Blue food coloring
for dollar tree.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.529
Priceless. I owed y'all.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.696
[mark] yes, you did.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.633
[beaz] and I knew
we were gonna run that again.

36:09.635 --> 36:13.904
So I knew it'd pull that
food coloring right out of it.
So...

36:13.906 --> 36:16.106
We were fixing to waste
some of this liquor
'cause of you.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.274
We was fixing to dump it out.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.409
[beaz laughing]

36:19.845 --> 36:21.344
good job, man.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.580
-Well, thank you.
-I guess we deserve that.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.814
I reckon.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.750
You know to say that
we had one coming,

36:26.752 --> 36:29.786
yeah we had... We got
a half a dozen coming
at least.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.588
[mark] look at that
friggin' blue liquor.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.656
[beaz] that's gorgeous.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.825
What dumbass
didn't clean their still?

36:35.827 --> 36:38.261
<i> [digger] we're gonna pull</i>
<i>  this liquor right over here</i>
<i>  to the other still</i>

36:38.263 --> 36:39.596
to do our spirit run.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.866
And after that we get into
the hearts,
we'll give her a taste,

36:42.868 --> 36:45.936
<i>  and let beaz go away</i>
<i>  with his chest pulled out</i>

36:45.938 --> 36:48.371
<i>  that he pranked mark</i>
<i>  and digger for a change.</i>

36:48.373 --> 36:51.308
[mark] let's cap her off,
baby, man.

37:02.621 --> 37:05.989
Let's start with the
first bucket 'cause it's been
marinated the longest.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.525
[tickle] all right. Yeah.
I can see a color change
in that.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.528
Can we reuse these peaches?
We could make a pie out of it
or something.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.598
We put some peaches
in it to add some extra
flavor to it.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.667
-[henry] looks good.
-[tickle] still got
some stuff in it.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.537
-[henry] think we need
to strain some more?
-Yeah, I think we do.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.806
<i> [henry] we decided to use</i>
<i>  my peach brandy.</i>

37:22.808 --> 37:24.941
I'm still a little bit
reluctant about doing all.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.910
[henry] put the
cheese cloth right in
the bottom of it.

37:26.912 --> 37:27.978
[tickle] yeah right here.

37:27.980 --> 37:28.979
Like that,
you know what I mean?

37:28.981 --> 37:31.448
After we filter
this stuff out,

37:31.450 --> 37:35.151
we put it inside our co2
infusion machine.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.787
-Don't spill it.
-I believe it's gonna
spill everywhere.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.522
Get it.

37:39.524 --> 37:40.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's pouring out the bottom.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.693
Hey, stay over here.
Stay over here.
Stay over here.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.962
<i> [henry] talking about mixing</i>
<i>  it with all that water,</i>

37:45.964 --> 37:48.198
is something we've never done.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.001
-Yeah.
-You can't just dump it.

37:51.069 --> 37:51.901
There we go.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.937
We wouldn't even
want a drop of

37:53.939 --> 37:56.439
sweat to drop off our hat
into our brandy but

37:56.441 --> 37:57.807
we'll give it a shot and see.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.876
[tickle] right. So we shut
this valve off right here

37:59.878 --> 38:01.111
where we just
filled that up, right?

38:01.113 --> 38:03.913
Put this hose
on here like so.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.749
Now we got our stuff in here.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.851
We're putting the co2 to it.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.319
[tickle]
let's turn the gas on.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.923
<i> [josh] if this doesn't</i>
<i>  work out, me watering</i>
<i>  henry's liquor down,</i>

38:13.925 --> 38:16.359
boy, have I screwed up
big this time.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.996
-Imma hear it bubbling.
-She's bubbling.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.698
<i> [tickle] josh is over here</i>
<i>  controlling the gas.</i>

38:21.700 --> 38:23.733
He starts carbonating.

38:23.735 --> 38:24.834
She's damn sure
bubbling through it.

38:24.836 --> 38:25.402
<i>  It hits 12 pounds.</i>

38:25.404 --> 38:26.836
Josh keeps carbonating.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.439
How... How do you know
how much pressure
you're putting in this thing?

38:29.441 --> 38:31.708
-It ain't gonna
blow up on us, is it?
-I hope it don't.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.910
-Me too.
-[josh] right there is 18.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.412
<i> [tickle] it hits 18 pounds.</i>

38:35.414 --> 38:36.746
Josh keeps carbonating.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.982
Here just look...
Here, come on, back up a bit.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.784
<i>  It hits 25 pounds.</i>

38:40.786 --> 38:42.352
Josh keeps carbonating.

38:42.354 --> 38:43.853
[tickle] I'd shut her down
right yonder.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.755
[josh] how's it holding up?
See any cracks,
anything bulging?

38:45.757 --> 38:46.956
[tickle] it ain't
going nowhere.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.926
I read on this thing.
It says, do not go over.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.929
[josh] 60 psi. We got a
long way to go.

38:52.931 --> 38:57.033
Now I know it says,
do not go over 60 psi

38:57.035 --> 38:59.969
all right, that's all good
and fine. But now

38:59.971 --> 39:03.073
we welded stuff
through this.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.274
How much pressure
you got in it?

39:04.776 --> 39:06.076
30 pounds.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.812
-Shut it down josh.
-You got 30 pounds.
I'd shut that down.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.647
These guys are all
freakin' out. But I want
as much

39:10.649 --> 39:12.849
pressure on
this thing as I get.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.019
-[tickle] how much psi
is your weld gonna hold?
-Let's shut if off.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.654
One of them things come
out of there, it's a bullet.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.155
I'm gonna turn it off.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.926
-It ain't got no--
-[tickle] god almighty!

39:22.928 --> 39:25.428
That thing done spurted up
there 20 feet.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.629
Alright, that comes out
of your part.

39:26.631 --> 39:27.997
Yeah, that comes out of
your part.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.066
<i> [josh] we've got it</i>
<i>  pressurized.</i>

39:30.068 --> 39:32.268
And now it really
is the moment of truth.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.436
Squirt it in there, tick.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.842
I mean it looks like
I'm pumping soda
out of this thing.

39:38.844 --> 39:42.078
I'll be damn if ain't...
Ain't carbonated.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.414
It's got a beautiful
slight peach tint to it.

39:44.416 --> 39:47.150
And it's nice and it's bubbly.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.319
What do you think?

39:51.022 --> 39:53.022
Pretty damn good there.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.392
I'm afraid to try it.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.761
[tickle] give it a try.
See what you think.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.163
Come on, now. What...
What do you think there,
henry?

40:00.165 --> 40:02.332
It's got a good taste to it,
ain't it?

40:04.002 --> 40:06.336
[josh] he spit it out? Oh!

40:08.340 --> 40:10.073
-[henry] you going for real.
-[josh] huh?

40:10.075 --> 40:12.942
-You're going for real.
-[josh] what are you talking
about? You don't like it?

40:12.944 --> 40:15.078
-For real?
-[henry] you don't have
a peach brandy

40:15.080 --> 40:16.279
turn out like this.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.817
Gold man, baby

40:20.819 --> 40:22.085
[all laughing]

40:22.087 --> 40:23.019
I got you, boy.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.888
[laughing]

40:24.890 --> 40:27.524
he scared me. He scared me.

40:27.526 --> 40:31.227
It's gonna be a gold mine,
I'm telling you!

40:31.229 --> 40:34.030
I'm watching him running
around and spitting it out.
And the whole time I'm

40:34.032 --> 40:36.866
sitting here in a state
of panic thinking I'm never
gonna hear the end of it.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.536
You did good. Did good.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.604
I'm just glad that
it worked out and he likes it.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.873
I was scared to death
y'all was gonna trip out
on it.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.643
I was a little terrified
myself, son,
I have to admit.

40:46.645 --> 40:47.911
It's real bubbly.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.413
It's real light.
It'd be something
that a lot of people

40:50.415 --> 40:52.115
could drink that
normally wouldn't drink.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.751
It's almost I could
bubble in champagne
or something.

40:54.753 --> 40:55.785
Cap her on up.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.554
-Here.
-Yeah, baby.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.657
[henry] normally, my customers
for brandy, they look
for that kick.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.993
They look for that 100-105
proof from that brandy.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.729
<i>  In this situation,</i>
<i>  we've taken that flavor</i>
<i>  from that brandy,</i>

41:06.731 --> 41:09.799
<i>  and we've reduced it down</i>
<i>  to 20 proof. We lookin'</i>
<i>  a whole new market.</i>

41:09.801 --> 41:12.168
<i>  We lookin' at customers</i>
<i>  that they love the flavor.</i>

41:12.170 --> 41:14.404
Just enough to give
them a slight buzz.

41:14.406 --> 41:16.372
<i>  Think we could make</i>
<i>  a pile of money with this...</i>

41:16.374 --> 41:17.674
This younger generation.

41:17.676 --> 41:20.743
This about the easiest
juggin' up I've ever done
in my life.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.812
<i>  The tricky part of this</i>
<i>  hard seltzer,</i>

41:22.814 --> 41:24.681
we've never sold
anything like this.

41:24.683 --> 41:25.849
We wanna be competitive

41:25.851 --> 41:28.985
with what people are buying
this stuff in the store for.

41:28.987 --> 41:32.422
But then again, we can't just
give this stuff away either.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.023
[henry] let's finish getting
these bottled up.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.925
'cause this stuff
is gone this afternoon.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.794
-Awesome, perfect.
-It's that good.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.263
-Thank you, bro.
-Thank you.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.874
[josh] we need to
come up with
a name for it.

41:50.876 --> 41:54.077
How about back wood boys
hard seltzer?

41:54.079 --> 41:56.012
[henry] why do we
wanna use "boys"?

41:56.014 --> 41:56.813
[tickle] I ain't a boy.

41:56.815 --> 41:57.680
Back woods men.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.917
I... Some... I don't know.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.753
[tickle] look, till you
come up with a name,
you don't get your cut.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.388
How about polk county
paralyzer?

42:05.390 --> 42:07.957
Polk county...
We ain't in polk county.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.593
That don't matter.
I made the first batch
in polk county.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.028
I don't know. It sue is--

42:12.030 --> 42:13.429
[henry] you like word "peat"
don't you frank?

42:13.431 --> 42:14.797
Twisted peach punch.

42:14.799 --> 42:16.299
-What do you think about that?
-That's pretty good.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.601
Double twisted peach punch.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.904
-Double twisted peach punch.
-That's too much.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.740
I don't know. I like double
better than plain.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.108
They're gonna pay more
for something double twisted

42:25.110 --> 42:27.076
than single twisted.

42:27.078 --> 42:29.012
It's too hard.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.380
Just for you, josh.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.284
Double twisted peach punch.

42:34.286 --> 42:35.852
What do you want again, sir?

42:35.854 --> 42:38.988
I want some homemade
double twisted peach punch.
Hard seltzer.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.391
You got it. Done deal.

42:44.429 --> 42:47.163
[tickle] all right, fellers.
Yeehaw!

42:47.165 --> 42:48.698
Think we ought to keep
a case of that ourselves,
right?

42:48.700 --> 42:51.501
Looks damn, look,
just about like a damn beer.

42:51.503 --> 42:53.770
-Beer tint.
-[tickle] here's the more
important question, fellas.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.039
What you reckon
we oughta sell this stuff for?

42:56.041 --> 42:58.207
I ain't gonna lie if you could
sell for 20 dollars a jar,

42:58.209 --> 42:59.876
that'd be one hell of
a profit.

42:59.878 --> 43:00.743
That ain't bad.

43:00.745 --> 43:01.811
I don't think we'll
get that for it.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.414
-That's too stout. Yeah.
-[tickle] too steep for it?

43:04.416 --> 43:07.650
-It's gotta be
worth our time too.
-$20 is right by it.

43:07.652 --> 43:10.553
[tickle]
oh, sure look. You make a
couple hundred extra dollars

43:10.555 --> 43:12.488
for just a little bit
more work. It's worth it,
ain't it?

43:12.490 --> 43:15.425
That's what I'm trying
to say. What do you reckon?

43:15.427 --> 43:18.895
What are people
willing to pay? We know what
they'll pay for our brandy.

43:18.897 --> 43:20.697
What will they pay
for this stuff?

43:20.699 --> 43:21.931
Here's what it boils down to.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.267
20 dollars is too steep.
10 dollars ain't enough.

43:24.269 --> 43:27.437
They sell this
in the stores, don't they?

43:27.439 --> 43:31.040
They do. But what we got
right here is twice as strong
as what's in the store.

43:31.042 --> 43:32.875
-So what they sell in
the store is like five.
-And twice as much.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.510
And twice as much.

43:34.512 --> 43:37.146
If 5% in stores,
we're throwing
10% out there.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.616
-Yeah.
-So that's gonna pull
some more people in.

43:39.618 --> 43:40.817
Well look. I... I...

43:40.819 --> 43:42.952
What do you all
think about this?

43:42.954 --> 43:45.421
One quart of liquor
will make five quarts of this.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.156
Yeah.

43:47.158 --> 43:48.891
If we take
and make this stuff

43:48.893 --> 43:50.927
12 dollars a quart,

43:50.929 --> 43:53.830
and then get rid of
all five quarts

43:53.832 --> 43:54.530
that one quart will make,

43:54.532 --> 43:56.799
that's 60 bucks.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.769
[henry] then we turn that
160 dollars gallon of
peach brandy into

43:59.771 --> 44:00.870
240 dollars.

44:00.872 --> 44:03.640
240 dollars a gallon.

44:03.642 --> 44:06.042
160 dollar gallon
of shine into 240.

44:06.044 --> 44:07.443
-240.
-I like the sound of that.

44:07.445 --> 44:08.911
That don't sound bad.

44:08.913 --> 44:09.779
That's good money
right there.

44:09.781 --> 44:12.015
<i>  And also we broaden</i>

44:12.017 --> 44:14.617
the market to a whole 'nother
group of people.

44:14.619 --> 44:15.618
A whole quart for $12,
who wouldn't--

44:15.620 --> 44:17.920
-who can't afford that?
-I mean, think about it.

44:17.922 --> 44:21.424
[tickle] and once they buy
their first one, they coming
back for another one.

44:21.426 --> 44:24.060
Good as that is,
and as strong as it is,

44:24.062 --> 44:25.795
I don't see no problems
selling it.

44:25.797 --> 44:27.463
Sounds like
we got a plan then.

44:27.465 --> 44:29.599
[tickle] I say we go
make this a damn sale.

44:29.601 --> 44:31.834
[henry] how we gonna sell half
a case is all I know.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.303
Y'all gonna drink it
all up before we can
get there with it.

44:50.021 --> 44:53.156
[digger]that's alcohol baking.
That's the head coming off.

44:53.158 --> 44:56.659
-Okay.
-Well, we've got enough out
of it, I'd say, don't we?

44:56.661 --> 44:58.227
[beaz] yepper.

44:58.229 --> 45:01.030
All right mark. What color you
think this run's gonna be?

45:01.032 --> 45:03.332
Oh, it's gonna
be clear, beaz.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.903
[beaz] hot metal
looks like cold metal.

45:06.905 --> 45:10.406
[digger] and hot air
is invisible just like
cold air.

45:10.408 --> 45:11.374
[beaz] yeah.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.445
[digger] all right,
there it comes.

45:15.747 --> 45:18.948
Yup. Scuppernong.

45:18.950 --> 45:21.751
-[beaz] it's clear.
-Yes, it's not blue,
mr. Beazy.

45:21.753 --> 45:22.919
[beaz] well...

45:22.921 --> 45:24.787
[mark] if it had been
blue this time

45:24.789 --> 45:27.824
we'd have had a problem,
houston.

45:27.826 --> 45:31.094
Can you believe
how strong the scuppernong
smell is?

45:33.932 --> 45:36.132
Oh, my!

45:36.801 --> 45:38.201
Man, it's double distilled,
but, man, it's still

45:38.203 --> 45:41.370
plenty flavorful with
the scuppernong.

45:41.506 --> 45:42.772
And it ain't blue.

45:43.274 --> 45:45.408
-[beaz] and it's not
blue, I'll be danged.
-It ain't blue.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.376
You know it's... It's crazy
how good this

45:47.378 --> 45:51.214
second distillation of this
scuppernong cognac tastes.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.716
<i>  You know, I think</i>
<i>  that we've hit it out of</i>
<i>  the park.</i>

45:53.718 --> 45:55.618
It's just a matter now
of getting it barrel aged.

45:55.620 --> 45:56.886
That's hard liquor
right there.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.422
[digger] exactly how you want
it to be. That's... That's

45:59.424 --> 46:00.656
the queen of
the liquor right there.

46:00.658 --> 46:02.792
Damn.

46:02.794 --> 46:05.027
<i> [digger] this scuppernong</i>
<i>  flavor, it's right there</i>
<i>  in the front.</i>

46:05.029 --> 46:07.130
It mellows out
then it finishes off

46:07.132 --> 46:09.132
real good with them
floral notes

46:09.134 --> 46:10.867
<i>  that you get from a grape.</i>

46:10.869 --> 46:12.068
Oh, richard.

46:12.237 --> 46:13.770
What's up, cool breeze?

46:13.772 --> 46:16.873
<i> [richard on phone] I just</i>
<i>  came up on a whole bunch</i>
<i>  of cherries, man.</i>

46:16.875 --> 46:18.674
<i>  I'm trying to find something</i>
<i>  to do with it.</i>

46:18.676 --> 46:21.611
<i>  Thought I'd make</i>
<i>  my signature cherry bounce.</i>

46:21.613 --> 46:24.847
We first met
richard landry with
<i>  master distiller.</i>

46:24.849 --> 46:27.917
Here we go, fellas.
This gonna be richard.

46:27.919 --> 46:29.552
[mark] that's richard.
Oh, my.

46:29.554 --> 46:30.920
Richard?

46:30.922 --> 46:32.855
You're the next
master distiller, my friend.

46:32.857 --> 46:34.423
Congratulations, bro.

46:34.425 --> 46:36.592
<i> [mark] richard is impressive</i>
<i>  as a distiller.</i>

46:36.594 --> 46:38.294
But he's also a donkey
on the edge.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.630
He don't mind
trying new things.

46:40.632 --> 46:44.433
<i>  He says he has access</i>
<i>  to a lot of cherries</i>
<i>  where he's at.</i>

46:44.435 --> 46:46.035
<i> [richard] I got a couple</i>
<i>  hundred pounds of it.</i>

46:46.037 --> 46:48.805
Damn. That's a million
dollars' worth of cherries.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.373
Hey, richard.
We're right now

46:51.075 --> 46:52.909
finishing up a run of

46:52.911 --> 46:54.610
scuppernong cognac.

46:54.612 --> 46:57.013
Why wouldn't that
work with cherries?

46:57.015 --> 46:59.749
<i> [richard] well, it definitely</i>
<i>  would work with cherries.</i>
<i>  I don't know</i>

46:59.751 --> 47:01.684
<i>  what kind of process</i>
<i>  y'all doing with that?</i>

47:01.686 --> 47:03.686
We just run it twice. Do a

47:03.688 --> 47:05.855
stripping run, a spirit run.

47:05.857 --> 47:07.557
[richard] well,
that sounds good right there.

47:07.559 --> 47:09.492
You use that cane syrup.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.561
Do you think you could get
some of that?

47:11.563 --> 47:13.396
<i> [richard] I got so much</i>
<i>  sugar cane around me</i>

47:13.398 --> 47:15.531
<i>  I can't throw a rock</i>
<i>  without hitting some.</i>

47:15.533 --> 47:20.436
Uh, how about me and
old digger officially inviting
you to tennessee

47:20.438 --> 47:22.805
to come up here
and bring those stuff and...
And we'll...

47:22.807 --> 47:25.675
We'll do this run
with you and we can all
learn something.

47:25.677 --> 47:27.677
You can hang out with us
a while.

47:27.679 --> 47:31.948
<i> [richard] man, that's</i>
<i> a christmas present right now.</i>
<i>  I'm on my way.</i>

47:31.950 --> 47:35.451
That sounds good, boss.
We'll look... We'll look
forward to seeing you

47:35.453 --> 47:37.954
and I'm anxious to
lean about the cane.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.789
<i> [richard] I'll give you all</i>
<i>  a call when I get</i>
<i>  everything together.</i>

47:39.791 --> 47:42.425
Sound like a plan, buddy.
I look forward to it.

47:42.427 --> 47:44.727
<i> -[richard] all right,</i>
<i>  thank you.</i>
<i> -See you, bye.</i>

47:44.729 --> 47:47.897
Well, you know, richard's
wanting to do a cherry liquor.

47:47.899 --> 47:51.767
He wants to take it
to the next level.
So here we go.

47:51.769 --> 47:54.270
[beaz] yeah,
this is heavy. Good lord!

47:54.272 --> 47:55.371
[digger] I got these rags.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.974
[all laughing]
