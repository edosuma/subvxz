00:10.885 --> 00:11.886
Hey, babe.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.764
I thought you were supposed
to be home like an hour ago.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.057
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.226
I was disking up the field,

00:18.309 --> 00:21.146
and the steering wheel
just snapped off the tractor.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.606
I had to finish it up
and steer it with a wrench.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.737
Long story short, we got a bunch
of fence we gotta replace.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.613
Oh, did we have a cat?

00:31.322 --> 00:32.866
What? No.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.242
All right, good, we still don't.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.415
What are you doin'?

00:40.498 --> 00:44.127
I'm just making a list of all the things
we need to do before the baby comes.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.754
-Ah!
-Mm-hm.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.381
[sniggering] It's color-coded.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.718
-With flow charts?
-Yep.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.221
All right, but just add to the list,
"Stop being so anal."

00:58.308 --> 01:01.061
But right underneath,
"Keep being so pretty."

01:02.687 --> 01:05.231
I'll just file both of those
under "Find a new husband."

01:05.315 --> 01:06.149
Oh!

01:11.029 --> 01:14.157
Oh my God. The baby's gonna be here
in a month and we have so much to do.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.993
I still have to write thank-you notes
for my baby shower,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.079
you have to build furniture
for the nursery,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.164
and I still have to learn
how to play the piano,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.374
so we can teach
the baby how to play piano.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.418
Piano?

01:26.127 --> 01:28.254
We havin' a baby or we havin' a nerd?

01:30.298 --> 01:32.967
Look, I'll get the baby furniture built,

01:33.051 --> 01:35.136
right after I fix the tractor,

01:35.220 --> 01:36.429
finish framin' up the house,

01:36.513 --> 01:39.265
get the whole herd to market, by <i>myself.</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:42.727
Is cocaine still a thing?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.524
How are we gonna do all this?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.025
I'm tellin' you.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
No!

01:52.862 --> 01:53.738
No.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
I'll tick one thing off your list.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.537
Tile.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.540
On the way back from the feed store
I stopped by

02:03.623 --> 02:05.542
and got some samples for the kitchen.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.627
Oh... Woah... Oo.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.258
They're... all white.

02:13.591 --> 02:14.592
Are they?

02:15.468 --> 02:17.554
Or is this one... off-white?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.306
This one [in silly accent] alabaster.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.351
This one's bone.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.521
It's not as cool as you think. I already
asked, it's not made outta real bone.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.357
I guess I thought we would go with

02:29.440 --> 02:31.693
something a little bit more colorful.
I don't know.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.695
Okay, well, what about...

02:35.155 --> 02:36.406
[Colombian accent] cocaine?

02:46.374 --> 02:49.836
I'll stop by
and get some more samples tomorrow.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.173
No, it's fine. It's fine. I'll just...

02:53.256 --> 02:54.883
I'll squeeze it in after the doctor

02:54.966 --> 02:57.969
and before I pick up the flashcards
to teach the baby Mandarin.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.557
Oh my God, our little girl's
gonna get teased like crazy. Damn.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.184
Yeah, by me.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.145
I'm gonna give her lunch money
and just take it away from her.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.771
-[loud bang]
-[dog barking]

03:08.897 --> 03:10.231
What the hell?

03:12.650 --> 03:13.943
-[Colt] Beau!
-[Abby] Hey!

03:15.236 --> 03:16.738
-[Abby] Oh, my God!
-Shit!

03:17.572 --> 03:18.865
-[Colt] All right.
-Stay back.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.116
Go get the fire extinguisher.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.327
I got it!

03:31.002 --> 03:32.378

truck went before you did.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.039
That was a coin flip.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.043
The engine is shot.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.090
I s'pose the saving grace
is that Joanne's not here to remind me

04:59.173 --> 05:02.343
that "Ford" stands for
"fix or repair daily."

05:04.637 --> 05:06.306
How much is a new engine?

05:06.889 --> 05:10.935
Probably get a mechanic
to toss one in for two grand.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.645
Shit.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.813
I'm sorry.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.526
Well, if you want,
you could borrow my Subaru.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.487
I'd rather push this
anywhere I need to go.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.241
Christ.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.077
I'm already behind in the cullin',

05:28.161 --> 05:30.621
haven't finish the goddamn vaccinations.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.541
Now I gotta fix this piece of shit.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.919
I don't know how
I'm gonna make it to market.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.590
How long can you keep this up?

05:41.799 --> 05:42.800
Whaddya mean?

05:42.884 --> 05:46.054
Well, your father worked himself
to death.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.765
You're only a few months out
from a heart attack.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.808
Now with Rooster gone,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.435
you run this ranch on your own.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.104
Well, with the help of your ex-wife
and a current girlfriend.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.940
God, if someone took a picture
of us working here

05:58.024 --> 06:02.403
it'd be like what they show old people
and say, "See? You can still do stuff."

06:04.113 --> 06:05.615
Whaddya want me to say, Maggie?

06:06.574 --> 06:07.658
Am I tired?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.660
Hell, yes, I'm tired.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.038
Half the time I don't feel
like doin' anything.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.874
They oughta make me an honorary Democrat.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.755
Do you even like ranching anymore?

06:20.838 --> 06:24.801
I like it less than Reagan
and more than Canadian bacon.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.306
You don't get to rename American ham
and call it your fuckin' own.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.810
Have to admit...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.522
I been thinkin' a lot lately about...

06:38.606 --> 06:40.441
what life would be like if I...

06:40.525 --> 06:42.068
slowed down a little bit.

06:45.029 --> 06:45.863
Well...

06:46.406 --> 06:48.282
maybe it's time to make a change.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.575
Not that easy.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.828
It is if you want it to be, Beau.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.746
What am I supposed to do?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.832
Retire and leave it all to Colt?

06:58.209 --> 07:00.503
He got his hands full
with the Peterson Ranch.

07:01.629 --> 07:05.550
This mornin' I saw him steerin' a tractor
with a fuckin' wrench.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.763
I'll get through it.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.015
I always do.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.191
[vehicle approaching]

07:25.570 --> 07:26.696
Hi.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.655
Hey.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.781
Painting a dresser?

07:29.615 --> 07:32.410
You just asked
a rhetorical question, Colt.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.745
You're coming along nicely.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.123
Really?

07:37.874 --> 07:38.833
Did I?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.379
-Am I still doin' it?
-[chuckles] No.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.674
I was comin' outta the doctor's office
and I saw this

07:46.757 --> 07:49.010
in the alley behind the furniture store
on Walnut.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.471
I think I might have stolen this.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.515
I see.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.019
Did you unload this thing by yourself?

07:58.102 --> 07:59.687
That's not a rhetorical question.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.732
Or was it? I don't fuckin' know.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.152
Yeah, and then I just
dragged it over here.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.239
Babe, come on, there's rules
for pregnant ladies.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.410
You can't move furniture,
and you can't ride Dumbo at Disneyland.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
Not that I'd know,
'cause my dad never took me.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.293
He used to spray us down with the hose
and be like, "There's Splash Mountain."

08:24.003 --> 08:26.631
It's not a big deal.
We needed a dresser, so I got one.

08:26.714 --> 08:30.968
Maybe illegally, but with a fresh coat
of paint, who's gonna fuckin' know?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.097
I told you I was gonna build the dresser.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.808
I'm just tryin' to check things
off the list.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.101
I don't want you doin' 'em.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.395
Why? 'Cause you have
this old-fashioned notion

08:41.479 --> 08:43.189
that pregnant women can't do anything?

08:43.272 --> 08:46.359
Yeah, we won't have any baby furniture.
The baby can sleep in a laundry basket.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.735
Oh, okay.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.071
Right, so I'm the bad guy

08:50.154 --> 08:53.783
because I don't want my pregnant wife
moving furniture, is that it?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.410
And by the way,
for the first five years of my life

08:56.494 --> 08:58.621
my car seat was a laundry basket.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.623
And I'm fine.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.416
You know we're having a baby in a month?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.877
Yeah, I <i>know.</i>

09:05.419 --> 09:08.256
By the way, I'm running
our Facebook pregnancy page.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.678
And if you could "like" it,
that'd be great.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.599
All right, look. Look.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.144
I know we got a lot to do.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.939
Don't worry. I'm on it.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.357
Really?

09:26.440 --> 09:29.735
The night I told you I was pregnant,
you told me you were gonna build a crib

09:29.819 --> 09:32.029
and all the baby furniture,
and here we are,

09:32.113 --> 09:36.325
eight months later and the list keeps
getting longer and nothing's gettin' done.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.036
-Nothing's gettin' done?
-No.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.791
Okay, I'm sorry. I just...
I've been a little bit busy.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.919
I'm out buildin' a house.
And runnin' a ranch.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.879
I gotta get cattle to market,

09:48.963 --> 09:51.215
and don't even ask me what happened
in the last four <i>NCISs</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:53.259
'cause I got no fuckin' idea.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.636
Oh, I'm sorry you're missing
all your TV shows.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.513
I am growing a person.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.517
Sorry, I'm doin' everything I can.

10:01.601 --> 10:05.146
On top of everything else, yesterday
I drove all the way to Grand Junction

10:05.229 --> 10:07.440
to pick up a car seat that <i>you</i> wanted.

10:07.523 --> 10:12.111
And oh, by the way, the only parking spots
they had were for expecting mothers.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.904
I didn't know if I could park there.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.574
I did. You can't.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.869
So, now I've got a dent
in the side of my Bronco.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.039
And I don't even think that woman
was pregnant. I think she's just fat.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.002
Why would you pick up a car seat?
We don't need that for a month.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.670
It was on the list.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.881
It was green.
"Green" means we can wait on it.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.341
That don't even make any sense.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.509
Green don't mean "wait." Green means "go."

10:37.136 --> 10:40.222
You told me to pick up a car seat
so I picked up a car seat.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.143
Now you gonna yell at me because I picked
up a car seat and I'm not building a crib?

10:44.226 --> 10:46.062
I can't even... I can't fuckin' win.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.564
It's not about winning or losing, okay?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.775
It's about gettin' this shit done.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.694
We're havin' a baby
whether we're ready or not, okay?

10:54.737 --> 10:58.240
Colt, this is not like that trip to Denver
when I had that Big Gulp, okay?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.868
I can't just cross my legs
and hope it goes away.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.036
You know what?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.622
I'll get it done, okay?

11:04.705 --> 11:06.624
I'll build the crib tonight!

11:06.707 --> 11:08.459
I don't care what color code it is.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.419
It's red 'cause it's important.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.255
"Red" means stop!

11:21.722 --> 11:23.015
All right.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.392
That should fix it.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.312
I'm gonna test one out just to make sure.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.108
[country music playing]

11:37.238 --> 11:38.364
It's still warm.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.451
Try another one in five minutes.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.162
I know you're slammed.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.331
Thanks for taking the time,
coming over here.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.292
How's Abby feeling?

11:50.668 --> 11:51.544
[laughs]

11:54.630 --> 11:56.006
She's...

11:56.173 --> 11:58.217
pretty much constantly pissed at me.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.552
But...

11:59.635 --> 12:02.179
she's got this laundry list

12:02.471 --> 12:05.141
of things we've gotta get done
before the baby comes.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.642
It's like a mile long.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.855
I'm working from sunup to sundown,

12:10.938 --> 12:14.525
and I get home and the only thing we do
is fight about what I haven't gotten done.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.695
Mom, I'm getting paint chips,

12:17.778 --> 12:19.572
I'm going to birthing class.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.324
She made me go out and buy
these things called "nipple shields."

12:25.870 --> 12:29.915
I mean, that literally stands
against everything I believe in in life.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.631
So, the way I'm hearing this is

12:37.715 --> 12:40.259
she's doing everything wrong
and you're doing everything right?

12:41.427 --> 12:42.970
See? You get it.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.059
Y'know, Colt, you got a choice.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.936
You can be right or you can be happy.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.981
'Cause none of this little shit matters.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.736
The only thing that baby really needs
is parents who love each other.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.949
I think we're both just overwhelmed.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.410
I can't wait for this baby to be born

13:06.494 --> 13:08.412
so everything just calms down.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.713
Yeah, 'cause that's how it works
with kids.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.844
Y'know, when I was pregnant with Rooster

13:24.428 --> 13:27.389
your father surprised me
with a weekend at Copper Mountain.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.017
We didn't ski.
I couldn't 'cause of the baby

13:30.100 --> 13:33.771
and he didn't ski because he thought
it was too European.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.278
But we just rode the ski lifts,
y'know, and...

13:42.029 --> 13:44.240
drank hot cocoa, sat by the fire.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.743
And it reminded us why we wanted
to have kids together in the first place.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.957
And then he said he didn't like the sound
of ski pants rubbing together

13:53.040 --> 13:54.208
so we had to go, but...

13:58.254 --> 13:59.088
Yeah.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.008
Every time I wear corduroys around
the house, I gotta walk around

14:03.092 --> 14:04.218
with my legs like...

14:09.014 --> 14:11.600
I wish I could do something like that.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.018
We just don't have the time.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.688
Well, if you're worried about the ranch,

14:15.771 --> 14:17.022
I could cover for you.

14:17.606 --> 14:21.193
Y'know, this may be your last chance
to have fun together as a couple

14:21.277 --> 14:23.237
for, like, the next 18 years.

14:27.658 --> 14:32.079
I thought having kids was supposed to be,
like, the most magical time of your life.

14:32.162 --> 14:35.457
Oh, please, that's just some bullshit
parents with kids<i> </i>tell you

14:35.541 --> 14:38.419
so that you'll be as miserable
as they are.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.924
-Hey, Maria.
-Hey, Mary.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.176
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.679
My grandson
ate too many powdered doughnuts.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.517
I don't know what hell is like
but it cannot be worse than cleaning vomit

14:53.601 --> 14:56.312
out of the center console
of a Ford Taurus.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.231
No, it could be worse.

15:00.024 --> 15:04.153
They could be 34 and throw up
Jägermeister on your new Subaru.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.201
I said I was sorry.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.083
Y'know, Mary, I've been looking over
these books and it just doesn't add up.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.629
I mean, I don't know if the inventory
is off or we're missing receipts,

15:21.712 --> 15:25.341
but we're short like $50 a day.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.927
Well, shit, I'm sorry.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.638
I thought I was doing the books right.
Maybe I screwed something up.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.723
All right, let me take a look.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.904
Okay, you got er... 89, 99...

15:47.863 --> 15:49.198
ten-dee-nine.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.411
Yeah, it checks out. That's $50 a day.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.122
Let me look at it. I'll figure it out.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.415
I don't mind, I'll do it.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.126
No, I got it. You got too much
on your mind, anyway.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.837
If we're still short, I'll start
adding more water to the whiskey.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.048
No, Mary, don't do that.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.925
People can tell the difference.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.427
[together] You gotta add it to the vodka.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.575
That's why we practice.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.289
You're gonna be a great father, Colt.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.584
Is your dad around?

16:42.668 --> 16:43.836
I think he's inside.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.588
But, hey, before you talk to him,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.549
I had a little favor I wanted to ask you.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.385
God, I wish your dad
would pick up his cell phone.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.929
I know, right?

16:54.555 --> 16:55.931
I'm sorry, I...

16:56.015 --> 16:58.684
I know you got connections
with the Broncos.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.227
So, I was...

17:01.311 --> 17:05.524
<i>hopin'</i> that maybe you could get me a deal
on a couple tickets for my wife and I.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.692
My pregnant wife.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.569
You wanna see the sonogram?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.779
We was thinkin' about namin' her "Lisa."

17:11.613 --> 17:13.866
Y'know... like... your name?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.200
Yeah, I got it.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.244
Okay, how about this?

17:17.453 --> 17:21.874
Neumann still has a suite. I'm sure
I can get you a couple extra tickets.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.084
That's amazing.
But I insist you let me pay.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.086
They're $1,100 apiece.

17:27.963 --> 17:28.797
Oh!

17:29.298 --> 17:30.132
Er...

17:30.674 --> 17:32.551
Well... y'know... eh...

17:33.177 --> 17:36.930
I wouldn't wanna offend you
by spoiling your generosity with money.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.558
Just come by the office tomorrow,
you can pick up your tickets.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.934
Yeah, cool.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.771
-Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Beau.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.980
Thought that was you.

17:45.064 --> 17:45.939
Yeah.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.860
I stopped by to let you know that my vets
are gonna be doing immunizations tomorrow,

17:49.943 --> 17:52.279
so, if you see some new faces,
they're my guys.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.282
You can shoot 'em but don't shoot to kill.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.785
All right,
I'll just make 'em dance a little.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.873
While I got you here,
I need to ask you for a favor.

18:02.956 --> 18:06.293
What? Dad, come on!

18:06.376 --> 18:09.213
She's done more than enough
for this family already.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.758
Come sit.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.932
So, what can I do for you?

18:20.015 --> 18:24.061
Well, I hate to ask, but my truck
is outta commission for a bit.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.314
Any chance I could rent one of yours

18:27.397 --> 18:29.775
until mine is up and runnin' again?

18:29.858 --> 18:31.318
Are you kidding?

18:31.401 --> 18:34.279
If I could take a picture
of Beau Bennett, in a truck

18:34.363 --> 18:37.282
with a Neumann's Hill logo on it,
I'd pay <i>you</i> to use it.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.244
I'd rather drive my ex-wife's Subaru.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.746
All right, it's not a problem.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.708
Look, I know that with Colt
working over at the Peterson ranch

18:46.792 --> 18:48.544
you're stretched a little thin.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.171
Is there anything else
I can do to help you?

18:51.255 --> 18:54.800
Sure, you can send your men
and trucks over,

18:54.883 --> 18:58.554
load up my cows, haul 'em to market,
bring me back a check...

18:59.346 --> 19:03.308
while I sit here and pop the cork
on a bottle of "peanut newer."

19:06.395 --> 19:07.354
I can do that.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.522
That was a joke.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.608
You can tell
because I was drinking wine in it.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.237
I'm serious.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.866
You took in my herd
without asking anything in return.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.619
And besides, it's not much extra work.
My cows are all here anyway.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.038
I appreciate the offer, Lisa.

19:25.122 --> 19:29.001
There's no trick here, Beau. I am happy
to guarantee today's market price.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.253
I'll even throw in a bottle of

19:31.336 --> 19:33.046
peanut newer.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.925
I appreciate the offer, Lisa.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.093
You just said that.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.344
I know.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.932
I'm trying to avoid telling you
to get the fuck off my property.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.602
If you'd pick up your fuckin' phone,

19:46.685 --> 19:48.854
I wouldn't have to be here
in the first place.

19:54.818 --> 19:55.819
All right.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.031
Can't let Drake near the baby.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.703
Abby said the same thing about you.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.834
I had an interesting conversation
with Lisa Neumann.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.089
-Yeah?
-She wants to buy all our cows, right now.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.301
And do all the work to get them to market.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.012
[chuckling] After that offer,
I bet she looked like my doll.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.475
It's actually a pretty good deal.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.852
She's guaranteeing market price.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.229
[scoffs] Yeah.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.731
Market price today.
But when the market goes up,

20:32.814 --> 20:34.316
she gets all the extra money.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.236
-And if it goes down, she takes the hit.
-Yeah.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.279
I know how the market works, Dad.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.702
Just got back from Mom's bar,
helping her balance all her books.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.582
I think you should take it.

20:53.001 --> 20:53.877
Why?

20:55.212 --> 20:58.340
You got a baby on the way,
trying to rebuild your house.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.343
Be one less thing on your plate.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.263
Are you takin'?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.765
This isn't about what I'm doin'.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.434
That's a "no."

21:10.560 --> 21:12.062
But you think I should.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.564
What, because...

21:15.274 --> 21:16.984
you're a better rancher than me?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.069
That's not what I'm sayin'.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.154
You are a good rancher.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.657
I just think this'll help you out.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.744
This is unbelievable.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.330
You give me a ranch...

21:31.623 --> 21:33.542
and after <i>all</i> the work I've done...

21:35.002 --> 21:36.378
you still don't believe in me.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.768
-Hey, Mary.
-Oh, hey. Want a beer?

21:51.852 --> 21:53.937
I'd join you, but my boss just walked in.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.983
Nah, I'm good.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.027
I'm sorry I stranded you all day.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.237
I helped Colt frame the living room,

22:02.321 --> 22:04.281
helped Beau with his immunizations,

22:04.364 --> 22:06.950
and then had to talk Abby off the ledge

22:07.034 --> 22:10.162
after they showed her some videos
in her birthing class.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.668
After that I don't think she's going
for the whole drug-free delivery thing.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.255
You should tell Abby if she needs
any extra toys, I got tons.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.633
The secret is, you go for the ones
that have been recalled.

22:25.218 --> 22:29.514
One dumb kid chokes on a plane propeller
and boom, Christmas is covered.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.559
Colt was one of those kids.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.937
Didn't help that Rooster convinced him
to eat all the parts of <i>Operation</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:37.689
so they could do it for real.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.905
Listen, I'm glad you're here.
I figured out why the books are off.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.782
Wow, that was fast.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.618
Hey, I got really high last night.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.621
When I woke up this morning
my remote was in the microwave.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.955
Can you figure that one out?

22:56.666 --> 22:57.667
You like popcorn?

22:59.753 --> 23:00.754
Holy shit!

23:02.839 --> 23:05.842
-So, was it inventory or...?
-No.

23:05.926 --> 23:09.596
I got back from lunch and I noticed there
was money missing from the register.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.181
Maria was the only one here,

23:11.264 --> 23:12.432
so I asked her and...

23:12.974 --> 23:14.684
she got real defensive and then...

23:15.310 --> 23:17.062
we got into it and she quit.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.773
Maria? Are you sure?

23:20.190 --> 23:22.943
No. I mean, I know, I was shocked, too.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.111
But I...

23:24.194 --> 23:27.155
I mean, I guess you never really know
about people, y'know?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.907
I used to have this little old lady

23:28.990 --> 23:30.992
who lived next to me, Dorothy Granville.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.746
She was always working in her garden
and giving everybody vegetables.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.958
Well, it turns out she was hiding
her husband's body in that garden.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.504
God, gorgeous tomatoes, though.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.883
Just can't believe it's Maria.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.345
I know. And I'm sorry
I didn't catch it before, I just...

23:51.138 --> 23:54.391
Well, that's all right.
I mean, everybody misses stuff.

23:54.975 --> 23:58.562
Once, I wasn't paying attention
and I locked a customer inside the bar.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.814
Best night of my life.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.445
Okay, all right, don't worry. We are not
gonna be short-handed, all right?

24:06.528 --> 24:08.321
I'll get Heather and Darlene to help out.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.991
I mean, Heather can use the money
for school and Darlene...

24:11.533 --> 24:14.161
It'd just be nice to give her a job
where she's not paid in singles.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.915
Well, thanks for dealing with everything.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.459
Come on, don't thank me.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.087
It's the least I can do. You trusted me
to run this place and I let you down.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.675
I don't have to tell you this, but ever
since Rooster, it's just been really hard.

24:30.010 --> 24:33.430
Well, I don't know if you're interested
in this sort of thing,

24:33.513 --> 24:38.268
but I joined a grief support group
last week and it's really helping.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.230
Hmm, honestly, if I'm gonna sit around
in a circle with a bunch of people

24:42.314 --> 24:43.982
they better be passing a joint.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.403
We did that afterwards in the parking lot,

24:48.487 --> 24:53.325
but people coming out of the AA meeting
next door, they did not like it.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.417
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.919
I got the nails you wanted.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.003
Oh, thank you.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.297
How'd you go through the first ones
so fast?

25:07.923 --> 25:10.884
I saw a spider,
unloaded the nail gun on it.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.178
-Did you get it?
-No.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.514
But that first stair
ain't ever gonna move.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.058
-[chuckles]
-Hey... I wanted to show you something.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.977
Ta-da!

25:21.895 --> 25:24.898
-Is it under that pile of wood?
-No, it's the crib.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.526
I got plans
and I cut it and I measured it--

25:27.609 --> 25:29.194
Oh shit, spider!

25:29.861 --> 25:32.405
-[nail gun whirs]
-Back up. Back it up.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.165
Thanks, babe.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.587
Hey...er...

25:50.298 --> 25:52.050
Sorry I didn't get the crib built.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.844
Sorry I got so defensive earlier.

25:55.845 --> 25:56.805
It's...

25:58.515 --> 26:00.934
I hate it when I feel like
I'm not takin' care of you.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.186
Oh. What?!

26:03.270 --> 26:06.690
You never make me feel like that.
You always take care of me.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.193
Listen, I am sorry for putting
added pressure on you.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.279
I know you're bustin' your ass.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.198
Just wish I could do more.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.326
I wish I was the one who was pregnant.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.411
[she chuckles]

26:20.036 --> 26:22.831
That's sweet, but frankly,
you couldn't handle it.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.832
What?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.126
I totally could.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.586
Colt, come on.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.463
Last week you ate too many hot wings,
you were rolling on the floor,

26:30.547 --> 26:32.591
and you got me to Google
how to make a will.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.344
Those were three out of five peppers
on the chili meter.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.848
Three out of ten, okay?
The next level up was mild.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.058
I just...

26:42.684 --> 26:44.728
I don't know, with everythin' goin' on...

26:45.729 --> 26:47.105
all the stress...

26:47.981 --> 26:49.983
I don't want us to lose sight
of what's important.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.484
All this baby needs...

26:52.360 --> 26:54.779
is two parents that love each other.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.449
Oh! That's very insightful.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.201
When did you talk to your mom?

27:01.661 --> 27:04.956
When I told her all this baby needs
is two parents who love each other.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.375
No, hey, hold on. Check this out.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.132
[she chuckles]

27:14.257 --> 27:16.384
Y'know, we never had a honeymoon,

27:16.468 --> 27:17.802
so I was thinking--

27:17.886 --> 27:21.681
Are these Bronco tickets
for the season opener?

27:21.765 --> 27:25.060
No, these ain't just tickets, babe,
that's the luxury box!

27:25.143 --> 27:27.020
-Oh my God! I can't believe it!
-What?

27:27.103 --> 27:28.730
This is amazing.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.858
What...? I can't...
Wait a second, are these Photoshopped?

27:31.941 --> 27:32.817
No.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.362
'Cause the last time you did that,
okay, security caught us

27:35.445 --> 27:37.947
and then we ended up
watching the game at Best Buy.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.533
Nope.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.202
They're real.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.873
You know all them times
we watched them rich assholes up there,

27:46.956 --> 27:50.043
swishing their wine, not even watching
the game? That's gonna be us!

27:50.126 --> 27:51.711
Oh, I can't wait!

27:51.795 --> 27:54.297
Did you hear that, sweetie?
Your parents are rich assholes.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.383
-We're rich, yes.
-Assholes. [laughs]

27:58.009 --> 27:59.260
Thank you.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.643
All right, Hank, it's closing time.
Where are your keys?

28:08.269 --> 28:09.896
I'm fuckin' with you. Here they are.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.398
[Hank chuckles]

28:12.857 --> 28:14.317
Hank, you forgot your beer.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.986
Oh, thanks.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.488
Drive safe.

28:18.571 --> 28:22.033
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow,
so I might be a little late.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.203
Okay, I'll cover for you, Hank.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.777
Opening day is the best, full of hope.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.280
Broncos haven't fucked up yet.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.827
I hope Colt and Abby have fun.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.872
I would trade all of Colt's happiness

29:09.664 --> 29:12.000
for the rest of his life
for us to win today.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.172
I'm a little bitter
I didn't get that suite.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.591
-Wait, they're in a suite?
-Yeah.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.675
Fuck them.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.596
Nah, I hope they have a good time.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.807
I mean, they have no idea
what they're in for once this baby comes.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.561
I remember my last week of boot camp.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.938
We only got three hours sleep a night.

29:34.022 --> 29:37.692
It was a cakewalk
compared to life with a newborn.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.695
Yeah, when one of 'em would cry
you'd yell, "At ease!"

29:42.906 --> 29:46.409
Well, they could salute before
they could walk, so no apologies.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.414
I wish Colt would let Lisa Neumann
help him out.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.791
How can she help him?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.835
She offered to write us a check, right now

29:55.919 --> 29:58.046
for whatever cows we wanted to sell

29:58.129 --> 29:59.506
and then get 'em to market.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.801
I thought Colt should take it,
but he won't even consider it.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.638
Y'know, it's a good deal
but he's being completely unreasonable.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.599
Don't open those pretzels
before the kickoff.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.267
You'll jinx the whole season.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.816
[sighs] If it's such a good deal,
why don't you take it?

30:18.274 --> 30:19.400
Why should I take it?

30:21.277 --> 30:24.280
You said you wanted to slow down.
Here's your chance.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.117
In 50 years,
I've never let someone else...

30:29.244 --> 30:30.745
take over my cattle.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.706
Well, you should at least
consider the deal.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.792
First time you saw <i>Blue Bloods,</i>

30:35.875 --> 30:38.795
you said, "What's Magnum PI doing
dressed up as a cop?"

30:38.878 --> 30:42.549
And now, nobody's allowed
to talk to you from 10 to 11 on Fridays.

30:44.801 --> 30:48.596
The day I stop ranchin'
will probably be the day that I die.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.059
Well, you put ranchin'
before being a husband and a father.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.019
You gonna put it before
being a grandfather?

30:55.645 --> 30:59.148
I'd like to put this football game
before this conversation.

31:02.819 --> 31:03.903
Just think about it.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.113
I don't know.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.739
Maybe.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.032
Good enough.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.830
The last thing I'm gonna say is, it's...

31:14.956 --> 31:18.084
a chance to do things different this time.

31:19.335 --> 31:22.088
Besides, it'll be fun
to spoil the shit out of this kid

31:22.171 --> 31:23.965
and then make Colt deal with it.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.052
I'm gonna take the kid to Disneyland

31:28.595 --> 31:30.054
and not invite Colt.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.472
[she chuckles]

31:37.687 --> 31:40.023
-[chuckling] This is amazing!
-Cool!

31:40.607 --> 31:43.401
I mean, the drinks, the food,
there's TVs everywhere.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.321
It's like that time we got all
the free food at Buffalo Wild Wings

31:46.404 --> 31:48.656
'cause I found a cricket
in my ranch dressing.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.118
You didn't want me
to smuggle that little guy in there.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.414
This is amaz--
I already had three beers.

31:56.497 --> 31:59.125
Your mom owns a bar.
You already drink for free.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.044
Yeah, but this is like, this is classier.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.963
I might even have a glass of wine.
They got that peanut newer.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.717
Hey, Colt.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.093
Oh, hey, Lisa.

32:09.719 --> 32:10.887
This is Abby, my wife.

32:10.970 --> 32:14.349
Abby, this is that extremely
generous woman I was telling you about.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.351
You already have the suite, Colt.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.020
I know, but this is amazing.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.647
Y'know, a guy could get used to this.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.565
Don't.

32:23.232 --> 32:25.443
It's very nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.612
This is the best day of my life.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.989
I mean, until you're born, obviously.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.074
And our wedding day.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.533
I said what I said.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.871
Well, y'know, Abby, the best day
of your life is about to get even better.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.332
Wait, is there a chocolate fountain?

32:40.750 --> 32:43.086
Not since the incident with Tony Romo.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.632
But, after the coin toss,
Peyton Manning is gonna come up here.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.676
Shut your fuckin' mouth, Lisa!

32:53.805 --> 32:55.890
I'm sorry.
I'm pregnant, it's the hormones.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.518
Pey... Peyton Manning?

32:59.060 --> 33:01.479
And I'm wearing a stupid
Brock Osweiler jersey?

33:02.021 --> 33:03.982
I'm gonna be like,
"Hey, Peyton, nice to meet you.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.650
That's right, I'm a giant idiot."

33:05.733 --> 33:08.903
Babe, I'm gonna have to pop this off.
You're gonna have to paint an "18" on me.

33:10.029 --> 33:11.864
You know, the waters are free, too.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.201
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.997
-Arrgh!
-[squeaks]

33:19.122 --> 33:21.582
I cannot believe
we're gonna meet Peyton Manning!

33:21.666 --> 33:22.667
I'm not gonna lie to you,

33:22.750 --> 33:25.211
I've thought about this moment
when we've had sex.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.963
Oh, my God, me too.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.717
-This is <i>so</i> great.
-Yeah!

33:30.800 --> 33:32.051
Thank you.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.888
Promise me no matter how hectic things get
we always remember to do stuff like this.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.641
I mean this really...
This is the perfect day.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.935
Hanging out in a suite
with Peyton Manning...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.687
-[both chuckle]
-What about me?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.481
I said what I said.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.277
Um... Colt?

33:49.736 --> 33:52.947
Oh, come on, it's a joke.
It's fine that you're here, too.

33:53.031 --> 33:53.865
No...

33:55.533 --> 33:57.285
My water broke, the baby's coming.

33:59.162 --> 33:59.996
Holy sh--

34:00.079 --> 34:02.457
-Really?
<i>-</i>Yeah. Yeah.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.876
Okay, yeah... We're havin' a baby.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.170
-Yeah.
-We gotta go!

34:08.046 --> 34:11.132
I mean, maybe we could try to wait
until after the coin toss.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.176
-What?
-It's Peyton fuckin' Manning!

34:13.259 --> 34:15.678
I mean, if we time it right
he might be able to deliver it!

34:17.388 --> 34:18.431
I love you.
