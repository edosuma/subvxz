00:01.030 --> 00:01.689
Previously on Nip Tuck...

00:01.700 --> 00:03.292
Fiona McNeil. Publicist.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.426
I have a unique opportunity
that would

00:04.430 --> 00:08.423
fit you guys like
a surgeons glove.

00:08.430 --> 00:10.000
Hearts N Scalpels.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.637
We start production
at episode six

00:13.180 --> 00:15.171
We want producer credits
and the occasional line.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.670
How soon can you start?

00:16.680 --> 00:19.513
Look, its the new cute doctor
from Hearts N Scalpels.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.080
Plastic surgery is
an actors worst nightmare.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.581
Say I was gonna do
that exact same picture.

00:24.590 --> 00:25.739
Would you have to fix anything?

00:25.750 --> 00:28.412
Guess who just got a face-lift.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.799
Carly Summers.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.495
Tell me what you dont like
about yourself, Miss...

00:33.500 --> 00:37.129
Monroe. I had it legally changed
for professional reasons.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.529
Hey, thats pretty good.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.532
I dont usually go for the
plus-sized gals,

00:40.540 --> 00:41.734
but I always had a thing
for Marilyn.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.469
What do you do, parties,
theme parks?

00:43.470 --> 00:44.698
The Walk of Fame.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.530
I stand outside Graumans
Chinese Theater

00:46.540 --> 00:47.700
and take pictures with tourists.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.541
Wow, and the theater
pays you for that?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.212
_ No. Im an
Independent contractor.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.642
I work for tips.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.641
I was the highest earner
on the block.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.175
I made more than even
Chewbacca and Superman.

00:58.180 --> 01:01.581
Until she got in the way.
Now, no one wants me.

01:01.590 --> 01:04.525
They only want her.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.157
Sorry.

01:07.790 --> 01:09.462
Late night on the set.

01:09.470 --> 01:13.588
Oh, you were wonderful
in last weeks episode, Doctor.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.739
Such dramatic intensity.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.197
I would love to be on that show.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.499
So, you were talking about some
woman that you worked with.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.671
-Sharon.
-Whos Sharon do?

01:23.680 --> 01:26.843
Anyone she can get her
slutty little hands on.

01:26.850 --> 01:30.217
She does Marilyn, too.
It used to be okay.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.485
She would do noon to 6:00,
and I would do 6:00 to midnight.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.219
We were friends.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.414
What happened?

01:36.420 --> 01:38.285
First, she started
staying later.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.794
6:30, 7:00, now shes
there all night.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.520
She has no boundaries.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.122
Heres the thing.

01:47.130 --> 01:49.803
Sharons more talented than me,
I own that.

01:49.810 --> 01:53.632
She has a wonderful voice
and she dances like a dream.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.108
But I have more star appeal.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.374
It used to be we each had
a piece of the pie.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.247
But now shes honing in on my
territory and its not fair.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.810
The Walk of Fame has become
a battlefield, Doctors.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.482
I need a bigger set
of torpedoes to give myself

02:07.450 --> 02:08.815
You want breast implants.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.425
The idea being bigger boobies,
bigger tips.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.897
Bingo, baby.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.154
Okay, baby. So look, I dont
mean to be rude, but in your

02:16.160 --> 02:17.559
line of work, are you sure
youre gonna be able

02:17.560 --> 02:18.549
to afford this?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.834
Ive saved up.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.468
Sure, it hurts to crack open
the nest egg,

02:22.470 --> 02:24.301
but what option do I have?

02:24.310 --> 02:27.768
This is my livelihood.

02:27.770 --> 02:30.443
I have an opening
on Thursday morning.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.543
Oh...

02:32.550 --> 02:36.247
Youre wonderful, Dr. Troy.

02:36.250 --> 02:40.186
But I couldnt pass up the
opportunity to work with a star.

02:40.190 --> 02:44.354
I was hoping Dr. McNamara
could do me.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.319
-Id be happy to do you.
-Thank you ever so.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.571
Lets save a life.
Whats the stat, nurse?

03:37.580 --> 03:39.787
Forty-year-old construction
worker, severed right arm...

03:39.790 --> 03:42.350
A severed right arm.
We have a severed right arm!

03:42.350 --> 03:45.581
-One, two, three.
-Vitals, vitals, I need vitals.

03:45.590 --> 03:46.784
I need a tray
of instruments here.

03:46.790 --> 03:50.419
Arm, give me the arm!

03:50.430 --> 03:52.990
I will have this man swimming
the breast stroke in the Nile

03:53.000 --> 03:54.752
by the end of this year,
so help me God.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.899
Nurse, I want
an Esmarch bandage, stat.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.300
That was the last one, Doctor.
Were all out.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.902
How can a hospital be
out of tourniquets?

04:00.910 --> 04:03.470
Nin_e construction workers were
hit by that falling saw blade.

04:03.470 --> 04:04.767
This is not Baghdad.

04:04.770 --> 04:05.737
I mean, severed arms
are not an everyday

04:05.740 --> 04:07.367
occurrence at Seaside General.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.418
Were dealing with severe
arterial hemorrhage, Doctor.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.614
Hes going into shock.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.814
Okay, Peter, go round
up some neckties.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.515
What?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.772
Oh, God damn it,
its casual Friday.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.247
Hes going into shock.
Were gonna lose him.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.945
Thats enough. Thats enough.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.919
Thats enough. Thats enough.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.488
I got you, dont worry.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.718
Its not tight enough, Doctors.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.823
I need it tighter.
I need it tighter!

04:26.830 --> 04:30.459
Well, tighten it. Get a clamp.
Someone get a clamp. Something!

04:30.470 --> 04:35.362
-Give me EKG. EKG!
-The EKG! We need the EKG!

04:35.370 --> 04:36.689
-Cut.
-What?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.668
-Okay, cut!
-Cut.

04:38.670 --> 04:39.773
Cut!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.645
-Come on.
-Whats wrong, darling?

04:41.650 --> 04:43.049
You were perfection.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.473
How come Im the only one
in my goddamned underwear?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.539
The network says
we have to show more skin.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.417
More exposure translates
to higher ratings.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.479
But why cant Kate
take her top off?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.549
Id be like a deer caught
in those headlights.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.448
Okay, Aidan, youre a man tart.
Thats your job.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.052
Im a classically trained
actress.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.664
I know, I know. Julliard,

04:59.670 --> 05:01.319
Royal Shakespeare Company,
blah, blah, blah.

05:01.330 --> 05:03.719
-Yeah, Broadway in the Park.
-Oh, give me a break, Kate.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.061
Okay, the only reason
why you have this job is

05:05.070 --> 05:07.288
youre a hot piece of ass,
everybody knows that.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.995
If she doesnt take her clothes
off, Im not. You know?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.468
-Come on. Im bloated...
-Aidan, please...

05:11.480 --> 05:12.708
Prima donna.

05:12.710 --> 05:16.703
Thats lunch, everyone.
12:12 to 12:42.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.440
Make it safe and walk away.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.423
Excuse me, Kate?

05:29.430 --> 05:30.624
-Yeah?
-You were really good in there.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.598
-Oh.
-Really realistic.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.556
Wow, thank you very much.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.448
I spent a week
with Dr. Sam Nussbaum

05:36.460 --> 05:37.996
over at Cedars. Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.002
You know, if you wanna view
one of our operations

05:40.010 --> 05:42.831
you could scrub in,
see how we do it up close.

05:42.840 --> 05:46.469
Really? Wow. Yeah.
That would be fantastic. When?

05:46.470 --> 05:51.817
-Oh, well, I mean...
-Oh, sorry. Hang on.

05:51.820 --> 05:56.644
Hi, Mom. Youre kidding.
Well, are you sure?

05:56.650 --> 05:57.947
No, no. Sean, Sean, wait, wait.

05:57.950 --> 06:00.020
Hey, Mom, can I call you
right back?

06:00.030 --> 06:01.884
Okay.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.759
What are you doing Sunday?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.352
We dont operate on Sundays.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.669
Yeah, I know this
is last minute,

06:11.670 --> 06:13.661
but my mom just canceled on me.

06:13.670 --> 06:17.128
-Do you happen to have a tux?
-A tux? I could get one.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.940
-Okay. 6:00?
-6:00, yeah, 6:00.

06:20.950 --> 06:25.501
-Okay, Ill... Yeah. Okay.
-Okay. All right.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.504
Its like Im hearing
this song for the first time.

06:52.510 --> 06:54.569
I finally understand what its
about, you know?

06:54.580 --> 06:57.071
Being famous, wanting
a true connection.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.809
I was mobbed at the dry cleaners
this morning.

06:58.810 --> 07:02.985
Yeah, I heard you tell
the receptionist already.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.140
Enjoy your 15 minutes, buddy.
Its gonna be my time soon.

07:05.150 --> 07:08.119
By this afternoon, the phones
are gonna be jammed with people

07:08.120 --> 07:10.998
trying to get an appointment
with these famous fingers.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.560
What happens this afternoon?

07:13.560 --> 07:16.723
The latest issue
of Us magazine hits the shelves.

07:16.730 --> 07:19.631
A little birdie told me
that Carly Summers

07:19.640 --> 07:22.200
face-lift is on the cover,
along with the identity

07:22.210 --> 07:24.098
of a very, very
skilled plastic surgeon.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.967
- You leaked it? How could you?
- Shes a friend of mine.

07:27.970 --> 07:31.576
And I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

07:35.650 --> 07:38.574
I have no idea where
they got that story.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.526
I do. It came from me.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.680
Take a closer look.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.629
"Carly Summers attributes
her youthful new look

07:49.640 --> 07:52.996
"to a daily regimen of juicing
and Bikram Yoga."

07:53.000 --> 07:56.993
Not exactly the story
you were hoping for, is it?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.845
Bold move going to the press
to land yourself some publicity,

08:00.850 --> 08:03.205
but ultimately idiotic, kiddo.

08:03.210 --> 08:06.202
If you had any idea how
the game was really played,

08:06.210 --> 08:10.488
you would know Fiona McNeil
has her hand so far up the ass

08:10.490 --> 08:13.914
of every publisher in this town,
they wouldnt consider taking

08:13.920 --> 08:16.650
a dump without consulting
her first.

08:16.660 --> 08:20.266
And speaking of dumping,
youre out.

08:20.270 --> 08:23.990
Get yourself another publicist.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.926
-Wait, Fiona, I am so...
-Sorry? Corrupt? Save it.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.077
Youre right. Im an asshole.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.277
The towns full of assholes.
What makes you specral?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.601
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.249
You know, I used
to walk down the street

08:44.250 --> 08:47.913
and people would look at me.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.698
Men, women. They all wanted
to be me or be with me.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.657
Now its just...

09:00.070 --> 09:02.868
I dont know who I am anymore.

09:02.870 --> 09:07.034
I still cant figure out,
why leak this story?

09:07.040 --> 09:10.214
Thanks to me, McNamara/Troy
was getting an ample piece

09:10.220 --> 09:12.541
of the plastic surgery pie.

09:12.550 --> 09:14.677
McNamara was getting the piece.

09:17.820 --> 09:22.689
And Troys not content
with his partners crumbs?

09:22.690 --> 09:25.284
No.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.834
Look, Im not proud of this.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.331
Seans like a brother to me.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.559
I was the one who
followed him out here.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.265
Gave up everything I worked for.

09:38.270 --> 09:39.999
Money, prestige, sex.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.039
I had Miami by the balls.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.972
You were also, what?
Twenty-something

09:45.980 --> 09:48.107
when you started?

09:48.110 --> 09:49.611
You shouldve picked
a different venue

09:49.620 --> 09:51.850
to have a midlife crisis in.

09:51.860 --> 09:54.249
Youre never going to be
the new face in town.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.117
Just some forty-something
dying for a comeback.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.022
Youre _the_one who can
give It to me.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.021
Please just give me
another chance.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.123
Ill pay you anything you want.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.772
Oh, goodness. You were
a charming escort, Dr. McNamara.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.304
Well, thank you, darling,
thank you.

10:16.310 --> 10:19.643
Even if you didnt know
who anyone was.

10:19.650 --> 10:22.039
I cant believe Greys Anatomy
won. Are you kidding me?

10:22.050 --> 10:24.314
No, its ratings. Its stupid.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.878
No, I was very impressed

10:25.890 --> 10:27.187
when they called
that other actresss name.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.317
Oh, Mariska Hargitay.
She always wins.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.097
Well, whoever she is,
you handled it with such grace.

10:33.100 --> 10:37.025
Everyone knew it shouldve been
you up there winning that award.

10:37.030 --> 10:41.330
Oh, thats... Thats really
sweet, Sean. Thank you.

10:50.820 --> 10:54.074
I wanted to do that in the limo.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.947
-Is it my consolation prize?
-No, not at all.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.975
Ive been wanting
to do it all night.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.187
I guess Im just a little rusty.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.104
Sean, you should go.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.243
Sean, the limos waiting.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.987
Please, I want you to go.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.852
Are you crying?

11:38.120 --> 11:39.860
Youre not a very good listener,
are you?

11:39.870 --> 11:41.064
Im sorry. I didnt...
I... Ithought...

11:41.070 --> 11:43.163
You thought wrong.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.733
But McNamara/Troy did her
boobies. Chewbacca told me so.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.402
Listen, I could bring you
in a ton of business.

11:52.410 --> 11:57.006
Aquamans been telling me
hes considering pec implants.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.307
Dont take this the wrong way,
sweetheart,

11:58.310 --> 12:01.416
but if the crazies
of the world wanna pay

12:01.420 --> 12:04.742
top dollar to worship
dead movie stars,

12:04.750 --> 12:08.140
maybe theyre better off going
to Madame Tussauds.

12:08.150 --> 12:10.755
You need to get yourself a life,
sweetie pie.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.797
One of your own.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.499
I tried. I wanted
to be an actress.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.435
I just wasnt special enough.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.329
Just another face in the crowd.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.900
Except when it came
to impersonating her.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.969
Shes a goddess, you know?

12:28.970 --> 12:32.770
And even though I know
Im just a copy,

12:32.780 --> 12:35.772
kind of made me feel
like a goddess, too.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.044
You know?

12:38.050 --> 12:40.223
Till she came along.

12:40.230 --> 12:42.824
Joyce.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.025
Shes not as good as me,
you know.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.827
But that doesnt matter here,
now, does it?

12:46.830 --> 12:51.164
Because shes just gonna wow the
crowd with her big new tits and

12:53.940 --> 12:56.465
steal tips that
are rightfully mine.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.305
Do you know what thats like?

13:02.310 --> 13:08.044
To be something special
and to watch someone

13:08.050 --> 13:11.110
who doesnt deserve it

13:11.120 --> 13:13.987
take what belongs to you?

13:14.490 --> 13:16.811
I can pay, Doctor.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.224
Help me stay in the game.

13:22.270 --> 13:23.862
Please.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.246
-Yeah?
-Christian?

13:45.250 --> 13:46.888
Hey, Julia. Whats up?

13:46.890 --> 13:48.380
Oh, is this a bad time?

13:48.390 --> 13:50.119
-I could...
-No, no, no.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.290
Ive got a photo shoot tomorrow.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.892
Im just wondering
smile or no smile.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.118
Wow. A photo shoot.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.826
You two are really
taking LA by storm.

13:57.830 --> 14:01.368
-I caught Sean on the show.
-Yeah, jeez. You see that thing?

14:01.370 --> 14:04.168
-What a piece of...
-I couldnt believe it was him.

14:04.170 --> 14:07.867
He looked so handsome on camera.

14:07.870 --> 14:11.249
Is he around? I was sort of
hoping to catch you both In.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.115
Is there something wrong?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.315
No, no.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.617
I just wanted to know

14:16.620 --> 14:19.077
if you were both gonna
be around next weekend.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.186
I was thinking of coming out,
and Annie has a little break.

14:22.190 --> 14:26.024
So, you know, I thought
it might be fun.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.056
Julia, Ive known you
for 22 years.

14:29.060 --> 14:32.860
You dont just hop on a plane
and cross country on a whim.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.930
Spill it.

14:35.940 --> 14:39.137
Im seeing someone.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.540
And its serious.

14:41.550 --> 14:45.407
- Were moving in together.
- Jesus.

14:45.410 --> 14:49.278
I just didnt wanna surprise him
with it on the phone.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.488
Id rather do it in person.

14:52.490 --> 14:56.256
You dont mind
surprising me, huh?

14:56.260 --> 14:59.889
Well, we will talk about it
when Im there, okay?

15:01.170 --> 15:03.365
I cant wait to see you.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.667
Bye.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.401
So when can I get out of here
and show off my new tits?

15:16.410 --> 15:21.279
Sharons going
to be pea green with envy.

15:21.290 --> 15:24.612
Oh, Im sorry. I thought this
room was gonna be empty.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.440
What is she doing here?

15:26.450 --> 15:30.193
Trying to steal my doctor now,
are you, bitch?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.122
I was the one here first.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.995
Youre moving
in on my turf again.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.925
I wont stay in here with that
imposter. I want my own room.

15:37.930 --> 15:40.535
Well, Im sorry, but this is
the only one thats available.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.135
Then kick her out.
You brought me in here.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.233
You have to take care of me.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.107
Oh, I will.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.340
Did you actually go out,
find that woman,

15:51.350 --> 15:53.318
and bring her here on purpose?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.675
She came to me, her
American Express card worked.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.409
I made us some money.
Whats wrong with that?

15:57.420 --> 15:59.115
You know, you trying
to one-up me all the time

15:59.120 --> 16:01.953
is gonna drive patients away,
not bring them in the door!

16:01.960 --> 16:03.450
I wasnt trying to one-up you.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.121
And you know what? I think this
could be a positive thing.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.324
You know, those girls,
theyre good friends.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.979
Being locked up in a room
together could

16:07.990 --> 16:08.979
help them get back together.

16:08.990 --> 16:10.298
God, this is so like you.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.097
Anytime I get a little taste
of something good,

16:12.100 --> 16:13.089
you cant handle it.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.397
Bullshit. Like when?

16:14.400 --> 16:17.062
Like, oh, I dont know. Julia?

16:17.070 --> 16:19.959
I meet the woman Im gonna marry
and you have to sleep with her

16:19.970 --> 16:22.973
the night before the ceremony.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.709
Ive apologized
a thousand times.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.371
What, do I have to apologize
for the new guy

16:26.380 --> 16:27.642
shes moving in with as well?

16:27.650 --> 16:29.470
-What?
-Nothing.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.984
What do you mean the new guy
shes moving in with?

16:32.990 --> 16:34.309
Julia called the house
yesterday.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.515
She wanted to tell you
personally, but, you know.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.511
She met someone.
Shes moving in with him.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.227
Well, thats great. Shes seeing
someone, Im seeing someone.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.299
Since when are
you seeing someone?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.460
Im having a little fling

16:43.470 --> 16:44.994
with somebody on the show.
An actress.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.399
Theres a bit of
a difference here.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.119
Youre not moving in
with your current piece of ass.

16:49.130 --> 16:50.529
Yet!

17:00.490 --> 17:02.185
Kate.

17:02.190 --> 17:05.114
-Come on. Let me apologize.
-You dont need to apologize.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.542
I do. Ive given it
a lot of thought

17:06.550 --> 17:08.689
and I see where I missed
your Signal.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.009
I dont want to talk about it.
Okay? I just...

17:10.020 --> 17:11.157
Whats wrong with you?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.491
Im trying to defuse
the situation.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.422
That was no fun at all
on the set today.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.318
I wanna apologize
so we can move on.

17:16.330 --> 17:19.219
Wow, like what? Youre a
dreamboat and a gentleman.

17:19.230 --> 17:23.337
Is there anything I can hate
about you?

17:23.340 --> 17:26.161
Look, Im the one
that should apologize, okay?

17:26.170 --> 17:29.230
Im the crazy-ass bitch,
not you.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.710
Oh, my God. Oh, could I be more
of an insane person?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.278
Youre an actress.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.477
A little passion is part
of the package, right?

17:37.480 --> 17:42.486
Look, I just...
Im from New York, you know?

17:42.490 --> 17:44.720
Its a different world out here.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.654
_I havent learned how_ to tell
if, you know, people like me

17:47.660 --> 17:50.766
or they like the fact that
Im the star of a hit show.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.568
You know, I feel like an
imposter half the time.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.095
I mean, my idea
of a fun evening is

17:56.100 --> 17:58.261
curling up with a cup
of decaf Earl Grey

17:58.270 --> 18:00.170
and a Paddy Chayefsky play.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.501
You forget that Im new
in this town, too.

18:02.510 --> 18:05.149
All I know is the
world of medicine.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.208
In fact, youre gonna have
to remind me

18:06.210 --> 18:10.317
who Paddy Chayefsky is.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.084
I like you, Sean.

18:13.090 --> 18:16.480
I guess... I dont know,
I got scared

18:16.490 --> 18:18.219
when you liked me back so fast.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.290
Thats why I freaked out.
Im really sorry.

18:20.300 --> 18:25.124
So, Ill take a step back,
well go slow.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.470
Look, the thing about me is
that, you know,

18:30.480 --> 18:34.530
whomever I date has
to be a friend first

18:34.540 --> 18:36.474
and then a lover. You know?

18:36.480 --> 18:37.879
-Total|y. Totally.
-Yeah.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.441
Friends. Yeah.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.111
Fnends.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.747
-Friends who kiss?
-Okay.

18:57.430 --> 19:00.308
Great. Great. Great.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.201
Oh, bellissimo.

19:07.240 --> 19:11.643
Oh, bellissimo. Okay, bravo.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.244
We ready for the money shots?

19:14.250 --> 19:16.741
You got your wide-angle lens,
baby?

19:16.750 --> 19:20.140
I need to go to the storeroom
for more film.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.220
Ill be ready when you get back.

19:22.230 --> 19:26.781
Just a chubby, tiger.
I dont shoot hard-ons.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.663
Im literally putting my balls
in your hands, Fiona.

19:36.670 --> 19:40.948
-Are you sure this is...
-Yes.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.908
-Shall I turn around?
-Whats the point?

19:43.910 --> 19:45.548
Its not like youre not gonna
see it on the newsstands

19:45.550 --> 19:47.541
next week, right?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.890
What?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.198
What? What the hell?

20:04.300 --> 20:05.824
Dont look at me like that.
Jesus.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.469
The last time my dick was this
small I was still in diapers.

20:08.470 --> 20:12.304
Stage fright. Its pretty common
in these situations.

20:12.310 --> 20:15.802
Shit. Were gonna have to call
the whole thing off.

20:15.810 --> 20:18.529
What are you?
Leg man, ass man, tit man?

20:18.540 --> 20:20.314
Tit man, why?

20:20.320 --> 20:23.448
Mommy issues. I shouldve known.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.418
Oh, dont flatter yourself,
shorty.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.581
I put my neck on the line
for this shoot.

20:27.590 --> 20:33.699
If your cobra doesnt dance,
Im the one in trouble.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.452
No offense, but do you
really think

20:35.460 --> 20:38.395
the breasts of a woman your age
are gonna play the right tune?

20:40.970 --> 20:44.861
Jesus, Fiona, theyre fantastic.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.009
Why, thank you.
Dont know what it is,

20:47.010 --> 20:51.276
genetics or just plain luck,
but no matter how old I get,

20:51.280 --> 20:54.909
these champagne cups
seem to be frozen in time.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.249
I see were ready.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.525
Oh, yeah, baby. Were ready.

21:08.530 --> 21:09.622
Okay.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.848
-Hello?
-Bad time?

21:20.850 --> 21:24.377
Oh, its the usual
dinnertime madness.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.847
Oh, sorry.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.648
I keep forgetting the time
difference. How are the kids?

21:28.650 --> 21:30.379
They are wonderful.

21:30.390 --> 21:35.851
Exhausting, but Annie cant wait
to come and see you.

21:35.860 --> 21:38.715
She seems to have finally
adjusted to school.

21:38.720 --> 21:42.463
Of course, it helps that her
daddys a television star.

21:42.470 --> 21:45.359
Oh, come on, I only say
a line or two.

21:45.370 --> 21:49.591
Oh, well, I think youre
very believable.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.875
Listen, Christian tells me that
youve met someone and...

21:51.880 --> 21:54.531
Oh, God damn it, Sean!

21:54.540 --> 21:57.031
I didnt want you
to hear it from him.

21:57.040 --> 22:01.079
You know Christian,
he just pushes and pushes and...

22:01.090 --> 22:04.810
Julia, its fine.
Im glad youve met someone.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.412
I want you to be happy.

22:06.420 --> 22:10.698
Well, its just sort of
something that happened.

22:10.700 --> 22:15.820
Hey, its good. Weve both got
to get on with our lives, right?

22:15.830 --> 22:20.324
You know, I thinkI might
have met someone.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.831
Its a little too early
to tell, but...

22:21.840 --> 22:23.398
Thats wonderful.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.435
Yeah. I dont wanna put the cart
before the horse,

22:25.440 --> 22:29.467
but theres definitely
something there.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.973
I mean, shes not your
typical actress or anything.

22:31.980 --> 22:34.016
An actress?

22:34.020 --> 22:37.740
-From the show?
-Yeah.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.526
And what about you?

22:40.530 --> 22:42.486
Tell me about Mr. Right.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.526
Christian says youre
moving in together.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.624
Sean, III... III... Tell you
all about it when the kids

22:47.630 --> 22:49.382
and I come out to see you. Okay?

22:49.390 --> 22:53.838
Its just a little crazy
right now.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.968
Sure, sure. Sorry.

22:56.970 --> 22:59.894
Give them both big kisses
from me.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.643
-Take care, Jules.
-Yeah. You, too.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.556
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.390
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.095
-They let you out early.
-Yeah.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.796
-How are you?
-Good. You know.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.631
Hey, theres this restaurant
in Malibu.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.029
-Its right on the beach...
-Actually, you know what, Sean?

23:34.040 --> 23:37.430
This is _sort
of a professmnal call.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.716
What could you possibly
wanna change?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.608
Well, its about the show.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.147
-Can... Do you mind ifI sit?
-Yeah, yeah.

23:53.660 --> 23:58.495
Years ago, when some casting
agents saw me off off-Broadway,

23:58.500 --> 24:01.799
they said that if I ever wanted
to do the Hollywood thing

24:01.810 --> 24:04.062
that Id have
to drop some weight.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.561
You know, if I wanted a shot.
And I did.

24:06.570 --> 24:11.872
I wanted it, badly.
I dropped the weight and then...

24:11.880 --> 24:15.543
And then I got plucked out of
obscurity to do this pilot, and

24:17.980 --> 24:19.516
I mean, I think its only
a matter of time.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.489
Im gonna have
to do a nude scene.

24:22.490 --> 24:24.720
I mean, Aidans made
that really clear.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.652
Kate.

24:26.660 --> 24:30.960
What is it? A little cellulite?
I mean, who cares?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.938
-Just show me. Its okay.
-I cant.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.134
You know what? Its bad enough.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.698
The pictures of how
I used to look

24:35.700 --> 24:37.463
are showing up on the Internet.

24:37.470 --> 24:40.746
You havent seen them yet.
You will. Shit, I hate Google.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.103
Look, you can show me anything.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.840
I mean, old pictures,
you in the flesh.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.148
Im attracted to you.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.054
Can you turn around?

24:52.720 --> 24:54.210
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:12.540 --> 25:14.974
Youre dating a plastic surgeon,
okay?

25:14.980 --> 25:16.607
Ive pushed and pulled
enough flesh

25:16.610 --> 25:19.078
to know that beauty
is more than skin deep.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.184
Okay. You can turn around.

25:27.590 --> 25:31.959
I had gastric bypass
to drop the weight,

25:31.960 --> 25:35.020
and after I lost 100 pounds,
this is the result.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.249
No problem.

26:08.730 --> 26:14.589
Question, whats hot and bare
and hard all over?

26:15.800 --> 26:16.994
You remember what this is,
Lizzy?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.833
Cheap porn? Yeah,
Im familiar with it.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.774
I cant believe you
posed for that magazine.

26:21.780 --> 26:24.806
-What do you think, huh?
-It is so Burt Reynolds 1972.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.971
-Thank you.
-Very becoming for a doctor.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.675
Youve heard
of Doctors Without Borders?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.079
Meet Doctor Without Dignity.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.310
Okay. Just for your information,

26:32.320 --> 26:35.084
Fiona says that
this publication is iconic.

26:35.090 --> 26:36.580
Moronic?

26:36.590 --> 26:38.319
Moronic, iconic, thats very
good. I like that.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.685
So heres my thinking.

26:39.690 --> 26:41.362
Only half of Miami got
to see my dick

26:41.370 --> 26:42.997
and look how much business
that brought in.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.321
Wait till this little puppy
comes out

26:45.330 --> 26:48.128
with Dr. Christian Troy, okay?

26:48.130 --> 26:51.372
This office wont be flooded,
itll be underwater.

26:51.380 --> 26:54.736
Right, big boy,
take your dick outside.

26:54.740 --> 26:57.106
Huh? Does that make you
feel sexy?

26:57.110 --> 26:59.738
Lets do some stapling.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.789
Whats whats-her-face
doing here?

27:02.790 --> 27:04.849
She just wanted a few touch-ups.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.943
Wow. What, she lose 100 pounds
in a week or something?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.918
This is the chick you took
to the awards thing, right?

27:08.920 --> 27:11.696
Her name is Kate. She happens
to be pretty special.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.396
She seems very special. You just
add a mast and a good wind,

27:14.400 --> 27:16.220
and you sail her
around the planet.

27:16.230 --> 27:17.993
I happen to like her, Christian.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.766
I dont give a shit
if she was once fat.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.308
Julia met someone,
you met someone. I get it.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.062
The only thing youve got
is a picture

27:27.070 --> 27:28.833
of your cock in a magazine.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.344
This magazine is gonna bring
in more of LAs hotties

27:32.350 --> 27:33.772
than you could ever imagine,
my friend.

27:33.780 --> 27:35.714
Look at this guy, okay? Come on.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.779
You wont have _to settle
for these rejects

27:37.780 --> 27:41.181
from the Macys Day Parade.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.384
The phones havent
stopped ringing

27:42.390 --> 27:44.119
and youre booked solid
all next week.

27:44.130 --> 27:47.281
_ _And theres_a walk-in _
waiting for you in your office.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.429
Guess they wanna know
who the big dick is.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.191
Tell me what you dont like
about yourself.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.361
What I dont like,
sweetheart, is that

28:00.370 --> 28:04.101
I dont have someone
like you in my life.

28:04.110 --> 28:06.999
Okay.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.944
That Im sitting here

28:08.950 --> 28:11.714
and youre sitting
all the way over there.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.451
Im not a dermatologist.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.281
I dont do full body
mole checks.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.425
-Come to apologize?
-For what?

28:30.430 --> 28:32.933
Filling your appointment book
with paying clients?

28:32.940 --> 28:35.738
I promised to get you work,
not get you laid.

28:35.740 --> 28:38.732
I didnt think you had any
problem in that department.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.879
You certainly bedded Carly
without my help.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.711
So, thats what this is about,
huh? Revenge?

28:43.720 --> 28:45.381
People I get revenge on

28:45.390 --> 28:48.018
arent double booked
for six weeks ahead.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.956
You have tapped into
the lifeblood of Hollywood.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.326
You never heard
of the Gay Mafia?

28:54.330 --> 28:58.027
Get the boys
and everyone else follows.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.758
Paul Lynde is waiting in your
office, Christian.

29:02.770 --> 29:05.830
Screw you, boob-tube boy.
And just for the record,

29:05.840 --> 29:08.001
my layout has brought
in twice as much business

29:08.010 --> 29:09.432
as your crappy TV show.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.514
Huh?

29:13.520 --> 29:16.444
Tell him about the mafia.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.010
- Is your divorce ﬁnal, Sean?
-Yes. Why?

29:19.020 --> 29:21.250
Good, it means we wont have
to fudge it.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.922
People Magazine has
requested you

29:23.930 --> 29:27.286
_ for their _
50-Most-Eligible-Bachelor issue.

29:27.290 --> 29:29.758
-Him?
-I pitched you both, of course,

29:29.760 --> 29:33.093
but Sean is the only one
on TV every week.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.933
The photo shoots tomorrow.
Can you work that?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.999
Christian will have to pick up
a couple of my patients,

29:38.000 --> 29:43.074
but something like this
could only be good for business.

29:43.080 --> 29:48.040
You can do Kates follow-up
for me, cant you?

29:48.050 --> 29:49.278
Sure.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.557
Oh, Dr. Troy. Is Sean coming?

29:59.560 --> 30:01.221
Oh, you mean, one
of People magazines

30:01.230 --> 30:03.095
50 most eligible bachelors?

30:03.100 --> 30:06.297
Hes at a photo shoot right now
getting his highlights redone.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.892
Youre kidding.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.028
I was saying the same thing
when I heard it myself.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.975
Okay, I need to see
how youre healing.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.904
Could you take off your gown
for me, please?

30:16.910 --> 30:19.071
Oh, sure.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.348
Very nice.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.588
You could do the sequel
to Nine 1/2 Weeks in a month

30:34.600 --> 30:38.092
and nobody would know
the difference.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.103
And yet oddly, you seem
disappointed.

30:41.110 --> 30:43.260
No, its... Ijust...

30:43.270 --> 30:47.468
I thought Sean would
wanna be here.

30:47.470 --> 30:51.179
He hasnt really talked to me
much since the operation.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.375
What can I expect, right? I
mean...

30:53.380 --> 30:55.519
He just shaved 20 pounds of
loose skin off my body.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.114
Im not attractive.
He can do so much better.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.872
Is that what you think?

30:59.880 --> 31:04.249
Once a fatty, always a fatty.
I know how men in this town are.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.457
Well, Im a man in this town
and Id be honored

31:07.460 --> 31:09.348
to have you on my arm.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.092
Maybe...
Maybe we could go out to dinner?

31:17.940 --> 31:20.067
Youve always been beautiful.

31:20.070 --> 31:24.404
Now youre...
Now youre a complete knockout.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.156
Careful where you poke
down there.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.048
Im gonna need that later.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.357
What are you doing?

31:40.360 --> 31:42.419
You like it?
I just got it from Barneys.

31:42.430 --> 31:43.897
Just need a few adjustments,
thats all.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.367
Why do you need a tux?

31:45.370 --> 31:48.521
Peoples Choice Awards, my
friend. Black-tie affair.

31:48.530 --> 31:51.602
And I told Kate I wouldnt
be seen dead in a rental.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.432
Youre going out with Kate?
My Kate? You cant be serious.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.578
I wouldnt spend 2,000 bucks
on a brand new suit

31:58.580 --> 31:59.933
just to be joking around.

31:59.940 --> 32:02.181
Those fat comments
during her surgery,

32:02.190 --> 32:03.316
you just said all that
to push me away

32:03.320 --> 32:04.389
so you could swoop in,
didnt you?

32:04.390 --> 32:06.119
Now youre just being paranoid.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.213
Wouldnt you be if your best
friend kept trying to take away

32:08.220 --> 32:09.346
everything you ever cared about?

32:09.350 --> 32:10.282
You never cared about Kate!

32:10.290 --> 32:11.655
You were embarrassed by her.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.390
Thats why you did the surgery
in the first place.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.698
And just so you know,
she looks fantastic.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.124
If theres anybody to blame,
its you.

32:20.130 --> 32:23.361
Recovery. We have a situation.

32:23.370 --> 32:24.667
Whats going on?

32:24.670 --> 32:27.002
Her pulse is thready
and shes non-responsive.

32:27.010 --> 32:29.069
And theres an empty bottle of
pills on the nightstand.

32:29.070 --> 32:30.935
-Rozerem. Sleeping pills.
-Is she gonna die?

32:30.940 --> 32:32.612
- How many of these she took?
-I dont know.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.645
Give me a gastric lavage.
We need to pump her stomach. Go!

32:34.650 --> 32:36.117
What do you mean you dont know?
Youre sitting three feet away.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.542
- What happened?
- I dont know.

32:37.550 --> 32:39.575
We got in a fight over whod
work the corner next week.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.457
And I said she couldnt compete
with me anymore.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.950
And I went to the bathroom
and when I came back,

32:42.960 --> 32:45.588
she was groggy
and she said she was happy.

32:45.590 --> 32:47.478
-And she was finally gonna win.
-Win? Win what?

32:47.490 --> 32:49.128
I dont know.
It didnt make sense.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.360
She said after today,
she was gonna go down in history

32:51.370 --> 32:54.692
as the best Marilyn Monroe
in the biz.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.294
-Jesus.
-Joyce, can you hear me?

32:57.300 --> 33:00.736
How many pills did you take?
Joyce?

33:00.740 --> 33:02.276
No, we gotta do this.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.679
-I got it.
-No, I got it.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.477
Okay, it doesnt matter,
would one of you

33:05.480 --> 33:07.573
please put it down her throat?

33:19.390 --> 33:21.722
-I was gonna grab that one.
-Oh, bullshit.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.391
Thats not bullshit,
Ive hardly eaten all day.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.719
I need something
to tide me over.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.721
Well, what happened
to "Im lactose intolerant"?

33:26.730 --> 33:30.097
Hey, I am asshole intolerant!
So take it outside

33:30.100 --> 33:31.374
or take up a sport
where you both

33:31.380 --> 33:33.132
can beat the crap
out of each other

33:33.140 --> 33:35.677
somewhere else.
Cause Im sick of watching it.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.604
A woman almost died
under your watch today,

33:38.610 --> 33:41.283
and you deal with it
by fighting over a Yoplait?

33:41.290 --> 33:43.417
Give me the Yoplait.
Give it to me.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.786
Knock, knock.

33:45.790 --> 33:50.147
- Hey, I didnt think you...
-Julia, we werent expecting.

33:50.150 --> 33:53.028
-I didnt mean to interrupt.
-Oh, it doesnt matter.

33:53.030 --> 33:56.750
They never listen to me. Im
just white noise in a lab coat.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.423
-Jules, what are you doing here?
-I decided to just come.

34:00.430 --> 34:05.561
It felt so awkward on the phone.
I thought, "Why wait?"

34:05.570 --> 34:07.367
This is an important move
for me,

34:07.370 --> 34:09.804
and I need you two
to be on board.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.711
Well, for the kids.
I left them with my mother,

34:12.720 --> 34:15.314
and shes gonna bring them
in a couple of days.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.311
-Oh, of course were on board.
-Yep.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.618
Im sure if you like him,
hes gotta be great.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.123
We just want you to be happy.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.325
-Exactly.
-Thanks.

34:24.330 --> 34:28.187
So, when do we get to meet
the lucky bastard?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.078
Did you bring him
with you or what?

34:30.090 --> 34:32.263
Olis not actually...

34:32.270 --> 34:33.669
Oli?

34:33.670 --> 34:35.535
-Oli, sounds very upper crust.
-Yeah.

34:35.540 --> 34:41.103
-Is Oli rich?
-Yes. Very.

34:41.110 --> 34:42.702
And its Olivia.

35:03.770 --> 35:07.729
So, how long have you been
playing snooker?

35:07.730 --> 35:10.767
I got into it late in life.
I had a good teacher.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.499
I bet you did.

35:12.510 --> 35:15.570
Whats a dyke bar without a gang
of Minnesota Fats wannabes?

35:15.580 --> 35:16.729
My daughter taught me pool.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.379
You have a daughter? That is
fantastic.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.245
What about daddy,
you pull him out of the drawer

35:21.250 --> 35:22.649
for Thanksgiving
to baste the turkey?

35:22.650 --> 35:24.538
She was conceived
in my college dorm

35:24.550 --> 35:26.245
the good old-fashioned way,

35:26.250 --> 35:31.392
by adding two hard bodies
to a quart of rum and stirring.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.623
Very kinky.

35:34.630 --> 35:36.791
-Wheres poppa now?
-Well, where do you think?

35:36.800 --> 35:40.327
After he impregnated me,
I bit off his head.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.400
How did your mother respond
when she found out?

35:42.410 --> 35:45.231
Well, you know Erica.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.801
She thought that being in a more
egalitarian relationship

35:48.810 --> 35:50.334
would be good for me.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.570
Until she found out that Olivia
was a doctor of

35:52.580 --> 35:54.468
traditional Chinese medicine

35:54.480 --> 35:57.847
and then she became
a lesbian snake-oil peddler.

35:57.850 --> 36:00.444
I bet I started looking
pretty good to her.

36:04.430 --> 36:07.581
So was Olivia your first?

36:10.430 --> 36:14.867
I dont know if its a question
of being gay or not, Sean.

36:14.870 --> 36:18.169
I just fell in love with her.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.694
You were in love with me.

36:19.700 --> 36:23.739
Yes, but this is different
somehow.

36:23.750 --> 36:27.242
You know, its easier.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.208
The sex, communication.

36:30.210 --> 36:33.316
Did you ever fantasize about
women when I was screwing you?

36:35.590 --> 36:40.812
Yes. But you know, a lot of
straight women do. Its common.

36:42.330 --> 36:46.460
I am so sorry, Sean.

36:46.470 --> 36:49.268
I put you through hell
and maybe

36:49.270 --> 36:53.479
all the time this was
the reason why.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.938
-I kicked his ass.
-True, she did.

36:56.940 --> 36:59.738
-You ready, babe?
-Oh, why not stay for dinner?

36:59.740 --> 37:02.789
You can explain the Indigo Girls
phenomenon to me.

37:02.790 --> 37:05.315
We have a dinner date
with my daughter.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.345
Ill be in town until Sunday.

37:07.350 --> 37:11.252
Well have dinner
at the weekend.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.591
Bye.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.504
I cant stop wondering.

37:21.510 --> 37:22.807
You think she yells out "Oli"
or "Lim" when she...

37:22.810 --> 37:24.539
-Oh, shut up.
-I didnt say anything.

37:24.540 --> 37:25.734
Its what youre not saying,

37:25.740 --> 37:27.367
its what I know youre
thinking.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.258
Just say it.

37:29.270 --> 37:30.862
Youre thinking she
wouldnt be a lesbian

37:30.870 --> 37:32.417
if shed been married to you.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.876
That I must be such a lousy lay

37:33.880 --> 37:37.475
that my wife went from dwarf
humping to carpet munching.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.516
-Its not funny.
-Im not laughing at you.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.387
Im laughing at us.
I mean, come on, it is funny.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.823
Think about it.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.253
After all these years,
Julia was the reason for our

37:46.260 --> 37:47.682
"Whos got the biggest dick"
contest,

37:47.690 --> 37:50.750
and now we find out
she doesnt even like them.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.958
Shes a dyke.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.528
-Julias a dyke.
-All right.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.428
-Dont call her that.
-You get that?

37:58.440 --> 38:01.807
Shes the mother of our
children, okay?

38:01.810 --> 38:03.277
Carpet munchers nicer.

38:03.280 --> 38:08.001
-Beaver bumper, yeah.
-Muff diver.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.376
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

38:14.390 --> 38:17.587
Well, now neither
of us gets her.

38:17.590 --> 38:20.718
Too bad she didnt figure it
out when we were in college.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.564
Ive spent a lot of years
barking up the wrong tree.

38:29.470 --> 38:33.907
Look, I only went after Kate
because you wanted her.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.798
I... Im sorry, all right?

38:35.810 --> 38:37.004
I dont know what it is,
its like Im

38:37.010 --> 38:39.308
hypnotized or something.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.617
Here. Better not waste any time.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.856
Shes yours, not mine.

39:01.060 --> 39:02.436
Thank you.

39:19.450 --> 39:21.827
-Kate?
-Be right down.

39:25.890 --> 39:30.088
Wow. You look beautiful.

39:30.090 --> 39:33.491
-Please accept my apologies.
-For what?

39:33.500 --> 39:34.762
Pretending to be a great guy
and then disappearing?

39:34.770 --> 39:36.499
Wheres Christian?

39:36.500 --> 39:40.368
He bowed out when I told him
that we were seeing each other.

39:40.370 --> 39:43.498
So I dont have a say?

39:43.510 --> 39:45.501
You two just play
pass-the-fat-girl

39:45.510 --> 39:46.670
and assume I should be
grateful that

39:46.680 --> 39:48.443
anyone shows up
at my doorstep at all?

39:48.450 --> 39:49.576
Am I caught
in the middle of some

39:49.580 --> 39:51.002
weird game that you
two get off on?

39:51.010 --> 39:52.614
Absolutely not.

39:52.620 --> 39:55.487
I mean, my partner has
a definite eye for the ladies,

39:55.490 --> 39:58.379
but the reason I kind
of disappeared

39:58.390 --> 39:59.857
has nothing to do with you.

39:59.860 --> 40:04.888
I got caught up.
My ex-wife came to town and...

40:04.900 --> 40:08.461
She_ came to inform me_
shes in a new relationship.

40:08.470 --> 40:12.429
Well... What, are you still
in love with her?

40:12.440 --> 40:15.534
Trust me, Julia and I are over.

40:15.540 --> 40:19.499
Truly, finally over.

40:19.510 --> 40:23.947
Thats why Im here.

40:23.950 --> 40:27.113
Put these in some water,

40:27.120 --> 40:29.816
and Ill wait for you
in the limo.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.518
Ill drive.

40:33.530 --> 40:37.751
We can play the chauffeur
and the naughty starlet.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.196
Why is it so hard
to say no to you?

40:41.200 --> 40:44.636
Because I look so handsome
in this tux?

40:44.640 --> 40:48.861
Yeah.

40:48.870 --> 40:51.668
Come on, Kate.

40:53.220 --> 40:55.108
I dont wanna go.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.178
Do you think that
Hargitay ladys

40:56.180 --> 40:59.570
gonna kick your ass again?

40:59.580 --> 41:02.219
Im just sick of actors
competing with other actors

41:02.230 --> 41:04.755
for meaningless trophies.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.580
Yes, shes gonna kick
my ass again.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.184
Im gonna kiss you.
Are you gonna hit me?

41:09.190 --> 41:10.726
I dont know.

41:23.110 --> 41:27.479
Why dont we stay in, order out,

41:27.480 --> 41:29.471
and watch an old movie?

41:29.480 --> 41:31.857
That sounds perfect.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.569
Come on in here.

42:10.050 --> 42:11.995
Cheeseburger.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.127
Say, "Thats all right, mama."

42:14.130 --> 42:15.256
God bless you. Thank you,
sweetie.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.524
Hey, Elvis.

42:17.530 --> 42:18.952
-El\_/is. _
-How you d0ing, sweetie?

42:18.960 --> 42:20.188
Hey, fat Elvis.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.861
Hey, hey, come here
for a second.

42:21.870 --> 42:25.704
-Whats up, man?
-Im looking for Marilyn Monroe.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.837
Actually, two Marilyn Monroes.
You seen them?

42:27.840 --> 42:31.162
Yeah, I might know
where theyre at, baby.

42:31.170 --> 42:33.616
All right, theyre
right over there

42:33.620 --> 42:35.315
amongst all the Asian tourists.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.209
-Beautiful. Thank you.
-Go get them, poppa.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.676
All right.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.819
Come on, whos next for Elvis?

42:56.870 --> 42:58.690
Whatever happened to
the battle of the blondes?

42:58.700 --> 43:02.648
Oh, Dr. Troy, what are you
doing here?

43:02.650 --> 43:05.778
I always do follow-ups
on my movie star patients.

43:05.780 --> 43:07.145
What happened?

43:07.150 --> 43:09.641
We decided that two Marilyns
were better than one.

43:09.650 --> 43:11.345
Especially since Joyce
came up with the idea

43:11.350 --> 43:13.989
of us both wearing the costume
from The Seven Year Itch.

43:13.990 --> 43:17.357
It really shows off our brand
new tits, dont you think?

43:17.360 --> 43:19.715
I cant think of a better way
to advertise.

43:19.720 --> 43:20.857
Maybe you should
hand out my card.

43:20.860 --> 43:22.623
Oh, wed love to.

43:22.630 --> 43:25.269
Especially since youre the
reason that were friends again.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.965
You did save my life,

43:26.970 --> 43:29.689
but you made me realize
my life was worth saving.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.032
If only the real Marilyn had
had as good a friend.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.874
Oh, yes. But if only she had as
good a business mind as you do.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.609
Were making more money
together than

43:37.610 --> 43:40.704
we ever did competing,
thats for sure.

43:40.710 --> 43:43.884
I think I know a way
you can make more money

43:43.890 --> 43:48.714
than just standing
on this corner, ladies.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.018
What did you have in mind?

44:07.910 --> 44:10.902
Make me feel like a star.

44:10.910 --> 44:15.176
I wanna be loved by you

44:15.180 --> 44:21.141
Just you and nobody else but you

44:21.150 --> 44:27.328
I wanna be loved by you, alone

44:27.330 --> 44:30.322
Boop-boop—be-doo

44:30.330 --> 44:34.061
I wanna be kissed by you

44:34.070 --> 44:40.191
Just you, nobody else but you

44:40.200 --> 44:46.673
I wanna be kissed by you, alone

44:48.110 --> 44:51.989
Dr. Troy. Oh, youre wonderful.
