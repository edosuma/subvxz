At the beginning of summer,

00:06.172 --> 00:06.965
{\an8}I thought
I was in total control.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.926
I don't want there
to be another girl.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.636
{\an1}I don't really want
that again.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.971
Boy, was I wrong.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.639
Is it not, like, obvious

00:14.723 --> 00:17.100
{\an1}that I don't want you
hooking up with my friend?

00:17.183 --> 00:17.684
But at least
I wasn't Chloe.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.853
She started the summer

00:19.936 --> 00:20.937
thinking she had
so many friends...

00:21.020 --> 00:23.440
{\an1}Do you want to explain
what's up with you

00:23.523 --> 00:24.858
{\an1}talking to Brandon
so much?

00:24.941 --> 00:26.943
...but then Amanda put her
in the hospital...

00:27.026 --> 00:29.112
{\an1}(Alex)
Holy (bleep).

00:29.195 --> 00:32.531
...and Alex and Pauly,
they treated her even worse.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.284
{\an1}We should do
the big dinner or something.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.703
{\an8}A big dinner?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.291
{\an5}(Juliette)
It was so bad,
she was rethinking

00:41.374 --> 00:42.917
everything in her life...

00:43.001 --> 00:44.711
I can't do this anymore.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.505
...and pulling away
from our group.

00:47.589 --> 00:51.134
As for Madisson, she just
acted like she had it all...

00:51.217 --> 00:53.094
{\an4}(Alex)
I hope you can
stick around here.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.554
{\an1}It'd be nice to have you
around again.

00:54.637 --> 00:58.349
It'll be a good summer.
We'll make it good.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.395
...but everyone knew
Alex chose me over her...

01:02.479 --> 01:04.480
{\an1}Why does he
do this to me?!

01:04.563 --> 01:05.940
He hasn't changed
one bit.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.694
...so she moved on
to Brandon...

01:09.778 --> 01:11.154
{\an4}(Brandon)
What do you think
Alex will think,

01:11.237 --> 01:12.989
me taking you
out on a date?

01:13.072 --> 01:14.616
Oh, I don't know.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.075
...but who knew
if that would last?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.995
It seemed like nobody's
relationship was safe

01:19.078 --> 01:20.663
with Alex hanging around.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.915
Look, I told you
I'd take you out,

01:21.998 --> 01:23.500
now you're
driving my boat.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.585

Once Kelsey got a taste
of Alex's world...

01:25.668 --> 01:26.503
{\an3}Whoo!

01:26.586 --> 01:29.589
...and Alex and I were
finally done...

01:29.672 --> 01:32.175
{\an1}You and I need to,
like, end whatever we are,

01:32.258 --> 01:33.676
because I don't want
to do that anymore.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.261
...it was only
a matter of time

01:35.345 --> 01:37.263
before Kelsey
went after Alex, too...

01:37.347 --> 01:40.099
{\an4}We're all going swimming
later if you wanna...

01:37.347 --> 01:40.099
Get to know you better.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.144
{\an1}It seems like you always
wanna be around him.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.854
{\an5}I literally just said--

01:43.228 --> 01:44.854
I'm gonna go.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.525
...but I wasn't about to let
Kelsey and Alex off that easy...

01:48.608 --> 01:53.029
{\an1}If they went upstairs,
it's not to play checkers.

01:53.112 --> 01:57.033
...and I didn't stop there.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.828
But just like everything
about this summer,

01:59.911 --> 02:02.372

really don't understand

05:18.901 --> 05:21.904
{\an1}how important
this habitat is,

05:21.988 --> 05:24.073
{\an1}especially, like,
the mangroves.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.533
Like, the manatees.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.077
{\an1}If there's no mangroves,
no beds, they won't be here.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
{\an5}Is that where they live?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
{\an1}They live up
in the mangroves, yeah,

05:30.246 --> 05:33.166
{\an4}and, like,
outside the channel.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.166
{\an3}Aww.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.459
See, like, I've lived here
my whole life,

05:34.542 --> 05:35.710
and I didn't know that.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.920

little things you learn

05:38.004 --> 05:39.213
{\an1}as you go.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.090
But it's extremely,
extremely important

05:41.174 --> 05:43.092
{\an1}that we preserve
what we have.

I don't wanna

05:58.983 --> 06:00.860

06:00.943 --> 06:02.278
Yeah.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.500
I don't know.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.794
{\an1}It's just, like,
she's an awesome girl.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.005
{\an1}But we just don't have,
like, anything in common.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.799
Really?
I can see that.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.759
For instance, this place.

06:24.842 --> 06:25.468
{\an1}Like, we'll be together
and she'll be like,

06:25.551 --> 06:27.303
{\an1}"Oh, I wanna go
to New York,"

06:27.387 --> 06:29.013
{\an5}or "I wanna go to L.A."

06:27.387 --> 06:29.013
{\an3}Yeah.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.306
And I get it, you know,

06:30.389 --> 06:32.975
{\an1}but for me, uh,
what if I'm going

06:33.059 --> 06:35.436
{\an1}into a relationship, you always
gotta think, like, long-term.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.355
{\an1}Like what if this
actually does work out?

06:37.438 --> 06:39.440
{\an6}Yeah.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.440
{\an1}Like, it doesn't seem
like she has any interest

06:39.524 --> 06:41.067
in staying local.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.360
{\an1}And as a kid, I just
enjoyed it so much here--

06:42.443 --> 06:44.570
{\an6}Yeah.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.570
{\an1}--that this place
is my backyard.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.532
{\an1}I think maybe that's, like,
what she doesn't get,

06:47.615 --> 06:49.033
'cause, like,
she didn't grow up here.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.744
And, like, we see,
like, how childhood here

06:51.828 --> 06:52.745
is, like,
the best thing ever.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.331
{\an4}I mean--

06:52.829 --> 06:55.331
And, like, raising
a family here

06:55.414 --> 06:58.000
is like ideal.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.961
But it's tough.

{\an8}Didn't you guys
go on a date?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.974
{\an8}I really like him,
but him and Kelsey,

07:55.057 --> 07:56.726
{\an7}like, just broke up
you know?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.728
{\an8}But I mean Garrett
seems really sweet.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.980
{\an7}He's so sweet,
and it's so refreshing

08:01.063 --> 08:02.565
{\an7}to, like, have someone
who's respectful

08:02.648 --> 08:04.734
{\an8}and stuff like that.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.734
{\an8}Exactly.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.069
{\an1}I mean, yeah,
I really like him,

08:07.153 --> 08:09.655
{\an1}but... do you guys
think that

08:09.739 --> 08:12.366
it looks like
we're doing it

08:12.450 --> 08:15.661
{\an1}out of spite,
getting together?

08:15.745 --> 08:18.789
{\an1}I'm not gonna lie.
Like...

08:18.873 --> 08:21.626
{\an1}it might have been why
I started with him.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.503
(all laughing)

08:24.587 --> 08:26.380
Exactly, yeah.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.757
{\an1}Now I actually
do like him but--

08:27.840 --> 08:28.841
{\an5}Yeah, feelings change.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.841
Feelings change, yeah.

{\an6}Yeah.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.385
At least you guys
are mature about it.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.597
{\an1}Yeah, I really do, like,
think that, you know,

08:35.681 --> 08:37.515
he's a great guy
and that I could

08:37.600 --> 08:40.144
{\an1}definitely see myself,
like, being with him, but...

08:40.227 --> 08:42.730
So do you think
he's, like, over her?

08:42.813 --> 08:46.859
{\an1}I think that, like,
she just hurt him too much.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.444
{\an3}Yeah.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.444
Exactly.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.279
I don't think
he's over her

08:50.363 --> 08:52.531
{\an1}just because...
he still sees her

08:52.615 --> 08:56.118
{\an4}and like--

08:52.615 --> 08:56.118
If he's not
fully over Kelsey,

you need to make sure
you keep your guard up.

where it's honestly--

10:05.438 --> 10:06.731
You know, Chloe,
every single day

10:06.814 --> 10:09.317
I look for new ways
to try to better myself,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.152
{\an1}What-- what-- what are
you doing every day?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.863
{\an1}You think going out
and drinking and doing drugs

10:13.946 --> 10:16.073
is bettering yourself,
Paul? I mean, come on.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.409
And that's something that
I've had to reflect on.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.874
{\an3}(sighs)

10:24.957 --> 10:27.209
{\an1}Quite frankly,
part of working on myself

10:27.293 --> 10:28.794
{\an1}is removing toxic people
from my life.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.549
{\an1}And honestly, that's all
you've been to me this summer.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.384
It's just time and time again.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.802
Every time you're around me,
I'm put in a toxic situation,

10:36.886 --> 10:41.891
{\an1}and I'm just... I need to
remove it from my life, Paul.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.477
No every day does
somebody deal with...

10:44.560 --> 10:47.521
losing their mother
and father a year apart

10:47.605 --> 10:50.775
when they're
20 years old.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.526
I live life
in a reality

10:52.610 --> 10:53.736
where I never
lost my parents.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.697
I just pretend like
it never happened

10:56.781 --> 10:58.407
and they don't exist.

10:58.491 --> 11:03.162
So, I compensate with
drinking and drugs

11:03.245 --> 11:04.997
to kind of
take me out of

11:05.081 --> 11:07.541
the reality that I
really do live in.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.962
I'm trying to
numb the pain.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.173
