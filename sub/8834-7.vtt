01:18.583 --> 01:21.625
There. Perfect.

01:21.709 --> 01:26.041
Um, Baloo, shouldn't we be
warming up the plane or something?

01:26.166 --> 01:28.959
The client said
to be ready at midnight.

01:29.041 --> 01:33.166

your engines in an uproar.

01:49.417 --> 01:53.000
Hurry!
Get this to Cape Suzette by morning.

01:53.083 --> 01:57.417
No problem. It's a piece of cake.
It's only midnight.

01:57.625 --> 02:00.458
-Plenty of time--
-Go, go, go.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.959

Whoa!

02:13.834 --> 02:15.750
[engine revs]

02:16.709 --> 02:21.667
Oh, man. Some people
sure are antsy in the pantsy.

02:24.166 --> 02:28.125
I wonder what that guy
was so hopped up about.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.542
[rattling]

02:30.625 --> 02:35.542
Oh, well, let's say we stop at Louie's
for a burger and fries.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.125
Baloo!

02:37.208 --> 02:40.542
Hey, wait a minute.
My stomach says it's all right.

02:40.625 --> 02:45.333
And whatever's OK by the big guy
is all right by me.

02:45.417 --> 02:48.875
[Kit] Ask your stomach what Rebecca said
the last time we were late.

02:48.959 --> 02:52.750
[Baloo] Relax.
We got till morning to make it back.

02:52.834 --> 02:58.625
Besides, it's just Louie's.
We zip in, we eat and zip out.

02:58.709 --> 03:01.709
It's not like
we're going to party till dawn.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.583
Oh, no.
It is dawn!

03:09.667 --> 03:12.500
-No, little hand's on seven.
-Oh, seven.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.250
-Big hand's on...
-Thirteen?

03:14.333 --> 03:16.000
-No, 12.
-Oh, yeah, 12.

03:16.083 --> 03:19.250
-So, he'll be here in... one minute.
-One minute.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.750
Yeah, and he better not be late, lady,
or the deal's kaput.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.458
-Kaput.
-The boss likes everyone following orders.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.166
-Oh, yeah. Following orders.
-Yeah, following orders.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.250
[Baloo]
Oh, we're not gonna make it.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.834
I'm gonna say we ran into a hurricane.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.417
Nah, you used that story last week.

03:36.542 --> 03:41.041
-Oh. H-How about a volcano?
-Week before.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.667
-Cannibals?
-Last Tuesday.

03:43.750 --> 03:47.500
Oh, baby, this is serious.
I got it!

03:47.583 --> 03:50.875
We'll tell her we were
attacked by air pirates.

03:50.959 --> 03:54.125
Aw, Baloo, you used that one yesterday.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.208
There we were.
Outnumbered a jillion-to-one.

03:57.291 --> 04:02.375
We were dodging and weaving and dodging.
Oh, baby, what a fight!

04:02.458 --> 04:06.542
But it was my double-decker pretzel loop
that did them in.

04:06.625 --> 04:07.875
-[engine revving]
-[Kit] Baloo!

04:15.875 --> 04:18.791
No buts.
Give me them bucks.

04:20.208 --> 04:24.583
-Wait! There he is!
-Yeah, he is.

04:35.625 --> 04:38.458
Air pirates!
Oh, what a battle!

04:38.542 --> 04:41.917
We rocked them, we socked them...
Uh, sure, we're a little late,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.959
but, hey, we made it!
Ta-da!

04:52.333 --> 04:53.375
Uh-oh.

04:56.291 --> 05:00.208
-[rhino] Hey, where's the box?
-[gorilla] Yeah, the box.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.792
[rhino] What happened to it?

05:02.917 --> 05:04.291
It ain't here.

05:04.458 --> 05:07.792
The boss is not gonna like this.

05:11.834 --> 05:15.583
[both]
Wait till we tell him what you did.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.542
No, wait.
We'll send out a plane for it.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.166
-A boat--
-Nix, lady.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.417
-The boss had to have that box by noon.
-Yeah, by noon.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.875
[car engine starting]

05:29.000 --> 05:30.417
[tires screech]

05:31.709 --> 05:34.583
Well, little britches,
looks like I blew it.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.542
But I guess it could've been worse.

05:36.625 --> 05:40.166
-She could've yelled at me.
-It's worse.

05:40.250 --> 05:46.208
You clod! You nincompoop!
Can't you even follow simple instructions?

05:46.291 --> 05:49.375
Look, Becky,
we were rushing to make it back, but--

05:49.458 --> 05:52.375
If you stayed on schedule,
you wouldn't have had to rush,

05:52.458 --> 05:57.291
and then you wouldn't have lost the box,
and then we wouldn't be out $10,000.

05:58.166 --> 06:02.750
-Ten grand?
-Yes, ten grand.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.542
Oh, man, I've never lost my cargo before.

06:11.625 --> 06:16.291
Late, yeah, but always with my cargo.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.041
How am I ever going to
make up for this one?

06:20.125 --> 06:24.834
-Swear off burgers and fries?
-Hey, I got it!

06:27.208 --> 06:28.333
[door opens]

06:28.417 --> 06:29.667
[Baloo clears throat]

06:29.750 --> 06:31.583
Um, Miss Cunningham?

06:31.667 --> 06:33.041
[door closes]

06:34.166 --> 06:37.458
I, uh... I just wanted
to say that, well...

06:37.542 --> 06:43.166
Well, I goofed up royally, and I'm...
I'm sorry.

06:47.291 --> 06:51.333
-And?
-And? Oh, yeah.

06:51.417 --> 06:57.208
And the next time, old Baloo's gonna
follow your instructions to the letter.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.375
Glad to hear it.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.750
[grunts]
What's this?

07:01.834 --> 07:04.750
Instructions for your next job.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.750
And this is to make sure
you're on time for it.

07:08.834 --> 07:14.208
-And just what is the next job?
-A sightseeing tour around the city.

07:14.291 --> 07:17.875
[gags]
A tour? They're the worst!

07:19.166 --> 07:21.583
Oh, I like it, though.
I like it.

07:21.667 --> 07:25.959
-Great idea, Becky.
-Good. Come here.

07:26.709 --> 07:30.208
[yells]
Easy on the lobes, lady.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.333
[Rebecca] Everything you have to do
is on the schedule.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.250
Just check off each item as you go.

07:39.333 --> 07:44.125
And while you're checking off,
I'll be checking up on you. Check?

07:44.208 --> 07:48.041
-Check. Huh?
-I'll be running some errands in the city.

07:48.125 --> 07:53.417
If I don't see this plane fly by
those places at these times,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.709
I'll check you off, buster!

07:57.083 --> 08:00.709
You land back at the dock
exactly at noon.

08:00.792 --> 08:04.917
And, Baloo, I want to see smiles
on the passengers' faces.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.709
No sweat, sweetheart.
Baloo'll leave them grinning.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.375
I'll follow your schedule to a T.

08:12.458 --> 08:16.208
If I didn't know better,
I'd say we're doing a tour.

08:16.291 --> 08:21.542
[Baloo] No, britches, you got it
all wrong. This is gonna be fun!

08:21.625 --> 08:27.250
Schedule! Noon! Here!
With smiles!

08:28.208 --> 08:31.583
Yeah, gobs of fun.
I can't wait.

08:31.667 --> 08:35.542
Hey, Baloo, look what I found
in number two engine, man.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.457
Wildcat, you did it!

08:39.375 --> 08:40.792
[laughs] All right!

08:40.875 --> 08:44.166
Hey, wha...
That's great, man.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.250
[laughs] What did I do?

08:46.333 --> 08:48.041
Mmm...

08:48.125 --> 08:52.542
Now, these goons said their goon boss
needed this good box by noon.

08:52.625 --> 08:55.291
Well, we still got time.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.500
We could get Becky's ten grand back.

08:57.583 --> 09:02.625
-Except we got a tour to finish by noon.
-Oh, yeah.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.458
Hmm, I guess I can't do
both at the same time.

09:06.542 --> 09:11.583
Oh, hey, no way, man.
You'd have to be at two places at once.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.667
Maybe not.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.583
All you gotta do is watch the clock,
and stick to the schedule,

09:18.667 --> 09:22.834
except you're gonna land early at one
minute to noon, instead of at noon.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.792
Now, I'll get back in the plane,

09:24.875 --> 09:28.125
and Rebecca will never know
that I didn't fly the tour.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.625
Hey, wha--
No, wait, slow down.

09:30.709 --> 09:36.041
-Uh, I'm flying the tour?
-Yes. Now repeat after me.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.709
-Follow the schedule.
-Follow the schedule.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.917
-Watch the clock.
-Watch the clock.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.083
-Land at the dock.
-Land at the dock.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.458
-Smiles.
-Smiles. And follow the schedule.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.500
By George, I he's got it.

09:48.583 --> 09:51.750
Eh, hello?
Ahoy there.

09:53.250 --> 09:57.458
One minute to 11, passengers arrive.

09:57.542 --> 10:01.250
[laughs] Hey, what do you know?
I'm getting the hang of this.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.500
Ta-ta, captain.

10:03.583 --> 10:08.125
A beautiful tour,
but Lester and I must be off.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.333
Off our rockers.

10:09.417 --> 10:14.291
One husband, check.
One wife, double check.

10:14.959 --> 10:20.625
Uh, good morning and welcome,
uh, aboard Higher for Hire tours,

10:20.875 --> 10:23.000
this is your captain speaking.

10:23.083 --> 10:27.208
We'll be taking off in...
Whoa, less than a minute!

10:27.291 --> 10:29.542
Better take your seats! Quick, go!

10:33.542 --> 10:38.583
-Are you sure this is a good idea?
-No, it's a great idea.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.542
Remember, smiles!

10:47.291 --> 10:51.458
-[plane engine starting]
-[Wildcat] Three, two, one.

10:53.542 --> 10:54.667
[woman] Yikes!

11:00.834 --> 11:04.000
[newsboy] Extree, extree!
Read all about it!

11:04.125 --> 11:08.542
Crunchy boar crown stolen!
Huge reward!

11:08.625 --> 11:11.875
-Paper, mister?
-No, maybe tomorrow.

11:11.959 --> 11:14.625
Oh, baby, it's gonna be too easy.

11:14.709 --> 11:18.000
Baloo, I have a funny feeling about this.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.333
Trust me, little britches.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.959
All we gotta do is deliver the box,
and get the bucks,

11:22.041 --> 11:24.750
and be back at Higher for Hire
before noon.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.667
Hey, don't I know you?

11:31.959 --> 11:34.667
My, my, solid as a rock.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.166
Up here, too.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.667
[laughs]
I take after my mother.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.208
Hey, wait a minute.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.917
You're the pilot who lost the box.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.333
Eureka! We've struck brains.

11:49.417 --> 11:54.083
Bingo, bright boy,
which is why we want to see your boss.

11:54.166 --> 11:58.125
Well, the boss said
he don't want to see nobody.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.458
Yeah, nobody.

11:59.542 --> 12:04.542
-And we do what the boss says.
-Yeah, we do... yeah.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.667
[crashes]

12:06.875 --> 12:12.291
Maybe we're too smart for those guys.
What we need is a stupid plan.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.959
Got a dime, partner?

12:14.041 --> 12:15.083
[alarm ringing]

12:16.125 --> 12:19.834
Oh, well, let's see what's next
on the schedule.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.333
A little more, a little more.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.041
-Ah, just right.
-[Wildcat] Lunchtime!

12:28.125 --> 12:32.333
-I have sandwiches. [chuckles]
-Sandwiches?

12:32.417 --> 12:34.959
What kind of sandwiches?

12:35.041 --> 12:37.500
Uh... oh.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.667
-Bologna.
-Oh!

12:41.750 --> 12:44.959
Hmm... Oh!
[laughs]

12:45.041 --> 12:48.291
Oops, wow. Where's my head?

12:50.166 --> 12:52.083
I forgot the potato salad.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.834
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

12:54.917 --> 12:56.875
[phone ringing]

12:56.959 --> 13:01.417
[Baloo] <i>Hello. Big, stupid goons?</i>
<i>The boss wants to see you.</i>

13:01.500 --> 13:04.375
The boss wants to see us.

13:05.458 --> 13:09.583
-Do you think he means now?
-Yeah! Now!

13:22.417 --> 13:25.333
[rushing up the stairs]

13:25.542 --> 13:29.250
[panting]
See? Nothing to it.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.041
I told you everything would work out.

13:36.083 --> 13:41.083
[alligator] You sponge heads!
For the last time, I didn't call yous.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.166
I got more important things to do.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.667
I got to deliver
a stolen crunchy boar crown by noon,

13:46.750 --> 13:50.166
only I ain't got one
'cause of some idiot pilot!

13:53.917 --> 13:55.917
-Oh, no.
-[rhino] Don't worry.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.333
We took care of that pilot.

13:58.375 --> 14:03.375
Yeah, every time he tried to get in,
we gave him the boot.

14:03.458 --> 14:07.333
Yeah. The boot.
Him and his box.

14:07.417 --> 14:12.166
He was here, with the box?
And you morons let him go?

14:12.250 --> 14:13.250
[grunting]

14:14.542 --> 14:15.709
It's them!

14:20.166 --> 14:22.959
We've got to stop meeting like this.

14:23.041 --> 14:25.542
[bells chime]

14:26.083 --> 14:28.458
[engine roaring]

14:29.792 --> 14:31.542
Eleven-thirty-one.

14:31.625 --> 14:36.208
Fly past the Savoir Faire restaurant.
Uh-oh.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.583
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.

14:40.667 --> 14:43.959
I would like to announce
that we will be going faster.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.542
[yelling]

14:50.083 --> 14:54.583
Eleven-thirty-one. Ten seconds, Baloo.
If you're not here...

14:55.083 --> 14:56.375
-Is that...?
-[airplane approaching]

14:56.458 --> 15:00.500
It is!
He actually followed the instructions.

15:05.125 --> 15:08.041
[alligator]
So, this is the idiot pilot.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.792
[laughs]
That's me. The idiot pilot.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.625
Here. Ten grand, like I promised.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.667
[laughs]
Gee, thanks.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.500
Well, will you look at the time?

15:29.583 --> 15:32.875
-We got to be going.
-Yeah. Love to stay and chat.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.750
Uh-uh-uh, ahem!

15:34.834 --> 15:36.667
Aren't you forgetting something?

15:38.458 --> 15:40.083
Silly me.

15:40.166 --> 15:44.000
By the way,
you didn't open that box, did you?

15:44.166 --> 15:48.667
What, and see the stolen crown inside?
Nah!

15:49.500 --> 15:51.750
Well, maybe just a peek.

15:55.458 --> 15:59.542
OK, boys. Ready... aim...

15:59.709 --> 16:02.041
About face! Fire!

16:03.875 --> 16:06.917
-Aw... sorry, boss.
-Yeah, sorry.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.792
-That was dumb.
-It was dumb.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.917
-We was just following orders.
-Yeah, orders.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.333
Shut up!
You don't listen to the kid. Got it?

16:15.417 --> 16:16.291
[both] Yep.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.542
Ready, aim, fire!

16:18.959 --> 16:22.959
Don't listen to the kid!
Don't listen to the pilot.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.458
Listen to me!

16:24.542 --> 16:27.417
When I say fire, you fire.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.583
Wait!

16:31.041 --> 16:32.583
[grunting]

16:32.834 --> 16:37.500
-But it was you this time.
-Yeah, yeah, you this time.

16:37.583 --> 16:40.583
Why, you two...
My box! After them!

16:44.500 --> 16:46.291
What's the plan, Papa Bear?

16:46.375 --> 16:49.291
We get back to the plane,
turn in the crown and get the reward.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.667
It's a good plan, huh?

16:50.750 --> 16:51.667
[banging]

17:01.083 --> 17:02.834
All right, find 'em!

17:04.290 --> 17:08.583
Oh. Don't worry, Kit.
They'll never think to look out here.

17:09.875 --> 17:13.625
[both]
Hey, boss! We found them!

17:13.709 --> 17:14.916
This way.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.125
We gotta get to the roof.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.959
Oh, no!
Look at the time!

17:34.792 --> 17:36.417
[yelling]

17:39.125 --> 17:41.375
Get the box!
Get the box!

17:41.458 --> 17:43.083
-I got it.
-No, I got it.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.125
-I got it.
-You got me.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500
[Kit]
Baloo!

17:47.667 --> 17:51.000
I'll strangle him, then I'll fire him.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.208
Then I'll strangle him again!

17:55.458 --> 18:00.417
Land now, you idiot,
so I can strangle you!

18:07.000 --> 18:08.750
[Wildcat]
Right on schedule.

18:08.834 --> 18:13.125
Boy, Miss Cunningham's
going to be happy to see this.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.291
After 'em!

18:14.375 --> 18:17.083
-Right, boss.
-Yeah, right.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.917
I got to get me some new goons.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.417
Hey, we got away.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.333
-[alligator] Get them!
-Yeah, yeah. But not far enough.

18:27.417 --> 18:30.917
[both]
Wait till I get my hands on that fat bear.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.834
[gunshots]

18:50.417 --> 18:55.458
[Wildcat] And this is Cape Heart,
recreational playground of our fair city.

18:55.667 --> 19:00.542
And over on the right...
Hey, guys! Hi! Hi!

19:00.625 --> 19:03.875
-It's Wildcat!
-We're saved!

19:03.959 --> 19:05.875
[both]
Wildcat!

19:05.959 --> 19:08.083
-[Baloo] Over here!
-Wildcat!

19:08.166 --> 19:11.667
Oh, no. Hee-hee!
Sorry, Baloo.

19:11.750 --> 19:16.875
I can't land until 11:59.
Got to stick to the schedule.

19:16.959 --> 19:22.208
I'll be back by 12:15 if you want.
OK? OK!

19:22.667 --> 19:25.959
The schedule!
Beautiful schedule!

19:26.041 --> 19:29.875
-Huh?
-Hey, short, squat, and ugly!

19:32.667 --> 19:34.250
[Kit] Baloo!

19:34.500 --> 19:38.291
Hey, Kit, trust me.
Old Papa Bear's got a plan.

19:38.375 --> 19:42.458
-First, we got to get them to chase us.
-Well, that part's working.

19:42.542 --> 19:46.500
-[Baloo] Then we gotta let them catch us.
-That's a plan?

19:46.583 --> 19:51.000
-Look, I'll just swim home.
-No, no. It'll work great.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.250
[both] Let us out!

19:52.333 --> 19:55.250
Is it too stuffy in here?

19:55.333 --> 19:58.083
-[both yelling]
-Oh, no. The schedule!

19:59.375 --> 20:01.291
It's stuck on the tail...

20:01.458 --> 20:03.166
[both yelling]

20:03.750 --> 20:07.625

-Baloo, are you sure about this?
-Got it figured to the second.

20:19.333 --> 20:22.583
Ah-ha! Gotcha!
Don't even think of moving.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.834
Who, us?
Nah. What's the use?

20:25.917 --> 20:30.417
You got us.
Man, our goose is cooked.

-We're going down--
-Will you shut up already?!

20:33.208 --> 20:36.417
-Now, hand over the box.
-Here it is.

20:38.709 --> 20:41.542
OK, now, when I say fire...

[Wildcat laughs]
11:59 on the dot.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.583
Hi, guys. Did I do OK?

21:04.667 --> 21:06.166
Right on the button.

Aw, sorry, boss.

-Becky! Just in time.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.709
Here's your money, honey.
And I believe this is yours, too.

21:19.792 --> 21:20.875
But... but how?

21:20.959 --> 21:23.333
Oops! Excuse me, will ya?

21:23.417 --> 21:27.667
And for you, one crown
and a soggy gang of thieves,

21:30.208 --> 21:34.542
Good work. Guess there's no doubt
about who gets the reward.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.250
Nope.
Rebecca!

21:37.333 --> 21:42.542
This just about ought to cover the damage
you caused on your little joyriding tour,

21:42.625 --> 21:45.667
which I hope had a happy ending.

Take a gander... smiles.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.208
I don't know how you did it, Baloo,

21:53.291 --> 21:57.500
but one of these days, I'll figure out
what really happened and when I do--

21:57.583 --> 21:58.458
