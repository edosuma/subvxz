00:00.288 --> 00:01.821
Previously on The Fosters:

00:01.839 --> 00:03.540
Nice effort.

00:03.574 --> 00:04.624
Everybody knows I went to rehab.

00:04.659 --> 00:05.792
They don't know that you were my dealer.

00:05.843 --> 00:08.612
- You're selling my pills?
- Where'd you get the drugs?

00:08.646 --> 00:11.748
- It was me. I did it.
- You could have gotten me arrested for shoplifting.

00:11.782 --> 00:15.385
- Mariana, you're a genius.
- She ran away because I kissed her.

00:15.419 --> 00:18.688
We feel she deserves a second chance,
but we are not prepared to bring her

00:18.723 --> 00:20.657
back into our home at this time.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.559
She's gonna think you're giving up on her!

00:22.593 --> 00:23.894
I ran away, I don't belong here.

00:23.928 --> 00:25.795
- You know me, right?
- Wanna take another crack at my face?

00:25.830 --> 00:28.665
I need to see my little brother.
He needs to know why I left.

00:28.699 --> 00:32.435
You don't get to just act out and
then run away from the consequences.

00:32.470 --> 00:35.471
Not in this house. In
fact, not anywhere in life.

00:43.814 --> 00:46.666
With all the strings we pulled to
get Callie into that group home,

00:46.701 --> 00:49.719
you didn't think maybe you should've
told me she was involved with your son?

00:49.754 --> 00:52.672
We spoke to Brandon, and we
thought we had this under control.

00:52.707 --> 00:54.908
If you want Callie's
program to work for her,

00:54.909 --> 00:57.406
she can't be dealing with this stuff.

00:58.562 --> 01:01.498
If Brandon shows up again, Callie's out.

01:01.532 --> 01:03.533
We agree with you, 100
percent. That's why you're here.

01:03.567 --> 01:06.669
I just hope he takes
you seriously this time.

01:06.687 --> 01:09.639
- Thank you. So do we.
- Morning.

01:09.674 --> 01:12.475
Morning, Judeicorn.

01:12.510 --> 01:15.512
- What?
- Judeicorn? Really?

01:15.546 --> 01:17.852
Are you hungry? I can make you something.

01:17.853 --> 01:20.049
Waffles? French toast?

01:25.690 --> 01:29.426
Who is that? Is that a social worker?

01:29.460 --> 01:34.698
No. It's, um... I think it's
Callie's probation officer.

01:34.732 --> 01:38.735
But I'm sure everything's gonna be ok.

01:43.507 --> 01:45.709
Apparently, we have some
sort of misunderstanding.

01:45.743 --> 01:49.779
Just because there are no locks on
the doors or bars on the windows,

01:49.814 --> 01:52.716
that doesn't mean you can run out
of the house whenever you please

01:52.750 --> 01:54.584
- just to go see your boyfriend.
- He's not my...

01:54.618 --> 01:57.520
Well, whoever he is, zero contact.

01:59.724 --> 02:01.391
You have anything to say?

02:03.627 --> 02:05.662
- I'm sorry?
- Is that a question?

02:05.696 --> 02:08.832
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

02:08.866 --> 02:12.369
And there'll be no more accidents
with Cole, or with anyone else.

02:12.403 --> 02:15.705
I have really had it,
Callie. No more passes.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.508
Look at me.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.543
- You got it?
- Got it.

02:20.578 --> 02:23.480
Good. You can go.

02:25.683 --> 02:27.517
Dad.

02:29.470 --> 02:32.689
Come here.

02:32.723 --> 02:34.557
Callie's probation officer just left.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.462
Listen, I just wanted to
make sure Callie was ok,

02:39.497 --> 02:42.465
- just see for myself.
- After we expressly forbid it?

02:42.500 --> 02:43.767
We have the right to see each other.

02:43.801 --> 02:46.636
No, you don't have the right
to interfere with her probation.

02:46.670 --> 02:50.607
- Well, you can't stop us.
- Actually, we can.

02:54.745 --> 02:58.415
- What's this?
- A restraining order, Brandon.

02:58.449 --> 03:02.719
If you go within 100 feet of
Callie again, you'll be arrested.

03:45.663 --> 03:50.433
- This is such bull!
- Brandon, we know that you care about Callie,

03:50.468 --> 03:52.668
and that given the choice you
might feel obligated to see her.

03:52.686 --> 03:54.838
This restraining order,
it takes it off the table.

03:54.872 --> 03:57.474
- B, we're just trying to protect you both.
- Whatever.

03:57.508 --> 04:02.445
It's completely insane.

04:05.683 --> 04:07.817
Well, that went about
as well as expected, huh?

04:07.852 --> 04:10.653
This, I mean... are we
doing the right thing?

04:10.688 --> 04:12.755
We can't have a 24-hour tail on him.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.824
Once he calms down and gets over himself,

04:14.859 --> 04:18.628
he'll realize this is
what's best for Callie.

04:18.661 --> 04:21.363
I gotta go.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.668
First day back, already? How ya feeling?

04:25.702 --> 04:28.805
Honestly? A little guilty.
You should be coming with me.

04:28.839 --> 04:33.843
Don't feel bad. I'm fine. This
is all gonna work itself out.

04:33.878 --> 04:34.715
Ok?

04:34.716 --> 04:38.591
Besides, you don't want me to go back
before I finish the engine, do you?

04:38.592 --> 04:39.849
He has a point.

04:39.883 --> 04:42.927
Mike, thank you for
working on my car and for,

04:42.928 --> 04:44.581
you know, just being here.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.789
- If there's anything you need...
- Just coffee.

04:46.824 --> 04:48.558
I'll get it myself.

04:51.729 --> 04:53.563
Brandon will get over it.

04:53.581 --> 04:55.565
I'm just worried about Callie.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.535
How do we know she's not sitting
there thinking Brandon is the only one

04:58.569 --> 05:02.572
who hasn't given up on her? It's just hard.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.340
That's why it's called tough love.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.509
Yeah?

05:06.544 --> 05:09.479
Well, I forgot how tough
you looked in uniform.

05:09.513 --> 05:12.348
You see?

05:16.854 --> 05:19.589
Call me at lunch, let me
know how things are going?

05:19.623 --> 05:23.393
- Absolutely. I love you.
- Love you.

05:28.566 --> 05:31.484
This is such crap.

05:31.535 --> 05:33.786
Hey, you're lucky hosing off cans is
all you got for running out of the house

05:33.821 --> 05:35.672
to get a little somethin'
somethin' from your boy.

05:35.706 --> 05:39.542
- All I got was
a hug. - Uh-huh.

05:39.577 --> 05:42.445
Look, hurry it up. The van's picking
us up in ten for the field trip.

05:42.479 --> 05:47.450
- Uh, I lost my privileges.
- It ain't a privilege.

06:31.257 --> 06:36.144
Hey! You coming in on my turf?

06:36.195 --> 06:40.065
- First wrestling, now my beach?
- Oh. This is your beach?

06:40.099 --> 06:43.151
I'm here every morning,
first time I've seen you.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.304
Well, running is part of
this new thing that I'm doing.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.340
What, coach has you on some special plan?

06:48.374 --> 06:54.329
- Nah, that's not it.
- Then what? Getting ready for swimsuit season?

06:54.380 --> 07:00.152
- Well?
- Um, I just got off my ADHD meds, ok?

07:00.186 --> 07:03.288
Well, that's cool, you
know, doing it on your own.

07:03.306 --> 07:06.959
Wrestling's part of it,
supposed to help me focus.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.395
- How's it going?
- It's been pretty good so far.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.265
Except I can't eat any processed foods.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.968
And I can't have anything with dye.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.036
Do you know what has dye in it?

07:18.071 --> 07:21.239
- Just about everything that tastes good.
- Not everything.

07:22.408 --> 07:26.144
Come on, I'll race you to school.

07:26.162 --> 07:30.115
I gotta be honest, I've
never had a female partner.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.019
- Is that so?
- Don't get me wrong, I'm... I'm fine with it.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.990
I appreciate the situation,
getting shot and all,

07:38.024 --> 07:40.125
but no partner of mine
has ever taken a bullet.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.428
Anything else I should know?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.331
I drive.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.338
Captain Roberts, do you have a sec?

07:53.356 --> 07:56.174
Yeah.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.279
How's the investigation's going?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.115
Any word on Mike, when he's coming back?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.351
Officially? Uh, no word yet.

08:06.386 --> 08:11.256
- And unofficially?
- Between us, IA's clearing him soon.

08:11.290 --> 08:15.994
Good. There is one other thing. Um...

08:16.029 --> 08:20.098
You don't really expect me to work
with that sexist dinosaur, do you?

08:20.133 --> 08:23.135
- Yes, I...
- That's what I thought. Ok.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.170
- Thank you very much.
- All right. Get to work.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.174
- Don't hate me!
- Finally.

08:29.208 --> 08:33.979
So, so sorry. I got in a Twitter war
with some chick from Mission High.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.215
She said our soccer team looked like
it was made up of actual blue whales.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.184
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

08:40.219 --> 08:43.221
So I told her she was a skank and everyone
in town hooked up with her boyfriend.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.357
- Did they?
- No.

08:45.391 --> 08:49.077
Duh. Ok, here, finish him so I can eat?

08:49.112 --> 08:52.364
- And his shirt's a little loose.
- Done.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.268
Mariana, can you come here for a sec?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.253
Yes.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.372
Do you think my pants are too short?

09:00.406 --> 09:03.241
Um, just a tad.

09:03.259 --> 09:06.344
But I can take the hem
out and re-pin them.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.097
Great, thanks.

09:12.285 --> 09:16.021
Um, I will get into
your pants after school.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.191
I mean, I will get into hemming them.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.360
Hey, can you maybe do me
another favor after school?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.963
I'm not off book yet.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.932
Um, could you maybe run lines with me?

09:27.950 --> 09:31.303
Um... sure.

09:38.327 --> 09:42.047
The movie at the planetarium.
It opens in a couple weeks.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.282
3D, asteroids and meteors and stuff.

09:44.300 --> 09:48.136
- Sounds cool, right?
- Yeah, but I don't know.

09:48.171 --> 09:53.992
- What? Why?
- I just don't know if I'm gonna be around then, is all.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.145
- Are you gonna eat that?
- No, here.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.131
Well, if you are around, you gotta come.

10:00.149 --> 10:04.069
I heard it's so real it feels like
stuff's exploding all around you.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.251
Hey, it's Stef. I'm either
working or avoiding your call.

10:19.285 --> 10:23.421
- So good luck.
- Hey, it's me, I was just checking in.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.458
Um, my lunch is almost
over and I have a meeting,

10:26.492 --> 10:31.463
but... call if you get this
in the next few minutes. Ok?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.300
I love you. Bye.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.170
Sorry. Um, the Kindle
Paperwhite e-readers are here.

10:39.188 --> 10:43.241
Oh, wow! Oh, my goodness. It must
be nice to be a student these days.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.378
- Right?
- Thank God for grants.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.181
- Wow, it's so light.
- And the cool thing is,

10:49.215 --> 10:51.449
now the kids can read their
assignments, add margin notes,

10:51.484 --> 10:55.353
- and export them to their computers.
- Wow. Fancy.

10:55.388 --> 10:59.157
- Can I have one?
- They're for the children.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.359
I was just kidding.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.027
You ok?

11:05.264 --> 11:07.966
Yeah. It's, um...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.268
Stef's first day back to work.

11:10.303 --> 11:15.340
Yeah. But I'm fine.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.211
I stood up in front of all
our friends and family and...

11:19.245 --> 11:22.447
I said I would be fine, so yeah.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.417
- I'm ok.
- Ok.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.124
It keeps sticking.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.360
What do you expect? It's,
like, a thousand years old.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.398
Great, now I have to hand sew everything.

11:40.416 --> 11:43.285
- Goodbye, sleep.
- I'll fix it.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.337
Probably not today, but...

11:45.371 --> 11:49.274
You're a tech wizard, you
can't just make it work?

11:49.308 --> 11:52.277
Yeah, I'll get right on top of that, Rose.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.280
Ok, you did not just say
that. You know that movie?

11:55.314 --> 11:58.149
Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead?

11:58.184 --> 12:00.385
- It's a classic.
- I love old movies!

12:00.419 --> 12:02.172
Lexi and I watched it like a million times.

12:02.175 --> 12:03.164
When we were little,

12:03.165 --> 12:07.099
we used to think that watching
PG-13 movies was so dangerous.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.961
We were such dorks.

12:09.996 --> 12:13.264
- My favorite part is the grunion run.
- I know, right?

12:13.282 --> 12:16.318
- I've always wanted to do that.
- Me too. It's so cool.

12:16.369 --> 12:20.121
Here. Rejects.

12:20.156 --> 12:25.143
- Ok... what's wrong?
- Uh... I gotta go.

12:28.447 --> 12:32.133
You even have to ask?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.020
- Obviously.
- You knew I liked Chase.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.368
- What?
- Running lines?

12:36.369 --> 12:37.985
Everybody knows that's code for hooking up.

12:38.291 --> 12:42.327
- It is?
- God, are you even listening?

12:42.361 --> 12:45.230
What? Chase asked me. I
wasn't going after him.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.166
I was just doing my job,
alone, thanks to you.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.101
Oh, so forget me, right?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.237
Just like when I covered for your
ass when you were dealing drugs,

12:52.271 --> 12:55.473
and then you dumped me as a thank you?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.342
I thought you were sorry about all that.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.250
A fly orchid's petals look like flies,

13:05.284 --> 13:07.285
and it actually mimics pheromones,

13:07.319 --> 13:10.038
which attract hordes of male insects.

13:10.089 --> 13:13.258
An insect will land on the
flower and try to mate with it,

13:13.292 --> 13:15.994
with, of course, no success.

13:16.012 --> 13:19.014
The system by which we call
this is sexual deception.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.967
Sounds like a date with Gabi.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.269
- I don't need to trick anybody.
- We're out of the house,

13:24.303 --> 13:26.137
can we act like we have some sense?

13:26.171 --> 13:28.173
- At least I don't need to beg for it.
- Ok, enough.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.442
Please, can we get another line of jokes?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.302
You think that's a joke?

13:34.303 --> 13:37.352
To make a sexual innuendo is not a joke.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.971
Excuse me, miss. Would you
like to see my bonsai tree?

14:06.228 --> 14:09.147
Our ponds have three types of koi:

14:09.181 --> 14:12.400
butterfly, dragon and ghost.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.939
I think it's beautiful. Truly.

14:19.358 --> 14:24.946
- Where's Callie? Did you see Callie?
- I don't know.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.365
Ok, go on. I will meet you there.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.070
Callie?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.072
Why didn't you just text me?!

14:34.090 --> 14:35.406
I wanted to tell you in person.

14:35.424 --> 14:37.175
God, Brandon, you can't be
here. What if you get arrested?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.077
So, what, you're the only
one who can take risks?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.379
No, not what I'm saying.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.014
We have to be smart about this.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.016
Callie!

14:47.136 --> 14:49.137
Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.391
Sorry.

14:58.030 --> 14:58.947
Crap.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.299
I just want to help. Ok?

15:01.333 --> 15:04.069
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah, to get out of that house.

15:04.103 --> 15:08.990
What about getting emancipated?
Kids do that, right?

15:09.041 --> 15:12.410
Yeah, if I had a million
dollars for a lawyer.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.997
You should go. Someone's
gonna notice you're gone.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.415
Wait, um...

15:17.449 --> 15:22.420
- How's Jude?
- He's ok.

15:22.455 --> 15:26.357
- He hates me, doesn't he?
- No, he doesn't hate you.

15:28.027 --> 15:28.977
He misses you.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.098
I miss you.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.403
Go. Now! Get out of here!

15:40.322 --> 15:42.157
You wanna get bounced back to juvie?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.993
Hey, where have you been?

15:45.027 --> 15:49.280
- Um, sorry, I...
- Got lost looking for the bathrooms.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.332
You know you're not supposed
to separate from the group.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.285
Yeah, I know, it's my fault. Um...

15:54.319 --> 15:57.288
I just didn't want to interrupt the
tour. Sorry. It won't happen again.

15:57.322 --> 16:00.925
Yeah. It won't. Let's go.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.295
Now we're straight.

16:13.045 --> 16:16.214
So are you just gonna ignore
me for the rest of the day?

16:16.249 --> 16:20.252
- Maybe.
- Look, I'm sorry about Chase.

16:20.286 --> 16:23.321
Seriously, if I thought it
was gonna cause all this drama,

16:23.356 --> 16:27.175
I never would've agreed
to run lines with him.

16:27.226 --> 16:30.095
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

16:30.129 --> 16:32.180
I mean, I won't do it
if it really bothers you.

16:32.231 --> 16:34.900
Good, 'cause I'm totally sorry too.

16:34.934 --> 16:37.302
We're just becoming friends again, and
we're letting a boy come between us?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.971
Hells, no. We are not those girls.

16:39.989 --> 16:44.075
- Hey, Chase.
- Um, one sec.

16:44.110 --> 16:47.329
- Hey, Chase?
- Hey.

16:47.363 --> 16:50.365
I'm so sorry, but, um,

16:50.416 --> 16:54.085
with all the alterations and
stuff, I'm sorta swamped, so...

16:54.120 --> 16:56.221
I can't run lines with you after school.

16:56.255 --> 16:58.957
Well, that kinda sucks.

16:58.991 --> 17:02.160
But I'm free. I'd love
to run lines with you.

17:02.178 --> 17:04.262
Cool.

17:11.103 --> 17:13.939
Excuse me, this is the
line for the boy's bathroom.

17:13.973 --> 17:16.340
- I know.
- I'm sorry, but you can't sneak in because it's shorter.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.175
It's confusing to the younger students.

17:18.194 --> 17:21.029
You're the only one confused
here. Mind your business.

17:21.063 --> 17:23.198
- Cole, just get over here.
- Is there a problem?

17:23.232 --> 17:25.349
She's in the wrong line, that's
all I was telling her, and she...

17:25.367 --> 17:28.870
Why can't you understand that using
the other bathroom is confusing for me?

17:28.905 --> 17:30.322
If you don't calm down, we'll escort you...

17:30.356 --> 17:33.024
State law says I have the right
to use any public bathroom I want.

17:33.059 --> 17:35.076
- And this is a public museum!
- That's enough.

17:35.127 --> 17:37.913
- Don't put hands on me!
- Stay in your lane, freak!

17:37.964 --> 17:39.047
- What did you call me?!
- What did you say?!

17:39.081 --> 17:41.199
- I said, back off!
- Don't touch her!

17:41.217 --> 17:43.919
Stop, get off!

17:43.970 --> 17:48.173
Back away! Walk away, girls! You walk away!

17:54.313 --> 17:58.233
Social Services will transport you to
juvenile hall, and there you will be...

17:58.267 --> 18:00.318
I'll be sentenced. Yep. Got it.

18:00.353 --> 18:06.324
- You been through this before?
- How many times?

18:06.359 --> 18:10.228
- Four.
- What are we gonna do with you?

18:10.263 --> 18:13.949
- We will have the report sent to his PO.
- Thanks.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.067
Come on, let's go.

18:16.085 --> 18:18.203
Easy, easy, easy.

18:20.957 --> 18:23.008
- Ok.
- Let's go.

18:24.010 --> 18:26.077
Four times.

18:26.095 --> 18:27.879
It seems like a waste to
send him back to juvie.

18:27.913 --> 18:30.215
Yeah, once they're in
the system, lost cause.

18:30.249 --> 18:33.268
And the older you get them, the
harder it is to straighten them out.

18:33.302 --> 18:36.021
I don't know about that.

18:36.055 --> 18:38.890
Not if someone fights for them.

18:38.924 --> 18:41.359
All these kids really want to
know is that somebody loves them.

18:41.394 --> 18:43.928
The problem is nobody does.

18:48.951 --> 18:53.238
As we continue this semester's analysis
of The Great Gatsby, we dive into...

18:53.272 --> 18:55.106
What the hell was that?

18:55.124 --> 18:56.958
We said we weren't going to
let a boy come between us.

18:56.993 --> 19:00.912
- We aren't.
- I thought that meant neither of us was going after Chase.

19:00.946 --> 19:03.048
Sorry, what do you want me to do?

19:03.082 --> 19:05.000
Nothing. It's fine.

19:05.051 --> 19:08.837
Uh-uh! Not so fast.

19:08.888 --> 19:13.291
Your homework is to write 1,000
words answering this question:

19:13.326 --> 19:16.061
Does Gatsby love Daisy,

19:16.095 --> 19:19.848
or does he love the
lifestyle she represents?

19:19.899 --> 19:22.183
Uh, Kelsey, where do
you think you're going?

19:22.234 --> 19:25.987
- Play practice.
- You got your third tardy this period.

19:26.022 --> 19:29.024
- You're with me, detention.
- No, can't I stay tomorrow?

19:29.075 --> 19:31.943
- I have to work on costumes for the play.
- That's too bad.

19:31.977 --> 19:35.997
And you know the rules.

19:36.032 --> 19:38.033
No phones.

19:38.084 --> 19:41.286
Mariana, tell Chase I can't make it, ok?

19:47.176 --> 19:50.879
He doesn't stand a chance.
Ryan's got 30 pounds on him.

19:50.930 --> 19:54.182
- It's good practice.
- Save the gossip, girls, I'm trying to watch the match.

19:57.019 --> 20:00.972
Ryan wins it. Foster, time to circle-up.

20:01.006 --> 20:04.976
- You and Vico, let's go.
- Ankle pick, and go for the knee.

20:05.010 --> 20:07.278
Don't worry. You've got this.

20:09.031 --> 20:11.316
Let's do this, gentlemen.

20:16.205 --> 20:18.156
Set!

20:21.410 --> 20:25.130
You got this! Come on!
Go, go, go! Go, Foster!

20:25.164 --> 20:27.248
Go for it!

20:27.299 --> 20:31.369
You got it, Foster!

20:31.387 --> 20:36.091
Match to Vico.

20:39.044 --> 20:41.096
Hey. Nice job.

20:41.147 --> 20:44.099
He's way out of your weight class,
you held your own. Keep it up.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.217
Ok...

20:46.252 --> 20:48.386
- Hey, Lena.
- Hey. What's up?

20:48.421 --> 20:52.190
Um, listen, I don't want you to worry,

20:52.224 --> 20:57.295
but just in case you hear something,
there was a police chase and, um...

20:57.329 --> 20:57.990
What?

20:57.991 --> 21:02.824
It just ended downtown and
apparently shots were fired.

21:03.302 --> 21:06.237
Listen, I'm sure Stef wasn't involved,

21:06.272 --> 21:08.206
I just didn't want you to worry about...

21:08.240 --> 21:12.944
Oh. It's fine. Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.

21:12.978 --> 21:14.179
All right.

21:24.306 --> 21:26.924
Hey, it's Stef. I'm either
working or avoiding your call.

21:26.942 --> 21:29.093
- So good luck.

21:33.949 --> 21:37.101
Hey, B. Give your old man a hand, will ya?

21:37.119 --> 21:39.370
- Homework.
- Hey!

21:41.173 --> 21:43.107
Hold on a second.

21:46.245 --> 21:48.980
- Look, I know you're angry.
- Oh, yeah? You think?

21:49.014 --> 21:52.217
How about I get a restraining
order between you and your car keys.

21:52.251 --> 21:56.187
Ok. All right.

21:56.222 --> 22:01.125
Look, I'm sorry I got too drunk at the
quinceañera, and you had to drive me home.

22:01.160 --> 22:06.197
Ok? I'm sure that was really
hard for you to see me like that.

22:06.232 --> 22:09.334
And your audition with Marshall, I
was hungover, and I made you late.

22:09.368 --> 22:14.205
- I'm sorry for that, too.
- Mariana's birthday, and some stupid audition?

22:14.240 --> 22:18.076
Really? Are you trying to
make amends? Is that it?

22:18.110 --> 22:21.112
- Brandon...
- How about when I was six,

22:21.146 --> 22:24.315
and you nearly drove off the
road, drunk, with me in the car?

22:24.350 --> 22:29.220
Or after the divorce, you want on that
bender, I didn't see you for a month.

22:29.255 --> 22:32.323
Brandon, I never drank around
you when you were little.

22:32.358 --> 22:34.058
Oh, right, yeah, so I'm making that up.

22:34.093 --> 22:37.328
No, I'm not saying you're making
it up, ok? I just don't remember.

22:37.363 --> 22:41.232
Yeah, you can't remember.

22:41.267 --> 22:44.052
That's the thing about being a drunk:

22:44.103 --> 22:47.405
you get to forget what
the rest of us can't.

23:06.407 --> 23:11.077
- Um, I got the pedal working.
- Great. Thanks.

23:14.381 --> 23:17.350
- Where's your partner?
- Detention.

23:17.384 --> 23:20.236
Figures.

23:20.271 --> 23:21.557
You guys are supposed to be a team,

23:21.558 --> 23:23.636
you do all the work,
she takes all the credit.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.527
Kelsey's just, I don't
know, bigger than life.

23:27.561 --> 23:29.429
And you're what, invisible?

23:33.334 --> 23:35.502
I gotta get some more gobos from
the drama classroom, need anything?

23:35.536 --> 23:38.571
Nope, I've got everything I need.

23:50.618 --> 23:54.387
Hey. Um... where's Kelsey?

23:54.421 --> 23:59.192
Uh, yeah, turns out she
couldn't make it after all.

23:59.226 --> 24:05.198
But I still have a few days
to finish the costumes, so...

24:05.232 --> 24:07.367
I mean, if you're still interested.

24:17.545 --> 24:21.514
- What's this for?
- You really gave Vico a run for his money.

24:21.549 --> 24:24.350
I figured you deserved a cookie.

24:24.385 --> 24:29.389
- Like a dog?
- It's organic, jerk, no dyes.

24:29.423 --> 24:32.225
I'm giving you props, you held your own.

24:32.259 --> 24:34.394
Yeah, for about three seconds.

24:34.428 --> 24:37.530
You've gotta learn to accept praise.

24:39.300 --> 24:43.469
So... do you want to run with me tomorrow?

24:43.504 --> 24:47.190
- Whoa, I've got a girlfriend.
- And a giant ego.

24:47.241 --> 24:51.444
Hey, newbie, time for your tunnel of love!

24:51.478 --> 24:54.314
- He's talking to you.
- Me?

24:54.348 --> 24:58.251
- It's just an initiation thing.
- Sounds kinky, and sorta scary.

24:58.285 --> 25:00.486
Don't be a wuss. I did it.

25:00.504 --> 25:05.225
Just run through the tunnel
and accept our praise.

25:33.404 --> 25:36.072
- Stef.
- I'm so sorry that I didn't call.

25:36.123 --> 25:39.392
I left my stupid cell
phone here at the station.

25:39.426 --> 25:42.295
- Oh.
- Is everything all right?

25:44.198 --> 25:46.532
Yeah, yes. I'm fine.

25:46.567 --> 25:51.203
I was just... I was wondering about dinner.

25:51.222 --> 25:55.308
- Is pasta ok?
- Um... yeah, sounds good.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.279
- See you in a bit.
- All right. I love you, babe.

26:04.518 --> 26:08.087
- What happened?
- Nothing.

26:08.122 --> 26:09.489
- Mom, don't...
- What the hell happened to my son?

26:09.523 --> 26:12.158
- What are you talking about?
- This!

26:12.192 --> 26:15.128
Anchor Beach has zero tolerance for hazing,

26:15.162 --> 26:16.329
or whatever this "circle of punching" is!

26:16.363 --> 26:18.081
- Tunnel of Love.
- Shut up.

26:18.115 --> 26:20.466
Come on, it's just a rite of
passage for new team members.

26:20.501 --> 26:22.435
I guess we got a little
outta hand with that.

26:22.469 --> 26:25.138
I'll talk to the guys, ok?

26:25.172 --> 26:27.507
I don't know what you think we're
running here, but this is not fight club.

26:27.541 --> 26:29.375
This is a school. We're
not turning a blind eye!

26:29.410 --> 26:33.413
So this rite of passage, it
ends now, or your job does.

26:33.447 --> 26:38.151
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:45.359 --> 26:48.528
I could put on an act for you, Laura,

26:48.562 --> 26:53.366
and say lots of things
without being very sincere.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.369
But I don't...

26:56.403 --> 27:00.039
I...

27:00.074 --> 27:01.474
Damn, I always screw this part up. Line?

27:01.508 --> 27:05.211
"Um, but this time, I am.

27:05.245 --> 27:06.479
I'm talking to you sincerely."

27:06.513 --> 27:11.217
But this time, I am.

27:11.251 --> 27:15.338
I'm talking to you sincerely.

27:15.389 --> 27:20.126
I happened to notice you
had this inferiority complex

27:20.144 --> 27:25.465
that keeps you from feeling
comfortable with people.

27:25.499 --> 27:29.469
Someone needs to build your confidence up

27:29.503 --> 27:35.208
and make you proud instead of
shy and turning away and blushing.

27:37.478 --> 27:40.079
Someone ought to...

27:41.281 --> 27:43.383
ought to kiss you, Laura.

28:18.220 --> 28:21.022
Stop tripping! You need
to get over yourself, Cole!

28:21.056 --> 28:22.888
Why can't you just do
what you're supposed to do?

28:22.889 --> 28:24.250
We only got a few hours of freedom.

28:24.519 --> 28:28.406
- We had to leave early because of your ass.
- I have rights.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.259
We looked that law up, it
only applies in schools.

28:31.293 --> 28:34.361
It was a field trip during school
hours, I should have the right!

28:34.379 --> 28:37.598
But you don't, so until you do,
stop throwing your "trantrums."

28:37.633 --> 28:40.701
Hey, Gabi, can you express
yourself to Cole calmly?

28:40.736 --> 28:45.256
- I think Cole makes things hard on herself.
- What's that supposed to mean?

28:45.307 --> 28:48.643
I think you're an angry person,
and I think the only thing

28:48.677 --> 28:51.562
that's going to change when you
go through your little transition

28:51.597 --> 28:55.650
is that you're going to be
an angry person with a penis!

28:55.684 --> 28:57.585
Gabi.

28:57.619 --> 29:01.455
- At least I know who I am.
- Girl, please.

29:01.490 --> 29:05.426
- Don't call me "girl!"
- Everybody should know by now,

29:05.460 --> 29:07.662
refer to Cole as "he." All right?

29:07.696 --> 29:10.364
Callie, you haven't said anything.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.536
- I think Cole's right.
- What?

29:15.570 --> 29:19.540
Yeah. You just want him
to do what's easy for you.

29:19.574 --> 29:23.260
But sometimes what's right isn't easy.

29:23.295 --> 29:27.214
- What are you, Jesus Christ?
- No, for real.

29:27.249 --> 29:28.247
No, I'm serious.

29:28.948 --> 29:31.932
You say you think Cole
makes things hard on himself,

29:31.933 --> 29:34.422
but what you actually mean is
he makes things hard on you.

29:34.456 --> 29:37.325
So maybe you should stop thinking
about yourself all the time,

29:37.359 --> 29:41.629
- and cut Cole a little slack.
- I think that was very well said, Callie.

29:41.663 --> 29:45.333
- Whatever, I'm over it.
- Yeah, seriously.

29:49.287 --> 29:53.307
What's his problem?

29:53.342 --> 29:57.411
He got a little roughed up at practice,
and I had to have a talk with his coach.

29:57.446 --> 29:59.447
- In front of everyone!
- Mom.

29:59.481 --> 30:01.582
We can't have students
pummeling each other.

30:01.616 --> 30:04.285
You're not just the
vice principal, you know,

30:04.319 --> 30:06.620
it's not that easy hearing people
call you "Meana Lena" all the time.

30:08.590 --> 30:10.624
Ants!

30:10.659 --> 30:14.311
- Ants?
- Right there.

30:32.647 --> 30:36.317
- Can I help you?
- Hi. Are you Rita?

30:36.351 --> 30:39.353
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Stef Foster.

30:39.388 --> 30:43.491
Callie Jacob's foster
mom, one of them. I, um...

30:43.525 --> 30:47.628
- I spoke to you on the phone.
- Yeah, of course.

30:47.662 --> 30:51.699
- Is everything ok?
- Oh, yeah, no, I'm not here on official business.

30:51.733 --> 30:55.503
I was driving home from work
and I thought I'd stop in,

30:55.537 --> 30:57.571
you know, see how she's doing.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.540
- She's fine.
- She's good?

30:59.574 --> 31:02.643
- Yeah.
- That's good.

31:02.677 --> 31:07.515
I, um... I don't suppose there's any
chance I could just say hi to her?

31:07.549 --> 31:09.383
Stef?

31:09.418 --> 31:12.553
Yeah. Um, Callie actually
doesn't have her privileges,

31:12.587 --> 31:15.589
but even if she did, you
can't just show up unannounced.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.395
I just, uh...

31:21.430 --> 31:26.367
Last time we saw her was
in the courtroom and it...

31:26.401 --> 31:30.438
Uh... I just don't want her
to think that we don't care.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.574
Yeah, I don't think she thinks that.

31:33.608 --> 31:39.413
And if you don't mind a little
advice, let her come to you.

31:39.448 --> 31:41.449
Don't worry. She's in good hands.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.520
- Good, thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:46.555 --> 31:49.556
- Ok.
- Maybe we'll see you at the next Family Day?

31:49.574 --> 31:51.358
- Yeah. For sure.
- Ok?

31:51.393 --> 31:53.360
- Have a good one.
- You too.

32:21.712 --> 32:27.417
We have a stocked pantry, and you
can help yourself anytime you want.

32:27.451 --> 32:32.689
- Are you worried that we're going to run out?
- No. It's just,

32:32.723 --> 32:37.494
sometimes foster homes
don't have a lot of food.

32:37.528 --> 32:41.731
Or they, you know, they
keep track of what we eat.

32:43.834 --> 32:48.672
Are you afraid someone's going
to come and take you from us?

32:48.706 --> 32:51.374
That's kinda how it goes.

32:51.409 --> 32:57.347
Callie does something, case
workers show up, we get moved.

32:57.381 --> 32:59.716
Oh, my goodness.

33:03.688 --> 33:06.656
I know how scary it is,

33:06.691 --> 33:11.461
feeling like the rug could be pulled
out from under you at any minute.

33:11.495 --> 33:14.564
- You do?
- Sure, I do.

33:14.599 --> 33:19.402
I felt that way when I got the
call that Stef had been shot,

33:19.437 --> 33:22.339
and I imagine it felt the way
for you when Callie ran away.

33:24.575 --> 33:27.744
Jude, I can't promise you that
there won't be any surprises.

33:27.778 --> 33:31.615
Life is unpredictable.

33:31.649 --> 33:35.318
But you can't live your life

33:35.353 --> 33:37.687
in fear of what might happen.

33:40.491 --> 33:43.693
The one thing that I know for sure

33:43.728 --> 33:47.464
is that you are safe in this house,

33:47.498 --> 33:50.567
and we won't pull the
rug out from under you.

33:53.504 --> 33:55.422
It's ok.

33:55.456 --> 33:59.409
Whatever it is, we'll take care of it.

33:59.427 --> 34:02.295
I mean, I thought she changed,

34:02.346 --> 34:04.514
and I hate to narc,

34:04.548 --> 34:08.717
but we were doing some shopping for
the play, and she stole something.

34:09.754 --> 34:12.589
I'm really worried about her.

34:12.623 --> 34:17.694
So... I just, I have to come clean.

34:17.728 --> 34:22.299
Um... Jesus didn't give me his pills.

34:23.534 --> 34:25.534
Mariana sold them to me.

34:30.074 --> 34:32.759
Mind if I use the men's room?

34:35.212 --> 34:37.880
Um, thanks,

34:37.915 --> 34:39.983
you know, for what you said in group.

34:40.016 --> 34:42.851
Yeah, it's no problem.

34:42.887 --> 34:45.088
Look at you and your new best friend.

34:45.121 --> 34:48.257
- Not quite.
- Least he don't talk much.

34:48.292 --> 34:52.762
That one always be pontificating.

34:52.797 --> 34:55.799
I know big words.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.168
Thank God I'm outta here in two weeks.

34:58.202 --> 35:02.105
- You're getting out?
- Got my approval for ILP.

35:02.139 --> 35:04.107
The Independent Living Program.

35:04.141 --> 35:07.210
Don't you have to be 18, or emancipated?

35:07.244 --> 35:11.147
Nope. You gotta be 16.
You get your own apartment.

35:11.182 --> 35:14.784
No roommates. They give you
money for living expenses

35:14.819 --> 35:17.020
and help you with school and other stuff.

35:17.054 --> 35:20.790
- And you just have to apply?
- You gotta do good here first.

35:20.825 --> 35:24.060
You won't get in without a
recommendation from Rita and your PO.

35:24.094 --> 35:28.164
I'm gonna get my diploma, no GED,

35:28.199 --> 35:31.000
and take some parenting classes
and get my baby girl back.

35:31.035 --> 35:35.071
- You have a kid?
- Yeah. She's two.

35:35.105 --> 35:38.007
In foster care like I was.

35:38.042 --> 35:42.846
But I ain't gonna be like my
mama. I'm gonna get her back.

35:44.181 --> 35:46.082
My little Tasha.

35:48.919 --> 35:50.954
Yeah, she comes first.

35:54.091 --> 35:56.192
Yo, what up in there?!

35:59.129 --> 36:02.799
- Re-lax, biotch.
- I got your "biotch."

36:22.953 --> 36:25.955
- You scared me.
- Nice hat.

36:25.990 --> 36:30.193
- Is that the one you stole?
- I didn't steal it, I swear.

36:30.227 --> 36:32.862
It was Kelsey.

36:32.897 --> 36:35.999
If you knew it was stolen,
why didn't you return it?

36:36.033 --> 36:39.002
Um... because Chase really liked it.

36:39.036 --> 36:42.138
Kelsey? Kelsey who you're not
supposed to be hanging out with Kelsey?

36:42.172 --> 36:45.208
OK, I know, but I thought
because it was for school stuff,

36:45.242 --> 36:48.978
- you know, for the play...
- Well, you can pack up all of the costumes, young lady,

36:49.013 --> 36:51.147
because you are done. No more
extracurricular activities.

36:51.181 --> 36:53.750
What?! All because of a stupid hat?

36:53.784 --> 36:56.119
No, Mariana. Because you are suspended.

36:56.153 --> 37:00.757
Kelsey told Principal
Sanchez about everything,

37:00.791 --> 37:02.859
including the pills.

37:19.076 --> 37:21.010
I'll take that.

37:23.781 --> 37:26.082
- No.
- You want me to call Michelle?

37:31.155 --> 37:36.125
Fine, you get caught with it, no more
sneaking out to see your boyfriend.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.127
Sure as hell no ILP.

37:42.099 --> 37:43.066
Give it.

37:47.004 --> 37:49.012
Smart.

37:49.021 --> 37:52.957
I'm gonna toss this.
It's for your own good.

37:52.992 --> 37:56.761
"Sometimes what's right isn't easy."

38:06.138 --> 38:07.839
Hey.

38:07.873 --> 38:11.876
I know I blew up today, I'm sorry.

38:11.911 --> 38:15.046
No. You were right.

38:15.080 --> 38:20.118
Look, I really thought about what you said.

38:22.888 --> 38:27.659
I get it, Brandon. I hear you.

38:29.161 --> 38:30.995
I knew alcohol was a problem.

38:31.030 --> 38:33.998
I wasn't conveniently forgetting.

38:34.033 --> 38:39.704
I was... hoping you were
too young to remember.

38:41.006 --> 38:42.874
I'm sorry.

38:47.947 --> 38:51.950
Look, I know this restraining order
seems drastic, but it's for the best.

38:53.686 --> 38:56.654
Believe me, I know firsthand how hard it is

38:56.722 --> 38:58.823
to be kept from the person
you want to see every day.

38:58.857 --> 39:01.859
I get it, ok? I've
heard it a million times.

39:01.894 --> 39:06.898
Mom broke your heart.

39:06.932 --> 39:11.769
I'm not talking about
Mom. I'm talking about you.

39:11.804 --> 39:15.807
I went from seeing you every day, 24/7,

39:15.841 --> 39:17.642
to once, twice a week.

39:18.944 --> 39:20.912
You're the love of my life, dummy.

39:29.688 --> 39:32.724
For piano this week.

39:32.758 --> 39:34.659
Is this teacher still
living up to the hype?

39:36.128 --> 39:39.897
He's great, but Dad, can you afford this?

39:39.932 --> 39:42.667
- You're not working.
- I'm on a paid vacation. Don't worry about me.

39:46.739 --> 39:48.806
Night.

40:06.825 --> 40:09.961
Um, hi, this is Brandon Foster.

40:09.995 --> 40:15.967
Um, I'm sorry to do this, but I can't
take piano lessons from you anymore.

40:16.001 --> 40:18.836
My family just can't afford it.

40:26.862 --> 40:29.697
Other than that, Mrs.
Lincoln, how was your day?

40:29.732 --> 40:35.720
Oh, it was, um... fine. Same old.

40:35.754 --> 40:39.741
- How was your first day back?
- Same as it ever was.

40:43.128 --> 40:46.130
My new partner is a delight.

40:50.069 --> 40:51.969
I'm exhausted.

40:58.177 --> 41:00.044
Me too.

41:13.092 --> 41:15.026
Good night, love.

41:17.196 --> 41:18.696
Good night, babe.
