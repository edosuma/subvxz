00:07.141 --> 00:10.211
[exciting music]

00:10.278 --> 00:17.418
* *

01:41.469 --> 01:43.704
- We've got rogue Romulan
factions closing in behind us.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.406
- We leaving the Neutral Zone.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.775
- The "Dauntless" has locked on
to our coordinates.

01:47.841 --> 01:48.742
They're hailing us.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.178
- Jamming comms.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.579
- How do our shields look?

01:51.645 --> 01:52.813
- Shields at maximum.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.715
- Ahh! Oh, we've got incoming!

01:54.782 --> 01:56.950
[torpedoes pulse, all scream]

01:57.017 --> 01:58.519
- Shields at 23%.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.221
- Rok, send the message,
Morse Code.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.455
Fire off their bow.

02:01.522 --> 02:06.194
- Do not contact,
virus aboard.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.628
- Nope, they don't get it.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.497
They just think
we're firing at them.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.898
Round two inbound!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.800
- Evasive maneuvers!

02:12.866 --> 02:15.969
- Shields are gone, captain.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.738
- We're caught in
their tractor beam.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.274
If they take our ship,
the Living Construct activates.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.743
- Then disable that beam.
Open fire!

02:22.810 --> 02:24.245
[tense music]

02:24.312 --> 02:26.113
- Oh boy,
they didn't like that.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.549
Torpedo three coming our way!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.018
- Brace for impact.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.720
- End simulation.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.154
[all groan]

02:34.222 --> 02:36.990
- Oh, well, maybe we'll
nail it the 87th time.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.326
- Doesn't matter.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.229
No matter what we try,
we lose every time.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.364
- We'll find a way out
of the Neutral Zone.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.965
We'll get to the Federation.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.134
- Maybe it's time we consider

02:47.201 --> 02:49.770
we stop trying
to go to Starfleet.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.740
- Wow.
It's like a funeral in here.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.742
- Might as well be.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.177
Our dreams of joining
the Federation are dead.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.980
- You've been up for days.
Get some rest.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.217
What isn't present today
might reveal itself tomorrow.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.119
- In stressful times
like this,

03:06.186 --> 03:09.189
Jankom Pog knows
just the solution.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.161
- This does make me
feel a lot better,

03:14.228 --> 03:18.699
but what sort of lunatic
would whip cream?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.133
- Who was I kidding?

03:20.200 --> 03:24.372
Starfleet is the best
and brightest in the galaxy,

03:24.438 --> 03:28.141
and I'm just some accident
from a petri dish.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.843
- Sounds like
you earned yourself

03:29.910 --> 03:32.780
two more scoops of sadness.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.417
all: Pile it on!
[laughter]

03:36.484 --> 03:40.220
- That Tellarite officer said
lots of mean things about me.

03:40.288 --> 03:45.526
Jankom can take it,
but to call me short...

03:45.593 --> 03:47.094
[laughter]

03:47.160 --> 03:49.263
all: Pile it on!

03:49.330 --> 03:54.935
- What Jankom wouldn't give
to slap his soggy jowls.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.505
With words, of course.
[laughs]

03:57.571 --> 03:59.907
- I'd like to slap
my father for all he's

03:59.973 --> 04:02.943
put me through, with my hand.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.079
[laughter]

04:08.882 --> 04:10.751
- Let's hit the holo-sim
at 0800.

04:10.818 --> 04:15.423
- How about 08-whenever-
Pog-wakes-up-hundred?

04:17.090 --> 04:20.027
- [yawns, sighs]

04:20.093 --> 04:23.864
Computer, turn everything off.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.368
Let the darkness take me.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.037
[soft mournful music playing]

04:30.103 --> 04:32.940
* *

04:33.006 --> 04:35.676
Computer, music off.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.010
[computer chirps]

04:37.077 --> 04:39.880
[music continues]

04:39.947 --> 04:44.985
* *

04:45.052 --> 04:48.288
- Huh?

04:48.356 --> 04:51.859
- Did anyone else just
see a feral human suffering

04:51.925 --> 04:54.695
from malnutrition
strolling around on our ship?

04:54.762 --> 04:59.733
- No, but some odd-looking
glittery puffball

04:59.800 --> 05:02.169
is giving me kissy lips?

05:02.235 --> 05:06.840
[alien chirping softly]

05:06.907 --> 05:08.942
- Glittersmooch!

05:09.009 --> 05:11.244
Glittersmooch!
[giggles]

05:11.311 --> 05:12.980
Oh my gosh,
aren't you the cutest thing.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.214
- Wow, you know that thing?

05:14.281 --> 05:16.083
- I take care of them
in my holo-sim,

05:16.149 --> 05:18.118
"Delta Heart
Magical Veterinarian."

05:18.185 --> 05:19.553
- Look, I ain't judging,

05:19.620 --> 05:21.955
but how did your holo-pet
escape the holodeck?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.057
- There must be a malfunction
with the holo-emitters.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.394
- That would explain
the feral human.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.396
- But it doesn't make sense.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.930
These holograms
aren't permitted

05:29.997 --> 05:32.966
to leave the holodeck, unless--

05:33.033 --> 05:37.337
I fear it may be far worse.

05:37.405 --> 05:44.111
Friends, I believe we never
left the holodeck at all.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.046
- It wasn't real?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.180
The ship?

05:47.247 --> 05:49.049
The mess hall?
[gasps]

05:49.116 --> 05:50.217
The ice cream?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.052
- All of them, fake.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.353
- Not the ice cream.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.623
- All of it, a simulation.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.959
Computer, exit program.
[computer chirps]

05:59.026 --> 06:01.194
Computer, summon arch.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.296
[computer chirps]

06:03.363 --> 06:05.165
Janeway, can you read me?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.567
- Loud and clear.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.335
I'm detecting your life signs

06:08.402 --> 06:09.903
inside the holodeck,
all right,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.473
but the arch
refuses to respond.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.007
A disruption in subspace
could be interfering

06:14.074 --> 06:15.543
with the ship's functions.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.578
Try to sit tight while
I get to the bottom of it.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.312
- If we're all
stuck in one room,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.348
how is Zero
all the way over there?

06:21.415 --> 06:24.518
- Motion floor tracking,
visual horizon manipulation.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.254
A holodeck tricks the mind
to create any scenario.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.256
- I recognize
this holo-program.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.959
I often spend
my recreational time here.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.360
Come in, come in.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.262
It's quite enjoyable.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.130
[soft eerie music]

06:37.197 --> 06:40.000
- Well, if we're
trapped here a while,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.969
we may as well enjoy it.

06:43.036 --> 06:47.541
- Welcome to the headquarters
of the Cellar Door Society,

06:47.608 --> 06:50.410
purveyors of puzzling puzzles,
amateur sleuthing,

06:50.478 --> 06:52.079
and milquetoast mysteries.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.247
- Yeah, this is a hard pass.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.316
- I don't think
we have a choice.

06:56.383 --> 07:00.387
So what dorky task
do we have to do?

07:00.454 --> 07:03.557
Return an overdue library book?
[chuckles]

07:03.624 --> 07:05.659
- [scoffs]
Dal, the Cellar Door Society

07:05.726 --> 07:07.761
deals with
precarious adventures,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.930
like the Case
of the Phony Pharaoh,

07:09.997 --> 07:12.299
or the Case of the
Biting Ghost, or the Case--

07:12.365 --> 07:14.134
- Ooh, found a clue.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.569
[blows raspberry]
This is dumb.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.104
Let's get out of here.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.772
- You can tease all you want,

07:18.839 --> 07:21.775
but every time
I solve a mystery,

07:21.842 --> 07:24.845
the program ends
and the arch reappears.

07:24.912 --> 07:28.482
- So if we play detective,
we'll find a way out.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.417
- All right,
what's the mystery?

07:30.484 --> 07:35.255
- It only reveals itself
at the stroke of midnight.

07:35.322 --> 07:39.059
[bell tolling]
Aha!

07:39.126 --> 07:40.594
[knock at door]

07:40.661 --> 07:44.565
[suspenseful music]

07:44.632 --> 07:47.400
The mystery is a feet.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.070
Get it? Feet.
It's at our--eh?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.773
- "For the Cellar Door Society.

07:52.840 --> 07:57.344
Together, you can
solve the case."

07:57.410 --> 07:59.580
- The sooner
we solve the mystery,

07:59.647 --> 08:01.414
the sooner we can
leave the holodeck.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.117
- Uh, it's just scribbles.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.519
- Oh, yeah.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.221
Jankom's having
a blast already.

08:08.288 --> 08:12.392
[Murf chirruping, grunting]

08:12.459 --> 08:14.595
- Gwyn, use your
linguistic skills.

08:14.662 --> 08:15.996
What language is this?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.097
- No language.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.131
It's gibberish.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.034
- Or maybe it's a clue.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.403
- This sounds like
a lot of work, Zero.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.938
- Think, Dal.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.276
The envelope said the clues
were meant for us, together.

08:29.342 --> 08:36.483
* *

08:37.618 --> 08:39.820
- Murf, put your paper
over mine.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.423
Jankom!
- Huh?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.262
- Cellar Door Society,
endless adventure

08:49.329 --> 08:50.664
awaits you with the case--

08:50.731 --> 08:52.933
- The Case of the
Lost Skeleton Key!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.068
That's what we're after
to solve the mystery.

08:55.135 --> 08:59.206
- Great, so we find a key,
then this dumb holo ends?

08:59.272 --> 09:00.941
- An excellent deduction.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.175
- Sounds easy enough.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.945
- [laughs]
Skeleton key?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.581
[scoffs] What's it made of?
Bones or something?

09:07.648 --> 09:08.916
- Don't look at me.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.885
I'm just doing what
everyone else is doing.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.187
- What is that?

09:14.254 --> 09:17.457
[engines revving]
[driving rock music playing]

09:17.524 --> 09:21.428
- And did we just get
a music soundtrack?

09:21.494 --> 09:28.401
* *

09:28.468 --> 09:30.270
- [laughs]

09:30.337 --> 09:31.805
Look at short stuff here.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.374
Did you come to get stepped on?

09:34.441 --> 09:35.876
- You know these guys, Zero?

09:35.943 --> 09:38.812
- No, this is
something different.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.481
- [growls]

09:41.548 --> 09:44.985
- Is it me, or do they
all kind of look like--

09:45.052 --> 09:46.186
- Yep.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.121
[groans]
It's my program.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.691
Jankom's been using
this street fighting sim

09:50.758 --> 09:53.593
to let off some steam.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.129
- I'm starting to worry
one of these hooligans

09:56.196 --> 09:57.430
knows something about our key.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.499
- I'm not worried
about getting hurt.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.568
I'm worried
our two holo-programs

10:01.635 --> 10:03.103
have somehow merged.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.639
- [groaning]

10:05.706 --> 10:08.475
Leave the key to me. Hoo.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.979
Stand back and watch me play.

10:12.045 --> 10:18.551
* *

10:21.789 --> 10:23.824
Who's got arms?
Give us the key!

10:23.891 --> 10:26.559
[grunts, laughs]

10:26.626 --> 10:28.361
- [yelling]
- Whoa!

10:28.428 --> 10:31.932
- Okay, now I see why you all
spend so much time in here.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.735
- But don't worry,
the safety protocols are on.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.672
It is impossible
to get hurt in here.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.174
Whoa!
[grunts]

10:41.241 --> 10:45.345
[groans]
Hey, that actually hurt.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.646
- Oh, no.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.249
- What happened
to the safety protocols?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.019
- They've been shut off.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.055
[grunts] I don't think
this is a game anymore.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.656
Janeway!

10:56.724 --> 10:59.026
- I'm trying to re-enable
safety protocols out here,

10:59.092 --> 11:00.761
but my settings
only allow work

11:00.828 --> 11:02.996
on non-essential functions.
Dal, could you--

11:03.063 --> 11:06.834
- Use my command code,
GB64N32X!

11:06.900 --> 11:08.035
Whoa! Ah!

11:08.101 --> 11:09.737
This hologram
really doesn't want us

11:09.803 --> 11:11.471
to find the Skeleton Key.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.374
- This isn't a game anymore.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.909
- [shrieks]

11:15.976 --> 11:16.977
- [growls]

11:17.044 --> 11:19.079
[yelling]

11:19.146 --> 11:21.414
- We could die in here!

11:21.481 --> 11:23.016
[laughs]

11:23.083 --> 11:25.152
- [grunts, yells]

11:25.218 --> 11:28.455
[suspenseful music]

11:28.521 --> 11:30.423
- The key.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.360
Grab him--it may be our
only way out of this program.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.263
The tattooed ruffian flees.

11:36.329 --> 11:42.970
* *

11:46.073 --> 11:47.040
- Please?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.743
[all panting]

11:51.178 --> 11:53.146
- Shouldn't the arch be
appearing right about now?

11:53.213 --> 11:57.851
- You kids will never escape.
[groans]

11:57.918 --> 12:00.687
- His tattoo,
it ain't just a key.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.990
- The Key Club?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.960
[all gasp]

12:07.027 --> 12:07.995
- Where'd he go?

12:09.562 --> 12:12.732
[thunder rumbling]

12:12.800 --> 12:15.969
What's happening now?

12:16.036 --> 12:20.373
[up-tempo jazz music playing]

12:20.440 --> 12:22.843
- We've unlocked
the next chapter.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.349
[indistinct chatter]

12:29.416 --> 12:32.519
[soft jazz music playing]

12:32.585 --> 12:36.489
* *

12:36.556 --> 12:39.492
- Whose simulation is this?
- [laughs]

12:39.559 --> 12:41.862
Uh, not mine.
- [laughs]

12:41.929 --> 12:44.397
Look what the cat dragged in.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.167
Come on up here and give us
a song, would you?

12:47.234 --> 12:53.006
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Murfy No Shoes!

12:53.073 --> 12:59.412
- * So you're feeling blue
and having a bad day *

12:59.479 --> 13:02.215
all: Murf?
- * Don't you fret it *

13:02.282 --> 13:04.184
* Just smile and forget it *

13:04.251 --> 13:05.953
[upbeat jazz music playing]

13:06.019 --> 13:07.587
* With your cup half full *

13:07.654 --> 13:10.090
* I swear those blues
won't stay *

13:10.157 --> 13:13.660
- Uh...what?

13:13.726 --> 13:16.363
- Murf can speak?
- And Murf can dance!

13:16.429 --> 13:17.898
- Or convincingly lip sync.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.232
- Let's split up
and find the key

13:19.299 --> 13:21.701
before things get any stranger.

13:21.768 --> 13:25.805
- * If the skies
are sometimes gray *

13:25.873 --> 13:27.240
* The sun can... *

13:27.307 --> 13:30.377
- Barista,
could I get a Jumja tea?

13:30.443 --> 13:32.279
You wouldn't happen
to have seen a--

13:32.345 --> 13:34.982
- Jumja tea coming right up.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.217
- [gasps]
How are you--?

13:37.284 --> 13:38.618
[suspenseful music]

13:38.685 --> 13:40.820
- You look like
you've seen a ghost.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.490
- My father's holo must have
merged with the others.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.358
- You know,
I don't just serve drinks.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.994
I listen as well.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.363
- I guess I'm just
surprised to see you here.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.633
- [chuckles]
Do we know each other?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.936
- Not as well as you'd think.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.845
- [gasps]
- What are you looking at?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.314
- Is that from--

14:07.380 --> 14:11.518
- Yep, another patient from
"Delta Heart Hospital."

14:11.584 --> 14:14.187
- The further into
the maze we go,

14:14.254 --> 14:17.357
the more the simulations merge.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.460
- There's thousands
of programs in the databanks.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.429
Why is it choosing all of ours?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.764
- Ooh!
Fascinating observation.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.667
The holodeck may have
more than a malfunction.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.002
It has a motive.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.205
- Are you saying this is
happening for a reason?

14:32.272 --> 14:34.942
- Anyone seen a skeleton key?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.143
Looking for a skeleton key.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.344
Hey, you, skeleton key?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.445
Have you seen a skeleton key?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.981
Anybody? Key? Skeleton?

14:42.349 --> 14:43.816
[stammers]

14:43.883 --> 14:45.052
[all growl]

14:45.118 --> 14:47.921
Time to go-go.

14:47.988 --> 14:52.025
- My father put the fate
of our world on my shoulders,

14:52.092 --> 14:53.826
without ever asking.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.363
- Sounds like despite
your pop's intentions,

14:56.429 --> 14:57.630
you gotta find your own way.

14:57.697 --> 15:02.435
- Speaking of,
which way out of here?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.837
- Get them! Over there!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.239
No, not there! There!

15:06.306 --> 15:08.541
- There are two mysteries
at hand.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.378
First, the Case
of the Skeleton Key.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.514
Second, the riddle
as to why the holodeck

15:14.581 --> 15:16.349
has trapped us here.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.118
[upbeat jazz music playing]

15:18.185 --> 15:21.221
- * You won't regret it *

15:21.288 --> 15:23.723
* Just smile and forget it *

15:23.790 --> 15:27.660
* *

15:27.727 --> 15:28.996
- Hmm.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.164
For such a swanky joint,

15:31.231 --> 15:32.865
you'd think they'd fix
that piano.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.467
- Fix it?

15:34.534 --> 15:37.337
- Sounds like it's got
a missing key.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.571
[gasps]

15:42.309 --> 15:43.977
[key clicking softly]

15:44.044 --> 15:45.645
both:
The missing key!

15:45.712 --> 15:47.147
[all gasp]

15:47.214 --> 15:48.448
- Get them!

15:48.515 --> 15:50.350
- The piano has a missing key!

15:50.417 --> 15:51.985
- Let's pop this blow stand.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.586
- I don't think
that's how it goes.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.555
- Move it, piano man.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.757
[soft piano flourish]

15:57.824 --> 15:59.592
- Spectacular.
- Murf!

15:59.659 --> 16:02.229
[gangsters shouting]

16:02.295 --> 16:04.031
- To the next adventure.
[all yelling]

16:08.001 --> 16:09.736
[all yelling]

16:09.802 --> 16:13.773
- The program's breaking down,
merging with the others.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.408
[soft adventurous music]

16:15.475 --> 16:18.078
- Ahoy!
Welcome back, Captain.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.513
Prepare for a long journey.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.050
- Uh...
- Hah.

16:23.116 --> 16:27.320
Okay, so I sneak in here
once in a while too.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.522
It's nice to have a crew
that respects me.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.525
- Fancy a snack, Cap'n?
- No time.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.462
The key has to be on board.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.031
- All right, me hearties,

16:38.098 --> 16:40.700
we're looking
for a rare treasure,

16:40.767 --> 16:42.602
a skeleton key!

16:42.669 --> 16:43.736
- Aye-aye!
- Aye-aye-aye!

16:43.803 --> 16:45.672
- We'll find it.
- We will find it!

16:45.738 --> 16:48.241
- I shall go overboard to look!

16:52.045 --> 16:53.780
[deep rumbling]
[all gasp]

16:53.846 --> 16:56.583
[water bubbling]

16:56.649 --> 16:58.785
[creature roaring]

16:58.851 --> 17:00.620
- [yells]

17:00.687 --> 17:04.424
Monster! Off the port bow!

17:04.491 --> 17:07.560
- No, no, no, no, no!
[yelling]

17:07.627 --> 17:11.431
[suspenseful music]

17:11.498 --> 17:15.102
* *

17:15.168 --> 17:18.871
- That's not a monster.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.708
It's a sparkle sea-hugger!

17:21.774 --> 17:24.411
My favorite!

17:24.477 --> 17:26.979
- The corrupted holodeck
programs are bleeding together

17:27.046 --> 17:29.416
at a wildly dangerous pace.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.751
- If we don't find
that key pronto,

17:31.818 --> 17:33.986
we're gonna be hugged to death.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.425
* *

17:38.491 --> 17:41.361
- No, Sea-Hugger!
No more hugging!

17:41.428 --> 17:44.030
Bad girl! Bad!

17:47.234 --> 17:49.969
- [screaming]
- [gasps]

17:50.036 --> 17:57.043
* *

17:57.110 --> 17:59.279
- This is from your sim, Rok.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.780
How did you
take care of it before?

18:00.847 --> 18:03.816
- Uh...uh...

18:03.883 --> 18:06.619
This poor creature
is malnourished.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.721
I prescribe fruit and fiber.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.523
Fire!

18:14.827 --> 18:16.729
[creature shrieking happily]

18:21.301 --> 18:23.536
- Nice vet work, Rok.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.039
Any chance you practiced
ship repair too?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.408
- I'm in my happy place,

18:28.475 --> 18:30.877
surrounded by colorful
creatures, snuggling.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.645
- We're taking on water.

18:32.712 --> 18:36.149
- [gasps]
You really are a detective.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.950
- Hey, guys,
Murf found another clue.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.919
- [chirping]

18:39.986 --> 18:41.854
- Look, it's a compass.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.956
- Pointing us to the
Delta Heart Vet?

18:44.023 --> 18:46.193
- [groans]
This game never ends.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.460
- Never ends.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.163
Stop, we're not going anywhere.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.532
- Easy for you to say.
You can float.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.467
- Yes, we could
follow the compass,

18:54.534 --> 18:57.770
but it'd just lead us
to another clue, and another.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.708
there is no skeleton key.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.244
- [chirping angrily]

19:04.311 --> 19:06.979
- Yeah, you said
if we solve the mystery,

19:07.046 --> 19:08.615
we get out of here.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.950
- The missing key is a ruse
to keep us preoccupied

19:11.017 --> 19:12.619
from solving the real mystery:

19:12.685 --> 19:14.687
why we're trapped
in the first place.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.389
Let me deduce.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.858
At first, we would've never
known we were in the holodeck

19:18.925 --> 19:22.229
if it hadn't been
for those glitches.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.564
After Rok astutely observed
our favorite

19:24.631 --> 19:26.799
recreational simulations
were involved,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.935
I knew it couldn't be
a glitch, a malfunction,

19:29.001 --> 19:32.672
or even a disruption
in subspace as Janeway noted.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.943
It must be a calculated attempt
to keep us here.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.145
- You kids will never escape.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.448
- Stay a while.
Sing us a song, would you?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.883
- Prepare for a long journey.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.253
[suspenseful music]

19:46.319 --> 19:49.021
- [grunts]
Okay, someone did this to us.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.491
Who and why?
- Was it my father?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.960
- No, but the culprit
is on this very ship.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.030
And the only way to win is if
we refuse to play her game.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.501
[all yelling]

20:04.237 --> 20:06.239
- Thank goodness you're okay.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.144
Why are you looking at me
like you don't recognize me?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.647
- Janeway, did you
lock us in here

20:14.714 --> 20:16.583
and turn off
the safety protocols?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.486
- Of course not.
I would never.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.154
- For all she knows,
she's telling the truth.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.624
But I fear she's
unknowingly been manipulated

20:24.691 --> 20:27.860
by a secret subroutine
pre-programmed

20:27.927 --> 20:30.263
to intervene if the
ship's core directive

20:30.330 --> 20:33.333
was ever interfered with.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.036
Computer, show security feed
of Hologram Janeway,

20:37.103 --> 20:39.306
start of simulation.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.345
- Maybe it's time
we consider we stop

20:45.412 --> 20:47.280
trying to go to Starfleet.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.219
She wouldn't allow us to stray
from the ship's mission.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.088
- From the very beginning,
she inspired us

20:56.155 --> 20:57.957
to go to Starfleet.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.359
Was it all a lie?

20:59.426 --> 21:03.363
- No, because we had
the same goal.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.732
It wasn't until we all agreed
we should never

21:05.798 --> 21:09.302
go to Federation space
that her sinister motives

21:09.369 --> 21:11.338
for activated.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.206
- Computer,
create holo-program

21:14.273 --> 21:16.909
to keep the crew
distracted indefinitely,

21:16.976 --> 21:18.378
no restrictions.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.712
- Acknowledged.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.682
- So you did turn off
the safety protocols.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.318
Then what did you need
my command codes for?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.487
- To take control
of the ship so it would

21:27.554 --> 21:30.156
complete its mission
and destroy Starfleet.

21:30.222 --> 21:34.394
- Use my command code,
GB64N32X!

21:35.895 --> 21:38.531
- Federation coordinates
acquired.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.068
- I'm so sorry.

21:42.134 --> 21:47.139
I'd never intentionally
do anything to hurt you.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.376
- But the Construct would.

21:49.442 --> 21:53.380
- I don't remember
doing any of this.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.916
I--I think Zero's correct.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.019
There's something
wrong with me.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.889
[alarm blaring]
[all gasp]

22:02.955 --> 22:05.892
[tense music]

22:05.958 --> 22:12.899
* *

22:16.969 --> 22:18.371
- We've left the Neutral Zone.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.240
- [groans] And we're locked out
of the controls.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.683
- I'm sorry.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.959
[wondrous music]

22:40.026 --> 22:47.166
