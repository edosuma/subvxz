Sure.

There's a lady gonna come
looking for me a little later.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.390

She gonna stay
for dinner?

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560

you're just
in time.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.570
Want to go with us and see

University of Hawaii.

When I want <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Hawaii{\r},</font></font></i>

02:12.330 --> 02:14.220
I take out the Aloha
Pussycats.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.090
That's good
Hawaii, yeah.
That's Hawaii.
Very good Hawaii.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.090
Aloha.
Yeah.
All right, Fonz,
see ya.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.090
All right,
let's make it fast.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.590
I want to get
front row seats.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.090
Ralph, I'm not sitting
next to you

02:22.590 --> 02:24.590
if you're gonna make the bunny
shadows on the screen.

02:25.090 --> 02:26.600
They're not bunnies,
they're ducks.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.990
Oh, excuse me,
pardon me,
Oh.

02:35.990 --> 02:36.990
I'm sorry...
No, I'm sorry.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.490
It's my fault,
I was, uh,

02:38.490 --> 02:40.490
carried away by that
delicious aroma.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.000
Oh, that's
parmigiana.
Oh.

I'm looking for, um,
an Arthur Fonzarelli.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
He told me to
watch for you.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.010
This way.
Thank you.

02:53.010 --> 02:54.010
I'm Al.

02:54.010 --> 02:55.510
Hi, Al.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.960
Uh, this is
my restaurant.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.380
Very nice place.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.630
I own it.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.770
Oh, this is
Mr. Fonzarelli.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.050
I have to get back
to my kitchen now.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.940
Little old lady,
huh?

03:11.810 --> 03:13.810
Little old lady?

03:13.810 --> 03:15.310
Oh yeah, yeah,
see look,

03:15.310 --> 03:17.810
I told Al that I was
waiting for this lady

03:17.810 --> 03:19.320
that dropped
off the car.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.820
You're not
a little old lady.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.070
I would remember you.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.650
That was my Aunt Grace.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.290
Yeah, cranky little
old lady, huh?

03:27.460 --> 03:29.040
Yeah.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.540
I'm Adriana Prescott.

03:30.910 --> 03:31.880
Fonzie.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.710
Hi, Fonzie.
Hey.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.080
Uh, were you able to fix my car?

03:35.330 --> 03:38.920
Hey, I can fix anything that
starts with a key and goes...

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
(growls)

03:42.420 --> 03:43.920
Ah, well, good.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.920
Uh, may I sit down?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.930
Oh, yeah,
plant yourself.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.930
Thank you.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.430
I'm exhausted.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.930
It's just been an
incredible day.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.430
First my car
breaks down,

03:53.430 --> 03:54.730
and my tennis
racket splits...

03:54.980 --> 03:55.490
No kidding.

03:55.820 --> 03:56.900
No kidding,

03:56.900 --> 03:58.400
and then my poodle gets
a tick in the park.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.190
Do you believe it? Have you
ever had a day like that?

04:00.410 --> 04:01.990
No, my poodle hates the park,

04:01.990 --> 04:04.830
loves the opera, though.

04:05.110 --> 04:06.160
That's funny.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.110
Thank you.
Excuse me,

04:08.620 --> 04:09.620
I thought you might want

04:09.620 --> 04:12.620
to try just a small taste
of my parmigiana.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.500
A small taste, Al?

04:14.750 --> 04:16.339
It's an Italian
taste.
Oh.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.339
Mmm.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.339
Mmm, it's <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">delicioso{\r}!</font></font></i>

04:21.339 --> 04:22.350
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Grazie{\r}.</font></font></i>

<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Prego{\r}.</font></font></i>

04:24.850 --> 04:26.130
FONZIE:
Hey, Al?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.100
Scramola.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.440
Mmm.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.860
My father liked cars, too.

04:37.190 --> 04:39.230
Yeah, he's a man
after my own heart.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.700
In fact, in 1950,

04:41.700 --> 04:43.950
he had a car
in the Indianapolis 500.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.740
Your father had a car
in Indianapolis 500?

04:47.150 --> 04:49.160
Mm-hmm, I mean, it blew
an engine after four laps.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.570
Well, what difference
does it make?

04:50.570 --> 04:51.570
At least he was there!

04:52.080 --> 04:53.580
I mean, I remember
that race, you know?

04:53.990 --> 04:55.580
Who-who won
that race?

04:55.580 --> 04:57.580
Oh.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.580
Hey, girls, knock
yourselves out,

05:00.580 --> 05:02.590
I'm really sorry, it was
a slip of the fingers,

05:02.590 --> 05:03.590
slip of
the fingers.
Aw.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.090
I love you,
I love you.

05:05.090 --> 05:06.590
I'll call you a little
later, all right?

05:06.590 --> 05:08.980
Aaayyh!

05:10.310 --> 05:11.810
You just...

05:11.810 --> 05:12.810
you just do that and they...

05:13.230 --> 05:15.320
Hey, say, that's
a nice trick.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.730
Oh, it ain't no trick,
it's a gift.

05:19.190 --> 05:21.190
Well, don't ever give it back.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.520
Oh, I won't.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.410
You're fascinating.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.410
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.740
Tell me about yourself.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.080
Well, there's not much to tell,

05:29.080 --> 05:32.080
I am the best mechanic
in a large, Midwestern city.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.030
You must have other interests.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.040
Aaayyh!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.430
Well, uh, I think
I better be going.

05:43.930 --> 05:45.430
Thank you for
fixing my car.

05:45.930 --> 05:46.930
Oh, yeah.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.930
Listen, you have any more
problems with that car,

05:48.930 --> 05:51.930
you just let me know,
I'll give it the magic touch.

05:51.930 --> 05:52.940
I'll do that.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.440
Yeah, you do that.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.440
Ah, if you're ever

05:57.940 --> 05:58.940
Valley Vista

05:59.440 --> 06:00.940
why don't you stop
in and say hello?

06:00.940 --> 06:03.950
The Valley Vista
Tennis Club...

06:03.950 --> 06:05.950
I sure will.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.950
Good.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.900
You do play tennis,
don't you?

06:09.900 --> 06:11.950
Hey, like a pro.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.460
How about tomorrow
afternoon, doubles?

06:16.460 --> 06:19.460
Doubles, triples,
whatever you want.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.470
You're cute.

MARION:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Don't worry, Arthur{\r}.</font></font></i>

06:37.430 --> 06:39.020
No, it's gonna
be all right,

06:39.520 --> 06:41.520
'cause Richard is gonna go
to the club with you.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.020
Yeah, I know, but just
for moral support.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.020
Now look, Mrs. C.,
I got 40 minutes.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.410
Will you teach me
everything I can
know here?

06:46.690 --> 06:49.280
Arthur, the first thing
to remember about tennis

06:49.780 --> 06:52.280
is it's a game of patience
and politeness.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.780
Yeah, right.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.780
Now, uh, Richard will
be down in a minute,

06:55.780 --> 06:58.280
and remember...
patience...

06:58.280 --> 06:59.290
and politeness.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.290
I remember.
Yes.

07:00.290 --> 07:01.790
Now, what would you like
to learn first?

07:01.790 --> 07:03.290
You want to learn
the forehand,

07:03.290 --> 07:04.790
or the backhand...

07:04.790 --> 07:06.790
Mrs. C, I don't
care...
I'll teach you
to serve...

07:06.790 --> 07:08.210
Yeah, that's good,
I got it.

07:08.540 --> 07:12.050
Look, I-I don't know if
I can do this Mrs. C.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.930
Oh, yes, you can do it.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.270
Now the way to learn
something is to do it.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.020
Mrs. C., I learned some of
my best stuff that way.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.970
Okay, Fonz, ready to go.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.030
Oh, Richard, good,
you and Joanie,

07:24.030 --> 07:26.030
I need you to help me
in this demonstration

07:26.030 --> 07:27.530
of the teamwork
of doubles.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.370
Here are your rackets,
dear.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.200
No.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.700
No, I-I can't play
with this.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.200
I can't play
with a flyswatter.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.710
I'm better
with a spatula.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.490
This is silly.
Oh, you want
the spatula?

07:39.740 --> 07:40.830
JOANIE:
No.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.160
I'm losing my
patience.

07:42.410 --> 07:44.000
Children, get into
your positions,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Arthur, you will serve.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
All right.
Here?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.500
No, no, Arthur,

07:50.500 --> 07:52.000
that's-that's
ping-pong.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.010
It's...

07:53.010 --> 07:55.010
I know that.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.510
All right, all right, all right,
you look very silly.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.010
All right, all right,
all right.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.510
You ready for this?
Right.
Right.

08:00.510 --> 08:02.520
All right,
watch yourself here.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.520
Rush to the net!

08:05.520 --> 08:07.020
What net?
The sofa.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.350
The sofa.
Oh, oh, yeah,

08:08.650 --> 08:10.070
all right.
Right,
and I return it!

08:10.360 --> 08:11.940
Now, let's
go back!
I was just
back there.

08:11.940 --> 08:12.940
Move it!

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
What happened
to your politeness?

08:14.440 --> 08:15.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.950
Yes, polite, polite.

08:16.950 --> 08:18.280
Now, forehand.

08:18.580 --> 08:19.670
RICHIE:
Backhand.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.500
MARION:
And backhand.
JOANIE:
And volley it.

08:21.950 --> 08:22.870
And lob.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.200
Oh, it's a lob,
it's a lob!

08:24.200 --> 08:25.710
I got it, I got!
Can...

08:25.710 --> 08:26.510
can I smash it, Mom?

08:26.510 --> 08:27.590
Don't hit the lamp.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.540
Okay, all right,
I'm gonna smash it!

08:28.790 --> 08:30.790
All right, watch this!

08:31.130 --> 08:32.630
JOANIE:
Oh.

08:33.010 --> 08:35.380
Not even gonna try
and return it, huh, Fonz?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.130
Why should I?
It was out.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.860
How could he possibly
call that?

08:44.860 --> 08:45.780
It was on the line.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.190
I don't argue
with children.
See?

08:47.190 --> 08:49.200
You really got it,
that was wonderful.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
Thank you.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.650
I saw it,
it was out.

08:57.490 --> 08:58.570
Well, Howard,

08:58.570 --> 09:01.570
we were just playing a
make-believe point here.

09:01.570 --> 09:04.580
Oh really, Marion?

09:04.580 --> 09:07.580
That's funny, I thought you were
ganging up on a fly.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.080
Yeah.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.080
Good one, Dad.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.590
Look, the game is
over, folks.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.090
This tired, working man
is gonna sit down

09:15.590 --> 09:17.090
right in the middle
of your court.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.590
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.090
We're gonna have
to get going, Fonz.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.480
Yeah, you're right.
Oh, you're gonna
do just fine.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.350
I bet you win the
set six-love.

09:23.850 --> 09:24.850
Love?
Oh, that's right,

09:25.350 --> 09:26.350
I forgot to teach
you about love.

09:26.350 --> 09:27.850
Whoa, Mrs. C!

09:28.270 --> 09:32.240
Fonzie, love is a term
of scoring in tennis.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.610
Oh, yeah?

09:33.610 --> 09:36.610
Scoring... love.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.030
I think I'm gonna
like this game.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.330
Ho, Richard.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.370
Oh.

09:44.370 --> 09:45.700
How do you think
he'll do, Richard?

09:45.950 --> 09:49.420
He's in big trouble
if they use a real ball.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.810
Okay, Fonz,
we can eat in here.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.310
Why didn't you tell me

10:14.310 --> 10:16.320
that you get so tired
playing this game?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.320
I mean, how come I do
all the running?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.320
Well, you would've
run a lot less

10:21.320 --> 10:22.820
if you let her hit the ball
occasionally.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.820
I was being polite, like
your mother told me,

10:24.820 --> 10:26.830
I was being
polite.
Right.

10:26.830 --> 10:27.830
Hey, hey, hey, let me
ask you a question.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.830
Is it all right
if we sit here?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.830
Thank you so much
for all your warmth.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.590
Look at this, they
don't even clean up.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.970
I hope I didn't hurt
that Douglas guy.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.310
Well, uh,

10:43.640 --> 10:45.560
he seems like he's still
a little upset.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.760
I should have told you
about that custom.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.150
Yeah, I think you should, right.

10:49.150 --> 10:50.650
When he was coming
over that net,

10:50.650 --> 10:51.650
I thought he was on the attack.

10:52.070 --> 10:52.650
Yeah.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.150
You practically
slugged him over

10:54.150 --> 10:54.990
to the other side again.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.320
I didn't mean to do that.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.820
Hey Richie?
Guess what?

10:57.820 --> 10:58.820
In spite of old Sexy Legs,

10:59.330 --> 11:00.330
they still want
to fix you up

Millicent.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.280
Oh, blind date,
huh?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.330
Yeah, I-I'm not too good
on blind dates.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.330
Okay.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.330
I'll just make up
some excuse.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.170

you played tennis, right?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.480

11:34.480 --> 11:35.980
Not really.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.980
No, you did

there is one thing
I gotta know.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.870

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
We lost, six-love.

They have a terrific

Oh, yes!

12:56.940 --> 12:58.440
They have terrific weather,

13:12.710 --> 13:15.160

13:27.310 --> 13:28.890
Oh, I know you were
talking about me.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.390
No, we weren't, Fonz.

13:30.390 --> 13:31.890
We were talking about
the University of Hawaii.

13:31.890 --> 13:32.900
You can't kid me, Red.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400

13:34.400 --> 13:35.680
You know what they say.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.980
Fonzie, I think maybe you and I

13:45.770 --> 13:48.360
Look, I'm not talking about age.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.860

13:53.780 --> 13:55.780
I did fine today
at the club, right?

13:55.780 --> 13:56.750
I played some tennis,

13:56.750 --> 13:58.250
played a little piano...

13:58.250 --> 14:00.290
Decked a man.
You told him.

14:02.290 --> 14:03.790
Oh, it, it
made him laugh.

14:04.790 --> 14:06.300
It made me laugh.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.300
But that's not funny.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
Look, you can get
along in any set.

But how do you know
that that lady

14:12.100 --> 14:13.100
can get along in your world?

14:13.470 --> 14:14.550
All right, all right--
why don't you try

14:15.050 --> 14:16.060
taking her to the
spring dance?

14:16.060 --> 14:17.310
At Arnold's?

14:17.520 --> 14:19.610
Why not? Then at least
you'd find out

14:19.610 --> 14:20.890
whether she's comfortable
or not.

14:21.140 --> 14:22.230
I'll take her to this dance

Oh, there's probably several.

18:17.550 --> 18:19.470
She comes
from a very large family.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.440
Well, uh, this Mr. Prescott...

18:23.440 --> 18:24.890
pays her gas bills.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.360
Could be her father.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.690
Could be her husband.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.270
Hey, hey--
let me ask you a question.

18:29.270 --> 18:30.780
Did you ever see
a ring on her finger?
No.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.060
All right,
what does that mean to you?

18:32.280 --> 18:35.360
She, uh...

18:35.360 --> 18:36.320
She lost it?

18:36.700 --> 18:37.570
Wrong.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.200
It means she ain't married.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.570
Okay, Fonz, if you say so.

18:42.910 --> 18:44.490
That's right, I say so.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.490
Hi.
Hi.

18:47.490 --> 18:50.460
That was really good,
the way you danced.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.000
Thank you.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm going to get back
to the band.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
Yeah, you better do that.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.010
Want to dance?

19:00.510 --> 19:03.010
No, I feel like
sitting here and talking

19:03.010 --> 19:04.010
for just a minute,
all right?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.010
Okay.
Yeah.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.010
What do you want
to talk about?

19:07.010 --> 19:10.020
Well, let's start
with Mr. Prescott.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.850
What would you
like to know?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.990
I'd like to know
if he's your father.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.520
No, Mr. Prescott
is my husband.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.830
Well, then, I'd like to know
if he is your late husband.

19:22.330 --> 19:24.250
No, Mr. Prescott
is very much alive.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.670
Well, then I'd like to know

19:27.670 --> 19:29.620
if he is your
divorced husband.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.450
No.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.960
This is my last shot.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.380
Separated?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.210
Yes.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.550
Yeah.
(chuckles)

19:44.050 --> 19:45.020
I'll tell you something.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.050
You had me going there
for a minute, you know?

19:48.550 --> 19:51.060
Well, my husband
is 4,000 miles away

19:51.060 --> 19:53.560
trying to buy some
oil field or something.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.060
You see, Fonzie,
we have, um...

19:56.060 --> 19:57.560
we have an understanding.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.060
He doesn't tell
and I don't tell.

19:59.570 --> 20:00.570
I call that separated,
wouldn't you?

20:00.980 --> 20:03.370
Whoa, I call that apart.

20:05.150 --> 20:06.150
Well, don't let it bother you.

20:06.660 --> 20:07.410
You're making too much
out of it.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.710
Hey, let me tell you something.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.630
You know, I really like you.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.050
I mean, you're different

20:13.550 --> 20:14.410
from any woman
I've ever known.

20:14.710 --> 20:17.300
For one, you don't giggle.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.300
But, uh...

20:19.300 --> 20:22.300
I got some rules that I live by,
you understand?

20:22.300 --> 20:25.810
And one of them is that I don't
take what ain't mine,

20:25.810 --> 20:27.680
especially wives.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.060
You're serious?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.760
Oh, yeah, I'm serious.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.570
I'd like to talk about it.

20:34.930 --> 20:37.520
I don't see anything
to talk about.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.490
And dig it:
I ain't judging you.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.020
You understand?

20:41.020 --> 20:44.030
But I got my rules, and that's
the way I live my life.

20:44.440 --> 20:48.530
Well, I understand that, and I
also had a similar set of rules,

20:48.530 --> 20:51.450
but as I got older,
I sort of bent them a little.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.250
Whatever.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.960
Why didn't you tell me
that you were married?

20:57.170 --> 20:58.510
You didn't ask.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.290
All right, I didn't ask.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.380
Is that all that's
bothering you?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.050
Fonzie, I...

21:08.050 --> 21:09.550
I think I'm a little different,

21:09.550 --> 21:11.390
and I thought you
were a little different, too.

21:11.690 --> 21:13.610
That's why I never

21:13.860 --> 21:14.860
thought it mattered.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.780
It matters.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.690
I can see that.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.980
I'm sorry,
because I really like you.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.230
I like you, too.

21:28.650 --> 21:30.460
Uh...

21:32.740 --> 21:35.330
I'll just see
myself out.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.330
You're an interesting man.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.330
Yeah?
Yeah.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.840
Promise me you'll
still fix my car?

21:45.840 --> 21:48.340
Oh, yeah, as long
as Aunt Grace picks it up.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.850
I'm glad we met.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.850
I'm very glad we met, too.

21:56.850 --> 22:00.850
Veal Cutlets
Parmigiana for two.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.850
For one.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.860
Bye, Al.

22:10.860 --> 22:14.370
Al, he'll eat
this later.

22:14.870 --> 22:16.870
Women...

22:20.920 --> 22:23.510
Oh, she's married.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.510
She don't wear a ring.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.010
They got an understanding.

22:26.010 --> 22:26.960
We're done.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.220
I... I'm sorry.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.600
Not as much as me, Red.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.610
But listen, you know
what they always say.

22:37.610 --> 22:41.390
It is always darkest
in the middle of the night.

22:45.650 --> 22:47.480
Yeah, I'm going
to remember that.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.200
Yeah, I hope you do.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
Are you leaving now, Fonz?

22:52.540 --> 22:53.540
Hey, what are you, crazy?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.540
Look around this place.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.550
Don't crowd,
don't crowd.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.050
Come here.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.550
Oh, just wait
your turn girls,

23:07.550 --> 23:08.970
just wait your turn;
it's all coming.

on your side of the court.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.370
What do you think
those white lines are for?

23:43.370 --> 23:44.370
Parking spaces?

23:44.370 --> 23:45.370
(Fonzie and Richie chuckle)

Top that one.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.880
Boy, what a game!

23:48.880 --> 23:50.880
We really beat you two.

23:51.380 --> 23:54.050
Boy, did we skunk
you guys, huh?

23:54.050 --> 23:57.640
Now we know who the athletes
in this family are.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.140
Well, we just had
an off day, that's all.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.470
Oh, sure, sure.
FONZIE:
Now, wait a minute.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.060
Wait a minute,
let's be honest here.

24:04.060 --> 24:06.060
You all played very fair.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.860
I believe you were
outclassed by yours truly.

24:10.150 --> 24:12.120
You didn't even play.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.200
Well, I guess you missed me

24:13.200 --> 24:14.790
up in the bleachers
with Loretta.

24:14.790 --> 24:17.210
Is that what all that
cheering was about?

24:17.210 --> 24:18.740
Hey, you bet, Red.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.290
Let me tell you something.

24:22.240 --> 24:26.800
That is still one of America's
favorite pastimes... whoa.

24:29.470 --> 24:32.550
Well, I feel like
I could play another set.

24:32.550 --> 24:33.560
How about you, Howard?

24:33.560 --> 24:35.010
At least,
maybe even a couple.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.590
I don't believe it.

24:36.590 --> 24:39.090
I'm going upstairs and pass out.

24:39.090 --> 24:40.980
Yeah, well don't
do it on the stairs.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.060
I don't think
I can step over you.

24:46.070 --> 24:47.570
Have they gone?
Yeah.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.570
