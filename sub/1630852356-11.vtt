WEBVTT

00:02.047 --> 00:03.916
[Announcer]
Well, I don't believe my eyes!

00:03.917 --> 00:05.086
Bengals star quarterback,

00:05.087 --> 00:07.086
Russell "The Russ Bus" Remington

00:07.087 --> 00:09.466
has just run out of the stadium!

00:09.467 --> 00:11.256
That's right, Bob.
But what in the world

00:11.257 --> 00:13.506
could be more important
than football?

00:13.507 --> 00:14.706
- [nurse] Next.
- [Russ grunting]

00:14.707 --> 00:16.296
- [patient] Whoa!
- [Russ grunting]

00:16.297 --> 00:18.296
Oof! Hey,
Russ Bus, big fan!

00:18.297 --> 00:20.046
Where is he?

00:20.047 --> 00:21.166
Where's my brand-new son?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.047
Shh. He's resting.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.126
Let's see the little punter.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.836
Hey, Remy.

00:27.837 --> 00:29.966
- [Remy coos]
- Incredible!

00:29.967 --> 00:31.327
All right, let's see
what he's got!

00:32.627 --> 00:34.756
Russ, he was just born!

00:34.757 --> 00:36.006
Sweetie, I was
throwin' a tight spiral

00:36.007 --> 00:37.256
when I was 12 minutes old.

00:37.257 --> 00:38.757
Okay, Remy, Daddy's open!

00:39.877 --> 00:40.916
[giggles]

00:40.917 --> 00:42.256
Oh.

00:42.257 --> 00:43.547
[groans]

00:47.297 --> 00:49.296
- [quarterback] Hut!
- [players grunting]

00:49.297 --> 00:51.086
[grunting continues]

00:51.087 --> 00:52.626
Holy smokes, Remy!

00:52.627 --> 00:53.706
I've never seen anyone

00:53.707 --> 00:54.876
so good at a game before.

00:54.877 --> 00:56.706
There's heat
radiatin' off of ya!

00:56.707 --> 00:59.336
It's from
concentration. [grunts]

00:59.337 --> 01:01.876
[game announcer]
Touchdown, boy!

01:01.877 --> 01:03.966
Ooh-wee! You're amazing
at this game.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.086
Not amazing enough.
[grunts]

01:06.087 --> 01:08.086
What's wrong, bud?
Ya feelin' fussy?

01:08.087 --> 01:09.966
No, I'm just under
a lot of pressure.

01:09.967 --> 01:10.967
You know how my dad was, like,

01:10.968 --> 01:13.086
a super famous
pro football player?

01:13.087 --> 01:14.626
Uh, yeah.

01:14.627 --> 01:15.966
For Pete's sake, we're playing

01:15.967 --> 01:17.966
your dad's ding-dang game.

01:17.967 --> 01:20.046
[sighs]
I've tried for years

01:20.047 --> 01:21.966
to impress my dad
with my violin playing,

01:21.967 --> 01:24.966
ballroom dancing,
and puzzle-solving skills.

01:24.967 --> 01:26.916
But the only thing
he cares about is football.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.756
But I have a plan!

01:28.757 --> 01:31.416
You see, today,
I'm enrolled at my dad's--

01:31.417 --> 01:35.006
[grunts] annual...
Oh, uh, the annual

01:35.007 --> 01:38.006
- Lil' Bengals Football Camp!
- [Cricket] A football camp?

01:38.007 --> 01:40.756
I've been preparing for it
by playing this game nonstop.

01:40.757 --> 01:42.296
It's taught me so much
about the sport.

01:42.297 --> 01:43.876
Draw in the linebackers
with a fake,

01:43.877 --> 01:44.877
look off the safety,

01:44.877 --> 01:45.837
hit the tight end on the post,

01:45.838 --> 01:47.166
and... [grunts]

01:47.167 --> 01:49.546
[game announcer]
Touchdown, boy!

01:49.547 --> 01:51.166
Great job, Champ!

01:51.167 --> 01:52.836
I'm proud of ya!

01:52.837 --> 01:54.586
- [whimpering]
- Master Remy.

01:54.587 --> 01:56.126
It's time to leave for camp.

01:56.127 --> 01:57.916
Wish me luck, my friend.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.086
I'll do ya one better
and come along with ya.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.206
- [Remy] Really?
- You're my friend,

02:01.207 --> 02:03.086
and you seem kind of
emotionally fragile.

02:03.087 --> 02:04.506
I've got your back!

02:04.507 --> 02:05.876
[whistle blowing,
players grunting]

02:05.877 --> 02:08.006
[grunting continues]

02:08.007 --> 02:10.046
Hey, Remy,
this thing's pretty sturdy.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.586
I am indestructible!

02:11.587 --> 02:15.086
- [horn blows]
- Welcome, campers, to...

02:15.087 --> 02:18.006
[reading]

02:18.007 --> 02:19.626
Now give it up for your host,

02:19.627 --> 02:21.876
two time Ultra Bowl champion,

02:21.877 --> 02:25.006
Russell The Russ Buss Remington!

02:25.007 --> 02:26.626
Wow.

02:26.627 --> 02:28.126
What do you think
about Cricket and Remy

02:28.127 --> 02:30.876
playing football in the home
of the Big City Bengals?

02:30.877 --> 02:32.376
[slurps]
It's pretty neat.

02:32.377 --> 02:33.796
[Gramma]
It's not neat!

02:33.797 --> 02:35.876
The Greens are Roosters fans!

02:35.877 --> 02:37.626
I can't believe y'all dragged me

02:37.627 --> 02:39.916
into enemy territory!

02:39.917 --> 02:42.006
Roosters rule!
Bengals stink!

02:42.007 --> 02:43.916
Y'all are a bunch of trash bags!

02:43.917 --> 02:46.086
Ma, be civil.
Your grandson
is down there.

02:46.087 --> 02:49.086
- My former grandson.
- Now listen up, kids!

02:49.087 --> 02:50.876
You're here to learn,
and have a good time,

02:50.877 --> 02:53.506
but also to compete
for my approval.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.086
At day's end, I will select

02:55.087 --> 02:56.796
the most worthy
footballer among you

02:56.797 --> 02:59.876
as most valuable player--
Camp MVP!

02:59.877 --> 03:02.006
Biggy the Bengal,
bring out the goods!

03:02.007 --> 03:02.877
[Tilly gasps]

03:02.878 --> 03:04.916
Now, that's a big kitty!

03:04.917 --> 03:07.006
[Russell]
Camp MVP will receive

03:07.007 --> 03:08.756
Russ Bus merchandise,

03:08.757 --> 03:11.336
an autographed copy
of "End Zone Rush,"

03:11.337 --> 03:13.126
and most valuable of all,

03:13.127 --> 03:16.666
my respect
and eternal admiration.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.876
- [kids] Whoa!
- [Remy] That's all
I've ever wanted!

03:19.877 --> 03:21.586
Remy?! What are you doing here?

03:21.587 --> 03:23.506
Hey, Dad, I'm here to play.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.376
I like football!

03:25.377 --> 03:28.006
It's true.
He's a regular
football freak.

03:28.007 --> 03:29.586
Well, block my linebackers.

03:29.587 --> 03:31.086
I thought this day
would never come!

03:31.087 --> 03:32.666
But don't expect
special treatment

03:32.667 --> 03:34.966
- just because
you're my son.
- Bring it on!

03:34.967 --> 03:37.006
Hi! I couldn't
help but notice

03:37.007 --> 03:38.796
that you are a gigantic feline.

03:38.797 --> 03:41.876
- [Biggy] Mm-hmm.
- I have come
to offer you affection.

03:41.877 --> 03:43.506
- Oh... Whoa!
- Come here, now.

03:43.507 --> 03:45.546
[indistinct humming]

03:45.547 --> 03:48.086
Peculiar.
It seems this feline

03:48.087 --> 03:50.506
has never felt the joy
of a good head pat.

03:50.507 --> 03:51.916
I must enlighten him.

03:51.917 --> 03:54.046
After all,
when Tilly sets her mind

03:54.047 --> 03:55.336
to petting a kitty cat,

03:55.337 --> 03:58.006
she's gonna pet that kitty cat.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.376
[Russell] Now,
if you wanna win MVP,

04:00.377 --> 04:02.166
you gotta learn
some basic drills.

04:02.167 --> 04:04.876
Watch and learn!
[Russell grunting]

04:04.877 --> 04:06.086
Ooh, ahh!

04:06.087 --> 04:07.797
Waah-bam!

04:09.587 --> 04:11.586
Ha-ha! Still got it.

04:11.587 --> 04:13.086
With all
that video game
has taught you,

04:13.087 --> 04:14.666
this should be a piece of cake.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.336
Green, you're up.
Let's see what you got.

04:16.337 --> 04:17.966
[Cricket] Time to tote
the big brown bean.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.546
Don't call it that.

04:19.547 --> 04:20.916
- Go, Cricket!
- Traitor!

04:20.917 --> 04:22.336
Touchdown!

04:22.337 --> 04:24.006
[exclaiming, laughing]

04:24.007 --> 04:26.377
[screaming gibberish]

04:27.547 --> 04:28.586
[munching] Hmm?

04:28.587 --> 04:29.836
How'd I do, Coach?

04:29.837 --> 04:30.966
You're fast and agile,

04:30.967 --> 04:33.046
but have no brains whatsoever.

04:33.047 --> 04:35.046
Tough but fair.
Your turn, Remy!

04:35.047 --> 04:36.796
Show your old man
what you can do.

04:36.797 --> 04:39.966
Okay, Remy, just like
in the video game.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.256
Here we go!

04:41.257 --> 04:44.626
Aah! [grunts]
Whoa! [grunts]

04:44.627 --> 04:46.546
A little rusty, but no worries.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.966
- [Remy exclaiming]
- Still feelin' it out.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.546
- [Remy grunting]
- Okay, come on, Remy.

04:49.547 --> 04:51.046
Enough foolin' around!

04:51.047 --> 04:54.206
[Remy screaming, crying]

04:54.207 --> 04:57.006
- [Remy exclaiming]
- [Russell sighs]

04:57.007 --> 04:58.666
What the heck
happened out there?

04:58.667 --> 05:01.666
I don't know!
It's like my brain
knows what to do,

05:01.667 --> 05:04.296
but my doughy little body
just can't do it.

05:04.297 --> 05:07.706
- Coming here was a mistake.
- It's a dang shame!

05:07.707 --> 05:09.466
You'd be unstoppable
if only we could put

05:09.467 --> 05:12.086
your brainful brains
in my brainless body.

05:12.087 --> 05:14.466
[gasps] I know exactly
what we'll do!

05:14.467 --> 05:17.876
- Well, y-you do?
- I... do!

05:17.877 --> 05:19.417
[Tilly]
All right, big kitty.

05:21.757 --> 05:23.296
Let's see if you can resist

05:23.297 --> 05:25.506
the tuneful tune of tuna.

05:25.507 --> 05:27.506
[humming] Huh?

05:27.507 --> 05:29.126
I just wanna give you love!

05:29.127 --> 05:31.046
[Biggy screaming]

05:31.047 --> 05:33.916
[whistle blows]
All right, next up,
the scrimmage.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.836
It's your best chance
to impress me and win MVP.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.336
So don't mess, uh...
What the-- Remy?

05:40.337 --> 05:42.756
[chuckles]
Guess I'm big now.

05:42.757 --> 05:44.466
Whoa, Remy got tall.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.336
Yeah, weirdly tall.

05:46.337 --> 05:48.706
[chuckles] Well, puberty
hit me all at once, too.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.206
Let's see
what you can do with it.

05:50.207 --> 05:52.166
Cricket, are you sure
this is going to work?

05:52.167 --> 05:54.796
I'm 100% confident
this plan is flawless.

05:54.797 --> 05:56.086
- [whistle blows]
- [Russell] All right!

05:56.087 --> 05:58.046
Line up and play ball!

05:58.047 --> 06:00.006
Now, remember, I'm the brains...

06:00.007 --> 06:01.876
And I'm the skittery
little body.

06:01.877 --> 06:03.876
[Remy]
Blue 18, set, hike!

06:03.877 --> 06:05.006
[players grunting]

06:05.007 --> 06:06.796
- Cricket, run!
- Okay!

06:06.797 --> 06:07.966
Whoa!

06:07.967 --> 06:08.967
[Remy screaming]

06:08.968 --> 06:11.586
What in the football world?

06:11.587 --> 06:13.546
Turn, turn!
Not out of bounds!

06:13.547 --> 06:15.376
Hard cut right!
Spin move!

06:15.377 --> 06:18.086
Juke left!
And stop!

06:18.087 --> 06:19.376
[Russell]
I can't believe it!

06:19.377 --> 06:21.006
He scored a touchdown!

06:21.007 --> 06:23.006
- Hike! Throw left!
- [players grunting]

06:23.007 --> 06:24.007
[both grunting]

06:24.008 --> 06:25.836
Ha-ha! Yeah!

06:25.837 --> 06:27.706
Stiff arm, nine o'clock!

06:27.707 --> 06:30.006
- [kid groans]
- [Bill] Whoo!

06:30.007 --> 06:32.086
- [whimpering, screams]
- Come here, you!

06:32.087 --> 06:33.586
[panting]

06:33.587 --> 06:35.166
You're dominating out there!

06:35.167 --> 06:36.966
I think I found my MVP!

06:36.967 --> 06:39.126
Body, wait!
What'd you say, Dad?

06:39.127 --> 06:40.916
- [all grunt]
- [Remy groans]

06:40.917 --> 06:44.007
[slow motion]
Son!

06:45.087 --> 06:48.046
[Biggy grunts]
What? No!

06:48.047 --> 06:50.046
[Remy groans]

06:50.047 --> 06:52.336
[gags] I think
I'm gonna be sick.

06:52.337 --> 06:55.166
Uh... Ow, my legs.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.336
Uh, ow, I'm legs.

06:57.337 --> 06:59.876
Jumpin' Georgia pass,
I can't believe it!

06:59.877 --> 07:01.256
I can't either.

07:01.257 --> 07:03.086
- A deceiver!
- [Biggy] Ugh!

07:03.087 --> 07:05.046
I'm very disappointed, Remy.

07:05.047 --> 07:07.966
And to think I was
gonna name you MVP.

07:07.967 --> 07:10.586
Well, you've got
some learnin' to do,
Mr. Remington.

07:10.587 --> 07:12.836
Remy may not have
all the moves
for this field,

07:12.837 --> 07:14.546
but he's the best
digital quarterback

07:14.547 --> 07:16.006
this side of wherever.

07:16.007 --> 07:17.546
Better than you, I bet!

07:17.547 --> 07:19.206
Uh, Cricket, what are you doing?

07:19.207 --> 07:20.586
No one's gonna be better than me

07:20.587 --> 07:22.006
at my own video game.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.466
You really think
you can take me on, son?

07:24.467 --> 07:25.876
Uh...

07:25.877 --> 07:27.046
Wink.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.796
Yes.
Yes, I do?

07:29.797 --> 07:31.206
[chuckling]
All right, then!

07:31.207 --> 07:32.377
Game on!

07:34.047 --> 07:36.046
Oh, corduroy, Cricket.

07:36.047 --> 07:38.466
If I lose, my dad will
never be proud of me.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.876
Stay cool, man.
This is what you've
been training for.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.166
You've got this.
You're a genius.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.796
- [Remy] Okay!
- We're both geniuses.

07:45.797 --> 07:47.706
-[Bill] Whoo!
Let's go, Remy!
-[Tilly] Whoo! Yeah!

07:47.707 --> 07:49.376
- Yeah, you can do it!
- Yeah, go, Remy!

07:49.377 --> 07:51.626
- [Cricket] Let's do it!
- I hope you both lose.

07:51.627 --> 07:52.837
Go, Roosters!

07:56.967 --> 07:58.626
Just so you know,
I'm not goin' easy on--

07:58.627 --> 07:59.836
- [Remy grunts]
- [game whistle blows]

07:59.837 --> 08:01.966
[game announcer]
Touchdown, boy!

08:01.967 --> 08:03.336
Whoa, how did you do that?

08:03.337 --> 08:05.586
Dad, I play the game
on super hard mode.

08:05.587 --> 08:07.586
Well, son, buckle up
cause I'm puttin'

08:07.587 --> 08:08.966
this bus into high gear.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.546
[chuckles]
Bring it on.

08:10.547 --> 08:13.006
[players grunting, panting]

08:13.007 --> 08:13.917
Ha-ha!

08:13.918 --> 08:15.337
[player grunting]

08:16.337 --> 08:17.377
[both grunt]

08:18.877 --> 08:21.007
- [whistle blows]
- [players grunting]

08:24.587 --> 08:26.586
Excuse me, Papa.
I don't understand

08:26.587 --> 08:28.006
what's happening at all.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.046
Well, sweetie, it's close.

08:29.047 --> 08:30.086
It's the fourth quarter,

08:30.087 --> 08:31.706
and they're neck and neck.

08:31.707 --> 08:32.966
Follow-up question:

08:32.967 --> 08:34.256
Is Remy okay?

08:34.257 --> 08:37.046
- [Remy groaning]
- [Cricket] Oh, no.

08:37.047 --> 08:38.876
He's concentrating
too hard again.

08:38.877 --> 08:40.336
I can feel the heat from here.

08:40.337 --> 08:42.046
Hey, you okay, buddy?

08:42.047 --> 08:43.416
I'm just...

08:43.417 --> 08:45.256
...running hot.
[sighs]

08:45.257 --> 08:46.837
[Cricket] Remy!

08:49.467 --> 08:51.336
Okay, Remy, Daddy's open!

08:51.337 --> 08:52.916
[giggling]

08:52.917 --> 08:55.966
[sighs] Disappointed
in my own baby.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.966
[babbling]

08:57.967 --> 08:59.876
I am no baby!

08:59.877 --> 09:01.126
I am a man!

09:01.127 --> 09:02.466
Oof!

09:02.467 --> 09:04.046
Respect me!

09:04.047 --> 09:06.006
Football!
What happened?

09:06.007 --> 09:07.966
Remy, hurry!
Your dad's about to win!

09:07.967 --> 09:08.967
Get back in the game!

09:09.877 --> 09:11.966
[grunting]

09:11.967 --> 09:14.086
Here comes my winning touchdown!

09:14.087 --> 09:15.706
Think again, maybe!

09:15.707 --> 09:18.966
[all grunting]

09:18.967 --> 09:20.086
[Russell player groaning]

09:20.087 --> 09:21.207
[Russell] Huh?

09:23.087 --> 09:24.916
[game announcer]
Touchdown, boy!

09:24.917 --> 09:26.756
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:26.757 --> 09:28.296
[game crowd cheering]

09:28.297 --> 09:30.166
Ah...

09:30.167 --> 09:31.967
Great job, Champ! I'm--

09:33.467 --> 09:34.666
Huh?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.126
Remy, I don't understand.

09:36.127 --> 09:38.006
How did you beat me
at my own game?

09:38.007 --> 09:39.586
You don't even like football.

09:39.587 --> 09:41.916
- I love football!
- [Russell] Remy.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.336
Why did you come here today?

09:43.337 --> 09:46.296
Well, I... I wanted
to get good at football

09:46.297 --> 09:48.086
- so you'd be impressed.
- [Russell] What?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.666
There are other ways
to impress me than football.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.876
- Dad.
- Maybe you're right.

09:53.877 --> 09:56.206
Remy, I owe you an apology.

09:56.207 --> 09:57.876
Football is my life,

09:57.877 --> 09:59.206
but it shouldn't
have to be yours

09:59.207 --> 10:00.796
if you want my attention.

10:00.797 --> 10:02.006
You're incredible on the violin.

10:02.007 --> 10:04.086
You ballroom dance
like an angel.

10:04.087 --> 10:06.706
And you're much better
than I ever was
at solving puzzles.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.046
Beatin' me
at this video game
doesn't impress me.

10:09.047 --> 10:11.756
You impress me.
Now, I got something

10:11.757 --> 10:13.966
I should've told you
a long time ago.

10:13.967 --> 10:15.966
Oh, my gosh!

10:15.967 --> 10:17.256
[clears throat]

10:17.257 --> 10:20.006
Great job, Champ!
I'm proud of you.

10:20.007 --> 10:22.466
Holy cow!

10:22.467 --> 10:24.336
Thanks, Dad.

10:24.337 --> 10:26.916
- [Cricket whimpering]
- Cricket, are you crying?

10:26.917 --> 10:29.876
No! [sobbing]
