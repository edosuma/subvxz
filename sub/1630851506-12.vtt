WEBVTT

00:05.527 --> 00:06.702
I got in.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.008
Congrats!
You're going to MMI!

00:10.227 --> 00:12.534
<i>Previously on</i> <i>
"A Million Little Things"...</i>

00:12.577 --> 00:14.188
I had feelings for you.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.972
I just didn't realize it
at the time.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.800
I think I was too scared.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.758
It's the perfect night.
I mean, I even managed

00:19.802 --> 00:21.325
to get out of
having to talk to Gary.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.155
- There you are.
- Hmm.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.331
Regina: <i>I had lunch</i> <i>
with my dad.</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:29.551
Uh-oh.
How'd the Ron show go?

00:31.205 --> 00:33.120
You know, I get being friends
with your ex, but...

00:33.163 --> 00:35.644
You have nothing
to worry about.

00:35.687 --> 00:36.906
Oof.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.734
You okay?

00:38.777 --> 00:39.822
Mom?!

00:39.865 --> 00:41.302
<i>Katherine?</i>

00:41.345 --> 00:43.173
I shouldn't have kissed you
in the elevator.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.349
I should have waited
until I broke up with Cam,

00:45.393 --> 00:46.655
which I just did.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.836
Oh!

00:53.879 --> 00:55.316
I think I'm ready
to tap out.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.928
Oh, no, no, no, Bloom,
I've done the math.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.364
We need to have sex
19 times a day,

01:00.408 --> 01:01.496
through next Labor Day.

01:01.539 --> 01:02.540
Then it's like
we never broke up.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.630
After that,
we do a modest three times a day

01:05.674 --> 01:06.675
like an old married couple.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.069
What I'm hearing

01:09.112 --> 01:11.245
is that we're going to be
an old married couple.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.681
We are.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.118
And I look forward to
our matching-outfits phase.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.381
Is that before or after
our cruise-ship phase?

01:17.425 --> 01:18.861
Concurrent.

01:18.904 --> 01:22.908
Matching sailor outfits
on the open seas.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.476
Oh, please stop
eating those.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.174
They're from Cam.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.306
He just keeps sending chocolate
and flowers.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.526
It's like a never-ending
Valentine's Day gift.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.005
I think he's...

01:33.049 --> 01:34.964
hoping we'll get back together.

01:35.007 --> 01:38.141
Either that or he's
fattening you up for the kill.

01:38.185 --> 01:41.666
Which I pretty much deserve,
since I lied to him.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.190
Eh, you didn't lie, exactly.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.063
I mean, I didn't tell him
the whole truth.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.326
I didn't tell him about us.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.459
Then I think you're in
the "little white lie" zone.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.157
And as someone
who's been on the other end

01:54.201 --> 01:55.811
of a difficult breakup
with you,

01:55.854 --> 01:59.423
trust me when I say
you did him a favor.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.034
Have you ever thought about
teaching an ethics class?

02:02.078 --> 02:04.341
'Cause you're a regular
Thomas Aquinas.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.913
That's probably another
flower delivery from Cam.

02:13.655 --> 02:14.786
I have to tell him
the truth.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.096
Do you, though?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.578
Will him knowing about us
really make him feel better?

02:23.621 --> 02:25.928
Or will it make him
hurt more?

02:25.971 --> 02:27.625
Or will it make <i>me</i>
hurt more

02:27.669 --> 02:29.584
because he's gonna want to
kick my ass?

02:29.627 --> 02:32.543
I know I look strong,
but I'm very, very weak.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.241
It's an optical illusion.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.634
Sophie.

02:36.678 --> 02:37.635
I heard about
what happened.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.289
I'm so sorry
about you and Cam.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.944
Wait.
How did you hear about it?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.772
Uh, the whole world
heard about it.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.382
I mean,
after last night's game,

02:45.426 --> 02:46.949
he kinda lost it
to a reporter.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.385
Said he was dealing with
a breakup.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.607
Just know
that I'm here for you.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.217
Okay?
Whatever you need.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.480
But I thought Rocky Road
would be a good start.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.568
Gary: Mmm.

02:57.612 --> 02:58.874
Uh --Please tell me

02:58.917 --> 03:00.223
it's another delivery
of these --

03:05.402 --> 03:07.230
You know what?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.754
It seems like you've got
all the company you need.

03:09.798 --> 03:12.061
Sophie, hey!
Please don't go!

03:12.104 --> 03:13.280
Sophie!

03:22.245 --> 03:23.551
Regina: All right. Tell me
what you guys think of this.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.900
Mm.
Tyrell: Yeah.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.815
Oh, hey!
Take it easy there, champ.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.383
Last thing you wanna do
is slip into a food coma,

03:29.426 --> 03:30.819
fall asleep
like a beached whale

03:30.862 --> 03:31.994
at your big
college interview.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.561
Are you saying my sliders
turn people

03:33.604 --> 03:35.127
into comatose whales?

03:35.171 --> 03:36.433
Nah, he's just trying
to get me

03:36.477 --> 03:38.392
to stop taste-testing
so he can eat mine, too.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.263
Pretty smart kid here.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.091
I think he's gonna ace
this college interview.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.832
Ah.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.052
Dad, I am sorry for booking a
catering gig during your visit.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.358
I mean, you flew
all the way up here --

03:48.402 --> 03:49.664
You kidding me?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.666
I am more than happy
to help you out today.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.842
Just keep paying me
in these free samples.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.192
I knew it was a good idea

03:56.236 --> 03:57.889
to get you that Easy Bake Oven
when you were 4.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.631
Oh, yeah.
That's right, Ron.

04:00.675 --> 04:01.937
I guess we got you
to thank

04:01.980 --> 04:03.330
for everything
Gina's ever done.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.681
Rome, you didn't wear
the Halo Band Dad got you

04:06.724 --> 04:08.639
on your run. Oh.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.467
- I forgot.
- Tyrell: Come on, man!

04:10.511 --> 04:11.903
Team Halo!

04:13.340 --> 04:15.167
This thing
is so cool.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.431
Tracked my sleep last night --
slept like a baby.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.519
Ronald:
What'd I tell you?

04:18.562 --> 04:20.085
Oh, well,
I definitely didn't.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.522
And that makes sense

04:21.565 --> 04:23.263
if you look
at my tone-of-voice data,

04:23.306 --> 04:25.743
which says I have been
sounding stressed lately.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.006
Because I am stressed.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.618
- Hey.
- Come on!

04:30.661 --> 04:32.750
Gots to be quick, Ty.
You gotta be quick, baby.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.317
Oh.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.711
Mmm, mmm.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.017
Don't you have to get dressed
for your interview with Yale?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.932
Yeah, I got two hours
before I need to leave.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.107
Yeah, but I thought
we were gonna do

04:42.151 --> 04:43.674
that mock interview
before you go.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.590
Right.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.463
Hey, kid,
good luck today.

04:49.506 --> 04:50.812
You're gonna do great.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.640
Thanks. Uh...

04:52.683 --> 04:54.294
Little nervous.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.818
I wish my first interview
wasn't also my first choice.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.475
Since when is Yale
your first choice?

05:01.518 --> 05:03.346
We talked about
a bunch of other schools.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.565
Yeah, I know.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.393
What about Hampton?

05:06.436 --> 05:07.742
What about Howard?

05:07.785 --> 05:10.222
Yeah, my mom
shut that down.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.312
She thought I was mispronouncing
"Harvard."

05:14.139 --> 05:16.228
And I didn't end up
applying to either.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.100
I know, I know.
It's just...

05:18.143 --> 05:19.754
my mom worked so hard

05:19.797 --> 05:21.277
to stay in this country
for as long as she could

05:21.321 --> 05:23.105
to make sure that I got
a good education,

05:23.148 --> 05:25.629
and to her,
that means a top-25 school.

05:27.805 --> 05:30.155
What, you can't see me
in a Yale hoodie?

05:30.199 --> 05:31.896
Come on.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.245
How about now?

05:33.289 --> 05:35.726
Tyrell, I want you
to at least check out an HBCU.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.859
Didn't you go to Emerson?

05:37.902 --> 05:40.078
If their Black student
population is over 5%,

05:40.122 --> 05:41.471
I will eat
my future Yale hoodie.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.255
And that's exactly why
I was hoping

05:43.299 --> 05:45.780
you'd at least apply to
a historically Black college.

05:45.823 --> 05:48.348
Look, the application deadlines
have passed,

05:48.391 --> 05:50.872
so I don't even know
why we're talking about this.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.090
Maybe you could
just help me prep

05:52.134 --> 05:53.962
for the interview
I <i>do</i> have?

05:54.005 --> 05:56.834
I want to help, man.
I do.

05:56.878 --> 05:57.835
Good.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.361
Well,
unless you're starting

06:01.404 --> 06:03.711
your clingy college parent,
can't say goodbye thing now,

06:03.754 --> 06:05.887
could you give me a minute?

06:05.930 --> 06:08.019
Oh. Sure.

06:15.984 --> 06:19.204
I always knew you and Maggie
were endgame.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.597
Thank you.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.034
Wish I could say
your sister felt the same.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.993
<i>Don't worry.
She'll come around eventually.</i>

06:25.036 --> 06:26.342
Either that,
or you can go into

06:26.386 --> 06:28.213
the witness protection program.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.128
<i>Ha!</i> <i>
Not a bad idea.</i>

06:30.172 --> 06:31.869
<i>Thanks to cancer,</i> <i>
we already have</i>

06:31.913 --> 06:33.523
<i>an impressive array</i> <i>
of wigs.</i>

06:33.567 --> 06:34.959
Okay.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.483
Well, since your time
might be limited,

06:36.526 --> 06:38.441
I will make this quick.

06:38.485 --> 06:41.401
Milo got his wisdom teeth out,
and we haven't been able

06:41.444 --> 06:43.359
<i>to talk or video chat</i> <i>
in a few days.</i>

06:43.403 --> 06:44.708
Yeah.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.101
I remember
when I got mine out,

06:46.144 --> 06:48.756
my whole face blew up
like a chipmunk.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.323
<i>Can I send you</i> <i>
a list of things</i>

06:51.367 --> 06:53.021
<i>to put in a care package
to take to his house?</i>

06:53.064 --> 06:54.936
All over it, dude.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.416
And can you write out
the card for me?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.026
<i>Well, you're lucky.</i>

06:58.069 --> 06:59.506
<i>I happen to have</i> <i>
very romantic handwriting.</i>

06:59.549 --> 07:00.855
Great.

07:00.898 --> 07:01.899
I'll text you
the list of stuff

07:01.943 --> 07:03.553
and what I want
on the card.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.991
Just sign it,
"Je t'aime, Danny."

07:07.035 --> 07:08.689
Now, my French
may be a little rusty,

07:08.732 --> 07:10.342
but I do understand that.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.648
Hmm?

07:11.692 --> 07:12.736
<i>Thanks, Gary.</i>

07:12.780 --> 07:14.216
Au revoir, Dan Dixon.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.565
<i>Au revoir, mon ami.</i>

07:15.609 --> 07:17.132
Ah.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.569
And just think,

07:19.613 --> 07:20.875
when I graduate
from medical school,

07:20.918 --> 07:22.311
I'll get to wear scrubs,

07:22.354 --> 07:24.139
which are basically
just pajamas.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.270
Med school?

07:25.314 --> 07:26.576
I thought you wanted to be
an astronaut.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.491
That used to be the dream,

07:28.535 --> 07:29.840
but after your trip
to the hospital,

07:29.884 --> 07:31.276
I've changed my mind.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.235
Doctors are way cooler.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.758
Theodore Saville, MD?

07:34.802 --> 07:36.412
Hmm. I like it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.764
So, are you going
into the office today?

07:40.808 --> 07:42.505
Uh, no.
Carter's got that covered.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.941
I get to work from home.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.161
It's one of the perks of
having your own law practice.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.032
Oh.
Now, remember,

07:48.076 --> 07:49.947
you have practice
after school today.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.732
Don't forget your cleats.
They're by the back door.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.429
And I'll be right down
to walk you to the bus.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.604
Okay?

07:54.648 --> 07:56.258
Okay.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.370
Foo Fighters,
"Colour and Shape" tour.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.372
First time I ever had
an all-access pass.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.853
I watched the entire show
from the wings.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.202
And when they finished
their encore,

08:27.245 --> 08:30.031
I saw this beauty
come offstage,

08:30.074 --> 08:33.295
just covered in sweat,
still resonating.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.906
So I asked
if I could just hold it,

08:35.950 --> 08:38.474
and he goes, "It's yours."

08:38.518 --> 08:42.304
No way! Wait,
Dave Grohl gave you that guitar?

08:42.347 --> 08:44.654
Dave Grohl's roadie
gave me this guitar.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.439
Wow.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.051
Eddie, are you really sure
you want me to sell this?

08:50.094 --> 08:51.792
'Cause it's gonna go fast.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.490
It's not like
I'm gonna get back onstage.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.188
Not a lot of guys doing
stadium tours in wheelchairs.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.930
No, just Dave Grohl,

08:59.974 --> 09:03.717
who was in a wheelchair for
half the "Sonic Highways" tour.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.720
And what, just 'cause
I played the violin,

09:06.763 --> 09:09.070
I can't love
the Foo Fighters?

09:09.113 --> 09:13.074
Well, I am no Dave Grohl,
but you're right.

09:13.117 --> 09:16.381
I'm gonna take a minute
to say goodbye.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.610
Nice.
That sounds sweet.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.351
Thanks.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.224
Hey, I know you,
right?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.531
Uh, you ever hear
of the Red Ferns?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.794
No.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.318
Oh, wait!
You're Sophie's guitar teacher.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.972
That's right!

09:42.016 --> 09:43.278
We went to your gig
the other night.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.758
Small world.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.542
Hey, would it be cool
if I put one of our fliers

09:46.586 --> 09:47.543
on your board?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.632
Yeah, go ahead.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.461
Wow! Look at this.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.202
You're going on tour?

09:54.245 --> 09:56.291
20 colleges
from here to Miami.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.032
We're pretty psyched.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.599
My folks always wanted me
to go to Duke.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.775
It's costing them
a lot less this way.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.341
Thanks.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.995
Yeah.

10:09.957 --> 10:13.003
I take it
she didn't tell you?

10:18.052 --> 10:19.793
Danny: <i>Are you sure
you've got everything?</i>

10:19.836 --> 10:22.926
Dude, chillax.
I got this.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.058
<i>Okay.
But do you have the --</i>

10:24.101 --> 10:25.625
Yep.
It's all here.

10:25.668 --> 10:30.194
Got fudge, uh, yogurt tubes
in every available flavor,

10:30.238 --> 10:31.979
and the coup de grace --

10:32.022 --> 10:34.155
an ice tray
with heart-shaped cubes,

10:34.198 --> 10:36.200
so when he presses it
against his cheeks,

10:36.244 --> 10:37.724
he thinks of you.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.334
<i>Awesome.</i> <i>
Call me after.</i>

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
<i>I want you to tell me</i>

10:40.727 --> 10:41.945
<i>exactly what his face</i> <i>
looks like</i>

10:41.989 --> 10:43.120
<i>when you give it to him.</i>

10:43.164 --> 10:45.427
Will do.
Sit tight, Dan Dixon.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.058
<i>Hey, it's Sophie.</i> <i>
Leave it after the --</i>

11:08.102 --> 11:10.495
Hey, Soph, it's me, again.

11:10.539 --> 11:14.325
I just really want to sit down
and talk about this morning.

11:14.369 --> 11:17.459
Um, I understand
if you need more time.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.069
Take as much as you need.

11:19.113 --> 11:22.725
Just know that I love you,
and I'm ready whenever you are.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.340
And while I'm not exactly sure
what my major's gonna be,

11:29.384 --> 11:32.126
I'm really interested in joining
the Yale Film Alliance.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.215
I'd love to connect
with other students

11:34.258 --> 11:36.391
that share my passion
for documentary filmmaking.

11:38.175 --> 11:41.222
Okay, great.
You got the basic answers down.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.833
Now let's make sure we got
a few questions for them.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.141
Okay. Um...

11:47.184 --> 11:49.796
How does the university
foster relationships

11:49.839 --> 11:51.711
between seniors
and the alumni?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.496
No,
y-you're playing softball, okay?

11:54.539 --> 11:56.193
What you should ask them is,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.369
how many students of color
get hired upon graduation,

11:58.413 --> 11:59.849
or ever?

11:59.893 --> 12:01.764
Actually, Ty, in an interview,
you either want to be

12:01.808 --> 12:03.461
interesting or interested,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.550
and that question
screamed interested,

12:05.594 --> 12:06.987
and that's great.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.119
What you need to ask them is
what reporting mechanisms

12:09.163 --> 12:11.252
do they have in place
for incidents of racism?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.080
Yeah, sure, and then,
in the fall,

12:13.123 --> 12:14.559
you can tell
all your friends about it

12:14.603 --> 12:17.519
at community college.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.042
I'm just trying to work
with him here. Do you mind?

12:19.086 --> 12:21.262
Of course.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.046
Regina's waiting for me.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.922
Okay, seriously,
what's your problem?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.793
What are the demographics
at your school?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.273
You know this --
it's mostly Black.

12:32.316 --> 12:35.145
Exactly. You're used to having
a big community.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.538
Yeah, but the real world
isn't like that,

12:36.581 --> 12:39.149
and college is supposed to
prepare you for life.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.456
All the more reason
to have four years at a school

12:41.499 --> 12:43.327
that will help you fortify
that sense of self

12:43.371 --> 12:45.199
before stepping into
the real world.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.766
You don't think
I can handle Yale.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.984
That's not
what I'm saying.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.117
That's <i>exactly</i>
what you're saying.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.640
You know what?
It's almost time for me to go.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.773
I'll finish up on my own.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.085
I mean, I'm happy to look over
your divorce papers,

13:02.129 --> 13:04.348
but I don't think that
my professional advice

13:04.392 --> 13:05.828
will really be
of much service

13:05.872 --> 13:07.917
in your custody battle
for Patti LaFur.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.397
Not with that attitude.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.486
Ah, I love that cat.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.185
Wait. What are --
What are you doing?

13:15.229 --> 13:17.666
Hiding
our takeout containers?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.624
Are you ashamed of how much
styrofoam we just used,

13:19.668 --> 13:22.018
or...am I
your dirty little secret?

13:23.063 --> 13:24.151
Theo's just...

13:24.194 --> 13:26.283
gone through
so much change lately.

13:26.327 --> 13:30.374
I need to find the right time
to tell him about us.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.811
I totally understand.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.769
Theo has to be
your first priority.

13:35.553 --> 13:40.167
You know, maybe I will represent
you and Patti LaFur.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.094
May I see you in your chambers,
counselor?

13:54.137 --> 13:57.140
You can use my billable hours
however you want.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.968
Ooh!

13:59.012 --> 14:02.276
I can't believe I burned
an entire tray of meatballs.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.407
I'm really gonna need you

14:03.451 --> 14:04.844
to push the sliders
with the guests.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.454
Push them, not eat them.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.021
Noted.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.197
You can count on me.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.851
Thanks, Dad.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.156
I don't know
how I'm gonna keep doing this.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.855
I was delusional

14:15.898 --> 14:17.987
thinking Val and I
could handle this size job

14:18.031 --> 14:19.946
out of our tiny kitchens.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.470
Why don't you rent
a professional space,

14:22.513 --> 14:24.428
take the stress
out of your home?

14:24.472 --> 14:25.777
After two
failed restaurants,

14:25.821 --> 14:28.519
no bank is gonna give me
a loan.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.912
Can you get the plates?

14:31.218 --> 14:34.917
How about
the International Bank of Dad?

14:34.961 --> 14:36.832
I'll give you the money.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.357
I've tasted your food.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.011
I've seen you work.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.796
You are a great,
great investment, Gigi.

14:46.624 --> 14:50.063
That's really generous
of you, Dad.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.154
Yeah, let -- let me and Rome
talk about it.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.808
Well, we both know
what his answer's gonna be.

14:56.852 --> 14:57.897
Dad.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.508
He's still holding a grudge

15:00.551 --> 15:03.119
because I gave away
the leftover cake
after your wedding.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.512
Yeah, well,
we didn't have a slice

15:04.555 --> 15:06.253
to thaw out
for our anniversary.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.952
Which is why I replaced it
with a three-tier cake

15:09.996 --> 15:12.563
from the best bakery
in Boston, huh?

15:12.607 --> 15:15.392
Well, that's Rome's issue
with you.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.785
What is?

15:18.134 --> 15:21.311
He feels that you show up
with your -- your wallet

15:21.355 --> 15:22.922
and -- and not much else.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.926
Why didn't you tell me this?

15:29.102 --> 15:30.407
'Cause I-I didn't want to
give you another reason

15:30.451 --> 15:32.366
to stay away.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.242
Hi.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.809
Hey.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.899
Come on in.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.859
Wow.
What's going on here?

15:47.903 --> 15:50.688
Uh, well, we lost
our rehearsal space.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.168
And then I realized,
until the house sells,

15:52.212 --> 15:53.778
I've got this.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.216
Turns out the acoustics in here
are actually pretty good.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.914
- What's up?
- I heard about your tour.

16:01.177 --> 16:04.180
Yeah,
I...was gonna tell you.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.313
How's that gonna work
with your class schedule?

16:06.356 --> 16:08.837
It's not.
I told MMI I'm not going.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.448
You mean
until next semester?

16:11.492 --> 16:12.754
No, I mean, at all.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.799
I told them to give my slot
to someone else.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.976
Are you kidding me?
Soph...

16:17.019 --> 16:18.194
that is everything
we worked for.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.153
I know, but it took
me getting into MMI

16:20.196 --> 16:22.764
to know that that's just not
the right path for me.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.114
And this is? Hmm?

16:25.158 --> 16:27.725
Going on tour with a garage band
you joined five minutes ago?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.901
Why should I go to school
for four years

16:29.945 --> 16:31.729
to do something
I could just do right now?

16:31.773 --> 16:33.340
So that when
the touring stops,

16:33.383 --> 16:36.386
you can actually get a job
or teach at a great school.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.040
You can't do any of that
without college.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.173
Yeah, says the guy
who didn't go to college.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.653
Yeah, says the guy
who's driving a rideshare, Soph.

16:42.697 --> 16:43.480
Does your mom know
about this?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.134
Oh, my mom?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.483
Yeah, who's reliving
her youth

16:46.527 --> 16:47.615
on a permanent tour
of France?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.051
You know, why is it

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
that all of the adults
in my life

16:50.400 --> 16:51.967
get to do whatever the hell
that they want,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.665
but somehow I'm the one who's
expected to be responsible?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.711
You know,
I-I thought you, of all people,

16:56.754 --> 16:58.365
would be excited for me,

16:58.408 --> 16:59.583
but you obviously don't think
we're good enough.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.324
I don't, because "good enough"
isn't enough.

17:01.368 --> 17:02.499
To make it,
you have to be great.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.892
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.938
Morgan:
Hey, Sophie, we're here!

17:06.982 --> 17:10.246
Well, you can say
what you want,

17:10.290 --> 17:12.335
but I'm going to
bet on myself.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.734
Hey, guys.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.605
What's up?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.000
Soph, please.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.567
I just need you
to rethink this.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.308
And I need you to leave.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.613
It's time for us
to rehearse,

17:29.657 --> 17:30.701
which you just made
really clear

17:30.745 --> 17:31.963
we need
a whole lot more of.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.107
Oh, my God.
What did you tell Danny?

17:45.151 --> 17:46.108
I panicked.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.632
I told him I dropped off
the basket

17:48.676 --> 17:49.633
and never saw Milo.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.331
<i>Uh, quick question.</i>

17:51.374 --> 17:52.897
<i>Is that still in the
"little white lie" zone?</i>

17:52.941 --> 17:54.725
<i>'Cause it seems more like</i> <i>
a "big fat lie."</i>

17:54.769 --> 17:56.379
Oh, come on.
This is different.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.165
Feels like
the same kind of awful to me.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.080
<i>Maybe.</i> <i>
All I know is,</i>

18:01.123 --> 18:02.907
at some point,
this is gonna blow up.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.735
And instead of being
the messenger

18:04.779 --> 18:06.346
who breaks Danny's heart,

18:06.389 --> 18:08.304
I can be the person who
helps him pick up the pieces.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.439
Hold on.
Someone's at the door.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.140
Cam. Hey.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.576
Wait, Cam is there?

18:27.062 --> 18:29.804
Uh...come in, dude, please.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.197
Cam: We need to talk.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.591
Okay.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.030
I need you to help me
get Maggie back.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.735
Hey, Rome.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.000
Back already?

18:52.043 --> 18:54.916
Yeah. Regina forgot
the tiramisu.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.881
Figures.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.102
You okay?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.410
Look at this.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.454
It's a website
that breaks down

19:11.498 --> 19:13.064
the diversity
of the Ivy League.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.718
Check out the stats
for Yale.

19:16.198 --> 19:20.333
Black students only make up
8.4% of the student body.

19:20.376 --> 19:21.769
Tell me
that's not ridiculous.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.428
I feel like
I overstepped earlier.

19:30.038 --> 19:33.520
You know Tyrell
way better than I do.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.086
I'm sure you know
what's best for him.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.305
I do.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.702
You're protective of him.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.921
And Gina, too.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.314
And as far as I'm concerned,

19:45.358 --> 19:47.273
that is
the most important quality

19:47.316 --> 19:49.579
to have in a son-in-law.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.538
But let me give you
a little advice,

19:51.581 --> 19:54.062
from one dad to another.

19:54.105 --> 19:57.283
No matter where Tyrell
ends up going,

19:57.326 --> 19:59.807
just make sure you give him
a reason to come back.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.766
You don't want to end up my age,
trying to make up

20:02.810 --> 20:05.595
for too many decades
of lost time.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.258
Okay.
Then what did she say?

20:16.302 --> 20:18.652
She said,
"I'm gonna bet on myself."

20:18.695 --> 20:21.045
We're not at the blackjack
tables in Vegas.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.091
This is her life
we're talking about.

20:23.134 --> 20:26.573
Eddie
that may be on me.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.879
I'm the one who told her
to bet on herself.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.055
She came to see me
when she got into MMI,

20:31.099 --> 20:34.015
but she didn't know
that I went there.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.496
Maybe seeing
how I parlayed my degree

20:36.539 --> 20:39.281
into a super-impressive career
in retail

20:39.325 --> 20:41.240
gave her second thoughts.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.201
She doesn't know
what she's in for.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.682
What's she gonna do
at 2:00 a.m. in Myrtle Beach

20:48.725 --> 20:50.249
when the promoter
stiffed the band,

20:50.292 --> 20:52.555
they have no place to stay,
no money for gas?

20:52.599 --> 20:55.210
But Sophie is not you.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.907
And just because
she's going on the road,

20:56.951 --> 21:00.302
it doesn't mean
that she's gonna hit
all the same potholes.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.825
I mean,
I stayed in school,

21:01.869 --> 21:04.219
but I also found my own way
of self-sabotaging

21:04.263 --> 21:09.529
by
listening to a guy...

21:09.572 --> 21:11.705
who told me
I wasn't good enough.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.970
I may have said exactly that
to Sophie.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.891
If I could get her
to see clearly,

21:23.934 --> 21:25.022
you know,
I think she'll realize

21:25.066 --> 21:26.328
that we are perfect
for each other.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.112
Gary, come on.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.157
You're her best friend.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.290
You know her better
than anyone.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.249
Is there anything I could say
or do to get her back?

21:34.293 --> 21:38.340
Look, all I know
is that you're Cam Lam,

21:38.384 --> 21:41.343
the one and only.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.867
No matter what happens,
you're gonna be okay.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.392
You just gotta
get back out there, man.

21:46.435 --> 21:49.264
I'm sure
there are plenty of --

21:57.228 --> 21:59.622
I really want you to tell me
you got those yourself

21:59.666 --> 22:01.320
from the chocolatier
on Newbury Street.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.889
Still or sparkling?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.456
Katherine:
Uh, sparkling!

22:14.681 --> 22:16.726
Who are you?

22:16.770 --> 22:18.075
I'm Greta.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.521
Theo, what are you
doing home?

22:28.564 --> 22:29.609
You have soccer practice.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.828
I feel sick, so I got on
the early bus.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.134
I didn't want to
bother you

22:33.177 --> 22:34.831
because I know
you had work to do.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.357
Are you the Greta
from the phone call?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.881
Yes, I am.

22:40.924 --> 22:44.624
She came by for lunch,
but she was just leaving.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.582
Hold on, T,
I need a thermometer.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.888
Greta, I'll call you
later tonight?

22:47.931 --> 22:49.368
Sorry.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.721
Wait, don't go.
Y-You should stay.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.072
I know it sucks being sick,
but I have a hunch

22:58.115 --> 22:59.856
your mom is the best nurse
in town.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.292
Yeah.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.817
Mom?!

23:03.860 --> 23:04.818
Katherine: I'm okay!

23:04.861 --> 23:07.168
Just knocked over
the vacuum!

23:14.871 --> 23:17.265
Hey, Theo,
you know...

23:19.485 --> 23:22.357
I am so glad
it was you

23:22.401 --> 23:23.924
at the other end of the phone
that night.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.796
You handled it
like a pro.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.017
No, I didn't.
Her head was bleeding.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.714
If you hadn't been on
the phone...

23:31.758 --> 23:33.890
Oh, what are
you talking about?

23:33.934 --> 23:35.326
You did great.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.242
You have natural instincts,
and you trusted them.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.157
You really think so?

23:40.201 --> 23:41.420
Absolutely.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.598
Found it.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.557
Greta,
you're still here.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.430
Yeah.
I cannot find my car keys.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.390
Do you mind, uh,
helping me look?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.523
Uh, yeah.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.704
Eddie: I knocked,
but you didn't hear me.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.227
What do you want now?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.534
To apologize
for being an ass.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.059
And...

24:12.102 --> 24:13.713
to give you this.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.502
Wait.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.852
Isn't this the one you got
from Dave Grohl's roadie?

24:22.896 --> 24:24.767
I took it
on my first tour.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.203
Now you'll take it
on yours.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.988
As long as you promise
not to smash it.

24:34.821 --> 24:35.952
I think I got
a little confused

24:35.996 --> 24:37.388
about whose life
we were talking about.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.349
You deserve
to live your own.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.525
You don't need my blessing
or anyone else's to do that.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.224
Thank you.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.360
By the way,

24:52.403 --> 24:54.536
you are great enough
to make it.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.540
<i>Way</i> better than I was
at your age.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.063
You really think so?

25:00.107 --> 25:02.065
I do.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.590
And I think about
what you have right now,

25:04.633 --> 25:07.549
your whole life
in front of you,

25:07.593 --> 25:09.769
all the amazing songs
you've yet to write,

25:09.812 --> 25:13.555
and now all the shows
you're gonna play.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.991
Makes me a little jealous.

25:25.698 --> 25:26.699
What are you doing?

25:26.742 --> 25:27.917
I'm not taking this with me

25:27.961 --> 25:29.310
because you are not done
with it.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.487
Sophie, I'm not a rock star anymore.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.794
You are still
a rock star to me.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.233
And when I get back,
I want to hear you play that.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.498
Hey.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.154
Have a great tour.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.809
I will.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.378
Be right up, T.

25:54.422 --> 25:55.858
What's going on?

25:55.902 --> 25:57.425
I don't think Theo's sick.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.035
You think he's faking?

25:59.079 --> 26:00.297
He likes school
more than candy.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.301
I think the other night,
when you passed out,

26:04.345 --> 26:06.565
it was really scary
for him.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.349
Like, <i>really</i> scary.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.959
I mean, he was talking about
you bleeding from your head

26:10.003 --> 26:12.309
and not knowing
what to do.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.877
Oh, my God.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.619
That's why he wants
to be an ER doctor --

26:17.663 --> 26:19.316
to protect me.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.232
Do you remember
in fourth grade

26:22.276 --> 26:24.670
when Crystal Myers pushed you
off the tire swing?

26:24.713 --> 26:26.106
You landed on your wrist.

26:26.149 --> 26:29.196
Oh, my God, yes.
My wrist hurt so badly.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.198
Yeah, but you didn't want to
make a big deal about it

26:31.241 --> 26:33.374
because your sister
had that piano recital.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.594
I couldn't be the reason
the entire family wasn't there.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.291
You put on a brave face,

26:37.334 --> 26:38.771
and it wasn't till later
when your mom

26:38.814 --> 26:40.990
noticed your wrist was swollen
to twice its normal size

26:41.034 --> 26:43.384
that you went to
the hospital.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.952
You just wanted everyone
to be okay,

26:45.995 --> 26:47.257
no matter what that meant
for you.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.697
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.309
He's doing it
because he loves you.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.834
You just have to
talk to him about it.

27:01.489 --> 27:05.449
I think Patti LaFur lucked out
having you as a mom.

27:05.493 --> 27:08.496
Katherine,
you're already on retainer.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.890
No need to butter me up.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.854
He knows.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.383
I can't believe
I didn't see it.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.559
The trip to Albany,

27:28.603 --> 27:31.258
Gary staying with you
that night with Colin.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.347
I'm so stupid.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.827
Maggie:
No, you're not stupid.

27:34.870 --> 27:38.439
Uh... I should've told you
the whole truth.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.006
Gary: I'm gonna
give you guys a minute.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.140
You told me I had nothing
to worry about with him.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.714
When I said that,
it was true.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.456
I don't get it.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.631
How did this happen?

27:58.546 --> 28:01.636
Little by little.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.465
And...

28:04.508 --> 28:06.293
then all of a sudden.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.905
I-It was a surprise
to me, too.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.690
I-I should have been
honest with you.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.136
Danny: <i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Danny.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.311
<i>You know</i> <i>
I'm in France, right?</i>

28:24.354 --> 28:28.271
I know.
I know it's late, but, uh...

28:28.315 --> 28:29.795
Can you talk?

28:50.685 --> 28:52.426
Hey.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.515
How'd it go?

28:54.558 --> 28:58.171
Well, uh...

28:58.214 --> 28:59.868
I asked a question
you would've liked.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.785
"What diversity initiatives
do you have on campus

29:03.829 --> 29:05.874
to combat
racial discrimination

29:05.918 --> 29:08.834
at all levels
of the institution?"

29:08.877 --> 29:11.053
I believe
I owe you an apology.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.663
Uh, no, you don't.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.578
No, actually, I do.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.233
I need to tell you something.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.585
Rome, what?

29:22.848 --> 29:24.719
Between my sophomore
and junior year of high school,

29:24.763 --> 29:26.721
my dad pulled some strings

29:26.765 --> 29:29.637
with one of the owners
of the Celtics

29:29.680 --> 29:31.857
to get me into Sussex Prep.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.380
That private school?

29:34.947 --> 29:36.078
I didn't know
you went there.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.298
Yeah.

29:38.341 --> 29:41.518
I don't like
to talk about it much.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.259
I got a great education.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.654
It's just that, you know, I had
a horrible experience there.

29:46.697 --> 29:50.527
It was tough being one
of only a couple Black students.

29:50.571 --> 29:52.834
I guess you applying
to these schools

29:52.878 --> 29:55.097
kind of brought that
back up for me.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.667
I'm really sorry
that I let my own baggage

29:59.710 --> 30:01.364
get in the way
of your opportunity.

30:02.975 --> 30:03.976
You didn't.

30:07.196 --> 30:11.722
In fact, the guy said
my essay

30:11.766 --> 30:14.900
was the main reason I was
getting a look at Yale.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.864
And I like my chances.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.013
Cool as a cucumber.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.971
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.451
Me too.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.888
But I don't know why they say
"cool as a cucumber."

30:46.932 --> 30:49.456
I mean, isn't a cucumber
just always room temperature

30:49.499 --> 30:50.457
unless it's in a fridge?

30:54.026 --> 30:56.245
Uh, T, you know,
Greta said that she thought

30:56.289 --> 30:58.639
maybe you were
still thinking a lot

30:58.682 --> 30:59.901
about what happened to me
the other night.

31:01.772 --> 31:05.820
Is there anything you want to
talk to me about?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.648
I don't know.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.955
It's just...

31:09.998 --> 31:12.131
what if I had been at Dad's
that night?

31:12.174 --> 31:14.785
You would've been
all alone.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.049
That's why you came home early,
isn't it?

31:17.092 --> 31:18.746
So I wouldn't be
by myself?

31:24.143 --> 31:26.493
I'm gonna be okay.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.756
You were really brave
the other night.

31:28.799 --> 31:33.282
You did all the right things,
even though you were scared.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.807
Greta said
I have good instincts.

31:36.851 --> 31:39.810
That is so true.

31:39.854 --> 31:42.596
You know, if she's around more,
that's okay with me.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.467
Yeah?

31:44.511 --> 31:47.557
I like her.
And you do, too, right?

31:47.601 --> 31:51.431
Well, sure. She's, um --

31:51.474 --> 31:54.390
She's been my friend, uh,

31:54.434 --> 31:57.219
since before we were your age,
and that's a long --

31:57.263 --> 31:59.656
But she's more than
a friend now, isn't she?

32:01.876 --> 32:04.487
Is this
because of my perfume?

32:04.531 --> 32:06.794
I can just tell, Mom.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.014
You seem...different.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.537
You've been smiling a lot.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.893
Okay.
Well...you're right.

32:21.287 --> 32:24.029
We are more than friends.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.335
How do you feel
about that?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.774
I'm really glad
someone's looking out for you.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.561
Me too.

32:38.130 --> 32:41.002
How about I stay here
until you fall asleep?

32:41.046 --> 32:42.221
I'd like that. Okay.

32:46.790 --> 32:47.966
Okay. Comfy?

32:48.009 --> 32:49.445
Mm-hmm.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.328
Thanks for your help
today, Dad.

33:02.371 --> 33:03.894
Uh-huh.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.550
Hey, I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings

33:07.594 --> 33:10.336
with what I said before.

33:10.379 --> 33:13.600
I just wanted you to know
where Rome was coming from.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.428
No, I get it.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.996
Sometimes I do lead
with my bank account.

33:19.823 --> 33:22.826
Yeah, about that offer...

33:22.870 --> 33:24.872
You don't have to explain.
It's okay.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.614
I accept.

33:27.657 --> 33:30.225
With one stipulation.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.836
If I'm going to start
this business,

33:32.880 --> 33:35.448
I don't just want
your money.

33:35.491 --> 33:36.797
I want you.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.233
You said yourself

33:38.277 --> 33:40.409
you had some time
before your next project.

33:40.453 --> 33:44.196
And today felt so good
having you there by my side

33:44.239 --> 33:48.896
that if I'm really
gonna do this again,

33:48.939 --> 33:52.030
that's what I need
from you most of all.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.379
Well, that and your money.

33:56.730 --> 34:01.778
Nothing would make me happier
than us working together.

34:09.351 --> 34:13.181
Well, I had to watch
Danny's poor little heart

34:13.225 --> 34:14.139
break in real time.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.532
Oh.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.969
It was pretty brutal.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.102
I'm so sorry.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.191
How'd you leave it
with Cam?

34:25.976 --> 34:27.891
He just gave me a hug

34:27.935 --> 34:31.547
and told me all he really wants
is for me to be happy.

34:31.591 --> 34:35.725
Can I just say that
that guy is a damn saint?

34:35.769 --> 34:36.813
He is.

34:42.863 --> 34:44.517
You're sure about us,
right?

34:46.649 --> 34:47.998
You don't need to rethink

34:48.042 --> 34:52.786
the whole you and me
being together again thing?

34:52.829 --> 34:55.354
Because...

34:55.397 --> 34:57.312
Cam is perfect.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.621
Yeah, you're right.
He is perfect.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.365
But I'm not.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.063
And you're not. No.

35:11.326 --> 35:14.112
Yet somehow,
we are perfect together.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.377
Yeah.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.596
I guess we do
deserve each other, then.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.425
You know,
when I told you

35:23.469 --> 35:27.125
about what really happened
with Peter,

35:27.168 --> 35:28.778
you were the only person
that knew

35:28.822 --> 35:31.868
I wasn't capable
of doing that to him.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.697
You didn't even need
to ask.

35:34.741 --> 35:37.222
Because I know you.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.745
Well, I know <i>you.</i>

35:40.790 --> 35:42.314
And I love you.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.623
And I missed you.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.193
From now on, it's you and me
against the world.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.943
We only need to have sex
18 more times today

36:02.986 --> 36:04.423
to stay on track.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.390
Oh, come on.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.655
As thrilled as I am
that you two are back together,

36:19.699 --> 36:21.744
could you get a room?

36:21.788 --> 36:23.050
There's one
just down the hall.

36:24.530 --> 36:25.748
Ooh, what is this?

36:25.792 --> 36:28.142
Are you, uh,
serenading us tonight?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.231
I think I'd rather
listen to you kiss again.

36:31.885 --> 36:35.149
Yeah, I was trying to
give this bad boy to Sophie

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
for her tour.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.761
She's leaving tonight.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.911
Rome, what's going on?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.001
You okay?

37:04.918 --> 37:06.963
It's Tyrell's
college essay.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.620
It's about me.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.191
"The word that has shifted
the most in meaning for me

37:17.235 --> 37:18.888
is the word 'father.'

37:22.109 --> 37:25.199
I once thought that
it was purely biological,

37:25.243 --> 37:27.723
a matter of DNA --

37:27.767 --> 37:32.162
a connection formed
with little choice or input.

37:32.206 --> 37:37.255
But Rome Howard showed me
that I was completely wrong.

37:37.298 --> 37:42.434
Sometimes, someone chooses to
change your life forever."

37:45.741 --> 37:48.266
Rome: <i>"He supports me</i> <i>
emotionally when I'm happy,</i>

37:48.309 --> 37:49.963
<i>when I'm sad, and..."</i>

37:50.006 --> 37:52.052
Tyrell: <i>And when I'm all</i> <i>
the things in-between.</i>

37:57.100 --> 37:59.015
Love you, Mom.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.368
I love you, T.

38:07.502 --> 38:10.157
<i>He chooses to see me</i> <i>
as the best version of myself</i>

38:10.200 --> 38:12.290
<i>and pushes me</i> <i>
until I have no choice</i>

38:12.333 --> 38:13.900
<i>but to believe it, too.</i>

38:18.121 --> 38:20.210
<i>He showed me that even</i> <i>
on the hardest days,</i>

38:20.254 --> 38:22.952
<i>I should keep fighting because</i> <i>
sorrow isn't permanent</i>

38:22.996 --> 38:26.391
<i>and bad days end, no matter</i> <i>
how terrible they feel.</i>

38:26.434 --> 38:27.914
Security guard: Hey, let's go
see if he's free right now.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.265
Hey, Cam Lam.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.572
This is my nephew, Logan.
Can he, uh, get a picture?

38:35.269 --> 38:36.270
Only if I can be in it.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.882
What's up, man?
All right.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.493
Here we go. Thanks.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.060
All right.
Go B's on three.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.367
1, 2, 3.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.459
<i>And even though I know
that there are many more things</i>

38:51.503 --> 38:52.808
<i>I'll learn from him,</i>

38:52.852 --> 38:54.984
<i>the most important lesson</i> <i>
thus far</i>

38:55.028 --> 38:57.857
<i>has been that relationships</i> <i>
of all kinds are gifts</i>

38:57.900 --> 38:59.685
<i>and have to be handled</i> <i>
with care.</i>

39:02.122 --> 39:04.820
Eddie told me
you were leaving on tour.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.823
I didn't want you to leave
without saying goodbye.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.827
How can you be with him?

39:11.871 --> 39:13.438
After what he did,

39:13.481 --> 39:15.614
after knowing
what he's capable of?

39:15.657 --> 39:17.180
I'm not gonna judge him

39:17.224 --> 39:19.400
by the worst day
he's ever had.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.315
Yeah, well,
that worst day showed me

39:21.359 --> 39:23.361
he is capable of making
a split-second decision

39:23.404 --> 39:25.232
that hurts me
and everyone around him.

39:27.234 --> 39:30.716
So I'm sorry,
but I don't trust Gary anymore,

39:30.759 --> 39:32.239
and, honestly,
I'm not sure I ever will.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.378
When I tried to give up
on myself,

39:40.421 --> 39:43.685
Gary wouldn't let me.

39:43.729 --> 39:46.775
He fought for me every second,

39:46.819 --> 39:51.345
even when I lost the will
to fight for myself.

39:54.566 --> 39:57.264
Someday, I hope you find
somebody like that,

39:57.307 --> 40:00.223
a person...

40:00.267 --> 40:01.442
you can't be without,

40:01.486 --> 40:04.837
a person you can't
stop loving.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.798
And when that happens,

40:09.842 --> 40:12.497
you'll understand
why I have to be with Gary.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.939
Hey, Sophie.
Sorry, but we gotta roll.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.506
- It's getting late.
- Yeah.

40:25.118 --> 40:27.076
Well, my mom was right
about one thing.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.298
It's time to get the hell
out of here.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.707
<i>Fathers come in many forms,</i>

40:48.750 --> 40:51.013
<i>and I'm sure the definition</i> <i>
will continue to expand,</i>

40:51.057 --> 40:53.929
<i>but for me...</i>

40:53.973 --> 40:56.845
<i>...no matter what, I know I can</i> <i>
always lean on mine.</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:00.980
<i>And he'll always</i> <i>
be there for me.</i>

41:12.731 --> 41:15.124
Okay, okay.

41:24.394 --> 41:25.483
Dan Dixon.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.964
What are you doing here?

41:29.008 --> 41:31.097
I'm here to get Milo back.
