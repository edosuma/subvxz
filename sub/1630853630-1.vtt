Trash. Junk. Trash.

00:43.916 --> 00:44.916
Ooh!

00:45.250 --> 00:46.250
More trash.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.333
Huh?

00:47.750 --> 00:49.125
Aw, <i>itai!</i> Aw! (GROANS IN PAIN)

00:50.750 --> 00:52.833
Pain. My old friend.

BAYMAX: Hello.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.375
Kiko.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.208
Hey!

01:06.458 --> 01:08.750
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare...

01:08.833 --> 01:10.291
What's that? Borax?

01:12.625 --> 01:16.083
I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.500
I was alerted to the need
for medical attention when you said...

01:19.583 --> 01:21.583
-"Aw, <i>itai!</i> Aw!"
-Wasn't me.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.666
On a scale of 1-10,
how would you rate your pain?

01:24.750 --> 01:27.083
I love all my pain equally.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.041
-That is not a valid answer.
-(SIGHS)

01:29.125 --> 01:30.416
-I will scan you now.
-Huh?

01:30.500 --> 01:31.500
Scan me?

01:32.166 --> 01:35.833
Scan complete. There is degradation
of your joint cartilage,

01:35.916 --> 01:38.000
primarily affecting the area of your hips.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.541
Compliments will get you nowhere.

01:39.625 --> 01:43.666
I suggest pain medication
in conjunction with daily exercise.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.958
I will find the nearest
recreational facility,

01:46.041 --> 01:48.166
using my state-of-the-art GPS locate...

01:48.250 --> 01:49.250
Found it.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.666
Swimming is an ideal form of
physical therapy for someone with your...

01:52.750 --> 01:53.750
I don't swim.

01:56.875 --> 02:00.708
BAYMAX: It can be more encouraging
to swim with a friend or family member.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.708
Great, I'll call everyone I know.
(GRUNTING)

02:02.791 --> 02:06.708
I detected a spike in your cortisol level
when I mentioned swimming.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.416
Do you have a fear of water?

02:08.500 --> 02:09.500
You got it.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.625
Then we first must address
your water phobia.

02:11.708 --> 02:14.875
I will implement a psychological
treatment called "exposure."

02:14.958 --> 02:16.333
I'm trying to slam the door.

02:16.416 --> 02:18.708
Slowly introducing you
to elements you fear

02:18.791 --> 02:20.375
until you are comfortable swimming.

02:52.583 --> 02:56.125
You have taken your first step
in overcoming your fear of water.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.166
You have taken a major step
in facing your fear.

05:09.833 --> 05:10.833
Oh, no.

05:11.666 --> 05:14.041
No. You shouldn't have brought me here.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.416
I need to go home.

05:27.083 --> 05:28.166
You don't understand.

05:29.666 --> 05:31.416
I was never afraid of water.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.666
It's this place.

05:35.916 --> 05:36.916

05:39.125 --> 05:41.500
Look at my ridiculous husband.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.583
(CHUCKLES)

05:43.291 --> 05:45.750
He used to swim at this old rundown pool

05:45.833 --> 05:47.041
all the time.

05:47.125 --> 05:50.791
Splashing around like a porpoise
with swim trunks.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

05:52.208 --> 05:55.375
He would say,
"Jump in, Kiko. Live a little."

05:58.708 --> 06:00.583
I got close a couple of times, but...

06:02.666 --> 06:03.750
never took the leap.

06:06.791 --> 06:07.875
I wish I had.

BAYMAX: You are in good health, Kiko,

06:13.375 --> 06:15.708
therefore, it is not too late...

06:18.041 --> 06:19.916
to live a little.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.208
-Are you ready?
-Whoo!

06:27.583 --> 06:28.583
I think so.
