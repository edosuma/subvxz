WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.203
We're looking for
somebody named stiles.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.904
<i>You went by that name
in the army, right?</i>

00:06.874 --> 00:12.011
They take people, and erase your memories.
You're next.

00:12.013 --> 00:15.214
Melissa: <i> Someone is biting open heads.</i>
(Chomping)

00:15.216 --> 00:18.217
The real question is, "why?"

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:46.946 --> 00:48.947
(Twigs snapping)

00:54.020 --> 00:55.521
(Footsteps approaching)

00:58.792 --> 01:01.393
(Sighs)

01:01.395 --> 01:05.731
You might want to think twice before you
sneak up on a man holding a loaded m-24.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.735
I wasn't sneaking up on you. I was
catching up with you. (Panting)

01:09.737 --> 01:12.204
I know. I heard you
a mile back.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.326
(Breathing heavily) I found
a low branch with my face.

01:16.443 --> 01:17.923
How do you even
see anything out here?

01:18.478 --> 01:19.778
Practice.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.714
Okay. What are you
doing, Melissa?

01:23.616 --> 01:26.118
I thought maybe you
could use some backup.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.821
Which way?

01:33.860 --> 01:37.729
You can leave me out here alone with
a stun gun and a box of band-aids,

01:37.731 --> 01:42.401
or we can just keep going.
It's up to you.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.239
(Electricity crackling)

01:56.182 --> 02:00.152
You're probably wondering why
I'm out here when I could be

02:00.154 --> 02:04.223
nestled at home reading a book. And
that's because I'm sick of seeing people

02:04.225 --> 02:08.727
that I care about wheeled past
the nurses' station on a gurney.

02:10.229 --> 02:14.066
All of you are out here,
risking your lives,

02:14.068 --> 02:17.102
and it's about time
that I do something too.

02:19.106 --> 02:23.208
When tracking
homicidal supernaturals,

02:23.210 --> 02:25.010
it's best to be quiet.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.382
Okay?
Yeah.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.555
Oh!

02:39.325 --> 02:40.459
What is it?

02:42.195 --> 02:43.328
(Whispering) What is it?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.287
(Panting) He's dead.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.460
Oh, no.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.465
(Gasps)

03:22.335 --> 03:26.838
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

03:39.619 --> 03:40.953
How long could she
survive like that?

03:40.955 --> 03:42.120
One, maybe two minutes.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.590
(Sighs) It's still here.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.661
Melissa: Exactly how much training have
you had for a situation like this?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.063
Remember the part
about being quiet?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.898
Yeah.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.108
It's a werewolf?
Werecoyote.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.078
Malia? And she's
coming right at us.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.446
Oh. You're not gonna
shoot her, are you?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.915
No, I'm going to wing her.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.885
(Gunshot)

04:18.690 --> 04:21.159
(Malia growling and snarling)

04:25.832 --> 04:27.332
(Screams)

04:35.541 --> 04:37.709
(Music playing)

05:09.909 --> 05:11.176
That's how he got in?

05:11.478 --> 05:15.080
Mason: It's a point of impact
from a lightning strike.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.948
Usually you'd find
charred spots like that

05:16.950 --> 05:18.750
on the ground
after a violent thunderstorm.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.856
That's how the ghost rider
got in. He rode lightning.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.626
If they can use lightning to
get past the mountain ash...

05:27.628 --> 05:31.863
What about the others?
It's my fault they're marked.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.365
We'll find a way
to protect them.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.836
All of them.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.408
(Malia screams)

05:45.044 --> 05:46.978
(Chris grunts)
Keep her still.

05:49.749 --> 05:53.418
(Breathing heavily)
The morgue? I'm not dead yet.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.255
You're a werecoyote. It's private
down here, and this is going to hurt.

05:58.057 --> 06:01.360
Try not to roar.
(Groans)

06:01.362 --> 06:03.028
(Malia grunts)
You got anything for the pain?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.096
No, I can take it.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.631
It's for me.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.100
What were you doing
in the woods?

06:08.102 --> 06:09.768
Malia: Running.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.836
At 2:00 A.M.?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.938
(Grunts)
Coyotes are nocturnal.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.575
I heard screams. Like
someone-being-murdered type screams.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.076
Did you see anything?
Catch a scent?

06:18.078 --> 06:20.045
Malia: (Grunts) Just blood.
(Sighs)

06:20.047 --> 06:22.881
(Sighs) And that's all I
remember until someone shot me!

06:22.883 --> 06:27.352
It's not her fault. When a
coyote smells a fresh kill,

06:27.354 --> 06:30.722
its senses are overcome.
The blood drives it crazy.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.924
(Malia whimpers)
Melissa: Sorry.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.327
It's pretty deep.
I'm trying not to damage...

06:35.329 --> 06:37.229
(Both yelling)

06:37.231 --> 06:38.463
(Malia breathing heavily)

06:40.032 --> 06:41.967
(Pained grunts)

06:48.207 --> 06:49.341
Here's your bullet back.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.579
(Students chattering
indistinctly)

06:56.182 --> 06:57.482
(Breathing heavily)

07:00.653 --> 07:01.787
(Thunder rumbling faintly)

07:28.614 --> 07:30.649
You don't have to follow
me around everywhere.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.051
I'm just trying
to keep you safe.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.187
What? You're gonna sit
through all my classes?

07:35.189 --> 07:38.990
And what about after school?
What about all night?

07:38.992 --> 07:41.793
Wherever you go, I'll be there.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.465
I'll just stay here.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.633
(Music playing)

07:50.803 --> 07:51.937
(Door closes)

07:54.574 --> 07:56.508
"The k-index
quantifies disturbances"

07:56.510 --> 07:59.644
"in the horizontal component
of earth's magnetic field."

08:04.050 --> 08:07.719
What's a "k-index?"

08:07.721 --> 08:11.857
It's a scale that meteorologists use
to measure thunderstorm activity.

08:11.859 --> 08:16.528
So, a k-index value less than 20 means
no activity, and above 35 is severe.

08:16.530 --> 08:21.032
Mason: Well, your average storm has
about 1,000 lightning strikes.

08:21.034 --> 08:25.437
In the past three months, the average
storm in beacon hills had 5,000.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.938
And what's it reading now?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.910
Uh, 14. We're clear.

08:31.912 --> 08:35.046
Okay, so if a spike in the
k-index means more lightning,

08:36.315 --> 08:39.049
then we can tell if they're coming.
Yeah.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.953
This is good.
Yeah.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.022
(Monitor beeping)

08:46.392 --> 08:50.662
Actually...
This is really bad.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.669
Lydia: It's a relic. (Students
chattering indistinctly)

08:57.671 --> 08:59.104
What's a relic?

08:59.106 --> 09:01.606
An object with a fixed
association to the past.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.608
Jake's ID was left behind
after he was taken.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.545
And Gwen found her sister's
bracelet on her bedroom floor.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.281
How can someone be erased, and
still leave something behind?

09:09.283 --> 09:10.615
A conservation of mass.

09:12.018 --> 09:15.153
The total mass of any isolated
system remains constant.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.990
So, even the ghost riders
have a weakness.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.293
A relic would be proof
that stiles existed.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.396
And maybe we can bring him back.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.333
We need to hide them.
We need to fight them.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.168
We need to hide them.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.870
Who's "them?"
The ghost riders.

09:31.872 --> 09:35.006
The kids at the party.
Got it.

09:35.008 --> 09:38.109
We could get a lightning rod. Attract the
ghost riders and catch them off guard.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.111
But since everyone from
the party is in danger,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.847
all we need to do is find a safe place
to hide them until the storm passes.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.084
The ghost riders ride the
lightning. Nowhere is safe.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.355
It is, if we're underground. The earth can
ground the lightning's electrical charge.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.756
Everyone would be safe.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.124
Okay...

09:54.860 --> 09:56.561
Here's what we're gonna do.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.663
We take everyone into the argent bunker.
It's underground.

09:58.665 --> 10:03.268
We stopped the ghost riders last night.
We can do it again.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.304
You didn't stop them. They just retreated.
We don't know why.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.073
(Exhales)

10:12.511 --> 10:16.414
Okay. How do we get
everyone inside the bunker?

10:20.186 --> 10:22.354
Is this a joke?
No. (Stammers)

10:22.356 --> 10:25.290
And you got to take this seriously. Once
we're all in the bunker, we'll be fine.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.693
I'm not gonna miss the first game of
the year so that you can make captain.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.663
They're a supernatural forces of
nature coming to erase your soul.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.532
It was a man in a hat
with a gun.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.501
And he's coming back
to shoot you in the head.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.011
You want to search my house?

10:46.013 --> 10:49.381
People are leaving things behind.
So if stiles left anything...

10:49.383 --> 10:51.416
Why, why would it be there?

10:51.418 --> 10:55.353
You can't just erase people.
They leave things behind.

10:56.689 --> 10:57.822
(Sighs)

11:03.462 --> 11:08.933
I couldn't sleep last night. So, um, I
got up, figured I'd do some paperwork.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.972
The files were in the back of my car.
So, I, I go to the garage,

11:13.974 --> 11:16.608
and some junk has
fallen off a shelf and I,

11:16.610 --> 11:18.943
I stubbed my toe
on an old baseball bat.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.349
Without thinking
I yelled a name...

11:27.753 --> 11:29.020
Stiles.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.892
Jayden: Why are we
underground?

11:33.894 --> 11:37.762
You guys have a bunker?
Who are you people?

11:37.764 --> 11:40.965
We're the people who know things about the
things that most people don't know about.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.267
What?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.170
Just keep moving.
(Sighs)

11:48.941 --> 11:52.477
Liam... where's Gwen?

12:12.298 --> 12:13.465
I wouldn't touch that.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.767
(Electricity buzzing)

12:17.336 --> 12:19.804
What's all this for?
Your protection.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.539
(Grunting)

12:27.913 --> 12:29.881
Hey, we're missing
three, plus Gwen.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.292
They were at the party,
so they know what's coming.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.128
People see what they want to see.
(Breathing heavily)

12:43.130 --> 12:45.997
Guys, we're running out of time.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.232
Scott, we have to get them.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.635
I'll go. The rest
of you stay here.

12:50.637 --> 12:55.507
Who knows how many are gonna be there
tonight? We're going with you.

12:55.509 --> 12:59.344
Yeah, me too, but at least
I can see them coming.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.279
(Sighs)

13:07.453 --> 13:14.025
All right. But if you
see them coming... run.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.711
Claudia: Is there anything
I can do to help?

13:33.713 --> 13:37.949
No. But thank you,
Mrs. Stilinski.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.720
Well, good luck. (Sighs)
I'll leave you to it.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.345
(Gasps)

14:49.121 --> 14:50.561
(Echoing) You didn't
see it, did you?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.624
See what?

14:52.626 --> 14:54.592
It's right in front
of your face.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.865
(Gasps)

15:01.467 --> 15:02.867
(Breathing heavily)

15:11.877 --> 15:14.312
(Ripping)

15:14.314 --> 15:16.247
(Gasps)
What are you doing?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.717
You're hurting me. (Gasps)

15:22.388 --> 15:24.355
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have done that.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.224
I think that's something
we can agree on.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.202
(Puddle splashing)

15:39.805 --> 15:41.472
(Sighs)

15:41.474 --> 15:43.107
Thanks for coming.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.643
You need my help?
I need a babysitter.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.315
I'm not the babysitting type.
Coyotes eat their young.

15:50.317 --> 15:55.286
You could've killed me
last night. Or worse, Melissa.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.023
But I can help you.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.260
Aren't you the one who shot me?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.129
I come from a family of hunters.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.433
It's our job to deal with situations
that an ordinary person...

16:08.969 --> 16:16.274
You know that bloodlust you felt?
Oh, I've seen that look before.

16:16.276 --> 16:21.379
When I was your age, I saw someone lose
control and slaughter an innocent.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.848
And I did nothing.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.751
I'm not that werewolf. No,
it wasn't a werewolf.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.523
It was a hunter.
And she made excuses.

16:32.525 --> 16:37.328
Made a very convincing case that
lethal force was necessary.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.566
But it wasn't. And if I had
done something that night,

16:42.868 --> 16:46.004
then maybe my sister wouldn't be
the monster that she is today.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.339
Kate.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.846
(Sighs) Animals lose control.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.849
You're not just an animal,
Malia. You're also a human.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.985
You stay that way
by getting involved.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.788
(Device screeching)

17:09.695 --> 17:15.465
I asked her to come. And I asked
you not to touch anything else.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.835
Look, how much longer do
we have to be down here?

17:17.837 --> 17:20.771
As long as it takes.
(Cocking)

17:22.040 --> 17:23.875
Okay, I'll stay.
(Sighs)

17:23.877 --> 17:25.357
You've shot enough
people for one day.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.886
I'm not waiting in a
bunker to get taken.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.488
(Sighs) You have no idea
what you're up against.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.725
Last night, it took all of us
to stop one of them.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.961
If you go out there,
they'll take you too.

17:43.963 --> 17:47.632
They'll find me wherever
I am. Just like Phoebe.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.167
I'm sorry we couldn't
protect her.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.035
But we can protect you.

17:54.339 --> 17:57.675
Don't worry. When it happens,
you won't remember me.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.177
It doesn't have to happen.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.249
You want them to take you.

18:11.024 --> 18:16.127
Convince Okafur, Steinbach, and Wallace
that playing tonight is a bad idea.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.798
You've read everything there is
to know on the ghost riders.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.703
Who's figured anything out. Have you come
across anything that could stop them?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.239
Not yet. But I can try.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.373
Do that.

18:31.610 --> 18:37.682
(Breathing heavily) I can do this.
I can do this.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.884
(Inhales)
I can do this.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.018
(Exhales)

18:46.558 --> 18:49.894
You're late, McCall!
Why aren't you people dressed?

18:49.896 --> 18:56.667
Get your asses moving. Everyone on
the field! Hustle! Hustle! Hustle!

18:59.538 --> 19:01.339
We'll never get them
back into the bunker now.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.107
Get dressed.

19:05.744 --> 19:07.584
Because there's only
one way to keep them safe.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.616
Play the game.

19:18.924 --> 19:22.326
Mrs. Martin: Were you tearing Claudia
Stilinski's wallpaper off her wall?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.594
(Door closes)
No.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.565
Maybe. Yes.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.233
She's worried about
your mental health.

19:31.270 --> 19:35.106
I saw someone in the hallway. Someone Mrs.
Stilinski didn't see.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.641
Well, if Claudia is
not seeing ghosts,

19:36.643 --> 19:42.747
I think he was trying to help me find
something stiles left behind. A relic.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.950
Did you?
No.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.852
Mrs. Stilinski asked me to leave
before I could find anything.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.888
(Chuckles) Probably because you
were tearing her wallpaper.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.060
(Sighs) Oh, honey.

19:58.997 --> 20:02.533
I've known Claudia since
high school. I trust her.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.941
(Sighs) Do you know what
a confirmation bias is?

20:09.943 --> 20:12.076
The tendency to interpret
information in a way

20:12.078 --> 20:13.978
that confirms
an existing preconception.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.514
Yes. It's a biased
perspective.

20:16.516 --> 20:20.251
You're looking for proof to support
what you already believe is true.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.954
Because you want it to be true.

20:25.424 --> 20:29.594
Stiles is real. I know it.

20:29.596 --> 20:33.698
(Sighs) But do you believe
there's a possibility he's not?

20:40.239 --> 20:44.575
Okay. Tell me
everything you know.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.812
I'll be your unbiased perspective.
(Sighs)

20:47.814 --> 20:50.514
(Players clamoring)
(People cheering)

20:59.658 --> 21:04.795
I'll take Steinbach and Wallace.
You take Gwen. You're on Okafur.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.531
What if I see ghost riders?

21:07.533 --> 21:09.300
Yell.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.635
Then get ready to fight.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.171
(Whistle blowing)
(Players grunting)

21:14.573 --> 21:16.140
(Music playing)

21:16.708 --> 21:18.009
Find your own space.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.514
(Audience booing)

21:24.216 --> 21:25.349
(Buzzing)

21:26.218 --> 21:28.686
(Both grunt)

21:30.822 --> 21:31.956
You wanna back off?

21:38.797 --> 21:39.930
(Buzzing)

21:40.465 --> 21:42.033
Woman:
Go, Liam, go!

21:42.634 --> 21:44.769
(All grunting)

21:46.505 --> 21:48.339
Steinbach:
Come on, man.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.701
There's no ghosts
out here, McCall.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.146
(Buzzing)

21:56.982 --> 22:01.986
What are you doing out there? I'm
gonna kill the three of you.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.424
Do these guys ever practice?

22:06.426 --> 22:07.725
Not enough.

22:10.462 --> 22:11.996
It's just first period.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.397
They could still win.

22:20.572 --> 22:23.708
How do you know that they can't
get in and shoot all of us?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.143
I'll never graduate.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.146
I'll never do anything.
This is it!

22:29.682 --> 22:33.250
Can you think of a better,
less-seizure inducing way?

22:33.252 --> 22:37.555
Don't any of you get it? We
are never leaving this place.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.523
Malia: Jayden.
(Shuddering)

22:39.525 --> 22:42.593
It's okay. Before they get in
here, they got to go through us.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.761
What if that's not enough?

22:43.763 --> 22:46.330
No one is getting
through that door.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.417
(Gasps) Nathan's missing.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.053
(Players clamoring)
(Audience cheering)

23:13.258 --> 23:17.094
(Thunder rumbling)
On your knees.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.400
(Audience cheering)

23:22.402 --> 23:26.470
Yes. Yes. Yes.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.239
(Cheering)

23:29.641 --> 23:31.342
Yes!
(Audience groaning)

23:31.344 --> 23:32.610
Both: Wrong team.

23:33.011 --> 23:34.278
Sorry.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.387
(Both grunting)

23:52.397 --> 23:53.531
(Whistle blowing)

24:00.338 --> 24:06.444
Yes, Dunbar! That's the kind of
passion I want to see. Unleash hell!

24:07.078 --> 24:08.379
What's gotten into everyone?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.592
What if it's the wild hunt? What
if it's affecting everyone?

24:21.594 --> 24:22.893
(Thunder rumbling)

24:28.900 --> 24:30.868
(Wind whooshing)
(Whistle blowing)

24:36.208 --> 24:37.842
(Indistinct chatter)

24:41.079 --> 24:44.715
It's Parrish. (Panting) He's the
reason the ghost rider left the party.

24:44.717 --> 24:48.586
Tell her we need to meet Parrish
at the school right now.

24:48.588 --> 24:52.523
What about Gwen? What about the other
players? We have to keep them safe.

24:52.525 --> 24:55.192
Parrish could keep everyone safe.
(Breathing heavily)

24:56.194 --> 24:57.328
(Horse neighing)

24:59.264 --> 25:00.531
(Lightning crackling)

25:06.238 --> 25:07.371
They're here.

25:09.274 --> 25:10.508
Liam!

25:11.843 --> 25:13.077
I see 'em!

25:15.180 --> 25:16.480
(Lightning crashing)

25:20.852 --> 25:22.119
What happens if he gets out?
(Breathing heavily)

25:22.121 --> 25:23.420
He'll break the seal.

25:27.058 --> 25:28.392
This way.

25:33.131 --> 25:34.265
(Crackling)

25:35.967 --> 25:39.103
(All clamoring)
(Whistle blowing)

25:39.771 --> 25:41.171
(All booing)

25:43.408 --> 25:47.011
Oh, come on, ref! This is
barely a thunderstorm!

25:47.013 --> 25:48.145
(Thunder crashing)

25:52.751 --> 25:54.311
Scott: Okay. We've got
all three, right?

25:56.054 --> 25:59.189
Scott, there were four.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.137
(Horse neighing)

26:18.143 --> 26:19.643
(Screaming)

26:32.524 --> 26:36.293
(Grunts)
(Thunder rumbling)

26:36.295 --> 26:37.695
(Hayden and Mason
breathing heavily)

26:38.064 --> 26:40.631
The ghost riders
are afraid of you.

26:40.633 --> 26:46.604
You're the reason he left Gwen.
You can stop them.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.838
We need you.

26:51.209 --> 26:52.743
The other you.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.512
(Sighs)

26:56.948 --> 26:59.149
You were good back
there with Jayden.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.118
Thanks. I still want
to kill Nathan.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.053
At this point, so do I.
Which way?

27:03.321 --> 27:04.788
This way.

27:17.369 --> 27:18.669
Are you okay?

27:36.688 --> 27:38.522
(Horses neighing)

27:44.562 --> 27:46.497
Okafur: Oh, my god!
They're real!

27:46.499 --> 27:49.466
Stay together. We'll protect you.
How?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.007
(Neighing)

27:57.009 --> 27:59.109
(Echoing)
Run!

28:05.050 --> 28:06.350
Liam: Stay close!

28:22.434 --> 28:23.667
(Gunshot)

28:33.778 --> 28:34.912
(Gunshot)

28:48.460 --> 28:49.927
(Music playing)

29:00.138 --> 29:01.572
(Gunshot)

29:11.483 --> 29:12.816
I can still see them!

29:19.691 --> 29:21.825
(Growling)

29:24.662 --> 29:25.796
(Grunting)
(Horse neighing)

29:26.931 --> 29:28.065
Scott: Liam!

29:33.772 --> 29:34.905
(Grunting)

29:37.275 --> 29:38.408
(Growling)

29:38.843 --> 29:40.110
(Gunshot)

29:43.948 --> 29:45.315
(Growling)

29:46.885 --> 29:48.285
We can't stop 'em!

29:48.287 --> 29:51.355
Protect Gwen!
(Growling)

29:53.158 --> 29:54.324
Melissa: You want what?

29:56.829 --> 30:00.497
Claudia's medical records. Just for a
minute. We know it's a lot to ask.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.567
It's up there.
It's way up there.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.837
As the more recently enlightened
of the two of us, just trust me.

30:06.839 --> 30:11.175
Letting the two of you look at private
medical records is completely

30:11.177 --> 30:13.143
and utterly against
hospital regulations.

30:15.013 --> 30:18.315
So, we better make this fast.

30:22.688 --> 30:29.226
No. I don't know. Maybe. (Panting)
It's like he was right here.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.795
But no Nathan. He's still here.
I know it.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.377
(Panting)

30:49.113 --> 30:51.982
Malia: (Echoing) Nathan,
I know you're there.

30:54.752 --> 30:57.621
How? Chris: (Echoing) Stay put.
We're coming to get you.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.089
No, you're not.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.060
He's moving. You need
to stop running.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.862
You're gonna lead
them right to us!

31:07.832 --> 31:09.867
Nathan!

31:13.404 --> 31:15.405
Shoot him. Did you
listen to my story?

31:15.407 --> 31:17.741
Just clip him.
You clipped me.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.677
You healed. Come on.
We're wasting time.

31:21.646 --> 31:22.779
(Growling)

31:27.051 --> 31:29.386
(Wind whooshing)
(Spurs clinking)

31:29.654 --> 31:30.787
(Panting)

31:38.830 --> 31:39.963
(Gunshot)

31:47.839 --> 31:49.406
Stay back.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.258
(Growling)

32:18.703 --> 32:19.836
(Gunshot)

32:34.018 --> 32:35.285
(Groans)

32:45.763 --> 32:46.897
(Gasps)

32:48.833 --> 32:49.967
(Breathing heavily)

32:57.008 --> 32:58.141
(Horse nickering)

33:02.547 --> 33:03.680
(Growling)

33:11.189 --> 33:12.389
Come on!

33:15.960 --> 33:18.195
No!
(Gunshot)

33:23.401 --> 33:24.534
No!

33:37.115 --> 33:38.648
(Breathing heavily)

33:40.952 --> 33:43.253
Chris: Nathan! Nathan!

33:43.255 --> 33:45.122
We can keep you safe!

33:45.124 --> 33:48.825
Bull. I'm out of here.
(Grunting)

33:53.231 --> 33:55.699
(Clanking)
(Lightning crackling)

33:57.368 --> 33:58.502
(Gunshot)

34:04.075 --> 34:05.208
(Spurs ringing)

34:22.994 --> 34:24.127
(Horses neighing)

34:30.368 --> 34:31.802
(Roaring)

34:34.505 --> 34:35.572
(Whip cracking)

34:35.574 --> 34:36.706
(Gun firing)

34:41.612 --> 34:43.513
(Monitor beeping)
(Keyboard clacking)

34:53.190 --> 34:55.058
Sorry, guys. According
to her medical records,

34:55.060 --> 34:56.393
Claudia never had children.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.932
Well, but she had...

35:01.934 --> 35:05.669
Frontotemporal dementia.
There must be a mistake.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.704
How long ago?
She seems fine now.

35:07.706 --> 35:14.177
Ten years? I'm surprised she's still
alive, honestly. It's a miracle.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.414
(Hayden panting)

35:23.454 --> 35:25.155
Everyone from the
bunker has been taken.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.391
Everyone? How?

35:28.393 --> 35:32.696
Malia is at the hospital. Argent's
been hurt. My mom's with them.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.764
Scott.

35:37.268 --> 35:41.204
Tonight... No. Hey,
it's not your fault.

35:43.241 --> 35:48.111
It's mine. We should have done both.
Defend the bunker and use a lightning rod.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.154
It would've given us
a better chance.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.657
You okay?

36:05.763 --> 36:06.997
No.

36:11.903 --> 36:17.307
There he is. Look at that.
The humility. The grace.

36:17.309 --> 36:22.479
Sure, that wasn't lacrosse
we played out there tonight.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.681
That was la-crap!

36:25.551 --> 36:33.256
You stayed on the field while the
rest of these losers ran inside.

36:33.258 --> 36:36.826
Coach, we lost.
We lost everything.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.564
Listen to the despair.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.732
The rage simmering
underneath it.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.534
(Sighs)

36:44.536 --> 36:48.405
See that, people?
He still thinks he can win.

36:48.407 --> 36:53.376
That's why next time he will win.
Because he will find a way.

36:53.378 --> 36:57.581
Now, show your new captain
some love, you pukes!

36:57.583 --> 36:58.743
(All clapping half-heartedly)

37:01.219 --> 37:02.686
I said,
"show him some love!"

37:03.187 --> 37:04.588
(Clapping)

37:04.590 --> 37:08.225
All: (Chanting)
Liam! Liam! Liam!

37:25.077 --> 37:31.348
(Sighs) He has blunt force trauma to
his temporal bone, three broken ribs,

37:31.350 --> 37:34.484
and multiple surface lacerations
which seem to be from

37:35.553 --> 37:36.686
whip marks?

37:39.790 --> 37:41.458
What he needs is a lot of rest.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.593
Lydia: What happened?

37:46.430 --> 37:49.532
Malia: The ghost riders took everyone.
We barely slowed them down.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.202
Tell us you found something.

37:52.204 --> 37:56.973
I found out Claudia never had children.
So, stiles can't be her son.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.576
What about a relic?

38:03.648 --> 38:05.749
There never was
a stiles, was there?

38:08.486 --> 38:12.022
It doesn't even sound like a real name.
We have to keep looking.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.291
Check the school records
again. Or call Scott's dad...

38:14.293 --> 38:15.959
We're fighting the wrong battle.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.794
We're trying to bring
stiles back.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.331
The ghost riders came back. We still
have no way of stopping them.

38:21.333 --> 38:25.502
And whatever they are, they're real. We
can't keep chasing someone who isn't.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.438
He didn't leave anything behind.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.108
Just us.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.444
(Monitor beeping)

38:46.590 --> 38:49.859
Hayden: Liam? Mason: What
are you still doin' here?

38:49.861 --> 38:52.862
Everyone's gone. Literally.
And we should go too.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.968
Do you want a ride?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.975
I want to catch one.

39:07.812 --> 39:09.546
(Music playing)

39:09.548 --> 39:10.947
What do you wanna catch one?

39:10.949 --> 39:12.048
One of the ghost riders?

39:12.050 --> 39:14.050
Yeah. Go home.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.977
We're not going.
We're not leaving you.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.046
Somebody just made
team captain, right?

39:46.150 --> 39:49.419
Yeah. Guess I did.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.322
Then what do we do?

39:57.928 --> 39:59.562
We catch a ghost rider.
