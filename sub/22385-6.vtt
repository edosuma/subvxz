00:07.918 --> 00:08.917
Copy that.

00:25.034 --> 00:26.768
Hey!

00:26.804 --> 00:27.768
Uhh!

00:33.209 --> 00:35.943
FBI! Visiting hours
are over.

00:35.979 --> 00:38.282
Next time, I suggest
you bring some flowers.

00:45.556 --> 00:46.453
Son of a...

00:46.489 --> 00:48.422
It's this damn gun again!

00:48.458 --> 00:50.190
Cut!

00:50.226 --> 00:52.359
<i>And that's a cut.
Thanks, guys.</i>

00:52.395 --> 00:55.462
<i>Let's get first team some water
and some touchups.</i>

00:55.498 --> 00:58.398
<i>Let's reset the guns,
let's reset the windows.</i>

00:58.434 --> 01:00.471
<i>All right, we're going again
in two minutes, people.</i>

01:01.971 --> 01:03.905
No. No.

01:03.941 --> 01:05.339
Give me that gun.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.941
Why are you waiting until
there until you rack it

01:06.977 --> 01:08.009
and put one in the chamber?

01:08.045 --> 01:09.510
For the dramatic effect.

01:09.546 --> 01:11.946
So you're pointing an empty
chamber at your enemy?

01:11.982 --> 01:14.949
He would have shot you
for being stupid.

01:14.985 --> 01:18.852
Now, the gun's jamming and that
slide is catching the brass...

01:18.888 --> 01:20.288
'cause you're not
holding it tight enough.

01:20.324 --> 01:21.923
Come here.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.259
Like that, all right?
Or like... like that.

01:24.295 --> 01:26.393
All right, so soon as that guy
comes through that window,

01:26.429 --> 01:28.830
bang, bang, bang...
they're dead.

01:28.866 --> 01:30.230
Hey, man,
what's the holdup?

01:30.266 --> 01:33.200
Just unjam the damn gun
already, okay?

01:33.236 --> 01:34.435
Who the hell's this guy?

01:34.471 --> 01:36.236
I'm your new
FBI consultant.

01:36.272 --> 01:37.572
So, do you
want your star

01:37.608 --> 01:38.907
to look like
a real agent,

01:38.943 --> 01:40.208
or do you want him
to look like an idiot

01:40.244 --> 01:42.013
and flush $100 million
down the drain?

01:58.995 --> 01:59.961
Weller.

01:59.997 --> 02:01.361
You sound exhausted.

02:01.397 --> 02:03.997
Are you sure you're
getting enough sleep?

02:06.035 --> 02:07.037
What do you want?

02:08.271 --> 02:09.937
I need another favor.

02:09.973 --> 02:10.771
<i>A favor?</i>

02:10.808 --> 02:13.607
After you put
a tattoo on Jane...

02:13.643 --> 02:15.375
that told her
that she had a daughter?

02:15.411 --> 02:16.945
Our deal wasn't
about the daughter.

02:16.981 --> 02:19.080
It was about Berlin.
You know that.

02:19.116 --> 02:20.314
<i>They are the same thing!</i>

02:20.350 --> 02:21.616
If she goes
looking for one,

02:21.652 --> 02:23.384
then she'll find the other.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.953
When she finds out
the truth...

02:25.989 --> 02:27.921
it will destroy her.

02:27.957 --> 02:29.356
Destroy <i>her?</i>

02:29.392 --> 02:31.625
Or her love for you?

02:31.661 --> 02:33.528
Either way,
I guess you better make sure

02:33.564 --> 02:36.231
Jane doesn't go looking.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.599
For both your sakes.

02:37.635 --> 02:41.336
Now I know why you just
called me on the phone.

02:41.372 --> 02:44.505
Because you know if we're
ever in the same room again...

02:44.541 --> 02:46.908
I am gonna to kill you.

02:46.944 --> 02:47.641
<i>Well, until then,</i>

02:47.677 --> 02:50.511
I'll assume our deal
still holds.

02:50.547 --> 02:53.885
Do you like movies, Kurt?

02:56.019 --> 02:58.122
Hey, Weller, Zapata and I
have something that we...

03:01.158 --> 03:02.522
Something on your mind?

03:02.558 --> 03:03.658
It's the latest issue,

03:03.694 --> 03:05.459
but there is
a tattoo clue in there.

03:05.495 --> 03:07.362
Since when do you follow
entertainment news?

03:07.398 --> 03:09.529
I don't, all right?
It was in my dentist's office.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.366
Lucky you,
the latest periodical.

03:11.402 --> 03:14.201
- My dentist has Alf on the cover.
- Yeah.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.403
Look, here's the interview.

03:16.439 --> 03:18.139
All right,
Keith Rhodes goes off

03:18.175 --> 03:20.540
on everyone in Hollywood,
including his own producers.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.111
But... I notice this logo.

03:23.147 --> 03:24.411
"Sacred Lynx Productions."

03:24.447 --> 03:26.147
That is the production company

03:26.183 --> 03:28.887
that funds
all of Keith's films.

03:31.054 --> 03:33.053
It actually looks like
one of the new tattoos,

03:33.089 --> 03:35.422
but why would Roman care about
a film production company?

03:35.458 --> 03:37.391
I don't know...
but Sacred Lynx Productions,

03:37.427 --> 03:38.927
that could be a front
for something.

03:38.963 --> 03:41.129
And it is our job
to find out what for.

03:41.165 --> 03:44.564
Okay, so these squares
all over the tattoo...

03:44.600 --> 03:46.701
decoding them could tell us
what we're dealing with.

03:46.737 --> 03:49.369
So do it. And can you
loop in Reade and Hirst?

03:49.405 --> 03:51.706
Uh... yeah,
that's actually what

03:51.742 --> 03:54.144
Tasha and I wanted
to talk to you about.

03:55.345 --> 03:56.576
So you two
are sure about this?

03:56.612 --> 03:59.046
Yeah, the tattoos
point to Hirst.

03:59.082 --> 04:01.315
Well, the tattoos point
to things about us, too.

04:01.351 --> 04:03.051
Not like this.

04:03.087 --> 04:05.486
The tattoos expose a sustained
pattern of corruption

04:05.522 --> 04:08.556
on behalf of someone big
at the FBI.

04:08.592 --> 04:12.059
Stuart was murdered for
getting close to the truth.

04:12.095 --> 04:14.095
And Hirst is
covering up that murder.

04:14.131 --> 04:16.596
We caught her trying to destroy
evidence and pin it on Reade.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.165
Well, this is
Roman's end game.

04:18.201 --> 04:22.203
He wants us to take down
the director of the entire FBI.

04:22.239 --> 04:23.670
We have to tell Reade.

04:23.706 --> 04:25.672
We tried to tell
Reade, but he wouldn't listen.

04:25.708 --> 04:29.177
Sometimes loyalty can
blind you to the truth.

04:29.213 --> 04:31.612
You don't think Reade
is in league with her?

04:31.648 --> 04:33.047
No!

04:33.083 --> 04:34.648
Reade is not
a criminal, okay?

04:34.684 --> 04:37.985
We know him.
He's innocent.

04:38.021 --> 04:38.853
Zapata's right.

04:38.889 --> 04:40.254
Hirst wouldn't have
tried to frame Reade

04:40.290 --> 04:42.055
if he was connected
to her crimes.

04:42.091 --> 04:44.992
If he sides with Hirst through
some misplaced allegiance...

04:45.028 --> 04:47.461
He could be an obstacle
in trying to take her down.

04:47.497 --> 04:50.167
Or get pulled down
with her.

05:02.379 --> 05:04.444
Everything is there.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.047
Who she talks to,
where she eats.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.417
Even how
she likes her coffee.

05:09.453 --> 05:11.251
Mr. Jakeman?

05:11.287 --> 05:13.658
I will be disappointed
if you're just some jilted ex.

05:15.124 --> 05:17.458
I'm paying you
not to care who I am.

05:17.494 --> 05:20.263
Or try to find out.
Understood?

05:25.836 --> 05:28.602
Sacred Linx Productions
is a Russian company

05:28.638 --> 05:31.304
that came out of nowhere
and became a major backer

05:31.340 --> 05:32.607
of Keith Rhodes' movies.

05:32.643 --> 05:33.708
We don't know who owns it...
it was set up

05:33.744 --> 05:35.442
through a maze
of tax shelters.

05:35.478 --> 05:36.711
If this company
has been around,

05:36.747 --> 05:38.478
why didn't your database
make a match sooner?

05:38.514 --> 05:40.047
That's an excellent
question.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.050
Thought you had
community service today.

05:42.086 --> 05:43.583
And what better
community to serve

05:43.619 --> 05:45.787
than my poor,
pop culture-deprived friends

05:45.823 --> 05:47.254
with their Keith Rhodes case.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.424
Hey, I've been a big fan
since his sitcom days.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.427
So few child actors make the
successful transition into adulthood.

05:52.463 --> 05:54.227
He could have gone
full Screech.

05:54.263 --> 05:55.629
Rich...

05:55.665 --> 05:57.398
All I'm saying is you're
gonna want me for this case.

05:57.434 --> 05:58.833
Also, can you
please sign this

05:58.869 --> 06:00.367
to get me out of community service?
Thank you.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.802
Okay, so where were we?

06:01.838 --> 06:03.170
The tattoo contains

06:03.206 --> 06:04.538
enough differences
from the logo,

06:04.574 --> 06:06.740
which is why
the database missed it.

06:06.776 --> 06:09.477
And, if you assign values
to these squares

06:09.513 --> 06:12.480
based on how shaded they are,
do a little math...

06:12.516 --> 06:16.617
that leads to a backup account
for a paparazzi service

06:16.653 --> 06:19.119
that has a keen interest
in Keith Rhodes.

06:19.155 --> 06:22.557
Specifically, the tattoo
points to this picture,

06:22.593 --> 06:24.725
which was taken on
a movie set in Europe.

06:24.761 --> 06:27.528
That is Niko Popov,
leader of The Brigada,

06:27.564 --> 06:29.263
a transnational
crime syndicate.

06:29.299 --> 06:31.566
You name it, they traffic
in it... guns, drugs, humans.

06:31.602 --> 06:33.701
They've been spreading across
Eastern Europe like the plague.

06:33.737 --> 06:37.105
Using terrorist acts to take down
anyone who stands in their way.

06:37.141 --> 06:40.508
My friends at INTERPOL
call Niko "The Canary."

06:40.544 --> 06:41.609
Because he loves to sing?

06:41.645 --> 06:43.543
Because he never
leaves Moscow

06:43.579 --> 06:45.246
unless he's scouting
an attack.

06:45.282 --> 06:47.547
If you see him,
it means death is coming.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.850
I mean, he could
do that and sing.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.518
Okay, what's
an American movie star

06:50.554 --> 06:52.252
doing hanging out with
an international terrorist?

06:52.288 --> 06:53.888
The Brigada's been
wanting to make a splash

06:53.924 --> 06:55.523
in the US
for some time now.

06:55.559 --> 06:57.391
But the CIA knows
almost nothing

06:57.427 --> 06:59.160
about their
American associates.

06:59.196 --> 07:01.394
Well, we know one now.
Keith Rhodes.

07:01.430 --> 07:04.831
Um, guys, I'm scrolling through
the Keith Rhodes photo account,

07:04.867 --> 07:06.603
and you're gonna
want to see this.

07:08.304 --> 07:09.269
Rich...

07:09.305 --> 07:11.204
What? No, not...
not the woman.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.441
That's Niko's receding hairline
leaving the nightclub.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.675
This was
taken yesterday.

07:15.711 --> 07:16.843
In Manhattan.

07:16.879 --> 07:18.278
Wait, if
Niko's here...

07:18.314 --> 07:19.579
Then so's The Brigada.

07:19.615 --> 07:22.415
And they're about
to attack US soil.

07:27.556 --> 07:32.556
Subtitles by explosiveskull

07:33.274 --> 07:35.125
With Niko Popov on US soil,

07:35.161 --> 07:37.189
I have to put DHS
on high alert.

07:37.225 --> 07:39.768
Reade, your team is empowered
to do whatever it takes

07:39.804 --> 07:42.972
to stop whatever
he's plotting.

07:43.008 --> 07:44.305
All right,
you heard the lady.

07:44.341 --> 07:46.307
She's got our back.
Let's not let her down.

07:46.343 --> 07:47.742
We need eyes on that nightclub

07:47.778 --> 07:49.311
in case Niko
goes back there.

07:49.347 --> 07:50.379
You got it.

07:50.415 --> 07:51.747
Our only other lead
right now

07:51.783 --> 07:53.281
is an overrated
Hollywood actor.

07:53.317 --> 07:55.384
Overrated? The man
has a Moon Man award

07:55.420 --> 07:57.119
for Best Kiss...
how dare you?

07:57.155 --> 07:58.453
It's gonna be tough
talking to Keith

07:58.489 --> 08:00.855
without tipping off Niko
the FBI's onto him.

08:00.891 --> 08:03.225
You're right. We're gonna need
a good cover to get in there.

08:03.261 --> 08:05.393
Sub in
as Keith's driver?

08:05.429 --> 08:07.429
Breach his house
as utility workers.

08:07.465 --> 08:09.331
Or we could go undercover
as ourselves.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.266
Keith is currently shooting
"A Death Before Dying,"

08:11.302 --> 08:13.869
about a roguish FBI agent

08:13.905 --> 08:16.706
who gets too close to an asset
with a deadly secret.

08:16.742 --> 08:17.973
Oh, my God,
that sounds ridiculous.

08:18.009 --> 08:20.076
But if anyone could
pull that off, it's Keith.

08:20.112 --> 08:23.078
Look they already
have an FBI consultant.

08:23.114 --> 08:24.879
Could swap one of us in.

08:24.915 --> 08:25.948
I'm your new FBI consultant.

08:25.984 --> 08:28.384
So, do you want your star
to look like a real agent,

08:28.420 --> 08:30.086
or do you want him to
look like an idiot

08:30.122 --> 08:33.089
and flush $100 million
down the drain?

08:33.125 --> 08:35.356
Let's just go again.
We're going again!

08:35.392 --> 08:37.359
See? This is what
I wanted. Authenticity!

08:37.395 --> 08:38.427
This guy knows
what he's talking about

08:38.462 --> 08:39.427
'cause he's a real cop.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.230
No, I'm a federal agent.

08:41.265 --> 08:43.164
Exactly. See? Authentic!

08:43.200 --> 08:44.767
Let's go back to one!

08:44.803 --> 08:46.502
I trained with the Green Berets
for my last film.

08:46.538 --> 08:48.336
They practically said
I was field ready by the end.

08:48.372 --> 08:50.038
If you see something you
don't like, you let me know.

08:50.074 --> 08:51.773
'Cause I'm
all about real, okay?

08:51.809 --> 08:54.143
There is something that I do
want to talk to you about.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.211
Oh, well, awesome. Let's,
uh, let's talk over lunch.

08:56.247 --> 08:57.379
Here's your gun.

08:57.415 --> 08:59.047
- Hold it tight.
- Okay.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.448
Just get it done.

09:01.852 --> 09:03.451
Don't pay too much attention

09:03.487 --> 09:05.120
to our hack director
back there.

09:05.156 --> 09:08.057
If having you on set makes Keith
happy, it makes me happy.

09:08.093 --> 09:09.892
Booky Bentley, producer.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.263
Special Agent Weller.

09:14.199 --> 09:15.464
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.234
Uh, we need to rescan
your tattoos.

09:18.270 --> 09:19.467
Is that necessary?

09:19.503 --> 09:21.302
I mean,
as much as I love

09:21.338 --> 09:23.004
getting naked and spun around

09:23.040 --> 09:25.340
while millions of lasers and
cameras scan my body, that's...

09:25.376 --> 09:27.308
Hirst has already used
her power to bury leads

09:27.344 --> 09:28.880
and manipulate evidence.

09:31.382 --> 09:32.981
Which means
there's a strong chance

09:33.017 --> 09:34.350
she's already corrupted
the tattoo database

09:34.386 --> 09:35.417
to get us off her trail.

09:35.453 --> 09:37.485
So, we need to set up

09:37.521 --> 09:39.455
our own secure database,
off site,

09:39.491 --> 09:40.523
and away from Hirst.

09:40.559 --> 09:42.423
Easier said than done.

09:42.459 --> 09:44.360
We can't scan my body
without the metal disc

09:44.396 --> 09:46.064
that activates my new tattoos.

09:49.099 --> 09:50.965
And they're not gonna just
let us walk out of here with it.

09:51.001 --> 09:53.101
There are metal detectors
at every exit,

09:53.137 --> 09:56.205
specifically designed to keep
things like that from leaving.

09:56.241 --> 09:57.505
You two get the discs.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.043
I'll take care
of the metal detector.

10:00.477 --> 10:04.279
Ugh! She's totally gonna get
some cool CIA gadget.

10:04.315 --> 10:06.285
Patterson, um...

10:08.453 --> 10:10.219
About the search
for my daughter.

10:10.255 --> 10:11.553
Yes, I... I am on it.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.556
Um, we haven't found
anything yet, but I did...

10:13.592 --> 10:15.561
I changed my mind,
I don't want to find her.

10:16.895 --> 10:18.827
Okay... I...

10:18.863 --> 10:20.395
Aren't you just like
a little bit curious

10:20.431 --> 10:23.331
where half of
your DNA wound up?

10:23.367 --> 10:25.066
This girl's been
living her own life

10:25.102 --> 10:26.836
for the last 18 years.

10:26.872 --> 10:31.142
Without me and all the stuff
that comes with me.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.008
Whatever she's doing...

10:33.044 --> 10:36.077
I'll just make everything
more complicated for her.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.980
I totally understand.

10:38.016 --> 10:41.450
But... maybe she's
looking for the truth.

10:41.486 --> 10:43.219
I mean, maybe she's
been searching for you

10:43.255 --> 10:45.354
this whole time.

10:45.390 --> 10:47.456
I...

10:47.492 --> 10:50.094
I'm totally overstepping
my bounds right now, I...

10:51.396 --> 10:53.598
You do whatever
you think is right.

11:08.579 --> 11:11.046
Don't worry,
we gussy it up in post.

11:14.953 --> 11:15.920
Uhh!

11:18.122 --> 11:19.488
He's not acting.

11:19.524 --> 11:21.123
That machine
is really on.

11:21.159 --> 11:22.358
Call an ambulance!

11:22.394 --> 11:23.424
Get the medic!

11:23.460 --> 11:25.527
Right away!

11:32.069 --> 11:35.040
Tom? Tom Jakeman?

11:36.440 --> 11:39.340
Blake? Oh, my God.

11:39.376 --> 11:42.110
Sorry, I guess I was a
little too into my book.

11:42.146 --> 11:43.046
You like Didion?

11:43.082 --> 11:46.047
I just re-read
"Slouching Towards Bethlehem."

11:46.083 --> 11:47.081
One of the best.

11:48.553 --> 11:50.385
So weird
running into you.

11:50.421 --> 11:53.087
I mean, good weird,
obviously.

11:53.123 --> 11:55.090
I see you're still
wearing your wish bracelet.

11:55.126 --> 11:57.196
You deserve this wish
more than I do.

12:01.565 --> 12:05.100
Well, it's bad luck
to take it off, remember?

12:05.136 --> 12:08.537
So, what's my favorite
charity auction bidder

12:08.573 --> 12:10.272
doing in Barcelona?

12:10.308 --> 12:11.539
It's a long story.

12:11.575 --> 12:13.207
It involves a friend,
his funeral,

12:13.243 --> 12:15.543
and a list of cities
he always wanted to visit.

12:15.579 --> 12:17.712
The same friend
you mentioned at the auction.

12:17.748 --> 12:19.347
You have a good memory.

12:19.383 --> 12:22.150
And you have a good heart.

12:22.186 --> 12:23.985
My mate was obsessed
with this city, and I...

12:24.021 --> 12:26.020
I mean, I barely know
where to start.

12:26.056 --> 12:28.557
Oh, well, lucky for you,
I practically grew up here.

12:28.593 --> 12:31.497
So, there's the Gothic Quarter
and Parc Guell and...

12:33.430 --> 12:35.563
What are you doing
this afternoon?

12:35.599 --> 12:39.435
I'd... I'd love to show you
some of my favorite spots.

12:39.471 --> 12:42.204
I mean...
I don't want to impose.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.038
You're not, and...

12:44.074 --> 12:47.011
I'm not taking
"no" for an answer.

12:48.078 --> 12:49.445
All right.

12:49.481 --> 12:50.950
Okay.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.459
No, no, no,
no, don't fight.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.726
I don't think
it's a coincidence

13:04.762 --> 13:07.028
that a day after Niko
was spotted in the city,

13:07.064 --> 13:09.731
Keith almost died in
a freak accident on the set.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.066
You think Niko
tried to kill him?

13:11.102 --> 13:12.533
<i>I spoke to the prop master.</i>

13:12.569 --> 13:13.701
He swears that someone

13:13.737 --> 13:15.336
had tampered
with the defibrillator.

13:15.372 --> 13:16.504
I believe him.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.206
<i>We gotta bring Keith in.</i>

13:18.242 --> 13:20.545
We do that,
Niko knows we're onto him.

13:22.546 --> 13:24.145
Special Agent Weller!

13:24.181 --> 13:26.617
That guy saved my life!
He's a real national hero!

13:29.219 --> 13:30.989
I got an idea.

13:35.293 --> 13:37.259
Okay, Keith, let me
show you around.

13:37.295 --> 13:38.360
Yes, this is great.

13:38.396 --> 13:40.329
This research is really
gonna ground the performance.

13:40.365 --> 13:41.663
I just want it to be real.

13:41.699 --> 13:43.164
And this is as real
as it gets.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.700
I mean, you guys
put your lives on the line

13:44.736 --> 13:46.534
for, like, a tenth
of what I make, I mean...

13:46.570 --> 13:49.404
That's... that's real.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.706
The realest.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.273
Keith, this is Patterson.

13:52.309 --> 13:55.576
And this is Jane.
This is Tasha.

13:55.612 --> 13:57.245
Rich Dotcom.
Maybe you've heard of me?

13:57.281 --> 14:00.051
Former King of the Dark Web?
Current FBI secret weapon?

14:00.852 --> 14:02.750
Um... that's nice ink.

14:02.786 --> 14:04.186
I bet there's
a great story there.

14:04.222 --> 14:06.321
- You'd never believe it.
- Try me.

14:06.357 --> 14:07.822
You know, I've seen
all your movies.

14:07.858 --> 14:09.424
Even the bad ones. What?

14:09.460 --> 14:11.460
Not that there's bad ones.
Why would I say that?

14:11.496 --> 14:13.195
Okay.

14:13.231 --> 14:15.696
So... Patterson.
What do you do?

14:15.732 --> 14:18.299
Oh, I just,
you know, work here.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.735
Just doing this stuff.
Just real stuff.

14:20.771 --> 14:22.437
Okay, Keith, uh...

14:22.473 --> 14:23.739
let's go on that tour.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.209
- Okay. Ready.
- Yeah.

14:27.712 --> 14:30.845
So... this is where
the magic happens, huh?

14:30.881 --> 14:31.846
Yeah.

14:31.882 --> 14:33.081
You can take a seat,
Keith.

14:33.117 --> 14:34.582
Oh, yeah, run me
through it.

14:34.618 --> 14:36.518
Show me how to break a perp
and get him to start confessing.

14:36.554 --> 14:38.187
What can you tell us
about this man?

14:38.223 --> 14:40.188
Wait, wait, give me some
context first, you know?

14:40.224 --> 14:43.227
What's my character?
Who is this guy to me?

14:46.764 --> 14:48.663
Are you guys
interrogating me?

14:48.699 --> 14:51.466
Where is this guy
right now?

14:51.502 --> 14:52.734
Niko? I...

14:52.770 --> 14:54.869
I... I don't know,
he's just some rich film buff

14:54.905 --> 14:56.605
who likes to invest
in the movies.

14:56.641 --> 14:59.874
We believe that
this "film buff"...

14:59.910 --> 15:01.509
just tried to kill you.

15:01.545 --> 15:02.510
What?

15:02.546 --> 15:03.744
Oh, the defib thing?

15:03.780 --> 15:05.647
No, that was...
that was an accident.

15:05.683 --> 15:08.216
Sacred Lynx Productions

15:08.252 --> 15:10.451
is actually a front
for The Brigada.

15:10.487 --> 15:12.687
They're a terrorist
group that is responsible

15:12.723 --> 15:15.490
for a massive amount
of death and destruction

15:15.526 --> 15:17.493
across Europe and Asia.

15:17.529 --> 15:19.628
"My last movie
cost a hundred mill.

15:19.664 --> 15:21.296
"Critics said
it looked cheap.

15:21.332 --> 15:23.898
"Asked where all the money
went... good question.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.667
"Why don't they ask
those 'expletives'

15:25.703 --> 15:27.369
over at Sacred Lynx?"

15:27.405 --> 15:30.172
You just went on a public
tirade against the terrorists

15:30.208 --> 15:32.206
that were laundering
money through your movies.

15:32.242 --> 15:34.445
Do you still think
today was an accident?

15:37.814 --> 15:39.815
Wait, so...

15:39.851 --> 15:42.850
You're saying terrorists
are producing my movies?

15:42.886 --> 15:44.653
My movies are
funding terrorism?

15:44.689 --> 15:46.321
He's playing dumb.

15:46.357 --> 15:47.623
Sadly,
I don't think he is.

15:47.659 --> 15:48.856
He's not that good
of an an actor.

15:48.892 --> 15:51.229
You shut your mouth.

15:54.832 --> 15:56.797
Man, Booky...

15:56.833 --> 15:59.567
The guy that I met on the set?
What about him?

15:59.603 --> 16:01.169
I knew he was way in
over his head.

16:01.205 --> 16:03.337
After a couple
of his movies bombed,

16:03.373 --> 16:04.273
he fell into debt.

16:04.309 --> 16:05.407
I told him
to cut your losses.

16:05.443 --> 16:06.807
"Why don't you
produce some indies?"

16:06.843 --> 16:08.210
He was over here
getting excited

16:08.246 --> 16:09.912
about some investors
from Moscow.

16:09.948 --> 16:12.246
Niko and The Brigada.

16:12.282 --> 16:13.682
First came Niko
and his money,

16:13.718 --> 16:15.283
and then all of his
list of demands.

16:15.319 --> 16:16.351
Like what?

16:16.387 --> 16:20.455
He was just very particular
about the sets we build

16:20.491 --> 16:23.258
and the props we use.

16:23.294 --> 16:25.460
Locations, that...
that was his big thing.

16:25.496 --> 16:27.863
He was always specific about
the... the cities we shoot in.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.398
You know, some made sense.

16:29.434 --> 16:31.200
Big cities,
big production value.

16:31.236 --> 16:32.634
But others, I've
never even heard of.

16:32.670 --> 16:36.571
Kursk, "Gronzy," Omsk.

16:36.607 --> 16:38.440
You know where Omsk is?

16:38.476 --> 16:39.575
In Siberia.

16:39.611 --> 16:42.476
The house he rented me
was a barn.

16:42.512 --> 16:43.482
A barn.

16:44.848 --> 16:46.815
Those cities that
Keith's never heard of...

16:46.851 --> 16:48.749
all home to major
weapons plants.

16:48.785 --> 16:49.985
How major are we talking?

16:50.021 --> 16:51.419
Mass destruction.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.889
High-yield explosives,
chemical weapons.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.590
That's what we on the dark web
call "the good stuff."

16:55.626 --> 16:58.360
The Brigada uses
international film productions

16:58.396 --> 17:01.996
to transport WMDs to the cities
where they set them off.

17:02.032 --> 17:03.698
And now they're
filming in New York.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.233
Where did the production
move from?

17:05.270 --> 17:06.734
Omsk, where
the CIA believes

17:06.771 --> 17:08.837
Russia manufactures
cyclosarin,

17:08.873 --> 17:10.539
a nerve agent
with no antidote.

17:10.575 --> 17:13.708
A single drop could kill
everyone in this room.

17:24.722 --> 17:26.253
Hey, Niko!

17:26.290 --> 17:28.256
Did you try
to kill Keith?

17:28.291 --> 17:30.926
He's been talking
to the press.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.026
He's an actor!

17:32.062 --> 17:33.794
It's his job to
talk to the press!

17:33.830 --> 17:35.530
Not about us.

17:35.566 --> 17:38.633
We are too close to
let his mouth sink us now.

17:38.669 --> 17:40.636
Close?
Close to what?

17:40.672 --> 17:43.671
Should I ask what you're
really moving here?

17:43.707 --> 17:44.973
No, you shouldn't.

17:45.009 --> 17:48.010
You just control your star
and run your business.

17:48.046 --> 17:51.550
Or I'll find someone else
to do business with, got it?

18:05.174 --> 18:06.777
We gotta figure out
what Niko's target is.

18:06.813 --> 18:09.579
- If he has cyclosarin...
- Not "if"... a CIA wiretap

18:09.615 --> 18:12.989
just confirmed that 12 canisters
of the gas are missing from Omsk.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.815
He's moving it
in props and sets.

18:14.851 --> 18:16.680
The studio has to be
his staging area.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.283
Booky's leverage box.

18:18.319 --> 18:19.989
Booky's a shark.

18:20.025 --> 18:22.458
He records everybody's phone
conversations for leverage.

18:22.494 --> 18:24.689
So, if we get our hands
on those recordings,

18:24.725 --> 18:27.225
we can work out which props
and sets Niko's using.

18:27.261 --> 18:28.994
That's gonna
be a problem.

18:29.030 --> 18:30.562
He keeps all the recordings
in a safe in his office.

18:30.598 --> 18:32.229
It's not a problem
for Patterson.

18:32.265 --> 18:33.230
I've seen it in action.

18:33.266 --> 18:35.467
That safe only responds
to Booky's biometrics,

18:35.503 --> 18:36.601
starting with
his thumbprint.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.069
Not a problem.

18:38.105 --> 18:39.204
Then it asks for
three voice prompts,

18:39.240 --> 18:40.772
which only responds
to his voice.

18:40.808 --> 18:42.140
Not a problem.

18:42.176 --> 18:44.311
The voice prompts
are randomly generated.

18:45.713 --> 18:47.746
Well, that could
be a problem.

18:47.782 --> 18:49.346
I mean, if we don't know
what the words will be,

18:49.382 --> 18:52.283
we can't capture Booky
saying it in advance.

18:52.319 --> 18:54.018
Um... I have an idea.

18:54.054 --> 18:56.021
It involves some
light role playing.

18:56.057 --> 18:58.026
Of course it does.

19:08.135 --> 19:10.435
This city's been like
a second home to me.

19:10.471 --> 19:12.303
My family summers here.

19:12.339 --> 19:14.439
You know you're rich when
you use seasons as verbs.

19:14.475 --> 19:17.042
Well, you're not exactly
poor yourself anymore.

19:17.078 --> 19:19.510
Well, I'm poor
where it counts.

19:19.546 --> 19:21.312
I mean, last night a waiter
asked me what wine I wanted

19:21.348 --> 19:23.415
with my swordfish...
completely froze up.

19:23.451 --> 19:25.150
White burgundy.

19:25.186 --> 19:28.319
Well...
what about halibut?

19:28.355 --> 19:29.320
Pinot grigio.

19:29.356 --> 19:30.487
- Octopus.
- Pinot noir.

19:30.523 --> 19:32.590
- M&Ms?
- Diet Coke.

19:33.627 --> 19:35.592
My dad
trained me well.

19:35.628 --> 19:37.528
So, your dad's
a wine guy?

19:37.564 --> 19:39.064
<i>The</i> wine guy.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.431
Had you stuck around
the auction that night,

19:40.467 --> 19:42.467
you would've heard
my famous wine story.

19:42.503 --> 19:43.802
Really?
Well, do tell.

19:43.838 --> 19:46.804
Well, when I was 14,

19:46.840 --> 19:48.172
my parents were having
a dinner party

19:48.208 --> 19:49.807
with some other
couples and...

19:49.843 --> 19:52.177
they caught me and
a friend sneaking upstairs

19:52.213 --> 19:54.245
with a bottle we stole
from their wine cellar.

19:54.281 --> 19:56.081
And my dad
comes up to me,

19:56.117 --> 19:57.282
and in front of
the whole party

19:57.318 --> 19:59.117
he takes the bottle
out of my hand.

19:59.153 --> 20:01.419
I'm completely terrified.

20:01.455 --> 20:02.786
And then he asks what
we're planning to eat.

20:02.822 --> 20:04.189
I say, "Pizza."

20:04.225 --> 20:06.557
And he just looks
at me and says...

20:06.593 --> 20:09.526
"This is too full-bodied.
Get a Chianti."

20:11.165 --> 20:13.531
That was my first
lesson in wine pairings.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.166
A forgiving parent.

20:15.202 --> 20:17.267
Must be nice
having one of those.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.536
Yeah.

20:19.572 --> 20:21.272
What's your family like?

20:21.308 --> 20:23.211
A little bit different
than yours.

20:25.779 --> 20:27.411
Booky
Bentley, please hold.

20:28.415 --> 20:30.547
Booky Bentley,
please hold.

20:34.788 --> 20:36.554
Stop it.

20:36.590 --> 20:37.621
What?

20:37.657 --> 20:38.760
Your leg.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.692
Sorry, it's my first
movie pitch.

20:41.728 --> 20:42.794
You only get one shot.

20:42.830 --> 20:43.894
It's not a real pitch.

20:43.930 --> 20:46.296
It is if they buy it!

20:46.332 --> 20:47.098
Ow, jeez!

20:47.134 --> 20:49.167
So sorry I'm late.
I'm always late.

20:49.203 --> 20:51.736
I always apologize,
and it never sounds sincere.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.705
You must be Rich and Jane.

20:53.741 --> 20:54.839
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hi, there.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.507
How are you?
Booky Bentley.

20:56.543 --> 20:57.742
So, Rich...

20:57.778 --> 20:59.744
Keith tells me you've
got a hell of a story.

20:59.780 --> 21:04.548
Yes, it's "The Social Network"
meets "Catch Me if You Can"...

21:04.584 --> 21:06.517
meets "Speed."

21:06.553 --> 21:08.785
Well, those are certainly
three movie titles.

21:08.821 --> 21:10.721
And Jane, what do you...

21:10.757 --> 21:12.356
Uh, Rich's manager.

21:12.392 --> 21:13.591
I manage him.

21:13.627 --> 21:15.293
Hmm. I bet you do.

21:15.329 --> 21:17.461
So, anyone need anything
before we start?

21:17.497 --> 21:18.330
Water? Water?

21:18.366 --> 21:20.297
Water'd be great, yeah,
any kind of, uh,

21:20.333 --> 21:22.266
sparkling mineral,
nothing domestic, of course.

21:22.302 --> 21:24.302
Maybe some quartered limes
on the side, that'd be fun.

21:24.338 --> 21:26.737
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Okay.

21:27.774 --> 21:28.907
Booky's in a meeting.

21:28.943 --> 21:31.409
Mm-hmm.
I'll give him the message.

21:31.445 --> 21:32.576
Can I help you?

21:32.612 --> 21:35.647
Yeah, I, uh, think I parked
my car a little too close

21:35.683 --> 21:37.818
to Booky's Aston Martin,
and when I opened the door...

21:38.849 --> 21:39.617
What did you do?

21:39.653 --> 21:40.855
It's pretty banged up.

21:51.965 --> 21:54.798
Okay, there's the award
Keith told us to look for.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.367
All right,
do your thing.

21:56.403 --> 21:57.802
I don't know
if Jane told you,

21:57.838 --> 22:00.772
but she called me off
the daughter search.

22:00.808 --> 22:03.240
Okay. If that's
what she wants...

22:03.276 --> 22:04.374
Okay,
it's just that I...

22:04.410 --> 22:06.244
I had already cast out
a few lines, and...

22:06.280 --> 22:08.412
and one of them
caught something.

22:08.448 --> 22:09.781
It's not a lot.

22:09.817 --> 22:11.515
But it's still
a lead to pursue.

22:12.653 --> 22:13.785
Giving it to her
doesn't feel right,

22:13.821 --> 22:15.253
but neither does
sitting on it.

22:15.289 --> 22:17.522
I should give it
to her, right?

22:17.558 --> 22:19.756
Look... why don't you
just give it to me?

22:19.792 --> 22:21.258
All right?
I'll look over it.

22:21.294 --> 22:22.392
I mean, she's already
hurting so much.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.961
There's no point
in making it worse

22:23.997 --> 22:25.729
if it turns out
to be nothing.

22:26.934 --> 22:27.931
Got it.

22:39.045 --> 22:41.712
Title card:
"Constantinople, 1870."

22:41.748 --> 22:43.680
We follow a stray cat
through an open air market

22:43.716 --> 22:45.283
to find a little girl,
the only daughter

22:45.319 --> 22:46.551
of a humble sheep herder,

22:46.587 --> 22:50.021
who dreams one day
of coming to America.

22:50.057 --> 22:53.358
I'm sorry, I thought this story
was about a super hacker?

22:53.394 --> 22:55.493
Oh, it is, but to
understand Rich Dotcom,

22:55.529 --> 22:57.996
you must first understand
Great Grandmother Dotcom.

22:58.032 --> 23:00.364
The dear angel who guides me
from beyond the grave.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.498
<i>Rich, Jane...</i>

23:01.534 --> 23:03.638
Here comes
the first voice prompt.

23:04.838 --> 23:06.007
Excalibur.

23:07.608 --> 23:09.573
The most remarkable thing
about this little girl,

23:09.609 --> 23:12.276
is that she is an avid
sword collector.

23:12.312 --> 23:13.611
And the jewel
of her collection,

23:13.647 --> 23:17.015
which she shows off at market
every Sunday is, um...

23:17.051 --> 23:18.583
Oh, what's that, uh, one sword?

23:18.619 --> 23:20.017
You know,
the one from the stone,

23:20.053 --> 23:22.519
from the myth,
that he pulls out?

23:22.555 --> 23:24.054
Excalibur?

23:24.090 --> 23:26.261
That's the one.

23:27.461 --> 23:28.660
<i>Excalibur?</i>

23:29.696 --> 23:30.697
And there you go.

23:31.998 --> 23:33.064
Here comes
the second prompt.

23:35.636 --> 23:37.437
Poodle skirt?

23:38.605 --> 23:40.671
Now we pull a Soderbergh
and jump forward in time

23:40.707 --> 23:42.006
for absolutely no reason.

23:42.042 --> 23:43.507
It's the 1950s.

23:43.543 --> 23:45.375
The little girl
is now 70 years old.

23:45.411 --> 23:47.644
But she's finally
made it to America.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.547
And when you think of 1950s
America, you think of...

23:50.583 --> 23:52.850
The Korean War?

23:52.886 --> 23:54.986
Yes, also...

23:55.022 --> 23:57.388
Sock hops, malt shops,

23:57.424 --> 24:00.324
saddle shoes,
the Mashed Potato...

24:00.360 --> 24:02.893
I get it, I get it.
It's the '50s.

24:02.929 --> 24:03.928
So, spare me
every minute detail

24:03.964 --> 24:05.662
and just stick to the story.

24:05.698 --> 24:08.865
We'll skip past the egg creams
and the poodle skirts, okay?

24:08.901 --> 24:10.535
<i>Poodle skirts.</i>

24:10.571 --> 24:12.307
Here comes
the final prompt.

24:15.576 --> 24:17.408
You wanna know my favorite
flavor of egg cream, Booky?

24:17.444 --> 24:18.642
You're gonna love this.

24:18.678 --> 24:21.079
Uh-oh! Looks like
I'm needed on set.

24:21.115 --> 24:22.612
So let's put a pin
in this for now.

24:22.648 --> 24:24.381
Intrigued though I am
to hear about

24:24.417 --> 24:25.983
your favorite
fountain drink flavors.

24:26.019 --> 24:28.652
Just give me a second. It's gonna
dovetail right into the climax.

24:28.688 --> 24:29.623
Butterscotch.

24:31.457 --> 24:33.593
It's my personal mantra,
and now it's yours.

24:34.994 --> 24:36.361
Butterscotch.

24:36.397 --> 24:37.764
May peace be with you.

24:40.501 --> 24:41.631
<i>Butterscotch.</i>

24:44.003 --> 24:46.103
- Yes...
- Okay.

24:46.139 --> 24:48.573
Let's reschedule this
real, real soon.

24:48.609 --> 24:50.140
Because this has
been a delightful

24:50.176 --> 24:51.875
not-waste of my time.

24:51.911 --> 24:54.014
Good-bye forever.

24:56.683 --> 24:58.749
Patterson, Weller,
Booky's on the move.

24:58.785 --> 25:00.384
Get out of there now.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.519
What the hell?

25:02.555 --> 25:05.957
Alise, reception
is empty <i>again!</i>

25:05.993 --> 25:07.725
We got Booky's
recordings.

25:07.761 --> 25:09.060
Patterson, get
it back to the lab.

25:09.096 --> 25:10.460
Start going through 'em.

25:10.496 --> 25:12.766
Weller, Jane,
head to the studio.

25:14.767 --> 25:17.701
So, is this another
meaningful place for you?

25:17.737 --> 25:20.036
Not yet, but...

25:20.072 --> 25:22.442
I'm hopeful.

25:26.914 --> 25:28.112
Hey, hey, hey.

25:29.515 --> 25:31.084
You don't wanna do this.

25:42.128 --> 25:44.762
Tom! Tom, are you okay?

25:46.567 --> 25:47.535
Help!

25:51.856 --> 25:54.518
Hey, Patterson pinpoint
the cyclosarin yet?

25:54.554 --> 25:57.333
No, not yet, they're still going
through all the recordings.

25:57.369 --> 26:00.329
It's gonna take 'em a while,
so... let's start searching.

26:00.365 --> 26:02.031
All right, it would
need to be in a place

26:02.067 --> 26:03.733
that's large, ventilated,

26:03.769 --> 26:05.367
that on one could
stumble in uninvited.

26:05.403 --> 26:06.836
That's every building
on this lot.

26:06.872 --> 26:08.905
Jane, Rich, you two
take the west side.

26:08.941 --> 26:10.706
- I'll take the east.
- Uh, I should have a gun, right?

26:10.742 --> 26:11.941
I mean, we're in the field.
We're hunting terrorists.

26:11.977 --> 26:13.242
You can't have a gun, Rich.

26:13.278 --> 26:14.844
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's okay.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.780
No, I know every inch of
this place, you need me.

26:17.816 --> 26:18.580
Fine.

26:18.616 --> 26:19.816
And I think I should
get a gun, too.

26:19.852 --> 26:22.985
No. I've seen you
with a weapon.

26:23.021 --> 26:24.020
You're not getting one.

26:24.056 --> 26:24.788
- No?
- No.

26:24.824 --> 26:26.755
Keith wasn't kidding.

26:26.791 --> 26:28.724
Booky records all of his
conversations with everyone,

26:28.760 --> 26:30.225
so Zapata and Patterson
have a ton to sift through.

26:30.261 --> 26:31.860
And Weller and Jane?

26:31.896 --> 26:33.262
Uh, they're already
at the studio

26:33.298 --> 26:34.364
searching with Rich.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.732
And Niko?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.265
Has no idea we're
even onto him.

26:37.301 --> 26:39.402
It's like you were
born to do this.

26:39.438 --> 26:40.802
Well, we still don't know

26:40.838 --> 26:42.871
where the cyclosarin
is yet, so there's that.

26:42.907 --> 26:45.008
Take the compliment.
It's free.

26:46.912 --> 26:48.977
Is there something
on your mind?

26:49.013 --> 26:52.648
Uh... yeah, it's probably
not a big deal.

26:52.684 --> 26:54.282
But it's about
the Loewe case.

26:56.121 --> 26:58.421
I've been reviewing the Justice
Department cases and...

26:58.457 --> 27:01.124
you didn't mention being
on the UGA Law Review

27:01.160 --> 27:02.759
with Loewe's first wife.

27:02.795 --> 27:05.160
It's funny.

27:05.196 --> 27:07.763
Their divorce
was so long ago...

27:07.799 --> 27:10.133
the connection
slipped my mind.

27:10.169 --> 27:11.934
It's been decades

27:11.970 --> 27:14.102
since I spoke to anyone
in the family.

27:14.138 --> 27:16.406
Well, still should've been
disclosed, though, right?

27:16.442 --> 27:18.644
I suppose.

27:19.845 --> 27:21.444
Although, mentioning it

27:21.480 --> 27:23.780
could've gotten Loewe
special treatment.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.048
And that guy
should rot in prison

27:25.084 --> 27:27.750
for as long as possible,
wouldn't you say?

27:27.786 --> 27:29.318
Right, right,
which is why I said,

27:29.354 --> 27:30.686
it probably isn't
a big deal.

27:30.722 --> 27:32.090
Just wanted to mention it.

27:44.336 --> 27:45.801
All right,
be on the lookout

27:45.837 --> 27:48.804
for anything
out of the ordinary.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.239
You know
what I mean.

27:50.275 --> 27:52.340
You know, I couldn't help
but overhear you and Patterson

27:52.376 --> 27:54.810
talking about,
uh, Jane Junior?

27:54.846 --> 27:56.311
I really don't want
to talk about it, Rich.

27:56.347 --> 27:57.914
I get it, okay,
I really do.

27:57.950 --> 27:59.816
I mean, I'm terrified that
there's a little Dicky Dotcom

27:59.852 --> 28:01.050
out there
that I don't know about.

28:01.086 --> 28:02.752
Because of
the child support?

28:02.788 --> 28:04.087
No, because a soothsayer
once told me I'd be murdered

28:04.123 --> 28:05.088
by somebody with baby hands.

28:05.124 --> 28:07.823
Don't worry about it,
but, uh, you know my pitch

28:07.859 --> 28:10.425
about the little Turkish girl
who dreams of America?

28:10.461 --> 28:11.493
That wasn't about
my great grandma.

28:11.529 --> 28:12.494
That was about you.

28:12.530 --> 28:13.963
Oh, this should be good.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.130
See, I figure
you're on a journey,

28:15.166 --> 28:16.031
just like that girl,

28:16.067 --> 28:18.333
and maybe your "America"
is your daughter.

28:18.369 --> 28:20.136
Maybe it isn't,
I don't know, but, uh...

28:20.172 --> 28:21.971
I just feel like your story
deserves a happy ending.

28:22.007 --> 28:23.473
Well, in case
you haven't noticed,

28:23.509 --> 28:25.340
I'm not exactly
the happy ending type.

28:25.376 --> 28:27.342
Jane... look at me.

28:27.378 --> 28:28.810
I used to be a bad guy.

28:28.846 --> 28:30.480
Now I'm a good guy
because of you.

28:30.516 --> 28:31.981
And if you can give me
a happy ending,

28:32.017 --> 28:34.153
shouldn't you try
to give one to yourself?

28:37.321 --> 28:39.121
Well, I...

28:43.060 --> 28:44.029
Hey!

28:46.932 --> 28:49.264
Thank you, but you
really didn't have to.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.434
In fact, I should probably
get back to my hotel.

28:51.470 --> 28:53.770
Well, you shouldn't
be alone

28:53.806 --> 28:56.004
when you're recovering
from a concussion.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.773
Oh, is that what
the doctor said?

28:57.809 --> 29:00.777
No, it's what I say.

29:00.813 --> 29:02.477
Besides, you got banged up
protecting me.

29:02.513 --> 29:07.049
The least I can do is let you
stay here and be taken care of.

29:07.085 --> 29:09.851
I don't know, this
isn't really my style.

29:09.887 --> 29:12.954
Yeah, it's nobody's style,
except my father's.

29:12.990 --> 29:14.890
You know, every inch
from the basement to the view

29:14.926 --> 29:16.192
is designed to intimidate.

29:16.228 --> 29:18.094
That doesn't
sound much like a man

29:18.130 --> 29:22.168
who let his teenage daughter
steal a bottle of wine.

29:24.102 --> 29:26.068
You know,
the part I don't tell

29:26.104 --> 29:29.571
is that he didn't speak to me
for two months afterwards.

29:29.607 --> 29:32.908
I cried and...
said I was sorry.

29:32.944 --> 29:36.078
Begged him to punish me
and get it over with, but...

29:36.114 --> 29:38.214
nothing.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.948
And then one day,
his Benz was waiting for me

29:39.984 --> 29:43.519
outside of my school,
and when I got in, he said...

29:43.555 --> 29:45.887
"Never forget
what it feels like

29:45.923 --> 29:48.827
to lose the respect
of your father."

29:50.194 --> 29:53.963
And then, uh,
we drove home and...

29:53.999 --> 29:56.134
and never talked
about it again.

29:57.301 --> 29:58.835
That's awful.

29:58.871 --> 30:01.404
Well, we're...
we're very close now.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.973
Still...

30:04.009 --> 30:05.841
Still.

30:05.877 --> 30:07.909
Well, thank you.

30:07.945 --> 30:10.012
For all of this.

30:10.048 --> 30:11.284
Thank you.

30:12.416 --> 30:14.019
You were amazing today.

30:33.605 --> 30:34.941
Got it!

30:36.040 --> 30:37.572
Can you be a little
more specific?

30:37.608 --> 30:39.341
I found a sample
of Niko's voice

30:39.377 --> 30:41.877
and coded a script
to automate the search.

30:41.913 --> 30:43.111
In a minute,
we should know

30:43.147 --> 30:45.013
where Niko is moving
those weapons.

30:45.049 --> 30:46.381
Good... because I've
been waiting a minute

30:46.417 --> 30:48.286
to show you something.

30:51.289 --> 30:53.289
Oh, okay, well, we're
still working on a case.

30:53.325 --> 30:55.928
We should probably wait
to drink it till after work.

30:57.930 --> 31:01.429
Ooh... I see.

31:01.465 --> 31:04.165
So we can get the metal
tattoo disc out of here.

31:04.201 --> 31:05.467
Put whatever
you want inside

31:05.503 --> 31:06.903
and it still pours
and everything.

31:06.939 --> 31:09.070
Okay, we don't stop the disc

31:09.106 --> 31:10.505
from triggering
the metal detector.

31:10.541 --> 31:11.973
We disguise it.

31:13.211 --> 31:14.310
Oh, hey!

31:14.346 --> 31:16.512
So, such good news.

31:16.548 --> 31:18.047
Just stop it!

31:18.083 --> 31:19.581
I don't know what you guys
are up to,

31:19.617 --> 31:22.184
but if this has anything to do
with Hirst, you gotta drop it.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.586
- Reade...
- Don't "Reade" me.

31:23.622 --> 31:25.288
- Reade...
- What did I just say?

31:25.324 --> 31:26.955
No, no, no, it...
it's my audio scrubber.

31:26.991 --> 31:28.390
It just found something.

31:30.996 --> 31:32.928
<i>Weller, Jane?</i>

31:32.964 --> 31:34.195
<i>It looks like Niko is moving</i>

31:34.231 --> 31:36.598
his contraband in the sets
of a, uh, movie

31:36.634 --> 31:38.466
called "Wings of Icarus."

31:38.502 --> 31:40.703
Keith, where's
"The Wings of Icarus" filming?

31:40.739 --> 31:42.471
I've never even heard
of that movie.

31:42.507 --> 31:43.705
He doesn't know it.

31:43.741 --> 31:44.973
That's because
it's not real.

31:45.009 --> 31:47.009
Created just for smuggling.

31:47.045 --> 31:50.111
Some sets should be in
the Studio Annex, Building 3B.

31:50.147 --> 31:51.347
<i>That's where
the cyclosarin should be.</i>

31:51.383 --> 31:53.214
Copy that.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.183
Keith, jump out.

31:54.219 --> 31:55.617
Okay, what do you
need me to do?

31:55.653 --> 31:57.019
- You stay here.
- Hey!

31:57.055 --> 31:58.454
Jane, you got that?

31:58.490 --> 32:00.259
Copy, meet you there.

32:07.566 --> 32:08.664
We're too late.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.133
The cyclosarin's
already on the move.

32:11.169 --> 32:14.073
The attack's
already in motion.

32:17.157 --> 32:18.296
We just missed 'em.

32:18.332 --> 32:19.836
You can tell that
from the dust?

32:19.872 --> 32:22.224
No, I'm just trying
to stay optimistic.

32:22.260 --> 32:23.709
Where are the weapons?
Are they gone already?!

32:23.745 --> 32:25.368
Keith, I told you
to stay back!

32:34.669 --> 32:36.171
Keith! Stay down!

32:38.206 --> 32:39.242
Uhh!

32:40.309 --> 32:41.640
Six, seven...

32:41.676 --> 32:43.308
Is he out of bullets?

32:43.344 --> 32:44.313
No.

32:47.582 --> 32:49.084
Now he is.

32:51.453 --> 32:53.285
Jane!

32:54.188 --> 32:55.521
- Oh...
- Patterson...

32:55.557 --> 32:57.156
call us an ambulance!

32:57.192 --> 32:58.658
Keith's been shot.

33:02.263 --> 33:04.162
Uh, no, no flashes please, guys.

33:04.198 --> 33:06.101
We don't wanna ruin the scene.

33:30.059 --> 33:32.195
Shooter is down
and out.

33:34.562 --> 33:36.396
But he's got
a vendor permit.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.165
For the Blue and Red
StreetFest.

33:39.201 --> 33:40.733
That's tonight.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.200
It's put on by charitable
foundations

33:42.236 --> 33:43.602
of the NYPD
and Fire Department.

33:43.638 --> 33:45.571
It's outdoors,
in the middle of the city,

33:45.607 --> 33:48.106
with thousands of people
attending, including the mayor.

33:48.142 --> 33:50.075
And hundreds of cops
and firefighters.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.210
How do you make a terrorist
attack worse?

33:52.246 --> 33:54.447
You make it so the first
responders can't respond.

33:54.483 --> 33:56.716
Niko is planning to kneecap
local authorities

33:56.752 --> 33:59.051
before setting up operations.

33:59.087 --> 34:01.089
It's the perfect
Ground Zero.

34:02.090 --> 34:03.355
What exactly
is this permit?

34:03.391 --> 34:05.091
It was obtained
by Sacred Lynx Productions

34:05.127 --> 34:08.393
<i>to distribute movie food
from hot dog and popcorn carts.</i>

34:08.429 --> 34:10.362
They're gonna hide the
cyclosarin in the food carts.

34:10.398 --> 34:12.364
The prop house is full
of stuff like that.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.533
Jane, you meet me
at the prop house.

34:14.569 --> 34:16.502
- Rich, put pressure on that!
- Yeah.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.270
- Take care of him! Don't let him die!
- All right!

34:18.306 --> 34:20.308
And I'll send agents
to the StreetFest.

34:22.777 --> 34:25.511
Jane, Jane, stop, stop.

34:25.547 --> 34:27.312
Remember, we can't
shoot towards those carts

34:27.348 --> 34:29.818
'cause of the cyclosarin.

34:32.554 --> 34:36.154
Chemical weapons? You brought
chemical weapons onto my lot?!

34:36.190 --> 34:38.790
Don't go out.
Booky can I.D. us.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.725
Come on, Booky,
go back inside.

34:40.761 --> 34:42.527
- ...important person as...
- Shut up!

34:42.563 --> 34:43.629
Okay.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.498
FBI!

34:45.534 --> 34:46.699
Oh, thank God.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.676
Go behind there... go!

35:06.221 --> 35:07.587
Gun powder, propane.

35:07.623 --> 35:10.189
A flamethrower.

35:10.225 --> 35:12.357
Great, more things
we can't shoot at.

35:12.393 --> 35:13.859
This is pretty crazy, huh?

35:13.895 --> 35:15.828
This morning you're like
this untouchable movie star.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.529
And now we're best friends
and I'm saving your life.

35:17.565 --> 35:18.797
How's that for pressure,
by the way?

35:18.833 --> 35:20.399
- It's a bit much.
- Shh, shh, shh.

35:20.435 --> 35:22.567
The medics are coming,
it's okay.

35:23.804 --> 35:25.605
Down.

35:25.641 --> 35:26.906
Down!

35:26.942 --> 35:28.344
Down!

35:39.621 --> 35:40.723
Uhh!

35:52.201 --> 35:53.799
Nothing in here is real.

35:53.835 --> 35:55.404
Uhh! Agh!

36:17.558 --> 36:19.461
The trucks are about
to pull away!

36:22.563 --> 36:23.696
FBI!

36:28.869 --> 36:32.340
Reade! We need a perimeter
around the studio!

36:33.708 --> 36:35.578
Don't let anything
off this lot!

36:40.248 --> 36:41.350
Rich!

36:53.328 --> 36:56.828
Oh, my God, this is so much
better than a gun.

36:56.864 --> 36:59.234
Put it down, Rich.

37:07.545 --> 37:09.799
Hope I wasn't too rough
with you earlier.

37:09.835 --> 37:11.170
No, you were perfect.

37:15.719 --> 37:17.685
This is not enough.

37:17.721 --> 37:19.889
It's exactly
what we agreed on.

37:21.157 --> 37:23.190
I think we need
to modify the agreement.

37:23.226 --> 37:25.759
That woman
you're stalking...

37:25.795 --> 37:27.661
you didn't tell me
who her family was.

37:27.697 --> 37:30.730
I'm gonna need hazard pay.

37:30.766 --> 37:34.168
Hazard pay or...
hush money?

37:34.204 --> 37:35.640
Is there any difference?

37:40.710 --> 37:43.310
I have other ways
to keep people quiet.

37:43.346 --> 37:44.311
Uhh!

37:53.824 --> 37:56.891
My last tip
as your FBI consultant.

37:56.927 --> 37:59.427
When a federal agent
tells you to stay back,

37:59.463 --> 38:00.927
you gotta
stay the hell back.

38:00.963 --> 38:02.362
- Last tip?
- Yeah.

38:02.398 --> 38:04.732
Come on, Kurt, I need a guy
like you on a movie set.

38:04.768 --> 38:07.201
No, I'm... I'm not
cut out for Hollywood.

38:07.237 --> 38:09.969
But if you ever, like,
need some real action,

38:10.005 --> 38:12.072
you know, you're
always welcome at the FBI.

38:12.108 --> 38:14.141
Really?

38:14.177 --> 38:15.342
No.

38:15.378 --> 38:16.342
Not at all.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.315
No.

38:20.516 --> 38:22.482
- Come here.
- Oh!

38:22.518 --> 38:24.819
Oh, jeez, your arm.
I'm so sorry.

38:24.855 --> 38:25.920
Rich, take him
to the elevator.

38:25.956 --> 38:27.822
You got it.
You all right?

38:27.858 --> 38:29.223
You know,
he shot me once.

38:29.259 --> 38:31.726
Weller, hey, uh...

38:31.762 --> 38:32.960
That lead on
Jane's daughter.

38:32.996 --> 38:34.929
The one you said
you'd look into?

38:34.965 --> 38:38.065
This nurse worked
at the maternity ward

38:38.101 --> 38:39.866
the day Jane's daughter
left the hospital.

38:39.902 --> 38:43.036
Kept her own notes, separate
from hospital records and...

38:43.072 --> 38:44.839
I know it's been
a long time,

38:44.875 --> 38:47.311
but maybe she has some details
on the adoptive parents.

38:49.146 --> 38:50.981
Can't hurt
to look into it.

39:03.126 --> 39:05.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:05.327 --> 39:07.931
Um, Jane,
there's... I...

39:14.170 --> 39:15.170
What was that for?

39:15.206 --> 39:18.973
I was just thinking
about something Rich said.

39:19.009 --> 39:20.541
Way to ruin the moment.

39:20.577 --> 39:22.108
No...

39:22.144 --> 39:25.045
We were talking about
the whole daughter thing.

39:25.081 --> 39:29.019
And he said he wants me
to find my happy ending.

39:31.054 --> 39:32.322
But I've already found it.

39:36.559 --> 39:38.195
I'll see you
in the lobby.

40:04.420 --> 40:05.451
Got a minute?

40:05.487 --> 40:07.190
For you, always.

40:09.391 --> 40:12.393
You were at the Loewe Cancer
Fund brunch last spring.

40:12.429 --> 40:15.429
I go to a lot of events.

40:15.465 --> 40:18.331
It's just...

40:18.367 --> 40:20.067
You told me you
hadn't spoken to anyone

40:20.103 --> 40:22.235
from the family
in decades.

40:22.271 --> 40:25.108
I'm just checking to make sure
that's still your recollection.

40:27.409 --> 40:32.179
Trust is the cornerstone
of our work here.

40:32.215 --> 40:36.884
Trust from the people.
Trust in each other.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.085
I don't need to tell you
how critical it is

40:39.121 --> 40:41.554
to maintain that trust.

40:41.590 --> 40:45.458
No, you don't, which is why I'm
just asking for some clarity here.

40:45.494 --> 40:50.531
Your "indiscretion"
with drugs two years ago

40:50.567 --> 40:52.900
could've
completely derailed

40:52.936 --> 40:54.935
your promotion
to assistant director.

40:54.971 --> 40:59.239
But I... made sure
that would never happen.

40:59.275 --> 41:02.275
In fact, I fast-tracked
your appointment.

41:02.311 --> 41:05.112
Because I trust you.

41:05.148 --> 41:08.514
FBI drug tests
miss things sometimes,

41:08.550 --> 41:09.920
but I don't.

41:14.123 --> 41:16.991
Relax, Reade.
I protect my people.

41:17.027 --> 41:18.958
You did some
