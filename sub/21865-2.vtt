02:36.423 --> 02:37.758
I wake up, and...

02:39.192 --> 02:40.861
You want to sit down,
put your things down?

02:48.702 --> 02:50.937
Um, okay.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.440
So, what do you mean, you don't
know how to be "normal"?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.875
All right. So,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.643
ever since I got back
from Mexico, it's...

02:56.643 --> 02:59.613
I think we're all on the same
page that I'm healthier, right?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.681
I'm fixed.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.783

03:04.418 --> 03:05.519
Okay, whatever.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.620
The point is, I'm normal.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.721
Not a fan of that word.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.889
Okay, that's
your own issues.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.125
What do normal people do?

03:12.125 --> 03:13.527
What do they do?

03:13.527 --> 03:16.163
Uh, they‐they get up,

03:16.163 --> 03:18.165
they go to work,

03:18.165 --> 03:19.533
they socialize?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.867
They date.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.703
Eh, three out of four's not bad.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.072
You're interested in dating.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.908
All right, so...

03:27.908 --> 03:30.444
I'm cleaning guns, sharpening
knives, okay? And I see this

03:30.444 --> 03:32.546
on the floor, so I pick it
up, and I'm thinking, oh,
maybe this is a sign.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.181
Right? Maybe I
should call her.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.216
And I think maybe
I‐I'm gonna call her.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.150
But?
But.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.252
Like, wh‐what am I,
what am I gonna say?

03:39.252 --> 03:40.887
Like, you know, blah, blah,
make a bunch of small talk

03:40.887 --> 03:42.656
and ask her to dinner?
It's 5:00 in the morning,

03:42.656 --> 03:44.658
for crying out loud.
You've been up since 5:00
in the morning?

03:44.658 --> 03:47.194
Yeah, you do
seem a little...

03:47.194 --> 03:48.228
wired.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.930
I don't know. It's like,
ever since Mexico,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.232
I... it's like I just don't
need that much sleep.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.633
You know? It's like,
5:00, 5:30 in the morning,

03:53.633 --> 03:55.102
boom, I'm ready to go.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.772
You think it's possible
I've gone too far?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.307
You know? To the other side?

04:00.307 --> 04:04.111
Like, maybe I'm... too normal?

04:04.111 --> 04:07.147
Safe to say I...
I don't share that concern.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.123
Death by Jacuzzi.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.191
I can think of worse ways to go.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.259
So who was this guy?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.327
BAILEY:
Daniel Harris.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.496
38, plastic surgeon.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.798
Looks like a massive coronary.
So possibly not even a homicide,

04:24.798 --> 04:26.800
considering all the blow.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.268
We're definitely dealing
with a murder here, Rog!

04:28.268 --> 04:30.403
Riggs? What's he doing here?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.872
He was here when we got here.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.507
Seriously?
First one on the scene?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.542
RIGGS:
So, here's what I know.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.843
Probable murder weapon.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.211
I'd check that
for heart attack juice.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.780
Side gate left open,
bikinis everywhere,

04:39.780 --> 04:40.881
and when I say bikinis,

04:40.881 --> 04:41.948
I mean a ton
of bikinis.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.151
And a crap‐basket
full of cocaine on the inside,

04:44.151 --> 04:45.919
so I'm thinking we need
to bring in the DEA.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.721
DEA? Hold up, wait. Time out.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.189
Are you sure
you didn't

04:49.189 --> 04:51.625
dip into that crap‐basket
full of cocaine?

04:52.492 --> 04:55.162
No, Rog.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.429
(exhales)

04:56.429 --> 04:58.198

05:06.439 --> 05:07.674
Oh, yeah, that's just nothing.

05:07.674 --> 05:08.842
Seems like a lower lumbar thing.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.801
Well, you better
get used to it, Big Rog.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.337
Think of it this way.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.873

cleared by I. A.

"Cleared" meaning
"not arrested."

scan. And by the way,

06:23.183 --> 06:25.118
nine times out of ten,
an evaluate and assess

It can't happen.

Can I get you a
coffee, or, uh,

a scone, perhaps?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.849
A scone?
(laughs softly)

06:55.849 --> 06:58.184
I'm sorry, are we having brunch?

06:58.184 --> 06:59.886
Is that what they told you
we were doing today?

06:59.886 --> 07:01.221
No, that wasn't‐‐ this is...
Hi. Martin Riggs.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.156
AVERY: This is Martin Riggs.
RIGGS:
I didn't know we had scones.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
We don't have scones.
And of course,

We should go.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.062

07:09.062 --> 07:10.363
Where are we going?
We‐We're going.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.631
It was nice meeting you.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.466
Yeah.
Mm‐hmm.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.768
Sorry about
the whole scone thing.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.236
I don't know
where that came from.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.505
MURTAUGH:
A dead man.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.207
You are looking
at a dead man.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.642
Oh, is it your back again?

07:22.642 --> 07:24.144
Here, turn around.
No, it's not that.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.645
Her.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.514
You were in the room with us.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.149
Did you feel the tension?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.218
"Hello, Roger."

07:32.218 --> 07:33.553
Her words.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.455
You talking about
the deputy chief?
Yes.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.624
We have a history, Riggs.

07:37.624 --> 07:41.528
There was a whole thing
that, uh, happened.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.897
Wow. You think
you know somebody.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.931
Yeah.

07:44.931 --> 07:49.235
I mean, we worked together,
years back, when, uh,

07:49.235 --> 07:51.137
I first became detective.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.441
On the first night, we were
sitting in a car on a stakeout,

07:54.441 --> 07:57.410
and I'm getting these vibes.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.212
Serious vibes from her.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.348
Not to be confused
with, like, regular vibes.
Right.

08:01.348 --> 08:05.285
And then, at about 2:00
in the morning,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.120
it happened.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.288
Yeah.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.422
"It"?

08:09.422 --> 08:12.292
Vibes confirmed.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.295
We both reached
to adjust the radio.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.297
And boom.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.232
Fingers touch.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.167
Riveting. What next?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.235
Nothing.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.703
She didn't move.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.106
Even though my hand
got there first,

08:26.106 --> 08:30.643
she allowed
her finger to linger.

08:30.643 --> 08:35.215
For about one and a half,
maybe even two seconds.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
So that's it.
Your fingers touched.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.518
"That's it"?
Well...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.553
Have you ever
been finger‐lingered?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.422
It's a icky feeling.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.724
And so I did what
I had to do, Riggs.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.826
I put in for a transfer
because I knew,

08:46.826 --> 08:50.630
with all those pheromones
floating around,

08:50.630 --> 08:52.499
a cop's instincts
could get compromised.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.867
Yeah.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.869
Obviously, it crushed her.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.271
Well, that's obvious.
And here we are.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.372
Intel on the dead doctor.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.407
Watch out, Bailey.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.508
Pheromones.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.843
The doctor
was definitely murdered,

09:03.843 --> 09:06.012
injected with
potassium chloride.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.815
MURTAUGH:
Hey, look at this.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.117
He was being sued
by his business partner.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.619
Motive and access
to the heart attack juice.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.220
Mm‐hmm.
Let's go talk to him.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.356
Uh, don't forget your body cams.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.524
(groans)
What?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.758
Straight from
the deputy chief.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.160
Something about transparency?
Oh, no.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.028
She wanted to make sure
you got them.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.170
WELLER: <i>Dr. Harris</i>
<i>was a gifted surgeon,</i>

09:30.170 --> 09:34.174
but his lifestyle was the
antithesis of what we do here.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
Which is what, exactly?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.177
Complete wellness.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.380
We do top‐end cosmetic surgery,
massage rehab,

09:40.380 --> 09:41.781
longevity,
anti‐aging treatments.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.116
Anti‐aging?
Mm‐hmm.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.317
Who the heck wants
to live forever?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.585
I do.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.253
I wish my back
was 20 years younger.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.655
We're breaking ground.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.557
With growth hormones
and steroid therapies.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.758
Hmm.
Yeah.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.126
Growth hormones
and steroid therapy.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.260
Drug connection.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.528
Have a good day.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.696
And stay healthy.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.231
Let me guess: she's 96.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.132
Excuse me?

09:59.132 --> 10:02.068
Don't mind him.
He's anti‐health.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.673
Come on, Riggs.
Body cam.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.411
Who are those guys?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.712
I have no idea.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.214
Probably new patients?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.115
Um...

10:15.115 --> 10:16.850
You have my information,
and, Detective,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.485
you should stop by
our back pain clinic

10:18.485 --> 10:19.786
for a complimentary
session.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.321
Oh, I‐I couldn't
take advantage of...

10:21.321 --> 10:23.189
you know, job conflict.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.424
I see. It's not a graft,

10:24.424 --> 10:27.093
it's an AARP special
for anyone over 50.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.566
AARP. You hear that?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.168
Come on, Rog.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.337
You know the secret to youth
is catching bad guys.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.705
Let's go.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.574
Hey, Riggs,
remember: body cams.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.909
By the book.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.512
Always.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.746
Hey, is the Fountain
of Youth back there?

10:46.746 --> 10:48.114
We were looking for it.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.150

(groans)

11:49.242 --> 11:51.811
MURTAUGH: And so, uh, here
I am, methodically searching

11:51.811 --> 11:54.447
the grounds
for a suspected perp.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.216
Oh, wait, that one.
Uh‐huh.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.517
And‐and‐and now I'm, uh,

11:57.517 --> 11:59.953
identifying myself,
you see, as a, as a

11:59.953 --> 12:01.221
peace officer.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.789
And then right
there, I'm issuing

12:02.789 --> 12:04.724
verbal warning
to said perp.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.192
I think I heard
it right there.
Yeah.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.194
Let's press pause on this.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.630
(Riggs clears throat)
I...

12:10.630 --> 12:12.465
No, I mean that literally.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.200
Detective, press pause.
I‐I can't watch...
Oh, I don't...

12:14.200 --> 12:17.103
Just push that one right there.
Press any button!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.673
I'll be candid.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.842
I was led to believe that

12:22.842 --> 12:25.178
Detective Riggs
was the challenge

12:25.178 --> 12:27.146
of this department.
He is.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.681
What? That‐that was before.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.216
I am normal now.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.919
The film tells
a markedly different story.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.154
Detective, if you set out

12:35.154 --> 12:36.389
to record the worst
possible footage

12:36.389 --> 12:40.393
that shows us
in the least favorable light...

12:40.393 --> 12:42.328
Well, if I, if I
may interject, ma'am.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.364
What you're not seeing
in the video

12:44.364 --> 12:46.733
is that we may have
possibly uncovered

12:46.733 --> 12:48.768
a massive drug
ring, so...

12:48.768 --> 12:51.170
Well, I wouldn't say massive
and I wouldn't say drugs.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.239
Well, there was steroids
and hormones type stuff.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.507
I mean, there was
stuff in there

12:54.507 --> 12:56.509
and I suggest that
we get the DEA.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.244
The DE... why would
we want the DEA?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.412
Why do you have a problem
with that?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.180
Why don't you just call her?
Call who?

13:01.180 --> 13:02.782
You know who.
What? Wh‐Why do you
slouch when you say it?

13:02.782 --> 13:08.121
I, uh, I happen to be a fan
of interagency cooperation.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.389
Ah.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.823
Riggs,

13:10.823 --> 13:12.525
make the call.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.410
Detective Riggs.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.678
Hey.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.147
You got a haircut.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.182
Oh. I did it myself.
Thanks for noticing.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.917
Uh‐huh.
Yeah.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.585
So, what's up?

13:39.585 --> 13:40.920
Last I heard,
you were headed south.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.891
Well, that's actually
why I came.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.460
We, uh, missed you
at the parade.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.928
(clears throat)

13:48.928 --> 13:50.229
You had a parade?

13:50.229 --> 13:52.598
Oh, a celebration, really.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.834
You know, the end
of the Flores cartel.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.803
I don't know if you heard,
but I kind of went down there

13:56.803 --> 13:57.937
and I just handled that whole

13:57.937 --> 14:00.173
Mexican drug trafficking
thing, so...

14:00.173 --> 14:01.441
(clucks tongue)

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
You do know there's more
than one cartel.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.645
That can't be true or they
wouldn't have you writing up...

14:05.645 --> 14:07.313
Hey.

14:07.313 --> 14:11.851
Phone conversations
with weed dealers?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.519
Uh, I'm off cartel duty.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.456
They benched you.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.424
Oh, no. I've been benched
from the bench.

14:18.424 --> 14:22.195
Exiled. It's just me and...
tech guy, Robby.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.367
Somebody found out you
gave me the Flores file.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.135
There you go.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.204
Taking credit for everything.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.839
I am perfectly capable
of getting myself benched.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.375
Ah, well, you know, it was
an international incident,

14:35.375 --> 14:36.075
so I just...

14:36.075 --> 14:38.511
Is there a reason you came by?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.246
I did, actually.

14:40.246 --> 14:43.383
I just came by to
ask you or request

14:43.383 --> 14:47.153
the DEA's assistance
on this case.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.588
Um, might need a
whole task force deal.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.724
Uh, pretty sure
it's a major drug ring.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.226
Is that Murtaugh?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.361
Yeah, it's these stupid
cams we have to wear.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.929
So, this doctor was
killed, all right?
Okay.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.932
So, we go to his clinic
and we find these guys.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.834
Well, this guy was dead
and that guy got away,

15:01.834 --> 15:02.869
but in this room,

15:02.869 --> 15:04.771
they kept the steroids.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.806
Um, the HGH, the HCG...

15:06.806 --> 15:08.107
Stop, stop it. All right.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.376
The H‐H...
Steroids? Oh, God.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.378
Riggs, did you
really bring me this?

15:12.378 --> 15:14.414
Really... hey.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.182
Come on, this could get you
back in the game.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.884
This could be huge.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.186
These guys are
trafficking...
No, don't.
What are they dealing?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.187
Ointments and creams?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.889
Come on, I'm not the FDA.

15:22.889 --> 15:27.193
You want to do
a red dye number two bust?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.729
(sighs)

15:29.729 --> 15:32.165
Maybe I came at a bad time.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.267
Well, you are very perceptive.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.205
(clears throat)

15:39.205 --> 15:41.274

You're missing the concept,
all right?

16:12.171 --> 16:14.874
All your stuff
leaves the house with you.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.175
College is that way.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.177
I understand
the concept.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.179
Look, Claremont's
45 minutes away.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.682
What if I go
to college...
Mm‐hmm.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.217
...but live here?
(chuckles)

16:24.217 --> 16:25.751
And why would
we want that?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.119
I mean, I saw
my dorm room.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.188
No AC, cinder‐block walls.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.190
One shower for,
like, 12 guys.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.125
It's disgusting.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.361
Look, college is supposed
to be uncomfortable.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.463
All right? It's supposed
to be disgusting and smelly

16:37.463 --> 16:40.900
and the bathroom floor is always
wet and no one ever knows why.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.802
Don't you think
I'll have a better chance

16:42.802 --> 16:46.906
of academic success if
my living situation is stable?

16:46.906 --> 16:50.276
Be surrounded by
the people I love.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.213
I mean,
I‐I‐I see your point.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.915
I mean, not everything
has to change.

16:55.915 --> 16:59.452
I mean, you're gonna watch
<i>SportsCenter</i> alone every night?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.287
Who's gonna go with
you to the car wash?

17:01.287 --> 17:05.091
Admit it. It's‐it's
not a bad idea.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.225
Well, you have a...

17:06.225 --> 17:07.326
Step away from
your father.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.095
ROGER JR.:
Mom, I‐I was...

17:09.095 --> 17:10.329
TRISH: Step away
from your father

17:10.329 --> 17:12.865
and take that box
back in the truck.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.134
Yeah, put the box in the truck.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.168
Try to con me.

17:16.168 --> 17:18.170
(scoffs)
(chuckles)

17:18.170 --> 17:19.705
Yep. Mm‐hmm.
Mm‐hmm.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.108
Tell me you weren't encouraging
him to live at home.
No.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.778
(door closes)
But, Trish, don't‐don't you
think maybe it's possible

17:25.778 --> 17:28.114
that we could...
Unequivocally no.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.749
But we can keep
an eye on him.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.517
He's not smart.
Baby.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.818
Listen to me.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.121
He needs to
leave the nest.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.890
It's the best thing
for him and for you.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.892
Me? What‐what I got
to do with it?
You.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.461
Sweetie, you can
tell yourself

17:42.461 --> 17:44.797
that if RJ lives
home forever,

17:44.797 --> 17:47.433
your bones won't
get any older.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.803
(sighs)
Or you can let
him go to college

17:50.803 --> 17:54.140
and...

17:54.140 --> 17:55.408
(grunts)

17:55.408 --> 17:57.276
(laughs)

17:57.276 --> 18:00.279
...see someone
about this back.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.283
Mm‐hmm.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.358
What are you doing here?

18:12.358 --> 18:15.161
Scorsese found Russian
tattoos on our guy,

18:15.161 --> 18:16.429
so I'm looking at Russians.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.730
Still?
What, did you sleep here?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.732
It's not tomorrow yet, is it?

18:19.732 --> 18:20.866
Close enough.

18:20.866 --> 18:21.834
Listen, I can't leave here

18:21.834 --> 18:24.170
until she leaves here.
You have no excuse.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.205
You okay?
I mean,

18:26.205 --> 18:27.306
as okay as you
normally are?

18:29.308 --> 18:31.577
I think that's our caviar‐eating
Russki right there.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.881
Yep. And there's the other one.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.417
Sergei Kryev.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.319
Looks like our boys were
freelancing for the mob.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.888
AVERY: Okay, so why does
the Russian mafia

18:42.888 --> 18:44.457
kill a plastic surgeon?

18:44.457 --> 18:48.127
Mm, mm? Botched nose job
or a drug ring?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.463
I got to go talk
to that doctor again.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.098
That sounds like
fun. I'm coming.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.367
What? I'm the captain.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.102
I can still do
whatever I want.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.782
WOMAN: Mr. Murtaugh, your
massage therapist is ready.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.284
(indistinct chatter)

19:12.284 --> 19:15.388
AVERY: ...the sounds,
the smells, the people.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.124
Actually, I like
being in my office.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.431
It's early.
He may not be in.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.502
Dr. Weller, LAPD.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.437
(glass shattering)

19:46.752 --> 19:48.788
(grunts)

19:48.788 --> 19:50.156
Palmer.
Up.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.190
What are you doing?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.324
I'm arresting Sergei Kryev.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.193
Huh. This is
drug‐related.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.594
Uh‐huh.
I knew it.

19:55.594 --> 19:56.896
You've been following me.
(handcuffs tighten)

19:56.896 --> 19:58.464
Took you long enough.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.865
Eh, whatever. We got
the band back together.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.866
Are we doing this or what?

20:00.866 --> 20:01.934
We are not.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.336
What? Hey, we got a whole
task force thing going.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.671
What are you talking about?

20:05.671 --> 20:07.373
(engine starts)

20:11.811 --> 20:13.412
That Agent Palmer?

20:13.412 --> 20:15.214
Yeah.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.684
(panting): Was that...
Agent Palmer?

20:18.684 --> 20:20.152
What are you
doing here?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.387
And why are you
carrying one shoe?
Yeah.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.856
Can we just focus
on the fact

20:23.856 --> 20:26.592
that Agent Palmer
just stole our case?

20:26.592 --> 20:30.696
Huh? I mean, that is the most
underhanded, backstabbing,

20:30.696 --> 20:32.932
duplicitous agent ever.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.900
Yeah, I know.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.302
She's unbelievable.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.544
So, the three of you
went to the clinic

20:45.544 --> 20:48.547
and you lost
another suspect?

20:48.547 --> 20:50.216
Did I get that math right?

20:50.216 --> 20:51.117
Mm, mm, to be fair,

20:51.117 --> 20:52.451
we didn't lose
<i>another</i> suspect.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.453
We lost the same suspect.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.955
We really, we lost
one suspect twice.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.558
The‐‐ are those scones?
You know, I am trying

20:59.558 --> 21:02.194
to reconcile procedure here

21:02.194 --> 21:04.630
with any police
procedure anywhere.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.599
It's nice of you to join us.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.666
How was it that

21:07.666 --> 21:10.669
you arrived at the clinic
before your colleagues?

21:10.669 --> 21:14.173
Well... (sighs)
that's, uh, interesting.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.876
See, I was there,
um, on a hunch.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.777
Uh, sort of in a...

21:17.777 --> 21:21.147
undercover sort of capacity.
Right, Riggs?

21:21.147 --> 21:23.749
Oh, I no longer feel comfortable
with deception, Roger,

21:23.749 --> 21:25.217
now that I've turned
over a new leaf.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.585
He was having a massage,

21:26.585 --> 21:27.920
but he has lower
lumbar issues...
SANTOS: Oh.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.221
Don't touch my back.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.189
The deputy chief

21:30.189 --> 21:32.258
only wanted to know how
we lost the suspect.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.226
Oh, lost.
Well, we didn't lose him.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.161
He's actually
being interrogated

21:35.161 --> 21:36.228
by our task force partners.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.296
We're trying to, you know,

21:37.296 --> 21:38.597
piece together
who hired him.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.933
So, do you have a name yet?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.435
We're close‐ish.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.839
Call Palmer and insist...
(sighs)

21:46.839 --> 21:49.375
...that she gives us whatever
she gets on our prisoner.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.778
That's not how Palmer works.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.714
Look, if I push,
she shuts me out.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.250
You are already shut out.
Look,

21:58.250 --> 21:59.585
we got to find
something Palmer wants.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.687
We show it to her, right?
We tease her with it.

22:01.687 --> 22:05.291
And then it'll become her idea
to share her thing with me.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.760
I feel like I'm in the
middle of your foreplay.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.527
I don't like it.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.196
Well, you know what
that tells me?

22:10.196 --> 22:11.263
Hmm?

22:11.263 --> 22:12.665
You don't understand foreplay.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.803
Look, all we have now
is a dead body.

22:17.803 --> 22:21.340
Who was tortured
for information, all right?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.276
We get that information,
we're gold.

22:25.444 --> 22:28.214
What is the body
telling us?

22:28.214 --> 22:29.415
The body is telling us...

22:31.550 --> 22:33.719
...that it was tortured
and it really, really hurt.

22:33.719 --> 22:36.222
Oh...
Okay, so, now it's time
to make the phone call.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.290
(phone ringing)

22:38.290 --> 22:39.558
RIGGS:
Who's that?

22:39.558 --> 22:41.160
See, she can't get
her guy to talk,

22:41.160 --> 22:42.361
so now she's calling
to see what we have.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.696
Right, so answer the phone.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.797
But not right away.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.198
And act cool.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.233
Be... be casual.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.300
What's going on here?

22:48.300 --> 22:49.835
(phone beeps)

22:49.835 --> 22:51.303
Hello, Palmer.
What's shaking, baby?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.438
That is way too casual.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.772
PALMER:
What isn't shaking?

22:53.772 --> 22:55.274
Just taking a break from
interrogating Kryev.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.843
Aw, taking a break.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.511
What a bummer.
So he's not giving you anything.

22:59.511 --> 23:00.880
(chuckles) I wish.
No, I got to take a break

23:00.880 --> 23:02.181
'cause my wrist hurts so bad

23:02.181 --> 23:03.315
from writing as fast
as he's talking.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.717
All right, well, hey, you know,

23:04.717 --> 23:06.151
we're doing the same thing
over here.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.253
We're just, uh, you know,

23:07.253 --> 23:08.420
we're pulling clues

23:08.420 --> 23:09.555
out of this corpse
left and right.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.156
I mean, we got
fibers and...

23:11.156 --> 23:12.524
and DNA and stuff.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.193
Oh, you guys are still
with the corpse, huh?

23:14.193 --> 23:15.394
Why?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.696
Wait, was he tortured?

23:17.696 --> 23:19.365
You're giving away the farm.
Change the subject.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.432
(whispers):
Shut up.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.368
Uh, hey,
so it‐it‐it seems ballsy

23:22.368 --> 23:24.169
(chuckles)
to, uh, to walk out of

23:24.169 --> 23:25.337
an interrogation room when
you got your guy talking.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.672
I'm sorry.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.540
Are you saying
that I'm not ballsy

23:28.540 --> 23:30.209
or he's not talking?
'Cause how else would I know

23:30.209 --> 23:33.279
Kryev was working for Russian
mobster, Christian Orloff?

23:33.279 --> 23:34.780
It doesn't take a genius

23:34.780 --> 23:36.148
to figure out

23:36.148 --> 23:38.550
why Orloff's in town.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.185
It's textbook, Palmer.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.421
He killed two doctors
and tortured one.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.556
After they break into
the clinic, the records room,

23:44.556 --> 23:45.891
so, obviously,
he's looking for someone.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.459
Obviously.
(Avery mouths)

23:47.459 --> 23:48.827
A nurse.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.296
PALMER: A patient.
Patient. Patient.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.764
(whispering):
A patient

23:51.764 --> 23:52.898
who had plastic surgery,

23:52.898 --> 23:54.233
changed their identity.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.334
We need patient files.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.870
Right, so...
I'm just gonna subpoena

23:57.870 --> 24:00.172
patient files tomorrow.
Court's closed.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.440
She's typing.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.708
AVERY: She's not
waiting till tomorrow.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.743
So just gonna call it
a night here.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.478
Yeah, you know,
that's really a good idea.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.180
You should take some time off.
Go get some rest.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.682
Hey, Riggs, you sound like
you're out of breath.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.216
Are you running somewhere?
Uh, I'm‐I'm...

24:11.216 --> 24:12.785
Are you running to Bailey?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.453
I'm losing you, losing you,
losing you. Bye‐bye.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.722

24:16.722 --> 24:17.790

Hmm.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.824
Last six months.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.392

24:20.392 --> 24:22.294
Okay, guy's on the run
from the mob.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.562
Probably doesn't
want a paper trail.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.631
Yeah, patients
who paid in cash.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.199
Come on, Bailey, you got
this. Come on, Bailey.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.834

we could get to him.

to a blonde with a new face

25:20.219 --> 25:22.154
somewhere in L. A.?

25:24.189 --> 25:25.791
(gun cocks)
Find the girl

25:25.791 --> 25:28.127
or I start shooting.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.262
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
(Riggs sighs)

25:30.262 --> 25:31.897
Oh, don't say "can't."

25:31.897 --> 25:34.166
Why do you keep saying "can't"?
He keeps saying the same thing.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.201
But we're the good guys.
Patient information...

25:36.201 --> 25:37.169
PALMER:
Is protected

25:37.169 --> 25:38.604
by privacy laws.

25:38.604 --> 25:40.873
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,
there's a line

25:40.873 --> 25:42.908
and it starts outside.
Sir, stand firm. You do not
have to give information

25:42.908 --> 25:46.412
to LAPD.
Nor do you have to give
information to the DEA.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.746
Unless he wants to

25:47.746 --> 25:49.415
because I am not here
to bully the man.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.916
Oh, no, no, no, honey,
this is charm.

25:50.916 --> 25:51.817
(groans)
Southern charm.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.552
PALMER: That what that is?
More foreplay.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.187
Where's your back pain products?

25:55.187 --> 25:57.523
Aisle one.
RIGGS: I thought you
were taking time off.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.224
PALMER: Why do I have
to check in with you?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.159
RIGGS:
Check in with me?

26:00.159 --> 26:01.293
(door bells jingle)

26:01.293 --> 26:03.529
PALMER:
Maybe I was being...

26:05.397 --> 26:06.432
Sara.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.167
Sara Burns.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.770
Remember me?
We‐we met at the clinic.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.305
No.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.641
I... I have a familiar face.

26:15.641 --> 26:16.842
Oh.

26:16.842 --> 26:17.776
Hey, guys, look.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.245
It's Sara Burns

26:20.245 --> 26:21.413
with the familiar face.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.517
Well, hi, Sara.

26:25.517 --> 26:29.154
I'm just... (sighs) a CPA.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.123
I thought that I'd
landed a dream job

26:31.123 --> 26:33.358
at Orloff.
Or with a Russian
drug syndicate.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.893
No, I had no idea that...

26:34.893 --> 26:37.196
(sighs deeply)

26:37.196 --> 26:38.430
Okay.
(sniffs)

26:38.430 --> 26:41.366
It was six months
before I found

26:41.366 --> 26:43.669
manifests for undocumented
product out of China.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.504
You helped them ship in
boatloads

26:45.504 --> 26:47.206
of highly addictive poison

26:47.206 --> 26:49.208
into this country.
Well done.

26:49.208 --> 26:53.145
Let's try maybe a little less
aggressive approach.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.780
SARA:
I tried to quit.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.282
And then Orloff himself
came to see me.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.884
He said if I quit,

26:58.884 --> 26:59.918
I'd be killed.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.753
I knew too much.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.755
I did the only thing
that I could.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.157
Yeah?

27:05.157 --> 27:06.492
You stole his money
and bought some boobs.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.628
All right, let's take five.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.232
This little blonde thief
is wasting my time.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.168
Okay, A, that's discrimination
towards blondes.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.703
And B, look at her.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.138
She's terrified.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.639
PALMER: That's not my problem.
My problem

27:20.639 --> 27:23.876
is Christian Orloff. This is
as close as I'm gonna get.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.277
I need to nail him now.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.879
(softly):
Oh.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.381
This is about getting
you out of exile.
Don't...

27:29.381 --> 27:31.350
You're not mad at her,
you're mad at me

27:31.350 --> 27:32.518
because I messed up
your career.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.887
No, this has nothing
to do with you.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.255
And I'm sorry.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.858
Look, I knew
what was gonna happen

27:39.858 --> 27:40.893
when I gave you that file.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.161
I'm a grown‐up.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.696
It was my choice.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.532
I screwed up pretty bad,
didn't I?

27:47.633 --> 27:49.902
Yeah, you did.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.137
(door opens)

27:52.137 --> 27:54.573
Um, I was wondering, uh...

27:54.573 --> 27:55.507
what now?

27:55.507 --> 27:58.677
Um... we're all done here.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.846
We'll put you up and we'll
pick this up again tomorrow.

28:00.846 --> 28:04.616
Wait, wait,
I'm... I'm not under arrest?

28:04.616 --> 28:07.152
For ripping off
a drug trafficker?

28:07.152 --> 28:10.122
For... killing Dr. Harris.

28:11.256 --> 28:12.724
Isn't that why I'm here?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.738
When Dr. Harris found out
that Sara was hiding

28:23.738 --> 28:26.274
from the Russians,
he started to extort her.

28:26.274 --> 28:28.409
Threatened to expose her.

28:28.409 --> 28:31.446
So, she put a stop to it
with a syringe.

28:32.714 --> 28:33.848
Murder solved.

28:33.848 --> 28:34.882
It's all right here.

28:34.882 --> 28:36.918
Technically, I guess,

28:36.918 --> 28:38.920
I, uh, brought her in.

28:38.920 --> 28:39.921
Great.

28:39.921 --> 28:41.689
Thanks.

28:44.459 --> 28:45.793
That's it?

28:45.793 --> 28:48.730
No "Good job.

28:48.730 --> 28:49.530
Have a scone."

28:49.530 --> 28:52.967
Detective,
is there a problem here?

28:52.967 --> 28:55.603
Yes, Gina, there is.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.605
Let's talk about the real
elephant in this room.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.376
It is apparent that
ever since you arrived,

29:01.376 --> 29:03.578
you have had it
in for me,

29:03.578 --> 29:04.779
simply because I rejected
your advance.

29:04.779 --> 29:07.749
Excuse me?

29:07.749 --> 29:08.850
My advance?

29:08.850 --> 29:10.785
Hmm. Come on.

29:10.785 --> 29:12.387
You don't remember
we were partners?

29:12.387 --> 29:13.921
For, like, a day.

29:13.921 --> 29:15.823
No, two days.

29:15.823 --> 29:16.457
One night.

29:16.457 --> 29:18.926
Let me refresh
your memory.

29:18.926 --> 29:22.363
Stakeout.
MacArthur Park, 2003.

29:22.363 --> 29:23.698
It is raining outside.

29:23.698 --> 29:25.466
Is this gonna take much longer?

29:25.466 --> 29:27.335
On the radio,

29:27.335 --> 29:29.937
Earth, Wind & Fire's
"September" plays.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.873
But not quite
loud enough.

29:31.873 --> 29:33.841
So we both reach for the volume.

29:33.841 --> 29:35.643
My hand gets there first.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.012
Yours... doesn't retreat.

29:38.012 --> 29:42.650
No, your finger
lingers on mine.

29:42.650 --> 29:45.920
And we both know
that my rejection

29:45.920 --> 29:47.655
of said finger‐linger

29:47.655 --> 29:49.791
has grown into the elephant

29:49.791 --> 29:51.826
that exists today.

29:54.829 --> 29:56.931
Right?

29:56.931 --> 29:57.865
I mean, we‐we

29:57.865 --> 29:59.267
do both know that.

29:59.267 --> 30:00.268
Roger.

30:00.268 --> 30:02.270
Some professional advice?

30:02.270 --> 30:04.439
Always stop talking

30:04.439 --> 30:06.941
two minutes before you think

30:06.941 --> 30:09.477
you should stop talking.

30:09.477 --> 30:11.479
(quietly):
Okay.

30:13.548 --> 30:15.283
You know, I'm‐a go
write that down.
Mm.

30:15.283 --> 30:18.753
And‐and, like,
stick it on a... desk.

30:30.965 --> 30:33.367
Packing or unpacking?

30:33.367 --> 30:34.936
A little of both.

30:38.539 --> 30:39.841
Can I show you something?

30:39.841 --> 30:42.910
(sighs)

30:42.910 --> 30:43.711
Me.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.980
(laughs)
Senior year in high school.

30:45.980 --> 30:48.683
(chuckles)
And that girl loved
everything about her life.

30:48.683 --> 30:49.984
Her hair,

30:49.984 --> 30:53.020
her glasses,
her friends, her home.

30:53.020 --> 30:56.057
I thought life couldn't
get any better than that.

30:56.057 --> 30:58.659
I hope you didn't show up
to college in that sweater.

30:58.659 --> 31:01.662
I almost didn't
show up at all.

31:01.662 --> 31:04.532
No, my dad drove me down,

31:04.532 --> 31:06.968
and I refused to
get out of the car.

31:06.968 --> 31:10.872
Because I knew the best parts of
my life would be over if I did.

31:10.872 --> 31:13.341
So how'd he get you out?

31:13.341 --> 31:15.843
Well, two hours later...
(chuckles softly)

31:15.843 --> 31:19.614
he told me I only had to
go to college for one week.

31:19.614 --> 31:23.351
At the end of that week...

31:23.351 --> 31:24.986
I could call him,

31:24.986 --> 31:26.554
and he would come pick me up.

31:26.554 --> 31:28.956
So you‐you didn't call?

31:28.956 --> 31:30.591
Hell no, I didn't call.
(laughs)

31:30.591 --> 31:31.893
I didn't call for

31:31.893 --> 31:32.894
a month.
What?

31:32.894 --> 31:34.729
Yes. They actually had to send

31:34.729 --> 31:37.665
campus police to my dorm
to make sure I was okay.

31:37.665 --> 31:39.967
What?
Mm‐hmm.
(laughs)

31:39.967 --> 31:42.870
You have no idea
what's coming next.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.906
But trust me,

31:44.906 --> 31:48.576
it is gonna be amazing.

31:51.812 --> 31:53.347
(siren chirps)

31:53.347 --> 31:54.582
MURTAUGH:
Hey, what's up?

31:54.582 --> 31:55.783
Taking Sara in for booking?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.418
I thought the
unis did that.

31:57.418 --> 31:59.820
Well, Palmer finally bought into
the task force

31:59.820 --> 32:01.589
aspect of our little
group here, but, uh,

32:01.589 --> 32:02.857
she wants to see it
all the way through,

32:02.857 --> 32:03.958
so she wants
to take her in.

32:03.958 --> 32:05.259
PALMER:
Partially true.

32:05.259 --> 32:06.394
Full disclosure,

32:06.394 --> 32:07.461
I may have an ulterior motive.

32:07.461 --> 32:08.930
You don't want to book Sara?

32:08.930 --> 32:10.498
Well, look, if we book her,

32:10.498 --> 32:11.866
then Orloff's gonna find out
about it,

32:11.866 --> 32:13.534
and he's just gonna
take off for some country

32:13.534 --> 32:14.869
that won't extradite him,
and that's it.

32:14.869 --> 32:16.938
Do you have a better idea?
I do.

32:16.938 --> 32:18.906
It's called, "Get Sara to help
us implicate a drug trafficker."

32:18.906 --> 32:23.010
Wow, you have an idea, like,
with a shorter title or...?

32:23.010 --> 32:25.346
Sara doesn't have
anything on Orloff.
She doesn't,

32:25.346 --> 32:27.949
so she will have to
get something.
Come on, if we send her in there

32:27.949 --> 32:29.850
with a wire,
Orloff's gonna kill her.
You boys are forgetting

32:29.850 --> 32:32.353
the very best part
of this whole thing.

32:32.353 --> 32:33.788
She just had
plastic surgery.

32:34.855 --> 32:36.457
He doesn't know
what she looks like.

32:36.457 --> 32:38.859
So we do not send
Sara to Orloff,

32:38.859 --> 32:40.928
we send me in her place.

32:46.901 --> 32:49.770
(seabirds squawking)

32:49.770 --> 32:50.871
PALMER (over radio):
I'm just saying,

32:50.871 --> 32:52.306
if she changed her appearance,

32:52.306 --> 32:53.474
it would make sense

32:53.474 --> 32:54.709
that she changed
her wardrobe, too.

32:54.709 --> 32:56.844
RIGGS:
And I'm just saying,

32:56.844 --> 32:58.913
she didn't necessarily change it
to look like a DEA agent.

32:58.913 --> 33:02.249
Ha‐ha, so this is about
my white dress?

33:02.249 --> 33:03.351
MURTAUGH:
Hey, what the hell are you guys

33:03.351 --> 33:04.619
fishing for, Moby Dick?

33:04.619 --> 33:06.253
Todd likes to be prepared.

33:06.253 --> 33:07.588
RIGGS:
I'm just saying,

33:07.588 --> 33:09.323
you know, there's still time
to change places.

33:09.323 --> 33:12.259
Orloff doesn't know if you went
full dude with the surgery.

33:12.259 --> 33:13.794
Riggs, are you worried about me

33:13.794 --> 33:16.397
or are you just jealous
I'm having all the fun?

33:25.339 --> 33:28.809
Sara Burns. It's a pleasure
to see you again.

33:28.809 --> 33:29.844
Wow.

33:29.844 --> 33:31.512
Your doctor does good work.

33:31.512 --> 33:32.647
(laughs softly)

33:32.647 --> 33:34.348
Permission to come aboard?

33:34.348 --> 33:36.417
Yes. Please.

33:39.353 --> 33:41.922
I got Orloff and two bodyguards.

33:41.922 --> 33:43.958
MURTAUGH:
There's three more up top.

33:43.958 --> 33:45.693
Listen,

33:45.693 --> 33:47.028
you stay where I can see you.

33:47.028 --> 33:48.729
Get him to cop
to the trafficking,

33:48.729 --> 33:50.297
and get off that boat.

33:50.297 --> 33:54.969
Even in the textile business,
one must be cautious.

33:54.969 --> 33:57.004
Trusted employees
occasionally steal from you.

33:57.004 --> 33:58.739
They steal money,

33:58.739 --> 34:01.709
shipping manifests.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.444
Well, if you'd been
more cautious

34:03.444 --> 34:04.845
with your
shipping manifest,

34:04.845 --> 34:06.580
I'd still think you were
in the textile industry,

34:06.580 --> 34:08.849
and we wouldn't be here.

34:08.849 --> 34:11.285
She's either baiting him, or
gonna get punched in the face.

34:11.285 --> 34:13.954
That's why you two are
perfect for each other.

34:13.954 --> 34:16.757
You are missed
on the third floor, Sara.

34:16.757 --> 34:17.992
Eric says
he's been swamped

34:17.992 --> 34:19.427
the last two months.

34:19.427 --> 34:21.462
He's testing her.
This is a test.

34:21.462 --> 34:22.730
SARA:
There is no Eric.

34:22.730 --> 34:23.998
Eric?

34:23.998 --> 34:26.934
No. No, there's no Eric
in accounting.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.669
Do you mean Susie or Phil?
'Cause they probably

34:28.669 --> 34:30.337
could work a little bit harder.

34:31.605 --> 34:33.307
She's good.
(chuckles)

34:33.307 --> 34:35.443
I'd believe she's me.

34:35.443 --> 34:36.944
$1 million for my copy

34:36.944 --> 34:38.813
of your shipping manifest
to stay buried.

34:38.813 --> 34:41.682
You can call it a security fee,
write it off.

34:44.418 --> 34:46.020
I wish you'd stayed here, Sara.

34:46.020 --> 34:47.421
Oh.

34:47.421 --> 34:50.024
You'd be a real asset.

34:50.024 --> 34:53.327
Your fee is inside,
along with a swimsuit for you.

34:53.327 --> 34:53.994
(laughing):
Oh.

34:53.994 --> 34:55.496
No, no, I don't swim.

34:55.496 --> 34:57.531
Hmm. It's non‐negotiable.

34:57.531 --> 35:00.334
The money you took...

35:00.334 --> 35:02.336
I wish to see
what it paid for.

35:04.905 --> 35:06.607
He's checking her
for a wire.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.376
RIGGS: Don't go inside
that boat, Palmer.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.950
Henry.

35:23.591 --> 35:25.826
All right, are we all
sufficiently uncomfortable now?

35:25.826 --> 35:28.829
How about I put
my clothes back on,

35:28.829 --> 35:30.598
and you give me my money
and you can

35:30.598 --> 35:32.500
keep dealing drugs, deal?

35:32.500 --> 35:33.934
(chuckles softly)

35:33.934 --> 35:36.937
I don't sell them,
I just move them.

35:36.937 --> 35:38.305
And no.

35:38.305 --> 35:40.674
No deal.

35:42.042 --> 35:43.344
(engine starts)

35:48.315 --> 35:49.416
He's gonna kill her.

35:51.285 --> 35:54.288
The new deal is that
Henry is going to hurt you,

35:54.288 --> 35:56.824
and keep hurting you
until you tell him exactly

35:56.824 --> 35:59.827
where to find the shipping
manifest you took from me.

36:00.961 --> 36:02.296
MURTAUGH:
Hey, the boat is leaving.

36:02.296 --> 36:03.898
AVERY:
So are we. Hang on.

36:03.898 --> 36:05.933
Good luck.

36:09.270 --> 36:10.571

36:35.262 --> 36:36.430

36:36.430 --> 36:38.666

(yells)

36:53.314 --> 36:55.883
(gunshot)

36:58.719 --> 37:00.387
What are you doing?
Keep her steady.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.889
It's called the ocean, Murtaugh.

37:03.490 --> 37:04.658
(yelling)

37:09.230 --> 37:10.431

37:24.845 --> 37:25.946
(gunshots)

37:25.946 --> 37:27.982
We're losing them, go faster!

37:27.982 --> 37:30.317
It doesn't go fa‐‐
it's for fishing!

37:36.423 --> 37:37.958
(groans)

37:42.329 --> 37:44.031
Dude, I said I had
it under control.

37:44.031 --> 37:45.933
Gave one instruction:
don't go downstairs.

37:45.933 --> 37:47.735
Well, I don't take
instruction well.

37:47.735 --> 37:49.336
(gun cocks)

37:49.336 --> 37:52.039
Drop the gun,
or I shoot her.

37:52.039 --> 37:53.374
PALMER:
Riggs.

37:53.374 --> 37:54.842
Shoot him, he's gonna
kill me anyway.

37:57.878 --> 37:58.979
Drop it.

38:01.282 --> 38:02.549
Hey, Palmer?

38:03.350 --> 38:04.885
Duck.

38:17.364 --> 38:19.300
Call him Ishmael.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.509
I was mistaken.

38:39.509 --> 38:41.778
This is not
a Detective Murtaugh problem.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.113
MURTAUGH:
Aw...

38:43.113 --> 38:45.582
Deputy Chief...
It's a Riggs

38:45.582 --> 38:46.950

38:46.950 --> 38:49.686
Oh, it feels so good to hear
someone else say that.

38:49.686 --> 38:51.254
Combined with
a leadership deficit.

38:51.254 --> 38:54.157
(clears throat) Feels so good
to hear someone say that.

39:02.098 --> 39:04.901
So you think I'll get
my office back, when?

39:06.469 --> 39:08.205
Ooh.

39:08.205 --> 39:09.606
We can share mine.

39:09.606 --> 39:11.975
