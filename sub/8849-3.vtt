WEBVTT

00:08.976 --> 00:11.412
- TO BUILD
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD,

00:11.445 --> 00:14.182
THOMAS "DOC" DURANT
ONCE SAID,

00:14.215 --> 00:17.785
"A MAN MUST FACE HIS DEMONS
AND DESTROY THEM

00:17.818 --> 00:21.122
OR BECOME UNDONE
BY THEM."

00:21.155 --> 00:24.758
THE HELL ON WHEELS OF 1868
IS NO PLACE FOR BASHFUL MEN,

00:24.792 --> 00:27.328
THE DELUDED, OR UNASSURED.

00:27.361 --> 00:31.099
NO PLACE FOR SLOPPY MEN,
DRUNK AND DISORDERLY IN THEIR

00:31.132 --> 00:35.303
HEAVENLY VESTMENTS ON
THEIR WAY TO AN EARLY GRAVE.

00:35.336 --> 00:38.839
THE RAILROAD HAS CONTAINED
THE WEST THESE LAST THREE YEARS,

00:38.872 --> 00:42.543
WITH ITS IRON HORSE AND RAILS
PINNED TO THE GROUND.

00:44.845 --> 00:49.383
AND EACH PASSING DAY
BRINGS WITH IT CIVILIZATION,

00:49.417 --> 00:52.286
IF NOT CIVILITY.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.789
AND MEN IN SUITS, WHO DO NOW
WITH THEIR PENS

00:55.823 --> 00:59.059
WHAT EARLIER, ROUGHER MEN DID
WITH THEIR GUNS.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.882
CULLEN BOHANNON,
LATE OF THE UNION PACIFIC,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.352
IS MORE GUNMAN THAN SUIT.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.261
HIS RETURN TO CHEYENNE--
THESE DAYS REFERRED TO

01:33.294 --> 01:35.263
AS THE "MAGIC CITY
OF THE PLAINS"--

01:35.296 --> 01:38.899
AFTER MONTHS LOST TO
THE PRAIRIE AND PRESUMED DEAD,

01:38.932 --> 01:41.735
WITH A MORMON WIFE
AND CHILD IN TOW,

01:41.769 --> 01:44.405
MIGHT BE JUST THE GREASE
WE NEED TO TURN

01:44.438 --> 01:46.507
THE WHEELS OF OUR
NATIONAL OBSESSION,

01:46.540 --> 01:48.876
BURIED THESE LONG
WINTER MONTHS IN SNOW

01:48.909 --> 01:52.413
AND NOW, UP TO ITS
WHEEL-WELLS IN MUD.

01:52.446 --> 01:56.450
OR MIGHT IT BE THE MATCH STRIKE
OF SELF-IMMOLATION?

01:56.484 --> 01:59.453
FOR MR. BOHANNON HAS ALWAYS
WORN HIS INTEGRITY

01:59.487 --> 02:01.422
LIKE A MILLSTONE
AROUND HIS NECK.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.423
- HOWDY.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.392
- HO.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.559
- HELP YOU?

02:05.593 --> 02:06.894
- YOU CAN STEP ASIDE.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.197
- BOHANNON'S BACK!

02:16.270 --> 02:19.440
- WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS HERE?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.309
- HA. YOU HEAR THAT, DEPUTY?

02:21.342 --> 02:24.378
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

02:24.412 --> 02:28.616
THERE'S NOTHIN' HERE FOR
MORMONS BUT TROUBLE, FRIEND.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.418
- I AIN'T
LOOKIN' FOR TROUBLE.

02:32.486 --> 02:37.291
- JUST THE KIND OF PEOPLE
TROUBLE FINDS IN MY TOWN.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.428
THERE'S A MORMON SETTLEMENT
50, 60 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.462
YOU'LL BE WELCOME THERE.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.896
- LET GO OF MY HORSE.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.784
LET GO OF MY HORSE.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.457
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.593
- I'D LISTEN TO HER.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.495
- I SUGGEST YOU
TURN AROUND AND--

03:14.528 --> 03:15.429
AHH!

03:23.404 --> 03:24.472
[grunts]

03:24.505 --> 03:26.440
- STILL BLOCKIN' MY HORSE.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.808
- AHH!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.532
- THANK YOU.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.833
[clicks tongue]
LET'S GO.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.409
- CULLEN BOHANNON
HAS COME HOME, DEAR READER.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.978
AND IN OUR LITTLE WORLD
JUST WEST OF CIVILIZATION,

04:05.012 --> 04:08.616
WE FIND OURSELVES
ONCE AGAIN AT HIS MERCY.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.652
[western folk music]

04:11.685 --> 04:16.690
*

04:41.549 --> 04:43.651
[train horn blows]

04:43.684 --> 04:45.753
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

04:45.786 --> 04:47.355
TO TUNNEL
THROUGH THAT MOUNTAIN?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.689
NO MAN CAN DO IT?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.391
- WE'VE BEEN BLASTIN'
FOR MORE THAN A WEEK.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.726
DAMN THING KEEPS
CAVING IN ON ITSELF.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.762
- GOD SAKES, DELANEY.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.598
THE SIERRA NEVADAS
COULDN'T STOP HUNTINGTON.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.468
THIS BLIP OF A MOLEHILL
IS NOT GOING TO STOP ME.

05:00.501 --> 05:04.372
- THE SIERRAS ARE
MADE OF GRANITE, MR. DURANT.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.474
WE'RE DEALING WITH MORE
UNSTABLE TERRAIN HERE.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.375
MUDROCK AND SHALE.

05:07.408 --> 05:11.044
- EXCUSES WILL NOT
GET MY TUNNEL BUILT.

05:11.078 --> 05:15.115
NOW, DO WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO DO.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.618
PUT ON AN EXTRA SHIFT
TO CLEAR THE RUBBLE

05:17.651 --> 05:20.120
AND PRINT UP MORE SCRIP
TO PAY THE MEN.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.623
THEY WON'T WORK FOR NOTHING,
NOT EVEN THE FREEDMEN.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.957
- MR. DURANT--

05:23.991 --> 05:26.560
- THAT WILL BE ALL.
THANK YOU, DELANEY.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.416
- THIS IS THE RAILROAD
OFFICE,

05:48.449 --> 05:51.685
NOT THE TICKET OFFICE.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.986
BEHIND THE BUILDING.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.456
ACROSS THE TRACKS
AT THE DEPOT.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.657
- CULLEN BOHANNON.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.659
HERE TO SEE DURANT.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.461
- [chuckles]

06:03.697 --> 06:05.533
- MARTIN DELANEY.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.835
- OH.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.537
BUILDER OF STONE
AND BROOK BRIDGES.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.539
- CHIEF ENGINEER
AT THE UNION PACIFIC.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.649
- IT'S THE GHOST
OF CULLEN BOHANNON.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.185
AND...MORMON, NO LESS.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.456
[chuckles]

06:28.489 --> 06:30.658
IF EVER THERE WAS PROOF
THAT YOU CANNOT BE KILLED,

06:30.691 --> 06:32.192
THIS IS IT.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.695
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE BEING DRAGGED AWAY

06:34.728 --> 06:38.699
BY A GANG OF MASKED OUTLAWS,
NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.867
- IT WAS HER DAD
WHO TOOK ME.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.203
MORMON MILITIA
ON ACCOUNT OF THE--

06:43.236 --> 06:46.206
THIS IS MY WIFE NAOMI
AND, UH, MY SON WILLIAM.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.476
WE WINTERED UP
AT FORT SMITH.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.511
TOOK SOME DOIN',
BUT I'M BACK NOW.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.780
- AND HOW MANY MORMONS DID
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE GROUND

06:52.813 --> 06:55.816
TO EFFECT YOUR ESCAPE?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.184
- WASN'T LIKE THAT.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.688
- IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT
WITH YOU, BOHANNON.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.155
YOU START A GUNFIGHT
IN MY TOWN,

07:02.189 --> 07:07.227
NEARLY HAVE US ALL KILLED,
AND FOR WHAT?

07:07.260 --> 07:11.231
A GIRL YOU GOT PREGNANT.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.568
- COME BACK FOR MY OLD JOB.
IS IT MINE OR NOT?

07:14.602 --> 07:15.736
- NO. NOT.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.505
- YOUR RAILROAD'S STUCK,
DURANT.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.707
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN GET IT MOVIN' AGAIN.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.842
- EVEN IF I COULD
FIRE MR. DELANEY,

07:21.875 --> 07:24.244
HE HAS DONE
NOTHING TO WARRANT IT.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.747
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
STAND THERE WALLOWING

07:26.780 --> 07:29.517
IN MORAL TURPITUDE,
HAVING JUST CONFESSED

07:29.550 --> 07:32.553
TO COMPLETE LACK OF REGARD
FOR THE MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

07:32.586 --> 07:35.723
NEEDED TO GET
THIS ROAD MOVING:

07:35.756 --> 07:37.257
DEPENDABILITY.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.527
- WHAT YOU NEED TO GET
THIS ROAD MOVIN' AGAIN

07:39.560 --> 07:41.762
IS A MAN WHO CAN GET YOU
OVER SHERMAN SUMMIT, ALL RIGHT?

07:41.795 --> 07:42.930
HE AIN'T HIM.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.898
- I AM NOT GOING OVER,
BOHANNON.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.800
I AM GOING THROUGH.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.736
AND WITHOUT YOU.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.740
WELCOME TO CHEYENNE, MADAM.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.928
- THIS AIN'T HOW I PLANNED
ON THINGS GOIN'.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.798
- THIS AIN'T
HOW I PICTURED CHEYENNE.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.934
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.637
- WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
TOGETHER.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.741
- COME ON.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.815
- MR. BOHANNON!

08:34.848 --> 08:36.216
YOU ARE A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.952
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
ME LUCK HAD RUN OUT,

08:38.986 --> 08:42.322
HERE YOU BE.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.824
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.859
- GOT A MORMON GIRL
IN THE FAMILY WAY,

08:45.893 --> 08:47.928
AND I NEED A JOB.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.263
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.600
- GRANT SENT
A CARPETBAGGER OUT

08:52.633 --> 08:54.668
TO INSTALL LAW AND ORDER.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.171
HE HUNG A MAN FROM THE RAFTERS
OF MY CASINO.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.975
I COULD USE
A MAN LIKE YOU.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.977
- MM-MM.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.717
NO, THANKS.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.355
- YOU JUST SAID
YOU NEEDED A JOB.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.257
- NOT THAT ONE.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.660
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICK.
[clicks tongue]

09:22.863 --> 09:24.898
- BY THE WAY,
I'M THE MAYOR NOW!

09:24.932 --> 09:26.967
- CONGRATULATIONS.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.337
- IS HE A CLOSE
FRIEND OF YOURS?

09:30.370 --> 09:34.041
- KILLED HIS BROTHER,
AND I HELPED TO BURY HIM.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.844
SUPPOSE THAT
MAKES US SOMETHIN'.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.012
- I PAID $28
FOR THIS RIFLE.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.048
- YOU CAN TAKE IT
OUT OF HIS HIDE.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.716
- WHEN?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.852
- WHEN I TELL YOU.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.663
- A RARE BULGARIAN, THAT ONE.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.832
STEAL THE MILK OUT YOUR TEA
AS SOON AS HE LOOK AT YA.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.768
A SURVEYOR FOR
THE UNION PACIFIC.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.902
AN EMPLOYEE OF MR. DURANT

10:01.935 --> 10:03.904
WHO HAPPENS TO BE A PARTNER

10:03.937 --> 10:06.740
IN MY CASINO.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.341
- HE STINKS.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.011
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.079
- I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.014
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE,
MCGINNES.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.749
- HE'S YOUR TRASH NOW.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.951
AND NEXT TIME YE DECIDE
TO TURN MY BUSINESS

10:17.985 --> 10:20.921
INTO A GALLOWS...

10:20.954 --> 10:23.857

10:23.891 --> 10:25.625
GENTLEMEN.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.975
- HO.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.984

10:56.757 --> 10:58.058
- THIS YOURN.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.060
I KNOWED YOU'S COMIN' BACK,
I'D HAVE GUARDED

11:00.093 --> 11:02.796
WHAT LITTLE MONEY WAS HID
BACKSIDE AND FRONT.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.998
THAT MONEY FED US GOOD
FOR A MONTH.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.900
BOUGHT US ONE HELL
OF A HANGOVER, TOO.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.903
[laughter]

11:09.937 --> 11:13.040
- IF YOU GIVE ME A JOB,
WE'LL FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.843
- YOU AIN'T BEEN IN THE SUN LONG
ENOUGH FOR THAT, MR. BOHANNON.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.278
- I GOT A FAMILY TO FEED.

11:22.449 --> 11:26.854
- FREEDMAN WORK,
FREEDMAN WAGES.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.489
- FAIR ENOUGH.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.458
- NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY
I'D BE THE BOSS OF THE BOSS.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.993
- DON'T GET USED TO IT,
PSALMS.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.494
- MM-HMM.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.830
[distant train horn blows]

11:47.007 --> 11:48.976
- RUTH.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.011
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO SEE YOU NOW.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.013
WELL.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.483
WE ALL GOT THE SHOCK

11:56.516 --> 12:01.855
W-WITH MR. BOHANNON'S
RETURN TO CHEYENNE.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.791

12:03.824 --> 12:07.027
I'VE BEEN PRAYING THESE MANY
MONTHS FOR SUCH A MIRACLE.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.464
- HOW ARE YOU, RUTH?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.003
- STILL PRAYING.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.215
- RECKON NOBODY'LL START
A WAR IF YOU STAY HERE.

YOU CAN SEE CHURCH LADY.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.059
HER NAME'S RUTH,

[gunshots]
[horse neighs]

13:18.631 --> 13:22.235
I'LL BE FINE.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.571
WE'LL BE FINE.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.148

SHE FIND OUT YOU GOT

13:57.604 --> 14:01.408
UH-OH. HERE COME

14:01.441 --> 14:04.177

14:07.314 --> 14:08.448
- EVA, CALM DOWN NOW!

14:08.481 --> 14:10.250

AS ALWAYS!

14:11.251 --> 14:13.153
- EVA, I'M SORRY.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.988
[bell ringing]

14:24.064 --> 14:26.599
[train horn]

14:40.213 --> 14:43.116
- I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW
IF MR. BOHANNON WILL RESUME

14:43.150 --> 14:45.252
HIS ROLE AS CHIEF ENGINEER
NOW THAT HE'S RETURNED.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.354
- NO, MR. DELANEY
IS CHIEF ENGINEER NOW

14:47.387 --> 14:50.157
AND WILL BE
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.225
- YOU DON'T EXPECT
ANY POLITICAL PRESSURE

14:52.259 --> 14:54.327
FROM WASHINGTON TO RESTORE
BOHANNON TO HIS POST?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.063
- NO, WHY?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.331
- HE SAVED
A YOUNG BOY'S LIFE?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.301
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY
VIEW HIM AS A HERO.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.204
WASHINGTON LOVES A HERO.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.207
- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A HERO

15:07.240 --> 15:09.076
AND A MAN WHO'S LOST
HIS WAY, MISS ELLISON--

15:09.109 --> 15:14.047
SOMETHING WASHINGTON NOR YOU
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.718
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

15:18.751 --> 15:21.221
I MIGHT MISTAKE YOUR OBSESSION
WITH BOHANNON

15:21.254 --> 15:24.157
FOR SOMETHING MORE, UH...

15:24.191 --> 15:25.325
PERSONAL.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.996
[scoffs]
HE'S NOT THAT INTERESTING.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.335
EXCUSE ME,
MISS ELLISON. I, UH--

15:45.145 --> 15:49.349
- THAT'S THE FLAG OF
THE NEW WYOMING TERRITORY.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.118
- ODD PLACE FOR IT.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.253
- ONE DAY WHEN PEOPLE ARRIVE
ON YOUR TRAIN,

15:53.286 --> 15:56.089
THEY'LL LOOK UP,
SEE THAT FLAG FLYIN'

15:56.123 --> 15:57.757
ABOVE MY STATEHOUSE

15:57.790 --> 16:00.393
AND KNOW THE VALUE WE PLACE
ON LAW AND ORDER AROUND HERE.

16:00.427 --> 16:05.132
- LAW ABIDING PEOPLE
WHO ADMIRE THE CONFISCATION

16:05.165 --> 16:08.101
OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, HMM?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.436
THAT'S RAILROAD LAND.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.671
- TECHNICALLY, IF IT'S NOT
IN USE BY THE RAILROAD

16:11.704 --> 16:14.774
FOR RAILROAD PURPOSES,
THAT LAND IS AVAILABLE

16:14.807 --> 16:18.278
FOR ACQUISITION BY THE STATE
UNDER EMINENT DOMAIN.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.413
THAT'S THE LAW, MR. DURANT.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.252
- I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED

16:25.285 --> 16:28.288
BY YOUR INTERPRETATION OF LAW,
MR. CAMPBELL.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.158
NOR BY THE HANGING SHENANIGANS
OF YOUR LAWMEN

16:31.191 --> 16:33.326
IN THE CASINO
A FEW DAYS AGO.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.128
NOW, THAT LAND'S
THE FUTURE SITE

16:35.162 --> 16:37.464
OF THE UNION PACIFIC
FOOD DEPOT.

16:37.497 --> 16:42.102
MY ENGINEERS ARE DRAWING
UP PLANS EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.375
- IF THERE IS NO STRUCTURE
ON THAT HILL WITHIN 24 HOURS,

16:48.408 --> 16:51.411
MR. DURANT,
MY OFFICE WILL FILE FORM 0939,

16:51.444 --> 16:54.547
CONDEMNING THAT PROPERTY
FOR STATE USE...

16:54.581 --> 16:57.284
AS SET FORTH BY THE
UNITED STATES RAILROAD ACT.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.519
- FAIR ENOUGH, MR. CAMPBELL.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.756
FAIR ENOUGH.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.366
- MR. CAMPBELL.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.102
- MISS ELLISON.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.304
THAT'S A LOVELY COLOR.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.471
- EXCUSE ME?

17:18.505 --> 17:21.308
- ON YOU, THAT IS.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.309
- THANK YOU.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.378
- ALLOW ME.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.280
- OH, I CAN MANAGE ON MY OWN.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.315
THANK YOU.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.423
[train horn blows]

17:41.894 --> 17:45.198

OF MY CHICKEN COOPS ON THE HILL

17:45.232 --> 17:47.234
JUST EAST OF THE CHURCH
BY TOMORROW MORNING.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.502
DIVERT WHATEVER MANPOWER
AND SUPPLIES YOU NEED.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.404

ON THE GRADE.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.505
PER YOUR ORDERS.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.873

18:20.500 --> 18:22.535
- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
ANY BUSINESS OF YOURS, EVA

18:22.569 --> 18:24.237
- HOW MUCH DOES
THE LAST THREE CARDS PAY?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.406
- CLEAN THE TABLES.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.908
YOU AIN'T THINKIN' OF
GAMBLING IN MY CASINO NOW?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.912
I'M THINKIN' I WILL, MICKEY.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.881
MY MONEY AIN'T

19:13.353 --> 19:15.922

YOU WANT TO HEAR THE STORY
OF HOW I LOST MY SCALP?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.626

I'VE BEEN HAVIN' DREAMS...

30:15.281 --> 30:17.283
ABOUT ELAM.

30:17.316 --> 30:22.288
NOT EVERY NIGHT,
BUT MOST NIGHTS.

I'M IN A BIG CITY
SOMEWHERES.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.594
I'M LOST.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.062
WALKIN' THE STREETS.

30:30.096 --> 30:33.132
LOOKIN' INTO PEOPLES' HOMES.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.234
THEIR NICE WARM WINDOWS.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.003
I'M ON THE OUTSIDE.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.171
ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.073
EVERYONE'S AFRAID OF ME.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.109
[thunder rumbles]

30:43.142 --> 30:46.278
I THINK IT'S
'CAUSE OF MY TATTOO.

30:46.312 --> 30:50.649
AND THEN I REALIZE...

30:50.682 --> 30:53.652
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.256
I SEE MY REFLECTION.

30:57.289 --> 31:00.126
I'M NOT ME ANYMORE.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.961
I'M A BEAR,

31:01.994 --> 31:05.564
AND I'M LOOKIN' FOR ELAM.

31:05.597 --> 31:09.001

31:11.203 --> 31:14.173
THEY DON'T MEAN NOTHIN'.

THERE WILL BE NO LAW.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.187
