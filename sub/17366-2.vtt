00:12.072 --> 00:15.016
Tonight, James gets wet.

00:15.064 --> 00:18.024
An actual or spin
doctor on our track.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.056
And the Stig laps a Reliant Robin.

00:28.024 --> 00:30.056
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello.

00:30.091 --> 00:32.088
Hello. Good evening. Hello.

00:32.122 --> 00:35.033
Now...

00:35.068 --> 00:41.000
Now, as we know, as we know, track
days these days are very popular.

00:41.035 --> 00:45.032
The idea is that you drive
your own car to a race circuit,

00:45.067 --> 00:47.096
wearing some horrible
branded shirt...

00:47.131 --> 00:49.041
LAUGHTER

00:49.076 --> 00:51.017
Like, for example, this one.

00:51.052 --> 00:57.036
And then you drive around as fast as
possible all day and then you go home.

00:57.071 --> 00:58.997
Today, track days are
such big business

00:59.032 --> 01:04.012
you can even buy specialised track
day cars like this KTM Crossbow.

01:04.047 --> 01:08.057
Thing is, this costs
L45,000, which is a lot,

01:08.092 --> 01:11.989
especially as you can't exactly
take the kids to school in it.

01:12.024 --> 01:18.018
No, so, to address this, the producers gave
us each a budget of L5,000, and they told
us to buy

01:18.053 --> 01:24.012
four-door saloons that could be used every
day but that would also be good on a track
day.

01:24.047 --> 01:28.053
And because the challenges they
had in mind were quite serious,

01:28.088 --> 01:32.060
they told us to meet up in the
world's the least amusing city.

01:39.036 --> 01:41.076
Yup, it was Berlin.

01:46.048 --> 01:49.068
I was the first to arrive
and as you would imagine,

01:49.103 --> 01:51.579
I had done everything properly.

01:51.614 --> 01:54.021
This is a Mercedes 190 Cosworth

01:54.056 --> 01:58.061
and Martin Brundle, the
former Formula One driver,

01:58.096 --> 02:03.068
said that this car had one of the best
chassis ever fitted to a four-door saloon.

02:03.103 --> 02:07.088
It is, if you like, the
thinking man's BMW M3.

02:07.123 --> 02:09.044
Talking of which...

02:13.008 --> 02:16.028
Hammond. Oh, yeah. Take a look.

02:16.063 --> 02:18.049
Yes. BMW M3, 3.2 litres.

02:18.084 --> 02:20.973
So you've bought the wrong one.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.048
No, I haven't, because the original
one is now considered a classic.

02:24.083 --> 02:27.029
So you can't get a good
one for less than 15,000.

02:27.064 --> 02:32.008
This, the series two of the M3,
is bigger, faster and better.

02:33.008 --> 02:36.025
So this is the famous
Mercedes 190. It is. 2.3.

02:36.060 --> 02:41.048
Cosworth. Known for being the
slowest performance car of all time.

02:41.083 --> 02:46.036
At that moment we were interrupted
by the arrival of Clarkson.

02:46.071 --> 02:48.060
Predictable, predictable...

02:48.095 --> 02:50.005
For good reason.

02:50.040 --> 02:57.025
The only reason you two didn't buy a Ford
Sierra Sapphire Cosworth is cos you forgot
about it.

02:57.060 --> 03:03.016
No. It's because when you think of
high-performance four-door saloons you
naturally think of Germany.

03:03.051 --> 03:05.000
It's what they do here. Exactly.

03:05.035 --> 03:06.033
And where was yours made?

03:06.068 --> 03:11.012
Well, it was designed by a man
called Uwe Bahnsen, who is German.

03:11.047 --> 03:13.025
And where was it built? Belgium.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.076
Ah, Belgium, the meccafor the
performance motorist. Yeah.

03:16.111 --> 03:19.057
Belgium is home to everything.
Tennis players, chips...

03:19.092 --> 03:23.068
It's not the first place you think of
going for a performance saloon car!

03:23.103 --> 03:26.060
You two are going to lose his and
you will end up in ze cooler...

03:26.095 --> 03:28.096
'At that moment, a
challenge arrived. '

03:28.131 --> 03:31.001
Oh, hello. Thank you.

03:31.036 --> 03:35.021
"You will now leave Berlin, and head
down an unrestricted autobahn. " Good.

03:35.056 --> 03:43.028
"Points will be awarded for every mph more
than 130 that you can or, should we say,
dare achieve. "

03:43.063 --> 03:46.056
Still won't be out of second
gear when they're going down...

03:46.091 --> 03:49.000
What's the top speed?
Top speed of that? Yeah.

03:49.035 --> 03:51.009
151.

03:51.044 --> 03:53.029
Mine had to be LIMITED to 155.

03:53.064 --> 03:55.017
This is when they
introduced limiting.

03:55.052 --> 03:57.045
They realised it's too fast.
It's a monster.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.036
Fair enough, becausethis had the six
cylinder engine,3.2 litre. It did.

04:01.071 --> 04:05.040
James, I seem to remember
this was not that fast. No.

04:05.075 --> 04:07.581
What was its top speed? 143. 143?!

04:07.616 --> 04:10.053
So not really a performance car.

04:10.088 --> 04:14.024
But I reckon mine will still do
that because it is a Mercedes...

04:14.059 --> 04:16.985
What? Oh, my God!

04:17.019 --> 04:18.012
Ah, the interior, yeah.

04:18.048 --> 04:22.096
Have you seen the inside of his car?
Toffee and caramel, that interior is.

04:22.130 --> 04:26.029
It's not! Oh, and he's gone
for the fake wood door-pull.

04:26.064 --> 04:31.016
That's a quality touch.
Right,we've got to get out of Berlin. OK.

04:31.051 --> 04:32.045
What's that?

04:32.080 --> 04:34.993
I don't know.
Wasn't there this morning.

04:35.028 --> 04:38.012
You don't think it fell out
of James' luggage, do you?

04:38.047 --> 04:42.004
HE LAUGHS Fell out of my what?
I missed that.

04:49.032 --> 04:51.052
Ooh, yes. Straight six.

04:51.087 --> 04:53.072
That's a proper engine.

04:55.064 --> 04:57.004
This is the Wall.

04:58.056 --> 05:05.060
What this car has, that the other two cars
don't have, is a dog-leg first gear. I
should explain this.

05:05.095 --> 05:09.016
Normally, first gear is
away from you and forwards

05:09.051 --> 05:12.969
but here it is away
from you and backwards.

05:13.004 --> 05:17.032
That means that second and third and then
fourth and fifth are in straight lines,

05:17.067 --> 05:19.001
which is what you want for racing,

05:19.036 --> 05:23.072
so that is a sign that this car
has a proper motor sport pedigree.

05:25.060 --> 05:28.013
You have to remember that in
the late '80s, early '90s,

05:28.048 --> 05:33.048
the Germans were all drunk, running around
celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.981
And that showed in the sloppiness
of the cars they were making.

05:37.016 --> 05:42.052
The Belgians, on the other hand, they
never have anything to celebrate.

05:42.087 --> 05:47.088
They just get up, go to work and
do a good job, as we can see here.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.096
Those are his reversing lights.

05:56.096 --> 05:58.973
Oh, BLEEP!

05:59.008 --> 06:00.036
James, what was that?

06:00.071 --> 06:02.013
Er, nothing.

06:02.048 --> 06:06.024
Look, I've had 30 years of
it being left and forward.

06:06.059 --> 06:08.016
It's a difficult
habit to get out of.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.084
HE CHUCKLES

06:13.004 --> 06:17.020
On the outskirts of Berlin, we pulled
over so our cars could be fitted

06:17.055 --> 06:19.001
with super-accurate speedometers.

06:19.036 --> 06:24.096
And then we hit the autobahn, to
see which one was the fastest.

06:27.008 --> 06:29.060
Right, for Belgium!

06:31.012 --> 06:34.052
Two-litre. 16 valve. Massive turbo.

06:35.068 --> 06:37.973
5,000rpm.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.080
5,500. Into fifth.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.029
120.

06:43.064 --> 06:45.052
Come on, come on!

06:45.087 --> 06:47.069
125.

06:47.104 --> 06:49.017
6, 7...

06:49.052 --> 06:51.036
Ooh, it's pulling to the right.

06:51.071 --> 06:53.565
Gone floaty.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.025
128... 9.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.016
Come on, let's have 130!

06:59.051 --> 07:00.053
Traffic.

07:00.088 --> 07:02.080
Lot of trucks. A lot of trucks.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.096
117.

07:08.096 --> 07:10.044
121.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.044
Feeling good.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.068
128...

07:18.103 --> 07:20.068
132.

07:22.024 --> 07:25.044
135. Traffic.

07:25.079 --> 07:26.080
Oh, God!

07:32.016 --> 07:34.060
Clocked now at 114.

07:34.095 --> 07:36.028
Concentrate.

07:39.016 --> 07:42.004
122. A bit of a weave.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.064
Oh, bloody lorry.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.061
Achtung! Schnell! Schnell!

07:49.096 --> 07:53.092
It turned out that while you're allowed
to reach the top speed of your car

07:53.127 --> 07:57.001
on the autobahn, it's not easy.

07:57.036 --> 08:01.017
You get these German trucks...
Yes, look, he's doing it. He's doing it.

08:01.052 --> 08:06.024
You just get these East German trucks and
they just pull out when they want to pull
out.

08:06.059 --> 08:10.000
Eventually, though,
the traffic did thin.

08:10.035 --> 08:13.000
So we went for another run.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.004
Here we go, again!

08:16.052 --> 08:17.558
Don't pull out.

08:17.593 --> 08:19.064
Do not pull out.

08:22.048 --> 08:25.050
132...

08:25.085 --> 08:27.582
3, 4, 5...

08:27.617 --> 08:30.080
Go! Come on!

08:32.028 --> 08:33.044
136.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.063
Smelling pretty bad.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.049
138... 9...

08:42.083 --> 08:45.052
140 miles an hour!

08:48.016 --> 08:50.041
Oh, yes!

08:50.076 --> 08:52.068
Engine temperature's shooting up.

08:52.103 --> 08:56.997
Well, that was 142mph.

08:57.032 --> 09:01.052
'Not bad for a 21 year-old Ford. '

09:02.064 --> 09:04.036
Woo!

09:05.012 --> 09:07.060
135, yes!

09:09.056 --> 09:12.092
Give me 140! Give me 140!

09:12.127 --> 09:14.025
There it is.

09:14.060 --> 09:19.048
'Just three more miles per hour and the
German Cosworth would beat the Belgian
Cosworth. '

09:22.008 --> 09:23.032
Come on, come, come on.

09:26.084 --> 09:29.096
It's not going to do it. Sorry.

09:29.131 --> 09:31.060
I did my best.

09:33.036 --> 09:35.036
'Now, watch and learn. '

09:36.060 --> 09:39.004
Come on now, come
on now, come on now.

50...

09:54.080 --> 09:56.064
152!

10:00.032 --> 10:02.037
Traffic. Slowing.

10:02.072 --> 10:07.076
This thing will do 155 pretty easily
I've just hit traffic every time.

10:07.111 --> 10:10.056
Yeah, yeah... This will do 180.

10:11.056 --> 10:13.072
It will!

Saying the BMW's the most spacious

13:19.115 --> 13:22.559

and we must emulate his lifestyle, and
indeed the lifestyle of his lovely wife,
Coleen.

13:54.119 --> 13:59.024
Now of course, we realise he is a
lazy, talentless jug-eared oaf.

13:59.059 --> 14:00.969
AUDIENCE CHEERS

14:01.004 --> 14:03.036
APPLAUSE Well, he is.

14:04.036 --> 14:06.045
That's quite strong.
Strong but true.

14:06.080 --> 14:12.088
I'm now hoping this means an end
to the Rooney-fication of Britain.

14:12.123 --> 14:16.056
Exhibit A, the Range Rover, OK?
This was the old model.

14:16.091 --> 14:18.989
Note the plain, sensible front end,

14:19.024 --> 14:22.064
just some headlights to see where
you're going. Its noble. It's noble.

14:22.099 --> 14:23.589
As dignified as a rolled umbrella.

14:23.624 --> 14:25.045
Now look what they've done to it.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.080
Look at this. Honest.
This is the new one. What is it?

14:28.115 --> 14:30.973
How much bling can you
get on the front...?

14:31.008 --> 14:34.080
Look at all the fiddly headlamps
and all this business going on!

14:34.115 --> 14:38.036
I'm surprised it doesn't
have studs in its ears, here.

14:38.071 --> 14:41.017
They have literally ruined it.

14:41.052 --> 14:45.046
Now, listen, I am aware, of course,
that there is a demand for a car

14:45.081 --> 14:49.040
that looks like this, because I know
there's such a place as Cheshire.

14:49.075 --> 14:54.064
And I don't mind if they make this...
Range Rover Rooney edition.

14:54.099 --> 14:57.032
They could just call
it the Range Rooney.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.029
No, no - the Wayne Wover.

15:00.064 --> 15:03.544
LAUGHTER These are good names.
These are good names.

15:03.579 --> 15:06.989
But all I'm asking is
please can everybody else,

15:07.024 --> 15:11.004
ordinary decent people, have
the old one back, please?

15:11.039 --> 15:12.033
I have to say I agree with you.

15:12.068 --> 15:14.985
There needs to be a version
of the new Range Rover

15:15.020 --> 15:22.016
that isn't for people who want to celebrate
the life and work of a potato-faced
shopping enthusiast.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.021
We want the old one back.
We really do. We do.

15:24.056 --> 15:28.985
Now, there aren't very many things
that we all agree on, except this.

15:29.020 --> 15:34.000
We all think that the best small car that
you can buy at the moment is the Citroen
DS3.

15:34.035 --> 15:35.017
Now, we're not joking about this.

15:35.052 --> 15:39.008
That is a genuinely brilliant littlecar.
There's something about it.

15:39.043 --> 15:42.525
It's like a Mini that smokes Gauloises.
It is. It's fantastic.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.804
The weird thing is, it's got exactly
the same engine as the Mini,

15:45.839 --> 15:49.048
the Mini Cooper. But it just feels better.
It does. It's great.

15:49.083 --> 15:52.061
They're bringing out a
new hot version of this.

15:52.096 --> 15:56.025
I've got the picture of it here.
It's called the Racing. OK? Yeah!

15:56.060 --> 16:01.052
200 horsepower. The only think is Citroen
will not... They refuse to tell us how much
it's going to cost.

16:01.087 --> 16:04.084
I'm just going to make it up.
50 quid. There you go.

16:04.119 --> 16:06.033
It's L50. That's fantastic.

16:06.068 --> 16:10.036
And the thing is, who in their
life wouldn't want orange wheels?

16:10.071 --> 16:14.008
Seriously. Anyone with red hair,
I imagine. It would clash.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.557
Red squirrels.
They'd look terrible.

16:16.592 --> 16:19.037
The Duchess of York.
Anne Robinson. Yes.

16:19.072 --> 16:22.092
The Pope. What's he called,th
e Pope bloke? Well, the Pope.

16:22.127 --> 16:24.045
Silence, you two.

16:24.080 --> 16:29.044
They're are only making 1,000 of them,
because they're French and therefore idle
Communists.

16:29.079 --> 16:33.017
It's because nobody wants
orange wheels, obviously!

16:33.052 --> 16:37.020
I can't wait to get a go in that. It looks
brilliant. And I do like the wheels.

16:37.055 --> 16:40.977
Hey! Good news. LAUGHTER

16:41.012 --> 16:48.056
I have secured some top-secret film taken
inside the factory of the new Dacia Duster
being made.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.045
Ooh! Excellent.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.062
Excellent. Anyway...

16:52.097 --> 16:54.009
LAUGHTER The end of...

16:54.044 --> 16:55.977
I'm sure you have. Thank you.

16:56.012 --> 17:00.016
At the end of last week's programme, this
appeared. This is called the end board.

17:00.051 --> 17:01.559
This is what you see
every single week

17:01.594 --> 17:03.068
at the end of every
single programme.

17:03.103 --> 17:05.096
Except for Top Gear. Look -

17:05.131 --> 17:07.032
MMXX.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.001
That's 2020.

17:09.036 --> 17:14.028
This is the only programme coming
from ten years in the future.

17:14.063 --> 17:16.984
Anyway, the point is, OK,
there's a new car come out.

17:17.020 --> 17:21.008
It's called the Night XV.
I've got a picture of it here. OK, now...

17:21.042 --> 17:24.040
XV. What's that?

17:24.076 --> 17:26.032
That's 207, in Roman numerals.

17:26.068 --> 17:28.049
No... 93. Yeah,
something like that.

17:28.084 --> 17:32.008
No, it's 207, definitely.
Let me talk you through it, OK?

17:32.043 --> 17:34.028
L650,000.

17:36.032 --> 17:43.060
For that you get internet connectivity,
you get DVD, TV, a cigar humidor...

17:43.095 --> 17:48.056
And according to one report, it
can resist gunfire for 24 hours.

17:48.091 --> 17:50.013
LAUGHTER

17:50.048 --> 17:55.076
Do you know what? I think if I was shooting
at someone, I'd get sort of bored after
about four hours.

17:55.111 --> 18:00.052
I think the police would havearrived by
four hours, personally. But, forgive me, it
is a car.

18:00.087 --> 18:02.005
You'd kind of drive
off before then.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.020
After an hour, you'd think, "They're
not changing their minds. I'm going. "

18:06.055 --> 18:07.021
He is still shooting at me.

18:07.056 --> 18:10.076
And the other thing, as well,
is it's made in Canada.

18:10.111 --> 18:13.080
Who in Canada could do...
? Are you Canadian?

18:13.115 --> 18:15.041
Yeah! Yeah!

18:15.076 --> 18:18.040
Whatever happens in Canada
that would cause somebody

18:18.075 --> 18:21.033
to shoot at somebody
else for 24 hours?

18:21.068 --> 18:25.080
The other thing as well is if you are
shooting at it, it's not likely you're
going to miss,

18:25.115 --> 18:28.009
because here's a picture
of it next to a Hummer.

18:28.044 --> 18:31.056
Look at the size of it! It is massive.
Absolutely unbelievable.

18:31.091 --> 18:35.083
So that's Canada's answer
to the motor industry there.

18:35.118 --> 18:39.076
Now, I don't know if any of
you were watching last week,

18:39.111 --> 18:43.040
but I had several accidents
in a Reliant Robin.

18:43.075 --> 18:45.985
Which has generated
a sizable postbag.

18:46.020 --> 18:50.000
I've got some of the letters here. Lots of
them. Let me just read you this one, OK?

18:50.035 --> 18:55.004
It says, "Dear Top Gear, the only reason
why Mr So-called Clarkson was killed

18:55.039 --> 18:58.031
"is because he wasn't
driving it properly.

18:58.066 --> 19:01.024
"I bet if the Stig drove
it, he'd be fine. "

19:01.059 --> 19:04.060
Tell you what, let's find out.

19:06.008 --> 19:08.096
I'm betting he rolls that over.
No, this is the Stig.

19:08.131 --> 19:11.029
The only thing that's
ever defeated him was...

19:11.064 --> 19:16.044
He will not be able to do a lap in that
car without rolling over. I guarantee it.

19:16.079 --> 19:18.013
He'll use his special
Stiggy powers.

19:18.048 --> 19:21.056
Coming up to the first corner now.
Perfect. Absolutely fine.

19:21.091 --> 19:23.072
And... So he's made...

19:23.107 --> 19:26.024
Oh no, he hasn't.

19:29.012 --> 19:31.013
AUDIENCE GROANS

19:31.048 --> 19:32.969
Told you. I told you.

19:33.004 --> 19:35.025
There are more letters.
Here's one that caught my eye.

19:35.060 --> 19:40.048
"Dear Top so-called Gear, why didn't
you use a Isetta Bubble Car instead?"

19:40.083 --> 19:42.017
It's a good point. Why didn't you?

19:42.052 --> 19:45.076
I've got one here - one wheel
at the back, two at the front.

19:45.111 --> 19:48.024
It's a more stable
three-wheeler configuration.

19:48.059 --> 19:50.977
Yeah. But this has another problem.

19:51.012 --> 19:54.024
What problem? Well, why
don't you fire it up, mate?

19:54.059 --> 19:56.973
The 300cc engine
bursting into life.

19:57.008 --> 20:01.052
Now, if you could drive into our imaginary
garage over here, that would be lovely.

20:01.087 --> 20:04.056
Oh, look. He hasn't fallen over.
Still hasn't fallen over.

20:04.091 --> 20:06.017
It's much better already.

20:06.052 --> 20:08.037
Just wait, Hammond. Here we go.

20:08.072 --> 20:11.068
OK, all the way into the garage,
please, mate. All the way in.

20:11.103 --> 20:14.064
You've got a foot to go. Six inches.
There you go. Marvellous.

20:14.099 --> 20:16.084
It hasn't fallen over.
It's much better.

20:16.119 --> 20:18.060
OK. Now, if you'd
like to get out...

20:19.060 --> 20:20.985
LAUGHTER

20:21.020 --> 20:24.989
Oh, yeah. I see your point.
The door's at the front.

20:25.024 --> 20:29.032
You'll have to back it up, mate. Yeah, go
on - reverse. OK. Where is reverse?

20:29.067 --> 20:30.977
Hasn't got one.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.014
LAUGHTER Really? No.

20:33.049 --> 20:34.981
So how does he get out?

20:35.016 --> 20:38.084
Well, this is the thing.
Honestly, if you think about it...

20:38.119 --> 20:39.993
If you don't listen...

20:40.028 --> 20:43.049
James, stop fingering the studio.

20:43.084 --> 20:45.981
The thing is, OK, that if
you had one of these cars,

20:46.016 --> 20:49.080
you got home like this, you got stuck
in your garage, there were two problems.

20:49.115 --> 20:53.005
You couldn't call inside your
house for your wife or girlfriend

20:53.040 --> 20:58.076
to come and rescue you, because it was the
1950s and the mobile telephone hadn't been
invented.

20:58.111 --> 21:04.020
And of course, if you had a car like this,
you wouldn't have a wife or a girlfriend.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.057
Very funny. Could you
push me out now, please?

21:06.092 --> 21:10.036
What? Would you give me a push?
Me push you out? Push you out...

21:10.071 --> 21:11.045
Er... Can we...?

21:11.080 --> 21:16.088
Sorry, what was the question? We could
either push him out or... Not do that. Not
do that.

21:16.123 --> 21:19.993
Can we push him out? Ah...
I think no.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.034
I'm coming down in favour
of no as well. Sorry, James.

21:23.069 --> 21:26.040
It's a no, sorry. It's aunanimous no.
See you, mate. Sorry.

21:26.075 --> 21:30.044
Right, well, let's
move it on, to this.

21:30.079 --> 21:32.012
To that, actually, over there.

21:32.047 --> 21:35.057
That is a Porsche 911.

21:35.092 --> 21:39.592
And one way or another, that has
been with us for about 1,000 years.

21:39.627 --> 21:44.092
Now, though, they've brought out
a sort of greatest hits version.

21:47.036 --> 21:48.973
Here it is.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.053
Porsche call is the Sport Classic.

21:51.088 --> 21:57.092
But I prefer to think of it as "Now That's
What I Call The Best Of The 911...

21:57.127 --> 21:59.977
"Volume One. "

22:00.012 --> 22:06.054
These duck-tail spoiler was originally
a hit for the 1973 Carrera 2.7 RS.

22:06.089 --> 22:12.096
The black headlamp surrounds were
first recorded by the 1974 Turbo RSR.

22:14.088 --> 22:21.088
The Fuchs alloys are a cover version
of the ones first seen on the 1966911S.

22:21.123 --> 22:26.008
And the wide-body rear arches
are from today's Carrera 4.

22:29.076 --> 22:31.965
Anyway, that's enough
band analogies.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.004
Let's see if this thing is as good as it
was before Peter Gabriel left Genesis.

22:36.039 --> 22:40.068
Starting, if we must,
with how fast it will go.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.012
You get 22 more horsepower than
you do in a standard Carrera S.

22:49.047 --> 22:52.084
That means 0-60 in 4.6 seconds.

22:52.119 --> 22:55.045
Top speed 188.

22:55.080 --> 22:59.084
And I suppose that means
I've got to go and do it.

23:10.024 --> 23:11.076
Argh!

23:22.048 --> 23:25.528
So, it's very fast,
very good looking,

23:25.563 --> 23:29.008
and surprisingly
soft and comfortable,

23:29.043 --> 23:31.000
but there is a problem.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.985
It's L140,000-

23:34.020 --> 23:37.018
twice what a normal
Carrera S costs.

23:37.053 --> 23:39.981
And they've only made 250 of them.

23:40.016 --> 23:42.080
And you can't buy one, because
they've all been sold.

23:46.016 --> 23:49.028
So let's move on to a
Porsche you can buy...

23:52.068 --> 23:55.021
.. the new Boxster Spyder.

23:55.056 --> 23:58.088
Porsche say this harks back
to the lightweight models

23:58.123 --> 24:00.061
James Dean was driving in the '50s.

24:00.096 --> 24:05.000
But frankly, that's a bit
of marketing cobblers.

24:05.035 --> 24:07.068
He was a rebel without an airbag.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.028
This does have an airbag.

24:12.063 --> 24:13.037
But that's about it.

24:13.072 --> 24:19.012
It's 80kg lighter than the standard
Boxster, thanks to aluminium doors,

24:19.047 --> 24:26.040
aluminium engine cover, super-light
wheels and carbon-fibre seats.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.042
There's more, or rather, less.

24:32.077 --> 24:34.049
There is no standard air-con.

24:34.084 --> 24:38.029
The door handles have been replaced
by these little bits of rag

24:38.064 --> 24:42.041
and they've even ditched the piece of
plastic that goes on top of the instruments.

24:42.076 --> 24:49.020
What Porsche do is, they leave a lot of
things that you should get on a Boxster on
a shelf in the factory

24:49.055 --> 24:53.016
and then they charge you more
for not giving them to you.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.017
This car costs L46,000.

24:57.052 --> 25:00.048
That's 5,000 more
than the standard car

25:00.083 --> 25:02.040
and you get less in return.

25:02.075 --> 25:04.985
Or do you?

25:05.020 --> 25:12.076
The 3.4 litre flat 6 now has 320
horsepower, 10 more than the standard
Boxsters.

25:14.052 --> 25:20.056
And because it's lighter, 0-60
is done in just five seconds.

25:27.052 --> 25:28.076
Top speed?

25:28.111 --> 25:31.020
166.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.012
I've owned the standard Boxster
S for the last four years

25:36.047 --> 25:38.088
and I can promise
you, this is better.

25:42.084 --> 25:44.997
It's more eager.

25:45.032 --> 25:46.096
It's bloody excellent.

25:50.052 --> 25:52.004
Hee-hee-hee!

25:53.092 --> 25:58.013
But all this stripped back Spyder
stuff does have its drawbacks.

25:58.048 --> 26:03.080
What if you're driving along with the roof
down and, suddenly, it starts to rain?

26:04.084 --> 26:07.066
Exactly. What a
remarkable coincidence.

26:07.101 --> 26:10.590
Oh no, I need to
erect the top tent.

26:10.625 --> 26:14.045
What you do is, you open the boot.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.070
You take out this piece, which
is called the sun shield.

26:18.105 --> 26:22.060
You get in the car, you
attach it at the front first.

26:22.095 --> 26:24.064
Ah!

26:26.036 --> 26:27.993
Like that...

26:28.028 --> 26:32.088
Then... You get
that bit behind you.

26:35.008 --> 26:36.080
Hang on.

26:37.080 --> 26:43.000
And then the other end of the same
wire goes on this special clamp

26:43.035 --> 26:47.052
and then these two bits
clip on to there...

26:47.087 --> 26:48.045
Oh, sh...

26:48.080 --> 26:53.080
'It was a nightmare. But I got it
finished just as the "rain" stopped.

26:57.056 --> 27:01.057
Top speed is now
reduced from 166 to 126

27:01.092 --> 27:06.024
because any faster than that
and the sky tent blows off.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.973
Frankly, I couldn't care less.

27:08.008 --> 27:13.060
Because the way this car feels is so
much more important than the top speed.

27:13.095 --> 27:14.969
This is a really happy car.

27:15.004 --> 27:17.049
It's full of vibrant
energy and enthusiasm.

27:17.084 --> 27:20.044
It's a bit like one of
those really stupid dogs.

27:20.079 --> 27:23.004
I bet if you threw a ball
it would chase after it.

27:24.004 --> 27:27.060
And it's having a bit of an
effect on me because to be honest,

27:27.095 --> 27:30.064
I have started behaving a bit
like the other two idiots.

27:32.076 --> 27:39.004
The really amazing thing is, in a car
as lithe and nimble as this, I can.

27:41.076 --> 27:49.044
I've said before that some cars give me a
strange fizzing sensation inside and this
one really does.

27:49.079 --> 27:51.028
I'm fizzing massively here.

27:52.032 --> 27:54.004
I'm fizzing fit to burst. Nurse!

27:56.056 --> 27:59.032
That's actually a
spin, but never mind.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.041
Never mind, indeed.

28:02.076 --> 28:08.000
What Porsche has done is take one of the
most practical everyday sports cars you can
buy

28:08.035 --> 28:10.096
and turned it into a
simple indulgence.

28:13.064 --> 28:16.064
And by making it simple they've
made it simply brilliant.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.060
APPLAUSE

28:27.024 --> 28:28.017
He will be disappointed.

28:28.052 --> 28:33.526
It is a shame James isn't here because I
didn't agree with everything he said then.

28:33.561 --> 28:39.000
It's a shame he's not here to stand up,
but never mind, will carry on without him.

28:39.035 --> 28:40.973
Start with this, the Sport Classic.

28:41.008 --> 28:43.985
It's a fabulous looking thing.
It's a fabulous car, actually.

28:44.020 --> 28:50.008
But the price! What I think happened here
is, they started off with a price and then
tried to justify it.

28:50.043 --> 28:53.036
No, I'm sorry, it is a pretty
thing, but this is worse.

28:53.071 --> 28:54.977
This really is worse.

28:55.012 --> 28:58.001
An umbrella, no door handles.
Honestly.

28:58.036 --> 29:02.076
So, I guess there's no point putting that
round the track because you can't buy it.

29:02.111 --> 29:04.049
We'll just put this
stupid thing round.

29:04.084 --> 29:08.548
I'll have to do the
commentary, obviously. Oi!

29:08.583 --> 29:12.977
While it's driven by
our tame racing driver.

29:13.012 --> 29:17.064
Some say there are 17 different
reasons why he's banned

29:17.099 --> 29:21.028
from the Northampton
branch of Little Chef.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.977
LAUGHTER

29:23.012 --> 29:27.016
And that his favourite
airline pilot is Mark Webber.

29:27.051 --> 29:28.053
LAUGHTER

29:28.088 --> 29:32.052
Me too, actually. All we know,
of course, it's the Stig!

29:32.087 --> 29:35.037
Oh no, he's facing
the wrong direction.

29:35.072 --> 29:40.008
Of course, it's a Boxster -
both ends look exactly the same.

29:40.043 --> 29:43.041
Off now, slowly, to
the first corner.

29:43.076 --> 29:46.040
Just slowly driving
through it really,

29:46.075 --> 29:47.981
in a not very interesting way.

29:48.016 --> 29:51.008
Nothing interesting at
all to report there.

29:55.012 --> 29:59.036
Stig, still enjoying his
new CD, Vuvuzela Moods.

29:59.071 --> 30:00.989
I should add that
this is made possible

30:01.024 --> 30:07.026
because Porsche has very kindly reinstated
the stereo they normally charge you L5,000
to remove.

30:07.061 --> 30:13.028
Plodding through the Hammerhead now in the
manner of a car that only a complete idiot
would like.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.064
Oh, dear. Bored.

30:19.024 --> 30:25.004
Little known fact, this is also the noise
Stig makes when he wants to attract a mate.

30:25.039 --> 30:26.997
Follow through, past some tyres.

30:27.032 --> 30:33.068
Wish I'd brought a magazine to read while
waiting for this stupid thing to haul its
way round.

30:33.103 --> 30:38.068
Not very interesting there, sort of
sliding there, and across the finish.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.096
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:43.096 --> 30:48.040
I don't mind that. don't like that.
I have the time here

30:48.075 --> 30:51.073
for a Boxster Spyder
and it did it in

30:51.108 --> 30:54.037
1:24.9 which actually
isn't bad at all.

30:54.072 --> 30:58.076
That puts it right up there.
No, notinterested in that at all. Let's put

30:58.111 --> 31:01.092
a star in our brand new
reasonably priced car.

31:01.127 --> 31:04.021
Now, my guest tonight
began his career

31:04.056 --> 31:08.566
writing pornographic stories
for a gentlemen's magazine.

31:08.601 --> 31:13.041
He then went on to be communications
director for Tony Blair

31:13.076 --> 31:18.072
and Gordon Brown, so he spent most
of his adult life working with...

31:18.107 --> 31:19.577
penises.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.013
LAUGHTER

31:21.048 --> 31:24.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alastair Campbell!

31:27.040 --> 31:29.056
How are you? All right.

31:29.091 --> 31:32.041
BOOING

31:32.076 --> 31:34.052
Go on then, go on then!

31:36.044 --> 31:37.993
Two of the best people.

31:38.028 --> 31:42.080
Well, you've come in to the den
oflions here. Yeah, they're all right!

31:42.115 --> 31:46.000
You don't know yet.
It is tricky, I have to be honest,

31:46.035 --> 31:49.032
thinking about how this
interview might go.

31:49.067 --> 31:51.048
Me, you... Yeah... left, right.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.044
Not necessarily right.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.037
Wrong.

31:54.072 --> 31:56.981
LAUGHTER The thing
is, I don't believe

31:57.016 --> 32:00.044
what I write any more than
you believe what you say.

32:00.079 --> 32:02.001
So... LAUGHTER

32:02.036 --> 32:05.048
.. interesting sitting here.
We've got to do this interview

32:05.083 --> 32:07.072
and, at some point, we've
got to get to the lap

32:07.107 --> 32:09.033
which is all cheery.

32:09.068 --> 32:12.060
I prepared some questions that
I hope aren't too contentious.

32:12.095 --> 32:14.061
OK, I thought you would.

32:14.096 --> 32:16.076
A lot of work gone into these.

32:16.111 --> 32:18.005
Good.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.000
What is your favourite colour?

32:20.035 --> 32:21.981
LAUGHTER

32:22.016 --> 32:25.030
I've got two. Claret and blue.

32:25.065 --> 32:28.044
Blue? I wasn't expecting blue.

32:28.079 --> 32:29.969
Burnley Football Club.

32:30.004 --> 32:34.008
Burnley? I'm fascinated by your
love of, erm, football. Mm-hm.

32:34.043 --> 32:38.012
Because you're a Yorkshireman
but you support Burnley. Yup.

32:38.047 --> 32:39.977
Isn't that a bit
like, I don't know,

32:40.012 --> 32:43.080
going to an Oxbridge college and
then joining the Labour Party?

32:43.115 --> 32:46.040
LAUGHTER AND GASPS

32:47.044 --> 32:50.973
Lots did and lots have.

32:51.008 --> 32:54.048
But Burnley back then were one
of the biggest and best teams

32:54.083 --> 32:57.088
in the country and they were 20
miles away from where I lived.

32:57.123 --> 33:00.037
What star sign are you? Gemini.

33:00.072 --> 33:03.088
I don't know anything about
Gemini, except my wife's one.

33:03.123 --> 33:04.993
LAUGHTER

33:05.028 --> 33:06.072
D'you want to marry me?

33:08.052 --> 33:13.032
No?! No. I'm going to get
political now. Go on, then.

33:13.067 --> 33:16.017
Here we go. So you
started out writing porn.

33:16.052 --> 33:19.041
I mean that was Forum magazine.
Was that right? Yeah.

33:19.076 --> 33:23.024
And then you became Blair's.
You were communications director.

33:23.059 --> 33:25.088
There was a gap.
There was a gap but eventually...

33:25.123 --> 33:28.040
So you did something
noble and then ended up

33:28.075 --> 33:30.033
sort of prostituting yourself

33:30.068 --> 33:31.993
which I think is a weird way round.

33:32.028 --> 33:36.000
I want to move on to Gordon Brown,
who lost the general election

33:36.035 --> 33:37.088
and has now disappeared.

33:37.123 --> 33:39.993
CHUCKLING

33:40.028 --> 33:42.516
Two-part question,
and a serious one.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.969
You were obviously in
charge of the image

33:45.004 --> 33:47.025
and how the election was
presented to the people.

33:47.060 --> 33:51.076
Two parts. Who was it that
told him that he had to smile,

33:51.111 --> 33:53.084
and then why did no-one
tell him to stop?

33:53.119 --> 33:55.049
LAUGHTER

33:55.084 --> 33:58.076
Well, I wasn't in charge.
I would have been in charge if we won,

33:58.111 --> 34:01.000
but we didn't win.
So I wasn't in charge at all.

34:01.035 --> 34:02.053
LAUGHTER

34:02.088 --> 34:05.032
I don't think you can
tell anybody to smile.

34:06.036 --> 34:08.083
But I think it was
possibly his misfortune

34:08.119 --> 34:10.965
that he followed a Prime Minister

34:11.000 --> 34:13.080
who does smile a lot
very, very naturally.

34:13.114 --> 34:15.009
Not like that. He did.

34:15.043 --> 34:18.530
He's got nicer teeth than you,Jeremy.
He looks after them. Yes,

34:18.565 --> 34:22.016
he probably used taxpayers'...
Did they go on expenses, his teeth?

34:22.051 --> 34:26.036
No. No, they didn't.
Don't applaud. APPLAUSE

34:26.072 --> 34:30.083
It just occurred to me...
Don't applaud that. If I may,

34:30.119 --> 34:33.071
if I may, OK, I have
some footage here.

34:33.106 --> 34:36.024
I just want to see
Gordon Brown here, OK?

34:36.059 --> 34:38.072
Here he is. And ready, steady...

34:38.107 --> 34:41.021
LAUGHTER

34:41.056 --> 34:45.007
But look - he lightened up the
room, didn't he? That was nice.

34:45.043 --> 34:47.092
Was it done with
electricity, or...?LAUGHTER

34:47.127 --> 34:48.591
Fzzzzcrrkkk!

34:48.626 --> 34:50.021
LAUGHTER

34:50.056 --> 34:52.056
The thing is, you did
Tweet, I believe,

34:52.092 --> 34:56.043
earlier this week saying, "How do I
handle Clarkson, any suggestions?"

34:56.079 --> 34:59.041
I got a lot. Really? Yeah.
Murder, kill...

34:59.076 --> 35:02.080
Some of those.
"Kick him in the nuts. "

35:02.115 --> 35:05.049
Mm-hm. Yeah.
"Ask him how he voted. "

35:05.084 --> 35:09.020
Do you know, I think it
is none of your business.

35:09.055 --> 35:09.993
OK, fair enough.

35:10.028 --> 35:12.032
INDISTINCT RESPONSE I'm
going to make a guess.

35:12.067 --> 35:13.969
Go on then. Tory.

35:14.004 --> 35:16.514
That would mean voting for
my next door neighbour.

35:16.549 --> 35:19.280
Anyway, they didn't win.
Cameron? No, he did win.

35:19.315 --> 35:21.977
Well, he didn't really.
Well, he's the Prime Minister.

35:22.012 --> 35:25.076
He's the Prime Minister but he
needs little Cleggo, doesn't he?

35:25.111 --> 35:27.028
He needs the tea boy, I agree.

35:27.063 --> 35:28.561
LAUGHTER

35:28.596 --> 35:30.334
HE SNORTS

35:30.369 --> 35:32.037
I... I...

35:32.072 --> 35:36.045
Anyway, when do we see the lap?
No, not yet, not yet

35:36.080 --> 35:40.048
because I want to talk about
your books. Do you? Yeah. OK.

35:40.083 --> 35:42.061
You say that you get
inspiration for writing them

35:42.096 --> 35:48.028
when you are driving along.
Is that a distraction for your driver, or?

35:48.063 --> 35:51.973
LAUGHTER

35:52.008 --> 35:53.021
Honestly, in your book... OK.

35:53.056 --> 35:59.058
.. Prelude to Power, which is your
diaries, pretty much in detail.

35:59.093 --> 36:05.060
That's, how many pages?
744 pages and it only gets us up to 1997.

36:05.095 --> 36:07.969
So, the actual "Prelude to Power".

36:08.004 --> 36:10.088
That's five times longer
than War and Peace.

36:10.123 --> 36:12.013
I write a diary every day. You do?

36:12.048 --> 36:15.009
You really do write every day?
You will be in there tonight.

36:15.044 --> 36:18.092
The chat we have outside about the
director general will be in there...

36:18.127 --> 36:20.989
Oh, bloody hell! It was as well.

36:21.024 --> 36:25.024
I do a diary. I said that he wasa
very well-endowed man. Yes, yes.

36:25.059 --> 36:30.065
Now, there is a lot about Clause
Four, and all of the things

36:30.100 --> 36:34.562
that were being changed prior
to His Tony-ness's appointment.

36:34.597 --> 36:38.989
I couldn't find a single reference
to the most important thing

36:39.024 --> 36:43.012
that happened when he became Prime
Minister which was the M4 bus lane.

36:43.047 --> 36:44.033
Hmm.

36:44.068 --> 36:47.965
Was that just a whim then?
Was it not planned?

36:48.000 --> 36:52.064
No, the thing is, Jeremy, as you
rightly say, it goes up to 1997.

36:52.099 --> 36:54.025
Mm-hm. Volume two

36:54.060 --> 37:00.096
is subtitled "The M4 bus lane.
In full. " I was terrified

37:00.131 --> 37:03.969
that John Prescott had
walked in one day and gone,

37:04.004 --> 37:07.068
"Hey, I tell you what, let's paint
outside lane on t'motorway red

37:07.103 --> 37:08.595
"and make it a bus lane. " Aye.

37:08.630 --> 37:10.053
And that's not what happened? No.

37:10.088 --> 37:15.044
There was a thought that it might
alleviate some of the congestion

37:15.079 --> 37:18.044
and, according to the
statistical analysis

37:18.079 --> 37:20.045
thereafter, it kind of worked.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.588
But YOU can't accept that
because you want to cover

37:22.623 --> 37:25.096
the whole country in concrete
and drive in big cars.

37:25.131 --> 37:26.591
Yeah. Yeah.

37:26.626 --> 37:28.017
LAUGHTER

37:28.052 --> 37:29.053
The other thing as well,

37:29.088 --> 37:32.033
what did you think of our
new reasonably priced car?

37:32.068 --> 37:36.054
Because you're the first person to
drive it in this proper situation.

37:36.089 --> 37:40.040
I quite liked it. Once I'd got
into really kind of leathering it,

37:40.075 --> 37:42.005
it didn't have a lot of oomph.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.072
I think The Stig was really patient,
he really was. Top man. Really?

37:46.107 --> 37:49.056
I was kind of half hoping
it would be a woman.

37:49.091 --> 37:53.965
Some say he's
fanatically right wing.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.072
No, he told me he's not.
Really? He says you are.

37:57.107 --> 37:58.965
SCOFFS

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
See? You're just believing what
it says in the papers again.

38:02.035 --> 38:06.088
No, I know you're a
reasonable, fair-minded chap.

38:06.123 --> 38:08.009
No!

38:08.044 --> 38:09.061
LAUGHTER

38:09.096 --> 38:13.025
Anyway, who wants
to see the lap?I do.

38:13.060 --> 38:16.088
You do. Let's play the tape.
Let's have a look.

38:16.123 --> 38:17.973
WHEELSPIN SCREECH

38:18.008 --> 38:20.060
'Here we are.
That wasn't me, was it?'

38:20.095 --> 38:21.053
'Not bad. Was it all right?

38:21.088 --> 38:25.028
'Dunno, actually.
'Come on, concentrate.

38:25.063 --> 38:27.989
Remember everything he said.

38:28.024 --> 38:32.012
'Let's have a look through the first corner.
I'm going to see this car...

38:32.047 --> 38:34.965
'Well, going to see it going
all round the track. '

38:35.000 --> 38:38.500
Nick Clegg should do this cos he
hasn't got an awful lot to do.

38:38.535 --> 38:42.000
'Now, you've got to stay right here.
Oh, no, you've veered left.

38:42.035 --> 38:43.028
'There's a surprise

38:44.048 --> 38:46.049
'On your way down
to the hammerhead.

38:46.084 --> 38:49.070
'It understeers more than
the old Chevrolet, this car.

38:49.105 --> 38:52.056
'Doesn't look like it's going
as fast as I thought it was.

38:52.091 --> 38:54.061
'Everyone says that.
But you keep... '

38:54.096 --> 38:55.997
You ARE veering to the left!
Oh God, yeah.

38:56.032 --> 38:59.048
'No, here we go. This is flat out.
Were you flat-out from your...?

38:59.083 --> 39:01.577
'Felt flat-out, yeah. ' BLEEP!

39:01.612 --> 39:04.037
'Are you competitive? Very. '

39:04.072 --> 39:07.024
I just want to beat
Nick Robinson tonight.

39:08.040 --> 39:12.024
'Yes, that's nicely done through
there, you cut the corner very well.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.965
'I had real trouble down there.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.004
'I kept going into 5th.
That's bang...

39:16.039 --> 39:17.001
'Not quite fast enough.

39:17.036 --> 39:20.528
'You were in 5th?
At one point, yeah. Wrong!

39:20.563 --> 39:24.020
'And there we are.
And boing! Across the line!'

39:30.024 --> 39:32.020
So...

39:34.024 --> 39:36.025
So...

39:36.060 --> 39:38.057
where do you think
you've come there?

39:38.092 --> 39:42.036
I'm quite keen to beatNick Robinson.
There's a surprise,

39:42.071 --> 39:43.068
the BBC political editor.

39:43.103 --> 39:44.977
You did it,

39:45.012 --> 39:48.056
Alastair Campbell, in one minute...

39:48.091 --> 39:52.965
That's good... 40...

39:53.000 --> 39:55.057
So bearing in mind he was at 49.9,

39:55.092 --> 39:58.096
you would have a job squeaking
in after him. I'm doing well...

39:58.131 --> 40:01.579
1:47 dead.

40:01.614 --> 40:04.993
Oooh...

40:05.028 --> 40:07.052
That puts you as
our second fastest.

40:07.087 --> 40:09.047
CHEERING

40:09.082 --> 40:10.973
That's OK.

40:11.008 --> 40:13.508
Well done. No, that's very good.

40:13.543 --> 40:16.008
My name fell down.
That's very good.

40:16.043 --> 40:17.017
It fell down.

40:17.052 --> 40:19.040
Your name's fell down?

40:19.075 --> 40:21.041
Yeah. LAUGHTER

40:21.076 --> 40:22.973
Can we do that bit again?

40:23.008 --> 40:26.092
It can stay there.
Why have you lost the magnetism?

40:26.127 --> 40:29.028
Because we don't get
enough licence fee,

40:29.063 --> 40:31.008
thanks to you lot. There you are.

40:31.043 --> 40:32.977
So I beat Al Murray.

40:33.012 --> 40:36.048
You're faster than Al Murray.
And aPage Three girl. Peta, 23, Essex.

40:36.083 --> 40:37.965
And Nick Robinson. Nick Robinson.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.061
Next time he interviews
you, you can go,

40:39.096 --> 40:43.044
"I'm faster than you. I'm faster than you.
I'm faster than you. "

40:43.079 --> 40:45.053
And then hit him. LAUGHTER

40:45.088 --> 40:47.057
You're a huge sport
for coming down here.

40:47.092 --> 40:51.020
Best of luck. I enjoyed it.
Alastair Campbell! Thank you.

40:51.055 --> 40:52.088
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:53.088 --> 40:55.008
Marvellous.

41:01.036 --> 41:06.542
Now, now, earlier on, we proved
that this BMW M3 is better

41:06.577 --> 41:12.048
in pretty much every way than
this Mercedes and this Ford.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.005
Because of racism...
Yeah, whatever.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.064
Now it's time to go back
to Germany so that the BMW

41:17.099 --> 41:19.969
can win all the
other tests as well.

41:20.004 --> 41:23.064
We begin with Jeremy,
predictably, moaning.

41:25.096 --> 41:30.032
This part of the world was ruined
first of all by Hitler then Stalin

41:30.067 --> 41:34.004
and now Jonathan Porridge with
his windmills. I like 'em.

41:34.039 --> 41:36.060
They're noisy, they're pointless.

41:37.060 --> 41:39.037
Oh, hello. Right.

41:39.072 --> 41:42.548
"Your cars will now
be tested for faults

41:42.583 --> 41:46.024
"by ADAC, Germany's
equivalent of the AA."

41:47.096 --> 41:51.028
We test them now, after we've maxed
them on the autobahn, brilliant

41:51.063 --> 41:51.997
It won't hurt them.

41:52.032 --> 41:57.048
Apparently "one of ADAC's mobile
patrols will arrive shortly".

41:57.083 --> 41:59.061
So we're looking for a van.

41:59.096 --> 42:02.016
It'll be a van of some sort.
That's all right.

42:02.051 --> 42:03.061
'It was a van,

42:03.096 --> 42:06.020
'but this being Germany... '

42:22.072 --> 42:26.070
It's got a reception, look.
Look, it has.

42:26.105 --> 42:30.068
'The ADAC men took
charge of James's Merc. '

42:30.103 --> 42:32.068
Guten tag, Klaus. Hi.

42:32.103 --> 42:33.088
Fortschritt.

42:34.096 --> 42:37.049
JEREMY CHUCKLES

42:37.084 --> 42:39.033
What's wrong with the car?

42:39.068 --> 42:41.969
His racing gearbox is going well.

42:42.004 --> 42:45.084
'The equipment they had in
the van was extraordinary

42:45.119 --> 42:47.969
'and the tests were very thorough.

42:48.004 --> 42:50.092
'They used a computer to
measure the boiling point

42:50.127 --> 42:52.001
'of the Merc's brake fluid

42:52.036 --> 42:56.024
'and a gizmo to check the
roundness of its tyres. '

42:56.059 --> 42:58.985
There's a laser and everything.

42:59.020 --> 43:01.056
'It was doing quite
well, but then... '

43:03.092 --> 43:05.008
Oh, dear.

43:05.048 --> 43:06.989
Scheisse!

43:07.024 --> 43:10.021
What a load of rubbish!

43:10.056 --> 43:13.004
'After this, things got worse. '

43:13.039 --> 43:17.061
CLUNKING JEREMY HOOTS

43:17.096 --> 43:20.056
I did 140 miles an hour.
You did 140 miles an hour,

43:20.091 --> 43:23.045
and your wheels... nicht gut.

43:23.080 --> 43:26.049
.. Are very bad, you
have let them rust.

43:26.084 --> 43:31.044
'It was time I put these German
chappies straight on a few things. '

43:31.079 --> 43:33.041
Martin Brundle was
sehr gut uber dem auto.

43:33.076 --> 43:36.044
What was that you just
said about Martin Brundle?

43:36.079 --> 43:37.981
I was just saying

43:38.016 --> 43:39.017
how Martin Brundle said

43:39.052 --> 43:43.008
that this was the finest rear-drive
chassis he'd ever driven.

43:43.043 --> 43:44.549
He never said any...

43:44.584 --> 43:46.318
He did! He had one.

43:46.353 --> 43:48.017
He did not say...

43:48.052 --> 43:52.088
Unluckily for you, mate, I
have Martin Brundle's number

43:52.123 --> 43:55.056
on my telephone.
He will confirm that he said that

43:55.091 --> 43:56.041
and that he had one.

43:56.076 --> 44:00.028
This, he claimed, was the best?
! And famously said that.

44:00.063 --> 44:01.037
'Hello?' Martin?

44:01.072 --> 44:04.040
I'll talk to him. No, get off.
Martin? Let me talk to him.

44:05.092 --> 44:09.004
Martin, morning, it's James
from Top Gear. Hi, how are you?

44:09.039 --> 44:11.009
'Yeah, good, are you
somewhere exciting?'

44:11.044 --> 44:13.985
I'm underneath a Mercedes
190 Cosworth, actually,

44:14.020 --> 44:17.016
and the other two won't believe
me when I say that you said

44:17.051 --> 44:19.059
quite categorically
that this was the finest

44:19.094 --> 44:21.068
rear-drive chassis of
any car in the world

44:21.103 --> 44:23.040
and the best you'd ever driven.

44:23.075 --> 44:24.045
'When did I say that?

44:24.080 --> 44:28.020
'I've had a few knocks on the head
but I don't remember saying that.

44:29.032 --> 44:30.013
'It's not a bad engine

44:30.048 --> 44:32.544
'but, no, it's
really not that good.

44:32.579 --> 44:35.005
'You need the M3 for
the best chassis

44:35.040 --> 44:37.033
'from around that time,
I would have thought. '

44:37.068 --> 44:41.016
That was always my belief that
people believed the M3 was better

44:41.051 --> 44:43.005
and it had got this
folkloric reputation

44:43.040 --> 44:46.056
but anybody who knew what they
were talking about, ie you,

44:46.091 --> 44:48.981
Ayrton Senna, knew that
actually the Mercedes

44:49.016 --> 44:51.033
was the superior car.
'I don't remember Ayrton getting out

44:51.068 --> 44:54.088
'and saying, "That is the best rear
drive chassis I've ever been in. "

44:54.123 --> 44:56.973
'I think he got out and said,

44:57.008 --> 45:00.080
'"I'm pleased it thrashed Lauda
and Prost and all those guys. "'

45:00.115 --> 45:04.028
Niki Lauda and Alain Prost as well?
I didn't know that.

45:04.063 --> 45:06.005
You don't need to speak to him...

45:06.040 --> 45:09.985
I do need to speak to him.
Martin? You've turned it off.

45:10.020 --> 45:14.044
He's catching an aeroplaneto his
second home. What did he say?

45:14.079 --> 45:18.060
He confirmed everything I
said about him. He also said,

45:18.095 --> 45:19.969
"The engine is excellent

45:20.004 --> 45:23.040
"and the M3 was a mere shadow
of what this car was. "

45:23.075 --> 45:24.989
Did he? That's what he said?
Yes he did.

45:25.024 --> 45:29.060
That's what he said? Yes.
That'swhat he said? Right, lower the car.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.044
'Next it was the turn
of my Cosworth. '

45:34.079 --> 45:39.028
Mein auto ist die einzige mit...

45:39.063 --> 45:42.032
TRANSLATION FROM GERMAN:

45:44.096 --> 45:50.000
Mein auto ist designen
von eine Deutsche. Yah!

45:50.035 --> 45:51.037
Good. OK.

45:51.072 --> 45:52.041
Just making it plain.

45:52.076 --> 45:55.570
I don't want him to mark it
down because it's Belgian.

45:55.605 --> 45:59.064
As it happens the ADAC man
was impressed with my car.

45:59.099 --> 46:00.997
Good?

46:01.032 --> 46:02.993
All good! All good!

46:03.028 --> 46:05.060
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

46:07.040 --> 46:10.072
'But it would now be humiliated
by the much younger M3.'

46:10.107 --> 46:12.033
I hate to say this

46:12.068 --> 46:16.016
because it's verging on
complementing you but your car

46:16.051 --> 46:18.084
is now quite cool and
collectible whereas that is

46:18.119 --> 46:21.076
just something driven by...
Imbeciles.

46:21.111 --> 46:25.076
TRANSLATED FROM GERMAN:

46:28.028 --> 46:34.040
Best car? Sehr gut.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. It is.

46:34.075 --> 46:37.973
'As it turned out, it wasn't. '

46:38.008 --> 46:41.060
Crikey, look at that.
That's the anti-roll bar, isn't it?

46:41.095 --> 46:44.080
It had an accident... Kaput.

46:44.115 --> 46:47.977
JEREMY CACKLES

46:48.012 --> 46:50.072
That's why you got a
different shock absorber.

46:50.107 --> 46:52.977
It's been botched together.

46:53.012 --> 46:55.530
It has clearly had
a crash, hasn't it?

46:55.565 --> 46:58.048
'Soon it was time
to get our scores. '

46:59.036 --> 47:01.049
And that's your Ford.

47:01.084 --> 47:03.066
The Ford. And the BMW. Thank you.

47:03.101 --> 47:05.554
What would be a good score on this?

47:05.589 --> 47:07.973
A new car would
score, a good car...

47:08.008 --> 47:11.000
150 points. I will go first
with my score. Are we ready?

47:12.044 --> 47:14.096
58. 58? That's good.

47:14.131 --> 47:16.087
...19.

47:16.122 --> 47:18.009
19?! Mmm.

47:18.044 --> 47:20.032
That's not so good. No.

47:20.067 --> 47:22.080
Hammond? Six.

47:24.048 --> 47:26.084
He's not serious?! Six?

47:26.119 --> 47:27.057
Six, yes.

47:27.092 --> 47:30.056
Six?! That's right.

47:30.091 --> 47:33.020
Bu...? The Ford!

47:34.024 --> 47:36.056
How have I only got six?

47:36.091 --> 47:38.088
The back is very bad. Yeah.

47:38.123 --> 47:41.017
58- that's a pass.

47:41.052 --> 47:44.062
Six?! You might as
well have gotnought.

47:44.097 --> 47:47.072
Would you say the BMW
is dangerous?Yes.

47:49.028 --> 47:53.008
This had a dramatic effect
on the way Hammond drove.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.061
Six.

47:58.096 --> 48:01.001
I don't know how it
could score less.

48:01.036 --> 48:04.032
It would have to have,
like, wheels missing

48:04.067 --> 48:06.024
or a tiger in it.

48:08.012 --> 48:09.989
Tonight on First Gear,

48:10.024 --> 48:15.048
Richard Hammond drives across
Germany in a death trap.

48:15.092 --> 48:19.016
'Hammond's mood wasn't
improved when he found out

48:19.051 --> 48:21.048
'where we'd be staying the night. '

48:25.024 --> 48:28.000
You've got to be kidding.

48:30.004 --> 48:33.016
'Yup! Colditz is now a hotel. '

48:37.036 --> 48:38.076
OK.

48:50.044 --> 48:52.056
'The next morning, James
and Richard checked out

48:53.016 --> 48:54.088
'in the traditional fashion. '

48:54.123 --> 48:58.092
"Colditz Theme"

49:14.060 --> 49:15.997
Where have you two been?

49:16.032 --> 49:19.052
How did you get out? I used
mycredit card at the reception desk.

49:19.087 --> 49:21.005
I don't know why we
all didn't do that.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.040
It wouldn't make for a
good TV series, would it?

49:23.075 --> 49:24.053
It wouldn't have had 28 episodes.

49:24.088 --> 49:28.040
Next, Major Pat Reid denies watching
the movie that was on his bill.

49:30.048 --> 49:34.056
'To Richard's consternation, it
was then time for our track day.

49:34.064 --> 49:39.032
'The producers insisted we stuck
to track day etiquette by wearing

49:39.067 --> 49:44.000
'clothing from the catalogues of
the companies that made our cars. '

49:45.032 --> 49:46.049
Holy

49:46.084 --> 49:48.548
Moly! Ooh, that's daddy's.

49:48.583 --> 49:50.977
That's not a good look.

49:51.012 --> 49:53.033
It says a lot about people
who drive Mercedes Benz.

49:53.068 --> 49:56.044
It does, and do you know, as
of Monday morning, I don't,

49:56.079 --> 49:57.053
any more!

49:57.088 --> 50:02.028
If there was a fire around here,
imagine the melting...! Ah!

50:02.063 --> 50:04.045
Now, the most important challenge -

50:04.080 --> 50:08.020
"Which of you has the
fastest track day car?

50:08.055 --> 50:10.029
"To make sure this test is fair,

50:10.064 --> 50:14.973
"each of your cars will be
drivenby the same driver. " Yes!

50:15.008 --> 50:18.064
I don't have to go out there in
the death trap... Oh, yes, you do.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.037
"You will be in the passenger seat

50:20.072 --> 50:23.060
"while the car is driven
by a tame racing driver. "

50:23.095 --> 50:26.084
What, the Stig?
No, he's not the Stig.

50:26.119 --> 50:30.064
He's the Stig's German cousin.

50:35.064 --> 50:39.040
Looks like the Stig to me.
Still the Stig. Still the St...

50:39.075 --> 50:41.079
It is the Stig! No, hang on.

50:41.114 --> 50:43.049
Oh, my giddy aunt. Mullet.

50:43.084 --> 50:46.076
I think it might be
Stiggy Ray Cyrus.

50:46.111 --> 50:49.020
First up for Herr Stig

50:49.055 --> 50:50.076
was the Mercedes.

50:53.036 --> 50:55.004
Go!

50:56.080 --> 50:58.969
ROUGH ENGINE ROAR

50:59.004 --> 51:01.024
That doesn't sound good.

51:04.052 --> 51:07.056
You've got to remember that in
the ADAC tests, they revealed

51:07.091 --> 51:08.989
that the steering was a bit loose.

51:09.024 --> 51:12.020
There's a lot of play in the rack,
so just don't overdo it, OK?

51:14.020 --> 51:15.096
Bloody hell!

51:18.032 --> 51:21.032
'To compensate for the
Merc's lack of power,

51:21.067 --> 51:23.052
'German Stig was on
maximum attack. '

51:27.056 --> 51:30.989
So this is bigger than the
Nurburgring, right, this track?

51:31.024 --> 51:35.068
Must be, cos of the amount of time
it's taken. Must be 35 miles. Yeah.

51:36.072 --> 51:41.056
You can feel the multi-link,
Martin Brundle-approved,

51:41.091 --> 51:46.040
rear suspension hunkering down...
Get a grip, man!

51:50.092 --> 51:57.092
It's 2 mins 19.3, and we've
no idea what that means.

51:59.048 --> 52:00.969
'But we'd soon find out,

52:01.004 --> 52:04.056
'because it was time
to lap the Ford. '

52:06.060 --> 52:09.068
And the muscles from
Brussels is under way!

52:09.103 --> 52:12.081
The Jean-Claude Van Damme-anator!

52:12.116 --> 52:15.060
That rear suspension is collapsed.

52:16.068 --> 52:21.025
This is... pure track day magic.

52:21.060 --> 52:27.032
1,250 kilograms, that's all
it weighs, the same as a Mini.

52:27.067 --> 52:29.032
But it has 200 horsepower!

52:30.068 --> 52:32.009
So, this German Stig fella...

52:32.044 --> 52:35.056
will he take well to Jeremy shouting
at him and stuff, do you think?

52:35.091 --> 52:36.989
He didn't take any notice of me

52:37.024 --> 52:40.004
when I told him which gearto
change into. Who would?

52:41.016 --> 52:43.029
This is the car which has won

52:43.064 --> 52:45.969
the British Touring
Car Championship,

52:46.004 --> 52:50.072
the World Touring Car Championship,
the British Rally Championship!

52:52.060 --> 52:55.056
Das Stig is a maniac!

52:56.092 --> 52:58.080
Here he comes.

53:01.048 --> 53:03.044
Wall, wall, wall.

53:04.068 --> 53:05.088
This is going to be close.

53:05.123 --> 53:09.028
12, 13, 14.

53:12.008 --> 53:13.021
Come on, let's have it.

53:13.056 --> 53:17.068
Two... Yep. 14. Ooh-hoo-hoo!

53:17.103 --> 53:19.053
Five seconds faster!

53:19.088 --> 53:23.052
'All that remained was to lap
Hammond's crash-damaged death trap. '

53:23.087 --> 53:26.064
There are quite a lot of right
hand turns, aren't there,

53:26.099 --> 53:27.965
in that first bit? Yeah.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.012
You're really putting a lot of
stress on the front left suspension.

53:31.047 --> 53:34.033
Exactly. If your car had
had, let's say, an accident,

53:34.068 --> 53:37.020
and had been mended cheaply
on the front left corner...

53:37.055 --> 53:39.008
Stop talking.

53:40.076 --> 53:44.048
Now, Herr Stig, there's one
important thing I have to tell you

53:44.083 --> 53:46.056
about this car before we set off...

53:46.091 --> 53:49.001
No, I didn't mean set off!

53:49.036 --> 53:52.004
I haven't told you the thing!
What about the thing?

53:53.096 --> 53:56.052
Are you cold? No.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.096
Go right. Go right.

54:07.020 --> 54:09.001
D'you know what I'm
expecting to see? Er...

54:09.036 --> 54:12.080
Just the front wheel coming across
the line in about two minutes' time.

54:19.032 --> 54:20.037
I'm just waiting to hear

54:20.072 --> 54:23.040
the unmistakable sound
of metal snapping.

54:26.028 --> 54:29.084
And the... of arterial blood.

54:32.008 --> 54:33.072
Wall!

54:34.028 --> 54:37.036
110 miles an hour in
a car that scored 6.

54:46.044 --> 54:48.568
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

54:48.603 --> 54:51.092
The board. The points.

54:51.127 --> 54:53.071
Here we go.

54:53.106 --> 54:54.981
Yes. What?

54:55.016 --> 54:58.096
Oh, come on, then, what was the time
for the BM, what was the lap time?

54:58.131 --> 55:00.021
I've forgotten.

55:00.056 --> 55:02.064
The time, what was it, come on?

55:02.099 --> 55:03.973
Seriously.

55:04.008 --> 55:05.053
What did he do it in? 2.06.

55:05.088 --> 55:08.001
Yes! Thank you very much,
I win that. So, yeah,

55:08.036 --> 55:11.056
you get one point for every
second underneath three minutes,

55:11.091 --> 55:12.057
so 2.06...

55:12.092 --> 55:15.080
54 points... Oh, yeah... for you.

55:15.115 --> 55:17.016
Why is that 3.14?

55:17.051 --> 55:18.029
What?

55:18.064 --> 55:20.080
Well, I did the lap
in 2 minutes 14.

55:20.115 --> 55:22.096
But, you see, the
producer disagrees.

55:22.131 --> 55:23.973
Why? Well,

55:24.008 --> 55:28.012
it was that new producer we've
got, the one from Uruguay.

55:28.047 --> 55:32.016
Sorry, mate, he's right, he
didn't see one of those minutes,

55:32.051 --> 55:33.009
so you can't have it.

55:33.044 --> 55:36.096
It was on television!
That'sinadmissible. It doesn't count.

55:36.131 --> 55:38.025
This is ridiculous. Bad luck.

55:38.060 --> 55:43.004
Moving on. So that means my BMW
was the fastest on the autobahn,

55:43.039 --> 55:45.025
it was the most
spacious in that test,

55:45.060 --> 55:46.977
and then it put in the fastest lap.

55:47.012 --> 55:49.032
Well, I will now garner
back some points,

55:49.067 --> 55:50.985
because it's the YouTube section.

55:51.020 --> 55:54.072
As we know, people
who go to track days,

55:54.107 --> 55:56.021
they put a camera on the dashboard,

55:56.056 --> 56:00.032
they record their lap, they
put that lap on YouTube.

56:00.067 --> 56:02.973
And we were told to
do the same thing, OK?

56:03.008 --> 56:07.032
And then there would be one
point for every hit we got.

56:07.067 --> 56:11.056
James, I believe now we have a
clip from your Mercedes lap?

56:11.091 --> 56:13.009
Let's have a look at that now.

56:13.044 --> 56:17.072
'And we're off. A little bit of
tramping from the axle there.

56:17.107 --> 56:19.997
'Then I'm going to
select fourth as we come

56:20.032 --> 56:23.016
'up to the end of the straight,
and we go in to turn one.

56:23.051 --> 56:25.068
'As we go round turn one... Oh...

56:25.103 --> 56:27.981
'Oh, cock. As you can see,

56:28.016 --> 56:30.973
'there are bollards on
the circuit, which is not

56:31.008 --> 56:34.088
'what I was expecting, and must
mean I've gone the wrong way. '

56:34.123 --> 56:39.012
How can you get lost on a
racetrack, mate? I don't...

56:39.047 --> 56:39.989
I don't... It's one way.

56:40.024 --> 56:42.546
I know, I don't understan
d it,I'm sorry. All right.

56:42.581 --> 56:45.068
Let's have a look at a
clip from Jeremy's video.

56:45.103 --> 56:49.072
'Coming up now to the end of a lap.

56:49.107 --> 56:52.985
'I'm doing 195 miles an hour,

56:53.020 --> 56:58.004
'200, 210 miles an hour now, 220...

56:58.039 --> 56:59.037
'And I cross the line. '

56:59.072 --> 57:03.045
What? You just lied and then
sped up the film. A bit.

57:03.080 --> 57:07.004
A lot! A bit. Let's have a look
atyour lap in the death trap.

57:07.039 --> 57:08.993
All right. Here we go.

57:09.028 --> 57:11.005
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

57:11.040 --> 57:13.056
And listen to that straight six!

57:13.091 --> 57:15.017
Brvoom!

57:15.052 --> 57:18.072
You didn't take it out.
No, I did, the camera broke.

57:18.107 --> 57:21.063
I did it properly...
Cluck! Cluck!Stop doing that.

57:21.098 --> 57:23.985
That's very annoying.
You chicken. No, I wasn't.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.096
I did do a lap, the camera
broke, it just recorded sound.

57:26.131 --> 57:27.997
OK, we've had those clips up

57:28.032 --> 57:31.080
for a week? Yeah. How many
hits did you get? I got...

57:31.115 --> 57:34.005
71.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.021
CHEERING

57:35.056 --> 57:39.021
Are you seriously suggesting

57:39.056 --> 57:42.997
71 people...? Why would
theydo that? Why would

57:43.032 --> 57:47.036
71...? Why are people compelled
toput themselves on it? 71 points.

57:47.071 --> 57:52.032
OK. I got 137. Wow!

57:57.044 --> 57:58.540
Hammond?

57:58.575 --> 57:59.829
Seven.

57:59.864 --> 58:01.049
LAUGHTER

58:01.084 --> 58:02.989
Seven? Seven, yeah.

58:03.024 --> 58:05.044
Seven. That was pathetic.
Thinking back,

58:05.079 --> 58:06.053
I should have misspelled M3

58:06.088 --> 58:09.086
in the tag line bit on
the Internet. What, 3M?

58:09.121 --> 58:12.049
No, if I'd spelled it
"Angelina Jolie topless",

58:12.084 --> 58:16.076
I'd have got more hits than both
of you, but I didn't. Anyway,

58:16.111 --> 58:20.020
we then did an economy run,
from Germany into Poland.

58:20.055 --> 58:23.069
Sadly there isn't time
tonight to show you that.

58:23.104 --> 58:26.084
The upshot was, though,
James ran out of petrol.

58:26.119 --> 58:33.004
Therefore, you get
minus 141.Hang on.

58:33.039 --> 58:35.045
What? I've got minus

58:35.080 --> 58:37.965
exactly what I already had. Yes.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.057
That's the rules - it
happened to him once. It did.

58:41.092 --> 58:45.028
That is the rules. You're minus 141,
so you're currently on... nought.

58:45.063 --> 58:49.045
Er... I get 10 for
that, because I won

58:49.080 --> 58:52.048
in the Ford, thanks to
its two-litre engine,

58:52.083 --> 58:55.008
and you get five for coming second.

58:55.043 --> 58:55.985
Which means,

58:56.020 --> 58:59.040
we have just one final challenge,
something to do with price -

58:59.075 --> 59:00.965
I have it here.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.048
So it's a two-horse race.
Either you or me will win.

59:03.083 --> 59:05.009
He's out. Absolutely.

59:05.044 --> 59:09.060
He is completely out. He's on nought.
OK. So, here we go.

59:09.095 --> 59:12.021
You get one point for every pound

59:12.056 --> 59:15.057
your car was under
the L5,000 budget.

59:15.092 --> 59:21.040
So, hang on, mine cost L3,990,
so I get 1,010 points there!

59:21.075 --> 59:22.973
Look at that.

59:23.008 --> 59:24.037
I like that. Go on then,

59:24.072 --> 59:30.024
how much did yours cost? 4,999.
So you get one point!

59:30.059 --> 59:32.005
Which means, clearly, I win that!

59:32.040 --> 59:34.088
Thank you very much. I may as
wellhave just bought a toy car.

59:34.123 --> 59:37.096
I was going to get the prize.
I would have got...

59:37.131 --> 59:40.064
Those are the rules,
and I win! Thank you!

59:40.099 --> 59:43.064
Delighted. And rightly so. CHEERING

59:43.099 --> 59:44.989
No!

59:45.024 --> 59:48.977
I'm sorry.

59:49.012 --> 59:53.012
If I may just take that from you
and ask you to stand to one side,

59:53.047 --> 59:56.993
because my car was L2,990,

59:57.028 --> 01:00:02.056
meaning I have 2,010 points
straightaway there, which I think

01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:05.016
you will find makes me...

01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:07.053
the winner.

01:00:07.088 --> 01:00:09.021
CHEERING

01:00:09.056 --> 01:00:10.981
That's just silly.

01:00:11.016 --> 01:00:14.024
That's just ridiculous.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.993
Oi! Are we honestly going to say,

01:00:19.028 --> 01:00:21.993
on the world's biggest
motoring show,

01:00:22.028 --> 01:00:25.096
to 350 million people,
that the best track day car

01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:27.577
is a slow, rusty,

01:00:27.612 --> 01:00:29.989
wobbly wheeled,

01:00:30.024 --> 01:00:34.021
small, uneconomical piece of junk?

01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:38.000
Yes. And on that bombshell, it's
time to say goodnight. Goodbye.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:39.052
Oh, this is just ridiculous!
