35:50.107 --> 35:52.526
Yes, now!

36:01.410 --> 36:03.245
OFFICER: Think it's enough?

36:03.412 --> 36:06.248
- Maybe he can't see it.
- Or maybe he's just not coming.

36:06.415 --> 36:08.125
He's coming.

36:11.462 --> 36:13.047
Batman, thank goodness.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.423
All of our tech is down.

36:14.590 --> 36:15.633
Cars, comms...

36:15.800 --> 36:18.636
even our weapons have microchips
coded to our fingerprints.

36:18.928 --> 36:21.013
We're back to the Dark Ages here.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.684
I know. It's a computer virus.
We're trying to hack it now.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.102
That's not the worst of it.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.603
With Grundy sheriff...

36:27.770 --> 36:29.689
He busted you back down to beat cop.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.108
Yeah. His idea of a joke, I'm sure.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.902
I'm lucky the old uniform fits.

36:35.069 --> 36:38.656
Do what you can from the inside.
Keep the peace at all costs.

36:39.156 --> 36:41.409
All right. Anything else?

36:41.575 --> 36:43.786
I'll be in touch.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.669
ALFRED: I'm certain you don't need me
to mention this...

36:51.836 --> 36:55.965
but these gas generators
are only a temporary solution at best.

36:56.132 --> 36:58.217
We've got limited battery power as well.

37:01.971 --> 37:05.474
Would have been nice to have some
solar power, if Gotham ever got any sun.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.893
Doesn't matter. Nothing digital works.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.229
Plus, the clown's put a bounty
on our heads.

37:10.396 --> 37:13.983
You know, if you snap a pic of one of us now,
you get an hour of video games.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.694
- An hour, huh?
- Don't even joke.

37:16.986 --> 37:18.154
NIGHTWING: Joker's got Cyborg.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.115
He controls technology.
Now he's turning Gotham against us.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.534
- How do we fight that?
- We find him.

37:23.701 --> 37:26.537
Great. Why didn't I think of that, Bats?
How?

37:29.832 --> 37:32.793
We get smart,
and do it the old-fashioned way.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.628
Ah, where do we start?

37:34.962 --> 37:38.007
In his original form,
Clayface attracts debris.

37:38.466 --> 37:40.009
Like dust in clay.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.218
Exactly.

37:41.385 --> 37:44.263
Maybe one will inform geography.
Get a sample.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.849
Well, there's plenty on Red Robin.

37:47.725 --> 37:51.520
Nightwing, I've been recording audio
of Joker's dispatches. See if there's clue...

37:51.687 --> 37:53.898
- ...to where he's broadcasting from.
- I'm on it.

37:54.064 --> 37:56.859
Red Robin, I wanna know
why he needed the Inca Rose Gem.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.819
Aye, aye, captain.

38:00.362 --> 38:02.740
Hello again, my subjects.

38:02.907 --> 38:07.745
Your old pal King Joker the First here,
with a very special offer.

38:08.078 --> 38:13.626
I know how much you all love me,
so I'm going to let you throw me a parade.

38:13.793 --> 38:16.754
And the theme is me.

38:16.921 --> 38:22.676
Tomorrow night, I want to see Joker balloons,
Joker costumes, Joker floats.

38:22.843 --> 38:28.849
We're going to show the entire world
how great Jokertown is.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.853
I want results in two hours.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.859
- Arrow?
- Let me say that Clayface...

38:39.026 --> 38:41.403
sucks up more particulates
than a vacuum cleaner.

38:41.570 --> 38:44.240
Other than average dirt and grime,
here's the headline:

38:44.406 --> 38:49.036
Higher-than-average concentration of mineral
salts, mollusk shells and coralline algae.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.830
Mineral salts are sea spray.

38:50.996 --> 38:54.375
Shells and algae are biological components
that make up sand.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.044
That puts them somewhere
on the coastline.

38:57.211 --> 38:58.921
Good. Red Robin?

38:59.713 --> 39:02.800
The Inca Rose Gem is an energy conductor.
He's probably using it...

39:02.967 --> 39:06.720
to boost the transmission signal,
but the source would have to be centralized.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.264
Better. Nightwing?

39:08.430 --> 39:09.557
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

39:09.723 --> 39:12.059
- What is that thing?
- It's called a cell phone.

39:12.226 --> 39:15.104
People used to use it to listen to music
and talk to friends and family.

39:15.271 --> 39:17.606
- Oh, old-school.
- And?

39:17.773 --> 39:22.027
And on every Joker dispatch, there's a slight
reoccurring noise. I've isolated it.

(BELL TOLLING)

39:25.447 --> 39:27.032
What is that? A church bell?

39:27.283 --> 39:28.701
It's a navigational buoy.

39:28.868 --> 39:30.119
They surround the docks.

39:30.286 --> 39:32.955
Okay. This is the Joker's cycle.

39:33.122 --> 39:36.000
I knew the gorilla looked familiar,
I just couldn't place it.

39:36.166 --> 39:42.047

a long time ago that used to be here.

40:03.903 --> 40:06.655

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:42.604
You have to connect the gem
to the Joker's suit.

01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:44.731
The feedback should shut
everything down.

01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:48.193
- CYBORG: Where do I attach this thing?
- GOGO: You need to find the central core.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.238
But attach it to the wrong place,
and it's Jokerworld forever.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.782
Great. No pressure.

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:04.334
Joker's suit is stolen military tech
built by Wayne Industries.

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:06.753
The AI must have found it
when it hacked Gotham.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.048
Cyborg, I'm uploading the specs
to your subnet.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.348
Foul. That's holding.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:20.809
Five-yard penalty.

01:15:25.856 --> 01:15:29.276
Get off me, you metallic bully.

01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:33.363
Here goes everything.

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:40.704
Uh-oh.

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:06.021
(CHATTERING OVER RADIO)

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:11.318
Thanks for nothing, Gordon.

01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:16.364
When we played hide-and-seek,
I let you win.

01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:24.206
I fear it's back
to Arkham for us, my dear.

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:27.375
SILVER BANSHEE (MUFFLED):
Don't you ever stop talking?

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.298
Good night, Gotham City.

01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:35.258
BOY: Quick selfie?

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.011
(CLAYFACE LAUGHING)

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:50.065
Hey, sorry about grabbing you earlier.

01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:51.483
No worries.

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:52.776
Hazard of the job.

01:16:52.943 --> 01:16:55.362
You got an iron grip, though.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:59.074
We combed the bay, no sign of the Joker.

01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:01.701
- He'll be back.
- We'll be here when he is.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:05.163
I can always count on Gotham City
for a thrill.

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:11.545
Ugh, stupid plan.

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.213
Should've worked.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.924
I should be king of the world right now.

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:17.300
Huh?

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.010
(GRUNTING)

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:22.472
Oh, well, better luck next time.

01:17:22.889 --> 01:17:25.016
Maybe I'll open a toy store.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:27.102
Ooh, or a pizza joint.

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:30.730
I could open a restaurant chain.
I could call it Giggles.

01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:32.232
(GUFFAWS)

01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:34.401
I like the sound of that.

01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:36.361
(CHUCKLING)

01:20:07.762 --> 01:20:09.764
