it's really such an honor

Well, we're happy

16:03.830 --> 16:05.365
NED: Thank you.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.834
So, what are our next steps?

16:07.900 --> 16:09.569
Well, sir,
the hearing's this week,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.404
so we'll keep
a low profile.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.973
Don't wanna seem
like we're rushing
things right now.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.408
You good with that?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.644
It makes a bunch of sense
to me. It does.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.279
But I had a thought.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.681
Maybe we keep
to the schedule.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.117
I grew up down the road,
and this is a small town.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.753
There's been a tragedy here,
and people need time to mourn.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.521
They don't need bad news
on top of bad news.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.957
What these people need
isn't time to mourn, Ned.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.093
It's jobs.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.628
Am I making any sense?
If not, you just tell me
to shut up. (CHUCKLES)

So I spoke to
the Governor's office.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.333
They are behind us 100%.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.502
They want Shay
Mountain mined.
But?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.304
But they won't get
the state police involved,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.606
so we'll have to work
with the locals for now.

it's an election year.

on the other hand,

17:03.923 --> 17:05.558
Farrells are part of

18:04.651 --> 18:06.486

sent back down there?

18:08.155 --> 18:09.689

I wanted to mention.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.006
Mmm, I heard, Sheriff,
(SNIFFLES)

18:27.073 --> 18:30.677
that our colleague's son
was sold some Moonshine
from the Farrell clan.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.646

was number two in his class?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.815

I think they called it.

Oh, no. Of course not.

you might wanna know

something else in that jug?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.711
