WEBVTT

00:03.606 --> 00:04.767
Hey JD!

00:04.867 --> 00:07.067
You keep wheeling them in,
I keep wheeling them out.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.189
Awesome! Appropriateness Doug.

00:09.289 --> 00:11.744
Carol. We’re ready for
our sponge bath.

00:12.019 --> 00:13.587
Thank you, Carol.

00:14.566 --> 00:17.821
Hey. Why was your baby boy dress
like ceasar, this morning?

00:17.921 --> 00:20.180
I don't have clothe
for Sam in my house,

00:20.280 --> 00:22.592
so I just cut arm and
leg holes in a pillow case

00:22.692 --> 00:24.799
The gold belt was just so
he wouldn’t feel ridiculous.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.889
JD, you’re a parent now,
you gotta be better prepared.

00:27.989 --> 00:31.961
Yeah. That’s why we just stocked up
on extra baby oil lotion and diapers

00:32.061 --> 00:33.873
Why? Is there a party this week-end?

00:36.281 --> 00:38.323
Recently
we realized that with todd,

00:38.423 --> 00:40.538
if we didn't move
and stayed very quiet,

00:40.638 --> 00:42.917
he'd eventually
get confused and leave.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.745
Anyway.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.323
Much like one-hit wonder
natalie imbruglia, I'm torn.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.147
You see, on one hand, I'm
tempted to side with the gandhis.

00:51.247 --> 00:53.244
You do need to buy
sam some clothes.

00:53.344 --> 00:56.359
On the other hand, ever
since you two made a baby,

00:56.459 --> 00:59.583
you've become an even more
annoying 2-headed know-it-all.

01:00.965 --> 01:02.220
You hear that, perry?

01:02.320 --> 01:04.974
That's the sound of your hate
bouncing off our love.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.105
Attention, dumb-dumbs.

01:09.205 --> 01:10.831
Many of you have been disregarding

01:10.931 --> 01:13.042
the hospital's
12-hour shift policy.

01:13.142 --> 01:16.098
Now, I don't care if you think
your patients need you,

01:16.198 --> 01:18.849
when your shift is over,
I want you to go home

01:18.949 --> 01:21.176
to your sad, empty lives.

01:21.374 --> 01:23.094
Tired doctors make mistakes,

01:23.194 --> 01:25.207
and the hospital is liable.

01:25.407 --> 01:28.697
Believe me, you do not want to
find yourself in a court of law.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.700
Tell them what happens there, ted.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.761
Well, the law wear long black robes

01:34.861 --> 01:38.029
and beautiful white curly wigs.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.411
- That's england, ted.
- Are you sure?

01:40.511 --> 01:42.783
Anyway, from now on,

01:42.883 --> 01:44.997
anyone caught working
after their shift is over

01:45.097 --> 01:48.447
will be sent home immediately
and docked a full day's pay.

01:48.547 --> 01:49.649
Ciao.

01:51.284 --> 01:54.283
Well, marian, your hepatitis
test came back negative.

01:54.383 --> 01:56.747
- That's good, right?
- Yes and no.

01:56.847 --> 01:58.623
I still don't know
what's wrong with you.

01:58.723 --> 02:01.536
Well, you'll figure it out.
You're a good doctor.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.801
Will do.

02:05.229 --> 02:06.644
Hey, I'm going to lunch.

02:06.744 --> 02:08.597
I took her culture
to the lab for you.

02:08.697 --> 02:10.570
- Thanks, keith.
- Yeah.

02:12.015 --> 02:13.890
Sounds like he's finally over you.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.532
No, he's still alternating
between angry name calling

02:16.632 --> 02:18.521
and whiny pleas
to get back together.

02:18.621 --> 02:20.535
Although he did agree to be civil

02:20.635 --> 02:22.423
while he's inside the hospital.

02:22.523 --> 02:23.522
Hello?

02:23.770 --> 02:26.587
Why won't you love me?!

02:27.381 --> 02:29.935
- Why don't you...
- See you tomorrow, keith.

02:30.170 --> 02:32.801
Can you believe a month ago
you were gonna marry him

02:32.901 --> 02:34.487
and I was gonna move in with kim,

02:34.587 --> 02:37.072
and it all fell apart
when we had that almost-moment

02:37.172 --> 02:38.649
in the on-call room?

02:39.099 --> 02:40.912
You know, we never
talked about that.

02:41.029 --> 02:43.379
What's there to talk about?
You just tried to kiss me.

02:44.177 --> 02:46.618
I tried to kiss her? What the hell?

02:46.911 --> 02:48.148
Wait a second,

02:48.248 --> 02:51.399
there's nobody here to see
my "what the hell?" Face.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.385
What is it? And make it
quick so you don't bore me.

02:55.485 --> 02:58.143
A few months ago elliot and I almost
kissed, but now she's saying...

02:58.243 --> 02:59.553
Well, you tried
your best. Now leave me alone.

02:59.653 --> 03:01.319
Slagy, you're up.

03:01.419 --> 03:03.430
A genetic defect that
presents with anemia

03:03.530 --> 03:06.500
and causes copper build up in the liver
and other organs, destroying them.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.131
What is wilson's disease?

03:09.231 --> 03:10.129
Yes.

03:10.229 --> 03:13.107
Yes! In your face, in your face

03:13.207 --> 03:15.258
what annoying thing
is happening now?

03:15.435 --> 03:17.776
They're playing diagnosis jeopardy.

03:17.876 --> 03:19.681
When you win, you get
to gloat. It's so stupid.

03:19.781 --> 03:21.433
You never got to gloat, did you?

03:21.533 --> 03:23.968
I don't believe in gloating,
it's tacky.

03:24.068 --> 03:26.965
"A condition in which the patient
speaks in previously unknown dialect

03:27.065 --> 03:28.814
due to severe brain trauma."

03:28.914 --> 03:30.385
What is foreign accent syndrome?!

03:30.485 --> 03:33.088
Yes! In your faces!
Or should I say...

03:33.188 --> 03:35.006
In your faces.

03:35.106 --> 03:36.956
Hello, governor.

03:37.056 --> 03:40.308
Throw another shrimp
on the barbie for me.

03:40.408 --> 03:43.052
- Wait, that's irish.
- You're an idiot.

03:43.152 --> 03:45.352
Now I have to go start work,

03:45.452 --> 03:48.936
because in spite of all of you,
i'm going to have a great day.

03:50.437 --> 03:52.588
That was the worst day
I've ever had.

03:52.688 --> 03:54.736
- Daddy's home!
- Come here, jacky boy.

03:54.836 --> 03:57.035
Give me a big kiss.
I love you. Good night.

03:57.135 --> 03:59.249
Where the hell are you going?
It's your night to tell him a story.

03:59.349 --> 04:01.583
Oh, no, no, no. I  couldn't be
more wiped out.

04:01.683 --> 04:02.921
The nanny's mom died,

04:03.021 --> 04:04.747
and I had to spend the whole
day sprinting around the house

04:04.847 --> 04:06.616
trying to avoid having
conversations with her.

04:06.716 --> 04:09.298
You don't see me crying about it.
So suck it up and spin a yarn.

04:09.398 --> 04:11.281
Yeah, dad, suck it up.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.088
Ok, jacky.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.593
Will do.

04:17.906 --> 04:21.445
There was once a nurse, a surgeon,

04:21.545 --> 04:23.938
a doctor, and an idiot.

04:24.038 --> 04:26.369
Does this hat make me look fly?

04:26.469 --> 04:29.342
Perry, he's 4. No hospital stories.

04:29.442 --> 04:30.748
Fine.

04:31.027 --> 04:34.308
There was once a 2-headed witch,

04:35.107 --> 04:39.138
a princess, and a village idiot.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.500
Does this hat make me look fly-ith?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.690
It jingles when I shake it.

For The High-Five Team and SeriesSub.com

04:58.466 --> 05:00.777
- N there?
- yep.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.746
Ok, here we go.

05:02.985 --> 05:06.734
Once upon a time, a long time ago,

05:06.834 --> 05:10.564
there was a little village
known as sacred heartia.

05:13.551 --> 05:15.345
Dammit, giant.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.601
Why is this village so filthy?

05:17.701 --> 05:19.641
Well, irritable
towns woman of color,

05:19.741 --> 05:22.645
it could be because this
town's roads are paved with mud.

05:22.745 --> 05:25.845
Or maybe it's because I've been swabbing
everyone's porch with ox urine.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.817
I jest. Only yours.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.214
You know why? You've been
telling people I eat babies.

05:31.314 --> 05:34.713
I don't eat babies. With babies,
it's a minute on the lips,

05:34.813 --> 05:37.646
a lifetime on the hips.
I eat toddlers.

05:37.746 --> 05:39.697
I thought you said
she'd be dead already.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.983
Come back later. Say,
do you have any babies...

05:43.083 --> 05:45.385
Toddlers on that cart?

05:46.778 --> 05:48.829
- Nope.
- Well, off to work.

05:48.941 --> 05:50.753
On the outskirts of town,

05:50.853 --> 05:53.935
the princess' handmaiden
was in dire straights,

05:54.035 --> 05:57.010
so her highness sent out
a call for help.

05:57.110 --> 05:59.137
- Good morrow.
- That's funny.

05:59.237 --> 06:00.980
I requested someone
strong and brave,

06:01.080 --> 06:02.898
and yet here stands
the village idiot.

06:02.998 --> 06:05.966
Hey, I'm brave. I just saved this
fish from drowning.

06:06.679 --> 06:08.671
Off you go, little buddy.

06:09.761 --> 06:11.175
He's tired now.

06:11.278 --> 06:13.665
Earlier he was dancing all around.

06:14.321 --> 06:17.394
- Run free! Run!
- now, this was no ordinary idiot.

06:17.494 --> 06:19.705
- He was a colossal idiot.
- Run free! Andale!

06:19.805 --> 06:23.037
I mean such an idiot
that other idiots would...

06:23.137 --> 06:24.962
- daddy!
- I'm very sorry, dear.

06:25.062 --> 06:27.205
I just wanted to be
real clear with you

06:27.305 --> 06:29.372
about how big an idiot
he actually was.

06:29.478 --> 06:32.372
In any case, the princess and the idiot

06:32.472 --> 06:34.490
had had a sorted past.

06:34.590 --> 06:35.710
Look, your highness,

06:35.810 --> 06:38.303
I just came by so you could apologize
for saying I tried to kiss you

06:38.403 --> 06:40.343
when in fact, it was
your royal tongue

06:40.443 --> 06:42.377
that tried to storm
my mouth castle.

06:42.477 --> 06:44.302
That's not how I recall it.

06:44.402 --> 06:46.161
Come on, you closed your eyes

06:46.261 --> 06:48.973
and started heaving
your bosoms up and down

06:49.073 --> 06:52.058
- and up and down.
- Yeah, that's called breathing.

06:52.158 --> 06:53.722
I'm doing it now.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.919
I know. Can I rest my face on them

06:56.019 --> 06:58.487
- and ponder what you've said?
- No.

06:58.587 --> 07:00.992
My poor maiden is being
tormented by a terrible monster.

07:01.092 --> 07:03.031
She grows weaker by the minute.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.484
A monster?

07:04.584 --> 07:06.062
I mean, she looks ill,

07:06.162 --> 07:09.245
but I think it's a bit of a leap
to say it's the work of a monster.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.771
There's a monster in there.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.489
J.d., she's febrile,
her liver's enlarged,

07:22.589 --> 07:23.734
and her kidney's are shutting down.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.372
Are you gonna help me, or not?

07:25.472 --> 07:26.574
I will.

07:28.034 --> 07:29.362
Keith.

07:31.479 --> 07:34.030
Perhaps if I can save your maiden,

07:34.130 --> 07:35.844
the soul of your heart will soften

07:35.944 --> 07:38.860
so I can once again plant
the seed of our love.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.137
Yeah, look, prince,
this, it's not happening, ok?

07:42.237 --> 07:44.223
Time to move on.
Now, if you don't mind,

07:44.323 --> 07:46.399
i'd like to get back
the key to my chastity belt.

07:46.499 --> 07:47.856
Fine.

07:50.684 --> 07:52.320
Come on, peppermint.

07:57.405 --> 08:00.405
That is going to make
so many things so much easier.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.451
Why'd you send him away?
We could have used his help.

08:07.408 --> 08:09.792
- We... Help... Highness.
- Can... Your...

08:09.892 --> 08:11.978
the turla
was once 2 separate witches.

08:12.078 --> 08:15.113
But when they married,
they merged into one.

08:15.213 --> 08:17.436
It made for some
awkward situations.

08:17.536 --> 08:19.443
That's... I'm... What... Talking...

08:19.543 --> 08:20.949
About.

08:21.677 --> 08:24.332
Turla, how can we
defeat the monster?

08:24.432 --> 08:26.976
We... Go... The... Must... To...

08:27.076 --> 08:29.395
- Delicatessen.
- What?

08:29.495 --> 08:31.850
I knew they just did that
alternating words thing to bug me.

08:31.950 --> 08:33.500
Now, meet us at the potion shop

08:33.600 --> 08:35.812
so we can get a spell
to stop that monster.

08:35.912 --> 08:37.943
But first we must
stop at the drug store.

08:38.044 --> 08:40.230
I need to pick up something
for her time of the month.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.958
It's our time of the month.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.679
Is that why I keep
crying for no damn reason?

08:43.780 --> 08:45.266
'cause I didn't ask for this.

08:45.366 --> 08:46.619
Do we look fat?

08:46.719 --> 08:48.101
We look beautiful, baby.

08:48.201 --> 08:49.713
- You sure?
- We do.

08:49.970 --> 08:51.517
How are we gonna get there?

08:51.617 --> 08:53.880
Don't worry, I got a sweet ride.

08:57.061 --> 08:58.780
This is mortifying.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.795
Don't listen to her, sasha.

09:00.895 --> 09:02.920
Idiot, I have to ask.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.619
How do you get your hair like that?

09:04.719 --> 09:06.667
You like it? I do it myself.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.804
It's one part horse manure,
one part river mud,

09:09.904 --> 09:12.202
and a touch of
my special ingredient.

09:15.218 --> 09:17.147
It's the dark lord's toadie.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.209
My master approaches.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.780
Prepare yourselves for
his untamed vengeance.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.748
The dark lord oslek

09:25.848 --> 09:28.402
was the evil ruler
of the entire land.

09:28.502 --> 09:29.998
Hey, gang, how you holding up?

09:30.098 --> 09:32.285
That is a sharp-looking donkey.

09:32.385 --> 09:33.460
Told you.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.332
No speaking!

09:35.539 --> 09:37.223
A warning to all,

09:37.323 --> 09:39.990
any who dare step foot
in my forbidden forest

09:40.090 --> 09:42.750
shall fall and disappear.

09:42.962 --> 09:45.971
I was in the forbidden
forest earlier today and I'm still here.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.034
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

09:49.134 --> 09:50.501
What? Where?

09:53.214 --> 09:56.028
Murphy's shift ended
20 minutes ago,

09:56.128 --> 09:58.763
and he was still here. So now
he's going home without pay.

09:58.863 --> 10:01.389
If anyone would like
to join him, test me.

10:01.489 --> 10:03.473
I should at least take
that body downstairs.

10:05.956 --> 10:07.702
I said out!

10:08.469 --> 10:10.104
Take care of that.

10:15.609 --> 10:17.404
Aw, man.

10:18.265 --> 10:20.097
There goes my back.

10:21.963 --> 10:24.565
Where you guys able to get
that c-diff test I ordered?

10:24.665 --> 10:26.207
Lab's all backed up.

10:26.307 --> 10:27.910
We need those results now.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.754
I'll handle this.

10:29.854 --> 10:31.058
I'll stay here.

10:31.158 --> 10:33.283
God help me, I wish you could.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.483
We need a monster-fighting potion.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.149
Sorry, this customer here is next.

10:42.748 --> 10:44.520
What the hell are you?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.387
I'm the fairy todd something.

10:46.487 --> 10:48.751
Well, step aside,
lest you be dealt with.

10:48.851 --> 10:50.371
Turk, wand.

10:50.605 --> 10:52.502
Yeah, um, about the wand,

10:52.602 --> 10:54.544
I may have let the idiot borrow it.

10:57.111 --> 10:58.737
Aw, man.

11:00.401 --> 11:02.748
You know, I have a big
wand if you want to hold it.

11:02.848 --> 11:04.931
Of course, when it comes
to magic, I just do this.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.709
Fairy five.

11:08.809 --> 11:10.099
Turk, no.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.437
You don't let us go first,

11:11.537 --> 11:13.299
i'll never let him
high five you again.

11:13.399 --> 11:14.705
After you.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.647
Still can high five five?

11:17.747 --> 11:18.834
Comin' at ya.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.796
I love slapping people five.

11:24.762 --> 11:26.391
Your shoelace is untied.

11:26.491 --> 11:28.126
Hey, thanks, man.

11:28.226 --> 11:29.793
You know how dangerous this is?

11:29.893 --> 11:32.550
My uncle's whole family
was killed by an untied lace.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.126
Christmas morning, they were
all running down the stairs,

11:34.226 --> 11:36.981
they tripped, and a mad man
hacked them all to pieces.

11:37.081 --> 11:39.857
- I owe you one.
- Can't wait.

11:40.145 --> 11:42.075
Guess who got the lab results.

11:42.175 --> 11:43.675
Oh, you guys are amazing.

11:45.176 --> 11:47.376
Damn, the c-diff is negative.

11:47.476 --> 11:49.127
She's getting worse,

11:49.227 --> 11:51.316
and we're not any closer
to figuring out why.

11:51.651 --> 11:53.373
I got to page him.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.348
And now we wait.

12:03.448 --> 12:05.162
Hey, can you get rid of this tail?

12:05.262 --> 12:06.858
No problem, buddy.

12:07.448 --> 12:10.065
- I meant with magic.
- He's here.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.520
And then before them

12:12.620 --> 12:15.983
appeared the bravest,
most handsome knight

12:16.083 --> 12:19.113
that any of them had ever seen.

12:22.013 --> 12:23.317
Princess.

12:24.896 --> 12:26.297
Princess.

12:28.076 --> 12:29.564
Brave knight,

12:29.707 --> 12:33.063
my poor maiden is being held captive
by a monster that can't be beaten.

12:33.163 --> 12:36.134
There is no such thing
as a monster that can't be beaten.

12:36.234 --> 12:38.244
Hey, you. Hang on to that.

12:43.092 --> 12:45.194
You know, I Miss hanging out with you.

12:45.294 --> 12:46.829
Like, alone.

12:46.929 --> 12:48.676
There's not much I can do.

12:48.776 --> 12:50.760
Last night I had some grog with a guy

12:50.860 --> 12:52.702
whe hutmate is a barrel maker.

12:52.802 --> 12:54.886
Let's just say the guy has a saw.

12:54.986 --> 12:57.145
Be careful, or I'll make
your chin disappear.

12:57.245 --> 13:00.088
- Oh, too late.
- That's not nice.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.689
Look, the battle has begun.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.298
My name is percible cox.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.107
You're killing my friend.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.713
Prepare to die.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.074

13:21.989 --> 13:23.457
Well, that's new.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.534
I don't know what's scarier,

13:25.634 --> 13:27.589
the monster or that scary old lady.

13:27.689 --> 13:29.142
What scary old lady?

13:31.358 --> 13:32.821
Very funny.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.542
Perry, it's his bedtime.

13:34.642 --> 13:36.274
- But, jordan.
- But, mom.

13:36.374 --> 13:38.643
No buts. Lights out.

13:41.906 --> 13:43.049
Jacky.

13:43.184 --> 13:45.297
Would you like to hear
the rest of the story?

13:45.397 --> 13:46.398
Yeah.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.470
Let's see, where was i?

13:49.763 --> 13:52.197
Oh, I remember.
Scoot up for a second.

13:52.297 --> 13:54.165
Give me some sugar. All right.

13:54.279 --> 13:56.934
The knight was getting
his ass kicked.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.409
That's new.

14:15.006 --> 14:17.588
What's the monster like?
Is he nice?

14:19.708 --> 14:22.817
That monster cannot be
slain by sword alone.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.620
Baby, maybe you can
lull the monster to sleep

14:24.720 --> 14:27.368
by telling him one of them boring-ass
stories about your family.

14:27.702 --> 14:28.870
That's it.

14:29.637 --> 14:32.403
Are you out your mind, woman?
We only got one ball.

14:32.503 --> 14:33.642
You were saying?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.014
The only way to save
your fair maiden

14:35.114 --> 14:37.069
is to go to the forbidden forest

14:37.169 --> 14:38.981
and find the golden ring.

14:39.081 --> 14:40.980
The golden ring? Why?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.732
Because finding the diagnosis

14:42.832 --> 14:44.725
is the only way to help her.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.133
Right now you're just
treating symptoms

14:46.233 --> 14:47.805
that are leading you
down the wrong road.

14:47.905 --> 14:49.604
You need to go
back to the beginning,

14:49.704 --> 14:52.412
back to every textbook, every
case study you ever read.

14:52.512 --> 14:55.741
And most importantly,
to find the golden ring,

14:55.841 --> 14:57.877
you must rember what you heard

14:57.977 --> 14:59.883
when you weren't even listening.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.821
Remember what you heard when
you weren't even listening.

15:02.921 --> 15:04.037
What the hell does that mean?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.836
I don't know, but I can't
find anything in here

15:05.936 --> 15:07.693
to her kidney malfunction,
her lack of clotting,

15:07.793 --> 15:09.379
and the internal bleeding.

15:09.479 --> 15:12.320
I feel like we're just getting
lost deeper in the woods.

15:16.544 --> 15:19.672
- Your ass is bleeding.
- Sasha, are you ok?

15:19.772 --> 15:23.110
- No, idiot, your ass is bleeding.
- I know, my tail was ripped off.

15:23.210 --> 15:26.103
If it doesn't scab over,
my soul will leak out.

15:26.495 --> 15:29.076
Why you looking at
my ass, anyway, princess?

15:29.176 --> 15:31.778
Missing what you could have had
when you tried to kiss me earlier?

15:31.878 --> 15:33.571
Good morrow!

15:35.715 --> 15:37.473
Idiot, princess,

15:37.573 --> 15:39.315
you shouldn't be
in the forbidden forest.

15:39.415 --> 15:41.571
The dark lord is near. Hide!

15:41.671 --> 15:43.083
Come on, sasha.

15:51.426 --> 15:52.800
They're gone.

15:53.991 --> 15:55.344
Thanks.

15:55.725 --> 15:58.188
Our shifts ended a half hour ago.
We would have been screwed.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.934
Well, this counts as
the one I owe you.

16:00.034 --> 16:02.297
- Fine, we're even.
- Excellent.

16:09.443 --> 16:11.568
I'm going to miss those two.

16:11.668 --> 16:13.838
They never once spit on me.

16:13.938 --> 16:15.724
You seem like a nice enough guy.

16:15.824 --> 16:17.803
Why you still working
for lord oslek?

16:17.903 --> 16:21.624
I tell most people it's
because I'm under an evil spell,

16:21.724 --> 16:24.902
but really it's
a self-confidence thing.

16:25.002 --> 16:26.407
Yeah, I get that.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.022
Say, you want to go
hollow out some villagers

16:28.122 --> 16:30.433
- and use them as kites?
- Do i?

16:42.636 --> 16:44.799
I can't believe
i'm going to die with you.

16:44.899 --> 16:46.821
Who said anything about dying?

16:46.921 --> 16:48.926
It's probably just
some harmless torture.

16:49.026 --> 16:51.382
He's right, it's not that bad.

16:52.096 --> 16:54.874
Since we meet
our fate together, I should tell you,

16:54.974 --> 16:57.525
'twas I that tried to kiss you.

16:57.921 --> 16:59.306
No, milady.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.390
We tried to kiss each other.

17:02.211 --> 17:05.223
I know we were both
running away from things, but

17:05.444 --> 17:08.079
do you think that
near-kiss meant anything?

17:08.835 --> 17:10.827
There's only one way to find out.

17:17.739 --> 17:20.025
- Almost there. Ok.
- Can you...

17:20.125 --> 17:21.489
Little bit of tongue, maybe.

17:21.846 --> 17:25.080
Your time has come.

17:26.790 --> 17:29.867
- You're both suspended.
- You can't do that.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.003
This is my hospital,
I can do whatever I want.

17:33.842 --> 17:35.340
Get it?

17:35.498 --> 17:38.376
Sir, you can't suspend me.
I'm private practice.

17:38.476 --> 17:40.164
And I've had zero
patient interaction,

17:40.264 --> 17:42.206
so there's no liability issue.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.894
So this can't come back to me?

17:44.994 --> 17:46.082
- No.
- No.

17:46.182 --> 17:47.464
Then get out.

17:54.057 --> 17:55.877
A dab of manure.

17:58.418 --> 18:00.483
Now, where were we in that dungeon?

18:00.583 --> 18:01.791
Focus.

18:01.891 --> 18:03.608
We have to save my maiden.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.735
But how are we supposed to
find a golden ring in an endless forest?

18:06.835 --> 18:10.306
Remember what you heard when
you weren't even listening.

18:11.226 --> 18:13.167
Am imagining him?

18:13.267 --> 18:14.603
Imaging who?

18:14.703 --> 18:16.625
Asked and answered.

18:16.725 --> 18:18.888
Hey, idiot. Down here.

18:19.668 --> 18:21.156
What's up, bro?

18:22.483 --> 18:24.130
What lives?

18:24.643 --> 18:26.511
I just remembered something.

18:27.235 --> 18:29.548
I was barely listening.

18:29.881 --> 18:31.947
A genetic defect that
presents with anemia

18:32.047 --> 18:34.347
and causes copper build up
in the liver and other organs,

18:34.447 --> 18:37.205
- destroying them.
- What is wilson's disease?

18:38.757 --> 18:40.788
It's wilson's disease.

18:42.307 --> 18:43.930
This is for you.

18:50.886 --> 18:52.618
The golden ring.

18:52.718 --> 18:54.651
We must make haste
back to the maiden.

18:54.751 --> 18:56.328
To sasha!

18:57.290 --> 18:58.519
We're doomed.

18:58.619 --> 19:00.930
It's ok, I still have turla's wand.

19:03.471 --> 19:05.549
What in the hell is going on?

19:05.652 --> 19:07.563
Oops. Let me try that again.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.878
Now that's more like it. Hold this.

19:25.424 --> 19:27.883
Hang on, maiden! We're here!

19:48.478 --> 19:50.678
How do we know for sure
it's wilson's disease?

19:50.778 --> 19:53.583
She'll have copper deposits
around her iris.

19:53.683 --> 19:55.561
What does it look like?

19:55.876 --> 20:00.007
A little... golden... ring.

20:06.611 --> 20:08.639
That's a great diagnosis.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.318
What are her chances?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.289
We've done all we can.

20:12.389 --> 20:14.060
Now she needs
a new liver, we just...

20:14.160 --> 20:16.285
Got to hope she gets one on time.

20:18.348 --> 20:20.511
And with the monster gone,

20:20.611 --> 20:23.791
all was once again well
in sacred heartia.

20:23.891 --> 20:26.127
The turla made peace with itself.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.185
Beautiful kites were flown.

20:30.285 --> 20:31.676
Yeah!

20:31.776 --> 20:34.486
And the knight rode off
to fight again.

20:36.394 --> 20:38.693
And the idiot and the princess?

20:38.793 --> 20:42.873
Well, they decided that their
almost-kiss meant nothing.

20:46.487 --> 20:48.233
Because in the end,

20:48.754 --> 20:50.660
they were both idiots.

20:50.793 --> 20:52.748
What about the maiden?

20:52.915 --> 20:54.686
What do you think, jack?

20:54.864 --> 20:57.069
She lived happily ever after.

21:00.939 --> 21:03.459
Go to sleep. I love you very much.

21:06.452 --> 21:07.553
So...

21:10.656 --> 21:11.909
So what?

21:12.009 --> 21:13.431
So did the girl make it?

21:13.531 --> 21:14.758
Did she get her liver in time?

21:14.858 --> 21:16.750
Is that how it really ended?

21:17.437 --> 21:19.072
Let's just say...

21:21.059 --> 21:22.977
That's the way i'm telling it.
