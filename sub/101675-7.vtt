00:02.132 --> 00:05.005
Previously onYoung Sheldon...Which bowtie says "mature enough

00:05.048 --> 00:06.702
"to be in college,
but whimsical enough

00:06.745 --> 00:08.269
"to discuss which came first,

00:08.312 --> 00:10.053
the Higgs field or the photon"?

00:10.097 --> 00:12.142
They both say "weird
kid who eats alone."

00:12.186 --> 00:14.753
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.
This is Mary Cooper.

00:14.797 --> 00:18.409
Did you know there's a, uh,
supercollider being built

00:18.453 --> 00:20.890
in Waxahachie, Texas?No.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.066
I've taken a job there.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.069
Hold on.
You're not gonna be around

00:26.113 --> 00:27.375
when Sheldon starts college?

00:27.418 --> 00:29.551
That's a great question.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.074
No.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.599
JEFF:
Since everyone

00:34.643 --> 00:36.645
is going back to school
tomorrow, let's finish up

00:36.688 --> 00:39.909
with a back-to-school prayer.
What?

00:39.952 --> 00:41.693
Does this prayer just
apply to middle school,

00:41.737 --> 00:44.305
or is it appropriate
for the college-bound?

00:44.348 --> 00:45.697
It's for everyone.

00:45.741 --> 00:48.091
But thank you once again
for reminding us

00:48.135 --> 00:49.397
you're starting college.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.834
Oh, I don't mind. You've
got a lot on your plate.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.488
Just pray.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.839
ALL:
Dear Heavenly Father,
as we return to school,

00:56.882 --> 00:58.101
we look to your eternal...

00:58.145 --> 00:59.102
Billy, it's not the pledge.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.716
It is clear that we cannot
expect the cooperation...[phone ringing]

01:04.760 --> 01:08.938
Normally I don't like facial
hair, but Spock makes it work.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.374
Hello?Sheldon,

01:10.418 --> 01:12.333
it's Dr. Linkletter.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.465
I'm watching Star Trek:
The Original Series.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.294
I'm sorry, I'm not up
on my cartoons.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.122
It's not a cartoon.
It's a live-action

01:19.166 --> 01:20.515
science fiction show.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.299
Although there is one called
Star Trek:

01:22.343 --> 01:23.648
The Animated Series.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.215
I believe you.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.609
I was wondering if I can
speak with your mommy.

01:27.652 --> 01:28.740
Sure. Hold on.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.308
Mom, Dr. Linkletter's
on the phone.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.527
While we wait,
here's a fun fact.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.311
In the animated series,

01:34.355 --> 01:36.139
Kukulkan was played by
James Doohan.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.446
Hello?James Doohan played Scotty

01:38.489 --> 01:39.838
on Star Trek:
The Original Series.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.623
Sheldon, I've got it.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.234
He tried several accents before
settling on Scottish.

01:44.278 --> 01:47.019
MARY: Sheldon, hang up.SHELDON: Okay.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.544
He felt the Scots were
excellent engineers. Bye.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.459
Dr. Linkletter,

01:51.502 --> 01:52.895
what can I do for you?

01:52.938 --> 01:55.158
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.
I just wanted to let you know,

01:55.202 --> 01:57.421
with Dr. Sturgis away,
I'll be available

01:57.465 --> 01:59.554
should Sheldon need anything.

01:59.597 --> 02:03.906
Oh, that is very comforting
to know. Thank you so much.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.430
His well-being is important
to me,

02:06.474 --> 02:09.216
as was made abundantly clear
by my boss.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.871
Okay, well, we are truly
grateful.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.570
Now, I'm not terribly
experienced around children.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.659
If he needs to use the restroom,
I don't have to

02:17.702 --> 02:19.878
go in with him, do I?

02:19.922 --> 02:22.446
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:22.490 --> 02:25.449
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

02:25.493 --> 02:28.670
♪ I bet I could be your hero

02:28.713 --> 02:30.585

02:30.628 --> 02:35.198
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

02:39.420 --> 02:41.248
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive,

02:41.291 --> 02:42.945
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.512
And with school
starting tomorrow,

02:44.555 --> 02:46.340
please watch over
our children.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.906
Pastor Jeff already
covered this.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.995
He did?Yeah, we're good. Amen.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.389
ALL:
Amen.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.782
Can I take your truck tomorrow?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.871
Well, I think you're
riding with me.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.352
Sorry, I'm taking
Missy to school,

02:58.395 --> 03:00.528
and Meemaw's
taking Sheldon.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.052
Well, can I at least drive?Sure.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.749
While you hide in the back
under a tarp?

03:04.793 --> 03:07.622
Stop praying for him
and focus on the other two.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.755
Sheldon, good news.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.409
Dr. Linkletter was
calling to say

03:12.453 --> 03:15.456
that while you're at school,
if you need anything,

03:15.499 --> 03:16.805
you can go to him.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.546
Starting college and
you need a babysitter.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.634
That's funny.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.679
I don't need a babysitter.

03:21.723 --> 03:25.901
Dr. Linkletter is just around
in case there's a problem.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.903
Like if he needs
a new diaper?
Ha!

03:27.946 --> 03:30.601
Enough.
Can we please have
a nice dinner?

03:30.645 --> 03:33.996
We could. But you're the one
who wants to eat as a family.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.564
Don't pray for any of 'em.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.088
[knock on door]

03:39.131 --> 03:41.656
Dr. Linkletter.
Sheldon.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.571
How wonderfully early it is
to see you.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.051
If you've come by for a snack,
I picked you up

03:46.095 --> 03:47.749
some crackers shaped like fish.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.577
I just wanted to let you know

03:49.620 --> 03:51.187
that I don't need you
to babysit me.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.797
I'm perfectly self-reliant.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.452
Excellent. I'm not very
comfortable around children,

03:55.496 --> 03:57.149
even with your level
of maturity.

03:57.193 --> 03:58.934
How old are you?
Six? Seven?

03:58.977 --> 03:59.891
Eleven.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.545
I see.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.330
Then it's good I kept
the receipt for this

04:03.373 --> 04:06.246
bottle of bubbles
shaped like a bear.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.856
I should get going.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.337
My philosophy class starts
in a few minutes.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.601
Ah, yes, the great thinkers.
Socrates, Plato.

04:13.644 --> 04:17.605
Speaking of which,
I got you some Play-Doh.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.612
I figure you don't
want me to walk you in?

04:24.655 --> 04:26.178
I've trained you well.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.007
Do you have everything
you need? Lunch money?

04:29.051 --> 04:30.748
Yep.
Locker combination?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.533
Right here.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.318
Why is it there?Writing on my hand
is so fifth grade.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
Of course.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.148
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.716
I assume you don't
want a hug?

04:41.759 --> 04:43.544
Make it quick.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.982
That's enough.Okay.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.116
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.514
♪

05:06.131 --> 05:07.655
Hey.

05:07.698 --> 05:08.917
Hey, Brenda.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.310
She didn't want you
to walk her in?

05:10.353 --> 05:12.050
No. How about Billy?

05:12.094 --> 05:13.182
Oh, I walked him in.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.357
Found his homeroom.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
Explained that "homeroom"
is different

05:16.098 --> 05:17.795
than his room at home.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.406
Still not sure he gets it.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.408
Tough day.Yeah.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.366
You want to get some coffee?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.717
I was thinking vodka,
but coffee will do.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.420
ADULT SHELDON:
I've always considered myself
a collector of knowledge.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.379
My mind is like the warehouse
at the end of

05:36.423 --> 05:38.642
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.906
But instead of artifacts,
it's just facts. [chuckles]

05:41.950 --> 05:44.474
And now that I was
a full-time college student,

05:44.518 --> 05:47.695
my collection was about to
grow exponentially.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.350
ERICSON:
Welcome to the world
of philosophy.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.744
Most college courses are about
teaching you things

05:53.788 --> 05:55.659
that you don't know. Here,

05:55.703 --> 05:59.010
I am going to teach you
that you don't even know

05:59.054 --> 06:01.273
what you think you know.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.318
Oh, boy.

06:09.412 --> 06:12.110
The Chinese philosopher
Chuang Tzu believed

06:12.154 --> 06:14.939
it was possible he didn't
really know anything

06:14.983 --> 06:16.376
because he might just be
a butterfly

06:16.419 --> 06:20.380
dreaming that he was
a philosopher.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.511
He wasn't a butterfly.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.426
Well, how do you know?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.385
The butterfly brain
doesn't contain enough neurons

06:25.428 --> 06:28.170
to generate a complex dream.
Plus, you referred to him

06:28.213 --> 06:29.301
as Chinese philosopher
Chuang Tzu,

06:29.345 --> 06:31.565
and not Chinese butterfly
Chuang Tzu.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.568
You must be Sheldon Cooper.Yes, ma'am.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.397
Very well, Mr. Cooper,
how do you know

06:37.440 --> 06:40.095
you're not just dreaming
butterflies can't dream?

06:40.138 --> 06:41.313
Because I'm awake.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.098
Or are you dreaming
you're awake?

06:43.141 --> 06:46.014
You can see I'm awake
and you can hear me talking.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.885
Yeah... I don't know.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.975
I saw some pretty trippy stuff
at a Grateful Dead concert.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.414
The drummer turned into
a tap-dancing walrus

06:54.457 --> 06:55.937
and floated away.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.462
So we can't really trust
our senses, can we?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.724
We can validate them by

07:00.768 --> 07:02.334
comparing them
with other observers.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.467
Mm, but that would mean

07:04.511 --> 07:06.338
we have to hear what they say,

07:06.382 --> 07:10.517
which requires...
trusting our senses.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.476
Do you see a problem
with your argument, Mr. Cooper?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.391
I could concentrate better
if you weren't

07:15.435 --> 07:17.349
flashing your toes at me.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.526
Billy's a sweet kid.

07:19.569 --> 07:23.094
But these middle schoolers
are gonna eat him alive.

07:23.138 --> 07:26.750
You don't know that.
Maybe they'll be nice.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.360
Boy, if we were in
middle school right now,

07:28.404 --> 07:30.711
I'd have your head
in a toilet so fast.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.801
If you want, I can ask Missy
to hang out with him,

07:33.844 --> 07:35.498
make sure things go okay.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.761
Absolutely not.Why?

07:37.805 --> 07:40.547
That girl is cute and sassy,

07:40.590 --> 07:42.505
and has a real chance
at being popular.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.595
Do not take that from her.
Or me.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.337
Popularity isn't that important.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.687
It is the mostimportant.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.124
Look at us.
I'm miserable.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.823
You're always worried
about something.

07:55.866 --> 07:59.479
I'd like one girl
around here to win.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.307
I'm not always worried.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.353
It's Sheldon's first day
of college,

08:04.396 --> 08:06.529
and you're not freaking out?

08:06.573 --> 08:08.096
It's on my mind.Mm.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.186
But he's been looking forward
to this for a long time.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.536
I'm sure he's having
a wonderful day.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.452
She displayed complete contempt
for science.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.062
She claimed that
knowledge was a myth,

08:18.106 --> 08:19.977
and then she told the class
they could take their shoes off.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.544
Some of them did.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
Luckily we've established
you're a mature young man

08:23.590 --> 08:25.374
capable of figuring this out
on his own,

08:25.417 --> 08:27.376
so, go get 'em, sport.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.465
But as a man of science,
aren't you offended by this?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.511
Sheldon, this is
a college campus.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.295
You come across all sorts.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.123
Anarchists, communists, vegans.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.473
There's a fella in the religion
department that believes God is

08:37.517 --> 08:39.823
two women, and their names
are Wendy and Claire.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.173
But to say nobody
actually knows anything,

08:42.217 --> 08:44.524
how could she know that?
It's a contradiction.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.482
How about I blow some bubbles
out of a bear's head

08:46.526 --> 08:48.092
and we call it a day?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.964
I don't know how I'm going
to last all semester

08:50.007 --> 08:51.618
with this freewheeling hippy.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.576
Sheldon, I don't know
what to tell you.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.752
If you're that unhappy,
just drop the class.

08:55.796 --> 08:59.103
Of course.
Drop the class.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.018
This is college.
I can do that.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.194
There you go.
Thank you.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.240
You're welcome.From now on,

09:05.283 --> 09:07.155
I'm coming to you
with all my problems.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.678
Oh...

09:13.901 --> 09:17.382
"The statement on the other side
of this sign is true."

09:20.211 --> 09:21.212
Ugh.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.606
Professor Ericson?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
ERICSON:
Come in.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.221
Mr. Cooper, welcome.
How can I help you?

09:30.265 --> 09:31.962
I would like to drop your class.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.834
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.576
I enjoyed our discussion
about skepticism.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.968
And butterflies.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.491
I'm a scientist,
and I don't find

09:39.535 --> 09:41.493
those types of questions
worth my time.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.844
And butterflies are just worms
that can chase you.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.455
[laughs softly]
The questions of philosophy

09:46.498 --> 09:48.500
are extremely challenging.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.633
People have spent
2,000-plus years

09:50.677 --> 09:52.766
trying to solve them
without success.

09:52.809 --> 09:57.205
So if you feel like giving up,
I don't blame you.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.728
I'm not giving up.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.512
I'm saying
they're not important.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.515
Okay, so what isimportant?

10:03.559 --> 10:05.648
The acquisition
of factual knowledge.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.346
And how do you know
if something is factual?

10:08.390 --> 10:10.522
You test it
and see if it holds true.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.786
And how do you know
that that's factual?

10:12.829 --> 10:15.789
[strains]:
You're doing it again.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.139
Maybe you're dreaming
I'm doing it.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.531
How was your first day?

10:19.575 --> 10:21.664
Infuriating.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.231
How was your first day?

10:23.274 --> 10:24.667
So good.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.103
How was your first day?

10:30.717 --> 10:34.372
And then she said,
"Maybe you're just dreaming."

10:34.416 --> 10:36.548
Are you gonna drop the class?Yes,

10:36.592 --> 10:38.594
but only after
I systematically destroy

10:38.638 --> 10:41.684
her half-baked arguments
in front of everybody else.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.904
It's good to have goals.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.688
And at lunch,
an eighth-grade boy said,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.299
and I quote,
"I like Funyuns, too."

10:48.343 --> 10:49.692
Wow.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.954
I know.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.046
I stopped at the library today
and picked up

10:56.090 --> 10:58.788
books on epistemology,
Descartes's dream argument

10:58.832 --> 11:01.486
and the foundations
of scientific logic.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.053
Do you know
what she's going to do?

11:03.097 --> 11:04.664
Rue the day?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.056
The day, the night.
If it's rue-able,

11:06.100 --> 11:08.276
she's going to rue it.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.930
And in math class,
I sit right between

11:09.973 --> 11:11.366
Heather M. and Heather B.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.673
It's nice
you're with your friends.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.762
It's more than nice.
All notes go through me.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.720
That's power.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.462
♪ She's my cherry pie

11:20.505 --> 11:22.682
♪ Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise ♪

11:23.857 --> 11:26.207
♪ Tastes so good,
make a grown man cry ♪

11:26.250 --> 11:28.252
♪ Sweet cherry pie, yeah.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.566
ADULT SHELDON:
The good name of Lady Science

11:37.609 --> 11:41.222
had been besmirched and it was
up to me to defend her honor.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.615
I had a lot of ground
to cover in one night.

11:43.659 --> 11:46.923
Thankfully, 11 years of
my family's incessant yammering

11:46.967 --> 11:49.926
had given me an extraordinary
ability to focus.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.928
But I want to watch
Fresh Prince.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.756
Too bad. The game is on.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.497
There's always a game on. Dad?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.194
Sorry, kid, it's the Cowboys.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.413
But it's the season premiere.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.849
Fresh Prince's
family gets tickets

11:59.893 --> 12:01.242
to the People's
Choice Awards.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.765
I'm not missing it.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.201
"Present investigations
aim to establish

12:04.245 --> 12:05.899
"a constructional system.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.815
That is, an epistemic,
logical system of objects..."

12:08.858 --> 12:10.773
My show's only 30 minutes.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.732
Yours is three hours.

12:12.775 --> 12:13.863
But yours don't have
them cheerleaders

12:13.907 --> 12:15.909
jumping up and down.
Mom?

12:15.952 --> 12:19.260
What if we don't turn the TV on
at all and we play a board game?

12:19.303 --> 12:20.304
Come on.Seriously?

12:20.348 --> 12:21.784
SHELDON:
"So that a genealogy

12:21.828 --> 12:22.829
"of concepts results,
in which each one

12:22.872 --> 12:24.134
has its definite place."

12:24.178 --> 12:25.527
MARY:
Shelly, it's your turn.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.181
Shelly?

12:27.224 --> 12:28.922
What's happening?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.924
We're playing a board game.

12:30.967 --> 12:31.794
Before dinner?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.840
You ate dinner.

12:33.883 --> 12:34.884
[doorbell rings]

12:34.928 --> 12:36.146
Did I like it?

12:36.190 --> 12:37.887
You said the meat loaf was dry.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.323
That sounds right.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.939
Hi, Brenda.I just wanted to
see how today went.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.897
Oh.
[clears throat]

12:50.204 --> 12:52.293
[groans]
Not great.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.903
Sheldon is already
in some sort of fight

12:53.947 --> 12:55.905
with his philosophy professor.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.473
About what?Currently, he's plotting

12:58.516 --> 13:00.910
"the destruction
of her worldview,"

13:00.954 --> 13:03.434
whatever that means.Sounds exciting.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.176
It's mostly him reading a book
and giggling to himself.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.004
How about Billy?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.092
Not much better.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.833
Oh.
In Spanish class,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.966
every time the teacher said
"Sí,"Billy said, "See what?"

13:13.009 --> 13:15.098
Oh, Billy.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.841
I know, but if I don't
laugh about it I'll cry.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.016
I'm sorry.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.235
How did Missy do?

13:21.278 --> 13:23.454
I think Missy had
the best day of her life.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.761
[exhales]: Oh, thank God.
Tell me everything.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.939
Well, in one class
she sits between her friends,

13:29.983 --> 13:32.028
so the note-passing
goes through her.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.901
She's gonna get the dirt
firsthand. That's huge.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.294
And then an eighth-grade boy
talked to her at lunch.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.035
On the first day?Uh-huh.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.863
She's gonna be prom queen.
I'm calling it.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.125
[laughs]That's fun,

13:42.169 --> 13:45.215
but let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.435
Mary, it'll be a miracle

13:47.478 --> 13:49.741
if Billy even makes it
to high school.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.265
Don't take this away from me.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.225
Missy is gonna look so cute
in that tiara.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.096
Yes, she is.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.880
That's the Fresh Prince.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.490
He's from West Philadelphia.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.014
Born and raised.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.887
ADULT SHELDON:
It was past my bedtime,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.889
but who could sleep
with a page-turner

14:06.933 --> 14:10.110
likeMeditations on First
Philosophy by René Descartes?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.286
Descartes was more
than just a philosopher.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.288
He was also the mathematician

14:14.331 --> 14:16.551
who invented
the Cartesian plane.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.422
If you've ever enjoyed
that X squared

14:18.466 --> 14:20.642
plus Y squared
equals K is a circle,

14:20.685 --> 14:23.123
you can say merci beaucoup
to Monsieur Descartes.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.958
Hello?

14:32.001 --> 14:33.437
Bonjour, Sheldon.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.265
Bonjour, René Descartes.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.050
Please, sit.

14:40.488 --> 14:44.013
I see you're reading a book
on philosophy by Aristotle.

14:44.057 --> 14:47.495
I am. And it is garbage!

14:47.538 --> 14:51.716
Aristotle is,
how you say, a punk!

14:54.154 --> 14:57.592
I'm also having trouble
with my philosophy professor.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.247
Hmm?She says that we don't know
if science is true.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.118
Mon dieu!

15:02.162 --> 15:04.642
Without science,
we know nothing.

15:04.686 --> 15:08.037
No different than the dogs
and kitties in the street

15:08.081 --> 15:11.084
wandering around
in a fog of ignorance

15:11.127 --> 15:13.477
with the woofings
and the meowings.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.957
So how do I get her
to understand that science

15:15.001 --> 15:18.308
can form true beliefs
about reality as it really is?

15:18.352 --> 15:20.441
Ah, young man.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.052
You are you asking
what is the foundation

15:23.096 --> 15:24.967
of knowledge, huh?

15:25.011 --> 15:28.101
Yes.Well, hold on to your chapeau.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.102
I'm not wearing a chapeau.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.104
It is just an expression.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.018
Sorry.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.020
All knowledge must rest

15:34.063 --> 15:39.068
on a foundation that we can
never doubt and that is...

15:40.069 --> 15:42.028
Of course.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.290
ERICSON:
So we learned
that the theory of knowledge

15:43.333 --> 15:45.945
poses some
very serious problems.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.295
Excuse me, Professor Ericson.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.820
I've done a little reading since
last we spoke, and I'm prepared

15:51.863 --> 15:54.997
to show you that everything
we know about science is true.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.781
Well, I am all ears.

15:56.825 --> 16:00.089
You said I couldn't
truly know anything,

16:00.133 --> 16:01.525
but there is one thing
that I do know.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.615
If I question, I must think;

16:04.659 --> 16:06.356
if I think, I must exist.

16:06.400 --> 16:12.014
Cogito, ergo sum:
I think, therefore I am.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.496
You're right.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.237
You're darn right I'm right.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.501
Guys, g-give it up for Sheldon.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.111
[applause]

16:23.330 --> 16:25.245
Now for a job
well done...

16:27.116 --> 16:29.466
...here is a flower
full of sweet nectar.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.033
Why would I want that?

16:31.077 --> 16:34.080
Because you're a butterfly
and this is just your dream.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.777
I'm not a butterfly.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.866
Are you sure?
[laughs]

16:37.909 --> 16:39.259
[laughter echoing]

16:40.912 --> 16:42.088
[gasps]

16:42.131 --> 16:45.700
[sighs]
It was a dream.

16:45.743 --> 16:46.918
Oh, no.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.486
[grunts]
Help!

16:49.530 --> 16:51.358
I'm a butterfly!

16:51.401 --> 16:54.100
Nothing I know is real!
Everything is a dream!

16:54.143 --> 16:55.797
Missy, help!

16:58.582 --> 17:00.628
No!

17:00.671 --> 17:02.195
[gasps]

17:03.674 --> 17:04.849
Missy,

17:04.893 --> 17:05.807
am I awake

17:05.850 --> 17:07.026
or is this a dream?

17:07.069 --> 17:09.245
Shut up, dingus.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.290
Okay, I'm awake.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.690
Shelly, you feeling all right?

17:19.734 --> 17:21.040
Yes.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.345
How come you're not dressed?

17:22.389 --> 17:23.694
Why should I?

17:23.738 --> 17:26.088
'Cause you're gonna be
late for school.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.917
I'm not going to school.Why not?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.093
Because I don't know
what's real.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.051
What does that mean?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.704
Dreaming and waking,

17:33.748 --> 17:37.404
life and death,
philosophers and butterflies,

17:37.447 --> 17:40.059
they're all the same.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.496
Nothing matters.

17:42.539 --> 17:46.108
That's an interesting way
of looking at things.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.110
