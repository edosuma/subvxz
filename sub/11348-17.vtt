00:06.207 --> 00:07.108
(Male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.309 --> 00:12.246
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.548
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.582 --> 00:16.517
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.550 --> 00:17.785
are members of an elite squad

00:17.818 --> 00:20.121
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.623
These are their stories.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.758
Isn't this freaking adorable?

00:24.792 --> 00:26.660
It was on sale.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.663
So put the crib here,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.632
and changing table
over there.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.134
What do you think?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.535
I can't believe
my little sister's

00:34.568 --> 00:36.770
going to have a baby,
that's what I think.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.439
You still haven't told Mom yet?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.274
- Not exactly.
- Oh.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.376
Tommy wants to wait
till he and I are married.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.312
We're going to go to Montauk
in April.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.414
Hey, babe.
How does this look?

00:47.748 --> 00:49.183
Sonny, what are you
doing here?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.651
It's great to see you too,
Tommy.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.153
He's going to help us
move all the crap out of here.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.387
You know,
put up some shelves.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.822
We got, like, seven months.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.690
And I have to go see
my parole officer, remember?

00:56.724 --> 00:59.127
- Hey, how's that going?
- Great.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.794
Tommy just got
a promotion at work.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.263
They gave him
his own moving team.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.598
Yeah, I'm head
schlepper now.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.267
Well, make sure you tell
your P.O., all right?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.668
A raise, promotion, that's
brownie points right there.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.837
I want to get there early
so I can leave early.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.639
We got a doctor's appointment
this afternoon.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.142
- Our first sonogram.
- "Our."

01:14.175 --> 01:17.245
Did Bella tell you
I popped the question?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.247
She's going to make
an honest man out of me.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.448
That's great, Tommy.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.217
That's great.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.452
Wow.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.654
Just a lot of changes.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.390
Shut up.
He's really grown this time.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.824
I'm happy!

01:30.858 --> 01:34.328
Listen, I am happy for you.
This is going to be great.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.898
[groans]

01:37.931 --> 01:40.301
Sullivan,
you're still here.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.770
Good for you. Ha!

01:42.803 --> 01:44.472
How you doing today?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.340
You seem antsy.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.276
I'm good. I just--
I had a thing at 4:00.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.677
I've been here
since 2:00.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.412
A thing at 4:00?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.181
You want to tell me
about that?

01:53.214 --> 01:54.748
No. Let's just do this.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.784
- You are antsy, huh?
- Yeah.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.320
What was this thing?

01:59.353 --> 02:00.921
No, nothing like that.
I had a--

02:00.954 --> 02:02.656
I had a doctor's
appointment.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.693
Well, you should have made it
for a different day.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.295
It wasn't for me.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.931
My, um, fiancée, Bella,
she's pregnant.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.400
We were getting
a sonogram.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.934
She's pregnant?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.703
That's good news, right?
I'm going to be a dad.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.441
You're engaged,
and she's pregnant?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.942
That's a lot of stress.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.812
No. No, actually,
it's forcing me to grow up.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.380
I got a promotion
at the moving company,

02:26.414 --> 02:28.216
a raise, my own crew--

02:28.249 --> 02:30.784
So a thing like a urine test
won't be a big problem today?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.786
Oh.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.155
Right now? Right here?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.492
The bathroom's flooded.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.694
Still?

02:44.665 --> 02:45.799
[sighs]

02:45.833 --> 02:48.369
You can decline...

02:48.402 --> 02:51.439
and I'll ship your ass
upstate right now.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.346
[sighs]

03:11.392 --> 03:12.560
Huh?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.827
Cannoli?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.396
What, are you trying
to make me fat?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.797
Come on,
it's still winter.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.699
Just to be polite.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.503
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm good, thanks.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.672
Don't make me
eat alone.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.574
I'll take one for later.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.576
- Yeah, there you go.
- Sonny, where you been?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.977
I've been texting you
all morning.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.945
Jeez. Sorry.
I had class last night.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.847
I must have left my phone
on airplane mode.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.250
Hey, guys,
this is my sister, Bella.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.818
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.854
Hey, are you okay?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.590
What's--what's going on?

03:42.623 --> 03:43.857
Tommy didn't come home
last night.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.459
I'm totally freaking out.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.794
When's the last time
you talked to him?

03:46.827 --> 03:48.362
Right after my sonogram.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.930
He was still waiting
for his parole officer,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.565
And then now his phone
is going straight to voicemail.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.268
Calm down. Did you call
his parole officer?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.003
Are you crazy?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.905
Come here.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.408
Just take a seat in here.
I'm going to get you some water.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.376
Don't worry,
we'll find him, okay?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.782
(Tommy)
Look, I didn't want
to bother you, Sonny.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.518
Thanks for coming.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.286
My sister's going out of her
mind worrying about you.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.654
- I'm sorry.
- Now she's going to find out

04:13.687 --> 04:15.356
you got into some drunken
bar fight?

04:15.389 --> 04:16.824
You can't tell Bella.
You got to promise me.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.059
- You got to swear.
- You drank, you got busted.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.061
I'm not covering for you.
Also, you're in the system,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.431
which means your parole
officer's already been notified.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.932
Yeah, I'm not worried
about that.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.700
Well, you should be,
because when he finds out,

04:26.734 --> 04:28.302
he's going
to stick it to you.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.338
She. And she already has.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.406
So no way is she going
to bust me now.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.007
She?

04:34.041 --> 04:37.645
Hold on, hold on,
what are we talking about here?

04:37.678 --> 04:40.013
She made me.
I swear, Sonny.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.715
She made me do her.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.684
Whoa--
- You cheated

04:43.717 --> 04:44.685
on my pregnant sister?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.754
Whoa, whoa!
I didn't want to!

04:46.787 --> 04:48.956
She made me. She...

04:48.989 --> 04:50.391
She pulled her gun out on me.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.960
Please don't tell Bella.
Please.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.372
[dramatic music]

05:47.848 --> 05:48.982
I don't know what to think.
Tommy's always been this close

05:49.917 --> 05:51.619
to getting his life back
together, then boom,

05:51.652 --> 05:52.820
something happens to him.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.422
Everything always
happens to him.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.457
Yeah, well,
victims are imperfect, Carisi.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.459
You know, bad things
do happen to them.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.828
Yeah, but Tommy's been
a major disappointment.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.796
Major.
Like five years ago,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.732
he finally gets into college
at Utica.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.033
He decides
it'd be a great idea

06:06.066 --> 06:07.935
to combine pizza
and pot delivery.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.937
He gets kicked out of school,
he does three years inside.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.138
My sister...

06:11.171 --> 06:13.106
My sister waits for him.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.742
He gets out on parole,
and now this.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.610
Slow down, all right?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.512
If he was assaulted,
he needs your support.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.449
- So, what did he tell you?
- That's just it, Sergeant.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.484
He doesn't get
that he was assaulted.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.753
All right, well, it's hard
enough for women to disclose,

06:25.786 --> 06:26.954
but men...

06:26.987 --> 06:28.489
Just tell me
what he told you.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.891
He says his P.O.
pressured him into sex.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.160
Which, if true, is what,
custodial sexual misconduct?

06:33.193 --> 06:34.595
She's his P.O.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.664
That makes him legally
incapable of consent.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.699
She pressured him into
having sex with her? How?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.000
He said that after
an in-office urine test,

06:40.033 --> 06:41.702
she pulled a gun on him.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.037
She forced him to have sex
with her at gunpoint?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.640
I know. He's a guy.
He had to have been into it,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.175
or nothing would've worked.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.043
He went on a bender,
he cheated on Bella.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.912
You're probably thinking
this is a ruse.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.583
I'm thinking your sister's
fiancée may have been raped.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.618
I don't know.
Is that possible?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.687
- Carisi.
- Okay, I get it.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.221
It's possible.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.123
But he's never going
to go there.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
Not with you he isn't.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.134
(Benson)
Tommy Sullivan. Police.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.736
I'm in the middle
of a job here.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.004
If this is about
the bar thing--

07:17.037 --> 07:18.238
It isn't.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.140
Sergeant Benson.
This is Detective Amaro.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.109
- Manhattan SVU.
- SVU?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.578
Did Sonny send you?
Look, listen, like he said,

07:24.612 --> 07:27.247
I made a dumb mistake and I'm
willing to take the rap for it.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.082
Sonny, he told my sergeant
there may have been a reason

07:29.116 --> 07:30.484
you didn't go home
to your fiancée

07:30.518 --> 07:32.152
and stayed out
drinking instead.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.121
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this, okay?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.989
So you're just going to pretend
that nothing happened?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.891
Go back to your parole
officer next week

07:37.925 --> 07:40.260
and hope that she doesn't
pull a gun on you?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.496
Uh, yeah.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.097
I only got three months
probation left.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.766
- I'll suck it up.
- Well, what about your fiancée?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.267
What does she make
of all this?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.869
She doesn't know
and she's never going to know.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.170
Right now, she thinks
that I screwed up

07:50.203 --> 07:51.705
like I always do
and went out drinking.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.006
Listen, I got to get
back to work.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.608
This is my first time
supervising.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.843
Listen to me.
What happened to you--

07:55.876 --> 07:57.244
Is no big deal, okay?

07:57.277 --> 08:00.113
I didn't fight her off.
I didn't get hurt.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.550
It wasn't right.
And it wasn't your fault.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.084
And it's not going
to just go away

08:04.117 --> 08:05.919
if you pretend
it didn't happen.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.521
You think anybody's
going to believe an ex-con

08:07.555 --> 08:09.122
about something like this?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.725
All right, you don't have
to make up your mind now,

08:11.759 --> 08:13.260
but for Bella's sake,

08:13.293 --> 08:14.828
you should go to the hospital
when you get off work.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.263
- The hospital?
- Yeah.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.065
If your P.O. had
sexual contact with you,

08:18.098 --> 08:19.733
there--there could
be evidence.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.602
She could have exposed you
to STDs.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.572
You have a pregnant fiancée.
You owe it to her to get tested.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.774
Oh, God. I didn't even
think about that.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.241
So, what about your clothes
you were wearing last night?

08:28.275 --> 08:30.978
- Can you get those to us?
- Really?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.780
Yeah. Look, you violated
your parole.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.882
You don't know what she's going
to do or say about you.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.917
Tommy, a little help here.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.752
Yeah, okay,
just give me a sec!

08:38.786 --> 08:39.987
I really can't do this
right now.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.622
Okay, listen to me.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.990
Why don't you
come in tomorrow.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.858
Bring in the clothes
that you were wearing.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.695
One step at a time.
We'll take your statement.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.902
[exhales]

08:54.935 --> 08:56.704
I don't know.
No witnesses.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.740
He's still not sure
he wants to even pursue.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.975
- Something I should know about?
- Uh...

09:02.009 --> 09:03.611
Tommy came in
this morning.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.279
Rollins and Amaro
took the statement.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.748
I hate to drag you guys
into this.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.618
He's not even family.
But was he credible?

09:10.651 --> 09:13.020
Well, he's, uh...
reluctant.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.622
But consistent.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.024
He brought in the clothes
he wore for testing.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.159
So he wants to go through
with this?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.861
Honestly, I don't know
what he wants to do.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.730
- He's all over the place.
- Well, what he went through--

09:22.763 --> 09:25.098
- If it's true.
- It's a lot to process.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.001
We all know how difficult it is
for women to admit

09:28.035 --> 09:30.003
that they've been assaulted.
But men...

09:30.037 --> 09:32.105
I know. It just looks bad
that he didn't disclose

09:32.139 --> 09:33.874
until after he violated
his parole.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.375
So we do our due diligence.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.711
Let's see if CSU turns up
anything on the clothes.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tommy still
hasn't even told my sister yet.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.981
You got to slow this down.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.752
Carisi, you can't be part
of this investigation.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.755
But what you can do is walk
Tommy and your sister

09:47.788 --> 09:49.723
through where it can go.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.258
Copy that, Sergeant.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.595
So I should go now, huh?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.632
Yeah.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.937
Okay, so where were we?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.673
We checked out Tommy's P.O.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.941
Donna Marshall.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.978
She graduated with a Masters
in Social Work

10:11.011 --> 10:13.146
from SUNY Purchase,
top of her class.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.716
She's been at the downtown
office for over a decade.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.017
(Rollins)
Her boss, Ralph Kessel,

10:17.050 --> 10:19.720
just cited her
on the DOC website

10:19.753 --> 10:22.690
as having the lowest recidivism
rate in his department.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.024
Good. Invite him in.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.693
Anything else?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.995
(Rollins)
You think NYPD has a blue wall?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.429
You know how the Department
of Corrections

10:29.462 --> 10:31.164
- is going to frame this.
- (Benson) Oh, I do.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.766
But what if the genders
were reversed?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.902
Are you saying that a respected
male officer

10:34.935 --> 10:38.038
wouldn't abuse his power
to coerce a woman into sex?

10:38.071 --> 10:42.309
Look, guys, we all saw the look
on Tommy's face, his affect.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.277
We know that something
happened to him.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.413
So we take this case
as seriously

10:46.446 --> 10:49.049
as if it was a woman
accusing a male P.O.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.023
Mr. Kessel, thank you so much
for coming in.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.390
Have a seat.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.992
It's never good news
with you guys.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.894
- Hit me.
- Yesterday, a parolee

11:00.928 --> 11:03.430
made rape allegations
against one of your P.O.s.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.465
Not unusual.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.201
The amount of stories
these ex-cons come up with

11:08.235 --> 11:10.070
would put Stephen King
to shame.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.773
But just to play along,
which P.O.?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.174
Donna Marshall.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.711
Donna? You do know
she's a woman?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.914
- We do.
- Okay, let me guess.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.482
The lesbian welfare mom.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.185
She's on her third P.O.
in as many months.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.486
Actually, it was a man.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.790
A man? Seriously?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.291
[laughs]

11:31.324 --> 11:32.826
This gets better and better.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.227
Uh, how does that even work?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.096
Well,
she's a woman in power.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.966
And according
to the disclosure,

11:38.999 --> 11:41.034
Officer Marshall
pulled a gun on him,

11:41.068 --> 11:43.236
and he felt that he needed
to comply.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.172
Oh. Comply.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.473
He sounds like my wife.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.941
- [laughs]
- Mine too.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.444
I'm sorry, not everybody gets
my sense of humor.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.781
But, come on.
Donna, she's--

11:53.814 --> 11:56.784
She's barely a sexual being,
let alone a sexual predator.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.118
- She's all work.
- Well, you're right.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.386
This all may go away.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.955
But legally,
we have to follow up,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.957
and you need to cooperate.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.425
Of course.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.360
Just give me the name
of the lying son of a bitch

12:07.394 --> 12:09.229
who's yanking your chain.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.866
If he's filing,
it's public record.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.437
Well, you know, it is early
in the investigation.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.841
And it's clear that Officer
Marshall has your confidence.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.912
So I think we've heard
everything we need to right now.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.246
Well, okay.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.916
Well...

12:28.949 --> 12:30.517
let me know if there's
anything I can do.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.985
Thank you so much
for coming in.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.187
All right.
Thank you for having me.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.228
Wait, you had sex
with your parole officer?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.330
- Bella, it wasn't like that.
- And you're defending him?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.866
What happened between
Tommy and Donna wasn't sex.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.534
All right? She forced him.
She had a gun.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.402
- I swear to God.
- Just out of the blue?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.571
Why would she do that, Tommy?
You didn't come on to her?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.406
No! Bella, if I had, like,
a thing with her,

12:53.440 --> 12:54.975
you think I'd be telling you
about it?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.543
What kind of sex was this,
exactly?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.879
- Let's not get into details.
- But you had "sex" sex.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.081
- All the way?
- I had a gun to my head.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.916
- The whole time? No chance.
- She's my P.O.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.351
She said she could bust me
right there.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.186
I did what she told me
to do.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.055
You couldn't do it
when my parents were asleep

13:08.088 --> 13:09.923
two doors down, but you had no
problem with a gun to your head?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.459
Listen, Bella, my boss has been
doing this for a long time,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.361
and she says
that this does happen.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.329
- And she believes Tommy.
- Your boss?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.899
Does everyone know
you slept with her but me?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.834
(Tommy)
I didn't sleep with her.
Stop saying that.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.336
[knock on door]
(Donna) Tommy Sullivan!

13:23.370 --> 13:25.105
You better be in there!
It's past curfew!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.506
Who the hell is that,
your girlfriend?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
You have a home visit
scheduled tonight?

13:28.508 --> 13:29.910
- No.
(Donna) Open up,

13:29.943 --> 13:31.378
or we'll break it down.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.549
This is a home inspection.
Stay right where you are.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.385
- Who are you?
- I'm her brother.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.490
- Can I ask what this is about?
- You can shut your mouth,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.825
that's what you can do.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.098
(Tommy)
Oh, come on!

13:51.131 --> 13:52.332
There is nothing here.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.034
What did she just say?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.202
Tommy, what did you do?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.469
I didn't do anything.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
(Donna)
Got something.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.407
Oxycodone.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.575
Ready for retail.
Put your hands behind your back.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.977
- Tommy...
- I never seen those before.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.412
You're under arrest

14:05.445 --> 14:06.613
for the possession of illegal
prescription drugs.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.515
Those are not mine.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.183
Tommy, don't say another word
unless you got a lawyer present,

14:10.217 --> 14:12.019
- you hear me?
- He's right, Tommy.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.887
- You better call Saul.
- Ugh!

14:23.263 --> 14:25.532
Why didn't you tell them
you're a cop?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.367
Because that would not have
helped the situation, Bella.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.370
Drinking, cheating,
and now drugs?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.939
I'm supposed to be having
this guy's baby,

14:43.316 --> 14:44.284
Those drugs were not mine,
Sonny, I swear to God.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.319
So you're saying your
parole officer planted them?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.356
Yes. She must have found out
that I was accusing her.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.358
- Did you guys tell her?
- No. Of course not.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.961
No, we spoke
to her supervisor.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.595
- What?
- What?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.597
You never should have done that.
Those two are thick as thieves.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.399
I said that I wasn't even sure
that I wanted to go forward.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.068
All right, Tommy, they were just
doing their job, all right?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.669
Though a heads up
would have been appreciated.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.038
Let's focus on now. Can you
prove that oxy wasn't yours?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.140
- How do you want me to do that?
- Your drug tests are all clean?

15:07.174 --> 15:09.509
Yeah, but that doesn't matter.
She's claiming I'm a dealer.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.145
You know what?
Call her supervisor

15:12.179 --> 15:13.513
and tell him
that I got the hint.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.382
I won't be making
any accusations.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
- Maybe this all goes away.
- No, it doesn't work like that,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.020
Tommy, they made a bust
in your house, okay?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.688
It's not their call anymore.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.456
Then I'm done.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.258
I'm a three-time loser.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.560
Not if we can prove that she
had motive to plant those drugs,

15:27.594 --> 15:29.596
that she was trying
to discredit you.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.498
- Wait, what?
- Look, your best play right now

15:31.531 --> 15:33.133
is to go forward
with the rape accusation.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.334
Makes this bust
look like payback.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.603
Who's going
to believe me now?

15:36.636 --> 15:39.339
I do.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.245
So the supervisor
went straight to Donna

15:45.278 --> 15:46.679
and told her that she's being
investigated.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.515
Yeah, then she goes
on the offensive,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.350
she plants the oxy
in Tommy's house

15:50.383 --> 15:52.052
during a surprise
home visit.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.021
We can get the pills and baggies
tested for touch DNA.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.422
Hopefully,
Tommy's won't be on them.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.257
- It won't be.
- Okay, Amaro,

15:57.290 --> 15:58.725
when you're giving the lab
a heads up about the baggies,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.527
remind them that we're
still waiting for the DNA

16:00.560 --> 16:02.529
- from Tommy's clothes.
- Right.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.066
Hey, Sarge,
what about the rape charge?

16:06.099 --> 16:07.767
I mean, I know Tommy wasn't
the best witness at the start,

16:07.800 --> 16:10.237
- but now...
- We've been here before.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.773
They're going to accuse
and blame the victim, all right?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.476
He's in for a fight.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.111
I think he knows that.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.480
How's your sister
handling all this?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.482
Basically, she's not, you know?
I mean, she blames me.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.253
- So does he.
- That happens too.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.655
You did the right thing,
Carisi.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.523
I hope so.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.063
Yeah, I'll hold.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.730
No good deed, huh?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.332
So Tommy was a dealer?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.368
(Carisi)
Just pot, not oxy.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.770
He's put that all behind him.
He's been working his program.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.638
Well, he was in
a bar fight, though.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.075
Yeah, after she assaulted him.
He was decompensating.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.511
Maybe. But people do--
you know, they slip up.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.380
Sometimes you have to
let them hit bottom.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.248
Yeah, I know. It's just...

16:55.282 --> 16:57.250
things were going
really well for Tommy.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.186
Well, you know what?
Some people can't handle that.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.121
You know, they need--
they need the drama.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.755
Hey, I was there, all right?

17:02.789 --> 17:06.126
His P.O. was in and out of
that room in half a minute tops.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.660
Okay, well, you know what?
Somebody's lying.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.130
Then we--we have
to figure out who.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.668
She's kind of big
on tough love, isn't she?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.372
Look, her sister played
her so many times,

17:19.406 --> 17:21.841
she taught herself to
expect the worst from family.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.476
Yeah, well, her family
isn't my family.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.278
Tommy's not your family.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.813
Bella is.
Look out for her.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.417
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I'm still here.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.319
Thanks.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.653
Thank you.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.855
No way the touch DNA
came back that fast.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.824
No, but the results
from Tommy's clothing did.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.560
It tested positive for
Donna Marshall's saliva

17:40.593 --> 17:43.196
and, uh, fluids.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.764
So that proves they had sex.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.433
So we can bring her in.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.568
Look, at the very least,
she broke the law.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.472
Hey, it's good news, Carisi.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.375
You try telling that
to my sister.

17:56.876 --> 17:57.877
Get out of here
with that, would ya?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.246
No, Bella.
This is good.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.647
DNA evidence
backs Tommy's story.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.482
That he had sex
with that woman?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.484
Look, she knew this was coming.
That's why she planted the oxy.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.852
She's just trying to
make him look bad.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.187
He does look bad.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.421
The whole thing,
I can't take it anymore.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.190
I'm thinking of moving in
with Mom and Dad.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.224
On Staten Island?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.693
I cannot overstate how truly
insane that would be.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.495
I can't stay here.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.763
I've dealt with the drug busts,
prison, parole.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.030
For 10 years
I've dealt with it.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.234
- I draw the line at cheating.
- He wasn't cheating, though.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.370
This job makes you think
everyone's a victim to save.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.771
Like with Tommy.
You got over-involved.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.374
He told me he was a mess.
What was I supposed to do?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.442
Gina and Teresa kept telling me
I could do better.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.910
I should have listened to them.
- Oh, my God.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.446
I love our sisters, I do,
but they're crazy, okay?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.482
Teresa won't even talk to a guy
who makes less than six figures,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.650
and Gina, she's been engaged,
what, like 10 times?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.886
Don't put too much stock
into their opinions of Tommy.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.288
Why are you defending him now?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.489
He was never
your favorite either.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.790
Tommy's had his fair share
of screwups,

18:43.823 --> 18:45.625
but this isn't
one of them, Bella.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.794
Not to mention,
you're having the guy's kid.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.529
Maybe. We'll see.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.763
We'll see?
What does that mean?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.666
I'm only 10 weeks.
I got options.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.669
Come on, hey, don't
say things like that.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.538
It's too much, Sonny.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.407
I don't think I can do it.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.776
I don't think I can
raise a kid on my own.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.649
[dramatic music]

19:16.523 --> 19:17.724
So you admit that you and Tommy
Sullivan had a sexual encounter?

19:18.425 --> 19:21.261
Again, initiated
by Mr. Sullivan.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.264
I'm human.
I had a moment of weakness.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.399
- It was a mistake.
- Not to mention illegal.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.934
There's no need
to be didactic.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.869
Officer Marshall
is here to cooperate.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.672
Okay, so what exactly happened
in your office?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.474
Once we'd finished
with our meeting,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.276
I walked Tommy
to the door.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.678
And he said that he could tell
that I had had a long day.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.847
And I looked at him
and I nodded.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.783
And he asked if
I wanted a massage.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.718
And then he started
working my shoulders.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.587
And then he started
kissing me.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.955
And I told him
it was not a good idea,

19:48.988 --> 19:50.590
but he was aggressive.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.593
Okay, well, did you say no
or try to tell him to stop?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.828
When I say no, people listen.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.697
He didn't rape me,
Detective.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.931
And I certainly
didn't rape him.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.401
He came on strong,

20:01.434 --> 20:02.669
and it didn't feel terrible.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.337
And I let myself
enjoy the feeling.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.539
And by "it," you mean...

20:06.573 --> 20:08.475
Oral sex and intercourse.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.279
I'm going on the fifth
anniversary of my divorce,

20:12.312 --> 20:14.281
and it felt good
to be wanted.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.684
And Tommy Sullivan
made you feel wanted?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.686
In that moment,
very much so, yes.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.553
All right, I think

20:20.587 --> 20:22.689
we've humiliated
Officer Marshall enough.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.924
She's facing
interdepartmental discipline,

20:24.957 --> 20:27.394
but we are done here.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.695
Oh, well, we're just trying

20:28.728 --> 20:30.263
to get your client's
side of the story.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.265
It's okay, counselor.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.467
Okay, so you said that
Tommy initiated the contact,

20:34.501 --> 20:36.269
made you feel wanted.

20:36.303 --> 20:40.573
Were you aware that he put in
three requests this year

20:40.607 --> 20:42.008
to change parole officers?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.576
Mm, that doesn't
surprise me.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.478
I'm the toughest one
in my office.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.680
Really? So, what would
give him the impression

20:47.714 --> 20:49.349
that he could be
intimate with you

20:49.382 --> 20:51.351
after you said
that it was a bad idea?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.819
Parolees are manipulative.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.854
You know, they think
they have the upper hand.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.756
That's the nature of the job.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.858
Wasn't the job to not allow them
to have the upper hand?

21:00.593 --> 21:03.363
Let me ask you, uh,

21:03.396 --> 21:05.732
was there--was there a gun
in your office

21:05.765 --> 21:06.899
during this encounter?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.968
I carry, yes.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.403
Where was the gun?

21:11.871 --> 21:15.408
What, is he alleging that
I assaulted him at gunpoint?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.377
[laughs]

21:17.410 --> 21:19.479
He was ready,
willing, and able.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.315
I mean, do you think a man could
respond like that under duress?

21:22.349 --> 21:24.884
Actually, we do. Yes.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.553
All right, we came here
as a courtesy.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.555
But I've heard enough.
Donna, let's go.

21:28.588 --> 21:32.492
Tommy Sullivan is a criminal
and a con artist

21:32.525 --> 21:34.026
and a recidivist.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.728
He came on to me,

21:35.762 --> 21:37.730
and now he's claiming
that I'm a rapist

21:37.764 --> 21:39.866
because his pregnant
girlfriend found out

21:39.899 --> 21:42.502
that he cheated on her.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.607
There's nothing to see here.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.076
You believe that scumbag's story
over a fellow officer,

21:50.109 --> 21:51.878
then you should be ashamed
of yourself.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.386
She's a piece of work.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.454
And a liar.
Right to our faces.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.089
Still, a P.O.'s word
against Tommy.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.824
I mean,
her lawyer's right.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.793
He's looking at five years
for those pills.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.596
Maybe not. Lab report's back
on Tommy's oxy.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.431
It's like he said,
there's no trace of him.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.865
They did find
touch DNA, though.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.668
Belongs to Jordan Dolphy,
a paroled drug dealer.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.604
Guess who his P.O. is.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.611
[rapid knocking at door]

22:26.646 --> 22:28.014
- Jordan Dolphy, back up.
- Hey, what's going on?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.549
We got a warrant
to search your apartment.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.850
Hey, man,
you can't do this!

22:30.883 --> 22:32.652
Hey, hey, baby,
call my parole officer.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.953
(Rollins)
Yeah, Donna Marshall?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.588
You think she's going
to help you now?

22:35.622 --> 22:36.856
Check that coat.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.061
There anything sharp
in here?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.463
Uh-uh.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.635
Well, we got oxy.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.438
Hey, hey, listen,
let me just call Donna.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.839
Oh, yeah.
She'll explain it?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.974
So she's been your P.O. for,
what, three years?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.709
And in all that time,
you passed all your drug tests?

22:56.743 --> 22:59.111
You think I'm stupid?
This is a trap.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.880
I think you're in trouble,
Jordan.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.182
We found your DNA on
some oxy that Donna had.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.518
Wait, she said it was mine?
Donna made me give her that oxy.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.987
In exchange for what?
Clean drug test?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.058
Hey, baby, hold that call.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.699
She adds just the right amount
of vinegar to my urine.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.000
Oh, man.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.135
- It's the Donna Special.
- Righ.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.871
So she lets you off the hook,
you do whatever she says.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.873
So, what else do you
get her besides oxy?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.677
Other services.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.812
What do you mean
other services?

23:34.514 --> 23:35.815
Hey!

23:35.848 --> 23:37.650
Yo, Jordan.

23:39.519 --> 23:43.823
She's a divorced, lonely lady.
Use your imagination.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.958
Whenever she says
it's time for my piss test,

23:45.992 --> 23:47.960
that means it's time
to unzip.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.096
Drain my sack dry
every time.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.732
So does she make you have sex?
Have you ever said no?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.635
Yeah, yeah, I tried, once.
She pulled a gun out on me.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.170
But...it's like free sex,
I guess.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.675
I should feel lucky, right?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.782
Okay, we have DNA.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.519
Donna Marshall can't deny sex,
so she admits consensual.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.654
Classic she-said, he-said
in reverse.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.556
She also maintains
that if Tommy didn't want it,

24:16.589 --> 24:18.057
it would have been
physically impossible.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.126
Which we can get experts
to refute.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.928
And her other parolee,
Jordan Dolphy,

24:21.961 --> 24:23.830
he says Donna Marshall
raped him too?

24:23.863 --> 24:25.532
Yeah. Under threat.
Once at gunpoint.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.266
She makes him trade sex
for clean drug tests.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.802
Dolphy told us that Donna
made him give her the oxy,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.604
and she planted it
in Tommy's apartment.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.573
And both these male vics
are willing to testify,

24:33.606 --> 24:35.842
in open court, they were
forcibly raped by a woman?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.977
Dolphy will.
And Tommy...

24:38.010 --> 24:40.079
He will too.
I'll talk to him.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.716
Make sure he understands he'll
be subject to cross-examination.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.217
Their stories are consistent,
they're credible.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.819
- They're believable.
- Except for one thing.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.721
They're men.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.823
I got to tell you, I've never
taken a case like this to court.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.859
I can't find one D.A. here
who has.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.060
Tommy's got no choice

24:54.093 --> 24:55.595
but I don't know
if Bella's gonna be there.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.929
I will talk to her.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.732
Good. That leaves us
with just one problem.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.200
Convincing 12 people on a jury

25:01.233 --> 25:03.970
that a woman
even can rape a man.

25:13.813 --> 25:14.513
- This is so nice of you.
- Hmm.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.317
Sonny's always saying
how great you are,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.252
how much he loves
this job.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.655
Well, he's a good
detective.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.190
We're lucky
to have him.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.126
So most of those
are unisex.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.862
Look, I think it's so ridiculous
to buy baby clothes,

25:29.896 --> 25:31.998
because they can only
wear them for a minute.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.165
Yeah.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.601
Here you go.
It's herbal.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.836
Thanks.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.272
So, what you and Tommy
are going through,

25:40.306 --> 25:43.342
it's, uh...it's not easy.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.177
No.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.180
Bella, I've been doing this
a long time.

25:48.214 --> 25:53.052
And I know how hard
this can be for victims.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.088
But I also know that
it can be just as difficult

25:56.122 --> 25:59.291
on victims' families,
on victims' loved ones.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.327
This whole victim thing,

26:01.360 --> 26:03.029
I just don't know.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.132
But everything that Tommy
has told us has checked out.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.300
And it looks like his P.O.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.670
has done this to at least
one other ex-con.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.204
He's not just making it up?

26:12.238 --> 26:13.806
No.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.075
Sonny told me

26:16.108 --> 26:17.710
that sometimes women
say they've been raped

26:17.744 --> 26:18.711
when they don't want
their husbands to find out

26:18.745 --> 26:19.646
they were fooling around.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.948
Well, your brother has
a lot of stories,

26:21.981 --> 26:25.117
but this isn't
one of them.

26:25.151 --> 26:29.622
Tommy wanted no part
of what happened to him.

26:29.656 --> 26:32.058
Then how did he...

26:33.425 --> 26:36.295
With a gun to his head?

26:36.328 --> 26:38.230
You know, it just--
that seems impossible.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.999
Because it happens.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.836
It happens to men,
it happens to women.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.906
It's a mechanical
biological response.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.408
It doesn't mean
that the victim enjoyed it.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.644
It's like, you know,
a sneeze, or--

26:51.678 --> 26:54.881
or when you've
cut up onions.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.149
Right?

26:57.183 --> 26:59.251
Okay, so, what happens?
You cry.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.987
Actual tears.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.656
But it doesn't mean
that you're sad.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.727
Bella, I know what
I'm talking about.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.129
And I'm asking you
to trust me.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.331
To trust me about Tommy.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.670
- [baby coos]
- One second.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.375
Hi! Good morning!

27:23.409 --> 27:26.412
Hello, mister!

27:26.445 --> 27:29.048
Did you just wake up
from your nap?

27:29.081 --> 27:31.417
Okay, you come meet
Mama's friend.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.253
Look. This is Noah.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.922
Hi, Noah.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.025
Hi.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.793
[laughs]

27:43.195 --> 27:46.766
Is that when Mr. Sullivan
told you he'd been assaulted?

27:46.799 --> 27:48.935
It wasn't easy for him
to talk about it.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.070
He was, um, embarrassed.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.774
But I'm proud of him for coming
forward and telling the truth.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.408
Thank you,
Detective Carisi.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.444
(Judge Blake)
Your witness, Mr. D'Angelo.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.179
[clears throat]

28:01.380 --> 28:03.983
So you said Mr. Sullivan
was embarrassed,

28:04.016 --> 28:05.785
possibly even anxious?

28:05.818 --> 28:07.419
- Yes.
- Could that be

28:07.453 --> 28:08.821
because he was lying to you?

28:08.855 --> 28:10.322
- Objection.
- Sustained.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.824
(D'Angelo)
I'll rephrase.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.726
Mr. Sullivan told you
this story

28:13.760 --> 28:15.194
after he'd been arrested and you
had picked him up from jail,

28:15.227 --> 28:17.296
- right?
- Yes, but it wasn't a story.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.166
(D'Angelo)
And you're not just
his fiancee's brother,

28:20.199 --> 28:21.901
you're also an SVU detective?

28:21.934 --> 28:23.469
- Yeah, that's right.
- Which he was aware of.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.271
So is it possible,
Detective,

28:25.304 --> 28:28.074
that Tommy Sullivan
was trying to get your sympathy

28:28.107 --> 28:29.742
after he'd been arrested,

28:29.776 --> 28:31.477
after he'd cheated
on your sister,

28:31.510 --> 28:33.880
by telling you
that he had been raped?

28:33.913 --> 28:35.314
No, actually.
He wasn't even aware

28:35.347 --> 28:36.849
that a woman
could rape a man.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.951
(D'Angelo)
Oh, that's right.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.853
In fact, he only
used the word "rape"

28:40.887 --> 28:43.089
after he had talked to
your supervisor Sergeant Benson

28:43.122 --> 28:45.324
and Detective Amaro, correct?

28:45.357 --> 28:47.159
He did disclose to them.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.261
After you asked them
to talk to him.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.198
I mean, Mr. Sullivan didn't
think he had been raped at all

28:52.231 --> 28:55.267
until SVU detectives
told him that he had been raped.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.769
- Objection.
(Judge Blake) Sustained.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.838
Jury will disregard.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.042
Nothing further.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.248
Officer Marshall said
I had to give a urine test

29:09.281 --> 29:11.017
in front of her.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.921
So I unzipped my pants
and did what she asked.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.156
Then she told me
to lie on my back.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.458
And when I hesitated,
she pointed her gun at me.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.560
And after that,
I did whatever she said.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.462
(Barba)
And what happened next,
Mr. Sullivan?

29:23.495 --> 29:27.834
She handcuffed one of my wrists
to the leg of her desk.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.905
And then she rubbed me.
Put her mouth on me.

29:32.939 --> 29:36.542
I have to ask you
to be very specific here.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.178
Where did she put her mouth?

29:39.211 --> 29:43.149
Uh, she put her mouth
on my penis.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.217
Um, I didn't want it to...

29:46.452 --> 29:48.454
You know,
but my body responded.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.056
And then she got
on top of me

29:50.089 --> 29:51.891
and she forced me
to penetrate her.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.359
She raped you?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.897
Yes. She raped me.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.066
(Barba)
How did you react?

30:00.099 --> 30:02.334
(Tommy)
Well, I mean,
I was completely powerless.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.470
I'd felt angry, terrified.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.305
I was worried about
my fiancee.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.907
Worried that if I didn't
go along with it,

30:07.940 --> 30:09.308
Officer Marshall could
send me back to jail,

30:09.341 --> 30:12.578
or shoot me right there.

30:12.611 --> 30:15.147
You got to understand,
P.O.s have complete control.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.050
(Barba)
Thank you. Nothing further.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.453
[clears throat]

30:21.487 --> 30:24.456
So it's your contention that,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.926
while handcuffed
with a gun to your head,

30:26.959 --> 30:29.528
all of this
against your will,

30:29.561 --> 30:32.131
you were able
to perform sexually?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.466
Yes, but I did not want to.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.135
(D'Angelo)
Well, did you fight back?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.336
Did you scream?

30:37.369 --> 30:39.071
- No.
- No, of course not,

30:39.105 --> 30:41.007
because, as you claim,
you had a gun to your head.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.876
I mean, did she have the gun
in her hand the whole time?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.211
I don't think so.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.213
She might have put it down
at one point.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.982
According to your own testimony,
you had one free hand.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.650
I mean, you're a sizeable man.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.052
Why didn't you just
grab the gun?

30:53.085 --> 30:54.887
Because if I had
done anything--

30:54.921 --> 30:56.989
fought her, yelled at her,
if someone had come in--

30:57.023 --> 30:58.457
who knows what
she would have done.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.326
I only had three months
probation left.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
Until you got arrested
for oxycodone.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.930
No, that wasn't mine.
Officer Marshall planted it.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.465
Well, there are two
possible scenarios here.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.235
Scenario one:
a dedicated parole officer

31:09.268 --> 31:14.240
forces you to have sex with her
at gunpoint in her office,

31:14.273 --> 31:17.009
and then the next day,
she went to your apartment

31:17.043 --> 31:19.545
with three other
parole officers

31:19.578 --> 31:23.215
and planted drugs.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.517
Or scenario two:

31:25.551 --> 31:27.987
you go out drinking,
you violate your parole,

31:28.020 --> 31:29.588
and you get arrested
for fighting.

31:29.621 --> 31:33.993
That same dedicated
parole officer

31:34.026 --> 31:37.129
follows up with a search of
your house and discovers drugs,

31:37.163 --> 31:40.266
at which point,
you cry rape.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.368
Objection.
Are we on summations here?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.070
- That oxy was not mine.
(D'Angelo) Really?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.972
So did it belong
to your fiancee?

31:46.005 --> 31:47.506
- That's not what I meant.
- Not what you meant.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.675
Not what you wanted.
Not your fault.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.978
You're just all tied
up in nots, aren't you?

31:52.011 --> 31:55.681
- Objection.
- Withdrawn. Nothing further.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.218
You may step down,
Mr. Sullivan.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.687
We'll take a short recess.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.192
[indistinct chatter]

32:06.225 --> 32:07.126
I'm sorry, Mr. Barba.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.427
That guy kept twisting
everything around.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.196
You did fine.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.231
Cases look bad until
all the pieces come together.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.432
Jordan Dolphy's up next.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.733
When her attorney
kept asking you

32:14.766 --> 32:16.168
how the drugs
got into your apartment...

32:16.202 --> 32:18.237
They're about to find out.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.708
This isn't fair.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.343
They're making Tommy out
to look like the bad guy.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.979
- Welcome to my life.
- Hey, have you seen him?

32:27.013 --> 32:27.913
- Who?
- Jordan Dolphy.

32:27.946 --> 32:28.981
He was supposed to be
in the witness room.

32:29.015 --> 32:32.118
He's testifying next.
Have you seen my witness?

32:32.151 --> 32:33.719
The squirrelly
little guy?

32:33.752 --> 32:36.255
- Yeah. Where'd he go?
- He was jonesing for a smoke.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.024
I told him he had
to take it outside.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.492
Did you?
Come with us.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.237
Oh, damn.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.604
- What?
- I had a bad feeling

32:52.638 --> 32:54.440
while prepping him
last night.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.242
What, you just
let this guy go?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.543
He wasn't under arrest,
Detective.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.445
He was a material witness.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.313
Well, now he's immaterial.
What do you want from me?

33:01.347 --> 33:02.614
- Find him!
- Oh, okay.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.016
I'll get right on that.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.752
If he comes back
into this building,

33:22.334 --> 33:23.069
After an exhaustive
all-night search,

33:24.070 --> 33:24.770
we were unable to locate
Jordan Dolphy, Your Honor.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.672
We need to request
a continuance.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.574
You're not able
to proceed without him?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.309
His testimony is essential

33:30.342 --> 33:32.244
for establishing that Tommy
Sullivan was not dealing drugs.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.080
Well, then you should have kept
better tabs on him.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.815
My client has the right
to a speedy trial.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.484
He's right, Mr. Barba.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.353
Motion for a continuance denied.
Call your next witness.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.090
Mr. Dolphy was
our final witness.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.193
Does the prosecution rest?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.528
Yes...

33:49.561 --> 33:51.430
Your Honor.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.665
Well, then we'll call our
first witness, Jordan Dolphy.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.267
Excuse me?

33:56.468 --> 33:58.570
What is going on here,
Mr. D'Angelo?

33:58.604 --> 34:01.107
Mr. Dolphy came to us
after a sleepless night,

34:01.140 --> 34:03.242
and he told me
that he was coerced

34:03.275 --> 34:07.746
by the police to lie
in order to avoid a drug charge,

34:07.779 --> 34:09.381
and is being coerced
by the D.A.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.816
to continue the lie
on the stand.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.418
That's ridiculous.
Nobody asked him to lie.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.220
You can't call my witness.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.288
Sounds like he's not
your witness anymore, Mr. Barba.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.599
Two SVU detectives
burst into my home.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.101
They found oxy,

34:29.135 --> 34:31.237
and they also said
that they had my DNA

34:31.270 --> 34:34.240
on oxy confiscated
from Tommy Sullivan's home.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.807
And did they arrest you?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.609
No.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.645
They made it clear
that a deal could be made

34:39.678 --> 34:42.481
if I would agree to testify
against my parole officer.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.516
Donna Marshall,
the defendant?

34:44.550 --> 34:46.252
(Jordan)
Uh-huh. That's right.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.787
They had some trumped-up case
against her

34:48.820 --> 34:50.522
that they wanted me
to corroborate.

34:50.556 --> 34:54.660
And you're risking a drug charge
to testify here today.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.328
Could you tell the jury why?

34:58.230 --> 35:00.532
Officer Marshall's
been nothing but good to me.

35:00.566 --> 35:03.202
I couldn't let her go down
for something that I did.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.904
I'm the one that sold
Tommy Sullivan the oxy.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.274
She had nothing
to do with it.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.376
(D'Angelo)
Thank you, Mr. Dolphy.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.446
Your witness.

35:19.351 --> 35:23.422
Mr. Dolphy, you've been
Officer Marshall's parolee

35:23.455 --> 35:25.591
- for three years now?
- That's right.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.926
(Barba)
And in all that time,
you've never failed a drug test?

35:27.959 --> 35:30.196
- No, sir.
(Barba) Why is that?

35:30.229 --> 35:31.397
Because I'm clean.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.798
I see.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.234
You testified that
detectives found oxycodone

35:35.267 --> 35:37.703
- in your apartment.
- For sale. I don't use.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.171
You don't use oxy.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.806
But you do shoot heroin,
correct?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.374
Objection. Relevance?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.609
(Barba)
Goes to motive, Your Honor.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.277
The witness has
denied using drugs.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.646
- I'm entitled to cross.
- Witness will answer.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.716
And remember you're
under oath, Mr. Dolphy.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.754
- Do you use heroin?
- No.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.659
May I ask you to roll up
your sleeves, Mr. Dolphy,

36:00.692 --> 36:02.528
- for the jury?
- Objection.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.230
He can't make me
do this.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.698
Actually, he can.
Witness will comply.

36:08.434 --> 36:11.403
[dramatic music]

36:11.437 --> 36:19.445
*

36:32.291 --> 36:34.593
Are those fresh needle marks,
Mr. Dolphy?

36:34.626 --> 36:37.363
Yeah, okay? Yeah.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.266
So the question remains,

36:40.299 --> 36:43.535
how did you manage to pass three
years worth of urine tests?

36:43.569 --> 36:45.937
I'd like to request
a recess, Your Honor.

36:45.971 --> 36:49.608
Now? He's my witness.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.543
Agreed.
Continue, Mr. Barba.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.613
Did you or did you not
tell SVU detectives

36:54.646 --> 36:59.585
that Officer Marshall doctored
your urine tests with vinegar?

37:02.421 --> 37:04.423
I--I don't recall.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.925
And did you or did you not
tell SVU detectives

37:06.958 --> 37:08.794
that you were coerced
into sex with the defendant

37:08.827 --> 37:10.796
in exchange for
clean drug tests?

37:10.829 --> 37:12.698
- Objection!
- Overruled.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.266
You said you were going
to fix this!

37:14.300 --> 37:16.802
That the drug charge
would just go away!

37:16.835 --> 37:21.273
Are you referring to Officer
Marshall's boss, Ralph Kessel?

37:21.307 --> 37:23.975
Did he convince you
to testify for the defense?

37:26.312 --> 37:28.013
[sighs]

37:28.046 --> 37:30.816
You don't get it.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.585
These people,
they own your ass.

37:33.619 --> 37:36.288
They run the table.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.824
You want to stay out of prison,
you do what they say.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.592
I need a recess,
Your Honor.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.294
I'm sure you do.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.330
No more questions.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.967
Never trust a junkie.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.315
- What's this about?
- Donna.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.683
She wasn't going
to take the stand,

38:04.716 --> 38:06.718
but after Dolphy's testimony,
she has to.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.454
So this may not
go well for her.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.721
(D'Angelo)
Let's cut to the chase.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.090
My client is willing to plead
guilty to evidence tampering.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.659
She'll lose her job.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.328
She raped Tommy Sullivan
at gunpoint.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.829
There is no evidence of that.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.531
If she takes the stand,
a decorated officer

38:19.565 --> 38:20.966
with an impeccable
reputation,

38:20.999 --> 38:23.869
and tearfully confesses
to a sexual indiscretion--

38:23.902 --> 38:25.371
when is the last time
a Manhattan jury

38:25.404 --> 38:26.872
convicted a woman
of raping a man?

38:26.905 --> 38:28.607
Can you tell me?
Because I don't know.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.476
Why are we here?

38:30.509 --> 38:32.010
Because my client does not want
to suffer the humiliation

38:32.043 --> 38:34.746
of taking the stand
and discussing her sex life.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.517
And she wants to avoid
the likelihood of going to jail.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.688
We plead guilty
to evidence tampering.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.722
Year's probation.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.426
And the rape?

38:47.459 --> 38:48.894
We'll agree to
sexual misconduct.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.962
Five year's probation.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.864
And she goes
on the registry.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.034
That doesn't work for me.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.669
That's not going
to work for you?

38:59.505 --> 39:02.107
You might want
to think about this.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.975
You're a P.O.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.544
Do you really want to spend
the next five years

39:05.577 --> 39:07.979
of your life in prison?

39:12.418 --> 39:13.719
Fine.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.822
You don't know
what it's like.

39:16.855 --> 39:20.526
You cops, you lock
these animals up

39:20.559 --> 39:22.127
and you never have
to deal with them again.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.995
Donna!

39:24.029 --> 39:27.098
I'm--I'm--I'm supposed
to rehabilitate them.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.702
I gave up my life,

39:30.736 --> 39:33.004
my marriage
for this job.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.742
And then Tommy Sullivan
comes waltzing in all buzzy,

39:36.775 --> 39:38.610
talking about
his pregnant girlfriend

39:38.644 --> 39:40.446
and his wonderful new life.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.614
That doesn't give you the right
to do what you did to him.

39:42.648 --> 39:43.982
I tried to help him!

39:44.015 --> 39:46.418
I tried to help
all of them!

39:46.452 --> 39:47.953
And you know what they do?

39:47.986 --> 39:50.889
They take your hand and they
drag you down to their level.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.530
They don't want to change.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.866
They will never change.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.970
Time to get your client
out of here, counselor.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.838
We're done.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.114
So Donna's
not going to jail?

40:16.147 --> 40:18.850
No. But she is going
to lose her job.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.986
She'll be on probation.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.854
She's going to be on
the Sex Offender's Registry.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.490
And that supervisor, Kessel,
they're gonna investigate him.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.724
He'll get tossed too.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.125
What about Tommy?

40:27.158 --> 40:28.727
The D.A.'s going to drop
the drug charges.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.696
He should be home soon.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.564
He's going to get
a new parole officer.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.233
So we're back
where we started.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.603
Are we?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.706
Look, Bella,
it took a real man

40:40.739 --> 40:44.109
to get up in court and tell
the truth like Tommy did.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.844
A hell of a lot of guts.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.747
And he did that
for you, Bella.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.749
For you and the baby.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.752
Yeah. I know.

40:54.986 --> 40:58.123
[knock on door]

41:06.297 --> 41:07.799
Bella.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.467
Tommy.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.107
[Tommy sighs]

41:17.676 --> 41:18.910
It's all going to be okay.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.847
We're going to be okay.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.850
Yeah. Yeah.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.853
[tender music]

41:27.886 --> 41:35.894
*

42:12.698 --> 42:15.667
[wolf howling]
