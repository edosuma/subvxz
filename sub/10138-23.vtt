08:17.122 --> 08:18.498
Oh, absolutely.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.460
Losing a competition

08:18.539 --> 08:21.460
can be very traumatic

08:21.501 --> 08:23.044
for a young child.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.968
I think you're missing

08:26.423 --> 08:29.968
my little parenting point here.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.262
Now, this isn't about

08:30.010 --> 08:32.262
winning or losing.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.972
[laughing]

08:32.304 --> 08:33.972
Of course it isn't.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.557
Especially if you're losing.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.519
You wouldn't wanna get

08:36.599 --> 08:39.519
her hopes up for nothing.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.022
I-I don't know if you saw

08:39.560 --> 08:42.022
Michelle riding out there

08:42.063 --> 08:44.149
but if she entered the

08:42.063 --> 08:44.149
competition, she could win.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.527
Enjoy your little fantasy,

08:44.191 --> 08:47.527
because in reality

08:47.568 --> 08:50.738
my Elizabeth wins

08:47.568 --> 08:50.738
this competition every year.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.867
Oh, really?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.867
Well, not this year.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.036
Because Michelle Tanner

08:53.908 --> 08:56.036
is gonna kick your butt.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.042
Come along, Elizabeth.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.585
This is why you

09:02.083 --> 09:04.585
don't go to public school.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.883
Come along, Michelle,

09:07.588 --> 09:09.883
we're going shopping.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.426
But dad, I thought

09:09.924 --> 09:11.426
you don't want to spend

09:11.468 --> 09:13.094
all that money on new stuff.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.930
Yes, but that's before I was

09:13.136 --> 09:15.930
just reminded how much money

09:15.972 --> 09:18.225
we're gonna save by sending

09:15.972 --> 09:18.225
you just to public school.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.403
- Hey.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.403
- 'Hey, dad.'

09:30.737 --> 09:33.365
Oh, camera and a saddle.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.365
Big date tonight?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.243
No.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.578
This saddle is gonna be ridden

09:36.284 --> 09:38.578
by the best-dressed rider

09:38.619 --> 09:41.206
in the Bayview Junior

09:38.619 --> 09:41.206
Equestrian Competition.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.708
I proudly give you

09:41.248 --> 09:43.708
the lovely Michelle Tanner.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.798
Wow, Michelle.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.342
Hey, if we gave you a lantern

09:52.384 --> 09:54.261
you could stand out

09:52.384 --> 09:54.261
on the front lawn.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.722
Thanks for buying me

09:55.970 --> 09:57.722
all this stuff, dad

09:57.764 --> 09:59.140
but what if I don't win?

09:59.182 --> 10:00.267
Don't worry about it,

09:59.182 --> 10:00.267
sweetheart.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.309
Winning is not everything.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.769
I'm glad to hear that.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.021
Yeah, as long as you beat

10:02.810 --> 10:05.021
that Elizabeth girl

10:05.063 --> 10:06.606
with that loud mouth mother.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.942
[knocking on door]

10:08.983 --> 10:10.944
I-I-I'll get that.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.072
Michelle, scram.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.202
- Oh. Hi, Andrew. Come in.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.202
- Hi.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.082
So, um, you all ready to

10:21.121 --> 10:24.082
rehearse a little Shakespeare?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.251
You bet. I've been reading

10:24.124 --> 10:26.251
the play all day.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.586
Yeah. Me too.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.753
Do you understand it?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.505
- Not a word.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.505
- Me, neither.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.550
Michelle. I said "out."

10:33.592 --> 10:35.218
Why do<i> I</i> have to leave?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.095
Because I said so.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.431
You know, Steph, it might be a

10:37.137 --> 10:39.431
good idea to have an audience.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.850
Exactly what I was thinking.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.437
So, um, why don't we take it

10:42.892 --> 10:45.437
from where we left off.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.687
Right before the kiss.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.108
Now this I've got to see.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.950
"My bounty is as bountless

10:55.363 --> 10:58.950
as the sea, my love is deep.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.910
"The more I give to thee,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.910
the more I have

11:00.952 --> 11:03.079
for both are infinite."

11:03.121 --> 11:05.123
Uh, this is where you

11:03.121 --> 11:05.123
scale the balcony.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.208
But for now you can

11:05.165 --> 11:07.208
just use the stairs.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.376
Right.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.174
I hear some noise within,

11:11.546 --> 11:14.174
dear love, adieu.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.472
And we kiss.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.472
End of scene.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.352
I knew it, dry lips.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.021
Excuse me?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.982
That's okay, I don't blame you.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.982
It's like kissing a cactus.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.985
- Michelle!

11:32.150 --> 11:33.985
- What's the big deal?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.112
I didn't tell him

11:34.027 --> 11:36.112
you have a crush on him.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.326
Pardon me, Andrew,

11:38.490 --> 11:41.326
whilest I breaketh her bones!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.161
- Dry lips, dry lips.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.161
- Shut up.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.871
'Why don't you guys

11:43.203 --> 11:44.871
work this out?'

11:44.912 --> 11:46.873
- 'Um, see you later, Steph.'

11:44.912 --> 11:46.873
- Listen, Andrew.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.041
But..

11:49.708 --> 11:51.419
Michelle, I can't believe

11:49.708 --> 11:51.419
you would do this to me!

11:51.461 --> 11:53.004
I'm never gonna forgive you.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.842
I guess dry lips

11:55.340 --> 11:57.842
make people cranky.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.225
Uncle Jesse, can we talk?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.478
Absolutely, but not right now.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.478
I got too many things going on.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.854
Joey and I gotta

12:08.520 --> 12:09.854
work on some holds

12:09.896 --> 12:11.648
for this wrestling thing

12:09.896 --> 12:11.648
we're doing.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.692
Is it important, munchkin?

12:13.732 --> 12:17.571
Well, I'm just really worried

12:13.732 --> 12:17.571
about this jumping competition.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.280
Oh, don't worry about it.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.280
You're gonna be great.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.948
You're gonna knock them dead,

12:19.322 --> 12:20.948
you gonna kill them, you gonna..

12:20.990 --> 12:23.993
You're gonna do whatever it is

12:20.990 --> 12:23.993
you do at those competitions.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.328
Jump.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.622
Oh, yeah. Okay,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.622
you're gonna do that.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.208
Well, I'm glad you're gonna

12:27.664 --> 12:30.208
be there on Saturday.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.751
Well, hold that

12:30.250 --> 12:32.751
gladness, shorty.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.878
I don't think I'm gonna

12:32.793 --> 12:33.878
be able to make it.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.422
I've got so many

12:33.920 --> 12:35.422
things going on.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.048
I got the.. I've gotta

12:35.463 --> 12:37.048
do the books for the Smash club.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.883
I've got to rehearse the band,

12:37.090 --> 12:38.883
I got to find a new band

12:38.925 --> 12:41.261
for the Smash club. I got to do

12:38.925 --> 12:41.261
this wrestling thing with Joey.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.054
I don't think I even have

12:41.302 --> 12:43.054
time to finish this sentence.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.138
You just did.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.764
Oh, you see?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.764
I'm behind already.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.892
I'm sorry, kiddo,

12:45.806 --> 12:47.892
you'll be great.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.314
Ah, behold.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.858
The Masked Marvel!

12:58.819 --> 13:00.530
It's more like

12:58.819 --> 13:00.530
the Masked Meat-head.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
Come on, Jess,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
we're gonna be in the ring

13:04.492 --> 13:06.327
with professional wrestlers.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.912
We gotta look the part,

13:06.369 --> 13:07.912
everything's gotta be

13:07.954 --> 13:09.497
big and theatrical.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.250
Now, throw another pillow

13:09.539 --> 13:12.250
on this couch

13:12.292 --> 13:13.834
and check out this entrance.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.836
Aargh!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.549
'Aargh.'

13:20.216 --> 13:21.426
Aargh!

13:22.843 --> 13:23.802
[Joey screaming]

13:23.844 --> 13:24.971
[Joey grunts]

13:32.395 --> 13:34.564
- Joey.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.564
- Yes?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.276
You wanna, you wanna

13:36.190 --> 13:38.276
just skip the entrance?

13:39.486 --> 13:43.114
Okay. Yeah, I think so.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.408
That's a, that's a

13:43.156 --> 13:45.408
good idea, Jess.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.868
Get up, get up.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.412
We gotta practise some

13:47.910 --> 13:49.412
wrestling holds here

13:49.454 --> 13:51.080
so we don't look like

13:49.454 --> 13:51.080
fools in the ring, okay?

13:51.122 --> 13:52.749
- Okay.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.749
- I'm over here.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.627
- You're over there.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.627
- Right.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.086
Now, come over here. I wanna put

13:55.669 --> 13:57.086
you in a little headlock here.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.630
- Okay.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.630
- Bend over.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.134
[groaning]

14:04.969 --> 14:06.429
Can we play too, daddy?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.431
Boys, we're not playing,

14:06.471 --> 14:08.431
we're working.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.186
You got a weird job.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.730
That's 'cause I have a weird

14:13.227 --> 14:15.730
partner. Alright, what's next?

14:15.772 --> 14:18.941
Now, Jess, I do

14:15.772 --> 14:18.941
what's called an escape.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.860
Which is?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.945
[Joey shouting]

14:25.657 --> 14:28.868
Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! Aargh!

14:28.909 --> 14:30.411
Aargh!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.623
[growls]

14:35.166 --> 14:36.167
Hey, are you okay?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.752
I think I bruised a sideburn.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.381
- We'll help you, daddy.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.381
- No, no, no, boys.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.800
Don't help, okay? Just,

14:41.422 --> 14:43.800
just go sit down over there.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.636
You're no fun anymore.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.305
Boys, there's time

14:47.595 --> 14:49.305
to have fun

14:49.347 --> 14:50.515
and there's a time

14:49.347 --> 14:50.515
to be serious.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.016
Right now it's time

14:50.557 --> 14:52.016
to be serious.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.852
Joey, put your ankle

14:52.058 --> 14:53.852
in my arm-pit.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.104
No, Jess,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.104
let's try this.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.439
Lay down flat on the mat

14:58.481 --> 15:00.024
and put one of your legs

14:58.481 --> 15:00.024
up in the air.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.237
Nothing personal.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.157
Okay. Alright.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.451
Now, that leg up in the air.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.412
I come over like this,

15:10.493 --> 15:12.412
I grab your foot

15:12.453 --> 15:16.499
I put my leg over like this,

15:12.453 --> 15:16.499
I put that hand there and then..

15:16.541 --> 15:19.252
Ow, ow. Why are you

15:16.541 --> 15:19.252
twisting my ankle?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.337
- So that this will feel good.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.337
- What?

15:21.379 --> 15:22.839
- Aargh!

15:21.379 --> 15:22.839
- Oh!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.259
You got my legs all locked up.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.635
That's the name, leg-lock.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.929
How do we un-lock 'em?

15:29.970 --> 15:35.685
Well, either I put my foot

15:29.970 --> 15:35.685
around your neck like this..

15:35.727 --> 15:36.686
And..

15:36.728 --> 15:39.272
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.566
This isn't working.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.944
The other way is to, um,

15:41.608 --> 15:44.944
get the big book

15:44.985 --> 15:47.906
of wrestling holds off my bed

15:44.985 --> 15:47.906
and see what it says.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.120
Boys, boys, here's your chance

15:51.075 --> 15:54.120
to help daddy.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.206
Run upstairs, and get

15:54.161 --> 15:57.206
the big book off Joey's bed.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.626
Sorry, you said don't help.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.755
Let's go, brother.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.132
(Jesse)

16:04.756 --> 16:06.132
Boys, b..

16:06.173 --> 16:07.467
Joey, this is all your fault.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.593
Come here so I can

16:07.508 --> 16:08.593
smack you on the head.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.969
Come here, come here.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.763
Come here.

'Welcome to Bayview

16:15.349 --> 16:17.685
Equestrian Center.'

16:18.311 --> 16:19.896
Hi, Michelle.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.148
Hey, Elizabeth, I wanted to

16:19.938 --> 16:22.148
wish you good luck today

16:22.189 --> 16:23.775
and tell your horse too.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.860
Thanks, good luck

16:23.817 --> 16:25.860
to you guys too.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.948
Hey, beautiful, how's my

16:27.278 --> 16:29.948
favorite junior jumper?

16:29.989 --> 16:33.242
I'm okay, but old Pepper Mill

16:29.989 --> 16:33.242
could use a pep talk.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.161
Ah. I can handle that.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.830
Alright, Pepper Mill

16:36.871 --> 16:39.666
I am gonna tell you the same

16:36.871 --> 16:39.666
thing my beloved track coach

16:39.707 --> 16:42.084
told me right before my

16:39.707 --> 16:42.084
very first big track meet.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.211
Tanner, you keep those

16:42.126 --> 16:44.211
water bottles filled.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.797
[horse grunting]

16:45.839 --> 16:47.340
Might not apply here, hon.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.470
Oh, there's my little champion.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.180
Now, listen. Don't forget.

16:54.221 --> 16:58.058
After you win we're going out

16:54.221 --> 16:58.058
for a big, victory dinner. Hmm?

16:59.226 --> 17:01.562
Michelle, after you win

16:59.226 --> 17:01.562
we're going out

17:01.604 --> 17:05.650
for a big victory dinner,

17:01.604 --> 17:05.650
and a victory movie.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.278
Now, Elizabeth..

17:09.320 --> 17:12.114
remember what your instructor

17:09.320 --> 17:12.114
told you about visualizing.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.618
Picture yourself jumping

17:12.156 --> 17:15.618
and clearing the hurdles.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.412
Michelle, you picture yourself

17:15.660 --> 17:18.412
jumping and clearing

17:18.454 --> 17:22.709
those exact same hurdles,

17:18.454 --> 17:22.709
only jumping higher and faster.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.462
How dare you steal

17:24.002 --> 17:26.462
our visualizations?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.506
I paid good money for those.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.634
'The next rider is Alison Stare.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.634
She's on Lightning.'

17:31.676 --> 17:35.179
Uh, dad, we really need

17:31.676 --> 17:35.179
to get ready for the contest.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.891
I'll see you in

17:35.221 --> 17:37.891
the winner's circle.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.810
Winner's circle? I guess you'll

17:37.932 --> 17:40.810
be there to congratulate us.

17:43.437 --> 17:47.483

17:43.437 --> 17:47.483
'The last senior contestant

17:43.437 --> 17:47.483
is Julia Picard riding Speed.'

17:51.029 --> 17:52.697
Riding used to be fun.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.575
Yeah, before parents got

17:52.739 --> 17:55.575
involved.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.370
I've got an idea. Why don't we

17:55.616 --> 17:59.370
skip the contest

17:59.412 --> 18:02.790
and just go riding

17:59.412 --> 18:02.790
on the trail? For fun.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.959
Tanner, you're a genius.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.463
- This is gonna be great.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.463
- Yeah.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.883
Hey, let's head out

18:09.505 --> 18:11.883
to the trail, come on.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.468
- Trot.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.468
- This is so fun!

18:15.428 --> 18:17.471
- Hey.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.471
- Hey, man.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.723
How's Michelle doing?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.349
She's doing great.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.349
She's ready to roll.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.226
She's champing at the bit.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.686
Actually, that was Pepper Mill.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.858
Mama, we want a horse.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.193
Okay, I'll get you one

18:28.900 --> 18:31.193
when you're older.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.486
How old?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.114
Old enough to carry a shovel.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.967
Where's my Elizabeth?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.384
She's not there.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.389
I guess her kid

18:57.637 --> 19:00.389
couldn't handle the pressure.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.892
Dad, Michelle's not

19:00.431 --> 19:02.892
out there either.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.811
I thought you just

19:02.934 --> 19:04.811
told me she was champing?

19:04.852 --> 19:06.771
Uh, that was her horse.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.731
He's missing too.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.483
Okay, we'll be right back,

19:08.773 --> 19:10.483
wait here.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.238
She's not in there.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.865
- Where could she be?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.865
- Don't know.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.117
Jess, what are you doing here?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.701
Hey, guys.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.701
I re-arranged some stuff.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.202
I'm gonna do the books tonight,

19:20.743 --> 19:22.202
rehearse tomorrow.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.871
And I'm gonna check out

19:22.244 --> 19:23.871
the new band next week.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.083
And if I keep talking, we're

19:23.913 --> 19:27.083
gonna miss the competition.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.043
I'm glad you're here, but right

19:27.125 --> 19:29.043
now we gotta find Michelle.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.461
What do you mean

19:29.085 --> 19:30.461
"find Michelle?" Where is she?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.797
- I don't know.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.797
- Hold on, guys.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.050
Uh, excuse me, sir, uh,

19:32.839 --> 19:36.050
have you seen a little girl..

19:36.092 --> 19:39.720
Blond hair, about yay high,

19:36.092 --> 19:39.720
with just the cutest darn smile

19:39.762 --> 19:41.973
and a big smelly horse?

19:42.015 --> 19:45.018
You know, I never thought

19:42.015 --> 19:45.018
I'd get a chance to say this

19:45.059 --> 19:47.227
but they went that-a way.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.438
Can we borrow these horses?

19:49.480 --> 19:50.940
- Help yourself.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.940
- Thank you.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.692
They ain't mine.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.444
Uh, excuse me sir,

19:52.733 --> 19:55.444
would it be okay, if I, uh..

19:55.486 --> 19:57.237
if I borrowed this

19:55.486 --> 19:57.237
little horse right here?

[neighing]

19:58.489 --> 20:00.240
That's ain't a horse, Greenhorn.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.618
That's a burro,

20:00.282 --> 20:02.618
name's Milton.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.205
Milton Burro.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.205
What else?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.249
'Let's go.'

20:09.291 --> 20:11.085
Come on, Milton.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.085
Let's go.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.846
[serene music]

20:30.813 --> 20:33.733

20:30.813 --> 20:33.733
you don't have to win anything.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.360
Yeah, it's cool.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.404
Hey, wanna jump that log?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.780
Yeah.

Michelle!

21:02.970 --> 21:04.097
Michelle!

21:05.514 --> 21:06.891
Michelle, are you okay?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.893
Michelle, wake up.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.604
- Ho.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.604
- 'Michelle, wake up.'

21:13.064 --> 21:14.774
She fell off her horse.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.692
Michelle? Don't move her.

21:16.734 --> 21:17.985
She hit her head.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.862
Oh, my gosh.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.405
What happened?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.490
- Is she okay?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.490
- I don't know.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.700
Michelle?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.244

21:48.141 --> 21:50.392
so much pressure on you.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.645
That's okay.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.188
Who are you?

21:54.230 --> 21:57.191
Well, memory loss is very common

21:54.230 --> 21:57.191
with head injuries.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
Come on in, Michelle.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
Don't be scared.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.861
Do you remember us?

22:00.903 --> 22:03.197
Aren't you the nice people

22:00.903 --> 22:03.197
I met at the hospital?

Jesse's our uncle.

Right. The guy with the hair.

I know you all

22:10.746 --> 22:13.124
want me to remember

22:13.166 --> 22:14.834
but I can't.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.418
I'm sorry.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.378
What if she never remembers us?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.506
We're a family.
