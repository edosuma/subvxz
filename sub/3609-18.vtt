Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:04.914
Is that a helicopter?

00:05.006 --> 00:07.418
Is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

00:07.508 --> 00:10.045
Get away from her!

00:10.678 --> 00:12.464
Desmond...

00:14.807 --> 00:16.013
What's wrong?

00:16.100 --> 00:18.386
- What's wrong is I'm married.
- Right.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.400
You're pregnant.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.754
[footsteps]

01:04.398 --> 01:06.138
Hey.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.059
Good morning, Jack.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.109
Need a hand?

01:11.197 --> 01:13.188
Thank you.

01:19.163 --> 01:22.701
I came by your tent earlier.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.123
Is Jin gone?

01:25.503 --> 01:28.586
He went off with Charlie,
Hurley, and Desmond.

01:28.673 --> 01:31.710
- Did you need him?
- Actually, I was looking for you.

01:31.801 --> 01:35.794
I wanted to see how you were doing
with your pregnancy.

01:38.182 --> 01:42.642
I'm doing fine. A little tired,
but that's normal, right?

01:42.728 --> 01:47.313
- Sure. Any morning sickness?
- Not anymore.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.892
Any bleeding?

01:53.739 --> 01:56.355
Why are you asking me
all these questions, Jack?

01:58.244 --> 01:59.575
I'm just checking in.

02:00.663 --> 02:04.781
Now that I'm back, Ijust wanted
to make sure that you were doing OK.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.705
Thank you. I'm OK.

02:09.714 --> 02:10.874
Great.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.809
[phone ringing]

04:39.989 --> 04:41.570
- Who is she?
- I've no idea.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.694
She seems to know you, dude.
She just said your name.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.286
Never seen her before in my life.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.736
[coughs]

04:48.831 --> 04:50.241
She's waking up.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.948
[mumbles]

04:53.043 --> 04:55.750
She's trying to talk.
We should get her some water.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.080
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.084
[mutters in Spanish]

05:03.179 --> 05:05.465
- What's she saying?
- Don't know.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.048
- It's Spanish, dude.
- Do you understand her, then?

05:13.189 --> 05:14.429
She says she's dying.

05:20.738 --> 05:21.727
Oh, my God!

05:21.822 --> 05:24.154
A branch.
She must have hit it on the way down.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.654
Get her pack. We haven't
got much in this first-aid kit.

05:27.745 --> 05:31.033
- See if there's anything we can use.
- What if this is a rescue?

05:31.123 --> 05:33.614
What if she came for us?
Is she gonna be OK?

05:33.709 --> 05:36.075
Just go. Start looking.

05:39.548 --> 05:44.008
[Jin] We get Jack. Jack.
- She could be our way off the island.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.678
- If we move her, it'll make it worse.
- We just let her bleed to death?

05:47.765 --> 05:51.553
- No, we need to bring Jack here.
- It's an eight-hour walk, one way.

05:51.644 --> 05:54.477
- Then I'll run.
- Are you out of your mind?

05:54.563 --> 05:57.680
It's not safe.
Who knows who's out in this jungle?

05:57.775 --> 06:00.266
People on this island
are trying to kill us.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.521
Nobody knows we're here.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.728
[bang]

06:07.660 --> 06:09.321
[IOOIO]

06:16.585 --> 06:17.791
Oops.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.737
- How's this?
- That's perfect. Thank you.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.794
What do you think happened to Jack
while he was with the Others?

08:25.923 --> 08:28.835
Since he's been back,
he seems different.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.336
He says that he was
pretty much a prisoner,

08:33.430 --> 08:37.844
and he only cooperated 'cause he thought
they'd let him off the island.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.427
Do you believe him?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.223
Why wouldn't I?

08:46.443 --> 08:49.435
He came to me,
asking about my pregnancy.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.856
- What would that have anything to do...
- What if...

08:53.951 --> 08:56.033
What if the Others want my baby?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.122
He's been there alone for over a week.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.039
How do we know
he isn't working with them?

09:06.505 --> 09:08.996
He's not working with them.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.459
Do you know something, Kate?

09:22.104 --> 09:24.060
It's Juliet.

09:24.148 --> 09:28.141
She was their doctor, their fertility
doctor, studying pregnant women.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.774
And when Claire was sick,
she told me and Jack

09:32.865 --> 09:37.199
the reason the Others wanted her baby
was for research.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.457
Sun. Wait. You don't have to do this.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.536
Go away, Kate.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.586
I want to know about your research.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.589
- Sun...
- What happens to pregnant women?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.718
You're pregnant?

10:00.809 --> 10:04.518
- Are you sure? How do you know?
- | asked you a question.

10:04.605 --> 10:08.769
Everyone might be all right with you
washing your clothes, eating our food.

10:08.859 --> 10:12.818
But I want to know what's going on.
I want answers.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.697
What are you people doing?
Why are you taking children?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.991
What happens to pregnant women
on this island?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.870
- What happens...
- They die.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.378
They all die.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.625
Sun, come on. Let's go.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.264
- What's she saying?
- Chinese, not Korean.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.100
- Maybe we should pull it out.
- You'll make it worse.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.311
Have you forgotten what's at stake,
or is this another flash?

10:55.405 --> 10:59.398
- Who's getting an arrow in the neck?
- Lest you forget, she said my name.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.201
She had a photo of me
and my girlfriend.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.330
I understand better than the lot of you.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.577
Hey, guys, chill.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.502
We've wasted enough time already.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.965
- You're not leaving us.
- Get out of my way.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.630
No.

[grunting]

12:36.006 --> 12:37.041
Who are you?

12:38.842 --> 12:41.049
I said, who are you?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.717
He's the guy who shot Sayid.

12:45.807 --> 12:50.426
Kate told us he lived out in that
station Locke blew up. He's an Other.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.388
I thought Locke killed that guy
with the electro-fence thingy.

12:54.483 --> 12:58.271
You've got five seconds to talk
or | fire this gun, brother.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.524
That's a flare gun.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.276
And how do you think it'll feel

13:03.367 --> 13:06.859
taking a flare to the chest
at this range?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.163
As your friend pointed out,
I already died once this week.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.458
- You understand her.
- She's speaking Italian.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.214
She said she's dying.
She needs help.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.432
I was a Soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.349
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.986
This branch has punctured her lung.
It's filling with blood.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.113
If it is not ventilated soon,
she is going to die.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.241
Well, do it. Help her.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.578
If I fix her, you must let me walk away
as if I never came upon you.

- Be quiet. Don't move.

18:05.669 --> 18:09.082
You want me to help you
and your baby, I have answers.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.413
But you have to
come with me right now.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.341
Just you and me. Nobody else.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.264
If what you said was true,
that means I'm already dead.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.348
- Why should I go anywhere with you?
- Because there may be hope for you yet.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.007
Where are we going?

18:57.095 --> 19:00.383
There's a medical station.
They have an ultrasound machine.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.261
Claire and Kate
told me about that place.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.729
It was abandoned.
They found nothing there.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.600
Well, that's because
they didn't know where to look.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.732
What are you going to do to me?

19:16.281 --> 19:19.489
I'm gonna look at your baby
and determine the DOC.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.986
Date of conception.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.569
The ultrasound will tell me when
you got pregnant, give or take a day.

19:24.664 --> 19:29.283
If you got pregnant off the island, then
you and your baby will probably be OK.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.499
But if you got pregnant here...

19:35.508 --> 19:38.841
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.091
When was the last time
you and your husband had sex?

19:42.182 --> 19:45.515
- I would rather not talk about that.
- I know it's personal.

19:45.602 --> 19:49.845
- But if I know when, I can figure...
- Isn't that what the machine will do?

19:49.939 --> 19:53.898
- Yeah.
- Then let's keep walking.

What do you know about her? Did she
have anything besides the flare gun?

23:03.091 --> 23:06.208
Just a book, a fancy radio phone thingy.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.550
Does it work?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.882
Like I'd tell you.

One of you must help.
The rest, clear the way. I need space.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.514
I'll do it.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.143
Wipe away as much of the blood
as you can.

We need to evacuate the air now.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.191

It was the best news
they ever got in their entire life.

because I want to tell you

that you and your husband
got pregnant before you came here.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.958
I'm helping you because
I want to give good news again.

I slept with another man.

...trouble.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.019
We weren't...

26:58.409 --> 27:00.946
And I had a friend.

27:09.003 --> 27:10.959
It was a mistake.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.288
We all make mistakes.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.960
Which way?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.664
Will you help me move this forward?

28:29.834 --> 28:32.325
Why is this room hidden?

28:34.297 --> 28:37.130
- Don't worry about it.
- What is this place?

28:39.927 --> 28:41.508
Tell me.

28:44.140 --> 28:47.098
It's where we brought the women to die.

28:52.607 --> 28:56.816
She's fine. Keep the wound
as clean as you can.

28:57.987 --> 29:02.651
- She should be better in a day.
- A day? Her lung was punctured.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.405
On this island,
the rules are a bit different.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.952
Maybe a day and a half.

- He's one of them.
- So what would you have me do, Charlie?

carry her. How do we bring a prisoner?

How could you respect me
if I didn't try?

30:00.174 --> 30:03.257
How about I take your other eye?
Would you respect that?

30:03.344 --> 30:05.380
Sorry. What?

30:06.722 --> 30:10.590
- Charlie, don't! Charlie, let him go!
- This is a mistake.

30:10.685 --> 30:14.974
- We can't keep letting these people go.
- We gave him our word.

Go on. Get out of here.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.255
The baby isn't Jin's.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.471
We tried to have a baby
back in Korea and couldn't.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.557
And the doctor...

31:04.196 --> 31:06.903
He told me Jin was infertile.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.449
- And then you came here.
- What?

31:11.620 --> 31:14.862
Did you know
that the average male sperm count

31:14.957 --> 31:18.290
is between 60 and 80 million?

31:20.296 --> 31:23.709
But on this island,
it's five times that.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.835
We call that good odds.

- Yes.
- OK. Wanna lift up your shirt a little?

31:36.937 --> 31:38.928
It's cold.

31:41.442 --> 31:43.558
- Will I see the baby?
- Maybe.

31:43.652 --> 31:47.520
It's your first trimester,
so it's a little iffy.

31:47.615 --> 31:52.905
If you don't see a heartbeat,
don't worry about it, it's just early.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.244
How does it work?

31:56.332 --> 31:58.869
Well, I take a measurement of the fetus,

31:58.959 --> 32:02.793
and that will tell us
when your baby was conceived.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.997
And then we'll know who.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.087
You OK?

32:13.724 --> 32:15.715
I lose either way.

32:17.394 --> 32:22.730
If I'm going to live,
that means the baby's not Jin's.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.225
Do you still wanna do this?

32:28.948 --> 32:30.063
Yes.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.818
OK. The moment of truth.

35:20.202 --> 35:23.444
There it is. There's your baby.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.530
You see?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.619
I can see it.

35:34.466 --> 35:38.084
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- It's a little early.

35:38.178 --> 35:42.012
But do you see that little flutter?

35:44.310 --> 35:46.301
That's the heart beating.

35:50.691 --> 35:53.854
It's very strong. It's very healthy.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.405
OK.

36:01.118 --> 36:04.076
You crashed here 90 days ago.

36:05.789 --> 36:11.785
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago, so 53 days.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.465
You got pregnant on the island.

36:22.473 --> 36:25.681
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sun.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.760
I will do everything that I can.

36:39.782 --> 36:41.488
It's Jin's.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.828
So how long do I have?

38:21.508 --> 38:26.298
Most of the women made it into
the middle of their second trimester.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.759
Nobody made to their third.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.635
That gives me two months.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.975
Iam...

38:44.406 --> 38:46.738
...very happy the baby is Jin's.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.942
You gave me good news, Juliet.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.499
It was my pleasure, Sun.

38:56.585 --> 39:00.169
I'm gonna go back inside
and make sure I didn't miss anything.

39:00.255 --> 39:03.622
I don't wanna take the chance
that we didn't cover our tracks.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.177
Do you wanna wait out here?

39:10.599 --> 39:12.590
All right.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.099
Juliet.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.227
Thank you.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.688
Ben, it's 6 AM on Saturday morning.

40:01.108 --> 40:02.598
Kwon is pregnant.

40:02.693 --> 40:06.527
The fetus is healthy and was conceived
on island with her husband.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.569
He was sterile before they got here.

40:08.657 --> 40:11.615
Still working on getting samples
from the other women.

40:11.702 --> 40:15.786
I should have Austen's soon.
I'll report back when I know more.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.787
I hate you.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.095
You can't trust them, you know.

40:34.182 --> 40:36.264
- What's that?
- The Others.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.435
The one you let go, he'll be back
tomorrow with five of his mates.

40:40.522 --> 40:43.138
We should've killed him.

40:43.233 --> 40:46.441
- [Jin] Charlie. Tight.
- [Charlie] OK.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.940
You know, brother,

40:49.031 --> 40:54.401
by my count, you've killed more of them
than they've killed of you.

40:54.494 --> 40:57.782
They started it. Just 'cause
one comes back with Jack and Kate

40:57.873 --> 40:59.955
doesn't mean that we can trust them now.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.429
Mom?

41:23.523 --> 41:26.606
[coughs]

41:26.693 --> 41:28.684
Where am I?

41:29.446 --> 41:31.311
- You had a branch...
- Where am I?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.783
I don't know.

41:33.867 --> 41:37.155
You're on an island.
Are you here to rescue us?

41:37.245 --> 41:39.907
Are there more of you?
Can you make your phone work?

41:39.998 --> 41:42.330
- Who are you?
- Hugo Reyes.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.001
I crashed here on Oceanic Flight 815.
A bunch of us survived.

41:46.088 --> 41:49.000
Is that why you're here?
Were you looking for us?

41:49.925 --> 41:52.337
815?

41:52.427 --> 41:55.009
Flight 815? The one from Sydney?

41:55.097 --> 41:56.758
Yeah.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.468
No. That's not possible.

41:59.559 --> 42:03.677
Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy, but we
found food and a hatch and more food...

42:03.772 --> 42:07.264
Flight 815... They...
They found the plane.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.519
There were no survivors.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.193
They were all dead.

42:21.456 --> 42:22.616
What?
