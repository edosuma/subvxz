Another super spicy
Saturday recorder band practice.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.680
Now hit me with a few bars.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.591
I'd rather save it
for rehearsal.

00:34.684 --> 00:35.868
My lips get tired.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.778
From playing my recorder
so well.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.521
Respect. You know,
there's no telling

00:39.540 --> 00:42.266
what I'll find cleaning
out this Van-iel Radcliffe.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.858
(chuckles): But whatever it is,
I get to keep it.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.693
Quarter roll of duct tape? Mine.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.604
This map of Lone Moose
from before we got the car wash?

00:47.697 --> 00:49.439
All mine, baby!

00:49.458 --> 00:50.624
(chuckles)

00:50.776 --> 00:52.200
See you in 55 minutes.

00:52.294 --> 00:53.627
Have fun with your recorder.

00:53.779 --> 00:57.038
And also, record this:
I love you very much.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.041
(accent):
There's gold in this here van.

01:00.135 --> 01:01.376
All right, kids, huddle up.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.895
Welcome back to Saturday Splits,

01:03.122 --> 01:04.897
where we take a deep dive
into divorce trauma

01:05.124 --> 01:08.141
and those gallon tubs
of ice cream.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.460
We're gonna to kick off today's
processing with a few reps

01:10.479 --> 01:11.553
of free share.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.073
Then, I'll pop in
this instructional DVD

01:14.300 --> 01:16.575
and we'll round this all out
with some delicious,

01:16.802 --> 01:18.243
unstructured banana split time.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.971
-Who'd like to share first?
-RUSSELL: I'll go, Coach Kiely.

01:20.989 --> 01:23.248
I've composed a poem
about and for

01:23.400 --> 01:25.809
my mom's perfect boyfriend
Jamie.

01:25.902 --> 01:28.161
"Not a dad. Not a friend.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.831
Jamie is a man in between."

01:30.925 --> 01:32.758
HONEYBEE:
Thanks for coming with me
to mail my pen pal letters,

01:32.985 --> 01:34.909
-you guys.
-Well, I am happy

01:35.003 --> 01:36.486
to accompany you
to the post office.

01:36.505 --> 01:39.323
I'll run any errands with you.
Of any kind.

01:39.416 --> 01:40.415
At any time.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.916
Because you love my convertible?

01:42.010 --> 01:43.160
(laughs)
What? No.

01:43.178 --> 01:44.328
Convertibles are silly.

01:44.346 --> 01:45.662
And we shouldn't
put the top down.

01:45.681 --> 01:46.847
It's much too cold.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.607
(giggles)

01:48.834 --> 01:50.609
I don't enjoy this.

01:50.794 --> 01:53.112
-I'm not a puppy.
-I would be so embarrassed

01:53.263 --> 01:56.506
if a certain someone saw us
in this beautiful car.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.600
Should we go drive
by Stacy B's house again?

01:58.694 --> 02:00.953
HONEYBEE: Okay, got to mail
these pen pal letters.

02:01.104 --> 02:02.979
This one to Jessica in Decatur
is very important.

02:03.031 --> 02:05.031
The zoning board shut down
her kite-flying camp

02:05.126 --> 02:06.683
because it was too close
to the airport.

02:06.702 --> 02:09.035
I hate seeing someone
get their dream taken away.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.964
Even if that dream is kites
and I don't understand it.

02:12.115 --> 02:15.008
-(screeches)
-(shouts) What the...?

02:15.878 --> 02:17.694
Honeybee, don't move a muscle.

02:17.713 --> 02:18.712
Is this like<i> Jurassic Park?</i>

02:18.864 --> 02:19.954
If I don't move,
it can't see me?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.715
-(screeches)
-(screams)

02:21.867 --> 02:22.883
-Uh-oh! Stay calm.
-Oh, no!

02:23.035 --> 02:24.534
-He got my mitten!
-BEEF: Stay calm.

02:24.553 --> 02:25.477
Coming to get you.

02:25.704 --> 02:27.295
HAM:
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.373
(shouts)
Oh, no, your legs!

02:29.466 --> 02:31.708
Keep driving, I'll get them in!

02:31.727 --> 02:33.210
What the hell was that?

02:33.303 --> 02:36.137
That was Toby the Eagle.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.805
Hey, a purple Skittle!

02:37.900 --> 02:40.308
Mmm, mmm-- Nope, that's a bead.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.885
Moon's recorder?

02:41.904 --> 02:44.479
(stammers) You don't become
first chair in recorder choir

02:44.573 --> 02:45.813
by forgetting your instrument.

02:45.908 --> 02:47.815
You probably become,
like, third chair.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.651
And then maybe quit school?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.912
And run away from home
to live in a skate park?

02:52.064 --> 02:54.247
Oh, no. Moon!

02:54.400 --> 02:55.732
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> I still can't believe</i>

02:55.825 --> 02:57.401
Toby the Eagle got your mitten.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.236
That's below the belt.
At least for me,

02:59.329 --> 03:02.072
-but my arms are pretty long.
-It<i> was</i> below the belt, Ham.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.423
That's why I'm calling
animal control.

03:03.575 --> 03:05.333
Honeybee, you can't.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.353
-Why?
-(sighs) Toby isn't
just any eagle.

03:08.505 --> 03:11.172
He's actually a Lone Moose
city councilperson.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.357
No, he's not, he's a bird.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.175
Toby is, in fact,
a city councilperson.

03:14.195 --> 03:17.437
And Toby's handler Roy
is also a councilperson,

03:17.589 --> 03:20.515
and together they have
a powerful two-thirds majority.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.368
The third councilperson Gwen
just gave up years ago.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.111
These days,
she spends council meetings

03:25.264 --> 03:27.113
practicing picking things up
with her bare feet.

03:27.266 --> 03:29.783
I saw her at the mall using
chopsticks with her toes.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.359
She made it through
a whole lo mein.

03:31.453 --> 03:33.545
If you wrong Toby,
you wrong Roy.

03:33.697 --> 03:35.121
And if you wrong Roy,

03:35.274 --> 03:37.198
pretty soon you find yourself
drowning in parking tickets

03:37.218 --> 03:40.535
and maybe even
Toby's extra-large birdbath

03:40.629 --> 03:41.945
behind city hall.

03:41.964 --> 03:43.447
Dad, we've been over this.

03:43.465 --> 03:45.724
You fell in.
Nobody was even there.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.208
I have my doubts.

03:47.377 --> 03:50.787
Being a city councilperson
is a person job, not a bird job.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.457
-What is wrong with this town?
-It's not just Lone Moose.

03:53.517 --> 03:54.733
Having an animal
in the government

03:54.884 --> 03:56.050
is a thing in Alaska.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.885
Talkeetna has a cat mayor
named Cat Damon.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.131
Oh, and he has a little chicken
friend named Hen Affleck.

04:01.224 --> 04:03.408
It's usually just a novelty
meant to sell postcards,

04:03.635 --> 04:06.411
but Toby the Eagle
has actual power.

04:06.563 --> 04:08.580
Someone needs to speak up
about this.

04:08.732 --> 04:09.748
Oh, I've tried.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.157
A few years ago,
I was standing outside

04:11.310 --> 04:13.067
one of my all-time favorite
establishments,

04:13.161 --> 04:14.902
the Yoghurt Yhurt,

04:14.997 --> 04:19.073
<i>when, citing an OSHA violation,</i>
<i>Roy shut down the Yhurt forever.</i>

04:19.167 --> 04:20.500
<i> But a few months later,</i>

04:20.652 --> 04:23.336
<i> a shop selling nothing</i>
<i> but eagle paraphernalia</i>

04:23.489 --> 04:25.747
<i> was allowed to open</i>
<i> in the very same spot.</i>

04:25.841 --> 04:28.158
<i> I decided to squash</i>
<i> the corruption from within,</i>

04:28.176 --> 04:29.917
<i> by running for city council.</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:31.603
<i> Because I lived</i>
<i> in Toby's district,</i>

04:31.830 --> 04:33.605
<i> I had to run against the bird.</i>

04:33.757 --> 04:35.923
<i> I thought it would be</i>
<i> pretty easy, but then</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.334
<i> it came time for the debate.</i>

04:37.427 --> 04:38.777
Back to what I was trying to say

04:38.928 --> 04:40.112
-about gutter repair.
-(screeching)

04:40.263 --> 04:41.780
The safety of our gutters...

04:41.931 --> 04:45.450
<i>Every time I would try to speak,</i>
<i> he would shriek over me.</i>

04:45.602 --> 04:46.860
<i> The crowd loved it.</i>

04:47.012 --> 04:48.787
I like when the eagle shrieks.

04:48.938 --> 04:50.122
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> People always vote for the guy</i>

04:50.273 --> 04:51.456
<i> they want to have a beer with.</i>

04:51.608 --> 04:53.517
And that guy was Toby the Eagle.

04:53.535 --> 04:55.294
Well, if we can't get
the eagle off the council,

04:55.445 --> 04:58.188
maybe I could at least get
my mitten back from his nest?

04:58.206 --> 04:59.631
Well, good luck with that.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.875
When Toby stole Zoya's wig
at the Fall Frenzy Dance,

05:02.027 --> 05:04.136
Roy claimed
he'd bought the wig for Toby.

05:04.287 --> 05:06.046
(groans)
That bird runs this town.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.547
Well, I'm not taking this
lying down.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.366
I can't walk around
with just one mitten on.

05:09.459 --> 05:10.642
I'm gonna make Roy a gift basket

05:10.794 --> 05:12.460
with some of my dad's
chocolate fudge in it

05:12.479 --> 05:14.704
and politely ask him
to get my mitten back.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.315
My dad always used to say,

05:16.542 --> 05:19.300
"Once they taste that fudge,
they can't hold a grudge."

05:19.394 --> 05:20.727
<i> BETHANY:</i>
<i> My parents are technically</i>

05:20.879 --> 05:22.321
still happily married,

05:22.472 --> 05:24.714
but my mom started
DVR-ing<i> Dateline,</i>

05:24.808 --> 05:26.716
so I feel that she's
going to kill my dad.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.160
Sorry, Bethany.

05:28.311 --> 05:29.811
-Moon? Your turn.
-Oh.

05:29.905 --> 05:32.739
I'm still very upset
about divorce.

05:32.891 --> 05:35.983
And the only thing that makes me
feel better is ice cream,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.061
so why don't we crack open
those tubs and...

05:38.080 --> 05:39.729
Well, not quite yet.

05:39.748 --> 05:42.507

Hi, everybody,
I'm actress Lisa Rinna.

05:59.008 --> 06:02.176
I've been happily married for
25 years to Mr. Harry Hamlin,

06:02.196 --> 06:04.270
but my character Taylor's
divorce from Kyle McBride

06:04.365 --> 06:05.864
in season six of<i> Melrose Place</i>

06:06.015 --> 06:07.607
was one of the hardest things
I've ever gone through.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.110
But it taught me
that while divorce is painful,

06:10.262 --> 06:11.444
it's not always bad.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.097
Just like this banana
that is split in two.

06:14.116 --> 06:16.116
The splitting of your parents
may be the very thing

06:16.268 --> 06:19.119
which creates space
for all the good in life:

06:19.271 --> 06:22.439
the ice cream, the whipped
cream, and of course,

06:22.532 --> 06:24.274
the cherry on top.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.610
Mmm. Now, that's good.

06:26.628 --> 06:29.596
(cries)
That's frickin' beautiful, Lisa.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.117
I'm sorry for lying to you about

06:34.119 --> 06:35.785
this ice cream-based
divorce club.

06:36.121 --> 06:37.621
Don't be sorry.
I just don't know why

06:37.714 --> 06:39.564
you'd hide something
this amazing from me.

06:39.791 --> 06:43.217
Sundaes, emotional deep dives,
Coach Regina Kiely?

06:43.237 --> 06:44.569
This club has everything.

06:44.721 --> 06:46.721
I mainly didn't tell you
because I thought if Dad

06:46.815 --> 06:48.890
learned about my gigantic
helping of ice cream here,

06:48.909 --> 06:52.485
he might not give me my gigantic
helping of ice cream at home.

06:52.638 --> 06:54.079
I would never let that happen
to you.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.472
But also, you can talk to me

06:55.565 --> 06:57.307
about Mom and Dad's divorce
anytime.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.992
-I'm here for you.
-Thanks.

06:59.144 --> 07:01.420
But again, I only do it
for the ice cream.

07:01.571 --> 07:04.648
Yeah, sure.
Just like how I only watch

07:04.741 --> 07:06.574
<i> Quebec's Quiche Queens</i>
because Honeybee likes it.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.835
But if I happen to be
taking a master class

07:08.987 --> 07:11.988
in Canadian female friendship
along the way, so be it.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.657
Are you two Tobins
doing okay out here?

07:13.675 --> 07:16.584
Sorry for getting so emotional
in your doorframe earlier.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.437
Don't be sorry. Mm-mm.

07:18.588 --> 07:21.181
Even if you're an adult,
you're still a child of divorce.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.108
Why don't you come on in,
grab a split,

07:23.259 --> 07:24.926
and stay for the wrap-up song?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.670
It's "Believe" by Cher.

<i> Well, hi, there.</i>

07:34.029 --> 07:35.954
I'm just hoping
to see Councilman Roy.

07:36.181 --> 07:37.605
-He's right there.
-Stephanie?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.623
Did you check the schedule?

07:38.775 --> 07:40.517
-You're wide open.
-Great.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.869
-How can I help you, ma'am?
-Well, your bird...

07:43.021 --> 07:44.688
-Toby.
-Yes. Toby.

07:44.706 --> 07:46.965
He stole some items from me,
including my pen pal letters,

07:47.116 --> 07:49.693
which I believe he mostly ate,
and a single mitten,

07:49.786 --> 07:51.303
which I would like to get back.

07:51.454 --> 07:53.363
I see. You have
a formal complaint

07:53.381 --> 07:54.881
against a fellow councilperson.

07:55.033 --> 07:58.201
Business like that is addressed
during our council meetings.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.145
But your bird stole from me.

08:00.296 --> 08:01.705
I saw my mitten
in the nest outside.

08:01.798 --> 08:03.965
I just want you to get it back
from your pet.

08:04.059 --> 08:07.319
If you are requesting something
of monetary value from the city,

08:07.470 --> 08:10.304
you can fill out a request form
and, again,

08:10.324 --> 08:11.881
bring it to the council meeting.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.233
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:13.385 --> 08:15.660
I have to concentrate
really hard when I write,

08:15.812 --> 08:17.570
or my writing is illegible.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.406
Okay, well. Here's a basket
with grudge fudge.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.892
-I cannot accept this bribe.
-It's not a bribe.

08:22.911 --> 08:25.170
-(shouts) Forget it. Forget it!
-I won't forget it.

08:25.321 --> 08:27.005
I'm writing down
a note here on my pad,

08:27.156 --> 08:30.050
and I'll speak to you about it
at the council meeting.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.344
(screeches)

08:32.495 --> 08:35.013
Oh, no, oh, no. Help! My basket!

08:35.164 --> 08:37.407
All right, Toby. I give up.

08:37.425 --> 08:39.242
I can't kill you with kindness
and I can't kill you

08:39.335 --> 08:41.019
with anything else,
because you're<i> endangered.</i>

08:41.170 --> 08:43.580
So I'm gonna go home and watch
<i> Quebec's Quiche Q--</i>

08:43.673 --> 08:46.599
<i> Quebec's Quiche Queens</i>
until I calm down.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.176
It's impossible to say
and impossible to turn off.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.012
<i> KIELY:</i>
<i> Can anyone answer</i>

08:51.031 --> 08:52.939
question one:
"What is this a picture of?"

08:53.091 --> 08:55.258
Oh, I can answer that one
for you, Coach Kiely.

08:55.277 --> 08:56.517
That's a mom who's dating again.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.611
And that kid's feeling
extremely bad

08:58.764 --> 09:01.614
'cause his whole family sitch
is about to go kablammo.

09:01.767 --> 09:03.708
Yeah, it happened
to me and Moon, am I right?

09:03.860 --> 09:05.118
-Mm.
-Moon's just being quiet

09:05.270 --> 09:06.436
because he's avoiding the truth

09:06.529 --> 09:08.438
about how devastatingly upset
he is.

09:08.456 --> 09:09.956
He's like Meryl Streep's
character in<i> Doubt.</i>

09:10.108 --> 09:11.608
Sister Aloysius?

09:11.626 --> 09:13.276
(chuckles):
Has no one here seen<i> Doubt?</i>

09:13.295 --> 09:14.886
Yes. I watch it
every year on my birthday.

09:14.996 --> 09:18.615
All I'm saying is, you got
to face the hard stuff head-on.

09:18.633 --> 09:22.043
Otherwise one day...
(imitates explosion)

09:22.062 --> 09:23.953
you'll just explode.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.212
(whimpers)
I don't want to explode.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.290
No, no, no, you're safe.
You're safe, Russell.

09:27.309 --> 09:30.217
Wolf, as the other adult here,
I was wondering

09:30.237 --> 09:32.145
if you might help me
set up our next activity?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.573
Oh, fo sho. Moon, don't worry.

09:34.724 --> 09:37.467
I'm just gonna be up there at
the board helping Coach Kiely.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.469
I am not abandoning you
like Mom did.

09:39.487 --> 09:43.064
Oh, good. But if you did want
to wait in the car till we're...

09:43.158 --> 09:45.417
I'm here, buddy. I'm here.

09:45.568 --> 09:47.143
HONEYBEE:
All right.

09:47.162 --> 09:49.403
It looks like the eagle
has landed. Somewhere else.

09:49.497 --> 09:52.165
-I'm just gonna go mail
my rewritten letters.
-Okay.

09:52.317 --> 09:54.426
I'll just enjoy my seat heater
while you're gone.

09:54.577 --> 09:56.911
I know there's not
a tiny campfire in here,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.838
but I sure have fun
pretending there is.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.506
Could I bother you
for a roll of stamps?

10:00.601 --> 10:03.009
And if you have any fun ones,
like Beach Snoopy

10:03.103 --> 10:04.919
or a hamburger with eyeballs,

10:05.013 --> 10:06.329
I could really use a pick-me-up.

10:06.422 --> 10:08.440
We only carry
bald eagle Forever Stamps.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.333
-Of course you do.
-I was able to overhear

10:10.426 --> 10:11.851
your little chat with Roy
the other day.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.686
Because I was
actively eavesdropping.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.948
You must be pretty mad
about Toby taking your stuff.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.341
Oh, girl, no!

10:18.434 --> 10:20.343
I thought about it,
and, uh, I love it.

10:20.478 --> 10:21.953
Roy and Toby went home already.

10:22.105 --> 10:24.180
Well, then yeah! I'm furious!

10:24.199 --> 10:25.272
But what can I do?

10:25.367 --> 10:26.791
I know exactly what you can do.

10:26.943 --> 10:28.460
So, there's no rule
preventing an animal

10:28.653 --> 10:30.854
from holding a city council seat
here in Lone Moose.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.797
But there is
a minimum age required

10:32.949 --> 10:35.208
of anyone in Toby's position:
18.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.877
But get this--
the average eagle's lifespan

10:38.029 --> 10:39.137
is only 18 years.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.547
And I suspect
Toby is an early adolescent,

10:41.700 --> 10:43.049
based on his talon size.

10:43.201 --> 10:44.384
And his constant masturbation.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.386
Toby is in violation
of town code?

10:46.538 --> 10:47.628
Exactamundo.

10:47.797 --> 10:50.649
Bring this to Roy
and demand that Toby steps down.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.966
I would've done it years ago,

10:51.985 --> 10:53.559
but it's political suicide

10:53.712 --> 10:55.211
and I have dreams.

10:55.304 --> 10:56.729
To put it simply,
I would like to be

10:56.823 --> 10:58.731
president of the United States.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.550
You didn't get me
my mitten back, Roy.

11:00.568 --> 11:03.236
So now... (whispers):
I'm coming for your bird.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.664
Ooh, I just gave myself chills.

11:05.891 --> 11:08.500
So, you'll write something
that<i> actually</i> contributed

11:08.651 --> 11:10.243
to your parents' split,

11:10.337 --> 11:11.394
because it-- say it with me...

11:11.413 --> 11:13.672
-OTHERS: Wasn't my fault.
-Correct.

11:13.781 --> 11:15.581
For instance, in my divorce,

11:15.734 --> 11:18.492
it's not my fault that Samantha
and I had different ideas

11:18.586 --> 11:20.069
about saving money.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.514
So, I might write "money."

11:22.741 --> 11:25.517
Samantha also refused
to eat peas like a normal woman

11:25.744 --> 11:27.744
and instead would bring
the whole plate--

11:27.762 --> 11:29.503
the whole plate-- up to her lips

11:29.523 --> 11:31.690
and roll them
into her open mouth.

11:31.841 --> 11:34.934
So, I also might write "peas."

11:35.086 --> 11:36.252
(inhales deeply, sighs)

11:36.271 --> 11:37.511
Debbie, why don't you start?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.847
Okay. My dad quit his job
to record an album

11:39.866 --> 11:41.090
called<i> Simply Ken.</i>

11:41.184 --> 11:42.108
And, now, here I am.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.868
Well, let's see. Uh...

11:44.095 --> 11:45.278
It was totally not my fault.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.706
My mom-- also Moon's mom--
just met another guy.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.615
At the dance studio
in Death Cliff.

11:49.768 --> 11:51.859
He was actually<i> my</i> instructor,
Marcus.

11:51.878 --> 11:52.936
And I introduced them.

11:53.029 --> 11:54.787
On the evening
of my first recital.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.697
<i> I remember standing backstage.</i>

11:56.717 --> 11:59.867
<i> But I didn't even get</i>
<i> to perform, because I saw...</i>

11:59.961 --> 12:00.868
Mom?

12:00.962 --> 12:02.536
And Marcus?

12:02.630 --> 12:05.873
Kissing?!
(wailing)

12:05.967 --> 12:07.467
Paul Simon's Pee-Pee!

12:07.619 --> 12:09.060
It<i> was</i> my fault!

12:12.048 --> 12:13.565
(crying, chewing)

12:14.309 --> 12:15.959
It<i> was</i> all my fault.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.235
This club is a lie.

12:17.386 --> 12:19.479
And this banana split
is a lie banana split.

12:19.631 --> 12:22.389
Wolf, I can see that you're in,
uh, a lot of pain.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.650
But you're scaring everyone.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.227
Russell's day terrors are back.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.728
-(Russell shrieks)
-I'm sorry,

12:27.748 --> 12:29.247
but I have to ask you to leave.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.491
But what about Moon?
He really needs me in there.

12:31.643 --> 12:33.084
I don't think
you can help your brother

12:33.311 --> 12:34.494
till you help yourself, Wolf.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.087
Okay. I understand.

12:36.239 --> 12:39.424
May I make myself a
replacement banana split to go?

12:39.651 --> 12:41.408
Okay, I'm going.

12:41.503 --> 12:44.912
♪<i> I can feel something</i>
<i> inside me say</i> ♪

12:44.931 --> 12:49.158
♪<i> I really don't think</i>
<i> Wolf's strong enough, oh!</i> ♪

12:49.177 --> 12:52.328
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> Uh, no, Ham,</i>
<i> it doesn't come like that.</i>

12:52.347 --> 12:55.832
I make the bacon into
a little smile on the pancake.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.184
What about the French toast
with the strawberry lips?

12:58.336 --> 13:00.761
Are you asking me
if the toast has lips, son?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.389
-Morning, Honeybee.
Where's Wolf?
-He's in the guesthouse.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.116
He's upset,
but I don't know what's wrong.

13:05.343 --> 13:07.401
He said it had something to do
with cleaning out the van.

13:07.512 --> 13:09.679
I bet he found an old
English muffin and ate it again

13:09.697 --> 13:12.031
and doesn't want to tell me
he has diarrhea.

13:12.183 --> 13:13.182
I'll go check on him.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.459
All right,
I'm off to confront Roy.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.020
We'd better come with you.
You know, as backup.

13:17.038 --> 13:19.280
Also, maybe I want Mr. Wind

13:19.299 --> 13:22.425
to run his fingers
through my hair again.

13:23.286 --> 13:25.378
-Wolf?
-Oh, hey, Moon.

13:25.530 --> 13:28.214
You can tell Coach Kiely
that I can buy my own ice cream,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.033
'cause I'm a big boy with money.

13:30.051 --> 13:31.551
I probably won't tell her that.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.813
-Hey, do you maybe want
to go do something?
-Why?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.964
I'll just end up ruining
something perfect.

13:37.058 --> 13:38.483
Like I ruined
Mom and Dad's marriage

13:38.634 --> 13:39.876
and your divorce club

13:39.894 --> 13:40.968
and these pajamas.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.636
Okay. But the thing is,

13:42.656 --> 13:45.565
in health class, they told us we
need to start wearing deodorant,

13:45.659 --> 13:48.901
so I need to go to
the drug store in Death Cliff.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.144
Oh, Drug Cliff?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.571
They have
a sick ibuprofen selection.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.058
Yeah. Dad's busy, so I
was hoping you could take me.

13:55.151 --> 13:56.242
Okay, fine.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.061
But I'm not changing out
of these pajamas.

13:58.079 --> 13:59.412
Not for anyone. Ever.

13:59.564 --> 14:01.747
Except maybe for Barack Obama,
if he were to ask.

14:01.842 --> 14:02.748
Or Michelle.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.509
Or Malia. Or Sasha.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.070
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,

14:07.088 --> 14:09.922
honk the horn three times and
drive through his front door.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.516
Or we could come with you.

14:11.667 --> 14:14.185
Thanks, Beef, but this is
between the bird and the bee.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.669
And the Roy.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.689
Oh, you guys want to play
Action Movie while we wait?

14:17.840 --> 14:20.766
Way ahead of you!
(grunting)

14:20.861 --> 14:23.269
ROY:
Ooh, I hear someone outside.

14:23.421 --> 14:25.012
Must be your birthday present
getting delivered,

14:25.031 --> 14:27.090
my handsome Tobe-lerone.

14:27.183 --> 14:28.107
Oh, it's you.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.259
You've been a bad boy, Roy.

14:30.278 --> 14:31.594
Don't mind the filing cabinets.

14:31.613 --> 14:34.021
I feel it's important
to keep paper copies

14:34.115 --> 14:35.522
of all the town budgets
because...

14:35.542 --> 14:37.208
(whispers):
what if they hack the server?

14:37.360 --> 14:38.618
What if who hacks the server?

14:38.770 --> 14:41.212
Well, there are
a lot of threats out there.

14:41.439 --> 14:42.788
Like, I don't know what it is,

14:42.941 --> 14:45.199
but I keep hearing
about<i> Mario Kart?</i>

14:45.293 --> 14:47.293
Well, I just came
to show you this.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.946
Toby's too young
to hold office. Legally.

14:50.039 --> 14:52.115
Either he steps down
or I go public.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.950
Oh, no. What have I done?

14:54.043 --> 14:56.469
I'm so sorry
to the people of Lone Moose.

14:56.621 --> 14:57.562
Uh, they trusted us.

14:57.789 --> 14:59.455
And I'm sorry to you.

14:59.548 --> 15:01.290
I never wanted
to violate town code.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.234
-So you knew?
-Of course I knew.

15:03.386 --> 15:05.904
I have that book memorized.
I-I love town code.

15:06.055 --> 15:07.388
More than anything in the world.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.740
Well, except Toby.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.484
If you love it so much,
why'd you break the code, Roy?

15:11.636 --> 15:13.986
(sighs) I've always wanted
to work on the council.

15:14.139 --> 15:15.638
Ever since I was a little boy.

15:15.731 --> 15:16.989
But people wouldn't elect me.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.158
They found me dry or boring.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.901
After a couple failed campaigns,

15:20.995 --> 15:23.421
I gave up my dreams
and moved out here.

15:23.648 --> 15:25.256
And that's when
I was first attacked by Toby.

15:25.483 --> 15:27.667
But then, much later,
he befriended me.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.094
Because I left out
a ton of meat for him.

15:30.246 --> 15:32.079
Then I read about a guinea pig
who was

15:32.098 --> 15:33.506
Alaska's lieutenant governor

15:33.600 --> 15:34.748
-in the 1950s...
-Wait,

15:34.884 --> 15:37.101
a guinea pig
was lieutenant governor?

15:37.253 --> 15:38.269
Eh, for a brief time.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.012
He died in office.
He overheated.

15:40.165 --> 15:42.014
You're really not supposed
to put them in little suits.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.516
But inspiration struck.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.610
I put Toby on the ticket with me
and, voilà,

15:45.837 --> 15:49.280
I wasn't just the boring guy
with the plan for sewage reform.

15:49.432 --> 15:52.175
I was the boring guy
with the plan for sewage reform

15:52.193 --> 15:53.451
and the eagle. We won!

15:53.602 --> 15:56.345
All I ever wanted to do
was help this town.

15:56.439 --> 15:58.181
And be best friends
with an eagle.

15:58.274 --> 15:59.457
And I was living the dream.

15:59.608 --> 16:01.960
But I guess
we flew too close to the sun.

16:02.111 --> 16:03.686
I mean, he did. I-I can't fly.

16:03.705 --> 16:06.189
Toby and I will resign
at the council meeting.

16:06.282 --> 16:08.466
-(screech)
-We won't work together anymore,

16:08.693 --> 16:10.209
but he'll still be my guy.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.878
HONEYBEE: You really do
love that bird, huh?

16:13.031 --> 16:14.305
He's my best friend.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.140
My only friend.

16:16.292 --> 16:17.475
But rules are rules.

16:17.626 --> 16:19.644
At least I lived my dream
for a little while.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.145
You got me fair and square.

16:21.297 --> 16:22.872
(quietly):
Oh, my God. I'm a dream killer.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.631
I'm taking away
this man's kite camp.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.650
Hold on.

16:25.801 --> 16:27.560
Roy, if there's one thing
I don't do,

16:27.712 --> 16:29.045
it's steal people's dreams.

16:29.063 --> 16:30.304
If I can help you fix
this problem,

16:30.323 --> 16:32.323
can you get my mitten back
from Toby's nest?

16:32.550 --> 16:33.307
He might bite me.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.401
Like, a lot. But I can try.

16:35.553 --> 16:36.995
Let me look
at that town code real quick.

16:37.222 --> 16:38.812
-(horn honking)
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

16:38.832 --> 16:40.147
Don't drive into the house,
guys!

16:40.241 --> 16:41.574
We're kind of friends now!

16:41.668 --> 16:43.726
<i> WOLF: All right,</i>
<i>time to get you some deodorant.</i>

16:43.819 --> 16:45.745
<i> And I might treat myself to</i>
<i>a tiny little bottle of shampoo.</i>

16:45.839 --> 16:49.565
I love to imagine I'm a giant
who's washing his hair.

16:49.584 --> 16:52.235
Wolf,
I don't actually need deodorant.

16:52.328 --> 16:55.179
I brought you here
to deal with your past.

16:55.331 --> 16:56.347
WOLF:
Oh, no! I forgot

16:56.499 --> 16:58.499
the ding dang dance studio
was here!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.059
Mambo number crap!

17:04.265 --> 17:05.765
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No way. No, no, no, no.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.008
Wolf, this is what the Saturday
Splits is all about.

17:08.102 --> 17:10.194
The only way to deal
with your empty heart bowl

17:10.346 --> 17:12.772
is to fill it up
with the creamy truth.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.423
(sighs)
You're right, Moon.

17:14.517 --> 17:15.849
Let's get to scoopin'.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.444
-(bell tinkles)
-Hello. Sorry to
bother you, ma'am.

17:18.596 --> 17:20.371
Mary. Are you here
for Dubstep Delight?

17:20.598 --> 17:22.765
Because Lace broke both
his knees, so it's canceled.

17:22.784 --> 17:25.043
Actually, we're just hoping
to sort some events

17:25.194 --> 17:26.602
that took place here
a few years ago.

17:26.621 --> 17:28.120
-My brother, Wolf Tobin...
-Tobin?

17:28.273 --> 17:29.972
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

17:29.974 --> 17:30.956
You're Kathleen's kid.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.942
My husband Marcus left me
for your mom.

17:33.035 --> 17:34.201
Oh, my God.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.294
So that makes you...

17:35.446 --> 17:36.220
my mother?!

17:36.447 --> 17:37.538
Oh, no, sorry.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.465
It just means
I ruined your marriage, too.

17:39.617 --> 17:42.118
And when he left, he saddled me
with this dance studio.

17:42.136 --> 17:43.469
And I can't even dance.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.878
Look.
(grunting)

17:44.898 --> 17:47.473
This is genuinely the best
I can dance.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.566
I'm so sorry.

17:48.793 --> 17:50.234
My selfish desire to learn tap

17:50.386 --> 17:52.052
ruined so many lives.

17:52.146 --> 17:54.363
I'm gonna go stand by the car.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.076
Wolf. Wolf! Look at this.

17:58.227 --> 17:59.393
Oh. "Boomfunk!"

17:59.412 --> 18:00.636
(chuckles)
That's fun to say.

18:00.729 --> 18:02.321
No, Wolf, look at the picture.

18:02.473 --> 18:04.916
Oh, my<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>
That's...

18:05.067 --> 18:06.567
-MOON: Mom.
-And, wait,

18:06.694 --> 18:09.312
this picture is from way before
I ever took that tap class here.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.571
So if Mom was here<i> then,</i>

18:10.706 --> 18:12.573
I guess I didn't introduce her
to Marcus.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.576
Yeah, they were running around
for years, and everyone knew it.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.244
Except me, ole Mary.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.155
This is amazing news!

18:19.173 --> 18:20.414
And also very upsetting.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.824
I'm very sorry
about your marriage, Mary.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.676
But this means
it wasn't my fault!

18:23.828 --> 18:26.345
It wouldn't have been
your fault either way, Wolf.

18:26.497 --> 18:28.998
Even if you had introduced
Mom and Marcus,

18:29.016 --> 18:31.350
this was 100% their fault.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.852
And, honestly, I'm kind of glad

18:33.004 --> 18:34.503
I don't have to deal
with Marcus anymore.

18:34.597 --> 18:37.115
His fedora collection
took up the entire bathroom.

18:37.266 --> 18:38.674
We got in so many fights

18:38.693 --> 18:41.268
because I would
accidentally poop in his hats.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.362
Moon, thank you
for bringing me here.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.456
Gosh, I'm so friggin' impressed
by you.

18:45.608 --> 18:48.609
You're mature and thoughtful
and smart and stuff.

18:48.703 --> 18:50.444
I mean, it's insane
you turned out that way,

18:50.463 --> 18:52.946
given what a frang dang mess
our family is.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.025
Wolf, I wasn't lying when I said
I only go to Saturday Splits

18:56.043 --> 18:57.193
for the ice cream.

18:57.286 --> 18:58.619
My childhood has been wonderful.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.788
I've always felt like I have
two pretty great parents,

19:01.883 --> 19:03.457
Dad and... you.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.309
I mean, you taught me
how to cartwheel.

19:05.461 --> 19:07.812
-Brag.
-How to double-dip a French fry

19:07.963 --> 19:09.538
without contaminating
the ketchup.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.540
And, just today,
you dropped everything

19:11.559 --> 19:13.726
to drive me out here
to buy deodorant.

19:13.878 --> 19:14.560
I love you, Moon.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.045
Love you, too, Wolf.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.638
Whew. (chuckles)
You know what?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.899
It might actually be time
to get that deodorant.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.050
That's probably me.

19:21.143 --> 19:22.660
It has been a morning.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.387
Moon, if it's okay with you,

19:24.447 --> 19:26.980
I think there's one more thing
I need to take care of

19:27.000 --> 19:28.532
before we leave.

19:28.685 --> 19:30.501
Okay! You guys ready?

19:30.653 --> 19:31.985
Mary, count us in!

19:32.005 --> 19:33.746
One, two, three, four.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.112
(sighs) Well, if there are
no constituents present...

20:07.207 --> 20:12.043
Hello! We're here to talk
about town code section 14.c58.

20:12.194 --> 20:14.103
"Human and other types
of children

20:14.121 --> 20:15.938
aren't allowed to hold office"?

20:16.031 --> 20:17.273
That seems wrong.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.199
Kids are capable
of great things.

20:19.293 --> 20:20.867
What about Greta Thunberg?

20:20.887 --> 20:21.902
And Malala?

20:21.904 --> 20:22.887
And what about Cupid?

20:23.038 --> 20:24.447
You like falling in love, right?

20:24.465 --> 20:27.058
Anybody who has a dream
should at least get a chance

20:27.209 --> 20:28.375
to live that dream.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.453
Including children
and children eagles.

20:30.546 --> 20:32.230
And, therefore, I hereby propose

20:32.381 --> 20:34.732
the following changes
to the town code.

20:35.643 --> 20:36.901
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> I will say,</i>

20:37.052 --> 20:39.295
Coach Kiely has nothing
on your toppings game.

20:39.313 --> 20:41.146
Well, she's not
the only life advice-based

20:41.299 --> 20:43.056
ice cream club in town.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.483
Now, we have a lot
to get through.

20:44.635 --> 20:47.060
First, pretty soon, you're
gonna have to start shaving.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.305
And the answer is, yes,
buy a lady razor.

20:49.323 --> 20:51.082
They come with lotion strips.

20:51.309 --> 20:52.899
Why deprive yourself of that?

20:52.994 --> 20:54.326
Also, here's something else--

20:54.479 --> 20:57.480
you don't have to measure
every foot-long sub you buy.

20:57.498 --> 20:59.423
