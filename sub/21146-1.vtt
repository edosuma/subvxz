WEBVTT

00:20.730 --> 00:23.858
Seventy million circumcisions every year.

00:24.109 --> 00:26.444
That they report.
And that's just in this country.

00:26.528 --> 00:27.529
Think about that.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.572
You know what, Cassidy? I don't want to.

00:29.781 --> 00:31.991
Seventy million baby boys' foreskins, right?

00:32.283 --> 00:34.327
Severed, harvested, piled up.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.787
Shoveled into bloody warehouses,

00:35.912 --> 00:37.622
and you don't wanna know
what they're using them for.

00:37.747 --> 00:38.748
Who's the "they," Cassidy?

00:38.873 --> 00:39.874
The oligarchs.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.668
It's big business.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.295
Hey, this guy of yours
we're gonna go see, what's his deal?

00:45.130 --> 00:46.631
Mike's an old family friend.

00:47.424 --> 00:49.801
If we're looking for God,
seems like a good place to start.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.970
So, he's like a God detective, right?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.680
Like, some kind of spirit tracker,

00:53.805 --> 00:55.473
bounty hunter kind of family friend?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.435
He's a religious scholar.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.395
Just reads a lot.

01:00.687 --> 01:01.688
Huh.

01:02.313 --> 01:05.984
Well, that sounds like a fun place to start.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.652
Skin grafts. Skin grafts.

01:07.861 --> 01:10.238
We know they're putting
foreskin in skin grafts.

01:10.363 --> 01:11.906
It was on the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show.</i>

01:11.990 --> 01:14.909
And they're putting it into
the face creams you all use, the girls.

01:14.993 --> 01:17.328
Hold up. They do not put
foreskins in face creams.

01:17.454 --> 01:20.331
Yes, they do. It helps bloody
collagen or something like that.

01:20.457 --> 01:22.125
Cassidy, that is a lie.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.628
You'd feel those itty-bitty foreskins on you.

01:25.712 --> 01:29.257
What you feel is smoother,
younger-seeming skin. See?

01:29.340 --> 01:32.010
And that's how they hook you.
Just gotta think about it.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.140
- You do have nice skin.
- Shut up.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.195
This is such a bad song.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.030
Shite.

02:01.873 --> 02:03.291
<i>Come on, Eileen...</i>

02:16.221 --> 02:18.389
Bollocks, I just lit this.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.475
How fast were you going?

02:20.558 --> 02:21.643
Ninety-seven.

02:21.726 --> 02:22.811
It's cool.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.729
I'll just pull over

02:24.813 --> 02:27.106
and do my Afghan war vet thing.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.653
Yeah, you could do that.

02:32.654 --> 02:33.988
Seriously?

02:34.864 --> 02:36.407
It's up to you.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.535
We're low on gas.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.495
Don't do it then.

02:48.253 --> 02:49.420
I love a car chase.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.047
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

02:51.339 --> 02:53.299
<i>Oh, I swear
What he means</i>

02:53.383 --> 02:54.717
<i>At this moment</i>

02:55.635 --> 02:57.595
<i>You mean everything</i>

02:58.763 --> 03:01.933
<i>You in that dress
Oh, I swear, I confess</i>

03:02.016 --> 03:04.018
<i>Verge on dirty</i>

03:04.227 --> 03:06.855
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

03:15.280 --> 03:17.198
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

03:24.789 --> 03:26.791
<i>And you'll hum this tune forever</i>

03:30.712 --> 03:31.713
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

03:31.880 --> 03:33.965
<i>Oh, I swear
What he means</i>

03:34.048 --> 03:35.633
<i>At this moment</i>

03:36.009 --> 03:38.303
<i>You mean everything</i>

03:38.803 --> 03:39.804
<i>You in that dress</i>

03:39.971 --> 03:41.890
<i>My thoughts, I confess</i>

03:42.015 --> 03:43.892
<i>Verge on dirty</i>

03:43.975 --> 03:45.852
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

03:47.478 --> 03:48.813
It's a good song.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.482
Yeah. It's all right.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.704
- You happy now?
- Getting there.

04:04.913 --> 04:06.289
You're cute.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.874
Wanna go out some time?

04:08.166 --> 04:09.208
I'd like that.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.961
Get out of the car!

04:13.129 --> 04:15.173
There's gonna be a plan, right?

04:15.715 --> 04:16.841
Sure.

04:18.551 --> 04:19.761
All right, freak.

04:20.053 --> 04:21.721
Drop the grass and the umbrella, right now.

04:21.846 --> 04:22.847
Mmm-hmm.

04:23.056 --> 04:25.934
But I need the umbrella,
otherwise I burst into flames, see?

04:26.225 --> 04:27.769
Drop the umbrella. Now!

04:27.852 --> 04:29.145
All right, well...

04:29.646 --> 04:30.772
All right, let me just get me thing...

04:30.855 --> 04:32.190
No, hands! Hands!

04:32.273 --> 04:33.566
- Let me see your hands!
- Just relax.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.276
- I'm just gonna grab me sunscreen.
- Let me see!

04:35.360 --> 04:37.236
I just wanna grab my...

04:39.322 --> 04:40.281
Give me your hands!

04:40.365 --> 04:41.366
You bastard!

04:46.537 --> 04:48.373
- Keep your hands in there.
- Hey, be careful, be careful.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.625
- Thanks ever so much.
- 'Course. Anytime.

04:50.708 --> 04:51.709
Nice bloke.

04:51.876 --> 04:52.919
What the hell are you doing?

04:53.920 --> 04:55.338
But he said he'd catch fire.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.632
Idiot...

05:03.096 --> 05:05.098
Guess he was telling the truth
about needing that umbrella, huh?

05:19.237 --> 05:20.613
Come on out here, boy.

05:20.947 --> 05:24.075
Wanna ask y'all some questions,
out here in the sunshine.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.201
No, no, no.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.078
- Don't. Don't.
- Stop.

05:30.081 --> 05:31.457
Holster your guns.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.419
- The hell'd you just say?
- Shut your mouth!

05:35.753 --> 05:37.088
Step over there.

05:43.261 --> 05:44.387
You.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.431
Gas up our car.

05:48.099 --> 05:49.267
You.

05:49.726 --> 05:50.977
Mace your balls.

06:04.115 --> 06:05.283
You two hold hands.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.662
And you,

06:10.621 --> 06:12.290
recite <i>The Yellow Rose of Texas.</i>

06:12.790 --> 06:15.001
<i>There's a yellow rose of Texas</i>

06:15.293 --> 06:17.128
<i>I'm going down to see</i>

06:17.295 --> 06:19.213
<i>No other soldier knows her</i>

06:19.297 --> 06:21.299
<i>No soldier, only me</i>

06:21.424 --> 06:23.217
<i>She cried so when I left her</i>

06:23.468 --> 06:25.636
<i>It like to broke her heart</i>

06:25.762 --> 06:29.223
<i>And if I ever meet her
We never more will part</i>

06:29.307 --> 06:30.641
No, I don't like that.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.143
Like what?

06:32.393 --> 06:34.729
That thing of yours.
That thing that made me kiss you.

06:34.896 --> 06:35.897
Genesis.

06:35.980 --> 06:36.981
Whatever. I don't like it.

06:37.148 --> 06:38.775
You rather we just shoot our way out of this?

06:39.567 --> 06:40.735
Be fair at least.

06:41.319 --> 06:42.320
That thing ain't even fun.

06:42.487 --> 06:43.488
It's kind of fun.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.240
Something that gets in your head

06:46.324 --> 06:47.992
like some kind of smoky brain hand,

06:48.451 --> 06:50.495
and makes you do things? Uh-uh.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.371
- "Smoky brain hand?"
- Whatever.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.582
Look, my point is, how would you like it?

06:55.917 --> 06:57.293
Get Cassidy and let's go.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.231
Everybody, down!

07:23.319 --> 07:25.279
Sniper! We're in the open.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.489
Smoke!

07:51.264 --> 07:52.265
Cease fire!

07:54.433 --> 07:55.601
Help!

08:08.781 --> 08:10.324
<i>You talk about your Clementine</i>

08:10.408 --> 08:11.868
Stay down!

08:18.499 --> 08:19.667
God damn it!

08:34.974 --> 08:36.434
- What kind of gun is that?
- I don't know.

08:36.726 --> 08:37.935
Maybe I'll make him tell me.

08:48.446 --> 08:49.488
Time to go.

08:49.614 --> 08:50.740
I'm not leaving my car.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.118
Where's Cassidy?

08:54.577 --> 08:56.037
I'm not leaving my car, Jesse!

08:56.162 --> 08:57.455
Then you better siphon some gas.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.832
Siphon? With what?

09:03.586 --> 09:04.879
How about that?

09:05.129 --> 09:06.797
- No way.
- It's up to you.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.841
I gotta find Cassidy.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.166
- Ready to go?
- Yes, please.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.212
Go! Go, go, go!

10:32.383 --> 10:33.718
I gotta get the taste out.

10:53.571 --> 10:54.697
My Lord.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.199
What the heck you folks get into out there?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.535
Is that...

11:00.161 --> 11:01.203
Is that intestine?

11:02.038 --> 11:03.873
All right, I'm gonna call the cops right now!

11:04.040 --> 11:05.249
There's no cops left!

11:05.583 --> 11:06.959
That son of a bitch shot them all.

11:08.794 --> 11:09.962
We don't want any more trouble.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.630
So why don't you just
pretend we weren't here.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.435
Mmm-mmm.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.772
Here.

11:38.616 --> 11:39.909
Trust me.

12:14.485 --> 12:15.569
Hello.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.405
Come here, you little beauty.

12:43.848 --> 12:45.266
<i>Still no reports of survivors</i>

12:45.349 --> 12:47.476
<i>in the blast that destroyed
a small Texas town.</i>

12:47.810 --> 12:49.353
<i>Authorities are calling the explosion...</i>

12:49.728 --> 12:50.729
Hi.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.651
All right.

12:56.944 --> 13:01.282
I got bottled water...
Juice, some, uh...

13:02.741 --> 13:06.454
Yoo-hoo and hot sauce.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.541
Hello?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.210
All right. I'm ready. Let's go.

13:13.878 --> 13:15.212
Fine.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.215
Did you see that back there?

13:18.382 --> 13:19.633
It was like we weren't even there.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.051
- Everyone okay?
- Sure.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.929
What the hell happened up there?
Was that us or the cops?

13:24.096 --> 13:26.599
We didn't do anything.
Why would anybody wanna shoot at us?

13:26.807 --> 13:27.850
Have you not been
paying attention?

13:27.933 --> 13:30.060
Your boyfriend's got a bloody superpower.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.313
There's all kinds of folks
gonna be coming out after that.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.772
"Superpower." Please.

13:33.898 --> 13:36.275
No offense to our superhero
and his superpower,

13:36.692 --> 13:39.570
but maybe we just showed
up at the wrong place at the wrong time.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.030
We're in Texas.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.158
They pretty much
grow dumbass crazy here.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.368
I don't know. Padre, what do you think?

13:47.244 --> 13:48.412
We have a job to do.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.793
If I see him again, I'll deal with him.

13:56.754 --> 13:57.963
But for now we keep going.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.259
Unlucky start is all.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.427
That's what it is.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.763
That's what it is. It's an unlucky start.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.182
Nothing but smooth-ish sailing
from here on out, Padre.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.517
- Hey, Cass?
- What?

14:10.226 --> 14:12.603
You got some cat fur.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.605
Oh. Thanks.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.007
Ginger?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.135
Where'd you get to, girl?

15:02.778 --> 15:03.988
Preacher?

15:06.282 --> 15:08.659
He wasn't here.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.835
Preacher?

15:20.379 --> 15:22.965
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:23.591 --> 15:24.842
He wasn't here.

15:27.303 --> 15:28.429
Open.

15:30.306 --> 15:31.432
Sorry?

15:32.391 --> 15:33.559
Your mouth.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.686
Oh, God.

15:40.441 --> 15:41.442
No.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.492
You guys wait here.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.452
Mike can be...

16:35.913 --> 16:37.247
I'll be right back.

16:41.502 --> 16:45.464
Oh, yeah. Getting a real
religious scholar vibe here.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.257
Maybe he's between schools.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.176
Whatever.

16:50.094 --> 16:51.595
I just wanna take a shower.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.598
Keep finding bits of...

16:55.516 --> 16:57.059
I don't know what in my hair.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.366
What?

17:13.742 --> 17:14.952
Nothing.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.916
Tulip, I feel bad.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.043
- About what?
- About Jesse.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.462
I don't like keeping secrets from me mate.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.797
I didn't know.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.050
I didn't know you and him were a...

17:30.134 --> 17:32.636
When me and you, you know, when we...

17:32.761 --> 17:34.471
Look, I just... I say we tell him.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.140
I really... I think he will understand.

17:36.473 --> 17:40.060
Okay. I'mma try not to
exaggerate here, Cassidy.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.772
But out of all the stupid things
you've ever said,

17:44.398 --> 17:45.399
that is the stupidest.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.734
I doubt that's true.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.235
Listen to me, Cassidy.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.154
You wanna feel really bad?

17:50.279 --> 17:52.239
Go tell him we had sex.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.907
See what your mate does then.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.909
'Cause you don't know him like I do.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.829
I know he saved my life
more than once, all right?

17:58.912 --> 18:01.457
And I know he tries to do the right thing.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.125
More than most people do.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.711
Sure, Jesse's got sides to him.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.757
A good side, a fun side,
the boring Bible side,

18:11.049 --> 18:12.634
but he's got a whole other side.

18:13.469 --> 18:14.678
A deep-down side.

18:14.803 --> 18:15.971
Sure, we all got sides.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.057
Me, I got tons of them.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.436
Might be the most
many-sided person you ever met.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.604
Would you hush?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.274
What is that?

18:31.570 --> 18:32.738
Hello?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.422
- Hello?
- Hello?

18:50.506 --> 18:52.299
Yes! Hello! I'm here.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.478
Thank God. Quick. Phone. Give me a phone.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.814
Before he comes back.
Hurry, my phone. There's no time.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.065
Give me a phone before he comes...

19:08.232 --> 19:09.399
Leave her.

19:12.236 --> 19:13.904
Excuse me? Who is this?

19:14.238 --> 19:15.239
That's Ashleigh.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.241
Please.
I'm begging. Please. Please!

19:17.366 --> 19:18.575
Come on.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.577
You don't hear her as much inside.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.957
None of our business.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.919
Pleasure meeting you, Ashleigh.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.798
I'm sorry.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.261
No, please,
just let me use your phone, please!

19:38.846 --> 19:41.890
So, bathroom's in there, if you need.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.727
My wife used to tidy, but she died.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.896
Please! I can't
take much more of this!

19:47.980 --> 19:49.648
Young lady, that's enough.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.568
I have house guests.
Do I need to call your parents?

19:53.485 --> 19:55.279
No, Mike. Sorry.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.573
All right. Living room.

19:57.656 --> 20:01.660
That's Eddie the dog.
He used to bite, but then he got old.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.662
Can I ask a question that isn't about the dog

20:03.745 --> 20:05.080
and the different rooms?

20:06.290 --> 20:07.666
She wants to know about the girl.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.502
Well, parishioners need help
with their urges...

20:11.128 --> 20:12.880
Drugs, sex, Twitter...

20:12.963 --> 20:13.964
They come to me.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.634
So someone comes
to you for help and you put them in a cage?

20:17.968 --> 20:19.636
A covered cage. That's right.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.638
To curb their urges.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.894
Am I the only one who thinks
that's, like, psychotic?

20:26.977 --> 20:30.063
No. I was wondering the exact same thing.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.648
Why not just lock her in a cellar?

20:31.773 --> 20:34.109
You could chain her
to the bloody wall or something like that.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.570
Covered cage works best is why.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.197
Now, anyone else I never met before

20:39.364 --> 20:41.491
want to tell me how to minister?

20:44.995 --> 20:46.538
So...

20:46.705 --> 20:50.167
I know you didn't
come all this way to show off my manners.

20:51.877 --> 20:52.920
No.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.338
What then?

20:56.298 --> 20:58.050
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.302
Obviously.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.804
Okay. Spit it out.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.350
It's about God.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.856
Come on. There's whiskey.

21:15.943 --> 21:17.110
He's gone.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.821
You sure?

21:21.156 --> 21:22.866
Somehow I'm not surprised.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.910
These past few weeks,

21:26.203 --> 21:27.496
every time I prayed...

21:27.704 --> 21:29.039
He didn't answer.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.707
And now I know why.

21:31.875 --> 21:32.876
God's gone.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.044
Missing is what they said.

21:34.378 --> 21:35.462
Most likely walking the Earth.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.672
This angel said?

21:37.047 --> 21:38.548
That you commanded with your power?

21:38.632 --> 21:39.800
Genesis, that's right.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.677
Meaning what? Missing where?

21:42.219 --> 21:43.470
Well, you're the scholar.

21:44.513 --> 21:45.681
We're asking you.

21:47.891 --> 21:52.229
You know, when I was a young
man studying in Mesopotamia,

21:53.146 --> 21:56.400
I came across a map that claimed to foretell

21:56.525 --> 21:59.820
the Almighty's whereabouts
if He ever walked the Earth.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.155
Mesopotamia? Where's that?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.324
I don't know,
but it sounds like just the thing, doesn't it?

22:04.408 --> 22:06.618
Are you kids high right now?

22:07.411 --> 22:08.412
No.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.872
Not in a covered
cage kind of a way, we're not.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.583
Idiots. There's no map.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.420
But something you've read?
Something in your library?

22:16.712 --> 22:17.713
No.

22:17.796 --> 22:18.797
Nothing in all these books?

22:19.047 --> 22:20.048
Books?

22:20.132 --> 22:21.925
You call Heaven on an angel phone

22:22.050 --> 22:24.052
to discover God's gone to roam the Earth?

22:24.136 --> 22:25.470
What book is that exactly?

22:25.595 --> 22:26.930
All right. All right.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.434
So, something you've seen or heard?

22:32.602 --> 22:33.770
Someone you talked to?

22:34.438 --> 22:35.814
I said no.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.110
And I've said it about every
which way I can think of.

22:41.445 --> 22:44.072
Look, I'm sorry.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.366
I know you had your hopes up.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.660
But that's why there's whiskey.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.164
Can I just have
my phone for five minutes, please?

22:52.289 --> 22:53.957
Just to post something on Instagram.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.460
Just say your prayers like I told you.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.921
No one wants to see photos
of a sick girl in a dark cage.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.798
I think you'd be surprised, actually, mate.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.008
Hush your mouth.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.634
Can you refill
my water dish then?

23:04.885 --> 23:06.386
Give me a sec.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.517
He seems really nice.

23:13.018 --> 23:16.021
Yep. A nice waste of time.

23:16.521 --> 23:17.731
Maybe.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.484
What you got there?

23:20.650 --> 23:21.693
Your parents.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.696
- Mike married them.
- Let's have a look.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.701
John Custer and Christina...

23:30.660 --> 23:31.828
L'Angelle.

23:32.621 --> 23:33.997
She was beautiful.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.292
Is she...

23:37.584 --> 23:38.710
A long time ago.

23:39.753 --> 23:40.879
There's just the three of them.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.130
Where's the rest of the family?

23:43.131 --> 23:45.383
Mike was pretty much
the only family my father had.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.969
On your mom's side, the...

23:48.136 --> 23:49.179
L'Angelle.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.347
L'Angelles, where were they?

23:56.478 --> 23:57.521
They weren't invited.

24:02.526 --> 24:05.195
That Internet is a soul killer.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.030
Stay clear of it if you can.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.199
You spending the night?

24:09.658 --> 24:10.992
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.661
Eddie and I'll take the couch.

24:13.537 --> 24:14.871
You can have my room.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.165
Wait, I'm sorry, um...

24:18.333 --> 24:20.544
Thanks for having us and all,

24:21.128 --> 24:23.713
but don't you have, like, a guest room?

24:28.802 --> 24:31.388
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.768
It's cozy. Isn't it?

24:38.895 --> 24:40.105
Now, look.

24:40.397 --> 24:43.692
I know this is your first
night together in quite a while,

24:43.775 --> 24:46.570
so I'd imagine you have plans
of a romantic nature.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.738
- It's fine.
- No, Jess. I just...

24:49.948 --> 24:51.700
- I hate to be a third wheel.
- No, you're not.

24:51.783 --> 24:55.579
No. Listen, in Ireland, when you're poor,

24:56.413 --> 24:57.706
you got your folks, they're shagging away

24:57.789 --> 24:59.875
right on top of you like lunatics, practically.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.544
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

25:03.253 --> 25:06.590
The grunting, rocking back
and forth. The smells.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.967
You learn to sleep through it.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.469
- Right.
- I'm not gonna be an issue.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.096
It's not a problem for me.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.764
- Thanks, Cass.
- All right.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.642
I think we're all tired anyway.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.270
Right?

25:20.937 --> 25:22.022
Yep.

25:23.773 --> 25:24.941
Right.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.197
Rumor is I'm a bit of a snorer,

25:30.280 --> 25:32.782
so if it gets vexatious, just give me a nudge.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.149
You expecting someone?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.070
Just the stars.

26:12.906 --> 26:15.575
You ever consider
that if the good Lord's gone missing,

26:16.785 --> 26:18.328
maybe He's got a reason?

26:20.288 --> 26:21.456
Yeah, and I wanna hear it.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.167
Maybe He has a good reason.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.711
Maybe He's in trouble.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.838
Maybe something went wrong.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.090
Maybe He needs help.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.383
Maybe we can help Him.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.262
What if I don't like His reason?

26:36.972 --> 26:39.516
If I find out He's left
us here all alone to pick up His mess?

26:41.226 --> 26:43.353
I'm gonna hold that son
of a bitch to account.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.688
Don't you blaspheme.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.815
Your daddy heard you talking like that?

26:47.107 --> 26:51.027
"Hold Him to account."
That right? You and what army?

26:51.194 --> 26:53.822
I don't need an army. I have Genesis.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.035
Show me. Go on.

26:59.703 --> 27:03.039
Otherwise, for all I know,
you've just lost your mind.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.544
Break something.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.217
Jesus.

27:14.509 --> 27:16.136
Before my daddy died,

27:16.553 --> 27:18.555
if you wanna talk about my daddy...

27:21.141 --> 27:23.059
Right before he died, he said

27:25.228 --> 27:26.730
big things would be coming for me.

27:28.356 --> 27:31.860
Said it like it was a promise
of some future calling.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.574
For the longest time,
I didn't know what he meant by that.

27:41.286 --> 27:45.373
For a while, I thought maybe
he meant Annville, the church.

27:48.585 --> 27:49.961
This is it.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.922
This is my call.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.052
I'm gonna find Him, Mike.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.138
Whether you help me or not.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.940
What you got there?

28:12.359 --> 28:14.527
I ran into a woman, few weeks back.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.488
Parishioner of mine.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.657
I had her out in the garage a couple of times.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.451
Booze, pills.

28:22.577 --> 28:25.997
But she'd been sober a while,
or so I thought.

28:28.124 --> 28:31.669
I found her looking pale
as a ghost, trembling.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.297
I ask her, "What's wrong?"

28:34.964 --> 28:39.969
And she told me God Himself
had just been in.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.973
So I assumed she was back on the bottle.

28:44.641 --> 28:45.975
But now?

28:47.018 --> 28:48.311
Looking back on it?

28:52.023 --> 28:54.025
She was pale as a ghost.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.531
That's her card?

29:00.824 --> 29:05.995
It's sort of a dance hall
down in Kimble County.

29:08.373 --> 29:09.541
Right.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.543
Maybe she can help.

29:11.835 --> 29:14.254
So I guess we just drive
down to Kimble County

29:15.839 --> 29:18.758
and ask to talk to this "Tammy."

29:21.511 --> 29:22.846
Can't be that easy.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.558
No, son. I'm sure it won't be.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.229
You broke my door and my dog.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.898
What the hell else do you want?

30:57.440 --> 30:58.733
Preacher.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.610
I'm the only preacher here.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.530
There's whiskey.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.699
- Sit.
- Where is he?

31:10.411 --> 31:12.705
He cut out for Dodge City first light.

31:13.248 --> 31:14.749
Join up with Wyatt Earp.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.418
Where is he?

31:17.919 --> 31:20.004
Georgia. Midnight train.

31:21.506 --> 31:22.966
Where is he?

31:24.217 --> 31:28.513
He's on his way to San Antone,
to cornhole your mother, the whore.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.144
You know who I am?

31:36.521 --> 31:37.647
You're the...

31:42.819 --> 31:44.821
Yeah. I've heard about you.

31:45.154 --> 31:49.200
So, you know I can make you tell me.

31:50.159 --> 31:54.038
And you know that knife
that you're holding in your hand

31:54.414 --> 31:55.832
won't stop me asking.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.001
No.

31:58.543 --> 32:00.503
But it'll stop me from saying.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.202
God came here?

32:33.703 --> 32:34.787
That's what Mike said.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.372
I think this is just a cover.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.541
Hide in plain sight kind of thing.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.418
Outside, it's a strip club,

32:40.627 --> 32:44.339
inside, old chaps wearing
robes, smoking bloody pipes and that.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.305
Or, even better,
it's just a normal strip club.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.766
All right.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.518
I'm gonna go and have a look
'round. See what I can find out.

33:05.526 --> 33:06.944
I'm gonna look for Tammy.

33:07.278 --> 33:08.279
Mmm-hmm.

33:16.496 --> 33:17.580
Hey.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.374
What's going on?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.751
You haven't heard? Whole town blew up.

33:22.418 --> 33:23.670
What town?

33:23.795 --> 33:25.046
Come on. She's in back.

33:28.508 --> 33:29.592
Yeah?

33:30.677 --> 33:31.886
They're asking for you.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.765
Not again.

33:35.932 --> 33:38.351
Tell the Bishop no more church events.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.936
Not after what happened last time.

33:41.354 --> 33:43.189
- What happened last time?
- I don't know what that means.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.273
You're not from the diocese?

33:44.857 --> 33:45.858
No.

33:49.696 --> 33:52.073
Doug, I got hands in Room Three.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.616
We're looking for God.

33:56.953 --> 33:58.121
Aren't we all?

33:58.287 --> 33:59.789
Mike told us you might have seen Him.

34:00.957 --> 34:02.291
I know a lot of Mikes.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.919
A lot of Mikes that put you
in a covered cage?

34:05.628 --> 34:06.629
Oh.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.882
That Mike. Yeah, that Mike thinks I'm crazy.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.300
Not after we talked to him.

34:11.551 --> 34:13.386
He thinks that maybe you saw God.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.305
"Saw God."

34:17.223 --> 34:18.307
Yeah.

34:18.433 --> 34:19.809
Now I think he's crazy.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.937
Tammy, your hand's shaking.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.315
I think maybe you saw God, too.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.116
Well, on account of Mike
and that cage that saved my life,

34:35.199 --> 34:37.744
I'll tell you this much.
But that's it, you understand?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.329
Close the door.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.172
God was here.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.303
He came in a couple times a few months ago.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.347
He sat in the back, kept to himself.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.810
Asked the band to play <i>Walk to the Peak.</i>

35:03.644 --> 35:04.937
Guess it was His favorite.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.567
Other than that? He was a customer.

35:10.193 --> 35:11.235
A customer?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.864
- Really?
- No, I lied. He was a dancer.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.034
What was He like?

35:18.534 --> 35:19.952
What did God look like?

35:20.286 --> 35:21.329
What was He doing here?

35:21.412 --> 35:23.247
Let me ask you a question, Preacher.

35:23.581 --> 35:24.582
What do you want from Him?

35:25.124 --> 35:26.459
We just have a few questions.

35:26.918 --> 35:29.045
"Questions?" The arrogance.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.005
God won't answer them.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.216
- He might.
- No, He won't.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.094
He'll turn His head
and stare through you like glass.

35:38.221 --> 35:40.890
You'll feel so naked
and terrified, you'll shit yourself.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.101
But He won't answer your questions.

35:48.147 --> 35:52.026
Customer confidentiality
is a priority here at She-She.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.404
So, help yourself
to a fistful of peanuts on the way out, huh?

35:56.531 --> 35:57.907
So, Genesis.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.076
I can use it on her, right?

36:00.243 --> 36:01.327
Hm, I don't know.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.788
What's not to know? This is textbook.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.958
She is being a dick and her hair is stupid,

36:07.041 --> 36:09.794
but I think Genesis should be
a last-resort kind of thing.

36:10.795 --> 36:13.297
Doug? Hello? Do you copy?

36:13.673 --> 36:15.174
Come into my office, please.

36:15.591 --> 36:18.219
We're asking questions,
she's not answering them.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.679
Now she's calling Doug.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.764
Seems pretty last-resort if you ask me.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.433
No, you're being lazy.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.270
If you want answers,
just beat them out of her.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.730
I'm not gonna beat her. She's an old lady.

36:30.106 --> 36:32.942
She ain't that old. I'll do it if you want.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.944
Doug. I need you in my office.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.863
At least let me ask what God was doing here.

36:36.946 --> 36:39.198
Why do all men come
to these dumb-ass places?

36:39.907 --> 36:41.284
First time it's for the girls.

36:41.617 --> 36:45.705
And if they come back,
it's for one girl in particular.

36:51.878 --> 36:54.297
He fell in love? With who?

36:54.630 --> 36:57.216
I told you what I was gonna
tell you, now get the hell out of here.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.135
I'm guessing it's the trashy blonde.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.304
Doug. Damn it.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.805
Doug, you idiot.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.974
Quit your fooling around and get in here.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.143
I really want to use it on her.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.354
What are your specific objections?

37:10.479 --> 37:14.150
My specific objections
are that it's mind invasion.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.568
I am not down with that.

37:15.818 --> 37:18.821
What if I use it on her
and erase her mind after?

37:19.030 --> 37:21.198
That way she'll forget the invasion feeling.

37:21.866 --> 37:23.326
Doug!

37:23.451 --> 37:24.827
She is really irritating. Fine.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.498
So, Tammy.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.125
I'm gonna do something to you.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.501
You ain't doing shit!

37:32.585 --> 37:34.503
- Hey. Calm down.
- Anybody tries to hurt me...

37:34.629 --> 37:36.464
I will stab their eyes out.

37:36.672 --> 37:37.882
Tammy, please.

37:38.007 --> 37:39.258
Doug! Doug! Help me!

37:39.550 --> 37:40.551
Get in here!

37:40.760 --> 37:44.680
Tammy. Tammy, it's fine.
It's fine. No one's gonna hurt you.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.270
No.

37:52.730 --> 37:53.898
Damn.

37:55.066 --> 37:58.319
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Damn it.

37:58.736 --> 38:00.988
I'm sorry, Tammy,
but you're gonna need to tell me.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.157
Who was God coming to see here?

38:03.449 --> 38:04.784
Who was God's girl?

38:05.534 --> 38:10.456
God didn't come for the girls, you idiot.

38:11.082 --> 38:13.459
He came for the jazz.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.419
The jazz?

38:15.920 --> 38:17.546
I hope you find him, Preacher.

38:18.381 --> 38:22.510
You will shit yourself.

38:28.808 --> 38:29.809
Woah.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.228
You're in trouble now.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.278
Look, now, for me,
I really like the disruption of the Taurus.

39:22.445 --> 39:24.780
- No. You wanna stop something quick?
- Okay, yeah.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.532
- It's the Springfield, okay?
- The Springfield?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.784
- You're good to go.
- Come on.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.120
Move.

39:35.958 --> 39:37.752
- Sorry.
- What the hell were you thinking?

39:37.960 --> 39:40.629
You can touch the girls
for three seconds and everybody knows it.

39:40.713 --> 39:43.215
It's industry standard.
There's a three-second rule.

39:43.466 --> 39:46.469
That's for food, Cassidy. You got a lady shot.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.305
No, I didn't shoot anybody.
That was Douglas, not me.

39:49.472 --> 39:50.639
Enough!

39:51.557 --> 39:52.892
We've been over it.

39:53.851 --> 39:54.977
Let's go to bed.

40:01.025 --> 40:05.237
Hey. Did we get anything out of her?
Any leads before she was...

40:07.198 --> 40:08.783
We learned we're on God's trail.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.786
Great! That's good, isn't it?

40:12.787 --> 40:15.790
Right there on His trail.
That's progress, though, right?

40:16.165 --> 40:17.166
Right?

40:17.458 --> 40:18.501
Good night, Cassidy.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.627
Padre.

40:21.921 --> 40:23.464
Padre, I'm sorry.

40:25.841 --> 40:28.010
I won't
let you down again, all right?

40:30.805 --> 40:32.723
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.031
<i>Mumbai Sky Tower,</i>

40:49.115 --> 40:52.993
<i>East Texas's premiere and only
actual Indian casino and resort,</i>

40:53.077 --> 40:55.454
<i>is proud to announce our brand-new act.</i>

40:55.996 --> 40:58.958
<i>You think you've seen it all,

40:59.166 --> 41:00.292
Hey.

41:00.376 --> 41:02.253
<i>A once-in-a-lifetime experience...</i>

41:02.336 --> 41:03.546
You know what I like to do?

41:04.505 --> 41:06.006
When I've had a bad day,

41:07.466 --> 41:09.468
it feels like I got nothing but problems?

41:10.761 --> 41:12.555
I like to go in the bathroom

41:15.349 --> 41:17.393
and lock the door behind me.

41:28.154 --> 41:29.155
Open it.

41:29.488 --> 41:30.739
You open it.

42:33.469 --> 42:34.887
<i>You think you've seen it all,</i>

42:34.970 --> 42:37.723
<i>until you've seen The Amazing Ganesh.</i>

42:37.806 --> 42:41.435
<i>A once-in-a-lifetime

<i>for a performance to remember from</i>

42:44.980 --> 42:46.815
<i>a performer you will never forget.</i>

42:46.941 --> 42:47.942
Huh?

43:28.941 --> 43:29.942
Stop!

43:39.785 --> 43:41.120
I said stop!
