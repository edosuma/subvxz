WEBVTT

01:49.085 --> 01:50.152
Mmm.

03:00.489 --> 03:02.925
Read all about it!

03:02.958 --> 03:06.229
Killer strikes again!

03:06.262 --> 03:09.664
Read all about it!

03:09.697 --> 03:12.101
Killer strikes...

03:15.870 --> 03:17.039
We've got another one.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.109
Amelia, good.
You're here.

03:22.111 --> 03:24.780
The body was found
early this morning.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.282
If I had to guess,

03:26.315 --> 03:30.520
she was probably killed
only a few hours before that.

03:30.553 --> 03:33.322
As of the moment, no witnesses.

03:33.355 --> 03:34.823
Of course.

03:42.131 --> 03:43.132
Red hair.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.335
The guy definitely has a type.

03:49.838 --> 03:54.110
The wound matches exactly
what we've seen before.

03:54.143 --> 03:56.578
I see we've got some
blood splatter here,

03:56.611 --> 03:58.848
the angle of which suggests

03:58.881 --> 04:00.883
he was on top of
her when it happened.

04:03.486 --> 04:04.652
She saw it coming.

04:07.089 --> 04:09.358
Not sure if that makes
it better or worse.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.031
It's fairly small amount of
blood for how much she's lost.

04:15.064 --> 04:16.365
We won't know that for sure

04:16.398 --> 04:18.367
until Seward gets a look
at her back at his lab.

04:20.402 --> 04:23.339
I think it's time that
we face the facts

04:23.372 --> 04:26.309
that we might
be dealing with a...

04:26.342 --> 04:29.579
Spit it out, Van Helsing.
Trepidation doesn't suit you.

04:29.612 --> 04:31.280
Mass murderer.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.648
This is one of those occasions
where I hate to say it.

04:33.681 --> 04:35.817
I agree.

04:35.850 --> 04:38.254
And we're not alone.

04:40.055 --> 04:41.623
Are they still on about this?

04:41.656 --> 04:43.092
Unfortunately, yes.

04:43.125 --> 04:46.128
They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.198
It's lazy sensationalism.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.634
Like you said, sells papers.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.303
You gotta admit.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.706
A century-old mass murder case
that ended at a creepy castle,

04:57.739 --> 04:59.708
the kind of stuff
that whets the appetite.

04:59.741 --> 05:03.946
Yeah, if you believe in myth and
ghost stories and not in facts.

05:03.979 --> 05:06.849
Besides, see,
they didn't mention

05:06.882 --> 05:08.284
that we did our due diligence,

05:08.317 --> 05:10.586
did a sweep of the castle
and found nothing.

05:10.619 --> 05:13.589
Why let facts get in the way?

05:13.622 --> 05:16.993
I can't have the press
interfering with my case.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.461
What are we gonna do?

05:18.494 --> 05:21.130
We aren't.
I will.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.598
What you need to do
is get to work

05:22.631 --> 05:25.334
and solve this before it
gets even more out of hand.

05:33.676 --> 05:35.444
What could even do this?

05:42.451 --> 05:43.986
Well?

05:44.019 --> 05:47.857
Well, every time
I find something

05:47.890 --> 05:49.392
that I think is conclusive,

05:49.425 --> 05:51.760
I find something
that contradicts it

05:51.793 --> 05:53.329
and makes me doubt myself.

05:53.362 --> 05:55.665
Renfield seems to think that
the relatively recent nature

05:55.698 --> 05:58.901
of this one's passing might
help us answer questions.

05:58.934 --> 06:00.570
Oh, Renfield, the good captain,

06:00.603 --> 06:03.406
doesn't seem to understand that
to be able to accomplish that,

06:03.439 --> 06:05.374
you have to have
somewhere to start.

06:05.407 --> 06:09.411
And this... this just
doesn't make any sense!

06:11.547 --> 06:12.481
What do you mean?

06:14.483 --> 06:16.319
Well...

06:16.352 --> 06:19.188
all the bodies died from
a massive amount of blood loss,

06:19.221 --> 06:21.823
right, brought about
from a neck trauma?

06:21.856 --> 06:24.493
And though these slashes
are serious,

06:24.526 --> 06:27.163
they're just not congruent
with your

06:27.196 --> 06:29.831
regular jugular slash
or throat cut.

06:29.864 --> 06:32.435
You know what I mean.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.904
There's gotta be
something we're missing.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.239
Impossible problems...

06:36.272 --> 06:39.575
Have probable solutions.
Yes, I know, I know.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.777
Maybe we just have to look
at the facts we have.

06:42.810 --> 06:47.416
We know that the lacerations
and trauma caused by the wounds

06:47.449 --> 06:50.586
severed the jugular,
leading to death.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.855
And it was done with
relative efficiency.

06:52.888 --> 06:54.490
Yes, yes, yes, but the
tearing of the epidermis

06:54.523 --> 06:57.226
around the punctures
is not done by any bladed weapon

06:57.259 --> 06:58.694
that I know of.

06:58.727 --> 07:00.095
It's almost like it's...

07:01.697 --> 07:03.232
like a bite.

07:04.099 --> 07:05.800
Could it be a bite?

07:05.833 --> 07:07.637
They just don't match,
the spacing

07:07.670 --> 07:11.907
and our canines are just not up
to that level of efficiency.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.510
And then there's
the blood, right?

07:14.543 --> 07:17.947
This body is a dried husk.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.083
If all the blood is gone,
where does it go?

07:21.116 --> 07:23.486
Well, that's' the question,
isn't it? That's the kicker.

07:23.519 --> 07:25.787
Of the blood that's left,
do we have a sample?

07:25.820 --> 07:29.392
Uh, yes, yes.

07:29.425 --> 07:32.995
I ran some tests to see
if the killer used any kind of

07:33.028 --> 07:34.697
a sedative or
an outside chemical

07:34.730 --> 07:36.831
to sort of subdue the victims.

07:36.864 --> 07:39.902
But... I ran it a
couple of times,

07:39.935 --> 07:41.504
I couldn't find anything.

07:41.537 --> 07:42.538
Can I have that?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.275
I don't usually let
evidence out of the lab.

07:49.144 --> 07:50.579
Where are you going?

07:50.612 --> 07:52.982
I want to see if Harker
can turn anything up.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.350
Oh, I knew it.

07:54.383 --> 07:56.686
He's a brilliant
chemist, Jack.

07:56.719 --> 07:59.388
And we look at details
as they pertain to the case.

07:59.421 --> 08:01.991
He looks at them
in a scientific puzzle.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.426
Yes, yes.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.261
And he's able to turn
things up we often miss.

08:05.294 --> 08:08.130
Yes, yes, he's been very
helpful in the past, I agree.

08:10.466 --> 08:11.500
You bring my blood back.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.535
I'll see what I can do.

08:12.568 --> 08:14.470
Let you know if
we turn anything up.

08:14.503 --> 08:16.372
And you owe me a dinner
for all this!

08:16.405 --> 08:18.007
I'll tell Mina
you're coming over.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.308
Maybe she'll make
you that roast again.

08:19.341 --> 08:20.476
Ooh, roast.

08:40.462 --> 08:43.232
I didn't expect you so soon.

08:43.265 --> 08:45.434
Do you have what I require?

08:47.536 --> 08:48.470
Yes...

08:54.009 --> 08:55.411
Master.

09:32.648 --> 09:34.885
So you're telling me
there was no blood

09:34.918 --> 09:36.552
anywhere else in the room?

09:36.585 --> 09:38.421
Seems impossible, right?

09:38.454 --> 09:40.289
That vial is what
Seward managed

09:40.322 --> 09:41.457
to extract from the body,

09:43.826 --> 09:44.827
And this was it?

09:44.860 --> 09:46.228
More or less.

09:48.664 --> 09:50.132
How curious.

09:50.165 --> 09:51.433
Sort of why I'm here.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.536
You know I always appreciate

09:53.569 --> 09:55.304
when you bring me
a puzzle to solve.

09:55.337 --> 09:57.640
Unfortunately, it's not
like when we were kids.

09:57.673 --> 09:59.442
I suppose.

09:59.475 --> 10:01.477
Bigger challenges,
bigger stakes.

10:01.510 --> 10:03.045
That's one way to put it.

10:04.046 --> 10:05.447
You think you can analyze it?

10:07.015 --> 10:08.784
I believe I can.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.020
In fact, I have several
texts around here somewhere

10:11.053 --> 10:12.923
which might actually
provide some clues...

10:12.956 --> 10:15.825
I came to you as
a chemist, Jonathan,

10:15.858 --> 10:17.393
not because of your hobbies.

10:17.426 --> 10:20.129
The study of occultism
is no mere hobby.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.831
It provides insight into
things we have yet

10:21.864 --> 10:23.299
to even begin to comprehend.

10:23.332 --> 10:26.168
I appreciate the interest,
but the study of magic

10:26.201 --> 10:28.872
and ghosts is
no comparison to facts.

10:28.905 --> 10:33.175
And, quite frankly,
that's what I need right now.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.744
There are those that
believe that magic

10:35.777 --> 10:38.981
is merely science
we don't understand yet.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.217
There is a very
real mass murderer

10:41.250 --> 10:43.619
stalking the streets
right now.

10:43.652 --> 10:45.421
I came to you
because you're able

10:45.454 --> 10:49.692
to put scientific bits
of the puzzle together.

10:49.725 --> 10:51.327
I admit that
there are some cases

10:51.360 --> 10:53.595
we couldn't have
cracked without you.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.901
That's the Jonathan
I need right now.

10:57.934 --> 10:59.936
If there's something in that
blood that shouldn't be there,

10:59.969 --> 11:01.303
I'll find it.

11:01.336 --> 11:03.205
I just need some time.

11:03.238 --> 11:05.107
Thank you.

11:06.141 --> 11:08.010
Don't take too long, though.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.779
Seward was already on edge that
I had to borrow his evidence.

11:10.812 --> 11:12.214
Oh, Jack.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.482
What did you have to
bribe him with this time?

11:13.515 --> 11:14.650
Dinner?

11:14.683 --> 11:16.318
How'd you know?

11:16.351 --> 11:18.020
His pride won't allow
him to admit this,

11:18.053 --> 11:22.424
but he lets me bring you things
'cause he knows you get results.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.626
Prove us both right, yeah?

11:25.827 --> 11:27.696
Tell you what.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.966
If I don't bring you
back something,

11:29.999 --> 11:31.767
I'll make dinner
for all of you.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.036
Things are bad enough
out there as it is.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.637
Let's not make it worse.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.254
Hey!

11:52.287 --> 11:54.156
Amelia? I didn't expect
you home so soon.

11:54.189 --> 11:56.325
Didn't mean to scare you.
It's just been a long day.

11:56.358 --> 11:57.994
I figured I'd grab
a bite to eat.

11:58.027 --> 11:59.461
How are you doing, beautiful?

11:59.494 --> 12:00.763
What's the occasion?

12:00.796 --> 12:02.264
I didn't miss
anything important, did I?

12:02.297 --> 12:03.532
No, you're off the hook.

12:03.565 --> 12:05.601
These actually aren't for us.

12:05.634 --> 12:06.802
We have company.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.270
We do?

12:08.303 --> 12:09.772
You know how I've been
hoping that the firm

12:09.805 --> 12:11.640
would eventually let me
handle an account on my own?

12:11.673 --> 12:14.476
But it just felt like they
were making me wait forever?

12:14.509 --> 12:17.379
Mina, tell me what
I think you're gonna say.

12:17.412 --> 12:19.015
Well, a new account
just came in...

12:19.048 --> 12:21.051
and this foreign dignitary
who's looking for some

12:21.084 --> 12:22.251
real estate here
in the city...

12:22.284 --> 12:24.353
and they assigned me
to help him.

12:24.386 --> 12:25.487
That's amazing!

12:25.520 --> 12:27.690
Thank you.
It's a big deal.

12:27.723 --> 12:29.558
If I can pull this off,
then I might just be able

12:29.591 --> 12:32.494
to prove that I can make it as
a successful solicitor yet.

12:32.527 --> 12:35.097
They're not gonna
know what's hit them.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.098
And the wine?

12:36.131 --> 12:37.833
Oh, that's the thing.

12:37.866 --> 12:40.736
The dignitary, the man
that I'm helping find a place,

12:40.769 --> 12:42.605
he's here.

12:42.638 --> 12:43.839
He is?

12:47.509 --> 12:49.445
- It's late.
- Yeah.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.714
And I just thought that maybe as
a get to know you gesture

12:51.747 --> 12:53.950
- that I should...
- Absolutely.

12:53.983 --> 12:55.851
You've celebrating to do!
Go, go, go!

13:38.460 --> 13:41.230
Miss Mina!
I didn't realize we had company.

13:41.263 --> 13:42.765
Yes.

13:42.798 --> 13:45.734
This is my girlfriend,
Amelia Van Helsing.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.670
She arrived here while
I was getting our drinks.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.439
Amelia, this is Count Dracula.

14:31.313 --> 14:34.050
You know,
I don't drink wine often.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.684
But this has been lovely.

14:35.717 --> 14:38.654
So glad you were able to
join us, Miss Van Helsing.

14:38.687 --> 14:41.991
Mina didn't tell me she
had such a charming partner.

14:42.024 --> 14:44.194
Amelia, please.

14:44.227 --> 14:46.795
And of the two of use,
Mina is the charming one.

14:46.828 --> 14:48.965
Far too many people
grumble at my presence

14:48.998 --> 14:50.499
to think otherwise.

14:50.532 --> 14:52.902
It's just nice to
have her home for a bit...

14:52.935 --> 14:54.303
what with everything.

14:54.336 --> 14:55.905
Ah, yes.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.873
I've read some of the
garish details in the papers.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.778
Don't take everything you read
in the local rag at face value.

15:03.913 --> 15:05.481
I rarely do.

15:05.514 --> 15:08.450
Thought I must confess,
when I read the name

15:08.483 --> 15:10.786
of the investigator
in charge of the matter,

15:10.819 --> 15:12.889
I never expected
to be dining with her

15:12.922 --> 15:15.225
later that evening.

15:15.258 --> 15:17.093
Strange coincidence, isn't it?

15:17.126 --> 15:18.995
The world is full of them.

15:20.762 --> 15:22.664
It's comforting
to know the police

15:22.697 --> 15:24.699
are working so diligently
on the matter.

15:28.938 --> 15:31.807
So, are you looking
to relocate permanently

15:31.840 --> 15:33.943
or just acquiring properties?

15:33.976 --> 15:37.345
It all depends on what
the lovely Miss Mina shows me.

15:39.581 --> 15:42.218
A little bit of both, I suspect.

15:42.251 --> 15:44.753
A number of years ago,
I spent a little time here.

15:44.786 --> 15:47.924
There was just something
about it that felt like home.

15:50.159 --> 15:51.560
I think that's lovely.

15:51.593 --> 15:55.297
Just a feeling
of certainty one gets.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.534
I've been traveling
abroad for a great while.

15:58.567 --> 16:02.771
Somehow I always knew
what I wanted was here.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.309
Well, then must
find him a good place.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.012
Dinner party
etiquette demands it.

16:09.045 --> 16:11.915
I have utmost faith
in Miss Mina's acumen.

16:11.948 --> 16:13.983
When I visited
the solicitor's office,

16:14.016 --> 16:17.820
I saw her and knew
she'd be the one to help me.

16:17.853 --> 16:22.825
I didn't realize that
my assignment was by request.

16:22.858 --> 16:27.129
I made the suggestion and the
partners at your firm obliged.

16:31.234 --> 16:34.703
I wanted someone who sees
the city a little differently.

16:41.743 --> 16:45.380
I had an instinct
and I followed it.

16:46.414 --> 16:47.917
And my instincts
are rarely wrong.

16:49.684 --> 16:52.222
I... don't know what to say.

16:52.255 --> 16:54.324
I'm truly honored.

16:54.357 --> 16:55.390
I won't let you down.

16:55.423 --> 16:56.960
I don't know about you,

16:56.993 --> 16:59.427
but this seems like the perfect
excuse for another toast.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.733
Who could that be at this hour?

17:11.340 --> 17:12.674
Jonathan, what's...

17:12.707 --> 17:13.910
It's too terrible
to consider, Amelia!

17:13.943 --> 17:15.111
But when
the evidence suggests...

17:15.144 --> 17:16.545
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.579
The improbable is probable,
we must, we must!

17:17.612 --> 17:18.680
Could you keep it down, please!

17:18.713 --> 17:19.949
Mina's having a work dinner.

17:19.982 --> 17:21.817
I don't need to
cause unnecessary alarm.

17:21.850 --> 17:22.886
Sorry.

17:22.919 --> 17:25.255
I just... I think
I found something.

17:25.288 --> 17:26.421
With the blood?

17:26.454 --> 17:27.891
Potentially.

17:27.924 --> 17:30.525
And if I'm right,
it's something awful.

17:30.558 --> 17:31.793
Let's talk outside.

17:36.731 --> 17:38.034
What's going on?

17:38.067 --> 17:40.502
There were trace amounts
of saliva in the blood.

17:40.535 --> 17:42.437
But the more
significant thing is

17:42.470 --> 17:43.705
what that can
potentially represent.

17:43.738 --> 17:45.074
I don't understand.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.976
The punctures,
the absence of blood,

17:47.009 --> 17:49.778
the calculated kill crossed
with the primal violence.

17:49.811 --> 17:52.748
It all felt too familiar
to be coincidence.

17:52.781 --> 17:56.386
So I started cross-referencing
some of my texts.

17:56.419 --> 17:59.521
And all signs
point to Nosferatu.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.792
I think we may
be dealing with a vampire.

18:03.825 --> 18:04.928
A what?

18:04.961 --> 18:06.129
The vampire is a
perceived mythological creature

18:06.162 --> 18:07.163
of undead origin...

18:07.196 --> 18:09.999
I know what
a vampire is, Jonathan.

18:10.032 --> 18:12.734
But if you recall,
I explicitly asked you

18:12.767 --> 18:15.204
to stick to science on
this one, no fairy stories.

18:15.237 --> 18:17.639
I know, but it could
explain so many of

18:17.672 --> 18:18.640
the unknown variables
of the case:

18:20.176 --> 18:22.912
The irregular wound,
the loss and absence of blood.

18:22.945 --> 18:24.613
You and your colleagues
missed certain details

18:24.646 --> 18:26.849
because they were things you
didn't even know to look for.

18:26.882 --> 18:28.450
Are you hearing yourself?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.852
There's a very
real serial killer

18:29.885 --> 18:31.354
stalking the streets
and murdering women.

18:31.387 --> 18:34.523
I need something that is
going to help me find him now!

18:34.556 --> 18:36.725
I appreciate your reticence,

18:36.758 --> 18:39.262
but I said it before
and I'll say it again.

18:39.295 --> 18:42.098
Sometimes the things
we consider fantastical

18:42.131 --> 18:44.067
are merely truths
we're not yet

18:44.100 --> 18:45.935
allowing ourselves
to understand.

18:45.968 --> 18:48.004
I'm sorry, Jonathan,
but I just...

18:51.440 --> 18:53.109
You just got a call.

18:53.142 --> 18:55.845
They need you.
There's been another...

18:55.878 --> 18:57.579
There's been another murder.

18:59.448 --> 19:02.151
Mina, please see Count Dracula
out and lock the door.

19:04.586 --> 19:06.255
I'm coming with you.

19:06.288 --> 19:07.890
Like hell you are.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.769
Ah, Amelia.
It's good you're here.

19:22.771 --> 19:25.208
Oh, surprise.
Look who you brought.

19:25.241 --> 19:27.443
- Jack.
- Jonathan.

19:27.476 --> 19:30.013
I thought you'd be out
chasing ghosts or something.

19:30.046 --> 19:33.615
Nope. I've been too busy
doing your job for you.

19:33.648 --> 19:36.785
Boys... play nice.

19:36.818 --> 19:39.788
I'm surprised to see
you out of the lab.

19:39.821 --> 19:43.359
Renfield had more
important things to do.

19:43.392 --> 19:46.661
And he suggested that
if I showed up at the scene

19:46.694 --> 19:49.065
I might be able
to glean something

19:49.098 --> 19:53.002
out of the body's natural
habitat, so to speak, you know.

19:54.602 --> 19:56.172
And?

19:56.205 --> 19:59.442
Well, fits our pattern.

19:59.475 --> 20:02.778
Red hair,
trauma to neck.

20:02.811 --> 20:05.081
Cause of death,
massive blood loss.

20:05.114 --> 20:06.648
But the difference here
is that this body's

20:06.681 --> 20:09.285
been here for two,
maybe three, days.

20:16.559 --> 20:19.262
When the guys got here,
they had to open the windows

20:19.295 --> 20:22.164
because the neighbors were
complaining about the smell.

20:23.798 --> 20:26.701
Was anyone seen
coming or going?

20:26.734 --> 20:27.970
They're out
canvassing the neighborhood,

20:28.003 --> 20:29.906
but I don't think so.

20:29.939 --> 20:32.408
How does someone come in,

20:32.441 --> 20:34.243
do something like this,
and no one notices?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.546
Well, that's
the kicker, isn't it?

20:36.579 --> 20:38.914
It's not just getting in.
How did he get out?

20:40.615 --> 20:41.984
What do you mean?

20:42.017 --> 20:44.753
When we got here,
they had to use a prybar

20:44.786 --> 20:47.557
to open the door, all right?

20:47.590 --> 20:50.792
Because everything:
windows, doors, everything,

20:50.825 --> 20:52.395
was locked from the inside.

20:52.428 --> 20:54.197
What about a key?

20:54.230 --> 20:56.899
She lived alone,

20:56.932 --> 20:58.733
has all the keys
in her possession

20:58.766 --> 21:00.303
and they're accounted for.

21:00.336 --> 21:03.339
And the landlord says that
no one else has any others.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.809
So you're telling me

21:07.842 --> 21:10.446
the perpetrator
entered a locked room

21:10.479 --> 21:12.048
without forced entry,

21:12.081 --> 21:16.018
viciously murdered a woman
and disappeared without a trace?

21:16.051 --> 21:18.921
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

21:18.954 --> 21:21.823
I just... for someone
to be able to do that,

21:21.856 --> 21:23.359
they'd have to be...

21:23.392 --> 21:24.960
Capable of the impossible.

21:27.129 --> 21:28.763
Impossible is an illusion

21:28.796 --> 21:31.300
that's created when
you have the advantage.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.636
And right now,
our killer has it.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.172
But he's only one person

21:36.205 --> 21:39.275
and what he's
not banking on is us.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.389
Good.

22:26.422 --> 22:28.157
You're awake.

22:36.131 --> 22:38.267
Do you understand
the implication here?

22:38.300 --> 22:40.670
It essentially proves
there's merit to my theory.

22:40.703 --> 22:42.572
What's he talking about?

22:42.605 --> 22:44.073
Don't start on this again.

22:45.441 --> 22:46.943
You said you wanted facts.

22:46.976 --> 22:49.111
Maybe it's time to start looking
at the ones you already have.

22:49.144 --> 22:50.580
The assailant is biting throats

22:50.613 --> 22:53.149
and somehow getting into
impossible rooms with ease.

22:53.182 --> 22:55.451
What does that
sound like to you?

22:55.484 --> 22:58.154
I have no idea.

22:58.187 --> 22:59.821
There's a strong
chance the perpetrator

22:59.854 --> 23:01.823
is in fact a vampire.

23:01.856 --> 23:03.159
Oh, how clever!

23:03.192 --> 23:04.560
Forget the
mythological connotations!

23:04.593 --> 23:07.063
Exsanguination
is found in several instances

23:07.096 --> 23:08.264
in the animal kingdom.

23:08.297 --> 23:09.865
It's therefore,
entirely probable

23:09.898 --> 23:11.300
that there's
a human equivalent!

23:11.333 --> 23:13.169
I get you're trying
to be helpful, Jonathan.

23:13.202 --> 23:16.738
But what you're suggesting
is not supported by reality.

23:16.771 --> 23:19.609
I would buy that the killer
thinks they're a vampire.

23:19.642 --> 23:22.044
But as for the real deal,
there's no such thing.

23:22.077 --> 23:24.880
Stories of vampires exist
in almost every culture.

23:24.913 --> 23:28.618
The jiangshi of China,
the sasabonsam of Ghana,

23:28.651 --> 23:30.253
the shtriga of Albania...

23:30.286 --> 23:32.688
all variants on
the same concept.

23:32.721 --> 23:34.991
If it was only folklore,
then how did all of those

23:35.024 --> 23:37.426
very different and
very distant places

23:37.459 --> 23:39.195
all arrive at
the same conclusion?

23:39.228 --> 23:42.064
Sociologically,
that's a wonderful argument.

23:42.097 --> 23:44.200
But real science
does not support it!

23:44.233 --> 23:49.138
Besides, vampires are supposed
to be dead, aren't they?

23:49.171 --> 23:49.939
Undead.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.574
Oh, well, there I have you.

23:51.607 --> 23:53.643
Bio-matter starts to decompose
almost immediately at death.

23:53.676 --> 23:55.978
So reanimation?
That's almost impossible.

23:56.011 --> 23:57.947
It's like a roll
of the dice, isn't it?

23:57.980 --> 23:59.348
Maybe that's why they
need to drink blood.

23:59.381 --> 24:01.350
Drink blood?
Bathe in blood!

24:01.383 --> 24:05.421
Those kind of unsciences, they
died in the Neolithic period!

24:05.454 --> 24:09.959
The point is, there's a very
logical explanation, Jonathan.

24:09.992 --> 24:12.528
The collection of blood
was cited in a number of

24:12.561 --> 24:16.265
very human, very real,
serial killer cases.

24:16.298 --> 24:18.601
And in each circumstance,
it was just a matter

24:18.634 --> 24:22.705
of figuring out which method
and tool was used to do so.

24:22.738 --> 24:23.706
I just think that...

24:23.739 --> 24:25.308
People are dying!

24:25.341 --> 24:27.476
The public are
demanding answers!

24:29.445 --> 24:32.348
I can't tell them
a vampire did it.

24:32.381 --> 24:37.253
And it would be great
if I could have you

24:37.286 --> 24:40.122
and your resources available

24:40.155 --> 24:41.490
to help me find
out who did.

24:43.425 --> 24:45.894
Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.

24:46.829 --> 24:48.297
Thank you.

24:49.465 --> 24:51.400
So what now?

24:51.433 --> 24:54.470
Well, you said you found some
saliva in the blood sample.

24:54.503 --> 24:56.939
You found something?

24:56.972 --> 24:59.208
We're talking miniscule traces.

24:59.241 --> 25:00.710
I missed it on
my first two passes,

25:00.743 --> 25:02.678
so I can understand why
you guys didn't catch it.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.013
Still, it could be something.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.281
And if it's our killer's saliva,

25:05.314 --> 25:07.516
it means that
he could be interacting

25:07.549 --> 25:11.654
with his victims in an up close,
possibly fetishistic way.

25:11.687 --> 25:13.055
Anything we can
glean from that?

25:13.088 --> 25:16.292
I don't know.
What do you think?

25:16.325 --> 25:18.861
Could you two compare notes and
tell me if you find anything?

25:18.894 --> 25:21.330
- Yeah, we could do that.
- Of course.

25:21.363 --> 25:22.431
Yeah.

25:22.464 --> 25:24.033
I'll do a little more
research tonight

25:24.066 --> 25:25.701
and drop off whatever
I have in the morning.

25:25.734 --> 25:30.306
Yes, which reminds me, I've got
a couple more bodies to look at.

25:30.339 --> 25:32.375
I'll probably be there
well into the morning.

25:32.408 --> 25:34.510
All right, I'll be on my way.

25:34.543 --> 25:36.379
Good luck.

25:36.412 --> 25:38.849
No. Let's find a more nurturing
way of saying goodnight

25:38.882 --> 25:41.484
like "I'll see you later."

25:41.517 --> 25:42.918
Bye.

25:45.654 --> 25:47.390
What about you?

25:47.423 --> 25:49.225
It's late.
I should go check in on Mina

25:49.258 --> 25:51.927
as I made an unceremonious exit
from dinner with her guest.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.429
In the chaos of everything,

25:53.462 --> 25:55.164
I didn't even get a
chance to ask about that.

25:55.197 --> 25:56.766
Sounds like things are
going well for her with work?

25:56.799 --> 25:58.200
Yeah.

25:58.233 --> 26:00.669
She landed a big client,
a foreign aristocrat type.

26:00.702 --> 26:02.838
He's looking for
property in the city.

26:02.871 --> 26:04.273
It's a real boost for her.

26:04.306 --> 26:05.941
You know how reserved
she can be.

26:05.974 --> 26:07.410
- That's great.
- Yeah.

26:07.443 --> 26:08.978
So long as I didn't
scare him away

26:09.011 --> 26:11.580
when I ran out of the house
in pursuit of a murderer.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.982
Well, I'd like to think
that's fuel

26:13.015 --> 26:14.283
for a lively
dinner conversation.

26:14.316 --> 26:16.085
No. He's a little posh.

26:16.118 --> 26:18.220
Not the type
to want gritty details.

26:18.253 --> 26:20.923
Well, I guess they can't
all be ghouls like us.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.859
Guess not.

26:22.892 --> 26:25.995
Jonathan,
we gotta find this guy.

26:26.028 --> 26:28.531
Every day that passes while
we're grasping at straws

26:28.564 --> 26:33.569
is another opportunity
for him to kill again.

26:33.602 --> 26:35.805
I've always known you to be
a dedicated investigator.

26:35.838 --> 26:39.341
But... and don't take
this the wrong way...

26:39.374 --> 26:41.143
I can't help but feel
you're a little bit more

26:41.176 --> 26:43.012
on edge about
this one than usual.

26:43.045 --> 26:45.581
Our killer is singling out
women with specific attributes

26:45.614 --> 26:47.750
and greeting them
with violence.

26:47.783 --> 26:50.152
I can understand why that
would strike a nerve.

26:50.185 --> 26:51.787
But as one of your
oldest friends,

26:51.820 --> 26:54.590
I wanna make sure you don't
internalize this too much.

26:54.623 --> 26:56.992
It wouldn't be good for you...
or the case.

26:57.025 --> 27:00.396
It's a little too late
not to internalize it, Jonathan.

27:00.429 --> 27:02.164
Someone is out there
othering women

27:02.197 --> 27:03.999
and killing them
for their otherness.

27:04.032 --> 27:05.501
For reasons of my existence,

27:05.534 --> 27:08.804
I find that a little hard
not to take personally.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.005
Of course.

27:11.206 --> 27:13.375
Look at that saliva.

27:13.408 --> 27:15.744
Get back to Jack with
anything you find.

27:15.777 --> 27:17.881
I'm gonna go home
and check in on Mina

27:17.914 --> 27:20.015
and go over all my documents.

27:20.048 --> 27:21.817
All right.

27:21.850 --> 27:23.218
You get some sleep, okay?

27:25.420 --> 27:27.556
No more dead women
on my watch.

27:27.589 --> 27:28.691
Got it?

27:28.724 --> 27:29.758
Got it.

27:53.849 --> 27:55.183
Mina?

28:13.036 --> 28:14.436
Hey!

29:05.854 --> 29:06.822
Amelia?

29:06.855 --> 29:08.090
Baby.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.026
Are you okay?

29:10.059 --> 29:11.327
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.896
What happened?

29:12.929 --> 29:14.496
There was someone in the house.

29:14.529 --> 29:15.631
What?

29:15.664 --> 29:17.266
- Are they... are you?
- I'm fine.

29:17.299 --> 29:19.301
They got away, though.

29:19.334 --> 29:20.703
My God, Amelia...

29:20.736 --> 29:24.439
Shh. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.343
I don't understand.

29:27.376 --> 29:29.812
Who did this?

29:29.845 --> 29:31.179
It's him.

29:32.180 --> 29:33.850
Him?

29:33.883 --> 29:36.518
The Count said the papers
mentioned me by name.

29:38.888 --> 29:39.889
What are you talking about?

29:39.922 --> 29:41.858
The killer from my case.

29:41.891 --> 29:43.392
He knows who I am.

29:43.425 --> 29:45.427
And tonight he wanted
to send me a message.

29:48.064 --> 29:49.297
He knows where we live.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.839
Well, how did they get in?

29:56.872 --> 29:58.641
Did they have a key?

29:58.674 --> 30:00.877
And you're sure
you found no significant

30:00.910 --> 30:02.778
evidence of forced entry?

30:02.811 --> 30:03.779
No.

30:03.812 --> 30:05.180
You know I know what
to look for.

30:05.213 --> 30:07.816
And you know I have to ask.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.251
I'm sorry.

30:09.284 --> 30:12.088
It's just...
he came into my home.

30:12.121 --> 30:14.223
What if I hadn't been here?

30:14.256 --> 30:16.026
And Mina...

30:16.059 --> 30:17.292
She's fine.

30:17.325 --> 30:20.462
Not fine, but she'll be okay.

30:20.495 --> 30:22.197
Just a bit startled.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.800
It's gonna be a rough night
sleep for both of us.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.535
Understandable.

30:26.568 --> 30:28.771
Did you at least get
a good look at him?

30:28.804 --> 30:30.106
No.

30:30.139 --> 30:31.573
Credit where credit's due,

30:31.606 --> 30:35.011
he knew to move fast
and stick to the shadows.

30:35.044 --> 30:36.512
If I didn't know any better,

30:36.545 --> 30:38.081
I would have thought
he was familiar with the house.

30:38.114 --> 30:39.214
Is that possible?

30:39.247 --> 30:40.850
Not likely.

30:40.883 --> 30:43.053
Besides Jonathan Harker and a
few women from the social club,

30:43.086 --> 30:45.354
we don't really have guests.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.355
Though there was Dracula.

30:48.891 --> 30:49.926
Dracula?

30:49.959 --> 30:52.294
A foreign Count that Mina
is helping

30:52.327 --> 30:54.097
acquire property in the city.

30:54.130 --> 30:55.597
He was here earlier for dinner.

30:56.999 --> 30:58.068
You don't think...

30:58.101 --> 30:59.501
No.

30:59.534 --> 31:01.770
Most aristocrats are not
known for their subtlety.

31:01.803 --> 31:05.207
So I doubt a stealthy
breaking and entering

31:05.240 --> 31:07.143
is in his repertoire.

31:07.176 --> 31:09.012
I suppose you're right,

31:09.045 --> 31:11.313
and he was vetted by
the partners in Mina's firm.

31:11.346 --> 31:13.582
And kind of glad he's here.

31:13.615 --> 31:17.386
It provides her
distraction from all this.

31:17.419 --> 31:20.389
You don't have
to say it, Amelia.

31:20.422 --> 31:21.757
I'm behind you.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.029
You do whatever it takes.

31:26.062 --> 31:27.663
Thank you, Captain.

31:27.696 --> 31:28.932
Of course.

31:28.965 --> 31:30.934
Well, I'm gonna
get these guys out of here

31:30.967 --> 31:32.634
so you can get some sleep.

32:18.915 --> 32:20.150
Are they gone?

32:20.183 --> 32:21.583
Yeah.

32:21.616 --> 32:23.518
The last officer just left.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.355
And?

32:26.388 --> 32:29.457
And I wish
I had answers for you,

32:30.425 --> 32:33.528
but I don't... not yet.

32:35.965 --> 32:38.100
This isn't supposed to happen.

32:39.801 --> 32:41.871
This shouldn't
be coming to our door.

32:41.904 --> 32:44.306
I'm supposed
to take care of you.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.776
Honey, you do take care of me.

32:47.809 --> 32:50.046
But tonight...

32:50.079 --> 32:54.050
Tonight, when danger came
looking, you chased it away.

32:54.083 --> 32:57.153
You went straight into battle
without a second thought.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.789
And that's the woman I know
and that's the woman I love.

33:00.822 --> 33:03.159
Mina...

33:03.192 --> 33:05.527
You take care of me, Amelia.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.130
You do so much.

33:07.163 --> 33:10.132
You take care of so many people.

33:11.833 --> 33:16.638
Sometimes you need to
let me take care of you.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.747
Baby...

33:26.848 --> 33:29.018
Shut up and let
me take care of you.

34:57.239 --> 34:58.573
Jonathan!

34:58.606 --> 34:59.641
Are you here to see Amelia?

34:59.674 --> 35:00.842
I haven't seen Amelia for a day.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.078
But I heard what
happened last night.

35:02.111 --> 35:03.545
And I just wanted to stop
by and check...

35:05.047 --> 35:06.882
Oh, sorry. I didn't
realize you had company.

35:07.950 --> 35:09.919
Oh, sorry, yes.

35:09.952 --> 35:14.057
Jonathan Harker,
this is Count Dracula.

35:14.090 --> 35:16.159
We're currently working
together to, hopefully

35:16.192 --> 35:18.060
find him a permanent
residence here in the city.

35:20.229 --> 35:21.830
It's an honor
and a pleasure, Count.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.336
And might I say,
with Mina here,

35:26.369 --> 35:29.072
I'm sure you'll get everything
you want and then some.

35:29.105 --> 35:31.174
The pleasure
is mine, Mr. Harker.

35:31.207 --> 35:34.609
And on the subject
of Miss Murray, we agree.

35:34.642 --> 35:37.080
She has been truly impressive.

35:37.113 --> 35:38.281
The Count and I
are going to look

35:38.314 --> 35:39.882
at a couple properties soon.

35:39.915 --> 35:42.986
And there's an old Abby
on the Carfax which, I think,

35:43.019 --> 35:46.222
with a little renovation, could
be quite a private residence.

35:46.255 --> 35:49.158
I know the place.
It's spectacular.

35:49.191 --> 35:52.128
Though isn't it getting a bit
late for property showings?

35:52.161 --> 35:54.263
That's my fault, I'm afraid.

35:54.296 --> 35:56.665
Much of my days are eaten up...

35:56.698 --> 35:57.967
Business matters.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.768
And so I had
to see it at night.

35:59.801 --> 36:02.604
I'm a bit of a night owl.

36:02.637 --> 36:04.606
Miss Murray was
incredibly kind to offer her

36:04.639 --> 36:06.242
time out of regular hours.

36:06.275 --> 36:07.609
It really was nothing.

36:07.642 --> 36:09.278
Jonathan, why don't you go
and have a seat

36:09.311 --> 36:11.347
and I'll let
Amelia know you're here?

36:11.380 --> 36:12.814
Don't have to tell me twice.

36:25.127 --> 36:28.797
So, you're a colleague
of Miss Van Helsing?

36:28.830 --> 36:31.334
Yes, I suppose so.

36:31.367 --> 36:33.870
Amelia and I have actually
been friends since childhood.

36:33.903 --> 36:37.907
She used to keep me out of trouble and
I used to distract her from her studies.

36:37.940 --> 36:41.010
Which is funny, 'cause now she's the
one always running towards trouble

36:41.043 --> 36:43.711
and I'm the one who always
has his nose in a book.

36:44.612 --> 36:46.548
Do you have an area of research?

36:46.581 --> 36:48.451
I'm a chemist, actually.

36:48.484 --> 36:50.752
I consult frequently
with Amelia and her colleagues

36:50.785 --> 36:53.923
on cases of specific
scientific curiosity.

36:55.191 --> 36:57.692
I do not envy
scientific research.

36:57.725 --> 37:00.296
A lot of dry reading there.

37:00.329 --> 37:05.600
I much prefer an evening sitting
with one of the classics.

37:05.633 --> 37:07.170
I can appreciate that.

37:07.203 --> 37:10.306
And definitely get the need
for more vibrant material.

37:12.575 --> 37:16.112
The bulk of my personal reading
is actually into occultism.

37:16.145 --> 37:17.880
How curious.

37:17.913 --> 37:19.215
Does that study
not contradict

37:19.248 --> 37:22.218
the steadfast rules
of your profession?

37:22.251 --> 37:23.618
Not really.

37:23.651 --> 37:25.321
In a lot of ways,
it informs it.

37:25.354 --> 37:28.590
Sometimes folklore and
myth can fill in the blanks

37:28.623 --> 37:30.326
when science can't.

37:30.359 --> 37:32.228
I find that exciting.

37:32.261 --> 37:35.697
I assume not all of your
colleagues share that sentiment.

37:35.730 --> 37:37.833
Sadly, no.

37:37.866 --> 37:40.369
But scientists who aren't
open to the unknown

37:40.402 --> 37:43.139
aren't really all that good
of scientists, are they?

37:43.172 --> 37:45.841
Hmm.

37:45.874 --> 37:47.977
For someone I just met,

37:48.010 --> 37:52.515
I must say you're quite
admirable, Jonathan Harker.

37:52.548 --> 37:54.783
Thanks.

37:54.816 --> 37:56.385
Amelia's just
finishing something.

37:56.418 --> 37:57.453
She'll be right out.

37:57.486 --> 37:58.554
Oh, great.

37:58.587 --> 38:00.755
Thanks, Mina.
Shall we depart?

38:00.788 --> 38:02.958
Yes, let's.
That'd be great.

38:17.473 --> 38:19.008
I gotta get some sleep.

38:22.178 --> 38:25.780
You know what?

38:25.813 --> 38:28.217
Jonathan is quite good
at what he does.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.085
Do you know that?

38:29.118 --> 38:30.752
I don't give him enough credit.

38:32.054 --> 38:34.223
There are some
interesting things.

38:35.723 --> 38:40.462
I mean, it doesn't explain
you or the killer or...

38:41.997 --> 38:44.266
Or why I'm talking
to dead bodies again.

38:45.534 --> 38:47.537
Shit.

38:47.570 --> 38:50.339
I should get myself
a small dog to run around here

38:50.372 --> 38:52.007
or maybe a canary...

38:56.778 --> 38:58.414
Wait a minute.

39:14.463 --> 39:16.065
I thought we agreed
you were gonna cool it

39:16.098 --> 39:17.533
with this paranormal
stuff for a bit.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.435
He didn't have
a reflection, Amelia!

39:19.468 --> 39:20.536
And?

39:20.569 --> 39:21.971
And that doesn't concern you?

39:22.004 --> 39:23.705
Especially based on lore
and what we talked about?

39:23.738 --> 39:25.274
No!

39:25.307 --> 39:26.775
Because I think you're seeing
things you want to see.

39:26.808 --> 39:28.876
I don't want to see it!
I did see it!

39:31.013 --> 39:32.515
You were on the couch, right?

39:32.548 --> 39:33.949
Sit down.

39:36.485 --> 39:39.788
If the mirror is at
an angle from where you are,

39:39.821 --> 39:42.124
you can see me now, right?

39:42.157 --> 39:43.758
Yes.

39:46.629 --> 39:47.762
And now?

39:50.499 --> 39:51.433
Jonathan?

39:53.469 --> 39:55.371
No.

39:55.404 --> 39:56.738
Exactly.

39:56.771 --> 40:00.710
You were seeing ghosts and
ghouls where there are none.

40:00.743 --> 40:03.446
You're right.
I'm sorry.

40:03.479 --> 40:05.548
I just really want this
to go well for her.

40:05.581 --> 40:08.251
It's the first time
I've seen Mina this excited

40:08.284 --> 40:09.352
about anything.

40:09.385 --> 40:10.819
That's true.

40:10.852 --> 40:13.222
She did seem to have a little
more pep to her step tonight.

40:13.255 --> 40:15.757
It's more than
just the work assignment.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.426
Ever since Mina was younger,

40:17.459 --> 40:20.429
she was bulled so relentlessly
for being different.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.465
Whether it her hair
or the way she dressed,

40:22.498 --> 40:25.134
she spent so many years
trying to change everything

40:25.167 --> 40:28.704
about who she was to be who she
thought people wanted her to be.

40:28.737 --> 40:30.406
And here's a circumstance

40:30.439 --> 40:32.275
where she's being valued for
who she is and what she does.

40:32.308 --> 40:33.442
Exactly.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.378
I always knew she had
a tough time of it.

40:35.411 --> 40:38.080
But I guess I never
really thought through

40:38.113 --> 40:39.915
how those things
tend to hang on.

40:39.948 --> 40:41.483
Be glad you never had to.

40:43.218 --> 40:45.588
So you said
you dropped off some new data

40:45.621 --> 40:47.290
to Jack on the way home?

40:47.323 --> 40:48.624
Yes.

40:48.657 --> 40:51.260
The saliva present in
the blood sample you provided,

40:51.293 --> 40:52.827
upon further investigation,

40:52.860 --> 40:55.097
showed the slightest trace
of a chemical anticoagulant.

40:55.130 --> 40:56.599
Like a blood thinner?

40:56.632 --> 40:58.401
Yes, more or less.

40:58.434 --> 41:00.703
That would explain
the extraction of that amount

41:00.736 --> 41:04.273
of blood without the body
attempting to clot to stop loss,

41:04.306 --> 41:07.176
but that leaves the question:

41:07.209 --> 41:09.844
how is the killer
administering it to his victims?

41:11.013 --> 41:13.449
And where has
all the blood gone?

41:13.482 --> 41:14.684
I don't know.

41:14.717 --> 41:17.053
That's more your
and Jack's department.

41:17.086 --> 41:18.554
I can identify the chemical,

41:18.587 --> 41:21.724
but how and why of it
might be above my pay grade.

41:25.527 --> 41:26.529
Hello?

41:26.562 --> 41:27.763
Amelia, it's Jack!

41:27.796 --> 41:29.031
Speak of the devil.

41:29.064 --> 41:31.534
No. Speak of the bat!

41:31.567 --> 41:33.703
I have some very interesting
things to tell you.

41:33.736 --> 41:35.404
When can you get here?

41:35.437 --> 41:37.106
- We're already on our way.
- Excellent!

41:47.649 --> 41:49.485
Seward?

41:49.518 --> 41:50.753
Oh, Captain...

41:50.786 --> 41:52.788
I got your message to come down.
What's going on?

41:52.821 --> 41:55.291
Well, we had an amazing
development this morning.

41:55.324 --> 41:57.460
From some of the blood
of one of the victims,

41:57.493 --> 42:00.162
we were able to find
the presence of saliva.

42:00.195 --> 42:02.631
And in the saliva,
there was an anticoagulant.

42:02.664 --> 42:03.866
Okay.

42:03.899 --> 42:06.302
Well, it reminded me something
that Amelia said.

42:06.335 --> 42:09.138
Amelia said something
about animals and stuff

42:09.171 --> 42:11.207
and I thought, well, there
are only certain animals

42:11.240 --> 42:13.142
that have the anticoagulant.

42:13.175 --> 42:16.946
And if you look here,
that would be bats...

42:16.979 --> 42:19.181
Oh!

42:31.360 --> 42:32.461
Why?

43:04.359 --> 43:05.494
Jack?

43:06.361 --> 43:08.964
Jack? We're here.

43:08.997 --> 43:11.400
Oh my God. Jack?

43:11.433 --> 43:13.436
Jack!
What happened?

43:13.469 --> 43:14.437
Jack!

43:14.470 --> 43:15.604
Get help!

43:15.637 --> 43:16.639
Jack?

43:16.672 --> 43:17.706
Re...

43:17.739 --> 43:19.542
I don't understand!

43:19.575 --> 43:22.111
Helps on the way!

43:22.144 --> 43:23.746
Stay with me, Jack, please!

43:23.779 --> 43:24.747
Please!

43:24.780 --> 43:26.615
It was... Renfield.

43:40.162 --> 43:41.463
Renfield!

43:52.174 --> 43:53.742
Looks like
he's fled the scene.

43:53.775 --> 43:56.278
Doesn't convince me
of his innocence.

43:58.814 --> 44:00.749
What are you doing?
Isn't this a crime scene?

44:00.782 --> 44:02.618
Yes. And if you recall,

44:02.651 --> 44:04.753
I'm the lead
investigator on the scene.

44:04.786 --> 44:07.022
And considering the fact
that we have a friend

44:07.055 --> 44:08.724
in critical
condition downstairs,

44:08.757 --> 44:11.059
I'm not inclined
to follow protocol.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.729
So if you don't mind...

44:16.164 --> 44:18.067
Locked.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.568
Ah-ha.

44:20.636 --> 44:21.570
What is this?

44:30.546 --> 44:31.514
Oh, my God!

44:31.547 --> 44:32.949
What?

44:32.982 --> 44:37.219
These files...
they're records, passports,

44:38.287 --> 44:40.322
Licenses,
personal information...

44:40.355 --> 44:42.558
All of women matching
the killer's target type.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.629
Red hair...
all women with red hair.

44:49.097 --> 44:51.133
This doesn't prove
anything, right?

44:51.166 --> 44:54.436
The captain of the police would
have files on murder victims.

44:54.469 --> 44:57.739
Yeah, which is why
I recognize the first few.

44:59.107 --> 45:01.710
The problem is,

45:01.743 --> 45:06.850
a lot of these women
aren't victims... yet.

45:06.883 --> 45:09.785
This isn't paperwork
after the fact.

45:09.818 --> 45:11.888
It's a hit list!

45:11.921 --> 45:13.088
- Where are you going?
- I'm going after him!

45:13.121 --> 45:14.423
Amelia, look!

45:14.456 --> 45:16.158
I understand, but
we should call someone

45:16.191 --> 45:17.560
like Interpol or something!

45:17.593 --> 45:21.865
Maybe, but we don't
have time for red tape.

45:21.898 --> 45:23.900
- Right, but...
- Look!

45:23.933 --> 45:26.268
Jack found something that
incriminated the murderer,

45:26.301 --> 45:28.304
and Renfield tried
to kill him for it!

45:28.337 --> 45:31.106
That tells me that
Renfield is either

45:31.139 --> 45:33.642
the man responsible
or knows who is.

45:33.675 --> 45:36.712
And every second we waste
puts someone else in danger.

45:36.745 --> 45:38.247
- I'll come with you.
- No!

45:38.280 --> 45:39.916
I'll check his house.

45:39.949 --> 45:42.151
I may be able to reason with
him, but only if I go alone.

45:42.184 --> 45:43.686
Take those files to your office

45:43.719 --> 45:45.788
and see if there's
anything we've missed.

45:45.821 --> 45:47.991
Amelia...

45:48.024 --> 45:49.324
Be careful!

45:54.931 --> 45:56.231
Renfield!

46:11.948 --> 46:14.483
If you're gonna pull
that trigger,

46:14.516 --> 46:18.387
you better be damn certain
you do it faster than I do.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.755
Why'd you do it, Captain?

46:21.523 --> 46:23.359
Your cover's blown.

46:23.392 --> 46:25.194
At least help me understand.

46:25.227 --> 46:27.897
You could never understand.

46:27.930 --> 46:31.901
It is knowledge that is not
meant for the likes of you.

46:31.934 --> 46:34.737
You attacked Jack...

46:34.770 --> 46:38.008
and those women
are dead because of you!

46:38.041 --> 46:42.411
You've perverted everything
we're supposed to stand for!

46:42.444 --> 46:45.648
And what if everything
we stand for is irrelevant?

46:45.681 --> 46:49.218
Because the truth
of what's really out there

46:49.251 --> 46:51.921
is too terrible for
us to comprehend.

46:53.890 --> 46:55.025
You're sick!

46:55.058 --> 46:56.993
No, Van Helsing.

46:57.026 --> 47:03.265
For the first time in my life,
I'm finally aware.

47:04.967 --> 47:07.169
What happened to you?

47:07.202 --> 47:10.172
The inevitable.

47:10.205 --> 47:13.342
And it will
happen to you, too!

47:24.020 --> 47:27.456
You told me to catch
the killer at any cost...

47:29.725 --> 47:30.726
And I did.

48:27.482 --> 48:29.018
Sorry, Amelia.

48:44.533 --> 48:46.835
A familiar...

48:46.868 --> 48:48.470
Of course!

48:48.503 --> 48:50.039
Renfield's not the killer.

48:50.072 --> 48:52.909
He's harvesting victims
for the killer.

50:15.258 --> 50:17.559
I hoped I'd find you here.

50:17.592 --> 50:19.162
Good guess.

50:19.195 --> 50:20.529
Not really.

50:20.562 --> 50:21.898
You're still the better
detective.

50:21.931 --> 50:23.900
I tried your house first
and the station.

50:23.933 --> 50:26.401
Finally, dispatch told me
this is where I should look.

50:26.434 --> 50:28.704
They're not supposed to do that.

50:28.737 --> 50:30.273
I'd like to tell
you some...

50:30.306 --> 50:32.507
I killed him, Jonathan.

50:32.540 --> 50:34.176
My own superior officer.

50:35.644 --> 50:37.881
A man that I looked up to.

50:37.914 --> 50:40.884
A man that I thought I knew.

50:40.917 --> 50:44.486
What would bring someone
to do something like this?

50:44.519 --> 50:46.421
He killed all those people

50:46.454 --> 50:50.392
and came to work every day
pretending to look for himself.

50:50.425 --> 50:52.460
It's deranged.

50:54.562 --> 50:55.899
I think it's more than that.

50:55.932 --> 50:57.432
What are you talking about?

50:57.465 --> 50:58.600
I don't know that Renfield
was acting entirely

50:58.633 --> 51:01.271
of his own accord.

51:01.304 --> 51:03.306
You see, there's this
thing called a "familiar"

51:03.339 --> 51:04.706
where a vampire entrances you...

51:04.739 --> 51:07.709
Jonathan, I asked you...

51:07.742 --> 51:11.281
I begged you not to go there!

51:11.314 --> 51:14.683
Do you understand that
I had to kill a man tonight?

51:15.952 --> 51:19.155
A man that I looked up to
and always trusted

51:19.188 --> 51:21.024
- to do the right thing.
- It doesn't add up, Amelia,

51:21.057 --> 51:22.892
and you're a good enough
detective to know that!

51:23.993 --> 51:25.694
Renfield may
have attacked Seward.

51:25.727 --> 51:27.796
But that in no way matches
any of the other murders.

51:27.829 --> 51:29.198
It doesn't explain
the neck wound

51:29.231 --> 51:30.599
or the anticoagulant

51:30.632 --> 51:33.468
or what exactly Jack
found that set him off.

51:33.501 --> 51:34.770
But the file...

51:34.803 --> 51:36.406
Oh, I think
he's gathering a list...

51:36.439 --> 51:40.209
for someone else,
someone who could tear throats

51:40.242 --> 51:41.945
and make them bleed
without clotting,

51:41.978 --> 51:43.712
someone who would gladly
take a tailored list

51:43.745 --> 51:46.015
provided by the one person
who could give him one.

51:46.048 --> 51:47.283
I just...

51:47.316 --> 51:50.052
A tailored list that
includes the woman you love!

52:20.149 --> 52:22.452
Seward stumbled onto
something that caused Renfield

52:22.485 --> 52:23.987
to attack in a state of panic.

52:24.020 --> 52:25.154
And that just
doesn't fit the pattern

52:25.187 --> 52:26.923
up to this point,
and you know it.

52:26.956 --> 52:29.892
Your killer's shown nothing
but cool calculation,

52:29.925 --> 52:31.260
not to mention the fact
that you knew

52:31.293 --> 52:32.862
the victim profile matched.

52:32.895 --> 52:34.096
Mina.

52:43.538 --> 52:44.974
She's gone!

52:48.310 --> 52:52.181
Okay, panicking
won't help us find Mina.

52:52.214 --> 52:54.884
We have to think
about this logically.

52:54.917 --> 52:56.551
I just don't understand.

52:56.584 --> 52:59.821
If Renfield's dead, that
means that you might be right

52:59.854 --> 53:02.225
in the fact that
he could be providing

53:02.258 --> 53:05.128
information to the killer.

53:05.161 --> 53:06.561
Oh, my God.

53:06.594 --> 53:08.931
That means that the intruder
that I thought was here for me

53:08.964 --> 53:11.533
was actually here for Mina

53:11.566 --> 53:13.835
because they know about her.

53:13.868 --> 53:15.138
Why didn't you say
anything

53:15.171 --> 53:17.106
about the fact she
matched the profile?

53:17.139 --> 53:19.409
I didn't say anything because
I didn't think anyone knew.

53:19.442 --> 53:21.911
She didn't want anyone to know.

53:21.944 --> 53:23.179
When she was bullied
when she was younger,

53:23.212 --> 53:24.713
they teased her
about her red hair.

53:24.746 --> 53:25.982
That's awful.

53:26.015 --> 53:28.017
She didn't want
to change her core.

53:28.050 --> 53:29.452
But she could change
her hair and she did.

53:29.485 --> 53:33.423
because it gave her that
small measure of control.

53:33.456 --> 53:37.160
Jonathan, I have to find this
guy and I have to find him now!

53:37.193 --> 53:38.428
Okay, but how?

53:38.461 --> 53:39.795
Where do we start?

53:39.828 --> 53:42.198
The crimes followed
a distinct trajectory

53:42.231 --> 53:44.233
until Renfield was presented
with something

53:44.266 --> 53:47.136
that spooked him enough
to deviate from the pattern.

53:47.169 --> 53:48.837
Right.

53:48.870 --> 53:50.839
And when he attacked Jack,
that cast enough

53:50.872 --> 53:52.308
suspicion of guilt
in his direction

53:52.341 --> 53:54.776
and I went after him
on intuition.

53:54.809 --> 53:56.512
But that triggering evidence
is still out there

53:56.545 --> 53:59.949
and could be the key, which
means we need to talk to...

53:59.982 --> 54:00.983
Jack!

54:02.184 --> 54:03.618
Jack, are you sure
you're up to this?

54:03.651 --> 54:04.954
Oh, that's not the worst thing

54:04.987 --> 54:06.655
that's happened
to me this evening.

54:06.688 --> 54:07.789
Okay, so...

54:07.822 --> 54:09.459
No, no, no.

54:09.492 --> 54:15.164
The anticoagulant in the saliva,
it's not an external agent.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.768
What I mean is,

54:19.801 --> 54:23.106
whoever or whatever that
saliva belongs to,

54:23.139 --> 54:28.111
they're biologically secreting
the anticoagulant themselves.

54:28.144 --> 54:30.079
It's not a drug
or a stimulant

54:30.112 --> 54:32.714
that they've purchased
and they've ingested.

54:32.747 --> 54:35.985
It's literally
being manufactured

54:36.018 --> 54:38.154
inside them naturally.

54:38.187 --> 54:40.022
Is that something
people can even do?

54:40.055 --> 54:45.660
Science would say no, but
there are specific animals

54:45.693 --> 54:49.764
that can secrete
this anticoagulant

54:49.797 --> 54:53.002
- and yes, most of them are...
- Bats.

54:53.035 --> 54:54.971
- like you said on the phone.
- Exactly.

54:55.004 --> 54:58.307
They secrete the anticoagulant
so that they can feast

54:58.340 --> 55:02.345
on much larger animals
at will uninterrupted.

55:02.378 --> 55:06.282
They slash the flesh and
then they have their fill.

55:06.315 --> 55:08.017
And, uh...

55:08.050 --> 55:13.322
Sometimes when the prey
is much smaller than them,

55:13.355 --> 55:17.894
the end result is not unlike
our poor young ladies.

55:17.927 --> 55:21.264
Okay, but...

55:21.297 --> 55:25.034
Once I made
the saliva connection,

55:25.067 --> 55:28.670
I did some research based on
the bite pattern on our victims.

55:28.703 --> 55:32.141
And I was able to find a match.

55:32.174 --> 55:33.943
And what breed of bat was that?

55:33.976 --> 55:35.744
Oh, don't be so smug!

55:35.777 --> 55:38.347
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

55:38.380 --> 55:39.714
Vampire.

55:40.616 --> 55:43.386
Okay.

55:43.419 --> 55:46.589
But there's no such thing
as a human-sized vampire bat.

55:46.622 --> 55:48.024
Well...

55:48.057 --> 55:50.792
There are centuries
of vampire myths and lore,

55:50.825 --> 55:53.062
which our killer
could be relying on

55:53.095 --> 55:55.298
to perpetuate his crimes.

55:55.331 --> 55:57.133
And since you've been able
to look at this case

55:57.166 --> 55:59.768
in a way I haven't,
I need to know what's next.

55:59.801 --> 56:01.504
- I...
- I want to be clear.

56:01.537 --> 56:05.241
I'm not saying that
I think it's a vampire.

56:05.274 --> 56:07.043
But based on what we're seeing,

56:07.076 --> 56:08.911
it is possible that he's
convinced himself that he is.

56:08.944 --> 56:10.379
And he's using that illusion...

56:10.412 --> 56:14.716
No. That would not explain
the presence of the...

56:14.749 --> 56:16.185
The anticoagulant
in the saliva.

56:16.218 --> 56:17.553
Exactly.

56:17.586 --> 56:20.223
Yeah, but if I have to think
that way to get Mina back,

56:20.256 --> 56:22.424
then I need to know what now?

56:26.395 --> 56:29.966
Well, we'd have
to consult my texts.

56:29.999 --> 56:32.501
Then that's what we'll do.

56:32.534 --> 56:34.270
Jack, thank you.

56:35.504 --> 56:38.407
Amelia...

56:38.440 --> 56:40.842
Get this son of a bitch.

56:40.875 --> 56:42.177
Bring her back.

57:00.729 --> 57:02.431
Anything worthwhile?

57:02.464 --> 57:03.733
I don't know.

57:03.766 --> 57:05.167
Maybe.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.369
At the very least,
I think I may have

57:06.402 --> 57:08.904
fleshed out my theory
about Renfield.

57:08.937 --> 57:10.172
You remember
how I said I thought

57:10.205 --> 57:12.942
he might be a "familiar"?

57:12.975 --> 57:14.977
Lore suggests that it's
a common practice

57:15.010 --> 57:17.246
for the undead to entrance
a living servant

57:17.279 --> 57:19.048
to provide them with
what they need,

57:19.081 --> 57:22.585
often unbeknownst to
the entranced themselves.

57:22.618 --> 57:24.253
Doesn't make me feel better.

57:24.286 --> 57:26.322
Well, what it suggests is
that whoever's behind this

57:26.355 --> 57:28.157
knows exactly
what they're doing.

57:28.190 --> 57:30.026
Not only were they able to
get a direct bead

57:30.059 --> 57:32.361
on potential victims
via Renfield's access,

57:32.394 --> 57:34.063
but also who better than
the head of

57:34.096 --> 57:35.264
the police department
to help control

57:35.297 --> 57:36.932
the tide of information
about the case?

57:36.965 --> 57:38.467
Credit where credit's due.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.936
And if that's true,
that means they were able

57:40.969 --> 57:42.138
to bring the papers on
a wild goose chase

57:42.171 --> 57:44.140
about this
being a copycat killer.

57:44.173 --> 57:45.608
Well, I mean, it makes sense.

57:45.641 --> 57:47.476
What better way to
misdirect than point everyone

57:47.509 --> 57:50.212
in an absolutely
preposterous direction?

57:50.245 --> 57:51.180
Right.

57:52.581 --> 57:53.515
Unless...

57:54.950 --> 57:56.485
Unless?

57:56.518 --> 58:00.323
Unless that's exactly
what they want us to think.

58:00.356 --> 58:03.259
What if the best place
to hide is in plain sight?

58:03.292 --> 58:07.763
Present something as impossible,
make it seem sensationalized?

58:07.796 --> 58:12.101
And those who value the truth
won't even consider it.

58:12.134 --> 58:13.669
And why would you think that?

58:13.702 --> 58:15.604
Because I didn't.

58:15.637 --> 58:17.740
And if this person
thinks they're a vampire,

58:17.773 --> 58:20.309
they may also believe
that they're carrying out

58:20.342 --> 58:21.911
the killings of
the original killer.

58:21.944 --> 58:25.748
Or they think that they are
the original killer themselves.

58:25.781 --> 58:27.650
You may be onto something.

58:27.683 --> 58:29.285
Present something so plainly,

58:29.318 --> 58:31.520
people dismiss it outright
for being too obvious!

58:31.553 --> 58:33.689
Like how you and Jack
dismissed my vampire theory!

58:33.722 --> 58:37.059
Okay. To be honest,
vampires as an answer

58:37.092 --> 58:38.494
is the exact
opposite of obvious.

58:39.828 --> 58:41.364
What are you getting?

58:41.397 --> 58:43.332
Now I'm assuming,
because you're a good detective,

58:43.365 --> 58:45.434
that even though you
dismissed it as a possibility,

58:45.467 --> 58:47.603
you still looked into the
murders from a century ago?

58:47.636 --> 58:49.605
The police reports
didn't have much, to be honest.

58:49.638 --> 58:53.042
Something about a trail
of bodies and a land dispute

58:53.075 --> 58:55.444
and the castle
outside the city.

58:55.477 --> 58:57.646
It didn't make sense
to connect it to this case.

58:57.679 --> 59:01.684
That's because you were relying
on fact and not on legend.

59:01.717 --> 59:05.221
Now, I'm not overly familiar
with this particular story.

59:05.254 --> 59:08.023
But I do remember some
of the broad strokes.

59:08.056 --> 59:10.059
Something about a prince
or a nobleman

59:10.092 --> 59:11.394
who absolutely lost it
on his wedding day

59:11.427 --> 59:13.462
and went on a killing spree.

59:13.495 --> 59:15.330
Kind of standard basis
of haunting stuff.

59:18.634 --> 59:19.870
Oh, here we go.

59:19.903 --> 59:21.337
I was right.

59:21.370 --> 59:23.939
According to this,
an aristocrat was set

59:23.972 --> 59:26.942
to be married to the love
of his life.

59:26.975 --> 59:28.744
But due to an
unfortunate illness,

59:28.777 --> 59:32.681
she died the same day
they were due to be wed.

59:32.714 --> 59:34.917
How terrible...

59:34.950 --> 59:36.786
Apparently, the tragedy
led him slipping

59:36.819 --> 59:38.187
into a deranged madness.

59:38.220 --> 59:40.156
And he started
lashing out and killing anyone

59:40.189 --> 59:41.557
who reminded him
of his lost love.

59:43.725 --> 59:45.261
I don't think
there are any photos.

59:45.294 --> 59:47.963
But... the family name is...

59:50.466 --> 59:51.600
Dracula.

59:51.633 --> 59:53.068
Oh, wow!

59:53.101 --> 59:54.837
I knew I didn't
see his reflection!

59:54.870 --> 59:56.172
Amelia, you don't think...

59:56.205 --> 59:57.473
Okay, all right.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.541
There's no pictures of him.

1:00:02.311 --> 1:00:04.480
But there is a painting
of his dead fiancé.

1:00:06.682 --> 1:00:08.984
We have to find Mina now!

1:00:09.017 --> 1:00:10.453
We have to wait
until the morning!

1:00:10.486 --> 1:00:11.855
Dracula will be
much weaker then!

1:00:11.888 --> 1:00:13.556
I can't wait until then.

1:00:13.589 --> 1:00:16.091
Who knows what will happen
to her if we wait that long?

1:00:16.124 --> 1:00:17.459
Let's move.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.709
Hotel Le Carmilla.

1:00:33.742 --> 1:00:35.744
This is the place
Renfield had a key to.

1:00:43.218 --> 1:00:44.553
I think this is it.

1:00:46.054 --> 1:00:47.756
Maybe we should
call in backup.

1:00:47.789 --> 1:00:49.358
Can't call in backup.

1:00:49.391 --> 1:00:52.828
Besides, we're here based
on circumstantial evidence

1:00:52.861 --> 1:00:54.965
of a giant vampire bat.

1:00:54.998 --> 1:00:56.465
For some reason,
I don't think

1:00:56.498 --> 1:00:58.534
they're gonna
spare the resources.

1:00:59.768 --> 1:01:01.470
And what if we find him?

1:01:01.503 --> 1:01:04.373
If Dracula is the descendant
of the mad aristocrat...

1:01:04.406 --> 1:01:06.041
Or the aristocrat himself?

1:01:06.074 --> 1:01:09.712
Then he's either finishing
the work of his family

1:01:09.745 --> 1:01:12.181
or he knows who is.

1:01:12.214 --> 1:01:14.349
Either way, that can
lead us to Mina.

1:01:15.584 --> 1:01:18.520
So we're gonna go in there
and ask nicely.

1:01:19.821 --> 1:01:23.927
And if he doesn't cooperate,
not so nicely.

1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.527
That's what I was afraid
you were going to say.

1:01:37.205 --> 1:01:38.740
I think it's this one.

1:01:43.012 --> 1:01:45.147
I thought there'd be more
security or something.

1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:47.918
Guards would draw attention.

1:01:47.951 --> 1:01:52.956
This is exactly like the copycat
case, hiding in plain sight.

1:01:52.989 --> 1:01:56.191
People won't suspect something
that looks totally normal.

1:01:57.793 --> 1:01:59.861
But be ready when we
get in Dracula's room.

1:02:44.373 --> 1:02:45.942
What do we do?

1:02:45.975 --> 1:02:47.409
I don't know...

1:02:51.246 --> 1:02:52.748
Amelia.

1:02:55.417 --> 1:02:57.386
You're here.

1:03:08.163 --> 1:03:10.000
Renfield?

1:03:10.033 --> 1:03:12.267
That's impossible.

1:03:20.842 --> 1:03:22.544
Hey! Put her down!

1:03:30.019 --> 1:03:31.553
What is this place?

1:03:31.586 --> 1:03:33.589
What did you do to these people?

1:03:33.622 --> 1:03:35.892
You should never have
come here, Amelia!

1:03:35.925 --> 1:03:38.627
I killed you once
and I'll do it again.

1:03:44.266 --> 1:03:47.103
You were a good
detective, Amelia.

1:03:47.136 --> 1:03:49.973
But chase death enough,

1:03:50.006 --> 1:03:53.542
eventually you'll find it.

1:03:53.575 --> 1:03:58.247
And now it's time to become

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:01.885
an officer of
a different rank...

1:04:01.918 --> 1:04:03.752
Hey, Captain!

1:04:10.159 --> 1:04:11.427
What was that?

1:04:11.460 --> 1:04:12.761
Holy water.

1:04:12.794 --> 1:04:14.329
Believe me now?

1:04:20.169 --> 1:04:22.371
Blood!
They smell it!

1:04:22.404 --> 1:04:24.506
No!
No, that won't work!

1:04:24.539 --> 1:04:26.375
Here, hit their hearts.

1:04:26.408 --> 1:04:27.443
Don't get bit!

1:04:27.476 --> 1:04:28.878
Oh, is that all?

1:04:47.529 --> 1:04:49.264
Thank you, doctor.

1:04:56.338 --> 1:04:57.940
Hello?
Is somebody there?

1:05:01.309 --> 1:05:03.445
Dr. Seward, I presume?

1:05:04.914 --> 1:05:07.050
Yes. That's me.

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:09.986
It's a shame we should meet
under these circumstances.

1:05:10.019 --> 1:05:11.754
As I've been told,
you're actually

1:05:11.787 --> 1:05:15.158
quite a brilliant man,
unfortunately.

1:05:15.191 --> 1:05:18.794
Brilliance is often
an impediment to what I do

1:05:18.827 --> 1:05:21.630
and I don't like loose ends.

1:05:39.215 --> 1:05:40.716
If you give me your blood,

1:05:40.749 --> 1:05:43.920
I can give you pleasure
beyond your wildest dreams!

1:05:46.421 --> 1:05:48.891
Jonathan!
Get clear!

1:05:50.725 --> 1:05:52.527
Ah!

1:05:54.964 --> 1:05:56.398
Are you okay?

1:05:59.035 --> 1:05:59.969
Yeah.

1:06:01.037 --> 1:06:02.337
You?

1:06:02.370 --> 1:06:04.540
Yeah. I...

1:06:08.978 --> 1:06:10.947
You!

1:06:10.980 --> 1:06:13.648
I could say the same.

1:06:20.355 --> 1:06:21.623
Ah!

1:06:21.656 --> 1:06:23.491
Jonathan!

1:06:26.929 --> 1:06:28.430
Where's Mina?

1:06:28.463 --> 1:06:30.532
What did you do with her?

1:06:30.565 --> 1:06:34.170
Miss Murray is no longer
your concern, Detective.

1:06:34.203 --> 1:06:38.107
I appreciate you looked
after her all these years.

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:41.843
And for that, I had
considered letting you live.

1:06:43.012 --> 1:06:46.448
But you have made
a pest of yourself,

1:06:46.481 --> 1:06:48.650
killed my servant.

1:06:48.683 --> 1:06:51.353
And that's not very
amenable to me.

1:06:51.386 --> 1:06:52.654
Sorry to put a crimp
in your evening.

1:06:52.687 --> 1:06:55.325
And I'm sorry
to put one in yours

1:06:55.358 --> 1:06:59.295
but your interference ends
in my affairs tonight.

1:06:59.328 --> 1:07:01.898
You surely must have known,

1:07:01.931 --> 1:07:04.600
once you've
discovered the truth,

1:07:04.633 --> 1:07:07.136
there'll be no going back.

1:07:07.169 --> 1:07:10.472
A fact your dear Dr. Seward

1:07:10.505 --> 1:07:12.808
unfortunately learned
the hard way.

1:07:12.841 --> 1:07:13.742
Jack!

1:07:13.775 --> 1:07:14.810
What did you do to him?

1:07:14.843 --> 1:07:16.678
You already know the answer.

1:07:16.711 --> 1:07:19.148
Now it's your turn!

1:07:21.284 --> 1:07:23.818
So reliant on your toys.

1:07:25.854 --> 1:07:27.656
I'm not like the others.

1:07:28.556 --> 1:07:31.560
They were young, weak,

1:07:31.593 --> 1:07:33.729
dependent on
the pitiful modernity

1:07:33.762 --> 1:07:36.498
that's coursed
through their veins.

1:07:36.531 --> 1:07:39.668
I am old, powerful,

1:07:39.701 --> 1:07:42.437
enriched by
the blood of centuries.

1:07:42.470 --> 1:07:47.776
It's foolish to think
that after all these years,

1:07:47.809 --> 1:07:52.282
I'd give her up
to the likes of you.

1:07:52.315 --> 1:07:53.448
You're him!

1:07:54.849 --> 1:07:56.718
You're not a descendant.

1:07:57.954 --> 1:08:00.588
You're the nobleman
whose fiancé died.

1:08:02.124 --> 1:08:04.493
I'm sorry for your loss.

1:08:04.526 --> 1:08:08.663
But killing all those women
doesn't make you sympathetic.

1:08:10.465 --> 1:08:12.668
It makes you a monster!

1:08:12.701 --> 1:08:15.305
And it wont bring her back.

1:08:15.338 --> 1:08:17.439
They're not her.

1:08:17.472 --> 1:08:19.241
Mina's not her.

1:08:21.344 --> 1:08:22.644
You can't cheat death.

1:08:24.313 --> 1:08:25.882
Then explain me.

1:08:56.644 --> 1:08:58.580
What are you going to do to me?

1:08:58.613 --> 1:09:00.016
Do to you?

1:09:02.184 --> 1:09:07.822
My dear, I've searched
for you across the years.

1:09:09.824 --> 1:09:12.462
Now that I've found you,

1:09:12.495 --> 1:09:14.629
why would I put
that in jeopardy?

1:09:18.467 --> 1:09:19.701
You're not going to kill me?

1:09:21.337 --> 1:09:25.141
Not yet, and not permanently.

1:09:27.842 --> 1:09:29.379
But the others...

1:09:29.412 --> 1:09:34.317
Pale imitations that
tarnished your legacy,

1:09:34.350 --> 1:09:37.186
cruel reminders of
what was no longer.

1:09:38.487 --> 1:09:39.889
They had to go.

1:09:42.291 --> 1:09:46.228
But you... you stand apart,

1:09:47.729 --> 1:09:51.167
a mirror's reflection
of the woman I know,

1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:53.302
the woman you are.

1:09:53.335 --> 1:09:58.941
Of all of them, only
you are her exact likeness.

1:10:00.575 --> 1:10:05.048
When I saw you, I somehow knew,

1:10:05.081 --> 1:10:10.186
but I had to be sure,
needed to see for myself.

1:10:11.487 --> 1:10:14.756
Luckily, the partners
at your firm obliged.

1:10:17.659 --> 1:10:19.328
It was all a lie?

1:10:19.361 --> 1:10:22.331
It was a necessary means
to find the truth.

1:10:24.133 --> 1:10:27.203
You may not remember
who or what you are...

1:10:28.870 --> 1:10:30.039
but you will.

1:10:31.107 --> 1:10:32.674
No... No.

1:10:32.707 --> 1:10:35.744
I've been so very patient,

1:10:35.777 --> 1:10:38.181
but it is time
our courtship ends.

1:10:38.214 --> 1:10:42.318
There's only a few more hours
left of night you will rest.

1:10:42.351 --> 1:10:44.454
And before the sun rises,

1:10:44.487 --> 1:10:50.159
I will restore you to be by
my side once again forever.

1:10:52.827 --> 1:10:54.530
But for now...

1:10:54.563 --> 1:10:56.198
my dear Miss Murray...

1:10:59.502 --> 1:11:00.802
sleep.

1:11:21.524 --> 1:11:23.292
Jonathan?

1:11:42.144 --> 1:11:43.246
Jonathan...

1:11:43.279 --> 1:11:45.414
I'm okay. Oh!
All right, maybe not.

1:11:50.386 --> 1:11:52.388
We need to figure out
our next steps.

1:11:56.258 --> 1:11:57.993
I just don't
know where to begin.

1:11:59.495 --> 1:12:01.397
That's because you
are relying on fact!

1:12:01.430 --> 1:12:02.932
And not on legend..

1:12:02.965 --> 1:12:05.134
They're comparing this
to a 100-year-old case.

1:12:05.167 --> 1:12:07.702
You've got to admit, a
century-old mass murder case

1:12:07.735 --> 1:12:09.704
that ended at a creepy castle,

1:12:09.737 --> 1:12:12.707
that's the kind of stuff that
whets the appetite...

1:12:12.740 --> 1:12:13.909
The castle...

1:12:16.579 --> 1:12:18.014
We should get help.

1:12:18.047 --> 1:12:19.814
No. We can't wait that long.

1:12:19.847 --> 1:12:21.217
We have to find her
before he does

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:22.952
whatever he intends with her.

1:12:25.254 --> 1:12:28.457
My study. We can get
everything we need there.

1:12:32.827 --> 1:12:34.230
It's all right.

1:13:54.543 --> 1:13:56.145
Which way?

1:13:56.178 --> 1:13:58.581
There should be a staircase off
the main chamber that leads...

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:03.452
You shouldn't have come.

1:14:05.087 --> 1:14:08.124
While I admire your conviction,

1:14:08.157 --> 1:14:10.893
and am impressed that
you survived our meeting

1:14:10.926 --> 1:14:14.597
earlier this evening, know
that it will not happen again.

1:14:16.831 --> 1:14:19.902
- Do you...
- I see them.

1:14:19.935 --> 1:14:22.071
It's pointless to resist.

1:14:22.104 --> 1:14:25.107
You're profoundly injured,
Mr. Harker.

1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:30.613
And, Amelia, my dear,
your blood betrays you.

1:14:30.646 --> 1:14:34.517
If you are so sure, come and
fight me yourself, you coward!

1:14:34.550 --> 1:14:38.154
Such taunts are beneath you,
Miss Van Helsing.

1:14:38.187 --> 1:14:41.757
And I grow tired of
your distractions.

1:14:41.790 --> 1:14:43.592
Where's Mina?

1:14:43.625 --> 1:14:45.461
She was yours.

1:14:45.494 --> 1:14:46.995
Now she's mine.

1:14:47.896 --> 1:14:51.567
Then again, she always was.

1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.803
Time to let go.

1:14:53.836 --> 1:14:57.606
Of course, I'm happy to help
with that process.

1:14:58.941 --> 1:15:00.442
Finish them!

1:15:02.778 --> 1:15:04.180
Don't let him get away!
I'll hold them off!

1:15:04.213 --> 1:15:06.248
- I'm not leaving you!
- Go!

1:15:20.963 --> 1:15:22.631
Come and face me, you monster!

1:16:20.956 --> 1:16:22.191
Mina?

1:16:24.026 --> 1:16:25.694
Mina?

1:16:25.727 --> 1:16:27.729
Baby, it's Amelia.

1:16:28.864 --> 1:16:30.366
Mina...

1:16:30.399 --> 1:16:31.902
Mina?

1:16:31.935 --> 1:16:34.269
Mina, wake up!

1:16:35.737 --> 1:16:37.573
Oh, thank God!

1:16:37.606 --> 1:16:41.376
I'd ask that you refrain from
using that name in my house.

1:16:51.487 --> 1:16:52.923
Don't you think
we've had enough

1:16:52.956 --> 1:16:55.458
of this charade,
Miss Van Helsing?

1:16:55.491 --> 1:17:00.529
It was a noble effort, but now
it's time to accept your defeat.

1:17:01.630 --> 1:17:03.031
Like you did?

1:17:04.633 --> 1:17:08.304
You stalked across a
century, maybe even more,

1:17:08.337 --> 1:17:10.272
looking for your love lost,

1:17:10.305 --> 1:17:13.542
killing every woman
that resembles her

1:17:13.575 --> 1:17:16.111
only to kidnap the woman
that I love

1:17:16.144 --> 1:17:19.548
in some deluded desire
that, what?

1:17:19.581 --> 1:17:23.452
She's the reincarnated
version of your fiancé?

1:17:23.485 --> 1:17:25.889
And you have the audacity
to tell me

1:17:25.922 --> 1:17:28.357
I don't know
when to give up?

1:17:28.390 --> 1:17:33.529
You dare speak to
me with such insolence!

1:17:33.562 --> 1:17:34.563
Jonathan!

1:17:34.596 --> 1:17:36.332
Your insistence on
interrupting

1:17:36.365 --> 1:17:38.534
when I'm speaking
to Miss Van Helsing

1:17:38.567 --> 1:17:41.437
has grown tiresome,
Jonathon Harker.

1:17:41.470 --> 1:17:44.340
I would urge that you
learn from your mistakes...

1:17:44.373 --> 1:17:46.175
if it weren't your last.

1:17:49.711 --> 1:17:52.481
What did you do to him?

1:18:01.056 --> 1:18:03.425
We have done that
already, remember?

1:18:09.831 --> 1:18:11.166
Stop!

1:18:11.199 --> 1:18:12.835
Mina, no!

1:18:12.868 --> 1:18:14.536
Mina...

1:18:16.271 --> 1:18:17.773
Let her go.

1:18:17.806 --> 1:18:23.112
Please, if you let her go,
I'll stay with you.

1:18:23.145 --> 1:18:26.281
You'll stay
with me, regardless.

1:18:27.917 --> 1:18:29.251
Maybe.

1:18:29.284 --> 1:18:33.489
But I'm telling you,
if you let her go,

1:18:33.522 --> 1:18:35.624
it would be
because I chose to.

1:18:35.657 --> 1:18:38.093
Me.

1:18:38.126 --> 1:18:40.964
And I know that there's a
part of you that wants that,

1:18:40.997 --> 1:18:42.664
to know that I chose you, too.

1:18:57.479 --> 1:19:01.350
I'm not interested
in bargains.

1:19:01.383 --> 1:19:05.320
You know very well that
I can make you choose me.

1:19:08.024 --> 1:19:09.291
I do.

1:19:10.893 --> 1:19:14.830
But I'm telling you
I'll do it willingly

1:19:16.531 --> 1:19:18.567
before you turn me
into what you are.

1:19:23.772 --> 1:19:25.741
And while I still have
a will of my own...

1:19:28.077 --> 1:19:29.678
I will stay with you.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:46.595
I'll be her.

1:19:49.966 --> 1:19:52.735
You are her!

1:19:52.768 --> 1:19:55.604
You are my wife!

1:20:02.277 --> 1:20:04.279
Actually...

1:20:06.049 --> 1:20:07.382
I'm her wife.

1:20:11.954 --> 1:20:13.355
Amelia!

1:20:13.388 --> 1:20:16.059
Amelia, how are you?
Baby?

1:20:16.092 --> 1:20:17.426
Are you okay?

1:20:17.459 --> 1:20:19.628
I'm supposed to be rescuing you.

1:20:25.734 --> 1:20:27.402
Fools!

1:20:29.871 --> 1:20:32.541
I will kill you both...

1:20:59.501 --> 1:21:02.738
Jonathan? Jonathan?

1:21:02.771 --> 1:21:03.872
Are you okay?

1:21:06.241 --> 1:21:08.810
Well, I'm alive.

1:21:17.419 --> 1:21:18.955
Let's go home.

1:21:41.177 --> 1:21:43.079
Can we just stop a second?

1:21:43.112 --> 1:21:44.613
Are you okay?

1:21:44.646 --> 1:21:45.814
Yeah.

1:21:45.847 --> 1:21:48.250
Well, no, actually,
no, not at all.

1:21:48.283 --> 1:21:50.552
I just wanna see it.

1:21:54.623 --> 1:21:57.026
Do you really think
he thought I was her?

1:21:57.059 --> 1:21:58.627
I think he hoped so.

1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:01.430
Love makes us hope
for impossible things.

1:22:01.463 --> 1:22:02.731
Well, he was an
impossible thing.

1:22:02.764 --> 1:22:04.599
Makes sense
he'd believe in another.

1:22:06.535 --> 1:22:07.971
So it's over?

1:22:08.004 --> 1:22:10.940
You saw him burn into
dust just like I did.

1:22:10.973 --> 1:22:12.608
Well, there are
certain blood rituals

1:22:12.641 --> 1:22:14.543
one could use to resurrect...

1:22:14.576 --> 1:22:17.512
Not today, Jonathan,
not today.

1:22:45.407 --> 1:22:48.111
Do you think Jonathan
will be okay?

1:22:48.144 --> 1:22:50.512
Thee doctor's said they need
to keep him for a few days.

1:22:50.545 --> 1:22:53.016
I think it'll be slow-going.

1:22:53.049 --> 1:22:56.785
But if I know Jonathan Harker,
he'll bounce back.

1:22:58.787 --> 1:23:00.322
I hope so.

1:23:00.355 --> 1:23:02.091
He will.

1:23:02.124 --> 1:23:05.027
He just needs time, and rest.

1:23:06.361 --> 1:23:07.930
We all do.

1:23:09.664 --> 1:23:11.399
Speaking of, when are
you coming to bed?

1:23:13.069 --> 1:23:14.403
I'll be there soon.

1:23:14.436 --> 1:23:15.537
Good.
