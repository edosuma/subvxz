surprised to get your message.

ROSLIN: The President
was surprised I sent it.

Once our chief negotiator
got a billy-club to the head,

02:22.392 --> 02:26.062

written us off as a lost cause.

least speak with the strikers

before sending in
the troops.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.623
They're teachers
not terrorists.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.083
They're acting like thugs.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.627
Their last demonstration put
two policemen in the hospital.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.254
Six of them have chained themselves
outside the Hall of Education.

they're criminals.

momentum for months and you know that.

things about being president

to discuss the Cylon.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.560
Dr. Cottle, would you...

07:58.311 --> 08:01.063
Would you please tell them
what you told me this morning?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.818
I'm no expert in genetics,
but I can read a blood test.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.570
That Cylon fetus

08:07.654 --> 08:11.574
is showing some very peculiar
genetic abnormalities.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.160
I haven't seen any of this
on your report, Doctor.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.454
No, well,
as Dr. Cottle says,

08:17.539 --> 08:19.665
he's not an expert and I am.

08:19.916 --> 08:24.753
I've been through the tests and I wouldn't
say that there was anything conclusive.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.882
I didn't say conclusive,
just damned odd.

08:28.592 --> 08:29.758
Right.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.303
BALTAR: Madam President?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.349
As you know,
the Sharon Cylon

08:37.434 --> 08:40.269
is of considerable tactical
value to the fleet and...

08:40.353 --> 08:43.939
Perhaps you've gotten too
close to your subject, Doctor.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.445
This is difficult,
so I'm gonna cut right to it.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.450
Allowing this thing to be born
could have frightening consequences.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.369
For the security
of this fleet,

08:57.454 --> 09:00.831

I'd like...

09:04.544 --> 09:08.297
I thought you of all people
would understand, Admiral.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.050
BALTAR: Madam President,

09:11.134 --> 09:13.636
I don't understand.
This makes no sense.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.722
One of the interesting things
about being president

09:16.806 --> 09:19.266
is you don't have to
explain yourself to anyone.

09:19.351 --> 09:22.269
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'm a little tired.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.773
Gentlemen?

09:28.109 --> 09:31.403
I don't want to seem alarmist,
but I am perturbed.

09:31.488 --> 09:35.157
I think that the President's
illness is affecting her judgment.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.825
Especially when it
comes to the subject of...

09:36.910 --> 09:38.744
ADAMA: She seemed
reasonably coherent to me.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.955
Well, then I'll have to appeal
to you on scientific grounds.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.206
Destroying this child

09:42.290 --> 09:45.084
would seriously impact my
studies of the Cylon subspecies.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.877
The President made the call.
I'm backing her.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.505
With all due respect, the President
made the call based on evidence

09:49.589 --> 09:50.923
presented by Dr. Cottle
and he...

09:51.007 --> 09:52.591
Pull yourself together.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.719
You're about to become
President of the Colonies.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.389
You're gonna be asked to
make some very hard decisions.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.432
Act like you can handle it.

mightily in my absence.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.285

Oh, yeah? Concerned?
About what?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.331
Our child!

11:05.749 --> 11:07.082
You're concerned?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.418
Well, for your information, the
President intends to kill it!

11:09.502 --> 11:12.338
Once Roslin's gone,
you'll be President.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.840
You can use your new authority
to save our child.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.509
Yeah, yeah. That's good. Did you
see the way Adama looked at me?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.303
The contempt on his face?

11:19.387 --> 11:21.388
I will be the President,
all right,

11:21.598 --> 11:25.225
but without military support I might
as well be an anointed dogcatcher.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.771
Yes, well, you have your own

There is one way.

have to ask...

11:42.035 --> 11:43.744
I didn't wanna have
to ask you for this.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.870
NO. 6: But what
I really need...

11:44.954 --> 11:46.580
But what I really need
to complete the project...

11:46.664 --> 11:48.707
Is a nuclear warhead.
Is a nuclear

11:49.876 --> 11:51.126
warhead.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.762
If Adama remains committed to
the destruction of our child,

12:01.930 --> 12:03.847
it may be
our only hope.

There's no easy way
to say this.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.538
Why?

12:27.664 --> 12:30.666
Doc Cottle
discovered some anomalies

12:31.167 --> 12:32.960
in the fetal blood work.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.629
Isn't that expected?

12:35.922 --> 12:36.922
Maybe.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.591
But the President
believes

12:39.676 --> 12:41.885
that to allow the baby
to come to full term,

12:41.970 --> 12:45.431
it constitutes an
unacceptable risk to the fleet.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.516
I don't understand.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.770
Sharon's only helped us since
she came back from Caprica.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.272
She even turned on her own.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.815
To save her life.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.192
Don't mistake
the will to live

12:58.319 --> 13:00.571
for genuine compassion,
Lieutenant.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.615
She's still the enemy.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.076
Does she know?

13:06.703 --> 13:07.870
Not yet.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.999
Then I should be the one
to tell her.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.960
If that's all, sir.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.086
Helo.

13:16.171 --> 13:19.673
I don't expect you
to agree to the decision,

13:20.091 --> 13:22.301
but I need you
to accept it.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.262
We're talking about
my child, sir.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.848
Part of me.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.934
But I guess it's easier to
kill when you call it a Cylon.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.020
Dismissed.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.489
So you're saying someone's been
tampering with our ammunition?

both Galactica and Pegasus
fighters to stand down?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.747
The price you pay for
reinstating me as CAG, sir.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.165
Maybe that was a mistake.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.833
Maybe I don't give a damn
what you think, sir.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.627
Take it easy,
both of you.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.464
The fact is we've been sharing
stores between the ships.

And nobody flies combat until
our ammo supplies check out.

Cylons decide to pick a fight.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.057

We just didn't know about it.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.674
...but I'm one of many!

14:44.634 --> 14:47.386
We have declared war against
Galactica's army of death!

14:47.470 --> 14:48.470
MAN: Let's go.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.430
The Cylons
aren't our true enemy,

14:50.515 --> 14:53.433
it's the military
that refuses to negotiate!

14:54.143 --> 14:56.228
ASHA: All we want is peace!

14:56.312 --> 14:58.772
Demand peace!
Demand peace!

14:58.856 --> 15:01.149
So much for being discreet,
huh?

15:07.407 --> 15:12.327
ADAMA: We found these
pamphlets in Janik's quarters.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.832
Some kind of a manifesto.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.044
"Demand peace" from the Cylons?
Who the hell are these people?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.504
Cylon sympathizers.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.049
I just had no idea
they were this organized.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.177
I want to know
how she got aboard my ship.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.096
The hangar deck's
short-staffed.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.141
We've been forced to import civilians
to handle some of the grunt work.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.726
Apparently she's...

15:35.810 --> 15:37.561
She's a Picon, worked
maintenance on the Greenleaf,

15:37.645 --> 15:39.104
no known criminal
affiliations.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.106
Until now.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.441
Now listen to this,

15:42.525 --> 15:46.111
"Do not be afraid. We are not
terrorists, but we will not sit back

15:46.195 --> 15:48.947
"while Adama's war machine
continues to press us

15:49.032 --> 15:51.116
"into cruel
and futile conflict. "

15:51.200 --> 15:52.534
Gods damn it.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.161
Well, her demonstration's
worked.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.538
The news is already spreading
across the fleet.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.789
I know.

15:58.374 --> 16:02.753
We were contacted by a person
claiming to speak for the subversives,

16:02.837 --> 16:05.464
demanding a meeting
on the Galactica.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.966
Well, they've got stones,
I'll give them that.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.551
ADAMA: Well, I've agreed.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.761
What?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.888
We're not negotiating.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.183
I just wanna know
what we're up against.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.565
(GASPING)

16:27.570 --> 16:28.737
(MOANING)

16:29.238 --> 16:30.947
(DISTORTED TALKING)

16:32.075 --> 16:35.786
STANS: Considering the stakes, you
don't seem particularly engaged.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.539
The stakes are what we decide
to make them, Mr. Stans.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.793
If the President uses troops to
enforce his back-to-work order,

16:42.877 --> 16:44.294
people will get hurt.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.587
Even die.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.507
Some causes
are worth dying for.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.220
Not this one.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.769
(GASPING)

17:01.437 --> 17:03.313
DOCTOR: The mass is malignant.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.606
Doctor...

17:07.110 --> 17:08.443
(GASPING)

17:12.824 --> 17:13.865
Admiral.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.617
I am Royan Jahee.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.162
You have a unique way of
welcoming visitors to your ship.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.539
TIGH: Visitor my ass.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.290
We shoot people like you
for treason.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.000
Colonel, I'm only
an interested party,

17:24.085 --> 17:25.961
trying to prevent
more bloodshed.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.047
I deplore what happened
aboard your Vipers.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.008
How many sympathizers do
we have aboard this fleet?

17:32.969 --> 17:36.722
If you're trying to crush an
organization, you can stop now.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.642
The people in this movement are
following an idea, not a leader.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.310
What the hell do they want?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.229
Peace with the Cylon.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.523
You want us to surrender.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.985
They attacked us.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.195
Only after
we'd enslaved them!

17:52.822 --> 17:55.699
You call yourselves
military men, strategists!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.869
Explain to me how our current
course of attack and retreat

17:58.953 --> 18:00.162
leads to victory!

18:00.329 --> 18:01.788
You can play
innocent bystander,

18:01.873 --> 18:03.457
but I think you know more
than you're telling us.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.876
Either way,
you're a danger to this fleet.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.712
Admiral, arresting me isn't
going to stop any of this.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.881
Maybe not,
but it's a start.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.174
Take him away.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.681
All right,
get your rubber gloves on.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.601
This is everything from
the Janik woman's quarters.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.020
Somehow the Admiral thinks
looking through this crap

18:25.104 --> 18:28.732
is gonna tell us something new
about their so-called movement.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.070
So, um,

18:35.323 --> 18:38.533
I haven't seen much of you
since your spacewalk.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.203
APOLLO: Hold it.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.621
What's this?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.877
What's a deckhand need with
a portable library reader?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.507
The Daru Mozu.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.884
A Tylium refinery.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.345
And Janik's
used to explosives.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.768
This is the CAG. Get me a
TAC team ready. Right now.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.353
BOOMER: (ON TELEPHONE)
I don't understand.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.605
Why are they doing this now?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.068
I don't know.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.697
The Admiral said they found
something in the baby's blood.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.828
Somehow President Roslin
considers it a threat to the fleet.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.913
It can't just be that.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.083
I've done nothing but help
them since I've come here.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.918
I've held back my anger.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.462
I've tried to show them that
Cylons are not all the same.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.839
That we're not all murderers.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.591
Deep down, I think they're
still afraid of you.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.844
Yeah.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.471
Afraid.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.862
They wanna be afraid
of something?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.865
Yeah? Just let them come.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.783
Let them!

20:01.868 --> 20:04.369
Let them just try
to take my baby!

20:05.079 --> 20:06.496
(GRUNTING)

20:07.623 --> 20:09.708
Let them try to take my baby.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.959
Sharon, stop!

20:11.043 --> 20:12.043
(SCREAMING)

20:15.089 --> 20:17.924
Sharon, please, don't do this.
Please!

20:18.676 --> 20:20.093
(YELLING)

20:20.553 --> 20:22.596
HELO: Listen to me.
Listen to me.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.598
Listen to me.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.187
HELO: Sharon, look at me.

20:31.314 --> 20:33.481
GUARD: Let's go.
Hey! Easy!

20:33.566 --> 20:34.566
Easy!

20:42.408 --> 20:44.618
When we land, move fast.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.913
We're looking for explosive devices
set near the Daru's FTL drive.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.623
Captain, I'm getting something
on the wireless.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.625
I think it's coming
from the Daru Mozu.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.005
WOMAN: (ON RADIO) None of us wants
to die, but the fighting must end.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.592
If my sacrifice sends a signal
to the Cylon that brings peace,

21:00.676 --> 21:01.760
then it was worth it.

21:01.844 --> 21:05.931
I do this for my children and for the
children that will follow them, gods willing.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.432
Demand peace.
Pull out!

21:07.516 --> 21:08.850
Demand peace.
Pull out! Pull out!

21:08.935 --> 21:10.477
Pull out! Pull out!

21:11.729 --> 21:13.438
(MACHINE BEEPING)

21:27.036 --> 21:28.286
People are dead.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.288
I grieve for them, Admiral.

21:30.373 --> 21:34.292
And I assure you the Tylium ship's
just a taste of what's in store

21:34.377 --> 21:37.128
unless someone
starts listening!

21:37.213 --> 21:38.630
(GROANING)

21:38.798 --> 21:41.716
You listen,
and you listen well.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.593
I don't care
if I have to interrogate

21:43.678 --> 21:45.929
every civilian
onboard this fleet.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.973
This is gonna stop.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.642
Do you understand?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.060
(GROANING) Yes.

21:58.401 --> 22:02.612
BILLY: Mr. Vice President, President
Roslin insisted on your taking the tour.

22:02.697 --> 22:06.241
She'd like the transition to
go as smoothly as possible.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.870
BALTAR: What are these?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.914
Cylon agent suspects, sir.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.011
That number
means everything to her.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.096
It represents hope.
It's our future.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.977
Yes. Yes.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.187
Being the President is

22:37.398 --> 22:39.065
a lot of responsibility.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.692
It's tradition
for outgoing Presidents

22:40.776 --> 22:42.819
to leave a letter
for their successor.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.531
It's usually opened on the
first day of the new term.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.284
But the next few days
are likely to prove

22:50.786 --> 22:52.454
hectic, so...

22:58.961 --> 23:01.379
Well, let's just pray
that she gets better.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.589
Let's.

Yes.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.906

24:01.023 --> 24:04.109
I was told I might meet
an old friend here.

GINA: It's good to see you,
Gaius.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.411
So you've become a member
of the peace movement?

24:15.496 --> 24:17.664
Well, despite
what you may think,

24:17.748 --> 24:19.374
I've always abhorred violence.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.878
Would you excuse us, please?

24:31.095 --> 24:33.471
Do they have any idea
what you are?

24:33.556 --> 24:36.599
Of course not. Even their
dedication has limits.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.815
I've missed you.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.239
You look amazing.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.705
I can't believe

25:05.087 --> 25:06.713
how real you are.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.676
What are you doing?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.136
I haven't stopped
thinking about you

25:13.220 --> 25:15.305
since the second
I left the Pegasus.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.600
No. I can't get you out of my head.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.352
Don't do this now. Not
yet. I can't help myself.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.812
I can't.
Gaius.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.606
(GRUNTING)

25:31.155 --> 25:32.280
I'm sorry.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.240
No.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.952
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm not ready.

25:38.829 --> 25:42.040
So is there any reason in particular
for inviting me around here?

25:42.124 --> 25:43.708
Because you saved me.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.212
Let me save you.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.005
Here we go again.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.051
What are you talking about?

25:53.135 --> 25:54.636
You must sense it.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.429
Gaius, the fleet's crumbling.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.722
People are turning
on each other.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.350
There are serious misgivings
about the military.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.269
When you're President,

26:03.520 --> 26:05.939
you can use the office
to turn them against Adama,

26:06.023 --> 26:08.483
paving the way
for the Cylons to save us.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.944
I would love to be with you
always, but...

26:11.028 --> 26:13.738
I know it's hard,
but it's the only way.

26:27.878 --> 26:28.878
No.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.756
No.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.094
I am not who you think I am,

26:36.595 --> 26:40.348
and I will not be responsible
for the destruction of mankind.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.732
If we would have caught it sooner,
maybe we could have done more.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.028
ADAR: Laura.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.202
I didn't like the way
we left things this morning.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.496
Richard...
I know.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.208
You've been thinking this
is a mistake for a while now.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.561
I just met with Stans.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.689
The Education Alliance
is going to back off.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.274
Back off?

27:33.235 --> 27:35.153
Laura, what did you give them?

27:36.947 --> 27:38.281
I made them a promise

27:38.365 --> 27:41.409
that we would seriously hear
out their grievances, Richard.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.413
I thought you'd be happy
they're going back to work.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.248
Laura,

27:47.708 --> 27:50.001
you've put me
in a very awkward position.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.711
I don't see how.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.005
Both sides gave ground.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.840
It's not just
about your teachers.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.176
It's the next strike
I'm worried about.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.595
You just showed them that
if they hold out long enough,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.597
this administration will cave.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.391
You expected me to fail.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.769
I expected you
to hold the line.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.314
This doesn't have to be
the end of the world.

28:11.398 --> 28:15.610
You can stay on in an advisory
capacity. Gods know we need your ideas.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.945
You're asking me to resign?

28:18.447 --> 28:20.406
I don't have any choice.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.867
This isn't about
you and me anymore.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.494
You're right, it's not.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.537
You were willing
to attack those people,

28:26.622 --> 28:29.165
and up until a few hours ago,
I was prepared to let you.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.252
I am on my way to the Galactica
to represent this administration.

28:33.629 --> 28:36.547
When I return, if you still want
my job, be prepared to fight.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.551
When I return, if you still want
my job, be prepared to fight.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.013
Notify the Admiral.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.182
(FLATLINING)

28:46.266 --> 28:48.142
This is Admiral Adama.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.561
As you know, President Roslin

28:50.646 --> 28:52.563
has been aboard Galactica

28:52.648 --> 28:54.273
for the last few days.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.733
She's a fighter.

28:55.818 --> 28:59.654
But as of this moment,
her prognosis is grave.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.242
I know that many of you
believe in the power of prayer.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.869
If that is your way,
then I urge you

29:08.414 --> 29:10.456
to pray for our President.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.709
As for the others,
I hope you will join me

29:15.003 --> 29:17.213
in keeping her
in our thoughts.

30:15.731 --> 30:19.192
Admiral, please don't do this.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.574
Stand down, everyone.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.245
Give me room.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.381
Think about what you're doing,
Helo.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.592
You're a soldier.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.886
I'm a father, like you.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.931
Please, sir,

30:50.557 --> 30:52.517
give me a Raptor.
Let me take her off the ship.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.769
I'll get her away
from the fleet.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.895
I can't do that, son.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.147
BALTAR: Admiral! Admiral!
Admiral!

30:58.398 --> 31:00.650
Doctor, get the hell
out of here!

31:01.068 --> 31:03.444
I must talk to you
concerning the Cylon child.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.571
It seems I may have been

31:06.907 --> 31:07.907
wrong,

31:08.825 --> 31:10.201
very wrong,

31:11.245 --> 31:14.914
when I said that Dr. Cottle
misinterpreted the fetal blood work.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.218
BALTAR: You see, I had
another look at those samples

31:27.302 --> 31:30.304
and I discovered something
quite intriguing.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.892
Understand, Cylon blood is virtually
impossible to differentiate from our own.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.228
That being said, obviously it
has to be slightly different

31:37.312 --> 31:39.146
because the Cylon
is not human.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.319
If our blood

31:46.029 --> 31:48.823
looks like this,

31:49.825 --> 31:51.075
for example,

31:52.202 --> 31:56.205
and the Cylon's blood
looks like this,

32:00.377 --> 32:04.797
then it's fair to assume that the
Cylon-human is carrying an amalgam.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.758
Is this a theory or fact?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.845
The Cylon's fetus
contains no antigens,

32:10.929 --> 32:12.263
it has no blood type.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.141
That's what Dr. Cottle was talking
about when he said it was damned odd.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.560
Except it's not damned odd,
it's astonishing.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.687
Now, knowing, as we do,

32:19.771 --> 32:22.982
that the Cylons are built slightly better
to endure than their human counterparts,

32:23.066 --> 32:27.153
I wondered, could the Cylon blood
also be blessed, shall we say blessed,

32:27.362 --> 32:30.031
with a heightened resistance
to disease?

32:32.492 --> 32:33.492
So

32:34.077 --> 32:37.038
I applied a sample

32:37.247 --> 32:39.206
of Sharon's fetal blood

32:39.833 --> 32:42.877
to some cancer cells
I took from the President.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.804
What am I looking at?

32:53.889 --> 32:55.056
Nothing.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.682
That's the whole point.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.727
The cancer was gone and it was
gone within a matter of hours.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.647
Are you saying you've found a
cure for the President's cancer?

33:02.731 --> 33:04.231
Well, it's untried.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.694
It's obviously untried and
therefore extremely dangerous.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.029
But, yes,

33:10.906 --> 33:12.198
it's possible.

33:12.282 --> 33:15.660
If you abort Sharon's fetus
now, you'll never know.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.597
Now, you may feel
a sharp pain.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.852
Sharon, it's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.420
I don't like
what you're doing.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.423
I think it's unnatural
and damned dangerous.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.050
Yes, well,

34:13.468 --> 34:15.511
given the patient's
current condition,

34:15.595 --> 34:18.222
I am not sure
that I see the downside.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.641
Maybe it's just her time.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.312
Then for once

34:26.231 --> 34:29.066
perhaps I am the beacon
of hope around here.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.530
It's all right.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.407
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.242
I'm right here with you,
Sharon.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.249
If you wanna settle this,
your people have to disengage.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.919
No more civil disobedience,
no more acts of violence.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.673
I want our students
back in school.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.012

works with Roslin from within,

this case as proof of his sincerity.

be the one to open it.
