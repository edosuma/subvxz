It's very hard to find the store

00:01.460 --> 00:04.254
that you want in a mall.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.715
They have the directory,

00:04.254 --> 00:06.715
but the problem with it is

00:06.715 --> 00:08.676
even if you figure out

00:06.715 --> 00:08.676
where you are

00:08.676 --> 00:10.845

00:10.845 --> 00:14.139

00:10.845 --> 00:14.139
sometimes, which way to walk,

00:14.139 --> 00:16.266
because it's an upright map.

If you had, like,

then you could, thp,

00:17.977 --> 00:19.728
walk on it.

Then you could tell.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.815
You could just be on it, going,

00:22.815 --> 00:24.566
"All right, I'm here.

They would see you

00:32.491 --> 00:34.576

00:34.576 --> 00:36.495

05:22.114 --> 05:24.866
they're gonna put me on

05:22.114 --> 05:24.866
an aggravation installment plan

05:24.866 --> 05:27.244
that will compound with interest

05:24.866 --> 05:27.244
for decades.

Parents never forget

05:27.244 --> 05:28.870
a foul-up.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.832
I once left my jacket

05:28.870 --> 05:31.832
on a bus when I was 14.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.793
I was flying to Chicago

05:31.832 --> 05:34.793

05:34.793 --> 05:36.670

05:36.670 --> 05:38.880
There's no way you can

05:36.670 --> 05:38.880

05:38.880 --> 05:40.548
I'll call them

05:38.880 --> 05:40.548
on their car phone.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.134
What do you think

05:40.548 --> 05:42.134
it would take

05:42.134 --> 05:43.885
for his parents

05:42.134 --> 05:43.885
to get a car phone?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.053
Hypnosis by aliens.

Where the hell

05:45.053 --> 05:46.763
is this car, Kramer?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.056
We need

05:46.763 --> 05:48.056

Well, it's gotta

05:48.056 --> 05:49.474

05:49.474 --> 05:52.019

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854

Maybe it's not

05:54.896 --> 05:56.481
on this level.

There's four

06:00.027 --> 06:01.528
different levels.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.488
Maybe we're on

06:01.528 --> 06:03.488
the wrong level.

How long was

06:03.488 --> 06:05.282

06:05.282 --> 06:06.992

06:06.992 --> 06:09.203
a pad and a pen.

with urologists

06:22.090 --> 06:24.383

since I was 11 years old.

the best thing to do
