an hour ago.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.942
Honey,
couscous is not a meal.

00:09.944 --> 00:12.244
It's an appetizer
with ambition.

You always make me laugh.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.792
What do you want,
woman?

00:28.062 --> 00:31.030
I had this idea
for our summer vacation.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.998
Well, if it's about
going camping in Wyoming,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.335
that's my idea, but you can
take credit for it. Okay.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.404
I-I know you're gonna groan
when I say this,

00:38.406 --> 00:40.572
but I was thinking we could
finally go to Paris.

You are so funny.

to go there for years.

for years.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.420
We're on a roll here, hon.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.587
No, no, no. Think about it.
Think about it.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.356
Paris in June,

00:57.358 --> 00:59.091
and I've been
learning French,

00:59.093 --> 01:01.193

"You'll have to excuse him.

He's American."

Oh, honey, I wish I could say
that feeling went away.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.567

-Mm-hmm.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.069
Kyle and I are having
our first real fight.

but with no music
to tell me how to feel.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.775
That<i> does</i> sound
like a reality TV show.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.177
That's why I'm totally
uninterested.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.279
What, uh, what was
the fight about, sweetie?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.847
The wedding.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.549
I told him I really wanted
to get married in our church,

to get married in his.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.084
He won't give in.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.420
No, Mandy,
you have to convince him.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.755
Kristin got married
in our church.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.089
It's a --
It's a tradition.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.058
The Baxter girls all have
their wedding there.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.661
How could it be a tradition
if just Kris got married there?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.930
We got married there.

01:37.932 --> 01:38.931
Oh, yeah.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.102
Okay, well,
one of you has to convince him

01:43.104 --> 01:44.754
because I already
tried my best.

01:44.755 --> 01:46.405
I texted him a sad face,
a church,

01:46.407 --> 01:47.723
a hot-air balloon,
and a cactus,

01:47.724 --> 01:49.040
and all I got back
was a question mark, so...

01:52.246 --> 01:54.546
You, uh,
you need to talk to Kyle.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.714
Why me?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.299
Well, because
he'll listen to you.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.883
He'll listen to anybody.

Exactly.

Well, I have to pick
this one

because I really want
to get married in my church.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.520
Why?

03:08.522 --> 03:09.955
Your church used to be
a roller rink.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.891
Six days a week,
it still is.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.460
It's just
your new pastor

03:15.462 --> 03:19.064
wants everybody to attend
premarital counseling.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.065
What if he doesn't think
we should get married?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.167
I wouldn't worry
about that.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.702

the new pastor personally,

I don't really know anything
about being a husband.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.851
You know, my dad wasn't around
when I was growing up,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.887
so I never had
a role model.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.922
You know, on the farm,

03:43.924 --> 03:46.091
we had a hog
who really loved his sow,

03:46.093 --> 03:47.359

Reverend Paul

03:47.361 --> 03:48.760

Gumball is enough?

Sounds interesting.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.732
What are we talking
about here?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.168
Well, Kyle's a little worried
that the pastor at my church

03:56.170 --> 03:57.786
won't think he has
anyone in his life

03:57.787 --> 03:59.403
to teach him
how to be a good husband,

03:59.406 --> 04:02.641
and his best candidate
is a pig.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.245
Well, pigs are
intelligent beasts,

04:06.247 --> 04:08.981
which is probably why
they do not mate for life.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.149
You can cross Ed
off your list.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.187

08:14.595 --> 08:17.095
Or, as Reverend Paul put it,
"deeply disturbing."

08:17.097 --> 08:18.997
So he needs to meet
with you guys tomorrow

08:18.999 --> 08:20.098
before he meets with us again.
Hmm.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.468
-Come on, Kyle.
-Unbelievable.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.303
Unbelievable.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.137
They may not be able
to get married in our church

08:27.140 --> 08:28.773
because of you.
(sighs)

08:28.775 --> 08:30.342
You know how much
I wanted that.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.727
Exactly, which is why

08:31.728 --> 08:33.111
that's what
we should focus on,

08:33.113 --> 08:34.613
not who said what
to Kyle

08:34.615 --> 08:35.947
or who said they win
all the arguments.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.115
Yeah, both you.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.517
Okay, bottom line --

08:38.519 --> 08:39.985
we put up a united front

08:39.987 --> 08:41.953
to show the new reverend
that we have a perfect marriage.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.955
That is so funny!
(stomps foot)

08:43.957 --> 08:46.625
Yeah.
(giggles)

08:46.627 --> 08:46.992
You always
make me laugh.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.093
Yeah.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.898
♪♪

08:52.900 --> 08:54.232
Okay.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.568
Now we both have
our own podiums.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.903
Kris, we're ready.
(air hisses)

08:57.905 --> 08:59.638
It's kind of a crappy
debate stage.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.039
What is this, MSNBC?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.508
No, no.
Can't make those jokes.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.710
I am the conservative, and
you're the liberal, remember?

09:05.712 --> 09:06.711
Right.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.647
Rachel Maddow is my hero.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.582
(inhales sharply)
God, that leaves a taste.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.817
Okay,
here are the rules.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.819
You each have 30 seconds
for a response.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.321
When you hear this...

09:16.323 --> 09:17.722
your time is up.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.157
If you continue talking,
you will hear...

09:19.159 --> 09:20.926
(horn honks)

09:20.928 --> 09:23.828
And if you still won't shut up,
I am out of here.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.431
I'm not Megyn Kelly,
and I've got packing to do.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.032
Let's begin with a brief
opening statement.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.034
Ryan.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.903
America
is at a crossroads.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.905
Do we go the way
of Ronald Reagan,

09:33.906 --> 09:35.906
the greatest man with the
greatest hair who ever lived?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.243
Or do we follow
the lead

09:38.245 --> 09:40.278
of my weak-kneed,
socialist opponent

09:40.280 --> 09:42.614
who longs for the day
when ISIS rules the world

09:42.616 --> 09:44.082
and Americans
are in chains?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.917
What?
That's crazy.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.286
Nobody would say that.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.455
Conservatives say that stuff
all the time.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.823
We're lunatics.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.190
Are you gonna
take this seriously or not?

09:53.193 --> 09:53.992
Because I'd like
to get a good grade on this.

09:55.529 --> 09:56.695
Hey! I didn't even
get a chance to respond!

09:56.697 --> 09:58.296
(horn honks)
Oh, my God.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.865
Sorry.
You wasted your time.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.433
Okay, next topic --
entitlements.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.435
Uh, I'd like to go first on that one.
Mm-kay.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.036
Democrats have created
a nation of takers

10:05.038 --> 10:07.639
who live like kings

10:07.641 --> 10:09.274
and who have never done
a lick of work in their lives.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.276
My opponent may disagree
with this,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.544
but the best thing
we can do

10:12.546 --> 10:13.912
for the poor, elderly,
and disabled

10:13.914 --> 10:16.615
is to let them rot.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.517
Uh, thank you.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.418
Of course I disagree
with that.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.153
<i> Everybody</i> disagrees
with that.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.055
You know what? This whole
thing is stupid. Okay?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.890
You're just an angry,
malnourished vegan

10:25.892 --> 10:27.892
that is jealous
that I can eat cheeseburgers.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.562
So I quit.
This is stupid.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.596
I'm leaving.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.098
Oh, yeah.

10:33.100 --> 10:33.999
And Rachel Maddow sucks.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.772
Man, it is real easy
being a conservative.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.940
What is the matter
with you?

10:41.942 --> 10:43.942
That was my little sister,
and she needed your help.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.244
Trust me.
This is going to help.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.612
What? You see, I
have a theory --

10:47.614 --> 10:48.847

10:48.849 --> 10:50.915
♪♪

10:52.019 --> 10:54.919
Okay.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.854
Reverend Paul
will be right in.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.256
-Ah. (chuckles)
-Thanks a lot.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.759
Hey, look at this.
Churches of Europe. Ugh.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.794
Maybe we should
borrow this

11:02.796 --> 11:05.630
to get a preview of what
we<i> will</i> be seeing this summer.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.633
Yeah, that's how
I want to spend my vacation --

11:08.635 --> 11:09.801
going to church.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.935
I hear ya.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.904
(chuckles)

11:16.309 --> 11:19.177
That'd be a little too much
like going to work.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.612
(both chuckle)
Hey, Reverend Paul.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.180
Really nice
to meet you two finally.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.948
Mike Baxter. You've probably
seen my name in the bibles

11:23.950 --> 11:26.117
right there by the words
"donated by."

11:26.119 --> 11:27.519
(all chuckle)

11:27.521 --> 11:28.787
You know,
for 50 bucks more,

11:28.789 --> 11:30.522
we can give you
a "written by."

11:30.524 --> 11:31.523
(both chuckle)

11:31.525 --> 11:32.957
-Uh, I'm Vanessa.
-Hi.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.693
We are so thrilled to have you
as our new pastor...

11:34.695 --> 11:36.194
Thank you.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.196
...and -- and I'm really
loving the contemporary service.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.197
Yeah. Yes, I've always
thought "How Great Thou Art"

11:40.200 --> 11:41.199
needed a guitar solo.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.333
(laughs)

11:42.335 --> 11:43.902
Well, please,
sit, sit, sit.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.337
You know,
we're also very excited

11:46.339 --> 11:48.173
about Mandy
and Kyle's wedding.

11:48.175 --> 11:52.210
Hopefully happening here
in our longtime family church.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.713
In pews we also donated.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.083
Well, Mandy and Kyle
are a lovely, young couple.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.418
Yeah, we think so, too.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.353
Well, looks like
we covered everything.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.922
We'll see you
at the rehearsal dinner.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.024
Um, why don't you have a seat
on that sofa

12:06.026 --> 12:08.159
that you may or may not
have donated?

12:12.499 --> 12:16.768
If your marriage is the model
for Mandy and Kyle,

12:16.770 --> 12:19.003
well, I have a few questions.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.005
Oh, we have a rock-solid relationship.
Mm-hmm.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.024
I mean,
we're gonna be the old couple

12:23.025 --> 12:25.042
who dies within minutes of
each other at the old-age home,

12:25.045 --> 12:26.044
face-down in our pudding.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.513
(laughs)

12:28.515 --> 12:31.349
Both chocolate!
Chocolate.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.984
Yeah,
that's how my parents went.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.593
Kyle mentioned
a vacation argument...

12:41.595 --> 12:42.927
Oh. ...and apparently you
don't want to go camping?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.697
Uh, well, no.
No.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.099
I mean, I would much rather
go to Paris and sit in cafés,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.401
drinking
amazing bottles of...

12:50.403 --> 12:51.503
coffee.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.205
We have disagreements...
Yeah.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.573
...but at the end
of the day,

12:55.574 --> 12:56.940
there's a balanced,
spirited give and take.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.277
I see.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.212
So might this be one
of those times when --

13:01.214 --> 13:03.081
how did Kyle put it? --
uh, you let her win?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.582
Listen.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.418
I don't want to say
anything bad about Kyle,

13:07.420 --> 13:10.155
so let's go
to the next question.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.374
(chuckles)
Well, hey.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.592
Don't be judgmental.
That's my job.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.428
Vanessa, do you ever feel

13:17.430 --> 13:19.931
that sometimes Mike can be
a little bit of a bully?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.733
(scoffs)
Wha--

13:21.735 --> 13:23.268
This woman buys $40 candles,
and<i> I'm</i> the bully?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.836
(scoffs)

13:24.838 --> 13:25.770
Please feel free to speak
if you want to say something.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.106
Well, I --
No, I mean, I --

13:28.108 --> 13:28.907
Honey, honey, why don't
we talk about this later

13:28.909 --> 13:31.676
at our favorite restaurant,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.845
the United Front?

13:33.847 --> 13:36.447
I'm starting to see
what Kyle meant

13:36.449 --> 13:38.917
about the pig
who wears the pants.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.119
No, no, no, no, no.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.689
That's an actual pig
in real pants.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.043
-Is it?
-Okay.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.928
All right, all right.
You know what?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.030
Look -- Look, I can clear
this whole thing up.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.099
My husband
is complicated.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.769
He's -- he's stubborn,
he's pushy,

13:57.771 --> 14:00.438
he has, like,
zero patience, and --

14:00.440 --> 14:02.574
Good job, honey.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.945
The man I married
is not perfect.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.314
But you know what?
Neither am I.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.882
And you have been
at this church

14:10.883 --> 14:12.449
for -- for, what,
all of two weeks?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.519
Okay. How -- how can
you possibly know

14:14.521 --> 14:15.119
what goes on between us?
Honey.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.622
Because we fit.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.058
We work.
We're perfect.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.595
In our marriage,
both of the pigs wear the pants.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.283
And -- and I don't know

14:28.284 --> 14:30.368
if I want someone officiating
in my daughter's marriage

14:30.370 --> 14:31.870
who doesn't believe in mine.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.004
Oh, and you know what?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.507
Your guitar service
is lame.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.345
You, sir,
are no Dave Matthews.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.913
Well,
Dave Matthews isn't stuck

14:41.915 --> 14:43.982
with Mrs. Osgood
as his organist.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.185
(chuckles)

14:47.187 --> 14:49.654
Oh, wow.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.122
Now you see how I end up
with $40 candles.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.367
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.002
What's the world's
most perilous journey?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.937
Scaling Everest?

15:05.939 --> 15:08.072
Crossing the Himalayas?

15:08.074 --> 15:11.910
The drive home
after eating Indian food?

15:11.912 --> 15:15.613
Dad, is that you?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.348
Nah, the most dangerous
expedition

15:17.350 --> 15:19.083
is where
one half the people quit

15:19.085 --> 15:20.285
and the other half die.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.352
Hmm?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.721
Yeah, marriage.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.857
And all the survival gear
I sell you won't save you

15:25.859 --> 15:27.759
if you marry the wrong person.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.727
You pick the wrong partner,
you find yourself

15:29.729 --> 15:31.763
in an episode of
"Naked and Afraid,"

15:31.765 --> 15:34.565
only you'll rarely be naked.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.768
On the flip side,
you find your true life partner,

15:36.770 --> 15:39.237
and there's no mountain
or tundra you can't conquer.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.073
And you'll be naked
a lot more often.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.942
In Proverbs 21:9,
King Solomon wrote,

15:43.944 --> 15:46.611
"Better to live
on the corner of a roof

15:46.613 --> 15:47.946
than share the house
with a quarrelsome wife."

15:47.948 --> 15:52.250
And this dude knew wives.
He had 700 of them.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.152
That's a lot of anniversaries
to remember.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.388
God forbid you give Bathsheba
and Esther the same gift.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.992
(effeminate voice)
"Really? A straw hat?"

16:00.994 --> 16:02.927
(normal voice) And while
I appreciate the scripture,

16:02.929 --> 16:03.995
the truest thing
I ever read about marriage

16:03.997 --> 16:06.297
was on a coffee mug.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.833
It said,
"Happy Wife, Happy Life."

16:08.835 --> 16:12.103
Hasn't steered me wrong since
the day she threw it at me.

I left my binder, so...

16:42.669 --> 16:44.002
You also left your dignity.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.537
All right, fine.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.773

16:52.445 --> 16:54.178
how to have a rational
and civilized debate.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.613
Well, I don't know why.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.448
The crazy ones get
all the good ratings.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.385
Rational and civilized
aren't very popular these days,

17:00.387 --> 17:02.286
but it is still
worth learning.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.971
You know, you're pretty good
at this stuff.

17:03.972 --> 17:05.655
We're you ever on your
high school debate team?

17:05.658 --> 17:07.125
Nope.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.693
My training started
the very first time I said,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.528
"I don't think
I agree with you, Mike."

17:11.865 --> 17:12.964
Every argument,
he'd bait me, and I'd blow up.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.500
Yeah,
you used to get pretty mad.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.502
One time, soy milk
came out of your nose.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.237
And that's how I'd lose.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.073
But eventually,
I learned to keep my cool.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.041
And now you win some?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.075
Nope.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.910
But I keep my cool.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.413
All right, well,
if you're still cool with it,

17:28.415 --> 17:30.848
I'd love for you to coach me
on some liberal arguments

17:30.850 --> 17:32.717
so I don't throw up
during the debate.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.751
I would be happy to.

17:33.753 --> 17:34.886
Cool.
All right.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.587
Um, Obamacare.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.855
(inhales deeply)

17:37.857 --> 17:40.091
Obamacare
is the greatest thing to...

17:42.595 --> 17:44.095
No, I can't do it.
I'm gonna need a bucket.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.299
♪♪

17:49.035 --> 17:51.436
Vanessa?
Honey?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.537
(sighs)

17:52.539 --> 17:53.738
Hi.
What were you doing?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.073
Hey, well,
since we're gonna need

17:55.075 --> 17:56.908
to check out Kyle's church
for the wedding,

17:56.910 --> 17:58.709
I was looking
for my roller skates.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.344
(sighs)

18:00.346 --> 18:02.013
Look, I-I'm sorry about
what happened with the pastor.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.082
No, I think it was great
what you did.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.450
He was really
coming after us,

18:05.452 --> 18:06.584
and for someone
who loves France,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.419
you really held
your ground.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.355
Well, you know,
he was wrong.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.857
We make our decisions
together.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.759
You have always respected
my input.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.127
I do respect your input.
Yeah.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.196
But this time,
the decision's unilateral.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.366
"The Hopeless Romantic's Guide
to Paris"?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.036
I paid some lady to go buy that
at a bookstore for me.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.974
We're going to France.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.609
Oh, oh,
there's that bully

18:31.611 --> 18:34.612
that Reverend Paul
was talking about right there.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.814
Okay, okay,
but only under one condition.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.316
-No conditions.
-Yes, one condition.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.750
We're going --
we're going to France.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.086
We also find some nice
camping areas nearby.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.255
Deal.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.756
We'll take some cheese

18:45.758 --> 18:47.425
and a couple nice bottles
of coffee.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.426
Oh, yeah.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.927
(both laugh)

18:49.929 --> 18:51.762
As far as church
is concerned,

18:51.764 --> 18:54.132
I'll go have a little chat
with Reverend Bo Diddley.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.967
(sighs)
No, it's okay.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.137
Maybe -- Maybe we need
to start a new tradition.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.771
Like --
Like letting the kids

19:00.773 --> 19:02.840
figure out where they want
to get married themselves.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.842
Um, Reverend Paul
has a message for you guys.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.777
Yeah, I got a little message
for Reverend Paul...

19:06.779 --> 19:07.078
Uh...
...right about -- Hey!

19:07.080 --> 19:09.580
Hey!

19:09.582 --> 19:11.015
Welcome to our home.
(chuckles)

19:11.017 --> 19:13.851
I would've called earlier,

19:13.853 --> 19:16.687
but I like catching people
doing stuff.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.190
I-I need to apologize to you.
No, no.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.958
Not for what I said,
but for how I said it.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.661
Well, I think
we've all prayerfully considered

19:23.663 --> 19:25.063
what happened earlier.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.464
Eh, let's forget
the prayerfully stuff.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.049
You're not at work.
Sit down.

19:28.050 --> 19:29.633
Can I get you something
to drink? Wine? A wafer?

19:29.636 --> 19:30.034
Oh, no.
Thank you.

19:31.104 --> 19:34.505
I've realized that

19:34.507 --> 19:37.975
while part of my responsibility
is to teach,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.944
I also want to be that pastor
that listens and learns.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.513
And on the subject
of a strong marriage,

19:42.515 --> 19:43.114
I can definitely learn
from you two.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.982
(Chuckles)

19:44.984 --> 19:46.617
Just like
Kyle and Mandy have.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.186
Reverend Paul said we can
get married in the church!

19:48.188 --> 19:49.854
(gasps) Hey, that's wonderful.
Yeah.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.357
But he still won't let me
release 600 doves inside.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.460
Really appreciate
how this worked out.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.929
Butterflies?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.132
Kyle and Mandy's wedding
is gonna be very special.

20:01.134 --> 20:04.068
And it'll be the first reception
we have in the rec hall.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.670
Ah, you haven't been here
for very long.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.971
The church doesn't have
a rec hall.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.406
(chuckles)

20:08.408 --> 20:09.073
That's the other reason
I stopped by.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.686
Hey, Mike.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.770
Hey, come on in.

20:22.771 --> 20:23.853
Just came by
to bring back your tools.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.258
Yeah, a man needs
his own tools, Ryan.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.926
I totally understand.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.094
That's why I got them back
to you as quick as I could.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.664
A man would've understood
what I meant there.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.101
Hey.
How was your debate?

20:37.103 --> 20:39.537
Great.
I destroyed Derrick Lowe.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.739
Good for you.
Did you keep it civil?

20:41.741 --> 20:42.907
Use the talking points
we rehearsed?

20:42.909 --> 20:45.276
Mm, actually,
I went another way.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.078
In my opening statement,
I reminded everyone

20:47.080 --> 20:48.412
of the time in third grade

20:48.414 --> 20:50.114
Derrick had to use
his emergency pants.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.584
(chuckles)
Classic.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.987
(air hisses)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.090
That's not debating.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.191
But it's winning.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.425
See,
that is the problem

21:01.427 --> 21:02.977
with conservatives --

21:02.978 --> 21:04.528
they don't debate, they insult.
Yeah.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.430
You know, I never noticed
how small your hands were.
