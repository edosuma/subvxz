WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:07.374
I'll never forget it.
It was 30 years ago.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.076
I was spraying activator
in my Jheri curl

00:10.143 --> 00:12.746
when this lanky kid wandered
into my bowling alley.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.081
Never picked up a ball
in his life,

00:15.148 --> 00:18.051
but I knew right away
he was a natural.

00:18.118 --> 00:21.321
An untamed horse
just waiting to be broken.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.758
Now, I don't want
to take all the credit

00:24.824 --> 00:26.426
for Tom becoming a pro bowler...

00:26.493 --> 00:27.460
Wait for it.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.628
But if it wasn't for me,

00:28.695 --> 00:29.662
it never would've happened.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.031
There it is.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.068
I am proud
to officially announce

00:35.135 --> 00:39.239
the very first PBA member ever
to come out of Archie's Lanes,

00:39.305 --> 00:41.241
Tom Smallwood. Tell the people
how you did it, Tom.

00:44.411 --> 00:49.082
I had, uh, over a 200 average
in 36 games of league play.

00:51.684 --> 00:54.287
Great bowler, lousy storyteller.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.456
Just show 'em the card, Tom.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.292
{\an3}(laughs)

00:59.359 --> 01:01.194
{\an5}(applause, laughter)

00:59.359 --> 01:01.194
{\an3}Yeah, man.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.397
{\an5}To Tom. Mm.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.397
ALL:
To Tom.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.433
Come on, honey.
It's a school night.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.667
Okay, you stay and have fun.
This is your night.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.269
Mwah.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.437
{\an5}Bye-bye. Bye, pal.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.437
{\an3}Bye, Dad.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.439
{\an5}Bye, honey.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.439
{\an3}Hey, man.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.574
{\an3}Your manager has
a surprise for you.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.377
{\an1}Lew, I told you
I don't need a manager.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.279
Oh, then I guess you don't need

01:19.345 --> 01:23.082
{\an3}an exclusive television
interview... on television.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.319
What are you talking about?

01:26.386 --> 01:28.221
{\an3}I know a guy at
the Channel Ten news.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.423
{\an3}He likes the idea
of a feel-good story

01:30.490 --> 01:32.859
about a laid-off factory
worker chasing a dream.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.761
Channel Ten? Ooh.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.696
{\an1}They got the nice van with
the big satellite dish on top.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.431
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.333
They got Doppler.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.303
I don't know what the hell
that is, but they got it.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.238
Wow. My first TV interview.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.207
Thanks, Lew.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.275
Thanks, Manager.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.379
You just made everyone

01:53.446 --> 01:56.149
{\an3}at Lew Can Do It
Entertainment very happy.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.630
{\an7}Hey.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.630
{\an8}You're late.

02:10.697 --> 02:11.831
{\an7}Yeah, sorry. I was getting
ready for the interview.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.199
{\an8}In...? What interview?

02:13.266 --> 02:15.201
{\an8}With Channel Ten.

02:15.268 --> 02:16.636
{\an8}They got the nice van
with the big satellite on top.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.872
{\an8}Well, you could've gave me
a warning.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.341
{\an8}I didn't even wax my head.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.476
{\an8}Actually, I-I think
they just want to interview me.

02:23.543 --> 02:27.480
{\an8}Oh. Well, listen, don't forget
to mention Archie's Lanes...

02:27.547 --> 02:29.782
{\an8}It's showtime, baby. Look, the
news van just pulled up. Here.

02:29.849 --> 02:32.685
{\an8}Put this hat on.

02:29.849 --> 02:32.685
{\an9}What? Why?

02:32.752 --> 02:34.754
{\an8}Well, because you either need
a look or a big personality.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.523
{\an8}And we're going with a look.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.860
{\an9}I've never been
on TV before. I...

02:40.927 --> 02:42.328
{\an7}Oh, it's easy.
Just-just be your smartest,

02:42.395 --> 02:44.564
{\an8}most professional self.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.834
{\an7}The hat will do
the heavy lifting.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.270
{\an9}I appreciate it, Lew,
but I-I'm not really a hat guy.

02:50.336 --> 02:55.208
{\an7}Here, man.
Bam! Yeah.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.243
{\an8}You better grab your luggage,
'cause you have just arrived.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.415
{\an8}How do I look?

03:02.482 --> 03:04.951
{\an8}Like Samuel L. Jackass.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.291
{\an8}Well, henceforth, you know,

03:11.357 --> 03:12.892
{\an9}being a professional bowler
has always been my dream.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.794
{\an9}And I-I never would
have gotten here

03:14.861 --> 03:16.496
{\an9}without the support
of my family.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.631
{\an8}Hence... forth.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.967
{\an8}There you have it.
Tom Smallwood

03:21.034 --> 03:24.504
{\an8}reminding us all
to bowl-ieve in our dreams.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.274
{\an8}How amazing was that?

03:28.341 --> 03:30.877
{\an7}I don't know. Did you get paid
by the "henceforth"?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.315
{\an9}I thought you looked
very handsome.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.583
{\an8}What'd you think of the hat?

03:36.649 --> 03:38.518
{\an9}I thought you looked
very handsome.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.955
{\an8}Okay, honey, let's
get ready for bed.

03:42.021 --> 03:42.789
{\an8}(clears throat)

03:42.021 --> 03:42.789
{\an8}Good night, Dad.

03:42.855 --> 03:43.923
{\an8}Night.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.325
{\an8}Good night, Pumpkin.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.794
{\an8}Good night, Grandma.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.564
{\an8}Well, I guess I should be
heading home. Henceforth.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.867
{\an7}Come on, Ma.
What did you think?

03:54.934 --> 03:57.236
{\an8}That's a big deal.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.236
{\an8}Ah, you did great.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.472
{\an9}Now get your big head down here
and give your mother a kiss.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.375
{\an9}Good night.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.375
{\an8}Good night.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.647
{\an8}(bowling pins clattering,
indistinct chatter)

04:07.714 --> 04:09.482
Maybe I am a hat guy.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.356
Hey, Arch, you, uh...
you see the interview?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.857
{\an5}Yeah, I saw it.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.857
{\an3}Get this.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.358
{\an3}I go to the gas
station this morning,

04:19.425 --> 04:20.994
asked the guy if he saw it.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.695
{\an3}He hadn't, so I show it
to him on my phone.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.431
Next thing you know, he's
giving me a free Big Gulp.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.467
{\an3}I didn't even want it,
but, you know, free stuff.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.638
Congratulations.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.273
{\an1}Can we start bowling now?
And take that damn hat off,

04:34.340 --> 04:35.908
LL Not Cool J.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.045
Hey, man.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.780
Got some great news.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.749
I was at Powell's Mortuary
this morning

04:42.815 --> 04:45.051
to pick up some flowers
for a date tonight.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.553
Man, you are just begging
to be haunted, aren't you?

04:47.620 --> 04:50.490
Anyway, I was talking
to Powell himself.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.291
He saw your interview
on the news,

04:52.358 --> 04:53.726
and he wants
to sponsor you, man.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.328
He loves what you stand for.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.296
Really? What do I stand for?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.898
Yeah, you're an everyman.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.667
He-he buries five guys
like you every day.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.804
I mean, great.
What are we talking?

05:04.871 --> 05:06.673
Commercials? Endorsements?

05:06.739 --> 05:08.307
Are they gonna put my name
on a casket?

05:08.374 --> 05:10.943
No. They want to put their logo
on your jersey.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.680
That's great. I can have
Archie's logo on the back

05:13.746 --> 05:15.081
and, uh, Powell on the front.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.550
Yeah, about that.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.385
Since Powell's putting up
real money,

05:19.452 --> 05:20.653
they want exclusive rights.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.988
So you can only
have their logo

05:22.055 --> 05:22.755
{\an3}on your jersey
during tournaments.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.991
Oh.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.527
What about Archie?

05:27.593 --> 05:30.029
Well, Archie's just gonna have
to be more of a silent partner.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.865
Archie? He's never been
a silent anything.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.837
Th-This is a huge opportunity
to get some cash coming in.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.406
I mean, that's true,
and we're gonna need money

05:40.473 --> 05:42.408
for equipment and-and travel.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.810
Archie's a businessman.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.411
{\an5}He'll understand.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.411
{\an3}Exactly.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.080
And-and plus, Powell said

05:47.146 --> 05:48.981
he'd give us all
a family and friends discount.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.584
And he said
he'd cremate us feet first.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.486
I mean, you normally don't get
to pick that.

05:57.457 --> 06:01.094
It was so cool seeing Tom on TV.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.563
The closest I ever got
to dating a professional athlete

06:03.629 --> 06:05.631
was when I slept with a referee.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.736
But you know the guy at Foot
Locker wasn't really a referee.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.672
Yeah. And I wasn't really
J.Lo's sister,

06:12.739 --> 06:14.474
but we both got what we wanted.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.744
{\an6}Hey, Jen.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.744
Oh, hey, Lee.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.447
Okay. Are we doing the usual?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.449
Actually, no.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.650
My mom finally said it's okay

06:24.717 --> 06:26.419
for me
to do something different.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.721
So, I want
to do super short pink bangs.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.890
Ooh, I like that.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.459
And maybe, like,
pink tips on the bottom?

06:33.526 --> 06:36.162
{\an3}Love that. (laughs)
Okay, um, let's get...

06:36.229 --> 06:38.164
Excuse us for a second.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.999
{\an5}Hold on.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.999
{\an3}Pink?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.868
{\an3}You know what kind
of salon we are.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.970
We don't do pink here.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.172
Natural colors only,

06:46.239 --> 06:50.143
{\an3}and if someone has a very good
reason, strawberry blonde.

06:50.209 --> 06:54.514
Uh, she's young. She's just
trying to express herself.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.783
{\an3}And there are plenty of salons
where she can do that,

06:56.849 --> 06:58.718
like that goofy one downtown

06:58.785 --> 07:01.087
with aromatherapy
and a hookah bar.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.559
{\an3}We cater to the
traditional clientele.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.796
{\an4}I know.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.796
{\an3}She can express herself
with short, medium and long.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.565
{\an3}It's not like
we don't offer choices.

07:12.632 --> 07:16.169
But that's not what she wants.
What am I supposed to tell her?

07:16.235 --> 07:19.539
{\an3}Tell her if she wants to rebel,
she can buy a jean jacket.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.744
{\an3}(sighs)

07:25.745 --> 07:27.013
Hey, guess what.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.081
I had a chance
to do something creative

07:29.148 --> 07:31.083
and cool for my client today,
and Ruth squashed it.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.552
I'm sorry.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.920
It's just frustrating.

07:33.986 --> 07:34.887
It's not why
I became a hairdresser.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.989
{\an5}Yeah, I know.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.989
{\an3}Like, yes,

07:37.056 --> 07:39.125
I started off washing heads,
never thinking,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.594
ten years later,
I'd still be working for Ruth

07:41.661 --> 07:43.196
in a salon
that's frozen in time.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.497
{\an3}I hear you.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.232
How was your day?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.902
I actually have
some pretty great news.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.472
But, you know--
ugh, that darn Ruth!

07:53.539 --> 07:54.540
Just tell me.

07:54.607 --> 07:55.908
Okay, good.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.643
I, uh, I got an
actual sponsor.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.745
Like, a money sponsor.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.480
{\an5}That's fantastic.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.480
Yeah, I know.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.882
It's not a lot,
but it'll help cover some

08:02.949 --> 08:04.684
of the bowling expenses.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.018
And if we ever want
to get cremated feet first,

08:06.085 --> 08:07.687
I have an in.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.189
No. We talked about this.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.991
{\an1}I want to be buried
in one of those boxes that grows

08:12.058 --> 08:13.893
{\an1}into a tree so Sam has a place
to cry every day.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.598
Can it be an apple tree so
we don't have to bring snacks?

08:20.199 --> 08:21.801
Sure. Mm-hmm.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.801
{\an3}Thank you.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.703
Check it out.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.942
A mortuary?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.510
Yeah. I know
it's kind of creepy,

08:31.577 --> 08:32.678
but I feel like
I can just lean into it,

08:32.745 --> 08:34.647
make it part of my brand.

08:34.714 --> 08:35.948
Like, after the match,
go up to the other bowlers

08:36.015 --> 08:39.652
and be like,
"So sorry for your loss."

08:39.719 --> 08:43.256
But, uh, hold on. What about
the jersey that Archie gave you?

08:43.322 --> 08:44.557
Well, I can only wear this one
during tournaments.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.791
That's what the deal is.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.026
What did Archie say?

08:47.093 --> 08:49.862
I-I didn't tell Archie yet. I...

08:49.929 --> 08:51.597
Oh.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.032
But, you know,
this is, like, a real sponsor,

08:53.099 --> 08:55.134
like the ones
the bowlers on tour have.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.770
{\an6}Uh-huh.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.770
{\an1}And I feel like
me getting recognized like this

08:57.837 --> 09:00.172
{\an1}also reflects
on Archie as a coach.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.608
So you're just gonna
tell him that?

09:02.675 --> 09:04.744
I see what this is.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.613
{\an1}But I've broken bad news
to Archie plenty of times.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.615
I know how to do it.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.150
{\an1}After all, I was the one
that told him

09:11.217 --> 09:12.752
{\an1}gluten-free cookies
still aren't that great for you.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.054
If you say so.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.789
Okay, see, I know what

09:16.856 --> 09:18.224
{\an5}"If you say so" means.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.224
{\an1}Mm.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.258
{\an3}It's like when we tell
Sam "Maybe," or I tell you

09:19.325 --> 09:21.560
"I'll look at it tomorrow."

09:21.627 --> 09:23.596
We're all very polite liars!

09:28.701 --> 09:30.703
{\an1}Hey, you ready?
Today we're working

09:30.770 --> 09:31.938
{\an1}on your release
and follow-through.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.140
{\an1}I hope you wore
your tight underwear

09:34.206 --> 09:35.775
{\an1}'cause you're about
to bowl your ass off.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.877
{\an3}(laughs)

09:37.944 --> 09:40.012
{\an3}Look, Archie, I-I'm
a little worried, man.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.314
{\an3}We got our first
tournament coming up,

09:41.380 --> 09:43.182
and I'm short on equipment.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.685
I mean, look.
My-my bag's all crapped out,

09:45.751 --> 09:47.253
my shoes are older than Sam,

09:47.320 --> 09:48.988
{\an3}and I only got
one decent ball.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.656
{\an1}Don't worry
about that right now.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.591
It's all I can think about.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.127
{\an3}I mean, Arch, that money has
to come from somewhere.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.730
{\an1}Once your career takes off,
the money'll come.

09:57.797 --> 10:01.000
{\an1}Tournament winnings,
endorsements, sponsors.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.136
It's a crazy coincidence
that you said "sponsors."

10:06.105 --> 10:07.673
I think I just got one.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.376
{\an4}You did?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.376
Yeah. Powell's Mortuary.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.178
{\an3}They're-they're gonna
give us real money.

10:12.244 --> 10:15.214
{\an4}Huh.

10:12.244 --> 10:15.214
I mean, how great is that?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.350
{\an3}They only thing is, I can
only wear their jersey

10:17.416 --> 10:19.118
{\an3}during tournaments,
but still, high five!

10:20.386 --> 10:24.223
{\an1}So you made this decision
without talking to me first?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.726
I-I'm talking to you now.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.627
{\an3}This is good
for both of us.

10:28.694 --> 10:31.097
{\an3}It means I'm a legit pro bowler.
It's good for my brand.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.400
Oh, I didn't realize
you have a brand now.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.402
{\an3}Come on, Arch.
It-It's business.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.772
{\an3}We both benefit.
You understand, right?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.907
Of course I understand.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.676
No big deal.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.345
Where are you going?

10:46.412 --> 10:48.814
{\an3}I just got to take care
of some business.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.320
(clears throat)

10:54.387 --> 10:57.857
{\an5}(microphone squealing)

10:54.387 --> 10:57.857
{\an3}Lane five, your
nachos are ready.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.926
{\an3}And, Smallwood, you
have five minutes

11:00.993 --> 11:03.896
{\an3}to clear out your locker, or
your stuff goes in the dumpster.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.202
{\an3}I'd make fun of you, but
my nachos are ready, so...

11:17.043 --> 11:17.977
What the hell is going on?

11:18.044 --> 11:19.979
{\an4}Nothing.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.979
{\an3}Nothing?

11:20.046 --> 11:20.980
You just took away my locker.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.948
If you need somewhere

11:23.015 --> 11:24.784
to store your stuff,

11:24.850 --> 11:27.820
perhaps Powell's Mortuary has
an empty casket you can use.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.825
{\an3}I knew it. It's
about the jersey.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.727
You know, I was really hoping
you'd see the bigger picture.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.429
It's not just the jersey.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.364
It's the interview
and that stupid hat

11:38.431 --> 11:39.265
and that swollen head
that's in it.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.202
{\an3}I get a lot of
compliments on this hat.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.304
You don't get it.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.773
{\an1}I had this whole thing
planned out.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.775
First we win a few tournaments,

11:49.842 --> 11:52.178
{\an1}then we get some big money
from a big sponsor.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.747
{\an1}You think Nike would
have called Tiger Woods

11:54.814 --> 11:57.149
{\an1}if he was wearing a jersey from
a bunch of damn gravediggers?

11:57.216 --> 11:59.752
Nike's not calling. Powell is.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.954
He says he believes in me.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.424
Oh, good. You finally found
somebody who believes in you.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.462
You know what I meant!

12:11.831 --> 12:12.965
He knows what I meant.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.404
{\an5}Thanks for doing this.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.404
Oh, are you kidding?

12:18.471 --> 12:21.740
{\an3}This is the kind of cool, edgy
stuff I dream about doing.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.276
{\an3}Finally, I get to do a hairstyle
that doesn't scream,

12:24.343 --> 12:27.413
"Tom Selleck is the
Sexiest Man Alive."

12:27.480 --> 12:29.882
{\an1}I hope I'm as cool
as you when I'm old.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.754
Okay, uh, why don't
we let this soak in

12:35.821 --> 12:37.490
while I let that soak in?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.259
Unbelievable.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.461
Oh, hey, honey.
This is Lee.

12:42.528 --> 12:45.231
{\an5}Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:42.528 --> 12:45.231
Oh, she's not listening.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.899
Good. Unbelievable!

12:49.335 --> 12:51.270
{\an5}What's wrong?

12:49.335 --> 12:51.270
It's Archie.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.038
He completely overreacted.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.507
{\an1}The one guy
who's supposed to have my back

12:54.573 --> 12:57.143
{\an5}kicked me out of my locker.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.143
Oh, so the whole,

12:57.209 --> 12:59.912
"Don't worry. I'll handle
Archie" thing didn't work out.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.213
Really? We're-we're gonna review
the game tape while I'm down?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.915
That's...

13:02.982 --> 13:05.184
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.520
{\an1}Apparently, I'm an egomaniac.
How can he not see

13:07.586 --> 13:09.221
that everything
I'm doing is for us?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.023
I-I wouldn't even be a bowler
if it weren't for him.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.025
{\an6}Right.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.025
He's like a father to me.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.161
{\an5}That's true.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.161
{\an1}The last person
I'd want to let down is Archie.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.862
I know.
So why are you doing that?

13:18.264 --> 13:20.799
{\an5}You're right.
I-I got to fix this.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.799
{\an3}Okay.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.173
{\an4}Archibald.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.173
Helen.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.974
{\an1}I brought supper.
Where's Tommy?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.843
{\an3}Not here.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.178
When's he coming back?

13:32.244 --> 13:33.512
{\an3}Don't know.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.014
What's going on?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.050
{\an3}Ask him.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.954
Well, I'm asking you.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.055
We had a dustup.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.423
A big one.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.092
{\an1}You guys don't have time
for dustups.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.827
My son put his family at risk

13:48.894 --> 13:51.263
{\an1}to follow a dream
that you told him he could do.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.599
Well, apparently,
he doesn't need me.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.602
{\an1}Oh, for God's sake,
is that what this is about?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.404
You may want to stop
spraying those shoes

13:58.470 --> 13:59.605
so you can start
sucking your thumb.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.177
Talking about somebody
believing in him.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.580
Well, guess who believed in him
since the beginning. Me.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.982
I know that. So does he.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.251
Well, he didn't even mention me
in that damn interview.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.486
What the hell are
you talking about?

14:14.553 --> 14:17.122
He said he wouldn't be
where he is without his family.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.959
Well, I hate to break it to you,
bonehead, you are his family.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.368
{\an3}Hey, um... what...
what's that?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.170
{\an3}Is that your
seven-layer lasagna there?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.039
You know damn well it is.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.576
But you don't get a bite of it

14:37.643 --> 14:39.011
until you work things
out with Tommy.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.546
{\an3}(whiny):
Aw.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.121
{\an1}Incentive.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.576
{\an5}Could I...?

15:07.539 --> 15:10.576
Oh! Yeah! (exhales)

15:14.546 --> 15:16.448
You almost had yourself a sale.
(laughs)

15:16.515 --> 15:19.084
{\an5}Oh.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.084
{\an1}What?

15:19.151 --> 15:23.222
{\an1}Is this <i> the</i> Tom Smallwood
in my showroom? I...

15:23.289 --> 15:25.157
{\an5}I'm Jacob Powell.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.157
{\an3}Oh, my goodness.
So nice to meet you.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.027
Oh, you probably don't want to
do that. It's been a busy day.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.098
So, uh, what brings you by?

15:33.165 --> 15:36.135
{\an3}Well, Mr. Powell, I wanted
to talk to you about my jersey.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.170
I really appreciate you
wanting to sponsor me,

15:38.237 --> 15:40.306
but it would mean a lot
if I could have the logo

15:40.372 --> 15:42.274
{\an3}for Archie's Lanes
on there, too.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.944
{\an1}Uh, no. You see, the logo rule
is the same as the casket rule--

15:46.011 --> 15:48.380
one per customer.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.684
{\an3}I mean, can't you just
make an exception?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.352
For the logo, not the casket.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.387
I get that one.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.223
{\an1}Tom, if there's one thing
I've learned

15:58.290 --> 16:01.660
in the body box business,
it's that life is short.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.696
And unless people stop dying,
I'm going to be putting money

16:03.762 --> 16:06.498
{\an1}in your pockets
for a very long time.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.233
Now, I get it.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.536
{\an1}The bowling alley guy
helped you out.

16:10.602 --> 16:14.673
{\an1}But what you need to think
about right now is your family.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.176
{\an1}Right?

16:17.242 --> 16:19.311
Right.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.347
Ah, yeah. Ooh.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.248
{\an1}You're a tall one,
aren't you?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.117
Yeah, we have to cut guys
like you off at the knees.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.388
Yeah, I'm kidding.
We don't do that.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.556
Uh, anymore.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.396
{\an6}So, I followed up
with Foot Locker guy.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.396
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.566
He's bald, overweight,
really let himself go.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.369
{\an1}You're still gonna hook up
with him, aren't you?

16:43.435 --> 16:46.171
You know J.Lo's sister so well.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.576
So, guess who I just saw

16:50.642 --> 16:54.446
loitering outside the Dairy
Queen with pink bangs and tips.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.116
Lady Gaga?

16:57.182 --> 17:00.386
Jen, I spoke to her.
She told me what you did.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.621
Okay, yes, I did her hair,

17:02.688 --> 17:04.723
{\an1}but I did it in my own home,
on my own time.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.558
That's not the point.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.627
You represent this salon.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.262
{\an3}You've been working
here a long time, Jen.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.700
You know I created a very
specific business model.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.137
{\an3}People come here
knowing what to expect.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.339
{\an1}I mean, don't you want
to evolve a little?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.340
{\an1}I mean, you might actually
get more business.

17:22.407 --> 17:25.144
{\an3}My salon has been
doing just fine

17:25.210 --> 17:28.347
{\an3}for 30 years with the same
rules we've always had.

17:28.414 --> 17:31.250
{\an3}No crazy haircuts, no TV screens
and no breastfeeding.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.320
I know. I've read the sign.

17:36.755 --> 17:40.058
{\an3}When you have your own salon,
you can do it your own way.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.803
{\an1}Hey.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.404
Hey.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.442
{\an4}Look, man,
I-I just want to...

17:52.471 --> 17:56.442
Listen, man.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.243
{\an5}If I could just...

17:56.508 --> 17:58.243
I just need to...

17:58.310 --> 17:59.545
{\an5}You go. You go.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.545
No, you go ahead.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.214
Can I just say something?!

18:02.281 --> 18:05.150
{\an1}I'm sorry. I-I didn't
see an end to that.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.521
{\an4}Here.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.521
What is this?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.523
{\an1}It's a check
from Powell's Mortuary.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.360
{\an3}That guy puts tombstones
on everything, doesn't he?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.129
It's meaningless

18:17.196 --> 18:19.198
{\an1}compared to everything
you've given me over the years.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.400
{\an1}The free lane time,
the lessons.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.402
{\an1}The bike you gave me
so I could get

18:23.469 --> 18:25.103
{\an1}to the bowling alley
after school.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.872
The bottomless curly fries.

18:26.939 --> 18:31.477
Well, the curly fries wasn't
bottomless. Your stomach was.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.346
Arch,<i> you</i> always
believed in me.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.615
{\an1}I forgot that
for a minute, and I'm...

18:36.682 --> 18:39.318
I'm really sorry.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.621
{\an3}I really appreciate
that, Thomas.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.624
{\an3}Look,

18:45.691 --> 18:46.825
and you know that...

18:46.892 --> 18:48.794
{\an1}Yeah.

18:48.861 --> 18:52.798
{\an3}And sometimes,
I can be... eh...

18:52.865 --> 18:55.200
Don't worry about it.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.337
Really feels good
to talk this out.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.341
Listen, on second thought, why
don't you just keep the check?

19:02.407 --> 19:05.310
{\an3}It's just a jersey.
I don't really give a damn.

19:05.377 --> 19:08.347
I do. You're my sponsor
and you always will be.

19:08.413 --> 19:11.283
{\an1}Henceforth.
I do say that too much.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.621
{\an4}Rip it up.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.621
{\an3}You sure?

19:15.687 --> 19:18.390
{\an1}Yes.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.592
{\an1}There's gonna be
a lot more money like that

19:20.659 --> 19:22.828
{\an1}when you and me win
a PBA Championship as a team.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.763
{\an3}I don't think
that's gonna happen.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.867
{\an4}Why?

19:24.830 --> 19:28.867
{\an3}'Cause you can't keep your
damn elbow in on your release.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.337
Now get your ass
down that lane.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.405
We got a lot of work to do.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.710
{\an1}You know,
when you smile real big,

19:38.777 --> 19:40.779
{\an1}the back of your neck
crinkles up like a puppy dog?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.417
Just shut up and bowl.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.527
Thanks again
for the flowers, Lew.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.462
{\an6}Oh, yeah.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.462
{\an1}There's something creepy
about them.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.934
You should've seen 'em
with the sash

20:02.000 --> 20:04.236
that said "Gone too soon."

20:05.971 --> 20:08.407
No, what's gone too soon
is that money from Powell's.

20:08.473 --> 20:12.911
{\an1}Sorry about
all that trouble, by the way.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.414
{\an3}So, how about another piece
of that lasagna, Helen?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.916
{\an5}It was worth the wait.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.916
Well, the secret

20:17.983 --> 20:20.986
is noodles, sauce, meat, cheese,

20:21.053 --> 20:25.457
noodles, sauce,
meat, cheese.

20:25.524 --> 20:29.361
And then you just kind of
keep doing that.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.265
Don't give away
the family recipe, Mom.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.934
(knocking)

20:36.001 --> 20:38.937
Oh, I'll get it. (sighs)

20:41.473 --> 20:43.842
{\an3}Hey. Lee, what are
you doing here?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.278
This is my friend Hannah. She
likes what you did with my hair.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.880
{\an1}Oh, it's dope. Can you do
the same for me except in blue?

20:48.947 --> 20:50.582
{\an3}(sighs) My boss would
have a heart attack

20:50.649 --> 20:51.583
if I did that again.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.586
So come on in.
