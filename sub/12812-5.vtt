00:20.680 --> 00:22.272
It all depends
on what’s buried inside you.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.339
There you have it.
The five finalists

00:24.350 --> 00:28.218
for the title:
"Lady of the lake."

00:28.220 --> 00:29.949
(Screaming)

00:32.930 --> 00:35.649
(People clamoring)

00:35.660 --> 00:38.891
Male officer: Stay back
at this time, all right?

00:41.840 --> 00:44.365
Woman: Hey! Sheriff!
That's our kids in there!

00:44.370 --> 00:46.793
Why won't you
let us see them?
Hey! What's happening?

00:46.810 --> 00:49.165
Female officer: When
we find out more information,
we will update you.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.332
Male officer:
Stay behind the line!
Please cooperate with us!

01:00.050 --> 01:02.382
Hey, get these doors closed.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.653
It's gonna be fine, you guys.
We just need everyone
to gather in the gym

01:07.660 --> 01:09.855
until we know
what to do next...
wrong way, ladies.

01:09.860 --> 01:13.091
We need to get to Brooke.
Ms. lang, please!

01:14.170 --> 01:15.421
Of course.
Come with me.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.398
Excuse us, people!
Coming through!

01:19.670 --> 01:22.309
Do the rules
just not apply to them?

01:23.080 --> 01:24.707
No one comes in or goes out.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.974
I want every single student
accounted for.

01:26.980 --> 01:30.871
_ Ten-four.
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen up!

01:31.920 --> 01:35.378
I'm officially putting
this school into lockdown.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.415
All right,
let's move it!

01:45.070 --> 01:47.868
(Camera shutter
clicking repeatedly)

01:47.870 --> 01:51.397
Maggie: You're doing great,
sweetie. Stay with me.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.301
Why don't you
talk to me, honey?

01:54.310 --> 01:59.270
That night at the pool,
he wanted to take me
to the carnival.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.739
I wanted to say yes.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.172
Oh, sweetie...

02:05.890 --> 02:07.915
Why didn't I say yes?

02:07.920 --> 02:11.117
Brooke, are you okay?
No, no, no!
I'm not finished.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.226
It's evidence. _
It can't be compromised.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.927
Excuse me, doc.
I need Emma and miss Jensen.

02:19.930 --> 02:21.795
Why?
No, please don't
make them leave.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.928
No, we're her friends.
She needs us right now.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.999
Someone should stay.
Maggie: I'm almost
finished, Dwayne.

02:27.010 --> 02:29.467
The girl is in shock.
She's gonna need a hand
to help clean up.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.337
Okay. Emma, you're higher
on the sheriff‘s list
for questioning.

02:33.350 --> 02:37.047
You come with me.
Jensen, you stay. Let's go.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.040
I'm sure they're
just questioning
all of Jake's friends.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.415
It's gonna be okay.
Mm, okay.

02:41.420 --> 02:44.856
I'll come and find you
after the lockdown's lifted.
Okay.

02:44.860 --> 02:49.058
Hey... it's okay.
We've got this.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.857
Yeah, Ijust...

02:56.240 --> 02:58.333
Maggie:
Almost done, honey.

02:58.910 --> 03:02.004
See, Emma? Sheriff's questioning
a lot of people.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.363
Don't worry.

03:04.180 --> 03:08.139
We were friends.
Well, since last October.

03:08.150 --> 03:11.813
Before that, we were,
i don't know, not friends.

03:11.820 --> 03:15.039
But stuff like that,
what we went through
with Piper...

03:15.050 --> 03:16.915
Stuff like that changes you.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.115
It changed us.
Of course.

03:19.130 --> 03:22.179
I want to thank you
for sitting down with me.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.452
This must be rough on you.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.395
Well, we're kind of
used to... (Chuckles)

03:27.400 --> 03:30.324
Yeah, actually,
it's... it's awful.

03:30.340 --> 03:34.162
I'll keep this brief, then.
When was the last time
you saw Jake?

03:34.170 --> 03:37.105
At a party, the other night,
like, five days ago.

03:37.110 --> 03:38.907
So, you hadn't seen Jake
in five days?

03:38.910 --> 03:40.969
Well, nobody had.
He'd had a fight with Brooke,

03:40.980 --> 03:45.849
and she thought he was playing
some sort of elaborate game
of hide-and-seek with her.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.112
For five days?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.247
You have to understand Jake.
I mean...

03:49.260 --> 03:52.115
He went to great lengths to be
a pain in the ass sometimes.

03:52.130 --> 03:55.019
Must've been a little worried.
With something
as terrible as this,

03:55.030 --> 03:58.158
people would rather believe
anything else is happening.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.527
But, now, we know
what's happening, don't we?

04:01.530 --> 04:04.033
What exactly do you think
is happening?

04:04.040 --> 04:09.967
Now that Emma's home,
Piper's accomplice
is finishing the job.

04:19.290 --> 04:22.487
Boy: It's her.
What's she doing here?

04:41.340 --> 04:45.902
I'm so sorry, Emma.
I can't believe this
is happening again.

04:45.910 --> 04:49.038
How's Brooke?
Uh...

04:49.050 --> 04:51.939
She's a mess.
How are you?

04:55.290 --> 04:56.314
Oh, my god.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.289
I am so sorry
about last night.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.178
I should have
never doubted you.

05:01.190 --> 05:04.591
Let's not talk
about that, okay?

05:11.170 --> 05:14.003
(Water running)

05:22.680 --> 05:26.571
I should have
said something.
Brooke: What?

05:26.590 --> 05:28.148
Uh...

05:28.150 --> 05:30.983
Are you okay in there?

05:32.090 --> 05:33.682
No.

05:33.690 --> 05:37.956
No, it just feels like
this awful nightmare.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.497
I mean, it just
doesn't feel real.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.197
We were literally
just texting.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.431
Wait, he texted you?
Yesterday.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.931
See for yourself.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.487
(Reading)
"You'll see me tomorrow."

06:01.490 --> 06:03.685
Okay, that's...
I just keep staring at it.

06:03.690 --> 06:07.956
He said I'd see him today,
and then this happened.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.259
It's just...
It's too weird! (Sighs)

06:11.260 --> 06:14.423
Maybe this text
didn't come from Jake.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.961
What do you mean?
It had to be him.

06:16.970 --> 06:23.705
Unless it happened after.
I mean... I mean,
unless it came from his...

06:25.410 --> 06:27.173
killer.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.411
Is this really
all happening again?

06:31.420 --> 06:35.140
(Suspenseful music playing)

06:35.150 --> 06:38.517
(Scoffs)
Well, they took my clothes.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.681
Do they have anything else
for me to wear,

06:40.690 --> 06:43.523
or do they want me
to wander the halls naked?

06:43.530 --> 06:45.452
Well...

06:48.430 --> 06:50.990
They found this.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.258
Hilarious.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.300
Seriously?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.613
Hey! So, what did he ask you?

07:37.620 --> 07:39.269
Usual stuff. Um...

07:39.290 --> 07:41.281
"When was the last time
you saw the Victim?

07:41.290 --> 07:43.087
Was he acting strangely?"

07:43.090 --> 07:44.216
(Phone vibrates)

07:44.220 --> 07:47.189
Oh, that's probably my mom.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.624
I have to check in with her.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.768
So, did the sheriff say why
they're holding us like this?

08:01.770 --> 08:05.331
No, but I'm sure it's because
they know someone's out there,

08:05.340 --> 08:06.807
which I have been saying
for a long time.

08:06.810 --> 08:09.301
Stavo: You keep saying,
"there's somebody out there."
(Phone vibrating)

08:09.320 --> 08:12.448
Have you not considered
the vintage "locked room"
horror scenario?

08:12.450 --> 08:17.080
When a stranger cal/s?
/(/7//'ng room? De W7? Rope?

08:17.090 --> 08:20.253
Noah: Oh. You're saying
the call is coming
from inside the house.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.728
Yeah, man. What if they think
one of us is the killer?

08:22.730 --> 08:27.599
They didn't lock
the killer out.
They locked him in.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.795
Him or her.
Could be either.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.533
But I guess I should leave
the crazy paranoid talk
to the experts.

08:34.540 --> 08:38.237
Kieran, can I talk to you
for a second?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.278
You okay?

08:49.290 --> 08:51.884
(Suspenseful music playing)

08:51.890 --> 08:54.358
It's Jake's phone. Yeah.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.398
I found it in my backpack.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.289
What the hell?
I emptied my backpack out
last night at home

09:05.300 --> 09:07.165
and it wasn't in there,
so that means that...

09:07.170 --> 09:11.834
Oh, my god. That means
that someone at school
must've put it in there.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.900
The only person
who could have had this...

09:14.910 --> 09:17.174
is the killer. Yes.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.383
Oh, my god, look at her.

09:27.290 --> 09:28.780
Hayley meyers!

09:28.790 --> 09:31.224
What? Me?
I'm Hayley meyers.

09:31.230 --> 09:33.221
The sheriff needs
to talk to you.

09:34.270 --> 09:37.091
What did the sheriff ask you?
I haven't been interviewed yet.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.002
Seriously? Why me?
Why would he...?

09:46.850 --> 09:47.475
Hey.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.504
How is Brooke?

09:48.510 --> 09:51.775
Wrecked. Her dad's on his way,
but, in the meantime,

09:51.780 --> 09:56.240
they're putting her
in solitary, out of gen-pop,
for obvious reasons.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.387
Okay, what is going on?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.411
God...

10:06.930 --> 10:08.921
How did you...?
I don't know.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.795
Someone planted it
in my backpack.

10:13.470 --> 10:18.203
Now, I have to figure out
how to explain all of that
to the cops.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.234
No, no!

10:19.250 --> 10:21.104
Don't go to the cops.
What?

10:21.110 --> 10:25.376
So, some kid turns up dead,
so you lock my son and nephew
inside with the body

10:25.380 --> 10:26.938
and, for all I know,
the killer?

10:26.950 --> 10:28.247
That is not okay!
Caruso!

10:28.250 --> 10:30.184
I trust Anita
and the baby are well?

10:30.190 --> 10:32.818
Right this way,
mayor Maddox.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.479
(People yelling)

10:34.490 --> 10:37.050
That's the mayor?

10:40.830 --> 10:44.789
I'm here... if you want
to talk about anything.

10:47.070 --> 10:48.469
Okay.

10:53.910 --> 10:55.275
(Door opens)

10:55.980 --> 10:59.313
Daddy.
(Whispering)

11:04.120 --> 11:08.181
(Crying)

11:08.190 --> 11:09.919
It might not
be Jake's phone.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.490
I just need to give this
to the sheriff

11:12.500 --> 11:14.127
and let him do his job.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.189
All we know is someone
planted it on you.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.462
They wanted you to find it.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.995
Do you remember what happened
the last time we got played?

11:20.010 --> 11:23.400
You nearly got killed.
Jake is already dead!

11:23.410 --> 11:26.379
I'm sorry, but we know
what's going on now.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.109
Whoever did this
is trying to control us.

11:28.110 --> 11:32.410
It may be a game to them,
but, to us, it's life or death.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.308
Oh, my god.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.605
Please don't ignore me.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.344
I'm so sorry.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.545
I was trying to ignore
the fact that something
horrible happened.

12:07.550 --> 12:13.511
Are you talking
about what happened in
the auditorium, or last night?

12:13.530 --> 12:15.088
Both.
I'm sorry, Zoe, if...

12:15.090 --> 12:18.196
Look, talking about
last night after all this
is kind of ridiculous,

12:18.200 --> 12:20.498
and I'm not sure I'm up
for the other conversation,

12:20.500 --> 12:22.092
so can you just...

12:22.100 --> 12:24.637
Let me keep trying
to ignore both.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.435
We all have
our ways of coping.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.232
But, if you need to talk...

12:36.550 --> 12:39.610
go ahead.
Not if you're
uncomfortable, or...

12:39.620 --> 12:44.512
I'm fine.
It's probably healthier
not to ignore it. So, um...

12:45.220 --> 12:48.018
Do you think
it's starting up again?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.088
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.092
Why did he do it
like that? So public?

12:57.100 --> 12:59.159
It was an announcement,
a coming-out party,

12:59.170 --> 13:00.990
a classic end-of—act—one
body drop.

13:01.010 --> 13:03.103
So, like, what?
The killer's emboldened now?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.429
Exactly.
We're starting act two.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.704
That, unfortunately, means
we've all got bull's-eyes
on our backs.

13:06.710 --> 13:10.669
Unless...
somebody figures out who it is
and tries to stop them.

13:10.680 --> 13:15.708
Hopefully.
Yeah, well, that's the job
for the final girl.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.019
Or the hero.

13:22.430 --> 13:25.092
I'm a huge fan of the morgue.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.620
I love your voice,

13:26.630 --> 13:29.667
and I think that you make...

13:29.670 --> 13:32.389
The morbid beautiful.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.196
Oh, well, thank you.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.008
Now that I've had
a front row seat,
i get it...

13:37.010 --> 13:38.272
Why you do it.
I'm all ears.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.977
I think maybe you're sublimating
your feelings about mortality

13:41.980 --> 13:44.676
and turning your friend's death
into a puzzle you can solve,

13:44.680 --> 13:47.274
without actually
dealing with it.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.439
Ouch.

13:48.450 --> 13:52.750
I'm sorry.
No, no. You're...
you're probably right.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.284
(Sighs)

13:55.290 --> 13:58.396
We all have
our ways of coping.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.266
He wanted to talk to me
about that thing with Jensen
at the movie theater.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.167
Dude, they're searching
everybody's lockers.

14:10.180 --> 14:14.332
Let's go.
I know. Scary.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.705
(Students murmuring)
What's with
all the brouhaha?

14:16.720 --> 14:21.282
People are freaking
because someone said
they're searching lockers.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.541
Oh, no.
What?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.551
Nothing.
What is going on?

14:24.560 --> 14:28.052
I-i have something in my locker
I'd rather the cops didn't find.

14:28.060 --> 14:30.449
Uh, do you know
how suspicious that sounds?

14:30.460 --> 14:32.052
Yeah, I gotta get
to my locker.

14:32.060 --> 14:33.322
How are you gonna do that?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.399
I-i need help.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.197
Don't look at me.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.339
Hey, what do you have
in your locker?

14:38.340 --> 14:41.138
Don't worry about it.
I'll be right back.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.664
Oh, I can't believe
he just said that.

14:42.680 --> 14:46.332
Um, okay, yeah, I'll go
with him, keep a lookout.

14:46.350 --> 14:48.409
Are you sure about that?
Yes.

14:48.410 --> 14:50.469
Audrey:
What? Why?

14:55.590 --> 14:58.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!
My friend is about to vomit.

14:58.220 --> 15:01.519
Can you please take us
to the ladies' room?
No, I can't...

15:01.530 --> 15:04.351
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on. Let's go.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.795
Noah:
Wow, that was easy.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.637
Hey, what exactly
is in your locker?

15:26.490 --> 15:29.846
(Suspenseful music playing)

15:37.830 --> 15:40.526
Hey! You're not supposed
to be out here.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.794
I was just coming back
from the bathroom, deputy.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let me see the bag.

15:46.540 --> 15:48.701
Let me see the bag.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.677
(Mouthing)

16:03.790 --> 16:05.678
So, how do you want
to do this?

16:05.690 --> 16:07.555
Just cuff me, sheriff.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.187
My dad was a cop.
I know how this works.

16:09.190 --> 16:12.296
And you were arrested before.
I do my homework.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.689
So, you know there's
a lot of ways it can play out.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.895
There seems
to be one 0bVIOUS one.

16:16.900 --> 16:17.969
Not really...

16:17.970 --> 16:19.858
Because someone
who goes to the trouble

16:19.870 --> 16:21.701
to stage a big show
like the one that we just saw,

16:21.710 --> 16:26.977
doesn't make the mistake
of leaving a gun
in his locker, right?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.049
It's my dad's gun.
Yeah.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.938
I carry it to protect
myself and my friends.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.738
I suppose that's understandable
after what you've been through.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.752
Thank you
for recognizing that.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.587
I don't blame you
for needing to feel safe.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.056
I'm gonna confiscate
this weapon,

16:44.060 --> 16:49.088
but I'm willing to look past
this entire episode, if...

16:49.100 --> 16:51.295
If...?
If you let me keep
an eye on you.

16:51.300 --> 16:55.236
I think it'd be good for you
to come down to the station.
I may put you to work.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.731
Look, I don't have to tell you.
Cops take care of their own.

16:57.740 --> 17:00.971
Okay? Your dad would've done
the same thing for my kid.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.142
Not my dad.

17:04.150 --> 17:09.884
And don't get me wrong,
i appreciate you
not cuffing me, but...

17:09.890 --> 17:14.623
This whole good cop routine,
it's not playing.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.053
What do you
really want, sheriff?

17:20.130 --> 17:24.226
I want an in, and you're
gonna get me there...

17:24.240 --> 17:27.698
Or you'll be arrested,
put on probation,

17:27.710 --> 17:30.008
and kicked out of school.

17:31.980 --> 17:33.607
Your choice.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.975
(Sighs)

17:40.820 --> 17:43.288
May I offer you
a phone plan?

17:43.290 --> 17:45.281
Okay, if you're trying
to be funny, don't.

17:45.290 --> 17:49.954
I, uh... couldn't help
but overhear. (Chuckles)

17:49.960 --> 17:52.053
And, by "overhear,"
you mean creep?

17:52.060 --> 17:54.051
One man's creep,
is another man's...

17:54.070 --> 17:55.196
Creep.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.293
Okay, I was going
to say "stalker."

17:57.300 --> 17:59.029
(Chuckles)

18:02.210 --> 18:03.632
Okay, what's your plan?

18:03.640 --> 18:05.232
Ditch it.
Fast as you can.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.208
Yes. Thank you.
How would I?

18:07.210 --> 18:10.373
Wipe off any prints
and stick it somewhere
they'll find it.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.917
Behind a book
or in the garbage.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.309
Then, it's not connected
to you anymore.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.881
(Phone vibrating)

18:24.730 --> 18:25.992
Hey.
Kieran got busted.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.367
He had a gun in his locker.
He brought his gun to school?

18:29.370 --> 18:32.066
Now, I'm trapped in the hallway,
and I have no idea how to get

18:32.070 --> 18:34.868
back into the learning center
without being nabbed,

18:34.870 --> 18:37.304
'cause there's
cops everywhere.

18:47.450 --> 18:51.113
I just saw Kieran. He was
with acosta and a deputy.
Are they arresting him?

18:51.120 --> 18:54.851
Could be an arrest,
but, oddly, could also be
a hero walk from
the avengers.

18:54.860 --> 18:58.352
Whatever it is,
they're very focused.
Okay, I gotta go.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.828
Look, give me Jake's phone.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.822
I'll get rid of it for you.
No, i-i can't ask you
to do that.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.106
I want to. It's one less
miserable thing for you
to deal with today.

19:08.110 --> 19:10.761
Plus, I'll do it
better than you.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.483
Emma duval!

19:22.720 --> 19:26.451
(Students whispering)

19:29.060 --> 19:31.949
I hear you have something
you want to show me.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.105
Follow us, please.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.483
You ratted her out.
Shut up.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.330
Kieran made it back.

20:20.350 --> 20:23.979
But not happily.
(Ringtone playing)

20:24.450 --> 20:27.146
Hey! What happened to you?

20:27.950 --> 20:30.487
We failed,
they took Kieran away,
and now they're taking Emma,

20:30.490 --> 20:32.549
and I ended up trapped
out in the halls.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.255
Kieran's back,
but he doesn't look

20:34.260 --> 20:36.125
like he wants to chat,
so who knows?

20:36.130 --> 20:37.427
This Is so screwed up.

20:37.430 --> 20:40.354
Somebody planted
Jake's phone in Emma's bag.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.065
Wait, what? That's why
they're taking her?

20:42.070 --> 20:48.202
I don't know,
but they walked her out of here
like some sort of criminal.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.203
I'm starting to think the person
that they should be questioning

20:52.210 --> 20:53.438
is sitting right here.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.372
Who are you talking about?

21:01.020 --> 21:05.354
So, you have no idea
how that phone wound up
in your backpack?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.851
No, but whoever
put it in there

21:07.860 --> 21:10.522
is probably the same person
who attacked me last night

21:10.530 --> 21:13.397
and probably the same person
who killed Jake.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.528
So, you believe
that you're being targeted
just like before?

21:16.540 --> 21:18.997
Yes.
You, um...

21:19.000 --> 21:21.264
Went away for a while
for treatment. PTSD.

21:21.270 --> 21:26.879
Yeah, I had some stress issues
that I had to deal with after...

21:26.880 --> 21:30.145
After what happened
on the dock. Huh.

21:30.150 --> 21:32.118
And you were admitted
to the psych ward

21:32.120 --> 21:35.908
after witnessing the death
of your ex-boyfriend last year.

21:36.890 --> 21:39.279
Okay, look,
i know this sounds crazy.

21:39.290 --> 21:41.884
That's why I didn't
come to you right away.
I was scared.

21:41.890 --> 21:43.426
I-i didn't know
how to explain this.

21:43.430 --> 21:46.558
But, after what happened
to Jake...

21:46.570 --> 21:49.095
You have to believe me.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.596
I believe you.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.867
I mean, I believe you believe
what you're saying to be true.

21:59.510 --> 22:02.047
So, that's it?
If what you're saying is true,

22:02.050 --> 22:05.213
you're the victim here,
you're not one of the bad guys.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.642
So, for now, that's it.

22:06.650 --> 22:10.541
Please take Emma back
to the learning center.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.497
(Sighs)

22:21.330 --> 22:23.594
With all due respect, sheriff,
letting her off so easy

22:23.600 --> 22:26.467
and looking the other way
when it comes to a gun
on campus?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.165
You ever hear
of Stockholm syndrome?

22:28.170 --> 22:29.637
Keep them bottled up
long enough,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.631
act like the nice guy
in a bad situation,

22:31.640 --> 22:35.098
and, inevitably,
they come to your side.

22:35.610 --> 22:37.339
Jake Fitzgerald...

22:37.350 --> 22:39.614
Had some bad habits,
made some pretty strong enemies.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.440
One of them wanted
to kill this kid.

22:41.450 --> 22:44.954
You think it could be
one of the lakewood six?
It's the lakewood five now.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.349
And, sure, even that sweet girl
that just walked out of here

22:47.360 --> 22:49.089
could be a sociopath,
for all we know.

22:49.090 --> 22:51.251
But I'm not gonna
narrow it down to five people.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.354
Whoever it was,
they're probably not finished.

23:02.670 --> 23:07.004
So... I found Jake Fitzgerald,
just like you asked.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.706
That is not even
remotely funny.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.348
My daughter is coming
home with me, now.

23:12.350 --> 23:16.116
I fully understand your concern,
but I still need to ask her
a few questions.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.519
Not without me present.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.978
She might be more honest
if you're not in the room.

23:20.990 --> 23:22.457
Am I a suspect, Miguel?

23:22.460 --> 23:25.588
No. You'd never drop a body
in front of your daughter.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.366
A freezer in the garage...
Now, that's more your style.

23:31.270 --> 23:32.999
He's a good guy
and a decent cop...

23:33.010 --> 23:35.035
Oh, my god. Whatever!
Okay, now, he thinks I'm crazy.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.259
He went straight to asking me
about PTSD and the psych ward.

23:38.280 --> 23:42.649
Look, in times like this,
you have to be careful
with who you trust.

23:42.650 --> 23:44.208
What?

23:44.220 --> 23:45.016
Hey!

23:45.020 --> 23:47.614
Whoa, we all need
to calm down. Hey!

23:49.190 --> 23:51.545
She had the dead guy's phone
and they just sent her back.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.313
Why? Because her mom
works for the police. Duh!

23:54.330 --> 23:56.548
Why are they all staring?
Ignore it.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.028
No, i-i want to know
what they have to say.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.624
She's not worth it.
Emma, just...
stop it!

24:03.140 --> 24:04.425
Hey.

24:05.540 --> 24:08.168
Do you have something
you want to say to me?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.133
Look, I know that you're scared.
We are all scared.

24:11.140 --> 24:15.406
But we should not be scared
of each other, okay?
Please do not be scared of me.

24:15.410 --> 24:18.413
But I am scared of you.
Everyone who comes
around you dies.

24:18.420 --> 24:22.481
And your friends
should be scared, too,
because they're all gonna die.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.248
You have no idea
what I went through.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.182
You went through?
Piper butchered eight people,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.054
but magically didn't touch
a hair on your head.

24:32.060 --> 24:34.051
That is not true.
Then, you shot her
in the face,

24:34.070 --> 24:36.368
so we only got
your side of the story.
Audrey: That's enough, Hayley.

24:36.370 --> 24:39.168
Leave her alone.
Her whole family is crazy,
aren't they?

24:39.170 --> 24:40.592
Anytime there's
a killer loose, somehow,

24:40.610 --> 24:43.408
there's always
a crazy duval left standing!

24:43.740 --> 24:46.402
(Students gasping)

24:57.920 --> 24:59.251
You dumb bitch!

24:59.260 --> 25:03.026
(Students yelling)

25:03.030 --> 25:05.055
Hey, get off her!

25:05.060 --> 25:06.425
Get off!

25:07.070 --> 25:11.291
Man: Hey, hey, break it up!
Woman: Break it up!
Leave her alone!

25:11.940 --> 25:13.589
Are you okay?

25:13.610 --> 25:17.205
Come on, let's get you
out of here. Come on.

25:17.210 --> 25:19.303
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.949
Move. Out of the way.
Okay, guys, back it up.

25:21.950 --> 25:23.201
All right. Okay.
You okay?

25:23.220 --> 25:26.974
So, when was the last time
you saw Jake?

25:26.990 --> 25:28.685
Sunday night.

25:29.350 --> 25:31.318
Here at the pool.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.278
We snuck in to have sex.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.349
Okay, um, so...
(Chuckles)

25:38.360 --> 25:43.297
Trespassing. But I get it.
It's... it's fun, right? Right?

25:43.300 --> 25:47.532
Anything else you want
to tell me about that night?

25:47.540 --> 25:50.634
We had a fight.
About...?

25:52.040 --> 25:57.546
My father. He had
a problem with Jake.

25:58.220 --> 26:02.145
Jake wanted to go public
about us, but I...

26:04.590 --> 26:06.455
I chose my dad.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.022
Look, I know who did this.

26:11.160 --> 26:16.166
Seth Branson,
my former... teacher.

26:16.170 --> 26:20.595
He's been sending me texts,
flowers, showing up everywhere...

26:20.610 --> 26:25.138
Sweetheart, you never...
There is a restraining order.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.404
He was stalking you?

26:27.410 --> 26:29.002
We used to call it
something else,

26:29.010 --> 26:30.978
but, yeah,
he's been stalking me.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.538
And you think he's capable?

26:32.550 --> 26:34.211
Why would he do
something like this?

26:34.220 --> 26:37.348
I think he did this
because of me.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.159
I want to go see Jake.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.297
Alone.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.320
(Hyperventilating)

26:51.340 --> 26:54.138
I can't believe I hit her.
I've never done anything
like that before.

26:54.140 --> 26:58.429
Just breathe.
You're experiencing
multiple PTSD triggers:

26:58.440 --> 26:59.600
Grief, anxiety, fear...

26:59.610 --> 27:02.147
Heightening your
fight-or-flight response.

27:02.150 --> 27:03.606
Okay.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.316
I'm... I'm shaking.
That's the adrenaline.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.585
It's gonna take a second
to work through your body.
What you need to do is rest.

27:09.590 --> 27:13.549
Here. I'm gonna check back
at the learning center.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.279
Stay here. Relax.

27:16.290 --> 27:17.723
Okay.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.095
Ms. lang?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.728
I..._I don't want this
to drive me crazy again.

27:21.730 --> 27:24.597
Something terrible
just happened to somebody
that you cared about.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.331
It's bringing up
a lot of emotions.
That's not crazy, Emma.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.103
That's normal.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.456
(Breathing heavily)

27:51.230 --> 27:52.720
He's obsessed
with the lakewood six.

27:52.730 --> 27:55.494
He was the one handing out
the doped-up shots last night.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.388
He's drawing our friends
being brutally murdered.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.460
Now, hello,
one of our friends has
been brutally murdered!

28:00.470 --> 28:02.609
I'm telling you
it's not stavo, okay?

28:02.610 --> 28:05.135
He's one of us...
A horror fan, a friend.

28:05.140 --> 28:08.769
And if you're right
and I'm wrong,
i will apologize.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.544
But, if I'm right,
what are you gonna say

28:11.550 --> 28:13.541
when I'm the one
hanging from a banner

28:13.550 --> 28:16.348
with my insides
on the outside?

28:16.350 --> 28:18.409
(Scoffs)

28:22.760 --> 28:24.682
Dude, the emergency door
is disarmed.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.429
If you can sneak
into the service hallway,

28:26.430 --> 28:29.160
you can get back in
without being caught.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.569
(Sighs)

28:53.330 --> 28:55.890
He was really beautiful.

28:55.890 --> 28:57.528
You scared me.

28:59.630 --> 29:03.191
How long has he been
like this?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.261
I can't comment
on an open case

29:05.270 --> 29:06.897
and these are just
initial findings.

29:06.910 --> 29:10.209
Maggie! Please.

29:10.210 --> 29:11.802
I need to know.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.905
I'd say two or three days.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.710
It's impossible.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.883
No! He couldn't! He...

29:36.230 --> 29:38.767
(Metal scraping)

29:56.220 --> 29:58.950
(Phone ringing)

30:05.900 --> 30:08.892
(Suspenseful music playing)

30:11.800 --> 30:16.908
Hello?
Distorted voice:
He/io, Emma. Did you miss me?

30:16.910 --> 30:19.708
Well, I’m coming for you!

30:19.710 --> 30:21.803
(Suspenseful music playing)

30:28.520 --> 30:30.886
(Banging)

30:30.890 --> 30:34.519
(Metal scraping)

30:49.370 --> 30:52.430
(Grunts)
Not this time!

31:15.330 --> 31:19.460
I am not gonna play
your games anymore!

31:22.740 --> 31:28.474
I know you, Maggie.
You hide it well,
but you're an emotional person.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.471
This must be hard for you.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.947
I'm okay.

31:31.950 --> 31:34.669
I'm removing you
from this case.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.742
What?
I saw you reveal
privileged information

31:38.760 --> 31:40.489
that could compromise
this investigation.

31:40.490 --> 31:42.629
That was Brooke. The girl
just lost her boyfriend.

31:42.630 --> 31:47.294
You see that girl and you see
your daughter's friend.
You should see a suspect.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.895
That girl was, as far
as I can tell, the last person
to see the victim alive.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.595
They had an argument
alone in this building,

31:52.600 --> 31:55.933
and, a few days later,
his body drops from
a banner above her head.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.965
The girl is clearly
being victimized.

31:57.980 --> 32:01.575
And you're too close
to this by a mile.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.743
You're just gonna have
to sit this one out.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.718
Are you serious, Miguel?

32:07.390 --> 32:09.711
Dwayne'll get your notes
on the way out of the building.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.312
You're having me
escorted out?

32:11.320 --> 32:13.254
I'm sorry, Maggie.
I don't want to make you

32:13.260 --> 32:15.751
choose between being a mother
and a medical examiner.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.389
So, yeah, I'm having you
removed from the scene.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.228
(Sighs)

32:27.740 --> 32:29.298
(Sighs)

32:57.800 --> 33:01.338
Audrey!
Dude, you scared
the crap out of me!

33:01.340 --> 33:02.602
I'm sorry.

33:02.610 --> 33:04.737
You okay? I was out there
and you were in here

33:04.740 --> 33:07.709
and itjust...
it felt weird.
What do you mean?

33:07.710 --> 33:10.577
We're always together
in times of intense peril,

33:10.580 --> 33:13.913
and, I don't know,
H was worried about you.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.811
Oh. Thanks. Anyway,
I've been watching stavo.
Stavo? I'm telling you...

33:17.820 --> 33:20.983
And I'm telling you
this guy could be
seriously messed up, Noah.

33:20.990 --> 33:25.450
We barely know the kid.
I'm sorry he doesn't fit
your accomplice profile,

33:25.460 --> 33:27.997
but he's got the same
twisted sense of humor

33:28.000 --> 33:30.889
as the freak
that's been calling me.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.458
You've been getting calls?

33:32.470 --> 33:35.962
I'm talking about the texts,
the ones I showed you, the ones
i got when Emma got back.

33:35.970 --> 33:39.701
You said "calls."
Plus, didn't you think
they were just pranks?

33:39.710 --> 33:42.599
I meant texts, Noah,
and I don't know what they are.

33:42.610 --> 33:47.547
Whatever! Stavo basically
has "crazy psychopath"
tattooed on his forehead,

33:47.550 --> 33:49.086
and I'm supposed
to just ignore it?

33:49.090 --> 33:50.910
I can't. No, not under
these circumstances.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.354
People are dying.
People? It's just one so far.

33:53.360 --> 33:57.478
You're... you're my favorite
person in the world,
but you're acting weird.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.752
We're all freaking out
about Jake right now,
i get it,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.524
but, trust me, you really
need to take a breath.

34:02.530 --> 34:05.897
Piper was right under
our noses and nobody saw it.
Neither of us.

34:05.900 --> 34:09.631
So, what? You're just gonna
go over there and accuse him
of being a psycho killer?

34:09.640 --> 34:12.063
He's been sketching us,
Noah. All of us!

34:12.080 --> 34:15.743
Today, I saw him
drawing Kieran and Eli
in a pool of blood.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.968
Today, he was doing that!
Wow. Of all days.

34:17.980 --> 34:20.847
Yeah, I know!
It's... (Sighs)

34:20.850 --> 34:23.648
I'm just gonna ask him what
that's all about. That's it.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.981
It's not weird.
It'd be weird if we didn't.

34:25.990 --> 34:27.912
You, stavo!
What are you drawing?

34:27.930 --> 34:29.056
Don't worry about it.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.925
Come on, you're staring
at us all the time.

34:30.930 --> 34:32.921
I'd love to see
what we inspire in you.

34:32.930 --> 34:35.660
Hey! Give that back!
What the hell
is wrong with you?

34:35.670 --> 34:40.095
What is she doing?
She was just gonna ask him
what he was drawing.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.131
Give it back! It's not...
Look, it's not...

34:43.140 --> 34:46.576
What is it not?
You want me to show everybody
what you think it's not?

34:46.580 --> 34:50.072
(Students murmuring)
This is what he's drawing!

34:50.080 --> 34:51.399
Oh, my god. You sicko!

34:51.420 --> 34:53.149
They're just drawings!
So, just give it back...

34:53.150 --> 34:58.144
(students murmuring)
You know what? It looks
like it's more! A lot more!

34:58.160 --> 35:00.048
It's not what you think!
It's not what you think!

35:00.060 --> 35:01.812
You know who does that?
Serial killers!

35:01.830 --> 35:05.550
_A||: Yeah! _
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

35:05.560 --> 35:09.929
Boy: That's messed up, man!
(All gasping, murmuring)

35:09.930 --> 35:14.492
Boy: That's gross!
It's just... it's just
a comic book, all right?

35:14.510 --> 35:16.102
It's a fantasy.
It's not real life.

35:16.110 --> 35:19.170
Liar!
No, no, no!
Careful with that!

35:19.180 --> 35:20.636
(Students gasping)

35:20.650 --> 35:22.845
Girl:
That is not all right!

35:24.920 --> 35:28.014
(Students shouting, cheering)

35:35.130 --> 35:38.657
Sheriff, we've got
a big situation!

35:38.660 --> 35:40.059
(All yelling)

35:40.060 --> 35:42.051
What did you do?

35:42.070 --> 35:45.096
What is wrong
with you all? Get back!

35:45.640 --> 35:47.596
Break it up! Break it up!

35:47.610 --> 35:51.899
Break it up! Break up!
Back off! Back off!

36:04.620 --> 36:05.484
Emma?

36:05.490 --> 36:09.017
(Suspenseful music playing)

36:32.880 --> 36:36.782
Woma n :
throw me down

36:36.790 --> 36:39.554
I’ll steal the moon

36:39.990 --> 36:41.855
I’ll tear the night . .

36:41.860 --> 36:43.987
Emma, we know how hard
this day has been,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.821
and the sheriff and i
are a little concerned

36:46.830 --> 36:48.525
about your emotional
and mental state.

36:48.530 --> 36:52.830
I appreciate that.
You want to tell us
what happened?

36:54.510 --> 36:55.738
I had a panic attack.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.208
Panic? You threw a chair
through a window.

36:58.210 --> 37:01.577
Well, when I realized
that I was locked in that room,

37:01.580 --> 37:03.070
I just... I lost it.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.039
The adrenaline
must've heightened
my fight-or-flight response.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.039
Right, Ms. lang?

37:08.050 --> 37:09.813
I just wanted
to make sure she was safe.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.709
Oh, of course.
You probably should
have stayed with her.

37:12.720 --> 37:16.656
Anything else
you want to tell us
about what happened, Emma?

37:18.530 --> 37:20.828
No, sheriff, that's it.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.894
Okay. You're free to go.

37:30.210 --> 37:33.202
Hey! You okay?

37:33.210 --> 37:35.178
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.699
I'm sorry.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.841
I'm sorry I...
I told him about the phone.

37:44.860 --> 37:48.910
Uh, yeah, I guess you thought
that was the best way
to handle it?

37:48.930 --> 37:52.024
But Audrey's right.
Someone's messing with us,
and our choices matter,

37:52.030 --> 37:56.763
and I would like to think
that you trust me enough
to make my own.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.522
Of course I do.

38:00.300 --> 38:02.234
Can I take you home?

38:03.140 --> 38:07.702
No, I thinkI need to be
alone for a little bit,
if that's okay.

38:07.710 --> 38:10.304
Are you the one for me?

38:10.310 --> 38:14.110
time Is wasted and...

38:14.120 --> 38:18.238
I’m not losing sleep

38:18.260 --> 38:21.718
don ’t just stand and stare

38:21.730 --> 38:25.188
come on
and bare your teeth

38:25.200 --> 38:28.590
I could take you there

38:28.600 --> 38:32.866
if you let me see

38:32.870 --> 38:34.861
why you are the one

38:34.870 --> 38:36.701
I'm gonna go say something.

38:36.710 --> 38:40.009
Are you the one for me?

38:40.010 --> 38:43.741
time Is wasted and...

38:43.750 --> 38:47.140
I’m not losing sleep

38:47.150 --> 38:52.110
don ’t just stand
and stare...

38:52.120 --> 38:55.214
I'll pay to fix it...
Or replace it.

38:55.230 --> 38:57.289
Stay the hell away
from me...

38:57.300 --> 38:59.222
Or I'll break
something you love.

38:59.230 --> 39:02.324
Come on
and bare your teeth

39:02.330 --> 39:05.788
come on
and bare your teeth

39:05.800 --> 39:07.358
come on
and bare your teeth

39:07.370 --> 39:11.636
that went a little bit
more
lord of the flies
than I expected.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.335
The whole day.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.205
What? I'm kidding.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.943
Come on
and bare your teeth

39:20.950 --> 39:22.781
come on
and bare your teeth

39:22.790 --> 39:26.351
you ’Ve seen me bare

39:26.360 --> 39:29.955
you ’Ve seen me covered up

39:29.960 --> 39:34.056
maybe I ’m not scared

39:34.070 --> 39:37.790
what you ’re th/nk/ng of

39:37.800 --> 39:41.236
you ’Ve seen me here

39:41.240 --> 39:44.209
and held me m/les away

39:44.210 --> 39:52.640
underneath my skin
Is all you 7/ see today

39:58.020 --> 40:00.659
(suspenseful music playing)

40:30.190 --> 40:34.115
(Suspenseful music playing)
