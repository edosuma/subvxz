I ain't gonna lie,
you in your bag, LD.

01:21.573 --> 01:22.709
This has been, what,
the most productive month

01:22.709 --> 01:24.211
of my life?
I own a home.

01:24.211 --> 01:25.581
- (Gata whoops)
- What more can I ask for?

01:25.581 --> 01:27.184
You speaking your truth
into existence.

01:27.184 --> 01:28.186
- Thank you.
- Yeah, Chuck. Really speaking

01:28.186 --> 01:29.556
your truth into existence.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.725
Especially when you're lying
to everyone

01:30.725 --> 01:32.127
on national television.

01:32.127 --> 01:33.330
DAVE:
What are you referring to?

01:33.330 --> 01:34.833
Jimmy Kimmel?

01:34.833 --> 01:36.269
I didn't lie on Jimmy Kimmel,
you can go replay

01:36.269 --> 01:37.505
all that footage,
I didn't lie once.

01:37.505 --> 01:38.608
He just twisted facts.

01:38.608 --> 01:40.177
I didn't twist any facts.

01:40.177 --> 01:41.614
- I didn't.
- Chuck, you sound like Trump.

01:41.614 --> 01:43.584
I omitted, like, some details,
but he didn't ask

01:43.584 --> 01:44.820
the questions that would've...

01:44.820 --> 01:46.690
- (laughing)
- I really did, like,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.561
learn a lot about life
from that whole experience.

01:48.561 --> 01:50.565
And I have a whole new lens
that I see the world through.

01:50.565 --> 01:52.769
From here on out, honesty.

01:52.769 --> 01:55.875
On that note, earlier today,
I did tell you that a boner

01:55.875 --> 01:58.313
was called a boner because a man
has a bone that, like,

01:58.313 --> 01:59.549
comes out of his pelvis
when he's excited.

01:59.549 --> 02:00.818
It's not true.

02:00.818 --> 02:02.522
Dick isn't made of bones.
It's, like,

02:02.522 --> 02:04.826
- all meat.
- Oh. Okay.

02:04.826 --> 02:06.262
All right, I need you guys
to leave.

02:06.262 --> 02:07.599
I'm getting ready for Robyn.

02:07.599 --> 02:08.901
Chuck, how long is
she gonna stay here?

02:08.901 --> 02:11.272
I don't know, two weeks.

02:11.272 --> 02:12.308
- Two weeks?!
- Yeah.

02:12.308 --> 02:13.611
Are you insane?

02:13.611 --> 02:15.247
Two weeks, it's
like a honeymoon length.

02:15.247 --> 02:16.784
I couldn't be more excited, honestly.

02:16.784 --> 02:19.221
What if she's not even
what you remember her to be?

02:19.221 --> 02:20.825
You barely know this girl.

02:20.825 --> 02:23.263
Man, that shit happened to me
one time, I was fucking

02:23.263 --> 02:24.365
with this Arabian bitch, man.

02:24.365 --> 02:26.202
I thought she was gonna be cool.

02:26.202 --> 02:27.939
But she gonna text me the next
day talking about alimony.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.177
How you get pregnant in one day?

02:30.177 --> 02:32.281
Gata, I have no idea what
you're talking about,

02:32.281 --> 02:33.718
but this is not that.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.755
I, like, know this girl.
I talk to her, we text.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.291
If you heard the voice mail
she left when she thought

02:37.291 --> 02:38.928
I was dead,
you would understand.

02:38.928 --> 02:40.631
So you talk to her about
everything, right?

02:40.631 --> 02:41.700
She know about the death scam
and all that, huh?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.771
Never call it the death scam.

02:43.771 --> 02:46.275
Right? Let's refer
to the death...

02:46.275 --> 02:48.714
thing as a totally
different thing

02:48.714 --> 02:50.551
that never even is vocalized.

02:50.551 --> 02:52.388
And, uh, no, I have not,

02:52.388 --> 02:54.593
but, like, I will. I just,
like, don't want to start off

02:54.593 --> 02:56.195
with that conversation, but...

02:56.195 --> 02:58.199
I'm getting to a fresh
new start too, man.

02:58.199 --> 02:59.435
You ain't gonna
believe this, nigga.

02:59.435 --> 03:00.772
I ain't had sex in,
like, two weeks.

03:00.772 --> 03:02.307
You know?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.711
I even started beating
my shit again.

03:03.711 --> 03:05.848
Beating your shit?
What, like jerking off?

03:05.848 --> 03:07.552
GATA:
Yeah, jacking off, dawg.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.321
What? You weren't
jerking off before?

03:09.321 --> 03:11.392
I ain't jerked off since, like,
12th grade or some shit.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.329
12th grade? You haven't
jerked off in, like,

03:13.329 --> 03:14.432
- 20 years?
- That's insane.

03:14.432 --> 03:16.436
It's way too many hoes out here

03:16.436 --> 03:18.507
for a nigga to just be
jacking off like that, bro.

03:18.507 --> 03:20.545
Whoa, whoa, whoa, please be
careful about the roses

03:20.545 --> 03:21.880
on the way out.
They're perfectly...

03:21.880 --> 03:24.519
Chuck. Chuck, this is crazy.

03:24.519 --> 03:25.988
You're gonna freak
this girl out.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.293
Unless you want her to be
your actual girlfriend,

03:28.293 --> 03:29.696
- and then I think
it's gonna freak you out.
- (doorbell rings)

03:29.696 --> 03:31.365
Chuck, it's finally the point

03:31.365 --> 03:32.769
in your life where you,
like, ju--

03:32.769 --> 03:34.906
What are you doing?
You could just be like...

03:34.906 --> 03:36.275
- Hello?
- MAN: It's Amazon.

03:36.275 --> 03:37.512

03:37.512 --> 03:38.948
Okay, coming right up.

03:38.948 --> 03:40.350

03:40.350 --> 03:41.352
- Is it open?
- (lock buzzes)

03:41.352 --> 03:42.689
Thank you.

I'm gonna have to cancel
the beach thing tomorrow.

03:47.599 --> 03:49.503
No, no, no, Chuck,
you can't cancel it.

03:49.503 --> 03:51.840
The beach is, like, overrated
and one-dimensionally textured

03:51.840 --> 03:53.511
anyways. Like, I have to...

03:53.511 --> 03:54.913
Bro, you gotta come
to the beach, dawg.

03:54.913 --> 03:56.917
You out of pocket,
you doing way too much.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.721
- All these roses and shit?
- Guys, I will see you later.

03:58.721 --> 04:00.758
- Okay?
- What, you're just
canceling plans on us?

04:00.758 --> 04:02.562
I can't neglect her
on the first day.

There is a store.

- We can go there.

06:24.478 --> 06:26.182
- I'll... Okay.
- I'm gonna get weed for myself.

06:26.182 --> 06:27.752
You have the wine. We'll escape
our bodies at the same time.

I think we've got a lot done.

06:36.068 --> 06:37.104

Mm. Honest-- well, that's after
he faked his own death?

07:07.932 --> 07:09.803
We just, we just want
to get away from that...

07:09.803 --> 07:11.205
- Mm.
- That thing, you know?

07:11.205 --> 07:12.909
It's a-- yech-- story.
It's a yucky story.

07:12.909 --> 07:14.679
- Right.
- And Dave's very sensitive
about it.

07:14.679 --> 07:15.815
You know I love Dave. Right?

07:15.815 --> 07:17.084
- Yeah.
- And I love a challenge.

07:17.084 --> 07:19.188
I love you guys.
That's why I took you on.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.058
But your client is a child.

07:21.058 --> 07:24.766
I mean, last time he was here
he was playing with putty.

07:24.766 --> 07:26.469
That's for his ADD.
That's actually not Silly Putty.

07:26.469 --> 07:27.772
That's prescribed.

07:27.772 --> 07:29.041
Okay, but it stuck
his pocket closed.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.210
And he couldn't open it.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.847
- Yeah.
- Just, we have to be able

07:31.847 --> 07:33.617
to control him and, you know,
not let him...

07:33.617 --> 07:35.487
I can't control Dave, Ava.

07:35.487 --> 07:39.929
I can't control anything
in my life. Y-- He's...

07:39.929 --> 07:41.165
I...

07:41.165 --> 07:42.635
(inhales sharply)

07:42.635 --> 07:45.473
But you have me now, Mike. Okay?

07:46.910 --> 07:48.914
We're gonna do this together.

07:50.885 --> 07:51.987
Great.

07:53.657 --> 07:55.093
Great.

07:55.928 --> 07:57.732
I think
I'd like to get coffee
with you sometime,

07:57.732 --> 07:59.502
outside of-- or, I mean,
we would do business,

07:59.502 --> 08:01.540
but I mean, outside of
this office 'cause I don't...

08:01.540 --> 08:02.942

- Oh, you know what?
I have another meeting.

08:02.942 --> 08:05.113
Sorry. Our conversation
was great, though.

08:05.113 --> 08:06.883
- Awesome. Loved it.
- It was very productive.

08:06.883 --> 08:08.186
- And I will...
- Let me get out of here.

08:08.186 --> 08:10.725
- ...be in touch. Okay.
- Thank you.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.164
I'm actually free tonight.

08:14.164 --> 08:15.835
For coffee?

08:15.835 --> 08:18.106
So why don't you come on by
and annihilate me?

08:19.943 --> 08:21.747
What?

08:21.747 --> 08:23.650
Not actually, obviously.

08:23.650 --> 08:25.521
But I'm just into role-playing
and blurring lines

08:25.521 --> 08:27.692
between consensual
and non-consensual.

08:27.692 --> 08:29.294
So, um...

08:48.767 --> 08:50.170
Can't believe yo

08:50.170 --> 08:51.773
It's your own personal holiday.
I love holidays.

08:51.773 --> 08:54.178
I just feel like every year
that gets higher,

08:54.178 --> 08:56.248
the number is more
and more alarming,

08:56.248 --> 08:57.852
and all I do is think
about, like, my place

08:57.852 --> 08:59.856
in the world, and, like,
my-my standing.

08:59.856 --> 09:02.729
No, man, you got to stay
in the present, dawg.

09:02.729 --> 09:05.066
- (laughs) Yeah.
- I like the present
right now, dawg.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.072
Yeah. On my 21st birthday,
we were doing karaoke,

09:08.072 --> 09:12.648
and I was just, like, ripping
"All Star" by Smash Mouth,

09:12.648 --> 09:16.055
(voice fading): and I...
whipped my hair into a candle.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.761
And then, my friends were like,
"You're-you're on fire,"

09:18.761 --> 09:21.165
and I was like, "You're
goddamn right I'm on fire."

09:21.165 --> 09:23.604
And I-- I just was, on fire.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.808
And then I ended up in the ER.

09:25.808 --> 09:28.747

09:34.324 --> 09:36.061

- Just, like, take it

16:28.219 --> 16:30.323
- the fuck out of my hand, and...
- No, what do you mean? I...

16:30.323 --> 16:33.095
- Be a man. Just...
- Don't tell me to be a man.
I am being a man.

16:33.095 --> 16:34.565
- I'm just...
- Jesus Christ! Will you
just go with this?

16:34.565 --> 16:36.435
I don't want to go with it!

16:36.435 --> 16:40.176
I don't want to go with it.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay?

16:40.176 --> 16:41.679
Ava, I don't want to do this.
I've never done this before.

16:41.679 --> 16:43.349
I don't know what to do.

16:43.349 --> 16:46.021
I think you're smart
and you're beautiful.

16:46.021 --> 16:48.025
I just want to, like,
do something normal with you.

16:48.025 --> 16:49.427
Like-like eat a meal...

16:49.427 --> 16:51.064
Mike, I like you, too.

16:51.064 --> 16:53.670
Obviously. That's why
I invited you over here.

16:53.670 --> 16:57.611
(sighs) I am in control
all the fucking time.

16:57.611 --> 16:59.447
Okay? So, I just, like,

16:59.447 --> 17:02.453
want something different,
if you know what I mean.

17:02.453 --> 17:04.324
Like, I guess it's my kink.

17:05.293 --> 17:08.800
I
just thought maybe you might
have wanted a little

17:08.800 --> 17:10.737
control in your life.

17:10.737 --> 17:12.808
I understand.

17:12.808 --> 17:15.413
I didn't get it before,
but trust me, I get it.

17:15.413 --> 17:17.417
I've had some weird kinks
over the years.

17:17.417 --> 17:20.256
I used to be in love with women
with lopsided breasts.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.559
I was obsessed.

17:21.559 --> 17:23.395
Look, I...

17:23.395 --> 17:26.368
I'm not gonna do
what you want me to do.

17:27.370 --> 17:30.243
- Okay.
- Because...

17:30.243 --> 17:33.249
as interesting as it sounds
for you to get what you want,

17:33.249 --> 17:36.455
you're not getting any of it. Hmm.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.392
At all.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.597
You like the way I rub you?

17:40.597 --> 17:42.501
- Do you like that?
- Mm. I-- Yeah, I do.

17:42.501 --> 17:44.170
I don't care if you do
or you don't.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.707
- You understand?
- Yeah.

17:45.707 --> 17:49.147
Don't. I hope
you don't understand.

17:49.147 --> 17:51.786
Did you order a brick?

17:51.786 --> 17:53.857
Wait, a brick?
What do you mean?

17:53.857 --> 17:55.359
A brick cock.

17:55.359 --> 17:57.363
'Cause I'm about
to lay some brick.

17:57.363 --> 17:59.467
- You wanna come?
- Yes, please.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.839
Too bad.
Not on my watch.

18:01.839 --> 18:03.677
(pepper spray clatters on floor)

18:03.677 --> 18:05.814
(gasps)

18:09.454 --> 18:11.158
ROBYN:
Mom, he's very e

18:11.158 --> 18:14.130
I mean, you have to be
to pull off getting so high

18:14.130 --> 18:16.134
that I just had to put him
into bed.

18:16.134 --> 18:18.172
And then when he was asleep,
his ex-girlfriend came,

18:18.172 --> 18:20.276
'cause their-- his whole
friend group is throwing him

18:20.276 --> 18:22.313
this surprise party and...

18:22.313 --> 18:25.286
No. Mom, I don't know
who's prettier.

18:25.286 --> 18:26.556
It's, like, crazy. I...

18:26.556 --> 18:27.591
We're both equal...

18:27.591 --> 18:29.695
- Hi. I gotta go.
- Hi.

18:29.695 --> 18:31.833
Okay. Love you. Bye.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.435
- Oh, boy.
- Hi.

18:33.435 --> 18:34.839
What have I done?

18:34.839 --> 18:36.609
- Good morning. He is risen.
- Good morning.

18:36.609 --> 18:39.649
I rose. I fucked it all up.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.485
- No, you didn't.
- Wow.

18:41.485 --> 18:44.525
Did you get good rest?

18:44.525 --> 18:46.896
I mean-- that was--
I'm borderline H, still.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.167
- Okay.
- But...

18:49.167 --> 18:50.704
I want to make it up to you.

18:50.704 --> 18:52.708
And I've taken steps towards
making it up to you

18:52.708 --> 18:54.311
by creating the perfect
romantic plan.

18:54.311 --> 18:56.381
- Okay.
- For us. Today.

18:56.381 --> 18:58.620
Today? The whole day?

18:58.620 --> 19:00.857
The whole day, bucko.
So strap in.

19:00.857 --> 19:05.500
Um... well, I-I made plans
for us today, too.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.769
- Dueling plans?
- Yeah.

19:06.769 --> 19:08.205
Okay. Tit for tat.

19:08.205 --> 19:09.407
What's yours?

19:09.407 --> 19:10.744
- What's yours?
- No, you first.

19:10.744 --> 19:12.781
- Okay. Let me paint a picture.
- Okay.

19:12.781 --> 19:14.752
I want you to imagine
that outside,

19:14.752 --> 19:16.254
even though we're
in Los Angeles,

19:16.254 --> 19:17.891
there are six to nine
inches of snow.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.864
How? Because I've created
an entire winter wonderland

19:20.864 --> 19:22.601
right here in my back area.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.939
Hot chocolate, toboggins,

19:24.939 --> 19:27.477
uh, there's like all types
of accoutrement

19:27.477 --> 19:28.947
that fits the winter
wonderland theme,

19:28.947 --> 19:30.650
because I remember that
you love snow days.

19:30.650 --> 19:31.886
- Snow days.
- Yeah.

19:31.886 --> 19:32.921
- So, we...
- That's...

19:32.921 --> 19:34.492
What's your plan?

19:35.527 --> 19:37.363
The beach.

19:37.363 --> 19:38.533
- Just the beach?
- Yeah.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.802
- Oh.
- Yeah.

19:39.802 --> 19:41.304
- Why does everyone...
- The beach.

19:41.304 --> 19:42.574
- We can...
- Everyone loves the beach.

19:42.574 --> 19:43.910
- I don't...
- We could just go, relax,

19:43.910 --> 19:44.912
and chill on the beach,
and we could

19:44.912 --> 19:47.383
just, you know, get comfortable.

19:47.383 --> 19:48.953
- Sit around.
- And go for a swim and get tan.

19:48.953 --> 19:51.324
It's so cold in there.
I can't tan. I'm on Accutane.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.761
- But...
- I rented bikes.

19:52.761 --> 19:54.498
So we can get exercise.
Do you not like...?

19:54.498 --> 19:55.934
Bikes are...

19:55.934 --> 19:57.236
Feels like you...

19:57.236 --> 19:58.573
If I seem forlorn,

19:58.573 --> 20:00.309
it's 'cause I just don't
know how to ride a bike.

20:00.309 --> 20:01.679
- You can't ride a bike?
- I struggle riding a bike.

20:01.679 --> 20:03.382
And it was a big thing
of my childhood,

20:03.382 --> 20:04.785
all my friends could
ride the bike,

20:04.785 --> 20:06.656
I couldn't do it.
It really separated me from

20:06.656 --> 20:08.292
my entire group of friends
and it's like...

20:08.292 --> 20:10.530
But life is about learning
new things, it's...

20:10.530 --> 20:11.699
Is it?

20:11.699 --> 20:13.870
No snow day?

20:13.870 --> 20:17.009
I-I would just really love
to get out of the house.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.479
You know? The, like...

20:18.479 --> 20:19.815
- Oh, yeah.
- We should...

20:19.815 --> 20:21.318
Yeah. What am I...?

20:21.318 --> 20:22.588
Stretch my legs.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.857
Yeah, so I didn't even
think about that

20:23.857 --> 20:25.527
you would never want
to stay here,

20:25.527 --> 20:26.461
because you've been here for--
I didn't even--

20:26.461 --> 20:27.931
Let me, uh-- I can adapt.

20:27.931 --> 20:29.401
I can adapt. I'll just
call the whole thing off.

20:29.401 --> 20:31.806
- Okay.
- One sec. Hey, fellas, uh...

20:31.806 --> 20:33.475
(knocking on glass)

20:33.475 --> 20:35.312
No, we don't need any more.

20:35.312 --> 20:36.849
Ix-nay on the ow-snay.

20:36.849 --> 20:40.590
- This is so thoughtful.
- It's okay.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.961
I think I might be in the window
of cancellation.

20:42.961 --> 20:44.431
I doubt it, though.
They are here.

20:44.431 --> 20:46.001
But it's not that costly.

20:46.001 --> 20:47.638
This is very sweet.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.575
You-- you're sweet.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.612
Throwing me on that bike
is sweet.

20:51.612 --> 20:53.683
- We're gonna do this.
- Yeah.

20:56.087 --> 20:57.490
(sighs)

20:57.490 --> 21:00.262
♪ ♪

21:01.331 --> 21:02.501
(mouths)

21:02.501 --> 21:04.304
(distant waves crashing)

21:04.304 --> 21:06.441
BENNY:
You gotta put it somewhere
he can see it.

21:06.441 --> 21:09.515
All right, yeah,
just this way a little.

21:09.515 --> 21:11.886
No, that way.

21:11.886 --> 21:14.324
Just-- I'm gonna go-- I'm gonna
change it myself later.

21:14.324 --> 21:16.461
Oh, honey, I would have never
done this at the beach.

21:16.461 --> 21:18.600
It's dirty and overrated. It's
like trying to throw a party

21:18.600 --> 21:20.937
in the wilderness,
and it smells so bad!

21:20.937 --> 21:23.375
Yeah, what do you expect? Look.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.045
- There's a fucking dead seal
here. What am I supposed to do?
- (flies buzzing)

21:25.045 --> 21:27.483
CAROL:
Well, it's the beach.
What did you expect?

21:27.483 --> 21:30.055
Expect? I didn't expect there
to be a fucking dead seal.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.926
I've never even seen
a real seal.

21:31.926 --> 21:33.863
What do we do?
Do we, like, change the time?

21:33.863 --> 21:36.001
- Do we let the tide come in?
- Nah, man.

21:36.001 --> 21:38.005
It's fine. All we gotta do is
get that dead-ass seal

21:38.005 --> 21:39.508
in the ocean.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.344
Look, let's just go down there,

21:41.344 --> 21:43.015
we pick it up-- the three
of us could get it out of here

21:43.015 --> 21:44.652
in like five minutes.

21:44.652 --> 21:46.823
Hell nah, bro.
That shit look diseased, man...

21:46.823 --> 21:49.394
Can I, can I help?
What's the task?

21:49.394 --> 21:50.697
- It's down there.
- Oh, Jesus.

21:50.697 --> 21:52.801
- Fuck no. Fuck.
- ALLY: I'm here!

21:52.801 --> 21:54.772
What is the catastrophe?
Oh, God.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.943
(whistling)
Birds! Come on, eat the...

21:56.943 --> 21:58.980
Just eat the dead seal
down there!

21:58.980 --> 22:00.517
I gotta get my assistant
to deal with this.

22:00.517 --> 22:02.420
She does shit like this
all the time.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.723
Oh, my God.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.560
Y'all like the sea?

22:05.560 --> 22:08.500
Uh, not-- No, not really.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.802
(phone buzzing)

22:14.845 --> 22:16.983
Wow, you really
weren't exaggerating.

22:16.983 --> 22:19.788
No. I mean, yeah.

22:19.788 --> 22:22.393
It's the starting and stopping
and turning that I'm...

22:22.393 --> 22:24.430
- Just commit to it.
- Commit?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.667
I'm pretty committed right now.

22:25.667 --> 22:28.005
What do I--?
There's a car!

22:28.005 --> 22:30.677
Hey, there's a car, Robyn. What
do I do? I'm not leaving this

22:30.677 --> 22:32.446
- to human error.
- Go to the sidewalk.
Go to the sidewalk.

22:32.446 --> 22:33.816
Ah!

22:33.816 --> 22:34.952
(sighs)

22:34.952 --> 22:36.622
I like the sidewalk.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.458
You know, until now,
I would've thought you could

22:38.458 --> 22:40.396
either ride a bike or not,
I've never actually seen

22:40.396 --> 22:42.568
- this middle ground.
It's pretty impressive.
- Well...

22:42.568 --> 22:44.070
- You're doing great.
- This is nice.

22:44.070 --> 22:45.574
- Uh...
- Really...

22:45.574 --> 22:47.711
- DAVE: Uh, sir!
- ROBYN: Okay.

22:47.711 --> 22:49.615
- Ho-- Homeless man!
- ROBYN: Dave, just breathe.
- (bell dinging)

22:49.615 --> 22:51.586
- Dave, just-just go around him.
- I can't turn. I can't turn.

22:51.586 --> 22:52.688
- Just turn around him. Dave!
- Sir, I can't turn.

22:52.688 --> 22:53.823
- Sir-- Ah!
- Dave!

22:53.823 --> 22:55.459
- (yells) Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.430
- Are you-- Did you...?
- DAVE: Ah, goddamn it!

22:57.430 --> 22:59.033
- You okay?
- No.

22:59.033 --> 23:00.971
- (groans) My knee.
- Ah, how's your knee?

23:00.971 --> 23:02.106
- Not good.
- Okay, well...

23:02.106 --> 23:03.442
I'm, like, fully skinned, so...

23:03.442 --> 23:05.446
(exhales forcefully)
Okay.

23:05.446 --> 23:06.749
We tried.

23:06.749 --> 23:08.886
I gave it my all.
Today is not our day.

23:08.886 --> 23:10.590
Let's go home.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.426
- (phone buzzing)
- This isn't working.

23:12.426 --> 23:14.899
You know what
is the most healing?

23:14.899 --> 23:17.036
- (Dave groans)
- The salt a-and...

23:17.036 --> 23:18.606
the sun.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.442
I'm just gonna be totally
frank with you.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.979
There is a zero percent chance
I'm going to the beach.

23:21.979 --> 23:23.850
Okay, but we had planned
to go to the beach.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.720
I don't know, plans, like,
change, like...

23:25.720 --> 23:27.591
Blockbuster had plans to not
have the streaming era exist.

23:27.591 --> 23:29.460
Come on. Let's...
Let's just, like, see...

23:29.460 --> 23:31.464
- Yeah, you can get up.
- (groans) No, it hurts.

23:31.464 --> 23:32.868
So we can get these in,
like, an Uber.

23:32.868 --> 23:35.640
No. I'm-I'm hurt.
I can't put any weight on it.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.143
But we had plans
to go to the beach.

23:38.178 --> 23:41.619
Robyn... it's not happening.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.556
- I'm trying to put on...
- That's...

23:43.556 --> 23:45.025
- (phone buzzing)
- That's what?
- I...

23:45.025 --> 23:46.762
This is no indictment on you.
I fell.

23:46.762 --> 23:48.499
- I tried to ride a bike.
- No, it's just-- Come on.

23:48.499 --> 23:50.035
- I'm skinned.
I'm a skinned person.
- Yeah.

23:50.035 --> 23:51.806
I came all the way
from Wisconsin, Dave.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.145
I want to go enjoy myself
and get some R&R on the beach.

23:55.145 --> 23:56.949
I heard that there's...

23:56.949 --> 23:58.820
Let me tell you firsthand as
a guy who's from the East Coast,

23:58.820 --> 24:00.022
who never went to the beach,
and now he lives on the beach,

24:00.022 --> 24:01.759
it's so overrated.

24:01.759 --> 24:02.894
Well, you should let me
experience that for myself.

24:02.894 --> 24:04.163
- I...
- A different day,

24:04.163 --> 24:05.900
when I'm not, like,
fully injured.

24:05.900 --> 24:06.769
This isn't Madden.
You can't turn off injuries.

24:06.769 --> 24:08.038
You're not fully...

24:08.038 --> 24:09.675
- Let's-- I don't know...
- (phone buzzing)

24:09.675 --> 24:12.914
what to do.
Let's fuck on the beach.

24:12.914 --> 24:14.785
- What?
- (whispers): Let's
fuck on the beach.

24:14.785 --> 24:16.187
- Ah!
- Let's...

24:16.187 --> 24:18.493
I'm, like, so
weirded out by that.

24:18.493 --> 24:19.962
I don't know
how to react to that.

24:19.962 --> 24:21.632
- I'm not gonna...
- You owe me outdoor sex.

24:21.632 --> 24:23.770
I owe you outdoor sex?
Are you serious?

24:23.770 --> 24:25.540
- (stammers)
- You really believe that?

24:25.540 --> 24:26.942
Nah, I don't know.

24:26.942 --> 24:28.045
Look, I'm not the guy
that's gonna, like,

24:28.045 --> 24:29.682
get hurt for you like Rambo,

24:29.682 --> 24:31.819
or fuck you on the beach
like a gladiator, okay?

24:31.819 --> 24:33.121
That's not who I am.

24:33.121 --> 24:34.525
And maybe we just don't
know each other,

24:34.525 --> 24:35.927
and we're forcing
this whole thing.

24:35.927 --> 24:37.664
Like, please,
let's just go home.

24:37.664 --> 24:39.267
I'm going home, personally.
I hope you come with...

24:39.267 --> 24:41.772
Fuck it. Dave, I'm trying
to get you to a surprise party!

24:43.843 --> 24:45.947
- What?
- Yeah. Your friends,

24:45.947 --> 24:48.619
they are texting me right now,
all day,

24:48.619 --> 24:50.289
and they-- I-- they told me
to get you to the beach,

24:50.289 --> 24:52.026
- 'cause they're all there
just waiting for you.
- Now?

24:52.026 --> 24:53.529
- And I...
- That's why you've been
acting this way?

24:53.529 --> 24:54.732
Yes! That's why
I'm acting like this.

24:54.732 --> 24:55.934
I don't even like the beach!

24:55.934 --> 24:58.740
I hate the beach.
And I hate lying.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.944
I'm so bad at lying.
This is so...

25:00.944 --> 25:03.549
stressful, I'm sweating so much.

25:03.549 --> 25:04.952
I hate lying, too.

25:04.952 --> 25:06.889
Yeah, I've...

25:06.889 --> 25:08.826
I faked my own death.

25:09.862 --> 25:11.599
Well, I didn't
fake my own death,

25:11.599 --> 25:13.135
but I did pretend
to be dead for longer,

25:13.135 --> 25:15.139
because the views and
the streams were just going

25:15.139 --> 25:16.842
so fucking crazy.

25:16.842 --> 25:18.846
I got your voice mail,
I wanted to call you back,

25:18.846 --> 25:23.589
I didn't, and I haven't really
told anyone this, and...

25:23.589 --> 25:25.159
I'm a piece of shit, I guess.

25:25.159 --> 25:27.063
And now you know that I am.

25:28.031 --> 25:30.637
No. I...

25:30.637 --> 25:34.645
I faked my own personality
the past 24 hours.

25:34.645 --> 25:37.149
So, that's just human nature.

25:37.149 --> 25:40.055
I guess, you know? When you just
want something bad enough,

25:40.055 --> 25:43.128
you just... do it.

25:43.128 --> 25:45.065
So, I...

25:45.065 --> 25:48.038
♪ ♪

25:52.346 --> 25:54.752
Let's go to the surprise party.
No more lying.

25:54.752 --> 25:58.024
Except for pretending to know
about the surprise

25:58.024 --> 25:59.628
- situation.
- That's acting, that's acting.

25:59.628 --> 26:01.030
I know exactly how to play this.

26:01.030 --> 26:02.299
I still am injured,
but I'm gonna act not.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.870
- Come on, let's go.
- Are you okay?

26:03.870 --> 26:05.205
- Yeah.
- Do you need an Advil?

26:05.205 --> 26:06.609
DAVE: I don't need
anything except you.

26:10.015 --> 26:11.752
I have your b

26:11.752 --> 26:13.689
- I'm watching... Okay.
- Watch this acting.

26:13.689 --> 26:15.894
ALL:
Surprise!

26:15.894 --> 26:17.931
(cheering and applause)

26:17.931 --> 26:20.770
DAVE:
Mom, Dad, I didn't know
you were here! Hi!

26:20.770 --> 26:22.841
You flew in.
You got cheesesteaks.

26:22.841 --> 26:24.010
You knew about this?

26:24.010 --> 26:26.982
- I did. Yeah.
- (sighs)

26:26.982 --> 26:28.653
- You did it!
- ROBYN: I did.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.155
- You earned this.
- Thank you.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.324
- Good work.
- DAVE: Hi.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.794
ALLY: Great work.
Did you not know?

26:32.794 --> 26:34.163
- I had no idea.
- You really didn't know?

26:34.163 --> 26:36.735
Thank you, Gata.
Thank you, Gata.

26:36.735 --> 26:38.906
Give it to me. Hey, brother.

26:38.906 --> 26:41.010
(overlapping chatter)

26:41.010 --> 26:42.747
Gata, do you really
need this shot?

26:42.747 --> 26:44.383
I'm just trying to show them
what this hard working

26:44.383 --> 26:45.687
- gets you.
We on the beachfront, man.
- Yeah. Oh...

26:45.687 --> 26:47.189
- (beeping)
- It's your alarm.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.993
It says you gotta go to
bed soon so you can get

26:48.993 --> 26:50.864
- your 11 and a half
hours of sleep.
- Ah, okay.

26:50.864 --> 26:52.399
- All right, keep working hard.
- Hey, Mike! How's it going?

26:52.399 --> 26:53.769
Hey, Don.

26:53.769 --> 26:55.239
It's good. Really good.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.176
(distant chatter)

26:57.944 --> 27:00.817
- Happy b irthday.
- Thank you. I can't believe

27:00.817 --> 27:03.088
that you guys
flew out here for me.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.392
- I love you. Yeah.
- DON: Hey. We love you.
- CAROL: Are you kidding? Honey!

27:05.392 --> 27:07.096
- DON: It's your birthday.
- DAVE: Oh, hold on, hold on,
you know what?

27:07.096 --> 27:08.933
I want to introduce you guys
to somebody.

27:08.933 --> 27:10.135
- Yes.
- Come here.

27:10.135 --> 27:11.404
- Oh. Hi.
- This is Robyn.

27:11.404 --> 27:13.275
- Hi.
- Oh, this is the famous Robyn?

27:13.275 --> 27:15.747
- Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

27:15.747 --> 27:17.416
Oh, you are lovely.

27:17.416 --> 27:20.055
- Dave, you have a little white...
- Okay. What are you doing?

27:20.055 --> 27:23.128
EMMA: Dave and Robyn
are actually kind of cute.

27:23.128 --> 27:24.965
Yeah.

27:24.965 --> 27:26.735
- You know what else is cute?
- What?

27:28.238 --> 27:29.708
What the fuck?

27:29.708 --> 27:31.411
- (both laughing)
- You missed!

27:31.411 --> 27:34.718
- It's okay.
- Oh, fuck it.

27:34.718 --> 27:36.956
Can I show you your present?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.391
- You got me something?
- Oh, yeah.

27:40.295 --> 27:42.667
A photograph of an elephant.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.305
Not just any elephant.
He's yours.

27:45.305 --> 27:47.009
What do you mean, he's mine?

27:47.009 --> 27:49.146
Well, I found an organization
that rescues them,

27:49.146 --> 27:50.783
and I adopted him in your name.

27:50.783 --> 27:52.921
- In Africa.
- No, you didn't.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.725
Yeah, so you--
we pay for, like, his food,

27:54.725 --> 27:56.896
and his little
elephant medicine.

27:56.896 --> 27:59.000
That's-- his name's Esoit.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.803
- Do you like it?
- "You-so-it."
