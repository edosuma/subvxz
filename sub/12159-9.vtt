18:51.564 --> 18:53.264
YOU CAN NOW USE THE SPACE
FOR YOUR OFFICE.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.365
AH.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.270
YOU KNOW, I HATED TO THINK
OF MANDY LEAVING.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.005
HONEY, SHE CAN'T LIVE HERE
FOREVER.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.674
ALTHOUGH, WHEN WE SAW HER
TEST SCORES FROM GRADE SCHOOL,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.576
WE THOUGHT MAYBE...

19:07.146 --> 19:09.313
WE CAN'T FIGHT CHANGE,
BABE.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.149
WELL, YOU DID. I MEAN,
YOU GOT YOUR INCANDESCENTS.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.950
THIS IS JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.786
CHUEY SAYS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT
OF INCANDESCENTS.
WHO'S CHUEY?

19:15.788 --> 19:18.789

THAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA.

[ SIGHS ]

19:20.426 --> 19:23.661
WELL, IRONICALLY, EVE IS THE ONE
WHO WANTED MANDY GONE,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.830
AND SHE'S THE ONE
WHO BLEW IT UP.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.799
SHE REALLY
SHOT HERSELF IN THE FOOT.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.635
I DON'T THINK SO.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.737
SHE'S A BETTER SHOT
THAN THAT.

19:34.706 --> 19:38.376
SO, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'LL BE
SHARING A BATHROOM AGAIN, HUH?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.443
YEAH.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.978
I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD

19:40.980 --> 19:43.314
TO HAVING A DRY TOWEL
AFTER I SHOWER.

19:43.316 --> 19:47.518
NOW IT'S BACK TO ROLLING AROUND
LIKE A DOG ON THE BATHMAT.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.387
I, UH, SHARE A BATHROOM
WITH YOUR MOM.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.689
ON OCCASION, I'VE DRIED MYSELF
OFF WITH A Q-TIP.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.659
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:54.661 --> 19:57.328
IT OCCURS TO ME,
AFTER HEARING THIS STORY,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.163
THAT IF YOU REALLY WANTED
MANDY TO LEAVE,

19:59.165 --> 20:01.566
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS TO KEEP QUIET.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.302
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I SCREWED UP.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.703
DID YOU SCREW UP,

20:05.705 --> 20:07.405
OR DO YOU REALLY LIKE
HAVING YOUR SISTER HERE?

20:07.407 --> 20:10.575
BORROWING HER SWEATERS,
WATCHING STUPID TV SHOWS,

20:10.577 --> 20:13.578
MAKING FUN OF HER
FOR WATCHING STUPID TV SHOWS.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.114
THAT'S NOT ME. YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOURSELF, OLD MAN.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.418
I DON'T BORROW HER SWEATERS,

20:20.420 --> 20:24.155
EXCEPT THAT BLACK CASHMERE
WHICH GOES WITH EVERYTHING.

20:24.157 --> 20:27.692
LISTEN, HONEY,
JUST LIKE WHEN KRIS LEFT,

20:27.694 --> 20:29.493
MANDY'S GONNA LEAVE,

20:29.495 --> 20:31.762
AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO APPRECIATE PEOPLE

20:31.764 --> 20:33.564
WHILE THEY'RE STILL HERE.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.603
UM...I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'D MISS HER, DAD.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.705
I THINK
WE'LL BOTH MISS HER.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.974
I'M JUST THE ONE
THAT'LL SAY IT.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.377
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU BAILED ON ME

20:46.379 --> 20:47.878
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF MY DAD.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.615
IT IS NOT BECAUSE
I'M AFRAID OF YOUR DAD.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.950
I just don't think
it's the right thing to do.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.518
WHEN WE MOVE IN TOGETHER,

20:54.520 --> 20:57.021
I WANT EVERYONE TO BE REALLY
HAPPY FOR US, ESPECIALLY ME.

AFRAID OF YOUR DAD.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.966
UM...
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

21:08.968 --> 21:11.269
THAT I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT MOVING OUT

AND I'D MISS YOU.
