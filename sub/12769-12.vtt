WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.000 --> 00:08.959
OH, WHAT ABOUT PEONIES?
PEONIES COULD BE GOOD.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.583
(Addison) I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.583
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S WEDDING,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW

00:12.625 --> 00:15.583
WHAT KIND OF FLOWERS
SHE WANTS?
BIZZY MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

00:15.625 --> 00:17.583
THAT THIS WEDDING
IS FOR SUSAN.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.542
OKAY. THEN WHAT WOULD
SUSAN WANT?
AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.375
UGH. YOU'RE BEING PETULANT.
WELL, I AM ENTITLED, NAI.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.583
I AM THROWING A WEDDING
FOR MY MOTHER

00:25.625 --> 00:28.458
AND HER... (lowered voice)
LESBIAN MISTRESS/LOVER.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.959
(normal voice)
MY MOTHER. OKAY?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.375
WHO, BY THE WAY,
NEVER THANKED ME

00:32.417 --> 00:35.250
FOR SAVING THE LIFE OF HER
LESBIAN MISTRESS/LOVER.
I TOLD YOU, IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING FROM THAT WOMAN,

00:35.291 --> 00:37.250
YOU HAVE TO ASK HER FOR IT.
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT THIS?

00:37.291 --> 00:39.750
"BIZZY, STOP BEING A LESBIAN
AND GO BACK TO YOUR HUSBAND.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.208
"STAY IN THE CLOSET--
YOUR VERY LARGE,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.959
WELL-DECORATED CLOSET."
HOMOPHOBE.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.583
I KNOW, RIGHT? BUT ONLY
WHEN IT COMES TO HER.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.750
I MEAN, IF IT WERE YOU,
IF YOU WANTED TO MARRY

00:49.792 --> 00:52.750
YOUR LESBIAN MISTRESS/LOVER,
I WOULD THROW YOU A PARADE.

00:52.792 --> 00:55.500
I WOULD MARCH ON THE CAPITAL
UNTIL IT WAS LEGAL.

00:55.542 --> 00:58.291
BUT WITH HER, I MEAN, WHAT--
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

00:58.333 --> 01:00.291
WHY AM I BEING LIKE THIS?
WELL, SHE'S YOUR MOMMY.

01:00.333 --> 01:04.041
MY MOMMY? MOMMIES ARE WARM.
MY NANNY WAS WARM, BUT SHE...

01:04.083 --> 01:06.041
SHE'S MY BIZZY.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.417
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY YOU ARE BEING LIKE THIS.

01:08.458 --> 01:11.417
LOOK, YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
SHE WAS COLD AND HARD,

01:11.458 --> 01:13.875
AND SHE'S ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING
WARM AND WONDERFUL.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.166
SHE'S ABOUT TO PLEDGE
HER LOVE...
(clears throat)

01:16.208 --> 01:18.792
WHICH MEANS YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE WRONG ABOUT HER,

01:18.834 --> 01:21.458
WHICH MEANS SHE MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE YOUR MOMMY.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.041
(inhales deeply)

01:23.083 --> 01:25.875
ALL RIGHT, SUSAN--
SHE LIKES UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE.

01:25.917 --> 01:30.083
OKAY. THEN LET'S FIND
AN UNDERSTATED, ELEGANT FLOWER.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.083
(man) YOU CAME.
(TVs playing indistinctly)

01:32.125 --> 01:34.917
YOU SAW ME.
NOW CROSS IT OFF YOUR LIST.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.542
I'LL SEE YOU IN SIX MONTHS.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.542
SEE?
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.542
LISA, LISA,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:40.583 --> 01:43.041
HE DRINKS COGNAC LIKE
IT'S WATER, HE ONLY WEARS

01:43.083 --> 01:45.917
THAT STUPID TRACK SUIT THAT
I BOUGHT HIM 20 YEARS AGO,

01:45.959 --> 01:48.667
AND HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S READY
FOR THE TUBERCULAR WARD.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.083
BUT IF HE DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN,
THEN WHY SHOULD I?

01:51.125 --> 01:53.083
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BRING SOMEONE IN

01:53.125 --> 01:54.709
TO HELP OUT AROUND HERE?

01:54.750 --> 01:57.041
OH, HE'S GOT SOMEONE. SIMONE.
SHE'S HIDING IN THE BEDROOM

01:57.083 --> 01:59.750
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
HOW MUCH I DETEST HER.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.875
SHE DOESN'T HELP.
SHE INDULGES HIM.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.583
(sighs) I MISS MY MOM.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.291
YEAH. SHE WAS, UH,
AN AMAZING LADY.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.750
(sighs)

02:08.792 --> 02:12.166
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GO.

02:12.208 --> 02:16.041
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
IF A POLITICIAN IS LYING?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.041
HIS LIPS ARE MOVING.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.709
(coughing)
(mutes volume on TVs)

02:20.750 --> 02:23.041
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT SOUND IS?

02:23.083 --> 02:25.667
TOO MANY CIGARS
AND TOO FEW WALKS.

02:25.709 --> 02:28.458
GO DRUM UP BUSINESS
SOMEWHERE ELSE, SMART GUY.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.667
THIS PLACE IS FILLED
WITH VEINY OLD BIDDIES

02:30.709 --> 02:33.834
WHO WOULD LOVE
YOUR ATTENTION.
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?

02:33.875 --> 02:37.750
(coughs) YOU KNEW ESTY.
(door opens)

02:37.792 --> 02:41.709
WITHOUT HER, WHAT HAVE I GOT
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

02:41.750 --> 02:43.291
(woman) HEY.
(cell phone beeping)

02:43.333 --> 02:46.583
HEY, ENOUGH WITH THE ZIPPING
AND ZAPPING. I'M HUNGRY.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.625
OH, HI.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.834
HI.
OH, SIMONE,
THIS IS, UH, SAM BENNETT.

02:50.875 --> 02:54.208
HE WAS ESTY'S DOCTOR,
AND NOW HE'S A PAIN IN MY ASS.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.750
I WAS GONNA GRAB ABE
SOME LUNCH.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.291
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?
NO. NO, THANK YOU.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.041
UH, GO TO LANGLER'S,
ALL RIGHT?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.834
IT'S THE BEST PASTRAMI IN L.A.
NOW THAT MY DELI IS CLOSED.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.542
BUT THAT'S LIKE BEING
THE WORLD'S TALLEST MIDGET,

03:06.583 --> 03:09.792
BUT STILL--
W-WHY DON'T I BUY US ALL
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE HEALTHY,

03:09.834 --> 03:12.041
UH, LIKE, UH,
TURKEY SANDWICHES?

03:12.083 --> 03:16.000
I'M RUNNING LOW. UH, UH,
GET ME A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF--

03:16.041 --> 03:17.583
MILK.
YEAH.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.000
GOT IT, HANDSOME.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.041
(door opens and closes)

03:23.083 --> 03:26.250
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S NOT HELPING YOU.
SURE SHE IS.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.667
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE ME

03:28.709 --> 03:31.583
TO SHUFFLE OVER TO
THE LIQUOR STORE AND BACK?
AT LEAST LET SIMONE BRING YOU
UP TO MY OFFICE.

03:31.625 --> 03:33.750
LET ME SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT COUGH.

03:33.792 --> 03:36.583
THANKS FOR VISITING.

03:36.625 --> 03:40.083
(TVs playing indistinctly)

03:40.125 --> 03:42.834
I WAS RAPED...

03:42.875 --> 03:45.250
IN MY OFFICE.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.125
PHYSICAL PAIN
WAS GONE IN A WEEK.

03:49.625 --> 03:52.834
THE FEELINGS...

03:52.875 --> 03:55.500
I GET SCARED SOMETIMES.

03:55.542 --> 03:58.625
AND I GET SAD.

03:58.667 --> 04:02.083
THE DAYS FEEL LONGER
THAN THEY SHOULD.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.625
AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.834
YOU'RE DEPRESSED.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.834
I SAID I GET SAD.
OKAY.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.208
(exhales deeply)

04:12.250 --> 04:14.709
I CAN'T, UH...

04:14.750 --> 04:16.625
(clock ticking)

04:16.667 --> 04:18.500
COOPER'S WONDERFUL.

04:18.542 --> 04:20.834
HE'S THE BEST.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.500
BUT I CAN'T, UH...

04:23.542 --> 04:25.625
I TRY,
BUT I CAN'T HAVE SEX.

04:25.667 --> 04:26.542
MM.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.333
EVERY TIME WE TRY,

04:28.375 --> 04:30.333
I GET THIS PICTURE
IN MY HEAD.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.375
I'M LYING ON THE FLOOR...

04:33.875 --> 04:35.834
AND THAT MAN'S ON TOP OF ME,

04:35.875 --> 04:38.083
BUT I'M NOT WATCHING
FROM BELOW.

04:38.125 --> 04:40.041
I'M ABOVE HIM...

04:40.083 --> 04:42.542
LIKE A SPECTATOR
TO MY OWN RAPE.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.041
(scoffs)

04:46.083 --> 04:48.041
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

04:48.083 --> 04:50.583
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

04:50.625 --> 04:53.166
THERE IT IS. (scoffs)
PSYCHOBABBLE.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.041
ASK A QUESTION.
GET A QUESTION BACK.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.667
WHOLE THING'S RIDICULOUS.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.667
I TOLD COOPER
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.667
AND CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU?

05:00.709 --> 05:04.083
I DON'T WANT YOU IN MY HEAD.
I DON'T NEED YOU IN MY HEAD.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.458
I AGREE. TALK THERAPY--

05:06.500 --> 05:09.500
IT WON'T HELP.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.750
I'M...

05:11.792 --> 05:14.333
PRESCRIBING
A COCKTAIL OF DRUGS.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.333
A COMBINATION
OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS,

05:16.375 --> 05:18.166
MOOD STABILIZERS,

05:18.208 --> 05:21.542
SOME TRANQUILIZERS,
JUST TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.041
NOW YOUR MOOD, YOUR SLEEP,
YOUR ENERGY,

05:24.083 --> 05:26.000
IT'LL GET BETTER.

05:26.041 --> 05:29.041
NOW I'VE WRITTEN
FOUR REFILLS,

05:29.083 --> 05:31.750
SO YOU'RE GOOD
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

05:35.250 --> 05:45.041
GOOD LUCK.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.333
LUNGS ARE CLEAR.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.208
(Addison) VITALS LOOK GOOD.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.291
(Susan)
DID YOU ASK HIM?

05:51.333 --> 05:54.041
I DIDN'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.208
ASK ME WHAT?

05:56.250 --> 05:58.458
OUR WEDDING--WE WOULD
LOVE FOR YOU TO COME.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.041
IMPOSING. YOU'RE IMPOSING.
OH, NOT AT ALL.
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.667
I'LL BE BACK LATER, AND I'M
LOOKING FORWARD TO A DANCE.

06:05.709 --> 06:07.458
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:07.500 --> 06:09.542
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:09.583 --> 06:13.458
(singsongy) I THINK HE HAS
A THING FOR YOU.
I'M WITH SAM.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.625
FOR NOW.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.375
DR. RODRIGUEZ IS FROM
A PROMINENT FAMILY

06:18.417 --> 06:21.375
IN SOUTH AMERICA--
VERY WEALTHY.
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND,
BIZZY.

06:21.417 --> 06:25.041
I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT IT'S
AS EASY TO FALL--
I LOVE SAM.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.375
YOU DON'T CHOOSE
WHO YOU LOVE.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.125
RIGHT, LADIES?

06:31.458 --> 06:34.041
YOU SHOULD SEE
HOW HE'S LIVING, NAI.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.417
THE GIRL WHO'S TAKING CARE
OF HIM DOESN'T CLEAN,

06:36.458 --> 06:38.583
LETS HIM DRINK, EAT,
SMOKE ALL DAY.
WELL, SO TELL HIS DAUGHTER.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.875
SHE WAS THERE.
I WALKED IN ON THEM FIGHTING.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.834
HE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO HER EITHER.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.792
I THOUGHT THEY HAD A BETTER
RELATIONSHIP THAN THAT.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.041
YOU REMEMBER HOW WE USED
TO THINK OF HIM AS A--

06:47.083 --> 06:48.625
AS A CHARMING CURMUDGEON?
(laughs)

06:48.667 --> 06:51.834
WELL--
NOW HE'S JUST A CURMUDGEON?

06:51.875 --> 06:53.834
YES.
OH, WELL, MAYBE HE'S HAPPY
LIKE THAT,

06:53.875 --> 06:55.375
OR HIS VERSION OF HAPPY.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.417
NO. HE DESERVES TO BE
TAKEN CARE OF.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.542
SAM, IT'S WONDERFUL THAT YOU
STILL CARE ABOUT ABE.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.875
BUT WHAT ABE WANTS TO DO
WITH THE TIME HE HAS LEFT,

07:03.917 --> 07:05.959
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.500
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH VIOLET?

07:08.542 --> 07:11.500
I MEAN, IS SHE TOO COOL
TO CALL ME OR WHAT?
SHE JUST HAS ALL THESE
MEETINGS WITH HER PUBLISHER.

07:11.542 --> 07:14.917
YOUR FRIEND LARRY'S
IN THE WRONG LINE OF WORK.
(Sheldon) WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:14.959 --> 07:17.709
HE'S A PHARMACIST
NOT A THERAPIST.
WHO'S LARRY?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.250
DR. LARRY CANNON--

07:19.291 --> 07:21.500
MY BEST FRIEND
AND A BRILLIANT PSYCHIATRIST.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.208
YOU HAVE A BEST FRIEND?
WHAT ARE YOU, 12? (laughs)

07:24.250 --> 07:26.667
YEAH. MM.

07:26.709 --> 07:28.709
YOU'RE SEEING A SHRINK?
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.625
NOT GOOD. ALL HE TRIED TO DO
WAS PUSH DRUGS ON ME.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.458
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DID YOU TRY TALKING TO HIM--

07:34.500 --> 07:36.959
YOU THINK I HAULED MY ASS
ACROSS TOWN TO SIT IN SILENCE?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.250
I TRIED.
HE WASN'T INTERESTED.
THERE'S ENOUGH DRUGS THERE
TO PARALYZE AN ELEPHANT.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.458
OH, THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
LARRY ISN'T A PILL GUY.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.166
HE PIONEERED
NARRATIVE TALK THERAPY.

07:43.208 --> 07:46.041
HE TAUGHT IT TO ME.
IT'S THE BASIS OF MY PRACTICE.
NARRATIVE--

07:46.083 --> 07:49.667
THAT'S USING THE STORY
OF PEOPLE'S LIVES, RIGHT?
LARRY WASN'T INTERESTED
IN MY STORIES.

07:49.709 --> 07:51.750
HE JUST WANTED TO WRITE ME
A SCRIP.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.500
MAYBE HE THOUGHT YOU NEEDED
TO BE STABILIZED

07:54.542 --> 07:56.750
BEFORE YOU STARTED TALKING.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.083
THAT SOUNDED BAD, RIGHT?

08:00.125 --> 08:02.041
YEAH, IT DID.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.041
CHARLOTTE, I'M SORRY.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.542
LOOK, LARRY'S BEEN TRAVELING
A LOT, AND, UH,

08:06.583 --> 08:08.959
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT I'LL TALK TO HIM.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.583
I'LL EXPLAIN YOU WEREN'T
LOOKING FOR PILLS.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.625
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP
AFTER ONLY ONE SESSION.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.041
I CAN, AND I WILL.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.125
(door opens)

08:17.166 --> 08:19.542
(woman) DR. DYSON,
DIAL THE PAGE OPERATOR.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.625
DR. DYSON,
DIAL THE PAGE OPERATOR.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.041
Y-YOU KNOW YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO COME

08:25.083 --> 08:26.500
TO THEIR WEDDING.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.250
I LIKE WEDDINGS.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.125
SUSAN GOES
IN THE "WIN" COLUMN.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.750
THAT'S ALWAYS
WORTH CELEBRATING.

08:34.792 --> 08:39.375
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE
I EVER SAID--
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

08:39.417 --> 08:42.625
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME,
AND YOU WERE WILLING TO TRY.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.667
I'M NOT SURE
I COULD SAY NO TO YOU.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.667
(laughs) OKAY.
I'M WITH SAM.
MM-HMM.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.875
YOU KNOW I'M WITH SAM.
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.375
I AM NOT INTERESTED.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.041
WELL, IF THAT WERE TRUE,

08:53.083 --> 08:56.333
YOU WOULDN'T CARE
THAT I FLIRT WITH YOU.
OKAY.

08:56.375 --> 08:59.208
YOU ARE NOT HEARING ME,
AND I--

08:59.250 --> 09:01.166
I NEED TO GO.

09:04.083 --> 09:07.208
(indistinct conversations)

09:13.083 --> 09:15.250
YOU DO REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T
EVEN PLAN MY OWN WEDDING.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.625
BECAUSE I DID.
YOU'RE RETURNING THE FAVOR.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.625
I GET THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE
SUSAN THIS WEDDING,

09:20.667 --> 09:22.166
BUT IT'S...

09:22.208 --> 09:25.250
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T GET IT.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.208
BASED ON YOUR SHAM OF A MARRIAGE
TO THE CAPTAIN,

09:27.250 --> 09:29.625
I MEAN, YOU CLEARLY DON'T
TAKE VOWS THAT SERIOUSLY,

09:29.667 --> 09:31.625
AND WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE A CHEATER.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.917
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY,
FOR PASSING THAT DOWN.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.041
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THAT
INFIDELITY IS NOT GENETIC.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.041
AND IF WE AGREE
IT'S LEARNED BEHAVIOR,

09:38.083 --> 09:40.208
YOU CERTAINLY DIDN'T
LEARN IT FROM ME, DEAR,

09:40.250 --> 09:42.208
BECAUSE YOU HAD NO IDEA
WHAT I WAS UP TO

09:42.250 --> 09:44.458
UNTIL LONG AFTER YOU'D MADE
YOUR OWN MISTAKES.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.083
IT REALLY IS TIME
FOR YOU TO GROW UP

09:47.125 --> 09:50.208
AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.041
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS,
I'VE HAD MY PROVERBIAL CAKE--

09:53.083 --> 09:55.041
HOMES, HUSBAND,
CHILDREN, JEWELS,

09:55.083 --> 09:57.041
LADIES AUXILIARY--

09:57.083 --> 09:58.542
AND THAT WHOLE TIME,

09:58.583 --> 10:01.542
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE WAITED
PATIENTLY IN THE CLOSET

10:01.583 --> 10:03.500
BECAUSE THAT WAS MY WAY.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.959
I ALMOST LOST SUSAN,
BUT SHE'S HEALTHY NOW,

10:07.000 --> 10:11.625
SO THIS TIME WE DO IT HER WAY,
AND SHE WANTS A WEDDING.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.083
I'M A LESBIAN, DEAR.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.291
DEAL WITH IT.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.250
(mouths words)

10:18.291 --> 10:20.291
(man) I JUST WANT
TO GET A SCHEDULE.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.750
HEY. I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.750
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO COUGH UP A LUNG,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.750
SO THERE YOU ARE.

10:27.792 --> 10:30.583
YOU WANT ME TO EXAMINE YOU?
UH, NO.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.667
I JUST CAME HERE FOR
THE "EXPECTANT MOTHER" MAGAZINE.
(laughs)

10:33.709 --> 10:36.125
UH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO COME IN.
YOU SURE?

10:36.166 --> 10:37.667
AN AUDIENCE
MAKES HIM NERVOUS.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.583
OKAY. UH, RIGHT THIS WAY.
(indistinct conversations)

10:40.625 --> 10:42.875
JUST TELL HIM
DR. WALLACE CALLED AGAIN.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.333
W-A-L--LOOK, JUST TELL HIM
TO CALL SHELDON

10:45.375 --> 10:46.959
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.458
YES, THANK YOU.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG IT TOOK ME

10:49.500 --> 10:52.083
TO CONVINCE HER TO GO?
WE HAD ONE SHOT AT THIS.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.041
COOPER--
NO. CHARLOTTE'S NOT LIKE US,
SHELDON.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.041
SHE DOESN'T SHARE EVERY FEELING
AND VOCALIZE EVERY THOUGHT.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.125
SHE COMES FROM A FAMILY
OF MUTES.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.291
HER DAD NEVER SAID HE LOVED HER.
HER MOTHER DENIED

11:00.333 --> 11:02.500
SHE HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM
UNTIL HER LIVER IMPLODED.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.000
SO FOR HER TO BE WILLING
TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY

11:05.041 --> 11:06.959
ABOUT THE RAPE--
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET--

11:07.000 --> 11:09.208
NO, NO, NO, SHE NEEDS THIS.
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.750
SHE'S ALWAYS
LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.625
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS...

11:13.667 --> 11:16.542
THIS ISN'T THE LARRY I KNOW.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.333
YOU SAID HE WAS THE BEST.
HE IS THE BEST.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.333
LARRY IS THE REASON
I BECAME A THERAPIST.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.333
OKAY, WATCHING HIM
CONNECT TO PEOPLE,

11:23.375 --> 11:25.625
UN-UNRAVELING THEIR PROBLEMS,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS INSPIRING.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.792
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

11:27.834 --> 11:31.625
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.041
(Addison) OKAY, SO...
(snaps fingers)

11:35.083 --> 11:37.041
HOTEL'S BOOKED.
FLOWERS ARE DONE.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.750
MUSIC...
DO YOU HAVE THE FINAL COUNT
FOR THE CATERER?

11:39.792 --> 11:41.750
OH. WELL, BIZZY HAS
NO FRIENDS HERE,

11:41.792 --> 11:44.625
AND I DON'T THINK
SUSAN HAS FRIENDS.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.625
(laughs)

11:46.667 --> 11:48.458
UH, THE CAPTAIN
IS CLEARLY NOT ATTENDING.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.458
OH, AND MY BROTHER
E-MAILED THIS MORNING,

11:50.500 --> 11:52.625
SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T COME
TO BIZZY'S FIRST WEDDING,

11:52.667 --> 11:54.625
SO HE'S NOT COMING
TO HER SECOND.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.542
SO I GUESS...
THAT JUST LEAVES US,

11:57.583 --> 12:00.458
EXCEPT, UM, FOR VIOLET
WHO'S IN NEW YORK, SO...

12:00.500 --> 12:02.583
UH, THAT'S TEN.
NO, NO.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.667
(snaps fingers)
11. DR. RODRIGUEZ,
HE'S ATTENDING.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.583
WHY--WHY DID YOU
INVITE HIM?

12:06.625 --> 12:09.709
I DIDN'T. SUSAN DID.
WHY? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

12:09.750 --> 12:11.041
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

12:11.083 --> 12:14.583
I SAW YOU IN THE HOSPITAL
FLIRTING WITH HIM.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.041
N-NO.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.500
NO, NAI.
HE WAS FLIRTING WITH ME.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.041
I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
NAI.

12:21.083 --> 12:25.083
ALL RIGHT. HE--DR. RODRIGUEZ
ASKED ME OUT AGES AGO.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.417
BUT I TOLD HIM THAT I AM
IN LOVE WITH SAM.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.625
WELL, CLEARLY,
YOU WEREN'T VERY CONVINCING.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.625
OKAY, NAI, COME ON.
STOP, ALL RIGHT?

12:32.667 --> 12:34.875
I'M ALREADY INSANE ENOUGH WITH
BIZZY BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.125
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I JUST, UH...

12:37.166 --> 12:39.125
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU AND SAM,

12:39.166 --> 12:42.041
I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU GUYS WERE GONNA LAST.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.458
I THOUGHT... (exhales)

12:44.500 --> 12:46.458
LOOK, UM, I'M NOT BIZZY,

12:46.500 --> 12:49.041
AND I AM NOT CRITICIZING
OR DOUBTING,

12:49.083 --> 12:52.083
BUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SAM
IS REAL NOW.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.542
AND...

12:53.583 --> 12:55.667
(sighs)

12:55.709 --> 12:57.125
WHEN IT GETS REAL,

12:57.166 --> 12:59.583
THAT'S USUALLY
WHEN YOU SCREW IT UP.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.041
WELL...

13:05.083 --> 13:07.500
NOT THIS TIME.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.709
(jangles keys)

13:09.750 --> 13:12.750
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE
PULMONARY DISEASE.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.041
BIG MEDICAL WORDS
DON'T SCARE ME.
(knock on door)

13:15.083 --> 13:16.667
HEY.

13:16.709 --> 13:19.291
THE BETTER-LOOKING
DR. BENNETT.
SAM TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.959
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME IN
AND SAY HI.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.125
OR HE DRAGGED YOU AWAY
FROM SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT

13:24.166 --> 13:25.583
TO PLAY GOOD COP

13:25.625 --> 13:28.917
AND TELL ME ALL THE THINGS
THAT I HAVE TO LIVE FOR.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.917
I'M OLD,
BUT I'M NOT STUPID.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.959
ABE, NOW, OUR--OUR ONLY
INTEREST HERE IS HELPING YOU.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.917
UNLESS YOU CAN RAISE
THE DEAD...

13:35.959 --> 13:38.583
LOOK, UH, WE REALIZE THAT
WE CAN'T REPLACE ESTY,

13:38.625 --> 13:41.500
BUT WE CAN HELP YOU FIND
SOMEBODY BETTER THAN SIMONE.

13:41.542 --> 13:44.041
SOMEONE WHO CAN COOK, CLEAN.
YOU SOUND LIKE LISA.

13:44.083 --> 13:47.041
WELL, MAYBE THAT SHOULD
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ESTY AND I...

13:47.083 --> 13:48.917
(sighs)

13:48.959 --> 13:51.375
SIMONE AND I ARE...

13:51.417 --> 13:53.458
WE'RE DOING JUST FINE.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.500
INSURANCE CARD.
OH, INSURANCE CARD. UM--

13:59.542 --> 14:00.792
OH.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.333
UM...
HERE YOU GO.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.208
THANKS.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.375
NO PROBLEM... MR. NUSSBAUM.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.375
UM, I ACTUALLY--HE--
I WORK FOR HIM.

14:09.417 --> 14:11.750
AND HE'S, UH, HE'S OLDER,
AN OLDER GUY.

14:11.792 --> 14:14.041
HE'S A PATIENT
OF DR. BENNETT.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.834
SO I CAN--I CAN--
I GOT THIS. THANKS.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.625
(clicking mouse)

14:23.667 --> 14:25.834
SO THIS IS WHY
YOU NEVER ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

14:25.875 --> 14:29.208
THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN PLAYING
MAH-JONGG FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,

14:29.250 --> 14:31.542
AND I JUST DISCOVERED IT
A WEEK AGO.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.458
HOW AMAZING IS THAT, HUH?
WHAT'S MORE AMAZING

14:33.500 --> 14:35.834
IS THAT LITTLE DRUG COCKTAIL
YOU WROTE DR. KING.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.458
OH. LOVELY LADY.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.041
KILLER SMILE.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.458
CHARLOTTE'S A COLLEAGUE
AND A FRIEND. I SENT HER TO YOU

14:41.500 --> 14:43.959
BECAUSE SHE SURVIVED
A TRAUMATIC SEXUAL ASSAULT,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.041
AND YOU SENT HER PACKING
IN FIVE MINUTES.
NOT EMPTY-HANDED.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.834
SINCE WHEN DO YOU

14:48.875 --> 14:52.041
REPLACE TALK THERAPY
WITH DRUG PROTOCOLS?

14:52.083 --> 14:53.709
SHELDON,

14:53.750 --> 14:56.917
THEY COME TO US DISTRAUGHT,

14:56.959 --> 14:58.583
EMOTIONALLY VOID.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.667
AND WE LISTEN.
WE TAKE IT ALL IN,

15:00.709 --> 15:02.667
INTERPRET THE DATA,
AND THEN WE RESPOND

15:02.709 --> 15:05.458
USING WHATEVER EXPERIENCE
WE HAVE.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.458
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.458
THE CYCLE REPEATS ITSELF--

15:09.500 --> 15:11.041
BREAKTHROUGH, RELAPSE--

15:11.083 --> 15:14.834
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AG--

15:14.875 --> 15:17.583
TALK THERAPY IS A SHAM.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.500
(chuckles)

15:19.542 --> 15:21.959
THAT'S CRAZY.
WE HELP PEOPLE.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.709
BY SHARING OUR INSIGHTS?

15:23.750 --> 15:26.875
WE'RE NOT HELPING ANYTHING.
NO.

15:26.917 --> 15:29.041
THESE GUYS DO.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.542
SHELDON, WE ARE MACHINES.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.083
EVERYTHING WE DO
IS CONTROLLED

15:34.125 --> 15:36.125
BY CHEMICAL NEUROTRANSMITTERS
IN OUR BRAIN.

15:36.166 --> 15:39.709
CRANK UP THE SEROTONIN,
AND WE FEEL EUPHORIC.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.709
DISSIPATE IT,
AND WE FEEL DEPRESSED.

15:41.750 --> 15:45.041
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
DRUGS HAVE A PLACE IN THERAPY.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.667
BUT IT--
IT'S NOT IN ISOLATION.
(tinkling)

15:47.709 --> 15:50.667
HUMAN INTERACTION IS CRITICAL.
YOU...

15:50.709 --> 15:54.458
YOU'VE SPENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
COMMITTED TO TALK THERAPY.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.917
YO-YOU'VE--

15:55.959 --> 15:58.041
YOU'VE HELPED THOUSANDS
OF PATIENTS.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.709
I WAS WRONG.
EVERYTHING THAT I TAUGHT YOU,

16:01.750 --> 16:04.500
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE BUILT
YOUR PRACTICE ON

16:04.542 --> 16:07.083
IS A LIE.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.250
IS BLACK WRONG?

16:10.291 --> 16:12.500
I MEAN, IT'S A WEDDING,
NOT A FUNERAL.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.333
YOU KNOW, BUT IT IS L.A.
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
YOURS TO BE LIKE?

16:15.375 --> 16:18.750
MY WHAT?
YOUR SECOND WEDDING. WHAT WOULD
YOU WANT IT TO BE LIKE?

16:18.792 --> 16:21.417
I DON'T KNOW.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.959
OKAY, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.959
NOT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT,
BUT BECAUSE...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.500
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HEAR IT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE

16:30.542 --> 16:31.959
AND MISUNDERSTAND.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
DO I WANT TO HEAR THIS?

16:34.041 --> 16:36.750
(exhales deeply)

16:36.792 --> 16:40.000
ERIC RODRIGUEZ
FLIRTED WITH ME.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.750
HE'S BEEN FLIRTING
WITH ME.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.750
BUT I DID NOT FLIRT BACK.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.041
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:47.083 --> 16:49.625
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

16:49.667 --> 16:51.667
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.750
AND NOW I DO.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.625
SHE HAD PROBABLY
A DOZEN CREDIT CARDS

17:05.667 --> 17:07.625
WITH YOUR DAD'S NAME
ON 'EM.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.625
(sighs)
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

17:09.667 --> 17:11.625
YOU THINK YOUR DAD
HAS ANY IDEA?

17:11.667 --> 17:15.125
EVEN IF HE KNEW, HE WOULDN'T
CARE. SHE'S PRETTY AND FLIRTY.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.000
YOU THINK THAT MATTERS TO HIM?
WELL, HE'S STILL
A MAN, NAOMI.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.583
AFTER MY MOM DIED,
HE BECAME A DIFFERENT PERSON.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.583
IT'S LIKE,
THE MORE HELP HE NEEDS,

17:22.625 --> 17:25.000
THE FARTHER AWAY
HE PUSHES ME.

17:25.041 --> 17:28.000
AND TO SETTLE
FOR THAT SIMONE...
WELL, SHE'S NOT TAKING
GOOD CARE OF YOUR DAD,

17:28.041 --> 17:30.667
AND NOW WITH THE CREDIT CARDS,
YOU SHOULD GET RID OF HER.

17:30.709 --> 17:34.041
AND THEN WHAT? HE CAN'T
BE ALONE. HE NEEDS HELP.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.917
WE'LL HELP YOU FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.
(Sam) DO YOU WANT TO TALK
TO SIMONE,

17:36.959 --> 17:40.041
OR SHOULD I?
CAN YOU JUST TELL HER

17:40.083 --> 17:42.041
TO STOP WHAT SHE'S DOING
AND TRY HARDER?

17:42.083 --> 17:45.166
LISA--
PLEASE.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH HIM.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.500
BUT SOMEONE HAS TO.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.583
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO UPSET HIM?
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
BLAMING HER?

17:50.625 --> 17:54.041
NO. NO, IT'S JUST, MAYBE
HE FELT THAT TALK THERAPY

17:54.083 --> 17:56.041
WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE
IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE.

17:56.083 --> 17:59.375
TALK THERAPY IS INEFFECTIVE.

17:59.417 --> 18:02.083
ARE YOU AND LARRY WORKING
FOR THE SAME DRUG COMPANY?
WHAT IS THE POINT

18:02.125 --> 18:04.500
OF SITTING ON A COUCH
AND BLABBING BACK AND FORTH

18:04.542 --> 18:06.542
WHEN EMOTIONS
ARE CONTROLLED BY CHEMICALS?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.458
WHEN YOUR CAR IS OUT OF GAS,

18:08.500 --> 18:10.667
YOU DON'T WHISPER IN THE TANK
TO GET IT MOVING.

18:10.709 --> 18:13.542
TALK THERAPY HAS 70 YEARS
OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES

18:13.583 --> 18:16.041
BACKING ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
BUT WHAT YOU DO
IN A YEAR OF THERAPY

18:16.083 --> 18:18.625
CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A DAY
WITH A LITTLE YELLOW PILL.
(Charlotte) TALKING
DOESN'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS,

18:18.667 --> 18:21.542
RISK OF DEPENDENCY,
NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS.

18:21.583 --> 18:24.458
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.
WELL, MAYBE HE WAS
TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.041
I MEAN, HE WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST DOCTOR

18:27.083 --> 18:30.458
TO HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART.
A CHANGE OF HEART I GET.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.625
BUT A COMPLETE 180
AFTER 25 YEARS?
WHAT DID HE SAY
WHEN YOU CONFRONTED HIM?

18:33.667 --> 18:35.041

29:38.917 --> 29:42.125
(laughs) UH, BIZZY IS READY
TO DO THE PICTURES, SO SHE'S--

29:42.166 --> 29:44.125
AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE DRESSED?
YES.

29:44.166 --> 29:47.041
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.
OKAY.
UH, DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

29:47.083 --> 29:48.792
NO, I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.
OKAY.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.041
ADDISON.
YEAH.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.709
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW GRATEFUL I AM,

29:52.750 --> 29:54.375
WE BOTH ARE,
FOR EVERYTHING.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.875
THANK YOU.

29:56.917 --> 30:00.166
IT'S NICE FOR AT LEAST
ONE OF YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.333
BIZZY DOESN'T...
WELL, YOU KNOW HER.

30:02.375 --> 30:05.375
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.
BUT WITH YOU, SHE'S...

30:07.125 --> 30:10.333
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST NEVER KNEW
THAT SHE COULD, UH--
LOVE?

30:10.375 --> 30:13.083
SHE LOVED YOU THE SECOND
THAT YOU WERE BORN,

30:13.125 --> 30:16.208
BUT INTIMACY HAS TO BE
WORKED ON BOTH SIDES.

30:18.834 --> 30:20.417
WHOA.
OH. OH. OH.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.417
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH. UH, YEAH.
NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.417
SUSAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:25.458 --> 30:27.208
I'M NOT BETTER, ADDIE.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.417
I'M BLOATING
AND I'M WEAK AGAIN.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.333
AND IT FEELS LIKE...

30:31.375 --> 30:34.208
I DID
BEFORE I WAS DIAGNOSED.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.208
I KNOW THE CANCER'S
COME BACK.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.041
NO. DR. RODRIGUEZ WOULDN'T
HAVE DISCHARGED YOU

30:38.083 --> 30:40.375
IF THAT WAS THE CASE.
HE WANTED ME TO STAY
AND DO TESTS,

30:40.417 --> 30:43.083
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
A CHOICE.

30:43.125 --> 30:46.125
DON'T BE MAD. PLEASE.

30:46.166 --> 30:49.625
I NEED TODAY.
BIZZY AND I BOTH DO.
NO, THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
ALL RIGHT?

30:49.667 --> 30:52.542
IF THE CANCER'S BACK,
THEN WE NEED TO FIGHT IT.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.417
WE CAN POST--WE CAN DELAY YOUR
WEDDING. WE'LL GET YOU BACK--
ADDISON, LISTEN TO ME.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.417
I SIGNED A D.N.R.

30:57.458 --> 31:00.041
NO DELAYS, NO MORE DOCTORS,
NO MORE EXAMS,

31:00.083 --> 31:02.417
NO EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES.

31:02.458 --> 31:04.250
AND YOU CAN'T TELL BIZZY.

31:04.291 --> 31:05.875
SUSAN, I--

31:05.917 --> 31:07.333
NO.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.458
YOUR MOTHER AND I...

31:09.500 --> 31:12.333
JUST GIVE US TODAY.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.417

31:14.458 --> 31:17.458

31:23.083 --> 31:25.417

31:25.458 --> 31:28.458
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.917
A-AND I NEED YOU
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

31:30.959 --> 31:32.291
OKAY. SHOOT.

31:32.333 --> 31:34.458
DO I SCREW THINGS UP?

31:34.500 --> 31:36.041
OH, YEAH.

31:36.083 --> 31:39.041
SERIOUSLY? I MEAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M ASKING, RIGHT?

31:39.083 --> 31:41.041
ABSOLUTELY,
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.709
WHEN THINGS GET DIFFICULT
OR SCARY IN A RELATIONSHIP,

31:43.750 --> 31:46.041
YOU SCREW IT UP.

31:46.083 --> 31:48.291
Y--WELL, YOU SAID
TO BE HONEST.

31:48.333 --> 31:52.000
I WAS JUST COMING TO TELL YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.500
YOU KNEW ABOUT SUSAN.
SHE'S SICK,

31:54.542 --> 31:56.500
AND YOU DISCHARGED HER ANYWAY.
(sighs)

31:56.542 --> 32:00.917
SHE WANTED TO BE HERE
WITH YOUR MOTHER.
YEAH? WELL, SHE SHOULD BE

32:00.959 --> 32:03.041
BACK AT THE HOSPITAL
WHERE WE COULD HELP HER,

32:03.083 --> 32:05.917
AND HOPEFULLY
GIVE THEM MORE THAN THIS.
THAT'S NOT
WHAT SUSAN ASKED FOR.
