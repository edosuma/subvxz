STEVE, STOP KIDDING.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.653
YOU'RE TELLING ME!

13:40.720 --> 13:42.122
TURN IT OFF.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.123
I CAN'T.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.225
IT'S EQUIPPED WITH
A FAIL-SAFE DEVICE.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.161
ONCE THE PROGRAM IS ACTIVATED,
IT CAN'T BE STOPPED.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.298
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
B-B-B-BUB.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.071
OUCH!

13:58.138 --> 14:01.942
WHY, I OUGHT TO
V-V-VAPORIZE YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.978
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

14:10.984 --> 14:13.286
OH, NOW, THAT'S JUST
PLAIN PATHETIC.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.558
DON'T PANIC, MY LOVE.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.093
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

14:20.160 --> 14:22.930
THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE
DURING A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION

14:22.996 --> 14:24.831
IS IN A REINFORCED
BASEMENT.

14:24.898 --> 14:28.435
NOT WHEN THE BOMB
IS IN THE BASEMENT WITH YOU.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.736
GOOD POINT.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.104
PANIC!

14:32.839 --> 14:34.707
S-S-S-SEVEN MINUTES LEFT.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.210
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE EXPOSED
TO 3 B-B-BILLION RADS

14:37.277 --> 14:38.845
OF DEADLY RADIATION.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.480
BUT LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE--

14:40.547 --> 14:42.649
SOON YOU'LL BE
YOUR OWN NIGHT LIGHT.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.221
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
MY NUCLEAR NYMPH?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
I HAVE TO
WARN MY FAMILY.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.525
BESIDES, YOURS
IS NOT THE LAST FACE
I WANT TO SEE.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.633
LET'S TALK
HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.235
YOUR HOME IS
A BIG INVESTMENT,

15:02.302 --> 15:04.604
AND IT NEEDS
BIG PROTECTION.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.476
REUBEN, WE'RE ALREADY
COVERED FOR FIRE, FLOOD,

15:09.542 --> 15:11.044
LOCUSTS, MOSQUITOES--

15:11.111 --> 15:13.213
HOW ABOUT TORNADOES?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.220
MOM! DAD!

15:20.287 --> 15:23.023
URKEL BUILT AN ATOM BOMB
THAT'S ABOUT TO GO OFF!

15:23.090 --> 15:25.792
CARL, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT LAURA.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.428
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN
STUDYING TOO HARD.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.697
YEAH, SHE'S SNAPPED.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.333
I HAVEN'T SNAPPED.
URKEL DID BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.002
AND IT IS ABOUT TO GO OFF..

15:35.068 --> 15:37.570
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE OUR STEVE.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.108
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY FAULT.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.675
I PUT HIM UP TO IT.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.044
[GASP] [GASP]
[GASP]

15:47.480 --> 15:49.882
DO YOU SEE WHAT
YOUR DAUGHTER HAS DONE?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.318
OH, SURE.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.186
SHE MAKES THE HONOR ROLL,
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.289
SHE BLOWS UP THE WORLD,
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.659
THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.761
YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR...

16:01.828 --> 16:03.330
WHEN IS THE BOMB
GOING OFF?

16:03.396 --> 16:04.497
FIVE MINUTES!

16:04.564 --> 16:05.532
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.935
NOW, GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND STAY THERE

16:09.002 --> 16:10.703
UNTIL YOU'RE BLOWN
OUT OF IT.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.707
YOU GUYS,
WE'RE GOING TO DIE!

16:14.774 --> 16:16.043
WELL, THAT'S LIFE.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.245
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.113
RIDING HIGH
IN APRIL,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.614
BLOWN UP IN MAY.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.773
EDDIE, HANG UP.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.077
FORGET IT, LAURA.
I'M ON THE PHONE WITH JALINE.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.346
SHE THINKS I'M CUTER
THAN FRESH PRINCE.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.483
I NEED THE PHONE.
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.618
SO IS THIS.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.420
I DON'T HAVE A DATE
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.523
THERE WONT BE A SATURDAY NIGHT
IF I DON'T GET THAT PHONE.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.192
GET OFF OF ME.
LET ME GO.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.777
HELLO, LAURA.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.148
AUNT RACHEL?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.450
SO, YOU USED STEVE,

18:03.516 --> 18:06.286
AND NOW HE'S GOING TO
BLOW US ALL UP.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.456
HOW CAN YOU BE AN ANGEL WHEN THE
BOMB HASN'T EXPLODED YET?

18:09.522 --> 18:13.293
OH, LAURA, WHY WAIT
TILL THE LAST MINUTE?

18:13.360 --> 18:17.330
BESIDES, I WANT
TO LOOK MY BEST
FOR SAINT PETER.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.166
AUNT RACHEL,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.302
YOU SAID IF I USED STEVE,
IT BLEW UP IN MY FACE.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.036
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
WELL, SURE, I CAN,

18:26.005 --> 18:28.308
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT SAINT PETER.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.877
AFTER ALL,
DESTROYING CHICAGO
WON'T LOOK GOOD

18:30.943 --> 18:32.345

PERMANENT RECORD.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.549

18:40.019 --> 18:41.654
I'M SO SORRY.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.990
I'M SO SORRY.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.196
2...1.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.470
DID I DO THAT?

19:02.175 --> 19:04.944
I'M SO SORRY.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.046
I'M SO SORRY.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.815
SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.290

I'M ALIVE!

19:35.908 --> 19:37.143
YOU'RE ALIVE!

19:37.210 --> 19:38.911
OH, CALM DOWN, LAURA.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.880
YOU WERE JUST HAVING
A NIGHTMARE.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.484
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.919
YOU BUILT AN ATOM BOMB
FOR OUR SCIENCE PROJECT.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.289
MR. NAGY
WAS SELLING INSURANCE.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.925
MY PARENTS
WERE SINGING OFF-KEY.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.527
AND THEN
WE BLEW UP CHICAGO.

19:54.594 --> 19:58.231
WELL, GEE, LAURA,
I'D NEVER BUILD
AN ATOM BOMB.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.832
ALTHOUGH I COULD.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.505
STEVE, SIT DOWN.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.844
LOOK, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.180
THE ONLY REASON I ASKED
YOU TO BE MY PARTNER

20:14.247 --> 20:16.549
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT MY GRADE.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.719
WHEN I SAID MY FEELINGS
FOR YOU MIGHT CHANGE, I LIED,

20:19.786 --> 20:20.820
AND I'M SORRY.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.525
SO YOU USED ME.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.030
YOU TRIFLED
WITH MY EMOTIONS.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.465
I OFFERED YOU MY HEART,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.967
AND YOU STOMPED
THAT SUCKER FLAT!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.239
YES.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.276
NO BIGGIE.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.778
WHAT?

20:45.845 --> 20:48.515
WELL, YOU 'FESSED UP.
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.984
YOUR HONESTY ONLY
MAKES ME LOVE YOU MORE.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.887
SO WILL YOU STILL
BE MY PARTNER?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.256
HEY, YOU BET, MY PET.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.559
THANKS, STEVE.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.330
HOLD IT.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.132
A FEW MINUTES AGO,
WAS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.368
OR DID YOU ACTUALLY
HUG ME?

21:08.435 --> 21:09.736
I HUGGED YOU.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.404

21:30.657 --> 21:32.759
WOW.
WOW. OH, STEVE.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.793
THAT'S NEAT!

21:33.860 --> 21:34.827
IT LOOKS REAL.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.429
OF COURSE IT'S REAL.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.130
THE LAURA HAS
A PERFECTLY CALIBRATED

21:40.166 --> 21:42.402

TO THE MOON AND BACK.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.504
WELL, HOP ON
AND TAKE OFF.

21:44.571 --> 21:48.007
YOU COULD BE THE FIRST
URKEL IN SPACE.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.642
YEAH, MAKE IT FLY.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.211

IN THE HOUSE.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.381
NOT TO WORRY, WINSLOWS.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.948
THE LAURA
CAN ONLY BE LAUNCHED

21:56.015 --> 21:57.450
BY PUNCHING IN
A COMPLICATED SERIES

21:57.517 --> 21:59.419
