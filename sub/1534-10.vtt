What's this? What is this called?

11:12.981 --> 11:13.599
An arrow.

11:13.624 --> 11:15.392
Yes. And where does this go?

11:15.417 --> 11:16.817
Flight.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.360
[Whispers] Flight, yeah. Stay right there.

11:19.621 --> 11:21.321
- Regina.
- It's happening.

11:21.355 --> 11:23.423
You and your men need to scatter.

11:23.457 --> 11:25.322
All together like this
with all these weapons?

11:25.347 --> 11:28.116
You'll kill each other once the spell hits.

11:28.262 --> 11:31.062
Will! Will Scarlet!

11:32.100 --> 11:33.834
There's no need to yell.
I'm just here, Robin.

11:33.868 --> 11:35.702
Emergency. Break camp.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.671
Right then. Come on, little man.

11:37.705 --> 11:40.741
Why don't you help?

11:44.478 --> 11:46.546
What?

11:46.580 --> 11:48.948
Is there something else?

11:50.351 --> 11:52.752
No. I'm just trying to
memorize you like this.

11:52.786 --> 11:54.854
Like what? Nervous and alarmed?

11:54.888 --> 11:57.923
No, with love in your eyes.

11:57.958 --> 12:01.260
I told you what this spell is going to do.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.847
- Maybe it won't.
- It will.

12:04.798 --> 12:09.068
The only people who
believe in me in this town

12:09.102 --> 12:11.737
are Henry and you.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.806
The thought of you looking at me

12:13.840 --> 12:16.875
the way everyone else does, with...

12:16.909 --> 12:19.178
with hatred...

12:19.212 --> 12:20.745
[Groans] That just might kill me.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.315
Stop thinking.

12:23.349 --> 12:25.083
We're here now,

12:25.117 --> 12:26.885
and this is true.

12:37.063 --> 12:39.998
[Door bells jingle]

12:40.032 --> 12:42.200
[Door closes] Okay.

12:42.234 --> 12:44.135
Here you go.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.303
Ha!

12:45.337 --> 12:46.470
Is it supposed to do that?

12:46.505 --> 12:47.738
Yeah. I know this spell.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.173
It gets brighter as you
get closer to your goal.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.175
It's how my parents found each other.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.544
<i>[Humming]</i>

12:53.579 --> 12:55.479
Did you see that? That
means it found her, right?

12:55.514 --> 12:57.295
- She's out there?
- How about... yeah.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.487
Come on. Don't stand
here. Let's keep going.

13:00.385 --> 13:03.387
<i>[Continues humming]</i>

13:05.990 --> 13:07.657
The library?

13:07.692 --> 13:10.035
But I've been inside before,
and Anna wasn't there.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.995
The library's... well, a funny place.

13:12.029 --> 13:14.164
There are all these tunnels underneath.

13:14.198 --> 13:15.499
You think she could be down there?

13:15.533 --> 13:18.235
Regina kept a whole dragon
under there for 28 years.

13:18.269 --> 13:20.437
I'm sure you can fit a small princess, too.

13:20.471 --> 13:24.206
Yes. Frozen by the Snow Queen.
That's why we never found Anna.

13:24.241 --> 13:25.908
But now we will.

13:26.944 --> 13:29.112
Anna: Wait! Stop! Too much running!

13:29.146 --> 13:31.376
[Both panting]

13:31.401 --> 13:33.169
[Coughs] Okay.

13:33.194 --> 13:34.860
I don't hear eight enormous feet,

13:34.885 --> 13:35.845
so I think we lost them.

13:35.870 --> 13:38.738
Great. So now we just
need to get that urn back.

13:39.123 --> 13:40.123
Call me crazy,

13:40.148 --> 13:41.982
but I really don't want
to face an evil wizard.

13:42.007 --> 13:44.374
I never said "evil."

13:44.761 --> 13:48.631
I mean, he is, but...
[Gasps] Oh! I have a plan.

13:48.665 --> 13:51.075
<i>Right before I left, I read mother's diary.</i>

13:51.100 --> 13:52.767
The one Elsa found, looking for clues.

13:52.935 --> 13:54.469
There was something they were looking for

13:54.503 --> 13:55.904
called a wishing star.

13:55.938 --> 13:58.216
- What's that?
- I have no idea.

13:58.241 --> 14:00.509
But the important thing
is, you can wish on it.

14:01.481 --> 14:04.196
I'm sure they were gonna
use it to take Elsa's power.

14:04.346 --> 14:07.535
But maybe we can use it
to wish Elsa back to us.

14:07.885 --> 14:09.752
Well, obviously they never got it

14:09.784 --> 14:11.269
because... Elsa... Powers...

14:11.294 --> 14:14.362
Right. They tracked it to
a pirate named Blackbeard.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.088
<i>But there's no record
they ever met with him,</i>

14:16.113 --> 14:17.177
but we can.

14:17.202 --> 14:21.005
Ohh. So my choices are
evil wizard or pirate?

14:21.096 --> 14:22.930
Pirates are better than wizards.

14:23.003 --> 14:25.689
- Says who?
- You can pay off pirates.

14:25.714 --> 14:26.642
[Laughs]

14:26.667 --> 14:28.712
You and I are rich in many ways,

14:28.737 --> 14:31.171
but the thing we're richest in is riches.

14:31.206 --> 14:33.340
So let's take the power
of the royal treasury

14:33.374 --> 14:36.944
and go buy ourselves a wishing thing.

14:36.979 --> 14:41.348
We can use it to rescue Elsa,
and she can save Arendelle.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.688
<i>[Continues humming]</i>

14:48.723 --> 14:50.924
It's brighter.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.126
There.

14:55.696 --> 14:57.864
There!

14:57.898 --> 14:59.333
<i>What?</i>

14:59.367 --> 15:03.136
No. How can there be a barrier?
Look how bright the glow is.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.505
She must be practically
right on the other side.

15:05.539 --> 15:08.074
Anna, are you there?

15:08.109 --> 15:10.744
Look at this dust. It just recently fell.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.912
All the new ice spiking and earth shaking

15:12.947 --> 15:15.248
that the Snow Queen's been
doing must've caused it.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.982
I can move this.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.551
No, Elsa, stop.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.419
As much as I enjoyed our last cave-in,

15:20.454 --> 15:22.622
I don't wanna do it again.
But she's right there!

15:22.656 --> 15:24.056
Then we'll find another way.

15:28.049 --> 15:29.875
Anna: That was the slowest boat ride ever.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.735
- [Groans] Oh.
- That must be Blackbeard's ship.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.297
Okay, now we need to find a crewman

15:36.322 --> 15:38.366
and tell him we wanna meet with Blackbeard

15:38.391 --> 15:39.869
because he has something we're
willing to pay anything for.

15:39.894 --> 15:40.455
Right.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.203
Ah, someone is playing my song.

15:44.496 --> 15:47.365
[Chuckles]

15:47.399 --> 15:50.167
I'm Captain Blackbeard.

15:51.558 --> 15:53.092
Come on board.

15:55.710 --> 15:57.778
I'm trying to find my sister,

15:57.803 --> 16:00.522
and you have a certain sculpture
that can help me do that.

16:00.639 --> 16:02.305
And... and we wanna buy it.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.074
Sculptur...

16:04.106 --> 16:05.205
The Wishing Star?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.563
Ah, yes.

16:07.752 --> 16:10.187
The Wishing Star.

16:10.508 --> 16:13.009
For the right price, it's yours.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.843
And... and what is the right price?

16:19.626 --> 16:22.995
My weight in gold.

16:23.936 --> 16:25.626
So...

16:25.651 --> 16:28.519
If it's not delicate,
how much... Tonnage?

16:28.544 --> 16:29.878
What would you say you weigh, Sir?

16:31.016 --> 16:33.223
Oh, never mind. It's fine.

16:33.248 --> 16:36.283
Sold! I mean, bought.

16:36.602 --> 16:39.160
[Lowered voice] See? Look,
things are going so nicely.

16:39.185 --> 16:40.676
I told you if we just keep the faith,

16:40.701 --> 16:42.639
- everything's gonna work out.
- And I told you that

16:42.664 --> 16:44.195
pirates were easier to
deal with than wizards.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.587
Hey, I told you that.

16:45.862 --> 16:48.364
And no one asked me at all.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.367
He did it again.

16:52.392 --> 16:53.860
[Laughter]

16:54.242 --> 16:56.410
Sure, me and the guys can clear the tunnel.

16:56.435 --> 16:58.606
- [Cell phone ringing]
- We'll have to work careful, but we can do it.

16:58.631 --> 16:59.798
Let's go now.

16:59.944 --> 17:01.405
[Ring] David: Excuse me.

17:01.430 --> 17:02.546
Look at this mess.

17:02.571 --> 17:04.772
A good mayor checks that these
things are kept up to code.

17:04.798 --> 17:06.198
Yeah, well, if the mayor

17:06.223 --> 17:08.457
<i>only has to worry about one
villain, and it's herself,</i>

17:08.482 --> 17:10.791
that frees up a lot of
time for infrastructure.

17:10.817 --> 17:12.117
I've had other issues.

17:12.192 --> 17:14.089
Leroy, how long to clear the passage?

17:14.121 --> 17:15.651
Couple of hours, maybe.
We can get right on it.

17:15.685 --> 17:16.818
That's wonderful.

17:16.853 --> 17:18.079
We don't have a couple hours.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.371
Have you guys not been watching the clock?

17:19.396 --> 17:21.352
It'll be sundown before
you munchkins finish.

17:21.377 --> 17:23.544
- Dwarfs, sister.
- Like I care.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.085
Let's just blast through and take the risk.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.411
That was Belle over at the diner.

17:27.435 --> 17:28.870
It turns out they can
possibly make the counterspell

17:28.895 --> 17:30.696
even if we don't find Anna.

17:30.721 --> 17:32.455
They can pull the mirror
dust out of the necklace

17:32.480 --> 17:34.247
- and try to use that.
- It's exactly the same?

17:34.446 --> 17:35.579
Almost. It'll take a little longer.

17:35.604 --> 17:38.506
The process is difficult and...

17:38.531 --> 17:40.866
It will destroy the necklace.

17:41.076 --> 17:44.587
<i>So the necklace can either
save all of us or Anna.</i>

17:44.612 --> 17:46.814
No. It can do both. We have time.

17:46.839 --> 17:48.006
<i>We don't.</i>

17:48.031 --> 17:49.698
Exploring these tunnels could take days.

17:49.821 --> 17:51.154
Leroy: So what'll it be, folks?

17:51.179 --> 17:54.047
Save the town or find the sister?

18:02.282 --> 18:03.750
Go around the back and wait.

18:07.268 --> 18:09.603
You'll know when you're needed.

18:16.244 --> 18:17.377
[Door bells jingle]

[Liquid bubbling]

18:18.940 --> 18:20.107
<i>What do you want?</i>

18:20.132 --> 18:21.933
Excuse me, but I'd like to borrow my wife.

18:23.851 --> 18:26.586
Gold: I need her at the
shop for a short while.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.189
Mother Superior: She's
working. We need her.

18:29.223 --> 18:30.724
Belle: Mother Superior's right.

18:30.758 --> 18:32.458
This is too important.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.197
Of course.

18:37.231 --> 18:40.381
Well, until you can go, I'll just, uh...

18:40.406 --> 18:42.740
I'll just keep you company.

18:42.765 --> 18:43.932
Perhaps I'll be helpful.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.320
This is light magic, dark one.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.146
Well, then maybe I'll learn something.

18:54.836 --> 18:57.237
<i>[Humming]</i>

18:57.262 --> 18:59.663
[Lowered voice] This shouldn't
even be a conversation.

18:59.688 --> 19:01.782
If we don't get the necklace
to the fairies right now,

19:01.864 --> 19:05.400
we and all our loved ones will
be hit by this vicious spell.

19:05.425 --> 19:07.493
It's one woman's life versus a whole town.

19:07.518 --> 19:08.786
Emma: Maybe we just haven't found an option

19:08.811 --> 19:10.078
where we don't have to lose anyone.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.067
Mm, you're talking like a hero.

19:12.092 --> 19:15.060
Yes, like all you charmings always do.

19:15.085 --> 19:17.553
But right now that's not your job.

19:17.770 --> 19:20.114
You're more than heroes.

19:20.139 --> 19:21.440
You're leaders,

19:21.465 --> 19:23.799
which means making the tough choice

19:23.824 --> 19:27.061
where someone has to lose,
and you have to say who.

19:28.775 --> 19:31.909
I agree with Regina. You're right.

19:33.561 --> 19:34.962
Yeah, I heard it, too.

19:34.987 --> 19:36.787
We need to do what's
best for the most people.

19:36.812 --> 19:38.873
We need to give this town its best chance.

19:38.946 --> 19:40.246
I'm so sorry,

19:40.271 --> 19:41.872
but we have to let the
fairies destroy that necklace.

The necklace. Do you have it?

- What?
- Where is it?

20:37.028 --> 20:38.262
She tricked us so she can
use it... [sighs deeply]

20:38.296 --> 20:40.397
To keep tracking down her damn sister!

20:40.432 --> 20:43.072
I should know better than
to trust blondes by now.

20:43.097 --> 20:44.314
We should go back and get it.

20:44.339 --> 20:46.012
No, it's... it's too late.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.471
Too late? Already?!

20:47.505 --> 20:49.806
By the time you get back here, yes.

20:49.841 --> 20:52.542
Without Anna being here physically,

20:52.576 --> 20:55.212
there's no way to make
a counterspell in time.

Time for a hope speech?

20:58.682 --> 20:59.816
Well, it seems Elsa's blind faith

is exactly what's screwing us right now.

21:01.585 --> 21:04.221
Coming from you, that's just terrifying.

21:04.255 --> 21:05.889
Well, I'm not giving up.

21:05.923 --> 21:07.790
I know she's down in the
mines looking for Anna.

21:07.824 --> 21:09.726
I'm gonna go help Elsa find her.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.961
Well, then go, because right
now that's our only shot.

isn't always perfect.

So even though it's still glowing,

because she's not here, it means...

22:07.950 --> 22:09.818
The search is over.

22:09.852 --> 22:12.353
30 years is a long time.

22:13.855 --> 22:16.089
You think something's happened to her,

22:16.124 --> 22:17.891
and this has all been a mistake?

22:17.926 --> 22:19.059
I think we need to deal

22:19.093 --> 22:20.761
with the problem in front of us right now.

22:20.796 --> 22:21.995
I'm sorry.

22:27.536 --> 22:28.936
How do you keep doing that?

22:28.970 --> 22:31.138
You didn't exactly leave inconspicuously.

22:31.172 --> 22:33.406
A paid informant on the docks in Arendelle

22:33.431 --> 22:34.839
and the swiftest ship
in the Navy got us here

22:34.864 --> 22:36.374
just in time.

22:39.113 --> 22:41.215
This was a trap?

22:43.218 --> 22:45.319
We have a deal! Something about...

22:45.353 --> 22:48.788
What, well over 200 pounds of gold.

22:48.823 --> 22:51.123
[Laughs]

22:51.158 --> 22:53.326
You know, when you're angry,

22:53.361 --> 22:55.962
you look so much like your mother.

22:55.996 --> 22:57.897
Wait.

22:57.931 --> 22:59.733
You met my mother?

22:59.767 --> 23:01.668
And your dear papa as well.

23:01.702 --> 23:04.737
A very regal couple.

23:04.771 --> 23:07.106
The fact they thought I
wouldn't recognize royalty

23:07.140 --> 23:09.608
was charmingly naive of them.

23:09.642 --> 23:11.344
Honestly, I liked them.

23:11.378 --> 23:14.313
Sold them the star at cost, actually.

23:14.348 --> 23:16.048
The Wishing Star?

23:16.083 --> 23:18.150
That doesn't make sense. If they had it,

23:18.185 --> 23:20.684
they would've used it to
take away Elsa's magic.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.143
Oh, well, perhaps they didn't know

23:22.168 --> 23:24.670
that the Wishing Star can
only be used by those with...

23:24.824 --> 23:27.402
Pure hearts.

23:28.495 --> 23:32.230
Well, if there's another
one, we're still interested,

23:32.265 --> 23:34.433
and we can pay just as much as he can.

23:34.467 --> 23:35.566
Hans: Can you?

23:35.601 --> 23:36.868
Because my brothers and I spent Wednesday

23:36.903 --> 23:38.904
rolling around on the
money in the royal treasury.

23:38.938 --> 23:40.105
[Laughter]

23:40.139 --> 23:43.308
You rolled around in gold bars?

23:43.342 --> 23:45.843
Weird. And ouch.

23:45.878 --> 23:49.047
Figure of speech. We reveled in it.

23:49.081 --> 23:51.949
The point is, it's now
in my control, not yours.

23:51.983 --> 23:53.384
You're what they call penniless.

23:53.419 --> 23:56.253
But, uh, that doesn't matter,

23:56.288 --> 23:58.923
because where you're
going, you don't need money.

23:58.957 --> 24:01.025
Where is that?

24:02.994 --> 24:04.429
Death.

24:04.463 --> 24:07.064
I'm not sure that's a place.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.600
Well, you're both about to find out.

24:10.635 --> 24:12.069
[Blades zing]

24:20.561 --> 24:23.738
This is the treacherous area
known as Poseidon's boneyard...

24:23.763 --> 24:27.066
the exact spot where your
parents' ship went down.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.368
How fitting that mother and daughter

24:29.402 --> 24:32.204
will have their last
regrets in the same place.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.472
Will you both die,

24:33.506 --> 24:35.974
wishing you'd never tried
to help your freak sister?

24:36.008 --> 24:37.876
Well...

24:37.910 --> 24:40.344
Maybe your bones will
mingle with your mother's

24:40.379 --> 24:43.281
on the bottom of the sea.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.950
Bring forward the trunk!

24:52.824 --> 24:54.192
There's a trunk?

24:54.226 --> 24:56.127
How... how will their bones
mingle if she's in a trunk?

24:56.161 --> 24:59.130
I once had a rival who
made me walk the plank.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.568
And much to my surprise,
I was saved by a mermaid.

25:03.602 --> 25:04.935
I applied the lesson.

25:04.970 --> 25:09.306
This trunk will make sure you
die without "finterference."

25:09.340 --> 25:12.509
[Laughter]

25:12.543 --> 25:14.311
Elsa's gonna get out of that urn,

25:14.345 --> 25:16.413
and when she does, she's
gonna take back the kingdom

25:16.447 --> 25:18.816
and kick you and your brothers
back to the Southern isles,

25:18.850 --> 25:21.885
which sounds lovelier
than I bet it actually is.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.053
[Thud] Uhh!

25:23.088 --> 25:24.421
I doubt that.

25:24.455 --> 25:26.223
I control the Royal Navy,

25:26.257 --> 25:27.790
<i>the Vast Armies,</i>

25:27.825 --> 25:30.226
<i>and even this Enchanted Ship
you're about to be thrown off...</i>

25:30.260 --> 25:31.460
the Jolly Roger.

25:31.495 --> 25:33.663
And if Elsa hasn't found
a way to escape an urn

25:33.697 --> 25:35.531
in the last 30 years,

25:35.565 --> 25:36.699
I doubt she ever will.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.768
Wait. What? 30 years?

25:38.802 --> 25:40.036
The spell that froze Arendelle,

25:40.070 --> 25:42.639
it had us all frozen for 30 years.

25:42.673 --> 25:45.608
My aunt kept us like that for decades?

25:45.642 --> 25:47.409
Elsa. My poor sister.

25:47.444 --> 25:49.311
She was stuck in an urn all that time!

25:49.346 --> 25:51.180
Why would Ingrid unfreeze us all right now?

25:51.214 --> 25:52.648
Because she wants to do something worse.

25:52.682 --> 25:53.849
We have to get to Elsa.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.951
We have to stop whatever
it is Ingrid... aah!

25:55.985 --> 25:57.253
- She's so talky.
- [Laughter]

25:57.287 --> 25:59.421
- [Pounding in trunk]
- Men!

26:01.724 --> 26:03.191
[Men grunt]

26:03.225 --> 26:05.127
[Water splashes]

26:05.161 --> 26:06.862
[Laughs]

26:12.468 --> 26:14.335
I'm sorry, Emma, but I still have faith.

26:14.370 --> 26:17.172
I still believe she's...

26:18.541 --> 26:19.674
What?

26:19.708 --> 26:21.976
It stopped glowing.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.479
I'm sorry.

26:24.513 --> 26:28.550
[Voice breaks] She's really gone.

26:34.890 --> 26:36.757
[Grunting]

26:36.792 --> 26:38.993
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

26:39.027 --> 26:40.294
There's a nail back there.

26:40.328 --> 26:42.697
Okay, I think I can get through the ropes.

26:44.632 --> 26:46.667
Help!

26:46.702 --> 26:49.036
Help!

26:50.672 --> 26:54.774
This was my present for
Anna for her wedding.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.636
It was among my mother's
things, but to us, it was new.

27:00.781 --> 27:03.483
And I turned it into the
last gift I ever gave her.

27:03.518 --> 27:06.553
Elsa, I'm so sorry,

27:06.588 --> 27:08.054
but it's almost sundown.

27:08.089 --> 27:11.124
[Thunder rumbling, wind whistling]

27:11.158 --> 27:13.226
That cloud is gonna hit any time.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.627
We have to go. Everyone's
gonna turn on each other,

27:14.661 --> 27:16.295
and something tells me that
being immune to the curse

27:16.330 --> 27:18.297
is not gonna stop them from attacking us.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.299
I failed. I deserve to be attacked.

27:21.802 --> 27:23.402
This...

27:23.437 --> 27:25.871
[Crying] This is all I have left of Anna.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.807
Now I'll never know what happened to her.

27:31.211 --> 27:35.281
Come on. Come on!

[Laughs]

27:44.057 --> 27:46.792
Oh! Look! Look!

27:46.826 --> 27:50.195
I got my hands out. Okay, I'm
gonna untie you. All right?

27:50.230 --> 27:52.030
Okay, come here. Come on.

27:52.065 --> 27:55.033

[Crying] I, Anna of Arendelle,

28:15.788 --> 28:18.089
promise to love and cherish you.

28:18.123 --> 28:20.258
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

28:20.292 --> 28:22.359
Marrying you before we die.

28:24.429 --> 28:26.397
- No.
- What?

28:26.431 --> 28:30.134
You don't get to marry me
unless we get out of this.

28:30.169 --> 28:33.170
Okay? Just keep your
chin up and breathe. Okay?

28:39.377 --> 28:42.245
Anna, wherever you are,

28:42.280 --> 28:44.682
whatever happened to
you all those years ago,

28:44.716 --> 28:47.150
I'm so sorry I didn't find you.

28:47.185 --> 28:51.554
I still have faith. I know
you're out there somewhere.

28:51.588 --> 28:53.723
I won't give up hope.

28:53.757 --> 28:55.892
I just wish...

28:55.927 --> 28:58.061
I wish you were with me now.

- Anna! Oh! I couldn't find you!
- I was looking for you!

- I put you in an urn!
- You missed your wedding!

- It's okay! We're here!
- But you're still young!

30:23.945 --> 30:25.446
- We were frozen!

How did you get here?!

It's like you wished it.

It was the Wishing Star!

30:35.656 --> 30:38.158

30:38.192 --> 30:41.061
But it is a cold miracle,
and we're all wet, so...

30:41.095 --> 30:43.430
Yes. If we can get Anna back
to the fairies right away,

31:16.049 --> 31:17.615
Well, perhaps.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.141
But, uh, if there's one thing I've learned,

31:19.175 --> 31:21.039
it's never trust a fairy.

Go inside and stay in the back room.

But by morning, all should be complete,

34:35.264 --> 34:37.533
including your life.

34:37.567 --> 34:39.801
Now run along, dearie,

34:39.835 --> 34:43.672
and enjoy your last
day in this or any land.

34:48.945 --> 34:51.713
Mom, dad, we're running out of
time. You said you had a plan.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.882
- Kristoff?
- David?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.250
You cut your hair.

34:55.284 --> 34:56.684
So did you you!

34:56.717 --> 34:58.019
[Both laugh]

34:58.054 --> 35:02.223
I see you brought your
lovely fiancée. Joan?

35:02.258 --> 35:04.892
- Joan?
- It was a... code name.

35:04.927 --> 35:06.561
David, I like you short hair.

35:06.595 --> 35:09.830
Not that I didn't like it long
or that I thought it was...

35:09.865 --> 35:11.332
It's good to see you.

35:11.367 --> 35:12.567
Likewise. [Chuckles]

35:12.601 --> 35:15.235
This is my wife Snow, our son Neal,

35:15.270 --> 35:17.672
and our daughter Emma.

35:17.706 --> 35:19.473
Wait. What? How can she be your daughter?

35:19.507 --> 35:20.841
It's a long story. Once
we survive this curse,

35:20.876 --> 35:22.577
I'll be happy to tell you all about it.

35:22.611 --> 35:24.445
The plan. What's the plan?

35:28.249 --> 35:30.484
- [Keys jangle]
- This is the plan.

35:30.518 --> 35:31.751
What?

35:31.786 --> 35:33.253
You and Anna and Elsa
are the only ones immune,

35:33.288 --> 35:34.888
so the rest of us need
to protect ourselves.

35:34.922 --> 35:37.324
You might wanna try that desk, old friend.

35:37.358 --> 35:39.526
It's sturdy. Cuff keys
are in the top drawer.

35:43.231 --> 35:45.832
- I'm not locking you in there.
- Yes, you have to.

35:45.866 --> 35:47.533
We won't be able to
hurt anyone from in here.

35:47.568 --> 35:48.835
Take the keys, Emma.

35:48.869 --> 35:51.504
[Clicking]

35:51.538 --> 35:52.772
I don't know what's gonna happen.

35:52.807 --> 35:54.240
I don't know how long it's gonna last.

35:54.274 --> 35:55.609
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.

35:55.643 --> 35:57.543
I mean, what if... what if
you starve to death in there?

35:57.578 --> 35:58.778
No, Emma, you're gonna fix this thing,

35:58.813 --> 36:00.614
and then you're gonna
come back and save us.

36:00.648 --> 36:02.881
You think?

36:02.916 --> 36:05.151
We believe in you.

36:06.786 --> 36:08.554
Please.

36:12.759 --> 36:14.760
Now you know Henry's in a safe place,

36:14.794 --> 36:16.762
and Regina and the others
can take care of themselves.

36:16.796 --> 36:18.063
[Cell door clanks]

36:18.098 --> 36:19.498
[Key turns]

36:19.532 --> 36:21.066
What about the baby?

36:21.101 --> 36:23.468
No, don't worry. Neal won't be with us.

36:23.503 --> 36:25.570
- [Neal fusses]
- Who's gonna take him?

36:27.173 --> 36:28.306
[Whispers] You are.

36:28.341 --> 36:31.443
Oh.

36:31.477 --> 36:33.445
- [Exhales]
- [Door clanks]

36:33.479 --> 36:35.247
[Whispers] We don't fear your magic, Emma.

36:35.281 --> 36:39.213
It's what's gonna allow you to
take on the Snow Queen and win.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.739
And when you do, you'll be right
back here unlocking these doors.

36:41.987 --> 36:46.491
We trust you. And Henry's
right. You are special,

36:46.526 --> 36:48.926
and you are going to use that specialness

36:48.961 --> 36:51.763
and save both of you.

36:51.797 --> 36:53.798
[Thunder rumbling]

36:53.832 --> 36:55.867
You have wonderful parents, Emma.

36:57.469 --> 36:59.336
[Voice breaks] I know.

36:59.371 --> 37:03.340
Swan? A word.

37:05.077 --> 37:07.378
Elsa, can you hold my brother?

37:07.412 --> 37:09.313
Of course.

37:09.347 --> 37:10.514
[Whispers] It's okay.

37:20.091 --> 37:22.359
What are you doing here? You
know what's about to happen.

37:22.394 --> 37:24.795
Aye.

37:24.829 --> 37:26.697
I know. I just needed to see you.

37:26.731 --> 37:28.999
Before I chained myself to the dock

37:29.033 --> 37:32.268
for the protection of all, I...

37:32.303 --> 37:34.604
Needed to see you one more time.

37:34.638 --> 37:37.440
[Crying]

37:37.474 --> 37:41.544
Killian, I'm not... a
tearful goodbye kiss person.

37:43.046 --> 37:46.048
But maybe just this once.

37:52.289 --> 37:55.658
[Thunderclap]

37:55.693 --> 37:57.392
Goodbye.

37:57.427 --> 37:59.294
[Gasps]

38:01.231 --> 38:04.666
[Exhaling deeply]

38:06.669 --> 38:09.171
[Sniffles] Okay.

38:11.262 --> 38:12.802
[Thunder rumbling]

38:13.376 --> 38:15.043
Not long now.

38:17.580 --> 38:20.716
[Thunderclaps]

38:25.121 --> 38:28.557
Looks like one more adventure together.

38:33.595 --> 38:36.631
[Neal fussing]

38:36.665 --> 38:37.766
[Thunder rumbles]

38:37.800 --> 38:40.235
[Inhales deeply] Here it comes.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.574
[Door creaks]

38:46.608 --> 38:48.876
<i>Henry, I am so sorry.</i>

38:48.910 --> 38:50.944
I should have stayed focused
on Operation Mongoose,

38:50.979 --> 38:54.081
but Robin Hood... [sighs]

38:54.115 --> 38:56.651
I-I let my heart pull me elsewhere.

38:56.685 --> 38:58.852
Operation Mongoose is not over.

38:58.887 --> 39:01.889
<i>We're gonna find the
author. You will be happy.</i>

39:01.923 --> 39:05.358
First, we have to survive.

39:05.393 --> 39:07.194
Now listen to me carefully, Henry.

39:07.228 --> 39:09.830
I'm going to seal this place.

39:09.864 --> 39:11.765
You're going to be locked
in, but more importantly,

39:11.800 --> 39:15.202
everyone else will be locked out.

39:15.236 --> 39:17.104
I understand.

39:17.138 --> 39:19.006
Don't be scared.

39:19.048 --> 39:20.181
I'm not, mom.

39:20.207 --> 39:23.176
Emma and Elsa will fix this. I have faith.

39:23.210 --> 39:25.512
[Exhales deeply]

39:25.546 --> 39:28.981
I wish I was as brave as you.

39:29.016 --> 39:30.149
Now go.

39:30.184 --> 39:32.018
I'll be okay.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.488
[Thunder rumbles]

39:35.523 --> 39:37.990
Really, go.

39:38.025 --> 39:39.525
[Whispers] I love you.

39:39.559 --> 39:41.260
I love you, too.

39:47.634 --> 39:50.336
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

39:53.506 --> 39:55.808
Where to now?

39:55.842 --> 39:57.710
My vault.

39:57.744 --> 40:00.646
And you need to get as far
away from it as possible.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.782
- It's dangerous even being around each other now.
- [Electricity crackles]

40:03.817 --> 40:05.984
- We're moments away.
- It's okay.

40:06.018 --> 40:07.185
Roland and Marian are locked away

40:07.220 --> 40:08.654
somewhere even I don't know.

40:08.688 --> 40:10.488
Henry is safe in there.

40:10.522 --> 40:13.558
I'll go and chain myself
to a tree in a minute...

40:13.592 --> 40:14.926
Unless you want me to come with you.

40:14.961 --> 40:16.361
No, no, no, no, no.

40:16.395 --> 40:17.829
I need to seal myself in that vault.

40:17.864 --> 40:20.298
To keep people out?

40:20.333 --> 40:21.566
Oh, no.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.835
[Whispers] To keep me in.

40:23.870 --> 40:25.136
Regina, I'm not afraid of you.

40:25.171 --> 40:30.174
But you really...

40:30.208 --> 40:33.210
[Thunder rumbling]

40:40.252 --> 40:42.786
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

40:49.928 --> 40:51.061
Never let go.

40:51.096 --> 40:53.397
Hey. Don't be afraid.

40:53.431 --> 40:54.664
You know, we share a heart,

40:54.699 --> 40:56.867
and nothing can come between
two halves of one heart.

40:56.902 --> 40:58.935
These are just precautions.

40:58.969 --> 41:02.906
No spell is strong enough
to break what we have.

41:32.368 --> 41:36.338
[Thunderclaps]

41:40.844 --> 41:45.147
[Glass tinkling]

42:10.639 --> 42:14.375
