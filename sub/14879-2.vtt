♪ ♪

00:15.528 --> 00:17.363
Hey, where is everybody?

00:17.368 --> 00:18.964
The 2:30 jaywalk run-through.

00:19.032 --> 00:20.599
Yeah, but it's not
2:30 yet.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.032
That's 'cause
they moved it to 2:00.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.332
They sent a memo.

00:28.201 --> 00:29.735
Listen, I need
an update on Budapest.

00:29.803 --> 00:31.136
Sorry I'm late for--

00:31.204 --> 00:33.176
- Surprise!
- Hey, surprise!

00:33.244 --> 00:34.378
Happy Birthday!

00:34.445 --> 00:36.481
Wow! Uh...

00:36.549 --> 00:39.256
That is
totally unexpected.

00:39.324 --> 00:42.393
I'm at a complete loss
for what to say

00:42.460 --> 00:43.660
except that
it's not my birthday.

00:46.466 --> 00:48.868
But it will be
in about six days.

00:48.936 --> 00:50.905
How about we not quibble
over details

00:50.973 --> 00:53.308
and you make a wish?
I can't blow out the candle,

00:53.376 --> 00:55.610
not if it's not my actual
birthday,

00:55.678 --> 00:56.812
'cause it's bad luck.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.583
Does this mean no cake?

00:58.650 --> 01:00.718
Yes, cake.
Have at it.

01:00.786 --> 01:03.189
There you go again,
lighting up a room.

01:03.257 --> 01:05.257
So the sudden craving
for chai...

01:05.325 --> 01:06.627
- Subterfuge.
- Auggie,

01:06.695 --> 01:08.564
you are six whole days off.

01:08.632 --> 01:10.967
You don't need subterfuge.
You need a calendar.

01:11.035 --> 01:12.703
Oh.

01:12.771 --> 01:15.206
Unless...you know
some reason why

01:15.274 --> 01:17.376
I won't be here next week
to celebrate.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.314
Annie.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.084
A word in my office
when you're done here.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.423
Auggie...

01:36.364 --> 01:38.699
You're sending me to Paris?

01:38.767 --> 01:40.302
See? Now I'm already
having second thoughts.

01:40.369 --> 01:42.237
But you just gave me
the assignment.

01:42.304 --> 01:44.005
Yeah. But you've
got that look.

01:44.073 --> 01:46.440
Look? What look?

01:46.508 --> 01:48.142
The look that every
female operative gets

01:48.210 --> 01:49.777
the first time
I send her to Paris.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.078
Your pupils are dilating.

01:51.146 --> 01:52.814
Did you even hear
what your mission was?

01:52.881 --> 01:55.383
Yes! To cultivate
an asset in Paris.

01:55.451 --> 01:57.620
Her name is Salma Devrient.

01:57.688 --> 01:59.588
She was born and raised
in Clichy-sous-Bois.

01:59.656 --> 02:02.225
Her father is French.
Her mother is from Aleppo.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.761
She works for the Syrian embassy
as the social secretary.

02:04.829 --> 02:07.231
And we think she might be
vulnerable why?

02:07.299 --> 02:08.799
Because her fiance
of the past two years

02:08.866 --> 02:10.167
just broke up with her,

02:10.235 --> 02:11.301
and she is a week late
in her rent.

02:11.369 --> 02:13.838
Joan, look.
My pupils are fine.

02:13.906 --> 02:14.972
Okay.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.674
Do we think that the Syrians

02:16.742 --> 02:18.809
might be reconstituting
their weapons program?

02:18.877 --> 02:20.310
We think it would be helpful

02:20.378 --> 02:22.312
to have a friend inside
the embassy, nothing more.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.014
It's hard to believe
there isn't someone

02:24.081 --> 02:26.049
in the Paris station who's in
a better position to do that.

02:26.117 --> 02:27.717
Are you gonna make me
have third thoughts?

02:27.785 --> 02:29.919
'Cause there's plenty of people
who want to take this mission.

02:29.987 --> 02:31.654
No. Thank you.
I appreciate the opportunity.

02:31.722 --> 02:32.989
You've done some solid
work here, Annie,

02:33.057 --> 02:34.624
but at the end of the day,

02:34.692 --> 02:36.627
it's the cultivation
of intelligence assets

02:36.694 --> 02:39.063
that determines how successful
you are in the CIA.

02:39.131 --> 02:41.533
Assets like Salma.
I understand.

02:41.601 --> 02:43.769
Just go and use
your best judgment.

02:43.836 --> 02:45.838
And bring back receipts.

What have you learned?

03:33.155 --> 03:35.257
I've learned
she likes her routines.

03:35.324 --> 03:37.158
She's got a good eye
for accessories.

03:37.226 --> 03:40.562

03:59.082 --> 04:00.749
Stay focused,
find your in,

04:00.817 --> 04:02.684
and all will be fine.

04:04.487 --> 04:07.689
I think...
I have an opening.

04:09.659 --> 04:11.126
19th century portraits.

04:11.194 --> 04:12.728
You call that an opening?

04:14.865 --> 04:16.232
Got any good
conversation starters?

04:16.300 --> 04:18.101
Yeah, I do, actually,

04:18.168 --> 04:20.437
but they all require
that you not be able to see.

I don't want a postponement.

05:19.669 --> 05:20.803
You know, I can do that thing
with the guy

05:20.870 --> 05:22.271
with the strings getting pulled.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.840
- One phone call.
- It's my civic duty.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.642
Okay. But what if you
get stuck on some OJ-like trial?

05:27.710 --> 05:29.277
You could be sequestered
for weeks.

05:29.345 --> 05:30.645
I'm not gonna be sequestered,

05:30.713 --> 05:31.846

selected.

05:31.914 --> 05:32.947
You don't know that.

05:33.015 --> 05:34.650
If you were on trial,

05:34.717 --> 05:37.151
would you want me
on your jury?

05:37.219 --> 05:38.453
Can I take
the fifth on that one?

05:38.521 --> 05:40.588
I'll put everything together

05:40.656 --> 05:42.624
you'll need before I leave.

05:42.692 --> 05:43.958
Do we have a status on Annie?

05:44.026 --> 05:46.394
She's making
some real progress.

05:46.462 --> 05:48.563
So she hasn't
established contact.

05:48.631 --> 05:50.798
- She's getting super-close.
- Let's read her in

05:50.866 --> 05:52.733
on the chatter
out of Damascus, okay?

05:52.801 --> 05:54.034
Maybe accelerate things
over there.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.503
I'll get right on it.

05:55.571 --> 05:58.372
I wouldn't feel comfortable
reporting for jury duty

05:58.440 --> 06:00.441
if I didn't trust you
to fill in, Auggie.

06:00.509 --> 06:02.877
You're gonna do fine
without me.

06:02.944 --> 06:04.311
Okay.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.193
Why didn't you just run her
down right there in the store?

06:51.261 --> 06:52.794
Because, Auggie,
it would have embarrassed her,

06:52.862 --> 06:54.297
confronting her
in public like that.

06:54.364 --> 06:56.265
I assume you staged
the dummy bag.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.803
Yeah. Tour guide, Metro map,
key to my hotel room.

07:00.871 --> 07:02.972
Smithsonian business cards.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.807
Hey, guys,
run a number for me.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.844
43-59-14-17.

07:07.912 --> 07:09.679
See if anything turns up.

07:09.746 --> 07:10.946
You sure she's gonna
call you back?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.149
Maybe she'll like
her new bag better.

07:13.216 --> 07:14.517
If worse comes to worse,
I'll call her later,

07:14.585 --> 07:17.286
but I want Salma to be the one
who reaches out.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.455
It's better
if she feels responsible.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.391
And what did it cost to lay
this Freudian trap of yours?

07:22.459 --> 07:23.892
6,000.

07:23.960 --> 07:24.893
6--

07:24.961 --> 07:27.963
6,000 Euros for a pocketbook?

07:28.031 --> 07:30.899
6 grand's not bad.
Full retail's closer to 7.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.302
Can you return it
when you're done

07:33.369 --> 07:35.204
or convert it into a condo?

07:35.272 --> 07:37.807
You're obviously
not a woman.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.343
Joan will understand
the underlying psychology.

07:40.411 --> 07:43.146
No.
Joan would not understand.

07:43.214 --> 07:45.715
Oh. Hey, Joan.

07:45.783 --> 07:48.585
Auggie,
little heads up next time.

07:48.652 --> 07:49.819
Hey, it's not like

07:49.887 --> 07:51.454
I'm the most difficult guy
to sneak up on.

07:51.522 --> 07:52.956
Annie, you do realize
we didn't send you to Paris

07:53.023 --> 07:54.324
to scout Fashion Week.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.892
Did you read her in yet?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.194
Read me in on what?

07:58.262 --> 07:59.596
There's been increased
chatter out of Damascus.

07:59.663 --> 08:02.198
We think Mahmoud Kanaan
is on the move.

08:02.266 --> 08:04.233
Chemical Kanaan's here?
In Paris?

08:04.301 --> 08:05.735
We don't know.
It'd be nice if you could

08:05.803 --> 08:08.104
stop shopping and help us
answer that question.

08:08.172 --> 08:10.740
Okay. Can I get something
to I.D. him with, a photo...

08:10.808 --> 08:12.109
We would if we could,
but we can't.

08:12.176 --> 08:13.844
Chemical Kanaan is a ghost.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.980
20 years flouting IAEA
nonproliferation sanctions,

08:17.047 --> 08:19.282
and we still don't know
what he looks like.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.184
Hold on.
That's my other line.

08:21.252 --> 08:24.988
Okay. I don't like
to use this term, but...

08:25.055 --> 08:28.358
If it helps keep anyone in line
while I'm out of pocket,

08:28.425 --> 08:30.593
you can say
you're in charge.

08:30.661 --> 08:31.594
What--he's in charge?

08:31.662 --> 08:33.462
Like I said.

08:33.530 --> 08:35.898
I promise not to abuse it.

08:51.081 --> 08:53.582
Devrient. It's okay
if you like to speak in English.

08:53.650 --> 08:55.284
Merci--I mean,
thank you.

08:55.351 --> 08:56.585
I'm so sorry for the mix-up.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.920
I didn't touch
anything inside.

08:58.988 --> 09:01.056
No. Of course not.
Neither did I.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.592
Couldn't help but wonder,
though, what you paid for it.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.929
Just feel like an idiot
who still pays full retail.

09:06.996 --> 09:08.297
I don't remember.

09:08.364 --> 09:10.398
Oh. Look at me being so rude.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.134
I don't even know you yet.

09:13.202 --> 09:14.636
I'm already asking
personal questions.

09:14.703 --> 09:17.605
Won't you please sit down?
I really should be going.

09:17.673 --> 09:20.808
Oh, please? I ordered this
whole bottle of wine by mistake.

09:20.876 --> 09:23.511
Verre...Bouteille.
I get so confused.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.714
You have to help me
finish it.

09:27.216 --> 09:29.151
I bought the bag
after my fiance left.

09:29.219 --> 09:30.820
I couldn't afford it,
really.

09:30.887 --> 09:32.488
But it makes you
feel better.

09:32.556 --> 09:35.391
We call that retail therapy
in the states.

09:35.459 --> 09:37.793
Retail therapy? Yes.
I like that.

09:37.861 --> 09:39.462
It works much better
than ice cream.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.331
At least until
your credit runs out.

09:42.399 --> 09:44.000
Yeah. You need
a better-paying job.

09:44.068 --> 09:45.468
Yeah. A better breed
of fiance.

09:45.536 --> 09:47.804
Sometimes the two
come hand-in-hand.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.709
I really should be going.

09:52.777 --> 09:55.979
They embassy will want me
to report my bag being missing.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.347
Oh, but you got it all
back in one piece.

09:57.415 --> 09:58.882
I know,
but they have their rules.

09:58.949 --> 10:01.851
They will want me to change
all the locks and passwords.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.619
I know this is really
last-minute,

10:03.687 --> 10:06.221
but I have to go to this
black tie event tonight.

10:06.289 --> 10:07.555
I don't want to go
by myself.

10:07.623 --> 10:09.658
It will be so boring.

10:09.726 --> 10:11.293
You want to go with me?
Tonight?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.794
Do you already have plans?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.830
Uh, no.

10:14.898 --> 10:17.232
I don't know.
I--

10:17.300 --> 10:19.468
I kind of met this man
yesterday.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.137
You little minx.
You work so fast.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.872
What's his name?
Where'd you meet him?

10:23.940 --> 10:26.274
His name is George.
But it's nothing, really.

10:26.342 --> 10:27.875
Not yet anyway.

10:27.943 --> 10:29.511
But he said he was
going to call.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.212
So you're gonna go home
and wait by the phone?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.047
Oh ho ho...

10:33.115 --> 10:34.982
Take it from me--

10:35.050 --> 10:37.452
you gotta play harder to get.

10:50.898 --> 10:53.433
Do you go to party like this
for work every night?

10:53.501 --> 10:55.336
Not every night.

10:55.403 --> 10:57.071
Oh, I need to find
the ladies' room.

10:57.138 --> 10:58.973
Oh. Okay. I'll meet you
right over there.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.074
Okay.

11:28.673 --> 11:30.174
And you didn't believe
in kismet?

11:30.241 --> 11:31.976

11:32.043 --> 11:33.845
<i>Bon soir.</i>

11:33.912 --> 11:35.446
<i>Bon soir.</i>

11:35.514 --> 11:37.382
Uh, this is, uh...

11:37.449 --> 11:38.683
A pleasant surprise,
I hope.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.219
It is. Very much so.

11:41.287 --> 11:43.622
Who knew you were
a patron of the arts?

11:43.690 --> 11:45.658
Well, what can I say?

11:45.725 --> 11:48.027
I like beautiful things.

11:49.563 --> 11:51.964
That tux does suit you.

11:52.032 --> 11:53.165
I'm contractually
obligated to wear it

11:53.232 --> 11:55.566
every time I'm in Paris.

11:55.634 --> 11:56.968
It's good for the image...

11:57.036 --> 11:58.736
of the city.
You seem distracted.

11:58.804 --> 12:00.638
Am I keeping you
from anything?

12:00.705 --> 12:02.172
You are, actually.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.642
You don't mind if we reschedule
this little reunion, do you?

12:05.710 --> 12:07.677
Enough said. I have business
to attend to myself.

12:07.745 --> 12:08.911
Thank you, Eyal.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.147
Let's consider it
a courtesy--

12:11.214 --> 12:13.516
one professional
to the other.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.185
By the way, that switch
you did with the bag...

12:16.253 --> 12:18.921
Excellent spycraft there.
Well played.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.489
And much more fashionable

12:20.557 --> 12:23.625
than that titanium thing
you lugged around Zurich.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.095
- How do you know--
- George?

12:34.070 --> 12:35.837
You two know each other?

12:35.905 --> 12:38.006
Remember that man
I told you about?

12:38.074 --> 12:41.075
The one I just met.
This is him.

12:42.444 --> 12:43.777
Pleasure to meet you.

12:43.845 --> 12:46.079
The pleasure's
all mine, George.

12:46.147 --> 12:48.448
Thank you so much
for bringing me with you.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.183
I feel like Cinderella.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.885
Ah.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.720
Perfect timing.

12:53.788 --> 12:55.522
Thank you so much.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.324
Shall we?

13:05.279 --> 13:06.787
It's surreal, isn't it?

13:06.788 --> 13:08.223
How small is the world.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.758
And you two have
so much in common.

13:09.826 --> 13:11.860
- Really?
- George exports antiquities

13:11.928 --> 13:13.396
out of Cyprus,

13:13.463 --> 13:15.832
and Annie represents
the Smithsonian Institute.

13:15.899 --> 13:19.302
Perhaps we should, uh,
talk later.

13:19.369 --> 13:21.837
Oh, we should definitely
talk later.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.107
How exactly
did you two meet?

13:24.174 --> 13:25.541
That's a funny story,

13:25.609 --> 13:27.811
because he was here
in the museum.

13:27.878 --> 13:30.046
Just yesterday.
Right here?

13:30.114 --> 13:33.083
It was actually, uh,
19th century portraits.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.085
Yes.

13:35.152 --> 13:36.953
I was by myself after work,

13:37.021 --> 13:40.022
and from out of nowhere,
George came in

13:40.090 --> 13:42.925
asking me how I felt about
the brush strokes.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.994
And before I knew it,

13:45.062 --> 13:46.863
we were spending
the next nine hours together.

13:46.931 --> 13:48.331
It's kismet.

13:48.399 --> 13:51.234
That's exactly
what George said!

13:51.302 --> 13:53.303
Did you hear that, George?

13:53.371 --> 13:55.739
I feel like dancing.
Would you care to dance?

13:55.807 --> 13:57.007
I would love to.

13:57.075 --> 13:58.675
Will you be okay
on your own, Annie?

13:58.743 --> 13:59.876
Oh, of course.

13:59.944 --> 14:01.878
Don't worry about me!

14:05.584 --> 14:07.051
Hey, what's up?

14:07.119 --> 14:08.819
We have a little problem.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.156
Your kid's home sick
from school,

14:13.224 --> 14:14.691
you've got a big powerpoint
presentation to make,

14:14.759 --> 14:16.560
your boss is on your ass.

14:16.628 --> 14:18.329
If any of you find
any of those excuses

14:18.396 --> 14:20.430
on the tips of your tongues,

14:20.498 --> 14:21.999
please leave them there.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.034
I've heard them all before.

14:24.102 --> 14:27.171
In a moment,
we will begin voir dire,

14:27.239 --> 14:28.906
which is the process
by which these attorneys

14:28.974 --> 14:31.977
will select or reject...
Hello?

14:32.044 --> 14:33.678
You okay to talk?

14:33.746 --> 14:36.281
Uh...
I'm okay to listen.

14:36.349 --> 14:37.816
Annie just called in
from Paris.

14:37.883 --> 14:39.117
Looks like Mossad's
after Salma too.

14:39.185 --> 14:40.585
They sent Eyal Leven.

14:40.653 --> 14:42.453
Uh-huh.

14:42.521 --> 14:44.822
I don't think they'd send him
on a fishing expedition,

14:44.889 --> 14:46.356
so they must have
a bead on something.

14:46.424 --> 14:48.225
Are we hearing
any chatter?

14:48.292 --> 14:49.626
What?

14:49.694 --> 14:50.727
Are we hearing any--

14:50.795 --> 14:52.729
chatter?

14:52.797 --> 14:54.965
No. Are you in
the courtroom now?

14:55.033 --> 14:56.466
Mm-hmm.

14:58.770 --> 15:01.271
The Israeli desk is checking
on the deconfliction protocol.

15:01.339 --> 15:02.772
I went ahead and set up
a line of credit

15:02.840 --> 15:06.075
with the clearing bank in case
Annie winds up in a bidding war.

15:06.143 --> 15:09.112
Okay. Well, just tell Annie
no more buying bags.

15:10.381 --> 15:11.549
- Did I hear something banging?
- No.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.984
Bags. No more buying bags.

15:14.052 --> 15:16.120
Juror number nine!

15:16.188 --> 15:18.155
Are we interrupting
your phone conversation?

15:18.223 --> 15:20.057
Uh...No.

15:20.125 --> 15:23.127
I--
no, your honor.

15:23.194 --> 15:25.295
We may proceed with voir dire.

15:25.363 --> 15:27.197
If I have your permission.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.234
Uh, yes, of course,
your honor.

15:31.536 --> 15:33.337
Voir dire away.

15:33.405 --> 15:34.838
Thank you, number nine.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.467
Uh...

16:10.976 --> 16:12.477
Lucky guess.

16:24.990 --> 16:26.791
I'm going to go
freshen up.

16:31.698 --> 16:33.732
So they have you seducing
secretaries now?

16:33.799 --> 16:37.268
And you with that tired
old line about kismet.

16:37.336 --> 16:39.204
You're upset.
I get that.

16:39.272 --> 16:40.972
You were so focused
on following Salma,

16:41.040 --> 16:43.208
you never realized you were
being followed yourself.

16:43.276 --> 16:44.676
Listen,
don't beat yourself up.

16:44.744 --> 16:48.013
I'm really good at this.
So you like to tell me.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.448
So how were you planning
on turning her?

16:50.516 --> 16:53.151
It's the hardest thing
we're tasked to do.

16:53.219 --> 16:54.853
Make your pitch at the
wrong time, in the wrong way,

16:54.920 --> 16:56.320
it can all blow up
in your face.

16:56.388 --> 16:58.456
How are you planning on
getting her to spy for Mossad?

16:58.523 --> 17:00.825
- I'm not.
- You're not?

17:00.892 --> 17:03.361
No. I'm gonna convince
an impressionable young woman

17:03.428 --> 17:06.931
to do a favor
for her new lover.

17:06.999 --> 17:09.400
It's a tactic tested
in the field many times.

17:11.703 --> 17:13.770
She will never know me
as anyone but George Yiokas,

17:13.838 --> 17:15.238
a businessman from Cyprus.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.473
Don't get too cocky yet,
<i>neshama.</i>

17:17.541 --> 17:19.742
I still have a few cards
up my sleeve.

17:19.810 --> 17:22.744
I'd keep them a little closer
to my chest this time.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.015
That was awkward.

17:26.082 --> 17:28.717
I just ran into someone
from work.

17:31.053 --> 17:33.287
He asked me
what I was doing here.

17:33.355 --> 17:34.589
- What did you tell him?
- You did you say?

17:34.656 --> 17:36.857
That you were an old friend
from university

17:36.925 --> 17:39.427
and that George here
was a private art collector

17:39.495 --> 17:40.929
trying to get lucky.

17:40.997 --> 17:42.297
That sounds about right.

17:44.267 --> 17:45.867
This place is feeling
a little tired.

17:45.935 --> 17:47.803
How about
we get out of here?

17:47.871 --> 17:49.872
All right.

18:03.854 --> 18:06.089
Finally, some privacy.

18:06.157 --> 18:09.125
It's getting late, George.
Can we drop you somewhere?

18:09.193 --> 18:10.527
What are you talking about?
The night is still young.

18:10.595 --> 18:13.163
I know this great little bar
in the Marais.

18:13.231 --> 18:14.865
Why don't we just drive
around a bit, okay?

18:19.505 --> 18:22.573
Nothing like this
ever happened to me before.

18:22.641 --> 18:25.343
I settle for the first guy
who show me any interest,

18:25.410 --> 18:27.645
and even he dumped me.

18:27.713 --> 18:30.181
And now, suddenly...

18:30.249 --> 18:32.984
There is this stunning man

18:33.052 --> 18:34.619
and this so glamorous
new friend

18:34.686 --> 18:37.689
fighting for my attention.

18:37.757 --> 18:41.393
And I can only come up
with one explanation.

18:41.461 --> 18:44.730
You want access
to the embassy.

18:44.797 --> 18:46.531
- Embassy?
- What are you talking about?

18:46.599 --> 18:49.701
I'm pretty sure Annie
works with the CIA.

18:49.769 --> 18:52.104
And if I have to guess,
George here--

18:52.172 --> 18:54.206
it's not your real name,
is it?

18:54.274 --> 18:56.808
It's probably MI-6.

18:56.876 --> 18:59.344
You seem too Jewish to be
an actual Mossad officer.

18:59.412 --> 19:01.747
Too Jewish?

19:01.815 --> 19:03.415
I think you've had
too much to drink.

19:03.483 --> 19:05.250
- I think you've lost it.
- Whatever.

19:05.318 --> 19:08.086
Mahmoud Kanaan
is coming to town tomorrow,

19:08.154 --> 19:09.922
and I know where.

19:09.989 --> 19:11.824
I've decided to auction off
what I know

19:11.891 --> 19:14.426
for the highest bidder.

19:16.897 --> 19:20.333
If I'm right, I will be waiting
for your offers.

19:20.401 --> 19:23.337
If I'm wrong, well...

19:23.404 --> 19:25.105
It was fun while it lasted.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.954
I totally didn't
see that coming.

19:39.022 --> 19:42.524
Did you?

19:42.592 --> 19:44.059
What is it about you
Americans

19:44.127 --> 19:47.062
that brings out the worst
in everyone you meet?

19:53.970 --> 19:55.737
Where do we stand?

19:55.804 --> 19:56.838
I've got Salma
on the other line.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.339
She says we have a deal
at 50.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.808
50,000 Euros.
What happened to 30?

20:00.876 --> 20:02.376
30 was half an hour ago,

20:02.443 --> 20:03.977
before Mossad
made their final bid.

20:04.045 --> 20:07.113
And you thought the pocketbook
was expensive.

20:07.181 --> 20:09.148
All right.
Let me check with Joan.

20:09.216 --> 20:11.217
Why does it feel like
we're bidding against ourselves?

20:11.284 --> 20:13.118
We're supposed to be allies.

20:13.186 --> 20:16.321
And there is no way Joan
authorizes 50.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.223
Not even to get
a bead on Kanaan.

20:19.826 --> 20:22.394
We are confirmed
up to 50,000.

20:23.897 --> 20:25.965
Make this happen, Annie.

20:29.169 --> 20:30.803
Salma?

20:30.870 --> 20:35.074
We got a deal.
<i>Bon soir,</i> Annie Walker.

21:17.351 --> 21:20.053
Typical CIA, huh?
Always taking shortcuts.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.622
She was supposed to meet me
at the cafe at 11:00.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.991
And me at the hotel
at 11:30.

21:25.059 --> 21:26.727
She took both our offers?

21:26.795 --> 21:29.597
I'm beginning to like
this girl more and more.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.437
Salma?

22:40.264 --> 22:41.865
I'll cover the street!

23:36.554 --> 23:38.388
Eyal!

23:57.575 --> 23:59.676
Who sent you?
What do you want?

23:59.744 --> 24:01.478
What do you want?

24:01.546 --> 24:03.948
<i>Que vois envoie?</i>
<i>Que vois envoie?</i>

24:20.438 --> 24:21.438
Could have
at least called it in.

24:21.610 --> 24:22.844
No. It will sort itself out.

24:23.236 --> 24:24.570
Less trail we leave,
the better.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.903
- So what now?
- Now we part ways

24:26.971 --> 24:28.738
and go to ground.

24:28.806 --> 24:30.173
This is as good a place
as any.

24:30.241 --> 24:31.541
Since I'm not one
for teary good-byes,

24:31.609 --> 24:33.477
let's leave it at au revoir.

24:38.350 --> 24:39.450
What about Kanaan?

24:39.518 --> 24:41.452
What about Kanaan?

24:41.520 --> 24:43.053
Well, Salma obviously
knew something

24:43.121 --> 24:44.621
for someone
to want her dead.

24:44.689 --> 24:46.456
And you're gonna
find out how?

24:46.524 --> 24:48.392
By going back to her place?
Good luck with that.

24:48.459 --> 24:49.793
When I went through
Salma's bag,

24:49.861 --> 24:51.428
there was something missing
from the day before.

24:51.496 --> 24:53.163
A post-it with
a phone number on it.

24:53.231 --> 24:55.265
It might have something
to do with Kanaan.

24:55.332 --> 24:56.899
If we put our heads together--
I don't do

24:56.967 --> 24:58.167
the putting together
of heads.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.469
I work alone.
But I think--

24:59.536 --> 25:02.538
No buts. I can't be
responsible for you.

25:02.606 --> 25:05.073
We really gotta stop
meeting like this.

25:11.914 --> 25:13.214
Okay, on three, guys.

25:13.282 --> 25:15.483
One, two, three.

25:15.550 --> 25:18.852
Happy Birthday!

25:18.920 --> 25:20.854
I hope we didn't
wake you up in Topeka

25:20.921 --> 25:22.789
or Des Moines

25:22.857 --> 25:25.558
or wherever you are today.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.098
We've got you on a new
return flight at 1600 hours.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.800
Auggie, is there a train
arriving at Gare de Lyon at...

25:34.868 --> 25:36.569
2:17?

25:36.637 --> 25:38.605
Yes. From Marseilles.
Why?

25:42.744 --> 25:45.313
I think I know
where Kanaan's going to be.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.882
And you've been working
at the World Bank for how long?

25:47.950 --> 25:49.183
11 years altogether,

25:49.251 --> 25:51.253
7 in development
in the Balkans

25:51.320 --> 25:53.288
and the last four...

25:53.355 --> 25:55.123
And in your capacity
at the World Bank,

25:55.190 --> 25:56.824
have you come in contact
with anyone--

25:56.892 --> 25:58.259
I'm...sorry.

25:58.326 --> 26:01.428
Would it be possible
to request a recess?

26:02.831 --> 26:05.399
A recess.

26:05.467 --> 26:08.202
It might be difficult
for you, juror 9, as a banker,

26:08.269 --> 26:11.839
to fully grasp the concept
of doing your civic duty.

26:11.906 --> 26:13.607
But I can assure you

26:13.675 --> 26:16.544
that unlimited texting does not
fall under its umbrella.

26:16.612 --> 26:19.581
Marshal, confiscate
juror 9's phone, please.

26:32.296 --> 26:33.663
Any news?

26:33.731 --> 26:35.064
Joan's not getting
back to me.

26:35.132 --> 26:36.566
I meant on Kanaan.

26:36.634 --> 26:38.167
Annie thinks he might be
arriving

26:38.235 --> 26:40.136
at the Gare de Lyon
in 15 minutes.

26:40.204 --> 26:41.672
Well, can she
get there in time?

26:41.739 --> 26:43.240
- Already in route.
- Waiting for you

26:43.307 --> 26:45.742
to make a decision.

26:45.810 --> 26:48.479
Salma's dead.
Mossad's already gone to ground,

26:48.547 --> 26:50.014
and Annie might be burned.

26:50.082 --> 26:53.017
Plus, we have no idea what
this guy even looks like.

26:53.085 --> 26:54.218
Which makes getting
a photo of him

26:54.286 --> 26:56.487
all the more valuable.

26:56.555 --> 26:58.256
Joan would bring her in.

26:58.324 --> 26:59.557
But you're not Joan.

27:04.730 --> 27:07.365
Hey, guys, book Annie
on a later return flight.

27:07.433 --> 27:11.036
She needs another hour.
Or two.

27:11.104 --> 27:13.071
Any idea how she's supposed
to take a picture of someone

27:13.139 --> 27:15.641
when no one knows
who she's looking for?

27:52.947 --> 27:55.114
Hey!

27:58.919 --> 28:00.487
Get it?

28:00.554 --> 28:02.956
Got it.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.561
That's a good picture.

28:07.629 --> 28:08.663
The frame...
The mise-en-scene...

28:08.730 --> 28:10.531
Ah, ah.

28:10.599 --> 28:12.166
Go on.

28:12.234 --> 28:14.169
Yeah? What do you want?
You want an award?

28:14.236 --> 28:17.606
No. I'm not
a prideful person.

28:17.673 --> 28:19.374
It's always nice,
a few accolades, though.

28:19.442 --> 28:21.109
Oh, you want accolades.

28:22.378 --> 28:24.112
All right.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.981
Here's some for you.

28:27.049 --> 28:28.383
You have a little game,
Annie Walker.

28:28.450 --> 28:31.019
I've seen a few in action.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.987
So many have trouble
improvising,

28:33.055 --> 28:35.256
but you...you have some
gears to shift into.

28:37.392 --> 28:38.559
And you have, uh,

28:38.627 --> 28:40.995
great interpersonal skills.

28:43.766 --> 28:46.601
See, I agree, but my family
doesn't think so.

28:46.668 --> 28:48.770
Family?

28:48.837 --> 28:51.405
My sister.
She thinks I'm lying

28:51.473 --> 28:53.808
and secretive and isolated.

28:53.876 --> 28:55.443
She also thinks
I'm in Topeka.

28:55.511 --> 28:58.179
- And you're close with her.
- Very.

28:58.247 --> 29:00.182
- But she doesn't know...
- Anything.

29:00.249 --> 29:02.718
That's how
the Agency likes it.

29:02.785 --> 29:03.752
Hmm.

29:03.820 --> 29:04.953
And you?

29:05.021 --> 29:08.090
I used to tell my wife
everything.

29:08.158 --> 29:09.959
You did?

29:10.026 --> 29:11.761
That's how Mossad likes it.

29:11.828 --> 29:13.429
They think it helps

29:13.497 --> 29:15.532
to have someone at home
who knows where you are,

29:15.599 --> 29:17.200
what you're doing.

29:17.268 --> 29:20.036
Helps tether you
to something concrete.

29:20.104 --> 29:21.938
Of course, then they get
to worry about you

29:22.006 --> 29:23.974
instead of living blissfully
in ignorance...

29:24.041 --> 29:27.277
So in a way, it's kind of
selfish to tell them.

29:30.381 --> 29:32.516
Or at least, that's what my wife
said when she was leaving me.

29:37.121 --> 29:39.823
Are you gonna tell me how you
found me at that train station?

29:41.659 --> 29:43.192
Or was it just a lucky guess?

29:47.298 --> 29:49.666
Just...

29:49.734 --> 29:51.234
Good trade craft.

29:51.302 --> 29:52.570
- Mm.
- I don't believe in luck.

29:52.637 --> 29:54.038
Really?

29:56.174 --> 29:57.908
So what time's your flight?

29:57.976 --> 30:00.244
You up for one more or, uh,

30:00.312 --> 30:02.547
you gotta call it quits?

30:11.024 --> 30:12.825
I think I have time
for one more.

30:15.629 --> 30:18.063
But only if you come clean
about the train station.

30:18.131 --> 30:19.031
Deal.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.767
Oh, hey, hold on
a second.

30:21.835 --> 30:24.404
You have a little, uh...

30:24.472 --> 30:26.339
Little schmutz
on your collar here.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.441
Merci.

30:28.509 --> 30:29.876
No problem.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.513
Oh, and have them make mine
a little dirtier next time.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.355
The man that was
sitting right here--

32:15.862 --> 32:18.063
Talk to me.

32:18.131 --> 32:20.465
- My location?
- 49 and 03 degrees north,

32:20.533 --> 32:23.301
3 and 56 east,
just outside Epernay.

32:23.369 --> 32:25.670
Now, hang tight.
The cavalry's on the way.

32:26.532 --> 32:28.733
Yeah. I need more details
than that.

32:28.801 --> 32:30.535
15, 20 minutes tops.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.674
Remember that course
they taught at the farm?

32:36.741 --> 32:38.108
How if you're captured...

32:38.176 --> 32:40.610
You've got an hour
or so to escape?

32:40.678 --> 32:43.247
And after that, the odds
of survival go to...

32:43.314 --> 32:44.648
next to nothing.

32:44.716 --> 32:46.750
Yeah.

32:46.818 --> 32:48.519
They've had Eyal
for over an hour now.

32:48.586 --> 32:52.056
Annie...You're what--
one against four, five?

32:52.123 --> 32:53.958
They have a video camera,
Auggie.

32:54.025 --> 32:55.660
And you're not
even armed.

32:55.727 --> 32:58.730
He doesn't have anyone
looking out for him but me.

33:04.538 --> 33:06.172
Okay.

33:06.239 --> 33:09.843
Let's work the problem.

33:09.911 --> 33:12.913
Tell me everything you see.

33:50.652 --> 33:51.853
You okay?

33:51.920 --> 33:53.788
Some explosion.
You cleared the room.

34:02.630 --> 34:05.632
I assume you have
a way out of here?

34:05.699 --> 34:07.099
Yeah. There's a truck
outside.

34:07.167 --> 34:09.634
The keys are in the ignition.
I checked.

34:26.117 --> 34:27.150
Shh!

34:34.826 --> 34:37.428
Any chance you've been
issued a gun yet?

34:37.495 --> 34:39.663
- Not yet.
- Yeah. This is a good plan.

34:43.735 --> 34:45.001
Let's go!

35:48.670 --> 35:50.037
Oh!

36:13.784 --> 36:15.284
What do you think?

36:15.352 --> 36:18.187
Ha ha ha.
They suit you.

36:18.818 --> 36:20.543
You could have
pulled out my shoes,

36:20.544 --> 36:21.920
out of that van,
before you blew it up.

36:21.921 --> 36:23.588
Well, maybe if you were more
interested in watching your back

36:23.656 --> 36:25.223
instead of stealing
my memory card...

36:25.290 --> 36:28.592
Yeah. Yeah, well, that was
painfully easy, wasn't it?

36:28.660 --> 36:30.094
The schmutz
on the collar routine.

36:30.161 --> 36:31.695
A red flag
should have gone up

36:31.763 --> 36:33.264
when you brought out
the yiddish.

36:33.331 --> 36:35.733
Where is my memory card,
by the way?

36:39.137 --> 36:41.739
You didn't.
The photo of Kanaan!

36:41.806 --> 36:44.008
Something for
the higher-ups to figure out.

36:49.881 --> 36:52.716
- That's me.
- Right.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.121
I forgot to get a receipt
from the cab

36:58.189 --> 36:59.455
when I went to the farmhouse.

36:59.523 --> 37:01.591
Well, we can
take care of that.

37:01.658 --> 37:02.759
Hold on a second.

37:05.195 --> 37:06.929
What are you doing?

37:06.997 --> 37:08.397
I don't know about Langley,

37:08.465 --> 37:10.132
but these work fine
for Mossad.

37:11.969 --> 37:14.237
So how much did it cost you?

37:14.305 --> 37:15.338
500 euro.

37:15.406 --> 37:17.842
500?

37:17.910 --> 37:20.545
Wow. You got
totally ripped off.

37:20.612 --> 37:22.480
You would have done
the same thing for me.

37:22.547 --> 37:24.415
At those prices...

37:24.483 --> 37:25.917
not a chance.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.560
You don't want
to miss your plane.

37:36.628 --> 37:38.129
Right.

37:57.416 --> 37:59.016
If you're still
sitting in the box,

37:59.084 --> 38:00.818
then you will be serving
on this jury.

38:00.886 --> 38:03.220
Now, I can see this trial
going one of two ways.

38:03.288 --> 38:05.857
It could carry on for
an extended period of time,

38:05.924 --> 38:07.725
or we could be out of here
in three weeks.

38:07.793 --> 38:08.960
So let's get comfortable.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.765
Yes, number 9.

38:14.467 --> 38:15.734
Your honor,

38:15.802 --> 38:18.670
I know this might
sound self-aggrandizing,

38:18.738 --> 38:21.407
but I cannot sit on
a three-week trial.

38:21.474 --> 38:22.941
My job needs me.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.476
You're right, number 9.

38:24.544 --> 38:25.878
I do hear

38:25.946 --> 38:28.046
the sound of
your own horn tooting.

38:28.114 --> 38:30.048
Sit down.

38:33.386 --> 38:35.353
Now, it is useful

38:35.421 --> 38:38.290
for you to know what the various
parts of the trial are.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.426
Can I borrow
your phone, please?

38:41.494 --> 38:43.061
...Stage of
the proceedings is...

38:43.128 --> 38:46.030
I will pay you $20.

38:46.097 --> 38:48.065
The trial starts
with opening statements

38:48.133 --> 38:49.799
by the lawyers,

38:49.867 --> 38:51.668
and then they will state
the nature

38:51.737 --> 38:54.472
of their factual
and legal claims.

39:04.117 --> 39:07.053
Opening statements
are not proof of evidence...

39:07.121 --> 39:11.057
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.593
Now, so that you
will be aware

39:13.661 --> 39:15.362
as you hear the evidence
of the legal claim--

39:16.664 --> 39:18.198
Excuse me.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.768
Thank you.

39:27.742 --> 39:29.742
Juror number 9.

39:29.810 --> 39:33.312
You have been excused
from serving on this jury.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.182
The court
would like to thank you

39:35.250 --> 39:37.251
for your service
to your community.

39:37.318 --> 39:39.553
Thank you, your honor.

39:39.621 --> 39:40.921
Can I have my phone, please?

39:43.659 --> 39:45.060
Excuse me.

39:45.128 --> 39:46.962
Excuse me.

39:51.602 --> 39:53.936
Mossad just
cabled this over.

39:54.004 --> 39:56.939
They tell me
it's a nice shot.

39:57.007 --> 39:58.474
Well, at least we know

39:58.541 --> 39:59.975
he's not a figment
of our imagination.

40:00.043 --> 40:01.610
Hmm.

40:01.678 --> 40:04.346
It's not easy, is it...

40:04.414 --> 40:07.449
Making decisions that affect
your friends' safety?

40:09.652 --> 40:10.952
No, it's not.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.622
Got news for you.

40:15.358 --> 40:16.826
Doesn't get any easier.

40:28.873 --> 40:36.647
♪ ♪

40:42.820 --> 40:44.054
I thought
I heard you come in.

40:44.122 --> 40:47.224
Oh. I didn't want
to wake you.

40:47.292 --> 40:49.159
Um...

40:49.227 --> 40:52.830
Thank you so much
for the message that you sent.

40:52.897 --> 40:54.831
It came
at the perfect time.

40:54.899 --> 40:57.468
You will never know how much
that meant to me.

40:57.535 --> 40:59.670
So how was Topeka?

41:01.272 --> 41:03.207
Actually...

41:03.274 --> 41:04.675
I didn't go to Topeka.

41:04.743 --> 41:06.577
I went to Paris.

41:09.147 --> 41:12.049
Paris?
As in Paris, Paris?

41:12.117 --> 41:13.917
<i>Oui.</i>

41:13.985 --> 41:16.186
How did that happen?

41:16.254 --> 41:18.188
It was a last-minute
thing at work.

41:18.256 --> 41:20.257
Oh-my-freaking-God!

41:20.325 --> 41:21.459
That's exactly what I said
when they told me--

41:21.526 --> 41:23.461
just like that.

41:23.529 --> 41:25.030
You little scamp.

41:26.766 --> 41:29.668
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

41:29.736 --> 41:31.670
I feel horrible about it.

41:31.738 --> 41:33.972
- It's okay.
- No.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.408
It's not okay.
It's not.

41:39.679 --> 41:41.213
Is that what
I think it is?

41:41.281 --> 41:43.015
Yeah.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.617
I wanted to spoil myself
for my birthday.

41:45.685 --> 41:47.920
Good for you.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.089
You deserve it.

41:50.157 --> 41:53.859
Now, this might not
be high fashion...

41:55.362 --> 41:56.361
But it is homemade.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.000
Happy Birthday.
