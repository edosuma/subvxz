00:27.161 --> 00:29.561
The town of
Ashton Cove was left

00:29.563 --> 00:32.097
in a nasty blood bath.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.499
No.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.267
The town of Ashton Cove was
left crumbled, smoldering,

00:35.269 --> 00:36.301
abandoned...

00:36.303 --> 00:37.136
No, in ruins.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.770
Oh no.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.507
The town of Ashton Cove was
left drenched in a state

00:41.509 --> 00:42.908
of sorrow.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.943
No, I can do better.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.845
Drenched in a state of ennui.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.915
It was left in a state of ennui.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.116
That's the one.

00:56.190 --> 00:56.989
Mom.

00:56.991 --> 00:57.823
Yes, honey.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.892
Sorry, sorry.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.933
Elijah knew
if he was ever going

01:07.935 --> 01:10.302
to escape, flee, no.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.772
He would have to conquer,
face, he would have to face

01:13.774 --> 01:15.340
the monster head on.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.609
Everyone else had already
surrendered, given up,

01:17.611 --> 01:19.211
white flag.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.646
Everyone else had already
risen their white flags,

01:20.648 --> 01:23.649
leaving for most of them
just wasn't an option.

01:23.651 --> 01:27.286
Elijah was the only one, he'd
been held captive long enough

01:27.288 --> 01:30.489
to know that even utter failure
would be worth the attempt.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.625
He knew that before he
became a slave to Ashton Cove

01:33.627 --> 01:34.893
he had to act.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.129
He didn't have a plan,
but he knew deep inside

01:37.131 --> 01:40.232
that once he got out
of here he'd be free.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.266
The end.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.141
Sorry, continue.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.411
That was
it, that was the end.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.380
Thanks
for that, Greg.

01:55.382 --> 01:56.448
Thoughts, everyone?

01:58.819 --> 02:01.220
Is it wrong to admit that
I was rooting for the monster

02:01.222 --> 02:02.888
the entire time.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.225
I mean, no offense but
this Greg protagonist

02:06.227 --> 02:08.426
is so unlikable...

02:08.429 --> 02:09.661
Elijah?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.096
No, it's Ian.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.198
The character's
name is Elijah.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.368
Whatever, he was just
frustratingly passive,

02:16.370 --> 02:19.404
I don't understand why anyone
would find him or anything

02:19.406 --> 02:21.907
he does interesting,
he's just too...

02:21.909 --> 02:22.941
Meek.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.276
Precisely.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.845
He's really the
shell of a human.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.748
I just don't believe in
building an entire story

02:29.750 --> 02:32.951
just so he could
say the words ennui.

02:32.953 --> 02:37.189
Okay, okay, there's no denying
that you have talent, Greg,

02:37.191 --> 02:40.158
for your age, it's just that

02:41.395 --> 02:43.662
the story was a
little superfluous,

02:45.432 --> 02:47.933
there's no passion
behind your words.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.234
When you're writing comedy...

02:49.236 --> 02:51.236
It's not really a comedy.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.572
You have to make
it unique to you.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.441
You must, you have to, you
got to make it about you.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.680
Life is like a reading
joke book backwards.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.250
You're constantly being
delivered the punchline

03:05.252 --> 03:09.554
and it's up to you to
figure out why it's funny.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.857
That's a
beautiful analogy, Martin.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.729
And tonally, your
story was jarring.

03:18.832 --> 03:22.334
Isn't life
jarring though, tonally?

03:22.336 --> 03:25.404
Okay, okay, let's have some
positives about Greg's story.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.826
Hey, Mom.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.594
Hi, honey.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.066
I am so sorry.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.270
It's just one school.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.871
Did you open this?

03:59.873 --> 04:00.739
Yes.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.377
You know what we should
do, we should go bowling.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.512
Mom.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.183
I can't believe you.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.297
I really don't
want you to get too down

04:25.299 --> 04:28.066
on yourself, being able to
take criticism is a huge part

04:28.068 --> 04:31.002
of being a successful writer.

04:31.004 --> 04:31.903
No, it's cool.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.205
I'm not that down about it.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.541
Heard from any schools yet?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.410
No, not yet.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.847
I'm sure you
will, you have a lot of drive

04:41.849 --> 04:44.049
to write and that's
a really great thing,

04:45.219 --> 04:47.018
but it just doesn't seem like
it's coming from anywhere

04:47.020 --> 04:48.553
that feels real right now.

04:50.324 --> 04:54.393
You need some experiences,
like outside of your laptop

04:54.395 --> 04:57.829
or you know, working
at Bent Taco.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.632
I actually enjoy
the solitude in the dish pit.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.937
Does the name Harvey
McCoy mean anything to you?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.941
I know that name, what was
that book, he had a book?

05:10.778 --> 05:11.977
The one book wonder.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.579
He's a fucken lunatic too.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.183
It just so happens he's
looking for an assistant

05:18.185 --> 05:20.452
for this new book tour
that he has, and uh,

05:22.890 --> 05:24.890
he's a bit of a dick
but we go way back.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.125
And it might be a good
opportunity for you.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.128
It's gonna give you more
inspiration than a fucking

05:30.130 --> 05:31.329
dish pit anyway.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.268
Plus I'll be on the uh,
I'll be on the last stop

05:36.270 --> 05:37.135
and I'll see ya.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.272
See ya at the finish line, yeah?

05:40.274 --> 05:41.206
That'd be great.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.207
And if you can make it.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.579
Look, you're doing a great job.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.747
What do I always say...

05:48.749 --> 05:50.982
- Writer's...
- Get better by writing.

05:50.984 --> 05:51.850
Yeah.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.427
Hi, uh, this is
Greg Gifford speaking.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.763
Hey, how's it going,
this is Greg Gifford.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.066
Greetings, I'm calling
you, Harvey McCoy.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.801
I too, as well write.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.236
I am a writer.

06:11.238 --> 06:15.874
Six foot two, 145 pounds,
18 years old, looking for

06:16.477 --> 06:18.410
some writerly knowledge.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.246
Hi, I'm Greg Gifford.

06:21.248 --> 06:25.684
I'm a writer and I am
looking to be your assistant.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.822
Hello?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.024
Hi

06:33.026 --> 06:33.825
Hello?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.126
I said hello.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.128
I'm calling about
the assistant job.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.131
Assistant
job, uh, yeah um...

06:40.133 --> 06:42.000
I'm actually a big fan,
so this opportunity seemed..

06:42.002 --> 06:44.436
I uh, Meso.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.171
Meso!

06:46.173 --> 06:50.308
Hello, this is Meso
Halloway, Harvey's agent.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.211
Hi, Meso, I'm Greg Gifford
calling for the assistant job.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.646
I got this number from Martin.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.947
Yeah, Martin.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.285
Yeah, Harvey's
incredibly busy with,

07:00.287 --> 07:03.288
he's busy with carry work,
so you as you can imagine,

07:03.290 --> 07:04.389
a very busy man.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.024
Okay.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.692
He does need
some assistance, he needs

07:07.694 --> 07:11.530
an assistant, so uh,
some help on the job.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.831
Of course.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.566
He's doing
a lot of stuff, yes.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.937
So the assistant job.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.207
The
what, assistant job?

07:22.209 --> 07:25.644
Yeah, I have a few serious
questions if that's okay?

07:25.646 --> 07:26.645
Yeah, definitely.

07:27.814 --> 07:31.249
Question
one, uh can you drive?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.851
You'll be driving.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.286
I have my full license, yup.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.555
Question two.

07:38.392 --> 07:39.824
Can you start tomorrow?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.928
Uh, yeah.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.663
Meso.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.497
Yes.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.833
I can only offer
you a 100 bucks.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.402
A day?

07:50.404 --> 07:51.269
Fine.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.204
Fine.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.273
Okay so, so when do I...

08:08.589 --> 08:10.255
I think I just
got a writing job.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.124
Oh, honey.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.773
I wanna
meet him first.

08:28.775 --> 08:29.741
Mom, no.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.309
Yes!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.211
No, he's not gonna take
me seriously if I have

08:33.212 --> 08:35.145
to have my mom meet him first.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.549
You don't even know him,
I'm not gonna let you go

08:38.552 --> 08:41.152
hang out with some random
old guy without at least

08:41.154 --> 08:42.721
speaking to him first.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.257
He's not some random old guy,
he's an accomplished writer,

08:46.259 --> 08:47.359
he's Harvey McCoy.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.229
Literally the only notable
person to come from this town.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.298
An accomplished writer
with a reputation.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.266
Everyone has a reputation,
that's why you're banned

08:55.268 --> 08:56.301
from garage sales.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.905
Well you remember what
happened to Madison Sorvil.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.241
Madison Sorvil got pregnant
because she slept with

09:03.243 --> 09:05.143
a reporter during the
Christmas festival.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.312
That's insanely different,
and not to mention,

09:07.314 --> 09:10.315
a wildly unrealistic
outcome for me.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.785
Listen, honey, I just don't
understand why you can't

09:13.787 --> 09:15.954
hang out with
people your own age.

09:15.956 --> 09:19.257
Martin gave me this opportunity
because he believes in me.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.992
Just because
someone is older

09:20.994 --> 09:22.827
does not make them wiser.

09:24.931 --> 09:25.764
Agreed.

09:33.340 --> 09:37.108
Okay, but I'm giving you my
credit card for emergencies.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.013
Just please let me
do this on my own.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.298
What's the name
of this book again?

10:01.968 --> 10:03.535
"The Grand Affliction".

10:14.347 --> 10:15.313
Bye, Mom.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.216
The credit cards
in your backpack.

10:19.986 --> 10:20.819
I love you.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.422
I love you too, Greg.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.057
Was that you just
knocking on my door?

11:33.059 --> 11:35.693
Yeah, I think
I'm your assistant.

11:43.737 --> 11:44.536
All right.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.322
So Greg is it?

12:06.860 --> 12:10.361
I've known a few Greg's in my
day, some of them were good,

12:10.363 --> 12:11.362
some of them were shit.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.767
So I take it you're a writer?

12:15.769 --> 12:17.368
Aspiring.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.436
Ah that's too bad.

12:21.541 --> 12:25.510
So what do you write about,
Craig, what are your demons?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.612
I mostly write monster
stories, actually.

12:27.614 --> 12:28.513
Uh-huh.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.848
So uh, you got a girlfriend?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.349
A mother.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.785
That's even
better, they're the best demons.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.288
You want a drink?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.524
No thank you.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.792
What are you allergic?

12:40.794 --> 12:43.161
No, it's just
really not my thing.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.696
All right.

12:44.698 --> 12:47.565
Well, we got three
rules around here.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.436
Number one, don't
touch anything.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.373
Don't touch anything.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.475
Leave all the doors closed
because I like it fucking

12:57.477 --> 12:59.244
freezing in here.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.313
And if I see you with a
cellphone in your hand,

13:02.315 --> 13:04.983
I'll break it, all right?

13:04.985 --> 13:09.220
If you gotta take a
shit, west, go west okay.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.688
All the west.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.725
Anywhere out west, not
the east, out the west.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.794
That's your toilet
essentially, okay.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.130
Finally,

13:21.334 --> 13:22.767
the Wi-Fi passcode

13:24.237 --> 13:29.307
is go fuck yourself, and
that's all in lower case.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.342
You got it?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.944
Got it.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.146
So, Craig, what do you
expect to get out of this?

13:36.883 --> 13:40.451
Well I'm saving up for
college and I've been working

13:40.453 --> 13:44.289
on a short story
for some deadlines,

13:44.291 --> 13:47.358
and I'm really just looking
to get some experience.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.294
Yeah.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.264
Well let's take you on a tour.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.799
That is your bed.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.573
I said don't touch anything.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.182
Elijah entered
the monsters layer,

14:44.184 --> 14:48.519
he was medicated, irrational,
and consumed by his ridiculous

14:48.521 --> 14:50.154
list of ground rules.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.358
The monster dragged Elijah
through the palace, straight

14:53.360 --> 14:57.195
to his cell, but for the
first time in a long while

14:57.197 --> 14:58.363
he felt alive.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.599
And like a complete
fucking cliche.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.280
So these next
three days are gonna

15:16.282 --> 15:17.782
be pretty action packed.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.787
There's gonna be
some press, you know?

15:22.789 --> 15:26.057
I just need you to know
where I need to be,

15:26.059 --> 15:27.525
when I need to be there.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.427
That's your job,
it's very important.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.364
Um, do we have a
game plan for tomorrow?

15:33.366 --> 15:37.301
Uh tomorrow, yeah, we're
doing, we're going to Meaford

15:37.303 --> 15:40.204
and then Collingwood,
and then Owen Sound.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.042
Uh, Meaford's gonna be
just a book signing event,

15:44.044 --> 15:45.510
I don't even think I'm
gonna do a reading unless

15:45.512 --> 15:46.744
they ask me.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.147
Unless like a fan
asks me or something,

15:49.149 --> 15:52.083
but it's really just a
charity event, frankly.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.288
Okay, um what time
are we gonna leave then?

15:58.358 --> 16:01.259
Oh I think we're
gonna leave around uh,

16:01.261 --> 16:02.827
well it's four hours to get,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.230
four hours to get there

16:06.232 --> 16:09.300
from uh...

16:12.338 --> 16:15.506
I think eight o'clock, no
later than eight o'clock.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.009
Okay, I'll uh,
set my alarm then.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.444
You know people think
this is a comeback,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.512
it's not a comeback
I never left.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.117
I've been busy,

16:28.188 --> 16:29.754
I've been busy, so.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.956
But what can you do, you know?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.291
Fans ask for it.

16:34.761 --> 16:39.363
I'm living this life, you know
for them, they asked for it.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.132
I didn't ask for it.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.267
Right.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.970
What was I sayin?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.372
The tour.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.907
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
the tour the last stop,

16:49.909 --> 16:51.109
that's Owen Sound.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.443
Owen Sound's the last stop.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.412
So that'll be the big
event, it's the main event.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.446
It's where we land, right.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.582
It's the final chapter.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.217
Why in Owen Sound?

16:59.219 --> 17:02.153
I mean, it's just kind of a
random place, don't you think?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.888
I like to go where the fans
are, I don't need a big city.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.261
So your job is gonna
be to pack this place.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.329
Okay, and that's the
most important thing,

17:12.332 --> 17:13.297
pack this place.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.237
You used to be a
club promoter, right?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.204
Um not me, no.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.013
All right, you can
just ask me directly,

17:29.015 --> 17:30.948
I mean I'm sure you
wanna know about it,

17:30.950 --> 17:33.417
all the parties and the,
well it's California

17:35.155 --> 17:37.955
and Judy Dench I met twice.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.958
Did you know that they were
gonna make a film out of

17:40.960 --> 17:42.260
"The Grand Affliction"?

17:43.496 --> 17:44.929
What happened with that?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.664
Ah, I said fuck it!

17:46.666 --> 17:49.400
You know movies are just
books for idiots, really.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.770
A proper story needs
to be told with words,

17:52.772 --> 17:54.438
right, expression.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.509
So uh, this book tour,
is it for a new book?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.044
What do you mean?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.312
I don't know how I
could reword that question

18:01.314 --> 18:02.947
any clearer.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.784
It's the 15th anniversary
of "The Grand Affliction".

18:06.786 --> 18:08.786
Fifth fucken teen.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.924
But you've written
other stuff since, right?

18:14.027 --> 18:16.127
Like short stories
or any novels?

18:28.908 --> 18:32.076
Obviously, that's
why I live alone.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.913
A writer needs isolation.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.887
Well and they need
a personal assistant

18:42.889 --> 18:46.424
but it's distraction, that's
the problem is distraction.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.594
There's no such thing
as writers block,

18:49.596 --> 18:53.598
there's no such thing as
writers block, it's distraction.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.465
Distraction.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.540
So tell me about this,
tell me about this poem

19:02.542 --> 19:03.407
that you wrote.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.411
It's actually a short story.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.347
I'd love if you read it,
you don't have to read it

19:09.349 --> 19:11.916
right now or anything,
but maybe tomorrow

19:11.918 --> 19:14.418
or on the book tour sometime.

19:14.420 --> 19:19.090
I'd love to get some
notes or advice.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.270
Okay,

19:35.708 --> 19:37.174
good night.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.643
The monster served
Elijah cold pizza.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.212
The master plan was
unveiled, Elijah's

19:41.214 --> 19:43.214
pleas went unanswered.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.149
The monster fell asleep.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.417
The monster passed out.

19:46.419 --> 19:50.087
The monster began
his slumber, no.

19:50.089 --> 19:53.557
The monster started his
slumber, it was the perfect time

19:53.559 --> 19:56.327
to attack, it was the
perfect time to pounce.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.663
It was the perfect
time to strike.

19:58.665 --> 20:02.633
However, Elijah had no
idea what to do next.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.210
If you think
this is when you met her,

20:46.212 --> 20:51.248
you're wrong, she met you
first when your family died

20:52.785 --> 20:54.885
and you were standing like a
slain stork refusing to fail,

20:54.887 --> 20:56.420
or cry, or die.

20:57.890 --> 21:02.259
And you said, "Hello, my whole
family died in a waterfall

21:03.129 --> 21:05.029
or on a mattress."

21:39.332 --> 21:40.998
Who the fuck are you?

21:41.000 --> 21:41.832
I'm Greg.

21:43.569 --> 21:44.902
Oh.

21:44.904 --> 21:45.736
Okay, let's go.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.499
Ta-da!

22:21.207 --> 22:25.943
Hang on Greg, are you
even old enough to drive?

22:25.945 --> 22:27.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

22:27.113 --> 22:28.913
How old are ya?

22:28.915 --> 22:29.980
I'm an adult.

22:29.982 --> 22:30.948
You're an adult.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.584
You don't look like an
adult, you got kinda look

22:33.586 --> 22:35.319
a little fresh face
you got you there.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.021
Eh, you look pretty.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.523
Pre-pubescent I'd say.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.129
Thanks.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.635
You got a real post
mortem aura about you.

22:51.637 --> 22:52.470
Yeah.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.431
Hey, Greg.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.833
How's the list look at the Roxy,

23:22.835 --> 23:24.335
how the ticket sales doing?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.971
The Roxy?

23:26.973 --> 23:29.340
Yeah, the Roxy, the theater
down in Owen Sound there.

23:29.342 --> 23:31.709
Huh, it's a main event!

23:31.711 --> 23:34.178
Jesus man!

23:34.180 --> 23:36.847
What were you into
last night, huh?

23:38.351 --> 23:39.850
I thought last night
was an introductory.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.151
Introductory, introductory.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.654
Well consider yourself
introduced, here.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.222
You know how to drive an RV?

23:46.158 --> 23:47.625
Do you?

23:47.627 --> 23:50.528
No, good luck.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.802
You know what, Gregory, in
some ways I consider myself

23:58.804 --> 24:01.305
your mentor, that
make sense to you?

24:01.307 --> 24:03.874
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some advice about writing.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.243
First, don't be a writer.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.312
This is the next thing
you need to know,

24:08.314 --> 24:11.148
never stop writing,
write everyday.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.683
Like me, I write everyday.

24:12.685 --> 24:16.520
I didn't write today, but, I
didn't write yesterday either.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.823
So why aren't we just
sleeping in the RV?

24:19.825 --> 24:21.325
Cause the RV is for naps.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.863
We're not living in the
fucking thing, just naps.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.998
I'm gonna write
tomorrow, I swear to God.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.334
You should make the same
promise, make that promise.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.368
I make a promise.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.403
Make the promise.

24:32.405 --> 24:33.170
I made the promise.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.238
What's the promise?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.539
I promise to write everyday.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.341
Everyday, did you write today?

24:38.277 --> 24:39.410
No.

24:39.412 --> 24:42.079
No, did
you write yesterday?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.013
- No.
- You're breaking

24:43.015 --> 24:44.315
the fucking promise already.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.885
Okay, so look it, we're
gonna do this right now,

24:47.887 --> 24:49.086
do a haiku about the trees.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.254
See the trees?

24:50.256 --> 24:51.121
Haiku.

24:51.924 --> 24:52.790
Go.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.225
Go.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.361
The green of your bush.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.531
What?

25:00.533 --> 25:04.268
Needles touching on me.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.705
What?

25:08.707 --> 25:10.707
Did you say the needles
touching on me?

25:10.710 --> 25:13.410
Did you just say the
needles touching on me,

25:13.412 --> 25:15.346
that's your fucking haiku?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.291
We're forgetting something.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.259
Like at the house?

25:29.261 --> 25:30.928
No, no, no.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.664
Book signing, book
signing, book signing.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.767
I guarantee we've
got all the books.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.469
No not the books,
not the books.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.572
The standee, the standee.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.608
All right, well we gotta find
a print shop along the way.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.477
What print shop?

25:46.479 --> 25:47.344
Where are we?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.648
Beaverton.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.250
Beaverton, that's
what I call serendipity.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.021
You know what serendipity is?

25:57.023 --> 25:57.921
Yes.

25:57.923 --> 25:59.189
Okay, good.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.724
All right, turn right up here.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.027
How far are we?

26:03.029 --> 26:04.161
I'll tell you when.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.943
Is it?

26:19.945 --> 26:22.246
I will tell you
when to turn, okay?

26:25.718 --> 26:27.017
Now!

26:35.561 --> 26:37.494
That's perfect.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.762
Let's get it in the RV.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.170
Be careful, be careful,
be careful, be careful.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.272
Don't bend it, don't bend it.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.311
Is it in?

26:54.313 --> 26:55.145
Yeah?

26:56.215 --> 26:57.381
Oh yeah baby.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.251
Oh no,

27:01.253 --> 27:03.087
Jesus Christ!

27:03.089 --> 27:05.989
Look at that, oh my fucking God!

27:05.991 --> 27:07.224
It's okay we'll figure
it out when we get there.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.760
We're not going
there, that's it man.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.328
I'm done, I'm not going.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.163
Well why?

27:13.165 --> 27:14.732
Why?

27:14.734 --> 27:18.202
Because that my friend is a
bad omen if I've ever seen one.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.038
Look at it, bad omen.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.444
Mind you...

27:29.849 --> 27:32.416
I mean most people know
what I look like, right?

27:33.452 --> 27:36.754
That's just kinda
redundant if I'm there.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.224
Ah, I think it's gonna be okay.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.125
It's gonna be all right.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:42.194 --> 27:43.694
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay?

27:44.764 --> 27:45.629
All right.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.094
Hi, I'm gonna get the
eggs benedict, and does

28:17.096 --> 28:18.495
that come with home fries?

28:18.497 --> 28:19.429
Yup.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.631
Okay I'll get them, thank you.

28:20.633 --> 28:21.999
And for you?

28:23.235 --> 28:24.902
Sir?

28:24.904 --> 28:27.971
Uh, yeah I'll have a bourbon
please, shot of bourbon neat.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.142
I thought we stopped
because you were famished?

28:32.144 --> 28:34.578
I'll have a piece
of toast, something.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.347
It's before 11 a.m., we
can't serve alcohol yet.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.150
Are you serious?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.920
Jesus Christ!

28:44.089 --> 28:46.290
All right, I'll
have water, water.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.026
A glass of water,
thank you, neat.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.260
Sure.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.370
What are you doing,
you're freaking me out?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.605
I can't find my
mom's credit card.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.207
I can't find
my mom's credit card.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.276
Jesus Christ man,
listen to yourself.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.679
I must have left
it at your place.

29:08.681 --> 29:09.713
It's all right I got this.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.348
Oh, I have to go pee.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.156
Kids eat for free here?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.290
No.

29:43.515 --> 29:46.216
The monster was
beginning to show his true colors.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.718
Elijah had it all wrong.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.222
He didn't have to look for
the perfect moment to strike,

29:53.058 --> 29:55.292
he was bound to self destruct.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.731
That gigantic
fucken chocolate ass.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.667
He saw it when
the monster saw itself,

30:03.669 --> 30:04.935
its reflection.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.740
I fucken told ya!

30:09.742 --> 30:11.808
What he saw
wasn't the reality.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.947
His power was merely a
mask, a mask that deflected.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.082
Let's go.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.198
Where are you going?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.033
Book signing.

30:37.202 --> 30:38.201
Did you pay?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.371
What kind of a
question is that?

30:41.373 --> 30:44.541
Of course I paid, I'm a New
York Times best selling author!

30:45.411 --> 30:46.209
Okay, I'm sorry.

30:46.211 --> 30:47.945
Did I pay!

30:47.947 --> 30:49.112
Jesus Christ.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.383
Did you pee when you
went to the bathroom?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.185
What the

31:29.188 --> 31:30.787
fuck is this?

31:30.789 --> 31:31.855
This can't be right.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.993
This can't be fucken right.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.363
Home of the future,
the future new library.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.236
I gotta make a phone call.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.009
Jesus Christ.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.696
Oh hello, it's
Harvey McCoy calling.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.465
Yes, the author of
"The Grand Affliction".

32:15.467 --> 32:18.835
You set up a reading for
me here at the Meaford

32:18.837 --> 32:22.305
Public Library and I'm
very excited about that,

32:22.307 --> 32:26.910
except it's not even
fucken built yet!

32:26.912 --> 32:29.112
Half of the thing is a Foodland.

32:30.582 --> 32:34.284
It says it's not gonna
be open for a year, man.

32:35.487 --> 32:40.190
This is the 15th anniversary
tour of "The Grand Affliction",

32:40.192 --> 32:41.858
not the 16th!

32:41.860 --> 32:43.627
Not the fucken 16th!

32:45.364 --> 32:46.997
You shoulda let me know.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.666
No you didn't, no you didn't.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.967
If you did I'd know.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.674
What just happened?

32:57.676 --> 32:59.843
What just happened,
what just happened is

33:01.346 --> 33:03.413
a stupid fuck up just happened.

33:06.085 --> 33:09.019
You can not trust anybody ever.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.454
Should we call Meso?

33:11.256 --> 33:12.889
Who?

33:12.891 --> 33:14.124
Your agent.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.326
My agents, my
agents on vacation.

33:17.863 --> 33:22.265
Besides, this is all on
you, man, you fucked up.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.969
You were supposed
to get results, man.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.437
Results, how?

33:27.439 --> 33:31.274
If you managed to get results,
how you did so is futile.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.262
I really
don't understand what

33:52.264 --> 33:53.897
you want me to write.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.232
A scathing letter.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.135
To the library?

33:58.137 --> 34:00.003
No, to
fucken Santa Claus!

34:02.407 --> 34:04.174
These people are
lucky to have me.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.343
All right, start writing.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.210
Okay,

34:08.013 --> 34:09.478
your institution

34:11.283 --> 34:12.149
holds

34:14.152 --> 34:19.222
histories and knowledge, and
all of these wonderful things.

34:20.492 --> 34:24.761
So I find it appalling, no
frankly I find it obscene

34:24.763 --> 34:25.929
that you are run by

34:30.302 --> 34:32.402
inane cunts.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.237
Geez!

34:35.440 --> 34:36.505
Just keep writing.

34:38.643 --> 34:43.713
Hatred is a very strong word,
but it is not strong enough

34:46.885 --> 34:50.085
for the loathing I feel for you.

34:51.156 --> 34:55.257
For you hairy horny
hobbit whores.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.795
You know, you can get
a lot more attraction

34:58.797 --> 35:00.597
writing a Yelp
review or something.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.334
That's not a word,
Greg, you know that.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.802
No, the website?

35:05.804 --> 35:08.338
Where you can write reviews
and it actually has an effect

35:08.340 --> 35:09.839
on a place.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.175
You've heard of the
internet, right?

35:12.177 --> 35:14.544
You little shit, of course
I've heard of the internet.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.646
It could really be a
useful tool for promotion

35:16.648 --> 35:19.616
for your events, it can
really help you out.

35:22.054 --> 35:23.386
It's just a suggestion.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.341
All right, you write
that up at the motel, okay?

35:44.343 --> 35:45.275
The Yelp review?

35:46.278 --> 35:47.510
Yes, the Yelp review!

35:48.914 --> 35:50.413
You can't just make up words.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.553
So do you think you'll
have time tonight to read

35:56.555 --> 35:58.221
my short story?

35:58.223 --> 35:59.022
So do you think
you'll have time to tonight

35:59.024 --> 36:00.757
to read my short story?

36:00.759 --> 36:05.362
Do you think time to read the
fucken.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.596
What?

36:06.598 --> 36:08.765
I just don't feel
like reading right now.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.837
And where the hell are we?

36:26.285 --> 36:31.254
Oh, oh we got time for a pit
stop, just up here on the left.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.291
I think we should
just get to the motel.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.126
I got some property
right up here.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.397
Why aren't we staying
there instead of the motel?

36:41.800 --> 36:46.870
Because I am not a
fucken crystal ball, man.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.338
I don't know.

36:49.474 --> 36:53.043
It's more of a, more of
a storage unit really.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.879
Why are we going there?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.918
Greg, if you happen to

37:04.323 --> 37:06.990
get a best selling novel
one day, what would you buy

37:06.992 --> 37:09.326
with that first big pay
check, what would it be?

37:10.662 --> 37:11.795
A plane ticket.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.662
Wrong.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.800
You would buy an expensive
suit, the best suit,

37:16.802 --> 37:19.669
your favorite suit, the
suit you always wanted.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.304
You know why?

37:21.306 --> 37:23.673
Cause then you
look the part, huh?

37:25.210 --> 37:26.710
Write it down.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.577
Go ahead.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.412
Write it down.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.319
So we're detouring for a suit?

37:36.321 --> 37:41.391
Oh no, my friend, not
just any suit a lucky suit.

37:42.327 --> 37:43.526
And it's right up
here on the left.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.974
And you missed it.

38:25.237 --> 38:27.504
All right, so it's on the top
floor, upstairs bedroom closet

38:27.506 --> 38:31.741
I think, uh, but I wouldn't
put it past me in the basement.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.277
So go.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.380
So you're not
coming in with me?

38:37.382 --> 38:38.248
Well I,

38:39.284 --> 38:40.083
no.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.284
This is your house?

38:41.286 --> 38:43.052
Yeah, it's my house,
it's my house, it's just

38:43.054 --> 38:45.288
it's very dusty in there
and I don't wanna expose

38:45.290 --> 38:49.025
myself to a dangerous dust.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.362
But you're smoking.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.398
Jesus Christ, for a fucken
assistant you complain a lot

38:55.400 --> 38:56.933
about assisting.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.468
Let's go, assist, assist.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.538
Just thought I'd get some
writerly advice or some

39:01.540 --> 39:05.875
knowledge or something,
but I guess I'm not.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.445
Don't bang a groupie.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.113
What?

39:10.949 --> 39:12.282
Let's go, let's go!

40:26.558 --> 40:28.057
What the fuck.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.051
No.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.694
Harvey.

41:13.004 --> 41:13.836
I got it!

41:19.444 --> 41:20.643
Fuck, fuck.

41:23.748 --> 41:24.747
Who the fuck are you?

41:24.749 --> 41:26.249
I'm Greg.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.084
Shelby.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.787
Well look who it fucking is.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.455
Harvey goddamn McCoy.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.390
I knew you'd have to
be lurking around here.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.858
Hi, baby, how you doin?

41:35.860 --> 41:37.794
It's been a long
time, you look great.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.062
Are you fucking serious?

41:39.064 --> 41:40.563
Yeah, you look...

41:40.565 --> 41:42.432
Did you pay a fucking child
to come steal your suit back?

41:42.434 --> 41:45.234
No, of course I
didn't, come on.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.703
It's not what this looks like.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.571
It doesn't look
like that at all.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.239
Baby, you gotta
lower the gun okay.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.308
The gun, lower the gun
please, so we can talk.

41:52.310 --> 41:53.776
We can have a
little conversation.

41:53.778 --> 41:54.877
Can I leave?

41:54.879 --> 41:56.279
- No!
- No!

41:56.281 --> 41:58.114
Okay, I don't know who you
are, but you should stay

41:58.116 --> 41:59.716
away from this piece of shit!

41:59.718 --> 42:01.551
He's a bad man.

42:01.553 --> 42:05.321
Cheryl, please, you
gotta let me explain.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.857
How could you leave
without saying anything?

42:09.427 --> 42:10.827
I left a note.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.595
You ripped out the words
at the end from your book

42:12.597 --> 42:14.297
and taped it to a picture of us.

42:14.299 --> 42:15.765
What?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.100
Did I?

42:17.102 --> 42:18.468
That sounds pretty
unlikely, really.

42:18.470 --> 42:20.670
But still, for whatever
reason, I waited months

42:20.672 --> 42:22.305
for you to come back.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.807
I fucking used up all my
vacation days just in case

42:24.809 --> 42:26.576
I would miss you.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.444
Darling, that sounds
very ill advised.

42:28.446 --> 42:31.481
Well I'm not taking your
shit anymore, no more.

42:31.483 --> 42:33.182
Fuck I did everything for you.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.185
I bought 40 copies of
your book and I basically

42:36.187 --> 42:38.454
promoted the thing,
for what, for what?

42:38.456 --> 42:40.056
For nothing, to be abandoned!

42:41.326 --> 42:45.595
Darling, I think what we
gotta do right now please,

42:45.597 --> 42:48.164
is we gotta look at
the positives, okay?

42:48.166 --> 42:50.500
The positives between me
and you, in our relationship

42:50.502 --> 42:52.468
we had positive moments.

42:52.470 --> 42:53.269
We did.

42:56.174 --> 42:57.006
Like,

42:58.843 --> 43:01.310
the time I stopped you
from getting the tattoo.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.379
You're not the
fucking stick and poke.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.416
I thought that was
something very different.

43:08.153 --> 43:12.455
Uh please, darling, you
know I would not come here

43:12.457 --> 43:14.457
if I didn't have a good reason.

43:16.061 --> 43:17.894
More like an opportunity?

43:19.297 --> 43:22.265
Well yeah, yeah,
like an opportunity.

43:25.203 --> 43:29.772
Like an opportunity to
introduce you to my child, okay.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.241
Oh my God.

43:32.243 --> 43:33.109
Yeah.

43:34.679 --> 43:35.478
Are you serious?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.380
I'm very serious.

43:37.382 --> 43:38.915
But I thought
you had a daughter.

43:38.917 --> 43:39.782
So did I.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.885
- Harvey?
- Yes.

43:42.887 --> 43:43.753
This is huge.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.490
It's gargantuan, huh?

43:47.492 --> 43:49.258
Oh hi, sweetie.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.360
Run!

44:14.185 --> 44:15.685
Fuck you, Harvey!

44:18.289 --> 44:20.022
Holy fuck!

44:33.972 --> 44:36.739
Never tell a girl you
wrote a book about her,

44:36.741 --> 44:37.940
even if you did.

44:37.942 --> 44:39.342
That's my advice to you, pal.

44:41.045 --> 44:42.345
Oh man.

44:45.216 --> 44:48.050
Jesus man, what the hell.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.318
What the hell?

44:49.320 --> 44:50.553
- Yeah.
- I'm the one

44:50.555 --> 44:52.288
who should be asking
that question.

44:52.290 --> 44:55.992
Okay look, I would never
have sent you into that house

44:55.994 --> 44:57.960
if I had known that
woman had a gun.

44:57.962 --> 45:01.230
I promise I never
would have, ever.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.599
We almost fucking
died back there, died,

45:03.601 --> 45:05.234
and for what, a suit?

45:05.236 --> 45:08.204
Yeah, a very
expensive suit, man.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.473
I quit.

45:10.475 --> 45:11.741
You can't quit,
there's no where to go,

45:11.743 --> 45:13.276
you're in the middle of nowhere.

45:13.278 --> 45:16.712
This is fucking insane I'm
not doing this for $100 a day.

45:18.917 --> 45:22.285
Okay, okay, I'll make it $150.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.153
That's not why
I took this job.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.689
Okay.

45:28.293 --> 45:29.792
What do you want?

45:29.794 --> 45:31.694
I just want you to read my
short story and give me notes

45:31.696 --> 45:33.596
on it to help me
become a better writer.

45:33.598 --> 45:36.032
Writers get better by
writing, there you go.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.402
Then I guess you peaked.

45:46.311 --> 45:47.376
All right.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.680
All right, I'll read your story.

45:53.985 --> 45:55.117
I'll read your story.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.888
You don't believe me?

45:58.890 --> 46:00.022
Here, pass it over.

46:01.693 --> 46:04.193
I'll read it tonight at
the motel, I promise.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.399
Thank you very much.

48:42.286 --> 48:43.519
Testing, test.

49:19.357 --> 49:21.057
How much time we got, Greg?

49:21.059 --> 49:22.491
You're already
15 minutes late.

49:22.493 --> 49:23.325
Perfect.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.369
I want you to go see how
many people are sitting

49:33.371 --> 49:34.770
in those chairs.

49:43.281 --> 49:46.449
Please welcome
Mr. Harvard Wolworth McCoy.

50:00.231 --> 50:05.367
Well hello
everyone.

50:05.369 --> 50:08.270
I'd like to thank you
all for coming out.

50:08.272 --> 50:11.807
It's very hard to believe
that "The Grand Affliction"

50:11.809 --> 50:13.476
is 15 years old.

50:15.580 --> 50:19.315
I've been asked to do a Q
and A, but I'm gonna forgo

50:19.317 --> 50:22.785
that for the time being,
because my friend here asked

50:22.787 --> 50:24.954
for me to read a
special passage.

50:24.956 --> 50:28.924
I don't mind saying it's
a difficult passage,

50:28.926 --> 50:30.392
and I'll be frank,

50:32.463 --> 50:34.463
it's a painful passage.

50:34.465 --> 50:35.397
So bear with me.

50:54.852 --> 50:55.651
Name?

50:55.653 --> 50:56.785
Lauren.

50:56.787 --> 50:58.087
Lorraine.

50:58.089 --> 50:59.155
Lauren.

50:59.157 --> 51:01.257
There you go, thank you.

51:01.259 --> 51:02.658
I love your book.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.093
Oh thank you very much.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.361
I wrote a paper on it.

51:05.363 --> 51:06.962
No kidding!

51:06.964 --> 51:08.664
I'm very flattered,
what's your name?

51:08.666 --> 51:09.532
Dan.

51:11.369 --> 51:12.434
There you go, Dan.

51:12.436 --> 51:13.202
Thank you.

51:13.204 --> 51:15.204
Have a good day.

51:15.206 --> 51:16.372
Harvey McCoy.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.208
Do I know you?

51:19.210 --> 51:22.344
Probably, I'm a reporter
for the local paper.

51:22.346 --> 51:25.281
I was hoping you'd be open
to answering a few questions.

51:25.283 --> 51:28.450
Look, press questions
go through my agent.

51:28.452 --> 51:30.286
Hey, what just
happened in there?

51:30.288 --> 51:32.688
Don't worry, this
isn't about the book.

51:33.991 --> 51:36.358
Oh, I'm answering questions
only about the book.

51:38.462 --> 51:39.295
Fine.

51:40.631 --> 51:43.566
What about the
inspiration behind the book?

52:05.756 --> 52:06.755
Let's go.

53:06.150 --> 53:07.616
I have a daughter.

53:09.253 --> 53:12.321
I saw a picture
on your mantle.

53:12.323 --> 53:13.155
Yeah, hm.

53:20.298 --> 53:21.163
Where is she?

53:28.306 --> 53:29.905
I was a good father.

53:29.907 --> 53:32.641
I was a good father, for a
few years I was a good father.

53:34.178 --> 53:36.979
It was something I wanted to
be, I made the commitment.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.650
I loved her, she loved
me, I was her whole world,

53:41.652 --> 53:42.918
she was my whole world.

53:44.422 --> 53:46.021
And when they're that age
and they look up at you,

53:46.023 --> 53:50.326
they don't want anything from
you but for you to love them

53:50.328 --> 53:52.428
and I did, I loved
her and she loved me.

53:55.466 --> 53:57.266
Which is fine, but I wasn't
totally getting along

53:57.268 --> 53:58.534
with her mother.

53:59.603 --> 54:01.403
We were living together,
we were married.

54:03.274 --> 54:08.344
Anyway, so I got this, my first
big, my first big book deal.

54:10.214 --> 54:12.848
And it was a big deal
to me, and I thought,

54:12.850 --> 54:16.352
"Man, I better take this
seriously and I've gotta put

54:16.354 --> 54:17.853
some time into it."

54:17.855 --> 54:21.190
And I put all this time into
and that took time away from,

54:22.626 --> 54:26.261
from her and my marriage.

54:27.498 --> 54:29.665
You know, it's not an
uncommon story, right,

54:29.667 --> 54:33.235
when you just head off
in different directions.

54:33.237 --> 54:36.372
And, you know, I knew
it was coming to an end,

54:36.374 --> 54:37.206
so did she.

54:38.576 --> 54:42.978
And we separated, and for
awhile it wasn't all that bad,

54:42.980 --> 54:43.812
it was...

54:46.150 --> 54:50.252
It was manageable, you
know, like it wasn't ideal

54:50.254 --> 54:53.155
it wasn't the dream,
it was just manageable.

54:55.226 --> 54:57.493
But to cope with it,

54:58.863 --> 55:00.496
man I started drinking.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.099
I started drinking real heavy.

55:05.369 --> 55:08.837
And that just uh, I
just turned everything

55:08.839 --> 55:10.072
into a giant mess.

55:13.177 --> 55:16.311
So, I couldn't visit anymore,

55:18.249 --> 55:20.416
she didn't want me to come
around, because of things

55:20.418 --> 55:22.217
that happened that I'm
not even gonna go into

55:22.219 --> 55:24.620
that frankly, I don't
even remember, not really.

55:26.223 --> 55:27.523
I don't remember everything.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.760
But I always remember
her birthday.

55:34.932 --> 55:37.299
I needed that connection,
I needed to feel

55:39.236 --> 55:40.869
I had a connection with her.

55:44.241 --> 55:46.408
And I looked for it on her
birthday's, and when her

55:46.410 --> 55:48.143
fifth birthday came around

55:52.116 --> 55:54.216
her mother didn't
want me to see her.

55:54.218 --> 55:56.552
That was the thing, she
was not gonna let me see

55:58.389 --> 56:00.489
my own daughter on her fifth,

56:01.959 --> 56:04.893
fifth birthday, which
honestly I understood.

56:04.895 --> 56:08.897
At the time when she said
that, as pissed as I was,

56:11.402 --> 56:12.734
I understood why.

56:18.175 --> 56:20.342
So on the day of her
birthday I drank.

56:20.344 --> 56:21.810
I got up early

56:25.082 --> 56:26.849
and I drank a hell of a
lot and I got hammered,

56:26.851 --> 56:29.518
I got blackout drunk.

56:33.657 --> 56:37.326
And the next thing
I know

56:40.097 --> 56:41.530
next thing I know,

56:44.702 --> 56:47.336
I was wrapped around the
tree out front of the house.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.173
Totaled the car.

56:52.810 --> 56:54.843
And there were kids, it
was a birthday party,

56:54.845 --> 56:56.945
so there's kids coming
in and out of the,

56:59.884 --> 57:02.417
my daughter was coming
in and out of the house.

57:07.324 --> 57:09.191
And that was it,
I'd finished it.

57:12.997 --> 57:15.731
I was never to be
forgiven for that.

57:17.501 --> 57:18.300
And again,

57:20.337 --> 57:21.370
I knew why.

57:27.378 --> 57:30.712
As horrible as it looked, it
was as horrible as I felt.

57:32.917 --> 57:36.451
And I knew that I had
lost, I'd lost them.

57:38.422 --> 57:40.822
It's not something
you can accept really,

57:40.824 --> 57:45.327
so what I did was, I thought
to myself, "There's gotta

57:45.329 --> 57:47.930
be a way that I can make this,

57:47.932 --> 57:50.399
some way that I can make this,

57:51.869 --> 57:54.736
some way I could make it okay."

57:54.738 --> 57:58.507
You know, manageable
again, normal again.

58:00.744 --> 58:03.445
So I did the smart
thing, I quit drinking.

58:03.447 --> 58:04.479
I stopped drinkin.

58:05.516 --> 58:08.917
Which was a big deal
and wasn't easy.

58:11.221 --> 58:16.291
And uh, the next thing I
thought I had to do was,

58:17.061 --> 58:19.361
well I'm gonna write that book.

58:22.967 --> 58:23.832
And I did.

58:26.637 --> 58:28.670
It wasn't the book
the publisher wanted,

58:29.473 --> 58:30.839
but a different book.

58:32.643 --> 58:34.776
But luckily he liked
it, he loved it.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.246
And so did other people,
because it ended up on

58:38.248 --> 58:42.317
the New York Times best
selling list, as I like to say.

58:45.656 --> 58:48.457
But that book,
that 300 page book,

58:54.431 --> 58:56.865
was meant for one person only,

58:58.268 --> 58:59.134
meant for Hannah.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.373
So that she could

59:06.577 --> 59:07.976
see how I felt,

59:10.347 --> 59:11.847
hear my apology,

59:14.418 --> 59:17.352
and understand that
this is important to me.

59:17.354 --> 59:21.423
That she understood that I knew

59:23.661 --> 59:27.396
I had, I had ruined
her first family,

59:30.868 --> 59:35.937
and that maybe this was a
place to start from, this book.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.474
Because I was never gonna
reach her, I was never

59:39.476 --> 59:41.009
gonna get a card to her,
I was never gonna get

59:41.011 --> 59:42.344
a phone call to her.

59:42.346 --> 59:44.546
I didn't even know for
a long period of time,

59:46.150 --> 59:48.183
where they were living.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.187
But if I put a book out,

59:54.458 --> 59:57.492
it's out there forever,
she'll find it one day

59:57.494 --> 59:59.227
and she'll read it.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:00.195
And it's dedicated

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:04.766
to Hannah McCoy.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.408
But she didn't read it,
or at least if she did

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:19.414
I guess it didn't
mean much to her,

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:25.987
because I never heard from
her or her mother again,

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.391
for 15 years,

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:31.727
16 years.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:41.837
So I decided that the next
best thing I could do,

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:48.410
because I knew, the only
thing I knew about her

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:49.745
was that she lives in

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:52.681
Owen Sound.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.185
- The last stop.
- The last stop.

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.789
That's what this
whole thing is about.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:04.426
This what everything is about,
I sank in my very last penny,

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.896
I made sure my name
was in the newspapers,

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.297
I did the interviews,

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:16.538
because I thought if
she knew I was here

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:24.479
then maybe, you know
maybe, maybe she comes.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.285
I don't think she's gonna come.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:36.391
I mean, I don't think
this is the right move.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.496
I just can't accept this.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:52.707
This is the stupidest
fucking idea I ever had.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.011
I don't think it's stupid.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.381
No?

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.488
All right, I'm gonna go
outside and get some fresh air.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:16.698
Hm, don't stay up all night
on that thing, all right?

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.102
I think tomorrow's
gonna be a good one.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:24.539
I hope you're right, kid.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:52.193
Hey, Mom.

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:52.928
Where
the hell are you?

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:53.929
Are you running away?

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:54.729
What?

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:56.398
No I'm not running away.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.632
There's over 20
charges on my credit card,

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:59.367
- what are doing?
- How many charges?

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.771
Yes, you racked
up over $2,000 on my card!

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.073
I thought I left the
credit card at Harvey's.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:06.441
I am calling
the police right now,

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.310
and I'm coming to get you.

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:11.046
No, Mom, don't call anyone,
I know how to fix this.

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:13.214
I warned you about
this fucking guy, Greg.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:15.083
Mom, it's okay, I
love you good bye.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:16.885
No, Greg, do
not hang up the phone.

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:32.467
Who the fuck are you?

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:33.468
Fucking, Greg!

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.004
Look, Greg, I think
you got the wrong room.

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:38.006
No, I've got the right one.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.341
Oh fuck!

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:40.275
Where the fuck is my
mom's credit card, Harvey?

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:41.309
Hey!

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.610
Hey, really?

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:45.013
Greg, I don't have
your mom's credit card.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.781
I don't know what you're
talking about, get off me.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.118
Ow, ow.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120
What the fuck is this?

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.055
I'll tell you
what this is, Grego,

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:58.994
that's my credit card my name
is Wendy Giggles.

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.996
Shut the fuck up, Harvey.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.330
I don't think that's her
name, I don't think that's

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:03.365
her real name.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.091
Greg.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:04.826
I'd like to talk.

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:07.429
What could you possibly
have to say to me right now?

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:11.332
Well, thank
you for finding me.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.803
That's it, not sorry?

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.839
What the fuck are you
thinking in there?

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:19.507
Your biggest event is
tomorrow and you're drinking

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:20.742
yourself stupid?

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:26.915
Everything you've
put towards this

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:31.519
is shot now, do you not
give a fuck about anything?

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:36.124
I thought this was
for your daughter.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.159
Or was that even true?

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:42.097
I would never lie
about her, Greg.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.365
I don't know to what
extent you'd lie anymore

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:45.300
to get what you want.

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:54.242
What everyone says
about you is true,

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:55.810
you're a washed up asshole.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.120
What are you doing?

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.925
I think I'm having
a heart attack, Greg.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:12.894
What, a heart attack?

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.976
Hello,
911 what's your emergency?

01:07:27.978 --> 01:07:30.245
Hello, I think my boss
is having a heart attack.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.447
Okay, is he breathing?

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:34.415
Yeah, he's conscious.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.151
What's your location?

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:38.953
We're at
the Traveler's Motel.

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:40.355
Okay, stay
with me, we have someone

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:41.489
on the way.

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:06.447
Is he gonna be okay?

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:10.051
You
called us just in time.

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:30.231
No offense, but
this Greg protagonist

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:32.233
is so unlikeable.

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.135
He's really
the shell of a human.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.638
He was just
frustratingly passive.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.706
Okay, your
story was jarring,

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.942
there's no passion
behind your work.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.277
I'm so sorry.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.711
It just
doesn't seem like

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:46.214
it's coming from anywhere
that feels real right now.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:48.116
It's just one school.

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:49.450
You got
to make it about you.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.752
Hey how's it
going, this is Greg Gifford.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.321
I too, as well, write.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.622
I am a writer.

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:55.657
So what do
you write about, Craig?

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:58.126
What are your demons?

01:09:58.128 --> 01:09:59.494
What are these?

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:01.396
Isolation, it's the distraction

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:04.465
that's the problem,
is distraction.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.835
There's no such thing
as writers block.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:10.638
Distraction...

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.273
Distraction.

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:02.617
You waited for me.

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:03.551
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:05.119
I never doubted you kid.

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.888
Fuck off, Harvey.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:07.789
Greg, please.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.224
You just had a
fucking heart attack,

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.259
what are you doing here?

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:12.693
Exactly.

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.430
And the only reason I am
here is because of you, man.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.300
Look, I know maybe
I've been a bit,

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.803
I've been a bit unreliable.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.237
Unreliable?

01:12:23.239 --> 01:12:25.606
Yeah, maybe you're still
pissed off about the whole

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:28.876
mom Visa thing, but this
heart attack has shown me

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:31.746
that maybe I don't got
a lot of chances left

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.014
to say I'm sorry,

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.651
and Greg, I'm sorry.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.455
Buddy, you're my lucky suit.

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:43.891
You don't believe me?

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.326
You don't believe me?!

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:46.194
All right,

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:48.463
all right.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:51.799
See that.

01:12:54.304 --> 01:12:57.171
Out with the old,
in with the new.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.277
What the fuck was
that supposed to prove?

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:08.249
I don't really know actually,
but god that felt great, eh?

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.485
So come on, what do you
say, we go to the Roxy?

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:16.123
I don't know.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.426
You know, Elijah
woulda followed through.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:21.362
You read my story?

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:22.196
Yeah, I did.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.667
Look, tonight's not
gonna be about me,

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.604
I want it to be about us.

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:32.340
I promise,

01:13:33.343 --> 01:13:34.208
please.

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:36.878
Yeah?

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:54.362
Yeah.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:09.377
Get you up in
a nice suit, man.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.373
Say, that looks spiffy.

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.375
I look like a
weight loss promo.

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:44.445
Yeah, one that
works.

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:56.357
Oh, oh, this is it, man.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:57.258
Yeah, this?

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.593
Yeah, this looks great.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:14:59.694
How's it feel?

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.695
It feels lucky.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:05.266
Look at us now, man,
we are legends baby.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.069
This place is packed, man.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.971
How the shit did you do that?

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:47.408
If you manage to get a result,
how you did so is futile.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.577
Shut up.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.279
Hey, how do I look?

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.582
Optimistically, decrepit.

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:55.483
Perfect, perfect.

01:15:55.485 --> 01:15:57.351
Okay, we can't go in this way,

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.120
we're gonna have to
find another way in.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:00.521
Go around back.

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:02.657
You do that, I have to
take care of something first,

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:04.125
but I'll meet you in there.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.327
All right, okay,
I'll see you in there.

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:31.185
Hey, Hannah.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.987
Hey, Greg right?

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:35.122
Yeah, sorry I couldn't
find you anywhere.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.224
You found me.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:38.292
I did.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:39.527
Uh, nice suit.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.311
So are you gonna come
in and watch the show?

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.647
Uh, yeah.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:02.316
I'm pretty much done setting
up here, so I'll come in

01:17:02.318 --> 01:17:03.451
once I'm finished.

01:17:04.887 --> 01:17:05.753
Cool.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.858
Okay, well goodbye.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:11.726
Bye.

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:20.301
It's time.

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:28.709
I thought this
was for a movie.

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:30.111
I don't know.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:38.853
Hello.

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:42.790
Hello.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:51.865
Hello!

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.867
Wow, I really wasn't
expecting this.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.071
Thank you all for coming.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.273
We are lucky tonight to
have Harvey McCoy here

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:03.277
to read a passage from his
book "The Grand Affliction".

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:07.248
So without further ado,
I'd like to introduce

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.315
Harvey McCoy.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:28.402
Hello everyone.

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:31.405
I wanna thank you
all for coming.

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:34.742
I'm very excited
to be here myself.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:40.581
15 years ago I wrote a book
called "The Grand Affliction",

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:43.818
it was written for my daughter,

01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:46.420
Hannah.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:51.759
I didn't ever get the
chance to know her

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.495
and that is my regret.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.432
And that is my book.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:05.472
I came here to make a grand
apology and I realized

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:09.343
that that's still just me being

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:10.377
in grand.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:13.881
But I'm not grand.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:19.520
There's a writer in this
room right now, though,

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:24.525
and he's listened to my grand
ramblings for three days now.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.728
And that, he's listening.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:33.767
It taught me more than 50
years of my own bullshit.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:40.074
And so, let's all
listen to a short story

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.376
from my good friend

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:44.378
Greg.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:15.242
I actually have something
else that I'd like to read.

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:16.410
I wrote this last night.

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:24.451
I've never read this aloud
before, so here it goes.

01:20:26.622 --> 01:20:29.857
This is called, "To
Hell with Harvey".

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:37.031
Warmth is an accident,
it is a thin atmosphere,

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.435
much like on earth
it surrounds us.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:45.506
It is a flimsy shroud, invisible
and lighter than a feather.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:52.313
It may be our friends,
our family, and our hope.

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:57.751
Thin and ephemeral,
and it can slip off us

01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:00.487
with a light force
of a cold drought.

01:21:01.657 --> 01:21:06.293
Some of us live without
it, live in the cold

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:07.161
and we tremble.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:14.234
That is me, who I am if
exposed all the time.

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:18.105
Everything hurts, but I
am convinced that I can

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:21.842
restore that blanket, that
shroud if I just stand still.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:25.346
If I open myself
up to a stranger.

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.350
If I try to be good.

01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:32.386
I doubt that I am good.

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:36.156
I pray that one day I will
do something that brings

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:37.024
people to me.

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:39.193
Warmth,

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:42.162
that's what will save me.

01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:04.411
What's this?

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:07.347
Greg, I got a bad
habit of burning bridges,

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:10.384
but one bridge I did not
burn was my publishers.

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:13.454
And I gave her your
story, and she loved it.

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:14.254
She did?

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:15.689
Oh yeah she did.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:18.759
Her phone numbers in there,
so make sure you call her.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.761
You're a great writer, Greg.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.362
So are you.

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:25.265
Nah, I'm just a character
in a novel.

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:27.801
Yeah, but you
wrote that novel.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:29.470
Well buddy, now
it's your turn.

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:31.972
What are you gonna do?

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:37.611
I'm gonna live
forever, man.

01:23:37.613 --> 01:23:40.314
Look, there's someone
over there waiting for ya.

01:24:35.493 --> 01:24:36.860
