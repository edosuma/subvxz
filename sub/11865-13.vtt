01:45.644 --> 01:46.791
When I was alive,

01:46.857 --> 01:50.256
I never bought the whole straighten-up and fly-right routine.

01:50.452 --> 01:52.335
I hated being told what to do,

01:52.636 --> 01:53.922
so it's pretty strange

01:53.984 --> 01:57.410
that now my job is to give everyone else their marching orders.

01:58.909 --> 02:01.710
Sure, I wanted to be a superhero when I was a kid,

02:02.026 --> 02:05.120
but only the guy superheroes got cool costumes--

02:05.349 --> 02:08.630
massive capes and scary masks and stuff.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.761
All wonderwoman got were hooker boots and a bathing suit.

02:12.824 --> 02:14.012
What the fuck was that about?

02:14.380 --> 02:16.223
My mom's a whore, my dad likes porn

02:16.279 --> 02:18.214
my mom's a whore, my dad likes porn

02:18.291 --> 02:20.032
my sister blows my brother's horn

02:20.089 --> 02:22.085
my sister blows my brother's horn

02:22.377 --> 02:25.098
Ah, the gentle art of poetry.

02:25.337 --> 02:26.156
All right, let's go.

02:26.252 --> 02:27.913
Move it, move it!

02:28.145 --> 02:29.010
Let's go, move it!

02:29.112 --> 02:31.320
Hit that wall, up and over, up and over.

02:33.342 --> 02:35.125
Do you want to fly with the brotherhood of the eagles,

02:35.166 --> 02:36.808
or do you want to slither with the worms?

02:36.864 --> 02:38.589
Sir, I want to fly with the eagles, sir.

02:38.647 --> 02:41.232
Then let me see you get up and over that wall, cadet. Now!

02:41.334 --> 02:43.223
Sir, I have to go to the bathroom, sir.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.861
I'll bet you do, Monteleone.

02:44.922 --> 02:47.069
The idea of that wall is scaring the piss out of you.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.653
No, sir. No fear, sir.

02:49.735 --> 02:52.418
We've never had a girl scale that wall before, Monteleone,

02:52.495 --> 02:53.861
I'm sure we never will.

02:53.927 --> 02:55.847
Sir, I will scale the wall, sir!

02:56.370 --> 02:58.090
You show these boys you mean business.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.417
Dismissed!

03:01.153 --> 03:02.625
Knock it off, ladies.

03:15.539 --> 03:17.217
I'm not scared of heights.

03:17.289 --> 03:19.788
I just have to catch my breath.

03:21.297 --> 03:23.064
I'm going to be the first girl over that wall.

03:24.419 --> 03:26.535
Even if it kills you, huh?

03:28.844 --> 03:29.749
Who the hell are you?

03:29.913 --> 03:32.473
I'm just... taking a tour.

03:32.857 --> 03:34.404
I think I might want to enlist.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.242
You don't enlist, you enroll.

03:36.779 --> 03:37.792
Anyway, you should.

03:37.865 --> 03:39.057
It changed my life.

03:41.285 --> 03:43.132
You have no idea.

03:45.384 --> 03:47.243
Permission to kick some ass now, sir!

03:47.310 --> 03:48.926
She's feisty, that one.

03:49.281 --> 03:50.523
I'm kind of rooting for her.

03:50.626 --> 03:54.416
Move it, girly. Up and over that wall now. Move it, move it. Move it!

03:55.108 --> 03:55.829
Come on.

03:56.147 --> 03:57.769
Here we go, you can do it.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.315
Ouch.

04:00.885 --> 04:02.985
Come on, pick yourself up. Let's go.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.010
You can do it.

04:18.201 --> 04:19.543
I knew you could do it.

04:20.350 --> 04:21.250
Whoo!

04:22.248 --> 04:24.237
Wow, good for you.

04:25.845 --> 04:27.827
First girl on top of this wall!

04:34.921 --> 04:36.775
And... not so good.

04:40.942 --> 04:42.180
Did you kill me?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.520
No, I took your soul before you died.

04:44.878 --> 04:48.785
Think of me as one of death's little lieutenants.

04:48.986 --> 04:52.256
- So, you're dead too?
- Dead and buried.

04:52.547 --> 04:55.092
So how did you end up here? You burn your parents' house down?

04:55.154 --> 04:58.487
I had to ace four tests to get in here. I was selected.

04:59.335 --> 05:01.189
Well, I was selected, too.

05:01.589 --> 05:02.234
Why?

05:03.038 --> 05:04.364
I don't know.

05:09.385 --> 05:12.968
So, do you have any superpowers? Can you fly?

05:13.578 --> 05:14.251
No.

05:14.429 --> 05:17.322
No flying, no leaping of buildings...

05:18.154 --> 05:19.603
no climbing walls.

05:19.926 --> 05:23.197
But we can drink as much tequila as we want without getting hung over.

05:24.627 --> 05:25.522
That's pretty cool.

05:29.756 --> 05:31.588
All right, one more time. What's the story?

05:33.237 --> 05:36.329
I broke up with Ray. That's our story.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.723
But I hit him on the head with a blunt object.

05:38.813 --> 05:41.475
Yeah, our story is, I dumped him.

05:41.547 --> 05:44.061
I dumped him, in your backyard, in a shallow grave.

05:44.209 --> 05:47.069
Is that what you want me to tell Rube? Fine.

05:47.156 --> 05:49.670
When you have to lie, you have to remember shit,

05:49.757 --> 05:52.513
and I really, really hate remembering shit.

05:52.583 --> 05:56.300
The key to successful lying is telling a simple yet elegant story, all right?

05:56.351 --> 05:59.526
It's like a little black dress-- short, simple, classic, unforgettable.

05:59.644 --> 06:01.036
Mm... bowling!

06:01.139 --> 06:04.379
I'll say I went bowling at the weekend when I was meant to be killing Ray.

06:04.528 --> 06:06.549
That is neither simple nor elegant.

06:06.647 --> 06:09.360
All right, this is not a joke. You killed a man.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.101
It was self-defense.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.581
The first blow to the head was self-defense.

06:14.653 --> 06:17.740
The three other blows after that was probably a little bit murderous, but--

06:17.945 --> 06:18.950
Are you trying to be funny?

06:19.036 --> 06:20.659
Yeah. No. I don't know. Sure. Why not?

06:20.752 --> 06:23.151
I haven't slept a wink since it happened.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.886
I am totally on edge, my nerves are totally fried.

06:25.973 --> 06:27.617
Oh my god, why didn't you say something earlier?

06:27.679 --> 06:31.983
I reaped this junkie housewife last week, and I hit the motherlode. Look.

06:32.234 --> 06:33.545
Diazepam,

06:34.227 --> 06:35.788
lorazapam...

06:35.942 --> 06:39.094
this is a gorilla tranquilizer that will be really fabulous.

06:39.565 --> 06:43.078
Mason! I don't want to be numb right now. We need to deal with this.

06:43.191 --> 06:43.828
Coffee?

06:44.114 --> 06:46.523
Yes, please, and keep it coming, Kiffany.

06:46.601 --> 06:47.260
Hello, Kiffany.

06:47.321 --> 06:49.477
Did you have a good weekend? I had a brilliant weekend. I went bowling.

06:49.737 --> 06:51.827
I'm a big bowler, I am. A great bowler.

06:51.898 --> 06:53.599
I was rolling, I was throwing,

06:53.665 --> 06:55.749
pins were flying everywhere, everywhere they were.

06:55.826 --> 06:59.019
I threw a... I bowled a 360.

07:00.705 --> 07:01.738
Good for you.

07:05.614 --> 07:06.756
You've wound me up now.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.707
You're going. Please don't go.

07:14.784 --> 07:17.143
Don't be clingy, it's unattractive. I'm going to powder my nose.

07:19.637 --> 07:21.223
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

07:23.723 --> 07:24.981
Oh, dad, ew.

07:26.645 --> 07:27.653
How are your pancakes?

07:27.898 --> 07:29.373
I should have gotten waffles.

07:29.656 --> 07:31.499
Reggie, don't drink coffee.

07:31.903 --> 07:33.034
I like it.

07:33.296 --> 07:34.294
Mom lets me.

07:35.107 --> 07:36.637
You know who used to really love coffee?

07:37.006 --> 07:38.901
Two sugars and a little milk.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.214
You sure you're going to be okay after school?

07:42.274 --> 07:43.073
Yes.

07:43.154 --> 07:45.094
I can call your mom, have her come early--

07:45.188 --> 07:45.724
Don't.

07:45.781 --> 07:46.565
The baby sitter--

07:46.641 --> 07:49.853
Alison alpert has been staying home alone since the fifth grade.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.495
I should call your mom and ask.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.148
She won't care, believe me.

07:54.162 --> 07:55.754
Anything else for you today?

07:55.857 --> 07:56.875
Just the check, please.

07:57.030 --> 07:59.036
Okay. Thank you.

08:00.596 --> 08:01.754
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.426
How's the coffee today?

08:07.519 --> 08:08.512
A little weak.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.329
Are you sitting or just standing guard?

08:22.391 --> 08:23.092
We're moving.

08:23.707 --> 08:24.889
You love this booth.

08:24.986 --> 08:27.413
Well, call me crazy, I need a little natural light today.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.819
Over by the window. Come on, march.

08:30.484 --> 08:31.431
Where's Daisy?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.419
I don't know.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.171
How am I supposed to know that?

08:35.660 --> 08:37.097
How am I to know everything?

08:37.263 --> 08:38.543
I can't remember everything.

08:38.753 --> 08:40.043
I can't remember anything.

08:40.105 --> 08:42.818
How should I know? Back the fuck up, Roxy. Jesus fucking christ.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.488
Where is she?

08:44.840 --> 08:45.787
Bathroom.

08:46.448 --> 08:47.620
You hitting the bottle already?

08:47.712 --> 08:48.608
Coffee.

08:49.008 --> 08:49.832
Irish?

08:50.267 --> 08:51.249
I'm English.

08:51.511 --> 08:54.020
So what's the deal with daisy and this Ray guy?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.263
That dead and buried?

08:57.177 --> 08:58.101
God damn it.

08:58.361 --> 09:00.358
These are my favorite pants, my shirt...

09:00.424 --> 09:02.128
What the fuck is the matter with you?

09:02.380 --> 09:03.869
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

09:05.797 --> 09:06.928
Is that necessary?

09:07.001 --> 09:09.593
Saliva has enzymes, breaks the shit down.

09:10.955 --> 09:12.823
We're over here, we're over here.

09:16.855 --> 09:17.753
That a girl.

09:17.856 --> 09:19.049
How'd the early reap go, huh?

09:19.158 --> 09:21.803
Good. Militant. Depressing.

09:22.622 --> 09:23.727
Another young one?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.929
Yeah. Strong and motivated.

09:26.287 --> 09:28.530
Reaping a winner makes me feel like a loser.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.761
I mean, I'm not a loser, I'm just...

09:30.829 --> 09:33.931
you know... alone and dead.

09:34.684 --> 09:36.864
Did anyone here ever serve in the military?

09:37.372 --> 09:38.519
No, nobody here did.

09:38.615 --> 09:40.755
I think Daisy serviced the army.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.362
I don't care for that kind of joke.

09:43.439 --> 09:45.317
You are that kind of joke.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.401
And since when are you Daisy's defender?

09:47.489 --> 09:48.276
Since always.

09:48.393 --> 09:51.830
Where is daisy, anyway? She's in some serious, fucking trouble.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.463
- She didn't do it.
- Do what?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.265
She didn't do that what you said she did.

09:55.371 --> 09:57.778
Well, somebody tracked mud in the house, and it wasn't me.

09:57.881 --> 09:59.544
And a good morning to you all.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.623
Yes, it's a jolly good day, isn't it?

10:01.696 --> 10:02.375
Yeah.

10:02.882 --> 10:03.968
Give her your chair.

10:05.883 --> 10:07.883
What the jolly hell is up with you two?

10:08.287 --> 10:11.150
All right, that's enough. I was bowling, all weekend.

10:11.237 --> 10:12.746
I'm in a bowling league. Did you know that?

10:12.825 --> 10:15.348
I'm a bowling league, and you can ask my fucking friend, Lester.

10:15.435 --> 10:16.613
Why would I do that?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.143
For you...

10:19.398 --> 10:20.084
You.

10:21.529 --> 10:22.531
And for you.

10:24.888 --> 10:26.467
The post-it is purple.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.638
I have multiples. What's that about?

10:28.879 --> 10:29.816
Affirmative action.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.075
Hardy-har-har.

10:31.277 --> 10:33.123
You'd better hope coffee comes out of these pants.

10:33.169 --> 10:35.503
These I value a little bit more than you, my friend.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.000
My post-it is purple.

10:41.135 --> 10:42.487
You're on my list, Mason.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.516
What list? Wha-wha-wha-- what list?

10:46.736 --> 10:50.182
My reap this morning asked me what I did on my last day on earth.

10:50.427 --> 10:53.364
My answer was so fucking boring, I could have died...

10:54.053 --> 10:54.927
again.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.688
- Why, what was it?
- I filed.

10:56.765 --> 10:58.081
Isn't that what you do now?

10:58.147 --> 11:01.194
If I had known it was my last day on earth, I would have...

11:02.236 --> 11:04.828
I have no idea.

11:04.919 --> 11:06.738
Would you have gotten really drunk and high?

11:06.810 --> 11:07.435
No.

11:07.511 --> 11:09.722
I would've found that bitch that killed me, and I would have--

11:09.768 --> 11:10.740
Killed her?

11:11.340 --> 11:12.512
Punished her.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.002
Big time.

11:14.193 --> 11:15.652
I would've gotten engaged.

11:15.738 --> 11:19.494
I always wanted someone to slip a pretty little diamond ring on my finger.

11:19.803 --> 11:21.604
I've got a purple post-it.

11:21.707 --> 11:24.753
Purple was my favorite color when I was a kid.

11:24.831 --> 11:28.398
Purple is the color of royalty and extravagance.

11:28.658 --> 11:31.160
Have you guys ever had a purple post-it? Have you guys--

11:31.282 --> 11:33.163
Just ask Rube about it.

11:33.226 --> 11:33.790
I will.

11:33.865 --> 11:34.833
- Don't.
- I won't.

11:34.957 --> 11:36.979
Daisy, you tracked mud in the house.

11:37.066 --> 11:39.323
What were you doing that was so muddy?

11:39.430 --> 11:40.275
Bowling!

11:41.397 --> 11:42.478
I'll clean it up.

11:42.723 --> 11:44.949
I'm leaving. Okay?

11:48.696 --> 11:50.059
There's no milk left.

11:50.806 --> 11:52.239
I've got a purple post-it.

11:52.490 --> 11:54.299
Nothing lasts forever.

11:54.753 --> 11:58.355
This was a lesson I learned over and over again...

11:59.141 --> 12:00.365
At Happy Time,

12:00.436 --> 12:03.109
at a temp agency, people definitely ncome and go.

12:03.175 --> 12:05.939
In fact, most days, you can't swing a dead cat

12:05.985 --> 12:08.038
without hitting a fucking goodbye party.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.177
Another office farewell, Delores?

12:11.247 --> 12:13.617
Yeah, can you believe Brian is leaving us already?

12:13.668 --> 12:17.197
- Only the good go so quickly.
- You don't have to tell me.

12:24.193 --> 12:25.490
Nice save, Millie.

12:25.757 --> 12:27.630
Yeah, that could've been ugly.

12:27.723 --> 12:29.874
Yeah, "the attack of the killer pinata."

12:31.215 --> 12:33.682
Misty, can you get me my stepladder, pumpkin?

12:33.964 --> 12:36.109
Pumpkin? She's your pumpkin?

12:36.184 --> 12:38.074
Nice hustle, Misty.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.381
Team player.

12:39.631 --> 12:42.032
So, Millie, can you help me with the party prep?

12:42.078 --> 12:45.411
I know it's not really your thing, but that bean dip isn't going to layer itself.

12:45.727 --> 12:49.235
Delores, don't you think just a good hearty handshake

12:49.286 --> 12:51.555
and "get out" would be good enough?

12:51.631 --> 12:52.414
Millie...

12:52.481 --> 12:56.239
Brian is hanging up his happy-time hat and riding off into the sunset,

12:56.301 --> 12:58.347
and I expect the appropriate show of emotion.

12:58.430 --> 12:59.505
I'm sorry, Delores.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.508
I just can't get it up for every Tom, Dick and Brian who decide to move on.

13:03.719 --> 13:05.649
Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.

13:05.746 --> 13:08.760
Well, if it makes a difference, I'm really going to miss you.

13:11.531 --> 13:14.438
Uh... Misty, that's not Brian.

13:15.192 --> 13:17.895
Oh... sorry.

13:18.304 --> 13:19.893
Shame on you, Ron.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.613
I'm Brian.

13:23.981 --> 13:26.844
And I'm really going to miss you too, Misty.

13:28.117 --> 13:29.102
Thank you.

13:33.401 --> 13:35.592
Look, Millie, I really need your help.

13:35.638 --> 13:36.759
I've got a lunch date, and I need

13:36.860 --> 13:39.463
to get things ready quickly, so can you pretend to care?

13:39.525 --> 13:41.409
What kind of lunch date?

13:41.486 --> 13:43.615
Love.com. I'm back on line, Millie.

13:43.661 --> 13:44.970
His name is Lionel.

13:45.064 --> 13:47.899
Smart, driven, types like a jackal.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.448
Well, I'm really happy for you, Delores.

13:51.519 --> 13:55.374
I just don't wt to look back one day and say "what if..."

13:55.482 --> 13:56.218
No.

13:57.432 --> 14:01.230
As in what if you went out to lunch one day and never came back?

14:01.844 --> 14:06.273
It was almost enough to make you understand the stupid fuss over goodbye parties...

14:07.856 --> 14:08.674
Almost.

14:08.989 --> 14:10.395
Go, sea turtles!

14:10.461 --> 14:11.613
Why am I here with you?

14:11.669 --> 14:12.495
Hold this.

14:12.606 --> 14:14.352
Oh, what, so I'm the coffee bloody table?

14:14.415 --> 14:15.663
If I say so.

14:16.030 --> 14:19.517
What is this, cricket, tennis, football?

14:19.707 --> 14:21.222
Who are you people, folks?

14:21.304 --> 14:22.255
We're sea turtles!

14:22.394 --> 14:24.463
Sea turtles, yeah!

14:24.596 --> 14:25.488
Fucking hell!

14:25.560 --> 14:28.184
Give em a little rah, rah, rah while I reap, reap, reap.

14:30.832 --> 14:31.574
Wait here.

14:45.376 --> 14:47.106
Sea turtles freak me out.

14:47.274 --> 14:48.134
Me too.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.107
A friend of mine was swimming across this creek

14:53.163 --> 14:55.288
and got his balls snapped off by a sea turtle.

14:57.540 --> 15:01.078
Sea creatures don't swim in the creek. They swim in the sea.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.515
Well, these are scary little fuckers, dude.

15:03.576 --> 15:04.370
Devious.

15:04.927 --> 15:07.653
The interesting part of that story

15:07.743 --> 15:10.441
is that your friend got his nuts clamped

15:10.554 --> 15:13.395
by a creature, a sea creature.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.141
I drive better when I'm high.

15:15.293 --> 15:16.360
I'll bet you do.

15:22.200 --> 15:22.901
Bye.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.879
Hey, you never told me went happened to Daisy and Ray.

15:30.936 --> 15:32.019
Like, post-mortem.

15:33.469 --> 15:35.363
Finished... ended, period.

15:36.197 --> 15:37.852
I thought she was in love.

15:38.922 --> 15:42.535
Go, sea turtles. Yeah, you kill them.

15:42.755 --> 15:43.795
She dumped him.

15:44.203 --> 15:44.859
Why?

15:44.931 --> 15:46.605
She's secretly in love with me.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.246
Now, that I do not follow.

15:50.908 --> 15:51.899
Go, turtles.

15:52.006 --> 15:52.748
Snap!

16:26.463 --> 16:28.647
What do you want to do today? We're all alone.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.219
You know what this means...

16:31.314 --> 16:32.839
Rocky road, your favorite.

16:33.838 --> 16:34.614
Reggie.

16:35.806 --> 16:37.012
J.D, shh.

16:42.570 --> 16:43.852
Reggie, can you open up?

16:46.478 --> 16:49.432
- Hi, mrs. Henican.
- Hi. Call me Claire.

16:50.067 --> 16:50.803
Why?

16:50.993 --> 16:52.278
Because I asked you to, dear.

16:52.329 --> 16:53.695
I didn't see your mom come home,

16:53.773 --> 16:57.038
and I heard the music, and I just wondered if everything was all right.

16:57.465 --> 17:00.720
She's visiting my grandma, and I'm allowed to be alone.

17:00.859 --> 17:02.031
She'll be home tonight.

17:02.157 --> 17:03.903
Oh, no. Should he be eating that?

17:04.017 --> 17:05.454
Dogs don't do well with chocolate.

17:05.972 --> 17:07.012
It's low-fat.

17:07.438 --> 17:09.827
Sweetheart, I know how painful divorce can be,

17:09.905 --> 17:13.058
so if you ever feel isolated, you knock on my door.

17:13.315 --> 17:15.050
Just don't take my toilet seat.

17:15.372 --> 17:18.220
Can you close the gate behind you so J.D. doesn't get out?

17:18.505 --> 17:22.053
Are you sure you want to let him eat that? It's very bad for dogs.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.589
Thanks for stopping by, Claire.

17:38.449 --> 17:40.523
- What kind of food is this?
- Frontier.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.088
I was up all night simmering these franks and beans.

17:44.426 --> 17:47.900
Had a real scare with Murray and a teenie piece of weenie.

17:47.952 --> 17:49.621
Had to heimlich the poor guy.

17:50.468 --> 17:51.926
Crystal, how are the beans?

17:52.002 --> 17:52.668
Great.

17:54.209 --> 17:55.044
Brian...

17:55.493 --> 17:56.221
Millie.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.122
Brian, it's supposed to be a surprise. Get out.

17:59.649 --> 18:00.371
Right.

18:00.689 --> 18:01.872
Sorry, Delores.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.268
I just wanted to say thank you.

18:04.539 --> 18:06.285
You know, when I left pizza hut,

18:06.351 --> 18:10.177
all they gave me was a small meat lover's supreme and my name tag.

18:11.017 --> 18:13.647
This means so much to me.

18:14.835 --> 18:15.869
Okay, I'm gonna...

18:17.047 --> 18:19.632
- He's so full of shit.
- And why so cynical?

18:19.728 --> 18:20.999
Because he's a turd.

18:26.364 --> 18:27.885
What do you have against Brian?

18:27.967 --> 18:29.394
Because when I first met him...

18:29.481 --> 18:33.049
He... here's how he shook my hand. Pretend you're me.

18:34.331 --> 18:35.595
Exactly.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.581
Ever since then, I haven't trusted him.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.038
And you know what they say about people with weak handshakes?

18:40.202 --> 18:41.056
Small gloves?

18:41.134 --> 18:42.146
Don't trust them.

18:42.398 --> 18:43.795
You know what, Millie...

18:44.795 --> 18:49.157
people have one chance to make a first impression and one chance to make a last.

18:49.218 --> 18:52.259
The way we say goodbye to people matters.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.681
People remember their last day,

18:53.728 --> 18:56.662
and Brian is going to remember his, and you can be a part of it or not.

18:58.141 --> 18:59.840
Clammy handshakes...

19:00.081 --> 19:01.810
give me the fucking creeps.

19:04.499 --> 19:05.678
Nice, Crystal.

19:05.877 --> 19:08.549
Dry, strong, trustworthy, loyal.

19:14.681 --> 19:17.958
What is on your hand? Motor oil? Peanut butter.

19:18.260 --> 19:19.771
That is one filthy paw.

19:19.887 --> 19:21.767
Come on, it's only blood, it's not like it's mine.

19:21.909 --> 19:24.230
Kiffany, Kiffany, Kiffany, please read it.

19:25.100 --> 19:25.783
No.

19:26.134 --> 19:28.520
George says that you're a palm reader.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.306
You know, she said that you're...

19:31.653 --> 19:34.156
- Psychotic.
- I'm not psychic..

19:34.904 --> 19:35.901
I think you are.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.380
- I have tables.
- I'll give you 10 bucks.

19:38.794 --> 19:40.489
You only have two in your pocket.

19:44.820 --> 19:48.680
Wow. Is it my last day?

19:48.803 --> 19:51.700
If I don't take care of my customers, it's going to be mine.

20:25.269 --> 20:26.903
On your last day on Earth,

20:27.050 --> 20:29.630
they say you'll see a crescent moon in the daylight.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.455
You see a crescent moon?

20:32.032 --> 20:34.541
All I see is the same old overcast sky.

20:52.603 --> 20:54.267
Open up, police.

20:56.236 --> 20:57.040
Roxy.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.061
Don't do that.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.669
To what do I owe the forced entry?

21:06.482 --> 21:07.719
Police business.

21:09.445 --> 21:12.394
That is quite an impressive guy you were seeing.

21:13.382 --> 21:16.253
Fraud, assault, bad haircut.

21:19.025 --> 21:21.332
Yeah, so he was a bad guy.

21:22.645 --> 21:24.301
He's gone. Who cares?

21:24.368 --> 21:27.240
The people at his job care. They reported him missing.

21:28.029 --> 21:30.046
Well, then he's no longer a threat to me.

21:30.128 --> 21:31.294
I never said he was.

21:31.582 --> 21:32.862
I'm done with him.

21:34.116 --> 21:37.136
If you don't mind, I'd like to catch up on my magazines, so...

21:40.014 --> 21:41.476
Looks like dried blood.

21:41.554 --> 21:43.299
We inherited this house from Mason,

21:43.407 --> 21:45.752
and he inherited it from a dead woman, so...

21:45.833 --> 21:47.387
that must have been where she died.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.430
Yeah, maybe.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.305
You leave it there long enough, it'll last forever.

21:53.287 --> 21:55.582
That rug's been there a long time, Roxy.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.875
Haven't we all?

22:01.981 --> 22:03.184
See you around.

22:08.524 --> 22:09.902
It's time.

22:10.173 --> 22:14.083
Who would like to tell Brian there's a "package" for him?

22:14.145 --> 22:14.949
I would.

22:15.063 --> 22:18.230
I would love to tell Brian there's a package waiting for him to unwrap.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.443
Millie... you tell him.

22:21.297 --> 22:25.644
I don't know why I had such a big bug up my ass about Brian's farewell party.

22:25.981 --> 22:28.966
Maybe it's because I was regretting my own last day.

22:29.207 --> 22:35.113
Maybe it's because... he was stealing Delores' wallet.

22:35.509 --> 22:38.765
- I was just looking for a pen.
- In Delores' wallet?

22:39.764 --> 22:40.950
Look, a pterodactyl!

22:41.294 --> 22:43.454
Please tell me I didn't just fall for that.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.320
Man down!

23:06.423 --> 23:08.734
Millie... what is going on?

23:09.078 --> 23:10.312
Why don't you ask...

23:11.133 --> 23:12.141
Brian!

23:13.772 --> 23:14.811
She attacked me.

23:15.057 --> 23:16.894
He was trying to steal your wallet.

23:17.136 --> 23:19.541
No, no, I wasn't.

23:19.686 --> 23:23.289
Have you ever heard the sound of a rib cracking, Brian?

23:23.375 --> 23:26.065
- It sounds real cool.
- I stole it, I stole it.

23:28.783 --> 23:32.923
Delores was trying to do something nice for you, and you took advantage of her.

23:38.949 --> 23:40.316
I'm diabetic.

23:41.627 --> 23:42.969
So the hell what?

23:44.683 --> 23:45.656
I don't know.

23:46.158 --> 23:50.027
- May I do the honors, Delores?
- Please, but watch the language.

23:50.463 --> 23:54.937
Get the f out before I kick your f-in' a again.

24:01.503 --> 24:03.760
You know, Delores, you think you know someone...

24:03.836 --> 24:05.018
I know.

24:05.524 --> 24:07.829
I had no idea he was a diabetic.

24:07.884 --> 24:09.843
I would have gotten him a special cake.

24:13.881 --> 24:15.375
Mom is going to be so pissed.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.871
Yeah, too much ice cream.

24:26.335 --> 24:28.670
Oh! J.D!

24:28.834 --> 24:30.411
Oh, I'm going to be in so much trouble.

24:30.462 --> 24:32.463
Come on, you're going outside. Now.

24:40.545 --> 24:41.919
How much?

24:44.177 --> 24:47.341
I'm not going to let that go for any less than $20.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.129
That's sentimental value, that is.

24:49.456 --> 24:51.134
It really is, it means a lot to me.

24:51.646 --> 24:53.064
All right, $15...

24:54.714 --> 24:57.468
Bloody hell, you drive a hard bargain... $10, hand it over.

24:58.108 --> 24:59.756
And smile once in a while.

25:00.644 --> 25:03.631
Come on, you lovely people, get your bargains, everything must go.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.039
- Hello, father.
- Hello.

25:05.413 --> 25:06.872
How much for the incense burner?

25:07.405 --> 25:10.619
For you, father, that incense burner... $5.00.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.017
May the lord bake with you.

25:13.456 --> 25:17.037
- Would you bless me?
- I don't think so.

25:19.002 --> 25:20.193
That seems fair.

25:21.718 --> 25:24.120
- Excuse me...
- Coming, madame.

25:24.617 --> 25:25.374
Hello.

25:25.497 --> 25:27.395
So, what are these holes?

25:27.482 --> 25:30.262
Oh, is a really, really bloody funny story, right...

25:30.354 --> 25:32.510
They're actually gunshot wounds, and...

25:33.324 --> 25:34.743
Actually, that's really sad.

25:35.147 --> 25:36.710
I've got a really good deal for you.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.084
I'm going to give you all this set for $50.

25:39.237 --> 25:42.243
And...bargain of the century, I'm going to throw in...

25:42.330 --> 25:44.673
Ta-dah! The kitchen guillotine.

25:44.735 --> 25:46.439
Now, it slices, it dices,

25:46.506 --> 25:48.462
it'll cut your bloody hand off it will, yeah?

25:50.059 --> 25:50.735
No?

25:51.257 --> 25:52.313
Come on.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.253
If it makes you feel any better,

25:54.431 --> 25:58.256
this bloke who was murdered on this mattress was really lovely, he was.

25:58.345 --> 25:59.935
What is this? What are you doing?

26:00.786 --> 26:02.301
Uh, having a lawn sale.

26:02.684 --> 26:03.754
It's my lawn.

26:04.471 --> 26:07.246
Since when was it illegal to have a lawn sale on somebody else's lawn?

26:07.364 --> 26:08.587
Since forever.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.047
Really?

26:11.755 --> 26:14.071
I'll give you the whole lot for $250.

26:14.162 --> 26:15.452
I am calling the police.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.677
I don't need this shit.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.579
Well, cake looked good.

26:41.132 --> 26:42.115
What kind was it?

26:42.857 --> 26:44.024
German chocolate.

26:44.126 --> 26:47.195
- They had coconut in Dodge City?
- I'm on a budget, Millie.

26:47.331 --> 26:53.194
And german chocolate is more than that diabetic p-r-i-c-k deserved.

26:53.270 --> 26:54.438
At least he didn't get the money.

26:54.509 --> 26:55.897
It's not about the money.

26:56.004 --> 26:57.729
It just wasn't the goodbye that I had in mind

26:57.791 --> 27:00.883
when Murray and I we up slaving over this frosting last night.

27:01.676 --> 27:02.668
One of these days,

27:02.721 --> 27:04.733
I'm going to bake a cake with your name on it.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.599
Oh... I don't know.

27:07.728 --> 27:09.135
I can't bear to think about it.

27:11.573 --> 27:15.876
I was beginning to understand why we mark every coming and going with a party.

27:16.175 --> 27:19.093
We do it to sugar coat the whole moving on thing.

27:19.508 --> 27:20.270
I mean,

27:20.675 --> 27:24.965
why say an actual goodbye to someone when it's so much easier to just eat cake?

27:25.271 --> 27:26.039
Hello.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.597
What are you doing here? And how did you get cake?

27:30.714 --> 27:31.374
Crystal.

27:34.257 --> 27:34.812
Hello.

27:39.428 --> 27:40.539
Why are you here?

27:40.621 --> 27:42.232
I came to see your lovely face.

27:42.402 --> 27:45.084
I have work to do, Mason. What do you need, money?

27:45.689 --> 27:48.960
Of course, I need money, but that's not why I'm here.

27:49.082 --> 27:51.945
For what? Drugs? Booze? Drugs and booze?

27:52.017 --> 27:52.953
No, actually, I want--

27:53.127 --> 27:56.465
Seriously, Mason, you're not supposed to be here, so... go away!

27:56.609 --> 27:57.393
God.

28:01.406 --> 28:03.115
Actually, you know what? I'm going to stay.

28:03.248 --> 28:06.264
And I want to say something to you, and you've got to listen... please.

28:07.390 --> 28:11.900
You know, this morning, when you said you spend your last day on earth,

28:11.968 --> 28:14.651
your very, very last day on earth... stapling?

28:14.757 --> 28:15.761
Filing.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.746
My god, that's even worse.

28:18.089 --> 28:19.729
You said you regretted it, didn't you?

28:19.785 --> 28:21.509
Yeah, of course. Who gives a shit?

28:22.125 --> 28:23.788
By god, I give a shit.

28:23.890 --> 28:27.611
Rube tells us to be on the periphery, to keep away from... things.

28:27.673 --> 28:28.943
Keep our distance from...

28:29.832 --> 28:30.704
life...

28:31.559 --> 28:32.860
our families.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.570
Yeah?

28:35.158 --> 28:36.719
God, it's nonsense.

28:38.276 --> 28:39.608
You get close.

28:40.017 --> 28:44.123
You get close to everybody that ever meant anything to you.

28:44.727 --> 28:46.210
Have you been drinking?

28:46.693 --> 28:48.667
Of course, I've bloody been drinking.

28:48.730 --> 28:50.051
And it's last call.

28:51.658 --> 28:52.616
You've got to...

28:53.025 --> 28:55.007
you've got to drink up while you still can.

29:01.739 --> 29:03.489
I really love you, Georgie.

29:05.987 --> 29:07.181
It's going to be all right.

29:08.491 --> 29:10.211
Come on, go for a ride.

29:16.011 --> 29:19.013
I don't exactly know what Mason was talking about,

29:19.416 --> 29:22.031
why he said I should get close to people...

29:22.732 --> 29:25.346
why he told me he loved me...

29:27.337 --> 29:29.563
maybe it was just the booze talking--

29:29.997 --> 29:31.871
"in vino veritas."

29:36.035 --> 29:39.355
I just knew it was time to check in with my old life.

29:48.647 --> 29:49.774
J.D.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.196
I knew it was time to go home.

29:52.436 --> 29:53.369
Where are you?

29:55.416 --> 29:56.404
Here, boy.

29:57.259 --> 29:58.728
It's time to come home.

30:03.438 --> 30:04.694
I'm not here.

30:05.461 --> 30:08.487
Well, that's strange, because I can hear your voice, my darling.

30:10.879 --> 30:13.816
You can't hear me. You're hearing voices in your head.

30:16.204 --> 30:18.705
That, my dear, is so bloody true it's scary.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.363
Not today, Mason.

30:21.256 --> 30:25.779
Today is the day it has to be, I'm afraid.

30:26.010 --> 30:27.233
Can I have a drink? Thanks.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.922
Roxy knows about Ray.

30:33.909 --> 30:36.086
Shit. How the hell does she know?

30:36.346 --> 30:37.406
Well, she's smart.

30:38.353 --> 30:39.384
I think she knows something.

30:39.454 --> 30:42.668
I think someone knows something.

30:42.863 --> 30:45.736
I don't bloody care. The deed is done.

30:45.812 --> 30:46.825
You should care, Mason.

30:46.908 --> 30:48.173
It was a death without a post-it.

30:48.238 --> 30:50.344
We've let loose some kind of evil.

30:52.472 --> 30:53.717
All right, Daisy.

31:00.069 --> 31:00.987
Look at me.

31:03.900 --> 31:04.843
I did it.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.904
And you didn't.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.182
Well, someone's going to pay.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.443
You are so beautiful to look at.

31:13.699 --> 31:16.038
And unlucky to know.

31:29.567 --> 31:32.037
- That's an engagement ring.
- Yeah.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.517
You wanted one, so I got it for you.

31:37.603 --> 31:41.097
You wanted to put it on your little finger on your last day, so...

31:41.989 --> 31:42.772
here it is.

31:44.011 --> 31:45.883
Are you trying to humiliate me?

31:46.442 --> 31:47.215
No.

31:48.748 --> 31:49.745
Never.

31:51.434 --> 31:53.682
This is a token, Daisy,

31:53.764 --> 31:56.005
it is a token from me, from my heart.

31:56.077 --> 31:58.120
To you. You.

31:58.822 --> 32:01.299
There's something permanent in this bloody world.

32:08.370 --> 32:10.217
Mason, I'm not this girl.

32:13.451 --> 32:14.835
I won't fall in love.

32:15.522 --> 32:16.987
I won't get married.

32:17.242 --> 32:19.100
I won't grow old with someone.

32:20.207 --> 32:21.843
Not with you or anyone.

32:27.317 --> 32:28.945
So I don't want your ring.

32:31.302 --> 32:33.301
And I will never, ever take it back.

32:44.093 --> 32:45.307
Please go.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.816
J.D.

33:09.236 --> 33:10.665
I would never grow up,

33:11.263 --> 33:12.813
and I would never get old,

33:13.668 --> 33:14.846
but my sister...

33:15.772 --> 33:17.012
she was changing--

33:17.548 --> 33:19.627
growing taller, moving on--

33:20.288 --> 33:22.038
and it was kind of comforting.

33:24.093 --> 33:25.749
Death may have found me,

33:26.288 --> 33:27.629
but she seemed okay.

33:29.538 --> 33:31.449
Hey, Charlie.

33:31.755 --> 33:32.795
Toilet-seat girl.

33:33.541 --> 33:34.254
Funny.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.081
What are you doing here?

33:36.276 --> 33:37.070
You know...

33:37.520 --> 33:38.355
my job.

33:42.082 --> 33:42.844
No.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.762
Look, I'll give you money.

33:46.854 --> 33:49.193
Come on, kid, what do you want? You can't do this.

33:49.792 --> 33:50.694
Too late.

34:01.603 --> 34:02.729
J.D.

34:16.373 --> 34:17.928
I shouldn't have come here.

34:19.659 --> 34:21.333
This was all my fault.

34:33.743 --> 34:35.234
Well, this is it then.

35:11.050 --> 35:12.427
My dog died.

35:12.670 --> 35:14.002
You don't have a dog.

35:14.335 --> 35:16.664
My family's dog died.

35:16.813 --> 35:18.369
You don't have a family.

35:18.447 --> 35:19.839
Shut up, daisy.

35:21.190 --> 35:22.469
It's just, um...

35:24.263 --> 35:26.960
it's that kind of day. So your dog died.

35:27.129 --> 35:29.372
I don't even know why I went back home.

35:29.939 --> 35:32.141
Because Mason told me to.

35:32.365 --> 35:34.803
You shouldn't listen to Mason. Mason doesn't know anything.

35:35.095 --> 35:36.656
It's all my fault.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.277
I don't think it is.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.035
Well, then, whose fault is it?

35:43.368 --> 35:44.504
Probably mine.

35:49.833 --> 35:50.632
What is that?

35:50.729 --> 35:52.880
Go away. Ray, go away!

35:53.099 --> 35:55.471
Daisy, why is there a graveling?

35:55.767 --> 35:57.176
Mason killed Ray.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.704
So Mason had his post-it?

36:00.475 --> 36:02.740
No one had a post-it. There was no post-it.

36:03.159 --> 36:06.341
And bad things have been happening today, and it's all my fault.

36:06.610 --> 36:09.348
So I'm sorry about your dog, babe. It's my fault.

36:17.908 --> 36:19.480
What can I do for you, sweetie?

36:20.110 --> 36:20.879
Nothing.

36:22.758 --> 36:24.108
How about some ice cream?

36:26.290 --> 36:28.757
No. I want mom.

36:29.694 --> 36:31.056
She'll be back soon.

36:32.801 --> 36:34.440
She's gonna kill me.

36:35.342 --> 36:37.129
No one's killing anyone.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.750
It's not your fault, sweetie.

36:41.986 --> 36:43.516
It's Claire's fault.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.301
Claire from next door?

36:48.079 --> 36:49.656
She left the gate open.

36:52.814 --> 36:53.956
I'm gonna kill her.

37:17.396 --> 37:18.750
Hey there, stranger.

37:18.950 --> 37:19.680
Hello.

37:20.495 --> 37:22.118
Can I interest you in the catch of the day?

37:22.497 --> 37:23.706
No thank you.

37:24.298 --> 37:26.597
But this smells good, though, whatever this is.

37:27.811 --> 37:28.784
Well, have a seat.

37:28.963 --> 37:30.688
I've got lots of room, I've got lots of food.

37:32.213 --> 37:33.914
It's the second rule of backpacking,

37:34.630 --> 37:36.381
that you always bring enough for a friend.

37:37.287 --> 37:38.643
What's the first rule?

37:39.033 --> 37:40.211
That you make a friend.

37:40.866 --> 37:42.355
I'm Bret Tanenbaum.

37:42.421 --> 37:43.942
I'm Mason. Very nice to meet you.

37:44.030 --> 37:47.551
Well, Mason, the house specialty tonight is chicken noodle soup, and...

37:49.558 --> 37:50.375
well, that's it.

37:52.584 --> 37:53.434
Looks good.

37:54.177 --> 37:55.459
Are you coming or are you going?

37:56.547 --> 37:57.426
I'm not sure.

37:58.143 --> 37:58.835
Yeah.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.814
Sometimes, all this beauty does that to me, too.

38:03.043 --> 38:05.439
The great outdoors has a way of scrambling your brain.

38:06.390 --> 38:09.500
Bret, I've done most of my brain scrambling indoors, actually.

38:12.274 --> 38:13.732
Are you scared of wild animals?

38:16.363 --> 38:17.019
No.

38:18.294 --> 38:19.677
I'm not really scared of anything.

38:20.439 --> 38:21.334
You should be.

38:22.646 --> 38:25.078
Mm. Delicious.

38:27.836 --> 38:29.511
No. Thank you.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.887
Oh, lovely.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.740
So you're not scared of anything?

38:36.843 --> 38:39.044
Well, I won't go swimming once it's dark.

38:39.562 --> 38:40.794
That's kind of spooky.

38:41.229 --> 38:42.842
Yeah, spooky, man.

38:43.314 --> 38:44.373
Spooky...

38:47.681 --> 38:50.624
What if I were to tell you this was your last day on Earth?

38:50.962 --> 38:52.017
What would you say?

38:53.290 --> 38:55.392
Well, I would say that that's a very strange question.

38:57.521 --> 38:58.758
What would you say?

39:00.243 --> 39:02.997
Well, I would say that I would sit under the wide open sky,

39:03.060 --> 39:05.353
and I would fish, and

39:05.793 --> 39:08.132
I would go for a swim before it got dark,

39:08.332 --> 39:10.242
which is exactly what I'm doing today.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.462
It's your last day on Earth.

39:17.839 --> 39:20.414
Do you want to tell me what the hell you're talking about?

39:21.823 --> 39:23.599
It's my last day, too.

39:31.279 --> 39:32.754
What can I get you this evening?

39:35.277 --> 39:38.190
- I'll have a scotch?
- Wish I could, sweetheart.

39:38.449 --> 39:40.115
Coffee then, please.

39:42.553 --> 39:44.500
I don't know how you do it.

39:44.624 --> 39:46.186
- Do what?
- Your job.

39:46.446 --> 39:47.629
The scrawny one?

39:47.732 --> 39:49.590
He committed a lewd act today.

39:50.071 --> 39:50.938
On who?

39:51.025 --> 39:53.157
A perfectly innocent coconut cake.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.093
I'll take care of it.

39:55.272 --> 39:56.973
Well, you know what they say.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.607
You don't get to pick your family.

40:03.004 --> 40:03.695
No.

40:06.842 --> 40:09.056
There's your first initial, your last name,

40:09.194 --> 40:11.367
the place, and the time. That's all we get.

40:11.563 --> 40:13.134
That's not a lot to go on.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.681
No, it isn't.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.949
I don't know if there's a way of pointing things out quite simply.

40:20.061 --> 40:23.435
Because a purple post-it note tells me I'm going to die.

40:23.523 --> 40:24.930
No, I'm sorry, I can't believe that.

40:25.028 --> 40:27.695
I do not understand this, but they're not usually purple.

40:27.736 --> 40:29.584
This is the first one I've ever seen. They're usually yellow.

40:29.656 --> 40:31.171
And what do you think that means?

40:32.005 --> 40:33.797
Fucked if I know.

40:36.506 --> 40:39.914
But one thing I'm pretty sure of is that you're going to die tonight,

40:39.976 --> 40:41.467
and I'm so sorry.

40:43.930 --> 40:45.363
So how am I going to die?

40:45.440 --> 40:48.260
Wild animals, hunter... bad aim.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.393
I mean how am I going to die?

40:53.262 --> 40:55.370
With grace, I suspect.

41:03.865 --> 41:04.990
What did you just do?

41:05.036 --> 41:06.552
Whatever happens to you tonight, mate,

41:06.634 --> 41:09.173
you will not feel a thing, so don't be afraid.

41:09.705 --> 41:10.704
I'm not afraid.

41:11.463 --> 41:13.411
I just don't know what to hope for.

41:13.616 --> 41:15.142
Hope for another shot at it.

41:16.478 --> 41:19.197
A chance to do it all fucking unafraid.

41:28.914 --> 41:30.338
I'm going to go for a swim.

42:20.745 --> 42:22.678
So what's the deal with this guy? You think he's gone?

42:22.940 --> 42:25.220
He's gone. Trust me.

42:25.429 --> 42:29.027
I do not mind saying that I did not like this guy.

42:29.196 --> 42:32.068
I'm thinking you'll never have to see him again.

42:33.260 --> 42:35.426
- Never have to see who again?
- Ray.

42:35.845 --> 42:38.877
- He was last seen in Portland.
- Portland?

42:39.183 --> 42:40.802
So you're off the hook, aren't you, Daisy?

42:40.945 --> 42:43.383
- What does that mean?
- No more Ray to worry about.

42:43.641 --> 42:45.721
Yeah, that's right. No more Ray.

42:46.217 --> 42:47.053
Morning.

42:49.988 --> 42:51.135
Why the face?

42:51.184 --> 42:52.239
Leave me alone.

42:52.362 --> 42:53.754
Her family dog died.

42:53.892 --> 42:55.233
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

42:55.299 --> 42:56.569
Well I'd ask you how you know that but--

42:56.636 --> 42:57.671
But you won't.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.883
Well, maybe I'll ask you tomorrow.

42:59.139 --> 43:00.189
Tomorrow.

43:02.114 --> 43:03.849
Well you look like you're at death's door.

43:03.993 --> 43:06.240
- How'd your reap go?
- Swimmingly.

43:07.008 --> 43:08.017
Lake...

43:08.202 --> 43:09.246
lightning...

43:11.195 --> 43:12.455
man...

43:13.162 --> 43:14.380
gone in an instant.

43:14.949 --> 43:16.290
Better him than you.

43:16.858 --> 43:18.784
- Do you really think so?
- I do.

43:18.993 --> 43:20.699
I've got a question to ask you.

43:21.327 --> 43:21.988
Shoot.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.840
You gave me a purple post-it.

43:23.923 --> 43:24.999
That's not a question.

43:25.131 --> 43:27.353
Why did you give me a purple post-it?

43:30.865 --> 43:32.503
They were out of yellow at office hut.

43:35.257 --> 43:36.108
For you.

43:37.386 --> 43:38.175
You.

43:39.498 --> 43:40.254
You.

43:44.336 --> 43:45.528
Have fun, kiddies.

43:49.986 --> 43:51.470
You should thank Roxy.

43:51.978 --> 43:54.066
- Really? Why?
- Just thank her.

43:56.841 --> 43:59.595
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:59.990 --> 44:02.462
Would you give me a ride to my reap?

44:03.276 --> 44:04.332
Sure.

44:05.144 --> 44:06.670
But you have to sit in the back.

44:06.763 --> 44:07.638
Okay.

44:15.626 --> 44:16.664
I'll talk to you.

44:25.133 --> 44:27.972
Could you buy me a coffee, please? I've got no money.

44:29.135 --> 44:30.569
I haven't got anything.

44:30.850 --> 44:31.930
No problem.

44:32.712 --> 44:34.526
I have nowhere to stay...

44:34.953 --> 44:36.608
No problem.

44:36.958 --> 44:40.014
I have no idea how long I'll be staying.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.113
I know.

44:44.360 --> 44:48.829
So maybe we don't know what the exact sign will be that tells us we're moving on,

44:49.761 --> 44:52.111
but there will be a last reap.

44:55.558 --> 44:58.383
"Stop noticing," that's what Rube says.

44:59.074 --> 45:00.691
That's how you survive.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.767
But Mason's right,

45:04.106 --> 45:05.837
what Rube says is bullshit.

45:07.331 --> 45:10.614
You should get close  to everything you care about.

45:13.833 --> 45:15.364
Things come and go,

45:17.451 --> 45:19.030
people come and go...

45:23.863 --> 45:26.847
and maybe some of us learn to stop caring about it.

45:33.758 --> 45:38.023
But I keep reaching out, even though my hand keeps getting slapped away.

45:40.540 --> 45:41.970
When my sister was little,

45:42.064 --> 45:44.904
she used to close her eyes every time she wanted to hide.

45:45.523 --> 45:47.597
She thought that made her disappear.

45:53.998 --> 45:55.215
When you get older,

45:56.285 --> 45:59.550
you learn that closing your eyes just makes it darker.

46:00.917 --> 46:02.530
You have to face everything,

46:03.370 --> 46:04.613
even death,

46:04.879 --> 46:06.386
if you want to grow up.

46:06.561 --> 46:07.956
Hello, mr. Frog.
