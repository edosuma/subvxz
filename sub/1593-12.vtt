00:27.069 --> 00:30.061
(Judith babbles)

00:31.616 --> 00:35.154
- ( rattles )
- ( animal squeals)

00:46.088 --> 00:47.589
We brought dinner.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.091
Aaron:
It's okay.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.923
Come on in, guys.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.628
Before we take this
any further,

01:29.799 --> 01:31.915
I need you all
to turn over your weapons.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.293
Stay, you hand them over.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.336
We don't know
if we want to stay.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.255
It's fine, Nicholas.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.721
If we were gonna use them,
we would have started already.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.851
Aaron: Let them talk
to Deanna first.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.432
Who's Deanna?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.394
She knows everything
you'd wanna know about this place.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.947
Rick, why don't you start?

01:55.366 --> 01:58.233
(walker snarling )

01:58.411 --> 02:00.322
Sasha.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.914
(gunshot)

02:12.383 --> 02:14.624
It's a good thing we're here.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.676
(theme music playing )

03:03.351 --> 03:05.387
Hello.

03:05.561 --> 03:06.971
l'm Deanna Monroe.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.727
Rick Grimes.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.147
- You mind if | film this?
- What?

03:12.318 --> 03:14.684
Do you mind if | film ourtalk?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.978
Go ahead.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.817
- Rick: Why film this?
- ( camera beeps )

03:23.954 --> 03:26.240
Deanna: We're about
transparency here.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.830
Please.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.665
How long have you
been out there?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.579
Since the beginning.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.089
How did you all find each other?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.669
Did you know each other
before or--?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.960
We didn't know
each other before.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.220
I was a congressperson.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.357
Ohio, 15th district.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.483
You?

03:56.654 --> 03:58.519
I don't think
it matters anymore.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.358
Oh, I know it does.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.775
What is this place?

04:03.953 --> 04:06.740
This is the start of sustainability.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.155
That's what the brochures
we found say.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.494
This was a planned community

04:11.669 --> 04:15.161
with its own solar grid,
cisterns,

04:15.339 --> 04:18.081
eco-based sewage filtration.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.376
Starting in the low 800,000s...

04:21.554 --> 04:24.387
( laughs)
...if there is such a thing.

04:24.557 --> 04:26.297
And they sold them all.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.011
How did you end up here?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.801
Well, my family and l were
trying to get back to Ohio

04:30.980 --> 04:33.892
so I could help my district
manage the crisis.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.806
And...

04:35.985 --> 04:37.350
( sighs )
...the army stopped us

04:37.528 --> 04:40.895
on a back road
and directed us here.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.064
They were supposed
to come later.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.404
They didn't.

04:47.872 --> 04:51.660
But there were supplies here

04:51.834 --> 04:53.745
and we made the best of it.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.171
You put up the wall?

04:56.338 --> 04:59.205
Well, there was
this huge shopping mall

04:59.383 --> 05:01.465
being built nearby.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.593
And my husband Reg
is a professor of architecture.

05:05.598 --> 05:10.092
And who he was
mattered quite a bit.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.510
He got the first plates up
with our sons.

05:12.688 --> 05:17.352
And after a few weeks,
more people arrived

05:17.526 --> 05:20.108
and we had help.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.985
We had a community.

05:22.156 --> 05:26.365
You've been behind these walls
this entire time?

05:27.661 --> 05:31.324
We need people who have
lived out there.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.660
Your group is the first
we've even considered

05:33.834 --> 05:36.246
taking in for a long time.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.036
You should keep
your gates closed.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.540
Why?

05:44.803 --> 05:48.011
Because it's all
about survival now.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.138
At any cost.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.302
People out there are always
looking for an angle.

05:55.481 --> 05:58.018
Looking to play
on your weakness.

05:59.652 --> 06:01.893
They measure you

06:02.071 --> 06:05.484
by what they can take from you.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.525
By how they can
use you to live.

06:09.703 --> 06:14.242
So bringing people into
a place like this now--

06:14.416 --> 06:17.783
Are you telling me
not to bring your people in?

06:17.962 --> 06:21.454
Are you already
looking after this place?

06:24.593 --> 06:26.504
Aaron says I can trust you.

06:26.679 --> 06:28.670
Aaron doesn't know me.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.054
l've killed people.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.221
I don't even know
how many by now.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.517
But I know why they're all dead.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.433
They're dead so my family,

06:42.611 --> 06:46.195
all those people
out there, can be alive.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.856
So I could be alive for them.

06:50.286 --> 06:53.494
Sounds like I'd want
to be part of your family.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.781
Rick,

06:59.628 --> 07:02.335
northern Virginia was
effectively evacuated.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.794
Millions of people gone.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.583
For a long time,
there's hardly been anyone here,

07:07.761 --> 07:10.468
living or dead, but still...

07:12.433 --> 07:14.515
we have lost people.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.100
And...

07:18.897 --> 07:20.808
I've done things.

07:23.027 --> 07:25.109
What have you done?

07:27.072 --> 07:30.530
l exiled three men
who didn't work out.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.283
And we both know that's
as good as killing them.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.707
What do you want from us?

07:41.462 --> 07:43.669
These families...

07:47.176 --> 07:49.258
these families
should be able to raise their children

07:49.428 --> 07:50.838
in a safe environment.

07:51.013 --> 07:54.722
Your son, your daughter,

07:54.892 --> 07:58.259
should have a place
to grow up.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.223
What do I want?

08:02.024 --> 08:05.232
I want you to help us survive.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.644
I know you can
help us do that.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.280
How?

08:13.452 --> 08:17.536
I am exceptionally good
at reading people.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.368
If I didn't win reelection,

08:20.542 --> 08:22.749
l was gonna be
a professional poker player.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.205
( scoffs )

08:24.380 --> 08:26.712
I'm not kidding.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.547
Rick...

08:31.053 --> 08:33.544
it's 3:37 PM.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.047
You're skeptical.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.345
You have a right to be.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.936
But it's time to decide

08:46.110 --> 08:48.442
if you're the one
who's doing the deciding.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.749
l was a sheriff.

09:07.423 --> 09:11.541
Yeah, I knew it was
something like that.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.598
Deanna:
They're still your guns.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.636
You can check them out whenever
you go beyond the wall.

09:23.814 --> 09:27.227
But inside here,
we store them for safety.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.125
Should have brought
another bin.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.719
- Both of 'em?
- At your disposal.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.138
I'd call dibs on that one.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.274
It's got more curb appeal.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.858
Listen, I know you're
still feeling us out,

10:15.032 --> 10:17.193
but I'm glad you came.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.859
Anyway, Deanna's asked everyone
to give you your space

10:21.038 --> 10:23.825
so they aren't all
coming at you at once.

10:23.999 --> 10:27.366
Take your time.
Explore.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.830
You need anything,
you call me.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.706
ldon't-- we don't have phones.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.842
|-- I meant...
l'm four houses down.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.469
- Thank you.
- So...

11:54.882 --> 11:57.874
(water running)

12:14.276 --> 12:16.517
( knocking )

12:26.622 --> 12:28.908
Hey.
I work in the pantry.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.915
Deanna asked me to bring these over
for you and your friends.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.961
Thank you.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.467
We'rejust cleaning up.

12:39.635 --> 12:40.875
I can see that.

12:41.053 --> 12:44.466
You still have
some shaving cream on your chin.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.140
l'm Jessie.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.098
( sighs )
Rick.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.981
You know,
I used to be a stylist.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.312
And 12 other things.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.773
I could give you
a cut if you want.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.111
You don't even know me.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.826
I can take care of myself.

13:10.582 --> 13:14.325
l have two boys,
Ron and Sam.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.500
Ron's my oldest boy.
He's about your son's age.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.006
I could introduce them.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.009
- If that's okay with you and--
- It's just me.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.221
No, that'd be-- that'd be great.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.513
I'm sorry.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.566
Electricity, showers,

13:39.736 --> 13:41.852
haircuts--

13:43.532 --> 13:45.523
I never thought
I'd see those again.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.325
Come on.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.237
Haircuts were never
going away.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.746
It's okay if you're
not okay with this yet.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.296
That's better.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.054
Deanna:
You're welcome to sit, Daryl.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.097
I won't bite.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.812
Yeah, I'm all right.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.688
Daryl, do you want to be here?

14:28.410 --> 14:31.117
The boy and the baby,

14:31.288 --> 14:33.745
they deserve a roof.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.412
I guess.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.845
You can look.
Just be quick.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.721
Okay.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.277
These are like mansions.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.869
Mm-hmm. And they're
just giving them away.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.953
You coming?

15:23.131 --> 15:25.372
Yeah, in a sec.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.352
They're right next
to each other, but--

15:42.526 --> 15:45.108
They took our weapons
and now they're splitting us up.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.314
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.402
We'll all be staying
in the same house tonight.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.778
(thumping, wood creaking)

16:13.348 --> 16:15.430
(thumping)

17:20.707 --> 17:21.992
(Michonne sighs)

17:22.167 --> 17:24.158
How long was I in there for?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.001
Rick:
20 minutes.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.584
God, I could not stop brushing.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.468
Huh.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.095
I've never--

17:37.265 --> 17:39.005
I've never seen
your face like that.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.347
That's what I felt
before and after.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.770
Look...

17:45.941 --> 17:48.774
| get why we're playing it safe.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.525
We should.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.145
| just--

17:55.200 --> 17:57.441
l have a good feeling
about this place.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.736
Well, I hope you're right.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.327
Yeah, me, too.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.617
( knocking )

18:08.672 --> 18:10.708
Rick, |--

18:11.841 --> 18:14.127
- Wow.
- ( groans )

18:14.302 --> 18:17.135
I didn't know
what was under there.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.967
Listen, I don't
mean to interrupt.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.803
| just wanted to stop by
and see how you were all settling.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.354
Oh, my.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.849
Staying together.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.358
Smart.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.315
Rick:
No one said we couldn't.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.481
You said you're a family.
That's what you said.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.694
Absolutely amazing
to me how people

18:41.871 --> 18:43.657
with completely
different backgrounds

18:43.832 --> 18:46.619
and nothing in common
can become that.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.658
Don't you think?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.540
Everybody said
you gave them jobs.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.580
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.044
Part of this place.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.801
Looks like the communists
won after all.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.588
Well, you didn't give me one.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.631
l have.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.018
ljust haven't told you yet.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.394
Same with Michonne.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.808
I'm closing in on
something for Sasha.

19:12.986 --> 19:17.821
And I'm just trying
to figure Mr. Dixon out, but I will.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.532
You look good.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.796
If this is how
you're saying it is...

20:23.431 --> 20:25.422
then this is what we wanted.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.592
We're ready for this.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.561
Deanna:
All of you?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.768
(sighs)

20:36.152 --> 20:37.437
All of us.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.281
Rick:
They said explore.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.237
Let's explore.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.323
Nah, I'll stay.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.330
All right.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.757
Lori and me,

21:00.927 --> 21:04.010
we used to drive through
neighborhoods like this.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.592
Thinking, "One day..."

21:08.810 --> 21:11.472
Well, here we are.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.024
We'll be back.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.311
- Come on. Come on.
- ( laughing)

21:45.346 --> 21:47.632
( clatters )

21:47.807 --> 21:49.138
Rick, you okay?

21:49.309 --> 21:50.640
Did Carl
and Judith walk by?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.187
We were out and they
were ahead of me.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.606
It's okay. I think I know
where they are.

21:58.735 --> 22:01.067
That's Natalie and Bob Miller.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.979
They had five kids
and 12 grandkids.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.486
It's been a long time
since anyone around here

22:07.660 --> 22:09.742
has seen a baby.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.869
She's gonna have to put up
with some pinched cheeks.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.452
Thanks.
ljust, um--

22:14.626 --> 22:17.038
It's okay.
I get it.

22:21.508 --> 22:26.548
Look, I'm sorry I broke
whatever that was I broke.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.383
It's a sculpture
I'm making with the boys.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.717
It's an owl.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.883
I mean, it will be.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.052
| just can't get the eyes right.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.266
Right, the eyes.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.941
You didn't even get
a good look at it.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.360
(sighs)

22:41.528 --> 22:43.735
l was in the middle
of losing my mind.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.408
Hey, Rick.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.115
Would it be okay
if Carl came over now?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.200
Ron really wants
to meet him.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.502
Ron: We're almost always
here after school,

23:02.674 --> 23:03.959
so you can come by any time.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.919
You go to school?

23:06.094 --> 23:08.085
It's in a garage.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.255
Little kids go in the morning
and then it's us in the afternoon.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.842
Probably you, too, right?

23:13.017 --> 23:15.099
Probably.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.182
Guys, this is Carl.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.348
Carl, this is Mikey and Enid.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.608
Hey.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.234
Hi.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.145
Enid's from outside, too.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.700
Shejust came
eight months ago.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.817
Oh, um...

23:32.996 --> 23:35.157
is this yours?

23:35.331 --> 23:36.992
Sorry.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.373
We didn't know you guys
got that house.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.081
We mostly just hang out there
and listen to music.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.495
That's Enid's.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.885
Wanna play
some video games?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.046
Or Mikey's house
has a pool table,

23:53.224 --> 23:55.966
but his dad's
kind of strict about it, so...

23:56.144 --> 23:58.385
It's okay.
He's at work.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.435
Um...

24:07.614 --> 24:10.822
Sorry, I guess we
come on kind of strong.

24:10.992 --> 24:13.233
We can just hang out.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.527
Mikey: You don't even have to talk
if you don't wanna.

24:15.705 --> 24:19.448
Ron: Yeah, took Enid three
weeks to say something.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.751
Pull it together, sport.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.665
Let's, um--

24:28.843 --> 24:30.504
let's play some video games.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.928
Ron:
Cool, yeah.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.135
This is the kind of place
my mom wanted for us.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.469
Deanna:
I'm sorry you lost her.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.689
l didn'tjust lose her.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.025
I killed her.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.067
It had to be me.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.368
Hey.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.785
How was Ron's house?

24:57.955 --> 25:01.118
What do you think of this place?

25:02.752 --> 25:05.243
Well, I think it seems...

25:07.215 --> 25:08.546
nice.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.331
Yeah.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.546
I like it here.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.755
I like the people.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.717
But they're weak.

25:16.891 --> 25:20.008
And I don't want us
to get weak, too.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.469
Hmm.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.164
Deanna hasn't
given me a job yet.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.128
You want one?

25:54.971 --> 25:56.802
Yeah.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.547
Do you?

25:59.726 --> 26:02.138
That's signing the papers.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.803
That's saying yes,
this is how it is.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.438
You afraid to do that?

26:07.608 --> 26:09.860
Are you?

26:10.027 --> 26:12.154
No.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.986
So then why
are we both awake?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.451
I'm gonna take a walk.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.593
Man:
You're Rick.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.224
Yeah.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.818
My wife cut your hair.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.648
Yeah.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.159
Welcome to Alexandria.

27:27.522 --> 27:31.856
I did laundry,
gardened, um...

27:32.026 --> 27:34.358
always had dinner
on the table for Ed

27:34.529 --> 27:36.019
when he came home.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.563
Um...

27:38.741 --> 27:42.984
I miss that stupid,
wonderful man every day.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.405
You know, I really didn't have much
to offer this group,

27:47.583 --> 27:49.869
so I think | just sort of
became their den mother.

27:50.044 --> 27:52.581
And they've been
nice enough to protect me.

27:54.382 --> 27:56.964
Deanna: Where do you think
you'll fit in?

27:57.134 --> 27:59.921
Oh, um, hmm.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.720
Well, I'd like to be involved
in the community.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.722
Do you have anything
like a Junior League?

28:05.893 --> 28:08.054
I'm a real people person.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.729
Ow.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.935
( door opens)

28:17.238 --> 28:19.729
Time to punch the clock
and make the casseroles.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.238
What?

28:21.409 --> 28:23.115
Make dinner
for the older people--

28:23.286 --> 28:26.403
moms who need a break,
people who can't cook.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.663
Get to meet a lot
of the neighbors that way.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.040
( scoffs )
All right.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.825
Have you taken a shower yet?

28:33.004 --> 28:34.960
Mm-hmm.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.122
Take a shower.
I'm gonna wash that vest.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.461
We need to keep up
appearances, even you.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.250
Hey, I ain't starting now.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.385
I'm gonna hose you
down in your sleep.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.469
You look ridiculous.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.804
We need to make this work.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.179
Deanna:
Why?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.107
'Cause...

28:58.738 --> 29:00.899
we were almost
out there too long.

30:23.197 --> 30:26.689
Glenn, Tara, Noah?

30:27.743 --> 30:29.074
Nice to meet you.
I'm Aiden.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.860
You met Nicholas
pulling gate duty.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.539
- Nicholas: Hey.
- You're Deanna's son?

30:32.707 --> 30:35.870
That's right. I hear you got experience
making supply runs.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.829
I saw your pantry.

30:38.004 --> 30:38.993
You guys seem to do pretty well.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.584
Yeah, well, had some training
before this. ROTC.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.249
Was nearing lieutenant
when this shit blew in.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.636
- My dad did ROTC.
- He didn't make it?

30:50.099 --> 30:51.680
Nah.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.805
I'm sorry.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.478
I'm sorry a lot these days.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.685
Come on,
I'll show you the ropes.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.771
We're doing a run today?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.736
Just a dry run.

31:05.906 --> 31:09.194
Show you the terrain outside
the walls, see how you do.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.575
Weigh each other's sack
a little, you know?

31:11.746 --> 31:15.204
No, I don't, but cool.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.365
- What about weapons?
- Oh, yeah.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.161
We pulled out some sweet-ass
biscuits for today.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.203
( distant metal clanging )

32:22.775 --> 32:25.391
- ( metal clanging )
- ( snarling )

32:44.588 --> 32:46.840
(snarling )

33:13.951 --> 33:16.533
(walkers snarling )

33:53.657 --> 33:55.522
Get ready.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.215
Dad.

34:36.492 --> 34:39.734
Aiden: We've been increasing
our radius mile by mile,

34:39.912 --> 34:42.949
spreading in a semicircle
around the town.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.786
Nicholas: We've made it
53 miles out so far.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.953
Aiden: We break into two groups
when we step outside our vehicle.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.257
lf shit hits, we fire a flare.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.585
One group gets the other.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.466
Noah:
Good system.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.878
It is.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.672
Still, you're standing here
because we lost four people last month.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.841
What happened?

35:04.019 --> 35:07.511
Aiden: We were on a run,
roamers came out,

35:07.690 --> 35:08.850
they didn't follow the system.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.561
They were good people.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.896
They were.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.562
They were just scared.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.737
Look, I can be a hard-ass.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.573
And I know I'm a douchebag.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.829
Someone's got to call
the ball around here

35:26.000 --> 35:28.366
and that someone is me.

35:28.544 --> 35:31.752
If you're on this crew,
you do exactly as I say.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.462
Sorry you lost your people.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.875
Yeah.
We got ours.

35:39.555 --> 35:42.171
Managed to snag one of the deadheads
that took them down.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.010
Strung it up there.

35:44.184 --> 35:47.142
What? Why?

35:47.313 --> 35:49.429
Now we have a little pregame ritual.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.733
Get our heads on straight.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.936
Remind us what we're up against.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.193
(flies buzzing )

35:56.363 --> 35:58.649
Son of a bitch!

35:58.824 --> 36:00.280
Help me find it.

36:00.451 --> 36:02.533
Look at this shit.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.319
Blood's still wet.
It's nearby.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.704
- ( whistles)
- Shh!

36:07.875 --> 36:10.708
Hey-- hey, hey.
It's gone.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.334
It took down
one of our friends.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.165
It's nearby,
we're not letting it go.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.001
( whistles )

36:16.175 --> 36:18.416
- ( clapping ) Hey!
- ( snarling )

36:18.594 --> 36:21.085
Hey, over here.
Come on. Come on.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.720
Hey, come on.
Come at me.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.847
- No, don't touch it.
- The rest of you, back off.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.383
Come on. Come on.
Come here.

36:27.561 --> 36:30.894
Come on. Come on.
Come on now. Come on!

36:33.067 --> 36:34.648
Get him.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.900
Damn it!

36:43.786 --> 36:45.617
Aiden:
No, hold on to it!

36:52.419 --> 36:54.626
- What the hell?!
- Yeah, what the hell?

36:54.797 --> 36:57.254
- You almost got her killed!
- I told you all to stay back!

36:57.424 --> 37:00.211
I told you to listen
to every damn thing I said.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.047
I told you that.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.730
You three need new gigs.

37:17.444 --> 37:18.729
You're not ready for runs yet.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.862
Yeah, pretty sure
you got that backwards.

37:22.032 --> 37:24.444
Hey. Hey.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.951
Look, we got a way
of doing things around here.

37:28.122 --> 37:31.114
- You tied up walkers.
- It killed our friend.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.078
Look, I'm not having
this conversation.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.834
You obey my orders out there.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.131
Then we're just as screwed
as your last run crew.

37:43.637 --> 37:44.968
Say that again.

37:45.139 --> 37:46.800
Tara:
No, back off, Aiden.

37:46.974 --> 37:49.340
- Come on.
- Come on, man. Just take a step back.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.554
Come on, tough guy.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.639
No one's impressed, man.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.179
Walk away.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.643
Deanna: Aiden!
What is going on?

37:57.818 --> 38:00.230
This guy's got a problem
with the way we do things.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.154
Why did you let these people in?

38:05.325 --> 38:07.452
Because we actually know
what we're doing out there.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.361
Aiden, no!
That's enough!

38:11.498 --> 38:14.035
Deanna:
I said that is enough!

38:14.209 --> 38:15.710
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

38:15.878 --> 38:17.914
- Let's not do this now.
- Tell him.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.329
You want to end up
on your ass again?

38:20.507 --> 38:22.498
- Aiden: Cool, all right?
- Rick: Daryl.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.964
(coughing)

38:32.352 --> 38:34.217
I want everyone
to hear me, okay?

38:34.396 --> 38:37.388
Rick and his people are part
of this community now

38:37.566 --> 38:40.683
in all ways as equals.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.814
Understood?

38:49.369 --> 38:51.200
Understood.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.874
All of you,
turn in your weapons.

38:57.044 --> 38:59.160
Then you two come talk to me.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.550
I told you I had ajob for you.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.841
I'd like you to be our constable.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.053
That's what you were.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.315
That's what you are.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.658
And you, too.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.366
Will you accept?

39:38.460 --> 39:40.451
Okay.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.754
Yeah, I'm in.

39:43.924 --> 39:45.915
( scoffs )

39:51.306 --> 39:52.762
Thank you.

39:53.934 --> 39:54.969
For what?

39:55.143 --> 39:57.930
For knocking him on his ass.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.110
You don't like me, do you?

40:21.044 --> 40:23.035
Rick: You should keep
your gates closed.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.295
Deanna: Why?

40:27.426 --> 40:30.918
Because it's all about
survival now.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.428
At any cost.

40:35.726 --> 40:39.469
People out there are always
looking for an angle.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.978
Looking to play
on your weakness.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.975
They measure you

40:46.153 --> 40:49.441
by what they can take from you,

40:49.615 --> 40:52.277
by how they can use you to live.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.913
We good?

41:08.091 --> 41:09.706
Yeah.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.216
You a cop again?

41:11.386 --> 41:13.968
(sighs)

41:14.139 --> 41:16.175
I'm trying it on for size.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.306
So we're staying?

41:23.857 --> 41:27.190
I think we can start
sleeping in our own homes.

41:27.361 --> 41:30.068
Settle in.

41:30.238 --> 41:33.275
If we get comfortable here,
we let our guard down--

41:33.450 --> 41:36.817
this place is gonna
make us weak.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.486
Carl said that.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.405
But it's not gonna happen.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.213
We won't get weak.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.835
That's not in us anymore.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.052
We'll make it work.

42:03.313 --> 42:05.178
And if they can't make it...

42:08.026 --> 42:10.267
then we'll just take this place.

42:21.581 --> 42:24.573
