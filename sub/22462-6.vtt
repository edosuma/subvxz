You don't have one that just says,
"You are 40 years old"?

Um... we have, "Life begins at 40,"
or, "40 today."

No. I want one that reads...

00:30.520 --> 00:34.150
..."Jeremy, you are 40 years old."

00:34.200 --> 00:35.349
Do you need "old"?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.631
I think it rounds it off nicely.

<i>I'm gonna make Jeremy
turn 40 whether he likes it or not.</i>

- A fax machine?

I know. Wilfully perverse, but I'm trying
to get in touch with someone

00:45.440 --> 00:48.512
who, for whatever reason,
won't return my calls.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.030

Celebration for the birthday boy?

No, mate.

Cos I definitely don't want a party.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.873
Well, I'm definitely not planning one,

01:36.720 --> 01:39.553
Good, because I told Joe
I'll be 39 tomorrow.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.477
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.276
40 is basically 50, and 50 is dead,
whereas 39 is like 35.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.596
35 is practically 30, 30 is 20. You know?

Not entirely.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.234
He's 30 next year.

For a few months, theoretically,
we can be in our 30's together.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.990
29, 39, OK.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.618
31, 42, no. 16, 26, better.

02:02.643 --> 02:04.586
You're just saying numbers now, Jeremy.

02:04.611 --> 02:07.153

Oh, a sprout sandwich!
Are you on a health kick?

02:13.640 --> 02:15.790
- I need the vitamins.
- Why?

02:15.840 --> 02:18.958
I've gotta try and keep up with Joe.
He's so fucking full of life.

<i>Is</i> this his? <i>The Golden Fountain?</i>

02:22.120 --> 02:24.191
No, it's mine.
It's about the beneficial properties

02:24.240 --> 02:27.312

the human vitamin drink.

Why do the Uchamojo people live to 100,
Mark?

02:35.720 --> 02:38.314
I don't know, Jeremy,
because you just made them up?

02:38.360 --> 02:41.796
Because they take the original vaccine,
the watery battery, the mellow yellow.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.269

Not the chocolate factory.
That's horrible.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.431
Ah, sorry, mate.
You're getting shit-canned, Mark.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.075
You're getting fucked by a flagpole
in your tiny little vagina.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.315
- Jeff?!
- Yeah, I had

04:00.360 --> 04:02.192

- What? But...

04:03.920 --> 04:06.514

- I'm sorry, Mark. You're contaminated.

<i>No, Alan.
Remember all the good times, Alan.</i>

04:13.200 --> 04:16.192
ALAN: So, Mr Corrigan, it has been brought
to our attention that you certified

04:16.240 --> 04:18.277
a loan to a friend of yourself,

04:18.320 --> 04:21.676
ticking the certification boxes
without adequate document checks.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.472
This is gross negligence and

- we're dismissing you forthwith.
- I'm sorry,

04:25.560 --> 04:29.918

- Um, to a Mr Usborne, Jeremy.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.429
- It's come to light due to a complaint.
- What complaint?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.073
- Who complained?
- Well, Mr Usborne

04:34.120 --> 04:35.190
has been in contact to say

04:35.240 --> 04:37.595
that he believes
that the granting of this loan to him

04:37.640 --> 04:40.996
was, um, "out of proportion
with the just working of the universe".

04:41.040 --> 04:43.680
He does not wish
to be responsible for another Greece

04:43.720 --> 04:46.792
and he's claiming mental incapacity
due to the influence of the internet

04:46.840 --> 04:49.798
reducing his attention span
against his own will.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.717
But I can get the money back.
I know him.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.515
I can get it back. I'll jam a Biro

09:40.840 --> 09:43.992
they sit around in the Cabinet,
talking about sending Philip Hammond

09:44.040 --> 09:47.749
over to fuck Hollande
to sort out the euro?

09:47.800 --> 09:50.189
Oi, Godley & Creme, they're on the move.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.470
JEZ: Ooh!
Body language doesn't look great.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.352
It does look a little testy.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.959
HANS: Yes...
JEZ: He's off.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.198
Closing time in the last chance saloon,
Mark, time to grab your nuts and splurge.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.272
- Oh, fuck! I'm gonna do something.
- Be the canary.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.880
- Full fucking Delia.
- I don't know what you mean.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.955
You go, girl.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.752
This still doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.952
HANS: Ahh! He's so fucked.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.354
MARK: April!

10:14.400 --> 10:17.518
Mark? What are you doing here?

10:17.560 --> 10:19.119
I-I just bumped into you.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.276
Well, no, you just ran round
the corner after me.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.789
No, right, I mean, I just...

10:23.840 --> 10:27.470
Look, could we grab a coffee
for five minutes?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.318
I've got a couple of things I need to say.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.111
<i>Got the coffee, disregard the price,
the price of the coffee is irrelevant.</i>

10:36.160 --> 10:37.753
- Thanks, Mark.
- No biggie.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.473
I mean, God knows how
they can charge so much.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.238
They're certainly not spending it
on lampshades.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.590
<i>Hello, Dad, you're living
inside me now, are you?</i>

10:43.640 --> 10:45.119
Yeah, so the flight's at midnight.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.393
To Athens. Um, the ferry leaves tomorrow,
all the islands except Corfu.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.590
Oh, not Corfu, why not Corfu?

10:51.640 --> 10:53.278
<i>He asked innocently.</i>

10:53.320 --> 10:55.118
Cos that's where Angus had his affair.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.118
Oh, of course, sorry, I'd forgotten.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.629
Sorry to drag all that up again,
all the resentment.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.194
- Sorry. Idiot!
- It's fine.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.198
Anyway, what I wanted to say,
just before you go,

11:06.240 --> 11:10.438
and if you want me to stop,
just say, but...

11:10.480 --> 11:12.039
Yeah, I...

11:12.080 --> 11:19.111
I basically think that you're just
so funny and clever and brilliant

11:19.160 --> 11:22.232
and I really am sorry
if that makes things difficult,

11:22.280 --> 11:27.719
but I think it's only fair that you should
know that I think we'd be great together.

11:27.760 --> 11:33.950
I mean, I know I'm not perfect.
In fact, I'm not even probably average.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.675
I'm a misshapen potato, an oddball.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.199
<i>Feel free to disagree, April.</i>

11:39.240 --> 11:43.199
I'm mean-spirited and I only really
like hearing about other people's holidays

11:43.240 --> 11:46.392
when they've been disastrous, but I...

11:47.600 --> 11:49.591
...I really, really like you.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.075
In fact, in all honesty, I...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.797
I love you.

11:56.840 --> 12:01.391
Look, it was really weird the last time
we saw each other -

12:01.440 --> 12:04.432
you burying your wife in a pit of balls.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.395
Ex-wife, and more hiding than burying,
but point taken.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.034
The truth is I... I do have feelings...

12:12.080 --> 12:13.275
<i>Feelings!</i>

12:13.320 --> 12:15.072
...and it's not all been easy with Angus.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.590
Just had a mini row because he didn't want
to spend an extra £300

12:18.640 --> 12:19.960
on a cabin with a porthole.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.230
If you're gonna be on a boat
for three months, you want a porthole.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.157
- Course you do. Huh! Who wouldn't?

12:24.200 --> 12:29.400
<i>300 quid pissed straight out the porthoie.
Correct call, Angus.</i>

12:29.440 --> 12:30.953
Wow!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.071
OK, wow.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.078
- What?
- It's Angus, he's been having a think,

12:36.120 --> 12:38.316
and he's not sure
we should go on this cruise.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.431
Oh. Oh, right.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.472
<i>Furrow the brow, furrow the brow
to hide the smile.</i>

12:43.520 --> 12:46.160
Apparently,
now he wants to go to Ibiza...

12:46.200 --> 12:47.190
alone.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.277
<i>- Alone?

<i>I've conquered the Whole of Russia.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.400
- Mark, how's it going, you lovely rotter?
- Everything's coming up roses.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.398
April and I just had an overpriced coffee
and did it in the toilets.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.477
- Excellent.
- April loves doing it in toilets.

13:11.520 --> 13:15.309
In fact, 100% of the times
we've done it, we've done it in toilets.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.556
- I can't wait to do it in a bed.
- It'll be amazing.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.833
But the big news is that Angus texted
to say that he's fucked off to Ibiza,

13:21.880 --> 13:26.795
of all places, leaving the coast clear for
me to go off with his wife on the cruise.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.194
Me and April, April and me!

13:28.240 --> 13:32.757
Man, that is so great. I am really happy
for you. You deserve that.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.870
Look, I just wanted to say,

13:33.920 --> 13:36.434
I-I know things have been
a bit difficult between us

13:36.480 --> 13:39.598
over the last day or so,
what with the punching and the blanking,

13:39.640 --> 13:41.711
but you're a good friend,

13:41.760 --> 13:45.355
although I still haven't
totally forgiven you... mate.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.994
I wouldn't have expected you to... mate.

- MAN: Help!
- HANS: Shut it.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.480
- What the fuck have you done?
- I know it's my birthday, not yours,

14:00.520 --> 14:04.070
but I got you a lovely present to say
sorry for making you lose your job

14:04.120 --> 14:05.679
and never paying you any rent

14:05.720 --> 14:08.519
and for falling in love with Dobby,
for everything.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.473
It's fine, I wanted to come.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.352
Could I possibly get a glass of water?

14:19.840 --> 14:23.674
They said they were gonna chop my
penis off and put it into another orifice.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.597
Oh, Angus, shush!

14:25.640 --> 14:27.756
- Bahts, mad bahts.
- They said they had

14:27.800 --> 14:28.835
a sock with a rock in it.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.235
They made me drink urine, Mark.
Human urine.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.715
He greedily gulped from a bedside bottle

14:33.760 --> 14:35.637
that happened to be
from the golden source.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.956
Let me go, Mark.
Will you let me go? Please!

14:38.000 --> 14:41.038
Angus, you... you must know
I had nothing to do with this.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.869
There you go, you naughty monkey.
Drink it nicely this time.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.354
Not gulpy.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.309
Did you send the text?

14:49.360 --> 14:53.035
Yes. I was worried Ibiza was too much.
Was it too much?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.354
What the fuck have you done, Jeremy?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.515
I've done a good one.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.233
I've cleared the coast,
the coast is clear.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.317
The coast is not clear.
We're all going to prison.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.478
You've gone totally loopy.
You kidnapped Angus.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.911
Or did I invite an unstable oddball
for a lift in Harm's van

15:05.960 --> 15:07.633
then back to here for a Shifter,

15:07.680 --> 15:10.354
then he accidentally got locked in my room
for a few hours?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.993
It's our word against his.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.269
This is bad.

This is really bad.

This is brilliant and it totally worked.
You're back with April.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.199
Yes, until she finds out.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.517
- I mean, what's the long-term plan?
- The long-term plan is sucky-fucky.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.597
Sucky-fucky is not a long-term plan.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.109
Look, how longs the cruise for? Months.

Hmm.

- Exactly.

- No, Mark.

Yeah, 38, 39,

18:51.520 --> 18:53.636

18:53.680 --> 18:56.832

19:01.400 --> 19:05.792
It is, Joe. Look, I can't rave all day
and fuck all night,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.593
and, honestly, I don't even like
drinking my own piss.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.711
- You drink your own piss?
- Yes, I eat cashews

19:10.760 --> 19:13.229
and I drink my own piss
and it doesn't work.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.114
I'm never gonna be young, dumb and
full of cum ever again and that's that.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.719
Fine. I get it.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.958
I want to come with you,
but I'm just scared I might die.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.913
Maybe I'll ask Megan
if she wants to come instead.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.395
Joe... Don't go, Joe.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.080
<i>Oh, I've driven him away
with my horrible oldness.</i>

19:31.120 --> 19:35.273
Yeah, Megan, <i>you're 29</i> now,
<i>but one day you'll be, like, 56.</i>

19:35.320 --> 19:38.631
- APRIL: Speech!
- ALL: Speech!

19:38.680 --> 19:41.194
- Come on, Mark, you start.
- Yeah.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.312
<i>Here</i> goes. <i>Quick speech and then cruise.</i>
Jeremy.

19:44.360 --> 19:48.991
What can I say?
A man I know very well indeed.

19:49.040 --> 19:53.591
<i>That's probably as far as I can truthfully
go on the endearment stakes. Um...</i>

19:53.640 --> 19:58.077
He's... he's not a great man,
he's not a wise man,

19:58.120 --> 20:00.714
he's not always a good man.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.469
OK, <i>Where</i> am <i>I going?</i> But he is a...

20:04.520 --> 20:05.999
a nice man...

20:07.120 --> 20:08.554
...up to a point...

20:09.440 --> 20:12.034
...and I...

20:12.080 --> 20:13.673
like him.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.075
<i>- There, I've said</i> it, <i>hope</i> he's <i>happy.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.515
APRIL: Speech, Jez.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.959
- Speech!
- Speech!

20:20.000 --> 20:24.836
Um, thanks, Mark.
We're, er, quite a gang, obviously,

20:24.880 --> 20:27.713
us two - brains and the funny one,

20:27.760 --> 20:32.994
the old, stick-up-his-arse,
boring-jumper one and the

20:33.040 --> 20:36.999
sexy, pep-up-the-party,
acid-in-the-punchbowl one.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.997
<i>He loves triggering mental illness.</i>

20:39.040 --> 20:43.557
But we get on pretty well and we have
our ups and downs, like any couple.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.480
<i>Hold on. If Hans is here,
Who's with the hostage?</i>

20:47.520 --> 20:50.797
<i>Oh, God, We got an unattended hostage.</i>

20:50.840 --> 20:55.152
...And, er, a boring bastard sometimes,
but at the end of the day,

20:55.200 --> 20:59.080
we've lived together for shit long
and it's been...

20:59.120 --> 21:00.110
all right.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.231
<i>- (APPLAUSE)
- Oh, fuck!</i>

21:02.280 --> 21:05.511
<i>Got to keep the attention.</i>

21:05.560 --> 21:13.479
Er, yeah, and if I could just say
one more thing, um, Jeremy, Jez, er,

21:13.520 --> 21:18.356
please always...keep on...being you.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.471
<i>Totally meaningless.
I'm gonna get rumbled.</i>

21:20.520 --> 21:24.150
<i>That is sweet. That might be
the nicest thing he's ever said.</i>

21:24.200 --> 21:27.830
- Oi, April!
- Angus?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.679
<i>Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!</i>

21:32.120 --> 21:33.315
Mark?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.955
- Help, don't let them kill me.
- Oh, Angus, don't be a big silly.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.638
We were just hanging out.
It's all fine.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.990
He said he was going to out my willy off
and put it into my bottom.

21:41.040 --> 21:45.034
Jokey, I said it jokey, Angus,
you've got to admit that, right?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.515
- Simon?
- What's going on, Mark?

21:47.560 --> 21:51.599
This has nothing to do
with Mark or Hans. It's all my doing.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.755
It's all your doing?

21:52.800 --> 21:57.715
Angus wanted stuff done to him, I wasn't
into it, it's all pretty disgusting,

21:57.760 --> 22:01.276
I don't wanna go into details,
but it's complicated.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.880
We'll probably never fully understand,
like Stonehenge.

22:03.920 --> 22:08.756
Mark knew. Mark saw it all.
They got me outside the travel agency.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.310
Molly. For fuck's sake!

22:12.360 --> 22:15.591
<i>Who could have possibly predicted
that falsely imprisoning a love rival</i>

22:15.640 --> 22:18.837
<i>would turn out so badly? Only a genius.</i>

22:18.880 --> 22:20.234
April, don't go.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.796
<i>A real night to remember,
like the Titanic.</i>

22:25.360 --> 22:28.512
Right, well, it's over with Molly.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.949
Apparently I'm not even allowed to do
a little fucking naughty kidnap,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.674
so bollocks to it.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.509
I'm going to van it to Macedonia,
finally set up the moped rental.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.198
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.038
Laters.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.718
See you.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.873
Are we gonna be all right?

22:47.920 --> 22:52.312
<i>The project to reintroduce wolves into
this habitat has been controversial...</i>

22:52.360 --> 22:55.478
That's the last thing I need.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.477
Now they're bringing back wolves.

22:57.520 --> 23:01.832
- Oh, God, I am so tired.
- What next?

23:01.880 --> 23:06.636
Bring back smallpox? We all had fun
with the smallpox, didn't we?

23:06.680 --> 23:10.310
- Is it time smallpox had a reboot?
- Mark?

23:10.360 --> 23:14.149
- Will you pull me off?
- I'm not about to pull you off, Jeremy.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.750
And if you think about it,
I'm sure you don't really want me to.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.279
Sure. Whatever.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.197
I just thought it might be comforting.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.551
What about I read to you
from Napoleon's correspondence?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.111
If I was going to kill you,

23:28.160 --> 23:30.231
- I'd have a great sign-off.
- Yeah?

23:30.280 --> 23:35.070
You always loved history, Mark,
well, now you can be part of it.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.394
Bang!

23:36.440 --> 23:40.320
Yeah, not bad, not bad at all.

23:40.360 --> 23:44.672
I think I'd just come at you
in the night, pillow on the face, cark!

23:44.720 --> 23:45.869
Yeah, that's you all over.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.030
<i>Aw, we do love each other really.</i>

23:49.080 --> 23:51.276
<i>5 simply must get rid of him.</i>
