WEBVTT

00:06.669 --> 00:09.070
Having a little trouble
catching your breath there?

00:10.702 --> 00:13.202
No, no, I'm good.

00:13.203 --> 00:15.036
If my P.E. teachers had told me
this is what I was training for,

00:15.229 --> 00:16.729
I would have tried
a lot harder.

00:18.596 --> 00:22.830
"Do or do not.
There is no try."

00:25.098 --> 00:27.597
<i>Did you just quote Star Wars?</i>

00:27.598 --> 00:32.665
<i>I believe I quoted
Empire Strikes Back.</i>

00:34.866 --> 00:37.032
Oh, my God.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.266
I'm lying in bed
with a beautiful woman

00:39.267 --> 00:40.666
who can quote Yoda.

00:45.601 --> 00:49.001
I love you, Penny.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.903
Oh...

00:57.637 --> 01:00.336
Thank you.

01:02.238 --> 01:04.037
You're welcome.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.638
I just wanted
to put that out there.

01:07.639 --> 01:09.272
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I'm-I'm glad.

01:09.273 --> 01:10.539
Good.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.072
Glad is good.
Yeah.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.872
Yeah...

01:14.873 --> 01:15.872
No, no...

01:15.873 --> 01:18.506
Um...

01:18.507 --> 01:21.707
So, it's getting
pretty late.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.607
We should probably
go to sleep.
Yeah.

01:23.608 --> 01:26.308
Okay.
Yeah, probably.

01:26.309 --> 01:27.909
Okay, good night, sweetie.
Good night.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.851
Hey, Leonard, where
do you come down on giant ants?

02:08.979 --> 02:10.645
Sheldon says impossible.

02:10.645 --> 02:12.378
Howard and I say
not only possible,

02:12.379 --> 02:15.945
but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than a Batmobile.

02:17.147 --> 02:19.113
You are ignoring
the square-cube law.

02:19.114 --> 02:20.580
The giant ant would be crushed

02:20.581 --> 02:22.313
under the weight
of its own exoskeleton.

02:22.314 --> 02:23.781
And for the record,

02:23.782 --> 02:26.415
the appropriate ranking of cool
modes of transportation is:

02:26.416 --> 02:28.715
jet pack, hoverboard,
transporter, Batmobile,

02:28.716 --> 02:30.848
and then giant ant.

02:32.050 --> 02:33.449
Seriously?

02:33.450 --> 02:34.816
You have nothing better to do

02:34.817 --> 02:38.817
than sit around and discuss
the possibility of giant ants?

02:38.818 --> 02:40.316
What's with him?

02:40.317 --> 02:44.017
Perhaps he's at a sensitive
point in his monthly cycle.

02:44.919 --> 02:49.052
Are you saying
he's man-strating?

02:50.186 --> 02:52.919
Not literally.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.420
But as far back
as the 17th century,

02:55.421 --> 02:57.387
scientists observed
a 33-day fluctuation

02:57.388 --> 02:58.787
in men's hormone levels.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.554
Interesting.

03:00.555 --> 03:04.288
That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

03:05.322 --> 03:08.022
You know what I'm talking about.

03:12.624 --> 03:15.157
Okay, forget
giant ants.

03:15.158 --> 03:17.424
How about giant rabbits?

03:18.291 --> 03:20.391
Big or small,
I don't like rabbits.

03:20.392 --> 03:22.291
They always look like they're
about to say something,

03:22.292 --> 03:24.159
but they never do.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.292
Rabbits do have
a respiratory system

03:26.293 --> 03:27.993
that would support great size.

03:27.994 --> 03:30.559
And on a side note, they
are one of the few mammals

03:30.560 --> 03:33.794
whose scrotum is in front
of the penis.

03:35.628 --> 03:39.494
Maybe that's what
they want to talk about.

03:39.495 --> 03:41.828
Leonard, where do you
stand on giant rabbits

03:41.829 --> 03:43.562
and scrotal position?

03:43.563 --> 03:45.829
I honestly don't care.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.530
Really?

03:47.531 --> 03:50.030
Because every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals,

03:50.031 --> 03:51.730
you've always had
some pretty strong

03:51.731 --> 03:53.030
and controversial opinions.

03:53.031 --> 03:55.464
What do you want from me?

03:55.465 --> 03:57.431
I just don't give a rat's ass.

03:57.432 --> 04:01.732
Would that be a giant rat's ass?

04:01.733 --> 04:04.733
For the record,
giant rats are possible.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.533
Can we please talk
about something else?

04:06.534 --> 04:07.533
Maybe something vaguely related

04:07.534 --> 04:09.634
to life as we know it
on this planet?

04:09.635 --> 04:11.634
Okay, how about this
for a topic:

04:11.635 --> 04:16.267
Why is Leonard being
a giant douche?

04:16.269 --> 04:19.668
Assuming giant douches
are possible.

04:19.668 --> 04:21.202
Of course they are.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.269
Leonard's being one.

04:23.270 --> 04:26.236
Maybe he's having
a lover's spat with Penny.

04:26.237 --> 04:27.870
No, there was no spat.

04:27.871 --> 04:30.271
Oh, but something happened.

04:30.272 --> 04:31.671
I don't want to talk about it.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.638
But I sense you're going to and
I don't want to hear about it.

04:34.639 --> 04:36.338
Excuse me.

04:36.339 --> 04:38.105
What'd you do, Romeo?

04:38.106 --> 04:40.106
You pour maple syrup
all over your body

04:40.107 --> 04:43.306
and ask her if she was in
the mood for a short stack?

04:46.441 --> 04:49.908
Did you think it would be funny
to put on a pair of her panties

04:49.909 --> 04:53.141
and jump around, but it wound up
just creeping her out?

04:53.142 --> 04:55.642
What? No.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.542
I'm just asking, dude.

04:57.543 --> 05:00.042
It happens.

05:01.577 --> 05:04.010
You guys still on
for bowling tonight?

05:04.011 --> 05:05.410
Oh, yes.

05:05.411 --> 05:08.677
In fact, I've prepared some
trash talk for the occasion.

05:08.678 --> 05:10.977
You bowl like your mama.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.445
Unless, of course,
she bowls well.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.245
In which case,
you bowl nothing like her.

05:15.246 --> 05:18.612
Oh. Ouch.

05:18.613 --> 05:22.547
That is what is referred
to as a burn on you.

05:24.347 --> 05:26.614
Did you ask her
to start waxing?

05:26.615 --> 05:27.581
No.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.548
Did you start waxing?

05:29.549 --> 05:30.681
No.

05:30.682 --> 05:32.348
While making love,

05:32.349 --> 05:34.248
did you accidentally
spank your own ass

05:34.249 --> 05:36.550
and cry out, "Mommy"?

05:43.518 --> 05:45.517
I'm walking away from you now.

05:45.518 --> 05:47.884
That wasn't a no.

05:47.885 --> 05:50.719
Yeah, I think
we're getting close.

05:51.886 --> 05:55.519
Did you take a Benadryl and fall
asleep while pleasuring her?

05:55.520 --> 05:58.353
Because you can die that way.

05:58.354 --> 06:01.220
Oh, that would be
a good way to go.

06:03.089 --> 06:04.787
Hi.

06:04.788 --> 06:05.722
Oh, hey.

06:05.723 --> 06:06.855
Good, Penny.

06:06.856 --> 06:08.655
bowling tonight
at 7:00.

06:08.656 --> 06:10.656
Oh, right, bowling.

06:10.657 --> 06:12.889
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.390
No, no, it's okay.

06:14.391 --> 06:17.023
I mean, let's face it, you guys
would get creamed without me.

06:17.024 --> 06:18.390
We would indeed.

06:18.391 --> 06:19.790
In this particular case,

06:19.791 --> 06:22.658
your lack of femininity
works to our advantage.

06:24.859 --> 06:27.358
It's always nice
chatting with you, Sheldon.

06:27.359 --> 06:29.292
Sarcasm?

06:29.293 --> 06:32.193
Thinly veiled contempt.

06:32.194 --> 06:35.326
7:00.
Got it.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.793
Pacific Daylight time!
Bite me!

06:37.794 --> 06:41.561
Please reserve that butch spirit
for the lanes.

06:48.863 --> 06:51.296
I thought you were bringing
your own bowling shoes.

06:51.297 --> 06:54.764
These are my own bowling shoes.

06:54.765 --> 06:56.731
Then what's with
the disinfectant?

06:56.732 --> 06:59.098
I know where my feet have been.

07:03.499 --> 07:04.532
Hey, Penny!

07:05.100 --> 07:06.666
And you guys.

07:08.101 --> 07:11.400
Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute.

07:11.401 --> 07:13.533
I believe some of you know

07:13.534 --> 07:16.000
Wil Wheaton.

07:18.069 --> 07:19.868
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

07:19.869 --> 07:22.502
Well, well, well.

07:22.503 --> 07:24.435
If it isn't Wil Wheaton,

07:24.436 --> 07:27.069
the Green Goblin
to my Spider-Man.

07:27.070 --> 07:29.369
the Pope Paul V
to my Galileo,

07:29.370 --> 07:32.304
the Internet Explorer
to my Firefox.

07:32.305 --> 07:34.038
You're not still
carrying a grudge

07:34.039 --> 07:37.071
because I beat you at
that card tournament, are you?

07:37.072 --> 07:38.505
I'm the proud owner

07:38.506 --> 07:40.705
of WilWheatonstinks.com, .net,
and .org.

07:40.706 --> 07:42.072
What does that tell you?

07:42.073 --> 07:45.873
It tells me that I am
living rent-free right here.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.240
You ready to bowl?

07:48.241 --> 07:49.907
Oh, I'm ready.

07:49.908 --> 07:52.741
I don't know if Stuart told you
what you're up against tonight,

07:52.742 --> 07:55.274
but before you stands
the co-captain of the

07:55.275 --> 07:59.642
East Texas Christian Youth
Holy Roller Bowling League
championship team.

08:00.343 --> 08:02.976
Seven- to 12-year-old division.

08:02.977 --> 08:05.376
Also, Penny's
pretty good.

08:07.678 --> 08:10.444
Great. Then it's on.

08:12.078 --> 08:17.178
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton,
it was never off.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.912
Yes!

08:20.913 --> 08:23.246
A common spare.

08:23.247 --> 08:26.481
The Miss Congeniality
of the bowling pageant.

08:26.482 --> 08:27.681
Before you jump
on Twitter

08:27.682 --> 08:30.014
to tout your modest
accomplishment,

08:30.015 --> 08:32.482
watch how it's really done.

08:32.482 --> 08:35.715
I am the ball.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.816
My thoughts are its thoughts.

08:38.817 --> 08:41.350
Its holes are my holes.

08:50.052 --> 08:51.952

08:51.953 --> 08:53.285
Tweet that,
Tweety Bird.

08:53.286 --> 08:56.719
Hey, I just wanted
to tell you

08:56.720 --> 08:58.053
I'm a big fan.

08:58.054 --> 08:59.487
Oh, thanks.

08:59.488 --> 09:02.020
<i>I'm sure you're probably sick
of Star Trek questions,</i>

09:02.021 --> 09:04.387
but Whoopi Goldberg--
you ever hit that?

09:07.856 --> 09:10.655
Ah, beer.

09:10.656 --> 09:14.555
The magic elixir that can turn
this poor, shy Indian boy

09:14.556 --> 09:16.823
into the life of the party.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.390
Oh, yeah.

09:24.358 --> 09:26.291
Chili cheese fry?

09:26.292 --> 09:28.892
Yes. I love
chili cheese fries.

09:28.893 --> 09:30.458
Really? You love them?

09:30.459 --> 09:31.593
Yeah, why?

09:31.594 --> 09:33.693
No reason.
I'm just glad to hear

09:33.694 --> 09:37.360
you're comfortable saying
you love something.

09:37.361 --> 09:39.827
Do you really want to get
into this right now?

09:39.828 --> 09:41.494
Get into what?

09:41.495 --> 09:43.595
Why wouldn't you love
the chili cheese fries?

09:43.596 --> 09:45.728
They've been in your
life a long time.

09:45.729 --> 09:47.028
They make you happy.

09:47.029 --> 09:48.729
They deserve to know.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.662
Look, you just caught me
by surprise last night.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.296
I didn't know what to say.

09:53.297 --> 09:55.230
Okay, well, now you've had
some time to think about it.

09:55.231 --> 09:56.497
So, what do you want to say?

09:56.498 --> 09:57.830
I'm not sure.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.698
How can you not be sure?

09:59.699 --> 10:01.664
Okay, this isn't the place
to have this conversation.

10:01.665 --> 10:03.998
No, the place to have
the conversation was in bed

10:03.999 --> 10:05.632
after I said, "I love yo""

10:05.633 --> 10:07.532
and you said, "Thank you.
Good night""

10:07.533 --> 10:09.699
Don't push it, Leonard.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.600
I am not pushing anything.
You are.

10:11.601 --> 10:14.500
You don't get to decide when
I'm ready to say "I love you!"

10:18.535 --> 10:22.902
Ah, the premature
"I love you."

10:22.903 --> 10:27.202
I guessed "premature."
Does that count?

10:33.583 --> 10:34.783
Penny.

10:35.610 --> 10:36.809
Penny.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.439
Penny.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.240
What?

10:43.241 --> 10:44.874
This is for you.

10:46.308 --> 10:47.841
Ice cream?

10:47.842 --> 10:51.408
I've been familiarizing myself
with female emotional crises

10:51.409 --> 10:54.676
<i>by studying the
comic strip Cathy.</i>

10:56.577 --> 11:00.877
When she's upset, she says,
"Ack!" and eats ice cream.

11:03.411 --> 11:05.511
Um...

11:05.512 --> 11:07.144
Ack!

11:08.579 --> 11:12.312
If you were a cat, I would have
brought you a lasagna.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.812
Did Leonard send you over here?

11:15.813 --> 11:17.513
No, we haven't spoken

11:17.514 --> 11:19.413
since your abrupt departure
last night

11:19.414 --> 11:20.947
caused us to forfeit to Stuart

11:20.948 --> 11:23.214
and his dastardly ringer
Wil Wheaton.

11:23.215 --> 11:25.281
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

11:25.282 --> 11:28.849
I'm not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.016
Again, I'm sorry.

11:30.017 --> 11:32.216
And let me tell you,
sleep did not

11:32.217 --> 11:34.282
come easily with Leonard
in the next room

11:34.283 --> 11:37.250
singing along
with Alanis Morrisette.

11:39.018 --> 11:40.283
You're kidding.

11:40.284 --> 11:43.084
No. Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

11:44.119 --> 11:45.785
All right, Sheldon,
what part of this

11:45.786 --> 11:47.252
is supposed to make me
feel better?

11:47.253 --> 11:48.885
The part where
I tell you

11:48.886 --> 11:50.285
I've engineered a rematch

11:50.286 --> 11:52.586
with Stuart's team
for tonight.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.487
Oh, honey, I don't know.

11:54.488 --> 11:56.420
Things are a little weird
with Leonard right now.

11:56.421 --> 11:58.587
You want me to remove
him from the team?

11:58.588 --> 12:00.388
I'm the captain.
I can do that.

12:00.389 --> 12:03.022
No, no, that's okay.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.589
Just let me talk to him,
and I'll get back to you.

12:05.590 --> 12:08.322
When are you going
to talk to him?

12:08.323 --> 12:10.590
I don't know.

12:10.591 --> 12:12.890
He's in the laundry room now.
Now woulbe a good time.

12:12.891 --> 12:16.124
You're not gonna leave me alone
until I do it, are you?

12:16.125 --> 12:19.457
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.159
I think we should
talk now.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.860
Wha...? No, it's okay.

12:29.861 --> 12:32.460
We don't have to talk 'cause
there's nothing to talk about.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.494
Everything's good.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.061
Really?

12:35.062 --> 12:36.560
So, you didn't get all snarky

12:36.561 --> 12:39.895
'cause I said somethingice
to a bowl of chili fries?

12:39.896 --> 12:42.995
All right, maybe I overreacted.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.429
So we're in two different places
emotionally. So what?

12:46.430 --> 12:49.397
And maybe I'm a little ahead
of you. That's fine.

12:49.398 --> 12:52.197
In fact, it makes sense,
'cause let's face it,

12:52.198 --> 12:55.164
I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

12:57.133 --> 13:00.399
<i>Look, Leonard, you have
how much I care about you.</i>

13:00.400 --> 13:02.298
It's just that I've
said the "L" word

13:02.299 --> 13:05.566
too soon before, and it
didn't work out very well.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.199
Really?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.767
I wouldn't know
what that's like.

13:08.768 --> 13:10.100
I'm sorry.

13:10.101 --> 13:12.067
You know what I'm
talking about, though.

13:12.068 --> 13:13.035
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

13:13.036 --> 13:15.468
So, we're good?

13:15.469 --> 13:18.068
Yes, that's what
I'm telling you.

13:18.069 --> 13:20.302
We are good. We are great.

13:20.303 --> 13:22.403
All right! Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

13:22.404 --> 13:24.536
Time to bowl!

13:25.804 --> 13:26.936
Yes, I was eavesdropping.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.771
There's a lot at stake here.

13:31.538 --> 13:33.304
Attention, all bowlers:

13:33.305 --> 13:36.805
I've taken the liberty of having
these made for our rematch.

13:39.106 --> 13:40.673
"The Wesley Crushers"?

13:40.674 --> 13:42.073
No, not The Wesley Crushers.

13:42.074 --> 13:44.306
<i>The Wesley Crushers.</i>

13:44.307 --> 13:45.440
I don't get it.

13:45.441 --> 13:46.674
Wesley Crusher was

13:46.675 --> 13:49.541
<i>Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.</i>

13:49.542 --> 13:50.775
Still don't get it.

13:50.776 --> 13:53.142
It's a blindingly clever play
on words.

13:53.143 --> 13:55.776
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S,

13:55.777 --> 14:00.443
<i>we imply that we we'll be
the crushers of Wesley.</i>

14:01.377 --> 14:02.643
Okay, I'm sorry, honey,

14:02.644 --> 14:04.877
but The Wesley Crushers sounds
like a bunch of people

14:04.878 --> 14:06.044
who like Wesley Crusher.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.245
No! Again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

14:08.246 --> 14:10.811
<i>It's the Wesley Crushers.</i>

14:11.880 --> 14:15.546
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley,

14:15.547 --> 14:17.646
<i>it'd be the Wesley Crushers.</i>

14:17.647 --> 14:19.579
Do you people even hear
yourselves?

14:19.580 --> 14:21.247
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

14:21.248 --> 14:22.580
<i>It's not The Wesley Crushers.</i>

14:22.581 --> 14:25.114
<i>It's The Wesley Crushers.</i>

14:25.115 --> 14:26.214
Hey, look.

14:26.215 --> 14:28.081
They named their team after me.

14:29.149 --> 14:30.615
No, it's not the...

14:30.616 --> 14:32.282
Never mind.

14:34.550 --> 14:38.450
So, we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

14:38.451 --> 14:41.217
Oh, yes. The losers will be
publicly humiliated

14:41.218 --> 14:43.484
in a fashion to be chosen
by the victor.

14:43.485 --> 14:47.352
I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper

14:47.353 --> 14:50.952
expounding the discredited
Velikovsky hypothesis.

14:51.787 --> 14:54.286
Ouch again.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.253
Hey, Sheldon,

14:58.255 --> 14:59.720
I just wanted you to know

14:59.721 --> 15:01.754
that I'm really looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

15:01.755 --> 15:03.021
Oh, yes?

15:03.022 --> 15:06.689
Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

15:06.690 --> 15:09.689
Is your mother
a good or poor bowler?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.190
After you.

15:17.191 --> 15:19.224
No, after you... as we are

15:19.225 --> 15:23.024
currently crushing you, Wesley.

15:24.426 --> 15:26.059
It's customary

15:26.060 --> 15:29.426
for the player on the right-hand
lane to bowl first.

15:30.694 --> 15:32.726
All right.

15:40.862 --> 15:42.695
It's a custom, not a rule.

15:42.696 --> 15:46.029
I so loathe you.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.096
That's right, Sheldon.

15:48.097 --> 15:50.430
Embrace the dark side.

15:52.597 --> 15:55.397
That's not even
from your franchise!

15:56.265 --> 15:58.265
I, um, I want you
to know that

15:58.266 --> 16:01.699
even though we're
on opposite sides,

16:01.700 --> 16:03.932
I, I bear you no ill will.

16:03.933 --> 16:06.399
Thank you, Stuart.
It's nice to know.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.700
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.233
People from
opposite sides

16:09.234 --> 16:10.866
often have good
relationships.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.567
You know,
Romeo and Juliet...

16:12.568 --> 16:15.301
<i>Tony and Maria
from West Side Story,</i>

16:15.302 --> 16:20.369
<i>what's-his-name and the
big blue chick in Avatar.</i>

16:21.370 --> 16:23.602
I'm gonna bowl now.

16:26.538 --> 16:28.370
Be the ball, Howard.

16:28.371 --> 16:30.937
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.972
You weren't the ball.

16:42.207 --> 16:44.907
Hey, thanks.

16:44.908 --> 16:46.206
This is fun, huh?

16:46.207 --> 16:47.506
Yeah.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.574
It's good that we got out
and did something physical.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.041
Mm-hmm.
Gets us out of our heads.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.541
You get in your head,

16:53.542 --> 16:55.241
you start to overthink,
overanalyze,

16:55.242 --> 16:56.542
obsess, you worry.

16:56.543 --> 16:58.042
That's not what
we're doing tonight.

16:58.043 --> 17:00.042
Tonight we're just throwing
a ball at some pins.

17:00.043 --> 17:01.476
Yeah, that's right.

17:01.477 --> 17:03.177
Mm-hmm, and someday--
we don't know when--

17:03.178 --> 17:04.876
maybe you'll love me back.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.444
Ooh, I'm up.

17:11.112 --> 17:14.311
ALL
Shel-don! Shel-don!
Shel-don! Shel-don!

17:14.311 --> 17:15.912
Excuse me.

17:15.913 --> 17:20.280
<i>I don't know who you're chanting
for as I am currently the ball.</i>

17:21.614 --> 17:24.047
The ball! The ball!

17:24.048 --> 17:29.548
The ball! The ball!
The ball! The ball!

17:30.348 --> 17:32.449
Thank you, Jesus!

17:34.650 --> 17:36.549
As my mother would say.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.817
I'm glad you
patched things up

17:42.818 --> 17:44.150
with your boyfriend.

17:44.151 --> 17:46.217
Oh, yeah, me, too.

17:46.218 --> 17:48.251
It's always tough when
the "L" bomb gets dropped

17:48.252 --> 17:49.884
and you're not
ready for it.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.351
Tell me about it.

17:51.352 --> 17:53.152
I dated this one girl,

17:53.153 --> 17:56.052
and I told her
that I loved her,

17:56.053 --> 17:58.386
and she said
she wasn't sure.

17:58.387 --> 18:01.320
And she strung me along
for almost two years.

18:01.321 --> 18:02.587
It was brutal.

18:02.588 --> 18:04.587
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:04.588 --> 18:05.787
Thanks.

18:05.788 --> 18:08.655
I wish she had just broken up
with me right there,

18:08.656 --> 18:11.122
and put me out
of my misery.

18:11.123 --> 18:12.122
Really?

18:12.123 --> 18:13.522
Yeah, would have
been kinder.

18:13.523 --> 18:14.823
Wil, you're up.

18:14.824 --> 18:16.457
Oh, that's me.

18:20.858 --> 18:23.691
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

18:23.692 --> 18:24.958
What are you talking about?

18:24.959 --> 18:27.759
He's evil.
He plays evil mind games.

18:27.759 --> 18:29.625
Did he tell you
his grandmother died?

18:29.626 --> 18:30.692
No!

18:30.693 --> 18:32.493
Well, if he does,
don't believe it.

18:32.494 --> 18:35.126
He's not above playing
the dead meemaw card.

18:38.462 --> 18:40.527
Yes!

18:40.528 --> 18:43.028
Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton,

18:43.029 --> 18:45.161
<i>but like your time
on Star Trek: Next Generation,</i>

18:45.162 --> 18:48.628
your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.296
Penny, you're up.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.363
All right, remember,
his meemaw's alive

18:53.364 --> 18:54.530
and be the ball.

18:54.531 --> 18:56.430
Yeah, I got it.

18:56.431 --> 18:57.964
We really need
a strike here.

18:57.965 --> 18:58.931
I know.

18:58.932 --> 19:00.798
So just take your time
and concentrate.

19:00.799 --> 19:01.765
Leonard, stop pressuring me.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.832
I'm not pressuring you.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.698
Yeah, you are!
Just back off!

19:04.699 --> 19:06.466
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.499
I'll shut up.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.166
I didn't mean "shut up."

19:11.167 --> 19:15.134
Fine. Just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.967
No...

19:17.968 --> 19:19.135
this isn't fair

19:19.136 --> 19:20.835
to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.

19:22.169 --> 19:23.502
Wait! Where are you going?

19:23.503 --> 19:24.836
Penny, come back!

19:24.837 --> 19:26.203
I'll get you ice cream!

19:26.204 --> 19:28.503
No, let her go.

19:28.504 --> 19:29.636
Are you insane?

19:29.637 --> 19:31.837
If she leaves, it's over!

19:31.838 --> 19:35.170
I'm pretty sure
it's already over.

19:35.171 --> 19:37.904
Tough luck, Sheldon.

19:39.172 --> 19:41.805
You did this, didn't you?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.972
Do you think I would
really break up a couple

19:43.973 --> 19:45.372
just to win
a bowling match?

19:45.373 --> 19:47.740
No, I suppose not.

19:47.741 --> 19:49.806
Good. Keep thinking that.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.974
<i>Whea-ton!</i>

20:01.310 --> 20:02.644
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah,
I'm telling you,

20:02.810 --> 20:07.143
the Match.com chicks are much
looser than on eHarmony.

20:09.278 --> 20:11.444
You know,
I-I gotta call you back.

20:11.445 --> 20:14.078
I won a bet,
and it's time to collect.

20:27.548 --> 20:30.781
I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.
