01:06.598 --> 01:08.165
Your turn.

01:08.167 --> 01:10.767
- Uhmmmm...uhnn.

01:10.769 --> 01:13.703
Now you.

01:13.705 --> 01:14.538
- Hey, Patrick.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.907
- Yeah, SpongeBob?

01:16.909 --> 01:19.843
Do you think maybe it would make
the game more exciting

01:19.845 --> 01:25.148
if we played it with...
two sticks?

01:25.150 --> 01:25.849
- Two sticks?

01:25.851 --> 01:26.817
That's against the rules.

01:26.819 --> 01:29.386
You can't change the rules,
SpongeBob,

01:29.388 --> 01:30.887
just because I'm winning.

01:30.889 --> 01:31.888
- I'm sorry, Patrick.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.224
I'm just so bored playing stick
and a cup.

01:34.226 --> 01:38.161
<i>- Are you tired of playing with</i>
<i>the old stick and a cup?</i>

01:38.163 --> 01:38.829
Yeah.

01:38.831 --> 01:42.466
<i>- Well, say good-bye to boring,</i>
<i>and hello to Whirly Brains,</i>

01:42.468 --> 01:46.303
<i>the exciting new toy that puts</i>
<i>you in the driver's seat</i>

01:46.305 --> 01:47.437
<i>of your own mind!</i>

01:47.439 --> 01:49.806
<i>It's so simple.</i>
<i>Just flip your lid,</i>

01:49.808 --> 01:50.807
<i>attach the propeller,</i>

01:50.809 --> 01:54.444
<i>and watch your brain soar</i>
<i>hundreds of feet into the air</i>

01:54.446 --> 01:56.713
<i>as you control the action.</i>

02:02.354 --> 02:03.720
Ahhhh.

02:03.722 --> 02:08.491
<i>- Get your Whirly Brain today,</i>
<i>and free your mind!</i>

02:08.494 --> 02:10.426
- Free my mind!
Free my mind!

02:10.429 --> 02:11.595
Free my mind!

02:13.265 --> 02:15.332
I want it. I want it.
I want it. No, I want it.

02:15.334 --> 02:19.469
No, it's mine. I want it.
I want it. I want it.

02:19.837 --> 02:22.939
- Sorry to hear about your TV,
SpongeBob.

02:22.941 --> 02:26.643
<i>- Whirly Brains are available</i>
<i>now at Bikini Bottom Toy Shop.</i>

02:26.645 --> 02:28.612
Whirly Brains!
Whirly Brains!

02:28.614 --> 02:33.583
Whirly Brains! Whirly Brains!
Whirly Brains!

02:35.453 --> 02:37.320
- Okay, Patrick, just let me
flip your lid,

02:37.322 --> 02:41.291
so I can attach the propeller
directly to your brain.

02:44.763 --> 02:45.562
- Buh-ha-ha.

02:45.564 --> 02:51.601
- Step one...oh, I
see what to do.

02:51.603 --> 02:52.936
Ahhh!

02:52.938 --> 02:54.838
- Ahhh!

02:54.840 --> 02:56.740
- It's just me, Patrick.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.842
- Ohhh.

03:01.747 --> 03:02.879
- Now you do me.

03:02.881 --> 03:07.551
- Boo!
- Ahhh!

03:07.553 --> 03:12.389
It's time to free our minds.

03:16.628 --> 03:17.394
Whoa, Patrick.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.262
I've never seen the world from
this angle before.

03:19.264 --> 03:24.034
- And the propeller tickles my
think folds.

03:25.704 --> 03:29.439
Hey. Hey.
Hey, SpongeBob, eye bump.

03:29.441 --> 03:30.707
- Eye bump.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.409
Ow!

03:32.411 --> 03:34.878
Patrick, no more eye bumps,
okay?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.980
- I feel you.

03:53.899 --> 03:56.066
Brain freeze!

04:01.006 --> 04:02.505
- Meow.

04:04.476 --> 04:05.609
- Hey, Patrick.

04:05.611 --> 04:09.479
♪ I know who we can spy on ♪

04:09.481 --> 04:12.649
- Ahh, the sanctity of my
bathroom,

04:12.651 --> 04:15.952
the only place in the world
where I can

04:15.954 --> 04:19.322
let it all hang out.

04:19.324 --> 04:23.827
Ahh, me.

04:23.829 --> 04:25.095
- Hey, where's Squidward?

04:25.097 --> 04:27.797
I'm sure I saw him in here.

04:27.799 --> 04:29.866
- Well, maybe he fell in the
toilet?

04:29.868 --> 04:31.768
I'll check.

04:33.871 --> 04:36.640
Squidward,
are you in here?

04:36.642 --> 04:38.775
Did you fall in?

04:38.777 --> 04:39.909
Squidward!

04:39.911 --> 04:41.945
- Stop serenading me, you sap.

04:41.947 --> 04:47.384
It's my day off.
Now, go away.

04:47.386 --> 04:48.118
- Ahh!

04:48.120 --> 04:49.853
- Found him.

04:49.855 --> 04:51.554
- Yup, that's him.

04:51.556 --> 04:53.490
Hi, Squidward.

04:53.492 --> 04:57.360
- Aliens from Mars!
It's an invasion!

04:57.362 --> 04:58.895
Waaahhhh!

04:58.897 --> 04:59.829
Ugh!

05:06.138 --> 05:08.138
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:08.140 --> 05:09.773
Whoooa!

05:09.775 --> 05:12.676
Whoo-whoo!

05:12.678 --> 05:16.813
Whirly Brains are go!

05:29.461 --> 05:32.696
- She spit in his face.

05:35.634 --> 05:38.935
- Mrs. Puff, we've been dating
for 16 years now,

05:38.937 --> 05:41.638
so I was sincerely hoping that
today

05:41.640 --> 05:43.506
might finally be the day that...

05:43.508 --> 05:44.474
- Yes, Eugene?

05:44.476 --> 05:46.609
- That I steal a little kiss?

05:46.611 --> 05:47.110
- Oh.

05:47.112 --> 05:51.881
Oh, Eugene, I thought you'd
never ask.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.785
- C'mere you.

05:57.489 --> 05:58.621
- Ohh.

05:58.623 --> 06:00.523
- What a woman.

06:00.525 --> 06:02.892
- Oh, Eugene.

06:10.001 --> 06:12.435
Ow.
What was that?

06:12.437 --> 06:14.104
- Ooh, that smarts.

06:14.106 --> 06:15.772
Bull's-eye.

06:15.774 --> 06:18.641
- I thought we were the first
kids on the block

06:18.643 --> 06:20.477
to get Whirly Brains.

06:20.479 --> 06:21.244
- What are you, thick?

06:21.246 --> 06:23.880
Every kid in
town's got a Whirly Brain.

06:23.882 --> 06:26.149
Pssh!

06:28.119 --> 06:31.488
- Daddy, Daddy, can I have a
Whirly Brain too?

06:31.490 --> 06:32.322
- Absolutely not, son.

06:32.324 --> 06:35.892
Your brain is your body's most
important organ, not a toy.

06:37.229 --> 06:40.029
- Pow!

06:40.031 --> 06:40.797
- Hooray!

06:40.799 --> 06:43.233
Now we can play Whirly Brains
with the whole neighborhood.

06:43.235 --> 06:45.835
Hey, kid, race you the end of
the street.

06:45.837 --> 06:49.172
- Eat my brain stem, slowpoke.

06:50.942 --> 06:53.843
- Get ready, get set, punch it.

06:59.651 --> 07:01.951
- Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.787
- Ahh! Ohh! Huh?

07:03.789 --> 07:05.922
- Yes!
We're gonna beat him, Patrick.

07:05.924 --> 07:08.758
We're gonna win!

07:10.561 --> 07:13.663
- Fly your toys into my yard,
will you?

07:13.665 --> 07:16.566
Well, they're mine now.

07:19.104 --> 07:21.671
- Hey, what's going on?
Everything went dark.

07:21.673 --> 07:22.872
Patrick, can you see
anything?

07:22.874 --> 07:27.610
- Only the dismal abyss of black
nothingness.

07:27.612 --> 07:29.145
- Oh, our remote controls are
dead too.

07:29.147 --> 07:32.282
Oh, Patrick, I don't want to
jump to any conclusions here,

07:32.284 --> 07:36.252
but I think that we have lost
our minds.

07:39.057 --> 07:42.892
M-O-O-N.

07:42.894 --> 07:44.594
That spells moon.

07:47.098 --> 07:48.531
- Okay, don't panic, Patrick.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.200
We'll find them.
Just take it easy.

07:50.202 --> 07:53.002
Take it easy.
Patrick, take it easy!

07:53.004 --> 07:55.038
- I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.807
- Our brains are probably right
around here somewhere.

07:57.809 --> 07:59.909
Here, brains.
Brains.

07:59.911 --> 08:01.211
Here, boy.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.712
- Here, brains.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.114
- Brainy, where are you?

08:05.116 --> 08:06.716
- Brain, brain, brain.

08:06.718 --> 08:09.219
I think I found it, SpongeBob.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.987
- I found mine too.

08:10.989 --> 08:12.622
Aw, darn it.
I still can't see.

08:12.624 --> 08:17.861
- Yeah, and my brain won't fit
back in.

08:18.663 --> 08:20.730
- Oh, uh, ma'am,
you forgot something.

08:20.732 --> 08:22.932
- That's okay.
You can keep it.

08:22.934 --> 08:26.135
- I'll take it.

08:26.137 --> 08:29.072
Oh, yeah, looking good.

08:29.074 --> 08:30.206
- Ew.
Gimme that.

08:30.208 --> 08:33.876
- Aw, man, that felt all
squishy.

08:34.613 --> 08:37.246
- Patrick, we need help.
Let's call Sandy.

08:37.249 --> 08:39.582
- Okay.
Sandy!

08:39.583 --> 08:42.852
- Patrick, I meant on the phone.

08:42.854 --> 08:43.953
-<i> Hello?</i>

08:43.955 --> 08:46.890
Sandy!

08:46.892 --> 08:47.423
- Dang.

08:47.425 --> 08:49.025
You two sure are lucky I
created this

08:49.027 --> 08:50.693
missing brain
detector last summer.

08:50.695 --> 08:53.263
I was beginning to think I'd
never get to use this thing.

08:53.265 --> 08:55.298
- I hope we find our brains
soon.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.800
They're probably cold and hungry
by now.

08:57.802 --> 08:58.468
Poor things.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.236
- Brain?
- Brain, where are you?

09:00.238 --> 09:01.271
- Hey, brain.
- Oof!

09:01.273 --> 09:02.805
- Come out.
We're looking for you.

09:02.807 --> 09:05.842
- And it looks like you're not
the only critters around these

09:05.844 --> 09:07.710
parts to lose your minds.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.178
Hmm, and my
detector

09:09.180 --> 09:13.917
is leading us directly
to that house.

09:15.353 --> 09:17.120
- Excuse me, kind sir.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.055
Would you mind too terribly if
we just came in your house for a

09:19.057 --> 09:22.759
minute and looked around for my
friend's missing brains?

09:23.995 --> 09:27.196
- We're gonna take that as a
yes.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.798
Step lively, fellas.

09:29.501 --> 09:34.037
- This place has a ten-gallon
case of the creepies.

09:34.039 --> 09:35.738
I wonder what's in...

09:35.740 --> 09:39.042
Hey, fellas.
I think I found your brains.

09:39.044 --> 09:40.977
Hooray!

09:40.979 --> 09:42.011
- Hey. Huh?

09:42.013 --> 09:43.746
- What are you sneak thieves
doing in my house?

09:43.748 --> 09:48.785
Them brains violated my air
space, and I'm keeping 'em.

09:48.787 --> 09:49.886
I'm calling the cops.

09:49.888 --> 09:51.287
Oh, don't send us to jail.
Oh, no, no, no.

09:51.289 --> 09:52.922
Please, no, no.
I don't want to go to jail

09:52.924 --> 09:54.324
We were just having fun.
We're sorry.

09:54.326 --> 09:56.059
- Sorry nothing.
Look old-timer, one false move,

09:56.061 --> 10:00.163
and I'll be on you like a
horsefly on a cracker barrel.

10:00.165 --> 10:01.864
- Bring it on, slippy whiskers.

10:01.866 --> 10:05.034
I'll twenty-three skiddoo your
bee's knees

10:05.036 --> 10:06.235
with wooden nickels,
sister.

10:06.237 --> 10:09.405
- All right, now, you listen to
me, ya twisted coot.

10:09.407 --> 10:10.940
You can't steal somebody's brain

10:10.942 --> 10:12.241
just because it flies
into your yard.

10:12.243 --> 10:15.378
That's "brainnapping,"
and it looks like I'll be

10:15.380 --> 10:16.813
the one calling the police.

10:16.815 --> 10:19.949
- Ooh, I love it when Sandy gets
aggressive.

10:19.951 --> 10:21.117
Let's give her some room.

10:21.119 --> 10:25.021
Yow!
- Oof!

10:25.023 --> 10:25.955
- Oh.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.360
- Oh, Brainy, you're back.

10:30.362 --> 10:34.731
Oh! Hey-hey-hey!

10:34.733 --> 10:35.231
- Ahh!

10:35.233 --> 10:38.935
Phew, I'll never be a
"no-brainer" again.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.270
- Everyone has their brains
back,

10:41.272 --> 10:42.405
so I'ma let it go this time,

10:42.407 --> 10:46.109
but if you steal as much as a
beach ball, so help me, I'll...

10:46.111 --> 10:50.146
- I'm sorry, squirrel lady,

10:50.148 --> 10:54.183
I just couldn't take watching
all the kids have fun in the

10:54.185 --> 10:57.120
air while I'm stuck here with
this

10:57.122 --> 10:59.922
crotchety cane on the ground.

10:59.924 --> 11:00.757
Awwww.

11:00.759 --> 11:03.259
- Well, I think we've got a cure
for what ails you,

11:03.261 --> 11:04.027
right, SpongeBob?

11:04.029 --> 11:06.396
- Sandy, are you thinking what
I'm thinking?

11:06.398 --> 11:08.798
- I think I'm thinking what
you're thinking.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.803
- Patrick?
- My think is clogged.

11:13.805 --> 11:16.172
- Wahhh-hoo-hoo!

11:16.174 --> 11:18.408
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

11:18.410 --> 11:20.176
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!

11:20.178 --> 11:23.413
- Sure was nice of you two to
donate your Whirly Brains

11:23.415 --> 11:24.414
to the old-timer.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.349
You fellas did a good deed
today.

11:26.351 --> 11:27.984
- Oh, no need to thank us,
Sandy.

11:27.986 --> 11:31.054
If we can just make one angry
old man happy,

11:31.056 --> 11:32.789
that in itself is thanks
enough.

11:32.791 --> 11:36.059
The dignity of the elderly
was the victor here today.

11:36.061 --> 11:38.394
- Ha-ha!
Look out, ladies!

11:38.396 --> 11:42.231
Take a ride
on the love-copter.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.133
- The Martians are coming!

11:44.135 --> 11:46.169
Run for your lives!

11:46.171 --> 11:47.904
You're next!

11:47.906 --> 11:49.839
You're next!

12:01.553 --> 12:05.521

12:12.297 --> 12:15.631
<i>- Never mind.</i>
<i>It's just this idiot.</i>

12:15.633 --> 12:18.401
- Argh!

12:18.403 --> 12:19.969
- By the power of Neptune...

12:19.971 --> 12:24.373
Mermaid
Man and Barnacle Boy unite!

12:24.375 --> 12:27.043
- To the invisible boatmobile.

12:27.045 --> 12:28.978
- Yay.

12:40.190 --> 12:43.459
- This must be the secret lair
of an evil villain.

12:43.461 --> 12:46.696
- You're right.

12:46.698 --> 12:49.165
- Wah-ha!

12:56.207 --> 12:57.673
- Oh!

12:57.675 --> 13:01.043
Looks like there's evil afoot.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.045
- And littering is a crime.
- What?

13:03.047 --> 13:06.749
I thought I had my house
sponge-and-star-proofed.

13:06.751 --> 13:08.684
- Hey, Squidward, want to play
Mermaid Man

13:08.686 --> 13:10.486
and Barnacle Boy with us?

13:10.488 --> 13:11.154
- No!

13:11.156 --> 13:14.657
Now, please fall and get
seriously hurt.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.492
Ahh!

13:16.494 --> 13:19.028
- Ugh! Oof!

13:19.030 --> 13:21.464
- I'm sure I've heard that "no"
before.

13:21.466 --> 13:24.734
- Holy something, Mermaid Man.
You can't mean--

13:24.736 --> 13:26.602
- Yes, my young, pink ward.

13:26.604 --> 13:30.606
It's none other than...

13:30.608 --> 13:31.440
Doctor Negative.

13:31.442 --> 13:34.210
- ♪ I hate SpongeBob, and I hate
Patrick ♪

13:34.212 --> 13:36.679
- It's that denying desperado's
siren song.

13:36.681 --> 13:40.483
- ♪ Loathing SpongeBob, scorning
Patrick la-la-la-la-la-la ♪

13:40.485 --> 13:44.086
- He's obviously raising an army
of mutant vegetables.

13:44.088 --> 13:45.755
And that song he's singing...

13:45.757 --> 13:48.191
Will bring them to life.

13:49.561 --> 13:51.093
Hyah!

14:02.739 --> 14:04.173
Although our foes were evil,

14:04.175 --> 14:08.511
their nutrition did not go to
waste, Doctor Negative.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.280
- We're watching you.

14:11.282 --> 14:12.481
- That's it!

14:12.483 --> 14:16.652
I'm gonna clobber you two!

14:17.554 --> 14:19.488
- Hey, Squidward, do you hear
that?

14:20.325 --> 14:22.225
You better hurry up or you'll be
late for work.

14:22.227 --> 14:27.597
- Yeah, you better do something
or whatever.

14:40.144 --> 14:41.177
Ohh.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.341
Will you two shut up about that
stupid show?

15:12.343 --> 15:17.747
- Oh, did you say something
negative, Doctor Negative?

15:17.749 --> 15:18.581
- What the--how did--

15:18.583 --> 15:20.683
- I heard him say something
negative.

15:23.354 --> 15:26.822
- Mermaid Man, that injured
victim's bandages

15:26.824 --> 15:27.890
have come undone.

15:27.892 --> 15:30.526
- That poor man needs aid...

15:30.528 --> 15:34.864
of the first variety.

15:41.438 --> 15:44.707
- Oh,
we forgot the peroxide.

15:47.345 --> 15:49.378
- That should hold you until the
surgeons

15:49.380 --> 15:50.880
can amputate your torso.

15:50.882 --> 15:52.782
- Hmmph.

15:52.784 --> 15:53.849
Justice restored!

15:53.851 --> 15:59.588
- Hey, super dorks, your turn to
take out the garbage.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.858
- All right, Dr. Negative, we'll
play

16:02.860 --> 16:04.760
along and take it out.

16:04.762 --> 16:06.562
Hiyah!

16:20.511 --> 16:22.678
Why are all my tables
empty?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.280
Why am I not making money?

16:24.282 --> 16:28.951
- Because these two costumed
creeps chased them out.

16:29.954 --> 16:35.658
- Oh. Mr. Squidward, step into
me office.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.492
- Uh-oh, Patrick.

16:36.494 --> 16:38.461
I think we got Squidward in
trouble.

16:38.463 --> 16:41.964
- I'm gonna share a secret with
you that I never told anyone.

16:41.966 --> 16:46.902
- Uh, that's okay.
I don't need to hear a...

16:46.904 --> 16:48.604
Hmm?

16:49.506 --> 16:51.974
- Ha! Ha-ha.
You're a comic book geek.

16:51.976 --> 16:53.476
- Ahh!

16:53.478 --> 16:54.410
Don't touch those.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.846
They're mint condition,
worth a fortune.

16:56.848 --> 16:59.215
- So you read comics.
Don't worry.

16:59.217 --> 17:02.618
Lots of perfectly immature
adults read comics.

17:02.620 --> 17:07.990
- Oh, it's deeper than that.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.392
I sewed it meself.

17:09.394 --> 17:11.894
It's Captain
Tightwad from issue 53.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.396
They say he's a bad guy, but,
you know,

17:14.398 --> 17:15.998
I think he's just
misunderstood.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.935
- Oh, look at that.
I think I left my oven on.

17:19.936 --> 17:24.673
- I had some fabric left over,
so I made this.

17:24.675 --> 17:28.644
- Oh, don't tell me...
Doctor Negative?

17:28.646 --> 17:30.980
<i>- Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits.</i>

17:32.650 --> 17:38.421
- Tremble before Captain
Tightwad!

17:38.423 --> 17:40.823
Squidward.

17:40.825 --> 17:45.861
- And cower in fear of Doctor
Negative.

17:45.863 --> 17:46.662
- Holy shrimp.

17:46.664 --> 17:48.798
This is the best day of my life.

17:54.539 --> 17:56.539
Whoa! Oh!

17:56.541 --> 17:58.641
Whoa-ho! Whoa!

17:59.911 --> 18:02.845
- What're you waiting for?
- Augh!

18:02.847 --> 18:05.047
Ugh!

18:08.386 --> 18:11.387
Ugh! Ow! Ow!

18:19.963 --> 18:22.698
- Hyahhh!

18:24.968 --> 18:27.336
- Why are we fighting Captain
Tightwad?

18:27.338 --> 18:29.038
He didn't even commit a
crime.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.306
- What--what do you mean?

18:30.308 --> 18:31.974
- Oh, Mr. Krabs, it's right here
in

18:31.976 --> 18:32.942
"Mermaid Man" number 98.

18:32.944 --> 18:35.344
"No superhero shall fight a
super villain

18:35.346 --> 18:38.848
until that super villain
has committed a crime."

18:38.850 --> 18:41.617
- Uh...well...hey.

18:44.387 --> 18:45.654
Ha-ha, see?

18:45.656 --> 18:46.989
I just stole some money.

18:46.991 --> 18:51.827
- Well, it's not really stealing
if it's your own money.

18:51.829 --> 18:52.661
- Oh, come on.

18:52.663 --> 18:55.664
What do--what do I have to do
here?

18:55.666 --> 18:57.066
- Ahh-ahh-ahh!

18:57.068 --> 18:58.667
<i>- Are you sure about this?</i>

18:58.669 --> 19:00.536
Isn't robbing a bank against the
law?

19:00.538 --> 19:02.571
- Well, yes, Mr. Krabs, but
you're not really

19:02.573 --> 19:05.007
robbing a bank.
You're just pretending to.

19:05.009 --> 19:07.810
- And then we can play?
- Yep.

19:07.812 --> 19:09.712
- Oh, okay.

19:09.714 --> 19:10.880
Ahoy.

19:10.882 --> 19:11.680
Anyone home?

19:11.682 --> 19:15.017
It's Captain
Tightwad and Doctor Negative.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.485
We're
here to rob you.

19:16.487 --> 19:18.087
Anyone here?
Hello?

19:20.358 --> 19:22.391
Barnacled nickels.

19:22.393 --> 19:23.893
Can I
help you ladies?

19:23.895 --> 19:25.794
- Oh, yeah, thanks, old-timer.

19:25.796 --> 19:28.030
Um, we're pretending to rob this
bank.

19:28.032 --> 19:30.733
Where's the tellers?
Where's the money?

19:30.735 --> 19:31.901
- Ain't no tellers.

19:31.903 --> 19:35.070
ATM's outside.

19:35.072 --> 19:36.405
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

19:36.407 --> 19:39.475
- Aw, barnacles.
I forgot me debit card.

19:39.477 --> 19:40.509
- Wait a minute.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.645
I don't care if you
are ladies.

19:42.647 --> 19:45.814
Nobody pretends to rob
my bank.

19:45.816 --> 19:48.517
- Ahh!

19:48.519 --> 19:49.652
- Ahh!

19:52.690 --> 19:53.923
Ow!

19:53.925 --> 19:56.058
Ehh...

19:57.662 --> 19:59.428
- Whoa, you were so convincing.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.096
You
had that guard totally fooled.

20:01.098 --> 20:03.165
I think we can skip to the end
of the story.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.601
Let's just stop here to pick
up some props

20:05.603 --> 20:06.468
for your evil lair.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.939
We'll just need a few dollars...
yoink!

20:09.941 --> 20:11.774
- I'm supposed to be the
villain,

20:11.776 --> 20:16.512
so why do I feel like I'm being
robbed?

20:20.618 --> 20:23.185
- Okay Captain Tightwad...

20:23.187 --> 20:26.789
Doctor
Negative, you can come out now.

20:28.125 --> 20:31.627
Ahh!

20:33.164 --> 20:34.196
- Okay, so here's the scene.

20:34.198 --> 20:37.633
You two have us here in this
cage over a pool of boiling oil.

20:37.635 --> 20:38.867
Now, that is a
crime.

20:38.869 --> 20:40.169
Now you can let us out so we
can fight.

20:40.171 --> 20:46.508
- Oh, I don't think we're going
to do that.

20:46.843 --> 20:49.144
- Hey, wha-wha-wha-what are you
doing?

20:49.146 --> 20:50.479
- Being evil.

20:50.481 --> 20:52.114
Isn't that what you wanted?

20:52.116 --> 20:54.216
Aren't you scared?

20:54.218 --> 20:54.950
Boo-hoo?

20:54.952 --> 20:58.621
- Boo-hoo?
Do you expect us to cry?

20:58.623 --> 20:59.755
- No, Mr. Bob.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.757
I expect you to fry.

21:04.695 --> 21:05.894
Ha-ha, ha-ha, hmm.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.964
Okay, Squidward,
playtime's over.

21:08.966 --> 21:10.232
This is getting a
little intense here.

21:10.234 --> 21:15.571
- Too long have I suffered
living between you two ninnies.

21:15.573 --> 21:17.840
But now--
now as Doctor Negative,

21:17.842 --> 21:23.178
I shall finally exact my
exquisite revenge!

21:25.883 --> 21:28.717
- See, I just knew he'd make a
terrific bad guy.

21:28.719 --> 21:29.752
He is really
committing.

21:29.754 --> 21:32.054
- Yeah, you did a great job with
casting.

21:32.056 --> 21:34.823

Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh.

Ahhh!

22:15.132 --> 22:16.031
- Oh, boy, Mr. Krabs.

22:16.033 --> 22:19.635
That was the best Mermaid Man
playdate ever.

22:19.637 --> 22:20.636
- Yeah, not bad.

22:20.638 --> 22:23.806
But next time, we
won't go so easy on ya.

22:23.808 --> 22:26.608
- Eh...
maybe I'll just stick to

22:26.610 --> 22:29.044
reading comics from now on.
