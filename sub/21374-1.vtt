00:17.309 --> 00:19.812
[man] <i>I've read a story this week</i>
<i>about a coach.</i>

00:19.895 --> 00:21.855
<i>His name is Coach Buddy Stephens.</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:25.317
<i>He's the coach at
East Mississippi Community College.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:32.324
<i>He has been featured in a documentary</i>
<i>of their season called</i> Last Chance U.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.201
<i>"Last Chance University."</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:37.871
<i>And it chronicles the story
of all of these young men, who...</i>

00:37.955 --> 00:40.457
<i>It was their last chance to play.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:46.880
<i>And as he watched himself
on that screen...</i>

00:48.256 --> 00:50.258
<i>he didn't like what he saw.</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:55.305
<i>Can you imagine if a documentary
was made about your life?</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:58.642
<i>And they followed you, the good...</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:01.061
<i>and the bad...</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:03.063
<i>and the ugly?</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:06.817
<i>He said, after watching the program...</i>

01:07.525 --> 01:09.612
<i>"I knew we had to change some things.</i>

01:10.988 --> 01:13.240
I <i>had to change some things."</i>

01:15.283 --> 01:20.288
<i>It's not about you waiting
until you get it all together.</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:24.209
<i>It is recognizing that you've made a mess.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:27.713
<i>You need to change some things.</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:38.598
- [retching]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:38.682 --> 01:40.768
- [retches]
- [player 1] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.186
[De'Andre Johnson]
I'm throwing straight broccoli up, son.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.105
I'm throwing up broccoli.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.606
[Buddy] No damn walking anymore.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.984
- [retching]
- [Buddy] If you walk... Hey, yo!

01:49.067 --> 01:51.403
If he walks, he starts it over.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.655
If he walks, he starts it over.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.592
[coach 1] Come on.
One foot in front of the other.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.456
One foot in front of the other, baby.
You gonna have to attack it, baby.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.639
You have to attack it.
If you don't mind, it don't matter.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.263
[Wood] Keep running. Let's go, let's go.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
Trying to get from one end
to the other. Let's go.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.753
[Buddy] Looks like a damn army of men
running right there now.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.004
Looks like a damn army.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.830
[De'Andre] Remember that shit.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.093
It's mind over matter.
If it don't suck, we don't do it.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.471
<i>All right. Let's pray again. Pray again.</i>

02:19.472 --> 02:21.934
Take the hats and stuff off, man.
Slow it down.

02:22.935 --> 02:23.769
Whose father?

02:23.852 --> 02:26.354
[all] Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.774
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

02:28.857 --> 02:33.070
[Buddy] It's good to have everybody here.
It's good to have our team together.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.907
That's something
I've been waiting for for a long time.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.450
Long time.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.578
We got some unfinished business
that we gotta take care of

02:41.745 --> 02:43.747
and it ain't just on the football field.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.209
There's people in this room
got unfinished business.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.878
And there's a lot of talent in this room.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.422
A lot of ass whoopin'
that's fixin' to happen in this room.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.632
But you gotta have one thing.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.967
You gotta have a little...

02:56.051 --> 02:57.969
You gotta be a little bit humble.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.389
[Jason Crowder] <i>Let's face it.</i>
<i>This team was on its way to...</i>

03:01.473 --> 03:02.533
playing for a national championship.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.768
In all likelihood,
winning the national championship.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.938
So you have to go through spring,
you have to go through summer,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.440
um, of thinking what might have been.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.986
<i>Buddy realizes now that arrogance</i>

03:14.069 --> 03:17.030
<i>can cause you to lose sight
of what's important.</i>

03:17.114 --> 03:19.491
<i>And it can... can grip you.</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:23.912
Finally, now,
2015 is behind this football team

03:23.996 --> 03:26.832
and this program can move forward
in a positive manner now.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.055
[Thomas Huebner] <i>We look bigger,</i>
<i>stronger, faster than we did last year.</i>

03:42.139 --> 03:47.269
It's hard not to set a high expectation
when I see these guys on the field.

03:47.352 --> 03:51.064
<i>But in my mind, I'm hoping to win it all,
and I think we have a legitimate shot.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:58.196
De'Andre is an extremely talented kid.
He's very accurate.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.323
<i>Whenever he throws the ball,</i>

04:00.407 --> 04:02.617
<i>it's going to go
wherever he wants to put it.</i>

04:02.700 --> 04:04.411
<i>That's arm talent right there.</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:06.704
<i>Very smart kid. Wants to get better.</i>

04:06.789 --> 04:08.581
<i>Takes that mentality
in everything he does.</i>

04:08.665 --> 04:11.418
I can coach a kid like that,
who made a mistake,

04:11.501 --> 04:13.170
<i>he admitted it, move on from it.</i>

04:13.253 --> 04:16.840
<i>That's what junior colleges are for.
We are Last Chance U for a reason.</i>

04:17.424 --> 04:20.427
We recruited some good athletes.
We got some great athletes coming back.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.387
And the ones coming back,

04:22.471 --> 04:24.765
you've been forged in the fires,
haven't you?

04:25.557 --> 04:29.644
Isaiah? Incredible.
Athletic ability is phenomenal, of course.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.967
Anybody can see that
when you watch him jump over people.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.652
<i>His anticipation of where to make his cuts
is pretty phenomenal.</i>

04:37.735 --> 04:39.672
[Crowder] <i>It's going to be taken</i>
<i>at the goal line by EMCC,</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:41.865
<i>out across the 15, 20...
Great speed across the 30.</i>

04:41.949 --> 04:43.927
<i>- Nobody's gonna catch him.</i>
- [Wood] <i>He's lightning in a bottle.</i>

04:43.951 --> 04:46.787
We've got several guys who have
the ability to make plays at any time.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.581
[Williams] <i>Chauncey Rivers.</i>
<i>He's the best one I got right now.</i>

04:50.207 --> 04:51.666
[grunting]

04:51.749 --> 04:52.918
<i>He was a Georgia signee.</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:55.796
<i>He had a couple of issues,
you know, with possession.</i>

04:55.879 --> 04:58.006
<i>So that's how he ended up
being here with us.</i>

04:58.090 --> 05:00.633
I don't see that type of attitude in him
since he's been here.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.137
<i>He'll be a draft pick one day.
He's that type of talent.</i>

05:04.721 --> 05:07.700
[Ed Holly] <i>Kam was playing at Penn State</i>
<i>and Coach Trickett brought him down.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:09.434
<i>He says, "You gotta look at this guy."</i>

05:09.517 --> 05:13.105
You know when he comes off the ball,
he's a big, strong, fast, tough guy.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.833
He will be a dominant force
in this league.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.650
[Williams] <i>His situation,</i>
<i>dealing with substance abuse,</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
just to deal with everyday social living.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.906
<i>But one thing I just question about Kam
is his mental toughness.</i>

05:23.990 --> 05:26.409
<i>Tim Bonner is a hell of a pass rusher.</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:27.744
<i>Coming to us from Louisville,</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:31.164
<i>and he got into a situation
with a young lady up there,</i>

05:31.248 --> 05:33.834
and the best decision for him
was to leave.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.169
Go! Lean! There you go. There you go.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.255
<i>He's a funny, bright guy.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:40.840
<i>He don't know
when to shut it off sometime,</i>

05:40.924 --> 05:43.551
<i>but, mentally, Tim just has to focus.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:46.554
[Ed Holly] <i>Dakota Allen,</i>
<i>you know, he is a superstar.</i>

05:46.638 --> 05:48.681
<i>Been on this big stage.
He played against LSU.</i>

05:48.765 --> 05:53.311
[announcer] <i>And that ball is intercepted.</i>
<i>Dakota Allen with the pick off.</i>

05:53.395 --> 05:55.414
[Ed Holly] <i>He was Texas Tech's</i>
<i>second-leading tackler last year</i>

05:55.438 --> 05:56.982
<i>with 80-plus tackles.</i>

05:57.065 --> 05:59.317
I don't know all the circumstances
of what happened.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.487
<i>You know, he has a reputation,
but we all make mistakes.</i>

06:02.570 --> 06:04.864
<i>We've all sinned
and come short of the glory of God</i>

06:04.948 --> 06:07.325
<i>and what I know is, is he's a competitor.
He wants to win.</i>

06:07.409 --> 06:09.178
[Ed Holly] <i>When you come to Scooba,</i>
<i>it's a new beginning.</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:11.288
It's a new chapter.
It's like getting baptized.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.123
Whatever happened in the past,
it's done.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.749
<i>Let's just worry about the future.</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:16.019
[Crowder]
<i>I don't think there's any stopping</i>

06:16.043 --> 06:17.483
<i>this East Mississippi football team.</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:20.964
<i>But there is a reputation
around the league</i>

06:21.464 --> 06:24.592
<i>of disdain for Buddy and East Mississippi.</i>

06:24.676 --> 06:27.304
When you have a brawl,
like happened last year,

06:27.387 --> 06:30.307
the accusation of,
"Oh, that roster's full of thugs."

06:30.890 --> 06:33.560
<i>They're gonna prove
that that's not who they are.</i>

06:33.643 --> 06:35.353
Everybody deserves a second chance.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.231
<i>This is America.
America love redemption stories.</i>

06:39.691 --> 06:41.859

[host 1 on radio] <i>502-571-1080.</i>

07:22.109 --> 07:23.526
<i>Let's talk about your homework.</i>

07:23.610 --> 07:25.850
<i>How many of you did your homework,</i>
<i>watched</i> Last Chance U?

07:25.903 --> 07:28.823
<i>What were your thoughts
over the show overall?</i>

07:28.906 --> 07:32.869
[host 2] <i>First of all, I can't believe</i>
<i>this little-bitty town of 700 people</i>

07:32.953 --> 07:35.663
<i>has this massive junior college
football program</i>

07:35.747 --> 07:37.558
<i>where all the major college coaches
go to recruit.</i>

07:37.582 --> 07:39.352
- [host 1] <i>Not just... Like, all of 'em.</i>
- [host 2] <i>Yes.</i>

07:39.376 --> 07:40.728
- [host 1] <i>They all go.</i>
- [host 2] <i>Yes.</i>

07:40.752 --> 07:43.193
[host 2] <i>Nick Saban, you know,</i>
<i>they all go recruit these kids.</i>

07:43.255 --> 07:45.382
[host 1] <i>Their team this year</i>
<i>is supposed to be...</i>

07:45.465 --> 07:46.609
- [host 2] <i>Just as good?</i>
- [host 1] <i>Better.</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:47.842
<i>What about the coach?</i>

07:47.925 --> 07:49.695
[host 2] <i>I've been</i>
<i>in athletics my whole life.</i>

07:49.719 --> 07:51.822
<i>- You run into guys like that.</i>
- [host 1] <i>But do you think...</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:54.432
<i>The offensive coordinator
was the only one they could talk to.</i>

07:54.516 --> 07:55.600
[host 2] <i>Yes, I agree.</i>

07:55.683 --> 07:58.311
[host 1] <i>But then to me,</i>
<i>the unforgivable thing</i>

07:58.395 --> 08:00.647
<i>is what he said to the team afterwards.</i>

08:00.730 --> 08:02.770
<i>When he was sitting there,
calling 'em street thugs.</i>

08:02.815 --> 08:03.858
<i>Like, that made me mad.</i>

08:03.942 --> 08:07.612
<i>First of all, you don't say that.
Like, that language is unacceptable.</i>

08:08.113 --> 08:11.866
[host 2] <i>...but I'm like you,</i>
<i>I fell in love with that woman</i>

08:11.949 --> 08:16.538
<i>because she alone is trying
to help those kids succeed in life.</i>

08:16.621 --> 08:18.474
<i>A lot of those kids came
from horrible backgrounds,</i>

08:18.498 --> 08:19.808
<i>- horrible family lives.</i>
- [players beatboxing]

08:19.832 --> 08:21.185
<i>She's trying to give them a chance.</i>

08:21.209 --> 08:22.228
- [host 1] <i>I was shocked...</i>
- [Wagner] Shut up.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.354
<i>At how much empathy
she had for everyone.</i>

08:23.378 --> 08:24.212
- [host 2] <i>I agree.</i>
- [Wagner] Shh!

08:24.296 --> 08:25.523
- [host 1] <i>You like her?</i>
- [host 2] <i>Yes.</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:29.384
- Sure.
<i>- I think a little smitten.</i>

08:29.467 --> 08:30.510
Okay. Okay.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.719
[host 3] <i>Speaking of which,</i>

08:31.803 --> 08:33.888

- [host 1 laughs]
- [host 3] <i>Yeah.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:37.275
[host 1] <i>Hello, Brittany Wagner.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:38.768
I'm good. How are you?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.395
<i>That is her. I can tell by the voice.</i>

08:40.478 --> 08:41.664
- [chuckles]
<i>- You were listening.</i>

08:41.688 --> 08:43.489
<i>Do you think
it's gonna be different this year</i>

08:43.565 --> 08:47.110
<i>now that you know what's going on
and you've seen how it ends up on TV?</i>

08:47.194 --> 08:50.072
Let me ask the guys. Do y'all think
it's gonna be different this year

08:50.155 --> 08:51.323
knowing that we... What's...

08:51.406 --> 08:53.908
That this is all going to be on TV
and how it's gonna...

08:53.991 --> 08:56.661
- That it's a big show.
- [all speaking]

08:56.744 --> 08:58.621
They say no. They're the same people.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.985
- We still gotta grind.
- [Wagner] It's gonna be the same.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.185
- Here for two reasons...
- [Wagner] That's enough.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.086
[host 1] <i>There you go. Well, thank you.</i>

09:04.169 --> 09:06.879
<i>I hope you and the guys
will sit and finish the show as well.</i>

09:06.963 --> 09:09.216
Yeah, we will
until they have to go to class.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.939
<i>All right. Good deal.
Thank you very much.</i>

09:11.008 --> 09:13.845
<i>- We appreciate it.</i>
- Thank you, guys. Bye.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.433
- [Wagner] Hi!
- Hey.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.393
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.563
[Wagner] Okay, you gotta sign that.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.023
That was your semester GPA.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.944
Um, so you're on track for December.
Shouldn't be an issue.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.197
We just gotta pass that math class.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.906
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

09:33.990 --> 09:34.907
[Wagner] Good. What's your name?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.701
- Kamonte Carter.
- Okay.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.621
Are you in culture shock?

09:40.872 --> 09:42.123
[both chuckling]

09:42.207 --> 09:43.249
[Wagner] No?

09:43.333 --> 09:46.711
So, um, we'll do your schedule
in the morning,

09:46.794 --> 09:50.715
just, you know, whatever we've gotta do
to get out in December, okay?

09:50.798 --> 09:53.152
- We'll figure it out.
- So will you call me on his schedule?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.262
- Ma'am?
- Will you call me on his schedule?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.930
He doesn't make them decisions.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.042
- [Wagner] I'll handle it.
- Okay.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.284
[Wagner] I won't leave it up to him.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.120

- [Rivers] He doesn't.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.980

just based on what we've got to do

10:06.063 --> 10:08.316
to get him out in December
and keep him D-I eligible.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.528
Tomorrow night,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.172
you're gonna go to class, have tutoring...

10:13.196 --> 10:14.715
Your friends are here,
you're gonna have football,

10:14.739 --> 10:17.050
you're gonna go to dinner,
and you're gonna be sitting in dinner.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.136
You're gonna be chilling, hanging out,

10:18.160 --> 10:20.870
and then you're gonna forget
about this class.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.622
You know I'm gonna cut up at dinner.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.750
You've got to remember
that you have this class at 9:00.

10:25.833 --> 10:26.709
- All right.
- 'Cause you miss it,

10:26.793 --> 10:27.793
you're gonna get dropped.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.215
You have no more leeway.
My magic wand has already been waved.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.967
So there's no more fairy dust.
There's no more magic.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.220
It's now on Isaiah Wright to get it done.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.055
All right. But I ain't worried about it.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.349
[Wagner] You're still here.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.976

- [Isaiah] Okay.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.521
'Cause these offers

than it went last year.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.919

11:14.090 --> 11:16.259

A serenity song this morning.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.650
Oh, man, it was real difficult
to watch the documentary.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.236
You know, I sat back
and I watched it, and I go...

12:16.778 --> 12:19.489

That guy's not a good guy.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.699
He's not a good coach.

Ooh-whee, his language is bad."

12:25.287 --> 12:27.289
I met a couple in the store one day.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.791
Older couple, probably in their late 70s,

12:29.874 --> 12:32.960
and guy comes up to me
and introduces himself

12:33.044 --> 12:35.755
and his wife is standing there
and just,

12:35.838 --> 12:38.341
hey, how much they enjoyed
the documentary.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.845
And I caught myself looking over at her
and saying, "I'm just... I'm so sorry.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.933
[chuckles] I'm so sorry for what I said
and how I acted, and, uh...

12:47.016 --> 12:49.185

12:49.269 --> 12:51.229
And she said, "Coach...

but nobody wants to see how it's made."

12:56.859 --> 12:59.404

And that's kind of stuck with me.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.865

[Tooney Hill] I really like Buddy.
I like his way of coaching.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.725
To be the best at whatever you do...

13:30.059 --> 13:31.561
you got to be different.

and, I mean, I'm not blind to the fact
that kind of stuff doesn't happen,

14:00.089 --> 14:01.716
but this was just overwhelming to me,

14:01.799 --> 14:05.928

through another season like that,

14:13.269 --> 14:14.311
and did not change,

14:14.396 --> 14:16.481

Buddy's also seeing some change

14:55.227 --> 14:57.814
in how maybe he deals
with people around him,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.774

for one game last year, the playoff game.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.401

of course, which will be the Jones game.

Don't joke around about not being
a big deal. It's a huge deal.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.823

with how you act today.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.813

19:59.741 --> 20:00.825

but a national championship.

[Isaiah] It's dumb.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.966
'Cause we only got...

20:18.425 --> 20:21.262
I think, three D-linemen,
you understand.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.224
And not enough offensive linemen.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.852
My very first game out of my whole life

20:27.935 --> 20:31.522
not playin' in, not startin',
not even be able to touch the field.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.816
So it hit me, it hit me pretty deep.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.361
They took it from us last year,
off some fugazi stuff.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.947
<i>But, hey, it happened.
What happened, happened.</i>

20:40.031 --> 20:41.866
We're just gonna fight
extra hard this year

20:41.949 --> 20:44.326
to get what we was supposed to earn
last year.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.586
[De'Andre] <i>I was like,</i>
<i>"I'm suspended too?"</i>

20:54.670 --> 20:57.631
I wasn't even on the team,
I wasn't even on the roster last year.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.216
So then why am I suspended?

20:59.300 --> 21:02.594
I accepted it.
And, you know, nothin' I can do about it.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.556
<i>It's been two years since I played,
you know.</i>

21:05.639 --> 21:07.391
Adversity after adversity.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.685
It's like the devil keep coming at me.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.564
<i>You know, but...</i>
[scoffs] <i>I'm cheering on Vijay.</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:15.900
"Come on, Vijay. Pull this...
You know what I'm sayin'?

21:15.983 --> 21:18.694
Pull this team together.
Get this win for us."

21:18.778 --> 21:19.987
On the ball, the ball!

21:20.071 --> 21:21.551
What's the play? Y'all know the play?

21:21.613 --> 21:24.533
Go on the ball! Let's go! Get on the ball!
Get up on the ball!

21:25.117 --> 21:27.829
Line up, line up!
Clock's running! Let's go, let's go!

21:27.912 --> 21:29.789
Come on, man!

21:29.872 --> 21:32.666
- You two were last! Danny, let's go!
- Get that thing out your ass!

21:32.749 --> 21:35.145
[Trickett] <i>De'Andre knows he's the leader.</i>
<i>He's a quarterback.</i>

21:35.169 --> 21:36.545
<i>They're all looking at him,</i>

21:36.628 --> 21:38.630
takes that mentality
in everything he does.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.468
<i>Vijay is more of a project.
We think we have him mentally prepared.</i>

21:42.551 --> 21:45.805
<i>He went against our first D last night,
and he did pretty dang good.</i>

21:45.888 --> 21:49.851
That's fine. I can live with that.
I can live with that.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.477
[Wood] <i>Vijay wanted to compete.</i>

21:51.560 --> 21:53.062
<i>Some people get scared off by that.</i>

21:53.145 --> 21:54.331
<i>"I heard you got
a Division I quarterback."</i>

21:54.355 --> 21:55.755
He never really worried about that,

21:55.815 --> 21:58.985
he was really focused on coming
and wanting to compete for the job.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.829
And I think he's done
a marvelous job of that

22:00.903 --> 22:01.946
as an incoming freshman.

22:02.029 --> 22:05.157
<i>If we can keep it simple for him
in keepin' it where it's controlled,</i>

22:05.241 --> 22:07.243
<i>where he's only got
one or two things to read,</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:08.327
<i>then he should do well.</i>

22:08.410 --> 22:10.579
[Trickett] We're better
than what we were on Saturday.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.975
Let's keep building off of that.
We're not where we need to be.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.392
Let's keep building off of that
so we can get

22:14.416 --> 22:15.560
where you need to be next week,

22:15.584 --> 22:17.062
and where you need to be
the week after that.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.505
And you keep doing what you're doing.
All right? Good?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.048
Qs on three. One, two, three...

22:21.132 --> 22:22.216
[all] Qs.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.844
[Wood] Backside of that thing is a slant.
It's not a stick.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.137
Gotta make sure I see that.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.055
You guys, you gotta know that stuff.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.182
You can't just wait. Gotta know it.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.267
Vijay.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.851
[Wood] Can't do that. Can't do that.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.603
Jones has got some good edge players.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.607
You're gonna have to do
a great job blocking 'em.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.316
[Buddy] <i>You're gonna be in charge</i>
<i>of the O-line, okay?</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:41.027
I've pared everything down

22:41.110 --> 22:43.779
to things I think everybody's
gonna be able to run really well.

22:43.862 --> 22:47.033
We've changed some protections
to protect you a little bit longer.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.993
But the thing I don't want you to do

22:49.076 --> 22:51.578
is I don't want you to prolong the play
and you take a hit.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.290
Just take it and run,
get us a first down, get down.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.893
You're gonna be like
that Clemson quarterback

22:55.917 --> 22:57.626
at the end of that Alabama game.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.671
You're gonna be wore out, okay?
You're gonna be tired.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.132
'Cause this is gonna be...
It's gonna be your game.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.634
[Vijay] <i>We're missing half our team, so...</i>

23:05.717 --> 23:07.970
<i>I'm just ready to show
the coaches what I got,</i>

23:08.054 --> 23:11.057
<i>and what I can bring to the table
so that I won't get overlooked.</i>

23:11.140 --> 23:13.475
I didn't play football
till about sixth grade.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.228
I was playing baseball.
That's where it really all started at.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.565
<i>I threw harder than almost everybody.
The fastest I ever thrown was 93.</i>

23:19.648 --> 23:23.402
So I was like, "Okay, might as well
try football and be a quarterback."

23:23.485 --> 23:26.405
I ain't get no, uh,
D-I offer or anything like that.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.781
It was mainly all JUCO.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.202
I thought I was better.
Well, I know I'm better than that.

23:31.285 --> 23:34.580
So I just came to East Mississippi
'cause I know they get people out.

23:46.925 --> 23:47.926
[Wagner] Tim...

23:48.802 --> 23:49.971
are you logged in yet?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.513
- [chuckles]
- Tim?

23:51.597 --> 23:53.474
- [student] Hey, Miss...
- We're good.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.975
What are you working on?

23:55.059 --> 23:56.560
History. I mean, English.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.480
I took my college English last year,
so I ain't gotta do it this year.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.483
[sighs] I took it this summer.
It didn't come out right.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.735
Tim, are you logged in yet?

24:04.818 --> 24:06.320
[Tim] I'm turning the computer on.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.197
Oh, my God! [chuckles]

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
Are you on yet?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.700
[Tim] You know your computer's slow.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.536
Well, you talked to Mitch
for ten minutes before.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.747
Look, I've been waiting for it to load up.

24:16.830 --> 24:20.876
- Do you have, um, notes?
- Mm-mm.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.545
You've gotta start taking notes
in this class.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.629
All right.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.009
- Do you have a notebook?
- Nope. [sighs]

24:28.092 --> 24:30.302
[Wagner] <i>Okay, we're gonna make</i>
<i>a notebook right now.</i>

24:30.969 --> 24:33.305
And then next week,
you're gonna have the notebook

24:33.389 --> 24:34.532
and it's gonna be full of notes.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.308
[Tim] Mm-hmm-hmm...

24:36.392 --> 24:38.102
- Yes?
- Yeah, I heard you.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.396
I just need me some rest.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.730
Go home and lay down and rest.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.857
[Wagner] Come in here,
we're gonna make a notebook.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.110
[clicks tongue and sighs]

24:47.403 --> 24:48.987
[Wagner] You want one with a penguin?

24:49.071 --> 24:51.823
- What are your classes?
- [Tim grunts]

24:51.907 --> 24:54.743
Miss Mullins for human and...
develop growth.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.871
And, um, Ms. Castleberry for, uh...

24:58.997 --> 25:00.207
Just put Castleberry.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.834
It was like a, uh...

25:02.918 --> 25:03.918
[unzipping]

25:05.796 --> 25:07.881
- [Wagner] Tim?
- [Tim] What up?

25:07.964 --> 25:10.592
- [Wagner] What is this?
- [chuckles]

25:10.676 --> 25:13.970
Tim, this is a mess.
I need you to do better.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.349
<i>I don't know a whole lot about him.</i>

25:17.433 --> 25:21.562
<i>Went to Louisville out of high school
and then came here from Louisville.</i>

25:21.645 --> 25:24.315
<i>I think he is a sweet, sweet guy.</i>

25:24.398 --> 25:28.527
But sometimes, when I ask him something,
I have to say it, like, three times

25:28.610 --> 25:32.448
because he's just... not even...

25:32.531 --> 25:35.784
It's like he's not even aware
of where he is and what he's doing.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.829
Okay, next week, we're knockin' out
all of our homework...

25:38.912 --> 25:40.206
- Listen to me.
- I hear you.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.291
Look at me.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.003
It's turned all the way up.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.299
[chuckles] Look, okay? [stammers]

25:51.300 --> 25:52.384
See?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.970
[chuckles] Next week,
we're doing all the home...

25:55.053 --> 25:57.181
Look at me and focus on what I'm saying.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.076
Yeah, I'mma get the homework,
notes, and everything.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.119
Next week, we're doing
all the homework and quizzes for math,

26:01.143 --> 26:05.439
and I want all... [stammers]
The three history quizzes done.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.523
All right.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.444
I heard you, Miss Brittany, I promise you.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.321
Now I need to get water. I'm thirsty.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.324
I been here... held hostage.
Like I'm in a jail.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.742
[Wagner laughing]

26:19.995 --> 26:21.122
Oh... [sighs]

26:27.085 --> 26:28.920
What's going on, man?
How you doing today?

26:30.464 --> 26:32.508
[Tim] <i>I was at</i>
<i>the University of Louisville,</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:33.842
<i>but I had got into trouble.</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:34.926
Uh...

26:36.345 --> 26:38.139
It's a long story, but...

26:38.764 --> 26:41.558
Somebody had said
I had a gun in my dorm, so...

26:42.226 --> 26:44.603
they checked my room,
but they ain't find no gun.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.897
[stammers] <i>I had a meeting</i>
<i>with the student dean.</i>

26:46.980 --> 26:49.358
<i>Went over and, um, she said...</i>

26:50.359 --> 26:52.379
"She don't feel comfortable
about you on the campus, so...

26:52.403 --> 26:54.530
you can stay and get charged
or leave and go home."

26:55.197 --> 26:58.037
So I packed my stuff the same day,
got on a bus, and went to Birmingham.

26:58.367 --> 27:02.371
I need to keep going, 'cause in my family,
I'm the first one to make it.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.474
I had a lot of brothers play basketball
and football,

27:04.498 --> 27:06.375
and they ain't too much make it, so...

27:06.458 --> 27:07.538
they dropped out of school.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.171
So they were on me tough
to keep me motivated a lot,

27:10.254 --> 27:12.005
and tell me to keep on pushing myself.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.764
[Buddy] All right, guys,
we got a huge problem.

27:20.847 --> 27:25.186
This is supposedly our guy
that we're gonna start at guard.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.270
First game.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.522
And he can't do it.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.108
Watch. And this one's even worse. Okay?

27:32.192 --> 27:35.821
He's the backup to the backup.
That guy can't play.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.698
We're bad at this right now.

27:38.199 --> 27:42.160
So many freshmen that have no clue.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.957
That, right there?
That, right there, is just mental.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.919
This is the mentality
that we have right now as a team.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.002
That, right there.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.300
They're not very coachable right now.
I don't know what it is.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.261
So what do we do?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.138
- What do we do?
- Keep working.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.683
Don't get frustrated over one deal.
Just keep grinding.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.453
- We gotta keep going.
- [Buddy] But this is everyday deal.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.062
- Well, but I mean...
- [Buddy] This ain't a one-day deal.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.940
We've not blocked, and that's...
This is my responsibility.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.401
[Wood stammers]
I have to do it every day, I get it.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.069
- It is an everyday deal.
- [sighs]

28:16.653 --> 28:17.654
You gotta keep working.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.818
I don't think there's anything
other to do than that.

28:19.865 --> 28:24.870
But the problem is, right now,
our demeanor is not very good. Period.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.374
Young guys, do y'all want to use these?

28:28.915 --> 28:31.668
- In the first game? Huh?
- [player] I'll use it. It'll be faster.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.588
Okay, you okay to do that?
You gotta get it to... Can you read?

28:34.671 --> 28:35.732
- [player] Uh-huh.
- [all laugh]

28:35.756 --> 28:39.301
I mean, can you see that?
Is it too small?

28:39.385 --> 28:40.903
[player] No, we had that in high school.

28:40.927 --> 28:46.141
[Buddy] Get red, red, red, red,
red, red, red. No, red only.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.894
Red, I got six.
No, I got the six, dummy!

28:48.977 --> 28:50.687
Am I... am I speaking French?

28:50.771 --> 28:53.607
- I got number, you got color!
- Oh, we ain't communicate that.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.651
[Buddy] I'm gonna communicate it.
Here we go.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.695
Right, right, right, right, right,
right, right, right, right, right!

28:59.195 --> 29:00.876
That's how they gonna be in the game, too.

29:02.032 --> 29:06.370
Arguing, "No, dummy, your left hand."
"White."

29:06.453 --> 29:08.038
Here we go! Red.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.292
Eight! Eight!

29:12.417 --> 29:14.294
- Please don't hold 'em both up.
- I didn't.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.504
[Buddy] Eight. Red-Eight.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.716
Hey, dickhead here, he's gotta
figure out what we... [stutters]

29:19.800 --> 29:22.594
He can't hold up both arms
and go, "Take a guess."

29:22.678 --> 29:25.972
[stutters] It's right, it's right!
It ain't red, it ain't white, it's right!

29:26.056 --> 29:28.141
<i>I mean, it's... it's tough, man.</i>

29:28.224 --> 29:31.395
<i>It's just, uh...
you want 'em to get better so fast,</i>

29:31.478 --> 29:33.605
<i>and... and it takes a little time.</i>

29:33.689 --> 29:36.400
I want to blow up so bad,
and I just wanna...

29:36.483 --> 29:39.945
You know, I just wanna, uh,
let the expletives fly, you know.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.156
[stammers] But we're working
very hard to, uh...

29:43.239 --> 29:46.368
to make sure that, uh,
we do things the right way.

29:46.452 --> 29:50.497
[stammers] And, uh, it's very challenging.

29:50.581 --> 29:55.043
It really is, but, uh, you know, uh...
Lord's taking care of me today.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.172
Hey, Snoop. Get down, man.
Head up, son.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.466
Let's go!

30:01.216 --> 30:03.510
Ready. Let's go!

30:04.470 --> 30:06.054
There you go. Good, good, good.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.724
Hey, your ass can't get
knocked off the ball now.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.351
You understand?

30:10.434 --> 30:14.980
Son, you gonna have to help us play.
You gonna have to. You gonna have to.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.233
Stop practicing
so doggone lackadaisical now.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.485
Come off the doggone ball.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.278
[indistinct chatter]

30:23.071 --> 30:25.240
You playin' bad.
You might not want it bad.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.783
[player] Hey, I got you.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.454
- It's 180 degrees out here.
- [player] Yeah, man.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.955
They frying the hell out of me.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.250
[sniffing]

30:35.334 --> 30:38.128
Hey, dude, yeah, what you do when,
uh, on the... from the...

30:38.211 --> 30:39.755
Like, they pull you down?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.273
[player] It should be illegal
to look this good...

30:41.297 --> 30:43.925
- You don't let 'em pull you down.
- Shit, I was trying not to.

30:44.593 --> 30:45.802
You bullshittin'.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.763
- Who?
- You.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.182
You've been out here too long
not to know this here call.

30:50.474 --> 30:53.477
I'm not learning the way I should be,

30:54.060 --> 30:58.314
'cause, I'm basically not...
I'm stressin' about the first game.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.402
<i>I gotta play, I mean, it ain't
that you may, you may not play,</i>

31:01.485 --> 31:03.820
I mean, you gonna... I have to play.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.114
And I mean, I don't wanna get embarrassed,

31:06.198 --> 31:09.117
I don't wanna embarrass my team
by not knowing what to do.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.121
[stammers] It's a lot of nervousness
coming in behind that.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.016
We gotta pick this up.
Practice has been horrible.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.167
We gotta pick it up.
We got new stuff going in.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.461
And I need y'all
to be ready to soak it in.

31:20.421 --> 31:21.672
- You got me?
- Yes, sir.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.174
Okay, and y'all need to get
on them damn freshmen's ass there

31:24.257 --> 31:25.592
and to get they ass going, okay?

31:25.676 --> 31:26.760
Seriously now.

31:27.343 --> 31:30.389
[Chauncey] <i>Yo, are you absolutely</i>
<i>trying your hardest at practice?</i>

31:30.472 --> 31:31.515
[De'Andre] Hell no.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.974
He know he ain't getting cut.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.727
- He know he ain't getting cut.
- [Snoop] I mean...

31:35.811 --> 31:38.605
I just don't like going hard in practice.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.483
Like, when I was in ninth grade,
I went hard.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.693
I was going hard every...

31:42.776 --> 31:44.376
The whole spring, 'cause I was starting.

31:44.695 --> 31:48.239
And I hurt one of our offensive linemen,
who had a lot of scholarship offers.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.660
And he wind up got hurt
and lost all his scholarships.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.036
Now he in Canton, smoking dope.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.760
[Chauncey] You know this not high school.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.040
[Snoop] I mean,
I don't wanna hurt nobody, bro.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.167
- This is college. [chuckles]
- [Snoop] All right.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.086
You gotta understand, bro.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.922
You ain't gonna play, bro,
if you don't do stuff in practice.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.165
This ain't high school,
you could just play on Fridays.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.300
Play on Saturdays.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.011
- [Snoop] I gotcha.
- Nah, you ain't got it.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.782
You been saying that shit for four weeks,
and you still be bullshittin'.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.446
[Wagner] Okay, I e-mailed him about that.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.184
I'm telling you,
you ain't gonna play, bro.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.829
You think Coach bullshittin'
when he said that,

32:17.853 --> 32:19.270
like, not to put you in the game?

32:19.354 --> 32:20.939
Snoop, enjoy your time here.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.359
When you come from D-I,
and you all the way up here,

32:24.443 --> 32:26.445
like, people treat you, like, so good,

32:26.528 --> 32:29.823
and, like, when you come down to JUCO,
it's like starting over.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.577
I look at myself, like, "Damn, like,
I had it good, but I lost it all."

32:33.660 --> 32:34.661
How old you is?

32:34.745 --> 32:37.205
[Chauncey] I'm 19.
I'm trying to make a mil before I'm 23.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.499
I'm trying to be rich.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.210
I'm gonna be 21.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.631
- [Chauncey] You retarded. It's a wrap.
- [both laugh]

32:47.132 --> 32:48.592
[Chauncey] It's a wrap.

32:49.551 --> 32:52.554
When I chose to come here,
like, Coach, he drove to Atlanta,

32:53.054 --> 32:55.766
and he came and met with my mom
and me and my brother,

32:55.849 --> 32:57.559
and, uh, he was telling me about Kam.

32:58.519 --> 33:02.022
[stammers] We got in trouble
for the same reasons.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.899
That's why they wanted us
in the same room,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.441
you know? To help each other out.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.944
That's crazy, 'cause we actually played...

33:08.028 --> 33:11.322
[stutters] We played each other's school
in the bowl game last year.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.367
<i>That's crazy, and now we roommates.</i>

33:14.451 --> 33:15.994
[Chauncey] <i>If you look in the media,</i>

33:16.077 --> 33:17.662
<i>my name's... You know what I'm saying?</i>

33:17.746 --> 33:19.873
<i>Just a person who does bad things.</i>

33:19.956 --> 33:23.001
A person who just
doesn't make great decisions.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.170
At the end of the day,
I got something to prove,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.088
you know what I'm saying?
To get back on top.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.383
You know, I have little brothers
and sisters and stuff like that.

33:30.466 --> 33:33.804
And he looked my name up in class
to show his friends.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.848
The first thing that came up
is I got kicked out of Penn State.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.267
<i>And, I mean,
he called me crying that night.</i>

33:40.393 --> 33:43.772
It took me hearing
that it hurt somebody else,

33:43.855 --> 33:47.609
me getting kicked out, for, you know,
it to come back and hurt me.

33:50.361 --> 33:55.742
We got five D-linemen for the first game,
and we got... [chuckles]

33:55.826 --> 33:58.579
and we pretty much sure that
we're gonna have to play every snap.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.581
I'm ready, but you know what I'm sayin'?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.892
- [Kam] You don't know what to expect.
- I don't know what to expect.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.876
I mean, just thinking about, you know,

34:04.960 --> 34:08.504
[chuckles] not getting a break till
the first quarter's over, is like, dang.

34:08.589 --> 34:12.008
It's a difference between in shape
and actually in shape.

34:12.676 --> 34:13.677
[indistinct chatter]

34:15.303 --> 34:17.556
Whoo! It's a hot one.

34:18.682 --> 34:19.891
[Williams] Ready!

34:20.851 --> 34:22.936
- Go!
- [grunting and panting]

34:25.230 --> 34:30.193
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

34:30.276 --> 34:35.156
five, four, three, two, one!

34:35.824 --> 34:37.492
[coach] Hey, how many are you runnin'?

34:37.576 --> 34:40.245
[Williams] Until they make time.
They just missed the first one.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.539
- [panting]
- [Williams] Guys, 20 seconds is not hard.

34:43.624 --> 34:47.127
Let's go, helmets on,
get back to the line. Let's go. Ready!

34:47.210 --> 34:49.272
- [player] Come on. Let's ride.
- [Chauncey] Let's go, Kam.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.381
Put your hand down, Kam. Come on.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.464
[Williams] Go!

34:53.550 --> 34:54.593
Go!

34:55.093 --> 34:56.762
- Go! Go!
- [grunting]

34:56.845 --> 34:58.322
- [grunting]
- [player 1] Let's go, Snoop!

34:58.346 --> 34:59.598
[player 2] Catch up, Snoop!

34:59.681 --> 35:03.268
[Williams] Three, two, one!

35:03.351 --> 35:05.145
See, that, that's that "quit" right there.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.230
I knew it was coming soon, that "quit."

35:07.313 --> 35:09.434
[Tim] You can make them keep running.
I'm makin' mine.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.901
- [man] Ain't no "them," man.
- Man, fuck all that.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.671
Ain't finna keep running
for a motherfucker

35:13.695 --> 35:14.797
that don't wanna make their time.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.907
[Williams] Stand up, Tim. Stand up!

35:16.990 --> 35:18.300
[player] We had a long-ass practice.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.044
- [Kam] This some dumb bullshit.
- [Williams] Don't say nothing else.

35:21.536 --> 35:22.746
Don't say nothing else.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.290
Ready. Go!

35:27.083 --> 35:32.088
Five, four, three, two, one.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.652
- [panting]
- [Williams] Everybody up.

35:35.676 --> 35:38.303
Yo, stand up. Hey, can we get
some water over here, please?

35:38.386 --> 35:39.470
Yes, there you go.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.222
[player] Appreciate it. I know, I know.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.725
[player 2] Wash it down, it's all good.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.730
- [Williams] Y'all all right?
- [Snoop] Yes, sir.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.022
- [Williams] Today was the last day...
- [Kam] Uh-uh. Get off me.

35:49.105 --> 35:52.025
Today was the last day. Okay?

35:52.108 --> 35:54.360
Of coming out here lackadaisical
and not focused.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.486
The last day.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.573
I got guys in this group
that's still out of shape.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.659
And I got guys in this group
that still ain't ready

36:01.284 --> 36:03.119
that we gonna be depending on.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.999
I got guys still in this group
that don't know what the hell to do,

36:08.083 --> 36:09.793
that we gonna be depending on!

36:11.044 --> 36:13.672
So, if you got a problem
with my approach to getting you ready,

36:13.755 --> 36:15.298
go play another position.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.136
You got me? Today was the last day, guys.
I mean it, okay?

36:21.847 --> 36:22.848
[Williams] Break it down.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.992
[player] D-line on me. D-line on three.
One, two, three!

36:25.016 --> 36:26.351
[all] D-line!

36:26.434 --> 36:28.434
- [player] Boot up.
- [Williams] Get off the field.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.063
[player] Whoo!

36:30.146 --> 36:32.315
[Williams] <i>Talent-wise, I'm not worried.</i>

36:32.398 --> 36:34.400
<i>We're a pretty good,
talented football team.</i>

36:34.484 --> 36:38.154
<i>But, you know,
we can only play so many plays,</i>

36:38.238 --> 36:41.116
<i>so the depth would be the one thing
that I'd be worried about</i>

36:41.199 --> 36:43.659
<i>just because of the freshmen
that has to play.</i>

36:43.744 --> 36:47.080
<i>You got young guys
that have to play immediately,</i>

36:47.163 --> 36:50.375
<i>not gonna baby 'em,
not gonna be their friend.</i>

36:50.458 --> 36:51.835
You know, I'm a hard-nosed coach.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.838
And when we're out on that field now,
you know, I gotta get 'em going.

36:57.799 --> 37:00.426
[Wagner] You can sit down in there
and do some homework. For math.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.738
[Snoop] Hey, Dakota. You good at math?

37:01.762 --> 37:03.429
Yeah. I can help you.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.723
[Wagner gasps] Yes!

37:04.806 --> 37:08.518
This dude has already passed, like,
calculus four.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.686
- [Chauncey] Damn!
- [chuckles] Calculus two, Miss B.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.456
- [Wagner] And you made an A.
- I don't know...

37:12.480 --> 37:13.314
[player] Hey!

37:13.398 --> 37:15.859
I wouldn't say I just like school.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.779
I just... I just know I need it.

37:18.862 --> 37:23.158
So I do put time...
I do put a lot of time into school.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.659
You need some help still?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.787
[Snoop] Yeah, I barely made it
out of high school.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.472
[Chauncey]
You qualified out of high school?

37:28.496 --> 37:29.998
No, I ain't qualified.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.935
[Chauncey] Damn. Why you say it like that?

37:32.959 --> 37:35.045
[chuckles] Because, man, I'm here.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.379
Oh, man...

37:36.462 --> 37:38.048
I ain't qualify nothin'.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.550
All right, why Mississippi like...

37:40.633 --> 37:41.927
They think like, okay,

37:42.010 --> 37:45.180
when they graduate high school,
there's JUCO, then foot, then college.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.266
- [Wagner] They don't.
- I swear to God, that's how they think.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.618
- All of these...
- [Wagner] Because they're not...

37:49.642 --> 37:52.645
- They know they're not gonna qualify.
- I think it's the school system.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.275
Very good thought. You're right.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.152
- [Chauncey] It's sad.
- It is sad. Very sad.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.880
[Chauncey] That is not
how you supposed to think.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.737
You're right.

38:01.822 --> 38:06.659
So then what you wanna do here is
you ask yourself what they have in common.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.580
They both have a X,
yeah, so you take it out.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.333
- That's the same as that.
- [Snoop] Oh. So...

38:13.416 --> 38:15.626
- See what I'm saying?
- All right, I see now.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.422
Three X plus two.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.301
[Wagner] <i>If you came in today</i>
<i>and said, "Dakota Allen,"</i>

38:23.384 --> 38:27.263
<i>and then told me what he had done,
I wouldn't believe you.</i>

38:27.848 --> 38:34.020
There's no way you could convince me
that that kid had an armed robbery charge.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.983
I literally wouldn't think
he could hurt a fly.

38:38.817 --> 38:43.112
He is the sweetest, most genuine...
smart, like...

38:43.989 --> 38:47.826
the whole package.
Whole-package kid to me.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.926
[Buddy] Here we go. Here we go.
Red-Seven. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.052
[whistle blows]

39:06.135 --> 39:10.014
Walter, we're going against air.
We gotta get a snap!

39:12.517 --> 39:15.270
Quit feeling sorry for yourselves
and thinking that it's hot.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.231
Get the dadgum snap.
Snap's the easiest thing in the world.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.108
Get the snap! All right?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.403
And, hey, move around a little bit,
have some urgency!

39:23.486 --> 39:26.614
We got a day that we got to get better!
And we're not getting better!

39:27.698 --> 39:29.426
Don't get better how...
I'm gonna tell you something.

39:29.450 --> 39:33.038
You will get skull-drug in the first game.
You will get skull-drug!

39:34.122 --> 39:37.625
Every day you gotta get better!
Every single day!

39:37.708 --> 39:39.127
Now, I mean what I'm saying!

39:39.210 --> 39:41.837
Some of you are sitting around
and you ain't taking it serious!

39:41.922 --> 39:45.967
If you don't pick it up,
you will get your rear end drug out.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.429
Unless you're working,
and don't pretend to be working. Work!

39:50.180 --> 39:51.222
There's a difference!

39:51.932 --> 39:53.433
De'Andre, lead your team.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.061
[De'Andre] Whose Father?

39:56.144 --> 39:58.205
[all] Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.582
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.709
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

40:02.733 --> 40:03.835
as we forgive our trespassers.

40:03.859 --> 40:06.988
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

40:07.072 --> 40:09.074
[Buddy] Let's go.
Break it down! Hurry! Let's go!

40:10.241 --> 40:12.827
Anything else? Look at it
and see if I need to change it.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.271
- I'm gonna adjust it.
- [Buddy] Uh, no, I think we're fine.

40:15.621 --> 40:18.624
We play against the best
every day in this league.

40:18.708 --> 40:23.296
And most people fear EMCC,
and we practice every day against EMCC.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.716
So, I mean, it's just another day
at the playground,

40:26.799 --> 40:29.010

done killed us way worse

Here's what I'm gonna do
first play of the game, seven yards out...

40:52.117 --> 40:54.995

then I'm gonna square his ass up.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.372
- [player 1] Square him up?
- [player 2 screams]

40:57.455 --> 40:59.915

- [player] A wrap. Crazy ass.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.543
[Wood] Anybody got any questions
on anything that they've got?

41:02.627 --> 41:04.337
Coach has got
two call sheets on the front.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.481
You gotta be smart enough that

41:05.505 --> 41:07.306
if you hear something
that doesn't seem right,

41:07.340 --> 41:10.468
if something doesn't sound right,
look at him, and ask him to re-run it.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.595
Just tell him, "What?"
Ask him to re-run it.

41:12.678 --> 41:16.516

play fast, get after 'em.

We go! Let's go! It's over, it's over.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.062
[Kam] Hey, Tim!

49:00.145 --> 49:02.397
[crowd cheering and yelling]

49:02.482 --> 49:05.192
That's us, right there.
Score this, motherfuckers!

49:05.275 --> 49:08.403
[Winfield] <i>A golden opportunity,</i>
<i>a chance to add to a touchdown lead.</i>

49:08.488 --> 49:10.239
<i>Let's see if the Lions can take advantage.</i>

49:10.322 --> 49:12.908
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap to Miller,</i>
<i>Miller fakes the give,</i>

49:12.992 --> 49:14.970
<i>has pressure up the middle, he's hit.
He's gonna be drug down.</i>

49:14.994 --> 49:16.179
<i>Vijay Miller's gonna be sacked.</i>

49:16.203 --> 49:18.581
[Winfield] <i>Right up the middle that time,</i>
<i>untouched.</i>

49:18.664 --> 49:22.126
What are you doing?
Hey, you're standing right here!

49:22.209 --> 49:23.544
Get the signal!

49:23.627 --> 49:26.439
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap to Miller.</i>
<i>Miller is gonna fire over to the far side.</i>

49:26.463 --> 49:28.149
<i>It goes off the hands
of the intended receiver</i>

49:28.173 --> 49:30.050
<i>- at the 22-yard line...</i>
- Ball, ball!

49:30.134 --> 49:31.319
[Crowder] <i>...in the backfield.</i>

49:31.343 --> 49:34.429
[Buddy] You can't do that.
You gotta be a man and catch it.

49:34.514 --> 49:37.642
[Crowder] <i>And that's gonna bring up</i>
<i>now a third-down situation for EMCC.</i>

49:37.725 --> 49:39.495
<i>- And it's gonna be a huge sack.</i>
- [whistle blowing]

49:39.519 --> 49:40.603
[Buddy] What're you doing?

49:40.686 --> 49:42.455
[Crowder]
<i>So that's going to be a huge loss...</i>

49:42.479 --> 49:45.065
[Buddy] What are you doing?
Block! What are you doing?

49:45.149 --> 49:46.859
Wake up!

49:46.942 --> 49:50.320
[Buddy] The defense is playing great
and y'all are letting 'em have it.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.489
Why are you going up to the linebacker?

49:52.573 --> 49:54.449
You're not thinking, and then you get beat

49:54.534 --> 49:56.661
and you just get pushed back
into the quarterback.

49:56.744 --> 49:59.872
Hey, you... Hey, listen to me.
Look at me, look at me.

49:59.955 --> 50:03.668
You either pick it up
and you start playing like a champion

50:03.751 --> 50:05.711
or you won't play after this week.

50:05.794 --> 50:09.173
When times are tough, you gotta focus.
It's physical!

50:09.674 --> 50:13.052
You gotta come on and play.
You can't... You can't sit around.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.930
Move, please. You can't sit around.
You gotta come on.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.057
You gotta come off the ball. All right?

50:18.140 --> 50:19.951
You gotta run the play
the way it's supposed to!

50:19.975 --> 50:23.395
You gotta quit being soft.
You gotta quit being soft!

50:26.065 --> 50:28.234
We'll win. We'll win if y'all will block.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.154
- [buzzer sounds]
- That's it.

50:32.237 --> 50:35.365
Let's go, let's go, let's go, guys!
Let's go, let's go.

50:35.449 --> 50:38.994
[Crowder] <i>So an interception</i>
<i>and fumble recoveries for EMCC</i>

50:39.078 --> 50:41.706
<i>here in this first half
have given them a ten-point lead.</i>

50:41.789 --> 50:43.415
<i>We'll get Buddy Stephens' thoughts.</i>

50:43.498 --> 50:44.875
<i>I'd say he has to be pleased.</i>

50:44.959 --> 50:47.502
Coach, first half, all these freshmen,
what do you think?

50:47.587 --> 50:49.797
Uh, you know,
we're making a lot of mistakes mentally.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.925
[stutters] I mean,
we're not recognizing formations.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.736
We're not getting the calls
from the sideline.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.597
We're, uh, you know,
missing assignments on offense.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.891
Um, you know, we're not...
we're not executing real well at all.

51:00.975 --> 51:03.227
We're not, you know...
we're not maintaining blocks.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.020
Um, uh, yeah, I don't know...

51:05.104 --> 51:07.356
I honestly...
There's a lot more you could go over.

51:07.439 --> 51:10.000
I don't know if you have a...
If this is a 30-minute show or not.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.111
Um, our guys are playing hard.

51:12.194 --> 51:14.529
<i>We just have to play a lot smarter
on offense right now.</i>

51:14.614 --> 51:16.406
<i>And, uh, just keep
everything in front of us.</i>

51:16.490 --> 51:19.660
Hey, let me tell you something.
Playing a heck of a good football game.

51:19.744 --> 51:22.287
I told you, we're gonna shock the world.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.140
Nobody thinks
you're gonna be able to come here

51:24.164 --> 51:27.501
[stammers] and beat...
A team of 30, beat a team of 55.

51:27.584 --> 51:32.089
Nobody thinks that, but you should be up
by dadgum 25 right now.

51:32.172 --> 51:35.926
You're better than them.
You just keep playing like that, okay?

51:36.010 --> 51:38.137
And O-line, you gotta pick it up,

51:38.220 --> 51:41.724
or you're gonna be looking at everybody
when the game's over with, going,

51:41.807 --> 51:42.933
"I'm sorry."

51:43.433 --> 51:45.102
You can't do that!

51:45.978 --> 51:47.688
You gotta get in behind your pads,

51:47.772 --> 51:49.690
come off and knock the piss
out of somebody.

51:49.774 --> 51:53.318
No, "What if" or "What, hey..."
[imitating player grumbling]

51:53.402 --> 51:54.402
No!

51:55.112 --> 51:58.908
Get down, come off, and knock
the crap out of somebody. You got me?

51:58.991 --> 52:01.201
Let's go, let's get after...
Hey, keep working.

52:01.285 --> 52:05.122
Just keep working.
You're doing a heck of a job, D.

52:05.205 --> 52:09.334
[Ed Holly] I need 40 plays.
Forty plays. We need 40 plays.

52:09.418 --> 52:12.004
So in the fourth quarter,
we're the strongest.

52:12.087 --> 52:15.090
Can we hold up for 40 more plays?
That's the question.

52:15.174 --> 52:17.301
[trainer] <i>With the heat</i>
<i>and our reduced numbers,</i>

52:17.384 --> 52:20.054
we're expecting guys to have
a little bit of trouble with cramping,

52:20.137 --> 52:22.639
so the pickle juice has got
a lot of electrolytes in it.

52:22.723 --> 52:24.433
It's the best thing for cramps.

52:24.516 --> 52:25.994
- [player] Good shit, defense!
- Keep competing!

52:26.018 --> 52:27.138
[coach] Come on, D, step up!

52:27.186 --> 52:29.980
[snarling and growling]

52:31.857 --> 52:35.736
[continues snarling and growling]

52:37.697 --> 52:38.989
Watch the ball!

52:39.073 --> 52:40.950
[Crowder] <i>EMCC clinging</i>
<i>to the ten-point lead,</i>

52:41.033 --> 52:43.869
<i>13-3 with 11:40 to go
here in this third quarter.</i>

52:43.953 --> 52:48.248
<i>Jones knocking on the end zone door and...
there's the zone read.</i>

52:48.332 --> 52:51.460
<i>Quarterback keeper, inside the ten,
inside the five, touchdown.</i>

52:51.543 --> 52:55.589
<i>A 17-yard touchdown run,
and that's the first touchdown for Jones.</i>

52:55.672 --> 52:57.632
<i>They make it a three-point game.</i>

52:57.717 --> 52:59.468
Man. Let's go, D!

52:59.551 --> 53:02.304
[Buddy] Hey, listen, you hear that?
That's us not executing.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.472
Listen to me now,

53:03.555 --> 53:06.284
when you go home, you're gonna have
yourself to look at in the mirror.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.435
Time to make plays, kickoff return!

53:08.518 --> 53:10.229
[Tim] It's not my fucking fault.

53:10.980 --> 53:11.981
The fuck?

53:12.064 --> 53:13.875
[Crowder] <i>Ball on the right hash,</i>
<i>moving right to left.</i>

53:13.899 --> 53:16.443
<i>Miller, with the snap, back to pass,
pocket collapses.</i>

53:16.526 --> 53:18.738
<i>Tripped up as he was trying to go
to the right side.</i>

53:18.821 --> 53:21.406
<i>He's gonna be dropped inside the 25.</i>

53:21.490 --> 53:24.618
<i>And so EMCC is gonna have to punt away
from their own 23-yard line.</i>

53:24.701 --> 53:26.328
Come on, defense!

53:27.872 --> 53:29.164
Get the ball!

53:29.248 --> 53:31.166
[Crowder]
<i>On the snap, pocket collapses.</i>

53:31.250 --> 53:32.960
<i>He dumps it underneath and it's caught.</i>

53:33.043 --> 53:36.130
<i>Inside the 15, inside the ten,
inside the five, staying on his feet,</i>

53:36.213 --> 53:37.422
<i>and it's a touchdown.</i>

53:37.506 --> 53:39.800
<i>And Jones is taking
their first lead of the game,</i>

53:39.884 --> 53:41.301
<i>3:49 to go in the third quarter.</i>

53:41.385 --> 53:43.220

[Buddy] <i>Shit.</i>

- [yelling indistinctly]
- [Buddy] Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

53:51.896 --> 53:54.106
[coach] You gotta look to the sideline!

53:54.189 --> 53:56.776
That's 'cause you tired
and you're not paying attention!

53:56.859 --> 53:58.235
[Winfield] <i>Now is the time</i>

53:58.318 --> 54:01.613
<i>where you start to see
that being tired take effect.</i>

54:01.696 --> 54:02.697
Fuck!

54:04.449 --> 54:06.827
Bullshit! Bullshit!

54:06.911 --> 54:09.746
[Crowder] <i>And you see players</i>
<i>grabbing their toes,</i>

54:09.830 --> 54:11.373
<i>trying to stretch out their legs.</i>

54:11.957 --> 54:15.002
<i>Cramp's gonna be a big factor here
over the final minutes.</i>

54:15.085 --> 54:16.837
[Buddy] I ain't got
more offensive linemen.

54:16.921 --> 54:17.981
I ain't got any offensive linemen...

54:18.005 --> 54:20.007
Next time we go out,
he's gotta go at left guard.

54:20.090 --> 54:23.343
- Snoop! Snoop! Snoop! Snoop!
- Snoop! Snoop! Snoop! Snoop!

54:23.427 --> 54:26.263
- [sighs] This some bullshit, man.
- [player] Let's go, dog.

54:26.346 --> 54:29.433
All right, listen to me.
You're in over at left guard now, okay?

54:29.516 --> 54:32.937
Hey, you gotta tell him
who to block. Snoop?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.814
Get your head up, find somebody,

54:34.897 --> 54:36.816
and hold the piss out of 'em.
You understand?

54:36.899 --> 54:39.335
[Crowder] <i>Twin receivers either side,</i>
<i>creeping up on linebackers.</i>

54:52.289 --> 54:54.624
Get up! Get up!

54:57.002 --> 55:00.755
Get up! Get up!

55:02.299 --> 55:04.551
[Buddy] No laying on the ground anymore,
you understand?

55:04.634 --> 55:06.386
Ever. Ever! You don't lay on the ground.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.263
You never let 'em see it. You understand?

55:08.347 --> 55:09.473
[Vijay] Yeah.

55:09.556 --> 55:12.309
[Buddy] I cannot baby you anymore!
It's big time.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.912
We gotta score two or three more times,

55:13.936 --> 55:16.605
and it ain't happening
the way we're protectin'. You understand?

55:16.688 --> 55:19.233
And where it is, is with you five.

55:19.316 --> 55:23.863
I don't wanna see any more sad faces.
There's no more "my bads."

57:37.662 --> 57:39.140
<i>- and bouncing off one man...</i>
- [Winfield] <i>Fumble!</i>

57:39.164 --> 57:41.309
[Crowder] <i>There's a fumble</i>
<i>in the end zone picked up by Jones,</i>

57:41.333 --> 57:42.334
<i>and it's gonna be...</i>

57:42.417 --> 57:44.127
- No!
<i>- Moved out to the five-yard line.</i>

57:44.211 --> 57:45.462
[groaning]

57:46.671 --> 57:49.591
[player] Nigga, hold on to the ball
and run a motherfucker over, man!

57:49.674 --> 57:51.260
- [crowd cheering]
- Did he fumble that?

57:51.343 --> 57:53.762
[Crowder] <i>What an opportunity</i>
<i>that EMCC have squandered.</i>

57:53.845 --> 57:54.846
We're all right.

57:56.056 --> 57:58.392
[indistinct chatter]

57:58.475 --> 58:01.520
Look, in my first game,
I fumbled three times. Three times!

58:01.603 --> 58:03.644
- And the defense bailed me out.
- Get away from me.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.525
[Buddy] <i>Y'all stop 'em here. We'll score.</i>

58:06.608 --> 58:08.943
Y'all stop 'em, we'll score. Let's go.

58:09.028 --> 58:11.388
[Winfield] <i>You need your defense</i>
<i>to give you one more stand.</i>

58:11.446 --> 58:12.507
[Crowder] <i>A turnover would be huge.</i>

58:12.531 --> 58:14.533
<i>EMCC already has
four taken away from Jones.</i>

58:14.616 --> 58:16.868
Squeeze it, Philly! Squeeze it!

58:16.951 --> 58:18.512
[Crowder] <i>Huge third down, defensively.</i>

58:18.578 --> 58:20.390
<i>Blocker steps up,
fires it deep down the field,</i>

58:20.414 --> 58:21.581
<i>towards the end zone...</i>

58:21.665 --> 58:22.976
- Two-on-one.
<i>- Near side, and it's...</i>

58:23.000 --> 58:25.353
- [Ed Holly] That's ours!
<i>- Through a would-be interceptor's hands.</i>

58:25.377 --> 58:26.729
- [player] What the fuck?
<i>- It's incomplete.</i>

58:26.753 --> 58:28.547
<i>- Now they're throwing a flag.</i>
- Oh, my God!

58:28.630 --> 58:30.316
[Crowder] <i>It's interference?</i>
<i>How's it interference?</i>

58:30.340 --> 58:32.818
[Winfield] <i>I don't see</i>
<i>how that could be defensive interference.</i>

58:32.842 --> 58:34.011
What the hell was that?

58:34.094 --> 58:38.598
[Buddy] Hey, I'm trying to be good.
I'm praying to God to help me.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.143
But when you do stupid stuff like that,
that's ridiculous.

58:41.226 --> 58:44.313
- Holy cow!
- [Buddy] Hey, time out!

58:44.396 --> 58:46.690
[Ed Holly] Golly,
glad I don't have to do judgment

58:46.773 --> 58:48.650
on Judgment Day on that one.
That's horse crap.

58:48.733 --> 58:51.528
- Hey, Rick! Time out!
- [Ed Holly] That's awful!

58:51.611 --> 58:53.697
7:30 left. Come on, let's go!

58:53.780 --> 58:56.200
Fourth quarter of a football game,
that is awful.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.536
- [groaning]
- [player] I'm tired of this shit, man.

58:59.619 --> 59:01.038
We are outplaying them.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.748
You have to believe
that the ball's coming your way.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.500
Don't let the referees come in this.

59:05.584 --> 59:09.338
Take the ball and score,
and be a freaking hero.

59:09.421 --> 59:10.940
Greatest comeback
in East Mississippi history.

59:10.964 --> 59:12.650
- Greatest comeback ever!
- [Ed Holly] Make it happen.

59:12.674 --> 59:16.761
[Buddy] Hey, hey, D! D!
If you'll hold 'em out, by God, we'll win.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.489
- Understand? Let's go.
- [player] All right.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.783
[Crowder] <i>Goal to go from the nine</i>
<i>of EMCC. EMCC creeping up.</i>

59:20.807 --> 59:23.352
<i>They get the backfielder
and they hit him and knock him down.</i>

59:23.435 --> 59:25.104
[cheering]

59:26.980 --> 59:29.250
- [Crowder] <i>Good job by defense.</i>
- [player] <i>Blast that nigga!</i>

59:29.274 --> 59:30.876
[Crowder]
<i>It's going to bring up fourth down,</i>

59:30.900 --> 59:32.670
<i>so it's gonna be
a 30-yard field goal attempt,</i>

59:32.694 --> 59:35.155
<i>- and it is... good!</i>
- [Ed Holly] Miss it, miss it!

59:35.239 --> 59:38.200
<i>A 27-19 lead.</i>

59:38.283 --> 59:39.963
That's okay. Field goal. Who gives a crap?

59:40.619 --> 59:42.871
<i>Good job!
It's a one-score game, baby.</i>

59:42.954 --> 59:45.707
There you go! Let's go.
One score, that's the way to ball!

59:45.790 --> 59:47.417
Here we go, nice job, nice job.

59:47.501 --> 59:48.561
[Crowder] <i>Only an eight-point deficit.</i>

59:48.585 --> 59:50.605
<i>You could still go and score
and get a two-point conversion.</i>

59:50.629 --> 59:52.214
[Winfield] <i>But need to go in a hurry.</i>

59:52.297 --> 59:53.548
[Buddy] Hey, here we go.

59:53.632 --> 59:55.884
Go, go, go. Go, go!

59:55.967 --> 59:58.720
Hold on, it's third down, it's third down.
It's third down, damn it.

59:58.803 --> 1:00:01.055
- [Rod] Easy, easy, easy!
- [Buddy] Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:00:01.139 --> 1:00:04.643
Uh, run it. Shit. You already made...
Back up! Goddamn, Rod, back up.

1:00:04.726 --> 1:00:07.146
You already made the call,
God damn it. Shit, Rod.

1:00:07.229 --> 1:00:08.956
[Winfield] <i>Here's the snap.</i>
<i>Miller, screen pass.</i>

1:00:08.980 --> 1:00:10.607
<i>Almost threw an interception.</i>

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:13.090
- Goddamn! You made the fucking call.
- [Rod] I said, "Easy."

1:00:13.152 --> 1:00:14.611
[Buddy] On the ball. On the ball.

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:17.947
[Winfield] <i>Two of the receivers were</i>
<i>turned around, talking to the sidelines,</i>

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:19.491
<i>when that football was snapped.</i>

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:23.828
<i>They were not ready to run that play,
and now you have no choice,</i>

1:00:23.912 --> 1:00:26.349
<i>I don't think, but to go for it here
on fourth down and eight.</i>

1:00:26.373 --> 1:00:27.291
[Crowder] <i>They're gonna go for it.</i>

1:00:27.374 --> 1:00:29.000
- Rod, know to call...
- I said, "Easy."

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:30.585
[stammers] I don't give a goddamn

1:00:30.669 --> 1:00:32.129
- until I fucking call it.
- Okay.

1:00:32.212 --> 1:00:34.464
- Shut up, Rod. Rod. Rod. Rod.
- [Rod] Goddamn.

1:00:34.548 --> 1:00:36.049
- Shut up or get the fuck out.
- Okay.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:38.302
[Crowder] <i>Fourth down.</i>
<i>What do you do here? This is...</i>

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:39.737
[Winfield] <i>Gotta throw for the first.</i>

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:41.239
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap,</i>
<i>here's pressure.</i>

1:00:41.263 --> 1:00:43.265
<i>Picked up, firing it, and it is...</i>

1:00:43.348 --> 1:00:46.435
<i>Caught! At the 48-yard line, first down.
And that'll stop the clock.</i>

1:00:46.518 --> 1:00:48.163
[Winfield] <i>And that's gonna be</i>
<i>a first down.</i>

1:00:48.187 --> 1:00:49.854
[Buddy] Get out of here.

1:00:49.938 --> 1:00:52.774
I am talking to you like a man.
I am talking to you like a man.

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:55.360
Like a man that needs
to get his goddamn job done.

1:00:55.444 --> 1:00:57.904
No, you ain't,
you calling without me calling it.

1:00:57.988 --> 1:01:01.992
This is a motherfucking comeback.
I'm calling this shit.

1:01:02.075 --> 1:01:04.869
[Crowder] <i>So that was a huge play</i>
<i>by Ducksworth. Clock rolling.</i>

1:01:04.953 --> 1:01:07.121
[Buddy] West! Look outside!

1:01:07.206 --> 1:01:08.540
Get him. Get him!

1:01:08.623 --> 1:01:11.001
[Crowder] <i>Miller, the freshman,</i>

1:01:11.626 --> 1:01:13.127
<i>Back to pass, inside pressure,</i>

1:01:13.212 --> 1:01:14.772
<i>flushed out of the pocket,
rolls to the near side.</i>

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:17.024
<i>Gonna pump it, now fire to the end zone!
Wide open receiver...</i>

1:01:17.048 --> 1:01:19.259
<i>- Caught! Touchdown, EMCC!</i>
- [crowd cheering]

1:01:19.343 --> 1:01:20.552
[cheering]

1:01:22.095 --> 1:01:24.889

<i>Jones on top,
EMCC has a chance to tie this one up.</i>

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:34.941
[Crowder] <i>So now here comes EMCC</i>

1:01:35.024 --> 1:01:38.695
[Buddy] This is money. Hey, this is money.

1:01:38.778 --> 1:01:41.656
Everybody know what they got?
Hey, come here! Come here!

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:43.783
I don't wanna... Listen to me.
Hey, hey, come here.

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:49.038
They're... Hey, shut up!
Just calm... Hey! Calm down!

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:53.252
Listen to me, get out there
and line up in your bunch and let's roll.

1:01:55.254 --> 1:01:57.589
[Crowder] <i>So, here's the ball game,</i>
<i>folks. 32 seconds left.</i>

1:01:57.672 --> 1:01:59.716
[Winfield] <i>You gotta put the ball</i>
<i>in the end zone.</i>

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:03.262
<i>Whatever you have in the bag,
now is the time to use it.</i>

1:02:03.345 --> 1:02:05.013
[Crowder] <i>EMCC trails by two.</i>

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:08.892
<i>Awaiting the snap. Here it is.
Miller back to pass, backside pressure.</i>

1:02:08.975 --> 1:02:12.270
<i>Throws as he's hit,
and it's knocked away at the goal line.</i>

1:02:12.354 --> 1:02:16.608
[Crowder] <i>Crowell had it momentarily,</i>
<i>and it was knocked away.</i>

1:02:16.691 --> 1:02:18.943
<i>And EMCC is gonna drop game one.</i>

1:02:19.027 --> 1:02:22.322
<i>But what a valiant effort.
With only 32 players,</i>

1:02:22.406 --> 1:02:25.325
<i>all freshmen except
for some transfer sophomores.</i>

1:02:25.409 --> 1:02:27.952
<i>No one who was a part of this program
a year ago.</i>

1:02:28.036 --> 1:02:30.163
<i>They came up just a bit short.</i>

[marching band playing]

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:39.964

Hey. Every eye, right here.
Look at me. Look at me!

1:02:49.891 --> 1:02:53.687
I have never been more proud

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:55.229
I am more proud right now

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:58.149
than any game
that I have ever coached in my life.

1:02:58.817 --> 1:03:00.026
Do you understand me?

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:04.197
You fought and you kept fighting,
and, hey, under great odds.

1:03:04.698 --> 1:03:05.990
I am so proud of you.

1:03:06.783 --> 1:03:09.494
Now, let's get ourselves together

1:03:09.577 --> 1:03:12.706
and let's come back tomorrow
as a whole team.

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:17.627
You got it? Because I promise you,
if we get everybody together,

1:03:17.711 --> 1:03:21.089
we're pretty doggone good. You understand?

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:22.341
Hey, you look at me!

1:03:22.424 --> 1:03:24.426

I don't ever recall
a performance by a bunch of freshmen

1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:44.696
