00:13.614 --> 00:16.283
(ominous music)

00:31.199 --> 00:33.734
(mysterious music)

00:33.734 --> 00:35.403
- Looks like a tracer.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.272
(mysterious music)

02:20.841 --> 02:23.110
- Looks like a little
eye flicker over there.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.314
I think he might be coming to.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.382
- You can see the fire
in his eyes again.

02:34.954 --> 02:39.660
- [Tyler] It's about time
your sorry butt woke up.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.494
- Hey Tyler.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.464
- [Tyler] I'm glad
you're okay, man.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.199
You gave us all a
really big scare there.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.271
Anyway, get well soon, okay?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.539
We got some gigs lined up.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.708
- Not to mention
homework assignments.

02:55.843 --> 03:00.748
Monty, how are you feeling?

03:01.349 --> 03:01.849
- Hey professor.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.987
(Monty groans)

03:10.090 --> 03:11.058
I've felt better.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.596
Can somebody to tell
me why I'm here?

03:15.596 --> 03:19.132
And why I have such
a massive headache?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.534
- Let's just say

03:20.534 --> 03:22.570
that you gave Humpty
Dumpty a run for his money.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.804
- You had a great fall.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.174
- So then when are
all the king's horses

03:27.174 --> 03:29.610
and all the king's
men showing up?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.345
- I'm afraid you're
looking at 'em.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.716
Monty, you may be wondering
who this gentleman is.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.752
It's Detective Shek.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.256
he would like to ask
you some questions,

03:42.256 --> 03:44.124
but only if you feel up to it.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.828
- Hi Monty.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.897
If this gets to be
too much for you,

03:49.897 --> 03:51.164
we can do it another day.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.337
- Got nothing else
better to do so hit me.

03:58.204 --> 04:00.508
- Apparently you were
walking down the sidewalk

04:00.508 --> 04:04.645
on Westover Avenue
and you collapsed,

04:04.645 --> 04:06.213
hit your head on the pavement.

04:06.213 --> 04:09.116
You've been unconscious here
for the last three days.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.183
- Three days?

04:10.183 --> 04:11.018
- Yeah.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.455
The staff here has
taken some blood tests

04:14.455 --> 04:17.957
and they found traces of
gamma hydroxybutyrate,

04:17.957 --> 04:20.160
GHB in your system.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.394
You ever heard of that?

04:22.430 --> 04:25.098
- No, are you kidding me?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.535
- I wish I was.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.637
You don't seem like
the kind of guy

04:29.637 --> 04:31.138
that would do that consciously.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.774
It's the kind of drug that's
usually given to somebody

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
without their
consent or knowledge.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.480
It's kind of like
a date rape drug.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.650
- That's awful.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.753
- It was probably given to you

04:45.753 --> 04:47.154
about a half hour
before you collapsed.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.023
Do you remember coming
in contact with anyone

04:50.023 --> 04:50.858
prior to that?

04:52.693 --> 04:53.961
- Off the top of my head.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.632
- Well, what's
left of it anyway.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.335
- Lame.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.475
- I'm drawing a
blank, detective.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.843
- Can we just let this
young man get some rest?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.714
They'll be plenty of
time for questions later.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.548
- Sure.

05:21.422 --> 05:25.659
- Wait, I do remember now.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.095
(ominous music)

05:28.095 --> 05:28.996
Professor Derring.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.766
He stopped by the apartment
while I was there.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.605
- What on Earth for?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.073
- That's what I thought.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.175
He dropped off this book.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.445
Kind of weird, you know,

05:44.445 --> 05:47.648
he just popped up unannounced.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.649
- Yeah, it sure is.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.386
Where you one of his students?

05:52.386 --> 05:55.823
- No, but I stopped
by his office one time

05:55.823 --> 05:58.091
to ask him a physics question.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.598
- We can pick this
up another time.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.803
- Monty, we've got to go

06:11.772 --> 06:13.240
but you take care of yourself

06:14.374 --> 06:16.477
and you get plenty
of rest, okay?

06:18.912 --> 06:19.913
- Thank you.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.383
- [Tyler] Yeah,
rest up champ, okay?

06:30.658 --> 06:31.492
- Hey Tyler?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.462
- Yeah, what's up?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.398
- Thanks for being there, buddy.

06:48.108 --> 06:48.976
- Daisy.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.711
- Hey professor.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.380
It's sad this happened to Monty.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.148
- I know

06:56.817 --> 06:59.820
but you know he was
actually pretty lucky.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.056
It could've been worse.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.626
But hey, thanks for stopping by.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.394
- Luck?

07:08.696 --> 07:10.297
- What was that?

07:10.297 --> 07:13.000
- You said Monty was lucky
that it wasn't worse.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.869
Did you say that for me

07:15.869 --> 07:17.671
because you know
I'm a non-believer?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.341
Deep down did you
really want to say

07:21.341 --> 07:23.443
that maybe his guardian
angel stepped up?

07:25.479 --> 07:27.681
It's okay, it'll be our secret.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.319
I'll say a prayer
for him just in case.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.058
(mysterious music)

07:42.896 --> 07:43.697
- You know I,

07:44.865 --> 07:46.867
I've never had a good
feeling about that guy.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.036
- Who?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.805
- My colleague,
Professor Derring.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.342
- Charles.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.044
- Yeah?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.113
- We still haven't given
up on your grandson.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.652
- I know, thank you.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.124
(mysterious music)

08:18.532 --> 08:22.502
- Shay, where are you?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.172
(ominous music)

08:44.091 --> 08:46.694
- [Dr. Weber] Three years
sober, not too shabby.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.866
- [Charles] But every
day is like day one.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.872
- And the flashbacks?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.875
- I thought you therapists
had this magic wand

09:01.875 --> 09:05.278
that you could just
sort of erase them.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.215
- Yeah well I had to send
mine out to be recalibrated.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.116
- Touche.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.391
- Okay, so tell me about
your new job situation.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.796
- Well, you know,
out of the blue,

09:22.796 --> 09:25.699
I got this offer to teach.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.200
- Well folks, once again,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.669
we're having a banner year,

09:28.669 --> 09:31.271
which means we're gonna
be adding an elective.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.105
- Crip course.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.674
- Sorry, crip course?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.575
- Useless and meaningless,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.010
fluff, for lack
of a better word.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.412
- However, whatever we call it,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.649
let's give 'em
their money's worth.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.985
Charles, even though
you're a full professor

09:44.985 --> 09:46.787
from a much larger university,

09:46.787 --> 09:49.857
we've always had the policy
of the last man or woman in

09:49.857 --> 09:52.292
gets to teach the crip course.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.495
- I accept my medicine.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.065
- Thank you for being
such a team player.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.566
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.234
- I'm sure.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.771
What's it gonna be?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.906
- We're calling it
"Why Religion?".

10:05.906 --> 10:07.107
There's no textbook

10:07.107 --> 10:09.877
so you'll be free to
take it where you want.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.712
- Professor, I,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.814
I don't think I'm the one you
want to teach this course.

10:13.814 --> 10:17.217
I mean well I'm not
really into the Bible

10:17.217 --> 10:20.721
or theology or
anything like that.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.822
- Come on old, man.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.023
You can handle it.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.726
- But then there was
this colleague of mine,

10:25.726 --> 10:28.896
he's just, I don't know.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.463
- Just what?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.633
- Well I guess there's
always one, you know?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.436
- One what?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.740
- I can't put my finger on it,

10:39.740 --> 10:42.743
but something's just not right.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.314
- So Monty, I know you've
been through a lot,

10:47.314 --> 10:50.350
but I want to try to piece
together all the details.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.786
So why don't we
reconstruct everything

10:52.786 --> 10:55.255
starting with when you
first started school here?

10:56.757 --> 11:01.294
- Well Tyler and I were
roommates and best of buds.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.363
We formed this musical duo.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.835
(gentle guitar music)

11:14.975 --> 11:16.509
(Monty sighs)

11:16.509 --> 11:20.580
Man, I thought we'd have a
recording contract by now.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.582
- Well all is not
lost, my friend.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.152
At least we'll have some
sort of degree this year.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.155
- Yeah, I'm thinking bigger.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.058
- Well, if we work hard

11:31.058 --> 11:32.625
and with the big guy's approval,

11:32.625 --> 11:33.460
it could happen.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.796
- Better pray harder then.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.932
- I don't think that's
how it works, bro.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.703
- [Monty] Hey, you
owe me one, Tyler.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.238
If you would've
signed up on time,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
we wouldn't have been
stuck in this crazy class.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.575
- [Tyler] Listen dude,

11:48.575 --> 11:49.843
I thought I would be
working this semester,

11:49.843 --> 11:51.912
but my uncle threw
me a few bucks.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.280
- Lucky you.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.449
Anyway, I'm psyched
about tonight.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.852
First day of classes always
brings a packed house.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.154
- Man, I'm excited for
that overflowing tip jar.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.028
(ominous music)

12:08.028 --> 12:10.597
- Dude, what are you
doing picking up trash?

12:10.597 --> 12:13.466
You turning into some
granola eating hippie freak?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.802
- No man, it's glass.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.403
I collect it everywhere I go.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.638
I've been doing that for awhile.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.672
- Dude, that's weird.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.443
I guess the apple doesn't
fall too far off the tree.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.612
His Uncle Lewis is
an archeologist,

12:25.612 --> 12:28.115
sends him bits of
glass from everywhere.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.051
Like his last dig, he
was in the Middle East.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.720
(Eastern music)

12:56.810 --> 12:58.311
- All right, all right, look,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.412
let's see what we have.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.085
Now that's it.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.154
Let's call it a day, huh?

13:08.989 --> 13:11.892
(mysterious music)

13:16.496 --> 13:18.565
- Wait, over here!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.170
- Ah let's see.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.504
Ah look at that.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.241
- [Yarin] What is it?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.244
- Most likely first century,

13:32.445 --> 13:36.616
probably Roman glass.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.989
Then again, it could just
be a broken beer bottle

13:41.989 --> 13:44.357
left behind by
some drunken Turks.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.429
Strange how it's glowing though.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.270
I know just who to send this to.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.307
- Someone who likes
rare antiquities?

14:01.308 --> 14:03.043
- You could say that.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.078
Thank you.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.013
Good job.

14:06.013 --> 14:06.980
See what else is in there.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.516
- And you and Tyler
had Professor Bando

14:09.516 --> 14:11.684
for one of your classes, right?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.387
- [Monty] Yeah, for the
"Why Religion?" class.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.356
- What was that like?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.590
- Good morning.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.326
I'm professor Charles Bando.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.162
Welcome to "Why Religion?"

14:22.162 --> 14:24.797
- I heard it's a crip
course so easy A.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.134
- Well, isn't it?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.402
- Gentlemen, I may
look over the hill,

14:29.402 --> 14:33.506
but rest assured my
hearing is stellar.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.575
- Sorry, Monty Lawrence.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.577
- [Charles] And your friend?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.346
- Tyler Samuel, sir.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.513
- Nice start.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.318
- So here we are,
my young friends,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.988
"Why Religion?" and why not?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.822
Our job over the next few weeks

14:49.822 --> 14:51.925
is to make a case if you can,

14:51.925 --> 14:54.527
but don't expect me
to teach you the Bible

14:54.527 --> 14:57.197
and I don't need to
know what faith you are.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.598
- Ah, oui oui, mademoiselle.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.136
Hey, you should come
see us play tonight.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.338
- Ah, are you any good?

15:05.338 --> 15:06.974
- I think we're pretty good.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.208
- Pretty good?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.276
We're really good.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.810
- Okay yeah, we're pretty good.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.448
- And you gonna tell me where?

15:15.448 --> 15:16.984
- Beans and Vines.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.686
- Yeah, past Columbia and Main.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.722
- Okay, so see you guys.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.229
(laughing)

15:29.229 --> 15:30.330
- My glass collection.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.000
I've got a whole
box full of these.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.770
- Hmm, one man's trash is
another man's treasure.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.007
- Glass making goes
back thousands of years

15:40.007 --> 15:41.674
in Egypt and Mesopotamia.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.112
I just, I just hope the class

15:45.112 --> 15:46.579
doesn't think it's too weird.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.082
- Oh dude, the class?

15:49.082 --> 15:50.583
You can't share the class.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.419
They'll find it too weird.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.021
- Really?

15:54.021 --> 15:54.887
- Dude, I'm kidding.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.356
Gosh, lighten up.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.690
- Well, what about you?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.559
You said you didn't
have any hobbies.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.931
(gentle guitar music)

16:05.999 --> 16:08.501
- Sound, sound fascinates me.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.170
- In what way?

16:12.639 --> 16:15.108
- What happens with sound
when we no longer hear it?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.909
Does it leave a footprint?

16:17.977 --> 16:21.648
- Yeah, CDs, cassettes, tapes.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.252
- But this conversation,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.955
what happens when
we stop talking?

16:28.955 --> 16:30.923
Is it gone forever?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.597
Now while you're
chewing on that one,

16:37.597 --> 16:40.067
let's get going, we got a gig.

16:40.067 --> 16:44.037
That's when things started
getting a little weird.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.106
- [Detective Shek]
Weird, in what way?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.441
- [Monty] I don't know
how to describe it,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.577
strange things
started happening.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.480
I heard this kind
of whoosh sound

16:53.480 --> 16:56.083
and it gave me
this weird feeling.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.552
Then, after, Tyler tells
me about this phone call

16:59.552 --> 17:01.354
he gets from his Uncle Lewis,

17:01.354 --> 17:04.191
something about this new
artifact he's sending.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.228
- [Samuels] Hey Tyler, I
think I may have something

17:08.228 --> 17:10.029
of interest for you.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.531
I'm gonna send it in the mail.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.969
(mysterious music)

17:20.973 --> 17:23.376
* Heavy line

17:26.445 --> 17:28.115
(audience applauding)

17:28.115 --> 17:30.049
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.319
- Hello, you too.
- Oh hey.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.323
(mysterious music)

17:54.241 --> 17:55.074
- Wow.

17:56.876 --> 17:57.710
Huh.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.013
Nice find, Uncle Lewis.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.284
(gentle country music)

18:13.993 --> 18:16.996
- Good afternoon,
how's it going?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.132
- Couldn't be better.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.367
- What can I get for you?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.338
- Shot of whiskey
and a bottled water.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.774
- Sounds like a good choice.

18:35.047 --> 18:39.152
- Hi son, I just want to talk.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.423
Please give me a call
when you get a chance.

18:47.059 --> 18:47.894
I love you.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.330
Dad.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.119
- Saving the best
for last, I see?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.122
- Not today.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.024
Thanks.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.600
- Not gonna throw
that away, are ya?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.669
- I had another close call

19:32.104 --> 19:35.375
but I was able to
pull through it.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.011
- Charles, as of yet,

19:39.011 --> 19:40.213
you haven't really told me

19:40.213 --> 19:43.750
exactly what you're
having flashbacks about,

19:43.750 --> 19:44.951
only that you have them.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.991
- Well, it's a long story.

19:53.626 --> 19:57.564
My wife, my son,
my daughter-in-law
don't talk to me.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.868
We haven't spoken
for three years.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.305
- I understand.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.876
Well, tell me about the classes
you taught last semester.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.646
- Well, the class that I
had least looked forward to

20:15.448 --> 20:18.485
I actually liked the best.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.220
It's got a great bunch of kids.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.223
- Professor, if your lesson's
a complete flop today,

20:24.223 --> 20:25.625
blame Tyler and Monte.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.394
They played so well no
one wanted to leave.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.728
- That good, eh?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
- Yeah so so.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.233
- All right, gang,
let's get to it.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.304
Why do people
engage in religion?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.307
- Well I mean isn't it whether
you just believe or not?

20:40.307 --> 20:42.675
- No, it's not that easy.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.744
- [Charles] Well explain
yourself, Miss Tenna.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.978
- It doesn't explain

20:45.978 --> 20:47.880
all the different
religions or churches.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.583
- You would've thought they
would've narrowed them down

20:50.583 --> 20:52.652
after a few thousand
years, right?

20:52.652 --> 20:55.054
- I think church goers are lazy.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.657
- [Charles] Well that's a
pretty profound statement.

20:57.657 --> 21:01.093
Do you mean churchgoers
or just believers?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.297
- Both, I have no
use for religion.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.032
- [Tyler] For now.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.735
- [Charles] What was
that, Mr. Samuels?

21:08.735 --> 21:12.138
- I said she has no use for now.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.740
- Well how about I play
the devil's advocate

21:13.740 --> 21:16.275
and ask you to explain yourself?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.979
- Devil's advocate, doesn't
that assume the devil exists?

21:19.979 --> 21:23.816
- Well, what do you believe?

21:25.918 --> 21:28.488
- I believe in the power
of the Lord Jesus Christ

21:28.488 --> 21:30.757
and that the devil
exists in his absence.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.437
Hey, hey, so thanks for
that hearty endorsement

21:44.437 --> 21:46.706
of our performance last night.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.776
- Just trying to make you
better, challenging you.

21:52.745 --> 21:56.449
- So a cup of coffee
at the Beans tonight?

21:56.449 --> 22:00.620
- Mmm, you will
be serenading me?

22:00.620 --> 22:03.122
- No, I could never do
that to my worst enemy.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.326
- Good, see you at eight.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.831
- Ready man?

22:11.831 --> 22:12.765
- Let's do it.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.766
- All right.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.003
- Asking me for coffee
twice in a week,

22:18.771 --> 22:20.707
I'm not sure about that.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.842
- Okay, well Tuesday
was for coffee.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.811
On Fridays, I work
on fan appeal.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.214
- Is it hard work?

22:28.214 --> 22:31.017
- If they're as tough as
you yes, it's hard work.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.555
- Oh the kids are
making me feel old.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.089
- Must be tough.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.992
- Hey, you're not exactly
a spring chicken yourself.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.429
- White wine for the
lady, a red for myself.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.531
Make sure they're
both in a real glass.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.399
- Don't worry, we won't
bring out the styrofoam

22:46.399 --> 22:47.634
until at least your third glass.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.602
- Just get the wine.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.904
(giggling)

22:54.273 --> 22:55.675
- What's with the no glass look?

22:55.675 --> 22:57.410
You doing a Harold
Lloyd impression?

22:57.410 --> 23:00.547
- That's for me to know
and for you to find it.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.816
- So basically, Tyler
gets this crazy idea

23:03.816 --> 23:06.519
to take the artifact
he got from his uncle

23:06.519 --> 23:08.888
along with some of the
other pieces of glass

23:08.888 --> 23:10.322
and solder them together.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.431
(gentle guitar music)

23:24.637 --> 23:27.707
Hey, why'd you decide to
do this with the glasses?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.811
- My uncle recently just
sent me another piece

23:31.811 --> 23:34.614
and I thought, you know,
it was being put to waste.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.785
So I put all my glass in to
a piece of lens and you know,

23:38.785 --> 23:42.354
it's pretty cool, look at the
world through colored glass.

23:42.354 --> 23:45.792
Yeah listen, I
was gonna ask you,

23:47.159 --> 23:50.396
how do you feel about
playing everything tonight,

23:50.396 --> 23:52.932
you know, even the
Christian songs we wrote?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.904
- Okay, I mean if you
feel that confident.

23:57.904 --> 23:58.705
- Oh I do.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.108
- All right, I mean I guess so.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.777
- All right, well we
gotta head out though,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.479
because it's soon and we
got practice there, okay?

24:06.479 --> 24:08.114
- But wait, do me a favor,

24:08.114 --> 24:10.483
just make sure you
don't blow our careers.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.120
(Tyler sighs)

24:17.089 --> 24:19.091
- Alrighty, let's go.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.866
(ominous music)

24:53.993 --> 24:55.227
- I wanted to get this-

24:55.227 --> 24:57.564
- Hey man, some guy just
ran past me out front

24:57.564 --> 25:00.199
with a long stick or tool.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.300
He just ran out back,

25:01.300 --> 25:02.468
you might want to go catch him.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.070
- Um, nice glasses.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.839
- Forgot I had 'em on.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.743
- Well, it's probably
just a street bum

25:10.743 --> 25:12.812
and I'll check it out
when I go on break.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.682
- Okay.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.484
(mysterious music)

25:18.484 --> 25:20.152
- [Male] That boy
needs help bad.

25:21.020 --> 25:21.921
- He does, really bad.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.123
These kids these days.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.057
- [Detective Shek] Tell me more

25:25.057 --> 25:27.126
about this Professor Derring.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.997
- To be honest, he kind
of strikes me as rather

25:30.997 --> 25:33.099
distant and cold.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.802
- Excuse me, Monty?

25:38.037 --> 25:40.272
Detective Shek,
how can I help you?

25:40.272 --> 25:41.674
- [Charles] Detective,
this is Charles Bando.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.442
I was just checking
to see if Lee and Ben

25:43.442 --> 25:46.378
had made it in to sign the
declaration of death for Shay.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.447
- No, they never
showed up or called.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.651
I'll let you know when they do.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.985
- [Charles] Thanks detective.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.400
- Welcome professor.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.703
It looks like you're making
the most of that crip course.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.173
- And how's that, JL?

26:14.173 --> 26:15.441
- Marguerite and I

26:15.441 --> 26:16.508
were at the Beans
and Vines Coffee Shop

26:16.508 --> 26:17.744
a couple of days ago-

26:17.744 --> 26:20.179
- And a couple of your
students going on and on

26:20.179 --> 26:25.184
about how your lectures were
so divisive and you know,

26:25.918 --> 26:28.054
upsetting, disturbing.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.624
- I actually think
they call that passion.

26:31.624 --> 26:35.361
And as both of you know,
young folks have a lot of that

26:37.129 --> 26:41.934
or maybe I'm just
interesting enough

26:41.934 --> 26:43.903
that the students
actually learn.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.907
Oh I'm sorry I have to go,

26:47.907 --> 26:50.777
but you two have a nice day.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.048
- You too.

26:56.048 --> 26:59.185
- So the one thing
that concerns me

26:59.185 --> 27:03.923
is that recently I had a
flashback during my class.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.459
Miracles and coincidence-

27:07.459 --> 27:09.662
- You left off one other
important word professor.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.798
- All right Daisy, enlighten us.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.065
- Hoax.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.033
- Interesting, but
why would someone

27:14.033 --> 27:15.868
want to try to fool someone

27:15.868 --> 27:18.570
into believing something
that isn't true?

27:19.405 --> 27:20.639
- I think a lot of them

27:20.639 --> 27:22.709
are just trying to
convince themselves.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.643
- Yeah, they're just looking
for someone or something

27:24.643 --> 27:25.945
to justify their beliefs.

27:25.945 --> 27:28.114
- How can you say it?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.581
Miracles happen all the time,

27:29.581 --> 27:31.483
we're just not paying attention.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.853
- I agree, the old saying

27:33.853 --> 27:35.354
if a tree fall in the forest,

27:35.354 --> 27:36.889
we cannot hear them all.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.391
- [Charles] Good point.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.494
- I have another angle.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.664
What if people were in the
wrong place at the wrong time

27:45.664 --> 27:49.035
or the right place
at the right time?

27:49.035 --> 27:49.969
- No!

27:49.969 --> 27:52.404
- I'm done, I am done with you.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.940
- Wait, wait!

27:53.940 --> 27:56.175
(dramatic music)

27:56.175 --> 28:01.013
- Mr. Bando, we were
interested in what you think.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.250
- Um (clears throat),

28:04.250 --> 28:08.654
listen class, I'm going to
hold my opinions for now.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.357
I asked for your
unabashed thoughts

28:11.357 --> 28:13.259
and we got them.

28:13.259 --> 28:17.463
So let's turn to the assignment

28:17.463 --> 28:19.565
on our hobbies and interests.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.134
You know I thought this
would really be a good way

28:22.134 --> 28:23.669
that we could maybe
get a better feel

28:23.669 --> 28:25.271
for where we're all coming from.

28:28.007 --> 28:28.975
The floor is yours.

28:32.611 --> 28:33.512
- I'm a sound man.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.582
- Seems natural for a musician.

28:36.582 --> 28:37.917
Must be a gift.

28:37.917 --> 28:38.851
- From who?

28:38.851 --> 28:39.786
Where did he get that gift?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.487
- From God, of course.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.488
- Yeah right.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.356
You mean his parents.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.524
- I've always wondered

28:45.524 --> 28:46.793
whether sounds leaves
behind a fossil.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.360
Like wouldn't it
be great to hear

28:48.360 --> 28:49.295
and listen to what people said

28:49.295 --> 28:51.463
long before they had recordings?

28:51.463 --> 28:52.932
- So let me guess,

28:52.932 --> 28:57.036
so you can like hear Jesus's
words in his own voice?

28:57.036 --> 28:58.004
- Yeah kinda.

28:58.004 --> 28:58.971
- [Daisy] Whatever.

29:00.006 --> 29:00.973
- You're not from the valley.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.174
- What do you know?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.010
I'm originally
from Encino, dork.

29:04.010 --> 29:07.613
- Oh all right now, that's
enough, no putdowns.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.350
Tyler?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.586
- So this might sound
a little strange,

29:14.586 --> 29:18.657
but I collect unique
pieces of broken glass.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.292
I've been doing it
since I was a kid

29:20.292 --> 29:22.528
and I just look for
it wherever I go.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.232
- This is true, I have
seen him in action.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.435
- Any particular reason?

29:29.435 --> 29:33.772
- I believe that pieces of
glass can capture an image

29:33.772 --> 29:35.774
of what was happening
at that time.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.610
- Interesting.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.181
- Are you ready now to tell
me exactly what happened

29:42.181 --> 29:44.416
the day your grandson
was kidnapped?

29:50.222 --> 29:53.893
- It was a typical
Sunday, beautiful day.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.530
My son and daughter-in-law
were out of town

29:58.530 --> 30:00.632
so we had Shay for the weekend.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.603
(light cheery music)

30:09.175 --> 30:11.377
- I slept wonderfully.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.711
- Me too, grandma.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.380
Here's your breakfast.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.216
Grandpa and I woke up
early just to surprise you.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.552
- Well actually Shay
did most of the work.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.389
I really didn't help that much.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.991
- This is so sweet.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.995
It looks absolutely delicious.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.700
Oh Charles, it's
such a beautiful day.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.970
Let's do something really
fun and neat with Shay

30:37.970 --> 30:39.505
before we take him home.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.772
- I think that's great

30:40.772 --> 30:43.442
so we'll go right after church.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.811
- Can't we just
skip church today?

30:47.213 --> 30:50.883
- Well, I mean it's only an hour

30:50.883 --> 30:54.420
and well I kind of think we
need to set a good example

30:54.420 --> 30:56.455
for Shay and besides,

30:56.455 --> 30:59.225
I kind of think that's what
Ben and Lee would want.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.059
I'll be right there, Shay.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.128
We don't want to be late.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.763
- [Grandma] He's
all ready to go.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.639
- All right, you take care.

31:47.639 --> 31:48.907
- I will babe.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.142
I'll see you in
just a little bit.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.443
- I'll see you
after church, yeah?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.079
Okay Shay, let's go.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.251
(grandma chuckling)

32:01.853 --> 32:04.523
(ominous music)

32:17.503 --> 32:22.508
(church bells ringing)
(organ music)

32:36.222 --> 32:38.057
- Oh hey Shay.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.725
Hey good morning, Charles.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.293
How are you?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.095
- Hey Charles, we might
need a little help

32:43.095 --> 32:44.463
with some of the elders.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.364
- Okay, all right.

32:46.565 --> 32:50.069
Hey, good morning, Mrs.
McKendree, how are you?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.771
- I need to go to the bathroom.

32:52.771 --> 32:56.542
- Oh, can you wait until
I seat Mrs. McKendree?

32:56.542 --> 32:58.544
- [Leigh] Charles,
I can take him.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.513
- Okay well, it's
always a pleasure

33:01.513 --> 33:03.182
when you're here with us.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.150
- [Mrs. McKendree] Oh
I'm so glad to be here.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.851
- No, no, I'll take him.

33:05.851 --> 33:08.187
- Oh thanks.
- Come on, Shay.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.026
- Oh good, here's your seat.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.195
It's available, good, good.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.796
- [Mrs. McKendree] Thank
you so much Charles.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.298
- Watch your hand.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.972
- Barry, where's Shay?

33:26.972 --> 33:28.240
- I was washing my hands,

33:28.240 --> 33:29.508
I turned around he
was out the door.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.243
I thought he'd be
back in his seat.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.216
(ominous music)

33:37.216 --> 33:39.085
- Folks, let's take
a moment to pray.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.988
(ominous music)

33:44.990 --> 33:45.824
- Shay!
- Shay!

33:47.459 --> 33:48.427
- Where are you?

33:49.661 --> 33:50.862
- [Male] Shay!

33:50.862 --> 33:52.298
- What happened there
affected everybody

33:52.298 --> 33:54.766
and many left.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.537
The giving dropped
down to almost nothing.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.573
The pastor had to step down.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.476
It was a royal mess.

34:06.512 --> 34:09.047
I, the whole church,

34:09.047 --> 34:12.851
we searched the entire
building, we, every office,

34:18.489 --> 34:19.425
every classroom.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.594
- Oh no, have you been drinking?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.764
Have you really
been drinking again?

34:26.998 --> 34:27.998
Charles, I can't do it.

34:27.998 --> 34:28.934
I can't do it.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.469
I am not gonna do this anymore.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.371
We've been over it and over it.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.205
- No honey-

34:33.205 --> 34:34.473
- I am done!

34:34.473 --> 34:37.409
I am done with you
and your excuses.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.577
- Wait, wait!

34:38.577 --> 34:39.610
You've got to listen
to me because-

34:39.610 --> 34:40.545
- No, I'm not gonna-

34:40.545 --> 34:42.848
- He was my grandson, too.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.350
- You make me sick.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.418
- I never had a drop that day.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.652
- [Grandma] Get off of me.

34:47.652 --> 34:48.554
- [Charles] Don't
you believe me?

34:48.554 --> 34:50.322
- I've had it, I'm done.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.190
I'm not doing this anymore.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.425
Don't you get it?

34:53.425 --> 34:58.430
(Charles crying)
(sad music)

35:08.106 --> 35:11.009
(Charles mumbling)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.549
- Not a word.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.784
Not a trace.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.887
My wife blames me and-

35:23.054 --> 35:25.191
- I can't even imagine
what it's like for you,

35:26.091 --> 35:27.326
for all of you.

35:29.027 --> 35:32.231
So your daughter-in-law
and wife both blame you

35:32.231 --> 35:33.799
because they
suspect you might've

35:33.799 --> 35:35.867
gone back to drinking again?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.536
- I didn't have
a drink that day.

35:38.737 --> 35:42.007
Now I admit I came
close to a relapse

35:42.007 --> 35:44.976
but you know I was able
to keep it together,

35:46.345 --> 35:48.714
but nobody, including my son,

35:48.714 --> 35:50.716
none of the family
will talk to me.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.285
My wife is planning
to divorce me

35:54.486 --> 35:58.524
and it's all based on
a false accusation.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.561
- Charles, I admire
you remaining sober.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.163
And from what I can tell

36:05.163 --> 36:07.966
what happened is not
your fault whatsoever.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.670
- Well, thank you.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.375
- There's a recording,

36:16.375 --> 36:19.211
a never ending loop
going around your head.

36:20.579 --> 36:24.616
So you need to listen to
me, Dr. Charles Bando,

36:25.717 --> 36:27.853
you're a good man.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.987
You hear me?

36:28.987 --> 36:31.357
A good man.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.726
Yeah, you've messed up
in life, we all have,

36:34.726 --> 36:38.163
but at your core, in
your heart of hearts,

36:38.163 --> 36:39.731
you want to do the right thing.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.271
- But how do I convince my wife

36:45.271 --> 36:48.907
and my son and my
daughter-in-law?

36:48.907 --> 36:52.844
Because all they know is
that their son is gone

36:55.481 --> 36:58.784
and that it happened on my watch

37:00.286 --> 37:02.788
and I'm the drunk
that let it happen.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.026
(sad music)

37:10.061 --> 37:11.196
(Charles sighs)

37:11.196 --> 37:12.030
I,

37:13.965 --> 37:17.803
you know I so hope that
we can find that monster

37:19.271 --> 37:21.006
who took my grandson.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.380
- Mrs. Bando, how long
has he been like this?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.749
- It started this morning and

37:30.749 --> 37:33.452
he just started to get
worse as the day went on.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.921
- We need to run tests now.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.958
(dark music)

37:41.560 --> 37:43.495
- Oh gosh honey,

37:43.495 --> 37:45.297
oh you're burning up.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.533
(Ben groaning)

37:47.533 --> 37:52.538
(dark music)
(Ben groaning)

38:00.145 --> 38:01.447
- I was curious about Bando

38:01.447 --> 38:04.149
so I tried to find
out a few things.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.318
Our college won't release
very much about him

38:06.318 --> 38:09.355
other than to say he was
quite the history professor.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.557
- And?

38:11.557 --> 38:13.359
- I think he's a liar.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.926
He told Professor Knowles

38:14.926 --> 38:18.129
he wasn't into the Bible,
theology or anything like that.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.198
He's running

38:21.433 --> 38:23.335
or he's hiding.

38:23.335 --> 38:26.572
Listen, I have an idea.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.475
(mysterious music)

38:55.166 --> 38:57.903
(mystical music)

39:03.241 --> 39:04.676
- [Detective Shek] So
back to these glasses,

39:04.676 --> 39:06.578
you're seeing
really weird things.

39:06.578 --> 39:07.713
So then what happened?

39:08.880 --> 39:10.215
- [Monty] Sorry.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.056
- [Tyler] Dude,
what did you lose?

39:18.056 --> 39:19.558
- [Monty] Nothing.

39:21.259 --> 39:25.731
Hey, hey, where'd you
put those glasses?

39:25.731 --> 39:27.232
- [Tyler] They're
in my pocket man.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.935
I told Dreann that I'd show
them to her at the park.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.237
Let her see all the
different colors it makes.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.606
- And other things.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.941
- [Tyler] What?

39:35.941 --> 39:37.375
- Nothing, nothing.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.209
- [Tyler] All right.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.377
- Hey.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.946
- [Tyler] What?

39:40.946 --> 39:45.116
- So after, after, do
you mind if I use 'em?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.051
- [Tyler] I don't know yet.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.119
Are you ready to practice?

39:48.119 --> 39:49.054
- Yeah, don't forget.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.221
We got to rehearse tonight.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.356
- [Tyler] Yeah, I know.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.625
- Right.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.897
By now, I'm obsessed with what
those glasses can really do.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.468
So I decided to test
them out one more time.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.670
So I waited for Tyler to
get back from his date

40:04.670 --> 40:06.304
with that really
hot French girl.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.875
I mean Tyler still
really doesn't know

40:09.875 --> 40:11.943
what those glasses can do.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.946
(mysterious music)

40:22.120 --> 40:24.189
- Wow, what a show.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.057
Check these out.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.064
Well?

40:33.064 --> 40:36.034
- Uh, I just see trees and dirt.

40:37.603 --> 40:42.140
- What?

40:42.140 --> 40:43.775
Well you got to get
your eyes checked

40:43.775 --> 40:45.744
'cause this is amazing.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.579
Look, try again.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.785
- Oh my God.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.423
Oh you're right.

41:02.594 --> 41:03.428
Oh.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.364
- Well it seemed

41:06.364 --> 41:08.500
every time I went to
that convenience store

41:08.500 --> 41:10.235
weird stuff would happen.

41:10.235 --> 41:15.206
So I intentionally brought the
glasses with me just in case.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.943
(ominous music)

41:29.655 --> 41:31.990
Oh um, what'd you do to him?

41:32.891 --> 41:34.092
I'll call the police.

41:35.727 --> 41:36.828
Don't come any closer.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.265
If you're homeless, I'll buy
you a sandwich or something.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.801
The civil war reenactment group
meets monthly at the local,

41:42.801 --> 41:44.335
what did you do to him?

41:44.335 --> 41:45.303
Is he okay?

41:45.303 --> 41:47.005
- Are you a local courier?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.174
Tell Mrs. Steale that Noah,

41:49.174 --> 41:51.943
he fought really bravely
right until the end.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.547
(mysterious music)

41:55.547 --> 41:57.949
- Hey I forgot to ask

41:57.949 --> 42:02.854
what are you presenting as your
hobby or interest for class?

42:03.789 --> 42:04.990
- I will talk about dolls.

42:04.990 --> 42:09.895
- Dolls, that's pretty unique.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.429
- Do you know that dolls making

42:11.429 --> 42:15.767
go all the way back to ancient
Egypt, Greece and Rome?

42:16.668 --> 42:18.369
- I did not know that.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.306
- And started in
15th century Germany?

42:23.041 --> 42:26.745
- That's new to me,
that's very different.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.481
- Not that different
than broken glasses.

42:32.718 --> 42:36.287
- Aren't you maybe
a little worried

42:36.287 --> 42:40.258
that the class will think it's
a little out of the ordinary

42:40.258 --> 42:43.394
that somebody your age
is collecting dolls?

42:43.394 --> 42:45.063
- I knew this really young

42:45.997 --> 42:47.265
that it's less painful

42:47.265 --> 42:49.668
when you don't make
other people opinion

42:49.668 --> 42:51.469
more important than yours.

42:53.138 --> 42:56.274
- You know, a lot of
people pay a lot of money

42:56.274 --> 42:58.309
to learn what you did as a kid.

43:02.113 --> 43:05.116
- I really liked what
you said in class.

43:05.984 --> 43:06.785
- Which was?

43:07.986 --> 43:11.623
- You know the power of
the Lord Jesus Christ.

43:11.623 --> 43:14.993
Wow, this takes
a lot of courage.

43:14.993 --> 43:17.495
- I don't know about courage,

43:17.495 --> 43:19.530
just staying true
to my convictions.

43:21.032 --> 43:24.469
- And this makes
me like you more.

43:32.010 --> 43:32.944
- Okay.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.612
I'll see in class, right?

43:36.982 --> 43:40.085
(cheery piano music)

44:01.172 --> 44:02.073
- Morning, Charles.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.074
How are you today?

44:04.275 --> 44:05.210
- Just fine.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.646
How about yourself?

44:08.646 --> 44:11.016
- You know, I
couldn't be better.

44:14.385 --> 44:16.054
This is a little hard for me,

44:18.556 --> 44:23.561
but I was wondering if maybe
we could go for a cup of coffee

44:25.430 --> 44:26.564
or a drink sometime.

44:30.769 --> 44:35.774
- Well I must say that
I'm really flattered

44:36.875 --> 44:38.676
that such an attractive,
intelligent woman

44:38.676 --> 44:39.911
would be interested in me

44:44.049 --> 44:46.384
but I'm married.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.321
- Oh I'm, I'm sorry.

44:52.590 --> 44:56.027
When I didn't see a
ring on your left hand,

44:56.027 --> 44:58.797
I just thought you
were a free man.

45:06.637 --> 45:09.040
- Well, it's personal reasons

45:14.645 --> 45:16.481
but thanks for asking.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.486
- Bye.

45:21.486 --> 45:24.555
(cheery piano music)

45:42.407 --> 45:43.842
- Good Monday morning all.

45:46.044 --> 45:49.080
Our word for today is death.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.982
And for some that may
bring cold chills,

45:50.982 --> 45:53.919
but to others it
represents a new beginning.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.687
- [Daisy] Yeah right.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.025
- Dad and Daisy at it again.

46:02.227 --> 46:03.328
- [Charles] Would you
like to say something?

46:03.328 --> 46:04.562
- I would.

46:04.562 --> 46:07.032
Why do people have such
a hard time with this?

46:07.032 --> 46:10.735
Why can't they just admit,
lights out, game over?

46:10.735 --> 46:12.370
- Because that's permanent.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.372
Death doesn't
offer much to life.

46:15.706 --> 46:17.909
Jesus knew that we
would fear dying.

46:17.909 --> 46:20.511
That's why he told us that
eternal life would be ours

46:20.511 --> 46:21.679
if we walk in his steps.

46:21.679 --> 46:23.014
- Oh please.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.316
- Look, you can either believe

46:25.316 --> 46:26.885
that all of us are accidental,

46:26.885 --> 46:28.619
meaningless lumps of protoplasm

46:28.619 --> 46:31.122
meandering around with
no purpose or value or,

46:34.592 --> 46:37.528
or that we are created beings
made in the image of God

46:37.528 --> 46:39.130
with an eternal destiny,

46:39.130 --> 46:40.731
with purpose and value,

46:41.933 --> 46:44.135
placed here to fulfill
a divine master plan.

46:47.372 --> 46:49.774
(dark music)

46:51.342 --> 46:53.611
- All right class,
on a lighter note,

46:53.611 --> 46:55.947
are there any
interests or hobbies

46:55.947 --> 46:57.348
that you'd like to disclose?

47:00.251 --> 47:02.988
- I didn't want to leave
my prized glass in a box

47:02.988 --> 47:05.256
so I turned them into glasses.

47:15.901 --> 47:18.569
(ominous music)

47:37.155 --> 47:39.524
Professor, professor,
are you okay?

47:41.492 --> 47:42.827
- Yeah somehow it just,

47:44.362 --> 47:46.965
just sort of made
me a little dizzy.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.967
- [Detective Shek] So Monty,
tell me the first time

47:48.967 --> 47:52.070
you made contact with
Professor Derring.

47:52.070 --> 47:53.571
- Well, after I had

47:53.571 --> 47:55.773
that weird thing happen
at the convenience store,

47:55.773 --> 47:57.642
since I knew he taught physics,

47:57.642 --> 47:59.544
I thought I'd stop
by, pick his brain.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.580
(knocking on door)

48:02.580 --> 48:03.414
- Hold on.

48:05.150 --> 48:05.984
Jesus.

48:08.586 --> 48:11.489
- Hey, I heard you're
a physics teacher.

48:11.489 --> 48:12.323
- Go on.

48:13.658 --> 48:15.560
- I've always been
interested in sound

48:15.560 --> 48:18.763
and what happens to
it when it stops?

48:18.763 --> 48:20.698
- I recognize you now.

48:20.698 --> 48:24.002
You're one of the musicians
from the coffee and wine house.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.370
Look, if you've come here

48:25.370 --> 48:27.572
for me to help you with
a project, I'm too busy.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.174
- No, no that's not it.

48:30.308 --> 48:31.742
I read in one of
the theory journals

48:31.742 --> 48:36.281
that time could be
happening all around us

48:36.281 --> 48:38.849
just at a different pace.

48:38.849 --> 48:40.218
- I'm aware of that theory.

48:41.219 --> 48:43.688
- So theoretically,

48:43.688 --> 48:47.758
something that may have happened
50 or even 100 years ago,

48:47.758 --> 48:50.428
could be happening all
around us now, right?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.529
- That's right.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.631
If the theory's correct.

48:53.631 --> 48:54.865
But it doesn't matter.

48:54.865 --> 48:58.036
There's no way to
prove it or see it.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.504
Did you watch a
movie or something

48:59.504 --> 49:01.606
that got you
thinking about this.

49:01.606 --> 49:04.142
- No, I guess I'm just curious.

49:04.142 --> 49:05.410
- Oh.

49:05.410 --> 49:08.679
- Well, what do you
think it would take

49:08.679 --> 49:10.781
to make the past visible?

49:11.849 --> 49:12.850
- A miracle.

49:14.219 --> 49:15.153
- Thanks professor.

49:18.223 --> 49:23.228
Hey, ever heard of a Noah
Steale from the Civil War?

49:24.295 --> 49:26.264
- Sounds familiar, I'm not sure.

49:27.432 --> 49:31.269
Those are some seriously
funky looking glasses.

49:31.269 --> 49:32.303
Where'd you get them?

49:33.971 --> 49:35.606
- From a friend.

49:35.606 --> 49:37.575
Well hey professor,
I'll see you around.

49:37.575 --> 49:38.876
Thanks again.

49:38.876 --> 49:41.712
(dramatic music)

49:47.385 --> 49:48.553
- Noah Steale?

49:49.887 --> 49:52.657
(dramatic music)

50:02.767 --> 50:04.835
- What is so interesting?

50:06.637 --> 50:07.605
- Just daydreaming.

50:13.378 --> 50:18.015
Hey man, you mind if I
use those glasses later,

50:18.015 --> 50:19.517
just for a bit, I'll be quick?

50:21.819 --> 50:23.621
- I'm gonna start
charging you, man.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.926
Hey, you in love or something?

50:33.431 --> 50:35.533
- No, man, that
would be you, champ.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.603
Just got a lot on
my mind, that's all.

50:39.837 --> 50:42.140
- Alright well, don't
forget we have rehearsal

50:42.140 --> 50:44.875
and if you remember,
we have a gig Friday.

50:44.875 --> 50:45.843
- That's right.

50:45.843 --> 50:47.245
Thank you, I appreciate it.

50:47.245 --> 50:48.045
See ya.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.084
(dramatic music)

50:54.219 --> 50:56.787
- That's who we're waiting for.

50:57.688 --> 50:58.889
- The musician kid?

50:58.889 --> 50:59.690
- That's right.

51:00.958 --> 51:03.728
- And why exactly
are we following him?

51:03.728 --> 51:06.397
- It's just a hunch, but
I think this Monty kid

51:06.397 --> 51:07.765
is seeing Noah Steale.

51:08.866 --> 51:09.800
- Noah Steale.

51:10.968 --> 51:12.603
Who in God's name
is Noah Steale?

51:12.603 --> 51:14.272
- Well that's just it.

51:14.272 --> 51:15.840
You, a college professor,

51:15.840 --> 51:18.943
doesn't know an obscure
local but noble person.

51:18.943 --> 51:21.946
Then how does an out-of-town
21 year old know about him?

51:21.946 --> 51:23.348
- Well maybe met him.

51:23.348 --> 51:26.917
- Perhaps, but he died
over 150 years ago.

51:30.521 --> 51:34.625
- And you made this
fantastical astronomical

51:34.625 --> 51:36.794
leap of logic because?

51:36.794 --> 51:38.163
- I know it sounds crazy but-

51:38.163 --> 51:39.430
- Do you?

51:39.430 --> 51:41.366
- Somehow, I think he's
found a way to see him.

51:44.135 --> 51:44.935
- Okay.

51:48.873 --> 51:52.076
(ominous music)

51:52.076 --> 51:54.779
Guess we're waiting
for Noah Steale, right?

51:54.779 --> 51:56.381
- Bingo.

51:56.381 --> 51:57.848
He's not out here for nothing.

52:01.719 --> 52:06.724
That's it, that's what
I was waiting for.

52:07.592 --> 52:09.059
- [Professor Hanson] It was?

52:11.562 --> 52:13.598
- Young man, how's it going?

52:13.598 --> 52:15.533
- Oh, hey Professor Derring.

52:15.533 --> 52:18.336
- I see you got those dope
looking windows on again.

52:18.336 --> 52:19.804
- Yeah.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.272
- I'll bet the
view is super cool.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.973
Mind if I try 'em on?

52:22.973 --> 52:24.342
- Sure.

52:24.342 --> 52:27.178
(dramatic music)

52:33.451 --> 52:34.552
Pretty cool view, huh?

52:37.955 --> 52:42.627
- Yeah, thanks for
letting me try 'em on.

52:42.627 --> 52:43.828
- Yeah.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.296
Hey, come on out to
Beans and Vines Friday,

52:45.296 --> 52:46.664
we're gonna be playing again.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.266
- I'll try to do that.

52:48.266 --> 52:49.334
You take care.

52:49.334 --> 52:50.568
- Thanks professor.

52:50.568 --> 52:53.404
- Then there was
this grateful night

52:53.404 --> 52:58.376
that I got the call that
no one ever wants to get.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.847
- [Mason] You doing okay?

53:02.847 --> 53:03.848
- What do you think?

53:05.049 --> 53:07.184
- [Mason] Charles, I was
gonna call you next week

53:08.453 --> 53:09.987
but I may as well tell you now.

53:11.656 --> 53:12.490
- What is it?

53:13.891 --> 53:15.760
- [Mason] I got a call
from your son, Ben.

53:17.762 --> 53:19.230
- What'd he say?

53:20.698 --> 53:23.033
- [Mason] They're going ahead
with the declaration of death.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.436
(dark music)

53:33.344 --> 53:34.245
- Mine too.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.020
- The truth is Rob,

53:43.020 --> 53:45.923
you've become a liability
that we can't afford.

53:48.125 --> 53:49.860
- What does that mean?

53:49.860 --> 53:53.531
- We can't afford to
make payments on the
church any longer.

53:53.531 --> 53:56.401
We're gonna bulldoze and
sell the land outright.

53:57.868 --> 54:00.738
It's in a good location so
I'm sure we'll find a buyer.

54:02.807 --> 54:03.808
- You can't do that.

54:05.510 --> 54:06.511
The people will come back,

54:06.511 --> 54:07.812
just give it a little more time.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.281
- I'm afraid we've
run out of time, Rob.

54:11.148 --> 54:12.717
Three years is long enough.

54:16.120 --> 54:16.987
- [Rob] Now what?

54:18.188 --> 54:19.557
- You've got 30 days.

54:21.826 --> 54:25.396
Also, the entire
board is voting.

54:25.396 --> 54:27.865
We will no longer be
supporting you financially.

54:30.368 --> 54:34.505
- We are all very sorry, Rob.

54:34.505 --> 54:38.509
And we thank you so very
much for everything you did.

54:42.547 --> 54:43.981
- That's it.

54:43.981 --> 54:46.417
(dark music)

54:54.859 --> 54:58.228
- I want you to know I've been
praying for you, Reverend,

54:59.129 --> 55:01.332
and I know God has a plan.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.435
- Well, I appreciate
your prayers.

55:05.870 --> 55:09.707
No man of the cloth should
feel as useless as I do.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.315
- Ben, I love you, honey.

55:21.619 --> 55:23.854
Oh I'm so sorry you're
in so much pain.

55:26.290 --> 55:29.794
- Mr. And Mrs. Bando, I
have the test results.

55:32.430 --> 55:35.666
- Yes, he's gonna be okay right?

55:36.834 --> 55:38.403
- Well it looks like
you have some form

55:38.403 --> 55:39.804
of Legionnaires' disease,

55:39.804 --> 55:41.005
which one we don't know.

55:42.272 --> 55:44.108
- What does that mean?

55:44.108 --> 55:45.510
- It's a type of pneumonia.

55:47.077 --> 55:52.082
And there is a possibility
that you could go into a coma

55:52.683 --> 55:53.584
and not recover.

55:54.952 --> 55:55.820
I'm sorry.

55:57.254 --> 55:59.890
But we're doing everything
possible to fight this.

56:02.893 --> 56:05.195
- Everyone encounters tests

56:05.195 --> 56:08.265
where everything they
hold near and dear to them

56:08.265 --> 56:10.200
comes crashing down

56:10.200 --> 56:15.205
and it forces them to
come face to face with us,

56:16.373 --> 56:19.477
our feelings and what
makes us who we are.

56:22.580 --> 56:26.383
Something men in particular
have difficulty dealing with

56:26.383 --> 56:27.452
is feelings.

56:28.653 --> 56:30.020
They're taught all
through childhood

56:30.020 --> 56:32.690
they have to squash
their emotions.

56:32.690 --> 56:34.625
They're told not
to be a cry baby.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.428
And I'm sure with your
military background,

56:37.428 --> 56:38.929
that's especially difficult.

56:42.833 --> 56:44.068
The problem with that

56:44.068 --> 56:47.605
is that God created
those emotions in you.

56:47.605 --> 56:49.674
They're meant to be expressed.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.244
In my opinion,

56:54.244 --> 56:56.481
your experiences over
the last three years

56:56.481 --> 56:59.216
are equivalent to
post-traumatic stress disorder.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.526
(dark music)

57:15.500 --> 57:17.101
- Yes, it has been.

57:21.872 --> 57:22.773
- Call dad.

57:24.809 --> 57:27.377
(Ben groaning)

57:28.513 --> 57:30.280
- Ben I'm sorry honey,
what did you say?

57:33.618 --> 57:35.753
What'd ya say sweetie?

57:35.753 --> 57:37.588
- Call dad.

57:37.588 --> 57:39.924
(sad music)

57:43.961 --> 57:46.196
I want to see him before I go.

57:47.532 --> 57:49.867
(sad music)

57:52.202 --> 57:53.504
It's okay.

57:53.504 --> 57:55.840
(sad music)

58:08.853 --> 58:10.087
- Hello?

58:10.087 --> 58:14.525
- [Leigh] This is your
daughter-in-law, Leigh.

58:14.525 --> 58:17.662
- Hey Leigh, how are you?

58:17.662 --> 58:19.396
- [Leigh] This
isn't a social call.

58:22.633 --> 58:23.467
- Okay.

58:25.703 --> 58:26.537
Where's Ben?

58:28.138 --> 58:29.540
- [Leigh] That's
why I'm calling.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.609
- I know, I mean I know

58:31.609 --> 58:34.712
about the declaration
of death signing.

58:34.712 --> 58:36.113
- [Leigh] Ben wants to talk.

58:40.250 --> 58:41.085
- Okay.

58:42.653 --> 58:45.189
Okay, what's your new address?

58:45.189 --> 58:47.291
- [Leigh] I'll text it to you.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.726
I got to go, bye.

58:59.403 --> 59:02.472
- My son wants to talk
to me after three years.

59:02.472 --> 59:04.942
- See, what did I tell you?

59:04.942 --> 59:07.111
Put that away, go see your son.

59:09.814 --> 59:11.448
- God bless you, Charles.

59:14.318 --> 59:17.788
- I got a text from Leigh

59:18.989 --> 59:21.892
and the address brought
me here to the hospital

59:21.892 --> 59:24.695
so why are you here?

59:26.163 --> 59:27.097
- I don't know.

59:27.097 --> 59:28.933
I got a phone call from someone

59:28.933 --> 59:30.801
who said they needed me here.

59:30.801 --> 59:34.338
- Someone, no name?

59:34.338 --> 59:37.374
- No name but I got
it on the phone.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.214
It's not there.

59:45.215 --> 59:46.416
- Hmm.

59:46.416 --> 59:49.353
(gentle sad music)

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:03.868
- We didn't call you, reverend.

1:00:03.868 --> 1:00:04.969
- [Doctor] I didn't call anyone.

1:00:08.505 --> 1:00:10.574
- He's dying, Charles.

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:14.211
And if it would be
up to Laura and me,

1:00:15.379 --> 1:00:17.915
neither one of us
would've called you.

1:00:17.915 --> 1:00:20.250
(sad music)

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:34.464
- Dad.

1:00:40.938 --> 1:00:42.572
Thanks for coming.

1:00:42.572 --> 1:00:44.474
- Oh, no, I'm the one who-

1:00:44.474 --> 1:00:46.711
- Please, don't say anything.

1:00:50.681 --> 1:00:53.918
I need to talk 'cause
I think I'm dying.

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:57.855
- [Charles] No, no.

1:00:59.056 --> 1:01:00.657
- Don't tell Leigh.

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:11.235
I love you, dad.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.507
You're a good man.

1:01:22.212 --> 1:01:27.217
How stubborn and
unforgiving I was.

1:01:33.090 --> 1:01:37.094
It wasn't your fault.

1:01:37.094 --> 1:01:38.628
It wasn't your fault.

1:01:41.298 --> 1:01:45.169
- Excuse me, Mr. Bando,
he needs to rest now.

1:01:46.670 --> 1:01:47.671
- Okay.

1:01:47.671 --> 1:01:52.642
(Charles crying)
(sad music)

1:02:11.996 --> 1:02:13.430
- You know Charles,

1:02:14.598 --> 1:02:17.501
I thought losing Shay
was enough for one man.

1:02:21.071 --> 1:02:22.272
- I've lost my grandson

1:02:22.272 --> 1:02:27.111
and now it looks like
I'm losing my son.

1:02:29.446 --> 1:02:32.950
(upbeat mysterious music)

1:02:37.788 --> 1:02:39.957
- [Professor Derring]
So far so good.

1:02:39.957 --> 1:02:41.325
- What's that?

1:02:41.325 --> 1:02:42.159
- It's for the kid.

1:02:42.159 --> 1:02:43.360
- What?

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.529
- Relax, it'll just
keep him asleep

1:02:45.529 --> 1:02:47.764
long enough for us to get
ahold of those glasses.

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:49.533
- I don't know about that, JL.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:52.569
- We scientists know
that every experiment

1:02:52.569 --> 1:02:55.372
begins with a
theory, a hypothesis.

1:02:55.372 --> 1:02:58.208
Doesn't necessarily mean
it's scientific or true,

1:02:58.208 --> 1:02:59.609
but it's worth looking into.

1:03:01.011 --> 1:03:02.947
It's what we do.

1:03:02.947 --> 1:03:05.482
Besides, what have
we got to lose?

1:03:05.482 --> 1:03:09.286
- Our jobs, our credibility,
getting thrown in jail.

1:03:09.286 --> 1:03:10.720
Other than that, I mean-

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:11.555
- Wait here.

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:12.656
- JL!

1:03:12.656 --> 1:03:13.490
JL!

1:03:14.624 --> 1:03:15.459
Oh.

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:19.529
(knocking on door)

1:03:25.469 --> 1:03:27.037
- Oh, hey professor.

1:03:27.037 --> 1:03:28.072
Come on in.

1:03:28.072 --> 1:03:28.906
- Thanks.

1:03:30.107 --> 1:03:31.942
- What do I owe the
honor of this visit?

1:03:31.942 --> 1:03:33.177
- I've been thinking

1:03:33.177 --> 1:03:34.912
about the question you
asked me about time.

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:37.314
It's refreshing

1:03:37.314 --> 1:03:39.383
to see students wanting
to expand their knowledge.

1:03:42.786 --> 1:03:44.021
I was close by

1:03:44.021 --> 1:03:46.290
so I thought I'd bring
you the title of a book

1:03:46.290 --> 1:03:48.625
that you might find
interesting on the subject.

1:03:49.693 --> 1:03:50.794
- Thanks.

1:03:50.794 --> 1:03:51.628
- Yeah.

1:03:56.533 --> 1:03:58.502
Y'all have another
gig tonight I see?

1:03:58.502 --> 1:04:00.570
- Yeah, Beans and Vines.

1:04:01.771 --> 1:04:04.141
- Tell me, how did
you get interested

1:04:04.141 --> 1:04:06.911
in the whole space-time
continuum thing?

1:04:08.745 --> 1:04:11.481
- I guess I just
kinda stumbled on it.

1:04:11.481 --> 1:04:12.883
- Yeah.

1:04:12.883 --> 1:04:15.119
- Well hey professor,

1:04:15.119 --> 1:04:18.388
I got to go, I'm gonna
be late for the show.

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:19.623
- Oh, oh yeah sure,

1:04:19.623 --> 1:04:22.126
I won't take any
more of your time.

1:04:22.126 --> 1:04:23.160
Hey, good luck tonight.

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:24.761
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

1:04:24.761 --> 1:04:28.298
- Um, maybe I'll see you there.

1:04:28.298 --> 1:04:29.333
- [Monty] Yeah, yeah.

1:04:30.767 --> 1:04:33.403
- So how many
members in your band?

1:04:34.838 --> 1:04:38.142
- It's just a few, it's just
me and Tyler from school.

1:04:38.142 --> 1:04:39.409
- [Professor Derring] All
right, have fun tonight.

1:04:39.409 --> 1:04:40.777
- [Monty] Thank you.

1:04:40.777 --> 1:04:43.713
(mysterious music)

1:04:49.019 --> 1:04:50.154
- Well, you get them?

1:04:51.521 --> 1:04:54.058
- Another couple of
minutes I would have.

1:04:54.058 --> 1:04:56.493
I forgot to factor in
his youth and fitness.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.669
(ominous music)

1:05:08.605 --> 1:05:12.176
Title of a book you
might find interesting.

1:05:12.176 --> 1:05:14.911
(ominous music)

1:05:21.851 --> 1:05:23.954
- Looks like a tracing.

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:26.957
(mysterious music)

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:35.899
(gentle guitar music)

1:05:38.302 --> 1:05:42.306
* A good time is all we
need to have a good life *

1:05:42.306 --> 1:05:45.875
(audience applauding)

1:05:45.875 --> 1:05:46.876
- Thank you, thank you.

1:05:46.876 --> 1:05:48.078
I'm gonna take a short break.

1:05:48.078 --> 1:05:50.847
I'm sure my better
half will be here soon.

1:05:54.551 --> 1:05:56.886
Professor, thank you
so much for coming.

1:05:56.886 --> 1:05:58.122
I'm solo right now

1:05:58.122 --> 1:06:00.290
but I think you'll
like this next song.

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:03.293
- [Charles] I'm sure
it's gonna be great.

1:06:03.293 --> 1:06:05.095
- Yeah, all right,
here we go again.

1:06:06.430 --> 1:06:09.166
I wrote this song
with my friend, Monty.

1:06:09.166 --> 1:06:11.101
- Tyler, can I see you?

1:06:13.570 --> 1:06:16.173
- Just a few moments, people.

1:06:16.173 --> 1:06:19.076
(gentle sad music)

1:06:37.261 --> 1:06:42.199
* If you think that you
have lost your way *

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:53.410
* All you feel inside
are clouds of gray *

1:07:00.250 --> 1:07:04.288
* Let me tell you
what I learned *

1:07:06.823 --> 1:07:10.060
- You seemed really
tired, professor.

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:13.730
- Yeah, I've been driving out
of town several nights a week

1:07:13.730 --> 1:07:17.267
because I have a person
that I'm very close to

1:07:17.267 --> 1:07:19.236
that's in the hospital.

1:07:19.236 --> 1:07:20.704
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1:07:20.704 --> 1:07:22.239
I'll make sure to say a prayer.

1:07:23.573 --> 1:07:25.375
- What do you think happened?

1:07:25.375 --> 1:07:26.476
- I really don't know.

1:07:27.677 --> 1:07:31.081
Last two weeks, he's
been very secretive.

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:37.020
- You think it's psychological?

1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:38.988
- No, no, I don't
think it's that.

1:07:40.424 --> 1:07:44.094
He's been very possessive
of those glasses I made.

1:07:44.094 --> 1:07:46.530
I hardly got the
chance to use them.

1:07:46.530 --> 1:07:47.531
- Is that it?

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:52.302
- He said he had to deliver
a message for some guy named

1:07:53.370 --> 1:07:54.204
Noah Steale.

1:07:55.505 --> 1:07:56.506
(ominous music)

1:07:56.506 --> 1:07:57.341
- Noah Steale.

1:07:58.575 --> 1:07:59.909
- Anyway.

1:07:59.909 --> 1:08:02.512
(ominous music)

1:08:31.675 --> 1:08:34.511
I overheard some of the nurses

1:08:34.511 --> 1:08:36.513
and they're not positive.

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:50.059
- Would you like us
to pray together?

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:58.502
- Honestly professor,
I'm all out of prayers.

1:09:03.540 --> 1:09:05.541
- I was wondering if
you happened to know

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:08.878
where your uncle picked
up that piece of glass

1:09:08.878 --> 1:09:10.180
that he mailed to you?

1:09:14.283 --> 1:09:17.020
- I don't know,
Middle East, why?

1:09:20.156 --> 1:09:23.693
- But just curious, any
place in particular?

1:09:26.630 --> 1:09:27.464
- I don't know.

1:09:31.166 --> 1:09:32.769
Jerusalem maybe,

1:09:32.769 --> 1:09:36.706
I think it said something,
the place of the skull.

1:09:43.846 --> 1:09:47.851
- All right I'll see you soon.

1:09:53.823 --> 1:09:55.759
- Lot of people
worried about you.

1:09:55.759 --> 1:09:59.162
Your buddy Tyler, your
schoolmates, Professor Bando,

1:09:59.162 --> 1:10:01.030
all the people at
Beans and Vines.

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:05.934
- Monty, where
are those glasses?

1:10:05.934 --> 1:10:08.672
(dramatic music)

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:19.883
- [Doctor] Hello, Mr. Bando?

1:10:19.883 --> 1:10:21.117
- [Charles] Yes.

1:10:21.117 --> 1:10:22.852
I'm Dr. Fernandez at
St. Joseph's Hospital.

1:10:22.852 --> 1:10:24.087
- [Charles] Okay.

1:10:24.087 --> 1:10:24.888
- [Doctor] I promised
to keep you updated

1:10:24.888 --> 1:10:26.456
on your son's condition.

1:10:26.456 --> 1:10:27.957
- [Charles] Yeah, how is he?

1:10:27.957 --> 1:10:29.626
- [Doctor] Well, I hate
to have to tell you this,

1:10:29.626 --> 1:10:32.462
but this morning he
slipped into a coma.

1:10:32.462 --> 1:10:35.130
(ominous music)

1:10:54.418 --> 1:10:57.053
(hopeful music)

1:11:18.907 --> 1:11:20.510
- Hey, where's dad?

1:11:22.612 --> 1:11:23.513
- Ben, Ben.

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:32.621
Oh baby.

1:11:32.621 --> 1:11:35.359
(ethereal music)

1:12:05.989 --> 1:12:08.657
(ominous music)

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:32.449
- Detective, this is Charles.

1:12:32.449 --> 1:12:34.083
I need you to listen
and don't interrupt.

1:12:34.083 --> 1:12:35.585
I need you to run these plates

1:12:35.585 --> 1:12:37.687
and find out who they belong to.

1:12:37.687 --> 1:12:41.324
South Carolina JTV 2656.

1:12:41.324 --> 1:12:44.428
Also, I need you to get Barry
Crane back in for questioning.

1:12:45.762 --> 1:12:50.166
I know, I know, but technically
he didn't kidnap Shay,

1:12:50.166 --> 1:12:51.901
he had someone else do it.

1:12:54.538 --> 1:12:57.173
- [Male] Hey Gills, I'm
gonna take him to number one.

1:12:59.643 --> 1:13:02.210
(upbeat music)

1:13:07.851 --> 1:13:08.752
- [Charles] Hello?

1:13:10.186 --> 1:13:12.556
- [Detective] Charles, I
don't know how you did it,

1:13:12.556 --> 1:13:15.358
but we did find the
owner of that vehicle.

1:13:15.358 --> 1:13:17.026
He lived by himself.

1:13:17.026 --> 1:13:18.528
- [Charles] Great.

1:13:22.699 --> 1:13:25.602
- [Detective] But he died of
a heart attack 18 months ago.

1:13:28.404 --> 1:13:32.241
But Charles, we know
where Barry Crane is.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:35.044
Can you believe he only moved
50 miles from the church?

1:13:37.581 --> 1:13:39.048
Charles, are you there?

1:13:41.818 --> 1:13:42.619
- I am.

1:13:43.753 --> 1:13:44.688
- [Detective] Let's go find out

1:13:44.688 --> 1:13:47.023
what happened to your grandson.

1:13:47.023 --> 1:13:48.758
Go to this address
and wait for me.

1:13:49.993 --> 1:13:50.994
Wait for me.

1:13:54.698 --> 1:13:56.666
- [Charles] Great,
I'll be ready.

1:14:00.603 --> 1:14:02.038
Professor Bando?

1:14:02.038 --> 1:14:02.839
- [Murch] This is Chief
Detective Murch calling back.

1:14:02.839 --> 1:14:04.340
- Oh yeah, hey Chief.

1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:05.575
- [Murch] I understand you
know Professor Derring?

1:14:05.575 --> 1:14:08.111
- Sure, I know
Professor Derring.

1:14:08.111 --> 1:14:10.213
- [Murch] We arrested him
for drugging Monty Lawrence.

1:14:10.213 --> 1:14:11.047
- Really?

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:16.285
- Okay Derring, I need to
know what you were doing

1:14:16.285 --> 1:14:17.487
at that kid's apartment.

1:14:22.692 --> 1:14:25.094
You weren't the last
person he had contact with.

1:14:27.096 --> 1:14:30.299
So did you or did you
not slip him that drug?

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:31.535
- I told you everything.

1:14:32.969 --> 1:14:35.672
I brought him a book on
the space time continuum.

1:14:37.139 --> 1:14:37.974
- Is that right?

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:38.808
- That's right.

1:14:42.011 --> 1:14:43.412
- I'm trying to be nice here

1:14:44.848 --> 1:14:46.883
so let me ask you one last time,

1:14:47.916 --> 1:14:49.853
did you or did you not

1:14:49.853 --> 1:14:52.789
slip Monte that drug while
you were in his apartment?

1:14:52.789 --> 1:14:53.623
- No!

1:14:55.725 --> 1:14:57.827
- You really must think
I'm pretty stupid.

1:15:00.597 --> 1:15:03.199
You should know that when
I'm asking the question

1:15:03.199 --> 1:15:04.968
that I've already
done my homework.

1:15:06.434 --> 1:15:08.337
You see Derring,

1:15:08.337 --> 1:15:10.073
we have a sworn affidavit

1:15:10.073 --> 1:15:12.609
from your colleague
Professor Hanson

1:15:12.609 --> 1:15:16.646
that says you indeed did slip
that drug into his drink.

1:15:18.648 --> 1:15:21.951
So care to revise your story?

1:15:33.697 --> 1:15:34.898
- You ready, Charles?

1:15:45.809 --> 1:15:48.544
(dramatic music)

1:16:03.425 --> 1:16:06.562
Look, I know you're
worked up over this.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:07.496
You're gonna have
to play it cool

1:16:07.496 --> 1:16:09.332
if this is gonna go right.

1:16:09.332 --> 1:16:10.900
- He kidnapped my grandson.

1:16:11.835 --> 1:16:13.803
- Drive this thing like a pro.

1:16:15.171 --> 1:16:17.907
(dramatic music)

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:35.391
Now Charles, don't ask me why

1:16:35.391 --> 1:16:36.592
but I had a strange feeling

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:38.294
you were gonna
show up here today.

1:16:43.867 --> 1:16:45.902
I know you won't understand, but

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:48.805
I got no one.

1:16:50.306 --> 1:16:55.278
I mean I wanted a
family too, a son,

1:16:55.278 --> 1:16:57.981
a son that loves me

1:16:57.981 --> 1:16:59.615
the way your son loves you,

1:16:59.615 --> 1:17:01.384
the way your grandson loves you.

1:17:03.853 --> 1:17:08.858
Charles, I swear, I
swear I never hurt him.

1:17:09.993 --> 1:17:12.295
I never laid a hand on him.

1:17:13.996 --> 1:17:14.964
I swear, Charles.

1:17:16.900 --> 1:17:17.734
I'm so sorry.

1:17:20.969 --> 1:17:23.172
- Grandaddy!

1:17:23.172 --> 1:17:25.108
- Barry Crane,
you're under arrest

1:17:25.108 --> 1:17:26.776
for the abduction of Shay Bando.

1:17:27.977 --> 1:17:29.913
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:17:29.913 --> 1:17:31.047
Anything you say

1:17:31.047 --> 1:17:32.716
can and will be used against you

1:17:32.716 --> 1:17:34.383
in the court of law.

1:17:37.053 --> 1:17:39.388
(sad music)

1:17:47.697 --> 1:17:49.365
- Shay.

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:50.199
Shay.

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:52.468
Shay.

1:17:52.468 --> 1:17:53.302
- Shay.

1:17:54.337 --> 1:17:59.308
(emotional music)
(crying)

1:17:59.943 --> 1:18:01.010
My baby.

1:18:01.010 --> 1:18:03.913
(emotional music)

1:18:22.231 --> 1:18:24.968
(dramatic music)

1:18:48.992 --> 1:18:51.594
(gentle music)

1:18:58.401 --> 1:19:00.804
- I'll call you
right back, thanks.

1:19:02.271 --> 1:19:04.573
Well look at you.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:06.109
You look-

1:19:06.109 --> 1:19:08.477
- Happier, vindicated?

1:19:08.477 --> 1:19:10.013
- All that and a bag of chips.

1:19:12.681 --> 1:19:14.784
- I just came by
to say thank you.

1:19:15.718 --> 1:19:17.320
- You're welcome.

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:19.621
I'm glad I could be of help.

1:19:19.621 --> 1:19:21.057
You remember what I told you?

1:19:22.791 --> 1:19:23.960
- You got it.

1:19:25.261 --> 1:19:26.728
All the best, Dr. Weber.

1:19:28.297 --> 1:19:29.365
- You as well.

1:19:31.567 --> 1:19:32.869
- Take care.

1:19:32.869 --> 1:19:35.538
(gentle music)

1:19:49.785 --> 1:19:50.719
- Hello Charles.

1:19:50.719 --> 1:19:52.721
It's so good to be home.

1:19:54.290 --> 1:19:57.293
- Well, we are so
delighted to host.

1:20:00.930 --> 1:20:01.998
Good morning.

1:20:07.871 --> 1:20:10.539
- Everything's fine
but there's no music.

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:14.377
- Well look who
the cat dragged in.

1:20:15.544 --> 1:20:18.181
I think our music
problem is over.

1:20:18.181 --> 1:20:20.850
I'm so glad to see you all.

1:20:20.850 --> 1:20:23.585
Honey, these are
some of my students.

1:20:23.585 --> 1:20:25.754
In fact, these are the
ones that I told you about.

1:20:25.754 --> 1:20:27.290
This is Tyler

1:20:27.290 --> 1:20:28.157
and this is Dreann.

1:20:28.157 --> 1:20:29.592
This is my wife.

1:20:29.592 --> 1:20:31.794
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1:20:31.794 --> 1:20:33.429
- And our grandson, Shay.

1:20:33.429 --> 1:20:34.864
- Good to meet you.
- Glad to meet you.

1:20:34.864 --> 1:20:37.032
Dreann, glad to meet you.

1:20:38.134 --> 1:20:38.968
- Excuse me for one second.

1:20:38.968 --> 1:20:39.768
- Sure.

1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:45.574
- Hello?

1:20:45.574 --> 1:20:48.177
- [Bill] This is
Tyler Samuels right?

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:51.480
Hey Tyler, my name
is Bill Gentry.

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:54.050
- Okay yeah, what
can I do for you?

1:20:55.284 --> 1:20:56.852
- [Bill] I'd love
to meet you guys.

1:20:58.287 --> 1:21:00.924
I think it'd be
great for us to meet.

1:21:00.924 --> 1:21:04.227
- Okay I really appreciate that.

1:21:04.227 --> 1:21:09.232
- [Bill] And see if we
can do something together.

1:21:09.232 --> 1:21:12.135
I happened to be in town
a couple of weeks ago

1:21:12.135 --> 1:21:17.139
and I visited the Beans
and Vines Coffee Shop,

1:21:18.007 --> 1:21:19.943
coffee and wine shop there

1:21:19.943 --> 1:21:23.512
and you and your partner
there were singing

1:21:23.512 --> 1:21:26.215
and I got to say, I hear

1:21:29.684 --> 1:21:31.287
and...

1:21:31.287 --> 1:21:33.957
(country music)

1:22:10.459 --> 1:22:13.629
(audience applauding)

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:24.707
(ominous music)

1:23:36.545 --> 1:23:39.715
(dark ethereal music)

1:24:36.205 --> 1:24:38.941
(ominous music)
