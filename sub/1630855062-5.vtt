WEBVTT

00:09.260 --> 00:10.845
2820 and 1611,
you have visitors.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.347
<i>2820 and 1611.</i>

00:15.933 --> 00:17.852
All right, time's up. Let's go.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.147
Really? You started without me?

00:21.147 --> 00:23.899
- Take them. They're stale.
- Hey,

00:23.899 --> 00:25.401
to me, they're like
the black and whites

00:25.401 --> 00:27.194
from William Greenberg.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.905
So, what's new?
Who's shanking who?

00:29.905 --> 00:32.074
Please, the only battles in here

00:32.074 --> 00:33.826
are over sections
of the <i>Financial Times.</i>

00:33.826 --> 00:36.787
- Yeah.
- My kingdom for a fistfight.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.248
- What's that?
- The headshots you asked for.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.459
- Oh, you remembered.
- Imogene remembered.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.377
I didn't personalize them,
but if you give me names,

00:43.377 --> 00:44.962
- I'm happy to.
- Oh.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.088
Oh? What's with the "oh"?

00:46.088 --> 00:48.299
- You got any older ones?
- Older ones?

00:48.299 --> 00:49.383
Yeah, like, from the USO?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.177
The panty pose? You're kidding.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.261
I think that'll
be better for what

00:52.261 --> 00:53.345
the guys are gonna use 'em for.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.764
They're gonna jerk off to them?

00:54.764 --> 00:56.390
They ain't casting
the spring musical.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.143
- And they can't
jerk off to this?
- They can.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.978
Of course they can.
I look fucking amazing.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.564
Hey, buddy,
this doing anything for you?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.983
- Midge.
- Fine. Give me those back.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.486
I'll have Imogene dig up
the USO shots,

01:08.486 --> 01:10.112
and I'll bring them
next month, okay?

01:10.112 --> 01:11.947
Thank you for your service.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.532
I'm a little nervous now
about showing you

01:13.532 --> 01:15.242
this next picture.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.080
Aw, little Rose on the kibbutz.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.625
Wearing vertical
and horizontal stripes.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.960
My mother is rolling over
in her grave.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.170
Tell her she'll meet
her grandfather

01:26.170 --> 01:27.838
in four to six months,
with good behavior.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.132
Just what every little girl
wants to hear.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.511
- Hey, question.
- Yeah?

01:33.511 --> 01:35.513
- Why do you keep coming here?
- For the pat-downs.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.680
You shouldn't
be able to come here.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.765
You should be out on the road.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.391
I need to buy new luggage first.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.559
You should be performing.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.061
- I am.
- You're selling wigs.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.230
I'm selling high-quality dreams.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.356
Of having more hair.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.816
I'm diversifying.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.400
Aren't you always
telling me to do that?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.569
I thought you'd be pleased.
Do you know how much I'm making

01:50.569 --> 01:51.737
- on this wig line?
- Susie...

01:51.737 --> 01:53.322
- Don't.
- She would hate this.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.907
I don't really care
what Susie would think.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.784
- Look, I'm just saying...
- And I'm just saying

01:56.784 --> 01:58.327
I can take care of myself.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.412
You don't have to always
be looking out for me.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.664
I like looking out for you.

02:01.664 --> 02:02.873
And look where that got you.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.209
Holy shit.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.877
Here's another one.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.255
This place is really
crawling with them.

02:09.255 --> 02:10.673
Temples, you get
one Star of David.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.967
Somehow, it still gets
the point across.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.845
Don't worry, we'll just
rip her right out of there.
What?

02:15.845 --> 02:17.680
And it'll be done

02:17.680 --> 02:19.807
with the utmost respect
and care, Reverend Mother.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.517
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.103
You got rebar in here,
Reverend Mother?

02:24.103 --> 02:26.647
In all these columns?
What's
rebar?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.190
You gonna help me
out here or what?

02:28.190 --> 02:31.861
There it is.
St. Xavier's School for Boys.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.654
I got nuns staring daggers.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.699
I went in a boy,
came out a broken soul.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.368
And look at you now,
turning it into a supper club

02:39.368 --> 02:40.870
and about to make
a mountain of cash.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.413
That's my kind of broken soul.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.915
The rulers were always new.
Where did the old ones go?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.542
Look at the ceiling.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.794
That's what the Reverend Mother
said whenever she smacked me.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.379
Great ceiling.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.131
- This was your idea.
- I know.

02:52.131 --> 02:55.342
And it was a great idea.
This room, with a stage?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.469
And they've already got
a kitchen and a parking lot,

02:57.469 --> 02:58.762
so people can drive in
from Jersey.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.347
- I know.
- A parking lot, Arch.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.474
- I know.
- We've been looking for a place
like this for months.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.310
- I know!
- But if you're gonna have
a nervous breakdown

03:04.310 --> 03:06.186
- every time you come here...
- No, I won't.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.147
I'm fine. Honest. Run.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.940
Because we'd have to
start all over.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.567
Places like this
are few and far between.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.402
You sure you don't want
to take me out to that place

03:13.402 --> 03:14.820
you scoped out
in the East Village?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.156
- You were so excited about it.
- Nope. It's jinxed.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.283
The minute I stepped in
and spotted Susie's two goons

03:19.283 --> 03:20.743
from that
waste management show...

03:20.743 --> 03:22.870
- I remember this cabinet.
- I don't like those guys.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.246
I used to hide in this cabinet.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.581
If they're around Susie,
then they're around Midge.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.665
I don't want 'em around Midge.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.750
I wonder if I could still fit.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.002
- Archie, stop.
- You stop.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.795
You've been obsessing
over those guys for weeks.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.047
Because they're
fucking mobsters.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.131
Have you talked
to Midge about them?

03:34.131 --> 03:36.425
No. I'm trying
not to be the bad guy

03:36.425 --> 03:37.718
every time I talk to her.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.970
But you're driving
yourself crazy. Talk to her.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.555
She'll appreciate your concern.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.515
- Would you...
- Aah!
- Archie.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.935
I'm sorry, Reverend Mother.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.103
I see you still haven't learned
to straighten your tie.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.148
Would you both like
to stay for tea?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.983
Well, Reverend Mother,

03:52.983 --> 03:55.402
that's a very kind offer,
but we have to get going.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.863
You can take the tea away,
Sister Clementine.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.990
They won't be staying. Oh,
you heard

03:59.990 --> 04:02.451
I'm a disaster with a teapot?

04:02.451 --> 04:03.994
Uh, no.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.413
Clementine, was it?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.748
Are you flirting with a nun?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.916
She's flirting with me.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.000
Nuns don't flirt.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.336
Do you like honey in your tea?

04:12.336 --> 04:14.838
- Holy shit, she is.
- You know,

04:14.838 --> 04:17.091
however you like to make it
is how I like to take it.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.218
Oh, my God.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.720
You know, we're gonna turn this
into a supper club,

04:21.720 --> 04:24.723
so don't go giving up fun
for Lent.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.143
I do like music and dancing.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.355
Father, forgive me.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.731
You tell her it's

04:32.731 --> 04:35.234
Susie Myerson
and Associates calling.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.569
Who am I?
Why, are you gonna propose?

04:37.569 --> 04:38.988
Just give her the message.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.324
S-O-N. Myerson. Nothing fancy.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.077
And she has the number.
Yes, okay, goodbye.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.579
Excuse me, can I just
drop this off for Ms. Myerson?

04:47.579 --> 04:49.581
- Bin.
- Do you ever look through this?

04:49.581 --> 04:50.749
- It's full.
- Yes, dear.

04:50.749 --> 04:51.959
We look through the bin.
That's our job.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.127
There's dust on them.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.128
Then yours
will really stand out.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.295
Thank you for your materials.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.839
We look forward
to reviewing them. Good morning.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.216
I'm calling from Susie Myerson
and Associates for Ms. Dyer.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.051
Sure, I'll hold.
Excuse me, I need you

05:01.051 --> 05:02.428
to wait in line outside
with everyone else.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.221
Five minutes, I swear.
I'm the next Mort Sahl.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.973
In the line, Mort. Okay,
could I leave a message, then?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.559
Is that her in there?
Hey, Ms. Myerson.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.477
Shelly Liebenthal.
I got a tight five.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.271
Dinah, please. We got to close
this fucking door

05:12.271 --> 05:13.564
so these losers can't see me.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.566
They're not losers,
they're potential clients.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.401
She's smaller than I pictured. Alfie.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.986
You're killing me, you know
that? You're killing me.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.529
You sound upset.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.989
You bought
a fucking llama.
- And?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.033
- Why?
<i>- Why does
anyone buy a llama?</i>

05:24.033 --> 05:25.409
For my act, of course.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.369
Her name is Catherine,
by the way.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.954
<i>- I don't care.</i>
- Well, she does.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.206
I am looking at a $2,000
room service bill.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.584
I know you don't eat, so I'm
gonna assume this is Catherine.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.753
I always remind her
the salad is entrée sized,

05:35.753 --> 05:36.754
but she just won't listen.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.505
And the shitting.
It's got to stop.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.466
<i>I sincerely hope
you're talking about her now.</i>

05:40.466 --> 05:42.342
The Orpheum's pissed.
They sent a bill.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.886
They're gonna have to change
the carpet.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.888
Oh, dear.
I'll speak to Catherine.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.639
Just get her a crate, huh?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.349
And if you see her start
to squat, abracadabra,

05:49.349 --> 05:50.559
make it disappear.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.853
She's feeling judged.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.146
Goodbye.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.774
Just rent a llama.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.567
Hey, Dinah, we got her yet?

05:58.567 --> 05:59.818
Still leaving messages.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.988
Keep trying. Maggie!
Nothing.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.741
Don't look so worried, huh?
You'll get wrinkles.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.409
It's been a week.
Why haven't we heard?

06:07.409 --> 06:10.079
This is how it goes
with these Hollywood fucks.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.706
This part--
this is my part, Susie.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.917
I can feel it. I've never wanted
anything more in my life.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.418
Believe me, I know.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.795
You haven't shut up
about it for two months.

06:17.795 --> 06:18.796
You're driving me crazy.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.380
They must've hated me.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.800
You wouldn't have gotten three
callbacks if they hated you.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.510
"Her name was Diana,
but I knew her as DiDi."

06:24.510 --> 06:26.678
Do not do the scene for me
again. I will kill you

06:26.678 --> 06:28.472
if you do that scene
for me again.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.973
Susie, I got her!
- Maggie's got her!

06:29.973 --> 06:31.934
See? We got her.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.273
You go. You stay, you stay,

06:38.273 --> 06:40.484
you stay, you go, you go.
What?

06:40.484 --> 06:44.113
Do me a favor,
find out if the voice is real.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.115
Helen. Susie Myerson.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.616
Thanks so much
for getting back to us.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.910
I've owed money to people
who call me less than you do.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.829
What a nice
personal anecdote.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.747
I am calling about my client,
James Howard.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.666
James is terrific.
A genuine talent.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.918
- <i>I adore James.</i>
- I appreciate the love,

06:57.918 --> 06:59.378
but how about an answer?

06:59.378 --> 07:00.587
<i>Soon as I have one.</i>

07:00.587 --> 07:02.297
Helen, is he still
in the running or not?

07:02.297 --> 07:05.008
- <i>He is.</i>
- Mm. And how many others
is he running with?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.093
You know I can't tell you that.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.761
You like hearing your phone
ring all day, Helen?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.429
Jesus. If managing
doesn't work out,

07:09.429 --> 07:11.849
you got a real future
as a union boss.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.810
- <i>It's between him
and one other.</i>
- Who is it? Dick Gregory?

07:14.810 --> 07:17.563
- <i>It's Dick Gregory, right?</i>
- Look, Ms. Myerson,
if it were up to me...

07:17.563 --> 07:18.856
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I-It's not up to you?

07:18.856 --> 07:19.857
Who's it up to?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.441
The producer, David Weston.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.402
So, what I'm hearing
is you have no power here?

07:23.402 --> 07:24.570
Well, that's not exactly...

07:24.570 --> 07:26.071
It's all about
this David Weston?

07:26.071 --> 07:27.281
I'm very important
in an advi...

07:27.281 --> 07:29.283
Goodbye.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.535
David Weston.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.914
What the hell?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.916
I don't know. She just
walked in and fell asleep.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.543
- Miriam?
- Hi. I'm ready.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.044
When's the last time you slept?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.588
On the walk over.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.006
You know, you don't
have to work all day,

07:44.006 --> 07:45.090
then do a gig
every night, right?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.467
Every night. Got to stay sharp.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.635
You've got a day job.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.221
Here, open a vein,

07:51.221 --> 07:53.015
- pour this in.
- What'd she say?

07:53.015 --> 07:54.808
She loves you, you're
in the running, but it's not

07:54.808 --> 07:56.101
her decision,
it's the producer's.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.394
So, what should I do?

07:57.394 --> 07:58.770
I'm not good at waiting
around like this. I...

07:58.770 --> 07:59.980
Find a club, tell a joke,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.274
and don't come back here
until I call you.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.611
Hey! Don't you have work?

08:05.611 --> 08:07.029
Is it morning or night?

08:07.029 --> 08:09.072
- Still morning.
- I got to get to work.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.200
- Where am I tonight, Dinah?
- Refer to the board, Midge.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.367
Which one am I?

08:12.367 --> 08:13.827
Look for your initials.
We've been through this.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.245
Yes, but there are two "M-M's."

08:15.245 --> 08:17.623
You are little "m-m."
Morty Minsk is the big "M-M."

08:17.623 --> 08:19.750
Why aren't I the big "M-M"?
I was here before Morty.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.293
I figured you'd want
to be more petite.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.920
Well, I do appreciate
that, Dinah,

08:22.920 --> 08:24.755
but can you also make your
big M's and your little m's

08:24.755 --> 08:26.006
look a little more different?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.466
The other night I showed up
for Morty's spot

08:27.466 --> 08:28.926
at The Bitter End,
and let me tell you,

08:28.926 --> 08:30.636
none of us liked that jazz set.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.762
How about you just
write "Midge"?

08:31.762 --> 08:33.305
I can't fit five letters.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.474
That would be too squished.
What about two little hearts?

08:35.474 --> 08:36.934
Oh, that would be cute.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.894
Will you just get your
two little hearts out of here

08:38.894 --> 08:40.896
and go focus on your day job.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.482
Is it morning or night?

08:43.482 --> 08:45.067
Battle station, girls,

08:45.067 --> 08:48.528
because we have a new target:
David Weston.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.364
Steak dinner to the first one
who gets him on the phone.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.907
On it.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.242
Could I get a baked potato?

08:53.242 --> 08:55.118
A steak dinner comes
with a baked potato, Maggie.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.079
Just the baked potato.
I don't need the steak.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.705
So don't eat the steak.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.707
Can't I just order the potato?
It seems like a waste of cow.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.668
You know what? Dinner's off.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.962
Just find David Weston.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.171
Okay, Midge, take your pick.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.048
The solar system
that's missing Earth

09:08.048 --> 09:09.216
or the volcano I dropped

09:09.216 --> 09:11.260
coming out of the subway
just now. Sorry.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.720
I don't know. They both
look like a "B," "B-plus."

09:13.720 --> 09:15.305
This is Ethan
we're talking about here.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.556
Hm...

09:18.976 --> 09:20.435
That's a solid "D-plus"
right there.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.312
Sold.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.856
- So nice of you to join us.
- Ooh.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.775
Didn't realize Johnnie Walker
made an aftershave.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.485
Don't shout. Everything hurts.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.446
- Where were you last night?
- Down at 15th Street.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.782
I did a 7:00 set for the
doorman and the waitress.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.242
Yeesh.
Yeesh, indeed.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.286
Until last night,
I'd never been heckled

09:37.286 --> 09:39.413
by the sound of a napkin
being folded.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.290
Oh, Midge, Reuben Salazar

09:41.290 --> 09:43.834
went on after me
and did your garter belt joke.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.461
Fucking Reuben.
Why steal that joke?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.505
- It doesn't even work
for a guy.
- He did a voice.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.090
I want to punch him in the face.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.968
Now, now, don't go doing that.
Let us punch him in the face.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.470
You fold up all five fingers,
right? That's a fist?

09:55.470 --> 09:57.306
Gordon wants to talk
about the monologue.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.975
- We haven't written it yet.
- He has ideas. Chop, chop.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.727
Ay yi yi.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.729
They're big fans of the show.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.856
- So was Ed Gein.
- Oh, come on, Gordy.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.357
He was. He sent letters
from the madhouse.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.442
They were deeply upsetting,

10:08.442 --> 10:09.776
but not nearly
as upsetting as this.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.820
- Who's Ed Gein?
- They based <i>Psycho</i> on him.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.946
He wore people's skin.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.031
Oh, my goodness.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.282
Nice to know
he's tuning in.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.492
Does that count
as two Nielsen views?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.037
Did stuff with the bones, too.
Made necklaces.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.997
I don't want to know
what he made purses from.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.999
Let's table this, guys,
and get to the monologue.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.667
Our topics lately--
the whole feel--

10:25.667 --> 10:27.919
it's-it's off.
Any specifics, boss?

10:27.919 --> 10:30.464
We're coming down awfully hard
on Debbie Reynolds lately.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.882
Mel? Anything you want
to add to that?

10:31.882 --> 10:34.259
- Left that wide open for you.
- Rain check.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.886
Hedy's feeling there's a little
too much women-bashing going on,

10:35.886 --> 10:37.220
so let's rethink this.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.930
Oh, maybe we can finally
get Debbie on the show.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.433
I'm sorry.
Why are you in here, Mike?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.518
- What?
- You're never
in these meetings.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.354
I've been in these meetings
for the last five years, George.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.023
George, don't abuse Mike when
the person you're mad at is me.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.025
You? Why would I ever
be mad at you?

10:50.025 --> 10:51.818
George is absolutely furious
with me

10:51.818 --> 10:53.862
'cause I don't want to say the
words "Diddy Doo Diaper Cream"

10:53.862 --> 10:55.739
on the show, or anywhere.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.865
I shouldn't have
even said it just now.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.492
Okay, but you can't do a show

10:58.492 --> 11:00.243
without sponsors,
not last time I checked.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.120
We have sponsors.
Great sponsors.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.247
Chevy's a sponsor. I can talk
all night about Chevy.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.416
Well, Diddy Doo outbid Chevy.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.043
They're hungry.
They want to make a mark.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.711
They can make their mark
on someone else's show.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.296
You wanted to revamp the set.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.131
This'll pay for it,
and then some.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.509
Then I'll keep the set.
It's been a lucky set.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.802
Coming down hard
on Debbie Reynolds?

11:16.802 --> 11:18.345
Who are we,
her new husband's bookie?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.472
Good to have you back, Mel.
Diddy Doo

11:20.472 --> 11:21.890
is a popular product
and it's a demographic

11:21.890 --> 11:23.058
we're trying to reach.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.018
Babies? We want babies
to watch the show?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.853
Not babies, their mothers.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.814
I've used Diddy Doo,
for what it's worth.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.607
I mean, not on me

11:30.607 --> 11:33.402
personally, but...
Am I the only one?

11:34.986 --> 11:37.656
Well, cute jar, smells good,
but, weirdly, it gave me a rash.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.034
I can't help but harken
back to our radio days, Georgie,

11:41.034 --> 11:42.411
when you got us sponsored
by that weed killer

11:42.411 --> 11:43.703
- Not the weed killer.
- that wound up killing

11:43.703 --> 11:45.372
not weeds
but a dozen senior citizens.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.040
Fourteen. I read about it.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.167
- Beats Ed Gein.
- Maybe they were
using it wrong.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.794
A lot of empty houses
at bingo that week.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.838
Should we get back
to the monologue?

11:52.838 --> 11:54.089
Just meet the reps.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.382
They're coming to the show
tomorrow night.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.633
They're very excited.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.343
Plus, they're throwing
a little soiree after,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.720
a cruise on the Hudson,
all in your honor.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.721
Yeah, I'm not going to that.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.640
It will be very noticeable

12:03.640 --> 12:04.975
if you don't come.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.893
You didn't think it would be
a good idea to check

12:06.893 --> 12:08.103
with your star
before committing him

12:08.103 --> 12:09.479
to a boat ride
with the diaper rash gang?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.730
I'm sorry, Gordon, I...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.899
You didn't think to call?
We share a wall, George.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.276
You didn't want to do
your special knock?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.486
I should've checked with you.
I realize that now.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.030
- So, this is on you.
- I just didn't think
you'd respond this way.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.574
You didn't think I'd maybe
not want to humiliate myself

12:20.574 --> 12:21.992
on national television?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.994
- You used to trust me.
- You used to listen to me.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.996
- Because the network said...
- Fuck the network!

12:28.457 --> 12:31.668
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get back

12:31.668 --> 12:33.879
to things that we are actually
gonna do on the show.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.089
I'm sorry, Gordon.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.425
- My apologies.
- Thank you.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.719
Now, seriously, how are we gonna
kick things off tonight?

12:40.719 --> 12:43.096
Well, clearly,
you're coming out in a diaper.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.020
I say
let's get political again.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
I'm busy.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.609
Listen, George,
I-I just wanted to say...

12:55.609 --> 12:57.694
I'm sorry, is this you
and David Ben-Gurion?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.029
Yes.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.322
But he's smiling.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.491
He's actually
deeply funny.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.867
There something
I can help you with?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.244
Yes.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.205
I shouldn't have opened
my big fat mouth in there.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.206
It didn't help.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.207
I'll say.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.541
I'm sorry.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.419
Well, I appreciate
you saying that.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.546
And if there's anything
I can do to make it up to you,

13:16.546 --> 13:17.839
I am at your disposal.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.050
How on earth could you help me?

13:20.050 --> 13:23.011
Well, that party tomorrow,
on the boat--

13:23.011 --> 13:25.430
- I could be your pinch hitter.
- A pinch hitter for whom?

13:25.430 --> 13:28.099
For Gordon. Sounds like
you need a little entertainment,

13:28.099 --> 13:30.268
and I'm a comic. I'm also a mom,

13:30.268 --> 13:31.853
and I've got
a million diaper jokes.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.231
I'm good with diapers, ergo
I'm good with diaper people.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.358
That's not a bad idea.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.276
Show them we got a girl writer
who likes the product.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.528
What time do we set sail?

13:39.528 --> 13:42.030
7:30. Don't mention your rash.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.615
My lips are sealed.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.326
- It is gone, isn't it?
- The rash?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.869
Yes, all clear.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.329
- Good.
- Want to check?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.873
No, thank you. Now get out.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.083
What are you gonna wear?

13:53.083 --> 13:54.376
- Out.
- Okay.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.377
Almost done.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.670
Don't fidget.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.088
You don't have to do this,
Mrs. Weissman.

13:58.088 --> 14:01.216
Of course I do. Your earlobes
look positively naked.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.801
- It's obscene.
- But you've already...

14:02.801 --> 14:04.719
- Hey, I'm sewing here.
- Sorry.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.721
I think these will do
quite nicely.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.390
They were my
Grandmother Lehman's.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
An awful woman
with exquisite taste.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.062
- Oh, Mrs. Weissman...
- Oh, there goes
the seam, Zelda.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.815
Sorry. You've already
done so much.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.359
You let me have my special day
here, in this house,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.194
with all my memories
and cleaning products.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.363
Well, I certainly was not
gonna let you get married

14:23.363 --> 14:26.074
at city hall. That's a place
for third weddings,

14:26.074 --> 14:27.367
when everyone's given up on you.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.994
There.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.620
It wouldn't make it
through the hora,

14:30.620 --> 14:33.039
but coming down the hallway
should be fine.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.958
I found it.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.335
Oh, Miriam, put that away.
Shirley, look.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.254
Oh.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.548
There she is,
on her wedding day.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.842
Not a white rose left
on the Eastern Seaboard.

14:43.842 --> 14:47.262
My God, Rose. Were you
even thinner than you are now?

14:47.262 --> 14:49.222
I was, yes.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.016
And that dress, those shoes.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.726
Oh, they were beautiful shoes.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.853
Your mother has perfect feet
for shoes.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.313
Oops.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.148
- Zelda.
- I had to move
to see the picture.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.609
Help me help you. If you want
to wear an heirloom

15:00.609 --> 15:03.028
made of cotton candy, fine,
but do as I tell you,

15:03.028 --> 15:05.363
or you'll be taking your vows
in your underwear.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.283
I used to stare at this album
all the time growing up.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.118
Mama, you look so pretty.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.578
I do, don't I?

15:11.578 --> 15:14.122
And Papa looks so scared.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.624
He does, doesn't he?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.250
That's because he knew
what was coming.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.627
What? Mortgages?

15:18.627 --> 15:19.753
No, the wedding night.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.837
Oh, Shirley, please.

15:20.837 --> 15:21.880
No, everyone thinks

15:21.880 --> 15:23.757
it's the ladies who are scared,

15:23.757 --> 15:25.800
but we have mothers,
best friends,

15:25.800 --> 15:27.844
rabbis, school nurses,

15:27.844 --> 15:30.722
magazines scaring
the shit out of us

15:30.722 --> 15:32.682
the minute we get
our first period.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.976
We're ready. The men, however...

15:34.976 --> 15:36.311
I really don't want
to talk about this.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.481
- Joel was ready.
- Am I invisible? Silent?

15:39.481 --> 15:41.733
Do words come out of my mouth
and disappear into the ether?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.902
I'm just saying,
that boat landed at Normandy,

15:43.902 --> 15:45.153
and he stormed the beach.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.279
That's my Joely.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.031
Miriam, this is nightclub talk.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.616
I am not listening to this.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.368
- Twice.
- Oh, my God.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.911
Plus, you two had been
doing it in your bedroom

15:52.911 --> 15:54.412
for two years prior.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.166
Mama, you look so pretty.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.584
<i>Here comes</i>

15:59.584 --> 16:02.003
the bride.
Get up, get up, get up.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.477
If I could've had
ten minutes with his pants,

16:17.477 --> 16:18.895
he'd look so much better.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.814
I should've given him a suit.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.565
We did all we could do.
We have to let it go.
Be seated.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.741
- How much longer
is he gonna play?
- Hard to say.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.910
Is this a wedding or a recital?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.328
This is Chopin, people.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.664
It's one of his most famous
works. It tells a story.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.791
You don't just stop.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.584
Chopin will forgive you, Papa.
Wrap it up.

16:44.546 --> 16:45.922
Happy?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.258
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

16:48.258 --> 16:51.386
to join together
this man and this woman

16:51.386 --> 16:52.971
in holy matrimony...

16:52.971 --> 16:54.681
Do you remember the day
Zelda arrived at our door?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.975
No.
...signifying
unto us the mystical

16:56.975 --> 16:59.310
union that betwixt Christ
and his Church...

16:59.310 --> 17:01.980
Well, we know what side he's on.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.732
Therefore, if any man present

17:03.732 --> 17:05.358
can show just cause

17:05.358 --> 17:07.485
why they may not be
lawfully joined together,

17:07.485 --> 17:09.779
let him now speak, or else,

17:09.779 --> 17:11.906
- hereafter, hold his peace.
- Mm.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.159
And now, Zelda

17:14.159 --> 17:17.287
and Janusz have each written
their own vows.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.288
Zelda?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.206
Slowly, Zelda, slowly.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.421
Janusz,

17:26.421 --> 17:29.382
I love you.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.676
I love everything about you.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.845
I love that you are on time.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.680
I love that you
hang pictures straight

17:35.680 --> 17:38.933
and always without measuring,
perfectly centered.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.478
I love that you
don't lose money.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.522
I love that you never stain
a wooden spoon.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.232
I love that you lift
with your legs.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.403
And I love...

17:50.403 --> 17:52.155
that I am your wife.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.866
Now, Janusz.

17:54.866 --> 17:58.119
Mine has been
a life of hardship.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.038
Cold winters.
Many nights, no sleep.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.957
My family lived day to day,

18:02.957 --> 18:05.210
but I was good with tools.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.086
I could fix what was broken,

18:07.086 --> 18:10.256
and that was to be my life,
I thought.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.802
And then I meet you, Zelda.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.845
I did not know I was broken

18:15.845 --> 18:17.889
until you were the one
to have fixed me.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.099
Oh, Jesus.
- Moishe.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.143
He's killing me, Shirl.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.854
I will be providing
for you. You will be

18:24.854 --> 18:26.648
wanting for nothing.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.149
Now, you will finally

18:28.149 --> 18:29.692
get to enjoy life,

18:29.692 --> 18:33.238
without burden, never having
to work another single day

18:33.238 --> 18:34.572
for as long as you live.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.449
What did he say?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.993
I'm not quite sure.
His accent is so thick.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.079
Did he say she would
never work again?

18:41.079 --> 18:43.498
- I don't know.
- Miriam,

18:43.498 --> 18:45.166
what did he say?

18:45.166 --> 18:48.086
What? Papa, stop. I'm
trying to listen to the vows.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.088
Rose, is she quitting?

18:50.088 --> 18:51.506
What is wrong with you people?

18:51.506 --> 18:53.383
And I am your Janusz
until we die,

18:53.383 --> 18:54.843
together,

18:54.843 --> 18:57.887
peacefully, let's hope.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.390
Abe, are we losing Zelda?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.016
"Never having to work
another day"

19:02.016 --> 19:04.310
is pretty cut-and-dry.
We're work.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.188
- Shh.
- We're not just work,
we're family.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.940
This is how she tells us?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.859
Hey! There's a man
speaking Polish up here.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.111
And what did he mean,
"without burden"?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.612
Have we been a burden
to Zelda all these years?

19:14.612 --> 19:16.614
Mama, Papa, knock it off.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.117
I don't know why you're being
so calm right now.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.952
Because our Zelda's
getting married.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.912
Apparently our Zelda
thinks we're a burden,

19:22.912 --> 19:23.913
that includes you.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.373
What? No, it doesn't.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.001
Most of her day is spent
taking care of your children.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.128
Yes, she loves them.
They're like family.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.421
Are you sure about that?

19:31.421 --> 19:32.755
My children are not the burden.

19:32.755 --> 19:33.965
He was talking about you guys.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.217
Either way, you're losing

19:36.217 --> 19:38.344
your childcare.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.221
Oh.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.640
Did that sound like
Zelda was quitting to you?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.267
I couldn't tell you
what's what anymore,

19:44.267 --> 19:46.477
- everything's in Polish.
- If she quits, we're screwed.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.605
- Who's gonna watch the kids?
- Oh, God.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.148
Zelda brings them
by the club after school

19:50.148 --> 19:52.191
when I can't pick them up.
This is not good.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.277
Excuse me, guys, Father Piotr,

19:54.277 --> 19:56.446
but is it too late
to make an objection?

19:56.446 --> 19:57.822
- I'm sorry?
- Oy gevalt.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.741
Well, not an objection, per se.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.869
A r-request for
clarification, really.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.495
I'm just wondering,

20:04.495 --> 20:08.541
when you say the bride
will "finally enjoy" her life,

20:08.541 --> 20:12.170
uh, when exactly
will she start enjoying it?

20:12.170 --> 20:15.757
Are we thinking end of the year?

20:15.757 --> 20:17.508
Through the summer?

20:17.508 --> 20:20.261
We have that cocktail party
in May for my clients.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.972
Uh, could the bride
start to enjoy her life

20:22.972 --> 20:24.474
after the cocktail party?

20:24.474 --> 20:26.684
Oh, a-and would the bride
still be able to pick Ethan up

20:26.684 --> 20:28.478
from school Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays,

20:28.478 --> 20:29.771
or was that part
of the burden, too?

20:29.771 --> 20:31.606
Pipe down, all of you.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.359
You're making Jews
look loud and obnoxious!

20:36.152 --> 20:37.570
Damn it!

20:38.988 --> 20:41.449
As Janusz and Zelda
have consented

20:41.449 --> 20:44.744
to holy wedlock before God,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.038
I pronounce that they be

20:47.038 --> 20:49.290
man and wife together.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.210
In the name of the Father,
of the Son,

20:52.210 --> 20:54.170
and of the Holy Ghost.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.588
Amen.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.220
This reminds me of our wedding.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.472
Your mother had her head
up my skirt

21:04.472 --> 21:06.182
the entire night.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.938
Just called down to see
if little Katrina in 3B

21:11.938 --> 21:14.023
- is still looking to babysit.
- And?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.776
Turns out she now has two
littler Katrinas of her own

21:16.776 --> 21:18.069
and needs a babysitter.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.029
Wasn't she 12, like, a year ago?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.698
Hope not.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.033
Vodka? It's ceremonial.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.077
Sure.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.955
To our kids figuring out
how to raise themselves.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.832
To Zelda finding love.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.750
Ooh, much better.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.047
That's good.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.716
Hey, want to add a day care
to the Button Club?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.300
- Maybe at the new club.
- Oh, yeah.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.594
How was Our Mother of Holy Hell?

21:43.594 --> 21:45.221
We're gonna buy it.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.057
That's great.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.434
I'm really happy for you.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.727
You just find
the dirty spot

21:50.727 --> 21:52.186
on the carpet,
and you push forward,

21:52.186 --> 21:53.396
then you pull back.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.440
You push forward,
then pull back.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.817
- For how long?
- Till the dirt is gone.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.570
- How will I know?
- Rose, stop monopolizing her.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.031
Now, Zelda,
can you please explain

22:03.031 --> 22:06.200
- the exact mechanicals
of the suction function?
- No!

22:06.200 --> 22:09.120
And what do we do
when it's full--
- Midge...

22:09.120 --> 22:10.663
- buy a new one?
- You empty it, Mr. Weissman.
- Joel.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.750
When you did that trade show
a couple months ago,

22:13.750 --> 22:16.002
there were two guys.
They were talking to Susie.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.838
- Frank and Nicky?
- Sure. They're friends
of Susie's?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.256
Friends? Well...

22:20.256 --> 22:21.466
'Cause they seem like thugs.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.342
No. Well, yes.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.510
They're friendly thugs.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.720
What the hell
are friendly thugs?

22:25.720 --> 22:27.930
I don't know.
Thugs who say hi to the mailman.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.391
You don't need to worry
about Frank and Nicky.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.392
I think I do.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.935
No, look, yes,

22:32.935 --> 22:34.687
they are not men
who punch a clock for a living.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.105
They punch the guy
who punches the clock.

22:36.105 --> 22:39.108
But they are friends
of Susie's. Yes.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.818
- Sort of.
- Friends?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.361
Well, they weren't
always friends.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.488
They actually
kidnapped her once.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.406
- Uh-huh.
- Mm. They were supposed to

22:45.406 --> 22:46.824
rough her up or kill her

22:46.824 --> 22:48.993
or dump her body in the
East River, but they didn't.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.246
Wow, a happy ending.
Guess I was worried for nothing.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.873
You do not need
to worry about it.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.833
I'm in the club business.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.460
My father's
in the garment industry.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.669
I know these kind of guys.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.713
I'm in the club business,
too, Joel.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.799
Well, if you think this isn't
gonna bite you in the ass...

23:02.799 --> 23:06.052
I'm a big girl, with a big a...
You know what I mean.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.470
I don't want you
mixed up with them.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.430
- I'm not.
- But Susie is.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.349
Midge, I know
she's your manager

23:11.349 --> 23:12.975
and she's helped you
with your career, but

23:12.975 --> 23:14.811
I don't know if you've noticed,
she's kind of fucked up.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.187
Everyone's fucked up in comedy.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.396
And if she's in bed
with these guys,

23:17.396 --> 23:18.523
then you're in bed
with these guys.

23:18.523 --> 23:19.857
I'm not in bed with anyone.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.192
I'm sleeping on the floor, pal.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.069
She had you dancing
on a garbage truck for them.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.279
- I didn't dance. I can't dance.
- Midge, come on.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.531
Joel, you're pissing me off.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.907
Sorry. I don't think you know

23:27.907 --> 23:28.991
what you're getting into here.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.326
I know exactly
what I'm getting into.

23:30.326 --> 23:31.828
It was a one-time thing.
After that,

23:31.828 --> 23:33.621
everything's squared away.
Nothing owed.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.164
So, you can just relax
and go back to your

23:35.164 --> 23:36.916
"club manager
person being thing."

23:36.916 --> 23:38.918
- That was terrible.
- Fuck you. How was that?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.087
I don't want anything to happen
to you. Can't you get that

23:41.087 --> 23:42.964
through your thick head
with the 30 layers

23:42.964 --> 23:44.048
of fucking hair spray?

23:44.048 --> 23:45.591
You never used to mind
my hair spray.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.301
Oh, bullshit.
It's like crop-dusting

23:47.301 --> 23:48.511
in the bathroom
when you're done.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.638
Back off, Joel.
I can take care of myself.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.515
Oh, so, what,
I shouldn't give a shit?

23:52.515 --> 23:54.142
- I never said that.
- I shouldn't care about you?

23:54.142 --> 23:56.060
- Of course you should.
- 'Cause too bad, I'm gonna.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.645
I don't care how mad
you get at me,

23:57.645 --> 23:59.105
- I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.
- Fine.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.065
If anyone so much as touches
a hair on your head--

24:01.065 --> 24:03.276
not that they could with
all that goddamn hair spray--

24:03.276 --> 24:04.735
they would not be dead enough.
Do you understand?

24:04.735 --> 24:07.071
I don't. Can you explain it
again, caveman-style?

24:07.071 --> 24:08.281
A lot of men wash their
hands of their ex-wives,

24:08.281 --> 24:09.949
- you know that?
- I know.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.367
They'd just be like,
"Oh, you're owned

24:11.367 --> 24:12.493
by the mob? Too bad."

24:12.493 --> 24:13.911
Well, they're assholes.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.288
- I'm not washing my hands.
- I know,

24:15.288 --> 24:17.123
'cause you're not an asshole.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.670
Abe?
Zelda.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.214
Mr. Weissman, I told you
not to run the toaster

24:25.214 --> 24:26.674
and vacuum at the same time.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.177
So, my whole life
has to change?

24:32.013 --> 24:33.806
So...

24:33.806 --> 24:35.266
Yeah.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.856
I have to go tell jokes
about diapers on a boat.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.733
That sounds made up.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.401
To be continued?

24:45.401 --> 24:47.111
Apparently so.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.960
- Okay, just let him know
that Dinah
- Okay, just tell him that

25:02.960 --> 25:04.921
- from Susie Myerson
and Associates called again.
- Susie Myerson called again,

25:04.921 --> 25:06.422
- and she expects
a call back soon.
- Thank you so much.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.759
Any luck?

25:09.759 --> 25:13.429
None. I went to Sardi's,
where he'd just had lunch.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.015
He'd eaten everything
but the bacon, egg and avocado

25:16.015 --> 25:17.683
from his Cobb salad
and, honestly,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.060
why get a Cobb salad then?

25:19.060 --> 25:21.229
But the waiter
told me he mentioned

25:21.229 --> 25:22.772
he was heading to his barber,

25:22.772 --> 25:25.024
so I go down to Astor Place.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.484
You know how many guys
named David

25:26.484 --> 25:27.818
were having
their hair cut in there?

25:27.818 --> 25:29.153
They all looked alike, too.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.364
I had to get a straight razor
shave to fit in.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.200
Felt really fucking good.
I recommend it.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.618
That's how I did. How about you?

25:35.618 --> 25:37.286
- I've left 52 messages.
- Did you pretend

25:37.286 --> 25:39.163
to be Eartha Kitt?
You do a great Eartha Kitt.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.873
Three hours ago, yes.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.083
Mm. What about your IRS lady?

25:42.083 --> 25:43.334
I did her, too,
and now

25:43.334 --> 25:45.336
I have to have lunch
with his accountant.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.296
Dinah, I just heard.
He left for the day.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.423
Motherfucker!

25:51.509 --> 25:53.719
That's it.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.763
- Where are you going?
- Back out.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.391
Gonna show off my shave.

25:58.391 --> 26:01.477
Hello?

26:01.477 --> 26:03.479
Yes, this is the
Internal Revenue Service.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.730

26:27.295 --> 26:30.298
Oh, yes, yes, Nanette.
Thank you.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.757
I made it myself in the back.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.426
They only put out bourbon
at these things

26:33.426 --> 26:35.636
'cause it's all these guys
drink. It's so boring.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.179

26:37.179 --> 26:39.432

26:46.689 --> 26:49.150
Well, don't you look
pretty as a picture.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.110
You clean up nice
yourself, George.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.029
They're all in very good moods.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.531
And they all have
very young wives.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.034
Those aren't their wives.
You ready to knock 'em dead?

26:58.034 --> 27:00.661
It's that or jump overboard
and swim back to shore.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.080
Yes. I'm ready. Let's go.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.790
You have better jokes
than that, right?

27:04.790 --> 27:07.126
- I do.
- All right.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.257

How are we all doing tonight?

27:18.429 --> 27:20.306
What a great event, right?

27:20.306 --> 27:23.267
Sailing around the isle
of Manhattan.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.644
The combination
of a swaying boat

27:25.644 --> 27:28.564
and double bourbons.
What could go wrong?

27:28.564 --> 27:31.359
I am Mrs. Maisel, one of

27:31.359 --> 27:32.485
<i>The Gordon Ford Show</i> writers,

27:32.485 --> 27:34.737
and I want to thank you
for your interest in our

27:34.737 --> 27:38.324
humble, little,
"number one in the ratings

27:38.324 --> 27:41.077

and smoke it, Jack Paar" show.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.663
Wow.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.250
Here I am talking to a boat
full of men about diaper cream.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.504
I wonder if somewhere
on the East River

27:51.504 --> 27:53.089
there's a male comic
talking to a boat

27:53.089 --> 27:55.549
full of women about power tools.

27:55.549 --> 27:58.427
Ironic that
Diddy Doo Diaper Cream

27:58.427 --> 28:01.347
was invented by men.
I mean, men are masters

28:01.347 --> 28:04.433
of the universe--
wheel, fire, war, et cetera--

28:04.433 --> 28:05.976
but babies?

28:05.976 --> 28:08.354
Not really their domain, is it?

28:08.354 --> 28:11.399
Every time a man holds a baby
it ends in screaming tears.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.734
And then the baby
gets upset, too.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.406
I appreciate you guys, really.

28:18.406 --> 28:21.367
Th-This boat is full
of the only men in America

28:21.367 --> 28:23.702
who actually care this much
about baby ointment.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.038
But let's be honest,

28:26.038 --> 28:27.957
the biggest reason you care

28:27.957 --> 28:31.127
is that it makes you
a ton of money.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.258
But the second-biggest reason
is your future third wives

28:37.258 --> 28:38.759
are currently in diapers,

28:38.759 --> 28:40.511
and you don't want them
to be uncomfortable.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.889
And I think
that's very kind of you.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.891
Yes.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.854
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.

28:49.854 --> 28:51.147
A question. Yes.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.189
- A question.
- Yes.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.524
It's something
I can't figure out.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.359
- I hope you won't say no.
- No.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.361
- It's all about my sister.
- What?

28:57.361 --> 28:58.362
- My sister.
- Who?

28:58.362 --> 28:59.363
- My sister.
- Oh.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.990
She's joined a nudist colony.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.202
- So, what I want to know...
- Yes?

- Susie Myerson.

29:21.177 --> 29:24.263
I represent James Howard.
You know, that terrific comic

29:24.263 --> 29:26.307
with the startling dramatic
ability you've had audition

29:26.307 --> 29:28.434
for your war picture,
what is it, four times now?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.727
You can't be serious.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.646
Why order a Cobb salad
if you don't like bacon or eggs?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.023
How do you know
I like Cobb salad?

29:34.023 --> 29:35.733
You don't like Cobb salad
is my point.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.359
I-I think you should leave.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.153
This is not the place
for this conversation.

29:39.153 --> 29:42.072
I agree. It's 180
fucking degrees in here,

29:42.072 --> 29:43.908
and the acoustics are terrible.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.701
You can call my office during
business hours and make...

29:45.701 --> 29:49.288
I have been calling your office
during business hours, David,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.373
nonstop for two days straight.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.709
You don't take my calls,
you won't call me back.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.212
What are we, married?
All I need is an answer,

29:56.212 --> 29:57.630
so I can get this kid
off my back.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.215
He's driving me
up a goddamn wall.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.217
I will pay you five bucks
for that water.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.468
It's free over there.
There's a jug.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.887
I will die if I move.
Give me that water.

30:08.599 --> 30:12.311
Ah. Okay. So, what's it
gonna be, yes or no?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.896
- Huh?
- You think I'm giving you

30:13.896 --> 30:15.648
an answer here and now?

30:15.648 --> 30:18.692
- Just pick one.
- He was very good
and I'm still debating.

30:18.692 --> 30:22.321
David, seriously, listen.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.533
I don't give a shit. Actually,
I'd prefer it to be no.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.868
This kid is a great comic,

30:27.868 --> 30:30.037
and, frankly,
I make so much more money

30:30.037 --> 30:31.747
off of him
if he goes out on tour.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.375
I mean, he goes out for a year,
boom, that's my next car,

30:34.375 --> 30:37.127
and he comes back a giant star,

30:37.127 --> 30:38.921
and then I can get him
a world tour.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.215
Oh, I'll have to move to the
country, I'll have so many cars.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.633
I'll park 'em
all over the place,

30:42.633 --> 30:44.134
and then I'll just
drive one car to another

30:44.134 --> 30:45.427
all day long.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.721
If he were
to come work for you,

30:47.721 --> 30:50.474
you'd pay him nothing,
and I would have to take that

30:50.474 --> 30:53.811
'cause he wants to do this
ridiculous movie so badly.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.396
He's never wanted
anything more in his life.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.814
He won't shut up about it.

30:56.814 --> 30:59.316
Frankly, I don't know why.
I read the script.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.277
It's terrible. It's a terrible,
terrible script.

31:01.277 --> 31:02.278
Now, hold on a second.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.779
It's a brilliant script.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.365
The man who wrote it
was nominated for an Oscar.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.492
Did he win? Didn't think so.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.828
I'm just telling you,
it's got act three problems,

31:10.828 --> 31:12.037
but, you know, you go ahead

31:12.037 --> 31:13.414
and do what you're gonna do.
I don't care.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.125
"I don't care"?
That's what you told him?

31:16.125 --> 31:18.043
Yep.
- And that it was
a terrible script?

31:18.043 --> 31:20.713
- That's right.
- After you cornered him
at a gay bathhouse?

31:20.713 --> 31:22.590
Look, I had a hunch
where he hung out,

31:22.590 --> 31:24.842
but I didn't want to go there.
He forced my hand.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.052
What was it like? The bathhouse?

31:27.052 --> 31:28.804
So many dicks.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.889
Just as I pictured.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.142
Stop looking at me that way.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.977
You begged him
not to hire your client.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.854
That's the opposite of what
you're supposed to do.

31:36.854 --> 31:39.607
Look, it was my last play.
He said he liked James

31:39.607 --> 31:41.150
but he's also looking
at Dick Gregory,

31:41.150 --> 31:42.443
James Earl Jones.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.903
That's stiff competition,
so I had to do something.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.405
Stiff.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.865
Go home, Maggie.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.867
All right.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.786
I had to force my way
out of the place, too.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.164
Of all the times to form
a nude conga line.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.373
So, what now?

31:56.373 --> 31:58.709
Mm. We wait.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.253
Then we throw up.
And then we wait.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.507
I signed a really good
cabaret singer, though.

32:05.507 --> 32:06.675
That's something.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.261
Mm. James will be thrilled
to hear that.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.472
So, boys,

32:11.472 --> 32:13.140
how about our
secret weapon here?

32:13.140 --> 32:15.184
- Can I spot talent or what?
- Hysterical.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.144
Who knew our diaper cream
was so funny?

32:17.144 --> 32:19.855
Well, anything involving a tush
is generally comedy gold.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.649
Do you perform
like this often?

32:21.649 --> 32:23.192
Every night,
as a matter of fact.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.318
You know, George,
she should be on the show.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.362
I've never thought of that.

32:26.362 --> 32:27.655
- She could be our spokesperson.
- Intriguing.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.490
Uh, fellas.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.367
She could be our funny
Diddy Doo Doll.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.993
- Changing a baby.
- In a bikini.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.454
Yes, because motherhood
can be sexy.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.665
Okay. Well, it's been
lovely speaking

32:37.665 --> 32:38.874
with you, gentlemen. George,

32:38.874 --> 32:40.376
- I'll see you at the office.
- All right.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.585
I love this idea.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.504
This is the best idea
I've ever heard.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.839
Come on.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.049
I got to
get back to work.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.801
Five minutes.
One dance.

32:48.801 --> 32:52.012
- There's no music.
- I'll hum a little something.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.847
Please, let me go.
But you're too cute.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.475
- Oy, buddy!
- Yeah?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.519
Why don't you let the nice lady
finish her shift?

32:58.519 --> 32:59.770
We're just having a chat.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.021
Well, I don't know
what your mama taught you,

33:01.021 --> 33:02.439
but you don't need to use
your hands to chat.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.733
Oh, it was nothing.

33:04.733 --> 33:08.696
It's not nice to touch things
that aren't yours, right?

33:08.696 --> 33:11.031
Ooh. Italian?

33:11.031 --> 33:12.825
Very funny. Give me my coat.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.910
Oh, am I touching something
that you don't want touched?

33:14.910 --> 33:16.286
- That's enough.
- Do you not like that?

33:16.286 --> 33:17.663
You've made your point,
now give it back.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.790
Is it expensive?
Looks expensive.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.834
- Give it back.
- Does it look good on me?

33:21.834 --> 33:23.502
I just want to see. Oh.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.754
Oh.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.840
Huh.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.925
You didn't have your keys
in there, did you?

33:29.925 --> 33:33.220
Well, that took a turn.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.138
How embarrassing.

33:37.683 --> 33:41.270
Well, she's
not laughing now.

33:51.447 --> 33:55.325
Hello there. Susie Myerson,
of Susie Myerson and Associates.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.661
I represent... this woman.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.122
Susie, this is Alan Young
from NBC Legal,

34:00.122 --> 34:02.207
Barbara Stern,
head of Public Relations

34:02.207 --> 34:04.293
and George Toledano,
our executive producer.

34:04.293 --> 34:05.878
Susie is Midge's manager.

34:05.878 --> 34:08.505
- You didn't call a lawyer?
- I don't have a lawyer.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.132
I, have, uh, my card here.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.050
Jesus, mildew grows fast.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.678
Might want to let these dry out
before you put 'em away.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.181
This isn't a friendly
"get to know you," miss.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.640
Gordon will be here momentarily.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.933
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.813
What happened? Why are you wet?
What's with the coat?

34:24.813 --> 34:27.274
Long story.
I may have fucked up.

34:27.274 --> 34:30.527
Well, well, well.
Emergency meetings, my favorite.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.904
Normally, I'd be furious about

34:31.904 --> 34:33.197
being called in
from a night out,

34:33.197 --> 34:34.740
but tonight's thing
was for an animal rescue

34:34.740 --> 34:36.575
that Hedy loves that I do not,

34:36.575 --> 34:37.910
so you're actually rescuing me.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.788
Wow. This ought to be good.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.873
It's not. There was
an incident on the boat.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.500
- What boat?
- The boat.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.084
The function with the company.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.544
I'm sorry, the boat thing
still happened?

34:47.544 --> 34:48.670
It was already paid for.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.339
- And you were on the boat?
- She was.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.758
Why were you
on the boat?
- I wanted to help.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.177
- Have maritime skills, do you?
- I was the entertainment.

34:55.177 --> 34:58.055
- You entertained sponsors?
- Yes, to help out George.

34:58.055 --> 35:01.058
So, not only did the boat party
that I said no to still happen,

35:01.058 --> 35:03.143
but this is who you sent up
in lieu of me?

35:03.143 --> 35:05.479
A staff writer that gets
one joke in every four weeks?

35:05.479 --> 35:06.688
What, was Trudy busy?

35:06.688 --> 35:08.524
Hey, the gig was good.
The reps loved it.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.108
And her joke average is way up.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.653
Yeah, all good gigs end with
emergency meetings right after.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.530
The gig's not
what's in question.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.948
Why don't you stop being coy,

35:15.948 --> 35:18.575
young lady, and tell Gordon
exactly why we're here?

35:18.575 --> 35:20.953
Well...

35:20.953 --> 35:22.496
I was arrested
by the coast guard.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.789
They can arrest people?

35:23.789 --> 35:26.124
Are we free anywhere
in this country?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.251
You really should have
gone with Trudy.

35:27.251 --> 35:28.794
It wasn't my fault.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.629
There was a guy getting way
too friendly with a waitress

35:30.629 --> 35:32.923
who wasn't appreciating it,
so I cut in to save her

35:32.923 --> 35:35.300
and things just got
a little out of hand.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.302
That's not what I heard.
He said nothing happened.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.137
He was merely talking to the
girl when this one came over,

35:39.137 --> 35:40.347
assaulted him,

35:40.347 --> 35:42.432
and threw his jacket
in the goddamn river.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.434
It's a jacket. He's probably got
a closet full of 'em.

35:44.434 --> 35:45.811
Who was this asshole?

35:45.811 --> 35:47.563
He was one of the reps
from Diddy Doo.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.815
Diddy Doo? The diaper cream?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.191
They're gonna sponsor the show?

35:51.191 --> 35:53.277
That, George. That's why.

35:53.277 --> 35:56.113
Look, people, this
isn't that big a problem.

35:56.113 --> 35:57.364
I mean, what are we
looking at here,

35:57.364 --> 35:59.074
a slap on the wrist,
a dry cleaning bill?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.076
The charges include
aggravated assault

36:01.076 --> 36:02.077
and disorderly conduct.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.161
Wait, they're charging her

36:03.161 --> 36:04.121
for assaulting a guy who was

36:04.121 --> 36:05.414
assaulting somebody else first?

36:05.414 --> 36:07.291
- There's more.
- More?

36:08.959 --> 36:11.211
The boat was far enough out
from Manhattan that,

36:11.211 --> 36:13.130
technically, we were on
a stretch of water

36:13.130 --> 36:15.841
that's considered international.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.342
What?

36:17.342 --> 36:18.927
So, France may have to weigh in.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.762
France? Like France-France?

36:20.762 --> 36:22.639
- That's idiotic.
- There's more.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.474
The "more" guy.
Continue.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.268
Since the guy's wallet
was in his jacket

36:26.268 --> 36:27.978
and there was money
in his wallet and on a boat,

36:27.978 --> 36:30.063
money is considered treasure...

36:30.063 --> 36:32.399
I technically committed
an act of piracy.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.859
Fuck me. You're a pirate?

36:36.528 --> 36:38.113
Oh, my God.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.616
This is so much funnier
than saving otters.

36:40.616 --> 36:43.243
Don't you laugh.
And why are you here?

36:43.243 --> 36:44.995
Just really fucking lucky,
I guess.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.497
The press was in attendance,
photographs taken

36:47.497 --> 36:49.625
and Barbara's already received
several calls for comment.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.335
- And whose fault
is that, George?
- Hers!

36:51.335 --> 36:53.629
- No, it's yours.
- Mine?

36:53.629 --> 36:55.839
You went through with this thing
after I said no.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.175
Barbara, you're PR. You
should've thought this through.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.676
I was following George's orders.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.595
Really? Do we use
that excuse anymore?

37:01.595 --> 37:04.014
- Gordon, we're not...
- No, I've been here
long enough.

37:04.014 --> 37:05.265
My car is waiting.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.893
George? Not a good week
for us, old friend.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.227
You'll fix all this
with legal and PR?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.729
Isn't she fired?

37:10.729 --> 37:13.899
No. But I'd hide my wenches
and booty from her.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.276
- Alan?
- We'll get the charges
dropped, Gordon.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.903
Good. And, Barbara,

37:17.903 --> 37:19.863
let the press run whatever
they're gonna run tomorrow.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.616
Let the world know that I've got
a pirate on my staff.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.411
This isn't over.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.663
It is.

37:30.374 --> 37:33.293
Did you see George's face?

37:33.293 --> 37:35.295
I wasn't this happy
when my kids were born.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.505
You're a sick fuck, Mike.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.548
Yeah, okay.

37:38.548 --> 37:41.468
I think I'll go home and have
dinner with my wife for once.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.679
It's 10:30.
- It's New York City, Susie.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.389
Don't be so suburban.

37:47.516 --> 37:50.352
They told me I could keep the
coat. I didn't steal the coat.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.897
So it's a win-win. Come on,
I'll split a cab with you.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.983
Where's your ship docked,
east or west side?

37:55.983 --> 37:58.694
- Don't make me laugh.
- Argh.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.413
Susie Myerson and Associates.
Not him.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.915
- Hang up.
- Tell me what he said
one more time.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.959
He said you were great
and he said that he loved you.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.669
- He said that?
- Yes, he said that.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.629
- So, why hasn't he called?
- He's going to.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.923
Susie Myerson and Associates.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.091
- Not him.
- Hang up.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.760
He's gonna call. Trust me.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.178
I got to go walk around
the block.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.389
No, no, don't go, James.
I got a good feeling about this.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.224
Good feeling? That's enough
to get me on the subway

38:29.224 --> 38:30.976
if I find a dime and a nickel.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.811
Susie Myerson
and Associates.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.354
Is it him?
No.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.898
Hang up.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.400
Do you think we should cancel
the tour

38:38.400 --> 38:39.985
- till we find out?
- No.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.404
- Why not?
- 'Cause there is no tour.
I made that up.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.072
Oh, my God.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.324
"Her name was Diana,
but I knew her as DiDi."

38:46.324 --> 38:47.909
Are you doing the scene
to yourself again?

38:47.909 --> 38:50.078
Stop doing the scene. Stop it.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.330
Susie Myerson and Associates.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.292
Yes, sir. Please hold.
David Weston

38:55.292 --> 38:57.919
- is on line one.
- David Weston is on line one.

38:57.919 --> 39:01.214
David Weston is on line...

39:01.214 --> 39:02.883
Tell him I'll call him back.

39:02.883 --> 39:04.968
What?! Susie...

39:09.222 --> 39:10.474
Do it, Ruttles.

39:10.474 --> 39:13.018
Mr. Weston, she's on
another call right now.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.269
Sounds like
she's gonna be a while,

39:14.269 --> 39:15.896
but she will call you back.

39:15.896 --> 39:17.105
Yes, sir, I promise.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.732
Bye, now.

39:21.777 --> 39:23.737
Susie, can I ask you
one question?

39:23.737 --> 39:25.072
Shoot.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.531
What are you gonna wear

39:26.531 --> 39:27.991
when I take you to the Oscars?

39:27.991 --> 39:30.702
Oh, I'll be ready for you.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.079
Hey, why don't you
do that scene for me?

39:32.079 --> 39:33.371
Really?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.957
Yeah. Let's see what
all the fuss is about.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.752
"Her name was Diana,

39:38.752 --> 39:40.212
but I knew her as DiDi.

39:40.212 --> 39:41.880
She was my babysitter.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.256
I wanted to marry her,

39:43.256 --> 39:44.466
she wanted me to do
my math homework.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.842
The only reason I-I became..."

39:45.842 --> 39:47.135
You hear about
this Susie Myerson?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.512
<i>She got her comic cast
in Weston's new picture.</i>

39:48.512 --> 39:49.846
He never hires unknowns.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.348
I heard she got
a face-to-face with him,

39:51.348 --> 39:52.599
<i>on his turf.</i>

39:52.599 --> 39:53.809
How'd she get
close to him?

39:53.809 --> 39:54.810
She surprised him.

39:54.810 --> 39:55.936
I heard she took anatomy,

39:55.936 --> 39:57.646
then posed as his cardiologist.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.147
I heard she marched right into
his daughter's wedding.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.732
Popped up in the back seat
of his car.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.400
Jumped out of the cake
at his birthday party.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.152
In the confessional booth
at St. Patrick's.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.445
Side by side
at the Four Seasons.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.114
Got to his housekeeper
and told her he was her cousin.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.740
Booked an adjoining room
at the Beverly Hilton,

40:08.740 --> 40:10.075
marched right through
the shared door.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.452
Took LSD with him
and Timothy Leary.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.829
Swam up to him
in Palm Springs.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.041
Holy shit.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.877
And will you be needing
a shirt as well, madame?

40:20.877 --> 40:22.838
Give me the whole
shebang, Jeeves.

40:37.394 --> 40:38.979
Mrs. Maisel. Please.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.438
- Oh, me?
- Mm-hmm.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.941
- You sure?
- You say everything I think.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.235
A terrifying connection.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.736
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.989
Pardon me, miss, but could I
get your autograph as well?

40:48.989 --> 40:51.241
Well, as I live and breathe.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.076
I didn't know you came downtown.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.995
I try not to, but they sell
the best smack

40:54.995 --> 40:56.538
on that corner right over there.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.123
- Ah.
- Great set, by the way.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.624
You saw my set?

40:59.624 --> 41:00.876
I did. Bought a ticket
and everything.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.085
They made you buy a ticket?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.753
Ah, I haven't paid for a
ticket in ten years,

41:03.753 --> 41:05.672
but I would have, which I think
counts for something.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.133
Oh, well, still, thanks.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.260
So, you hungry?
Can I buy you dinner?

41:11.845 --> 41:13.972
Sure. Why not.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.849
There's a great place
just up the block.

41:17.851 --> 41:20.270
I have never seen you
out of a suit.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.689
And I was expecting you
to be in full pirate regalia.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.608
It's my parrot's night off.

41:28.528 --> 41:31.114
This isn't quite where
I imagined taking you.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.866
No? Too snobby?

41:32.866 --> 41:35.327
Too sticky.
Can they at least turn off

41:35.327 --> 41:36.703
a couple
of the fluorescent lights?

41:36.703 --> 41:38.872
Don't worry,
one'll burn out in a second.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.876
Lill, a chocolate donut
and a coffee

41:42.876 --> 41:45.170
- will save my life.
- Coming up.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.505
Hey, Officer Peluso.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.758
Hey, Midge Maisel.
I'll be damned.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.385
Nice to see you.
Gordon, this is Officer Peluso.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.929
He's arrested me a couple times.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.430
- Really?
- Mm.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.933
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Hey, you're the TV guy.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.769
- That's me.
- I almost didn't recognize you
without your suit.

42:00.769 --> 42:03.230
- So, how are you doing?
- I'm a pirate.

42:03.230 --> 42:04.689
Terrific.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.858
Ah, thanks, honey.

42:06.858 --> 42:10.195
Nice meeting you out of uniform.
And you, be good.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.197
You know I won't.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.532
How many times
have you been arrested?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.451
A lady never tells.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.329
So, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.747
- You want?
- Sure.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.708
Our second date should be
someplace nicer than this.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.461
- This is not a date.
- Oh, you're telling me.
There's a guy actively dying

42:26.461 --> 42:28.338
in the corner over there.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.173
Okay then, a better first date.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.591
I'm not going
on a date with you.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.843
Fine. We'll just start
sleeping together. Personally,

42:33.843 --> 42:35.804
I'll miss the romance, but, you
know, I'll take what I can get.

42:35.804 --> 42:37.847
- Gordon. Gordon.
- Just once then.

42:37.847 --> 42:40.433
We'll do it up nice.
Penthouse at the Carlyle,

42:40.433 --> 42:43.395
champagne, robes and slippers
for after, or during,

42:43.395 --> 42:45.188
whatever the lady wishes.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.191
A kiss? One...

42:48.191 --> 42:49.985
really terrific kiss?

42:49.985 --> 42:52.404
Come on, you got to at least let
me redeem myself on that front.

42:52.404 --> 42:53.905
I'm a much better kisser
off the ice.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.283
I'm sure you are, but...

42:56.283 --> 42:58.410
But...

42:58.410 --> 43:00.578
Gordon, if we started a thing...

43:00.578 --> 43:02.622
Whoa. No one mentioned
"a thing."

43:02.622 --> 43:04.165
Let me tell you
what would happen.

43:04.165 --> 43:06.209
- Someone would find out...
- No one would find out.

43:06.209 --> 43:07.627
Someone would find out.

43:07.627 --> 43:09.170
Go on.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.797
Then everyone would find out.

43:10.797 --> 43:12.549
And nothing
would change for you,

43:12.549 --> 43:14.175
but everything
would change for me.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.218
No, it wouldn't.
I wouldn't let it.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.428
There'd be snickers

43:16.428 --> 43:17.971
and sideways glances

43:17.971 --> 43:20.056
and whispers when
I'm in the ladies' room.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.850
You can use my bathroom.
It's a much better bathroom.

43:21.850 --> 43:23.268
I've got hand towels
with my name on them.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.937
And then, suddenly,
I'm just "Gordon's girl."

43:25.937 --> 43:28.565
Not the girl who scored all
those great jokes on your show,

43:28.565 --> 43:31.693
not the only woman writer on the
number-one show in the country,

43:31.693 --> 43:33.778
just "Gordon's girl."

43:34.863 --> 43:37.282
It's got a nice ring to it,
though, the alliteration.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.034
All the work I did
to prove myself,

43:39.034 --> 43:40.577
gone in a single stroke.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.579
Now, I must interject here.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.998
It absolutely will not
be a single stroke.

43:44.998 --> 43:46.499
I go to the gym
for exactly that reason.

43:46.499 --> 43:48.710
But if I'm being honest,
the reason that,

43:48.710 --> 43:50.503
in spite
of your wit and charm...

43:50.503 --> 43:52.213
And face, don't forget the face.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.007
The reason I cannot
sleep with you is

43:54.007 --> 43:56.343
if I'm sleeping with you
and I get on the show...

43:56.343 --> 43:58.511
- You're not getting
on the show.
- Let me finish.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.638
If I'm sleeping with you
and I get on the show...

44:00.638 --> 44:01.723
You're never
getting on the show.

44:01.723 --> 44:03.308
See, you keep harping
on the wrong thing here.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.893
Zip it.

44:05.977 --> 44:09.147
If I'm sleeping with you,
when I get on the show...

44:09.147 --> 44:12.192
I'll never really know if
I got on because I deserved it

44:12.192 --> 44:14.903
or if I got on because
I'm sleeping with you.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.531
I've got a great house
in Nantucket.

44:18.531 --> 44:21.034
I've got bicycles.
One of them has a basket.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.285
You look like
a basket girl to me.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.040
Had to give it one last shot.

44:29.084 --> 44:30.835
