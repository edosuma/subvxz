WEBVTT

00:37.839 --> 00:39.040
You got it.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.409
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.343
Come on!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.814
Where's your pink
pussy hat, princess?

00:46.881 --> 00:49.449
It's at home, covering
up my giant dildos.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.450
Where's yours?

00:57.825 --> 00:58.692
Winner!

01:00.627 --> 01:02.429
Suck my tits!

01:02.495 --> 01:03.097
Suck her tits!

01:03.164 --> 01:04.165
Yeah!

01:04.232 --> 01:06.934
Oh shit, I'm just
getting warmed up!

01:07.001 --> 01:10.805
Now which one of you buttholes
is next?

01:10.872 --> 01:12.874
This butthole!

01:16.010 --> 01:17.744
Fucking Brenda.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.646
Hey, Danny.

01:34.527 --> 01:35.428
Jerry.

01:36.496 --> 01:37.832
Oh shoot,
it's Bonecrusher

01:37.899 --> 01:40.001
versus the Dominator!

01:46.040 --> 01:48.075
Ready, go!

01:52.013 --> 01:53.047
Crush those bones!

01:53.114 --> 01:54.148
Come on, you got 'em.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.517
Come on, you got 'em,
you got 'em.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.994
God, oh fuck!

02:07.061 --> 02:09.196
Jerry, flip this table over!

02:11.698 --> 02:13.100
You dirty cheat.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.536
Oh, looks like you won't
be going to Nationals, Danny.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.083
Oh shit.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.819
Oh shit.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.520
Ice, ice, ice, ice.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.721
Oh god.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.789
I think it's broken.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.258
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.060
There's no fucking way

02:39.126 --> 02:40.294
that she broke my wrist.

02:40.361 --> 02:44.664
I mean hey, if it was
broken, could I do this?

02:44.731 --> 02:45.765
Oh, fuck!

02:45.833 --> 02:47.868
Jerry, crush that can, fuck.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.538
She tore the ligament
in my shoulder.

02:51.604 --> 02:52.772
This is just like
Pittsburgh a month ago.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.177
She's getting rid of
all the competition

02:56.243 --> 02:58.678
so that she can
get the grand slam.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.547
You were the best chance
we had of beating her.

03:00.613 --> 03:01.916
And now your arm is fucked.

03:01.983 --> 03:04.919
Yeah, and there is no way
in hell I'm gonna let her

03:04.986 --> 03:06.821
win this tournament.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.555
We need somebody new.

03:08.621 --> 03:11.025
Somebody she's not expecting.

03:11.092 --> 03:12.625
We need a ringer.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.252
That should do it.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.586
Oh, great.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.188
I don't get these going
in the next 10 minutes,

03:41.255 --> 03:42.056
I'll lose the day.

03:42.123 --> 03:44.191
She's back up and running.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.259
Awesome, thanks, Sue Ellen.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.760
How much do I owe you?

03:50.097 --> 03:53.067
Wow, that's more
than I was expecting.

03:53.134 --> 03:54.869
Sorry, sweety.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.137
It's on its last legs.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.872
I did what I could.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.673
Or I could get you
a new one for 8,000.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.076
Okay.

04:05.346 --> 04:09.984
Okay, so you can run
all three of these.

04:10.051 --> 04:11.751
I only need one.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.687
No, you'll need
to run all three.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.755
Sorry.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.080
Hey, ex-wifey.

04:40.815 --> 04:42.950
Steve, what are you
doing here?

04:43.017 --> 04:46.020
Don't freak out, I
just came by to say hi.

04:46.087 --> 04:47.787
Oh, and these finally came.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.191
I asked you to mail
these to my apartment.

04:50.257 --> 04:50.991
Ugh.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.493
Well, I was in the hood

04:52.560 --> 04:55.229
and I wanted to make sure you
didn't burn the place down.

04:55.296 --> 04:58.399
If you do, we could split the
insurance money.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.234
I'm not gonna burn
the place down.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.402
Ah, you wouldn't do it.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.670
Someone else would do it.

05:03.736 --> 05:04.939
And noone'll be in here,
noone's gonna get hurt.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.073
It was a joke.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.341
Whatever.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.209
Please, don't.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.077
Have you washed your hands?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.912
What, no, why?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.814
You're touching food
that I'm going to serve.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.149
If you're gonna
have a fit, okay?

05:15.216 --> 05:16.350
I'm not having a fit,

05:16.417 --> 05:17.717
I'm just asking you
to have clean hands.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.187
If you're gonna be
hysterical, I'm gonna leave.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.155
Okay, I don't need this anymore.

05:21.222 --> 05:22.423
- Okay.
- All right, fine.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.557
- Okay.
- Jeez.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.358
Thank you for
dropping these off.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.026
Yeah, you're welcome.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.831
Ugh, what?

05:31.298 --> 05:32.133
What is going on here?

05:32.199 --> 05:33.267
That donut sucks.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.734
That's not a donut,
that's bread.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.237
A donut is bread.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.261
Boo!

06:01.195 --> 06:02.062
- Oh, ow!
- Oh, Danny!

06:02.129 --> 06:03.030
- Oh, shit!
- Oh my god.

06:03.097 --> 06:05.065
- I'm so sorry.
- My titty!

06:05.132 --> 06:06.233
I'm so sorry.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.268
Oh my god.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.302
- Hi, Mel!
- Hi!

06:08.369 --> 06:09.103
Hi, Danny.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.205
- Oh, you really scared me.
- Oh, shit.

06:11.272 --> 06:12.306
No, it's fine.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.207
Oh sorry, you spilled
your papers.

06:13.274 --> 06:14.308
- Oh.
- I'll take those.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.376
- Give me the papers.
- What papers?

06:16.443 --> 06:17.144
- I don't have any papers.
- Give it to me.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.212
Please give it to me.

06:18.279 --> 06:19.180
Whoah.

06:20.281 --> 06:23.083
Decree of dissolution
of marriage?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.987
Holy shit, that's awesome, Mel!

06:32.860 --> 06:35.429
And it's fucking shitty.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.498
But in the long run
it's awesome,

06:37.565 --> 06:40.534
but right now
it's gonna be awful.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.136
Sorry, Mel.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.572
It's good to see you.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.705
It's good
to see you too.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.209
Sorry I punched you
in the breast.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.910
No, it felt really cool.

06:49.977 --> 06:50.444
It did?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.711
Yeah.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.481
I'm so glad you threw
the trash out finally.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.450
I've been back there
for like six hours.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.484
I'm sorry I haven't called.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.886
Are you okay?

06:59.954 --> 07:01.788
Oh yeah, this is nothing.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.923
I'm sorry I haven't called.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.558
I've been just as bad.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.093
What have you been up to?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.861
Oh, man, Mel.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.797
I've been doing this
like transatlantic route

07:10.864 --> 07:12.866
and I was able to get
myself my own rig.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.701
That's so cool!

07:13.766 --> 07:16.070
Yeah, right?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.138
Ugh, this lady's the worst.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.842
Who is she?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.314
Hi, how are you?

07:27.381 --> 07:28.482
Hi, super busy.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.850
Oh yeah.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.219
Well I have your small
cappuccino with extra foam.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.988
And where is my scone?

07:34.054 --> 07:34.955
Oh.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.592
Are you sure?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.527
I'd like to have my
scone that comes free

07:40.594 --> 07:41.595
when I order.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.063
Mhmm, okay.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.433
God.

07:47.334 --> 07:51.238
Mhmm.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.206
Okay.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.252
Ugh!

08:05.319 --> 08:06.387
Have a great day.

08:07.388 --> 08:08.989
Have a great day?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.190
What the hell, Mel?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.293
What am I gonna do,
fight her over it?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.862
Yeah, you're gonna go
out there and kick her ass

08:14.928 --> 08:16.130
and then slash her tires.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.533
Danny, you know the
customer is always right.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.001
You know what would determine

08:21.068 --> 08:22.236
who's right and who's wrong?

08:22.303 --> 08:25.272
A good old-fashioned arm
wrestling match, huh?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.308
What, that's the dumbest
thing I ever heard.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.010
Oh, come on, you used
to do it all the time.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.211
Yeah, when I was a kid!

08:31.278 --> 08:33.247
Or as a goof in college,
you know,

08:33.314 --> 08:36.216
when we couldn't decide
what to get for takeout.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.120
- Calzone wins again, yeah!
- Dammit.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.991
Please don't tell my mom
I look like this.

08:44.058 --> 08:46.193
I mean you always won.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.628
Well, arm wrestling
isn't gonna solve

08:47.695 --> 08:48.595
my problems anymore.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.663
I don't know.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.899
I still think you should
arm wrestle her.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.934
I don't know,
it's not worth it.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.502
Oh, what?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.139
Mel, are you okay?

09:00.474 --> 09:01.442
Yeah, I'm great.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.312
You know what?

09:05.379 --> 09:09.016
You need to do like an
eat, pray, love thing.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.651
Come with me on the road.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.286
I got a shipment to Detroit.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.989
Oh, it's been so long since
we've gotten to hang out

09:16.056 --> 09:17.858
and you could see me in action!

09:19.393 --> 09:20.661
Yeah.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.364
Think about it, just
me, you and the open road.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.264
It'll be fun.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.367
I wish I could but I can't.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.970
Mel, you gotta get outta here.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.172
You gotta go see things
and try things.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.007
Rather than just hiding
behind that apron

09:34.074 --> 09:37.611
like a depressed,
underweight Bobby Flay.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.213
Hey, if anything,
I'm a depressed,

09:39.279 --> 09:41.515
underweight Barefoot Contessa.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.084
And I'm not hiding,
I just can't afford

09:44.151 --> 09:46.120
to drop everything and leave.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.888
What if I split
my pay with you?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.624
You could share
the driving with me.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.826
It's illegal but who cares?

09:51.892 --> 09:55.362
They don't ever stop women.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.964
It'll be fun.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.465
I think you really need this.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.901
I'm sorry, I can't.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.071
Okay.

10:04.138 --> 10:06.306
And I do need you to get
out from behind the counter

10:06.373 --> 10:08.108
'cause it's a
health code violation.

10:08.175 --> 10:08.675
Oh, is it?

10:08.742 --> 10:09.777
Yeah.

10:09.844 --> 10:11.378
I do lose my hair
in chunks, so.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.312
Oh.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.515
I'll see you later.

10:24.491 --> 10:29.329
Brenda the Bonecrusher is
poised to win the nationals?

10:30.364 --> 10:33.200
Oh, goddammit, she does
look pretty hot there.

10:33.835 --> 10:35.502
This is a fucking good website.

10:36.270 --> 10:38.338
It's like she hired someone.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.207
God!

10:40.274 --> 10:41.942
God, she sucks!

10:42.643 --> 10:44.144
Shit!

11:03.096 --> 11:03.964
Ugh.

11:08.335 --> 11:13.507
Oh, not again!

11:19.680 --> 11:22.382
So Danny, how much do
you usually make

11:22.449 --> 11:24.218
on a Kansas City to Detroit run?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.687
I was doing some calculations
on my phone

11:26.753 --> 11:29.690
and I think that I can
keep the bakery closed

11:29.756 --> 11:30.591
for about a week?

11:30.657 --> 11:31.826
Okay.

11:31.893 --> 11:33.026
But I need to know how
much we're gonna make.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.463
Look Mel, don't worry
about it, okay?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.599
I don't know how much
we're gonna make.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.601
When we get there, they're
gonna look at the shipment,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.569
they're gonna factor
in the mileage

11:42.636 --> 11:45.138
and then from there tell
us how much we made.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.773
But trust me, it'll be enough.

11:46.841 --> 11:47.741
Okay.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.711
Okay, sounds good.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.578
Ow, shit.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.213
Are you in pain?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.014
What?

11:54.081 --> 11:54.849
Do you have some pills?

11:54.916 --> 11:55.917
- Like anything?
- Drugs?

11:55.984 --> 11:56.383
- No I don't have drugs.
- You got,

11:56.450 --> 11:58.552
Codeine?

11:58.619 --> 11:59.753
- No, I just said I don't.
- Morphine?

11:59.821 --> 12:01.221
No, I definitely
don't have morphine.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.556
Oh okay.

12:02.623 --> 12:05.058
You never know this day
and age with big Pharm.

12:05.927 --> 12:07.094
How did that happen anyway?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.730
I just got in a little
bar fight, it's chill.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.397
A bar fight?

12:10.464 --> 12:11.698
Yeah.

12:11.765 --> 12:12.299
How did you
get into a bar fight?

12:12.366 --> 12:13.534
Oh my god,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.503
there's a million ways
to get into a bar fight.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.405
You wanna hear my top three?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.240
I don't have a choice.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.375
No you don't.

12:21.441 --> 12:25.145
Number three,
classic just trip 'em.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.149
Oh, yes!

12:30.450 --> 12:32.386
Boom, you're in a bar fight.

12:33.554 --> 12:37.190
Number two,
steal someone's beer.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.393
And or their dude.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.662
Yeah, get up here, get up here.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.797
One second there.

12:43.865 --> 12:46.533
And number one,
my absolute favorite way

12:46.600 --> 12:47.768
to get into a bar fight.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.839
The nice and simple
flick 'em in the head.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.607
- Yeah!
- Oh my gosh.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.577
So which one was this one?

12:56.643 --> 12:57.979
Oh it was none of those.

12:58.046 --> 13:01.148
I got in a fight with this
chick I was arm wrestling.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.549
Arm wrestling, really?

13:02.616 --> 13:04.518
I didn't tell you about it

13:04.585 --> 13:08.288
because you think arm
wrestling is too aggro.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.556
I never said that.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.258
Yeah but your face did.

13:12.225 --> 13:12.659
Yeah.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.698
Look, all I'm saying is that
arm wrestling sounds dangerous.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.733
I mean you broke your wrist.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.301
Oh shit!

13:21.368 --> 13:22.102
You hear that?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.805
It's our favorite song!

13:25.907 --> 13:27.207
Here we go.

13:27.274 --> 13:32.145
♪ These dreams go on
when I close my eyes ♪

13:32.981 --> 13:36.483
♪ Every second of the night ♪

13:36.550 --> 13:39.286
♪ I live another life ♪

13:39.353 --> 13:41.221
♪ These dreams ♪

13:44.257 --> 13:44.892
Danny!

13:44.959 --> 13:45.759
What?

13:45.827 --> 13:46.928
Do you not know the words?

13:46.995 --> 13:49.196
No, I know the words,
I know the words.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.297
Don't worry about it.

13:50.364 --> 13:50.965
It's my favorite song.

13:51.032 --> 13:52.232
It's our song.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.468
I know, but you were
just going

13:54.534 --> 13:55.669
No, I'm singing along.

13:55.736 --> 13:56.536
I was singing along.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.205
You didn't say any consonants.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.439
I'm not a good singer,

13:59.506 --> 14:01.174
so yeah, I didn't enunciate.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.655
There's so
much room back here.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.923
Oh, yeah.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.925
So homey, I love what
you've done with it.

14:17.992 --> 14:19.226
Mhmm.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.930
And the rule is, guests
have to be the big spoon.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.799
Oh wait, we sleep back here?

14:25.867 --> 14:27.334
Yeah.

14:27.401 --> 14:28.970
That's why there's a bed, doi.

14:29.037 --> 14:30.370
We're gonna get
a little schnocker,

14:30.437 --> 14:31.873
come back here and spoon.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.774
Oh boy.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.784
This place is different.

14:43.851 --> 14:45.086
Yeah.

14:45.153 --> 14:46.921
You get
the fuck out of my bar!

14:46.988 --> 14:47.889
Hmm.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.190
Well.

14:51.425 --> 14:53.995
Look who the cat dragged in.

14:54.062 --> 14:55.562
Randy.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.697
Danny.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.398
So.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.436
I understand that you're here

15:02.502 --> 15:04.806
to take another shot
at your rep.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.207
I am.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.843
You gonna help me do that?

15:11.846 --> 15:13.547
See you at the table, ladies.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.548
Mhmm.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.749
What rep?

15:17.018 --> 15:19.286
My arm wrestling reputation.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.220
What is this?

15:22.622 --> 15:23.690
Ooh.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.560
Oh, shit!

15:26.626 --> 15:27.829
Do you think they have rose?

15:27.895 --> 15:30.530
No, absolutely not, let's go.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.698
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

15:31.765 --> 15:34.001
Yeah, yeah, it's my left,
it's fine.

15:34.068 --> 15:36.436
But it's the only
good one you have left.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.771
Danny?

15:37.839 --> 15:39.439
You're gonna let
Kate Middleton over here

15:39.506 --> 15:40.340
tell you what to do?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.076
Or are you gonna get serious?

15:42.143 --> 15:44.644
Aw, thank you.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.513
Is this serious
enough for you?

15:47.481 --> 15:48.381
Danny.

15:49.483 --> 15:50.550
What?

15:50.617 --> 15:51.718
I got this.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.820
Call it.

15:54.856 --> 15:56.690
Let's go, ladies.

15:56.757 --> 15:57.892
Center up.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.928
Let's keep it clean.

16:02.496 --> 16:04.098
You go on three.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.968
One, two, three.

16:09.804 --> 16:11.404
Oh wow, shit!

16:12.106 --> 16:14.341
My left is a piece of shit!

16:14.407 --> 16:15.042
Tough titty.

16:15.109 --> 16:16.043
Quit your whinin'.

16:16.110 --> 16:16.743
Thank you much.

16:16.811 --> 16:17.277
- God.
- Danny!

16:17.344 --> 16:18.411
What?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.247
What, you just spent
all your money

16:19.312 --> 16:21.615
on an arm wrestling match?

16:21.681 --> 16:22.315
Yeah.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.483
This is so dumb!

16:23.550 --> 16:24.417
What?

16:27.121 --> 16:28.488
Excuse me.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.422
Oh shit.

16:32.093 --> 16:34.427
Who are you calling dumb?

16:35.963 --> 16:36.898
I said fun.

16:36.964 --> 16:38.498
I said this is so fun.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.733
That doesn't rhyme with dumb.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.601
Yeah, you come into my bar

16:41.668 --> 16:44.404
and you tell me that I'm dumb?!

16:46.573 --> 16:47.875
I'm gonna rip you a new asshole.

16:47.942 --> 16:49.076
Please don't.

16:49.143 --> 16:49.743
Asshole!

16:49.811 --> 16:51.411
Yeah!

16:52.814 --> 16:54.581
Okay, all right, okay,

16:54.648 --> 16:56.884
everybody just chill out.

16:56.951 --> 17:01.088
I'm sure there's a way
that we could settle this

17:01.155 --> 17:03.690
without anybody
getting a new asshole

17:03.757 --> 17:06.928
unless they want it,
no judgment here.

17:06.994 --> 17:08.062
I love it.

17:08.129 --> 17:09.596
With an arm wrestling match.

17:09.663 --> 17:10.697
Yeah, what?

17:10.764 --> 17:11.531
Against her.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.266
No!

17:12.332 --> 17:14.634
Double or nothing.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.368
Shit.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.071
Don't make me laugh.

17:17.138 --> 17:19.472
No, I'm being serious.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.781
Fine.

17:27.849 --> 17:30.117
This is gonna be the
easiest money I ever won.

17:30.184 --> 17:31.651
- Yeah!
- Let's do this!

17:31.718 --> 17:32.920
Do we really have to do this?

17:32.987 --> 17:34.989
I think this is
our only chance

17:35.056 --> 17:37.691
at not getting our asses kicked.

17:37.757 --> 17:38.592
Okay.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.961
Okay, this is good, come on.

17:40.027 --> 17:41.361
Here we go.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.566
Yeah, take your money
out of your purse.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.802
Slam it down.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.004
Slam it down hard.

17:50.071 --> 17:52.173
Okay, what was it, that's cute.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.140
Yeah.

17:54.909 --> 17:55.977
Are there hooks?

17:56.043 --> 17:56.911
No, there aren't.

17:56.978 --> 17:57.945
I'll hold it.

17:58.012 --> 17:58.712
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.347
- Yup.
- Okay.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.081
Okay, great.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.216
Great, great, great.

18:02.283 --> 18:02.950
- Come on now.
- Has this been

18:03.017 --> 18:04.118
wiped down recently?

18:04.185 --> 18:05.987
What do you think?

18:06.053 --> 18:08.588
Let's not worry
about that, okay?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.524
All right, you got this.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.693
Are you ready?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.229
Yeah, no, yes.

18:15.296 --> 18:16.730
She's ready, she's ready,

18:16.796 --> 18:18.132
she's got this.

18:18.199 --> 18:20.001
This is on three.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.469
One, two, three.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.604
Come on, Mel, here we go,
here we go.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.538
Oh god.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.674
Pull doors, you Mel.

18:27.741 --> 18:28.575
Pull Mel, pull!

18:29.409 --> 18:30.477
What the fuck?!

18:31.745 --> 18:32.612
I'm so sorry.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.681
How the fuck did you do that?

18:35.649 --> 18:36.817
I don't know.

18:36.884 --> 18:37.852
I don't know.

18:37.919 --> 18:38.752
Well.

18:38.819 --> 18:40.054
We may just be in the presence

18:40.121 --> 18:41.822
of a golden arm.

18:41.889 --> 18:43.057
A what?

18:43.124 --> 18:45.226
We'll that's when
a woman like yourself,

18:45.293 --> 18:49.030
weak, ineffectual, soft, like a,

18:49.096 --> 18:51.531
A jellyfish.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.799
Okay, I get it.

18:52.867 --> 18:56.103
But she has got one
goddamn powerful arm.

18:59.941 --> 19:01.641
Well, thank you.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.843
Is that mine?

19:02.910 --> 19:03.743
- Mhm, yeah it is.
- Yes.

19:03.811 --> 19:05.846
Hold it, minus my 10 percent.

19:05.913 --> 19:07.614
Sure, I mean
you earned it, yeah.

19:07.681 --> 19:08.349
Yeah I did.

19:08.416 --> 19:09.083
Thank you so much.

19:09.150 --> 19:10.717
Thank you.

19:10.784 --> 19:12.585
This was honestly,

19:12.652 --> 19:13.486
Was it?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.621
Yeah.

19:14.688 --> 19:15.522
Danny, get the fuck
out of my bar.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.556
Okay, I'll see you.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.458
- You fuck yourself!
- So soon.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.193
You get the fuck out of here!

19:19.260 --> 19:20.328
Ah, shit!

19:20.394 --> 19:22.063
- Oh, my fucking kidney!
- Stop looking

19:22.129 --> 19:23.331
and keep drinking!

19:23.397 --> 19:24.932
- Danny, are you okay?
- Oh dear, holy shit.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.133
I'm fine.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.902
Wait, why are we
in the men's bathroom?

19:27.969 --> 19:29.070
I didn't know
where else to run.

19:29.136 --> 19:30.972
We could have run outside.

19:31.038 --> 19:31.839
I knew it!

19:31.906 --> 19:34.541
I knew you had a golden arm!

19:34.607 --> 19:35.810
Oh god, Danny,
that's so silly.

19:35.876 --> 19:39.180
You put a beatdown on
Randy Roadhouse Rollins!

19:39.246 --> 19:40.714
I got lucky.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.481
Oh, no, no, no.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.850
What you've got is a gift

19:42.917 --> 19:46.553
and we're taking that gift
to Oklahoma City, baby!

19:46.619 --> 19:48.956
Oklahoma, wait what about
Detroit and the shipment?

19:49.023 --> 19:50.690
Oh, there is no shipment.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.326
I lied to you, yeah.

19:52.393 --> 19:52.860
Danny!

19:52.927 --> 19:54.161
Yeah.

19:54.228 --> 19:57.832
I'm gonna have you fill in
for me at the Nationals!

19:59.033 --> 20:00.968
I mean your form is
pretty sloppy

20:01.035 --> 20:03.104
but we can get you some
training and you'll be,

20:03.170 --> 20:04.205
No, Danny.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.007
I'm not doing that,
that's insane.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.241
- I'm not doing Nationals.
- Oh really?

20:07.308 --> 20:08.009
- Really.
- Really?

20:08.075 --> 20:08.809
- Yeah.
- Huh?

20:08.876 --> 20:09.576
- Uh huh.
- Oh yeah?

20:09.642 --> 20:12.279
Is 15,000 dollars insane?

20:12.346 --> 20:14.248
'Cause that's the prize.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.156
Busted!

20:22.223 --> 20:23.257
Ew.

20:23.324 --> 20:26.894
We're going
to Nationals, baby.

20:26.961 --> 20:28.728
But first, we train.

20:30.197 --> 20:31.065
Woo hoo!

20:32.066 --> 20:34.101
Look at all that corn.

20:34.168 --> 20:34.969
That's not corn.

20:35.036 --> 20:35.903
What the hell is it, then?

20:35.970 --> 20:38.005
I think it's just tall grass.

20:38.072 --> 20:39.273
Tall grass?

20:39.340 --> 20:42.076
Uh-uh, tall grass has
never made me hungry.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.881
Hey.

20:46.947 --> 20:48.115
Do that.

20:48.182 --> 20:49.016
Okay, ready?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.117
Yeah.

20:51.085 --> 20:52.253
Aha!

20:52.319 --> 20:53.187
Ha, yeah!

20:53.254 --> 20:55.256
Yeah, baby!

20:55.322 --> 20:56.157
Mel.

20:56.223 --> 20:57.024
Can I do it?

20:57.091 --> 20:57.958
Give it a shot.

20:58.025 --> 20:59.293
Don't mess up.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.760
Yeah, just pull it.

21:07.234 --> 21:08.335
Okay, okay.

21:10.237 --> 21:11.738
That was fun.

21:12.306 --> 21:14.041
Where are we going to train?

21:14.108 --> 21:18.879
I got a little
special place, it's awesome.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.920
Huh.

21:31.025 --> 21:31.892
Haha!

21:31.959 --> 21:32.960
You brought me
to a strip club?

21:33.027 --> 21:35.429
No, it's a bikini bar,
it's classy.

21:35.496 --> 21:37.164
How is this training?

21:37.231 --> 21:39.100
Oh, you'll see.

21:53.414 --> 21:54.647
Big sexy.

21:55.182 --> 21:55.850
Who?

21:55.916 --> 21:57.151
A'ight, let's go.

21:57.218 --> 21:58.352
She founded the tournament

21:58.419 --> 22:01.889
and went undefeated
81 straight matches.

22:01.956 --> 22:04.258
She's retired now
and she only works

22:04.325 --> 22:07.094
with the champions.

22:07.161 --> 22:08.362
Woo!

22:08.429 --> 22:11.198
She's pretty much your
only chance at winning.

22:11.265 --> 22:13.134
Big Sexy!

22:13.200 --> 22:14.335
Dominator!

22:14.401 --> 22:15.635
Oho!

22:15.702 --> 22:18.372
Goddamn your name gets
more and more accurate!

22:18.439 --> 22:20.441
Look at you,
you put on some weight?

22:20.508 --> 22:22.143
I did, thank you for noticing.

22:22.209 --> 22:23.776
Nice work, friend.

22:27.214 --> 22:27.982
Is this her?

22:28.048 --> 22:28.916
Yeah.

22:28.983 --> 22:30.184
This is my best friend Melanie.

22:30.251 --> 22:31.852
Hi, so nice to meet you.

22:33.487 --> 22:34.754
Hmm.

22:52.106 --> 22:53.107
I don't think so, Danny.

22:53.174 --> 22:54.175
Sorry, bud.

22:54.241 --> 22:55.809
Wait, that's it?

22:55.876 --> 22:58.846
She doesn't have
the fight in her.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.949
And her whole aura's
piss yellow.

23:03.484 --> 23:05.953
Come on, you gotta
give her a chance.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.488
Melanie does have
the fight in her.

23:07.555 --> 23:10.891
It's just buried way
way way down there.

23:10.958 --> 23:14.261
And I know that
you are the only one

23:14.328 --> 23:15.963
that can get it out of her.

23:25.372 --> 23:27.774
Welcome to the shop, ladies.

23:27.841 --> 23:31.412
Okay, what pisses you off?

23:31.478 --> 23:32.012
What?

23:32.079 --> 23:33.080
I got one.

23:33.147 --> 23:35.516
Her name is Brenda
and she's a twat.

23:35.583 --> 23:36.951
Please don't say twat.

23:38.152 --> 23:42.223
Mine is, we're in Baghdad
in the shit.

23:43.023 --> 23:44.925
Snipers everywhere.

23:44.992 --> 23:47.895
We almost didn't
make it out alive.

23:47.962 --> 23:50.331
Medic!

23:50.397 --> 23:51.798
Oh, I got it.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.334
What, what is it?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.202
It's really similar to yours.

23:55.269 --> 23:56.837
Scones.

23:56.904 --> 23:58.072
In the trash.

23:59.306 --> 24:00.474
Excuse me?

24:00.541 --> 24:02.810
I keep telling Kristen,
the yoga instructor

24:02.876 --> 24:04.478
that if she doesn't
want a scone,

24:04.545 --> 24:06.247
she doesn't have to take one.

24:07.281 --> 24:08.349
But she always does.

24:08.415 --> 24:10.017
She takes one bite out of it

24:10.084 --> 24:12.820
and she throws it away.

24:12.886 --> 24:13.954
Every day.

24:15.422 --> 24:17.591
It really pisses me off.

24:17.658 --> 24:18.959
Okay, I mean I've never worked

24:19.026 --> 24:19.860
with something so mundane,

24:19.927 --> 24:21.962
but hey, let's give it a shot.

24:22.596 --> 24:24.498
Okay, shut your eyes.

24:24.565 --> 24:28.168
Now imagine that woman
is right here.

24:28.235 --> 24:32.473
And your anger is just
bubbling up from inside.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.509
And you've just
got to let it go.

24:35.576 --> 24:36.677
Oh, like Frozen.

24:36.744 --> 24:38.078
No, not like fucking
Frozen, dammit!

24:38.145 --> 24:41.181
Okay, you worked really
hard on those scones, right?

24:41.248 --> 24:42.449
Yeah I did.

24:42.516 --> 24:44.852
You put your blood,
sweat and tears into 'em.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.387
Yeah, it was my
grandmother's recipe!

24:46.453 --> 24:49.290
And she is a goddamn
sweetheart, right?

24:49.356 --> 24:50.491
Yeah.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.725
And you were really polite
and told her

24:51.791 --> 24:54.061
don't take one if you're
just gonna throw away.

24:54.128 --> 24:54.995
Right!

24:55.062 --> 24:57.164
But every day,
you walk outside

24:57.231 --> 25:00.067
and in that garbage
can, there's your scone,

25:00.134 --> 25:02.903
thrown away like
a nasty old ball of hair

25:02.970 --> 25:04.538
out of the shower drain.

25:04.605 --> 25:05.506
Ugh.

25:07.474 --> 25:08.342
Exactly.

25:10.077 --> 25:11.512
Now
how you feeling?

25:11.578 --> 25:14.348
I'm hot, sweaty.

25:14.415 --> 25:15.949
My pants are wet.

25:16.016 --> 25:16.850
Good, good.

25:16.917 --> 25:17.484
My heart's racing.

25:17.551 --> 25:18.385
Uh huh.

25:18.452 --> 25:19.620
Temples throbbing.

25:19.687 --> 25:22.289
That's good,
that's good, this is it.

25:22.356 --> 25:25.025
Okay, now imagine
that yoga bitch

25:25.092 --> 25:27.027
is standing right here.

25:27.094 --> 25:28.262
Mhmm.

25:28.329 --> 25:29.897
And she's
got one of your homemade

25:29.963 --> 25:31.565
delicious scones in her hand.

25:31.632 --> 25:32.666
Ooh, yummy.

25:32.733 --> 25:35.169
But wait,
what's that?

25:35.235 --> 25:37.104
She just crumpled it up

25:37.171 --> 25:39.840
and threw it in the trash!

25:41.141 --> 25:43.310
You ungrateful selfish jerk!

25:44.244 --> 25:46.647
If you step one more foot
into my shop,

25:46.714 --> 25:48.482
I'm gonna beat you
with your yoga mat

25:48.549 --> 25:51.185
that reeks like crotch stank!

25:51.251 --> 25:53.487
Come on lady, shut up!

25:53.554 --> 25:54.421
Hoo.

25:55.356 --> 25:56.924
Yeah.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.392
Okay, and now we work.

25:59.927 --> 26:00.728
I said crotch stank.

26:00.794 --> 26:01.328
That was awesome.

26:01.395 --> 26:02.229
It felt weird.

26:02.296 --> 26:04.264
Can I stay crotch stank now?

26:07.534 --> 26:08.702
Yeah!

26:08.769 --> 26:10.337
This is an official
arm wrestling table,

26:10.404 --> 26:12.706
42 inches tall, same as a bar.

26:12.773 --> 26:14.041
Why am I up here again?

26:14.108 --> 26:16.477
So for the next 60 seconds

26:16.543 --> 26:19.213
you have to maintain
that exact position.

26:19.279 --> 26:21.048
And you can't spill
a drop of beer

26:21.115 --> 26:22.716
no matter what comes at you.

26:22.783 --> 26:23.617
Got it.

26:24.618 --> 26:25.953
Ow!

26:26.019 --> 26:26.821
No.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.223
No, no, no, no.

26:30.157 --> 26:31.091
Just let her.

26:31.158 --> 26:31.860
What is this?

26:31.925 --> 26:32.593
It's like a little fit.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.027
Just let her get it out.

26:36.130 --> 26:37.431
- Come on!
- Come on, Mel,

26:37.498 --> 26:38.632
you got this!

26:38.699 --> 26:39.299
Push it!

26:39.366 --> 26:40.701
There you go!

26:40.768 --> 26:41.502
- Drive it through, come on!
- Come on, go a little!

26:41.568 --> 26:42.403
Now this is your peg.

26:42.469 --> 26:44.772
It's gonna be your stabilizer

26:44.839 --> 26:45.939
and you also can use it
for leverage.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.708
Square it up,
square it up over here.

26:47.775 --> 26:49.276
You can pull
right-handed or left

26:49.343 --> 26:51.044
but your elbow at all times

26:51.111 --> 26:53.147
has to stay anywhere
on this square.

26:53.213 --> 26:55.682
You can move it around,
you can't lift it up.

26:55.749 --> 26:56.517
- Come on!
- Kiss that pavement

26:56.583 --> 26:58.118
and then get away from it!

26:58.185 --> 27:00.120
- Now don't use your knees!
- Danny!

27:00.187 --> 27:03.323
Oh my god, her
shoes are on my pillow.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.759
Oh!

27:05.827 --> 27:06.393
You're gonna
get your grip.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.628
Mhmm.

27:07.694 --> 27:08.128
Squeeze
the thumb, pull it up.

27:08.195 --> 27:10.564
Oh.

27:10.631 --> 27:11.532
And watch your form,
straighten up the wrist.

27:11.598 --> 27:12.399
Come on girls.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.034
And be quick and explosive.

27:14.101 --> 27:14.935
You wanna get the jump.

27:15.002 --> 27:16.437
- Suck and tuck.
- Yeah.

27:16.503 --> 27:17.204
Excuse me?

27:17.271 --> 27:18.439
Exactly.

27:18.505 --> 27:21.241
You wanna go
and get on top of it.

27:21.308 --> 27:22.743
There you go, go!

27:22.811 --> 27:23.878
Come on, get in there,

27:23.944 --> 27:25.712
and don't let anybody get
cocky up there

27:25.779 --> 27:27.014
when you're getting your grip.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.416
You slip out of that,
you'll pull the straps.

27:29.483 --> 27:30.517
I got it.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.286
It can really mess up
your game.

27:32.352 --> 27:33.754
Especially if that buckle
ends up

27:33.822 --> 27:35.055
on the backside of your hand

27:35.122 --> 27:37.324
and your opponent can dig
their fingers into it.

27:37.391 --> 27:38.392
I mean I've see guys' hands
ripped open

27:38.459 --> 27:40.027
because of the metal.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.696
I have 15 world titles.

27:42.763 --> 27:45.466
And 81 straight matches won.

27:45.532 --> 27:47.768
No, it's like 600 and one.

27:47.836 --> 27:49.536
I lost one time.

27:49.603 --> 27:52.072
I got to face her again
and redeem myself.

27:52.139 --> 27:53.273
And as my momma said
get up there

27:53.340 --> 27:55.042
and break her goddamn arm.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.312
How do you avoid that?

27:58.378 --> 27:59.480
Broke arm position.

27:59.546 --> 28:01.181
That is where the wrist
is on the outside

28:01.248 --> 28:02.282
of the shoulder.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.383
Do you feel that pressure
right here?

28:03.450 --> 28:04.284
It takes eight pounds
of pressure

28:04.351 --> 28:06.653
to radial break your humerus.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.254
Go!

28:08.589 --> 28:11.191
You are spilling a
shit ton of beer, Mel.

28:11.258 --> 28:13.093
No, no, no, no, don't
you get back there.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.194
And you just keep working.

28:14.261 --> 28:15.729
Don't ever go
to losing position.

28:15.796 --> 28:16.831
Okay.

28:16.898 --> 28:18.532
You don't practice
being a loser!

28:19.666 --> 28:20.835
Yeah!

28:20.902 --> 28:23.537
Big Sexy said you have
to do 400 of these?

28:23.604 --> 28:24.271
And tuck!

28:24.338 --> 28:25.205
Should have been faster.

28:25.272 --> 28:27.174
Come on, get up, we ain't done.

28:27.241 --> 28:28.843
Go come on, get the jump.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.444
- Get the jump.
- There you go.

28:30.511 --> 28:32.079
Hit low, hit low.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.447
Fuck you, bag!

28:34.248 --> 28:35.282
Fuck you, bag!

28:35.349 --> 28:38.185
You're doing great, man,
I'm surprised.

28:38.252 --> 28:39.419
- Yes, Mel!
- Break her arm!

28:39.486 --> 28:40.387
- Come on, yes!
- You fucking got this, Mel!

28:40.454 --> 28:41.722
- You've got this!
- You got it!

28:41.788 --> 28:44.157
The only way I see you
winning this tournament

28:44.224 --> 28:45.860
is you gotta beat me
at least once.

28:45.927 --> 28:46.995
Got it.

28:47.060 --> 28:47.862
Come on,
get in there.

28:47.929 --> 28:49.496
Take my thumb, there you go.

28:49.563 --> 28:50.464
Ready?

28:52.834 --> 28:53.835
Yes.

28:53.902 --> 28:54.801
Yup.

28:55.870 --> 28:57.137
Go!

29:01.174 --> 29:02.075
Really?

29:03.377 --> 29:05.379
Come on, is that all you got?

29:08.282 --> 29:10.517
Something's blocking you,
I don't feel it.

29:14.454 --> 29:15.489
The fuck is this?

29:15.556 --> 29:17.391
- Shit up here?
- I'm doing my best.

29:17.457 --> 29:18.725
I don't think so.

29:20.327 --> 29:22.329
I can't do this shit.

29:22.396 --> 29:23.664
What?

29:23.730 --> 29:25.799
I think you're
the fucking problem.

29:27.434 --> 29:28.569
What are you doing?

29:34.608 --> 29:36.176
Hey!

29:36.243 --> 29:37.912
Would you just hold up?

29:37.979 --> 29:39.479
No, Danny.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.782
I am exhausted.

29:41.849 --> 29:46.453
My back hurts, I've got
motorcycle grease in my butt

29:46.520 --> 29:48.689
like I don't even know
how it got there.

29:48.755 --> 29:51.425
I can't do this!

29:51.491 --> 29:52.292
Are you serious?

29:52.359 --> 29:55.429
'Cause that looked badass, dude.

29:55.495 --> 29:56.697
I'm mad, okay?

29:56.763 --> 29:58.198
I am mad!

29:58.265 --> 30:00.434
Okay, good, be mad!

30:00.500 --> 30:03.503
But I know it is not
about the arm wrestling.

30:03.570 --> 30:06.206
So what is it about, Mel?

30:10.444 --> 30:13.815
I don't know.

30:13.881 --> 30:19.252
I don't know what I'm doing.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.691
I'm just so sick
of everyone else

30:24.758 --> 30:27.127
dictating my life, you know?

30:30.263 --> 30:34.201
I never put myself first.

30:34.768 --> 30:36.703
I don't listen to my gut.

30:38.472 --> 30:39.640
Like with Steve.

30:40.942 --> 30:44.211
When I first met him,
I didn't even like him.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.813
But he convinced me.

30:47.748 --> 30:49.416
And you told me
not to marry him.

30:49.483 --> 30:50.484
Sorry about that.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.185
No, you were right.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.454
I mean you could have
told me sooner

30:54.521 --> 30:56.790
than the day before our wedding.

30:56.858 --> 30:57.758
Yeah.

30:58.525 --> 30:59.693
I was pretty hammered.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.862
Yeah.

31:00.928 --> 31:04.297
Your grandma got me good.

31:05.666 --> 31:09.603
I wasted five years of
my life with that guy.

31:13.674 --> 31:16.911
What if every choice I
make is the wrong one?

31:16.978 --> 31:19.780
I mean everybody makes
wrong choices, Melanie.

31:19.847 --> 31:21.849
That's kind of the fun of life!

31:22.850 --> 31:25.652
And you listened to your
gut when you joined me

31:25.719 --> 31:27.521
on this trip, right?

31:27.587 --> 31:28.823
And look at you now,

31:28.890 --> 31:31.893
you're eat pray loving
the shit out of life!

31:31.959 --> 31:34.962
It's like the old Melanie's
coming back!

31:35.029 --> 31:39.666
Right now, what is your
gut telling you to do?

32:12.766 --> 32:13.800
I'm ready.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.304
I'll be the judge of that.

32:27.547 --> 32:28.448
Go!

32:59.679 --> 33:02.749
Woo!

33:09.090 --> 33:10.690
Oh shit, okay hold the wheel.

33:10.757 --> 33:11.324
- Come here.
- What?

33:11.391 --> 33:12.059
Take the wheel.

33:12.126 --> 33:13.161
What are you gonna do?

33:13.227 --> 33:14.262
- Why?
- We're coming up on this bar

33:14.327 --> 33:16.130
that you have
to show your tits to

33:16.197 --> 33:16.663
or you get bad luck on the road.

33:16.730 --> 33:17.265
What?

33:17.330 --> 33:17.899
Okay, take it.

33:17.965 --> 33:19.599
Okay, take it.

33:19.666 --> 33:20.500
There's them!

33:24.005 --> 33:24.771
Woo!

33:24.839 --> 33:26.673
Not having bad luck today!

33:39.619 --> 33:40.787
Hey, Danny?

33:40.855 --> 33:41.755
Yeah?

33:41.823 --> 33:43.958
I was thinking
about some stuff

33:44.025 --> 33:45.993
and I just wanna say I'm sorry.

33:46.793 --> 33:47.995
For what?

33:48.062 --> 33:50.898
You know, when you told
me not to marry Steve,

33:51.698 --> 33:54.334
I kind of shut you out.

33:56.103 --> 33:57.905
I just wanna say
I'm sorry for that.

33:57.972 --> 33:59.706
Oh, Mel, it's okay.

34:00.674 --> 34:02.977
I really missed you.

34:03.044 --> 34:05.545
I really missed you.

34:05.612 --> 34:06.446
- Good.
- Like a lot.

34:06.513 --> 34:07.747
Well no matter what happens

34:07.815 --> 34:10.784
I'm really glad that
we're doing this together.

34:10.852 --> 34:12.119
Just you and me.

34:36.911 --> 34:38.778
All right, we're here!

34:39.779 --> 34:40.647
This is it?

34:41.548 --> 34:43.851
Yeah, I know it doesn't look

34:43.918 --> 34:45.685
like much on the outside.

34:45.752 --> 34:47.554
But it's got everything, Mel.

34:48.622 --> 34:49.556
Like horses?

34:50.590 --> 34:51.725
What?

34:51.791 --> 34:52.994
No.

34:54.829 --> 34:58.632
Yeah, what's up?

34:59.267 --> 35:00.533
Oh here come's Lauren.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.870
She's a paramedic by day
and a lady puller by night.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.005
Lauren.

35:04.071 --> 35:04.839
Danny, hey.

35:04.906 --> 35:05.772
When's your first match?

35:05.840 --> 35:06.974
I'm the first one up tonight.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.042
Really?

35:08.109 --> 35:08.809
- Kill it!
- See you at the bar later.

35:08.876 --> 35:10.845
You know it.

35:10.912 --> 35:11.913
Geeta!

35:11.979 --> 35:14.015
Killer costume, dude.

35:14.081 --> 35:16.150
Geeta's a sixth grade
math teacher

35:16.217 --> 35:18.886
and just a beast in the arena!

35:18.953 --> 35:19.786
Wow.

35:19.854 --> 35:21.088
Oh, shit.

35:21.155 --> 35:22.789
That's Carl.

35:23.824 --> 35:25.893
He runs the entire competition.

35:27.694 --> 35:28.829
Hey Carl.

35:30.831 --> 35:31.765
Danny.

35:31.832 --> 35:32.900
You're looking good.

35:32.967 --> 35:34.268
Well you're not
looking too bad yourself.

35:34.335 --> 35:35.769
- Mmm.
- Hi, I'm Melanie.

35:35.836 --> 35:36.971
Top knot looking fierce.

35:37.038 --> 35:37.771
Stop it.

35:37.838 --> 35:39.040
You know what I like.

35:39.106 --> 35:40.207
Stop it.

35:40.274 --> 35:41.608
- No, I won't stop.
- Hi, I'm Melanie.

35:41.675 --> 35:42.276
Stop it.

35:42.343 --> 35:43.510
I can't stop.

35:43.576 --> 35:44.577
Mmm!

35:44.644 --> 35:45.478
- How's it looking in there?
- Hey.

35:45.545 --> 35:46.948
Oh, it looks so much better

35:47.014 --> 35:48.249
now that you're here.

35:48.316 --> 35:49.150
Mhmm.

35:49.216 --> 35:50.650
Ah, dominate me, Dominator.

35:50.717 --> 35:51.651
You wish.

35:53.888 --> 35:54.788
Holy shit.

35:56.123 --> 35:57.490
Hello, I'm Melanie.

35:58.725 --> 35:59.927
Bye, thank you.

35:59.994 --> 36:00.828
Ooh.

36:00.895 --> 36:03.763
Welcome to Star Arena, Mel.

36:03.831 --> 36:07.001
Tonight will be
packed with a bevy of beauties

36:07.068 --> 36:09.203
the likes of which
you've never seen.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.504
Featuring the lizard Geno.

36:12.273 --> 36:13.540
They look amazing.

36:13.606 --> 36:17.677
Skateboarding
dynamo, Tessie the Tank!

36:17.744 --> 36:18.712
- Yeah.
- The community is great.

36:18.778 --> 36:20.314
Everybody here is so rad.

36:20.381 --> 36:22.615
And the one
you've been waiting for,

36:22.682 --> 36:24.784
the three time
arm wrestling champ,

36:24.852 --> 36:25.518
What's wrong?

36:25.585 --> 36:26.287
Except for Brenda.

36:26.354 --> 36:29.522
Brenda the Bonecrusher!

36:30.157 --> 36:32.226
She'll crush your bones to dust.

36:32.293 --> 36:33.560
Why, what's wrong with Brenda?

36:33.626 --> 36:36.097
She's ruined the entire sport.

36:36.163 --> 36:38.966
She's like made it
just not as fun.

36:39.033 --> 36:40.835
She cheats a ton and

36:40.901 --> 36:42.269
she fucked up my arm

36:42.336 --> 36:44.271
and she fucking
hates French fries.

36:44.338 --> 36:46.673
Where it's like,
who hates French fries?

36:46.740 --> 36:48.075
They're so good!

36:48.142 --> 36:49.243
Danny.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.112
She's the one who
did that to your wrist?

36:51.178 --> 36:52.712
Yeah.

36:52.779 --> 36:53.981
That jerk!

36:54.048 --> 36:55.149
Whoah.

36:55.216 --> 36:57.018
I was kinda hoping
you'd say something

36:57.084 --> 36:59.286
like "That arm-jacking twat!"

36:59.353 --> 37:00.321
But that was pretty good.

37:00.388 --> 37:01.721
Please don't say twat.

37:01.788 --> 37:02.456
Okay.

37:02.522 --> 37:03.157
I hate that word.

37:03.224 --> 37:04.225
Okay, I'm sorry.

37:04.291 --> 37:07.094
All right, let's get you
registered, huh?

37:07.161 --> 37:08.628
- Hey, Dominator.
- Jerry!

37:08.695 --> 37:10.164
I checked you into the hotel.

37:10.231 --> 37:11.032
Thank you.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.834
And I got you hot towels.

37:13.901 --> 37:14.835
Clean your hands.

37:14.902 --> 37:15.870
Okay.

37:15.936 --> 37:16.904
Yeah.

37:16.971 --> 37:17.872
Sorry, who are you?

37:17.938 --> 37:19.073
Oh, I'm Jerry.

37:19.140 --> 37:21.708
I'm the Dominator's
sidekick assistant.

37:21.775 --> 37:23.610
Oh, I like sidekick,
dude.

37:23.676 --> 37:24.879
Let's keep that,
let's keep that.

37:24.945 --> 37:26.247
Here's my card if
you need to contact me.

37:26.313 --> 37:27.214
Oh.

37:27.281 --> 37:28.949
This is wet.

37:29.016 --> 37:31.118
Oh, it's probably just sweat.

37:31.185 --> 37:32.987
Yeah,
why are you so sweaty?

37:33.054 --> 37:34.721
It's so hot in here, right?

37:34.788 --> 37:36.323
Did you fix everything
in the room?

37:36.390 --> 37:37.224
Mhmm.

37:37.291 --> 37:38.092
- New sheets?
- Mhmm.

37:38.159 --> 37:39.592
- Fluff pillows?
- Mhmm.

37:39.659 --> 37:41.929
Did you leave the
shower running on full blast?

37:41.996 --> 37:42.897
Shit!

37:44.098 --> 37:45.032
I'll go drop this stuff

37:45.099 --> 37:45.933
- backstage, and then
- Okay.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.534
I'll go turn on the shower.

37:46.599 --> 37:48.402
He's the shit.

37:48.469 --> 37:50.137
He helps me do everything.

37:57.845 --> 37:59.113
I think I got this in the bag.

37:59.180 --> 38:03.417
I mean we got a mermaid, a
fucking lizard, a monkey.

38:03.484 --> 38:04.651
- Monkey?
- Danny, I'm just

38:04.717 --> 38:05.419
reading this over and
why do they need to know

38:05.486 --> 38:06.954
if I'm an organ donor?

38:07.021 --> 38:10.690
Oh like just in case somebody
needs an organ or something.

38:10.757 --> 38:13.060
Danny, Danny, Danny.

38:14.095 --> 38:15.329
You came to cheer me on!

38:15.396 --> 38:16.097
No.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.398
I came to watch you lose.

38:17.465 --> 38:18.765
Who's gonna beat me?

38:18.833 --> 38:21.001
You're out and I've beaten
every other bitch here.

38:21.068 --> 38:22.236
Not everyone.

38:22.303 --> 38:24.004
Right, Mel?

38:24.071 --> 38:25.206
- Come on.
- That's right.

38:26.507 --> 38:29.609
You don't actually mean
the American Girl doll?

38:30.911 --> 38:32.113
Yeah, right.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.316
I've seen bigger biceps
on a balloon animal.

38:36.450 --> 38:39.652
And I have seen a lot of
balloon animals.

38:42.389 --> 38:43.124
That's cool.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.225
No, seriously, Danny,

38:44.291 --> 38:46.093
you've done some
dumb shit in your time

38:46.160 --> 38:47.895
but this move,

38:47.962 --> 38:49.463
it goes into the
dumb shit hall of fame

38:49.530 --> 38:51.731
along right next to that hairdo.

38:51.798 --> 38:53.100
- Okay.
- Okay, no, no, no.

38:53.167 --> 38:54.201
No, no, no, no, Danny.

38:54.268 --> 38:55.302
- Don't let her get to you.
- Mel, Mel!

38:55.369 --> 38:57.004
I know, baby,
it's not worth it.

38:57.071 --> 38:58.105
Hey, f-bombs, f-bombs.

38:58.172 --> 38:59.373
Yeah.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.909
Okay, sweet cheeks,
can I tell you something?

39:02.543 --> 39:03.978
I was born to win.

39:06.013 --> 39:06.881
Okay.

39:08.449 --> 39:09.250
Thank you.

39:09.316 --> 39:10.985
Shake it.

39:11.051 --> 39:12.853
Shake her hand.

39:18.058 --> 39:18.926
Soft.

39:19.460 --> 39:22.196
Well, I wasn't trying.

39:22.263 --> 39:24.131
I wasn't trying to shake it.

39:24.198 --> 39:25.466
Are you ready?

39:25.533 --> 39:29.069
I am ready!

39:29.136 --> 39:30.070
What do you think?

39:31.172 --> 39:32.206
Why do I have to
wear a costume at all?

39:32.273 --> 39:35.342
You gotta put a show
on for the fans.

39:35.409 --> 39:37.444
You gotta find something
that like,

39:37.511 --> 39:39.813
shows your essence, you know?

39:42.116 --> 39:45.352
I like it,
but it's not intimidating.

39:45.419 --> 39:48.755
You are the cleaning lady!

39:48.822 --> 39:51.292
Like a sexy devil graduate?

39:51.358 --> 39:54.094
I don't know what's
intimidating and what's not.

39:54.161 --> 39:55.896
You are the pope!

39:55.963 --> 39:57.831
Is this sacrilegious?

39:57.898 --> 39:58.731
What about this, huh?

39:58.798 --> 40:00.767
That's just a bathing suit!

40:00.834 --> 40:01.635
Oh, shit, yeah.

40:01.701 --> 40:03.404
You would look hot in that!

40:03.470 --> 40:04.972
No!

40:05.573 --> 40:06.473
Oh.

40:06.540 --> 40:07.841
What is it?!

40:07.908 --> 40:11.145
I'm the ex-wife and I'm
gonna take half your stuff!

40:11.212 --> 40:12.913
By state law, I get to!

40:12.980 --> 40:14.982
Set it on fire or something.

40:15.049 --> 40:16.783
Well, no I'll try to sell it.

40:16.850 --> 40:17.451
Oh, this one's good.

40:17.518 --> 40:18.552
Okay.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.154
You
can't see my face.

40:20.221 --> 40:20.753
Ready?

40:20.821 --> 40:21.822
I'm ready.

40:21.889 --> 40:25.226
Give me
your camp goods!

40:25.292 --> 40:26.460
You're adorable!

40:26.527 --> 40:27.461
No!

40:27.528 --> 40:28.795
Yes!

40:28.862 --> 40:30.531
No, doesn't he look mad?

40:30.598 --> 40:33.367
But like in a cartoon way.

40:33.434 --> 40:34.501
You know?

40:34.568 --> 40:35.735
Where it's just like,
where's my honey?

40:35.803 --> 40:39.340
And you're like oh, what
a delight.

40:39.406 --> 40:40.107
Oh my god.

40:40.174 --> 40:41.008
What is it?

40:41.075 --> 40:41.575
Well something's biting me.

40:41.642 --> 40:42.576
Oh my god,

40:42.643 --> 40:43.210
- this thing's infested!
- Ew, ew!

40:43.277 --> 40:45.145
It's got eggs!

40:45.212 --> 40:46.046
Get it off me!

40:46.113 --> 40:46.981
Get it off!

40:47.047 --> 40:49.483
Oh fuck, it's got bugs in it!

40:53.621 --> 40:55.289
Ew!

40:55.356 --> 40:56.423
Eggs, oh god.

40:57.391 --> 40:58.325
Gah, blech.

41:09.069 --> 41:09.970
Danny?

41:11.405 --> 41:12.206
Oh.

41:12.273 --> 41:14.108
Oh my god, where are your pants?

41:14.174 --> 41:15.476
What, where are your pants?

41:15.542 --> 41:16.477
Oh, god!

41:16.543 --> 41:21.115
Oh, shit, okay, okay.

41:21.181 --> 41:23.317
I was supposed to
put this one on and,

41:25.019 --> 41:28.922
I was here to dress and
I just undressed, so,

41:28.989 --> 41:30.324
I'm sorry you have
a beautiful bod,

41:30.391 --> 41:32.493
well I mean I am not sorry
you have a beautiful body.

41:32.559 --> 41:33.627
You have a beautiful body.

41:33.694 --> 41:35.162
I'm sorry I saw it.

41:35.229 --> 41:36.997
I mean I'm not sorry
that I saw it.

41:37.064 --> 41:38.932
I mean what is great about it is

41:38.999 --> 41:43.270
my brain will remember it.

41:43.337 --> 41:45.072
I realize that
I'm in the wrong place.

41:45.139 --> 41:46.173
I thought I was
in the right place.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.143
Mel, I threw that shit
in the street.

41:49.209 --> 41:50.044
Greg!

41:50.110 --> 41:50.744
- Hi.
- What the hell

41:50.811 --> 41:53.480
am I walking into?

41:53.547 --> 41:55.282
Are we getting started
or ending?

41:55.349 --> 41:56.050
No, we're not.

41:56.116 --> 41:56.684
How are you, Danny?

41:56.750 --> 41:58.152
I'm good, Greg.

41:58.218 --> 42:01.522
Yeah I was wondering why
you weren't in the tournament.

42:01.588 --> 42:02.323
I got hurt.

42:02.389 --> 42:03.490
- What?
- Boom.

42:03.557 --> 42:04.792
- Oh, yeah!
- I know, I can't pull.

42:04.858 --> 42:06.960
You're usually at the
top of the leaderboard

42:07.027 --> 42:07.995
- at the beginning.
- Yeah, right?

42:08.062 --> 42:08.495
- This was my year.
- Danny, Danny!

42:08.562 --> 42:09.596
Oh!

42:09.663 --> 42:11.665
Sorry, yeah, right,
sorry ma'am.

42:11.732 --> 42:12.766
Danny, nice seeing you.

42:12.833 --> 42:14.435
Yeah, good to see you
too, Greg.

42:14.501 --> 42:15.669
You look good.

42:15.736 --> 42:17.471
Ah, thank you.

42:17.538 --> 42:18.639
He looks good, Mel.

42:18.706 --> 42:19.673
And you look good.

42:19.740 --> 42:21.008
No.

42:21.075 --> 42:24.078
Hey, you need to pick
out an outfit right now

42:24.144 --> 42:26.280
'cause your first bout's
in 30 minutes!

42:32.119 --> 42:34.355
Ack, god, what is that?

42:34.421 --> 42:35.689
Tea tree oil.

42:35.756 --> 42:37.458
It's just tea tree oil?

42:37.524 --> 42:39.259
I don't think you're supposed
to eat that.

42:39.326 --> 42:41.295
Okay Mel,
you're fine, all right?

42:41.362 --> 42:43.063
You're in the eastern bracket.

42:43.130 --> 42:45.132
And that bonehead bitch Brenda,

42:45.199 --> 42:46.533
she's in the western bracket.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.303
But I don't want you to
think about that right now.

42:49.370 --> 42:51.638
What I need for you
to do is to focus

42:51.705 --> 42:53.574
on your first bout, okay?

42:55.542 --> 42:57.344
Oh, shit, I know that face.

42:57.411 --> 42:58.545
Jerry, trash can!

43:00.547 --> 43:01.782
Oh, yipes!

43:01.850 --> 43:04.485
See, I told you that I'm
an expert at reading face.

43:04.551 --> 43:05.185
I threw up.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.553
Yeah, it's okay.

43:06.620 --> 43:08.622
He gave me tea tree oil.

43:10.090 --> 43:10.859
Jerry?!

43:10.924 --> 43:12.226
I'm sorry, maybe a mint?

43:12.292 --> 43:13.327
- Mint would probably be better.
- Yeah, take a mint.

43:13.394 --> 43:15.262
- I don't trust him.
- Take a mint.

43:15.329 --> 43:17.398
I wish Big Sexy were here.

43:17.464 --> 43:18.132
Okay.

43:18.198 --> 43:19.400
Okay, that's great.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.969
And what do you think
she'd say to you, huh?

43:22.035 --> 43:25.105
She would say Mel, stand up!

43:25.172 --> 43:29.143
Now you have to go
out there balls out!

43:29.209 --> 43:30.411
So it's time now.

43:30.477 --> 43:34.515
It's time for you to go
out there and balls out!

43:34.581 --> 43:36.483
Why would you say that?

43:37.751 --> 43:39.686
Oh,
to like pump her up.

43:41.088 --> 43:43.090
That's not how
you pump someone up.

43:43.157 --> 43:44.425
You gotta get it right.

43:46.727 --> 43:47.428
Now I don't wanna assume,

43:47.494 --> 43:49.129
but you don't have balls.

43:49.196 --> 43:50.130
You got labia.

43:50.197 --> 43:50.998
You're right.

43:51.064 --> 43:51.833
If you wanna get technical.

43:51.900 --> 43:54.067
Oh, I do, I'm an OB-GYN.

43:54.134 --> 43:54.601
That's my day job.

43:54.668 --> 43:55.837
Oh.

43:55.904 --> 43:58.672
And I've seen a lot
of labia in my day.

43:58.739 --> 44:00.174
All kinds!

44:00.240 --> 44:04.144
Small, tall, loud, shy.

44:04.211 --> 44:06.146
I've seen a spider
come out of one.

44:06.213 --> 44:08.282
I probably shouldn't have
said that.

44:09.616 --> 44:11.718
But you know what
they all have in common?

44:11.785 --> 44:13.187
Uh-uh.

44:13.253 --> 44:14.488
They're strong!

44:15.422 --> 44:18.025
Much stronger
than a set of balls!

44:18.692 --> 44:19.793
- Yeah, yes.
- Yeah.

44:19.861 --> 44:23.464
Our labia can withstand
tons of things!

44:23.530 --> 44:24.331
Yeah, right.

44:24.398 --> 44:25.799
Much more than a delicate pair

44:25.867 --> 44:28.235
of little underwear plums.

44:28.302 --> 44:30.304
As an OB-GYN, you call
them underwear plums?

44:30.370 --> 44:32.172
I try to keep it
out of the office.

44:32.239 --> 44:33.073
Sure.

44:33.140 --> 44:33.908
Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:33.974 --> 44:35.108
Men always say balls out

44:35.175 --> 44:36.677
but do you think a man
would do something

44:36.743 --> 44:38.712
that would tear his balls?

44:38.779 --> 44:40.080
No, would you?

44:40.147 --> 44:41.148
No.

44:41.215 --> 44:43.183
Even a flick would
ruin your day.

44:43.250 --> 44:45.185
And you can flick labia.

44:45.252 --> 44:46.753
- Hell yeah you can.
- I love it!

44:46.821 --> 44:47.521
I love it!

44:47.588 --> 44:48.755
Mel!

44:48.823 --> 44:51.492
You can't go out there
with your balls out!

44:51.558 --> 44:54.595
You gotta get out there
with your labes out!

44:54.661 --> 44:55.629
Yeah!

44:55.696 --> 44:56.931
- Labes out!
- Labes out, yeah!

44:56.997 --> 45:01.134
Labes out,
labes out, labes out,

45:01.201 --> 45:02.102
labes out!

45:05.272 --> 45:09.510
It's time for our next match!

45:10.177 --> 45:12.212
You're here for carnage!

45:12.279 --> 45:14.081
You're here for warfare!

45:14.147 --> 45:17.651
You're here for
the sport of queens!

45:17.718 --> 45:20.621
In this corner,

45:21.221 --> 45:23.223
she is no angel!

45:23.290 --> 45:25.025
The queen of pop,

45:25.759 --> 45:27.594
and by pop I mean she'll pop

45:27.661 --> 45:30.163
your damn arm out the socket!

45:30.230 --> 45:33.433
Beat-Ya-Down-Ce!

45:34.535 --> 45:38.071
And in this corner,

45:45.312 --> 45:46.179
Yeah!

46:06.968 --> 46:08.368
Come on, let's go,
you got this.

46:08.435 --> 46:09.636
You got this!

46:10.872 --> 46:12.739
You picked like the
weirdest part of the song

46:12.807 --> 46:13.473
to come out to.

46:13.540 --> 46:14.675
Really?

46:14.741 --> 46:15.843
It's okay.

46:15.910 --> 46:17.544
You got this, go.

46:19.746 --> 46:22.182
First of all,
I love this song.

46:22.249 --> 46:23.283
But what's your vibe?

46:23.350 --> 46:24.418
What's your persona?

46:24.484 --> 46:26.720
Oh, I'm totally freaked out.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.157
Okay.

46:30.223 --> 46:34.761
We have Freaked Out!

46:36.864 --> 46:37.966
Hey, that's on you.

46:38.032 --> 46:39.399
You didn't give me
enough to work with.

46:39.466 --> 46:40.500
Yeah, sorry.

46:42.502 --> 46:45.105
Okay, you
got this, you got this!

46:55.917 --> 46:56.783
Ready?

46:58.853 --> 46:59.753
Set!

47:03.790 --> 47:04.791
Holy shit!

47:04.859 --> 47:06.393
We have an upset!

47:06.460 --> 47:09.262
The winner is Freaked Out!

47:09.329 --> 47:10.764
Oh, you did it!

47:12.366 --> 47:13.300
You won!

47:13.367 --> 47:14.836
You won!

47:17.671 --> 47:19.239
We got a new star
in the scene.

47:19.306 --> 47:20.240
How are you feeling?

47:20.307 --> 47:21.274
Bathroom.

47:22.944 --> 47:24.311
Yeah!

47:24.378 --> 47:25.278
Bathroom!

47:26.313 --> 47:28.448
Bathroom!

47:28.515 --> 47:29.449
Bathroom!

47:29.516 --> 47:30.717
Yeah!

47:30.784 --> 47:31.685
Call me.

47:33.054 --> 47:34.321
That's creepy.

47:34.388 --> 47:38.659
Our first upset of the
tournament by Freaked Out.

47:38.725 --> 47:40.627
My god, Mel,
that was so cool!

47:40.694 --> 47:42.429
It felt so good.

47:42.496 --> 47:43.630
Yeah, it looked good.

47:43.697 --> 47:45.432
All this power
came up inside me

47:45.499 --> 47:46.600
and I just bam!

47:46.667 --> 47:48.301
Yes, oh my god!

47:48.368 --> 47:49.070
- It was awesome.
- Okay.

47:49.137 --> 47:51.605
Here's to my best friend,

47:51.672 --> 47:53.740
my kidney donor
if I should ever need one

47:53.808 --> 47:56.010
which doctors
are saying probably.

47:56.077 --> 47:57.177
Danny.

47:57.244 --> 48:00.547
The Al Pacino
to my Robert De Niro.

48:00.614 --> 48:01.581
Oh!

48:01.648 --> 48:03.517
Hey, let me ask you.

48:03.583 --> 48:05.019
Hey, I want, hey da.

48:05.086 --> 48:05.853
Hey there.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.255
Their faces like wind fed.

48:08.321 --> 48:10.424
Well, to you, Mel.

48:10.490 --> 48:12.192
- Cheers.
- Ooh yeah!

48:13.027 --> 48:13.928
Mmm.

48:15.429 --> 48:18.498
So what kind of crazy are we
gonna get into tonight, huh?

48:18.565 --> 48:19.834
I just want a nice hot bath.

48:19.901 --> 48:23.603
I just wanna relax and just
like sort of decompress.

48:23.670 --> 48:24.538
What?

48:24.604 --> 48:25.672
Self-care.

48:26.808 --> 48:29.776
No, Mel, we're here
to like have fun.

48:29.844 --> 48:30.510
I know.

48:30.577 --> 48:31.511
And you just won.

48:31.578 --> 48:33.513
- I know.
- So it's kind of now

48:33.580 --> 48:35.682
just like, hey go have fun.

48:35.749 --> 48:36.683
Right.

48:36.750 --> 48:37.784
Oh shit.

48:37.852 --> 48:39.453
A bath to me
is really fun.

48:39.519 --> 48:40.988
There's Greg.

48:42.489 --> 48:45.425
Uh oh, hey Greg.

48:45.492 --> 48:46.393
Hey.

48:47.494 --> 48:50.297
He's cute
and he's walking over.

48:50.363 --> 48:50.832
Stop, stop.

48:50.898 --> 48:52.066
Stop.

48:52.133 --> 48:53.134
Play it cool, play
it cool, play it cool.

48:53.201 --> 48:55.569
- Hey, man, what's up?
- Hey, hey.

48:55.635 --> 48:56.703
How are you?

48:56.770 --> 48:57.471
Good.

48:57.537 --> 48:58.505
- Good.
- Good.

48:58.572 --> 48:59.573
Hey.

48:59.639 --> 49:02.076
I never formally
introduced myself

49:02.143 --> 49:04.578
when we were in our
undies or whatever.

49:04.644 --> 49:05.579
Right.

49:05.645 --> 49:06.546
I'm Greg.

49:06.613 --> 49:07.882
I'm Melanie.

49:07.949 --> 49:08.749
Yeah.

49:08.816 --> 49:09.549
Nice to meet you.

49:09.616 --> 49:11.585
Nice to meet you too.

49:11.651 --> 49:12.820
Danny, nice to see you.

49:12.887 --> 49:14.922
Good to see you too.

49:14.989 --> 49:17.491
Do you guys want a drink?

49:18.525 --> 49:19.493
Oh, sure, yeah.

49:19.559 --> 49:20.460
Yeah?

49:21.561 --> 49:22.462
Ah.

49:24.564 --> 49:25.833
I just got tired.

49:25.900 --> 49:26.901
I just got tired

49:26.968 --> 49:28.735
so I think I'm gonna
get out of here.

49:28.802 --> 49:30.872
I'ma go take a nice hot bath,

49:30.938 --> 49:32.006
just relax, you know,

49:32.073 --> 49:34.741
'cause that's
the cool thing to do.

49:34.809 --> 49:35.509
- Yeah draw a bath.
- So I'm a go,

49:35.575 --> 49:37.477
I'm gonna draw a bath.

49:37.544 --> 49:40.480
But you two hang out, get wild.

49:40.547 --> 49:41.748
She wants to get a little wild.

49:41.816 --> 49:42.482
Oh no.

49:42.549 --> 49:44.451
Yeah you do, have fun.

49:44.518 --> 49:45.418
Have fun.

49:47.822 --> 49:48.789
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:48.856 --> 49:49.523
She's great.

49:49.589 --> 49:50.825
Yeah, she's great.

49:50.892 --> 49:53.560
Yeah, I mean this
was her year, you know?

49:53.627 --> 49:55.295
Yeah, I bet.

49:56.864 --> 49:59.499
I'm here to work, but,

49:59.566 --> 50:00.333
- You are.
- Yeah.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.535
Right, you're a referee.

50:01.601 --> 50:02.669
I am, yeah.

50:02.736 --> 50:03.737
That's what I was
trying to change into.

50:03.805 --> 50:04.872
- I was trying to
- I know I'm so

50:04.939 --> 50:06.908
- sorry about that.
- Tell you about that.

50:06.974 --> 50:07.507
- In the moment.
- I'm so sorry.

50:07.574 --> 50:08.375
No, I'm sorry.

50:08.441 --> 50:10.644
I'm still sorry.

50:10.710 --> 50:11.478
Thanks, can I

50:11.545 --> 50:12.246
- do this?
- Please, please.

50:12.312 --> 50:13.613
Yes, it was very fun.

50:16.851 --> 50:18.552
You look good in clothes.

50:20.988 --> 50:22.056
- So do you.
- I'm sorry.

50:22.857 --> 50:23.723
Thank you.

50:23.790 --> 50:24.691
Thank you.

50:24.758 --> 50:25.659
Hey.

50:26.593 --> 50:28.129
To wearing clothes.

50:28.196 --> 50:29.596
Yes.

50:29.663 --> 50:30.564
Or maybe not.

50:31.731 --> 50:32.532
Oh.

50:32.599 --> 50:34.401
I'm actually an umpire.

50:34.467 --> 50:35.602
Oh.

50:35.669 --> 50:37.437
Yeah, for
Major League Baseball.

50:37.504 --> 50:38.405
But what about you?

50:38.471 --> 50:39.739
What are you into?

50:39.807 --> 50:40.875
Do you wanna
get a pretzel?

50:40.942 --> 50:42.076
Yeah, yeah.

50:42.143 --> 50:43.945
'Cause I kinda have
a thing for bread.

50:44.011 --> 50:46.746
Oh, oh I love things
for bread.

50:46.814 --> 50:47.647
Do you?

50:47.714 --> 50:48.582
Yeah.

50:49.884 --> 50:51.551
Yeah, I really love it.

50:51.618 --> 50:53.587
I actually have my own bakery.

50:53.653 --> 50:54.788
Oh, that's awesome.

50:54.856 --> 50:57.524
Danny says that if
bread were a person

50:57.591 --> 51:00.828
I'd make sweet love
to it all night long.

51:00.895 --> 51:02.830
Or, she does say that

51:02.897 --> 51:04.698
but I probably shouldn't
have said that.

51:04.764 --> 51:05.665
Wow, then

51:05.732 --> 51:06.633
- one pretzel please.
- Hi.

51:06.700 --> 51:09.871
Okay.

51:09.937 --> 51:11.705
When I say Tabasco,
I want Tabasco,

51:11.771 --> 51:12.807
I want it to be hot.

51:12.874 --> 51:13.673
I know.

51:13.740 --> 51:15.977
I'm sorry I got some chili hoot.

51:16.043 --> 51:16.878
Go ahead?

51:16.944 --> 51:18.012
Uh oh.

51:20.181 --> 51:24.051
So, would you, you know,

51:24.118 --> 51:25.552
the pretzel or?

51:26.553 --> 51:29.489
Hmm, I'd definitely
invite it up.

51:29.556 --> 51:30.624
Oh.

51:31.192 --> 51:32.960
So it's got a chance.

51:33.027 --> 51:34.061
Yeah.

51:34.128 --> 51:34.862
- Wow.
- Got a pretty good chance.

51:34.929 --> 51:35.930
- I mean.
- Okay.

51:35.997 --> 51:38.165
It's not
a guarantee.

51:38.232 --> 51:39.066
Takes a little bit
more work, but

51:39.133 --> 51:40.800
I'm sure that,

51:40.868 --> 51:42.469
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

51:42.535 --> 51:43.237
I'm so sorry.

51:43.304 --> 51:44.604
I'll talk to you soon.

51:44.671 --> 51:45.873
It's not.

51:45.940 --> 51:48.675
I wasn't trying to say
that I'm the pretzel.

51:48.742 --> 51:51.478
Ooh my god, Jesus Christ!

51:51.544 --> 51:53.546
- Danny.
- Close your eyes!

51:53.613 --> 51:54.547
Close your eyes.

51:54.614 --> 51:55.283
Okay.

51:55.349 --> 51:56.483
Okay, fake by far.

51:56.549 --> 51:57.450
Where'd you go?

51:58.386 --> 51:59.619
- Ooh, where'd you go?
- Marco!

51:59.686 --> 52:00.587
Ooh, Polo!

52:00.654 --> 52:02.722
Uh oh, Marco!

52:02.789 --> 52:04.225
Ooh, Polo.

52:04.292 --> 52:05.826
Marco.

52:05.893 --> 52:07.094
Oooh, Polo!

52:08.662 --> 52:10.197
Marco.

52:10.264 --> 52:11.065
Ooh, bitch I won!

52:11.132 --> 52:13.067
Yeah, yeah, oh shit, yeah.

52:13.134 --> 52:14.168
This is my room.

52:14.235 --> 52:16.170
Rip my coat off
and grab my titty.

52:16.237 --> 52:17.138
Well that's good.

52:17.204 --> 52:17.771
Yeah there it is.

52:17.838 --> 52:18.940
Yeah, here we go.

52:19.006 --> 52:19.407
Yeah ooh,
I like the left one.

52:19.472 --> 52:20.107
Ooh.

52:20.174 --> 52:20.707
Get rid of this.

52:20.774 --> 52:22.944
Get on me, baby!

52:23.010 --> 52:23.643
Oof!

52:23.710 --> 52:24.744
Danny?

52:24.812 --> 52:25.478
This?

52:25.545 --> 52:27.181
Oh, fuck!

52:27.248 --> 52:28.816
What's happening?

52:28.883 --> 52:29.549
Carl?

52:29.616 --> 52:30.318
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:30.384 --> 52:31.252
Yeah, you know Carl.

52:31.319 --> 52:32.119
What are you doing?

52:32.186 --> 52:35.856
We're just gonna have sex.

52:35.923 --> 52:36.958
No.

52:37.024 --> 52:38.059
What?

52:38.125 --> 52:38.926
Okay.

52:38.993 --> 52:39.961
Hear me out.

52:40.027 --> 52:41.095
Threesome.

52:41.162 --> 52:42.997
I'm down.

52:43.064 --> 52:43.797
Yeah!

52:43.864 --> 52:44.832
I'm not in!

52:44.899 --> 52:46.167
- Come on, Mel.
- Oh, come on.

52:46.233 --> 52:47.134
Out!

52:47.201 --> 52:49.103
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Out!

52:49.170 --> 52:50.905
Okay.

52:50.972 --> 52:52.073
I don't wanna go.

52:52.139 --> 52:53.640
I don't want you to go either

52:53.707 --> 52:54.875
but you got to.

52:56.010 --> 52:57.011
I'll see you soon.

52:57.078 --> 52:57.912
You promise?

52:57.979 --> 52:58.980
Yeah I promise.

53:00.348 --> 53:02.216
I dream about you often.

53:03.951 --> 53:05.785
Not!

53:07.388 --> 53:08.956
I dream about him often.

53:12.026 --> 53:13.227
Did you have fun?

53:13.294 --> 53:15.196
I had a blast, how about you?

53:15.262 --> 53:17.664
How'd everything go with Greg?

53:17.731 --> 53:19.000
It was nice.

53:19.066 --> 53:20.034
It was nice?

53:20.101 --> 53:25.139
Did you guys like,
you know, do it?

53:25.206 --> 53:26.941
No we didn't do it.

53:27.008 --> 53:27.908
You didn't do it?

53:27.975 --> 53:29.076
No!

53:29.143 --> 53:30.044
Come on, Mel,
why didn't you do it?

53:30.111 --> 53:33.247
We were out for
like 30 minutes.

53:33.314 --> 53:35.116
That's plenty of time.

53:35.182 --> 53:37.717
You could probably
do it like twice.

53:38.785 --> 53:39.987
Or whatever.

53:40.054 --> 53:41.621
I don't know, Danny.

53:41.688 --> 53:42.522
Okay.

53:42.589 --> 53:43.757
I've never done this before.

53:43.824 --> 53:45.126
Isn't it fun though?

53:45.192 --> 53:45.893
It's fun.

53:45.960 --> 53:46.994
It's pretty fun, right?

53:47.061 --> 53:47.862
It's confusing,
I don't know what to do.

53:47.928 --> 53:51.032
I'm confused most of the time.

53:51.098 --> 53:52.166
I don't know.

53:52.233 --> 53:53.267
And it's fun like,

53:53.334 --> 53:55.870
it's fun if you're
into hooking up

53:55.936 --> 53:57.138
and then being done

53:57.204 --> 53:58.305
or if you're into hooking up

53:58.372 --> 54:00.841
and being like,
do we keep hooking up?

54:00.908 --> 54:04.311
Like that's the best
part of it, yeah.

54:04.378 --> 54:07.882
One and done or one and
let's have some more fun?

54:07.948 --> 54:08.648
One and fun.

54:10.151 --> 54:11.218
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

54:11.285 --> 54:12.286
No.

54:12.353 --> 54:13.921
Yes.

54:15.956 --> 54:16.656
Okay Mel.

54:16.723 --> 54:17.858
Goodnight.

54:17.925 --> 54:18.959
Night, Mel.

54:23.097 --> 54:24.697
Mel?

54:27.700 --> 54:28.369
Mel?

54:28.436 --> 54:29.236
What, Danny?

54:29.303 --> 54:31.305
Oh, are you awake?

54:31.372 --> 54:32.339
Yes.

54:32.406 --> 54:34.674
Will you tell me
a story?

54:34.741 --> 54:36.410
What do you
wanna hear?

54:36.477 --> 54:39.380
I wanna hear
the plot to Twister.

54:39.447 --> 54:41.382
The director's cut.

54:41.449 --> 54:43.250
Okay.

54:43.317 --> 54:46.686
Well, Helen Hunt is a scientist.

54:52.725 --> 54:54.862
And there's a twister.

55:05.005 --> 55:08.042
So, you got a thing
for Greg, huh?

55:09.176 --> 55:10.277
What?

55:10.344 --> 55:11.611
Yeah I saw you two last night

55:11.678 --> 55:14.714
hovering over your carbs
with all the other fatties.

55:15.816 --> 55:19.686
You know, pretzels metabolize
straight into sugar.

55:19.752 --> 55:20.855
- Oh.
- Oh no.

55:20.921 --> 55:21.956
Keep eating 'em.

55:22.022 --> 55:23.924
You'll be exhausted
at the table.

55:23.991 --> 55:25.025
Yeah.

55:25.092 --> 55:27.294
Well I'm just trying
to get ready.

55:27.361 --> 55:29.230
Not that
it even matters.

55:29.296 --> 55:32.765
Greg would never
be into a girl like you.

55:32.833 --> 55:36.937
Greg likes strong women.

55:37.872 --> 55:39.173
I'm a strong woman.

55:47.780 --> 55:49.250
I can smell your fear.

55:51.352 --> 55:52.920
That's confidence.

55:53.454 --> 55:54.721
I'm confident.

55:56.789 --> 55:58.959
You're smelling my confidence.

56:00.961 --> 56:03.696
Enjoy your stretch, princess.

56:10.938 --> 56:12.940
Hmm.

56:15.209 --> 56:16.243
Ready, set.

56:18.078 --> 56:18.979
Go.

56:21.315 --> 56:22.216
Winner!

56:32.960 --> 56:35.996
Freaked Out continues
to rise up the ranks.

56:37.831 --> 56:39.466
I won, I won!

56:39.533 --> 56:40.767
Yeah, yeah!

56:40.834 --> 56:42.469
Okay, so after the prelims

56:42.536 --> 56:45.206
we go into single elimination.

56:45.272 --> 56:46.440
That's big time.

56:46.507 --> 56:48.342
But she's killing it right now

56:48.409 --> 56:49.276
so I think if she's just-

56:49.343 --> 56:49.843
- Hey, hey.

56:49.910 --> 56:51.011
Hey Mel.

56:51.078 --> 56:53.180
We're just looking
at the prelim stuff

56:53.247 --> 56:54.448
and you are killing it!

56:54.515 --> 56:58.352
Look at you, your name
is just moving up, ah!

56:58.419 --> 57:00.187
It's so cool!

57:00.254 --> 57:01.088
Yeah.

57:01.155 --> 57:02.256
Oh god, oh god, get rid of it.

57:02.323 --> 57:03.424
Get rid of it!

57:03.490 --> 57:04.791
Jerry, get rid of it!

57:05.926 --> 57:06.726
Wait, why are
we getting rid of it?

57:06.793 --> 57:07.928
Because Greg's over there.

57:07.995 --> 57:11.565
I didn't tell Greg
that I'm Freaked Out.

57:11.632 --> 57:13.500
Uh,
it's pretty obvious.

57:13.567 --> 57:16.403
Yeah, I don't know
why I didn't tell him.

57:16.470 --> 57:19.039
Mel, do you like him?

57:20.207 --> 57:21.275
Yeah.

57:21.342 --> 57:22.543
And you wanna see
him again, huh?

57:22.610 --> 57:23.544
Yes.

57:23.611 --> 57:25.279
Mhmm, mhmm.

57:25.346 --> 57:27.114
Well listen to your instincts.

57:27.181 --> 57:30.150
Go over there and ask
him out on a real date.

57:31.552 --> 57:32.152
Come on.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.222
I'm not telling you to
marry him or anything.

57:35.289 --> 57:36.824
Go have fun.

57:36.890 --> 57:37.925
Yeah.

57:38.892 --> 57:40.361
Should I go take a shower first?

57:40.427 --> 57:41.996
Don't worry, Jerry's on it.

57:42.062 --> 57:42.830
Oh!

57:42.896 --> 57:43.430
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.

57:43.497 --> 57:44.198
Aluminum free.

57:44.265 --> 57:47.234
Yeah, I made it myself.

57:47.301 --> 57:49.436
Out of whale blubber.

57:55.576 --> 57:57.278
So you're in
the baseball world.

57:57.344 --> 57:58.712
Yes.

57:58.778 --> 58:01.148
I'm curious to know your
thoughts on baseball movies.

58:01.215 --> 58:02.383
Oh.

58:02.449 --> 58:04.151
Are you for them,
are you against them?

58:04.218 --> 58:04.784
I am for them.

58:04.852 --> 58:05.686
I am for them.

58:05.753 --> 58:06.954
You're pro baseball movies.

58:07.021 --> 58:08.289
I'm pro baseball movie,
for the entertainment.

58:09.356 --> 58:12.493
So like the comedies, like
Major League, love it.

58:12.559 --> 58:13.360
Love Major League.

58:13.427 --> 58:15.029
Love me some Major League.

58:15.095 --> 58:16.297
Rookie of the Year?

58:16.363 --> 58:17.264
Of course.

58:17.331 --> 58:19.400
Guilty pleasure.

58:19.466 --> 58:20.301
- Let me guess.
- On me.

58:20.367 --> 58:21.268
Let me guess.

58:22.036 --> 58:23.037
The Natural.

58:23.103 --> 58:25.139
- Yes, yes!
- Ah, is it really?

58:25.205 --> 58:26.307
Yes it is.

58:26.373 --> 58:30.110
But for very weird reasons,
I love it.

58:30.177 --> 58:32.346
I have my own weird
reasons for loving it.

58:32.413 --> 58:35.015
You know, there's a
baseball field I think

58:35.082 --> 58:36.483
really close to here.

58:36.550 --> 58:37.384
Oh cool.

58:37.451 --> 58:38.485
You remember in The Natural

58:38.552 --> 58:39.119
when he goes up
to the home plate?

58:39.186 --> 58:40.254
Yeah.

58:40.321 --> 58:42.489
He's still bleeding
from an injury

58:42.556 --> 58:44.325
30 years ago?

58:45.426 --> 58:46.360
Oh!

58:46.427 --> 58:47.561
Whoah!

58:47.628 --> 58:48.562
Just run!

58:48.629 --> 58:49.496
I know.

58:50.631 --> 58:52.299
I know that guy.

58:52.366 --> 58:53.233
I know that guy.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.301
You know that base?

58:54.368 --> 58:57.905
I know the base guy.

58:57.971 --> 59:00.040
Yes!

59:00.107 --> 59:01.141
Now, go ahead.

59:02.276 --> 59:03.177
Go.

59:04.545 --> 59:05.446
Safe.

59:07.214 --> 59:08.415
Okay, one more game.

59:08.482 --> 59:12.453
I have this fantasy
that it will be great

59:12.519 --> 59:14.488
if you would help me.

59:15.756 --> 59:16.990
Okay?

59:17.057 --> 59:18.258
Make it real.

59:19.526 --> 59:20.260
Okay.

59:20.327 --> 59:22.629
So it's after a game,

59:22.696 --> 59:25.265
you've just like won a game.

59:26.133 --> 59:28.335
Yeah, but everybody's gone.

59:30.137 --> 59:32.005
That happened fast, okay.

59:32.072 --> 59:34.541
It's just you on the field

59:34.608 --> 59:37.611
and like you, you are
the star of the game,

59:37.678 --> 59:39.146
and I'm like,

59:39.213 --> 59:42.015
I'm a girl you like

59:42.082 --> 59:45.352
and I come into the field

59:45.419 --> 59:47.388
and I like lean up
against the fence

59:47.454 --> 59:51.558
and then you like do
this, one of these things.

59:53.026 --> 59:54.228
Okay.

59:54.294 --> 59:57.631
And then you, uh,

59:57.698 --> 59:59.566
Like one of these things?

59:59.633 --> 1:00:00.434
What is this thing?

1:00:00.501 --> 1:00:01.702
I put my hand on the fence?

1:00:01.769 --> 1:00:02.636
Yeah.

1:00:02.703 --> 1:00:03.504
Like this?

1:00:03.570 --> 1:00:04.104
Mhmm.

1:00:04.171 --> 1:00:04.638
This is right?

1:00:04.705 --> 1:00:06.006
Yeah.

1:00:06.073 --> 1:00:10.644
And then I mean, the story
goes on in my head and,

1:00:12.346 --> 1:00:15.716
yeah, I mean, more stuff,
more stuff happens.

1:00:15.783 --> 1:00:17.985
Like what do you mean?

1:00:18.051 --> 1:00:18.919
What do you mean?

1:00:18.986 --> 1:00:20.721
You know, more stuff happens.

1:00:20.788 --> 1:00:21.622
You know.

1:00:21.688 --> 1:00:22.523
We talk?

1:00:22.589 --> 1:00:23.624
We talk.

1:00:23.690 --> 1:00:26.360
We talk and then other things,
and,

1:00:27.261 --> 1:00:28.061
but this is where it starts.

1:00:28.128 --> 1:00:29.296
And the lighting's so beautiful,

1:00:29.363 --> 1:00:31.098
I just thought we should.

1:00:31.165 --> 1:00:32.466
Is that happening now?

1:00:33.333 --> 1:00:34.701
I mean what, sorry.

1:00:36.136 --> 1:00:37.204
It can.

1:00:49.116 --> 1:00:51.385
Here, you try this side.

1:00:56.690 --> 1:00:57.691
Oh, I feel powerful.

1:00:57.758 --> 1:00:59.259
Yeah.

1:00:59.326 --> 1:01:00.027
- Yeah.
- This is kind of

1:01:00.093 --> 1:01:01.295
a dominating position

1:01:01.361 --> 1:01:03.497
- don't you think?
- It is.

1:01:05.098 --> 1:01:06.500
Only I don't mind it.

1:01:08.569 --> 1:01:09.470
Well.

1:01:55.682 --> 1:01:56.583
Mel?

1:01:57.618 --> 1:01:58.685
Hey.

1:01:58.752 --> 1:02:00.855
I hope it's okay,
I raided your pantry.

1:02:00.922 --> 1:02:02.189
I made biscuits.

1:02:02.256 --> 1:02:03.657
Oh my god, wait.

1:02:03.724 --> 1:02:07.594
Well you made that
here, just this morning?

1:02:07.661 --> 1:02:08.863
Mhmm.

1:02:08.930 --> 1:02:11.665
I felt inspired and energized.

1:02:15.168 --> 1:02:16.136
Goodness.

1:02:16.203 --> 1:02:17.137
Yeah.

1:02:19.673 --> 1:02:20.340
Mmm.

1:02:20.407 --> 1:02:21.843
Well you look nice.

1:02:21.910 --> 1:02:22.844
Good morning.

1:02:22.911 --> 1:02:23.811
Morning.

1:02:25.847 --> 1:02:26.580
Is this one mine?

1:02:26.647 --> 1:02:28.883
Yeah, if you want it.

1:02:28.950 --> 1:02:30.117
Let's see.

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:33.687
Oh my gosh.

1:02:33.754 --> 1:02:36.290
Hey, your phone's
going crazy, huh?

1:02:36.356 --> 1:02:37.424
Oh.

1:02:39.192 --> 1:02:41.161
Shoot, I have to go.

1:02:41.228 --> 1:02:42.529
What, why, no.

1:02:42.596 --> 1:02:45.232
Just started, I took one bite.

1:02:45.299 --> 1:02:46.166
I know.

1:02:47.401 --> 1:02:48.602
Okay.

1:02:48.669 --> 1:02:52.439
I am competing in the
arm wrestling tournament.

1:02:52.506 --> 1:02:54.174
I'm Freaked Out.

1:02:54.241 --> 1:02:55.542
Yeah, I know.

1:02:56.543 --> 1:02:58.245
I wear a mask, how would-

1:02:58.312 --> 1:02:58.980
- Oh come on.

1:02:59.047 --> 1:03:01.481
It is a small mask.

1:03:01.548 --> 1:03:03.885
I mean it barely
covers your face

1:03:03.952 --> 1:03:05.552
and I know this face.

1:03:07.487 --> 1:03:09.256
I like this face, so.

1:03:09.323 --> 1:03:10.557
Why didn't you say anything?

1:03:11.792 --> 1:03:15.195
I was just waiting for
you to tell me, you know?

1:03:15.262 --> 1:03:16.064
I have to go,

1:03:16.129 --> 1:03:16.831
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.

1:03:16.898 --> 1:03:17.564
Please.

1:03:17.631 --> 1:03:18.665
You know I think,

1:03:18.732 --> 1:03:20.267
I think I might change
my persona.

1:03:21.535 --> 1:03:24.504
I don't know that Freaked
Out is right anymore.

1:03:26.740 --> 1:03:27.474
Oh!

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:28.275
I made you breakfast.

1:03:28.342 --> 1:03:32.312
Thank you.

1:03:33.246 --> 1:03:34.916
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:03:34.983 --> 1:03:37.217
Freaked Out has died.

1:03:37.284 --> 1:03:40.520
In her place, The Breadwinner!

1:03:49.730 --> 1:03:50.397
Boom!

1:03:50.464 --> 1:03:51.365
Winner!

1:03:52.499 --> 1:03:55.435
We're back to pure excitement!

1:03:55.502 --> 1:03:56.236
Oh!

1:03:56.303 --> 1:03:57.504
The winner!

1:03:57.571 --> 1:04:01.241
It's Wendy
versus the Breadwinner.

1:04:03.811 --> 1:04:05.013
Yeah!

1:04:05.079 --> 1:04:09.282
Go back to the deep
blue sea, Killer Kate!

1:04:09.349 --> 1:04:10.484
Come on, Mel!

1:04:10.550 --> 1:04:11.853
Jerry, oh fuck!

1:04:12.887 --> 1:04:16.556
We got Rambea
versus the Bonecrusher.

1:04:18.592 --> 1:04:20.560
Winner!

1:04:20.627 --> 1:04:21.896
Go on, Joan!

1:04:22.830 --> 1:04:25.867
Bonecrusher wins again!

1:04:25.933 --> 1:04:29.236
I've never seen
arm wrestling like this!

1:04:29.302 --> 1:04:30.138
I want you to make a face

1:04:30.203 --> 1:04:31.738
that will fucking terrify me.

1:04:31.806 --> 1:04:34.241
Oh yeah!

1:04:34.307 --> 1:04:39.613
Bread, bread,
bread, bread, bread, bread!

1:04:40.414 --> 1:04:43.417
Ah, yeah!

1:04:44.618 --> 1:04:47.955
Another victim
for Bonecrusher!

1:04:51.625 --> 1:04:53.560
The Maritime Murderer

1:04:53.627 --> 1:04:57.364
who looks like a ghost
who died on a cruise.

1:05:00.634 --> 1:05:03.871
Bread, bread,
bread, bread!

1:05:08.642 --> 1:05:10.410
We're never gonna die now!

1:05:10.477 --> 1:05:11.378
Go!

1:05:12.546 --> 1:05:13.480
Oh, winner!

1:05:14.614 --> 1:05:16.516
Breadwinner wins again!

1:05:16.583 --> 1:05:18.685
She advances to the semifinals

1:05:18.752 --> 1:05:20.888
against Tessie the Tank.

1:05:22.389 --> 1:05:23.623
For some unknown reason,

1:05:23.690 --> 1:05:24.859
that little bread bitch
is beating everybody.

1:05:24.926 --> 1:05:28.662
And now she's got Greg
in her back pocket.

1:05:28.729 --> 1:05:30.731
Don't worry, I've been
training like a fiend

1:05:30.797 --> 1:05:32.365
for our match.

1:05:32.432 --> 1:05:33.868
I won't disappoint you.

1:05:33.935 --> 1:05:34.836
Good.

1:05:34.902 --> 1:05:37.304
'Cause I want you
to take her out.

1:05:37.370 --> 1:05:38.538
Yeah.

1:05:38.605 --> 1:05:39.406
Yeah.

1:05:39.473 --> 1:05:41.341
Get the ref to pull the strap.

1:05:41.408 --> 1:05:42.776
What?

1:05:42.844 --> 1:05:44.644
Remember what I taught you?

1:05:44.711 --> 1:05:46.713
What to do with the buckle?

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.582
I don't need to do that.

1:05:48.648 --> 1:05:49.783
I can beat her fair and square.

1:05:49.851 --> 1:05:51.384
Just do it!

1:05:52.652 --> 1:05:54.454
Or I'll dump you
at that pathetic

1:05:54.521 --> 1:05:55.689
Dairy Queen drive through window

1:05:55.756 --> 1:05:57.091
where I found you.

1:05:59.127 --> 1:06:00.027
Okay.

1:06:08.635 --> 1:06:10.805
Set the wrist, ladies.

1:06:11.806 --> 1:06:13.707
Hey, set your wrists!

1:06:13.774 --> 1:06:14.775
She won't set.

1:06:14.842 --> 1:06:16.944
I'm not doing it,
you're doing it.

1:06:19.981 --> 1:06:21.916
Come on ladies, on the table.

1:06:21.983 --> 1:06:24.886
Ladies, on your mats, let's go.

1:06:35.762 --> 1:06:36.797
Come on!

1:06:36.864 --> 1:06:40.467
- Are you kidding?
- No I'm not doing it!

1:06:40.534 --> 1:06:41.434
Oh shit!

1:06:42.937 --> 1:06:45.940
The strap is out!

1:06:46.773 --> 1:06:47.875
Fuck!

1:06:47.942 --> 1:06:49.442
It's okay, Mel.

1:06:50.644 --> 1:06:52.914
On the table, ladies,
let's go.

1:06:52.980 --> 1:06:54.982
Come on, let's do it.

1:06:57.051 --> 1:06:58.418
Tie 'em up!

1:06:58.485 --> 1:06:59.786
Tie 'em up!

1:06:59.854 --> 1:07:00.922
You got this!

1:07:00.988 --> 1:07:02.622
You got this Mel,

1:07:02.689 --> 1:07:03.757
this is nothing.

1:07:03.825 --> 1:07:06.093
Don't worry about it, Mel.

1:07:08.896 --> 1:07:09.864
She's never done a strap.

1:07:09.931 --> 1:07:12.332
I know, I know, I know.

1:07:17.470 --> 1:07:18.605
Go!

1:07:21.741 --> 1:07:22.609
Ah, ah!

1:07:24.245 --> 1:07:25.345
Ah!

1:07:29.583 --> 1:07:30.584
Fuck!

1:07:30.650 --> 1:07:33.653
The winner,
Tessie the Tank!

1:07:42.729 --> 1:07:44.065
Fucking bullshit!

1:07:44.131 --> 1:07:46.934
God, what the fuck was that?

1:07:47.001 --> 1:07:48.035
Hey, what are you
out here for?

1:07:48.102 --> 1:07:49.636
Go and see your girl.

1:07:49.703 --> 1:07:51.671
Come on, you stupid bitch!

1:07:51.738 --> 1:07:54.041
I'll kick your fucking ass!

1:08:01.781 --> 1:08:02.850
Did you hear?

1:08:02.917 --> 1:08:04.584
I'm in the finals tonight.

1:08:04.651 --> 1:08:05.485
Oh yeah.

1:08:05.552 --> 1:08:06.753
Congratulations, that's great.

1:08:06.821 --> 1:08:09.456
How about some drinks
tonight after I win?

1:08:09.522 --> 1:08:13.027
Oh, I'm actually dating
somebody right now, so.

1:08:13.094 --> 1:08:14.628
Don't tell me
it's that bread bitch.

1:08:14.694 --> 1:08:15.695
Breadwinner.

1:08:15.762 --> 1:08:16.964
And I wouldn't use
the word bitch

1:08:17.031 --> 1:08:19.967
just 'cause I don't wanna
use that word anymore.

1:08:20.034 --> 1:08:22.136
I feel like it's
kind of overused.

1:08:25.940 --> 1:08:27.074
What are you doing?

1:08:32.847 --> 1:08:33.747
Mel!

1:08:36.583 --> 1:08:38.752
Mel, Mel, hey!

1:08:38.819 --> 1:08:39.552
What?

1:08:39.619 --> 1:08:40.453
I'm sorry about that.

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:41.856
That whole thing with Brenda,

1:08:41.923 --> 1:08:43.090
it's a misunderstanding.

1:08:43.157 --> 1:08:45.226
No, you don't owe me
an explanation for that.

1:08:45.293 --> 1:08:47.661
Wait, what happened
to your hand?

1:08:47.727 --> 1:08:48.595
Are you okay?

1:08:48.662 --> 1:08:49.830
Yeah.

1:08:49.897 --> 1:08:50.730
Well, no.

1:08:50.797 --> 1:08:53.000
I'm really confused, you know?

1:08:53.067 --> 1:08:53.868
Okay.

1:08:53.935 --> 1:08:56.803
This all feels like a mistake.

1:08:56.871 --> 1:08:58.806
I have to,
I gotta get out of here.

1:08:58.873 --> 1:09:00.207
Wait, Mel.

1:09:10.851 --> 1:09:12.053
Mmm!

1:09:12.119 --> 1:09:14.554
Mel, I got us some beers

1:09:14.621 --> 1:09:17.224
'cause it is time to celebrate.

1:09:17.992 --> 1:09:19.060
What are you so happy about?

1:09:19.126 --> 1:09:21.661
I got some
good news, Mel.

1:09:21.728 --> 1:09:22.696
What?

1:09:22.762 --> 1:09:24.231
Carl saw what
Tessie did to you

1:09:24.298 --> 1:09:25.565
so he disqualified her.

1:09:25.632 --> 1:09:29.070
You're going up against
Brenda the Bonecrusher.

1:09:29.136 --> 1:09:31.638
It's time to take down
that twat!

1:09:31.705 --> 1:09:34.741
Stop saying twat, Danny,
we're going.

1:09:34.809 --> 1:09:35.943
No we aren't.

1:09:36.010 --> 1:09:37.610
Yeah we are.

1:09:37.677 --> 1:09:38.980
Uh-uh.

1:09:39.046 --> 1:09:40.047
Fine, if you won't drive me,

1:09:40.114 --> 1:09:40.982
I'll just take a train.

1:09:41.048 --> 1:09:42.116
What?

1:09:42.183 --> 1:09:43.985
A train, no, Mel, come on.

1:09:44.051 --> 1:09:46.753
You just have one
more bout, dude.

1:09:48.155 --> 1:09:50.091
I'll take a train,
I'm gonna go home,

1:09:50.157 --> 1:09:51.558
I'ma get out of here,

1:09:51.624 --> 1:09:53.094
I'm not arm wrestling anymore,

1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:54.362
I'm about to lose my bakery,

1:09:54.428 --> 1:09:56.931
I'm getting involved with
a guy that I barely know.

1:09:56.998 --> 1:09:58.665
Oh, hell yeah.

1:09:58.732 --> 1:10:01.268
And you guys are a hot couple.

1:10:01.335 --> 1:10:03.237
Have you seen
that movie Unfaithful

1:10:03.304 --> 1:10:06.240
where they have like
that insane sex scene?

1:10:06.307 --> 1:10:07.341
I've been kind of

1:10:07.408 --> 1:10:08.209
- imagining that,
- Danny?

1:10:08.275 --> 1:10:09.410
But with your guy's face-

1:10:09.477 --> 1:10:11.846
- Why can't you ever
take anything seriously?

1:10:11.912 --> 1:10:14.048
Hey, I'm just trying
to lighten the mood!

1:10:14.115 --> 1:10:15.149
Danny.

1:10:15.216 --> 1:10:17.952
I got hurt, I ripped
my hand open.

1:10:18.919 --> 1:10:20.254
Like this is,

1:10:20.321 --> 1:10:21.989
there are real things happening.

1:10:22.056 --> 1:10:23.556
It's not all...

1:10:24.859 --> 1:10:28.628
Fun and games, like this
whole thing is a disaster.

1:10:29.363 --> 1:10:32.066
Wait, no, we can't
let Brenda win.

1:10:32.133 --> 1:10:33.733
I don't care about Brenda.

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:36.203
I have a life outside of this.

1:10:36.270 --> 1:10:38.005
I have things going on.

1:10:38.072 --> 1:10:39.306
You might not, but I do,

1:10:39.373 --> 1:10:42.143
and you've got me focused
on all the wrong stuff.

1:10:42.209 --> 1:10:44.778
Oh, bullshit, it's
been good for you!

1:10:44.845 --> 1:10:45.880
Good for me?

1:10:45.946 --> 1:10:46.914
Yeah.

1:10:46.981 --> 1:10:48.082
Don't do that, Danny.

1:10:49.216 --> 1:10:50.784
This is not for me.

1:10:50.851 --> 1:10:51.919
This is for you.

1:10:51.986 --> 1:10:53.187
This is for you

1:10:53.254 --> 1:10:55.890
so you can get revenge
on the woman you hate.

1:10:55.956 --> 1:10:57.258
Right?

1:10:57.324 --> 1:10:58.691
Isn't it, Danny?

1:10:59.260 --> 1:11:00.428
You got me running around here

1:11:00.494 --> 1:11:03.264
like some arm wrestling
freak, getting,

1:11:03.330 --> 1:11:05.900
Is that what you think I am?

1:11:05.966 --> 1:11:06.901
A freak?

1:11:07.835 --> 1:11:09.103
Is it, Mel?

1:11:09.170 --> 1:11:11.172
Fuck, Mel!

1:11:11.238 --> 1:11:13.007
Fuck off.

1:11:13.074 --> 1:11:14.408
Go ahead, walk away.

1:11:14.475 --> 1:11:17.878
Walk away like
you always fucking do!

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:18.946
I don't walk away.

1:11:19.013 --> 1:11:20.214
Bullshit.

1:11:20.281 --> 1:11:22.349
Anytime you can't do with
anything emotionally,

1:11:22.416 --> 1:11:24.385
you just turn around
and walk away

1:11:24.452 --> 1:11:26.287
with a little tail
between your legs.

1:11:26.353 --> 1:11:27.188
No, I don't.

1:11:27.254 --> 1:11:28.055
Yes you do.

1:11:28.122 --> 1:11:28.923
No, I don't.

1:11:28.989 --> 1:11:29.789
Yes you do.

1:11:29.857 --> 1:11:30.858
It's between your legs right now

1:11:30.925 --> 1:11:31.591
- It is not.
- just sticking out

1:11:31.658 --> 1:11:33.094
like a little dick!

1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:34.328
Just like this!

1:11:34.395 --> 1:11:36.097
My tail is not a little dick.

1:11:36.163 --> 1:11:36.796
Yes it is, go!

1:11:36.864 --> 1:11:38.065
My tail is high!

1:11:38.132 --> 1:11:41.402
Pff, your tail hasn't
been high in years.

1:11:41.469 --> 1:11:42.336
It is right now,

1:11:42.403 --> 1:11:44.171
take a good look at my asshole!

1:11:44.238 --> 1:11:46.073
Let me see.

1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:47.774
It's a dick tail

1:11:47.842 --> 1:11:50.077
- poking out!
- You're a dick tail!

1:11:50.144 --> 1:11:51.879
Dick tails, woo hoo!

1:11:57.351 --> 1:11:59.820
If she's not here by
eight, she'll forfeit.

1:11:59.887 --> 1:12:01.288
Hell yes.

1:12:01.355 --> 1:12:02.356
You're cool with that?

1:12:02.423 --> 1:12:04.959
I'll be the first ever
arm wrestler

1:12:05.025 --> 1:12:06.961
to win a grand slam.

1:12:07.027 --> 1:12:09.463
It's not really winning
if you don't even compete.

1:12:09.530 --> 1:12:10.998
Shut the fuck up.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:13.100
Do my shoulders.

1:12:14.135 --> 1:12:15.035
Yes.

1:12:18.472 --> 1:12:19.706
It's hard with these things.

1:12:19.772 --> 1:12:21.275
Work around it.

1:12:21.342 --> 1:12:22.877
Yes.

1:12:35.923 --> 1:12:36.789
Hi, one.

1:12:39.326 --> 1:12:40.561
Attention
customers,

1:12:40.628 --> 1:12:43.464
straight on channel
three, there should be,

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:45.732
I'm just gonna go
wherever and figure it out.

1:12:47.268 --> 1:12:48.169
Oh Sue.

1:12:49.537 --> 1:12:50.803
Sue, you crack me up.

1:12:50.871 --> 1:12:53.740
I mean I've never been
out of the country before.

1:12:53.807 --> 1:12:55.242
I don't get why, Dotty.

1:12:55.309 --> 1:12:56.510
Friends forever, right?

1:12:56.577 --> 1:12:57.945
Friends forever, yes.

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:01.248
Hey Danny.

1:13:01.315 --> 1:13:03.150
Hey, Jerry.

1:13:03.217 --> 1:13:04.151
You okay?

1:13:04.218 --> 1:13:05.286
No.

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:10.324
Make that
bitch bleed!

1:13:12.092 --> 1:13:13.227
Yeah.

1:13:14.161 --> 1:13:15.062
Yeah!

1:13:16.830 --> 1:13:17.965
Fuck yeah!

1:13:19.099 --> 1:13:20.234
I think I can feel her
getting skinnier.

1:13:20.301 --> 1:13:21.402
Yeah!

1:13:21.468 --> 1:13:22.369
Hey!

1:13:26.874 --> 1:13:28.842
That's Melanie's costume.

1:13:28.909 --> 1:13:30.044
You got nothing else
in your life,

1:13:30.110 --> 1:13:31.011
do you, Danny?

1:13:31.879 --> 1:13:33.547
Well, you couldn't wrestle.

1:13:33.614 --> 1:13:35.382
So you dragged your
silly little friend here

1:13:35.449 --> 1:13:38.385
to wrestle for you, pathetic.

1:13:38.452 --> 1:13:43.257
Turns out, she's a loser
just like you.

1:13:44.024 --> 1:13:45.192
Oh, good one!

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:47.794
Jerry, beer me.

1:13:49.396 --> 1:13:50.531
Get her, sic her!

1:13:52.866 --> 1:13:54.335
Jerry, goddamit!

1:13:55.369 --> 1:13:56.170
Careful!

1:13:57.204 --> 1:14:00.307
Oh my god!

1:14:03.877 --> 1:14:05.446
Who's dominated now, huh?

1:14:09.283 --> 1:14:13.821
It is finally time
for our grand finale!

1:14:16.523 --> 1:14:18.325
Tonight, someone will walk away

1:14:18.392 --> 1:14:20.160
with 15,000 dollars!

1:14:23.964 --> 1:14:27.401
Who will be our champion?

1:14:29.003 --> 1:14:30.871
Sit tight,
we're just moments away

1:14:30.938 --> 1:14:34.408
from the grand championship!

1:14:38.479 --> 1:14:39.580
Danny!

1:14:39.647 --> 1:14:40.914
Oh my god!

1:14:41.615 --> 1:14:42.616
Mel?

1:14:42.683 --> 1:14:44.385
Danny,
what happened?

1:14:44.451 --> 1:14:45.552
What are you doing here?

1:14:45.619 --> 1:14:48.088
You should be on your way
back to Kansas.

1:14:48.155 --> 1:14:49.390
Jerry called me.

1:14:49.456 --> 1:14:50.958
Are you okay?

1:14:51.025 --> 1:14:51.859
Goddamit, Jerry.

1:14:51.925 --> 1:14:54.061
I got in a fight with Brenda.

1:14:55.462 --> 1:14:58.265
Danny, this crazy
vendetta against Brenda

1:14:58.332 --> 1:15:00.567
is not worth getting
hurt like this.

1:15:00.634 --> 1:15:01.669
No.

1:15:01.735 --> 1:15:04.505
Hey Danny,
take these for later.

1:15:04.571 --> 1:15:06.373
Oh, thank you.

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.075
Is she gonna be okay?

1:15:08.142 --> 1:15:10.978
She's a little beat
up but she'll be okay.

1:15:11.679 --> 1:15:12.780
Why are you still wearing that?

1:15:12.846 --> 1:15:15.349
I told you before
that you don't need it.

1:15:18.485 --> 1:15:21.088
What, I don't understand,
don't need what?

1:15:23.957 --> 1:15:27.227
Mel, I don't,
my wrist is fine.

1:15:27.961 --> 1:15:29.129
What?

1:15:29.196 --> 1:15:32.066
After your first bout,
I had Lauren check it out

1:15:32.132 --> 1:15:35.336
and it's totally healed.

1:15:36.637 --> 1:15:39.273
Then why am I doing this?

1:15:39.340 --> 1:15:42.376
Why aren't you doing
this whole tournament?

1:15:42.443 --> 1:15:44.645
To be very honest,
it started off

1:15:44.712 --> 1:15:47.581
as just I wanted revenge.

1:15:47.648 --> 1:15:49.283
And you were a part of my plan,

1:15:49.350 --> 1:15:53.954
but then I saw you
out there just ooh,

1:15:54.021 --> 1:15:57.925
like destroying people
left and right

1:15:57.991 --> 1:16:00.461
and just becoming this,

1:16:01.729 --> 1:16:05.566
this Melanie that I knew
long ago.

1:16:06.767 --> 1:16:08.369
So you did this for me?

1:16:11.138 --> 1:16:12.406
Yeah.

1:16:12.473 --> 1:16:16.076
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1:16:16.143 --> 1:16:17.211
Yeah, man.

1:16:18.412 --> 1:16:19.513
You're badass.

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:22.516
You're fucking badass, dude.

1:16:23.684 --> 1:16:24.585
I am badass.

1:16:24.651 --> 1:16:27.187
You're a badass
and you're back!

1:16:27.254 --> 1:16:27.988
- And you know what?
- What?

1:16:28.055 --> 1:16:29.189
I'ma go kick her ass!

1:16:29.256 --> 1:16:31.225
You're gonna beat
the shit out of her!

1:16:31.291 --> 1:16:32.259
- We'll get a knife.
- On the table.

1:16:32.326 --> 1:16:33.494
- No, we won't get a knife.
- What?

1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:34.495
I'm gonna do it

1:16:34.561 --> 1:16:35.429
- in a regulated,
- Of course.

1:16:35.496 --> 1:16:36.497
- Safe way.
- Of course.

1:16:36.563 --> 1:16:38.565
But I'm gonna kick
that twat's ass!

1:16:40.334 --> 1:16:41.101
Oh, she doesn't give a shit.

1:16:41.168 --> 1:16:41.735
You're back!

1:16:41.802 --> 1:16:43.170
Yeah, let's go!

1:16:43.237 --> 1:16:46.607
Tonight we find our ladies'
arm wrestling champion!

1:16:51.178 --> 1:16:52.446
In this corner,

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:55.215
there's legends in every sport.

1:16:55.282 --> 1:16:57.718
There's Air Jordan,
there's Iron Mike,

1:16:57.785 --> 1:17:01.155
and there is Brenda
the Bonecrusher!

1:17:08.262 --> 1:17:11.365
And her opponent
came out of nowhere

1:17:12.366 --> 1:17:15.302
to take the arm wrestling
world by storm.

1:17:15.369 --> 1:17:17.037
And if you can't take the heat,

1:17:17.104 --> 1:17:18.672
get out of her kitchen.

1:17:18.739 --> 1:17:21.508
It's the Breadwinner!

1:17:29.450 --> 1:17:33.120
Bread, bread,
bread, bread, bread, bread

1:17:33.187 --> 1:17:36.223
bread, bread, bread,
bread, bread!

1:17:39.092 --> 1:17:39.928
Yeah!

1:17:41.762 --> 1:17:42.831
Yeah, Mel, come on,

1:17:42.897 --> 1:17:43.697
- you got this!
- yeah, come on, Mel!

1:17:43.764 --> 1:17:45.766
This championship bout is best

1:17:45.834 --> 1:17:47.468
two out of three!

1:17:59.313 --> 1:18:00.981
Wrestlers ready.

1:18:05.854 --> 1:18:07.254
Scared yet?

1:18:08.188 --> 1:18:10.557
I was born scared.

1:18:10.624 --> 1:18:11.525
Set.

1:18:12.894 --> 1:18:14.094
Go!

1:18:20.300 --> 1:18:21.068
You can do it!

1:18:21.134 --> 1:18:23.570
Come on Mel, you got this!

1:18:28.308 --> 1:18:30.143
You did it, just one more.

1:18:30.210 --> 1:18:32.279
Just one more, you got this.

1:18:39.152 --> 1:18:41.321
You can do it, Brenda.

1:18:50.731 --> 1:18:51.798
Scared yet?

1:18:53.166 --> 1:18:54.101
Fuck off.

1:18:55.937 --> 1:18:57.504
Set.

1:18:58.305 --> 1:18:59.139
Go!

1:18:59.206 --> 1:19:00.040
- Here we go now!
- Yeah!

1:19:00.107 --> 1:19:02.442
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:19:02.509 --> 1:19:04.812
Come on Brenda!

1:19:04.879 --> 1:19:06.346
Keep your form.

1:19:06.413 --> 1:19:08.549
Mel, your break arm position!

1:19:08.615 --> 1:19:09.616
No!

1:19:10.350 --> 1:19:11.251
Ow!

1:19:11.318 --> 1:19:12.185
Yeah!

1:19:24.866 --> 1:19:26.199
You're doing great.

1:19:26.266 --> 1:19:27.801
I'll be right back.

1:19:33.473 --> 1:19:35.843
- Don't get, ugh.
- Oh fuck!

1:19:38.478 --> 1:19:39.146
Oh, Jesus Christ,

1:19:39.212 --> 1:19:40.414
I've never seen anything

1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:42.850
- look like that before.
- What does it look like?

1:19:42.917 --> 1:19:43.851
Is it bad?

1:19:43.918 --> 1:19:45.285
Yeah, it's bad,
don't look at it.

1:19:45.352 --> 1:19:46.186
I have to look.

1:19:46.253 --> 1:19:47.021
- What?
- I have to look.

1:19:47.087 --> 1:19:48.155
Please don't look at it.

1:19:48.221 --> 1:19:50.324
No you don't,
don't look at it, please.

1:19:50.390 --> 1:19:51.425
Please don't look-

1:19:53.962 --> 1:19:55.329
Why did you look at it?!

1:19:55.395 --> 1:19:56.463
Ew!

1:19:57.230 --> 1:19:59.366
Ew, Mel, oh my god!

1:19:59.433 --> 1:20:00.001
Mel!

1:20:01.401 --> 1:20:03.770
I wanna give you a hug
but I'm scared it's gonna,

1:20:03.838 --> 1:20:05.572
oh fuck, that up!

1:20:05.639 --> 1:20:09.209
Mel, I'm so sorry
I did this to you.

1:20:09.276 --> 1:20:10.444
I fucked up!

1:20:10.510 --> 1:20:13.447
This is all my fucking
fault, I'm so sorry.

1:20:13.513 --> 1:20:15.716
Danny, no, no, no.

1:20:16.918 --> 1:20:18.619
It's not your fault.

1:20:18.685 --> 1:20:20.420
For the first time in my life

1:20:20.487 --> 1:20:23.323
I feel like I'm in my life,
you know,

1:20:23.390 --> 1:20:26.593
like I feel like I'm living,

1:20:26.660 --> 1:20:30.932
like I'm making choices
and I'm breaking things.

1:20:30.999 --> 1:20:32.299
Ah, ah!

1:20:34.035 --> 1:20:35.135
Oh my god.

1:20:37.437 --> 1:20:40.307
I'm so grateful to you.

1:20:40.374 --> 1:20:41.909
I'm so thankful.

1:20:41.976 --> 1:20:42.844
What?

1:20:42.910 --> 1:20:44.946
I know this seems really bad.

1:20:45.013 --> 1:20:48.749
But it's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1:20:48.816 --> 1:20:51.685
And I wouldn't have done
it if it weren't for you.

1:20:51.752 --> 1:20:55.489
And I'm just so, so, so thankful

1:20:55.555 --> 1:20:57.290
that you pushed me to do this.

1:20:58.425 --> 1:20:59.726
Oh, I didn't wanna
disappoint you

1:20:59.793 --> 1:21:01.795
and I'm sorry that I didn't win.

1:21:01.863 --> 1:21:04.331
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:21:04.398 --> 1:21:06.433
You didn't disappoint me.

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.635
Did you see what
you did out there?

1:21:08.702 --> 1:21:10.804
You fucking destroyed it.

1:21:10.872 --> 1:21:14.708
I've never seen anything
like that before!

1:21:14.775 --> 1:21:17.244
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1:21:17.310 --> 1:21:18.478
Thank you, Danny.

1:21:18.545 --> 1:21:23.885
And this, none of this
is worth it, you know?

1:21:25.452 --> 1:21:27.989
This is worth, ugh.

1:21:28.056 --> 1:21:30.357
I fucking looked.

1:21:30.424 --> 1:21:33.460
None of this is worth it, okay?

1:21:33.527 --> 1:21:34.896
It's okay to walk away.

1:21:37.798 --> 1:21:40.634
I'm gonna go tell them
that you're out, okay?

1:21:40.701 --> 1:21:42.335
Then we'll get you fixed up.

1:22:16.703 --> 1:22:19.006
Hey man, she's out.

1:22:19.773 --> 1:22:22.076
Her arm is really messed up.

1:22:22.143 --> 1:22:24.879
I have to give it
to Bonecrusher.

1:22:24.946 --> 1:22:25.847
Yeah.

1:22:26.747 --> 1:22:27.982
Fuck.

1:22:43.697 --> 1:22:48.769
Whoah, oh my god!

1:22:57.912 --> 1:22:59.746
Mel, are you sure
you wanna do this?

1:22:59.814 --> 1:23:02.382
I'm not gonna walk
away anymore.

1:23:04.819 --> 1:23:06.653
Okay, you can't grip the pin,

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:09.023
so use your foot as an anchor.

1:23:10.024 --> 1:23:12.026
She's back,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:23:12.093 --> 1:23:14.829
Not even a broken arm
can stop her.

1:23:24.738 --> 1:23:25.907
Oh my god.

1:23:26.974 --> 1:23:30.044
So who the hell are you now?

1:23:30.111 --> 1:23:31.012
Go!

1:23:40.822 --> 1:23:43.590
I am Golden Arm.

1:23:44.192 --> 1:23:45.559
Golden Arm!

1:23:45.625 --> 1:23:46.861
Golden Arm, woohoo!

1:23:46.928 --> 1:23:50.664
Golden Arm,
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,

1:23:50.730 --> 1:23:53.667
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,
Golden Arm,

1:23:55.002 --> 1:23:55.970
Golden Arm, Golden Arm!

1:24:14.889 --> 1:24:16.723
My god, you did it!

1:24:16.790 --> 1:24:19.994
Holy shit, Jerry,
she fucking did it!

1:24:21.728 --> 1:24:23.430
She fucking did it!

1:24:58.199 --> 1:25:01.168
Golden Arm,
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,

1:25:01.235 --> 1:25:04.504
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,
Golden Arm,

1:25:05.538 --> 1:25:08.675
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,
Golden Arm,

1:25:09.977 --> 1:25:13.080
Golden Arm, Golden Arm,
Golden Arm!

1:25:23.723 --> 1:25:26.093
Ready, set, go!

1:25:57.325 --> 1:25:58.591
Call my dad!

1:25:59.994 --> 1:26:00.928
Is someone?

1:26:02.997 --> 1:26:03.931
Danny.

1:26:05.333 --> 1:26:07.467
My choker's too tight.

1:26:08.069 --> 1:26:09.971
Yeah, Bonecrusher!

1:26:10.037 --> 1:26:12.672
I don't think
there's a camera there.

1:26:12.739 --> 1:26:14.241
Mouthy ones.

1:26:14.308 --> 1:26:16.643
Ooh, some of them were talkers.

1:26:18.012 --> 1:26:18.913
Hey!

1:26:23.616 --> 1:26:24.318
Ooh!

1:26:24.385 --> 1:26:24.885
I'll fuck you in a car!

1:26:24.952 --> 1:26:25.618
Haha yeah!

1:26:26.954 --> 1:26:29.156
I don't even know if I'm
supposed to be back here.

1:26:29.223 --> 1:26:30.757
Probably not.

1:26:32.927 --> 1:26:34.128
I'm already here though.

1:26:34.195 --> 1:26:36.097
My aunt can do this
and she's got a hook.

1:26:36.163 --> 1:26:37.231
Come on.

1:26:38.399 --> 1:26:40.968
What the fuck
is in this?!

1:26:41.035 --> 1:26:41.969
Tobacco spit.

1:26:45.373 --> 1:26:46.207
I'm gonna throw up.

1:26:46.273 --> 1:26:47.507
Oh yeah.

1:26:49.877 --> 1:26:51.245
Mel is Golden Arm.

1:26:51.312 --> 1:26:53.247
I mean, it's amazing.

1:26:53.314 --> 1:26:55.149
Some guys
they like little waves.

1:26:55.216 --> 1:26:58.152
Some guys, they like
women they can carry.

1:26:58.219 --> 1:27:00.287
No, carry me, carry me.

1:27:00.354 --> 1:27:02.056
I wanna be the little spoon.

1:27:03.690 --> 1:27:05.059
That's what I'm talking about.

1:27:05.126 --> 1:27:07.727
I really like Jerry.

1:27:07.794 --> 1:27:09.796
He's so sweaty.

1:27:11.298 --> 1:27:13.367
I bet he'd be really slippery.

1:27:13.434 --> 1:27:15.735
I got just a little
frisbee, you know

1:27:15.802 --> 1:27:18.005
in case you wanna
have fun with that.

1:27:18.072 --> 1:27:19.840
And a light if it gets dark.

1:27:20.808 --> 1:27:23.610
I got tongs,
always need good tongs.

1:27:23.676 --> 1:27:25.012
When I first met Danny,

1:27:25.079 --> 1:27:26.746
I saw myself in her.

1:27:28.082 --> 1:27:29.783
She felt like a young Randy.

1:27:30.351 --> 1:27:34.188
But I was never that stupid.

1:27:34.255 --> 1:27:36.257
Maybe she's jealous, you know.

1:27:36.323 --> 1:27:39.293
I hate that,
I hate the thought of that

1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:42.196
but she is weird
about her scones, right,

1:27:42.263 --> 1:27:42.930
am I right?

1:27:42.997 --> 1:27:45.366
I mean, she's weird.

1:27:45.433 --> 1:27:47.767
Watch this guys, watch this.

1:27:47.835 --> 1:27:48.735
Wait.

1:27:49.636 --> 1:27:52.807
Pretty cool, huh?

1:27:52.873 --> 1:27:54.875
I can do it with almost
any pair of glasses.

1:27:54.942 --> 1:27:59.180
Star Arena, turns out is
built on an ancient ocean.

1:27:59.246 --> 1:28:00.580
So that's where I come from.

1:28:02.016 --> 1:28:05.785
Just sort of emerged out of
some kelp, seaweed, coral,

1:28:05.853 --> 1:28:10.391
and now this is a women's
arm wrestling arena

1:28:10.458 --> 1:28:13.060
and turns out
I fit in pretty good.

1:28:13.127 --> 1:28:16.063
So you know what I say to
all you ladies out there?

1:28:16.130 --> 1:28:17.231
Don't be afraid!

1:28:17.298 --> 1:28:21.936
Crush, crush, crush the world!

1:28:24.371 --> 1:28:25.738
Labes out!

1:30:27.161 --> 1:30:29.530
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:30:29.597 --> 1:30:32.299
And that was
the legend of the Golden Arm.

1:30:32.366 --> 1:30:35.402
So, movie's over.

1:30:35.469 --> 1:30:36.937
You can all go now.

1:30:37.004 --> 1:30:39.006
Just go on, get out of here.

1:30:39.073 --> 1:30:41.475
And pick up after
yourself on the way out.

1:30:41.542 --> 1:30:45.145
Have a little consideration
for the people that work here.

1:30:45.212 --> 1:30:46.247
Thank you very much.

1:30:49.516 --> 1:30:50.985
That's it, go.
