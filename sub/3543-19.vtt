00:00.915 --> 00:01.964
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:01.967 --> 00:03.466
He's dead.

00:03.468 --> 00:07.058
No, no! I can't.
I can't. I can't.

00:07.066 --> 00:08.683
I can help you turn it off.

00:08.685 --> 00:10.768
She's ruthless
without her humanity.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.320
The cure is the fastest
way to get it back.

00:12.322 --> 00:14.655
When Silas was buried
by the witch Qetsiyah,

00:14.657 --> 00:16.107
she left him with the cure.

00:16.109 --> 00:17.525
She knew that he wanted to die,

00:17.527 --> 00:19.860
be reunited with
his one true love.

00:19.862 --> 00:21.912
Free her from darkness!

00:21.914 --> 00:23.781
Aaah!

00:23.783 --> 00:24.815
Aaah!

00:24.817 --> 00:26.000
No!

00:26.002 --> 00:27.535
The triangle is complete.

00:27.537 --> 00:28.869
The witches almost killed you.

00:28.871 --> 00:30.671
What witches?

00:30.673 --> 00:32.590
How did I get off the island?

00:32.592 --> 00:34.425
What's the last thing
you can remember?

00:34.427 --> 00:38.829
Jeremy was trying to pry the
cure out of Silas' hands.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.332
Bonnie, there's something you
need to know about Jeremy.

01:02.455 --> 01:04.521
Hey, Jeremy.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.415
You know, I was...

01:17.052 --> 01:21.055
I was thinking about the
last thing I said to you.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.592
"We did it."

01:28.313 --> 01:31.715
Totally lame last thing
to say to someone.

01:33.735 --> 01:36.520
That wasn't a good-bye,
Jeremy. You...

01:38.323 --> 01:41.225
you were supposed to
come back with us.

01:43.111 --> 01:44.895
Bonnie.

01:47.783 --> 01:49.867
Jeremy.

01:49.869 --> 01:51.669
Wake up.

01:51.671 --> 01:53.070
How are you here?

01:53.072 --> 01:54.371
Bonnie, wake up.

01:54.373 --> 01:55.623
I don't understand.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.124
Open your eyes.

01:57.126 --> 01:59.009
Bonnie, open your eyes!

02:02.798 --> 02:04.581
Oh, my God.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.930
So what has it been, 8, 9 days?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.148
About 8 or 9 days.

02:21.150 --> 02:23.234
I don't know.
I lost count.

02:23.236 --> 02:25.152
We lost count of
the consecutive days

02:25.154 --> 02:27.371
in which Elena Gilbert
has not killed anyone.

02:27.373 --> 02:29.373
I'd say that's
progress, brother.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.958
So, what are we gonna do,

02:30.960 --> 02:32.827
just throw the football around

02:32.829 --> 02:34.295
for another 150 years

02:34.297 --> 02:35.746
till Elena gets
her humanity back?

02:35.748 --> 02:37.248
Because I'm cool with that.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.383
She doesn't want the cure.

02:39.385 --> 02:41.135
She's gonna start
killing people

02:41.137 --> 02:42.953
if she knows we're still
trying to get it for her.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.171
All right.

02:44.173 --> 02:46.674
We could always, uh,
make her want it.

02:46.676 --> 02:49.260
Yeah. How are you gonna
make an emotionless vampire

02:49.262 --> 02:51.178
want anything?

02:52.314 --> 02:54.148
Get her to flip
her humanity switch.

02:54.150 --> 02:56.400
So, what are we gonna do?

02:56.402 --> 02:58.402
Pull a Lexi, bombard
her with emotions

02:58.404 --> 02:59.820
till one of them sticks?

02:59.822 --> 03:00.971
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,

03:00.973 --> 03:02.156
then we go to plan "B"...

03:02.158 --> 03:03.858
lock her up
and keep her sidelined

03:03.860 --> 03:06.360
until you and I
figure out a plan "C."

03:06.362 --> 03:08.362
And what happens when
she gets slammed

03:08.364 --> 03:10.865
with every emotion she's
repressed since Jeremy died?

03:10.867 --> 03:14.418
Well, then you, my friend,

03:14.420 --> 03:16.287
will be right by her side

03:16.289 --> 03:17.988
ready to help her through it.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.542
Right, because you don't want
to keep reliving history.

03:21.544 --> 03:23.544
And when this is all over,

03:23.546 --> 03:25.880
you're just gonna
get out of her life.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.934
Bingo.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.438
All right. How do you
want to do this?

03:36.641 --> 03:39.360
Elijah, being human
means a fresh start.

03:39.362 --> 03:40.861
I can grow old
and have a family

03:40.863 --> 03:42.313
and fill my days with meaning,

03:42.315 --> 03:44.865
knowing that each one matters.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.450
Well,
that was poetic.

03:46.452 --> 03:48.369
Well, if you can provide us

03:48.371 --> 03:49.870
with a more compelling reason

03:49.872 --> 03:51.739
for wanting the
cure, Klaus, please.

03:53.291 --> 03:56.043
Silas can appear as anyone.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.628
He got inside my thoughts,

03:57.630 --> 03:59.663
convinced me I was dying.

03:59.665 --> 04:01.999
He will torment me
until I give him the cure.

04:02.001 --> 04:03.551
And in doing so,
he will break down

04:03.553 --> 04:05.052
the wall to the other side.

04:05.054 --> 04:07.254
So it doesn't trap him
there when he dies.

04:07.256 --> 04:08.923
He wants to reunite
with his lost soul mate.

04:08.925 --> 04:11.926
You, of all lovesick fools,
should applaud his devotion.

04:11.928 --> 04:13.861
He will
open the floodgates

04:13.863 --> 04:15.846
for every supernatural
being that has ever died.

04:15.848 --> 04:18.815
Including our dear
brothers Kol and Finn.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.216
We'll have our family back.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.935
Please! You hated Kol.

04:21.938 --> 04:23.887
And you kept Finn in a box
for most of his life.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.824
Elijah, please.

04:26.826 --> 04:31.561
Your personal discomfort might
not be sufficient reason

04:31.563 --> 04:35.049
for putting the entire
world in jeopardy, Klaus.

04:36.668 --> 04:39.536
I think our sister deserves
a shot at happiness.

04:40.956 --> 04:43.173
Tell me you're joking.

04:43.175 --> 04:45.809
Tell me you're not fating me
to an eternity of torture.

04:45.811 --> 04:48.128
I've made my decision.

04:51.266 --> 04:54.852
When you're sick and dying

04:54.854 --> 04:57.471
and you beg for my blood,

04:57.473 --> 04:59.390
I will laugh in your face

04:59.392 --> 05:02.026
and compel you to forget me.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.484
Where's the cure?

05:10.486 --> 05:12.453
Rebekah, it's no secret

05:12.455 --> 05:14.955
that you are impulsive,
emotional,

05:14.957 --> 05:17.758
and at times
morally questionable.

05:19.494 --> 05:20.961
Prove to me

05:20.963 --> 05:22.563
this isn't just another
one of your whims,

05:22.565 --> 05:24.331
that you know precisely

05:24.333 --> 05:25.833
what you are giving up here.

05:25.835 --> 05:29.336
Fine. Anything.

05:29.338 --> 05:32.106
I want you to live
a day as a human.

05:32.108 --> 05:34.892
This day.

05:34.894 --> 05:37.311
No vampire privileges...
no strength,

05:37.313 --> 05:39.013
no compulsion, no nothing.

05:39.015 --> 05:43.517
If you succeed and still believe
this is what you want...

05:45.186 --> 05:47.571
The cure is yours.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.861
You're gonna fail.

05:53.863 --> 05:55.645
You should be locking
yourself inside all day,

05:55.647 --> 05:57.064
not shopping for prom.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.034
Name me a more human
experience than senior prom.

06:00.036 --> 06:01.418
Death.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.920
Why should I listen to you?

06:02.922 --> 06:04.922
You don't even
have your humanity.

06:04.924 --> 06:06.690
You realize you won't even be able
to compel yourself a date, right?

06:06.692 --> 06:08.342
Yes, and last time I checked,
you're living in my house

06:08.344 --> 06:10.794
because I'm the only one
that can tolerate you,

06:10.796 --> 06:12.596
so you don't have
to be so rude.

06:12.598 --> 06:14.181
Then I'm going to
come with you.

06:14.183 --> 06:16.666
Yeah. I'll keep
an eye on you

06:16.668 --> 06:18.719
and make sure that you
pass Elijah's test.

06:18.721 --> 06:22.189
As soon as you down the cure,
it'll be gone for good.

06:22.191 --> 06:24.641
And no one will be able
to use it on me.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.147
What kind of dreams?

06:30.149 --> 06:31.982
Usually I'm at his grave,

06:31.984 --> 06:33.150
and...

06:33.152 --> 06:36.737
All of a sudden,
he appears to me.

06:36.739 --> 06:39.540
Well, you never got
to say good-bye, Bon.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.709
You're grieving.
That's normal.

06:41.711 --> 06:44.495
When I woke up,
the couch was on fire.

06:44.497 --> 06:46.397
Oh.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.332
I don't know if it's because
I was emotional in my dream

06:48.334 --> 06:50.384
or if Shane was right.

06:50.386 --> 06:52.920
Without his help, I'll
lose control of my magic.

06:52.922 --> 06:56.890
No. It's because you need a
night off from mourning.

06:56.892 --> 06:59.560
And I'm gonna make
sure that you have it.

06:59.562 --> 07:02.712
Um, you look super hot,
by the way.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.431
Do you think?

07:04.433 --> 07:06.316
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

07:06.318 --> 07:08.718
Yeah. Matt and I are gonna
have the sexiest date there.

07:10.656 --> 07:12.773
You know what?
I love friend prom.

07:12.775 --> 07:14.775
And it's exactly
what prom should be...

07:14.777 --> 07:16.326
friends and memories.

07:16.328 --> 07:19.729
Yes, it sucks that my
boyfriend can't be here,

07:19.731 --> 07:23.167
but the three of us are gonna
have the night of our lives.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.538
Hey, Bonnie. Heard
you got your mind wiped.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.506
That sucks.
Pretty dress, Caroline.

07:29.508 --> 07:32.209
I know. You helped me
pick it out months ago

07:32.211 --> 07:33.460
when we were friends,

07:33.462 --> 07:35.129
before you tried to kill me.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.964
I thought it looked familiar.

07:36.966 --> 07:38.766
Can you
press this for me?

07:38.768 --> 07:40.750
I'll pick it up later.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.352
Bonnie.

08:04.626 --> 08:06.109
I don't need a babysitter.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.294
Really?

08:07.296 --> 08:10.214
Because the last time
I saw you,

08:10.216 --> 08:13.317
you snapped a waitress' spine.

08:13.319 --> 08:16.003
It got you to stop your search
for the cure, didn't it?

08:16.005 --> 08:17.554
Yup. We're just
here to make sure

08:17.556 --> 08:19.306
you hold up your
end of the deal.

08:19.308 --> 08:22.125
Don't eat the prom queen.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.927
May I?

08:23.929 --> 08:25.295
No.

08:29.017 --> 08:31.935
Wow. Would you
look at that?

08:31.937 --> 08:34.270
Aw. Beautiful dress.

08:34.273 --> 08:35.739
Thank you.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.441
I stole it.

08:46.755 --> 08:47.922
Klaus?

08:49.458 --> 08:51.108
Klaus!

08:51.110 --> 08:52.510
Kla...

08:52.512 --> 08:54.762
Hello.
Did you not hear me?

08:54.764 --> 08:56.847
Of course I
heard you, Caroline.

08:56.849 --> 08:58.599
I think the whole of
Mystic Falls heard you.

08:58.601 --> 09:00.684
I'm in no mood for company.

09:00.686 --> 09:03.354
Well, I'm sorry that you're
having personal issues,

09:03.356 --> 09:05.639
but I have a real
crisis on my hands.

09:05.641 --> 09:07.858
Elena stole my prom dress.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.360
I went to pick it up,

09:09.362 --> 09:11.678
and the tailor said that
somebody else already did.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.398
And when I asked who, she
said she couldn't remember.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.852
Hello? The vervain is out
of the town water supply.

09:18.854 --> 09:20.421
She was compelled.

09:22.425 --> 09:24.825
It is not funny.

09:24.827 --> 09:26.076
I know. I know.

09:26.078 --> 09:28.279
Then stop laughing.

09:31.050 --> 09:32.800
Look, I know that prom
isn't important to you,

09:32.802 --> 09:34.835
but it's important to me.

09:34.837 --> 09:37.471
Surely finding another dress

09:37.473 --> 09:39.506
is well within your substantial
vampire capabilities.

09:39.508 --> 09:42.810
But I don't want
just another dress.

09:42.812 --> 09:47.514
I want to look hot, like
princess grace of Monaco hot.

09:47.516 --> 09:49.099
So...

09:49.101 --> 09:53.204
Could you please go back
into your creepy trophy case

09:53.206 --> 09:56.106
of family collectibles
and dig me out

09:56.108 --> 09:58.442
something of royal caliber?

10:06.952 --> 10:09.069
Where's the disco ball?

10:09.071 --> 10:10.704
Caroline's been working
on this for a while.

10:10.706 --> 10:13.173
It's a, uh, photo yearbook

10:13.175 --> 10:15.459
of the senior class.

10:20.581 --> 10:23.550
Isn't that photo from
first day of freshman year?

10:28.506 --> 10:31.859
My mom took that when she
dropped us off at school.

10:41.319 --> 10:44.638
I'm gonna get a seizure if I
keep staring at these screens.

10:56.284 --> 11:00.220
Why do I feel like we're at a
practice run of Caroline's wedding?

11:00.222 --> 11:02.289
Because I think we are.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.393
You are underage.

11:06.395 --> 11:08.646
You're overage, and honestly,
it's kind of creepy.

11:08.648 --> 11:11.131
Oh, come on. What bad-ass
senior is complete

11:11.133 --> 11:14.735
without a prom date that's
slightly too old for high school?

11:14.737 --> 11:16.654
Please don't refer
to yourself as my date.

11:16.656 --> 11:19.440
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your boyfriend.

11:20.641 --> 11:22.576
Something I said?

11:24.246 --> 11:26.163
I'm not doing this.

11:26.165 --> 11:29.116
You're not gonna deny that I'm
your boyfriend, now, are you?

11:29.118 --> 11:31.001
What are you doing?

11:31.003 --> 11:33.120
Trying to stir
some feelings in me?

11:33.122 --> 11:35.456
Ironic, since you,
my sire, are the one

11:35.458 --> 11:37.591
who had me turn them off.

11:37.593 --> 11:40.010
Yeah, well, hindsight is almost
a bigger bitch than you.

11:40.012 --> 11:41.545
You're nothing to me, Damon.

11:41.547 --> 11:45.132
Really? Then why tell me
you're in love with me?

11:45.134 --> 11:47.034
Why tell me it's
the most real thing

11:47.036 --> 11:49.103
you've ever felt in your life?

11:49.105 --> 11:51.038
I told you I loved you
because I was sired to you,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.006
and now that I'm not, I know
that none of it was real,

11:53.008 --> 11:55.275
but if you still
think that it was,

11:55.277 --> 11:58.612
I mean, maybe you're the one who
needs help with your emotions,

11:58.614 --> 12:00.514
not me.

12:04.369 --> 12:06.203
Uh-oh. Friend patrol.

12:06.205 --> 12:09.707
Hey. I know we haven't
really talked since...

12:09.709 --> 12:11.425
Everything, but I just...

12:11.427 --> 12:13.043
I want to say that I miss you.

12:13.045 --> 12:16.046
Me, too,
and we want to help you.

12:16.048 --> 12:17.664
What are you gonna do...

12:17.666 --> 12:19.466
get me a job at the grill?

12:19.468 --> 12:20.968
I don't want you to
look back and realize

12:20.970 --> 12:22.636
you missed out on the
best part of senior year.

12:22.638 --> 12:24.755
Spare me, Matt.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.507
If you had the choice, you would
have turned your emotions off

12:26.509 --> 12:28.092
the second that Vicki died.

12:28.094 --> 12:30.710
Hey, you shut it off
because all you could feel

12:30.712 --> 12:33.230
were the horrible things
happening to you.

12:33.232 --> 12:35.215
You still have friends
who love you.

12:35.217 --> 12:36.483
I thought you were going
to bring Jeremy back,

12:36.485 --> 12:38.102
but it turned out you were just

12:38.104 --> 12:39.937
a brainwashed crazy person,

12:39.939 --> 12:42.489
so technically, you're
a walking reminder

12:42.491 --> 12:44.641
of all the horrible things
that have happened to me.

12:51.116 --> 12:53.000
Bonnie, wait.
I need some air.

12:53.002 --> 12:54.885
Caroline's right.

12:54.887 --> 12:57.037
Elena's gone.

13:28.603 --> 13:30.204
Is this real?

13:30.206 --> 13:32.439
Does it matter?

13:35.543 --> 13:38.128
May I have this dance?

13:50.758 --> 13:52.309
Let go of me
or I will bite you.

13:52.311 --> 13:54.144
Oh, come on.

13:54.146 --> 13:56.263
I'm the one that hates
to dance, remember?

13:56.265 --> 13:57.964
Yeah, and now
I finally see why.

13:57.966 --> 13:59.299
Hmm.

14:02.086 --> 14:05.189
So are you and Bonnie,
like, a thing?

14:05.191 --> 14:08.808
We're not a thing.
We're friends.

14:08.810 --> 14:11.078
So who are you here with?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.529
No one.

14:12.531 --> 14:14.531
Go on. I know
what you're thinking...

14:14.533 --> 14:16.200
why didn't I just
compel myself a date?

14:16.202 --> 14:19.419
You know, actually
I was thinking,

14:19.421 --> 14:21.271
I wonder if Bonnie wants ice.

14:21.273 --> 14:24.541
Oh. Could I ask
you a question?

14:24.543 --> 14:26.627
Why? Apparently you
already seem to know

14:26.629 --> 14:28.328
everything I'm thinking, so...

14:30.015 --> 14:33.100
Do you think that I would
make a good human?

14:37.188 --> 14:40.190
I think that "good" is a
hard word to live up to.

14:40.192 --> 14:43.510
I've never seen you do
anything remotely good,

14:43.512 --> 14:46.063
so...

14:46.065 --> 14:48.198
Honestly, no, I don't.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.016
I'm sorry.

14:55.540 --> 14:59.826
So you're just here to help
Rebekah get the cure, right,

14:59.828 --> 15:02.212
on what happens to be the
most sentimental night

15:02.214 --> 15:03.697
in high school.

15:03.699 --> 15:06.083
You think this is
my cry for help?

15:06.085 --> 15:10.704
I'd be happy to show you what a
real cry for help sounds like.

15:10.706 --> 15:12.055
Hmm.

15:13.308 --> 15:16.059
So this...

15:17.562 --> 15:19.546
Us...

15:19.548 --> 15:21.348
You feel nothing?

15:21.350 --> 15:22.983
I feel nothing.

15:24.319 --> 15:25.903
I don't believe you.

15:25.905 --> 15:27.487
I don't care.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.576
So you don't remember

15:32.578 --> 15:34.894
what it used to feel like
when we would dance?

15:36.197 --> 15:38.999
When my hand
would touch your waist?

15:43.338 --> 15:45.088
Nope.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.510
How about this...

15:50.512 --> 15:53.013
When our fingers would touch?

15:57.352 --> 15:59.419
Nothing.

16:01.356 --> 16:03.523
And this?

16:20.575 --> 16:22.926
What heart?

16:54.755 --> 16:56.756
So how do I look?

16:56.758 --> 17:00.292
Are you kidding me? You look
like a backstabbing bi...

17:03.130 --> 17:07.717
the dress is beautiful,
and it brings out your eyes.

17:07.719 --> 17:10.903
Thanks. I thought
I'd do it a favor.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.690
Caroline, why don't
you come dance with me?

17:22.898 --> 17:24.817
I know you said
to kill her with kindness,

17:24.819 --> 17:27.685
but can't I just kill her?

17:27.688 --> 17:29.288
I see you found a dress.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.123
It's from Klaus.
Mmm.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.491
Don't ask.

17:32.493 --> 17:34.126
You know you have him

17:34.128 --> 17:36.328
wrapped around
your little finger, right?

17:36.330 --> 17:38.080
If I had Klaus wrapped
around my finger,

17:38.082 --> 17:41.634
then I would be here
with Tyler right now.

17:41.636 --> 17:44.470
Are you making any progress
with the dress thief?

17:44.472 --> 17:46.088
I don't know.
I think it's affecting me

17:46.090 --> 17:47.840
a lot more than
it's affecting her.

17:47.842 --> 17:49.708
What do you mean?

17:49.710 --> 17:53.813
Every time I tell myself
that I'm moving on,

17:53.815 --> 17:56.932
there's this part of me that
just can't seem to shake her.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.383
That's normal, Stefan.

17:58.385 --> 18:00.069
You guys were in love.

18:00.071 --> 18:01.487
That doesn't go
away just because

18:01.489 --> 18:03.388
you declare that
you're moving on.

18:03.390 --> 18:08.194
Then how does anyone
ever seem to move on?

18:08.196 --> 18:10.362
I don't know.

18:10.364 --> 18:12.665
I think that someday,

18:12.667 --> 18:14.617
you'll meet someone new

18:14.619 --> 18:16.836
and you'll fall madly in love.

18:16.838 --> 18:19.255
And you'll have moved on

18:19.257 --> 18:21.874
without even realizing it.

18:26.513 --> 18:29.932
I can't just make you
prom queen.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.017
It is based on votes.

18:32.019 --> 18:34.303
And you have approximately
none so far.

18:34.305 --> 18:36.856
And you can't just
help out a friend?

18:36.858 --> 18:38.474
No, I can't.

18:38.476 --> 18:40.259
And you can't make me.
I drink vervain tea now.

18:40.261 --> 18:41.760
I was not going to compel you.

18:41.762 --> 18:44.230
You can't be compelled,
but you can be killed.

18:44.232 --> 18:45.731
Rebekah wins prom queen.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.366
Got it?

18:47.368 --> 18:49.869
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

18:49.871 --> 18:51.937
What you were about to do.

18:51.939 --> 18:53.706
I was not going
to threaten her.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.440
Remember that time
you tortured me

18:55.442 --> 18:57.159
until I told you
how to find the cure?

18:57.161 --> 18:58.577
You ruined my
relationship with Stefan

18:58.579 --> 18:59.879
and then you trapped
us with a werewolf?

18:59.881 --> 19:01.046
Yes. So?

19:01.048 --> 19:02.581
So you're not a good person.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.050
You're not gonna win
this cure by being yourself.

19:05.052 --> 19:08.304
So just stand there and
refrain from talking, ok?

19:13.643 --> 19:15.094
You and me.

19:15.096 --> 19:17.763
We're at senior prom.

19:22.636 --> 19:24.469
Do you miss me, Bonnie?

19:26.807 --> 19:30.276
Of course I do.

19:31.862 --> 19:34.663
Do you want this to be real?

19:37.918 --> 19:39.668
Yes.

19:41.137 --> 19:42.922
Then it can be.

19:44.007 --> 19:45.791
Bonnie...

19:45.793 --> 19:48.544
Your magic can bring
me back for good.

19:48.546 --> 19:51.163
You have the power
to do the spell now.

19:54.267 --> 19:58.137
Oh, my God. You're Silas.

19:58.139 --> 19:59.671
Get away from me.

20:00.941 --> 20:02.474
You need me, Bonnie.

20:02.476 --> 20:04.059
I don't need you.

20:04.061 --> 20:05.277
I don't want anything
to do with you.

20:05.279 --> 20:07.730
You have no idea
how dangerous you are.

20:07.732 --> 20:10.950
If I don't help you,
you'll kill yourself.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.118
You're trying to
get in my head.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.154
I'm just asking for your
help in return for mine.

20:15.156 --> 20:16.188
Leave me alone.

20:16.190 --> 20:18.123
Wake up on fire recently?

20:20.493 --> 20:21.944
Did you do that to me?

20:21.946 --> 20:24.296
Please, Bonnie, let me help
before you hurt somebody

20:24.298 --> 20:25.464
or yourself.

20:25.466 --> 20:26.865
You don't care about me.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.167
You only care about
bringing down the wall

20:28.169 --> 20:29.752
to the other side,
and I won't do it.

20:29.754 --> 20:31.670
Don't you want to see
Jeremy again?

20:31.672 --> 20:33.839
Not like this.

20:38.979 --> 20:40.980
Where did you get that?

20:40.982 --> 20:43.732
Our baby sister.

20:45.569 --> 20:47.286
Once she's human...

20:47.288 --> 20:50.356
It'll make no difference
to her whatsoever.

20:50.358 --> 20:52.074
Take it.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.862
Why would you give me this?

20:56.864 --> 20:59.231
We are immortal
apart from the stake.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.784
Now that it's yours,

21:01.786 --> 21:04.119
you have nothing to fear.

21:04.121 --> 21:08.173
Silas will continue
to torment me.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.209
Well, you've survived
endless torments

21:10.211 --> 21:11.827
throughout the centuries.

21:11.829 --> 21:13.195
You'll shake this.

21:13.197 --> 21:15.497
And if you can't,

21:15.499 --> 21:18.050
you outrun him.

21:20.021 --> 21:22.137
Yes, it's that simple.

21:22.139 --> 21:25.190
Without the cure,
what makes you think

21:25.192 --> 21:27.526
I'll spare your
beloved Katerina?

21:27.528 --> 21:29.812
Or have you figured
out, you're simply

21:29.814 --> 21:31.430
another spider in her web?

21:31.432 --> 21:33.232
You will spare her
because I am asking you

21:33.234 --> 21:34.566
to spare her.

21:34.568 --> 21:37.820
As your family, as your
only living brother,

21:37.822 --> 21:40.873
I would ask that you provide
me with this opportunity

21:40.875 --> 21:42.708
to feel, to care.

21:45.912 --> 21:48.080
To love.

21:51.217 --> 21:54.503
I gave you that opportunity.

21:54.505 --> 21:57.373
And you sided against me.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.757
So if I run,

21:58.759 --> 22:00.759
it will be to chase her.

22:00.761 --> 22:06.465
And as your
only living brother,

22:06.467 --> 22:08.867
I will make it
my cause that you

22:08.869 --> 22:11.737
never know a moment
of happiness.

22:15.025 --> 22:18.327
It is such a hollow
little life that you lead,

22:18.329 --> 22:19.828
eh, Klaus.

22:33.210 --> 22:35.461
You haven't seen
Bonnie, have you?

22:35.463 --> 22:36.995
She's probably in the bathroom.

22:36.997 --> 22:38.547
Every other girl is.

22:38.549 --> 22:40.382
And if you haven't noticed,

22:40.384 --> 22:42.434
I am sitting here
all on my own.

22:42.436 --> 22:44.803
So, please, will you put
me out of my misery

22:44.805 --> 22:46.271
and dance with me?

22:48.108 --> 22:49.508
I don't think so.

22:49.510 --> 22:51.110
Matt, please.

22:51.112 --> 22:53.178
This is a girl's
worst nightmare.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.280
Please.

23:05.075 --> 23:07.526
I thought about
what you said...

23:07.528 --> 23:09.128
about being good...

23:09.130 --> 23:11.080
and you're right.

23:11.082 --> 23:13.799
It won't be easy,
but it's worth trying.

23:13.801 --> 23:15.300
I don't understand
why my opinion

23:15.302 --> 23:16.969
is so important to you.

23:16.971 --> 23:18.537
Because
you're everything

23:18.539 --> 23:20.422
that I want to be.

23:20.424 --> 23:24.476
You're loyal, honest, kind.

23:24.478 --> 23:27.012
People root for you to succeed.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.647
Elena even died for you.

23:28.649 --> 23:30.733
I'm a bus boy, Rebekah, ok?

23:30.735 --> 23:32.101
It's not like

23:32.103 --> 23:34.069
I'm out saving the world.

23:36.089 --> 23:38.357
But you're human.

23:38.359 --> 23:42.745
You're so beautifully human.

23:45.115 --> 23:47.332
Aren't you on
"save Elena" duty?

23:49.335 --> 23:51.203
I'm taking a little breather.

23:56.177 --> 23:58.510
This prom sucks.

23:58.512 --> 24:01.079
This is our last dance
together, and it's awful.

24:01.081 --> 24:04.550
This is not how I wanted
to remember this night.

24:10.774 --> 24:12.224
Thank you.

24:18.566 --> 24:21.700
Well, if anyone asks, I'll
be at the after-party.

24:26.906 --> 24:28.373
We have a problem.

24:29.709 --> 24:31.243
It's like Jeremy was there.

24:31.245 --> 24:33.662
I could talk to him, feel him.

24:33.664 --> 24:34.897
Bonnie, that's what Silas does.

24:34.899 --> 24:36.114
You can't let him
get to you again.

24:36.116 --> 24:37.266
Yeah, because you all crazy

24:37.268 --> 24:38.584
and brainwashed.

24:38.586 --> 24:40.052
It's not a good look.

24:41.221 --> 24:42.671
What am I missing?

24:42.673 --> 24:44.056
Silas is appearing to Bonnie

24:44.058 --> 24:45.790
as my dead brother,

24:45.792 --> 24:47.059
which means he still wants her

24:47.061 --> 24:48.927
to do the spell.

24:48.929 --> 24:50.395
So? The nice thing
about having no feelings is

24:50.397 --> 24:52.181
you don't fear your enemies
on the other side.

24:52.183 --> 24:54.183
I'm not worried
about my enemies.

24:54.185 --> 24:56.602
It's people like Alaric...

24:56.604 --> 24:58.604
And Jeremy.

24:58.606 --> 24:59.988
Salvatore brothers
are annoying enough

24:59.990 --> 25:01.190
as it is.

25:01.192 --> 25:02.357
Can you imagine if my brother

25:02.359 --> 25:03.609
came back to the living?

25:03.611 --> 25:05.277
He'd spend every
waking hour trying

25:05.279 --> 25:06.778
to get my humanity back.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.866
Hey. Ok, the ballots
have been tallied,

25:10.868 --> 25:12.784
which means it's time
to announce

25:12.786 --> 25:15.170
this year's prom king
and queen.

25:15.172 --> 25:16.655
Look, one of us
should take her home.

25:16.657 --> 25:18.624
What? No. She's
safer here in public

25:18.626 --> 25:20.175
around all these people.

25:20.177 --> 25:21.627
There's no way Silas

25:21.629 --> 25:23.995
can make everyone see
the same thing all at once.

25:23.997 --> 25:25.214
Ok,
in the meantime,

25:25.216 --> 25:26.215
how do we look out
for a guy that

25:26.217 --> 25:27.299
can appear as anyone?

25:27.301 --> 25:28.467
All right.

25:28.469 --> 25:30.602
Your prom king and queen are...

25:30.604 --> 25:34.106
Matt Donovan
and Bonnie Bennett.

25:41.148 --> 25:45.850
Bonnie bloody
Bennett. Of course.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.156
Everyone's so worried
about Silas,

25:51.158 --> 25:53.292
but there's an obvious
solution to all of this.

25:53.294 --> 25:56.495
He needs Bonnie. He can't
do the spell without her.

25:56.497 --> 25:58.213
So if you can't kill Silas,

25:58.215 --> 26:01.133
kill his witch.

26:01.135 --> 26:02.668
I can't kill anyone.

26:02.670 --> 26:04.169
I'm supposed to be human.

26:04.171 --> 26:08.206
Maybe you can't, but I can.

26:27.037 --> 26:28.587
Tyler.

26:28.589 --> 26:31.223
I don't think you've
ever looked more beautiful.

26:31.225 --> 26:34.760
Oh, my God. Tyler.

26:39.132 --> 26:40.983
Oh, you can't be
here. Klaus...

26:40.985 --> 26:42.568
can't get in.

26:42.570 --> 26:44.470
Matt owns this place now.
He had to invite me inside.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.304
If Klaus finds out...

26:46.306 --> 26:48.307
he won't.
You didn't really think

26:48.309 --> 26:50.092
I was gonna miss prom, did you?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.648
Here. These are for you.

27:00.370 --> 27:05.624
Caroline Forbes, may I
please have this dance?

27:11.915 --> 27:13.899
You looking for Silas

27:13.901 --> 27:15.968
or you waxing nostalgic

27:15.970 --> 27:19.438
about misspent youth?

27:19.440 --> 27:22.524
What happened to you
being over it?

27:23.661 --> 27:25.461
What do you mean?

27:25.463 --> 27:27.096
Well, I mean, for a guy
who's ready to move on,

27:27.098 --> 27:28.647
you seemed pretty
convincing as a boyfriend

27:28.649 --> 27:30.115
out on the dance floor?

27:30.117 --> 27:32.484
I mean, isn't that
what we're doing,

27:32.486 --> 27:34.453
reminding Elena
of what she's lost?

27:34.455 --> 27:36.488
Like her feelings for you?

27:36.490 --> 27:38.624
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

27:38.626 --> 27:40.793
Hmm.
I mean...

27:40.795 --> 27:42.795
I don't mean to be
a dick, Damon,

27:42.797 --> 27:45.998
but Elena and I have a history.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.201
Memories, laughs,
ups and downs.

27:49.203 --> 27:51.203
It was a real relationship.

27:51.205 --> 27:54.673
I mean, what you have is
just a one-night stand

27:54.675 --> 27:56.541
that was probably the result

27:56.543 --> 27:57.810
of the sire-bond.

27:59.546 --> 28:01.146
Your mind is

28:01.148 --> 28:03.682
a very dark
and riveting place, Damon.

28:03.684 --> 28:06.551
Uh! Silas.

28:06.553 --> 28:09.655
Where's my brother,
you psychic freak?

28:09.657 --> 28:11.223
He's in the woods,

28:11.225 --> 28:13.492
where I convinced him
I was you.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.560
He's probably in a bit of
pain now, too.

28:15.562 --> 28:21.867
The witch is mine.
Stay away from her.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.753
Ugh!

28:35.181 --> 28:36.849
You need to get your
queen off the stage.

28:36.851 --> 28:38.967
I can't really do that
right now.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.636
You didn't hear it from me,

28:40.638 --> 28:43.222
but Elena's up to something.

28:52.699 --> 28:54.700
Congratulations, Bonnie.

28:54.702 --> 28:55.984
What do you want?

28:55.986 --> 28:57.435
For you to stop being
a problem.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.339
Bonnie.

29:17.341 --> 29:18.640
Something's
happening to me.

29:18.642 --> 29:19.624
Ok, just relax.

29:19.626 --> 29:21.059
No, I got to get out of here.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.600
What's going on?

29:28.602 --> 29:29.935
Remember when I told you

29:29.937 --> 29:31.904
to make Rebekah prom queen?

29:33.323 --> 29:35.140
No!

29:37.310 --> 29:39.311
You should have listened.

29:47.124 --> 29:50.600
April, April, come on.
Please wake up.

29:50.602 --> 29:52.001
April, come on!

29:52.003 --> 29:53.436
Please wake up.

29:53.438 --> 29:55.771
Matt, why did you
call... oh, my God.

29:55.773 --> 29:58.173
Rebekah, can you feed
her your blood?

29:58.175 --> 30:00.509
Can't we just call
911 or something?

30:00.511 --> 30:02.445
She's dying.
Please help her.

30:02.447 --> 30:05.014
I can't. If I heal her
with my vampire blood,

30:05.016 --> 30:06.816
Elijah won't give me the cure

30:06.818 --> 30:08.684
and I won't get to be human.

30:08.686 --> 30:10.736
How is this even
a choice right now?

30:10.738 --> 30:12.955
You want to be human?
Prove it. Be good.

30:12.957 --> 30:16.358
Do the right thing
and save her life.

30:24.868 --> 30:26.752
Stefan.

30:26.754 --> 30:29.388
Yeah.
I'm over here. Agh!

30:29.390 --> 30:32.174
Agh!

30:36.313 --> 30:38.514
Let me guess.

30:38.516 --> 30:40.883
An extremely handsome
man came up to you

30:40.885 --> 30:43.019
claiming to be me.

30:44.688 --> 30:47.740
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:49.076 --> 30:50.276
Bonnie, wait.

30:50.278 --> 30:51.494
Get away from me, Silas.

30:51.496 --> 30:52.728
We can help each other.

30:52.730 --> 30:54.447
This is what you do.

30:54.449 --> 30:55.798
You wait until I lose control

30:55.800 --> 30:57.066
and then you want to swoop in

30:57.068 --> 30:58.334
and save me.

30:58.336 --> 31:00.036
You really think
you have a choice?

31:00.038 --> 31:01.537
If you don't let me help you,

31:01.539 --> 31:03.956
your expression will consume
you from the inside out.

31:03.958 --> 31:06.842
Get away from me.

31:10.347 --> 31:13.366
You didn't try to do
that, did you?

31:13.368 --> 31:15.051
Your magic is taking on
a life of its own.

31:15.053 --> 31:17.419
You need help controlling it.

31:17.421 --> 31:20.022
Listen to me, Bonnie.
Breathe.

31:20.024 --> 31:23.092
I'll die before I let
you control me again.

31:23.094 --> 31:24.426
Bonnie, listen to me!

31:24.428 --> 31:27.262
Control, Bonnie! Control.

31:27.264 --> 31:31.117
Get out of my head!

32:10.857 --> 32:13.826
Bonnie, stop.
Bonnie.

32:17.647 --> 32:18.647
Bonnie...

32:18.649 --> 32:19.782
You're killing her.

32:19.784 --> 32:21.316
I know what I'm doing.

32:21.318 --> 32:24.253
That's the magic talking.
This is your best fried.

32:24.255 --> 32:26.822
Damn it, Bonnie.

32:29.259 --> 32:30.593
Bonnie...

32:30.595 --> 32:31.927
Please.

32:47.010 --> 32:48.343
You ok?

32:48.345 --> 32:50.345
No, I'm not ok.
I almost died.

32:50.347 --> 32:51.814
The shell of my best
friend almost killed me.

32:51.816 --> 32:53.515
None of this is ok.

32:55.518 --> 32:57.286
I got you.

32:58.455 --> 33:00.522
Ok.
Hey. Whoa.

33:06.163 --> 33:08.380
Plan "B."

33:22.545 --> 33:24.513
Thank you for saving her.

33:24.515 --> 33:26.215
Elena was right.

33:26.217 --> 33:27.800
I should have just stayed home.

33:27.802 --> 33:30.169
No one has to know
what you did.

33:30.171 --> 33:32.354
I won't tell anyone.

33:33.490 --> 33:35.841
You'd really do that for me?

33:35.843 --> 33:37.576
I would.

33:38.795 --> 33:43.032
And maybe I was a little harsh

33:43.034 --> 33:44.233
earlier.

33:44.235 --> 33:46.769
You wouldn't make
the worst human.

33:48.622 --> 33:50.940
Are you offering me
a job as a bus boy?

33:52.409 --> 33:54.510
You know, I'd look cute
in an apron.

33:55.545 --> 33:57.046
We'll see.

33:59.850 --> 34:03.418
I should probably
get April home.

34:03.420 --> 34:04.770
Ok.

34:09.192 --> 34:11.092
Try to stand up.

34:13.647 --> 34:16.065
Dear sweet April young.

34:16.067 --> 34:18.734
Now, there's a girl
with a future.

34:18.735 --> 34:19.935
She was dying,

34:19.937 --> 34:21.487
and I acted with human decency.

34:21.489 --> 34:23.405
You can't get more
human than that.

34:23.407 --> 34:26.275
Actually, you can.
You can stand idly by

34:26.277 --> 34:28.944
as poor April takes
her final breath.

34:28.946 --> 34:31.797
You can ask, "why does
this always happen"

34:31.799 --> 34:33.382
to innocent people?"

34:33.384 --> 34:35.501
"Where do the spirits go?"

34:35.503 --> 34:39.288
"Was there anything
I could have done?"

34:39.290 --> 34:41.290
That is what it means
to be human, sister.

34:41.292 --> 34:43.592
You give humanity
too much credit.

34:45.094 --> 34:47.462
Are you gonna tell Elijah?

34:47.464 --> 34:51.900
No. No. You are.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.571
You're home.

34:55.572 --> 34:59.074
And how did our
cinderella fare?

34:59.076 --> 35:01.310
I won't lie. There
were complications.

35:01.312 --> 35:03.312
You'll tell
him that you cheated,

35:03.314 --> 35:04.479
that you failed,

35:04.481 --> 35:07.149
that you don't deserve
the cure.

35:07.151 --> 35:09.868
But I passed your test
with flying colors.

35:09.870 --> 35:13.339
If this is what you
truly want...

35:13.341 --> 35:15.107
It's yours.

35:21.264 --> 35:24.550
Why is it so
hard for you to let me be happy?

35:24.552 --> 35:26.936
Because your happiness comes
at the expense of my sanity,

35:26.938 --> 35:28.554
because I refuse to entertain

35:28.556 --> 35:30.306
yet another one of your whims,

35:30.308 --> 35:32.258
because you are bored

35:32.260 --> 35:35.110
and you're looking for
a reason to matter.

35:36.563 --> 35:38.414
Thankfully I don't have
to waste any more breath

35:38.416 --> 35:42.151
fighting you on the subject.

35:42.153 --> 35:44.036
What does that mean?

35:45.188 --> 35:47.356
Nik, what does that mean?

35:50.510 --> 35:52.361
I guess it's time

35:52.363 --> 35:54.129
that I turned into a pumpkin.

35:54.131 --> 35:56.715
Thank you, Elijah.

36:09.013 --> 36:10.262
Rebekah?

36:10.264 --> 36:13.182
Elijah, I think Nik's
up to something.

36:13.184 --> 36:14.984
Where did you go?

36:14.986 --> 36:16.735
I'm still at the prom.

36:16.737 --> 36:18.320
Look, don't do anything with
the cure until I see you.

36:18.322 --> 36:19.571
Something's not right.

36:19.573 --> 36:22.324
Elijah? Hello?

36:22.326 --> 36:24.726
Elijah, do not take
your eyes off that cure.

36:24.728 --> 36:27.813
I think it might be
a little late for that.

36:55.988 --> 36:57.288
I have to go soon.

37:00.743 --> 37:02.661
People will be here
for the party.

37:02.663 --> 37:04.296
And if anyone sees me...

37:04.298 --> 37:06.331
I know. I know.

37:12.972 --> 37:16.174
Thank you for
the best prom ever.

37:39.699 --> 37:41.516
Was it worth it

37:41.518 --> 37:43.652
to see her smile,

37:43.654 --> 37:46.588
to make her dream
night come true?

37:48.240 --> 37:52.694
Was it worth it?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.035
In the shared interest
of giving Caroline

38:00.037 --> 38:01.569
the night of her dreams...

38:01.571 --> 38:04.022
I'm going to allow
you 5 seconds

38:04.024 --> 38:06.891
before I rip your heart
out of your chest.

38:08.227 --> 38:12.230
5...4...3...

38:17.653 --> 38:20.071
She might not feel much,
but she's gonna feel that

38:20.073 --> 38:22.057
in the morning.

38:22.059 --> 38:23.658
So what's the plan?

38:23.660 --> 38:25.944
When Bonnie was
whaling on her tonight,

38:25.946 --> 38:27.846
I could see it in her eyes.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.714
Elena thought she
was gonna die.

38:29.716 --> 38:31.900
She was scared.

38:33.803 --> 38:35.503
Fear.

38:35.505 --> 38:38.106
Last time I checked, one of
those pesky human emotions.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.759
So plan "C"...

38:42.695 --> 38:44.262
Make her life a living hell.

38:44.264 --> 38:46.514
You care to talk about
our other problem?

38:46.516 --> 38:48.049
You know, the one that can be

38:48.051 --> 38:49.567
anyone anywhere at anytime.

38:49.569 --> 38:51.469
Silas still needs Bonnie.

38:51.471 --> 38:53.488
And if tonight is
any indication,

38:53.490 --> 38:55.056
she's no pushover.

38:55.058 --> 38:56.908
She's not gonna let
him manipulate her,

38:56.910 --> 38:58.860
not anymore.

38:58.862 --> 39:00.779
I wouldn't underestimate
his talents.

39:00.781 --> 39:02.664
He fooled the hell out
of both of us.

39:04.817 --> 39:06.835
What did he say to you anyway?

39:08.088 --> 39:09.454
He led me out in the woods,

39:09.456 --> 39:10.622
claiming he saw Silas,

39:10.624 --> 39:12.290
and then he staked me.

39:13.843 --> 39:15.460
How did he get to you?

39:18.799 --> 39:20.515
Talked about his hair.

39:20.517 --> 39:22.634
I figured it had to be you.

39:22.636 --> 39:24.102
Funny.

39:29.141 --> 39:30.642
You coming?

39:34.363 --> 39:36.364
Yeah.

39:54.917 --> 39:57.719
Klaus, I hear Elijah

39:57.721 --> 39:59.304
has refused you the cure

39:59.306 --> 40:01.372
and in return, you have
refused me my freedom.

40:01.374 --> 40:03.675
Shame on you both.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.143
But while you boys sort
out your problems,

40:05.145 --> 40:07.929
I have one last thing
to offer you.

40:07.931 --> 40:10.047
I've caught wind that there
is a witch in New Orleans

40:10.049 --> 40:13.685
named Jane-Anne Deveraux
plotting a move against you.

40:13.687 --> 40:14.936
Hunt her down.

40:14.938 --> 40:17.355
What she has to say
will rattle you

40:17.357 --> 40:20.358
so deeply to your core
that chasing little old me

40:20.360 --> 40:22.360
will be the least of your
concerns.

40:22.362 --> 40:24.863
It's been a fun
five centuries, Klaus,

40:24.865 --> 40:27.999
but I've worn down too many
good heels running from you.

40:28.001 --> 40:32.537
Love and hate, Katerina.

40:43.849 --> 40:45.383
Silas?

40:46.852 --> 40:48.970
I know it's you.

40:48.972 --> 40:50.605
My locator spell worked
without using

40:50.607 --> 40:53.024
any of your possessions.

40:53.026 --> 40:54.609
You're finally acknowledging

40:54.611 --> 40:56.344
how powerful you are.

40:56.346 --> 40:58.863
You're not Jeremy anymore.

40:58.865 --> 41:01.783
Is this the real you?

41:04.403 --> 41:07.238
Then tell me why you're hiding.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.492
Call it Qetsiyah's revenge.

41:10.494 --> 41:12.827
When she learned that
I didn't love her,

41:12.829 --> 41:15.530
she used her magic to ensure

41:15.532 --> 41:18.766
no woman could ever love me.

41:21.420 --> 41:23.004
It should come as no surprise

41:23.006 --> 41:26.724
that now I simply want to die.

41:26.726 --> 41:28.860
And I want you to.

41:28.862 --> 41:31.095
Even if it means bringing back

41:31.097 --> 41:34.549
every dead supernatural being?

41:38.270 --> 41:40.855
Show me your face.

41:57.268 --> 42:02.482
