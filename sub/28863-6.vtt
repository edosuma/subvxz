00:02.970 --> 00:05.139
(birds chirping)

00:07.375 --> 00:09.577
*

00:22.323 --> 00:24.525
(wagon rolling)

00:33.033 --> 00:35.736
OLIVER:
We were always finding things.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.242
Pens. Poetry.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.177
Socks.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.380
The astral plane
was like a magnet

00:46.414 --> 00:48.616
for lost dreams.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.223
Minds.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.925
That was the other thing
we found.

00:58.025 --> 01:01.262
In the real world,
when people lost their minds,

01:01.362 --> 01:04.232
they ended up here.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.566
(cooing)

01:05.599 --> 01:08.769
And who are we, then?

01:13.507 --> 01:16.644
(baby babbling)

01:25.085 --> 01:27.087
*

01:45.573 --> 01:46.640
Hmm.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.943
What you got today?

01:49.977 --> 01:52.246
A baby.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.014
A baby?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.583
Wow.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.650
Look at that.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.920
(sniffs)
Can I have him?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.989
It's a her, I think, and no.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.091
If you want a baby,
you can scavenge one yourself.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.761
(scoffs) "Scavenge."
That's... I'm a wolf.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.663
Wolves don't scavenge.
We hunt.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.131
You're lucky I don't hunt you.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.134
Well, you live just next door.
Wouldn't be hard.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.069
Have you told her
about the Holocaust yet?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.439
-The...? What?
-Got to tell her.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.107
Prepare her, Oliver.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.443
You can't grow up too fast.
That's my motto.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.944
Also, herpes.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.814
Make sure you tell her
about herpes, like, right away.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.784
-(sighs) Get away! Go on!
-(growls)

02:31.619 --> 02:34.087
Shoo! Get away! Get away!

02:34.188 --> 02:36.890
Don't forget chlamydia.
(howls)

02:38.459 --> 02:39.793
Wife.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.796
Husband.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.699
-What did we scavenge today?
-Well, half a sandwich,

02:45.799 --> 02:49.203
a very nice sock
and, uh, this baby.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.772
Oh, baby.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.541
Well, look at that.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.843
(gasps) Oh.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.648
Oh, aren't you adorable.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.350
Let's get you inside.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.319
(baby cooing)

03:05.353 --> 03:07.355
*

03:09.690 --> 03:11.892
(The Wolf howling)

03:24.738 --> 03:26.974
(howling continues)

03:29.543 --> 03:32.045
(siren wailing)

03:39.520 --> 03:41.722
Mm.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.531
What should we call her?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.433
The soup?

03:52.533 --> 03:54.568
No, not the soup; the baby.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.604
Oh, her name is Sydney.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.272
How do you know?

03:58.372 --> 04:01.008
She told me.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.543
What else did she say?

04:02.576 --> 04:06.079
Well, nothing. She's a baby.

04:06.113 --> 04:10.183
She looks familiar somehow.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.086
Syd. Sydney.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.689
It's okay.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.359
Everything's okay.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.929
-Mama's got you.
-(pounding on walls)

04:22.763 --> 04:25.065
(The Wolf howling)

04:27.100 --> 04:28.569
Don't.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.604
I won't.

04:30.704 --> 04:35.042
Although, he did blow
the paper house down last time.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.481
This house is straw, though--
Mighty Straw.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.450
It should hold.

04:42.550 --> 04:46.253
(wind whistling)

04:46.286 --> 04:49.790
-(wind howling loudly)
-(house creaking, rumbling)

04:52.393 --> 04:55.529
I'll just go
and chat with him, shall I?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.531
(panting)

04:57.631 --> 05:00.468
Oh, hey. (chuckles)

05:00.568 --> 05:01.635
I was just, uh...

05:01.735 --> 05:03.437
(exhales)

05:04.838 --> 05:06.574
This is Cynthia.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.309
I found her wandering alone
in the woods.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.646
She's lost her innocence,
which is a win for this guy.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.484
Plus, hey, she brought all these
dirty needles with her,

05:16.517 --> 05:19.787
so I was thinking... party? Huh?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.590
(sniffs) Is that soup?

05:22.690 --> 05:23.824
No.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.727
(growls)

05:26.827 --> 05:28.462
Hello, Melanie.

05:28.496 --> 05:31.331
-This is Cynthia.
-CYNTHIA: Hi.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.802
She's given up all hope.
(chuckles)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.203
Isn't that great?

05:36.303 --> 05:39.540
Look, we're trying
to have a nice life here

05:39.640 --> 05:42.209
and raise this baby
with wonder and magic,

05:42.309 --> 05:45.045
so we need to keep
the real world out.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.815
You guys like magic?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.850
'Cause I can do magic.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.553
(chuckles)
It was in my sleeve.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.054
Go away.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.390
-(growling)
-Not you, hon.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.191
Come in. Have some soup.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.568
Sorry.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.036
(roaring)

06:09.069 --> 06:11.539
Listen, don't be mad.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.175
(sighs)

06:22.750 --> 06:24.718
We should move.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.387
(The Wolf howling in distance)

06:36.697 --> 06:38.899
*

06:45.038 --> 06:47.240
(indistinct whispering)

06:50.177 --> 06:52.379
(insects trilling)

07:01.321 --> 07:04.057
*

07:14.802 --> 07:16.103
There we go.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.438
That's perfect.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.029
Oh, yes, that's perfect for...
(continues indistinctly)

07:47.167 --> 07:49.670
Why does some music
make you happy

07:49.770 --> 07:52.673
but other music make you sad?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.007
That's a good question.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.408
Well, uh, do you know
the difference

07:55.509 --> 07:57.477
between a major
and a minor chord?

07:57.511 --> 07:59.513
I'm five.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.683
No excuse. I'll show you
when we get home.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.321
Why do people use umbrellas
in the rain but not the snow?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.591
OLIVER:
Quiet now.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.062
Whose stuff is this?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.330
(sighs)
People in the real world.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.332
When they forget
about something,

08:19.366 --> 08:23.136
when it stops being important,
it comes here.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.008
Oh.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.444
-Oh.
-I'm gonna call her Heady.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.689
Little bird.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.023
Not that way.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.126
Why not?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.198
(machinery whirring)

08:53.100 --> 08:54.702
What is it?

08:55.703 --> 08:59.172
It-it's called the ostrich.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.208
Oh, wait, that's not right.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.177
It's the big bird, isn't it?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.179
No, the city.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.215
It's called the city.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.251
Also known as the real world.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.553
What makes it real?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.760
I'll explain when you're older.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.561
No, now.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.097
That's not the way it works,
little bird.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.667
I'm the daddy,
and you're the baby,

09:26.767 --> 09:30.537
and I'll tell you about the
real world when you're older.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.841
Now, come on. Mommy's making
stuffed animal pie.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.843
Mmm.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.078
We don't want to be late.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.905
*

10:04.938 --> 10:07.140
(flies buzzing)

10:30.463 --> 10:33.734
People think death is scary.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.969
It's pretty scary, huh?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.604
I mean, look at it.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.974
All oozy,
and what are those, maggots?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.510
That's just nature.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.347
Mm, kids die, too, you know.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.851
Everybody. Your parents. Ooh.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.822
That's got to be scary,
knowing that, huh? Mm.

10:54.922 --> 10:59.126
My mom told me that death
is just part of life.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.862
(groans) She did, huh?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.030
OLIVER:
Sydney!

11:03.130 --> 11:04.664
-(The Wolf growls)
-Got to go. Bye.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.335
Wait, wait, wait. Did she
tell you about chlamydia?

11:15.108 --> 11:18.211
Tell me a bedtime story.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.148
MELANIE:
Hmm.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.883
Oh.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.356
Once upon a time,

11:29.389 --> 11:31.524
there was a girl

11:31.558 --> 11:36.229
who had the most
extraordinary ability.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.000
She could feel everything
the animals felt.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.071
When a donkey stubbed its toe,
her toe hurt.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.840
Every time a monkey got sad,

11:46.874 --> 11:49.042
she got sad.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.945
It was her special power.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.315
And she called her special power

11:55.415 --> 11:57.684
"Empathy."

11:57.717 --> 12:00.520
And Empathy was her friend.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.757
They did everything together.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.900
But it's a hard thing
for a little girl to share

12:13.000 --> 12:14.868
the feelings of others.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.343
And she started to wonder,

12:23.443 --> 12:27.047
"Where do they...

12:27.080 --> 12:31.318
end and I begin?"

12:47.300 --> 12:51.338
No. No. No.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.308
(distant howling)

12:58.778 --> 13:00.313
(gasps)

13:01.781 --> 13:03.616
Cynthia.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.288
Hey.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.291
Do you ever miss your parents?

13:11.391 --> 13:12.993
Your real parents.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.495
Back in the real world.

13:15.595 --> 13:19.532
Wasn't your mom a lush?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.302
I love that word. "Lush."

13:22.402 --> 13:25.973
It sounds so... positive.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.474
Which, uh...

13:27.507 --> 13:29.542
Remember how she used to
tuck you in at night

13:29.642 --> 13:33.413
with flecks of vomit
in her hair?

13:33.513 --> 13:35.282
I live here now.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.852
-With the rivers and trees.
-Mm...

13:38.952 --> 13:40.587
And Kenny?

13:40.687 --> 13:43.790
Do you ever miss Kenny?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.058
Kenny beat me.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.628
Kenny's real sorry, baby.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.099
He wants you to come home
real bad.

13:52.199 --> 13:56.469
He love-love-loves you.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.906
I have to go inside.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.707
-Hey.
-(gasps)

14:02.042 --> 14:05.012
Look what I found.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.646
Hmm? (chuckles)

14:06.679 --> 14:08.248
I don't do that anymore.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.817
Aw... come on.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.319
Sure, you do.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.689
Don't be scared, gorgeous.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.027
You think the light bulb
is afraid of the dark?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.697
The light bulb loves the dark.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.904
'Cause in the dark...

14:33.873 --> 14:36.376
...it can shine.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.915
-(sighs softly)
-Shine for me, baby.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.504
(birds chirping)

15:04.604 --> 15:06.739
*

15:23.556 --> 15:25.758
*

15:28.561 --> 15:31.931
MELANIE:
So, that's where
babies come from.

15:32.032 --> 15:37.604
And in a couple years,
your body will start to change

15:37.637 --> 15:39.939
to be more like Mommy's.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.976
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.978
Any questions?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.215
What's chlamydia?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.451
Where'd you hear that word?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.954
From The Wolf.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.926
Uh, well...

15:59.959 --> 16:02.629
um, you know how,
when someone sneezes on you,

16:02.729 --> 16:03.997
you catch a cold?

16:04.097 --> 16:07.100
Well, that's because the cold
is a virus,

16:07.134 --> 16:09.969
and the sneeze transfers
the virus to you.

16:10.070 --> 16:14.274
And chlamydia is kind of like
a cold, except for your vagina.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.978
And, uh, you get it by having
unprotected sex with someone

16:19.079 --> 16:21.814
who has that virus.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.950
Does that make sense?

16:25.752 --> 16:28.988
-Bodies are weird.
-(Melanie chuckles)

16:29.022 --> 16:33.626
Well, I think the word you're
looking for is "beautiful."

16:33.660 --> 16:36.096
(crickets chirping,
frogs croaking)

16:37.230 --> 16:39.666
(laughter echoing)

16:42.335 --> 16:44.771
(making smooching sounds)

16:44.871 --> 16:46.673
(grunts)

16:49.342 --> 16:52.045
(birds screeching)

16:54.581 --> 16:55.848
(gasping)

16:58.318 --> 17:00.187
(distorted screaming)

17:01.421 --> 17:02.522
(distorted):
David.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.492
(whimpering):
No. No. No.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.027
(continues whimpering)

17:15.135 --> 17:17.537
MELANIE:
She's having dreams about it.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.540
Is she?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.609
"It" what?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.877
Her life.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.013
Outside.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.717
Whatever happened
that brought her here.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.386
That'll pass.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.888
Won't it?

17:35.988 --> 17:39.326
Depends on if she decides
to go back or not.

17:39.426 --> 17:43.730
(chuckling): Back? Why would
anyone want to go back?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.933
If she feels unresolved.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.969
If there's something
she needs to do.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.243
I swear, I... I feel like...

17:56.276 --> 17:58.611
we know her.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.681
From before.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.317
There is no "before" for us.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.256
MELANIE:
Hmm.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.224
Sydney.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.860
-Yes, Mama?
-Come tell Daddy your dream.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.581
I forgot.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.117
Now... little bird,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.653
you know that Mommy and Daddy
can't help you

18:40.753 --> 18:43.122
unless you use your words.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.462
That's okay.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.299
When you're ready.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.635
*

18:55.668 --> 18:58.104
(crickets chirping,
frogs croaking)

19:04.744 --> 19:06.179
DAVID:
I'm sorry.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.348
Don't worry.
None of this will happen.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.349
No.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.350
I'll fix it.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.151
I promise.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.324
(screaming)

19:17.424 --> 19:19.792
(indistinct, distorted chatter)

19:19.826 --> 19:23.663
(screaming continues)

19:24.797 --> 19:27.334
(whimpers)

19:29.269 --> 19:31.738
(heavy, gruff breathing)

19:42.715 --> 19:45.685
Good night, my sunshine.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.088
(night bird hooting in distance)

19:56.696 --> 19:58.665
(deep inhale)

19:58.698 --> 20:01.334
(wind whistling)

20:01.368 --> 20:03.236
(deep inhale)

20:03.336 --> 20:06.038
-(wind howling)
-(house rumbling)

20:15.515 --> 20:18.050
(The Wolf howling)

20:19.552 --> 20:21.754
OLIVER:
We have to move.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.403
(indistinct chatter)

20:36.503 --> 20:37.737
Hey! Hey!

20:37.837 --> 20:40.873
OLIVER:
Then the lean years came.

20:40.907 --> 20:45.077
We moved from the woods
to the gutter,

20:45.111 --> 20:48.381
trying to escape the knowledge.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.451
Wife.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.720
Husband.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.688
-Where's daughter?
-She's inside.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.790
Studying long division.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.263
(indistinct, lively chatter)

21:10.737 --> 21:12.271
(door opens)

21:17.810 --> 21:19.879
What ho, daughter?

21:21.748 --> 21:25.051
-Math makes sense.
-Yes. It does.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.786
Just add up the numbers.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.389
Or subtract, divide, multiply.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.123
Like me, for example.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.495
How I'm 16 now.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.196
Ready to learn about the world.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.933
Well, I can tell you everything
there is to know about old shoes

21:40.967 --> 21:42.569
and how to live with them.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.804
Hint: fumigation is key.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.106
You know what I mean.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.081
Did you have the dream again?

21:55.181 --> 21:56.616
No.

21:56.649 --> 22:00.487
It just feels like
I'm supposed to do something.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.522
But I don't know what.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.491
That's normal.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.992
It's a big world.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.994
And there's so much
you haven't seen yet.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.996
Because you won't show me.

22:12.031 --> 22:16.168
It's about the order of things,
the order you learn.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.538
When you were young,
we let you be wild

22:18.638 --> 22:20.973
because wildness is important.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.343
But as you got older,
we gave you structure

22:24.444 --> 22:26.212
so you'd feel safe.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.381
I can take care of myself.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.982
Here's something.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.019
The secret of life.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.987
If you feel safe
when you're young,

22:35.021 --> 22:37.857
you will feel safe
when you're old.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.860
I feel safe.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.195
And we want
that feeling to last.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.698
-You're not old yet.
-Yes, I am.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.966
No.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.102
You have your whole life
to be old.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.740
But today, you're still young.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.175
Trust me.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.311
You're doing this right.

22:59.412 --> 23:03.382
We have to learn about love
before we can learn about hate.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.387
Otherwise, everything
goes to hell.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.595
(indistinct chatter)

23:15.695 --> 23:17.897
-(gasping)
-(woman hisses)

23:17.997 --> 23:20.533
(violin playing a lively tune)

23:33.212 --> 23:35.915
(distant, rhythmic thumping)

23:44.591 --> 23:47.093
(thumping grows louder)

23:59.238 --> 24:01.273
WOMAN:
Better to leave it.

24:01.307 --> 24:04.143
They get bitter
when they come here.

24:12.251 --> 24:16.155
Hey, sunshine. Hey.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.326
Where did you go?

24:20.426 --> 24:23.295
Here. Just here.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.799
These are my kids,
Sweetie and Blue.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.635
You like vodka?

24:28.735 --> 24:30.136
(chuckling):
What? No.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.671
I don't know.

24:31.771 --> 24:32.972
Oh, it's good.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.007
They've got vanilla
and strawberry.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.976
Choke chain?

24:37.777 --> 24:38.945
Are you...

24:38.978 --> 24:40.947
How are Mom and Dad?

24:40.980 --> 24:44.150
Good. I'm sure they'd love it
if you came by the shoe shop.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.853
-The shop?
-Yeah, we live right...

24:46.953 --> 24:48.688
right near the park.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.690
(chuckles):
Oh.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.859
We like it over there.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.761
We love it.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.428
Maybe we could...

24:56.529 --> 25:00.733
I mean, they probably don't
remember me, right?

25:00.833 --> 25:03.102
No, they do.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.205
We talk about you all the time.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.047
Look.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.049
What are you doing right now?

25:17.149 --> 25:19.085
Because we're just...

25:19.185 --> 25:21.020
we were gonna...

25:21.053 --> 25:23.522
We live down there.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.224
Right down there.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.661
Maybe you could come over.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.862
We've got...

25:29.896 --> 25:32.999
Hey, do you like video games?

25:33.032 --> 25:35.001
And I've got all the cereals.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.303
Cocoa nubs and fruity chews.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.338
And movies about slavery.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.207
Do you know about slavery?

25:41.307 --> 25:43.710
BLUE:
They're super cool flicks.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.878
So much whipping.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.748
Jerome would love
to see you, too.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.717
Jerome?

25:57.857 --> 26:00.059
(flies buzzing)

26:01.894 --> 26:04.063
(heavy, gruff breathing)

26:16.575 --> 26:18.577
I have to go.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.116
Don't forget your heart.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.418
(heartbeat thumping)

26:40.967 --> 26:43.936
I'm not going.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.438
I'm never going.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.877
Where?

26:50.977 --> 26:54.380
The real world.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.249
I don't want that.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.819
Any of that.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.057
I know, honey.

27:05.157 --> 27:08.895
But here's the thing:

27:08.995 --> 27:12.298
The real world needs you.

27:12.331 --> 27:16.969
All those bad things,
they don't have to be bad.

27:17.003 --> 27:20.673
They can be fixed.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.778
See, you got this backwards.

27:25.812 --> 27:29.181
We're not trying to protect you
from the real world.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.318
We're helping you be the person
the world needs.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.824
So you can save it.

27:40.159 --> 27:44.831
What if I don't want to go?

27:49.135 --> 27:53.439
We're not put on this Earth
to think of only ourselves.

27:53.539 --> 27:57.376
You know that, right?

28:01.914 --> 28:03.850
(door creaks open)

28:03.950 --> 28:06.552
(turkey gobbling)

28:08.855 --> 28:10.622
Look what I found.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.125
We talked about this, remember?

28:13.225 --> 28:14.794
No livestock in the house.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.964
-Are you livestock?
-SYD: Okay.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.365
We're gonna save her.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.267
Well, I think it's a he.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.470
No. Cynthia.

28:25.304 --> 28:28.374
She ran into Cynthia.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.710
-She's with The Wolf.
-And we're gonna save her.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.214
-Now, hon...
-No.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.349
You taught me
to be a good person,

28:37.383 --> 28:40.486
and this is what good people do.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.922
So we're gonna save her.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.224
*

28:49.261 --> 28:51.497
(indistinct chatter)

29:03.275 --> 29:05.477
*

29:25.764 --> 29:28.434
(string instruments playing
lively tune in distance)

29:42.081 --> 29:44.283
(door creaking)

30:04.136 --> 30:06.338
*

30:09.275 --> 30:11.177
SYD:
Do you think she's okay?

30:11.277 --> 30:14.213
Cynthia?
Well, she's a drug addict

30:14.313 --> 30:16.849
who lives with a wolf, so no.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.118
Maybe he won't care.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.453
Don't be naive.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.790
Real grown-ups aren't naive.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.693
You think I'm a grown-up.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.529
If we survive this, you will be.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.634
Do you remember that wall
we built?

30:35.667 --> 30:38.037
-The rock wall?
-Of course.

30:38.137 --> 30:41.440
Why did we do that?
It didn't do anything.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.043
It was a wall.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.212
It did... wall things.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.380
You know what I mean.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.382
Your mother and I taught you
to work hard

30:50.482 --> 30:52.584
so you'd know how to work hard.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.486
We taught you to ask questions

30:54.520 --> 30:56.422
so you'd know
how to answer questions.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.526
Plus, I like a nice rock wall.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.732
(whispers):
Did he see you?

31:06.832 --> 31:08.534
No.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.370
But he has our scent.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.373
(grunts, chuckles)

31:14.406 --> 31:17.709
(sniffing)

31:20.379 --> 31:22.881
(growls)

31:22.915 --> 31:24.450
-MELANIE: It's okay. It's okay.
-(Cynthia panting)

31:24.550 --> 31:27.586
-We're here. It's okay.
-(barking, growling)

31:29.355 --> 31:31.257
SYD:
It's me.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.725
Listen.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.895
I know you had a bad deal.

31:36.996 --> 31:41.067
You think you don't
deserve things.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.402
Love.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.772
(gasps)

31:46.872 --> 31:48.874
But you do.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.680
We love you.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.553
Come home.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.933
It doesn't matter.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.971
He's here.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.942
(distant howling)

32:27.946 --> 32:30.449
(insects chirping)

32:44.763 --> 32:47.466
You can't have her.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.305
Oliver.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.142
-Jerome.
-(growls)

32:56.175 --> 32:59.145
You can't beat me.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.513
I'm a wild animal.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.750
(howling)

33:09.188 --> 33:11.890
I still have a few tricks.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.811
There's only one way
this can end.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.084
A rap battle.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.527
-(beat playing)
-(cheering, applause)

33:59.238 --> 34:02.541
* I'm the old wizard
who lives in the shoe *

34:02.574 --> 34:05.043
* The slick mack daddy
from the ice cube *

34:05.144 --> 34:08.180
* My body's quite muscular,
blood stream's corpuscular *

34:08.214 --> 34:11.650
* If you step to me, farkas,
you'll be sorry, sir *

34:11.750 --> 34:13.719
* Oh, yes *

34:13.752 --> 34:15.121
* You'll be sorry. *

34:15.221 --> 34:17.556
What?! What you got?!

34:19.225 --> 34:22.394
* I'm the Big Bad Wolf,
that's what I'm telling you *

34:22.428 --> 34:25.397
* I've got a sensitive nose,
that's why I'm smelling you *

34:25.431 --> 34:28.434
* I'll roofie your daughter,
hell, I'll roofie your son *

34:28.534 --> 34:30.736
* I'm faster than a gun,
so you can hide *

34:30.769 --> 34:34.206
* But you can't run. *

34:34.240 --> 34:36.608
(cheering, applause)

34:36.708 --> 34:38.310
* I'm an old-school warlock *

34:38.410 --> 34:40.379
* Slept in more bears' beds
than Goldilocks *

34:40.412 --> 34:43.115
* Stay away from my kid or
I'll beat you with my cock *

34:43.215 --> 34:45.417
* You may be an animal,
but I'm a magical mammal *

34:45.451 --> 34:48.154
* Who can turn you into ash and
then I'll go on sabbatical *

34:48.254 --> 34:50.822
* You got all of the id
and none of the ego *

34:50.922 --> 34:53.425
* You're all bark and no bite,
while I fly like an eagle. *

34:53.459 --> 34:57.062
* I'm the supine lupine,
my libido kills sunshine *

34:57.095 --> 34:59.565
* Moody and spicy like
a fine-ass toilet wine *

34:59.598 --> 35:02.100
* I'm the new norm,
like stepmother porn *

35:02.134 --> 35:04.770
* Like a snatch and grab
in a college dorm *

35:04.870 --> 35:06.605
* I'm everything that's real *

35:06.705 --> 35:09.475
* Like the fact that veal
is really adorable baby cows *

35:09.575 --> 35:12.444
* Who scream for their mommies
when they die *

35:12.478 --> 35:15.281
* Mm, screams. *

35:15.381 --> 35:17.249
(growls)

35:19.485 --> 35:22.288
* I'll take your reality
and I'll break it in half *

35:22.321 --> 35:24.790
* Then I'll go take a shower
or maybe a bath *

35:24.890 --> 35:27.793
* See, I'm classy, I'm elegant,
like a diplomat or a delegate *

35:27.893 --> 35:30.996
* I've got balls of an elephant,
by which I mean I'm masculine *

35:31.096 --> 35:33.332
* I've got a lot of nice
feminine qualities, too *

35:33.432 --> 35:35.467
* You could say I'm the mother
of disaster *

35:35.567 --> 35:37.869
* The battle master,
you call yourself a wolf? *

35:37.969 --> 35:39.571
* You're a shitty
little bastard. *

35:39.671 --> 35:41.973
* I'm the loco lobo,
and your name is meat *

35:42.007 --> 35:45.311
* Here is my lap,
come take a seat *

35:45.344 --> 35:48.480
* I've got a spiky erection,
like your daddy at bedtime *

35:48.514 --> 35:51.317
* Holding you tight and reading
"Once Upon a Hate Crime" *

35:51.417 --> 35:54.019
* I'm a hepatitis outbreak
in a homeless encampment *

35:54.119 --> 35:56.522
* I'm realer than real,
I only got bad news *

35:56.622 --> 36:00.659
* Now get out of my way
'cause I win and you lose. *

36:00.692 --> 36:03.028
(cheering, shouting)

36:10.336 --> 36:12.804
* You're a scared little boy
and you're crying boo-hoo *

36:12.838 --> 36:15.507
* Because you know deep inside
that nobody loves you *

36:15.607 --> 36:18.844
* I've got family and friends,
I give money to charity *

36:18.877 --> 36:20.346
* Every year on my birthday *

36:20.446 --> 36:22.113
* People send me cards
and letters *

36:22.214 --> 36:24.182
* My mom and dad
still write to me *

36:24.216 --> 36:26.184
* Little old ladies
still smile at me *

36:26.218 --> 36:27.986
* Puppies aren't afraid of me *

36:28.019 --> 36:29.655
* I get more hugs
than hate mail *

36:29.688 --> 36:31.423
* And I go to bed happy *

36:31.523 --> 36:36.161
* Can you say that,
you sad, sad man? *

36:38.163 --> 36:40.232
(cheering, applause,
indistinct chatter)

36:40.332 --> 36:43.869
(laughter)

36:43.902 --> 36:45.704
MAN:
Are you crying?

36:45.804 --> 36:48.139
-Stop.
-(applause and chatter stop)

36:50.108 --> 36:51.843
Don't kill him.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.181
(crying):
The bad man was mean to me.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.518
-I know, baby. It's okay.
-(crying)

36:59.551 --> 37:01.520
Thank you.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.890
For everything.

37:04.923 --> 37:08.294
But we belong together.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.561
(sniffling)

37:09.595 --> 37:11.730
It's okay.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.038
*

37:32.250 --> 37:34.052
I don't understand.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.756
She was my friend.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.760
Not everyone...

37:41.860 --> 37:43.895
wants to be saved.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.798
-Then why do we...
-You had to try

37:46.898 --> 37:49.100
so you'd know.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.576
Oh.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.911
(Melanie gasps)

37:59.945 --> 38:01.780
A-Are we...

38:04.616 --> 38:07.118
(laughing)

38:13.959 --> 38:16.294
I think she's ready.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.296
Ready for what?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.842
*

38:59.705 --> 39:02.641
Oh, my God.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.610
(Melanie chuckles softly)

39:06.445 --> 39:08.346
You see it now?

39:13.652 --> 39:15.854
I have to go back.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.689
MELANIE:
Remember, it's not

39:17.789 --> 39:20.426
"us or them."

39:20.526 --> 39:23.028
It's us and them.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.131
You're not coming?

39:29.868 --> 39:31.369
I need you.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.072
-OLIVER: We did our part.
-MELANIE: You can do this.

39:35.907 --> 39:39.478
Just remember everything
we taught you.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.053
*

40:03.935 --> 40:06.905
*

40:18.917 --> 40:21.086

40:32.798 --> 40:35.033

40:57.155 --> 40:59.390

41:15.574 --> 41:17.408
-(gasps)
-(deep whirring)

41:30.255 --> 41:32.624
-(Kerry whimpers)
-Ah-ah.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.660
Stop fighting.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.495
That's like me saying,
"Stop nerding."

41:40.031 --> 41:42.500
S-Stay still.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.207
Did we lose?

41:51.176 --> 41:53.178
Yes, I think so.

41:59.450 --> 42:02.153
So, does that mean we're just...

42:02.187 --> 42:05.557
going to vanish
when he changes things?

42:05.657 --> 42:08.193
Or...

42:08.226 --> 42:10.461
I don't know.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.231
SYD:
I can fix it.

42:13.331 --> 42:15.466
The time door's still open.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.335
I can fix it.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.640
But I need to get in there.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.009
Did you...

42:24.042 --> 42:26.678
change something about you?

42:26.712 --> 42:29.715
Other than that I just lived
an entire second life

42:29.815 --> 42:32.017
in the last 20 minutes?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.819
Maybe my hair.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.854
(Kerry grunts)

42:35.887 --> 42:37.723
Cary.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.390
The time door.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.360
Yes, David had a bracelet.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.596
-That you made.
-Yes.

42:44.696 --> 42:45.764
I'll make more.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.233
*

42:52.337 --> 42:55.073
Why is it doing that?

42:57.909 --> 43:00.746
-Cary?
-Yeah?

43:00.779 --> 43:03.248
Why is it doing that?

43:03.281 --> 43:06.151
I have a theory,
but you're not gonna like it.

43:09.354 --> 43:11.589
Okay, don't tell me.

43:13.458 --> 43:16.094
I think the Time Eaters
are back.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.796
I said don't tell me.

43:17.896 --> 43:19.530
Sorry.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.966
Uh...

43:21.066 --> 43:22.634
it's finished.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.304
And this will get us
into the hall?

43:26.404 --> 43:28.106
I've keyed it to her signal.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.108
The time traveler.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.379
We're piggybacking on her power.

43:37.415 --> 43:39.317
KERRY:
How are you gonna find them?

43:39.417 --> 43:42.453
The past is a big place.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.756
Same way.
Just follow her signal.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.135
Cary, she needs me.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.807
I know.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.942
I can't help like this.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.477
I know, but you'll need me, too.

44:06.577 --> 44:09.480
In case you need
to find your way back or...

44:09.580 --> 44:11.449
Oh.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.657
But you can do what you do
sitting down.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.463
I can't.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.172
What?

44:36.674 --> 44:38.343
We need a minute.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.350
*

45:12.978 --> 45:14.880
Ready?

45:18.183 --> 45:20.718
-M-Maybe there's another way.
-Kerry.

45:21.887 --> 45:23.922
It's the only way.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.396
Come home.

45:37.702 --> 45:40.738
(whimpers)
I'm so sorry.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.277

45:50.381 --> 45:53.618

46:10.068 --> 46:12.437
(faint, echoing laughter)

46:12.537 --> 46:15.807

46:15.907 --> 46:17.075
Cary?

46:17.108 --> 46:18.944
(gasping weakly)

46:21.379 --> 46:23.281
Kerry, it's time to go.

46:24.449 --> 46:27.085
(Time Eater snarling)

46:27.118 --> 46:28.386
Kerry?

46:29.955 --> 46:31.456
Go.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.393
*

46:35.493 --> 46:39.797

46:48.306 --> 46:50.308
No!

(Time Eater groans)

47:03.421 --> 47:06.591

We're gonna win.

47:35.686 --> 47:39.690

with a cinnamon girl *

47:39.790 --> 47:43.728

the rest of my life *

47:43.828 --> 47:47.032

your baby loves to dance *

48:03.915 --> 48:05.883

* Cinnamon girl. *
