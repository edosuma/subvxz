How you doing in there?
Is that my toothbrush?

00:13.508 --> 00:15.341
Yeah.

00:15.343 --> 00:17.143
What?

00:17.145 --> 00:18.645
We were making out all night.

00:18.647 --> 00:21.014
It's not your bodily fluids I'm
worried about, it's that, um...

00:21.016 --> 00:22.982
little green stuff on there.

00:22.984 --> 00:24.083
Is that spinach?

00:24.085 --> 00:26.786
No. Is it?

00:26.788 --> 00:30.089
I don't have spinach on my teeth.

00:30.091 --> 00:31.558
What the hell?

00:31.560 --> 00:33.793
I've already missed three calls
from my office.

00:33.795 --> 00:36.329
What time is it?

00:36.331 --> 00:38.131
Hey, it's Rachel.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.700
Is she all right?

00:40.702 --> 00:42.335
Should we send something,

00:42.337 --> 00:45.371
like flowers or merlot
or something like that?

00:45.373 --> 00:47.173
Yep, well, I will, um...

00:47.175 --> 00:49.042
I'll pick up the case files on my way in.

00:49.044 --> 00:51.377
Okay. Yeah, no, no. Don't worry about it.

00:51.379 --> 00:52.912
It will be fine.

00:52.914 --> 00:54.514
<i>Where</i> is it again?

00:56.317 --> 00:57.617
Great. Okay.

00:57.619 --> 00:59.152
Bye.

00:59.154 --> 01:01.054
Hey, uh... question?

01:01.056 --> 01:02.355
Hmm.

01:02.357 --> 01:04.924
What hospital do you work at again?

01:08.529 --> 01:10.797
Holy crap!

01:10.799 --> 01:14.334
I knew we were going through
changes, but I didn't think...

01:14.336 --> 01:15.802
They were gonna kill my E.R.?

01:15.804 --> 01:17.236
Well, they did.

01:17.238 --> 01:20.673
I'm just here to finish some
charts and clear out my locker.

01:20.675 --> 01:23.576
Why did I re-certify as a trauma
surgeon if we don't do trauma.

01:23.578 --> 01:24.978
You could transfer to General.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.546
Or join me and drive into the sunset

01:26.548 --> 01:28.147
straight off the unemployment cliff.

01:28.149 --> 01:29.549
You be Thelma, I'll be Louise.

01:29.551 --> 01:31.284
Where the hell is that pencil-pusher?

01:31.286 --> 01:33.052
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

01:33.054 --> 01:36.756
Bathroom?! Quick!

01:36.758 --> 01:39.892
If he falls and impales himself
on a toilet brush, call me.

01:39.894 --> 01:42.595
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:42.597 --> 01:45.431
What would you call my greatest assets?

01:45.433 --> 01:48.601
Is that a trick question?
You're transferring?

01:48.603 --> 01:51.437
Like rats leaving a sinking ship.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.541
Hey, uh, do you have a pen? Mine's dry.

01:55.543 --> 01:57.143
What the hell, I don't need it anymore.

01:57.145 --> 01:58.778
- Speaking of rats.
- Look.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.313
Look around, ladies and gentlemen,

02:00.315 --> 02:01.948
a glimpse of this hospital's future.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.416
You see, I believe in Hope Zion.

02:03.418 --> 02:07.320
In fact, I've seen its ability
to produce talent firsthand.

02:07.322 --> 02:09.422
Talent like Dr. Williams here.

02:09.424 --> 02:10.957
Cassie, come over here.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.159
Another sign of the future.

02:13.161 --> 02:16.262
And my choice
for chief surgical resident.

02:16.264 --> 02:18.264
Are you serious?

02:18.266 --> 02:20.133
Thomas, thank you!

02:20.135 --> 02:22.435
He can't do that. Can he do that?

02:22.437 --> 02:24.137
No. But he just did.

02:24.139 --> 02:25.638
Excuse me, Miss.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.407
[coughing]

02:27.409 --> 02:29.108
- There's something wrong with my chest.
- Yeah.

02:29.110 --> 02:30.977
- Are you dizzy?
- Yeah, we're...

02:30.979 --> 02:33.379
we're still transitioning, so
forgive us for a few hiccups.

02:33.381 --> 02:36.182
Sir, I'm sorry, but this isn't
an emergency room.

02:36.184 --> 02:37.583
I can call you an ambulance.

02:37.585 --> 02:39.419
Is it hospital?

02:39.421 --> 02:41.654
We don't have the proper systems
in place to deal

02:41.656 --> 02:43.322
with a, yeah, a cardiac situation.

02:43.324 --> 02:44.891
The General is your best bet.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.293
Oh, my God.

02:47.295 --> 02:48.561
[chuckles lamely]

02:48.563 --> 02:51.564
Sorry. Where... where were we?

02:51.566 --> 02:53.232
She keeps putting up this front

02:53.234 --> 02:55.334
like she can handle anything in the world.

02:55.336 --> 02:57.203
But I know her and she's scared.

02:57.205 --> 02:58.771
I just with there was something I could do.

02:58.773 --> 03:00.006
It's your mom. Of course you do.

03:00.008 --> 03:01.574
Maybe it's not as bad as you think, though.

03:01.576 --> 03:02.608
No, Shahir's not known

03:02.610 --> 03:04.343
for making mountains out of molehills.

03:04.345 --> 03:05.845
Plus, today of all days,

03:05.847 --> 03:09.048
Maggie and I get to try to keep
our medical licenses.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.950
It is crazy.

03:10.952 --> 03:12.185
Your life is crazy.

03:12.187 --> 03:13.619
It is.

03:13.621 --> 03:15.298
You could use something
to look forward to.

03:15.298 --> 03:16.021
Oh, yeah?

03:16.024 --> 03:18.825
Yeah, something to take your mind
off things while the dust settles.

03:18.827 --> 03:21.027
- Mini-Putt.
- Mini-Putt.

03:21.029 --> 03:22.628
Played a round the other night.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.363
The course is pretty immaculate.

03:24.365 --> 03:26.365
Dr. Palmer, are you asking me on a date?

03:26.367 --> 03:29.469
No, no, I just... I just want
to work on my short game.

03:29.471 --> 03:31.471
[chuckles]
Okay, well, you know I'm gonna crush you.

03:31.473 --> 03:32.605
I appreciate your confidence,

03:32.607 --> 03:33.740
but we'll see how it holds up

03:33.742 --> 03:34.974
to the windmill on the 12th hole.

03:34.976 --> 03:36.476
Okay.

03:36.478 --> 03:37.910
Meet in my office after work?

03:37.912 --> 03:39.045
It's a date. Alex.

03:39.047 --> 03:40.146
Hmm?

03:40.148 --> 03:43.850
Look, you saved her life.

03:43.852 --> 03:45.885
Don't let anyone tell you different, okay?

03:45.887 --> 03:48.387
Thank you.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.765 --> 03:59.165
Maggie.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.700
Is she up?

04:00.702 --> 04:01.934
No.

04:01.936 --> 04:04.570
No changes in Bree's condition.

04:04.572 --> 04:06.405
You should get yourself cleaned up.

04:06.407 --> 04:08.207
The lawyers are gonna be here soon.

04:08.209 --> 04:10.309
I thought if I went through all this stuff,

04:10.311 --> 04:12.478
that I could figure out a way
to wake her up.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.747
Is this my fault, Alex?

04:14.749 --> 04:16.582
What if the blood thinners I gave...

04:16.584 --> 04:18.651
Blood thinners didn't put her into a coma.

04:18.653 --> 04:20.052
We know how this works.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.455
The body needs to heal in its own time.

04:22.457 --> 04:24.090
And now the lawyers are coming.

04:24.092 --> 04:26.793
Well, regardless of what
happens, we did the right thing.

04:28.762 --> 04:30.229
Now, I need to take care of something.

04:30.231 --> 04:31.864
Just stay strong.

04:31.866 --> 04:33.933
- She'll wake up.
- Okay.

04:41.441 --> 04:44.544
It's Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

04:44.546 --> 04:47.113
Its symptoms mirror aggressive dementia.

04:47.115 --> 04:48.981
It's rare, but...

04:48.983 --> 04:52.084
I triple-checked the test results.

04:52.086 --> 04:55.221
How long does she have?

04:55.223 --> 04:57.356
Well, she's already experiencing
some cognitive decline,

04:57.358 --> 04:59.292
and once symptoms show,
it's rapidly progressive.

04:59.294 --> 05:00.526
How long?

05:00.528 --> 05:03.262
She'll be on a vent in four to five months.

05:03.693 --> 05:06.766
But, Alex, by then, the woman
you know will be gone.

05:09.903 --> 05:11.904
Well, there has to be something.

05:11.906 --> 05:13.639
There isn't.

05:15.211 --> 05:16.442
Right.

05:16.444 --> 05:19.212
I'll have to tell her as soon as possible.

05:19.214 --> 05:21.914
- I want to be there.
- No.

05:21.916 --> 05:25.551
- No, Alex.
- This disease is too confusing.

05:25.553 --> 05:27.153
And... and her last outburst

05:27.155 --> 05:29.255
was caused by stress over upsetting you.

05:29.257 --> 05:32.124
She needs space,

05:32.126 --> 05:35.394
time to process.

05:35.396 --> 05:39.298
[voice breaking] She's my mother, Shahir.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.234
I know.

05:43.704 --> 05:45.504
I'm sorry.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.245
Dr. Harris, nice to see you again.

05:52.247 --> 05:54.347
Just wish it was under
different circumstances.

05:54.349 --> 05:56.015
You don't know the half of it.

05:58.051 --> 05:59.819
Eric Hawes, counsel for Hope Zion.

05:59.821 --> 06:00.987
Rachel Carter.

06:00.989 --> 06:02.755
My colleague had a family emergency,

06:02.757 --> 06:03.923
so I will be representing

06:03.925 --> 06:05.892
the medical licensing body on her behalf.

06:07.661 --> 06:09.095
Dr. Harris.

06:09.097 --> 06:11.130
Miss Carter.

06:11.132 --> 06:14.267
Number 48.

06:14.269 --> 06:16.335
I guess my number's finally up.

06:16.337 --> 06:19.338
I wasn't sure if I was getting
out of this place.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.940
Right this way.

06:20.942 --> 06:23.776
You know, some people are
actually being sent away.

06:23.778 --> 06:26.245
I wish that wasn't the truth. Have a seat.

06:26.247 --> 06:28.948
Yeah, I saw one of your guys
tell this poor man

06:28.950 --> 06:30.683
that he'd call an ambulance for him.

06:30.685 --> 06:32.084
- Hmm.
- [chuckles]

06:32.086 --> 06:34.620
Calling an ambulance to a hospital.

06:34.622 --> 06:36.289
He is not one of our guys.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.024
Please, get comfortable.

06:38.026 --> 06:41.560
Well, if I don't let my feet
breathe, they sweat.

06:41.562 --> 06:43.863
Which will bother my wife when I get home

06:43.865 --> 06:45.164
and I take off my shoes.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.366
If she's bothered, everyone's bothered.

06:47.368 --> 06:49.068
Well, you can't have that.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.203
I cannot.

06:51.205 --> 06:52.738
I'm Eli King.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.106
Zach Miller.

06:54.108 --> 06:56.876
[Thomas speaking indistinctly]

06:56.878 --> 06:59.011
Is there someplace you'd rather be, Zach?

06:59.013 --> 07:02.448
I'm sorry.
I... it's my last day at work.

07:02.450 --> 07:04.116
There have been a few changes around here

07:04.118 --> 07:05.885
that I don't agree with.

07:05.887 --> 07:07.153
The guy in the suit?

07:07.155 --> 07:08.387
Mm.

07:08.389 --> 07:12.058
Yeah, well, I'm just a guy with sweaty feet.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.927
Even I can tell that that man's
head is so far up his ass,

07:14.929 --> 07:17.263
he can't see what's obvious
to everyone else.

07:17.265 --> 07:18.397
And what's that?

07:18.399 --> 07:20.466
That this place ran a whole lot smoother

07:20.468 --> 07:22.435
when it was an actual emergency room.

07:22.437 --> 07:23.903
[chuckles]

07:23.905 --> 07:27.139
Let's focus on you, shall we?

07:27.141 --> 07:30.009
What brought you in today,
other than the hyperhidrosis,

07:30.011 --> 07:31.344
which is a real condition, by the way,

07:31.346 --> 07:32.378
if she gives you hell again.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.146
Hmm. I like that.

07:34.148 --> 07:36.983
But... I think I'm okay.

07:36.985 --> 07:39.285
I just woke up feeling a little...

07:39.287 --> 07:40.519
off.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.621
Okay, well, why don't...

07:42.623 --> 07:44.790
Sekara.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.225
I gotta go get a pen.

07:46.227 --> 07:48.394
You sit back, relax, put your feet up, okay?

07:49.563 --> 07:51.130
Dev.

07:51.132 --> 07:52.531
Dev, I need my pen.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.066
[tires screeching]

07:54.068 --> 07:56.369
[crashing, glass shatters]

07:56.371 --> 07:58.938
[horn honking, alarm wailing]

08:05.912 --> 08:07.413
Oh...

08:07.415 --> 08:08.948
You okay?

08:08.950 --> 08:10.950
[groaning]

08:10.952 --> 08:14.086
[man screaming]

08:14.088 --> 08:17.056
[honking and wailing continue]

08:25.214 --> 08:26.927
[groaning]

08:26.929 --> 08:28.729
We're gonna take you to
an operating room, okay?

08:28.731 --> 08:30.231
Man: I can't freakin' move!

08:30.233 --> 08:31.866
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to calm down, Martin.

08:31.868 --> 08:33.200
Look at me, look at me. I need you to relax.

08:33.202 --> 08:34.201
Stay still, look at me.

08:34.203 --> 08:36.504
Deep breath in and out.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.304
There you go. Breathe in and out.

08:38.307 --> 08:40.140
- There you go, that's great.
- Ohh!

08:40.143 --> 08:41.475
Oh, dude, what the hell are you doing?!

08:41.477 --> 08:43.210
You can feel that...
that's good. That's good.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.712
That means your spine is okay,

08:44.714 --> 08:47.214
and that means that you are
getting oxygen to your brain.

08:47.216 --> 08:49.216
My brain? Why?
What's wrong with my brain?

08:49.218 --> 08:50.951
There's nothing wrong with your
brain. You just keep talking.

08:50.953 --> 08:53.387
Yes, I know... I know ambulance
service has been suspended here.

08:53.389 --> 08:55.322
It's not a drop off!
I need someone picked up!

08:55.324 --> 08:57.424
- [moans]
- How we doing? Keep talking.

08:57.426 --> 08:59.059
Oh, I got a freakin' car pinned to me, man.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.327
How do you think I'm doing?

09:00.329 --> 09:02.429
That's good, that's good, that's good.

09:02.431 --> 09:03.898
Martin, I'm Dr. Bell.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.800
I'm gonna take your pulse, see
how your heart's doing, okay?

09:05.802 --> 09:07.001
Just... just send them!

09:07.003 --> 09:08.435
Who? Everyone!

09:08.437 --> 09:10.037
We need to get these people out of here.

09:10.039 --> 09:12.173
- I could use a hand over here.
- Okay.

09:12.175 --> 09:14.241
O-Okay, everybody back up, please!

09:14.243 --> 09:16.277
Please! Let's let these doctors work.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.612
Okay, he's bleeding from his abdomen.

09:18.614 --> 09:19.847
Okay.

09:19.849 --> 09:22.917
- Pushing morphine.
- [moans]

09:22.919 --> 09:25.519
Okay. Martin?

09:25.521 --> 09:26.854
This isn't gonna feel the greatest.

09:26.856 --> 09:29.190
[screams]

09:29.192 --> 09:31.625
Okay, when we move him,
we're gonna need to be ready,

09:31.627 --> 09:33.294
'cause I don't know what we're
dealing with under here.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.296
Okay, capillary refill is normal
on the right,

09:35.298 --> 09:36.564
but it's weak on the left.

09:36.566 --> 09:39.033
Martin, how's... how's your back?
Do you have any pain?

09:39.035 --> 09:42.603
My... my back... oh,
it's freakin' roaring, man.

09:42.605 --> 09:43.838
Okay, it could be aortic dissection.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.706
- We can't wait any longer.
- Right. Okay.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.374
Martin, we're gonna be right back, okay?

09:47.376 --> 09:49.176
Yeah. Yeah.

09:49.178 --> 09:50.778
- Cassie, keep talking to him.
- Yeah.

09:50.780 --> 09:51.946
You're just gonna leave us here?

09:51.948 --> 09:53.848
We don't have a choice. Tie his legs!

09:53.850 --> 09:56.016
- Thomas!
- Okay, guys, I need you to move over here.

09:56.018 --> 09:58.586
- I'll prep an O.R.
- Come on, let's get moving!

09:58.588 --> 10:00.921
All right, back up, folks.
Come on. Back it up.

10:00.923 --> 10:03.824
Jackson, I need bicarb calcium,
insulin, glucose.

10:03.826 --> 10:05.559
Should be right there. Well, it's not.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.895
Where are the drugs?

10:07.897 --> 10:09.430
God damn it! [clatter]

10:09.432 --> 10:12.299
- Okay.
- There's calcium on the ward.

10:12.301 --> 10:13.934
I'll go raid the lab. Meet me back here.

10:13.936 --> 10:15.703
Got it.

10:15.705 --> 10:18.472
Okay, how you doing, Martin?

10:18.474 --> 10:20.007
I'm not gonna lie...

10:20.009 --> 10:22.042
I'm getting a little sick of that question.

10:22.044 --> 10:23.210
I get that, I get that.

10:23.212 --> 10:24.311
Thomas, I need you to hold this still.

10:24.313 --> 10:25.579
Wait, wait. You want me to...

10:25.581 --> 10:27.381
Just local pressure, okay?

10:27.383 --> 10:28.682
Dev took the driver up to imaging,

10:28.684 --> 10:30.050
and the rest of the staff is flooded.

10:30.052 --> 10:31.452
So right now, you're all I have.

10:31.454 --> 10:32.753
Okay.

10:32.755 --> 10:34.855
[screams]

10:34.857 --> 10:38.092
- Hold it!
- [grunts]

10:38.094 --> 10:41.729
We're here today for a preliminary inquiry

10:41.731 --> 10:44.632
into the case of Bree Hannigan.

10:44.634 --> 10:47.401
Violet Jackson, Miss Hannigan's
common-law partner,

10:47.403 --> 10:50.371
has lodged a serious complaint
with the licensing body.

10:50.373 --> 10:53.407
Bree was enrolled in a cancer
study here at Hope Zion,

10:53.409 --> 10:54.808
and now she's in a coma.

10:54.810 --> 10:56.010
We want to know why.

10:56.012 --> 10:59.046
Well, our doctors were
administering gene therapy

10:59.048 --> 11:00.414
as well as chemotherapy

11:00.416 --> 11:02.850
to help fight her Stage 4 breast cancer.

11:02.852 --> 11:05.619
- Until she developed a bowel obstruction.
- Yes.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.655
Dr. Reid and Dr. Lin
presented me with options

11:07.657 --> 11:09.757
to help relieve the obstruction.

11:09.759 --> 11:12.359
I trusted their judgment
and gave them my blessing.

11:12.361 --> 11:14.094
And you felt confident in that decision?

11:14.096 --> 11:15.763
Yes.

11:15.765 --> 11:17.498
Even though you're an orthopedic surgeon

11:17.500 --> 11:20.371
and you'd only been named
interim chief that day?

11:22.156 --> 11:24.204
I was chief before for three years.

11:24.206 --> 11:25.372
What happened?

11:25.374 --> 11:27.775
I got into a car accident.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.766
And I was in a coma.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.983
- Oh.
- That seems to be going around.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.370
And when I got out of the coma,

11:38.370 --> 11:39.765
I wanted to focus on other things.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.454
Like what?

11:40.456 --> 11:43.958
Uh, like my life, like my fiancée.

11:47.362 --> 11:48.562
[whispering indistinctly]

11:53.268 --> 11:55.803
I was engaged to Dr. Reid.

11:55.805 --> 11:56.904
<i>Was.</i>

11:58.773 --> 12:01.113
Well, that changes things, doesn't it?

12:01.521 --> 12:02.388
How?

12:02.388 --> 12:03.146
Will you excuse me?

12:03.146 --> 12:05.260
I'd like to request a five-minute recess.

12:09.351 --> 12:11.785
[Martin chuckles]

12:12.574 --> 12:14.421
I was gonna call in sick today.

12:14.423 --> 12:15.956
Cassie: You should conserve your energy.

12:15.958 --> 12:19.526
I just came in to visit my drummer.

12:19.528 --> 12:21.228
Martin, please.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.130
Rocko.

12:23.386 --> 12:26.433
He was drumming so hard...

12:26.435 --> 12:30.838
that the stick broke off into his eyeball.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.439
- Ugh!
- [chuckles]

12:32.441 --> 12:34.975
Martin: Yeah.

12:34.977 --> 12:38.879
That was the most metal thing I ever saw.

12:38.881 --> 12:41.682
Except I think I got him beat this time.

12:41.684 --> 12:44.618
Because this... this...

12:44.620 --> 12:47.988
this is <i>brutal.</i>

12:47.990 --> 12:51.692
[chuckling weakly]

12:51.694 --> 12:54.795
I should call my mom.

12:54.797 --> 12:57.131
Yeah. Yeah, we can do that.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.568
[voice breaking] She's pissed at me.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.771
She got me this job at my uncle's shop,

13:03.773 --> 13:05.939
and I keep flaking.

13:05.941 --> 13:09.476
I'm trying to do this music thing, you know?

13:11.445 --> 13:13.577
Can you get my phone?

13:13.577 --> 13:14.508
Yeah.

13:14.508 --> 13:16.650
- Thomas?
- Oh, uh, um...

13:17.152 --> 13:18.919
Martin: It's in my left pocket, man.

13:22.423 --> 13:25.025
[sniffles] Can you dial?

13:25.027 --> 13:26.826
[cellphone drops] Thomas?

13:26.828 --> 13:28.161
Focus.

13:28.163 --> 13:29.529
Okay?

13:29.531 --> 13:30.764
It's in my contacts.

13:30.766 --> 13:34.634
It's under "Mom." [chuckles]

13:38.105 --> 13:40.507
Uh, okay, okay, it's ringing.

13:44.845 --> 13:47.480
Mom. Mom?

13:49.050 --> 13:51.585
No, I'm not at work.

13:51.587 --> 13:53.353
Mom.

13:53.355 --> 13:55.989
Just listen.

13:55.991 --> 13:58.024
[crying] I just wanted you to know

13:58.026 --> 14:00.427
that I know that I'm a screw-up, okay?

14:00.429 --> 14:01.995
[sobbing]

14:01.997 --> 14:03.997
But...

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
But I love you.

14:07.702 --> 14:09.603
Martin. Martin?

14:11.339 --> 14:13.173
H-Hello, Miss?

14:13.175 --> 14:14.841
No, no, there's been an accident.

14:14.843 --> 14:16.076
Your son is at Hope Zion.

14:16.078 --> 14:17.744
I need help over here!

14:17.746 --> 14:19.279
Okay, no... no, no, no, no, no.

14:19.281 --> 14:20.880
He's gonna be fine. We're gonna save him.

14:22.283 --> 14:24.184
Look, I-I have to go.

14:24.186 --> 14:25.885
You should just... just...
just... you should come.

14:25.887 --> 14:28.288
Why did you tell her that?

14:28.290 --> 14:29.856
You shouldn't say that.

14:32.126 --> 14:34.527
Alex and I are separated, okay?
We're not together.

14:34.529 --> 14:36.062
We weren't together.

14:36.064 --> 14:38.398
But you and me...

14:38.400 --> 14:40.066
that could be a huge conflict of interest.

14:40.068 --> 14:41.568
Maybe you should pass this case off.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.370
No.

14:43.372 --> 14:46.106
It's not a conflict of interest for me.

14:46.108 --> 14:47.941
I'm very good at my job.

14:51.779 --> 14:53.747
Is that her?

14:53.749 --> 14:54.981
Is that the lawyer?

14:54.983 --> 14:57.283
Unfortunately, yes.

14:57.285 --> 15:00.186
Don't worry, Maggie, just tell
the truth, you'll be fine.

15:00.188 --> 15:02.656
If anything changes with Bree...

15:02.658 --> 15:04.357
- They'll page us.
- Thanks.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.429
Maggie?

15:14.168 --> 15:16.102
No, you're not dead, you're in a coma.

15:16.104 --> 15:18.872
No, you can't touch anything,
and, yes, I can see you.

15:18.874 --> 15:19.939
Okay?

15:19.941 --> 15:21.474
Okay.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.078
If I'm the one who's in a coma,

15:25.080 --> 15:26.913
why did Maggie look so worried?

15:26.915 --> 15:28.348
There's an investigation.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.917
Your, um, girlfriend has asked
the medical licensing board

15:30.919 --> 15:31.951
to review your case.

15:31.953 --> 15:34.220
She can't do that.

15:34.222 --> 15:35.822
No. [chuckles]

15:35.824 --> 15:39.526
Maggie has been my only support
through all of this.

15:39.528 --> 15:42.295
I-I can't let Violet blame her.

15:42.297 --> 15:45.365
Okay. Then wake up.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.667
'Cause all this goes away if you wake up.

15:48.169 --> 15:51.871
Okay. How do I do that?

15:51.873 --> 15:54.541
We need to move him.

15:54.543 --> 15:56.209
- What? No!
- We wait for the ambulances.

15:56.211 --> 15:57.577
They should be here any minute.

15:57.579 --> 15:59.179
He doesn't have time.

15:59.181 --> 16:00.980
Zach, without the E.R., we might
not be able to save him.

16:00.982 --> 16:03.316
- Jackson!
- Yeah!

16:03.318 --> 16:05.652
Get in the car, put it in
neutral, and wait for my word.

16:05.654 --> 16:07.554
Jody! Jody, get a stretcher ready!

16:07.556 --> 16:09.589
No, no! They're coming! Help is coming!

16:09.591 --> 16:11.357
Cassie, come down here and feel his pulse

16:11.359 --> 16:13.393
and tell me what you think.

16:13.395 --> 16:15.562
It's faint. He doesn't have enough time.

16:15.564 --> 16:17.263
So switch with me.
I want you to come down here.

16:17.265 --> 16:18.349
We're gonna push this car off him.

16:18.349 --> 16:19.387
The second we get it off,

16:19.387 --> 16:21.608
we're gonna be dealing with
a ticking time bomb, all right?

16:21.608 --> 16:23.603
But right now, this is our only option.

16:23.605 --> 16:25.605
We move fast, we move smart,
and we save his life.

16:25.607 --> 16:26.773
- You got it?
- Yeah.

16:26.775 --> 16:28.141
On three. You ready?

16:28.143 --> 16:29.609
One... Stand up!

16:29.611 --> 16:33.413
One, two, three... push! Push!

16:33.415 --> 16:35.248
[grunting]

16:35.250 --> 16:37.217
[screams]

16:39.723 --> 16:41.785
He's not getting any air.

16:41.787 --> 16:43.187
Let's get some pressure on him.

16:43.189 --> 16:44.730
Let's get that tube
in his left side right now.

16:44.730 --> 16:46.005
- Yeah.
- Let's stop here.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.291
Stop, stop, stop!

16:48.435 --> 16:49.893
Hey, doc, I could use a hand.

16:49.895 --> 16:51.094
I'm not feeling so...

16:51.096 --> 16:53.030
Okay, somebody help him!
We need help over here.

16:53.032 --> 16:55.199
- Okay, tube's in. Let's go!
- Go, push, let's go!

16:55.201 --> 16:56.934
- Uh, crap, it's...
- Okay, okay.

16:56.936 --> 16:58.769
What... okay, where are your shoes?

16:58.771 --> 17:00.237
[groans]

17:00.239 --> 17:03.106
Is that... have you been drinking?

17:03.108 --> 17:05.509
No, I feel kind of woozy but...

17:05.511 --> 17:07.544
But... but... but what, you're a drunk?

17:07.546 --> 17:09.480
I'm sorry, my levels are...

17:09.482 --> 17:11.949
But there are other things,
bigger things happening.

17:11.951 --> 17:14.351
A car just... Don't you get that?

17:14.353 --> 17:15.886
Look, just sleep it off.

17:15.887 --> 17:16.887
[curtain rattles]

17:18.490 --> 17:21.023
I just need a minute, Anna.

17:21.026 --> 17:22.192
Hey, buddy.

17:22.194 --> 17:24.027
[whispering] Hi, Mom. How are you?

17:24.029 --> 17:26.262
Why are you whispering?

17:26.265 --> 17:27.698
[device beeps]

17:27.700 --> 17:29.466
Oh, she won't wake up.

17:29.468 --> 17:30.434
Watch.

17:30.436 --> 17:32.069
Hey, Eunice!

17:32.071 --> 17:33.637
[snores loudly]

17:33.639 --> 17:34.872
Mom, keep it down.

17:34.874 --> 17:36.240
She had thyroid surgery.

17:36.242 --> 17:38.575
Been out like Sleeping Beauty
[chuckling] ever since.

17:38.577 --> 17:40.811
Not that it does <i>me</i> much good,

17:40.813 --> 17:42.212
what with that chainsaw in her mouth.

17:42.214 --> 17:42.918
[chuckles]

17:42.918 --> 17:44.781
How you doing, buddy, huh?

17:44.783 --> 17:47.117
I had to see him. I hope you don't mind.

17:47.119 --> 17:49.653
No, that's fine. It's fine.

17:52.223 --> 17:55.659
Mom, I need to talk to you about something.

17:55.661 --> 17:58.028
Did Shahir explain what's going on?

17:58.030 --> 17:59.830
♪ This is the way ♪
♪ the horsey goes ♪

17:59.832 --> 18:02.232
♪ Ba-dump, ba-dump ♪

18:02.234 --> 18:04.835
Mom, did Shahir talk to you
about what's happening?

18:04.837 --> 18:06.236
Look at this face.

18:06.238 --> 18:08.338
I just could eat this little face.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.307
Mom, did you talk to Shahir?

18:10.309 --> 18:14.278
Alex, I know I wasn't the best mom.

18:14.280 --> 18:18.048
But maybe now that we have all this time,

18:18.050 --> 18:19.783
the way to make up for it

18:19.785 --> 18:23.887
is just to be the best damn
grandma that Luke ever had.

18:23.889 --> 18:26.223
Oh, crap, I said "Damn."

18:26.225 --> 18:28.392
[chuckling] Oh, I'm sorry, pickle.

18:28.394 --> 18:30.561
I just...

18:30.563 --> 18:32.462
I just wanted to say that I'm grateful

18:32.464 --> 18:34.031
to be back in your lives.

18:36.267 --> 18:39.369
You look so serious. What's wrong?

18:39.371 --> 18:42.639
It's nothing. I just need
to talk to your doctor.

18:42.641 --> 18:44.908
I'll be back, okay?

18:44.910 --> 18:46.310
I'll see you soon, okay?

18:46.312 --> 18:47.010
Bye.

18:47.012 --> 18:48.278
Bye.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.581
Say, "In a while, crocodile."

18:50.583 --> 18:52.749
In a while, crocodile.

18:52.751 --> 18:53.951
Crocodile.

18:53.953 --> 18:54.985
Crocodile.

18:56.621 --> 18:58.956
What the hell, Shahir?

18:58.958 --> 19:00.557
Can you be more specific?

19:00.559 --> 19:02.960
You were supposed to tell my mother.

19:02.962 --> 19:04.361
Oh, yes.

19:04.363 --> 19:05.696
I explained to her the condition,

19:05.698 --> 19:06.730
gave her the prognosis.

19:06.732 --> 19:07.898
Why, what happened?

19:07.900 --> 19:09.166
Nothing happened.

19:09.168 --> 19:10.500
She was just sitting there with Luke

19:10.502 --> 19:11.401
like nothing had changed.

19:11.403 --> 19:14.905
But I told her, Alex.

19:14.907 --> 19:17.608
I was thorough, concise.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.743
Do you think she didn't retain it?

19:19.745 --> 19:20.944
Well, if that's true,

19:20.946 --> 19:23.080
then her cognition must be
declining rapidly.

19:23.082 --> 19:26.483
The disease must be progressing
faster than I thought.

19:26.485 --> 19:30.387
So [clears throat]...
So, what do we do next?

19:30.389 --> 19:32.222
Well, I have to tell her again.

19:32.224 --> 19:33.523
No, I...

19:33.525 --> 19:35.025
I will.

19:35.027 --> 19:37.761
Shahir, please...

19:37.763 --> 19:40.330
it should be me.

19:40.332 --> 19:44.234
Your work has been questioned before, yes?

19:44.236 --> 19:46.737
Litigation over a pledget...

19:46.739 --> 19:48.572
left in a patient after surgery.

19:48.574 --> 19:50.440
That allegation was proven false.

19:50.442 --> 19:51.575
So what's that saying?

19:51.577 --> 19:53.410
Once is an incident, twice is a pattern.

19:53.412 --> 19:54.978
Not when one was disproven.

19:54.980 --> 19:58.115
Violet, I know you want answers.

19:58.117 --> 19:59.349
You said you'd take care of her.

19:59.351 --> 20:01.485
So what, that gave you
the right to abandon her?

20:02.420 --> 20:06.657
Dr. Lin, your contact with the
patient was 100% professional?

20:06.659 --> 20:11.695
Because I see three separate
requests for funding

20:11.697 --> 20:13.463
for accommodation that were all denied,

20:13.465 --> 20:15.799
and yet several of the other trial patients

20:15.801 --> 20:18.168
said that Bree did, in fact, stay overnight.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.970
It was just one night.

20:19.972 --> 20:21.738
Bree was very sick.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.375
After her treatment,
we had no beds available, so...

20:25.377 --> 20:27.811
I made arrangements for her
to stay in the call room.

20:27.813 --> 20:29.379
You had a sleep-over with her?

20:29.381 --> 20:31.448
Not <i>with</i> her, <i>for</i> her.

20:31.450 --> 20:34.551
Well, that's new.

20:34.553 --> 20:36.720
So I'll ask you again, Dr. Lin,

20:36.722 --> 20:39.656
was your relationship with the
patient purely professional?

20:39.658 --> 20:41.625
I'd like to request another recess.

20:41.627 --> 20:43.660
- We can't do that.
- I can.

20:43.662 --> 20:45.729
Five minutes, please.

20:45.731 --> 20:47.464
I may have gone above and beyond,

20:47.466 --> 20:48.899
but I didn't cross any lines.

20:48.901 --> 20:50.434
You should have disclosed this to me.

20:50.436 --> 20:52.202
Okay, I think she's gotten us
off topic here.

20:52.204 --> 20:54.471
The issue is whether or not
Dr. Reid and Dr. Lin

20:54.473 --> 20:55.672
were medically negligent.

20:55.674 --> 20:57.307
Let's stick to that.

20:57.309 --> 20:58.608
Fine.

20:58.610 --> 21:01.178
But my primary interest here
is in protecting the hospital,

21:01.180 --> 21:02.379
not your medical licenses.

21:02.381 --> 21:04.414
If I don't have the whole picture,

21:04.416 --> 21:05.549
you're on your own.

21:05.551 --> 21:06.550
Fine.

21:08.586 --> 21:10.620
Don't worry, Maggie, just...

21:10.622 --> 21:11.822
focus on the medicine.

21:11.824 --> 21:14.224
Yeah, there's a problem there.

21:14.226 --> 21:16.126
When you signed off on the surgery,

21:16.128 --> 21:18.261
you didn't have the full picture, either.

21:18.263 --> 21:19.896
What are you talking about?

21:19.898 --> 21:22.799
Alex told you that we reversed
Bree's blood thinners.

21:22.801 --> 21:24.334
- Mm-hmm.
- But we didn't.

21:24.336 --> 21:26.737
Alex lied about the blood work?

21:26.739 --> 21:28.505
She was going septic.

21:28.507 --> 21:30.240
Alex knew you wouldn't okay
a surgery if you knew...

21:30.242 --> 21:32.042
So she lied about the blood work?

21:32.044 --> 21:34.044
She's not in a coma because
of the blood thinners.

21:34.046 --> 21:36.179
That doesn't matter, Maggie.

21:36.181 --> 21:38.181
'Cause if she doesn't wake up...

21:38.183 --> 21:39.950
you and Alex...

21:39.952 --> 21:42.719
you're finished here.

21:46.714 --> 21:47.843
[tone over intercom]

21:47.843 --> 21:50.255
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

21:50.255 --> 21:51.941
[tone repeats]

21:53.386 --> 21:55.152
We need to talk.

21:57.088 --> 21:59.590
In a second, darling.

22:12.204 --> 22:13.571
Mom...

22:13.573 --> 22:15.306
you're sick.

22:15.308 --> 22:18.542
Shahir tried to explain it to you,

22:18.544 --> 22:20.544
but your memory has been compromised

22:20.546 --> 22:21.712
because of a disease.

22:21.714 --> 22:23.314
Yes.

22:23.316 --> 22:25.683
Sounds like a furniture designer.

22:25.685 --> 22:27.151
[sophisticated voice] And over here,

22:27.153 --> 22:30.921
we have the Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

22:30.923 --> 22:34.024
[normal voice] Lovely bed, to be sure.

22:34.026 --> 22:36.494
So you do know.

22:36.496 --> 22:39.230
Yes.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.565
What am I supposed to do about it?

22:43.201 --> 22:45.669
Why don't you talk to me about it?

22:45.671 --> 22:48.672
I mean, what do you think?
What do you want to do?

22:50.842 --> 22:53.110
I want to see Luke.

22:53.112 --> 22:55.546
I know, but I think we should
talk about this fo...

22:55.548 --> 22:57.581
I said I want to see my son.

23:04.489 --> 23:06.624
Luke is <i>my</i> son.

23:06.626 --> 23:11.161
I named him after Luke, my brother.

23:11.163 --> 23:13.898
He was your youngest son, but...

23:13.900 --> 23:15.699
he's gone now, Mom.

23:15.701 --> 23:17.868
H-He's gone.

23:17.870 --> 23:19.904
I know that.

23:19.906 --> 23:22.339
You don't think I know that?

23:22.341 --> 23:24.475
I'm just saying, I'm...

23:26.645 --> 23:28.646
I'll be seeing him soon.

23:33.218 --> 23:35.819
I'd like to be alone now.

23:35.821 --> 23:38.923
- Mom, I...
- Just go, Alex.

23:40.191 --> 23:41.325
Go.

23:44.296 --> 23:45.963
Of course.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.968
[monitor beeping rhythmically]

23:53.905 --> 23:55.606
How's Martin doing?

23:55.608 --> 23:57.775
Dana: Imaging confirmed an aortic dissection

23:57.777 --> 23:59.577
just past the left
subclavian artery takeoff.

23:59.579 --> 24:01.478
I got a couple cracked ribs here.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.613
This guy's pierced a lung.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.682
When we close, we'll get a tube in there,

24:04.684 --> 24:05.783
wire up those ribs.

24:05.785 --> 24:07.618
I'm not concerned about them right now.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.852
The break's clean enough.

24:08.854 --> 24:10.921
Where do you want me?

24:10.923 --> 24:13.157
There was damage to both
the kidney and the bladder,

24:13.159 --> 24:15.359
but we need a visual to see
how bad they really are.

24:15.361 --> 24:17.094
I stitched a kidney last week,
I could get started...

24:17.096 --> 24:18.429
You know, whatever happens in here today,

24:18.431 --> 24:19.964
that's on your boyfriend's head.

24:19.966 --> 24:22.566
Thomas should never have
turned that patient away.

24:22.568 --> 24:23.934
Dr. Bell.

24:23.936 --> 24:26.937
Someone pass Dr. Williams the retractors.

24:26.939 --> 24:29.306
Wait, you want me to waterski?

24:29.308 --> 24:31.842
- Dawn...
- Someone has to do it.

24:31.844 --> 24:33.243
I've been on this case from the beginning!

24:33.245 --> 24:35.212
Well, you can take it up with Thomas.

24:35.214 --> 24:36.780
As per his memo,

24:36.782 --> 24:39.350
we're limited to one set of
auto-retractors per O.R.,

24:39.352 --> 24:41.151
and ours are in use. So...

24:41.153 --> 24:42.987
get out on the lake.

24:48.026 --> 24:50.761
If you're not gonna open
that abdominal cavity soon,

24:50.763 --> 24:52.329
you can vacate my O.R.

24:52.331 --> 24:54.198
[scoffs]

25:02.140 --> 25:05.009
The lawyers are looking for you,
but we need to talk first.

25:05.011 --> 25:08.212
Okay.

25:08.214 --> 25:09.546
Alex, they're gonna figure out

25:09.548 --> 25:10.948
that we gave her blood thinners.

25:10.950 --> 25:13.317
Maggie, you gave her blood
thinners in good faith.

25:13.319 --> 25:15.352
The situation changed,
and we did the best we could.

25:15.354 --> 25:17.488
No, the lawyer's good.
She's gonna find out eventually.

25:17.490 --> 25:18.889
Well, we followed protocol.

25:18.891 --> 25:20.224
We're gonna lose our licenses.

25:20.226 --> 25:21.792
No, we aren't.

25:21.794 --> 25:23.060
Keep it together.

25:23.062 --> 25:25.529
[cellphone buzzes]

25:25.531 --> 25:27.831
- [sighs]
- What is it?

25:27.833 --> 25:29.933
It's my mother. Gotta go.

25:35.373 --> 25:37.374
So, what, you're just gonna leave?

25:37.376 --> 25:39.877
You're used to it, aren't you?

25:39.879 --> 25:41.178
Have you even thought this through?

25:41.180 --> 25:42.312
I mean, what are you gonna do

25:42.314 --> 25:43.647
when you forget how to use the phone

25:43.649 --> 25:44.982
or when your brain stops telling you

25:44.984 --> 25:46.016
that you need to breathe?!

25:46.018 --> 25:49.086
I'm a dead woman, Alex.

25:49.088 --> 25:50.788
You can't save me.

25:50.790 --> 25:53.090
What does it matter if I die here

25:53.092 --> 25:56.727
or on a beach somewhere with
a bucket full of margaritas?

25:56.729 --> 25:57.728
[coughing]

25:57.730 --> 25:59.096
Damn it!

25:59.098 --> 26:01.298
Hey. You're okay.

26:02.801 --> 26:04.702
Hey, I need some scissors and gauze,

26:04.704 --> 26:06.670
and somebody page this woman's doctor!

26:06.672 --> 26:08.138
Okay, Eunice, you have a post-op bleed

26:08.140 --> 26:09.073
that's constricting your airway.

26:09.075 --> 26:10.374
But you're gonna be fine.

26:10.376 --> 26:12.943
We'll relieve the pressure,
and you'll better right away.

26:12.945 --> 26:13.977
Okay, here we go.

26:13.979 --> 26:16.213
Hold still if you can.

26:16.215 --> 26:17.347
[gasping]

26:17.349 --> 26:19.149
Okay...

26:19.151 --> 26:20.718
Gauze.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.019
[coughing]

26:24.122 --> 26:25.889
- Better?
- Yeah.

26:25.891 --> 26:27.491
Good. Just breathe.

26:27.493 --> 26:30.627
Post-thyroidectomy bleed.
She'll need new sutures.

26:32.363 --> 26:34.565
Stop being such a martyr.

26:39.938 --> 26:42.973
He's hypotensive.
Systolic pressure is under 70.

26:42.975 --> 26:44.074
Push volume.

26:47.545 --> 26:49.113
On it.

26:49.115 --> 26:51.582
Hey, talk to me. How's it looking in there?

26:51.584 --> 26:53.016
Left kidney's pretty battered,

26:53.018 --> 26:54.818
and the bladder is like a popped balloon.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.420
You know, if Cassie has experience,

26:56.422 --> 26:57.788
maybe she <i>should</i> stitch that bladder

26:57.790 --> 26:58.956
before we take the kidney out.

26:58.958 --> 27:00.991
No, I want you leading on this.

27:00.993 --> 27:03.594
Is that a problem?

27:03.596 --> 27:04.962
No.

27:16.641 --> 27:17.674
What's happening?

27:17.676 --> 27:18.809
Surgery.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.344
Well, is he gonna be okay?

27:20.346 --> 27:21.712
- I don't know.
- Well, what do we do now?

27:21.714 --> 27:23.180
<i>We</i> clean up.

27:23.182 --> 27:24.748
There's an urgent care clinic to run.

27:24.750 --> 27:25.816
Remember?

27:25.818 --> 27:28.552
You have something you want to say?

27:28.554 --> 27:30.154
This isn't my fault.

27:30.156 --> 27:31.522
Then whose fault was it?

27:31.524 --> 27:32.823
The man that you turned away?

27:32.825 --> 27:34.391
It was an act of God.

27:34.393 --> 27:35.759
Maybe, but before you got here,

27:35.761 --> 27:37.294
we used to handle those just fine.

27:41.633 --> 27:42.900
Eli?

27:42.902 --> 27:45.202
Hey.

27:47.438 --> 27:50.741
Hey, E... Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

27:50.743 --> 27:53.577
Acetone. I need insulin IV quick!

27:53.579 --> 27:55.412
Uh, uh, we... we need help over here!

27:55.414 --> 27:57.281
I don't have a pulse here, come on!

27:57.283 --> 27:58.515
Hurry! Now!

27:58.517 --> 28:00.617
Come on, Eli, stay with me, bud.
Stay with me.

28:08.883 --> 28:11.785
[panting]

28:11.787 --> 28:12.686
[device squeals]

28:12.688 --> 28:14.087
Clear!

28:14.089 --> 28:15.522
[electric shock]

28:17.926 --> 28:20.093
Dr. Miller, he's gone.

28:20.095 --> 28:21.428
What are you doing? Hit him again!

28:21.430 --> 28:23.096
[panting]

28:30.905 --> 28:33.006
Time of death, 5:07 P.M.

28:33.008 --> 28:34.241
No!

28:35.877 --> 28:37.644
Hit him again.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.448
You put him in this cubicle.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.417
I-I-I thought he was drunk.

28:43.419 --> 28:46.119
And you left him alone,
and you didn't go get help.

28:46.121 --> 28:48.755
This man is an
insulin-dependent diabetic!

28:48.757 --> 28:50.791
I didn't know that! Get your hands off me!

28:50.793 --> 28:52.192
- Or what?
- I...

28:52.194 --> 28:53.627
You'll fire me?

28:53.629 --> 28:55.696
I-I smelled it. He was drunk.

28:55.698 --> 28:59.099
Acetone! You smelled acetone!

28:59.101 --> 29:01.768
You take a first-year med
student out of any hospital,

29:01.770 --> 29:04.204
and they will tell you that
diabetic ketoacidosis

29:04.206 --> 29:05.505
mirrors symptoms of inebriation.

29:05.507 --> 29:06.840
But you...

29:06.842 --> 29:11.311
you saw a Native man with booze
on his breath,

29:11.313 --> 29:13.780
and you filed him into one of
your little boxes.

29:15.249 --> 29:17.551
His name is Eli King.

29:17.553 --> 29:19.152
He's got a wife and sweaty feet,

29:19.154 --> 29:21.355
and now he is dead because of you.

29:29.297 --> 29:31.365
I don't think you understand
what I'm saying.

29:31.367 --> 29:33.033
The surgery wasn't a hard decision,

29:33.035 --> 29:34.167
it was the <i>only</i> decision.

29:34.169 --> 29:35.235
And do you believe Dr. Bell

29:35.237 --> 29:36.570
would have okayed that decision?

29:36.572 --> 29:38.138
I don't see how that's relevant.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.373
She's not chief of surgery.

29:39.375 --> 29:40.741
Just an observation.

29:40.743 --> 29:41.875
Miss Carter,
get to the point, please.

29:41.877 --> 29:42.909
Fine.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.945
Here it is.

29:44.947 --> 29:46.213
We have a young woman in a coma,

29:46.215 --> 29:47.314
and as far as I can tell,

29:47.316 --> 29:49.049
all of the doctors charged with her care

29:49.051 --> 29:50.183
acted unprofessionally.

29:50.185 --> 29:52.052
How exactly did I act unprofessionally?

29:52.054 --> 29:53.520
Even if we overlook the fact

29:53.522 --> 29:55.622
that you used your personal
relationship to get your way...

29:55.624 --> 29:57.758
My personal relationship
doesn't factor into this.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.594
Even if we overlook that,
should you have been in the O.R.

30:00.596 --> 30:02.462
the day Miss Hannigan had her surgery,

30:02.464 --> 30:04.297
I looked on the registry for that day,

30:04.299 --> 30:05.565
and I found two patients...

30:05.567 --> 30:08.702
Luke Reid, age 2, and Martha Reid, age 55.

30:08.704 --> 30:10.504
That's your son and your mother, yes?

30:10.506 --> 30:11.972
Fell at the playground. He's fine.

30:11.974 --> 30:13.473
- It was just a bump.
- And your mother...

30:13.475 --> 30:14.708
Is none of your business.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.677
Still, after a stressful day like that,

30:16.679 --> 30:18.578
I might have taken a mental health day

30:18.580 --> 30:20.047
before I picked up the scalpel.

30:20.049 --> 30:21.948
Well, then it's a good thing
that you're not a doctor,

30:21.950 --> 30:23.183
because we deal with highly stressful

30:23.185 --> 30:24.184
situations all the time.

30:24.186 --> 30:26.019
I'm trying to get to the truth here.

30:26.021 --> 30:28.121
Then ask me about my patient.

30:28.123 --> 30:29.456
Not my mother.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.892
You have to stop this.

30:31.894 --> 30:33.493
[sighs]

30:33.495 --> 30:35.495
Excuse me, this is a...

30:35.497 --> 30:37.864
call I really need to... take.

30:40.601 --> 30:44.071
- How's that bladder?
- Bladder is done.

30:44.073 --> 30:46.106
But I think we're gonna have
to lose that kidney.

30:46.108 --> 30:49.976
Williams, how many nephrectomies
have you done?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.845
I don't know, three or four.

30:51.847 --> 30:53.647
I'm not losing a patient to tired arm.

30:53.649 --> 30:55.015
She's his best shot.

30:55.017 --> 30:56.917
What, are you uncomfortable
with nephrectomies?

30:56.919 --> 30:58.518
Yes, Dawn,
you're sidelining a resident

30:58.520 --> 31:00.120
when she should be banking experience.

31:00.122 --> 31:02.489
What the hell is going on?

31:06.427 --> 31:09.296
Aortic graft is set.

31:09.298 --> 31:11.064
How are your arms feeling?

31:11.066 --> 31:12.432
They're fine.

31:14.902 --> 31:16.670
Switch out with Dr. Kinney.

31:18.172 --> 31:20.373
Right angle.

31:25.813 --> 31:28.081
You have to wake me up, Charlie, please.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.483
Shock me, pour cold water on me,

31:29.485 --> 31:30.917
inject my heart with adrenaline.

31:30.919 --> 31:33.820
- Adrenaline?
- Yeah, I saw it in a movie.

31:33.822 --> 31:35.255
If there was something
I could do to wake you up,

31:35.257 --> 31:36.456
I would have done it by now.

31:36.458 --> 31:39.926
Well, I just can't watch
that lawyer tear them apart.

31:39.928 --> 31:42.996
Okay. Then let's figure this out.

31:42.998 --> 31:45.332
Blood thinners were administered at 3:00.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.634
An hour later, Miss Hannigan
is rushed to the O.R.

31:47.636 --> 31:49.169
Yes, because she had a bowel obstruction.

31:49.171 --> 31:50.971
Weren't you worried that she'd
bleed out on the table?

31:50.973 --> 31:52.873
Of course I was, but we were
prepared for that.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.407
Were you prepared for any of
the other catastrophes

31:54.409 --> 31:56.176
that might have happened with
blood thinners in her system?

31:56.178 --> 31:57.811
What is keeping you here?

31:57.813 --> 32:00.046
I don't know.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.649
Maybe you like it.

32:02.651 --> 32:04.518
Maybe...

32:04.520 --> 32:07.721
it's great not feeling nauseous
from chemo all the time.

32:07.723 --> 32:09.656
Yeah, that's not it.

32:09.658 --> 32:11.525
You sure?

32:11.527 --> 32:13.260
I hate it here.

32:13.262 --> 32:14.795
Why?

32:16.631 --> 32:18.799
Because I'm alone.

32:18.801 --> 32:20.634
Miss Carter, perhaps we should
recess until...

32:20.636 --> 32:22.369
No, we are not taking another recess.

32:22.371 --> 32:24.871
Dr. Reid, how could you bring
this patient into the O.R.?

32:24.873 --> 32:27.174
I was afraid that she would die
of sepsis if I didn't.

32:27.176 --> 32:30.110
And you've never been alone before?

32:32.213 --> 32:35.849
Not since high school, not since Violet.

32:35.851 --> 32:40.320
She wanted to come to this city,
so I followed her.

32:40.322 --> 32:43.290
And she wanted to get married, so...

32:43.292 --> 32:44.891
we got engaged.

32:44.893 --> 32:46.426
But she left.

32:46.428 --> 32:48.929
Yeah.

32:50.898 --> 32:52.599
And I replaced her with...

32:52.601 --> 32:53.733
With Maggie.

33:00.341 --> 33:02.676
I'm scared of being alone.

33:04.879 --> 33:06.479
How did you get the surgery approved?

33:09.283 --> 33:11.284
Dr. Reid?

33:11.286 --> 33:13.153
If I didn't operate, she would have died.

33:13.155 --> 33:15.488
It was a risk I was willing
to take to save her life,

33:15.490 --> 33:17.390
and I would do it again. Now, are we done?

33:17.392 --> 33:19.759
No, we are not.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Reid,

33:19.761 --> 33:21.595
how did you get the surgery approved?

33:21.597 --> 33:23.763
I know you.

33:23.765 --> 33:26.499
You just met me.

33:26.501 --> 33:29.469
No, but I see you.

33:29.471 --> 33:31.471
I see someone who had the courage

33:31.473 --> 33:33.974
to stand up to a small town and say,

33:33.976 --> 33:35.709
"I'm different,"

33:35.711 --> 33:39.246
"whatever the outcome."

33:39.248 --> 33:42.048
I see an aspiring art student. I see...

33:42.050 --> 33:44.517
[chuckles]

33:44.519 --> 33:48.688
I see a hopeless romantic.

33:48.690 --> 33:51.124
And I see a survivor.

33:52.593 --> 33:54.761
You can do this, Bree.

33:54.763 --> 33:56.463
Yes, you can.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.565
You just need to wake up...

33:58.567 --> 34:00.533
and keep fighting.

34:00.535 --> 34:02.402
[crying] I don't have anyone.

34:02.404 --> 34:04.271
You don't need anyone.

34:04.273 --> 34:07.374
You're enough.

34:09.944 --> 34:11.978
I just wanted to see if she was okay.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.751
Yeah, um...

34:17.753 --> 34:19.485
I'll check on Alex.

34:19.487 --> 34:22.422
Maggie: I'm so sorry about all this.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.533
She's awake.

34:33.534 --> 34:35.068
Bree is awake.

34:35.070 --> 34:36.603
- She's okay?
- Where are you going?

34:36.605 --> 34:38.638
- To see my patient.
- Can I come?

34:38.639 --> 34:40.639
Please? I just wanted her back.

34:40.641 --> 34:41.975
I need to see her.

34:41.976 --> 34:43.510
Of course. Come on.

34:53.253 --> 34:54.853
Cassie: We saved him.

34:54.856 --> 34:57.023
Martin.

34:57.025 --> 35:00.660
He lost a kidney, but he's recovering.

35:00.662 --> 35:03.129
We almost had to kick
the drummer out of the room

35:03.131 --> 35:05.398
'cause he kept drumming on all the bedpans.

35:08.736 --> 35:13.172
My first hospital... in Winnipeg...

35:13.174 --> 35:17.810
I-I was too soft and I failed.

35:17.812 --> 35:22.548
1,864 people lost their jobs.

35:25.786 --> 35:29.222
I haven't had a full night sleep since.

35:29.224 --> 35:32.325
No matter how much good I do,

35:32.327 --> 35:36.429
that man's death is my legacy here.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.934
Mr. Leffering? His wife is here.

35:46.707 --> 35:48.808
Are you gonna tell her?

35:51.278 --> 35:53.246
It's okay. I'll go.

35:53.248 --> 35:55.114
No.

35:55.116 --> 35:56.649
No.

35:58.352 --> 36:00.186
This is on me.

36:02.022 --> 36:04.223
It should be me.

36:12.599 --> 36:14.100
[knock on door]

36:16.036 --> 36:20.506
So, the licensing board has
ruled in favor of Hope Zion.

36:20.508 --> 36:22.508
Yeah, I heard.

36:22.510 --> 36:23.943
And...

36:23.945 --> 36:25.611
I bought you this.

36:25.613 --> 36:27.613
- It's pink.
- Mm-hmm, it is.

36:27.615 --> 36:28.915
It's to help you lighten up.

36:28.917 --> 36:31.417
[chuckles]

36:31.419 --> 36:34.120
I'm glad we had a chance to reconnect.

36:34.122 --> 36:36.255
Yeah, me too.

36:36.257 --> 36:37.290
[sets down toothbrush]

36:37.292 --> 36:39.459
But I hear a "but."

36:39.461 --> 36:40.860
But...

36:40.862 --> 36:45.398
Rachel, my life is...
is kind of complicated.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.901
[chuckles] Well, so is mine.

36:48.903 --> 36:51.637
So let's not over-think this, then.

36:57.244 --> 36:59.779
Dr. Reid.

36:59.781 --> 37:01.247
I hope there's no hard feelings.

37:01.249 --> 37:02.749
I was just doing my job.

37:02.751 --> 37:04.884
You and me both.

37:12.159 --> 37:15.461
I came to apologize.
I put you in a bad position.

37:15.463 --> 37:18.264
Yeah, you put three careers and
a patient's life on the line.

37:18.266 --> 37:19.699
I did.

37:19.701 --> 37:23.369
But given the circumstances,
I would do it all again.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.104
Are you gonna report me?

37:27.474 --> 37:29.809
I haven't decided yet.

37:31.478 --> 37:34.480
Well, when you do decide,
shoot me an e-mail.

37:34.482 --> 37:36.649
I'm gonna take a few days off.

37:36.651 --> 37:38.050
Okay.

37:38.052 --> 37:39.852
Are you all right watching Luke
for a few days?

37:39.854 --> 37:41.687
Of course.

37:44.424 --> 37:47.326
My mom's sick.

37:47.328 --> 37:49.529
Terminal, actually.

37:49.531 --> 37:50.997
Alex.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.698
It's not an excuse for what I did,

37:52.700 --> 37:54.233
but I just wanted you to know.

37:54.235 --> 37:55.568
Hey.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.670
Hey.

38:00.340 --> 38:02.375
Hey.

38:02.377 --> 38:05.478
You go, go... be with your mom.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.114
I'll take care of everything else.

38:08.116 --> 38:09.081
Okay?

38:18.926 --> 38:20.660
[footsteps approach]

38:24.097 --> 38:25.364
Hey.

38:25.366 --> 38:27.266
Hey.

38:27.268 --> 38:30.837
Well, I guess I'm not as tough as I thought.

38:30.839 --> 38:33.272
I barely made it to the lobby.

38:38.278 --> 38:42.481
Do you remember that day...

38:42.483 --> 38:45.051
I was walking you home from school,

38:45.053 --> 38:46.853
and it was garbage day,

38:46.855 --> 38:50.590
and we found this old TV
on the side of the road?

38:50.592 --> 38:54.026
Yeah, and you tried to get me to smash it.

38:54.028 --> 38:56.295
But you were so serious.

38:56.297 --> 38:59.365
I thought it would be fun,
but you wouldn't let me.

38:59.367 --> 39:01.901
I think I worked on it every
night for, like, a month

39:01.903 --> 39:03.436
till I got it up and running.

39:03.438 --> 39:06.405
That's who you are, Alex.

39:06.407 --> 39:08.241
You never give up.

39:10.244 --> 39:13.546
I've been thinking.

39:13.548 --> 39:16.449
What if we just went somewhere?

39:16.451 --> 39:18.284
The two of us.

39:18.286 --> 39:21.687
Oh, honey.

39:21.689 --> 39:24.023
I would love that.

39:24.025 --> 39:26.225
Good.

39:28.195 --> 39:29.662
Good.

39:32.399 --> 39:35.001
I'm sorry.
