00:01.910 --> 00:04.705
Six years ago,
The leyland school was blessed

00:04.705 --> 00:06.780
With the arrival
Of dan sullivan.

00:06.780 --> 00:09.774
Four winning seasons,
A state championship.

00:09.774 --> 00:11.749
Ms. Blaine, we're
Suspending taylor from school.

00:11.749 --> 00:13.706
There were pictures posted
Of your son

00:13.706 --> 00:15.533
Which were
Outside the code.

00:15.533 --> 00:17.500
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.606
<i>he was really
Messed up.</i>

00:18.606 --> 00:20.502
We need
To talk with becca.

00:20.502 --> 00:22.488
I do not want her
At those parties.

00:22.488 --> 00:23.515
Bitch looking good, huh?

00:23.515 --> 00:24.533
D-damn.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.420
$20,000 a year
On that school.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.465
You'd think
He'd make better choices.

00:28.465 --> 00:29.542
<i>you know
That girl is just --</i>

00:29.542 --> 00:31.508
Oh, i know you're not
Getting down on the sister.

00:31.508 --> 00:33.306
What were you doing?!

00:33.306 --> 00:34.442
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!

00:34.442 --> 00:35.479
I had a couple
Of beers.

00:35.479 --> 00:37.268
Then everything
Got messed up.

00:37.268 --> 00:38.423
I think
Someone did something to me.

00:38.423 --> 00:40.379
A student is claiming
To have been assaulted.

00:40.379 --> 00:42.217
By one of my players?

00:42.217 --> 00:43.244
Well, you know
That's a lie.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.212
Don't think your kids
Are above mistakes.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.179
You need
To talk to your players.

00:46.179 --> 00:49.161
What are you doing
About what happened to him?
We've taken
Disciplinary action

00:49.161 --> 00:51.128
Appropriate
To the circumstance --
What are you doing
To those boys?!

00:51.128 --> 00:53.103
Tell me what you're doing
To the boys!
The suspension is fair.

00:53.103 --> 00:55.080
As bad as it may seem,
It can get worse.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.015
911.
What's your emergency?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.192
I want to report a rape.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.838 --> 01:15.974
Ms. Blaine?

01:15.974 --> 01:16.962
Yes.

01:16.962 --> 01:18.938
Did you call 911?

01:18.938 --> 01:20.844
When did the assault
Take place?

01:20.844 --> 01:21.921
Last saturday.

01:21.921 --> 01:23.848
You know the location?

01:23.848 --> 01:27.641
Uh, it was a party.
I'm not sure where.

01:27.641 --> 01:31.652
Exact location's gonna be
Important to detectives, okay?

01:31.652 --> 01:32.650
Victim's name?

01:32.650 --> 01:33.657
Taylor.

01:33.657 --> 01:35.604
Where's she now?

01:35.604 --> 01:37.718
Taylor's my son.

01:37.718 --> 01:40.563
The victim's a male?

01:40.563 --> 01:42.529
Yes. My son.

01:42.529 --> 01:44.446
And this
Is a sexual assault?

01:44.446 --> 01:45.591
Yes.

01:45.591 --> 01:48.437
Does your son
Know the assailant?

01:48.437 --> 01:50.531
It was some other kids
At the school.

01:50.531 --> 01:52.438
One kid?
More than one?

01:52.438 --> 01:53.534
He doesn't remember.

01:53.534 --> 01:56.330
Doesn't remember,
Or is not saying?

01:56.330 --> 01:59.452
He was drugged.
He doesn't remember.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.327
Gonna need to take your son
To the hospital,

02:02.327 --> 02:05.241
Get a rape kit done.

02:05.241 --> 02:07.256
Is your son here?

02:07.256 --> 02:08.264
Yes.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.121
Maybe he should come out
And talk to us.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.149
He doesn't want to.

02:11.149 --> 02:13.135
If he's the victim,
We need to speak to him.

02:13.135 --> 02:16.068
He doesn't want to talk
About it.

02:16.068 --> 02:20.119
Look, if he's not going to
Help us, we can't help him.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.869
We have so many schools
That are struggling right now,

02:34.869 --> 02:35.886
That are underfunded!

02:35.886 --> 02:38.811
And what do you guys want to do?
Give them more breaks?

02:38.811 --> 02:40.845
Cut their property taxes?

02:40.845 --> 02:43.849
You all are supposed
To represent the city.

02:43.849 --> 02:45.735
Represent all of us.

02:46.823 --> 02:49.637
Not them!

02:53.599 --> 02:55.644
All right, that school

02:55.644 --> 02:57.630
Is nothing but a bunch of rich,
Spoiled kids.

02:57.630 --> 03:00.633
It's a --
It's a segregation academy.

03:00.633 --> 03:01.641
It's ridiculous.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.568
And you're trying
To make it bigger?

03:03.568 --> 03:05.662
I mean, they're trying to make
This school bigger?

03:05.662 --> 03:09.514
The hell
That they should get to do that!

03:16.410 --> 03:19.295
They're all -- well,
I'm not gonna say idiots...

03:19.295 --> 03:20.461
You just said it.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.268
May i take the opportunity

03:22.268 --> 03:24.264
To distance myself
From the remark?

03:24.264 --> 03:26.279
Stand there and say
The first stupid thing

03:26.279 --> 03:28.216
That falls
Out of their mouths. God!

03:28.216 --> 03:30.280
It is a space
For public comment.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.168
Where was the comment?

03:32.168 --> 03:33.254
If they want to comment,
Comment.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.272
They have nothing to say.

03:34.272 --> 03:35.299
It's part of the process.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.255
They're angry
Because they want to be angry.

03:37.255 --> 03:39.260
Sometimes it's better to listen
Than antagonize.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.037
Well, leslie, you are supposed
To be the voice of the school,

03:42.037 --> 03:44.121
And i see you just --
Just sit there and take it.

03:44.121 --> 03:47.075
Let's focus on us,
Focus on what we're doing.

03:47.075 --> 03:49.071
We have an amazing event
Coming up --

03:49.071 --> 03:50.938
A remarkable evening that --

03:50.938 --> 03:52.914
So we just sat
Through a train wreck,

03:52.914 --> 03:55.018
And you want to put on a dress
And have a night out?

03:55.018 --> 03:57.824
You have some curious
Priorities.

03:57.824 --> 04:01.963
That night out is going to raise
$3 million in one evening.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.830
That's my priority.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.875
Before we adjourn,
I need to make the board

04:05.875 --> 04:09.728
Aware of something
That may or may not be an issue,

04:09.728 --> 04:11.743
But it should be a concern.

04:11.743 --> 04:14.737
There was an allegation made
Against some of our students.

04:14.737 --> 04:16.613
About what?

04:16.613 --> 04:17.721
Nothing's been substantiated.

04:17.721 --> 04:19.716
At this point,
For everyone's sake,

04:19.716 --> 04:21.741
It's important
To maintain anonymity.

04:21.741 --> 04:22.680
Hold on. I --

04:22.680 --> 04:23.717
Legal's been made aware.

04:23.717 --> 04:25.662
Dan sullivan's
Questioned his players,

04:25.662 --> 04:29.466
So all we can do
Is be diligent.

04:29.466 --> 04:33.388
Beyond that, we'll make sure
You're all informed.

04:35.404 --> 04:36.510
Any other business?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.527
That's it.

04:38.516 --> 04:40.383
We're adjourned.

04:40.383 --> 04:44.246
Thank you all.
It's a good day's work.

04:47.377 --> 04:49.363
-take care. Thank you.
-good to see you.

04:49.363 --> 04:51.270
-take care.
-you too.

04:51.270 --> 04:53.147
-i'll see you next week.
-bye-bye.

04:53.147 --> 04:54.233
You need me to stay?

04:54.233 --> 04:58.076
Uh, no, i need you
To type that stuff up for me.

04:58.076 --> 05:00.141
It's very important regarding
This allegation

05:00.141 --> 05:03.035
That, on the record,
We say the right things.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.021
What's the problem,
Leslie?

05:05.021 --> 05:05.999
It was off campus.

05:05.999 --> 05:08.025
The event wasn't sanctioned
By the school,

05:08.025 --> 05:10.069
But there
Is some liability.

05:10.069 --> 05:11.947
It could get very ugly.

05:11.947 --> 05:13.912
So we need to do
The right thing.

05:13.912 --> 05:15.048
We need to say
The right thing.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.844
You keep repeating that --
"say the right thing."

05:17.844 --> 05:20.799
There's the fact procedure
And there's the rumor procedure.

05:20.799 --> 05:22.764
Right now,
We're dealing with rumor.

05:22.764 --> 05:23.930
Don't publicize the rumor.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.805
Promote the opposite
Of what the rumor says.

05:26.805 --> 05:29.798
Provide proof to support
Promotion of the opposite.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.675
What exactly happened,
Leslie?

05:31.675 --> 05:33.770
If this is about the basketball
Team, we can't af--

05:33.770 --> 05:36.645
Dan talked to the team.
No one's admitted anything.

05:36.645 --> 05:39.558
We can discipline individuals
For what we do know,

05:39.558 --> 05:42.661
But we can't be accountable
For what we don't know.

05:42.661 --> 05:46.494
There's nothing more
To do right now.

05:48.489 --> 05:49.626
Okay.

05:49.626 --> 05:51.532
Okay.

06:12.377 --> 06:14.156
Taylor:
I don't want to go.
Anne: i know.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.331
I don't want to talk
To anybody.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.257
It's -- it's just to make sure
You're okay, okay?

06:17.257 --> 06:19.105
I just want it to go away.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.185
That's what they want.

06:23.185 --> 06:26.158
They want to act
Like it never happened.

06:26.158 --> 06:28.954
It'll get better.
I promise.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.069
But it's not
Just gonna go away.

06:31.069 --> 06:32.965
Nurse wells:
Taylor, my name is nurse wells.

06:32.965 --> 06:35.919
I'm the forensic nurse that's
Gonna be working with you today.

06:35.919 --> 06:38.923
So, i want to talk with you
About how this process works.

06:38.923 --> 06:41.827
But do you have any questions,
Just off the top?

06:41.827 --> 06:42.904
No.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.771
Okay. All right.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.875
If anything comes up,
Please let me know, all right?

06:46.875 --> 06:50.728
So, this is how this all goes.
We start and end with paperwork.

06:50.728 --> 06:52.664
As like everything else
In the hospital,

06:52.664 --> 06:54.679
We start with paperwork
And end with paperwork.

06:54.679 --> 06:56.665
I'll talk with you
About medications, too.

06:56.665 --> 06:58.621
We've got antibiotics
For preventing

06:58.621 --> 06:59.728
Sexually transmitted
Infections.

06:59.728 --> 07:01.743
And if that's something
That you want to have,

07:01.743 --> 07:04.589
We'll get that for you
While you're here.

07:04.589 --> 07:06.692
Okay?

07:06.692 --> 07:09.686
If it's all right with you,
I'll draw some blood, too.

07:09.686 --> 07:12.453
And we do that for a couple
Of different reasons.

07:12.453 --> 07:13.618
One of them
Is for a toxicology screen.

07:13.618 --> 07:15.524
Like, if somebody
Might have given you

07:15.524 --> 07:17.570
Something to knock you out,
It could test for that.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.346
We also run a dna test

07:20.346 --> 07:22.302
So that when everything
Goes to the lab,

07:22.302 --> 07:23.507
They can figure out
What things belong to you

07:23.507 --> 07:25.483
And what things
Don't belong to you.

07:25.483 --> 07:28.278
Those are the two reasons
Why we do that.

07:28.278 --> 07:30.254
Most of the rest of the exam
Is talking.

07:30.254 --> 07:33.218
You know, i will ask you
To tell me what you remember

07:33.218 --> 07:34.236
About what was going on.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.253
I'm gonna write it down.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.131
It kind of helps me
Figure out

07:37.131 --> 07:39.106
What i need to be doing
With the rest of the exam.

07:39.106 --> 07:42.110
Why do you --
Why do you need to do that?

07:42.110 --> 07:45.023
Why -- for what you do?
Why do you -- um...

07:45.023 --> 07:48.165
Sorry. Just, what -- why do you
Need that information?

07:48.165 --> 07:50.072
There's a couple
Of different reasons.

07:50.072 --> 07:52.156
One of them is because
It really helps guide the exam.

07:52.156 --> 07:53.994
If i know
What you experienced,

07:53.994 --> 07:55.920
I know what things
I need to look for

07:55.920 --> 07:57.906
And where i need to look
For them.

07:57.906 --> 07:59.902
The other reason
Why we like to get a history

07:59.902 --> 08:01.888
Is because it can go
Into court.

08:01.888 --> 08:03.804
If this ends up
Going to court,

08:03.804 --> 08:05.009
Then i can read your words
To the jury,

08:05.009 --> 08:07.765
And i think that can be
A pretty powerful thing.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.912
The last thing we'll do,
If it's okay with you,

08:12.912 --> 08:14.839
Is take a look
At your anal-genital area

08:14.839 --> 08:17.644
For same reasons --
Looking for any kind of injury

08:17.644 --> 08:19.690
In that area and also
Probably taking some swabs

08:19.690 --> 08:22.564
In case there might be
Any dna to be found there, too.

08:22.564 --> 08:24.580
And that's kind of
The long and short of it.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.555
Any questions so far?

08:29.618 --> 08:31.466
No.

08:31.466 --> 08:33.461
Next, i'd like to take a look
At your anal area.

08:33.461 --> 08:35.408
So, again, i'm gonna touch
On right hip,

08:35.408 --> 08:36.582
And come in
Towards the middle,

08:36.582 --> 08:38.440
And just kind of
Straighten out

08:38.440 --> 08:40.376
Wrinkles in your skin
Right here.

08:40.376 --> 08:42.510
And doing --
Looking at the lower area.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.346
And then looking up
At the top area.

08:45.346 --> 08:47.449
Okay, so,
Hand back on right hip...

08:47.449 --> 08:49.297
...And moving in
Towards center,

08:49.297 --> 08:51.243
And fingers
Right in the middle,

08:51.243 --> 08:53.279
And you'll feel a swab
Right between my fingers.

09:01.172 --> 09:03.118
<i>drink this.</i>

09:15.990 --> 09:17.917
Hey, anne,
Why don't you come with me?

09:17.917 --> 09:18.905
Okay.

09:18.905 --> 09:19.942
Thank you.

09:40.708 --> 09:46.745
It's important for you guys to
Follow up with h.I.V. Testing.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.513
H.I.V.?

09:48.513 --> 09:49.589
Yeah.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.536
I didn't even...

09:51.536 --> 09:54.500
I didn't even think
That could...

09:56.505 --> 09:59.508
Yeah, and of course not.
Why would you think about that?

09:59.508 --> 10:02.433
But in these kinds of
Situations, it's recommended.

10:02.433 --> 10:03.539
So, if you have a doctor

10:03.539 --> 10:06.464
That you all normally see
For things, that's great.

10:06.464 --> 10:08.439
If not, i want to make sure
That you get connected

10:08.439 --> 10:11.245
With the city clinic
For those tests.

10:11.245 --> 10:12.292
-okay?
-okay.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.289
All right.

10:13.289 --> 10:15.276
I wanted to ask
About the clothes

10:15.276 --> 10:19.138
That he was wearing that night
And if he still has them.

10:19.138 --> 10:20.185
Okay.

10:20.185 --> 10:22.101
I-i think so.

10:22.101 --> 10:23.090
Okay.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.285
If y'all haven't
Washed them yet,

10:24.285 --> 10:27.051
Put them in a paper bag
And just tape it closed.

10:27.051 --> 10:29.116
We did do wash.
We did.

10:29.116 --> 10:32.031
But i don't think
They were in there.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.008
No.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.083
Okay. Put them in a paper bag,
Tape it closed,

10:35.083 --> 10:38.066
And then give those
To the detective.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.924
Oh.

10:39.924 --> 10:41.001
Can i just bring
Them to you?

10:41.001 --> 10:42.946
No. Evidence needs to go
To the police.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.873
I've already been
To the police.

10:44.873 --> 10:46.908
Did you talk to a responding
Officer or a detective?

10:46.908 --> 10:47.935
I don't even know.

10:47.935 --> 10:49.951
So, a responding officer's
Usually the person

10:49.951 --> 10:51.956
Who comes out
And just takes a statement.

10:51.956 --> 10:55.690
Normally you'll follow up
With a detective later.

10:55.690 --> 10:58.684
How many people
Do i have to talk to?

10:58.684 --> 10:59.820
It's a lot.

11:34.269 --> 11:37.212
Man: what, you didn't see me?
You didn't see me, huh?

11:37.212 --> 11:38.359
Your dumb ass
Didn't see me?

11:38.359 --> 11:40.157
You need to learn to drive,
Bitch.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.322
Hey, you listening to me?!

11:41.322 --> 11:43.180
Learn to drive!

11:56.112 --> 11:58.156
Indianapolis police.
Detective williams.

11:58.156 --> 12:00.913
Ken?
It's terri.

12:00.913 --> 12:03.887
Terri, what's up?
How's michael?

12:03.887 --> 12:04.973
Good. He's good.

12:04.973 --> 12:09.893
Uh, listen, ken, i got into
An incident on my way in today.

12:09.893 --> 12:10.890
You okay?

12:10.890 --> 12:11.928
I'm fine.

12:11.928 --> 12:15.722
It's just, the other driver,
He was...Aggressive.

12:15.722 --> 12:16.917
White guy? Black guy?

12:16.917 --> 12:20.661
White, of course.
Just really aggressive.

12:20.661 --> 12:22.844
And i got a photo
Of his license plate,

12:22.844 --> 12:25.818
And i was wondering
If you could do anything?

12:25.818 --> 12:28.614
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Send it through.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.686
If anything pops up, i'll, uh --
You know, we'll get into it.

12:31.686 --> 12:33.613
Yeah?
You'll take care of it?

12:33.613 --> 12:36.537
Hey, you know what, terri?
For you...

12:36.537 --> 12:38.611
I'll talk to you later,
Okay?

12:38.611 --> 12:40.410
Thanks, ken.

13:28.056 --> 13:30.813
Hey. Come on.

13:32.996 --> 13:34.903
Take the shot.
Take the shot.

13:34.903 --> 13:36.780
If you want to take the shot,
Take it.

13:36.780 --> 13:37.896
Take it.

13:37.896 --> 13:39.704
Ooh!

13:39.704 --> 13:40.751
Don't call it a comeback.

13:40.751 --> 13:42.658
All right,
Let me see you dunk.

13:42.658 --> 13:44.644
Yeah, "try."

13:44.644 --> 13:45.641
I can't dunk.

13:45.641 --> 13:46.629
Try.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.615
"just try." you're always
Telling me to just try...

13:48.615 --> 13:49.662
Don't talk like that.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.589
You talk like that
At school?

13:51.589 --> 13:52.725
I'll give you
An alley-oop.

13:52.725 --> 13:55.718
"i can't dunk," but you're gonna
Feed me an alley-oop.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.601
<i>all right, so,
Let me tell you something.</i>

13:59.601 --> 14:01.636
You got to start taking care
Of yourself, okay?

14:01.636 --> 14:04.461
You're 17 and you're starting
To smell like you're 17.

14:04.461 --> 14:05.459
I smell good, dad.

14:05.459 --> 14:07.355
Yeah, well,
You're at that age now

14:07.355 --> 14:08.532
Where you're not gonna get
With anybody

14:08.532 --> 14:10.507
If you don't start
Taking care of yourself.

14:10.507 --> 14:12.483
Oh. Ah.

14:12.483 --> 14:16.257
Uh, well,
You're divorced, so...

14:17.324 --> 14:19.250
Oh, damn.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.248
Okay, yeah.

14:20.248 --> 14:22.313
All right.
Don't stink.

14:22.313 --> 14:25.178
Wash up, use deodorant.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.153
Use a body spray, right?
Body spray...

14:27.153 --> 14:30.285
Well, use it.
It's like 101.

14:30.285 --> 14:32.073
Yeah? Come on.

14:32.073 --> 14:34.049
I'm not trying to go around
Smelling like a bitch.

14:34.049 --> 14:35.205
Hey.

14:35.205 --> 14:37.991
Hey.

14:37.991 --> 14:39.976
Come on.

14:39.976 --> 14:42.002
You think you got
All the answers, don't you?

14:45.934 --> 14:48.038
Oh. Ah!
And the rebound.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.189
Hey, uh, bad time?

15:58.189 --> 16:00.097
Just end-of-the-day
Housekeeping.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.023
It's the kind of world
We live in.

16:02.023 --> 16:04.908
Hey, uh, this is for you.

16:04.908 --> 16:06.883
You -- you said
Some very nice things about me

16:06.883 --> 16:09.956
At that fundraiser,
And, uh, well, thank you.

16:09.956 --> 16:12.880
Oh. All deserved.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.804
Wow.
How do you do this?

16:15.804 --> 16:19.726
I know, i know.
You can't tell me your secrets.

16:19.726 --> 16:21.722
Oh, you know, it's not magic.

16:21.722 --> 16:23.677
It's just patience.

16:23.677 --> 16:26.641
So, listen, dan,
We have to talk.

16:26.641 --> 16:28.696
The incident that happened
With the team,

16:28.696 --> 16:30.810
We need to close it out,
And we need to do it

16:30.810 --> 16:32.756
In a way that,
If it comes to it,

16:32.756 --> 16:35.533
People understand
We took it seriously.

16:35.533 --> 16:36.530
Okay.

16:36.530 --> 16:38.526
You need to discipline
One of your players.

16:38.526 --> 16:39.514
For what?

16:39.514 --> 16:41.500
For what happened
At that party.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.446
I talked to my boys.
Nothing happened.

16:43.446 --> 16:45.452
Something happened.
There was drinking, there --

16:45.452 --> 16:46.518
Have you seen
The pictures

16:46.518 --> 16:48.435
The kids
Have been texting around?

16:48.435 --> 16:50.520
Suspend the kids
That are spreading that crap,

16:50.520 --> 16:52.436
But don't take it out
On the team.

16:52.436 --> 16:54.501
The mother of the boy
Has been in this office,

16:54.501 --> 16:56.496
And she's been using
Some ugly language.

16:56.496 --> 16:59.282
Well, her kid got wasted drunk,
You know,

16:59.282 --> 17:01.228
So she's got to blame
Somebody.

17:01.228 --> 17:05.190
"rape."
That's the word she used.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.366
That's insane.

17:06.366 --> 17:09.121
And compared to that,

17:09.121 --> 17:12.115
We have to look thoughtful
And responsible.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.098
People think this school
Is about entitlement.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.234
We have to promote
The opposite.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.161
If you make those kids
Look guilty,

17:18.161 --> 17:21.006
Then next thing, people are
Saying they're guilty.

17:21.006 --> 17:23.002
I know. You're concerned
About their feelings.

17:23.002 --> 17:24.079
No, this is not
About their feelings.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.935
If those boys want to go play
Ball in college --

17:25.935 --> 17:27.012
If they even want to go
To college --

17:27.012 --> 17:28.890
Even one game,
That stays on their record.

17:28.890 --> 17:30.036
You're talking
About one player.

17:30.036 --> 17:31.883
I'm talking
About the team.

17:31.883 --> 17:33.829
And when people come
And they ask us

17:33.829 --> 17:35.944
Why we didn't do anything
About the team, we did.

17:35.944 --> 17:38.788
But if we're the ones deciding
What we're going to do,

17:38.788 --> 17:40.735
Then we can do
What has the least impact.

17:40.735 --> 17:41.831
You're being reactionary.

17:41.831 --> 17:42.918
This is a little act.

17:42.918 --> 17:46.672
One player, one game --
To prevent more hurt elsewhere.

17:46.672 --> 17:48.796
But there will be a notation
In a file

17:48.796 --> 17:52.590
That says the player was sat
For disciplinary reasons.

17:55.612 --> 17:57.549
Who am i supposed to sit?

17:57.549 --> 17:59.564
Well, it was
The captain's party.

17:59.564 --> 18:01.619
Kevin?
You want me to sit kevin?

18:01.619 --> 18:03.605
I don't think
We want to get into things

18:03.605 --> 18:04.653
With the lacroix family.

18:04.653 --> 18:06.579
Who's the other captain?

18:06.579 --> 18:08.624
Eric tanner.

18:08.624 --> 18:10.511
Whatever you decide,

18:10.511 --> 18:13.376
Just put it in writing
For me, please.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.330
Everybody know
About this?

18:25.330 --> 18:27.226
No, not everybody.
Mnh-mnh.

18:27.226 --> 18:28.214
But people know.

18:28.214 --> 18:29.291
It's one game.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.316
And what about kevin?
He's the other team captain.

18:31.316 --> 18:33.262
How come you're not doing
Anything to him?

18:33.262 --> 18:35.258
Now we're -- we're looking
At each player individually.

18:35.258 --> 18:37.253
Yeah, but you're coming at me.
You're not coming at him.

18:37.253 --> 18:39.032
So how's that fair?

18:39.032 --> 18:41.986
One game. All right?

18:43.023 --> 18:45.987
Oh, hey, eric.
What's up, bro?

18:45.987 --> 18:48.081
Want to get in
On the game?

18:48.081 --> 18:49.098
Eric.

18:49.098 --> 18:50.916
Eric!

18:50.916 --> 18:51.954
That little bitch
Said something.

18:51.954 --> 18:53.959
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.836
They're not doing anything
To you.

18:55.836 --> 18:56.972
I know he's running
His mouth.

18:56.972 --> 18:57.979
What's he gonna say?

18:57.979 --> 18:59.817
He's not even in school
Anymore.

18:59.817 --> 19:00.933
He could still
Pop off, kev.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.939
You're the one running
Your mouth, though, man.

19:02.939 --> 19:05.833
You need to shut the hell up
And let it be.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.760
Like, let it go.

19:08.807 --> 19:11.643
I got you on this.

19:11.643 --> 19:12.759
How you got me?

19:12.759 --> 19:13.786
'cause it's done.
That's it.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.683
After this,
Nobody's speaking on it.

19:15.683 --> 19:19.546
Y--
You just need to chill, man.

19:19.546 --> 19:21.561
Do it for the team,
All right?

19:21.561 --> 19:24.476
And don't be a bitch
About it.

19:24.476 --> 19:26.441
Damn.

19:43.453 --> 19:45.311
I don't know.
One of those...

19:46.368 --> 19:48.216
Come on, girl.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.287
What's up?

19:51.287 --> 19:52.295
Hey, yo, what up?

19:52.295 --> 19:53.204
Lost?

19:53.204 --> 19:54.251
Hey, st--
What?

19:54.251 --> 19:56.108
Go roll up on your own.
Sean, no. Back off.

19:56.108 --> 19:57.107
You guys, st--
Chris: hey.

19:57.107 --> 19:58.104
Do me better.

19:58.104 --> 20:01.019
Hey.
We got a problem?

20:01.019 --> 20:03.192
Mateo,
You got a problem?

20:03.192 --> 20:05.069
Nah.

20:05.069 --> 20:07.963
Then you need to figure out
Where you need to be.

20:10.137 --> 20:11.925
You have class?

20:11.925 --> 20:12.912
Yeah.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.844
Then get to class.
Let's go.

20:19.808 --> 20:22.832
Everything straight
With these two?

20:22.832 --> 20:24.758
Boys being boys?

20:24.758 --> 20:25.914
Yeah.

20:25.914 --> 20:29.856
I want you to be mindful hanging
Out between class, okay?

20:29.856 --> 20:31.693
Yeah.

20:31.693 --> 20:34.618
Get where you need to be.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.597
Whoa.

20:39.597 --> 20:41.523
You're already late.

20:41.523 --> 20:44.526
Let's not get
Into an accident.

20:44.526 --> 20:48.656
What you're doing
Is wrong, and it's cruel.

20:48.656 --> 20:51.412
You're literally trying to take
Food out of children's mouths.

20:51.412 --> 20:52.587
Nobody's trying
To touch hhfk.

20:52.587 --> 20:55.374
Okay, give kids
A free breakfast -- yes.

20:55.374 --> 20:57.398
But it needs to happen
Before first period,

20:57.398 --> 20:58.475
Not during first period.

20:58.475 --> 21:01.281
Oh, we're talking about families
Of different means.

21:01.281 --> 21:03.366
Getting their kids to school
Before class isn't practical.

21:03.366 --> 21:05.292
Getting kids fed
Is directly related

21:05.292 --> 21:07.426
To how they perform in class.
Nobody's arguing about
Providing a meal for the kids.

21:07.426 --> 21:10.202
A-all they're talking about
Is when it happens.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.289
Well, that's the problem.

21:11.289 --> 21:13.274
We're not just talking
About feeding kids.

21:13.274 --> 21:15.121
This is
A civil rights issue.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.115
What, is that --
Is that funny to you?

21:18.115 --> 21:19.192
A civil rights issue?

21:19.192 --> 21:21.188
For me, for a lot of people
In this room.

21:21.188 --> 21:25.031
I don't see the attack dogs.
I don't see the water hoses.

21:25.031 --> 21:26.996
So what's the problem?

21:26.996 --> 21:28.973
That the people being hurt
Don't look like you?

21:28.973 --> 21:31.126
Or that little brown kids
Don't have rights?

21:31.126 --> 21:33.033
We have a lot
To cover tonight.

21:33.033 --> 21:35.907
Does this even have anything
To do with your school?

21:35.907 --> 21:38.861
Not mine.

21:38.861 --> 21:40.887
Ours.

21:40.887 --> 21:43.850
We're supposed to be here
To problem-solve.

21:43.850 --> 21:45.866
So why don't we do that?

21:45.866 --> 21:47.910
Days go by,
Year in and out.

21:47.910 --> 21:49.729
And we're not
Talking about

21:49.729 --> 21:51.763
If we should be teaching
Singapore math

21:51.763 --> 21:53.819
Or if the reading levels
Are appropriate.

21:53.819 --> 21:57.691
We are talking about what time
To serve the kiddies food.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.594
I have three degrees --
Two of them from i.U. --

22:01.594 --> 22:03.589
And i feel like
A fast-food manager

22:03.589 --> 22:05.545
As much
As a superintendent.

22:05.545 --> 22:06.592
And monica --

22:06.592 --> 22:08.489
Oh. She's fierce.

22:08.489 --> 22:10.465
I like her.
I really respect her.

22:10.465 --> 22:11.591
But she's
A bleeding heart.

22:11.591 --> 22:15.464
Hhfk -- good intentions,
Poorly executed.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.389
It's that simple.

22:17.389 --> 22:19.544
But nothing's that simple.

22:19.544 --> 22:21.460
I want to do something
About it,

22:21.460 --> 22:23.505
And you speaking to it,
It means something.

22:23.505 --> 22:25.421
I'm just trying to run
My school.

22:25.421 --> 22:27.417
<i>our schools.
Isn't that what you said?</i>

22:27.417 --> 22:28.445
Why stir things?

22:28.445 --> 22:30.391
Too many teachers,
They just want to keep

22:30.391 --> 22:32.367
Their mouths shut,
Heads down,

22:32.367 --> 22:35.133
Let the unions fight it out
With the legislator.

22:35.133 --> 22:36.121
That solves what?

22:36.121 --> 22:37.128
That's politics.

22:37.128 --> 22:38.304
How's politics working
For students?

22:38.304 --> 22:40.161
You need help
With your budget.

22:40.161 --> 22:41.169
I don't need help.

22:41.169 --> 22:43.224
Okay,
My school needs help,

22:43.224 --> 22:46.108
And you're talking
About grabbing a third rail.

22:46.108 --> 22:48.183
You're not gonna get anyone
To back you.

22:48.183 --> 22:49.991
I need you to back me.

22:49.991 --> 22:53.142
If i can win a few battles,
Then i can fight some new ones.

22:53.142 --> 22:55.899
Then we can all
Start winning.

22:55.899 --> 22:57.993
Doctor...

22:57.993 --> 23:01.994
I'm seriously not trying
To get into this.

23:11.775 --> 23:12.753
What's up?

23:12.753 --> 23:13.701
Terri: what's up?

23:13.701 --> 23:14.778
Nothing.

23:14.778 --> 23:16.823
Uh, eric was talking about going
To chicago this weekend --

23:16.823 --> 23:18.680
You have something
You want to tell me?

23:20.597 --> 23:22.562
Sit down.

23:26.603 --> 23:29.656
Do you have something
You want to tell me?

23:41.353 --> 23:43.368
What is that?

23:43.368 --> 23:45.334
A receipt?

23:45.334 --> 23:48.258
For what?

23:48.258 --> 23:51.429
Do i really need to sit here
And punk you?

23:51.429 --> 23:54.206
I got her a gift.

23:54.206 --> 23:55.262
Who?

23:55.262 --> 23:56.250
Val.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.185
You got her a $900 gift?

23:59.185 --> 24:01.239
What, you thought i didn't check
Your credit-card receipts,

24:01.239 --> 24:03.107
Or you thought
I would be okay with you

24:03.107 --> 24:05.171
-spending this kind of money?
-hey, she's my -- she's my girl.

24:07.048 --> 24:09.113
How long have you been
Seeing her?

24:09.113 --> 24:11.178
I don't know.

24:11.178 --> 24:13.983
A couple of months?
Maybe?

24:15.939 --> 24:17.895
What was it, kevin?

24:17.895 --> 24:19.012
A bracelet.

24:19.012 --> 24:21.896
What did she promise you?

24:21.896 --> 24:25.798
What did she tell you she was
Gonna do for that bracelet?

24:25.798 --> 24:26.767
Nothing.

24:27.962 --> 24:31.717
We got into a fight.

24:32.744 --> 24:36.735
Okay, so, you got her
A slick bracelet,

24:36.735 --> 24:39.660
And because you were
So slick,

24:39.660 --> 24:43.572
She got back with you
And it was all good?

24:46.713 --> 24:50.486
Are you having sexual relations
With her?

24:50.486 --> 24:52.463
Mom, please don't say it
Like that. Why --

24:52.463 --> 24:54.606
Well, how do you
Want me to say it?
Any other way but that one.

24:54.606 --> 24:57.471
What, you roll up on her?
Knocking the boots?

24:57.471 --> 24:58.528
Getting busy?

24:58.528 --> 25:00.475
Nobody says
Any of those things.

25:00.475 --> 25:01.551
That's what you all do?

25:01.551 --> 25:04.367
No, she's --
She's not like that.

25:04.367 --> 25:08.378
Hmm, well, for $900,
She could be.

25:08.378 --> 25:12.241
That's how it's gonna be
From now on.

25:12.241 --> 25:15.303
Good looks, skills.
You've got money.

25:15.303 --> 25:17.151
There are girls out there,

25:17.151 --> 25:19.343
They're gonna be coming hard
At you for that.

25:19.343 --> 25:22.219
They're gonna be trying to be
Your baby mama

25:22.219 --> 25:24.283
Just so they can get paid.

25:24.283 --> 25:26.141
That's how they are.

25:28.057 --> 25:31.969
And the last time val
Was anywhere near $900 --

25:31.969 --> 25:33.975
Do you think i'm stupid?

25:33.975 --> 25:37.946
Some of these girls out here
Are gonna hope that you are.

25:37.946 --> 25:40.099
Then how am i
Supposed to know?

25:40.099 --> 25:42.886
Well, does her family
Have any money?

25:42.886 --> 25:44.881
Because if her family
Has money,

25:44.881 --> 25:47.005
Then she doesn't want
Anything from you.

25:47.005 --> 25:51.816
But these other girls,
Running around here, broke,

25:51.816 --> 25:55.679
Talking about,
"i want me some rocks,

25:55.679 --> 25:57.812
Show me the rocks," i...

25:57.812 --> 26:00.717
Those are straight hos.

26:00.717 --> 26:03.602
You can leave those
For the wts,

26:03.602 --> 26:05.558
'cause you're better
Than that.

26:05.558 --> 26:09.598
You hear
What i'm trying to say?

26:09.598 --> 26:11.486
Yeah.

26:13.540 --> 26:15.438
All right, now,
You got to get it back.

26:15.438 --> 26:16.465
Hm?

26:16.465 --> 26:19.389
She doesn't get to keep
A $900 bracelet.

26:19.389 --> 26:21.444
But i gave it
To her already.

26:21.444 --> 26:23.420
What did you
Buy it with?

26:23.420 --> 26:26.324
Mom, that's nothing to you.
That's $900.

26:26.324 --> 26:29.308
Are you serious?

26:29.308 --> 26:32.281
You get it back, kevin,
And you get it back today.

26:32.281 --> 26:36.204
If not, i will go over there
Myself with the police,

26:36.204 --> 26:39.206
Because as far as i'm concerned,
She stole it.

27:26.646 --> 27:30.519
The avedon arts building?

27:30.519 --> 27:34.589
The avedon library?

27:36.456 --> 27:38.649
The avedon [clears throat]
Athletic center?

27:38.649 --> 27:40.477
I wasn't good at sports.

27:40.477 --> 27:42.502
The avedon
Computer science center?

27:42.502 --> 27:44.497
We know you're good
At computers.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.405
Yeah.

27:46.405 --> 27:49.387
Look, your school's not really
A priority for me.

27:49.387 --> 27:50.475
I don't have kids.

27:50.475 --> 27:52.312
These are
All our children.

27:52.312 --> 27:54.338
I don't need
The fundraising speech.

27:54.338 --> 27:55.365
It's not a speech.

27:55.365 --> 27:58.180
It's rich kids going
To a rich kid's school.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.144
I went to a public school.
I turned out okay.

28:01.144 --> 28:03.229
This is an opportunity
For you to start building

28:03.229 --> 28:05.115
Your own legacy.

28:05.115 --> 28:07.220
The name that goes
On the building is yours,

28:07.220 --> 28:08.267
Not your father's.

28:08.267 --> 28:11.024
A million dollars
For naming rights,

28:11.024 --> 28:14.085
For the right to put your name
Where it matters.

28:14.085 --> 28:16.970
You know a good deal
When you see one.

28:16.970 --> 28:19.133
Yeah. I know a good pitch
When i hear one, too.

28:20.122 --> 28:22.038
Okay.
Let me think about it.

28:22.038 --> 28:23.876
-okay.
-then we'll talk.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.852
-you bet.
-i'll take care of these.

28:25.852 --> 28:26.968
-okay.
-you know what?

28:26.968 --> 28:28.825
I'm gonna go
To that gala of yours.

28:28.825 --> 28:29.882
Put me down
For a couple of tickets.

28:29.882 --> 28:30.929
Okay, i will.

28:32.797 --> 28:34.733
Son of a bitch.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.847
He talked to me
Like i was 8 years old.

28:36.847 --> 28:38.704
"i went to public school."

28:38.704 --> 28:40.720
The only reason
He went to public school

28:40.720 --> 28:42.725
Is 'cause his dad
Was running for office.

28:42.725 --> 28:45.650
Nobody votes for a politician
Whose kids are in private.

28:45.650 --> 28:48.673
I love that if the kids you care
About come from means,

28:48.673 --> 28:51.557
You're not supposed to care
About them.

28:51.557 --> 28:54.531
I mean, even someone with money
Thinks that.

28:54.531 --> 28:56.486
I just -- ugh --

28:56.486 --> 29:00.418
Getting sick
Of the whole dance.

29:00.418 --> 29:00.849
Resign.

29:00.849 --> 29:02.543
I'm sorry?

29:02.543 --> 29:04.459
Resign.

29:04.459 --> 29:07.561
That's really
Your career advice?

29:07.561 --> 29:10.397
Is being headmaster
Really your career?

29:10.397 --> 29:13.311
Capital development
Is my profession.

29:13.311 --> 29:15.277
But it's not your school,
So what do you care if --

29:15.277 --> 29:17.242
Well, i could say
It's not your company,

29:17.242 --> 29:18.261
So what do you care,

29:18.261 --> 29:20.246
Except you have
A long-term contract.

29:20.246 --> 29:22.370
If people at that place
Aren't interested enough
To put money into it --

29:22.370 --> 29:24.148
"that place"?

29:33.059 --> 29:36.063
This...

29:36.063 --> 29:38.948
Is not a good topic
For me.

29:38.948 --> 29:40.943
Never is.

29:42.959 --> 29:47.928
I care about what i do.
What i do is important.

29:47.928 --> 29:50.803
Okay.

29:50.803 --> 29:51.988
Here's the good news.

29:53.815 --> 29:54.942
The goal is in sight.

29:54.942 --> 29:57.806
Then i can learn
To like new york

29:57.806 --> 30:04.643
And join you at your nameless,
Faceless, godless institution.

30:09.573 --> 30:13.593
We gonna make it
Through the next year?

30:13.593 --> 30:17.614
We gonna make it
Through the next year?

30:17.614 --> 30:19.423
I'm not going anywhere.

30:39.816 --> 30:41.654
Yeah, great.
Fine. Good.

30:41.654 --> 30:44.579
Well,
I think she'd like it.

30:44.579 --> 30:46.723
Look, whatever you get your mom,
She's gonna appreciate it.

30:46.723 --> 30:48.720
We should throw her
A surprise party.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.528
She doesn't like surprises.

30:50.528 --> 30:52.652
I like surprises,
So we should do it.

30:52.652 --> 30:55.479
It is a big birthday
For your mom.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.591
I don't know if it's the one
We should be experimenting on.

30:58.591 --> 31:01.487
Hey, um...

31:01.487 --> 31:04.452
So, your mom, she wanted me
To have a talk with you.

31:04.452 --> 31:06.360
And, you know,
Just, uh --

31:06.360 --> 31:08.316
You know,
Just be mindful of guys.

31:08.316 --> 31:09.324
[ laughs ]

31:09.324 --> 31:10.352
Hey. Hey, come on.

31:10.352 --> 31:13.316
You know,
Guys are gonna be coming at you,

31:13.316 --> 31:15.412
And, you know,
You need to be...

31:15.412 --> 31:17.240
You need to be smart.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.336
Like use a condom?

31:18.336 --> 31:19.394
No.

31:19.394 --> 31:22.259
No, like -- like don't do
Anything like it at all.

31:22.259 --> 31:25.116
Well, it's kind of late
For that.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.151
To be talking about it.

31:27.151 --> 31:29.049
I've seen porn.

31:29.049 --> 31:31.055
That's where you think
You learned about sex?

31:31.055 --> 31:32.211
Well, you didn't
Talk about it.

31:32.211 --> 31:34.039
Hey, don't act all proud

31:34.039 --> 31:35.996
'cause you got what you think
You know from a website.

31:35.996 --> 31:37.952
No, i got it from people
Who know what i'm going through,

31:37.952 --> 31:39.119
People my age.
Well, what are you
Going through?

31:39.119 --> 31:41.895
Well, what are you
Going through?
I'm just --
I'm just going through life.

31:41.895 --> 31:43.931
Well, what does that mean --
"i'm going through"?
I'm just going through life.

31:43.931 --> 31:45.986
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're going through.

31:45.986 --> 31:48.012
But so -- don't just --
Just don't...

31:48.012 --> 31:50.799
-every other word -- "don't."
-...Do things just to do them.

31:50.799 --> 31:51.946
Don't think some crap
You see on the internet

31:51.946 --> 31:53.972
Or how other people tell you
Things are is --

31:53.972 --> 31:55.800
It's not
That big of a deal.

31:55.800 --> 31:56.827
But it is a big deal.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.873
Okay, it is a big deal
If you do something wrong.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.691
And not everybody
Gets that.

32:00.691 --> 32:02.836
Did you see -- you see those
Pictures that are going around?

32:02.836 --> 32:04.793
The kid from school
Got drunk at the party?

32:04.793 --> 32:06.720
-did you see that?
-yes. Everybody saw those.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.757
Yeah, everybody saw those.

32:07.757 --> 32:09.615
Everybody saw
That he's a dumbass,

32:09.615 --> 32:10.613
And his life is ruined.

32:10.613 --> 32:12.678
-he got drunk. That's all.
-$55.54.

32:12.678 --> 32:14.546
Dan: well, i don't know
What he was doing,

32:14.546 --> 32:16.503
But that's out there
Forever, all right?

32:16.503 --> 32:18.459
And once it's out there,
There's not anything

32:18.459 --> 32:21.572
Anybody can do about it, so --
So don't be him.

32:21.572 --> 32:26.394
Well, i'm not him,
Nor do i even know him.

32:26.394 --> 32:28.362
So, i don't know why
You have to assume

32:28.362 --> 32:30.328
I'm gonna do
Something wrong.

32:30.328 --> 32:31.316
I don't. I just...

32:31.316 --> 32:32.324
Thanks.

32:34.271 --> 32:36.317
Hey, come on.

32:55.023 --> 32:57.019
Hey.

32:59.075 --> 33:00.162
You okay?

33:00.162 --> 33:02.959
Why did you show those pictures
To my mom?

33:02.959 --> 33:04.065
She already knew
About them.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.932
She kept texting me.

33:06.932 --> 33:08.018
So?

33:08.018 --> 33:10.944
Look, i didn't tell her nothing,
'cause i don't know nothing.

33:10.944 --> 33:13.800
You should have been straight
With her, first off.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.855
Why would i tell her
Anything?

33:15.855 --> 33:17.921
Because she's your mom.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.746
And i'm supposed to be
Your girlfriend.

33:20.746 --> 33:22.861
You don't talk to her.

33:22.861 --> 33:24.679
You don't even talk to me
Anymore.

33:24.679 --> 33:26.657
Look, i just don't want to talk
About that.

33:26.657 --> 33:28.752
Are you good?
I'm -- i just said
I'm not trying to...

33:28.752 --> 33:31.627
I just want to know
If you're good.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.593
You can tell me that,
Right?

33:38.554 --> 33:40.629
Damn.

34:21.036 --> 34:22.974
Anne:
They keep blaming taylor.

34:22.974 --> 34:24.962
"does he have a problem
With drinking?"

34:24.962 --> 34:26.097
"does he have a problem
With drugs?"

34:26.097 --> 34:28.904
"oh, just -- just take him
To see someone and go away."

34:28.904 --> 34:30.900
How's taylor doing?

34:30.900 --> 34:32.887
Depressed?

34:32.887 --> 34:35.001
He's just sad.

34:35.001 --> 34:37.985
Does he engage
With you at all?

34:37.985 --> 34:40.871
I got him
To see a doctor.

34:40.871 --> 34:44.844
But i-i-i think that scared him
More than helped him.

34:44.844 --> 34:48.797
There doesn't have to be a rush
To deal with this.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.741
Victims are allowed time
To decide

34:51.741 --> 34:53.766
If they want to pursue
Their case.

34:53.766 --> 34:55.773
Well, he waited
To say anything,

34:55.773 --> 34:58.580
And -- and they act
Like it's his fault.

34:58.580 --> 35:01.545
I waited to tell the police,
And they -- they say,

35:01.545 --> 35:03.531
You know,
You're negligent.

35:03.531 --> 35:06.456
There's a time,
There's a window, for victims,

35:06.456 --> 35:07.553
When they're ready to talk.

35:07.553 --> 35:08.660
It might...

35:08.660 --> 35:11.407
I'm saying,
Consider it might be better

35:11.407 --> 35:12.613
For taylor to wait
Until he's ready.

35:12.613 --> 35:15.429
So i should
Just leave it alone?

35:15.429 --> 35:17.514
You should make sure
That what you're doing

35:17.514 --> 35:21.339
Is having a positive effect
On your son.

35:24.382 --> 35:27.288
<i>how are you holding up?</i>

35:27.288 --> 35:29.274
Eh.

35:29.274 --> 35:31.300
If you start feeling
Overwhelmed,

35:31.300 --> 35:33.365
If you feel stressed
Or anxious...

35:33.365 --> 35:37.140
Yeah, yeah.
I know the signs.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.285
I'm fine.

35:41.152 --> 35:45.116
Well, i'm not fine,
But i'm okay.

35:45.116 --> 35:47.092
Okay.

35:47.092 --> 35:49.029
Yeah.

36:17.657 --> 36:18.665
Damn.

36:18.665 --> 36:19.733
Eric.

36:19.733 --> 36:21.759
That thing is sweet.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.735
Yeah. Wanna drive?

36:23.735 --> 36:25.672
Serious?

36:25.672 --> 36:27.668
Not gonna wreck it,
Are you?

36:27.668 --> 36:29.477
Hell no, man.

36:29.477 --> 36:32.471
Beat the hell out of that bitch,
But i ain't gonna wreck it.

36:32.471 --> 36:33.528
All right, then.

36:45.318 --> 36:48.252
Ow!

37:01.119 --> 37:04.064
You're just
A rough boy, huh?

37:04.064 --> 37:06.179
You a rough boy, eric?

37:06.179 --> 37:11.979
No.

37:24.026 --> 37:26.012
Stop it!

37:26.012 --> 37:28.809
Stop.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.920
I don't like it like that,
All right?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.867
What do you like?

37:37.742 --> 37:40.826
I just want to kiss.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.822
Okay.

37:42.822 --> 37:45.649
Hey, it's okay.

37:49.611 --> 37:51.528
It's okay.

37:54.454 --> 37:55.501
Hey.

37:55.501 --> 37:56.598
Hey.

38:09.326 --> 38:10.324
Name?

38:10.324 --> 38:11.322
My name or...?

38:11.322 --> 38:12.349
Your son's?

38:12.349 --> 38:13.437
Taylor blaine.

38:13.437 --> 38:16.213
Taylor.
How old is he?

38:16.213 --> 38:18.210
17.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.147
And this is about
Last saturday night --

38:20.147 --> 38:21.224
-the party?
-yeah.

38:21.224 --> 38:24.139
The school's already been
In contact with the department.

38:24.139 --> 38:27.143
They gave us a summary
Of events, pictures.

38:27.143 --> 38:28.132
That's your son?

38:28.132 --> 38:29.101
Yes.

38:29.101 --> 38:30.177
Was he drinking
That night?

38:30.177 --> 38:31.235
He did not get drunk.

38:31.235 --> 38:34.080
Somebody put something
In his drink.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.086
Something what?
Ghb?

38:36.086 --> 38:37.944
They drugged him.

38:37.944 --> 38:40.899
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.

38:40.899 --> 38:42.886
Why would they
Want to give him drugs?

38:42.886 --> 38:44.862
They don't like him.

38:44.862 --> 38:46.878
That's a lot of effort just
Because you don't like somebody.

38:46.878 --> 38:47.857
Why would they want --

38:47.857 --> 38:49.833
I don't -- that's --
That's -- that's your job.

38:49.833 --> 38:50.940
That's...

38:50.940 --> 38:53.805
That's what you need
To find out.

38:53.805 --> 38:56.790
You really want to do this
To your son?

38:56.790 --> 38:58.697
My son was raped.

38:58.697 --> 39:00.664
That's a specific category
Of crime.

39:00.664 --> 39:01.780
Forced intercourse with
A member of the opposite sex.

39:01.780 --> 39:03.698
What do you want to call it?
What do you want to call it?

39:03.698 --> 39:06.672
I don't care what you call it.
I just need you to do something.

39:13.698 --> 39:17.493
They -- they were taking
Pictures, there was drinking.

39:17.493 --> 39:19.440
They -- they talked
About him online.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.547
You can't do something
About that?

39:20.547 --> 39:22.632
That's for the --
You can't do something
With that?

39:22.632 --> 39:24.460
That's for the school
To handle.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.557
-why? It's a crime.
-look --

39:25.557 --> 39:29.352
Some of these kids are minors.
Your son is a minor.

39:29.352 --> 39:31.358
This is a lot
To put them through.

39:31.358 --> 39:33.492
Kids do dumb stuff.

39:33.492 --> 39:37.277
Now, i'm not talking about
Your son, i'm talking about...

39:37.277 --> 39:40.311
Look, i've got a 15-year-old.
I know how it is.

39:40.311 --> 39:43.177
I'd maybe...

39:43.177 --> 39:45.133
If you think your son's

39:45.133 --> 39:48.118
Got a drinking problem
Or something,

39:48.118 --> 39:51.251
You should really try
To get him some help.

39:51.251 --> 39:53.217
Okay.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.604
You go to these people
Asking for help.

40:29.604 --> 40:33.586
The minute you start talking,
You can see it.

40:33.586 --> 40:34.613
They don't believe you.

40:34.613 --> 40:37.519
They -- they don't -- they won't
Even call it what it is

40:37.519 --> 40:39.604
Because they don't think
It happens to boys.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.500
Then i start
Doubting myself.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.605
Maybe i got it wrong.

40:44.605 --> 40:49.378
S-so i go online,
And i find all these articles.

40:49.378 --> 40:53.350
Schools, sports teams,
Boys getting assaulted.

40:53.350 --> 40:55.317
It happens
More than you think.

40:55.317 --> 40:57.313
I mean, that -- that school
Wants to hide it.

40:57.313 --> 40:58.470
The police
Want to ignore it.

40:58.470 --> 41:02.403
I shouldn't have to beg people
To care about my son.

41:02.403 --> 41:05.199
I'm gonna take
Some notes.

41:05.199 --> 41:06.345
Tell me what you know,

41:06.345 --> 41:10.180
And if there's something there,
I'll pursue it.

41:10.180 --> 41:14.201
The only thing i ask --
Can you not print my son's name?

41:14.201 --> 41:17.068
I don't have to use
His name.

41:17.068 --> 41:19.014
But this article
Comes out,

41:19.014 --> 41:22.018
It's not gonna be hard
For people to do the math.

41:22.018 --> 41:24.114
They're gonna know
Where it's coming from.

41:24.114 --> 41:26.930
So,
Before you say anything,

41:26.930 --> 41:30.072
Are you sure
You want to go public with this?

41:33.956 --> 41:36.001
Yes. I am.
