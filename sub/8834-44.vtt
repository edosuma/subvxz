01:13.208 --> 01:15.041

01:15.125 --> 01:17.542
They ought to sell souvenir maps.

01:17.625 --> 01:21.709
Last time I got lost for three days.

01:21.792 --> 01:23.709
Makes your head spin.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.458
Hang on, little britches!

[Baloo] Plane Jane!

01:43.166 --> 01:45.709
Airplane Jane to you, Baloo.

01:45.792 --> 01:47.583
Who's Plane Jane?

01:47.667 --> 01:49.542
A pilot I used to know.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.583
Taught her everything she knows.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.291
[Plane Jane] <i>Took about a minute.</i>

01:53.375 --> 01:55.709
<i>I can fly rings around you.</i>

01:55.792 --> 01:59.667
I'd show you some fancy flying,

01:59.750 --> 02:02.458
but I've got a special cargo on board--

02:02.542 --> 02:05.875
For Princess Grace
of Walla Walla Bing Bang.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.500
I'm on a special mission
for Princess Grace.

02:08.583 --> 02:13.125
Do you stand beside her
and make her look good?

02:13.208 --> 02:16.417
We went to finishing school together.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.083
You went to finishing school?

02:19.166 --> 02:21.208
I never finished.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.917
The princess wants me to find something.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.125
She's offering a reward.

02:26.208 --> 02:29.792
I'll tell them you're coming.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.208
<i>They can have the crash crew ready.</i>

02:32.291 --> 02:35.625
I bet she's not as good as you.

02:35.709 --> 02:39.917
She's always trying to prove
she's better than me.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.375
Well, is she?

02:41.458 --> 02:44.458
Well, no. Not really.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.792
She beat me in a race once.

02:48.542 --> 02:51.500
Easy. Let me explain.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.542
<i>We were finalists</i>

02:59.625 --> 03:03.250
<i>in the Armadillo Cook-off and Air Rally.</i>

<i>No sooner did we take off,</i>

03:06.166 --> 03:08.625
<i>than Papa Bear takes the lead.</i>

03:08.709 --> 03:14.208
<i>The trick was to land</i>
<i>and release this armadillo balloon.</i>

03:14.291 --> 03:16.458
<i>I was way ahead,</i>

03:16.542 --> 03:19.375
<i>when she pulls a fast one.</i>

03:32.917 --> 03:35.000
<i>That won the race.</i>

03:37.917 --> 03:40.458
Sounds pretty clever to me.
Why are you so sore?

03:40.542 --> 03:43.208
I wish I'd thought of it.

03:43.291 --> 03:47.375
If I can beat Jane to that reward,

03:47.458 --> 03:50.333
she'll have to admit I'm better.

03:51.709 --> 03:55.375
Come on. We're going to see the queen.

03:55.458 --> 03:59.166

04:58.625 --> 05:01.041
They never laid a hand on me.

05:05.083 --> 05:09.834
I hope the princess
doesn't mind if we drop in.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.083
It's good to see you.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.166
My cousin Prince Wudolf

05:15.250 --> 05:17.458
has returned to Walla Walla Bing Bang

05:17.542 --> 05:21.500

05:31.583 --> 05:34.375
Hang on, Baloo! Got you.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.458
Why do you need me?

05:36.542 --> 05:39.834
[Princess Grace]
The wings were lost centuries ago,

05:39.917 --> 05:43.417
hidden in the caves of the Wockies.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.709
But Wudolf stole the tweasure map.

05:47.792 --> 05:51.000
He keeps it in a safe in his weading woom.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.291

-Whatever.

Sneak in with the guests and find the map.

There's nothing I like
better than a party.

Let's look for costumes.

We'll meet inside by the food.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.959
How will I know you?

07:17.041 --> 07:20.709
I'll be somebody you don't recognize.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.959
I ought to be able to find
something around here.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.208
Now, that's a costume!

Wait! The reading room!

08:50.458 --> 08:52.125
That must've been Plane Jane.

Hold your horses, Baloo.
I got a better idea.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.083
This is the perfect disguise for us.

Hold it. You wouldn't
tell me the right door.

15:23.834 --> 15:27.917
You know I know you wouldn't tell me
the right door,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.291
So this is the right door.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.125
Aah!

15:42.834 --> 15:46.500
He's got rocks in his head,
or will if he stops running.

15:48.125 --> 15:49.583
[lever squeaking]

15:51.709 --> 15:52.709
Aah!

16:05.542 --> 16:08.542
Whew! That was close.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.917
The map says pull the chain.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.000
It could be another trap.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.500
After you.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.375
-[chain jangling]
-[straining] It won't budge!

16:45.458 --> 16:49.208
Out of my way. I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.542
[straining] We need more weight.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.750
[scoffs] Hard to believe.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.917
I hate to say it,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.166
but we got to work together.

16:59.250 --> 17:03.000
All right, but once we pull this chain,

17:03.083 --> 17:04.875
it's every pilot for himself.

17:04.959 --> 17:05.834
Herself.

17:05.916 --> 17:06.875
Whatever.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.541
[scraping]

17:10.165 --> 17:11.916
[crashing]

17:20.541 --> 17:22.666
[Plane Jane] Oh, it's not ruby rings.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.416
It's ruby wings.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.040
Well, why didn't somebody say so?

17:27.125 --> 17:30.125
[Prince Rudolph]
Why, it's perfectwy cwear...

17:30.208 --> 17:36.083
As wong as you speak
Walla Walla Bing Bang.

17:38.250 --> 17:43.667
You've made a fool of Pwince Wudolf
for the last time!

17:48.875 --> 17:49.709
[screaming]

17:53.041 --> 17:54.834
What are you doing?

17:54.917 --> 17:58.000
You don't look like a queen,
but you'll do.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.125
Do what?

17:59.208 --> 18:02.792
With these, glide to the Sea Duck.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.709
Get the wings to Grace
so she can be crowned.

18:06.792 --> 18:09.542
I'm not going to owe you one.

18:09.625 --> 18:12.083
You take them. I'll stay behind.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.792
Don't argue.

18:14.208 --> 18:17.000
I'm too heavy to hang glide.

18:22.917 --> 18:24.834
That door is solid rock.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.083
It'll take them all day
to break through it.

18:33.709 --> 18:36.083
Battery operated.

18:36.625 --> 18:37.542
[gulp]

18:37.625 --> 18:40.375
What have you done with the ruby wings?

18:40.458 --> 18:42.166
Where's your accent?

18:42.250 --> 18:45.583
You're not from Walla Walla Bing Bang.

18:50.959 --> 18:54.625
The princess thinks I'm her
long-lost cousin.

18:54.709 --> 18:58.875
When I stole that map,
I thought I'd steal the treasure,

18:58.959 --> 19:02.959
But I can steal a whole kingdom!

19:03.041 --> 19:06.125
Too late. The wings have flown.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.500
That other pilot must have them.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.417
Throw him out!

19:10.500 --> 19:14.333
[Baloo] I liked him better when
I couldn't understand him.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.000
What do you think of my flying now?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.750
No time for idle compliments.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.750
Let's get to the coronation.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.417
[explosions]

19:42.333 --> 19:45.583
Take the controls. It's your airplane.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.375
You're doing fine.
Fly straight for the blimp.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.417
Stop them! What are they doing
to my blimp?

20:06.500 --> 20:09.458
That ought to let the air
out of that windbag.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.208
Whoa!

20:17.917 --> 20:21.250
We're going down with the blimp!
Cut the rope!

20:35.333 --> 20:37.166
Way to go, Baloo.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.500
That was some flying.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.750
You only forgot one thing...

20:41.834 --> 20:43.083
The rock slide!

20:43.166 --> 20:45.917
[Plane Jane]
We'll never make it on one engine.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.709
Better lose weight.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.291
You mean weights.

20:59.542 --> 21:00.875
[Prince Rudolph and the guards screaming]

21:13.291 --> 21:17.709
Fow wecovewing the fabulous wuby wings
of Queen Mauween,

21:17.792 --> 21:23.542
I pwesent you with the weward of 10,000
Walla Walla Bing Bang wubles!

21:27.125 --> 21:29.166
Hey, what about me?

21:29.250 --> 21:33.417
I pwesent you with a bill
for 10,000 wubles

21:33.500 --> 21:38.375
from the ministwy of souveniws
for destwoying our paperweights.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.625
Ten thousand wubles?

21:40.709 --> 21:44.291
Rebecca's going to kill me
when I get back.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.750
This ought to cover it, Your Gracie.

21:47.834 --> 21:53.000
I never would've found the ruby wings
without you.

21:53.083 --> 21:57.333
I guess I never could've done it
without you.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.667
[laughs] You know,
for a pushy loud-mouthed slob,

22:01.750 --> 22:03.959
you're a pretty nice guy.

22:04.041 --> 22:08.375
Did anybody ever tell you
your eyes sparkle

22:08.458 --> 22:09.917
when you're insulting?

22:10.875 --> 22:12.125
[crashing]

22:12.208 --> 22:15.792
I thought I'd never
get out of that costume.

22:15.875 --> 22:17.834
