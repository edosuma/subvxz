to see basketball superstar
LeBron James'

00:40.775 --> 00:42.508

00:42.510 --> 00:45.644
I would be more the excited
if it were not so late.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.946
We would've been there hours
ago if Cyborg and Beast Boy

00:47.948 --> 00:51.316
hadn't insisted on stopping
for food every five minutes.

over here now.

I'm the manager
of this amusement park,

02:26.447 --> 02:29.314

these days.

Ghouls are, like, scary, man.

than this one,

Ah, they love those

03:13.093 --> 03:15.360
Anyway,
I'd ask the owner for help,

03:15.362 --> 03:19.298
but he stands to make millions
if this place goes under.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.099
Well, that makes no sense.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.634
From the insurance.

That still doesn't
really make sense,

10:58.692 --> 11:01.426
