00:31.264 --> 00:32.731
Everett!

02:29.415 --> 02:30.716
Hey, hey, ooh cookies.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.252
Thanks.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.254
Thank you.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.561
I can't find the nucleus.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.263
Just look a little closer.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.600
Hey, uh, Boris.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.369
The irb rejected our
application, again.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.436
It's okay, Dave.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.506
Excuse me.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.541
Everett.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.442
Hey, Boris.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.646
Well, the prodigal son returns.

03:00.648 --> 03:04.449
Everyone, this is
Everett barnard.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.585
His work was instrumental
in helping us

03:06.587 --> 03:08.320
discover our freeze
drying technique

03:08.322 --> 03:10.722
to extract enzyme from mice.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.592
So work hard, because
if Everett, here,

03:13.594 --> 03:16.461
can be a success,
so can all of you.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.797
Well thanks, I think.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.699
Um, hey, have you
seen doctor crick?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.234
Oh, he got tired of
waiting for you,

03:22.236 --> 03:23.435
so he went up to
the medical floor.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.204
Crap.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.272
Was he angry.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.409
I wouldn't call it
anger necessarily.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.511
Um, okay.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.612
Thank you!

03:36.249 --> 03:38.784
Get back to work, people.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.767
You must really hate that bag.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.408
Lookin' good, Marie.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.443
Thanks.

04:05.778 --> 04:09.881
You look the same.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.583
Same is better than worse.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.853
You still workin' nights?

04:16.356 --> 04:17.356
Yep.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.262
Well, it was nice
seeing you again.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.668
Really? What's changed?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.470
What?

04:31.472 --> 04:32.871
Last time I saw you,
you said you wanted

04:32.873 --> 04:34.373
to focus on your studies.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.611
Yeah, well, you know, that's
not really an issue anymore.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.014
Crick's choosing his
resident this week, and...

04:42.016 --> 04:46.318
You back here for him, or me?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.421
Um...

04:51.025 --> 04:52.791
There.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.859
Now you look better.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.335
That went according to plan.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.940
Right, thanks.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.344
Welcome back, doctor barnard.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.645
Hi, Doris, was
doctor crick here?

05:13.647 --> 05:14.980
Uh, he hasn't been here.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.715
Check the unit?

05:37.870 --> 05:40.439
Not bad for two days out.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.641
Look at that valve, much better.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.576
Is she good to go
to the main floor, though?

05:44.578 --> 05:49.047
Absolutely. A little bit of walking,
no more than 15 minutes a day.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.018
Hey, there you guys are.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.419
Everett, my boy.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.454
Doctor crick.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.456
I recognize that voice.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.790
Hello.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.925
Sorry, I tried calling, but...

05:59.927 --> 06:01.526
Oh, yeah, no, cell tower's down.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.862
- You can't even text.
- Can't even text?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.764
I'm surprised you haven't
killed yourself.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.734
Right, okay, hey, doctor crick.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.068
Uh, again, so sorry I'm late.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.837
I missed you at the lab.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.071
The lab?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.006
I haven't been there yet.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.909
I'm just havin' a look
at my last surgery.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.512
Hey, the hand looks good.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.482
I had a mini-stroke this summer.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.918
But, don't worry, I'm still
looking for a resident.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.787
Yeah.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.756
Why the suicide precautions?

06:30.758 --> 06:32.958
Overdose.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.461
She used her foster dad's
heroin with a dirty needle.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.929
A lot of inflammation
around the heart,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.865
- which is?
- Endocarditis.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.666
There you go.

06:41.668 --> 06:41.666
- On the ball.
- Doctor crick.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.703
You got some orders to
sign on the med floor,

06:44.705 --> 06:46.438
and then you're done.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.540
I will do that.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.443
How does it feel to be chief
resident of main hospital?

06:51.445 --> 06:52.711
There's never a dull moment.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.947
Oh, I'm sure of that.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.850
See you later.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.986
Would you mind taking
care of this for me?

07:00.988 --> 07:01.988
Thank you.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.960
Making friends with crick, huh?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.629
Smart career move, yeah.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.197
Now you guys are chummy.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.532
I'll see you later.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.534
Doctor crick.

07:15.902 --> 07:20.038
Actually, it was my
foster mom's heroin.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.041
Dr. kravitz, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.445
Dr. kravitz, a visitor
in the main lobby.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.915
Aging is a disease.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.218
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

07:33.220 --> 07:37.222
Yeah, it's a disease
with no cure, though.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.591
- Guess what
- hello.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.461
I'm Brittany, here to watch
over a miss Sarah Hanna.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.095
Watch over, what's that?

07:44.097 --> 07:47.132
A sitter, suicide prevention.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
They re bringing her
over from the unit.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.536
What's in the bag?

07:51.538 --> 07:54.172
Oh, things to cheer Sarah up.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.174
See?

07:59.512 --> 08:00.712
See?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.113
Don't try to cheer her up.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.182
All you do is watch her.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.218
Well, I can most
certainly do that.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.886
That remains to be seen.

08:10.022 --> 08:13.592
Alice, can you set
Brittany up, please?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.794
I most certainly can do that.

08:15.796 --> 08:19.197
Hold on, Barbie,
I'll be right back.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.933
Should I tell her that
my name's Brittany?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.902
Why not?

08:23.904 --> 08:26.137
Assert yourself, Brittany.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.073
Code blue!
Morelli again!

08:30.276 --> 08:32.577
No, no, no, hey, hey.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.514
Relax, relax, it
happens every day.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.216
Oh. Yeah.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.284
Yeah.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.526
- No pulse, he's uh, uh.
- Start baggin' him.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.227
Open up the iv, get
those paddles ready.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.629
Charged. 360.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.599
- Hey, Everett.
- The gel.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.037
- Uh, charge it.
- Everyone, clear.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.138
Clear!

09:04.043 --> 09:05.777
Still v-fib, hit him again.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.099
- No, shouldn't we use some epi first?
- No, hit him again!

09:12.553 --> 09:13.553
Excuse me.

09:14.987 --> 09:15.987
Charged?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.055
Charged.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.095
Okay, we got a
sinus rhythm back.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.163
Let's stabilize him.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.207
You're making progress.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.143
Only two shocks this time.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.312
Sorry, doctor crick, I'm...

09:40.314 --> 09:42.681
It's your first day
back, come on.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.323
Besides, doctor jenner's
a bit of a prick.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.952
It's not her fault.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.020
Don't be so hard on yourself.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.356
Come on, you know how
far you've come?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.692
Yeah, I can freeze mice.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.660
I don't know, maybe I
need a totem animal

09:55.662 --> 09:56.861
like the jellyfish.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.730
But, why the jellyfish, doctor?

09:58.732 --> 09:59.998
What do you wanna know?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.266
Well I wanna know,

10:01.268 --> 10:02.801
what appeals to you about it?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.102
A jellyfish is the only creature

10:04.104 --> 10:05.704
on earth that lives forever.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.738
What? Immortality?

10:06.740 --> 10:07.772
Oh, yes.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.741
They start the size of a polyp,

10:09.743 --> 10:11.910
they grow up full
size, and back down

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
to the size of a polyp, and
they keep recycling that way.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.880
Hmm.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.750
And they are immortal,
unless a sea turtle

10:18.752 --> 10:20.919
eats them or they wash ashore.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.621
Well, I don't know
about sea turtles,

10:22.623 --> 10:24.255
but I certainly know
about being washed up.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.859
Everett, there are many
smart and talented people

10:27.861 --> 10:30.729
that never get a
whiff of greatness.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.264
'Cause greatness
requires two things,

10:33.266 --> 10:37.268
a fire in the belly, and the
willingness to see it through.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.871
You have the fire in the belly.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.740
Let's see if you have the will.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.221
Yeah!

11:13.039 --> 11:14.939
Do you want the same password?

11:17.276 --> 11:18.376
Look away, please.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.719
You are a woman of many talents.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.426
When do I get paid
for my talents?

11:34.428 --> 11:35.927
You got quite a
mouth on you, kid.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.929
I mean it.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.469
You know what
else my mouth's good at?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.704
What's that?

11:45.706 --> 11:46.706
Talking.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.110
You know, I've very glad

11:52.112 --> 11:53.445
that I made you the
chief resident.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.346
You've done well.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.948
I would hate to see
how hard your job

11:56.950 --> 11:58.416
would be with something
pressed against you.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.385
What would that be, Raymond?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.888
Charges, tampering,
hipaa violations,

12:05.224 --> 12:08.193
enough to land your
pretty little ass in jail.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.195
So I would try to keep
that talented mouth shut.

12:18.738 --> 12:23.041
Just some computer
work, nothing more.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.211
Oh, you tryin' to draw
attention to yourself?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.293
Drawing attention?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.216
Oh, you mean like
with Abe wilks.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.951
Abe wilks?

12:32.953 --> 12:36.321
Yes, your most recent
harvest victim.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.123
His widow's lawyer
wants to know why

12:38.125 --> 12:39.991
an otherwise healthy
48 year old dies

12:39.993 --> 12:42.961
after a routine procedure and
then has an unauthorized autopsy.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.163
Well, I authorized it.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.965
- That's funny.
- It is.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.067
Maybe you can tell their
attorneys that yourself

12:49.069 --> 12:50.902
when they get here tomorrow.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.338
What? They're coming here?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.473
We had an agreement, Alex.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.443
Only those patients who
were dying at that moment.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.779
Well, the official
cause of death

13:00.781 --> 13:02.313
is a fatal arrhythmia.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.183
The EKG backs that up.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.918
We're in the clear.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.453
So if that all...

13:08.455 --> 13:12.090
You forgot that
I golf with Darren.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.128
Oh, shit.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.400
I've been nursing this
along with baby steps.

13:22.402 --> 13:22.400
You wanted to kill Abe wilks,

13:22.402 --> 13:26.204
extract enough enzyme for
Darren to mass produce for you,

13:26.206 --> 13:28.940
and then you're gonna screw me out of
the largest pharma deal in history.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.042
What would you like?
50/50.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.210
You're done here.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.511
60/40.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.346
- I protected you.
- 70/30.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.849
I covered your ass for seven
years, I even let you build a...

13:37.851 --> 13:40.251
Please!
Please, don't do this.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.953
I'm the one that
made this happen.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.121
I made you happen!

14:05.411 --> 14:08.246
Okay, everyone, we're gonna
close the lab early today.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.248
Really?

14:10.416 --> 14:13.484
Let's go, go home
and have some fun.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.420
This is how we have fun.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.368
Hey, Ginny, I need that back.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.870
I'll be done in a moment.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.371
- What are you doing?
- I'll be done in a moment.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.939
I just need to
input some orders.

14:34.941 --> 14:37.375
I'll be done in a
moment, nurse Blackwell.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.598
Hey.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.933
Hi.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.368
What's that?

15:03.370 --> 15:06.037
I grabbed what I could
from your office.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.306
And I got the new
remote access codes.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.108
I also found this.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.143
Have a look at this
right now, please.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.482
When was this uploaded?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.117
Today.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.085
He has files on all
of our subjects.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.288
Even surveillance video.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.356
That slimy son of a bitch.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.558
He wants my enzyme.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.693
What do you mean?

15:30.230 --> 15:33.331
Abe wilks's widow is coming in

15:33.333 --> 15:34.933
with a lawyer tomorrow
to meet with ray.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.100
He's gonna show 'em this,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.602
gonna ask like he's
just discovered it.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.370
And throw you under the bus.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.675
Us, Boris?

15:46.979 --> 15:50.081
What are we gonna do?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.083
We gotta stop legro.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.585
He put this up on
the network, okay.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.654
Somebody else is
gonna find this.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.190
Oh, shit.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.993
Wait a minute, crick.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.528
All this construction,
we've been offline today.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.363
Yeah?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.965
These files won't get
uploaded until we

16:06.967 --> 16:09.667
go back online tomorrow
morning at 6:00 A.M.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.337
So we have tonight.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.639
Our new passwords give
us limited access, okay?

16:14.641 --> 16:18.576
We get alarms, doors, power.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.378
But we're not gonna
get into the network

16:20.380 --> 16:22.180
to change medical files.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.116
We have to destroy the network.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.154
There's something else.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.689
What?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.257
We can't get any
enzyme from wilks.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.593
Apparently he had two prior mis.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.196
You didn't know that wilks
had a couple of heart attacks.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.999
It wasn't in his file, and
it wasn't in his physical.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.370
We are so close.

16:45.372 --> 16:49.207
We just need one more subject
to extract enzyme from.

16:50.642 --> 16:51.642
Legro.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.247
Well that'd kill two
birds with one stone.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.249
Mm-hmm.

17:00.519 --> 17:05.390
You know what happens when
you're stung by a jellyfish?

17:05.392 --> 17:09.359
There's pain and then paralysis.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.251
Hey, Brittany.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.220
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.256
What-what's-what's wrong?

17:38.258 --> 17:41.092
She is, she's all wrong.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.450
Sarah.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.484
Shh.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.541
Uh, well, I'm doctor barnard.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.543
I remember you.

18:32.711 --> 18:33.711
Yeah.

18:36.281 --> 18:40.218
Yeah, so, what did
you do to Brittany?

18:40.220 --> 18:44.622
She asked me if I would
accept Jesus into my heart.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.858
Really, what'd you tell her?

18:46.860 --> 18:49.227
An honest and deeply
religious answer.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.763
Oh, I see.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.765
How long will I
be strapped here?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.901
The straps are part of
our suicide precautions,

18:56.903 --> 18:58.736
much like Brittany.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.872
Brittany is a cause of
suicide, not a precaution.

19:00.874 --> 19:05.176
So I have to ask,
do you still want,

19:05.178 --> 19:07.712
do you think, Do you wanna be

19:07.714 --> 19:09.313
a part of the world, our world?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.282
Use grown up words.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.417
Okay, how do you feel?

19:13.419 --> 19:15.253
Please rephrase the question

19:15.255 --> 19:17.188
so a concrete
answer is possible.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.623
Okay, do you still
wanna kill yourself?

19:18.625 --> 19:20.291
Not until you walked in.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.296
I'm putting that
down as progress.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.469
South union cardiac er.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.710
Thank you.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.650
Doc.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.355
What? This patient
needs isolation?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.649
You're no guiding light, flem.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.351
They take out the
trash every Tuesday.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.652
Who's the resident on tonight?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.753
Doctor jenner.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.522
She the one sleepin' with legro?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.424
I don't know, you
want me to ask her?

20:26.426 --> 20:28.226
Uh, no.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.561
Get her to handle this junkie.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.772
How'd you get that?

20:41.774 --> 20:43.307
Crack pipe blow up in your face?

20:50.617 --> 20:51.949
I have to make an appointment

20:51.951 --> 20:53.551
to see the cardiologist?

20:53.553 --> 20:55.286
Okay, do you have insurance?

20:55.288 --> 20:56.887
Yes, Michigan
blue cross blue shield.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.458
- Okay, that should be a $200 copay.
- Okay.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.793
Okay, we will get back
with you in a couple days,

21:02.795 --> 21:04.328
and give you an appointment.

21:04.330 --> 21:04.328
Sounds good, thank you.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.431
- Okay, have a great day.
- You too.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.605
My heart gently weeps.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.444
You know, I was a dancer once.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.013
Square dancer?

21:22.015 --> 21:26.684
Ballet in Michigan, then
New York for four years.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.753
What happened?

21:28.755 --> 21:29.920
Fell in love with my director.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.455
That's not good.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.360
He likes to push
people as hard as he can.

21:36.362 --> 21:39.697
And I, being naive,
did anything he wanted.

21:39.699 --> 21:40.798
He pushed, and he pushed.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.966
Until you broke.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.968
No...

21:44.770 --> 21:47.338
Yeah, I guess.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.743
Are you aware of what crick did?

21:54.846 --> 21:58.549
He replaced the
infected aortic valve.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.951
That's the same valve that
stopped you from dancing.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.553
The one with the birth defect.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.754
Right.

22:03.756 --> 22:04.989
So when crick
replaced the valve,

22:04.991 --> 22:07.558
he treated both your problems.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.394
Really, so it's all good now?

22:10.396 --> 22:11.796
As long as it heals properly.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.764
Should it?

22:13.766 --> 22:14.766
It should.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.772
Wait, so you're saying
that if this heals

22:21.774 --> 22:24.075
I can dance again.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.777
Square dancing, at
the very least.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.922
Oh, uh, hi Marie.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.056
What are you doing?

22:41.560 --> 22:42.827
I-I just needed some gauze.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.801
Anything taken must be logged.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.503
Gotcha.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.041
You know, we have some
exciting new developments

22:57.043 --> 22:59.977
happening in the lab?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.979
I could show you some
time, if your free.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.013
I don't think so.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.007
South union cardiac er.

23:31.877 --> 23:35.913
No, sir, we don't
except that insurance.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.915
No, sir, I can't
prescribe morphine.

23:39.951 --> 23:43.621
No, sir, I will not go to hell.

23:48.827 --> 23:49.827
Hey.

23:49.829 --> 23:50.995
Hmm.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.563
You already got your residency.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.499
You can stop studying now.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.867
Not after this morning, I can't.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.002
Yes you can.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.136
See one, do one, teach one.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.005
That's how you learn.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.941
See one, do one, teach one?

24:03.943 --> 24:06.477
Yeah, like you and Marie.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.579
See one, do one

24:08.581 --> 24:09.713
we broke up months ago, okay?

24:09.715 --> 24:10.815
Dump one.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.882
Okay.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.651
Sorry, sorry.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.920
I did not dump her, okay?

24:15.922 --> 24:20.858
I told her that I wanted
to focus more on medicine.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.862
You, oh, okay, why not just

24:24.864 --> 24:26.864
cheat on her and post
the video on Facebook?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.132
That would have
been more humane.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.767
Hey, suddenly doctor
freeze over there

24:29.769 --> 24:31.635
is talking about being humane?

24:31.637 --> 24:34.772
You dumped her to study more.

24:34.774 --> 24:38.642
I mean, at least a guy who's
cheating is sexually active.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.145
Hey, I'm way sexually
active, okay?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.180
And you're the only woman I
know who's defending cheating.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.782
I'm not, I'm just
saying that that's,

24:44.784 --> 24:46.550
like, the worst possible
reason to dump somebody.

24:46.552 --> 24:47.785
But it's true.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.687
You know what's true?

24:49.689 --> 24:50.888
You totally dumped
her 'cause you

24:50.890 --> 24:52.189
wanted to get closer to crick,

24:52.191 --> 24:54.859
and that is so beyond deranged.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.994
And now you're defending
her which is another first.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.029
No, this isn't about him or her.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.499
It's about you and
your ambitions.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.968
If you want cardiology so badly,

25:03.970 --> 25:07.905
why not just apply to a
program like at main hospital?

25:07.907 --> 25:10.574
Look, crick's just a surgeon.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.843
And this hospital is so small.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.046
I had an academic
hearing two years ago.

25:16.048 --> 25:19.149
They wanted to expel
me, kick my ass out.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.751
You didn't tell me that.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.653
Yeah, well, I
didn't tell anyone.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.759
And during the hearing I
was too scared to speak,

25:28.761 --> 25:30.160
to scared to defend myself.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.833
But, crick defended me.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.968
He was there.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.770
He see's something
in me, in my work,

25:39.772 --> 25:41.572
that no one else does, so.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.141
You know, you don't
owe crick anything.

25:46.311 --> 25:47.645
Wait, what is that?

25:48.315 --> 25:49.214
Oh.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.882
Me and Marie from this morning?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.717
Yeah, it's hilarious.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.819
Yeah, ha ha ha.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.688
What, legro allows
you to do that?

25:57.690 --> 25:58.923
Well, no, he's not really

25:58.925 --> 26:00.791
in a position to
allow me anything.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.560
Right, what, because uh,

26:02.562 --> 26:04.094
your favorite
position is on top?

26:05.698 --> 26:07.231
Excuse me?

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Really?

26:11.102 --> 26:12.703
No, come on, say it.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.238
- No, okay, sorry.
- Say it. I know you want to.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.040
- No, I didn't mean you and legro.
- Call me a whore.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.075
No, jeez, Ginny, come on.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.677
Look, I don't see
him anymore, okay?

26:19.679 --> 26:20.679
Okay.

27:21.873 --> 27:23.173
Can I help you?

27:25.810 --> 27:26.810
James.

27:28.847 --> 27:32.950
James Ross. My,
how you've grown.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.221
I hate to do this to you, son.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.102
Looking good.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.370
Really?

27:53.372 --> 27:54.838
Knock knock.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
Hey.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.378
Just checkin' in.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.847
Thanks, we're all set.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.250
Crick cancel the restraints?

28:06.252 --> 28:08.185
She's not suicidal.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.420
Did you talk to crick?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.926
Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

28:15.928 --> 28:17.995
Sarah, I'll be right back, okay?

28:25.203 --> 28:26.737
She doesn't need restraints.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.005
Doesn't matter, it's
cricks patient.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.073
- She.
- What?

28:29.075 --> 28:30.774
She's crick's patient.

28:30.776 --> 28:33.444
Listen, I am not the dick, here.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.446
You listen, if she really wanted

28:35.448 --> 28:37.014
to kill herself she
would've done it.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.315
She's fine.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.017
Fine does not capture her.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.485
Have you ever lost
anything important to you?

28:41.487 --> 28:42.986
- Yes.
- Really?

28:42.988 --> 28:44.021
- Yes.
- What?

28:44.023 --> 28:45.222
I lost you.

28:48.159 --> 28:50.794
Screw your bullshit
romance lines.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.863
You dumped me, remember.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.800
Let's just calm down, I
don't wanna have a fight.

28:56.802 --> 28:58.435
Yeah, that's right, Everett.

28:58.437 --> 29:01.271
You never wanna
fight, for anything.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.981
I'd like to accept this award...

29:13.151 --> 29:15.452
Uh, no good.

29:15.454 --> 29:20.290
I'd like to accept this
nobel prize for man...

29:20.292 --> 29:24.762
I'd like to accept this
nobel prize for mankind.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.436
One small step for man.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.305
I accept this, humbly.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.142
I accept it all in all...

29:38.144 --> 29:40.043
Humanity.

29:40.045 --> 29:43.781
I hope there's a pony at the
bottom of all that bullshit.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.984
I would like to accept
this nobel prize for me,

29:46.986 --> 29:49.319
and all my friends,
my mommy, my daddy.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.222
I would like to, I would
like to accept this award.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.158
I don't want your fuckin' award.

30:52.851 --> 30:57.120
Figures, those cheap bastards
forgot to pay the bills.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.156
I think this
computer still works.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.960
I thought you ladies
might like a warm beverage.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.461
Um, thanks, you didn't have to.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.896
It used to be your favorite.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.397
So were you, once.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.100
I have to go

31:10.102 --> 31:11.268
- check on the patients.
- Uh, Sarah

31:11.270 --> 31:12.469
would like more ice chips,

31:12.471 --> 31:14.271
morelli is due for his meds,

31:14.273 --> 31:18.041
and I am gonna go check on
the rest of the unit, so...

31:18.043 --> 31:20.477
Everett.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.081
I'm sorry about earlier.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.383
Oh, uh, it's, it's okay.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.585
Actually taught me a
very important lesson.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.587
What?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.155
That you still care.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.027
Like, a lot.

32:46.431 --> 32:47.464
He's ready, Alex.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.500
Alex.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.072
Alex, are you all right?

33:01.479 --> 33:02.479
Yeah.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.250
I'm all right, now that my
good buddy, ray, is here.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.320
Alex, where the hell am I.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.490
You're in my private
underground lab.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.425
That you never wanted
to know anything about.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.760
Is this what you
build with my money?

33:16.762 --> 33:18.495
Years of grants.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.499
Now it's time for you to pay.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.401
You think torturing
me is gonna help you?

33:24.403 --> 33:26.503
Well, it sure isn't
gonna help you.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.210
Have you lost your mind?

33:33.212 --> 33:35.145
Get me off of this
table right now.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.247
Ray, don't worry, I'm gonna

33:37.249 --> 33:39.282
fill out your organ donor card.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.452
Alex, what are you doing?

33:45.423 --> 33:48.191
Goddamn lunatic,
let me outta here!

33:48.193 --> 33:49.493
Get me off of this table!

33:52.030 --> 33:53.630
Let me out!

33:53.632 --> 33:55.732
Let me outta here, you
twisted sick bastard!

33:55.734 --> 33:58.168
God damn lunatic.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.303
Get me off of this table!

34:00.305 --> 34:01.671
Get me off of this
god damn table!

34:01.673 --> 34:02.739
Shut him up, will ya?

34:02.741 --> 34:04.474
Alex! Let me out!

34:23.728 --> 34:24.728
Oh.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.634
Ray's gonna miss his tee time.

35:04.469 --> 35:08.271
Mommy's fine, James.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.673
It's just a little surgery.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.643
I'll never leave you, sweety.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.149
You have a special
voice inside of you.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.455
I love you so very much.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.791
It's all right, James.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.326
It's all right.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.431
It's all right.

35:46.911 --> 35:47.911
It's all right.

36:08.533 --> 36:11.468
Alice, mister morelli
keeps hitting his button.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.869
I'm getting his suppositories.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.337
He doesn't get suppositories.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.705
He does now.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.675
Okay.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.684
Still alive, mister morelli?

36:29.554 --> 36:33.290
Got your poopers and
your sleepers here.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.525
If I shock you again,
it'll be between your legs.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.527
Wake up.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.525
No.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
God, oh no.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.378
Why?

37:38.889 --> 37:40.624
Hello?

37:40.626 --> 37:41.992
Everett.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.361
Hey, what's goin' on?

37:44.363 --> 37:46.596
He killed everyone in the er.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.732
A psycho in scrubs attacked me
and killed everybody in the er.

37:48.734 --> 37:49.733
Okay.

37:49.735 --> 37:50.734
And now we're locked in.

37:50.736 --> 37:51.768
No, we're still...

37:51.770 --> 37:53.703
He has Flemming's
coat and an ID.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.372
He could come in
here any second.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.440
No he can't, he needs the code.
He doesn't have the code.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.776
I tried to get out,
but he locked us all in.

37:59.778 --> 38:00.944
Okay, okay.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.013
Here, stay still.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.487
No bars, shit.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.521
Where's your phone?

38:11.523 --> 38:14.891
Uh, right. Oh god.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.060
Okay, shit, I've lost it.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.995
Okay.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.831
He had a scar on his
face and a surgical mask.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.033
Okay.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.467
Ginny, Ginny, look at me.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.735
Look at me, okay?

38:25.737 --> 38:27.037
We're gonna be okay.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.905
We have to get out of here.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.041
We have to find a way
out of here, okay?

38:31.043 --> 38:32.475
Okay, let's go.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.710
Wait, where are you going?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.078
If he can't come in
here, I'm not leaving.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.746
- We can't stay here all night.
- Yes we can!

38:36.748 --> 38:38.014
No, Ginny, we cannot.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.849
Yes we can, Everett.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.618
Wait, you said that,
uh, he's going to the er,

38:41.620 --> 38:43.553
then the unit, that means, shit.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.523
Everett, where are you going?

39:34.004 --> 39:35.004
Alice?

39:38.442 --> 39:39.943
Alice, I need your pass code.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.096
Marie!

41:30.120 --> 41:31.120
Hey.

41:33.257 --> 41:35.191
You think your mommy's
proud of you?

41:37.561 --> 41:39.062
Did your mommy even love you?

41:41.499 --> 41:42.765
Mine left me all alone.

41:46.770 --> 41:48.271
My mommy broke my heart, too.

41:50.541 --> 41:51.541
See.

41:54.612 --> 41:55.612
So, go ahead.

41:56.947 --> 42:02.218
Hit me, hurt me, tear me apart.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.857
But, I won't scream for you.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.927
And it won't bring
your mommy back.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.078
So, how's it look?

42:29.080 --> 42:31.314
He had a defibrillator.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.082
Oh, Jesus.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.086
Well, we can't use that.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.322
Legro is a cold
hearted son of a bitch.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.990
He's dead.

42:40.992 --> 42:41.992
You know what?

42:45.763 --> 42:46.763
Yeah.

42:51.736 --> 42:55.572
Uh, we gotta deal with that.

42:55.574 --> 42:56.806
That won't do.

43:17.329 --> 43:18.329
That's better.

43:40.217 --> 43:41.818
Over here.

43:41.820 --> 43:42.820
Here.

43:45.155 --> 43:48.057
Ginny, come help Sarah.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.225
- Ginny!
- What?

43:54.765 --> 43:56.032
You're bleeding, okay.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.668
It's fine. Leave it.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.971
Okay, what do we do now?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.172
Fine here?

44:03.174 --> 44:05.942
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.744
He never flinched.

44:07.746 --> 44:10.079
What?

44:10.081 --> 44:14.117
When I choked him, I
crushed his throat.

44:14.119 --> 44:15.652
It's like he didn't
feel anything.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.088
Oh god, your back.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.990
- Are you bleeding?
- I know.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.397
How are you feeling?

44:27.399 --> 44:30.366
Like my chest is splitting
open ever time I try to breath.

44:30.368 --> 44:33.703
What you did up
there was amazing.

44:33.705 --> 44:38.207
I, how, how did you even
think to ask about his mom?

44:38.209 --> 44:41.277
Most serial killers
have dominant

44:41.279 --> 44:44.947
or over protective mothers who

44:44.949 --> 44:49.252
overcompensate for
distant or absent fathers.

44:49.254 --> 44:51.120
Oh, is that right?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.823
Childhood trauma is
usually involved.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.458
The scar on his face.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.427
Hold on a minute.

44:57.429 --> 45:00.163
You stood in front of him
and made him attack you?

45:00.165 --> 45:01.831
She distracted him.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.032
Ginny, what are you doing?

45:03.034 --> 45:04.400
Just making a point.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.436
That suicidal behavior, no
matter how genius it is,

45:06.438 --> 45:09.005
it still leads to suicide.

45:09.007 --> 45:10.473
Your voice leads to suicide.

45:34.832 --> 45:36.899
The attack separated
her incision,

45:36.901 --> 45:38.735
causing internal bleeding
around her lungs,

45:38.737 --> 45:40.503
and probably around her heart.

45:40.505 --> 45:42.238
A hemothorax.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.407
Yeah.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.310
She'll continue to bleed,
and her lungs will collapse,

45:47.312 --> 45:49.445
she'll go into shock
and die here on our bench.

45:49.447 --> 45:51.414
Ginny, stop, what are you doing?

45:51.416 --> 45:53.316
Just a synopsis.

45:53.318 --> 45:55.351
Are there any useful
supplies here?

45:57.421 --> 45:58.788
Marie, wait!

45:58.790 --> 46:00.356
- Get outta my way!
- What are you doing?

46:00.358 --> 46:01.858
I'm not just gonna sit here.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.793
Are you crazy? He could be
right outside the door.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.361
At least he's not hiding
in a corner like you!

46:05.363 --> 46:06.362
Fuck you!

46:06.364 --> 46:07.897
Calm down, please.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.398
I'm calm.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.168
I'm not just gonna sit
here and watch her die.

46:12.170 --> 46:14.170
I'm the physician here,
and I say we stay put.

46:14.172 --> 46:15.438
Don't pull rank, resident!

46:15.440 --> 46:17.039
We don't have a choice!

46:17.041 --> 46:18.908
- There's always a choice!
- If we leave, we'll die!

46:18.910 --> 46:21.177
- If we stay, she'll die!
- Fine!

46:24.047 --> 46:25.381
What kind of a doctor are you?

46:25.383 --> 46:27.350
The bitch kind.

46:27.352 --> 46:28.352
I'm just being practical.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.887
Is that what you tell legro?

46:30.889 --> 46:32.388
Go rot in hell, Amazon!

46:32.390 --> 46:33.390
Stop!

46:36.860 --> 46:38.961
We're done arguing.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.463
We all leave, so we all live.

46:41.999 --> 46:43.366
Now, we need medical
supplies for Sarah

46:43.368 --> 46:45.001
and a way out of here.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.436
You've worked her for years,
so you find an escape route.

46:47.438 --> 46:48.538
I'll get supplies.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.439
You, stay alive.

46:50.441 --> 46:51.841
Yeah, I get the hard part.

46:51.843 --> 46:53.409
Ginny, see if you can
get the computer

46:53.411 --> 46:55.211
on an outlet somewhere,
get a message out of here.

46:55.213 --> 46:57.380
- Everett, I don't think that I...
- You will manage the patient,

46:57.382 --> 46:58.948
or you will wait in the hallway.

46:58.950 --> 46:59.950
Your choice.

47:01.451 --> 47:02.518
Are you serious?

47:04.955 --> 47:06.422
You need stitches.

47:06.424 --> 47:08.291
There's no time.

47:08.293 --> 47:11.527
You're bleeding,
there's time, in the room.

47:11.529 --> 47:12.529
Ouch.

47:58.642 --> 48:01.477
Hacks from chopping up tissue,

48:01.479 --> 48:03.446
tossing it in a blender,
and calling it research.

48:05.116 --> 48:07.216
The answer to
the whole thing is to prevent...

48:07.218 --> 48:07.216
Perhaps.

48:07.218 --> 48:14.156
My data is as valid
as my colleague's.

48:14.158 --> 48:17.093
Shoot me, somebody, shoot me.

48:17.095 --> 48:18.527
I've never had a
problem with the irb,

48:18.529 --> 48:20.029
so I really couldn't say.

48:22.366 --> 48:24.100
We got a big problem.

48:24.102 --> 48:25.902
What?

48:25.904 --> 48:27.203
We don't have any
viable subjects.

48:27.205 --> 48:29.438
Why?

48:29.440 --> 48:32.541
James isn't paralyzing
them, he's killing them.

48:32.543 --> 48:33.543
What?

48:37.314 --> 48:40.216
Listen, what the hell
are we gonna do?

48:44.354 --> 48:45.354
We need her.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.090
Her.

48:51.128 --> 48:53.095
I'm counting on you.

49:10.247 --> 49:12.081
I only have enough
lido for one cut.

49:12.083 --> 49:13.083
Just do it.

49:27.965 --> 49:29.065
Sorry.

49:29.067 --> 49:30.067
Here.

49:44.214 --> 49:45.514
Better?

49:45.516 --> 49:46.516
Uh, yeah.

49:48.452 --> 49:49.452
Oh, wait.

49:57.427 --> 49:59.495
Uh, okay. Um

50:01.398 --> 50:03.599
get ready for the
Lidocaine train.

50:03.601 --> 50:05.534
I'm not five, just do it.

50:05.536 --> 50:09.372
Attitude like that, you
are not gonna get a lollipop.

50:16.646 --> 50:17.713
Doin' okay?

50:17.715 --> 50:18.781
- I'm fine.
- Mm-hm.

50:18.783 --> 50:20.182
I just hate needles.

50:34.364 --> 50:35.364
Hey doc?

50:37.300 --> 50:39.668
Is my incision
supposed to do this?

50:46.777 --> 50:47.777
I didn't think so.

50:59.424 --> 51:00.556
Sorry.

51:04.528 --> 51:05.828
Do you know why I was so mad

51:05.830 --> 51:08.064
when you broke up with me?

51:08.066 --> 51:10.766
'Cause I was gonna dump you.

51:10.768 --> 51:12.635
Do know how angry that made me?

51:15.672 --> 51:17.139
I do actually.

51:17.141 --> 51:18.141
Really?

51:19.342 --> 51:22.578
Remember my sister, Jennifer?

51:22.580 --> 51:23.746
Married the football coach.

51:23.748 --> 51:25.548
Yeah.

51:25.550 --> 51:28.751
Coach bishop, from alpine
state. Not tom coach bishop.

51:28.753 --> 51:32.221
Coach bishop, what a tool.

51:32.223 --> 51:34.190
And when you first met him,

51:34.192 --> 51:35.357
he's like, "call
me coach bishop,"

51:35.359 --> 51:36.625
you're like, "whatever, Tommy."

51:38.362 --> 51:40.196
I almost objected
during their wedding.

51:40.198 --> 51:42.431
I would have, too, if
you hadn't stopped me.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.133
Stand up, objection.

51:45.469 --> 51:46.702
Sustained.

51:46.704 --> 51:47.803
Wedding dismissed.

51:49.207 --> 51:50.806
Sorry.

51:50.808 --> 51:55.578
Well, Jen finally got her
divorce papers together,

51:55.580 --> 51:57.179
but coach served her first.

51:58.815 --> 52:02.318
He divorced her, after
all the arrests,

52:02.320 --> 52:04.520
the rehab, the...

52:04.522 --> 52:06.689
The driving naked through
the in-n-out drive-thru.

52:06.691 --> 52:07.823
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

52:09.694 --> 52:10.893
Wow.

52:10.895 --> 52:12.595
Yeah, wow.

52:19.503 --> 52:22.538
Uh, he, uh, served her at work.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.141
She's a school teacher.

52:25.143 --> 52:26.642
Second grade.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.248
If you ever did
that to me, I would kill you.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.450
I believe you.

52:34.452 --> 52:36.519
Don't patronize me, I'm serious.

52:37.888 --> 52:40.489
I would never doubt
your sincerity.

52:46.696 --> 52:47.696
Ever.

52:51.234 --> 52:52.568
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

52:54.538 --> 52:55.638
Don't do it again.

52:58.575 --> 53:00.776
How's the pap smear goin', huh?

53:00.778 --> 53:02.645
He's so holistic.

53:02.647 --> 53:06.348
Come on, I got
somethin' to show you.

53:33.743 --> 53:35.444
James Ross.

53:35.446 --> 53:36.446
That's his name.

53:37.581 --> 53:39.682
Can you pull up any
surveillance video?

53:39.684 --> 53:41.517
No, there's only a few cameras.

53:41.519 --> 53:43.519
It's weird.

53:43.521 --> 53:45.921
It's like, like the power was
cut from inside the building.

53:45.923 --> 53:47.756
There has to be someone
helping from the outside.

53:47.758 --> 53:48.958
Why do you say that?

53:48.960 --> 53:50.359
The fire alarm went
off right when

53:50.361 --> 53:51.560
I had James under control.

53:51.562 --> 53:52.728
That could be a coincidence.

53:52.730 --> 53:53.996
Then where are the firetrucks,

53:53.998 --> 53:55.631
and why isn't the alarm
still going off?

53:55.633 --> 53:57.533
Okay, good point.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.902
I also uploaded a bunch
of files, today,

53:59.904 --> 54:02.371
for legro, and they all
had crick's name on them.

54:02.373 --> 54:03.739
I'm gonna try look at those.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.341
Why, what's the point of that?

54:05.343 --> 54:06.809
Because legro was
killed on a day

54:06.811 --> 54:08.811
when he uploaded
files for crick.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.546
Cop shows call it a motive.

54:12.250 --> 54:13.250
Let's go.

54:16.386 --> 54:18.387
Everett, wait.

54:18.389 --> 54:19.955
Take this in case
you get a signal,

54:19.957 --> 54:21.724
and don't break it.

54:21.726 --> 54:23.692
They only give me one.

54:23.694 --> 54:24.694
Wait.

54:25.862 --> 54:27.329
Be careful.

54:27.331 --> 54:29.331
We will, thanks.

54:34.437 --> 54:35.437
Oh baby.

54:38.575 --> 54:39.642
I'll meet you back here.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.010
Yeah. Wait.

54:45.348 --> 54:46.348
No, sorry.

54:59.362 --> 55:01.297
Okay.

55:07.537 --> 55:08.537
Fuck.

56:11.134 --> 56:12.134
Sarah?

56:14.437 --> 56:15.437
Sarah?

56:38.661 --> 56:41.730
Ah! Oh, Jesus, Marie!

56:41.732 --> 56:43.799
What are you doing here?

56:43.801 --> 56:47.569
I'm so glad it's you, I

56:47.571 --> 56:49.705
That thing attacked
me up in the lab,

56:49.707 --> 56:51.807
and I came down here and hid.

56:51.809 --> 56:53.509
How have you survived?

56:53.511 --> 56:55.010
I haven't survived yet.

57:07.458 --> 57:09.525
Sarah, Sarah?

57:11.494 --> 57:13.095
Shit.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.463
Sarah.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.533
Where does that lead to?

57:17.535 --> 57:19.868
Nowhere, uh, that's a dead end,

57:19.870 --> 57:21.970
you don't wanna go that way.

57:21.972 --> 57:26.442
Um, listen, you and I should
stick together, you know?

57:26.444 --> 57:30.179
It's like
there's safety in numbers.

57:30.181 --> 57:31.847
For me or for you?

57:33.484 --> 57:35.451
Always with that dry wit.

57:35.453 --> 57:38.520
Sorry.

57:38.522 --> 57:40.889
I think Everett and our dying
patient are eager to leave.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.591
Everett.

57:42.593 --> 57:44.793
Everett, he's here?

57:44.795 --> 57:47.129
Yeah, why?

57:47.131 --> 57:49.131
Uh, nothin', I'm just,
I'm glad he's safe.

57:49.133 --> 57:50.199
Okay.

57:50.201 --> 57:52.601
Wait. Hey, Marie.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.670
Let me ask you somethin'.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.738
What do you see in him?

57:56.740 --> 57:57.740
Excuse me?

57:59.108 --> 58:01.076
You're smart, you're beautiful,

58:01.078 --> 58:03.645
you're hard working,
and he dumped you.

58:05.248 --> 58:06.815
You know, I'd never do that.

58:08.519 --> 58:10.486
This conversation's over.

58:10.488 --> 58:12.554
Don't walk away from me!

58:28.505 --> 58:29.505
Bitch!

58:50.994 --> 58:53.095
Oh, shit.

58:59.068 --> 59:01.637
Shit.

59:01.639 --> 59:03.705
Wow, you actually
can produce tears.

59:05.074 --> 59:06.241
I owe Marie five bucks.

59:06.243 --> 59:08.210
You little shit!

59:08.212 --> 59:09.711
You didn't even check my pulse?

59:09.713 --> 59:11.847
I thought that you were dead!

59:11.849 --> 59:13.315
I was expecting mouth
to mouth, at least.

59:13.317 --> 59:13.315
Gross.

59:13.317 --> 59:16.552
Faking your death is a
shitty thing to do,

59:16.554 --> 59:17.786
I'll let you know.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.121
Like telling everyone
to let a young girl

59:19.123 --> 59:20.188
die in front of you?

59:21.624 --> 59:22.624
No.

59:23.993 --> 59:25.561
That wasn't right.

59:28.097 --> 59:30.032
I suck.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.266
At least you're honest.

59:36.105 --> 59:38.840
I got back into legro's account.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.909
You hacked into legro's account?

59:40.911 --> 59:42.611
No comment.

59:46.249 --> 59:47.249
Oh my god.

59:48.618 --> 59:50.118
James Ross's medical records.

59:52.655 --> 59:55.591
He had surgery to
get rid of a mole,

59:55.593 --> 59:58.927
then it got infected,
three surgeries.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.096
What is trigeminal neuralgia?

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:04.366
It's an inflamed cranial
nerve in your face.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:07.135
It's so painful they call
it the suicide disease.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.905
No wonder you two hit it off.

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:13.208
That must be why he
wears that mask.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.978
Click there, Katherine Ross.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.112
Must be his mother.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:27.657
Oh my god.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:35.931
Let's just, um,
change it so we can

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.833
watch the security cams
for Everett and Marie.

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.035
Marie?

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.971
Help me, quick.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.272
What the hell happened?

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.808
Pull the needle out.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.844
How'd you get this needle in
your hip in the first place?

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:50.879
Just pull the god
damn needle out!

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.154
Ginny.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:01.723
Got it.

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:32.354
James, I know about your mother.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.822
Katherine Ross.

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.095
No!

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.432
He has to disarm the bomb.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.234
What bomb?

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.707
Disarm the bomb.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:52.709
Disarm the bomb!

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.847
Why are you doing this?

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.883
Is this all because of your mom?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.118
Get us out of here.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.053
He can't.
- What?

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.188
We're locked in by someone else.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.723
Come here, look at this.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.794
- What are you talking about?
- Look at this!

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:14.863
What?

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:23.004
Oh. No, it can't be.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:24.906
Hold on, there's more.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.459
You didn't know, did you?

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.398
Let me see you, James.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400
Sorry.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.270
It's okay.

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.507
It's all right, James.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:00.909
It's all right, it's okay.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.954
It's all right, it's all right.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.058
It's all right.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:21.263
It's all right.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:31.840
Sarah!

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.210
Sarah?

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:40.282
Is that where your
dad is, James?

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.851
Is that where he is?

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:45.320
Doctor crick, doctor
crick, are you up there?

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:53.895
What's he doin' there?

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:55.130
Hmm?

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.531
What's Everett doin' here?

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:56.531
I don't know.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:04:00.101
- We gotta get him outta there, man.
- Whoa.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.403
Come on, we gotta
get finish that.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.904
- Here.
- No, no, no, we can't.

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.306
- Let's go.
- Are you, listen, I'm not gonna...

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.107
No! Listen to me.
I'm not fuckin' around with you.

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:07.342
Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.844
Listen to me, we're
not gonna risk

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.912
- everything to save Everett.
- Look!

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.214
- Alex.
- Look!

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:14.149
- Alex, listen to me.
- What's the matter with you?

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.484
- Nothing's wrong with me. Alex, listen
to me. - I want him outta there.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.286
- Alex.
- I want him outta there now.

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:20.355
- I'm not gonna risk everything
to save Everett. - I'm serious.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.891
Alex, we can't risk everything to save him.
We don't need him.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:26.228
Stop talking about everything, everything.
I want him outta there.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:27.896
- Listen to me.
- Stop it!

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:27.896
We don't need him!

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:31.900
- Would you help me get Everett
out... - no, fuck Everett!

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.270
You listen to me.
You go get him.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.378
Son of a bitch.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380
Look, look.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.117
That's one hell
of a side effect.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:04:59.394
I'm not doin' it.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.528
Do the right thing.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.268
Do it.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.236
Oh, shit.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.339
This has to be done,
but I... god dammit.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.212
Sarah?

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.315
Her pulse is weak, Sarah.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:54.449
Here we go, here we go.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.450
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.452
Sarah, come on.

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.662
Ginny!

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.535
Clear her out of door!

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.407
Oh god, Ginny.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.711
Ginny.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.416
Ginny, come on.

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.391
I'm sorry.

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:38.460
How is she?

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:41.697
We have to go.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.100
We have to go!

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.102
Everett!

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.505
Let's take the stairs.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.611
Let's go.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.416
Come on.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:07.655
Let's go this way.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:12.727
Come on.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.363
Come on, Sarah.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.803
It's blocked here.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:23.104
Step back, step back.

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:28.076
Fuck!

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.448
Okay, watch out for the glass.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.749
Stand back in the corner.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.756
You go first, I'll
go, you come first.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:46.661
Come on.

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:48.196
Come on, Sarah.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.831
Come on. Come on.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:50.833
Keep coming.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.779
Sarah?

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.747
Detective osler, we met
earlier outside the hospital.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.250
I'd like to ask you a couple
more questions if that's okay.

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:46.421
See the thing is, we
did a complete search

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:48.857
of south union cardiac hospital.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.259
We didn't find any
survivors yet.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.895
Did you actually see
Everett barnard

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:56.831
and Marie Blackwell escape?

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:00.768
Hmm.

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.205
What about doctor jenner.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.576
Did you see anything else?

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.514
Nothing I wanna remember.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.483
Mmm.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.386
Okay, thanks.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.191
Feel better.

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.193
I already do.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.595
Whoa.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:30.665
Don't wanna break it,
they only give me one.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:33.835
Wait.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.738
Ginny's cell phone.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:38.872
Yes?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:39.908
Everett has it.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.509
He does?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.609
Do you have that number?

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:44.345
Check the badge, detective.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:51.786
Am I done doin' your work?

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.736
Everett.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:11.906
How's the leg?

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:18.246
That looked pretty bad.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.714
I put about 15
stitches in there.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.384
Stitches, how?

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.920
You remember we talked
about aging being a disease?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.428
This is the cure.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.863
What does it do?

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:39.968
It reverses aging by
extracting enzymes

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.237
from freeze dried stem cells
from living heart tissues.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.239
Freeze dried.

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:46.007
My studies, my work.

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:52.280
Oh yes, I perfected it, but
this is our win, our success.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.581
No.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.852
I, I don't understand.

01:10:57.854 --> 01:11:00.455
Think about it. Never
losing a loved one,

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:01.990
never watching them suffer,

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:05.960
man living to his full
potential, for a price.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.964
A price?

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:11.599
Everything has a price.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.569
What about do no harm, doc?

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:16.704
Is nothing sacred?

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:19.774
Sacrifice is the
production of sacred things.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.811
Nothing is more sacred
than immortality.

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:27.315
No, this, this is not sacred.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.550
This is sacrilege.

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:33.688
Sacrilege is harvesting
embryos from a woman's womb,

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:36.591
and using it in
stem cell research.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.593
That's sacrilege.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.762
How are you different?

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:45.933
People have lived full
lives when I take 'em.

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:48.770
Who gives you permission
to take them?

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:52.073
Who says you get to
play god, crick?

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:55.376
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but god's been a no-show.

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:59.514
And in his absence
somebody's gotta step up.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.463
Well.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.367
Good morning, Marie.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.906
Boris. What are you doing?

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:37.085
It's gonna get a lot worse.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.732
We're almost ready, Alex.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.401
James.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:59.474
He's out of it for a while,
after fresh pain patches.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.850
Everett.

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:11.452
No, not Marie, no.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:13.521
Everett, I want you to join me.

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.392
I don't have a choice.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.726
Well, you have a
choice right now.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.761
Let her go, Boris!

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.797
No.

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:25.900
Her sacrifice will
change the world.

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:29.470
No, there has to be,
what about, um,

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.639
an animal subject, or-or
growing new tissue,

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:32.874
or-or...

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:34.475
What about a new subject?

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.780
Every choice has a price.

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.619
Huh?

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.428
Fine, you're right.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:54.862
What?

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:54.862
Am I?

01:13:54.864 --> 01:14:00.435
This is the greatest medical
discovery of our lifetime.

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:01.536
And it's ours.

01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:02.538
Alex.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:05.540
Think of all the
people we could help.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:07.108
He's stalling!

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.143
And the money, I mean,

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:10.845
this is worth millions.

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.647
Billions, Everett, billions.

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:13.681
That's bullshit!

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.150
Boris!

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.841
Is that better?

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.162
I was sure you'd
appreciate this.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.531
I should've known better.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:06.667
This whole um generation
whining and complaining.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:09.804
"Oh, my med school debt."

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:12.874
"Eighty hour work
weeks, oh my god."

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:15.910
"I don't have enough
friends on Facebook."

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.850
Oh, yeah.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.090
They don't even protest
anymore. They occupy.

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.895
Why should I give
people like that

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:36.030
the secret to eternal life?

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.532
Why?

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:43.538
It didn't have to go this way.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.141
You were like a son to me.

01:15:49.812 --> 01:15:50.912
I guess I'm not comfortable

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:52.880
with your parenting
style, crick.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.015
I don't have a son.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:56.651
He was lost to me.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:15:59.987
Ever since...

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.789
Since you killed his mother.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.727
Katherine Ross.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:08.963
You snuck into her room and
you put heparin into her iv.

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:11.232
Shh, shh, shush.

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:17.004
My wife died of
tragic complications.

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.040
You were the tragic
complication.

01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:23.311
You let your wife
bleed to death,

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:25.680
and you let your son wake up
in a pool of her own blood.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.149
I did what was necessary,

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.251
and I had the will
to see it through.

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:33.354
So do I.

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.161
No.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.797
No.

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:52.239
Not you.

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:30.244
Marie.

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:32.913
Marie.

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.006
Let's go.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.174
Everett.

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:06.981
This was pointless.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:08.349
Excuse me?

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:15.089
I'm gonna continue my
work, and you can't stop me.

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:19.460
No, leave it.

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:24.198
The only reason I
made you a resident...

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:30.204
'Cause you would do
whatever I wanted you to.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.310
It won't end.

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:03.297
See, you just
picked it right up.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:04.331
Oh yeah, just like that.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.469
Hey.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:11.405
Hi. Hi, Sarah.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.442
Hi, doctor barnard.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:16.544
I'm gonna go in back.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.821
Um, sorry I, uh

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:30.157
I would've called, but I
don't have a cell phone.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.593
It's fine, we're
just finishing up.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.595
You look great.

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:36.163
Thanks.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.567
You look, uh, same, great.

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:41.936
Really?

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:45.306
Yeah, the both of you,
it's impressive.

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:46.308
Thanks.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.343
Just started back up again.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.478
Feels good, you know.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.848
Really good.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.015
It shows.

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.219
How was your hearing?

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.256
Other than never being able to

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:04.892
practice medicine again,
it went really well.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:07.628
I'm sorry.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:10.264
I'm not.

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:14.869
And at least I'm a free man.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.641
When are you gonna
go back to work?

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:27.147
I just need time to
process it all, you know?

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:33.621
It's not your fault,
you know that, right?

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:36.390
I was the one who did it.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.059
He deserved it.

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.608
It doesn't matter.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.068
You've got nothing
to worry about now.

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:51.939
Hey.

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:57.912
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:02.116
It was James who saved you.

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:07.221
No, it wasn't.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.597
Uh, can I, can I call you?

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.634
No.

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:22.036
No?

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.605
Why not?

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:30.544
You need a new cell phone first.
