02:50.066 --> 02:52.033
No Carmen
I'm not avoiding you.

02:52.862 --> 02:54.103
Then what's been up?

02:55.036 --> 02:57.867
Nothing, I've
just been, you know,

02:58.005 --> 03:00.421
I've just been a little
busy, that's all.

03:00.559 --> 03:01.595
Where are you now?

03:01.733 --> 03:03.252
I'm at home.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.632
Whose home?

03:06.496 --> 03:07.566
I got to go.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.190
Let's hang out
soon, okay, bye.

03:13.572 --> 03:15.678
You're early.

03:24.169 --> 03:25.446
Surprise.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.448
It's your favorite.

03:27.690 --> 03:28.829
Well almost.

03:28.966 --> 03:30.451
Souffle's got a
little burned.

03:30.589 --> 03:32.073
You made dinner?

03:32.695 --> 03:34.283
Yeah.

03:34.421 --> 03:36.008
I thought we can have date
night early this week.

03:36.146 --> 03:37.872
Something special.

03:46.916 --> 03:49.367
Why is my
mother's silverware out?

04:09.628 --> 04:11.906
I'm being an asshole
again, aren't I?

04:13.874 --> 04:15.116
Come here.

04:17.671 --> 04:20.052
I've just got a lot
going on right now.

04:20.639 --> 04:22.434
I'm a bit overwhelmed.

04:29.096 --> 04:31.236
I just find it
really hard to,

04:33.582 --> 04:34.860
you know?

04:35.308 --> 04:36.379
I understand.

04:37.449 --> 04:39.002
Just talk to me.

04:41.695 --> 05:19.560
[Music]

05:19.698 --> 05:21.528
Don't stop.

05:49.003 --> 05:50.384
I said I'm sorry.

05:57.529 --> 05:58.496
What?

06:03.846 --> 06:10.197
I'm just so disappointed.

06:13.925 --> 06:18.067
Well you're always
so disappointed.

06:48.925 --> 06:50.133
Joy.

07:02.939 --> 07:05.114
Open the fucking door.

07:05.252 --> 07:07.288
Leave me alone.

07:48.433 --> 08:05.519
[Music]

08:30.061 --> 08:31.165
We're not early, right?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.683
Definitely not.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.756
How long has it been?

08:36.895 --> 08:38.966
A fucking decade.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.727
Joy.

08:45.214 --> 08:46.491
She's not
normally like this.

08:46.629 --> 08:48.010
She's...
Fucked up?

08:48.148 --> 08:49.390
Yeah.

08:59.193 --> 09:01.092
Joy what's going on?

09:02.472 --> 09:03.543
Let's go.

09:09.376 --> 09:10.584
Hi.

09:12.137 --> 09:14.139
That's Tara.

09:18.385 --> 09:20.387
Looks like you
didn't sleep again.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.977
You still know the
small tracks, yeah?

09:24.287 --> 09:25.012
Can we just get out of
here before

09:25.150 --> 09:26.669
I change my mind.

09:29.223 --> 09:30.742
Good morning to you, too.

09:34.021 --> 09:40.821
[Music]

09:40.959 --> 09:42.443
Did you like
the flowers I sent you?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.204
You didn't
need to do that.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.033
Yes I did.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.621
Six months free
from that asshole

09:47.759 --> 09:49.381
deserves
a celebration.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.836
How about the vase?

09:56.561 --> 09:57.665
Was it hideous?

09:57.976 --> 09:59.219
Looked like something
my mom would buy?

09:59.357 --> 10:00.323
It is beautiful.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.154
It was heavy.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.052
When's the last time
you left your home?

10:06.744 --> 10:07.986
I don't know.

10:09.436 --> 10:10.989
Okay, you're wearing the
exact same clothes that you

10:11.127 --> 10:12.439
wear when I FaceTimed
you two days ago.

10:12.577 --> 10:13.509
I'm fine.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.441
All right.

10:17.306 --> 10:19.411
Whatever's up you need to
get that shit in check.

10:19.549 --> 10:20.930
I said I'm fine.

10:21.448 --> 10:22.138
20 years into
this friends,

10:22.276 --> 10:23.519
I think I can tell

10:23.657 --> 10:24.865
when my friend is
having a meltdown.

10:25.314 --> 10:27.212
Wherever you are you need
to come out quick

10:27.350 --> 10:28.489
because this weekend is not
gonna be a walk

10:28.628 --> 10:30.008
in the park.

10:30.146 --> 10:31.872
Maybe I don't need
help getting over it.

10:32.010 --> 10:32.977
Maybe it just takes time.

10:33.115 --> 10:34.495
You ever think about that?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.808
Don't let Dr. Dunnley hear that
shit.

10:36.946 --> 10:38.845
You guys talk about her
like you're in a cult.

10:38.983 --> 10:40.329
Everybody needs help.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.468
I'm still trying to get
over that shit

10:41.606 --> 10:42.572
with my jujitsu coach.

10:42.711 --> 10:43.815
I know.

10:43.953 --> 10:45.092
And that is nothing
compared to what Derek

10:45.230 --> 10:46.438
did to you.

10:46.576 --> 10:48.371
I'm trying to stay open.

10:48.509 --> 10:51.547
I just, I think there's
something sick about going

10:51.685 --> 10:53.135
back into your past again
and again

10:53.273 --> 10:55.068
when no one really knows if
that even helps.

10:55.206 --> 10:58.036
What if doing that
is more traumatic?

10:58.174 --> 10:59.141
But if you face it head on

10:59.279 --> 11:00.867
you're less likely to repeat it.

11:01.005 --> 11:02.420
Yeah Freud.

11:02.558 --> 11:06.148
Maybe, but sometimes
it's just enough already.

11:07.321 --> 11:09.151
We're just asking
for one weekend Joy.

11:10.117 --> 11:11.947
I know.
That's why I'm here.

11:12.085 --> 11:16.676
A group is annoying but
Dr. Dunnley is a queen,

11:16.814 --> 11:19.920
a mind queen.

11:22.026 --> 11:22.854
So what do you think?

11:22.992 --> 11:23.406
Are you gonna try or not?

11:23.544 --> 11:24.028
Yes.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.030
Yes.

11:26.168 --> 11:27.721
I will face my
trauma or whatever.

11:28.066 --> 11:28.860
That's the spirit.

11:28.998 --> 11:29.861
Okay now leave me alone.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.552
Let's go.
All right.

11:31.898 --> 12:02.135
[Music]

12:02.376 --> 12:04.309
How long have you been coming on
these retreats?

12:04.447 --> 12:06.795
You're new so
I'll break it down.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.211
All we're gonna do
this weekend is talk,

12:09.349 --> 12:10.799
talk, talk.

12:10.937 --> 12:13.111
So we're not in
group, we got to go do it.

12:13.249 --> 12:14.837
Is it fun?

12:14.975 --> 12:16.287
Yes.

12:16.701 --> 12:19.221
He has this
system, wears a hood.

12:19.359 --> 12:21.982
If the hood is
down, talk to him.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.984
If up, leave him alone.

12:24.122 --> 12:26.090
Where did you hear that?

13:13.344 --> 13:14.517
Drive past the sign

13:14.655 --> 13:16.623
and keep driving for 20 minutes.

13:18.383 --> 13:20.800
This place is more butt
fuck nowhere than usual.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.387
Ackma's have her reasons.

13:22.525 --> 13:23.630
Don't know why this
retreats can't

13:23.768 --> 13:26.046
ever have running water.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.670
Watch out.

13:34.296 --> 13:35.711
Oh my god.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.540
For a second I
thought ghost.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.751
Oh God he's coming over.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.169
Sorry to scare you.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.205
I'm looking for my dog.

13:47.343 --> 13:48.828
Any chance you saw it?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.796
No, sorry.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.211
The camp is just down there

13:53.349 --> 13:55.351
if you happen
to need anything.

13:55.489 --> 13:56.249
That's sweet.

13:56.387 --> 13:57.526
Thank you so much.

14:00.011 --> 14:02.151
Dream the fuck on buddy.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.084
Oh my god.

14:04.222 --> 14:05.465
Oh my god.

14:05.603 --> 14:06.811
Toodle.

14:07.018 --> 14:12.782
[Music]

14:12.921 --> 14:14.405
Oh my god.

14:25.519 --> 14:27.038
Are you okay?

14:51.891 --> 14:52.995
Good.

14:53.754 --> 14:55.066
Very good.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.448
Keep listening
to your body.

14:57.862 --> 14:58.967
Whatever it's saying.

14:59.864 --> 15:04.317
It's saying don't stop.

15:07.561 --> 15:09.460
Not too late to turn back.

15:09.598 --> 15:10.702
Don't be scared.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.808
It's just a
release exercise.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.672
Helps get tension
out of the body.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.923
That's Dr. Dunnley.

15:25.579 --> 15:26.718
A-huh.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.585
No signal.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.311
Welcome to the
Stone Age baby.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.973
You can do this.

15:41.216 --> 15:42.803
He can't hurt
you out here.

15:45.427 --> 15:46.807
I know.

15:48.050 --> 15:48.982
Good.

15:50.121 --> 15:51.640
This is gonna be fun.

15:51.778 --> 15:53.331
Hmm.

15:53.469 --> 15:55.644
Unless you have a problem
with shitting in the woods

15:55.782 --> 15:59.199
in which case it's
gonna be pretty horrible.

16:00.028 --> 16:01.684
Okay.

16:01.822 --> 16:03.583
Let's let the
healing begin.

16:04.722 --> 16:05.930
That's right.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.042
He's not here.

16:20.255 --> 16:20.980
You've arrived.

16:21.118 --> 16:22.257
You must be Joy.

16:22.395 --> 16:23.879
Hi.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.708
I'm sorry you couldn't
make it to orientation

16:25.846 --> 16:28.021
but I appreciated your letter.

16:28.159 --> 16:29.471
Dr. Carol Dunnley.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.920
It's nice to
finally meet you Carol.

16:31.059 --> 16:33.785
Dr. Carol or Dr.
Dunnley if you don't mind.

16:33.923 --> 16:35.511
Nice to meet you, too.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.237
Welcome to our group.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.273
Thanks.

16:38.411 --> 16:39.860
I just hope I can keep up.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.863
It's not easy to leave the
comfort of your lives behind.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.935
But risk equals growth.

16:46.246 --> 16:47.523
Keep that in mind.

16:48.835 --> 16:50.699
We're really
glad you're here.

16:51.493 --> 16:52.701
Me, too.

16:57.706 --> 16:59.190
That's where we're going?

17:00.640 --> 17:01.951
That's where we're going.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.550
That's pretty steep.

17:16.207 --> 17:18.243
By the end of the
trip you'll see,

17:18.382 --> 17:20.521
you're far more capable
than you ever imagined.

17:20.660 --> 17:22.179
That's what I
always tell her.

17:23.387 --> 17:24.767
I want to believe you.

17:24.905 --> 17:26.597
So what's stopping you?

17:28.425 --> 17:30.049
Go.

17:59.457 --> 18:02.564
There's someone
[Indiscernible].

18:02.702 --> 18:03.806
Just one.

18:05.429 --> 18:08.397
You're out of
[Indiscernible].

18:08.811 --> 18:11.090
I don't want to
leave anybody out.

18:17.061 --> 18:22.791
Alcoholic, sex
addict, drugs,

18:22.929 --> 18:25.621
coke, no coke.

18:25.759 --> 18:29.280
Okay, something easier.

18:34.251 --> 18:35.562
I'm a psychopath.

18:35.873 --> 18:37.150
What's your deal?

18:37.288 --> 18:38.634
Oh you don't get to hear
about my shit

18:38.772 --> 18:40.257
until you share about yours.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.294
Okay Shaina, she's new.

18:43.432 --> 18:44.640
It's all good.

18:44.778 --> 18:46.021
Okay, fine.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.610
I guess I'll go first.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.647
I used to be in the
army,

18:51.785 --> 18:55.410
three tours, Afghanistan.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.068
I've been with Dr. Carol
the longest

18:59.207 --> 19:01.209
and I'm the only one with a map.

19:04.453 --> 19:11.495
I'm bitter, full of
rage and self-aware.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.084
Your turn.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.465
Oh Jesus.

19:20.745 --> 19:22.437
My ex was a dick.

19:24.335 --> 19:25.509
And?

19:27.649 --> 19:28.857
He attacked me.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.173
And?

19:34.828 --> 19:36.899
What is this, the
trauma Olympics?

19:38.729 --> 19:41.525
Oh, you wouldn't
make it past regionals.

19:48.187 --> 19:59.957
[Music]

20:00.095 --> 20:01.407
What is that?

20:01.545 --> 20:04.272
Maybe they were
attacked by a bear.

20:04.513 --> 20:05.411
Right.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.930
That reminds me, heads up.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.176
Bear spray?

20:12.935 --> 20:15.214
Worst case scenario
that's our best defense.

20:18.389 --> 20:19.666
Did you put that here?

20:19.804 --> 20:21.081
What do you mean?

20:21.220 --> 20:24.188
I mean, is that part
of the treatment?

20:25.879 --> 20:27.191
Does it scare you?

20:28.192 --> 20:29.055
Yes.

20:30.505 --> 20:31.885
Then it's part
of the treatment.

20:39.617 --> 20:40.515
Let's keep it moving.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.866
Being in nature, I felt
that it would have just

20:47.004 --> 20:48.626
fixed the situation
right away, right?

20:48.764 --> 20:50.973
But that's,
like you said,

20:51.111 --> 20:52.492
it's all a process.

20:53.148 --> 20:54.253
I've done all
the exercises.

20:54.391 --> 20:55.771
I've taken everything.

20:55.909 --> 20:58.257
I'm doing the work.

21:01.881 --> 21:03.089
I don't know what
you want me to say.

21:06.023 --> 21:11.891
It's getting really hard
to be there for her.

21:14.273 --> 21:19.830
But she was there for me
and I don't know,

21:19.968 --> 21:21.280
I'm really angry about him.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.180
And I don't know
what's best.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.077
I don't know.

[Music]

23:02.242 --> 23:02.898
Hi Joy.

23:03.865 --> 23:04.383
Come on.

23:05.073 --> 23:05.867
Get moving.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.077
It's a big day.

23:09.215 --> 23:11.700
Let's show the past
who's in charge.

23:11.838 --> 23:12.425
Come on.

23:16.843 --> 23:17.568
We're going that way?

23:17.706 --> 23:18.189
Yup.

23:19.777 --> 23:20.709
Is it gonna stay quiet?

23:20.847 --> 23:21.538
Nope.

23:30.788 --> 23:31.582
Hurry up.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.273
Let's move out.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.551
I'm coming.

23:36.622 --> 23:37.416
Move.

23:49.704 --> 23:50.636
Hey guys stop.

23:55.503 --> 23:56.124
Listen.

23:58.057 --> 23:59.023
Do you hear that?

24:03.303 --> 24:05.098
Why in the hell?

24:05.236 --> 24:07.273
Smells like hell.

24:07.411 --> 24:08.757
What's wrong with it?

24:08.895 --> 24:10.725
It's just natural gases.

24:10.863 --> 24:12.485
Is all the
water like that?

24:12.623 --> 24:14.625
We only brought a few
bottles and one filter.

24:14.763 --> 24:16.455
Oh my god, it's fine.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.353
Let's just keep going.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.355
This place is
full of water.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.943
What if it's gone.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.292
There's gonna be
another creek up ahead.

25:17.239 --> 25:17.757

It's a trust exercise.

25:21.209 --> 25:22.521
You got to trust me.

25:22.659 --> 25:23.867
Up.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.317
Put it up you fucker.

25:42.264 --> 25:44.543
Shaina, what
are you doing?

25:44.681 --> 25:46.717
It really concerns me
that you don't

25:46.855 --> 25:47.925
know that sound.

25:48.063 --> 25:51.446
I want some quiet, shh.

26:08.705 --> 26:09.947
Thanks.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.811
What do you do if
you hear that noise

26:11.949 --> 26:13.468
in the forest?

26:13.606 --> 26:15.988
You do nothing,
abso-fucking-lutely

26:16.126 --> 26:16.816
nothing.

26:16.954 --> 26:17.748
You know why?

26:17.886 --> 26:19.267
Because it's cougar.

26:24.237 --> 26:25.584
I really fucked that up.

26:26.446 --> 26:27.551
Careful a foot.

27:03.104 --> 27:03.691
Joy.

27:03.829 --> 27:05.037
Derek?

27:07.487 --> 27:10.629
Joy, hey.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.665
Are you okay?

27:13.770 --> 27:15.185
You didn't hear that?

27:15.323 --> 27:16.531
What?

27:18.775 --> 27:19.983
Joy.

27:23.952 --> 27:25.126
What happened?

27:25.264 --> 27:26.955
This whole
thing is fucked.

27:28.992 --> 27:30.510
I can see you're angry.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.029
Do you even know
where we are?

27:32.167 --> 27:33.548
Have you even
been here before?

27:34.307 --> 27:37.414
Not to this exact spot,
but I know these parts

27:37.552 --> 27:39.796
really well.

27:39.934 --> 27:42.143
I think it's important
for us to experience

27:42.281 --> 27:44.007
something new together.

27:44.973 --> 27:46.388
This is not what
I signed up for.

27:46.526 --> 27:51.014
Joy, there's no coming
to consciousness without

27:51.152 --> 27:52.740
pain and discomfort.

27:54.224 --> 27:56.467
People will do
anything to avoid it.

28:01.610 --> 28:02.922
What was that?

28:03.060 --> 28:03.716
Are you always
comfortable not knowing

28:03.854 --> 28:04.752
where we are?

28:04.890 --> 28:06.132
Okay.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.582
If you want to go
back we can go back.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.928
But if this is about
something else?

28:11.897 --> 28:13.864
Why did you yell
out Derek's name?

28:16.418 --> 28:18.075
If this is about him
it's not gonna get

28:18.213 --> 28:19.594
better back in the city.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.837
That is why we are here.

28:21.941 --> 28:28.465
Listen, I think he
might be following us.

28:28.603 --> 28:32.124
In the forest back
there I heard him.

28:32.262 --> 28:34.574
Like he was right there.

28:35.541 --> 28:36.542
Joy I was right
beside you.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.578
I didn't hear anything.

28:39.925 --> 28:42.203
We both know that you've
been having flashbacks.

28:42.341 --> 28:43.687
So what?

28:44.446 --> 28:46.276
So is this
any different?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.453
Glad I joined this
support group.

28:51.591 --> 28:52.731
Joy.

28:52.869 --> 28:53.490
Joy that's not
what I meant.

28:53.628 --> 28:54.905
Joy come back.

28:59.703 --> 29:01.256
Where's Tara?

29:48.994 --> 29:50.478
Tara, are you okay?

29:50.616 --> 29:51.686
Are you okay?

29:51.824 --> 29:52.307
There's someone
behind me.

29:52.445 --> 29:53.136
What?

29:53.274 --> 29:54.689
He was there.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.035
Who did you see?

29:56.173 --> 29:57.519
No one.
Tara who did you see?

29:57.657 --> 29:59.798
Well just a shadow
Joy, it's fine.

30:04.078 --> 30:04.975
Are you sure?

30:05.113 --> 30:06.494
Yes.

30:08.116 --> 30:09.635
All right.

30:09.773 --> 30:10.981
I used to see things.

30:11.119 --> 30:14.329
I used to see
him all the time.

30:14.467 --> 30:15.986
It's probably just an
animal or something,

30:16.124 --> 30:17.263
I don't know.

30:18.471 --> 30:20.577
I heard something.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.682
Earlier I heard
something.

30:24.236 --> 30:27.101
It feels like
something or someone

30:27.239 --> 30:28.585
is watching us.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.831
Carmen was right.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.143
You're a good friend.

30:38.491 --> 30:39.768
See you at camp.

30:51.677 --> 30:53.403
Oh my god.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.648
What happened to it?

30:57.786 --> 31:00.686
It might have been dead
before whatever got it

31:00.824 --> 31:01.445
got it.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.172
We shouldn't be here.

31:05.415 --> 31:06.623
It's nature.

31:06.761 --> 31:08.452
We're not here to
interfere with it.

31:08.590 --> 31:10.144
We just stick to
our protocols.

31:11.179 --> 31:11.973
Right.

31:12.111 --> 31:14.044
No food in the tents.

31:14.182 --> 31:15.563
We all stick together.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.472
The thing is I would
prefer to die.

32:02.610 --> 32:03.507
I would.

32:03.645 --> 32:05.233
I wouldn't do anything.

32:17.004 --> 32:17.797
Joy.

32:36.437 --> 32:37.403
What happened to her?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.581
It's not really my
business to tell you.

32:43.685 --> 32:44.963
It's really fucked up.

32:45.101 --> 32:47.379
Carmen, what's
taking so long?

32:47.517 --> 32:48.311
No, I'm not telling you.

32:48.449 --> 32:49.036
I'm not telling you.

32:49.174 --> 32:49.691
I'm not.

I don't think I
want to do this.

the point Joy.

something on your mind.

35:09.210 --> 35:10.832

35:12.282 --> 35:12.938
She needs it.

Okay.

35:14.664 --> 35:15.320
Are you ready?

35:16.804 --> 35:18.185
Can I ask you something?

35:18.323 --> 35:19.393
Of course.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.051
Is this whole trip an
elaborate way for you to

35:23.190 --> 35:24.501
scare the shit
out of us?

35:26.952 --> 35:29.023
Do you know what
my biggest fear is?

35:29.161 --> 35:30.128
What?

35:31.301 --> 35:33.407
Doing harm to
my patients.

35:33.545 --> 35:35.063
I would never do that.

35:36.893 --> 35:38.308
All right.

35:38.446 --> 35:41.725
And also I can assure
you that this place

35:41.863 --> 35:44.659
is safe, sacred even.

35:45.453 --> 35:46.765
People have been coming
here for thousands

35:46.903 --> 35:47.697
of years.

35:47.835 --> 35:49.664
It's very special.

35:49.802 --> 35:50.907
What do you mean?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.773
Well it's my
understanding the people

35:54.911 --> 35:57.879
always came here to
do healing ceremonies.

35:58.017 --> 36:00.606
They believe there was
a powerful spirit here.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.574
And to keep in good
relation with it

36:02.712 --> 36:04.852
they made offerings.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.682
More generations than
we can even imagine.

36:07.820 --> 36:09.650
Why did they stop?

36:10.478 --> 36:12.963
The only reasons I
suppose, name any part

36:13.101 --> 36:15.380
of the colonial
shit show.

36:15.518 --> 36:17.416
What happened
to it then?

36:17.554 --> 36:18.866
To what?

36:19.004 --> 36:22.249
The spirit without
the offerings?

36:23.215 --> 36:25.113
Good question.

36:25.252 --> 36:27.771
Attention everyone.

36:29.256 --> 36:32.604
We're gonna head
up this mountain.

36:32.742 --> 36:35.193
There's a river
on the other side.

36:35.331 --> 36:36.642
We leave in 10.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.093
We could find some flat
surface to set up

36:39.231 --> 36:42.545
a camp on before dark.

36:42.683 --> 36:45.755
So get your water
bottles get some water

36:45.893 --> 36:47.515
and let's get going.

36:48.585 --> 36:53.107
Hey, oh never mind.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.867
I'm sorry doctor.

37:07.777 --> 37:08.536
Hey.

37:09.813 --> 37:10.435
Hey.

37:12.575 --> 37:14.715
Will you come with me
and hold the bear spray.

37:14.853 --> 37:16.406
I have to pee.

37:18.374 --> 37:19.685
I would be honored.

37:20.790 --> 37:23.413
Look, I found your
giant ass cap.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.141
Okay, just hold it there,

37:27.279 --> 37:28.591
make sure it's connected.

37:28.729 --> 37:30.282
Yeah.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.389
And then you maintain a
stance of superiority.

37:35.632 --> 37:36.288
Turn around.

37:36.426 --> 37:37.082
Are you sure?

37:37.220 --> 37:37.945
Turn around,

37:38.083 --> 37:39.187
I'm good.
Yes.

37:39.326 --> 37:40.430
Okay fine, I'll
turn around.

37:45.297 --> 37:46.988
Stop.

37:47.126 --> 37:47.782
Stop.

37:47.920 --> 37:48.576
Okay fine.

37:48.714 --> 37:50.164
Okay, here I go.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.379
Stop.
Oh my god.

37:58.517 --> 37:59.035
Get out.

37:59.173 --> 37:59.829
Get lost.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.002
Go.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.521
Okay fine.

38:02.659 --> 38:03.764
Good luck.

38:03.902 --> 38:04.972
Thanks.

38:11.150 --> 38:14.533
So I just had
a weird thing.

38:14.671 --> 38:17.778
Like I saw, you know,
stuff from before.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.781
Yeah, okay.

38:20.919 --> 38:22.783
Can you tell me more?

38:22.921 --> 38:25.544
It won't make
sense if I explain.

38:25.682 --> 38:29.548
Just, I don't want the
feeling back there.

38:29.686 --> 38:31.136
And you're always saying
that we should listen to

38:31.274 --> 38:32.240
how we feel.

38:32.862 --> 38:33.863
Yeah.

38:34.001 --> 38:35.727
Yeah, that's my bad.

38:35.865 --> 38:37.418
I freaked her out
talking about

38:37.556 --> 38:39.558
cougars earlier.

38:39.696 --> 38:40.835
You did not.

38:40.973 --> 38:42.630
Are you afraid
of the climb?

38:42.768 --> 38:44.149
What?

38:44.287 --> 38:46.116
I would be too if I
had those shoes on.

38:46.254 --> 38:47.325
Shaina.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.225
Yes.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.502
Thank you.

38:54.815 --> 38:58.853
So how are you
feeling now here?

39:07.172 --> 39:08.276
I like it here.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.832

than back there.

41:17.647 --> 41:18.890
Tara can you
get a blanket?

41:19.028 --> 41:19.822
Yup, got it.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.652
Okay, okay, okay.

41:22.790 --> 41:24.136
Breathe, breathe.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.034
Okay.

41:25.172 --> 41:25.966
We'll get you warm.

41:26.104 --> 41:27.001
It's okay sweetie.

41:27.139 --> 41:28.382
There you go.

41:29.659 --> 41:30.557
Take a breath.

41:30.695 --> 41:32.041
It's okay.

41:32.179 --> 41:34.215
It's like it
was in my head.

41:34.353 --> 41:35.838
Was it a bear?

41:35.976 --> 41:38.841
It's completely natural
to back slide after

41:38.979 --> 41:40.049
you've made
some progress.

41:40.187 --> 41:41.464
You don't understand.

41:41.602 --> 41:42.603
This has never
happened to me before.

41:42.741 --> 41:44.432
There's something
out there.

41:44.571 --> 41:46.193
Something caused this.

41:46.331 --> 41:48.506
The same thing happened
to Tara, I saw it.

41:48.644 --> 41:49.886
Is that true?

41:50.024 --> 41:51.163
What?

41:51.301 --> 41:53.476
It wasn't like a
normal flashback.

41:53.614 --> 41:55.513
It felt like something
was being

41:55.651 --> 41:56.755
pulled out of me.

41:56.893 --> 41:57.963
What was pulled
out of you?

41:59.378 --> 42:01.277
Joy, listen.

42:01.415 --> 42:03.072
I know it doesn't feel
like it but you can

42:03.210 --> 42:04.487
overcome this.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.019
If it has a scent it
goes in the bag

42:19.157 --> 42:20.365
even toothpaste.

42:20.503 --> 42:22.332
Toothpaste, seriously?

42:22.470 --> 42:23.541
Yeah.

42:24.472 --> 42:25.853
Bears can smell it.

42:27.924 --> 42:31.928
And we didn't do this
last night because?

42:32.066 --> 42:33.516
We should have.

42:43.284 --> 43:07.446
[Music]

43:07.585 --> 43:09.138
Joy where are
you right now?

43:16.766 --> 43:20.598
I thought things
could get better

43:20.736 --> 43:22.910
if I tried harder.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.779
How many second chances
did you give him?

43:29.917 --> 43:32.955
You don't know
what I did to him.

43:33.093 --> 43:35.751
I deserve to
feel like shit.

43:35.889 --> 43:38.788
Joy you've made major
strides here

43:38.926 --> 43:40.134
this weekend.

43:42.930 --> 43:44.552
Nostalgia is
the devil man.

43:48.142 --> 43:49.281
You left him.

43:50.489 --> 43:51.525
I'm proud of you.

43:51.663 --> 44:35.155
[Music]

44:35.293 --> 44:36.052
Joy.

45:03.666 --> 45:04.598
Carmen.

45:48.124 --> 45:49.160
Joy.

45:49.298 --> 45:51.093
We were calling you.

45:57.513 --> 45:59.826
You know my dad
gave me this knife.

45:59.964 --> 46:02.552
I used to go camping all
the time with my parents

46:02.690 --> 46:03.761
when I was a kid.

46:03.899 --> 46:05.521
My mom hated it.

46:05.659 --> 46:07.523
Me and my dad
loved going.

46:07.661 --> 46:11.423
So she'd just tag along
until they got really

46:11.561 --> 46:15.186
mad one day and
said that I hated

46:15.324 --> 46:16.566
family trips.

46:16.704 --> 46:18.776
And then we never
went camping again.

46:22.020 --> 46:23.677
What are you guys
doing out here?

46:23.815 --> 46:25.610
We couldn't sleep.

46:25.748 --> 46:27.474
Nightmares.

46:29.096 --> 46:30.166
Me, too.

46:32.237 --> 46:34.481
I had this dream.

46:34.619 --> 46:38.036
There was a man but he
wasn't really a man.

46:38.174 --> 46:41.799
It was, it was
this thing.

46:41.937 --> 46:43.870
All I could make out
were like a bunch of...

46:44.008 --> 46:45.078
Shadows.

46:47.149 --> 46:49.047
Rotting wounds.

46:49.185 --> 46:51.394
I had the exact
same dream.

46:53.155 --> 46:55.157
The thing I
encountered today,

46:56.883 --> 46:58.954
I think it's causing this.

47:01.163 --> 47:02.820
Okay, we've all been
talking about a lot of

47:02.958 --> 47:04.304
scary shit.

47:04.442 --> 47:05.443
Maybe you guys are
just processing it.

47:05.581 --> 47:06.444
No.

47:07.686 --> 47:09.171
It's like just
being here does

47:09.309 --> 47:10.137
something to us.

47:10.275 --> 47:11.518
Not me.

47:11.656 --> 47:13.451
You're not as
fucked up as we are.

47:15.660 --> 47:18.490
So, what do we do?

47:23.910 --> 47:25.118
Okay, let's talk to
Dunnley and Shaina

47:25.256 --> 47:26.326
first thing in the morning.

47:28.984 --> 47:31.020
Can I sleep with
you guys tonight?

47:31.158 --> 47:33.712
Yeah, of course.

47:38.614 --> 47:40.892
One scout.

47:41.030 --> 47:42.066
Fuck you.

47:45.345 --> 47:46.553
Shaina.

47:52.007 --> 47:53.560
Hey, did you
see Tara get up?

47:54.906 --> 47:56.218
Did you see Tara get up?

47:59.186 --> 48:00.360
Okay, thanks for
your help.

48:10.853 --> 48:13.028
Wake up you vermins.

48:14.063 --> 48:15.375
We can hear you.

48:28.767 --> 48:30.148
Good morning.

48:30.286 --> 48:31.046
Good morning.

48:37.673 --> 48:38.605
Tara.

48:42.091 --> 48:43.679
Have you seen Tara?

48:43.817 --> 48:45.232
She's usually
the first one up.

48:45.370 --> 48:46.716
Fuck.

48:46.854 --> 48:48.477
That fucking mall rat.

48:48.615 --> 48:49.823
There goes all our food.

48:49.961 --> 48:51.480
But there's no
way Tara did this.

48:51.618 --> 48:52.826
You don't even know her.

48:52.964 --> 48:54.310
I'm sure there's
another explanation.

48:54.448 --> 48:55.691
Face it.

48:55.829 --> 48:57.520
Tara's back to her
old pranks again.

48:59.626 --> 49:02.215
I thought she was
past all these games.

49:02.353 --> 49:03.457
Something must
have triggered her.

49:03.595 --> 49:05.632
No, something
is going on.

49:05.770 --> 49:08.152
We were up late last
night, Carmen too.

49:09.256 --> 49:10.948
We all had the
same nightmare.

49:11.086 --> 49:12.673
She was so scared she
slept in our tent.

49:12.811 --> 49:13.743
So you're
gassing her up.

49:13.881 --> 49:15.021
Excuse me.

49:15.159 --> 49:15.987
None of that
matters right now.

49:16.125 --> 49:17.264
We have to find Tara.

49:17.402 --> 49:18.472
Well she can't
have gone far.

49:18.610 --> 49:20.095
I'll go find her
and we'll get

49:20.233 --> 49:21.717
to the bottom of this.

49:21.855 --> 49:23.615
Wake up people.

49:23.753 --> 49:25.376
The food is gone.

49:25.514 --> 49:26.584
The trip is over.

49:26.722 --> 49:27.895
We need to get
out of here.

49:28.034 --> 49:29.173
That we agree on.

49:29.311 --> 49:30.484
I think I know
where she is.

49:30.622 --> 49:31.313
I'll come with you.

49:31.451 --> 49:32.831
No, no.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.350
It's not gonna help
if we bombard her.

49:34.488 --> 49:36.525
I need to speak to her
for a few minutes alone.

49:36.663 --> 49:37.767
I don't think it's safe.

49:37.905 --> 49:39.114
I'll make a
lot of noise.

49:39.252 --> 49:40.184
I've got my bear spray.

49:40.322 --> 49:41.185
I'll be okay.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.296
This isn't fucking good.

49:53.852 --> 49:55.061
Tara.

50:13.976 --> 50:14.839
Tara.

50:46.629 --> 50:48.528
Dr. Dunnley.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.426
Shaina, Shaina wait.

50:50.564 --> 50:51.531
We need to
stick together.

50:51.669 --> 50:52.566
Slow down.

50:52.704 --> 50:53.533
Come on.

50:53.671 --> 50:54.775
Slow down.

50:54.913 --> 50:55.742
We have to
stick together.

50:55.880 --> 50:56.570
Hurry up.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.300
What the hell
happened here?

51:02.438 --> 51:04.751
We need to slow down
and make a plan.

51:08.686 --> 51:09.652
Fuck.

51:14.657 --> 51:16.073
Dr. Dunnley.

51:25.806 --> 51:26.738
Over there.

51:26.876 --> 51:27.808
Look.

51:27.946 --> 51:28.809
Oh my god.

51:28.947 --> 51:30.017
We have to go.

51:30.156 --> 51:31.088
We have to go back.

51:31.226 --> 51:32.158
We have to get help.

51:32.296 --> 51:32.951
We have no time.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.194
It's not safe.

51:34.332 --> 51:35.437
She could be up
there somewhere.

51:35.575 --> 51:36.541
Shaina, look,
there's blood on

51:36.679 --> 51:37.508
the fucking rock.

51:37.646 --> 51:38.854
We can't go up there.

51:38.992 --> 51:39.958
How would you feel
if it was you

51:40.097 --> 51:41.443
and that was your blood?

51:41.581 --> 51:42.892
We have to go back
Shaina, we have to.

51:43.030 --> 51:43.479
Shaina.

51:43.617 --> 51:44.066
Wait.

51:44.377 --> 51:44.963
Wait.

51:45.102 --> 51:45.516
Shaina wait.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.725
Shaina come back.

51:49.554 --> 51:50.383
Shaina.

51:53.869 --> 51:54.801
Shaina.

51:59.081 --> 52:30.354
[Music]

52:58.589 --> 53:00.211
No.

53:09.047 --> 53:10.601
Let him go.

53:16.227 --> 53:17.849
Oh my god, Shaina.

53:23.234 --> 53:24.235
Where the fuck is she?

53:30.034 --> 53:31.035
Where is she?

53:31.794 --> 53:33.210
Carmen I don't see her.

53:33.348 --> 53:34.556
I saw her fall.

53:35.108 --> 53:36.282
I don't understand.

53:50.088 --> 53:51.020
Oh God.

53:51.711 --> 53:52.436
Shaina.

53:54.990 --> 53:56.336
Shaina.

54:08.693 --> 54:09.487
Joy.

54:19.773 --> 54:20.809
Oh my god.

54:23.743 --> 54:24.640
Oh my god.

54:29.093 --> 54:30.059
Oh my god.

54:31.613 --> 54:32.476
Oh Joy.

54:38.792 --> 54:39.828
Shaina.

54:56.810 --> 54:57.673
What is that?

55:52.832 --> 55:53.867
Do you smell that?

55:55.144 --> 55:56.491
Yeah.

55:56.629 --> 55:57.250
If there is something
in there we can

55:57.388 --> 55:58.044
hear it right?

55:58.838 --> 56:00.149
Not if it's hiding.

57:15.086 --> 57:15.846
It's Tara.

57:15.984 --> 57:17.088
Tara's here.

57:27.927 --> 57:30.930
Hey Tara, where
are the others?

57:31.068 --> 57:32.103
He's here.

57:33.415 --> 57:34.071
I'm gonna go.

57:34.209 --> 57:34.899
I'm gonna go.

57:35.037 --> 57:36.314
Take her now.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.177
Wait.

57:37.315 --> 57:37.902
Joy just take her.

57:38.040 --> 57:38.489
It's fine.

57:38.627 --> 57:39.076
Go.

58:03.618 --> 58:04.791
I'm down here.

58:10.866 --> 58:11.867
Help.

58:21.843 --> 58:23.741
Hey, hey.

58:24.846 --> 58:26.433
Dunnley, can
you reach me?

58:30.023 --> 58:31.300
Oh my God.

58:31.438 --> 58:33.026
Hey, I'm gonna
come down.

58:57.188 --> 58:58.017

Go.

59:17.381 --> 59:18.071
Run.

59:40.335 --> 59:40.956
Don't.

59:41.094 --> 59:41.854
Let me see.

01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:08.181
Joy.

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:10.218
Joy, he's behind you.

01:01:10.356 --> 01:01:11.702
Joy.

01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:16.811
Go, go.

01:01:19.814 --> 01:01:21.229
Get in the water.

01:01:21.367 --> 01:01:23.024
Get in the water.

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:30.894
Go.

01:01:36.278 --> 01:01:37.314
Go.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.614
Maybe it's giving up.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:03.133
No.

01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:05.238
It's bleeding us out.

01:02:13.246 --> 01:02:14.075
Oh God.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.026
I'll die here Carmen.

01:02:34.164 --> 01:02:34.612
No.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.441
No.

01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:50.421
It will wait
until we come out.

01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.462
Until [Indiscernible].

01:02:58.257 --> 01:02:59.948
Get the
hell out of here.

01:03:00.086 --> 01:03:01.363
You're not gonna die.

01:03:03.262 --> 01:03:04.781
You won't die in a cage.

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:06.334
No way.

01:03:06.472 --> 01:03:07.335
Anything but that.

01:03:07.473 --> 01:03:08.474
You're not gonna die.

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:16.171
Give me some space.

01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:17.621
I'm warm.

01:03:18.553 --> 01:03:19.657
Just...

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.483
Come on you fucker.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.496
Go, go, we have to go.

01:04:38.426 --> 01:04:40.152
Joy I don't think
I can go much

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.222
further like this.

01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:44.225
Oh god.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:13.910
Ready?

01:05:14.048 --> 01:05:14.911
Okay.

01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:23.298
In case we'll get out of
here, there's something

01:05:23.436 --> 01:05:24.506
I want you to know.

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:28.062
Joy this isn't
what I want.

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.961
Oh god.

01:05:36.449 --> 01:05:39.004
It hasn't been six months
since I saw Derek.

01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:42.455
He was on my place
the morning we went.

01:05:44.388 --> 01:05:45.079
What?

01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:03.338
Six months of freedom,
so proud of you.

01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:05.202
XO, Carmen.

01:06:12.382 --> 01:06:13.728
I have to go soon.

01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:16.800
Where are you going?

01:06:18.284 --> 01:06:18.975
Camping.

01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:34.611
I just think that
maybe we shouldn't

01:06:34.749 --> 01:06:36.716
keep working things
out, you know.

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:38.649
I don't think so.

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:42.860
Last night shouldn't
have happened.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.552
Well you seemed happy.

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:50.868
You invite me in.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.801
No, I didn't
invite you in.

01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:57.668
You showed up at my door
crying and I thought you

01:06:57.806 --> 01:06:58.566
just wanted to talk.

01:06:58.704 --> 01:06:59.877
And then, and...

01:08:03.631 --> 01:08:04.252
Joy.

01:08:05.702 --> 01:08:06.496
Joy.

01:08:07.945 --> 01:08:09.292
How long have you been
fucking lying to me

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:10.120
about seeing him?

01:08:10.258 --> 01:08:11.397
I haven't lied.

01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:13.675
I wasn't.

01:08:15.263 --> 01:08:16.851
It wasn't like I
was seeing him.

01:08:16.988 --> 01:08:19.612
It was just, he kept
calling, and calling,

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.027
calling.

01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:21.787
I saw you block his
fucking call Joy.

01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:23.408
I did.

01:08:23.547 --> 01:08:26.136
He kept showing up and
begging to talk to me.

01:08:26.273 --> 01:08:29.760
He feels so bad,
it's killing him.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:31.555
And he just wanted
me to hug him.

01:08:31.693 --> 01:08:33.246
I don't know.

01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:34.627
I don't know.

01:08:34.764 --> 01:08:36.974
I still love him.

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:39.287
He killed your dog Joy.

01:08:43.809 --> 01:08:45.121
Okay, you know what
I have a confession

01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:46.432
of my own.

01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:49.469
This was your
last change Joy.

01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:53.646
I told myself I would
not stay in a friendship

01:08:53.783 --> 01:08:54.853
where I care about
your wellbeing

01:08:54.992 --> 01:08:56.270
more than you do.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.720
It's too
fucking painful.

01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:04.139
How can you say that?

01:09:06.969 --> 01:09:10.767
I just, I just really
want to go home.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.736

I'm okay.

to my place.

the hospital.
