her marriage to this man.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.553
Please. Don't.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.308
Don't do this.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.686
I held her in my arms...

39:19.274 --> 39:23.233
...and watched the life
disappear from her eyes.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.355
You destroyed a creature...

39:28.992 --> 39:31.449
...more beautiful than...

39:31.661 --> 39:34.243

-There's been a bump.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.644
They're rejecting my baby?

40:08.823 --> 40:11.940
NO, not exactly.
They still want the baby.

Oh, I see.

I'm sorry, Liz.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.677
But they'll only take the baby
if it's a closed adoption.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.056
Meaning I would never know my child?

40:37.268 --> 40:40.135
My baby would never know who I am?
I can't do that.

40:40.313 --> 40:44.147

how difficult this was gonna be.

40:44.317 --> 40:47.150
