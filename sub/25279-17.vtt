00:09.968 --> 00:10.844
Hi.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.262
Hey.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.764
Ready to get started?

00:14.848 --> 00:18.226
Well, I was kinda hoping
you'd cook me breakfast first.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.187
Got a hankering for like a frittata
and maybe some...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.273
turkey sausage.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.401
I'm just kidding, Beau.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.236
Uncle Beau?

00:28.945 --> 00:29.863
Mr. Beau?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.241
You really don't joke around, do you?

00:33.324 --> 00:34.868
I joke all the time.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.286
Knock knock.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.704
Who's there?

00:37.787 --> 00:39.080
Shut the fuck up.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.879
Hey, Colt. You got a second to talk?

00:45.962 --> 00:49.382
Save it.
You're only here 'cause he wants you here.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.385
You stay away from my wife and my kid.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.642
Sorry about that.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.352
He'll come around.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.189
No, I get it. He's just being protective.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.858
I'd do the same thing if I had a wife...

01:07.692 --> 01:08.693
or a kid...

01:09.319 --> 01:11.404
or even like a, y'know, loyal dog.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.910
I dunno why we're talking about this.
I feel like I'm on <i>Oprah. </i>Anyways...

01:19.537 --> 01:21.915
If it's making him upset,
me being here, I can leave.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.500
Just give him time.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.919
Colt's emotional.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.838
When he found out they'd took rose hips
or some other shit

01:28.922 --> 01:32.217
out of his body wash
he broke his toe kicking a shopping cart.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.012
What the fuck is a rose hips?

01:38.139 --> 01:39.099
Know what?

01:39.849 --> 01:41.101
Call me Uncle Beau.

Hey, babe.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.180
Hey.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.222
How's it going?

03:02.223 --> 03:05.476
Well, I'm gonna talk in my happy voice
so we don't upset our baby,

03:05.560 --> 03:08.938
but my boobs feel like
they've been through a cheese grater.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.692
[laughing] Yeah, I get it.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.819
In high school I dated a girl
who had braces.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.198
That was me.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.699
Yes, it was.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.203
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.955
She keeps gnawing on me.
She doesn't even have any teeth.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.041
She's like an old woman
trying to eat an apple.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.756
Why would you hurt a thing
that nourishes you?

03:34.923 --> 03:35.757
[Abby chuckles]

03:40.303 --> 03:42.931
If there was a boob
that had beer that came out of it

03:43.014 --> 03:44.891
I'd turn that thing into a religion.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.353
Taken the medicines I gave you?

03:48.436 --> 03:50.021
Yeah! Slathered them.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.273
I've iced 'em. I've aired 'em out.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.860
Did you know that your dad comes in here
and grabs coffee at 10:45?

03:55.944 --> 03:59.113
I didn't. Close fucking call.
Good thing I had oven mitts.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.202
I know breastfeeding
is the best thing for her

04:04.285 --> 04:07.247
and it's supposed to help bond us
but I don't know if I can keep doing this.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.165
Really?

04:10.208 --> 04:13.544
Isn't that breastfeeding supposed
to help the brain development?

04:13.628 --> 04:14.587
[Abby] Ow!

04:14.671 --> 04:16.381
I read that
in one of them books you gave me.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.592
Actually, I just flipped through it
and looked at pictures of boobs.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.970
Brain development?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.806
[laughs] Weren't you breastfed
till you were two or three?

04:24.889 --> 04:26.975
-Yeah, exactly.
-[Abby laughs]

04:27.725 --> 04:29.644
What, you saying that's good or bad?

04:31.854 --> 04:34.482
You're... so strong and handsome, Colt.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.735
Aw, thank you.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.239
[huffs] I don't know.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.534
Maybe we should just switch to formula.
What do you think?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.870
Is this one of those situations where you
want me to be supportive

04:47.954 --> 04:49.330
or tell you to suck it up?

04:51.457 --> 04:54.252
-I want your honest opinion.
-Okay.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.336
Good.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.549
What do you want my honest opinion to be?

05:02.135 --> 05:06.097
This is my very first challenge as a mom
and I feel like I'm failing.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.891
No way, you ain't failin'.
Obviously, you're just doin' it wrong.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.897
Yeah, and you're not failing
as a husband, you're just doin' it wrong.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.566
[clears throat]

05:17.066 --> 05:18.276
Anything I can do to help?

05:18.860 --> 05:22.196
I need to numb 'em and we're out of ice.
Could you get me your frozen eye mask?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.824
Well, then I won't have it in the morning.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.994
-My T-zone's gonna be a mess.
-[Abby huffs]

05:29.620 --> 05:31.497
All right, fine, I'll get it.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.335
Oh, by the way,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.253
my dad told Luke he could stay here.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.922
I don't want you or Peyton
anywhere near him.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.215
That guy's bad news.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.509
Oh, I don't know, he seems fine.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.803
-Oh, really?
-Your dad thinks he's a good guy.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.388
A good guy?

05:48.014 --> 05:51.392
What? Does a good guy try to rip your head
off 'cause you broke a light bulb?

05:51.476 --> 05:55.605
You shoved a guy at the Broncos game
'cause he bumped into your churro.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.148
-No.
-What?

05:57.231 --> 05:59.734
He snapped it in half.
I had to eat it off the ground.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.904
And I'll say what I said then,
you didn't have to eat it!

06:03.821 --> 06:06.074
Babe, just 'cause we're in a VIP suite

06:06.157 --> 06:08.159
does not mean that we're too good
for floor food.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.920
You put all the tools away...

06:20.588 --> 06:21.923
in the right place.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.385
Are you proud of me or mad at me?

06:27.011 --> 06:29.305
Oh, my God! Is this what it's like
to have a dad?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.476
Sorry, I'm just not used to it.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.938
I once found a screwdriver
embedded in a tree.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.982
Turned out the boys were using
the air compressor

06:40.066 --> 06:41.442
to fire 'em at each other.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.405
Look real close at Colt's left arm,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.824
you can still see
a little Phillips head there.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.165
Hey!

06:56.582 --> 06:58.626
-[Beau] Hey!
-Hi!

06:58.709 --> 07:01.170
Son, we say "hey" around here.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.799
Okay.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.386
Thank you so much
for letting me stay in your cabin.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.054
If you'd like, I could pay rent.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.015
Oh, my God, you wanna pay something?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.310
He put the tools away, too.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.980
Okay, it's not genetics.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.773
We were terrible parents.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.902
Look, I just came by to get
Rooster's stuff out of the cabin

07:24.986 --> 07:27.071
'cause I have to go back down
to Florida tomorrow.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.865
What happened?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.199
Karen take a turn?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.870
Y'know, cancer's the only thing
that likes hanging out with her.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.457
Jesus, that's--

07:37.540 --> 07:40.251
No, it's okay, she's a terrible sister.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.840
I'm sorry she's sick... erm...

07:46.632 --> 07:48.426
Please give Aunt Karen my regards.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.471
Also, explain to Aunt Karen
who the fuck I am.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.431
[bike engine]

07:55.766 --> 07:57.602
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.561
See?

08:01.105 --> 08:02.732
I got a calf missing.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.859
Think we got another wolf?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.402
Didn't see a carcass.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.362
There's tire tracks at the west gate.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.116
Oh, shit, it's a wolf with a truck.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.162
Last night, when I was walking home

08:16.245 --> 08:18.789
I saw a blue Nissan truck
on your property.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.249
There you go.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.460
Gotta be Toby Henderson.

08:23.211 --> 08:27.215
We got a neighbor with an idiot son
who helps himself to a calf here 'n' there

08:27.298 --> 08:31.052
and he sells them at auction
for an easy 500 bucks.

08:31.135 --> 08:34.263
With assholes like this, how we
s'posed to make America great again, Dad?

08:36.015 --> 08:36.849
[Colt] Huh?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.144
All right, fuck it. I'm going over there.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.979
That calf doesn't have a brand yet.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.107
And Peterson never earmarked his calves.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.442
You can't prove it's yours.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.947
Unless you catch that dipshit in the act,
that's just the cost of doing business.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.992
So what? I'm just supposed to do nothin'?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.328
Yeah, that don't seem right to me, either.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.288
Take it easy, I got this, spark plug.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.127
I can call his dad
but you know he's just gonna deny it.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.257
Guy's a real piece of work.
Grumpy asshole.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.177
Just hides out at the ranch all day,
complainin' about everything.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.430
[chuckling]

09:17.682 --> 09:18.891
Oh, my God, your dad!

09:20.101 --> 09:21.852
You do joke around, that's good.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.064
Knock knock.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.153
You want me to bring you anything
back from Florida?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.280
[he scoffs]

09:32.822 --> 09:36.617
Hey, how about a shirt that says,
"We kept Gore out of the White House"?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.579
I already got one.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.874
I'm really sorry
you gotta deal with all that.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.335
She's my sister.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.671
It's just like you helping out Greg's son.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.965
No, I mean going to Florida.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.633
It's like California,

09:52.717 --> 09:56.304
except instead of giving us Reagan,
they gave us Jeb.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.270
Mary, what the fuck?!

10:05.104 --> 10:06.564
Oh, hey! What's up?

10:06.647 --> 10:10.151
I, er... left some stuff here,
and I didn't want to bother you.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.821
So, there it is.
This blanket belonged to my grandmother.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.780
It's a...

10:18.159 --> 10:19.827
I think we all know why you're here.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.786
We do?

10:21.954 --> 10:25.124
She's been stealing from me
and trying to pin it on Maria,

10:25.207 --> 10:27.251
and I'm pretty sure
you have a drug problem.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.086
Is that true?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.005
No! No, it is not true.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.549
Would you stop spreading rumors about me?

10:33.633 --> 10:37.303
Jesus. I haven't thrown a punch since
Black Friday, but you are pissing me off

10:37.386 --> 10:40.014
way more than that pregnant lady
who wanted the last Nintendo.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.934
All right, Mary,
I think it'd be best if you go.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.812
If we find anything that belongs to you,
we'll let you know.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.439
All right.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.523
Thank you, Beau.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.111
If you find a set of handcuffs,
I'm gonna need those back.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.239
They... also belonged to my grandmother.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.788
How long has this been goin' on?

11:04.747 --> 11:06.415
Oh, I don't know.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.542
A few weeks that I know of.

11:09.627 --> 11:13.839
I actually caught her stealing pills from
Janice's purse the day Peyton was born.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.508
Janice takes pills?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.510
That's not good.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.053
I thought she was just a drunk.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.016
Is there something we should be doing
to help Mary?

11:26.018 --> 11:26.936
You know what?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.980
All I do is help people.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.732
I'm gonna let someone else handle this.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.152
Wait a second! I'm willing
to help somebody and you're not?

11:35.903 --> 11:37.863
And now I'm trying
to talk to you about it?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.241
What the <i>fuck</i> is goin' on?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.244
Y'know...

11:44.745 --> 11:47.748
in grief counseling the other day,
this guy,

11:47.832 --> 11:48.916
Paul,

11:48.999 --> 11:52.628
he was talking about his son,
he was killed in a car crash.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.632
Apparently, his buddy
was texting and driving.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.093
The driver lived.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.889
And whenever Paul sees that kid,
he gets filled with anger.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.851
That's how I feel when I see Mary.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.354
Maggie, we've been through this.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.857
It was an accident.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.735
Yeah.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.405
But if Mary hadn't have been in his life,
there would have been no accident.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.368
So, Colt,

12:25.786 --> 12:27.621
how's being a dad?

12:27.705 --> 12:29.707
Well, it's great.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.211
I wish my teacher could see me now.

12:36.046 --> 12:36.922
Why?

12:37.006 --> 12:40.676
I broke like five of them egg babies
you're supposed to keep alive.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.389
Old Peyton, she only slipped
out of my hands like once.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.018
The trick is to boil 'em.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.775
The eggs.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.947
-Hey Colt, you got a minute?
-Come on, man.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.658
I just wanna enjoy one beer in peace

13:04.742 --> 13:06.494
before I gotta go back to baby duty.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.704
That's your third.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.626
Who are you? Fucking beer police?

13:15.252 --> 13:18.088
If I said yes,
can I confiscate that Budweiser?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.507
[chuckles]

13:20.341 --> 13:21.383
Shit!

13:22.510 --> 13:23.636
Found your cow.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.138
What?

13:27.056 --> 13:30.142
Saw that blue Nissan,
followed it back to the ranch.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.395
Had to be that Toby guy.
He was shooting arrows in the air

13:33.479 --> 13:35.356
and trying to avoid them
when they came down.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.443
He dodged three out of four of them, so...

13:41.612 --> 13:42.655
Fucking idiot.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.242
You gotta light 'em on fire
so you can see 'em come back in.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.413
Yeah, that's the smart way. Erm...

13:54.166 --> 13:57.586
He left so I snooped around and I found
a calf in there without an ear tag.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.298
-Fuckin' knew it.
-Mm-hm.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.301
I'm thinking we should go over there
and get that back tonight.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.222
I'll do it myself.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.058
Okay, lone wolf.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.227
Look, we don't have to be best friends,

14:13.310 --> 14:15.062
you don't gotta follow me on Instagram.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.943
Although if you did, you'd get to watch
my marriage of five years fall apart.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.446
Guy she left me for
is in three of the pictures.

14:26.532 --> 14:30.536
Kinda like <i>Where's Waldo?</i>
if Waldo was raw-dogging your wife.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.210
I'm thinking, hey,
we go over there tonight in my truck,

14:38.294 --> 14:39.920
they're not gonna recognize it.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.343
We got plenty of hell getting that calf
in the back of my Bronco.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.221
[sighs]

14:49.305 --> 14:52.558
All right, screw it.
Meet me in the driveway at nine o'clock.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.852
All right, see you then.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.478
See ya!

14:56.562 --> 14:59.565
By the way, you look better
since you trimmed your beard, Rooster.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.196
The fuck's the matter with you?

15:11.660 --> 15:12.494
[door knocks]

15:12.578 --> 15:14.246
-Hello?
-Hey Luke!

15:14.330 --> 15:17.750
Hey! Was getting stuff out of my truck
and I noticed the light on.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.461
As I was opening the door, I thought,

15:20.544 --> 15:23.631
a lot of scary movies start with a guy
checking on a cabin in the woods.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.134
Most notably the film <i>Cabin in the Woods.</i>

15:28.135 --> 15:31.096
No, there's only one scary guy
with a chainsaw around here

15:31.180 --> 15:34.183
and he's usually complaining
about how it was put away wrong.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.978
You sure you're fine with me staying?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.521
No, absolutely.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.440
I'm glad you're here.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.777
I haven't seen Beau this happy since,

15:45.361 --> 15:47.529
-I dunno, the NHL went on strike.
-[laughs]

15:49.490 --> 15:51.909
Yeah, I wish Colt
was a little more thrilled with it.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.662
Although I think I came up with a plan
to win him over.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.539
D'you know what rose hips are
or where I could buy them?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.085
Don't worry about Colt.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.461
He's been through a lot.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.004
Yeah.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.966
Beau told me about Rooster.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.885
It's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.598
The worst part is,
he really shouldn't be gone.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.767
And he wouldn't have been if it wasn't...

16:16.850 --> 16:19.979
It doesn't matter. I shouldn't
be dumping any of this on you.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.730
[Luke] No, it's...

16:22.898 --> 16:25.442
fine with me, I... totally understand.

16:27.611 --> 16:31.031
When people die it's really hard
not to obsess over why it happened.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.411
My mom died of lung cancer,
never smoked a cigarette her whole life.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.413
I'm sorry.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.373
The whole time...

16:39.832 --> 16:42.584
I was going through that with her
I was just so pissed, y'know?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.128
Just looking for some kind of...

16:44.920 --> 16:46.839
explanation or someone to blame and...

16:47.881 --> 16:50.634
y'know, I was like...
her ex-boyfriend who smoked around her

16:50.718 --> 16:53.887
or the factory she worked in,
the doctors that missed it.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.349
I was driving myself crazy,
and finally she said,

16:57.433 --> 16:59.101
"Luke, you gotta...

16:59.184 --> 17:01.937
let all that anger go,
it's not gonna help you."

17:03.230 --> 17:06.358
And she sent me over to the liquor store
to get her a pack of Parliaments

17:06.442 --> 17:08.444
'cause she said,
"If I'm going to die of this,

17:08.527 --> 17:10.362
I don't wanna go out like a pussy."

17:11.280 --> 17:14.616
Well, you seem to be handling it
pretty well.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.076
You think?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.663
If you remember, when you met me,
I was falling out of a cop car drunk,

17:19.747 --> 17:21.582
so, I wouldn't say I'm crushing it.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.335
No, I wasn't even here when Rooster died.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.922
I just wish I could talk to him
one more time.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.924
What do you think he'd say?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
Oh... I don't know.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.640
Probably, "Don't waste your time
crying about me."

17:40.100 --> 17:44.063
Or, "Don't let Colt forget who the real
father of his daughter is."

17:47.441 --> 17:48.609
I wish I could've met him.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.864
Any guy with a shirt that says,
"I can't drive 55, but I can drive .08,"

17:53.947 --> 17:55.282
is my kind of people.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.456
Fucking Toby.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.459
Still laying down hay.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.880
How can you do something so wrong
and take so long to do it?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.883
God, I'm turning into my dad.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.845
So your mom's bar, Maggie's,

18:17.596 --> 18:19.014
it's a pretty great place.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.392
-Yep.
-Must've been fun growing up around that.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.520
Back in Detroit...

18:25.395 --> 18:28.565
our hangout wasn't a bar so much
as a boarded-up house

18:28.649 --> 18:30.400
we'd pry open and drink forties in.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.113
There <i>was</i> always a guy in there
that looked like Hank, though.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.491
Look, we don't have to talk.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.410
You're just here 'cause I needed a truck.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.287
All right.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.291
Look, I know you're still mad
about yesterday. I get it.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.503
I'm sorry I snapped like that.

18:50.712 --> 18:51.880
It's fine.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.298
No, it's not fine.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.927
Just, y'know,
sometimes shit sets me off.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.555
Loud noise. Crowds.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.725
Last year, I ruined Mardi Gras
for a lot of people.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.772
All right, no offense, but...

19:10.107 --> 19:12.943
just 'cause you're saying you're sorry
don't make me feel any safer

19:13.026 --> 19:14.403
about having you around my family.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.698
All right,

19:17.781 --> 19:19.741
I get that, but...

19:19.825 --> 19:22.619
Colt, I would never hurt your family.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.371
-Mm-hm?
-Ever.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.457
If you knew what kinda guy
I really was, you'd see that.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.209
I saw what kinda guy you really were.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.462
No, you didn't see what kinda guy
I really am. You saw me at a bad moment.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.132
I wish it hadn't happened, but it did.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.967
And if the roles were reversed,

19:37.050 --> 19:38.802
it was you that was fucked up...

19:39.261 --> 19:41.972
I might not trust you at first,
but I'd give you a chance.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.809
Oh, shit, he's gone. Let's go!

19:50.898 --> 19:51.773
Ow!

19:52.274 --> 19:54.359
Okay, Peyton, it's not a <i>piñata.</i>

19:54.443 --> 19:55.986
There's nothing better inside.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.532
Everything all right?

20:00.616 --> 20:03.994
Yeah, I'm fine. But I don't think you want
to get in the middle of this.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.788
Oh, I was great with the boys
when they were babies.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.375
It's after they started to talk
that things went south.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.297
All right, well...

20:15.923 --> 20:18.550
I mean, it hurts when I nurse Peyton

20:18.634 --> 20:21.220
because my nipples
are all cracked and bleeding.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.431
Oh, well...

20:25.307 --> 20:26.183
Hey!

20:26.266 --> 20:27.851
Thank God, Maggie!

20:30.771 --> 20:31.939
So good to see you.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.901
I haven't seen you this happy since
I walked in and told you Hillary lost.

20:38.946 --> 20:39.863
What's up?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.033
She's got a...

20:44.117 --> 20:44.993
teat problem.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.831
And talking to Beau isn't helping?

20:52.042 --> 20:54.086
Y'know, I do have a salve
that might help.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.630
I make it myself.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.257
Works great on the heifers.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.178
Yeah, well, this heifer's gonna pass.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.267
No, I used it.
It's all natural. It really does help.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.311
You have to be careful
walking through the field though,

21:11.395 --> 21:13.272
'cause those calves will chase you down.

21:15.148 --> 21:18.151
All right, what the hell.
I mean, I'm desperate, I'll try anything.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.778
I'll go get it.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.324
I usually slather it on with a paintbrush
but I guess you could do it by hand.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.497
What's goin' on?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.333
How long did you breastfeed the boys?

21:33.834 --> 21:36.503
Oh, Colt, about a year and a half.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.798
I had to cut Rooster off when he started
unbuttoning my shirt himself.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.139
I wanna do this but I'm exhausted.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.432
And it hurts.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.934
I feel like all I'm doing is feeding her.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.477
I wanna be a good mom.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.522
What are you talking about?
You're a great mom.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.482
Then why do I feel like I wanna bail out

21:57.566 --> 21:59.985
even though all the experts
in the books say tough it out?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.779
You gotta make that decision for yourself.

22:03.947 --> 22:07.284
I never thought I'd be the kind of parent
that would put a leash on their kid,

22:07.367 --> 22:09.328
but you lose them a few times in the mall,

22:09.411 --> 22:12.456
next thing, you're throwing a rope
around him and telling Sheila Manning

22:12.539 --> 22:14.541
she can worry about her own fuckin' kids.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.257
Yeah, I get it, I mean Colt still runs off
every time he sees a Cinnabon.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.512
Listen, I would encourage you
to stick with it.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.889
It does get easier.

22:28.972 --> 22:32.309
But, y'know,
it doesn't matter what my opinion is

22:32.893 --> 22:34.353
or anyone else's.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.439
It's your baby and your body.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.607
It's your decision.

22:39.399 --> 22:42.486
Wow, that would make a great
bumper sticker that Beau would hate.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.949
I just don't wanna screw things up
for Peyton.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.495
Listen to me,
Peyton's gonna be fine, right?

22:51.578 --> 22:53.663
As long as you love her
and you take care of her.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.543
Well, breastfeeding is no guarantee
of perfect children.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.213
Again, both Colt and Rooster
were breastfed.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.801
There you go!

23:13.892 --> 23:14.893
[mooing]

23:17.145 --> 23:18.146
[whispering] Okay.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.733
Get the rope around her neck
so we can get her in the truck.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.361
Out of context, that's a creepy sentence.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.405
-OK, the rabbit comes outta the hole...
-[cow moos]

23:26.488 --> 23:28.115
-Go!
-Around the tree...

23:28.198 --> 23:29.533
We're getting out of here.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.118
Mother Goose, tie a knot!

23:31.201 --> 23:33.703
-This is how I learned how to do it, okay?
-Do it faster!

23:33.787 --> 23:36.373
Great, now the rabbit got loose.
I gotta start over.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.542
Whoa!

23:38.708 --> 23:39.793
[whispering] Toby!

23:42.129 --> 23:43.797
-What do we do?
-What do you mean?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.132
We have to kill this guy.

23:45.966 --> 23:46.842
Yes.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.718
I'm fuckin' with you. Listen...

23:48.802 --> 23:51.054
You go get your cow, I'll handle the rest.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.681
What? That's your plan?

23:52.764 --> 23:54.307
What's your plan? Keep arguing about it?

23:55.016 --> 23:57.018
-You're right. Good point.
-Break!

23:58.437 --> 24:00.814
-Oh! Hey!
-What the hell are you doing in here?!

24:00.897 --> 24:02.023
You're trespassing!

24:02.107 --> 24:05.735
Okay, it's okay.
Listen, I <i>was</i> trespassing,

24:05.902 --> 24:07.904
but now I'm talking to a new friend.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.700
You got three seconds
to tell me what the hell's goin' on.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.369
I got something right here
that'll explain all this...

24:14.453 --> 24:15.579
Fuck you!

24:20.292 --> 24:21.918
I'm taking my fuckin' calf back!

24:22.544 --> 24:25.464
By the way, your Nissan Frontier,
makes America sad.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.758
Stay down. Anytime now.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.553
-[Colt] I'm getting her. All right.
-Okay.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.721
Shotgun! Shotgun!

24:32.804 --> 24:35.849
Hey, you laid the hay out wrong.
You gotta do better, Toby.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.438
All right, she's in.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.606
[gunshot]

24:42.731 --> 24:43.607
Holy shit!

24:43.690 --> 24:44.900
Go, go, go!

24:45.484 --> 24:46.651
Get fast!

24:46.735 --> 24:48.570
This is fuckin' awesome!

24:48.653 --> 24:51.114
-Hahaha!
-Wahaha!

24:51.948 --> 24:53.116
Fuck you, Toby!

24:53.200 --> 24:54.701
Fuck you!

25:00.749 --> 25:02.667
-Hey, Mary.
-Whaddya want?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.420
We need to talk.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.674
Look, if I want to be judged, I'd show
up for my indecent exposure hearing.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.969
I owe you an apology.

25:13.970 --> 25:17.516
I've been having a really hard time
since Rooster's gone.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.436
I thought it was easier to blame you
than deal with my own pain,

25:21.520 --> 25:24.981
but the truth is Rooster wouldn't want us
mad at each other.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.442
I know you're struggling as well.
I just wanna help.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.653
So, you're gonna give me my job back?

25:30.111 --> 25:32.239
Sorry, no, I can't do that.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.282
Then how the hell
are you gonna help me?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.535
I just thought I could help you, y'know,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.204
find a way to deal with your... problem.

25:39.287 --> 25:40.121
[sighs]

25:40.872 --> 25:42.415
What problem, Maggie?

25:43.416 --> 25:46.836
I would help you find a group
or a program or a rehab.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.297
-[laughs sarcastically]
-I hear they're really nice now.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.924
I have a friend who went to one.

25:51.007 --> 25:54.386
She said as soon as you get past
the cavity search it's just like a spa.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.515
I don't...

25:58.598 --> 26:00.767
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you,

26:00.850 --> 26:03.353
I don't have a fucking problem, all right?

26:03.436 --> 26:06.231
So, stop pretending
like you're here for me, okay?

26:06.314 --> 26:07.315
You're here for you.

26:07.941 --> 26:08.942
You feel guilty?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.610
All right, let me help ya.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.862
I don't need you to give a shit about me.

26:14.030 --> 26:14.906
I'm fine.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.665
[Luke] When's the last time
you had a can of Planters Peanuts?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.001
Because I think you're picturing
somethin' else.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.545
-What are you talking about?
-What I'm saying is...

26:29.129 --> 26:30.880
That's Mr. Peanut's body.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.341
There aren't dick and balls
inside of his shell.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.763
Yeah, there are.

26:38.847 --> 26:42.934
The shell, that's not part of his outfit,
it's like the top hat and monocle.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.897
He's a businessman
dressed as a business peanut.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.318
Oh, okay.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.903
And then, by that logic, the Kool-Aid guy,

26:53.987 --> 26:56.740
he's a businessman
and he's dressed as a business pitcher?

26:59.159 --> 27:02.287
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I ain't gonna waste my time.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.498
-Okay.
-[scoffs]

27:07.417 --> 27:10.462
Hey... thanks for your help.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.922
Yeah, no problem.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.677
Wanna grab a beer?

27:19.512 --> 27:20.889
Yeah. You sure?

27:20.972 --> 27:23.141
Yeah. Peyton's probably still awake.

27:23.683 --> 27:24.726
You wanna meet her, right?

27:25.310 --> 27:26.728
Yeah, I'd like that.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.104
Then get off your ass.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.444
Hey, let me ask you a question.

27:34.527 --> 27:38.114
How is it that a light bulb sets you off

27:38.198 --> 27:40.950
but shotgun blasts
and you're totally fine?

27:42.577 --> 27:46.039
I think when I'm spooked,
doesn't go well,

27:46.122 --> 27:48.750
but I was pretty fucking sure
that guy was gonna shoot at us.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.586
Makes sense.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.133
All right, Michelin Man...
Dick or no dick?

27:57.217 --> 28:00.428
Oh, dick for days. How do you think
he fathered the Pillsbury Doughboy?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.639
-Yeah. All girth, huh?
-Mm-hm.
