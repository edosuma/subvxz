00:01.440 --> 00:03.112
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.111
So, are we staying yet?

00:05.200 --> 00:06.952
Are we exclusive yet?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.431
Game on, Brooke Davis.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.357
I would like to say something.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.556
Mayor Mullins, I object.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.071
Well, this is not a court of law, Dan.
Sit down.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.355
- I'm still your father.
- But you're not my father, are you?

00:29.440 --> 00:31.271
Divorce is fine, Deb.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.239
You seem surprised.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.829
Here.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.839
It's my cocaine vial.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.511
Thought you might like it,
considering you were buying drugs today.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.319
Ellie was buying marijuana.
But not for the reasons you think.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.637
She's sick. She has cancer, Peyton.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.592
<i>Always and forever.</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:55.798
That's what sucks, Haley.
I still do love you.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.757
I just can't trust you.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.031
- No way, Hales.
- Let me see it.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.908
- I look like an idiot.
- Dude, I saw you in your headgear.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.189
Don't call me dude.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.191
And I thought we promised
not to talk about that in public.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.508
Whatever, dude.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.671
Look, I'm counting to three,
and then I'm coming in there.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.193
One, two...

02:51.080 --> 02:53.036
Okay, this is hot.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.190
- Excuse me?
- Well, I mean...

02:55.760 --> 02:58.797
No, not that I noticed or that I could ever
possibly think of you that way.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.393
I just... Okay.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.588
Look, this party's my one chance
to get Brooke to finally rethink

03:03.680 --> 03:05.477
this whole non-exclusive thing.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.952
Just be all exclusive.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.715
Do you think she'll like it?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.234
I don't know, you're asking me to enter
the sexual mind of Brooke Davis?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.754
- She's your roommate.
- She's your girlfriend.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.678
Sort of, kind of.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.637
All right, let me see what I can find out.
I'll do a little roommate recon for you.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.392
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, darling.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.478
Now it's your turn.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.429
I see a belly-dancer costume
with your name on it, love.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.837
- Nathan won't know what hit him.
- Please.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.629
I could go naked to this stupid party
and it wouldn't make a difference.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.794
Okay.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.633
Well, well, well. Mayor Mullins.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.792
What have we here? Sex scandal 101?

03:49.480 --> 03:53.029
Handcuffs, cocaine, skanky hookers.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.518
No offense, ladies.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.673
So what's your preference?
Video or stills?

03:59.520 --> 04:02.876
Then again, I'm a businessman.
We could make a deal.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.155
You drop your bid for re-election
and resign immediately,

04:07.840 --> 04:09.831
and this video goes away.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.440
Good boy. At least you're a smart pervert.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.269
Oh, by the way,
you're gonna endorse me for mayor.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.558
Hey, knock knock.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.077
- I'm making lunch. You hungry?
- Not really.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.109
Come on.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.873
You've seen enough <i>Afterschool Specials</i>
to know that you've got to eat.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.191
I know. I will, just not right now.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.995
Okay. What are you going as?

04:44.160 --> 04:48.597
- An angel. Brooke's gonna be the devil.
- Oh. Imagine that.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.315
I'm just not really feeling it.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.432
All right.
Well, if you get hungry, let me know.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.635
Hey.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.834
Look, I know, all right, about Ellie.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.115
What?

05:04.760 --> 05:07.877
Did you think, like,
I couldn't handle it, or...

05:06.120 --> 05:07.792
'Cause if you were keeping it
from me, then...

05:09.440 --> 05:10.714
I wasn't.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.475
I wasn't. I didn't know.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.832
Well, now you do.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.079
- I'm sorry.
- No.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.511
Guess my moms are just
dropping like flies, huh?

05:26.920 --> 05:30.356
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just savoring the Indian summer.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.236
Well, savor it at the beach house, Dan.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.474
It's what you'll get in the divorce
if you'll just sign the damn papers already.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.671
You mean these papers?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.399
I'll sign them for you
right now, sweetheart.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.039
Thank you.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.114
I just need you to sign these for me.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.471
- Declaration of candidacy?
- I'm running for mayor.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.993
You're running against Mullins,
a ten-year incumbent? Fat chance.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.797
Guess you didn't hear.
Mullins resigned this morning.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.034
Shocking.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.109
Fine.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.954
Run for mayor. Run for
Miss Teen North Carolina for all I care.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.989
- At least I won't be around to watch.
- Don't be so sure.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.793
Check the date.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.913
You postdated this
for two months from now.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.793
Dan, why don't you just go
and quit torturing me?

06:42.160 --> 06:43.513
I will.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.037
In 60 days after we play house
and show the Tree Hill voters

06:46.360 --> 06:48.476
what a great family man Dan Scott is.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.916
- Appearances are everything, right, Deb?
- Why are you doing this?

06:51.760 --> 06:53.557
Because Mullins got in my way
with Whitey,

06:55.200 --> 06:57.316
and I don't like it
when people get in my way.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.310
Besides, I've got money
and I've got freedom.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.236
At least I will, when I get rid of you.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.716
Only thing left is power.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.959
Forget it.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.871
Well, what about Nathan?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.309
If you stick around
for the next two months,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.397
I'll leave him alone.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.518
I could turn him against you, Deb.
But if you stay with me,

07:19.320 --> 07:21.629
I'll back off for as long as you like.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.959
Who knows,

07:28.480 --> 07:31.313
after 60 days,
you may fall in love with me again.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.509
You want us to live together, fine.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.437
I've been pretending to love you
for a long time now, Dan.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.517
Sixty days is nothing.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.957
Mayor Dan Scott. I like it.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.399
New tune?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.318
Sounds pretty good. Speed it up a little.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.554
Faster.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.714
Faster.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.109
Sorry.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.715
You know, the devil doesn't have sequins
or feathers or breasts, for that matter.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.549
Well, in my universe, she does.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.435
- Did you even follow the pattern?
- No.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.317
- Brooke, you have to do that.
- Says who?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.598
Says, like, every sewing teacher ever.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.318
Otherwise you'll end up
with something like...

08:24.560 --> 08:25.879
Like this?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.236
That looks really good.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.879
Thank you. I just whipped it up.
Now what are we gonna do for you?

08:31.360 --> 08:35.511
I was thinking sexy nurse,
Catholic schoolgirl, Playboy Bunny...

08:34.080 --> 08:35.832
No, no, and forget it.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.674
Haley, it's a costume party.
You just go as a sexy whatever.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.674
- All right. Well, sexy, not slutty.
- Fine.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.953
Oh, I know.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.997
The classic "get my man to see me
in a new light" costume.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.590
How about a classic "get my man
to come to this thing" costume?

08:51.560 --> 08:53.152
You got one of those?
'Cause I'm not even sure

08:53.880 --> 08:55.518
Nathan's showing up at this thing.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.835
Well, you're gonna make my job easy
this year.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.754
There's nothing worse than
cheering for a bunch of losers.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.512
Well, it's all about you, Brooke. What's up?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.430
Are you going to this masquerade party
at Tric?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.672
Wasn't planning on it. Why?

09:10.240 --> 09:12.037
Just figured it might be
the perfect occasion

09:12.080 --> 09:14.230
to stop punishing your wife.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.916
Haley's really hurting, Nathan.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.159
I mean, come on, how hard would it be
to stop by and smile at her

09:18.560 --> 09:21.597
- and tell her she looks cute?
- Harder than you think.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.999
She hasn't written a song
since you guys split up.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.915
I guess her talent was tied to you.
No Nathan, no music.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.591
- She put you up to this?
- No.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.359
But if I hear one more accidental cover
of <i>Wind Beneath My Wings,</i>

09:36.200 --> 09:40.159
I am going to slit my wrists.
So, please, Nathan, do it for me.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.595
And besides, when I get through with her,
she's gonna look hot as hell.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.670
You can trust me. I'm the devil.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.156
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.671
Hey. So did you talk to Brooke
about my costume yet?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.675
Yeah.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.031
How do you feel about head-to-toe tattoos
and a nose ring?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.719
- Not good.
- Okay. Well, think about it, Tommy Lee.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.992
I got to dump these.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.195
What is this, some kind of California thing
Brooke picked up in the OC?

10:15.360 --> 10:17.635
I'm sure it goes back further than that.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.759
Hey, since when is Brooke
such a metal-head, anyway?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.439
I don't know.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.199
I guess even after all this time,
people can still surprise you.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.190
- Is it true? Do you have cancer?
- Yes.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.754
- Is Peyton at risk?
- She might be.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.599
But only 10% of all breast cancers
are genetic.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.548
- Is yours one of them?
- I don't know.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.475
So at some point down the line,
you should get her checked.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.358
And what about you?

11:15.120 --> 11:19.079
Well, I was in remission for a while.
Not anymore.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.518
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.996
It's not how I pictured my life turning out,
that's for sure.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.956
I know it's crazy,
but I can't help feeling like

11:31.280 --> 11:33.840
it's some kind of karmic payback,
you know?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.595
Yeah, I don't think it works like that.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.476
Is this why you came back,
to make things right with Peyton?

11:38.560 --> 11:42.269
I wanted her and you to be aware
of her genetic history.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.596
And sure, I wanted to get to know her.
I wanted her to get to know me.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.273
- So she could lose another mother.
- No, that is exactly what I didn't want.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.518
I was still in remission
when I first got here.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.315
And don't worry.
I am not about to let her watch me die.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.957
Look, Ellie, I am sorry for everything
that you are going through.

12:04.280 --> 12:08.034
But you understand that I have to think
about Peyton first, last, always.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.437
Oh, you mean
now that you're back in town? Like me?

12:11.240 --> 12:14.471
- No, nothing like you, actually.
- Larry!

12:14.360 --> 12:15.634
I'm sorry.

12:19.760 --> 12:24.197
If you want me to leave for good this time,
just say the word.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.197
She's your daughter now. It's up to you.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.190
- Is that one of ours?
- Inspired by.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.198
- But I made a few modifications.
- Like what?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.471
Well, if you cut the leg higher,
it's less coverage,

12:51.440 --> 12:53.112
but it's actually more flattering.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.035
And a halter is way better
for faking buff Madonna arms.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.397
Interesting,
but the devil doesn't have feathers.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.156
What is with you people?
So she's a feathery devil.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.195
Hi!

13:06.480 --> 13:09.278
- Is that your costume?
- Is that yours?

13:07.680 --> 13:11.753
- Maybe. I think you'll like it.
- I know I will.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.312
You might wanna warn
your other boyfriends

13:14.720 --> 13:16.551
if they plan on seeing you at the party.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.676
I think you're gonna be all tied up,
so to speak.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.153
Really? Well, a girl can dream.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.557
But I thought you were playing
hard-to-get.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.556
Actually, I believe you're the one
playing hard-to-get.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.755
Doesn't mean we can't have
a whole lot of fun in the meantime.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.229
Just means we'll be wearing a whole lot
more clothes while we're having it.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.031
Right. Commitment thing.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.991
Think my costume's gonna help you
change your mind.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.317
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but do you have a matching thong?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.756
Oh, you know it, sister.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.957
- What the hell is this?
- New campaign, new wardrobe.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.910
And that "candidate's wife" look
doesn't come cheap.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.273
Appearances are everything. Right, Dan?

14:07.240 --> 14:09.276
Bedroom's this way, boys.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.754
Peyton?

14:22.040 --> 14:23.678
Peyton, listen...

14:28.840 --> 14:32.469
- I thought you were going as an angel.
- I am. I'm the Angel of Death.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.836
Thought it was appropriate.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.829
Honey.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.278
You know the worst part
about your mom dying?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.916
I have to pick just one?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.836
How suddenly she was gone.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.431
I mean, it was like,
one minute she was there,

14:57.920 --> 15:01.799
talking about what we were gonna have
for dinner, and the next, she was just

15:00.000 --> 15:01.115
gone.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.708
Forever.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.233
I kept thinking about all the things
I would have said to her if I had known.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.516
And then I realized
what I really had to worry about

15:18.440 --> 15:21.079
- was all the things I was gonna say to you.
- Daddy...

15:20.480 --> 15:21.708
Honey, you were so little

15:23.200 --> 15:26.192
and there was so much left to talk about
with Mom and...

15:24.520 --> 15:27.830
So many things she would have told you
as you grew up.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.799
So I started writing it all down,
whatever I could think of, you know.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.119
Her favorite color, her favorite food.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.556
Our first date, first kiss.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.276
But all that did was make me realize
all the things I didn't know.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.793
Things I couldn't know. Girl stuff.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.834
Like what she would have said to you
about sex,

15:48.400 --> 15:50.960
- or the day you got your first...
- Dad, I just...

15:51.000 --> 15:52.718
I know, honey, but...

15:53.640 --> 15:55.710
Don't you ever just wonder?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.874
Yeah. All the time.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.800
Well, now, Ellie

16:05.640 --> 16:08.598
has the one thing your mother didn't.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.916
She's got fair warning.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.513
There's time.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.309
Time for no regrets, no wondering.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.869
Maybe you should go see her. Talk to her.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.551
Let her answer any questions
that you might have.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.199
Like what?

16:31.040 --> 16:33.713
Like who your real father is.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.433
I think you make
a very pretty Angel of Death.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.114
Have fun.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.272
Hey, it's Nathan.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.509
We should get together tonight.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.751
There's this costume party.
We can meet up afterwards.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.996
And, hey, there's just one thing.
Haley can't know.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.793
Remember. No tugging.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.108
- Okay, but I've got a major...
- No tugging.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.275
God. You're tough.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.959
Any chance I can lose these heels
halfway through the night?

18:00.360 --> 18:03.591
No pain, no gain, girl.
Now get your game face on.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.479
Other game.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.391
Okay, we'll work on that.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.833
Hello, ladies.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.148
Mouth!

18:15.760 --> 18:17.955
You look incredible.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.190
Thanks. So do you. Wow.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.073
It's a good thing you and Lucas
are non-exclusive.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.955
So I guess you're over Erica.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.511
My girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.039
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mouth.
- No, I'm okay.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.596
I'm not gonna spend my senior year
chasing after someone

18:32.200 --> 18:34.395
that doesn't care about me anymore.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.437
Yeah, that's really smart.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.029
Yes.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.712
Slower, slower.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.079
That's it.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.558
- Where the hell is my bed?
- Hi, Dan. Nice to see you, too.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.393
- Where is all my stuff, Deb?
- I gave it away.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.310
- You what?
- I had to. It was all wet and smelly.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.037
- And how did that happen?
- The sprinklers came on by accident

19:09.680 --> 19:12.433
after I tossed everything out the window.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.871
That part was on purpose.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.837
Besides, I had to make room
for Hans to whip me

19:17.840 --> 19:19.193
into shape.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.669
A politician's wife has to look the part.
Right, Dan?

19:23.640 --> 19:26.837
I guess you'll have to find
someplace else to sleep.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.239
Nice wings.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.678
Nathan? I couldn't even tell it was you.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.877
This is how I can see everything
and pretend like I was never even here.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.878
Very sneaky, Bruce.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.317
Hate to say it,
but your wife looks pretty hot.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.191
Haley always looks hot.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.396
Hey. You look great.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.909
Are you talking to me yet?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.754
Not really,
but I guess you're talking to me.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.356
Peyton, I don't understand
why you're so pissed off.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.760
Really? You come back to town
after months of being away

20:16.240 --> 20:19.232
- and try to pretend like nothing happened.
- I'm not pretending anything.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.916
I'm just...
I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch with you.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.157
- It was hard to keep up with people.
- Haley, it wasn't me, okay?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.594
I'm not that needy.
But you didn't even call Nathan.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.429
I did call.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.758
And anyway, I just don't like what you did.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.997
But you know what,
your husband just said you look hot.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.037
So if you do still love him, there's your in.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.316
- Hey, Peyton, I love your costume.
- Mouth! Look at you!

20:50.120 --> 20:52.588
You're, like, the hottest guy here.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.278
- Oh, no.
- Oh, nice.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.600
- Wait till Brooke sees him.
- She's gonna love it, right?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.793
No. She thinks Mötley Crüe is like,
the least sexy band of all time.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.397
We got to tell Lucas.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.476
Oh, no, you didn't.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.070
- I did.
- You are so gullible. Tommy Lee?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.878
- What?
- He's, like, 40, and looks like that.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.354
- You set me up?
- You should have been a pirate.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.073
You know, nothing like
a little Johnny Depp

21:29.080 --> 21:31.275
to make a girl want to commit.

21:30.680 --> 21:35.117
I heard we got back together again.
Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.555
Right.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.188
At the very least, we did just have
a hot weekend together in Vegas.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.272
You want to dance?

21:45.120 --> 21:48.032
- Unless you're seeing someone.
- No.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.433
Not exclusively.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.954
You okay?

22:02.800 --> 22:03.994
Peachy.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.274
- Excuse me?
- Hiya, wifey.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.869
You told me to find another place to sleep.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.992
In the buff, naturally, since, thanks to you,
some homeless person has all my clothes.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.549
Great way to kick off
my humanitarian campaign, though.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.118
Forgot to thank you for that.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.350
Would you care to join me,
or would you rather sleep on the floor?

22:45.600 --> 22:46.749
Fine.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.996
Sweet dreams, Danny boy.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.320
- Hey, have you seen Nathan?
- What's he dressed as?

23:19.200 --> 23:20.519
I don't know, actually.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.799
I know he's seen me, but
he's like the Invisible Man or something.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.708
Haley, are you okay?

23:27.560 --> 23:29.357
Yeah, if okay is, like,
heels that are killing me

23:30.720 --> 23:32.312
an underwire that's digging
into my ribcage,

23:32.600 --> 23:33.999
and I'm about five minutes
from going home

23:34.280 --> 23:36.748
- and binging on cookie dough.
- That's not what I mean.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.637
There's money missing
from the register at the café.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.197
Now, I've noticed a pattern
in the past couple of weeks

23:40.280 --> 23:42.191
and it always finds its way back
right after payday.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.673
- But that's not the point.
- Karen, I...

23:44.240 --> 23:48.233
Look, I know your parents are gone,
and I know that things are a bit tight.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.159
Was it you?

23:49.840 --> 23:50.955
Yeah.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.953
I'm really sorry.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.872
So am I, that you didn't feel that
you could come to me

23:56.320 --> 23:59.118
and ask if you needed help.
I thought we were closer.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.836
- We are. It won't happen again.
- Good.

24:02.280 --> 24:06.239
I want you to know that
I am always there for you no matter what.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.834
Thanks.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.035
Why don't I take this? Consider it interest.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.555
Okay.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.949
Hi.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.674
- Nice costume.
- You like it?

24:53.360 --> 24:54.713
Not really.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.634
I mean, it's just not really you.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, Brooke thought I could...

25:01.560 --> 25:04.074
I just wanted you to want me again.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.073
That's not the problem, Haley, trust me.

25:09.720 --> 25:13.076
I mean, a sexy makeover's
not gonna fix us, right?

25:12.920 --> 25:15.150
Yeah, you're right. I mean...

25:17.440 --> 25:19.510
I look ridiculous, don't I?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.594
- Haley, no...
- I'm sorry.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.150
- Having fun?
- Not really.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.239
I mean, I'm psyched to see the band,

25:41.240 --> 25:43.390
but I still had to force myself
to come here tonight.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.914
Me, too.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.758
- I'm just dealing with some personal stuff.
- Yeah, me, too.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.756
- And someone spilled soda on my wings.
- I think that was me.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.112
I got an idea how we could make
this night less sucky.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.958
- Are you propositioning me, Mouth?
- Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.319
To dance.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.990
Oh, my God. You were amazing.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.314
<i>All right!</i>

27:25.560 --> 27:28.996
<i>- Are you guys all ready for Fall Down Boy?</i>
- Fall Out Boy.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.353
<i>Right, right.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:33.273
<i>Anyway, do I hear a whoot-whoot?</i>

27:32.120 --> 27:34.236
<i>Guess not. All right. Well,</i>

27:40.920 --> 27:44.595
<i>without further ado, Fall Out Boy.</i>

27:43.880 --> 27:47.190
What are you doing?
The band is playing. You're missing it.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.474
- This is such a bad idea.
- But Nathan totally talked to you.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.998
He swooped in
like some kind of knight in Batman armor.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.349
That's not the point! I look like an idiot.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.797
Okay, maybe now that
you messed up your hair, but...

29:04.680 --> 29:05.795
This <i>Grease</i> thing is a lie.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.392
I mean, what,
you turn into some spandex-wearing,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.558
cigarette-smoking hussy
and you get your man?

29:09.680 --> 29:11.875
- That doesn't work.
- You were smoking?

29:11.480 --> 29:14.677
Even if it did, that's not who I am.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.519
I'm a tutor. I'm a nerd.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.479
Not anymore.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.193
I'm just Haley.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.430
That really should be enough.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.751
I'm done playing games, Brooke.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.591
I'm just gonna go home.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.229
- Okay.
- And there better be cookie dough.

29:38.280 --> 29:42.114
Hey, thank you for helping me earlier.
I'm sorry I freaked out like a baby.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.635
I just want things back the way they were.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.435
Hey.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.593
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.790
- I saw you take the plunge and...
- Nathan kissed me.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.071
- What?
- I didn't even know what was happening.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.558
It just...
It happened and then he was gone.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.316
- Did you go after him?
- No.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.553
It was just so romantic and perfect.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.196
And I just wanted to come right home
and not mess it up, you know.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.712
Well, then, I guess you're okay.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.438
Yeah. It was, like,
a totally out-of-body experience for me.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.998
Yeah, maybe I should
get Nathan to kiss me.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.792
Oh, shut up.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.229
- I'm gonna head home.
- Okay.

31:26.720 --> 31:30.349
Thanks for the costume advice.
Remind me to never have you spy for me.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.873
I'm sorry.

31:32.920 --> 31:36.071
Luke, there's just one more thing. I...

31:34.160 --> 31:36.993
Your mom thinks I stole money
from the café.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.111
- Why does she think that?
- 'Cause I told her I did.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.429
'Cause I was covering for you.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.116
I saw you take it and...

31:49.800 --> 31:51.631
What's going on, Luke?

31:53.120 --> 31:55.350
I needed to buy some medicine.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.554
For what?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.192
For my heart, Hales.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.833
I have HCM.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.519
Angel of Death. You're a little early.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.678
How was the show?

32:23.360 --> 32:26.238
- You want to come inside?
- I'm not staying.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.718
I'm still glad you came. You.
Not the death part.

32:37.880 --> 32:41.475
Look, I don't want to be curious about you,
but I can't help it. I am.

32:40.680 --> 32:44.116
Well, selfishly, I'm glad
that's one battle you're losing.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.713
- I'm just scared.
- Of what?

32:48.840 --> 32:52.435
Of forgetting my mom, okay? Anna.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.193
I used to have one of her T-shirts
that smelled like her,

32:57.320 --> 32:59.515
and I slept with it every night,

32:58.840 --> 33:02.515
until, one day, it started to smell
more like me than it did her.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.549
And so I took it out
and I tried every detergent I could find

33:09.760 --> 33:13.435
just trying to find that smell.
And I couldn't. It was gone.

33:12.320 --> 33:15.551
And so now sometimes I test myself,
you know,

33:17.640 --> 33:20.074
just to see if I can find that smell.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.271
And once in a while, I can.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.077
- But it's getting harder and harder.
- I understand.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.352
It's bad enough that you're, like,
really into music, okay?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.470
I don't want to find out
you're an artist, too.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.712
- Peyton...
- Because there are some things I know

33:37.160 --> 33:39.151
I got from her. I had to.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.834
And I don't wanna change that.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.358
Well, the tendency towards drugs,

33:44.160 --> 33:47.709
which I would love to yell at you about,
that's from me.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.349
But I can't draw to save my life.

33:51.120 --> 33:55.352
Those sketches I saw in your room,
that's from your mom.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.639
Know that.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.318
And as far as your dad's concerned,

34:01.600 --> 34:03.591
when he sent me away
all those years ago,

34:06.640 --> 34:08.072
it was the right move.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.914
I've done some pretty questionable things
in my life, Peyton.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.315
I would have sent me away, too.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.668
- But you're here now.
- That's right.

34:14.760 --> 34:18.275
And if you want to know things,
then I want you to know them.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.714
I'll tell you anything. Everything.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.795
And if you don't want to know,
that's okay, too.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.112
It's up to you.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.350
Well, well, we meet again.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.835
- Thanks for coming.
- How could I not?

34:35.120 --> 34:37.918
- You must have gotten my letter.
- Yeah, I got it.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.916
Did you like the perfume?
I'm kind of sexy like that sometimes.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.550
So what can Chris Keller do for you?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.877
He can help Haley with her music.

34:58.880 --> 35:02.190
No, I'm serious.
Apparently, she's hit some kind of slump.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.517
- And you care why?
- Because she loves it.

35:06.240 --> 35:10.074
- And I love her.
- Wow. How heroic.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.356
Or maybe just completely stupid.
I mean, why call me?

35:12.400 --> 35:16.393
'Cause even though you're an ass,
Haley's music came a long way with you.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.918
And you said in that letter
that you'd do anything to help her.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.713
This is it.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.588
Look, not that I don't love second chances,

35:28.480 --> 35:30.118
but what makes you think
you can trust me?

35:31.520 --> 35:34.193
Oh, I don't trust you. But Haley does.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.913
Besides, if you touch her, I'll crush you.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.278
Well, this is gonna cost you.

35:38.360 --> 35:42.035
I mean, we've got studio space,
first-class accommodations,

35:42.160 --> 35:44.390
my time, which is worth a lot.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.708
- And I'm kind of digging that watch.
- Don't screw with me, Keller.

35:51.640 --> 35:55.349
All right, tell you what,
give me the rest of this sandwich, I'm in.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.949
All right. It's a deal, then.
And this stays between us.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.158
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

36:02.640 --> 36:05.996
<i>I'm sorry, Deb.</i>
<i>I never meant for it to come to this.</i>

36:08.160 --> 36:11.038
I mean, we loved each other once,
didn't we?

36:27.840 --> 36:29.512
I know I loved you.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.510
- Dan, what are you doing?
<i>- I just had to talk to you.</i>

36:36.560 --> 36:40.872
Because I'm waiting for the glue to dry.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.036
You superglued the phone?

36:42.640 --> 36:45.473
You want to play with me, game on, bitch.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.833
Good night.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.917
Hey, how was the rest of your night?

37:01.320 --> 37:05.199
Well, Lucas thought he could make me
jealous with that <i>Baywatch</i> bimbo.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.556
Two can play at that game.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.154
Brooke.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.193
Be careful.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.268
His heart's more fragile than you think.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.749
<i>Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote,</i>

37:37.880 --> 37:40.952
<i>"There is no privacy</i>
<i>that cannot be penetrated.</i>

37:41.120 --> 37:44.112
<i>"No secret can be kept</i>
<i>in the civilized world. "</i>

38:07.280 --> 38:09.953
- Hey.
- You're still awake.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.275
Of course. That's what fathers do.
They wait up for their daughters.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.834
- Did you talk to Ellie?
- Yeah.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.875
Good.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.237
But I didn't have to ask
who my real father is.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.513
I already know.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.596
<i>"Society is a masked ball</i>

38:42.920 --> 38:45.639
<i>"where everyone hides his real character,</i>

38:46.280 --> 38:48.396
<i>"then reveals it by hiding."</i>
