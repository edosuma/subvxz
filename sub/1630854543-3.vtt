WEBVTT

00:13.039 --> 00:14.880
Lyra!

00:14.880 --> 00:16.440
Lyra, can you hear me?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.839
- Roger!
- Lyra!

00:19.559 --> 00:21.719
- Roger!
- Lyra!

00:22.800 --> 00:25.120
Just tell me
where you are and I'll find you!

00:27.879 --> 00:29.640
The land of the dead.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.200
What is it?

00:57.079 --> 00:58.520
It's nothing.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.920
Then what woke you?

01:05.519 --> 01:06.840
I've slept enough.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.879
- Was it another nightmare?
- No.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.200
- Then what?
- Just...

01:40.319 --> 01:42.159
too much to think about.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.840
Roger needs us.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.640
I need to go to the land of the dead
and put things right.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.959
You mean we need to.

01:53.519 --> 01:54.920
Whatever happens...

01:57.159 --> 01:58.439
we'll be together.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.640
Help me to understand... what happened.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.560
There were unexpected forces
around the girl.

02:09.439 --> 02:11.960
- Unexpected forces?
- Dark forces.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.159
Our soldiers saw the boy and the girl
disappear in thin air.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.120
I believe it would take
more than manpower to...

02:27.919 --> 02:29.360
eradicate her.

02:33.680 --> 02:37.680
That child cannot be allowed to live.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.159
HIS DARK MATERIALS

04:20.120 --> 04:22.439
Sir, your prisoner is awake.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.839
Very good.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.199
Quite a thing to see you like this.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.639
Hello, Asriel.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.639
You should find this
a touch more comfortable.

05:02.439 --> 05:04.480
Not that comfortable.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.600
You don't need to tie me up, Asriel.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.920
You are my prisoner.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.160
You're enjoying this aren't you?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.920
Still the same man.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.079
You could be standing here
beside me, you know?

05:22.079 --> 05:25.639
I gave you the choice in that
mountain top and you turned me down.

05:25.639 --> 05:28.319
Nope. Not the same man.

05:28.319 --> 05:31.480
- Even more petty.
- I think I'm rather unchanged.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.439
I've done exactly as I said I would.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.639
But you, you went back for her.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.120
And failed.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.319
Is she here?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.000
You still wear this?

05:51.079 --> 05:52.319
No, she's not.

05:53.279 --> 05:56.319
- Listen to me, she's in danger...
- No. No, I...

05:56.319 --> 05:59.199
Asriel, she's our daughter
and the Magisterium want her dead.

05:59.199 --> 06:01.639
I think you'll find
they want the pair of us dead too.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
Do you know what they say she is?

06:07.920 --> 06:11.079
- Hokum. Religious Hokum.
- Eve. Asriel.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.879
How could you and I
have produced another Eve?

06:14.879 --> 06:16.800
Well, the witches believe the same.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.399
Wretched girl should have stayed in
Jordan college and done as she was told.

06:20.399 --> 06:24.279
Fuss she has caused is out of proportion
with any of her merits...

06:24.279 --> 06:26.079
Remember who you're talking to.

06:27.079 --> 06:29.399
I do know you, Asriel.
You don't mean any of those words.

06:29.399 --> 06:33.000
Do not presume to tell me what I mean.

06:34.839 --> 06:36.199
You're right.

06:37.519 --> 06:38.839
I failed.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.439
And now you're the only one
who can help her.

06:54.439 --> 06:56.000
I have someone with her.

06:57.279 --> 07:00.040
- With Lyra?
- One of our best.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.720
She'll bring her here,
when the time is right.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.439
So, she's safe?

07:07.759 --> 07:09.399
You promise me she's safe?

07:11.759 --> 07:13.000
My word.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.839
That girl has cast
quite a spell on you, hasn't she?

07:25.360 --> 07:27.480
- Eyes on.
- Yes, sir.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.240
- Has the worst of it worn off?
- Feels like it.

08:02.279 --> 08:03.720
What she did to you...

08:05.000 --> 08:06.360
it's unforgiveable.

08:11.079 --> 08:12.600
You seem different.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.160
So do you.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.319
- You're staring
- I know.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.399
I just didn't think I'd see you again.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.000
Thank you for coming.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.560
- How long have you been there?
- I haven't been hiding.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.120
- You just haven't been looking.
- Why are you following us?

08:31.120 --> 08:33.320
I am a member
of Lord Asriel's Republic.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.399
I am here for you. And the girl.
And your knife.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.000
You're not in charge here, we are.

08:41.519 --> 08:43.320
Lyra and I need to talk in private.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.200
How do I know you won't just
cut into another world?

08:54.039 --> 08:55.440
Don't you trust us?

08:55.440 --> 08:56.879
What do you think?

08:58.399 --> 08:59.559
Fine.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.879
If I haven't got it, I can't use it.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.679
Is that really a good idea?
Won't she steal the knife?

09:25.679 --> 09:28.320
- It's broken.
- What? How?

09:28.879 --> 09:30.080
When I tried to get you.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.759
- It broke when you were with my mother?
- She made me think of my mother.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.000
And as I did, it broke.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.720
I left a window open to your world
but I think we're stuck.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.559
This might help.

09:59.759 --> 10:01.519
Always seems to come back to me.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.440
What happened to you, Will?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.080
I woke up and you were gone
and she was there and...

10:10.080 --> 10:11.600
I shouldn't have left you.

10:12.159 --> 10:15.080
- If I hadn't of left you...
- That's not what I'm saying.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.840
I just suddenly knew where he was.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.559
Your father?
You found him?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.080
Then he was gone.
Shot by a soldier.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.480
Don't know why.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.320
I'm so sorry, Will.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.399
Since he died, I've done none
of the things he asked me to do.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.639
Do you really have to go?

10:53.480 --> 10:57.440
- I'm sorry, I have to keep moving.
- Here.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.080
- Stay away from the city road.
- What's this?

11:01.080 --> 11:04.919
It's... a compass, torch,
some generally useful stuff.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.440
You've been very kind. I'll be careful.

11:45.759 --> 11:47.120
I've got an idea.

11:48.039 --> 11:49.639
I know who can fix the knife.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.879
Iorek understands metal.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.639
We can go through the window.
fix it and then...

11:55.639 --> 11:56.639
And then?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.840
Look, I know you won't want
to do this but my dad, before he died,

12:00.840 --> 12:02.919
told me that the knife's
needed in a war.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.320
He told me to take the knife to Asriel.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.080
No.

12:09.039 --> 12:11.600
Maybe Asriel regrets what he did,
maybe it was a mistake.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.480
- It wasn't.
- How can you be so sure?

12:13.480 --> 12:18.279
Because Roger's dead body was in a cage.
In a cage that he made. He killed him.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.440
Look, he told me that the fate
of many worlds rest on me.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.799
That I have the only knife
that can destroy the Authority.

12:24.799 --> 12:26.679
As knife bearer,
it's my responsibility to do...

12:26.679 --> 12:29.840
To work alongside a murderer?
No.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.120
I've got something
more important for us to do.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.000
What's more important than that?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.639
When I was asleep, Roger spoke to me.

12:38.559 --> 12:40.679
He told me where he was
and he told me he needed help.

12:40.679 --> 12:43.600
- And I think we should go there.
- Go where?

12:44.399 --> 12:46.279
To the land of the dead.

12:46.279 --> 12:48.320
You can't bring people
back from the dead, Lyra.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.720
You don't know that. You've got a knife
that can cut through worlds.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.679
- So you think it's an actual world?
- It is. I've seen it.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.360
Listen, you can talk to your dad. You can
tell him the things you wanted to say.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.000
- No. This isn't some fairy-tale.
- So, you're choosing him?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.799
I'm not choosing your dad,
I'm choosing my own

13:02.799 --> 13:05.480
because he died
before I even knew him.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.279
I'm the bearer, not you.

13:09.799 --> 13:11.639
This isn't how I wanted things to be...

13:12.639 --> 13:14.919
I saved you. I did everything
I could to save you.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.000
You told me not to,
but I did it anyway.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.519
Maybe we're better off
not fixing the knife at all.

13:28.399 --> 13:29.840
The boy seems troubled.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.240
<i>Lyra is pushing him to do things
he doesn't want to do.</i>

13:32.240 --> 13:35.320
- She is her mother's daughter.
- You don't trust her.

13:35.320 --> 13:38.480
But she's also mine. Right, the knife.
Tell me about the knife.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.559
<i>When they step away,
I demand they leave it with me.</i>

13:40.559 --> 13:41.679
That's good.

13:41.679 --> 13:44.120
As soon as you know which world
you are in, send us your coordinates

13:44.120 --> 13:45.399
and we'll have someone come for you.

13:45.399 --> 13:46.600
Make sure to keep them
on a tight leash.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.879
Is it true?
You brought her here?

13:48.879 --> 13:51.399
Agent Salmakia, carry on,
stay in contact.

13:51.399 --> 13:52.639
What? You'd rather I let her go?

13:52.639 --> 13:54.919
I would rather you had
killed her on the spot.

13:54.919 --> 13:56.679
She is...

13:57.720 --> 13:59.120
devious.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.080
She has done much that's wrong.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.279
But look here.
She is fiercely intelligent.

14:03.279 --> 14:06.080
And it looks at the moment like she might
be on our side. I think we can use her.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.840
And you trust her so much,
you took her prisoner.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.200
I don't trust her one bit.
Which is why I want a second opinion.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.759
I'd like to put it before the council.
I think she might hold something back.

14:14.759 --> 14:18.039
My sister witches, tortured and killed
at Coulter's hands.

14:18.039 --> 14:22.639
I'm sure they are not the only ones.
There is no judgement to be made.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.919
Ruta, I am sorry for your loss.

14:25.679 --> 14:27.120
But I want her heard.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.000
Do you think you can agree to that?

14:38.679 --> 14:40.320
Where have you gone?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.320
Where have you gone?

14:51.279 --> 14:53.120
Don't doubt yourself.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.840
Then I shall do it without him.

15:34.279 --> 15:35.440
Lyra.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.720
Is it really that hard
to tell him "I'm sorry"?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.039
Why would I be sorry?

15:40.039 --> 15:43.480
He came for you, he found you,
he fought for you

15:43.480 --> 15:46.120
and the first thing you do
is argue with him.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.320
You're not always right, you know that?

15:54.399 --> 15:55.519
I'm sorry.

15:56.519 --> 15:59.120
One thing I know about you,
is that you don't apologize easily.

16:01.159 --> 16:03.200
Fine. Then I'm not sorry.

16:06.039 --> 16:07.360
I'm sorry, too.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.759
I don't wanna argue with you.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.559
Iorek's still close
to the window in my world...

16:28.639 --> 16:30.440
I checked with the alethiometer.

16:33.639 --> 16:36.519
We can fix the knife and then
you can decide what to do.

16:37.519 --> 16:39.759
- I'm not changing my mind.
- I'm not asking you to.

16:39.759 --> 16:43.240
The last thing my dad asked me to do
was take the knife to Asriel.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.919
I'm grateful you came to me first.

16:52.159 --> 16:53.320
I had to.

16:58.039 --> 16:59.919
I can't take you where you want to go.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.519
That's fine.

17:02.799 --> 17:05.079
Me and Pan will find
our own way to Roger.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.799
How will you get back?

17:11.519 --> 17:13.240
Just don't trust him.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.359
I did...

17:16.680 --> 17:18.000
I regretted it.

17:19.519 --> 17:20.599
I've heard enough!

17:20.599 --> 17:22.440
You've been lying this whole time.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.839
The knife is broken.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.880
Stop attacking him.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.359
Give me one reason why I should.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.200
Because Asriel needs him safe.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.519
It's him he wants, isn't it?

17:37.319 --> 17:40.920
Your father was right about you.
You are insufferable.

17:41.599 --> 17:42.920
Tell him we escaped.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.559
Tell him you lost the knife.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.799
And it's my mother
that broke it. Not Will.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.319
When he needs us most, we'll be there.

17:52.559 --> 17:53.720
Will we?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.599
You can fix it, can't you?

17:57.519 --> 17:59.480
Not with you here. We can't trust you.

18:00.319 --> 18:02.119
And if I refuse to leave?

18:02.559 --> 18:05.680
Then I'll close the only window
still open and we can all stay here.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.200
We can't be controlled by anyone,
especially Asriel.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.079
Then you leave me no choice.

18:16.279 --> 18:18.599
Whatever you're doing, do it quickly.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
This war will need us all.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.480
First thing tomorrow,
we go and find Iorek.

18:41.319 --> 18:42.680
Are those for me?

19:00.839 --> 19:03.519
You summoned me? My lord.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.000
Please sit.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.880
Why am I here?

19:19.640 --> 19:22.759
He wants us to see you and decide.

19:23.799 --> 19:25.000
Decide what?

19:25.640 --> 19:26.720
Who you are.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.640
Oh, this is a trial.

19:35.519 --> 19:37.799
And what happens if you find me guilty?

19:38.319 --> 19:41.440
Pelt me with rocks?
Tar and feather me?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.599
Isn't that what you do
to unruly women?

19:43.599 --> 19:47.000
Don't play the victim, Marisa.
Doesn't suit you.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.200
We're trying to decide if you have
a place in the Republic of Heaven.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.319
Should you sit here on this council or...

19:52.319 --> 19:54.960
Be forever locked in
that windowless cell?

19:58.359 --> 19:59.759
What do you want to know?

19:59.759 --> 20:02.720
We want to know
of what use you can be.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.200
What would you like to hear?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.480
That I was the first woman in my world

20:06.480 --> 20:09.680
to sit at a table
with high clerics and scholars.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.440
That my experimentation
with Dust

20:12.440 --> 20:15.200
is equal to that of Asriel's?

20:15.200 --> 20:19.160
Ask him. See if he would contradict
anything I've said.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.480
This is not my floor.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.599
How interesting
because it looks like it is.

20:25.839 --> 20:28.119
- You are an agent of the Magisterium...
- Former agent.

20:28.119 --> 20:31.400
During your time
at the Magisterium, you killed...

20:31.400 --> 20:33.200
I killed witches, yes.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.680
I murdered. I experimented on children.

20:38.519 --> 20:41.039
I have behaved abominably.
You cannot...

20:41.839 --> 20:45.720
exact a harsher judgement than
the judgement I've placed on myself.

20:46.880 --> 20:51.279
But... you are not asking
the important question.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.480
Which is?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.880
Why would I help you?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.559
- Because we have the keys to your cage.
- No.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.880
Because you are the only ones I can see

21:03.880 --> 21:05.960
who could help protect our child.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.200
I have been the worst mother
in the world.

21:11.319 --> 21:13.000
I didn't think of her for years.

21:14.559 --> 21:19.640
And if I did, it was only to regret
the embarrassment of her birth.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.440
- The humiliation...
- Ridiculous!

21:21.440 --> 21:25.799
I have never understood why a child born
of our love should be a humiliation.

21:25.799 --> 21:28.759
An illegitimate child
and a murdered husband.

21:30.119 --> 21:33.200
That is quite something
to carry on my back.

21:35.519 --> 21:38.240
And the Magisterium
started becoming interested

21:38.240 --> 21:40.640
in Dust and children and I...

21:43.880 --> 21:45.839
...I had concerns for her.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.160
When they wish to control us,
they use our children.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.279
I saved her from the Oblation Board.

21:53.319 --> 21:55.640
I saved her even when she was
under a knife...

21:55.640 --> 21:59.079
The Oblation Board was your operation.
The blade was your invention.

21:59.079 --> 22:02.599
How easily you criticize others
and don't see it in yourself,

22:02.599 --> 22:04.440
Lord Asriel Belacqua...

22:04.440 --> 22:07.839
I may be no father, but I never put her
at risk. I kept her from danger...

22:07.839 --> 22:10.799
- And now you need to do more.
- No.

22:10.799 --> 22:14.720
The Magisterium will kill her with pomp,
and ceremony, and prayers,

22:14.720 --> 22:17.079
and lamentations, but they will kill her.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.680
I couldn't save her...
but you can.

22:23.359 --> 22:25.000
Do that. Please.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.640
That is all I beg of you
and I will do anything.

22:30.039 --> 22:31.279
Why?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.119
Because I love her, Ruta.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.240
I think we've heard enough.

22:57.839 --> 23:01.119
- What if Iorek's not there?
- He wouldn't leave without me.

23:31.599 --> 23:34.480
- I should've come alone.
- No.

23:43.079 --> 23:44.480
We don't have to go inside.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.559
You okay?

24:03.680 --> 24:08.440
I know it wasn't real, but I woke up once
or twice and she was holding me.

24:11.359 --> 24:12.720
Never been held before.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.279
Let's go.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.799
All right, that's enough deliberation.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.680
If you have a doubt about her,
now is the time to express it.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.759
I do.

24:41.759 --> 24:43.519
But she's not the only one I doubt.

24:45.279 --> 24:47.640
See, she's clear on what she is.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.400
But what's less clear
is what she is to you.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.759
If that woman tempted you,
I'm not sure you would resist.

24:55.759 --> 24:57.160
Does she stay, Commander?

24:58.920 --> 25:00.759
Provided we keep an eye on her.

25:02.359 --> 25:04.440
- Roke?
- She stays.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.720
As long as she proves useful to us.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.200
- Ruta?
- I like Lyra.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.640
And she is important to the witches.
So, for her, I agree.

25:16.160 --> 25:20.480
But if she betrays us even for a second,

25:21.079 --> 25:22.599
let me be the one that kills her.

25:23.039 --> 25:24.359
You will have that honor.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.160
Bring her in.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.359
Marisa...

25:31.160 --> 25:32.880
you are to stay.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.200
You'll have the freedom of the camp,

25:34.200 --> 25:35.880
but if you try to leave,
you'll be killed.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.000
- Oh, how kind.
- It's not a kindness.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.960
My colleagues seem to think
you'll be useful.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.720
Let's hope for your sake
that proves to be the case.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.279
You can unchain her daemon.

25:47.039 --> 25:49.559
The agent Salmakia, one of Roke's spies,

25:49.559 --> 25:52.200
tells us that Lyra
is travelling with a boy,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.200
the bearer of some powerful knife.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.039
Have you come across him?

25:56.039 --> 25:58.039
- A knife?
- That's what I said.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.960
Can you tell me about it?

26:02.720 --> 26:05.440
Will... that's his name.

26:06.119 --> 26:09.039
I've had the pleasure
of meeting him twice now.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.319
- Thank you.
- He considers himself a bit of a hero.

26:12.319 --> 26:14.920
But I find him rather insipid.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.640
And I heard nothing of a knife.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.359
Iorek!

26:36.640 --> 26:40.680
- I have missed you, Lyra.
- I missed you, too.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.799
You stayed and waited to see
if you could help.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.759
- And you can.
- How?

26:49.559 --> 26:53.039
Will's knife broke.
I need it to go to the land of the dead.

26:53.039 --> 26:54.920
And you're the best blacksmith
in the world, so.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.920
The land of the dead
is no place for the living.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.319
And that knife
should never have been made.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.200
But it was made
and I'm meant to be its bearer.

27:03.200 --> 27:08.160
You may have good intentions, Will,
but that knife has intentions, too.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.759
The knife's mine. I understand it.

27:10.759 --> 27:15.680
If you did, you would not use it
to cut Lyra through to that place.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.000
- Iorek.
- Lyra...

27:23.079 --> 27:27.240
the knife will have broken
because Will's mind was divided.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.359
He doubted his path.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.480
You never doubted yourself?

27:32.039 --> 27:35.480
- Bears do not doubt.
- You're lying.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.839
When I met you, you were drunk

27:36.839 --> 27:39.279
because you couldn't cope
with the idea of failure.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.559
I didn't understand then, but I do now.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.200
Doubt comes when you care.
It's not bear or human.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.599
It's the worst people that don't doubt.
The people like my mother and my father.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.200
The ones like Will and like you...

27:58.200 --> 28:00.400
the good people, they doubt

28:00.400 --> 28:02.920
because they don't know
which is the right path.

28:05.079 --> 28:07.480
Read your instrument, Lyra.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.839
Ask it whether you should go
to the land of the dead.

28:29.119 --> 28:31.319
I've never known it so confused.

28:31.319 --> 28:33.160
It's talking about balance.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.759
But it's such a delicate kind of balance

28:36.759 --> 28:40.079
that the faintest thought or wish
could tilt it one way or the other.

28:40.079 --> 28:44.599
Then that is your answer.
The alethiometer thinks it unwise.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.319
Then it said, "yes."

28:49.559 --> 28:51.880
Still a Silvertongue.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.160
Fine, I will mend your knife.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.839
But I do not like your purpose.

29:59.759 --> 30:01.400
Dr. Cooper.

30:04.359 --> 30:05.799
Thank you for seeing me.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.319
What is it you wanted to discuss?

30:10.119 --> 30:11.720
You have a service to perform.

30:18.119 --> 30:22.039
I am fascinated, particularly by energy,

30:22.039 --> 30:25.039
particularly by
what Asriel managed to do.

30:25.039 --> 30:28.039
The source of that colossal
energy release at Svalbard.

30:28.039 --> 30:33.319
Which he accomplished, I believe,
inspired by your severing technology.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.480
Anything you can do to help me understand
what you did with those children

30:37.480 --> 30:39.359
would be much appreciated.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.519
Why would you wish to...

30:44.359 --> 30:49.279
What happened at the station
was a moral and religious disaster.

30:51.319 --> 30:54.000
You sacrificed what you shouldn't have

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
in the aid of nothing at all.

30:58.039 --> 30:59.519
But you did learn.

30:59.519 --> 31:02.160
Now, put that learning to a good use.

31:04.359 --> 31:07.599
One of our team observed that
in the process of daemon severance,

31:07.599 --> 31:09.519
there was a release of energy.

31:09.519 --> 31:10.720
How much energy?

31:10.720 --> 31:14.359
It was heretical, mostly,
the work of my colleague...

31:14.359 --> 31:16.720
Now, could the energy from this sacrifice

31:16.720 --> 31:20.279
be manipulated into some new...

31:21.759 --> 31:22.920
weapon?

31:28.759 --> 31:32.400
You have the best minds
in Geneva at your disposal.

31:33.880 --> 31:36.559
And, of course,
if there were any question...

31:37.839 --> 31:43.559
you and your team will be unable to leave
the premises until your task is complete.

31:43.559 --> 31:46.400
Asriel's explosion
burnt a hole in the sky.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.680
I don't think we should be
building anything...

31:50.319 --> 31:51.480
Dr. Cooper.

31:52.960 --> 31:56.160
I am fighting for a new Eden.

31:58.039 --> 31:59.359
Here...

32:00.440 --> 32:01.720
on Earth.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.240
That gives me a strength
which I didn't realize I had.

32:13.279 --> 32:14.640
That is my task.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.720
It was ordained for me.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.119
And you must earn
the forgiveness of the Authority.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.160
Otherwise...

32:29.000 --> 32:31.440
I shall rip what I need from you.

32:39.319 --> 32:40.880
Courage, Dr. Cooper.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.680
Impressive, isn't it?
The intention craft.

33:04.039 --> 33:08.480
Oh, yes... you always were easily
impressed by what he made.

33:09.079 --> 33:12.279
I don't think he'd want you to be looking
at them quite so forensically.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.039
He gave me my freedom, Ruta.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.279
I'm simply trying to understand
what he's done here.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.920
So, your daemon powers it and your
intentions control it. Am I right?

33:26.960 --> 33:29.279
The lab where these are held...

33:31.039 --> 33:32.680
where can I find it?

33:54.240 --> 33:58.240
Salmakia has finally communicated
again. The knife is broken.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.799
In its current state, entirely unusable.

34:02.119 --> 34:03.880
- How?
- It broke.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.559
When Lyra's mother tried
to take it from the boy.

34:09.159 --> 34:12.280
- Have your agent return immediately.
- She's on her way.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.920
And Mrs. Coulter,
she's already lying to you.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.480
Commander Roke is angry with you.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.719
Seems you did see the knife.

34:30.719 --> 34:33.559
And that it was you, in fact,
who broke it.

34:33.559 --> 34:35.280
Why didn't you tell me Marisa?

34:35.280 --> 34:37.760
Well, I didn't think
it would further my cause.

34:37.760 --> 34:42.559
I believed you. I thought that perhaps
you'd finally found honesty.

34:42.559 --> 34:45.320
Honesty is not a thing
to be found, Asriel.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.480
You're either honest or you're not.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.360
And... neither of us are.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.760
You understand, I need to put you back
in your cell now?

34:53.760 --> 34:56.800
- You don't need to do anything.
- I don't want to.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.320
But understand that I will.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.719
They worship you, don't they?

35:03.719 --> 35:07.599
Ogunwe, the witch, the insect.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.800
Will they bow, do you think, when you
finally put yourself on the throne?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.880
I am not putting myself on a throne,
woman, I am trying to defeat one.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.559
You know, it fascinates me. How
enamored you are with your own power

35:18.559 --> 35:22.199
that you've come to embody
the very thing you most despise.

35:23.199 --> 35:25.119
I've abandoned the search for Lyra.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.440
I've called my agent away from her.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.639
Since you destroyed the knife
I have no use for her.

35:30.639 --> 35:32.679
- No. You can't, Asriel...
- I can and I have.

35:32.679 --> 35:35.079
- The battle I'm engaged in is too great.
- If you say that one more time...

35:35.079 --> 35:38.400
She is not my fight.
She cannot be Eve.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.719
- Then use this opportunity to...
- I am battling...

35:41.719 --> 35:44.880
to liberate us from these
oppressive fairytales.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.920
And yet from all angles,
I am being told

35:46.920 --> 35:49.559
that my own daughter
is the original symbol of guilt.

35:49.559 --> 35:53.079
- I cannot believe that story.
- It is not all about your beliefs.

35:53.079 --> 35:56.840
- They believe it and they'll act on it.
- A throne? I don't sit in a throne.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.320
I sit in the earth, in the soil,
in the filth.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.199
I've given my entire life
to fighting a battle that must be won.

36:04.199 --> 36:06.920
I have sacrificed so much.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.199
What have you devoted
your life to, Marisa?

36:10.199 --> 36:12.760
Power, hmm? And how did you get it?

36:12.760 --> 36:15.920
By making yourself the pitiless agent
of the Magisterium.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.079
The inventor of hideous machines
capable of tearing children apart.

36:20.079 --> 36:23.000
But along comes some foulmouthed,
arrogant little brat

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
with dirt under her fingernails
and you can love her.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.920
You cluck and you settle your feathers
over her like a mother hen...

36:39.239 --> 36:44.760
Why can't you just
be who I want you to be?

36:47.039 --> 36:49.360
Take your hands off me.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.960
Marisa, I'm doing this because
the power of the Authority is a lie.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.800
He didn't create anything.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.400
Not you or I, not any of the worlds.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.840
Only thing he ever created
were institutions to instill fear

37:30.840 --> 37:32.639
and exert control.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.320
Did you know he doesn't
even rule in heaven anymore?

37:37.039 --> 37:41.000
The Kingdom is ruled
by a regent called Metatron.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.840
An angel, just another person, really...

37:46.400 --> 37:49.400
intent on carrying on
the good work of his master.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.440
That's why I fight.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.119
I don't believe you.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.400
It is a lie.

38:08.159 --> 38:11.880
Every hideous thing you've ever done,
in his name...

38:14.440 --> 38:16.159
and it was all a lie.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.920
Come with me...

38:28.360 --> 38:29.960
I can show you.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.360
And then you can watch me start a war.

38:50.719 --> 38:53.800
Will, place the knife in the fire.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.519
A divided mind broke it.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.039
Only a strong one will make it new.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.199
This will be your task...

39:06.320 --> 39:08.119
as much as mine.

39:11.199 --> 39:13.800
Hold it still in your mind.

39:17.519 --> 39:21.199
Consider the path
to making the knife whole.

39:23.239 --> 39:25.599
Focus on what is important.

39:29.639 --> 39:31.480
Look what you've become...

39:32.559 --> 39:33.639
without me.

39:37.239 --> 39:39.119
No. Leave him.

39:42.599 --> 39:44.159
Focus your thoughts.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.320
You're a warrior, Will.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.960
Do you understand?

39:54.679 --> 39:57.199
The Æsahaettr, it's chosen you.

39:59.719 --> 40:01.800
Was your mother so easily disposed of?

40:06.199 --> 40:10.360
Try again.
You must go deep inside yourself.

40:11.559 --> 40:13.239
Find what matters.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.320
Lyra, stand clear.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.639
Will.

41:21.119 --> 41:22.440
Will.

41:24.039 --> 41:25.639
Will, can you hear me?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.679
Will.

41:37.159 --> 41:39.760
I have done as you asked

41:39.760 --> 41:43.679
and now you must decide
the path you take.

41:52.639 --> 41:56.400
If you do not find a way out
of the land of the dead,

41:56.400 --> 41:58.400
we shall not meet again.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.679
But if you do,

42:01.679 --> 42:05.519
you will always be
a welcome visitor to Svalbard

42:05.519 --> 42:08.440
and the same is true of you, Will.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.559
You are worthy of each other.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.679
Goodbye, Lyra Silvertongue.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.599
I hope we do meet again, one day.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.840
Who is he?

42:41.400 --> 42:43.119
Come back, stand here.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.480
An angel...

42:58.360 --> 42:59.920
How?

42:59.920 --> 43:01.599
Fell out of the sky...

43:03.039 --> 43:04.559
and right into my lap.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.480
- Does he speak?
- He's decided not to.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.599
But I don't need him to speak anymore.

43:19.559 --> 43:20.960
He's Beautiful.

43:21.719 --> 43:24.360
Everyone is beautiful.

43:41.559 --> 43:43.119
How does it feel?

43:44.920 --> 43:46.239
Different.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.320
It did something to you, didn't it?

43:53.559 --> 43:56.039
When the knife was being forged,
I saw things.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.440
What did you see?

44:02.000 --> 44:03.400
I saw...

44:04.679 --> 44:05.800
I saw you.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.039
I saw you and...

44:10.400 --> 44:11.639
Balthamos?

44:14.039 --> 44:17.599
- I thought you were gone.
- I should have done better. I am sorry.

44:18.199 --> 44:20.159
But I have been watching over you.

44:20.159 --> 44:21.800
- Is he a...
- He's an angel.

44:26.599 --> 44:29.280
- I'm Lyra.
- I know.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.679
You nearly lost it, forever.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.800
And now, are you ready
to go to Lord Asriel?

44:44.960 --> 44:46.719
He is gathering his armies.

44:51.239 --> 44:52.199
No.

44:53.119 --> 44:56.559
I'm sorry, Balthamos.
I have to go to the land of the dead.

44:57.159 --> 44:59.239
There's someone there
who needs our help.

45:00.079 --> 45:01.360
Lyra's friend.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.519
This is the route you must take?

45:04.519 --> 45:06.000
Yes.

45:07.639 --> 45:09.119
Then follow the path.

45:13.559 --> 45:14.920
Come with us.

45:16.840 --> 45:20.159
The land of the dead
cannot be entered by angels.

45:21.599 --> 45:23.679
And my path is a different one.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.199
But I shan't be far away.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.239
You'll come with me?

45:53.159 --> 45:54.599
Yeah.

45:54.599 --> 45:56.800
I'm not just my dad's son, you know.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.760
My mum's always said, "If your friend
needs help, then you should give it."

46:05.599 --> 46:07.039
Thank you.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.559
The worlds are rippling
with angelic activity.

46:28.239 --> 46:30.639
Xaphania's rebels
are gathering in scores.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.559
Like the shifting tide
before a great ocean storm.

46:40.239 --> 46:45.000
You said you trusted Asriel completely...
is that the truth?

46:45.000 --> 46:47.840
I think it is a dangerous assumption
that Xaphania's followers

46:47.840 --> 46:50.599
will side with a human
against one of their own.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.159
You really think
they will turn against us,

46:55.159 --> 46:58.199
because he has one
of Metatron's angels prisoner?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.679
- I think that depends.
- On what?

47:03.000 --> 47:04.880
What Asriel does to him.

47:08.519 --> 47:12.199
You're no doubt aware
of the legend of Æsahaettr.

47:12.840 --> 47:17.519
The knife that can cut through worlds.
A knife that can cut through anything.

47:17.519 --> 47:20.840
And unfortunately,
that knife is now broken.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.360
It was forged by human hand, you know,

47:24.920 --> 47:28.920
some three hundred year ago,
using rudimentary technology...

47:29.880 --> 47:32.800
whilst the people of that world
were still getting around

47:32.800 --> 47:35.760
using horse... and cart.

47:37.039 --> 47:38.960
Quite extraordinary, really.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.679
The point I'm trying to make
is that, perhaps,

47:40.679 --> 47:42.679
I never needed a knife
in the first place.

47:43.719 --> 47:49.280
This woman once created a device
capable of cutting the soul.

47:49.280 --> 47:53.480
I use the same technology
to blast through worlds.

47:53.480 --> 47:57.960
Now, together, we are going
to cut you to pieces

47:57.960 --> 48:00.519
and then blast you
back to your master.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.599
Marisa, if you'd be so kind
as to close the door.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.320
I'd like to begin now.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.320
Can you feel it, Alarbus? The energy.

48:28.320 --> 48:31.719
Such creativity down here in the worlds,

48:31.719 --> 48:34.679
and your kind seek to extinguish it.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.760
I do not do this willingly.

48:36.760 --> 48:39.440
I do this because you forced my hand.

48:46.639 --> 48:49.800
- You are a sinner.
- I am the agent of change.

48:49.800 --> 48:53.400
I am the harbinger
of your kind's destruction.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.079
You will get your judgement.

48:55.079 --> 48:57.800
But you will not
be the one to deliver it.

48:57.800 --> 49:01.960
Instead, you will deliver
my message to Metatron.

49:09.079 --> 49:11.199
My message to Metatron is this...

49:12.119 --> 49:15.360
...I am here.

49:32.159 --> 49:33.519
Marisa.

49:53.719 --> 49:55.039
Marisa!

49:58.360 --> 49:59.280
Marisa!

50:00.119 --> 50:01.039
Marisa!

50:01.480 --> 50:03.679
Soldiers, prepare to fire.

50:03.679 --> 50:05.000
- Hold fire!
- What?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.480
Roke!

50:07.159 --> 50:09.199
Get yourself inside that craft,
go with her.

50:09.199 --> 50:10.360
Understood.

50:29.119 --> 50:30.559
Goodbye, Asriel.

50:46.199 --> 50:47.480
Guns down.

50:49.039 --> 50:50.880
What game are you playing?

50:50.880 --> 50:52.880
She wants to play mother, so let her.

50:54.159 --> 50:55.760
I hope they're ready for her.

50:57.400 --> 50:58.599
Soldiers!

50:59.079 --> 51:00.440
About-turn.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.920
March!

51:32.679 --> 51:34.440
What exactly am I looking for?

51:35.159 --> 51:36.480
It's endless

51:37.039 --> 51:40.000
and flat and you can feel
the death within it.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.440
Tell me this is the right thing to do.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.159
I hope it's the right thing to do.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.320
That'll have to do.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.159
You okay?

52:09.800 --> 52:12.079
It doesn't feel like
it should go through.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.599
This is the last world I can find.

52:24.599 --> 52:26.159
There's nothing beyond this.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.639
This is it.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.480
This is it.

53:07.480 --> 53:08.840
You found it.

53:10.519 --> 53:12.000
How can you be sure?

53:12.480 --> 53:14.239
I saw it in my dream.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.639
It must be this way.

53:43.039 --> 53:44.199
Wait.

53:44.960 --> 53:46.400
This doesn't feel safe.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.719
Lyra, wait.
