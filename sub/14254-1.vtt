00:01.760 --> 00:04.069
Last time on "Star Trek: Voyager".

00:04.240 --> 00:07.869
Two more of the mutations
have been discovered.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.759
Have their cortical nodes analysed.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.435
- This is only a dream.
- No, I brought you here.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.674
This is Unimatrix Zero.
You used to come here.

00:19.840 --> 00:25.358
Unimatrix Zero is real. So are the people
who go there. They need our help.

00:25.520 --> 00:32.232
If we can't terminate their link, then
we'll simply have to pay them a visit.

00:35.560 --> 00:42.352
They don't have the ability to take action
in the real world. We'll give them that.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.956
Stay away from things
that don't concern you.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.394
I can't do that.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.269
We were more than friends, weren't we?

00:52.360 --> 00:55.636
This is our target.
Keep a transporter lock on me.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.553
Once I release the virus
you can beam me back.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.153
In how many pieces?

01:03.080 --> 01:07.358
Captain, I expected something
more cunning from you.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.360 --> 01:18.032
Their lifesigns are destabilising.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.715
And now the conclusion.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.631
- Lieutenant.
- I'm all right.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.951
- You have a subvocal processor.
- I can live with it.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.315
- The captain?
- We were separated.

02:09.479 --> 02:14.031
I don't know where they took her.
We must proceed to the central plexus.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.188
- Time.
- 17 minutes.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.716
- We should have heard something.
- Doctor?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.713
Their higher brain functions are stable.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.714
Cube's new heading - 121, mark 6.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.233
Matching course and speed.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.759
Their propulsion system is regenerating.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.798
They'll soon be capable of transwarp.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.110
I want you inside Unimatrix Zero.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.034
When the virus is released,
your friends will be the first to know.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.997
Problem?

04:39.160 --> 04:40.593
No.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.796
But I wouldn't call them my friends.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.428
Acquaintances then.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.353
Set aside your issues with these people.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.876
Understood.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.958
Patrol the north-eastern perimeter.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.793
More drones were spotted there.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.038
Where's that virus?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.395
Captain Janeway is deploying it.

05:29.560 --> 05:34.076
The Borg have increased their attacks.
They're identifying us one by one.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.834
Your mate is not here.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.355
He's not my mate.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.318
- He must not be regenerating.
- Or he's dead.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.313
He should be here. No one's seen him.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.433
If he died in battle,
I'm sure it was honourable.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.636
Here. Help me.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.393
It's obvious your heart is in conflict.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.676
My heart is functioning perfectly.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.551
Some advice from a warrior
in the bedchamber and the battle field.

06:16.720 --> 06:21.794
You must treat your heart as the enemy
so you won't be distracted in battle.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.794
I'll keep that in mind.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.558
- Has the virus been deployed?
- I'm not sure.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.518
Do you remember anything?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.796
No. Nothing.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.034
The central plexus is through here.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.873
Those must be the shield emitters
Seven told us about.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.679
- We need to get through that hatch.
- I'll deactivate him.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.833
- Captain.
- What's left of her.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.992
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.994
I can't access the plexus
without shutting down the power grid.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.153
The primary access port
is isolated from the main power grid.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.278
- Where is it?
- 30 metres from here.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.516
Tuvok.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.671
Commander.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.476
- I can hear the collective.
- The neural suppressant is wearing off.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.393
I'll be all right.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.997
I heard him. The Vulcan.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.556
But he's gone.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.950
Why? Why can't I hear the others?

09:14.480 --> 09:16.835
Leave this one to me.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.991
- Comfortable?
- Release me.

09:25.160 --> 09:30.109
Easier said than done. I think
I designed this trap a little too well.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.752
- What are you doing out here?
- Looking for you.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.832
- Korok was concerned.
- That doesn't sound like Korok.

09:45.960 --> 09:51.239
- He said you were missing.
- I've been busy setting traps.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.709
Not the most sophisticated technology.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.190
Seems to work. Hold on.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.270
I should return to the camp.
Wait for word on the virus.

10:10.440 --> 10:14.956
I'll go with you...
in case you run into any more trouble.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.669
As you wish.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.957
I'm sure Korok will be glad to see me.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.712
Tuvok.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.348
Where are you, Tuvok?

10:47.520 --> 10:50.751
- Commander?
- Stardate 38774.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.198
Vulcanis Lunar Colony.
The time and place of my birth.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.114
Recalling such details
helps me remain focused.

10:59.280 --> 11:04.798
Captain, if I succumb to the collective,
I'll pose a security risk.

11:04.960 --> 11:10.318
- You must deactivate me.
- Without the Doctor, that could kill you.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.950
Stay focused. Stay Tuvok.
That's an order.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.276
Captain, I've bypassed
the access codes.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.154
Welcome to the central plexus.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.399
Tuvok.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.994
Where are you, Tuvok?

12:13.800 --> 12:17.509
- Busy?
- What's on your mind?

12:17.680 --> 12:22.470
The away team.
It's been two and a half hours.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.952
The Doctor's keeping an eye on them.
We'll give it a little more time.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.793
Not everything goes according to plan.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.638
It occurs to me that with you
in command and Tuvok off the ship,

12:36.800 --> 12:40.918
that makes me acting first officer,
technically speaking.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.073
- What's your point?
- It's my duty to give you an opinion.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.438
I think we should pull them out now
before it's too late.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.751
I appreciate your diligence.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.309
But I've made my decision. We wait.

12:57.520 --> 13:02.116
- How long? A day? A week?
- As long as the mission takes.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.717
- This mission isn't worth their lives.
- You've made your point.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.189
Apparently not.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.351
Lieutenant.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.833
A first officer could get in trouble
for talking that way.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.116
I've learned from the best.

13:24.920 --> 13:29.118
I appreciate your concerns, Tom.
But I need your support on this.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.070
Aye, sir.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.710
Download the virus.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.717
Tuvok.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.549
My daughter's name is Asil.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.429
She was born in the city of...T'Paal.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.957
We share your memories.
You're part of us now.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.270
Don't resist.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.634
Commander Tuvok's synaptic pathways
are destabilising.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.151
If I decide to move in closer,
I assume my first officer would concur.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.676
You assume correctly.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.678
We have to contact Voyager.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.877
You're Commander Tuvok,
tactical officer of the starship Voyager.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.634
I'm your captain. Step aside.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.155
She's irrelevant.

15:26.360 --> 15:30.148
Captain, you must deactivate me.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.800
My designation is Three of Twelve.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.951
Where are you, Tuvok?

15:44.120 --> 15:46.076
The central plexus.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.839
- Range 40,000 km.
- Harry?

15:57.000 --> 16:01.949
- Too much shielding. I can't get a lock.
- Stay on it. Closer.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.956
This way.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.150
Back so soon?

16:38.160 --> 16:41.675
Target their shield generators.
Stand by phasers.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.035
Commander?

16:44.200 --> 16:47.431
Shields to full. Brace for impact.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.955
Someone's accessing our controls.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.116
- Shields down!
- Evasive manoeuvres.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.034
- I've lost the away team.
- Hull breaches. Decks 5, 6, 7.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.718
- Reverse course.
- We can't just leave them.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.997
The Borg have our access codes.
Get us out of here.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.510
Thank you, Tuvok.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.195
I'm losing voices.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.111
Five in spatial grid 96.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.238
Twelve in grid 182.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.988
Hundreds now.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.116
Thousands.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.474
I can't hear you.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.995
Why can't I hear you?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.231
You've disconnected from the hive mind.
Explain.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.877
Comply.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.439
No!

18:18.240 --> 18:21.630
I'm not alone. You can't stop us all.

18:50.280 --> 18:55.035
I altered the transmission
to restore your original appearance.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.670
- I know how vain humans are.
- Why am I here?

18:58.840 --> 19:04.039
You've caused a great deal of suffering.
I wanted you to see for yourself.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.919
You are the cause of his death, Captain.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.878
You disconnected him
from the hive mind.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.477
- You didn't have to kill him.
- He was confused. Irrational.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.870
I had no choice.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.830
Many more will die unless you tell me
how to counteract the virus.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.788
Sorry, we didn't think
to develop an antidote.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.190
I'll assimilate Voyager then.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.638
Your Doctor created the pathogen.
He can find a cure.

19:32.800 --> 19:37.749
My first officer will delete the Doctor's
program if you go near Voyager.

19:37.920 --> 19:43.153
It won't be long before thousands
of drones begin to fight back.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.993
- They will fail.
- Maybe.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.676
Probably. But a lot of damage
will be done before they do.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.515
Yes. A lot of damage.

19:56.680 --> 20:00.355
Spatial grid 94. Cube 630.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.750
Complement - 64,000 drones.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.356
But I can no longer hear three of them.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.637
No doubt they've joined your resistance.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.958
Are they trying to sabotage the vessel
and liberate others?

20:16.120 --> 20:20.591
I don't know
because I can no longer hear them.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.272
Initiate self-destruct.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.671
An effective solution, don't you agree?

20:30.880 --> 20:33.838
Spatial grid 091. Sphere 878.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.552
Complement - 11,000 drones.
Only one is silent.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.917
But I have no choice.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.071
I must silence all of them.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.709
I know how this must upset you.

20:53.880 --> 21:00.433
As a Starfleet officer, you value all life.
Even drones.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.831
How many more
are you willing to sacrifice?

21:04.960 --> 21:09.431
Thousands? Millions?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.230
You can put an end to this.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.357
I want you to go on a diplomatic mission.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.718
It's one of your primary functions,
isn't it? Negotiations?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.393
Go on.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.836
Tell them to rejoin the collective
and I'll stop.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.230
They will never agree to that.

21:31.400 --> 21:35.632
They're individuals now.
They have a choice.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.471
What are you afraid of, Captain?
That they may cooperate?

21:42.640 --> 21:47.509
You've been waiting for a chance to
damage the Borg. You've found one.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.319
You're only using them.

21:50.480 --> 21:56.157
'lf you really wanted to negotiate,
you'd visit Unimatrix Zero.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.357
You've sent drones.
Surely you could go yourself.

22:00.640 --> 22:06.749
Or will a taste of individuality
make you realise it's worth fighting for?

22:10.240 --> 22:14.631
Comply, or you will be responsible
for many more deaths.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.593
You'll have to destroy
the entire collective to find them all.

22:36.240 --> 22:40.677
Several drones have retained
their memories of Unimatrix Zero.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.276
- The virus has been deployed.
- Good. We need help.

22:44.440 --> 22:48.911
- The away team is still on that cube.
- And we can't mount a rescue.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.959
Can you find out if they have
anyone else aboard this cube?

22:53.120 --> 22:56.590
If they do, tell them to hurry.
They're our only allies.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.514
I'd like to make adjustments
to your alcove before you return.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.994
When this crisis ends,
I'll find a more permanent solution,

23:08.160 --> 23:11.436
so you can spend more time
in Unimatrix Zero.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.594
You're in a unique position.
Not many of us get to lead a double life.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.469
When this crisis ends
I will sever my link to Unimatrix Zero.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.870
May I ask why?

23:23.960 --> 23:27.350
I'm having difficulties
with one of the people there.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.034
Mr Axum?

23:31.080 --> 23:34.390
Whenever you mention his name,
your pupils dilate.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.154
Blood flow increases to your face.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.869
Both are consistent
with an emotional response.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.431
Axum and l
apparently had a relationship.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.636
Oh, romantic?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.836
There go those pupils again.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.350
Your diagnosis is accurate.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.756
Well...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.116
...how ironic.

24:05.280 --> 24:10.195
All this time we've been trying
to develop that aspect of your humanity,

24:10.360 --> 24:12.590
and it's been there all along.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.718
- Not any more.
- My readings say otherwise.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.634
You're very particular
about who you spend time with.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.156
No doubt that's why you and l
have become friends.

24:28.400 --> 24:33.713
If you were involved with Axum once,
doesn't that suggest he's worthwhile?

24:35.880 --> 24:39.668
He does possess
commendable qualities.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.518
Coming from you, that's high praise.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.558
There's nothing wrong
with feeling ambivalent.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.269
After all,
you're in the middle of a civil war.

24:52.440 --> 24:58.231
But eventually, you may want to give
this romance a second chance.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.593
Who knows? You may even get
to meet him in person some day.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.035
I'll say this for your Mr Axum.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.236
He's a very lucky man.

25:26.640 --> 25:30.155
The collective has found
a new way to attack us.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.517
Eleven ships have self-destructed
in three hours.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.878
We need to coordinate a way to strike
at the heart of the collective.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.554
Our target should be the Unicomplex.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.678
If we can disrupt the queen's control,

25:43.840 --> 25:46.798
it'll give us a chance
to build up a fighting force.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.396
There is one more objective.
The Voyager away team.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.109
Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.431
- We can still rescue them.
- She's right.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.434
They risked their lives for us.
Now it's our turn.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.910
- There's no time.
- It's a matter of honour.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.111
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.395
I'll see if any of our people
are on a vessel near theirs.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.516
- Thank you.
- It's the least we can do.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.516
What's wrong?

26:32.680 --> 26:37.674
It turns out I'm on a scout ship
patrolling the border of fluidic space.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.593
On the other side of the galaxy.

26:46.680 --> 26:53.358
I was hoping we'd be able to meet
one day in the real world.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.919
Me too.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.192
There are things I can do where I am.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.756
I'll try to contact Species 8472,

27:06.920 --> 27:09.753
see if I can persuade them
to join the fight.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.879
Given their history with the Borg,
I'm sure they'll be eager.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.397
I guess this rules out Vorothon Gorge.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.516
Gorge?

27:25.880 --> 27:31.591
It was the top of our list of things to see
if we were ever freed from the collective.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.830
Don't you remember?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.753
We could add fluidic space to our list.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.833
We still have Unimatrix Zero.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.320
It was sufficient before.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.070
And now?

28:20.920 --> 28:23.514
- Where are you?
- Over here.

28:40.400 --> 28:45.190
Don't be frightened.
Stand up. Let me look at you.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.476
Comply.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.879
You're one of the machine people.
You're trying to hurt us.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.513
That's the last thing I want to do.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.796
I'm here to help you.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.593
All of you.

29:03.760 --> 29:08.959
- They said you wanted to assim...
- Assimilate you.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.908
Yes. But that's nothing to be afraid of.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.112
You like having friends, don't you?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.999
Assimilation turns us all into friends.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.914
It brings us so close together
we can hear each other's thoughts.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.991
Is that fun?

29:27.760 --> 29:31.878
Yes. It's fun.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.231
I was about your age
when I was assimilated.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.960
I was worried then, too.

29:42.880 --> 29:47.635
But when I began to hear the others,
to hear their thoughts,

29:47.800 --> 29:49.791
I wasn't afraid any more.

29:49.960 --> 29:54.397
- Don't you miss your parents?
- They're here. With me.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.956
Part of us.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.794
I can hear them right now.

30:03.760 --> 30:09.073
Would you like to be with your parents?
They miss you. They want to see you.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.198
- Can I talk to them?
- Soon.

30:13.640 --> 30:17.474
But first I'd like to see more of this.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.076
There's a place
where you can see the whole forest.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.710
Show me.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.989
It's pretty, isn't it?

30:45.160 --> 30:49.836
I took your advice, Captain.
I visited Unimatrix Zero.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.310
It's far more primitive than I expected.

30:53.480 --> 30:58.156
How could anyone prefer
a crude environment to Borg perfection?

30:58.320 --> 31:02.950
Spend a little more time there.
You might find out.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.680
I've seen enough. It's an illusion.

31:05.840 --> 31:10.516
The people who go there are real,
and they won't give it up easily.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.636
They'll fail.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.516
I thought you'd like to see
our latest accomplishment.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.910
Recognise it?

31:22.680 --> 31:26.275
- No.
- I think you do.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.637
It's your nanovirus,
with a few modifications.

31:29.800 --> 31:33.998
We've reprogrammed it
to target your mutated drones.

31:34.160 --> 31:38.551
Once it's released,
it will erode their autonomic functions.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.711
They will die within minutes.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.792
You have no way to deliver it.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.997
Those drones have been separated
from the hive mind.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.833
They aren't linked to the central plexus.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.549
No. But there's another way
I can reach them.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.639
I'm prepared to go back to
Unimatrix Zero and release it myself.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.755
But I'm willing to reconsider.
It all depends on you.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.875
Me?

32:06.040 --> 32:09.430
If they rejoin the collective,
I'll spare their lives.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.991
They listen to you.
Tell them it's time to come home.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.398
You were responsible for many deaths.

32:18.560 --> 32:22.997
Now you can save thousands.
Decide.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.955
Let's try this again. Ensign?

32:31.760 --> 32:35.469
The warp core is on-line.
Navigational array. Shields at 20%.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.518
We've got sensors. Short-range only.

32:38.680 --> 32:42.116
It's a start.
Try to get a fix on the away team.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.555
Now what?

32:45.720 --> 32:50.236
Someone's tapping into our holographic
systems. It's a Borg signal.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.675
- Doctor to the bridge.
- Go ahead.

32:52.840 --> 32:57.118
Someone's here to see you and Seven.
Come down here right away.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.475
Kathryn?

33:12.520 --> 33:16.274
The Borg have established this link
so I can propose a compromise.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.434
We're listening.

33:18.600 --> 33:23.549
They've developed a nanovirus that
can kill every Borg with the mutation.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.917
They're prepared to release it
inside Unimatrix Zero

33:27.080 --> 33:31.596
unless all the drones there return
to the collective for reassimilation.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.955
That's surrender.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.874
I won't be responsible
for any more deaths.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.669
At least they'll survive as drones.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.515
Tell them Unimatrix Zero
can no longer exist.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.640
That's an order.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.869
Have I made myself clear?

33:56.440 --> 33:58.158
Yes, Captain.

34:02.760 --> 34:07.038
- We did our best.
- It's not over yet, Doctor.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.431
Can you disrupt the interlink frequency
for Unimatrix Zero?

34:11.600 --> 34:16.355
- The captain gave us a direct order.
- Not the one you think. Seven?

34:17.320 --> 34:19.311
I believe I can. But why?

34:19.480 --> 34:23.632
Didn't you hear?
Unimatrix Zero can no longer exist.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.315
Chakotay to the bridge. Report.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.995
A transwarp conduit
just opened off our port bow.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.956
Lieutenant?

34:36.199 --> 34:40.795
- They're on an intercept course.
- Evasive manoeuvres. Battle stations.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.110
- They're hailing us.
- Open a channel.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.193
Starship Voyager. I am General Korok.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.793
This vessel is now under my command.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.030
We've come to join you in battle.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.118
Your crewmates are coming
to retrieve you.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.480
You were wise to comply.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.593
Chakotay to Seven.
We're almost in range.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.751
Stand by.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.560
I've isolated the frequency.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.393
Get Korok.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.635
Our emitters are fully charged.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.598
Do you have the interlink frequency?

35:29.760 --> 35:32.115
- We have it.
- Wait for my signal.

35:32.280 --> 35:36.398
We have to end our regeneration.
We can't be here when it happens.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.599
- Will there be anything left?
- We're being asked to make a sacrifice.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.836
But it's the only way.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.800
- We're in range.
- Full power to the shields.

35:47.960 --> 35:52.636
All weapons on-line.
Voyager to Korok. It's time.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.395
You must go.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.590
Bridge, it's working.
Unimatrix Zero is shutting down.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.830
Acknowledged.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.673
Voyager to Korok. Now.

36:32.120 --> 36:36.796
- What are they doing?
- You wanted to destroy Unimatrix Zero.

36:36.960 --> 36:40.077
We're just lending you a hand.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.915
- Get me the virus.
- There's no one left to infect.

36:44.080 --> 36:48.995
- Is this your compromise?
- I don't compromise with Borg.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.831
Match their shield modulations and fire.

37:42.840 --> 37:46.594
- I'm picking up the away team.
- lsolating their bio-signatures.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.514
- Get a lock.
- I can't penetrate their inner shields.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.233
Voyager to Korok. Status.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.119
Patience. They're trying
to remodulate their shield grid.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.396
I'm attempting to compensate.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.755
- You shouldn't be here.
- Neither should you.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.230
- I've wasted our time together.
- No, you didn't.

38:30.400 --> 38:34.996
- You gave us a chance to fall in love.
- We've lost our way to be together.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.355
No. I'll find you.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.829
- Axum...
- I'll find you.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.908
Shields in subgrid 42 are destabilising.
Target that section.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.709
Initiate self-destruct.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.874
- Their shields are down.
- Energise.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.032
Chief medical officer's log,
stardate 54014.4.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.113
It's been 48 hours since the away team
returned to Voyager.

39:48.280 --> 39:53.274
I've been able to extract
most of their Borg technology.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.954
The captain and B'Elanna
are on the mend.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.556
But Tuvok will need a little more time
to recover.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.993
General Korok has finished his repairs.

40:07.160 --> 40:10.072
He's been contacted
by another Borg vessel.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.232
It's also under the control
of former drones.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.313
The Doctor removed my spinal clamps
but I won't play hoverball for a while.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.393
If I ever imply it's been easy on you,
remind me of this.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.913
Noted.

40:28.280 --> 40:33.912
Unimatrix Zero may be gone,
but the resistance is alive and kicking.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.719
The collective may never be the same.

40:36.880 --> 40:41.192
Korok said he would try
to maintain contact, keep us informed.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.433
Have you heard from your friend?

40:45.600 --> 40:49.149
No. But I don't expect to.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.437
Axum's vessel is in the Beta Quadrant.

40:57.560 --> 41:02.395
If I ever imply that he was
nothing more than a friend...

41:03.880 --> 41:06.155
...remind me about today.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
