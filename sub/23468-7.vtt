16:28.455 --> 16:29.656
God!
I'm doing your list.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.026
Con --
I'm unnecessarily...

16:33.060 --> 16:34.427
combative.
-Yeah.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.129
Con -- I'd rather watch
"The Wire"

16:36.163 --> 16:38.198
than give you a blow job.
-"The Wire," I understand.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.133
But "House Hunters"?
Come on!

16:40.167 --> 16:45.272
And also, con -- I will
never, ever, ever, ever
marry you. Sorry.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.740
Why not?
Because I don't
believe in marriage.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.077
I thought I made that
pretty clear.
I thought you were just
playing it cool.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.212
No. God, no, I think
that whole, like,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.114
getting married in front
of God bullshit is
really -- it's psychotic.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.715
What's psychotic
about a commitment?

16:55.748 --> 16:56.516
Okay, it's just
a promise.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.518
I know, but I don't need
a wedding

16:58.551 --> 17:00.587
or a marriage
to make a promise.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.057
[ Sighs ]

17:04.091 --> 17:06.459
It's so funny we're talking
about this now.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.229
-Why?
-[ Scoffs ]

17:09.262 --> 17:12.765
'Cause the whole reason I
brought you down here was to...

17:12.799 --> 17:14.734
give you
this stupid thing.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.671
Oh, my God!
Dude, holy shit!

17:18.705 --> 17:21.274
That's -- That's huge.
-Yeah.

17:21.308 --> 17:24.277
That's a beautiful, beautiful
cushion cut you got there.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.580
That's great clarity.
Really amazing clarity.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.316
No inclusions, I mean, I
obviously don't have a loop,

17:29.349 --> 17:30.850
so I can't really
see it, but...

17:30.883 --> 17:33.086
Yeah, great fire.
Even in starlight.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.322
What did you do,
drop like, 30K on this?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.789
What? Yeah.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.626
That's exactly how much I spent.
How'd you know that?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.361
Were you
a former diamond smuggler?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.331
[ Cackles ]

17:44.364 --> 17:47.334
No. [ Chuckles ]
Stupid really.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.170
Yeah, that represents
my entire life savings.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.172
Sweetheart, you didn't
have to do this, Nate.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.207
You didn't.
-I know.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.509
I mean, I'm gonna --
I should hang onto it, as...

17:56.543 --> 17:58.178
-Yeah.
-...as a promise.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.880
I'm not saying "yes."

18:00.913 --> 18:01.714
[ Sighs ]

18:01.748 --> 18:03.683
But I'm definitely
not saying "no."

18:03.716 --> 18:06.153
I'm just --
I'm just saying --

18:06.186 --> 18:07.654
-Oh, Jesus! Hey! careful!
-Shit, shit, shit!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.322
-[ Whines ]
-My God!

18:09.356 --> 18:12.192
Just put it on your finger
so you don't lose it.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.826
It's so much money.
-Okay, sorry.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.864
Listen to me.
If you stay,
Yeah.

18:17.897 --> 18:22.202
I promise to reset every single
annoying fault that you have.
Well, within reason.

18:22.235 --> 18:27.407
I promise to be the most
attentive, loving father
to our beautiful babies.
You already are.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.877
-Okay, I will stop drinking.
-No! Moderation, you know.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
Okay. I'll stop
watching hockey.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.447
Just the minor leagues
and the classics on VHS.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.216
I'll shave
the douche doughnut.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.385
You know what would be sexy?
A beard.
Yeah.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.788
I'll promise to stop wasting
time inventing stupid shit

18:41.821 --> 18:43.323
that no one
will ever buy.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.392
The NateVan was actually
not that bad of an idea.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.794
No, you were right. You're never
gonna stop the rapes.
I know.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.397
Okay.
And listen to me.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.934
If you stay, I promise
to never, ever, ever, ever

18:54.967 --> 18:57.170
take your hand
in holy matrimony.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.373
[ Chuckles ] I do.
I mean, I don't.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.379
[ Retches, coughing ]

19:06.413 --> 19:07.547
Okay.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.385
Okay? You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

-What?! Oh!
-Holy!

19:30.737 --> 19:32.772
I told you it was
gonna come back to us!

I told ya!
-No, you didn't, but who cares?

-Oh, whoa.
-What?

Your foot felt
really smooth right there.

That wasn't my foot.

Get up. Get up,
get up, get up!

19:45.418 --> 19:48.255
He actually followed
through on his promise
to never marry me.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.257
-It's probably for the best.
-[ Sighs ]

19:50.290 --> 19:51.358
I mean, not marrying me
is one thing,

19:51.391 --> 19:54.327
but to make me stand up here
like an asshole is...

19:54.361 --> 19:56.563
a whole other thing.
This is so embarrassing.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.398
You're embarrassing me
in front of all of my voters.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.467
-What did I do to deserve this?
-A lot.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.435
Should we make a list?
-No! We made a promise.

be together forever.

Have some respect for
the loser bride and turn it off!

from his jacket.

I know we said
that we would never do this,

20:25.425 --> 20:27.760
but we've got guests
and we've got a cake
