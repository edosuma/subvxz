WEBVTT

00:53.263 --> 00:56.307
- Oh.
- Careful, Doc.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.524
- Easy.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.442
All right.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.033
- Christ, he's heavy.
- Yes, he is.

01:22.584 --> 01:25.878
Doesn't sound like
he wants to leave you, Doc.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.671
I'm sure you'll give it
a good home.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.924
Oh, yeah.
He'll have it real easy.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.384
He'll just lie around all day,
you know.

01:32.385 --> 01:36.722
He'll travel a little, get to meet
a lot of interesting people.

01:36.723 --> 01:39.851
I kind of envy 'em sometimes.
I really do.

01:44.564 --> 01:45.732
Shut up in there!

01:46.733 --> 01:48.484
You got to learn some manners,

01:48.485 --> 01:50.403
before you and me
are gonna get along.

01:51.905 --> 01:55.825
- That right, Doc?
- It'll settle down in time.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.716
What time is it?

02:12.717 --> 02:15.886
Well, it looks
like day is about to pop in.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.764
I'd say about 4:30.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.309
There you are, Doc.
That's 800 bucks.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.311
Thank you.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.273
- Aren't you gonna count that?
- I trust you.

02:28.191 --> 02:31.903
Boy. Ain't many people ever
said that to me before, Doc.

02:32.904 --> 02:35.448
You're a real gentleman,
you know that?

02:35.698 --> 02:37.283
And a genius, besides.

02:37.909 --> 02:42.121
Yes, sir. You're a real
and a bona fide genius.

02:42.122 --> 02:43.330
First one I ever met.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.251
It's rare to be appreciated
for one's failures.

02:46.543 --> 02:47.918
You mark my words, Doc.

02:47.919 --> 02:50.588
You're gonna go down in history
as a great man.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.342
You're great man, Doc.

02:57.262 --> 02:59.471
I'm gonna get this show
on the road.

02:59.472 --> 03:02.183
- See ya.
- Good-bye.

04:28.853 --> 04:33.650
Here we have two of the most
commonly confused snakes.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.735
Uh, that is, the snakes themselves
are not confused,

04:36.736 --> 04:38.738
But we have a tendency
to confuse them.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.323
Let me put that another way.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.575
The difference is,

04:43.576 --> 04:49.081
in the case of the poisonous coral,
the red and yellow bands touch.

04:49.082 --> 04:52.542
Whereas, in the case
of the non-poisonous king,

04:52.543 --> 04:57.047
the red and yellow bands
are separated by black stripes.

04:57.048 --> 05:01.385
Now, a good way to remember that
is the old folk saying:

05:01.386 --> 05:04.389
"Red touch yellow, kill a fellow."

05:09.018 --> 05:11.561
And they're off...

05:11.562 --> 05:15.233
Uh, with the exception
of Miss Stewart.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.580
Dr. Daniels,
I didn't want you to think...

05:30.581 --> 05:34.669
Oh, but thinking
comes naturally to me, Kitty.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.213
Just as, uh, apparently...

05:38.214 --> 05:41.175
Red touch yellow, kill a what?

05:41.467 --> 05:43.970
Kenneth Daniels, I'm confused.

05:45.013 --> 05:46.722
Miss Stewart, you'll have to excuse us,

05:46.723 --> 05:49.350
unless, of course, you have
a good stomach for bloodletting.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.271
Pretty girl.

05:53.688 --> 05:57.108
Still up to your old vices.
Shame on you.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.776
- Here.
- No, thank you.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.529
Oh, you might as well.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.450
Neither one of us
have very long to live, anyway.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.494
You might as well enjoy yourself.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.830
That's been your attitude
for 20 years.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.873
Ahhh.

06:12.874 --> 06:15.834
Now we'll hear about
the carefree grasshopper

06:15.835 --> 06:16.669
and the busy ant.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.712
No. Not my field.

06:18.713 --> 06:22.342
Oh, that's right. You're our
ophiological expert, aren't you?

06:22.508 --> 06:27.221
The esteemed Dr. Stoner
in his country laboratory...

06:27.388 --> 06:30.975
cackling over his bubbling bottles
and dripping serum.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.560
The theories I have originated

06:33.561 --> 06:37.106
are now being considered
by the world medical opinion.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.859
Considered inconclusive.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.820
Now, let's get to the point.

06:43.029 --> 06:44.905
Since I'm chairman of the department,

06:44.906 --> 06:47.824
you'd like me to recommend
an extension of your research grant

06:47.825 --> 06:48.909
for another year.

06:48.910 --> 06:50.203
- Isn't that it?
- Look, Ken.

06:50.370 --> 06:55.248
I am not some crackpot
who's come in begging, hat in hand.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.835
I've got 30 years
in the field of venom research.

06:58.044 --> 07:02.005
I've got 7 books, 63 articles,
and monographs.

07:02.006 --> 07:06.468
Please, don't haul out those
thumb-worn and yellowed credentials.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.844
Please.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.056
Oh, I feel sorry for you, Carl.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.766
A first-rate mind...

07:12.767 --> 07:15.186
gone to seed.

07:16.979 --> 07:21.818
Well... Well, I suppose I have been
a little bit out of it, lately.

07:22.026 --> 07:25.279
As you've said,
we haven't got that long to live.

07:25.738 --> 07:29.867
Of course, I need that grant.

07:30.868 --> 07:34.205
I was hoping you might
recommend some

07:34.622 --> 07:37.041
bright young student who'd be willing
to help me this summer.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.098
I thought you had someone
working for you.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.463
I did have, but he left me
on short notice.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.968
I'm not exactly sure I want to place
one of my students in your hands.

07:47.969 --> 07:51.221
Oh, come on, Ken.
You've ridden my ass enough today.

07:51.222 --> 07:55.476
I may be a little self-involved,
but I'm hardly Dr. Frankenstein.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.812
You are to me.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.482
You've been a thorn in my side
for 20 years.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.736
- I'm sorry, Ken.
- It's not Ken.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.573
It's Dr. Daniels, Dr. Stoner.

08:08.781 --> 08:10.450
We can't be friends.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.077
At least, we ought to treat each other
with proper accord.

08:14.328 --> 08:19.876
- Agreed.
- Say it... "Dr. Daniels."

08:21.085 --> 08:22.545
Dr. Daniels.

08:26.174 --> 08:28.217
Well...

08:28.551 --> 08:31.178
It's about time I had a little respect
from you, eh?

08:31.179 --> 08:33.347
You have it... and my gratitude,

08:33.514 --> 08:36.142
if you'll just recommend
somebody to help me.

08:36.642 --> 08:41.022
Well, I suppose I could find it
in the goodness of my heart.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.068
As a matter of fact,
I think I know just the boy.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.737
You got Kitty in trouble.
I don't like that.

08:48.738 --> 08:50.739
Oh, come on, Steve.
You know he didn't mean to.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.242
If anybody gets a chick in trouble,
it's old Steve-O.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.370
Are you going to apologize to her
or am I gonna have to make you do it?

08:56.621 --> 08:58.501
I don't think there's anything
to apologize for.

08:59.624 --> 09:02.752
- This says different.
- What's that, proof of Darwin's theory?

09:03.002 --> 09:06.963
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means natural selection.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.342
Survival of the fittest.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.801
- Are you David?
- Uh, yes.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.303
- David Blake?
- Yes.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.972
- I'm Dr. Stoner.
- The herpetologist?

09:15.973 --> 09:18.308
The herpetologist, yes.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.310
I'm into snakes.

09:20.311 --> 09:23.146
Uh, David. Excuse us.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.065
Lucky.

09:24.066 --> 09:25.066
I know the snake...

09:26.317 --> 09:29.778
I can't believe that Dr. Daniels
really recommended me for this job.

09:29.779 --> 09:31.739
Why do you say that?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.367
Well, he's just not my idea
of a real teacher.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.701
Every time I ask him a question,
he just says,

09:36.702 --> 09:38.870
"Why don't you work
on that little problem for yourself,

09:38.871 --> 09:40.872
and please spare me
the results of your efforts."

09:40.873 --> 09:43.542
That sounds like Daniels.

09:43.543 --> 09:47.754
In the future, let's try to respect
each other's questions,

09:47.755 --> 09:49.173
see what happens.

09:49.966 --> 09:55.596
Incidentally, I don't think
wisdom will die with Dr. Daniels.

09:58.558 --> 10:01.394
Oh. It's all right, Harry.

10:01.561 --> 10:05.690
This is Harry,
my obedient serpent.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.317
Hello, Harry.

10:08.943 --> 10:10.820
Wow. He's a real beauty, isn't he?

10:14.365 --> 10:16.867
<i>- Red-tailed boa?
- Yes.</i>

10:19.412 --> 10:21.455
Wow. He's hot.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.457
Hey, you're thirsty, aren't you, boy?

10:24.458 --> 10:28.921
Oh. I've got a little something
here for Harry.

10:30.715 --> 10:33.050
Here you go, boy.

10:36.387 --> 10:39.764
Can't deny an old man
his nip now and then.

10:39.765 --> 10:43.894
After all, in human terms,
Harry's almost 63.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.914
I'll just get some water for Harry.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.380
Hey. What gives, kid?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.800
Ah, just helpin' you out.

11:15.051 --> 11:17.428
Helping yourself, you mean?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.602
Now, I am sorry about that,

11:25.227 --> 11:29.065
but maybe that'll teach you
to ask before you touch.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.297
Holy shit! Help!

11:54.298 --> 11:57.258
- It's all right. Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Get it off!

11:57.259 --> 12:00.262
- Just get it off!
- Relax your arm, please.

12:00.471 --> 12:02.889
- Well, just get it off of me.
- I will.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.350
David, could you
give me a hand, please?

12:05.351 --> 12:07.018
It's his tail that's caught so tight.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.522
Let go, Harry. Let go.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.231
What's the matter
with you people, anyway?

12:11.232 --> 12:13.651
You crazy or somethin'? Carryin'
a snake around like that in a car!

12:13.859 --> 12:17.071
Sorry, but that'll teach you
to ask before you touch.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.139
David, we're home.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.308
Hi, Dad.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.644
I wasn't expecting you back
until tomorrow.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.522
Oh, a friend of mine gave me a ride,
so I decided to save time and money.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.400
You know, you would be amazed
at how much work babies are,

12:55.401 --> 12:56.610
even your sister's.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.403
I missed you.

12:58.404 --> 12:59.822
Grandpa!

13:00.114 --> 13:01.991
Oh. Hello, Jeffrey.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.451
Oh, excuse me.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.411
Uh, this is my daughter...
Kristina.

13:06.412 --> 13:08.913
- Kristina, this is David Blake.
- Hi.

13:08.914 --> 13:12.333
- Hi.
- David's going to be my new assistant.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.336
- Where's Tim?
- Tim left.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.338
He left? Just like that?

13:17.339 --> 13:20.926
Illness in the family.
His father was seriously ill.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.512
He's a handsome fellow.

13:23.763 --> 13:26.182
You know, I thought he told me
his father was dead.

13:26.432 --> 13:30.811
His fath... You're right.
It was Tim's uncle.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.397
It's a shame.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.524
The fear that most people
have of snakes

13:36.525 --> 13:39.110
is based on the same
misunderstanding

13:39.111 --> 13:42.072
that they have
about any other minority group.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.575
If they're told
that one member is harmful,

13:45.576 --> 13:48.244
then they generalize and believe
that they're all dangerous.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.246
It's so stupid.

13:50.247 --> 13:55.543
For example, uh,
the hognose is completely harmless.

13:55.544 --> 13:59.130
So much so that he can't
even be induced to bite.

13:59.131 --> 14:02.551
Watch me. Watch my finger.
See him get away?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.596
See? See him run away
from my finger?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.139
Put your finger in there.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.601
Go ahead.
Right up to his nose.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.561
He's a consummate coward.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.026
That's enough.
Let's leave him alone.

14:24.198 --> 14:28.284
Uh, this is Sam.
It's Kristina's turtle.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.289
He's... albino from Malaysia.
He's a little peculiar.

14:32.665 --> 14:37.752
You've, uh, probably noticed, David,
all the tags in this laboratory.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.504
The color of the tag indicates

14:39.505 --> 14:41.923
the comparative degree
of danger of the species.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.677
Now, a green tag
means non-poisonous.

14:46.262 --> 14:50.099
A yellow tag means poisonous.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.854
But, uh, serum for all of these snakes
along the wall here is easily obtained.

14:55.062 --> 15:01.861
Now, a red tag
means highly venomous.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.697
Uh, serum is available
for these species,

15:04.864 --> 15:08.075
but in most cases,
it arrives too late for help.

15:08.701 --> 15:11.244
The, uh, black mamba, for example...

15:11.245 --> 15:13.538
That's him in the cup.

15:13.539 --> 15:17.667
Secretes enough poison
in a single bite to kill 10 men.

15:17.668 --> 15:20.503
- Oh? Where does he come from?
- Africa.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.715
This one was from the Congo.

15:22.882 --> 15:27.469
I see by the chart he's hungry,
or at least he ought to be. Uh...

15:29.680 --> 15:32.683
- Would you, uh, stand back, please?
- Oh.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.564
He may appear to be
a little shy at first.

15:43.903 --> 15:44.903
But...

15:46.572 --> 15:48.698
he's the fastest snake
in the world.

15:48.699 --> 15:52.286
But I have him... near the head, too,
where I need him.

15:54.413 --> 15:57.750
His, uh, venom is neurotoxic,

15:58.667 --> 16:00.251
inhibiting the breathing

16:00.252 --> 16:04.882
and affecting the vagus nerve
that controls the heartbeat.

16:05.090 --> 16:09.427
The victim's heart beats wildly, and
he usually succumbs within an hour

16:09.428 --> 16:12.181
to symptoms that appear very much
like a heart attack.

16:12.348 --> 16:15.059
Would you hand me
that feeding gun, please?

16:15.851 --> 16:20.688
You know, uh, most snakes
will not eat in captivity.

16:20.689 --> 16:25.109
This, uh, force-feeder
contains a premeasured diet

16:25.110 --> 16:29.697
of, uh, milk, eggs,
vitamin concentrates,

16:29.698 --> 16:33.576
liver, gelatin, bone meal
and chicken blood.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.579
- Chicken blood?
- For flavor.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.792
Give it a little squeeze, please.
Gently.

16:40.626 --> 16:45.755
That's it. Now, we don't want
to give him indigestion. That's enough.

16:45.756 --> 16:53.222
David, together, we've just fed
a very hungry black mamba.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.184
Excuse me.

16:57.893 --> 17:02.773
This room here
is where we store venom...

17:03.816 --> 17:06.694
and dry-freeze it into crystals...

17:08.028 --> 17:10.531
just like coffee.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.532
Then it's blended and ground

17:13.534 --> 17:18.414
and, uh, shipped to pharmaceutical
firms and research laboratories...

17:19.415 --> 17:25.169
where it's used as, uh, coagulants
and, uh, pain relievers...

17:25.170 --> 17:28.214
and the treatment
of certain blood diseases.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.716
Bookkeeping.

17:29.717 --> 17:34.346
When I have the time, all of this,
which I detest so much...

17:36.056 --> 17:37.975
You do all this by yourself?

17:38.183 --> 17:41.477
No. Kristina helps me with the feeding
and the paper work.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.396
And, of course,
she runs the show on Sunday.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.717
It's basically a family business.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.818
Well, Dr. Stoner,
if there's anything I can do to help...

17:48.527 --> 17:50.612
I just hope you're not afraid
of needles.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.912
Immunization is an occupational
necessity in our house.

18:00.706 --> 18:04.084
That hurts more
than the bite of most snakes.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.336
What is it, some kind of antibiotic?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.797
Not precisely.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.800
You can put your finger on that
for a few minutes.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.263
- It sure does sting.
- That'll only last a few minutes.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.391
And you won't even feel that
during the booster shots.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.310
Booster shots?

18:22.311 --> 18:24.563
Every few days
for the next month or so,

18:25.105 --> 18:28.399
until you can sustain
a full drop of raw venom.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.111
Oh. Wait a minute.
What are you trying to do, kill me?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.279
On the contrary.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.366
I'm trying to make sure
that nothing else does.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.463
Come here, David.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.563
The king cobra...

19:07.564 --> 19:10.901
the most dangerous
of all living creatures.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.446
It's six years,
and he still doesn't like me.

19:15.447 --> 19:19.033
Why should he?
I'm just a common human and...

19:19.034 --> 19:21.285
he's the king.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.496
The most cunning, the most vicious,

19:23.497 --> 19:26.375
the most insolent
of all God's creatures.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.838
It's only Friday, Your Majesty.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.841
Two more days
you'll get your chance again.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.678
He's not afraid of anything, is he?

19:38.595 --> 19:39.888
Nothing human.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.227
Do you recognize
the common mongoose?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.855
Harmless, furry little animal...

19:48.856 --> 19:50.649
except when he faces a cobra.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.545
Are you religious, David?

20:12.546 --> 20:15.299
Well, I've... I've never
really given it much thought.

20:15.549 --> 20:18.384
I've given it a great deal of thought.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.052
You've read, of course,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.513
that the serpent who tempted Eve was
actually...

20:22.514 --> 20:26.059
Oh, come on, Dad! David doesn't want
to hear about all that right now.

20:26.310 --> 20:31.439
Kristina, I'm not going to bore him
with the whole Book of Genesis.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.900
The serpent who tempted Eve
in the garden

20:33.901 --> 20:36.986
was actually Lucifer, the Devil,

20:36.987 --> 20:40.073
cast down on Earth in another form
to do the Lord God's work.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.244
Dr. Stoner, do you really think
it was God's work?

20:44.494 --> 20:46.094
To tempt man
with the fruit of knowledge?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.249
What else would you call it?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.459
Granted, we have
misused that knowledge

20:51.460 --> 20:54.963
and brought man
to the brink of extinction.

20:55.797 --> 20:59.592
Well, I don't think man
will ever become extinct.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.595
I think he has the will
and the knowledge

21:02.596 --> 21:04.473
to find some way to survive.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.683
Do you really? So do I.

21:07.684 --> 21:11.395
To evolve, in order to survive.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.981
And I think we can help him.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.402
I don't know if I'll be much help
to man tonight.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.072
Well, forget man.
What about woman?

21:20.239 --> 21:21.823
Who's gonna help me
wash the dishes?

21:22.324 --> 21:24.493
I will.

21:25.619 --> 21:26.619
Oh.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.916
I feel so... sleepy. I...

21:31.833 --> 21:35.044
It's the effect of the inoculation.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.880
You'll sleep very soundly tonight,
David...

21:37.881 --> 21:40.092
and, perhaps, even through tomorrow.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.134
And if you're lucky,

21:42.135 --> 21:46.014
you may experience what few persons
have ever known and lived to recall.

21:46.265 --> 21:49.268
You see, the venom of the cobra

21:49.518 --> 21:52.396
is one of nature's
strongest hallucinogens.

21:56.942 --> 22:00.112
Kristina. Kristina.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.490
We'd better help this boy to his room.

24:34.933 --> 24:39.271
You're asking me questions, Harry,
and I hear you.

24:39.938 --> 24:45.318
But a scientist cannot afford
the indulgence of guilt.

24:45.777 --> 24:50.115
And after all,
if God doesn't want me to continue,

24:50.824 --> 24:54.035
the means of my disposal...

24:54.369 --> 24:58.081
always at his command.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.547
- A little more?
- Come on.

25:06.548 --> 25:09.717
You're gonna turn him
into an alcoholic.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.093
Here, drink the juice.

25:11.094 --> 25:15.182
- Thank you.
- Harry, don't listen to him.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.730
He's past it, isn't he?

25:22.481 --> 25:24.107
He's going to be fine.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.360
Please, uh, don't crowd up
to the enclosure.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.738
There's plenty of room
for everyone to see.

25:30.739 --> 25:34.200
You can sit on your cars,
or you can sit on your neighbor's cars,

25:34.201 --> 25:37.662
but please do not crowd up
to the enclosure.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.206
Back off.
Would you back off.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.875
Just about around in here is fine.

25:42.876 --> 25:46.004
Chiildren, back off over in there.

25:46.213 --> 25:49.089
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to witness

25:49.090 --> 25:51.384
one of the most dangerous
demonstrations

25:51.551 --> 25:54.136
in the history of modern science.

25:54.137 --> 25:58.891
Dr. Carl Stoner, my father,
will capture and extract venom

25:58.892 --> 26:01.353
from one of the deadliest
creatures on Earth...

26:01.520 --> 26:03.271
the king cobra.

26:03.522 --> 26:07.608
Although many snake venoms are
considered more toxic or poisonous,

26:07.609 --> 26:13.030
the king cobra has enough venom
in a single bite to kill 30 men.

26:13.031 --> 26:16.325
And unlike most snakes
that attack and then retreat,

26:16.326 --> 26:20.539
the king cobra is apt to chew
into his victim several times.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.706
However, being of royal heritage,

26:22.707 --> 26:25.000
the king will never attack
unless annoyed.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.837
Unfortunately, almost everything
annoys the king.

26:28.547 --> 26:29.839
Sounds like my wife.

26:34.427 --> 26:38.306
Complete silence, please,
and no pictures until I give the signal.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.892
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:41.184 --> 26:43.395
one of the world's greatest
scientists...

26:43.562 --> 26:47.106
and... and experts
in the field of herpetology,

26:47.107 --> 26:49.651
Dr. Carl Stoner.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.909
Now, if you would please form a circle
around the enclosure,

26:58.910 --> 27:01.870
but please stand back
about two or three feet.

27:01.871 --> 27:05.500
And remember what I said
about not taking any pictures.

27:17.178 --> 27:21.182
Ladies and gentlemen,
the king cobra!

28:51.856 --> 28:52.982
I wouldn't touch it.

29:13.545 --> 29:14.545
Watch out!

30:20.570 --> 30:25.116
Dr. Stoner is now extracting the venom
from the king cobra.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.035
In the extraction process,

30:28.036 --> 30:31.246
the snake secretes its venom
voluntarily.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.832
And by this method,
a snake can be kept healthy

30:33.833 --> 30:36.002
and producing venom for many years.

30:43.968 --> 30:48.555
Now I'm helping Dr. Stoner
feed the snake using a pressure gun,

30:48.556 --> 30:52.227
which delivers a completely balanced
combination of nutrients.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.898
For those of you who are now leaving,

30:57.899 --> 31:01.401
may I remind you that contributions
will help Dr. Stoner

31:01.402 --> 31:03.195
continue his research.

31:03.196 --> 31:05.073
We really appreciate your support.

31:25.051 --> 31:28.220
Only $18.15.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.389
It's better than last week.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.142
$18 to risk your life?

31:33.643 --> 31:35.102
What's the matter with those people?

31:35.103 --> 31:37.522
Don't they realize the importance
of what he's doing?

31:37.772 --> 31:38.982
They come for the show.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.693
Some of them
come hoping he'll get bitten.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.736
Has he ever been bitten?

31:44.737 --> 31:47.156
More times than I care to remember.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.617
I'm glad the immunization
really works.

31:50.034 --> 31:54.289
With the smaller snakes, yeah,
but nobody knows about the king.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.131
Damn!

32:06.509 --> 32:08.887
Now, I've got you.

32:09.888 --> 32:12.056
He got me, Harry.

32:13.224 --> 32:16.102
I'll milk you tomorrow.

32:17.812 --> 32:19.480
You African bastard!

32:23.151 --> 32:28.239
I've got enough serum in me
for 10 mamba bites.

32:30.617 --> 32:34.954
We're both getting
older and slower, Harry.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.541
I think that's a sign that...

32:39.000 --> 32:42.378
I should stop dueling with the king.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.507
Too many important things
to think about.

32:47.216 --> 32:52.639
You know, I saw
an intriguing article yesterday.

32:53.932 --> 32:56.726
At our present rate of consumption,

32:57.310 --> 33:03.316
we can expect worldwide fuel
shortages in less than 50 years.

33:04.692 --> 33:08.780
The world is gonna belong
to the cold-blooded species.

33:10.865 --> 33:13.785
But we already knew that,
didn't we, Har?

34:17.181 --> 34:22.437
It's a perfectly natural reaction
to the cobra inoculation.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.397
I just wish you'd told me
about it before.

34:25.398 --> 34:27.399
I feel like an orange.

34:27.400 --> 34:33.405
Yes. You see, the venom burns off
the superficial layers of the skin...

34:33.406 --> 34:36.867
much like a sunburn,
only from the inside.

34:36.868 --> 34:39.119
It's the same principle
that allows a cobra

34:39.120 --> 34:40.911
to shed his skin every few months.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.541
Don't tell me this is gonna happen
every few months...

34:43.708 --> 34:45.868
'cause, if it is, you should've
got a fatter assistant.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.213
This is the first and last time.

34:50.715 --> 34:54.384
I feel positively naked... and cold.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.303
- Good.
- What?

34:56.304 --> 34:59.766
You'd best put on a sweater.
I feel a little chilly in here, myself.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.531
Doc Stoner.
I don't know if you remember me.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.868
I'm Dale Hardison.
I'm an old student of yours.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.953
Yes. I think I do recall.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.538
Well, there's no reason
why you should.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.706
I never was too good a student.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.584
But, uh, well, I'm the one that never
could remember the name

35:27.585 --> 35:29.169
of those plants' phylums.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.255
"Phyla"... still the plural.

35:32.965 --> 35:36.259
But, uh, you seem to have
found a worthwhile calling

35:36.260 --> 35:37.470
preserving the status quo.

35:38.096 --> 35:40.514
Well, yeah, it, uh, takes all kinds.

35:40.515 --> 35:42.683
- This is my deputy, Morgan Bock.
- How do you do?

35:43.518 --> 35:45.728
But not spelled the same
as the composer.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.983
What, uh, what can I do
for you, gentlemen?

35:51.692 --> 35:54.237
Well, you could get us
a couple of girls.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.281
We were kinda hopin', Doc,

35:58.282 --> 36:00.659
that you could give us
the 25-cent tour of your place.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.370
We've heard a lot about it
up in town.

36:03.704 --> 36:06.873
Be a pleasure. This way.

36:06.874 --> 36:08.793
Come ahead, Mr. Bock.

36:16.134 --> 36:18.928
This is the laboratory.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.264
And this...

36:22.223 --> 36:24.391
is my daughter, Kristina.

36:24.392 --> 36:25.685
Ma'am.

36:26.644 --> 36:28.855
And a female python.
A couple of girls.

36:30.273 --> 36:32.859
Don't tell me my old parking tickets
have caught up on me.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.695
Well, if they have, looks like you've got
a pretty good lawyer to defend you.

36:35.903 --> 36:39.115
No. No, she's sick.
Poor thing, she won't eat.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.243
That's three and a half weeks.

36:42.743 --> 36:46.706
I think we should isolate her,
so she doesn't infect the others.

36:48.249 --> 36:51.586
Gentlemen, she's heavy.
Could you give me a hand?

36:52.503 --> 36:54.880
Geez, Doc. Is it...? Is it safe?

36:54.881 --> 36:57.799
Pythons rarely attack
except when they're hungry

36:57.800 --> 36:59.468
or if they sense great fear.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.014
- All right.
- Hey, Dale.

37:03.264 --> 37:06.641
- Come on, Morg.
- It's okay. Just go right behind me.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.518
I've got its head.
It's all right.

37:08.519 --> 37:09.644
Whoa!

37:09.645 --> 37:11.479
It's okay. I've got its head.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.481
<i>- About four feet behind her.
- Yeah, right behind me.</i>

37:13.482 --> 37:15.525
- Oh, right about there.
- It's okay. Just grab on right there.

37:15.526 --> 37:16.402
Yes.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.029
- Right here?
- That's a good spot.

37:18.196 --> 37:19.362
Let's lift.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.530
One, two, three, up.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.116
<i>- Come on, Morgan.
- Whoa.</i>

37:23.117 --> 37:26.536
- Okay? Got it?
- On the way to the storm cellar.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.538
That's the isolation spot.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.082
Oh?

37:35.254 --> 37:36.839
Easy. Easy.

37:40.218 --> 37:43.553
I appreciate this so much.
Are you doing all right there?

37:43.554 --> 37:44.889
Doing okay, I guess.

37:45.848 --> 37:48.016
Sure is a big snake.

37:48.017 --> 37:49.977
I know.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.900
Gently. Thank you.

38:09.872 --> 38:13.292
Dad, I left some cages open.
I better go lock them up.

38:13.584 --> 38:16.003
Thank you, Kristina.

38:17.171 --> 38:20.591
Damn it.
That virus is hanging on.

38:21.133 --> 38:24.386
You and, uh, your daughter
live here alone, Doc?

38:24.387 --> 38:28.391
Yes. And my assistant, David Blake.
Possibly you saw him as you drove up.

38:28.599 --> 38:32.436
Hmm. You've got another boy
working here for you, don't you?

38:32.687 --> 38:35.564
- Tim McGraw?
- He left some time ago.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.817
Hmm. Went back to school, huh?

38:38.025 --> 38:39.944
No. I think a relative was ill.

38:41.195 --> 38:44.197
That, uh... That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, Doc.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.574
Uh, I got a letter from his aunt.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.735
She hasn't heard from him
for a couple of months and...

38:48.828 --> 38:49.829
she's kinda worried.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.569
I went over to the school
to check out the records and...

38:52.748 --> 38:55.548
nobody over there seen or heard from
him since he came to work for you.

38:55.710 --> 38:58.671
These kids today
just pick up and take off.

38:59.046 --> 39:00.256
Some of them do.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.053
You, uh...

39:07.054 --> 39:10.099
You just gonna leave that snake
runnin' around down here, loose?

39:11.392 --> 39:14.186
The cellar door is secure enough.

39:14.353 --> 39:17.106
And she'll probably nest
up there in the roofs.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.861
Well, Morg,
I guess we better be goin'.

39:22.028 --> 39:23.612
Uh-huh.

39:24.113 --> 39:27.033
- Thank you, Doc.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

40:07.490 --> 40:09.908
- What do you call him?
- His name's Aaron.

40:09.909 --> 40:12.828
- And what do you call him?
- Aaron the II.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.915
It's not infrequent
that they're born with two heads,

40:16.916 --> 40:20.461
it's just that only about one
in a million survive.

40:20.961 --> 40:21.961
Huh.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.839
So that's what a baby cobra
looks like.

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Mm-hmm.

40:27.009 --> 40:29.762
Careful. Careful.
They already have fangs and venom.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.723
You know, they're the only creatures
that can protect themselves

40:33.724 --> 40:35.434
from the moment of birth.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.270
Father says it's because
they're God's favorites.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.855
See? Look.

41:14.932 --> 41:17.309
<i>- Bye-bye, Dad!
- Bye!</i>

41:21.564 --> 41:25.942
- $11.20.
- I'd like to insure it too, for $3,000.

41:25.943 --> 41:27.902
You people sure got the racket.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.822
All you do is give them snakes
a little squeeze and...

41:30.823 --> 41:33.576
the money comes pouring out.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.328
You know, if we could just
get an urutu,

41:36.495 --> 41:39.331
we could actually start
to make real profits.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.043
The urutu is one of the rarest snakes
in the world...

41:43.377 --> 41:46.422
and is found only
in the jungles of the Amazon.

41:50.134 --> 41:53.846
- Hey. Where does that go?
- Oh, it goes around the lake.

41:58.767 --> 42:02.228
You know that one drop
of urutu venom...

42:02.229 --> 42:03.647
What are you doing?

42:40.935 --> 42:43.521
Uh, hey, uh,
let's go for a swim.

42:44.104 --> 42:47.233
Don't be silly.
We didn't bring our suits.

42:47.525 --> 42:50.069
It doesn't bother me
if it doesn't bother you.

42:51.111 --> 42:53.404
Come on.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.406
Come on, Kris.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.117
Look, you're a naturalist, right?

42:59.703 --> 43:02.206
Well, what could be more natural
than the two of us...

43:02.623 --> 43:04.250
going for a swim in the lake?

43:07.461 --> 43:08.546
Come on.

44:06.770 --> 44:08.896
Ready?

44:08.897 --> 44:11.190
I'll go first.

44:11.191 --> 44:13.193
You're comin'?

44:27.791 --> 44:29.585
Hurry up!

44:30.336 --> 44:32.170
Don't look!

44:32.171 --> 44:34.380
Why?
You're going to be looking.

44:34.381 --> 44:37.300
Look, that's the problem!
I can't see without my glasses!

44:37.301 --> 44:38.927
So you can't look, either!

44:39.261 --> 44:42.138
Okay, okay, I won't look!
Hurry up!

44:42.139 --> 44:43.766
<i>- Promise?
- Promise!</i>

44:45.643 --> 44:47.770
Whoo!

44:48.520 --> 44:50.272
Wow, is it warm!

44:52.191 --> 44:56.110
<i>- Cover your eyes!
- Kristina, get in the water!</i>

44:56.111 --> 44:58.112
David, cover your eyes!

44:58.113 --> 45:00.782
All right, all right!

45:00.783 --> 45:03.034
Come on.
It's not getting any warmer.

45:03.035 --> 45:05.287
I'm coming.
Hey! You're peeking.

45:05.537 --> 45:08.206
No. I'm not.
Come on. Cover your eyes.

45:08.207 --> 45:10.167
Hurry up. Oh, it's nice.

45:11.085 --> 45:12.795
Ugh. It's freezing!

45:13.045 --> 45:15.338
- No, it's warm.
- It's freez... You lied!

45:15.339 --> 45:16.548
Watch out.

45:17.007 --> 45:18.550
- Hug me.
- No touching.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.760
That's not fair.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.180
No. No.

45:39.905 --> 45:42.907
<i>The skin shedding is complete...</i>

45:42.908 --> 45:45.786
<i>on schedule and no complications.</i>

45:46.078 --> 45:50.665
<i>David's body temperature is dropping
at the rate of three degrees a day.</i>

45:50.666 --> 45:54.586
<i>Should stabilize at 80 degrees
by the end of the week.</i>

45:57.756 --> 46:00.216
The prognosis is perfect.

46:00.217 --> 46:02.969
Slight flattening of the nostrils.

46:02.970 --> 46:05.471
Eyelids beginning to recede.

46:05.472 --> 46:09.810
Facets that will not be readily
apparent for several days.

46:10.144 --> 46:12.020
After that, however,

46:12.396 --> 46:15.399
the evolutionary process
should accelerate greatly.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.737
Cataclysmic changes should occur...

46:20.654 --> 46:22.573
Oh.

46:24.408 --> 46:26.744
I have you.

46:27.578 --> 46:30.205
And I set you free.

46:30.456 --> 46:32.541
Oh.

46:57.900 --> 47:00.027
- You know something?
- What?

47:00.611 --> 47:04.156
I think your father's actually worried
I might try something with you.

47:04.531 --> 47:06.866
Well, aren't you going to?

47:06.867 --> 47:09.035
Of course not.

47:09.036 --> 47:11.914
Not while you're driving, doctor.

47:12.539 --> 47:14.041
Look! A carnival!

47:26.094 --> 47:28.096
Ohhh! Whoa!

47:36.230 --> 47:39.273
Ohhh! Geez!

47:39.274 --> 47:43.986
You look terrible! Aah!

47:43.987 --> 47:47.114
Look at it!
It's the High-boy!

47:47.115 --> 47:49.158
High-low fast and safe!

47:49.159 --> 47:51.494
Sensational ride!

47:51.495 --> 47:52.621
Okay, we got a winner!

47:56.333 --> 47:58.377
All right. Here it goes, guys!

47:58.585 --> 48:00.128
All right! All right!

48:11.849 --> 48:13.684
I don't know, Morgan.

48:13.851 --> 48:16.687
Maybe you should've gone
into some other kind of work.

48:17.604 --> 48:20.648
Here, Daniel Boone.
You try it. Go ahead.

48:20.649 --> 48:22.818
- You payin'?
- I'll pay.

48:40.002 --> 48:42.588
- Feel a lot safer now, Morgan?
- Oh, yeah.

48:42.796 --> 48:46.507
If you live to be 1,000,
you may never again get the chance

48:46.508 --> 48:49.219
to see the most fantastic,
the most bizarre,

48:49.469 --> 48:51.722
the most incredible creatures
in all of creation!

48:51.889 --> 48:54.682
25 cents is all it costs.
One thin quarter.

48:54.683 --> 48:56.727
Two dimes and a nickle.
Three nickles and a dime.

48:56.894 --> 48:57.769
Anyway you add it up,

48:57.770 --> 48:59.530
it's the greatest bargain
in the whole world.

48:59.688 --> 49:01.022
Sam Lee, the seal boy.

49:01.023 --> 49:03.025
Arvin Le Deux,
the man with two noses.

49:03.233 --> 49:05.234
Joan and John Prendergast,

49:05.235 --> 49:09.031
brother and sister Siamese twins,
joined together forever at the waist.

49:09.239 --> 49:12.700
And the incredible snake man!
Half-man, half-snake.

49:12.701 --> 49:15.579
The most astonishing human reptile
in the history of the world.

49:15.787 --> 49:16.872
Let's go see.

49:17.623 --> 49:20.042
I can't stand those things.
You know they're all fake.

49:20.334 --> 49:23.754
Fake? Did I hear
the little lady say "fake"?

49:23.921 --> 49:26.339
Ladies and gentlemen,
and gentlemen and ladies,

49:26.340 --> 49:27.883
listen to me and listen well.

49:28.091 --> 49:32.803
$1,000. That's right.
A crisp, new $1,000 bill.

49:32.804 --> 49:34.096
This is my gift

49:34.097 --> 49:37.434
to the person who can prove
that the snakeman is not real.

49:37.684 --> 49:40.484
That's right. You heard me correctly.
He's inside now, waiting for you.

49:40.646 --> 49:43.439
No glass surrounds him.
No mirrors distort him.

49:43.440 --> 49:46.276
You may see him, speak to him,
touch him, if you dare.

49:46.526 --> 49:50.071
And the person that proves
that the incredible snakeman

49:50.072 --> 49:55.785
is not real, alive and as presented,
will receive $1,000 in cash.

49:55.786 --> 49:57.788
What do you say, sonny? The little
lady says the thing is a fake...

49:57.955 --> 49:58.955
Come on.
Let's go see it.

49:58.997 --> 50:00.748
All it costs is one thin quarter
to prove she's right

50:00.749 --> 50:02.583
and collect yourself $1,000 in change.

50:02.584 --> 50:05.044
- Come on. Let's go check it out.
- No. No. You go.

50:05.045 --> 50:06.797
$1,000 just to prove
the snakeman is a fake.

50:06.964 --> 50:08.255
I'll wait right here.
You go see.

50:08.256 --> 50:10.883
Real as life. One look.
Don't touch, just look.

50:10.884 --> 50:13.344
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen,
$1,000.

50:13.345 --> 50:16.515
As real as you've ever seen it before
in your whole life.

50:58.890 --> 51:00.684
Hey, baby.
This is for you.

51:02.436 --> 51:05.981
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:06.356 --> 51:09.901
And in appreciation,
I'll even let you buy me a beer.

51:10.068 --> 51:12.403
Oh, no. Really.
I'm waiting for someone.

51:12.404 --> 51:14.739
Who could be more important?

51:14.740 --> 51:18.159
Kristina, you've gotta see it.
It's incredible. It's got blue eyes.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.537
Hello, little David.
How you doing tonight?

51:21.538 --> 51:22.456
Hi, Steve. How are you?

51:22.457 --> 51:24.458
Yeah, good to see you.
Real good to see you.

51:25.667 --> 51:27.918
What are you...?
What is this?

51:27.919 --> 51:29.962
<i>- What the hell is going...?
- What are you doing?</i>

51:29.963 --> 51:31.630
Oh, don't hurt him, Steve.

51:31.631 --> 51:34.051
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

51:36.803 --> 51:40.139
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off...

51:40.140 --> 51:41.850
David, no!

51:42.142 --> 51:45.729
All right, all right. All right,
what do you think this is, an arena?

51:48.815 --> 51:50.901
Okay.

51:53.737 --> 51:55.238
Ow! Come on!

51:56.323 --> 51:57.407
Hey, cut it out!

51:57.657 --> 52:00.035
Break it up. You're ruining business
for the paying shows.

52:00.285 --> 52:01.203
Son of a bitch bit me!

52:01.204 --> 52:02.787
Hey, buddy,
you wanna go to jail?

52:02.788 --> 52:05.624
Randall, why don't you stick
to football?

52:06.166 --> 52:07.416
Now where'd you come from?

52:07.417 --> 52:11.962
- He's Dr. Stoner's assistant.
- Oh, yeah. Miss Stoner.

52:11.963 --> 52:14.006
You're Dr. Stoner's daughter.
That crazy...

52:14.007 --> 52:16.467
He's not crazy,
you goddamn Neanderthal!

52:16.468 --> 52:18.969
Neanderthal?
I don't like the sound of that!

52:18.970 --> 52:21.330
All right. This is gettin'
a little wearisome for everybody.

52:21.431 --> 52:22.849
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

52:26.812 --> 52:28.271
Randall.

52:29.689 --> 52:31.650
Goddamn it. I said, move.

52:32.109 --> 52:33.276
- Let's get out of here.
- Come on, Steve.

52:33.443 --> 52:34.444
Night, sheriff!

52:42.953 --> 52:46.539
"I think I could turn
and live with animals.

52:46.540 --> 52:49.458
They are so placid
and self-contained.

52:49.459 --> 52:53.796
I stand and look at them
long and long.

52:53.797 --> 52:57.300
They do not sweat and whine
about their condition.

52:57.717 --> 53:02.429
They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins.

53:02.430 --> 53:07.894
They do not make me sick,
discussing their duty to God.

53:09.354 --> 53:12.606
Not one is dissatisfied.

53:12.607 --> 53:17.778
Not one is demented
with the mania of owning things.

53:17.779 --> 53:20.448
Not one kneels to another,

53:20.657 --> 53:25.578
nor to his kind
that lived thousands of years ago.

53:25.579 --> 53:28.789
Not one is respectable...

53:28.790 --> 53:33.837
or unhappy over the whole Earth."

53:38.466 --> 53:41.344
Walt Whitman, Harry.

53:42.429 --> 53:44.639
A great man.

53:46.725 --> 53:50.228
Huh. The lovers return.

53:57.652 --> 54:00.905
Look sober now, Harry,

54:00.906 --> 54:06.745
or Kristine will make us
blow in a balloon.

54:58.338 --> 55:01.340
- Okay.
- It's all set. She'll do it for 10 bucks.

55:01.341 --> 55:02.967
10 bucks each
or 10 bucks for all of us?

55:02.968 --> 55:04.970
10 bucks each. What do you think,
she's some cheap hooker?

55:05.178 --> 55:08.430
I don't have to pay for it.
Never did. Never will.

55:08.431 --> 55:10.350
Hey, didn't you tell the guy
who Steve is?

55:10.558 --> 55:13.144
Yeah. I was afraid then
she'd ask for 20.

55:14.771 --> 55:16.522
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

55:16.523 --> 55:18.108
You wanna go outside and mix it up?

55:18.275 --> 55:19.566
No. Steve, no. Come on.
What's the matter with you?

55:19.567 --> 55:21.360
He's still steamed about
getting shot down by the redhead.

55:21.361 --> 55:22.528
She dug me.

55:22.529 --> 55:24.196
Sure. She just didn't
see your clippings, that's all.

55:24.197 --> 55:26.031
You'd better believe it.

55:26.032 --> 55:27.491
- Goddamn.
- Hey, what are you doing?

55:27.492 --> 55:28.410
Where are you going, Steve?

55:28.411 --> 55:29.611
- Let the jerk go.
- He's nuts.

55:39.004 --> 55:41.422
Come on, Harry.

55:41.423 --> 55:43.341
Come on.

55:59.441 --> 56:02.861
Come on. Drink it, Harry.
It'll make you feel better.

56:04.946 --> 56:06.865
Go on.

56:09.909 --> 56:11.619
That's a boy.

56:20.795 --> 56:22.964
Dr. Stoner,
why am I losing weight?

56:26.217 --> 56:27.927
I expected it.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.517
God. Feels like 40 below in here.

56:47.364 --> 56:51.201
Harry, you know,
you're getting lazy in your old age.

56:55.121 --> 56:59.751
You gotta keep physically fit if you
wanna make it in this world, Harry.

57:33.910 --> 57:36.371
Good night, Harry.

58:14.784 --> 58:18.163
- Hi, pretty baby.
- What the hell are you doing here?

58:18.329 --> 58:22.750
Get out! Get out!
No! Get out!

58:22.959 --> 58:24.294
Harry, no!

58:32.177 --> 58:33.636
Get off! Get off!

58:42.061 --> 58:43.438
Oh, no.

58:43.688 --> 58:45.565
You people are nuts!
All of you!

58:45.773 --> 58:49.694
- Keeping snakes around like that!
- Harry! Harry!

58:50.778 --> 58:52.739
Oh, no!

58:52.947 --> 58:55.116
Freaks! That's what you are!
A bunch of snake freaks!

58:57.577 --> 58:59.329
Oh, no.

59:04.626 --> 59:07.545
Do you know that boy's name?

59:15.345 --> 59:19.806
<i>"I think I could turn
and live with animals.</i>

59:19.807 --> 59:23.770
They are so placid
and self-contained.

59:24.103 --> 59:27.732
I stand and look at them long...

59:33.613 --> 59:35.949
and long."

01:00:55.153 --> 01:00:57.780
Harry was just a snake, Kris.

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:08.249
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:22.639
Look.
We'll try and find another Harry.

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:28.144
Your face.

01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:33.149
- What about it?
- I don't know. It looks different.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:37.278
Late adolescence.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.530
As for the rest of me...

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.867
Haven't you ever seen
wild-eyed passion before?

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.336
Show me.

01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:12.145
Oh, God. That hurts, honey.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:13.271
I'm sorry.

01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:16.859
Hey, weren't you frightened?
Makes me shiver to think of snakes.

01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:18.903
Have you ever seen me frightened
of anything?

01:02:19.112 --> 01:02:20.613
You're so brave.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:24.616
Right. And tired.

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:28.870
Hey, it's only 9:30.
Curfew's not until 11:00.

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:30.664
I'm serious. I'm still in training.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:32.465
Twice a night,
that's all the coach allows me.

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.127
What about weekends?

01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:36.421
Later.

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:40.842
Hey, uh, look.

01:02:41.634 --> 01:02:45.554
Francie told me that you were
like this, but I didn't believe her.

01:02:45.555 --> 01:02:47.222
You should have.
I gotta take a shower.

01:02:47.223 --> 01:02:48.975
I'll see you around.

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:17.355
 <i>On top of old Smokey</i>
<i>all covered with snow</i> 

01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:38.709
 <i>False-hearted lover</i>
<i>is worse than a thief</i>

01:04:52.557 --> 01:04:55.309
Shit!

01:04:56.978 --> 01:05:01.357
God! Oh, God! No!

01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:04.151
Get off me! God!

01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:50.865
I think you're supposed
to say something.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:01.208
I love you.

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:04.086
I... I didn't mean that.

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:11.469
I did.

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:16.598
Don't cry.

01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:18.519
Why are you crying?
There's nothing to cry about.

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:21.395
I can't see you.

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:25.232
I'm crying because
I can't find my glasses.

01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:54.303
- Oh, no.
- Shit!

01:06:55.221 --> 01:06:56.429
Oh, shit.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.431
Ow! Where's my shirt?

01:06:58.432 --> 01:06:59.516
I don't know.

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:00.851
Oh, this. That's it.

01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:46.897
Come in.

01:07:49.442 --> 01:07:51.694
Oh, Kristine.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:55.740
- You're back early.
- Yes.

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:59.785
Maybe not early enough.

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:04.331
You and David seem to be
getting along well together.

01:08:04.749 --> 01:08:07.835
- We like each other.
- Yes.

01:08:08.335 --> 01:08:13.299
Maybe we have
different definitions of "like".

01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:17.428
You're an innocent girl, Kristine.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:23.349
You've had a very sheltered life,
and I can understand how lonely...

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.560
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:28.854
Don't you think it's a little late
to be telling me

01:08:28.856 --> 01:08:30.941
about the birds and the bees?

01:08:31.192 --> 01:08:34.904
- I'm very serious, Kristina.
- Well, what do you want me to say?

01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:37.363
That you haven't slept with him.

01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:43.912
I don't think
that's any of your business.

01:08:44.497 --> 01:08:47.624
You don't understand the
consequences of what you're doing.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:49.667
Oh, come on, Dad.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:52.921
I mean, I may not be
very sophisticated,

01:08:53.089 --> 01:08:54.255
but I do think I know a little...

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:56.966
No, you don't.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:03.390
Kristina, one drop of...
David's blood could...

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:08.354
- Could what?
- Have an effect.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.524
The inoculations.

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:16.277
There's a period in which the venom
could have a damaging effect

01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:18.238
on his nervous system.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:22.535
Want you to promise me
you won't have intercourse with him.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.996
I don't think you have the right
to ask me that.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:31.669
I have more than a right.
You are a stupid little child.

01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:36.005
You don't understand
what's happening.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:40.928
And you're a stuffy, selfish,
overprotective old man,

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:44.346
and you could care less
about me or my happiness!

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:47.268
- Kristina, I want your promise!
- No!

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:53.918
David!

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.378
David! David!

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:02.800
- What is it, Kristine?
- I wanna see David right now.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:07.138
Well, he doesn't want to see you.
He's had an allergic reaction...

01:11:07.139 --> 01:11:08.431
- Look, I don't...
- to the immunization.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:10.099
His face is broken out.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.519
You're hiding something from me.
I know it. He's gonna die, isn't he?

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.481
<i>- He's not going to die. David!
- Yes?</i>

01:11:16.482 --> 01:11:19.692
<i>- How do you feel?
- Ugly.</i>

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:20.694
You see?

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:25.366
What the hell
are you laughing at?

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:28.785
Male vanity.

01:11:28.786 --> 01:11:31.496
Yeah, well, what would you do
if you woke up one morning

01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:33.499
and looked like a... beehive?

01:11:33.707 --> 01:11:37.962
- He's going to be all right, isn't he?
- Of course. Now, Kristine.

01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:59.524
I'll call you as soon as I get there.

01:11:59.525 --> 01:12:03.404
Kristina, drive carefully.

01:12:04.738 --> 01:12:08.199
I can't believe you're really letting me
do this all by myself.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.786
- It's only a snake.
- Only a snake?

01:12:11.787 --> 01:12:13.162
It's an urutu.

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:15.541
I wouldn't trust anybody else
to pick it up.

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:21.505
- I'm sorry about last night.
- So am I.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.382
Everybody forgiven?

01:12:27.845 --> 01:12:31.181
- I'll call you tonight.
- Please do.

01:12:32.558 --> 01:12:35.060
- Take care of him.
- I will.

01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:58.583
Dr, Stoner, I...
I feel... I feel terrible.

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:01.378
David, drink this.

01:13:01.712 --> 01:13:04.213
- What is it?
- A mild sedative.

01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:06.508
- No, I don't feel...
- It'll calm you.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:19.229
Doctor, what's happening to me?

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.607
You're gonna be all right, David.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.236
You've just become
hypersensitive to the venom.

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:27.862
Yeah, well, don't...

01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:30.908
Don't you think I should check
into a hospital or something?

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:33.243
You may if you like.

01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:37.623
But I'm not sure how much they know
about cobra venom infections.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:41.209
What is it?

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.669
My stomach.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:48.842
It... It feels like my insides
are being twisted.

01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:50.886
Yes.

01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:54.013
- No. No, no. Please.
- David.

01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:57.810
- No!
- David, it will relieve the pain.

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:08.487
You're gonna be fine. Just fine.

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:10.989
A little alcohol on that.

01:14:15.953 --> 01:14:17.704
I'll be right back.

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:33.512
- Hello, Carl.
- What do you want?

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:37.306
Well, uh, I have
a little piece of news for you,

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:40.143
and, uh, I thought
rather than call,

01:14:40.144 --> 01:14:42.479
you'd appreciate it
if I came by and told you personally.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:46.483
Are you sure the college can manage
without you for an afternoon?

01:14:47.818 --> 01:14:51.362
Class is suspended for the day
for the funeral of one of the students.

01:14:51.363 --> 01:14:53.782
Steve Randall,
the team's star fullback.

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:55.783
It's a dangerous game, football.

01:14:55.784 --> 01:14:57.661
I've always thought
it should be outlawed.

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:01.039
Oh, he didn't die of a football injury.
Heart attack.

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:02.583
Too bad.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:08.338
- David around?
- Working in the lab.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:09.755
I'd like to say hello to him.

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.757
Uh, look.
I have just said that we're busy,

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:13.886
and you just said that you had
something to tell me.

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:17.221
Well, I was gonna try
to soften the blow,

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:20.893
but since you're not being very civil,
I might just as well drop it on ya.

01:15:21.185 --> 01:15:24.313
The board rejected your request
for an extension of the grant.

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:27.483
Fine. Good-bye.

01:15:27.733 --> 01:15:29.234
You don't seem very upset about it.

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:34.198
I'm too busy to bother about it now.
Just too busy.

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:44.124
- Feeling better?
- Doctor, what is this?

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:47.002
I feel like my guts
are being rearranged.

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:49.671
Your system is changing
to assimilate the venom.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.003
It's time for you to lie down.

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:17.861
- Where are we?
- The storm cellar.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:21.740
It's almost soundproof,
in case you're considering shouting.

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:24.993
Shouting?

01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:31.792
You're goddamn right
I'm gonna shout.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.297
- What are you doing to that boy?
- Call it a Halloween prank.

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:43.053
His face... was distorted.

01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:47.431
It looked like he was turning
into a snake or something.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:49.350
Very perceptive of you.

01:18:49.351 --> 01:18:51.520
But, of course, you know
that's impossible, don't you?

01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:56.316
All I know is you're insane,
and I intend to have you locked up.

01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:04.907
What is this?
Is this some kind of joke?

01:19:04.908 --> 01:19:07.411
I hope you find it amusing.

01:19:07.619 --> 01:19:11.957
There's a key for that lock
in those tanks.

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:15.751
You know, I was so impressed
with your lecture on the difference

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:18.170
between the coral snake
and the king.

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.215
You know,
"red touch yellow, kill a fellow"?

01:19:21.216 --> 01:19:23.843
I was hoping
you might enlighten me

01:19:23.844 --> 01:19:26.346
on the difference
between these two.

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:30.058
Now, in one of these tanks,
we have the Western Hognose,

01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:32.477
which we both know
is completely harmless.

01:19:32.644 --> 01:19:37.149
And in one of these tanks
is the Hognose Pit Viper,

01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:40.277
which we both know
is highly venomous.

01:19:41.236 --> 01:19:45.991
You have a decision to make.
I advise you to make a good one.

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.537
You're free to go
whenever you wish.

01:19:50.787 --> 01:19:53.456
Just reach in a tank and pick a key.

01:19:53.457 --> 01:19:57.252
I'm sure you won't have any trouble
picking the right key...

01:19:57.919 --> 01:20:00.172
Dr. Daniels.

01:20:22.027 --> 01:20:23.320
Of course.

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.151
What?

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.169
- Hello.
- Dad.

01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:07.299
I'm here at the cargo office, and they
don't seem to have any record of it.

01:22:07.549 --> 01:22:10.468
They don't? That's odd.

01:22:10.635 --> 01:22:14.973
Well, you know Brazilian mail, Kristy.
It's about as botched up as our own.

01:22:16.224 --> 01:22:18.894
Right.
Well, do you have the order?

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:22.063
No. The shipping agent phoned.

01:22:35.327 --> 01:22:36.912
What was that?

01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:40.457
- Uh, bad connection.
- How's David?

01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:44.961
- He's greatly improved.
- Can I talk to him?

01:22:45.337 --> 01:22:47.088
At the moment, he's resting.

01:22:47.589 --> 01:22:51.383
Oh. Well, make sure you tell him
I asked about him.

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:52.426
Yes.

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:54.094
What do you want me to do
about the urutu?

01:22:54.095 --> 01:22:58.515
Well, when it arrives,
tell them to hold it,

01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:00.936
and we'll make some kind
of arrangements to get it here.

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:04.521
Okay. Well, listen,
I'll wait here until morning,

01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:07.149
and if it doesn't arrive,
I'll just drive back again.

01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.734
<i>Fine.</i>

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:11.112
And don't forget
to tell David I called.

01:23:11.363 --> 01:23:15.575
- I won't, Kristy. Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

01:23:29.589 --> 01:23:31.466
Kristina sends her love.

01:23:34.594 --> 01:23:37.180
You so interested in snakes,
I got a beauty for ya.

01:23:37.347 --> 01:23:39.182
Oh, yeah?
What kind of snake?

01:23:39.391 --> 01:23:43.435
Don't know the name of it, but it sure
is the biggest one I ever saw.

01:23:43.436 --> 01:23:46.230
Fella down at the carnival's
got it in his freak show.

01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:49.817
Half-snake and half-man.
Sure worth a look-see.

01:23:49.818 --> 01:23:52.237
Oh, come on. You don't really
believe all that stuff, do you?

01:23:52.737 --> 01:23:55.197
I've seen a lot of freak shows.

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:56.448
Used to be a donnicker man

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:59.284
with the Westcott Brothers
Amusements of the World.

01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:03.623
53 years on the circuit,
never seen one like that before.

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:07.584
Well, I'm sure it's just a python
made to look like a man.

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:10.171
His blue eyes sure fooled me.

01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:12.173
Never heard of a snake
with blue eyes.

01:24:14.134 --> 01:24:18.512
- Where did you say this carnival was?
- Couple of blocks down off Main.

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:21.725
Better hurry though, because
they'd be closin' down about now.

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:28.565
There's sure one born every minute,
ain't there?

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:24.787
Patch says that he can't spring
Chip until next Wednesday.

01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:28.165
He keeps gaffing that wheel,
Jimmy Jr.'s gonna dump him.

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.417
Chip gives the whole show
a bad rap.

01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:32.711
Marks don't believe
in nothing anymore.

01:25:32.712 --> 01:25:33.712
Yeah.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.301
Come on in. Come on in.

01:25:38.927 --> 01:25:40.303
Here, sit down.
Take the load off.

01:25:40.845 --> 01:25:43.263
I know you're closed, but, uh,

01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:45.850
I was wondering if you would
let me see the snakeman?

01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:50.647
The snakeman?
Well, how do you like that?

01:25:50.939 --> 01:25:53.650
The snakeman's got himself
a late date with a little chicken.

01:25:57.821 --> 01:26:01.240
- He expectin' you?
- I know this sounds crazy.

01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:03.242
But, you see,
I know a lot about snakes,

01:26:03.243 --> 01:26:05.662
and I was just wondering
if you would let me see him.

01:26:06.204 --> 01:26:08.705
Well, the snakeman's sleeping now.

01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:11.026
You come back tomorrow,
and you can have a nice, long look.

01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:14.546
- I'll be glad to pay you.
- I told you, he's sleeping.

01:26:15.046 --> 01:26:18.383
You see, this is an entertainment,
girlie, it's not an all-night diner.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:23.637
I don't think it's clear to you how very
important it is for me to see him.

01:26:23.638 --> 01:26:25.431
You heard me. Beat it.

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:30.270
<i>- Good night, honey.
- See you around, baby.</i>

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:31.603
Hoo-hoo.

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.483
All right.

01:27:33.124 --> 01:27:35.001
Oh, God!

01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:37.212
Oh, Tim!

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:41.382
Oh, no! Oh, Tim!

01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:47.013
Oh, Tim!

01:27:59.651 --> 01:28:01.819
Hey! Hey, you!

01:28:06.366 --> 01:28:08.451
Hey, you! Come back here!

01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:29.806
Oh, no. No, not David, too. No.

01:28:30.598 --> 01:28:31.724
No.

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:34.143
<i>- Dale?
- Hmm?</i>

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:37.354
- There's a girl here to see you.
- Well, she pretty?

01:28:37.355 --> 01:28:40.775
She's pretty upset.
She says she killed Steve Randall.

01:28:42.277 --> 01:28:44.653
I knew he was in training.

01:28:44.654 --> 01:28:48.658
I mean, I knew it was bad
for athletes to get overexerted.

01:28:49.617 --> 01:28:52.912
But I couldn't help myself.
I loved him too much.

01:28:53.538 --> 01:28:56.207
Well, just how much
did you love him?

01:28:57.375 --> 01:29:01.170
Three times. His poor heart!

01:29:01.462 --> 01:29:04.465
- Three times?
- I mean, he looked a little tired.

01:29:04.716 --> 01:29:09.052
He told me this story
about how he killed this snake.

01:29:09.053 --> 01:29:12.557
Snake? I don't know
anything about that.

01:29:13.683 --> 01:29:15.976
This girl made a pass at him.

01:29:15.977 --> 01:29:18.771
Girls are always making passes
at Steve.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.899
He took her home,

01:29:22.233 --> 01:29:25.903
and it turned out
that she was Dr. Stoner's daughter.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:28.197
And there was this big snake.

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:30.533
Stoner.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.784
Excuse me, Dale.

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:35.120
I just got a call
from Dr. Daniels's wife.

01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:37.457
She's worried because he didn't
come home last night.

01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:39.833
Well, tell her to check
the girls' dorms.

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:43.629
Well, the last she heard,
he was on his way to Stoner's place.

01:29:46.758 --> 01:29:47.758
Stoner.

01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:50.887
All right.

01:29:53.973 --> 01:29:55.932
Let's go.

01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:57.643
Thank you, miss.

01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:17.705
The last one, David.

01:30:19.916 --> 01:30:23.711
And, unfortunately, the most painful.

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:28.965
- But think of it as your baptism.
- Oh, no.

01:30:28.966 --> 01:30:32.720
The final agony of your old life
as a puny human.

01:30:34.389 --> 01:30:38.142
And the beginning
of your new existence.

01:30:38.518 --> 01:30:42.939
A new existence for all mankind.

01:30:43.147 --> 01:30:46.691
You are the future, David.

01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:50.655
Just as Adam was the first man,

01:30:51.114 --> 01:30:54.617
you are the first creature
of the next evolution.

01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:59.788
You will survive pollution,
the holocaust, the famines,

01:30:59.789 --> 01:31:01.499
and the plagues
that will make man extinct.

01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:05.461
You will survive and multiply
and prevail.

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.061
Hit it.

01:32:56.072 --> 01:32:58.157
Long live the king.

01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:13.506
A new life, David.

01:33:15.258 --> 01:33:18.553
A bright, clean new life.

01:33:31.023 --> 01:33:34.402
Your Highness,
I'd like an audience with you.

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:37.029
I command it.

01:34:14.066 --> 01:34:20.615
Your Majesty, I regret to inform you,
there is a pretender to your throne.

01:34:21.282 --> 01:34:24.326
A king with the power of a cobra,

01:34:24.327 --> 01:34:29.415
but with the intelligence of a man.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.793
The creature is different from...

01:34:43.638 --> 01:34:47.725
A creature who is different from...

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:57.860
It's natural for you to resist change.

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:02.822
And...

01:35:04.659 --> 01:35:08.329
change is the hope...

01:35:08.537 --> 01:35:11.707
of the world.

01:35:13.626 --> 01:35:18.005
Great... change...

01:35:22.176 --> 01:35:24.136
is...

01:36:20.818 --> 01:36:24.279
Dad! Dad!

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.656
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:36:26.657 --> 01:36:29.826
Dad, I saw Tim! I saw him!

01:36:29.827 --> 01:36:33.581
What did you do to David?
Dad! Dad!

01:36:59.899 --> 01:37:03.402
David! Da-David!

01:37:18.417 --> 01:37:20.252
My father's dead!

01:37:27.343 --> 01:37:31.639
David! David!

01:37:35.476 --> 01:37:38.604
No! No! David, no!

01:37:38.896 --> 01:37:41.940
No! No!

01:37:41.941 --> 01:37:44.902
Oh, no! David!
