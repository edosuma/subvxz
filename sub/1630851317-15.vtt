00:02.089 --> 00:05.266
<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:05.309 --> 00:07.703
I have no idea why
we don't do these

00:07.746 --> 00:09.531
mother-daughter coffee
dates more often.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.228
I agree.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.969
Now that we don't
work together anymore,

00:13.013 --> 00:15.276
we can just be gal pals.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.582
Sure.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.718
If you could just sign this.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.415
What is it?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.982
Something to make sure
that business

00:26.026 --> 00:28.115
doesn't get in
the way of family.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.508
It's just a silly
little document that states

00:30.552 --> 00:32.641
any ideas you
thought of at MaxDot

00:32.684 --> 00:34.686
are property of MaxDot.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.427
I-I don't understand.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.038
It's very standard language.

00:38.081 --> 00:41.476
You hated every one of my ideas
when I worked there.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.999
Honey, just because
I hated them

00:43.043 --> 00:44.696
doesn't mean they're not mine.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.096
Is this the only
- cheese Danish?
- It is.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.532
- Anyone mind?
- Help yourself.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.404
But I got it for Mr. Wheeler.

00:56.447 --> 00:59.537
Oh.

00:59.581 --> 01:00.843
Morning, everybody.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.280
- Morning, Mr. Wheeler.
- Morning.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.109
Hey, Douglas, way to be
early for the meeting.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.416
There's a meeting?

01:08.459 --> 01:10.896
Yeah, there's a meeting.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.205
We're updating our
marketing strategy.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.164
What's wrong with the one
we got now?

01:17.207 --> 01:19.427
The only thing we have
is a 30-year-old ad

01:19.470 --> 01:20.428
in <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

01:20.471 --> 01:23.605
Damn, she's hot.

01:23.648 --> 01:24.867
Yep, I was a looker.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.565
Oh, God.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.264
I would like to propose
that we produce

01:30.307 --> 01:33.528
a series of commercials
for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram,

01:33.571 --> 01:34.746
all of social media.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.835
Or an infomercial for TV.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.142
No one watches TV anymore.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.450
- I do.
- Then we should make an infomercial for TV.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.887
Great. Thanks, everybody.
Nice work, Kofo.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.921
Is everyone logged on?

02:18.964 --> 02:21.489
Mom, you're muted.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.968
You're still muted.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.883
Aw, to hell with this
stupid damn thing!

02:24.927 --> 02:27.147
We can hear you now.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.191
Okay, now we can't see.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.585
Leave it alone.
Kofo, go ahead.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.414
I want to introduce you
to Marion Mitchell,

02:33.457 --> 02:36.765
producer and director of many
successful TV commercials,

02:36.808 --> 02:39.463
including the beloved
mesothelioma one.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.073
Oh, those are great.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.684
I think I have that.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.121
Marion, are you there?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.905
Hello. Can everyone see me?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.733
Yes.
No.

02:48.777 --> 02:49.952
Marion, why don't you...

02:49.995 --> 02:51.606
Now I can see her.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.913
Why don't you tell us why
you want to work with MaxDot?

02:54.957 --> 02:57.220
I don't know that I do.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.048
What the hell is
this broad's problem?

02:59.091 --> 03:01.398
Mom, you're not muted.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.401
Let me explain something
about television commercials.

03:04.445 --> 03:08.013
People don't buy the product,
they buy the story.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.798
I need to know what
MaxDot's story is

03:09.841 --> 03:12.453
before I agree
to do the job.

03:12.496 --> 03:17.240
You mean like how, uh,
- - Spider-
- Man became Spider-
- Man?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.460
Exactly.

03:19.503 --> 03:23.203
I think he got bit by
a radioactive spider.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.814
MaxDot is the leading distributor

03:25.857 --> 03:27.424
of therapeutic hosiery...

03:27.468 --> 03:28.556
And who are you?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.297
I'm Bob Wheeler.
I run the company.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.515
No, honey.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.517
I allow you to
run the company.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.302
We all run the company.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.826
You definitely don't
run the company.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.828
Leave Douglas alone.
He's just trying to

03:39.871 --> 03:41.612
hook up with Blondie.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.571
Anyway, it's my company.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.268
There it is.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.531
What?
The story.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.404
MaxDot is a family company.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.015
You bicker, you love, and
somehow you make it all work.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.191
That is what people
want to see.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.801
All right, I'm in.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.933
We'll start shooting
next week.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.152
What the hell just happened?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.415
We got the job!

04:04.418 --> 04:06.028
Mom, what are you doing?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.377
Still fits!

04:07.421 --> 04:09.379
Oh, God.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.341
This is so exciting.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.386
We've always loved
American commercials.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.083
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.085
They make us laugh,
they make us cry,

04:20.129 --> 04:24.307
They make us crave a taco
wrapped inside a quesadilla.

04:24.351 --> 04:27.223
Well, I just hope <i>
our</i> commercial works.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.659
Why wouldn't it?

04:28.703 --> 04:31.532
Well, the director wants to
shine a light on my family.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.883
My family's better
in the dark.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.886
I love your family.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.062
Now. But how about
when you first met 'em?

04:41.324 --> 04:43.195
Oh...

04:44.458 --> 04:46.460
I just hope we can stay focused
on the socks

04:46.503 --> 04:49.201
and not turn it into some
crazy reality show.

04:49.245 --> 04:53.031
Like the Kardashians.
America's family.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.903
But would you buy socks
from them?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.209
Tunde and I have been
loving their shapewear.

04:57.253 --> 05:00.125
Oh, very slimming.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.303
Well, I remember when
a crazy Wheeler

05:03.346 --> 05:06.262
knocked on my door
offering me socks.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.481
Now I'm married
to the lunatic

05:07.524 --> 05:09.613
and wearing those socks.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.180
And if I'd have
brought you roses,

05:11.223 --> 05:12.660
would we still be
sitting here right now?

05:12.703 --> 05:15.010
Absolutely not.
What a waste of money.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.800
This commercial will be
the perfect opportunity

05:22.844 --> 05:24.498
for you to reinvent yourself.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.500
Uh-uh. What is wrong
with the way I am?

05:26.543 --> 05:28.850
Oh, Abishola.
So innocent.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.421
Okay, so this first one
I like to call

05:34.464 --> 05:37.032
the Gayle King.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.426
Conservative but playful.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.775
Anybody can talk to you

05:40.818 --> 05:42.472
because you appear warm
and friendly.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.474
But I am not warm
and friendly.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.302
Good point.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.697
How about...

05:49.740 --> 05:51.960
the Beyoncé Balayage?

05:52.003 --> 05:55.355
Sexy, strong-willed
and dominating.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.965
- I like that.
- Mm-hmm?

05:57.008 --> 05:59.097
Why you bring your hair to work?

06:00.838 --> 06:03.232
If Abishola is going to be
in Bob's commercial,

06:03.275 --> 06:06.061
she must shine bright,
like a diamond.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.106
Oh, you gonna be
in a commercial?

06:08.150 --> 06:10.282
For MaxDot. Bob wants
the whole family in it.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.502
That's great.
You got any lines?

06:12.546 --> 06:14.243
I do.

06:14.286 --> 06:17.594
As a nurse,
I walk all day at work...

06:17.638 --> 06:18.769
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.684
What?

06:20.728 --> 06:22.817
Do you know who buys
compression socks?

06:22.860 --> 06:24.862
Old white people.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.690
Do you know who cannot
understand an accent

06:26.734 --> 06:27.865
that is not from Iowa?

06:27.909 --> 06:29.780
Old white people.

06:29.824 --> 06:32.696
People can understand me
- perfectly well.
- Ehh.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.221
What is the pan you
stir-fry vegetables in?

06:36.265 --> 06:37.484
- Wok.
- And what is it you do all day?

06:37.527 --> 06:40.138
Work.

06:40.182 --> 06:44.360
Say "Walter drinks water while
he walks to work."

06:44.404 --> 06:47.102
Walter drinks water
while he walks to work.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.062
Child, it ain't just
the old white people

06:51.106 --> 06:53.151
that can't understand you.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.243
So the first setup's
gonna be over here.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.379
This is so exciting.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.599
I had no idea it took
so many people

07:05.642 --> 07:08.253
and all this equipment
just to make a commercial.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.692
Here, take a picture
with me. Ah.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.476
Say "Hollywood."

07:13.520 --> 07:15.522
Hollywood.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.828
Believe how far we've come?

07:17.872 --> 07:19.177
You and dad selling socks

07:19.221 --> 07:20.657
out of the trunk of
your Oldsmobile,

07:20.701 --> 07:22.790
now we're making
a national TV commercial.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.922
I wish your father
could see this.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.881
He does see it, Mom.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.579
I can feel his presence.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.842
Well, I didn't feel yours.
What's she doing here?

07:31.886 --> 07:34.105
- I asked her.
- Why?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.064
She might not be
part of the company anymore,

07:36.107 --> 07:37.021
but she's still part
of the family.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.545
I disagree.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.677
She left us for
another sock company.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.200
She's dead to me.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.419
How can you say that?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.116
Fine, she's in a coma.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.858
Either way, I don't want her
in the commercial.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.643
Mom, come on.
See?

07:49.686 --> 07:51.166
I told you she would
be like this.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.559
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.475
Hey, guys they just put out
pigs in a blanket.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.694
Do you know what we call
pigs in a blanket in Nigeria?

07:57.738 --> 07:59.000
What?

07:59.043 --> 08:00.001
Pigs in a blanket.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.960
Hey, that's funny.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.440
What do you mean?

08:11.186 --> 08:13.231
Who is it?

08:13.275 --> 08:15.582
Bob.
Are you alone?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.192
Yeah.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.367
Come in.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.459
You have one daughter.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.678
Is this really how
you want to treat her?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.767
Get out.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.943
I'm not doing the commercial
without my sister.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.553
Well, then, I guess
there's no commercial.

08:30.597 --> 08:34.296
So you're good wasting
thousands of dollars

08:34.339 --> 08:36.777
just to prove your
petty little point?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.301
My point is not petty.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.303
She chose to leave this family.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.392
She didn't leave the family,
she left the job.

08:43.435 --> 08:44.828
It's the same thing.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.830
None of us want to be here,
but we stick it out

08:46.874 --> 08:48.658
'cause we love each other,
damn it.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.053
I hope Dad's not
seeing us now.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.011
Don't you use your
father against me.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.492
I'm not. I just think he would
want us to be together

08:56.536 --> 08:59.234
to celebrate what he's built.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.410
Oh, we're not here.
Keep talking.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.325
No. No, and no.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.547
Please, Mom.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.987
When she left,
she broke my heart.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.293
I know.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.686
And when I begged her
to come back,

09:16.730 --> 09:18.558
she might as well have
just spit in my face.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.647
Begged her?
You threatened to sue her.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.692
Because I'm her mother,
and I love her.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.956
Oh, my God.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.437
Would you just give us two... Oh.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.179
I just wanted to
let you know I'm leaving.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.223
Well, hang on.
Before you go,

09:32.267 --> 09:33.224
Mom wanted to talk to you.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.270
Good luck, everybody.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.233
Look, I'm sorry I upset you.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.366
I just came to be supportive.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.324
You came to rub my nose in it

09:46.368 --> 09:48.675
that you had this commercial
idea five years ago.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.155
You remember that?

09:51.199 --> 09:52.722
Yeah, I remember it.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.420
I remember everything
I ignore.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.771
But you
were right.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.990
It was a good idea.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.688
Really?

10:01.731 --> 10:03.864
I'm not gonna say it again.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.562
Thank you.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.956
And I'm sorry
I couldn't be the daughter

10:08.999 --> 10:10.174
you wanted me to be.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.307
Don't be ridiculous.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.136
What mother doesn't want
a fixer-upper?

10:15.179 --> 10:19.140
Well, I still have plenty
that needs to be fixed.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.534
Baloney. You're killing it
at that new job.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.189
I really am.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.409
But my love life is a mess.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.889
'Cause you don't respect
- yourself.
- I know.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.413
And you give it away
too easy.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.633
I know.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.112
Come here.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.548
I love you, Mom.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.072
I love you, too,
my darling.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.563
Okay, why don't we just
rehearse one,

10:51.607 --> 10:53.435
- see how it goes?
- Sounds good.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.915
Whenever you're ready.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.442
When you buy a pair of socks
from MaxDot,

11:00.485 --> 11:03.097
you're not just a customer,
you're part of the family.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.664
Isn't that right, Abishola?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.187
Mm-hmm.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.886
Honey, you have a line here.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.714
Mm-hmm.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.890
Is there a problem?

11:13.934 --> 11:15.500
Mm-mm.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.459
- Can we just have a moment?
- Sure.

11:17.502 --> 11:20.941
Hey, you okay?

11:20.984 --> 11:23.726
No. I don't want to do this.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.815
- Why not?
- This is your company.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.556
You should be the one
to talk about it.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.950
Well, the idea is
the whole family

11:29.993 --> 11:31.603
talks about it together.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.913
Walter drinks water
while he walks to work.

11:36.957 --> 11:40.090
- What?
- Exactly. You cannot understand me.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.659
Yes, I can. And who
the hell is Walter?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.313
You only understand me
because you have learned to.

11:45.356 --> 11:48.098
What about the old white people
who watch the commercial?

11:48.142 --> 11:50.405
- Well, what about 'em?
- They will not understand me,

11:50.448 --> 11:52.015
and they will not buy
your socks.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.670
Well, if they're
anything like me,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.542
they will fall in love with you
the moment you say "Bob."

11:57.586 --> 12:01.242
That's not one of my lines.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.939
Well, we'll put it in, then.

12:02.983 --> 12:05.725
I just don't want
to embarrass you.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.901
You could never
embarrass me.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.120
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.951
And cut.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.213
What?

12:17.475 --> 12:19.260
I thought we
were rehearsing.

12:19.303 --> 12:22.785
Oh, that's just what you say
to get the real stuff.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.179
Oh, no. Please don't put
that in the commercial.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.964
You sure?
Real emotion like that?

12:28.008 --> 12:29.661
That's what makes money.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.055
Well, in that case,
we'll do it again.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.665
This time, I'll cry.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.325
No one tells you how important
foot circulation is.

12:41.369 --> 12:44.807
My husband's varicose veins
caused him much pain.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.766
And they were
painful to look at.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.811
But those veins
have been tamed

12:48.855 --> 12:52.206
thanks to
MaxDot compression socks.

12:52.249 --> 12:55.862
And now he has the circulation
of a man 20 years his junior.

12:55.905 --> 12:59.343
My stamina is back
on the pickleball court.

12:59.387 --> 13:02.651
Amongst other places.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.394
MaxDot socks
saved my calves

13:06.437 --> 13:08.483
and my marriage.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.008
Cut.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.619
Boy, you two are fantastic.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.666
I have a short film I'm doing
- that you would be perfect for. Oh,

13:17.709 --> 13:18.710
- wonderful.
- How do you feel

13:18.754 --> 13:19.755
about nudity?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.887
Well, if it serves
the story,

13:20.930 --> 13:21.975
then so will I.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.849
Hello.

13:26.893 --> 13:30.766
My name is
Goodwin Aderibigbe Olayiwola.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.377
When I came to America,

13:33.421 --> 13:37.773
I was one of the first employees
of MaxDot socks.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.210
I thought
I had found a job,

13:40.254 --> 13:43.387
but what I really found
was a home.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.259
That is right, Goodwin.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.696
Hello.

13:47.739 --> 13:52.396
I am Kofoworola
Omogoriola Olanipekun.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.444
Even though I began working here
many years after my cousin,

13:56.487 --> 13:58.707
MaxDot saw my potential

13:58.750 --> 14:01.101
and soon promoted
me above him.

14:01.144 --> 14:04.191
He is
an American success story.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.542
And in your own way,
cousin, so are you.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.894
This is gonna sell you
a lot of socks.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.766
This is gonna bite
me right in the ass.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.334
Hi.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.988
I'm Dottie Wheeler.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.556
When my husband Max and I
started this company

14:21.599 --> 14:23.819
almost 50 years ago Dottie,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.429
I'm gonna have
to stop you there.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.475
Why? I was nailing it.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.565
I heard the words.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.090
But I didn't feel them.

14:34.134 --> 14:37.093
So, louder?

14:37.137 --> 14:39.400
How did your husband die?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.881
- What?
- Max. Your husband?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.883
That must have been devastating.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.974
It was the
saddest day of my life.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.325
It's hard enough when it
happens, but the worst part?

14:51.368 --> 14:53.631
Every morning
when I wake up,

14:53.675 --> 14:56.460
for a split second,

14:56.504 --> 14:58.941
I think he's here.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.813
But then you remember
he died.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.253
Uh-huh.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.254
There it is!

15:07.297 --> 15:08.429
Hold that!

15:08.472 --> 15:09.778
- What?
- Now throw it all away!

15:11.345 --> 15:13.564
And action!

15:14.565 --> 15:16.350
Hi.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.308
I'm Dottie Wheeler.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.180
When my husband

15:20.223 --> 15:23.226
Max and I started this company
almost 50 years ago,

15:23.270 --> 15:24.836
we didn't have much.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.231
Just a love of socks
and each other.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.973
But we knew

15:31.017 --> 15:33.628
we wanted MaxDot
to be a family company.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.195
Which not only included

15:35.238 --> 15:36.979
our three beautiful children,

15:37.023 --> 15:40.417
Bob, Christina and Douglas,

15:40.461 --> 15:44.334
but also
all the wonderful people

15:44.378 --> 15:46.510
who work at MaxDot.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.425
Even though Max is gone...

15:48.469 --> 15:50.775
I know she's
just saying lines,

15:50.819 --> 15:54.736
but they're the lines
I always wanted to hear.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.608
It's like she really loves us.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.830
Makes up for a
lot of hugs that never happened.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.051
Will the three of you
shut the hell up?!

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
I'm trying to sell socks.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.058
My children

16:12.101 --> 16:15.452
are the backbone
of this company.

16:20.457 --> 16:24.026
I'm Bob Wheeler,
president and CEO of MaxDot.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.028
When you buy
a pair of MaxDot socks,

16:26.072 --> 16:28.596
you're not just a customer.
You're part of the family.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.076
Isn't that right, Abishola?

16:30.119 --> 16:32.165
That's right, Bob.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.515
We love our...

16:34.558 --> 16:37.039
- MaxDot socks.
- MaxDot socks.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.390
Married couples
love MaxDot socks.

16:42.349 --> 16:46.179
MaxDot employees
love MaxDot socks.

16:49.878 --> 16:53.055
Medical professionals
love MaxDot socks.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.015
We rely on them every day.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.625
Isn't that right, Abishola?

16:57.668 --> 16:59.540
Mm-hmm!

17:00.802 --> 17:03.457
So, the next time we see you,
don't be shy.
