WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:02.294
Previously on Cruel Summer...

00:02.294 --> 00:04.588
This is security footage
from the Chambers' driveway

00:04.588 --> 00:07.132
from midnight till 7 a. m.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.843
I have a warrant
for Megan's computer.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.803
It's so obvious.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.555
You and Luke.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.350
He's the one
you want to be with, not me.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.809
Race you in. Come on.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.561
(screaming)

00:19.561 --> 00:21.522
Megan, something...

00:21.522 --> 00:23.482
something happened
at the Plunge today.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.069
She kissed me.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.657
(modem beeping)

00:42.876 --> 00:44.461
(upbeat music playing)

00:44.461 --> 00:46.547
♪ Yes ♪

00:46.547 --> 00:48.257
DJ:
Good morning, Chatham!

00:48.257 --> 00:50.300
Time to wake up
and get on out there,

00:50.300 --> 00:53.220
soak up some
of the last rays of summer.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.682
(groaning)

01:04.314 --> 01:07.526
Tell me it was just a bad dream.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.070
I wish I could.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.905
Mm, my God!

01:11.905 --> 01:14.116
It was so awkward.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.285
Oh, it just...

01:16.285 --> 01:18.120
sounds a little sloppy.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.163
Izz, he almost barfed
in my face.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.083
Well, maybe someday
you'll tell people

01:23.083 --> 01:25.377
that that's the moment that you
realized how much you loved him.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.045
-(giggles)
-Yeah.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.547
No!

01:31.633 --> 01:34.469
Maybe it's a sign that we're
not supposed to be together.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.765
Or it's just proof
he has a weak stomach.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.811
What do I do now?

01:42.811 --> 01:45.480
Just... just pretend
it never happened.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.777
One day,
when the time is right...

01:52.738 --> 01:54.865
the universe
will give you a do-over.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.301
Happy last day
of the 20th century.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.970
Ready to party
like the world's gonna end?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.222
More like ready
for it to be tomorrow
so people stop asking that.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.478
How was the Plunge?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.439
It was cold.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.940
Wet.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.402
I'm glad I did it, but
I don't need to do it again.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.451
My big New Year's resolution
this year is to start fresh.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.995
You know, really
put last year behind.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.457
And try to be less of a slob,
of course, but...

02:45.457 --> 02:48.377
Well, you do like it messy,
don't you?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.175
(knock on door)

03:02.808 --> 03:04.184
Tom?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.561
Good morning.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.397
Wh-What's going on?

03:08.397 --> 03:10.607
I got a call from the sheriff.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.275
We need to go down
to the station.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.527
Why?

03:13.527 --> 03:17.030
He didn't give many details.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.324
Just that you're
officially being charged.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.417
(electronic warbling,
squelching)

03:37.008 --> 03:39.511
I swear I'm never
drinking again.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.971
Everybody says that.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.056
But after a couple days
of detox,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.933
you'll be ready to retox.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.768
You're such an optimist.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.270
Not about this house.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.147
We have a lot
of cleaning to do.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.442
Yeah. Debbie found a cup
of beer in her closet.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.318
At least I hope it was beer.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.947
Eww! What kind of animal
leaves one sock behind?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.824
Probably a species named Tim.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.826
Eww. I don't even wanna think

04:02.826 --> 04:04.536
about what happened
to the other one.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.455
Isabella: (sighs)
Better check Debbie's closet.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.083
Maybe don't?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.546
-Luke: Hey.
-(door closes)

04:14.546 --> 04:16.256
Um... What--
what are you doing here?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.844
Good morning to you, too.

04:20.844 --> 04:21.928
Sorry. Hi.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.180
Hey, Isabella.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.098
He lives.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.558
Yeah, I, um...

04:26.558 --> 04:28.810
I just-- I came by to--

04:28.810 --> 04:30.020
To help clean up?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.774
What a gentleman.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.233
Hmm.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.196
(smooth jazz playing)

04:39.196 --> 04:44.284
Yeah, so Tim got a keg,
but I kinda wanna crank it up.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.455
Get some Y2-Kocktails,
make 'em Y2-Krazy.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.998
Get people Y2-Krunk.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.708
Y2-Kut it out.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.503
You're like a walking dad joke.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.005
I can't believe people actually
think the world's gonna end.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.590
Yeah, I know, uh...

04:58.590 --> 05:00.759
Some guy at the station
was talking about UFOs landing.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.471
I'd be more worried
about computers crashing

05:04.471 --> 05:05.764
than little green men.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.103
Hey, um...

05:12.103 --> 05:15.649
yesterday, at the Plunge...

05:15.649 --> 05:18.318
what do you think Isabella
was after when she kissed you?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.195
Um...

05:20.195 --> 05:21.488
I don't know.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.325
Why? Did she say something?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.327
Megan:
No. Not a word.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.995
I don't know, it's just,
she was...

05:28.995 --> 05:30.705
all for us getting together
in the first place.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.832
It doesn't make sense.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.375
Well...

05:33.375 --> 05:34.543
now, put this on.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.548
Okay. Now... now you're perfect.

05:41.925 --> 05:45.637
You know how Isabella is,
she's kind of jealous.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.639
Possessive.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.475
She doesn't really like it
when we do stuff without her.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.936
I've never felt that.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.981
Really? I thought
it was kind of obvious.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.901
I feel like the truth is
that she is always happiest
when we're in a rough place,

05:59.901 --> 06:02.696
'cause then she gets to,
you know, swoop in with her cape

06:02.696 --> 06:04.489
and play Super BFF.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.074
But things are so good
with us now.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.701
Things are hella good.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.040
And when we're strong,
nothing can come in between us.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.292
Not even her.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.213
Maybe that's the problem.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.632
Maybe she wants to break us up

06:22.632 --> 06:25.677
so that she can have you
all to herself.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.853
Spend money on a good PI,
you get real results.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.732
-What the hell?
-Yeah.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.235
Apparently Megan has become
some kind of hacker for hire.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.613
She breaks into websites,
she steals information,

06:44.613 --> 06:46.406
she sells it
to interested buyers.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.660
-Wow.
-Hmm.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.704
And look
who brought her into it.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.539
Oh, she...

06:54.539 --> 06:56.750
she's working with that nut job?

06:56.750 --> 06:57.959
Steve:
Apparently.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.756
You know, Ned Faunce
has been after me for years.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.092
Complaints, lawsuits, threats.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.594
The guy's unhinged.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.472
Yeah, for sure.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.685
Yeah, but... why would he
want to kill Luke?

07:15.685 --> 07:19.022
Okay, remember that scuffle
in the parking lot?

07:19.022 --> 07:21.274
That was about Megan--
Luke was trying to defend her.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.943
So what if Faunce
finally snapped,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.112
he bumps into Luke at the cabin
and he kills him?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.378
Okay...

07:41.378 --> 07:44.422
Um, there's a ton of soda left
if you want some.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.840
No, I'm good.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.551
I think I'm off beverages
for, like, a year.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.470
Yeah, the same.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.971
This morning was gnarly.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.975
That party, though...
it was one of the greats.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.227
Hall of fame level.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.270
(laughs) Good.
I'm glad you had fun.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.147
Luke:
Yeah, big time.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.525
Even if, you know,
some of it was a blur.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.028
The end of the night,
especially.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.281
Hey, it's your party

08:10.281 --> 08:13.118
and you'll black out
if you want to. (laughs)

08:13.118 --> 08:15.870
All right, the house is
officially clean.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.165
I... I should get going anyway.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.252
Uh, I gotta lock up the cabin
before the storm.

08:22.252 --> 08:26.423
Megan, you should, uh,
go and help. Right?

08:26.423 --> 08:29.926
Well, I'm sure Luke
can handle it on his own.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.220
Actually,
it would go a lot faster
with an extra set of hands.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.515
Yeah? Okay.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.226
Great.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.479
Cool.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.490
(door opens)

08:52.490 --> 08:55.368
You have no case against Megan,
no proof she had anything
to do with Luke's death--

08:55.368 --> 08:57.829
This isn't about
the Chambers case.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.832
We found evidence of fraud
linked to Megan's computer.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.168
You may have protected
your files,

09:03.168 --> 09:06.087
but we went in through
the Department of Licensing's
website,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.797
traced the activity
back to your house.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.508
She is being charged
with a misdemeanor
for making fake IDs.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.849
May we have the room?

09:23.688 --> 09:26.733
-I'm gonna lose my scholarship.
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.861
No, there's an "honor" component
to it-- if they find out
I have a record, I'm done.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.947
It's... It's the only way
I can even go to college.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.533
I'll never get enough loans
to make it work otherwise.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.619
There's gotta be something
that you can do, please.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.413
Can't you-- Can't you, like,
appeal it or get it reversed?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.874
No, I'm afraid not.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.418
You reproduced a watermark
from a government website.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.253
You're lucky you were 17
at the time,

09:47.253 --> 09:50.590
otherwise it would be
a felony and jail time.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.348
So that's... that's just it?
It's over?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.434
I'm sorry.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.407
Your dad knows
this is a thunderstorm,

10:16.407 --> 10:18.118
not a class 5 hurricane, right?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.536
He doesn't care.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.912
I mean, you know how it goes--

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
control freaks love preparation.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.250
(laughs) I'm gonna choose
to take that as a compliment.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.709
Okay.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.878
We've brought in the firewood,
turned off the gas.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.338
Now we gotta do the flashlights.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.464
Okay.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.301
Do any of these work?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.137
I don't know.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.305
I'm starting to see why you
get such good grades, though.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.397
Can't remember the last time
that we hung out,

10:47.397 --> 10:49.190
you know, just the two of us?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.651
Yeah. It has been a while.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.736
Before Isabella got here...

10:56.573 --> 10:58.867
You doing okay with all that?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.910
Yeah. Yeah.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.246
I didn't really
see it coming, but, um...

11:03.246 --> 11:05.206
it was probably the right call.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.960
This is cool.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.420
Old school.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.174
Boom.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.341
I'm gonna look for candles.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.639
(laughs)

11:21.639 --> 11:24.225
Oh, hey, sorry. I left my wallet
back at the counter.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.852
-I'll meet you
at the car, though.
-Okay.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.569
(car alarm chirps)

11:37.989 --> 11:39.240
Hey.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.746
This is not a joke.
I thought you got that.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.957
Real, irreversible disaster
is mere hours away.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.876
-I know--
-No, you don't know.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.045
Y2K is not a party,
it's a crisis.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.881
-Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off her!
-Don't you touch me!

11:54.881 --> 11:57.175
Just because you're doing
some computer thing together

11:57.175 --> 11:59.510
does not mean
you can lay hands on her.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.304
Didn't realize
you were her keeper.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.681
Do I need your permission
to talk to her too?

12:03.681 --> 12:06.351
-Screw you.
-You know, you deserve
a lot better than this.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.854
-Both of you, come on--
-Megan is headed for greatness.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.149
You are just a spoiled little
loser that's pulling her--

12:13.149 --> 12:15.026
Megan:
Luke, stop it! What the hell?

12:15.026 --> 12:17.487
Well, you're just
like your father, aren't ya?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.822
You steamroll anything
that gets in your way,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.241
as if the rules
don't apply to you.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.909
Well, you know what?

12:22.909 --> 12:26.955
You are gonna get a very harsh
wake-up call, little Chambers.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.623
And it might just be your last.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.837
(shopping cart clatters)

12:34.837 --> 12:36.381
-What?
-(rear doors slam)

12:38.299 --> 12:39.759
(side door closes)

12:39.759 --> 12:41.010
(engine starts)

12:43.263 --> 12:44.472
(tires squeal)

12:58.444 --> 12:59.904
Getting ready for dorm life?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.739
(laughs) Yeah.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.533
Uh...

13:03.533 --> 13:07.829
My parents are driving me
to USC next week.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.456
We're gonna make
a couple of stops along the way,

13:10.456 --> 13:12.125
make it a real road trip.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.585
That's cool.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.170
What about you?

13:16.170 --> 13:19.173
When do you leave to U Dub?

13:19.173 --> 13:23.344
Um... I'm not sure
that's happening now.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.056
I got charged with a misdemeanor

13:27.056 --> 13:28.891
for the fake IDs.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.476
Pretty sure I'm gonna lose
my scholarship.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.936
Oh, shit.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.771
I'm sorry, Megan.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.154
It's, uh...

13:43.531 --> 13:45.700
it's my fault.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.327
What are you talking about?

13:48.327 --> 13:52.040
I got busted trying to get
a six-pack with my fake.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.793
The sheriff offered me a deal
if I told him who made them.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.962
So you narc'd on me?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.298
And did you tell them
that it was all your idea?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.591
I tried.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.342
For real.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.678
But I couldn't explain to him
how I copied the watermark.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.432
So you gave me up, even though
I kept your secret?

14:09.432 --> 14:11.309
Look, I didn't know
what else to say.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.313
I'm really sorry, Megan.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
Yeah, you said that.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.524
Have fun at college.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.161
Megan: I mean, since when
do you even get in fights?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.121
He was practically
foaming at the mouth, Megan.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.915
I was just trying
to protect you.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.876
I don't need a bodyguard.
He's my friend.
You just made it worse.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.295
I was just--
I was worried about you.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.340
Okay, and maybe I overreacted.
Forgive me.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.926
Yeah. Just...
I don't know... chill.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.096
I've never seen Ned like that.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.098
I knew he was
spinning about Y2K, but...

14:50.098 --> 14:53.267
-(pager beeping)
-...that was a lot.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.897
(sighs)

14:57.897 --> 15:00.525
Great. Tim's parents
came home early.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.360
The party's off.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.695
Maybe it's a sign.
An omen.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.115
No, wait, Megan, look,
it's the end of a century.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.200
We have to do something legit.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.993
Okay, it might rain,
so the cove's off.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.703
And Casa Chambers
is a no-fun zone.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.205
But...

15:14.205 --> 15:15.665
maybe we could have it here?

15:15.665 --> 15:18.417
No, my mom has the flu.
Let's just bail.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.754
Wait, you know the old cannery
down by the water?

15:21.754 --> 15:25.049
My dad just bought it
to turn it into stores.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.759
It's a perfect place
for a party.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.719
Or we could
just forget about it.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.429
I'm not really feeling
that great anyway.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.057
No way, come on.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.434
Look...

15:35.434 --> 15:36.978
I'll figure something out.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.524
I want this to be a night

15:41.524 --> 15:43.568
that we remember
for the rest of our lives.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.328
Yeah, well, that's
a 17-year-old boy for you.
More testosterone than brains.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.539
Isn't it incredible
that any of us live past 21?

15:56.539 --> 15:57.915
(distant thunder rumbling)

15:57.915 --> 15:59.667
No, I appreciate
the heads-up, Mike.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.294
That's...
you did the right thing.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.962
(inhales sharply) Yep.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.922
Okay, bye-bye.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.508
Look, it's Chatham's own
Oscar De La Hoya.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.760
-Dad.
-You know, that's the third call
I've gotten on this thing?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.596
Trying to break a record?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.598
I mean, do you enjoy
making shit storms?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.808
First your little tape
blew up my Northland deal,

16:15.808 --> 16:18.519
now you go around
assaulting the town lunatic.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.733
-Dad, he started it.
-Are you five years old?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.735
You don't go around
hitting people.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.987
I have to say that to you?

16:27.987 --> 16:31.449
Especially not litigious jerks
like Ned Faunce,

16:31.449 --> 16:34.035
whose little war with me
over his property line

16:34.035 --> 16:35.286
is already costing a fortune.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.544
What were you thinking?

16:47.048 --> 16:50.885
You always say being a man means
standing up for what's right.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.888
He was being handsy with Megan,
and I tried to put a stop to it.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.308
Well, good instinct,
lousy execution.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.685
Yeah?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.938
You gotta be smarter.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.023
Look at me.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.818
Your actions have consequences
for this family.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.948
Do you understand that?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.910
Do you understand it?

17:18.871 --> 17:21.040
-I--
-No, that's it.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.542
Haven't you caused
enough damage?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.877
I'll see you at home.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.629
(intense music playing)

17:35.555 --> 17:37.848
I can't find it.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.850
Uh, check under the island.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.984
Bingo.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.277
Whoo!

17:50.403 --> 17:53.531
Great. Now all we have to do
is secure the kayaks

17:53.531 --> 17:54.949
down by the docks
and we're done.

17:54.949 --> 17:55.950
(Megan laughs)

17:58.911 --> 18:00.413
No way.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.039
You kept yours too.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.458
Yeah, of course.
These things are classic.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.210
Dude, these had crazy range.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.462
They worked all the way
to the dock. (laughs)

18:08.462 --> 18:11.132
I mean, how many hours did we
spend out there in the woods

18:11.132 --> 18:12.341
playing secret agent?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.386
Oh, like, a million, at least?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.763
We never did finish
those missions.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.474
No, but we probably walked
every inch of that forest

18:20.474 --> 18:22.226
with these things.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.104
And then you were
still so scared that
you were gonna get lost.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.106
My internal compass is broken.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.775
True, but I would have
found you, I always found you.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.989
(laughs) Wait... do you remember

18:34.989 --> 18:37.283
when we stuck one of
these things under Brent's tent

18:37.283 --> 18:39.827
and then he was convinced
it was an alien invasion?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.912
That was my tent.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.372
It was? No.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.291
-That was my tent.
-No, it was--

18:45.291 --> 18:47.752
Oh, my God, you're right!

18:47.752 --> 18:49.920
You're right, 'cause
me and Brent pranked you!

18:49.920 --> 18:52.048
And then you got so scared
that you literally

18:52.048 --> 18:55.384
ran into the lake
in your pajamas.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.386
Yeah, keep laughing,
keep laughing, real funny.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.263
Just scarred for life,
that's all.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.015
(giggling)

19:06.937 --> 19:10.650
I feel like half my childhood
was spent up here,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.526
just you and me.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.070
The best parts of it, anyway.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.155
(radio beeps, static buzzes)

19:16.155 --> 19:18.449
Hey! Mine still has
some juice left.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.204
Should we finish that mission?

19:26.916 --> 19:30.211
Your dad hired someone
to spy on me?

19:30.211 --> 19:32.588
-That's not the point.
-(sighs)

19:32.588 --> 19:34.507
What the hell are you doing
with Ned Faunce?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.883
It's none of your business.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.968
And Ned never
would have hurt Luke.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.846
It did not seem that way
on New Year's Eve.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.807
I mean, you saw him attack Luke.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.851
Okay, that... that's
not exactly how it went down.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.353
Okay.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.021
Okay, well,
did you know he stole

19:49.021 --> 19:51.065
millions of dollars' worth
of intellectual property

19:51.065 --> 19:52.525
from his last employer?

19:54.777 --> 19:59.740
Or that he assaulted his boss?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.409
He put him in the hospital.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.038
Just, my advice,
stay far away from him.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.585
Look, you're like family,

20:11.585 --> 20:13.546
so I know that you
didn't kill Luke,

20:13.546 --> 20:17.258
but Ned, he's going down, and...

20:19.176 --> 20:20.886
if you're not careful,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.513
he's gonna take you with him.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.610
Dad called me down here.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.155
You might not want to
go in there for, like, a month.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.657
Hmm.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.994
Yep, uh, I've been there,
done that,

20:44.994 --> 20:47.663
got the "You're
a disappointment" shirt.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.041
Look, my advice?

20:51.041 --> 20:54.295
Just keep your head down,
don't argue.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.547
'Cause even if you are right,

20:56.547 --> 21:00.551
you're just gonna dig
yourself a deeper hole. Hmm?

21:00.551 --> 21:03.262
Steve: (in distance)
Yeah, I heard, I know.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.015
I know, but I assure you...

21:06.015 --> 21:07.933
Hey, look, I was gonna...

21:07.933 --> 21:11.103
maybe snake the keys
to the cannery for tonight.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.566
It's quiet down there,
especially this time of year.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.443
Even the sheriffs
are gonna avoid it.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.571
Well, maybe there is hope
for you yet.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.867
Yeah, but if Dad catches me,
I'm dead.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.454
Brent:
Okay.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.914
Then don't get caught.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.002
Seriously, if you do get busted,

21:35.002 --> 21:37.004
I'm will serve you up
on a platter.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.137
Oh, and, uh, happy New Year.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.437
(laughing)

22:23.968 --> 22:25.511
Megan:
Come on!

22:43.946 --> 22:45.239
(sighs)

22:47.992 --> 22:50.578
(suspenseful music playing)

23:06.594 --> 23:08.429
(dance music playing)

23:11.765 --> 23:14.226
(laughs)
You really pulled this off.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.895
This is gonna be fun.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.897
Are you feeling better?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.565
Um, yeah. Yeah, mostly.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.817
Good, I'm glad, I'm glad.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.986
I just want to do
a quick cheers, okay?

23:23.986 --> 23:26.030
-To the new millennium.
-(giggling)

23:26.030 --> 23:27.990
I can't wait to make history
with you tonight.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.956
Whoa. Someone's prepared.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.625
Yeah.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.543
I mean, do you actually think

23:39.543 --> 23:41.670
that something crazy's
gonna happen at midnight?

23:41.670 --> 23:44.965
Hmm, I mean, the banks might
be screwed up for a while

23:44.965 --> 23:47.801
and the sheriff's radio
frequencies might malfunction.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.721
But that means that
we don't have to worry about
the party getting shut down.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.390
Well, if things do
turn to Armageddon, I got you.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.147
All right, party people.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.441
It is three hours till midnight.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.818
Any thoughts or concerns
about Y2K?

24:04.818 --> 24:07.488
I've been holding out
for the right guy, y'know?

24:07.488 --> 24:09.114
But, uh...

24:09.114 --> 24:13.661
if the world ends,
I don't want to die a virgin.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.080
-(giggles)
-Hey, I can, like,
totally help with that.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.331
It would be my civic duty.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.583
Oh, she said "right guy,"
not mouth breather.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.126
(laughter)

24:21.126 --> 24:23.545
I'm afraid of the Robopocalypse.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.173
What's that?

24:26.173 --> 24:28.300
You know, when machines
take over the world?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.594
It's totally coming.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.055
(laughter)

24:33.055 --> 24:34.181
Guys, no.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.183
Why are you laughing?

24:36.183 --> 24:37.851
(laughter continues)

24:42.439 --> 24:44.984
Megan:
This used to seem a lot bigger.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.986
-"That's what she said."
-She said...

24:46.986 --> 24:48.737
You're such a dork.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.365
It did, though, didn't it?

24:51.365 --> 24:54.493
Yeah, it did.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.329
I guess it's like...

24:57.329 --> 25:00.374
I don't know, when you've seen
something a million times

25:00.374 --> 25:02.793
and you know what it is,

25:02.793 --> 25:08.090
and suddenly, one day,
it looks completely different.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.216
You know?

25:11.677 --> 25:12.720
Yeah.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.099
Yeah, it's like,
when you were a kid, and...

25:17.099 --> 25:20.019
you know, something's
gross or seems weird.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.312
But now it's...

25:22.312 --> 25:23.647
now it's awesome.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.318
Right.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.286
Race you to the dock!

25:37.286 --> 25:39.496
-(laughing)
-Are you serious? Megan!

25:39.496 --> 25:41.749
Megan, wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

25:41.749 --> 25:44.376
-Wait!
-Megan: Run!

25:44.376 --> 25:45.919
(dance music playing)

25:52.092 --> 25:54.553
Hey. You've been MIA.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.930
Yeah. Party duty never sleeps.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.142
Here, have my Y2-Kocktail.
In two hours, it'll be obsolete.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.564
Hmm. Not bad.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.900
You're not gonna having any?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.153
Uh, I've already had several.
Just trying to pace myself.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.988
Yeah, don't want to peak
too early.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.615
Megan:
Yeah.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.366
Nice crib.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.118
Major upgrade.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.288
Luke made it happen.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.998
He's a real magician.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.171
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.715
About...?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.425
Yesterday. At the Plunge.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.553
What did Luke say?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.305
That you kissed him.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.140
Last time I checked,
"ride or die"

26:40.140 --> 26:41.934
didn't include
macking on my boyfriend.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.936
Yeah, that never happened.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.771
He kissed me.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.483
Then why wouldn't you
say anything?

26:49.483 --> 26:51.819
I just didn't want to make
things a mess between you two.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.821
What about your loyalty to me?
Having my back?

26:53.821 --> 26:55.572
Did that even cross your mind?

26:55.572 --> 26:59.159
I just figured that he
made a mistake, so I let it go.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.078
But you clearly wouldn't
have believed me anyway.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.914
-That's not true.
-Isn't it?

27:03.914 --> 27:05.749
You always pick his side
over mine.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.209
No, I don't.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.461
You're literally
doing it right now!

27:09.461 --> 27:12.047
Megan, you're supposed
to trust me,

27:12.047 --> 27:13.549
give me the benefit
of the doubt.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.843
But you can't even
do that anymore.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.481
Hey, have you seen Luke?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.149
I think he and the guys
went to get more beer.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.906
I got hit with a misdemeanor

27:37.906 --> 27:40.868
for making those fake IDs
last summer.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.452
That's a bunk charge.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.329
Maybe, but it's
on my record now.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.915
If U Dub finds out about it,
my scholarship's toast.

27:49.293 --> 27:53.589
Do you think that you could
hack into the court's database
and erase it?

27:53.589 --> 27:55.465
I wish I could, but, I mean,

27:55.465 --> 27:57.175
once something
like that's in the system,

27:57.175 --> 27:58.427
there's a paper trail.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.305
-It's too late.
-Damn it.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.349
You were my last hope,
my last chance...

28:04.349 --> 28:07.352
Yeah, but, you know, a diploma's
just a piece of paper.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.480
(laughs) Plenty of famous coders
never even finished college.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.482
I can't count
on being one in a million.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.817
I need a degree.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.570
Only if you insist
on playing by their rules.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.994
Th-The scholarship isn't
the only reason that I'm here.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.163
Um...

28:26.163 --> 28:28.373
Steve Chambers is convinced

28:28.373 --> 28:30.834
that you have something
to do with Luke's death.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.878
(scoffs)

28:32.878 --> 28:34.338
He's investigating you.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.715
Your past.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.342
(Ned groans)

28:38.342 --> 28:44.097
Claims that you stole IP,
that you attacked your boss...

28:44.097 --> 28:46.642
You can't steal
what was yours to begin with!

28:46.642 --> 28:48.393
Oh!

28:57.235 --> 28:58.737
(furniture clatters)

29:01.573 --> 29:04.952
(indistinct chatter)

29:04.952 --> 29:08.038
Yeah, but Megan's been
really chill about the tape.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.749
You know? We're all good.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.918
Eric: I once dated two chicks
at the same time.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.795
Takes mad skill.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.005
Wouldn't think
you had the fire power.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.840
Tim: You know, I've been
ponying up Isabella,

29:18.840 --> 29:21.093
but I can take Megan
for a ride if you want.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.179
Yeah. In your dreams, dude.

29:24.179 --> 29:27.099
Eric: Let me know
when you wanna level up, okay?
I'll give you some tips.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.267
Nah, he's not ready yet.
He's still got
training wheels on.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.352
(laughing)

29:33.230 --> 29:36.566
I can handle
both of them, no problem.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.860
Okay? I got them wrapped
around my finger.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.071
Eric: Better if they're wrapped
around something else.

29:41.071 --> 29:44.783
At the same time.
Ménage-à-Luke, baby. (laughs)

29:44.783 --> 29:47.619
Yeah, you know, I've actually...
I'm teeing it up.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.623
Yeah. I busted a major move
with Isabella after the Plunge.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.041
She couldn't get enough.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.043
Eric: (falsetto)
Ooh, there it is! Okay!

29:55.043 --> 29:56.586
Tim:
That's what we like to hear.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.547
Luke: You saw me
with Isabella on the tape.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.549
I've done it before,
I'll do it again.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.135
Tim: He's growing up so fast,
look at Chambers go!

30:03.135 --> 30:06.304
(Eric and Tim laughing)

30:06.304 --> 30:08.682
Luke: You know, I gotta get
some practice in for college.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.563
(door buzzes, slams)

30:14.563 --> 30:18.483
If Chambers is looking into me,
I'm gonna look into him.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.943
(keying)

30:21.653 --> 30:22.571
(computer chimes)

30:36.209 --> 30:38.003
Have you always
had those cameras?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.546
Looking out towards the road?

30:39.546 --> 30:41.173
Ever since I moved in.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.556
Is that Steve Chambers?
He can't know I'm here.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.184
I'll take care of him.
You slip out the back.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.143
Okay.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.753
Steve: Faunce!

31:19.753 --> 31:20.879
Faunce?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.008
Megan Landry
is a teenage girl.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.135
You had no business
dragging her into your mess.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.346
-It's okay.
-Megan's not your concern.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.848
She is. I wanna know the truth.
I wanna know how it went down.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.267
What, so Luke found out
you were doing something illegal

31:34.267 --> 31:37.062
so you killed him to keep him
quiet, keep him from talking?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.106
-Get the hell off my property!
-Come on, Dad.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.359
Hold it, it's okay. It's okay.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.986
I know you had something
to do with the death of my son,

31:44.986 --> 31:46.446
and I'm going to prove it.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.949
Ned:
Go ahead and try.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.326
Yeah, every time
you turn around,

31:51.326 --> 31:53.662
I'm gonna be watching,
I'm gonna be waiting.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.164
I'm gonna be waiting
for you to screw up,

31:56.164 --> 31:58.667
because I know you will.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.585
Take your threats, and your kid,

32:00.585 --> 32:03.672
and get the hell out of here
before it gets ugly!

32:05.590 --> 32:07.342
Brent:
Dad, come on.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.802
Don't touch me!

32:12.973 --> 32:14.182
You're not gonna do anything.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.110
Luke:
Hey, where'd you go?

32:25.110 --> 32:28.238
-I took the shortcut.
-Okay, that
might've been cool

32:28.238 --> 32:30.157
when the Morgans lived there,
but, careful,

32:30.157 --> 32:31.658
Ned's like the Unabomber.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.786
Chillax. I know the code
to use if I need to abort.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.747
-But I'll keep my eyes
peeled for any landmines.
-Okay.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.125
I don't wanna be the one
that has to explain to Jeff
why you lost a leg.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.173
You there?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.759
Actually, um...

32:49.759 --> 32:51.428
Jeff and I aren't
together anymore.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.345
(static buzzing)

32:53.972 --> 32:55.765
Uh, what do you mean?

32:55.765 --> 32:58.852
You're not the only one
who got dumped this week.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.187
I joined the club last night.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.356
Seriously?

33:03.356 --> 33:05.734
You know how competitive I am.
Didn't want you to be alone.

33:07.444 --> 33:08.653
Are you okay?

33:08.653 --> 33:10.655
Yeah.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.532
I mean, at first
it kind of sucked, but...

33:12.532 --> 33:13.742
I'm okay now.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.384

33:31.384 --> 33:32.844

a different frequency.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.016
There's more than one?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.359
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?
I got turned around.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.486
I didn't realize
that I was on your land.

33:49.486 --> 33:53.490
I value my privacy,
and I don't appreciate anyone
trespassing on my property.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.761
Per school policy,
I was required

37:42.761 --> 37:46.139
to inform
the University of Washington.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.725
I'm afraid they're going
to have to rescind
your scholarship.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.936
I'm so sorry.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.732
Megan?

37:57.859 --> 37:58.985
Megan, are you there?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.030
Megan?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.493
You sure you don't need me
to come find you?

38:07.869 --> 38:09.913
No, I figured it out.

38:09.913 --> 38:10.872
(static buzzes)

38:13.833 --> 38:17.462
I just, uh... I got a little
distracted for a minute.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.507
(laughs) Story of your life.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.259
(Luke laughs, sighs)

38:27.764 --> 38:29.098
(Megan giggling)

38:29.098 --> 38:31.893
When did we carve these?

38:31.893 --> 38:34.479
When we were, like,
I don't know, 11?

38:34.479 --> 38:36.689
-Yeah.
-I don't know, I remember
I cut my hand on it.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.149
I still got the scar from it.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.110
Megan:
Ooh. Ouch.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.238
(Counting Crows
playing "Colorblind")

38:57.961 --> 38:59.504
Those were the best times
in my life, too.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.009
Other things
were lousy or great.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.970
You were always there.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.680
Yeah, you too.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.226
I can't even picture
a world without you in it.

39:13.226 --> 39:16.604
Even if I could, I...

39:16.604 --> 39:18.690
I don't think
I would want to hang there.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.733
Smart man.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.402
It would be super lame.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.658
Luke:
Um...

39:31.202 --> 39:35.081
I remember
what happened last night.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.916
What... what almost happened.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.919
It was a crazy night. (laughs)

39:39.919 --> 39:42.672
Everybody had
way too much to drink.

39:42.672 --> 39:46.593
They were all
acting like idiots.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.345
No.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.681
I was being an idiot.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.189
You ever wish you could
go back, just undo something?

40:00.189 --> 40:02.400
Hmm. Yeah.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.943
Control-alt-delete.

40:03.943 --> 40:08.531
♪ Pull me out from inside... ♪

40:13.244 --> 40:15.496
Uh, look, I know that--

40:15.496 --> 40:19.584

40:19.584 --> 40:24.672

40:40.480 --> 40:43.232

40:43.232 --> 40:46.319
Hey! Hey, it's starting.
Come on.

40:49.656 --> 40:50.990
Everyone, everyone, it's time!

40:50.990 --> 40:53.159
-(music stops)
-Okay, okay!

40:53.159 --> 40:54.827
Here we go! Ready?

40:54.827 --> 40:57.372
all:
10, 9,

40:57.372 --> 40:59.540
8, 7,

40:59.540 --> 41:02.877
6, 5, 4,

41:02.877 --> 41:05.838
3, 2, 1...

41:05.838 --> 41:07.674
all:
Happy New Year!

41:07.674 --> 41:10.051
Whooo!

41:10.051 --> 41:11.219
Happy New Year!

41:20.478 --> 41:22.897
Why don't we go back
to the cabin and celebrate?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.816
Just the two of us. Hmm?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.651
Yeah, let's go.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.612
(intense music playing)

41:29.612 --> 41:31.406
(cheering, toy horns blowing)

41:35.660 --> 41:37.412
(theme song playing)
