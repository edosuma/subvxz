Subtitles by explosiveskull

03:59.347 --> 04:01.224
Did it happen again?

04:02.391 --> 04:03.934
Yeah.

04:11.109 --> 04:12.152
I'm worried about you.

04:20.368 --> 04:21.243
Hi baby.

04:23.537 --> 04:24.913
I'll go make the coffee.

05:55.296 --> 05:56.380
I wouldn't show her.

05:57.339 --> 06:00.510
Looks like an owl got it,
maybe a dog.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.095
I don't think there are
coyotes around here but.

06:05.097 --> 06:07.347
Thank you.
I might not mention it.

06:07.349 --> 06:09.267
The cat's been gone a week.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.518
She's already accepted
it ran away

06:11.520 --> 06:13.939
and this would just
upset her all over again.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.941
Mommy.

06:17.943 --> 06:18.861
Hi baby.

06:19.529 --> 06:20.402
What was it?

06:20.404 --> 06:23.491
It's nothing,
it's just a dead bird.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.910
Do you want me to bury it?

06:28.912 --> 06:30.496
No thanks,
I'm gonna Robert take

06:30.498 --> 06:32.205
care of it when he gets home.

06:32.207 --> 06:33.915
You sure? it's no problem.

06:33.917 --> 06:35.085
No but thank you.

06:37.046 --> 06:39.089
Well, lawn looks great as usual.

06:40.215 --> 06:41.049
Thank you.

06:42.051 --> 06:45.385
If you know anyone that
might need our services

06:45.387 --> 06:47.429
I'd really appreciate
the referral.

06:47.431 --> 06:48.681
I live just a few
streets down now

06:48.683 --> 06:51.060
and I like to work close
to home if possible.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.729
Sure I'll keep you in mind.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.354
Have a good day.

06:56.356 --> 06:57.232
You too.

07:10.037 --> 07:11.244
We've been in this
house over a month

07:11.246 --> 07:13.290
and we still have a
ton of boxes to open.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.751
Well, apparently
whatever's in those

07:16.753 --> 07:19.087
boxes isn't that important.

07:20.757 --> 07:21.591
Really?

07:24.260 --> 07:25.178
Like you're razor.

07:27.222 --> 07:28.138
Like your razor.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.978
Promise me we'll
finish this weekend.

07:35.604 --> 07:37.564
Okay promise.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.318
No gardening.

07:41.611 --> 07:42.445
Okay.

07:44.322 --> 07:47.283
So why did you start a
garden when we just moved in?

07:49.493 --> 07:51.410
It's the right season.

07:51.412 --> 07:52.496
We can unpack any time.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.209
Besides if I didn't I'd
have to wait till next year.

07:57.794 --> 08:00.335
We just moved in. I
think that automatically

08:00.337 --> 08:02.297
makes it the
season for unpacking.

08:05.008 --> 08:10.013
Babe, I've been clean for
two years okay, it helps.

08:12.474 --> 08:14.140
I'll lay off some I'll
get this done

08:14.142 --> 08:16.395
I'm just not gonna stop
completely okay.

08:24.445 --> 08:26.571
It's bedtime for
little man though.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.489
I'll get him ready for bed.

08:28.491 --> 08:29.659
You have to read to him.

08:33.328 --> 08:35.664
Dunock,
then the queen said

08:37.167 --> 08:40.169
then Rumpelstiltskin must be
your name.

08:41.169 --> 08:45.047
And at that the little
man flew into such a rage

08:45.049 --> 08:48.383
that he said curses
and he stamped his feet

08:48.385 --> 08:51.553
so hard that he
fell through the floor

08:51.555 --> 08:56.518
and disappeared forever,
the end.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.687
What do you think bud?

08:59.688 --> 09:01.064
Ready for bed little man?

09:02.232 --> 09:03.400
Yeah come on.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.912
Is my daughter here?

09:16.914 --> 09:17.789
Nope.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.669
Well I brought some things
over for your little house.

09:24.713 --> 09:26.340
Well she's gone for a while.

09:28.342 --> 09:29.383
I'll just leave them.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.219
I can give them to her.

09:31.221 --> 09:32.096
Okay.

09:33.932 --> 09:34.765
Thanks.

09:37.684 --> 09:38.560
Okay then.

09:51.366 --> 09:52.239
Thanks.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.284
No problem,
I'm enjoying the view.

09:57.413 --> 10:00.915
You know the view's
pretty nice for up here too.

10:00.917 --> 10:01.793
Hey.

10:10.134 --> 10:12.634
There's a box up here.

10:12.636 --> 10:14.427
What is it?

10:14.429 --> 10:15.265
I don't know.

10:16.765 --> 10:19.141
Maybe somebody must have
left something behind.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.584
What is that?

10:44.586 --> 10:45.794
I don't know.

10:48.047 --> 10:48.882
Looks old.

10:58.473 --> 11:03.478
Open it.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.522
What is that ashes?

11:06.524 --> 11:07.609
Eww.

11:10.028 --> 11:10.904
Weird.

11:14.365 --> 11:15.325
It's a candle holder.

11:24.708 --> 11:25.584
And ropes.

11:32.717 --> 11:34.593
The Inuit burden.

11:38.847 --> 11:40.848
Looks like it's super old.

11:40.850 --> 11:41.806
Is there a date on it?

11:41.808 --> 11:42.684
No.

11:45.521 --> 11:48.232
We do not believe, we fear.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.693
What were these people into?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.368
It started with the flies.

11:59.535 --> 12:01.203
I accidentally swallowed one.

12:02.704 --> 12:06.331
It'd been feeding upon the
body of the local blacksmith.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.375
He was victim of a
creature most foul

12:08.377 --> 12:10.878
and I tremble at the thought
of mentioning it's name.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.215
I must you see.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.592
The very fate of our
village depends upon it.

12:16.593 --> 12:20.222
It possesses the unwary
weak souls who fear death.

12:21.015 --> 12:24.808
The ones like myself
who must go on living

12:24.810 --> 12:28.772
even after everything he
holds dear has been consumed.

12:30.942 --> 12:32.859
The foul creature is none
other than

12:32.861 --> 12:36.403
the cursed one who is
reading these damned pages.

12:39.409 --> 12:40.284
Okay.

12:42.578 --> 12:46.580
Mom knows a dealer,
maybe it's worth something.

12:46.582 --> 12:48.874
Whatever, let's just
get rid of it.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.459
This thing gives me the creeps.

12:50.461 --> 12:51.754
Yeah just put it back in.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.685
Are you coming to bed?

13:08.645 --> 13:13.067
Yeah I'll be there in a
minute, this is almost over.

13:17.739 --> 13:19.741
I promise give me a sec.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.162
Tony.

14:48.203 --> 14:49.037
Tony.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.082
Tony.

14:55.377 --> 14:57.043
It's falling down,
watch out, yeah.

14:57.045 --> 14:57.921
Okay.

15:27.284 --> 15:29.201
Are you okay?

15:34.292 --> 15:35.168
No no.

15:37.462 --> 15:39.087
Call an ambulance.

16:05.448 --> 16:08.409
So Mom said I could work at
her shop, help out a little.

16:09.327 --> 16:11.118
We don't
need her charity.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.869
It's not charity.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.287
She said she needed the help and

16:14.289 --> 16:15.958
she was gonna hire
someone anyway.

16:24.132 --> 16:27.970
We just bought this
house, we can't lose it.

16:32.433 --> 16:33.308
We'll be fine.

16:35.477 --> 16:38.271
The doctor said you'll be back
on your feet in eight weeks.

16:38.273 --> 16:41.023
Between the money from the
shop and the money from Tony.

16:41.025 --> 16:43.443
I'm gonna have to hire help.

16:45.196 --> 16:47.654
And then there's gonna be
nothing left.

16:47.656 --> 16:50.534
Well then sit down
let it heal.

16:52.202 --> 16:54.412
I don't want,

16:54.414 --> 16:56.540
I don't want to sit okay.

17:03.005 --> 17:04.339
I'm gonna work in the garden.

17:19.563 --> 17:20.439
Idiot.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.543
Oh my God shut up.

17:44.505 --> 17:47.342
Get out of here,
get out of here.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.246
Hey buddy.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.087
What are you playing with?

19:14.803 --> 19:17.640
Come on let's have
some breakfast.

19:23.646 --> 19:24.603
What's over there?

19:27.691 --> 19:28.567
Caleb?

19:58.805 --> 20:00.516
I take a bite,
you take a bite.

20:05.688 --> 20:06.773
So how was your day?

20:07.857 --> 20:08.733
It was alright.

20:12.903 --> 20:14.446
She driving you crazy yet?

20:16.740 --> 20:19.785
She's just, she's Mom.

20:25.041 --> 20:28.917
Oh thanks for making dinner,
it's good.

20:28.919 --> 20:31.630
Yeah, thanks.
I added the mushrooms

20:33.048 --> 20:36.716
and maybe a little
too much garlic?

20:36.718 --> 20:38.888
So I smell but it's good.

20:42.851 --> 20:45.436
Oh, grab the camera.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.025
Say cheese.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.408
That's one
for the scrapbook.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.118
You know, what let's
get you cleaned up.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.712
Oh wow, how did that
get on his head?

21:13.255 --> 21:15.089
How are you two doing?

21:15.091 --> 21:17.675
You getting along like
a couple old pals?

21:17.677 --> 21:20.011
Oh yeah, he's great.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.890
Yeah pretty awesome
little man here.

21:23.932 --> 21:26.852
He'll just play by
himself for hours.

21:28.228 --> 21:29.438
That's good.

21:30.648 --> 21:32.442
He's getting some
good daddy time.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.159
Have you ever seen
him talking himself?

21:43.953 --> 21:44.787
What do you mean?

21:47.790 --> 21:50.707
I don't know, playing
by himself sometimes

21:50.709 --> 21:53.587
and it's like he's with someone.

21:54.630 --> 21:56.966
Like an imaginary friend?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.094
Yeah.

22:03.598 --> 22:06.515
Yeah he's probably got
an imaginary friend.

22:06.517 --> 22:07.559
That's cute.

22:11.523 --> 22:13.814
So you
haven't seen him do it?

22:13.816 --> 22:16.108
No, I mean I've
heard him mumble

22:16.110 --> 22:19.823
to himself but
nothing like that.

22:27.330 --> 22:29.999
I've just never
seen a kid do that before.

22:40.927 --> 22:44.639
Honey, sorry didn't
mean to scare you.

22:45.723 --> 22:46.850
Are you coming to bed?

22:48.685 --> 22:50.141
I'm not tired.

22:50.143 --> 22:52.229
Yes you are, go to bed.

22:55.150 --> 22:56.025
In a minute.

22:58.194 --> 22:59.028
What is it?

23:01.906 --> 23:02.782
What's what?

23:05.368 --> 23:06.870
Nothing.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.669
Goodnight.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.749
I'm sorry, thought I
saw something.

23:54.249 --> 23:55.667
You saw what?

24:00.255 --> 24:01.090
Nothing.

24:47.887 --> 24:48.927
What the hell?

25:05.487 --> 25:07.739
You want your bone back
you little bastard?

25:38.062 --> 25:40.061
Hi neighbor what can
I do you for?

25:40.063 --> 25:42.358
Your dog is digging up
my garden.

25:45.486 --> 25:47.029
Just keep him out of my yard.

25:48.948 --> 25:49.823
Sorry.

26:26.861 --> 26:27.736
Hello.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.032
Hey baby.

26:33.075 --> 26:34.908
Hey.

26:34.910 --> 26:36.994
Hey how was your day?

26:36.996 --> 26:39.457
It was, it was fine.

26:40.582 --> 26:42.124
How was yours?

26:42.126 --> 26:44.377
It was alright,
I'm just tired.

26:44.379 --> 26:46.294
What are you making?

26:46.296 --> 26:47.756
It's new.

26:49.092 --> 26:51.801
Beefy mac and cheese.

26:51.803 --> 26:53.470
Well it doesn't sound
too terrible.

26:55.890 --> 26:58.057
I'm gonna kill that dog.

26:58.059 --> 27:00.935
I know he barks
all night long.

27:00.937 --> 27:02.436
And he's been getting
in the yard.

27:02.438 --> 27:04.399
He dug up the garden,
I found a bone.

27:05.315 --> 27:08.902
So I graciously returned
it to its owner.

27:10.405 --> 27:12.280
You returned it to the dog?

27:12.282 --> 27:13.533
No the old man.

27:15.075 --> 27:16.199
We've been here one month

27:16.201 --> 27:17.159
and you're already
making enemies.

27:17.161 --> 27:18.452
Hey I'm not in the wrong here.

27:18.454 --> 27:20.163
It's not about being wrong.

27:20.165 --> 27:22.080
It's about getting
along with our neighbors

27:22.082 --> 27:24.417
not getting angry
at the drop of a hat.

27:24.419 --> 27:26.627
You know what if we
can't pay our mortgage

27:26.629 --> 27:28.879
he's not gonna be a neighbor
that much longer anyway so.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.006
Then don't worry about
the dog and the damn garden

27:31.008 --> 27:33.051
since it's all gonna belong to
bank soon.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.431
We missed one month,
we'll make next month.

27:38.515 --> 27:40.933
We have to double up
on payments

27:40.935 --> 27:42.350
or it will still be
considered late.

27:42.352 --> 27:45.312
We have to send both
payments plus late fees.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.482
I'll call the bank
I'll try to explain.

27:47.484 --> 27:49.065
Well have to borrow
some from Mom.

27:49.067 --> 27:49.943
No.

27:51.487 --> 27:52.988
I'd rather sell my soul.

27:54.157 --> 27:54.988
Then what do we do?

27:54.990 --> 27:56.240
I don't know.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.241
Maybe we shouldn't have spent
all our money on this house.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.659
We needed the money
for the down payment.

27:59.661 --> 28:01.997
You needed the money.

28:03.332 --> 28:04.999
We never should've
gotten a mortgage

28:05.001 --> 28:07.167
without a dime left in savings.

28:07.169 --> 28:08.084
You should have said
something.

28:08.086 --> 28:08.962
I did!

28:10.881 --> 28:12.340
But you just had to have
this house didn't you?

28:12.342 --> 28:13.340
Hey you could
have said no.

28:13.342 --> 28:15.551
I seem to remember two
signatures at closing.

28:15.553 --> 28:17.388
No you know what I couldn't.

28:18.890 --> 28:21.266
You're my wife I want to make
you happy.

28:23.061 --> 28:26.022
Plus if I did say no I'd
still be hearing about it

28:27.023 --> 28:27.855
because you don't give up until

28:27.857 --> 28:30.151
you get your precious
little way.

28:32.027 --> 28:32.945
Screw you.

28:34.906 --> 28:36.196
Fuck you.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.325
Don't cuss in front of Caleb.

29:57.155 --> 29:58.114
What the?

29:58.948 --> 30:00.033
What is it?

30:01.074 --> 30:03.826
There's
something in here.

30:03.828 --> 30:05.453
What's in here?

30:05.455 --> 30:07.788
I don't know a mouse?

30:07.790 --> 30:09.916
Right over here.

30:20.762 --> 30:21.886
You're drunk.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.971
Go to bed before
you kill someone.

30:23.973 --> 30:25.725
It was in here the other day.

30:27.476 --> 30:28.935
I don't think it was a mouse.

30:28.937 --> 30:30.520
I'm too tired for this.

30:30.522 --> 30:31.771
Caleb was up all night.

30:31.773 --> 30:33.898
I have to wake up
in a few hours.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.860
You want to go chase
rodents go outside.

30:39.948 --> 30:40.823
Could have sworn.

31:23.824 --> 31:25.992
What are you doing?

31:25.994 --> 31:28.910
What's all that sound
about you want to get up?

31:28.912 --> 31:30.789
Yeah come on, oh yeah.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.082
You okay now?

31:34.084 --> 31:35.377
Yeah alright.

32:07.201 --> 32:09.661
So what was you so mad about?

32:58.544 --> 33:00.796
Alright, come on you hungry?

33:04.801 --> 33:06.803
Get some grilled cheese.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.133
I'll get that sir.

35:11.135 --> 35:12.262
Sir it's okay.

35:14.347 --> 35:15.932
Right I'm sorry.

35:24.691 --> 35:26.359
Your total is 34.51.

35:28.360 --> 35:32.281
Okay then I'll take,
sorry I don't need this.

35:42.791 --> 35:43.625
32.20?

35:45.669 --> 35:46.961
Or this.

35:48.131 --> 35:49.963
29.76.

35:49.965 --> 35:51.008
Okay great.

35:54.803 --> 35:57.095
You know sir most
people are on food stamps.

35:57.097 --> 35:59.724
I mean don't you have a kid?

35:59.726 --> 36:02.644
A lot of our customers
are on them.

36:05.981 --> 36:07.691
I'm not most customer okay.

36:09.151 --> 36:12.736
I'm just going through a
little bit of a rough patch.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.780
Which is something little girls

36:14.782 --> 36:18.158
in high school don't know
anything about.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.327
I mean all you care about
is a zit on your nose

36:20.329 --> 36:21.162
or what you're gonna
wear tomorrow

36:21.164 --> 36:25.293
or if a cute boy doesn't
notice you.

36:26.836 --> 36:31.633
I have a zit on my nose?

36:40.015 --> 36:43.142
Thus he roamed about
in misery for some years.

36:43.144 --> 36:46.354
Two of her tears wetted his
eyes and they grew clear again

36:46.356 --> 36:49.273
and he could see with
him as before.

36:49.275 --> 36:53.068
He led her to his kingdom
where he was joyfully received

36:53.070 --> 36:55.488
and they lived for a long
time afterwards

36:55.490 --> 36:57.992
happy and contented, the end.

37:02.372 --> 37:03.537
What?

37:03.539 --> 37:04.916
Yeah come here.

37:06.251 --> 37:09.254
Yes okay there we go oh yes.

37:11.798 --> 37:12.756
You go night night?

37:13.465 --> 37:15.467
You want to go in there?

37:20.472 --> 37:23.016
You're okay, look right here.

37:24.519 --> 37:26.142
How about that right there?

37:26.144 --> 37:27.896
Yeah right there okay.

37:30.483 --> 37:35.153
Yeah I give you kiss
okay night night baby.

37:35.155 --> 37:37.740
Okay night night, night night.

37:58.302 --> 37:59.761
Is your leg getting better?

38:01.430 --> 38:02.264
I don't know.

38:05.559 --> 38:09.354
Doctor said eight weeks,
you're over halfway there.

38:10.814 --> 38:11.858
Is it any better?

38:13.860 --> 38:16.195
Still hurts a lot.

38:18.447 --> 38:19.321
You're putting too much
pressure on it.

38:19.323 --> 38:20.990
No I'm not.

38:20.992 --> 38:21.993
You'll wake Caleb.

38:23.869 --> 38:27.372
I'm not, I use
the damn crutch all the time.

38:31.418 --> 38:33.544
You should've gone to your
checkup.

38:33.546 --> 38:35.340
Babe we don't have any money.

38:36.965 --> 38:38.298
Besides what's he gonna do?

38:38.300 --> 38:39.552
He's gonna tell me
to stay off it.

38:40.427 --> 38:42.054
We don't have to pay it
now he can just bill us.

38:44.139 --> 38:46.057
How does billing us help?

38:46.059 --> 38:47.475
We still have to pay.

38:47.477 --> 38:49.270
But we don't do
pay it right now.

38:53.191 --> 38:54.398
You need to take it easy.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.320
Like now there's no reason
why you should be standing up.

38:58.905 --> 38:59.988
You hear that?

39:03.867 --> 39:05.160
Little bastard's still
out there.

39:06.454 --> 39:07.662
Get out.

39:07.664 --> 39:09.582
Don't go out there
you need to sit.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.629
Where are you,
you little bastard?

39:16.631 --> 39:18.463
Stop there's no reason for
you to be chasing that dog.

39:18.465 --> 39:20.425
He is tearing up my garden.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.301
You are going to hurt
yourself.

39:23.303 --> 39:24.805
I'll take care of this,
just go inside.

39:27.517 --> 39:28.685
Where are you you little shit?

39:30.269 --> 39:31.813
He was right here.

39:33.356 --> 39:34.607
Now will you go sit down?

39:36.608 --> 39:38.233
Did you see him?

39:38.235 --> 39:39.234
I saw him right there.

39:39.236 --> 39:41.488
He probably slipped
underneath the fence.

39:42.490 --> 39:44.909
Now go inside and sit down.

39:46.369 --> 39:48.452
It was probably a possum
or a squirrel anyway.

39:53.709 --> 39:55.709
I could have sworn.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.749
You have to bury
shit in my yard.

40:43.968 --> 40:44.844
Come here.

40:56.064 --> 40:58.021
What can I do for you?

40:58.023 --> 41:01.526
Keep your damn dog
out of my yard.

41:01.528 --> 41:02.693
My dog hasn't
been in your yard.

41:02.695 --> 41:05.363
Yes he has I saw
him the other night.

41:05.365 --> 41:06.405
He is ruining my garden.

41:06.407 --> 41:08.323
We keep in before 10 at night.

41:08.325 --> 41:10.952
I don't care what time it was.

41:10.954 --> 41:12.954
The point is he's doing it.

41:12.956 --> 41:15.832
No he's not.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.707
What do you call this then?

41:17.709 --> 41:18.542
A bone.

41:18.544 --> 41:21.504
Yeah and what
else but your dog

41:21.506 --> 41:23.713
would be digging up my
garden and burying bones?

41:23.715 --> 41:25.801
No one else in the neighborhood
has a dog.

41:26.635 --> 41:27.468
I don't know what's getting

41:27.470 --> 41:28.718
back there but it's not my dog.

41:28.720 --> 41:34.015
Yes it is and if you don't
do something about it I will.

41:34.017 --> 41:35.352
Sounds like a threat.

41:37.479 --> 41:38.814
Take it however you want.

41:40.066 --> 41:41.606
We never gave him bones.

41:41.608 --> 41:43.819
My late wife was
always afraid he'd choke.

41:54.664 --> 41:55.582
You alright?

41:59.751 --> 42:01.795
Do you need anything?

42:02.796 --> 42:03.840
I'll be fine.

42:36.164 --> 42:37.040
Yes.

42:47.467 --> 42:48.718
Give me some good news.

42:53.932 --> 42:54.807
Yes.

42:56.517 --> 42:58.686
I got you you little bastard.

43:05.568 --> 43:07.821
Dumb ass, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

43:08.863 --> 43:11.448
Okay I'm sorry.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.075
Didn't hear you come in.

43:15.077 --> 43:18.537
Caught a mouse, told you
there was one in here.

43:18.539 --> 43:20.874
Yeah man slays the beast.

43:22.836 --> 43:25.086
Decent person would
be I don't know?

43:25.088 --> 43:26.086
Thankful maybe.

43:26.088 --> 43:28.674
I'll be thankful if
you throw it outside.

43:34.889 --> 43:37.097
Okay what the hell?

43:37.099 --> 43:39.101
Well I slayed the beast.

43:40.894 --> 43:42.688
Why don't you clean
it and cook it?

43:45.691 --> 43:46.985
Son of a bitch.

43:47.985 --> 43:48.944
Mom was right.

43:49.945 --> 43:50.779
What'd she say?

43:52.948 --> 43:57.619
What did, what did
that bitch say?

44:03.668 --> 44:05.794
She said I shouldn't have
married you.

44:07.296 --> 44:08.463
Is she right?

44:14.803 --> 44:16.014
I don't know.

44:20.517 --> 44:22.017
You know what?

44:22.019 --> 44:22.896
No.

44:24.814 --> 44:27.484
Alright I will not tolerate

44:28.233 --> 44:30.486
someone trying to tear this
family apart.

44:31.278 --> 44:33.155
We've got enough
problems on her own.

44:37.660 --> 44:39.496
Yeah if that's all
she cares about

44:44.166 --> 44:45.832
she can find somebody else
to work in her damn shop.

44:45.834 --> 44:47.667
No don't call her.

44:47.669 --> 44:50.173
I need that job,
we need this job.

44:53.092 --> 44:54.635
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

45:39.847 --> 45:41.557
Oh my gosh.

46:00.742 --> 46:02.785
Saw him outside
the kitchen window.

46:02.787 --> 46:04.704
You animal.

46:04.706 --> 46:05.954
What?

46:05.956 --> 46:07.708
You killed
him you bastard.

46:08.959 --> 46:10.169
Sir I didn't kill your dog.

46:12.671 --> 46:15.756
He probably got hit by a car
tried to drag himself home.

46:15.758 --> 46:17.966
When you let your
dog out this happens.

46:17.968 --> 46:19.637
Please calm down.

46:20.722 --> 46:22.307
Something got to him.

46:24.267 --> 46:25.602
Don't touch him.

46:28.229 --> 46:30.689
Maybe it was coyotes.

46:33.985 --> 46:35.901
He was attacked right here.

46:35.903 --> 46:37.197
You had to cross the fence.

46:38.238 --> 46:40.617
Didn't stand a chance
over whatever got him.

46:41.992 --> 46:42.992
Whatever it was it
must have been

46:42.994 --> 46:45.622
the thing that's been
digging up the garden.

46:49.791 --> 46:51.251
You have blood on your hands.

46:53.963 --> 46:55.215
It's all over the fence.

46:59.885 --> 47:01.176
I have to go to work.

47:01.178 --> 47:02.305
Don't let Caleb see it.

47:04.932 --> 47:06.892
Sir I'm so sorry.

47:26.871 --> 47:27.747
Shit.

47:37.256 --> 47:38.131
Screw it.

47:52.896 --> 47:53.773
Shit.

48:28.390 --> 48:29.474
What's wrong?

48:31.394 --> 48:36.064
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on let me see.

48:38.276 --> 48:39.152
Okay.

48:48.827 --> 48:51.038
Okay, okay okay okay buddy.

48:53.957 --> 48:56.376
Sit right here for me alright.

48:59.506 --> 49:00.381
Hey listen

49:03.092 --> 49:05.302
don't be alarmed but

49:08.055 --> 49:09.847
how do you get bloodstains out?

49:09.849 --> 49:10.972
What happened?

49:10.974 --> 49:14.267
No no no no nothing just
I had another bloody nose.

49:14.269 --> 49:16.188
And I got some on Caleb's shirt.

49:17.106 --> 49:18.314
Are you still bleeding?

49:18.316 --> 49:19.356
Yeah now it's fine,
I stopped it.

49:19.358 --> 49:21.024
Let me ask Mom.

49:21.026 --> 49:22.778
No, please don't ask your Mom.

49:23.530 --> 49:25.490
No Mom everything's
fine it's just a nose bleed.

49:26.825 --> 49:28.825
Work the detergent directly on
the blood.

49:28.827 --> 49:31.910
After about 30 minutes rinse
under water.

49:31.912 --> 49:35.416
Detergent, 30 minutes, cold
water good.

49:43.967 --> 49:44.843
I gotta go.

49:46.052 --> 49:46.968
What's wrong?

49:46.970 --> 49:49.347
Nothing, Caleb spilled
something.

49:50.430 --> 49:53.309
- Alright see you then.
- Okay bye.

50:00.316 --> 50:03.194
What's with these scratches,
buddy?

50:44.360 --> 50:45.236
Yeah.

50:58.124 --> 50:59.082
Damn mice.

52:52.822 --> 52:55.200
Hey baby, okay yeah yeah.

53:02.122 --> 53:02.999
Hey.

53:06.503 --> 53:07.378
Hey.

53:09.213 --> 53:10.506
What time is it?

53:11.173 --> 53:12.550
Have you even started dinner?

53:14.718 --> 53:17.512
No I guess
I fell asleep.

53:17.514 --> 53:19.012
Yeah I see that.

53:19.014 --> 53:19.972
If I'm the one working

53:19.974 --> 53:20.972
don't make me come
home and make dinner.

53:20.974 --> 53:21.851
Don't start.

53:22.644 --> 53:25.811
You know I fell asleep,
it happens.

53:25.813 --> 53:28.523
It's been happening
a lot lately.

53:28.525 --> 53:29.481
Okay you know what?

53:29.483 --> 53:32.693
You nag me to stay off
my leg and when I do

53:32.695 --> 53:33.903
you just keep on nagging?

53:33.905 --> 53:36.405
Because you're on it for
the things that you want to do

53:36.407 --> 53:38.157
but when things need to be
done you suddenly need your...

53:38.159 --> 53:39.700
You know what I'm
getting up okay.

53:39.702 --> 53:44.830
Why don't you just sit
down, rest your weary feet

53:44.832 --> 53:47.791
and shut the hell up?

53:47.793 --> 53:48.669
Asshole.

53:50.921 --> 53:52.631
Don't curse in front of Caleb.

53:53.675 --> 53:54.551
F you.

54:05.561 --> 54:09.062
Yes, okay, let's
take our shirt off.

54:09.064 --> 54:11.066
Take our shirt off okay.

54:17.030 --> 54:20.701
Yeah take our shirt off all the
way okay.

54:31.838 --> 54:35.800
Caleb honey what happened to
your back?

54:50.648 --> 54:51.774
Come on let's go.

55:02.117 --> 55:03.660
What did you do to him?

55:06.079 --> 55:08.289
Yeah I was gonna mention that.

55:08.291 --> 55:10.291
What did you do to him?

55:10.293 --> 55:13.086
I didn't, he woke up like
that I didn't do anything.

55:14.671 --> 55:15.756
I can't do this.

55:16.715 --> 55:19.050
Look I don't
know what happened.

55:19.052 --> 55:20.510
I think something in his crib.

55:20.512 --> 55:21.470
I can't do this.

55:33.816 --> 55:37.234
There, there was
a screw in his crib

55:37.236 --> 55:38.568
and I think maybe that's what...

55:38.570 --> 55:40.656
There's no screw just stop.

55:41.907 --> 55:42.784
It's over.

55:46.829 --> 55:49.081
Everything's over,
I can't do this.

55:50.332 --> 55:51.499
Please.

55:51.501 --> 55:52.377
I can't.

56:06.682 --> 56:08.267
I'm sorry buddy.

57:14.334 --> 57:15.251
Hey man what's up?

57:16.418 --> 57:18.879
Hey we're headed
over to the magazine house.

57:20.256 --> 57:23.259
Good, how's the new guy
working out?

57:24.552 --> 57:25.845
He's working out fine.

57:27.305 --> 57:29.430
Hey listen Mrs. Jackson called

57:29.432 --> 57:31.599
said you'd come by last week.

57:31.601 --> 57:32.602
Oh yeah.

57:33.686 --> 57:35.352
Hey listen I totally forgot.

57:35.354 --> 57:36.354
We'll stop by there next.

57:36.356 --> 57:38.858
Yeah do that she's a
great customer you know.

57:40.401 --> 57:42.611
Are you better,
you coming back soon?

57:44.738 --> 57:45.615
No man.

57:47.784 --> 57:50.619
Damn thing won't heal I don't
know what's going on with it.

57:51.454 --> 57:53.539
Well have you
been to the doctor?

57:54.706 --> 57:57.251
No I'm gonna have to though.

57:58.628 --> 57:59.796
Hurts like hell you know.

58:05.093 --> 58:07.512
How's the
little guy doing?

58:22.360 --> 58:23.318
She took him.

58:24.528 --> 58:27.488
What, she left?

58:27.490 --> 58:30.827
Yeah well truth be told

58:33.662 --> 58:35.497
it's a long time coming.

58:37.916 --> 58:39.293
Maybe it's for the best.

58:44.256 --> 58:45.717
I'm sorry.

58:48.510 --> 58:49.595
Hey listen.

58:51.972 --> 58:54.974
It's been a while since
you stopped by

58:54.976 --> 58:57.852
you know I'm still paying
for all that equipment.

58:57.854 --> 59:00.479
If I don't get last month's
and this I won't make it.

59:00.481 --> 59:02.606
I'm sorry I
completely forgot.

59:02.608 --> 59:06.943
No dude I need it no
later than tomorrow.

59:06.945 --> 59:08.028
If I don't make a payment
they're gonna

59:08.030 --> 59:10.071
take the equipment and the
truck.

59:10.073 --> 59:12.325
And you won't even have
a job then you know.

59:12.327 --> 59:14.619
Okay, be over there
tomorrow.

59:14.621 --> 59:15.454
Okay good.

59:18.541 --> 59:21.041
This is Stacey Hernandez
on location

59:21.043 --> 59:23.544
downtown near 14th and Harvey.

59:23.546 --> 59:25.588
Earlier today local police were

59:25.590 --> 59:28.048
flagged down by several
transients.

59:28.050 --> 59:30.550
Apparently they found one of
their own

59:30.552 --> 59:35.305
laying in a drainage ditch
dead, possibly murdered.

59:35.307 --> 59:38.059
Today we have an exclusive
interview with lead detective

59:38.061 --> 59:41.729
James Kay concerning
this disturbing death.

59:41.731 --> 59:43.731
We do not know the
cause of death at this time

59:43.733 --> 59:46.526
but the body shows
significant damage.

59:46.528 --> 59:48.986
By damage what
do you mean detective?

59:48.988 --> 59:51.071
Apparently
one or more animals

59:51.073 --> 59:54.325
had removed chunks of flesh
out of the victims left arm.

59:54.327 --> 59:55.829
Were these wounds postmortem?

59:56.912 --> 01:00:00.291
The punctures and tares were.

01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:03.211
Were they
the cause of death sir?

01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:07.048
We do not
know the cause of death.

01:00:08.048 --> 01:00:09.423
Whenever we know
something concrete

01:00:09.425 --> 01:00:11.216
we will give you that
information.

01:00:11.218 --> 01:00:14.178
But detective what
type of bite was on the body?

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.056
Was it canine?

01:00:16.099 --> 01:00:17.100
I have to go.

01:00:18.142 --> 01:00:19.394
Sir, sir.

01:00:20.894 --> 01:00:22.769
Thank you for your time,
Detective.

01:00:22.771 --> 01:00:25.356
This is Stacey Hernandez,
Channel Six

01:00:25.358 --> 01:00:27.068
coming to you live from
downtown.

01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:01.225
Yeah yeah it's not
a thing it's my machine.

01:01:01.227 --> 01:01:04.854
Leave a message at the beep
or text me you know whatever.

01:01:06.106 --> 01:01:09.818
Tony you were supposed to
be here an hour ago, call me.

01:01:14.823 --> 01:01:16.242
Dick.

01:01:18.827 --> 01:01:20.452
Yeah no I know I haven't been in

01:01:20.454 --> 01:01:22.998
for my follow up but I
just have one question.

01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.834
The doctor is in
with a patient right now.

01:01:32.258 --> 01:01:33.966
Can you have him call me back?

01:01:33.968 --> 01:01:35.175
We just need to
schedule your follow up...

01:01:35.177 --> 01:01:37.095
I really need to talk to him.

01:01:38.014 --> 01:01:40.182
Sir is this
concerning your leg injury?

01:01:41.226 --> 01:01:42.101
Not exactly.

01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:49.192
I think the prescription he
gave me is making me see things.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.276
Well what do
you mean see things?

01:01:53.278 --> 01:01:54.363
Like illusions.

01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:57.198
What exactly
are you seeing?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.785
I don't know, things
that shouldn't be there.

01:02:00.787 --> 01:02:04.079
Have you been under
any kind of stress lately?

01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:07.793
Stress, yes I'm seeing things.

01:02:08.919 --> 01:02:09.751
Sir, you really
just need

01:02:09.753 --> 01:02:11.379
to come on in for your
appointment.

01:02:11.381 --> 01:02:15.383
Can I at least get
one more refill?

01:02:15.385 --> 01:02:18.053
The doctor has to see
you first.

01:02:19.347 --> 01:02:21.388
You know what never mind.

01:02:57.343 --> 01:02:58.219
Caleb.

01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:07.055
I'm coming.

01:05:15.356 --> 01:05:16.606
Hello.

01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:19.151
Good morning sir, Detective
James Kay.

01:05:20.195 --> 01:05:22.320
You know your mouth
is bleeding right?

01:05:22.322 --> 01:05:26.657
Oh yeah I get nosebleeds.

01:05:26.659 --> 01:05:28.410
Must of had one
when I was asleep.

01:05:29.369 --> 01:05:31.745
If you need to
clean up, I can wait.

01:05:31.747 --> 01:05:35.041
No no no it's
fine what can I do for you?

01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:36.666
Well it seems your neighbor
Mr. Collins

01:05:36.668 --> 01:05:39.044
has been missing
for several days.

01:05:39.046 --> 01:05:40.631
When was the last
time you saw him?

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.716
Why, what happened?

01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:45.303
We're not sure at this time.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.014
When was the last
time you saw him?

01:05:49.432 --> 01:05:51.432
I don't know I broke
my leg so I've been

01:05:51.434 --> 01:05:54.477
cooped up in here but I saw him

01:05:54.479 --> 01:05:57.607
take his garbage out a few
days ago, Monday I think.

01:05:59.025 --> 01:06:01.108
Have you seen anything
out of the ordinary

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.028
or anything strange in the area?

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:06.696
Sorry I
can't think of anything.

01:06:06.698 --> 01:06:08.198
Are you sure that he didn't just

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.533
go on vacation or something?

01:06:09.535 --> 01:06:12.119
If he did he would be on foot.

01:06:12.121 --> 01:06:13.497
His car's still in the garage.

01:06:16.084 --> 01:06:18.124
He's close to his children
and they said that he wouldn't

01:06:18.126 --> 01:06:20.295
go anywhere unless
that he notified them.

01:06:22.298 --> 01:06:24.465
Yeah,
other than Monday

01:06:24.467 --> 01:06:26.300
I can't think of anything.

01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:28.135
Can I call you if I see
something?

01:06:28.137 --> 01:06:29.639
Sure here's my card.

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:34.517
Oh, by the way,
his dog is missing too.

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:37.647
Ah yes sir,
something got to it.

01:06:38.773 --> 01:06:40.108
What do you mean?

01:06:41.316 --> 01:06:43.151
Something got to it.

01:06:43.153 --> 01:06:44.279
When did this happen?

01:06:46.072 --> 01:06:47.490
About two weeks ago.

01:06:49.242 --> 01:06:50.660
Thank you for your time sir.

01:06:51.577 --> 01:06:52.452
Yes sir.

01:07:00.169 --> 01:07:01.586
Hello?

01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:02.836
Good morning this is
Doctor...

01:07:02.838 --> 01:07:04.421
Ah yeah.

01:07:04.423 --> 01:07:06.506
You had some
questions about your medication?

01:07:06.508 --> 01:07:09.551
No I was just wondering
if my prescription

01:07:09.553 --> 01:07:11.597
caused any vision
problems at all.

01:07:12.639 --> 01:07:14.765
What sort of vision
problems?

01:07:14.767 --> 01:07:16.352
Well I've been seeing these

01:07:17.811 --> 01:07:20.562
little black things in
the corner of my eye.

01:07:20.564 --> 01:07:22.481
Are they black
spots that float around?

01:07:22.483 --> 01:07:23.358
Yeah.

01:07:24.568 --> 01:07:26.695
Did you see them
before starting your medication?

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:31.534
I don't remember.

01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:34.619
It started around the
same time I think.

01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:36.370
Sounds like what
you have are called floaters.

01:07:36.372 --> 01:07:38.330
Yeah maybe that's it.

01:07:38.332 --> 01:07:41.374
I've also been sleepwalking.

01:07:41.376 --> 01:07:42.211
Is that?

01:07:43.086 --> 01:07:44.629
Well that's rare but
the drug

01:07:44.631 --> 01:07:48.216
has been known to trigger
some somnambic activity.

01:07:48.218 --> 01:07:49.802
Why don't you just cut
down on your dosage?

01:07:51.637 --> 01:07:53.595
Okay well I'm out.

01:07:53.597 --> 01:07:55.347
Is there any way I
can pick up today?

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:58.309
I need to reevaluate
your pain medicine strategy.

01:07:58.311 --> 01:07:59.267
We could discuss it...

01:07:59.269 --> 01:08:00.894
I'm in a lot of pain.

01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:03.606
I understand
that but stay off the leg

01:08:03.608 --> 01:08:04.731
and in the meantime
take some Ibuprofen.

01:08:04.733 --> 01:08:06.358
Please.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.653
I'll reevaluate
your medication Thursday.

01:08:08.655 --> 01:08:10.905
I can't wait okay.

01:08:10.907 --> 01:08:14.202
I don't have any
availability till Thursday.

01:08:15.244 --> 01:08:16.828
Take some Ibuprofen and then...

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:17.703
Just please.

01:08:17.705 --> 01:08:20.497
Please can just fill the
prescription?

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.501
I can't do that
without re...

01:08:27.423 --> 01:08:28.550
God damn it.

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:31.875
That little shit.

01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:55.690
Or text me you know
whatever.

01:12:56.692 --> 01:12:57.526
Tony.

01:12:59.528 --> 01:13:02.406
I don't need the truck
I need the money.

01:13:04.116 --> 01:13:06.034
What's the deal, man,
did you quit?

01:13:07.036 --> 01:13:08.037
You need to call me.

01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:17.211
Damn it.

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:48.242
Tony.

01:13:48.244 --> 01:13:50.037
Let me speak
to my daughter.

01:13:51.246 --> 01:13:52.122
I'm sorry.

01:13:53.081 --> 01:13:55.709
Let me
speak to my daughter.

01:13:57.128 --> 01:13:58.213
She's not here.

01:13:59.839 --> 01:14:01.797
Where is she?

01:14:01.799 --> 01:14:03.593
I don't know,
she's not with you?

01:14:04.928 --> 01:14:07.845
Listen, I'm
not playing games here.

01:14:07.847 --> 01:14:09.515
I want to know
where my daughter is.

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:14.935
She left, because of you.

01:14:14.937 --> 01:14:18.064
Don't blame me
for your stupid decisions.

01:14:18.066 --> 01:14:19.858
I only helped by your laziness.

01:14:24.781 --> 01:14:26.239
Helped?

01:14:26.241 --> 01:14:31.246
Yeah yeah you helped you
helped destroy this family.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.704
You helped take Caleb
away from his father.

01:14:34.706 --> 01:14:35.791
That's what you did.

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:38.292
You are
a selfish drunk

01:14:38.294 --> 01:14:40.839
and incapable
of raising a child.

01:14:44.217 --> 01:14:45.844
And how should
I raise a child?

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.637
Like you?

01:14:49.304 --> 01:14:53.101
You're still breastfeeding
your 30 year old daughter.

01:15:03.652 --> 01:15:04.486
Bitch.

01:16:57.933 --> 01:16:59.141
Oh God are you alright?

01:16:59.143 --> 01:17:02.270
Hey hey are you alright?

01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:04.896
Oh shit you're so bloody.

01:17:04.898 --> 01:17:06.774
Alright I'm calling 911.

01:17:06.776 --> 01:17:08.027
I'm gonna call 911 okay.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.696
Yes yes yes I need
an ambulance okay.

01:17:12.698 --> 01:17:14.116
And I just hit someone.

01:17:15.242 --> 01:17:16.910
No he came out of nowhere I'm at

01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:21.124
Flamingo Avenue, 16th Street.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.958
Yeah his eyes are open and
there's blood everywhere.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.878
And he doesn't really seem
to be responding to me.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.755
Okay thank you.

01:17:29.756 --> 01:17:30.967
Hey just stay laying down.

01:17:32.218 --> 01:17:35.180
You're hurt you're bleeding
everywhere bro just stay down.

01:17:37.348 --> 01:17:40.016
Just stay here the
ambulance is coming okay.

01:17:40.018 --> 01:17:40.894
Just stay right.

01:17:41.936 --> 01:17:42.978
You were just hit.

01:17:45.063 --> 01:17:46.106
Are you an idiot?

01:18:12.299 --> 01:18:15.219
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.097
Come here.

01:19:46.477 --> 01:19:49.022
Show yourself you son of a...

01:20:26.893 --> 01:20:28.309
Hey get up you drunk.

01:20:28.311 --> 01:20:30.144
Where's my daughter
and my grandson?

01:20:30.146 --> 01:20:32.607
Let go of me God.

01:20:33.525 --> 01:20:35.485
This place is a wreck.

01:20:38.153 --> 01:20:39.654
What have you done?

01:20:39.656 --> 01:20:41.113
I told
you they left.

01:20:41.115 --> 01:20:42.073
Well anybody in
their right mind

01:20:42.075 --> 01:20:44.408
would have left you in this
filthy pigsty.

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:45.325
But she would have come to me

01:20:45.327 --> 01:20:47.330
and I haven't talked
to her two weeks.

01:20:48.372 --> 01:20:49.249
Oh my God.

01:20:50.457 --> 01:20:51.332
Caleb!

01:20:51.334 --> 01:20:52.919
You have been planning this.

01:20:54.086 --> 01:20:56.421
I told her she could stay
with me if she needed to.

01:20:57.549 --> 01:20:59.384
Where's my daughter
and my grandson?

01:21:02.178 --> 01:21:03.677
Get out.

01:21:03.679 --> 01:21:07.599
I'm not leaving until you
tell me where she, oh my God.

01:21:08.768 --> 01:21:09.644
Oh my God.

01:21:09.893 --> 01:21:10.767
You're crazy.

01:21:10.769 --> 01:21:11.646
The bitch left.

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.815
Which is exactly what you're
about to do.

01:21:20.571 --> 01:21:23.739
You're the reason she's gone.

01:21:34.376 --> 01:21:37.754
You look fine to go
look for her yourself.

01:24:28.593 --> 01:24:30.927
Sounds like
a threat, threat, threat.

01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:31.804
No.

01:24:47.737 --> 01:24:48.613
No no no.

01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:53.827
No.

01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:52.635
No.
