00:35.750 --> 00:40.208
Captain, Doctor, I am

00:35.750 --> 00:40.208
honored by your presence,

00:40.250 --> 00:43.458
but may I suggest

00:40.250 --> 00:43.458
you attend the second concert?

00:43.500 --> 00:45.291
Why, Data?

00:45.333 --> 00:47.750
Ensign Ortiz will perform

00:45.333 --> 00:47.750
the violin part.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.792
My rendition

00:47.792 --> 00:49.792
will be less enjoyable.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.000
Oh?

00:51.041 --> 00:52.875
Although I am

00:51.041 --> 00:52.875
technically proficient,

00:52.917 --> 00:54.834
according

00:52.917 --> 00:54.834
to my fellow performers,

00:54.875 --> 00:57.792
I lack... soul.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.417
Data, telling us

00:59.458 --> 01:01.333
why you're going to fail

00:59.458 --> 01:01.333
before you make the attempt

01:01.375 --> 01:03.417
is never wise.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.166
But is not honesty

01:05.208 --> 01:07.792
always the preferred choice?

01:10.959 --> 01:14.250
Excessive honesty

01:10.959 --> 01:14.250
can be disastrous,

01:14.291 --> 01:15.917
particularly in a commander.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.333
Indeed?

01:17.375 --> 01:18.625
Knowing your own

01:17.375 --> 01:18.625
limitations

01:18.667 --> 01:19.625
is one thing.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.000
Advertising them to a crew

01:21.041 --> 01:23.750
can damage your credibility

01:21.041 --> 01:23.750
as a leader.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.583
Because you will lose

01:23.792 --> 01:26.583
their confidence?

01:26.625 --> 01:28.000
And you may begin

01:28.041 --> 01:30.583
to believe in

01:28.041 --> 01:30.583
those limitations yourself.

RIKER:

01:44.083 --> 01:47.500
Captain, we're

01:44.083 --> 01:47.500
receiving a message

01:47.542 --> 01:49.792
from the Sheliak Corporate.

02:10.417 --> 02:12.959
Origin point of the message

02:10.417 --> 02:12.959
confirmed, sir.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.500
It is from the Shelia

02:13.000 --> 02:15.500
star system.

02:15.542 --> 02:18.208
The Sheliak have not attempted

02:15.542 --> 02:18.208
to communicate

02:18.250 --> 02:20.333
with the Federation

02:18.250 --> 02:20.333
for 111 years.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.834
Why are they doing it now?

02:23.875 --> 02:25.375
On screen.

02:25.417 --> 02:28.458
SHELIAK:

02:25.417 --> 02:28.458
Federation creatures,

02:25.417 --> 02:28.458
there are humans

02:28.500 --> 02:30.709
on the fifth planet

02:28.500 --> 02:30.709
of Tau Cygna.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.208
This planet was ceded

02:30.750 --> 02:33.208
to the Corporate

02:33.250 --> 02:38.500
in section 133, paragraph 77

02:33.250 --> 02:38.500
of the Treaty of Armens.

02:38.542 --> 02:42.625
We will begin settlement

02:38.542 --> 02:42.625
of this world in four days.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.250
Remove the humans.

02:44.291 --> 02:45.583
What the devil...?

02:45.625 --> 02:46.875
SHELIAK:

02:45.625 --> 02:46.875
Federation creatures

02:46.917 --> 02:48.375
there are humans

02:46.917 --> 02:48.375
on the fifth planet...

02:48.417 --> 02:50.875
Cancel message.

02:50.917 --> 02:55.959
Tau Cygna V

02:50.917 --> 02:55.959
is in the de Laure belt--

02:56.000 --> 02:58.333
heavy concentrations

02:56.000 --> 02:58.333
of hyperonic radiation.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.375
Humans can't survive

02:58.375 --> 03:00.375
in that environment.

03:00.417 --> 03:03.083
Exposure to hyperonic radiation

03:00.417 --> 03:03.083
is fatal.

03:03.125 --> 03:06.333
Then the Sheliak are

03:03.125 --> 03:06.333
asking us to chase ghosts.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.834
No, Number One.

03:07.875 --> 03:11.500
The Sheliak haven't broken

03:07.875 --> 03:11.500
a century of silence

03:11.542 --> 03:14.291
to send us after phantoms.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.667
An investigation is in order.

03:16.709 --> 03:19.500
Set course for Tau Cygna V.

03:47.709 --> 03:52.083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:52.125 --> 03:56.041
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:52.125 --> 03:56.041
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:57.917 --> 04:01.959
<i>to explore</i>

03:57.917 --> 04:01.959

04:02.000 --> 04:06.542

05:16.083 --> 05:19.709
Captain, human life-form

05:16.083 --> 05:19.709
readings from the planet.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.750
So the Sheliak

05:19.750 --> 05:21.750
weren't hallucinating.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.500
Numbers?

05:23.542 --> 05:25.709
Impossible to get

05:23.542 --> 05:25.709
an accurate reading.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.041
High levels of radiation

05:25.750 --> 05:28.041
are disrupting our sensors.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.959
DATA:

05:28.083 --> 05:29.959
Hyperonic radiation

05:30.000 --> 05:32.166
also interferes

05:30.000 --> 05:32.166
with ship's transporters.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.625
They are now inoperable.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.291
So are the ship's phasers.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.417
How can humans

05:35.333 --> 05:37.417
survive down there?

05:37.458 --> 05:39.250
They must have found

05:37.458 --> 05:39.250
a way to adapt.

05:39.291 --> 05:41.667
Milan's work

05:39.291 --> 05:41.667
with radiation sensitivity

05:41.709 --> 05:43.083
suggests it is possible.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.709
Perhaps with extensive

05:43.125 --> 05:45.709
virotherapy.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.375
Well, whoever they are,

05:45.750 --> 05:47.375
however they survived,

05:47.417 --> 05:49.000
we've got to get them

05:47.417 --> 05:49.000
off the planet.

05:49.041 --> 05:52.959
By treaty, that world still

05:49.041 --> 05:52.959
belongs to the Sheliak.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.625
Who are within their rights

05:54.667 --> 05:57.792
to demand the removal

05:54.667 --> 05:57.792
of these "trespassers."

05:57.834 --> 06:01.875
If we don't remove them,

05:57.834 --> 06:01.875
the Sheliak will, forcefully.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.000
How forcefully?

06:04.041 --> 06:06.542
The Sheliak consider humans

06:04.041 --> 06:06.542
a lower life-form.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.166
They would have no compunctions

06:08.208 --> 06:10.208
about exterminating

06:08.208 --> 06:10.208
the intruders.

06:10.250 --> 06:13.750
Mr. Data, as you are unaffected

06:10.250 --> 06:13.750
by hyperonic radiation,

06:13.792 --> 06:16.542
I'd like you to go down

06:13.792 --> 06:16.542
to the planet via shuttlecraft

06:16.583 --> 06:18.750
and commence

06:16.583 --> 06:18.750
evacuation procedures.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.291
Aye, sir.

06:20.333 --> 06:24.166
Number One...

06:24.208 --> 06:27.709
any speculation on what

06:24.208 --> 06:27.709
we might find down there?

06:27.750 --> 06:31.709
My guess would be

06:27.750 --> 06:31.709
a lone survey craft.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.959
Maybe a dozen

06:31.750 --> 06:34.959
or so survivors.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.166
I think it's some sort

06:47.917 --> 06:51.166
of shuttlecraft.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.750
Where's it from?

06:52.792 --> 06:54.542
Look at the markings.

06:54.583 --> 06:57.041
It must be from the Federation.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.250
Greetings, gentlemen.

07:03.291 --> 07:06.208
We saw your ship.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.959
You're the first visitor

07:06.250 --> 07:08.959
we've had in...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.166
The first visitor

07:10.208 --> 07:12.083
we've<i> ever</i> had.

07:12.125 --> 07:15.083
You're not human?

07:15.125 --> 07:16.333
That is correct.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.542
I am an android.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.208
I am Lieutenant Commander Data

07:19.250 --> 07:22.041
of the Federation Starship

07:19.250 --> 07:22.041
<i>Enterprise.</i>

07:22.083 --> 07:24.333
Our great-grandparents

07:22.083 --> 07:24.333
were citizens

07:24.375 --> 07:25.959
of the Federation.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.834
But you don't want

07:26.000 --> 07:27.834
to waste your time

07:27.875 --> 07:28.959
talking to us.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.166
You want to speak to Gosheven.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.625
We'll take you to him.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.291
I'm sure the Federation

07:31.667 --> 07:34.291
will be very proud of us.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.333
Wait until you see

07:34.333 --> 07:37.333
all we've accomplished.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.959
And who, precisely,

07:37.375 --> 07:39.959
is "us"?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.250
Don't you know?

07:41.291 --> 07:43.291
Oh, no, I don't guess

07:41.291 --> 07:43.291
you would.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.667
We're descendants

07:43.333 --> 07:46.667
of the original settlers

07:46.709 --> 07:49.250
from the Colony Ship<i> Artemis.</i>

07:49.291 --> 07:50.709
Got it.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.500
The<i> Artemis,</i>

07:50.750 --> 07:52.500
launched 92 years ago.

07:52.542 --> 07:54.250
Destination: Septimis Minor.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.875
When they failed to check in,

07:55.917 --> 07:58.208
Starfleet began

07:55.917 --> 07:58.208
an extensive search.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.125
What carried

07:58.250 --> 08:00.125
the<i> Artemis</i>

08:00.166 --> 08:01.709
so far off course?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.875
My local informant does

08:01.750 --> 08:03.875
not have that information.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.667
In the early days

08:03.917 --> 08:05.667
on Tau Cygna V,

08:05.709 --> 08:08.709
survival was more important

08:05.709 --> 08:08.709
than history.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.709
Understood.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.542
How many are there?

08:11.583 --> 08:14.166
15,253, sir.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.625
15,000?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.917
Three days,

08:16.667 --> 08:18.917
no transporters...

08:18.959 --> 08:21.333
we'll never get them out

08:18.959 --> 08:21.333
in time.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.000
Shuttles?

08:23.041 --> 08:26.375
Loading all the<i> Enterprise</i>

08:23.041 --> 08:26.375
shuttlecraft to capacity,

08:26.417 --> 08:28.542
evacuation will take...

08:28.583 --> 08:30.750
4 weeks, 4 days.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.333
We need more time.

08:32.375 --> 08:36.709
Mister Data, prepare

08:32.375 --> 08:36.709
the colonists for an evacuation.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.166
Aye, sir.

08:38.208 --> 08:39.667
Get me the Sheliak.

08:39.709 --> 08:42.375
Their home world is

08:39.709 --> 08:42.375
quite distant, Captain.

08:42.417 --> 08:43.917
This will take some time.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.709
Gosheven, look what's come.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.542
Lieutenant Commander Data

09:06.750 --> 09:10.542
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

09:10.583 --> 09:12.750
He's an android.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.709
So he is.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.333
Well, now that

09:14.750 --> 09:17.333
you're here...

09:17.375 --> 09:18.959
what do you want?

09:19.000 --> 09:24.166
My mission is to prepare

09:19.000 --> 09:24.166
this colony for evacuation.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.500
Why?

09:25.542 --> 09:28.750
Because this planet belongs

09:25.542 --> 09:28.750
to the Sheliak.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.125
And who is this Sheliak?

09:30.166 --> 09:31.834
The term is plural.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.750
The Sheliak are a nonhumanoid,

09:31.875 --> 09:35.750
intelligent life-form,

09:35.792 --> 09:37.500
classification R-3.

09:37.542 --> 09:41.375
Well, this colony has

09:37.542 --> 09:41.375
been here over 90 years.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.750
We've never seen a Sheliak.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.542
I'd say that makes

09:43.792 --> 09:47.542
Tau Cygna V our planet.

09:47.583 --> 09:51.542
The original destination of the

09:47.583 --> 09:51.542
<i>Artemis</i> was Septimis Minor.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.041
The guidance system

09:51.583 --> 09:54.041
on the<i> Artemis</i> failed.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.208
Took them off course,

09:54.083 --> 09:56.208
far off course.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.208
Our ancestors were lucky

09:56.250 --> 09:59.208
to find any place to land.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.041
And when they did, the radiation

09:59.250 --> 10:02.041
started killing them.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.375
The hyperonic radiation

10:02.083 --> 10:04.375
took the lives of a third

10:04.417 --> 10:06.709
of the colonists,

10:04.417 --> 10:06.709
before they learned

10:04.417 --> 10:06.709
they could adapt to it.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.750
But our colony survived

10:06.750 --> 10:08.750
and prospered.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.208
Look around.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.667
We have brought water

10:10.250 --> 10:11.667
to the desert,

10:11.709 --> 10:13.000
built a community.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.542
Your accomplishments

10:13.041 --> 10:15.542
are truly remarkable.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.750
Yet, the Sheliak

10:15.583 --> 10:18.750
and the Federation have a treaty

10:18.792 --> 10:21.542
which clearly makes this planet

10:18.792 --> 10:21.542
Sheliak domain.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.709
Then change the treaty.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.000
That may not

10:23.750 --> 10:26.000
be possible.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.458
The Sheliak wish

10:26.041 --> 10:28.458
to colonize this planet

10:28.500 --> 10:31.083
and are unwilling

10:28.500 --> 10:31.083
to share it with humans.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.583
If you are still here

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
when the Sheliak

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
colony ship arrives,

10:34.625 --> 10:36.125
they will

10:34.625 --> 10:36.125
eradicate you.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.792
They'd kill all of us?

10:37.834 --> 10:40.250
They have little regard

10:37.834 --> 10:40.250
for human life.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.583
Thus, the most sensible course

10:40.291 --> 10:42.583
of action

10:42.625 --> 10:44.291
is to prepare

10:42.625 --> 10:44.291
a contingency plan

10:44.333 --> 10:46.750
for the evacuation

10:44.333 --> 10:46.750
of your people.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.125
We're not evacuating.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.333
Perhaps I have not

10:49.166 --> 10:51.333
made myself clear.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.625
Yes, you have.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.166
Let me be equally clear.

10:55.208 --> 10:59.208
There's going to be

10:55.208 --> 10:59.208
no evacuation.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.959
You've delivered

10:59.250 --> 11:02.959
your message,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.542
so go back to your ship.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.333
I have work to do.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.375
Nice catch.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.709
Wonderful reflexes.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.750
Sorry to test you like that,

11:23.792 --> 11:25.542
but I was curious.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.625
Found a new toy, have we, Ardy?

11:27.667 --> 11:29.166
Toy?

11:29.208 --> 11:32.917
This is the most incredible

11:29.208 --> 11:32.917
android I've ever seen.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.542
Have you seen many?

11:35.583 --> 11:36.959
Actually, no.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.792
You're the first.

11:38.834 --> 11:43.041
Only you would get this excited

11:38.834 --> 11:43.041
over a walking calculator.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.542
Cybernetic intelligence

11:43.083 --> 11:45.542
fascinates me.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.959
Are your neural pathways

11:45.583 --> 11:47.959
duotronic?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.500
No, positronic.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.000
I didn't know

11:50.542 --> 11:52.000
that was possible.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.542
What's your memory capacity?

11:53.583 --> 11:54.875
How many operations

11:53.583 --> 11:54.875
per second?

11:54.917 --> 11:56.542
I have a million questions.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.458
I am afraid I have

11:56.583 --> 11:59.458
no time to answer a

11:56.583 --> 11:59.458
<i>million</i> questions.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.125
I have a mission

11:59.500 --> 12:01.125
to accomplish.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.166
I need to know more

12:01.166 --> 12:03.166
about your people

12:03.208 --> 12:07.041
and Gosheven seems

12:03.208 --> 12:07.041
unwilling to talk

12:03.208 --> 12:07.041
to me further.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.750
I'm Ard'rian McKenzie.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.917
Perhaps I can help you.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.542
Gentlemen, we're giving you

12:19.375 --> 12:22.542
an assignment.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.917
The one thing

12:22.583 --> 12:24.917
we don't want to hear

12:24.959 --> 12:26.709
is that it's

12:24.959 --> 12:26.709
impossible.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.333
I need the transporters

12:26.750 --> 12:29.333
to function

12:29.375 --> 12:31.709
despite the hyperonic radiation.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.709
Yeah, but that's im...

12:34.750 --> 12:35.917
Yes, sir.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.125
Even if we get

12:40.625 --> 12:43.125
the Sheliak to talk,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.875
they're not likely

12:43.166 --> 12:45.875
to be accommodating.

12:45.917 --> 12:49.834
Captain, when the treaty

12:45.917 --> 12:49.834
was first negotiated,

12:49.875 --> 12:53.333
the Federation sent

12:49.875 --> 12:53.333
372 legal experts.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.667
What do we have?

12:55.709 --> 12:57.667
Thee and me.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.667
No response.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.667
Try them again.

13:14.709 --> 13:17.667
Boost the signal strength.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.792
Sheliak Corporate.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.083
This is

13:22.834 --> 13:25.083
the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

13:25.125 --> 13:26.959
Respond, please.

13:31.834 --> 13:35.792
Conversation is

13:31.834 --> 13:35.792
neither required, nor desired.

13:35.834 --> 13:39.750
Conversation is necessary

13:35.834 --> 13:39.750
if we are to find a solution

13:39.792 --> 13:42.542
to our mutual problem.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.083
Our involvement

13:42.583 --> 13:45.083
in Federation illegality

13:45.125 --> 13:47.291
is not indicated.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.959
Both parties are involved, sir.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.375
Remove the humans

13:50.000 --> 13:53.375
from the Tau Cygna system.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.125
Three Earth-days remain.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.625
Let us negotiate in good faith.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.834
Negotiate?

13:59.875 --> 14:01.709
To what purpose?

14:01.750 --> 14:03.417
The treaty is signed.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.834
There is a thriving colony

14:03.458 --> 14:06.834
on that planet.

14:06.875 --> 14:11.542
Rather than uproot these people,

14:06.875 --> 14:11.542
may I offer a compromise?

14:11.583 --> 14:13.083
Denied.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.458
Why?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.667
The law is paramount.

14:16.709 --> 14:18.417
We are entitled.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.959
This is not a law.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.291
It is a treaty.

14:22.333 --> 14:27.166
It is... designed to smooth

14:22.333 --> 14:27.166
relations between races,

14:27.208 --> 14:29.709
not to act

14:27.208 --> 14:29.709
as a strait...

14:32.375 --> 14:34.375
...jacket.

14:34.417 --> 14:37.667
You really think we'll have

14:34.417 --> 14:37.667
to leave Tau Cygna V?

14:37.709 --> 14:39.750
The possibility

14:37.709 --> 14:39.750
does exist.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.250
Yet Gosheven seems unwilling

14:39.792 --> 14:43.250
to prepare for it.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.417
Why?

14:44.458 --> 14:46.333
Maybe because

14:44.458 --> 14:46.333
you're an android.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.709
I don't think Gosheven

14:46.375 --> 14:48.709
likes the idea

14:48.750 --> 14:50.709
of machines

14:48.750 --> 14:50.709
ordering him around.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.917
I am not ordering him

14:50.750 --> 14:53.917
to do anything.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.709
I am merely trying

14:53.959 --> 14:55.709
to persuade him

14:55.750 --> 14:57.750
that his people should

14:55.750 --> 14:57.750
prepare to evacuate.

14:57.792 --> 15:00.792
Do you believe

14:57.792 --> 15:00.792
my suggested course of action

15:00.834 --> 15:02.500
should be followed?

15:02.542 --> 15:03.875
Of course.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.083
In spite of the fact

15:03.917 --> 15:06.083
that I am an android?

15:06.125 --> 15:08.083
<i>Because</i> of that fact.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.792
I don't have any silly prejudice

15:08.125 --> 15:09.792
against computers.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.208
I like them.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.709
Not that any computer we have

15:12.750 --> 15:15.208
is half as sophisticated

15:12.750 --> 15:15.208
as you are.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.250
No, I would say not.

15:20.291 --> 15:23.667
People can be

15:20.291 --> 15:23.667
selfish, irrational,

15:23.709 --> 15:25.500
stubborn, malicious--

15:23.709 --> 15:25.500
you name it--

15:25.542 --> 15:27.792
but computers

15:25.542 --> 15:27.792
don't have those failings.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.917
And you conclude because of this

15:27.834 --> 15:30.917
that I am impartial.

15:30.959 --> 15:34.041
Hence, you accept

15:30.959 --> 15:34.041
my recommendations.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.166
Yet, Gosheven

15:34.083 --> 15:36.166
does not.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.041
Picard to Commander Data.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.542
Data here.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.792
The Sheliak won't bargain.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.709
Understood, sir.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.750
I'm contacting Starfleet

15:43.750 --> 15:45.750
to arrange transport.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.750
Get those people prepared

15:45.792 --> 15:47.750
to evacuate.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.166
We may have to move quickly.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.417
Aye, sir.

15:50.458 --> 15:54.333
We must speak

15:50.458 --> 15:54.333
to Gosheven immediately.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

16:14.125 --> 16:16.000
Hmm, mm, mm.

16:25.458 --> 16:28.792
Gentlemen, how's it coming?

16:28.834 --> 16:31.834
What the hell

16:28.834 --> 16:31.834
is that?

16:31.875 --> 16:33.709
Our first attempt.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.792
Keep at it.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.792
We need those transporters.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.750
(<i> water running</i> )

16:45.458 --> 16:48.375
You see this?

16:48.417 --> 16:51.583
You have any idea what it is

16:48.417 --> 16:51.583
or what it means?

16:51.625 --> 16:53.250
It is water,

16:51.625 --> 16:53.250
a substance composed

16:53.291 --> 16:55.959
of two atoms

16:53.291 --> 16:55.959
of hydrogen...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.458
It's not water.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.083
It's blood and it's sweat.

16:59.125 --> 17:02.375
It's the result of 90 years

16:59.125 --> 17:02.375
of combined effort.

17:02.417 --> 17:03.792
This isn't a town,

17:03.834 --> 17:06.250
it's a monument

17:03.834 --> 17:06.250
to every man, woman, and child

17:06.291 --> 17:08.583
who's lived and died

17:06.291 --> 17:08.583
on Tau Cygna V.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.375
Gosheven,

17:08.625 --> 17:10.375
you're talking nonsense.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.750
Am I?

17:11.792 --> 17:15.041
My grandfather is buried

17:11.792 --> 17:15.041
on that mountain.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.375
He died in a rock slide

17:16.417 --> 17:18.667
surveying the route

17:16.417 --> 17:18.667
for this aqueduct.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.750
This colony exists

17:18.709 --> 17:21.750
because of his sacrifice

17:21.792 --> 17:25.834
and the sacrifice

17:21.792 --> 17:25.834
of thousands of others.

17:25.875 --> 17:29.375
No, we are not leaving.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.750
The Sheliak will not accept

17:29.417 --> 17:32.750
humans on their planet

17:32.792 --> 17:35.667
and they will not hesitate

17:32.792 --> 17:35.667
to use force to remove you.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.542
We'll not be bullied

17:35.709 --> 17:37.542
off our land,

17:37.583 --> 17:42.000
not by you,

17:37.583 --> 17:42.000
and not by the Sheliak.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.750
Stubborn<i> and</i> irrational.

17:45.792 --> 17:48.500
Now what do we do?

17:48.542 --> 17:52.375
Are his sentiments typical

17:48.542 --> 17:52.375
of the colonists?

17:52.417 --> 17:54.542
I hope not.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.375
If I can convince

17:54.583 --> 17:56.375
enough of the people

17:56.417 --> 17:57.709
of the necessity of leaving...

17:57.750 --> 18:00.000
Don't you mean

17:57.750 --> 18:00.000
if<i> we</i> can convince?

18:06.625 --> 18:07.625
Come.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.125
Yes, sir.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.333
Three weeks.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.458
Starfleet is profuse

18:11.375 --> 18:13.458
in its apologies,

18:13.500 --> 18:16.750
but it will still

18:13.500 --> 18:16.750
be three weeks...

18:16.792 --> 18:20.125
until the arrival

18:16.792 --> 18:20.125
of a colony transport ship

18:20.166 --> 18:22.792
equipped with dedicated

18:20.166 --> 18:22.792
personnel shuttles.

18:22.834 --> 18:25.000
We can't wait three weeks.

18:25.041 --> 18:27.709
Then the Sheliak must agree

18:25.041 --> 18:27.709
to extend our deadline.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.333
If they plan to settle

18:31.458 --> 18:34.333
Tau Cygna V

18:34.375 --> 18:36.625
two days from now...

18:36.667 --> 18:39.166
One of their ships

18:36.667 --> 18:39.166
must already be en route.

18:39.208 --> 18:42.333
We're going to intercept

18:39.208 --> 18:42.333
that ship.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.291
The Sheliak may interpret that

18:42.375 --> 18:45.291
as a hostile act.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.834
It's a risk

18:45.333 --> 18:46.834
we have to take.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.333
The<i> Enterprise</i> is going

18:56.375 --> 18:58.750
to intercept

18:56.375 --> 18:58.750
the Sheliak colony ship.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.250
Now your job...

19:00.291 --> 19:02.166
Well, you know what your job is.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.417
DATA:

19:02.208 --> 19:03.417
Commander,

19:03.458 --> 19:04.709
in human parlance,

19:04.750 --> 19:08.250
I do not believe

19:04.750 --> 19:08.250
I can get the job done.

19:08.291 --> 19:11.166
My training has prepared me

19:08.291 --> 19:11.166
for starship command duties.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.375
As a cultural contact,

19:11.208 --> 19:13.375
I am proving to be

19:13.417 --> 19:14.709
less than exemplary.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.291
What's the situation?

19:16.333 --> 19:18.583
Their leader refuses my counsel.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.000
He denies the logic

19:18.625 --> 19:21.000
of my arguments

19:21.041 --> 19:23.458
and speaks of structures

19:21.041 --> 19:23.458
they have built.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.625
Then try something else.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.208
I have, sir.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.709
In the last three hours

19:26.250 --> 19:28.709
and eight minutes,

19:28.750 --> 19:30.625
I have spoken with 56 colonists.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.208
Ten of those refused to believe

19:30.667 --> 19:33.208
a threat exists.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.291
22 favor staying

19:33.250 --> 19:36.291
and fighting the Sheliak.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.375
16 prefer negotiation

19:36.333 --> 19:40.375
or some sort

19:40.417 --> 19:41.834
of passive resistance.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.125
Only eight were willing

19:41.875 --> 19:44.125
to consider evacuation

19:44.166 --> 19:45.417
and of those eight...

19:45.458 --> 19:47.709
Data, I can't help you.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.834
I don't know these people.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.834
I haven't talked to them.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.417
You have.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.834
Use that fancy positronic brain

19:51.458 --> 19:53.834
of yours

19:53.875 --> 19:55.834
and carry out your mission.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.709
Sir, if I do not succeed,

19:57.750 --> 20:00.834
how violent is the Sheliak

19:57.750 --> 20:00.834
reaction likely to be?

20:00.875 --> 20:02.959
The treaty is the only thing

20:00.875 --> 20:02.959
that prevented them

20:03.000 --> 20:05.834
from eradicating the colony

20:03.000 --> 20:05.834
the moment they discovered it.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.834
Ah.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.000
"Ah" is right, Data.

20:10.041 --> 20:13.792
The lives of 15,000 people

20:10.041 --> 20:13.792
are riding on you.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.625
You'd better get innovative.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.041
Riker out.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.291
Data?

20:19.333 --> 20:21.125
We're having an effect.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.625
So many people are asking

20:21.166 --> 20:23.625
questions about the Sheliak

20:23.667 --> 20:25.959
that Gosheven has called

20:23.667 --> 20:25.959
a public meeting.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.375
Is there any indication

20:27.417 --> 20:29.000
that Gosheven

20:27.417 --> 20:29.000
has changed his position?

20:29.041 --> 20:31.834
No, but a meeting

20:29.041 --> 20:31.834
will give you a chance

20:31.875 --> 20:33.917
to present your

20:31.875 --> 20:33.917
recommendations.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.750
So far, my attempts

20:33.959 --> 20:35.750
at persuasion

20:35.792 --> 20:37.709
have been ineffective.

20:48.875 --> 20:49.875
Why did you do that?

20:49.917 --> 20:52.166
You appeared to need it.

20:54.375 --> 20:58.458
Among humans, a kiss usually

20:54.375 --> 20:58.458
serves to seal a friendship

20:58.500 --> 21:02.834
or indicate support,

20:58.500 --> 21:02.834
attraction, affection.

21:02.875 --> 21:07.291
In this context, I must assume

21:02.875 --> 21:07.291
that your intention

21:07.333 --> 21:09.834
was to express support.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.834
You really don't understand

21:09.875 --> 21:12.834
human behavior, do you?

21:12.875 --> 21:15.166
That is something

21:12.875 --> 21:15.166
of an understatement.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.166
Well, sometimes

21:15.208 --> 21:17.166
I don't either.

21:17.208 --> 21:20.041
Androids are a lot

21:17.208 --> 21:20.041
more rational.

21:20.083 --> 21:22.792
Thus far, that quality

21:20.083 --> 21:22.792
has not helped me

21:22.834 --> 21:24.458
to accomplish my mission.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.500
A rational argument

21:24.500 --> 21:27.500
isn't always enough.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.625
Maybe, to be more persuasive,

21:29.667 --> 21:32.500
you need to use a little

21:29.667 --> 21:32.500
reverse psychology.

21:34.667 --> 21:39.667
Ah, elicit a desired behavior

21:34.667 --> 21:39.667
by advocating its opposite.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.125
That implies deception,

21:39.709 --> 21:42.125
does it not?

21:42.166 --> 21:45.750
A little, but if it helps

21:42.166 --> 21:45.750
us get our point across...

21:45.792 --> 21:49.667
Perhaps this is a situation

21:45.792 --> 21:49.667
where excessive honesty

21:49.709 --> 21:51.083
can be detrimental.

22:04.583 --> 22:07.875
Now, how are

22:04.583 --> 22:07.875
we progressing,

22:04.583 --> 22:07.875
Mr. La Forge?

22:07.917 --> 22:09.000
About like you'd expect, sir.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.458
Splendid,

22:09.041 --> 22:10.458
splendid.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
Carry on.

22:12.542 --> 22:15.125
WESLEY:

22:12.542 --> 22:15.125
He wants the impossible.

22:15.166 --> 22:20.291
LA FORGE:

22:15.166 --> 22:20.291
That's the short definition

22:15.166 --> 22:20.291
of "captain."

22:35.667 --> 22:39.166
GOSHEVEN:

22:35.667 --> 22:39.166
You've all heard of the android

22:35.667 --> 22:39.166
Starfleet has sent here

22:39.208 --> 22:42.709
and you've been discussing

22:39.208 --> 22:42.709
why he's come.

22:45.083 --> 22:46.792
I called this meeting

22:46.834 --> 22:50.667
to replace misinformation

22:46.834 --> 22:50.667
with cold, hard fact.

22:50.709 --> 22:54.375
I wish to speak.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.625
No, leave now.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.834
Do you consider

22:56.667 --> 22:58.834
your position so weak

22:58.875 --> 23:01.250
that it cannot

22:58.875 --> 23:01.250
withstand a debate?

23:01.291 --> 23:02.500
Let him speak.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.083
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

23:17.083 --> 23:20.125
You all know

23:17.083 --> 23:20.125
of the Sheliak threat.

23:20.166 --> 23:24.625
Starfleet wishes to evacuate you

23:20.166 --> 23:24.625
for your own protection.

23:24.667 --> 23:29.792
Yet Gosheven

23:24.667 --> 23:29.792
has decided otherwise.

23:29.834 --> 23:32.083
That is his right

23:32.125 --> 23:35.291
and I will not waste time

23:32.125 --> 23:35.291
trying to reverse that decision.

23:35.333 --> 23:40.166
I admire your conviction

23:35.333 --> 23:40.166
in the face of certain defeat.

23:40.208 --> 23:44.125
Though doomed,

23:40.208 --> 23:44.125
your effort will be valiant

23:44.166 --> 23:46.750
and when you die,

23:46.792 --> 23:50.333
you will die

23:46.792 --> 23:50.333
for land and for honor.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.583
Your children will understand

24:00.625 --> 24:04.125
that they are dying

24:00.625 --> 24:04.125
for a worthy cause.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.542
Long after the battle is over,

24:06.583 --> 24:12.000
their courage

24:06.583 --> 24:12.000
will be remembered and extolled.

24:12.041 --> 24:13.792
Remembered by who?

24:13.834 --> 24:19.625
Yes, that is true.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.625
There will be no one left alive

24:19.667 --> 24:22.625
to remember.

24:22.667 --> 24:26.291
(<i> clapping</i> )

24:26.333 --> 24:28.250
A valiant try, android.

24:28.291 --> 24:33.500
But what a low opinion

24:28.291 --> 24:33.500
you must have of us.

24:33.542 --> 24:34.792
I was simply attempting

24:34.834 --> 24:36.834
to describe

24:34.834 --> 24:36.834
your inevitable destruction

24:36.875 --> 24:38.709
in a manner that would have

24:36.875 --> 24:38.709
an emotional effect.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.083
And he describes it

24:38.750 --> 24:41.083
pretty damn well.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.083
Are you ready to follow

24:41.125 --> 24:43.083
this machine?

24:43.125 --> 24:44.792
Give up without a fight?

24:44.834 --> 24:47.125
He says we're going to lose,

24:47.166 --> 24:49.792
but I think that's just

24:47.166 --> 24:49.792
his cowardice talking.

24:49.834 --> 24:52.041
MAN:

24:49.834 --> 24:52.041
What if he's right

24:49.834 --> 24:52.041
and you're wrong?

24:52.083 --> 24:55.041
Shouldn't we consider

24:52.083 --> 24:55.041
that possibility?

24:55.083 --> 24:56.834
This colony exists

24:56.875 --> 24:59.583
because generations

24:56.875 --> 24:59.583
gave their lives for it.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.083
Many died

25:01.125 --> 25:03.542
before we found a way

25:01.125 --> 25:03.542
to adapt to the radiation

25:03.583 --> 25:06.917
and many more died

25:03.583 --> 25:06.917
bringing water to this desert.

25:06.959 --> 25:08.375
My grandfather...

25:08.417 --> 25:09.750
Is buried on that mountain.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.959
Well, who'll be left

25:09.792 --> 25:11.959
to bury you?

25:18.667 --> 25:22.583
Have you considered

25:18.667 --> 25:22.583
what this evacuation means?

25:22.625 --> 25:26.750
Everything we have, we abandon.

25:26.792 --> 25:30.875
Everything that we have built

25:26.792 --> 25:30.875
turns to dust.

25:30.917 --> 25:34.792
Everything that we have

25:30.917 --> 25:34.792
accomplished means nothing.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.750
Well, I say no.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.959
You elected me your leader.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.333
Follow me now.

25:40.375 --> 25:42.917
I don't think our chances

25:42.959 --> 25:45.792
are as hopeless as he says,

25:45.834 --> 25:50.709
and I'm willing to stake

25:45.834 --> 25:50.709
our lives on it.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.875
Any objections?

25:57.125 --> 26:02.667
Good, because here we stand.

26:02.709 --> 26:03.959
Aye.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.417
We stand with you, Gosheven.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.250
Then here you die.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.750
Mr. Data, I just

26:23.625 --> 26:25.750
want you to know

26:25.792 --> 26:28.709
that Gosheven doesn't

26:25.792 --> 26:28.709
speak for all of us.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.291
I see no reason

26:28.750 --> 26:31.291
to die needlessly.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.917
And you?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.291
I'm not sure.

26:34.333 --> 26:35.792
Gosheven's done

26:34.333 --> 26:35.792
well for us,

26:35.834 --> 26:38.500
but I'd like to

26:35.834 --> 26:38.500
hear more of what

26:35.834 --> 26:38.500
you have to say.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.667
There are many others

26:38.542 --> 26:40.667
that feel the same way,

26:40.709 --> 26:43.083
but they're very uneasy

26:40.709 --> 26:43.083
about confronting Gosheven.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.709
Get them together

26:43.125 --> 26:45.709
and we'll meet at my house.

26:51.583 --> 26:54.583
In our dealings

26:51.583 --> 26:54.583
with other non-humanoid races,

26:54.625 --> 26:57.750
there has always been

26:54.625 --> 26:57.750
some point of reference.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.333
Not so with the Sheliak.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.834
But we must have

26:59.375 --> 27:01.834
something in common.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.166
We communicate.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.667
Barely.

27:04.709 --> 27:07.875
They have learned several

27:04.709 --> 27:07.875
Federation languages,

27:07.917 --> 27:10.291
but theirs continues

27:07.917 --> 27:10.291
to elude us.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.417
Telepaths?

27:12.458 --> 27:16.291
Attempted and failed.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.291
Actually, the fact

27:16.333 --> 27:18.291
that any alien race

27:18.333 --> 27:23.417
communicates with another

27:18.333 --> 27:23.417
is quite remarkable.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.959
We are stranded on a planet.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.875
We have no language in common,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.875
but I want to teach you mine.

27:29.917 --> 27:33.000
<i>S'smarith.</i>

27:33.041 --> 27:34.709
What did I just say?

27:34.750 --> 27:36.166
Cup?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.667
Glass?

27:38.709 --> 27:40.291
Are you sure?

27:40.333 --> 27:45.709
I may have meant "liquid,"

27:40.333 --> 27:45.709
"clear," "brown," "hot."

27:45.750 --> 27:50.709
We conceptualize the universe

27:45.750 --> 27:50.709
in relatively the same way.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.083
Point taken.

27:52.125 --> 27:59.000
In your talks, you must be

27:52.125 --> 27:59.000
extremely accurate.

27:59.041 --> 28:02.834
The treaty is 500,000 words.

28:02.875 --> 28:06.125
The length was to accommodate

28:02.875 --> 28:06.125
the Sheliak.

28:06.166 --> 28:08.542
They consider our language

28:06.166 --> 28:08.542
irrational

28:08.583 --> 28:11.375
and demanded this level

28:08.583 --> 28:11.375
of complexity

28:11.417 --> 28:13.875
to avoid any future

28:11.417 --> 28:13.875
misunderstandings.

28:13.917 --> 28:15.667
RIKER:

28:13.917 --> 28:15.667
Captain, we have the vessel

28:15.709 --> 28:18.000
carrying the Sheliak colonists

28:15.709 --> 28:18.000
on visual.

28:18.041 --> 28:20.125
On my way.

28:20.166 --> 28:23.458
So. It begins.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.583
Hailing frequencies.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.291
Open.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.208
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

28:30.333 --> 28:33.208
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

28:34.250 --> 28:36.750
Your purpose,<i> Enterprise?</i>

28:36.792 --> 28:39.834
We desire face-to-face

28:36.792 --> 28:39.834
negotiations

28:39.875 --> 28:43.000
to settle the crisis

28:39.875 --> 28:43.000
on Tau Cygna V.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.125
Meaningless.

28:44.166 --> 28:47.000
We are entitled to consultation

28:47.041 --> 28:51.375
under paragraph 653,

28:47.041 --> 28:51.375
subparagraph nine.

28:51.417 --> 28:54.667
Granted.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.500
Was that

28:56.125 --> 28:58.500
an invitation?

28:58.542 --> 29:00.208
I am taking it as such.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.458
Counselor.

29:01.500 --> 29:02.625
You have the Bridge, Number One.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.834
Helm, maintain

29:02.667 --> 29:04.834
relative position.

29:04.875 --> 29:08.583
Mr. Worf, tell Transporter

29:04.875 --> 29:08.583
Room 2 to stand by.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.583
Aye, sir.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.834
And once the Federation

29:10.625 --> 29:12.834
resettles us,

29:12.875 --> 29:14.166
we'll be left alone?

29:14.208 --> 29:15.375
If you so desire.

29:15.417 --> 29:16.542
We do.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.083
We like to do things

29:16.583 --> 29:18.083
on our own.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.083
The Federation will

29:18.125 --> 29:20.083
offer as little

29:20.125 --> 29:22.041
or as much help

29:20.125 --> 29:22.041
as you dictate.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.333
Kentor, are you with us?

29:24.375 --> 29:29.083
Yes. The question is,

29:24.375 --> 29:29.083
how do we convince Gosheven?

29:29.125 --> 29:30.917
Well, why do we need to?

29:30.959 --> 29:32.333
Because he's respected.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.500
Most people will do

29:32.375 --> 29:34.500
what he says.

29:34.542 --> 29:36.166
They respect you, too.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.000
If you take a stand,

29:36.208 --> 29:38.000
they'll fall in line.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.333
I don't know.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.500
Gosheven's got

29:39.375 --> 29:41.500
a lot of supporters.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.917
GOSHEVEN:

29:41.542 --> 29:43.917
Don't forget that, Kentor.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.542
I'm disappointed.

29:48.583 --> 29:51.125
I thought we'd settled this.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.917
Apparently, that

29:51.166 --> 29:53.917
is not correct.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.709
Still stirring up trouble?

29:57.750 --> 29:59.792
Since when is talk trouble?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.375
It's over.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.792
Don't you get it?

30:08.834 --> 30:10.583
You had your say.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.166
You lost.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.792
I appear to be reversing

30:12.208 --> 30:14.792
that defeat.

30:14.834 --> 30:16.083
No, you're not.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.792
You're just stubborn.

30:17.834 --> 30:20.041
Well, let me tell you something.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.500
So am I.

30:25.542 --> 30:27.709
Damn you, Gosheven.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.583
You killed him.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.375
I've killed no one.

30:31.417 --> 30:33.083
I merely shut down a machine.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.500
That's it, everyone.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.250
It's time to go home.

30:40.375 --> 30:42.917
You'll see that I'm right.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.917
Advance and speak.

31:28.208 --> 31:34.125
Director, we will comply

31:28.208 --> 31:34.125
with your request

31:34.166 --> 31:36.750
to remove the colony

31:34.166 --> 31:36.750
from Tau Cygna V,

31:36.792 --> 31:38.291
but we need time.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.750
The given time has elapsed.

31:40.792 --> 31:42.333
We carry the membership

31:42.375 --> 31:45.166
and we will proceed

31:42.375 --> 31:45.166
with their debarkation.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.458
The temporary presence

31:45.208 --> 31:47.458
of these humans

31:47.500 --> 31:49.458
should not interfere

31:47.500 --> 31:49.458
with your plans.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.667
Unacceptable.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.667
You must remove the creatures.

31:52.709 --> 31:55.333
I'm trying, but

31:52.709 --> 31:55.333
the needed ship

31:55.375 --> 31:57.291
will not be available

31:55.375 --> 31:57.291
for three weeks.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.750
Then you are in violation.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.667
I have admitted that.

32:01.709 --> 32:07.792
I am only asking for

32:01.709 --> 32:07.792
a little flexibility.

32:07.834 --> 32:12.083
Section 501, paragraph 716,

32:07.834 --> 32:12.083
subparagraph five.

32:12.125 --> 32:16.125
"Unwanted life-forms

32:12.125 --> 32:16.125
inhabiting H-Class worlds

32:16.166 --> 32:19.125
may be removed at the discretion

32:16.166 --> 32:19.125
of the Sheliak Corporate."

32:19.166 --> 32:21.542
<i>We</i> will remove them,

32:21.583 --> 32:24.500
but you must grant us

32:21.583 --> 32:24.500
the time we require.

32:24.542 --> 32:27.959
You need time, Picard,

32:24.542 --> 32:27.959
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

32:28.000 --> 32:29.667
We will save you time.

32:29.709 --> 32:33.333
We will eradicate

32:29.709 --> 32:33.333
the human infestation.

32:33.375 --> 32:34.667
They are not vermin.

32:34.709 --> 32:36.083
They are citizens

32:34.709 --> 32:36.083
of the Federation.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.625
I will not permit this outrage!

32:37.667 --> 32:40.542
Intelligent converse

32:37.667 --> 32:40.542
is impossible.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.291
You do not discuss.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.750
You gibber.

32:43.792 --> 32:47.041
Between intelligent

32:43.792 --> 32:47.041
species of good will...

32:50.542 --> 32:54.458
I take it the Sheliak

32:50.542 --> 32:54.458
just hung up on us again.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.458
I was afraid

33:06.458 --> 33:08.458
your neural pathways

33:08.500 --> 33:10.458
were scrambled beyond repair.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.792
I am equipped with

33:10.500 --> 33:12.792
diagnostic circuits

33:12.834 --> 33:15.458
and am able to correct

33:12.834 --> 33:15.458
many malfunctions.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.709
I'm not surprised

33:15.500 --> 33:17.709
at Gosheven's behavior,

33:17.750 --> 33:19.208
but Kentor and the others

33:19.250 --> 33:21.000
they said they were with us.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.542
I guess words

33:21.041 --> 33:23.542
don't mean very much.

33:23.583 --> 33:26.792
Perhaps that is a part

33:23.583 --> 33:26.792
of our difficulty.

33:26.834 --> 33:29.500
Words are all

33:26.834 --> 33:29.500
we have been using.

33:29.542 --> 33:34.667
Humans seem to take

33:29.542 --> 33:34.667
much stronger notice of actions.

33:34.709 --> 33:37.959
I require a phaser.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.583
What's a phaser?

33:39.625 --> 33:41.375
A type of weapon.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.542
Unfortunately,

33:41.417 --> 33:43.542
it does not function

33:43.583 --> 33:46.625
in the presence

33:43.583 --> 33:46.625
of hyperonic radiation.

33:46.667 --> 33:49.041
I will have to be innovative.

33:50.834 --> 33:55.583
Hyperonic radiation

33:50.834 --> 33:55.583
randomizes phaser beams,

33:55.625 --> 33:58.583
but I believe I can improvise

33:55.625 --> 33:58.583
a servocircuit

33:58.625 --> 34:01.417
which will compensate

34:01.458 --> 34:03.792
by continuously

34:01.458 --> 34:03.792
recollimating the output.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.625
You're using your own

34:03.834 --> 34:05.625
neural subprocessors

34:05.667 --> 34:07.875
to build a smarter phaser.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.625
Essentially correct.

34:12.375 --> 34:14.208
Get word to Gosheven.

34:14.250 --> 34:18.250
Tell him I am coming

34:14.250 --> 34:18.250
to the pumping station.

34:18.291 --> 34:22.333
Tell him I am going

34:18.291 --> 34:22.333
to destroy the aqueduct.

34:22.375 --> 34:26.041
He'll try to stop you.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.542
I sincerely hope so.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.542
Go to yellow alert.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.709
Shields up.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.250
Aye, sir.

34:49.291 --> 34:51.375
Mr. Riker, put us nose-to-nose

34:49.291 --> 34:51.375
with the Sheliak vessel.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.667
Any move she makes,

34:51.417 --> 34:52.667
match it.

34:52.709 --> 34:53.750
Aye, sir.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.250
Mr. Worf, hailing frequency.

34:56.291 --> 34:58.250
Open.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.875
They're not responding.

35:01.917 --> 35:05.834
They don't have to answer.

35:01.917 --> 35:05.834
They just have to listen.

35:05.875 --> 35:07.792
Sheliak vessel...

35:07.834 --> 35:09.875
you will have to get past me

35:09.917 --> 35:12.834
to get at the colony

35:09.917 --> 35:12.834
on Tau Cygna V.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.333
No response.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.875
Close channel.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.166
And get me that treaty.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.792
They've been beating us over

35:21.208 --> 35:23.792
the head with it for three days.

35:23.834 --> 35:26.375
Let's see if we can't

35:23.834 --> 35:26.375
find something in it

35:26.417 --> 35:28.917
that we can turn

35:26.417 --> 35:28.917
to our own advantage.

35:48.834 --> 35:51.166
(<i> yells</i> )

35:54.959 --> 35:56.458
DATA:

35:54.959 --> 35:56.458
Stop.

36:02.208 --> 36:05.125
That was the "stun" setting.

36:05.166 --> 36:06.875
This is not.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.333
(<i> all gasping</i> )

36:18.583 --> 36:21.542
I can reduce

36:18.583 --> 36:21.542
this pumping station

36:21.583 --> 36:23.458
to a pile of debris.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.458
But I trust my point is clear.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.709
I am but one android

36:26.500 --> 36:29.709
with a single weapon.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.583
There are hundreds of Sheliak

36:29.750 --> 36:32.583
on the way

36:32.625 --> 36:35.667
and their weapons

36:32.625 --> 36:35.667
are far more powerful.

36:35.709 --> 36:38.375
They may not

36:35.709 --> 36:38.375
offer you a target.

36:38.417 --> 36:42.250
They can obliterate you

36:38.417 --> 36:42.250
from orbit.

36:42.291 --> 36:48.625
You will die, never having

36:42.291 --> 36:48.625
seen the faces of your killers.

36:48.667 --> 36:51.083
The choice is yours.

36:53.583 --> 36:56.834
There are other places,

36:53.583 --> 36:56.834
other challenges.

36:56.875 --> 36:58.458
(<i> people agreeing</i> )

37:13.208 --> 37:15.250
(<i> groaning</i> )

37:40.041 --> 37:43.458
I really was willing

37:40.041 --> 37:43.458
to stay here and die for this.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.834
I know that.

37:45.875 --> 37:51.250
This is just a thing and

37:45.875 --> 37:51.250
things can be replaced.

Lives cannot.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.834
WORF:

38:11.792 --> 38:13.834
This is hopeless.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.417
Fighting would

38:13.875 --> 38:16.417
be preferable.

38:22.834 --> 38:23.917
That's it.

38:23.959 --> 38:26.500
I don't

38:23.959 --> 38:26.500
follow you, sir.

38:26.542 --> 38:29.291
Mr. Worf, get me

38:26.542 --> 38:29.291
the Sheliak.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.542
Yes, sir.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.375
Coming through, sir.

38:43.834 --> 38:47.834
PICARD:

38:43.834 --> 38:47.834
Pursuant to paragraph 1290,

38:47.875 --> 38:49.500
I hereby formally request

38:49.542 --> 38:51.917
third party arbitration

38:49.542 --> 38:51.917
of our dispute.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.083
You have the right.

38:56.125 --> 39:00.458
Furthermore,

38:56.125 --> 39:00.458
pursuant to subsection D-3,

39:00.500 --> 39:04.542
I name the Grisellas

39:00.500 --> 39:04.542
to arbitrate.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.000
Grisellas?

39:06.041 --> 39:07.792
Unfortunately,

39:06.041 --> 39:07.792
they are currently

39:07.834 --> 39:09.208
in their hibernation cycle.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.208
However, they will awaken

39:09.250 --> 39:11.208
in six months,

39:11.250 --> 39:14.792
at which time we can get

39:11.250 --> 39:14.792
this matter settled.

39:14.834 --> 39:21.333
Now, do you want to wait

39:14.834 --> 39:21.333
or give me my three weeks?

39:21.375 --> 39:22.417
Absurd.

39:22.458 --> 39:24.333
We carry the membership.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.083
We can brook no delay.

39:26.125 --> 39:29.208
Then I hereby declare

39:26.125 --> 39:29.208
this treaty in abeyance.

39:29.250 --> 39:32.917
Wait, negotiation

39:29.250 --> 39:32.917
is permissible...

39:37.667 --> 39:39.500
You enjoyed that.

Captain, they

39:47.291 --> 39:50.500
are hailing us.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.834
(<i> beeping continues</i> )

40:03.542 --> 40:05.458
Sir?

40:19.583 --> 40:22.667
On screen.

40:22.709 --> 40:28.083
You may have your three weeks,

40:22.709 --> 40:28.083
Picard, of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

40:28.125 --> 40:29.917
Thank you.

40:37.250 --> 40:40.083
Captain, we can do it.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.834
We can modify

40:40.125 --> 40:41.834
the transporters.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.083
Excellent.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.041
It'll take 15 years

40:44.083 --> 40:45.458
and a research

40:44.083 --> 40:45.458
team of 100...

40:45.500 --> 40:49.667
Mr. La Forge,

40:45.500 --> 40:49.667
I believe we will postpone.

40:49.709 --> 40:51.834
Yes, sir.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.000
Lieutenant Commander Data

40:58.250 --> 41:01.000
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

41:01.041 --> 41:03.375
I am preparing to leave

41:01.041 --> 41:03.375
Tau Cygna V

41:03.417 --> 41:05.750
and await

41:03.417 --> 41:05.750
rendezvous instructions.

41:05.792 --> 41:08.417
WORF:

41:05.792 --> 41:08.417
Acknowledged. Stand by.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.583
Hi.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.834
The evacuation plan

41:21.625 --> 41:23.834
is going well.

41:23.875 --> 41:26.542
When the ship arrives,

41:23.875 --> 41:26.542
we'll be ready to leave.

41:26.583 --> 41:27.875
You succeeded.

41:27.917 --> 41:29.417
I could not have succeeded

41:29.458 --> 41:31.500
without your support

41:29.458 --> 41:31.500
and insight.

41:31.542 --> 41:34.083
I am grateful

41:31.542 --> 41:34.083
for your assistance.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.375
Good.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.000
Then you won't forget me.

41:37.041 --> 41:38.917
I am incapable of forgetting.

41:38.959 --> 41:41.959
I will remember every detail

41:38.959 --> 41:41.959
of my visit here

41:42.000 --> 41:43.667
with perfect clarity.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.500
But nothing more?

41:46.542 --> 41:49.458
I do not understand.

41:52.792 --> 41:57.959
I guess what I really want

41:52.792 --> 41:57.959
to know is...

41:58.000 --> 42:01.709
do you have

41:58.000 --> 42:01.709
any feelings for me?

42:01.750 --> 42:07.333
I have no feelings of any kind.

42:07.375 --> 42:11.500
No, of course you don't.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.458
What was that for?

42:25.500 --> 42:28.667
You appeared to need it.

42:28.709 --> 42:34.375
So you saw that I was unhappy

42:34.417 --> 42:38.959
and did what you concluded

42:34.417 --> 42:38.959
would make me feel better?

42:42.834 --> 42:45.083
Rational to the last.

43:00.792 --> 43:03.583
Bye.

43:03.625 --> 43:04.875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

43:04.917 --> 43:06.000
Come.

43:06.041 --> 43:09.917
(<i> classical music playing</i> )

43:11.583 --> 43:12.667
Welcome home, Mr. Data.

43:12.709 --> 43:13.709
Well done.

43:13.750 --> 43:14.750
Thank you, sir.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.917
(<i> music continues</i> )

43:17.959 --> 43:20.375
The good doctor was kind

43:17.959 --> 43:20.375
enough to provide me

43:20.417 --> 43:22.542
with a recording

43:20.417 --> 43:22.542
of your concert.

43:22.583 --> 43:26.750
Your performance

43:22.583 --> 43:26.750
shows... feeling.

43:26.792 --> 43:30.208
As I have recently

43:26.792 --> 43:30.208
reminded others, sir

43:30.250 --> 43:32.291
I have no feeling.

43:32.333 --> 43:34.750
That's hard to believe.

43:34.792 --> 43:38.417
Your playing is

43:34.792 --> 43:38.417
quite beautiful.

43:38.458 --> 43:41.041
Strictly speaking, sir,

43:38.458 --> 43:41.041
it is not<i> my</i> playing.

43:41.083 --> 43:43.917
It is a precise imitation

43:41.083 --> 43:43.917
of the techniques

43:43.959 --> 43:46.458
of Jascha Heifetz

43:43.959 --> 43:46.458
and Trenka Bron-ken.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.542
Is there nothing of Data

43:49.500 --> 43:52.542
in what I'm hearing?

43:52.583 --> 43:55.458
You see, you chose

43:52.583 --> 43:55.458
the violinists.

43:55.500 --> 43:59.083
Heifetz and Bron-ken have

43:55.500 --> 43:59.083
radically different styles,

43:59.125 --> 44:01.125
different techniques,

44:01.166 --> 44:03.041
and yet you combine them

44:03.083 --> 44:04.792
successfully.

44:04.834 --> 44:10.792
I suppose I have learned

44:04.834 --> 44:10.792
to be creative, sir...

44:10.834 --> 44:12.792
when necessary.

44:15.375 --> 44:19.291
Mr. Data, I look forward

44:15.375 --> 44:19.291
to your next concert.
