<i>Previously on "Grand Crew"...</i>

00:06.136 --> 00:08.095
Do you want to be
my girlfriend?

00:08.095 --> 00:09.226
Yes.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.314
- Nice.
- But...

00:10.314 --> 00:13.100
- Oh, no.
- My visa just expired.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.927
So I have to go back
to Montreal next week.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.017
Who does your partner
secretly want to smash?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.149
- Ooh, Anthony.
- What?

00:19.149 --> 00:20.585
both: What?
- Z-what?

00:20.585 --> 00:22.283
No, no, no.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.328
Did you sleep with my brother?
And don't you lie to me.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.201
Yes, like,
three times last night.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.680
Didn't need to know
how many rounds you went.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.464
Just wanted a yes or no.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.248
<i>Crushes come and go.</i>

00:31.248 --> 00:32.815
The important thing is
that we can stay friends

00:32.815 --> 00:34.904
<i>because he never found out
about my feelings.</i>

00:39.996 --> 00:41.911
This is gonna sound crazy,

00:41.911 --> 00:44.522
but I realized
that I can stay in the country

00:44.522 --> 00:47.743
and--and we
could stay together if...

00:47.743 --> 00:50.050
we got married.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.834
Noah, will you marry me?

00:51.834 --> 00:54.358
Simone...

00:54.358 --> 00:56.186
I...

00:56.186 --> 00:58.928
I know pronounce you
man and wife.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.626

at the same time.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.840
Thanks, Doc.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.668
You know, their love story
only happened

01:43.668 --> 01:47.237
because my dad married my mom
to keep her in the country.

I know
what you guys are thinking,

02:40.290 --> 02:41.639
but this situation's different.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.554
If you say so.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.687
Seriously, I've given this
a ton of thought.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.080
I promise I'm not just getting
caught up in all the excitement

02:48.080 --> 02:49.821

02:50.996 --> 02:53.695
It's my fiancée.
Be right back.

02:53.695 --> 02:54.957
Hey, fiancée.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.915
He ain't changed,
and this will end badly.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.440
Boy is backsliding
like a busted BBL.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.963
We're not actually
gonna let him

03:00.963 --> 03:02.878
go through with this, are we?
- I mean, what can we do?

03:02.878 --> 03:05.228
My bro is a big old ho
for monogamy.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.534
He'll probably get cold feet.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.492
I got cold feet real bad
before I got married.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.667
Why did you go through
with it?

03:09.667 --> 03:10.973
Everybody
was already sitting down.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.193
I mean, you can't reason
with Noah's heart.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.020
That's what makes him so sweet

03:15.020 --> 03:17.284
and stupid and sad.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.809
Regardless,
someone needs to talk to Noah.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.945
- Why me?
- You're the married guy.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.686
You're right.

03:28.686 --> 03:32.560
I'll go and talk some sense
into him.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.257
All right, all right,
see you soon.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.825
Bye.
- Hey, hey, hey, Noah.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.696
Oh, Wyatt, just the man
I was looking for.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.482
- Hmm?
- I want to ask you something.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.398
We are getting
Noah married, y'all,

03:44.398 --> 03:46.530
and I'm gonna be his best man.
- What?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.445
- And it's in two hours.
- Z-what?

03:48.445 --> 03:50.012
It's the only appointment
we can get.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.143
If we don't get married today,

03:51.143 --> 03:52.536
then Simone
has to leave the country.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.277
The only problem is it's
all the way in Santa Monica,

03:54.277 --> 03:55.365
and I don't have my car.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.845
Same,
but that's not a problem.

03:56.845 --> 03:59.021
Sherm, you just started
your own car service, right?

03:59.021 --> 04:01.589
That's right--Jones Sons
is fully operational

04:01.589 --> 04:03.504
but much
too new and too expensive

04:03.504 --> 04:05.245
to be giving out
friends and family discounts.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.420
I'll pay you double.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.725
Well, let's get you married,
my guy.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.292
Noah, you know what would
also be fun?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.902
Is if we had, like,
a little reception

04:10.902 --> 04:12.295
for when you got back.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.601
Nicky, Fay, could y'all
put something together?

04:13.601 --> 04:15.385
I'm sure Noah
doesn't want any fuss.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.257
I love fuss.
I'm trying to get fussed up.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.389
Perfect.
This is your wedding day.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.477
Okay, everybody, let's go!

04:20.477 --> 04:21.783
Let's go, come on!

04:21.783 --> 04:23.654
Sherm, I need to talk to you
about music.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.874
You were supposed to
<i>stop</i> the wedding, Wyatt.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.658
Okay, while I don't
necessarily believe

04:27.658 --> 04:29.399
that he should be
getting married,

04:29.399 --> 04:31.183
I've never been
a best man before,

04:31.183 --> 04:33.751
and that is a responsibility
I don't take lightly.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.493
Don't worry, Nicky.
I'll go and change his mind.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.755
And when we get back,

04:37.755 --> 04:40.497
we can celebrate him
avoiding a disaster.

04:40.497 --> 04:44.240
Please, go stop my brother's
dreams from coming true!

04:46.286 --> 04:48.592
Now, this is a nice car.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.681
Oh, you are taking
this business seriously.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.509
Yeah, it's time for me
to figure out a career.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.555
I love people,
and I love driving.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.209
So I leased this here Caddy,
which I cannot afford,

04:57.209 --> 05:00.517
and started Jones Sons
Premium Luxury Car Service.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.607
"Established in 1882"?
Cars didn't even exist then.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.609
Yeah,
nothing on this card is true.

05:05.609 --> 05:06.915
It's true
if people believe it.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.743
That's the world
we live in now.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.919
So I created a whole persona.
I call him Sherman the Driver.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.399
Either way,
thank you so much

05:12.399 --> 05:13.617
for helping me
get to my wedding.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.053
You're a good friend.
- Yeah, Sherm.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.099
It's almost surprising
how supportive you're being.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.796
Let's make one thing clear--

05:18.796 --> 05:21.277
when I'm behind the wheel,
I'm not Sherm, the friend.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.800
I am Sherman the Driver.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.803
And at Jones Sons, our motto
is "We gon' get you there.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.284
"No matter where you're going
or why you're going to it,

05:28.284 --> 05:31.069
it don't matter, baby,
we got you!"

05:31.069 --> 05:32.375
That's a long-ass motto.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.638
Right, so as the best man,

05:34.638 --> 05:36.640
I have
one main responsibility--

05:36.640 --> 05:38.381
bachelor-party time!

05:38.381 --> 05:39.513
both: Hey!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.992
No drinking in the car.
- Wait, why?

05:40.992 --> 05:42.820
Because Sherman the Driver
is a deacon

05:42.820 --> 05:46.258
and does not partake
in such secular activities.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.174
Oh.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.484
What's up?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.660
Hey, Michael.
It's been a while.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.358
Yeah, it has been a while.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
What are you doing here,
Michael?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.883
Oh, well,
Kristen's out of town,

06:01.883 --> 06:03.493
so Wyatt asked me to bring
some stuff by for the party.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.016
Interesting--
Wyatt gets to take

06:05.016 --> 06:07.671
a luxury car ride, and
we get to do all the chores.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.021
It be like that sometimes.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.678
I'm happy to help.
Got more boxes in the car.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.550
So I'll be right back.
- Thanks so much.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.116
I'm actually gonna go
grab more glasses.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.422
Yeah, he's so helpful.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.817
Michael, Michael,
Michael, Michael.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.036
Um, what are you doing here?

06:25.036 --> 06:27.517
And that is a good question.
What are any of us doing here?

06:27.517 --> 06:29.563
I mean, we're born,
we live, we die,

06:29.563 --> 06:30.955
and for what?

06:30.955 --> 06:32.522
I'm trying to figure it out, honestly.

06:32.522 --> 06:33.741
Stop it.
You know what I mean.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.612
All right, don't worry.
It's cool.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.875
Nobody's gonna find out
that I'm your boyfriend.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.573
- Shh!
- Don't shush your boyfriend.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.226
That's not cool.
- You are causing a scene.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.532
I'm not making a scene.
You're making a scene.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.795
Hey, you guys need
an extra hand?

06:44.795 --> 06:45.883
- No, we cool.
- No.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.450
- We're good.
- No, we got this.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.930
- You good?
- I'm great.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.410
Great.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.412
Yeah, fantastic.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.982
Hey, you look as beautiful
as the day I met you...

06:57.982 --> 07:00.550
three weeks ago.
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

07:00.550 --> 07:02.291
<i>And you look so handsome.</i>

07:02.291 --> 07:03.727
<i>Okay, so I'm already here,</i>

07:03.727 --> 07:05.294
<i>because my friend Courtney
lives in El Segundo</i>

07:05.294 --> 07:06.426
<i>and gave me a ride.</i>

07:06.426 --> 07:07.383
<i>How far out are you?</i>

07:07.383 --> 07:08.602
Oh, we should get there

07:08.602 --> 07:10.081
with time to spare--
about, like, 30 minutes.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.432
<i>Wonderful.
See you soon, fiancé!</i>

07:12.432 --> 07:13.650
See you soon, fiancée!

07:15.086 --> 07:19.177
Ah, that was my fiancée.
- I gathered as much.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.788
So, Noah, as an accountant,

07:20.788 --> 07:22.572
I just want to make sure
that you've thought

07:22.572 --> 07:24.182
about the financial implications

07:24.182 --> 07:26.358
of getting married--
it can be a real challenge.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.100
But doesn't it also come
with a bunch of tax advantages?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.146
- Uh, yeah, but, you know--
- Listen, Noah's right.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.496
Kristen and I
have benefitted tremendously--

07:33.496 --> 07:35.411
lower tax bracket,
better deductions--

07:35.411 --> 07:36.760
Shut up!

07:36.760 --> 07:38.762
Sherm, you agree, right?

07:38.762 --> 07:40.503
Sorry, brother--
Sherman the Driver

07:40.503 --> 07:43.071
only engages
in harmless small talk.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.943
Ooh, a TGI Fridays.
Have y'all ever been there?

07:45.943 --> 07:48.119
My son just loves
their onion rings.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.470
- But you don't have a son.
- But Sherman the Driver does.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.254
And he's going to the NBA.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.604
Hey, yo, what's going on
with all this traffic?

07:54.604 --> 07:56.345
They're calling it
the "Car-pocalypse."

07:56.345 --> 07:57.607
<i>What?</i>

07:57.607 --> 07:59.391
No, w-we have to get
to Santa Monica

07:59.391 --> 08:01.611
in under an hour and a half.
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.483
Not a problem.
I know all the best shortcuts.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.267
Just gonna turn off right here.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.486
Don't worry.
I got you.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.315
all: Oh!

08:10.315 --> 08:11.491
Oh, damn.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.927
I don't got you.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.280
I didn't see him.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.760
He just came out of nowhere
like a maniac.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.935
Sherm, I am very sorry
about your car,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.502
but please resolve
this quickly.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.068
We don't have a lot of time.
- Don't worry, sir.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.330
I can be calm and reasonable.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.463
Uh-huh.
Shouldn't be no issue, baby.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.421
Oh, my neck!

08:29.421 --> 08:30.510
Hold up.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.946
Ron Ron?
- Sherm?

08:31.946 --> 08:34.557
Man, what the hell
are you doing here?

08:34.557 --> 08:36.080
This is my shortcut, man!

08:36.080 --> 08:38.039
I'm the one that put you
onto this shortcut, man!

08:38.039 --> 08:39.562
You did not put me
onto this shortcut.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.346
I put you onto this shortcut.

08:41.346 --> 08:42.783
Oh, you gonna pay for this.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.480
Oh, I'm done paying you, man.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.786
Oh, then I'ma sue
your broke ass.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.352
Sue these
knuckle balls, fool.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.876
Oh, so you want
to boogie-bop?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.747
Yeah.
So let's bop the boogie, then.

08:50.747 --> 08:53.010
Oh, oh, oh.
- Stop this, okay?

08:53.010 --> 08:55.535
Just call Triple-A.
It'll be a quick fix.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.450
Ooh, yeah.
This is gonna take forever.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.452
I'm gonna have to tow 'em both
to the shop.

09:00.452 --> 09:01.976
- No!
- Oh, man!

09:01.976 --> 09:03.891
Time is running
out--we got to move.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.240
Are you sure
you can't reschedule?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.850
No, if we don't get
the certificate stamped

09:06.850 --> 09:08.548
with today's date,
Simone is gonna get deported.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.593
First the heavy traffic,
then the accident.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.552
Seems like the universe
is sending you a sign.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.902
Oh, stop putting words
in the universe's mouth.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.602
The universe just told me
that you are wrong.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.125
There's a train stop!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.823
Everybody, come on, let's go.
We're taking the Metro.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.520
Wait! Where do you think
you're going?

09:24.520 --> 09:26.043
I need your
insurance information.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.741
I'm going to the chapel.
The homey's getting married!

09:27.741 --> 09:29.525
So you think you can just dip
without paying for my damages?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.961
We all going to the chapel.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.224
Nah, that's not "chappening."
You're not invited.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.009
You're invited
to this beatdown.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.489
Everybody is invited
if we just move!

09:39.666 --> 09:41.668
Wyatt texted that Noah likes
a red blend

09:41.668 --> 09:43.974
with notes of leather
and cherries.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.194
- Mm.
- Mm.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.631
Not tasting leather.
I'm getting more velvet.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.329
Interesting, 'cause
I'm getting hints of denim.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.896
- Mm.
- Khakis.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.681
- Mm?
- I mean, I'm just--

09:54.681 --> 09:56.683
I don't really know--
I don't know.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.380
Is wine supposed to taste
like pants?

09:58.380 --> 10:00.774
This isn't the one.
I'm gonna go get more bottles.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.907
So how long
are you staying here?

10:03.907 --> 10:05.561
I don't know--I guess
until I want to go home,

10:05.561 --> 10:06.823
play video games, smoke weed.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
Michael, I'm not ready
to tell my friends

10:08.782 --> 10:10.435
that you are my--
- Boyfriend?

10:10.435 --> 10:11.654
Keep your voice down.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.177
I thought you liked it
when I made noise.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.701
Oh, don't
make this conversation sexy.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
Oh, that's gonna be hard
to do with your sexy voice.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.095
- You're so annoying.
- Oh, and you're so beautiful.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.141
- I hate you.
- You want to get out of here?

10:20.141 --> 10:21.577
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.883
Okay.
Oh, boy...

10:22.883 --> 10:26.234
I got some leather wine...

10:30.717 --> 10:33.328
Okay, how's this?

10:33.328 --> 10:34.634
I do.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.592
No, that's, like--
- A little serious, yeah.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.115
I do?
Nah, I'm questioning it.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.726
- You can't ask a question.
- Can't be a question, yeah.

10:39.726 --> 10:46.689
I do.
I do.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.126
<i>Obviously not.</i>

10:49.126 --> 10:51.868
<i>I think he's making a mistake,
but I'm his best man.</i>

10:51.868 --> 10:54.175
I do.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.091
What--what are y'all so busy
doing on your phones?

10:57.091 --> 11:01.312
Oh, just Kristen
and marriage stuff.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.445
Anyway, let's keep
your bachelor party going.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.881
- Really?
- Really?

11:04.881 --> 11:08.102
Excuse me, everyone.
My friend is getting married.

11:08.102 --> 11:11.758
And we want to celebrate
his last few moments

11:11.758 --> 11:15.283
as a single man,
so who's down to party?

11:15.283 --> 11:16.806
I love this!

11:16.806 --> 11:19.069
I don't think these strangers
are in the mood to party

11:19.069 --> 11:20.941
with a bunch of strangers--
- I got a boom box.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.595
- I got peppermints.
- I've got a ton of cocaine.

11:23.595 --> 11:26.729
Whoa, uh,
I think we're good on that,

11:26.729 --> 11:28.992
but thank you
for your enthusiasm.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.869
Bachelor party!
Yeah!

11:35.869 --> 11:37.392
<i>♪ Laugh to the bank,
I'm like, "Ha ha" ♪</i>

11:37.392 --> 11:39.002
<i>♪ Dada, what's she saying?
I heard "blah-blah" ♪</i>

11:39.002 --> 11:40.787

11:50.448 --> 11:52.624
Turn me up, YC!

11:55.018 --> 11:57.978
Nicky, Michael, this is Amir,
the owner of the bar.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.849
- Oh, hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.546
So I heard
you're throwing a party.

12:01.546 --> 12:02.939
Let me show you
our private event space.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.028
- Oh, yeah. Cool.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.727
Cool.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.339
Okay, what's this?

12:11.339 --> 12:12.601
Okay!

12:12.601 --> 12:13.907
Oh, this is like some
Scooby-Doo stuff.

12:13.907 --> 12:14.951
Ruh-oh!

12:16.823 --> 12:19.216
Oh! This is nice.
- Yeah, okay.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.783
I didn't know
this was back here.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.306
Yeah, we don't really
advertise it.

12:22.306 --> 12:26.615
Ah, why would anyone keep
such a good thing a secret?

12:26.615 --> 12:31.011
Maybe he's keeping the bar
a secret because it's special

12:31.011 --> 12:33.187
and Amir's just being
protective of it.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.928
Mm, that sounds like
a fake excuse.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.930
Well, I mean,
sometimes I do feel guilty.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.759
Maybe I should be more public
about this spot.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.283
No, Amir,
this is a secret bar.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.852
Secrets can be fun and sexy.
- Mm, that's true, too.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.854
But what about
the bar's feelings?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.072
I'm sorry.
What?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.770
Maybe
the secret bar's feelings

12:50.770 --> 12:52.597
are their own fault
and not Amir's.

12:52.597 --> 12:55.687
- Huh?
- Well, maybe Amir is selfish.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.037
Hey.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.429
I think the secret bar's
being immature,

12:58.429 --> 12:59.866
and that's why it's a secret
in the first place.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.215
Well, then
I guess we're done here.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.782
Good luck finding a new bar.
- Hmm.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.827
Uh, I-I'm sorry.
What just happened?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.873
I don't know.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.658
Okay, guys,
so we only have one stop left.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.529
But let me just say
that was hands down

13:11.529 --> 13:13.270
the best half-hour
bachelor party

13:13.270 --> 13:15.055
on public transit
that anyone's ever had.

13:15.055 --> 13:18.580
Right? And it even got
Sherm and Ron Ron to make up.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.842
See? That's why you my guy.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.410
Nah, that's why you
<i>my</i> guy, man!

13:22.410 --> 13:23.890
<i>Attention, passengers--</i>

13:23.890 --> 13:25.805
<i>we are having technical
difficulties on the train.</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:28.024
<i>This is now the last stop.</i>
- Wait, what?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.330
<i>I said we are having</i>

13:29.330 --> 13:31.158
<i>technical difficulties
on the train.</i>

13:31.158 --> 13:32.768
<i>I've had a long-ass day.
Just get off.</i>

13:38.426 --> 13:39.906
I can't believe this.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.777
We don't have time to get there
on foot.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.257
What's the universe
saying now?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.259
It's saying you need to chill
with all the negativity.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.608
Look, I'm sorry

13:46.608 --> 13:48.349
that I'm the only one
keeping it real with you.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.785
What's that mean?

13:49.785 --> 13:51.178
It means you're making
a mistake, Noah.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.180
Even your best man agrees.
Tell him.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.573
- Hey!
- Wow. Really, Wyatt?

13:55.573 --> 13:57.488
Okay, if you're gonna be mad
at anybody, be mad at Sherm,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.186
because he's the one
who got into the accident.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.144
Hey, I tried
to drive you there.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.885
That was Sherman the Driver.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.148
What does Sherm,
my friend, think?

14:05.148 --> 14:07.716
And don't lie.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.240
I mean...

14:10.240 --> 14:12.460
he thinks you're nuts.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.809
Man.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.985
But, Noah!
Noah!

14:15.985 --> 14:17.857
Sherman the Driver
appreciates your business.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.253
<i>Hey, this is Simone's phone.</i>

14:23.253 --> 14:24.864
<i>Leave a message.</i>

14:24.864 --> 14:28.432
Hey, uh, I tried calling you
a couple times.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.000
I'm not gonna be able
to make it.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.176
It's a long story,
but I don't know.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.830
Maybe this is just
the universe's way

14:34.830 --> 14:37.572
of trying to give us a sign.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.182
I'm sorry.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.410
Hey, man.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.325
Look, I know
you're upset with us,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.370
but we also know
how you can get,

14:53.370 --> 14:54.806
and we were just trying
to look out.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.460
No.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.334
You just weren't
being good friends.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.988
You're supposed to have my back

15:01.988 --> 15:04.425
even when it seems
like it's crazy.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.644
Anthony, remember
you wanted to write that play

15:06.644 --> 15:08.951
about Tax Day called
"April 15th: The Musical"?

15:08.951 --> 15:10.474
Then I read all 200 pages,

15:10.474 --> 15:11.954
and it was just
a whole bunch of accountants

15:11.954 --> 15:13.477
screaming about how
the numbers didn't add up.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.349
And, Wyatt,
remember that photo shoot

15:15.349 --> 15:16.916
where you had me
completely covered in mud?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.656
I still don't even know what
that photo shoot was about,

15:18.656 --> 15:21.398
but I was down.
- Yeah.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.139
And, Sherm,
remember you wanted to start

15:23.139 --> 15:24.749
that Black-owned
toilet-paper company?

15:24.749 --> 15:27.448
- FUBU Boo Boo.
- That was crazy.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.885
But I supported you.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.278
And, Ron Ron...

15:33.454 --> 15:34.977
I mean, I really don't know you
all that well,

15:34.977 --> 15:36.109
but I'm sure you got, like,

15:36.109 --> 15:37.284
some weird stuff
you be getting into.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.938
I definitely do, man.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.852
Look, the crazy thing
about all this is that

15:40.852 --> 15:43.638
I actually
thought this through.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.554
None of it even matters now.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.035
Let's just go back east.
- Nah, that's not happening.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.863
Wow. You're gonna stop me
from going home, too?

15:51.863 --> 15:54.997
Man, y'all are buggin'.
- No, you were right.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.305
We should've had your back.
So we're gonna get you married.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.350
That's right.
We are.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.699
Yeah.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.397
And how are
we gonna do that exactly?

16:03.397 --> 16:05.181
Because we do not have
the necessary resources.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.053
I have an idea.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.927
Anthony, I had
no idea your aunt was a EMT.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.495
That's right--
best auntie in the world!

16:14.495 --> 16:16.366
Ain't that right, Auntie Jane?

16:16.366 --> 16:17.889
That's right.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.805
So maybe
you should call more often.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.198
I'm busy.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.331
Not too busy
to call your Auntie Deb.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.550
Yeah, she told me y'all talk.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.378
We really appreciate
your help!

16:28.378 --> 16:30.076
Of course!

16:30.076 --> 16:33.644
I had to because you were all
injured from your car accident.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.386
Right?
all: Yes, Auntie Jane.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.391
I got to tell you something

16:41.391 --> 16:43.393
that's been really hard
for me, Fay.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.439
- Okay.
- Okay, how do I start?

16:45.439 --> 16:47.658
It's--um, it is
kind of like--

16:47.658 --> 16:48.746
So--

16:48.746 --> 16:50.879
Okay, when a man and a woman--

16:50.879 --> 16:52.402
Oh, is this about you
dating Michael?

16:52.402 --> 16:53.882
You witch.
How did you know?

16:53.882 --> 16:55.188
Because you're my girl.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.059
And just like you knew
when I liked Anthony.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.452
Mm.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.931
Also, you guys have been
acting so weird all day,

16:59.931 --> 17:01.020
it was pretty obvious.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.543
Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.936
I'm just, like, not used
to being someone's girlfriend.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.068
Hmm.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.591
We broke up,
so it doesn't matter.

17:07.591 --> 17:10.464
- Why? You clearly like him.
- I do.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.553
But, like, what
if it doesn't work out?

17:12.553 --> 17:14.555
Well, then we just
come back here

17:14.555 --> 17:16.296
to get drunk and talk trash.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.906
That's nice.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.429
- Can I have that one?
- You can.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.604
Thank you.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.085
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.869
All right, this is as far
as I can take you.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.611
Any further, and these
beach-boy EMTs'll be on my ass.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.004
It's three blocks that way.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.571
We got two minutes, y'all.
Let's roll!

17:30.571 --> 17:32.747
Oh, hold on! Aren't y'all
forgetting something?

17:32.747 --> 17:33.965
all:
Thanks, Auntie Jane!

17:33.965 --> 17:36.533
And?

17:36.533 --> 17:38.448
- Mwah!
- That's better.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.797
All right, you go on ahead

17:39.797 --> 17:41.147
and marry
your little girlfriend-wife.

No.
It's too late.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.799
I'm sorry, Noah.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.323
I really am.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.501
You know, I'm not even
that bummed about the wedding.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.113
If I'm being honest,
I'm just bummed

18:34.113 --> 18:38.073
that it means this is the end
for Simone and I.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.162
Noah?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.947
Simone?

18:42.947 --> 18:45.863
Oh!

18:45.863 --> 18:48.431
Oh, I am so sorry I was late.

18:48.431 --> 18:52.305
Noah, it's okay, it's okay.
I have good news.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.916
I can stay in the country.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.526
Seriously? Wha--

18:56.526 --> 18:58.398
When I got your message,
I didn't know what to do,

18:58.398 --> 19:00.269
but then my friend Courtney
offered to help,

19:00.269 --> 19:01.966
so we got married instead.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.533
Oh, snap.
Well, that's great.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.014
Well, where's Courtney?
I can't wait to thank her.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.450
Hey, guys.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.017
Hey.
What's up, man?

19:09.017 --> 19:10.366
Excuse us for a second.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.455
Uh, Simone, where's Courtney?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.718
Noah, this is Courtney.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.198
Huh?

19:18.679 --> 19:20.768
- Hey, Michael, can we talk?
- Nah, I'm good.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.161
- Michael, please.
- Nah.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.205
- Michael.
- Nah.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.206
- Michael, come on.
- Nah.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.294
- Michael, please.
- Nah.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.991
I want us to be together.

19:26.991 --> 19:30.081
- Excuse me?
- And I want people to know.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.823
I wasn't ready to own it,
but I'm--I'm ready now.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.825
I want you to go to the party
with me as my boyfriend.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.611
And we can hold hands,
share snacks,

19:37.611 --> 19:39.090
tell inside jokes.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.223
I don't know what couples do,
but all of that stuff.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.833
- You being serious?
- Yes.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.184
Okay, well, that's
all I wanted to hear.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.663
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.361
- Aw.
- Mm.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.407
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

19:51.407 --> 19:53.148
Simone gets to stay
in the country,

19:53.148 --> 19:57.370
so you guys are still together,
but that's her husband?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.676
Yeah. Courtney's
my girlfriend's husband.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.504
Uh, but only on paper.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.114
And now
we get to stay together.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.072
Yeah, we do.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.160
Where's Nicky?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.379
Sorry we're late.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.642
"We"?

20:08.642 --> 20:10.296
Why y'all holding hands?

20:13.037 --> 20:14.343
Why y'all kissing?

20:14.343 --> 20:15.866
Nicky, that's my brother!

20:15.866 --> 20:18.042
Why are y'all holding hands
and kissing?

20:18.042 --> 20:20.958
Someone help me understand,
please!

20:20.958 --> 20:22.221
Yeah.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.229
Looks like everything worked
out with Noah and Simone.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.665
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.014
I have absolutely zero doubt

20:33.014 --> 20:34.668
things will sort themselves
out in the end.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.713
Weren't you on a mission
to stop the whole thing?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.367
No, I was on a mission
to be a good friend...

20:38.367 --> 20:39.890
Oh, okay.

20:39.890 --> 20:44.068
Which I failed miserably at
at first, but we're back.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.679
Mm.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.118
I'm sorry. This is Talia.
I should take this.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.598
You should take it.
both: Yeah.

20:51.598 --> 20:54.383
Um, just gonna...

20:54.383 --> 20:56.559
Cool.
- Cool.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.865
So this is the first time
we've both been

20:57.865 --> 20:59.258
in a relationship
at the same time.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.563
I know.
Wild, right?

21:00.563 --> 21:02.478
I'm someone's girlfriend,

21:02.478 --> 21:04.611
and you're
someone's wife's boyfriend.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.091
Okay, well, you're our
friend's brother's girlfriend.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.832
Okay, well, mine's normal,
and yours is weird.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.618
- Yeah, I know.
- Mm-hmm.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.750
- But I'm so happy.
- Aw.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.318
Ah! Oh!

21:16.318 --> 21:19.930
He happy, he happy!
Ow, ow!

21:19.930 --> 21:21.323
Feelin' good.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.369
<i>Yah.</i>

21:23.369 --> 21:25.458
<i>- Not a doctor.</i>
- Shh.
