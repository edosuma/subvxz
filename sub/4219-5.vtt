WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:03.252
Whoa, Darryl? Just give me the gun.

00:03.379 --> 00:05.171
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:05.297 --> 00:08.508
If you had stepped back like I asked,
Darryl might still be alive.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.343
Do not talk to me.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.764
You're the rat. You have been feeding
information to McLeod this entire time.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.266
Ms. McLeod has been making
insinuations about me,

00:17.393 --> 00:19.394
how I run my firehouse,
which is not her job.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.606
It's about House 51. Is it a problem
house or is there a problem chief?

00:25.109 --> 00:27.110
Get back!

00:27.945 --> 00:31.155
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave for her.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.323
Mama!

00:32.449 --> 00:34.117
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.788
Gabby, will you just listen?

00:38.914 --> 00:41.708
You wasted enough of my time.
Keep calling me, I'm calling the cops.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.919
There's something you need to know
about this Jay guy.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.254
You're a cop?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.683
- Good morning.
- I'll say.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

01:02.646 --> 01:03.855
Putting on a shirt.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.398
No, you're not.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.868
We got to be really careful
going forward. OK?

01:17.870 --> 01:19.162
Oh, yeah.

01:22.541 --> 01:27.587
I'm like a hostile witness now,
or what's the deal?

01:34.803 --> 01:37.472
I'm just saying,
don't tell anyone, all right?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.598
Until we make the pinch,

01:38.724 --> 01:40.808
because if Arthur finds
out I'm a cop then...

01:42.186 --> 01:43.519
I'm a dead cop.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.982
Do you have a handle on this?

01:48.984 --> 01:49.984
Yes.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.696
Then that's all I need to hear.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.667
Hello?

02:08.378 --> 02:09.754
Hey, Amy.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.881
Yeah. What party?

02:13.091 --> 02:15.259
Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember that.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.261
Yeah, I'll be there.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.223
OK. Yeah, me too.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.516
OK, bye.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.281
What're you doing?

02:38.075 --> 02:39.325
I live here.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.454
Town Lounge.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.998
Yeah. We did a lot of tequila shots.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.043
- Correct.
- There was a cab ride.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.425
- What's with the camera?
- Relax. I'm a photographer.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.305
I'm just going to grab my stuff here.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.142
Um, well, I just, you know...

03:05.269 --> 03:07.270
It was nice meeting you.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.609
Peace.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.378
Hey. Sorry I'm late. Decided to walk.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.131
Oh, yeah?

03:35.257 --> 03:38.676
Could I get a coffee, please?
Black, no sugar? Thanks.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.013
So, what ever happened
between you and Beth?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.014
You never told me.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.515
Oh, well...

03:44.641 --> 03:46.851
She heard all my stories
and I heard all of hers.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.936
Basic seven year itch
type of thing.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.439
Look, I'm not here for that, OK?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.609
When Boden and I were on Squad together
over at the 35,

03:54.735 --> 03:55.902
we used to have this chief

03:56.028 --> 03:59.155
who liked to help himself
to certain keepsakes

03:59.281 --> 04:00.823
on some of the calls we went on.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.993
So, of course Dwyer gets investigated

04:04.119 --> 04:07.204
and everybody at the house,
we don't know what to do.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.998
And it was Boden,

04:09.124 --> 04:10.333
the old Navy man, who said,

04:10.459 --> 04:11.959
"Don't go down with the Captain.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.419
"Stay with the ship."

04:13.962 --> 04:15.254
And he was right.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.007
Why are you telling me this?

04:19.301 --> 04:20.843
I'm hearing from a lot of sources

04:20.969 --> 04:23.179
that Boden's got
one foot on a banana peel.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.141
You're going to need
to make a choice.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.235
Chief, please.
Come in. Have a seat.

04:48.956 --> 04:55.252
The financial ramifications of the
Hadley arsons are an embarrassment,

04:55.379 --> 04:58.297
not to mention the fact that you are
the only chief so far

04:58.423 --> 05:02.093
who has yet to implement
the Wellness Program into your house.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.347
And as far as our interaction is
concerned,

05:06.473 --> 05:09.183
I mean, we're basically at
the broken record stage, aren't we?

05:10.060 --> 05:14.689
So why don't we get
solution-minded, yeah?

05:16.817 --> 05:20.778
I was able to cobble
together a very attractive

05:20.904 --> 05:22.488
early retirement package for you.

05:24.241 --> 05:28.369
The state believes that Firehouse 51
is worth saving.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.915
Sadly it's your leadership
that we're unhappy with.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.504
So my offer would save
a stain on your record

05:38.630 --> 05:40.464
and allow you to work private sector.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.092
We will need your decision by Friday.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.722
I have one now.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.144
Kiss my ass.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.166
I haven't seen Boden like that
since Shonda left him.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.003
Yeah, he's dealing
with a lot right now.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.005
He'll get through it, though.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.466
He was asking me
about Boden last week.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.842
What happened with
him and Benny

06:24.968 --> 06:27.470
and do we ever socialize,
just crap like that.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.098
Of course, I was chatting him up,
which really pisses me off.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.686
Do I still have to cook for him?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.536
Good time last night?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.623
Yeah. Had a blast.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.875
I texted you a couple of times.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.420
I'm sorry, I was at Amy's.
I was... I was...

07:01.546 --> 07:02.880
I was a little drunk.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.840
Shay, you can do your thing.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.842
That's rule number one,
if I'm not mistaken.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.344
But I don't want to
wake up wondering

07:08.470 --> 07:09.970
if you wrapped
your car around a tree.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.180
I get it.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.480
I wouldn't mind hearing
a compelling reason

07:19.606 --> 07:22.149
why you've been reporting back
to McLeod on this house.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.823
To the extent that you're due one,
I was instructed to.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.243
Under threat of what?
What does she have over you?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.203
If there's something, tell me.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.792
How about because they felt
there was a problem with this house

07:39.918 --> 07:42.545
and they needed help in determining
what that problem was?

07:42.671 --> 07:45.381
How about because I take my job
seriously?

07:45.507 --> 07:48.843
See, I'm thinking more
it's because you're a soft-ass fireman

07:48.969 --> 07:51.178
who has to pull magic tricks
to survive on this job.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.764
- I'm done talking to you.
- You need to find a new house.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.057
Oh, man!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.560
Just like you did with Hadley. Right?

07:57.686 --> 08:01.230
Bounce the guy out who doesn't fit
into the cool kids' club.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.941
Well, too bad.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.027
We're the same rank, Matt.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.573
I'm not some ham and egger
you can just kick to the curb.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.824
I'm not going anywhere

08:11.950 --> 08:15.202
and you better keep your men in line
or McLeod will hear about it.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.751
Arthur's been shaking down businesses,

08:22.878 --> 08:24.295
but they're close to making a... A...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.088
- Pinch.
- Right.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.215
Meantime, we just gotta
keep paying Arthur money,

08:28.341 --> 08:29.592
act like we don't know anything.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.802
- For how long?
- Till the next pinch.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.306
This is coming from who?

08:36.141 --> 08:38.058
Antonio. I saw him this morning.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.144
I thought you said
he and Laura and the kids

08:40.270 --> 08:42.479
were at her parents' house in Wisconsin.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.481
Yeah. We, uh... We Skyped.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.322
OK, so Antonio's got a handle on this,

08:51.448 --> 08:52.573
is what you're saying.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.699
Yes.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.579
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.332
a tree collapse,
537 Aberdeen Street.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.797
Wow.

09:16.014 --> 09:16.931
Help!

09:18.391 --> 09:19.475
Help!

09:20.477 --> 09:22.019
Up here, guys! Up here!

09:22.687 --> 09:25.147
We got at least one victim
on the top floor.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.858
The tree has collapsed
two of the main beams.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.610
We need to limit
the amount of impact load.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.279
Two recon teams? We keep them small?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.407
Clarke and Otis, we go up the 35 foot
ladder to the attic apartment.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.910
- Herrmann and Cruz...
- My baby! He's in his crib!

09:38.036 --> 09:40.037
- In the second floor apartment!
- Anybody with him?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.914
No, the tree came
right through our wall.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.625
- Oh, my God!
- We're going to get him.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.878
Mills, 20-foot ladder, second floor,
we got a baby trapped up there.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.839
- Chief, we need a medic.
- Structure's not gonna last long. Go.

09:50.966 --> 09:54.426
Dawson, Shay, we have a baby
trapped on the second floor.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.057
- You take it.
- I'm good.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.144
I got the second floor,
you do the attic.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.896
Need a medic in the attic.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.106
On my way, Casey.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.652
Please help my wife!

10:11.778 --> 10:14.238
Stand back.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.864
Stay out of the way.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.992
- What's her name?
- Emily.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.964
I got eyes on him.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.384
There's about, uh, four feet
between the tree and his crib.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.802
Careful with that debris.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.887
Emily, can you breathe
through your nose OK?

10:39.014 --> 10:41.223
Squeeze my hand once
for yes, twice for no.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.143
OK.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.147
Sweetie, I think your jaw's broken,
so don't try to talk.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.524
And plus, you kind of
got this tree in the way.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.125
Mouch, Otis, we gotta get
the husband outta here,

11:08.251 --> 11:09.460
this floor's gonna give!

11:09.586 --> 11:10.753
All right, come on, sir.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.421
Here we go.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.841
Sweetie, are you allergic
to any meds?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.177
OK. Give me this arm.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.596
All right, I'm going to give you this
to help with the pain.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.140
It's also going to make you
higher than a freakin' kite.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.564
Last one. Watch your eyes!

11:34.861 --> 11:36.028
I got you.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.083
Uh, baby's OK, Chief.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.383
Let's get outta here.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.260
Close your eyes.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.519
You're going to be OK.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.435
Hey! Plans Friday night?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.437
Firing off some campaign tweets.
What do you got?

12:51.563 --> 12:54.148
A little, uh, surprise shindig
at the crib.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.442
You know, for Shay,
cheer her up a little bit.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.111
Me and her, we've gotten kind of tight.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.447
And, uh, got to look out for my girl.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.616
Yeah, huh?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.786
Let's keep this intimate, all right?
Exclusive.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.039
Listen up, everybody.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.585
We've put off the mandated
Wellness Program for long enough.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.628
Each member of the house
is required to have

13:16.754 --> 13:18.797
a physical examination
by the end of shift.

13:18.923 --> 13:23.886
Might that be considered a risk, Chief,
in light of the scrutiny on our house?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.053
Speak for yourself, Mouch.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.389
I'm just saying, a fitness test?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.684
Does CPD get a driving test?
It's offensive.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.853
First thing I do away with when I'm
elected.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.230
It needs to be done today!

13:41.488 --> 13:42.821
Now...

13:46.284 --> 13:48.827
I am sure you will all pass
with flying colors.

13:52.707 --> 13:53.790
God.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.095
Um, so I'll start with Cruz,
you do Dawson?

14:07.222 --> 14:10.307
You know what? Why don't you do Dawson
and I'll do Cruz?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.393
Wait, uh...

14:21.110 --> 14:24.154
She's coming for me, guys.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.574
- We dig our heels in, Chief.
- This is not your fight.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.243
The hell it isn't.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.162
First thing, we got to get
Spellman out of here.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.289
You run him out,

14:34.415 --> 14:36.416
you'd be doing the same thing
she's trying to do to me.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.002
Chief, he's ratting you out.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.381
Don't roll over for these clowns.
This is your house.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.507
Defend it.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.430
Ooh. Relax your grip.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.691
So, uh, blood draw, BP,
height, weight, that's it?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.111
And a stool sample.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.531
Oh, no, they're out of their minds if
they think I'm actually going to give...

15:07.657 --> 15:09.032
Are you messing with me?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.534
Yes.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.869
You are such a sly dog, Mills.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.955
Am I?

15:15.081 --> 15:17.249
You come in here with, like,
this whole Clark Kent thing,

15:17.375 --> 15:18.959
and behind all that's just a pure
rascal.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.460
I miss that.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.427
How are things with Isabella?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.055
Good. Fun.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.349
I'm glad.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.568
You know, two people break up,

15:45.737 --> 15:47.404
walk away from each other.
That's normal.

15:48.448 --> 15:53.035
But you and I, we're friends first.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.498
We'll get back there one day.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.586
I'd like that.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.150
Wait, so what kind of party?

16:25.276 --> 16:27.778
Shh! We'll cook up some apps,
throw back some brewskies,

16:27.904 --> 16:30.989
and that courtyard area is awesome at
night. Just keep it on the QT.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.283
Is Severide going to bring Zoya?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.662
I am humbled, and really jazzed,

16:36.788 --> 16:39.498
as I unveil to you the official

16:39.624 --> 16:42.668
Randall McHolland for Union President
campaign poster.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.212
Atta girl!

16:45.755 --> 16:47.756
Now is that the face
of a winner or what?

16:47.882 --> 16:50.342
Man, you can do anything
with a computer these days.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.468
You're a genius.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.513
All I ask, no curly
mustaches please,

16:54.639 --> 16:56.181
or the blacked-out tooth.

16:56.307 --> 17:01.186
And thank you, Isabella,
for all of your vision and tweeting.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.438
We're taking Sullivan down.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.107
Yeah!

17:08.319 --> 17:09.820
So are we on for tonight?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.780
Absolutely.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.116
Uh, Isabella, do you have a sec?

17:14.242 --> 17:17.869
Heather took the plea deal right away,
so the whole thing got fast-tracked.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.914
And she didn't fight it because
she completely took responsibility

17:21.040 --> 17:22.958
for what she did,
and she didn't want to

17:23.084 --> 17:25.335
risk being away from her boys
for, like, 10 years.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.004
- How long did she get?
- 15 months.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.048
And she's serving it at MCC.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.176
But I'm not sure her lawyer took
into account

17:33.302 --> 17:37.264
that Heather's husband,
he was a fireman here in this house.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.599
He died on the job.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.311
And maybe there's a way
to present that to the court

17:43.438 --> 17:45.439
and get her
into a minimum security facility

17:45.565 --> 17:47.899
so she could spend
more time with her kids.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.569
I'm just trying all my options here.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.404
Tell you what,
let me make some calls.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.573
I have some friends
at the State's Attorney's Office.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.160
Anything you can do. Thank you.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.667
Hold that.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.179
You already took my blood pressure.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.562
Huh. Know what? You're done.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.610
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

18:31.736 --> 18:34.446
an impalement,
514 Sanborn Street.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.743
What happened?

18:39.869 --> 18:42.329
He slipped pushing a rototiller
and he got his leg stuck inside.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.206
All right, give me some room.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.211
You got to get it out,
please get me out!

18:49.337 --> 18:51.296
We pull the blades,
he'll bleed out.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.132
- Let's disassemble it.
- Guys, grab us a tool bag.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.134
Pulse is weak.
We've got to stabilize him.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.677
You're gonna be OK.
You need to...

18:57.804 --> 18:58.762
The mask in my embo bag.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.183
Push to 15 liters.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.069
Starting an IV.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.155
Heart rate's stable.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.417
Chief, uh, he's missing four toes.
I couldn't find them anywhere.

19:29.544 --> 19:32.295
Get the thermal imaging camera
and grab some baggies.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.049
- He's crashing!
- Pass me the intubation kit.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.217
I got it.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.247
Push the epi.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.962
OK, stop compressions.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.841
We got a pulse.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.640
All right, backward!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.148
You don't want to forget these.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.566
Yeah.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.459
120 over 80. Healthy as a horse.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.586
I remember your first shift, Mills.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.671
I also remember thinking,

20:56.797 --> 21:00.926
"There's no way this kid's as good
as his dad. Job's changed too much."

21:01.761 --> 21:03.011
But you are as good.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.598
If not better.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.185
That's encouraging to...

21:10.311 --> 21:11.686
To a man like me.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.524
CFD's in good hands.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.495
- Why don't we clear the air, Shay?
- There's nothing to talk about.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.413
Well, there is
if you're still pissed at me.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.332
Well, I'm over it, so...

21:37.755 --> 21:39.214
Did you see that?

21:49.183 --> 21:51.059
What? She shouldn't have cut me off.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.967
- Hey.
- What's up?

22:27.013 --> 22:31.057
Um, there aren't many things I hate more
than unsolicited advice.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.101
- Oh, no.
- Give me one minute.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.938
- You can set your watch by it.
- Okay, literally, a minute.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.233
I had a very good friend named Gil.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.820
We were in the same unit in Iraq.
Second tour for both of us.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.114
Gil was a real character,
big motor mouth.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.741
Very good soldier.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.746
And, uh, he was always talking
about how everyone has this hourglass,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.832
and, uh, the top of it is obscured,

22:55.958 --> 22:57.917
so you don't know
how much sand you have left.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.294
And he'd be like, uh,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.838
"Hey, Clarke, how much sand
do you think we got left?"

23:01.964 --> 23:03.089
How much sand?

23:03.215 --> 23:06.760
Anyway, we get back
and he started to slip.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.137
His mom was worried about him,
like the rest of us,

23:09.263 --> 23:11.222
and she asked me to keep an eye on him.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.725
And I did. I tried.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.770
Uh...

23:16.896 --> 23:21.066
I was outside Wrigley,
and Gil was supposed to meet me there,

23:21.192 --> 23:25.779
and I get a text from him,
"There's no more sand."

23:27.073 --> 23:28.823
I go racing over there.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.535
He didn't make it.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.665
I know what you saw
when that guy shot himself.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.461
And I think I know
what you're going through.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.965
You can twist yourself up in knots
trying to understand it

23:46.092 --> 23:47.342
or second-guess your actions.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.261
But ultimately, I don't think
it's for us to figure out.

23:54.725 --> 23:55.934
Or carry.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.287
Did you do this?

24:16.413 --> 24:17.664
- You got something to say?
- No.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.291
Nothing I haven't
already said to your face.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.426
Transfer forms?

24:31.387 --> 24:33.805
Anybody man enough
to say it to my face?

24:36.225 --> 24:39.394
I signed it personally
so there's no confusion.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.147
I'd like you to leave 51.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.526
Aren't you in the middle
of an election, Randall?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.403
You really think this is a good idea?

24:49.697 --> 24:51.447
Beat it.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.539
Lieutenants.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.834
This how you lead your men?

25:12.887 --> 25:14.345
Are you aware of this?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.600
- I am.
- OK.

25:20.269 --> 25:25.231
Well, I'm willing to forget it happened
only if you go back in...

25:28.360 --> 25:29.944
Say hi to McLeod for me.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.389
How do you say,
"You're amazing" in Russian?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.648
You're pretty damn
, Zoya.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.070
Only for special person.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.446
Me too.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.119
I'm little bit sad.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.331
About?

26:23.457 --> 26:24.707
Visa.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.418
I have to go back to Russia soon.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.087
Oh, that sucks.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.423
You can come back
and visit though, right?

26:34.343 --> 26:37.053
Maybe. I hope.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.481
I wish I could live here.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.403
I hear you.

27:02.705 --> 27:06.582
A house party
in the house!

27:07.418 --> 27:10.336
Oh, no. That's tonight?

27:12.756 --> 27:16.175
Oh!
Nice move, Mouch!

27:16.302 --> 27:17.885
That's some next
level-type skills, yo.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.846
Is it just gonna be us?

27:19.972 --> 27:22.432
Yeah, is that a problem?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.559
No, I'm just asking.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.270
Your turn, Shay.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.026
Oh, Shay with the power move!

27:33.152 --> 27:35.653
Oh, yeah!

27:35.779 --> 27:37.530
Oh, hey, guys. Perfect timing.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.449
Come down, grab a beer. Join us.

27:40.743 --> 27:42.869
- Hey, Jo-Jo!
- Hey.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.330
Uh, you know what?
I'm going to get out of here.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.123
My brother wants to catch a movie.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.251
- See you guys.
- I'm gonna go to bed.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.545
Drive you home?
Thank you.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.142
Living here sucks, dude.
I got to get out.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.270
Mmm. How was your shift?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.230
We saved somebody's life.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.775
That's so hot.

28:13.901 --> 28:17.070
Well, we save lives
like every day, so...

28:18.572 --> 28:22.116
God, I deal with lobbyists
and policy wonks all day.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.453
- What's a policy wonk?
- Be glad you don't know.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.624
God, being around you,
being around the house,

28:29.750 --> 28:32.335
people actually doing something
meaningful with their lives...

28:32.461 --> 28:34.420
Oh, come on, you do too.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.006
God, you're adorable.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.300
Seriously, Gabby.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.223
I'm sorry.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.642
- I don't know why I said that. I...
- Don't sweat it.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.521
I'll open some wine.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.649
Yeah, sure.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.488
Hey, then move out.
It's a free country.

29:00.614 --> 29:05.451
I can't. Not with Shay going
through whatever she's going through.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.121
- Dawson knows. Right, Dawson?
- Yep.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.998
Old Mother Hubbard here.
Game Day killed us.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.335
Evening.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.549
All right, we're short 250.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.509
Been slow the last few weeks, so...

29:21.635 --> 29:25.179
That bar down the street's
been really taking a chunk out of us.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.389
Hmm.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.351
You know, if you would've just made
me an equal partner in this place,

29:30.477 --> 29:35.022
like I so kindly offered, there wouldn't
be a Game Day down the street.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.067
You want to knock me down
to a flat fee, fine.

29:38.193 --> 29:42.405
But you damn well
better come up with that flat fee.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.949
You'll have it. Friday.

30:05.929 --> 30:10.224
You come up short again

30:10.350 --> 30:12.643
and you'll be serving
beer out of a tent.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.576
So this is Antonio's plan?

30:28.702 --> 30:31.370
- Let this guy destroy our bar?
- Herrmann, I said I'd talk to him.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.707
OK. You know what?
You tell Antonio that I got a plan now.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.126
I'm going to keep a sawed-off.410
behind the bar

30:37.252 --> 30:39.253
and the next time Arthur and Jay
come into here,

30:39.379 --> 30:40.505
it's sayonara, baby!

30:40.631 --> 30:43.549
Is that him? Is that Antonio?

30:43.675 --> 30:44.842
I'll be right back.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.971
Article Seven of
the Illinois Criminal Code,

30:49.097 --> 30:52.433
"Unlawful entry into,
or attack on one's dwelling,

30:52.559 --> 30:54.060
you can use force."

30:54.186 --> 30:56.729
Yeah. Or we could just sell the place.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.860
What the hell is going on?

31:02.986 --> 31:04.946
Look, I've told my superiors,
everyone is aware.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.864
We just don't have enough
to take him down yet.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.163
Look, you've got to know
that it killed me

31:14.289 --> 31:16.082
not to defend you back there.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.334
It's the hardest
thing about this,

31:19.378 --> 31:20.962
is having to play a role.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.300
Are you playing a role right now?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.515
Of course not.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.790
Yeah, they've stopped by a couple times,

31:57.916 --> 32:01.168
but, uh, Griffin, he's still not
comfortable

32:01.295 --> 32:02.295
coming in the firehouse.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.422
I know. I warned you about that.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.676
- How's Ben?
- He's great.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.512
- He's more focused in school.
- Good.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.223
Yeah, they're both doing better.

32:16.351 --> 32:20.938
Heather, they talk about you
all the time, all right?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.231
They miss you.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.484
Hey.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.368
I mean, this is torture.

32:37.789 --> 32:43.794
Listen, I was talking to someone
yesterday about getting help,

32:43.920 --> 32:45.630
getting you into minimum security.

32:45.756 --> 32:48.591
- Oh.
- So you can spend time with the boys.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.843
Yeah.

32:52.346 --> 32:55.264
Heather, you've got to stay strong.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.353
All right?

33:03.732 --> 33:05.733
- Hey!
- Hey, Zoya.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.361
- How's everything?
- Good!

33:08.487 --> 33:12.740
- Um, I just want to talk to you.
- OK. About?

33:12.866 --> 33:16.035
Well, I was thinking,
if I go back to Saint Petersburg,

33:16.161 --> 33:18.287
it is sad for you, and for me.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.705
OK.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.957
Maybe there's way I don't have to go.

33:22.084 --> 33:26.545
I think this sound crazy,
and I ask you as friend,

33:26.672 --> 33:30.049
but if I were to be married,
I could stay.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.926
Oh!

33:32.052 --> 33:34.095
If you would want that, too.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.680
Yeah, I'm... I...

33:36.598 --> 33:39.517
Listen, I'd love to,
and I'd do it in a second,

33:39.643 --> 33:41.435
but I can't. I...

33:41.561 --> 33:45.606
For a lot of reasons that, you know,
I...

33:45.732 --> 33:48.067
- Trust me...
- I understand.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.610
I sorry to ask.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.656
I think I don't come by anymore.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.200
Before my heart goes more for you.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.539
Zoya.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.082
I'm... I'm sorry.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.167
I really am.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.191
- Hey.
- Oh!

34:30.986 --> 34:33.696
Thank you so much for meeting me
on such short notice.

34:33.822 --> 34:34.864
Not a problem.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.452
- How's your son doing?
- Good.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.036
I told him what I know.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.663
There might be a change.

34:43.957 --> 34:46.834
You know, I've been
doing this for a while

34:46.960 --> 34:52.590
and I always envision the endgame
and what it's going to be.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.468
But how I get there?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.428
I gave up trying to anticipate that,

34:57.554 --> 35:00.514
because things never quite go down
the way you think.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.436
I like your style, Benny.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.775
You care, but first and foremost
you're a pragmatist.

35:10.901 --> 35:11.984
OK.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.573
I'm trying to save Firehouse 51.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.869
I believe you.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.665
If I were to save it... If...

35:28.001 --> 35:29.835
I need somebody in place
that I can trust.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.924
I want you to replace Boden.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.513
Wow.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.437
So, these are your exam results.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.189
Now, nobody shoot the messenger.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.317
Cholesterol on par,
pulse rate great,

35:53.443 --> 35:55.486
muscle mass only
slightly below normal.

35:55.612 --> 35:59.573
Even my body fat is spitting distance
to the classification of fit.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.410
All that seaweed and rice paper
does a body good.

36:03.537 --> 36:07.289
Greg Sullivan can kiss
my able-bodied ass.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.624
Hold up, this can't be right.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.253
Herrmann has one percent
less body fat than me.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.587
Why are you so mystified?

36:13.713 --> 36:15.673
'Cause I got a couple of years on you?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.800
Couple?

36:17.926 --> 36:19.927
- You know what?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:21.263 --> 36:23.389
- Suck on this.
- No!

36:34.401 --> 36:35.651
Come on in.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.073
Chief, um...

36:41.199 --> 36:42.992
I know that you're dealing with
a lot right now,

36:43.118 --> 36:45.119
but I need to talk to you
about something in your test.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.412
OK.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.456
There's a protein in our blood
called osteopontin.

36:49.583 --> 36:53.085
Um, your levels are
higher than expected.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.253
Meaning what?

36:55.380 --> 36:58.215
Sometimes it's an indicator
for asbestos poisoning.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.886
But it could be nothing.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.930
Still, I strongly recommend that you go
and get an MRI done on your lungs.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.892
I haven't been around asbestos
in 15 years.

37:08.018 --> 37:09.226
Well, it can remain latent.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.605
Twenty years, ten years, five.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.189
Or not all.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.859
Look, the key is an early diagnosis.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.406
- I can look to some specialists. I...
- No.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.992
Leave the report on the desk, please.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.549
The thing about interest rates,

37:40.675 --> 37:43.344
if they rise during your lock-in period,
it won't affect you.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.388
You'll still pay the lower rate
you took in the first place.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.434
Hide the silverware.
Devon's here.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.562
- Devon-11, open 24/7.
- Mm-hmm.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.815
Oh. She is so shady.

38:05.575 --> 38:08.327
Um, I'm, uh... I'm gonna...

38:08.828 --> 38:10.871
I'll be right back. OK.

38:18.838 --> 38:22.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.678
How'd you get mixed up
with these gossipy bitches?

38:39.693 --> 38:41.151
I'm building up my position.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.861
Yes, I can see that.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.822
What is that, 15 troops?

38:44.948 --> 38:49.284
- Is Gabby coming by?
- Uh, not tonight. No.

38:49.411 --> 38:53.122
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She is not.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.540
Why isn't she?

38:55.917 --> 38:58.293
Will you roll the dice already?

38:58.420 --> 39:01.672
No! Dead.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.799
If you want to go out tonight,
I can babysit Ben.

39:03.925 --> 39:07.011
I don't want to go out.
I want to hang with you guys.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.389
I want to defeat you,
over here, in Chicago Land.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.477
Can I come back to the firehouse?

39:17.397 --> 39:19.565
Yeah.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.066
Any time you want.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.363
- For Chicago.
- Chicago.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.325
Full security cameras with database,

39:30.452 --> 39:32.786
plus 24-hour armed response.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.538
And how much is this going to cost?

39:35.749 --> 39:38.459
Nothing up front.
No payments for three months.

39:38.585 --> 39:42.296
Can we just talk about reality here
for a minute?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.339
Game Day isn't going anywhere.

39:44.466 --> 39:50.054
It's getting more and more popular
and we're serving tumbleweeds, man.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.349
Let's just walk away.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.020
There's no shame in that.

39:59.147 --> 40:02.232
Sure there is. Losing is for losers.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.153
It is all for best.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.488
He's an idiot.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.032
That's not very nice, but thank you.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.785
All I know is, if it were me,

40:12.911 --> 40:15.245
I'd be proud to be your boyfriend.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.999
You're a good man, Jo-Jo.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.034
Can I help you with something?

40:56.412 --> 40:57.955
I love 51.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.669
I'll do whatever it takes to save it.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.807
My resignation.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.659
Look how far you've come, huh?

41:37.162 --> 41:38.912
You're a lieutenant.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.587
I have some news.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.801
I'm taking over 51.
