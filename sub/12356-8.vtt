WEBVTT

00:00.354 --> 00:02.154
Today is payday, motherfucker.

00:02.189 --> 00:04.665
$2.5 million in fees and...

00:04.779 --> 00:06.078
K and A is picking up

00:06.114 --> 00:08.948
an extra9.2 million
equity piece.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.583
MARTY:
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:10.618 --> 00:11.584
<i>Since we killed it</i>

00:11.619 --> 00:13.872
at Gage Motors,
we are out of the woods.

00:13.992 --> 00:16.254
Can you please just tell me
when the money is coming, Ellis?

00:16.290 --> 00:17.757
ELLIS: Gage put K and
A back on the map.

00:17.792 --> 00:19.125
That should be
more than enough payment.

00:19.127 --> 00:20.292
It would take a Titan

00:20.294 --> 00:22.054
to be able to afford
to challenge us legally.

00:23.014 --> 00:24.764
I have to go pick up
my asshole father.

00:24.799 --> 00:27.717
I'm gonna drop dead in some
Gomorrah flophouse. Terrific.

00:27.769 --> 00:28.850
What are you talking about?

00:28.853 --> 00:30.302
Stage four pancreatic,

00:30.354 --> 00:32.054
wise ass.

00:32.106 --> 00:34.473
CLYDE: She's smart, funny,
knows exactly what she wants.

00:34.475 --> 00:35.808
I feel like there's
something special here

00:35.810 --> 00:37.727
and we should really see where it goes.
No.

00:37.779 --> 00:40.396
My fault for being the gullible one, right?
You trust people.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.281
It's one of the things
I like most about you.

00:42.316 --> 00:43.315
Oh, God.

00:44.702 --> 00:46.118
MARTY:
<i>When are you gonna</i>

00:46.154 --> 00:47.653
rape and pillage my company?

00:47.705 --> 00:49.655
I think I'm gonna stick
to raping and pillaging you.

00:49.657 --> 00:50.990
Marty.

00:51.042 --> 00:51.991
We were just talking about you.

00:52.043 --> 00:53.125
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

00:53.161 --> 00:55.628
You need to step up and
pay us the money, bitch.

00:55.663 --> 00:58.748
Oh, we gonna make
these motherfuckers bleed!

This motherfucker.

01:05.890 --> 01:07.173
Seven.

01:07.175 --> 01:08.974
What?
Seven "motherfuckers"

01:09.010 --> 01:10.259
since I got here.

01:10.311 --> 01:11.927
Please, switch it up.

01:11.979 --> 01:13.979
(siren wailing in distance)

01:15.233 --> 01:17.433
Motherfucker.

01:17.485 --> 01:19.435
Eight.

01:19.487 --> 01:22.521
I swear to God, Ellis Hightower
is the biggest, meanest

01:22.523 --> 01:24.406
shark-eating-est whale
I have ever--

01:24.442 --> 01:25.441
are you hearing me?--

01:25.493 --> 01:26.859
that I have ever landed.

01:26.861 --> 01:28.577
And what do I have
to show for it?

01:28.613 --> 01:30.196
A fuckton of debt

01:30.248 --> 01:32.782
and a metaphorically
aching asshole.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.250
I swear, it's like...

01:34.285 --> 01:36.118
it's like escaping the <i> Titanic</i>

01:36.170 --> 01:38.370
and then burning to death
in the fucking life raft

01:38.372 --> 01:40.372
as it goes up in smoke.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.175
Hmm-mm!
Denna, come on.

01:43.211 --> 01:44.293
(giggles)
Will you stop, please?

01:44.345 --> 01:46.712
I need that more than you.
Mmm.

01:46.714 --> 01:50.633
♪ Plays the victim
every time... ♪

01:50.685 --> 01:52.134
Oh, thank you.

01:54.639 --> 01:56.939
I ju... I mean, it's just
this motherfucking asshole.

01:56.974 --> 01:58.524
I bring K and A
back from the brink, then...

01:58.559 --> 01:59.725
I can see where this is headed,

01:59.727 --> 02:00.893
so let me stop you.

02:00.945 --> 02:02.528
The answer is still no.

02:02.563 --> 02:03.696
I am not playing

02:03.731 --> 02:04.864
Santa Claus to K and A.

02:04.899 --> 02:06.148
Who asked you
to fucking play Santa Claus?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.900
I'm high, not stupid.

02:07.902 --> 02:09.451
Yeah, well, that look?

02:09.487 --> 02:10.485
Kind of the same.

02:12.907 --> 02:14.206
Come here.

02:14.242 --> 02:16.242
Let's try again.

02:17.662 --> 02:19.962
Ooh. Mm.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.833
Ooh...

02:23.885 --> 02:25.417
You still worried about Ellis?

02:25.469 --> 02:27.253
(laughs)
Not for the next 15 minutes.

02:27.305 --> 02:29.004
Fifteen?

02:29.056 --> 02:30.005
You're optimistic.

02:30.057 --> 02:32.057
You know you love a challenge.

02:32.093 --> 02:34.426
(laughs)

02:35.513 --> 02:37.513
(hisses)
Teeth, teeth. Teeth.

02:43.154 --> 02:44.603
(cat meows)

02:44.655 --> 02:46.572
(groans)
CLYDE: Morning, Dad.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.190
So, my son.

02:48.242 --> 02:49.408
What's up for us today?

02:49.443 --> 02:50.776
Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

02:50.828 --> 02:51.911
but I'm going to work.

02:51.946 --> 02:53.195
Right. Of course.

02:53.247 --> 02:55.030
Because they can't get by
without you at all.

02:55.082 --> 02:56.248
That's why you're a partner.

02:56.284 --> 02:57.199
(cat meows)

02:57.251 --> 02:58.868
Jesus, Dad, really?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.035
All right. Calm down, would you?

03:00.087 --> 03:01.537
But I still say

03:01.589 --> 03:03.038
you ought to be able
to have one day off

03:03.090 --> 03:04.707
to hang out with your dad,
who's on his last legs.

03:04.759 --> 03:08.010
Oh... death card,
played before 8:00 a.m.

03:08.045 --> 03:10.045
Hat tip, Dad. Fantastic.
You know what?

03:10.097 --> 03:12.514
"Comedy is the refuge
of the simpleminded.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.266
And blacks."
Descartes.

03:14.302 --> 03:16.886
I'm pretty sure Descartes
didn't say "and blacks."

03:16.938 --> 03:19.305
When was the last time
that you and me just hung out?

03:19.357 --> 03:20.356
This is easy.

03:20.391 --> 03:21.640
February, 1994.

03:21.692 --> 03:22.808
I wanted to see Nirvana;

03:22.810 --> 03:24.109
you took me to a greyhound race.

03:24.145 --> 03:27.396
Look, let me just take you out
for one night, okay?

03:27.448 --> 03:28.769
Dad...
It'll be a boys' night out.

03:28.783 --> 03:29.815
It'll be fun.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.150
You can do that for me.

03:31.152 --> 03:32.234
Um...

03:32.286 --> 03:33.569
Cancer.

03:33.621 --> 03:35.905
Fine. Fine.

03:35.957 --> 03:37.573
Okay?
You can take me out

03:37.625 --> 03:38.791
on a boys' night.

03:38.826 --> 03:40.659
But if you fuck me on this,

03:40.661 --> 03:41.994
I'm taking that feral
piece of shit and throwing it

03:42.046 --> 03:42.995
in a high-kill shelter.

03:43.047 --> 03:44.964
(meows)

03:44.999 --> 03:47.166
He didn't meant that,
Natalie Portman.

03:47.218 --> 03:49.501
You seriously named that cat

03:49.553 --> 03:50.586
Natalie...

03:50.638 --> 03:52.137
O...kay.
No, I see it.

03:52.173 --> 03:54.173
Her face is kind of...

03:54.175 --> 03:55.591
tiny, cute and Jewish.

03:55.643 --> 03:57.092
All right, true or false:

03:57.144 --> 03:58.560
Everyone in this room

03:58.596 --> 04:00.346
thinks they're smarter than
everybody else in the building.

04:00.398 --> 04:01.430
True.
True.

04:01.482 --> 04:02.514
Okay. True or false:

04:02.516 --> 04:03.983
Everyone in the building

04:04.018 --> 04:05.601
thinks they're smarter than
everybody else in the world.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.319
Mm, that's obvious.
That's probably true, yeah.

04:07.355 --> 04:08.771
Yeah, that's true.
MARTY: Okay.

04:08.823 --> 04:10.022
So let's prove us all right

04:10.024 --> 04:11.690
and find a way to find Marty Mar

04:11.692 --> 04:14.109
$10 million before lunch.

04:14.161 --> 04:15.527
Um, yeah. Mm.

04:15.529 --> 04:16.528
Okay, Doug, spit it out.

04:16.529 --> 04:17.829
What do you have?
Say it.

04:17.865 --> 04:19.365
DOUG: Well, okay.
Look, it's just an option,

04:19.367 --> 04:20.366
but hear me out.

04:20.368 --> 04:22.785
Uh, our old exterminator
client, Rat Man?

04:22.837 --> 04:24.453
Well, he's got
a-a QVC line

04:24.505 --> 04:27.006
of organic poisons out
now, and it's a big hit

04:27.041 --> 04:29.508
with the stay-at-home mom set,
so we have an in.

04:29.543 --> 04:31.377
Are you kidding me?
Oh, come on.

04:31.379 --> 04:33.545
I cannot be the only one
who's seen those commercials.

04:33.547 --> 04:35.388
With the little rats and their...
To be honest,

04:35.433 --> 04:39.551
I don't know which one
is sadder, Doug watching QVC

04:39.603 --> 04:41.387
in that gutted shack
he calls a home

04:41.439 --> 04:44.189
or him thinking that this is
actually a viable option. Kids?

04:44.225 --> 04:45.858
QVC. For sure.
MARTY AND CLYDE: QVC.

04:45.893 --> 04:47.559
You can find a bargain on QVC.

04:47.561 --> 04:51.030
- If only one of us were fucking
a billionaire investor. - Oh, my God,

04:51.065 --> 04:52.564
why didn't I think of that?
Wait a minute,

04:52.566 --> 04:53.983
already fucking thought of it.

04:54.035 --> 04:55.567
It's a non-starter.
DOUG: And yet those...

04:55.569 --> 04:58.070
those larcenists at Gage
are printing money

04:58.072 --> 05:00.406
because we sent their
stocks through the roof.

05:00.408 --> 05:01.323
I mean, the poetry. We did that.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.742
Boom.

05:03.794 --> 05:04.910
Hmm?

05:04.962 --> 05:06.745
CLYDE:
Boom what?

05:06.797 --> 05:08.497
You know I hate a hanging boom,
Marty. What do we got?

05:08.549 --> 05:12.918
We-we did. We did send that
stock through the fucking roof.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.752
Okay.
So we can

05:13.804 --> 05:15.220
send it right back down

05:15.256 --> 05:16.922
to the gutter.

05:16.974 --> 05:18.557
Ellis already gave us
the silver bullet.

05:18.592 --> 05:20.476
Yes, that's what
I was saying. Yes.

05:20.511 --> 05:23.429
My office. 20 minutes.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:23.481 --> 05:26.265
(sighs) Oh, God. He gets it.
Oh, Marty...(sighs)

05:26.267 --> 05:29.018
I want a donut.
Yeah,

05:29.070 --> 05:31.020
a fucking donut, Clyde. Okay?

05:31.072 --> 05:33.032
And I might even eat
the whole box. And if you say

05:33.074 --> 05:35.274
one more goddamn word
about my weight,

05:35.326 --> 05:38.777
I swear I will highlight,
at full volume, every flaw

05:38.829 --> 05:40.779
on your
under-earning body

05:40.781 --> 05:42.531
until you weep like
the pussified waste of flesh

05:42.583 --> 05:43.749
that you are.

05:43.784 --> 05:45.951
Fuck...

05:45.953 --> 05:48.370
Just asking
if you can bring me one.

05:48.422 --> 05:50.372
Jesus Christ, Jeannie.

05:50.424 --> 05:52.791
Sorry. I grew up poor, so I...

05:52.793 --> 05:54.877
Could you maybe bring me one?
I don't know.

05:54.929 --> 05:55.961
Okay.

05:55.963 --> 05:57.346
Call me as soon
as it comes in, okay?

05:57.381 --> 05:58.797
I mean as soon as.
Marty.

05:58.799 --> 06:00.382
Okay, yes, Doug, I've
seen the commercials,

06:00.434 --> 06:02.801
and I kind of like it when the
animated rat starts twerking.

06:02.853 --> 06:04.686
I knew it.
(chuckles) I knew it.

06:04.722 --> 06:06.889
What do you want?
Hey, so, um, you know Kelsey.

06:06.941 --> 06:09.892
Nope.
Kelsey, the girl from YWTPA.

06:09.944 --> 06:13.112
I can't keep track
of all the white gangs, Doug.

06:13.147 --> 06:15.364
All right. Okay.
So you know her.

06:15.399 --> 06:18.650
(sighs)
The thing is, uh,

06:18.652 --> 06:20.819
well, I kind of slept with her

06:20.821 --> 06:22.571
last night.
So?

06:22.623 --> 06:25.157
Well, so...
Clyde has feelings for her.

06:25.159 --> 06:26.492
I know.
It's insane.

06:26.494 --> 06:27.743
Like, actual feelings.

06:27.795 --> 06:29.078
And not just the ones
in his loins.

06:29.130 --> 06:30.329
I mean...
We-we talked

06:30.381 --> 06:31.663
about you using that word
around me, Doug.

06:31.715 --> 06:33.298
God, it just feels good
in my mouth.

06:33.334 --> 06:35.250
I don't know
why I do it. Yeah,

06:35.302 --> 06:37.419
I don't know what to do. The-the
guilt is just eating away at me.

06:37.471 --> 06:38.637
Okay, so stop fucking her.

06:38.672 --> 06:40.556
Yeah, I don't know
if I can do that, Marty.

06:40.591 --> 06:42.508
I mean, she's kind of
got this move.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.643
Oof, it's insane.

06:44.678 --> 06:46.762
It's like
this-this combination finger,

06:46.814 --> 06:48.597
like, tongue-back arch thing.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.983
Oh, my God.

06:51.018 --> 06:53.185
It's amazing. Yeah.

06:53.187 --> 06:57.322
But, um...

06:57.358 --> 06:59.324
Yeah. I see what you're saying.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.610
Okay. Thanks, buddy.
It's a good talk.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.169
Yes, give me Denna Altshuler.

07:10.204 --> 07:12.287
Look, my Uncle Grant is some
kind of big shot advertising guy

07:12.339 --> 07:14.423
at Neon. He's on board
to hook up a bunch of free press

07:14.458 --> 07:15.624
when the app launches.
Great.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.876
Free? No. Bullshit.
He's gonna want equity.

07:17.878 --> 07:19.545
Yeah.
Well, full disclosure, he's only doing it

07:19.547 --> 07:21.463
so I won't out him
for molesting my brothers.

07:21.515 --> 07:22.798
CLYDE:
Wow. Okay.

07:22.850 --> 07:23.799
Just so I can get this straight,

07:23.851 --> 07:25.968
you will extort a pedophile,

07:26.020 --> 07:27.636
but you won't get dinner with me

07:27.688 --> 07:29.388
because that goes
against your moral code.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.557
Yeah.
That's-that's your judging system.

07:31.559 --> 07:32.975
Okay.

07:33.027 --> 07:34.977
Jesus Christ.

07:35.029 --> 07:36.979
(chuckles)

07:38.782 --> 07:40.732
Dude, I made up that last part.

07:40.784 --> 07:43.702
Did you seriously think that...
I... Well... No, I know that.

07:43.737 --> 07:46.038
- Really? - No, I feel sorry for Clyde.
I don't think he got it.

07:46.073 --> 07:48.373
Dude, no, you're-you're dark.
Not... Come on.

07:48.409 --> 07:50.292
I get... I get...
I get sex offender jokes.

07:50.327 --> 07:52.578
It's, like, my sweet spot.
(chuckling): Oh, right.

07:52.630 --> 07:55.747
So, uh, good times
last night, huh?

07:55.749 --> 07:58.000
Yeah. For sure.
Yeah.

07:58.052 --> 08:00.669
You, uh, want
to hang out again later?

08:00.721 --> 08:03.255
(quietly): Oh, my God, yes.
Absolutely. Definitely.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.591
But...

08:05.593 --> 08:09.728
I, um... I-I kind of feel guilty
about last night.

08:09.763 --> 08:12.097
Is this because you have HPV?

08:12.149 --> 08:14.766
What?
Seriously, why does everybody have fucking HPV?

08:14.818 --> 08:16.435
No, no, no. God. Jesus. No.

08:16.487 --> 08:18.270
It's... Look, I mean Clyde.

08:18.322 --> 08:20.772
Clyde really likes you, Kelsey.

08:20.774 --> 08:23.275
And Clyde doesn't
really like anyone, so...

08:23.277 --> 08:25.611
So that means, what, I'm obliged

08:25.613 --> 08:27.696
to accept his offer of penis?
No, no, no,

08:27.748 --> 08:29.581
no, no, no. I-I...
I'm just saying

08:29.617 --> 08:32.083
that I know Clyde comes off
like a bit of a douche.

08:32.119 --> 08:34.239
And he is. Believe me,
no one knows that more than me.

08:34.255 --> 08:37.256
But he's also my best friend.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.759
So... (groans)
it's kind of a bit tricky,

08:40.794 --> 08:43.629
huh? Boy.

08:43.631 --> 08:46.598
Oh, the games we play.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.767
(chuckles)
Yeah,

08:48.802 --> 08:50.135
am I being too hard on myself?

08:50.187 --> 08:52.304
That's also a possibility.

08:52.306 --> 08:53.305
No, you're right.

08:53.357 --> 08:54.439
Am I?
I get it.

08:54.475 --> 08:56.892
And, honestly,
I have mad respect

08:56.944 --> 08:58.810
for a guy who'd give up
top-shelf genius vag

08:58.862 --> 08:59.811
for a friendship.

08:59.863 --> 09:01.480
Ooh, I wouldn't say "give up."

09:01.482 --> 09:04.816
No, "give up" is-is very
strong, isn't it? And final.

09:04.818 --> 09:06.285
No, no. I'm-I'm not looking
to fuck things up between you

09:06.320 --> 09:08.070
and Clyde.
Good.

09:08.122 --> 09:09.454
We can totally chill on the sex.

09:09.490 --> 09:11.290
Awesome.

09:11.325 --> 09:12.741
Clyde is

09:12.793 --> 09:14.576
a good guy, so...
Good luck

09:14.628 --> 09:16.745
finding another Rhodes scholar
who gives rimjobs though.

09:16.797 --> 09:18.664
(scoffs)
HARVEY: <i>I tell Clyde</i>

09:18.666 --> 09:20.382
you can't just sit on your ass
and wait for opportunity

09:20.417 --> 09:21.967
to fall in your lap.

09:22.002 --> 09:24.002
But this generation?
(chuckles)

09:24.054 --> 09:25.470
The world is yours
for the taking.

09:25.506 --> 09:27.172
You don't like your job,

09:27.174 --> 09:29.341
you start your own corporation.
Oh, right. Yeah.

09:29.393 --> 09:32.511
- Hey. - In your six-year-old son's name
so his credit is ruined

09:32.563 --> 09:33.645
by second grade. Right?

09:33.681 --> 09:34.813
Yeah.

09:34.848 --> 09:36.181
Mm, this was nice.

09:36.183 --> 09:37.899
Can I talk to you for one second?
Nice to meet you.

09:37.935 --> 09:40.068
Hey, Dad.

09:40.104 --> 09:41.937
What the fuck
are you doing here?

09:41.989 --> 09:43.855
I just thought I would see
you in action. That's all.

09:43.907 --> 09:45.524
So you could tell me everything
that I'm doing wrong?

09:45.576 --> 09:47.326
Is that what it is? Okay.
Your words.

09:47.361 --> 09:49.027
Dad, you got to get out of here.
I'm gonna see you tonight.

09:49.029 --> 09:50.362
So I'll see you tonight.

09:50.414 --> 09:51.997
What? What?

09:52.032 --> 09:53.782
The hysterics.
Shades of your mother.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.951
Even less attractive on you.

09:56.003 --> 09:58.483
Okay. It's time to go. Thank you
for that. But it's time to go.

09:58.505 --> 09:59.538
I just got here.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.290
What else do you need to see?

10:04.845 --> 10:06.295
You're smiling.

10:06.347 --> 10:08.213
I'm smiling.

10:08.265 --> 10:09.548
Okay.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.383
Stop smiling.
It's freaking me out.

10:11.385 --> 10:15.304
I can't. Oh, I've been chasing
Denna Altshuler's

10:15.356 --> 10:17.139
huge, perky hedge fund

10:17.191 --> 10:19.141
for over a decade,
and I finally have something

10:19.193 --> 10:21.276
worth her time.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.779
Assuming that's not
a penis reference,

10:23.814 --> 10:26.732
care to elaborate
so maybe I can do my job?

10:26.734 --> 10:29.401
(clears throat)
Denna is a beast.

10:29.403 --> 10:31.453
And beasts need to feed.

10:31.488 --> 10:33.572
The bigger the beast,
the bigger the appetite.

10:33.624 --> 10:36.375
Assuming that that's not
a penis reference...

10:36.410 --> 10:39.077
I have a vague recollection

10:39.129 --> 10:41.747
of Ellis Hightower pissing

10:41.749 --> 10:44.049
all over his brand-new
baby prototype.

10:44.084 --> 10:46.718
Found the security footage.

10:46.754 --> 10:49.254
And if you zoom in very closely,

10:49.256 --> 10:50.922
you can make out a bit
of back-spray hitting

10:50.974 --> 10:52.924
an Indian fellow.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.393
I believe the man's an engineer.

10:54.428 --> 10:57.679
There's a bonus hate crime?

10:57.731 --> 10:59.681
It's so despicably hate-y.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.683
And Denna freebases hate.

11:01.735 --> 11:04.236
Look, K and A,
not big enough to satisfy her.

11:04.271 --> 11:06.438
But say, I don't know,
an extra $80 million

11:06.440 --> 11:08.940
from shorting the Gage Motors stock?
Ooh.

11:08.992 --> 11:09.941
We give her this ammo,

11:09.993 --> 11:12.027
and greedy, greedy Denna

11:12.079 --> 11:15.447
will gladly merengue all over Ellis's grave.
And there's

11:15.449 --> 11:17.165
no traceable link back to us.

11:17.201 --> 11:19.868
She goes public
and assumes all the risk.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.453
(chuckles)

11:21.505 --> 11:24.956
Prison makes smarter criminals.

11:26.794 --> 11:27.959
(chuckles)

11:27.961 --> 11:29.544
I'm gonna see you at the
restaurant tonight, okay?

11:29.596 --> 11:30.796
MARTY (singsongy):
Clyde.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.798
No. No.
You're not gonna introduce us?

11:32.850 --> 11:34.299
You must be Marty,

11:34.351 --> 11:36.802
right? Harvey. Harvey Oberholt.

11:36.804 --> 11:40.055
What is that? We are family.
You bring it in here, big guy.

11:40.107 --> 11:41.273
(both chuckle)

11:41.308 --> 11:42.941
Me, too. Me, too.
Get in here.

11:42.976 --> 11:44.976
Both of you guys?
The more the merrier.

11:45.028 --> 11:47.396
Oh, I'm Jeannie.
What a pleasure.

11:47.448 --> 11:50.065
This is a nice operation
you've got here.

11:50.117 --> 11:52.484
Of course, it could be better
if you were to use

11:52.486 --> 11:54.403
Clyde here to his full potential.
Oh.

11:54.455 --> 11:57.155
760 verbal. No tutoring.
We don't have to talk

11:57.157 --> 11:58.990
- about that anymore, Dad. - This is partner
material you got over here, Marty.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.493
You know what I'm saying?
Smart, smart boy.

12:01.545 --> 12:02.794
Don't let him slip

12:02.830 --> 12:04.296
between your fingers.
That is great advice.

12:04.331 --> 12:05.881
Dear God, if you make this stop,

12:05.916 --> 12:07.632
I will start believing in you.
Business cards. Awesome! Look, Jeannie.

12:07.668 --> 12:08.633
Amen.
JEANNIE: Okay.

12:08.669 --> 12:09.634
Listen, we'll get together,

12:09.670 --> 12:10.635
we'll talk shop.

12:10.671 --> 12:11.951
You've had
some tough times here,

12:11.972 --> 12:13.138
I know, but, uh,

12:13.173 --> 12:14.890
you're gonna bounce back.

12:14.925 --> 12:17.092
Trust me. I know the game
all too well.

12:17.144 --> 12:20.178
(elevator bell dings)
Oh! Elevator. So you got to get going.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.481
- Oh. Can we ride down with you?
- No. - Yeah, come on.

12:22.516 --> 12:24.182
You don't have to. Marty. Oh...
No, we'd love to.

12:24.234 --> 12:25.851
JEANNIE: So you
were in consulting?

12:25.903 --> 12:28.937
Well, sweetheart, let's just say
that, uh, I've done it all.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.389
Well, then we've got
to hear it all.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.359
♪ ♪

12:36.697 --> 12:38.413
♪ This is who I am ♪

12:38.449 --> 12:41.533
Ellis Hightower is an abscess.

12:41.585 --> 12:43.001
A blood-sucking fraud.

12:43.036 --> 12:45.537
He fired every engineer.
The new model is a six-figure

12:45.539 --> 12:47.172
death trap.
Total crisis

12:47.207 --> 12:48.340
of confidence.
Leadership vacuum.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.792
With an amuse-bouche
of underage hooker

12:50.844 --> 12:53.011
and peeing on employee,
and, yeah, baby...

12:53.046 --> 12:54.546
It's on video.
All on video.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.848
Gage Motors stock is gonna
fall very, very far.

12:56.884 --> 12:58.350
Very, very fast.

12:58.385 --> 13:00.352
But only if someone
has the chesticles

13:00.387 --> 13:02.521
to stand up and tell
the public the truth.

13:02.556 --> 13:05.190
Short his stock,
seize the glory.

13:05.225 --> 13:07.108
Bet against Gage, shake the
shareholders' confidence

13:07.144 --> 13:08.443
until their stock tanks.

13:08.479 --> 13:10.445
She knows what
to do, boo-boo.

13:10.481 --> 13:12.113
Then she also knows

13:12.149 --> 13:14.866
that Ellis'll never see it coming.
It's time to shut him down.

13:14.902 --> 13:16.368
Shut him down.
Down.

13:16.403 --> 13:18.036
(sighs)

13:18.071 --> 13:20.372
Goddamn.

13:20.407 --> 13:22.707
You know, I never considered
a threesome

13:22.743 --> 13:24.709
until this very moment.

13:24.745 --> 13:26.878
Of course, since this
information stands to bring home

13:26.914 --> 13:28.880
truckloads of "fuck you
money" to Global...

13:28.916 --> 13:31.216
Yeah, we're thinking that
a $22 million cash infusion

13:31.251 --> 13:32.717
into the coffers of K and A,

13:32.753 --> 13:33.969
that's an appropriate
"thank you."

13:34.004 --> 13:35.637
Hmm.

13:35.672 --> 13:38.306
I'll think about it.

13:38.342 --> 13:40.642
And, for the record, I've had
"fuck you money" since the '90s.

13:40.677 --> 13:42.060
(chuckles)

13:42.095 --> 13:43.936
HARVEY: Well, there was
a lot of talk back then

13:43.981 --> 13:45.597
about me going pro.

13:45.649 --> 13:47.899
Uh, bidding wars,
that sort of thing.

13:47.935 --> 13:49.901
But the fact of the matter is--
not every guy

13:49.937 --> 13:51.653
with a 93 mile per
hour fastball needs

13:51.688 --> 13:53.104
to have that kind of
validation, you understand?

13:53.106 --> 13:54.272
WOMAN:
Cool.

13:54.324 --> 13:55.407
Clyde!

13:55.442 --> 13:56.575
Clyde, my boy!

13:56.610 --> 13:58.243
I'm six inches away, okay?

13:58.278 --> 14:00.779
Here are a couple of lovely
ladies I've just met.

14:00.831 --> 14:01.947
You know what?
As a matter of fact,

14:01.949 --> 14:02.948
don't worry about it.

14:02.950 --> 14:04.332
Forget it.
Okay, thanks.

14:04.368 --> 14:06.334
You know, some sons, finding out

14:06.370 --> 14:08.620
that their father had aggressive
untreatable cancer,

14:08.672 --> 14:10.338
might be inclined
to drop everything,

14:10.374 --> 14:12.674
you know, and stand by his side.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.092
My son, uh,

14:14.127 --> 14:15.760
not quite so interested.

14:17.464 --> 14:20.131
Mm... fuck you, guys.

14:20.183 --> 14:21.349
He's buying, I'm gone.

14:21.385 --> 14:23.018
Excuse me.
Excuse us, ladies.

14:23.053 --> 14:25.053
How are there so many fucking
people in this place?

14:25.055 --> 14:26.521
Wait a second, wait a second.
What?!

14:26.557 --> 14:28.306
What, I thought we were supposed
to be bonding or something.

14:28.358 --> 14:29.641
What do you think this is?

14:29.693 --> 14:31.943
I got a couple of dim-witted
tight-assed hotties

14:31.979 --> 14:33.445
on the hook for us.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.646
You just got to go ahead.

14:34.698 --> 14:35.814
The ball's in your court.

14:35.816 --> 14:38.533
Wow, this is my nightmare.

14:38.569 --> 14:39.868
This is my nightmare.

14:39.903 --> 14:41.870
I'm taking said ball,
and I'm going home.

14:41.905 --> 14:43.371
Jesus, for Christ's sakes.

14:43.407 --> 14:45.457
As if you're not trying
to do the same thing

14:45.492 --> 14:47.042
every single night.
That's totally different.

14:47.077 --> 14:49.160
How?
'Cause I'm 32, Dad!

14:49.212 --> 14:50.495
You know what?

14:50.547 --> 14:53.381
Not so long ago,
once upon a time, so was I.

14:54.751 --> 14:57.218
Come on, Clyde,
come on, come on back.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.006
You guys are incredible.

15:01.058 --> 15:02.507
Oh.
(laughs)

15:02.559 --> 15:04.009
(Harvey laughing)

15:04.061 --> 15:05.510
Are you serious?

15:05.512 --> 15:06.978
A giggle, that's how
you're gonna respond?

15:07.014 --> 15:09.230
Cancer.
Don't be a dick.

15:10.684 --> 15:12.684
(keyboard clacking)

15:15.856 --> 15:18.189
You look rested.

15:18.191 --> 15:20.525
Does euthanasia require
the patient's consent?

15:20.527 --> 15:22.527
Or can I just go for it?

15:22.529 --> 15:24.362
Why?

15:24.364 --> 15:26.364
Just a shitty fucking night.

15:26.366 --> 15:27.699
What happened?

15:30.704 --> 15:33.038
Look, either entertain me,
or let me work in peace.

15:34.424 --> 15:36.708
He's never gonna change.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.209
No one ever changes.

15:38.261 --> 15:40.712
That's a given.

15:40.764 --> 15:42.380
Who is "he"?

15:42.432 --> 15:45.383
"He" is Harvey Oberholt.

15:45.435 --> 15:49.054
50% of my DNA, 80% of my
current fucking problems.

15:49.106 --> 15:50.388
Yikes.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.024
He has this way of,
like, hypnotizing people

15:53.060 --> 15:54.359
into believing he gives a shit,

15:54.394 --> 15:56.111
and then he drops the hammer.

15:56.146 --> 15:58.113
Division-1 deadbeat.

15:58.148 --> 15:59.898
He bailed on your family?

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
Yeah, yeah, but in
the most sinister way.

16:01.902 --> 16:03.401
He never made a
clean break, right?

16:03.403 --> 16:05.236
Didn't have the decency
to just vaporize

16:05.238 --> 16:07.238
like other kids' fathers, no.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.740
No, he would wait
until the moment

16:08.742 --> 16:10.458
my mom and I had
forgotten about him.

16:10.494 --> 16:13.578
Until we had put together
the remaining pieces

16:13.630 --> 16:14.913
and created something decent,

16:14.965 --> 16:16.581
and then that is
when he would come in

16:16.633 --> 16:19.718
and just fucking
shatter everything.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.088
Just like that.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.756
You know what?
Look...

16:26.309 --> 16:27.926
This is my dad's example

16:27.978 --> 16:32.147
of adult father-son
bonding.

16:32.182 --> 16:34.766
- Oh, no. Oh. - Yeah, there's more if you'd
like to flip through them.

16:34.818 --> 16:36.434
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.

16:37.437 --> 16:39.154
Oh, my God. Is he...?

16:39.189 --> 16:41.239
Motorboating
a handi-capable retiree?

16:41.274 --> 16:42.574
Yes, he is, Kels.

16:42.609 --> 16:43.658
Why would you think
he doesn't do that?

16:43.694 --> 16:44.909
Of course he does things
like that.

16:44.945 --> 16:46.661
Fuck, Clyde.

16:46.697 --> 16:49.581
Yeah, well, at least now
I know how it all ends for me.

16:49.616 --> 16:52.667
(laughs)

16:52.703 --> 16:53.785
Oh, come on.

16:53.837 --> 16:55.086
What? What?

16:55.122 --> 16:57.122
Dude, seriously?

16:57.124 --> 16:59.541
Clyde, you are so not
your shit-bag dad.

16:59.593 --> 17:00.759
How would you know?

17:00.794 --> 17:02.677
Because you keep giving
your shitbag dad chances

17:02.713 --> 17:04.179
not to be shitbagish.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.797
And because it actually
hurts you when he is.

17:05.799 --> 17:08.767
It means you've got a real,
functional heart in there.

17:08.801 --> 17:10.185
It's just buried

17:10.220 --> 17:12.303
under all that bravado
and coconut hair wax.

17:12.305 --> 17:14.138
It's pineapple, actually.

17:14.191 --> 17:16.141
Yeah, of course.

17:16.143 --> 17:17.809
I mean, coconut,
that would be super girly.

17:17.810 --> 17:18.859
Super girly, you know.

17:18.895 --> 17:20.135
Why would you even say it then?

17:20.146 --> 17:21.980
Of course it's not.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.366
It's a cool tie, though.

17:27.404 --> 17:29.704
Thanks.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.539
It's cotton.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:44.387 --> 17:46.254
Your lip thing.

17:46.306 --> 17:48.173
Can you take it out?
I don't even know if that's a possibility.

17:48.175 --> 17:49.724
Yeah, yeah, I can take it out.
Yeah?

17:49.760 --> 17:52.177
Yeah. (laughs)
That feels weird when you put it...

17:55.649 --> 17:57.015
(moans softly)

17:59.269 --> 18:01.903
We can't go back to my place because
my father has the key, so...

18:01.938 --> 18:04.022
Well, it will take an hour
to get back to my apartment.

18:04.074 --> 18:06.357
Do you really want to give me
that much time to change my mind?

18:06.409 --> 18:08.693
That is a fair point.
Let's, um...

18:08.745 --> 18:10.245
Um...

18:10.280 --> 18:12.197
Oh, uh, no, I got it, I got it.

18:12.199 --> 18:14.449
(moaning softly)

18:14.501 --> 18:16.201
We'll have to go this way
to get in...

18:16.203 --> 18:18.002
(Kelsey laughs)

18:23.093 --> 18:25.210
No, no, no, no, leave your tie on.
The tie on?

18:25.262 --> 18:26.761
Yeah, yes, ma'am.

18:27.798 --> 18:29.380
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

18:29.432 --> 18:31.382
Ooh! Shit.
Ooh.

18:31.434 --> 18:33.518
Just go there.
Jesus Christ.

18:33.553 --> 18:35.687
(laughing)

18:35.722 --> 18:37.105
(both laughing)

18:40.143 --> 18:41.693
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

18:41.728 --> 18:42.977
(laughing)

18:43.029 --> 18:44.229
I can't...

18:47.234 --> 18:48.700
I can't...
No, I want a little bit,

18:48.735 --> 18:49.901
I want a little bit.
I can't take it off.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.903
Okay, now we'll go do yours.

18:52.823 --> 18:53.788
Good for you!

18:53.824 --> 18:55.824
Yeah.

18:58.161 --> 19:00.128
(people exclaiming on TV)

19:00.163 --> 19:01.462
This is better than porn.

19:01.498 --> 19:03.581
It's like porn
and Shark Week combined.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.133
DENNA: Gage Motors
betrayed the public trust

19:05.168 --> 19:07.552
and gambled
with consumers' lives.

19:07.587 --> 19:09.804
Mark, simply stated,
Ellis Hightower is a predator.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.422
She is good.

19:11.424 --> 19:12.590
His behavior is abhorrent

19:12.642 --> 19:14.592
and the people deserve to know.

19:14.644 --> 19:16.928
My team turned over
all our evidence to both the SEC

19:16.930 --> 19:18.930
and the Federal Trade Commission.
DOUG: Oh...

19:18.982 --> 19:20.899
She is scary.
MARTY: Right?

19:20.934 --> 19:22.567
This Halloween,
I'm going as Denna Altshuler.

19:22.602 --> 19:23.268
Yeah.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.103
And we have just given her

19:25.105 --> 19:26.604
controlling interest
in our company, guys.

19:26.656 --> 19:28.296
(phone chimes)
Marty, can I talk to you...

19:28.325 --> 19:29.490
Do, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:29.526 --> 19:31.659
Denna, Denna, Denna.

19:31.695 --> 19:33.661
Yes, we're watching.

19:33.697 --> 19:34.779
(laughs)

19:34.781 --> 19:37.282
Yes, I'm fully engorged.

19:37.334 --> 19:38.333
(laughing)

19:38.368 --> 19:40.285
Because you guys keep asking

19:40.337 --> 19:42.837
and asking, yes, I did in fact

19:42.873 --> 19:46.624
make sweet, sweet fuck
to Kelsey last night.

19:46.626 --> 19:48.793
Gross.
On Marty's office couch.

19:48.845 --> 19:50.428
Gross.
Yeah.

19:50.463 --> 19:51.629
It is gross.

19:51.631 --> 19:53.431
But like...
like in a good way.

19:53.466 --> 19:55.800
Is it weird to say that?
I... I think she may be the one.

19:55.802 --> 19:58.469
It's very weird. Yeah.
Yeah?

19:58.471 --> 19:59.854
Hats off to you, buddy.
Ach.

19:59.890 --> 20:00.972
Oh, I was not expecting that.

20:01.024 --> 20:02.807
I mean, is that true?

20:02.859 --> 20:03.808
It is 100% true.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.443
Great.
It's weird though.

20:05.478 --> 20:06.611
It feels so real.
The whole thing felt

20:06.646 --> 20:07.979
so real.
I mean, yeah,

20:08.031 --> 20:11.282
she's bizarre and kinda bitchy,
but... I'm into it.

20:11.318 --> 20:13.151
I'm really into it.
Wow.

20:13.203 --> 20:14.619
Oh, Little Clydey Oberholt's
growing up

20:14.654 --> 20:15.787
right before our very eyes.

20:15.822 --> 20:17.705
MARTY:
Well,

20:17.741 --> 20:21.292
thanks to some very masterful
work from Big Daddy Kaan,

20:21.328 --> 20:23.661
that Gage stock is in freefall.

20:23.713 --> 20:24.996
(groans)
Oh.

20:24.998 --> 20:27.382
Ellis Hightower is no doubt
shitting his skinny jeans

20:27.417 --> 20:31.386
and $22 million is on
its way from Global.

20:31.421 --> 20:32.804
Yah, yah, yah.
You know I think?

20:32.839 --> 20:34.672
I think I need
a slow clap, bitches.

20:34.724 --> 20:36.307
Let's go, uh,

20:36.343 --> 20:37.809
and then,
and then we let it build

20:37.844 --> 20:40.845
until, uh, as you clap, as you clap...
(Clyde grunts)

20:40.897 --> 20:43.398
And while we're celebrating,

20:43.433 --> 20:45.016
let's give it up for Clyde
who had sloppy sex

20:45.018 --> 20:46.901
all over Marty's office couch
last night.

20:46.937 --> 20:49.654
La... 'kay, well, no, no-no-no.

20:49.689 --> 20:51.856
The conference table
is too hard,

20:51.858 --> 20:53.157
and you know the kitchen
is way too drafty.

20:53.193 --> 20:54.713
Okay? I had no other
place to take her.

20:54.744 --> 20:56.327
I was just trying to be a gentleman
so I fucked her on your couch.

20:56.363 --> 20:57.528
Every time you sit
on that couch,

20:57.580 --> 20:58.997
you will now be surrounded

20:59.032 --> 21:01.032
by millions of teeny tiny Clydes

21:01.084 --> 21:02.533
dried into the fabric.

21:02.585 --> 21:03.868
Forever.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.360
Why-why-why...
why would you do that?

21:05.372 --> 21:06.973
Why don't you have sex
on your own couch?

21:07.007 --> 21:08.589
Well, we work on my couch.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.375
Mm...

21:10.427 --> 21:11.759
MARTY: So you come on my
couch, you work on your couch.

21:11.795 --> 21:13.544
Get in my office, drag that

21:13.546 --> 21:14.712
fucking thing into the lobby

21:14.764 --> 21:16.347
and call the hazmat team.
Do it right now.

21:16.383 --> 21:18.716
For real? Just...
Do it right know, you skinny fucker.

21:18.768 --> 21:20.768
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Of course. (laughing)

21:20.804 --> 21:22.387
I actually need this couch.
Really?

21:22.439 --> 21:24.055
At home, yeah.
Do you want it?

21:26.893 --> 21:28.476
(clears throat)

21:28.528 --> 21:30.445
Hey, Doug.
(shushing)

21:38.038 --> 21:39.120
(quietly):
Okay.

21:39.155 --> 21:42.073
Um... so just a heads up,

21:42.125 --> 21:44.325
the word is that you slept
with Clyde last night.

21:44.377 --> 21:46.411
I know, just office gossip.

21:46.463 --> 21:47.745
Vicious.

21:47.797 --> 21:49.547
"Good afternoon, Kelsey.

21:49.582 --> 21:50.965
"I like your makeup.

21:51.001 --> 21:52.917
"Most girls can't pull off a
day-friendly winged eyeliner,

21:52.969 --> 21:54.135
but you really make it work."

21:54.170 --> 21:56.170
(chuckles)

21:56.222 --> 21:57.422
So, did you or did you not?

21:57.474 --> 21:59.140
I did.
(sighs)

21:59.175 --> 22:00.391
My God, you should have
come to me first.

22:00.427 --> 22:01.559
For tips?

22:01.594 --> 22:02.760
Look, Kelsey,

22:02.812 --> 22:04.095
here it is.

22:04.097 --> 22:05.730
How do I put this?

22:05.765 --> 22:06.886
Clyde is not the kind of guy

22:06.900 --> 22:08.099
that you want
to get involved with.

22:08.101 --> 22:09.317
Trust me.

22:09.352 --> 22:11.152
Doug, you basically
threw him at me.

22:11.187 --> 22:13.771
No, I don't...
"Clyde's a really good guy.

22:13.823 --> 22:15.656
He really likes you."
I-I was joking.

22:15.692 --> 22:17.775
You were right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,

22:17.827 --> 22:19.660
that is not what I meant at all.

22:19.696 --> 22:21.112
Clyde is terrible!

22:21.114 --> 22:22.780
He's the worst person
I've ever met.

22:22.782 --> 22:24.999
All right, plus
he gets colds a lot,

22:25.035 --> 22:26.617
so I'd check my HIV
status if I were you.

22:26.619 --> 22:27.785
It's a good thing to do anyway.

22:27.787 --> 22:30.121
I really liked sleeping with you,
Great.

22:30.123 --> 22:32.123
but you got weird and shame-y about it.
I don't remember that.

22:32.175 --> 22:33.925
Now, if you've had
a change of heart,

22:33.960 --> 22:35.843
let's be adults.

22:35.879 --> 22:37.119
I am open to fucking you again.

22:37.130 --> 22:38.379
Yes, oh, my...
Okay.

22:38.431 --> 22:40.098
That was what I was
going to suggest.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.550
Thank you. Yes, oh, God, you just made me
Okay. No.

22:42.602 --> 22:43.968
so happy.
(laughs)

22:43.970 --> 22:45.136
You smell great.

22:45.188 --> 22:47.138
You and me make
so much more sense.

22:47.140 --> 22:48.806
All right.
(claps hands together)

22:48.808 --> 22:51.309
So, we just have to find a way
to let Clyde down easy.

22:51.361 --> 22:52.810
You want to tell him?

22:52.862 --> 22:54.479
No, dude, just
'cause you want back in

22:54.531 --> 22:56.531
doesn't mean I'm going
to stop sleeping with Clyde.

22:57.317 --> 23:00.151
But... we could all
do it together

23:00.203 --> 23:02.153
if that makes you two
more comfortable.

23:02.155 --> 23:03.237
I'm flexible.

23:03.289 --> 23:04.489
(exhales)

23:04.491 --> 23:05.907
Uh...

23:05.959 --> 23:08.326
Yeah, I don't know if that's
going to work for me.

23:08.378 --> 23:10.578
It's not a hard no, but...
Holy shit. Blowtorch.

23:10.630 --> 23:13.381
DOUG:
Oh, my God.

23:13.416 --> 23:14.749
(people exclaiming)

23:14.801 --> 23:15.967
All right.

23:16.002 --> 23:17.468
ELLIS: Everyone, gather round
the couch fire.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.053
I've got you.
We're going to make some

23:19.089 --> 23:20.888
fucking s'mores.
I got this. I got this.

23:20.924 --> 23:22.390
DOUG:
Oh, God.

23:24.177 --> 23:25.893
ELLIS: Where the fuck are you?!
Oh, God.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.261
(Ellis grunting, woman yells)

23:27.313 --> 23:29.430
You treasonous shit stain!
Where are you?!

23:29.482 --> 23:31.432
Fuck this!

23:31.484 --> 23:32.683
MARTY:
Ell-Jeezy!

23:32.685 --> 23:34.652
Is that smoldering Clyde jizz?
I know it was you!

23:34.687 --> 23:36.320
My company's stock is in
the goddamn fucking toilet!

23:36.356 --> 23:37.572
I gave you life.

23:37.607 --> 23:38.689
I will destroy you.

23:38.691 --> 23:40.191
No, no, no, no, no.

23:40.193 --> 23:41.425
I will bury you!

23:44.581 --> 23:46.364
You seem very stressed.
So stressed.

23:46.416 --> 23:47.582
You know, my sister's
an energy healer.

23:47.617 --> 23:48.950
I could put you guys in touch.

23:49.002 --> 23:50.084
That would help.
Yeah, you got to look her up.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.285
The same mega-cunt

23:51.337 --> 23:53.087
trashing my company
all over cable news

23:53.123 --> 23:56.257
just happens to dump a load of
cash into Kaan and Associates?

23:56.292 --> 23:57.792
And you're gonna tell me
it's a coincidence?

23:57.844 --> 23:59.877
No. I am going to tell you that

23:59.879 --> 24:01.279
there's no proof that
it's <i> not</i> a coincidence.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.714
Shut the fuck up!
He didn't even really listen to the answer.

24:03.766 --> 24:05.049
You want to play?
CLYDE: That's not yours.

24:05.101 --> 24:07.468
You want to play, Marty?
Oh, no...

24:07.520 --> 24:09.804
Yeah, that's right.
we are out of kombucha tea.

24:09.856 --> 24:10.888
Are we?

24:10.890 --> 24:12.440
Did you get any? You...?
None.

24:12.475 --> 24:13.724
I didn't.
Bristol Farms run?

24:13.726 --> 24:15.943
Let's do it.
I'm down, let's do it.

24:15.979 --> 24:17.478
Douglas?

24:17.530 --> 24:19.147
We're going to the store.
Love that.

24:19.199 --> 24:20.815
Hey, and don't worry, Brokey,
I'll buy you another laptop.

24:20.867 --> 24:22.316
(Ellis yelling indistinctly)
Wait, that was my laptop?

24:22.368 --> 24:23.901
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Doug, Doug, Doug.

24:23.953 --> 24:26.070
I'll get you a kombucha. I'll get you a kombucha.
That's all I had left.

24:26.122 --> 24:27.655
Doug, Doug. (Doug sighs)
ELLIS: Oh!

24:27.707 --> 24:28.987
DOUG:
Hey, did you see, I helped?

24:28.992 --> 24:30.241
MARTY: You sure did.
Did you see that?

24:30.293 --> 24:32.410
(grunting)

24:34.497 --> 24:36.631
(sighs)
Okay...

24:36.666 --> 24:38.082
(grunts) God...
Okay.

24:38.117 --> 24:41.169
(laughs, sighs)
(sighs)

24:41.221 --> 24:44.922
You know, for an unrelentingly
self-involved bastard,

24:44.974 --> 24:47.975
you are notably generous
in the cunnilingus department.

24:48.011 --> 24:49.810
Thank you?

24:49.846 --> 24:51.095
Mm...

24:51.097 --> 24:52.763
(laughs)

24:52.815 --> 24:54.765
It's a new day, Marty Kaan.

24:54.817 --> 24:57.401
Fuck yes, it is.

24:57.437 --> 24:59.270
Oh, God.
Mm, mm.

24:59.322 --> 25:01.939
Granted, your boy was on
the ropes there for a second,

25:01.941 --> 25:03.574
but a big dick baller

25:03.610 --> 25:05.610
always finds his way
back to the throne.

25:05.662 --> 25:07.578
It's nice when dreams
work out, huh?

25:07.614 --> 25:08.613
Yeah.

25:08.665 --> 25:10.948
You wanted me to own you...

25:10.950 --> 25:13.117
and now I do.

25:13.119 --> 25:15.620
(moans)

25:15.622 --> 25:18.089
(sighs)
