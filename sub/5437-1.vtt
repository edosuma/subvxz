09:20.920 --> 09:22.880
I can't get any more.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.360
Get them on your side.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.320
What do you mean?
How do you do that?

09:30.320 --> 09:34.040
Do something for them, a small job.
Something easy.

Nothing to worry about.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.760
You could go tomorrow morning.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.920
I think if you did that

09:58.920 --> 10:02.040
they would look upon your situation
very differently.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.680
What was she asking you to do?
Don't.

How much do you owe?
Stop it.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.960
How much does she owe you?
A lot.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.000
Please stop it, Sean.
Think about what I said, Alice.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.880

Told you to stop spending money
you don't have.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.200
How much do you owe? Tell me.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.320
Stop it.
No. No, Alice!

10:41.320 --> 10:43.840
How much?
I'm not a child, Sean!

10:43.840 --> 10:46.280
Maybe you should stop
acting like one. How fucking much?

10:46.280 --> 10:48.040
Why do you want to know?

10:48.040 --> 10:49.880
Do you understand
what she was talking about?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.520
Or what she actually wants you
to do? It's not a game, Alice.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.400
You know, she's not kidding.
She fucking meant it!

10:56.400 --> 10:59.120
How much? Fucking tell me, Alice!
How much?!

10:59.120 --> 11:00.560
£8,000.

just kept giving me more money.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.920
Said it was no problem, no hassle,

11:31.920 --> 11:34.360
that I could take my time
paying it back.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.400

You're not going
to Amsterdam, Alice.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.760
No way.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.960
You. You're late.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.560
Come with me.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.560
Keep this place sparkling clean
and keep your mouth shut.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.680
I'll be back to check.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.480
Remember, I've got a hundred Poles
who want this job,

12:35.480 --> 12:36.680

We only need a few minutes

14:52.960 --> 14:55.920
We're here to make a proposal,
an offer.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.480
He looks worried.
Don't be. It's very simple.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.240
We want to play a game.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.440

15:15.440 --> 15:18.360
Which could be yours.
That's right, Sean. Yours.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.240
All you have to do
is hide from 9pm tonight.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.080
What do you mean, hide?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.920
You hide... We seek.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.320
And if we don't find you...
Then you get to keep it.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.520

It's yours.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.000
You'll never see us again.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.200
But if we do find you
in those 12 hours,
then all you have to do...

15:34.200 --> 15:35.840
Is give the money and the key back.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.800
What is this?
Who are you? I don't understand.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.640
Take this number.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.080
But you must call
before 9:00 tonight.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.280
£12,000, Sean.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.160
That's a lot of money.
Could clear a lot of debt.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.480
Have you seen it?
Seen what?

16:11.480 --> 16:12.560
A cigarette case.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.280
No use asking him.
He was asleep when I came in.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.480
Now, the case itself is worthless,
but my wife gave it to me years ago.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.520
I'm really sorry about this.
I, er, maybe left it in the taxi.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.360
Why don't you
sit back at your table

16:24.360 --> 16:25.840

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.000
The job is yours, if you want it.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.000
The job?

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.000
No. Fuck the job.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.720
We can't just walk away from this.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.760
Anyway, she saw us.
The kid, Sean. His friend, Sam.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.240
They all saw us.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.160
Nobody cares about what they saw.
'They' don't exist.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.480
You're serious?

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.080
Do you really give a shit about her?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.000
The truth. Tell the truth.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.160
Do you?

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.800
Yes, I do.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.880
LAUGHS

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.840
You're so fucking...

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.720
..middle-class, Jamie, so fake.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.480
Why the fuck
would you care about her?

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.480
She's already dead, you...fool.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.080
Oh.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.120
Don't tell me it's about morals
and souls and fucking angels.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.600
I mean, shit to that.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.680
Shit to all of that!

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.080
LAUGHS: If you don't like
What you're see,

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.160
then you should do
what the good book tells you,

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.160
and pluck your
fucking eyes out, and...

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.680
GUNSHOT

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.840

ALICE WHIMPERS

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.760

Alice?

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.400
CRIES SOFTLY

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.960
What did they do to you, Alice?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.640
Alice.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.960
SHE CRIES

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.120
Alice, what have they done to you?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.240
SHE CRIES:
He...

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.520
CRIES LOUDLY

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.200
Shh.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.880
Sorry.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.880
SIREN WAILS

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.320
They're still here.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.440
By the garages.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.359
AEROPLANE WHOOSHES

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.080
MAN: Can I help you?

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.319
SEAN: I hope so.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:52.800
I'm here to meet Jamie Stewart.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.760
I've got some documents
he wants dealt with today.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.399
He asked me to meet him here
so he could sign them off.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.000
There's no-one in this morning.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.680
Uh, he is. He called me from here.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.479
I assure you there's no-one in,
apart from me and the cleaners.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.960
I'm sorry. He called me from here.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.439
He called me out of bed,
he shouted at me.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:13.399
He said Alistair would go crazy
if it wasn't done.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.080
You know how he is.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.359
I'm here. I've got the documents.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.840
Can I go and have a look?
I'm sorry.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.399
Like I said before, there's nobody
here. They would have passed me.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:25.200
What, even if they
were working all night?

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.640
I don't think there was anyone
working late last night.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.240
Cos, er, you'd have seen them
on your rounds, right?

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.040
Right.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.359
Look, between you and me,

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.840
I don't give a shit.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.640
I get paid anyway.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.120
But if he's up there, and he
doesn't get these documents,

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.560
and I tell him why,

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.760
whoa, you can imagine
what might happen, eh?

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.040
Just wait here.
I'll go check upstairs.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.520
Sure.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.920
Wake me up if I fall asleep, yeah?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.480
THUD!

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.360
Everything OK there, sir?

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.640
Sure.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.600
There's something
hanging out of there.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.160
Looks like a shirt or something.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.360
The boot.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.080
INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.200

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.880
Have a good day.

Come on. Pass it over here to me.
Mmm, no.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.120
No, no, no, no, no.
No. No, don't do that.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.400
Look.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.800
I'll swap ya.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.160

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.040

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.200
GIRLS CONTINUE TO GIGGLE

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.680
I'm going to have to
eat them all, then.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.200
None for you.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.240
Come on. Give me the gun.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.080
Yeah, pass it through to me.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.560
GIRL WHISPERS: Pass it.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.240
Good. There you go.

It was fun, wasn't it?

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.440
Why me?

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.400
Why Alice?
Shh. Don't be scared.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600

I've got it all here.

Everything's here ready to go,

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.800
to be sent to everyone
who knows you.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.440
They'll see what you've been doing.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.680
The others.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.240
All the others.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.640
You hunted them
and you killed them.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.880
Come away from there.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.480
Let's, er...let's talk about it.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.480
Do a deal. What do you think?

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.760
Put the gun down

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.160
and step away from me.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.680
How much do you need?

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.880
Why did you do that to my sister?

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.840
Oh, I can give you
more money than you ever dreamed of.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.440
I can do that quickly.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.000
I need to know.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.680
It doesn't matter now.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.320
Oh, no, it does.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.640
It really does.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.120
Do we have a deal?

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.040
If you tell me.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.560
I did it because...

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.800
Yeah?

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.760
..because I could.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.080
And that was it? No other reason?

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.160
All this tonight...
because you could.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.640
Let's make you rich.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:59.080
Do...the...deal.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.720
No.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.160

SONG: # Half the kids
That you grew up with

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.240
# Were pushing prams by the time
that they were just 16

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.720
# If love is a drug
then where is the cure

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.280
# For the girl who used
to talk to you about her dream?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.280
# And all the boys
with all their toys

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.920
# Couldn't see the signs as we
scorched out eyes with nicotine

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.240
# And the grown-up said
Listen to your heads

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.960
# But our hearts were crying out
for heroes on TV screens

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.800
# Now this song is about you

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.000
# Now this song is about

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.800
# Changes in your mind

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.000
# Changes in your life

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.800
# Changes in the times

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.120
# And the reason
you can't sleep at night

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.560
# Changes in your mind

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.600
# Changes in your life

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.480
# Changes in the times

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.600
# And the reason
you gave up the fight... #

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.720
SAM: It's all there.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.280
I didn't touch a penny.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.520
Alice is at the hospital.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.160
She's going to be OK.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.000
I spoke to her.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.480
I didn't know, Sean.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.360
They gave me some money.
told me it was a game.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.240
I didn't know
they were going to do that.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.800
I'm so sorry.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.480
I'm so sorry.
