00:22.130 --> 00:23.520
Damn!

00:30.430 --> 00:33.000
Dispatch 88,
in pursuit of a vehicle.

00:33.010 --> 00:36.360
Plates match missing
blue Honda, Highway 227.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.050
This is 71 joining pursuit,
request additional back-up.

00:43.770 --> 00:46.390
Come on. Come on!

00:46.400 --> 00:47.910
What a piece of crap.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.230
Damn!

00:52.500 --> 00:55.590
Driver, pull your vehicle over!

01:00.660 --> 01:04.310
Driver, turn off your vehicle
and stay where you are.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.590
driver!

01:10.600 --> 01:14.010
Put your hands outside the
vehicle where we can see them!

01:23.380 --> 01:27.420
turn off the radio and reach
your hands outside the window!

01:30.430 --> 01:32.550
hands!

01:39.990 --> 01:41.960
both hands, now!

01:45.150 --> 01:47.100
- Now, slowly...
- Grenade!

01:47.110 --> 01:48.510
Get back!

02:01.290 --> 02:02.450
Call for an ambulance.

02:02.460 --> 02:05.150
Officer down! Officer down!

02:05.520 --> 02:09.490
A popular theory among leading astrophysicists
estimates that the hyper matter reactor

02:09.500 --> 02:13.610
would need about 10 to the 32nd jewels of
energy to destroy a planet the size of earth.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.210
Now, Lucas said it took 19 years to
build the first death star, right?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.030
But if you look at the
new essential chronology,

02:19.040 --> 02:20.990
there's a test bed prototype
for a super laser that spans-

02:21.000 --> 02:22.340
where are you goin'?

02:22.350 --> 02:25.290
Taking back the last
5 minutes of my life.

02:25.850 --> 02:26.920
You can't go in there.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.300
Don't you want to know about this guy?

02:28.310 --> 02:29.810
I do.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.700
Got it all memorized-
his books, his bio.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.740
Yeah, books have sold
over a million copies.

02:33.750 --> 02:34.630
So?

02:34.640 --> 02:38.010
There's a million reasons not to
come back, if you know what I'm sayin'.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.020
Taupe walls.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.410
That's a negative color.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.120
Cold, distant.

02:46.130 --> 02:48.920
You know,emotionally,taupe
is linked to loneliness

02:48.930 --> 02:51.520
and the desire to escape from the world.

02:51.530 --> 02:55.190
I just figured the guy's walls would be
covered with plaques and commendations.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.480
Maybe he doesn't want to be
reminded of past victories.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.720
It's a new chapter for him.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.970
What happened to the moratorium
on inter-team profiling, guys?

03:01.980 --> 03:03.870
Come on, Reid, team?

03:03.880 --> 03:06.660
I don't think this guy knows
the meaning of the word.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.390
Oh,I found something.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.310
Looks like some type
of religious religous art.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.180
Original, maybe?

03:13.190 --> 03:14.540
Definitely expensive.

03:14.550 --> 03:15.980
It's renaissance art.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.940
- If that's original...
- is it?

03:17.950 --> 03:20.420
I don't know, it’s kinda hard to tell.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.590
Means he's into the classics.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.910
What else?

03:23.920 --> 03:26.510
Uh, Italian, strict Catholic upbringing.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.710
Probably believes in redemption.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.590
Well, I believe in a lot of things.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.570
Catholic, yes.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.210
Italian-american,52 years.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.340
Strict upbringing, not so much.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.880
Now, the artwork, that’s
15th century, original.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.590
Cost more than my first house.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.820
And as for the wall
color, it’s just a base coat.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.730
Painters will come in
and finish tomorrow.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.950
Now, if you're all finished, I think
J.J. And Hotch are ready for us.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.700
Isn't that how a team works?

04:07.350 --> 04:08.410
Great falls, Montana.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.250
Over the past 14 months,3 women
have been reported missing.

04:12.260 --> 04:16.720
Michelle Lawford, Jennifer
Hillbridge, and Darcy Cranwell.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.640
All young Caucasian brunettes.

04:18.649 --> 04:22.850
After an extensive search, all were
presumed dead by local authorities.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.330
So at least we know he has a type.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.700
And now there's a fourth
woman, Angela Miller.

04:26.710 --> 04:30.690
This morning, she and her car went
missing from a small grocery store

04:30.700 --> 04:32.700
while her husband and son were inside.

04:32.710 --> 04:33.750
This morning?

04:33.760 --> 04:36.730
Montana's requesting our help?

04:37.690 --> 04:41.170
40 minutes later, state troopers spotted
Angela Miller's car on the highway.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.260
And when troopers tried
to apprehend the driver,

04:43.270 --> 04:45.370
he blew himself up with a grenade,

04:45.380 --> 04:47.210
putting one of the
troopers in the I.C.U.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.980
Are they sure that she
wasn't in the car with him?

04:48.990 --> 04:51.740
They went through the wreckage, and
it appears she's still missing.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.890
Troopers get a look at the guy?

04:52.900 --> 04:56.170
Caucasian,stocky,brown hair, moustache.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.120
Early forties.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.240
He has a scar on the
left side of his face.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.550
Do you think Angela
miller's still alive?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.550
Since the other missings were
never found, we don't know,

05:03.560 --> 05:07.250
but he only had her for 40
minutes, so we have to assume she is.

05:51.830 --> 05:56.290
Criminal Minds Season 03 Episode 07
"Identity"

05:58.570 --> 06:02.420
Earthly kingdom cannot exist
without inequality of persons.

06:02.430 --> 06:07.820
"Some must be free, some
serfs, some rulers, some subjects. "

06:07.830 --> 06:09.240
Martin Luther.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.870
You know, I could have gotten you
a coloring book at the airport.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.520
I'm creating a topographical map,

06:13.530 --> 06:17.300
weighing down and geocoding all key
locations looking for algorithms.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.240
Yeah.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.160
That's exactly what I
thought you were doing.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.770
It's called a jeopardy surface.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.710
It's a way of narrowing down
where the Unsub could reside.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.900
And by default, where he may
be stashing Angela miller.

06:27.910 --> 06:29.670
You know, it says here the
guy had a fully loaded gun,

06:29.680 --> 06:31.550
so we know he had
options. Why the grenade?

06:31.560 --> 06:33.480
He wants to be remembered.

06:33.490 --> 06:37.400
And he wanted to be sure to take
as many cops with him as possible.

06:37.410 --> 06:39.360
He knows he's out gunned.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.240
So he waits.

06:41.250 --> 06:44.220
Times it to the last second. Boom!

06:45.210 --> 06:48.160
There are some very committed
people in those parts.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.400
Who love their fire power.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.490
Almost as much as they hate us.

06:52.670 --> 06:53.650
Militia.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.000
And they're heavily armed.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.480
Yeah, but hand grenades?

06:57.490 --> 07:00.370
It's not uncommon for militia
members to have military experience.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.110
Often times, they resent the
structure and they get discharged,

07:03.120 --> 07:05.350
and they form their own
paramilitary governments.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.130
Dental records are on
their way to Garcia.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.920
I'll tell her to check
the military first.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.460
Prentiss and I will go meet the husband.

07:10.470 --> 07:12.270
I can walk the other abduction sights.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.080
Everybody else, set up base, work
on geographical profiles.

07:15.090 --> 07:18.200
Establish contact with the
locals, and tread carefully.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.360
They'll be watching us.

07:30.230 --> 07:33.490
He killed a 15-year police veteran.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.830
He died in I.C.U. a couple hours ago.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.770
Sorry to hear that.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.540
So Angela Miller came
out with the groceries

07:38.550 --> 07:41.190
while her husband took
mark into the bathroom.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.580
He came out, she was
gone, her and the car.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.720
Unsub gets into the car, gun
drawn, and tells her to drive.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.590
She knows her son's
coming out any minute,

07:49.600 --> 07:51.950
so to keep him out of
harm's way, she drives off.

07:51.960 --> 07:52.580
Where did he come from?

07:52.590 --> 07:55.100
All the vehicles in the
vicinity have been accounted for.

07:55.110 --> 07:58.000
Well, if he's a local, he walked.

07:59.350 --> 08:02.840
Well, these folks can rest easy
knowing the bastard's dead.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.610
Except, of course, for
Angela miller's family.

08:18.350 --> 08:21.170
Uh, this is Agent Jareau
with the F.B.I. And-

08:22.640 --> 08:24.820
that's the third time
I've been hung up on.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.470
Try not saying F.B.I.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.510
Who was that?

08:27.520 --> 08:29.580
Contact for a local militia newsletter.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.650
Yeah, drop the F.B.I. Part.

08:31.660 --> 08:32.880
A woman is missing.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.820
You'd think the espeople
would want to help us.

08:34.830 --> 08:35.880
They do want to help.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.970
The missing woman, not us.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.210
Go ahead, Garcia.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.990
You were spot on, crime fighters.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.390
Military records match.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.500
Francis goehring,42 years old.

08:47.510 --> 08:52.540
Did a year in the army for
a bad conduct discharge.

08:52.940 --> 08:57.310
Highlight of which was an
arrest during a bar brawl

08:57.320 --> 09:00.080
in which three other
people were hospitalized.

09:00.090 --> 09:03.510
He also appears in the
federal database for...

09:03.520 --> 09:06.140
get this, aggressive militia groups.

09:06.150 --> 09:07.930
Aggressive militia groups.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.110
Is there any other type?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.170
That's your federal government at work.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.000
We specialize in redundancy.

09:14.010 --> 09:15.850
You see a last known address?

09:15.860 --> 09:18.540
A compound just outside of town.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.070
It's coming your way.

09:20.940 --> 09:23.740
he also has a wife that
doesn't appear to live with him.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.870
Diane Marie Goehring,lives
in Shelby a few hours away.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.480
Have the state police bring in the wife.

09:28.490 --> 09:30.720
Reid and I will go make
friends with his neighbors.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.400
Thanks, Garcia.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.750
We need you to tell us what happened.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.490
The guy that took my wife...

09:40.860 --> 09:43.090
he took the other
missing women, didn’t he?

09:43.100 --> 09:45.220
He's a serial killer, that’s
why you're here?

09:45.230 --> 09:47.510
No, we’re here to help
you find your wife.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.140
You do believe she's alive?

09:49.150 --> 09:50.910
Unless I have evidence to the contrary,

09:50.920 --> 09:53.240
I very much consider her to be alive.

09:53.250 --> 09:56.440
I wouldn't have called him
in if I believed otherwise.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.140
What do you believe?

09:59.150 --> 10:01.330
I believe you spent all morning...

10:01.560 --> 10:04.880
going over and over in your head
about the last time you saw her.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.790
And asking yourself how could
it happen, why did it happen.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.640
Those moments, those memories,

10:12.650 --> 10:15.590
we need to hear them all, in detail.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.240
How's that gonna help save her?

10:19.250 --> 10:21.530
Well, in one of those moments,

10:22.480 --> 10:25.640
someone else may have
been watching her, too.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.010
What the hell do you want?

11:01.020 --> 11:01.920
Can't you read?

11:01.930 --> 11:04.180
I'm not a salesman, I’m with the FBI.

11:04.190 --> 11:05.580
FBI?

11:05.590 --> 11:06.950
You're not serious.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.000
You look like a pipe cleaner with eyes.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.710
I could snap you like a twig.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.370
But then, he isn't alone.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.420
We're here because this was the
address listed for Francis Goehring.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.740
I haven't seen him in months.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.090
We'd like to see his residence.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.650
Francis Goehring abducted 3 women.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.640
We're looking for a fourth.

11:26.530 --> 11:29.470
He took her while her husband
and son were in a store.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.320
This isn't about us, it’s about
a woman from your community.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.250
I'll show you his place.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.760
Piece of advice, pipe cleaner,

11:44.770 --> 11:46.540
way you're wearin' that gun...

11:47.190 --> 11:49.770
beggin' someone to take it off you.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.490
Mostly just junk mail.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.450
Catalogs for firearms...

12:14.520 --> 12:16.780
survival preparedness.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.700
He doesn't sleep here.

12:18.710 --> 12:20.070
Postmarks are new.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.810
He probably just uses
this address for mail.

12:22.820 --> 12:25.220
Odd choice of reading material.

12:25.230 --> 12:27.080
Uh,speaking of reading material,

12:27.090 --> 12:30.050
I've,uh,read all your books.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.460
Thanks.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.980
one thing that always kind
of struck me as odd is that

12:35.990 --> 12:40.330
you really just sort of
glance over ruby ridge.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.150
I mean, you don't- you
don't have to tell me, I...

12:50.240 --> 12:51.600
this picture seems old.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.910
It's part of a past life.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.320
We need to find where his new life is.

12:56.330 --> 12:58.380
How's that map of yours coming along?

12:58.390 --> 13:01.660
I've got it narrowed down
to about a 30 mile radius.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.840
Well, Hotch seems to
think he was on foot.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.970
That's a long walk.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.230
I'm still refining it.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.740
Good.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.070
Hello.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.670
Home movies.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.460
An earthly kingdom...

13:22.910 --> 13:26.390
cannot exist without the
inequality of persons.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.570
Martin Luther understood the
weak will always serve the strong.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.570
Like me.

13:33.710 --> 13:35.690
He had dreams.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.360
And ideas.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.940
It's funny, he uses the
chair like it's a throne

13:41.950 --> 13:45.660
and he's framing himself intentionally
with a low angle to give him power

13:45.670 --> 13:47.810
and dominance in the frame.

13:47.820 --> 13:52.060
In feudal times, the lord lived on
high ground to spot the invader.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.500
He had serfs to serve his kingdom.

13:55.510 --> 13:58.720
The lord never had to leave his castle.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.580
The serfs would bring him everything.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.800
They were the appendages of his will.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.880
There's 11 more tapes of this?

14:06.890 --> 14:08.600
It's his manifesto.

14:08.610 --> 14:12.170
First, I will build a compound, a kingdom.

14:12.450 --> 14:17.130
Second, I will arm, protect and
fortify my kingdom.

14:18.190 --> 14:22.090
Third, I will keep women as
serfs to serve my ever need.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.880
This is my right.

14:26.290 --> 14:29.440
As a man with free will in America,

14:29.980 --> 14:33.030
I will make my kingdom a reality.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.690
Well, we know he's
moved out of his house.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.840
My guess is that kingdom
is the reality now.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.970
Hey, he talks about
keeping women to serve him.

14:41.980 --> 14:45.370
It's possible all these
women are still alive.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.850
Excuse me.

14:46.860 --> 14:48.780
Goehring's wife is here.

14:48.790 --> 14:51.720
Thank you for coming to
speak with us, Mrs. Goehring.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.320
Did I have a choice?

14:53.330 --> 14:54.810
We need your help.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.950
If I don't have to be here, good-bye.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.920
Um,is this you?

14:58.930 --> 15:00.990
That is you, isn’t it?

15:03.700 --> 15:04.890
Where did you get this?

15:05.550 --> 15:08.020
Um,have you seen this woman?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.070
Today on the news.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.470
Well, you probably saw these
three women on the news as well,

15:14.480 --> 15:17.910
and we think they all
share one thing in common.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.330
What?

15:19.340 --> 15:21.610
They all look like you.

15:22.090 --> 15:23.880
A pattern, a type.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.050
You and all of these women fit a type.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.390
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.270
I...

15:37.380 --> 15:40.580
I haven't seen him
since we threw him out.

15:40.590 --> 15:41.960
We?

15:43.490 --> 15:45.420
The militia.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.150
They saw what- what he
did to me, and threw him out.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.310
What he did to you?

15:54.250 --> 15:56.960
Francis killed himself yesterday.

15:56.970 --> 15:58.610
He's-he's
dead?

15:58.620 --> 16:02.330
After being caught driving
Angela Miller's car.

16:02.340 --> 16:07.180
Can you think of anywhere that
he would have taken these women?

16:09.580 --> 16:11.380
Your husband was sadistic.

16:11.390 --> 16:14.450
He hurt you, made you do horrible things.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.300
He treated you like a slave.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.890
Did what he wanted, whenever he wanted.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.340
He did the same thing
to those other women,

16:21.350 --> 16:24.780
except they didn't have
the militia to save them.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.990
Francis said that his
dream started with 9 acres.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.360
What's he talking about?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.390
My parents' land.

16:38.220 --> 16:41.420
When-when-when they died, he
made me give it to him.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.030
Where is it?

16:56.540 --> 16:59.020
Sheriff, let me know when they've
swept the house for explosives.

16:59.030 --> 17:01.110
In the meantime, check the
perimeter. Let's find her.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.870
Tommy,2 men on the house.

17:02.880 --> 17:07.170
Angela?

17:07.180 --> 17:08.849
Angela Miller?

17:08.859 --> 17:10.260
Angela!

17:10.270 --> 17:11.530
Hotch!

17:11.540 --> 17:12.869
Rossi!

17:16.010 --> 17:17.359
We got her.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.220
It's Angela.

17:23.010 --> 17:24.500
She's gone.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.960
2 exit wounds, upper torso.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.450
I promised her son we'd find her alive.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.730
What is it?

17:37.740 --> 17:39.510
She's still warm.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.890
Look at the blood, it hasn't dried yet.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.820
This is recent.

17:42.830 --> 17:43.830
Very recent.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.490
How is that possible?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.590
Goehring didn't do this.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.820
He's got a partner.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.200
Angela's been dead for
no more than half an hour.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.490
The partner was just here.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.960
He can't have gotten far.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.810
We set up road blocks
within a 40 mile radius.

18:26.820 --> 18:29.270
Sheriff, somebody around here must
know who Goehring's partner is.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.800
We should try Goehring’s
pals, the militia.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.000
Maybe they can help.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.790
Militia leader is Harris Townsend.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.610
He owns a bar called the horse post.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.060
I'd suggest sending Morgan.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.130
What?

18:39.140 --> 18:42.400
All due respect, Rossi, but you've
got an entire team to pick from.

18:42.410 --> 18:43.750
You're choosing me?

18:43.760 --> 18:44.920
Are you serious?

18:44.930 --> 18:47.640
No offense, but do you
really want to do that?

18:47.650 --> 18:49.190
Take J.J. with you.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.400
They know we're here.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.830
But you're the last face they expect.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.960
Let's do it, J.J.

18:55.970 --> 18:57.520
Sheriff, we need to get into the house.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.310
Not until I get the all clear.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.640
Goehring blew himself up.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.000
God knows what else he's got in there.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.360
Search what you can until we get in.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.530
Anything to build a workable profile.

19:13.810 --> 19:15.050
Keeps everything neat.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.730
Obsessively so.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.710
His trailer was organized, but
this is different.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.210
Get back to me on it.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.890
We found some cartridges
and different casings.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.660
The gun racks were empty.
He took his entire arsenal.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.960
7.62 millimeter.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.190
He's got an assault rifle.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.560
And I found 2 sets of men's
shoes of different sizes.

19:35.570 --> 19:37.100
We found fresh tire tracks.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.240
Small pick-up truck.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.650
I know it doesn't narrow it down much,

19:39.660 --> 19:41.700
but let the troopers know they're
looking for a man in a pick-up.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.930
If he's as prepared as Goehring,

19:42.940 --> 19:44.930
he'll have a police
scanner and a 2-way radio.

19:45.230 --> 19:47.770
We can tune into the state
geological survey frequency.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.210
Nobody ever listens to that.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.950
Hey,guys?

19:53.310 --> 19:55.020
There are 3 sections of roses,

19:55.030 --> 19:57.550
different heights, different
levels of maturity.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.540
3 different women.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.220
These appear to be the
most recently planted.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.580
The tags are still on them.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.720
Guys...

20:06.970 --> 20:08.420
carrion beetles.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.340
Like in a cemetery.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.980
Sheriff, let’s get some shovels.
We need to start digging.

20:25.070 --> 20:26.990
This should be interesting.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.080
J.J., wait a minute.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
Stay behind me.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.500
When we get inside, do
not, whatever you do,

20:32.510 --> 20:33.960
turn your back on that
door. Do you hear me?

20:33.970 --> 20:35.940
I can handle myself.

20:53.490 --> 20:56.030
We're looking for Harris Townsend.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.700
Put your badge away.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.430
We know who you are.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.900
We're only here to
talk to Harris Townsend.

21:02.910 --> 21:04.820
We heard he runs this bar.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.590
I do.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.340
Talkin' isn't exactly what
you boys are known for.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.640
We're investigating
a missing woman-

21:10.650 --> 21:13.200
Bobby, be a gentleman.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.270
Pull up a chair for the little lady.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.730
No, I prefer to stand.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.390
I'd prefer it if you both left my bar.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.720
But we have manners.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.060
Glock 17.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.380
Tactical, but European.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.170
Smith and Wesson.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.320
Pure American hardware.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.220
I wonder which one is more dependable.

21:37.860 --> 21:41.090
I don't want to be here just as
much as you don't want me here.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.360
But we have a job to do.

21:43.850 --> 21:49.510
I never understood how someone
like you could trust them.

21:50.030 --> 21:50.880
Someone like me?

21:50.890 --> 21:54.760
How was the federal government
ever helped your people?

21:55.040 --> 21:58.510
Slavery, ghettos, poverty.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.670
The CIA got you all hooked
on heroin in the sixties,

22:01.680 --> 22:03.620
crack in the eighties.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.410
Now, I hate the government. But you...

22:08.460 --> 22:10.330
you should despise them.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.950
They sure as hell don't
care about you now.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.440
There are 5 other members of your team.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.390
Look around you.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.950
Why the hell did they send you in here?

22:24.270 --> 22:28.770
Francis Goehring and a partner
abducted and killed 4 innocent women,

22:29.530 --> 22:33.940
the last of which we just found dead in
a bed of roses, shot in the back twice.

22:33.950 --> 22:35.990
Nobody sent me anywhere.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.440
I came here to do right by her.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.820
Now, Goehring's partner
is out there somewhere,

22:39.830 --> 22:43.190
so we completely understand if you boys
are just too afraid to tell us about him.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.750
I get it.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.220
But just say so.

22:47.230 --> 22:49.040
Don't go hidin' behind your
vague little gun threats

22:49.050 --> 22:52.070
and your tired conspiracy
theories, please.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.020
Goehring was a piece of dung.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.780
I don't know who his partner is.

23:03.790 --> 23:08.110
I saw him once, through
the scope of my rifle.

23:08.450 --> 23:11.470
Me and some of the
boys were out huntin'.

23:11.790 --> 23:15.030
Small guy, about 5'8.

23:16.250 --> 23:20.070
Following Goehring around
like his private pack mule.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.130
Hat on, head down.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.570
That's it, that’s all I know.

23:37.030 --> 23:40.020
Just in case you
remember something else.

23:42.450 --> 23:44.430
Take care, boys.

23:47.100 --> 23:51.200
Didn't find any explosives, nothing
rigged, but be careful.

23:51.850 --> 23:53.040
Odd.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.960
Goehring kept his house almost cozy.

24:08.650 --> 24:10.420
- Hotch?
- Yeah.

24:13.390 --> 24:16.570
These tapes have the
names of the missing women.

24:16.690 --> 24:17.920
They've all been un-spooled.

24:17.930 --> 24:20.040
We need to get these
to Garcia immediately.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.040
Deputy.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.630
One, all actions must
serve to please the master.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.890
Two,insubordination will
result in punishment...

24:30.460 --> 24:32.070
this is his new manifesto.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.750
Notice the "Master" is
singular and capitalized,

24:34.760 --> 24:37.520
emphasizing there's only
one dominant partner.

24:37.530 --> 24:40.040
So his partner is more of a servant.

24:40.050 --> 24:41.040
Or a serf.

24:41.050 --> 24:44.550
Watching the house, minding the
lawn, helping him abduct women...

24:44.560 --> 24:48.690
ok,so if his partner is a
serf, what are the female slaves for?

24:48.700 --> 24:50.940
Oh,I think I can answer that.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.980
Now we know why the victims
were taken so far apart.

25:02.630 --> 25:05.380
They tortured them. It
took time for them to die.

25:05.390 --> 25:06.980
This is where he kept them.

25:06.990 --> 25:08.870
The blood's fresh.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.900
What the hell is this?

25:15.210 --> 25:17.860
The pear of anguish.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.310
I've got something here.

25:26.710 --> 25:29.240
Homemade torture tools.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.250
They covered the floor in something.

25:35.260 --> 25:38.260
The bodies are probably
wrapped in whatever it was.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.650
They must have kept these
women in that box for months,

25:42.020 --> 25:46.360
judging by these tools, there will be
a considerable amount of mutilation.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.700
We need to do what we can to help
their families give a proper burial.

25:54.650 --> 25:57.250
Goehring's partner is
early to mid-twenties.

25:57.260 --> 25:58.620
5'8".

25:58.630 --> 26:00.590
Slight build. Shy and retiring,

26:00.600 --> 26:04.190
but groomed by a separatist
armed with assault weaponry.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.330
Like Goehring, he's unlikely to
surrender if he's cornered.

26:07.340 --> 26:10.780
His obsession with cleanliness
and order is deeply ingrained.

26:10.790 --> 26:13.780
This will be reflected in
his home and his vehicle.

26:13.790 --> 26:16.960
We've located hair samples in
the cabin we believe are his,

26:16.970 --> 26:20.170
medium-short length and blonde.

26:22.860 --> 26:25.680
He's the submissive partner, but
having just lost Goehring-

26:25.690 --> 26:28.580
the man he was dedicated to
and heavily dependent upon-

26:28.870 --> 26:30.620
he's in crisis.

27:16.570 --> 27:18.360
One more
thing-

27:18.990 --> 27:22.050
never let the bastards take you alive.

27:23.230 --> 27:25.440
And never be forgotten.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.740
That's it. The whole tamale.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.990
Every horrific frame.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.080
I'm done.

27:35.090 --> 27:37.460
- No luck seeing the partner?
- No.

27:37.470 --> 27:39.610
He's- I scanned
every frame.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.180
He's holding the camera.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.390
You ok?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.480
No.

27:43.490 --> 27:45.000
I'm sorry.

27:48.330 --> 27:51.660
This is Jennifer Hillbridge, the
second woman abducted.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.070
Please, stop. Please. It hurts.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.220
What is it with you?

27:59.830 --> 28:02.430
You just don't get it, do you?

28:02.670 --> 28:04.530
Total power over your life.

28:04.540 --> 28:06.130
The cameraman frames Goehring,

28:06.140 --> 28:08.830
- but never her.
- Total power... I decide.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.510
Watch.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.360
He never stays on her that long.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.960
He's more interested in
Goehring than the torture.

28:14.970 --> 28:19.170
He's lingering on his biceps like
he's caressing Goehring’s body.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.380
Why the hell?

28:20.390 --> 28:23.860
The unspooled tapes - that
wasn't to destroy evidence.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.360
It was from jealousy.

28:26.370 --> 28:27.530
What?

28:27.540 --> 28:29.420
He's in love with Goehring.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.290
Make a loop.

28:32.300 --> 28:34.260
Tie it around. Bring it through.

28:34.270 --> 28:35.670
Goes through.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.400
He's teaching him how
to tie the perfect knot.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.700
A trucker's hitch.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.300
She's not going anywhere.

28:43.310 --> 28:45.260
So he can be the perfect serf.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.850
It would be part of his
servitude to clean his house,

28:48.430 --> 28:53.730
help abduct girls, bury the
bodies, get supplies, plant the roses.

28:54.020 --> 28:57.100
He had to buy roses, and a lot of them.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.730
Someone must have seen him.

28:58.740 --> 29:00.650
Let's get to the nurseries.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.260
We're looking for a man in his twenties.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.150
He keeps to himself.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.830
Avoids eye contact. Speaks very little,

29:09.840 --> 29:13.360
but when he does, he would
sound meek, almost feminine.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.990
He'd have purchased
soil, gardening tools...

29:17.000 --> 29:19.010
buys quite a few rose plants.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.880
Yeah,I know who you're
talking about. Henry.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.810
He's not a customer.

29:23.820 --> 29:26.230
Henry frost. Here.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.220
- He works here.
- Great.

29:29.230 --> 29:30.900
I need an address.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.290
He's destroyed everything he owns.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.060
He has no identity.

29:58.070 --> 30:00.010
He burned his face off his pictures.

30:00.020 --> 30:00.860
Why?

30:00.870 --> 30:04.090
A submissive depends upon a dominant
partner not only for instruction,

30:04.100 --> 30:06.470
but for purpose and meaning.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.670
So he's starting
over, wiping the slate clean.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.100
Yeah, but as what?

30:23.690 --> 30:25.030
Sorry.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.190
Did I scare you?

30:26.200 --> 30:27.340
No, it’s ok.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.900
- Let me help you with that.
- No, thanks. I got it.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.440
- Oh,god!
- Get in the trunk.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.600
- No!
- Get in the trunk!

30:54.610 --> 30:56.130
- God,please,no!
- Shut up!

30:56.140 --> 30:58.090
Shut up! Shut up!

30:58.100 --> 30:58.890
Get in the trunk!

30:58.900 --> 31:01.340
- Take the car - -
don't tell me what to do!

31:05.550 --> 31:07.790
Help me, somebody!

31:07.800 --> 31:09.520
- Please!
- Shut up!

31:10.360 --> 31:11.850
Help!

31:12.770 --> 31:13.890
Hey!

31:14.950 --> 31:18.370
Son of... Stop the car or I'll shoot!

31:19.930 --> 31:21.360
Damn it.

31:22.930 --> 31:24.660
I could have taken the shot.

31:24.670 --> 31:26.000
I was just afraid of hitting her.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.330
You get a good look at him?

31:27.340 --> 31:28.390
Yeah,he came in.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.730
Big ass bandage on the
left side of his face.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.230
Bought a beer and pumpkin seeds,

31:32.240 --> 31:33.760
went back to his truck and sat there.

31:33.770 --> 31:35.190
Was that his truck?

31:35.200 --> 31:36.010
Yes, sir.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.380
That was their M.O.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.020
Frost chauffeured Goehring around.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.170
Goehring picks a
victim, abducts her on foot,

31:41.180 --> 31:43.050
they drive off in separate vehicles.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.870
But this time, frost
had to play both roles,

31:44.880 --> 31:47.430
and he got sloppy, and he
left a witness and his car.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.740
Can you confirm that
that's the guy you saw?

31:51.850 --> 31:53.640
No.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.720
That's him.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.310
He looks like Goehring.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.990
Or frost's version of him.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.630
Ok,you're Goehring.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.490
Sadistic bastard.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.760
I'm frost, a submissive,troubled,gay man.

32:12.770 --> 32:14.000
I need you to dominate me

32:14.010 --> 32:16.920
because it gives me direction
and a purpose in life.

32:16.930 --> 32:17.690
And life is good.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.050
And then one day, I pull
the pin on a grenade.

32:20.060 --> 32:21.430
You die.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.240
And when I lose you, I
begin to lose my identity

32:24.250 --> 32:26.820
because my sense of
self was tied to you.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.770
You're showing classic signs
of depersonalization disorder

32:29.780 --> 32:32.000
precipitated by the stressor
of losing a loved one.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.560
Now, all that's left is me.

32:33.570 --> 32:36.070
- And you hate yourself.
- I do. Why?

32:36.080 --> 32:38.090
Because I brainwashed
you with all my rules.

32:38.100 --> 32:41.620
I've told you over and over how weak
you are how you're nothing without me.

32:41.630 --> 32:42.350
Right.

32:42.360 --> 32:46.170
So I go back to my home and annihilate
everything I own, every reminder of who I am.

32:46.180 --> 32:48.180
I erase myself and become you.

32:48.190 --> 32:50.020
It's the only way that you can survive.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.870
The only way that you can hold onto me.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.220
Frost transforms himself into Goehring

32:54.230 --> 32:56.140
and goes back to abducting women

32:56.340 --> 32:58.570
because that's what Goehring would do.

32:58.580 --> 33:00.050
We need to stop thinking like frost
and start thinking like Goehring.

33:01.030 --> 33:02.940
'Cause he's still calling the shots.

33:04.340 --> 33:07.250
Help me, somebody!

33:13.240 --> 33:15.080
help!

33:19.260 --> 33:20.990
Let me out

33:21.450 --> 33:25.410
What kind of man follows
another man around like a dog?

33:25.680 --> 33:28.330
If you act like a nobody...

33:29.020 --> 33:31.580
you'll be treated like a nobody.

33:31.590 --> 33:32.570
I'm not a nobody.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.820
- I'm you.
- Help!

33:52.600 --> 33:53.660
Hurry up.

33:53.670 --> 33:54.570
Hurry up! Come on!

33:54.580 --> 33:56.420
Ok,ok!

33:57.820 --> 33:59.350
Get over here.

34:01.390 --> 34:02.900
Get down.

34:04.410 --> 34:05.530
Please

34:05.950 --> 34:08.060
Sheriff, he’s taken
on Goehring’s persona.

34:08.070 --> 34:10.000
We have to assume he's
going to behave the same way.

34:10.010 --> 34:12.330
He's heavily armed, and
he's committed to his cause.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.889
If he's caught, he’s
not only willing to die,

34:13.900 --> 34:15.980
but to take as many of
us with him as possible.

34:15.989 --> 34:19.210
He's got a hostage, which means I'm going
to need the best sharp shooter you've got.

34:19.219 --> 34:19.850
That's fine.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.520
But we don't even know
where this guy's headed.

34:21.530 --> 34:24.040
The team's been working the profile, and
we think we've got something.

34:24.050 --> 34:27.650
In the tapes, Goehring makes
several mentions of "ideal land. "

34:27.659 --> 34:28.429
He also said that

34:28.440 --> 34:32.800
"lords live on higher ground to better
surveil the land and spot invaders. "

34:32.810 --> 34:34.290
He studied medieval defense strategies,

34:34.300 --> 34:36.590
so he'll probably go to a place
where he can protect himself.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.070
High ground, easily defendable.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.600
This picture was on Goehring’s fridge.

34:42.610 --> 34:44.550
Do you know where that is?

34:44.560 --> 34:46.050
That's black eagle peak.

34:46.060 --> 34:49.760
Militia groups used to use it for training
drills till the state stopped them.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.659
Ideal land.

34:58.050 --> 34:59.790
Please, don’t do this.

34:59.800 --> 35:00.890
Why?

35:01.520 --> 35:02.620
This is what I do.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.440
- My name is Becky-
- yeah. You shut up!

35:06.200 --> 35:07.600
Shut up!

35:07.610 --> 35:10.310
You don't have a name, not
until I give you one.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.630
You hear me?

35:24.180 --> 35:25.610
I teach school.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.930
I have a fiancé.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.130
What happened to your face?

35:34.140 --> 35:35.890
It looks bad.

35:36.770 --> 35:38.660
What's your name?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.230
What's my name?

35:40.830 --> 35:43.170
My name is Francis Goehring.

35:45.150 --> 35:46.640
You hear?!

35:53.550 --> 35:54.610
My guy's got eyes on him.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.280
He's on the very top of the peak
on the far side of that ridge.

35:57.290 --> 35:58.350
He'll see us coming.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.520
He already knows if he's
using that police scanner.

36:00.530 --> 36:01.970
We got to find a way to get up there.

36:01.980 --> 36:03.580
We'll never be able to get close enough.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.070
How it going with the sharp shooter?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.350
Who's that?

36:06.810 --> 36:07.930
Oh,you can't be serious.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.030
You asked for the best. He's it.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.440
Ex-special forces sniper.

36:11.450 --> 36:13.050
- He's a Civilian.
- He's Militia.

36:13.060 --> 36:14.780
I deputized him.

36:14.790 --> 36:16.960
He knows the terrain like nobody else.

36:16.970 --> 36:20.220
Wind in this valley will change
the trajectory of a shot by inches.

36:20.230 --> 36:23.310
If you can't read the wind, the
wrong person might get shot.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.180
I guess I don't need to
remind you gentleman of that.

36:26.190 --> 36:27.510
We can handle this.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.230
Good luck with that.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.470
Hey,it might not come down
to it if we don't get moving.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.700
I'll go with him.

36:31.710 --> 36:33.620
You want to flank around the
west side of the mountain?

36:33.630 --> 36:36.170
If he's on the north, I’ll get a
better view from the east ridge.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.390
It's steeper, higher ground.
Get a clear shot from there.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.790
- If you see the shot, call it.
- Good.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.040
Channel 23. Keep it open.

36:42.050 --> 36:42.900
I'll go with the sheriff.

36:42.910 --> 36:44.890
We'll stay at the base
and try to distract him.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.850
You go up to the northeast
and through the middle.

36:46.860 --> 36:48.750
Keep your head down.

37:06.150 --> 37:07.700
Francis Goehring?

37:07.710 --> 37:09.270
Channel 2!

37:10.930 --> 37:11.810
All we want to do is talk to you.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.700
Let me know if you can hear me.

37:13.710 --> 37:16.160
Yeah,I can hear you.

37:16.370 --> 37:18.060
Get up

37:19.580 --> 37:21.340
This is my land.

37:21.770 --> 37:24.020
You understand? Not yours.

37:24.030 --> 37:27.900
And you will leave it, or she dies.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.560
She's tucked in real tight.

37:34.780 --> 37:36.270
Too tight. I can't get the shot.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.090
You got to get him to move.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.680
No shot. We got to distract frost.

37:40.690 --> 37:41.980
Get him away from Becky.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.930
How are we going to do that?

37:45.050 --> 37:46.240
He's not Goehring.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.320
He can't do this.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.940
He shot Angela miller in the back.

37:50.190 --> 37:52.170
All I want to do is talk!

37:52.180 --> 37:54.640
You want to talk? You go ahead and talk.

37:54.650 --> 37:58.400
But you come any closer, and
she gets a bullet. You hear me?

37:59.700 --> 38:02.150
She's going to be the
first to go. I swear!

38:03.020 --> 38:06.230
Your policy was shoot to
kill at ruby ridge, wasn’t it?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.720
It wasn’t, but it is now.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.140
Yeah.

38:12.030 --> 38:13.630
Well, I’m not in the bureau, am I?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.450
We know a lot about you, Henry.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.900
We know your name is Henry frost.

38:16.910 --> 38:18.280
We know you're
25-years-old.

38:18.290 --> 38:21.820
We know that your dad kicked you
out of the house when you were 15.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.430
He was a drunk and he
abused and he abandoned you.

38:24.440 --> 38:28.060
And ever since, your life has been
a series of jails and institutions,

38:28.070 --> 38:30.130
- and it's been hell.
- Shut up!

38:30.620 --> 38:31.800
No!

38:32.900 --> 38:36.150
Never let the bastards take you alive.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.980
Never be forgotten.

38:37.990 --> 38:41.450
You the man who sent
those 2 agents into my bar?

38:41.460 --> 38:42.500
I was.

38:42.510 --> 38:44.370
To piss me off.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.640
If you have the shot, take it.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.690
Innocent woman died at ruby ridge.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.240
As tragic as that outcome was,

38:51.250 --> 38:54.270
my order on that day is
the same as it is now.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.410
This man is not going to be taken alive.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.560
You were there?

38:59.570 --> 39:00.900
I was.

39:00.910 --> 39:02.890
The shot's the signal to go.

39:04.020 --> 39:05.580
Take the damn shot.

39:05.590 --> 39:07.650
Maybe your partner
will talk him out of it.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.580
Henry, just let the girl go.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.170
And I'll clear everybody out,

39:11.180 --> 39:12.860
and you and I can just talk.

39:12.870 --> 39:13.930
That's a promise.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.990
- It doesn't have to end like this.
- Yes, it does!

39:16.000 --> 39:17.480
Yes, it does!

39:17.490 --> 39:18.250
And it will!

39:18.260 --> 39:19.150
Henry, let her go.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.940
Henry, let her go!

39:37.090 --> 39:39.820
Ok,ok,it's ok.

39:40.190 --> 39:42.060
I'm gonna get this off you.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.070
He's gone.

39:46.930 --> 39:48.090
Let me help you up.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.910
- Is there anything else on you?
- No.

40:16.010 --> 40:17.790
It's quite a view.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.470
Reminds me of Idaho.

40:24.110 --> 40:25.510
Me, too.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.640
All anybody remembers is that

40:30.650 --> 40:35.650
an FBI sniper killed a mother
while she was holding her baby.

40:37.820 --> 40:40.060
6 months later. Waco.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.000
80 men, women and children died.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.100
Not a single shot did we fire that day.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.840
The legacy of those
failures still haunts us.

40:50.850 --> 40:53.280
It's why some people don't trust us.

40:53.750 --> 40:57.830
Made me start thinking
about leaving the agency.

40:59.670 --> 41:02.640
So what started you
thinking about coming back?

41:03.500 --> 41:05.610
Unfinished business.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.640
You know, there’s one thing
you'll learn about me, Rossi.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.270
I'm relentless.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.340
I'll find out.

41:19.305 --> 41:25.489
