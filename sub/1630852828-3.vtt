WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:10.920
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:12.040 --> 00:13.880
I'm Clara, I'm 32,

00:13.960 --> 00:17.280
I come from Portela de Sacavém
and I'm looking for love.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.400
I don't care if it's a man or a woman.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.480
It doesn't matter.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.600
I fall in love for the person.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.520
<i>Clara is very proud of being different.</i>

00:36.600 --> 00:40.000
That makes her, of course,
an Enneagram type 4,

00:40.080 --> 00:43.120
being very individualistic.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.600
But deep down, Clara is romantic.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.680
So, she lives in this dichotomy,
in this contradiction.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.000
Each person has in them four vital values.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.520
I was very surprised…

00:57.600 --> 00:58.840
NEURO LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING SPECIALIST

00:58.920 --> 01:00.640
…with Clara's choices.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.760
CLARA LOOKS FOR THE PERFECT LOVE

01:04.840 --> 01:06.440
Love. No doubt.

01:06.520 --> 01:07.960
LOVE

01:10.440 --> 01:13.000
Without honesty, everything is a lie.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.600
You've been hurt, lied to.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.120
But whoever makes me laugh
conquers half of me, straightaway.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.240
SENSE OF HUMOR

01:30.320 --> 01:33.040
And how do they conquer the other half?

01:34.440 --> 01:35.680
That, now…

01:42.640 --> 01:45.280
A relationship is based fundamentally
on four pillars.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.680
PSYCHOLOGIST AND SEX THERAPIST

01:46.760 --> 01:48.800
Four pillars that are fundamental.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.240
To act.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.000
To motivate.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.480
When I say "motivate," it's motivate.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.800
To accept.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.200
And to respect, of course.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.080
<i>Deep down,</i>
<i>I try to manage the expectations</i>

02:02.160 --> 02:04.200
each one has of their ideal couple.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.680
<i>Clara has filled</i>
<i>a lot of questionnaires that helped</i>

02:10.480 --> 02:15.960
to find out what her ideal
perfect love is.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.800
<i>Then, I tried to discover</i>
<i>what her partner should look like.</i>

02:24.320 --> 02:26.080
<i>I only ask for one thing.</i>

02:26.160 --> 02:27.920
Don't be ugly!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.120
My partner won't be, right?

02:33.960 --> 02:38.600
My specialty is evaluation and diagnosis.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.240
Science should be at love's disposal.
That's why I'm here.

02:45.280 --> 02:51.640
In this matching phase,
it's important to evaluate profiles.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.080
The temperament,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.760
the behavioral standards,

02:56.440 --> 03:00.720
<i>to know how she's going to react</i>
<i>to this process,</i>

03:00.800 --> 03:04.600
<i>to foresee not only</i>
<i>the participant's response…</i>

03:04.680 --> 03:05.640
CLARA IS TESTED

03:05.720 --> 03:08.280
<i>…but also</i>
<i>the participant's brain response.</i>

03:08.360 --> 03:12.960
<i>This is like</i>
<i>a psychophysiological monitoring.</i>

03:13.040 --> 03:17.640
This allows us to know that Clara is,

03:17.720 --> 03:22.080
emotionally, a Ferrari 488.

03:22.160 --> 03:27.800
<i>That means she's going</i>
<i>from 0 to 100 in 2.026 seconds.</i>

03:27.880 --> 03:31.600
Two seconds and 26 milliseconds.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.720
<i>More or less.</i>

03:34.800 --> 03:37.640
But that's why we're here.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
To show her the way.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.520
Aren't you feeling it?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.280
Take a look at this pic.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.240
<i>Clara is, as you know, a beautiful woman.</i>

03:47.320 --> 03:51.520
Any of the competitors
will be happy to have her as a bride,

03:51.600 --> 03:52.920
as a woman.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.880
According to each love match,
there are two possibilities.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.480
Which one will it be?

03:59.560 --> 04:00.440
<i>That's right.</i>

04:00.520 --> 04:05.000
Clara and Vítor B
have a compatibility of 84%.

04:05.080 --> 04:11.560
He works in his parent's restaurant
but wants to be a truck driver.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.960
And he's a Buddhist.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.000
To find love now…

04:16.080 --> 04:17.120
VÍTOR B.
37 YEARS OLD

04:17.200 --> 04:19.040
I think I did a bit of everything.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.000
I've tried every way.

04:22.080 --> 04:24.040
Acquaintances,

04:25.400 --> 04:28.000
friends of acquaintances,

04:29.120 --> 04:31.440
acquaintances from social media,

04:32.320 --> 04:38.480
friends of friends
that were only social media friends.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.880
And we have Sara.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.960
Clara has a compatibility of 91% with her.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.400
I've applied because…

04:45.480 --> 04:46.440
SARA
30 YEARS OLD

04:46.520 --> 04:47.600
…I believe in love.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.400
I want to start a new life.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.000
Certainly, the therapists' choices
will be more accurate than mine.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.800
WHO WILL BE CHOSEN?

05:08.280 --> 05:10.200
Now… Who?

05:12.160 --> 05:13.320
Who will be chosen?

05:13.400 --> 05:18.400
That's what we'll find out, up next,
on <i>Love Your Neighbor.</i>

05:18.480 --> 05:22.160
LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR

06:12.920 --> 06:16.800
So that means
you still don't know who you're marrying?

06:18.960 --> 06:20.880
That's not very…

06:23.080 --> 06:24.240
conventional.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.560
No, it's not.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.960
CLARA FERREIRA + ??
ONLY CHILD, FIANCÉ UNKNOWN

06:36.640 --> 06:38.320
I'm sorry, how old are you?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
Twenty-five.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.120
You're not a girl anymore.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.320
But not yet a woman.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.560
Those are the lyrics
to a Christina Aguilera song, right?

06:51.280 --> 06:55.280
Girls, the producers
are asking for more action.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.120
This is a preparation for a wedding,
not a funeral. Okay?

06:59.840 --> 07:01.920
And it's not a Christina Aguilera song.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.960
It's a Britney Spears song.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.480
So, let's go again?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.720
-I'm looking forward to meeting the groom!
-Wait.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.200
Just a second.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.080
Okay.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.680
-Now?
-Now, yes, go.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.160
I can barely wait to meet the groom.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.640
I have an incredible feeling!

07:33.720 --> 07:37.200
I feel ready
for this new phase in my life.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.280
Abrantes,

08:07.800 --> 08:09.280
Adémia,

08:10.120 --> 08:11.600
Afife,

08:12.600 --> 08:14.440
Agualva-Cacém.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.920
-Good morning.
-Aguda, Aguim.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.440
Albergaria dos Velhos,

08:21.280 --> 08:23.560
Albufeira-Ferreiras, Alcaide…

08:23.640 --> 08:26.840
Train stations. Alphabetical order.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.760
Still on the letter A?

08:30.280 --> 08:32.200
She just started, before you came in.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.120
Alcântara-Terra.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.040
Did I make her think of trains?

08:37.400 --> 08:38.960
Maybe you did.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.600
You're always late
and you slightly smell like sweat.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.360
Maybe it was that, Dad.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.520
Alhandra…

08:46.600 --> 08:47.560
Really?

08:51.320 --> 08:54.440
-The reality show guys are already here?
-Alpedrinha.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.800
Since early morning.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.080
-Alvega-Ortiga.
-What is the show called?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.320
<i>-Love Your Neighbor?</i>
-Alverca.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.840
<i>Love Your Neighbor?</i>

09:06.640 --> 09:08.440
Like, "I don't love that person,

09:08.520 --> 09:11.360
I'm going to love my neighbor
that has more tattoos"?

09:11.440 --> 09:12.880
Areia Darque, Arentim…

09:12.960 --> 09:15.320
No, I think that
it's more of a religious thing

09:15.400 --> 09:17.960
like, "Loving thy neighbor as thyself."

09:18.040 --> 09:19.720
The things Jesus said.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.040
I think that's it.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.720
You should start making your own coffee.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.000
…and Avanca.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.120
And Avanca?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.840
You do know, don't you?

09:34.920 --> 09:38.760
I was kidnapped in 1968

09:39.640 --> 09:41.280
in Avanca.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.240
If it wasn't for Joaquim

09:44.320 --> 09:46.920
who got $1 million, I wouldn't be here…

09:47.680 --> 09:48.600
Look…

09:48.680 --> 09:51.760
I would still be there,
in the hands of those criminals.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.600
No. Sorry.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.160
It wasn't like that.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.600
That's nonsense.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.200
It wasn't…

10:04.480 --> 10:07.560
This happened,
but it was in Entroncamento.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.600
Talking about crossroads,
where is your mother?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.320
Baixa da Banheira…

10:14.520 --> 10:16.320
Was that a pun?

10:17.400 --> 10:20.920
Yes, "entroncamento" is
when two roads crisscross.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.120
That's what Mom wants to do.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.920
Get out of your life
and find her own. Great!

10:27.800 --> 10:32.160
You have to stop explaining
all the issues to exhaustion, son.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.480
Or else you will die a virgin.

10:39.080 --> 10:44.080
THE LANDLORD PREFERS THE THIGH
BUT IT'S NEGOTIABLE

10:44.160 --> 10:48.560
The last owner had twins,
so they moved to Estoril.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.280
He also wanted to open a cake shop.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.600
As you see,
it will need some work, of course.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.560
Make yourselves comfortable.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.200
But let's be honest.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.760
You can even paint the walls gold

11:14.840 --> 11:19.200
or hang a Paula Rego in the bathroom,
over by the toilet, but that…

11:19.280 --> 11:22.840
That doesn't mean
the apartment has more cachet.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.240
This is a dump.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.200
It will always be a dump.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.040
And how much are they asking?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.960
To rent, it's a reasonable price.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.160
A limb. Of your choice.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.600
Arm or leg. Lower limb or upper limb,
it doesn't matter.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.200
They also ask for
three front teeth as a deposit.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.480
Half a kilogram of meat
that you'll have to cut from your body.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.200
The landlord prefers the thigh.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.240
But it's negotiable, of course.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.800
I didn't know it was so expensive.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.720
How long has it been
since you last looked for a house?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.240
Things have changed a lot.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.360
What if I want to buy?

12:04.440 --> 12:06.000
Then…

12:06.080 --> 12:10.400
In that case, they're asking you
to sacrifice your first-born.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.440
I know.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.400
It's a hard initial investment.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.360
But I can assure you that
in the long run, it will pay off.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.640
Are you very attached
to your first-born? Do you love her?

12:23.720 --> 12:26.080
Yes. I like Rita a lot. Yes, a lot.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.240
Wait!

12:27.720 --> 12:31.560
I'll show you something
that might help you decide.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.400
This is a storage space.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.080
It's always useful.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.440
To hide stuff we don't want people to see.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.200
To put it out of sight…

12:42.280 --> 12:47.240
Your fear of ending up all alone
might as well be kept here.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.800
Or that feeling that,
after ruining your family,

12:51.880 --> 12:55.680
you'll never have an orgasm again.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.160
It's panic. The panic.

12:57.240 --> 13:02.320
The panic of being naked in front of
someone that has never seen you naked.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.760
For the first time in 30 years.
It's the perfect place to keep all that.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.160
You close the door and…

13:11.080 --> 13:12.280
Pretend it doesn't exist.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.640
This place wouldn't even suit
a Bulgarian student.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.120
-My mother was Bulgarian.
-I can tell.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.240
You trying to insult me?

13:18.320 --> 13:21.600
What do you have against Bulgarians
that would make you take that an insult?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.240
You said that this place
wouldn't even suit a Bulgarian student.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.600
I said that because
what's the minimum wage there, Є500?

13:28.680 --> 13:31.320
In fact, I've been to Pleven.
And I love it.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.760
-My mother is from Pleven!
-Good!

13:37.720 --> 13:39.040
What do you think?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.920
This is not what I'm looking for.
Thank you.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.720
This is not it.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.520
With the budget you've mentioned,
it'll be hard to find anything better.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.040
I'm really sorry.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.880
Vanessa, wait!

14:03.240 --> 14:04.400
Impossible!

14:05.320 --> 14:06.280
No!

14:07.080 --> 14:09.280
Vanessa, I have something to tell you.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.160
In fact, I should've told you before,

14:12.240 --> 14:15.040
but then you announced
your separation and I--

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
They're joking!

14:16.200 --> 14:19.080
I'm with you and it seems that
you're somewhere else, right?

14:19.840 --> 14:21.440
Hello? Are you here now?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.080
I'm getting married.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.280
Again.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.280
You don't know him.
I don't know him that well.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.160
We started dating three months ago,
but it's been so nice. He's great!

14:33.240 --> 14:35.080
All of a sudden, he asked.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.800
On his knees and everything,
what was I supposed to do? Say no?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.640
It's Francisco.
Friend of a friend. He's an engineer.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.040
He went to university with the
ex prime-minister, Sócrates.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.120
But don't think badly of him!

14:46.200 --> 14:47.800
They weren't even close.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.240
He votes for the Green Party.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.520
He's so cute.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.560
-That cute?
-Really cute.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.800
-I have to go, I'm really late.
-Give me another ride.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.680
Lardosa. Lavradio.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.280
Because no one knows
who she's getting married to,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.640
the guests are the bride's
so they won't spoil the surprise.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.840
How is that?

15:15.920 --> 15:18.040
There are two choices.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.400
Vítor B. and Sara M.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.440
A man and a woman?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.960
They'll only make the final revelation
at the end.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.560
It's like this now.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.320
-What?
-It's like this!

15:29.360 --> 15:33.120
Marriage used to be sacred
and now it's a depressing show.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.760
It's like watching Uncle Alberto
trying to dance when he's wasted.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.280
At first you might laugh,
but then it's just sad.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.360
Back in your day, for example,
it was a serious commitment, right?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.320
Right there, written in stone.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.080
Don't talk about us.

15:48.160 --> 15:53.240
You're frustrated because
Vanessa told you to sleep on the sofa.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.400
You don't have to be so dramatic.
It's life!

15:56.480 --> 15:58.640
I think we should refuse.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.800
Refuse what?

15:59.880 --> 16:01.840
Refuse to participate in this circus!

16:02.280 --> 16:04.760
Either we take love seriously,
or we're just fooling around.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.320
I know. Don't say it. We need the money.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.160
-What is going on here, Dad?
-Nothing.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.400
It's what I said. Wounded pride.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.240
To wound a man's pride
in a mid-life crisis is worse than poking

16:18.320 --> 16:20.560
a wild animal trapped in a cage.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.400
Didn't you say that you didn't want
to be a part of this?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.040
Then don't be a part of this!

16:25.120 --> 16:28.040
-What mid-life crisis?
-Calm down. Sit.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.080
This is a good idea, right?

16:30.160 --> 16:34.520
Despite all the fireworks and cameras,
this is a simple thing to put together.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.000
It's a modest, small ceremony.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.040
They don't even
want to spend money on this.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.840
The marriage is the first episode,

16:40.920 --> 16:43.120
then they'll air the honeymoon,
going home…

16:43.200 --> 16:45.320
So why are we even making an effort?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.600
Because if it goes well,
we can be official partners of the show!

16:48.680 --> 16:51.240
-Of course.
-Are you aware of the publicity?

16:51.320 --> 16:53.680
-Loads of publicity.
-Loads?

16:53.760 --> 16:56.040
-Loads of publicity.
-Loads of publicity, Dad!

16:56.120 --> 16:57.720
Those are two "loads!"

16:57.800 --> 16:59.240
Sorry I'm late.

16:59.320 --> 17:03.600
Don't worry.
You're on time to hear the verdict.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.760
What verdict?

17:05.320 --> 17:07.120
Love is dead.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.320
We have to come up with a new word
for what we're allegedly celebrating.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.920
This one doesn't work anymore.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.560
It's outdated. It's dead!

17:15.640 --> 17:19.080
I suggest the word "Lovedeath."

17:19.160 --> 17:20.800
"Love" with "death" at the end.

17:21.360 --> 17:22.840
Love, death.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.040
It makes sense, doesn't it?

17:25.120 --> 17:27.240
-The "lovedeath" of my life.
-About that.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.520
Natália is getting married again,
to Francisco.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.240
Did you two know anything about this?

17:35.320 --> 17:39.000
She asked us not to tell you.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.040
She wanted to be the one
to give you the big news.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.120
Your sister gets married like clockwork.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.000
Every seven years…

17:49.080 --> 17:52.000
Here we go again with a wedding.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.680
It's good that I don't have to cook.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.920
Who's Francisco?

17:59.560 --> 18:03.040
Someone who went to university
with Sócrates.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.920
But he votes for the Green Party.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.000
She invited us both
to her bachelorette party.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.400
-Bachelorette?
-Tonight.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.600
Shouldn't it be a "divorce party"?

18:12.680 --> 18:13.880
Must be great…

18:15.040 --> 18:16.880
to live with no regrets.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
Dad?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.280
Are you having a stroke?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.080
You're having a stroke.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.840
You need to be patient with your dad.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.560
You have to excuse him.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.360
-A lot of patience.
-I know, Mom. Don't worry.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.840
I have it all covered.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.360
Few years ago,
there was a study indicating

19:07.440 --> 19:10.280
that half of divorcees
regretted their decision.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.240
And 42% of them

19:12.320 --> 19:15.760
even came to the conclusion that
they should give marriage another chance.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.560
Is it me or did you say the opposite
to me a few days ago?

19:19.640 --> 19:21.960
Most people feel better after the divorce?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.280
But that study
is also part of a marketing campaign

19:25.360 --> 19:27.760
for the DVD release of <i>The Love Punch.</i>

19:27.840 --> 19:29.240
-Have you seen it?
-No.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.240
It's a pretty weak romantic comedy
from 2013.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.760
-Nothing much.
-Okay.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.080
There's Pierce Brosnan
and Emma Thompson in it.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.640
I didn't see it and I didn't like it.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.600
It's not that realistic, so forget it.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.920
Although it does touch on one point
that I wanted to make to you.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.920
No decision is irreversible.
We can always change our minds.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.440
Is it hurting a lot?

19:58.640 --> 19:59.760
Let me check that out.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.480
Show me. Where does it hurt?
Here or under there?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.440
From here to the tips of my fingers.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.120
-It's all hurting?
-All of it.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
So, come on.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.400
-Let's do one thing.
-Yes.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.560
You'll lift your arm,
but you have to take a deep breath,

20:13.640 --> 20:15.440
a really deep breath, go.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.760
Exactly.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.680
Go.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.480
More. Keep breathing, go on! That's it!

20:22.240 --> 20:26.160
You're a mix between
an autistic person and a Shaolin monk.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.920
I don't know how we made you.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.480
Maybe we didn't,
maybe you were swapped at the hospital.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.360
You should be careful with what you say.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.520
Because I'm your son
and that can cause trauma.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.440
Okay?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.760
That is the problem.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.120
All the things we say

20:43.200 --> 20:45.680
and all the things we do
leave a mark on someone.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.280
The worst
is not leaving a mark on someone.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.560
ALL THAT SPARKS WILL BURN OUT IN THE END

20:59.640 --> 21:00.920
<i>Do you know what I do?</i>

21:01.680 --> 21:04.840
I fry the meat,
put some wheat flour on top,

21:05.680 --> 21:08.360
add the broth and it'll make it thicker.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.280
Damn! I haven't thought about that.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.800
I learned that from my mother.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.920
Do you know that's Tatiana's problem?

21:18.000 --> 21:18.920
How come?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Her parents were never very present.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.040
So that foundation is missing.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.520
Bottom line, the sucker here gets screwed.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.640
If I get home and I don't cook,
what do I eat?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.040
Scrambled eggs and rice.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.680
-You know?
-Yeah, I know.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.040
You know, foundations are everything.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.200
Good night.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.080
When you don't have a good foundation,
the floor shakes.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.080
But you can be a good foundation for her.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.560
You'll be responsible
for stopping her floor from shaking.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.560
It's over!

21:46.080 --> 21:47.120
I've said it.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.640
This is not good today, man.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.840
I'm wondering if it's worth
having a photographer here.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.680
Any guy can come here
with a camera in his pocket.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.040
What are you talking about?

22:03.120 --> 22:04.560
Are you firing me today?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.720
Jorge, don't do that today, man.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Not today.

22:07.880 --> 22:08.720
Daniel!

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
You're a toll guy in a world
where all tolls are automated.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.920
You're powerless
in the face of advancing technology, man.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.160
Toll guy? What the hell is that, man?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.280
Do you think that helps?

22:22.360 --> 22:24.120
Calm down! Dude, calm down.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.640
So? Look…

22:25.720 --> 22:28.560
It's okay. You look terrible.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.440
You look terrible.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.880
Do you know what you need? A drink.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.640
That's what you need.
I'll get you a drink. It's on the house.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.280
You came!

22:57.640 --> 22:59.920
You could have told me a bit earlier!

23:00.000 --> 23:01.960
It was funnier that way!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.800
Joana, Joana, Rita.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.640
Sister.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.720
I'm so glad you came!

23:09.800 --> 23:13.000
-I want to get married on your farm.
-Really?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.200
When will that be?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.920
As soon as possible,
before one of us changes our minds.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.600
-Love it! Come dance!
-No.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.640
Good night.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.960
A glass of red wine, please.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.160
Another one.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.600
One thing is for sure about being alive.

26:34.160 --> 26:38.640
Even the darkest of nights
hides a promise of a better day.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.400
What a beautiful thing you've just said.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.120
-Yes that's…
-That's the most…

26:49.360 --> 26:50.280
I gotta go.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.760
Are you okay to drive?

26:55.520 --> 26:56.440
Yes.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.040
Do you want a ride?

27:01.400 --> 27:02.960
Give me your cell phone.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.040
-Unlock it, please!
-Okay.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.800
We're separated.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.880
Really. I swear.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.920
Let me process this.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.440
Let me try to understand
whether you're lying or not.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.400
I have three kids.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.720
One of them lives in Istanbul,
can you believe?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.160
Call me.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.320
When you're done.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.800
-When I'm done what?
-Separating.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.880
Clarinha really deserves happiness.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.200
There's a funny story
I can tell you about her. Once…

28:50.280 --> 28:51.640
KIKO - 30 YEARS OLD
BEST MAN

28:51.960 --> 28:53.720
…we were going to the beach.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.560
There were two paths to get there.

28:56.640 --> 29:00.600
One was all cleaned, marked, clay floor.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.960
The other was through the trees,
in the middle of the woods.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.880
We all wanted
to go through the "regular path."

29:08.520 --> 29:10.720
But Clarinha right away said, "No!"

29:10.800 --> 29:12.840
"I'm going for the fastest one!"

29:12.920 --> 29:14.040
2500 EUROS IN THE MAGIC DOSSIER GAME

29:14.120 --> 29:15.040
Clarinha…

29:16.960 --> 29:21.680
Of course she got there first, right,
with her feet full of shit and…

29:21.760 --> 29:23.000
Can I say "shit"?

29:24.160 --> 29:25.120
Okay, sorry.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.600
With her feet full of shit
and her legs all scratched…

29:28.680 --> 29:29.520
CALL AND WIN FOR REAL

29:29.600 --> 29:31.800
She went straight to the ocean, dived in.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.840
It burned like hell
because of the scratches on her legs.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.960
Poor girl, her legs were all red.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.160
For a week she couldn't put jeans on.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.160
Clarinha…

29:47.880 --> 29:50.160
But that's it, she got there first.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.640
Do you get it?

29:52.200 --> 29:53.080
Do you know why?

29:53.160 --> 29:55.920
LOVE JACKPOT
1020 EUROS TODAY'S GAME

29:56.000 --> 29:57.760
Because Clarinha didn't fear

29:58.960 --> 30:01.640
choosing the path
that no one else wanted to choose.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.920
Do you get it? The metaphor?

30:08.320 --> 30:12.160
You deserve to be very happy, Clarinha.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.720
Very, very happy.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.520
Hey. Hey.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.960
Wake up, man. Let's go.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.120
Is Vanessa okay?

30:42.200 --> 30:45.120
I know what will make you well. Let's go.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.160
Joaquim!

30:49.440 --> 30:50.440
Joaquim!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.120
Joaquim!

31:01.560 --> 31:04.080
Joaquim, what's going on?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.360
Put your hands like this.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.480
Okay.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.960
Show me your hands.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.760
Not like that!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.160
Where did you learn that?

31:41.720 --> 31:45.320
I was known as the Tiger of Raia.

31:47.040 --> 31:52.080
Ages ago, I would go to Spain to fight,

31:52.800 --> 31:54.040
quite often.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.960
I won more than I lost.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.360
Go on. Push!

32:14.360 --> 32:17.680
Everyone needs an escape.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.920
A valve.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.240
To…

32:25.320 --> 32:31.400
release the air
when pressure seems too much.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.960
Name the train stations
in alphabetical order.

32:45.080 --> 32:51.040
If you start punching like crazy,
you'll be tired in seconds.

32:52.200 --> 32:57.640
You raise it little by little,
the intensity and the pace.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.240
And you go around the bag.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.560
It helps you focus.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.920
My arm is feeling weird here--

33:08.000 --> 33:09.960
-Come on, man--
-Dad!

33:12.680 --> 33:14.960
Since when do you get up early
to exercise?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.200
Grandpa, where's Grandma?

33:18.040 --> 33:20.880
It's all set in the kitchen,
but I don't know where she is.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.520
I still don't know
where he got the money from.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.040
I asked him several times,
but he never wanted to tell me.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.840
If you think about it,

33:33.320 --> 33:36.720
you can imagine how much work it takes
to save so many escudos!

33:39.920 --> 33:43.800
You know that
we used to have escudos, right?

33:46.760 --> 33:50.720
So imagine the work it took
to save so many escudos,

33:50.800 --> 33:54.480
so he could go to the bank afterwards
and exchange them for dollars!

33:56.280 --> 33:57.840
It wasn't like it is now.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.520
Things would take time in the olden days.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.360
Even days!

34:03.960 --> 34:06.600
Now nothing takes days.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.920
It takes less than a day
to go to the other side of the world.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.120
Sirtomé Mané.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.480
The name of my kidnappers.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.200
I will never forget
because one of them had bad breath.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.360
Thank you.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.560
Clarinha's first relationship.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.120
It was with Carlos.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.360
We'd call him SC.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.280
Short Circuit. It was always sparking!

35:36.360 --> 35:38.640
BEATING HEART
CALL AND WIN

35:38.720 --> 35:40.000
In the beginning,

35:40.080 --> 35:42.720
she wouldn't pay
too much attention to him.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.920
But he never gave up on her.
He stuck around.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.640
He swore he would win her over.

35:47.720 --> 35:52.120
And then, eventually,
he won her over, but…

35:53.320 --> 35:55.320
whatever that means, right?
"Win her."

35:55.880 --> 35:58.200
I always thought it was dangerous,
those people that

35:58.280 --> 36:01.600
see love as a declaration of war.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.360
"I will win you."

36:03.840 --> 36:05.480
You'll win me?

36:05.560 --> 36:07.160
Honey, take it easy!

36:07.240 --> 36:10.200
We're not in the 15th century, are we?
That was before!

36:10.280 --> 36:12.280
Back in the colonial times. Not now.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.240
Now we… I don't know,

36:14.320 --> 36:17.880
we're like a country, right?
Lots of people living here

36:17.960 --> 36:22.080
and, at the most, you get a tourist visa.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.880
EUROMILLIONS
THE WINNING NUMBERS

36:23.960 --> 36:28.160
If you're good enough,
you can stay here for a while. We'll see.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.280
Now, "to win"?

36:31.520 --> 36:35.800
Usually the other person, sooner or later,
ends up wanting to get rid of the winners.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.120
That's what I think.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.640
All that sparks ends up burning out,
sooner or later.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.280
I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.280
You will cut this shit later, right?

36:49.000 --> 36:52.840
That motorcycle is great! Is it from
around here or is it from the show?

36:53.680 --> 36:54.880
I'll be right back.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.440
What are they going to do? Draw lots?

37:01.440 --> 37:02.400
You're beautiful.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.560
Everything will be all right.

37:11.160 --> 37:14.400
THE BIG DAY HAS ARRIVED

37:31.880 --> 37:34.560
And the groom is…

37:35.800 --> 37:37.160
Vítor B.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.040
You're beautiful.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.960
Can you believe this?
It doesn't look real, does it?

37:57.040 --> 38:01.360
Dad. You should be photographing
the bride, not your wife. Okay?

38:04.920 --> 38:06.040
How's the arm?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.000
Better.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.920
Ready?

38:21.480 --> 38:22.880
Yes. I mean,

38:22.960 --> 38:26.520
I'm dying to smoke,
but I can wait until we're married.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
What?

38:31.440 --> 38:34.240
THE WEDDING GOES SOUTH

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
Vítor B!

38:36.320 --> 38:39.200
-Vítor!
-I told you this could happen.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.120
He's an Enneagram type 1.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.520
I'm not picky.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.560
I accept everyone.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.440
But not people who smoke.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.480
I have nothing against those people,

38:50.560 --> 38:53.600
but I don't want to share space
with someone like that.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.600
I don't!

38:56.840 --> 38:58.160
I think it's legit.

38:59.720 --> 39:00.920
Okay…

39:01.000 --> 39:03.120
I think it's good. Well done.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.280
Well done, Vítor B.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.640
Well, flaws, I have them, everyone does.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.600
For instance, cigarettes!

39:11.680 --> 39:12.760
CLARA 32
YEARS OLD

39:12.840 --> 39:15.440
I've tried to quit so many times,
I haven't succeed yet.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.720
Maybe now I will, who knows?

39:18.960 --> 39:20.280
Hello, new life!

39:20.800 --> 39:22.360
Goodbye, old habits!

39:29.680 --> 39:32.480
FROM DREAM TO NIGHTMARE IN SECONDS

39:35.840 --> 39:37.840
-What happened?
-Loads of publicity.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.600
Loads of publicity…

39:41.800 --> 39:43.880
Three, two, one.

39:45.240 --> 39:49.480
Have I withheld information
that ended up sabotaging this…

39:49.560 --> 39:50.520
Louder!

39:55.080 --> 39:57.880
Did I intentionally withhold information
and sabotage Clara's wedding,

39:57.960 --> 39:59.200
and therefore, the show?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.400
Yes. But I can explain why.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.680
Clara has filled a lot of questionnaires
that led us to find out

40:08.240 --> 40:11.320
what matters to her
regarding perfect love.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.280
And…

40:13.960 --> 40:15.080
That's me.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.520
We're 97% compatible.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.800
She needs to realize it.

40:21.320 --> 40:25.440
I've already tried to explain it to her,
but she's not very good at math.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.400
I know that she thinks I'm ugly.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.760
But I'm not so bad for my age.

40:34.000 --> 40:34.960
Am I?

40:38.880 --> 40:41.560
Oh, fuck!

41:00.880 --> 41:03.200
Have you paid the ransom to the criminals?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.960
Where do you get all that money

41:10.600 --> 41:13.520
to keep rescuing me, my love?

41:16.760 --> 41:18.920
I sell everything I have.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.480
Every time it's necessary.

41:22.960 --> 41:27.200
A million dollars is a cheap price
for one more day with you.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.680
Oh my love.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.040
Oh…
