But what is it with
old people today?

42:07.786 --> 42:09.396
Boring.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.093
Old?

42:11.137 --> 42:12.138
I'm not old.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.444
How old do you think I am?

42:15.402 --> 42:17.143
I don't know.

42:17.186 --> 42:18.100
Like 70.

42:21.147 --> 42:22.496
No, 57.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.323
Woo.

42:23.366 --> 42:24.585
[laughing]

42:24.629 --> 42:26.108
That's pretty old, Jozy.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.201
Anyway, I thought you didn't
care what people think.

42:42.081 --> 42:43.038
You must miss her.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.223
How did she die?

43:00.621 --> 43:01.448
Huntington's.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.627
It's a disease of
the nervous system.

43:06.671 --> 43:07.541
But then you'd know all
about that, wouldn't you?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.499
Being the doctor.

43:09.543 --> 43:10.718
Psychotherapist.

43:13.286 --> 43:14.113
Any kids?

43:18.813 --> 43:20.380
We were told that there
was a 50/50 chance

43:20.423 --> 43:22.208
that any children she had

43:23.426 --> 43:24.645
would inherit her condition,

43:24.689 --> 43:27.126
so she didn't think
it was worth the risk.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.698
It was the only thing
we ever argued about.

43:38.572 --> 43:40.095
My mom died when I was 12.

43:41.836 --> 43:43.142
[Joseph] I'm sorry about that.

43:43.185 --> 43:44.665
No, don't be.

43:44.709 --> 43:46.406
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

43:48.408 --> 43:49.714
You shouldn't talk like that.

43:51.193 --> 43:52.499
Hey.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.588
I'm a glass half
full type of girl.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.069
[chuckling]

43:57.112 --> 43:59.332
I mean like now, for instance.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.551
You say you don't like heights,

44:01.595 --> 44:03.031
but on the positive side,

44:03.075 --> 44:05.338
you're a 158 meters
closer to your wife.

44:05.381 --> 44:07.601
You could probably shout
and she'd hear you.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.434
Tanya!

44:15.565 --> 44:16.523
Hey, Tanya!

44:18.090 --> 44:19.047
What are you doing?

44:19.091 --> 44:20.701
What does it look like?

44:20.745 --> 44:23.573
Joseph wants to talk to you!

44:23.617 --> 44:25.750
Joseph's right here!

44:25.793 --> 44:27.273
[Joseph] Stop it!

44:27.316 --> 44:28.709
Can you tell him to
cheer up, please?

44:28.753 --> 44:31.103
He's a right grumpy bastard!

44:32.757 --> 44:35.716
Right, I'm going back down.

Here, girls.

45:26.549 --> 45:28.377
[whistling]

45:28.421 --> 45:30.379
Come on, come to daddy.

45:53.533 --> 45:54.752
You on the train yet?

45:54.795 --> 45:57.189
Look, you gotta get
off at Blackpool north.

45:58.538 --> 46:00.105
I told you to keep
your phone on.

46:01.236 --> 46:01.759
Fuck.

[relaxing instrumental music]

46:33.834 --> 46:34.661
Fuck.

[relaxing instrumental music]

47:21.186 --> 47:26.191
You got our room?

47:38.072 --> 47:39.595
Life goes on, Joe.

Remember?

Wow.

48:44.095 --> 48:47.054
[chuckling]

48:47.098 --> 48:48.664
I mean, I know I asked
you to show me the sights,

48:48.708 --> 48:50.797
but that's not
really what I meant.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.841
Oh...

48:51.885 --> 48:52.799
Got back at night,

48:52.842 --> 48:55.106
think I didn't need anything.

48:55.149 --> 48:57.369
You realize you've probably
scarred me for life?

48:57.412 --> 48:59.240
Well, I'd love to
stand and chat...

49:00.198 --> 49:02.200
I have a very fragile mind.

49:02.243 --> 49:03.244
Will you move your foot.

49:03.288 --> 49:04.332
Yeah.

49:09.381 --> 49:10.121
All right.

49:10.164 --> 49:11.513
What's the magic word?

49:11.557 --> 49:12.558
Now.

49:15.169 --> 49:16.649
You've gotta lighten up, Joe.

49:16.692 --> 49:17.998
Life goes on.

49:21.175 --> 49:22.655
I need to get dressed.

49:22.698 --> 49:25.136
Yeah, you really do.

[mysterious rock music]

Oh, fuck.

So beautiful,

50:33.639 --> 50:34.466
so sad.

50:39.775 --> 50:42.039
Do you think they know
that they're trapped?

50:43.344 --> 50:47.305
You're only trapped if
you allow yourself to be.

51:31.349 --> 51:33.568
So why did you have a
gun stuck in your face?

51:37.355 --> 51:38.660
He thinks I stole from him.

51:39.748 --> 51:40.575
Did you?

51:43.274 --> 51:45.058
Trust me, he stole
from me first.

51:54.633 --> 51:55.677
It's funny...

52:00.639 --> 52:01.683
I feel safe with you.

52:05.557 --> 52:06.775
No one's safe with me.

52:23.357 --> 52:24.706
My mom used to
disappear for days

52:24.750 --> 52:26.534
when she was on
one of her benders.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.581
She'd come crawling back,

52:29.624 --> 52:31.278
promising it wasn't
gonna happen again.

52:32.366 --> 52:33.193
Until it did.

52:39.547 --> 52:41.462
Jim next door used
to take me in.

52:42.507 --> 52:44.291
I was a nosy little kid.

52:44.335 --> 52:45.379
Never!

52:52.386 --> 52:53.648
One day I found all these books

52:53.692 --> 52:54.780
in Jim's spare room.

52:55.781 --> 52:57.174
All these kids books.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.655
He never had any kids,

53:00.699 --> 53:02.048
so I always thought
that was weird.

53:04.137 --> 53:05.704
I used to read them for hours.

53:07.271 --> 53:08.359
Just getting lost in them.

53:12.363 --> 53:13.755
I got to the point where
I actually started praying

53:13.799 --> 53:15.235
my mom wouldn't home come

53:15.279 --> 53:18.369
so I could just take
myself away and escape.

53:27.073 --> 53:30.076
One day she gave them
to me, a whole box.

53:31.077 --> 53:32.383
Ah, it was the best thing ever.

53:33.819 --> 53:35.255
The first thing I did

53:35.299 --> 53:37.344
was write my name
in every single one,

53:37.388 --> 53:38.650
make sure they were mine.

53:42.697 --> 53:45.222
She wouldn't take them back.

53:51.837 --> 53:55.144
One day I came home,
and they'd all gone.

53:56.450 --> 53:58.104
Except the one I was reading.

54:01.499 --> 54:04.371
I found out my mom had
taken the whole lot

54:04.415 --> 54:05.807
and tried to swap them for gear.

54:07.287 --> 54:09.768
She couldn't, she just
left them somewhere.

54:09.811 --> 54:12.510
She couldn't even
remember where.

54:13.859 --> 54:16.514
All the shit she heaped
on me, all the drama.

54:18.516 --> 54:23.390
It was the one thing I
never forgave her for.

54:30.528 --> 54:32.181
When she died, I felt nothing.

54:35.533 --> 54:40.538
What happened then?

54:42.148 --> 54:44.063
Four years in care,
and then I ran away.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.241
Dex took me off the streets,

54:48.285 --> 54:50.199
and I thought all my
problems were over.

54:53.507 --> 54:56.293
Compared to him, my mom
was Mary freakin' Poppins.

55:06.607 --> 55:08.479
You know, even with all
the shit that's happened,

55:08.522 --> 55:10.350
I've never wanted to top myself.

55:12.396 --> 55:15.050
There's always good stuff
to balance out the bad.

55:19.577 --> 55:20.665
Can I ask you something?

55:22.449 --> 55:23.276
No.

55:28.237 --> 55:30.762
Did you really
wanna kill yourself?

55:30.805 --> 55:32.329
Or was it like a cry for help?

55:33.547 --> 55:34.505
A cry for help?

55:41.512 --> 55:43.514
I saw you pick up the
gun in the bathroom.

55:52.523 --> 55:54.655
More effective than
pills, don't you think?

55:59.138 --> 56:03.229
There are over 1,500 different
species of jellyfish.

56:05.449 --> 56:06.798
Certain higher medusa jellyfish

56:08.147 --> 56:09.409
only live for a few hours.

56:10.671 --> 56:12.369
But in those few hours,

56:13.848 --> 56:18.375
they glow with the most
incredible luminescence.

56:18.418 --> 56:20.464
They reproduce.

56:20.507 --> 56:25.120
They do everything they were
brought on this earth to do.

yes or a no then?

57:48.073 --> 57:49.596
[Ria] The gun.

57:49.640 --> 57:51.163
What do you think?

57:51.206 --> 57:53.165
[Ria] How am I supposed to know?

57:53.208 --> 57:54.601
Well, come on.

57:54.645 --> 57:56.821
You have an opinion
about everything else.

57:56.864 --> 57:57.648
All right.

57:57.691 --> 57:59.519
I mean I think that...

I think...

Shit.

58:02.261 --> 58:04.045
I need to find a phone.

Yeah, what?

58:14.403 --> 58:15.230
A solid phone, that is.

58:16.493 --> 58:19.365
I once stored that in
a vat of liquid cashew.

58:19.408 --> 58:21.672
I was helping my brother
on one of his farms.

58:23.282 --> 58:26.024
Then when we retrieved it,
I had three missed calls.

58:26.067 --> 58:27.329
Didn't miss a beat.

them clever smartphones.

to be here now,

go, then just go.

Look, remember when I said
that if you save a life,

59:36.224 --> 59:37.530
you are then responsible
for that life.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.663
Yeah, you are responsible
for that life, yeah.

what I think Joseph,

what I really think?

59:52.850 --> 59:55.200
I think I've taken more
tablets for a headache.

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:02.163
I think you're a hero.

in shining armor.

I didn't save you, you saved me.

No.

Stop!

You don't know me.

You don't know what
I'm capable of.

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.663
Listen, I know exactly
what you're capable of,

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:25.186
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.623
Do you want me to spell it out,

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:27.798
is that what you want?
