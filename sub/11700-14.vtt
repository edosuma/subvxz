WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.172
OH, HEY,
WHAT'S UP GUYS?

00:05.172 --> 00:06.173
HEY, BEN.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.741
WHAT'S GOING ON, BEN?

00:07.741 --> 00:09.076
HOW WAS
YOUR NIGHT, BEN?

00:09.076 --> 00:12.312
WE WERE JUST WONDERING
HOW THAT EMERGENCY
TURNED OUT, BEN.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.680
WHAT EMERGENCY?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.349
OH, YOU REMEMBER.

00:15.349 --> 00:19.419
THE "CAN SOMEBODY PICK UP EMMA,
IT'S AN EMERGENCY" EMERGENCY.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.189
TURNS OUT, IT WAS LESS
OF AN EMERGENCY,

00:22.189 --> 00:23.590
AND MORE OF
AN AFTER-WORK PUB CRAWL.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.159
WHICH IS FUNNY,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE WORK IN A BAR.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.296
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

00:29.296 --> 00:31.164
FOR THE LAST SIX HOURS

00:31.164 --> 00:34.134
EMMA HAS BEEN PASSED AROUND
MORE THAN A JOINT AT
A BON JOVI CONCERT.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.670
I HEAR.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.173
OR YOUR MOM
ON LADIES' NIGHT.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.544
YEAH. I HAD TO
PICK HER UP FROM DAYCARE,
AND I MISSED PRACTICE.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.746
YEAH, SO I TOOK HER NEXT
AND I MISSED A DEPOSITION.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.248
YEAH, THEN SHE PASSED HER
ON TO ME, AND I MISSED
AN INTERVIEW.

00:48.248 --> 00:51.518
SO, HE PASSED HER TO ME,
AND I MISSED A DATE
WITH A SURE THING.

00:51.518 --> 00:54.321
WHO I, COINCIDENTALLY,
MET AT LADIES' NIGHT.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.558
SO, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

00:57.558 --> 01:00.260
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A PRETTY WELL-OILED MACHINE
TO ME.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.395
THANKS FOR HELPING OUT.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.563
-WHAT?
-BUT--

01:02.563 --> 01:04.264
"THANKS FOR
HELPING OUT"?

01:04.264 --> 01:06.667
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
WHEN SOMEBODY TAKES YOU
TO THE AIRPORT,

01:06.667 --> 01:08.602
NOT RAISES YOUR CHILD
FOR YOU.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.171
UH, RAISING MY CHILD?

01:11.171 --> 01:13.140
I'VE BEEN A SINGLE DAD
FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.441
I'VE KIND OF GOT IT DOWN.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.177
YEAH. BY HAVING EVERYONE ELSE
DO ALL THE WORK.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.546
WELL, I HAVE A SYSTEM,
OBVIOUSLY.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.684
OKAY. SO, YOU ACTUALLY THINK
THAT YOU COULD DO ALL OF THIS
WITHOUT US?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.152
YEAH, TOTALLY.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.054
-OH, GREAT. FREES UP
A LOT OF TIME.
-OH, YEAH, WOW.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.457
SAYS THE BOY WHO FORGOT
TO FEED SEVEN HAMSTERS
AND THEY ALL DIED.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.592
GOOD LUCK!

01:36.296 --> 01:39.766
(scoffs) I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MY OWN KID.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.101
WAIT, WHERE IS SHE?

01:41.101 --> 01:44.104
<i>(theme music plays)</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:47.140
<i>♪ IT'S AMAZING HOW</i>
<i>THE UNEXPECTED ♪</i>

01:47.140 --> 01:50.243
<i>♪ CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE</i>
<i>AND CHANGE DIRECTION ♪</i>

01:54.047 --> 01:55.148
Ben:
<i>OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD</i>

01:55.148 --> 01:57.184
OH MY GOD, SO LATE, SO LATE.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.285
WE NEED A SHIRT. SHIRT. YES!

01:58.285 --> 02:00.654
OKAY. UH, SOCKS. SOCKS.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.289
UH, ONE SOCK IS GOOD, RIGHT?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.357
THAT'S FASHION-Y.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.625
OH, GOD.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.161
HAIR, HAIR. A BABY COMB OVER.
TOTALLY IN.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.529
UM, ALL RIGHT, LUNCH.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.431
LUNCH, LUNCH, LUNCH,
LUNCH, LUNCH.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.401
UH, GREAT. NOTHING IN HERE.

02:14.401 --> 02:18.338
OKAY, WELL, NOW SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO FIND OUT IF
YOU LIKE KUNG PAO CHICKEN.

02:18.338 --> 02:21.541
ALL RIGHT, KEYS, WALLET, PHONE
BINKY, TIE,

02:21.541 --> 02:23.343
AND DIAPER BAG.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.444
YEAH!

02:24.444 --> 02:28.015
SEE? I TOTALLY GOT THIS!

02:29.483 --> 02:32.185
HE SO DON'T GOT THIS.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.388
I LIKED YESTERDAY'S EPISODE
SO MUCH MORE

02:34.388 --> 02:36.023
WHEN THEY BOTH LEFT
WITHOUT THEIR SHOES.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.324
(laughing)

02:37.324 --> 02:38.659
(phone buzzing)

02:40.227 --> 02:42.329
OH. DAMN IT!

02:42.329 --> 02:45.032
JUDY BAKER BACKED OUT OF
TAKING A COOKING CLASS WITH ME,

02:45.032 --> 02:46.333
AND IT'S NONREFUNDABLE.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.035
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.603
YOU PAID FOR SOMETHING?

02:51.238 --> 02:54.141
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T.
SHE DID.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.177
SO, WHO WANTS TO TAKE
A FREE COOKING CLASS?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.447
IT'S WITH TOMMY KWAN,
NEW YORK'S HOTTEST CHEF.

03:00.447 --> 03:03.316
AND, I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT HIS COOKING SKILLS.

03:03.316 --> 03:04.685
OH, I WATCH HIM EVERY WEEK.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.253
I LOVE THAT SHOW!

03:06.253 --> 03:10.123
Danny and Bonnie:
LET'S TURN UP THE HEAT,
IT'S TIME TO EAT!

03:10.123 --> 03:12.025
WELL, THE BEST COOK IN THE CLASS

03:12.025 --> 03:15.328
GETS TO WORK SIDE-BY-SIDE
WITH HIM IN HIS RESTAURANT
FOR ONE NIGHT.

03:15.328 --> 03:18.432
IT IS ON MY LIST OF THINGS TO DO
BEFORE I DIE.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.268
AND, COINCIDENTALLY,
SO IS TOMMY.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.305
HEY, I'LL TAKE THAT CLASS
WITH YOU.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.574
IT'LL BE FUN. IT'LL TOTALLY
IMPRESS ASHLEY.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.243
OOH, ASHLEY, THE NEW GIRLFRIEND.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.245
HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD YOU TALK
TOO MUCH ABOUT HER.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.182
IN FACT, I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD
YOU TALK TOO MUCH TO ME, LATELY,

03:35.182 --> 03:38.752
SO, HOW'S IT GOING? IS SHE FUN?
DO YOU LIKE HER?
ANY JUICY DETAILS?

03:38.752 --> 03:41.421
REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO INTERFERE
WITH MY LOVE LIFE?

03:41.421 --> 03:44.491
NO. THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE ME, AT ALL.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.692
I GOTTA GO.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.295
OH, OKAY. WELL,
YOU KNOW, WE'LL
CHAT MORE, LATER.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.063
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
HEY, DON'T BE A STRANGER.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.298
YOU KNOW I'M JUST
RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.699
SO, I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.501
AND BY NEIGHBORHOOD,
I MEAN 4C.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.503
(door closes)

03:56.503 --> 03:58.238
I THINK HE GOT IT.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.110
(groans)

04:05.679 --> 04:07.013
TUCKER,

04:07.013 --> 04:08.982
(groans)

04:08.982 --> 04:11.718
IT'S THE UNIVERSAL SIGN
FOR SOMEONE IN DISTRESS.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.420
AND NOT MAKING
EYE CONTACT

04:13.420 --> 04:17.257
IS THE UNIVERSAL SIGN
FOR LEAVE ME ALONE,
I AM BLOWING STUFF UP.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.596
DANNY IS COMPLETELY
AVOIDING ME.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.233
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S
ACTING WEIRD BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
THAT I HAD FEELINGS FOR HIM?

04:26.233 --> 04:30.403
NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY
THAT YOU KNEW HE LIKED YOU,
AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

04:30.403 --> 04:32.439
AND THEN YOU STARTED DATING
A PARADE OF OTHER GUYS.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.575
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GUESSING, SO...

04:37.010 --> 04:39.613
GOD, I JUST WANT THINGS
TO GO BACK TO THE WAY
THEY USED TO BE.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.314
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE TOLD
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

04:41.314 --> 04:45.352
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'D
BE LESS AWKWARD IF
YOU WERE DATING SOMEONE TOO?

04:45.352 --> 04:46.553
YOU KNOW,
TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.723
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
LIE ABOUT HAVING A BOYFRIEND?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.525
OKAY.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.427
YOU KNOW HOW I'VE BEEN
DATING CHRISTINE FOR
THE LAST MONTH?

04:54.427 --> 04:56.096
YEAH.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.498
WELL, CHRISTINE STOPPED
RETURNING MY PHONE CALLS
TWO WEEKS AGO.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.467
BUT I'M TOO TIRED
OF BEING THE DUMPEE.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.369
SO, I'M FAKING OUR RELATIONSHIP
FOR ANOTHER MONTH

05:02.369 --> 05:04.404
UNTIL I DUMP HER.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.574
OH, BY THE WAY,
SHE IS GONNA BE DEVASTATED.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.576
(laughing)

05:09.576 --> 05:11.511
FAKING A RELATIONSHIP?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.381
OH MY GOD,
THAT'S BRILLIANT!

05:14.381 --> 05:18.084
HEY, LOOK, IT'S EASY.
YOU JUST HAVE TO, YOU KNOW,
PLANT A FEW SEEDS.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.221
-MM-HMM.
-RIGHT? START TALKING ABOUT
THE CUTE GUY AT THE COFFEE SHOP.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.690
AND THEN, MAYBE IN A WEEK,
YOU GUYS GO OUT.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.160
YOU KNOW, JUST TAKE IT SLOW
AND NOBODY WILL BE SUSPICIOUS.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.762
TAKE IT SLOW.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.431
OH HEY,
FORGOT MY WALLET.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.968
HEY, DANNY!
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!

05:41.308 --> 05:43.009
EXCUSE ME?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.044
EXCUSE ME?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.478
SORRY, JUST A LITTLE BUSY
OVER HERE.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.313
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

05:46.313 --> 05:47.447
YOU CAN GET ME
A COSMOPOLITAN,

05:47.447 --> 05:49.616
AND TAKE BACK YOUR BABY.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.521
-OH, CICI? CICI?
-NOPE.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.389
OH MY GOD, TUCKER, HEY!

05:56.389 --> 05:57.457
YOU GOTTA
TAKE EMMA.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.159
WE GOT KICKED OUT
OF DAYCARE.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.528
APPARENTLY, IF YOU'RE LATE
TO PICKUP THREE TIMES,
YOU'RE OUT.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.430
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK THEY'D
GIVE YOU SOME KIND
OF WARNING.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.432
SOUNDS LIKE
THEY GAVE YOU TWO.

06:05.432 --> 06:09.069
COME ON, MAN!
I ACTUALLY HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.538
IT'S THE FIRST GIRL
I'VE GONE OUT WITH
SINCE RILEY AND I BROKE UP.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.374
I JUST HOPE RILEY
WILL BE COOL WITH IT.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.411
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DID JUST HEAR THAT SHE
KINDA HAS A BOYFRIEND.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.381
SO, I'M GONNA GO WITH, UM,
YEAH, SHE'LL BE COOL WITH THAT.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.083
OH, SHE DOES?

06:23.083 --> 06:25.352
SO, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY MOVED ON,

06:25.352 --> 06:27.053
WHICH IS GREAT,

06:27.053 --> 06:28.088
'CAUSE I'M MOVING ON TOO.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.389
I MEAN, YOU THINK
I SHOULD, RIGHT?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.724
YUP. I WOULD.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.659
OKAY, COOL.
SO, YOU'LL
WATCH EMMA FOR ME?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.494
OH, HELL, NO!

06:34.494 --> 06:36.663
NO, YOU ARE
ON YOUR OWN, SINGLE DAD.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.132
CHRISTINE AND I
ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.068
HOT DATE
WITH MY HOT LADY.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.540
DANNY, DANNY, GOOD NEWS.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.676
I MANAGED TO TASTE
EVERYONE'S FOOD,

06:49.676 --> 06:51.344
AND IT ALL TASTES
LIKE ASS.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.714
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT I ACTUALLY
REALLY LIKE MINE.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.284
DANNY! YOU CAN'T EAT THAT!

06:57.284 --> 07:01.621
TOMMY HAS TO TASTE IT,
REVIEW IT, TELL YOU HOW
YOU CAN IMPROVE IT.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.657
OR, HOW IT'S
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.525
AND HOW HE WISHES
YOU WERE ON THE MENU.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.559
(laughs)

07:06.559 --> 07:08.028
OH, HERE HE COMES,
HERE HE COMES!

07:08.028 --> 07:09.696
OKAY, LADIES.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.699
HOPEFULLY YOU'VE FOLLOWED
MY ASSISTANTS INSTRUCTIONS
ON THIS RECIPE.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.402
BECAUSE I'M TOO YOUNG
AND SUCCESSFUL TO DIE.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.404
(laughing obnoxiously)

07:20.573 --> 07:22.575
(coughs)

07:22.575 --> 07:27.380
I WOULDN'T SERVE THAT
TO MY EX WIFE, AND I ACTUALLY
WANT TO POISON HER.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.349
(laughing)
CLASSIC TOMMY.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.151
OKAY.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.154
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO DISAPPOINT MY PALATE.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.089
HI. I'M BONNIE,

07:36.089 --> 07:39.559
AND I HAVE MADE YOUR
"CHICKEN TOMMY"
A THOUSAND TIMES.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.628
THEN A THOUSAND CHICKENS
DIED FOR NOTHING.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.231
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.033
OH, UM...

07:47.033 --> 07:49.436
I'M JUST KIND OF TALL,
SO IT MAKES THE CHICKEN
LOOK REALLY SMALL.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.139
MAN.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.674
THAT'S GOOD.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.510
AND I SAY, "MAN"
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SAID THAT
TO A WOMAN.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.378
(laughing)

08:00.447 --> 08:02.716
REALLY?
I JUST FOLLOWED
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.385
MY COACH ALWAYS SAYS
I DO BETTER WHEN I DON'T
THINK FOR MYSELF.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.253
EXCELLENT ADVICE.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.489
ONE YOU LITTLE LADIES
SHOULD FOLLOW.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.391
WHO'S NEXT?

08:11.391 --> 08:13.760
(gasps)
WHOA.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.362
WHO KNEW I HAD
A HIDDEN TALENT?

08:15.362 --> 08:18.164
HONEY, THE ONLY THING
YOU HAVE THAT I DON'T
IS WHAT'S IN YOUR PANTS.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.368
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU SAW ME TAKE THIS.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.539
TUCKER!

08:26.539 --> 08:28.008
TUCKER, TUCKER, TUCKER,

08:29.075 --> 08:33.613
ARE YOU READY FOR
OUR AWESOME DOUBLE DATE

08:33.613 --> 08:36.149
WITH CHRISTINE
AND MY NEW BOYFRIEND, JUSTIN?

08:36.149 --> 08:39.185
-DANNY'S IN HIS ROOM.
-OH.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.388
-OH, HEY.
-HEY, DANNY!

08:41.388 --> 08:43.990
I'M JUST HERE FOR
MY AWESOME DOUBLE DATE

08:43.990 --> 08:45.658
WITH TUCKER AND CHRISTINE

08:45.658 --> 08:47.660
AND MY NEW BOYFRIEND, JUSTIN.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.462
WE ARE GOING TO THAT
NEW CLUB ON CANAL.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.531
OH, RIGHT.
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.200
WELL, HEY, MAYBE ASHLEY
AND I CAN MEET UP
WITH YOU LATER?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.637
UH... YEAH...

08:57.637 --> 09:00.473
YOU HAVE TO BE
ON A LIST.

09:00.473 --> 09:06.513
YEAH. YEAH, MY BOYFRIEND,
JUSTIN, HAD TO PULL
A LOT OF STRINGS.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.548
HE'S SUPER CONNECTED.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.152
NOT CONNECTED ENOUGH
TO GET YOU IN, SORRY.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.186
YUP.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.088
WELL, HEY,
DO YOU WANT TO
SHARE A CAB?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.656
NO. GOD, STOP
FOLLOWING US.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.492
-HEY.
-EXCUSE ME.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.628
OH, HI.
YOU MUST BE MARISSA.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.163
SORRY.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.264
FOR WHAT?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.433
I'M SURE
IT'LL BE SOMETHING.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.070
HELLO?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.604
MARISSA, HEY. HEY.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.540
THANK YOU
FOR COMING OVER.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.408
EMMA IS ASLEEP
FOR THE NIGHT,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.110
THE TAKEOUT
IS ON ITS WAY,

09:37.110 --> 09:40.313
AND HER CRIB HAS WHEELS,
SO WE CAN ROLL IT OUT
OF THE BEDROOM

09:40.313 --> 09:42.715
IF YOU WANNA
SWINGITY-SWANGITY, BANG, BOOM.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.521
PROBABLY GETTING
A LITTLE AHEAD OF MYSELF.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.090
A LITTLE.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.292
-BUT, I LIKE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.
-OOH.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.162
<i>(Emma crying)</i>

09:56.162 --> 09:57.430
ARE YOU GONNA
GET THAT?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.065
YEAH, I PROBABLY SHOULD.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.204
HI, SWEETHEART.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.638
HEY, COME HERE.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.639
COME HERE.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.675
EMMA, YOU GOTTA
GO TO SLEEP.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.611
I'VE GOT A VERY HOT,
VERY SPECIAL FRIEND OUT THERE
WHO CAN...

10:11.611 --> 10:13.580
HEAR EVERYTHING

10:13.580 --> 10:14.747
<i>ON THE MONITOR CAN'T SHE?</i>

10:14.747 --> 10:18.251
YUP. BUT THANKS
FOR CALLING ME HOT.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.053
(whispering)
WORKS EVERY TIME.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.588
-(Emma coos)
-YEAH.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.497
BEN?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.034
(snoring)

10:36.669 --> 10:38.404
HI.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.412
WELL, IF TOMMY WANTS
TO BE INTIMIDATED BY A WOMAN,

10:46.412 --> 10:48.615
I THINK I JUST
GAVE HIM A REASON.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.150
HEY, MOM.
TRY MINE.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.088
OH MY GOD, DANNY.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.723
THAT TASTES
LIKE DISHWATER.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.658
WHERE DID YOU GET
YOUR WATER?

11:01.461 --> 11:02.595
(gags)

11:04.597 --> 11:06.499
BUT YOU JUST
GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.734
HEY, COULD YOU
GRAB ME THAT LADLE?

11:14.641 --> 11:16.643
AND SHE'S BACK.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.747
I'LL TRY TO GO EASY ON YOU
SINCE YOU'RE JUST A HOUSEWIFE.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.349
A HOUSEWIFE?

11:23.349 --> 11:28.388
YOU MEAN A WOMAN WHO DEVOTES
HER LIFE TO HER FAMILY,
HER KIDS, HER HOME,

11:28.388 --> 11:33.126
AND PUTTING A MEAL ON THE TABLE
THREE TIMES A DAY,
365 DAYS A YEAR?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.762
AH. IT'S EVEN SADDER
WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.998
OH.
(scoffs)

11:38.998 --> 11:43.236
WELL, I HOPE I DIDN'T
COOK WITH TOO MUCH ESTROGEN.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.639
OH, CRAP, I DIDN'T
PUT ANY OF THAT IN MINE.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.711
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
THIS MIGHT JUST BE
THE BEST SOUP I'VE EVER TASTED.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.383
CONGRATULATIONS DANNY,
YOU'LL BE MY GUEST SOUS-CHEF
THIS EVENING

11:57.383 --> 11:59.552
AH!

12:01.621 --> 12:05.325
I SWITCHED THE BOWLS.
THAT IS MY SOUP.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.760
-PROVE IT.
-I CAN'T!

12:09.629 --> 12:11.631
I DID NOT THINK
THAT ONE THROUGH.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.566
SO, YOU ARE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.601
WELL, I DON'T.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.970
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.006
BECAUSE MY SON
ACTUALLY RESPECTS WOMEN,

12:20.006 --> 12:24.077
AND HE WOULDN'T ACCEPT
YOUR BLATANTLY SEXIST HONOR
IF YOU PAID HIM.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.111
TELL HIM, DANNY.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.081
SO, WHAT TIME
DO YOU NEED ME HERE, TONIGHT?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.020
SO, ANYWAY,

12:34.020 --> 12:35.989
I THINK MY DATE
WENT PRETTY GOOD LAST NIGHT.

12:35.989 --> 12:40.627
WE JUST WENT STRAIGHT TO
THE SWINGITY-SWANG, BINGITY
BANG, BOOM, SWIGITY-SWANG.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.064
I FELL ASLEEP
IN BED WITH EMMA.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.736
-OH, HEY.
-GOD, YOU KNOW WHO'S
A GOOD KISSER?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.638
JUSTIN.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.506
OH. OH, DANNY, HI.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.707
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
WALK IN.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.708
HOW'S YOUR CLASS GOING?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.543
ACTUALLY, IT'S GREAT!

12:57.543 --> 12:59.279
TOMMY ASKED ME TO COOK
AT HIS RESTAURANT TONIGHT.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.514
WAIT, YOU'RE WORKING THERE?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.616
DUDE, OH MY GOD,
CAN YOU GET ME
A RESERVATION?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.318
HIS RESTAURANT
IS THE HOTTEST PLACE IN TOWN.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.986
MARISSA CAN'T TURN DOWN
A DO-OVER DATE THERE.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.688
-I CAN TRY.
-ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
WELL, HEY,
WHAT IF ALL YOU GUYS CAME?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.662
YOU AND CHRISTINE,
AND YOU AND JUSTIN.
I'D LOVE TO MEET HIM.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.264
UH...

13:18.264 --> 13:21.668
(scoffs)
CHRISTINE?
SHE'S A MODEL. YOU KNOW,

13:21.668 --> 13:23.336
SHE'S NOT REALLY
INTO FOOD.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.074
WE'D LOVE TO.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.710
JUSTIN, HE'S SCHEDULED
FOR SURGERY, BUT, PFFT,

13:30.710 --> 13:32.111
I'LL JUST HAVE HIM MOVE IT.

13:32.111 --> 13:35.048
YEAH, MY BOYFRIEND'S
A DOCTOR.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.383
COOL. I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.754
HEY, UM, RILEY?

13:41.754 --> 13:45.591
DO YOU THINK, MAYBE,
YOU CAN ASK YOUR DOCTOR
BOYFRIEND TO EXAMINE YOUR HEAD?

13:45.591 --> 13:49.228
YOU KNOW,
UNLESS CRAZY DOESN'T
SHOW UP ON X-RAYS.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.098
TUCKER, THIS IS
TOTALLY WORKING.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.967
I MEAN, DANNY IS FINALLY
TALKING TO ME AGAIN
THE WAY HE USED TO.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.370
YEAH. YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE TEENSY DETAIL.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.006
JUSTIN DOESN'T EXIST!

14:00.006 --> 14:02.975
YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.544
WHY CAN'T YOU BE
MORE LIKE JUSTIN?

14:08.081 --> 14:11.184
OKAY, EMMA,
THIS NEW BABYSITTER
IS CHARGING ME $20 AN HOUR

14:11.184 --> 14:13.186
SO, FEEL FREE TO BE
AS BRATTY AS YOU WANT.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.253
(knocking)

14:14.253 --> 14:15.722
WE NEED TO GET
OUR MONEY'S WORTH.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.027
-CAN I HELP YOU?
-YEAH, I'M MADISON.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.562
WE SPOKE
ON THE PHONE.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.663
SO, WHERE'S THE KID?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.765
STANDING ON MY DOORMAT.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.101
YOU SAID YOU HAD
10 YEARS EXPERIENCE?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.703
YEAH, I'M 10.
WELL, I WILL BE NEXT WEEK.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.107
BUH-BYE.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.444
GREAT. NOW WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:41.013 --> 14:42.582
EMMA, GRAB YOUR BINKIE!

14:42.582 --> 14:44.650
YOU'RE GOING ON YOUR FIRST DATE.

14:52.525 --> 14:56.028
HEY, UM, DO I STILL GET CHARGED
FRO TWO COATS IF I PUT HERS
IN MY POCKET?

14:56.028 --> 14:58.331
AWW, WHAT A LITTLE CUTIE!

14:58.331 --> 14:59.699
SHE'S ADORABLE.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.602
OH MY GOD, SHE MAKES ME MISS
MY BABY SISTER.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.970
I PRACTICALLY RAISED HER.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.738
REALLY?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.107
HEY, HOW MUCH IS IT
TO CHECK A BABY?

15:11.711 --> 15:14.147
HEY, MARISSA,
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.448
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.049
FANCY DINNER OUT?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.684
OH, SEVEN COURSES?

15:18.684 --> 15:21.087
MY BABYSITTER'S CHARGING ME
BY THE MINUTE. LET'S GET
CRACKING.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.357
WHERE ARE YOUR DATES?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.493
OH, UH, I JUST
TALKED TO JUSTIN,

15:27.493 --> 15:29.395
AND HE GOT PULLED
INTO SURGERY.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.665
AND CHRISTINE BOOKED
A LAST MINUTE GIG, SO
SHE'S GONNA BE RUNNING LATE TOO.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.001
BUT, THEY BOTH JUST
SENT US LOVELY TEXT MESSAGES.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.103
SO, NO REASON TO BE SUSPICIOUS.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.508
YEAH. YEAH, WHAT SHE SAID,
BUT LESS CRAZY.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.112
KIND OF A SLOW EATER,
AREN'T YOU?

15:51.017 --> 15:53.352
THERE HE IS.
READY TO SEE
HOW REAL MEN COOK?

15:53.352 --> 15:55.354
-YOU KNOW IT.
-GREAT. TELL ME WHAT
YOU THINK OF THIS.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.458
SALTY.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.525
AND A LITTLE WEIRD.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.395
OUT OF THE WAY, BOYS.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.530
TONIGHT, MAMA'S
MAKING DINNER.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.400
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU THINK
OF THIS HOUSEWIFE'S FOOD.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.302
MOM! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.070
I DEMAND A RE-TASTE.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.439
I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL
YOU TRY MY CHICKEN TOMMY,

16:13.439 --> 16:15.541
AND DECLARE ME
THE RIGHTFUL WINNER.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.176
YOU MEAN
INSTEAD OF YOUR SON?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.544
WHO YOU SUPPOSEDLY
LOVE AND SUPPORT?

16:18.544 --> 16:19.745
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

16:22.381 --> 16:23.416
TRY IT.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.084
OF COURSE.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.587
LET ME STOP COOKING
FOR A RESTAURANT FULL OF PEOPLE

16:27.587 --> 16:29.755
SO I CAN PULL UP A CHAIR,
EAT YOUR CHICKEN.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.058
AND APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING SO RUDE.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.193
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

16:34.193 --> 16:36.062
WANNA MAKE OUT?

16:37.763 --> 16:38.998
NO.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.300
HERE'S WHAT I THINK
OF YOUR FOOD.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.668
(plate shattering)

16:42.668 --> 16:44.070
NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

16:44.070 --> 16:45.238
SOMEBODY GET A MOP!

16:45.238 --> 16:46.405
(gasps)

16:46.405 --> 16:49.141
FRANCOIS, HELP BOBBY!

16:49.141 --> 16:50.643
WHOA!

16:50.643 --> 16:52.044
IT'S JUST A LITTLE--

16:52.044 --> 16:53.145
WHOA!

16:53.145 --> 16:56.182
(dishes clattering)

16:56.182 --> 16:58.084
(shouts)

17:04.290 --> 17:06.225
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:06.225 --> 17:08.027
YOU CAN TRY IT LATER.

17:11.430 --> 17:15.067
HEY, WE'RE READY
FOR THE NEXT COURSE, GUY.
LET'S KEEP IT COMING, EH?

17:15.067 --> 17:17.236
RILEY, WHERE'S
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

17:17.236 --> 17:19.138
UH, HE'S UM, HE'S...

17:19.138 --> 17:21.107
WHAT DID I SAY
HE WAS DOING, TUCKER?

17:21.107 --> 17:24.076
OH MY GOD, YOU ARE
TERRIBLE AT THIS!

17:24.076 --> 17:27.547
LOOK, I'M DONE,
WE'RE DONE, JUSTIN'S NOT REAL.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.081
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"NOT REAL"?

17:29.081 --> 17:30.316
HE'S NOT REAL PUNCTUAL.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.118
OH MY GOD, LOOK,
HERE HE IS NOW.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.587
HI, HONEY!

17:34.587 --> 17:36.155
OH, YOU MADE IT!

17:36.155 --> 17:38.057
UH, JUSTIN,
THIS IS DANNY.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.593
DANNY, THIS IS MY JUSTIN.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.296
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.
WE NEED A DOCTOR IN THE KITCHEN!

17:43.296 --> 17:44.530
WHAT THE HELL?

17:44.530 --> 17:45.731
WE JUST MADE OUT
IN THE COAT ROOM,

17:45.731 --> 17:48.034
AND NOW YOU'RE
KISSING SOME RANDOM SKANK?

17:50.136 --> 17:52.271
JUSTIN, HOW COULD YOU?

17:52.271 --> 17:54.173
I BET YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A REAL DOCTOR!

17:57.009 --> 18:00.012
YOU SHOULD BE REAL GLAD
I HAVE AN EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.481
WAIT, HEY, HEY,
WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH MY KID?

18:02.481 --> 18:03.683
YOU BROUGHT YOUR KID?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.351
EMMA!

18:05.351 --> 18:07.286
OH, YEAH, SHE REALLY WANTED
TO COME, TONIGHT.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.120
SHE'S KIND OF
A FOODIE.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.989
TUCKER, HELP ME
CATCH HER!

18:12.291 --> 18:13.759
TUCKER?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.127
CHRISTINE?

18:15.127 --> 18:19.298
OH. I GUESS I KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.533
-TUCKER--
-NO, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

18:20.533 --> 18:23.235
I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING
TO DATE YOU FOR TWO WEEKS,

18:23.235 --> 18:25.471
AND THAT WAS MORE FUN
THAN THE TWO WEEKS
WE DID DATE.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.041
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM BETTER OFF WITH FAKE YOU.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.743
SO, ENJOY YOUR STUPID DATE.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.478
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.247
MY PHONE WAS STOLEN
AND I LOST YOUR NUMBER,

18:35.247 --> 18:37.149
SO I WASN'T ABLE TO TELL YOU
THAT I HAD TO GO

18:37.149 --> 18:39.552
TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL
IN CALIFORNIA.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.587
I JUST GOT BACK, TODAY.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.490
AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE ALL OF THAT?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.325
BECAUSE I DO, GIRL,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.260
(scoffs)
YEAH, SO AM I.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.029
DON'T CALL ME.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.130
EMMA?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.498
OH, HEY, CHRISTINE,
YOU MADE IT!

18:54.066 --> 18:55.067
EMMA!

18:56.268 --> 18:57.403
THIS IS A DISASTER!

18:57.403 --> 18:59.005
DANNY, START
PLATING MY CHICKEN.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.208
AH! HOT!

19:02.208 --> 19:03.442
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

19:03.442 --> 19:06.278
THAT'S IT!
TELL EVERYBODY TO GO HOME.
WE'RE DONE.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.181
OH, CALM DOWN, TOM-TOM.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.218
CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE SPILL
AND SOME FOOD ON THE GROUND?

19:12.218 --> 19:14.086
TRY GETTING DINNER
ON THE TABLE EVERY NIGHT

19:14.086 --> 19:17.056
WITH TWO KIDS AND 12 OF
THEIR FRIENDS PLAYING DODGEBALL
IN THE KITCHEN.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.124
I GOT THIS.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.127
DANNY, GET MAMA'S CHICKEN.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.261
YES, MA'AM.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.629
WAIT, YOU CAN'T
SERVE THAT!

19:23.629 --> 19:26.332
YOU'D RATHER LOSE
A RESTAURANT FULL OF CUSTOMERS

19:26.332 --> 19:28.100
THAN SERVE A WOMAN'S FOOD?

19:28.100 --> 19:32.271
AT LEAST A HOUSEWIFE
DOESN'T CRACK UNDER PRESSURE
LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

19:32.271 --> 19:36.075
DANNY, THROW SOME ASPARAGUS
ON A PLATE AND PUT MY CHICKEN
ON TOP OF IT.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.511
BOBBY, POUR SOME OF MY SAUCE
ON EVERYTHING.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.181
AND FRANCOIS, JUST THROW
SOME GREEN CRAP AROUND
THE PLATE TO FANCY IT UP.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.449
OH, AND TOMMY,

19:43.449 --> 19:46.285
JUST KEEP WHINING
LIKE A BABY.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.488
LET'S TURN UP THE HEAT,
IT'S TIME TO EAT!

19:49.488 --> 19:52.591
GARY, DON'T JUST STAND THERE!
I'M GONNA NEED MORE WINE!

19:52.591 --> 19:54.293
LET'S DO THIS, PEOPLE!

19:59.165 --> 20:01.067
Ben:
MY BAD, MY BAD. LOOK OUT.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.236
OH, HEY, A DOLLAR!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.008
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARISSA?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.343
TURNS OUT,
SHE WASN'T A GIANT FAN
OF THE BABY.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.079
AND JUSTIN?

20:13.079 --> 20:15.981
YEAH, TURNS OUT HE'S
A GIANT LIAR.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.616
AND CHRISTINE?

20:17.616 --> 20:20.519
TURNS OUT,
I'M A GIANT IDIOT.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.122
WELL, THEN I GUESS
IT'S JUST US.

20:23.122 --> 20:26.225
HERE'S TO ANOTHER
UNSUCCESSFUL ROMANTIC EVENING.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.360
WE'LL ALL GET THIS DOWN
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

20:28.360 --> 20:29.662
PROBABLY NOT.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.230
THAT'S WHAT THIS WINE IS FOR.

20:33.632 --> 20:38.003
(applause)

20:38.003 --> 20:40.005
WELL, MOM...

20:40.005 --> 20:41.507
I THINK THEY LOVE
YOUR CHICKEN TOMMY.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.710
YOU MEAN,
CHICKEN BONNIE.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.212
(whispering)
IT'S NOT CHICKEN.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.352
OKAY, SO THANK YOU ALL
FOR GATHERING.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.287
THIS'LL BE EASIER TO SAY
JUST ONCE.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.022
LOOK.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.325
I WAS WRONG, YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.559
I COULDN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

21:00.559 --> 21:05.064
IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE,
AND I TOOK MY VILLAGE
FOR GRANTED.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.967
SO, CAN YOU ALL FORGIVE ME?

21:07.967 --> 21:11.003
AND HELP ME?

21:11.003 --> 21:13.405
-OH, SWEETIE, OF COURSE.
-HEY, EMMA.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.174
-EMMA, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
-COME HERE, GIRL.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.677
NO, NO. OH, SHE WANTS TO COME
TO THE MAYOR OF THE VILLAGE.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.446
(all arguing)
