CAROL:<i> Tandy saw the fire.</i>
<i>He got water from the pool</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:24.823
<i>until the fire was out.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:26.825
Tandy did his time.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.627
How are things
with you and Todd?

00:28.629 --> 00:29.995
MELISSA:
<i>He's just been kind of weird.</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:31.930
Daddy's home.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.435
TANDY:
What a beautiful night.

00:39.739 --> 00:43.509
Hey, I want to take the floor

00:43.511 --> 00:44.977
real quick.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.212
Look, I know where
I stand here, you know?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.914
You guys let me out of the shed
for good behavior,

00:48.916 --> 00:50.649
but I know I still
have a ways to go

00:50.651 --> 00:53.485
before I'm fully back
in this community, you know?

00:53.487 --> 00:55.587
Yeah, I-I just hope
you guys give me a chance,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.589
'cause I really care
about you.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.924
And I look forward
to showing you that

00:58.926 --> 01:00.559
without a gun
pointed in your face.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.927
I know, I know.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.028
Actions not words,

01:03.030 --> 01:06.532
but the actions are coming.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.100
I have an action for you.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.368
Give me a little wine.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.036
Gail, thank you.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.571
And one wine coming up.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.606
(whining):
Oh!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.675
Why are we
sitting out here?

01:16.677 --> 01:17.709
It's too cold!

01:17.711 --> 01:20.679
I want to go back inside, Mommy!

01:20.681 --> 01:22.181
Boom.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.950
Still got it.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.152
(crickets trilling)

01:30.423 --> 01:33.392
Crickets!
Crickets are alive!

01:33.394 --> 01:34.860
(excited, overlapping
chattering)
Oh! Oh, no way!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.929
(chattering continues)

01:41.701 --> 01:43.869
(chattering continues)

01:43.871 --> 01:45.637
All right.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.774
Presenting,
for the first time ever,

01:48.776 --> 01:50.542
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

01:50.544 --> 01:53.145
cricket casserole!

01:53.147 --> 01:54.446
(laughs)

01:57.117 --> 01:58.884
Is that what
you were working on

01:58.886 --> 02:00.652
so long in the kitchen?

02:00.654 --> 02:01.887
Yep.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.555
It took longer than I thought,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.958
because I didn't realize
how hard they are to kill.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.229
I have to admit I felt
a little intimidated--

02:10.231 --> 02:12.965
Gail being a trained chef
and all.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.734
Did you ever make
anything like this, Gail?

02:15.736 --> 02:17.970
I did not.

02:17.972 --> 02:21.473
Look, it might seem
a little wonker-bonkers,

02:21.475 --> 02:23.775
but I was reading
in<i> Indian Vogue</i>

02:23.777 --> 02:26.278
that crickets were
all the rage over there.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.314
Uh-huh, they're
full of protein and fiber.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.016
They're also
full of bug guts.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.185
We're all full of guts.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.354
But we're running
out of options, aren't we?

02:35.356 --> 02:38.357
All our canned goods
have already expired.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.493
There are no fish
and no animals,

02:41.495 --> 02:44.596
except for the cow and she's
not gonna live forever, so...

02:44.598 --> 02:46.632
(chuckles)
like it or not,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.233
you're looking at our future.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.505
Anyway, to the future.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.278
Mmm.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.780
Hmm, mm-hmm.

03:07.654 --> 03:11.023
Anybody else? No?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.792
It's okay.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.161
Just wanted to do something nice
for the group.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.864
And I spent a lot of time on it.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.533
(stammers)
No, Carol, we-we'll try it.

03:22.635 --> 03:23.835
We'll try it, right?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.971
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.874
Go ahead, it's good.
Mmm.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.548
Mmm.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.986
This is re... You certainly
have a way with crickets.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.322
Oh, get a room.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.690
Hey, Todd, you haven't
even touched yours.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.857
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just,

03:45.859 --> 03:47.392
I'm not feeling very well.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.694
Well, that's too bad.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.395
It really dances
on your tongue.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.197
Ooh! Oh.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.765
This one's not dead.

03:53.767 --> 03:54.900
(crunches)

03:54.902 --> 03:56.401
Ah, now he is.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.706
Here, cricket, cricket.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
Don't you want to get turned

04:02.710 --> 04:04.910
into a disgusting meal
by my wife?

04:04.912 --> 04:07.179
Okay, let's see if this works.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.513
Has anybody ever noticed

04:08.515 --> 04:10.916
you can get salmonella
from chicken,

04:10.918 --> 04:14.186
but you can't get
chicken-monella from salmon?

04:14.188 --> 04:17.122
Boom.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.324
Nothing?

04:23.796 --> 04:26.598
Huh...

04:52.492 --> 04:55.627
♪ ♪

05:00.967 --> 05:03.035
(motor humming nearby)

05:10.643 --> 05:12.978
(motor humming)

05:19.018 --> 05:21.019
Oh... my...

05:21.021 --> 05:22.821
God.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.261
Good morning.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.263
I'm about to fry up
some cricket poppers!

05:31.265 --> 05:32.764
Who's in?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.366
Uh, thank you
so much, Carol,

05:34.368 --> 05:36.601
but we found a
couple of chowders

05:36.603 --> 05:38.437
that are only two
years out of date,

05:38.439 --> 05:40.605
so I think we're gonna
take our chances with that.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.707
Yeah, Carol,
I'm gonna pass, too.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.009
I'm not feeling very hungry.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.511
I think I'm gonna pass
as well, Care Bear.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.180
Uh, save me a
plate, though.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.183
Well, what do you want--
breast, wing, thigh, face?

05:51.185 --> 05:53.352
Chef's choice.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.721
Count me in, Carol.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.489
And I'm okay
with whatever you have.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.624
God.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.959
Erica, wait.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.862
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
I cut my finger.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.497
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Oh, geez, that's a gusher.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.965
Carol, get some paper towels.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.334
Sorry, I get nauseous

06:09.336 --> 06:10.969
on the sight on blood.
(gags)

06:10.971 --> 06:13.805
That's proof, oh!
Gail, you're our medical expert.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.207
What do we do here?

06:15.209 --> 06:16.908
Medical expert, hardly.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.977
Well, you knew
all that CPR mumbo jumbo.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.246
Well, that doesn't mean
I know anything about cuts.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.514
(retches)
Don't say cuts.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.316
Anything can set me off.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.151
You guys, it's fine.
It's gonna be fine.
No.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.686
No, you know what?
That looks really bad.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.020
I-I'm gonna go get
that first aid book.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.255
(gags)

06:31.891 --> 06:33.959
(motor humming)

06:36.429 --> 06:38.730
TANDY:
Pretty cool house, huh?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.165
(gasping)

06:40.167 --> 06:42.901
(gasps)
Huh?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.336
How you doing, Todd?

06:44.338 --> 06:46.571
Uh, good. How-how are you?

06:46.573 --> 06:48.740
Light switch on...

06:48.742 --> 06:50.342
off.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.177
On, off.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.612
It works!

06:53.614 --> 06:57.282
Probably 'cause
the solar power, I guess.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.784
Hmm.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.520
Wonder what else
could be working in here?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.789
What else

07:03.791 --> 07:06.291
could be

07:06.293 --> 07:08.293
working?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.961
Yeah, you know,
I don't, I don't really know...

07:09.963 --> 07:11.296
You hear that?

07:11.298 --> 07:12.764
It's like a hum?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.766
Where's that coming from?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.369
I-I-I don't know, Tandy.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.104
'Cause it sounds like

07:19.106 --> 07:22.040
it's coming from right

07:22.042 --> 07:24.109
over here.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.414
What's in the freezer,
Todd?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.049
Nothing, really.
It's just...

07:31.051 --> 07:32.951
I already know, Todd.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.120
It's the same thing

07:35.122 --> 07:38.123
that's in your stomach
right now.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.036
Bacon.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.473
42 packages of bacon
to be exact.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.308
I counted them all yesterday

07:56.310 --> 07:57.943
when I caught you
sneaking out of here.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.111
How many were in there
when you found it?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.980
I'm guessing
you're gonna say 42,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.748
but I'd be willing to bet
that the number

08:03.750 --> 08:07.185
was just a little bit higher,
now, wasn't it, Todd?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.287
Wasn't it?!

08:09.289 --> 08:10.489
Yes, Tandy!

08:10.491 --> 08:11.957
There were more.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.959
Now, I wonder...

08:13.961 --> 08:15.994
did you ask the group
if they wanted some bacon?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.662
Huh?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.264
'Cause they're
all eating bugs, man.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.999
Bugs!

08:21.001 --> 08:22.868
And you don't think
they'd want to hear about this?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.669
'Cause I think they would.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.305
Maybe somebody should
go tell them about it.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.574
No!
Tandy, please God! No!

08:36.482 --> 08:38.216
Anything you want to say to me

08:38.218 --> 08:39.851
before I go down there
and tell them?

08:39.853 --> 08:41.786
Yes, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Tandy.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.355
I'm really, really sorry, man.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.757
'Cause I have something
I want to say to you.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.460
Start cooking.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.895
(quiet laugh)

08:49.897 --> 08:51.029
(chuckles)

08:51.031 --> 08:53.265
(sizzling)

08:56.035 --> 08:58.103
(choral music playing)

09:07.246 --> 09:08.747
I don't need stitches.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.049
I can see yellow
fatty tissue.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.084
(gags)
Which means that
that cut will not

09:13.086 --> 09:16.087
close on its own, which
means you do need stitches.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.223
Okay, well, which of you bozos
is gonna do that?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.425
I would like to take
a strike at it.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.361
Gail, are you drunk?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.564
I have been drinking,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.666
but I am not drunk.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.570
(moans)

09:31.572 --> 09:33.638
Mmm.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.610
So, how are things going
with you and Melissa?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.612
Hey, don't, okay?

09:40.614 --> 09:42.948
Don't bring her up.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.516
Feeling kind of guilty?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.284
No, Tandy,
I feel great about it.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.253
You know, I love hiding
secrets from my lover.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.423
I'm on top
of the frigging world about it.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.892
You know, I've been
thinking a lot

09:53.894 --> 09:56.728
about the, the stuff that
I did to you back in Tucson.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.597
And I just want
to say I'm sorry...

09:58.599 --> 10:00.398
Look, just shut up
and eat, okay?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.568
The only reason you're here
is so you can't blackmail me.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.571
Todd, I... I would
never blackmail you.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.441
I mean, we're bros.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.109
Tandy, we're not bros.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.678
This is just about the bacon.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.949
Just about the bacon.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.018
Got it.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.396
Hey, lady!

10:31.398 --> 10:32.497
How's your hand?

10:33.232 --> 10:34.633
(retches)

10:34.635 --> 10:35.867
Never mind.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.239
Okay, so I need some help
with my outfit.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.842
Phil has been
extra flirty with me,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.845
and I'm getting the sense
that it's upsetting Erica.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.279
Oh, you think?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.648
I mean, I've only
seen her give you

10:49.650 --> 10:50.982
like a hundred eye rolls.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.317
Thank you. I know.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.319
It's like,
"Hi. Would you like

10:54.321 --> 10:56.488
some butter
with your eye rolls?"

10:56.490 --> 10:58.823
I know. It's like, "Don't
fill up on eye rolls, Erica.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.858
Save room for dinner."

10:59.860 --> 11:01.226
(laughing)

11:01.861 --> 11:04.262
We have fun.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.532
But seriously, I'm not even
trying to attract Phil.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.502
I think I just need
to tamp down my essence,

11:10.504 --> 11:14.939
find something a little more,
I don't know, boring.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.075
Oh, like what you have on.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.012
I juiced up some crickets
for you guys.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.181
Mmm.
It tastes so good.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.116
Just like chicken juice.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.452
And there's one for everybody.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.522
M'lady. My man.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.692
Oh, thank you, Tandy.
Just pass 'em on down.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.061
(deep voice):
And there's one for you, Phil.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.029
You can just get it yourself.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.065
Okay. Thank you.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.800
(chuckles)

11:43.669 --> 11:45.370
Wow, this is fantastic.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.406
You're right-- it tastes
just like cold chicken broth.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.275
So good. Mmm.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.747
(sighs)

11:55.749 --> 11:57.348
Thanks for the juice,
Carol, but I'm...

11:57.350 --> 11:59.317
you know, I'm not...
not feeling super hungry today.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.819
Are you okay? You
haven't eaten in days.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.387
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.223
I just think I'm maybe
coming down with something.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.491
Oh, I can go to the
pharmacy and get you...

12:06.493 --> 12:08.159
I'm-I'm fine!
(laughs) You know?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.028
I just think I'm coming
down with something.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.896
(clears throat)
I'm gonna go for a walk.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.266
You know, truth be told,
I'm feeling the same way.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.335
Think I might be coming
down with whatever he has.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.971
Uh, we compared symptoms
earlier. It checks out.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.744
Oh, Melissa,
look at your finger.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.212
(gasps) Oh, God.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.347
Girl, you're not
bleeding out on my watch.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.450
You need stitches, and I will
not take no for an answer.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.452
Okay, fine.
(squeals)

12:34.454 --> 12:36.321
Okay.
I'm gonna go get my gear.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.858
Erica.

12:39.860 --> 12:40.925

12:40.927 --> 12:42.260
We need to talk.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.862
Do we, Carol?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.597
You've been eye-rolling me
like a googly doll

12:45.599 --> 12:47.132
since I got here.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.100
You don't think I see
all the flirting

12:49.102 --> 12:50.602
you've been doing with Phil?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.837
If anything,
I'm doing the opposite.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.640
I mean, for Pete Sampras,

12:55.642 --> 12:58.109
look at this dumb outfit
I borrowed from Melissa.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.878
I don't know,
you look fine to me.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.814
This needs, like,
a pineapple on it or a giraffe

13:02.816 --> 13:04.949
or children sliding
down a rainbow.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.885
I mean, this is not me.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.119
But I'm wearing it.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.654
And you know why?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.156
'Cause I care about you.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.957

to do something different

Wouldn't it be nice

13:20.500 --> 13:22.667
gets broken up with,
she blames the other girl.

blame for what I did.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.407
I found all this bacon,

19:03.409 --> 19:05.409

19:12.986 --> 19:14.919
trustworthiest,
straight-shootinest,

19:14.921 --> 19:17.155
selflessest son of a
gun I've ever known.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.789
He immediately said,

19:18.791 --> 19:20.658
"Hey, let's go share this
with the community."

19:20.660 --> 19:22.760

and we'll go down together."

wrong, sir. Never!"

19:27.700 --> 19:29.367

you guys know

19:29.369 --> 19:31.002
I do that from time to time.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.505
Then he took the gun, and
he put it in his mouth

19:34.507 --> 19:38.142

'cause I would rather be dead

19:38.144 --> 19:41.279

with the people I love."

19:41.281 --> 19:43.114

19:43.116 --> 19:45.816
he calmly walked over, picked
up the three remaining bacons,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.953
marched straight out the door
and delivered them to you guys,

19:48.955 --> 19:50.354

20:14.480 --> 20:16.981
he had a little bit,
too, but...

20:16.983 --> 20:18.382
this was all me.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.551
(breaking down):
Surprise, surprise.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.720
The fat guy ate the bacon.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.555
(crying):
And I'm so sorry.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.524
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

20:26.526 --> 20:28.726
because I lied to all of you,

20:28.728 --> 20:31.829
and I lied to the woman
that I love.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.231
And I'll take
whatever punishment

20:33.233 --> 20:34.732
you guys think is fair.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.400
I will.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.469
Because I've been bad.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.739
(fake crying):
Nice try, Todd.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.208
And it moves me that
you tried to stick up

20:44.210 --> 20:46.444
for me like that,
but, guys, it was me!

20:46.446 --> 20:48.079
Can it, Tandy.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.680
Guys, who you
gonna believe?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.616
Him or me?

20:54.786 --> 20:56.687
Hey, Tandy.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.924
Thanks, man.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.760
You're welcome.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.964
But look, I know it was
just about the bacon, so...

21:06.966 --> 21:08.799
No.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.835
No, it wasn't.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.305
Thanks, bud.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.606
Fist bump?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.979
Bump. (chuckles)

21:52.010 --> 21:53.411
CHILDREN:
<i>Uncle Stinky.</i>

21:53.413 --> 21:55.012
(horn honking)
