WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:04.605
My first time?

00:09.577 --> 00:12.246
Dumpster in an alley.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.714
Near 59th.

00:13.747 --> 00:17.051
It was filled
with cardboard boxes

00:17.085 --> 00:19.087
and tissue paper.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.323
(sighs)

00:22.356 --> 00:24.158
One match and...

00:24.192 --> 00:27.361
the fire was raging
in under a minute.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.270
WOMAN:
How did that
make you feel?

00:36.304 --> 00:39.140
Safe.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.775
Like nothing or nobody
could hurt me.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.112
I made those flames dance.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.147
I was in control.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.252
After that,
there was no going back.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.657
I was never
going to be scared again.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.550
(bell dings)

01:24.585 --> 01:26.086
(both giggling)

01:32.526 --> 01:34.862
(bell dings)

01:55.216 --> 01:56.784
Oh, come on.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.553
Hello?

01:59.587 --> 02:01.222
Is there anybody out there?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.590
Hello?

02:04.225 --> 02:06.394
(gas hissing)

02:24.612 --> 02:26.747
(gasping)

02:26.780 --> 02:28.349
Help!

02:28.382 --> 02:29.583
Somebody, please!

02:29.617 --> 02:32.586
(screaming)

02:33.887 --> 02:35.756
Help!

02:35.789 --> 02:37.891
Aah! Help me.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.495
(screaming)

02:43.697 --> 02:46.267
Somebody help me!

02:47.435 --> 02:48.936
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:48.969 --> 02:50.904
(siren wails)

03:02.450 --> 03:05.286
(indistinct chatter)

03:27.408 --> 03:29.610
DANVILLE:
Oh, my God, Mac.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.721
Looks like those pipes
were the source of the heat.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.824
Someone turned this elevator
into a boiler.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.695
TAYLOR:
Somebody turned this elevator
into a torture chamber.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.663
Our vic's name is Rita Lowman.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.399
According to one of her
neighbors, she freelanced

03:51.432 --> 03:52.833
a couple times a month
as a private nurse.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.969
Found this I.D. badge in her
apartment and not much else.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.671
And an old acquaintance.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.440
Security cam outside
the service entrance

03:59.473 --> 04:01.041
captured an unscheduled visit

04:01.074 --> 04:03.844
by the elevator repairman
early this morning.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.879
TAYLOR:
Leonard Brooks.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.789
Door's clear, no trip wires.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.869
(knock on door)

04:28.902 --> 04:31.805
NYPD! Brooks, open up!

04:35.976 --> 04:38.011
Go, go, go.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.983
We're good.
Bathroom's clear, sir.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.352
It's all clean.
It's all clear.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.486
FLACK:
Looks like he cleared

04:45.519 --> 04:46.554
out of here in a hurry.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.821
Notify every roll call

04:47.855 --> 04:49.022
and media outlet in the city.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.491
I want Brooks caught now.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.660
What's his endgame here, Mac?

04:54.061 --> 04:56.397
Whatever it is,

04:56.430 --> 04:59.933
Leonard Brooks
had 15 long years to plan it.

05:25.959 --> 05:30.398
* Out here in the fields

05:30.431 --> 05:34.368
* I fight for my meals

05:34.402 --> 05:38.872
* I get my back into my living

05:41.409 --> 05:43.511
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.655
Train stations,
port authority and airports

05:54.688 --> 05:57.691
are all covered, and units
are circulating Brooks's mug.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.693
Anything from his P.O.?
Hasn't heard
from him in days.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.062
Turns out Brooks has
no known friends or associates,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.498
which doesn't shock me,
having met the man.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.899
He's independent
and self-reliant.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.435
Makes him even more
unpredictable.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.703
(phone rings)

06:12.940 --> 06:13.941
Answer it.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.008
Just say hello.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.013
Hello?

06:20.047 --> 06:22.616
It's for you, Detective.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.556
Taylor.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.925
Sorry about the lack
of hospitality, Detective.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.594
I wasn't expecting guests.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.663
Brooks.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.669
Press is wrong
about me, you know.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.970
Don't like being called
a monster?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.605
No, that part is accurate.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.475
I am a monster,
but please tell those reporters

06:47.508 --> 06:49.543
my victim
was anything but innocent.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.879
Just surrender
and tell them yourself.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.047
Gracious offer,
but I can't accept.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.182
Who was she, Leonard?

06:55.215 --> 06:57.485
Why'd you kill
Rita Lowman?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.019
I got to go now, Detective.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.855
There's still
more work to be done.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.491
Brooks.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.531
(car horn honks)

07:10.564 --> 07:11.665
(siren blares)

07:25.078 --> 07:28.148
* You can make it alone
if you try *

07:28.181 --> 07:31.885
* Till the beat come home,
I know you'll sing it *

07:31.919 --> 07:35.523
* You can make it alone
if you try *

07:35.556 --> 07:38.458
* They never see your fire
till you make it out *

07:39.527 --> 07:40.594
* Well, are you with them?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.763
* If not, let it go

07:42.796 --> 07:44.865
* You're either
going to rock the boat *

07:44.898 --> 07:46.934
* Or have what
they're handing out *

07:46.967 --> 07:48.636
* Now you're somewhere remote

07:48.669 --> 07:52.072
* They think you got
a wire broke *

07:52.105 --> 07:54.074
* But what you hatching up?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.976
* Something that you wrote

07:56.009 --> 07:58.946
* Is going to make
a good lifeboat *

07:58.979 --> 08:01.014
* Asylum for the torn

08:01.048 --> 08:02.716
* A rumbling below

08:02.750 --> 08:05.719
* Said if not now,
you'll never go *

08:05.753 --> 08:08.155
* So while we wait it out

08:08.188 --> 08:11.091
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:11.124 --> 08:14.662
* Till the beat come home,
I know you'll sing it *

08:14.695 --> 08:18.165
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:18.198 --> 08:22.269
* They never see your fire
till you make it out *

08:22.302 --> 08:25.706
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:25.739 --> 08:28.576
* Till the beat come home,
I know you'll sing it *

08:28.609 --> 08:32.011
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:32.044 --> 08:35.883
* They never see your fire
till you make it out *

08:35.916 --> 08:38.686
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:38.719 --> 08:41.989
* Till the beat come home,
I know you'll sing it *

08:42.022 --> 08:45.225
* You can make it alone
if you try *

08:45.258 --> 08:49.563
* They never see your fire
till you make it out. *

08:51.699 --> 08:53.667
Fascinating.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.769
What is?

08:55.803 --> 09:00.774
Well, in spite of the severe
external tissue damage,

09:00.808 --> 09:04.211
internal structures were left
surprisingly unscathed.

09:04.244 --> 09:08.315
Based on the relative size
and condition of her organs,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.117
our vic was in
seemingly good health.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.986
Any external injuries sustained
prior to thermal necrosis?

09:13.020 --> 09:17.825
No indication of penetrating
wounds or blunt force trauma.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.028
C.O.D is hyperthermia.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.131
Broiled, not burned.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.599
(gasping)

09:25.633 --> 09:27.601
SID:
The infrared radiation
from above

09:27.635 --> 09:29.603
was efficiently lethal.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.840
Not a single flame touched her.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.909
The stainless steel walls
kept the compartment insulated

09:35.943 --> 09:37.645
and the intense heat
contained.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.612
Yeah.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.280
It overwhelmed
her thermoregulatory system,

09:40.313 --> 09:42.950
causing her core body temp
to spike.

09:42.983 --> 09:46.386
She suffered
a debilitating drop in heart

09:46.419 --> 09:49.222
and respiratory rate,
followed by systemic

09:49.256 --> 09:52.159
and lethal organ failure.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.962
Her death was anything
but quick and painless.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.931
Hey, Sid, you see this?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.232
Yeah, looks like a

09:59.266 --> 10:01.669
12-step recovery pendant.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.779
HAWKES:
It's personalized.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.847
Hmm?

10:13.881 --> 10:16.784
"To Jen, with love."

10:16.817 --> 10:19.086
Vic's first name is Rita.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.688
So, who is Jen,

10:20.721 --> 10:23.724
and why is Rita Lowman
wearing her necklace?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.301
DANVILLE:
You know, it didn't
make any sense, Mac.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.436
For years, Leonard Brooks
has suffered

10:36.469 --> 10:38.839
from sudden impulse
control disorder,

10:38.872 --> 10:40.841
compelling him
to start fires,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.409
but he did it
to cause property damage,

10:42.442 --> 10:45.779
never to cause bodily harm
or to take a life.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.681
So, why does his M.O.
suddenly change?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.182
And in such an extreme fashion?

10:49.216 --> 10:53.053
Because, clearly, the relief
that he got from starting fires

10:53.086 --> 10:55.022
no longer had any value.

10:55.055 --> 10:58.058
So torture and murder
is his new drug of choice.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.760
And when his
emotional need shifted,

10:59.793 --> 11:01.995
he needed to find
another means to satisfy it.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.864
Why now?
This is a guy

11:03.897 --> 11:06.066
who spent a large portion
of his life in jail.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.000
And now that's he's out,

11:07.034 --> 11:10.804
those urges and sensations
are magnified.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.139
They're just overwhelming.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.141
Control may not even
be an option for him.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.777
How do we find him?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.211
We have to get
inside Brooks's head,

11:18.245 --> 11:20.280
figure out the origin
of his disease.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.483
If we can create a physiological
road map, if you will,

11:23.516 --> 11:25.753
then we can probably
fill in a lot of blanks

11:25.786 --> 11:29.289
and help us understand
why he targeted Rita Lowman.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.225
Brooks said there was still
more work to be done.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.028
There was something
in his voice, Jo.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.430
My fear is, if we
don't catch him soon,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.767
somebody else is going to die.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.111
(phone ringing)

11:54.481 --> 11:56.016
(grunting)

12:02.022 --> 12:05.392
(grunts)
(groans)

12:05.425 --> 12:06.927
Where do you think you're going?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.197
Get up!

12:10.230 --> 12:12.165
You're coming with us.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.135
Oh, oh, I got him.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.336
Impressive.

12:16.369 --> 12:20.107
Growing up with three older
brothers has its advantages.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.942
Can I help you with something?

12:21.975 --> 12:24.511
Yeah, I need a desk.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.948
Looks a little
something like that?

12:27.981 --> 12:29.549
Yeah, what are you
going to do with it?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.151
My job.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.357
Detective Jamie Lovato.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.827
I just got my transfer orders
from Narcotics.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.962
My cover was blown,
so now I work here.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.363
Welcome to Homicide.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.165
I'm Detective Flack.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.100
As far as your desk goes,

12:47.134 --> 12:49.402
the watch commander
handles bullpen real estate.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.478
FLACK:
Still no sign of Brooks.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.181
But he's got to crawl out
from under his rock eventually.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.116
We trace the call
he made to his apartment?

13:03.150 --> 13:04.885
He used a burner.
Dead end.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.887
What about our vic,
Rita Lowman?

13:06.920 --> 13:07.921
She was living
under an alias.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.256
Rita Lowman isn't her name.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.491
Checked every possible database
I could think of.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.894
Turns out there's no record
of that name before 2000.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.230
She was wearing a necklace
engraved with the name Jen.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.032
Well, whoever Jen is,
we know that she's been living

13:19.066 --> 13:21.034
off the grid for at least
the last 12 years.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
Only reason to do that
is if you're hiding

13:22.635 --> 13:23.971
from something or someone.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.572
Brooks?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.841
We need to identify her
to make a connection.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.242
Circulate her...

13:30.377 --> 13:33.947
The, uh... circulate...

13:35.382 --> 13:36.549
(sighs)

13:36.583 --> 13:38.118
Get her face across the wire.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.421
And, uh, maybe somebody
can tell us her real name.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.455
All right.

13:52.365 --> 13:56.169
So, where the hell are you,
and what are you thinking?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.182
(sirens blaring)

14:09.216 --> 14:11.218
(birds chirping)

14:26.666 --> 14:28.936
*

14:44.017 --> 14:47.320
(grunts)

14:50.623 --> 14:54.661
(groaning)

14:54.694 --> 14:55.929
WOMAN:
What's happening?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.998
Is he okay?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.438
MAN:
Can you hear me?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.374
Sir, are you okay?
Are you okay, sir?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.009
Check if he's breathing.
Step back.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.519
Jimmy Clark, age 45.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.289
Collapsed in the park
earlier today.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.958
EMTs treated him
for a myocardial infarction.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.626
Their efforts
were clearly unsuccessful.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.229
This wasn't a heart attack.
No.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.164
It was efficiently planned

15:31.198 --> 15:33.300
and deliberately induced
hypovolemic shock.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.702
C.O.D. is severe blood

15:35.735 --> 15:38.371
and fluid loss
as an acute result

15:38.405 --> 15:43.110
of being burned alive
from the inside out.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.746
Precision
and intelligence behind it

15:46.779 --> 15:49.082
fits the M.O.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.051
Leonard Brooks did this.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.089
Burn damage is
geographical.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.625
Trajectory follows
the esophageal tract

15:58.658 --> 16:00.460
down to the stomach.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.430
Which is why chemical ingestion
was my initial hypothesis.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.498
That's consistent
with the contact burns,

16:05.532 --> 16:08.235
blisters
and tissue perforations.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.637
But not the considerable
thermal flash damage

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
to the gastric lining.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.244
Whatever he swallowed,

16:17.277 --> 16:21.314
it literally ignited a fire
inside his stomach.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.150
So what could cause that?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.387
(siren wailing past)

16:27.420 --> 16:30.590
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

16:30.623 --> 16:32.625
We just got this footage
from one of our

16:32.659 --> 16:35.128
Department surveillance cameras
in the park.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.597
TAYLOR:
Brooks stuck around
to see his plan in motion.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.433
Looks to me like the
bastard enjoyed the show.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.102
Pull footage from
every other security cam

16:42.135 --> 16:43.603
in a five-mile radius.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.205
I want to know
where he went

16:45.238 --> 16:46.606
when he walked
out of that park.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.740
All over it.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.542
Brooks's motive
is clearly personal.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.044
We have to establish
his connection

16:51.078 --> 16:52.279
to each of the victims.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.780
LOVATO:
I could tell you
how the vics

16:53.813 --> 16:55.415
are connected
to each other.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.150
Clark, vic number two?

16:57.184 --> 16:59.686
Eight months ago,
he got popped for assault.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.221
Pummeled some guy
in a bar.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.223
Guess who puts up
the 15 large to bail him out.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.759
Rita Lowman,
aka vic number one.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.595
Well, nobody fronts
that kind of cash for someone

17:08.627 --> 17:09.662
unless they're close.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.762
LOVATO:
That's what I thought,

17:10.797 --> 17:12.031
so I dug a little deeper.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.102
Clark's parents died in a car
crash when he was two years old.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.403
Had no other blood relatives,

17:16.435 --> 17:17.770
so he became
a ward of the state.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.838
So they're not related?

17:18.871 --> 17:21.108
Means their paths must have
crossed someplace else.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.644
Well, our vic number one
was a trained nurse.
Why does that matter?

17:24.676 --> 17:26.246
TAYLOR:
Child Protective Services

17:26.279 --> 17:28.581
employs nurses to provide
public health services

17:28.615 --> 17:30.550
to the children they oversee.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.519
Exactly.
FLACK:
So Clark could
have been

17:32.552 --> 17:34.187
one of her patients
when he was a kid.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.855
Subpoena his CPS records.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.157
Oh, they're
on their way already.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.193
I motivated the file clerk

17:40.227 --> 17:42.795
with a couple meatball subs
from Romeo's.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.864
If nothing else, Lovato, you got
damn good taste in Italian.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.766
TAYLOR:
Well, it won't be easy

17:46.799 --> 17:49.369
connecting the dots without
knowing Rita Lowman's real name.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.837
That's why Flack's
going to help me.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.673
And since I still
don't have a desk,

17:53.706 --> 17:55.175
looks like we'll be using yours.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.245
I like her.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.413
LOVATO:
Hey, sweetie.
Yeah.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.682
Whoa! How you been?
How are you?

18:02.715 --> 18:05.252
Join the club.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.155
My old man took me fishing
every Sunday morning.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.824
We would... ride the first bus
out to Coney Island,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.427
get to the pier
before anybody else.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.564
I would get a quarter
for every fish I caught,

18:17.597 --> 18:19.532
and then I would get
to spend the afternoon

18:19.566 --> 18:22.302
blowing it at Astroland.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.837
WOMAN: What's your
fondest memory of him?

18:26.506 --> 18:28.441
BROOKS:
I don't know. My ninth birthday.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.211
Ringling Brothers
was at the Garden, and...

18:34.714 --> 18:38.718
...my old man greased an usher
to sneak us backstage.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.720
He convinced a clown
to dress me up,

18:40.753 --> 18:43.523
put me in the show.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.924
There I was-- I was standing

18:44.957 --> 18:48.628
in front of
10,000 smiling faces,

18:48.661 --> 18:53.800
but my father, he had
the biggest smile of them all.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.237
I remember at that moment
thinking that I...

18:57.270 --> 18:59.939
was the luckiest kid
in the world

18:59.972 --> 19:02.742
'cause he was my dad.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.282
(muttering):
Zero zero three nine five two.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.753
Jo, uh, so Jane Fonda
just called.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.888
She said she wants
her workout tapes back.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.625
They are not Jane's.
They're Cher's.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.759
Cher had a workout video?

19:19.792 --> 19:20.893
Yes, she did.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.128
Seriously, what do you got here?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.432
Video recordings of Leonard
Brooks' prison therapy sessions.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.234
14 years' worth.
Why don't you

19:27.267 --> 19:28.701
call his shrink
and get the Cliff Notes?

19:28.735 --> 19:29.836
She passed away
last year,

19:29.869 --> 19:32.272
so I've got to rely
on all these tapes

19:32.305 --> 19:35.308
and her handwritten notes
to build a psych profile.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.210
Well, maybe I can
save you some time.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.478
People like Brooks spend

19:38.511 --> 19:42.315
their entire lives blaming other
people for all their problems.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.816
And I don't care
how rough he had it,

19:43.850 --> 19:44.984
there's nothing
on these tapes

19:45.017 --> 19:47.787
that are going to justify
what he did to those people.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.722
I'm just hoping there's
something on these tapes

19:49.756 --> 19:51.558
that tells us why he did it.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.626
All right.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.595
Let me ask you a question,
off the record.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.996
Shoot.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.398
You think Mac's okay?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.666
How do you mean?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.867
How do I mean?
I don't know exactly.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.403
It's just, you know, he's...

20:03.436 --> 20:04.671
he seems off.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.005
Well, a little off

20:06.038 --> 20:07.440
would be pretty damn good

20:07.474 --> 20:08.975
considering everything
he's been through.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.710
I mean, think about it.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.379
He suffered a
life-changing trauma,

20:12.412 --> 20:14.781
months of painful rehab.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.449
Yeah.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.717
Most people would have
reexamined everything,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.686
quit their job
and be sitting on a beach,

20:19.719 --> 20:22.722
but not Mac.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.558
Couldn't wait to pick up
exactly where he left off.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.827
I think it's a miracle
and a gift

20:27.860 --> 20:31.598
that the guy's the same old
hard-ass boss he's always been.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.701
I worry about him.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.436
Look at you.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.438
You're just an old softie.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.307
Don't worry.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.808
I'll keep an eye on Mac,
just in case.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.842
Thanks.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.312
Now, you get back
to your workout.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.755
You wanted to see me?

20:55.788 --> 20:59.058
It's so simple, Mac,
it's genius.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.060
Brooks used basic chemistry
to kill Jimmy Clark.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.863
Based on Sid's
ingestion theory,

21:03.896 --> 21:06.499
I looked at the uneaten portion
of our vic's lunch.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.001
Black forest turkey,
muenster on rye,

21:09.035 --> 21:10.837
bag of chips
and a bottle of water.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.605
I ran it all through the GC-MS.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.674
Get this.
The food was spiked.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.976
Well, not the food per se;
the condiment.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.811
Mayonnaise is typically

21:18.845 --> 21:22.014
an emulsion of egg yolk,
oil and vinegar.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.984
This stuff had a little
something extra thrown in.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.653
Cesium.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.321
Which is easy to get

21:28.355 --> 21:30.657
from any laboratory
supply house or online.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.760
Right, so here's
what happened, okay?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.863
Our vic takes a bite

21:36.896 --> 21:38.097
of his sandwich.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.032
It tastes funny,
so what's his natural reaction?

21:40.066 --> 21:41.768
To wash it down with water.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.337
Right.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.973
Cesium is an alkali metal.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.708
When mixed with H2O,

21:48.741 --> 21:51.043
the hydrogen bonds
break down into gas,

21:51.077 --> 21:52.912
generating intense heat.

21:52.945 --> 21:53.946
The more Clark drank,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.715
the more severely he was burned.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.884
And as if that
weren't bad enough,

21:57.917 --> 21:59.819
as the cesium made its way

21:59.852 --> 22:01.754
down the GI tract
into the stomach,

22:01.788 --> 22:03.690
it was introduced
to digestive fluids.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.525
Hydrochloric acid.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.359
(popping)

22:06.393 --> 22:09.396
Creating a violent
exothermic reaction.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.697
The fire burned inside of him

22:10.730 --> 22:11.931
until all the fuel
was exhausted.

22:11.964 --> 22:15.101
How could Brooks ensure that
Clark would eat the sandwich?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.904
The wrapper came
from a deli on 34th Street.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.540
It's across the street
from Clark's apartment.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.375
The deli owner told me
that Clark was a regular,

22:22.409 --> 22:23.876
that he got his sandwich there
every single day.

22:23.910 --> 22:27.079
He also told me that he hired
a new counter guy last week.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.381
Leonard Brooks.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.116
Physical description matches.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.485
But Brooks used the name
Phil Gordon.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.787
Brooks stalked Clark...

22:34.821 --> 22:37.657
studied and exploited
his routines.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.426
Flack put surveillance
in the deli

22:39.459 --> 22:41.694
just in case Brooks comes back.
He won't.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.963
He's already accomplished
what he set out to do.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.466
The question is,
what comes next?

22:48.468 --> 22:51.638
(sighs) I am never going to
bad-mouth computer files again.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.406
These CPS files
are killing me.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.707
This sucks.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.108
Are you always this whiny?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.744
Yes.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.914
So, how long did you work
undercover narcotics?

23:01.948 --> 23:03.783
Three and a half years.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.919
Why'd you request
the transfer to Homicide?

23:06.953 --> 23:09.489
Stuff happens.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.758
Care to elaborate?

23:11.791 --> 23:14.026
No.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.097
Whoa.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.600
Check this out.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.769
Look at the name.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.103
Jennifer Brooks.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.974
It says there that
Clark was her foster kid
starting at age 15,

23:28.007 --> 23:31.010
but her name is
Jennifer Brooks.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.679
Jennifer...

23:34.080 --> 23:36.182
HAWKES:
"To Jen, with love."

23:36.215 --> 23:37.517
Jen, Jennifer...

23:37.550 --> 23:39.886
That explains the name
on the pendant.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.988
FLACK:
That could be Rita Lowman.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.490
Son of a bitch.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.958
Brooks killed his own mother
and foster brother.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.496
(sirens wailing)

23:49.529 --> 23:51.931
DANVILLE:
Leonard Brooks was a happy,
well-adjusted kid,

23:51.964 --> 23:55.034
and then his dad dies two days
after his ninth birthday.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.969
Well, that's a tough
pill to swallow.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.238
Any indication
he acted out?
He never talked

23:59.271 --> 24:01.508
about it, and then his life
skips ahead three years

24:01.541 --> 24:02.775
to the time where he starts

24:02.809 --> 24:04.577
setting fires.
So, sometime

24:04.611 --> 24:06.579
between the ages
of nine and 12,

24:06.613 --> 24:08.080
Leonard Brooks
becomes a monster.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.116
HAWKES:
Dental records
confirm our first vic

24:10.149 --> 24:12.785
Rita Lowman was actually
Jennifer Brooks,

24:12.819 --> 24:15.588
Leonard's birth mother
and Jimmy Clark's foster mom.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.889
Clark lived
with Leonard

24:16.923 --> 24:18.858
and his mother
from 1980 to 1983.

24:18.891 --> 24:22.529
And she took Jimmy in right
after her husband passed away.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.497
HAWKES:
So why assume that
kind of responsibility

24:24.531 --> 24:27.066
at such a difficult time?
TAYLOR: Money may
have been tight.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.936
State's foster care stipend
may have helped make ends meet.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.070
So, we have Leonard,

24:31.103 --> 24:34.173
his mother
and his foster brother.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.943
God, something terrible
must've happened in that house

24:36.976 --> 24:38.945
for him to start setting fires

24:38.978 --> 24:41.080
and ultimately want them
both dead.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.115
He claims both his vics
are guilty.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.684
Of what?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.218
Well, unfortunately,
Brooks has killed

24:46.252 --> 24:48.688
everyone who was there
to tell us.
DANNY:
Not yet he hasn't.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.190
Clark wasn't Jennifer Brooks'
only foster child.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.291
There's another
little girl

24:52.324 --> 24:54.260
by the name
of Rachel Nelson.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.828
She'd be 39
years old now.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.997
We need to find her
before Brooks does.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.638
*
(siren wailing)

25:26.759 --> 25:27.994
(beeping)

25:32.865 --> 25:34.567
(dialing)

25:34.601 --> 25:36.102
DANNY:
Any luck

25:36.135 --> 25:37.570
locating Rachel Nelson?

25:37.604 --> 25:39.105
Rachel Nelson...

25:39.138 --> 25:40.740
Now Rachel Moore.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.209
Then... and now.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.177
Lives in upstate New York,
but currently resides at...

25:45.211 --> 25:47.313
Weddington Rehab Clinic
in Midtown for alcohol abuse.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.715
90 days, court order.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.216
I'm going to try to get the...

25:50.249 --> 25:53.019
clinic on the phone right now.
All right, good.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.721
(line ringing)
No one's answering.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.255
Something's got
to be wrong.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.758
Now, I'll notify Mac.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.628
(sirens wailing)

26:07.734 --> 26:09.902
(high-pitched whooshing)

26:16.976 --> 26:19.011
(siren wailing)
WOMAN: 911 dispatch.
What's your emergency?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.781
(coughing, panicked chatter)

26:23.049 --> 26:25.117
(sirens wailing)

26:27.987 --> 26:30.923
(camera shutter clicking)

26:40.099 --> 26:41.333
DANNY:
Yo, Doc.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.169
No sign of Rachel.
Hey.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.837
What do you got?

26:44.871 --> 26:47.239
It's a pretty lethal
cocktail of chemicals

26:47.273 --> 26:48.641
despite being outdoors.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.110
Ammonia and bleach?
Chemistry 101.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.945
So, there was never a fire?

26:52.979 --> 26:56.182
Just smoke. And vapors strong
enough to create chlorine gas.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.717
All right, so
he fills the...

26:57.750 --> 26:59.786
vents with smoke and fumes
so somebody pulls

26:59.819 --> 27:01.788
the fire alarm--
creates a diversion.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.690
Giving people a chance
to get out...

27:03.723 --> 27:04.991
In order to grab Rachel Moore.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.759
Easy escape in all the chaos.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.195
(sighs) So where'd
Brooks take her?

27:09.228 --> 27:12.331
Now, more importantly,
how long does she have to live?

27:15.167 --> 27:16.836
(brakes squeak)

27:16.869 --> 27:19.906
(whimpering, crying)

27:21.808 --> 27:24.210
(screaming)

27:29.415 --> 27:31.183
I don't know.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.352
Things are just...

27:33.385 --> 27:36.756
(sighing heavily):
I feel cloudy today.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.358
I'm just...

27:39.391 --> 27:43.229
I'm just trying to find a way
to sort it all out.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.698
WOMAN:
When was the last
time you slept?

27:45.732 --> 27:48.100
BROOKS:
I don't know.
Days ago, maybe more.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.136
I-I-I can't trust my mind.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.704
WOMAN:
Nightmares again?

27:51.738 --> 27:54.273
BROOKS (sighs):
Close my eyes and all I see

27:54.306 --> 27:56.475
are... are hunters.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.778
Angry and... and vicious,

27:58.811 --> 28:01.413
all with blood on their hands.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.249
It's my blood.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.251
WOMAN:
It's just a dream, Leonard.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.954
I spend so much time
in here thinking.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.456
Thinking, thinking, thinking.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.859
Can't forget anything.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.895
My past just plays on this loop.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.898
WOMAN: Well, the past
is why we're here.
No!

28:18.931 --> 28:20.733
We're here, Doc,
'cause I went back.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.168
'Cause I tried to save someone.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.437
(pounds table)
'Cause I did what no one
would do for me!

28:29.909 --> 28:33.746
I heard a story
when I was a kid about a...

28:33.780 --> 28:35.314
deer who got lost in the woods

28:35.347 --> 28:37.283
who tried to get back
to his castle--

28:37.316 --> 28:39.318
found himself being stalked.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.890
They wanted blood.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.759
To bring home the kill.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.328
That deer just hoped that
something or someone would...

28:49.361 --> 28:52.298
save it, protect it.

28:52.331 --> 28:55.902
And like that,
he becomes invisible.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.871
Unseen, unheard...

28:58.905 --> 29:00.907
unharmed.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.009
Vanished.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.345
WOMAN:
Is that what you
want, Leonard?

29:06.378 --> 29:08.180
To be invisible?

29:08.214 --> 29:12.051
Starting fires seems to be
in opposition to that want.
No.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.021
You never listen.
Can't you see?

29:15.054 --> 29:17.790
I control fire.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.325
No one's looking at me.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.260
All eyes are on the flames.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.063
And I did that-- me.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.465
Control fire.

29:26.498 --> 29:30.837
I can't do anything else,
but I know I can control that.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.406
How many of those
have you had?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.943
Uh... 200, one for every hour
of tape I've watched,

29:36.976 --> 29:39.211
but the good news is,
I think I found something.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.014
Leonard brutally murders
his mother, Jennifer Brooks,

29:42.048 --> 29:45.952
and yet, in 14 years of therapy,
he never mentions her once?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.553
That's strange.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.155
Well, given

29:49.188 --> 29:50.957
the possible history
of child abuse,

29:50.990 --> 29:52.591
he could've transferred
his feelings

29:52.624 --> 29:55.027
to something
or someone else...

29:55.061 --> 29:57.897
which is why he
doesn't mention her.
For years,

29:57.930 --> 29:59.365
Leonard suffered
from a recurring nightmare

29:59.398 --> 30:00.466
about being hunted.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.269
He references the story
over and over in these tapes.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.938
It's about a deer
and a castle.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.074
And the deer's being hunted,
but he's saved

30:08.107 --> 30:09.575
when something makes it
invisible.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.043
The story of Saint Aidan.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.879
So based on transference...

30:12.912 --> 30:16.182
Brooks's mother and foster
brother are the hunters...

30:16.215 --> 30:19.952
Leonard would consider
himself the deer-- the hunted.
And in that case,

30:19.986 --> 30:22.154
what part of the story
would Rachel play,

30:22.188 --> 30:23.489
and where's Leonard's castle?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.557
Hey, guys.
The trace I found on the roof

30:25.591 --> 30:28.861
came back
as silver nitrate ointment.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.163
Used to treat burns.
DANVILLE: Yeah, but
that you could find

30:31.197 --> 30:33.165
at any hospital, pharmacy,
doctor's office.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.001
But get this, the ointment

30:35.034 --> 30:36.936
was severely degraded.
Level of breakdown

30:36.969 --> 30:39.038
suggests it's
about ten years old.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.440
Also, the ammonia and bleach
were industrial.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.142
A brand called Superla.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.944
Checked it out-- company went
out of business about...

30:44.977 --> 30:47.046
Ten years ago?
You got it.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.949
Burn ointment.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.951
Ten years ago.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.421
Leonard's mother.

30:58.424 --> 31:01.460
Jennifer Brooks was a burn ward
nurse in three hospitals.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.895
Two are still open.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.564
The third has been abandoned
for ten years.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.199
Saint Aidan's.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.601
Saint Aidan's Hospital
is Leonard's castle.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.038
If Brooks is setting
fire to the past,

31:12.071 --> 31:15.307
there's a good chance
that's where he wants to end it.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.343
(whimpering)

31:20.079 --> 31:22.915
(crying)

31:22.949 --> 31:25.217
BROOKS:
It's payback
time, Rachel.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.025
(muffled talking)

31:33.059 --> 31:34.093
This smell familiar?

31:34.126 --> 31:37.029
Since canned heat is
the popular drink of choice

31:37.063 --> 31:40.066
for a desperate drunk like you,
it just felt appropriate.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.333
(muffled talking)

31:41.367 --> 31:42.534
Well...

31:42.568 --> 31:44.436
I learned that cocktail
from Mom.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.639
(crying)

31:59.385 --> 32:03.055
(crying in distance)

32:03.089 --> 32:06.125
(muffled talking)

32:06.158 --> 32:08.360
(sniffling, whimpering)

32:08.394 --> 32:11.730
Why didn't... why
didn't you...

32:11.763 --> 32:14.533
help me? You saw.

32:20.272 --> 32:24.110
Please, Mommy.
No! Not again.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.713
(thumping)
(crying):
Not again. Please...

32:27.746 --> 32:31.483
(crying):
I wanted to. Please,
Lenny, I'm sorry!

32:31.517 --> 32:33.352
I'm sorry.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.564
FLACK:
Hey, Mac, over here.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.205
Please, just...

32:53.239 --> 32:54.606
just stop.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.741
Stop wh-what?!

32:55.774 --> 32:57.976
Stop and... be your savior?!

33:04.450 --> 33:07.386
I was seven.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.623
What was I supposed to do?

33:11.657 --> 33:15.327
(whimpering)

33:15.361 --> 33:17.563
Lenny...

33:17.596 --> 33:20.699
The fence in the backyard,

33:20.732 --> 33:22.534
there was that one board.

33:22.568 --> 33:26.105
Seven over with the crack
at the top.

33:26.138 --> 33:29.041
BROOKS: Opened
into the Winchell's yard.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.209
They were just next door.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.543
You could have
squeezed through.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.512
You could have told them.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.681
I didn't know what to say.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.583
The truth.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.551
We could have stopped
it, all of it,

33:39.585 --> 33:41.520
us, together.

33:41.553 --> 33:45.457
Lenny, please,
just stop this.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.692
Just... (muffled screaming)

33:53.499 --> 33:55.501
It has to end, Rachel.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.670
Put the lighter out now.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.408
Well done, Detective,

34:02.441 --> 34:05.344
but I got to say I'm sorry
to see it come to this.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.278
Do it, Leonard.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.280
No. You shoot me,

34:08.313 --> 34:10.248
I'll ignite her
before that bullet hits.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.550
Just put it out.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.418
No one has to die here.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.121
Wrong! No one innocent
has to die!

34:17.556 --> 34:19.225
Killing Rachel

34:19.257 --> 34:21.427
because she didn't
come to the rescue

34:21.460 --> 34:23.262
won't make your demons
go away, Leonard.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.297
(screams)

34:27.132 --> 34:28.367
FLACK:
Turn over!

34:28.400 --> 34:29.768
(groaning)

34:29.801 --> 34:30.802
Stay right there!

34:30.835 --> 34:32.804
Don't move.
Do not move.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.841
Stay down.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.277
(panting)

34:38.310 --> 34:40.312
(sobbing)

34:45.150 --> 34:46.784
(coughs)

34:46.818 --> 34:48.520
(panting)

34:48.554 --> 34:50.556
There, it's all right.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.161
He's right.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.232
I should have done something.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.301
(sobbing)

35:04.603 --> 35:06.605
(sirens wailing)

35:09.708 --> 35:13.445
I spent years
replaying everything.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.681
My mother,

35:15.714 --> 35:17.916
the smell of cheap whiskey
on her breath,

35:17.949 --> 35:21.520
how hot that basement was.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.555
(thumping)

35:34.533 --> 35:36.835
I had to stop the memories,

35:36.868 --> 35:39.405
get control.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.839
First your mother,

35:40.872 --> 35:43.475
then your foster brother.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.544
He showed up
after your father passed.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.179
Right after the abuse started.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.481
You were expecting

35:49.515 --> 35:51.617
Jimmy to save you?

35:51.650 --> 35:54.853
He was just so big.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.389
He was like an adult.

35:57.423 --> 36:00.759
He looked like one of the guys
in the comic books,

36:00.792 --> 36:03.595
like some kind of superhero.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.431
But he wasn't a superhero.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.466
He beat you, too,
didn't he, Leonard?

36:07.499 --> 36:09.735
Afraid that if he didn't,

36:09.768 --> 36:11.903
he'd suffer the same fate.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.872
When I think about it, though,
Mother was smaller,

36:13.905 --> 36:17.709
yet it always hurt more
coming from her.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.745
(groaning)

36:23.282 --> 36:26.785
She used to take me to work

36:26.818 --> 36:28.720
when she didn't know
what else to do.

36:31.022 --> 36:35.561
I wanted nothing more
than to be loved by her.

36:35.594 --> 36:39.865
Just, like, an ounce
of the attention she gave them.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.338
TAYLOR:
So you hid in the chapel,

36:46.372 --> 36:48.274
guarded by the saints.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.542
BROOKS:
My own mother, (chuckles)

36:50.576 --> 36:51.710
she liked them,

36:51.743 --> 36:54.646
loved them more than me.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.482
All those fires,

36:56.515 --> 36:58.817
and the one that got you caught,
the one that put you away,

36:58.850 --> 37:01.987
is the one where you went back
in to save an innocent woman.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.691
You did the one thing
no one would do for you:

37:05.724 --> 37:07.626
come to the rescue.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.629
You know, it was always
only about the fire.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.931
Always.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.273
You think I chose
to be like this?

37:21.307 --> 37:23.942
It's the events in our life
that shape us,

37:23.975 --> 37:27.746
but it's our choices
that define us,

37:27.779 --> 37:31.617
and you made the wrong choice,
Leonard.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.328
(chuckles)
Well, it took you long enough.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.530
But thank you.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.635
You should know,
the guys got a pool going.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.570
Yeah?

37:51.603 --> 37:53.539
Let me guess:

37:53.572 --> 37:56.375
What will last longer,
me or the plant?

38:13.359 --> 38:15.627
(chuckles)

38:15.661 --> 38:17.596
WOMAN:
It's just a dream, Leonard.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.899
Starting fires seems to be
in opposition to that want.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.568
BROOKS:
Can't you see?

38:22.601 --> 38:24.102
I control fires.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.104
I close my eyes,
and all I see...

38:26.137 --> 38:28.340
Nobody can hurt me.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.608
All eyes are on the flames.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.711
I did that, me...

38:32.744 --> 38:33.979
My blood...

38:34.012 --> 38:35.714
Cloudy today...

38:35.747 --> 38:37.383
I made those flames dance.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.354
WOMAN:
You said starting fires

38:42.388 --> 38:43.855
was all about you

38:43.889 --> 38:46.892
being in control,
but is it really?

38:46.925 --> 38:48.560
I don't know.

38:48.594 --> 38:52.063
It's just something I feel.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.634
Something that...

38:55.667 --> 38:57.068
(sighs)

38:57.102 --> 38:59.538
It's hard to explain.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.640
Try.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.911
It's like that moment

39:05.944 --> 39:08.113
when you're a kid
and you first realize

39:08.146 --> 39:10.649
how powerful the ocean is.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.054
You step in,
and-and the water's calm,

39:16.087 --> 39:18.657
and you hold it in your hand,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.693
but it just slips
through your fingers.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.930
And you think,

39:24.963 --> 39:28.534
"Well, how strong could it
actually be?"

39:33.439 --> 39:35.407
Feeling bold,

39:35.441 --> 39:38.944
you wander out

39:38.977 --> 39:42.848
into the abyss.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.453
And by the time
you turn around,

39:47.486 --> 39:49.855
everyone you left on shore

39:49.888 --> 39:51.523
seems too far away to help.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.630
That's when it hits,
this wave,

39:58.664 --> 40:02.100
this massive current

40:02.133 --> 40:05.571
that pulls you in
and pushes you down,

40:05.604 --> 40:07.606
holds you there,

40:07.639 --> 40:10.842
pinned beneath something
so strong.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.177
It's like...

40:12.210 --> 40:14.913
something you can't control.

40:14.946 --> 40:18.650
All you can do is...
is hold on and fight,

40:18.684 --> 40:22.020
but then the more you fight,
the more weary you get,

40:22.053 --> 40:24.890
and your lungs burn
and your throat...

40:24.923 --> 40:28.760
throbs, so you...

40:28.794 --> 40:32.631
just let it overtake you.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.073
You feel this...

40:42.107 --> 40:44.543
force,

40:44.576 --> 40:48.246
seemingly benign,

40:48.279 --> 40:50.081
but it...

40:50.115 --> 40:53.519
can consume and destroy you.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.924
It's the thing
inside me, strong

40:58.957 --> 41:01.960
in ways that nobody can see

41:01.993 --> 41:04.863
or comprehend.

41:06.798 --> 41:10.736
This dark undertow
that I'm powerless to stop.

41:14.105 --> 41:17.543
I guess the fires
were really controlling me.
