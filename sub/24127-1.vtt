WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:06.875 --> 00:08.583
and he's fuzzy

00:08.583 --> 00:11.500
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.416 --> 00:27.833
we're so adventurous

00:27.833 --> 00:31.208
and again

00:31.208 --> 00:34.708
and there's nobody home

00:34.708 --> 00:38.125
to count on a friend

00:38.125 --> 00:41.625
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.583 --> 00:45.166
take me, please?

00:45.166 --> 00:48.583
I got to be there

00:50.458 --> 00:54.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:06.750 --> 01:09.250
WOMAN:
It's past your bed time,
Christopher Robin.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.375
Enough television
for tonight.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.208
CHRISTOPHER:
Aww, Mom.

01:13.208 --> 01:15.708
WOMAN: You know those kind of
movies give you nightmares.

01:15.708 --> 01:19.125
But Mom, that was way back
when I was a kid.

01:19.125 --> 01:21.583
WOMAN: Goodnight, darling.
Sweet dreams.

01:21.583 --> 01:24.125
And don't let me see your head
leave that pillow.

01:31.708 --> 01:34.875
She said for my head
not to leave the pillow.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.708
But she never said
anything about

01:36.708 --> 01:38.625
the pillow leaving the bed.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.125
Hello,
Christopher Robin.

01:58.125 --> 02:00.625
I see you do that
the way I do,

02:00.625 --> 02:03.083
the hard way.

02:03.083 --> 02:06.458
Hello, Pooh, Piglet.
What are you doing up?

02:06.458 --> 02:09.000
Well, my tummy was rumbly,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.708
so it came over to look for
something sweet.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.833
I'm just here to
keep it company.

02:15.833 --> 02:19.000
And Piglet's just here
to keep me company.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.875
Uh, Christopher Robin,

02:20.875 --> 02:22.625
n-not that it doesn't
look very nice,

02:22.625 --> 02:24.875
why do you have a pillow
on your head?

02:24.875 --> 02:28.125
Uh, because I need it
to watch TV.

02:32.208 --> 02:36.000
You're right.
I can see the TV
very clearly.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.250
Hey, Piglet,
Christopher Robin.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.875
Anybody seen Pooh Boy?
Thought I heard him.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.583
You did, Tigger.
And I'm here...

02:43.583 --> 02:44.875
under you.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.083
So, what's on?

02:49.083 --> 02:50.958
-Hey, that looks--
-Hey, look at this.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.583
Uh, it's gone.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.583
-I've always been fond of--
-

02:55.583 --> 02:57.583
TIGGER: Nah,
this is better.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.083
Perhaps we could watch a show
that lasts a little longer.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.875
TIGGER:
How about this?

03:01.875 --> 03:04.291
-CHRISTOPHER:
There goes another one.
-Wait. This looks great.

03:04.291 --> 03:07.500
Nah. I saw it before,
about three seconds ago.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.750
-

03:11.291 --> 03:13.625
Ahh, my favorite.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.083
Ahh, there.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.416
Just what I wanted to see.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.583
Oh, wonderful, Tigger.

03:25.583 --> 03:29.083
But it did seem to go by
rather quickly.

03:30.875 --> 03:34.083
It went by quickly
because we all fell asleep.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.333
Hey, look what's on.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.250
A nice spine tickling
slusher film.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.166
A slusher film?

03:41.166 --> 03:42.625
Yeah, you know.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.458
One of them films where
the guy boogedy-boogedys ya,

03:45.458 --> 03:47.833
then hits you
with a snowball.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.875
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

03:49.875 --> 03:51.583
Couldn't we watch something
a little nicer,

03:51.583 --> 03:53.458
like the potato growing show?

03:53.458 --> 03:55.166
It's my favorite program.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.166
No, a slusher film
sounds great.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.500
"The slusher who
slushed everyone,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.750
"and then went back to
slush 'em again."

04:02.750 --> 04:03.875
Woo! What a title.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.750
Piglet, why are you
hiding under the couch?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.000
Well, Pooh, it's where I can
best watch the movie

04:12.000 --> 04:13.291
without having to see it.

04:13.291 --> 04:16.458
Say, what kind of
a slusher film is this?

04:16.458 --> 04:17.958
Look, he's only holding
a butter knife.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.166
-A b-b-butter knife?

04:20.166 --> 04:22.958
Oh, d-d-dear.
The poor butter.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.000
Hello, kids.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.875
Do you suffer from
late night hunger pangs?

04:28.875 --> 04:31.708
Would you like something
special to eat?

04:31.708 --> 04:33.958
How about
a Chummy Cheese Pizza?

04:33.958 --> 04:37.208
Yes, yes, yes.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.833
Oh, bother.

04:39.833 --> 04:42.000
How shall I ever get
a pizza now?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.500
Just call 555-4051,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.583
and one will be sent
right over to you.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.166
Sounds good.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.166
What kind
do you want to get?

04:49.166 --> 04:50.833
One with lots of honey.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.458
-Hello?

04:53.458 --> 04:55.250
I'd like to order a pizza.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.333
I'd like a very small one,
please.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.833
Just one slice,
no cheese, no crust.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.875
Nah, make it a big one,
with "anchokies,"

05:02.875 --> 05:04.875
whatever they are.
No, wait, two big ones.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.250
-No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
-CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.083
-That's right.
-Three, four, five!

05:08.083 --> 05:11.208
-Delivery to 100, uh--
Two, uh-- three--
-TIGGER: No wait, two--

05:11.208 --> 05:12.958
-TIGGER: Wait, wait, wait,
wait wait, three, four--
-600 Acre Road.

05:12.958 --> 05:15.708
Boy, Tigger, I could barely
hear myself think.

05:15.708 --> 05:18.625
Uh, 600 Acre Road?

05:18.625 --> 05:20.125
Christopher Robin,

05:20.125 --> 05:21.875
isn't that the address of
the house next door?

05:21.875 --> 05:24.708
I didn't know we
lived next door.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.291
Perhaps we should
hurry over,

05:26.291 --> 05:28.375
so that the pizza
won't be lonely.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.375
I'd better call back.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.708
Hi. About the pizza
I ordered.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.458
Who is this?

05:34.458 --> 05:36.750
What do you want?
You woke me up for a pizza?

05:36.750 --> 05:38.458
The nerve of that guy

05:38.458 --> 05:40.583
thinkin' he can talk to us
and get away with it.

05:40.583 --> 05:44.416
Hello? Hello?
Olly-olly-oxenfree.

05:44.416 --> 05:47.291
-You've had it, pal,
you're toast.

05:47.291 --> 05:51.458
Ooh, I'm so scared
my stripes is shakin'.

05:51.458 --> 05:54.125
What ya gonna do?
You don't even know
where we live.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.208
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Boy, what a dummy.

05:56.208 --> 05:59.458
Now, if you knew we was at
100 Acre Road,

05:59.458 --> 06:01.833
-Maybe you could do something.
-CHRISTOPHER: Tigger!

06:01.833 --> 06:04.708
Oh, Tigger.
Now you've really done it.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.833
Well, TTFN.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.416
CHRISTOPHER:
But what if he's outside?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.750
There.
Now we'll be safe.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.583
CHRISTOPHER:
Yeah. Unless, of course,

06:25.583 --> 06:27.750
the slusher's
already in here,

06:27.750 --> 06:30.416
hiding under the bed
or in the closet.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.208
I believe that perhaps

06:38.208 --> 06:40.375
this is the perfect place
to hide.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.583
For if I can't see
the slusher,

06:42.583 --> 06:46.458
then the slusher
can't see me. I think.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.708
Don't be afraid,
don't be afraid.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.125
-Don't be afraid.
-

06:50.125 --> 06:51.291
Shh!

06:51.291 --> 06:53.291
Be afraid,
be afraid, be--

06:53.291 --> 06:54.458
Yahh!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.125
Yahh!

07:02.458 --> 07:04.000
Gotta keep your eyes peeled

07:04.000 --> 07:06.458
so as not to be snucked up on
by the slusher.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.708
-Yahh!
-It's the slusher!

07:09.708 --> 07:12.458
-He's got me!
-PIGLET: Yahh!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.875
-

07:16.875 --> 07:19.000
Woo-woo-woo!

07:19.000 --> 07:21.708
Must have given
that old slusher the slip.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.875
-Mm, you don't say.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.833
The little guy's always had
a way with words.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.125
Hurry. It's up to us.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.000
We got the slusher here.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We gotta come up with a plan
to get rid of him.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Right! Whaddaya say we
blow the whole house up?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.458
That'll get rid of
the old slusher
once and for all.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.625
No. I thought of
something better.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.833
A surprise trap that
the slusher will never forget.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.416
Okay. Everyone understand
the plan?

07:55.416 --> 07:59.958
Yes. But when do we yell
"surprise"?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.750
Boy, is that slusher
in for it. Hoo-hoo!

08:31.750 --> 08:34.291
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
This is gonna be great!

08:34.291 --> 08:36.708
Uh-oh.

08:36.708 --> 08:38.500
-Ah-hoo! Woo!

08:38.500 --> 08:40.416
Oh! Ooh-ooh!
Yahoo-hoo!

08:49.083 --> 08:51.875
There.
Now all we need is

08:51.875 --> 08:54.416
someone to lure the slusher
to its doom.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.500
Someone with
a spine of steel.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.000
Someone who doesn't know
the meaning of fear.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.458
Someone so brave,
he won't budge

09:01.458 --> 09:03.750
even if his life
is in danger.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.125
Which it will be.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.708
-A volunteer?

09:08.708 --> 09:12.750
Oh, Piglet.
How brave of you.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.458
He sure is.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.625
Now, remember,
Piglet old pal,

09:16.625 --> 09:18.458
don't move no matter what.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.000
This is very brave,
Piglet.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.708
Look at him,
chompin' at the bit.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.208
Whoops!
I forgot something.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.416
What are the hotdogs for,
Tigger?

09:29.416 --> 09:31.375
I saw it in a movie once.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.166
It helps attract
wild animals and slushers.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.875
Once the slusher
goes for the bait,

09:35.875 --> 09:37.375
we got him!

09:37.375 --> 09:40.291
Unless, of course,
a lion gets Piglet first.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.958
-Tigger!
-Well, it might.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.500
-Shh.
-TIGGER: Shh yourself.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.583
POOH: But I am shushing.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.583
-TIGGER: Get off my foot.
-Shh!

09:52.625 --> 09:56.875
Must be the slusher
reflexin' his muscles.

09:56.875 --> 10:00.166
Oh, my.
It's him.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.833
That's funny.
It's sounds like
there's two of 'em.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.500
I hear two sets of feet.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.000
-Hey.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.708
What's Piglet doing in
the middle of the room,

10:11.708 --> 10:13.250
in the dark?

10:13.250 --> 10:16.166
-Hello.
-

10:16.166 --> 10:19.000
I said, hello.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.291
P-P-P-Pooh!

10:22.625 --> 10:24.625
Don't like
the sound of that.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.625
-

10:26.625 --> 10:28.708
-We got him!
-We-- Ooh!

10:28.708 --> 10:30.875
-He's got us!
-

10:30.875 --> 10:33.875
Why, welcome back, Piglet.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.875
Yahh!

10:36.875 --> 10:38.250
Oh, bother.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.500
ALL: The slusher!
The slusher!

10:41.500 --> 10:44.416
Slusher?

10:48.416 --> 10:52.333
Always knew this would be
the way I'd go.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.208
The slusher!

10:59.125 --> 11:01.500
Stop, you slusher,
or I'll let ya have it!

11:01.500 --> 11:04.250
See? Uh-oh.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.375
Quick! Follow me.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.875
Uh-oh, again.

11:13.875 --> 11:17.875
-POOH: Surprise.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.708
-Look.
-POOH: It's Eeyore.

11:23.708 --> 11:26.291
He's not a slusher.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.708
You sure, Pooh boy?

11:27.708 --> 11:30.958
Could be a slusher
disguised as an Eeyore.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.833
Believe me,

11:32.833 --> 11:36.458
only an Eeyore
could feel like I do.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.708
Especially this Eeyore.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.375
PIGLET: Oh, then we weren't
running from anything.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.250
And nothing was running at us.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.416
Something's out there.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.583
There seems to be
someone knocking on

11:52.583 --> 11:54.125
the next door door.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.750
-Oh, m-m-my.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.458
And he's carrying some boxes.

11:59.458 --> 12:02.458
No doubt about it.
He must be the slusher.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.750
But what are
the boxes for, Tigger?

12:04.750 --> 12:08.750
Probably where he keeps his--
gasp-- slushes.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.125
CHRISTOPHER: Yep,
there's someone out there,
all right.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.708
Hmm. The slusher must have
gotten the wrong house.

12:19.708 --> 12:25.000
Yoo-hoo! Slusher!
We're over here.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.750
What do you think
you're doing, Pooh boy?

12:28.750 --> 12:30.833
I don't know. What?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.625
Christopher Robin,

12:32.625 --> 12:34.750
don't you think this is a
very good time to tell someone

12:34.750 --> 12:38.833
that there's a horrible,
awful slusher running amok,
maybe?

12:38.833 --> 12:42.125
No, this is our home.
Our neighborhood.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.458
-Our fight!
-Our funeral.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.333
We can't just let him
walk in here

12:46.333 --> 12:48.333
and slush our family
and friends.

12:48.333 --> 12:52.458
We're gonna stop that slusher
if it's the last thing we do.

12:52.458 --> 12:54.833
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.833
Come on. We've got
a slusher to un-slush.

13:16.416 --> 13:20.000
Wonder what we'll find
on the other side.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.875
My worst fear is that
I'm about to come face to face

13:22.875 --> 13:24.500
with my worst fear.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.708
Ah, there's probably
nothin' back there

13:26.708 --> 13:28.833
but your average backyard.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.458
Filled with slushers,
of course.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.708
-CHRISTOPHER: Tigger.
-Well, it might.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.000
Follow me.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.875
Here, slusher.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.875
Here, you big ugly slusher!

14:01.458 --> 14:04.708
Pooh? Piglet? Tigger?

14:04.708 --> 14:06.750
Wait a minute,
that's me.

14:06.750 --> 14:11.250
And I'm the only one.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:15.583 --> 14:18.333
Oh, no. The slusher!

14:18.333 --> 14:21.458
Don't boogedy boogedy me.
I'm on your side.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.333
In fact, some of my
best friends are slushers.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.750
-Tigger.

14:25.750 --> 14:28.083
I knew it was you
all along.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.458
As if I couldn't tell
a friendly noise

14:32.458 --> 14:33.875
from a slusher noise.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.708
Take this one,
for instance.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.833
Why, it's obvious
that it's--

14:37.833 --> 14:39.833
It's, um-- It's--

14:39.833 --> 14:41.958
One, two, three, four.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.958
-Uh-oh.
-It's the slusher!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.250
Hmm...

14:53.250 --> 14:57.750
Do all slushers sound like
large and hungry dogs?

14:57.750 --> 15:00.750
Nah, only the biggest
and meanest ones.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.708
Perhaps this is all a dream.

15:02.708 --> 15:05.833
Oh! Maybe if I pinch myself,
we would wake up.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.583
-Ouch!
-

15:08.583 --> 15:09.833
Oh, dear.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.833
Now what is it?

15:21.875 --> 15:24.333
Hello, operator?
Get me the police.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.375
If someone would go back to
Christopher Robin's house

15:30.375 --> 15:32.000
and get some weenies,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
would could use 'em to lure
the slusher to his doom.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.875
Wild "animimals" and slushers
just love weenies.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.708
Right, Tigger.
I'll get the weenies.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.083
But someone will have to
distract the slusher

15:44.083 --> 15:45.875
by running in
the other direction.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.166
Piglet's already
proven himself

15:49.166 --> 15:51.500
to be the bravest
of us all.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.625
-Me?
-Congratulations,
little Piglet.

15:55.625 --> 15:58.208
Always knew
you had it in ya.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.875
-Me?
-Yep, you, Piglet old pal.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.833
Besides, it'll be a snap.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.708
Unless, of course,
the slusher catches ya,

16:05.708 --> 16:09.208
-and slushes you to pieces.
-CHRISTOPHER: Tigger.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.000
Hey. It's a possibility.

16:12.583 --> 16:15.333
Well, if I must.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.083
What a lion heart.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.458
I hate to see ya go,

16:20.458 --> 16:23.208
-but ally-oop!
-

16:23.208 --> 16:24.458
I was just trying to help

16:24.458 --> 16:26.458
the brave little guy
get started.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.458
Piglet sure is courageous.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.208
I hope he'll be all right.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.583
Aw, he'll be fine.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.416
Did you see
the look on his face?

16:37.416 --> 16:40.250
Hoo-hoo! I've never seen him
havin' so much fun.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.875
Maybe I can hide in here.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.416
It's so filled with darkness,

16:49.416 --> 16:51.250
there'll be no room for
the slusher.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.416
I must be out of breath.

16:58.958 --> 17:00.875
Oh, my, I must be hungry.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.458
-Oh, dear!
-

17:08.458 --> 17:09.875
Yahhh!

17:09.875 --> 17:11.333
Yahhh!

17:11.333 --> 17:14.416
I believe I've heard
that sound before.

17:14.416 --> 17:17.208
Yahhh!

17:17.208 --> 17:19.000
What was that?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.583
Mm. Must have been
one of them

17:21.583 --> 17:23.958
"unidentifiabibble"
flyin' Piglets.

17:27.458 --> 17:30.458
Look. The slusher's
burying something.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.291
Is it Piglet?

17:40.291 --> 17:42.291
Aw, the poor little guy.

17:42.291 --> 17:45.583
Brave right down to the bone.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.750
Oh, no. It's me.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.500
What a loss.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.083
He was like a...
me to me.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.250
Piglet?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.583
Hm. Maybe he's been
re-incarcerated.

18:00.458 --> 18:04.291
Tell me that was just you,
rumbly tumbly Pooh boy.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.625
Please?

18:05.625 --> 18:08.458
I'm afraid
it wasn't my tumbly.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.291
Piglet?

18:12.583 --> 18:13.625
Eeyore?

18:15.500 --> 18:18.458
I think we're in trouble.

18:30.958 --> 18:34.958
POOH: Nice slusher.
Nice slusher.

18:34.958 --> 18:37.833
Knew this was
my unlucky day,

18:37.833 --> 18:41.291
just like every other one.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.500
Oh, look.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.000
It's not a slusher.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.458
Just a huge, horrible,
hungry dog.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.208
For a minute there,

18:51.208 --> 18:52.833
I thought we was in
real trouble.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.208
-Oh, my.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.708
Perhaps this hasn't turned out
so bad after all.

18:57.708 --> 19:00.000
MAN: Come out with
your hands up!

19:07.458 --> 19:11.000
Oh, no. The police are taking
Pooh and my other friends away.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.208
Me? It was all Pooh's idea.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.166
Uh, the night of the 32nd?

19:18.166 --> 19:20.750
I was sleeping,
I believe.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.583
Then it was Piglet's idea.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.500
I don't remember a thing.
I was young and foolish.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.708
I blame society.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.500
Eeyore, Eeyore's the one.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.583
Might as well confess.

19:31.583 --> 19:35.000
Got one of those
guilty faces, anyway.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.291
No, no, it was Tigger!
It was Tigger!

19:37.291 --> 19:40.250
It was Tig... ger.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.291
I want my lawyer.

19:42.291 --> 19:46.000
I find you guilty of
first degree causing noise,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.625
and I'm throwing
the book at you.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.708
It's too bad I can't read.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.875
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, no!
Stop! Stop!

19:57.875 --> 19:59.708
I confess. I confess!

19:59.708 --> 20:03.708
I-- I left my room
and went downstairs.

20:03.708 --> 20:07.083
Uh, and then I went next door
to look for the slusher.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.458
It was all my fault.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.250
I'm certain he can reform
if given the chance.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.125
He's not a bad boy,

20:14.125 --> 20:17.125
he's just
a little confused.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.583
-Like me.
-Go ahead, pal.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.083
Throw yourself on
the "mercenary" of the court.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.458
Please, I'm sorry.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.708
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.458
I'm--

20:29.458 --> 20:31.000
WOMAN: Christopher Robin.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.208
-Mom?
-You were having
a nightmare.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.250
Oh,
you know what happens

20:36.250 --> 20:38.500
when you watch
those kinds of movies.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.750
-Nightmare?
-Uh-huh.

20:40.750 --> 20:44.500
So upstairs, and this time
stay in bed, sweetheart,

20:44.500 --> 20:46.291
and you won't have
bad dreams.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.958
Pooh, we were dreaming.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.375
I'm so glad.

20:56.375 --> 20:59.000
Does this mean we're not
goin' to the big house?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.333
Or even the very small house?

21:01.333 --> 21:04.875
Like to go back to
my own house,

21:04.875 --> 21:07.500
not that it's much of one.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.875
It was all a dream.
A dream!

21:09.875 --> 21:11.500
-A dream!
-

21:15.708 --> 21:19.625
Gasp! The slusher's back.

21:19.625 --> 21:23.333
Didn't know slushers
used the doorbell.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.250
Oh, yeah, they can be
awful tricky.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.833
MAN: Uh, did anyone
order a pizza?

21:43.833 --> 21:45.333
WOMAN: Christopher Robin.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.458
POOH: On March 16th,

21:48.458 --> 21:50.708
Christopher Robin
was found guilty

21:50.708 --> 21:53.583
of leaving his bed
when he shouldn't have,

21:53.583 --> 21:57.000
and was placed in the custody
of his friends.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.958
Everything you've seen
was a dream.

21:58.958 --> 22:01.416
Only the names of the animals
have been changed

22:01.416 --> 22:02.833
to protect the innocent.
