Lewis and Nasty Kathy,
I just don't get it.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.625
- Clearly, Lewis is slumming.
- Yeah. He does that.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.125
Look at all those months
he spent with you.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.458

of wire fraud

of the public trust.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.000

when I refinanced the mortgage

back my hours at work.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.125
I just wanted
to say thank you.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.625
- You could have e-mailed.
- I could have e-mailed.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.834
Then I wouldn't be able
to do this.

to any sort of girlfriend

what other options do we have?

17:59.708 --> 18:01.208
Well, I will be working on
getting you

18:01.208 --> 18:02.583
an allowance from the court.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.000
And I will also make a motion

18:04.000 --> 18:06.750
to get the bail reduced,
but there's a very good chance

18:06.750 --> 18:09.042
that the judge
will not allow that

18:09.042 --> 18:10.542
'so, you're gonna have
to get a loan'

18:10.542 --> 18:13.167

with a bail bondsman.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.333
Well, I have tried that,
but without collateral

18:15.333 --> 18:17.166

ask the church.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

- Angel Fund?

do we have, Mr. Parrish?

You really know how
to make a girl feel special.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.792
Come on, Marti.
Take a look at yourself.

34:57.792 --> 34:59.834
You're like an advertisement
for a male's mid-life crisis.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.750
When we walk down
the street together

35:01.750 --> 35:05.209
onlookers probably think
I've just purchased a Porsche.

35:05.209 --> 35:08.042
You're not dating onlookers.
You're dating me.

35:10.208 --> 35:12.792
What's important
is how you see me.

35:15.084 --> 35:16.542
'So tell me.'

35:18.667 --> 35:21.875
- Tell you what exactly--
- 'How do you see me?'

35:21.875 --> 35:24.250
What is it
you-you like about me?

35:27.209 --> 35:29.291
Why are you in this?

35:30.417 --> 35:33.084
Is this a challenge?

35:35.291 --> 35:37.000
[sighs]

35:38.583 --> 35:41.125
You are a fascinating

35:41.125 --> 35:43.667
occasionally maddening woman.

35:46.125 --> 35:48.959
You have a quicksilver mind
and a gigantic heart.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.834
You love your friends
to a fault

35:51.834 --> 35:55.084
'and you despise injustice
with a white-hot intensity.'

35:55.084 --> 35:57.834
You resist authority, not
because you're an anarchist

35:57.834 --> 35:59.250
but because..

35:59.250 --> 36:01.834
...you're a leader by nature.

36:03.792 --> 36:06.583
And you refuse to be bullied,
and you will not allow me

36:06.583 --> 36:09.708
to win an argument
if you know you're right.

36:12.084 --> 36:14.959
And you're not afraid
to laugh at yourself.

36:17.667 --> 36:22.167
And you're a slightly,
slightly better guitar
player than I am.

36:25.208 --> 36:30.500
And that, Marti Perkins,
is but a small sampling

36:30.500 --> 36:33.084
of the things
I like about you.

36:38.125 --> 36:41.166
Oh. Okay.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.333
[instrumental music]

37:17.333 --> 37:19.583
I heard your dad's
out on bail.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.875
I'm glad to hear it.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.500
- I bet.
- I am.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.375
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

37:28.375 --> 37:32.458
I was upset, and I shot
my mouth off in a bad way.

37:34.667 --> 37:36.209
It's okay.

37:37.417 --> 37:41.375
Look, I'm propping up
my whole family right now.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.667
I need to know
I can depend on you.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.625
Understood.

37:49.041 --> 37:52.291
Go ahead. Depend.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.000
[cell phone rings]

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
- It's my dad.
- Yeah.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Hey, daddy,
everything okay at home?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.375
(Parker)
'I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.'

38:03.375 --> 38:07.042
Goodbye?
What are you talking about?

38:07.042 --> 38:08.083
Sweetheart, I have made
some mistakes

38:08.083 --> 38:10.750
and I cannot make them
right in prison

38:10.750 --> 38:13.125
and I can't-I can't
go back there.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.667
Oh, God.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.834
'I am so sorry
for letting you down'

38:17.834 --> 38:20.542
'but I am gonna win back
your trust someday.'

38:20.542 --> 38:22.000
Now, look, you have
to take care of your mother

38:22.000 --> 38:23.458
and you have to take care
of your sister.

38:23.458 --> 38:26.625
They are gonna need
your strength right now.

38:26.625 --> 38:28.500
You can't.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.625
You're going to ruin us.

38:30.625 --> 38:33.208
Please, daddy, don't.

38:33.208 --> 38:35.917
I love you, sweet,
I love you, sweetheart.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.041
[sobbing]

38:40.041 --> 38:43.042
