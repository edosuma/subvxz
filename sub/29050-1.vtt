Any way that you could get us

- What?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.360
No, it's just
with our schedules,

11:05.490 --> 11:07.318
we're barely pulling it off
as it is now.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.190
I know.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.757
So how are we gonna do this?

11:10.887 --> 11:12.280

You're always turned on.

No hickies. I have to interview
candidates tomorrow.

I know, I know. I'm trying
to be your top candidate.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.136
I might have a job for you.

11:58.587 --> 12:02.678
So tell me a little bit
about yourself.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.594
Well, I'm definitely
a self-starter.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.249
At my last job, I was the first
one in, the last one to leave.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.077
So I'm more of a Type-A,

12:10.207 --> 12:12.253
so you don't have to tell me
to do anything twice.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.473
Okay. Full disclosure,

12:15.604 --> 12:18.389
and I don't even know if
I'm allowed to be asking this,

12:18.520 --> 12:21.741
but you wouldn't have a problem
assisting a woman, would you?

12:21.871 --> 12:23.655
Oh, no, of course not.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.570
No, I actually have
four sisters.

Four? Wow.
I'm an only child, so...

12:28.660 --> 12:32.055
Yeah, I really love
having sisters.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.318
I think if I had brothers,
I would miss out on a lot.

Like what?

12:36.668 --> 12:38.583

to squeeze you in today,

13:12.966 --> 13:15.272
I'll call Cindy
and let her know.

What are you doing?

13:17.100 --> 13:20.190
Saving this company
from making a huge mistake.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.193
Do you see the brunette woman
to my right?

13:23.324 --> 13:25.065
Don't be obvious.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.980
Lisa Blanchard?
What about her?

13:27.110 --> 13:29.809
Oh, just that maybe
she's a raging meth addict.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.767
How do you know that?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.944
Look, I used to work
with her brother Larry, okay?

13:35.075 --> 13:36.990
She basically destroyed
the whole family.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.383

MELANIE:
So a little bit about us,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.964
The Reynolds Group
is a mid-level agency,

13:55.095 --> 13:56.966
but Samantha likes to think
like the big dogs.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.663
We've got a ton
of local accounts,

13:58.794 --> 14:00.622
but we're always looking
for national advertisers.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.190
Of course you are.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.280
If I can ask, what happened
to your last assistant?

14:06.410 --> 14:09.109
Well, if I hire you,
you'd be my first.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.198
I just got the promotion
last week.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.418
Virgin executive. Wow.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.682
Feeling a little overwhelmed
or what?

14:17.813 --> 14:19.989
I should probably say no...

14:20.120 --> 14:23.123
But the reality is
you're freaking out inside.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.255
Like you don't know
what you're doing,

14:25.386 --> 14:29.303
and you're terrified everyone's
gonna find out any minute.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.829
Don't worry.
That's why I'm here.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.441
And I see by that gorgeous ring
you are married.

14:37.572 --> 14:38.703
Yeah.

14:38.834 --> 14:39.879
Do you have any kids?

14:40.009 --> 14:42.882
Oh, yeah, Tina. She's seven.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.319
Oh, my God. Stunning.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.234
Her mommy must be so proud.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.107
What about you?
Do you have any family?

14:51.238 --> 14:52.413
None to speak of.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.154
My parents died
when I was a kid.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.155
It's just me.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.374
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.637
My dad died
when I was a kid too.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.509
So you get it.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.641
It's nice to meet
someone who understands.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.341
I'd really love
to have kids one day.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.129
So I am...
I'm new to this whole thing,

15:13.260 --> 15:15.653
but why don't you just tell me
a little bit about yourself?

15:15.784 --> 15:17.525
Uh, sure.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.136
I'd say I'm all about
female empowerment.

15:20.267 --> 15:23.226
Me Too, job equality,
all of that.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.794
But I am also about being
brave enough to ask for help

15:25.925 --> 15:27.100
when you need it.

15:27.230 --> 15:30.277
Women taking care
of other women.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.583
For some reason, we can't stop
tearing each other down

15:32.714 --> 15:37.197
when the fact is, we're the
majority in this country.

15:37.327 --> 15:40.940
What do you think would happen
if we all got together one day?

15:41.070 --> 15:43.768
We'd rule everything.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.728
And if you hire me,
that's exactly what I'll do.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.077
What's that?

15:48.208 --> 15:49.687
Take care of you.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.167
I'll have exactly what you need

15:51.298 --> 15:53.169
before you even know
you needed it.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.956
Do you have
any other questions for me?

15:58.435 --> 16:00.263
Well, there is something.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.439
You can say it.

16:02.570 --> 16:05.703
You're slightly older than
some of the other candidates.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.402
Is that a problem for you?

16:08.532 --> 16:10.882
I don't know. I haven't really
thought about it.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.623
Do you want to know
what I think?

16:12.754 --> 16:14.451
Please.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.236
Having someone with
a little bit more experience

16:16.366 --> 16:18.890
is exactly what
a first-time executive needs.

16:19.021 --> 16:23.330
It balances out the greenness
with an extra touch of know-how.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.942
Just think of me as a sister.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.995
I know who I want.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.344
Phoebe Sutton.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.346
Decisive. Good job.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.738
Yeah, I don't know.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.089
I just have this
great feeling about her.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.308
Well, I hope you chose wisely,
Melanie.

16:45.439 --> 16:48.181
This Phoebe will pretty much
be taking over your life,

16:48.311 --> 16:50.226
and there is nothing that
makes life more miserable

16:50.357 --> 16:52.011
than the wrong assistant.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.751
I know she's gonna kill it.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.058
Okay, well, with you moving up,

16:56.189 --> 16:58.539
we're going to need another
assistant as a floater.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.236
Was there anyone else you liked?

17:00.367 --> 17:03.326
Uh, Jason Lipp.
He was pretty good.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.893
Okay, done.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.068
I'll have HR check his records.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.636
You've had hers checked, right?

17:08.766 --> 17:09.767
Of course, yeah.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.291
Good.

17:25.783 --> 17:26.958
[line ringing]

17:27.089 --> 17:28.221
WOMAN: Hello?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.223
Hi, is this Kellyanne Darcy?

17:30.353 --> 17:31.398
Yeah.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.835
Hi. I'm Melanie Anderson.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.142
I'm calling about
a Phoebe Sutton.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.708
She has you as a reference
on her résumé.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.536
Her only work reference.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.278
That's 'cause I'm the only boss
she's ever had.

17:42.409 --> 17:46.630
She worked for me
for 12 years or something.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.242
Oh, well, I'm considering
being her second.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.288
You should. She's great.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.029
Whatever you need,
Phoebe's got you.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.510
And whenever things
get hectic at home,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.426
she'll make sure that
you're on time and ready.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.341
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.044
Are you happy?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.177
Not yet.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.830
[ringing]

18:16.791 --> 18:17.922
This is Phoebe.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.750
Hi, Phoebe.
It's Melanie.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.666
Melanie! I know you said
you'd let me know soon,

18:22.797 --> 18:25.016
but this is ridiculous.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.757
I know what I want
when I see it.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.282
Me too.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.587
So does this mean...

18:30.718 --> 18:32.372
Do you want the job?

18:32.502 --> 18:35.201
Do you even have to ask?
Of course I do.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.028
Thank you.
I would have told you sooner,

18:37.159 --> 18:39.030
but I had to check
your reference first.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.990
Oh, checking up on me.
Good for you.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.948
Kellyanne couldn't say
enough good things about you.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.864
Well, she is the best.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.911
So I'll see you in the office
tomorrow morning, 9 a.m.?

18:50.041 --> 18:53.306
9 a.m.? Please.
I will be there at 8:30.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.308
[chuckles]
Thank you again.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.266
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.354
Bye.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.573
Bye.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.318
Now I'm happy.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.370
[ding]

19:21.682 --> 19:23.858
Good morning.
Roger Kirkland, right?

19:23.988 --> 19:25.599
You know who I am.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.601
Of course.
You're one of Bill's clients.

19:27.731 --> 19:28.776
You, um...

19:28.906 --> 19:31.605
Own Kirkland Auto,

19:31.735 --> 19:34.695
third largest dealership
in the country.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.523
Whoo-hoo! Hallelujah.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.003
Samantha finally hired
someone with a decent memory.

19:39.134 --> 19:42.006
So listen, I don't know
if you're in the market

19:42.137 --> 19:43.660
for a new vehicle...

19:43.791 --> 19:46.533
Oh, I am always looking
for a new ride.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.666
ROGER: I could put together a
package on a tasty little lease.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.929
Let me know
if you are interested.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.845
Phoebe.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.500
You know, you remind me
of someone I used to know.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.416
You're telling me
there's another guy out there

20:00.547 --> 20:02.636
as handsome and worldy as I am?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.028
[laughs]

20:04.159 --> 20:06.248
Hello, everyone.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.250
Roger, I see that
you've met Melanie.

20:08.381 --> 20:09.773
She'll be taking
over Bill's desk,

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
and Phoebe here
will be assisting.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.996
Ah! Lucky me.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.912
I'm really looking forward
to working together.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.958
Nice to meet you.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.700
Mm-hmm. It was a pleasure
to meet you.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.660
- I'll see you in my office?
- Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.533
So have you talked
to that friend of yours?

20:30.664 --> 20:32.187
I'm working on it.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.493
Work harder.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.678
Last but not least,
we have Susan Gladwell

20:44.808 --> 20:45.809
at Wellness Yoga.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.768
She has two locations downtown.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.378
Namaste.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.293
I think that's it.

20:51.424 --> 20:54.514
I'm gonna call everyone tomorrow
and introduce myself.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.385
You should probably
do the same at some point.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.734
Oh, I already did that.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.217
- You spoke with all of them?
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
[scoffs]
I...

21:04.437 --> 21:06.308
I really wish
you would have waited.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.311
Well, you wanted me
to be proactive.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.575
Don't worry. I went on and on
about how wonderful you are.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.969
Yeah, well, except to
Barbara Rodrick at Yowsers.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.710
I couldn't get ahold of her.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.714
Yeah, I haven't been able
to reach her either.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.977
Okay, well, I will
make a spreadsheet

21:23.107 --> 21:24.544
of all of these names tomorrow.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.154
Thanks.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.677
You really are
doing a great job.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.463
Namaste.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.639
Oh, can I talk to you
for a second before you go?

21:32.769 --> 21:33.988
Sure, what's up?

21:34.118 --> 21:36.425
[sighs]
It's about this morning.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.035
Roger Kirkland.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.994
What about it?

21:40.124 --> 21:42.475
Little heavy on the flirting,
don't you think?

21:42.605 --> 21:44.999
I was just being nice.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.916
Yeah, well, I don't want people
to get the wrong impression.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.701
What are you suggesting,
that I'd sleep with a client?

21:51.832 --> 21:54.661
No! I think it was
a little inappropriate.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.880
[chuckles] Well, I am sorry
for being so inappropriate

21:57.011 --> 21:59.405
on my first day.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.102
I'm sorry.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.973
You're right.
Of course you're right.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.324
It doesn't take much
to give men the wrong idea.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.891
I will be more aware of it
from now on, I promise.

22:08.022 --> 22:08.892
Thank you.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.677
[phone ringing]

22:13.593 --> 22:15.595
Oh!

22:15.725 --> 22:17.814
Barbara, thanks for calling.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.121
I'll always have time
for my old roomie.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.123
Excuse me. Old?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.907
[laughs]
Okay, more like old school.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.562
- How are you?
- I'm great.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.172
Are you up for
grabbing a drink soon?

22:28.303 --> 22:29.260
I'd love to catch up.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.219
Yeah, me as well.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.134
Call my assistant, set it up.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.701
Yeah, well,
I'm at Reynolds Group now,

22:34.831 --> 22:36.920
so I can just have my assistant
reach out to yours.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.532
Nice, great, look forward to it.

22:39.662 --> 22:42.752
Okay, talk to you soon. Bye.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.841
Sounds like
Barbara called you back.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.367
Yeah, she's actually
a friend of mine from college.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.978
And Samantha keeps telling me
to reach out to her.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.110
Guess I'm making a play
for her company.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.417
Guessing is for game shows.

22:55.548 --> 22:58.899
You are getting that account.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.814
Come on, say it out loud.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.293
Come on, no.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.470
Hey, you put it out
in the universe,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.385
you give it a chance
to enter your world.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.691
Go on, say it.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.694
I am getting that account.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.349
Great. Sounds like I've
got a meeting to set up.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.524
No, you can do it tomorrow.
It's late.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.265
I'm gonna head home.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.921
Hey, do you wanna grab a drink?

23:21.051 --> 23:24.359
Thanks for the invite, but I
gotta head home to my family.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
Come on, Mel.
It's healthy to have a cocktail

23:26.796 --> 23:28.711
with the people
you work closely with.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.148
You never know what you
might learn about them.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
Plus, we definitely
have to celebrate

23:33.237 --> 23:35.065
that phone call from Yowsers.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.417
All right, sure.
Yeah, let's do it.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.635
Okay!

23:44.466 --> 23:46.947
Okay, so be honest.
How did I do today?

23:47.077 --> 23:51.212
Aside from the flirty banter,
I think it went really well.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.780
And trust me,
you're not the first girl

23:53.910 --> 23:55.782
Roger's come on to
at the office.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.219
Oh, God, men are such dogs.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.704
Okay, what was that look?

24:04.834 --> 24:07.054
[laughs]

24:07.184 --> 24:10.100
Nothing. It was just
old college stuff.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.276
Ah! Now you gotta tell me.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.802
Come on, Mel,
if this is gonna work,

24:15.932 --> 24:17.064
you have to trust me.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.283
Who am I gonna tell?

24:22.069 --> 24:23.984
Okay, you know my friend
at Yowsers?

24:24.114 --> 24:25.986
Barbara Rodrick, yes.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.902
This is so silly, I...

24:29.032 --> 24:32.471
I made out once with
her boyfriend at the time.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.951
Joe... Can't even remember
his last name.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.258
Barbara never found out,
thank God.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.435
Ancient history, right?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.829
What happens in college,
stays in college.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.963
Hey, Mel, I have your back.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.748
You can trust me.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.229
We should get out of here.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.361
I'm gonna go
to the ladies' room.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.536
Okay.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.165
Got room for one more?

25:15.296 --> 25:17.646
- Mom!
- Hey, baby.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.822
So how was it? How was drinks
with your assistant?

25:19.953 --> 25:22.085
Great. I think it's gonna
work out really nicely.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.130
[doorbell rings]

25:23.260 --> 25:24.523
I'll get it.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.263
You expecting someone?

25:26.394 --> 25:28.265
- No, but maybe you should...
- Yeah.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.138
[door opens]

25:33.706 --> 25:35.577
Honey, you got a visitor.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.971
Hey, what are you doing here?

25:38.101 --> 25:40.277
Found this near your car
when you pulled away.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.105
- You did?
- Must have fallen out.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.585
I would have called it,

25:43.716 --> 25:45.152

38:57.030 --> 38:58.945
I didn't mean
to scare you, boss.

38:59.075 --> 39:02.122
- So how did it go?
- Oh, she is an angel.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.385
I just checked on her.
Out like a light.

39:07.214 --> 39:11.349
So how was the big dinner?

39:11.479 --> 39:12.785
- It was good.
- Great.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.050
All right, well, I should leave
you two lovebirds alone.

You know,
anniversary sex and all.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.058
Oh, Tina's party
is probably gonna be amazing,

39:25.188 --> 39:28.409
and she kind of invited me.

39:28.540 --> 39:29.715
Oh, well, you should come then.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.500
I mean, if it's not a problem.

39:34.284 --> 39:35.982
No, you should come.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.853
I'd love to.

39:37.984 --> 39:40.595
I have a few stops to make
over the weekend, but yeah.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.945
Well, I guess
we'll see you there.

39:44.599 --> 39:45.644
Bye.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.299
Bye.

Why... Why didn't you
ask me first?

39:57.569 --> 39:59.788
What was I supposed to say?
Tina invited her.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.269
I don't know, but it seems like
that woman is always around us.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.533
I think it's important to have
boundaries with your employees.

40:05.664 --> 40:09.319
Yeah, so what's she doing here
in the first place?

40:09.450 --> 40:12.061
Come on, you said so yourself.
She did us a big favor tonight.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.672
Well, maybe she'll do you
another favor tomorrow.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.326

The one about your package?

40:41.526 --> 40:44.224
That's the one.
Want a little sneak preview?

40:45.573 --> 40:47.836
Sure, hit me.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.925
You've done this before.
I knew it.

Okay, here we go.

Mmm! Look at you.

What's with the gloves?

41:52.335 --> 41:55.469
I don't know.
I think they're kinda sexy.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.514
You don't like 'em.

No I do, I do, I do, yeah.

Mm-mm-mm!

What you got hiding under there?

42:05.479 --> 42:07.481
Wouldn't you like to know.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.706
Play fair.
I showed you mine.

42:14.836 --> 42:18.318
Yeah, you did.

42:18.448 --> 42:21.016
Not exactly the package
I was expecting.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.584
Oh, disappointed?

42:23.715 --> 42:27.066
That's not what I said.

42:27.196 --> 42:29.242
So how often do you do it?

42:31.331 --> 42:32.898
Do what?

42:33.028 --> 42:36.336
Send out unsolicited pictures
of your junk.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.385
I wouldn't exactly call it
"unsolicited."

42:42.516 --> 42:45.650
I mean, you are sitting here
in my office.

42:45.780 --> 42:50.306
Ah, so that means I've accepted
an invitation for sex.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.309
If the pic is a fit,
you must sit.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.398

Do you have any others?

Maybe.

43:02.667 --> 43:03.755
Pull 'em up.

Why don't I just pull it out?

43:05.974 --> 43:08.237
[laughs]

43:08.368 --> 43:10.805
Because a real woman
likes to be teased.

God, you're twisted.
I love that.

43:13.025 --> 43:15.505

Okay, dim those lights and...

Ooh, that is a nice one.

to get the angle just right.

43:27.822 --> 43:30.564
Look at the shadow on the left
right there.

43:30.695 --> 43:34.263
God, you do remind me
of a guy I used to know.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.657
You said that before.

43:36.788 --> 43:38.398
Who are you talking about,
an old boyfriend?

43:38.528 --> 43:41.575
No, just a foster father
I used to have.

43:41.706 --> 43:45.100
A father? And he showed you

I don't know how you do it.

keep up with Jimmy.

Wait, wait, wait, back up.
What happened?

46:17.252 --> 46:18.688
Oh, relax.
Tina likes a boy,

46:18.819 --> 46:20.821

to give her a birthday kiss.

a little.

that little boy kiss her?

to make her day special.

47:54.523 --> 47:55.568
What?

47:55.698 --> 47:57.396
Yeah. Found out this morning.

47:57.526 --> 47:59.920
And here's the craziest part.

48:00.051 --> 48:02.314
You know that whole
autoerotic...

48:02.444 --> 48:04.142

48:06.274 --> 48:07.188
Yeah.

48:07.319 --> 48:09.016
Is that when they...

48:09.147 --> 48:10.104
Yeah.

48:10.235 --> 48:11.192
While they're...

48:11.323 --> 48:13.194
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

48:13.325 --> 48:16.110
Oh, my God.
How does that even work?

48:16.241 --> 48:18.547
Sometimes guys
will hang themselves

48:18.678 --> 48:20.680

than them,

48:20.810 --> 48:22.464
like a doorknob,

48:22.595 --> 48:25.337
so they can stand up
before it's too late.

48:25.467 --> 48:28.253
But the lack of oxygen
screws them up,

48:28.383 --> 48:32.518
and they pass out...
and die.

48:36.174 --> 48:37.392
So I've heard.

48:37.523 --> 48:39.655
Okay, anyways, um,

48:39.786 --> 48:41.179

think happened.

In any case,
looks like your assistant's

As I was saying,

49:14.386 --> 49:17.911
last week I gave the assistants
a chance to step up,

49:18.042 --> 49:21.132
and I am proud to say
that someone did.

49:21.262 --> 49:22.872

follow this young lady's lead.

something about hustling

Those were my leads!

51:06.585 --> 51:09.109
Oh, poor Laura.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.329
Haven't you ever
heard the expression

51:11.459 --> 51:13.070
"dog eat dog?"

51:13.200 --> 51:15.507
So you're not even
gonna bother denying it.

51:15.637 --> 51:16.986
Deny what?

51:17.117 --> 51:20.468
The big boss
asked us to do a job,

51:20.599 --> 51:23.428
and I admit
I went out and did it.

51:23.558 --> 51:25.734
It's called Darwinism.

51:25.865 --> 51:27.823
Don't hate. Appreciate.

51:29.912 --> 51:32.698
You hired her.
I blame you.

51:42.534 --> 51:43.404
Listen, Mel...

51:43.535 --> 51:44.449
You're fired.

51:44.579 --> 51:45.624
[laughs]

51:45.754 --> 51:46.929
You think that's funny?

51:47.060 --> 51:50.107
Uh, you just heard Sam.

51:50.237 --> 51:51.891
And you just heard me.

51:52.021 --> 51:54.415
What you did
was not only unethical,

51:54.546 --> 51:56.069
it was cheap.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.202
I didn't like it,
and neither will Sam.

51:58.332 --> 52:00.682
Hmm. Should we go ask her?

52:00.813 --> 52:02.423
You don't get
to decide anything.

52:02.554 --> 52:03.816
Get your stuff and leave.

52:03.946 --> 52:06.123
And don't go whining to Sam.

52:06.253 --> 52:08.864
You don't work here anymore.

52:08.995 --> 52:11.911
I know what this
is really about.

52:12.041 --> 52:14.522
You don't like
that your daughter

52:14.653 --> 52:17.177
likes me more than you.

52:18.439 --> 52:20.137
And I could have Alex

52:20.267 --> 52:23.140
wrapped around
this little finger so fast,

52:23.270 --> 52:24.967
it would make your head spin.

52:25.098 --> 52:26.969
Other parts of me too.

52:27.100 --> 52:29.972
Urrgh! What is your problem?

52:30.103 --> 52:33.324
My problem is you don't
appreciate what you have.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.458
You want me to call security?

52:37.589 --> 52:39.547
Don't bother, Mel.

52:39.678 --> 52:40.722
See you around.

52:40.853 --> 52:42.115
If I do, I'm calling the cops!

52:42.246 --> 52:44.073
Ooh.

52:56.869 --> 52:58.958
I have to
tell you something, Sam.

52:59.088 --> 53:01.787
What a coincidence.
I have something to tell you.

53:01.917 --> 53:04.703
You need to get
on your game, Melanie.

53:04.833 --> 53:08.489
Honestly, the best thing that
you've done since your promotion

53:08.620 --> 53:09.969
was hiring Phoebe.

53:10.099 --> 53:11.840
She told me that she was the one

53:11.971 --> 53:15.104
that set up your meeting
with Yowsers tomorrow morning.

53:15.235 --> 53:16.236
She did.

53:16.367 --> 53:17.933
Good.

53:18.064 --> 53:20.197
Don't blow it.

53:20.327 --> 53:21.372
Anything else?

53:22.460 --> 53:23.417
No.

53:34.994 --> 53:36.517
You all right?

53:36.648 --> 53:38.519
You barely said two words
to me last night.

53:38.650 --> 53:39.433
Now you're tripping all over
yourself this morning.

53:39.564 --> 53:41.348
I've got a breakfast meeting,

53:41.479 --> 53:43.220
and it's really important,
and I can't be late.

53:43.350 --> 53:45.439
I thought Phoebe was supposed
to sort that stuff out for you.

53:45.570 --> 53:48.050
Well, I fired her yesterday,
so now I'm kind of on my own.

53:48.181 --> 53:50.401
Wait, what? You fired her?

53:50.531 --> 53:52.185
You didn't tell me about it?

53:52.316 --> 53:53.578
I don't have time to talk
about this right now,

53:53.708 --> 53:55.188
I need to find my purse.

53:55.319 --> 53:58.496
Okay, all right.
I'll get out of your way.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.976
Hey, Mel.

54:03.109 --> 54:04.284
[sighs]

54:25.610 --> 54:26.480
Barbara!

54:27.742 --> 54:28.961
Uh...

54:29.091 --> 54:30.310
Long time no see.

54:31.529 --> 54:34.096
What do you want, Melanie?

54:34.227 --> 54:35.663
Just want to catch up.

54:35.794 --> 54:38.144
Yeah, right.
Just get to it.

54:41.016 --> 54:43.018
Well, you know I'm with
the Reynolds Group.

54:43.149 --> 54:45.151
Mm-hmm.

54:45.282 --> 54:49.764
I just thought maybe we could
come in and pitch you guys.

54:50.896 --> 54:52.245
Old school, right?

54:52.376 --> 54:54.160
Old school.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.467
You mean like back in the day,
that kind of thing?

54:56.597 --> 54:58.338
Sure.

54:58.469 --> 55:01.472
Like the time you made out
with Joel behind my back?

55:01.602 --> 55:03.300
Barbara...

55:03.430 --> 55:06.781
I got a call on my way here,
heard all about it.

55:06.912 --> 55:09.958
You know, I couldn't be sure
it was true

55:10.089 --> 55:12.309
until I saw your face.

55:13.962 --> 55:15.529
Phoebe called you.

55:15.660 --> 55:18.663
"Ancient history."
That's what you said?

55:18.793 --> 55:20.621
Like that makes it all okay?

55:20.752 --> 55:23.276
It was just a kiss.

55:23.407 --> 55:25.452
I trusted you
with my boyfriend then,

55:25.583 --> 55:27.106
and you screwed me.

55:27.236 --> 55:30.109
Why would I trust you
with my business now?

55:30.239 --> 55:31.632
Barbara.

55:37.246 --> 55:39.336
I have some bad news, Sam.

55:43.383 --> 55:46.168
What are you doing here?
I fired you.

55:46.299 --> 55:48.083
And who are you to do that?

55:48.214 --> 55:50.042
Her boss.

55:50.172 --> 55:52.566
Last time I checked,
I was yours.

55:52.697 --> 55:55.264
So what's this bad news anyway?

55:55.395 --> 55:58.877
Let me guess.
The Yowsers account?

56:01.314 --> 56:03.272
Your friend Barbara called,

56:03.403 --> 56:05.231
said that she wants
to hear our pitch

56:05.362 --> 56:07.668
anytime that we want to come in,

56:07.799 --> 56:09.627
under one condition:

56:09.757 --> 56:11.977
that you're nowhere
near the account.

56:12.107 --> 56:15.459
So I'll take it from here,
with Phoebe's help.

56:15.589 --> 56:17.548
Barbara specially
requested her on this,

56:17.678 --> 56:19.288
said she trusts her.

56:19.419 --> 56:22.030
She trusts her?
Are you kidding me?

56:22.161 --> 56:24.381
You don't know who she is, Sam.
She's a liar.

56:24.511 --> 56:26.295
She stole that list.

56:26.426 --> 56:27.384
Those were Laura's contacts.

56:27.514 --> 56:28.472
Is that true?

56:29.690 --> 56:30.865
Early bird gets the worm.

56:30.996 --> 56:33.041
Yeah, it does.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.350
Okay, so you don't care
that she has zero ethics.

56:37.481 --> 56:40.222
But it's not just that.
She is invading my life.

56:40.353 --> 56:41.746
What are you talking about?

56:41.876 --> 56:43.574
She flirts with my husband,

56:43.704 --> 56:46.228
she screws with my kid's head,

56:46.359 --> 56:47.534
and then this morning, look!

56:47.665 --> 56:50.711
This is what I find.

56:50.842 --> 56:51.756
What's that?

56:51.886 --> 56:53.061
A camera in my bedroom!

56:53.192 --> 56:54.367
Were you watching us?

56:54.498 --> 56:56.021
Calm down, Melanie.

56:56.151 --> 56:58.110
She's twisted!
You tell her right now.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.981
You tell her what you did.

57:00.112 --> 57:02.114
Well, what about
what you've done?

57:02.244 --> 57:03.681
What are you talking about?

57:03.811 --> 57:05.857
You should know we frown upon
too much contact

57:05.987 --> 57:07.685
outside the office
with our assistants.

57:07.815 --> 57:10.209
No, she came
to a birthday party.

57:10.339 --> 57:13.081
That's not what I mean,
and I quote,

57:13.212 --> 57:15.214
"I don't want to be
one of those bosses

57:15.344 --> 57:17.129
that makes you feel
that you can get ahead

57:17.259 --> 57:20.045
by offering too much help
outside the office."

57:20.175 --> 57:21.873
And I don't.

57:22.003 --> 57:23.178
Then why did you ask her
to babysit your daughter?

57:23.309 --> 57:24.397
I didn't.

57:24.528 --> 57:25.746
You didn't?

57:25.877 --> 57:27.705
You volunteered.

57:27.835 --> 57:30.490
See, no, that's not
how I remember it.

57:30.621 --> 57:33.667
I was thinking I was gonna
lose my job if I said no.

57:33.798 --> 57:35.843
Oh, my God, you are so full of...

57:35.974 --> 57:38.280
And now you're accusing me of
planting cameras in your house.

57:38.411 --> 57:40.195
Are you hearing this?

57:40.326 --> 57:42.546
Melanie, I'm beginning to think

57:42.676 --> 57:44.765
that you just don't understand
the boundaries that exist

57:44.896 --> 57:46.637
on the executive level.

57:46.767 --> 57:49.901
I'm beginning to wonder
if I promoted the wrong person.

57:50.031 --> 57:52.512
Maybe you should take
the rest of the day off,

57:52.643 --> 57:55.689
give us both a little time
to think about your future here.

58:15.535 --> 58:16.754
Follow me.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.509
I can't believe
you told Barbara.

58:32.639 --> 58:35.294
You're the one that kissed
her boyfriend, not me.

58:35.424 --> 58:38.166
Don't you remember
that whole dog-eat-dog thing

58:38.297 --> 58:39.907
I schooled Laura on?

58:40.038 --> 58:41.735
You should have been
paying attention.

58:41.866 --> 58:43.650
But what you really need
to remember

58:43.781 --> 58:45.652
is what I told you before.

58:45.783 --> 58:48.481
Some people just don't deserve
what they have,

58:48.612 --> 58:50.309
and they never will.

58:50.439 --> 58:54.008
But you know the one thing
you all have in common?

58:54.139 --> 58:57.621
You never think there's a chance
it can all be taken away.

58:59.405 --> 59:02.103
Shouldn't you be
heading home, Mommy?

59:02.234 --> 59:03.148
Screw you.

59:03.278 --> 59:04.976
See, if I were you,

59:05.106 --> 59:07.065
I'd try screwing Alex
for a change.

59:08.980 --> 59:10.503
So you did
put the camera in there.

59:10.634 --> 59:12.549
I'm not saying that.

59:12.679 --> 59:14.638
I'm just saying I haven't seen
a guy need it that bad

59:14.768 --> 59:16.553
since freshman year
of high school.

59:20.948 --> 59:21.906
[door closes]

59:22.036 --> 59:23.342
What happened?

59:23.472 --> 59:25.083
I'm going home.

59:25.213 --> 59:26.258
What do you mean? Why?

59:26.388 --> 59:28.086
Ask the new girl.

59:45.538 --> 59:46.974
LAURA: I know what you are.

59:48.410 --> 59:49.803
And how do you know that?

59:49.934 --> 59:51.892
'Cause I'm good
at spotting snakes.

59:52.023 --> 59:53.807
Are you now?

59:53.938 --> 59:55.156
Mm.

59:55.287 --> 59:57.071
And what are you good at?

59:57.202 --> 59:59.160
Cyber forensics.

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:02.163
I was a computer science major,

1:00:02.294 --> 1:00:04.644
so I can find out anything
on anyone.

1:00:07.038 --> 1:00:11.651
Look at that face.
What you hiding there, Pheebs?

1:00:11.782 --> 1:00:13.479
Can't wait to find out.

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:16.177
You're done here.

1:00:19.528 --> 1:00:20.486
[clicks tongue]

1:01:26.857 --> 1:01:28.728
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to call.

1:01:28.859 --> 1:01:31.035
I did a little bit of research
on our friend here,

1:01:31.165 --> 1:01:34.168
and it turns out her name's
not even Phoebe Sutton.

1:01:34.299 --> 1:01:36.257
It's Lisa Nolan.

1:01:36.388 --> 1:01:41.001
And her last known location was
actually some treatment center.

1:01:41.132 --> 1:01:42.960
32 Elm Road.

1:01:43.090 --> 1:01:44.962
Just give me a call back
when you can, okay?

1:01:45.092 --> 1:01:46.137
All right.

1:02:06.113 --> 1:02:07.201
[yawns]

1:02:23.217 --> 1:02:26.177
[shower running]

1:03:17.924 --> 1:03:19.012
[door closes]

1:03:54.004 --> 1:03:54.874
[grunts]

1:04:05.754 --> 1:04:09.106
[tapping on window]

1:04:10.803 --> 1:04:13.371
You've gotta be kidding me.

1:04:15.373 --> 1:04:16.504
Move.

1:04:16.635 --> 1:04:17.941
You have to hear me out.

1:04:18.071 --> 1:04:19.072
Move now.

1:04:19.203 --> 1:04:21.727
I brought you a peace offering.

1:04:29.387 --> 1:04:31.171
I can't believe I even let you
in after what you did today.

1:04:31.302 --> 1:04:33.086
Then why did you?

1:04:33.217 --> 1:04:36.263
To finish saying what I was
trying to tell you earlier.

1:04:36.394 --> 1:04:39.484
I'm telling you, woman to woman,

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:41.138
leave me and my family
the hell alone.

1:04:41.268 --> 1:04:44.532
Look, I know I probably
did some things

1:04:44.663 --> 1:04:45.620
that I shouldn't have.

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:46.839
Probably?

1:04:46.970 --> 1:04:48.275
I can get a little...

1:04:48.406 --> 1:04:50.408
Insane?

1:04:50.538 --> 1:04:52.540
I was gonna say aggressive.

1:04:52.671 --> 1:04:55.674
I don't get it.
What do you want from me?

1:04:55.804 --> 1:04:59.025
The same thing I wanted
since the beginning.

1:04:59.156 --> 1:05:00.809
To help you.

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:02.594
Help me by
getting out of my life.

1:05:02.724 --> 1:05:04.465
[laughs]

1:05:04.596 --> 1:05:06.511
It's a little late
for that, Mel.

1:05:06.641 --> 1:05:10.384
We work together,
your family loves me.

1:05:10.515 --> 1:05:13.953
I mean, that ship
has pretty much sailed.

1:05:14.084 --> 1:05:17.739
So if you want me to leave,
you're gonna have to make me.

1:05:17.870 --> 1:05:19.872
I said leave me alone.

1:05:20.003 --> 1:05:22.266
TINA: Mommy!

1:05:22.396 --> 1:05:24.137
MELANIE: Tina, sweetheart...
PHOEBE: Look, honey, it's okay.

1:05:24.268 --> 1:05:26.096
We were just having
a silly argument.

1:05:26.226 --> 1:05:27.924
Don't you talk to my daughter.

1:05:28.054 --> 1:05:31.753
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare Tina.

1:05:31.884 --> 1:05:34.931
I will come back when you're
a little less overwhelmed.

1:05:35.061 --> 1:05:36.323
I'm just gonna say good night.

1:05:36.454 --> 1:05:37.803
- Don't you touch her.
- TINA: Stop!

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.152
No, don't cry, honey.
Don't cry.

1:05:39.283 --> 1:05:41.589
Come back here again,
I will kill you.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.418
[Tina sobbing]

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:49.293
[locks door]

1:06:11.315 --> 1:06:13.795
What the hell did you do?

1:06:13.926 --> 1:06:15.101
- Alex, I...
- No!

1:06:15.232 --> 1:06:16.711
Let me talk.

1:06:16.842 --> 1:06:18.017
Ever since you took
this promotion,

1:06:18.148 --> 1:06:19.584
you've been like
a different person.

1:06:19.714 --> 1:06:21.716
There's something wrong
with that woman.

1:06:21.847 --> 1:06:23.631
I don't care!
I don't care.

1:06:23.762 --> 1:06:26.025
Tina said that
you laid your hands on her.

1:06:26.156 --> 1:06:27.070
You should've seen
when she told me.

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:28.593
She was shaking.

1:06:28.723 --> 1:06:30.638
I just tucked her in,
and she's fine.

1:06:30.769 --> 1:06:35.426
Oh, okay, well, I'm glad
that you think this is all fine.

1:06:51.572 --> 1:06:54.227
- Oh, you're here.
- Where's Jason?

1:06:54.358 --> 1:06:57.013
No idea. I tried calling you
the other night. Where were you?

1:06:57.143 --> 1:06:58.536
I know. Something's wrong
with my phone battery.

1:06:58.666 --> 1:07:00.016
It won't hold a charge.

1:07:00.146 --> 1:07:01.365
So what happened?

1:07:01.495 --> 1:07:03.454
Jason left me a message.

1:07:03.584 --> 1:07:05.282
He was digging up dirt
on Phoebe.

1:07:05.412 --> 1:07:06.935
And?

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:09.286
And that's not even
her real name.

1:07:09.416 --> 1:07:10.330
What?

1:07:10.461 --> 1:07:12.071
It's Lisa Nolan.

1:07:12.202 --> 1:07:14.030
What else did he find out?

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:16.206
All I know is she used to
live in some treatment center

1:07:16.336 --> 1:07:18.208
on the beach.

1:07:18.338 --> 1:07:19.774
Do you have the address?

1:07:19.905 --> 1:07:22.473
Yeah, it's, um, 32 Elm Road.

1:07:22.603 --> 1:07:26.216
I haven't told anyone else.
I wanted to wait for you.

1:07:26.346 --> 1:07:28.174
So what should we do?

1:07:28.305 --> 1:07:30.089
[sighs]
I hired her.

1:07:30.220 --> 1:07:31.699
I'll take care of this.

1:07:31.830 --> 1:07:33.223
What are you gonna do?

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:40.882
Oh!

1:07:41.013 --> 1:07:43.450
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:46.758
Call me crazy, or did I just
see you talking to Mel?

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:49.239
She isn't feeling well.

1:07:49.369 --> 1:07:51.371
So she just went home?

1:07:53.547 --> 1:07:54.983
I don't know. I guess.

1:07:55.114 --> 1:07:56.594
Uh-huh.

1:07:58.030 --> 1:07:59.597
Guess I'll just wait and see.

1:08:07.170 --> 1:08:08.040
Let's see what other lies
you've told.

1:08:08.171 --> 1:08:09.998
[line ringing]

1:08:10.129 --> 1:08:12.305
[ringtone]

1:08:15.395 --> 1:08:16.396
Hello.

1:08:16.527 --> 1:08:18.224
Hi. Kellyanne?

1:08:18.355 --> 1:08:19.921
This is Melanie Anderson.

1:08:20.052 --> 1:08:22.098
I spoke with you last week
about a Phoebe Sutton.

1:08:22.228 --> 1:08:24.056
Hmm, what do you want?

1:08:24.187 --> 1:08:25.884
Well, for starters,

1:08:26.014 --> 1:08:27.668
I just found out
that's not even her real name.

1:08:32.108 --> 1:08:33.109
Hello?

1:08:47.514 --> 1:08:48.863
Hi.

1:08:48.994 --> 1:08:51.170
Hi. Can I help you
with something?

1:08:51.301 --> 1:08:54.521
I hope so. I wanted to ask about
a woman named Phoebe Sutton.

1:08:54.652 --> 1:08:56.784
You may know her as Lisa Nolan.

1:08:56.915 --> 1:08:58.569
And who might you be?

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:02.355
I'm... I'm Melanie Anderson.
Is Lisa here?

1:09:02.486 --> 1:09:05.880
I'm afraid she hasn't stayed
with us for several weeks now.

1:09:06.011 --> 1:09:08.100
I know.

1:09:08.231 --> 1:09:10.668
Is there anything
you could tell me about Lisa?

1:09:10.798 --> 1:09:12.235
Look, with all due respect,

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:14.411
the people here
just wanna be left alone.

1:09:14.541 --> 1:09:16.282
They wanna get away
from the outside world,

1:09:16.413 --> 1:09:18.719
so they have as much time
to heal as possible.

1:09:22.070 --> 1:09:27.511
But she did have a friend here
named Kellyanne.

1:09:27.641 --> 1:09:29.556
I saw the two of them spending
quite a bit of time together.

1:09:29.687 --> 1:09:31.863
Is she here by any chance?

1:09:36.084 --> 1:09:39.392
It's a wonderful place.
Been open 25 years.

1:09:39.523 --> 1:09:42.308
I'm just so grateful we get
all of the necessary funding,

1:09:42.439 --> 1:09:45.181
and our patients have all
of the amenities they need.

1:09:45.311 --> 1:09:47.487
Great staff-to-patient ratio.

1:09:47.618 --> 1:09:49.837
Over 50 hours a month
of one-on-one time

1:09:49.968 --> 1:09:51.970
with a licensed therapist.

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:54.407
I like to think of this place
as a safe space

1:09:54.538 --> 1:09:58.106
for people to grow and learn
from their past mistakes

1:09:58.237 --> 1:10:00.631
in the most nonjudgmental
setting possible.

1:10:00.761 --> 1:10:02.241
Really help folks make it count

1:10:02.372 --> 1:10:03.982
when they get
that second chance.

1:10:04.112 --> 1:10:05.549
Or third or fourth.

1:10:05.679 --> 1:10:07.290
How do you know Lisa?

1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:09.466
She works for me.

1:10:09.596 --> 1:10:11.642
How long was she
getting treatment here?

1:10:11.772 --> 1:10:14.253
Couple months,
ever since she got out.

1:10:14.384 --> 1:10:16.951
Got out?
What, from rehab or...

1:10:17.082 --> 1:10:19.606
Please respect
our patient's privacy.

1:10:19.737 --> 1:10:21.565
Kellyanne's over there.

1:10:21.695 --> 1:10:25.264
Kellyanne, you have a visitor!

1:10:30.269 --> 1:10:32.053
Make it brief.

1:10:32.184 --> 1:10:36.057
And when you speak to her,
be very polite and very calm.

1:10:36.188 --> 1:10:37.755
Who the hell are you?

1:10:37.885 --> 1:10:39.757
I'm Melanie Anderson.

1:10:39.887 --> 1:10:41.715
You hung up on me
a half-hour ago.

1:10:41.846 --> 1:10:42.803
I did?

1:10:42.934 --> 1:10:44.065
Yeah, you did.

1:10:44.196 --> 1:10:46.242
We also spoke last week.

1:10:46.372 --> 1:10:48.331
I was asking about
Phoebe Sutton.

1:10:48.461 --> 1:10:50.376
Look, I don't even know
Phoebe Sutton.

1:10:50.507 --> 1:10:51.595
That's the truth.

1:10:51.725 --> 1:10:52.770
What about Lisa Nolan?

1:10:53.988 --> 1:10:55.729
Look, lady,

1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:58.428
I'm just here trying to
get my life together, okay?

1:10:58.558 --> 1:11:00.299
Yeah, and I'm just here trying
to keep mine together.

1:11:00.430 --> 1:11:03.084
All right, I'm done here.

1:11:03.215 --> 1:11:05.391
- Francis. Francis!
- No!

1:11:05.522 --> 1:11:07.393
- Listen.
- I don't know this woman!

1:11:07.524 --> 1:11:09.787
- Get her out of here.
- I need to know about Lisa.

1:11:09.917 --> 1:11:12.137
Please just tell me about Lisa.

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:14.574
- Tell me about Lisa, damn it.
- You need to leave now.

1:11:17.751 --> 1:11:19.579
I just need information.

1:11:19.710 --> 1:11:22.060
Please, is there anything
you can tell me about Lisa?

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:24.323
Lisa only stayed with us
for a few months,

1:11:24.454 --> 1:11:26.020
and I need to respect
her privacy.

1:11:26.151 --> 1:11:27.892
She was in jail, wasn't she?

1:11:28.022 --> 1:11:30.155
I knew it was something bad.
What was she in jail for?

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:32.157
Melanie, you know I can't
give you that information.

1:11:34.812 --> 1:11:36.248
But I don't know.

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:38.032
Maybe her parole officer
would tell you more.

1:11:38.163 --> 1:11:39.686
I'm sorry.

1:11:41.819 --> 1:11:42.994
Okay, yup.

1:11:46.171 --> 1:11:49.783
Parole office, parole office.

1:11:49.914 --> 1:11:51.132
There you go.

1:11:56.181 --> 1:11:57.138
[yelps]

1:11:57.269 --> 1:11:59.140
Don't do that!

1:11:59.271 --> 1:12:01.926
- What about what you just did?
- What?

1:12:02.056 --> 1:12:03.188
I didn't tell that lady
anything.

1:12:05.059 --> 1:12:06.844
Oh, come on.
Don't look at me like that.

1:12:06.974 --> 1:12:09.063
I did everything you said.

1:12:09.194 --> 1:12:11.457
I helped you get that damn job.

1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:17.637
I'm not afraid of you, Lisa.

1:12:17.768 --> 1:12:20.292
Why would you be?

1:12:20.423 --> 1:12:24.122
I'm just asking what you
talked to Melanie about.

1:12:24.252 --> 1:12:26.342
If you say it's nothing,
I believe you.

1:12:26.472 --> 1:12:29.997
Sorry I freaked you out.

1:12:30.128 --> 1:12:32.130
Well, I-I have a meeting.

1:12:32.260 --> 1:12:33.958
I should probably
be getting inside, so...

1:12:34.088 --> 1:12:35.481
Hey.

1:12:36.874 --> 1:12:39.311
Thanks for having my back.

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:40.443
I miss you.

1:12:41.922 --> 1:12:43.315
Oh!

1:12:47.275 --> 1:12:51.192
- [stab]
- [groans]

1:12:51.323 --> 1:12:54.152
I have to be getting
back to work anyway.

1:13:07.513 --> 1:13:09.341
Hi. Are you Officer Steiner?

1:13:10.864 --> 1:13:11.952
You one of mine?

1:13:12.083 --> 1:13:14.215
No. I've never been arrested.

1:13:14.346 --> 1:13:16.348
Keep up the good work.

1:13:16.479 --> 1:13:19.177
So why are you here?

1:13:19.307 --> 1:13:21.222
I need to talk to you
about one of your cases.

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:23.050
Sorry. Can't help you.

1:13:24.182 --> 1:13:25.444
Please, listen to me.

1:13:25.575 --> 1:13:26.750
Her name is Lisa Nolan,

1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:29.492
but I know her as Phoebe Sutton,

1:13:29.622 --> 1:13:31.885
and she is making my life
a living hell.

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:32.973
How do you mean?

1:13:36.455 --> 1:13:38.718
I hired her as my assistant.

1:13:38.849 --> 1:13:41.242
Turns out nothing on
her work résumé is even true.

1:13:41.373 --> 1:13:45.421
But it's not just work.
She's invaded my whole family.

1:13:45.551 --> 1:13:47.379
Please, I have a little girl.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.163
Is there anything
you can tell me about her?

1:13:51.209 --> 1:13:52.863
How'd you find me anyway?

1:13:52.993 --> 1:13:54.952
I was able to track Lisa
to some treatment center,

1:13:55.082 --> 1:13:56.736
but she'd already left.

1:13:56.867 --> 1:13:59.217
She had listed a Kellyanne Darcy
as a work reference.

1:13:59.347 --> 1:14:01.219
She was still there.

1:14:01.349 --> 1:14:03.961
Yeah, they were locked up
in a cell together upstate.

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:06.006
Kellyanne on a drug charge,

1:14:06.137 --> 1:14:09.096
assault and vandalism for Lisa.

1:14:09.227 --> 1:14:12.230
You have any proof she's trying
to harm you or your family?

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.058
I found a hidden camera
in my bedroom.

1:14:14.188 --> 1:14:15.276
She denies it, but...

1:14:15.407 --> 1:14:17.888
So nothing concrete.

1:14:18.018 --> 1:14:20.064
No.

1:14:20.194 --> 1:14:23.894
Look I'll ask her about it,
believe me,

1:14:24.024 --> 1:14:25.809
but if she hasn't
done anything illegal,

1:14:25.939 --> 1:14:27.419
that's about all I can do.

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:29.769
In the meanwhile,
I suggest you be careful.

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.293
Call the police as soon as
you have anything solid.

1:14:32.424 --> 1:14:34.121
By then, it'll be too late.

1:14:37.429 --> 1:14:38.691
[sighs]

1:14:38.822 --> 1:14:40.650
I remember something
about her saying

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:43.957
she was gonna look up some
family now that she was out.

1:14:44.088 --> 1:14:46.220
Yeah, this is it.

1:14:46.351 --> 1:14:47.483
She requested
a bunch of documents

1:14:47.613 --> 1:14:49.136
while she was still in lockup.

1:14:49.267 --> 1:14:50.747
Documents about what?

1:14:50.877 --> 1:14:51.965
Juvie record, chain of custody,

1:14:52.096 --> 1:14:54.141
that sort of thing.

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:55.882
Both Lisa's parents died
when she was pretty young,

1:14:56.013 --> 1:14:57.101
so she didn't have
a lot of memories

1:14:57.231 --> 1:14:59.277
from that time of her life.

1:14:59.407 --> 1:15:01.627
Mother died of cancer
when she was two,

1:15:01.758 --> 1:15:04.674
father a car accident
when she was barely four.

1:15:04.804 --> 1:15:07.503
Oh, God, that's awful.

1:15:07.633 --> 1:15:10.680
Yeah, life's a little rougher
on some of us then others.

1:15:10.810 --> 1:15:14.205
Just ask most of the people
that have sat in that seat.

1:15:14.335 --> 1:15:18.252
Looks like her father remarried
about a year before he died.

1:15:18.383 --> 1:15:19.515
Stepmother didn't keep Lisa
too long.

1:15:19.645 --> 1:15:21.081
She was pretty young herself.

1:15:21.212 --> 1:15:24.389
Sent her to live
with her grandparents,

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:27.566
but wound up in the foster care
system shortly after that.

1:15:31.135 --> 1:15:32.963
One of the homes turned out
to be pretty damn abusive.

1:15:35.139 --> 1:15:37.358
I had no idea.

1:15:37.489 --> 1:15:39.317
What about the stepmom?

1:15:39.447 --> 1:15:41.667
Maybe I could talk to her.
What's her name?

1:15:42.973 --> 1:15:44.931
Carol. Carol Graham.

1:15:56.073 --> 1:15:57.640
[sighs]

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:22.795
[phone vibrating]

1:16:22.926 --> 1:16:24.667
Mom, I don't know when you're
getting back from your trip,

1:16:24.797 --> 1:16:26.538
but you gotta call me
as soon as you can.

1:16:26.669 --> 1:16:28.192
Something's wrong.

1:16:37.027 --> 1:16:38.855
Hello, Carol.

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:42.119
What are you doing here?
How'd you get in?

1:16:42.249 --> 1:16:44.730
This has been my house
for over a week now.

1:16:44.861 --> 1:16:46.210
Who are you?

1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:48.691
You don't even recognize me,
do you?

1:16:48.821 --> 1:16:50.997
Figures.

1:16:52.433 --> 1:16:55.393
Oh, my God. Lisa?

1:17:00.528 --> 1:17:02.182
[muffled screams]

1:17:05.838 --> 1:17:08.711
[ringing]

1:17:08.841 --> 1:17:10.190
Hello.

1:17:10.321 --> 1:17:12.976
Hey, boss, where have you been?

1:17:13.106 --> 1:17:15.674
I haven't seen you all day.

1:17:15.805 --> 1:17:18.024
I know, Lisa.
I know everything.

1:17:18.155 --> 1:17:20.244
Oh, well, actually,
that's a relief.

1:17:20.374 --> 1:17:22.942
So I guess you'll be coming home
to discuss it then.

1:17:23.073 --> 1:17:25.249
Huh, sister?

1:17:25.379 --> 1:17:27.686
Stepsister.

1:17:27.817 --> 1:17:29.688
Wait, wait, what do you mean?
Where are you?

1:17:29.819 --> 1:17:32.256
Exactly where I said.
Home.

1:17:33.823 --> 1:17:35.302
Leave them alone.
This is between us.

1:17:35.433 --> 1:17:36.652
You got that right.

1:17:36.782 --> 1:17:38.044
And when you get here,

1:17:38.175 --> 1:17:39.567
you better be
on your best behavior.

1:17:39.698 --> 1:17:41.308
No cops.

1:17:41.439 --> 1:17:44.268
I see one black and white,
and all bets are off.

1:17:44.398 --> 1:17:45.399
Bye!

1:17:50.622 --> 1:17:52.755
[line ringing]

1:17:52.885 --> 1:17:54.017
Alex can't come
to the phone right now.

1:17:54.147 --> 1:17:55.235
Can I take a message?

1:17:55.366 --> 1:17:57.585
Lisa, I swear to God...

1:17:57.716 --> 1:17:59.587
He's spending quality time
with his family.

1:17:59.718 --> 1:18:00.980
Leave them alone!
If you hurt them...

1:18:01.111 --> 1:18:02.242
Bye.

1:18:09.032 --> 1:18:10.250
PHOEBE: Sorry about that.

1:18:10.381 --> 1:18:11.338
Just had to make
a quick phone call.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:13.210
- Hey.
- What's up?

1:18:13.340 --> 1:18:16.213
Look, I just want to
apologize again for yesterday.

1:18:16.343 --> 1:18:18.171
Oh, in Mel's defense,

1:18:18.302 --> 1:18:21.740
she has been going through
a lot of changes lately.

1:18:21.871 --> 1:18:24.961
And like I said, we totally
smoked the peace pipe.

1:18:25.091 --> 1:18:27.833
Do you think I would come over
if I thought she'd mind?

1:18:27.964 --> 1:18:31.010
Oh, that's great. I guess
I should probably call her.

1:18:31.141 --> 1:18:32.882
If I had my phone.

1:18:33.012 --> 1:18:35.841
Oh, I just talked to her.
She is on her way home.

1:18:35.972 --> 1:18:37.234
Let's play.

1:18:37.364 --> 1:18:39.018
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1:18:43.675 --> 1:18:45.242
Are you coming, Daddy?

1:18:45.372 --> 1:18:47.157
Yeah, come on, Alex.

1:18:47.287 --> 1:18:48.506
Yeah, yeah.

1:18:51.639 --> 1:18:53.554
All right, who's up?

1:18:53.685 --> 1:18:55.034
- Your turn.
- Okay.

1:19:08.656 --> 1:19:10.920
[door opens, closes]

1:19:11.050 --> 1:19:13.444
Well, look who it is.

1:19:13.574 --> 1:19:15.881
We were just wondering
when you were gonna show up.

1:19:16.012 --> 1:19:17.143
Here I am.

1:19:17.274 --> 1:19:18.318
Hi, Mommy!

1:19:18.449 --> 1:19:20.103
Hey, sweetie.

1:19:20.233 --> 1:19:21.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:19:21.191 --> 1:19:23.323
How are you?

1:19:23.454 --> 1:19:24.672
Good?

1:19:24.803 --> 1:19:26.239
Of course.

1:19:26.370 --> 1:19:29.112
I'm glad you two made up.

1:19:29.242 --> 1:19:32.724
Yeah. It's like we're sisters.

1:19:32.855 --> 1:19:34.682
So whose turn is it?

1:19:34.813 --> 1:19:36.510
Phoebe's.

1:19:36.641 --> 1:19:39.383
You're right.
It is my turn.

1:19:39.513 --> 1:19:43.387
I almost forgot.
I need to download you in

1:19:43.517 --> 1:19:45.476
on that conference call
with Barbara.

1:19:45.606 --> 1:19:48.827
You know,
I actually just saw her.

1:19:48.958 --> 1:19:51.308
I had a feeling.
Sorry, honey,

1:19:51.438 --> 1:19:53.789
but we just need to sort out
this stuff right now.

1:19:53.919 --> 1:19:56.704
Oh, if we must.

1:19:56.835 --> 1:19:58.184
Boo!

1:19:58.315 --> 1:20:00.186
Hey, listen to your mommy.

1:20:00.317 --> 1:20:01.971
You don't want
to be put in timeout.

1:20:02.101 --> 1:20:03.537
I've been put in timeout before,

1:20:03.668 --> 1:20:07.411
and let me tell you,
it really sucks.

1:20:09.805 --> 1:20:12.198
Would you like a big banana
split to make up for it?

1:20:12.329 --> 1:20:14.113
Yeah!

1:20:14.244 --> 1:20:16.376
Alex, would you mind
grabbing a little snack?

1:20:16.507 --> 1:20:18.248
Uh, yeah, sure.

1:20:18.378 --> 1:20:20.250
You guys sure everything
is cool with you two?

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:24.036
Absolutely. We just need
to get this over with.

1:20:24.167 --> 1:20:26.691
- Sure, okay.
- Okay, babe.

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.656
Something tells me

1:20:35.787 --> 1:20:39.835
you don't wanna talk about
Barbara from Yowsers.

1:20:39.965 --> 1:20:42.489
What gave you that idea, Phoebe?

1:20:42.620 --> 1:20:45.188
Now, I'm not sure
if someone as lucky as you

1:20:45.318 --> 1:20:47.494
can be aware of this,

1:20:47.625 --> 1:20:51.890
but there is a very thin line
between pleasure and pain.

1:20:52.021 --> 1:20:57.330
It's that same line
that separates the two of us.

1:20:57.461 --> 1:21:01.334
See, you got all the joy,
and I got all the hurt.

1:21:02.901 --> 1:21:05.599
But tables were
built to be turned.

1:21:05.730 --> 1:21:09.473
Lisa, I feel really horrible
for what happened to you.

1:21:09.603 --> 1:21:11.083
- I do.
- No, you don't.

1:21:12.519 --> 1:21:15.261
Not yet, but you will.

1:21:15.392 --> 1:21:17.002
Very soon.

1:21:17.133 --> 1:21:19.222
So what happens now?

1:21:19.352 --> 1:21:22.790
You get rid of me and then what?

1:21:22.921 --> 1:21:24.880
Alex and Tina
and Sam and everyone,

1:21:25.010 --> 1:21:28.318
they just forget I existed
and accept you in my place?

1:21:28.448 --> 1:21:30.537
[scoffs]
That's your plan?

1:21:30.668 --> 1:21:33.758
Why is that so crazy?

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:37.283
I mean, I'm the one that got
Sam the Yowsers account,

1:21:37.414 --> 1:21:40.504
I'm the one that made Tina's
birthday party super special,

1:21:40.634 --> 1:21:43.202
and I can make Alex sweat
in the dead of winter

1:21:43.333 --> 1:21:45.552
just by touching his arm.

1:21:45.683 --> 1:21:49.730
You see, I'm better at
being you than you ever were.

1:21:49.861 --> 1:21:51.689
It's my life!

1:21:51.819 --> 1:21:53.821
Then I guess this is what
you would call a life hack.

1:21:53.952 --> 1:21:56.433
And do you wanna know
how I do it?

1:21:56.563 --> 1:21:59.740
I'm gonna tell everyone you
tried to kill me with this gun.

1:21:59.871 --> 1:22:03.788
Yeah. And you gave me no choice,
but I had to take it away and...

1:22:03.919 --> 1:22:06.573
- [cocks gun]
- like I said,

1:22:06.704 --> 1:22:08.358
you gave me no choice.

1:22:08.488 --> 1:22:09.315
No one's gonna believe that.

1:22:09.446 --> 1:22:11.535
[laughs]

1:22:11.665 --> 1:22:14.451
Are you so sure about that?

1:22:14.581 --> 1:22:17.933
Everyone has seen you
attacking me at work,

1:22:18.063 --> 1:22:19.456
yelling at me.

1:22:19.586 --> 1:22:21.675
Your own family has seen it.

1:22:21.806 --> 1:22:26.550
It's clear you've been under
a lot of extra pressure lately.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:28.900
You snapped.

1:22:29.031 --> 1:22:30.815
It happens.

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:34.166
It's about to happen very soon.

1:22:34.297 --> 1:22:36.429
No, no, please.
Tina will...

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:38.475
Will be just fine.

1:22:38.605 --> 1:22:41.521
Her Aunt Lisa's gonna take
super good care of her.

1:22:41.652 --> 1:22:43.349
Alex too.

1:22:44.568 --> 1:22:46.613
Please, I can help you.

1:22:46.744 --> 1:22:48.398
Oh, and what would you do?

1:22:48.528 --> 1:22:50.443
We'll call my mom, okay?
We'll call Carol.

1:22:50.574 --> 1:22:53.490
- We'll make sense of all this.
- And what would she say?

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:56.058
"I'm so sorry for running off

1:22:56.188 --> 1:22:58.451
and leaving a terrified
little girl behind

1:22:58.582 --> 1:23:01.280
to be abused
by gross strangers"?

1:23:01.411 --> 1:23:03.369
Yeah, she would.

1:23:05.023 --> 1:23:08.940
That bitch is already sorry.
Trust me.

1:23:09.071 --> 1:23:10.637
What?

1:23:10.768 --> 1:23:12.204
You killed her?

1:23:12.335 --> 1:23:14.990
- She killed me first.
- No!

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:17.383
A long time ago.

1:23:17.514 --> 1:23:20.821
And now I'm making
everything right!

1:23:20.952 --> 1:23:26.349
The right life,
the right job, the right mommy.

1:23:26.479 --> 1:23:28.742
More like the wrong mommy!

1:23:28.873 --> 1:23:29.787
Mom!

1:23:31.658 --> 1:23:33.356
Oh, thank God you're okay.

1:23:36.446 --> 1:23:38.187
CAROL: I know her.

1:23:38.317 --> 1:23:40.058
I know. So do I.

1:23:43.366 --> 1:23:44.541
Tina!

1:23:44.671 --> 1:23:46.978
No, she's okay, she's okay.

1:23:47.109 --> 1:23:50.808
[sirens approaching]

1:23:50.938 --> 1:23:52.505
Women helping women.

1:23:59.077 --> 1:24:01.906
I can't believe
I have a stepsister.

1:24:03.777 --> 1:24:05.431
This has just all been so crazy.

1:24:05.562 --> 1:24:08.826
I mean, she tried
to steal my life,

1:24:08.956 --> 1:24:10.871
everything I love:

1:24:11.002 --> 1:24:13.918
my daughter,
my husband, my career.

1:24:16.790 --> 1:24:21.969
With the cards she was dealt,
compared to mine,

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:23.841
I guess I can't
really blame her.

1:24:23.971 --> 1:24:26.539
No, you can blame me.
No, this is my fault.

1:24:26.670 --> 1:24:28.324
You didn't know.

1:24:28.454 --> 1:24:30.021
Oh, honey.

1:24:30.152 --> 1:24:34.547
I surrendered our daughter
to her grandparents,

1:24:34.678 --> 1:24:37.724
who I thought wanted her.

1:24:39.030 --> 1:24:41.424
You were really young.

1:24:41.554 --> 1:24:46.951
I was so overwhelmed with
the idea of raising her alone,

1:24:47.082 --> 1:24:52.261
I really thought that I would
be the worst thing for her.

1:24:52.391 --> 1:24:55.220
I had no idea that this
situation with her grandparents

1:24:55.351 --> 1:24:59.224
would end up being so temporary.

1:24:59.355 --> 1:25:02.009
If I'd known, I...

1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:03.750
[sighs]

1:25:03.881 --> 1:25:05.752
I was just selfish.

1:25:05.883 --> 1:25:09.365
Mom, don't. Come on.

1:25:09.495 --> 1:25:11.758
Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm gonna
get Tina off to school.

1:25:11.889 --> 1:25:13.369
Yeah, thanks, babe.

1:25:13.499 --> 1:25:15.414
Sure. Let me know
if you need anything.

1:25:15.545 --> 1:25:18.069
Oh, we're just catching up
on some stuff.

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.289
Right.
Okay, I'll get out of your way.

1:25:20.419 --> 1:25:22.856
Goodbye, Mommy.
Goodbye, Grandma.

1:25:22.987 --> 1:25:26.425
There she is!
Give me a hug.

1:25:26.556 --> 1:25:28.079
What would you like
for dinner tonight?

1:25:28.210 --> 1:25:29.124
Anything you want.

1:25:29.254 --> 1:25:30.560
- Anything?
- Anything.

1:25:30.690 --> 1:25:32.170
Grilled cheese and pickles.

1:25:32.301 --> 1:25:33.563
Eww!
