10:25.712 --> 10:27.191
now I'll never
unload it.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.759
I'm sorry to hear about
your husband, Mrs. Johnson.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.718
Yeah, thanks.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.636
Great, more bills.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.637
We done?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.465
I guess so, yeah.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.511
Thanks.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.603
She is one
angry screw.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.518
Huh?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.434
You know, a woman
with a bad temper.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
Shrew, Ziva.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.132
Oh.
[chuckles]

10:55.176 --> 10:56.656
Hold on a
second.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.092
Hey! Excuse me.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.790
Special Agent DiNozzo,
David, NCIS.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.226
Can I ask you a question?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.445
Sure.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.012
Have you ever delivered
any mail

11:05.055 --> 11:06.927
to the Johnson house
from Korea?

11:06.970 --> 11:08.711
No. I'd remember that.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.626
You sure?
Yeah.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.497
Well, they have been
receiving letters

11:12.541 --> 11:13.716
from Switzerland lately.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.676
Good-looking stamps.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.765
Thank you.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.030
Switzerland.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.865
[car door opens and closes]

11:31.908 --> 11:33.910
[distant dog barking]

11:36.173 --> 11:38.219
[knock at door]

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
It's open, Duck.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.700
[door creaks open]

11:41.744 --> 11:44.747
Thanks for letting me drop by.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.271
Yeah, you sounded
troubled on the phone.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.925
[chuckling]:
Oh, really?

11:48.969 --> 11:51.362
No, nothing serious.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.147
Bringing work home?

11:53.190 --> 11:56.498
Yeah, hard copy
of Lieutenant Ramsey's OQR.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.153
Survived two tours in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.419
He has a Purple Heart,
has a Bronze Star.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.424
Gets killed by an American
terrorist on a U.S. ship.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.295
It's tragic.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.949
And senseless.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.866
Yeah.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.825
Want a cup of tea?

12:18.868 --> 12:23.220
Jethro, this is tea dust.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.483
I prefer tea leaves,
steeped in boiling water

12:25.527 --> 12:27.224
in a proper pot.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.661
[chuckles]
But thank you all the same.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.490
What's on your mind?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.883
Well, there
have been

12:33.927 --> 12:37.582
a number of changes in my
life the last few years,

12:37.626 --> 12:40.803
not the least of which
was Mother's passing.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.633
Then selling her house,
moving into town.

12:44.676 --> 12:49.812
I chose not to tell
anyone this, but...

12:49.856 --> 12:52.467
I've come into rather
a lot of money.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.599
Far more than I
will ever need.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.950
I-I didn't say
anything to anyone

12:56.993 --> 13:00.344
because I find that people
tend to treat you differently

13:00.388 --> 13:01.998
if they think you're rich.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.566
Why are you telling me now?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.787
Because I trust you,

13:07.830 --> 13:10.659
and I'd like to ask a favor.

13:10.702 --> 13:14.184
I'm redoing my will.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.796
It-it's still being drafted,

13:16.839 --> 13:20.974
and I have some decisions
to make, but...

13:21.017 --> 13:25.630
well, I'd like you to be
the executor of my estate.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.763
Me, Ducky?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.069
Mm-hmm.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.940
Are you sure about that?
Don't you want a lawyer?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.637
No, I'd rather have a friend

13:32.681 --> 13:35.205
that I can trust
rather than someone

13:35.249 --> 13:37.991
who hardly knows me.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.867
Yeah, I'd be honored.

13:58.707 --> 13:59.664
McGee.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.665
Hey, boss.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.710
Dr. Mallard.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.059
You feeling
any better?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.234
Oh, much better.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.235
The ship's
stopped rocking.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.497
Where are my bodies?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.195
Haven't moved them.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.631
This is
Lieutenant Ramsey.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.893
The civilian's remains

14:10.937 --> 14:13.156
are in the machine
room, just aft.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.680
You find anything
in the civilian's quarters?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.291
I haven't gotten to it yet.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.640
Spent the night in sick bay.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.685
Didn't want
to contaminate the scene.Okay.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.513
Take, uh, Tony and Ziva
with you, will you?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.732
Where are they?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.125
TONY:
That's the whole thing--

14:25.168 --> 14:26.343
James Bond is fantasy.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.302
I'll be with Ducky
and the arson specialists.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.260
[Tony whistling jaunty melody]

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
[grunts] McGee.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.089
Got a little present for you.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.961
What?
Barf bags.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
[sighs]

14:41.097 --> 14:43.186
Wow.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.928
Has Abby finalized plans for
Palmer's bachelor party?

14:45.972 --> 14:47.060
Uh, don't know.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.278
She hasn't talked.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.758
She's keeping
everything under wraps.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.325
I wouldn't
worry, though.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.066
Abby would not
disappoint us.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.197
What is this
American thing--

14:54.241 --> 14:56.156
grown men acting
like fraternity boys?

14:56.199 --> 14:58.158
I do not understand.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.289
What's not to
understand?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.464
You got your booze,
your strippers.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.726
Total debauchery.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.511
Abby would never plan
something like that.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.340
[chuckles softly]

15:06.383 --> 15:07.994
Clotrimazole.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.691
Poor Abbott has jock itch.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.345
Not anymore.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.869
McGEE: Hey, Ziva, the weekend's
coming up, and we're on alert.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
Doesn't that blow
your plans for...

15:17.090 --> 15:19.005
Seriously?

15:19.048 --> 15:21.181
I mean, does
everybody but me

15:21.224 --> 15:23.052
know your plans
for this weekend?

15:23.096 --> 15:24.532
Oh, look at this.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.055
It's got a Swiss stamp.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.317
What does that mean?

15:31.582 --> 15:32.975
Korean.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.368
Korean?

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
This connects the attacks.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.112
PARK:
It's gibberish.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.157
What do you mean?

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
It's a meaningless
collection of Korean script.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.291
These are all symbols

15:44.334 --> 15:45.770
from the Hangul
alphabet.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.556
However, their arrangement
forms no words or sentences.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.428
Could it be a dialect
or regional language?

15:51.472 --> 15:52.777
I showed it to a professor

15:52.821 --> 15:54.214
of Korean language and culture
at Georgetown.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.303
He assured me
it made absolutely no sense.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.609
It's a code.I thought the same thing.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.872
I sent a copy
to our cryptographers.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.396
Haven't heard anything.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.572
I'll contact them
as soon as we finish here.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.269
I've talked to State
and the CIA.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.923
Their North Korean experts
gave no indication

16:07.967 --> 16:10.186
of that country's involvement
in the attacks.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.796
Actually,
under their new leadership,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
they've been playing nice.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.713
For the moment.

16:15.757 --> 16:19.500
So, if it's not North Korea,
who are we dealing with?

16:27.508 --> 16:29.379
GIBBS: What do we
know about Abbott?

16:29.423 --> 16:31.729
Tobey "No Middle Name"
Abbott, 29.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.949
Single, born
in Norwalk, Connecticut.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.298
No police or
military record.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
Attended Rensselaer
Polytechnical Institute

16:37.300 --> 16:38.736
in Troy, New York.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.434
Nothing distinguishing.
Had three jobs

16:40.477 --> 16:43.089
before joining Norton Turbine
as a mechanic a year ago.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
That's it?That's it.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.309
I'll let you know. Thanks.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.746
Not so fast, Ms. David.
I just got off

16:48.790 --> 16:50.966
the phone with Abbott's
high school advisor.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.228
Had his heart
set on going

16:52.272 --> 16:53.795
to the Naval Academy,
but got rejected.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.057
Abbott wanted it so bad,

16:55.101 --> 16:56.537
he spent the year
after high school

16:56.580 --> 16:58.191
attending a service academy
prep school.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.366
And he got rejected again.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.281
You got it.Think he holds a grudge?

17:01.324 --> 17:04.414
Talk to Abbott's supervisor
at Norton Turbine.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.463
TONY:
Oh, yeah.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.291
Ducky dropped that off
a little while ago.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.471
Why would he
give you tea leaves?

17:21.257 --> 17:23.303
Tony can be
so transparent.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.695
You think?

17:24.739 --> 17:27.394
Yeah. He came down here
asking me about thermite,

17:27.437 --> 17:29.439
but, really, he was fishing.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.701
He was trying to find out

17:30.745 --> 17:32.268
what Ziva had planned
for the weekend.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.443
You didn't tell him, did you?

17:33.487 --> 17:35.358
Of course not.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.230
It's driving him crazy.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.797
Yeah, but it's just
Pilates weekend

17:39.841 --> 17:41.495
with her landlady.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.192
Yeah, but that's
not what Tony's

17:43.236 --> 17:44.454
dirty little mind
is thinking.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.500
Hey. We getting anywhere?

17:46.543 --> 17:47.588
Um...

17:47.631 --> 17:49.851
the arson inspectors
sent me residue

17:49.894 --> 17:52.245
of the accelerant used
on the fire aboard the Brewer.

17:52.288 --> 17:55.161
Major Mass Spec is
back on his game.

17:55.204 --> 17:58.338
He just I.D.'d the residue
as the exact same mixture

17:58.381 --> 18:00.514
of thermite and fire retardant

18:00.557 --> 18:02.298
that Detective King
and I identified

18:02.342 --> 18:03.560
in the other fires.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.649
Same signature;
it's a different arsonist.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.869
Why did it do
more damage to the ship?

18:07.912 --> 18:09.262
Have a theory, boss.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.480
Let me show you.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.092
On the deck directly below
the machine room

18:13.135 --> 18:14.963
is the magazine locker,
and it contains

18:15.006 --> 18:17.183
thousands of pounds
worth of explosives.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.532
Now, there's no way that Abbott

18:18.575 --> 18:20.403
could have gained access
to that area.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.013
His plan was to ignite
the slow-burning,

18:22.057 --> 18:23.145
intensely hot
thermite fire

18:23.189 --> 18:24.668
in the area just above.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.105
McGEE:
And when it burned

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
through the deck
and hit the magazine below,

18:28.150 --> 18:29.760
the ship would have been
severely damaged,

18:29.804 --> 18:30.805
maybe even sunk.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.198
Why didn't that happen?

18:32.241 --> 18:34.330
This is a file photo
of the machine room.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.550
And here is the
point of ignition.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.291
Now, what Abbott
didn't realize was

18:38.334 --> 18:41.381
these three tanks contained
highly flammable material.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.166
Before the fire could
burn below as intended,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.168
the tanks ignited and
caused the explosion

18:46.212 --> 18:47.822
that killed him and
Lieutenant Ramsey.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.302
Gibbs, did you see

18:49.345 --> 18:51.304
the John Wayne movie,
Hellfighters?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.349
Yeah.
The Duke played Red Adair,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.177
the oil well firefighter.Okay.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.613
What happened on the ship

18:56.657 --> 18:58.746
is exactly what happened
when Red used the dynamite.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.443
The explosion
created a vacuum,

19:00.487 --> 19:02.184
and it sucked out
all the oxygen

19:02.228 --> 19:03.359
and extinguished
the fire.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.839
Lucky.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
We getting anywhere
decoding the Korean document?

19:07.233 --> 19:10.410
Um, no, but it did come
from the same printer

19:10.453 --> 19:13.500
and it's the same paper
as the shredded document

19:13.543 --> 19:15.023
that we found
at Bruce Johnson's.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
Dusted it and
the envelope for prints.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.287
Only got Abbott's.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.159
We also found DNA
on the flap

19:20.202 --> 19:21.377
of the envelope
where someone licked it.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.118
Who? You got a name?No.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
I ran it through
active military

19:24.859 --> 19:26.513
and known felons
and Interpol.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.297
Nothing yet,
but I'll keep trying.

19:31.779 --> 19:34.085
You're welcome.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.916
MAN:
I was the one who interviewed

19:38.960 --> 19:41.005
and hired Tobey Abbott
little over a year ago.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.529
ZIVA: What exactly
was he doing

19:42.572 --> 19:44.357
for your company
aboard the USS Brewer?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.663
We did some repairs
to the ship's power plant.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.883
It's customary to
send a mechanic

19:48.926 --> 19:50.885
to make sure everything's
working properly

19:50.928 --> 19:52.887
under operating
conditions.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.106
Do you know what
caused the explosion?

19:55.150 --> 19:56.978
Still under investigation.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.415
Why did you select Abbott to go?

19:59.459 --> 20:00.547
He was a good
mechanic.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.723
Not our best;
more than adequate.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.508
To be honest, he lobbied
for the assignment.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.206
Really?
Careful.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.381
[horn honking]

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
I usually have
to beg my guys

20:10.426 --> 20:12.341
to go out to sea
on Navy contracts.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.603
They're not
pleasure cruises.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.084
You can be stuck
on the ship for weeks

20:16.127 --> 20:17.520
waiting until it
reaches a port.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.957
Did Abbott say
why he wanted to go?
No.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.568
My guess--

20:21.611 --> 20:23.961
unlike most of the
others, he was single.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.441
Wasn't leaving
a family.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.617
Plus there's a small
pay incentive.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.489
You know who he hung with?
Anyone at work?

20:29.532 --> 20:30.751
Tobey could
be moody.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.143
Pretty much kept to himself.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.536
Well, if you think
of anything else,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.538
would you give me call?Sure.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.717
Did Tobey Abbott
speak Korean?

20:41.675 --> 20:44.808
Uh, don't know,
but I seriously doubt it.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.376
Thanks.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.988
DUCKY:
I found traces

20:51.032 --> 20:53.295
of a substance
under Mr. Abbott's fingernails

20:53.339 --> 20:55.906
that Abby identifies
as the same combination

20:55.950 --> 20:58.082
of thermite and fire retardant

20:58.126 --> 21:00.520
that's coated
Bruce Johnson's body.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.304
One more thing
connecting the fires.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.566
Yeah.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.742
The cause of Lieutenant
Ramsey's death

21:05.786 --> 21:07.483
was blunt force trauma.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.051
He would have
survived his burns,

21:10.094 --> 21:12.183
but with the force
of the explosion,

21:12.227 --> 21:14.708
he fractured his skull
on a bulkhead.

21:14.751 --> 21:18.364
Oh, I found this

21:18.407 --> 21:20.714
in one of his pockets.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.894
Wife's a kid herself, Duck.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.722
[cell phone buzzing]

21:32.682 --> 21:35.294
I got to go.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.779
You have beautiful children.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.830
I can't believe
you're still with Gibbs.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.049
Has he, has he
mellowed with age?

21:52.093 --> 21:54.748
What do you think?

21:54.791 --> 21:57.533
Last time I spoke with him was
right after Mike Franks died.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.057
He didn't want to talk about it.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.363
He keeps a lot inside.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.582
Yeah.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.584
What's he building
in his basement now?

22:04.627 --> 22:05.672
I don't know.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.195
Haven't been down there
in a while.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.457
Down where, DiNozzo?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.677
Hi-ya, boss.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.591
Special Agent Burley.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.027
You got something for us?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.071
Oh, yeah.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.377
Where are you?

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
Naples, Italy.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.859
I came here to perform
a port-threat assessment

22:18.902 --> 22:20.600
prior to the arrival
of the aircraft carrier,

22:20.643 --> 22:21.601
the Benjamin Franklin.

22:21.644 --> 22:22.863
It's due in tomorrow.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.647
And then I got the alert.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.562
The Benjamin Franklin'son
the list of marked vessels.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.781
You find something?

22:27.824 --> 22:29.217
I was conducting a search

22:29.260 --> 22:30.827
of the warehouse that serves
as a collection point

22:30.871 --> 22:33.352
for goods and equipment that are
going to resupply the ship.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.702
Found an explosive device
hidden on a palette.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.746
What kind of device?

22:36.790 --> 22:38.966
Thermite,
with a magnesium fuse.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.185
Just like described
in the alert.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.710
A nuclear aircraft carrier.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.757
They're upping the stakes.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.288
[whistling]

22:57.332 --> 22:59.116
Andiamo, bambina!

22:59.160 --> 23:00.727
Dove? Gear up.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.859
We're leaving for Naples.

23:02.903 --> 23:03.860
[laughs]

23:03.904 --> 23:05.079
Naples, Italy?

23:05.122 --> 23:06.385
Si.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.690
I'm going home
to grab some clothes.

23:07.734 --> 23:08.909
You should do the same.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.650
We're hopping
a military flight

23:10.693 --> 23:11.912
from Andrews Air Force Base.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.653
This one of
your practical jokes?

23:13.696 --> 23:15.350
Nope. Gibbs' orders.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.525
[elevator bell dings]

23:20.616 --> 23:22.575
It's a good thing you canceled
your Pilates weekend.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.793
Who told you?

23:23.837 --> 23:25.055
I'm a very
special agent.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.623
I have my ways.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.066
[elevator bell dings]

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
Hey!

23:42.508 --> 23:44.205
Come on.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.293
Wake up.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.600
Get up.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.731
[grunts]

23:48.775 --> 23:50.820
I've got coffee.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.605
I've got Danish.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.563
What do you got?

23:54.607 --> 23:55.782
Gibbs.

23:55.825 --> 23:58.088
You're not mad at us
for waking you up?

23:58.132 --> 23:59.481
Depends what
you found.

23:59.525 --> 24:03.485
Boss, we broke the code
on the Korean message.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.357
It took us a long time because
we and the cryptologists

24:06.401 --> 24:08.359
thought that it was gonna be
really complicated,

24:08.403 --> 24:09.665
but it wasn't.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.188
It was actually easy.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.670
Using a Korean-Hangul
word processing program,

24:14.714 --> 24:16.803
the person who
sent the message

24:16.846 --> 24:19.849
typed the words into
an English-alphabet keyboard.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.982
But it was printed out

24:22.025 --> 24:23.505
in Hangul script.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.725
I'll show you the first line
of the document.

24:25.768 --> 24:32.471
"Place the thermite device
on the 0-3 deck."

24:32.514 --> 24:36.475
Those characters don't form
Korean words, Gibbs.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.782
So it would be meaningless to
anyone that was reading Korean.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.219
Reversing the process,
decodes the message.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.831
Uncoded, the rest of it
instructed Abbott

24:44.874 --> 24:47.616
when, where and how to attack
the U.S.S. Brewer.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.010
Don't suppose he was
dumb enough to sign it?

24:53.056 --> 24:55.668
Any luck with the DNA
on the envelope?

24:55.711 --> 24:58.409
Unfortunately, no.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.419
Ooh.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.953
[tires screech, horn honks]

25:32.443 --> 25:33.836
BURLEY:
Hey, guys.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.969
Good to see you again, DiNozzo.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.187
Hey, man,
how are you?

25:37.231 --> 25:39.015
Hi. Special Agent
Ziva David.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.190
Agent Burley.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.191
It's a pleasure.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.453
Stan, please.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.673
Welcome to Napoli,
the home of Mount Vesuvius,

25:44.717 --> 25:46.849
pizza and romance.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.242
[chuckles]I got it, Tony.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.026
Heard a lot about you, Stan.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.027
Uh-oh. From who?

25:51.071 --> 25:52.594
Abby. All good.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
Ah, she never says
anything bad about anyone.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.858
I love that woman.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.207
When'd you get here?

25:57.251 --> 25:59.166
Last week. I was enjoying
the weather and cuisine

25:59.209 --> 26:00.559
until we were put on alert.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.212
I see the Benjamin Franklin
has arrived.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.258
Yeah, it dropped anchor
about an hour ago.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.870
So, you're the senior
field agent in charge.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.090
What's the game plan, Stan?

26:10.133 --> 26:11.918
The palette's still
in the warehouse.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.094
Thermite's been replaced with
an inert, look-alike substance.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.139
It'll be barged out to the ship
in a couple hours

26:16.183 --> 26:17.445
and put in the cargo bay.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.882
The three of us will
board the ship, undercover,

26:19.926 --> 26:21.884
as Navy personnel
joining the deployment.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.583
Let me help you with that, Ziva.

26:24.626 --> 26:28.543
We've got a water taxi, it's
gonna take us out to the ship.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.892
We're going to stake out
the cargo bay

26:29.936 --> 26:31.241
and wait to see
who comes for the thermite.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.765
Yeah, and there's over
5,000 onboard,

26:32.808 --> 26:34.593
so we're looking for
a needle in a haystack.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.638
Fire on the Brewerwas
started by a civilian.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.726
A tech rep, I know.

26:37.770 --> 26:38.988
I read the bulletin
from headquarters.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.164
I checked,
there are 32 civilians

26:41.208 --> 26:42.862
on the Benjamin Franklin
right now.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.515
The problem is,
if we question them,

26:44.559 --> 26:46.909
we'll spook whoever it is
before they go for the bait.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.956
After you, Ziva.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.397
Stay classy, Stan.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.572
[laughs]

26:57.616 --> 26:59.095
Andiamo.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.141
[boat engine revving]

27:14.328 --> 27:15.285
Pardon me, sir.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.330
Morning, Jethro.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.200
Hey, morning, Duck.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.680
Something happen?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.116
No, false alarm.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.553
Aboard a missile frigate off
the coast of Diego Garcia.

27:22.597 --> 27:26.296
Ah. I just released Ramsey's
body for burial at Arlington.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.256
A fully executed
copy of my will.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.867
Besides a couple of
bequeaths to a nephew

27:31.911 --> 27:35.001
in Scotland and my
good friends at NCIS,

27:35.044 --> 27:37.003
I'm leaving the bulk of
my estate to charity.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.308
That's nice.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.484
I was really struck
by that photograph of

27:40.528 --> 27:43.836
the young lieutenant with
his wife and children.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.012
Yeah, I was, too.
I sent her a note last night.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.710
I was struggling with the
decision as to where the money

27:48.754 --> 27:49.885
would do the
most good--

27:49.929 --> 27:51.974
there are so many
worthy charities.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.628
I had been considering

27:53.672 --> 27:55.804
the Marine Corps
Scholarship Foundation.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.111
They do so much good for
Marine Corps families.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.678
They give them
the means

27:59.721 --> 28:01.114
to send their kids to college.

28:01.157 --> 28:04.160
Seeing Lieutenant
Ramsey's young children

28:04.204 --> 28:05.988
just made the decision for me.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.294
Yeah, that's nice.

28:07.337 --> 28:08.774
Real nice, Duck.

28:08.817 --> 28:09.731
Oorah.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.777
Oorah.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.095
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

28:41.328 --> 28:42.938
[quietly]:
Got a bogey.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.463
About time.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.603
Getting warmer.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.390
Standing in front of the hatch.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.358
Hi.

29:11.401 --> 29:12.925
Afraid you weren't
gonna show.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.535
[chuckles]
You kidding?

29:14.578 --> 29:16.711
MAN:
Been thinking
about you all day.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.712
Did you miss me?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.888
Come on, let's go.
[giggles]

29:19.932 --> 29:20.976
Hmm.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.195
False alarm.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.067
Two young seamen
anxious to parallel park.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.416
[chuckles]

29:26.460 --> 29:28.897
Busting them is not
our problem at the moment.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.073
Where's David with the food?

29:31.117 --> 29:31.944
I don't know.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.423
She probably got lost.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.541
What took you so long?

30:04.585 --> 30:05.760
Do you know they have
nine different places

30:05.804 --> 30:06.805
to get food
on this ship?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.415
Yes. I hope you got
something good.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.808
Why are you so grumpy?

30:09.851 --> 30:11.984
You should be happy,
Petty Officer DiNozzo.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.028
[chuckles]

30:13.072 --> 30:14.595
I got it at the
officer's mess.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.988
Of course you did.

30:16.031 --> 30:19.339
Because Burley made you
an officer and me enlisted.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.341
That's why
you're so grumpy.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.169
Now what's
wrong with you?

30:23.212 --> 30:26.302
It's just, my stomach's
been a little queasy.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.477
[gasps]

30:27.521 --> 30:28.217
Seasick?

30:28.261 --> 30:29.479
[chuckles]

30:29.523 --> 30:31.220
