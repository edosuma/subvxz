WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:05.179
[sirens wailing]

00:05.222 --> 00:07.181
Someone was looking
for Navy secrets.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.791
Well, they found them.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.756
The wiring throughout the entire
ship could've flash fire-balled.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.497
Our arsonist knew the
ship's wiring weakness.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.281
[computer beeps]

00:20.324 --> 00:23.110
Meet Bruce Johnson.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.807
GIBBS:
That's the fire department
site inspector.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.287
The guy who hired me
said Plimpton had

00:26.330 --> 00:27.723
information about
some bum wiring.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.811
Who hired you?

00:29.899 --> 00:30.987
ZIVA:
Gibbs, I found this inside.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.554
GIBBS:
Well, that's a list.

00:32.597 --> 00:33.468
Of what?

00:33.511 --> 00:34.773
Every Navy warship that contains

00:34.817 --> 00:35.948
the faulty wiring.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.080
Whoever hired
our arsonist

00:37.124 --> 00:39.039
knows how to attack
U.S. warships.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.041
Blackmail?
Terrorism.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.223
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

01:19.340 --> 01:21.864
â™ª

01:45.757 --> 01:48.108
[fire sizzling]

02:00.990 --> 02:01.904
[grunts]

02:36.721 --> 02:39.594
This is a real threat to our
Naval forces around the world

02:39.637 --> 02:41.639
and requires extreme vigilance.

02:41.683 --> 02:45.165
While NCIS is vigorously
investigating the fires,

02:45.208 --> 02:46.601
we must strengthen,

02:46.644 --> 02:48.951
share our intelligence
collection across the board

02:48.994 --> 02:51.867
to identify the persons,
terrorist group

02:51.910 --> 02:53.477
or nation behind the attacks.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.871
You will be briefed as the
investigation continues.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.612
Thank you.

02:57.655 --> 02:58.917
MAN:
We're clear, sir.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.226
I leave anything out,
Agent Gibbs?

03:03.270 --> 03:04.575
No, I think you covered it, sir.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.142
Thank God the casualties
were at a minimum.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.404
Could've been a lot worse.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.232
I don't think this is
the end of it, sir.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.061
SecNav Jarvis
and I are

03:12.104 --> 03:13.715
meeting with the
National Security Council

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
to brief the President
this afternoon.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.761
They'll have questions.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.502
I hope to have some
answers for you.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.897
When does Director Vance get
back from the NATO conference?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.290
End of the week.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.770
I'm in touch with him
a couple of times a day, sir.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.295
I'm sure he'll be
calling you.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.340
Thank you.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.170
Yeah, I'm leaving now.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.258
Should take me about 15 minutes.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.259
How'd it go, boss?

03:36.303 --> 03:38.043
It goes. You
get your hop?

03:38.087 --> 03:40.437
Yeah. Chopper from Anacostia's
taking me out to the Brewer.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.352
Let me know when you've
secured the crime scene.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.093
You got it.
Also, the ship's turned around

03:44.136 --> 03:45.268
and headed for Norfolk.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.965
When's it arrive?Tomorrow morning.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.793
Bon voyage, McChopper!

03:48.837 --> 03:50.621
What more do we know
about Bruce Johnson?

03:50.665 --> 03:52.536
Not much.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.972
Parole officer
was oblivious.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.278
Johnson never missed
an appointment.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.975
You talk to your friends
at Baltimore P.D.?

03:57.019 --> 03:58.847
Well, yeah. Jason said he hasn't
popped up on the radar.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.196
Wife was not much help.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.285
She knew he was accused
of arson a few years ago,

04:02.329 --> 04:03.895
but had no idea
where he went every day.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.506
Well, how does she think
he supported himself?

04:05.549 --> 04:06.942
For the last year, unemployment.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.422
TONY: Went through his
cell phone records and e-mails.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.380
Johnson hardly used them.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.773
Only a few phone calls,

04:11.816 --> 04:13.383
no e-mails in
the last couple months.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.385
Guess the guy doesn't like to
communicate electronically.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.169
Or he didn't want
to be traced.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.867
Anything on his computer?Nothing of interest.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.260
Abby went through it.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.740
Johnson apparently liked
to play online video games.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.308
So we have no leads on
who might have hired him?

04:25.352 --> 04:28.224
Maybe Johnson isn't connected
to the attack on the Brewer.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.660
Not buying it.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.880
Ship was on the targeted list
found at his house.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.408
Hey, Duck.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.326
Want me to come back later?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.675
No. Sorry.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.155
Uh...Everything okay?

04:46.198 --> 04:47.330
There is something personal

04:47.374 --> 04:48.723
I'd like to talk to you about.

04:48.766 --> 04:49.854
But it can wait.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.814
I wish I could provide
you with a lead,

04:52.857 --> 04:56.557
but poor Mr. Johnson's body here
was so ravaged by fire

04:56.600 --> 04:58.385
that he just isn't
talking to me.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.300
Duck, I know the circumstances,
I know time of death.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.780
I was there, I witnessed it.Twice in one week,

05:02.824 --> 05:07.263
fires so intense they cremated
bone and incinerated flesh.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.352
Well, yeah. That's thermite.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.442
I understand I have two more
bodies from the U.S.S. Brewer?

05:12.486 --> 05:14.096
[cell phone ringing]Yeah. You need to be in Norfolk

05:14.139 --> 05:16.011
tomorrow morning to
pick up the remains.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.317
All right.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.623
Abbs, I'm on
my way up.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.669
Another fire.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.453
Hey, Gibbs.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.368
Abbs, you find something
in Johnson's car?

05:25.412 --> 05:26.848
Um, no. It is toast.

05:26.891 --> 05:27.892
But come here.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.330
What am I looking at?

05:30.373 --> 05:33.115
Confetti!

05:33.158 --> 05:34.682
Just kidding.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.684
Um, so this
cross-cut shredder

05:36.727 --> 05:38.425
was found in
Bruce Johnson's garage.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.515
It slices documents,
horizontally and vertically,

05:41.558 --> 05:44.605
into itsy-bitsy,
teeny-tiny little pieces.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.433
I've identified at least four
documents and separated them.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.304
How'd you do that?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.654
By the color and the texture
of the paper.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.396
Like, this one's glossy,
that's high-end bond,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.310
this is recycled.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.747
But come check this one out.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.144
What do you see?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.542
Looks like Chinese characters.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.544
Close-- it's Korean.

06:10.587 --> 06:13.938
Those symbols are from the
Korean Hangul alphabet.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.549
It's a true alphabet

06:15.592 --> 06:18.334
with 24 consonant
and vowel letters.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.858
But instead of being
written sequentially,

06:20.902 --> 06:23.948
the letters are grouped
into blocks of two to five...

06:23.992 --> 06:26.473
Abbs, can you
reconstruct the document?

06:26.516 --> 06:29.432
Oh. I'm good, Gibbs,
but I'm not that good.

06:29.476 --> 06:33.001
But this document was printed
on laser paper from a computer.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.959
So Bruce Johnson
was communicating

06:35.003 --> 06:36.831
with someone in Korean.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.573
I mean, do you think
North Korea

06:39.616 --> 06:41.618
could be behind
the terrorist attacks?

06:49.452 --> 06:50.453
You are bummed?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.498
I am bummed.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.369
I was really looking
forward to it.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.067
But I am sure we're going
to be on alert all weekend.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.287
Can you, uh, get
the deposit back?

06:58.330 --> 06:59.897
Great.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.812
Okay, I promise,
we will reschedule.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.032
[laughs]:
Okay, talk to
you soon. Bye.

07:04.075 --> 07:07.122
Cancelling weekend plans, huh?

07:07.165 --> 07:08.297
Yes.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.907
Yeah. Who were you talking to?

07:09.951 --> 07:12.475
None of your business.Where were you gonna go?

07:12.519 --> 07:15.260
You don't have the need
to know, Agent Di-Nosy.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.698
Hi, Emma.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.003
Hey.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.614
Well, how is everybody's
favorite analyst?

07:20.657 --> 07:22.398
Busy. Things are hopping
on the Far East desk.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.312
Whew, I can imagine.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.313
[phone ringing]

07:24.356 --> 07:25.619
Special Agent DiNozzo.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.316
Nothing I can find indicates

07:27.359 --> 07:29.274
North Korean involvement in the
attacks, Special Agent Gibbs.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.407
I spoke to analysts at
other agencies-- zilch.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.627
No chatter?Things are quiet in
Pyongyang, for the moment.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.498
Echelon?Hasn't picked up
anything, either.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.499
Right.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.587
McGee's coming online,

07:37.631 --> 07:38.501
MTAC, two minutes.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.850
Keep me posted, Park.

07:39.894 --> 07:40.938
Yes, sir.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.244
DiNozzo, come on.
You're with me.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.553
I am so envious
about your weekend.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.381
I had to cancel.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.861
So...

07:50.905 --> 07:51.906
[chuckles]

07:51.949 --> 07:53.298
Am I the only one
in the dark...

07:53.342 --> 07:54.386
GIBBS:
DiNozzo!

07:54.430 --> 07:56.432
[laughs]

08:04.266 --> 08:06.094
Hey, boss. Tony.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.399
What do we got?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.227
Identities of the two
killed in the fire.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.579
Marine First Lieutenant Eric
Ramsey, a combat cargo officer.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.495
And a civilian, Tobey Abbott,

08:15.538 --> 08:18.367
he's a tech rep for a company
with Navy contracts.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.848
Also a fireman apprentice
received minor burns

08:20.891 --> 08:22.240
while putting out the blaze.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.460
What was the civilian
doing on the ship?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.244
Works for Norton Turbine.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.377
He was, uh, following up
on some repairs

08:28.420 --> 08:30.161
to the ship's power plant.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.294
You okay, McGee?

08:32.337 --> 08:34.557
[sighs, clears throat]

08:34.601 --> 08:36.777
We have to consider
Mr. Abbott a suspect.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.343
He was killed
in the machine room,

08:38.387 --> 08:39.736
which is the point of ignition.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.825
It's his company's equipment
in the machine room?

08:41.869 --> 08:43.000
No. Nowhere near it.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.524
But I've secured
Abbott's quarters;

08:44.567 --> 08:47.570
I just haven't had time
to go through it yet.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.093
[retching]

08:49.137 --> 08:50.573
There she blows.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.619
[sighs]

08:54.751 --> 08:56.274
Oh, McGee.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.276
Seriously?
You're a Navy

08:58.320 --> 08:59.147
criminal
investigator.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.149
Give me a break, Tony, okay?

09:01.192 --> 09:03.325
Three hours ago,
I was sitting at my desk,

09:03.368 --> 09:05.283
then I was choppered out
into the middle of the Atlantic

09:05.327 --> 09:06.546
in a raging storm,

09:06.589 --> 09:07.721
landed on the pitching deck

09:07.764 --> 09:09.592
of an LPD amid 20-foot seas,

09:09.636 --> 09:12.290
and have spent the last hour
in a burnt-out machine room

09:12.334 --> 09:15.555
with acrid smoke
and diesel fuel.

09:15.598 --> 09:16.556
[retching]

09:18.645 --> 09:20.168
Poor guy.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.343
McGee,

09:21.386 --> 09:22.474
we'll be pier-side
when the ship

09:22.518 --> 09:24.564
arrives in Norfolk
tomorrow morning.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.000
Get back to
Bruce Johnson's house,

09:26.043 --> 09:27.610
talk to his wife again,
and see if you can't establish

09:27.654 --> 09:28.611
a North Korean connection.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.612
Right.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.482
Feel better, McGee.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.445
Hey, McGee, apples and crackers.

09:38.839 --> 09:39.970
[retching]

09:45.236 --> 09:48.152
Mrs. Johnson.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.719
NCIS.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.591
I thought you got
everything you needed.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.462
You all but tore
the house apart.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.769
Have another warrant?

09:55.812 --> 09:57.161
Uh, no, Mrs. Johnson.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.641
We just need to ask you
a couple of more questions.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.121
TONY:
Did your husband read

10:00.164 --> 10:01.122
or speak Korean?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.254
Korean?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.387
You're not serious.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.649
He could barely

10:06.693 --> 10:09.173
express himself in English.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.698
Did he have a Korean friend,
a business connection, neighbor?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.047
You're just not
getting it.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.353
God, either of you
ever been divorced?Nah.

10:15.397 --> 10:16.659
Well, we were in the middle
of an ugly one.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.182
We know this is
a very difficult time...

10:18.226 --> 10:19.488
"Difficult"?
[chuckles]

10:19.531 --> 10:21.577
All he left me were
a bunch of bills

10:21.621 --> 10:23.057
and a mortgaged house
we can't sell.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.668
Then the deadbeat blows
himself up in the driveway;

10:25.712 --> 10:27.191
now I'll never
unload it.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.759
I'm sorry to hear about
your husband, Mrs. Johnson.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.718
Yeah, thanks.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.636
Great, more bills.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.637
We done?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.465
I guess so, yeah.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.511
Thanks.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.603
She is one
angry screw.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.518
Huh?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.434
You know, a woman
with a bad temper.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
Shrew, Ziva.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.132
Oh.
[chuckles]

10:55.176 --> 10:56.656
Hold on a
second.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.092
Hey! Excuse me.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.790
Special Agent DiNozzo,
David, NCIS.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.226
Can I ask you a question?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.445
Sure.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.012
Have you ever delivered
any mail

11:05.055 --> 11:06.927
to the Johnson house
from Korea?

11:06.970 --> 11:08.711
No. I'd remember that.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.626
You sure?
Yeah.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.497
Well, they have been
receiving letters

11:12.541 --> 11:13.716
from Switzerland lately.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.676
Good-looking stamps.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.765
Thank you.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.030
Switzerland.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.865
[car door opens and closes]

11:31.908 --> 11:33.910
[distant dog barking]

11:36.173 --> 11:38.219
[knock at door]

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
It's open, Duck.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.700
[door creaks open]

11:41.744 --> 11:44.747
Thanks for letting me drop by.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.271
Yeah, you sounded
troubled on the phone.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.925
[chuckling]:
Oh, really?

11:48.969 --> 11:51.362
No, nothing serious.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.147
Bringing work home?

11:53.190 --> 11:56.498
Yeah, hard copy
of Lieutenant Ramsey's OQR.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.153
Survived two tours in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.419
He has a Purple Heart,
has a Bronze Star.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.424
Gets killed by an American
terrorist on a U.S. ship.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.295
It's tragic.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.949
And senseless.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.866
Yeah.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.825
Want a cup of tea?

12:18.868 --> 12:23.220
Jethro, this is tea dust.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.483
I prefer tea leaves,
steeped in boiling water

12:25.527 --> 12:27.224
in a proper pot.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.661
[chuckles]
But thank you all the same.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.490
What's on your mind?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.883
Well, there
have been

12:33.927 --> 12:37.582
a number of changes in my
life the last few years,

12:37.626 --> 12:40.803
not the least of which
was Mother's passing.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.633
Then selling her house,
moving into town.

12:44.676 --> 12:49.812
I chose not to tell
anyone this, but...

12:49.856 --> 12:52.467
I've come into rather
a lot of money.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.599
Far more than I
will ever need.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.950
I-I didn't say
anything to anyone

12:56.993 --> 13:00.344
because I find that people
tend to treat you differently

13:00.388 --> 13:01.998
if they think you're rich.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.566
Why are you telling me now?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.787
Because I trust you,

13:07.830 --> 13:10.659
and I'd like to ask a favor.

13:10.702 --> 13:14.184
I'm redoing my will.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.796
It-it's still being drafted,

13:16.839 --> 13:20.974
and I have some decisions
to make, but...

13:21.017 --> 13:25.630
well, I'd like you to be
the executor of my estate.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.763
Me, Ducky?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.069
Mm-hmm.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.940
Are you sure about that?
Don't you want a lawyer?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.637
No, I'd rather have a friend

13:32.681 --> 13:35.205
that I can trust
rather than someone

13:35.249 --> 13:37.991
who hardly knows me.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.867
Yeah, I'd be honored.

13:58.707 --> 13:59.664
McGee.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.665
Hey, boss.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.710
Dr. Mallard.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.059
You feeling
any better?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.234
Oh, much better.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.235
The ship's
stopped rocking.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.497
Where are my bodies?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.195
Haven't moved them.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.631
This is
Lieutenant Ramsey.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.893
The civilian's remains

14:10.937 --> 14:13.156
are in the machine
room, just aft.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.680
You find anything
in the civilian's quarters?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.291
I haven't gotten to it yet.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.640
Spent the night in sick bay.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.685
Didn't want
to contaminate the scene.Okay.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.513
Take, uh, Tony and Ziva
with you, will you?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.732
Where are they?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.125
TONY:
That's the whole thing--

14:25.168 --> 14:26.343
James Bond is fantasy.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.302
I'll be with Ducky
and the arson specialists.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.260
[Tony whistling jaunty melody]

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
[grunts] McGee.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.089
Got a little present for you.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.961
What?
Barf bags.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
[sighs]

14:41.097 --> 14:43.186
Wow.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.928
Has Abby finalized plans for
Palmer's bachelor party?

14:45.972 --> 14:47.060
Uh, don't know.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.278
She hasn't talked.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.758
She's keeping
everything under wraps.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.325
I wouldn't
worry, though.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.066
Abby would not
disappoint us.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.197
What is this
American thing--

14:54.241 --> 14:56.156
grown men acting
like fraternity boys?

14:56.199 --> 14:58.158
I do not understand.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.289
What's not to
understand?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.464
You got your booze,
your strippers.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.726
Total debauchery.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.511
Abby would never plan
something like that.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.340
[chuckles softly]

15:06.383 --> 15:07.994
Clotrimazole.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.691
Poor Abbott has jock itch.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.345
Not anymore.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.869
McGEE: Hey, Ziva, the weekend's
coming up, and we're on alert.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
Doesn't that blow
your plans for...

15:17.090 --> 15:19.005
Seriously?

15:19.048 --> 15:21.181
I mean, does
everybody but me

15:21.224 --> 15:23.052
know your plans
for this weekend?

15:23.096 --> 15:24.532
Oh, look at this.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.055
It's got a Swiss stamp.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.317
What does that mean?

15:31.582 --> 15:32.975
Korean.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.368
Korean?

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
This connects the attacks.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.112
PARK:
It's gibberish.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.157
What do you mean?

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
It's a meaningless
collection of Korean script.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.291
These are all symbols

15:44.334 --> 15:45.770
from the Hangul
alphabet.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.556
However, their arrangement
forms no words or sentences.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.428
Could it be a dialect
or regional language?

15:51.472 --> 15:52.777
I showed it to a professor

15:52.821 --> 15:54.214
of Korean language and culture
at Georgetown.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.303
He assured me
it made absolutely no sense.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.609
It's a code.I thought the same thing.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.872
I sent a copy
to our cryptographers.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.396
Haven't heard anything.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.572
I'll contact them
as soon as we finish here.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.269
I've talked to State
and the CIA.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.923
Their North Korean experts
gave no indication

16:07.967 --> 16:10.186
of that country's involvement
in the attacks.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.796
Actually,
under their new leadership,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
they've been playing nice.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.713
For the moment.

16:15.757 --> 16:19.500
So, if it's not North Korea,
who are we dealing with?

16:27.508 --> 16:29.379
GIBBS: What do we
know about Abbott?

16:29.423 --> 16:31.729
Tobey "No Middle Name"
Abbott, 29.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.949
Single, born
in Norwalk, Connecticut.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.298
No police or
military record.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
Attended Rensselaer
Polytechnical Institute

16:37.300 --> 16:38.736
in Troy, New York.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.434
Nothing distinguishing.
Had three jobs

16:40.477 --> 16:43.089
before joining Norton Turbine
as a mechanic a year ago.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
That's it?That's it.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.309
I'll let you know. Thanks.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.746
Not so fast, Ms. David.
I just got off

16:48.790 --> 16:50.966
the phone with Abbott's
high school advisor.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.228
Had his heart
set on going

16:52.272 --> 16:53.795
to the Naval Academy,
but got rejected.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.057
Abbott wanted it so bad,

16:55.101 --> 16:56.537
he spent the year
after high school

16:56.580 --> 16:58.191
attending a service academy
prep school.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.366
And he got rejected again.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.281
You got it.Think he holds a grudge?

17:01.324 --> 17:04.414
Talk to Abbott's supervisor
at Norton Turbine.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.463
TONY:
Oh, yeah.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.291
Ducky dropped that off
a little while ago.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.471
Why would he
give you tea leaves?

17:21.257 --> 17:23.303
Tony can be
so transparent.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.695
You think?

17:24.739 --> 17:27.394
Yeah. He came down here
asking me about thermite,

17:27.437 --> 17:29.439
but, really, he was fishing.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.701
He was trying to find out

17:30.745 --> 17:32.268
what Ziva had planned
for the weekend.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.443
You didn't tell him, did you?

17:33.487 --> 17:35.358
Of course not.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.230
It's driving him crazy.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.797
Yeah, but it's just
Pilates weekend

17:39.841 --> 17:41.495
with her landlady.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.192
Yeah, but that's
not what Tony's

17:43.236 --> 17:44.454
dirty little mind
is thinking.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.500
Hey. We getting anywhere?

17:46.543 --> 17:47.588
Um...

17:47.631 --> 17:49.851
the arson inspectors
sent me residue

17:49.894 --> 17:52.245
of the accelerant used
on the fire aboard the Brewer.

17:52.288 --> 17:55.161
Major Mass Spec is
back on his game.

17:55.204 --> 17:58.338
He just I.D.'d the residue
as the exact same mixture

17:58.381 --> 18:00.514
of thermite and fire retardant

18:00.557 --> 18:02.298
that Detective King
and I identified

18:02.342 --> 18:03.560
in the other fires.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.649
Same signature;
it's a different arsonist.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.869
Why did it do
more damage to the ship?

18:07.912 --> 18:09.262
Have a theory, boss.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.480
Let me show you.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.092
On the deck directly below
the machine room

18:13.135 --> 18:14.963
is the magazine locker,
and it contains

18:15.006 --> 18:17.183
thousands of pounds
worth of explosives.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.532
Now, there's no way that Abbott

18:18.575 --> 18:20.403
could have gained access
to that area.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.013
His plan was to ignite
the slow-burning,

18:22.057 --> 18:23.145
intensely hot
thermite fire

18:23.189 --> 18:24.668
in the area just above.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.105
McGEE:
And when it burned

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
through the deck
and hit the magazine below,

18:28.150 --> 18:29.760
the ship would have been
severely damaged,

18:29.804 --> 18:30.805
maybe even sunk.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.198
Why didn't that happen?

18:32.241 --> 18:34.330
This is a file photo
of the machine room.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.550
And here is the
point of ignition.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.291
Now, what Abbott
didn't realize was

18:38.334 --> 18:41.381
these three tanks contained
highly flammable material.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.166
Before the fire could
burn below as intended,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.168
the tanks ignited and
caused the explosion

18:46.212 --> 18:47.822
that killed him and
Lieutenant Ramsey.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.302
Gibbs, did you see

18:49.345 --> 18:51.304
the John Wayne movie,
Hellfighters?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.349
Yeah.
The Duke played Red Adair,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.177
the oil well firefighter.Okay.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.613
What happened on the ship

18:56.657 --> 18:58.746
is exactly what happened
when Red used the dynamite.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.443
The explosion
created a vacuum,

19:00.487 --> 19:02.184
and it sucked out
all the oxygen

19:02.228 --> 19:03.359
and extinguished
the fire.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.839
Lucky.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
We getting anywhere
decoding the Korean document?

19:07.233 --> 19:10.410
Um, no, but it did come
from the same printer

19:10.453 --> 19:13.500
and it's the same paper
as the shredded document

19:13.543 --> 19:15.023
that we found
at Bruce Johnson's.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
Dusted it and
the envelope for prints.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.287
Only got Abbott's.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.159
We also found DNA
on the flap

19:20.202 --> 19:21.377
of the envelope
where someone licked it.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.118
Who? You got a name?No.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
I ran it through
active military

19:24.859 --> 19:26.513
and known felons
and Interpol.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.297
Nothing yet,
but I'll keep trying.

19:31.779 --> 19:34.085
You're welcome.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.916
MAN:
I was the one who interviewed

19:38.960 --> 19:41.005
and hired Tobey Abbott
little over a year ago.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.529
ZIVA: What exactly
was he doing

19:42.572 --> 19:44.357
for your company
aboard the USS Brewer?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.663
We did some repairs
to the ship's power plant.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.883
It's customary to
send a mechanic

19:48.926 --> 19:50.885
to make sure everything's
working properly

19:50.928 --> 19:52.887
under operating
conditions.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.106
Do you know what
caused the explosion?

19:55.150 --> 19:56.978
Still under investigation.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.415
Why did you select Abbott to go?

19:59.459 --> 20:00.547
He was a good
mechanic.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.723
Not our best;
more than adequate.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.508
To be honest, he lobbied
for the assignment.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.206
Really?
Careful.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.381
[horn honking]

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
I usually have
to beg my guys

20:10.426 --> 20:12.341
to go out to sea
on Navy contracts.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.603
They're not
pleasure cruises.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.084
You can be stuck
on the ship for weeks

20:16.127 --> 20:17.520
waiting until it
reaches a port.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.957
Did Abbott say
why he wanted to go?
No.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.568
My guess--

20:21.611 --> 20:23.961
unlike most of the
others, he was single.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.441
Wasn't leaving
a family.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.617
Plus there's a small
pay incentive.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.489
You know who he hung with?
Anyone at work?

20:29.532 --> 20:30.751
Tobey could
be moody.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.143
Pretty much kept to himself.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.536
Well, if you think
of anything else,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.538
would you give me call?Sure.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.717
Did Tobey Abbott
speak Korean?

20:41.675 --> 20:44.808
Uh, don't know,
but I seriously doubt it.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.376
Thanks.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.988
DUCKY:
I found traces

20:51.032 --> 20:53.295
of a substance
under Mr. Abbott's fingernails

20:53.339 --> 20:55.906
that Abby identifies
as the same combination

20:55.950 --> 20:58.082
of thermite and fire retardant

20:58.126 --> 21:00.520
that's coated
Bruce Johnson's body.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.304
One more thing
connecting the fires.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.566
Yeah.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.742
The cause of Lieutenant
Ramsey's death

21:05.786 --> 21:07.483
was blunt force trauma.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.051
He would have
survived his burns,

21:10.094 --> 21:12.183
but with the force
of the explosion,

21:12.227 --> 21:14.708
he fractured his skull
on a bulkhead.

21:14.751 --> 21:18.364
Oh, I found this

21:18.407 --> 21:20.714
in one of his pockets.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.894
Wife's a kid herself, Duck.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.722
[cell phone buzzing]

21:32.682 --> 21:35.294
I got to go.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.779
You have beautiful children.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.830
I can't believe
you're still with Gibbs.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.049
Has he, has he
mellowed with age?

21:52.093 --> 21:54.748
What do you think?

21:54.791 --> 21:57.533
Last time I spoke with him was
right after Mike Franks died.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.057
He didn't want to talk about it.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.363
He keeps a lot inside.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.582
Yeah.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.584
What's he building
in his basement now?

22:04.627 --> 22:05.672
I don't know.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.195
Haven't been down there
in a while.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.457
Down where, DiNozzo?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.677
Hi-ya, boss.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.591
Special Agent Burley.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.027
You got something for us?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.071
Oh, yeah.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.377
Where are you?

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
Naples, Italy.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.859
I came here to perform
a port-threat assessment

22:18.902 --> 22:20.600
prior to the arrival
of the aircraft carrier,

22:20.643 --> 22:21.601
the Benjamin Franklin.

22:21.644 --> 22:22.863
It's due in tomorrow.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.647
And then I got the alert.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.562
The Benjamin Franklin'son
the list of marked vessels.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.781
You find something?

22:27.824 --> 22:29.217
I was conducting a search

22:29.260 --> 22:30.827
of the warehouse that serves
as a collection point

22:30.871 --> 22:33.352
for goods and equipment that are
going to resupply the ship.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.702
Found an explosive device
hidden on a palette.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.746
What kind of device?

22:36.790 --> 22:38.966
Thermite,
with a magnesium fuse.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.185
Just like described
in the alert.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.710
A nuclear aircraft carrier.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.757
They're upping the stakes.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.288
[whistling]

22:57.332 --> 22:59.116
Andiamo, bambina!

22:59.160 --> 23:00.727
Dove? Gear up.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.859
We're leaving for Naples.

23:02.903 --> 23:03.860
[laughs]

23:03.904 --> 23:05.079
Naples, Italy?

23:05.122 --> 23:06.385
Si.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.690
I'm going home
to grab some clothes.

23:07.734 --> 23:08.909
You should do the same.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.650
We're hopping
a military flight

23:10.693 --> 23:11.912
from Andrews Air Force Base.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.653
This one of
your practical jokes?

23:13.696 --> 23:15.350
Nope. Gibbs' orders.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.525
[elevator bell dings]

23:20.616 --> 23:22.575
It's a good thing you canceled
your Pilates weekend.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.793
Who told you?

23:23.837 --> 23:25.055
I'm a very
special agent.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.623
I have my ways.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.066
[elevator bell dings]

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
Hey!

23:42.508 --> 23:44.205
Come on.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.293
Wake up.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.600
Get up.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.731
[grunts]

23:48.775 --> 23:50.820
I've got coffee.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.605
I've got Danish.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.563
What do you got?

23:54.607 --> 23:55.782
Gibbs.

23:55.825 --> 23:58.088
You're not mad at us
for waking you up?

23:58.132 --> 23:59.481
Depends what
you found.

23:59.525 --> 24:03.485
Boss, we broke the code
on the Korean message.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.357
It took us a long time because
we and the cryptologists

24:06.401 --> 24:08.359
thought that it was gonna be
really complicated,

24:08.403 --> 24:09.665
but it wasn't.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.188
It was actually easy.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.670
Using a Korean-Hangul
word processing program,

24:14.714 --> 24:16.803
the person who
sent the message

24:16.846 --> 24:19.849
typed the words into
an English-alphabet keyboard.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.982
But it was printed out

24:22.025 --> 24:23.505
in Hangul script.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.725
I'll show you the first line
of the document.

24:25.768 --> 24:32.471
"Place the thermite device
on the 0-3 deck."

24:32.514 --> 24:36.475
Those characters don't form
Korean words, Gibbs.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.782
So it would be meaningless to
anyone that was reading Korean.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.219
Reversing the process,
decodes the message.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.831
Uncoded, the rest of it
instructed Abbott

24:44.874 --> 24:47.616
when, where and how to attack
the U.S.S. Brewer.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.010
Don't suppose he was
dumb enough to sign it?

24:53.056 --> 24:55.668
Any luck with the DNA
on the envelope?

24:55.711 --> 24:58.409
Unfortunately, no.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.419
Ooh.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.953
[tires screech, horn honks]

25:32.443 --> 25:33.836
BURLEY:
Hey, guys.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.969
Good to see you again, DiNozzo.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.187
Hey, man,
how are you?

25:37.231 --> 25:39.015
Hi. Special Agent
Ziva David.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.190
Agent Burley.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.191
It's a pleasure.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.453
Stan, please.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.673
Welcome to Napoli,
the home of Mount Vesuvius,

25:44.717 --> 25:46.849
pizza and romance.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.242
[chuckles]I got it, Tony.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.026
Heard a lot about you, Stan.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.027
Uh-oh. From who?

25:51.071 --> 25:52.594
Abby. All good.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
Ah, she never says
anything bad about anyone.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.858
I love that woman.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.207
When'd you get here?

25:57.251 --> 25:59.166
Last week. I was enjoying
the weather and cuisine

25:59.209 --> 26:00.559
until we were put on alert.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.212
I see the Benjamin Franklin
has arrived.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.258
Yeah, it dropped anchor
about an hour ago.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.870
So, you're the senior
field agent in charge.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.090
What's the game plan, Stan?

26:10.133 --> 26:11.918
The palette's still
in the warehouse.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.094
Thermite's been replaced with
an inert, look-alike substance.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.139
It'll be barged out to the ship
in a couple hours

26:16.183 --> 26:17.445
and put in the cargo bay.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.882
The three of us will
board the ship, undercover,

26:19.926 --> 26:21.884
as Navy personnel
joining the deployment.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.583
Let me help you with that, Ziva.

26:24.626 --> 26:28.543
We've got a water taxi, it's
gonna take us out to the ship.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.892
We're going to stake out
the cargo bay

26:29.936 --> 26:31.241
and wait to see
who comes for the thermite.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.765
Yeah, and there's over
5,000 onboard,

26:32.808 --> 26:34.593
so we're looking for
a needle in a haystack.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.638
Fire on the Brewerwas
started by a civilian.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.726
A tech rep, I know.

26:37.770 --> 26:38.988
I read the bulletin
from headquarters.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.164
I checked,
there are 32 civilians

26:41.208 --> 26:42.862
on the Benjamin Franklin
right now.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.515
The problem is,
if we question them,

26:44.559 --> 26:46.909
we'll spook whoever it is
before they go for the bait.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.956
After you, Ziva.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.397
Stay classy, Stan.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.572
[laughs]

26:57.616 --> 26:59.095
Andiamo.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.141
[boat engine revving]

27:14.328 --> 27:15.285
Pardon me, sir.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.330
Morning, Jethro.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.200
Hey, morning, Duck.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.680
Something happen?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.116
No, false alarm.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.553
Aboard a missile frigate off
the coast of Diego Garcia.

27:22.597 --> 27:26.296
Ah. I just released Ramsey's
body for burial at Arlington.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.256
A fully executed
copy of my will.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.867
Besides a couple of
bequeaths to a nephew

27:31.911 --> 27:35.001
in Scotland and my
good friends at NCIS,

27:35.044 --> 27:37.003
I'm leaving the bulk of
my estate to charity.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.308
That's nice.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.484
I was really struck
by that photograph of

27:40.528 --> 27:43.836
the young lieutenant with
his wife and children.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.012
Yeah, I was, too.
I sent her a note last night.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.710
I was struggling with the
decision as to where the money

27:48.754 --> 27:49.885
would do the
most good--

27:49.929 --> 27:51.974
there are so many
worthy charities.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.628
I had been considering

27:53.672 --> 27:55.804
the Marine Corps
Scholarship Foundation.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.111
They do so much good for
Marine Corps families.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.678
They give them
the means

27:59.721 --> 28:01.114
to send their kids to college.

28:01.157 --> 28:04.160
Seeing Lieutenant
Ramsey's young children

28:04.204 --> 28:05.988
just made the decision for me.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.294
Yeah, that's nice.

28:07.337 --> 28:08.774
Real nice, Duck.

28:08.817 --> 28:09.731
Oorah.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.777
Oorah.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.095
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

28:41.328 --> 28:42.938
[quietly]:
Got a bogey.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.463
About time.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.603
Getting warmer.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.390
Standing in front of the hatch.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.358
Hi.

29:11.401 --> 29:12.925
Afraid you weren't
gonna show.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.535
[chuckles]
You kidding?

29:14.578 --> 29:16.711
MAN:
Been thinking
about you all day.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.712
Did you miss me?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.888
Come on, let's go.
[giggles]

29:19.932 --> 29:20.976
Hmm.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.195
False alarm.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.067
Two young seamen
anxious to parallel park.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.416
[chuckles]

29:26.460 --> 29:28.897
Busting them is not
our problem at the moment.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.073
Where's David with the food?

29:31.117 --> 29:31.944
I don't know.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.423
She probably got lost.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.541
What took you so long?

30:04.585 --> 30:05.760
Do you know they have
nine different places

30:05.804 --> 30:06.805
to get food
on this ship?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.415
Yes. I hope you got
something good.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.808
Why are you so grumpy?

30:09.851 --> 30:11.984
You should be happy,
Petty Officer DiNozzo.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.028
[chuckles]

30:13.072 --> 30:14.595
I got it at the
officer's mess.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.988
Of course you did.

30:16.031 --> 30:19.339
Because Burley made you
an officer and me enlisted.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.341
That's why
you're so grumpy.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.169
Now what's
wrong with you?

30:23.212 --> 30:26.302
It's just, my stomach's
been a little queasy.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.477
[gasps]

30:27.521 --> 30:28.217
Seasick?

30:28.261 --> 30:29.479
[chuckles]

30:29.523 --> 30:31.220
We're still
at the harbor.

30:31.264 --> 30:34.093
If you tell McGee, I'm gonna
post those bikini photos

30:34.136 --> 30:36.095
that I have
on the agency Web site.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.836
I told you to
destroy them.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.707
Well, a man's
got to have leverage.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.665
[groans]

30:41.709 --> 30:43.232
I got to hit the head.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.063
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.684
Game's on, Stan.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.869
[lock clicks]

31:41.029 --> 31:43.031
â™ª

31:48.080 --> 31:49.733
BURLEY:
Okay, he's going for the bait.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.708
[Burley grunts, gunshot]

32:07.751 --> 32:08.752
Burley?

32:14.976 --> 32:16.456
NCIS! Stay back!

32:16.499 --> 32:19.111
Okay, this is the
only way in or out.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.677
All the other
hatches are secure.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.993
ZIVA [whispering]:
Tony.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.130
Still breathing.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.219
Weapon's gone.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.612
Corpsman's
on the way.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.251
[clanging and rattling]

33:15.210 --> 33:16.559
[groans weakly]

33:24.741 --> 33:26.482
How's Burley?

33:26.526 --> 33:28.223
See for yourself.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.139
Hey, boss.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.228
Navy docs are great.
I'll be okay.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.056
Well, a couple weeks
R and R will help.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.277
DiNozzo, what's the condition
of the suspect?

33:38.320 --> 33:39.843
His name is AndrÃ© Fullerton.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.323
He's a tech rep,

33:41.367 --> 33:44.457
employed by an avionics
communications firm.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.373
Who put you up to this,
Fullerton?

33:47.416 --> 33:49.070
Put me up to what?

33:49.114 --> 33:51.290
Sabotaging a U.S. Navy ship.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.164
You stabbed a federal agent.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.036
Shouldn't someone
be reading me my rights?

33:58.079 --> 33:59.167
You have no rights.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.517
You're a terrorist
on a U.S. Navy ship.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.954
And we're invoking
the Patriot Act.

34:03.998 --> 34:06.261
In an hour, you're going to be
flown off this ship,

34:06.305 --> 34:08.002
escorted by
Agent David and myself,

34:08.046 --> 34:09.351
to Aviano Air Base,

34:09.395 --> 34:11.745
where you're
going to board a C-37A

34:11.788 --> 34:13.573
and you're
going to be flown

34:13.616 --> 34:15.183
to GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.967
Once there,
you're going to be staying

34:17.011 --> 34:21.407
at a sunny little seaside resort
the locals call Gitmo.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.062
Heard a nasty rumor
about what goes on down there.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.715
You'll never
be heard from again.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.022
Your friends, your family,

34:28.066 --> 34:29.632
they won't know
what happened to you.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.373
So I'm going to ask you again.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.073
Who hired you?

34:35.116 --> 34:36.813
You're bluffing.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.467
Agent Gibbs does not bluff.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.297
Can we make some kind of deal?

34:42.341 --> 34:44.647
You're in no position
to negotiate.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.693
For the last time,

34:46.736 --> 34:49.217
who's behind
the terrorist attacks?

34:55.005 --> 34:59.097
You yank him out of that rack,
and you put him on a plane.

35:00.968 --> 35:01.925
Hold it! Hold it!

35:01.969 --> 35:03.971
I'll tell you.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.931
His name's...

35:07.975 --> 35:09.498
Harper Dearing.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.414
Tell us about him.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.112
I don't know
anything.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.157
Your memory will improve
once you get to Gitmo.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.115
I never saw him.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.942
I spoke to him
on the phone.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.379
He explained,
after that,

35:20.422 --> 35:23.077
he'd only communicate
in Korean code.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.384
That's it?

35:25.427 --> 35:26.472
Not good enough.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.603
Enjoy Cuba.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.779
No...!

35:29.823 --> 35:32.956
He had what
Northerners would call

35:33.000 --> 35:35.220
a slight Southern drawl.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.267
I know.
I'm from Mississippi.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.269
That's all I know.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.447
Why did you do it?

35:47.884 --> 35:49.234
Money.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.236
Lots of money.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.107
DiNozzo.

35:58.286 --> 35:59.548
Yeah, boss.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.202
Put him on suicide watch.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.596
I want to make sure
he gets back here for trial.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.598
You got it.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.687
Boss, I've found
seven Harper Dearings

36:07.730 --> 36:09.123
in the United States.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.298
Four of them either

36:10.342 --> 36:12.431
currently reside
or were born in the South.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.562
Let's hear it.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.608
Harper Dearing,
48-year-old housewife,

36:15.651 --> 36:17.262
Chattanooga,
Tennessee.
No. Next.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.263
Harper Dearing number two.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.699
He's currently 84,

36:19.742 --> 36:22.267
residing in a nursing home
for retired clergy.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.356
Next.
Harper Dearing
number three.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.314
Second grader
in a Little Rock, Arkansas

36:26.358 --> 36:28.273
elementary school.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.014
Yeah.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.234
Harper Dearing number four.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.541
61 years old,
born in Augusta, Georgia.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.195
Currently resides
in Virginia.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.500
Yeah, let me hear it.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.199
He's the CEO
of Dorado Hills Investments,

36:41.242 --> 36:43.113
a multinational
venture capital group

36:43.157 --> 36:45.333
that specializes
in technology companies.

36:45.377 --> 36:46.987
It's headquartered
in Sterling, Virginia.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.293
Criminal or
military record?
Neither.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.387
Why would a corporate executive

36:55.430 --> 36:57.737
be terrorizing
U.S. Navy vessels?

36:57.780 --> 36:58.868
Doesn't make sense.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.522
Get his name down to Abby.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.307
She's got a DNA sample
from the envelope.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.178
See if she can
match it up to him.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.484
And if she can't, maybe he's got

37:05.527 --> 37:07.225
a close relative
whose DNA is on file.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.554
Gibbs?

37:38.125 --> 37:40.170
What are you doing?

37:40.214 --> 37:43.348
Cleaning my weapon
and waiting for you to get in.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.790
How's Burley?
He's fine.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.140
McGee said Dearing had a son
that was in the Navy.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.315
Did you get a DNA match?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.491
I've had people working

37:56.535 --> 37:59.102
in the lab all night.
Let me check my e-mail.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.453
[typing]

38:01.496 --> 38:04.456
I'm having them compare
the DNA from the envelope

38:04.499 --> 38:06.284
that was found
in Abbott's quarters

38:06.327 --> 38:08.634
to the DNA of
Dearing's son, Evan.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.505
Okay, it's here.

38:10.549 --> 38:13.334
They found
a familial match.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.337
There is
99.9% probability

38:16.381 --> 38:19.122
that Harper Dearing
is your guy.

38:39.491 --> 38:40.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

38:41.014 --> 38:43.321
Where's Dearing's office?

38:43.364 --> 38:45.366
Second floor.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.157
NCIS.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.343
MAN: No, no,
I'll call you back.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.345
May I help you?

39:07.388 --> 39:09.390
Who are you?
Vincent Maple.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.870
I'm the president
of this company.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.394
Where is Dearing?I have no idea.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.483
Why are you looking for him?

39:15.527 --> 39:16.963
We have a warrant
for his arrest.

39:18.747 --> 39:21.315
He's wanted for terrorism
and four counts of murder.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.666
Where is he?

39:24.710 --> 39:27.234
I don't know.

39:27.277 --> 39:30.498
Look, I haven't seen or heard
from him in over a year.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.980
Well, how do you get
in touch with him?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.460
I don't.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.167
GIBBS:
Listen up.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.829
For attacks against
the United States Navy.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.223
Harper Dearing.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.574
Let's go.
We got work to do.

CBS
