WEBVTT

00:03.002 --> 00:04.963
- HI, GLAD YOU'RE BACK.
LET ME CATCH YOU UP.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.381
ELKA WON A SPOT ON CITY COUNCIL.

00:06.464 --> 00:09.467
- [laughs] YOU WON!
- I WON!

00:09.551 --> 00:12.053
- VICTORIA SHARED AN
ACADEMY AWARD WITH HELEN MIRREN.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.638
- AND THE OSCAR GOES TO
HELEN MIRREN.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.056
- [bleep]!

00:16.140 --> 00:18.059
- AND VICTORIA CHASE.
- WHAT?

00:18.143 --> 00:20.437
- IT'S A TIE!
both: [scream]

00:20.520 --> 00:22.897
- AND JOY WAS PROPOSED TO BY
THREE GUYS ON THE SAME NIGHT--

00:22.981 --> 00:24.899
SIMON, MITCH, AND BOB.

00:24.983 --> 00:25.900
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER,

00:25.984 --> 00:28.278
SHE WAS KNOCKED OUT BY SIMON,
MITCH, AND BOB.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.614
OH, SHE'S NOT GONNA LIKE
THAT PICTURE.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.531
BETTER START THE SHOW.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.744
- WHICH DO YOU THINK
IS THE BIGGEST NEWS--

00:35.827 --> 00:38.455
WHO JOY HAS CHOSEN TO MARRY

00:38.538 --> 00:42.375
OR THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT
IN MY SUPER-EXCITING CAREER?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.796
- PROBABLY JOY'S THING.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.631
- BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
MY THING YET.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.135
- I HAVEN'T HEARD
JOY'S THING EITHER.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.471
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU ANYWAY.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.140
I AM FLYING TO NEW YORK
THIS AFTERNOON

00:57.223 --> 00:59.768
TO STAR IN A MOVIE
WITH BRAD PITT.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.020
- BRAD PITT!

01:02.103 --> 01:04.563
I MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE
ONE OF YOUR MOVIES.

01:06.065 --> 01:09.319
- I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT
THE LEAD IN AN HBO DRAMA

01:09.402 --> 01:12.489
WHEN MY DARLING CO-OSCAR-WINNING
HELEN MIRREN CALLED.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.283
OH, SHE HAD TO PASS
ON THE BRAD PITT MOVIE,

01:15.366 --> 01:17.452
SO SHE RECOMMENDED ME.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.162
OH.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.582
IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL THE WAY
WE A-LISTERS GIVE FREELY.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.175
- I'M BACK!
OH.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.635
OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE HOME.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.637
- OH, AND IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HOME.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.679
BUT WHERE'S MELANIE?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.014
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DRIVING YOU
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.808
- YES, SHE WAS,

01:39.891 --> 01:41.309
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID I SHOULD
AVOID STRESSFUL SITUATIONS.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.520
- DID SHE SAY WHO SHE WAS
GONNA MARRY YET?!

01:43.603 --> 01:44.938
SIMON, MITCH, OR BOB?
SIMON, MITCH, OR BOB?

01:46.314 --> 01:48.399
- SO I TOOK A CAB.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.862
PLUS, I WANTED TO TELL ALL
OF YOU MY DECISION TOGETHER.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.031
- SO WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

01:55.114 --> 01:57.826
- WELL, I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
PICTURING MYSELF

01:57.909 --> 02:00.203
MARRIED TO EACH ONE OF THEM,
AND ONLY ONE OF THEM FELT RIGHT.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.371
- MITCH?
- NO.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.497
- BOB?
- NO.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.874
- SIMON!
I KNEW IT!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.710
- YES, IT'S SIMON.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SIMON.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.003
HE WAS MY FIRST LOVE, AND WHEN
HE CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE,

02:10.088 --> 02:11.548
IT JUST FELT LIKE DESTINY.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.049
- OH, THAT IS WONDERFUL,
SWEETIE.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.133
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM YET?

02:14.217 --> 02:17.554
- NO, I HAVE TO BREAK THE NEWS
TO BOB AND MITCH FIRST.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.430
I OWE THEM THAT.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA TELL MITCH?

02:19.514 --> 02:21.474
- OH, I HAVE IT
ALL PLANNED OUT

02:21.558 --> 02:23.351
SO WE PART AS FRIENDS.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.728
I GO OVER IN MY BLACK DRESS
THAT MAKES ME LOOK SORRY

02:25.812 --> 02:28.273
BUT IN A HOT WAY.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.400
I REFERENCE
HIS BEST QUALITIES:

02:30.483 --> 02:33.194
HE'S HANDSOME, KIND,

02:33.278 --> 02:35.697
HANDSOME.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.534
WE KISS FAREWELL AND HE ASKS--
NO, INSISTS

02:39.617 --> 02:41.077
THAT WE REMAIN GOOD FRIENDS.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.746
[cell phone rings]

02:43.830 --> 02:46.749
IT'S MITCH.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.586
HELLO.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.087
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WE'LL NEVER BE FRIENDS?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.298
HOW DID YOU--

02:53.381 --> 02:55.425
HE BUGGED THE LIVING ROOM.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.472
WELL, YOU'RE A DETECTIVE,
I SUPPOSE THAT'S NORMAL.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.767
[mouthing]

03:04.851 --> 03:06.519
- CAMERAS, TOO?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.404

{\an8}- HMM, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.085
{\an8}I HAD NO IDEA
THOSE CAMERAS WERE THERE,

03:31.169 --> 03:33.504
{\an8}BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE,
I KIND OF MISS THEM.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.636

03:41.763 --> 03:44.307
{\an8}- THE HEAT'S ON.
I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF TOWN.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.477

AT THE COUNCIL MEETING,

03:47.560 --> 03:48.937
{\an8}ELKA ANNOUNCED
THAT SHE HAS A PLAN

03:49.020 --> 03:51.022
{\an8}TO BRING A THOUSAND JOBS
TO CLEVELAND.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.025
{\an8}SHE HAS NO PLAN.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:54.108 --> 03:56.110
{\an8}- THE MAYOR WAS BEING
ALL BRAGGY.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.697
{\an8}YOU KNOW HOW I GET.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.201
{\an8}- FINE. FINE, BUT I AM NOT
INTRODUCING YOU TO BRAD PITT.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.578
{\an8}- WE'LL SEE.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.833
{\an8}- OH, HEY.
DID YOU BREAK THE NEWS TO BOB?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.335
{\an8}- NOT YET.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.295
{\an8}I TRIED TO CALL, BUT I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO REACH HIM.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.005
{\an8}I HATE TO LET HIM DOWN.
HE'S SO SWEET.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.673
{\an8}- HE REALLY IS,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.509
{\an8}BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU AND SIMON
SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.010

{\an8}- WELL, LET ME TELL HIM.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.847
{\an8}WE'RE FRIENDS.
I WILL LET HIM DOWN GENTLY.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.474
{\an8}- REALLY?
- YES.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.018
{\an8}SO GO AND PLAN YOUR PERFECT
SCOTTISH WEDDING.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.395
{\an8}- OH, MELANIE, THANK YOU.

04:30.478 --> 04:34.023
{\an8}- GO,
BE WITH THE MAN YOU LOVE.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.526
{\an8}- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.569
{\an8}OH, I CAN PICTURE IT NOW:

04:38.653 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}A SCOTTISH CASTLE,
THE GROOMSMEN IN KILTS,

04:42.073 --> 04:43.866
{\an8}AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.619
{\an8}MY DARLING SIMON HEROICALLY
PUMPING THE BAGPIPES.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.250
- DON'T CALL YOURSELF NAMES,
JOY.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.050
- I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,
BOB.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.552
I'M SO SORRY.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.222
- WELL, I KNEW PROPOSING
WAS A LONG SHOT.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.223
I MEAN, I TALK A GOOD GAME,

05:07.306 --> 05:09.767
BUT I KNOW
JOY'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.562
I JUST THOUGHT THIS TIME
I'D FOUND THE ONE.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.856
- OH.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.941
I-I'VE GOTTEN CLOSE
A FEW TIMES.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.570
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,
AND IT--IT HURTS.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.614
BUT YOU ARE A SMART, FUNNY,
WONDERFUL MAN.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.450
- [sighs]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.617
I AM HANDSOME.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.453
- YES.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.746
AND HANDSOME.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.081
AND THERE ARE
SO MANY WOMEN OUT THERE

05:32.165 --> 05:35.043
WHO COULD EASILY
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.053
OH, GOD.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.680
I HOPE THERE ARE NO MORE
HIDDEN CAMERAS IN THIS HOUSE.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.985
- JOY.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.404
HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.490
- YES, SIMON.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.116
I WILL MARRY YOU.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.911
- JOY, MM,
YOU'VE MADE ME SO HAPPY.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.122
- HELLO.
- OH!

06:15.083 --> 06:16.918
WHO'S SHE?
- OH, HER.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.461
UM, THIS IS--

06:18.544 --> 06:20.713
UH,
[laughs]

06:20.797 --> 06:23.299
WE ARE SO GONNA LAUGH ABOUT THIS
AT OUR 50th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.010
THIS IS MY WIFE.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.019
- YOUR WIFE?
- THIS IS YESENIA.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.771
- HELLO.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.981
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.483
HOW COULD YOU PROPOSE TO ME

06:40.566 --> 06:42.485
AND NOT TELL ME
YOU WERE ALREADY MARRIED?

06:42.568 --> 06:43.277
- WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD SAY NO.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.154
- I WOULD HAVE SAID NO.
- EXACTLY.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.698
YESENIA AND I ARE ONLY MARRIED
IN THE LEGAL SENSE.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.827
WE'RE NOT MARRIED IN A SPIRITUAL
SENSE OR A SEXUAL SENSE

06:50.910 --> 06:54.163
OR A PRETENDING-TO-LISTEN-
TO-LONG-BORING-STORIES SENSE.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.332
- SIMON, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

06:56.415 --> 06:58.334
- LOOK, I WAS FILMING
THE CIVIL WAR IN HER COUNTRY.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.461
YESENIA WAS ALONE
AND ABANDONED.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.713
THE REBELS WERE
TAKING OVER THE CITY.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.966
THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET HER OUT
OF THE COUNTRY WAS TO MARRY HER.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.384
- HE WAS SO KIND.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.511
HE TOOK ME, EVEN THOUGH
IN MY COUNTRY

07:08.594 --> 07:10.847
I'M PAST THE AGE OF MARRIAGE
AND NO MAN WOULD WANT ME.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.973
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.850
- 23.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.563
- YESENIA,
COULD WE HAVE A MOMENT?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.984
LOOK, JOY,
NOTHING HAS TO CHANGE.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.403
WE CAN STILL GET MARRIED,
EVENTUALLY,

07:25.486 --> 07:28.156
AS SOON AS YESENIA
CAN STAY HERE LEGALLY.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.032
UNTIL THEN,
JUST FOR IMMIGRATION,

07:30.116 --> 07:32.493
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE OUR MAID.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.537
- YOUR MAID?!
- IT'S JUST A TITLE.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.415
WE'LL ALL PITCH IN TOGETHER.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.876
SO WE'RE GOOD?
- NO!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.586
WHAT REALLY INFURIATES ME

07:41.669 --> 07:43.379
IS YOU DOING SOMETHING
SO UTTERLY STUPID

07:43.462 --> 07:45.923
AND HUMANITARIAN

07:46.007 --> 07:47.884
THAT I CAN'T GET MAD
WITHOUT FEELING LIKE A JERK.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.511
- THEN LET'S JUST
MOVE PAST THE ANGER

07:50.595 --> 07:52.054
AND GO STRAIGHT
TO THE MAKEUP SEX.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.099
- MAKEUP SEX?
SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.602
SHOULD WE ASK YOUR SEXY,
YOUNG WIFE TO JOIN US?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.938
- I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
A TRICK QUESTION.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.608
IT'S A JOKE!

08:06.652 --> 08:09.238
- OKAY, VICTORIA,
YOU ARE THE QUEEN

08:09.322 --> 08:10.781
WAITING FOR
THE REPUBLIC'S AMBASSADOR,

08:10.865 --> 08:12.700
PLAYED BY BRAD PITT,

08:12.783 --> 08:14.577
WHO HAS JUST LANDED
ON YOUR PLANET.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.080
- UH, ABOUT MY COSTUME--

08:18.164 --> 08:21.083
- NO, NO, THAT'S JUST
THE MOTION CAPTURE SUIT.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.960
YOUR CHARACTER WILL BE
DIGITALLY RENDERED IN POST.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.420
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S GET STARTED.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.464
- BUT BRAD ISN'T HERE YET.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.257
- OH, NO, MR. PITT'S NOT COMING
TO NEW YORK.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.052
SEE, THE BEAUTY
OF THESE SPECIAL EFFECTS IS,

08:31.135 --> 08:32.553
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE
IN THE SAME COUNTRY.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.014
- BUT I CAN'T FILM A LOVE SCENE
WITHOUT MY LOVER.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.058
- VERN.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.770
- HE'S BRAD PITT?

08:41.854 --> 08:44.440
- NO, NO.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.983
THAT'S BRAD PITT.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.735
- A TENNIS BALL?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.779
- WE'LL CGI BRAD IN LATER.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.615
THIS TENNIS BALL REPRESENTS
THE FUTURE OF YOUR RACE.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.116
NOW, MAKE LOVE TO IT.

08:56.494 --> 09:00.122
- I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE TENNIS BALL.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.583
- YOU WANT A CUPCAKE?
THEY'RE FROM FILM NEW YORK.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.960
- WHAT'S THAT?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.419
- THAT'S
THE CITY FILM COMMISSION.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.421
THE CITY GETS
A COUPLE THOUSAND JOBS.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.924
WE GET TAX BREAKS.
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.636
- OH, A POLITICIAN
THAT BRINGS IN THAT MANY JOBS

09:13.719 --> 09:17.682
COULD SURE SHUT UP
A BRAGGY MAYOR.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.308
- WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.311
- ELKA OSTROVSKY.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.355
FILM CLEVELAND.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.317
- ALL RIGHT, AND ACTION!

09:28.401 --> 09:30.152
- OH, I LOVE YOU.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
KISS ME.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.662
VERN!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.664
- CUT!

09:41.747 --> 09:43.082
VICTORIA, WHAT'S WRONG?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.709
- WHAT'S WRONG?

09:44.792 --> 09:47.712
I'M KISSING A TENNIS BALL.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.338
- MAYBE IT'LL HELP YOU
GET INTO IT

09:49.422 --> 09:50.840
IF I CAN SHOW YOU THE MODEL
OF YOUR CHARACTER.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.300
- OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.344
I WAS PICTURING
A SEXY ZOE SALDANA TYPE,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.138
YOU KNOW, LIKE FROM <i> AVATAR.</i>

09:57.221 --> 09:58.180
- THIS IS YOU.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.349
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.810
WE EVEN GAVE IT SOME
OF YOUR FACIAL FEATURES

10:02.893 --> 10:05.563
SO PEOPLE WILL FOREVER ASSOCIATE
YOU WITH THE CHARACTER.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.816
- MIRREN!

10:13.571 --> 10:15.948
- IS THAT A DIARY?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.326
- DIARIES ARE FOR GIRLS,
MELANIE.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.493
THIS IS A JOURNAL.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.954
A SEX JOURNAL.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.040
I'VE KEPT TRACK
OF EVERY CONQUEST

10:24.123 --> 10:27.543
SINCE I WAS
A WIDE-EYED 24-YEAR-OLD.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.295
- YOU'RE ON PAGE THREE?

10:31.547 --> 10:33.716
- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
MY FIRST JOURNAL.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.010
- IT SAYS "VOLUME ONE"
RIGHT THERE ON THE COVER.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.680
OH, WELL.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.098
I GET TWO THUMBS UP, HUH?

10:41.182 --> 10:44.769
- OH, THOSE ARE NOT THUMBS.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.152
- WHAT DOES "BPSE" MEAN?

10:53.235 --> 10:55.112
- BEST PITY SEX EVER.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.115
- OH, BOB, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CALL IT PITY SEX.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.576
- HOW ELSE
COULD I DESCRIBE IT?

11:00.659 --> 11:03.245
I FELT SORRY FOR YOU.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.872
- WAIT.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.750
YOU THINK YOU HAD PITY SEX
WITH ME?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.585
NO, NO, NO.
I HAD PITY SEX WITH YOU,

11:09.668 --> 11:12.254
BECAUSE I FELT SORRY FOR YOU
BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER HAVE JOY.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.256
- AND I PLAN TO CHANGE THAT.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.592
NOW MORE THAN EVER, I REALIZE
THAT JOY IS THE ONE FOR ME.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.303
SEX WITH YOU CONFIRMED THAT.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.600
- WELL, MY AGENT CONFIRMED IT.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.602
MIRREN TRICKED ME
INTO TAKING THAT MOVIE

11:26.685 --> 11:29.438
SO SHE COULD STEAL MY PART
IN THAT HBO SERIES.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.441
- MY ADVICE, VICTORIA,
IS TO LET IT GO.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.652
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.488
NO, I SHOULD QUIT THE MOVIE,
DESTROY MIRREN,

11:37.571 --> 11:39.490
AND TAKE BACK
WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.327
I NEED SOMETHING UNDERHANDED
AND DEVIOUS.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.789
OH, WWLD.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.749
WHAT WOULD LUCCI DO?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.251
I SHOULD CALL HER.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.628
- YOU'RE GONNA CALL
YOUR OLDEST ENEMY?

11:52.711 --> 11:55.131
- FIRST OF ALL,
MY OLDEST ENEMY IS TIME.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.301
AND SECOND,
YOU KNOW THE SAYING,

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE

12:01.053 --> 12:03.431
AND YOUR ENEMY OF YOUR FRIEND

12:03.514 --> 12:06.058
AS CLOSE AS THE FRIEND
OF YOUR ENEMY EVEN CLOSER.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.353
- THIS'LL CHEER YOU UP.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.231
EVERYONE IN TOWN LOVES
MY FILM CLEVELAND PLAN.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.233
- WHY WOULD THAT CHEER ME UP?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.776
- BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE SPOKESPERSON.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.611
- I DIDN'T AGREE TO THAT.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.864
- BUT IT'S A WIN-WIN.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.824
I BRING FILM JOBS TO CLEVELAND

12:21.907 --> 12:23.576
AND STICK IT TO THE MAYOR.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.662
- AND WHAT DO I GET?

12:26.745 --> 12:30.082
- I SAID IT WAS WIN-WIN,
NOT WIN-WIN-WIN.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.007
- SIMON'S ALREADY MARRIED.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.467
- MARRIED?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.178
- THE WHOLE TIME
HE WAS PROPOSING TO ME,

12:42.261 --> 12:44.054
HE WAS ALREADY MARRIED
TO ANOTHER WOMAN. I HATE HIM!

12:44.138 --> 12:47.266
- THAT BASTARD.
- SON OF A BITCH.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.310
- I CAN'T HATE HIM.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.145
THE WOMAN IS FROM
A WAR-RAVAGED COUNTRY,

12:51.228 --> 12:52.980
AND HE MARRIED HER
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.523
- OH, HE SAVED HER LIFE.
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.650
- IT'S NOT SWEET!

12:56.734 --> 12:59.236
HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME FIRST,
BUT HE JUST THINKS OF HIMSELF.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.363
- OH, WHO DOES THAT?
- SO SELF-CENTERED.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
- NOT TOTALLY SELF-CENTERED.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.742
I JUST TOLD YOU,
HE SAVED A LIFE.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.660
- OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.288
WHICH OPINION SHOULD WE ECHO
AND PRETEND IS OUR OWN?

13:11.665 --> 13:14.376
- THIS MORNING I WAS GETTING
MARRIED TO THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.880
AND NOW, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE IS
MARRIED TO A HOT 23-YEAR-OLD,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.924
AND HE EXPECTS ME
TO WAIT FOR HIM.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.217
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.551
- JOY.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.470
- SIMON.
- I LOVE YOU.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.722
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
- I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.890
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT
EITHER.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.391
- I'M GETTING A DIVORCE.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.893
- I'M LISTENING.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.151
- I'LL START DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS
RIGHT AWAY.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.195
IT'LL BE JUST THE TWO OF US,
JUST YOU AND ME.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.738
- REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.073
- TO THE BEDROOM,
FUTURE WIFE!

13:44.156 --> 13:46.909
- OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.410
- YES, IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.745
TO THE BEDROOM!

13:49.828 --> 13:51.872
- OH, NO, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT YESENIA?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.583
- OH. OH, SHE'LL BE OKAY.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.919
I PROMISE.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT SOMEHOW.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.255
TO THE BEDROOM!
- YES! NO, WAIT.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.382
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SOMEHOW"?

14:01.465 --> 14:03.926
- LOOK, JOY, AFTER YEARS
AND YEARS APART,

14:04.009 --> 14:05.928
WE'RE FINALLY GETTING
OUR HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.097
CAN WE JUST ENJOY THE MOMENT?
- YES.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.434
- HELLO.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.479
- YESENIA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:15.563 --> 14:17.940
- UH, MAYBE PUT ME DOWN NOW.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.443
- I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT I'VE JUST HEARD

14:21.527 --> 14:22.778
THAT MY FATHER'S BEEN ARRESTED.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.030
I HAVE TO GO BACK HOME.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.782
IN MY COUNTRY, I CAN'T TRAVEL
WITHOUT MY HUSBAND.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.620
- OF COURSE YOUR HUSBAND
WILL GO WITH YOU.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.247
- OH, THANK YOU.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.124
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?

14:37.918 --> 14:39.003
- JOY.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.671
- IF YOU DON'T GO BACK
TO HELP HER,

14:40.754 --> 14:43.424
YOU'LL HATE YOURSELF,
AND I'LL HATE MYSELF.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.426
- LOOK, I'LL--I'LL GO
AND I'LL COME BACK TO YOU

14:45.509 --> 14:47.177
AS SOON AS I CAN,
AND THEN WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.179
- OH, SIMON.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.684
- I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE,
HAVEN'T I?

14:53.767 --> 14:56.478
- YES, YOU HAVE.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.522
MANY TIMES.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.858
IT'S YOUR PATTERN.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.776
YOU'RE IMPULSIVE
AND UNPREDICTABLE.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.154
- AND YOU LOVE THAT ABOUT ME.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.364
- I DO.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.617
BUT I DON'T LOVE IT ABOUT US.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.994
IT'S ALWAYS VERY EXCITING,

15:12.077 --> 15:15.497
BUT IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.542
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.961
- I'M SAYING
I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.424
YOU'RE GREAT
AT THE GRAND GESTURE.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.635
BUT RELATIONSHIPS
ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

15:27.718 --> 15:29.720
AFTER THE GRAND GESTURE.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.930
IT'S THE LITTLE EVERYDAY MOMENTS
IN BETWEEN

15:32.014 --> 15:33.849
THAT MAKE UP A LIFE,

15:33.932 --> 15:36.602
AND THAT'S NOT YOU.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.272
- I CAN CHANGE.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.860
I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE, TOO,
HAVEN'T I?

15:44.943 --> 15:47.071
- YES.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.036
- SO THIS IS IT?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.455
- WE HAVE A SON AND A GRANDSON
TOGETHER.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.542
WE'LL ALWAYS BE
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES, AND...

16:02.127 --> 16:04.129
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.131
- I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.052
GOOD-BYE, JOY.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.972
- GOOD-BYE, SIMON.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.467
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I THINK I AM.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.636
OR AT LEAST I WILL BE.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.596
HE'LL ALWAYS BE MY FIRST LOVE,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.432
BUT I KNOW I MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.183
- OF COURSE YOU DID, SWEETIE.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.811
- YOU KNOW, IF SOMETHING LIKE
THIS HAD HAPPENED IN MY 20s,

17:00.894 --> 17:02.980
I'D BE DEPRESSED
AND IN BED FOR A MONTH.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.356
BUT NOW--
- IN YOUR 30s.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.318
- YES. SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS,

17:08.402 --> 17:09.944
I KNOW I'LL BE OKAY.

17:10.028 --> 17:13.656
IN SOME WAYS,
I THINK YOU GUYS

17:13.741 --> 17:17.453
ARE THE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP
I WAS DESTINED FOR.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.872
- I WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.962
- GOOD, YOU'RE ALL HERE.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.131
JOY, I HAVE TWO THINGS
TO TELL YOU,

17:29.214 --> 17:30.799
AND IT'S BEST
THAT THERE ARE WITNESSES.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.427
FIRST, A CONFESSION.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.929
WHEN MELANIE TOLD ME THE NEWS,
SHE WAS SO SAD

17:36.013 --> 17:39.141
THAT I MADE LOVE TO HER
OUT OF PITY.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.644
- I PITIED YOU!

17:42.728 --> 17:44.646
- SAYS THE SINGLE,
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

17:44.730 --> 17:46.398
TO THE SUCCESSFUL BACHELOR.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.320
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

17:51.403 --> 17:52.946
- BECAUSE I NEVER WANT THERE
TO BE ANYTHING

17:53.030 --> 17:56.158
BUT ABSOLUTE HONESTY BETWEEN US,
JOY.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.993
AND SECONDLY,
NOW THAT I'M DONE

17:58.076 --> 18:00.120
COMFORTING MELANIE...

18:01.330 --> 18:03.499
I'LL BE DEVOTING MYSELF
SOLELY TO YOU

18:03.582 --> 18:06.335
BECAUSE SOME DAY
SIMON WILL SLIP UP,

18:06.418 --> 18:08.170
AND ON THAT DAY,

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
I WILL BE THERE FOR YOU.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.131
- SHE JUST DUMPED SIMON.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.050
- THEN AS FIRST RUNNER-UP,

18:13.133 --> 18:15.135
I GUESS I'LL BE ASSUMING
HIS DUTIES.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.681
- NO, YOU DON'T GET TO
AUTOMATICALLY MARRY JOY

18:19.765 --> 18:21.308
JUST BECAUSE
SHE DIDN'T CHOOSE SIMON.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.894
- YOU KNOW, I FIND IT SAD
THAT MOST AMERICANS

18:23.977 --> 18:26.063
DON'T EVEN KNOW
THEIR OWN LAWS.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.859
- YOU'RE VERY SWEET, BOB,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.945
BUT I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
FOR ANY HUSBAND RIGHT NOW.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.697
- I GET IT.
AND THAT'S SMART.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.491
THROW YOURSELF
INTO YOUR WORK.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.701
- AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO YOU?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.663
- OH, I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.040
I BOUGHT BACK THE DETECTIVE
AGENCY FROM MITCH.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.209
HE REALLY HATES YOU.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.380
- YOU TWO WORKING TOGETHER,
WON'T THAT BE AWKWARD?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.257
- AT FIRST.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.217
BUT THEN IT'LL TURN
TO MILD DISCOMFORT,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.761
THEN TO AMUSED TOLERANCE,

18:57.845 --> 19:00.764
AND NATURALLY, TO LOVE.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.394
AND, MELANIE, I KNOW
YOU'RE HURTING RIGHT NOW--

19:05.477 --> 19:07.563
- OKAY, YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW.
- THAT'S RIGHT, MELANIE,

19:07.646 --> 19:09.606
YOU BE STRONG.
YOU HIDE YOUR PAIN, MELANIE.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.075
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

19:20.158 --> 19:22.703
- HELEN MIRREN WAS IN
A FREAK ACCIDENT IN LONDON.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.956
SOMEONE PUSHED HER
INTO THE THAMES.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.250
- THE INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED
ON CAMERA

19:28.333 --> 19:30.419
BY CCTV.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.920
- OH, DEAR.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.050
- DOCTORS SAY
MIRREN IS UNHARMED

19:37.134 --> 19:39.595
BUT, SHAKEN BY THE INCIDENT,
HAS OPTED OUT

19:39.678 --> 19:41.722
OF HER FORTHCOMING HBO SERIES.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.433
- SOMEONE PUSHED HER
INTO THE RIVER!

19:44.516 --> 19:46.059
WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

19:46.143 --> 19:49.187
- I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE!

19:50.898 --> 19:52.608
- DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT

19:52.691 --> 19:53.942
THAT YOU'RE CARRYING
A HARRODS BAG

19:54.026 --> 19:55.444
AND HELEN MIRREN
JUST FELL INTO THE THAMES?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.446
- IT DOES.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.323
I GOT MY HBO PART BACK.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.949
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE PLAN,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.451
BUT LUCCI WANTED
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.953
OH, LOOK,

20:05.037 --> 20:07.623
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IT ON TV.
OH, TURN IT UP.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.625
- MIRREN WAS PULLED
FROM THE THAMES

20:09.708 --> 20:11.835
BY AMERICAN ACTRESS
SUSAN LUCCI.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.298
- WHAT? WHAT? THAT--THAT WASN'T
PART OF THE PLAN.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.759
- A GRATEFUL MIRREN
HAS PROMISED TO CAST LUCCI

20:18.842 --> 20:20.302
IN HER NEXT FILM

20:20.385 --> 20:23.305
DIRECTED BY MARTIN SCORSESE.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.474
COULD AN OSCAR FOR LUCCI
BE THE REWARD

20:25.557 --> 20:27.309
FOR HER HEROIC ACT?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.770
- MIRREN!

20:29.853 --> 20:31.480
LUCCI!

20:31.563 --> 20:34.024
MIRUCCI!
