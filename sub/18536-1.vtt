29:30.800 --> 29:32.643
(GROANS)

29:32.760 --> 29:33.921
Up.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.925
If we wanted him dead he would be,
now you, you I said I'd cut.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.923
DALEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.446
Mooks wouldn't want blood
on the Indian marble, would he?

29:46.120 --> 29:47.724
It's Indian.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.406
Right, you lot go
and do whatever it is you lot do.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.761
Let me speak with our guest.

29:57.920 --> 30:02.130
Now I've just done you a favour,
so I'm hoping you'll agree to behave.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.925
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let's go for a walk.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.406
Ever hear of the Daley family?

30:14.520 --> 30:15.681
Mob out of Essex.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.762
Used to be run
by all the birds in the family,

30:17.840 --> 30:20.081
people used to call us the Daley Females.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.528
I mean, never to our faces,
no they weren't brave enough for that.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.083
And then I came along.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.329
And do you know what that makes me?

30:30.760 --> 30:31.921
Well?

30:33.400 --> 30:34.447
A cunt.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.766
(CHUCKLES)

30:37.440 --> 30:38.646
The Daley Male.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.966
Get it?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.605
And now I run it all.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.409
Well, me and Mooks,

30:46.520 --> 30:50.241
and there's a reason I'm telling you
all this, but we'll get to that.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.408
(LAUGHS)

30:53.520 --> 30:55.885
Got a bit about you boy, ain't you?

30:55.960 --> 30:57.450
I like it.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.364
Now the one with the Stanley knives
is called Hugs

30:59.440 --> 31:02.284
cos he likes to cuddle people
when he stabs them,

31:02.400 --> 31:04.243
and he's a horrible little bastard.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.971
Now he used to work for Mister
when he was younger.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.809
Who are you talking about?

31:09.920 --> 31:11.285
The Chakra.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.725
Huh?

31:13.800 --> 31:16.770
Never mind mate,
it's just something they used to say.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.080
- (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV)
- (SIGHS)

31:21.520 --> 31:23.284
Still thinking about that club card?

31:24.760 --> 31:25.841
Huh?

31:26.920 --> 31:28.763
Oh, oh, um...

31:29.400 --> 31:30.606
Yeah.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.964
Yeah, I think it was a good deal, you know.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.649
Just go and pick it up tomorrow.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.920
I think it was one of those
one day only things.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.004
Yeah, you know what, I might just go
get one of them now, you know, I think.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.721
Yeah, I think I might just do that now, be...
I won't be long, OK? See you later.

31:48.800 --> 31:53.806
Anything that people want, we can facilitate,
and I need people to run it for me.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.922
Imported foreign slags.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.126
Do whatever I tell them.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.401
- (SNAPS FINGERS)
- You.

32:04.640 --> 32:05.971
You want to fuck one?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.924
No? All right.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.920
I fucked them all.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.605
I love a foreign slag.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.125
Mooks won't fuck them though.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.446
He won't touch this lot.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.762
He likes them high class escorts,

32:20.840 --> 32:23.161
and he must have fucked
everyone in Kensington.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.765
He fucks them,
then beats the shit out of them,

32:25.840 --> 32:28.161
and I mean it's nasty
but what are they going to do?

32:28.240 --> 32:30.685
I just want to know
who's messing with my family.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.285
Scared, ain't you?

32:32.400 --> 32:36.245
See, things have changed
since you was a fucking bad boy,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.205
it's all about the money now,

32:38.280 --> 32:40.925
and me, I've got a few million
in a safe at home.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.083
So I ain't got to worry about which one
of my muscle is gonna stab me in the back,

32:44.160 --> 32:46.845
cos I pay them well enough
to do what I tell them.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.921
See people don't speak about
what they see in here,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.845
cos well I might be smiling, boy,

33:02.920 --> 33:05.082
but no one fucks with me or Mooks.

33:05.960 --> 33:09.089
Anyway, back to my point.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.524
Opportunity.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.922
You come work for me
and I'll change shit for you.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.524
Your kids, that little
chocolate wife you've got,

33:19.120 --> 33:20.963
I'll make the madness stop.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.605
So what do you think?

33:27.400 --> 33:28.447
No.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.691
All right.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.124
Down the stairs, turn right,
through the double doors.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.243
You remember me, boy?

34:32.239 --> 34:34.811
I had a lot of time to think

34:34.920 --> 34:38.885
about what I was going to do to you
when I got out of jail.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.121
My brother was nothing to do with that.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.161
So just tell me what I need to do
to make this stop and I'll do it.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.205
(CHUCKLES)

34:48.280 --> 34:49.850
Where are you?

34:51.080 --> 34:52.605
Well I'm here, you made me come here.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.920
No, no.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.926
Where are you?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.525
(JAMAICAN ACCENT) "Where gone? You get me?"

35:01.600 --> 35:03.921
I don't talk like that any more.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.241
- Why not?
- I grew up.

35:08.320 --> 35:12.120
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose."

35:12.600 --> 35:13.931
Remember?

35:15.160 --> 35:17.766
Where is he?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.962
I know he's still in there.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.767
That's who I want.

35:33.080 --> 35:36.323
I'm not playing this game with you
so leave my family alone.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.086
It's interesting you say those words,
"My family".

35:41.000 --> 35:45.365
Because I have no family
and that's your fault,

35:45.440 --> 35:46.930
so now,

35:47.600 --> 35:50.444
I have nothing to lose.

35:53.640 --> 35:58.601
Everything you've take from me,
Trevor, everything else,

35:58.680 --> 36:00.444
I want it back.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.241
(CHUCKLES)

36:05.280 --> 36:06.325
But I...

36:06.400 --> 36:09.449
I don't want to take this on.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.365
I want the rude boy back,

36:13.440 --> 36:18.651
the youth that dared to take me on,
because this is only gonna end one way.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.921
Look.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.129
Times change.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.765
People change.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.286
No matter how many times you're told,

36:30.400 --> 36:33.085
you never really get it
when you're young, but you learn.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.970
People that were so important
in your life for whatever reason

36:38.080 --> 36:40.526
disappear and new people take their place.

36:42.160 --> 36:47.121
But, you know, it's weird how
through all of that you can do this one thing

36:47.240 --> 36:49.925
that people think defines what you're about.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.289
And it doesn't matter if you're sorry,

36:55.400 --> 36:59.121
it doesn't even matter if you embrace it
as a part of who you are.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.925
No matter how much you try to move on,

37:02.000 --> 37:03.764
no matter how much you try to evolve,

37:03.840 --> 37:06.161
no matter how much you try
to dull the memory of it

37:06.240 --> 37:08.845
or explain to people
that you've improved as a person,

37:08.920 --> 37:10.809
they always try and drag you back in.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.364
And I remember what I said,
I remember I said,

37:15.440 --> 37:18.683
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose,"

37:18.760 --> 37:20.444
but I was wrong.

37:21.760 --> 37:26.084
Because the only person more dangerous
than someone with nothing to lose...

37:33.400 --> 37:35.971
Is someone who stands to lose everything.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.604
(SLURPING)

37:40.760 --> 37:43.885
Fuck me, this is great.

37:43.960 --> 37:48.090
It's like watching two fucking
silverback monkeys waiting to fight.

37:49.520 --> 37:53.969
He came to me couple of months ago,
arse hanging out,

37:54.080 --> 37:57.685
I offered him a load of cash,
he didn't want it.

37:57.760 --> 38:01.765
All he wanted was for me
to facilitate him fucking with you.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.565
Well, I don't miss a bargain.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.205
Please don't do this.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.044
No, hold on.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.088
I just offered you a way out.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.925
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, what am I like?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.365
Janette?

38:16.440 --> 38:18.602
Janette, get in here, love.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.649
Hello, Sam.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.603
Sorry, Mick.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.364
How has your day been?

38:26.440 --> 38:28.681
CURTIS: This is just the start.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.763
I'm not done with you.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.081
I'll destroy everything you love.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.125
Fuck.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.565
Fucking what are you like, bruv?

38:47.640 --> 38:49.130
Go on, cuz.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.811
What, you want to try that again
without your pool balls, cuz?

38:53.920 --> 38:55.410
- Just let him go.
- Shut up.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.682
Yo fam, you're old cuz,
go look after your grandkids.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.967
- You has-been.
- (LAUGHS)

39:00.920 --> 39:03.161
Just get out of my way, blud.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.565
- Did you just say "blud"?
- (LAUGHING)

39:08.640 --> 39:10.925
No one says blud any more cuz, like...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.923
What year you living in?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.446
Do you know what? I know,
he wants to fuck with the young'uns

39:15.600 --> 39:18.251
like he's some fucking
Rolf Harris or something.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.925
Fuck you.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.525
Hey!

39:22.600 --> 39:25.365
What, you'll get your chin lifted
around here bruv.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.761
You can't do fuck all to me.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.527
It was me who shot your brother,
what the fuck are you going to do about that?

39:33.080 --> 39:34.525
Hugs! Hugs!

39:58.400 --> 39:59.447
(GRUNTS)

40:03.760 --> 40:04.761
Leave him.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.921
Going to bang my mouth are you's?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.045
Leave him. Get off.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.165
He's just banged me in my face,
he's not going to hold a shot no?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.321
He's got to hold a couple shots at least.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.085
Oi, move, move. Oi, back up! Back up!

40:13.160 --> 40:15.811
Get back. Or I'll heat up in here, yeah?

40:15.920 --> 40:19.083
Mine's a shotter. A shotter.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.205
Come on, come on, come on.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.325
Is that a sonic hat?

40:21.400 --> 40:22.845
Go, go, go.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.246
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

40:28.000 --> 40:29.001
That's a shotter you know.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.081
Fucking hell.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.205
That was a mad thing, we fucked him up.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.441
Why did you let him up?

40:32.600 --> 40:34.443
Bruv he had a strap bruv,
I was about to get bursted.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.885
What, the guy in the suede shoes
and the fucking lumberjack shirt?

40:36.960 --> 40:39.765
- I don't know, you never know these days cuz.
- You prick. Come here.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.081
What the fuck are you doing cuz?

40:42.160 --> 40:43.286
- What are you doing?
- Fucking little Muppet.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.561
Nah. Nah, nah.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.130
What the fuck bruv?

40:46.240 --> 40:48.205
Come here, come here. Come here.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.327
Hey.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.603
Did you give them the finger?

40:55.680 --> 40:56.725
What about you?

40:56.800 --> 40:58.685
Back up before I heat it up,
what are you fucking cooking?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.885
I don't know what kids say these days.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.611
- I just wanted to get you out.
- What kind of getaway car is this?

41:03.691 --> 41:06.275
This is not a getaway car,
this is a family car.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.525
I've got the child seat in the back,

41:08.600 --> 41:12.446
a ninja turtle I pretended was a gun,
and this is my son's hat.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.807
So how about "Thank you
for coming to get me," huh?

41:14.920 --> 41:16.809
How about that?

41:16.920 --> 41:17.921
Thank you.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.410
By the way if your son's hat fits you
it's definitely your kid.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.165
Are you trying to say I've got a big head?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.686
Or you trying to say my son's got a big head?

41:28.400 --> 41:31.688
Now my cousin Jerry, now he's got a big head.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.242
- I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Fuck you man.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.970
- Come here.
- No bruv you took it too far.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.525
My bad, look I'm sorry,
come here give me a hug.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.602
You're one of my boys, please,
give me a cuddle.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.165
Bruv I know you've got
a fucking shank in your...

41:46.240 --> 41:47.287
Am I a dickhead cuz?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.885
I ain't got nothing in my hands,
I ain't got nothing.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.845
Nothing in my hands. Give me a hug.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.809
- All right man, all right.
- Just come here.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.160
- Come on, come on.
- Fuck off man.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.322
Come on, that's it, yeah.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.687
(SHUSHING)

42:00.400 --> 42:01.401
(GRUNTS)

42:02.160 --> 42:04.766
- Oi, keep your head.
- (COUGHS)

42:11.120 --> 42:13.088
Get in the Jeep.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.005
Get in the fucking Jeep and remember
why you're not on the pavement with him.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.605
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

42:29.400 --> 42:31.084
Get in the Jeep.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.604
FYI, I don't like you either.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.167
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.601
We also acquired some CCTV footage
of the day your mum died.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.929
They were all on it, with Curtis,

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.251
so at best they think
it's a premeditated revenge attack.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.448
DESMOND: I'm the only reason
you're not already in a cell.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.408
I know the people that know the people
that can make all of this go away,

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.364
but we want Curtis.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.285
Daley, Mooks.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.890
Get me one, or all of them, this disappears.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.602
Hey, no heroics.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.650
You know where they are, you call us.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.930
You might want to think of your family.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.290
I am thinking about my family.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.763
I've known you since we were 11 years old.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.122
I'm telling you this as a friend.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.650
This is your last chance.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.247
We done?

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.601
(VIBRATING)

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.567
Yo, Hugs, let's get rid of that
fucker Daley, yeah?

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.451
Daley got away and the one
with the knives is dead.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.044
So how do you want to do this?

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.763
West London waste ground,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.607
in one hour.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.129
Just you and me.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.361
SAM: You happy?

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.401
CURTIS: Not yet.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.401
I want you to lose everything
like I lost everything.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.090
What the fuck did you lose?

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.921
I lost everything.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.366
Lexie.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.404
Kayla's left me, my kids,

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.409
my brother's leaving, my mum's dead.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.130
I lost Trevor.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.090
And I can't take that back.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.771
For 16 years I've wished I could.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.089
If I had one wish, that's all I'd do,
bring back your nephew.

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.726
He was like my son,

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.403
and then you came along.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.921
The only way you leave here today
is by killing me. (CHUCKLES)

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.451
I'm not doing that.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.005
I mean look at us, what are we doing?

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.287
Two black men just fighting
in the street again.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.763
You don't kill me, I'll kill you.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.405
If you wanted to do it,
why didn't you just do it?

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.245
- Why all of this?
- Because I wanted to earn it!

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.371
I wanted the bully that killed my Trevor,

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.769
because if he doesn't get to that gun
before me,

01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.768
after I've killed him
I'm going to kill his family as well.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.201
(GRUNTS)

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.567
Listen, I'm not trying to...

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.967
(GRUNTS)

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.607
(GROANS)

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.407
(GRUNTS)

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.283
- (BONES CRACK)
- (SCREAMS)

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.601
(PANTS)

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.361
(SCREAMS)

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.646
Is this what you want?

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.603
Be careful what you wish for, cuz.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.771
Finish me.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.881
(SCREAMS)

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.401
Jeez!

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.769
Stay the fuck away from my family.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.081
(GROANS)

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.566
(GUNSHOT)

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.131
Armed police! Armed police, get down!

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.769
DESMOND: Secure the weapon, secure the area.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.810
Sam, you need to leave right now.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.685
I told you to tell us where they were,
not have us follow you around.

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.921
- Hey.
- You are fucking nicked!

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.088
Hey, we promised, that's enough.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.201
No, only if he told us where they were.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.806
- I didn't promise anything.
- Rude boy. Rude boy.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.246
The commissioner gave us the orders.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.441
We know exactly what the role was,

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.762
- we've got our guy.
- I don't care. This is bullshit.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.685
- Manor Road...
- Thank you.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.364
- We don't need to arrest him.
- I'm taking him down.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.726
I'm taking him down.

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.291
DESMOND: You're not taking
anyone down, all right.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.970
(CURTIS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.923
DESMOND: Come on move, secure the perimeter.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.246
PARKINSON: Man, this is bullshit.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.409
Sam, run!

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.607
(GRUNTS)

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.449
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.122
I want to know how you thought you were
gonna get away with this?

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.841
What you think you can have my mom killed,

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.809
you can hurt my brother,
you can threaten my fucking family

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.445
and I'm not going to do nothing?

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.770
Are you dizzy, blud?

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.721
What?

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.286
Never mind me.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.763
It's just something I used to say.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.600
That was all Curtis.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.000
I can get you Curtis.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.650
He told me how to find you.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.407
- I can give you money.
- I don't want your fucking money.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.091
Then what the fuck do you want?

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.651
Because I've seen your type before, mouth,

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.404
now you're not going to do anything to me

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.725
because if you do, you know,
you'll never see your family again.

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.930
So either start talking

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.891
or get the fuck out of my place
and we'll leave this where it is.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.200
You're right.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.250
I'm not going to do anything.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.203
Even though I want to,
even after everything you did,

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.442
because you know what,
I love what I have too much to risk it.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.730
You know what?

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.050
Not everyone's like me.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.241
Hey, Daley.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.963
Or should I call you Mooks?

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.091
You're so fucked.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.967
(GUN COCKS)

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.087
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.401
Mum.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.601
Daddy!

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.807
(LAUGHS)

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.450
(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.440
Would you like anything else?

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.890
Just the bill please.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.365
So look, um...

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.651
I'm not perfect.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.251
I'm just...

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.248
You know, I'm just one of those guys.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.603
I'm not going to fuck us up again.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.408
I just need to know that you're my guy.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.125
If I know that,
I'll ride for you every step of the way.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.723
There's nothing more important to me
than you and the kids.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.247
Nothing.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.606
And so all of the drama,

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.081
is it done?

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.969
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.969
- Daddy, funny.
- Let's go.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.245
Ah, man.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.361
(MAN SINGING)

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.761
OK, go listen to this guy.
Go, go, let's go...

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.361
Sam.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.242
Just cleaning up some last little bits.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.049
So this isn't a coincidence, is it?

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.805
No, no coincidence.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.411
I knew you were here.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.123
So what, are you here to take me in,
in front of my family?

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.762
I'm standing here after all these years
and I'm thinking about where our lives are,

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.562
and I'm thinking about how things seemed
so much bigger when we were young,

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.048
yet by actually doing this job

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.610
I see it meant nothing.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.640
That...

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.129
That's all that means anything.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.405
You're free to go.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.082
I make a promise, I keep it.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.408
Friends or not, you will not be getting
any more chances from me,

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.925
do you understand?

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.449
I don't want to see you again...

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.965
Unless,

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.567
Kayla makes that apple crumble
for my birthday, I wouldn't miss that.

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.401
Be good.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.283
Come on. Come on, buddy.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.087
Yeah, babe.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.407
Yeah.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.767
It's done.
