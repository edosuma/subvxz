WEBVTT

02:42.760 --> 02:44.360
Don't look.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.560
Hey, thanks for coming.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.640
-  What happened?
-  Oh, we don't know.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.400
- Is it Gus?
- Yeah.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.800
Listen, that's not why I called.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.840
I found something
that I need to show you both.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.000
Are you... Are you okay?

03:19.680 --> 03:20.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.880
I just need a minute. Would you wait?

03:40.880 --> 03:43.760
You shouldn't be seeing this.
It's horrible, huh?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.080
Um, how are you doing?

03:48.480 --> 03:51.960
- I dreamt about you last night.
- Oh.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.360
Well, it's uh... Um...

03:56.360 --> 03:58.200
You know,
I've been meaning to check up on you.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.200
It's just...
things have gone a bit crazy.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.520
You know? Um...

04:03.520 --> 04:06.400
Well, I have to go.
I have to take care of things.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.800
I'll come by later. Yeah?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.280
Okay.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.240
Are you okay?

04:38.960 --> 04:40.560
Yola.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.200
Yola.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.240
Hello?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.480
Hello?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.760
Don't inhale it. It's deadly.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.160
- How many drums are left?
- Five.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.960
Bring all of 'em.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.480
Uh, what are you doing?

05:15.480 --> 05:17.320
- Killing that crocodile.
- With that?

05:17.320 --> 05:20.240
That is the best poison
money can buy.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.800
Forever Chemicals.
All the way from the USA.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.120
It'll be killing things
long after we're gone.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.000
And you're going
to pour that into the dam?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.680
Oh, yeah.
Kill that fucker once and for all.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.520
Yeah and everyone and everything
that drinks from the dam.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.560
- Okay.
- Genius.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.160
Well, luckily,
we have a borehole, so we're fine.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.200
You're not thinking straight.
You can't pour that into the dam.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.880
They can all stop drinking till
the croc is dead. How's that?

05:41.880 --> 05:43.400
Well, you just said they last forever

05:43.400 --> 05:45.480
and we're not even sure
if it is a croc, Max.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.960
Rudy.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.160
Do you want me to
kill the thing or not?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.120
Yeah. Yeah. I'd like you to kill it

05:51.120 --> 05:53.120
but not the whole Goddamn
town with it you stupid idiot.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.640
Yeah, well--
Don't you ever call me stupid again.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.880
Or have you forgotten that
I fixed your Themba problem, huh?

05:58.880 --> 06:02.000
- Stop acting like a child.
- You stop acting like your father.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.440
Please stop that.
I said stop it, right now.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.920
Wrap it up.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.960
Yes, sir.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.000
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.960
How many more, sir?

06:17.960 --> 06:20.160
He was my friend, too. Okay?

06:21.600 --> 06:24.280
Now come to the hall. You're
gonna be late for the meeting.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.760
- Hm.
- Meetings.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.160
It's always meetings with him.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.880
Get rid of this.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.800
What do you want me to do with it?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.040
I don't know.
Pour it in the drain or something.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.840
What is this place?

07:11.840 --> 07:13.640
This is where you were kept.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.560
Do you remember this?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.640
No.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.400
Well, we found his jacket.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.280
- Whose?
- Themba's.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.640
You think Themba took her?

07:35.440 --> 07:38.400
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know yet.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.520
That doesn't make sense.
He's in love with her.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.360
What about love ever made sense?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.440
Hey, uh...

08:03.440 --> 08:05.160
- I thought you had left.
-  No.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.320
I'm done running.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.560
I did not kidnap Yola.
Charlton, you know this.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.640
Did you tell them the hut is yours?

08:16.640 --> 08:19.560
I uh...
I-- I told them you didn't do it.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.360
Did you tell them about the hut?

08:23.240 --> 08:27.280
Hey, man. What-- What is this, huh?
What are you doing?

08:28.560 --> 08:30.360
It's just weed.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.680
So they'll give you
a slap on the wrist. But me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.520
They'll put me away forever.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.840
Okay? I'll never get to
see my family again.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.520
Hey, look at me, man.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.120
I'm...

08:45.400 --> 08:47.840
Don't make this difficult
for either of us.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
You called them?
I thought you were my friend.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.760
Yola, I need uh...
I need to go do something. Okay?

09:18.760 --> 09:21.040
- Hmm-mm. Hmm-mm.
- Stay in the car.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.440
- Promise me.
- I promise.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.040
Okay.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.920
Yola.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.240
- Two minutes. Okay?
- Mm.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.360
Now we found Gus's body
at the dam today.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.480
That's Gus and Danie.
Two dead in three days.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.440
The wound suggests
something or someone very angry.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.720
Why do you say that?

11:48.720 --> 11:52.840
What else, the fingers?
Don't look. Don't touch.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.760
It feels personal. Pathological.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.560
Sorry, so you saying it's a person?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.600
No,
I'm just saying it looks personal.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.800
No human could have made
wounds like this. This is an animal.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.400
Something has torn open
three of my goats

12:04.400 --> 12:05.480
from their throats to their arsehole.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.040
It's a crocodile.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.240
Okay, okay, please.
Quiet, quiet.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.160
We need one meeting at a time.
Thank you.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.200
Look.
There have been many sightings,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.920
but you all can't seem to
agree on what you saw.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.160
Okay well, what else keeps
dead meat in a lair underwater?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.760
- Huh, genius?
-  It's not a crocodile.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.000
It's Mamlambo.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.120
Sienna, I'm on my way to the meeting.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.280
Annie, please. It won't take long.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.920
It's an emergency.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.920
Okay, give it to me.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.720
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.560
Why not?

13:06.560 --> 13:09.200
This isn't Olly's signature.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.680
It's been forged.
I should call the police.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.280
Come on.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.360
You could help me
if you really wanted to.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.840
How far are you?

13:21.960 --> 13:23.760
I don't know.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.840
Five, six weeks. Tops.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.040
That's against the law and...

13:29.720 --> 13:32.440
- And what?
- It could be my son's child.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.080
It's not Rudy's child.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.360
Or any one of the many men
you sleep with.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.920
I don't know whose child it is.
Or even if it is a child yet.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.800
What I know is it's eating me inside.
And I can't have it.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.800
Well, you should have thought of that
before you slept with half the town.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.880
Wow.

13:50.560 --> 13:55.120
That's why I like you, Annie.
For you, every day is judgement day.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.920
- Okay, if it is her then why now?
- I, I don't know, but it's her.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.960
Yeah, and the tooth fairy
pegged Peter Pan just Thursday.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.000
Let's just stop it.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.720
- Max, behave yourself.
-  Okay, Calm down.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.920
- Calm down.
- No, no, no.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.120
We don't need calm, okay?
We need action.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.240
Why don't you go out
and hunt and kill whatever it is.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.720
Yes.
And we need to find that crocodile,

14:16.720 --> 14:19.040
cut its fucking head off.
Stick it through a pipe.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.360
Yeah, but we don't even know
what and where it is.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.720
You know where it is.
It's in a lair. We found it.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.640
Let's just get some order,
please. Dirk, what do you suggest?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.320
I think we need to
send for reinforcements.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.440
- We need government support.
-  Government assistance?

14:32.440 --> 14:35.720
They couldn't even find boerewors
at a braai, you fucknut.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.160
Okay. Okay, cool.
I agree with Max.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.360
The last thing we need now is

14:39.360 --> 14:41.040
- outsiders meddling in our business.
-  No, no, no, no.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.280
We need to
take care of this ourselves.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.680
No. We need less talking
and more action.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.120
Yes. Yes.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.680
Okay, so here's the plan.
Max, you and Reese and your crew,

14:51.680 --> 14:54.200
you set up patrols and traps
at the dam, alright?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.360
Dirk, you go out
and tell people to stay inside.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.240
We can't lose another person.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.200
Then, Anton.
You go and check out Reese's goats.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.760
See if there's a connection.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.640
So that's the plan.
Let's get to work.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.000
-  Great.
- Max.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.120
Yeah.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.760
Just don't let them
throw the shiny stuff.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.560
- Yeah, it's fine.
- And...

15:14.640 --> 15:16.240
- Be careful.
- Okay.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.280
You too.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.560
Alright. Let's kill that croc.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.200
- Drop that croc!
- Drop that croc!

15:26.200 --> 15:28.160
- Shot that croc!
- Shot that croc!

15:28.160 --> 15:30.480
- Fuck that croc!
- Fuck that croc!

15:59.400 --> 16:01.160
-  Hi.
- Hi.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.160
What are you doing here?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.800
We need to speak Yola.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.000
Oh. Uh, yeah. About what?

16:13.560 --> 16:15.120
About Themba.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
Yeah. Fine.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.440
Yeah, sure. Come in.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.720
- Can I have your advice on something?
- Sure.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.680
Themba needs your help.
It's a setup.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.760
Tell the police
he did not kidnap you.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.360
I can't.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.880
I don't know where I was
or what happened to me.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.320
I know my nephew.
He has the purest of heart.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.800
And he likes you very, very much.
He will never hurt you.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.200
-  I don't want it.
-  Are you sure?

17:05.600 --> 17:07.200
Yeah.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.920
Okay.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.040
I know there's a recipe
with a-- that tree.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.480
- Isikhonyambe.
- Yeah.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.320
Can I have
the rest of the recipe?

17:19.320 --> 17:21.200
Um...

17:23.480 --> 17:25.080
Okay.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.280
- Okay.
- Let's just go to the kitchen.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.120
So you take a handful of that bark, okay?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.280
She's pregnant.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.000
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.800
- Five or six weeks.
- Well, that's it.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.240
That's the reason. That explains it.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.880
- Explains what?
- The attacks.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.320
- What do you mean?
- She's come for blood.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.760
Who's coming for blood?

18:10.400 --> 18:13.480
- Mamlambo.
- Mamlambo?

18:14.360 --> 18:18.640
She wants the child. The blood
of Jacob. It makes perfect sense.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.360
Then we have a problem.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.680
- Why?
- Sienna doesn't want the baby.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.720
Well,
she needs to keep it.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.840
Who's the father?

18:28.840 --> 18:31.320
- I don't think she even knows.
- Oh my God.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.840
Well...

18:36.720 --> 18:40.120
Oh well, so we need Rudy
and her to put pressure on her.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.880
Mm.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.160
The strangest thing happened
outside the store yesterday.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.240
That student of yours.
The one with the yellow raincoat.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.720
Then you take your chopped root...

18:57.600 --> 19:03.320
Just half a litre, okay?
Mix it. Then boil for 15 minutes.

19:04.040 --> 19:07.040
Strain it.
And then you just drink it, okay?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.760
You'll feel very nauseous.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.240
So please...
please don't do it alone.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.120
- Just in case something goes wrong.
- Yeah, no I won't.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.720
Okay.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.160
Thanks.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.840
It is Mamlambo.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.480
Not now, Dora.
I've got a lot going on.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.840
I mean, it's Rudy, it's her.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.160
Now is not the time for superstition.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.760
It is not superstition.
Think about it.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.680
You saw those bodies.

19:44.440 --> 19:49.040
Those wounds were made by no animal
that I've ever seen. And Olly?

19:50.560 --> 19:53.440
- He says it looks personal.
- But people are panicking.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.520
The last thing we need now
is an imaginary monster.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.120
She's real.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.880
And you deny her at your own peril.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.400
We all know you love the idea
of an angry woman spirit thing.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.680
You've got the tattoo to prove it.
But that doesn't make her real.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.360
- She is a myth created to scare--
- He gave his life.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.280
To bring Yola back.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.680
And she brought the rain.

20:21.280 --> 20:25.160
Which broke the drought
which made the rivers flow, which...

20:26.520 --> 20:28.680
Washed the diamonds out.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.760
Yes, I know about the diamonds.

20:33.760 --> 20:38.360
The ones you're so desperate
to get your dirty little hands on.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.240
Do you... really think this is all...

20:44.280 --> 20:45.800
a coincidence?

20:45.800 --> 20:47.960
Okay, if it is her, why now?

20:47.960 --> 20:50.320
Where has she been
for the last 200 years, hmm?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.880
She wants Sienna's baby.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.720
Sienna's pregnant?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.920
Through the door
on your right.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.240
Yola?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.000
I can't believe you came. Thank you.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.960
- Your aunty asked me.
- Oh, yeah. She's hard to refuse.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.480
Yeah.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.600
So you still don't remember anything?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.800
- Nothing?
- Sorry.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.120
It's okay.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.520
You know, I came back
hoping that you'd remember.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.560
That all of this will go away.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.120
Me and you would live happily
ever after and ride into the sunset.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.200
- But it doesn't matter.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.200
It's okay. I... I'll remember.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.840
For the both of us.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.720
I'll never forget
when I came by your house.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.800
You looked so beautiful, Yolanda.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.960
As if you were wearing the moonlight
on your shoulders like a scarf.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.440
And you smiled at me.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.800
I smiled back.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.120
And all I could think about
was just...

22:28.880 --> 22:30.840
kissing you on your lips.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

22:36.960 --> 22:39.760
I didn't mean to
embarrass you.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.720
It's just that I...

22:43.720 --> 22:45.320
I had to leave.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.240
But I couldn't.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.480
The thought of you thinking that
I did those terrible things to you,

22:53.480 --> 22:55.280
I couldn't live with that.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.640
And they'll say a lot of
things about me, Yolanda.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.520
Those are lies.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.440
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.240
I may be a stranger to you.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.640
But to me...

23:12.680 --> 23:14.480
I just want the best for you.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.200
Hey, Yola.
What happened? What did he say?

23:29.360 --> 23:32.520
- He didn't do it.
- Do you remember anything?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.120
No.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.640
No, I just know.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.960
Okay.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.520
- Hey, where are you going?
- Sienna, I just need space.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.320
Okay, just... give me a moment.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.200
Everything feels foggy,
so I just need time to think.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.400
Just be careful, okay?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.440
You too.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.160
Zizi.
It's time for your treatment.

24:13.240 --> 24:16.320
I said, it's time for your treatment.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.560
Come. Won't hurt.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.360
Later Clara.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.800
I don't think he did it.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.720
Well, that's not
what the evidence suggests.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.040
No. The jacket proves nothing.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.960
- It's not just the jacket.
- Well, what evidence is there?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.360
Sienna...

24:57.760 --> 25:01.120
- What other evidence is there?
- This isn't protocol.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.720
- Okay.
- Dirk.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.080
This is my sister.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.040
Please.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.000
We think these are Yola's.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.800
Uh... Could be.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.000
Can I see?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.680
I won't touch it.
I won't touch, just show me.

25:33.360 --> 25:36.480
These are clean.
You can smell the detergent.

25:37.040 --> 25:40.120
And this is underwear
she's supposedly worn for weeks.

25:40.120 --> 25:44.120
- Well, Themba might have washed them.
- In the river? And then ironed them.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.280
He's not your guy.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.680
I believe
congratulations are in order.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.920
What do you mean?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.000
I heard you're going to be a father.

29:19.200 --> 29:24.320
Oh, you are going
away for a long ass time, my brother.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.960
I didn't do it.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.440
You know that.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.080
What I know is irrelevant.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.760
- It's Charlton's hut.
- Well, that's not what he says.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.720
We smoked there once
and I left my jacket.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.760
The underwear was planted.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.440
But you already know that too.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.960
Either way, this is the last time

29:49.960 --> 29:51.640
that you and I
will ever see each other.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.800
So what,
you came here to say goodbye?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.400
Mm-hm.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.520
What do you want?

30:01.400 --> 30:05.000
I'm gonna make you a once-off,
take it or leave it offer.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.800
Where all of this goes away.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.360
- All of it?
- Yeah.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.400
All of it.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.120
Let's see, the kidnapping,
Bernoldus, your friend Victor?

30:19.120 --> 30:23.400
Breaking and entering. Oh, oh,
assaulting Max and even the dagga.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.000
Poof. Gone.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.280
Just like that.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.000
In return for what?

30:31.880 --> 30:33.840
-  Sienna.
- Yeah.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.280
- Is it true?
- What?

30:36.280 --> 30:37.920
That you're pregnant?

30:38.800 --> 30:41.040
- Who told you?
- So, it's true.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.560
Dirk, it's...
It's none of your business.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.360
Of course it's my business. It's...

30:47.440 --> 30:49.040
It's my baby.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.560
This is good.
Why don't we get married?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.160
What?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.760
Marry me.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.040
No, Dirk. I won't.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.640
- Why not?
- Because...

31:05.760 --> 31:07.400
Because I don't want to.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.920
I don't wanna have a baby
and I don't wanna get married.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.800
Especially--
I don't want a mercy proposal. No.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.360
Forget it. But this baby, th...

31:19.960 --> 31:23.320
We could...
We could raise it together. Yeah?

31:23.320 --> 31:25.240
- Co-parent.
- No.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.240
I'm not having it.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.400
You're gonna have
an abortion just like that?

31:34.280 --> 31:36.760
Yeah Dirk, just like that.
I woke up this morning and I thought,

31:36.760 --> 31:39.000
what a perfect day for an abortion.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.840
I...
I don't want you having an abortion.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.400
Dirk, I cannot talk about
what you want right now.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.880
- Where are you taking her?
- Upstairs.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.080
She's cured.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.280
Please, man.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.720
Please.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.480
Hey.
