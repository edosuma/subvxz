00:24.111 --> 00:26.200
Wow! Scarlett just throws
the best parties.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.723
I'm gonna go find Asra.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.681
Then I'll see
who I can find.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.728
There's Victor.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.121

Scarlett.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.190
'Call an ambulance!'

01:00.277 --> 01:01.409
Mom.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.716
No, Oscar, stay up there.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.068
Scarlett.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.635
Look at it, George.

01:10.722 --> 01:13.116
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:13.203 --> 01:14.639
Now relax.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.645
'Don't you feel
happy and relaxed?'

01:20.732 --> 01:22.082
Yes.

01:22.169 --> 01:25.476
Say it.
Tell me how you feel.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.044
Happy and relaxed.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.959
That's good.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.961
That's very good.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.618
So tell me, George.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.576
What's your date
of birth?

01:38.663 --> 01:43.277
I was born on
the 1st of March, 1980.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.322
And what's your
mother's name?

01:45.409 --> 01:46.889
Melody.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.674
That's a very nice name.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.112
She was a good woman.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.766
She liked you to tell
the truth, didn't she, George?

01:54.853 --> 01:56.290
Yes.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.771
So tell me, how did you
murder Donovan--

01:59.858 --> 02:02.470
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt
but we just caught a red ball.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.298
You're gonna be much
longer with this one?

02:04.385 --> 02:05.342
Huh.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.390
Damn it, Jane. He's in
a trance, isn't he?

02:09.477 --> 02:13.307
I-I'd describe it more
as a-a deep relaxation.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.917
Hypnotized.
You hypnotized him.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.180
Well, I was doing a favor
for the organized crime unit.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.790
Those cowboys?

02:18.877 --> 02:20.488
Time to go, guys.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.707
You know, I was just about
to get the truth out of him.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.493
He killed two people. If you
walk very quietly to the door--

02:25.580 --> 02:28.626
How many times have I
told you no hypnotism?

02:28.713 --> 02:30.367
'It's illegal,
and it's unethical'

02:30.454 --> 02:32.021
and you cannot
keep on doing it.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.241
Just calm yourself, woman.
It's no big thing.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.374
Oh, really? This man's lawyer
is right this minute coming

02:37.461 --> 02:39.289
down the hallway,
wearing a mean face.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.597
Something tells me he'll argue
that point with you. Let's go.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.381
Well, let me get him out
of his trance first, huh?

02:44.468 --> 02:45.687
Oh, be quick about it.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.602
Yes, ma'am.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.607
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.652
- Of course.
- Now.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.177
George, nice to talk to you.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.135
Good luck with all
your future endeavors.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.358
'That's mine.'

03:06.664 --> 03:08.797
So, George..

03:08.884 --> 03:11.495
George, are you alright?

03:11.582 --> 03:14.194
- It's not funny.
- It is a little.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.369
What you got?

03:15.456 --> 03:16.718
Unincorporated
country club

03:16.805 --> 03:18.067
development outside of town.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.678
Scarlett Marquesa,
33, female.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.072
[Rigsby]
'Hostess of the party,
married, one kid.'

03:23.159 --> 03:26.162
Right about 10:20 this evening
the party was in full swing.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.816
Scarlett comes running
over the balcony

03:27.903 --> 03:29.252
clutching her throat
and screaming.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.688
She falls down
to her death.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.212
Where's the husband
and the kid?

03:32.299 --> 03:34.214
[Rigsby]
'They're with neighbors
badly shook up.'

03:34.301 --> 03:36.520
'We'll wait to talk to them
until tomorrow morning.'

03:36.607 --> 03:38.957
- Poison, huh?
- Must be.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.655
Frothing at the lips,
discoloration.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.352
Medical examiner
thinks so too.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.136
'But we haven't found
the source yet.'

03:44.224 --> 03:45.921
'I don't know where
she ingested the poison.'

03:46.008 --> 03:47.357
She came from up
there, but the actual

03:47.444 --> 03:48.445
poisoning could've
taken place anywhere.

03:48.532 --> 03:49.577
It's a big house.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.277
Uh, just a moment.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.670
Excuse me.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.544
'That's interesting.'

04:00.631 --> 04:02.329
Look. Look at her eyes.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.244
What?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.945
Hello? Use your words.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.606
She had more mascara on her
right eye than she did on her

04:18.693 --> 04:20.999
left which means that she was
halfway through reapplying

04:21.086 --> 04:23.480
her makeup when
she was poisoned.

04:23.567 --> 04:27.397
So, she was in the..

04:28.180 --> 04:29.660
...bathroom.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.096
Hmm.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.320
'Huh.'

04:37.407 --> 04:38.713
Huh.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.064
The source of the
poison, I have no doubt.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.682
'What do we got here?'

04:58.602 --> 04:59.908
Motive.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.085
[theme music]

05:10.310 --> 05:10.788

05:56.225 --> 05:58.532
Mr. Marquesa,
I'm agent Lisbon, CBI.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.708
Yes, thanks for coming.

06:00.795 --> 06:04.189
These are dear friends,
Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.278
They've been looking
after me and Oscar.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.150
Anything we can do.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.065
Vic, I'll make sure Jim
stops by as soon as

06:10.152 --> 06:11.153
he gets back into town.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.328
Thanks, Mandy.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.330
Take care, Victor.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.512
Please. Come in.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.090
Scarlett kept
everything in here.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.222
Very organized.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.311
We'll get it back to you
just as soon as we can.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.704
Thank you.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.318
The tox screen tells
us your wife's

06:46.406 --> 06:48.190
drink was laced
with rat poison.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.974
[Oscar grunting]

06:50.061 --> 06:51.802
Rat poison?

06:51.889 --> 06:53.064
Oscar.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.326
Oscar.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.198
[grunting]

06:56.285 --> 06:57.286
Who would do such a thing?

06:57.373 --> 06:59.288
Somebody who wanted
to get even?

06:59.375 --> 07:02.117
Who's your guess? Whose name
just popped into your head?

07:02.204 --> 07:04.032
Scarlett had no enemies.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.337
Everyone loved Scarlett.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.383
- Even Asra?
- Asra? Yes.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.951
They got along fine.
Why ask about her?

07:10.038 --> 07:11.996
You're having an affair
with Asra, aren't you?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.129
What? No.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.653
- No? Really?
- No. Really.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.959
And what the heck kind
of police are you anyhow

07:18.046 --> 07:19.569
asking me a question
like that?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.964
- Sorry, my mistake.
- Are you business partners?

07:23.051 --> 07:25.749
- She's my accounts manager.
- Ah, okay. Now I understand.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.882
- Understand what?
- Doesn't matter.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.361
Do you know where
her keys are?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.407
I can't find 'em.
They're not in here.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.409
I couldn't find them,
I wanted to move her car.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.368
Not to worry,
I'm sure they'll show up.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.893
What is it you do
for a living, exactly?

07:38.980 --> 07:42.070
- I develop real estate.
- It's a tough market.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.637
Tell me about it,
but I'm confident

07:43.724 --> 07:45.508
that it'll
turn around soon.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.727
And did Scarlett
work with you?

07:46.814 --> 07:49.512
No, she was
the artistic type.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.471
She made jewelry.
That was her thing.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.168
'Made a pretty good business
out of it in fact.'

07:54.561 --> 07:56.650
Selling to friends
and neighbors.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.521
Well, what kind
of jewelry was it?

07:58.608 --> 07:59.957
- Was it expensive stuff?
- No.

08:00.044 --> 08:03.526
Just trinkets, really.
Earrings, bracelets.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.137
Can we see some?

08:06.224 --> 08:07.661
Sure.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.414
Hmm.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.242
That's very nice.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.810
Was there any particular reason
for the party last night?

08:26.897 --> 08:29.204
Scarlett's idea.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.336
She, um, thought it
was necessary to let

08:31.423 --> 08:33.469
people know we're
doing fine.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.776
And we are...doing fine.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.561
Did anybody at the party
behave in an unusual manner?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.911
- 'Any odd incidents?'
- No.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.218
And you knew everybody
at the party personally?

08:43.305 --> 08:44.741
Yes, good friends.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.614
- 'Oh, we're gonna need a list.'
- Sure.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.007
From the country club mostly.

08:50.094 --> 08:53.968
Scarlett was elected chair
of her women's committee there.

08:54.055 --> 08:57.145
'It's a big deal in this
community, very prestigious.'

08:57.232 --> 08:58.973
I was so proud of her

08:59.060 --> 09:02.803
but it meant she had to spend
a lot more time at the club.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.066
[Oscar grunting]

09:05.153 --> 09:07.155
Oscar, stop.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.114
Please.
Pardon me.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.161
- Um, are we done here?
- 'Yeah, that's all for now.'

09:13.248 --> 09:16.860
We'll be in touch
if we need anything else.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.383
Very nice.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.133
What's your deal
with Asra Hadami?

09:29.220 --> 09:32.180
Well, you saw the dinner theater
way in which she hugged Victor.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.008
She's deceiving him.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.010
I thought it was a love affair
gone awry but it isn't.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.402
It's something else.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.927
She's probably
stealing from him.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.537
I'll have Van Pelt
pull her financials

09:41.624 --> 09:43.800
at the same time she
pulls the Marquesas'.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.889
Yeah, we should go take
a look at this country club.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.891
Yeah, talk to the women's
committee she chairs.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.153
Bring Rigsby with you.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.465
[indistinct chattering]

09:57.684 --> 10:00.034
Someone here
knows the truth.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.645
Oh, and how so?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.604
Oh, poison and a message
in lipstick

10:04.691 --> 10:06.997
says this murder
was done by a woman.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.391
Women have no secrets
from other women.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.437
Well, unless it was a cunning
man posing as a woman.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.004
You think?

10:14.091 --> 10:15.440
No.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.356
[indistinct chattering]

10:23.144 --> 10:25.407
[female announcer]
'Semifinal pairs,
players 23 and 45'

10:25.494 --> 10:28.758
to court one now, please.
23 and 45 to court one.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.152
Good morning, ma'am. California
Bureau of Investigation.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.457
'Detective Rigsby.
This is Jane.'

10:32.544 --> 10:35.460
Hi, Heather.
Nice to meet you.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.115
Everyone's been expecting you.
Poor Scarlett.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.726
It's terrible.
How can I help you?

10:39.813 --> 10:41.075
We'd like to start
by talking

10:41.162 --> 10:41.728
to members of
the women's committee.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.381
Sure thing.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.427
Uh, perhaps we'd, uh,
gather them more discreetly?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.821
Oh, everyone will know
in minutes anyhow.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.127
Jackie, Patience, Mandy,
the police are here

10:50.214 --> 10:52.086
'and they want to talk to us
about Scarlett's murder.'

10:52.173 --> 10:53.914
Come to the rose courtyard

10:54.001 --> 10:56.133
and, everybody, the silent
auction closes shortly

10:56.220 --> 10:58.266
so get those bids
in now, folks.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.835
I'll show you the way.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.011
I love a silent auction.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.971
So, uh, let's start
with some names.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.756
'Uh, Patience Broadbent.'

11:09.843 --> 11:11.758
- 'Mandy Riljek, you've met.'
- Hi.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.195
- Jackie Shaper.
- Hi.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.849
Thank God you're here.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.068
You're gonna find
this maniac, won't you?

11:18.155 --> 11:20.810
We'll try. Uh, were you all
at Scarlett's party?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.159
- Yes.
- 'Yes.'

11:22.246 --> 11:23.465
We all have to go to
the chairwoman's parties

11:23.552 --> 11:25.119
it's a rule.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.773
Chairwoman is a prestigious
position, isn't it?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.600
[Mandy]
'Oh, yes, it is.'

11:28.688 --> 11:32.082
She would make her fair share
of enemies I'd expect.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.303
[scoffs]
You could say that.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.348
If you have somethin'
to say, say it.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.089
Speak your mind, bitch.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.049
Oh, okay. You want
it all out there?

11:42.136 --> 11:45.269
He asked about enemies,
and that's what you were.

11:45.356 --> 11:48.359
She hated Scarlett because
she wanted to be chair

11:48.446 --> 11:50.622
and Scarlett whipped her
butt in the election.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.102
'Schooled her, right, Mandy?'

11:52.189 --> 11:54.191
Oh, I'm not getting
into this one.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.325
Right, I missed out on
scoring the private office

11:57.412 --> 12:00.502
with all that cool stationery
with my name on it.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.460
So I killed her.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.549
Have you any idea
how idiotic you sound?

12:04.636 --> 12:05.855
You're the idiot.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.509
Tell you what,
it's probably best

12:07.596 --> 12:08.945
if we conduct interviews
with each of you separately.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.730
'You're always so jealous
of everybody.'

12:13.210 --> 12:14.472
Do you remember
anything odd

12:14.559 --> 12:16.736
happening the night
of the party?

12:16.823 --> 12:21.741
I don't know, it was just the
usual mojitos and chitchat but..

12:21.828 --> 12:23.133
But what?

12:23.220 --> 12:25.092
I don't know if I should
tell you this, but I..

12:25.179 --> 12:28.138
...I saw Scarlett arguing
with Asra Hadami.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.923
'Looked kind of angry.'

12:30.010 --> 12:32.316
Some say something more than
business might be going on

12:32.403 --> 12:34.275
between Asra Hadami
and Victor Marquesa.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.798
I don't know if that's true

12:35.885 --> 12:37.844
and I don't really
follow the gossip.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.976
Hmm. Who does?

12:40.063 --> 12:43.240
'We're told you're
the gossip queen around here.'

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
People tell me things.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.551
So..

12:49.638 --> 12:52.467
Who's having an affair
with Victor Marquesa?

12:52.554 --> 12:56.123
- I don't know. Who? Tell.
- Asra Hadami?

12:56.210 --> 12:59.039
[laughing]

12:59.126 --> 13:00.475
'That's a funny idea?'

13:00.562 --> 13:03.086
No, it's just...no.

13:03.173 --> 13:06.829
Victor and Asra
are good friends, nothing more.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.483
Asra had nothing
to do with this.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.921
No? What's the general
opinion, who did this?

13:13.053 --> 13:14.532
- My guess?
- Yeah.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.666
- Victor.
- What makes you think that?

13:17.753 --> 13:20.016
Nothing, really..
Victor's a nice guy

13:20.103 --> 13:21.975
but that's who kills
women, isn't it?

13:22.062 --> 13:24.325
Their husbands
90% of the time.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.545
- 70%, I think.
- Hmm.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.851
He's right.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.206
[audience applauding]

13:44.171 --> 13:45.999
That was some great play.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.436
You could maybe do a little
more topspin on your returns

13:48.523 --> 13:50.133
but it was a very nice play.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.135
The answers are
yes, I disliked her.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.747
- No, I didn't kill her.
- You hate to lose, don't you?

13:55.835 --> 14:00.404
Yes, unlike all those
many people that love it.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.189
I'm in the semifinals,
for God sake.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.844
Oh, of course.
Good luck with that.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.323
Yeah, I have to go.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.890
'I've another match
in half an hour'

14:07.977 --> 14:09.979
and that toxic dwarf
Mandy Riljek

14:10.066 --> 14:12.068
is trying to outbid me
in the silent auction.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.897
What she needs two romantic
nights for at the Cliffside?

14:14.984 --> 14:18.074
I don't know.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.207
So I'll save us all some time

14:20.294 --> 14:22.122
and tell you who did this
if you like.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.472
I'd like that very much.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.954
- Asra Hadami.
- Really? Why?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.913
She's having
an affair with Victor.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.219
How do you know that?

14:32.306 --> 14:34.264
I just have an eye
for that stuff.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.049
Asra must have killed
Scarlett so that

14:36.136 --> 14:38.007
she could have Victor
for herself.

14:38.094 --> 14:41.358
'Don't know why.
If you ask me, he's a loser.'

14:41.445 --> 14:43.230
Well, thank you.
Oh, by the way

14:43.317 --> 14:45.275
if you disliked
Scarlett Marquesa so much

14:45.362 --> 14:47.277
why are you wearing
earrings that she made?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.627
She makes good earrings.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.629
It's nice to meet you.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.071
Nice meeting you too.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.813
[Rigsby]
'You two were close,
weren't you?'

15:01.901 --> 15:03.685
[Jackie]
'We were very close.'

15:03.772 --> 15:06.470
Being her deputy in the women's
committee, we spoke every day.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.211
Uh, did you notice
anything, uh..

15:08.298 --> 15:10.518
...different about, uh,
your conversations?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.476
[Jackie]
'She talked a lot
about moving away.'

15:12.563 --> 15:15.001
She was so tired of keeping
up at all costs.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.916
At all costs?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.875
- Just working so hard.
- Do you have a key for this?

15:19.962 --> 15:22.660
Oh, no, only Scarlett
has a key.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
This is the
chairwoman's office

15:24.271 --> 15:26.926
and that's the
chairwoman's safe.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.884
That makes sense.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.625
I don't know anything
about that.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.105
Scarlett's keys
are missing.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.063
That's interesting.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.285
[Patrick]
'We need to get
that safe opened.'

15:38.372 --> 15:39.634
We're gonna need
a search warrant for that.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.070
I'm on it.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.637
Did you get anything
from Scarlett's friends?

15:42.724 --> 15:44.465
Well, everybody has
a different theory.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.424
They're all hiding something.
I don't know what.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.686
Did you hear anything
from forensics

15:48.773 --> 15:50.297
about the lipstick
on the napkin?

15:50.384 --> 15:52.734
Not yet. They're jammed up
as usual. Budget cuts.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.303
Boss, I just now got access
to Asra Hadami's financials.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.000
She cleared out her bank
accounts this morning.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.177
Checking, savings took out
about $125,000 in cash.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.136
Going on the run maybe?

16:03.223 --> 16:05.921
She didn't happen to buy any
rat poison recently, did she?

16:06.008 --> 16:08.619
That would be nice, but no.
No record of it.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.578
That was the Marsante
security patrol calling.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.623
They just found Hadami's
house empty. She's gone.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.103
Great. A fugitive.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.627
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I-I know where she is.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.075
CBI!

16:29.162 --> 16:30.467
'Uh..'

16:41.826 --> 16:43.219
- 'Boss?'
- 'Hmm.'

16:43.306 --> 16:45.613
I've been here nearly
six months now, half a year.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.397
What do you want,
half a cake?

16:47.484 --> 16:49.356
I wanna take lead
on this interview.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.405
Okay.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.624
Okay?

16:56.711 --> 16:58.278
Yeah. Sure.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.757
Thanks, boss.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.547
'Why were you running,
Miss Hadami?'

17:06.634 --> 17:09.767
No reason.
Stress, I needed space.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.247
Nothing to do with
the argument you had

17:11.334 --> 17:12.944
with Scarlett Marquesa
the night she died?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.729
I didn't have an
argument with her.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.426
We hear differently.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.254
'No argument.'

17:18.341 --> 17:21.214
I swear I didn't kill
her, this is absurd.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.954
No more absurd than you
clearing out your accounts

17:23.042 --> 17:25.261
and abandoning your
home for no reason.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.915
Maybe I need a lawyer.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.269
Say the word,
what he'll tell you

17:33.356 --> 17:34.705
if you're not involved
in the murder..

17:37.621 --> 17:39.797
Best speak up.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.670
I ran because I knew the murder
would expose some issues

17:42.757 --> 17:44.193
that I would like
to keep private.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.717
Such as your relationship
with Mandy Riljek?

17:46.804 --> 17:49.285
Exactly. News like that
could be ruinous.

17:49.372 --> 17:53.420
True, but not the kind of thing
you abandon your house for.

17:53.507 --> 17:57.902
You said issues.
What are the other issues?

17:57.989 --> 18:00.340
I didn't wanna have to look
Victor in the face

18:00.427 --> 18:02.298
and tell him I'd helped
run everything he'd worked

18:02.385 --> 18:04.083
so hard for into the ground.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.997
How did you help do that?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.435
I borrowed money from the
company's cash reserve.

18:08.522 --> 18:09.784
'How much?'

18:09.871 --> 18:12.221
A little over
half a million.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.528
Where did it go?

18:14.615 --> 18:16.182
I made some poor
investment choices

18:16.269 --> 18:17.966
that I had to cover
quickly.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.969
- So you stole--
- I borrowedfrom the reserve.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.319
I skimmed the money from each
development deal which should

18:23.406 --> 18:26.540
have gone into the company's
reserve account as backup.

18:26.627 --> 18:27.976
'We were making so many deals.'

18:28.063 --> 18:30.761
I knew I'd get it back
before it would matter.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.589
But then the deals
and the funding dried up

18:32.676 --> 18:36.941
and suddenly that reserve
became very important.

18:37.028 --> 18:40.206
I sold anything I could get
my hands on to cover the money.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.914
Hmm. Take a seat.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.699
Why am I even here?
I've done nothing wrong.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.528
'I'll be with you in
just one moment.'

19:02.184 --> 19:03.620
Please.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.105
Well, you were found in
a compromising position

19:10.192 --> 19:12.238
with a murder suspect.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.197
How did you know how to find us
anyway, you been spying on me?

19:15.284 --> 19:17.634
Well, you outbid Patience
for a romantic weekend

19:17.721 --> 19:19.636
and your husband Jim's away.

19:19.723 --> 19:23.814
And you laughed at the idea
of Victor and Asra as lovers.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.468
Nobody knows I'm here, right?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.296
If this gets out,
it'll be a huge scandal.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.689
Nobody knows you're here.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.431
Sign this,
and you're good to go.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.959
[Kimball]
'Judge's clerk says we
won't get a search warrant'

19:38.046 --> 19:39.482
for Scarlett's safe
until tomorrow morning.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.050
Then we'll go in
and tear the place apart.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.704
Oh. Sorry.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.055
You didn't hear that.
It's confidential.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.318
Confidential?
Oh, of course.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.016
No, seriously.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

19:52.103 --> 19:54.193
I understand.
May I leave now?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.890
Yeah, please.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.897
Not bad, your delivery
was a bit wooden.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.768
Wooden, me?

20:04.855 --> 20:06.422
Yeah, and you're
Marlon Brando.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.297
I can't believe it.

20:11.384 --> 20:14.517
Asra's been with me
for over five years.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.346
'I mean, she was with
me in the trenches.'

20:17.433 --> 20:19.174
I can't believe this.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.916
After going over your accounts,
we had a couple of questions.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.439
Sure.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.615
You've talked about cash
crisis in your business

20:25.702 --> 20:28.488
but regular cash deposits were
made to your personal accounts

20:28.575 --> 20:30.185
somewhere upwards of $5,000.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.667
Scarlett's deposits.
Oscar, come get your lunch.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.756
Those are some pretty hefty
deposits for somebody

20:35.843 --> 20:38.541
not really working,
where'd the money come from?

20:38.628 --> 20:40.935
Uh, her jewelry business.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.893
I thought you said it was
a small side business.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.331
Oh, it was, but recently
her pieces were

20:45.418 --> 20:48.595
'getting a lot of interest
and apparently, uh..'

20:48.682 --> 20:50.597
...she made a deal with
a couple of boutiques.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.121
- Do you know which ones?
- I never asked.

20:53.208 --> 20:56.124
[Grace]
'Without her money, you would
have fallen behind months ago.'

20:56.211 --> 20:57.908
I know all too well
it was my wife

20:57.995 --> 20:59.910
who had to save
our butts recently.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.913
- 'Dad?'
- What's the matter?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.915
You made it wrong.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.396
Mommy never puts all
this stuff in it.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.963
She knows I like
it plain.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.660
Can we make
a compromise, buddy?

21:10.747 --> 21:13.489
I-I need to talk to these
nice police ladies.

21:13.576 --> 21:16.318
Now I'll make it better
next time, I promise.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.668
Now would you please just
eat the sandwich?

21:20.757 --> 21:22.933
- 'Sorry about that.'
- It's not a problem.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.457
According to your
wife's phone records

21:24.544 --> 21:26.241
she traded a lot
of calls with

21:26.328 --> 21:28.287
several disposable
cellphones.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.071
Well, I don't know who she
would have been talking to.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.378
In her day planner,
she had a regular weekly

21:32.465 --> 21:35.206
date noted down with
an address in Marysville.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.295
She had one scheduled
for later today.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.861
Do you know anything
about that?

21:37.948 --> 21:39.167
No, I don't know what
that's about but I know

21:39.254 --> 21:40.647
she used to go
to Marysville a lot

21:40.734 --> 21:42.866
for the antique jewelry
markets and stuff.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.259
[cellphone ringing]

21:44.346 --> 21:45.913
Excuse me.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.962
- Lisbon.
- 'Results on the lipstick.'

21:52.049 --> 21:53.529
No traces of DNA were found

21:53.616 --> 21:55.314
but the color
Tongue In Cheek

21:55.401 --> 21:57.925
is a limited edition, sold only
in a few high-end stores.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.057
Tongue In Cheek,
that's cute.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.451
Look, secure access to each
of the stores receipt records

22:02.538 --> 22:04.279
'so we can search
through them.'

22:04.366 --> 22:09.371
'Then I want you to meet us
at 6-5-4-3-4 East Boulevard.'

22:09.458 --> 22:11.330
- 'It's in Marysville.'
- On my way.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.512
[applause]

22:21.252 --> 22:23.037
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.301
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.651
- Who's winning?
- 'Oh, I don't know.'

22:28.738 --> 22:30.610
I don't follow
the play to be honest.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.916
That's kinda silly, isn't it?

22:33.003 --> 22:35.049
Everybody's so serious
over a game.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.791
Exactly. Like it matters
who wins a stupid trophy.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.359
I guess people feel
they need a purpose.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.927
Yeah, well, my purpose died
this year at the age of 16.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.452
Oh. I'm sorry.
Boy or girl?

22:46.539 --> 22:49.019
Girl. High as a kite
with one of her friends.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.413
She wrapped her car
around a tree.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.894
Friend got away without
a scratch, thank God.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.244
- What was her name?
- Rachel.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.683
Once you lose a child,
all this striving seems

23:00.770 --> 23:02.206
kinda ridiculous, you know?

23:02.293 --> 23:03.817
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.

23:06.297 --> 23:09.736
Why not leave it all
behind, just go away?

23:09.823 --> 23:11.520
I can't afford to leave.

23:11.607 --> 23:14.741
I have negative
equity on my house.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.264
Oh, nice play, Karen.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.399
Besides, these are my friends.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.617
This is all I have.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.241
[indistinct chattering]

23:37.328 --> 23:38.808
So much for jewelry.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.115
According to Scarlett's
planner, the meeting's here.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.117
Let's see if we can
spot the contact.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.727
I don't know,
maybe we'll get lucky.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.253
[indistinct chattering]

23:55.912 --> 23:57.653
[instrumental music]

23:59.525 --> 24:01.440
Hi, guys.
What are you doing?

24:01.527 --> 24:02.528
Nothin'.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.529
Hey!

24:08.098 --> 24:09.491
What the hell
are you doing, man?

24:09.578 --> 24:10.884
Put your hands
behind your back.

24:14.801 --> 24:15.932
Let's go. Get up, get up.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.196
- This way.
- Alright, alright.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.859
I should have
brought some snacks.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.905
I don't see this
working in a hurry.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.733
'Ah, you shouldn't
go hungry long.'

24:33.820 --> 24:36.779
Mandy's news will
have spread quickly.

24:36.866 --> 24:42.045
Everyone knows that tomorrow
the safe will be opened.

24:42.132 --> 24:45.309
It's now or never for whoever
took Scarlett's keys.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.359
[engine revving]

24:51.446 --> 24:52.665
Hey, easy there.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.884
That is antique
Mexican silver.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.451
Maybe next time
you'll think before

24:56.538 --> 24:59.019
trying to outrun
an officer of the law.

24:59.106 --> 25:02.239
I'm assuming
this isn't candy.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.720
Why were you meeting
Scarlett Marquesa?

25:04.807 --> 25:07.070
So we could exchange
beauty secrets.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.898
- You mind if I smoke?
- Yeah, I do.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.510
- Oh.
- Van Pelt, what do you got?

25:11.597 --> 25:14.208
Wardell Suggs, AKA Digger.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.689
'He's been arrested for several
counts of petty theft'

25:16.776 --> 25:18.342
fraud and assault.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.040
That's very impressive.

25:20.127 --> 25:23.434
- It could be better.
- Why were you meeting Scarlett?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.133
- What'd she tell you about me?
- Nothing. She's dead.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.876
I-I didn't have anything
to do with that.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.532
Hey, boss, come take a look.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.188
Would you look at that?
The mother lode.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.060
Let's talk, huh?

25:40.147 --> 25:42.062
The hell, I got
a strike to give.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.151
Scarlett was one
of my biggest customers.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.022
Painkillers, tranquilizers

25:46.109 --> 25:49.286
diet pills, by the hundreds.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.811
Scarlett was dealing
prescription drugs?

25:51.898 --> 25:53.464
Yep.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.163
- Where did you two meet?
- Swap meet.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.209
She was trying to sell
that God-awful jewelry.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.515
She looked desperate,
so I told her

26:00.602 --> 26:02.212
there's easier ways
to make money.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.823
Were you doing
a deal tonight?

26:03.910 --> 26:06.042
Supposed to. Lately, I've
been having to listen

26:06.129 --> 26:08.262
to her yammer about quitting.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.394
Then she'd buy some bag,
saying this is the last time

26:10.481 --> 26:12.875
she's doing it, of course
she'd always come back.

26:12.962 --> 26:15.617
- She was gonna quit?
- Yep.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.967
A matter of fact, last
couple of weeks

26:18.054 --> 26:19.447
I've been getting a call
from another girl

26:19.534 --> 26:21.362
says Scarlett gave
her my info.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.017
Same prissy kind of voice.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.497
Chick said she wanted to set
up her own situation

26:26.585 --> 26:28.195
when Scarlett quit.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.197
Does this chickhave a name?

26:30.284 --> 26:32.155
You know, I'm not big
on names at first

26:32.242 --> 26:33.896
but I do have her number.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.945
Why don't you
give her a call?

26:40.860 --> 26:43.166
[dramatic music]

26:54.438 --> 26:55.962
[cellphone ringing]

26:56.049 --> 26:57.398
Oh.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.228
Digger, why are you
calling me now?

27:04.274 --> 27:06.015
[sighs]

27:16.025 --> 27:17.418
[chuckles]

27:18.767 --> 27:20.421
Uh.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.337
In your own time, ma'am,
if you'd like to take a seat.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.386
- Thank you so much, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

27:31.562 --> 27:34.087
How did you come to have
Scarlett Marquesa's keys?

27:34.174 --> 27:37.699
I took them when I went to offer
my condolences to Victor.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.658
Naughty I know,
but I couldn't wait.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.530
It's not naughty.
It's a felony.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.663
You wanted to get your hands
on her pill supply.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.099
Nonsense.

27:46.186 --> 27:49.189
I opened that safe
out of idle curiosity.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.452
'I had no idea there were
any pills in there.'

27:51.539 --> 27:53.976
I simply wanted to measure
the windows for new drapes.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.543
I'll be the next chair
of the committee.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.459
Oh. Then why not wait
till it's official?

27:58.546 --> 28:01.549
Am I here because of keys?

28:01.636 --> 28:04.944
Explain the nature of your
relationship with Wardell Suggs.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.423
Who?

28:06.510 --> 28:07.511
Digger?

28:09.600 --> 28:10.863
I liked his jewelry.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.691
Okay.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.997
Were you aware that Scarlett
Marquesa was selling illegal

28:15.084 --> 28:17.086
prescription drugs in
the Villa Marsante Estates?

28:17.173 --> 28:18.958
Whodidn'tknow?

28:19.045 --> 28:21.525
Well, except for you all.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.356
If everyone knew, then why
didn't anyone come forth?

28:26.443 --> 28:28.054
And risked being ostracized

28:28.141 --> 28:31.840
or caught up in the vulgarity
of it all, not likely.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.363
She was doing
a booming business

28:33.450 --> 28:34.930
and I think you wanted
to be part of it.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.366
Maybe a little too much.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.717
So I killed her? Please.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.893
Hello. She was a drug dealer.

28:40.980 --> 28:44.679
People she dealt with must have
done her in...other dealers.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.289
Or a highly capable rival

28:46.376 --> 28:48.422
straight in the middle
of her own community?

28:48.509 --> 28:52.208
You have found no drugs,
or poison on me, or in my home.

28:52.295 --> 28:55.255
The keys were taken
aftershe was killed

28:55.342 --> 28:58.040
and I only opened that safe
out of idle curiosity.

28:58.127 --> 29:01.043
You taped together your
whole theory with a couple

29:01.130 --> 29:04.394
of random conversations
I've had with a drug dealer.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.179
Does that about sum it up?

29:06.266 --> 29:08.485
Uh, when she puts it like that,
it does seem pretty thin.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.444
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.185
- Isn't she?
- Yeah.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.926
We're gonna have to cut her
loose for now, but I think

29:14.013 --> 29:16.102
some discreet surveillance
might help our cause.

29:21.063 --> 29:24.327
If you were thinking of trying
that on, don't, not your shade.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.852
What do you think
about older women?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.723
Where is this coming from?
I don't think about older women.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.029
My mother's an older woman.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.248
Not old old,
just older, you know?

29:32.335 --> 29:33.423
Older than you.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.730
Why you asking?

29:35.817 --> 29:38.211
You're not trying to set me
up with somebody, are you?

29:38.298 --> 29:39.560
It turns out if you
look at the available

29:39.647 --> 29:41.214
scientific evidence
on the internet

29:41.301 --> 29:42.650
and they've got
less hang-ups

29:42.737 --> 29:44.217
they like themselves way
more than younger women

29:44.304 --> 29:46.175
and they're at
their sexual peak.

29:46.262 --> 29:49.048
I mean that's what
the research says anyhow.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.789
What the hell happened to you
at that country club?

29:53.530 --> 29:55.750
Nothing. I'm just saying
that.. Oh, no, she spotted us.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.277
Afternoon, boys.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.018
I was making
myself a Panini

30:03.105 --> 30:04.890
and thought
I'd bring you some too.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.326
Oh. Thanks, ma'am.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.849
Oh, and just so you know

30:07.936 --> 30:09.546
I am headed
to the club for a massage.

30:09.633 --> 30:12.158
So, you don't need
to follow too close.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.029
Relax.
Have a bite to eat first.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.074
I'll see you there.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.162
Yes, ma'am.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.646
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.
What is wrong with you?

30:22.733 --> 30:24.735
- Well, she surprised me.
- What's in the sandwiches?

30:24.823 --> 30:28.000
It's a Panini,
if you don't mind.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.828
It's, uh, ham and cheese.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.046
Yeah, who knows what else?

30:36.269 --> 30:38.880
My God!

30:40.316 --> 30:42.666
Drugs?

30:42.753 --> 30:44.886
I can't believe it.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.627
Using jewelry
sales as a cover

30:46.714 --> 30:48.716
your wife was dealing
prescription drugs.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.022
'Painkillers mostly.'

30:50.109 --> 30:52.372
'Speed, diet pills.'

30:52.459 --> 30:54.113
Some of them were
coming in from Mexico.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.897
Other ones were stolen
from pharmacies.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.945
You seem
genuinely surprised.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.772
A lot of people around
here knew about her.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.991
I had no idea.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.517
You don't think I had
something to do with this?

31:07.604 --> 31:09.606
She was moving
an awful lot of inventory.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.392
I had nothing
to do with this.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.610
How could you
have not known

31:13.697 --> 31:14.916
she was medicating
half the women

31:15.003 --> 31:16.091
'in the neighborhood?'

31:16.178 --> 31:17.527
She lied to me.

31:22.228 --> 31:25.144
Maybe she was just trying
to protect me from the shame.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.929
Or maybe, it was easier
just to turn a blind eye

31:28.016 --> 31:29.365
as long as
the money was coming in.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.845
[Victor]
'No.'

31:30.932 --> 31:32.891
'If I had known
she was doing this..'

31:37.504 --> 31:39.114
Hi. I'm Patrick.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.246
Oscar.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.769
You wanna talk, Oscar?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.515
[sighs]

31:51.300 --> 31:52.562
[clears throat]

31:58.786 --> 32:00.614
Pretty heavy stuff
going on, right?

32:00.701 --> 32:01.876
Yeah.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.967
I'm sorry about your mom.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.099
Me too.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.840
My dad is sad
because you guys

32:09.928 --> 32:12.582
can't find who did it.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.498
But I don't mind about that.

32:15.585 --> 32:16.804
I just want her back.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.809
She can't come back.
You know that, don't you?

32:21.896 --> 32:23.289
I know that.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.987
I'm nine.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.468
I will never see her again
until I'm dead too.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.080
Then I'll go stay
with her in heaven.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.170
Well, that sounds good.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.650
But you know what I noticed
you're really good at

32:36.737 --> 32:38.652
that could
help you right now?

32:38.739 --> 32:41.263
What?

32:41.350 --> 32:43.787
Make-believe.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.789
Yeah. I am.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.575
You are very good at it.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.925
A master like you, you wanted
to talk to your mom you could

32:51.012 --> 32:52.753
make-believe she was here
and do whatever you like.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.842
- I do it all the time.
- You talk to my mom?

32:54.929 --> 32:58.106
No, not your mom.
I talk to my wife.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.674
- She's dead?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:00.761 --> 33:01.805
But I talk
to her all the time.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.330
You should try it.
It's very good.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.635
I guess.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.072
'Well, whatever.'

33:08.856 --> 33:11.554
This is cool.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.426
You any good
with this sword?

33:13.513 --> 33:16.255
I'm okay.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.300
Oh, really?

33:18.387 --> 33:19.432
En garde.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.522
Ah, I got you.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.393
[laughing]

33:24.480 --> 33:25.960
Ah!

33:26.047 --> 33:27.005
- Please.
- Ha-ha.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.223
Mercy.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.355
Mercy.

33:31.357 --> 33:32.488
Fair maiden.

33:32.575 --> 33:33.881
d'Artagnan,
I have to go.

33:33.968 --> 33:34.925
Goodbye.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.587
[Wayne]
'Uh, spa stuff
takes forever.'

33:44.674 --> 33:46.502
How long can
a massage be?

33:46.589 --> 33:48.678
Ah, they do all sorts of things
to you besides a massage.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.767
Facials, waxing, mud.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.117
How do you know so much?

33:52.204 --> 33:53.553
I bought
a certificate for my mom.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.558
Wayne! You're back again.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.125
How nice.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.648
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.911
Now, you know,
you must call me Jackie.

34:03.998 --> 34:06.044
And it's miss not missus.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.088
Divorced.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.960
Sorry...Jackie.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.614
He was a good man..

34:11.701 --> 34:13.747
...but weak, essentially.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.053
- He just couldn't see--
- Wait.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.402
What are you wearing
on your lips?

34:16.489 --> 34:17.751
- Excuse me?
- The color.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.057
Wha-what color is this?

34:19.144 --> 34:21.146
Tongue In Cheek.
You like it?

34:21.233 --> 34:22.582
Where did you get it?

34:22.669 --> 34:24.236
I bought it
at the boutique in town.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.367
How long have you
been wearing this shade?

34:25.454 --> 34:27.282
I just bought it today.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.806
I saw it on Patience Broadbent
at Scarlett's party.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.156
I just had to have it.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.766
It's a crazy price,
but what the heck?

34:32.853 --> 34:34.724
And you're positive
that it's Tongue In Cheek?

34:34.811 --> 34:36.248
I have it right here.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.510
And you definitely
saw Patience wearing it

34:37.597 --> 34:39.164
first at
Scarlett Marquesa's party?

34:39.251 --> 34:40.339
Is that a pickup line?

34:40.426 --> 34:43.298
[screaming]

34:52.699 --> 34:54.614
[dramatic music]

35:07.888 --> 35:09.107
[indistinct chattering]

35:13.023 --> 35:15.200
No detectable prints
on the knife.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.244
Surveillance tapes?

35:16.331 --> 35:17.506
The spa didn't
believe in them.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.508
Something to do
with disturbing the chi.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.294
I don't get it.
Why kill Patience? Why now?

35:22.381 --> 35:24.034
Perhaps it was part
of the plan all along.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.775
No, this was hasty.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.690
Patience became
the new target.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.866
Revenge for Scarlett's death?

35:29.953 --> 35:32.086
Victor was quick to anger.

35:32.173 --> 35:35.002
Rigsby, find out Victor
Marquesa's recent whereabouts.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.873
- Yes, boss.
- It could be someone else.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.440
The competition
wiping out the dealer

35:38.527 --> 35:42.140
and her heir apparent or..

35:42.227 --> 35:44.881
Or what?

35:44.968 --> 35:47.623
Victor does fit
nicely, doesn't he?

35:47.710 --> 35:48.885
Yeah.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.807
Can you believe
that Patience got stabbed?

35:57.894 --> 35:59.200
- Here we are.
- It's like a mafia hit.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.941
I'm never going
in that spa again.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.856
I will tell you that.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.771
Tragic set of events.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.208
I didn't see it coming.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.906
So what do you think?
This is some kind of drug war?

36:09.993 --> 36:11.517
Could be.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.910
But stabbings are
usually crimes of passion.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.869
This is, uh,
this is very personal.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.218
Hmm.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.785
So what's next?

36:18.872 --> 36:21.831
CBI are already
putting the pieces together.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.790
In fact, uh..

36:24.965 --> 36:26.749
- Never mind.
- What?

36:26.836 --> 36:28.621
No, I-I.. I shouldn't
talk about it

36:28.708 --> 36:30.275
'cause it's still
an ongoing case.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.711
You know, you can't just leave
something like that hanging.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.103
Well, I'm sorry, you know

36:33.191 --> 36:34.670
I will get myself
in a lotta trouble.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.718
Oh, come on, girls.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.983
Alright, listen,
can you promise me

36:43.070 --> 36:44.071
that this will
just stay between us?

36:44.158 --> 36:45.246
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.639
- You promise?
- 'I promise.'

36:46.726 --> 36:48.858
Okay, we're going
after Victor Marquesa.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.730
Victor? Oh, I don't believe it.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.122
He doesn't even
look like the type.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.559
'On what grounds?'

36:53.646 --> 36:55.038
We think that
he killed Patience out of

36:55.125 --> 36:56.736
revenge for
the murder of his wife.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.041
But you said
there was no proof

36:58.128 --> 36:59.391
Patience was guilty.

36:59.478 --> 37:00.696
I guess Victor didn't wanna

37:00.783 --> 37:02.176
wait around for proof.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.830
What's gonna happen to Oscar?

37:03.917 --> 37:06.528
Mother murdered,
now dad's a murderer.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.791
Once they arrest the father,
he'll be placed in foster care.

37:08.878 --> 37:09.836
Oh, dreadful.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.621
That poor child.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.232
It is.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.450
Hmm.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.196
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:24.590 --> 37:27.070
I guess they couldn't
keep the secret.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.202
[Teresa]
'Guess they can't.'

37:30.073 --> 37:31.640
Let's do it.

37:33.381 --> 37:34.861
- 'It's gonna be alright, son.'
- 'Dad!'

37:34.948 --> 37:36.428
- I promise.
- 'No!'

37:36.515 --> 37:37.472
It's gonna be okay.

37:37.559 --> 37:38.778
Where are you going?

37:38.865 --> 37:39.822
'Don't worry!
I'll be right back!'

37:39.909 --> 37:41.607
No! Dad!

37:43.478 --> 37:46.829
- It's okay.
- 'Come back! No!'

37:46.916 --> 37:50.398
- 'No! Dad!'
- Stop, stop, stop.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.444
- You have to stop this.
- No. No, we can't.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.707
- This is justice being served.
- How can you say that?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.143
Look what you're
putting that boy through.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.884
He'll forget eventually.
It's fine.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.059
- No, he won't.
- It's fine.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.060
- No. No, it's not.
- Why?

38:00.147 --> 38:01.627
Because I did it!

38:01.714 --> 38:02.932
I killed them.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.979
I killed them both.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.155
Oh, God!

38:09.591 --> 38:10.723
[crying]

38:21.299 --> 38:22.561
I first suspected
it was you

38:22.648 --> 38:24.127
because it seemed
that everybody else

38:24.214 --> 38:26.826
at the club wore some
of Scarlett's jewelry.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.958
But not you.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.699
That's it?

38:30.786 --> 38:31.874
Jewelry?

38:31.961 --> 38:33.093
The more
we talked the more

38:33.180 --> 38:35.791
I felt your pain and anger.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.492
Losing your daughter
has unhinged you.

38:40.579 --> 38:41.710
Unhinged?

38:43.886 --> 38:46.933
Yeah, I suppose it has.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.373
My daughter..

38:52.460 --> 38:53.592
[sniffles]

38:55.158 --> 38:56.421
...Rachel.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.729
'She loved to dance.'

39:00.816 --> 39:02.514
'It didn't matter
what kind of music either'

39:02.601 --> 39:06.300
her toe would
start tapping and..

39:06.387 --> 39:10.043
...she was just
so full of life.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.352
She had taken several
painkillers with alcohol

39:14.439 --> 39:17.790
before she got
behind the wheel.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.227
One of her neighborhood
friends got them from her mother

39:20.314 --> 39:22.490
who got them from Scarlett.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.492
I understand your anger.

39:24.579 --> 39:28.366
It was like they ripped
my soul out clean.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.629
But the rest
of the world just kept..

39:30.716 --> 39:33.196
...moving right along.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.415
It was like
I was the only one

39:34.502 --> 39:35.590
who remembered
what happened.

39:37.984 --> 39:38.985
So when I..

39:39.072 --> 39:40.508
...saw her..

39:40.595 --> 39:42.380
...flitting about town

39:42.467 --> 39:45.470
selling her pills
without a care in the world

39:45.557 --> 39:48.560
still hosting
parties at her house

39:48.647 --> 39:51.214
happily dancing around
without a stitch of the misery

39:51.301 --> 39:54.392
I was carrying, I snapped.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.003
[indistinct chattering]

39:57.090 --> 39:58.221
I killed her.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.406
I didn't want
any other person

40:08.493 --> 40:10.190
to have to experience
what I did.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.244
[coughing]

40:27.686 --> 40:29.644
And Patience?

40:29.731 --> 40:32.604
She told everyone
at the club not to worry.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.388
She was gonna take over
Scarlett's business

40:34.475 --> 40:35.781
and keep the pills coming.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.741
Like nothing had happened.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.351
Like no lessons
had been learned.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.225
I had to finish
what I started.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.272
I had to.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.931
I'll get this transcribed
for you to sign.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.680
Now that it's done,
does it feel better?

41:10.685 --> 41:12.252
It doesn't change a thing.

41:23.742 --> 41:24.917
Agent Lisbon?

41:25.004 --> 41:27.441
Mr. Marquesa, hi.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.009
I want to thank you
and your team.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.271
Although, I must admit

41:31.358 --> 41:32.315
that whole scene
in front of the house--

41:32.402 --> 41:34.230
It was make-believe, dad.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.450
Sorry, the make-believe was

41:36.537 --> 41:39.366
a bit unorthodox
and unpleasant

41:39.453 --> 41:41.934
but I'm sure you all
know what you're doing.

41:42.021 --> 41:44.110
Most of the time.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.591
I want to apologize
if we were tough on you.

41:46.678 --> 41:49.942
No, it's what I needed to hear.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.552
We're moving out
of Villa Marsante

41:51.639 --> 41:55.034
and, uh, headed
back to my hometown.

41:55.121 --> 41:58.820
My son and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

42:00.866 --> 42:02.128
Take care.

42:02.215 --> 42:03.259
Thanks.

42:05.392 --> 42:06.785
Mr. Jane.

42:08.787 --> 42:10.005
Thank you.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.747
Oh, it's nothing.
Forget about it.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.053
Take care.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.882
Good luck. Bye.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.625
Another minute,
and I would have missed 'em.

42:20.712 --> 42:21.887
I do hate it
when people say thank you.

42:21.974 --> 42:23.018
Why?

42:23.105 --> 42:24.803
He likes to play
the lone ranger.

42:24.890 --> 42:26.456
Who was
that masked man?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.023
'I never got
a chance to thank him.'

42:31.070 --> 42:32.332
Exactly.

42:34.987 --> 42:37.119
Uh, I don't
want to alarm you

42:37.206 --> 42:40.340
but your friend Jackie
has just walked in behind you

42:40.427 --> 42:43.169
and she is looking fierce.

42:43.256 --> 42:44.692
Oh, I know.

42:44.779 --> 42:45.780
I asked her out to dinner.

42:48.696 --> 42:49.610
Hey.

42:51.525 --> 42:53.571
[instrumental music]

43:13.547 --> 43:15.723
[Patrick]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
