WEBVTT

00:32.407 --> 00:33.950
-Yup.
Yup.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.618
-

00:35.702 --> 00:36.536
Yup.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.749
-Dale, what the heck are you...
Oh, I see you've noticed the land canoe.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.418
It's an old motorcycle sidecar I found,

00:43.501 --> 00:46.379
now cunningly stabilized
with a bicycle wheel

00:46.463 --> 00:48.631
and propelled by this golf club.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.719
-Dale, that is the stupidest goddang--
I want to ride in the land canoe!

00:52.802 --> 00:55.472
Sorry, Bill. This is a one-man land canoe.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.556
Away!

00:56.681 --> 00:59.392
-

00:59.476 --> 01:02.520
Huh. It goes faster than I expected.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.481


01:04.564 --> 01:07.025
I love how they spell words
in <i>The Economist.</i>

01:07.108 --> 01:09.402
It's like you can see
the classy British accent.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.946
-Hank, I can't stop! I can't... Aah!

01:12.280 --> 01:14.616
Ay-ya! My roses!

01:14.699 --> 01:17.035
-

01:17.118 --> 01:19.162
Stupid hillbillies!

01:19.245 --> 01:22.707
If we were members of Nine Rivers
Country Club, we could escape this!

01:22.791 --> 01:26.836
But Nine Rivers got that four-strikes-
you're-out application policy.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.755
And we on our last strike.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.049
We need to wait
for our perfect opportunity.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.926
-Bobby, listen!

01:33.009 --> 01:36.096
Lucky can make his truck engine
play <i>Green Acres.</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.813
I'm in. We do whatever it takes.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.819
Oh, look at our little garbage boy.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.279
He is growing into a garbage man.

01:53.363 --> 01:57.075
Completing a scheduled chore
in a timely fashion.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.536
Wait. Why is he leaving the bags
on the curb?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.538
Into the cans, Bobby.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.373
Step three, like we talked about.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.416
Step three!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.128
I'm going out there.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.131
It was already full.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.342
Is this even our garbage?

02:14.425 --> 02:17.011
It smells too old to be ours.

02:17.095 --> 02:21.683
We don't use canned milk
or drink Old Grand-Dad.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.977
It is someone else's! Good Lord!

02:25.478 --> 02:28.106
I feel so... violated.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.693
A stranger from another block
used my cans.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.737
Well, what makes you so sure the guy
isn't from our block?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.031
He threw away a car battery.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.910
I do not live on the same block
with animals.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.953
Thank you, Hank.

02:42.787 --> 02:46.833
Our key to success is to excel
at something that Nine Rivers needs.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.168
They the best.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.628
And they will take you if you're the best.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.839
What are we the best at?

02:57.844 --> 03:01.723
<i>Discover a hidden realm of luxury.</i>

03:01.806 --> 03:04.100
A realm of luxury.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.729
<i>We offer many activities</i>

03:07.812 --> 03:12.567
<i>where excellence</i><i>is</i><i>encouraged</i>
<i>or</i><i>in</i><i>most</i><i>cases,</i><i>required.</i>

03:12.650 --> 03:14.861
<i>Archery, calligraphy...</i>

03:14.944 --> 03:17.405
-Kahn, how's your calligraphy?
-Unexceptional.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.660
<i>...polo, competitive skeet-shooting</i>
<i>team,</i><i>and new media labs.</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:24.787
Hey, that's it. Skeet shooting!

03:24.871 --> 03:26.956
Back in Laos, you were an excellent shot!

03:27.040 --> 03:30.919
I was young, beautiful girl
with lots of rage back then.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.297
Wait, I still filled with rage,
and I still pretty hot.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.256
Get me a gun!

03:38.426 --> 03:41.512
Our skeet team made the Troy Club Classic
this year.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.474
And we are thrilled to bits.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.017
Frankly, our scruffy little gang

03:46.100 --> 03:48.561
might even beat the high
and mighty Pennington Oaks.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.438
Wouldn't that be a thing?

03:50.521 --> 03:51.731
That's why I'm here!

03:52.148 --> 03:55.068
Name a target. I guarantee I nail it!

03:55.151 --> 03:56.569
Uh, Minh,

03:57.028 --> 04:00.114
skeet involves shotguns
and moving targets.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.201
But if you do master the sport, call me.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.453
Or maybe texting would be better.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.625
Stupid real estate development.

04:10.708 --> 04:15.755
That's the third gun range I've called
that's closed to make room for new condos.

04:15.838 --> 04:16.673
Wait!

04:16.756 --> 04:18.633
Dale Gribble got a private gun club,
remember?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.010
Shoot with Gribble? You nuts?

04:21.094 --> 04:25.056
We trying to escape hillbillies,
not climb into bunk bed with them.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.141
Minh, I want to show you something.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.564
They call this sport whifflebeer.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.653
I got it!

04:38.736 --> 04:39.737
Mine, mine, mine!

04:42.949 --> 04:44.033
Mm.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.581
To escape from rednecks,
I join their club.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.422
Here, neighbor.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.173
Let me help you.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.806
Minh, I can't believe
you wanted to join our gun club.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.600
See, I always thought you hated me.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.811
Don't be a silly goose.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.646
Why would you think I hated you?

05:13.730 --> 05:17.275
Well, you always talk about
how you hate my son,

05:17.358 --> 05:21.195
and how you hate my friends,
how much you hate me.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.073
Aah. Cultural misunderstanding.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.911
Hey,

05:28.995 --> 05:31.581
this place takes me back
to the days of shooting

05:31.664 --> 05:35.877
with my dad's original non-modified AK-47.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.296
You shot an old-school AK?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.049
Put her there. I'm Fitzi. This is Moose.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.345
Wait. Excuse me.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.226
Great to meet you!

05:52.310 --> 05:54.979
Guys call me Johnny Knucklehead
because I ain't too bright.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.690
Um...

05:57.774 --> 05:59.734
Okay, knucklehead.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.737
So...

06:03.321 --> 06:06.324
how about we shoot some guns?

06:06.407 --> 06:07.909
-That sounds good.
-Yeah, okay.

06:07.992 --> 06:08.993
I'm easy.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.292
-All right!
-Hoo-ee!

06:16.376 --> 06:18.294
-You see that?
-Wow.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.088
Minh is my neighbor.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.054
So, how your practice go? Did it go great?

06:28.137 --> 06:30.765
-Is your shooting improving?
-Shooting was fine.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.725
But the place a pigsty.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.560
They don't even have a skeet range.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.438
Those rednecks are just bears
with furniture.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.775
Hey, those bears are our ticket
to Nine Rivers.

06:40.858 --> 06:45.154
So smile and be nice to them.
We must be focused on our reward.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.534
Hello, Kahn and Minh.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.244
Hello, Ted and Cindy.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.663
Are you enjoying your membership here
at Nine Rivers?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.373
Oh, yes we are, Ted.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.332
Super.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.502
Ooh.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.004
You paint such a vivid picture!

07:04.882 --> 07:08.511
Minh, code name Madam X, as a new member,

07:08.594 --> 07:12.473
we have come to kidnap you
for your secret club initiation.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.976
Woo, woo, woo.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.477
No, thanks. Bye.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.439
Don't be ridiculous, Minh.
Go out with your great new friends.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.108
Live life. Have fun!

07:22.191 --> 07:23.776
Eat lots of mayonnaise!

07:24.569 --> 07:27.196
Now, Bobby, fitting two weeks'
worth of garbage

07:27.280 --> 07:30.867
into one week's cans takes
some clever bag positioning.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.994
But it's a valuable life skill.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.746
Goddangit!

07:35.830 --> 07:37.874
Dangit! Dangit!

07:37.957 --> 07:39.000
Who are you?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.293
Why me?

07:42.086 --> 07:44.213
Oh, Hank, not again.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.383
Dad, I saw a dumpster four blocks over.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.178
We could sneak over there
when it gets dark.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.681
No. I refuse to spread this disease.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.476
Tomorrow, I'm fixing padlocks on our cans.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.102
There's the man I married!

08:02.523 --> 08:07.028
Sergeant at Arms, perform your duty.

08:07.987 --> 08:14.076
Brother Minh, do you solemnly swear
to be loyal to your brother members?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.077
Um.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.120
Yes, I do.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.082
Now the secret password will be revealed.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.418
-Howl like a werewolf.
-What?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.505
Like that.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.548
Um.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.469
Come on. With feeling. Try again.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.017
Yeah!

08:42.688 --> 08:45.358
<i>♪ Ish-ka-me-me, so-la-me-me</i>
<i>Oo-wak-a-awak-a-me-me ♪</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:48.486
<i>♪ Ish-ka-me-me, so-la-me-me</i>
<i>Oo-wak-a-awak-a-me-me ♪</i>

08:48.569 --> 08:51.239

<i>Wak-a-wak-a-choten ♪</i>

08:51.322 --> 08:54.200
<i>♪ Yup-diddly-oten-doten-oo</i>
<i>Wak-a-wak-a-choten ♪</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
Well, that's it. You're one of us.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.504
Boy, Minh is a breath of fresh air.

09:06.629 --> 09:11.384
She's like a spiky-haired New Wave rocker
giving a jolt of raw energy

09:11.467 --> 09:15.012
to the bloated arena band
that was once our gun club.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.014
Yesterday, my doctor told me--

09:17.098 --> 09:18.307
Minh is the coolest!

09:18.391 --> 09:20.017
She beat me at Stratego!

09:20.101 --> 09:22.228
And she can belch just like a dude!

09:25.523 --> 09:27.400
It all sounds so glamorous.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
Sounds like Minh's out of ammo.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.701
-Are you gonna get it?
-You got it last time.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.868
Oh, no, me! I'll get it!

09:37.952 --> 09:39.954
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Minh!

09:40.037 --> 09:43.958
So you guys ever think about
building a skeet-shooting range?

09:44.041 --> 09:45.293
No.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.128
Is that what you want us to think about?

09:47.211 --> 09:50.423
I just asked because there's this contest
I thought we could enter.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.550
The Tri-Club Skeet Classic.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.635
That's why we admire you, Minh.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.513
You're always dreaming up
new things to shoot.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.889
Count us in!

10:03.060 --> 10:04.520
He picked the locks.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.439
Who is this monster?

10:06.522 --> 10:08.232
I don't see garbage.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.693
I see a bag of clues.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.156
I'm going in!

10:18.284 --> 10:20.328
So we on track with hillbillies?

10:20.411 --> 10:22.246
They eating out of my hand.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.540
I even got them building a skeet range.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.000
Ah, perfect!

10:26.083 --> 10:28.586
By the way, why you cleaning so many guns?

10:28.669 --> 10:30.129
Oh, these are Fitzi's.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.799
He always forgets to lube the obverse side
of the trigger.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.676
And you should have seen Moose today.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.844
He fell down in the grass.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.722
And when he got up,
he had leaves all stuck in his beard.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.848
It was so cute.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.351
Minh, don't go native on me.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.853
Me? No. Relax.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.903
You know, some of the things Gribble
says about JFK and Oswald

10:53.986 --> 10:57.657
sound crazy at first
but if you really follow the money...

11:11.045 --> 11:11.962
Pull!

11:14.507 --> 11:15.633
Oh!

11:27.228 --> 11:28.270
Pull!

11:34.276 --> 11:35.444
Pull!

11:41.575 --> 11:43.911
That's six perfect sets in a row.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.413
We got a deal or not?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.916
Minh, Kahn, welcome to Nine Rivers.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.670
Lead us to victory against those snobs
at Pennington Oaks.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.426
-Yes!
-Congratulations, Kahn.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.887
By the way, there's a refresher course
in club etiquette that you'll be taking.

12:06.225 --> 12:11.397
Minh, my love, tonight,
the first night of the rest of our lives.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.901
I making farewell-to-rednecks video.

12:15.985 --> 12:20.281
I'm gonna tell each individual hillbilly
to go to hell in my own words.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.490
Want to do Peggy Hill?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.285
-I don't know.
-Come on. It's fun.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.579
Dear redneck ogress...

12:28.956 --> 12:32.877
Minh, we had matching t-shirts made
for the shooting contest.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.422
Don't worry. I already washed yours.
I know how much you're afraid of pinkeye.

12:36.505 --> 12:40.426
-Oh, that's sweet. But, see--
-And look.

12:40.509 --> 12:45.681
We changed your code name to President
Minh because we elected you president.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
Yup. I resigned just for you.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.145
Uh...

12:51.228 --> 12:52.646
Guys, look...

12:53.355 --> 12:56.525
I just got asked to shoot
for Nine Rivers Skeet Team.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.528
So I'm gonna be over there from now on.

13:00.529 --> 13:05.618
Wait. So are you gonna shoot
for them and us?

13:05.701 --> 13:08.454
I'm not sure I understand.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.539
No. Only them.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.294
Oh, guys, it's, it's complicated.

13:15.377 --> 13:19.381
You took an oath to be loyal
to your fellow members.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.009
Well, I only swore on a beer can.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.472
Yeah.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.974
So I guess that means it never counted.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.100
Come on, guys.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
Okay, great. You already handled Gribble.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.564
Now, come on back inside
so we can do Bobby Hill.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.906
You must eat.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.783
You need energy for big winning day.

13:45.866 --> 13:49.078
I don't deserve to eat or to win.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.289
Don't be upset about rednecks.
They like earthworms.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.543
Barely have nervous system.
They don't really feel pain.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.504
They trusted me and I betrayed them.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.382
That hilarious.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.342
They were dopey hillbillies to trust you.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.177
And then you cleverly betrayed them.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.182
Thinks she's better than us?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.518
I'll show her.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.232
We'll see about you, Minh!

14:18.691 --> 14:19.567
Pull!

14:27.199 --> 14:29.910
I'm not finished! Load it again!

14:40.087 --> 14:41.338
Who are we kidding?

14:41.422 --> 14:44.425
-She is better than us.
-In fact, yes.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.344
Yet I still feel the need to take revenge.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.262
But how?

14:50.514 --> 14:51.807
Wait a minute.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.267
We've got guns!

14:53.350 --> 14:57.688
We can break into their snooty club
and wreck their snooty contest!

14:57.771 --> 14:59.607
Wreck it? With what?

14:59.690 --> 15:01.025
With our guns!

15:05.696 --> 15:09.783
Another empty jelly jar
filled with used Q-tips.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.202
This is not worth it.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.747
Well, justice isn't always pleasant.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.290
Well, it's not hard data.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.542
But at least we can assemble a profile.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.295
Our perp is a dirty man with clean ears.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.884
As you can see, we've expanded.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.888
We were finally able to take over
the deaf children's academy next door.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.223
They put up quite a fight.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.143
Oh, the beauty stomps my heart.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.811
How are your spirits, Minh?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.981
You do realize
we're counting on you today.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.192
Yeah, I know.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.073
Where's the gun range?

15:49.156 --> 15:52.409
Well, it's not on this side
or it would scare the koi.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.827
To that side!

16:06.882 --> 16:09.009
-Did you see that?
-What's going on?

16:09.093 --> 16:11.178
As first-time hosts of this event,

16:11.261 --> 16:15.015
we are proud to welcome the reigning
skeet champions, Club Pennington Oaks.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.937
In the spirit of friendly rivalry,
allow me to say

16:20.938 --> 16:23.190
Pennington Oaks, today you are going down.

16:28.028 --> 16:28.946
Pardon me.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.906
And now let's do it. Let's shoot!

16:35.536 --> 16:37.329
Good heavens!

16:37.413 --> 16:39.039
It's Atlantis!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.422
-Oh, who are they?
-They're not members!

16:52.052 --> 16:54.013
They got music under the water!

16:58.434 --> 16:59.852
You there!

16:59.935 --> 17:03.022
-Can I help you?
-No, thanks. We're doing fine.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.481
Oh-oh.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.983
Run!

17:10.487 --> 17:13.407
You're gunning 10 for 10. Spectacular.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.534
Ace this round and we're home free.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.499
On your count.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.596
Gribble? Why the hell you come here?

17:35.679 --> 17:38.557
At first, revenge.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.019
But now, we're too impressed by the luxury
to stay mad at you!

17:42.102 --> 17:44.063
That pool's, like, 80 degrees!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.398
And did you see they have a tortoise
walking around?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.192
Hand over your weapons!

17:56.950 --> 17:59.953
What is the meaning of this?
Minh, do you know these people?

18:00.662 --> 18:01.538
Uh...

18:03.624 --> 18:05.000
Uh...

18:07.669 --> 18:11.715
Yeah. I'm their president.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.842
Whatever that means.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.888
I still want them ejected and prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

18:23.227 --> 18:27.231
Oh, wait! They're my guests!

18:29.316 --> 18:33.654
I used all my guest passes so my friends
could cheer me on today.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.322
They must have gotten lost.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.240
Right, guys?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.616
Minh, you crazy!

18:37.699 --> 18:39.576
You gonna blow all our guest passes!

18:39.660 --> 18:42.412
How I supposed to impress
my work superiors?

18:42.496 --> 18:44.832
I got us in here, Kahn, so it's my call.

18:44.915 --> 18:45.958
Take it or leave it!

18:48.710 --> 18:51.839
Your guest-pass privileges
will certainly be under review.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.049
But now, Minh, you're up.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.342
Oh. Right.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.101
Pull!

19:08.814 --> 19:11.191
<i>Match, Nine Rivers.</i>

19:11.275 --> 19:12.609
Yeah!

19:20.367 --> 19:21.869
Okay, with that fingernail,

19:21.952 --> 19:25.122
we now know that the culprit
has at least eight fingers.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.212
Aunt Peggy, are we having
an indoor yard sale?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.090
Look, baby girl. My spare keys.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.134
I must have tossed them by mistake.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.179
Lucky, is this your trash?

19:40.262 --> 19:43.849
Sure is. Government wants to charge me
a garbage tax.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.768
Hell no! Don't tread on me, I say.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.313
I figure since we're family,
you'd want to help.

19:51.773 --> 19:56.069
Lucky, I demand that you stop putting
your garbage in my cans!

20:03.827 --> 20:08.790
Nothing like seeing your garbage laid out
to make you realize how fortunate you are.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.753
To live in a country where you can eat
Chinese chicken salad one day

20:12.836 --> 20:14.838
and baklava the next.

20:14.922 --> 20:18.258
If I got to pay a little extra
to get rid of my refuse, so be it.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.510
God bless America.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.597
That was beautiful, Lucky.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.232
This Maytag Bleu is an explosion
of sophisticated flavors.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.401
And this 97 Pinot has its own story.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.905
It's the au pair who slaps you
after you chase her into the kitchen.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.782
Yeah. Yeah.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.408
I really taste that.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.830
-Hello?
-Minh, you won't believe

20:48.914 --> 20:50.249
what happened just now!

20:50.332 --> 20:54.795
That whole "looking before you shoot"
thing you taught us really does work!

20:54.878 --> 20:58.173
<i>Me and Moose just hit
two traps</i><i>in only eight shots!</i>

20:58.257 --> 20:59.549
Amazing!

20:59.633 --> 21:00.676
Put Moose on.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.427
Moose...

21:04.680 --> 21:05.514
Talk later.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.645
Sorry. Bit of private business.
