(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

00:19.602 --> 00:21.568
I was told you
have news for me.

00:22.502 --> 00:24.102
Indeed I do.

00:28.835 --> 00:29.835
Well?

00:31.202 --> 00:34.468
My spies have travelled
all the known lands.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.502
They returned with
many interesting stories.

00:37.535 --> 00:41.702
I have no interest in stories,
just the information
I paid for.

00:41.735 --> 00:43.302
(CHUCKLES)

00:43.335 --> 00:48.468
One of these stories tells
of a creature with
serpents for hair

00:48.502 --> 00:52.702
and a look that turns
both man and beast to stone.

00:52.735 --> 00:54.668
You found her? Where is she?

00:54.702 --> 00:55.802
(CHUCKLES)

00:58.235 --> 01:04.242
Your beloved Medusa
is to be found in a cave
on the shores of Cisthene.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.542
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:41.542 --> 01:44.242
Where in the name of the gods
have you been?

01:44.275 --> 01:45.575
The market, to buy some bread.

01:45.608 --> 01:48.075
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.608
-What's going on?
-It's Medusa.

01:49.642 --> 01:52.142
Crios has told me
where she can be found.

01:52.175 --> 01:53.942
Crios? The man is
a liar and a thief!

01:53.975 --> 01:58.175
If there is the slightest
chance of finding Medusa
I have to take it.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.115
You have the cure ready?

02:00.148 --> 02:02.982
-The cure?
-The cure. For Medusa.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.582
(SNIFFING)

02:04.615 --> 02:07.282
Oh, I stink.
I have to go to the baths.

02:07.315 --> 02:10.482
I want to be looking my best
when I see Medusa again.

02:10.515 --> 02:12.648
I haven't dared dream
this day would come.

02:12.682 --> 02:15.148
Oh! Praise the gods!

02:18.715 --> 02:21.282
Do you have a cure for Medusa?

02:21.315 --> 02:24.682
I promised
Hercules I would find one,

02:24.715 --> 02:28.115
but I haven't had the heart
to tell him that
I've completely failed.

02:31.115 --> 02:33.748
You have to tell Hercules.
You can't give him false hope.

02:33.782 --> 02:37.082
Hope is all he has,
and if I take that away...

02:38.348 --> 02:41.582
-Then you'll break his heart.
-I can't do that to him.

02:45.282 --> 02:47.948
There is one other
thing we could try.

02:47.982 --> 02:49.215
What?

02:50.715 --> 02:51.748
Uh...

02:51.782 --> 02:53.282
Why are you
looking at me like that?

02:53.315 --> 02:55.082
'Cause there's something
I need you to do,

02:55.115 --> 02:57.082
and I'm not sure
you're going to like it.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.255
I did not know
when I would see you again.

03:11.955 --> 03:13.422
I thought you saw everything.

03:14.522 --> 03:17.655
Only that which
the gods permit me to see.

03:19.455 --> 03:21.255
Is there something
you wish to know?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.955
It's not knowledge I seek.

03:24.688 --> 03:26.455
I need Pandora's Box.

03:28.122 --> 03:30.088
Why would you ask
for such a thing?

03:30.122 --> 03:32.655
You've seen the horrors
it can unleash.

03:32.688 --> 03:36.522
My friend believes it may
offer a clue as to how
to cure Medusa.

03:36.555 --> 03:40.688
I do not doubt that
your intentions are good,

03:40.722 --> 03:43.622
but the temptation
to open the box is too great.

03:43.655 --> 03:45.022
I cannot allow it.

03:45.055 --> 03:46.322
I was never tempted.

03:48.222 --> 03:52.655
You're only just beginning
to understand
the extent of your gifts.

03:52.688 --> 03:55.822
How can I understand them
when you won't tell me
where they came from?

03:55.855 --> 03:57.422
Do they come from my mother?

03:57.455 --> 03:59.528
You've not told me
anything about her.

03:59.562 --> 04:03.362
I've told you all that I know.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.862
Then why do all my instincts
tell me you're lying?

04:10.495 --> 04:14.262
I cannot give you
the knowledge that you seek,

04:17.495 --> 04:21.495
but I will give you the box,
if that's what you desire.

04:29.328 --> 04:32.062
So you really
think this Daedalus
will be able to help us?

04:32.095 --> 04:34.928
If anyone can. He is a genius.

04:34.961 --> 04:37.161
To him, I'm a fool.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.228
What's that make
the rest of us?

04:39.262 --> 04:42.295
To Daedalus,
it makes you
extremely annoying.

04:52.495 --> 04:54.062
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

04:56.362 --> 04:58.062
Daedalus?

04:59.062 --> 05:01.535
Perhaps he's in the back.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.902
What is all this stuff?

05:03.935 --> 05:07.102
Daedalus is a man of science,
an inventor.

05:08.402 --> 05:10.402
This is his life's work.

05:12.968 --> 05:15.968
Whatever you do,
don't touch anything.

05:16.468 --> 05:17.568
Right.

05:21.302 --> 05:22.502
Daedalus?

05:33.168 --> 05:34.902
Who are you?
What're you doing?

05:34.935 --> 05:37.868
-Sorry, I was...
-This is my friend, Jason.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.868
A silly little boy,
that's what he is.

05:39.902 --> 05:42.635
Can't keep his
fingers to himself,
can you?

05:42.668 --> 05:43.902
Touching and poking.

05:43.935 --> 05:46.502
Poke, poke, poke.

05:46.535 --> 05:48.668
Poke, poke, poke, poke.

05:48.702 --> 05:49.802
Stop poking me.

05:49.835 --> 05:51.502
He meant no harm.

05:52.468 --> 05:54.468
The box. Show him the box.

05:56.335 --> 05:58.402
Ah. This is the box
you told me about?

05:59.608 --> 06:01.075
It's a source of great evil.

06:02.808 --> 06:05.508
Seems such
a simple little box.

06:05.542 --> 06:09.242
Don't be fooled
by its appearance.
It must remain unopened.

06:12.942 --> 06:18.608
Well, perhaps it wouldn't hurt
to have a quick peek inside.

06:18.642 --> 06:20.775
Daedalus!

06:20.808 --> 06:25.975
This is what I
warned you about.
The box cannot be opened.

06:26.008 --> 06:29.042
It must be sealed shut
before you examine it.

06:30.175 --> 06:33.142
Then I have just the thing.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.908
Hmm?

06:40.975 --> 06:42.675
There is but one key.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.008
I'll take it.

06:45.808 --> 06:48.175
I don't like him,
not one little bit.

should leave us to it.

-So, these markings...
-You think they
mean something?

07:12.615 --> 07:15.548
Of course they mean something.
Everything means something.

07:15.582 --> 07:19.082
The question is, what?
What do they mean?

07:19.115 --> 07:23.282
-I... I don't know.
-I know,
I'm surrounded by fools.

07:26.315 --> 07:30.715
Ah, I believe these are words.

07:30.748 --> 07:35.382
You say this box belonged
to Pandora,
the first woman on earth?

07:35.415 --> 07:38.115
That is the legend.

07:38.148 --> 07:41.748
Then this was forged
in the time of
the ancient tongue.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.282
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

08:01.955 --> 08:03.155
Perhaps it is
another language?

08:03.188 --> 08:05.355
No, no, no.
It's of the ancient tongue.

08:05.388 --> 08:07.088
I'm certain of it. (READING)

08:34.555 --> 08:39.022
Yeah.
Hope. Man's eternal optimism.

08:39.055 --> 08:41.722
Does this mean
there is hope for Medusa?

08:41.755 --> 08:43.188
Well, you have hope for her.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.022
Your stupid fat
friend Hercules,
he has hope for her.

08:46.055 --> 08:49.222
I even have hope
for my foolish son Icarus.

08:49.255 --> 08:52.422
There's no shortage
of hope in this world.

08:53.422 --> 08:55.355
Just shortage of brains.

When all seems lost,

08:59.128 --> 09:02.962
hope still remains.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.295
Yes, of course.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.362
These markings,
I didn't
understand them at first,

-but now it's clear.
-Is it?

09:10.528 --> 09:15.128
Yes, yes.
They tell
the story of Alcestis,

09:19.228 --> 09:21.162
Alcestis and Admetus.

09:23.562 --> 09:26.428
It would seem
there is a cure for Medusa.

09:26.462 --> 09:29.095
How? How can she be cured?

You know, as stupid as he is,
I pity your friend Hercules,

09:34.062 --> 09:37.828
because the price of the cure
is his own life.

09:43.043 --> 09:45.177

You look cleaner.

-No.

insist we smell your armpits?

and the nostrils.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.017
Well?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.350
I'm no closer to
finding a cure.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.450
You said you knew
how to cure her?

10:21.483 --> 10:23.483
I said no such thing,
you just assumed.

10:23.517 --> 10:25.450
You believed
the box might hold a clue.

10:25.483 --> 10:27.383
I was wrong.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.217
The markings on the box
are simply decorative.

10:32.517 --> 10:34.517
You should return
it to The Oracle.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.917
Maybe you should sleep on it.

10:35.950 --> 10:38.283
You get some of
your best ideas
when you're asleep.

10:38.317 --> 10:41.717
Triangles.
That came to
you in your sleep.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.383
Most men dream about women,
you dream about triangles.

Yes, go, go, go.

hasn't even set yet.

-Hercules...

10:56.750 --> 10:58.217
There must be a way.

nothing more I can do.

that you haven't found a cure,

11:48.923 --> 11:51.023
but it's not your fault.

11:51.890 --> 11:53.690
How is he?

11:53.723 --> 11:56.090
He hasn't come
out of his room.

11:57.290 --> 12:00.457
He blames himself
for what happened to Medusa.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.363
Sometimes I think the guilt
is too much for him to bear.

12:04.963 --> 12:07.730
That's what I'm worried about.

12:07.763 --> 12:10.363
In this state,
he's capable of anything.

What is it?

12:15.763 --> 12:17.963
I'm just worried about him.

can't cheer him up.

I would imagine he's
on his way to the shores
of Cisthene to see Medusa.

about where Medusa is...

I speak the truth.

we can catch up with him.

up with Hercules
you should worry about.

Well, I doubt very much
he'll make it past Calydon.

is a band of
Scythians in the forest.

Hercules of the danger?

stopped him if I had?

32:48.533 --> 32:52.033
If I was truly angry,
I'd have dropped you headfirst
from the balcony.

32:52.067 --> 32:54.000
You're fortunate
I am so even tempered.

32:54.033 --> 32:55.333
Anyway...

32:58.000 --> 32:59.867
I'm sorry about Medusa.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.733
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

33:05.707 --> 33:09.740
Whatever you do,
even when I'm too
pig-headed to see it,

33:09.773 --> 33:12.140
I know you've always got
my best interests at heart.

33:12.173 --> 33:15.007
You're a good
friend to me, Pythagoras.

33:17.673 --> 33:19.140
Better than you deserve.

33:19.740 --> 33:20.740
No.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.740
-Probably.
-(CHUCKLES)

33:29.173 --> 33:30.640
We should get some sleep.

33:39.873 --> 33:41.340
What is it?

33:42.507 --> 33:44.107
It's nothing.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.273
Go to sleep.

33:54.522 --> 33:55.689
(SIGHS)

34:14.364 --> 34:16.864
-Hercules?
-Oh, you're awake.

34:16.897 --> 34:20.139
You're alive. And eating?

34:21.764 --> 34:23.697
Where's Atalanta?

34:23.731 --> 34:25.331
When we woke, she'd gone.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.131
She left some pigeons
roasting on the fire.

34:28.164 --> 34:29.731
Quite a woman.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.264
I was just thinking,

34:33.297 --> 34:35.931
maybe I should continue
on to the shores
of Cisthene alone.

34:35.964 --> 34:38.164
You should head
back to Atlantis,

34:38.197 --> 34:40.197
make sure Jason's wound
is properly seen to.

34:40.231 --> 34:43.831
Uh, my wound's healed.

34:43.864 --> 34:47.164
We didn't come all this way
to turn back now.

34:47.197 --> 34:50.297
We journey to the shores
of Cisthene together.

34:51.831 --> 34:53.264
Excellent.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.297
What is it?

35:02.864 --> 35:06.204
Atalanta said our paths
would cross in the future.

35:06.937 --> 35:09.037
Let us hope that is true.

35:22.171 --> 35:26.404
Crios said the stories
spoke of Medusa
being in a cave.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.737
There are dozens of them.

35:32.771 --> 35:36.037
HERCULES: Then we must search
them all until we find her.

35:59.604 --> 36:02.771
I thought you'd be
more excited to see her.

36:02.804 --> 36:04.304
Hmm?

36:04.337 --> 36:07.244
I thought you'd be more
excited to see Medusa.

36:07.277 --> 36:09.511
Oh, I am. Yes.
I was just thinking about

36:09.544 --> 36:12.377
everything that's happened
since you arrived in Atlantis.

36:12.411 --> 36:15.211
All the trouble
you've got us into.

36:15.244 --> 36:16.277
Sorry.

36:16.311 --> 36:18.077
I wouldn't have changed it
for the world.

36:18.111 --> 36:20.177
Well, some of it.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.177
I, uh...
I just wanted you to know.

36:24.277 --> 36:25.311
What?

36:27.044 --> 36:28.477
Over here!

36:33.577 --> 36:35.111
Look.

36:35.144 --> 36:36.777
They've been turned to stone.

36:36.811 --> 36:39.177
-Medusa.
-She's waiting for you.

36:46.511 --> 36:48.711
Perhaps we could
have a moment alone?

36:50.611 --> 36:52.044
Of course.

36:54.677 --> 36:55.944
Just don't look at her.

36:57.277 --> 36:58.444
I won't.

37:02.544 --> 37:04.344
I won't forget what
you've done for me.

37:18.517 --> 37:19.850
Medusa?

37:26.451 --> 37:28.051
Medusa?

37:28.084 --> 37:30.451
MEDUSA:
You shouldn't have come.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.717
I had to.

37:32.751 --> 37:36.184
Even though I cannot look
at you, just to hear your
voice is enough.

37:40.317 --> 37:41.984
(SNAKES HISSING)

37:42.017 --> 37:43.617
(MEDUSA SOBBING)

37:44.884 --> 37:47.151
It is so good to see you.

37:47.184 --> 37:49.451
There isn't a day
when I don't think of you.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.651
I wish more than anything

37:52.551 --> 37:55.217
to hold you in my arms.

37:55.251 --> 37:57.917
We both know
that isn't possible.

37:57.951 --> 37:59.884
It never will be.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.884
You should not lose hope.

38:01.917 --> 38:06.124
How can I have hope when even
the rats don't
dare come near me?

38:08.091 --> 38:10.824
PYTHAGORAS:
Seeing Medusa as she is,

38:10.857 --> 38:13.991
I worry it will only
make Hercules sadder.

38:14.024 --> 38:15.357
Well,
maybe until we find a cure,

38:15.391 --> 38:18.191
it's better than not seeing
her at all.

38:21.324 --> 38:23.857
What if I were to tell you
I have found a cure?

38:25.957 --> 38:27.557
Why wouldn't you say anything?

38:27.591 --> 38:31.791
Because it requires Hercules
to sacrifice his
life for Medusa's.

38:33.657 --> 38:35.857
I couldn't bear to tell him.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.091
I can't see him die.

38:47.257 --> 38:48.391
He knows.

38:49.524 --> 38:51.491
He can't.

38:51.524 --> 38:52.824
Why would you think that?

38:52.857 --> 38:55.757
When he thanked us
for all that
we'd done for him.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.491
He was saying goodbye.

38:59.891 --> 39:02.791
Seeing the life
you're condemned to lead,

39:03.457 --> 39:06.397
alone, in this cave.

39:08.864 --> 39:10.397
This is all my doing.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.797
MEDUSA:
I don't want you
to blame yourself.

39:13.831 --> 39:16.064
It seems this was my fate.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.097
It doesn't have to be.

39:22.831 --> 39:25.031
I said I would find a cure,

39:26.231 --> 39:27.531
and I have.

39:29.697 --> 39:32.431
There's a cure? How?

39:33.631 --> 39:36.831
Swear to me
you will do exactly as I ask.

39:38.797 --> 39:40.764
-Promise me.
-Anything.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.031
No! You'll be
turned to stone! (GASPS)

39:46.064 --> 39:48.831
Trust me.
If you love me,
you'll do this.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.397
MEDUSA:
I love you with all my heart.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.964
Then look at me and
you will be cured.

39:52.997 --> 39:54.497
What will happen to you?

39:54.531 --> 39:56.364
Nothing. Don't worry about me.

39:56.397 --> 39:59.164
Just know that I love you.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.331
Look at me.

40:05.697 --> 40:07.304
(SNAKES HISSING)

40:11.204 --> 40:13.837
How is it possible
for you to look at me?

40:14.804 --> 40:15.871
I don't know.

40:15.904 --> 40:18.837
Let me go. Let me look at her.

40:18.871 --> 40:21.304
He was going to give his life
so that you would be cured.

40:21.337 --> 40:22.471
No.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.937
Let me do this for her.

40:24.971 --> 40:26.704
You think I could
live with myself,

40:26.737 --> 40:29.037
knowing you had
given your life for mine?

40:29.071 --> 40:31.804
You have to.
It's your only hope.

40:31.837 --> 40:34.104
I would do
anything for a cure.

40:36.737 --> 40:39.304
Anything but this.

40:39.337 --> 40:42.104
Knowing we could
never be together,

40:43.937 --> 40:45.771
I would rather stay cursed.

40:55.571 --> 40:58.071
Has anyone been
turned to stone yet?

41:05.271 --> 41:07.177
I'm sorry I lied to you.

41:08.411 --> 41:10.644
You were right.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.744
I don't deserve
such a good friend.

41:15.111 --> 41:16.777
But I am grateful.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.777
Let's go home.

41:26.111 --> 41:30.444
I won't stop searching
until I find another cure.

41:30.477 --> 41:33.611
We'll return as
soon as we find one.
I promise.

41:33.644 --> 41:35.644
MEDUSA: I know you will,

41:35.677 --> 41:37.777
and that gives me
a reason to live.
