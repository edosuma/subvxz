01:21.381 --> 01:23.679
- Mr. Gray, good morning.
- Mr. Gray, Ari?

01:23.716 --> 01:25.274
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that

01:25.318 --> 01:26.808
if you want to get Vince
on "Smokejumpers."

01:26.853 --> 01:29.253
Just wanted to show you
the respect that a studio head deserves.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.813
Well, that's very nice, Ari.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.984
Maybe if your client had done
the same on "Aquaman 2"

01:33.026 --> 01:34.960
you wouldn't be in such
a desperate position.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.723
Come on, hasn't the kid
suffered enough?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.095
Roasting him on a spit
wouldn't be enough suffering

01:39.132 --> 01:41.566
- as far as I'm concerned.
- Really?

01:41.601 --> 01:45.059
Alan, I mean, come on.
We're talking about the second lead here.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.097
Vincent Chase is not
gonna be the second lead nor the third.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.302
In fact, he's not even gonna
be the toothless waitress

01:50.343 --> 01:52.504
whose one line is,
"We're all out of blueberries."

01:52.545 --> 01:54.877
Goodbye, Ari.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.348
Who holds a grudge
this long?

01:57.383 --> 01:59.749
Women and gays.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.117
It's true.
Look it up.

02:01.154 --> 02:03.088
I don't understand.
"Aquaman 2" did good.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.556
You'd think he'd get
over it by now.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.991
- He hasn't, so we have to move on.
- Move on to what?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.017
Steve Parles
loved meeting you.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.690
And he was serious
about "Benji."

02:11.731 --> 02:13.995
- Oh come on.
- No, he's dead serious.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.467
Now I don't normally sit home
on a Friday night and read...

02:16.503 --> 02:18.596
wife and the kids are up
in Santa Barbara, so I did.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.230
- And it's good?
- It's "Benji."

02:20.273 --> 02:23.436
- In the Arctic?
- Is this Benji the dog we're talking about?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.967
No, it's Benji Franklin
who goes to the Arctic, you idiot.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.742
- So did Steve make a real offer?
- Is $3 million real?

02:28.781 --> 02:32.114
- Ruff ruff.
- That's why I had to bring it to you.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.847
- How's the script, really?
- I cried.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.616
Now I don't know if I was
crying because of the script

02:35.655 --> 02:37.680
or the fact that I'm trying
to put you in a Benji movie,

02:37.724 --> 02:39.419
but I sat at home alone

02:39.459 --> 02:41.825
last night in my bed
and I wept.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.692
Well, I guess I'd better
read it then.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.702
You don't have to read it, Vince,
because it is exactly what you think it is.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.296
And if you take it,
you're taking it for the same reason

02:52.338 --> 02:54.499
that most people
in America take jobs...

02:54.541 --> 02:56.133
because you need the money.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.940
We've never made a decision
based on money alone.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.138
Vince, I have cash
to tide us over.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.579
- Oh, Jesus.
- Well, I do.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.912
I have a few shekels
put away too, bro.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.384
I can make my own money. And I take
care of you guys when you need it.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.785
- Nobody takes care of me.
- Appreciate that, Vin.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.119
What the fuck?

03:11.157 --> 03:13.455
Hey hey hey, asshole.
What are you doing to our cars?

03:13.493 --> 03:15.017
- They're being repossessed.
- What?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.551
Pay your bills, deadbeat.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.723
What the fuck are you talking about,
you motherfucker?

03:18.765 --> 03:20.494
Vin!

03:24.337 --> 03:26.134
So what's the role?

03:26.172 --> 03:28.037
It's the young veterinarian
Mitch Kreeger.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.008
Who gets top billing,
Vince or the dog?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.102
- That's a good question, Turtle.
- It's legitimate.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.045
All right, let's discuss
the downside.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.707
Won't be banging
your co-star.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.773
It is a G-rated
family film.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.285
If it's somehow "Babe"
we're great.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.947
And if it's "Garfield"
and it blows up

03:41.988 --> 03:44.388
like Barry Bonds's
skull we're finished.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.551
- I don't like this.
- How long do we have to decide?

03:46.593 --> 03:48.060
Parles wants an answer
by Monday.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.892
Let's go to Villa, look at
some nice asses jiggle,

03:50.930 --> 03:52.761
and the answer
will come to us.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.528
No no no no.
Forget that.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.159
There's only one place
for real answers.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.897
Oh yeah?
Where's that, Johnny?

03:57.937 --> 03:59.734
- Joshua Tree.
- Joshua Tree?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.332
No phones, no Berries.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.570
Just us men
and our souls.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.272
And a big bag
of shrooms.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.610
- That sounds idiotic.
- No no no, I like it.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.116
- Are you in, Ari?
- For shrooming in the desert?

04:11.150 --> 04:14.449
No, for being there to help guide us
through this major decision.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.752
Okay, I'm in.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.552
Great.
Where do we get the shrooms?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.923
Eric Roberts,
where else?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.259
Let me see them hands.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.093
I've got a shotgun
pointed at the door.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.361
Yo, ER, chill.
It's Drama and Vince.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.730
I'm just playing
with you, Johnny.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.601
Good to see you.
Hey, Vince, how you doing?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.004
- Eric.
- How you doing?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.405
- Turtle.
- How are ya?

04:35.441 --> 04:38.308
Well, if it's not an ass
who needs wiping, Ari Gold.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.141
How's it hanging, player?

04:40.179 --> 04:42.511
- Oh, it's hanging.
- Been a long time, huh?

04:42.548 --> 04:45.108
- Yeah, what 10 years, huh?
- About that.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.051
- How are you?
- Solid as a rock.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.884
In fact, take a fucking swing, Gold.
Abs of steel.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.720
I'd rather not.

04:52.759 --> 04:56.058
- Either you swing or I do.
- Okay.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.962
And don't Jew me on this, Gold.
Put some muscle behind it.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.069
50 years old,
I'm still an animal.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.197
Anybody else
want to pound the stone?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.367
- You want to pound this stone?
- No no no no.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.377
No thanks, we're good.
We got a long drive ahead of us.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.776
We just came by to grab

05:12.812 --> 05:14.905
some of your famous magical fungi
and we were gonna roll.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.939
You'll be thrilled to know I just harvested
a sweet sweet batch.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.747
- Awesome.
- So where you guys going?

05:19.786 --> 05:22.619
- Joshua Tree.
- Joshua Tree? I love that place.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.215
Peace, serenity, nature.
Speaking of which, say hi to Mark.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.089
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.320
So what's the reason
for this journey?

05:28.361 --> 05:31.125
I have a major career
decision to make.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.791
Oh yeah?
Heavy.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.063
You know, I love observing
people in transition.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.002
It's good for my work.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.698
Would you guys mind
if I tagged along?

05:39.739 --> 05:41.229
No no, you can come.
It's cool.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.902
Actually, you know, Vinnie,
there's not enough room in my car.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.774
That's okay, Gold.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.780
We can take my one-
of-a-kind Winnebago.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.813
This is quite
the ride, Eric.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.553
Thanks.
Back in '91 me and this baby

06:00.593 --> 06:02.993
hit every one of
the continental 48 states,

06:03.029 --> 06:06.089
with the exception of Montana
where I'm no longer legally welcome.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.532
So where we gonna sleep
when we get there?

06:08.568 --> 06:10.365
They have like
a B&B or something?

06:10.403 --> 06:13.236
- Ha!
- Ha what? What's the plan?

06:13.272 --> 06:16.708
You eat the shrooms, you trip,
you leave when you come down.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.303
Translation: You're sleeping,
you're sleeping in the dirt.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.404
I don't even know
if I'm gonna be taking shrooms, okay?

06:21.447 --> 06:24.541
Let's compromise. I can get us
a phat house at the Madison Club.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.814
Wake up, play a nice round
of golf in the AM.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.651
- What do you say?
- Come on, Ari, it's man and nature.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.055
You know how many good times this crew
has had without a real place to sleep?

06:32.091 --> 06:33.388
Remember Lake Barrington?

06:33.426 --> 06:35.155
All we had was six bags of Doritos
and some sleeping bags.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.719
And Drama brought the extra bags,
he was still wetting the bed at 14.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.028
Liar. I stopped wetting
the bed when I was nine.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.500
That extra bag
was for warmth.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.002
You were still wetting
the bed at nine?

06:44.036 --> 06:46.971
A lot of great artists
are late to potty-train.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.634
I was housebroken at 16 months.
True story.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.666
True story, we could be
at Villa tonight.

06:51.711 --> 06:52.735
What are you
gonna do at Villa?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.212
The only thing
I can do, E...

06:54.247 --> 06:56.215
find a nice image
to whack off to.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.417
No phones on this
trip, Ari.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.851
I need a dog-sitter,
dickhead.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.219
Make it fast or I'm gonna
chuck you and that device

07:03.256 --> 07:04.655
out the door while
we're moving, Ari.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.419
Where the hell
are you, Lloyd?

07:06.459 --> 07:09.860
It's Saturday, Ari. I really don't think
that's any of your concern.

07:09.896 --> 07:13.161
Your whereabouts are my concern
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.598
So says you.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.625
What, are you trying to put
on a show to impress Tom?

07:16.669 --> 07:19.502
- No. Tom's not even here.
- Really?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.131
- Tell him to suck it.
- Shh.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.608
Tell him I heard that
and tell him I will seal up

07:23.643 --> 07:26.407
your asshole with cement
if I am disrespected.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.414
Stop it, Ari.
Stop it.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.712
It's Saturday
and I work 80 hours a week

07:30.750 --> 07:33.913
and I should not have to be subjected
to this kind of talk on my weekend.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.285
You're right, you're right.
Lloyd, I am sorry, okay?

07:36.322 --> 07:38.415
This is not work related.
I need to ask you a favor.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.552
- What kind of favor?
- I need you to watch Lily tonight.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.722
- Where is your family?
- Aunt Pearl's 75th in Santa Barbara.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.790
- And where are you?
- I am away on business.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.200
What kind of business do you
have on a Saturday night?

07:50.236 --> 07:52.170
I got none
of your fucking business.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.264
I got a wife who thinks
I'm under a pile of scripts

07:54.307 --> 07:56.673
- and a dog that needs some love.
- We have plans tonight.

07:56.709 --> 08:00.008
Well, break your fucking plans.
I own your Asian ass.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.809
I thought
this was a favor.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.406
It is a favor to you.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.280
A favor
to keep you employed.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.343
You are a manipulative
meanie, Ari.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.324
It's Katie Morgan.
Yo yo, what's up, ladies?

08:12.358 --> 08:13.416
Hey.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.360
My regards to Tom.
Ciao.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.455
Hey, Vince, are you coming
to Vegas for the AVNs?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.524
Actually, we were going
to Joshua Tree.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.468
Cool.
I did a gang-bang scene there last year.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.869
Yeah? You want to do
the sequel this year?

08:25.905 --> 08:28.169
You guys should just come
to Vegas with us.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.402
- Yeah.
- Not this time, ladies.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.412
- We're sticking to the Tree.
- Aw!

08:33.446 --> 08:35.971
Okay, but it's gonna be
lonely out there.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.347
We will be thinking
of you the whole time.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.284
Yeah, well think
of this.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.780
Let me get your number.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.089
There's your image, Ari.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.386
Stop being a baby.

08:49.428 --> 08:51.191
I'm being a baby
'cause I'm the one

08:51.230 --> 08:53.721
who's gonna have to call
our friends and cancel again.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.291
- It's just game night.
- Maybe to you, Lloyd.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.735
But for some of us it's a night we look
forward to all week.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.204
Well, do you want me
to call everyone?

09:00.239 --> 09:01.570
No, I don't.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.508
I want you to figure out
a way to save the evening.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.808
There's no way, Tom.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.905
- Why don't we do it at Ari's?
- Oh, please.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.313
Come on, think about it.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.874
It could be your own personal
"fuck you" to Ari Gold.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.319
Fuck you to you, Tom.
There's no way.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.118
Don't be a pussy, Lloyd.
Come on.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.920
All right, I will be
responsible.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.792
If I don't make the place
absolutely perfect,

09:22.828 --> 09:24.853
even more perfect
than when we arrive,

09:24.897 --> 09:28.196
you can tie me up and put me
in the kennel for the day.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.566
You always say I can't.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.231
Well, I won't fail,
but, you know, if I do...

09:33.272 --> 09:34.796
arf!

09:52.124 --> 09:53.853
Oh yeah.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.862
This is where
we'll find answers.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.830
Everyone out.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.066
Phones and Berries
in the hat.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.968
- Even you, Ari.
- I've got kids, fuckhead.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.438
You know, you bring
any negative energy to the Tree, Ari

10:07.473 --> 10:10.374
I'm gonna crush your larynx and leave your
rotting corpse here for the coyotes to eat.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.969
We got to hang
more often, ER.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.742
Let him keep
his phone, Johnny.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.079
Whatever.
You got the bag?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.847
Bags...
just in case.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.251
Uno, dos.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.721
We're gonna
take 'em right now?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.724
You want to say
a few words first?

10:25.758 --> 10:27.726
No, I just thought
we'd settle in first, you know?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.284
E's nervous.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.394
You know, I'm not one
for babysitting,

10:32.431 --> 10:34.899
so if it's your first time,
I'm recommending half an eighth.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.494
- It's not my first time.
- Uh, yes it is.

10:37.536 --> 10:38.969
No it's not.
I ate a stem once.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.973
Yeah, but you threw it up
30 seconds after.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.534
Which is why I made you a peanut butter
and shroom sandwich this time.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.507
- Thanks, Drama.
- Yeah.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.413
You pack a lunch for the rest
of us or just junior?

10:50.449 --> 10:52.974
You work for us, Ari.
We don't work for you. Sorry.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.919
All right, let's do it.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.581
Not here.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.522
Where then?

11:08.134 --> 11:10.932
- Here.
- I like it.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.164
Here we go.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.569
All right, come on.
Let's eat.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.471
Here we go.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.543
What, peer pressure?
Fine.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.984
It tastes like shit.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.992
- That's 'cause they're grown in shit,
- Oh.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.357
This your first
time too, Ari?

11:35.394 --> 11:37.385
I thought everybody
ate shrooms in the '60s.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.058
- I was born in '67, fatboy.
- Oh.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.567
I never wanted to do a drug
that made me lose control.

11:42.601 --> 11:45.069
You don't lose control, Ari,
just all of your stresses.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.038
Exactly.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.474
At this moment none of us have
a care in the world.

11:54.413 --> 11:57.348
Everybody, welcome.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.112
Hello.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.483
How are you?

12:09.495 --> 12:11.827
I don't feel anything.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.560
It's coming, Ari.
It's coming.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.500
Feeling anything, E?

12:16.535 --> 12:19.402
Can we please let Turtle
finish his story?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.497
I don't want to hear
about his first hand-job.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.236
- At least it was a job.
- Well, some of us are interested, Ari.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.109
Remember, the journey
begins at the beginning.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.273
So, Turtle, please,
go on.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.715
Anyway, she was slamming.
I mean, even Vince thought so.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.844
Remember, Vince?

12:33.886 --> 12:36.013
Listen, I hate to miss this,
but it's the wife.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.523
Hold on.
Hello.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.718
We could kill him
and no one would know.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.955
- Hello?
- Hello?

12:42.995 --> 12:45.020
- Hey, baby, is that you?
- I can't really hear you.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.725
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.030
- Ari?
- Yeah, I can hear you, honey.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.127
Hi. Listen, I just
wanted to tell you

12:51.170 --> 12:53.400
I think we're coming
home tonight.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.963
You're coming home
tonight?

12:55.007 --> 12:57.339
- Hello?
- No, honey, why...

12:57.376 --> 12:59.071
honey, why would you
come home tonight?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.238
- Hello?
- Honey?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.372
Hello?

13:02.414 --> 13:03.813
Fuck.
Fuck!

13:03.849 --> 13:06.750
- She's coming home tonight.
- So what?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.016
So I'm here,
I'm supposed to be there.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.022
I don't have
any reception.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.115
You're walking around
in circles, Ari.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.150
I'm trying to
get a signal.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.856
I understand. That's why I was gonna
tell you to head up.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.928
- Up?
- Up.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.936
I'd hurry though.
You'll be tripping soon enough.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.699
- Christ.
- Don't tell him that.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.331
Hey, don't worry.
You're fine.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.832
It's a slow-acting batch.
You've got 10, 15 minutes.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.110
- Can he really get service up there?
- I have no idea.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.087
I think I feel something.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.093
Maybe it was a fast-
acting batch.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.269
Maya, get off.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.472
Maya, would you leave
your cousin alone?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.480
Sarah, could you
do something?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.072
Like what?

14:10.115 --> 14:12.640
- Hello?
- Hey, can you hear me?

14:14.186 --> 14:16.279
Why are you coming
home tonight?

14:16.322 --> 14:18.847
I'm coming home because
your son is throwing a fit.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.552
But it'll be night soon.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.027
Ari?
Hello?

14:23.062 --> 14:25.963
- It'll be night soon.
- You just said that.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.296
It'll be night soon

14:28.334 --> 14:29.961
and it's a long drive.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.560
You wait till morning.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.765
I would love to.
Just get your son to agree.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.364
Let me talk to him.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.773
Jonah, it's your father.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.405
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.975
Listen, don't cry.
You're gonna make Daddy cry.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.316
I just want to go home.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.151
I know.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.214
Tell Mama
to take me home.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.919
Buddy...

14:56.028 --> 14:58.360
I'll give you $100
if you stay till tomorrow.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.025
- Really?
- Really.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.001
- And a Transformer?
- You got it.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.628
Now will you stay?

15:06.705 --> 15:09.173
- Okay.
- Buddy...

15:09.208 --> 15:10.903
I love you.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.535
I bugged chewy top.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.136
What did you say?
What?

15:14.179 --> 15:16.044
I said I love you a lot.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.675
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.742
Okay, we can stay.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.421
My hands are huge.
Why are my hands huge?

15:34.333 --> 15:36.961
Where the fuck am I?

15:37.002 --> 15:39.027
Vince?

15:39.071 --> 15:41.005
Oh no no no no.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.406
No no no no
no no no.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.949
Benji.
Benji.

15:52.985 --> 15:56.011
Benji Benji Benji.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.353
Hey, say it.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.881
Benji Benji.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.827
No no, like this.
Benji Benji.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.831
- Benji Benji.
- It feels nice to say.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.958
Maybe that's a sign.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.060
The script floats.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.798
Maybe that's a sign.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.408
- Should we read it?
- Now?

16:21.447 --> 16:22.675
I couldn't read it now.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.615
Maybe E could read it.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.616
E can't read it.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.625
The answer's not
in that script.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.321
The answer's out there,

16:36.362 --> 16:38.796
Hey!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.731
Ari's still out there.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.256
He's been out there
a while.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.701
Maybe he found
the answer.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.705
I wish he'd come
share it with us.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.764
I don't.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.866
I like us.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.441
We should find him,
though.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.640
I don't want
to go anywhere.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.013
If Vince thinks we have to move,
we have to move.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.950
I don't want to move.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.044
I want to create.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.851
Do you want to move, E?

17:04.890 --> 17:07.085
I want to move.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.228
See you on
the flip side, kid.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.930
Wait up for me.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.768
I'm gonna pee.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.539
I feel cold.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.842
I don't like being cold.
Maybe that's a sign.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.076
Maybe we should keep
a list of possible signs.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.549
E, can you keep a list?

17:36.955 --> 17:38.684
- No!
- Johnny!

17:38.724 --> 17:41.090
What's up?

17:41.126 --> 17:43.424
I thought I pulled
my cock off.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.588
Oh, Jesus!

17:44.630 --> 17:46.495
It's okay.
I didn't.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.329
This way.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.460
Where's Ahnold?

17:53.505 --> 17:55.530
He's right there.
I've been watching him.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.808
That's a rock.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.977
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

18:04.016 --> 18:06.985
- Ahnold!
- Ahnold!

18:07.019 --> 18:08.987
Ahnold!

18:09.188 --> 18:10.951
Vince!

18:10.989 --> 18:13.219
E!
Drama!

18:13.258 --> 18:15.488
Anybody!

18:20.365 --> 18:21.957
Lloyd.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.764
Lloyd.
Lloyd.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.699
Okay okay okay okay.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.640
All right, listen up.
So remember,

18:30.676 --> 18:33.270
the category
is fact or fiction.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.939
I want to buy a vowel.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.210
Oh no.
Everyone, quiet.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.911
- An E.
- Is there an E, Vanna?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.817
Tom, it's Ari.
Shut the hell up.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.587
Hello, Ari. Lily is great.
The house immaculate.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.620
I love the new fabric
on the dining room chairs.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.393
Fabric?
No no no, fabric.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.367
What are you saying?
Oh God, no.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.301
- Ari?
- Lloyd?

18:58.337 --> 18:59.668
Can you hear me, Ari?

18:59.705 --> 19:02.196
Yes, I can hear you.
Am I not hearing you?

19:02.241 --> 19:04.539
I'm freaking out, Lloyd.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.941
No need to.
Everything's fine.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.845
No no, it's not fine, Lloyd.
I am alone,

19:08.881 --> 19:11.611
and I am lost,

19:11.650 --> 19:14.744
and I am hallucinating.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.151
What do you mean?

19:16.188 --> 19:18.053
How long has it been

19:18.090 --> 19:20.524
since I have
seen you, Lloyd?

19:20.559 --> 19:23.687
Can you come
to where I am?

19:23.729 --> 19:25.128
Ari, what is going on?

19:25.164 --> 19:28.190
I have eaten
some mushrooms.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.894
Magic mushrooms?

19:29.935 --> 19:31.664
I hate magic

19:31.703 --> 19:33.967
and magicians, Lloyd.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.440
One time this magician
made my watch appear

19:36.475 --> 19:39.000
in a bottle of beer
and I did not like it.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.171
I don't trust magic, Lloyd.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.807
Oh no, Ari.
You should not hallucinate alone.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.373
Don't be mean, Lloyd.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.544
The first rule of tripping
is stick to the buddy system.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.884
Who is watching you?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.186
I hope no one
is watching me.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.056
The bigger the shoe size
the bigger the cock!

19:56.094 --> 19:58.221
- What was that?
- What was what, Ari?

19:58.263 --> 20:01.528
I thought I heard something.
Was that there or was that here?

20:01.567 --> 20:03.501
It was nowhere.
Don't be paranoid, Ari.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.799
Shut the fuck up!

20:05.837 --> 20:07.566
Now start
from the beginning.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.767
How did you get yourself
in this predicament?

20:17.916 --> 20:19.747
If we could only
find one of them,

20:19.785 --> 20:21.776
Ari or Ahnold,
who would you pick?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.254
You can't ask questions
that can't be answered, Johnny.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.189
I could answer that.
Ahnold.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.693
- Why?
- You can replace an agent.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.354
You can't replace
a best friend.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.125
What if we could have
Ahnold's soul in Ari's body?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.793
Then my agent would have
the soul of a dog

20:35.834 --> 20:37.426
and would want me
to do "Benji."

20:37.469 --> 20:40.336
How do you know Ahnold's
soul even likes Benji?

20:40.372 --> 20:42.135
I don't know.
I just know.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.540
Unless his running
away was a sign.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.806
Write it down, E.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.279
Got anything yet, E?

20:50.616 --> 20:52.174
Why isn't he
saying anything?

20:52.217 --> 20:54.151
You okay, E?

20:56.755 --> 21:00.020
"My mouth won't talk."

21:00.058 --> 21:01.958
Trippy.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.222
Totally.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.288
- Ahnold!
- Ari!

21:07.299 --> 21:09.631
- Ahnold!
- Ari!

21:16.308 --> 21:19.175
When is it
gonna end, Lloyd?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.645
Soon, Ari. Soon.
Do you see anything yet?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.272
Just rocks and dust

21:23.315 --> 21:25.783
and trees and tiny
little goblins.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.786
It's important to remember
what's real and not real, Ari.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.789
You know what, Lloyd?
I've always mocked it,

21:31.823 --> 21:35.088
but now I know it.
You are Confucius.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.493
I think you're becoming
yourself again.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.087
No no no, Confucius...

21:39.131 --> 21:41.122
Confucius say Ari go...

21:41.166 --> 21:43.066
- Ari...
- No no, come on.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.728
Confucius... Con...

21:44.770 --> 21:48.433
Confucius say Ari go...

21:49.841 --> 21:52.674
Confucius say Ari go...

21:52.711 --> 21:56.203
Go where?
You're supposed to say go where.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.485
Something is coming
for me, Lloyd.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.011
No, nothing's coming
for you, Ari.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.717
No no no, I'm serious.
I just heard something.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.453
Ari, just count to five
and you'll see it's just in your head.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.053
- One two three four... it's coming closer.
- Ari?

22:13.131 --> 22:15.156
I'm looking at
two eyes, Lloyd.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.724
Ari, are you sure?

22:16.768 --> 22:19.703
Oh God.
Oh God.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.298
Confucius say, Ari,
you are sure?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.036
- Positive.
- Then run, Ari, run.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.144
Ahnold!
Where are you, boy?

22:30.182 --> 22:33.640
I can make him like me
if I do this.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.649
I like you.
It worked.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.387
Who do you want
to like you?

22:42.427 --> 22:45.294
Everybody already
likes you, Vince.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.663
He who must not be
named does not like me.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.534
I was mean and I didn't
do "Aquaman 2."

22:52.571 --> 22:54.903
And now I can't be
a firefighter.

22:54.940 --> 22:58.569
Why are you so attached to
this "Smokejumpers" thing?

22:58.610 --> 23:02.068
Because E found
the script

23:02.114 --> 23:04.082
and it's good.
And I want to be good.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.108
And I want us to be good
to make up for the bad.

23:07.152 --> 23:10.246
Everyone must know that
E makes Vince good.

23:11.656 --> 23:13.487
You and E really have
something special, Vin.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.016
E is a true friend.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.653
What do I got?

23:17.696 --> 23:19.493
You're a true friend
too, Turtle.

23:19.531 --> 23:22.830
I got no job,
no purpose,

23:22.868 --> 23:25.928
- no dog.
- Oh, Turtle.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.939
I have no E.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.737
E can't talk and it's
really freaking me out!

23:30.776 --> 23:33.108
- I can make E talk.
- I want to call my mom.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.909
Make E talk, Johnny.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.853
Ow!

23:41.887 --> 23:44.788
E, are you back?

23:44.823 --> 23:47.485
Call your mom
in the morning, Turtle.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.922
Okay, E.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.593
You don't want to do
"Benji," Vince.

23:56.535 --> 23:59.095
I want a true sign.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.401
I want to find
Turtle's doggy.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.101
Ahnold!

24:09.314 --> 24:12.078
- Ahnold!
- Drama!

24:12.117 --> 24:14.779
Lloyd, I think
I just heard Drama.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.754
Confucius say
run to him.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.120
Drama!

24:19.157 --> 24:21.318
Drama!

24:21.359 --> 24:22.917
Ahnold?

24:22.961 --> 24:24.622
Ahnold can't talk,
Turtle.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.824
Maybe only I can
understand him.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.628
Drama!

24:28.667 --> 24:31.192
No, I can understand him.
He's talking to Drama.

24:31.236 --> 24:33.261
- Drama!
- That's Ari.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.932
- Ari!
- Ari!

24:34.973 --> 24:37.305
- Ari!
- Something's after me!

24:37.342 --> 24:40.106
Oh my God!
Ahh!

24:40.145 --> 24:43.137
I've never been so fucking
freaked out in my life.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.110
I'm happy!

24:46.151 --> 24:47.618
I'm even happy
to see E.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.210
Thanks, Ari.

24:49.254 --> 24:52.087
It's Ahnold! It's Ahnold!

24:53.258 --> 24:56.022
Where were you, boy?
Where'd you go?

24:56.061 --> 24:58.791
Because I thought I was
never gonna see you again.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.960
- That's it.
- What's what?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.800
Ari.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.305
What, Vinnie?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.138
No no.
Ari, you're it.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.337
Now Vince
is freaking me out.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.346
No, Turtle,
Ahnold found Ari.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.075
Yeah?

25:17.115 --> 25:19.879
And Ari found "Benji"
and they found us.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.386
- E gets it.
- Gets what?

25:25.423 --> 25:27.448
Get's what?
I don't understand what he means.

25:27.492 --> 25:30.620
He means
the Tree has spoken.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.095
We're doing "Benji."

25:53.652 --> 25:55.347
I can't believe you
made these, ER.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.014
You like 'em?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.387
I love them.

25:59.424 --> 26:01.085
You're still tripping.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.957
You're not?

26:02.994 --> 26:04.894
Are you guys?

26:04.930 --> 26:07.831
I don't know.
How do you know when it's over?

26:07.866 --> 26:09.595
It's over.

26:09.634 --> 26:13.092
It might not be.
We might be hallucinating this.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.106
We might not
even be here.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.109
No, we're here.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.439
Is this real or is my wife
calling me at 2:00 AM?

26:22.480 --> 26:25.005
Your wife is calling you
at 2:00 AM.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.382
Hey, baby.
Everything okay?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.387
- Where are you, Ari?
- I'm home, honey.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.184
- Where are you?
- I'm home.

26:31.222 --> 26:34.316
- I went for a jog.
- At 2:00 AM?

26:34.359 --> 26:35.690
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.661
Well, how could you
with 25 men

26:37.696 --> 26:39.425
frolicking naked
in our pool?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.530
Baby...

26:51.209 --> 26:54.474
I don't know who's more dead,
me or fucking Lloyd.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.673
Hey, ER,
I know you hate me,

26:56.715 --> 26:58.649
but is there any way
you could drive really fast?

26:58.683 --> 27:01.083
Not much faster
I can go, Gold.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.555
Something has occurred.
Look.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.155
Holy shit!

27:08.193 --> 27:10.252
Whoa.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.162
You think that's
the victim's girl?

27:13.198 --> 27:14.927
Great rack.

27:36.621 --> 27:40.318
I don't know, guys.
I think I am still tripping.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.724
Snap out of it 'cause I need for you
to come home with me tonight

27:42.761 --> 27:45.127
and do some real acting
for the wife, okay?

27:45.163 --> 27:46.824
Yeah, sure, Ari.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.356
But forget "Benji."
I'm not doing it.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.562
- Really?
- What happened, bro?

27:51.603 --> 27:53.935
I don't know.
Suddenly it just doesn't feel right.

27:53.972 --> 27:57.100
Yeah, well I'm glad you
said it 'cause I couldn't.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.167
So what are you
gonna do now?

27:59.210 --> 28:01.337
Wing it.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.438
I'll get a job.
Help us out.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.041
Turtle's gonna get a job.
If that's not the biggest sign of all.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.279
Listen, you may be dead
as a doornail right now

28:08.319 --> 28:11.550
but we will get you a job before Turtle.
That I'm sure of.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.386
That's great, Ari.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.052
But get me
"Smokejumpers."

28:15.093 --> 28:18.324
Vinnie, I got a better chance
of getting in my house tonight

28:18.363 --> 28:19.694
than you do of getting
in that movie.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.289
Just try, Ari.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.391
I have a feeling
something's gonna change.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.960
Wow, you really are
tripping, huh?
