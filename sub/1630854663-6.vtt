16:26.480 --> 16:28.660
Do what?

16:28.760 --> 16:30.800
Izzy, what did I do?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.420
It's not you. I just need to...

16:34.520 --> 16:35.980
I just need to figure myself out.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.460
What it's the "it's not you, it's me"
kind of thing?

16:39.560 --> 16:40.620
I'm sorry.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
No, don't touch me.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.580
Fuck off.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.300
Yeah.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.600
(SHOUTS) Yeah, why don't you fuck off?

17:09.160 --> 17:12.160
QUINN: Isabel's shoes
are still in the queue.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.500
They're still searching but they
haven't found anything else at Dalkeith.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.580
I really don't think
she was killed at Dalkeith.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.500
The red dirt on her dress tells us
she went somewhere else that night.

17:23.600 --> 17:28.080
Well, the re-examination of her dress
is still on the way, but...

17:30.000 --> 17:32.520
- ..I've got the analysis of her hair.
- Mm-hm?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.880
Um, what's 'wisteria sinensis'?

17:43.200 --> 17:46.500
It is a flower. A Chinese wisteria.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.600
She didn't have any flowers in her hair.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
What? What is it?

17:59.320 --> 18:02.700
- (BEEP!)
- Hi, it's Hazel. Leave a message.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.060
Hey.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.620
I think I know where Izzy went
that night.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
Come to the station.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.260
Are you camping here?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.420
It's where I feel closest to her.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.280
Your grandparents didn't know about us,
so we spent a lot of time here.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.560
- KALANA: It's not even faded!
- Yeah. I touch it up every few years.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.220
Let me get a photo of you,
in next to it.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.320
OK.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.500
Here we go.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.600
Come this way.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.200
(SHUTTER SOUND CLICKS)

18:44.480 --> 18:46.580
It can't be Anton.
He loved Isabel.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.260
Anton doesn't have an alibi
AND Tasha...

18:50.360 --> 18:52.460
said that he wasn't there
when she woke up.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.660
But what's he got to do with
Zeke's cousins?

18:54.760 --> 18:57.780
I think the boys might have been
hiding at Dalkeith

18:57.880 --> 19:00.100
and I think Isabel might have been
helping them.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.420
Anton must have followed them.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.520
And we do know that he does get jealous.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.620
Forensics found wisteria pollen
in Isabel's hair.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.300
I think he took her there.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.660
Does that look familiar at all?

19:13.760 --> 19:16.140
Yeah, I know where this is.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.260
OK.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
Anton and Iz used to go here
when they...

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
..you know, needed time alone.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.880
He took me there too.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.540
Is Anton...

19:33.640 --> 19:35.640
Kal's father?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.820
Yeah.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.300
Wow. You're just telling me this now?

19:40.400 --> 19:44.260
Ugh... OK, OK, OK. Um...

19:44.360 --> 19:45.580
Does Kal know?

19:45.680 --> 19:47.020
No.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.500
But he has been threatening to tell her
ever since the time capsule.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.540
Ugh...

19:50.640 --> 19:53.060
(PHONE RINGS)

19:53.160 --> 19:55.720
Hey, Meg. Kal's phone's off.
Is she with you?

19:56.800 --> 19:58.460
OK, I've got to go.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
What?

20:01.120 --> 20:03.320
Anton picked Kal up after training.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
Show me where this is.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.540
Why would he take Kal there?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.680
Cormack, why would he take Kal there?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.880
(PHONE RINGS)

20:21.920 --> 20:23.660
This is Kal. Leave a message.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.980
Kal, if you get this, call me back, bub.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.080
It's urgent.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.260
You want a beer?

20:32.360 --> 20:33.740
I won't tell your mum.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Thanks.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.580
What did you and Aunty Izzy
used to drink

20:47.680 --> 20:50.140
at parties and stuff?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.500
Uh... Whatever we could
get our hands on.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.060
Izzy didn't drink as much
as the rest of us.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.200
She was smart.
She focused on getting to uni.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.540
You really miss her, don't you?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.640
Yeah.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.760
If you loved her so much...

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
..why did you guys break up?

21:13.920 --> 21:16.200
She realised
I wasn't good enough for her.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
And she was right.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.120
CHLOE: You're such an arsehole.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.900
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:28.000 --> 21:30.260
- And you're such a slut.
- TASHA: Aww...

21:30.360 --> 21:32.420
(LAUGHS) Come on. Let's go back.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.300
Fuck this.
He's not ruining our night.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.680
Come on.
We've still got booze in the van.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.840
(GIRLS CHAT AND LAUGH INDISTINCTLY)

21:59.040 --> 22:01.220
CHLOE: Put these on.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.720
I always get the front
and the back mixed up.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.940
Hey.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.220
To chicks before dicks?

22:13.320 --> 22:16.000
AND to the best road trip ever.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.140
I'm not coming on the trip.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.060
Wait, what?

22:22.160 --> 22:24.160
- I don't want to go anymore.
- Why?

22:25.200 --> 22:26.500
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.460
Did I do something wrong?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.420
I'm just going through
some things, and...

22:31.520 --> 22:33.100
it's just not about you.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.700
Well, it is about me.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.160
It's our trip - you and me.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.460
I gave up Paris for you.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.220
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- It's just what friends do, Izzy.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.340
My dad is the reason
you got that scholarship.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.740
You really think Vic
and the other growers

22:47.840 --> 22:48.940
wanted to give it someone like you?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.660
Your dad doesn't care about me.
He exploits people like me every day.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.180
Ask him about Niman and Kalip.
Ask him what happened to those boys.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.300
What are you talking about?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.500
Your dad's a criminal
and a fucking racist.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.140
What the fuck?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.300
You want the fucking truth?
That's what it is.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.060
- No, that is not the truth!
- It is the fucking truth!

23:03.160 --> 23:05.420
I don't even know
who you are anymore, Izzy!

23:05.520 --> 23:07.460
Get the fuck out.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.560
I don't want you here anymore.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.200
Find your own way home, bitch.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.640
(DOOR CLOSES, ENGINE STARTS)

IZZY: In 2019, I predict that
Ashford will be...

23:24.880 --> 23:28.480
still full of predators
disguised as friends.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.580
I've seen the Ankou here,

23:31.680 --> 23:33.500
sharpening its scythe,

23:33.600 --> 23:35.860
waiting to reap our souls.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.380
There are people here I trusted,

23:38.480 --> 23:40.520
but now I know they feed on suffering.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.180
One day...

23:43.280 --> 23:45.060
when I'm safe from their clutches,

23:45.160 --> 23:48.940
I will expose them and their cruelty.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.620
That's if they don't kill me first.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.460
Do you think you guys
would have gotten back together?

23:54.560 --> 23:57.180
I would have tried, yeah.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.380
But I think I lost her that night.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.480
Even before she...

24:04.200 --> 24:06.100
And my life...

24:06.200 --> 24:08.940
has felt empty since.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.040
Um...

24:13.280 --> 24:15.280
Then you came along.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.600

and you got her brains.

But I... I...

24:42.520 --> 24:44.520
I'm your dad, Kal.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.580
Mum said he was a backpacker
she met at uni.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.180
Yeah, I know.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.760
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.620
I should have told you.
I should have just told you.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.500
- I want to go home.
- Kal, please.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.980
- Just give me a second.
- Take me home.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.700
There's a reason
I couldn't tell you, OK?

25:02.800 --> 25:03.780
About the night Izzy, died.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.180
Izzy brought your mum and I together,

25:05.280 --> 25:07.960

kept me apart from you.

- Anton.
- ..talk for 10 minutes.

- Just talk to us.

OK? And you need to hear it too.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.580
leave them there

42:45.200 --> 42:48.060
After he hit her, he took her boots,

42:48.160 --> 42:50.320

I'd be strong enough
to face him down,

and I put it in the time capsule.
