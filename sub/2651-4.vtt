off his uniform when he was shackled.

grabbed it,
made a lot of fun of me.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.235
- I thought about not going.
- But you did.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.391
Oh, yeah. Had a blast.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.312
Made a lot of friends.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.040
Shared milk shakes with more
than one female tumbler.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.589
The minute I stopped caring
what other people thought...

20:15.680 --> 20:18.320
and started doing what I
wanted to do is the minute...

20:18.400 --> 20:20.790
I finally felt free!

[ Groans ]

20:25.840 --> 20:27.354
Buddy,

20:28.640 --> 20:30.996
you're gonna make
your own choices.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.549
And whatever you decide,
I'll always support you.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.996
You're not just saying all this
'cause you're stuck, right?

20:36.080 --> 20:39.312
Nothing you decide
will ever disappoint me.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.840
Thanks, Dad.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.958
Relax your arms,
roll your shoulders forward,

20:46.040 --> 20:48.396
bend down your head, exhale.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.915
And then arch.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.511
Oh.
Uh, it sort of worked.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.034
[ Sighs ]

21:03.120 --> 21:05.476
Well, honey, I just wanted
to check in and say hi.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.711
Alex, come say hi
to your sister!

21:07.840 --> 21:10.480
I love you so much.
What's up, lady?

21:10.560 --> 21:14.236
Oh, my God. You did not just say, "What's
up, lady?" What's wrong with you?

21:14.320 --> 21:15.913
I was just saying hello.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.117
It's like the lamest thing you've ever said!
And what is that shirt?

21:18.200 --> 21:20.556
- What are you, a flapper?
- I just bought it at that store that you-

21:20.640 --> 21:23.633
Oh, where? Forever 1921? And
what is going on with your hair?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.797
What's wrong with my hair?

21:25.880 --> 21:27.633
Oh, you should just dip yourself
in boy repellant.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.200
Shut up! Mom!

21:29.280 --> 21:31.920
And balance is restored.
