WEBVTT

00:08.882 --> 00:12.334
Get them off! Get them
off of me, please!

00:12.359 --> 00:13.640
Get them off of me!

00:13.666 --> 00:15.532
They're on me! Get them off of me!

00:15.557 --> 00:16.723
Get them off of me!

00:16.748 --> 00:18.084
Robin Charles, early 30s.

00:18.109 --> 00:19.328
Delusional and combative.

00:19.361 --> 00:20.642
Lacerations on the soles of her feet.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.816
- Treatment 6.
- She's on 4 milligrams

00:22.841 --> 00:24.484
of risperidone...
Nothing given in the field.

00:24.508 --> 00:26.387
- Vitals?
- No. Too agitated.

00:26.412 --> 00:27.511
Couldn't get her hooked up.

00:27.536 --> 00:28.695
Get them off of me!

00:29.228 --> 00:32.925
Are we set? On my count.
One, two, three. Gentle.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.076
Robin, do you know where you are?
Do you know who I am?

00:35.100 --> 00:37.073
- Help me! Help me, please!
- We need to sedate her.

00:37.097 --> 00:39.223
5 of olanzapine, 50 of Benadryl.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.955
Shh.

00:40.980 --> 00:42.075
2 of Ativan. 2 of Ativan!

00:46.366 --> 00:50.342
No! No!

00:55.037 --> 00:56.849
Dr. Rhodes?

01:04.825 --> 01:07.428
So, you, um... You
starting to figure out

01:07.453 --> 01:08.587
why I didn't want her
leaving the hospital?

01:08.611 --> 01:09.992
She was rational. She was lucid.

01:10.017 --> 01:11.847
- I warned you.
- Robin was fine, okay?

01:11.872 --> 01:12.640
Suddenly she just...

01:12.665 --> 01:14.700
Suddenly, look at her now!

01:15.457 --> 01:17.424
This is on you.

01:17.449 --> 01:19.120
You did this.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.734 --> 01:47.001
I gave her 5 milligrams of olanzapine,

01:47.026 --> 01:48.716
and she responded well,

01:48.741 --> 01:50.841
so we're gonna titrate up to 10 a day.

01:50.866 --> 01:52.566
Past that, Med isn't the place for her.

01:52.591 --> 01:55.031
Robin belongs in a
long-term locked facility.

01:59.172 --> 02:01.006
Dr. Latham.

02:01.031 --> 02:04.299
Go, Dr. Rhodes.
We'll text you if there's any change.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.043
Go.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.404
Okay.

02:10.275 --> 02:12.060
Thank you.

02:15.950 --> 02:18.185
Daniel...

02:18.280 --> 02:21.318
You should go home and get some rest.

02:25.035 --> 02:27.669
You have to take care of yourself.

02:27.694 --> 02:30.050
Are you taking your meds?

02:31.108 --> 02:35.190
Well, at least go up to
your office and lie down.

02:46.454 --> 02:48.573
You see this?

02:48.598 --> 02:51.565
Mandatory penis examinations.

02:51.691 --> 02:53.408
Under Illinois state law,

02:53.433 --> 02:56.502
all male emergency department
workers are required

02:56.527 --> 03:00.550
to have a yearly penis exam,
to be administered by Dr. Stohl.

03:00.575 --> 03:02.136
Please contact him directly.

03:02.161 --> 03:03.641
Want me to prep you a treatment room?

03:04.843 --> 03:05.875
Graduation week.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.410
Childish pranks,

03:07.435 --> 03:09.198
not to mention the binge drinking

03:09.223 --> 03:10.669
and the stunts!

03:10.731 --> 03:13.231
Every year, we have
an ED full of morons.

03:13.256 --> 03:15.980
Youth, Dr. Stohl.

03:16.005 --> 03:17.872
Yeah.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.531
No. No, there are no exams.

03:20.556 --> 03:22.394
It's a practical joke!

03:22.419 --> 03:24.557
Dr. Shore, Dr. Halstead, don't forget...

03:24.582 --> 03:26.136
Keoni's Luau tonight, my grad party.

03:26.161 --> 03:27.446
- We'll be there.
- Absolutely.

03:27.471 --> 03:28.503
Great.

03:28.528 --> 03:30.055
Mai Tais and poke.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.479
PiÃ±a colada for me.

03:32.915 --> 03:34.748
- See you later.
- Hey.

03:34.773 --> 03:37.784
- You and Nina look happy.
- Yeah.

03:37.809 --> 03:40.710
Hey, you two need to know that...

03:40.837 --> 03:43.371
Robin Charles is in 6.

03:43.396 --> 03:44.644
What happened?

03:44.669 --> 03:46.425
- Psychotic break.
- My God.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.550
You're up. Incoming. Poly trauma.

03:48.575 --> 03:50.667
Go, go, go, go, go.

03:50.692 --> 03:53.050
22-year-old male, peds versus auto.

03:53.075 --> 03:56.363
GCS 12, BP 100/70, heart rate 125.

03:56.435 --> 03:58.896
Got a student ID.
Kid's name is Marwan Haddad.

03:58.921 --> 04:00.762
Hit-and-run.
The car dragged him, like, half a block.

04:00.786 --> 04:02.604
- Sexton, fast his belly.
- On it.

04:02.629 --> 04:04.175
Chest and pelvis.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.200
And left lower leg.
Probably a tib-fib fracture.

04:06.225 --> 04:07.238
Let's move him.

04:07.263 --> 04:09.019
One, two, three.

04:14.451 --> 04:16.493
Poor breath sounds on the left side.

04:17.043 --> 04:19.531
- Christina.
- It's okay. It's okay.

04:19.555 --> 04:21.221
I'm Dr. Manning. This is Dr. Halstead.

04:21.247 --> 04:22.906
We're gonna take really
good care of you, okay?

04:22.908 --> 04:23.993
Christina.

04:24.018 --> 04:25.360
Easy. Easy.

04:25.385 --> 04:27.009
Belly's clear.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.501
He's shocky. I'm intubating.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.469
Bilateral rib fractures.
Bilateral pulmonary contusions.

04:32.494 --> 04:34.899
And hemothorax on the left.
Sexton, chest tube.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.728
Doris, hang two units of
O-neg on the level one.

04:36.752 --> 04:38.073
- Got it.
- We got a medical history?

04:38.097 --> 04:41.172
No. I spoke to his roommate.
Marwan's a Syrian refugee.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.365
He's here to go to school.
That's about all the guy knows.

04:43.389 --> 04:45.290
His parents are on a plane.
They're flying in from Germany

04:45.314 --> 04:48.157
- to go to his graduation.
- Poor guy.

04:49.275 --> 04:52.938
- Chest tube's in.
- Good work.

04:52.965 --> 04:55.996
Can you imagine?
The kid survives cluster bombs in Aleppo

04:56.021 --> 04:58.021
just to come to Chicago
and get hit by a car.

04:58.046 --> 04:59.260
Let me know when he wakes up, all right?

04:59.284 --> 05:00.551
I want to get a statement,
figure out who did this.

05:00.575 --> 05:03.025
- Absolutely.
- Thanks, Jay.

05:08.117 --> 05:09.883
Dr. Rhodes, I have news for you.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.617
I should say "good morning."

05:11.642 --> 05:13.709
- Good morning, Dr. Latham.
- If I'm not mistaken,

05:13.734 --> 05:15.467
you don't seem to be your usual self.

05:15.492 --> 05:17.793
- Tired?
- No. I'm all right. Thanks.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.803
- Okay. Good.
- Did you page me?

05:19.828 --> 05:21.436
Yes. You remember when I told you

05:21.461 --> 05:23.805
that you weren't my first
choice for this fellowship?

05:23.830 --> 05:25.733
- Yeah.
- It was a South African woman

05:25.758 --> 05:26.765
from Groote Schuur.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.224
Well, the hospital has
allowed for another

05:28.248 --> 05:30.195
second-year CT fellow, so she's here,

05:30.220 --> 05:31.429
joining our team.

05:31.454 --> 05:33.954
Dr. Rhodes, meet Dr. Bekker.

05:35.683 --> 05:38.710
- Ava.
- Connor.

05:38.735 --> 05:41.945
I'm sure you two will
enjoy working together.

05:41.970 --> 05:45.476
I'll leave you two to get acquainted.

05:47.927 --> 05:50.312
He's very odd. Asperger's?

05:50.337 --> 05:53.388
Dr. Latham is a great surgeon,
teacher, and friend.

05:53.413 --> 05:57.216
Loyal. That's sweet.

05:57.689 --> 05:59.322
You know what, Dr. Bekker? I'm not sure

05:59.347 --> 06:01.247
we will enjoy working together.

06:05.124 --> 06:07.324
Leah?

06:09.299 --> 06:10.799
Okay.

06:10.824 --> 06:13.114
Mr. Kellogg, I'm the charge nurse.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.439
Is Dr. Charles ready to see me?

06:14.464 --> 06:15.630
I texted him I was coming.

06:15.655 --> 06:16.755
He may not be checking his messages.

06:16.779 --> 06:18.591
He had a family emergency.

06:18.616 --> 06:21.853
He told me that I could see
him any time. He promised.

06:21.878 --> 06:24.679
I'm sorry. But I can have
one of his residents see you.

06:24.704 --> 06:26.594
I'm not talking to some underling.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.865
Is Dr. Charles here?

06:27.890 --> 06:31.278
Yes, but I don't think
he's going to be available.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.622
You tell him that I'm not
gonna be treated this way.

06:33.647 --> 06:36.528
I'm gonna stay right here
and wait until he comes out.

06:36.553 --> 06:37.986
Okay.

06:38.011 --> 06:40.638
Hey, get me a cup of coffee.

06:40.663 --> 06:42.830
The vending machine's right there.

06:47.387 --> 06:49.583
April, about last night...

06:49.585 --> 06:51.441
No. It's just as much my fault.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.330
It never happened.

06:53.489 --> 06:55.549
Dr. Choi, April, you're up.

06:58.038 --> 06:59.405
Cesar?

06:59.430 --> 07:00.966
Don Crocker, 47-year-old male,

07:00.991 --> 07:02.125
shortness of breath, chest pains.

07:02.149 --> 07:03.666
You're going to Treatment 4.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.573
Passed out on the stairs.
Neighbor found him.

07:05.598 --> 07:07.526
Lucky.

07:07.551 --> 07:09.418
Heart rate's at 110.
12 lead in the ambo.

07:09.443 --> 07:11.209
All right, Mr. Crocker, I'm Dr. Choi.

07:11.234 --> 07:13.001
We're gonna take good care of you,
all right?

07:13.026 --> 07:14.698
Okay.

07:14.931 --> 07:18.737
Let's transfer on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

07:24.350 --> 07:26.706
12 lead shows a stemi.
Activate the team.

07:26.731 --> 07:28.995
Mr. Crocker, you're
having a heart attack.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.719
- Aspirin?
- Yeah. 81 milligrams

07:30.744 --> 07:32.344
and 4 of morphine.

07:32.716 --> 07:34.956
Mr. Crocker, is there
anyone we should call?

07:34.981 --> 07:36.213
Friends? Family?

07:36.238 --> 07:38.706
- No.
- Someone at work?

07:38.869 --> 07:42.761
Work from home. Most days
don't even leave the apartment.

07:42.786 --> 07:46.136
- So, no one?
- No.

07:46.903 --> 07:48.851
All right, Mr. Crocker,
you've got fluid backing up

07:48.875 --> 07:49.823
into your heart and lungs...
That's why you're

07:49.848 --> 07:51.370
having difficulty breathing.

07:51.395 --> 07:52.902
April, let's give him
10 milligrams of Lasix

07:52.926 --> 07:54.657
and place a Foley...
We're gonna get the excess water

07:54.681 --> 07:56.013
out of your system.

07:56.038 --> 07:57.581
Okay.

07:57.789 --> 08:00.339
- Mr. Crocker?
- He's lost consciousness.

08:00.364 --> 08:02.683
All right, I've got a pulse.
Take him up to the Cath Lab.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.097
I'll intubate him
there. Page Cardiology.

08:05.122 --> 08:07.522
- Ready?
- Yep.

08:13.507 --> 08:17.261
Why'd she do it? Cut her hair.

08:17.294 --> 08:19.894
A woman changes her hair like that,
it's a big deal, right?

08:19.919 --> 08:21.433
It means something.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.625
Absolutely.

08:23.650 --> 08:25.956
Yeah. So?

08:26.305 --> 08:28.488
Well, don't ask me.

08:31.376 --> 08:33.643
My God. What?

08:33.668 --> 08:35.235
Are you coming to my party tonight?

08:35.260 --> 08:37.092
I don't know. I haven't
thought about it.

08:37.118 --> 08:38.900
Okay.
Well, it won't be the same without you.

08:38.926 --> 08:40.491
All right. Look, I'm busy, okay?

08:40.517 --> 08:43.294
Okay. But you are...

08:43.320 --> 08:45.253
coming to my party.

08:54.335 --> 08:57.227
Hey.

08:57.264 --> 09:00.086
Glad you took my advice.

09:01.082 --> 09:05.547
She's sleeping.
At least let me buy you some breakfast.

09:05.804 --> 09:08.110
Cup of coffee, maybe.

09:17.263 --> 09:19.329
Dr. Charles?

09:19.354 --> 09:21.888
I have been reviewing Robin's history

09:21.913 --> 09:23.550
just to make sure we
haven't missed anything,

09:23.574 --> 09:26.741
and, well, some of her symptoms...

09:26.766 --> 09:30.128
They're not consistent with
a psychiatric disorder.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.496
- Dr. Reese...
- Let her finish.

09:32.936 --> 09:34.869
Two days ago when Robin
came to the hospital,

09:34.894 --> 09:37.285
she was running a mild fever, 100.2,

09:37.310 --> 09:38.843
and her BP was elevated.

09:38.868 --> 09:40.840
Now, at the time,
we didn't think anything of it...

09:40.864 --> 09:42.877
That's 'cause it's a very mild fever.

09:42.902 --> 09:44.582
And of course her BP was elevated.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.036
She was on a forced
hold. She was agitated.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.597
But when Robin was brought in today,

09:47.622 --> 09:50.410
it seemed she was experiencing
visual hallucinations.

09:50.435 --> 09:54.097
Now, auditory hallucinations
indicate a mental disorder,

09:54.122 --> 09:56.169
but visual hallucinations
should be considered organic

09:56.193 --> 09:57.511
until proven otherwise.

09:57.536 --> 09:59.058
I think we all wish that
Robin had a treatable

09:59.082 --> 10:00.877
physical condition rather than...

10:00.902 --> 10:03.308
I want to check her ceruloplasmin levels

10:03.333 --> 10:06.760
and run an FTA-ABS as
well as an MRI and EEG

10:06.785 --> 10:08.691
to rule out scelerosis and epilepsy.

10:08.716 --> 10:11.496
Of course. Do it.

10:14.371 --> 10:16.037
What's the matter with you?

10:16.062 --> 10:17.829
She's trying to make me feel better.

10:17.854 --> 10:19.800
And bless her, but she's
grasping at straws. Come on.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.675
Are you so blinded by your fear

10:21.700 --> 10:23.734
that Robin inherited
her problems from you

10:23.759 --> 10:26.560
that you won't even
entertain an alternative?

10:26.791 --> 10:29.191
False hope, Sharon.
Come on. I don't need any.

10:29.216 --> 10:30.806
You don't know that.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.059
Where's the Daniel who
leaves no stone unturned

10:34.084 --> 10:35.717
when diagnosing a patient?

10:35.912 --> 10:38.813
Where's the Daniel who never gives up?

10:38.838 --> 10:42.306
Don't you think your own
daughter deserves that much?

10:52.859 --> 10:54.360
Thanks.

10:54.385 --> 10:56.996
- Hey, what are we looking at?
- He needs a new valve.

10:57.207 --> 10:59.107
Ava Bekker, CT fellow,

10:59.132 --> 11:01.631
Ethan Choi, Chief Resident of the ED.

11:01.803 --> 11:03.871
So, we crack his chest,
replace the valve.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.944
Well, we don't need to crack his chest.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.403
Mr. Crocker's been assessed
as intermediate risk,

11:08.428 --> 11:11.249
and transcatheter aortic
valve replacement, TAVR,

11:11.274 --> 11:13.725
is now FDA approved for
patients at that level.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.018
We get excellent results with
open aortic valve replacement.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.008
With TAVR,
you're just inviting complications.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.094
I don't agree. Why put the patient

11:20.119 --> 11:22.597
through a long operation
and a long pump run?

11:22.622 --> 11:24.726
He can have a functional heart
again in under two hours.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.717
- The less invasive, the better.
- Exactly.

11:26.742 --> 11:28.468
Excuse me.
You're an emergency medicine resident.

11:28.492 --> 11:30.382
- Why are you even talking?
- Excuse you?

11:30.407 --> 11:32.358
Because I value Dr. Choi's opinion.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.417
And I think you'll find
that Dr. Latham will

11:34.442 --> 11:36.608
back me on the TAVR.

11:36.638 --> 11:38.071
Fine.

11:42.508 --> 11:44.875
I'm sorry you got brought into this.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.935
I didn't know about Robin.
I'm sure you want to be with her.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.190
Yeah, I'm all right, but thanks.

11:48.214 --> 11:49.847
This won't take long.

11:50.123 --> 11:51.993
I'll let you know how he does.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.751
Thanks, man.

11:54.894 --> 11:57.875
- What level of oxygen is he on?
- 100%.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.657
Left upper lobe is
segmentally collapsed.

11:59.682 --> 12:02.139
Probably plugged up from
a clot in his airway.

12:02.673 --> 12:04.839
Yeah. Let's get a bronchoscopy.

12:04.864 --> 12:07.031
Yeah, clear out any obstructions.

12:07.056 --> 12:09.090
Hey, I never asked,

12:09.115 --> 12:11.215
why'd you decide to cut your hair?

12:11.240 --> 12:13.307
Time for a change.

12:20.288 --> 12:22.888
I'm looking for Marwan Haddad.

12:22.913 --> 12:26.037
- Are you family?
- We go to school together.

12:26.062 --> 12:27.983
Well, he's being treated right now.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.175
Why don't you wait in the lobby,
and I'll tell you

12:29.199 --> 12:30.876
when you can see him, okay?

12:34.439 --> 12:36.014
Dr. Choi,

12:36.039 --> 12:37.624
take a look at this girl in 2.

12:37.649 --> 12:40.577
Probable distal radial
fracture and concussion.

12:40.602 --> 12:43.514
This young genius tied
a rope around a rafter

12:43.539 --> 12:45.882
and tried to swing across
the school cafeteria.

12:45.907 --> 12:48.274
- What?
- You'll see.

12:48.299 --> 12:51.114
By the way, I'm
missing my coffee mug.

12:51.139 --> 12:53.356
Yeah, some cretin obviously thought

12:53.381 --> 12:55.482
it would be amusing to steal it.

12:57.901 --> 13:00.435
I'll make sure to look out for it,
Dr. Stohl.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.126
Thank you.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.518
Closed distal radius fracture.

13:09.787 --> 13:12.955
Monkey suit.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.517
Of course. Swinging from the rafters,

13:15.542 --> 13:17.385
- got to have a monkey suit.
- So stupid.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.903
No. You should've seen people's faces

13:19.928 --> 13:20.928
when they saw you.

13:20.964 --> 13:22.594
It was so clutch.

13:22.721 --> 13:25.419
Senior prank.
We're graduating from high school.

13:25.444 --> 13:27.641
We'll need the Ortho
resident to see her.

13:27.695 --> 13:30.782
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
cut this suit to set your arm.

13:30.807 --> 13:33.008
- No! It's a rental.
- I'm sorry.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.861
Your friend lost
consciousness when she fell?

13:34.886 --> 13:36.318
Yeah. I was kind of worried.

13:36.343 --> 13:37.892
Concussion is always a concern.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.782
I want to get a CAT scan, head and neck,

13:39.807 --> 13:41.150
just to be sure.

13:41.175 --> 13:43.375
Don't worry.
You'll be out of here in no time.

13:47.377 --> 13:49.144
I'll call Ortho.

13:51.558 --> 13:55.293
Dr. Choi, you're coming
to my party tonight, right?

13:58.507 --> 14:00.305
Thanks,
but I'm not gonna be able to make it.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.300
Early call tomorrow.

14:03.350 --> 14:06.651
You sure? One Mai Tai.

14:06.739 --> 14:08.372
Sorry.

14:09.346 --> 14:11.513
Okay.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.588
The valve is in position and open.

14:16.613 --> 14:20.083
- Injecting dye now to check it.
- Fluoro.

14:20.501 --> 14:23.296
Left coronary artery looks good,
but I'm not seeing the right.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.615
Could be occluded. Can
you get the wire in?

14:26.659 --> 14:30.560
Let me try and cannulate
the right coronary artery.

14:31.425 --> 14:33.505
Can't, the lumen's blocked.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.665
There's no flow on the right side.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.379
Seeing right side ST changes.

14:37.404 --> 14:38.772
Calcium deposit must have broken off

14:38.796 --> 14:40.696
from the old valve and occluded the RCA.

14:40.721 --> 14:43.599
His heart is dying.
We've got to open him up now.

14:43.629 --> 14:46.636
What we should have
done in the first place.

14:48.843 --> 14:52.075
And we're already making
calls to find her another bed.

14:53.164 --> 14:55.231
We'll keep Robin here until
we can get her transferred

14:55.255 --> 14:56.388
to a long-term facility.

14:56.414 --> 14:57.591
We'll take good care of her.

14:57.616 --> 14:59.774
I've dialed back on her sedation.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.754
Robin? Honey?

15:02.779 --> 15:05.423
Get away from me. Get away.

15:05.448 --> 15:08.255
Get away from me. Get away from me!

15:08.280 --> 15:10.201
Make him go!

15:10.226 --> 15:12.746
Dan, Dan, Dan, we got this.

15:18.842 --> 15:20.475
You were right.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.793
The tests I ran... There's no indication

15:22.818 --> 15:25.021
of any organic medical condition...
I'm sorry.

15:25.218 --> 15:28.590
Robin's showing dyskinesia.
Did you notice that before?

15:28.615 --> 15:30.722
The jerky movements?

15:30.747 --> 15:32.786
Yeah,
I assumed it's from the antipsychotics.

15:32.811 --> 15:34.726
Yeah. It could be.

15:34.751 --> 15:37.354
Did you order a paraneoplastic panel?

15:37.395 --> 15:39.429
For auto-antibodies? Why?

15:39.454 --> 15:42.755
- Could we just run one?
- Of course.

15:50.349 --> 15:54.257
Graft is in place.
Let's get him off of bypass.

15:54.282 --> 15:56.316
Unclamping the aorta.

15:57.858 --> 16:00.826
Let's get his heart beating on its own.
Defibrillate.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.861
Clear. Sinus rhythm.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.349
Cut to 2 liters.

16:11.374 --> 16:13.240
Hold on. His right heart is ballooning.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.633
Back on full support.
Marty, what's he on?

16:15.658 --> 16:17.667
Dobutamine at 8, dopamine at 5.

16:17.692 --> 16:20.489
Give him a milrinone loading dose,
epinephrine bolus

16:20.514 --> 16:22.974
of 50 micrograms, and
start inhaled nitric.

16:22.999 --> 16:25.176
That's not gonna cut it.
His heart isn't coming back.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.021
He's not leaving this room without ECMO.

16:27.046 --> 16:29.213
Won't that just set him up
for complications later?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.457
Why do all the residents
in this hospital

16:31.482 --> 16:33.325
think they can offer their opinions?

16:33.350 --> 16:36.380
No ECMO. His heart is strong
enough to come back on its own.

16:36.630 --> 16:37.583
I disagree.

16:37.608 --> 16:39.608
Noted, but this is my case.

16:43.053 --> 16:45.213
All right, cut to 2 liters.

16:52.202 --> 16:53.768
The heart's coming back.

16:53.793 --> 16:56.160
Septum is midline, SVR acceptable.

16:56.185 --> 16:59.920
- Pressure's holding.
- Good call, Dr. Rhodes.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.246
Yeah.

17:05.271 --> 17:07.238
Let's decannulate.

17:14.957 --> 17:16.957
His sats are down to 80.

17:16.982 --> 17:18.491
There's his latest X-ray.

17:18.516 --> 17:19.714
No improvement.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.473
How much vent support are we giving him?

17:21.838 --> 17:24.339
- Maxed out.
- He's on bronchodilators,

17:24.365 --> 17:25.933
and he's still not
getting enough oxygen.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.151
75%.

17:28.175 --> 17:29.550
If we don't correct his hypoxia,

17:29.575 --> 17:31.208
we're looking at anoxic brain injury.

17:31.233 --> 17:33.674
Let's get him up to the ICU

17:33.699 --> 17:35.339
and put him on cardiopulmonary support.

17:35.364 --> 17:36.964
Right.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.558
Your patient has a friend here.
Girlfriend, maybe.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.776
- Good. I'll go talk to her.
- Okay.

17:42.801 --> 17:44.501
Thanks, Nat.

17:46.353 --> 17:47.797
How long you been waiting?

17:47.822 --> 17:49.555
I don't know... About an hour.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.580
Typical. They lie to you here.

17:51.605 --> 17:53.405
Stand up for your rights.

17:55.321 --> 17:58.355
Hi. Are you Marwan's girlfriend?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.476
Is your name Christina?

18:02.501 --> 18:04.639
Yes.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.119
How do you know my name?

18:08.386 --> 18:11.965
When he first came in,
he called out for you.

18:13.370 --> 18:16.184
Do you know anything that
may help me treat him?

18:16.209 --> 18:18.535
Any medical history? Medications?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.427
We haven't known each other that long.

18:20.452 --> 18:23.257
Okay. We're taking Marwan up
to the Intensive Care Unit.

18:23.282 --> 18:25.488
If you want, you can come wait up there.

18:25.812 --> 18:28.446
All right.
I'll have someone come grab you, okay?

18:30.593 --> 18:31.992
Dr. Stohl,

18:32.017 --> 18:34.759
I... I found your mug.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.751
Where?

18:46.028 --> 18:47.594
Thank you.

18:47.619 --> 18:52.778
I'll, um, call maintenance
to get it down.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.830
Hello?

18:58.222 --> 19:01.323
It's a joke. There are no inspections!

19:01.348 --> 19:02.447
It's a joke!

19:02.472 --> 19:03.972
Get me maintenance.

19:07.361 --> 19:09.561
Here's the paraneoplastic panel.

19:11.460 --> 19:15.628
Wow. Look at that.

19:15.653 --> 19:17.814
You were right, Dr. Reese.

19:18.174 --> 19:20.580
It is objective. It's physical.

19:20.605 --> 19:22.371
Well done.

19:25.446 --> 19:28.390
Where's the tumor?

19:28.698 --> 19:30.664
There.

19:32.552 --> 19:34.519
It's so tiny.

19:37.682 --> 19:39.549
And all that.

19:44.054 --> 19:46.021
Page Dr. Latham.

19:54.158 --> 19:56.279
Good news. Your CT was negative.

19:56.304 --> 19:57.857
You're gonna be fine.

19:57.882 --> 20:00.075
See? I told you!

20:00.100 --> 20:01.966
It isn't that.

20:01.991 --> 20:03.872
She never does anything wrong.

20:03.897 --> 20:05.930
Straight As, all honors.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.655
She got into Harvard.

20:09.484 --> 20:12.451
Well, we'll start the
discharge paperwork.

20:15.359 --> 20:17.141
Parents on their way?

20:17.166 --> 20:20.537
Yes. The school had trouble
getting ahold of them, but yeah.

20:27.163 --> 20:28.762
Hey.

20:30.789 --> 20:34.042
So, what's with you and Dr. Choi?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.995
Nothing. What are you talking about?

20:36.225 --> 20:38.462
Come on, April.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.649
I'm your brother.

20:39.674 --> 20:42.330
No. There's nothing
with me and Dr. Choi.

20:42.355 --> 20:44.009
I... Noah!

20:44.034 --> 20:46.034
I just broke up with Tate.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.116
You think I'm gonna jump
into another relationship?

20:48.141 --> 20:50.405
Maybe Dr. Choi is

20:50.430 --> 20:54.923
no All-Pro football player,
but he is one hell of a doc...

20:55.117 --> 20:58.266
with decent earning potential...
I'm just saying.

21:08.324 --> 21:10.626
- Maggie, where's Robin?
- Let me call you back.

21:10.651 --> 21:13.165
They took her upstairs.
She's getting a scan.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.126
Doctor...

21:17.705 --> 21:20.376
I saw Robin's scheduled for surgery.

21:20.401 --> 21:23.035
She has anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis.

21:23.060 --> 21:26.413
It's very rare.
Dr. Charles had the idea to test for it.

21:26.497 --> 21:29.118
It's some autoimmune response?

21:29.143 --> 21:32.480
Gone awry.
Robin has a mediastinal teratoma...

21:32.505 --> 21:34.975
A benign one,
but her body's attacking the tumor,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.297
and it's also attacking the brain.

21:36.321 --> 21:38.171
Yeah, and the resulting inflammation is

21:38.196 --> 21:39.874
what's caused her psychiatric symptoms.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.046
So, when the tumor's removed?

21:42.071 --> 21:46.371
Hopefully the psychosis
should resolve itself.

21:46.396 --> 21:48.957
Wait. What's going on?

21:48.982 --> 21:50.748
Come on in.

22:01.352 --> 22:03.920
I'll remove the teratoma
via mediastinoscopy,

22:03.945 --> 22:05.556
a minimally invasive procedure.

22:05.581 --> 22:07.648
Shouldn't take more than 90 minutes.

22:11.219 --> 22:13.019
You're gonna be okay.

22:16.925 --> 22:18.891
I love you.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.150
Dr. Latham, I would like to assist.

22:34.175 --> 22:36.953
Absolutely not.
Given your relationship to the patient,

22:36.978 --> 22:39.478
it would be inappropriate
and ill-advised.

22:39.503 --> 22:40.814
I do not want you in my OR.

22:40.839 --> 22:42.181
It would still be your surgery.

22:42.206 --> 22:43.058
I just want to be there.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.917
Dr. Rhodes, my understanding

22:44.942 --> 22:46.655
of human behavior may be limited,

22:46.680 --> 22:48.463
but you are not acting in
the professional manner

22:48.487 --> 22:50.037
that I am accustomed to.

22:50.062 --> 22:51.629
Like any other friend or family member,

22:51.654 --> 22:53.754
you will sit in the waiting room.

22:53.779 --> 22:56.446
Dr. Bekker will assist.

23:08.359 --> 23:11.327
As soon as your parents get here,
you can go.

23:11.573 --> 23:13.473
How can I explain what I did?

23:13.498 --> 23:15.564
I don't even understand it myself.

23:15.589 --> 23:18.323
I do. You got into Harvard.

23:18.358 --> 23:21.706
Sometimes we work so hard,
hold ourselves so tight,

23:21.731 --> 23:25.333
when we finally reach our goal,
we go a little crazy,

23:25.358 --> 23:26.791
swing from the rafters.

23:26.816 --> 23:28.782
I don't know.

23:30.227 --> 23:34.096
Listen to me.
You're gonna go to a fantastic school,

23:34.121 --> 23:37.030
get a great job, and ten years from now,

23:37.055 --> 23:39.455
you'll just think of
this as a happy memory.

23:53.691 --> 23:57.467
Noah says you're
not coming to his party?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.216
I'd really like it if you did.

24:20.247 --> 24:22.591
Should be done soon.

24:30.476 --> 24:33.676
I was wrong to take Robin
out of the hospital.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.189
I'm sorry.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.020
Well,

24:46.583 --> 24:49.684
I have certainly been wrong too.

24:52.206 --> 24:56.008
Seeing the whole thing through
the prism of my own fears.

25:01.204 --> 25:03.537
Since I was a kid, I always wondered

25:03.562 --> 25:06.069
if there was something I could've done

25:06.094 --> 25:09.164
to stop my mom from killing herself.

25:12.744 --> 25:15.414
I obviously couldn't save my mom,

25:15.439 --> 25:20.175
but I was sure as hell
gonna try and save Robin.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.361
You know, at one point I
considered bringing that up.

25:26.386 --> 25:28.226
Decided it probably
wouldn't have been helpful.

25:29.934 --> 25:31.566
Yeah, probably not.

25:35.538 --> 25:37.739
Well,

25:37.764 --> 25:41.209
she's not gonna want to
have anything to do with me

25:41.401 --> 25:44.168
after this is all
over... That's for sure.

25:47.607 --> 25:49.980
Any word?

25:50.005 --> 25:52.050
No, not yet.

25:55.658 --> 25:57.890
Everything okay?

25:59.484 --> 26:02.274
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.805
She did well. The tumor's out.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.239
Now we just have to rid
Robin's body of the antibodies

26:13.264 --> 26:14.655
with plasmapheresis.

26:14.680 --> 26:17.548
Should take two hours,
and hopefully she'll be okay.

26:32.478 --> 26:35.650
Hey, Reese, been looking for you.

26:35.675 --> 26:38.806
I thought you might want this back.

26:40.407 --> 26:42.738
It was a gift. Why would I want it back?

26:42.763 --> 26:46.131
You know, when people break up,
you give stuff back.

26:49.109 --> 26:52.747
It's a Rubik's cube, Joey.
Not a diamond ring.

26:52.772 --> 26:54.506
Keep it.

26:55.753 --> 26:57.720
One more thing.

27:00.442 --> 27:04.861
I'm dating Valerie.
I just thought you should know.

27:07.901 --> 27:09.901
I'm glad you found someone.

27:09.926 --> 27:11.826
Thanks.

27:32.793 --> 27:34.326
Christina?

27:34.351 --> 27:35.940
How are you doing?

27:38.991 --> 27:42.370
We are doing everything
we can for Marwan.

27:42.884 --> 27:45.527
I'm pregnant.

27:45.996 --> 27:47.432
We didn't mean it to happen.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.409
We thought we were being careful.

27:50.099 --> 27:53.432
We were going to get
married after graduation.

27:53.914 --> 27:56.018
Nobody knows.

27:56.043 --> 27:58.339
You haven't told your families?

27:58.431 --> 28:01.299
We were going to tell
his parents tonight.

28:03.423 --> 28:06.724
I am so sorry you both
have to suffer like this.

28:26.366 --> 28:28.265
Dr. Choi?

28:28.290 --> 28:30.491
Mr. Crocker.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.316
They did have to open your chest,

28:32.341 --> 28:35.207
but you came through just fine.

28:35.472 --> 28:38.273
- Thank you.
- Sure.

28:38.376 --> 28:40.316
For... for caring.

28:48.297 --> 28:50.663
- Hey.
- Hey. How's Robin?

28:50.871 --> 28:53.805
She's good. Thanks. You saw Mr. Crocker?

28:53.830 --> 28:56.574
Yeah. Pretty young to have
that kind of heart trouble.

28:56.599 --> 28:59.194
Could be genetics, or...

28:59.646 --> 29:01.279
He said he's alone, right?

29:01.304 --> 29:02.680
He's not married. No friends. No family.

29:02.704 --> 29:04.249
- No.
- Loneliness puts you at risk

29:04.274 --> 29:06.841
for heart disease. That for real?

29:06.926 --> 29:09.054
Yeah. I think we all know
that love can hurt, right?

29:09.079 --> 29:12.571
But loneliness... That'll kill you.

29:19.686 --> 29:21.486
What is it, Natalie?

29:21.511 --> 29:23.678
Look at his X-rays.

29:23.703 --> 29:25.436
Diffuse airway disease.

29:25.461 --> 29:28.596
Even with CPS, his lungs
are getting worse. Fast.

29:28.621 --> 29:30.107
This poor kid.

29:30.131 --> 29:33.552
What, his parents just
flying here to bury him?

29:34.458 --> 29:36.716
Why can we not figure out
what's wrong with him?

29:36.998 --> 29:39.731
We've been so focused on his injuries.

29:39.756 --> 29:41.465
Maybe there's an underlying condition

29:41.490 --> 29:42.825
not related to the accident

29:42.850 --> 29:45.044
that we don't know about.

29:45.686 --> 29:47.624
When Marwan got his bronchoscopy,

29:47.649 --> 29:49.350
his tidal volume dipped...
It shouldn't have.

29:49.374 --> 29:51.174
Right. The paralytics should've

29:51.199 --> 29:52.832
relaxed his chest wall,

29:52.857 --> 29:55.544
so why are his airways
still so constricted?

29:55.569 --> 29:57.135
Why can't he breathe?

29:57.160 --> 30:01.747
What if it's as simple
as Marwan's got asthma?

30:01.942 --> 30:05.518
That would make sense.
He needs steroids.

30:05.712 --> 30:08.165
Natalie, if we're wrong,
that'll put him at risk

30:08.190 --> 30:09.276
for infection and myopathy,

30:09.301 --> 30:10.653
and that could wind up killing him.

30:10.677 --> 30:12.076
Well, we are out of options.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.995
If we don't do something
now, he will die.

30:22.422 --> 30:26.314
Candace, 125 milligrams
of Solu-Medrol IV.

30:34.735 --> 30:37.616
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning?
The patient's parents are here.

30:37.641 --> 30:39.273
They just arrived.

30:39.298 --> 30:40.764
Great.

30:42.844 --> 30:44.477
- Hi.
- Hello.

30:44.502 --> 30:46.184
Thank you for taking care of him.

30:46.209 --> 30:47.981
How is he?

30:48.006 --> 30:51.874
He was seriously injured,
and our main focus right now is

30:51.899 --> 30:53.258
his lung function.

30:53.283 --> 30:56.017
Is Marwan by
any chance asthmatic?

30:56.114 --> 30:58.781
Yes, yes, since he was a child.

30:58.806 --> 31:00.820
It comes and goes.

31:01.065 --> 31:04.992
- His X-ray is ready.
- Please, come with us.

31:13.284 --> 31:15.368
My God.

31:15.393 --> 31:18.018
Bilateral consolidation's
markedly improved.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.843
His airway pressures are coming down.

31:19.868 --> 31:22.201
- What does that mean?
- It means

31:22.226 --> 31:23.777
we think your son's gonna be all right.

31:23.801 --> 31:26.089
Thank you.

31:27.645 --> 31:31.619
Candace, let's start weaning
him off cardiopulmonary support.

31:31.644 --> 31:33.544
You can stay with your son.

31:39.729 --> 31:41.845
Marwan's recovering.

31:42.838 --> 31:45.590
You should go introduce yourself.

31:46.864 --> 31:49.246
I don't know.

31:49.271 --> 31:51.925
They should know who you are.

32:10.646 --> 32:13.414
Are you good?

32:13.439 --> 32:14.905
Yeah.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.334
Some days, I really love my job.

32:54.467 --> 32:56.567
Asthma. Astute diagnosis, doc.

32:56.592 --> 32:57.874
Hey, don't give me all the credit.

32:57.898 --> 32:59.610
I wouldn't have gotten
there if it wasn't for you.

32:59.634 --> 33:01.534
You're the genius.

33:01.559 --> 33:03.682
Marwan's awake. I got
a statement from him.

33:03.706 --> 33:06.467
- Great. I'll go check on him.
- Thanks, Nat.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.382
So, it's Noah's
graduation party tonight.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.100
- Yeah. Should be fun.
- Yeah.

33:14.316 --> 33:16.917
Natalie asked me to go with her.

33:16.942 --> 33:18.875
You mind?

33:20.855 --> 33:23.373
No. Of course not.

33:28.202 --> 33:30.384
You sure?

33:32.065 --> 33:33.798
Yeah.

33:37.055 --> 33:40.061
All right, you know,
I'll tell her I pass.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.186
You need to get your act together.

33:56.946 --> 33:59.487
- Hey.
- Is it time to go?

34:00.943 --> 34:05.260
Nina? I haven't been fair to you.

34:06.455 --> 34:09.848
You deserve someone as committed
to you as you are to him,

34:09.873 --> 34:12.139
and I haven't been that person.

34:14.070 --> 34:16.170
This is about Natalie, isn't it?

34:18.954 --> 34:21.655
You lied to me.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.746
You said there was nothing between you.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.773
I don't know if she has feelings for me,

34:27.797 --> 34:32.266
but I have feelings for her,
and I can't go on pretending.

34:32.292 --> 34:36.161
All this time? Pretending?

34:36.472 --> 34:38.103
Nina, I care about you...

34:38.128 --> 34:39.808
Get out of here, Will.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.599
Go!

34:48.710 --> 34:51.425
I'll get my stuff out of your apartment.

34:51.449 --> 34:53.283
Sooner the better.

35:14.432 --> 35:17.318
There are balloons in my office.

35:17.775 --> 35:19.742
Hundreds of them. I can't get in.

35:19.767 --> 35:23.135
I'll call housekeeping.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.126
Maggie...

35:27.446 --> 35:29.185
Do people hate me?

35:29.210 --> 35:31.334
No, Dr. Stohl.

35:31.359 --> 35:32.732
It's quite the reverse.

35:32.757 --> 35:34.677
Then why?

35:35.158 --> 35:36.958
You know the saying:

35:36.983 --> 35:39.317
"You only hurt the ones you love."

35:51.585 --> 35:53.506
A tumor?

35:53.531 --> 35:55.795
Yeah.

35:56.219 --> 35:58.019
Reaction to your antibodies

35:58.044 --> 36:00.445
caused your psychiatric symptoms.

36:03.075 --> 36:05.242
So, I was crazy,

36:05.267 --> 36:07.134
but I wasn't crazy?

36:07.159 --> 36:09.425
Yeah, something like that.

36:09.450 --> 36:10.883
Okay.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.509
You should know something.

36:19.534 --> 36:23.102
It was your dad that came
up with the diagnosis.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.450
Robin, he's hardly left your side.

36:28.475 --> 36:30.441
You should talk to him.

37:05.039 --> 37:07.592
Hi, sweetie.

37:17.864 --> 37:19.831
Honey.

37:21.067 --> 37:25.957
Robin, I... I...

37:45.836 --> 37:49.337
So, I think we can call today a draw.

37:49.743 --> 37:52.062
Didn't realize we were in a competition.

37:52.087 --> 37:53.886
Come on.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.072
You know, you're quite
the gossip magnet.

37:57.097 --> 37:59.164
Your mother committed suicide,

37:59.189 --> 38:00.751
you drove your girlfriend crazy,

38:00.776 --> 38:04.001
and you murdered your
attending, Dr. Downey.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.034
Well, then, you'd better watch yourself,
hadn't you?

38:12.622 --> 38:15.342
I like dangerous men.

38:46.901 --> 38:49.435
I want you.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.312
Come on.

39:56.911 --> 39:58.911
April.

39:58.936 --> 40:01.598
Dr. Choi.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.342
Ethan.

40:31.934 --> 40:35.769
- You're still here?
- Five minutes, and I'm gone.

40:36.841 --> 40:38.740
It's so good to hear about Robin.

40:38.765 --> 40:40.532
Yeah.

40:40.557 --> 40:42.769
Well, we made it through another year,
Daniel.

40:42.793 --> 40:46.242
Gonna get a new bunch of
residents to drive us crazy.

40:46.267 --> 40:48.100
Le plus ca change, baby.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.693
Le plus ca change.

40:50.718 --> 40:52.084
Good night, Sharon.

40:52.109 --> 40:54.008
Good night.

41:02.565 --> 41:05.057
Dr. Charles.

41:06.104 --> 41:07.486
Mr. Kellogg?

41:07.511 --> 41:08.870
I've been waiting here all day.

41:08.895 --> 41:10.877
You haven't answered any of my messages.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.936
I'm very sorry. I've had a...

41:13.003 --> 41:15.003
An unusual day.

41:15.028 --> 41:15.924
Is there any way we could talk
first thing in the morning?

41:15.949 --> 41:17.015
Liar!
