00:05.088 --> 00:06.180
Good morning.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.557
Morning.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.309
Mr. Selfridge,
can I get anything

00:09.468 --> 00:10.640
for you and your guest?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.349
Coffee-- a pot.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.436
Mr. Dillon and I have been
putting the hours in.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.020
We just shook hands
on Whiteley's.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.151
You're looking
at the youngest

00:18.310 --> 00:20.278
department store owner
in London.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.064
That is quite an achievement.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.153
Thank you, sir.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.371
I could barely get past the door
three months ago.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.080
The English aren't immune
to a whiff of fortune,

00:33.242 --> 00:35.244
which is fortunate for those
of us who lack a title.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.754
I don't have any more than
I had yesterday.

00:37.913 --> 00:41.133
In fact, I...
I have nothing left now.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.010
I've spent the whole of my life
like that.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.967
I put everything
into the next project.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.472
That's what I did
with Selfridge's,

00:47.631 --> 00:49.759
and that's how I'm gonna
turn around Whiteley's.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.552
Fortune favors the brave.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.102
Just a moment.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.063
Hello, Mr. Selfridge.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.477
Hello.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.520
I'm going to be announcing
my purchase of Whiteley's.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.563
A big launch.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.606
I'd love for you to come.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.319
My pleasure.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.950
Great.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.911
Thank you.

01:57.075 --> 01:57.951
Morning, Arthur.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.415
Morning, Roger.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.704
Is everything all right?

02:00.871 --> 02:04.045
Well, I haven't spoken to him
about it yet,

02:04.207 --> 02:08.633
but I'm going to talk
to the chief about retiring.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.389
The place won't be the same
without you.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.142
It's the end of an era.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.224
Oh, I...

02:16.386 --> 02:18.855
I know what you meant,
dear friend.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.692
Mr. Dillon's accountants
look like children.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.608
About as young <i>as</i> we were
when we started out.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.493
I was never that young.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.246
Okay Harry, we've been through
the financial reports

02:35.405 --> 02:36.452
on Whiteley's
and we are good to go.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.662
We can get the contracts
drawn up

02:37.824 --> 02:39.167
<i>as soon as tomorrow.</i>

02:39.326 --> 02:40.748
I must advise you
it's a tight turnaround.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.629
All I need to know is
whether the company is solvent.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.664
Yes, it is.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.127
Well then, I'm happy.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.633
Well, I'm...

02:46.792 --> 02:49.966
Gordon, trust me, we know enough
to go through with this.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.803
I was merely going to say,
"I'm with you, Pa."

02:53.965 --> 02:54.841
Great.

02:55.008 --> 02:55.930
Excuse me.

02:59.846 --> 03:00.768
Ah, chief!

03:00.931 --> 03:03.059
This is a big day for you,
Mr. Gordon.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.101
I'm so pleased you
and your father

03:04.267 --> 03:05.484
are going into business.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.648
If I can be of any assistance,
do not hesitate to ask.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.033
I'd be more than willing
to help with any business plan.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.238
We have everything
under control.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.277
Thank you, though.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.365
Thank you.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.119
Marvelous.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.789
I know you want
this deal done quickly,

03:21.952 --> 03:25.172
but we haven't had enough time
to do a full assessment.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.048
There is a problem
with some of the suppliers.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.584
There are some bills
outstanding.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.922
No, no, no,
we don't have time for that.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.177
I've worked
with Harry Selfridge--

03:31.336 --> 03:32.337
he can do anything.

03:32.504 --> 03:33.847
Now, let's get on with it.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.972
Miss Grove, can I help you?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.062
I was looking
for Miss Brockless.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.441
I don't see how

03:45.600 --> 03:47.773
Miss Brockless' whereabouts
are any of your concern.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.326
Well, she wasn't here
yesterday, either.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.736
Is she ill?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.200
Miss Brockless is no longer
employed by Selfridge's.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.206
What?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.992
You heard.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.287
Now back to Fashion,
where you belong.

04:04.453 --> 04:09.300
You've overstepped yourself.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.428
You wait till my father
hears about this.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.509
I think you should speak
to your father.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.423
After all, he's the one
who dismissed her

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
in the first place.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.106
Father.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.941
Meryl, what on earth
are you doing up here?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.980
This is senior
management only.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.899
Is it true?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.908
You gave Tilly notice?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.660
Tilly?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.366
Miss Brockless.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.997
Oh.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.409
I... I did.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.169
How could you?

04:46.328 --> 04:49.172
Meryl, I do not have the energy
for one of your tantrums.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.833
I don't want to fight.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.127
I just want to know why.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.215
Sit down.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.972
It seems Miss Brockless
was let go

05:05.138 --> 05:08.438
by her previous employer
due to inappropriate behavior.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.729
What inappropriate behavior?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.522
The term they used was
"scandalous."

05:16.441 --> 05:18.409
I gave Miss Brockless
every opportunity

05:18.568 --> 05:19.785
to defend her reputation,

05:19.945 --> 05:22.573
but she wouldn't,
or couldn't.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.616
So you just sacked her?

05:24.783 --> 05:26.376
I think it best
we put this matter behind us.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.004
She's my friend.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.961
She was decent and fair,

05:32.123 --> 05:35.172
which is more than I can say
about you.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.873
This isn't simply
a business acquisition.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.289
This is two great dynasties
coming together

06:12.455 --> 06:14.423
in a historic union

06:14.583 --> 06:16.961
in order to provide
the best possible service

06:17.127 --> 06:19.596
to customers around the world.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.303
(applause)

06:24.801 --> 06:28.226
(flashbulbs popping)

06:39.190 --> 06:41.534
Surely, you don't expect us
to actually turn up

06:41.693 --> 06:43.240
and work for you?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.825
No, you've done
enough damage already.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.285
Your father will be turning
in his grave.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.702
Mr. Selfridge,
will you be renaming Whiteley's?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.997
There is only one
Selfridge's.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.416
Mr. Dillon, will it be business
as usual at Whiteley's?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.505
It's going to be business
and more!

06:57.667 --> 06:58.714
A business reborn.

06:58.877 --> 07:03.098
(applause)

07:03.256 --> 07:04.508
(flashbulbs popping)

07:10.555 --> 07:12.228
I couldn't be
more proud of you, son.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.687
Thank you, Mother.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.976
It feels like
a new beginning.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.110
It is.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.316
Big day for you,
Mr. Dillon.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.197
A step up
from your little trusts.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.576
Those little trusts made
a lot of people a lot of money,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.202
and they're not
the only string to my bow.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.363
Oh, that's right,
you and Victor Colleano

07:26.529 --> 07:27.746
promoted that boxing match,
didn't you?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.034
Do much business with Colleano
before he died?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.326
Not a lot, no.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.497
Why? Did you fall out?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.667
Why on earth would you be
interested in Victor Colleano?

07:37.832 --> 07:40.005
I'm investigating
his death.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.263
They say Victor had made a lot
of enemies by the time he died.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.219
I wondered
if you were one of them.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.134
What are you insinuating?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.347
No, no, no, come on,
what are you insinuating?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.688
Everyone knows Victor consorted
with gamblers and criminals.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.067
That's where you
should be looking.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.353
Calm down, son,
I was only asking.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.396
Well, ask somebody else.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.741
Calm down, Jimmy.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.406
You're walking yourself
to the gallows.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.367
I can handle men like him.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.269
♪♪

08:37.851 --> 08:39.193
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Mr. Crabb,

08:39.352 --> 08:40.854
but aren't those documents
confidential?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.238
I was merely...

08:42.397 --> 08:43.693
That is, I was...

08:43.857 --> 08:45.985
(Sighs)

08:46.151 --> 08:47.448
Guilty as charged.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.615
I'm just used to looking
after the chief's interests.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.283
Feeling a little left out,
are we?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.708
Come on, now.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.634
You just have to accept
that the chief operates

09:06.796 --> 09:08.548
in a wider world
that we have no part in.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.274
Perhaps you'd like to explain

09:18.433 --> 09:20.231
what the Whiteley's
floor plans are doing

09:20.393 --> 09:22.236
spread out
on your desk?

09:23.980 --> 09:24.981
Hm?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.850
What are you...?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.314
Go away, Meryl.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.195
I just want to talk to you.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.400
Stay here.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.464
Is she yours?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.225
Who else's would she be?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.892
I take it
this is the reason

10:38.054 --> 10:41.024
why you lost
your previous position?

10:42.851 --> 10:45.354
You don't know anything
about me.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.899
So put me right.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.822
(knocking)

10:55.280 --> 10:56.372
Ah, Mr. Crabb.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.124
What can I do for you?

11:00.952 --> 11:03.000
Mr. Selfridge,
I have a confession to make.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.966
I've taken the liberty
of reading the documents

11:07.125 --> 11:08.422
to support the purchase
of Whiteley's.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.630
That's my personal business,
Mr. Crabb.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.423
That's a serious offense.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.137
Oh, I...

11:15.300 --> 11:16.677
I feel terrible,
I promise you.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.687
I'm teasing you, Mr. Crabb.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.565
Oh, very droll.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.771
(chuckling)

11:23.933 --> 11:25.310
Whiteley's accounts are,

11:25.476 --> 11:27.103
to be frank, a mess.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.489
I had to fire
their chief accountant--

11:29.647 --> 11:31.194
one of Whiteley's old boys.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.405
It's quiet here at the moment.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.321
I'd be happy
to pop over to Bayswater

11:36.487 --> 11:38.785
and see if I couldn't impose
a little order on the chaos.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.700
I'm not sure what
the Selfridge's board

11:40.867 --> 11:42.039
would say about that.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.751
Well, I won’t tell them
if you won't.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.836
Thank you, Mr. Crabb.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.717
I would appreciate that.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.317
(clears throat)

12:11.981 --> 12:13.153
Yes?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.112
Arthur Crabb.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.151
I'm from Selfridge's.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.535
I did call.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.788
Yes, good afternoon.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.494
I wonder if you'd be so good

12:20.657 --> 12:23.877
as to point me in the direction
of the accounts department.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.787
Of course.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.354
Is there anything
I can do to help?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.644
A cup of tea, please.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.187
A strong one.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.767
Can I help you, Mr. Towler?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.644
No, sir.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.271
I'm fine.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.352
Jolly good.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.574
(knocking)

13:40.737 --> 13:41.863
Please don't lock up,
I'm still here.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.830
Please don't lock up,
I'm still here.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.663
Mildred!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.797
If the mountain
won't come to Mohammed...

13:53.958 --> 13:56.802
It's only
a cold collation.

13:56.961 --> 14:02.138
A little ham, beef,
tomatoes from the greenhouse.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.763
Look at you,
all alone in the dark.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.023
Haven't you done enough
for Harry Selfridge?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.934
It's become a bit of a habit.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.102
I don't seem to be able
to stop myself.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.739
You're too good to him,
I've always said.

14:16.898 --> 14:17.774
Oh!

14:17.940 --> 14:18.862
(sniffs)

14:19.025 --> 14:21.448
And you're too good to me.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.118
Here, have some tea.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.871
Oh! Arthur, I'm so sorry.

14:28.034 --> 14:28.910
It's no matter.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.921
You couldn't possibly make it
any more chaotic.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.180
Is something the matter?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.155
(clears throat)

15:08.825 --> 15:09.997
You were late home
yesterday, Meryl.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.038
Is Fashion
keeping you busy?

15:13.204 --> 15:16.174
I visited
Miss Brockless.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.458
Oh, and how is Tilly?

15:19.377 --> 15:22.005
Pretty desperate,

15:22.171 --> 15:25.641
which is understandable,
seeing as Father sacked her.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.393
What?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.519
Well, when did this happen?

15:28.678 --> 15:30.271
I don't think this is
appropriate conversation

15:30.430 --> 15:31.431
for the breakfast table.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.564
Particularly not
in front of the children.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.226
I don't mind.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.645
She had a baby out of wedlock.

15:36.811 --> 15:37.812
Did she?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.652
Did you really expect her
to talk to you about that?

15:39.814 --> 15:41.566
I was thinking
of the reputation of the store.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.450
What's Selfridge's
got to do with it?

15:43.609 --> 15:44.610
Work's been hell for her

15:44.777 --> 15:45.949
thanks to Miss Ellis.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.581
Tilly told me she was
engaged to the father.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.992
When his parents found out,

15:51.159 --> 15:53.457
they packed him up
and shipped him off.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.836
It was only afterwards

15:54.996 --> 15:57.169
she realized
she was pregnant.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.592
You and I can hardly judge.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.887
That was different.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.437
What was different?

16:12.597 --> 16:14.850
That's quite enough, Ernest.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.566
I didn't do anything!

16:28.196 --> 16:29.493
I'm sorry.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.408
I should never have said that
in front of your children.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.543
I have to go to work.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.878
I thought you said
you were going to retire?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.508
I've been at Selfridge's
for 30 years.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.384
I can't just walk away
in a day.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.137
Have you told
Mr. Selfridge yet?

16:45.296 --> 16:48.095
Not yet, but <i>I</i> will.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.857
I'm beginning to get a grip
on the situation,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.694
but I'm afraid
it's not good news.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.358
Several of the suppliers
are refusing to do business

17:06.526 --> 17:09.655
until a series of outstanding
debts have been met.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.573
What the hell have those
Whiteley brothers been up to?

17:12.740 --> 17:15.584
Mr. Crabb, I need you
to contact those suppliers

17:15.742 --> 17:17.711
and get them
to extend our credit.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.669
Let them know that Whiteley's
is under new ownership.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.253
I've already tried, Chief,
but they won't be moved.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.634
What, all of them?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.046
I'm afraid so.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.839
The fact that
you're new owners

17:28.005 --> 17:29.928
only makes them believe
there are new resources.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.185
They'll only accept
cash payment.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.437
They want their
balance sheets cleared.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.063
That's ridiculous.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.724
I'm surprised
the accountants

17:37.890 --> 17:39.608
didn't bring this
to your attention.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.198
We need to find out
the state of our store.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.346
Right, what about
the other stock rooms?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.310
This room directly feeds
the store.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.099
It would be the last
to fall this empty.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.234
He's right--
we're almost out of stock.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.316
I don't have
any more money for this.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.480
So what's the answer?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.695
I've used up all
of my contingency.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.111
None of us have
spare cash.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.325
And if we can't
get credit,

18:33.487 --> 18:35.034
then we can't get stock.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.165
No stock, and we're
out of business.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.793
We'll find a way
to solve this.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.543
Good morning,
Madame Rennard.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.177
Miss Ellis.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.838
I wonder, could you furnish me
with Tilly Brockless's address?

18:49.837 --> 18:53.057
I wonder, could you furnish me
with Tilly Brockless's address?

18:53.215 --> 18:55.058
I'm not sure I hold it.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.345
It'll be in the staff ledger--
it's right behind you.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.390
I just need it so that
I can reinstate her.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.278
So, you're happy for some girls

19:06.437 --> 19:07.689
to get special treatment,
are you?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.654
It seems to me that you
and your girls

19:10.816 --> 19:13.160
have been giving Miss Brockless
very special treatment.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.947
Miss Brockless did not fit.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.411
If you insist on overruling me
on this matter,

19:18.574 --> 19:20.167
then I'll have to consider
my position.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.543
Very well, I accept.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.955
What?

19:24.121 --> 19:25.714
Unless I'm very much mistaken,

19:25.873 --> 19:27.466
you just tendered
your resignation.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.343
That's certainly
what I heard.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.845
I've done nothing wrong.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.927
Then you'll know how it feels.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.502
Keep your head down.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.163
I never did nothing--
it was all you.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.797
Oh, really?
Yes!

20:07.998 --> 20:09.375
Mr. Grove...

20:09.542 --> 20:10.919
Gosh are you quite well?

20:11.085 --> 20:12.678
(groans)

20:12.837 --> 20:16.512
No, it was my daughter
that discovered Miss Brockless

20:16.674 --> 20:18.051
had been a victim
of a bullying campaign.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.847
It's my duty to put
the situation right.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.561
Well, I'm sorry,
but you don't look to be

20:24.724 --> 20:26.522
in a fit state
to be going anywhere.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.437
I know Miss Brockless-
why don't I go and see her?

20:31.439 --> 20:32.406
Thank you.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.327
Meryl was only standing up
for what is right.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.907
I would hate to let
my daughter down.

20:38.070 --> 20:42.166
I'm sure I can persuade her
to return.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.201
Thank you.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.838
Fourth floor, please.

21:14.732 --> 21:15.824
(elevator dings)

21:17.902 --> 21:19.370
Thank you.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.432
(Sighs)

21:44.678 --> 21:45.600
(groans)

21:57.483 --> 21:58.405
Mrs. Grove!

21:59.652 --> 22:00.528
Oh!

22:00.694 --> 22:01.911
How are you?

22:02.071 --> 22:03.323
I'm quiet all right.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.706
I just had a bit of a turn.

22:04.865 --> 22:05.741
He collapsed.

22:05.908 --> 22:06.784
What?

22:06.951 --> 22:09.579
I'm feeling much better.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.621
Thank you.

22:10.788 --> 22:11.880
Roger!

22:12.039 --> 22:12.961
Thank you,
Miss Plunkett.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.254
Roger, what's going on?

22:18.420 --> 22:22.641
I think I've been leaning
a little too heavily

22:22.800 --> 22:24.427
on my medication.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.140
Well, how much
have you been taking?

22:27.888 --> 22:31.142
Well, I needed
to finish my work.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.231
But you said
you wanted to retire.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.567
I did.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.322
And then the chief
bought Whiteley's

22:37.481 --> 22:39.575
and I saw him starting
a new chapter,

22:39.733 --> 22:42.737
and I confess, I wanted
to be a part of it.

22:45.656 --> 22:51.584
So, I've been devising
a business plan.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.339
It's stupid, I know.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.216
I should never go there.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.797
But...

23:00.462 --> 23:03.682
it made me feel like
I had a future too.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.563
It's ridiculous.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.224
I shall retire today.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.819
Has Mr. Selfridge seen this?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.904
Mrs. Grove, I don't think
we have enough time for this.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.364
Please, Mr. Selfridge,
just two minutes.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.655
Mr. Grove has been working
on a business plan

23:25.821 --> 23:27.243
to reinvigorate
Whiteley's.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.623
I think you should
take a look.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.704
Thank you.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.551
Chief.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.382
So, the first thing
I'd change

23:44.548 --> 23:46.926
is the layout of the store.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.719
It's an elementary mistake

23:48.886 --> 23:50.513
to lead in with menswear,
as we know.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.896
We've known for years
it's the women

23:52.056 --> 23:53.103
who lead their husbands
into a store,

23:53.265 --> 23:54.187
not the other way around.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.273
(laughs)

23:56.435 --> 23:59.689
So, by rearranging Perfume,
Cosmetics, and Stationery,

23:59.855 --> 24:04.281
we can place Accessories
on the floor,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.787
and then this area,
which is completely unused,

24:06.946 --> 24:09.369
could be for cross-promotion
display.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.954
So you have four departments
on the ground floor

24:12.117 --> 24:13.460
as opposed
to the current three.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.996
Very impressive.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.914
We could single
some departments out

24:17.081 --> 24:19.630
for a daily sales review.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.294
Perhaps Perfume?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.258
Accessories has the broadest
range of suppliers.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.467
It could provide
the fastest picture

24:24.630 --> 24:26.473
of the relationships
throughout the store.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.930
I have to say, I wish you all
worked for Whiteley's.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.345
Fantastic.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.354
With all you
by my side,

24:32.513 --> 24:34.857
l feel like
I could do anything.

24:36.558 --> 24:40.654
Actually, my wife
is insisting that I retire.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.692
She's right.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.861
It's high time
I started to slow down.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.529
That's such a shame,
Mr. Grove.

24:48.696 --> 24:49.822
You'll be sorely missed.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.787
HARRY:
Indeed, you will.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.075
By none more than me.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.911
Selfridge's has been my life.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.669
I shall miss you all

24:59.832 --> 25:01.834
very dearly.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.930
Perhaps you would consider

25:10.092 --> 25:13.642
acting as an advisor
to Whiteley's,

25:13.804 --> 25:15.852
and help us implement
some of these ideas.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.526
Well, as long as it were
no more than one day a week.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.937
Of course.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.986
I could probably
manage two.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.242
Jimmy! I haven't
had the chance

25:35.409 --> 25:36.911
to congratulate you
on Whiteley's.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.624
Thank you, Mae.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.882
And how's everything else
with you?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.511
You seemed a little
shaken up

25:45.669 --> 25:47.467
by that journalist
at the launch.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.721
Everything's fine.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.973
It didn't look fine.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.931
He was just asking
about my business, that's all.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.891
Sorry, I've got to dash.

26:06.982 --> 26:07.858
All right?

26:08.025 --> 26:09.368
(groans)

26:14.073 --> 26:15.996
May I get you anything?

26:16.158 --> 26:18.206
I have everything I want.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.171
Thank you.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.279
I'm not coming back.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.697
Oh, have you found
something better?

26:54.863 --> 26:55.785
I will.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.711
Your friend Meryl fought
very hard to get you reinstated.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.917
I didn't ask
for her charity.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.048
No, I think
you'd call it loyalty.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.709
Yeah, well,
I'm not going back there

27:06.875 --> 27:08.252
with everyone judging me.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.965
Who's judging you?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.301
You, for starters.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.841
Darling, I spent five years
on the stage.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.975
Do you really think you're
the first girl I've met

27:16.135 --> 27:17.853
who was left
holding a baby?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.558
You were on the stage?

27:19.721 --> 27:22.099
And not a very
respectable one at that.

27:23.684 --> 27:24.856
What about Miss Ellis?

27:25.018 --> 27:28.773
Sarah Ellis no longer works
at Selfridge's.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.567
You're very talented.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.486
It'd be a shame
to see that all go to waste.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.459
I'll hold your position open
until the morning.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.223
Hello?

28:21.450 --> 28:22.576
He's gone.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.668
He's gone.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.818
(sobbing)

28:49.269 --> 28:51.363
I should've been here.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.741
I'm so stupid.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.948
I thought we had months.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.533
It was very quick.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.996
He just fell asleep.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.796
The last thing we did
was fight.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.096
He loved you.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.053
And he knew you loved him.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.111
Yes.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.072
I'm sorry?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.208
Thank you.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.234
(faint conversation)

30:20.694 --> 30:23.368
Roger's gone.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.496
What do you mean
"gone"?

30:26.658 --> 30:30.333
CRABB: He passed
away this afternoon.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.417
What?

30:33.540 --> 30:37.170
<i>CRABB:
Mr. Grove was very ill.</i>

30:37.336 --> 30:40.340
<i>Something he bravely chose
to keep to himself.</i>

30:43.967 --> 30:47.471
Mr. Grove worked here
at the very beginning.

30:47.637 --> 30:52.609
His labors are in every brick
of this building.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.068
Every department,
every display.

30:56.229 --> 30:59.403
He was as much a part
of this store as my name.

31:04.946 --> 31:09.042
He was my friend,

31:09.201 --> 31:13.047
and part of the wider
Selfridge family

31:13.205 --> 31:17.426
to which we all belong.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.394
(sniffling)

31:28.553 --> 31:31.306
I came as soon
as I could.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.228
Mr. Selfridge,
you didn't have to.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.022
What else was I gonna do?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.236
How am I going
to look after them?

31:44.403 --> 31:45.825
(crying)

31:45.987 --> 31:48.536
I don't know the first thing
about being a mother.

31:48.698 --> 31:52.373
You just have to be there.

31:52.536 --> 31:53.788
They're at sea.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.709
They just need something
to cling on to.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.172
We wasted so much time

32:00.335 --> 32:03.635
and danced around for years,
Roger and I.

32:03.797 --> 32:07.802
We had so little time.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.723
But you were together
in the end.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.892
That's what matters.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.607
(crying)

32:24.734 --> 32:27.738
You certainly knew when Roger
was in the building.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.874
However much
I liked Mr. Grove,

32:31.032 --> 32:33.285
I used to be
terrified of him.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.704
Really?

32:34.870 --> 32:38.249
He was always
delightful to me.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.794
He used to give me sherbets
from the cafe.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.588
This is when I first went
to work at the store.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.434
Well, Roger had mellowed
considerably by your time.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.812
I don't think
he cracked a smile once

32:51.970 --> 32:52.971
in the first year
we were open.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.014
Isn't that right,
Mr. Crabb?

32:54.181 --> 32:55.148
I seem to remember

32:55.307 --> 32:56.559
there wasn't a great deal
to smile about.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.443
We almost didn't open.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.819
Several times.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.488
And we wouldn't have,
if it weren't for him.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.233
I remember those days.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.027
I was a lowly assistant.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.413
I used to hide when Mr. Grove
would come down on the floor.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.914
You didn't.
I did!

33:11.072 --> 33:13.495
He must've thought
I was always hopping the wag!

33:19.247 --> 33:20.339
Mr. Grove.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.467
ALL:
Mr. Grove.

33:30.884 --> 33:31.931
Thank you for coming.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.390
I've arranged for my car
to take you home.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.226
Oh, we don't want to be
any trouble.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.140
I think just this once.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.025
Thank you,
Mr. Selfridge.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.608
Thank you, Chief.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.991
You're welcome.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.998
I'm going up.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.333
That was a lovely
evening, Pa.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.839
Goodnight, sweetheart.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.214
Goodnight, Mae.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.253
Goodnight.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.341
Thank you.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.306
I should be going, too.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.893
Don't.

34:26.438 --> 34:29.909
If I stay any longer,
people will talk.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.913
I don't want to be alone.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.998
Well, that's not
a very flattering reason

34:40.161 --> 34:42.083
to ask a woman
to stay the night, Harry.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.963
I mean it.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.172
Stay with me.

35:09.232 --> 35:13.612
PRIEST: We have entrusted
our brother to God's mercy,

35:13.778 --> 35:16.907
and we now commit his body
to the ground--

35:17.073 --> 35:21.499
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust--

35:21.661 --> 35:25.086
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

35:25.248 --> 35:28.001
to eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

35:28.168 --> 35:31.217
who will transform
our frail bodies

35:31.379 --> 35:35.350
that they may be conformed
to his glorious body,

35:35.508 --> 35:39.854
who died, was buried,
and rose again for us.

35:40.013 --> 35:43.108
To him, be glory forever.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.483
Amen.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.816
ALL:
Amen.

35:46.978 --> 35:47.854
(crying)

35:48.021 --> 35:48.647
It's okay.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.689
I've got you.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.950
I've got you.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.202
It's all right.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.471
Mae, wait.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.132
Let me accompany you.

36:15.298 --> 36:19.348
Harry, we can't do this.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.809
I'm your employee,
for heaven's sake.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.473
We both have
our reputations...

36:23.640 --> 36:25.017
I don't care about that.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.480
I know what I feel.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.316
Neither of us know
how we feel.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.903
The last few days,
they've been awful.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.988
It's hard to even
think clearly.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.367
Let us at least talk...

36:35.527 --> 36:36.528
No, Harry, not now.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.663
I need to offer
my condolences.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.505
MAE:
Josie, I am so sorry.

36:46.663 --> 36:47.915
Thank you.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.925
And Meryl.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.462
I saw your father
not long before he died.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.598
He clearly cared about you
very deeply.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.760
What are you talking about?

36:59.926 --> 37:02.645
Well, he reinstated
Miss Brockless because of you.

37:02.804 --> 37:06.308
It was very
important to him.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.353
He obviously thought
the world of you, my dear.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.110
Oh, my dear Meryl.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.701
I was such
a spoiled brat.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.666
Well, you were difficult
and stubborn.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.878
You stood up
for what you believed in.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.417
Just like him.

37:32.584 --> 37:36.009
You are your father's
daughter, Meryl.

37:36.171 --> 37:39.425
He's in everything you do.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.686
He was so proud of you,

37:42.844 --> 37:44.141
and so am I.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.454
I hear you've
got a car, Ernest.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.214
It's a roadster.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.874
I have a model of it.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.714
Why don't you show me?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.093
I'm not sure
it would be right time

38:16.252 --> 38:17.299
to play with toys today.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.964
I'm sure it would be fine.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.804
I used to look after Ernest
for a little while

38:25.970 --> 38:27.517
when he was a baby.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.023
You'll be a great father.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.486
I'm not sure I know
what that means.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.363
Mine wasn't much
of a role model.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.405
Mine wasn't around
at all.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.569
Doesn't mean we have
to repeat their mistakes.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.579
You have a lot
to look forward to.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.708
Sounds like
I'm not the only one.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.994
They're saying
with Whiteley's,

38:49.160 --> 38:51.458
you'll have a mile
of windows in London.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.255
Madame Rennard?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.968
<i>Joe Tooby, London Herald.</i>

39:02.131 --> 39:03.257
I wondered
if I might have a word.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.391
Hardly the time.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.178
How well do you know
Jimmy Dillon?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.596
I've just been
to a funeral.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.638
Or do you think
I'm wearing black

39:08.805 --> 39:10.148
because it's the fashion?

39:10.306 --> 39:12.729
Well, I'm investigating
the death of Victor Colleano.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.236
See, I asked your friend Dillon
about Victor Colleands death

39:15.395 --> 39:17.113
and he acted like I was
accusing him of something.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.865
Were they enemies?

39:21.651 --> 39:24.325
Wait, you asked Jimmy
about Victor

39:24.487 --> 39:25.830
at the Whiteley's launch?

39:25.989 --> 39:26.956
Yeah, why?

39:28.575 --> 39:29.792
No reason.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.295
I'm gonna find out what happened
to Victor anyway,

39:32.453 --> 39:34.330
so you might as well
talk to me now.

39:46.676 --> 39:48.053
CONNIE:
He'll be missed.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.687
He was a good man.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.598
Thank you so much for coming.

39:54.058 --> 39:54.980
Bye.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.316
George.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.125
♪♪

40:22.837 --> 40:27.308
(crying)

40:30.386 --> 40:31.262
Josie?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.646
No, Meryl.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.978
You shouldn't have
to see me like this.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.146
You don't need
to be strong for me.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.658
Why don't we just try
and be there for each other?

41:25.775 --> 41:27.743
I found myself
drawn here.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.664
It's hard to believe

41:31.823 --> 41:33.370
we were here with him
just the other day.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.167
We should do something
with his model,

41:39.330 --> 41:40.502
put it under glass.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.044
The best thing we can do
to commemorate him

41:44.210 --> 41:46.963
is to put these ideas
into action.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.724
We need to find a way
of buying stock first.

41:49.882 --> 41:54.228
I think I have
an answer to that.

41:54.387 --> 41:55.809
I believe you could sell sand
in the Sahara,

41:55.972 --> 41:57.189
but you'd still need sand.

41:59.308 --> 42:01.811
Selling the provincial stores
to property developers

42:01.978 --> 42:04.322
means that we have warehouses
full of stock

42:04.480 --> 42:06.357
with no stores
to put it in.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.492
This will be a temporary fix,

42:08.651 --> 42:12.656
but we can sell the stock
to Whiteley's.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.199
So the provincial stores

42:14.365 --> 42:15.662
no longer need to pay
for storage

42:15.825 --> 42:17.042
and won't be lumbered

42:17.201 --> 42:18.418
with last year's merchandise
gathering dust.

42:18.578 --> 42:19.704
Everybody wins.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.090
Well, as chief executive
of the provincial stores,

42:22.248 --> 42:24.842
I'm happy to offer
Whiteley's credit.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.378
What are we waiting for?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.444
The stock needs to be inside
and on Whiteley's shelves

42:47.607 --> 42:48.699
by opening time.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.030
Not a word to anyone.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.615
Come on then, lads.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.033
Our suppliers wouldn't be happy
to hear about this.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.544
You Selfridges
are incredible.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.579
We're just
getting started.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.549
(doorbell ringing)

43:16.094 --> 43:17.346
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

43:17.512 --> 43:18.434
Come in.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.685
Can I get you a drink?

43:26.145 --> 43:27.647
I'll come straight to it.

43:27.814 --> 43:30.192
Why did you lie to me?

43:35.613 --> 43:38.787
That journalist
at the launch.

43:38.950 --> 43:42.079
You told me he just asked you
routine business questions.

43:42.245 --> 43:43.212
He did.

43:43.371 --> 43:45.294
He asked you about Victor.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.084
Yes-- my business with Victor.

43:48.251 --> 43:54.179
He told me that he specifically
asked you about Victor's death

43:54.340 --> 43:57.890
and that you reacted
suspiciously.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.013
And that you reacted
suspiciously.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.022
You think I had something
to do with it'?

44:02.181 --> 44:04.309
Did you?

44:06.352 --> 44:07.649
How can you think that, Mae?

44:07.812 --> 44:10.440
I've seen your temper.

44:10.606 --> 44:15.954
Yes, I blow up once in a while,
and I'm not proud of it.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.490
But do you really think
I'm capable of murder?

44:23.077 --> 44:25.671
(laughs)

44:33.212 --> 44:36.216
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

44:37.884 --> 44:41.559
Mae, I know we've had
our differences.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.850
But you've been closer to me
than anyone.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.313
Victor's death...

44:48.686 --> 44:50.609
It's upset me so much.

44:53.774 --> 44:56.323
I don't know what to think
anymore.

45:04.952 --> 45:09.173
That reporter works
for Lord Wynnstay.

45:09.332 --> 45:13.257
He's after anything
he can smear Harry with.

45:13.419 --> 45:16.798
Now I'm his business partner,
I'm fair game.

45:16.964 --> 45:21.561
If they blacken my name,
they bring him down.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.893
You know what the press
are like, Mae.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.150
I'm sorry to say it,

45:27.308 --> 45:30.061
but you're helping them
stir up trouble.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.777
For me and Harry.

45:35.858 --> 45:39.408
Mae, have you thought
what this could do to him?

45:39.570 --> 45:41.538
Just how damaging
you could be?
