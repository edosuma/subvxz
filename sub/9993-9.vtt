00:00.667 --> 00:02.600
Hello. I'm Rod Serling,

00:02.789 --> 00:06.247
speaking to you this evening from somewhere just beyond the Twilight Zone.

00:06.698 --> 00:09.307
Submitted for your approval or at least your analysis:

00:09.364 --> 00:12.527
the strange case of you, the viewing audience.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.749
The bizarre events in this evening's episode of Medium

00:15.800 --> 00:18.181
cannot be confined to two dimensions.

00:18.290 --> 00:21.837
Certain sequences of the story demand to be presented in 3D,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.337
so keep your glasses close at hand,

00:24.520 --> 00:27.785
seat yourself approximately six to eight feet from your screen,

00:28.163 --> 00:30.652
and whenever you see the logo in the corner--

00:31.152 --> 00:33.681
that's it right there-- put your glasses on.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.654
If you don't have them, don't worry.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.689
You can still enjoy the episode.

00:38.479 --> 00:39.644
And now hold on.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.434
Our next stop, the Medium Zone.

00:43.272 --> 00:44.569
I'm not really an art person,

00:44.901 --> 00:46.487
but ever since I was little girl,

00:46.538 --> 00:47.830
when I look at a work of art,

00:47.881 --> 00:50.096
I sense things about the person who made it.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.860
I think it might be because really gifted people can't help but leave a

00:53.911 --> 00:55.616
piece of their souls on the canvas.

00:56.699 --> 01:01.555
Ever wonder why the Mona Lisa is smiling or what's bothering Whistler's mother?

01:02.154 --> 01:04.778
I really believe if I were ever able to get to Paris

01:04.881 --> 01:06.102
and look at the original paintings,

01:06.153 --> 01:07.672
I might be able to tell you.

01:08.924 --> 01:10.294
Like this guy here.

01:10.810 --> 01:11.904
Look at his face.

01:12.127 --> 01:13.367
What do you see?

01:13.666 --> 01:16.044
An artistic genius or a jilted lover?

01:16.616 --> 01:18.919
Creative fulfillment or massive self-loathing?

01:19.908 --> 01:23.382
Simple exhaustion or overwhelming depression?

02:23.249 --> 02:26.386
Vincent Van Gogh fell in love twice in his life,

02:26.520 --> 02:28.123
but was spurned by both women.

02:28.858 --> 02:32.717
He ended up spending most of his short adult life
in and out of mental institutions,

02:33.450 --> 02:35.313
until at the age of 36,

02:35.679 --> 02:37.628
after a ten-year frenzy of painting,

02:38.814 --> 02:40.784
he decided to end it all.

03:00.569 --> 03:03.742
Van Gogh committed suicide at the height of his artistic powers.

03:04.208 --> 03:07.285
Tragically, he sold but one canvas during his entire life.

03:08.192 --> 03:10.420
If you like vital programs like the one you just saw,

03:10.584 --> 03:12.650
we urge you to give and give generously.

03:59.196 --> 04:02.562
Oliver Wendell Holmes was appointed to the Supreme Court by President

04:02.613 --> 04:04.627
Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.773
He is one of the most important justices in American history

04:08.824 --> 04:12.170
- and is sometimes called "The Great Dissenter"
- What does that mean?

04:13.067 --> 04:16.543
He was called that because he disagreed so often with the other judges.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.087
His important cases were...

04:19.137 --> 04:20.410
But I don't understand.

04:20.599 --> 04:22.658
I thought that disagreements were bad.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.331
Mom...

04:25.798 --> 04:27.457
Bridgette, Ariel's practicing.

04:27.508 --> 04:30.037
Why don't we listen to what she has to say and we'll ask questions afterwards?

04:31.370 --> 04:32.145
I was listening.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.287
Ooh, look at you.

04:34.655 --> 04:36.671
Wow, Daddy,
you sure look nice.

04:37.097 --> 04:38.439
Did you hear the first part?

04:38.532 --> 04:41.489
I was riveted, and it's the fifth time I've heard it.

04:41.923 --> 04:43.064
Now hang on one sec,

04:43.115 --> 04:45.482
and I'm coming over to hear the thrilling conclusion.

04:46.928 --> 04:47.913
You're kidding, right?

04:48.060 --> 04:49.909
Well, it's the law of probabilities.

04:50.376 --> 04:51.477
Every time you wear a tie,

04:51.528 --> 04:53.475
it goes into your coffee or your coffee gets on it.

04:54.111 --> 04:56.283
Come on, this is your one tie.

04:56.334 --> 04:57.953
Your boss asked you out to lunch.

04:58.446 --> 04:59.953
Thought you might want to keep it clean.

05:00.154 --> 05:01.269
I do want to keep it clean,

05:01.320 --> 05:03.901
but if I put this thing under my chin and anyone sees it,

05:03.952 --> 05:05.651
they're going to take away my "man" card,

05:05.702 --> 05:06.785
and we don't want that.

05:07.626 --> 05:08.787
Ah, suit yourself.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.211
Hello, ladies.

05:13.253 --> 05:14.284
Now, you were saying...?

05:15.869 --> 05:16.675
Daddy.

05:17.738 --> 05:19.369
You still look nice, Daddy.

05:26.082 --> 05:27.330
Okay...

05:28.377 --> 05:29.321
See what I can do.

05:34.179 --> 05:35.849
Ariel, finish making the lunches!

05:35.900 --> 05:38.070
And, Bridgette, honey, brush your teeth!

05:39.271 --> 05:40.465
Don't waste your time.

05:40.646 --> 05:41.553
That one's had it.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.088
You can't do that.

05:45.548 --> 05:47.694
Yeah, that's one of the best parts of being dead.

05:48.488 --> 05:50.299
Yeah, you just wait till it's your turn.
You'll see.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.607
What are you doing here?

05:52.168 --> 05:54.707
I'm just visiting my only son and his only wife.

05:56.512 --> 05:57.458
Go figure.

05:58.011 --> 06:00.601
Boy's pushing 40,
and every time he dresses up,

06:00.680 --> 06:02.289
he  still fidgets like he's...

06:02.543 --> 06:04.657
he's going out to have his class picture taken.

06:07.989 --> 06:09.410
Forget it, forget it. Just...

06:10.082 --> 06:13.146
get him the one that's in your bottom
drawer that you're saving for Christmas.

06:13.993 --> 06:14.785
What?

06:16.008 --> 06:16.905
What do you want?

06:17.740 --> 06:18.930
Just concerned about my boy.

06:20.462 --> 06:23.713
Now, we both know that he can't make grown-up decisions.

06:23.787 --> 06:25.362
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know that.

06:25.985 --> 06:26.676
Please...

06:27.569 --> 06:29.225
What? What is your problem?

06:29.276 --> 06:31.231
You had no time for this man when you were alive.

06:31.282 --> 06:32.812
Now you're dead you think you can just

06:32.930 --> 06:36.006
pop in whenever the hell you want
and offer some fatherly advice?!

06:36.062 --> 06:37.081
Leave us alone!

06:37.600 --> 06:38.529
This is my bathroom!

06:38.590 --> 06:39.739
I'd like a little privacy!

06:39.790 --> 06:42.570
I'd like to be able to use the toilet, if you don't mind!

06:43.084 --> 06:43.703
Hey...

06:44.120 --> 06:45.140
no problem.

06:45.823 --> 06:46.849
I'll tell him to call back.

06:48.362 --> 06:49.475
Tell who to call back?

06:49.751 --> 06:51.143
Detective Scanlon.

06:51.846 --> 06:52.869
Any luck with that?

06:53.309 --> 06:57.167
No. In my bottom drawer,
there's a new one in a Christmas box.

06:57.924 --> 06:58.650
Really?

06:59.089 --> 07:00.435
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
give me the phone.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.233
Thanks. Hello?

07:29.113 --> 07:30.104
Oh, my God.

07:31.062 --> 07:31.864
Who was it?

07:32.913 --> 07:33.700
I don't know.

07:34.449 --> 07:35.638
They haven't found a body yet.

07:42.023 --> 07:44.659
Doesn't  look like you'd have to look very far.

07:45.267 --> 07:46.308
We've been all over the park.

07:46.359 --> 07:47.060
Nothing.

07:49.801 --> 07:53.116
So far, all I've got is what looks like
a couple of quarts of type O-positive

07:53.167 --> 07:54.769
and a vagrant who claims he heard a man

07:54.820 --> 07:56.623
and a woman arguing in here sometime last night.

07:57.530 --> 07:58.329
I called the morgue.

07:59.038 --> 08:00.504
No John or Jane Does were brought in.

08:00.555 --> 08:02.102
Same deal with the hospitals.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.083
You okay?

08:10.168 --> 08:11.122
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

08:11.637 --> 08:13.898
Does "Jack's Gal" mean anything?

08:14.639 --> 08:15.716
Hope you brought your appetite.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.602
Absolutely. It travels with me wherever I go.

08:20.402 --> 08:22.403
So, I'm guessing you know this by heart.

08:22.814 --> 08:25.920
Afraid so. Probably eaten here at least twice a week for the last eight years.

08:26.861 --> 08:28.499
So what do you recommend?
What's good?

08:29.391 --> 08:30.790
Me? I recommend change.

08:30.841 --> 08:33.846
I recommend that nobody eat in the same place twice a week for eight years.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.201
It dulls the palate and mutes the soul.

08:41.197 --> 08:42.528
I'm leaving Aerodytech, Joe.

08:42.578 --> 08:44.197
I'm giving my notice at the end of the day.

08:47.054 --> 08:48.023
Okay.

08:51.442 --> 08:53.021
Well, congratulations, I guess.

08:54.070 --> 08:56.144
Our loss is somebody else's gain.

08:58.063 --> 08:59.189
So who poached you?

08:59.237 --> 09:01.317
Was it Grumman? Boeing?

09:01.608 --> 09:02.570
Nobody poached me.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.001
I'm starting my own company.

09:05.175 --> 09:06.853
And the reason I asked you to lunch is,

09:07.459 --> 09:09.751
well... I need a partner.

09:10.287 --> 09:11.182
I've got the financing,

09:11.233 --> 09:12.503
but I need a sounding board,

09:12.659 --> 09:13.259
a confidante,

09:13.231 --> 09:15.506
not to mention a gifted engineer.

09:18.449 --> 09:19.280
Close your mouth, Joe.

09:19.331 --> 09:20.126
You'll draw flies.

09:21.262 --> 09:23.557
What do you do if someone knocks on the door?

09:23.825 --> 09:24.650
I don't open it.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.182
What do you do if you smell smoke?

09:26.283 --> 09:27.821
I dial 911.

09:28.024 --> 09:31.874
And what do you do if I want to watch something and you don't?

09:32.978 --> 09:35.750
I want a regular babysitter.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.625
We don't need a regular babysitter.

09:38.015 --> 09:39.065
I'm old enough to babysit,

09:39.116 --> 09:41.121
and besides, it's an emergency.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.040
Right, Mom?

09:42.571 --> 09:43.285
Bridgette, honey,

09:43.336 --> 09:44.564
Daddy called at the last minute.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.293
He wants me to meet him for dinner downtown.

09:46.344 --> 09:48.787
There's something very important he wants to talk about.

09:49.136 --> 09:52.090
I don't care!
She's going to be mean to me!

09:52.227 --> 09:54.763
She's not going to be mean to you.
She's your sister.

09:54.814 --> 09:55.573
Now come on.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.060
Mom!

09:57.111 --> 09:58.975
Okay, come on, everybody out.
I'm going to be late.

09:59.026 --> 09:59.626
Let's go.

09:59.564 --> 10:02.021
Come on, out.
Out, out, out, out. Go.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.272
He says he's got to know in three days.

10:05.323 --> 10:06.459
Something about the financing.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.049
Well, what do you think?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.035
What do I think?

10:10.193 --> 10:12.587
I think it's scary and flattering,

10:13.169 --> 10:14.433
and scary and flattering,

10:14.484 --> 10:16.003
and scary and...

10:16.349 --> 10:19.576
The guy's the best combination of businessman and engineer I've ever met.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.952
I keep thinking about all these magazine articles I've read about Wozniak

10:23.632 --> 10:25.976
and Jobs getting together, about...

10:27.138 --> 10:28.612
Bill Gates and Paul Allen.

10:28.663 --> 10:30.974
I keep wondering if this is the beginning of something like that.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.139
And then I keep thinking about the...

10:35.255 --> 10:37.236
the company health plan,

10:37.467 --> 10:39.013
and my great parking space,

10:39.404 --> 10:41.106
and the company Christmas party--

10:41.172 --> 10:43.777
the stupid stuff I've come to depend on.

10:46.469 --> 10:47.151
H ey.

10:47.327 --> 10:48.666
No fair. Where'd you go?

10:49.446 --> 10:50.466
What does that say?

10:51.059 --> 10:52.154
What's what say?

11:10.758 --> 11:11.725
Jason Morrow.

11:13.769 --> 11:16.309
Okay, tree with stuff hanging from it.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.171
Nice.

11:18.835 --> 11:19.917
I kind of like this one.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.036
I  wonder who she is.

11:22.499 --> 11:25.462
She's so beautiful and her eyes are so sad.

11:28.196 --> 11:29.135
Her eyes?

11:36.323 --> 11:37.323
Are you okay?

11:38.007 --> 11:39.940
Yeah... I'm fine.

11:39.991 --> 11:40.884
Sorry.

11:42.773 --> 11:43.649
It just looked like...

11:45.089 --> 11:46.051
Never mind.

11:46.403 --> 11:47.185
You sure?

11:48.572 --> 11:49.607
What time did you tell the kids?

13:18.545 --> 13:19.251
Allison...

13:21.008 --> 13:21.641
Allison.

13:23.340 --> 13:23.980
Allison.

13:40.899 --> 13:42.628
Quite a set of lungs on that one.

13:43.335 --> 13:44.456
Must take after her mother.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.518
Do you mind?

13:46.256 --> 13:49.549
Me? I'm dead. I don't mind much of anything anymore.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.573
Well, I do, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just go away.

13:53.173 --> 13:54.204
I can't go away,

13:54.255 --> 13:55.122
Allie dear.

13:55.173 --> 13:56.370
Not until I've...

13:56.695 --> 13:57.574
I've said my piece.

13:57.905 --> 13:58.588
About what?

13:59.468 --> 14:00.126
My son--

14:00.215 --> 14:01.097
the entrepreneur.

14:02.056 --> 14:04.671
Oh... you know about that, huh?

14:05.015 --> 14:05.912
I know everything.

14:06.626 --> 14:08.959
That's one of the perks of my current condition.

14:10.468 --> 14:14.042
Now, look, far be it from me to stand in the way of my son's dream.

14:14.516 --> 14:17.344
But trust me when I say that this new business venture

14:17.395 --> 14:19.346
is not the right way for him to go.

14:19.639 --> 14:20.979
And why would I do that?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.172
Trust you, I mean.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.393
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

14:24.606 --> 14:28.121
It means you never once supported any of Joe's decisions.

14:28.288 --> 14:29.596
Even when you were alive.

14:30.191 --> 14:31.844
I let him marry you, didn't I?

14:33.967 --> 14:35.002
Fine, be that way.

14:35.053 --> 14:40.315
Just make sure that Joe knows that Versailles's running on fumes.

14:41.817 --> 14:42.666
What?

14:43.104 --> 14:43.900
Just tell him that.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.904
Versailles's running on fumes.

14:45.955 --> 14:46.836
He needs to hear that.

14:46.959 --> 14:47.589
It's important.

14:52.713 --> 14:55.019
Thought you might want to know we got a positive ID on the owner of that

14:55.070 --> 14:56.771
blood we found in the park yesterday.

14:57.133 --> 14:57.984
Gloria Soto.

14:58.242 --> 14:59.510
Mexican citizen,

14:59.561 --> 15:00.905
but a frequent border-hopper.

15:01.036 --> 15:02.484
That's how we had her DNA on file.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.462
She was brought in on a solicitation charge in El Paso.

15:05.728 --> 15:07.455
So that explains what she was doing in the park.

15:12.753 --> 15:13.423
What?

15:17.973 --> 15:19.062
I've seen this woman before.

15:19.312 --> 15:20.136
Last night, actually.

15:20.911 --> 15:21.890
What do you mean?

15:21.941 --> 15:24.219
Like in a dream?

15:24.417 --> 15:25.301
It  was in a gallery.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.572
I was at this art gallery and this local artist,

15:27.623 --> 15:28.862
Jason Morrow--

15:29.033 --> 15:30.783
I saw this woman in one of his paintings.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.177
You sure it was her?

15:33.661 --> 15:35.193
Can you take me there, to that gallery?

15:35.319 --> 15:36.262
I don't think it'll help.

15:37.715 --> 15:40.245
The painting in the gallery is of the back of her head.

15:41.343 --> 15:42.716
Then how do you know it's Gloria Soto?

15:43.634 --> 15:44.253
Because...

15:45.676 --> 15:46.985
she turned and looked at me.

15:51.079 --> 15:51.929
Hello?

15:52.414 --> 15:53.102
Jason?

15:55.109 --> 15:56.097
Jason Morrow?

16:01.864 --> 16:02.915
Detective Scanlon.

16:04.177 --> 16:06.615
This is Allison Dubois with the District Attorney's office.

16:07.753 --> 16:08.443
We're, uh...

16:09.741 --> 16:12.177
we're working a missing persons case and your name came up during the

16:12.228 --> 16:13.262
course of our investigation.

16:14.221 --> 16:15.336
That sounds ominous.

16:16.388 --> 16:17.243
Who's gone missing?

16:17.640 --> 16:18.443
Gloria Soto.

16:19.052 --> 16:20.840
She's a Mexican, 34 years of age.

16:21.623 --> 16:22.405
Very pretty.

16:24.579 --> 16:25.854
I'm sorry, I don't know that name.

16:26.737 --> 16:27.833
Maybe you'll know the face.

16:34.969 --> 16:38.044
No. I've never actually seen this woman before.

16:38.344 --> 16:41.160
Wait a second. Are you telling me
that she never posed for you?

16:41.396 --> 16:42.135
That's right.

16:42.645 --> 16:43.683
I don't use models.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.698
Actually, Gloria was a prostitute.

16:46.528 --> 16:47.667
I don't use those either.

16:49.977 --> 16:52.316
But if you could tell me how my name came up,

16:52.367 --> 16:53.947
perhaps I could be of a little more help.

17:38.088 --> 17:38.781
Allison...

17:39.445 --> 17:40.196
Allison, you okay?

17:43.038 --> 17:44.549
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.604
Could... could I trouble you for a glass of water?

17:49.653 --> 17:51.018
In that back room over there.

18:43.485 --> 18:44.362
What are you doing?

18:45.297 --> 18:46.336
It's not just me, right?

18:46.947 --> 18:48.405
You see her face, too?

18:49.366 --> 18:50.279
Plain as day.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.240
Want to tell me again, Mr. Morrow,

18:52.291 --> 18:53.723
how you never met Gloria Soto?

19:09.356 --> 19:10.140
Good morning.

19:10.588 --> 19:11.401
Good morning.

19:14.261 --> 19:15.508
Um, if I could just have a word.

19:15.618 --> 19:16.395
Excuse us.

19:19.421 --> 19:20.522
Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:20.737 --> 19:21.698
That's my office.

19:22.321 --> 19:23.037
I know, I know,

19:23.088 --> 19:25.059
and honestly, we've been in there all of three minutes.

19:25.110 --> 19:26.077
He insisted.

19:26.128 --> 19:27.092
And he is?

19:27.201 --> 19:27.998
David Morrow--

19:28.049 --> 19:30.330
worth conservatively a quarter of a billion dollars.

19:30.381 --> 19:31.657
Or at least his late wife was.

19:31.708 --> 19:32.376
Okay.

19:32.522 --> 19:33.440
And late last night,

19:33.491 --> 19:34.817
apparently on your say-so,

19:34.951 --> 19:37.665
his son was ordered held in connection with some missing persons case.

19:37.716 --> 19:39.413
So he called his good friend the mayor,

19:39.464 --> 19:40.403
who called you...

19:40.454 --> 19:41.416
At 3:30 this morning...

19:41.467 --> 19:43.845
And told you to get down here and convince me to let him go.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.542
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint His Honor,

19:46.593 --> 19:47.926
but as he very well knows,

19:47.977 --> 19:49.718
I can hold a suspect, any suspect,

19:49.769 --> 19:51.145
rich, poor or otherwise,

19:51.196 --> 19:54.345
without actually charging him for 24 hours.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.128
No, he knows that.

19:56.441 --> 20:00.250
It's just-- since there's no firm evidence to actually implicate this man,

20:00.345 --> 20:02.815
we were wondering if you could possibly see your way clear...

20:02.866 --> 20:03.704
No, I can't.

20:03.755 --> 20:06.601
And you tell the mayor I have a bathroom full of blood and a team of

20:06.652 --> 20:09.218
professional investigators telling me that Jason Morrow is connected.

20:09.607 --> 20:10.455
That's enough for me,

20:10.506 --> 20:11.754
and  it should be enough for the mayor.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.848
Mr. District Attorney,

20:13.899 --> 20:14.778
David Morrow.

20:14.829 --> 20:15.541
Mr. Morrow.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.202
I couldn't help but overhear the tail end of that exchange.

20:18.858 --> 20:20.886
Look, just so everyone's intentions are clear--

20:21.497 --> 20:22.792
when this evening rolls around,

20:23.250 --> 20:25.683
if you still don't have enough evidence to charge my son,

20:25.734 --> 20:30.551
I will be filing a lawsuit against you and
the City of Phoenix for wrongful arrest.

20:32.159 --> 20:33.395
You thank the mayor for his help.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.340
I'll see myself out.

20:51.255 --> 20:52.490
It's not here.

20:54.357 --> 20:55.172
I'll get it.

20:56.816 --> 20:57.568
Hello.

20:58.498 --> 20:59.915
Oh, good morning, sir.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.548
You did?

21:01.599 --> 21:03.516
Well, I'm sorry. I lost it.

21:05.197 --> 21:05.935
I found it!

21:06.252 --> 21:07.412
Joe found it.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.532
It's Devalos. He was trying
to call me on my cell phone.

21:11.059 --> 21:12.366
Yeah, I can be there at 10:30.

21:13.326 --> 21:14.173
Fine.

21:14.266 --> 21:14.944
Thank you.

21:15.805 --> 21:16.459
Thank you.

21:18.666 --> 21:19.266
Look at you.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.729
You're as nervous as a cat.

21:23.507 --> 21:26.188
I-I haven't been to a lawyer since we bought this house.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.823
You have your little list of questions?

21:29.338 --> 21:30.151
Do I ever.

21:30.278 --> 21:31.894
I got my health insurance packet,

21:31.945 --> 21:33.729
Aerodytech contract,

21:33.780 --> 21:35.456
my pension fund statements.

21:35.607 --> 21:37.509
You know,
the irony is I'm going to spend the whole day with this guy,

21:37.560 --> 21:38.308
and then when it's over,

21:38.359 --> 21:39.993
I'm still not going to know whether to do it or not.

21:40.635 --> 21:41.410
I'm sorry, honey,

21:41.461 --> 21:42.530
I wish I had an answer.

21:44.711 --> 21:45.638
What good are you?

21:47.135 --> 21:48.320
I'll show you what good I am.

21:56.062 --> 21:57.818
Does the name "Versailles" mean anything to you?

21:58.221 --> 22:00.585
Used to be a big fancy building in France.

22:01.100 --> 22:01.817
Why?

22:03.657 --> 22:06.124
Well, your father showed up again here last night.

22:07.116 --> 22:10.007
And he told me you shouldn't go into business with Andrew because...

22:10.129 --> 22:11.191
Wait, I want to get this right...

22:14.327 --> 22:15.944
"Versailles is running on fumes.

22:17.172 --> 22:20.471
" "Versailles is running on fumes?" It was the middle of the night,

22:20.522 --> 22:22.792
and it was your father.

22:24.086 --> 22:25.501
He told me you needed to hear that.

22:27.176 --> 22:28.014
Thanks, Dad.

22:29.270 --> 22:31.559
I'll be sure and tell that to the lawyer.

22:34.961 --> 22:35.871
Do I look okay?

22:36.836 --> 22:38.305
I'm paying this guy $250 an hour,

22:38.356 --> 22:39.694
and I'm worried about what I look like.

22:39.745 --> 22:41.454
You look like a captain of industry.

22:41.645 --> 22:43.391
You look like an admiral of industry.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.531
Admiral's bigger than captain, right?

22:45.655 --> 22:46.563
I have no idea.

22:46.637 --> 22:47.256
I got to go.

22:48.232 --> 22:49.163
I understand, Judge,

22:49.214 --> 22:51.709
but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you I think you're making a mistake.

22:54.193 --> 22:56.817
Jason Morrow is our only connection to this missing woman.

22:58.194 --> 22:59.225
Respectfully, I disagree...

23:02.079 --> 23:03.419
We will work harder, sir.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.288
You count on it.

23:07.247 --> 23:07.974
No warrant.

23:08.977 --> 23:10.768
The judge seems to feel that we're reaching.

23:11.508 --> 23:14.317
So, I guess Jason Morrow's car, home, studio--

23:14.368 --> 23:15.272
they're all off limits?

23:15.499 --> 23:17.393
Well, we can still hold him for another 10 hours,

23:17.444 --> 23:20.132
but unless we have any physical evidence that he was involved in the

23:20.183 --> 23:22.495
disappearance of Gloria Soto, he'll walk.

23:23.518 --> 23:26.110
I wish I could tell you that I had a dream last night that would narrow

23:26.161 --> 23:27.389
down the search for the body.

23:28.859 --> 23:32.579
But so far I've only been able to see things
when I look at one of Morrow's paintings.

23:32.853 --> 23:33.478
Well, in that case,

23:33.529 --> 23:37.071
I think you'll appreciate the homework
we've assembled for you in the conference room.

23:47.464 --> 23:48.532
47 paintings in total,

23:48.583 --> 23:50.355
every one of them a Jason Morrow original.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.422
Figure it'll keep you busy for the rest of the morning.

23:52.902 --> 23:55.540
Wait, I thought that we couldn't get a search warrant on his studio?

23:55.591 --> 23:56.253
We couldn't.

23:57.082 --> 23:59.209
I spent most of last night visiting all the local galleries,

23:59.260 --> 24:01.444
flashing my badge and asking if the Phoenix P.D.

24:01.495 --> 24:03.401
could "borrow" everything they had by Jason Morrow.

24:03.624 --> 24:05.460
Just watch where you put that coffee;

24:05.511 --> 24:06.241
we break anything,

24:06.292 --> 24:07.063
we pay for it.

24:07.854 --> 24:09.155
Give us a call if you see something.

24:10.339 --> 24:11.301
Where are you going?

24:11.889 --> 24:14.644
I'm going to go look for a tree with
a hundred pairs of sneakers dangling from it.

24:26.080 --> 24:31.997
"Self Portrait." Jason, it doesn't look a thing like you.

25:15.043 --> 25:16.525
Good-bye, my darling.

25:32.351 --> 25:33.011
Hello?

25:34.268 --> 25:36.284
How much you know about local high school football?

25:36.892 --> 25:37.893
Not much. Why?

25:38.913 --> 25:41.746
It turns out the Flagstaff Cougars have this funny little tradition.

25:43.052 --> 25:46.281
Every year the graduating seniors tie their cleats together and throw them

25:46.332 --> 25:49.460
over the branches of a dead ash tree
near their favorite drinking spot in the woods.

25:49.950 --> 25:52.188
If I give you directions,
how soon can you be here?

26:07.045 --> 26:08.559
One adult female, one male child.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.497
Forensic techs figure they've been here at least 20 years.

26:12.299 --> 26:14.531
Which means she couldn't possibly be Gloria Soto.

26:15.193 --> 26:17.590
And unless Jason Morrow was one very advanced toddler...

26:19.480 --> 26:20.721
I'm guessing he's not our killer.

26:23.848 --> 26:26.443
We're 20 hours into the custody of Jason Morrow,

26:26.494 --> 26:28.812
and we're still no closer to finding the body of Gloria Soto.

26:28.863 --> 26:30.164
We have, however,

26:30.215 --> 26:32.068
found two bodies that we weren't looking for,

26:32.119 --> 26:35.606
but we can be reasonably certain that
our suspect had nothing to do with their deaths,

26:35.657 --> 26:37.304
given the fact that he was a toddler at the time.

26:37.355 --> 26:38.226
I don't know what to tell you.

26:38.277 --> 26:41.620
All I can say is, I saw
Gloria Soto being buried in that grave.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.132
No, you didn't.

26:44.047 --> 26:45.362
You saw her mother, Inez Soto.

26:45.413 --> 26:46.806
We I.D.'d her off her dental records.

26:46.857 --> 26:50.168
They matched a missing persons report her family filed in Mexico in 1982.

26:50.572 --> 26:51.294
1982?

26:52.402 --> 26:53.002
Apparently,

26:52.836 --> 26:55.121
the Mexican authorities forwarded it to us at the time.

26:55.995 --> 26:57.611
Someone spent about a half a day looking into it,

26:57.662 --> 26:59.587
and then it sat in a drawer until this afternoon.

27:03.266 --> 27:06.200
Oh, my God, she looks exactly like her daughter.

27:07.618 --> 27:09.835
I thought I saw someone digging a grave for Gloria,

27:09.886 --> 27:12.391
but I must've seen someone digging a grave for her mother.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.751
Now, here's an interesting factoid--

27:15.300 --> 27:18.051
care to guess who Inez was working for when she disappeared in '82?

27:19.272 --> 27:20.117
According to the file--

27:21.210 --> 27:22.235
David Morrow.

27:22.306 --> 27:22.906
Wait a second,

27:22.670 --> 27:25.629
the woman whose corpse you just found worked for Jason Morrow's father?

27:26.133 --> 27:28.220
According to her family, she was working for him as a maid,

27:28.271 --> 27:30.554
making money to send back home to Mexico to her daughter.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.064
Had a son, too. Tomas.

27:32.329 --> 27:33.321
He was born here in the States.

27:33.372 --> 27:34.517
Disappeared when she did.

27:34.774 --> 27:35.692
That must've been the boy,

27:35.743 --> 27:37.301
the same one I saw in Jason's paintings.

27:39.390 --> 27:39.990
I have...

27:41.142 --> 27:42.027
a present for you,

27:42.141 --> 27:43.136
by the way.

27:43.409 --> 27:44.725
A little something, to, uh,

27:45.378 --> 27:46.626
complete your collection.

27:47.225 --> 27:47.982
Where did this come from?

27:48.656 --> 27:51.606
Stopped by to see Jason Morrow in his holding cell to see if his plush

27:51.657 --> 27:54.752
surroundings triggered any new recollections about Gloria Soto.

27:55.285 --> 27:56.713
He was working on it the whole time I was there--

27:56.764 --> 27:57.943
I asked him if I could see it.

27:58.955 --> 27:59.833
He told me to keep it.

28:20.544 --> 28:22.201
Good-bye, my darling.

28:29.865 --> 28:32.329
Feel better, little baby.

28:36.967 --> 28:38.498
There were two little babies--

28:38.549 --> 28:39.338
there had to be.

28:39.389 --> 28:40.948
There was Inez's son,

28:41.391 --> 28:42.254
and there was Jason.

28:42.305 --> 28:43.578
Jason was a witness.

28:43.976 --> 28:45.009
He doesn't remember anything;

28:45.238 --> 28:45.898
he was too young.

28:45.949 --> 28:47.010
But it's all in there.

28:47.466 --> 28:49.449
Every time I see one of his paintings come to life,

28:49.500 --> 28:51.863
I'm seeing what happened through his eyes.

28:52.629 --> 28:54.495
I-I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.

28:54.699 --> 28:55.461
Well, think about it.

28:55.512 --> 28:57.218
He couldn't have killed the mother and son.

28:58.046 --> 28:59.863
But he could have seen his father do it.

29:00.797 --> 29:03.906
Look, I think what happened to Inez and her son is terrible.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.912
From what little I remember of them, they were nice people.

29:07.618 --> 29:10.176
But if you're suggesting that I had anything to do with their deaths...

29:10.451 --> 29:11.808
We just wanted to ask you a few questions.

29:12.326 --> 29:14.685
Well, considering the fact
that you just released my son

29:14.736 --> 29:16.984
after incarcerating him for 24 hours,

29:17.061 --> 29:19.524
you'll forgive me if I'm not feeling especially cooperative.

29:20.858 --> 29:22.724
You ever been convicted of a felony, Mr. Morrow?

29:24.404 --> 29:26.337
Yes, I was arrested several times,

29:26.388 --> 29:28.132
but I'm guessing that you already know that.

29:28.538 --> 29:29.836
Heroin possession, right?

29:30.632 --> 29:32.287
It happened over 20 years ago, Detective.

29:33.455 --> 29:34.609
A youthful indiscretion.

29:34.904 --> 29:37.014
More like three youthful indiscretions, actually.

29:37.604 --> 29:39.642
What about assault and battery charges your wife filed?

29:40.917 --> 29:42.140
Emily dropped those charges.

29:42.391 --> 29:43.540
It was a misunderstanding.

29:44.404 --> 29:45.455
Now, are you finished,

29:45.521 --> 29:46.771
or do I need to call my lawyer?

29:46.841 --> 29:47.926
No, no.

29:48.014 --> 29:49.490
I've only got one more question for you.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.365
Why'd you kill Inez and her kid?

29:55.191 --> 29:56.301
She hear something she shouldn't have?

29:56.502 --> 29:57.891
Try to blackmail you, maybe?

29:58.820 --> 29:59.686
That's your theory?

30:00.042 --> 30:01.749
I killed her to protect my money.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.915
That's a good theory, it's clever,
except for one thing.

30:05.478 --> 30:06.656
Everything you see here,

30:06.729 --> 30:08.132
none of it belongs to me.

30:09.116 --> 30:10.104
It never has.

30:11.486 --> 30:13.050
My wife's family didn't particularly like me,

30:13.101 --> 30:16.055
and I'm guessing that had something to do with the arrest that you mentioned.

30:16.619 --> 30:18.039
While my wife was alive,

30:18.090 --> 30:19.778
we lived off of her trust fund,

30:20.287 --> 30:21.545
and after my wife passed,

30:21.858 --> 30:25.432
all of the assets were transferred to my son Jason. Okay?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.366
This house is his.
Everything.

30:27.781 --> 30:28.638
He lets me live here.

30:28.934 --> 30:29.593
He gives me...

30:31.945 --> 30:32.545
an allowance,

30:32.588 --> 30:33.501
I guess you could call it.

30:36.541 --> 30:37.254
Okay.

30:39.721 --> 30:40.930
Maybe you two had an affair.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.046
She called it off...

30:44.553 --> 30:45.555
Detective,

30:46.088 --> 30:47.229
you're embarrassing yourself.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.182
I told you not to play with that boy!

30:54.353 --> 30:55.450
He can make you sick.

30:55.944 --> 30:56.842
He can kill you.

30:58.032 --> 30:59.036
Now, tilt your head back.

30:59.316 --> 31:02.127
Dr. Tedesco said we have to be sure to get every drop of blood off you.

31:06.850 --> 31:08.236
Keep your eyes open.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.618
...guess we'll be giving you a call, and, uh,

31:19.748 --> 31:21.519
you can come down to the station to make a statement.

31:22.259 --> 31:23.148
That was productive.

31:23.252 --> 31:24.130
Actually, it was.

31:25.572 --> 31:26.517
You saw something in there?

31:26.969 --> 31:29.160
I saw Inez Soto again when I was looking at that painting.

31:29.211 --> 31:30.731
She was giving one of the boys a bath.

31:31.452 --> 31:32.374
Sounds like a hot lead--

31:32.425 --> 31:33.760
I mean, she was the maid.

31:33.811 --> 31:34.749
No, it wasn't like that--

31:34.800 --> 31:35.878
she was scared of something.

31:35.929 --> 31:37.027
She mentioned the other boy,

31:37.078 --> 31:38.030
she said he was sick.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.901
And she mentioned a doctor.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.994
Tedesco. Dr. Tedesco.

31:42.114 --> 31:43.012
It seemed important.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.146
A name-- now,

31:44.197 --> 31:45.200
that I can work with.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.333
Oh.

31:54.475 --> 31:55.213
Hmm.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.099
Mm!

31:58.382 --> 32:00.483
After a long day of hard work,

32:02.005 --> 32:04.157
I really look forward to a brewski.

32:04.652 --> 32:05.816
Hmm, well, then, my dear,

32:05.867 --> 32:07.780
you are doomed for an evening of disappointment.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.097
A man-- a man with a mask--

32:10.697 --> 32:15.540
came into our house and stole all of our brewskis.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.520
Mm.

32:21.059 --> 32:23.297
So I'm sitting in our $250-

32:23.348 --> 32:30.616
an-hour lawyer's office and I think it's hour three and he says to me,

32:31.049 --> 32:35.266
"Is it true the fellows from Versailles Capital are funding you and Andrew?

32:36.324 --> 32:37.682
" And all I could think of is...

32:38.020 --> 32:39.414
"Versailles is running on fumes."

32:40.044 --> 32:42.281
And I was, like, "I don't know".
I mean, I do know.

32:42.471 --> 32:46.447
At least I strongly suspect based on our conversation this morning.

32:46.615 --> 32:47.581
But I don't know.

32:48.711 --> 32:49.592
So what do you do?

32:50.805 --> 32:52.474
I pretended my phone was vibrating,

32:52.840 --> 32:53.936
that it was a call from you.

32:54.299 --> 32:58.203
I told him I had to wrap up this meeting and I got out of there and I went

32:58.254 --> 32:59.309
over to Andrew's house,

32:59.360 --> 33:00.559
and I just asked him.

33:00.689 --> 33:01.289
And?

33:01.666 --> 33:06.979
And he said, "Keep it under your hat, Joe, but yes,

33:07.498 --> 33:11.485
"Versailles Capital has agreed to provide 100 percent "

33:11.586 --> 33:13.603
of the startup funding for Gossamer.

33:14.795 --> 33:17.469
That's the name we came up with-- Gossamer."

33:18.023 --> 33:19.321
That's a great name.

33:20.295 --> 33:21.891
That's a beautiful name,

33:21.942 --> 33:23.677
my emperor of industry.

33:25.416 --> 33:26.777
So what are you going to do?

33:27.052 --> 33:27.920
I already did it.

33:29.169 --> 33:30.318
I told him I couldn't join him.

33:31.326 --> 33:32.131
Told him I wouldn't.

33:32.803 --> 33:33.997
Did you tell him why?

33:34.907 --> 33:37.875
Did I tell him my dead father told me the money's not going to come through?

33:38.380 --> 33:39.320
No, I didn't.

33:39.611 --> 33:42.142
I don't know why.
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

33:42.384 --> 33:44.921
But, Joe, maybe you could find somebody else to fund you guys.

33:45.547 --> 33:48.664
Maybe... but I already told him.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.477
I'm sure he's out to somebody else by now.

33:55.862 --> 33:57.049
I'm so sorry.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.412
I would've missed the Christmas party.

34:01.319 --> 34:03.112
And my great parking space.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.010
Mm-mm-hmm.

34:04.061 --> 34:06.246
And we do have a hell of a health plan.

34:11.839 --> 34:13.011
You're a liar.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.268
I should get that.
The girls...

34:19.906 --> 34:21.752
Oh! Wait, you just sit. I'll get it.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.342
Hello?

34:27.820 --> 34:29.313
Tracked down this guy Tedesco.

34:29.824 --> 34:31.063
Turns out he's an immunologist,

34:31.114 --> 34:33.670
one of the first pediatric AIDS specialists in Phoenix.

34:34.414 --> 34:37.342
I... I don't understand.

34:37.614 --> 34:39.234
Was Inez's son sick?

34:39.284 --> 34:40.587
D-Did he remember him?

34:40.779 --> 34:41.623
He doesn't remember anything.

34:41.674 --> 34:42.704
He passed away in '86,

34:42.755 --> 34:45.337
but his wife still has all his old medical files in the garage,

34:45.764 --> 34:47.353
and I badgered her and she let me take a look.

34:47.779 --> 34:48.406
And?

34:48.830 --> 34:50.812
And he never treated Tomas,

34:50.862 --> 34:51.475
but get this.

34:51.525 --> 34:52.713
He did treat Jason Morrow.

34:53.329 --> 34:55.601
Turns out Jason's parents were both intravenous drug users,

34:55.652 --> 34:57.364
but only mom got sick.

34:57.417 --> 34:59.317
Apparently she passed AIDS to him in the womb.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.160
According to the file,

35:00.211 --> 35:01.597
Jason's case was terminal.

35:02.297 --> 35:03.335
Life expectancy,

35:03.386 --> 35:04.500
four years, max.

35:04.765 --> 35:06.267
Wait a second, how is that possible?

35:06.318 --> 35:08.369
Jason's got to be at least 25.

35:08.574 --> 35:09.404
Actually, no.

35:09.557 --> 35:11.793
He's not. He's dead.

35:12.346 --> 35:13.612
You led us to his body.

35:15.431 --> 35:17.550
Oh, my God, that little boy in the grave.

35:17.601 --> 35:18.898
Wasn't Inez Soto's son.

35:18.948 --> 35:20.362
Tomas Soto's still alive,

35:20.993 --> 35:23.082
only he thinks he's Jason Morrow.

35:30.688 --> 35:33.007
Mr. Morrow, thank you for coming in on a Saturday, sir.

35:33.936 --> 35:36.307
I'm only here because my son asked me to come down and join him.

35:37.752 --> 35:39.762
He's waiting in the conference room.
Right this way.

35:46.701 --> 35:47.450
Jason.

35:50.127 --> 35:50.836
You all right?

35:51.336 --> 35:51.936
I'm fine.

35:53.562 --> 35:54.688
Why did they bring you down here?

35:54.739 --> 35:55.775
To formally apologize.

35:56.776 --> 35:57.376
Jason,

35:57.334 --> 36:00.025
the city of Phoenix sincerely regrets holding you in connection with the

36:00.076 --> 36:01.214
disappearance of Gloria Soto.

36:01.289 --> 36:05.218
We recognize it as an ordeal and a massive inconvenience and for that,

36:05.269 --> 36:06.273
we sincerely apologize.

36:06.585 --> 36:08.000
Fine. That's a start.

36:08.715 --> 36:10.844
But if you think it's going to make us stop our lawsuit,

36:11.249 --> 36:12.095
you're wrong.

36:12.146 --> 36:13.072
I can assure you,

36:13.303 --> 36:14.870
I'm under no such misapprehension.

36:15.253 --> 36:16.521
Good. Then we'll see you in court.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.001
Probably sooner than you think.

36:19.698 --> 36:20.450
What's this?

36:20.501 --> 36:21.946
It's a medical report on Jason Morrow.

36:21.997 --> 36:24.043
Your son. It dates back to 1982.

36:28.259 --> 36:30.430
You got this from Dr. Michael Tedesco?

36:31.144 --> 36:32.129
His widow, actually.

36:32.556 --> 36:36.253
Imagine Jason's surprise when he heard
that he'd been diagnosed with AIDS at birth.

36:37.878 --> 36:41.407
Seems like the type of thing you'd mention... Dad.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.241
I don't know where you're going with this, Manuel,

36:43.292 --> 36:47.170
but you know damn well that file is protected
under doctor-patient confidentiality.

36:47.221 --> 36:48.141
Absolutely.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.840
But since Jason here is supposedly the patient,

36:51.295 --> 36:52.740
he found the contents fascinating.

36:53.290 --> 36:55.734
I never told you because it wasn't true.

36:55.853 --> 36:57.460
I mean, I fired this doctor.

36:57.511 --> 36:59.357
He misdiagnosed you.

36:59.408 --> 37:01.074
I mean, obviously, look at you, you're fine.

37:01.983 --> 37:03.194
So what was wrong with me?

37:04.052 --> 37:07.054
You suffered from a rare form of pediatric pneumonia.

37:07.278 --> 37:08.738
I took you to a clinic in Switzerland.

37:08.789 --> 37:09.725
You recovered.

37:10.435 --> 37:11.724
And you have documentation to prove that?

37:12.189 --> 37:14.725
My client is not obliged to produce medical records of any kind.

37:14.958 --> 37:16.842
It was very important to you that Jason stay alive,

37:16.893 --> 37:17.577
wasn't it?

37:17.826 --> 37:19.043
Of course. He's my son.

37:19.191 --> 37:19.791
Right.

37:20.060 --> 37:21.294
And after your wife, Emily, passed,

37:21.345 --> 37:23.910
if Jason hadn't survived his bout of-- what'd you callit, "pneumonia"--

37:24.406 --> 37:26.263
you would have been cut out of the family money, wouldn't you?

37:26.773 --> 37:27.509
Mr. District Attorney,

37:27.560 --> 37:28.276
I demand to know,

37:28.327 --> 37:30.157
are you accusing my client of something here?

37:30.546 --> 37:31.411
Only murder.

37:32.452 --> 37:33.182
Two counts for now.

37:33.233 --> 37:35.103
Probably three when all is said and done.

37:35.815 --> 37:36.914
This meeting is over.

37:37.932 --> 37:38.532
Jason.

37:38.495 --> 37:39.649
Sit down, Dad.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.245
Jason, I don't know what they've been telling you,

37:46.296 --> 37:47.729
but it's not true.

37:48.426 --> 37:49.332
David, we should go.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.199
Your wife died of AIDS in 1982.

37:51.556 --> 37:52.977
You knew your son didn't have long to live,

37:53.028 --> 37:55.031
and you knew that when he died,

37:55.139 --> 37:58.124
your last connection to your wife's family money would die with him.

37:58.567 --> 37:59.971
So you did the only thing you could do.

38:00.022 --> 38:01.380
You went looking for a replacement.

38:01.875 --> 38:03.484
And luckily you didn't have to look far.

38:04.134 --> 38:06.545
Your maid's son was about the same age as Jason.

38:07.789 --> 38:09.560
She was an undocumented immigrant,

38:10.113 --> 38:11.558
somebody you thought nobody would miss.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.521
So you killed her.

38:14.873 --> 38:16.543
And then you did something unthinkable.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.482
You killed your own diseased child,

38:20.591 --> 38:25.484
and you raised Inez Soto's healthy boy as your own.

38:29.119 --> 38:29.989
Jason...

38:31.266 --> 38:32.497
none of this is true.

38:32.626 --> 38:34.133
Well, there's a simple way to prove that.

38:34.973 --> 38:36.464
Jason has agreed to give us a blood sample.

38:36.584 --> 38:37.768
If you're willing to do the same,

38:37.879 --> 38:41.366
and the DNA indicates that the two of you are, in fact, related,

38:41.798 --> 38:45.236
then we'll know that all of this was just
a product of our overactive imaginations.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.259
Come on, Dad.

38:52.932 --> 38:53.844
Doesn't even hurt.

38:55.274 --> 38:56.213
At the end of the day,

38:56.604 --> 38:58.361
we can show them how wrong they are.

38:58.412 --> 38:59.229
Manuel,

38:59.347 --> 39:02.513
you know you cannot compel my client to give you a DNA sample.

39:02.614 --> 39:03.431
You're right.

39:03.482 --> 39:07.742
But I can compare the sample I already drew
from Jason to the DNA from Inez Soto's remains.

39:07.793 --> 39:09.715
In fact, it's being done right now.

39:10.985 --> 39:13.270
And if the comparison shows me what I think it's going to--

39:13.343 --> 39:16.432
that the man raised as Jason Morrow is in fact Tomas Soto--

39:17.051 --> 39:19.276
then I'll have more than enough to make a case against your client.

39:20.099 --> 39:21.982
You're welcome to go somewhere and wait it out if you want,

39:22.715 --> 39:24.133
but I'll be on your ass the whole time.

39:24.443 --> 39:26.100
Or we can stay right here and talk about a deal.

39:26.807 --> 39:28.812
Who knows, you tell me where Gloria Soto's body is,

39:29.708 --> 39:32.172
I'll even consider taking the death penalty off the table.

39:37.092 --> 39:37.986
My card's higher.

39:38.563 --> 39:39.337
You sure?

39:40.319 --> 39:41.947
I'm this sure.

39:42.973 --> 39:43.726
I call.

39:48.901 --> 39:49.765
I win!

39:50.478 --> 39:51.408
No, you don't.

39:51.613 --> 39:52.493
I have an ace.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.167
You have a one.

39:56.488 --> 39:57.244
Daddy,

39:57.408 --> 39:59.194
doesn't four beat one?

39:59.489 --> 40:01.500
Sorry, kiddo. Ace beats all.

40:01.824 --> 40:02.453
Ha!

40:03.407 --> 40:05.507
Hey, nobody told me we were having a barbecue.

40:09.775 --> 40:10.434
Hey.

40:10.796 --> 40:11.708
How'd it go?

40:12.372 --> 40:13.789
Well, the father confessed to everything.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.857
He even told us where he buried Gloria Soto.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.495
Congratulations.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.452
Oh, I guess there's good news all around.

40:20.743 --> 40:21.834
I had an interesting call.

40:22.326 --> 40:24.619
It seems they're having a hard time filling Andrew's position,

40:24.670 --> 40:25.578
and guess what?

40:26.695 --> 40:28.485
They want me to interview for the job.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.596
Way to go, Emperor!

40:33.331 --> 40:34.613
I'm going to go change; I'll be right back.

40:35.617 --> 40:36.392
Hey! Hey!

40:42.279 --> 40:44.426
See? Everything works out for the best.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.821
Apparently.

40:48.872 --> 40:49.797
Thanks, I guess.

40:50.329 --> 40:51.680
Ah, one thing, though.

40:52.197 --> 40:54.933
Um, that firm of theirs, that Gossamer thing?

40:56.707 --> 40:58.408
It's actually going to be a success.

40:58.711 --> 41:00.521
It's actually going to do all right.

41:00.572 --> 41:01.591
Not, not huge,

41:01.707 --> 41:03.378
but... all right.

41:04.286 --> 41:07.573
What? I don't understand.

41:07.800 --> 41:12.062
Well, I just didn't want you to see it happen later and get angry with me.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.218
I mean, like I said, everything works out for the best.

41:16.015 --> 41:16.828
Well, wait a second.

41:16.879 --> 41:18.632
Now I'm not so sure it has.

41:18.973 --> 41:21.742
Trust me. If he took that partnership,

41:21.793 --> 41:24.501
he'd spend the next 12 years working 70-hour weeks.

41:25.459 --> 41:27.637
And he'd have told himself that he was doing it for you,

41:28.007 --> 41:28.816
for the kids.

41:29.118 --> 41:32.285
And he wouldn't have known that he was losing you guys until it was too late.

41:34.171 --> 41:35.691
Are you crazy? Lose us?

41:36.481 --> 41:38.620
Joe could never lose us.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.714
Uh, not all at once.

41:41.142 --> 41:42.131
It happens gradually.

41:42.850 --> 41:44.066
Late night by late night,

41:44.218 --> 41:45.201
weekend by weekend.

41:45.891 --> 41:46.801
Before you know it,

41:47.336 --> 41:48.397
you miss a birthday,

41:49.273 --> 41:50.316
then an anniversary.

41:51.062 --> 41:54.203
And then one day your kid is packing up to go to off to college,

41:55.980 --> 41:58.147
and you realize you're saying good-bye to a stranger.

41:58.482 --> 42:00.917
So you thought Joe was going to turn into you?

42:01.449 --> 42:03.983
I knew he was. I saw it.

42:04.954 --> 42:05.828
No, you're wrong.

42:05.879 --> 42:07.014
It wouldn't have happened that way.

42:07.065 --> 42:08.299
Joe is not like you.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.353
And I don't care.

42:10.821 --> 42:12.462
Joe and I are grownups.

42:12.590 --> 42:14.101
We have the right to know the truth.

42:14.678 --> 42:16.322
That was our risk to take.

42:16.726 --> 42:20.370
I don't know. It's 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon.

42:20.725 --> 42:22.665
You're home. He's home.

42:23.127 --> 42:25.049
The burgers are almost ready.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.861
And your little girls have cards stuck to their foreheads.

42:36.295 --> 42:38.614
Days like this-- why would you risk them for anything?

43:12.482 --> 43:16.459
