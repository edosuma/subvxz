ON THE WRONG GUY.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.345
EDDIE DIDN'T TOTAL
YOUR HOUSE. I DID.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.182
YOU?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.383
YOU?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.919
HIM?

12:31.985 --> 12:35.755
CARL! CARL!
CARL! CARL!

12:36.156 --> 12:37.490
WHY?

12:39.592 --> 12:40.861
I DON'T KNOW, CARL.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.296
I GUESS I'M JUST BAD.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.299
BAD TO THE BONE.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.113
WHAT!

13:00.180 --> 13:02.950
YOU KNOW
MY KIND, CARL.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.919
WE LIVE FOR
SPEED, KICKS.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.892
THRILLS AND SPILLS.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.428
DANGER'S
MY MIDDLE NAME.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.629
OH, ACTUALLY,
IT'S QUINCY,

13:16.696 --> 13:19.299
BUT YOU GUYS
GET THE PICTURE.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.301
COME AGAIN?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.371
THANKS. I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D INVITE ME AFTER THIS.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.108
STEVE...

13:28.175 --> 13:29.409
STEVE...

13:29.476 --> 13:31.544
I THINK FOR YOUR SAKE,

13:31.611 --> 13:32.645
YOU--

13:32.712 --> 13:33.680
YOU--

13:33.746 --> 13:35.615
YOU BETTER
GO HOME NOW.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.816
QUICKLY.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.085
YES, SIR.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.322
STEVE. I WILL BE CALLING
YOUR FATHER ON THIS.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.791
OKAY, BUT I
HAVE TO WARN YOU.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.726
MY DAD'S LATEST HOBBY
IS PANTOMIME,

13:46.793 --> 13:50.330
SO IF NO ONE ANSWERS,
IT'S HIM.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.099
GET OUT!

13:53.433 --> 13:55.468
STEVE, WAIT.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.769
YEAH, EDDO?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.505
WHY'D YOU TAKE THE RAP?

13:58.571 --> 14:01.141
A QUICK APPRAISAL OF
THE SITUATION LED ME TO BELIEVE

14:01.208 --> 14:04.244
THAT CARL WAS ABOUT
TO BECOME A HUMAN KRAKATOA.

14:05.913 --> 14:09.716
SO I DECIDED TO BE
THE SACRIFICIAL URKEL.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.451
DAD'S GOING
TO CALL YOUR PARENTS.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.719
WON'T THEY PUNISH YOU?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.554
YEAH, THEY MIGHT
GROUND ME.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.190
THEY MAY EVEN CUT
OFF MY ALLOWANCE.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.961
OOH. THEY MAY EVEN
CANCEL MY BAGPIPE RECITAL.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.265
BUT I CAN
HANDLE IT.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.902
BUT STILL, WHY ARE YOU STICKING
YOUR NECK OUT FOR ME?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.437
BECAUSE WE'RE
BUDDIES, EDDIE.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.473
BUDDIES HELP EACH
OTHER OUT, RIGHT?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.607
YEAH, B-BUT--

14:34.674 --> 14:38.545
YOU'D DO THE SAME
FOR ME, WOULDN'T YOU?

14:41.248 --> 14:41.748
YEAH.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.715
SURE.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.784
I THOUGHT SO.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.554
FAREWELL,
MY WEE BONNIE LASS.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.862
I NEED MORE JUICE.
YOU WANT SOME RICHIE?

14:55.929 --> 14:58.265
THANKS.
BETTER UP.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.886
EDDIE...

15:19.953 --> 15:23.056
YOU HAVE DONE
SOME LOW THINGS,

15:23.123 --> 15:27.560
BUT LETTING STEVE TAKE
THE BLAME IS A NEW HIGH LOW.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.764
I'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY HIS
PARENTS FOR ALL THE DAMAGES.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.267
RELAX.
EVERYTHING'S COOL.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.669
HI, GUYS.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.547
STEVE, WHAT'S
WITH THE UNIFORM?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.449
IT'S MY PUNISHMENT.

15:49.516 --> 15:53.320
WEREN'T YOUR OLD CLOTHES
PUNISHMENT ENOUGH?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.122
NO, SWEETNESS MY
PARENTS HAVE DECIDED

15:55.188 --> 15:57.924
TO SEND ME OFF
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.259
YOU'RE KIDDING.

15:59.326 --> 16:03.296
'TIS NO JEST,
MY FAIR MAIDEN.

16:03.363 --> 16:07.000
I'M AFRAID MOM AND PA WHERE
PUSHED OVER THE EDGE BY THIS.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.870
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY
TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS?

16:10.937 --> 16:12.005
I TRIED.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.606
I BEGGED, I PLEADED,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.542
I MIMED.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.745
BUT I FAILED.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.680
EDDIE, YOU CAN'T
LET THIS HAPPEN.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.583
I KNOW, LAURA,
I KNOW.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.488
I'M AFRAID
IT'S A FAIT ACCOMPLI.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.957
BUT PERHAPS FOUR FRIGHTENING
YEARS OF MILITARY SCHOOL

16:31.024 --> 16:32.759
CAN ACTUALLY
BE BENEFICIAL.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.496
I CAN PUMP UP
THE OLD BOD.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.542
HERE, EDDIE.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.877
A NEW MITT?

16:50.943 --> 16:52.179
I BOUGHT THEM
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

16:52.245 --> 16:54.481
IN THE HOPE THAT
WE COULD PLAY CATCH.

16:54.547 --> 16:58.585
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU WEREN'T ABLE
TO FIT IT INTO YOUR SCHEDULE.

17:00.853 --> 17:05.058
SO NOW I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THEM AS A GOING-AWAY GIFT.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.627
THANKS, STEVE.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.696
LAURA...

17:12.599 --> 17:16.336
WELL, IT'S SO HARD FOR ME
TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOU.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.240
MY HEART
KNOWS THE WORDS.

17:20.307 --> 17:23.143
THEY JUST WON'T
PUMP UP TO MY LIPS.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.651
I GUESS I'M JUST CLOGGED
WITH EMOTIONAL CHOLESTEROL.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.591
WELL, I...
I LOVE YOU, LAURA.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.730
[BLOWS NOISILY]

17:46.333 --> 17:49.169
GOODBYES ARE MURDER
ON THE SINUSES.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.504
STEVE, WAIT HERE.

17:53.072 --> 17:57.410
I HAVE A FEW PRECIOUS MEMENTOS,
I'D LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER ME BY.

17:57.477 --> 18:01.281
I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE MY FIRST
PAIR OF BABY SHOES.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.823
DAD?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.893
YEAH?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.295
YOU BUSY?

18:15.362 --> 18:17.330
JUST BLOWING UP THIS BALLOON
FOR LITTLE RICHIE...

18:17.397 --> 18:19.666
FOR THE LAST
HALF HOUR.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.303
UM, DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT HOLE IN THE LIVING ROOM?

18:24.771 --> 18:28.408
OH. YOU MEAN THE ONE
THE SIZE OF A STATION WAGON?

18:29.509 --> 18:30.810
THAT'S IT.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.080
UH, STEVE DIDN'T
PUT IT THERE.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.782
I DID.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.954
OH?

18:42.021 --> 18:44.224
STEVE WAS COVERING
FOR ME, DAD.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.561
I SEE.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.899
NOW, LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.534
YOU DROVE THE CAR

18:54.601 --> 18:58.104
WITHOUT
A VALID LICENSE...

18:58.171 --> 19:01.641
RIGHT THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR...

19:05.678 --> 19:10.517
AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE
TAKE THE RAP?

19:10.583 --> 19:14.254
DAD, I WAS EMBARRASSED TO
TELL JOLENE I FLUNKED THE TEST.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.323
I DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE HER RESPECT.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.390
INSTEAD, I'VE
REALLY MESSED UP,

19:17.457 --> 19:21.928
AND NOW
I'VE LOST YOURS.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.463
EDWARD.

19:23.530 --> 19:27.066
EDWARD JAMES
ARTHUR WINSLOW...

19:27.133 --> 19:30.703
SON, YOU HAVEN'T
LOST MY RESPECT.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.640
MESSING UP IS
A PART OF GROWING UP.

19:33.706 --> 19:37.544
EDWARD, IT'S A PROCESS
THAT NEVER ENDS.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.846
ACTUALLY, I THINK
I MESSED UP, TOO.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.617
HOW?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.219
WELL, I...

19:46.286 --> 19:49.356
I DON'T THINK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN YOU THAT LAST-MINUTE TEST.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.759
I WANTED TO HELP, BUT I
THINK I SHOOK YOU UP INSTEAD.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.962
AND I'M SORRY.

19:56.028 --> 20:01.033
WELL, I GUESS WE CAN
BOTH LEARN FROM THIS.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.635
THANKS, DAD.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.537
GOOD TALK.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.506
EDWARD.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.342
I'M THE FATHER.
I LEARN FROM THIS.

20:09.409 --> 20:13.613
YOU'RE THE SON. YOU LEARN
FROM THIS AND YOUGET PUNISHED.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.484
OKAY. WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE?

20:17.550 --> 20:21.220
YOU'RE GROUNDED
FOR ONE MONTH,

20:21.288 --> 20:22.555
PLUS YOU'LL
HAVE WAIT TWO MONTHS

20:22.622 --> 20:24.557
BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR NEXT DRIVER'S TEST.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.759
TWO MONTHS?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.028
THAT'S FAIR.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.765
AND I ALSO WANT YOU TO TELL
STEVE'S PARENTS WHAT HAPPENED,

20:32.832 --> 20:35.468
THEN YOU'LL DO ODD
JOBS AROUND THE HOUSE

20:35.535 --> 20:38.438
UNTIL EVERY CENT OF
THE DAMAGES ARE PAID OFF.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.872
AT $4.00 AN HOUR,

20:39.939 --> 20:42.975
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE YOU MORE
THAN TWO, THREE YEARS, TOPS.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.979
DAD, DOESN'T IT COUNT
THAT I DID COME

20:47.046 --> 20:49.316
AND TELL THE TRUTH?

20:50.216 --> 20:52.685
OKAY. $4.10 AN HOUR.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.095
AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST,

21:03.162 --> 21:05.965
A JAR OF MOM'S
HOMEMADE CATFISH JAM.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.837
BONELESS.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.808
GEE, STEVE...

21:15.875 --> 21:16.843
YOUR BABY SHOES...

21:16.909 --> 21:20.012
YOUR
GRANDMOTHER'S DENTURES...

21:20.079 --> 21:22.148
FISH JAM...

21:22.214 --> 21:24.016
AND I DIDN'T GET
A THING FOR YOU.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.589
UM, STEVE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.659
OH, FINE.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.994
I'LL GO PUT THESE
DENTURES IN SOME WATER.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.968
STEVE, YOU WON'T
NEED THAT UNIFORM.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.070
I TOLD MY DAD
THE TRUTH.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.905
WOW! THANKS, EDDIE!

21:45.972 --> 21:48.575
I WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.679
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THEY
DON'T ALLOW NIGHT LIGHTS.

21:53.913 --> 21:54.814
LISTEN, STEVE,

21:54.881 --> 21:56.516
YOU PUT YOURSELF
ON THE LINE FOR ME.

21:56.583 --> 21:59.218
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, MAN.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.053
HEY, ANY TIME, DUDE.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.491
I'M YOUR BUDDY, AND BUDDIES
STICK BY EACH OTHER.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.658
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
BUDDIES DO?

22:05.725 --> 22:06.959
WHAT?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.695
THEY PLAY CATCH.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.297
LET'S BREAK
THAT PUPPY IN.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.699
ALRIGHT!

22:14.300 --> 22:16.603
THINK FAST!

22:18.270 --> 22:20.707
WHAT HAPPENED!

22:24.076 --> 22:27.814
SORRY!
I BROKE A LAMP, DAD.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.950
GEE, THANKS FOR
COVERING FOR ME, EDDIE.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.885
WE'RE BUDDIES,
RIGHT?
