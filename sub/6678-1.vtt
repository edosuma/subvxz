No. We ain't stopping the car again.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.907
We don't wanna stop.
We want to know, are we good boys?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.867
Yeah, yeah, you're good boys.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.495
All right, Toby, give them a piece of candy.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.707
Thank you.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.847
Yeah.

You ain't gonna use that road, are you, Pop?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.245
Why not?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.997
Well, that sign says "closed to the public."

03:25.080 --> 03:27.207
We ain't the public,
we're part of the government.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.836
They send me checks.
I keep them busy and happy.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.838
We're dependent on each other.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.756
We ain't the public, Toby.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.114
Damn it, I lost my traction.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.866
Don't get upset, Pa, I'll lift her off.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.451
You'll do nothing of the kind.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.244
You're getting $63.80 a month

04:04.369 --> 04:06.496
because the Army
totally disabled your back.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.332
Now, how's it gonna look
if somebody comes along

04:08.415 --> 04:09.708
and you're lifting up an automobile?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.168
My back don't feel totally disabled.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
It don't matter how your back feels,

04:13.170 --> 04:15.464
it's what the Army doctor says that counts.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.714
I keep telling you, Pop,

04:16.798 --> 04:18.966
they examined me
right after my first judo lesson.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.845
It was a little twisted up,
but it twisted back the next lesson.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.181
- Toby, we'll get out.
- That's okay.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.785
Didn't twist your back again, did you, son?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.286
No, sir, I just used mostly my hands.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.371
Good. Good.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.623
I wonder where the road goes.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.334
It's hard to tell,
just from looking at one end.

(TOBY WHISTLING)

05:04.346 --> 05:05.472
Hey,POP?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.807
Yeah, Holly?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.725
Listen, I've been taking notice.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.394
We haven't passed a house

05:10.477 --> 05:13.313
or even a gas station the whole time
we've been on this road.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.191
Well, it stands to reason.
It's a brand new road.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.819
The country ain't caught up with it yet.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.613
Doesn't your gas gauge read "empty"?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.741
When my gas gauge says "empty,"

05:24.825 --> 05:26.618
it's still got three gallons left in it.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.830
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

05:48.181 --> 05:50.142
I can't understand it.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.102
Where you going, son?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.104
I'm gonna jog up the highway
and get some gasoline.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.313
You gonna do nothing of the kind.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.440
Why not?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.316
One of those government
Highway Patrol wagons

05:58.400 --> 05:59.734
is gonna come along here any minute.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.738
Now, Pop, there won't be any patrolling
if this road doesn't go anywhere.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.574
And why wouldn't this road
wanna go nowhere?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.452
Maybe the government ran out of money
before they could finish it.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.913
How many times do I have to tell you that
the government don't run out of money?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.832
Only people run out of money.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.208
Government's loaded.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.211
Wake me up
when that truck patrols by here.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.713
All right, Pop.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.553
Gee, Toby, it's gonna be
getting dark in a couple of hours.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.847
I don't see how we can prevent it.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.683
I'm awful thirsty.
So are the children.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.730
I'm sorry, Holly, but I don't happen to have
any drinking water on me right now.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.900
I wonder what's keeping that patrol car?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.946
- Toby.
- Yeah?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.616
We could dig for some.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.826
Well, there's always what you call
ground water,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.620
and it doesn't mix with the salt water

06:51.745 --> 06:54.581
so if you dig down to the water level,
you can get the fresh.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.542
Well, another thing
I don't have on me is a shovel.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.461
Why, it's soft ground.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.838
All you need is sort of a scoop or something.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.050
There ought to be something around here
we could use.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.052
What about this?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.137
No, not your pop's fender.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.640
Oh, I'll put it back on before he wakes up.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.319
TEDDY: I hit one.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.946
- EDDY: You did not.
- I did so.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.907
All right now, just keep throwing.
We need more coconuts.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.077
Higher. Higher. That's good.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.412
Higher. Higher.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.122
EDDY: Hey, Pop, do you wanna try one?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.958
POP: No, I don't wanna try one.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.584
Keep hitting higher.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.586
Here you go, Ariadne.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.424
You're just as happy
as a house cat, ain't you?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.053
Women like doing things for other people.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.930
Don't men ever feel like that?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.015
(CHUCKLES)

07:54.975 --> 07:56.643
What did I say that was so funny?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.144
Oh, nothing.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.106
I was just remembering,
after your folks died,

08:01.189 --> 08:02.816
when Pop took you in.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.653
What a skinny, scrawny little thing
you were.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.489
All eyes and elbows.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.326
And now you're practically...

08:13.660 --> 08:15.829
Well, like you said,
practically a woman.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.166
- Toby.
- Yeah?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.502
Will you look at me?

08:23.461 --> 08:24.713
Mmm-hmm.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.174
No, I mean real good.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.015
I know you're a woman, Holly.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.644
And I know I said "practically,"
and that bothers you, don't it?

08:41.187 --> 08:44.357
Yeah, well, I am 19 years old

08:44.691 --> 08:46.484
and I'm kind of well-built.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.361
Yep, I know that, too.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.530
And I'm glad of it.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.908
- Are you, Toby?
- Uh-huh.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.036
'Cause I'm trying
not to notice things like that

08:56.161 --> 08:58.663
and you're a good one to practice
not noticing on.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.333
Well, why me,

09:01.708 --> 09:04.085
and, well, what's wrong with noticing girls?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.087
Well, that's how they catch you.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.591
Pop told me all about it
the day I got sent home from band practice

09:09.716 --> 09:12.844
for grabbing Amy Plotka.
Do you remember Amy?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.430
Yeah, I remember Amy.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.726
You know anything about sex, Holly?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.729
Of course I do.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.898
Who told you?

09:26.858 --> 09:28.276
I don't remember.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.737
Never you mind.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.074
You've been living with us since you was 13.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.493
You know about it then?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.536
Oh, Toby, leave me alone.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.039
I'm sorry, honey,
I didn't aim to make you mad.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.874
I was just trying to explain
what you asked me.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.460
Well, then explain.
Don't ask questions.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.589
Well, it's just like Pop said,
women are natural nesters.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.009
Just look at the way
you took to nesting right here.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.304
Cooking dinner and everything,
starting from scratch.

09:57.555 --> 10:01.142
Well, I would dearly love to know
what's so awful about nesting?

10:02.060 --> 10:04.813
It's just being married
and having a house.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.272
Well, nothing.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.608
Except doing it when you don't want to.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.112
I think a man ought to be allowed
to wait till he wants to.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.572
Women don't aim to let you wait.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.368
That's why I use my education
against them.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.994
Your education?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.788
Multiplication tables.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.083
Anytime some pretty gal
is standing around bothering me

10:25.166 --> 10:28.002
I just close my eyes and I say,
one times one is one,

10:28.128 --> 10:31.172
and one times two is two
and right on through the eights.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.635
Most times I only have to get to the sixes
and they get disgusted and go away.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.011
I can imagine.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.597
Of course it don't do much good
if they hang on through the eights

10:39.681 --> 10:41.641
'cause I forget the nineses.

10:42.100 --> 10:46.062
That's what happened that night
behind the bowling alley with Gertrude.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.814
I forgot the nineses.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.360
<i>1 ob'! ,</i>

10:54.946 --> 10:59.951
when you say that you wanna wait,
do you want to?

11:01.703 --> 11:04.581
Does that mean that
you don't wanna fall in love?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.541
Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.418
Not me.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.005
Notjudging from the kind of love
I've seen people fall into.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.883
Pop had a song that explained it pretty well.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.677
Let me see, how did that thing go?

11:22.515 --> 11:27.061
<i>Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek</i>

<i>And I'll show you a girl</i>

Come on, Ariadne.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.221
The governor is scheduled to start
from the Coast Highway at 11:00.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.473
I'd hate to miss the dedication.

13:27.599 --> 13:31.519
You certainly got a right to be
mighty proud of this project, Mr. King.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.482
Not a tin can or a gum wrapper
along the whole 30 miles.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.824
Stop. Stop, quick!

(TEDDY AND EDDY IMITATING GUNFIRE)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.628
What in the name of...

13:58.171 --> 14:00.214
What's going on here?

14:01.299 --> 14:03.259
I reckon you're from the government

14:03.343 --> 14:05.219
and I will say it's about time.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.264
I am the State Supervisor of Highways

14:08.348 --> 14:10.558
and I wanna know what you're doing here?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.769
You see, we ran out of gas here on this road.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.980
Don't give me that stuff.
You've been camping here.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.815
Well, we couldn't camp nowhere else,

14:17.899 --> 14:19.984
because this is where we ran out of gas.

14:20.068 --> 14:25.073
I think you're within 50 feet
of the center line of that road.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.533
That means that legally speaking,

14:27.617 --> 14:29.202
you're on the thoroughfare.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.205
You could be arrested
for obstructing traffic.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.832
I don't see any jam up here.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.417
That doesn't matter.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.587
You can't just camp on
a public thoroughfare as if you owned it.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.881
The way you're talking about it,
you'd think you owned it.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.886
I am ordering you to pack yourjunk
in that jalopy and clear out.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.055
On foot, huh?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.475
You claim you're out of gas, do you?

14:52.558 --> 14:53.768
Yes, sir.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.522
And I'm mighty near out of patience
with this kind of government.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.733
Joe, break out that spare can of gas.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.112
I want your name and address.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.072
You're gonna be billed for it.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.743
We're the Kwimpers from Cranberry County,
just over the state line.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.038
Just care of the county,
they always know where to find us.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.415
You're his son?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.541
That's right.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.961
And she is your wife
and those are your children?

15:22.046 --> 15:24.924
No, sir. Me and Pop, we're the Kwimpers.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.469
Teddy and Eddy,
sitting over there on that car,

15:28.594 --> 15:31.472
they're some sort of fourth cousins
or something.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.434
After their folks died,
we just sort of took them in.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.810
They don't cost us much, though,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.855
on account of we collect aid
for dependent children.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.190
That teenager there, she's Holly Jones.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.859
She used to be our babysitter.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.902
Her folks got killed in an auto accident.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.904
She just stayed with us ever since.

15:46.988 --> 15:50.783
And that little girl,
she was orphaned just last year.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.036
She's just three years old
and her name's Ariadne.

15:53.119 --> 15:57.832
All right, all right.
You're a self-appointed orphanage.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.252
Now, will you kindly get this mess loaded?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.628
Yes, sir. I was just trying to...

16:02.754 --> 16:04.088
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.800
He can't load nothing.
He's on total disability for a bad back.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.971
- Oh, Pop.
- Total disability?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.932
What do you collect?
Unemployment compensation?

16:15.016 --> 16:16.601
Well, relief is a...

16:16.684 --> 16:18.478
Lately, he's been favoring relief.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.605
All wards of the government?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.399
Well, look here,
in 15 minutes the Governor of this state

16:23.483 --> 16:25.610
is gonna drive along this road
and dedicate it.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.404
And he's not going to be looking
at any mess like this.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.572
Yes, sir.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.034
I don't know why
I should explain anything to you.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.036
But this road...

16:35.369 --> 16:39.165
This road is part
of a big public betterment program.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.250
Over there,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.669
we'll have a bird sanctuary.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.671
- That'll be nice.
- Yeah.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.424
Back there, a wildlife preserve.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.259
That'll be nice, too.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.469
JOE: Mr. King,

16:52.970 --> 16:54.639
here come a bunch of cars,
it must be the governor.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.890
(SIRENS WAILING)

16:56.015 --> 16:59.352
Oh, no! He's early.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.728
Well, I got the gasoline.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.480
Never mind about the gas,

17:02.563 --> 17:04.272
let's get this place cleaned up.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.608
Just a moment.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.154
You must be insane.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.907
You said yourself, the public thoroughfare
is 50 feet from the center line.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.451
Well, the 50 feet ends right there.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.661
Teddy and Eddyjust measured it.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.246
- Right, boys?
- BOTH: Right!

17:19.247 --> 17:23.000
Back! Back! Back!

17:23.416 --> 17:25.044
What's it matter where it ends?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.380
This is State property, you idiot.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.048
This is private property.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.555
Oh, no. He's stopping.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.898
Mr. King,
what seems to be the trouble here?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.609
Governor, Your Excellency, I'm very sorry,

17:48.734 --> 17:51.195
but these people are obstructing
a public thoroughfare.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.573
We'll get rid of them right away,
Your Excellency.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.242
Trooper... Sergeant, arrest these people.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.494
- Good morning, Governor.
- Yes, sir.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.706
Morning, sir. Mr. Governor,
if you appointed this man

18:01.789 --> 18:05.126
I think it best you get out of the car
right now and put him straight.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.044
A man like you has got to know the law,

18:07.128 --> 18:09.046
and it's on the record now.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.091
You'll witness his violation
of a citizen's rights.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.972
Are you a student of the law, sir?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
A student? Why...

18:20.600 --> 18:23.102
Well, I know that the police
can't come on private property

18:23.227 --> 18:26.022
unless they's got a warrant
or is chasing people.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.024
Now, nobody can chase us.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.734
On account of we ain't running.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.196
So it's best they get off that
private property, right, Governor? Right?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.698
- Well...
- Sir, it's not private property,

18:35.781 --> 18:38.743
it's filled land.
Put there by the Highway Division.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.203
Well, you know what the law states

18:40.286 --> 18:41.913
about homesteading, don't you, Governor?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.707
Well, we're homesteading
from the end of the thoroughfare

18:44.790 --> 18:46.375
to the edge of the river.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.128
Oh, homesteaders, eh?

18:50.671 --> 18:52.506
Homesteaders!

18:53.966 --> 18:56.010
Any public land can be homesteaded,
can't it?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.805
Yes, sir. If they put up a roof and stay on it
for six months, they own it.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.808
The boy's right, Governor.
Well, there's the roof.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.940
They're on private property.
Would you get back a mite?

19:09.023 --> 19:11.234
- They're trespassing.
- All right, officers, get off.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.321
Respect private property at all times,
gentlemen, that's the law.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.366
Well, justice has been rendered.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.118
I'll see you later, Mr. King.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.621
Let's move along.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.332
- Take care of yourself, Governor.
- Thank you, sir.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.836
Nice parade.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.547
He's a nice fellow.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.761
Give three cheers for Pop.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

19:38.844 --> 19:40.054
Stop that, you brats.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.098
- Brats.
- Who you calling brats?

19:42.181 --> 19:45.101
I'll take care of it.
Run along and play, kids.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.560
You gonna stand on our property

19:46.686 --> 19:48.938
and you're gonna give orders
like you're entitled to?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.942
That's a good idea.
Play it up while you've got the chance.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.860
Oh, yes, there's a homestead law,

19:54.944 --> 19:57.238
and you've taken good advantage of it.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.156
But there's other laws, Kwimper,

19:59.240 --> 20:02.201
laws that might cause you
a lot of unpleasantness.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.953
Such as? Go ahead, quote them.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.539
One, for instance, provides that none of you

20:06.664 --> 20:10.376
receive any more welfare benefits
from your home state.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.837
You're residents here now.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.131
I shall so notify the proper authorities.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.257
Pop.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.426
Pop, do you want me to throw this fellow
off our property?

20:18.551 --> 20:21.053
No, no, no, just leave him be.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.888
We'll listen and we'll learn.

20:23.097 --> 20:27.727
Learn this, too, then.
That well is probably unhygienic.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.023
That lean-to doesn't conform
to any zoning restriction I know of.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.108
Kwimper, I am proud of my job

20:34.191 --> 20:36.277
and of my responsibility to the people.

20:36.402 --> 20:40.114
I owe them my best efforts
to run your sort out of this area.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.410
You'll be hearing from me shortly.
Come along, Joe.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.331
Funny thing.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.625
I was just about to give him back his land
when he turned nasty.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.586
Now, I don't know what to do.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.840
Pop, didn't you mean what you said
about homesteading and all?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.800
But, damn it, I ought to stay here.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.596
But it's an awful lot of botherjust to take
that uppity hyena down a peg.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.723
- I gotta think it over, Tob.
- Well, Pop...

21:05.806 --> 21:07.600
I gotta think it over, Tob.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.811
Toby. Cross your fingers and pray.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.648
Pray for what, Holly?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.609
To homestead!

21:16.984 --> 21:19.779
To stay here.
To stay here for always.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.323
Why, that don't make a bit of sense to me.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.033
What's wrong with our own home?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.993
After Gertrude Patterson leaves, that is.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.621
Well, it's not our home, it's your home.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.957
But if we built a place here,

21:33.167 --> 21:34.710
it would really be part mine,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.797
and not just a place
I was allowed to move into.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.758
Be my first real home.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.764
I'm sorry, Toby,
if that sounds ungrateful.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.268
That's natural, honey,
I mean, women are just natural nesters,

21:51.352 --> 21:53.312
just like Pop said.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.316
Toby, a body would think a grown man

21:57.400 --> 21:59.443
could make up his own mind about things.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.195
Well, I agree with you there.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.197
I kind of like to make my own decisions, too,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.991
but I usually wind up doing
what Pop wants anyway.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.497
Don't you understand that I wanna stay?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.958
I wanna stay so much.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.130
I didn't realize it meant
that much to you, honey.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.508
Just don't get upset about it. I'll fix it.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.801
How?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.888
You mean, you haven't learnt how to handle
a contrary man like Pop yet?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.723
Watch this. Hey, Pop!

22:32.017 --> 22:33.310
Pop!

22:33.394 --> 22:34.979
Huh? Huh? Huh?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.231
We'd better get out of here.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.399
Who says?

22:38.482 --> 22:41.277
That King fellow is gonna make
an awful lot of trouble.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.904
<i>I'l</i> l break him off like a dry twig.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.031
Well, maybe so, maybe not.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.241
No maybe about it.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.118
Well, it's just that me and Holly here,

22:49.201 --> 22:50.578
we don't think you can handle a man

22:50.661 --> 22:53.205
as big and powerful
as a highway supervisor.

22:54.748 --> 22:58.127
Well, that settles it.
We're staying.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.088
We're homesteading.
We ain't leaving here until I say so.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.216
But, Pop, why,
how can we possibly manage?

23:04.341 --> 23:06.510
How will we manage?
That's my department.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.137
I'll take care of the brainwork.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.348
You young folks,
you take care of the work work.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.894
Toby...

23:16.061 --> 23:18.272
Toby, I could kiss you for that.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.570
One times one is one.
One times two is two...

23:29.450 --> 23:32.077
Wow! That's a monster.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.331
Is it good to eat?

23:35.414 --> 23:39.084
We ain't never gonna know.
He's too big to handle for this gear.

23:51.639 --> 23:52.890
What do you got there, a tarpon?

23:52.973 --> 23:55.351
I don't know,
but whatever it is, it's a whopper.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.436
He's too big to catch with a diaper pin.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.521
I'm trying to get rid of him

23:58.604 --> 24:00.231
just as much as he's trying to get rid of me.

24:00.314 --> 24:01.815
Trying to get rid of him?

24:01.941 --> 24:05.027
I've been paying $65 a day for charter boats
and never hooked one like that.

Hi, son.

- Get all the shopping done?
- I think so.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.972
Did you have enough money for everything?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.975
Yep, and a couple of luxury items, too.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.520
I went to a junkyard and I bought us a john.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.447
I bought some cheap lumber, too.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.200
I'm gonna build it its own little house.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.910
Is that a telegram, Pop?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.745
Yeah, from the government back home.

getting us cutoff.

We'll manage.

Did you see the size of that one?

25:36.994 --> 25:38.662

25:38.746 --> 25:40.497
It wasn't much of a hook though,

25:40.581 --> 25:42.416
it was just a diaper pin, that's all it was.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.419
A diaper pin, a pole, and a piece of string,

25:45.544 --> 25:48.464
and I had more action
than with $1,000 worth of equipment.

25:48.547 --> 25:52.551
Oh. Nope. Here's your $20.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.721
No, I couldn't take that.
All I done was lend you a fish

Oh, you was right, Pop.
I was wrong.

You know, we'd better start a bank account.

I've had nothing to do with no banks,
I ain't gonna start now.

28:38.175 --> 28:42.513

and you double your money before you...

28:42.888 --> 28:44.515

I mean, I'm gonna make
a few improvements.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.027
Lots, Pop.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.905
What we first need
is a line of pilings offshore.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.323
We do?

29:01.406 --> 29:02.699
So we can build a dock.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.076
A dock?

29:04.201 --> 29:07.120
Let me handle this, Pop,
I understand her a little better than you do.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.081
Now, what do we need a dock for, honey?

29:09.206 --> 29:11.667
Silly, so we can tie up our rowboats.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.210
Oh, rowboats.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.755
We need a rowboat
so we can row out to our yacht, Pop.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.092
Else how can we get out to that island
where our hotel is?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.678
Now, will you two stop that?
I mean this.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.223
We need rowboats so we can
rent them out to our fishing parties.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.767
Right now,
our customers are fishing off of that bridge

29:28.892 --> 29:31.144
and it belongs to the state highway.

29:31.395 --> 29:35.107
Now how long is it before that Mr. King
is gonna put a stop to it?

29:35.315 --> 29:37.526
- Be damned, but she's right.
- She is?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.319
Well, of course I am.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.946
So I talked to some folks,

29:41.071 --> 29:43.699
and it figures out
we can get some used rowboats,

29:43.782 --> 29:48.161
build a dock, and have
a real fishing place for about $2,000.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.705
POP: $2,000?

29:51.456 --> 29:53.625
No, I've been asking around.

29:53.750 --> 29:57.170
There's a very good chance
we can borrow the money from the bank.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.882
Well, that would sure change
my opinion about banks.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.551
You mean they'll lend you
the moneyjust for the asking of it?

30:02.634 --> 30:04.011
And the interest.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.972
You gotta pay them back a little more
than they pay out.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.140
Oh!

30:08.599 --> 30:10.475
That's how they do it.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.436
Yeah, Pop.

30:12.936 --> 30:16.857
Well, will you go?
Will you go to the bank and borrow $2,000?

30:16.982 --> 30:18.567
Well, if it's that easy, let Toby do it.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.693

got my own fleet of rowboats,
my own docks,

30:24.031 --> 30:25.365
all because I wouldn't
let some government man

30:25.449 --> 30:27.826
tell me where I could stand
and where I couldn't.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.412

in not doing what you're told, Pop.

Yes, sir. Teddy, Eddy,
let that learn you.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.375

never do what you're told.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.753
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
don't tell them a thing like that.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.756

Are you all right, sir?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.943
I don't know, I...
Who are you?

36:35.235 --> 36:36.444
A friend of mine.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.989
He runs that fishing place
out on the new highway.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.700
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
lthoughtyouu.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.910
All right, guard,
open up the doors, please.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.120
It's all right, folks.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.538
Nothing to be frightened about.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.040
Just a mistake, everything will be all right.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.458
Toby, are you all right?

36:50.542 --> 36:52.210
Yeah, I'm all right, Holly.
I'm all right.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.378
Hello, Mr. Endicott.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.504
Hello, dear.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.798
Well, maybe you can
tell me what this is all about?

36:56.881 --> 36:58.967
I don't know.
ltjust seemed to happen all at once.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.719
Well, Mr. Binkley yelled for help and...

37:00.802 --> 37:01.970
No, I didn't.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.972
George, remember you're a vice president.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.932
Please get off the depositors' table.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.018
Well, I didn't yell for help.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.185
Toby did.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.520
Well, I thought he was sick.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.564
This man broke into the bank vault...

37:12.689 --> 37:14.816
I understand, guard.
Here's your gun.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.318
Just go about your business.

37:16.401 --> 37:17.694
Yes, sir.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.905
Well, let's get down to fundamentals.

37:21.239 --> 37:25.076
Now, young lady, what are you
and this gentleman doing in our little bank?

37:25.201 --> 37:27.245
We want to borrow $2,000.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.247
Please.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.459
Well, you went to the right person.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.878
George here is our loan officer.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.088
Could we have the money right now, sir?

37:37.213 --> 37:39.591
You see, the parking meter
is running outside...

37:39.716 --> 37:43.219
Well, Toby,
we don't do things quite that fast here.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.972
Why don't we come to my office?

37:46.097 --> 37:48.516
I think George needs to sit down.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.602
Well, come along.
Come along, George.

37:53.938 --> 37:57.859
So if we can get the dock
and the boats and the outboard motors,

37:57.942 --> 38:01.738
we could rent them,
make a lot of money, and build a house.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.616
Well, George here is the man
you're gonna have to convince.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.201
You frightened him to death,

38:06.284 --> 38:08.286
now it's his turn to frighten you.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.791
Mr. Kwimper, the bank must have security,

38:12.916 --> 38:16.669
well, that is to say that we have to be sure
that we'll get our money back.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.129
Now, this is Mrs. Kwimper?

38:18.671 --> 38:20.465
Oh, no, sir. She just lives with me.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.926
Oh.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.345
Well, I didn't mean to pry.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.640
I think you're getting
the wrong impression, George.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.267
How long have you lived
with the Kwimpers?

38:31.351 --> 38:35.063
Since I've been about 13.
Toby's Pop took me in

38:35.146 --> 38:38.149
for the same reason he took in
Ariadne and the twins.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.526
We had no place to go.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.737
Get the picture, George?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.114
Oh, thank you.

38:44.197 --> 38:47.909
Yes. Yes, sir.
Now, this land that you're living on,

38:47.992 --> 38:50.036
well, is it mortgaged?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.247
I don't know, sir.
We don't own it.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.165
We're homesteading.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.459
Well, we can't very well lend you money

38:56.543 --> 38:58.711
on property you don't own yet.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.463
Well, we own ourjohn.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.883
I didn't quite catch that.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.513
Ourjohn, and I guess we own the house
that we built for it, too.

39:09.722 --> 39:13.768
Yes. Well, let's move on here, shall we?

39:13.852 --> 39:16.062
Now, how about your car?

39:16.563 --> 39:20.525
Well, that car means an awful lot to Pop
even though it only cost $50.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.986
Besides, it's got fried hubcaps.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.281
Of course.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.242
Well, George, you've got to admit
he's been giving you honest answers,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.202
not cagey ones, but honest.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.622
A week ago
he refused to take $20 for a public fish.

39:34.706 --> 39:38.251
That's very commendable.
I think that... How is that?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.170
It doesn't really matter.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.047
I happen to have
a very high opinion of honesty.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.925
Well, yes, sir, of course.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.510
But is it security?

39:49.512 --> 39:53.266
It just might be that this is
the only real security there is.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.687
Well, sir, I became
a vice president of this bank

39:57.770 --> 40:01.065
because I made it a habit
never to contradict the boss.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.030
This bank is about to lend you $2,000.

40:08.364 --> 40:12.035
We're very grateful, sir,
but I don't want to try to fool anybody.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.829
Now that car of Pop's is in a terrible mess.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.206
It doesn't matter, Toby.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.958
What we're making is known
as a character loan.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.129
We do it now and then, but not
often enough for the good of our souls.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.424
Don't you agree, George?

40:26.508 --> 40:28.968
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Yes, sir.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.431
Well, nice having done
business with you, Toby.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.599
Thank you, Mr. Endicott.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.267
- And you, Holly.
- Thank you, sir.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.400
- Oh, Mr. King.
- Yes?

40:44.484 --> 40:46.110
Miss Claypoole's office just called.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.862
She has your memo
and she can see you now.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.822
Good. Call her back
and tell her <i>I'l</i> l be right there.

40:49.948 --> 40:50.990
Yes, sir.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.117
(CHATTERING QUIETLY)

40:59.249 --> 41:01.876
Well, I gather you don't think
highly of these Kwimper people.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.128
You gather good.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.757
They sound half hillbilly, half hobo to me.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.844
With a tincture of Bowery burn
and possibly wino.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.682
Well, Arthur,
if this memo of yours is correct,

41:15.765 --> 41:16.891
this is a case for the police,

41:16.975 --> 41:18.476
not for Social Welfare.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.187
Does the memo imply
they've broken the law?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.940
I don't recall making any such statement.

41:24.148 --> 41:28.528
Well, it says, "A social contagion
that aims its poison of indifference

41:29.612 --> 41:32.490
"and sloth at the soul
of our social structure."

41:33.616 --> 41:35.410
Well, is that funny?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.120
No.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.872
Sorry, Arthur,
you do get a bit stuffy when you get angry.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.042
Yes, Alisha, when a few parasitic individuals

41:43.167 --> 41:44.544
set themselves above the interests

41:44.669 --> 41:48.339
of six million taxpayers, I get angry,
and stuffy, and determined!

41:51.009 --> 41:53.678
Well, if these people
are what you represent,

41:53.803 --> 41:57.015
the State Welfare can
make them want to be someplace else.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.435
But I'm afraid I can't take your word for it,
I'll have to interview them.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.188
Alisha, how dare you imply
I'd misrepresent this situation?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.108
Arthur, keep your shirt on.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.402
You've already admitted you were angry.

42:09.986 --> 42:14.032
Now what Welfare Officer would take the
recommendations of an angry man, hmm?

42:14.657 --> 42:17.452
And remember,
I didn't take this job for livelihood.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.745
I enjoy my work.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.832
I must say, interviewing the Kwimpers
does look like a lot of fun.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.718
Good morning, Holly.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.136
Good morning, folks.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.721

comes along once in a lifetime.

47:23.007 --> 47:26.260
Carmine, you know this could turn out
to be an East Coast Las Vegas.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.638
Oh, you mean
because there's no police here?

47:28.721 --> 47:30.097
Now you're digging it, little lady.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.224
Yes, but what about after we file?

47:32.350 --> 47:34.060
- File what?
- Our claim.

47:34.185 --> 47:37.063
Once we've lived here for six months,
we can claim the land.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.815
Pop says that it'll be part of the county then.

47:39.899 --> 47:43.069
Well, this land claiming idea
don't sound too good.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.363
Now, I bet it would
if Pop explained it to you.

47:45.488 --> 47:48.532
Yeah, well, where is he?
In that woodpile next door?

47:48.741 --> 47:51.410
Well, he wasn't in the woodpile
when we left. He was...

47:51.535 --> 47:54.580
Well, let's visit him anyway.
After you, please.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.082
Thank you, sir.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.583
(CHUCKUNG)

47:59.085 --> 48:00.962
Oh, baby, is this a sweet deal?

48:01.045 --> 48:03.714
Carmine, nobody's gonna mess it up.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.967
You're not planning any rough stuff?

48:06.050 --> 48:08.010
We do it nice if we can.

48:11.013 --> 48:14.183
Now, your kid here tells me
you're gonna put in a claim for this land?

48:14.266 --> 48:15.977
That's about the size of it.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.313
Well, that would be a big mistake.
Bring the cops here.

48:19.397 --> 48:22.441
Right nice of you to warn us
but I know all about it.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.903
Well, I like to do things nice if I can.

48:27.279 --> 48:31.450
Now there's $2,000.
Carmine and me want to buy your place.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.035
Oh, no, you can't...

48:33.119 --> 48:34.704
We ain't gonna sell.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.541
We got $2,000 in this
without counting the brainwork.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.628
All right, <i>I'l</i> l make it $5,000 and the
government will give you capital gains.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.255
Don't mention the government to me.

48:44.380 --> 48:47.049
I tried to help the government out
with everything they wanted to do.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.136
With relief, with compensation,
with disability.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.429
They cut me off.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.014
Well, if that's the way they feel about it,

48:53.097 --> 48:55.599
don't mention the government to me.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.060
(SIGHS)

48:58.144 --> 48:59.729
He's your father?

48:59.812 --> 49:00.855
That's my POP-

49:00.938 --> 49:02.523
Sure, that figures.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.818
All right, <i>I'l</i> l go a little higher,
but don't push it too high.

49:06.068 --> 49:09.321
Well, if Pop says we don't sell, we don't sell.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.615
You don't sell?

49:17.163 --> 49:19.290
Well, I tried to do it nice.

49:56.619 --> 49:58.245
There it is, Alisha.

49:58.329 --> 50:01.791
A perfect example
of how a tenement slum commences.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.918
Which one is the Kwimper's?

50:04.001 --> 50:05.878
The hideosity with the dock.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.131
What about the rest of the homesteaders,

50:09.215 --> 50:10.674
you plan to get rid of those, too?

50:10.800 --> 50:12.843
I certainly am. One way or another,

50:12.927 --> 50:15.179
once you've got rid of the Kwimpers.

50:15.304 --> 50:17.014
How long will it take you?

50:17.389 --> 50:20.184
Well, Arthur,
it's not going to be any quick thing.

50:20.309 --> 50:22.728
The State Welfare requires
a complete list of interviews

50:22.812 --> 50:24.563
with everybody concerned.

50:24.647 --> 50:27.817
Very well. Start interviewing.

50:28.818 --> 50:30.194
How long has he been here?

50:30.319 --> 50:33.531
It doesn't matter.
He's got the IQ of a grasshopper.

50:34.865 --> 50:38.244
Well, with those shoulders,
he sure looks like a genius to me.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.204
Introduce me, Arthur.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.463
Kwimper, this is Miss Alisha Claypoole.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.882
She is our State Welfare supervisor.

50:52.007 --> 50:54.552
- Oh, how do, ma'am?
- Oh, stay right where you are.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.512
- You can go now, Arthur.
-But...

50:56.595 --> 50:58.264
Thank you, Arthur.

50:58.389 --> 50:59.557
Hmm.

50:59.682 --> 51:01.642
- What's your first name?
- Toby.

51:01.725 --> 51:02.768
Mine's Alisha.

51:02.852 --> 51:05.604
- Well, how do, Alisha?
- Oh, please relax.

51:06.397 --> 51:09.275
Did you understand what Arthur King
meant when he mentioned your IQ?

51:09.400 --> 51:11.735
I reckon he meant I'm not smart.

51:11.861 --> 51:13.237
I hope he didn't hurt your feelings.

51:13.320 --> 51:14.321
No, ma'am.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.240
There's a couple of things I am smart about,

51:16.365 --> 51:18.868
and one of them's not letting my feelings
get hurt easy.

51:18.951 --> 51:21.245
That's smart. That's even wise.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.457
Anybody ever tell you
you're very handsome?

51:25.583 --> 51:26.959
Only girls.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.170
Don't you like girls?

51:29.545 --> 51:32.965
I like girls all right,
except when they start to bother me.

51:33.424 --> 51:34.758
A young, virile man like you,

51:34.842 --> 51:36.927
I should think you'd love to be bothered.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.512
Well, the bothering part is all right,

51:38.596 --> 51:40.181
but I ain't gonna marry no girl

51:40.264 --> 51:43.392
and build no house
just so I can be bothered regular.

51:44.643 --> 51:47.563
Flight from paternity.
Oedipus is everywhere.

51:48.230 --> 51:49.857
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

51:49.940 --> 51:51.192
Nothing.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.737
You know, Toby,
that the State Welfare Department

51:54.820 --> 51:56.405
is deeply interested in you.

51:56.488 --> 51:57.781
How come?

51:58.282 --> 51:59.950
'Cause you're a very interesting man.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.452
I am?

52:01.785 --> 52:04.747
You have exquisite proportions,
why, your legs are amazing...

52:04.830 --> 52:06.248
That tickles, ma'am. That tickles.

52:06.332 --> 52:08.167
That's because I hit
a very sensitive nerve that...

52:08.292 --> 52:09.960
(CLEARING THROAT)

52:10.336 --> 52:13.339
If you have finished tickling Toby's leg,
I'd like him to do a chore.

52:14.256 --> 52:15.257
Who would this be?

52:15.341 --> 52:16.467
That's Holly.

52:16.592 --> 52:19.595
Hello, Holly.
Say "how do you do" to Alisha.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.348
A member of the Kwimper family?

52:22.431 --> 52:25.059
Oh, Holly's practically a sister to me.

52:25.434 --> 52:26.644
What does practically mean?

52:26.727 --> 52:28.312
We're not related.

52:28.437 --> 52:31.398
Alisha here is a State Welfare supervisor.

52:31.482 --> 52:32.691
That's lucky.

52:33.108 --> 52:36.153
Somebody's welfare
around here needs supervising.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.572
Come and help me fill the water barrel.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.491
I just filled it last night.

52:40.616 --> 52:43.410
Well, it fell over.
I think the twins must have pushed it.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.330
Look, that barrel weighs
200 or 300 pounds, Holly.

52:46.455 --> 52:48.249
The twins couldn't have turned it over.

52:48.332 --> 52:49.750
Maybe they had a little help.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.086
I'll fill it for you later, honey.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.754
Much later.

52:53.837 --> 52:56.715
Right now,
Alisha's got to figure out my welfare.

53:00.970 --> 53:03.847
I've never seen Holly look so upset.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.516
She must be awful thirsty.

53:09.061 --> 53:10.813
Toby, look at me.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.819
You know, total naivetÃƒÂ©
is a hard thing to believe.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.071
But I believe it.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.865
What did you say, ma'am?

53:22.366 --> 53:24.201
Never mind, it's a compliment.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.619
Oh. Thank you.

53:25.703 --> 53:28.205
I'll give you one,
just as soon as I can make one up.

53:28.580 --> 53:31.709
Can't you think of a compliment
without making it up?

53:32.584 --> 53:33.752
Well...

53:36.046 --> 53:37.214
Try.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.426
Try real hard.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.052
(HORN HONKING)

53:42.386 --> 53:43.887
MAN: Hey, Toby,

53:45.014 --> 53:47.266
how are the fish running today?

53:47.391 --> 53:49.935
You ain't got your mind on work,
though, have you?

53:50.060 --> 53:51.228
(HOOTING)

53:51.353 --> 53:54.773
This is about as private as a subway.
Come with me.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.358
I ain't got any secrets.

53:56.442 --> 53:59.987
Well, we just can't have
a good interview with people intruding.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.113
Oh.

54:09.288 --> 54:11.373
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

54:20.382 --> 54:21.675
You comfortable?

54:21.759 --> 54:22.843
Yes, ma'am.

54:23.052 --> 54:24.094
Oh, I see.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.346
You need another pillow?

54:25.429 --> 54:27.389
No, this is fine, thank you.

54:28.307 --> 54:31.727
Well, Toby,
I need to know my subject inside out,

54:31.810 --> 54:35.022
every intimate detail
in order to prescribe help.

54:35.105 --> 54:36.982
I didn't know you was fixing to help me.

54:37.066 --> 54:38.859
Seeing you're friends to Mr. King and all.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.277
Oh, don't worry about Arthur King.

54:40.361 --> 54:42.237
State Welfare wants to help you.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.615
That's what the word
"welfare" means, isn't it?

54:44.740 --> 54:47.159
Yes, ma'am. I never said it didn't.

54:47.659 --> 54:50.996
Well, let's start
with the word association test.

54:51.121 --> 54:54.958
I'll say a word and you say
the first word that pops into your head.

54:55.084 --> 54:58.295
Well, wouldn't it be safer
if I give it a little thought, first?

54:58.629 --> 55:01.465
No, this is a test to
probe your subconscious.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.675
We all know our motives
on the conscious level

55:03.801 --> 55:06.136
and those are the ones
we often try to conceal.

55:06.261 --> 55:07.763
Now, if you answer me right away,

55:07.846 --> 55:09.765
I'll know the motives
you're trying to conceal.

55:09.848 --> 55:13.352
And I'll know the real reasons
for the things you do and say.

55:13.435 --> 55:14.561
Oh.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.690
Now, I got to think about that a little bit.

55:20.651 --> 55:21.985
Are you ready?

55:22.069 --> 55:23.487
Yep. Should I stand up?

55:23.612 --> 55:25.322
Oh, no, no, just relax.

55:27.282 --> 55:30.494
Now, first word,

55:32.037 --> 55:33.330
hurt.

55:33.455 --> 55:34.498
Ow.

55:35.999 --> 55:39.378
Well, I don't think that's a word.
Doesn't matter.

55:40.546 --> 55:42.005
Second word. Ready?

55:43.215 --> 55:45.050
- Help.
_"Helpll?

55:46.677 --> 55:48.220
No, Toby, you don't repeat the word,

55:48.345 --> 55:50.556
you just say what the word suggests to you.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.684
Nobody yells "help."
They always yell "help, help."

55:53.809 --> 55:55.436
So I was waiting for the other "help,"

55:55.519 --> 55:58.522
and when you didn't say "help,"
well, I said "help."

55:59.022 --> 56:00.315
I see.

56:00.524 --> 56:03.485
This isn't going to be
quite as easy as I expected.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.029
Now, the third word.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.198
Steal.

56:08.449 --> 56:09.533
Home.

56:10.075 --> 56:14.329
Oh, you poor boy. You think
somebody's trying to steal your home.

56:14.413 --> 56:16.206
Willie Mays stole home.

56:16.832 --> 56:18.375
Who's Willie May?

56:18.500 --> 56:21.336
Not May, Mays. He's a baseball player.

56:21.420 --> 56:24.339
Oh, never mind.
The association speaks for itself.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.925
Now, number four.

56:29.094 --> 56:30.262
Girl.

56:31.555 --> 56:32.848
Dad.

56:34.099 --> 56:35.476
Holy Moses.

56:35.559 --> 56:36.685
Something wrong?

56:37.519 --> 56:40.939
Toby, I'll just have to ask you
to explain that one for me.

56:41.231 --> 56:43.358
That's the song they're playing.

56:43.775 --> 56:49.239
<i>On top of Old Smoky
Where things get real hot</i>

56:51.074 --> 56:56.246
<i>Where girls are a problem
Which Dad knows I've got</i>

56:58.749 --> 57:00.918
That's pretty good, sing some more.

57:01.627 --> 57:02.753
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

57:02.878 --> 57:07.716
<i>Follow that dream
I've got to follow that</i>

57:07.799 --> 57:11.136
<i>Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving</i>

57:11.261 --> 57:16.099
<i>I've got to follow that dream
wherever that dream may lead</i>

57:16.225 --> 57:20.354
<i>I gotta follow that dream
to find the love I need</i>

57:20.437 --> 57:24.733
<i>When your heart gets restless
Time to move along</i>

57:24.816 --> 57:29.321
<i>When your heart gets weary
Time to sing a song</i>

57:29.446 --> 57:33.992
<i>But when a dream is calling you</i>

57:34.117 --> 57:38.372
<i>There's just one thing that you can do</i>

57:38.455 --> 57:43.669
<i>You've gotta follow that dream
wherever that dream may lead</i>

57:43.794 --> 57:48.298
<i>You gotta follow that dream
to find the love you need</i>

57:49.174 --> 57:52.469
<i>Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving</i>

57:52.594 --> 57:56.932
<i>Got to find me someone whose heart is free</i>

57:57.015 --> 58:01.562
<i>Someone to look for my dream with me</i>

58:01.645 --> 58:06.024
<i>And when I find her, I may find out</i>

58:06.149 --> 58:10.862
<i>That's what my dreams are all about</i>

58:10.988 --> 58:15.951
<i>I've got to follow that dream
wherever that dream may lead</i>

58:16.034 --> 58:19.913
<i>I've got to follow that dream
to find the love I need</i>

58:19.997 --> 58:25.043
<i>I've got to follow that dream
wherever that dream may lead</i>

58:25.168 --> 58:28.046
<i>I've got to follow that dream
to find the love I need</i>

58:28.171 --> 58:32.593
<i>Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along</i>

58:32.676 --> 58:36.847
<i>Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along</i>

58:39.808 --> 58:41.435
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.020
Any more words?

58:43.854 --> 58:46.023
Yes. Love.

58:46.523 --> 58:47.858
Thirty.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.527
You think love begins at 30?

58:50.652 --> 58:53.363
No, ma'am.
Love is when you ain't got any.

58:54.698 --> 58:55.866
Any what?

58:55.949 --> 58:58.410
Any points. Like in tennis.

58:58.744 --> 59:02.372
Love-15, love-30, love-40.

59:03.373 --> 59:04.791
Maybe I should've said love-15,

59:04.875 --> 59:06.752
but it ain't what I thought of.

59:06.877 --> 59:10.714
That's all right.
I just misunderstood you.

59:12.257 --> 59:13.842
Now the last word.

59:14.926 --> 59:16.011
Sex.

59:16.094 --> 59:18.472
One times one is one, one times two is two,

59:18.555 --> 59:20.307
one times three is three...

59:20.390 --> 59:22.726
Fascinating answer. Fascinating.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.853
Did I pass the test?

59:25.228 --> 59:29.107
What you just did spontaneously
was express the realization

59:29.232 --> 59:33.737
that with one person, or one of any species,
sex is a sterile thing.

59:34.237 --> 59:38.200
That can't produce more than
the original number that it started with.

59:40.077 --> 59:43.580
But as soon as there are two,
it becomes productive.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.459
Yes, ma'am. And that's
something you have to watch out for.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.920
Toby, don't spoil the poetry of it.

59:52.923 --> 59:55.717
Oh, well,
that's enough work for this afternoon.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.429
Let's just lie back
and enjoy the afternoon sun.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.896
Do you like me like this, Toby?

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:09.564
You're awful close.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.527
Toby, just put your arm around me

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.072
and do whatever you think of,

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.157
just like you did in the test.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.829
I didn't know the government
gave this kind of test.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.288
Toby.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.258
Now.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.721
One times one is one,
one times two is two,

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.391
one times three is three,
one times four is four...

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.809
HOLLY: Toby!

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.437
Toby, where are you?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.563
That's the end.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.022
No, that's Holly.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.610
Toby, you've gotta come home right away.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:57.112
What happened?

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.115
Somebody opened the bait box.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.617
Now, who'd do a fool thing like that?

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.870
Holly and I know, don't we, Holly?

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.788
Well, come on,
we've got customers waiting.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.083
Okay. How did you happen to find us, Holly?

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.085
Well, I just saw you turn off the highway

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.838
and I followed the dirt road
till the tire tracks stopped.

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.631
Smart girl. Good tracking.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.175
Just like an Indian squaw.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.552
Well, at least we finished the test.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:21.887
I'm sorry I got to go, Alisha.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.472
Just as well.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.975
- I'll be with you in a minute, Toby.
- Okay.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.519
Miss Claypoole.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:30.687
Yes?

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.024
I don't like being called a squaw.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.408
Did I hear a splash?

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:44.910
Your friend went swimming.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.369
Oh, I see.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.746
Swimming?

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:48.914
Yeah.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.724
- Holly.
- Yeah?

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.186
What word would you say
if I were to say a word

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.189
like "boys"?

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.650
I wouldn't say anything.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.944
You wouldn't say anything, why not?

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:21.530
I'd wait for you to finish
whatever you started to say.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.491
Oh, you wouldn't have done no better
at that test than I done then.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.035
You were doing just fine when I arrived.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:29.538
I was doing the multiplication tables.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.581
Were you, Toby?

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.292
- Were you really?
- Yep.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.045
You know what?

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.382
Right after dinner,
I'm gonna teach you the nines table,

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:43.802
and right on through the 12's.
You hear me?

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.136
Uh-huh.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.599
You know, Holly, I can't help but worry
about why that Alisha came here.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.435
Whatever it was, Mr. King put her up to it.

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.187
I sure hope I didn't say nothing wrong

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.315
or they'll use it against us
as sure as baby rabbits.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.652
Especially after
you pushed her into that water.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:02.737

a little early fishing in today.

Have a cup of coffee?

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.466
I don't mind if I do. Thanks.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.262

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.306
Yeah, noisy ones, too.

Have you talked to them?

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:27.739
I talked to them,
they said if it's too noisy, they'd buy us out.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:31.952
Not only that,
they threw dead fish in our water barrel,

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.204
cut loose our rowboats from their moorings,

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.790

a green paint bomb in the john

If you got all your neighbors together

No, what we were
really interested in, Sheriff,

is what ordinances are you gonna enforce?

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.329

like you and Nick here have been doing.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.678
Well, that's not a law,
the way you're saying it.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:39.180
I mean, a law has to be spelled out

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.307

Well, I guess a man generally knows
when he's wrong,

but I guess you're right.

will just close up shop at 11:00

you won't have no trouble at all.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.036
Oh, if we just close up shop at 11:00 at night

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.913
we won't have any trouble at all, huh?

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.331
Now, listen, are you nuts?

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.584
Ourjoint doesn't get started till 11:00.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.710
I know that, Nick.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.379
And a lot of folks would rather take a licking
than close up at 11:00.

You fellas are lucky.

Oh, you'd have thought of that, Nick.

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.770
No, I don't think so. No.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.024
That's the way it's going to be, huh?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.943
I mean, there's no point in discussing
a more sensible arrangement

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:36.988
like let's say 2:00 or 3:00?

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.032

got to have their rest, you know?

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.578
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go about my business.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:45.705
Where you going?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:49.167
I'm going out and tell the folks
they have to go home by 11:00.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.794
I can't let you do that, Toby.

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.546
Well, why not?

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.758
Oh, 'cause I like you.
And the boys like you.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.885
- Right, boys?
- Right, Nick.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.595
Now, being a sheriff
can be a very dangerous thing.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.724
Like, if you walk around out there
with that badge on,

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.268
you might make
some of our players nervous.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:11.606
And some of our players get very rough
when they get nervous, see?

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.859
You don't wanna be no sheriff, Toby.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.319
Terrible things happen to sheriffs.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.988
Like what, Nick?

Sure, boss.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.665

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.042
Yeah, the full treatment.

some business to take care of.

Nice talking to you again.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.354
Let me tell you about
some of the things a sheriff runs up against.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.064
First, don't you have a gun or a club?

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:54.774
Oh, I don't see no need for it.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.276
I figure if a man
is going to be a peace officer,

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.028
he shouldn't go around looking un-peaceful.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.197
No gun, no club.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:03.533
But I can wrestle.
I can wrestle real good, though.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:06.327
Yeah, but suppose someone
sneaked up behind you?

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.330
Yeah. And grabbed your arms like this.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.083
And another one was in front of you
and he had a sap like this.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.252
And he wrapped it around his wrist like this.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.420
You'd be helpless, wouldn't you?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.463
Unless I done something like this.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:18.881

FeHas?

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.149
Blackie, I'm sorry,
I was just showing you...

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.358
AI?

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:41.029
Blackie?

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.910
I think they've had enough time.

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.496
Now, why don't you
run the station wagon around back

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.707
and we'll hand his body out
through the window to you.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.334
What'll I do with him?

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.752
Well, if he's still breathing,

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.962
drop him off at the nearest hospital.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.266
What happened?

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.519
They were showing me
how I shouldn't get hurt.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.356
I wish they'd wake up
so I could apologize to them.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.649
I don't think they can hear me now.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.319

I'll get some attention.

You can't do that.

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.615

it's for locking in.

we can use for a jail.

I'm a woman.

they were trying to run us down.

don't mean they tried to do it on purpose.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.705
I'll give you one guess
who's gonna be sorry.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.082
Look, Mac, it was all a mistake, you know.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.084
It's always a mistake to get drunk.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.587
Hey, you quit and we'll quit.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.632
I ain't quitting till I get them guns off of you,
all of them.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.634
Just drop them right there and move away.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:49.678
No, that ain't reasonable, Mac,
got nothing doing.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.514
All right, Charlie, Larry,
let them have it!

the stinking hardware. Drop it.

All right, that's far enough.

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:16.038
I'll put the car keys
back in the ignition for you, fellas.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.123
Wait a minute, Mac.

You're not gonna leave us
in this jungle, are you?

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.628
Well, you gotta sober up somewhere.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:23.796
I would lock you up,

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.090
but the three of you'd be
kind of cramped in ourjohn.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.299
Yeah...

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.552
Look, after we sober up,
how do we get out of here?

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:33.639
Well, when the sun comes up,
you just walk straight towards it

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.391
and that'll take you back to the road.

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:37.393
You fellas better not
hang around here anymore.

sneaking around our porch.

he's down on the dock.

We'll have to drive down
and load it onto the car.

- A good one, big one.

I went to the school to pick up
the twins and I had Ariadne with me.

He had a policeman and a State Trooper.

And he said that he was taking them
to the Welfare Department.

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:43.198
He said that it was the law

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:45.575
and that there was just nothing
he could do about it.

had something to do with this.

Well, you can witness this, too.

for snitching our kids.

Judge Waterman respects my opinion
as State Welfare supervisor

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:23.905
and it is my opinion that you people
are simply not fit to raise children.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.950

considering their environment.

where you came from,

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:50.724

I must tell you again.

This whole area was
put in for the public's benefit.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.659
How can you get your hat on
with your head so crooked?

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.746
Do you think the people is one thing
and the public is another thing?

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:15.707
You're like every department jackass
I ever knowed.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.709
You do nothing for a single, solitary soul,

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.336
and that is because you're pretending

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:20.879

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.214
For the public.

but me and him and her?

God, please turn your head away.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:32.641
And you and you.
Now get out of here and leave us alone.

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:36.103
- But don't you...
- Don't argue with him, Arthur. Let's go.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.990
Some mighty fine talking, Pop.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.161
I'd have done better to save
my gums for tomorrow.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.872
We'll get the kids back, won't we, Pop?

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:58.792
I ain't gonna lie to you, Holly.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.877

by the Department of Public Welfare

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:39.374
for a court order, giving the Department
control and guardianship

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:41.877

are you represented by counsel?

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.758
Come again, Judge?

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.886
Have you got a lawyer?

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:54.097
No, sir. Don't believe in them. Never did.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.725
- Don't you indeed?
- No, sir.

01:29:57.893 --> 01:30:00.437
Well, suit yourself.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.606
Thank you, Judge.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:07.068
Now then, since this is
a hearing and not a trial,

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:10.030
let's keep it simple and informal.

01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:11.698

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:22.042
with the responsibility of ministering
to the well being of all its citizens.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:24.085
Particularly those of its children.

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:28.006
The cases of these three children have
caused the Department deep concern.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.424
Why, the twins live in a home

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:32.886
that is hardly more than a breeding ground
for delinquency and crime.

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:37.349
The Kwimper adults are immoral,
defiant of authority,

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.893
and strongly suspected
of illicitly obtaining funds

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.645
from government agencies.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:45.815
And they are also known
to have associated closely with gangsters.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.361
I shall document each of these charges
when the time comes.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:53.156
As part of our proof that the Kwimpers
are unfit to raise children,

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:57.160
I shall ask Mr. King to report
on his dealings with the Kwimper family.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:03.750
By taking advantage of a technicality,
Your Honor,

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:06.211
these people set their own interests

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.838
above those of six million taxpayers.

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.383
When I tried to persuade the Kwimpers

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:14.803
to abandon their antisocial point of view,

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:16.972
I received nothing but abuse,

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:21.184
in the course of which,
the elder Kwimper boasted

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.687
that he habitually received relief funds

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:26.064
as well as aid to dependent children.

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:30.277
I later learned that Toby Kwimper
served in the Army

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.823
where he tricked the doctors into
awarding him a total disability allowance.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.577
I use the word "tricked" advisedly.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.745
I can prove that he suffers

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:44.499
from no physical disqualifications at all.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.543
Anything more?

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.878
Quite a lot, Your Honor.

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:51.089
The Department should like to point out

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:52.966
that the Kwimpers have no legal status

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.801
as guardians for these children.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:59.097
Moreover, the Kwimpers
encouraged two notorious gangsters

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.058
to set up a gambling establishment
in their neighborhood.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.353
Subsequently, the Kwimpers
quarreled with the gangsters,

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:07.272
burned down their establishment,

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.399
and finally drove them out at gunpoint.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.361
Yes, I heard something about that.
Frightening.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:14.696
Terrible.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:18.116
So is the fact that an unmarried girl

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.910
by the name of Holly Jones
lives with the Kwimpers

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:23.997
in a relationship that I would
not care to explore.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.206
Goodness.

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:28.960
What a terrible thing to say.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:32.714
Be quiet. You will have an opportunity
to answer the charges.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.176
One final point, Your Honor.

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.303
As a qualified psychologist,

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:41.056
I gave Toby Kwimper
a word association test

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:44.059
which is designed to
reveal basic motivations.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.020
It was during the process of giving this test

01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:50.106
that I was attacked
and knocked down by Miss Jones.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:55.111
And you people claim
that you don't need a lawyer?

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:57.864
What did the test reveal?

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:02.452
Attitudes that were shocking
to the entire Welfare Department.

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:04.913
I submit a copy to the court.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:17.092
Well, what have you to say about all this?

01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:25.308
Judge, would you mind if we hashed
this over by ourselves for a little while?

01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:29.479
Hash it over, by all means.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:32.982
Thank you, Judge.

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:36.778
Do you know what I think, Pop?

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:38.530
I think we don't look so good.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.074
It's unfair.
She's twisted every single fact.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:43.201
Now, somebody's gonna untwist it.

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:44.744
Good for you, Pop.

01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:47.163
Not me. I'll get mad
and that won't do any good.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.832
You take care of it, Toby.

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:51.209
Me? I ain't very good at talking.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.670
We won't be no worse off than we are now.

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:55.380
Please, Toby.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.006
Go ahead, son. Go ahead.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.216
I don't know, Pop.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.093
Please. Please, son.

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:04.973
I'll probably make a mess of things, Judge,

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.559
but Pop and Holly here,
they've got faith in me.

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:10.186
So, here goes.

01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:12.313
You may still hire a lawyer.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:15.150
Well, Pop's already said no to that

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.361
and Pop's usually right
about everything he says.

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.196
First off, maybe I was wrong

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.907
when I wanted to throw Mr. King
off the property.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:24.033
Very gracious of you.

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:25.118
Yes, sir.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:29.289
There's no need for me to get ornery
just because Mr. King got a little nasty.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:32.667
Now, just what nasty thing did Mr. King do?

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:37.172
He tried to throw us off the property
that he had no say-so about.

01:34:37.547 --> 01:34:39.674
Got our backs up and everything.

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.719
Judge, would it be legal-like

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:45.930
if I were to answer some of the things
that was said against me, personal?

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:48.641
You may choose the order of your rebuttal.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.019
That means it's all right?

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:52.729
Yes.

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.191
Well, about my back, then.

01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:58.818
They told me at Fort Dix
that I strained my back

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:00.737
after my first judo lesson.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.948
I told the docs it had straightened out
after the next lesson

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:05.867
and it weren't nothing to begin with.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:08.995
But they said it was
and I had to go on total disability.

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:10.497
Now, I'm willing to admit

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.832
that a doctor might know
just a little bit more than me,

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:15.543
so I've been taking the checks ever since.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.170
But the way it's worked out,

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:19.255
I might have done the wrong thing.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.508
And if I did, I'm awful sorry.

01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:25.094
Are you defending yourself,
or making a confession?

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.264
I'm just trying to tell what happened.
Is that all right?

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:31.559
Well, it's pretty unusual, but go on.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:34.604
Judge, it don't do me no good

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:37.774
to talk against people who ain't here
to answer back.

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:39.692
But all we done to Nick and Carmine

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:42.153
was just return a package
they left at our house.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:43.655
We didn't know there was a bomb in it.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.324
If we'd have known it,
we'd have thrown it in the bay.

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.451
And we didn't chase them off
at gunpoint, either.

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:51.454
When their place blowed up,
they just up and beat it.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.833
Well, if you can prove that,
it takes care of an important point.

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:58.419
Oh, I can prove it, Judge,
but it don't seem that important to me.

01:35:58.545 --> 01:36:00.880
It doesn't, eh? Why not?

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.674
Well, if I was a Judge,

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.718
in charge of deciding who was to bring up
three nice kids,

01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:07.554
I'd just be wondering

01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:10.598
if Pop was a good man and if Holly

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:13.726
was a good woman.

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.020
You can ask the twins about Holly.

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:19.274
I mean, they're just kids,
but kids know who they love.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.402
And who taught them everything they know
and made them like it.

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:26.072
Dog me, Holly's just a kid, too,
but they don't come no better.

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:27.240
And smart, too.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:28.491
If it weren't for her,

01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:31.286
we'd really be on relief right now
or starving to death.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:35.373
I've already pointed out why he'd be
prejudiced on that point, Your Honor.

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:37.959
I reckon I'm prejudiced on a lot of points
you ain't, ma'am.

01:36:38.084 --> 01:36:40.920
First of all, I'm prejudiced
against twisting the truth around.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:43.339
And I'm prejudiced against hurting kids.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:47.010
Particularly hurting them
just because I'm sore at their folks.

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:48.511
Judge, can I say something?

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:49.721
Go ahead.

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:52.432
I don't like to say this, Judge.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:55.059
I don't like to talk against
a woman's good name.

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:57.312
But for the sake of the kids, though,
I gotta do it.

01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:00.273
Well, you certainly have me interested.

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:03.026
Hell ain't got no fury like a woman scorned.

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:05.820
Yes?

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.157
That's all, Judge.

01:37:11.367 --> 01:37:14.537
Well, Mr. Kwimper, your observation
may or may not be accurate.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.456
I couldn't say which, myself.

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:18.833
But I would like to know why you said it.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:22.003
I said it because it's true, Judge.

01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:23.755
That Miss Claypoole there,

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:26.674
she went after Toby
like he come with green coupons.

01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:28.217
She was leaning on him,

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:31.095
she was tickling him,
she was kissing him.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:33.264
And when he paid her no never mind

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:36.392
she set out to give us
what hell ain't got no fury like.

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:40.730
Your Honor, I shall not dignify
that falsehood with a denial.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.357
I should simply like to point out

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.317
that it is not I who am on trial here.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.862
No one is on trial here, Miss Claypoole.
This is a hearing.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:52.033
Now do you support
what your father just said?

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:54.911
I'd rather not answer that, sir.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:59.707
Very well. Briefly then,
did Miss Claypoole ever kiss you?

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.335
Yes, sir.

01:38:02.418 --> 01:38:03.711
Really, Your Honor,

01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:05.463
what do you expect them to say?

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.965
Why, they'll clutch at any straw.

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:09.050
Please be seated, Miss Claypoole,

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:11.219
and we'll have no further interruptions.

01:38:12.345 --> 01:38:13.721
Continue.

01:38:14.931 --> 01:38:17.642
I was talking about Pop

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:20.937
and how it might help you
to know the kind of man he is.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.606
Pop don't like to be talked about

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:26.067
and I most generally try to do what he likes.

01:38:26.776 --> 01:38:29.404
But I can't help myself this time, though.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.407
My pop's an ornery man, Judge,

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:33.950
that's 'cause he's so smart.

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:37.578
He can't stand it when people act stupid.

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:41.457
I ain't so bright myself
and it's a wonder to me

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.960
that we get along as well as we do.

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:46.921
Many a times I was a-minded
to go against him.

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:50.508
I thought maybe there was more to living

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.593
than just enjoying it the way Pop taught me.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:57.598
But I was never dumb enough
to go against him, Judge.

01:38:57.807 --> 01:39:00.601
And it usually turned out I was glad I didn't.

01:39:00.727 --> 01:39:04.814
Now, it's a fact that Ariadne
and the twins and Holly ain't no kin to Pop.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.942
Now, don't that make you
stop and think, Judge?

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:10.862
You name me another man
that would take in three hungry children

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:14.657
just because they ain't got no place to go
and no one to turn to.

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.744
Pop ain't got no money.
He ain't never had.

01:39:18.745 --> 01:39:20.955
Why'd he take in three strange kids?

01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:24.959
<i>I'l</i> l tell you why, Judge,
it's 'cause he's a good man.

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:28.504
He's always been good to me
and he's always been good to them.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.339
He always will be, too.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.133
Now, that's all that matters here today,

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:34.761
and if you don't know that, Judge,

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:36.596
you ain't no judge.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:42.351
Your Honor,

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:46.814
may I remind you of my findings
in this man's word association test?

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:48.649
He may mean well consciously,

01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:52.195
but his subconscious motivations
are all that really matter.

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:56.616
Well, have you anything
to say about that test?

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.119
Yes, sir. Could I say it in private?

01:40:00.203 --> 01:40:01.579
Very well.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.456
Thank you.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:15.009
Counsel for the defense points out then,
very correctly,

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:18.096
that his test has nothing to do
with the case.

01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:22.016
It is his father who is the children's
presumptive guardian.

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:25.520
Well, let his father take the test.
I have one right here.

01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:27.647
That was counsel's suggestion.

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:29.982
Yes.

01:40:39.367 --> 01:40:40.868
That's a good idea.

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.371
Mr. Kwimper, please.

01:40:46.165 --> 01:40:48.167
Did you get light in the head?

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:52.839
Mr. Kwimper, do you understand
the word association test?

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:55.216
- The test that Toby took? Yep.
- That's right.

01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:57.510
Would you sit down there, please?

01:40:58.386 --> 01:41:00.555
Very well, we may proceed.

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.390
Ready?

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.183
Yep.

01:41:05.017 --> 01:41:06.269
Court.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:11.065
Child.

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:14.402
We're cooked.

01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:16.279

01:41:39.302 --> 01:41:40.928
Those will be sufficient, Your Honor.

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:43.764
All right.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kwimper.

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.393
You're welcome, Judge.

01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:51.314
Can you analyze these answers now?

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.232
I believe so.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.151
Very well. We'll proceed.

01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.320
Court. Crime.

01:41:58.654 --> 01:42:02.366
Well, that's the simple-minded
response of a criminal nature.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:05.328
A court is where you go
when you've committed a crime.

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:06.829
Now wait a minute.

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.123
Never mind.

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.334
Child. Labor.

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:13.544
Oh, that's obvious.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:16.756
He thinks of children in terms
of exploiting their labor.

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:18.883
Oh, now, really, I think that is...

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:22.011
Your Honor,
I have a Master's degree in psychology.

01:42:25.681 --> 01:42:27.683
Moon. Shine.

01:42:28.768 --> 01:42:33.356
That's an illegal liquor drunk
by illiterate, irresponsible alcoholics.

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.609
<i>What about Shine On, Harvest Moon?
That's </i> a song.

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:39.111
What's that got to do with alcoholics?

01:42:39.445 --> 01:42:41.322
- I don't understand...
- That's enough.

01:42:41.447 --> 01:42:43.407
Your request for a court order is denied.

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:45.201
I don't think you understand.
Any qualified...

01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:49.121
Miss Claypoole, you're the one
who doesn't understand this test.

01:42:49.205 --> 01:42:52.750
Those answers were not Mr. Kwimper's.
They were mine.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:53.960
(PEOPLE MUTTERING)

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:56.045
That was counsel's suggestion.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.016
And you, Mr. Kwimper,
were right about not needing a lawyer.

01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.352
You couldn't have had a better one.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:16.649
Well, this court has had
a remarkable experience today.

01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:20.820
It's had the rare privilege
of listening to an honest man.

01:43:20.903 --> 01:43:23.072
And it's had a further privilege.

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:25.992
It has heard the history
of a little settlement,

01:43:26.075 --> 01:43:29.829
a little colony that overcame hardships,

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:32.206
fought back men of evil purpose

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:37.336
and survived all kinds
of legalistic and financial difficulties.

01:43:38.504 --> 01:43:41.173
It's gratifying to know
that the spirit of the pioneer,

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:43.718
the spirit that made this
the greatest country in the world,

01:43:43.843 --> 01:43:45.511
ladies and gentlemen,

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.057
it's thrilling to know that this spirit
is still functioning today.

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:54.103
Our government needs it more than ever,
don't you think?

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.439
I agree, Judge. I'm willing to admit

01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:58.941
that I've been letting
the government down a little lately,

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:02.570
I haven't been taking any relief
or unemployment insurance

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.323
but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:07.366
We'll get together sometime.

What did that Claypoole woman do
to make you kiss her?

Oh, you know, Holly.
You know.

No, I don't.

I remember.

01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:33.030
Well, we was lying on them...

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:37.159
Oh, I want you to show me
exactly what happened.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.247
Now,

01:47:41.997 --> 01:47:45.000
you were lying down like this.
And then what?

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:47.920
Then she kind of
leaned down real close to me.

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:52.132
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.135
She run her fingers over my forehead.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:47:59.682
Like this?

01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:03.811
Well, not so much like you was
ironing a shirt, it was a little softer.

01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:06.939
That's it.

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:11.485
And then she made me
put my arms around her.

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.994
- Like this?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:48:20.536 --> 01:48:23.998
Then she leaned down and kissed me,
and I guess I kissed her.

12 times 12 is 144.
