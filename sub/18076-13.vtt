In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:29.697 --> 01:31.274
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:31.365 --> 01:34.366
These men promptIy escaped
from a maximum-security stockade...

01:34.451 --> 01:35.994
to the Los AngeIes underground.

01:36.078 --> 01:39.743

they survive as soIdiers of fortune.

-Dad, are you okay?
-Yes.

06:14.482 --> 06:18.182
But our partners,
they're not going to like this at all.

06:30.539 --> 06:33.493
Now, brace yourselves, guys.
This could be in the thousands.

06:33.584 --> 06:35.826
lf the damage is that bad,
heads are gonna roll.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.707
l can't believe they did this.
They wrecked our restaurant.

06:38.797 --> 06:41.123
Or what's left of it. Let's take a look.

06:45.429 --> 06:48.430
Somebody sat on our hat, fellows,
and they made a big mistake.

06:48.516 --> 06:51.137
Face, run a tab on all this.
We'll get every penny back.

06:51.268 --> 06:53.012
Sam. lt's Hannibal.

06:54.146 --> 06:56.435
Oh, no. Look at this.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.105
All that Waterford Crystal l borrowed...

06:59.193 --> 07:01.351
from Universal premiere
at the Sheraton Hotel.

07:01.445 --> 07:04.861
You didn't borrow nothing.
You stole it about three or four years ago.

07:04.949 --> 07:07.700
Poor folks was having a party
to celebrate their movie.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.739
Now they gotta wind up
drinking champagne out of paper cups.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.321
l just wanted to do something nice for Sam.

07:13.541 --> 07:17.373
What, did you want him to open this place
with plastic cups and paper plates?

07:17.461 --> 07:20.498
Mack Murdock was tired
of plastic cups and paper plates...

07:20.756 --> 07:22.879
and bleary-eyed broads with yellow teeth.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.837
This trip to Chinatown
was like a ride on a neon horse.

07:25.928 --> 07:29.379
The hot sounds,
the smell of grease crashing in on him.

07:29.473 --> 07:33.341
He remembered Sam Yeng
and that night in Saigon...

07:33.435 --> 07:36.721
when he and the A-Team
huddled in the basement of Sam's house...

07:36.814 --> 07:39.898
and rocket fire blew holes in the walls...

07:39.984 --> 07:42.226
and it was scorched into his memory.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.104
What is this fool talking about now?

07:44.196 --> 07:47.031
You don't recognize that?
That's a bad Philip Marlowe.

07:47.116 --> 07:49.951
l think Murdock's been watching
too many Humphrey Bogart movies.

07:50.035 --> 07:53.155
Yeah, you tell them, Face guy. You tell them.

07:55.457 --> 07:58.661
You come. The A-Team has come.
Thank you.

07:59.253 --> 08:02.254
We owe you so much, old man.
That's why we're here.

08:03.007 --> 08:05.332
Sun, are you all right?
Why don't you sit down?

08:05.426 --> 08:06.540
Thank you.

08:06.635 --> 08:09.340
We will lose the restaurant, l think.

08:09.430 --> 08:12.217
We won't pay protection money
to the Lung Chin...

08:12.308 --> 08:14.384
so they came and shot up our restaurant.

08:14.477 --> 08:17.727
l called
because l have no one else l can trust.

08:17.813 --> 08:20.221
lf l call the police, they will kill us.

08:20.316 --> 08:21.726
You did the right thing, Sam.

08:21.817 --> 08:25.862
Yes, they even shot
Faceman's scammed crystal. Nothing left.

08:25.946 --> 08:29.481
Well, we set you up in this place
because we owed you a great deal.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.280
The debt is paid. l should not have called.

08:32.369 --> 08:35.240
Not even the A-Team
can fight the Lung Chin.

08:35.331 --> 08:37.822
Now don't make book on that, Sam.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.703
l mean, if they walk on two legs
and they breathe air...

08:40.794 --> 08:44.210
they eat dirt and they do the chicken
just like everybody else.

08:44.298 --> 08:48.711
The Lung Chin is a Chinese tong.
They control everything in Chinatown.

08:48.802 --> 08:52.302
A tong? l thought tongs
were social clubs these days.

08:52.389 --> 08:53.884
Not the Lung Chin.

08:53.974 --> 08:58.102
They came from China about a year ago
and they are like the old tongs.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.939
lf one defies them, they will not stop...

09:01.023 --> 09:03.858
until they have extracted the full penalty.

09:03.943 --> 09:07.193
Well, the Lung Chin has just taken on
the A-Team.

09:07.279 --> 09:09.402
Now, where do these guys hang out, Sam?

09:09.490 --> 09:13.073
You must not go, Hannibal.
There are too many of them, all around.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.114
-All armed and all killers.
-Father--

09:16.205 --> 09:19.621
Tommy Chen, her boyfriend,
is in the Lung Chin now.

09:19.917 --> 09:24.164
He has become one of them. He was
with the ones who ruined this place today.

09:24.255 --> 09:26.081
They forced him to join.

09:26.173 --> 09:29.293
lf he didn't,
they would have killed his parents.

09:29.510 --> 09:33.424
Okay, Sam.
Now, where do these guys hang out?

09:33.806 --> 09:36.973
Two blocks over,
in an office above the laundry.

09:37.059 --> 09:40.891
But you'll never get in, because they have
men guarding everywhere.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.972

headquarters is just a few blocks down here.

Oh, yeah? Terrific.

09:57.163 --> 10:01.112

into one of Lung Chin's roadblocks.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.667
ln case you hadn't noticed...

10:02.751 --> 10:05.622
we have more eyes on us
than a truckload of ldaho spuds.

10:05.796 --> 10:08.168
He's right.
Something big is about to go down here.

10:08.257 --> 10:12.385
Don't worry. We're just taking a nice, slow,
innocent little drive down the street.

10:12.469 --> 10:13.501
Sure we were.

10:13.596 --> 10:18.471
But somewhere around this pagoda factory
something is closing in on me right now.

10:18.559 --> 10:21.975
Something bigger.
Something maybe we wouIdn't find.

from one end of my gut to the other.

a new identity, new papers, everything.

Never mind that.
Where's Sam and Sun Yeng?

37:52.755 --> 37:55.044
-Alive.
-You better hope so, sucker...

37:55.132 --> 37:58.216

Well, you're never gonna stop them.

38:20.366 --> 38:21.908
We stopped you.

38:22.243 --> 38:24.531
Never can tell. We could be on a roll.

Right, Thomas?

41:37.146 --> 41:40.266
Yeah, the guy's out of the country
for about 10 years...

41:40.357 --> 41:44.141
and he comes back to the good old U.S.A.
to start up his old action again.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.727
Now what would he want with microfilm?

41:46.822 --> 41:51.034
A list of names.
l mean, some old phone numbers.

he was going to a house...

Like that time l thought
l was a plaid jacket named Willy.

something before l hurt him.

at the Maltese Fool...
