<i>Are we rolling?</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:42.459
<i>Okay, we're rolling.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:45.254
<i>Dave's birthday message,
take 1.</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:46.964
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.508
<i>We know how hard you've been
working on Ashley's album...</i>

00:49.675 --> 00:50.926
<i>so we thought it would be fun</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:52.636
<i>to surprise you
with a little party.</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:56.014
<i>Hey! I thought you said this
was a going-away party for us.</i>

00:57.975 --> 00:58.976
Take 2.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.310
<i>To celebrate your birthday...</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:03.438
<i>and The Chipettes leaving to
guest-judge American Idol...</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:05.524
<i>we thought we'd throw you
a small get...</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:07.025
<i>Hold on, that's the DJ!</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:08.610
<i>Wait, "DJ"?</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:13.365
<i>Okay, fine, so it might be
a medium-sized get-together.</i>

01:13.657 --> 01:15.701
Alvin, did you
hire someone to build

01:15.826 --> 01:17.369
a half-pipe in the back yard?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.997
Of course not!
The party planner did.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.498
You hired a party planner?

01:21.665 --> 01:24.209
No, he did not hire
a "party planner."

01:24.376 --> 01:25.669
Thank goodness.
For a minute there, I...

01:25.836 --> 01:27.671
lam an event planner.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.673
Marco, I'm done
giving you instructions.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.841
Boy.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.760
<i>Dave, it's all good.
It's just us.</i>

01:33.844 --> 01:35.637
<i>Nothing too cra...</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:38.390
<i>Theodore!
You hit the flip button!</i>

01:38.557 --> 01:40.517
<i>Oops! Um, hi.</i>

01:40.976 --> 01:44.313
So, the guest list got
a little out of hand.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.689
A little?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.065
<i>Dave, I had nothing
to do with this!</i>

01:47.190 --> 01:50.652
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!
Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:52.195
Redfoo is here?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.031
<i>Yeah, he is,
because I got him here.</i>

01:54.197 --> 01:57.576
<i>The Redfoo, from a little band
called The Foo Fighters.</i>

01:57.743 --> 01:58.744
<i>What?</i>

01:59.036 --> 02:01.079
<i>Well, there's no way
to sugarcoat it, Dave.</i>

02:01.204 --> 02:02.247
<i>The cops are here!...</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:03.582
<i>And they're having a blast!</i>

02:03.749 --> 02:04.791
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

02:05.917 --> 02:07.461
This does wonders
for my glutes!

02:07.669 --> 02:09.420
This party is the least
we can do for you, Dave.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.007
<i>Yeah! Giving up
songwriting to produce?</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:13.216
<i>Buying a new house?</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:15.385
<i>We know you've done
all of this for us.</i>

02:15.552 --> 02:17.054
<i>We love you, Dave!</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:22.851
<i>Happy Birthday, Dwayne.</i>

02:23.018 --> 02:24.728
<i>It's Dave!</i>

02:31.902 --> 02:34.821
I got 40 cheese pizzas here
for a, Theodore.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.115
Whoo-hoo! Pay the man, Si.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.451
Whoo!

02:40.410 --> 02:41.453
Redf00!

02:41.578 --> 02:44.081
You ready to rock this party
with a little <i>Party Rock?</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:45.666
You like the classics.

02:46.043 --> 02:50.256
<i>But</i> I <i>got</i> a <i>new one for you,
Juicy Wiggle!</i>

02:50.965 --> 02:52.633

Ooh, cool!

03:25.958 --> 03:27.126

04:06.499 --> 04:08.501
Yeah! I'm in.

04:08.793 --> 04:10.127
Show 'em what you got, Theo!

04:18.385 --> 04:19.386
TH EODOREI Wh00-h00!

04:22.014 --> 04:23.682
He's so smooth.

04:25.142 --> 04:28.687
Whoo! Yeah!

04:28.979 --> 04:30.898
Whoo-whee!

04:34.360 --> 04:35.361
Is that safe?

04:35.528 --> 04:37.822
No, it is absolutely not.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.535
What the...

04:43.536 --> 04:46.705
Um, excuse me, young lady?
The launch ramp is closed.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.374
Hey, Simon's gonna go!

04:49.166 --> 04:51.377
No, no, no, I'm not going.

04:51.502 --> 04:53.420
I was just explaining
that this is really...

04:53.546 --> 04:54.713
High!

04:59.093 --> 05:01.679
That was awesome!
I'm definitely going again.

05:03.097 --> 05:04.682
Boys.

05:06.058 --> 05:07.059
Whoo!

05:10.896 --> 05:13.190
When I say "Party,"
you say "Alvin!"

05:13.357 --> 05:15.234
- Party!
- Alvin!

05:15.401 --> 05:17.069
Party!
Alvin!

05:17.194 --> 05:18.154
Party!

05:18.237 --> 05:19.864
Alvin!

05:21.082 --> 05:22.083
Um...

05:22.250 --> 05:24.127
Surprise?

05:24.252 --> 05:25.253
Whoo-hoo!

05:27.422 --> 05:29.090
Boy.

05:30.592 --> 05:31.843
If anyone needs us,

05:31.926 --> 05:34.763
we'll just be...
Across the country.

05:35.638 --> 05:37.807
Over there, come on.
Party's over.

05:38.558 --> 05:40.477
Thank you.
Yeah, that's mine.

05:41.102 --> 05:42.062
You had to grab
one last one?

05:42.145 --> 05:43.146
Yeah.
Okay.

05:43.271 --> 05:45.273
Enjoy that, yeah.

05:45.607 --> 05:46.900
Were you surprised?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.778
No, I wasn't surprised,
and you wanna know why?

05:49.944 --> 05:53.156
Because #Davesparty
was trending on Twitter.

05:53.323 --> 05:54.407
Nice!

05:55.158 --> 05:56.618
I mean, sorry.

05:57.077 --> 05:58.495
I know my work schedule
istoughn.

05:58.661 --> 05:59.871
But I thought you guys
were old enough

05:59.954 --> 06:01.122
to take care of yourselves.

06:01.289 --> 06:02.665
But I guess you're
not mature enough for that.

06:02.832 --> 06:05.418
That's insulting.
We are very mature.

06:06.628 --> 06:09.464
Sorry. Pizza toots.

06:10.423 --> 06:12.425
Look, I'm trying to start
a new chapter in my life.

06:12.509 --> 06:13.843
A more stable chapter...

06:14.010 --> 06:15.220
where you guys
aren't performing

06:15.303 --> 06:16.846
in a different city
every night.

06:17.013 --> 06:18.515
But, we love to perform.

06:19.265 --> 06:21.309
You can go back to that,
just not now, okay?

06:21.476 --> 06:23.019
I want you guys
to have a few years

06:23.144 --> 06:24.145
of being normal kids.

06:24.646 --> 06:25.814
But we're not
normal kids, Dave.

06:25.939 --> 06:27.023
Yeah...

06:27.190 --> 06:29.692
we're multi-platinum singing
chipmunks! Oops.

06:29.818 --> 06:30.777
Well, right now,

06:30.860 --> 06:32.320
you're acting like
a bunch of animals...

06:32.487 --> 06:36.491
who just threw a giant house
party without my permission.

06:36.783 --> 06:39.494
Does this mean
no miniature golf tomorrow?

06:39.661 --> 06:41.204
It should, and normally,
it would.

06:41.371 --> 06:43.498
But, you're gonna give us
one last chance, right?

06:44.207 --> 06:48.002
I think he means
our 158th last chance?

06:48.169 --> 06:49.838
Look, selfishly,
I wanna spend as much time

06:49.963 --> 06:50.964
with you guys as I can...

06:51.131 --> 06:52.132
before I have to go to

06:52.215 --> 06:53.675
Ashley's album release
in Miami.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.553
Whoo-hoo!
We're going to Miami!

07:03.059 --> 07:05.186
Theodore, get our Speedos!
Yeah!

07:05.562 --> 07:06.563
No, no Speedos.

07:06.688 --> 07:07.814
I'm going to Miami.

07:07.981 --> 07:09.065
I only got a plus one,

07:09.190 --> 07:11.067
so it wouldn't be fair
to pick favorites.

07:11.234 --> 07:12.277
Shh...

07:12.360 --> 07:14.821
We both know
I'm your favorite.

07:14.988 --> 07:15.947
Alvin.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.365
Tied for favorite?

07:17.532 --> 07:19.367
You don't even have to
say with who.

07:19.534 --> 07:22.078
Blink once for Theodore,
twice for Simon.

07:22.912 --> 07:25.039
Got it, no favorites.

07:34.757 --> 07:36.885
Wind, 35 degrees,
out of the northwest.

07:37.385 --> 07:40.221
Okay, tail up.
10, 10 degrees down.

07:40.388 --> 07:41.556
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

07:41.723 --> 07:43.266
Shoulders to the left,
shoulders to the right.

07:43.391 --> 07:44.517
Tail in, tail out.

07:44.601 --> 07:45.643
While we're young, Simon.

07:45.727 --> 07:46.728
Loosen the grip,
loosen the grip.

07:46.853 --> 07:48.146
Not too loose,
not too loose, Simon.

07:48.229 --> 07:49.606
Any day, now.
And...

07:49.772 --> 07:50.940
my concentration is broken.

07:51.107 --> 07:53.026
Now I have to start all over.
Great!

07:53.109 --> 07:54.152
Let's start this
charade again.

07:54.235 --> 07:55.278
Come on!

07:55.403 --> 07:57.238
This isn't the PGA Tour,
Simon.

07:57.405 --> 08:00.241
Exactly. But this
is what it's all about.

08:00.408 --> 08:02.243
Just 4 dudes
playing some golf.

08:02.410 --> 08:04.078
Actually, that reminds me,...

08:04.245 --> 08:05.830
I invited a friend to join us.

08:05.914 --> 08:07.749
Is this
the famous Samantha

08:07.874 --> 08:09.167
we've been hearing
so much about?

08:09.542 --> 08:11.211
- It is.
- David!

08:11.377 --> 08:13.213
Ooh la la.

08:17.467 --> 08:18.927
Very funny, guys.

08:19.093 --> 08:21.763
Anyway, it's starting to feel
kind of serious, so...

08:21.930 --> 08:23.932
I thought an introduction
would be nice.

08:24.098 --> 08:26.100
You must really
like this girl, Dave.

08:26.267 --> 08:27.936
I do,
and I hope you guys do, too.

08:28.102 --> 08:31.523
Yeah. Any girlfriend of yours
is a girlfriend of ours.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.609
Thatsounded
way less weird in my head.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.277
You think?

08:36.736 --> 08:37.779
She's here.

08:38.279 --> 08:39.280
How do I look?

08:39.447 --> 08:40.782
Well...

08:41.115 --> 08:43.326
You know? Looks.

08:43.451 --> 08:45.453
Alvin! This is no time
for honesty.

08:45.662 --> 08:47.121
You look great,
Dave.

08:47.288 --> 08:50.291
That sweater makes you look
like a cozy grandpa.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.918
Thanks, Theodore.

08:52.627 --> 08:54.837
Okay, where was I?
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

08:55.004 --> 08:57.465
Brother.
Hit the ball, already!

08:57.632 --> 08:58.633
Okay!

08:59.509 --> 09:00.969
Look at it soar!

09:01.135 --> 09:02.637
Follow me, come on guys!

09:02.804 --> 09:03.805
WOW.

09:03.930 --> 09:04.889
Awesome!

09:04.973 --> 09:06.266
Come on!

09:07.183 --> 09:09.352
Follow the ball!
Through the mouth!

09:09.519 --> 09:11.020
Open wide!
Whoo-hoo!

09:11.479 --> 09:12.480
Hurry up!

09:13.815 --> 09:14.983
Hurry, Theodore!

09:15.149 --> 09:16.109
I'm going as fast as I can!

09:16.192 --> 09:17.235
Turn, turn!

09:17.318 --> 09:18.987
My wind calculations
were accurate!

09:19.320 --> 09:20.321
Come On, guys!

09:20.488 --> 09:21.781
My gosh! My gosh!

09:22.115 --> 09:23.199
It's a hole-in...

09:23.366 --> 09:26.327
No! Why?

09:26.494 --> 09:28.454
Excuse me,
that's my brother's ball.

09:28.705 --> 09:30.498
This ball?

09:30.665 --> 09:31.874
No, no, this is my ball.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.835
What? I just hit
that beautiful shot.

09:34.002 --> 09:35.253
Tell you what,
let's compromise,

09:35.336 --> 09:37.839
and we'll call it...
no one's ball.

09:38.172 --> 09:39.173
Hey!

09:39.340 --> 09:40.341
I'm warning you.

09:40.466 --> 09:43.011
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

09:43.177 --> 09:44.220
Yeah!
Aw.

09:44.387 --> 09:45.638
I'm terrified.

09:47.515 --> 09:48.641
What, what? Ouch! Wait!

09:48.808 --> 09:49.851
What are you gonna do?

09:50.018 --> 09:53.146
We will continue this
conversation when I'm back.

09:53.646 --> 09:54.981
Hey, dude,
it's your turn.

09:55.064 --> 09:56.190
Yeah.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.151
Whatever!
I don't even need that ball!

09:58.693 --> 10:00.445
Si's right,
you're not worth it!

10:00.528 --> 10:01.654
Yeah!

10:02.864 --> 10:03.948
Dave,
thank goodness.

10:04.032 --> 10:05.033
Hey, Dave.

10:05.158 --> 10:07.243
Hey, guys. This is Samantha.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.329
Sam, these are my boys.
Hi.

10:09.495 --> 10:10.913
Hi.
That's Theodore.

10:11.039 --> 10:11.998
He might be the smallest,

10:12.081 --> 10:13.124
but he's got
the biggest heart.

10:13.207 --> 10:14.208
Hi.

10:14.334 --> 10:15.835
Ooh, we've heard
a lot about you.

10:17.045 --> 10:18.338
<i>Enchanté.</i>

10:19.589 --> 10:22.050
I can tell
that you're trouble.

10:22.216 --> 10:24.969
If by "trouble,"
you mean "irresistible,"

10:25.053 --> 10:26.679
then guilty as charged.

10:26.846 --> 10:29.265
Alvin, of course.
And there's Simon.

10:29.432 --> 10:30.475
So, you're a doctor?

10:30.558 --> 10:31.601
I am.

10:31.684 --> 10:32.685
Did Dave mention that?

10:32.769 --> 10:35.688
No, you're wearing
a stethoscope.

10:37.190 --> 10:39.567
Yes, I am.
That's embarrassing.

10:40.026 --> 10:41.611
Would it
be okay if I tried it?

10:41.736 --> 10:43.029
Yeah, knock yourself out.

10:43.196 --> 10:44.197
Thank you.

10:45.073 --> 10:48.242
Heart rate is smooth
and steady, 400 BPM.

10:48.409 --> 10:49.744
So, it's beating?

10:49.911 --> 10:51.245
Of course it's beating.

10:51.412 --> 10:53.414
It's so nice to finally
meet you guys.

10:53.581 --> 10:55.917
And this is my son, Miles.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.002
Son?
No.

10:58.086 --> 10:59.212
You guys have a lot in common.

10:59.295 --> 11:00.630
Miles is also a musician.

11:00.755 --> 11:01.964
Yeah, I've heard
you're pretty good.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.049
Thanks, Mr. Seville.

11:03.132 --> 11:04.300
Brother.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.593
We thought this
was the perfect place

11:05.718 --> 11:07.261
for you guys to get to know
each other better.

11:07.428 --> 11:09.430
Yes, so behave, okay?

11:09.597 --> 11:10.973
And Theo, get down from there.

11:11.099 --> 11:12.308
I'll get him.

11:13.434 --> 11:16.145
So, back to our conversation.

11:16.938 --> 11:18.147
No hard feelings?

11:19.899 --> 11:21.275
Hey, YOU guys having fun?

11:21.442 --> 11:23.444
Yeah, just
getting some cotton candy.

11:23.611 --> 11:24.737
All right.

11:26.989 --> 11:29.283
This is not my idea of fun.

11:30.660 --> 11:31.661
Yummy.

11:31.786 --> 11:32.787
Theo!

11:35.623 --> 11:37.083
Alvin,
where did Theodore go?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.585
I don't know, I haven't
seen him since the last hole.

11:39.752 --> 11:40.795
What do you think?

11:40.962 --> 11:43.339
20 bucks seems like
a lot of money for a chipmunk.

11:43.506 --> 11:44.757
He's a talking chipmunk.

11:44.924 --> 11:47.260
Go on, plump and juicy,
say something.

11:47.343 --> 11:48.928
Um, I also sing.

11:57.437 --> 11:58.521
This isn't like Theo,
to wander off.

11:58.646 --> 11:59.647
I know.

11:59.772 --> 12:01.065
Why don't you
check the river?

12:01.149 --> 12:02.150
Chip shot!

12:02.650 --> 12:03.651
Whoa!

12:04.986 --> 12:06.154
Alvin, I found him.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.197
Give us back our brother!
Yeah!

12:08.364 --> 12:09.490
I just paid 20 bucks for him.

12:09.657 --> 12:10.825
He's not for sale!

12:11.534 --> 12:13.161
I want 40.
What?

12:13.327 --> 12:14.537
He's a talking chipmunk.

12:14.704 --> 12:15.705
I also sing.

12:15.872 --> 12:17.498
Theo! You're not helping.

12:29.343 --> 12:30.887
Fine!

12:32.138 --> 12:33.639
I hope you're happy,
Theodore.

12:33.723 --> 12:35.183
That was all of our allowance.

12:35.349 --> 12:37.435
Sorry.
I was born to perform.

12:37.518 --> 12:38.519
Great news, fellas.

12:38.644 --> 12:40.188
You get to hang
with Miles all day.

12:40.646 --> 12:42.690
And the hits
just keep on coming..

12:42.857 --> 12:44.317
Sam got a page
from the hospital,

12:44.400 --> 12:46.319
so I'm going to take you four
to the studio with me.

12:46.486 --> 12:47.528
All right, be good.

12:47.695 --> 12:48.696
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.

12:48.821 --> 12:49.781
Don't forget your stethoscope.

12:49.864 --> 12:50.907
Yeah.

12:51.032 --> 12:51.991
You know what? Keep it.

12:52.074 --> 12:53.075
Thanks.

12:53.201 --> 12:54.202
Break a leg.

12:54.535 --> 12:57.205
That doesn't really apply
to doctors, Dave.

12:57.538 --> 12:58.498
Right.

12:58.581 --> 12:59.707
Good luck!

12:59.874 --> 13:02.001
You kind of hope your heart
surgeon doesn't need luck.

13:02.168 --> 13:03.878
... Have fun!

13:05.755 --> 13:06.923
Nailed it!

13:19.560 --> 13:21.103
Look, paparazzi.

13:21.854 --> 13:23.731
I guess they heard
we were coming.

13:24.065 --> 13:27.735
Hey, guys!
It is good to see you.

13:27.944 --> 13:28.986
Can you get one more
from this side?

13:29.070 --> 13:30.238
Yeah.

13:30.404 --> 13:32.073
Guys, they aren't
here for you, come on.

13:32.573 --> 13:33.616
There she is! Ashley!

13:54.095 --> 13:55.888
Hey!
What the heck?

13:56.055 --> 13:57.807
Nice, Miles.
Yuck!

14:00.059 --> 14:01.102
No!
Hey!

14:02.603 --> 14:04.063
Hey, down here!

14:04.230 --> 14:05.273
Watch it, hey!

14:05.439 --> 14:06.899
- That's my tail!
- Excuse me.

14:07.066 --> 14:10.111
First, can you guys apologize
for trampling my friends?

14:11.612 --> 14:13.614
Aw, sorry about that, guys.

14:13.781 --> 14:14.907
Thank you, Ashley.
Sure.

14:14.991 --> 14:16.117
Miss Grey, when
are you going back on tour?

14:16.827 --> 14:17.828
Miss Grey, over here.

14:17.912 --> 14:18.871
Hey, you know what?

14:18.954 --> 14:20.247
Let me,
let me get this for you.

14:20.956 --> 14:23.334
You know,
I think it's "Push."

14:24.001 --> 14:25.795
Yeah,
you know, of course.

14:26.962 --> 14:28.631
Whoa. Okay.

14:30.132 --> 14:33.636
Looks like Mr. Macho isn't
as cool as he thinks he is.

14:39.517 --> 14:40.851
Man.

14:41.018 --> 14:42.937
I didn't realize
how boring it is

14:43.020 --> 14:44.647
to be on this side
of the glass.

14:45.523 --> 14:46.982
Yeah, why aren't
you guys in there?

14:47.149 --> 14:49.485
I thought you were, like,
super famous or something?

14:50.194 --> 14:52.613
One day, you're throwing back
pink lemonades

14:52.696 --> 14:54.323
on Diddy's yacht
in Saint-Tropez...

14:54.490 --> 14:55.699
Ooh, jackpot!

14:55.866 --> 14:57.868
...and the next,
you're eating stale chips

14:57.993 --> 14:59.203
you find in the couch.

14:59.370 --> 15:01.038
I miss it.

15:01.163 --> 15:04.542
... Theodore, couch
chips are for talent only.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.127
Really, Barry?

15:07.670 --> 15:10.339
All right, you can keep it.
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

15:10.548 --> 15:12.007
Whoo-hoo! Yum.

15:14.678 --> 15:15.679
<i>We did it!</i>

15:15.804 --> 15:18.139
We successfully introduced
our kids to each other.

15:18.306 --> 15:20.350
And then, you performed
open-heart surgery.

15:20.517 --> 15:21.935
Please, after being
a single mom

15:22.018 --> 15:23.728
and a med student,
I could do this in my sleep.

15:25.313 --> 15:27.524
And I wore my stethoscope
out again, didn't I?

15:28.066 --> 15:29.484
I thought it was cute.

15:29.651 --> 15:32.237
And I like people to know
I'm dating a doctor.

15:33.905 --> 15:35.240
All right, I guess my life

15:35.365 --> 15:37.534
is a little more hectic
than I'd like to admit.

15:37.701 --> 15:38.702
I get it.

15:39.536 --> 15:42.247
So, I have to ask. The boys?

15:42.414 --> 15:44.666
Are they, like,
your adopted kids, or...

15:44.833 --> 15:45.834
How does that work?

15:46.001 --> 15:48.253
I don't know, I never really
thought about it.

15:50.755 --> 15:51.840
What?

15:53.675 --> 15:55.218
They're lucky to have you.

15:58.346 --> 15:59.347
Crazy idea.

16:00.724 --> 16:02.225
Have you ever been to Miami?

16:05.103 --> 16:07.772
<i>This is</i> American Idol!

16:09.399 --> 16:11.234
<i>I'm sorry
to have to do this...</i>

16:11.568 --> 16:13.570
<i>but you're going to Hollywood!</i>

16:14.904 --> 16:18.199
I've always
wanted to say that!

16:18.366 --> 16:21.077
Why did they get to move out
and do all this cool stuff?

16:21.244 --> 16:22.412
Well, Alvin...

16:22.579 --> 16:24.331
girls are
scientifically proven

16:24.414 --> 16:25.915
to mature faster than boys.

16:26.082 --> 16:27.250
Whatever.

16:27.792 --> 16:28.793
Hey, guys.

16:28.918 --> 16:29.878
- Dave!
- Hi.

16:29.961 --> 16:31.296
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up

16:31.421 --> 16:32.422
a few things on the way home.

16:32.547 --> 16:34.466
No worries,
we've just been ruminating

16:34.591 --> 16:36.092
on why we still live at home.

16:36.259 --> 16:37.761
So, what'd you guys
think of Samantha?

16:37.927 --> 16:38.970
She's awesome.

16:39.137 --> 16:40.180
We loved her.

16:40.513 --> 16:42.599
Ooh, leftovers.

16:46.061 --> 16:47.729
Ooh, I can't wait.

16:47.896 --> 16:50.982
I can taste it.
Yes! Yummy.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.943
I can't eat this.

16:54.110 --> 16:57.072
Whoa! That is a serious
engagement ring.

16:57.405 --> 16:59.949
Wait a second. That means
Dave is going to ask

17:00.075 --> 17:01.826
Samantha to marry him.

17:01.993 --> 17:03.787
Hold on, we don't know that.

17:03.953 --> 17:05.622
They've only been together
a few months,

17:05.747 --> 17:07.457
so you're probably
overreacting.

17:07.624 --> 17:08.625
But what if it's true?

17:09.959 --> 17:11.169
Here he comes.

17:11.336 --> 17:12.337
Act casual.

17:15.924 --> 17:17.342
What are you guys doing?

17:18.801 --> 17:21.096
Yoga. Downward munk?

17:21.262 --> 17:22.222
Well, that's great
to hear that

17:22.305 --> 17:23.973
you guys like Samantha,
because“.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.974
She's gonna become
a big part of my life.

17:26.434 --> 17:27.519
And good news.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.479
My plus one
isn't going to waste.

17:29.813 --> 17:31.523
She is coming
to Miami with me.

17:34.692 --> 17:37.987
I'm standing right here.
I can hear what he's saying.

17:48.581 --> 17:50.250
I've always wanted a mom.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.334
Guys...

17:51.418 --> 17:55.004
...if Samantha is our mom,
that makes Miles...

17:55.171 --> 17:56.256
Our brother.

17:59.509 --> 18:01.010
No!

18:01.845 --> 18:03.847
Deep breaths, Theodore.
In and out.

18:04.013 --> 18:05.557
It's going to be okay.

18:05.723 --> 18:07.267
What are we gonna do?

18:08.351 --> 18:09.519
Guys, it's time.

18:09.853 --> 18:12.564
Operation ring retrieval
is a go.

18:12.730 --> 18:14.691
No ring, no proposal.

18:14.858 --> 18:17.068
No proposal, no Miles.

18:17.235 --> 18:18.736
Theo, fall in line, soldier.

18:18.903 --> 18:20.363
Brother.

18:31.124 --> 18:33.418
Alvin, what...
Are we doing a charade?

18:34.794 --> 18:36.421
Cool. Two words.

18:36.588 --> 18:38.047
No.

18:38.715 --> 18:40.216
First down? What are you...

18:40.800 --> 18:42.594
Two syllables. Sounds like.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.887
Is it a movie? First word.

18:44.053 --> 18:45.054
A song?

18:45.221 --> 18:46.222
Angry.
Get over here.

18:46.389 --> 18:47.390
Okay.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.267
Still no idea
what you're saying.

18:49.893 --> 18:51.102
Theodore, you keep
an eye on Dave.

18:51.227 --> 18:53.104
Simon and I will get the ring.

19:01.237 --> 19:03.072
There you are.

19:03.781 --> 19:05.158
Alvin, grab this.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.251
Let's do this.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.512
Yes!

19:25.678 --> 19:27.430
The bag's gone.
No.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.474
You mean that bag over there?

19:30.266 --> 19:31.434
And I'm back to "Yes."

19:32.644 --> 19:33.645
And right back to "No."

19:33.770 --> 19:35.438
Abort. Abort. Let's go.

19:39.943 --> 19:40.985
Guys...

19:41.653 --> 19:43.196
what are you doing in here?

19:43.947 --> 19:45.949
... Well... We...

19:46.115 --> 19:48.326
just wanted to spend
as much time as possible

19:48.451 --> 19:50.537
with you before
you left for Miami.

19:50.703 --> 19:51.788
Yeah.

19:51.955 --> 19:53.623
All right.
I'll make breakfast.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.833
Whoo-hoo! I love breakfast.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.460
Alvin, grab it.

19:57.794 --> 20:01.506
Ooh, ooh, Belgian waffles,
pancakes. So excited.

20:12.850 --> 20:13.851
Okay, guys--

20:14.018 --> 20:16.479
Miss Price from next door,
she's gonna peek in on you...

20:16.646 --> 20:17.814
make sure you're all right.

20:17.981 --> 20:19.482
What? She's nuts.

20:19.649 --> 20:21.901
We should be the ones
checking in on her.

20:22.068 --> 20:23.820
Well, after that big party
you guys threw...

20:23.987 --> 20:25.530
I don't feel very comfortable
with you guys

20:25.655 --> 20:27.448
staying here unsupervised.
You got it?

20:28.658 --> 20:29.993
That must be
Samantha and Miles.

20:31.244 --> 20:32.328
Miles?

20:32.495 --> 20:34.330
Yeah, he's going to stay
with you guys for a few days.

20:34.497 --> 20:36.958
So, you don't feel comfortable
leaving us alone,

20:37.041 --> 20:40.253
but you're okay leaving us
with that psychopath?

20:40.420 --> 20:41.754
No, he's a great kid.

20:41.921 --> 20:42.922
It'll be fun.

20:43.089 --> 20:44.299
You know, it'll be,

20:44.382 --> 20:46.342
a good bonding experience
for you guys.

20:46.509 --> 20:48.761
I'm pretty sure
Miles would interpret

20:48.845 --> 20:51.681
"bonding experience"
as super-gluing us together.

20:52.265 --> 20:53.433
Hi.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.726
Wow. Great place.

20:54.892 --> 20:56.060
Thanks.

20:56.227 --> 20:57.437
Make yourself at home.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.188
<i>Mi</i> casa, su casa.

20:59.355 --> 21:03.067
Thank you, David, that's very
generous of you to open your home.

21:03.359 --> 21:05.403
Wow. That's really impressive.

21:05.862 --> 21:07.196
I actually don't
speak Spanish.

21:07.363 --> 21:08.531
He said that it's
very generous

21:08.615 --> 21:10.033
of you to open your home.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.493
I also speak Spanish.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.954
And you're not fooling anyone
with your good boy routine.

21:15.204 --> 21:17.040
I'm fooling everyone.

21:17.165 --> 21:21.544
They have no idea that I'm going
to make you my personal servant.

21:22.754 --> 21:25.381
All right. I guess this is it.
Have a great weekend, guys.

21:25.548 --> 21:26.549
And boys...

21:26.633 --> 21:28.885
try to show me you can handle
some independence, okay?

21:28.968 --> 21:30.011
All right, bye, sweetie.
Be good.

21:30.094 --> 21:31.220
Okay.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.973
All right. Here we go.

21:34.140 --> 21:35.975
I can feel the bonding
happening already.

21:37.226 --> 21:39.812
We're gonna be doing
tons of bonding.

21:41.564 --> 21:43.107
Where's the Super Glue?

21:46.277 --> 21:48.237
Miles, if we're going
to make this work,

21:48.321 --> 21:49.614
we need to talk.

21:49.781 --> 21:50.990
Feels like it's working.

21:51.157 --> 21:52.575
But, good talk.

21:52.742 --> 21:54.744
You can't shut us out forever.

21:54.911 --> 21:56.245
He means emotionally, but...

21:56.412 --> 21:57.830
I want to focus
on the physically

21:57.914 --> 21:59.582
shutting us out
of our own home part.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.000
I have to pee.

22:01.084 --> 22:02.168
You guys are so naive.

22:02.293 --> 22:04.420
Trust me, this thing with
Dave and my mom is temporary.

22:04.587 --> 22:07.590
If by temporary you mean,
"till death do they part"...

22:07.757 --> 22:09.342
then yeah. Totally temporary.

22:09.801 --> 22:10.843
What are you talking about?

22:11.010 --> 22:12.970
He's talking
about marriage, Miles.

22:13.096 --> 22:14.305
Wedding bells.

22:14.430 --> 22:17.517
Dave liked it and he's
gonna put a ring on it.

22:20.853 --> 22:21.979
A bag of tissue.

22:22.146 --> 22:23.606
What?
Scandalous.

22:23.773 --> 22:24.816
It's gone.

22:24.982 --> 22:26.359
He must have
packed the ring

22:26.442 --> 22:27.777
last night before bed.

22:27.860 --> 22:30.113
He's going to
propose to Samantha in Miami.

22:30.279 --> 22:31.614
So you think we're
all gonna become, like,

22:31.698 --> 22:33.199
one big happy family?

22:33.366 --> 22:35.368
No one said happy.
No offense to your mom.

22:35.451 --> 22:36.911
She actually seems
quite wonderful.

22:36.994 --> 22:39.288
Yeah. It's you
we're not thrilled about.

22:39.455 --> 22:40.665
Well, the feeling is mutual.

22:40.832 --> 22:42.709
And you guys
can keep Dave too.

22:42.875 --> 22:43.876
My dad died when I was little

22:43.960 --> 22:45.294
and I've done
just fine without one.

22:45.670 --> 22:48.214
I'm sorry, Miles.

22:48.631 --> 22:50.299
Don't be. I didn't know him.

22:50.842 --> 22:52.385
If Dave and my mom
do get married...

22:52.468 --> 22:53.469
they'll wanna have
their own kids.

22:53.553 --> 22:55.221
And you're not even
Dave's real sons...

22:55.304 --> 22:56.389
you'rejust a bunch
of chipmunks

22:56.472 --> 22:57.557
that he calls his kids.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.641
Before you guys know it,

22:58.725 --> 23:00.059
you'll be back
out in the forest.

23:00.309 --> 23:02.186
Holding your nuts all winter.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.271
Hey.

23:03.354 --> 23:04.981
First of all,
that's what squirrels do.

23:05.064 --> 23:06.482
We are chipmunks.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.026
Um, Alvin,
chipmunks do that too.

23:09.193 --> 23:10.987
And the fact that
I didn't know that...

23:11.154 --> 23:14.240
is exactly why we cannot
end up back in the forest.

23:15.324 --> 23:16.993
But... Dave wouldn't
do that to us.

23:17.076 --> 23:18.077
He already has.

23:18.494 --> 23:20.747
Why do you think you guys are
here and my mom's in Miami?

23:21.205 --> 23:22.707
Meeting of the Munks.

23:22.874 --> 23:25.710
I don't want Miles to be right
any more than you do,

23:25.835 --> 23:27.336
but it all kind of lines up.

23:27.503 --> 23:31.591
Newjob, new house,
new girlfriend, new family.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.676
I don't want to go back
to the forest.

23:33.843 --> 23:37.638
And I am definitely not going
to end up related to that guy.

23:39.682 --> 23:41.267
Nice form.

23:41.768 --> 23:42.894
Here's the deal, Miles.

23:43.060 --> 23:45.438
We all go to Miami
to stop this proposal...

23:45.605 --> 23:48.608
and then we never have to
see each other again.

23:48.900 --> 23:49.942
I'm in.

23:50.109 --> 23:51.861
Can't get you chipmunks
out of my life fast enough.

23:52.028 --> 23:53.821
That's the smartest thing
you've said

23:53.905 --> 23:55.281
since we met you.

23:56.032 --> 23:57.074
Are you sure there's

23:57.200 --> 23:58.201
enough money
in your piggy bank?

23:58.284 --> 23:59.786
Guys, it's a credit card.

23:59.869 --> 24:01.621
We'll get 4 tickets.
Stop worrying.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.080
Hello, boys.

24:03.247 --> 24:04.373
Hey, Miss Price.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.709
I'm supposed to be
keeping an eye on you...

24:07.210 --> 24:09.086
so I think I'll use...

24:09.545 --> 24:10.713
this one.

24:17.970 --> 24:20.056
How are we gonna get to Miami
if she's gonna be watching us?

24:20.223 --> 24:22.975
Guys, I have a plan.

24:23.267 --> 24:26.312
The 4 words
society fears most.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.731
I can't believe that worked.

24:28.898 --> 24:30.316
It wasn't so much me

24:30.399 --> 24:32.944
as it was the peanuts
dipped in cough syrup.

24:36.489 --> 24:37.782
That's really messed up.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.409
Respect.
Thank you!

24:40.743 --> 24:42.578
Alvin, these aren't
even chipmunks.

24:42.745 --> 24:43.746
They're squirrels.

24:43.913 --> 24:45.331
Beggars
can't be choosers.

24:45.665 --> 24:47.708
Besides, once we put them
in the shirts

24:47.792 --> 24:49.669
from the Alvin, Simon
and Theodore dolls...

24:49.836 --> 24:52.505
Miss Price won't be able to
tell the difference.

24:52.922 --> 24:54.173
Yeah, let's do it.

24:54.298 --> 24:56.592
Ooh... I get to change me!

25:01.430 --> 25:02.390
I can't believe
I maxed out my mom's

25:02.473 --> 25:03.766
entire card
in this one ticket.

25:03.933 --> 25:06.102
We're fine.
Just stick to the plan.

25:06.269 --> 25:09.272
I'm starting to think I should
go through cargo with Theo.

25:09.355 --> 25:10.356
Shh.

25:10.523 --> 25:12.149
Be silent. Be still.

25:12.775 --> 25:14.360
And you. Get in there.

25:14.527 --> 25:15.528
Easy!

25:15.695 --> 25:16.737
- Both of you guys.
- Watch the zipper.

25:16.821 --> 25:17.822
Next!

25:17.947 --> 25:19.782
Who knows what
you're carrying in this thing.

25:30.626 --> 25:31.794
Go on through.

25:36.465 --> 25:37.508
Whoa!

25:38.301 --> 25:39.468
What's that?

25:39.969 --> 25:43.639
That is a...
stuffed Alvin doll.

25:43.806 --> 25:47.351
You know, from that lame
singing chipmunks group.

25:48.144 --> 25:49.312
Um, yeah.

25:49.687 --> 25:51.647
I'm gonna need to see what's
in that backpack, please.

25:51.814 --> 25:52.815
No.

25:53.149 --> 25:54.650
Yeah.

25:56.861 --> 25:58.154
Um, it's just a doll.

25:58.321 --> 25:59.655
Chucky was just a doll.

26:02.658 --> 26:04.493
This is Alvin.
It's what the "A" is for.

26:05.703 --> 26:08.331
He does a lot of bending
and back up.

26:08.998 --> 26:10.374
He does splits.

26:12.335 --> 26:14.003
He can twist.

26:14.837 --> 26:18.341
Like Linda Blair almost.

26:18.549 --> 26:21.260
You can use it
as a weight-loss device.

26:23.429 --> 26:24.430
I can feel the sweat.

26:25.806 --> 26:27.558
It even talks.

26:27.725 --> 26:31.520
It says,
"I'm a dumb stupid-head."

26:36.359 --> 26:39.528
Sorry, the batteries
might be a bit low.

26:39.695 --> 26:41.447
I'm a dumb stupid-head!

26:42.782 --> 26:43.908
So, he's...!

26:45.034 --> 26:46.243
And it bites.

26:46.410 --> 26:47.912
I think that was just
a design flaw.

26:48.037 --> 26:49.455
There's probably a recall.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.375
You can put the doll
back in the bag.

26:53.876 --> 26:54.919
Not the dark place!

26:55.086 --> 26:56.087
What I am gonna need...

26:56.253 --> 26:58.297
is for you to take a step
right over there...

26:58.464 --> 27:01.717
because we're gonna need to
do a quick body search.

27:02.885 --> 27:03.928
Body search?

27:04.095 --> 27:05.137
Body search!

27:07.139 --> 27:08.766
Good luck, Simon!
Yeah.

27:10.476 --> 27:11.477
Okay.

27:12.144 --> 27:13.729
No.

27:13.896 --> 27:15.398
Where to hide, where to hide?

27:16.732 --> 27:17.733
Relax.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.443
Put your arms out.
They're out.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.117
One last spot to get.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.243
I don't wanna
go to jail.

27:27.326 --> 27:28.744
I don't wanna go to jail!

27:38.421 --> 27:39.672
That's not mine.

27:39.922 --> 27:41.507
You just holding it
for a friend?

27:42.133 --> 27:44.010
No, no,
not that, not that.

27:52.351 --> 27:54.103
I don't get paid enough.

27:54.270 --> 27:55.271
Get out of here.

27:55.855 --> 27:57.023
<i>Real smooth, Simon.</i>

27:57.398 --> 27:59.608
I'm sorry!
I just, I got so nervous.

27:59.692 --> 28:00.735
You are lucky I don't flush

28:00.818 --> 28:01.986
the both of you
down the toilet!

28:02.111 --> 28:04.030
Well, I'm glad we sent
Theodore to Baggage.

28:04.321 --> 28:06.615
He never would have
made it through Security.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.618
Wow! Hi, everyone!

28:10.119 --> 28:11.996
Cold in here, isn't it?

28:13.873 --> 28:16.834
Whoa!

28:20.129 --> 28:21.922
Miles, will you ask
a flight attendant

28:22.006 --> 28:23.466
for some peanuts?
We're hungry.

28:23.632 --> 28:25.342
Yeah. I too would
love a water.

28:25.509 --> 28:27.553
But no ice.
It's supposed to be filthy.

28:27.636 --> 28:28.637
Ooh, which reminds me.

28:28.721 --> 28:29.722
Germs,
germs, go away,

28:29.805 --> 28:31.098
don't come back
any other day, okay.

28:31.265 --> 28:32.975
Shut up and stay out of sight.

28:33.142 --> 28:34.185
Hey! Easy!

28:34.351 --> 28:35.436
It smells in here.

28:35.603 --> 28:38.355
If you're not gonna feed us,
I'm going to forage.

28:38.522 --> 28:39.857
Not a great idea, Alvin.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.817
We're not legitimate
passengers!

28:45.654 --> 28:47.198
Oops! Sorry!

28:48.866 --> 28:50.367
I didn't mean to startle you.

28:50.534 --> 28:52.661
I'm not startled.

28:52.995 --> 28:54.330
It's just you're...

28:54.497 --> 28:55.498
You're you.

28:55.664 --> 28:56.832
I am me.

28:56.999 --> 28:59.001
And, you know,
if you have a pen...

28:59.168 --> 29:01.796
I'm always happy to
sign an autograph for a fan.

29:04.048 --> 29:05.508
I'm not a fan.

29:05.674 --> 29:07.927
Okay.

29:09.762 --> 29:12.515
Well, um, I'll be seeing you.

29:13.265 --> 29:15.726
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Coming through.

29:15.893 --> 29:19.730
Now where in this tin can
can I get some snacks?

29:30.950 --> 29:32.868
On, baby!

29:38.332 --> 29:39.917
Hi! I'm Theodore.

29:40.417 --> 29:41.585
Shh.

29:41.710 --> 29:43.254
Inside voice.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.965
Please stop.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.384
You're gonna make
the other animals nervous!

29:54.390 --> 29:56.225
Okay, I'll let you out.

29:56.392 --> 29:58.727
But you have to promise
to go back in before we land.

30:02.231 --> 30:03.983
Got it. There you go!

30:04.316 --> 30:06.569
Thank you, friend.

30:12.116 --> 30:13.117
Hey!

30:13.993 --> 30:15.953
Please, everyone relax!

30:16.245 --> 30:18.455
Um, Mister Monkey? Wha...

30:18.622 --> 30:20.082
Wait! Don't do that.

30:20.916 --> 30:22.501
No. Bad monkey!

30:23.794 --> 30:24.837
I asked you to stop!

30:24.920 --> 30:26.338
Hey! Please!

30:26.589 --> 30:28.174
I'm begging you, Monkey Man!

30:38.100 --> 30:39.101
What?

30:39.185 --> 30:41.395
You've never seen a chipmunk
in first class before?

30:41.478 --> 30:44.315
Actually, I recently flew
next to The Chipettes

30:44.440 --> 30:45.774
and they were ladies.

30:45.983 --> 30:48.861
<i>Hey. Don't judge me.</i>
I <i>saw Pink Flamingos.</i>

30:49.028 --> 30:51.113
Excuse me.
May I see your boarding pass?

30:51.280 --> 30:54.783
Yeah, well,
funny thing about that.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.160
Ha! Gotta run!

30:56.285 --> 30:57.286
Come here.

30:59.872 --> 31:01.040
Get back here!

31:03.375 --> 31:04.460
Simon! Run!

31:04.627 --> 31:05.669
Where? We're on a plane.

31:05.836 --> 31:07.463
I don't know! Come on.

31:09.381 --> 31:10.466
Freeze!

31:11.467 --> 31:12.968
Air marshal.

31:13.135 --> 31:14.637
Don't move.

31:16.013 --> 31:17.556
Can we move now?

31:17.890 --> 31:20.851
This is a very
hard pose to hold.

31:22.478 --> 31:23.479
What's that?

31:26.148 --> 31:27.983
This can't be good.

31:30.903 --> 31:31.987
What the...

31:33.489 --> 31:34.657
What? What?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.951
All right!
Everybody calm down!

31:37.034 --> 31:39.203
It's just a monkey. All right?

31:39.370 --> 31:40.913
Birds! Birds!

31:43.040 --> 31:45.709
Help! Someone save me!

31:45.876 --> 31:47.169
Nice doggy...

31:48.170 --> 31:49.546
Theo! Over here! Jump!

31:50.547 --> 31:52.049
Birds and dogs!

31:52.383 --> 31:53.842
My God!

31:54.260 --> 31:55.552
Okay, now there's a goat.

31:56.762 --> 31:59.014
And an otter.
And an otter! God!

31:59.181 --> 32:01.308
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

32:01.392 --> 32:02.393
Listen!

32:02.518 --> 32:03.519
<i>We're going to be making an...</i>

32:03.602 --> 32:05.562
<i>emergency landing
in Austin, Texas</i>

32:05.688 --> 32:07.690
<i>due to a herd of
chinchillas in the cockpit.</i>

32:07.773 --> 32:08.774
All right, you heard him!

32:08.941 --> 32:10.401
The plane's going down.

32:12.736 --> 32:14.863
Not down like down-down.

32:14.947 --> 32:17.741
Safely-safely.
We're not crashing!

32:18.742 --> 32:19.910
You people are idiots!

32:20.077 --> 32:21.287
We're all gonna die!

32:21.453 --> 32:22.454
What an idiot!

32:22.621 --> 32:24.540
Great speech, Churchill.

32:24.707 --> 32:26.292
You better watch it!

32:26.458 --> 32:27.835
Do you know who
you're talking to?

32:27.918 --> 32:29.920
I am the police of the sky!

32:33.257 --> 32:34.383
Really?

32:36.927 --> 32:37.970
<i>Okay.
Let's make sure</i>

32:38.053 --> 32:39.221
<i>we have everything.</i>

32:39.388 --> 32:40.806
You released animals
from cargo,

32:40.889 --> 32:42.599
and then you forced
an emergency landing.

32:42.766 --> 32:44.393
We also snuck onto the plane.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.186
That's right.
Theodore!

32:46.353 --> 32:49.273
That is three major
infractions on one flight.

32:49.523 --> 32:50.566
Here's a fun fact.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.943
That's three more infractions
than I've ever had

32:53.027 --> 32:54.445
in all my years
as an air marshal.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.905
Congratulations on such
a distinguished career, sir.

32:57.656 --> 32:59.033
Did you hear that?

32:59.199 --> 33:01.285
Because of that
"distinguished career"...

33:01.452 --> 33:03.120
I've got a meeting
with Homeland Security

33:03.203 --> 33:04.288
next week about a promotion.

33:04.496 --> 33:06.081
Another congratulations, sir.
Shut up!

33:06.165 --> 33:07.166
What do you think
they're gonna bring up

33:07.249 --> 33:08.375
when they interview me?

33:08.459 --> 33:11.712
My decade
of perfect service...

33:11.879 --> 33:13.881
or that one time
that three chipmunks

33:13.964 --> 33:16.091
turned my flight
into Noah's Ark?

33:16.383 --> 33:18.302
Probably the time
with the chipmunks.

33:18.385 --> 33:19.428
Yeah.

33:20.846 --> 33:22.765
Um, I meant the other one.

33:22.931 --> 33:25.351
Look, sir, what could
we possibly have done

33:25.434 --> 33:26.685
to make you hate us so much?

33:30.022 --> 33:31.982
I'll tell you what you did.

33:32.816 --> 33:33.817
Whoa!

33:33.942 --> 33:34.943
Holy Christmas.

33:37.196 --> 33:38.822
I got a little
early gift for you.

33:39.031 --> 33:40.491
James.

33:41.075 --> 33:42.368
You shouldn't have.

33:42.493 --> 33:43.494
No. Wait a second.

33:43.577 --> 33:45.871
I want to lnstagram
a video of your reaction.

33:46.872 --> 33:48.374
Merry Christmas!
I'm breaking up with you!

33:48.540 --> 33:49.625
What?

33:50.834 --> 33:51.835
Thanks.

33:53.212 --> 33:54.254
And The Chipmunks?

33:54.880 --> 33:56.048
Grow up, James.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.424
Wait.

34:09.603 --> 34:10.813
<i>Awkward .</i>

34:11.271 --> 34:14.440
You provided the soundtrack
to my heartbreak.

34:14.608 --> 34:16.443
But now it's payback time.

34:16.610 --> 34:20.489
I am putting you three on the
No-Fly List.

34:20.656 --> 34:21.864
What? No!
But we have to get to Miami!

34:21.949 --> 34:23.033
You can't do that!

34:23.117 --> 34:25.202
You see, I'm an air marshal.

34:25.369 --> 34:26.870
I'm all-powerful...

34:27.036 --> 34:28.371
I'm all-seeing...

34:28.539 --> 34:30.791
and I'm all-knowing.

34:30.958 --> 34:32.208
Then you obviously know

34:32.292 --> 34:33.877
you just made
that entire speech...

34:34.043 --> 34:35.712
with your tie
in a cup of coffee.

34:36.338 --> 34:38.132
Okay.

34:39.632 --> 34:41.092
I'll be back in two minutes.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.429
You also still have a little
parrot poop on your shirt.

34:44.596 --> 34:45.597
10 minutes.

34:45.889 --> 34:47.056
And one more thing.

34:47.224 --> 34:49.016
Don't even think
about leaving.

34:49.393 --> 34:51.728
I have a very particular
set of skills.

34:51.895 --> 34:53.480
Skills that I have acquired
over a very long...

34:53.647 --> 34:55.774
You just put your hand
on an ink pad.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.737
15 minutes.

35:06.285 --> 35:09.079
Whoa. That guy is the mayor
of Crazy Town.

35:09.246 --> 35:11.748
We gotta get you out of here,
now. Let's go.

35:14.209 --> 35:15.919
This is gonna be
the best...

35:19.965 --> 35:21.633
- Come on!
- Really?

35:23.135 --> 35:26.513
Nobody runs on
Agent James Suggs.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.735
Come on. Come on. Go.

35:39.902 --> 35:41.695
Here you go.
Thanks so much.

35:43.405 --> 35:45.157
Well, that's as far
as my money takes us.

35:45.324 --> 35:48.035
Which puts us 2 hours
and 30 minutes from Miami.

35:48.118 --> 35:49.119
- Hey!
- Yes!

35:49.203 --> 35:50.454
All right!
By plane.

35:50.621 --> 35:52.039
Come on!

35:52.206 --> 35:54.208
Guys, the party
is in three days.

35:54.374 --> 35:56.460
We need to get to Miami. Fast.

35:57.294 --> 36:00.506
And, as if we're not in enough
trouble already, it's Dave.

36:00.672 --> 36:01.965
Man.

36:02.132 --> 36:03.634
Well, we cannot
possibly pick up.

36:03.759 --> 36:04.760
We have to pick up,

36:04.843 --> 36:06.220
or Dave will know
something is wrong.

36:06.386 --> 36:07.679
Dave's gonna know
something's wrong

36:07.763 --> 36:09.723
when he sees us standing
around a bunch of trash cans,

36:09.806 --> 36:12.142
in a parking lot
in the middle of nowhere!

36:12.226 --> 36:13.519
Good point.

36:14.895 --> 36:15.896
Ready to go eat?

36:16.355 --> 36:17.397
... Yeah.

36:17.481 --> 36:18.482
Everything okay?

36:18.607 --> 36:20.025
Let me check on something.

36:20.859 --> 36:21.860
Hello?

36:22.027 --> 36:23.445
Hi, it's Dave. Are you busy?

36:23.612 --> 36:25.030
<i>Hi, Dave.</i>

36:25.280 --> 36:26.782
No, I'm not busy at all.

36:26.865 --> 36:29.826
No, I'm just dining
with a friend.

36:29.993 --> 36:30.994
What do you need?

36:31.161 --> 36:32.162
All right, I'm gonna
take a look.

36:32.246 --> 36:33.288
I'm right at the window.

36:35.457 --> 36:37.584
No!

36:39.753 --> 36:41.338
They've eaten everything!

36:42.923 --> 36:44.883
And I mean everything!

36:45.050 --> 36:46.301
Yeah, that sounds about right.

36:46.468 --> 36:48.679
Just like a guinea pig
Armageddon!

36:48.845 --> 36:50.889
Well, thanks for checking
on them, Miss Price.

36:53.225 --> 36:54.268
False alarm.

36:54.351 --> 36:55.352
Soundsfike
they're having a blast.

36:55.435 --> 36:56.436
Good.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.813
You ready?
Yeah.

37:01.149 --> 37:04.528
Um, Alvin, I think maybe we
should go somewhere else.

37:04.695 --> 37:07.447
Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas.
21 and over.

37:07.614 --> 37:08.907
But it's dark outside,

37:08.991 --> 37:10.450
and we don't have
anywhere else to go.

37:10.617 --> 37:11.994
Well, I wish I could
help you out,

37:12.077 --> 37:13.453
but I got a bar
packed with people...

37:13.620 --> 37:14.830
waiting to hear a band

37:14.913 --> 37:17.457
whose singer is stuck 50 miles
from here with a flat tire.

37:17.624 --> 37:19.918
So, unless you guys know
anyone who can carry a tune...

37:20.085 --> 37:21.503
I'm gonna have to
bid you good night.

37:22.296 --> 37:24.923
How would you feel
about some singing chipmunks?

37:25.382 --> 37:26.800
Whoa! You guys really
know The Chipettes?

37:27.259 --> 37:28.260
... Really?

37:28.927 --> 37:30.095
<i>Please welcome, all the way</i>

37:30.178 --> 37:31.513
<i>from Los Angeles,
California...</i>

37:31.680 --> 37:33.015
<i>The Chipmunks.</i>

37:34.308 --> 37:35.309
Ooh!

37:38.895 --> 37:39.980
<i>Warm crowd.</i>

37:40.939 --> 37:42.983
So, can you really play?

37:43.358 --> 37:44.735
Can you really sing?

37:54.083 --> 37:56.335
<i>Whoo! Put your hands
together for me.</i>

37:56.418 --> 37:57.836
<i>Um! Feels good.</i>

37:59.338 --> 38:00.422
<i>Come on, bass.</i>

38:03.842 --> 38:05.094
<i>More guitar.</i>

38:06.637 --> 38:09.765
<i>My man on drums.
We're taking it to the verse.</i>

38:49.888 --> 38:51.431
Wh00!

39:00.482 --> 39:02.359
This is where your guy said he
dropped off the little freaks?

39:02.442 --> 39:04.027
Yeah. That'll be 76 bucks.

39:04.111 --> 39:06.113
Okay. I'm law enforcement,
so...

39:06.196 --> 39:08.115
Great. 76 bucks.

39:08.824 --> 39:11.285
Let me rephrase that.
I'm the police of the sky.

39:11.535 --> 39:13.328
But we're on the ground
and this is a car.

39:13.453 --> 39:14.454
So...

39:14.538 --> 39:15.539
76 bucks.

39:15.622 --> 39:16.623
So, that means nothing to you?

39:16.707 --> 39:17.708
Nope.

39:19.042 --> 39:20.252
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't leave.

39:20.419 --> 39:22.421
The money!
I'm getting it!

39:35.184 --> 39:36.185
Yeah!

39:39.855 --> 39:42.274
It's on.

39:43.069 --> 39:45.155
Alvin,
we've got a problem.

39:45.321 --> 39:46.322
No.

39:46.489 --> 39:48.408
I'll distract him,
you guys make a run for it.

39:48.575 --> 39:49.742
I'll meet you outside.

39:50.326 --> 39:51.870
How dare you!

39:52.662 --> 39:53.997
Over here.

39:55.248 --> 39:56.291
Gotcha!

40:03.131 --> 40:04.215
Let me explain.

40:04.549 --> 40:06.134
I have a reason to believe

40:06.217 --> 40:09.512
there's a fugitive chipmunk
in your beard.

40:09.679 --> 40:11.306
You don't think
I'd know if there was

40:11.389 --> 40:13.808
an animal living in my beard?

40:15.101 --> 40:16.561
I don't.
Beard peanuts?

40:16.728 --> 40:17.729
Gotcha!

40:21.983 --> 40:23.151
Watch where
you're throwing people!

40:23.234 --> 40:24.319
What are you
gonna do about it?

40:34.120 --> 40:35.246
I am so sorry.

40:35.413 --> 40:36.539
Yeah, sorry about the fight.

40:36.706 --> 40:38.249
Ain't no apology necessary.

40:38.416 --> 40:39.626
Nothing better for business

40:39.709 --> 40:41.794
than a good old-fashioned
bar brawl.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.421
Good luck, outlaws.
Thanks.

40:43.588 --> 40:45.965
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, keep it in there!

40:48.259 --> 40:49.302
Yikes!

41:16.287 --> 41:17.997
Ha!

41:18.206 --> 41:19.207
You come on!

41:28.550 --> 41:30.760
I will slice and dice you
like spicy sushi roll!

41:35.848 --> 41:37.225
Missed me!

41:37.308 --> 41:38.309
Ha! Ha!

41:39.310 --> 41:40.562
You want some
butter with that?

41:42.939 --> 41:44.399
Drinks are on you!

41:49.529 --> 41:50.530
What?

42:06.963 --> 42:08.089
Solong,Suggsy!

42:10.049 --> 42:12.010
Get out of the way,
hillbillies!

42:12.176 --> 42:14.637
I need to get out
of this bar ASAP!

42:14.804 --> 42:15.972
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.056
Butwhere's Alvin?

42:17.140 --> 42:18.182
We're gonna leave, man!

42:18.349 --> 42:20.226
I'm waiting on a guy
that owes me 76 bucks.

42:22.562 --> 42:23.563
You mean that guy?

42:24.188 --> 42:25.189
You know what,
we'll double it.

42:25.273 --> 42:26.274
All right.

42:26.357 --> 42:28.067
But Alvin's not here yet!
Forget about him, let's go!

42:28.151 --> 42:29.152
Wait, wait!

42:29.277 --> 42:30.278
There he is, there he is!

42:30.403 --> 42:31.404
You...

42:31.487 --> 42:32.697
Come on, let's go, come on!
Come on, Alvin!

42:32.780 --> 42:33.865
Hurry, hurry!

42:34.032 --> 42:35.074
Miles, give me your belt.

42:35.241 --> 42:37.076
You little hood rats!
Alvin, run!

42:37.243 --> 42:39.329
I will hunt you down!

42:39.662 --> 42:40.705
Slow down!

42:40.872 --> 42:41.873
Move your furry little feet!

42:42.040 --> 42:43.625
Alvin, let's go!
Hurry, Alvin!

42:43.791 --> 42:45.585
I will pounce on you!

42:45.752 --> 42:47.003
Alvin, jump!

42:47.170 --> 42:48.338
Hurry up, Alvin, come on!

42:48.630 --> 42:49.714
I will...

42:51.090 --> 42:52.091
Whoopsie.

42:52.175 --> 42:53.259
...take a little nap.

42:56.304 --> 42:58.306
So, how much
is this gonna cost?

42:58.473 --> 43:00.683
To the nearest
bus station, $32.

43:00.850 --> 43:02.810
we're a little short.

43:02.977 --> 43:04.062
How short?

43:04.228 --> 43:05.313
About 32 bucks.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.487
Have a nice night.

43:14.072 --> 43:15.365
Easy for you to say.

43:15.531 --> 43:17.867
You're not the one
who has to sleep outside!

43:18.034 --> 43:20.453
Thanks for nothing!
Drive safely!

43:21.371 --> 43:22.372
What?

43:22.455 --> 43:24.457
I hope he gets home safe.

43:26.209 --> 43:27.210
Ouch!

43:27.335 --> 43:30.254
I got
a splinter in my tail.

43:35.510 --> 43:37.762
I can't sleep
without my pillow.

43:39.222 --> 43:40.264
I don't suppose they make

43:40.348 --> 43:42.684
Tempur-Pedic tree branches,
do they?

43:43.017 --> 43:45.103
Seriously, guys?

43:45.269 --> 43:46.312
You're the ones who
are supposed to be

43:46.396 --> 43:48.147
comfortable sleeping in trees,
not me.

43:48.314 --> 43:50.024
We're not talking to you,
okay?

43:50.191 --> 43:52.110
Not after you tried
to leave me behind!

43:52.276 --> 43:53.861
First, awesome, because

43:53.945 --> 43:55.822
I don't wanna
talk to you either.

43:55.988 --> 43:59.158
And second, you guys would've
done the same thing to me.

43:59.325 --> 44:02.745
No, Miles, we actually
would have waited for you.

44:02.912 --> 44:04.706
Yeah, we're in this together.

44:04.872 --> 44:07.750
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

44:07.917 --> 44:09.460
I've heard your lame
family motto, man.

44:09.627 --> 44:10.628
It's a bunch of crap.

44:10.795 --> 44:12.630
People look out
for themselves.

44:12.797 --> 44:14.507
It's biology,
it's what animals do.

44:14.674 --> 44:17.260
Well, on behalf of
animals everywhere...

44:17.427 --> 44:19.220
I find your
attitude insulting.

44:19.387 --> 44:21.597
Call it whatever you want,
man. It's true.

44:22.390 --> 44:23.516
What, you think my dad was

44:23.599 --> 44:24.809
thinking about anyone
other than himself...

44:24.976 --> 44:26.310
when he left me and my mom?

44:26.477 --> 44:27.520
But, I...

44:27.979 --> 44:30.064
I thought you said
your dad was...

44:35.403 --> 44:36.654
Right, um...

44:38.990 --> 44:41.576
He might as well have.
He left when I was only five.

44:42.368 --> 44:43.703
Sorry, Miles.

44:43.786 --> 44:44.787
Whatever.

44:45.913 --> 44:47.457
I don't care, you know?

44:48.958 --> 44:50.793
I've done just fine
without him.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.253
Miles, listen.

44:52.420 --> 44:54.964
If Dave and your mom
end up together...

44:55.131 --> 44:56.799
he's a good person.

44:56.966 --> 44:58.718
He would never bail on you.

44:59.927 --> 45:01.763
Then why are you
making this trip?

45:04.557 --> 45:05.558
Right.

45:06.642 --> 45:08.770
Because you think
he's gonna ditch you, too.

45:12.356 --> 45:14.192
Look, dads are overrated.

45:15.818 --> 45:18.362
Eventually, you will
get over him leaving.

45:20.031 --> 45:21.073
Really?

45:23.618 --> 45:24.619
Yeah.

46:04.826 --> 46:06.577
I can't...

46:06.744 --> 46:08.955
I'm too tired.

46:09.330 --> 46:10.331
Dude!

46:11.415 --> 46:12.750
Are you joking?

46:14.502 --> 46:16.003
I can still see the tree!

46:19.799 --> 46:21.300
Come on, it's 10 miles
to the bus station.

46:21.384 --> 46:22.760
Can't you go any faster?

46:22.885 --> 46:24.470
Um, not to split hairs,

46:24.554 --> 46:27.265
but given that our legs
are 90% shorter than yours...

46:28.474 --> 46:32.520
...we're technically walking
384% faster than you are.

46:32.687 --> 46:34.146
Nerd alert!

46:34.355 --> 46:35.982
Um...

46:39.110 --> 46:40.278
Fine.

46:40.444 --> 46:41.487
Come on up.

46:41.696 --> 46:42.947
Really?

46:43.114 --> 46:44.240
Changing my mind in three...

46:44.407 --> 46:45.658
All right!
Yes!

46:45.825 --> 46:46.826
Two...

46:47.076 --> 46:48.077
<i>ODE.</i>

46:48.160 --> 46:49.412
Come on, come on!
Whoo-hoo!

46:50.872 --> 46:51.873
Thank you.

46:51.956 --> 46:52.957
Sweet!

46:53.040 --> 46:56.210
Now this is quite
an efficient way to travel.

46:56.377 --> 46:58.588
Yeah. I could go for miles
on Miles.

46:58.930 --> 47:00.348
My God, that's so bad.

47:00.514 --> 47:01.974
Then why are you laughing?

47:02.141 --> 47:03.434
Because that was so bad.

47:03.601 --> 47:05.686
I think thatjoke
missed by miles.

48:04.829 --> 48:06.747
Yeah, this is where I
dropped them, all right.

48:06.914 --> 48:08.708
Look how obvious
these tracks are.

48:10.876 --> 48:12.003
Amateurs.

48:21.095 --> 48:23.055
<i>s' Hey HOW! Hey now!
4“ Hey now!</i>

48:33.441 --> 48:35.568
Only 863 miles to go.

48:42.616 --> 48:44.452
Did some chipmunks
jump on your bus?

48:44.618 --> 48:47.163
Um-They bought a ticket
to New Orleans.

48:49.123 --> 48:50.750
You know
that's not normal, right?

49:01.390 --> 49:02.766
All right! Nice!

49:05.686 --> 49:07.604
All right! A tater tot!

49:07.771 --> 49:10.357
Looks like our luck is finally
turning around.

49:10.524 --> 49:11.775
It's not.

49:12.443 --> 49:13.819
No! Suggs?

49:14.028 --> 49:15.195
Hello, boys.

49:15.362 --> 49:16.530
How did you find us?

49:18.949 --> 49:20.951
I'm an air marshal!

49:21.118 --> 49:23.203
Law enforcement's my life.

49:23.704 --> 49:26.165
Now, we can either do this
the easy way...

49:26.540 --> 49:27.916
or the hard way.

49:28.292 --> 49:30.878
My brothers and I would like
to discuss our options.

49:31.420 --> 49:32.880
You only got one option.

49:33.047 --> 49:34.340
Chipmunkjail.

49:34.506 --> 49:36.008
With tiny little bars,

49:36.091 --> 49:38.177
and a tiny little barbed wire
fence, and a tiny toilet...

49:38.344 --> 49:41.513
and a tiny yard where you can
lift your tiny little weights!

49:41.847 --> 49:43.349
It sounds adorable.

49:43.891 --> 49:44.892
Hey!

49:44.975 --> 49:46.518
Guys, slingshot. On three.

49:46.894 --> 49:48.771
One, two, three!
Now, I don't have all night.

49:49.605 --> 49:50.773
Nuts.

49:50.939 --> 49:52.274
We chose the hard way.

49:53.734 --> 49:54.985
Hope you're okay.

49:56.403 --> 49:57.654
- He's coming!
- Watch out, gangway!

49:57.738 --> 49:58.822
Hurry, Theodore, run!

49:58.906 --> 50:00.449
Let's go! Come on, hurry up!
Excuse us!

50:00.532 --> 50:02.201
Come on, Alvin! He's coming!
Go, Miles, go!

50:02.284 --> 50:03.827
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
In here! Come on!

50:07.289 --> 50:08.957
Whoo, I think we lost him.
Hey!

50:09.041 --> 50:10.042
Disregard.

50:10.125 --> 50:11.126
Come back here!

50:13.799 --> 50:14.841
Excuse me, pardon me.

50:14.925 --> 50:16.134
There's a crazy guy
chasing us!

50:20.138 --> 50:23.225
You look tired, baby.
Here you go.

50:23.391 --> 50:24.392
Thank you so much.

50:27.103 --> 50:28.104
Nice one, Suggsy!

50:28.271 --> 50:29.439
That tastes like fire!

50:29.856 --> 50:30.899
It's moonshine.

50:30.982 --> 50:32.275
Fire, please put it out!

50:32.442 --> 50:33.652
Wash it down with this, here.

50:34.945 --> 50:35.987
Um, ooh...

50:36.071 --> 50:37.113
That's butterscotch.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.323
Butterscotch liquor.

50:38.406 --> 50:39.783
Ooh!

50:40.033 --> 50:41.451
And moonshine!

50:42.911 --> 50:43.912
Hi, Suggs!

50:43.995 --> 50:45.622
Yes!

50:47.332 --> 50:48.875
Thank you, Mr. Trombone.

50:49.042 --> 50:51.044
This calls for a celebration!

50:52.170 --> 50:54.214
Hello, New Orleans!

50:54.714 --> 50:57.217
Direct from our Austin
to Miami Comeback Tour,

50:57.300 --> 50:59.553
we're The Chipmunks!

51:01.137 --> 51:03.640
ls everybody ready
to get their funk on?

51:25.829 --> 51:26.830
Okay.

51:59.070 --> 52:00.322
<i>4' Hey!</i>

52:18.006 --> 52:19.132
What's happening?
What's happening?

52:48.370 --> 52:50.330
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>

52:59.130 --> 53:00.507
This whole day
has been incredible.

53:00.674 --> 53:01.967
It's been the perfect day.

53:02.133 --> 53:03.760
<i>Coming up,
The Chipmunks are back.</i>

53:03.843 --> 53:04.970
What?

53:05.053 --> 53:06.221
<i>You heard me.
Alvin, Simon and Theodore...</i>

53:06.304 --> 53:07.347
Excuse me, could you
turn that up, please?

53:07.430 --> 53:08.431
Yeah, sure.

53:08.515 --> 53:09.516
<i>...are making some noise
in the Big Easy...</i>

53:09.599 --> 53:11.309
<i>When I say "Party,"
you say "Alvin!"</i>

53:11.393 --> 53:13.061
<i>Party!</i>
Alvin!

53:13.144 --> 53:14.145
No.

53:14.229 --> 53:15.480
<i>Party!
Alvin!</i>

53:15.647 --> 53:16.690
<i>Party!</i>

53:17.149 --> 53:20.110
<i>Alvin!</i>

53:20.194 --> 53:22.571
<i>Alvin!</i>

53:25.783 --> 53:27.076
Did you guys hear that?

53:27.159 --> 53:28.160
Hear what?

53:28.452 --> 53:29.828
Never mind.

53:29.995 --> 53:32.540
Guys, last night was one
of the best nights of my life.

53:32.706 --> 53:34.416
It was pretty crazy.

53:34.583 --> 53:36.335
Even that Suggs guy
hung out with us.

53:36.502 --> 53:38.295
Yeah, he's not
that bad after all.

53:38.462 --> 53:40.089
Hey, we missed
a call from Dave.

53:40.923 --> 53:42.049
And a text.

53:42.550 --> 53:43.968
27 of them.

53:45.302 --> 53:46.303
No.

53:51.433 --> 53:52.643
Where am I?

53:53.602 --> 53:54.728
What is this?

53:58.566 --> 53:59.858
Suggs!
Who are you?

54:00.025 --> 54:02.695
It's Vitto,
the band's manager, remember?

54:02.861 --> 54:04.905
The only thing I remember

54:04.989 --> 54:08.200
is being attacked
by a trombone.

54:08.367 --> 54:09.451
Right, yeah.

54:09.618 --> 54:11.328
You got that crazy bump
on your head.

54:11.495 --> 54:12.663
You didn't care, though.

54:12.830 --> 54:14.832
You just wanted to party!

54:15.040 --> 54:18.043
We hit every jazz club
in the Quarter.

54:20.045 --> 54:21.463
What do you mean, "We"?

54:21.630 --> 54:25.092
You, me, and those
dope chipmunk dudes!

54:28.554 --> 54:32.933
I partied with
those tree-skunks?

54:33.225 --> 54:35.978
They're the ones who dared you
to get that sassy tattoo!

54:37.104 --> 54:39.523
What? What?

54:43.986 --> 54:45.821
How could I have let them
talk me into this?

54:46.113 --> 54:48.032
No.
You asked for that one.

54:48.115 --> 54:50.242
The other one was their idea.

54:52.911 --> 54:54.580
What "other one"?

54:56.707 --> 54:57.708
What?

55:09.637 --> 55:11.972
This is where they told us
to meet them, right?

55:12.139 --> 55:14.475
Well, yelled at us
to meet them.

55:14.642 --> 55:16.352
Hopefully they had time to
cool off on the plane.

55:16.769 --> 55:17.811
There you are.

55:17.895 --> 55:18.854
Dave!
Dave!

55:18.937 --> 55:20.439
Mom!
Don't "Dave, Mom" us.

55:20.522 --> 55:21.523
You know what, Dave?

55:21.607 --> 55:23.108
You're an artist,
and you're emotional...

55:23.233 --> 55:24.693
and you follow your heart,
but maybe

55:24.777 --> 55:26.195
I should take
the lead on this one.

55:26.362 --> 55:27.404
You know,
we keep a level head.

55:27.488 --> 55:28.864
Throw them a little Good Cop.

55:29.031 --> 55:30.658
Okay-
Okay-

55:31.700 --> 55:32.868
Don't you "Dave, Mom" us.

55:33.035 --> 55:35.412
Do you have any idea
how terrifying it is...

55:35.579 --> 55:37.122
to find out that your children
are 2,000 miles

55:37.206 --> 55:38.499
away from where
they're supposed to be?

55:38.666 --> 55:40.084
You are lucky that
there are witnesses,

55:40.167 --> 55:41.710
because I am
so mad right now...

55:41.877 --> 55:43.295
that I could just spit!
Okay, okay.

55:43.462 --> 55:44.672
Right here, on this floor!

55:44.838 --> 55:47.383
Okay, okay. Nice Good Cop.

55:47.549 --> 55:50.427
Dave, I swear, it wasn't as
crazy as it looked on TV.

55:50.594 --> 55:51.637
Really?

55:51.804 --> 55:52.971
Well, let me just
pull up some of

55:53.055 --> 55:54.765
Theodore's tweets
from last night.

55:55.474 --> 55:57.142
"Only one word
to describe this night,

55:57.226 --> 55:59.269
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy."

55:59.436 --> 56:00.896
Or, "if you wanna get crazy,

56:00.979 --> 56:02.481
"go to New Orleans.
It's the craziest."

56:02.648 --> 56:04.692
Or, "In a New Orleans
Jazz Parade,

56:04.775 --> 56:05.901
"so crazy."

56:06.068 --> 56:07.111
We're really sorry, Dave.

56:07.277 --> 56:08.946
Sorry's not gonna
cut it this time, guys.

56:09.113 --> 56:11.031
If it were up to me,
we'd be going home,

56:11.115 --> 56:12.700
but I gotta get back to Miami.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.494
Do not smile.
You guys are grounded in Miami

56:15.577 --> 56:16.745
and also when
we get back to LA.

56:17.204 --> 56:18.831
When are we
not grounded?

56:18.956 --> 56:20.874
You'll be so old,
your fur will be gray.

56:21.041 --> 56:22.334
Yeah, that goes for
your fur too, Miles.

56:22.418 --> 56:23.627
I don't have fur.

56:23.711 --> 56:24.795
Well, whatever you have
is grounded...

56:24.878 --> 56:26.338
for a long time. Let's go.

56:27.464 --> 56:29.216
They didn't
kill us after all.

56:29.299 --> 56:30.467
Feels like a win.

56:30.551 --> 56:33.303
Hey, guys, Operation
"No Proposal" is still on.

56:33.470 --> 56:34.930
Yeah!
All right!

56:36.056 --> 56:37.141
High... Fist.

56:37.307 --> 56:39.101
Give me some.

56:39.226 --> 56:40.227
Sorry.
Take it easy!

56:40.310 --> 56:41.437
- Guys, come on.
- Jeez.

56:41.520 --> 56:42.521
Yeah.

56:44.231 --> 56:45.357
Here you go.
Thank you.

56:45.524 --> 56:47.067
You're welcome.
And may I see your ID, please?

56:47.234 --> 56:48.235
Yes.

56:49.111 --> 56:50.362
Thank you.

56:50.529 --> 56:51.655
Hey, um...

56:51.822 --> 56:53.449
Are you sure about this?

56:53.615 --> 56:55.534
Because if this
three-ring circus

56:55.617 --> 56:57.286
is too scary for you,
I totally get it...

56:57.453 --> 56:59.288
and we could just
go back to LA.

56:59.455 --> 57:00.998
I mean, you wouldn't be
the first guy

57:01.081 --> 57:03.584
to head for the hills once
we showed our crazy cards.

57:03.751 --> 57:05.586
Please, your circus
only has one ring.

57:05.669 --> 57:07.171
Stop looking at me.

57:07.254 --> 57:08.297
Mine's
the three-ringer.

57:08.380 --> 57:09.423
You're the one
who should think

57:09.506 --> 57:10.591
about heading for the hills.

57:11.383 --> 57:12.968
I'm not going anywhere.

57:13.135 --> 57:14.553
Except to get us a coffee.

57:15.304 --> 57:16.430
I'll meet you at the gate.

57:17.514 --> 57:18.515
Sir?

57:19.057 --> 57:20.267
Is there a problem?

57:20.350 --> 57:21.643
Problem? What problem?

57:21.810 --> 57:23.061
There sure is.

57:25.272 --> 57:26.648
Man.
Right.

57:26.815 --> 57:28.066
Whoopsies.
That.

57:28.233 --> 57:29.234
Guys.

57:29.318 --> 57:30.611
Nuts.

57:35.699 --> 57:38.452
Seriously, guys,
the No-Fly List? Come on!

57:38.619 --> 57:40.412
At least we're not
on the No-Drive List.

57:40.579 --> 57:42.790
There's no such thing
as a No-Drive List, Theodore.

57:42.956 --> 57:44.875
I'm sure you guys will
find a way to start one.

57:45.042 --> 57:46.794
Let's not overreact, Dave.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.170
The only reason we left home
in the first place...

57:48.253 --> 57:50.255
Guys, not now, okay?

57:51.632 --> 57:52.966
I worked my butt off

57:53.050 --> 57:55.219
on Ashley's album,
and because of you three...

57:55.385 --> 57:57.513
I might not even get to
the record release!

57:57.805 --> 58:00.557
Not to mention, you've ruined
this trip for me and Samantha.

58:00.724 --> 58:03.143
It's just, when you took
Samantha to Miami...

58:03.227 --> 58:04.728
Theodore, I'm not
in the mood to hear it.

58:04.895 --> 58:06.063
But Dave, we don't...

58:06.146 --> 58:08.440
Alvin, don't.
You'll just make it worse.

58:11.568 --> 58:13.362
Thank you for nothing.

58:15.030 --> 58:16.198
Agent Suggs, Air Marshal.

58:16.281 --> 58:17.324
I'll be with you
in a moment, sir.

58:17.407 --> 58:19.201
Okay, you're gonna
regret that.

58:31.547 --> 58:34.299
Did you help three chipmunks
get their rental car today?

58:34.466 --> 58:35.759
Yeah, they came in.

58:35.926 --> 58:37.761
With some guy,
probably their dad.

58:38.053 --> 58:39.847
Probably not their dad,
because he's a human...

58:40.013 --> 58:41.682
and they're chipmunks!
Hey!

58:42.766 --> 58:44.601
Families come in all
shapes and sizes, sir.

58:44.852 --> 58:45.853
It's not for me to judge.

58:45.936 --> 58:47.229
We don't do that here,
at Miss Bee's.

58:47.396 --> 58:49.106
Okay, this is how
it's gonna go down...

58:49.273 --> 58:50.607
I need you to go back there,

58:50.691 --> 58:53.443
and get me the GPS information
for that rental car.

58:53.944 --> 58:56.029
We don't track
our rental cars, sir.

58:56.196 --> 58:57.698
Is that so?

58:58.574 --> 59:00.909
I work for the United States
government...

59:01.076 --> 59:03.161
and we pretty much
track everything.

59:03.328 --> 59:04.872
I know what you had
for lunch today.

59:05.789 --> 59:06.790
Falafel!

59:07.249 --> 59:08.333
Now scurry back there,

59:08.417 --> 59:09.835
and get me the frequency

59:09.918 --> 59:11.837
and uplink code
from that rental car.

59:12.796 --> 59:13.797
Hey!

59:14.047 --> 59:17.467
And I need the fastest set
of wheels you've got!

59:24.016 --> 59:26.018
Are you kidding me right now?

59:26.393 --> 59:27.561
Do you know what this is?

59:27.728 --> 59:29.855
This is a roller skate
with wheels.

59:30.022 --> 59:31.607
Pretty sure roller skates
come with wheels.

59:36.278 --> 59:38.071
It's like Tweety Bird!

59:38.989 --> 59:39.990
Buckle up!

59:40.157 --> 59:41.158
Shut up!

59:41.909 --> 59:44.119
This is like driving
a parakeet!

59:49.958 --> 59:52.753
Those rodents got
a 200-mile head start.

59:53.587 --> 59:56.506
Time to roll up
some road, Suggs.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.941
Come on!

01:00:14.524 --> 01:00:17.110
Fly, Bee! Fly!

01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:19.071
- Are we there yet?
- No.

01:00:19.196 --> 01:00:20.405
Are we there yet?
No.

01:00:20.572 --> 01:00:22.032
Are we there yet?
No.

01:00:23.575 --> 01:00:25.118
- All right!
- Awesome!

01:00:25.243 --> 01:00:26.912
Remember, guys, we're here
to make a quick pit stop...

01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:28.413
then we're getting
back on the road.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.082
Don't worry, Dave,
it'll be really quick.

01:00:30.248 --> 01:00:31.917
Yeah, super quick.

01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:34.086
Umm-

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.630
Thanks, Dave. I just needed

01:00:36.755 --> 01:00:39.341
a little snack to get me
from lunch to dinner.

01:00:39.508 --> 01:00:40.926
That's unusual.

01:00:41.093 --> 01:00:42.260
Don't be mad, Dave.

01:00:42.427 --> 01:00:44.179
It would have been rude
to not order something.

01:00:44.346 --> 01:00:47.474
Hey, guys! Look what I won!
Isn't he cute?

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.434
Look at that face!

01:00:49.601 --> 01:00:50.852
That's actually funny, Alvin.

01:01:04.616 --> 01:01:06.326
Whoa!
All right!

01:01:09.454 --> 01:01:10.956
Now we're talking.

01:01:11.123 --> 01:01:12.290
WOW.

01:01:14.459 --> 01:01:16.795
Holy guacamole!

01:01:16.962 --> 01:01:18.296
I could live here.

01:01:18.547 --> 01:01:19.548
Hey, no smiling.

01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:21.216
You're still grounded,
remember?

01:01:21.842 --> 01:01:23.719
Thanks.
Thank you.

01:01:23.885 --> 01:01:25.679
This is what
I'm talking about.

01:01:25.887 --> 01:01:26.888
Hi.

01:01:26.972 --> 01:01:29.141
Wow! <i>Hola!</i>

01:01:30.308 --> 01:01:31.643
on, baby.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.061
If this is grounded...

01:01:33.228 --> 01:01:34.396
ground me for life.

01:01:34.563 --> 01:01:35.647
Don't tempt me.

01:01:37.399 --> 01:01:38.442
Hey, Dave!

01:01:38.525 --> 01:01:40.027
We'd like to do
the mature thing...

01:01:40.193 --> 01:01:41.945
and accept
partial responsibility

01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:43.530
for all the trouble
we've caused.

01:01:43.697 --> 01:01:44.698
Partial?
Yeah.

01:01:44.865 --> 01:01:46.116
60-40, on us.

01:01:47.075 --> 01:01:48.493
70-30?

01:01:48.869 --> 01:01:50.787
As much as I hate the idea of
letting you three

01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:52.706
out of my sight
for even a second...

01:01:52.873 --> 01:01:55.834
Samantha and I have dinner
plans that I can't get out of.

01:01:56.001 --> 01:01:57.753
So if anything happens,
we'll be at the villa.

01:01:57.919 --> 01:01:59.337
Ooh, romantic.

01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:01.048
What?

01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:03.508
Hi.
Hi.

01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:05.719
All right, you are
not to leave this room.

01:02:05.886 --> 01:02:07.387
Do you understand, young man?
Yeah.

01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:09.347
You guys don't
have to worry about us.

01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:11.767
We'll be on our
best behavior tonight.

01:02:11.933 --> 01:02:13.268
I promise. Whoa.

01:02:13.435 --> 01:02:14.603
I know you will,
because I hired

01:02:14.686 --> 01:02:16.063
a babysitter to keep
an eye on you.

01:02:16.229 --> 01:02:17.355
What? Come on.
Man.

01:02:17.522 --> 01:02:18.940
We'll be home after the party.

01:02:22.944 --> 01:02:24.362
Almost forgot this.

01:02:31.536 --> 01:02:32.913
Dave is going
to propose tonight.

01:02:33.038 --> 01:02:34.206
What gave that away?

01:02:34.372 --> 01:02:35.874
The romantic dinner
or the engagement ring?

01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.626
Alvin, what are we
going to do?

01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:39.377
Absolutely nothing.

01:02:39.544 --> 01:02:40.962
What?
Alvin's right.

01:02:41.129 --> 01:02:43.256
This hasn't been so bad.

01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:46.051
Maybe we just...

01:02:46.718 --> 01:02:47.886
do nothing.
"Nothing"?

01:02:48.053 --> 01:02:51.223
Guys, "nothing" isn't a plan!
We can't do "nothing."

01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.557
Sure we can.

01:02:52.724 --> 01:02:54.893
Good luck proposing
without this.

01:02:54.976 --> 01:02:57.229
Alvin!
When did you grab it?

01:02:57.395 --> 01:02:59.648
I found it in his bag,
five minutes ago.

01:02:59.898 --> 01:03:01.733
Does that mean we did it?

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.901
We did it.

01:03:03.401 --> 01:03:04.361
Huzzah!

01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:13.078
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

01:03:13.495 --> 01:03:15.747
We did it! Wh00-h00!

01:03:22.838 --> 01:03:25.674
Come on, Miles,
join the party?

01:03:27.342 --> 01:03:28.426
Miles?

01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:33.807
Miles, wait up!
Come on, man.

01:03:33.974 --> 01:03:35.016
Let's celebrate! We did it!

01:03:35.183 --> 01:03:36.268
Yeah.

01:03:36.434 --> 01:03:37.477
You guys ruined
Dave's proposal

01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:38.603
and now we
don't have to hang out.

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:39.938
Miles, hold on.

01:03:40.105 --> 01:03:41.481
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

01:03:41.648 --> 01:03:42.649
Yeah, man.

01:03:42.816 --> 01:03:44.442
I thought we had a great time
in New Orleans.

01:03:44.609 --> 01:03:45.944
So did I. And then
I saw you celebrating

01:03:46.027 --> 01:03:47.070
like you won the Super Bowl...

01:03:47.154 --> 01:03:49.072
the second you found out
we weren't gonna be family.

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:50.365
So... see you.

01:03:50.782 --> 01:03:52.826
Miles, wait! I can explain!

01:03:52.993 --> 01:03:54.828
Guys, come on. Miles...

01:03:55.287 --> 01:03:57.247
We've been through
a lot together.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:58.665
Don't walk away now.

01:03:58.832 --> 01:03:59.875
Yeah. Come on, Miles.

01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:03.712
Miles?

01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:05.630
Miles? Miles!

01:04:05.964 --> 01:04:07.465
Watch out!

01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:08.884
Alvin, he can't hear us!

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.343
I'll knock him out of the way!

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.012
Slingshot on three!
Let's do this.

01:04:12.095 --> 01:04:13.054
One...

01:04:13.138 --> 01:04:14.139
two...

01:04:14.222 --> 01:04:15.223
three!

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:16.683
Whoa!

01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:28.236
Theo.
Theodore!

01:04:31.907 --> 01:04:33.158
Theo.
Theodore.

01:04:33.325 --> 01:04:35.076
Is he okay?
I don't know.

01:04:35.243 --> 01:04:38.872
Theo! Come on! Get up! Please!

01:04:44.377 --> 01:04:45.837
No! Theodore!

01:04:46.004 --> 01:04:47.005
Come on!

01:04:47.172 --> 01:04:48.173
Say something, say something!

01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:51.509
I smell...

01:04:52.385 --> 01:04:53.428
empanadas?

01:04:53.511 --> 01:04:54.512
Theo!

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.181
Theo, you're alive!

01:04:56.514 --> 01:04:57.557
Is this Heaven?

01:04:57.724 --> 01:04:58.850
No, it's South Beach.

01:05:00.018 --> 01:05:02.062
Theodore, you saved my life.

01:05:02.187 --> 01:05:05.190
Like we always say,
you mess with one of us...

01:05:05.774 --> 01:05:07.734
Don't make me say it, man,
it's so lame.

01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:09.945
Miles, he got hit
by a car for you.

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.322
You mess with all of us.
All right!

01:05:12.405 --> 01:05:14.574
Whoo-hoo! Ouch!

01:05:14.699 --> 01:05:17.118
Miles, we are so sorry.

01:05:17.285 --> 01:05:20.121
We haven't been fair to you
from day one.

01:05:20.288 --> 01:05:21.581
And the truth is...

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:25.252
you'd make a great brother.

01:05:25.377 --> 01:05:26.378
Yeah!

01:05:27.087 --> 01:05:28.964
I feel the same
about you guys.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:31.466
So, I guess we're going to be
family after all.

01:05:31.633 --> 01:05:33.802
Except for one tiny detail...

01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:35.053
By stealing the ring,

01:05:35.136 --> 01:05:37.222
we've effectively
ruined the proposal.

01:05:37.389 --> 01:05:38.390
You're right.

01:05:38.473 --> 01:05:41.726
We need to get that ring,
and get to that restaurant!

01:05:41.893 --> 01:05:43.395
Let's do it. Come on.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.318
Looks like Air Marshal Suggs

01:05:50.402 --> 01:05:53.238
is gonna be checking into
the Shelborne Hotel.

01:05:53.571 --> 01:05:54.572
Yes!

01:05:54.739 --> 01:05:56.658
Time for a chip hunt!

01:05:57.075 --> 01:05:58.410
I really
wanna go with you...

01:05:58.743 --> 01:05:59.786
but I'm stuck babysitting.

01:05:59.953 --> 01:06:00.996
Aw, man. The babysitter.

01:06:01.162 --> 01:06:03.248
I hope when they get here,
they're not annoying.

01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:05.083
Let's go.
Like, this last time...

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.294
I had a kid,
and he was, like...

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.421
"My gosh, can I have
yogurt?" And I was like...

01:06:09.587 --> 01:06:11.047
"My gosh,
can you go to sleep?"

01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:12.173
I don't think
she knows we're here.

01:06:12.257 --> 01:06:13.341
I was like, "Ridiculous."

01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:14.801
I don't think
she knows she's here.

01:06:14.926 --> 01:06:17.470
This really sucks,
when you're so responsible,

01:06:17.595 --> 01:06:19.639
and, like, everyone
around you is so not.

01:06:19.806 --> 01:06:21.933
You know what I mean?
It's like, it's hard.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.601
There you are.

01:06:23.768 --> 01:06:25.020
Well, okay, I'm totally
texting you right now.

01:06:25.186 --> 01:06:26.688
Hold on, let me
send you this picture.

01:06:27.856 --> 01:06:29.858
He's, like, super cute.
I really like him.

01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:31.776
Come on! Let's go.
Aw, I know.

01:06:31.943 --> 01:06:33.945
What are you talking about?
I like that he's hairy.

01:06:34.112 --> 01:06:35.613
Hairy, you say?

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.948
Yeah, scruffy's, like, cute.

01:06:37.449 --> 01:06:41.161
It's like, "Hi, lam adorable,
but I'm also an animal."

01:06:41.786 --> 01:06:43.121
You know? Yeah, I know.

01:06:43.288 --> 01:06:45.123
Yeah, right. Miles!
We're on our way.

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:46.458
Yeah, I know he's
a little short, but

01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:48.043
I don't know, you know
that famous saying...

01:06:48.126 --> 01:06:49.461
Theo! Come on! Let's go!

01:06:49.544 --> 01:06:50.879
"Little things come in big
packages," or whatever.

01:06:50.962 --> 01:06:52.047
Man.
It's like that.

01:06:52.964 --> 01:06:54.132
I think
she liked me.

01:06:54.507 --> 01:06:55.675
I, like, could be
doing so many more

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.135
important things right now.

01:06:57.302 --> 01:06:59.554
I could be, I don't know,
getting a pedicure?

01:07:00.638 --> 01:07:03.224
I'm looking for
some chipmunks.

01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:07.645
Guys, their reservation
was at 8:00.

01:07:07.812 --> 01:07:10.315
So, we still might have time
to save the proposal.

01:07:10.648 --> 01:07:12.275
Come on, let's go. Go!

01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:13.360
Listen to me,

01:07:13.485 --> 01:07:14.444
I know these chipmunks
are here.

01:07:14.527 --> 01:07:16.029
This is a badge for the United
States government, okay?

01:07:16.112 --> 01:07:17.072
Okay, guys,
here's the plan...

01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:18.823
- So, I need for you...
- No. It's Suggs!

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.241
He found us.

01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:22.243
Theodore, get up!

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.412
Miles, you gotta get
the ring to Dave!

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:25.705
I'm not leaving you guys.

01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:27.415
We'll distract him. Just go!

01:07:27.582 --> 01:07:28.583
Run, run!

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:29.876
Theo! Hurry!
Get back here!

01:07:30.043 --> 01:07:31.711
I'm going
as fast as I can!

01:07:31.878 --> 01:07:33.505
Think of donuts,
think of donuts!

01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:35.507
Donuts? Whoo-hoo!

01:07:35.882 --> 01:07:36.925
Go, Miles, go!
Hurry!

01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.259
Run, run!

01:07:38.426 --> 01:07:39.594
Hide over here!
Where?

01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:41.763
I don't know!
Just think of something!

01:07:50.355 --> 01:07:52.690
Come on. Where are you?

01:07:53.233 --> 01:07:54.401
Where are you?

01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:59.572
Come on.

01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:02.117
Come on. Come on.

01:08:15.296 --> 01:08:16.923
Hi...ya.

01:08:17.256 --> 01:08:18.258
See ya!

01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:24.514
Go, go, go!

01:08:24.596 --> 01:08:25.640
Run, run!

01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:27.767
Hurry, hurry! He's coming!

01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:30.270
Hurry, Alvin. Hit the button!

01:08:30.437 --> 01:08:32.063
Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry!

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:35.649
Ha!

01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:40.654
Here's Suggsy!

01:08:40.822 --> 01:08:42.157
He's like the Terminator!
Yeah!

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:45.952
No.

01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:47.620
This is ironic.

01:08:47.912 --> 01:08:49.622
We're gonna be going up...

01:08:49.788 --> 01:08:52.125
but I'm taking you boys down.

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:55.752
Now, here's what's
gonna happen...

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:58.173
I'm gonna turn you over
to Homeland Security...

01:08:58.339 --> 01:08:59.591
and they're gonna put you
in a zoo prison

01:08:59.674 --> 01:09:00.800
for dangerous animals.

01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:01.926
No.

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:03.970
And then, if you ever
get out of there...

01:09:04.136 --> 01:09:06.139
I'm gonna pay someone to
have you stuffed.

01:09:06.264 --> 01:09:07.223
Right.

01:09:07.307 --> 01:09:09.517
And I'm gonna give you
as a gift to Anna,

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.352
who will hopefully
take me back.

01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:14.147
Dude, I'm sorry,
but it's over.

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:16.107
You don't know that.
Theo, let's go.

01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.567
I just think there's something
wrong with her phone

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:18.651
and she's not getting
my texts...

01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:20.694
or the flowers,
or my candy grams.

01:09:20.778 --> 01:09:22.447
And I, personally,
don't think it's uncommon...

01:09:22.613 --> 01:09:23.656
for someone to move
five times a year

01:09:23.781 --> 01:09:24.782
and change their number.

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:26.493
Okay? It's normal.

01:09:26.868 --> 01:09:29.287
Yeah. Totally normal.

01:09:29.453 --> 01:09:30.455
Alvin!

01:09:30.537 --> 01:09:31.581
What? What's going on?

01:09:31.663 --> 01:09:33.124
And that's our cue to leave.

01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:35.960
It has been a treat.

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:37.212
No... What are you doing?

01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:38.630
Elevator power off.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:40.840
No! No!

01:09:52.477 --> 01:09:53.478
Excuse me!

01:09:53.645 --> 01:09:54.646
Pardon me!

01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:55.730
Miles!

01:09:56.064 --> 01:09:57.899
Hey. What happened to
Officer Dingleberry?

01:09:58.066 --> 01:10:00.485
Let's just say
his elevator got stuck.

01:10:00.652 --> 01:10:01.819
Has Dave proposed yet?

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.072
No, but they're on dessert.
It can't be long.

01:10:04.239 --> 01:10:05.323
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

01:10:05.406 --> 01:10:06.658
Okay.

01:10:08.409 --> 01:10:09.410
You remember what to do?

01:10:09.577 --> 01:10:10.662
Yes, sir. Be no problem.
There's the box.

01:10:10.828 --> 01:10:12.664
It's go time.
Excuse me...

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:14.499
young man, we have a strict

01:10:14.582 --> 01:10:16.501
no pets policy
at this restaurant.

01:10:16.668 --> 01:10:18.920
I'm going to have to ask you
to take your meerkats home.

01:10:19.087 --> 01:10:20.088
Meerkats!

01:10:20.171 --> 01:10:21.172
Esteban.

01:10:21.256 --> 01:10:23.925
Please escort these things
out of the restaurant.

01:10:24.008 --> 01:10:25.385
All right, all right.

01:10:25.552 --> 01:10:28.096
Come on, guys.
We know when we're not wanted.

01:10:28.263 --> 01:10:30.181
Evasive maneuvers! Nutmeg!

01:10:30.515 --> 01:10:31.808
He shoots, he scores!
Nice, Alvin!

01:10:31.891 --> 01:10:33.142
Go, Alvin, go!

01:10:33.226 --> 01:10:35.436
Did you hear that? It sounded
like somebody yelled "Alvin."

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.521
Alley-COP!

01:10:37.772 --> 01:10:38.773
Whoo-hoo!

01:10:39.232 --> 01:10:40.275
Pardon me!

01:10:40.358 --> 01:10:41.401
I think you're imagining it.

01:10:41.568 --> 01:10:42.819
- Alvin!
- I'm open!

01:10:42.902 --> 01:10:43.945
Or not.

01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:00.295
Gotcha!

01:11:00.587 --> 01:11:01.921
Whoo-hoo! Cold!

01:11:02.046 --> 01:11:03.715
Whoa!

01:11:04.882 --> 01:11:05.883
Alvin?

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:07.885
Hi there, Dave.

01:11:08.928 --> 01:11:11.306
Don't say it. Resist the urge.

01:11:11.472 --> 01:11:13.725
We all know you wanna say it,
but hear me out.

01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:15.268
Miles? What?

01:11:15.393 --> 01:11:16.394
We can explain everything.

01:11:16.477 --> 01:11:17.937
Well, I can't wait
to hear this.

01:11:18.563 --> 01:11:19.606
Dave, we came to Miami

01:11:19.731 --> 01:11:21.149
to stop you two
from getting engaged.

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:25.153
No.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.822
I just blew the surprise.

01:11:27.989 --> 01:11:30.575
But, and this is the part that
I'd like you to focus on...

01:11:31.284 --> 01:11:33.161
when Theodore
got hit by a car...

01:11:33.328 --> 01:11:34.746
Theodore got hit by a car?

01:11:34.912 --> 01:11:35.913
I did.

01:11:35.997 --> 01:11:38.458
He's fine. He was
saving Miles' life.

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:39.667
Wait, he what?

01:11:40.126 --> 01:11:42.503
The point is,
we realized that...

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:45.006
we like the idea of
you two being together,

01:11:45.089 --> 01:11:46.674
and we changed our minds.

01:11:46.758 --> 01:11:47.759
Yep.

01:11:48.426 --> 01:11:49.969
It might not be
the family in the photo

01:11:50.094 --> 01:11:51.471
that comes with the frame...

01:11:51.638 --> 01:11:55.099
but it's gonna be our family.
And we're proud of it.

01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:57.935
Guys, that ring isn't mine.

01:11:58.102 --> 01:12:01.147
So, you're not proposing?

01:12:02.649 --> 01:12:05.026
I'm sorry, Samantha. I'm not.

01:12:05.193 --> 01:12:06.277
Thank God.

01:12:06.819 --> 01:12:07.987
I mean,
that's not what I meant.

01:12:08.154 --> 01:12:09.280
You know. I mean, not that

01:12:09.364 --> 01:12:10.490
I couldn't see it
happening someday.

01:12:10.657 --> 01:12:12.408
I mean... Not that
I'm expecting it to happen.

01:12:12.492 --> 01:12:13.951
But I mean,
if it did happen...

01:12:14.118 --> 01:12:15.536
I'm spiraling, aren't I?

01:12:15.703 --> 01:12:17.372
A little.
What I mean is...

01:12:18.289 --> 01:12:22.043
I would love it if we could
just take our time because...

01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.379
I really want it to work.

01:12:25.338 --> 01:12:26.381
Me, too.

01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:30.134
I'm very
confused right now.

01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:32.470
You brought this ring to Miami

01:12:32.553 --> 01:12:35.306
and you said you had to
come to dinner, so...

01:12:35.473 --> 01:12:37.475
I was holding it for Barry.

01:12:37.642 --> 01:12:39.143
My sound engineer.

01:12:39.394 --> 01:12:41.229
He's proposing to
his girlfriend, Alice,

01:12:41.312 --> 01:12:42.730
at the restaurant right now...

01:12:42.897 --> 01:12:44.691
with an empty ring box.
My God.

01:12:44.857 --> 01:12:45.858
Will you marry me?

01:12:46.025 --> 01:12:48.361
It's not empty.

01:12:53.533 --> 01:12:54.659
A breath mint?

01:13:10.216 --> 01:13:11.384
Miss Grey, over here.

01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:12.593
When are you
going back on tour?

01:13:13.219 --> 01:13:15.513
The greenroom is
right this way, Mr. Seville.

01:13:17.849 --> 01:13:19.142
The only reason
we're not headed

01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:20.518
back to LA right now
is because...

01:13:20.685 --> 01:13:22.019
I have to be here.

01:13:22.186 --> 01:13:25.189
As soon as the show is over,
we're all going home.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.943
I don't think I've ever been
more disappointed

01:13:29.026 --> 01:13:30.695
in you guys
than I am right now.

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:37.660
If Dave didn't wanna
get rid of us before,

01:13:37.744 --> 01:13:39.287
he definitely does now.

01:13:39.537 --> 01:13:42.623
All because we only cared
about if we were happy.

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.042
Maybe it's a chipmunk thing,
like hoarding, you know?

01:13:45.209 --> 01:13:46.878
Maybe we're
emotional hoarders?

01:13:47.044 --> 01:13:48.337
Actually, chipmunks are

01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:50.047
traditionally
very caring creatures.

01:13:50.214 --> 01:13:53.092
Nuts.
Well, that means it's us.

01:13:53.259 --> 01:13:55.219
I'd do anything to fix this.

01:13:56.053 --> 01:13:59.223
Wait. Maybe we can fix it.

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:01.893
By doing the one thing
we do best!

01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:03.561
Cause mischief on
land, sea and air?

01:14:03.728 --> 01:14:04.896
Eat all of Dave's food?

01:14:05.062 --> 01:14:06.564
No! Music!

01:14:06.731 --> 01:14:08.566
When words aren't enough,
we sing!

01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:10.735
So let's give Dave
onelastsong

01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:13.237
to show him
how we really feel about him.

01:14:13.404 --> 01:14:15.615
Miles, start working on
that little country riff

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.824
you were doing in Texas.

01:14:16.908 --> 01:14:18.659
Where are you going?
There's so much to do.

01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:20.161
I need to talk to Wardrobe,
we need to...

01:14:20.328 --> 01:14:21.788
If we are gonna
bring down the house,

01:14:21.913 --> 01:14:23.664
we're gonna need some backup.

01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:32.131
Boy.

01:14:34.467 --> 01:14:35.760
Okay.

01:14:43.351 --> 01:14:44.352
Ooh!

01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:49.774
Um, well...

01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:51.192
You're going to Hollywood!

01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:53.110
Alvin!

01:14:53.486 --> 01:14:55.780
I'm going to Hollywood!
I'm going to Hollywood!

01:14:55.947 --> 01:14:57.990
Sorry, girls, I've always
wanted to say that.

01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.951
What are you doing here?
Yeah.

01:15:00.284 --> 01:15:02.161
We're kind of in
the middle of auditions.

01:15:02.328 --> 01:15:03.454
I need your help.

01:15:03.621 --> 01:15:06.874
We really screwed up with Dave
and we gotta fix it.

01:15:08.459 --> 01:15:10.670
Because it's for Dave,
we're in.

01:15:11.295 --> 01:15:12.797
<i>Please
give a warm welcome...</i>

01:15:12.964 --> 01:15:14.799
<i>for Miss Ashley Grey!</i>

01:15:21.848 --> 01:15:23.057
<i>Thank you, GUYS-</i>

01:15:23.391 --> 01:15:25.643
<i>Now, I have a very special
surprise for you...</i>

01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:29.480
<i>which was a surprise to me
as well until just now.</i>

01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:32.525
<i>Everybody, welcome
The Chipmunks!</i>

01:15:35.486 --> 01:15:36.487
Thanks, Ashley.

01:15:36.571 --> 01:15:38.406
Thanks.
Thank you.

01:15:39.156 --> 01:15:40.157
Um...

01:15:40.575 --> 01:15:42.243
Before we perform,

01:15:42.326 --> 01:15:45.204
my brothers and I have
a few things to set straight.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:46.831
Earlier this evening...

01:15:46.998 --> 01:15:50.710
we accidentally ruined
a very special evening...

01:15:50.877 --> 01:15:52.879
for a very special woman

01:15:53.004 --> 01:15:54.797
and we'd like to
make it up to her.

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:55.923
Yeah.

01:15:56.007 --> 01:15:57.049
Alice?

01:15:57.216 --> 01:15:59.176
Barry has something
he'd like to ask you.

01:15:59.343 --> 01:16:00.344
Again.

01:16:05.683 --> 01:16:07.184
Will you marry me this time?

01:16:07.852 --> 01:16:08.895
Yes.

01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:10.187
Aw.

01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:11.606
Yes.

01:16:16.193 --> 01:16:17.403
Thanks, Chipmunks.

01:16:18.195 --> 01:16:21.365
And we just had one more
quick thing to say.

01:16:21.532 --> 01:16:22.783
Dave“.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.577
We're really sorry.
We're sorry.

01:16:25.703 --> 01:16:27.872
So we wrote this
last song for you.

01:17:12.131 --> 01:17:13.799
Whoo!
Wow!

01:17:37.614 --> 01:17:39.324
Please welcome The Chipettes!

01:17:44.955 --> 01:17:45.914
Wow.

01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:12.816
Whoo!

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.769
I love you, Dave!

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:08.247
Thank you.
Nailed it.

01:19:08.413 --> 01:19:09.748
Thank you!

01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:10.958
Thank you, my 990N9-

01:19:12.918 --> 01:19:14.086
We still got it.

01:19:14.638 --> 01:19:16.223
Yeah! Whoo!

01:19:16.389 --> 01:19:17.724
Girls, thank you.

01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:19.226
We owe you one.

01:19:19.392 --> 01:19:22.562
You owe us way more than one,
but, you're welcome.

01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:25.023
Guys, we have to
get back to auditions.

01:19:25.106 --> 01:19:27.567
Ryan's been
texting me like crazy.

01:19:27.734 --> 01:19:30.153
Come on, girls. Let's roll.

01:19:31.112 --> 01:19:33.448
Bye, Theodore-able.

01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:38.245
Miles, that was amazing!

01:19:38.787 --> 01:19:40.747
Dave, we're so sorry

01:19:40.831 --> 01:19:43.083
we came to Miami
without telling you.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.418
We just didn't wanna lose you.

01:19:45.752 --> 01:19:46.753
Lose me?

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.755
Why would you guys ever think
you were gonna lose me?

01:19:48.922 --> 01:19:50.757
Because you said
you're starting

01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:52.300
a new chapter in your life.

01:19:52.467 --> 01:19:54.761
We thought you might
bail on us.

01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:56.972
Technically,
we're not even a family.

01:19:57.138 --> 01:19:58.932
We're just three chipmunks
who live with you.

01:19:59.683 --> 01:20:01.601
Is that what you guys think?

01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:03.311
I mean, I know I haven't

01:20:03.436 --> 01:20:05.272
really been around much
lately, and...

01:20:05.438 --> 01:20:07.107
things are changing for us,

01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:08.942
but I'd never
bail on you guys.

01:20:09.317 --> 01:20:11.111
Because we are a family.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.864
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

01:20:16.449 --> 01:20:18.451
And I was probably
a little over-the-top

01:20:18.535 --> 01:20:20.620
on the whole
"no music" thing, okay?

01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:22.497
You guys can perform.
All right!

01:20:22.664 --> 01:20:24.165
But locally. Okay?

01:20:24.332 --> 01:20:25.333
Sure!

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:28.295
And I promise to be a better
dad from here on out.

01:20:28.461 --> 01:20:30.630
What are you
talking about, Dave?

01:20:30.797 --> 01:20:33.800
You're the best dad
we could ever have.

01:20:35.051 --> 01:20:36.511
What do you say to
a little family dinner

01:20:36.636 --> 01:20:37.721
when we get home?

01:20:37.888 --> 01:20:39.306
You know, so we know where

01:20:39.389 --> 01:20:41.057
our kids are the entire time
we're together?

01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:42.434
That sounds perfect.

01:20:42.517 --> 01:20:43.894
Whoo-hoo! We rocked it!

01:20:43.977 --> 01:20:47.314
Simon, did you see me?
I was on fire!.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.107
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:50.984
but I had fun getting
in trouble with you guys.

01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:52.736
The trip might be over,

01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:54.237
but as long as
Alvin is around,

01:20:54.321 --> 01:20:55.822
we'll always get into trouble.

01:20:55.989 --> 01:20:57.657
Thanks,SH
Not a compliment.

01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.076
My God,
you guys were awesome.

01:21:00.702 --> 01:21:01.703
Hey, Miles, right?

01:21:02.829 --> 01:21:04.372
WOW, you played great!

01:21:04.539 --> 01:21:06.082
Thanks! Your cool song...

01:21:06.249 --> 01:21:10.420
I mean... I love when...
Music with your mouth...

01:21:10.587 --> 01:21:12.047
Brother....

01:21:13.256 --> 01:21:15.008
You're great.
Thank you.

01:21:15.175 --> 01:21:16.343
She bought it.

01:21:16.509 --> 01:21:18.303
Anyways, I have this party

01:21:18.386 --> 01:21:20.764
I'm supposed to go to
in L.A. Saturday night...

01:21:20.931 --> 01:21:21.973
if, um, maybe you'd wanna...

01:21:22.057 --> 01:21:23.058
Definitely, yeah.

01:21:23.224 --> 01:21:24.434
I'd, definitely
would like to...

01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:26.019
Yes. Definitely.

01:21:26.186 --> 01:21:28.063
Okay. Well then
I'll definitely,

01:21:28.188 --> 01:21:29.940
definitely see you there.

01:21:30.106 --> 01:21:31.107
Okay.

01:21:31.691 --> 01:21:33.234
Bye.
Bye.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.612
Smooth, Miles.

01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:37.864
Real smooth.

01:21:38.031 --> 01:21:39.199
Bye.

01:21:40.033 --> 01:21:41.284
All right!
Hey, ready?

01:21:41.451 --> 01:21:42.452
Yeah.

01:21:42.619 --> 01:21:43.620
Bye, guys.

01:21:45.288 --> 01:21:46.873
Come on, guys. Let's go home.

01:21:47.874 --> 01:21:50.543
Should we remind him we're
on the No-Fly List?

01:21:50.961 --> 01:21:52.545
Definitely not.

01:22:08.436 --> 01:22:10.188
Um,
this doesn't look like home.

01:22:10.271 --> 01:22:11.272
It's not.

01:22:11.398 --> 01:22:12.399
We have one more
important thing

01:22:12.482 --> 01:22:13.775
to do before we go home.

01:22:13.942 --> 01:22:16.444
Dave, we've been
driving for three days!

01:22:16.611 --> 01:22:17.612
Can't it wait?

01:22:17.779 --> 01:22:19.197
Unfortunately not, boys.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.657
The courthouse
is closed tomorrow.

01:22:21.157 --> 01:22:22.742
I'm sorry, the what house?

01:22:23.576 --> 01:22:25.078
Are we going to jail?

01:22:25.245 --> 01:22:26.955
We didn't mean to cause an
emergency landing, Dave!

01:22:27.122 --> 01:22:28.581
It was freezing in cargo!

01:22:29.124 --> 01:22:32.585
Does this look like a face
that will survive prison?

01:22:34.462 --> 01:22:35.588
Come on.

01:22:37.674 --> 01:22:38.717
Dave Seville?

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.801
Yep, that's me.

01:22:40.343 --> 01:22:41.344
By signing this...

01:22:41.428 --> 01:22:43.763
you not only agree
to take care of,

01:22:43.847 --> 01:22:45.140
but to provide for the health,

01:22:45.265 --> 01:22:46.683
welfare and
educafionalneedsu.

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:48.601
Of Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:50.145
I do.

01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:52.939
Alvin, Simon and Theodore,
do you agree to this adoption?

01:22:53.106 --> 01:22:54.274
Adoption?

01:22:54.607 --> 01:22:56.651
That's why we're here?

01:22:57.610 --> 01:22:59.779
You're adopting us?

01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:00.989
You guys were right.

01:23:01.614 --> 01:23:04.034
Even though you consider me
to be your dad, and...

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.661
I love you like my own sons,
it's never been official.

01:23:06.828 --> 01:23:08.496
So I figured...

01:23:08.663 --> 01:23:10.290
let's make it official.

01:23:17.464 --> 01:23:18.465
Chipmunks?

01:23:18.798 --> 01:23:19.799
Yes?

01:23:21.468 --> 01:23:24.095
I still need you to say
something like "I agree."

01:23:24.179 --> 01:23:25.472
Just to make it legal.

01:23:26.473 --> 01:23:28.558
Yeah! I agree!

01:23:29.142 --> 01:23:30.643
Yeah. Me, too!

01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:32.103
1,000%!

01:23:32.187 --> 01:23:33.438
And that's not even
a real number.

01:23:34.856 --> 01:23:37.150
Does this mean we're Sevilles?

01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:39.652
On this day...

01:23:39.819 --> 01:23:41.571
David Seville has
officially adopted

01:23:41.654 --> 01:23:44.032
Alvin, Simon and Theodore
to be his children.

01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:45.950
You three now have
all the legal rights

01:23:46.034 --> 01:23:47.160
of any natural child.

01:23:47.327 --> 01:23:48.495
Or, chipmunk.

01:23:49.496 --> 01:23:53.166
I hereby sign this order
confirming this adoption.

01:23:53.249 --> 01:23:54.292
Congratulations.

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:55.376
Thank you.

01:23:55.502 --> 01:23:56.503
Whoo-hoo!
Yay!

01:23:58.088 --> 01:23:59.839
This is amazing! Yes!

01:24:00.006 --> 01:24:01.549
GUYS, guys... Just...

01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:03.510
Up high, Judge. Give me some.

01:24:03.676 --> 01:24:04.969
Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy!
Awesome!

01:24:05.053 --> 01:24:06.054
Dave!
Whoa!

01:24:06.179 --> 01:24:07.222
Sweet!

01:24:07.388 --> 01:24:08.431
Yes! We're a family!

01:24:08.598 --> 01:24:09.724
We have a dad. Legally.

01:24:09.891 --> 01:24:11.059
Okay.

01:24:11.226 --> 01:24:12.352
Okay, all right. Alvin, okay.

01:24:12.519 --> 01:24:13.645
What an amazing day!

01:24:14.896 --> 01:24:16.523
They're excited.
Yes!

01:24:22.862 --> 01:24:24.364
Hey, official and legal Dad?

01:24:24.531 --> 01:24:26.199
Yes, official and legal son?

01:24:26.366 --> 01:24:29.744
Thanks for being the best
official and legal dad, Dad.

01:24:29.911 --> 01:24:32.455
Well, you three are the best
official and legal sons

01:24:32.539 --> 01:24:34.582
an official and legal father
could ask for.

01:24:34.749 --> 01:24:37.085
Aw. That's sweet
of you to say, Dad.

01:24:37.252 --> 01:24:38.253
Yeah.

01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:41.548
But seriously, guys, this is
the happiest day of my life.

01:24:41.714 --> 01:24:43.883
Literally nothing
could ruin it for me.

01:24:49.055 --> 01:24:50.723
Boy.

01:24:50.974 --> 01:24:52.725
Alvin.

01:24:52.892 --> 01:24:55.228
Totally forgot about this.

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:03.820
Alvin!

01:25:18.126 --> 01:25:19.669
Which way is the pool?

01:25:22.797 --> 01:25:24.424
Thank you.

01:25:34.934 --> 01:25:36.269
<i>Got some bad news, muchacho.</i>

01:25:36.936 --> 01:25:40.190
The chairs are for
hotel guests only. Beat it.

01:25:40.315 --> 01:25:41.316
Okay.

01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:43.526
I got some bad news
for you, too, muchacho.

01:25:43.693 --> 01:25:44.694
I'm not moving.

01:25:44.777 --> 01:25:46.112
I was just stuck
in your elevator of death

01:25:46.196 --> 01:25:47.363
for hours and
I'm probably out of a job...

01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:48.865
so I'm gonna sit in this chair

01:25:48.948 --> 01:25:50.992
by this pool,
and I'm gonna relax.

01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:52.202
And if you got
a problem with it,

01:25:52.285 --> 01:25:53.953
you can carry me out.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.956
You can carry me out!
Carry me out! Go for it!

01:25:57.123 --> 01:25:58.625
Yes, sir.
Go for it!

01:25:59.959 --> 01:26:01.002
<i>EOh</i>

01:26:02.378 --> 01:26:03.630
That's him. That's the guy.

01:26:03.796 --> 01:26:05.632
Come on! Come on.

01:26:05.798 --> 01:26:07.342
What are you gonna do,
carry me out? Really?

01:26:07.467 --> 01:26:09.052
Okay, you are gonna
carry me out. Okay!

01:26:09.219 --> 01:26:10.220
Okay, this is fine!

01:26:10.386 --> 01:26:12.305
I've been looking
to relax all day!

01:26:12.472 --> 01:26:14.015
I'm like Cleopatra!

01:26:14.182 --> 01:26:15.183
Floating away!

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:17.060
I'm gonna chillax!

01:26:17.143 --> 01:26:19.437
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>

01:27:32.308 --> 01:27:36.061
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>

01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:43.792
