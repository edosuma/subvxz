WEBVTT

00:11.050 --> 00:14.050
[Des] There is some load of
money floating around here.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.140
Des.
Stop talking in my ear.

00:16.180 --> 00:17.890
I'm just saying that
everybody here is like

00:17.930 --> 00:19.100
fifty times richer than me.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.310
Stop talking in my ear
or I'll go up there

00:21.350 --> 00:22.930
and hang you from the flagpole
by your underwear.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.520
[Des] Aha. Joke's on you. I
don't wear underwear, okay.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.900
And I won't quit this fight. I
want more money from you weekly.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.360
Okay listen.
Why don't you focus

00:30.400 --> 00:32.700
on earning the money that
I actually pay you now.

00:32.740 --> 00:33.570
Alright?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.530
Hey! Dean Martin.

00:35.570 --> 00:36.910
Put the booze down.
We're working.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.620
All right.
Fine.

00:38.660 --> 00:39.830
You happy?

00:39.870 --> 00:40.450
This Australian Commissioner
guy, Garrett.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.540
He's paying us top dollar for
additional security.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.870
So look sharp.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.340
New threats.
Possible sabotage.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.710
Who knows?
All the same, I gotta say,

00:49.750 --> 00:50.670
these Aztec Week celebrations.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.760
They're pretty awesome.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.550
[Jake] ANZAC, idiot.
ANZAC, not Aztec.

00:54.590 --> 00:56.430
[Des]
Australian New Zealand

00:56.470 --> 00:57.600
Army Corp Week.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.850
Right. Right.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.600
Commemorating the
first major military action

01:00.640 --> 01:02.220
fought by those guys
during the First World War.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.060
See? I knows.
It happened in April.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.190
Put it down, I said.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.520
All right b'y.
Relax.

01:09.610 --> 01:11.440
Dad, I'm telling you.
This fella Garrett.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.530
He is seriously hitting on Rose.

01:13.570 --> 01:14.570
Biiiiiiig time.

01:20.450 --> 01:21.740
[Jake]
Ah, b'ys.

01:22.410 --> 01:23.460
My twelve o'clock.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.500
We got an employee
who's either quitting

01:27.540 --> 01:28.960
and going on a classy bender.

01:29.710 --> 01:30.790
Or a serious problem.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.550
I got your back.
Raise. Or no raise.

01:32.590 --> 01:33.800
Although
I'd really like a raise.

01:43.890 --> 01:45.940
Don't move please.
I got you.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.810
Take it easy!

01:48.860 --> 01:50.230
Uh! Uh!

01:50.270 --> 01:51.320
Oooh.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.150
Arrgh!

01:56.150 --> 01:57.240
Who is this?

01:59.200 --> 02:00.120
[punch]
Uhh!

02:00.160 --> 02:01.120
Ow!
[punch]

02:01.160 --> 02:02.120
[punch]

02:02.160 --> 02:03.580
Ow!
Stop punching me!

02:05.330 --> 02:07.790
[sound of alarm]

02:07.830 --> 02:08.790
Jimmy?

02:08.830 --> 02:09.380
Jake Doyle?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.340
You gotta be kidding me!

02:11.380 --> 02:12.630
Jake friggin Doyle?

02:15.010 --> 02:15.630
Doyle.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.420
You're under arrest.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.720
For aiding the escape
of a wanted felon.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.470
Lads when you arrest him, make
sure the cuffs are extra tight.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.850
And will somebody please
go after her!

02:34.150 --> 02:35.320
♪ Oh yeah ♪

02:35.360 --> 02:37.110
♪ Oh yeah ♪

02:37.150 --> 02:38.150

02:50.040 --> 02:53.000
I can't even begin to express
how badly you screwed up.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.050
Look Jimmy, I'm really sorry
that I kicked your ass.

02:55.090 --> 02:57.010
And broke your nose in front
of that super hot girl.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.340
You screwed up a takedown
of an international art thief

02:59.380 --> 03:00.760
who I've been following
for ten years.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.260
What is all this?

03:02.300 --> 03:05.010
Aw. I'm afraid this is way above
your pay grade, Constable.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.350
It's classified.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.310
Excuse me. Who are you?
And why is Jake in cuffs?

03:08.350 --> 03:10.520
Well that's not information that
I can share with you right now.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.400
But if you know
this moron at all,

03:12.440 --> 03:14.190
I'm sure you can come up with
your own conclusions.

03:14.230 --> 03:15.570
Look don't mind him alright?
He's just, like,

03:15.610 --> 03:17.150
exercising his authority.

03:24.740 --> 03:25.870
Can I talk to you?

03:26.450 --> 03:27.660
Make it quick.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.580
Jake Doyle.
You give him special treatment.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.080
Why are we talking about this?

03:32.120 --> 03:34.540
It just feels like you give him
extreme preferential treatment.

03:34.580 --> 03:37.010
And to be honest,
it's affecting your job.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.880
I'm disappointed in you.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.840
You're disappointed?

03:39.880 --> 03:40.170
You heard me.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.010
Constable.
Move away from my desk.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.470
What do you mean?

03:44.510 --> 03:45.310
Walk away.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.810
And don't you have work to do?

03:47.850 --> 03:49.390
- I --
- Go make yourself useful.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.690
And increase security at
The Rooms immediately.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.390
Make sure everything

03:52.440 --> 03:54.190
in that Museum
is locked down tight.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.070
Are you sure you want
to do that here?

04:01.110 --> 04:01.860
I'm highly trained.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.780
I can take this thing apart

04:03.820 --> 04:04.370
and put it back together
in ten seconds.

04:05.950 --> 04:09.200
Oh yeah. No doubt you can put
an arse right back in a cat.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.500
What can the RNC
do for you Corporal?

04:12.580 --> 04:13.120
[Jimmy]
Natalie Hirst.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.880
Specialty art thief who I've
been following for ten years.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.960
Why am I here?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.670
Whatever she's after
at The Rooms,

04:20.710 --> 04:22.590
she's going to need to re-group
and come up with a new plan.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.970
And I'm gonna be there
again to stop her.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.720
Hello!
Why am I here?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.720
Jake.
Stop talking.

04:29.220 --> 04:29.600
Thank you.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.140
My orders are to operate
at an arm’s length

04:33.190 --> 04:33.230
from any local police force.

04:34.730 --> 04:38.940
So my superior has ordered me
to hire private help.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.780
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
No way!

04:42.820 --> 04:44.240
You think I want
to work with you?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.200
Believe me Doyle --

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
No matter
what anybody says, Jake.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.820
You get the job done.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.370
I got my own cases and my own
partners to worry about, okay?

04:50.410 --> 04:52.790
The last thing I needs is this
friggin' accident prone

04:52.830 --> 04:55.290
gravity-challenged ginger
following me around all day.

04:55.330 --> 04:56.210
- Ginger?
- Jake!

04:57.080 --> 04:58.290
Please don't use that term.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.340
It is derogatory.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.420
Ginger's derogatory?

05:00.460 --> 05:02.630
And there are charges pending

05:02.670 --> 05:06.260
regarding your interfering in
a federal police investigation.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.850
Am I even going to get paid

05:08.890 --> 05:10.140
for helping
Little Orphan Annie here?

05:10.180 --> 05:11.770
The satisfaction of helping your
country

05:11.810 --> 05:12.850
should be payment enough.

05:12.890 --> 05:14.440
Take the deal, Jake.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.850
Meet me outside.

05:15.890 --> 05:17.310
I have a lead
we need to follow up on.

05:21.650 --> 05:22.900
Oh, thank you so much for that.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.860
And what's wrong
with you anyway?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.150
You're acting all --

05:25.200 --> 05:27.490
Barbary? I'm just dealing
with some family issues.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.120
It's nothing serious.

05:30.080 --> 05:30.120
Oh.

05:31.410 --> 05:33.000
You know what might
take your mind off it?

05:34.080 --> 05:34.960
Making out.

05:43.550 --> 05:44.420
Thank you.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.180
Good bye, Jake.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.810
[Rose] Yes. Everything's
under control.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.310
Police have extra security.
We should be fine.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.730
I have to say

06:00.770 --> 06:02.820
I'm not comfortable
with the extra police presence.

06:02.860 --> 06:02.900
Why is that?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.820
Just takes away from
the spirit of celebration.

06:07.570 --> 06:08.740
All these cops about.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.070
But I have to say, though, Rose.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.040
You've been spectacular,
in every way.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.950
Wish I could
say the same for Malaki.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.870
Malachy.
Malachy.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.420
That's what I said. Malaki.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.040
Ow b'y.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.170
Garrett, do you think
the attempted robbery

06:22.210 --> 06:23.880
had anything to do with your
celebrations tonight?

06:24.840 --> 06:26.550
Was there any reason why anyone

06:26.590 --> 06:28.470
would want to
sabotage this event?

06:28.510 --> 06:30.840
I can assure you your son's
little episode had nothing

06:30.890 --> 06:32.430
to do with me
and the ANZEC event.

06:32.470 --> 06:33.760
Just keep your eyes peeled.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.640
And keep your son away from me.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.640
[crash]

06:38.440 --> 06:39.650
You okay there?

06:40.310 --> 06:41.310
Fine.
Thanks.

06:42.150 --> 06:43.230
Do your job.

06:45.190 --> 06:46.320
Malachy.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.900
This is a big pay day for us

06:47.950 --> 06:49.030
and I'm a big girl.

06:49.070 --> 06:50.320
I can handle him.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.280
There's something Garret's
not telling us.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.530
Can we get this going?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.910
Or do you want to change your
clothes again?

06:55.950 --> 06:57.160
I find it hilarious
that you're like,

06:57.200 --> 06:58.620
zero, for twenty
trying to catch this gal.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.960
Whoa, whoa.
Your car looks terrible.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.960
Black interior.
Standard transmission.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.420
This is a different car.
What happened?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just forget about that. Okay?

07:09.760 --> 07:11.130
What I want to know

07:11.180 --> 07:13.430
is what you got going on in your
little red headed brain.

07:13.470 --> 07:14.680
And how you're going
to catch her.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.680
Natalie is not to be
mis-underestimated.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.850
Mis-underestimated isn't a word.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.230
Irregardless.
She's a criminal mastermind.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.690
And I've never been able
to catch her.

07:23.730 --> 07:25.110
All disrespect intended Jimmy,

07:25.150 --> 07:26.650
but you wouldn't be able
to catch the clap.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.860
Natalie's been pursued by every
police force in the world.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.530
And no one has caught her, so...

07:30.570 --> 07:32.570
Do you even know what we're
supposed to be protecting?

07:32.610 --> 07:33.780
I mean, what she's after?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.030
No. Not yet. But,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.330
I do have a lead.
I tracked her to an address.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.410
See I did a search
of all her known aliases.

07:39.450 --> 07:40.620
And I came up with a hit.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.830
She is renting
a parking space downtown.

07:42.870 --> 07:46.590
Your mastermind used a known
alias to rent a parking space

07:46.630 --> 07:48.510
in a city that she knows
you've tracked her to.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.720
Nothing suspicious
about that at all?

07:51.760 --> 07:52.130
She obviously slipped up.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.510
Everybody does it
from time to time.

07:54.550 --> 07:56.550
It's a setup.
Jimmy. If you ask me,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.850
we go back to The Rooms
and we stake it out.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.640
Figure out what she's trying
to steal and catch her doing it.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.140
I'm in charge..

08:02.190 --> 08:04.560
Okay, I think I've told you
this, like, a hundred times.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.770
So shut your mouth
and let's drive away

08:06.820 --> 08:08.480
in this stupid poop-mobile.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.530
Jake.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.320
Jake.
Open the door Jake.

08:15.070 --> 08:16.160
Open the door!

08:16.580 --> 08:17.740
Jake!

08:19.620 --> 08:22.290
You're friggin kidding me!
You're kidding me.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.420
I know that.
But it's out of my control.

08:31.630 --> 08:32.840
Yes, yes!

08:42.310 --> 08:44.480
[sound of camera phone]

08:47.480 --> 08:49.280
It is secure.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.110
Please. I'll do anything.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.070
Hello?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.210
[Jimmy] She's been here. I
can sense these things .

09:05.250 --> 09:06.500
So knock it off.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.210
Oh, so you're a
clairvoyant, now, are you Jimmy?

09:08.250 --> 09:09.630
Because myself,

09:09.670 --> 09:11.840
I always thought you had
the instincts of a potted plant.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.050
You know, first of all,

09:13.090 --> 09:15.220
these attacks on my confidence
do not help.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.260
And B: Although I have never
caught Natalie.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.930
I have foiled her plans,
like, a bunch of times.

09:20.970 --> 09:21.970
Foiled?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.520
Yes. Foiled
her robbery attempts.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.150
The Glenbow in Calgary,
La Maison Rouge in Paris

09:27.190 --> 09:28.560
and the National Gallery
in London.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.820
Why am I defending
myself to you?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.530
Jimmy? Why would she leave you
a heart made out of lipstick,

09:37.570 --> 09:40.160
right next to the parking spot
that she rented?

09:41.410 --> 09:42.370
What, Natalie?

09:46.410 --> 09:48.380
Obviously,
she's leaving you a message.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.840
[bang]

09:56.760 --> 09:58.180
What is it, like a catalogue?

09:58.220 --> 09:58.930
It's a program from The Rooms.

10:00.470 --> 10:03.180
So not only is she telling you
she's gonna rob something.

10:03.220 --> 10:04.180
She's telling us where.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.270
Why would she do that?

10:06.310 --> 10:07.690
[Jimmy]
One of the pages is missing.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.440
[car engine rumbling]

10:12.940 --> 10:13.940
Natalie!

10:16.400 --> 10:17.740
Who the hell is this now?

10:18.450 --> 10:19.620
Angus.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.030
Natalie.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.790
It's time we settled accounts,
don't you think?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.490
Who's Angus?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.790
[Angus] We really should
talk about this Natalie.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.630
Drop it.
You're under arrest.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.550
Easy there now red.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.130
I mean it.

10:37.010 --> 10:37.970
See what you did?

10:38.010 --> 10:39.390
You broke my gun!

10:39.430 --> 10:40.430
What?

10:40.470 --> 10:41.430
Whoa!

10:42.930 --> 10:43.930
Ooh!

10:44.600 --> 10:45.600
[punch]

10:45.640 --> 10:47.270
- Wolf?
- Hey Jake!

10:47.730 --> 10:48.690
Ooh!

10:48.730 --> 10:49.560
Arrgh!

10:50.020 --> 10:51.270
[punch]

10:51.650 --> 10:52.820
Ow!

10:55.150 --> 10:56.490
[car squeals]

10:58.030 --> 10:58.780
[car squeals again]

10:59.410 --> 11:00.450
Jimmy look out!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.620
[crash]

11:05.580 --> 11:05.910
Jimmy.

11:06.910 --> 11:08.710
Hey Wolf.
What are you doing here?

11:12.130 --> 11:15.000
[Des]
Hospital mobile office.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.050
I knows you don't love it,
eh b'y.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.880
Wolf, what are you even doing
here anyways?

11:19.920 --> 11:21.430
Heard Jimmy's little girlfriend
was in town,

11:21.470 --> 11:22.680
so the Boss said
to keep an eye on her.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.760
Who's the beast?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.680
His name is Angus Ferriss--
A thug.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.850
I got a feeling he's tracking
whatever Natalie is after.

11:28.890 --> 11:29.890
Why?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.140
Natalie gets herself in trouble

11:31.190 --> 11:33.310
with a variety of
dangerous people.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.650
Angus is one
of the worst there is.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.030
Ughh. My nose is killing me.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.200
My leg is killing me.
At least it's not broken.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.780
You're a lucky guy.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.450
Lucky? Last time I saw you, you
broke this leg three times.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.450
Now I have arthritisises.

11:45.490 --> 11:46.950
[Des] You know, I was shot
in the stomach once.

11:46.990 --> 11:48.750
And now, when it's foggy,
I get heartburn.

11:48.790 --> 11:48.830
What's all this?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.920
You know, I'm actually
available for extra work

11:51.960 --> 11:53.540
at a rate of pay
that is obviously way below

11:53.580 --> 11:54.790
what I consider to be

11:54.830 --> 11:56.590
fair in an open market system.

11:56.630 --> 11:57.300
What?

11:58.420 --> 11:59.920
I mean that I've
tracked all the items

11:59.960 --> 12:01.300
that Natalie
stole over the years.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.930
So, green dots are for
successful heists.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.890
And red dots are for when
Jimmy's thwarted her.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.510
Now I'm just trying
to see a pattern.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.310
Did you find one?

12:08.350 --> 12:09.520
Not a one.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.060
Yeah, I've never know
what her target was.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.940
It's part of her brilliance.
No consistency.

12:12.980 --> 12:14.060
Yeah, like Jimmy's work.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.190
[Des laughs]

12:15.230 --> 12:17.070
For some reason,
she left you this clue.

12:17.110 --> 12:18.570
God knows why.
But I'm telling you,

12:18.610 --> 12:19.650
it's all connected to the

12:19.690 --> 12:21.400
Australian ceremonies
at The Rooms.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.820
Oh, no, ah, totally, totally.
I found a copy of the catalogue.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.530
Now the one you found
had a page missing.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.200
Now one side is

12:27.240 --> 12:28.450
recent acquisitions
at The Rooms.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.200
It's great stuff,
but nothing priceless.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.500
The other side is
an upcoming exhibit

12:32.540 --> 12:34.210
of rare
Newfoundland currency.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.920
The Rowe Collection.
What the hell is that?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.250
[Des]
Well, I'm glad you asked.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.420
See, in 1949, Newfoundland
joined Canada, right?

12:39.460 --> 12:41.630
Before then, we had, like,
our own Nation.

12:41.670 --> 12:42.670
Our own government.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.180
Our own Prime Minister.
Our own --

12:44.220 --> 12:45.140
--currency.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.300
This collection
is worth a fortune.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.140
Half decent payday.
It could be what Angus is after.

12:51.180 --> 12:52.600
[phone rings]

12:55.600 --> 12:57.810
- Dad. What?
- Dad what?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.940
I'm sorry. I'm in a bit
of a hurry. What do you want?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.490
That's why I'm calling you.
Dum dum.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.900
This guy Garrett.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.160
Yeah, yeah. The guy who's
infatuated with Rose. Go on.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.950
I got a feeling he's tied into
this

13:06.990 --> 13:08.910
attempted robbery thing.
You got a pen?

13:08.950 --> 13:10.540
I don't need a pen.
Just hurry up.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.910
749 Parade Street.
I checked into the address.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.580
It's a temporary holding area

13:15.620 --> 13:17.540
for exhibitions
slated for The Rooms.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.670
Sounds like it could
be related to your case.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.880
You're sure this is not some
kind of jealousy thing

13:22.920 --> 13:24.470
about the guy
that could be my new dad.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.390
Just follow up
and get back to me.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.600
Des. Great work man.
And the detail.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.600
Very well done.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.640
Ha, ha.
It's a basic formula.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.350
Three parts want,
eight parts talent.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.020
And it's its own reward
since the monetary one

13:38.060 --> 13:39.110
doesn't really factor in much.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.610
Let's go, alright?
Des, stay on this.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.070
Wolf, will you give him a hand?

13:42.110 --> 13:44.110
We could use your help,
given your particular skill set.

13:44.150 --> 13:46.820
No problems. Keep this fella
in one piece, will ya?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.530
You knows we're gonna end up
carrying him later on.

13:48.570 --> 13:49.780
All right.
Let's go.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.370
And I'm in charge
of this investigation.

13:51.410 --> 13:54.120
So stop with the "Let's do this
and let's do that stuff."

13:55.330 --> 13:56.250
[bang]

14:02.300 --> 14:02.840
Hi.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.340
[Rose]
Hey Mal.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.760
We were just discussing the
details of tonight's dinner.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
I was wondering
if maybe you

14:08.720 --> 14:10.930
would join me at the
head table tonight, Rose.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.970
Just to keep an eye on things
from up close, of course.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.430
Of course. I --

14:15.480 --> 14:18.060
We could probably
work that out. Yeah.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.020
Great.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.780
You're not sitting
at the dinner table with him.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.570
I'm not?

14:24.610 --> 14:27.700
I mean, you shouldn't have to.
He is a massive tool.

14:28.570 --> 14:30.370
[Rose]
Oh honey. Come on.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.330
Relax. Trust me.
I'll be fine.

14:32.370 --> 14:32.660
Just one last thing.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.870
Is there anything special
planned for the final ceremony?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.330
I know you're
suspicious of me Malaki.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.710
Hmmff!

14:39.750 --> 14:41.880
My government is planning
on presenting the province

14:41.920 --> 14:44.880
with a collection to add
to the Newfoundland Sterling.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.300
The Rowe Collection.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.880
And thanks for being such
a good sport about Rose.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.640
[Jake] They store items
here to be catalogued

14:57.680 --> 14:58.690
before they're moved
to The Rooms

14:58.730 --> 15:00.190
to go on exhibition.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.560
The currency, Natalie's next
target, is in this building?

15:02.610 --> 15:03.610
Maybe.

15:03.650 --> 15:04.860
Okay.
Keep your eyes peeled.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.570
She's as cunning
as she is exquisite.

15:06.610 --> 15:08.530
Man, you are obsessed
with this girl.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.240
I'm not obsessed.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.780
I'm sorry.
You're in love with this girl.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.990
No. The only thing I'm in love
with is her awesome talent.

15:14.030 --> 15:15.240
Okay. I respect her.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.290
Like Sherlock
respects his Moriarity.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.750
Except Natalie is way hotter.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.670
And in this case,
Sherlock is a lot dumber.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.840
[Jake] It's unlocked.
Someone's here.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.630
Nope.
Everything sees okay.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.130
We beat her to the punch.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.140
She left the door open.
You'd think, Jimmy,

15:33.180 --> 15:34.600
after all these years
of chasing her,

15:34.640 --> 15:36.430
you'd have at least
one instinct as a cop.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.470
You know, you're really
starting to bug me Doyle.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.850
When this is all over, you and
I are gonna settle some scores.

15:40.890 --> 15:41.900
Shut up.

15:41.940 --> 15:42.980
You shut up!

15:43.020 --> 15:44.310
Seriously.
Shut up!

15:44.360 --> 15:45.610
No. You know what?
I'm totally sick of this.

15:45.650 --> 15:46.690
Totally sick.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.440
Don't you hear that?
Shut up!

15:48.490 --> 15:49.450
Alright.
You know what?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.490
I'll even let you
get the first punch, huh?

15:52.530 --> 15:54.070
Come on! Come on!
I friggin' dare you.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.700
[explosion]

16:03.960 --> 16:06.130
[Leslie] Jake we've taken
an inventory of the warehouse.

16:06.170 --> 16:09.550
My leg is broken.
Plus the nose. Again.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.880
Bruised ribs. Concussion.
I'm sure I look terrible.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.970
But thanks to my blurred vision,
I can't really tell!

16:14.010 --> 16:15.220
The only thing missing
from the vault.

16:15.260 --> 16:15.850
Is the Newfoundland
Currency Collection.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
And you don't have a
scratch on you. Not one!

16:20.140 --> 16:21.640
It sucks to be Jimmy,
I'd say.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.770
Were there people working
the ceremony at The Rooms?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.980
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
Shane Garrett is involved.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.190
- Keep me posted.
- [ring]

16:28.110 --> 16:29.530
- Yeah?
- What do you got?

16:29.570 --> 16:30.610
Well, good news.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.110
Rose's new boyfriend,
Shane Garrett?

16:32.150 --> 16:33.610
I'm pretty sure he's
involved in all of this.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.240
I figured as much.
Watch your mouth.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.660
Alright.
You just keep an eye on him.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.790
Oh. I'll keep
a very close eye on him.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.330
I'm dying to take him down.

16:40.370 --> 16:41.620
Let me know
if anything comes up.

16:41.660 --> 16:43.250
- Ohh!
- [thud]

16:45.460 --> 16:47.000
It's not jealousy.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.710
This is a big gig for us, Mal.
We're making triple our rate.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.130
I appreciate that.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.720
But working security for this
dirtbag is not worth it.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.010
The worst is over.

16:56.050 --> 16:57.300
And I'm sure he hasn't
given me a second thought

16:57.350 --> 16:58.560
since the last time we spoke.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.350
- What's this?
- What that?

17:00.850 --> 17:05.440
Um. Oh, "A beautiful dress
for a beautiful Rose. SVG."

17:05.480 --> 17:06.980
- SVG?
- Shane Vincent Garrett.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.310
You know his middle name?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.150
You know you're so cute when
you're not jealous.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.530
Why don't you touch
base with Leslie?

17:12.570 --> 17:13.820
See if she can question Garrett.

17:13.860 --> 17:14.860
Maybe I will.

17:14.910 --> 17:15.950
In any event,

17:17.620 --> 17:17.660
there's no way

17:18.950 --> 17:21.330
I'm going to be wearing
his hideous dress.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.870
Okay, it's not that hideous.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.790
But still...

17:29.040 --> 17:30.090
[Des] Okay. So I'm working on

17:30.130 --> 17:31.380
a position on that
missing crate.

17:31.420 --> 17:34.220
Which, I must say, is crazy
fast, even for me.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.180
And well, Wolf is out
tracking down a lead.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.220
Great work, Des.
Keep this up.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.800
I'm going to steal you away
from the Doyles.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.810
Well do you have,
like, a brochure.

17:41.850 --> 17:44.270
Or like a website
you can direct me to?

17:44.310 --> 17:46.480
Because contract talks with Jake
seem to have halted.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.770
Keep on him.
You'll wear him down.

17:47.810 --> 17:48.980
Man, she is hot.

17:49.020 --> 17:49.270
[Jimmy]
She is.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.440
You wanna hear something crazy?

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
Always.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.610
I'm a little
infatuated with her.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.110
You know,
I've been tracking her.

17:56.150 --> 17:56.860
Studying her every move
for so long.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.200
It actually feels like --

17:59.240 --> 18:02.740
Like you're together, together?
Like as one -- but separately?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.290
Yes.

18:04.330 --> 18:06.250
I mean, I haven't even
actually met her yet.

18:06.290 --> 18:07.120
Maybe that's the way
it should be.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.330
Maybe we should never meet them.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.750
Because that way they can't
break your heart over

18:11.800 --> 18:14.460
and over and over again.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.550
You know?
And right to your face.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.720
[ding]

18:18.760 --> 18:19.970
Oh. I got it.
I got it.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.680
It's within five miles
of Mile One Stadium.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.810
So I can text you the exact
address. Let's go.

18:24.850 --> 18:25.980
You need back-up?

18:26.020 --> 18:27.190
No no no.
We might scare her off.

18:27.230 --> 18:28.270
We should go alone.

18:34.570 --> 18:35.740
What can I do for you constable?

18:35.780 --> 18:37.150
I know you're working
a security gig

18:37.200 --> 18:38.200
for the High Commissioner
Shane Garrett.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.490
Her majesty Leslie Bennett

18:40.530 --> 18:42.280
thinks he might be involved in
a case I'm working on.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.240
Her majesty?

18:43.280 --> 18:44.290
Just answer the question please.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.500
There was no question.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.370
The Australian connection
with the ceremony.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.920
The incident at the Art Gallery.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.620
And now the missing
Newfoundland Currency?

18:50.670 --> 18:52.380
Which the Australian Government
had purchased.

18:52.420 --> 18:54.420
And was donating to The Rooms.
I hear you.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.630
Still no question.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.510
Is it connected?
Is Shane Garrett involved?

18:57.550 --> 18:59.130
If you'd like
this ex cop's advice,

18:59.180 --> 19:00.760
sounds to me

19:00.800 --> 19:03.640
like you might want to have a
friendly chat with Mr. Garrett.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.220
A friendly chat.
I have nothing on him.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.680
I could invite him somewhere,

19:07.730 --> 19:10.190
where you could just happen
to bump into him. Like...

19:10.230 --> 19:13.110
A bar maybe? The Duke.
Fifteen minutes.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.070
Okay.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.860
What's next?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.530
I just have to pop into the Duke

19:22.570 --> 19:24.080
to see some fireworks.

19:24.740 --> 19:24.780
What?

19:26.120 --> 19:29.580
Might not be Gucci.
But it's pretty damn hot.

19:40.970 --> 19:43.010
Hey. I had an epiphany with Des.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.430
Oh, this'll be worth the cash.

19:45.470 --> 19:47.350
No, no. I'm serious.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.350
What was it? Please tell me.
I'm dying to know.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.980
Natalie and me. You know.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.600
We've been in each other's
lives for so many years,

19:53.650 --> 19:55.560
in a very non-present
kind of way.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.030
In that you've been stalking
her across the planet. Go on.

19:58.070 --> 20:02.660
We've been alone. Together, but
separate for all major holidays.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.370
She sends flowers for
my mother's birthday.

20:05.490 --> 20:06.830
Well, that is actually
kind of sweet.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.540
It's the most functional
relationship I've ever had.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.580
To be honest with you,
I kinda know how that feels.

20:12.620 --> 20:12.670
Nah man.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.500
I see the chemistry between
you and Leslie. Hey.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.880
It's pretty clear that you're
gonna have her babies.

20:20.340 --> 20:23.140
If you mean, she could
potentially have my babies...

20:24.590 --> 20:27.720
Then yeah, I think Leslie
would be a fantastic mother.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.270
What do we got here?

20:34.270 --> 20:36.060
Looks big enough
to hold some old currency.

20:36.650 --> 20:39.110
[shower running]

20:39.150 --> 20:40.820
Oh crap.
It's her.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.110
It's Natalie.
She's in there in the shower?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.660
Oh man.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.910
You freaking out there Jimmy?
You might see a bit of leg?

20:47.950 --> 20:50.000
Oh my god.
Natalie's leg?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.200
I mean, I --

20:51.250 --> 20:53.080
I think I could handle that.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.120
I mean, I would turn away
as a gentleman.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.920
But then again, it would be
right there in front of me.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.290
And I'm human,
after all.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.670
Jimmy shut up.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.180
There's your leg,
Jimmy b'y.

21:08.010 --> 21:08.970
Ugh!

21:10.520 --> 21:11.560
Help me Doyle!

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
Oooh!

21:12.640 --> 21:15.900
Just, just,
Just play dead Jimmy.

21:15.940 --> 21:16.860
Help me!

21:20.940 --> 21:22.490
[Jimmy]
What are you doing?

21:23.860 --> 21:25.110
Ahh, my leg!

21:26.610 --> 21:28.700
Doyle! Ah! gross!
Oh it's gross!

21:30.660 --> 21:31.620
Doyle help!

21:31.660 --> 21:34.000
Arrgh! Help!

21:34.040 --> 21:35.210
[reloading]

21:35.250 --> 21:36.460
Aright, alright. Alright.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.130
Get your naked arse
off Jimmy's face. Please.

21:39.170 --> 21:40.210
[Jimmy]
Grrr!

21:40.250 --> 21:41.340
I'm gonna be sick.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.090
Put a housecoat on, will ya?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.010
For the love of God.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.510
[Jimmy retches]

21:51.850 --> 21:52.720
Hello?

21:53.350 --> 21:54.270
Rose?

21:55.690 --> 21:56.980
Looking for someone?

21:57.020 --> 21:58.560
I received a text from Rose

21:58.600 --> 22:00.150
asking me to meet
here for a drink.

22:00.190 --> 22:00.230
She's busy.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.740
But this lady here would like
to ask you a few questions.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.320
[Monica] Why did you hire the
Doyle as extra security?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.780
Did you receive
information that someone

22:08.820 --> 22:10.030
was going to try
to steal the currency?

22:10.990 --> 22:12.660
Sorry.
She made me tell her.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.870
The extra security was strictly
a precaution based on

22:17.920 --> 22:19.670
the value of the
gift my government

22:19.710 --> 22:21.590
was about to
present to Newfoundland.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.500
So you don't know her?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.590
No, I have no idea who that is?

22:25.630 --> 22:27.470
Listen, as you can imagine

22:27.510 --> 22:29.430
I've got a lot of fires to
put out before tonight's Gala.

22:30.510 --> 22:31.970
I don't want to go
over your head.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.770
But just to be clear, I will.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.600
Don't' think about jumping
on that private jet

22:36.640 --> 22:37.940
of yours until you hear from me.

22:37.980 --> 22:38.940
Got it?

22:38.980 --> 22:42.190
Enough of this.
Get back to work.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.940
I'd stay on that one,
if I were you.

22:53.080 --> 22:53.950
[Jimmy's stomach growls]

22:53.990 --> 22:55.160
I think I'm gonna puke again.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.330
Where are the actual
contents to the crate?

22:57.370 --> 22:59.290
You know, the colorful
Newfoundland money.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.330
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.340
I had no idea this crate
was even in here.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.090
You're disgusting.
You know that?

23:05.130 --> 23:07.590
Easier question.
Where's Natalie?

23:07.630 --> 23:08.800
We know you two
were working together.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.180
Not together.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.720
Natalie is in town after
the same thing I was after.

23:12.760 --> 23:12.970
The currency collection?

23:14.220 --> 23:17.850
Yeah, right.
The currency thing. Whatever.

23:17.890 --> 23:19.350
Look, I know her by reputation.

23:19.390 --> 23:20.900
So I tried to steal it first.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.650
But she beat me to it.

23:22.690 --> 23:24.270
Of course she did.
You moron.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.570
You're some hairy amateur.

23:25.610 --> 23:27.030
Nowhere near the caliber
of thief that Natalie is.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.150
We know you've been
keeping tabs on her.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.280
So where can we find her?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.330
She's your competition.
So, why protect her?

23:34.370 --> 23:36.120
I don't know what kind of game
she's playing.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.750
All I know is that she obviously

23:37.790 --> 23:38.830
planted this crate in here

23:38.870 --> 23:40.250
without me knowing about it.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.380
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
I know my rights.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.960
Well, well, well.

23:49.510 --> 23:52.550
There's enough here to put
you away for a while, brother.

23:52.590 --> 23:55.810
Plus a really gross disgusting
assault on a police officer.

23:55.850 --> 23:56.600
Where's Natalie?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.100
She's a smart cookie.

23:58.140 --> 24:01.140
She planted that crate here
to distract all of us. Why?

24:01.190 --> 24:03.560
If I was her, I'd be trying
to pull off the real job.

24:05.190 --> 24:08.190
At the Art Gallery at The Rooms.
And I'd be doing it right now.

24:08.230 --> 24:10.190
See? She's not after
the currency collection.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.650
I knew it.
It's gotta be something else.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.660
We haven't got
a lot of time.

24:13.700 --> 24:14.910
[Jake] If you were
gonna rob the place,

24:14.950 --> 24:16.280
where would
you enter the building?

24:17.120 --> 24:18.620
This better get me a deal.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.330
West entrance.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.080
I'd hide here.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.380
You're going
to the police station.

24:25.420 --> 24:28.500
Can you let me, you know,
at least put on some clothes.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.340
Come on! Oh!

24:30.380 --> 24:31.300
Oomph!

24:34.430 --> 24:37.800
Jimmy. We can't chase him and
stop Natalie at the same time.

24:37.850 --> 24:40.600
What is wrong with you?
You already saw this guy naked.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.140
Up close and personal
all over your face

24:42.180 --> 24:43.390
and yet you still turn away.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.020
Shut up!
It was too soon.

24:45.060 --> 24:46.400
Dad. Where are you?

24:46.440 --> 24:48.900
With the crap job of getting
this crap dinner secure.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.360
Okay, listen. Natalie's gonna
make her move any minute.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.280
Keep your eyes peeled.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.910
Okay fine. Just get here
as soon as you can.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.040
[Jake] Wolf's meeting us upstairs.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.710
Good. Wolf. You two.
You head upstairs.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.670
We better split up.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.050
- Upstairs?
- Go!

25:14.090 --> 25:16.140
[Wolf] Come on Jimmy. You
cut through the gallery.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.360
So you're her, eh?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.650
This is priceless.

25:35.990 --> 25:36.990
Hi.

25:41.870 --> 25:43.580
Where's the Newfoundland
Currency Collection?

25:43.620 --> 25:44.710
And if you had it already,

25:44.750 --> 25:46.000
why did you break
into the Rooms again?

25:46.620 --> 25:47.250
Now don't be shy.

25:48.830 --> 25:50.670
It's not the first time we've
been in a room together Jim.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.210
You just didn't know it.

25:54.630 --> 25:57.590
Ahem. Sergeant Bennett
asked you a question.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.970
I haven't stolen anything.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.430
I planned to steal it.

26:01.470 --> 26:02.850
But Angus got there first.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.480
So I must be losing my touch.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.060
Is that why you ended up
at the art gallery?

26:06.100 --> 26:07.270
See what I'm thinking is,

26:07.310 --> 26:08.400
is Angus cut
you out of your deal.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.060
So you have to score
something bigger.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.690
Why Jim? Do you have
something bigger for me?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.700
Okay.
Cold showers all around.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.410
We know Angus doesn't have
the currency collection.

26:22.950 --> 26:23.990
We also know

26:24.040 --> 26:25.660
that you purposely led us to him

26:25.700 --> 26:27.960
by planting the crate
in his hotel room.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.630
Not to mention the fact
that you've been leaving clues

26:29.670 --> 26:30.630
for us every of the way.

26:30.670 --> 26:31.920
Now why would you do that?

26:31.960 --> 26:34.760
Why would you believe anything
Angus has to say?

26:34.800 --> 26:35.970
Where is he anyway?

26:36.010 --> 26:38.090
He slipped away.
But we'll catch him soon.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.510
Just like we caught you.

26:39.550 --> 26:41.350
I guess we'll never know
the truth then.

26:41.390 --> 26:43.720
Can I have a minute?

26:43.760 --> 26:45.560
To talk with Natalie alone?

26:49.310 --> 26:50.270
Sure.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.730
This is nice.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.530
I can't believe
I finally caught you.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.280
After ten long years

26:58.320 --> 26:59.780
of coming so close.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.000
There were times I could
actually smell that perfume.

27:05.830 --> 27:07.290
In Algeria.

27:07.330 --> 27:08.210
Yeah.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.840
I followed you to that village.

27:14.210 --> 27:17.010
And when night came,
I fell asleep in that barn.

27:18.420 --> 27:20.640
And that whole night I was
asleep in that same barn.

27:20.680 --> 27:20.970
And you had no idea.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.470
Not until the next day
when I found your note.

27:24.930 --> 27:25.810
Yup.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.610
What's that old cliché?

27:35.820 --> 27:39.990
Maybe in another life,
we'd have a chance.

27:55.960 --> 27:56.380
What's this?

27:57.920 --> 28:00.720
It's where you'll find Angus
and the currency collection.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.390
I promise.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.600
For old time's sake.

28:10.180 --> 28:10.890
What's wrong?

28:12.390 --> 28:14.400
Are you still messed up
with this whole family thing?

28:14.440 --> 28:17.520
It's my dad.
He's wanting to see me.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.860
And we haven't exactly been
close the last while.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.280
Wanna talk about it?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.820
We had a falling out
a long time ago.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.160
A bunch of issues
I'd rather not get into.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.500
Look. If you want my advice.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.960
If there's an issue.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.170
And you feel like there's
a way that you can deal with it.

28:35.210 --> 28:35.840
You only got one father.

28:37.210 --> 28:40.130
You might want to settle
this before it's too late.

28:40.630 --> 28:41.840
Thanks.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.970
I'd better track
down that felon you lost.

28:47.390 --> 28:49.180
You're playing nice with her.
What do you have?

28:49.220 --> 28:51.810
I found this. In Angus's
hotel room

28:51.850 --> 28:52.230
in his suitcase.

28:53.520 --> 28:56.110
Money transferred in an overseas
account to an

28:56.150 --> 28:57.480
SVG Inc.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.690
Someone's being paid off.
And who the hell is SVG?

29:00.730 --> 29:03.610
Shane Vincent Garrett.
The initials he used on a card

29:03.650 --> 29:05.280
attached to a dress
that he gave to Rose.

29:05.320 --> 29:09.080
Wait a minute. Garrett
bought your wife a dress?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.240
What color was it?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.330
Don't even be at it!
I'm not in the mood.

29:12.370 --> 29:14.370
What do you think the connection
between Angus and Garrett is?

29:14.420 --> 29:15.370
I don't know.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.130
But I plan to find out.

29:17.750 --> 29:21.670
Let's go. Constable? Make sure
you watch Natalie like a Hawk.

29:21.710 --> 29:22.670
Will do.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.680
Thanks Monica.

29:25.470 --> 29:26.590
Man, she really
doesn't like you.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.100
You sure you haven't dated?

29:31.970 --> 29:33.350
[Des] So it's totally unfair.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.190
I do, like, one fourth
of the work.

29:35.230 --> 29:37.020
And I get like
one fifth of the pay.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.110
I mean, what's up with that?

29:38.150 --> 29:39.610
I'm just enjoying
the steady paycheck.

29:39.650 --> 29:41.190
Well, at least
I make more than you do.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.030
Well, at least I get paid
more than you do.

29:46.450 --> 29:46.570
Okay.

29:47.570 --> 29:51.950
Tell me
if you make more than...

29:53.450 --> 29:54.870
...this?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.080
You're kidding, right?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.210
My God yes!

29:58.250 --> 29:59.710
Des, I think I'll post
this on-line.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.040
The people need to know.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.670
No! No. No no no. Gimme that.
Give me that back.

30:03.710 --> 30:04.920
Give me.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.600
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Love Birds.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.020
Not interrupting nothing, am I?

30:13.060 --> 30:15.270
Uh, no. Maybe. Yes?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.810
- No.
- No? No.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.440
Good. My buddy at the RCMP dug
something up that might help us.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.110
- What is it?
- Newspaper clippings.

30:22.150 --> 30:24.740
And I think these will
help connect your little dots.

30:24.780 --> 30:27.950
Okay. Okay.
That's-- I'll keep that.

30:32.370 --> 30:33.700
It's an absolute mess.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.080
I've gotta cancel
any remaining ANZAC events.

30:38.710 --> 30:41.460
And I can kiss any political
aspirations back home good-bye.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.090
You know what.

30:44.130 --> 30:45.670
It's gonna be okay.

30:45.720 --> 30:45.920
I believe you.

30:47.090 --> 30:50.550
You know, I feel
a real connection here.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.470
Um...
No! Hey!

30:54.520 --> 30:55.770
Let's not fight this.

30:57.930 --> 31:00.310
Garrett, I would rather not have
to throw you through that bar.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.650
Rose.
Please.

31:04.570 --> 31:05.530
I'm in love with you.

31:05.570 --> 31:06.490
Mal!

31:07.190 --> 31:08.360
Malaki.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.410
[punch]

31:09.450 --> 31:13.160
Key. Mal. Ah. Key.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.450
Honey.
He is so not worth it.

31:16.000 --> 31:16.960
She's right.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.120
I'm sorry.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.870
What's your connection
to Angus Farriss?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.590
We know you've been taking money
from his boss back in Australia.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.130
I've done something
I'm not proud of.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.010
But now my life's in danger.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.340
I need protection.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.890
If it helps, Rose came on to me.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.760
Hey! Oh!

31:34.800 --> 31:38.180
The last thing we need is an
international incident, okay?

31:38.230 --> 31:41.060
Besides, we need Garrett.
He's key to all of this.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.020
Okay. We'll do it your way.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.020
Okay.

31:49.150 --> 31:49.450
[Monica]
Hey.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.910
You'd better wake up in a hurry.

31:52.570 --> 31:52.910
I have a migraine.

31:54.530 --> 31:57.620
That light coming in from that
window is not helping matters.

32:09.510 --> 32:10.840
Man.
I tell you right now.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.430
This is starting to feel
like a wild goose chase.

32:12.470 --> 32:14.430
Oh no. She wasn't lying, Jake.

32:14.470 --> 32:16.560
Besides, what does she have
to gain by turning in Angus?

32:16.600 --> 32:17.810
She's in jail.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.770
That's a good point, actually.

32:20.810 --> 32:21.890
- I'll think about it.
- [ring]

32:21.940 --> 32:23.350
Yeah.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.650
Garrett's on the run. He
believes his life is in danger.

32:25.690 --> 32:26.980
- From Angus?
- Yeah.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.610
The lead Natalie
gave Jimmy is bogus.

32:28.650 --> 32:28.940
There's no sign of Garrett.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.200
Alright Jimmy, we're getting
the hell outta here.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.960
This is your jugular and I can
slice it open with one move.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.250
Okay.
Just take it easy.

32:49.210 --> 32:51.550
You're not gonna like
what happens next.

32:57.390 --> 32:59.430
What the hell happened?

33:00.730 --> 33:02.390
Mmmh!

33:14.030 --> 33:15.110
Monica Hayward let Natalie
get the best of her.

33:16.740 --> 33:19.990
She took Hayward's clothes, gun,
and escaped out the front door.

33:20.040 --> 33:20.950
Her clothes?

33:21.950 --> 33:23.000
Does that mean that Monica's

33:23.040 --> 33:24.330
running around
here naked somewhere?

33:24.370 --> 33:24.830
- Jake.
- Not that I care.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.920
I have to admit, although
I'm really pissed about this --

33:28.960 --> 33:30.670
You're actually impressed
with her, aren't you?

33:30.710 --> 33:32.460
Buddy,
if you caught her for real,

33:32.510 --> 33:34.180
you wouldn't be able to keep
chasing her, now would you?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.050
Maybe.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.970
But we have to find her

33:37.010 --> 33:38.300
before she leaves town
with that currency.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.310
Or strikes again.
I got a text from Des.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.310
He says it's urgent.
Maybe he's got a lead.

33:44.770 --> 33:47.440
[Des] Okay, I'm trying to
see if I can find a pattern

33:47.480 --> 33:49.190
in regards to Natalie's
previous heists.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.320
I.e. that is,
a correlation

33:51.360 --> 33:54.400
between what she stole and how
she went about stealing it.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.240
I got my hands on these
newspaper headlines.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.490
From a bunch of cities the day
after each art theft.

33:59.530 --> 34:00.580
Look at this.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.040
There's been
a death of a key figure

34:02.080 --> 34:04.540
the same time as the heist on
three separate occasions.

34:04.580 --> 34:05.790
[Mal]
That's quite a coincidence.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.290
Even for a city bigger
than our own.

34:07.330 --> 34:09.040
Actually, with each robbery,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.880
some pretty infamous
dude was killed.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.460
It's a bit much for just
a coincidence.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.420
What? Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

34:14.460 --> 34:16.170
- Oh boy.
- She killed them all?

34:16.220 --> 34:17.800
She must have been using
the robberies as an

34:17.840 --> 34:19.970
elaborate smoke screen
to carry out her real job.

34:20.010 --> 34:20.970
She's a cleaner.

34:21.010 --> 34:23.640
Her targets were bad,
bad men.

34:23.680 --> 34:24.680
[Wolf]
Murderers.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.940
Those involved
in organized crime.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.560
No women. No Kids.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.730
And no one that didn't have a
record that didn't involve some

34:29.770 --> 34:30.980
pretty bad stuff.

34:31.020 --> 34:34.030
Okay, so she's here
to kill Garrett. But why?

34:34.070 --> 34:35.530
Maybe he was flirting
with her wife. What?

34:35.570 --> 34:36.700
Hey b'y?

34:38.320 --> 34:39.620
It would have been funnier
if Jake said that.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.530
- I am an idiot.
- Pretty much.

34:41.570 --> 34:44.040
No Jimmy. There's no way you
gotta wear this, alright?

34:44.080 --> 34:45.750
She's the best I've ever seen.
You couldn't have known.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.880
But we gotta get to Garrett
before Natalie does.

34:49.330 --> 34:49.460
Thanks.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.500
You know what?
You're right.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.630
If we find Garrett,
we'll find Natalie.

34:53.590 --> 34:55.210
He's scared and he's in hiding.

34:56.670 --> 34:59.430
But I think there's one person
who he'll respond to.

34:59.470 --> 35:01.800
Someone, who's having
a change of heart.

35:01.850 --> 35:02.930
And now wants to be with him.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.180
You really think
this is gonna work.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.810
[Jake] Whoever hired
Natalie to kill Garrett

35:05.850 --> 35:06.600
likely hired Angus too.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.400
- [ding]
- Oh my god, it worked.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.230
Garrett wants me to
meet him at the Rooms.

35:12.270 --> 35:13.820
He wants me to meet him there.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.440
And then something else he said
I can't repeat.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.820
And there's a winky face.

35:16.860 --> 35:19.160
Never underestimate the power
you have over men.

35:20.030 --> 35:20.990
Des.

35:22.030 --> 35:23.660
Good work.
What do you think?

35:23.700 --> 35:25.660
- Yeah.
- You got the raise.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.160
Wicked.
I knew it! Deadly.

35:28.620 --> 35:29.750
Gross, by.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.130
You can't see that.
Clear. Clear. Clear.

35:36.460 --> 35:37.340
Garrett?

35:45.810 --> 35:49.270
Yeah. Could we get an ambulance
over at The Rooms please?

35:49.310 --> 35:50.060
Right away?

35:50.940 --> 35:52.270
Is that what I think it is?

36:02.530 --> 36:03.780
Garrett's in stable condition.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.620
Looks like
she missed her chance.

36:07.580 --> 36:10.000
Now that's not something
she's known to do, is it?

36:10.040 --> 36:13.120
We've intensified our search.
This is now attempted murder.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.790
And from what you've told me.
Several accounts

36:14.840 --> 36:16.550
of murder in other countries.

36:18.460 --> 36:21.130
Jimmy. Buddy. Come on.
Think about it.

36:21.170 --> 36:23.260
You know this girl
better than anyone.

36:23.300 --> 36:25.850
It's your chance to catch
Natalie. Where is she headed?

36:25.890 --> 36:28.100
I don't know Jake.
I thought I knew her.

36:28.140 --> 36:29.640
Turns out she's a killer.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.940
She left the currency
and a note just to taunt me.

36:31.980 --> 36:33.770
Okay. What does the note say?

36:34.900 --> 36:37.110
Jimmy.
It's been fun.

36:37.150 --> 36:38.980
But this will be
our last encounter.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.190
That's why I gave you back
the currency collection.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.530
Unfortunately,
you now know what I am.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.120
And we'll always have Algeria.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.240
This is your shot
at redemption here.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.370
Okay, don't let your
broken ego get in the way.

36:51.750 --> 36:55.170
Think. How is she gonna escape?
Come on, Jimmy.

37:01.630 --> 37:02.680
[Jimmy]
Algeria.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.560
She left me a clue.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.930
She left me a clue.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.770
The sailboat.
Algeria.

37:11.810 --> 37:12.810
What?

37:12.850 --> 37:14.520
I know how
she's planning to escape.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.560
Let's bring her in.

37:31.870 --> 37:32.950
I should probably thank you

37:33.000 --> 37:34.620
for returning
the currency collection.

37:34.670 --> 37:35.790
But I have to ask.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.590
Why did you leave me this?

37:39.630 --> 37:41.010
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.260
This is the exact way
that you escaped in Algeria.

37:45.380 --> 37:48.220
Really, Jimmy?
So, how did I escape?

37:48.260 --> 37:51.180
You rented a fishing boat.
And you sailed to Malta.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.730
Then to Rome.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.480
And then you were a ghost.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.360
How I wanted you to find me.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.770
I left you that clue

38:00.820 --> 38:03.860
so we would be right here,
right now together.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.150
What do you mean?

38:06.200 --> 38:07.740
I want you to come with me.

38:12.870 --> 38:14.410
An art thief
is one thing, Natalie.

38:14.450 --> 38:16.580
But a murderer is another.
You're a killer.

38:17.580 --> 38:19.130
I was a killer.
But that's over.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.670
But you're here to kill Garrett.

38:21.710 --> 38:23.170
I didn't kill him, did I?

38:23.210 --> 38:24.550
Garrett's a jerk,
but he didn't deserve to die.

38:25.670 --> 38:26.970
The guy who hired me
wanted him dead

38:27.010 --> 38:28.890
because he screwed up
on a kick-back deal.

38:28.930 --> 38:30.640
That's not reason enough
to kill a man.

38:31.930 --> 38:33.890
There's no good enough
reason to kill a man.

38:36.480 --> 38:36.730
You might be right.

38:37.850 --> 38:40.310
That's why I'm done
with that life.

38:41.690 --> 38:42.690
I'm sorry.

38:44.190 --> 38:45.400
[Jake]
Natalie.

38:47.570 --> 38:50.410
Unfortunately, no one's gonna
be sailing anywhere tonight.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.740
You had a good run, Natalie,
but it's over.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.260
Well Jimmy, I'm sorry.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.800
I should buy you a drink.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.930
Yes b'y,
I could use five or ten.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.510
Please don't say "b'y."

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
What?
I thought I said it good.

39:16.770 --> 39:18.560
Only Newfoundlanders
can really say "b'y."

39:19.600 --> 39:21.360
Mainlanders just
can't pull it off.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.070
Oh. What's this?

39:33.660 --> 39:35.700
Oh Mal, they're gorgeous.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.790
Is it a coincidence they match
the dress Garrett gave me?

39:40.830 --> 39:42.170
Be a shame not to see you
in that dress.

39:43.460 --> 39:46.510
Dinner tonight,
and then some, uh, dancing.

39:48.170 --> 39:51.050
You're on. And maybe we'll
come home for dessert.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.390
Ooh?

40:12.070 --> 40:13.530
Working late?
That's impressive.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.540
You know you have
all the right tools to be

40:16.580 --> 40:17.910
a great RNC Officer?

40:17.950 --> 40:20.460
Just let me know if there is
anything that I can do

40:20.500 --> 40:22.370
to give you a boost
in the right direction.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.050
I appreciate that.
But I'm good for now. Thanks.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.840
Uh, Katrina?

40:29.130 --> 40:30.800
I was just wondering
about your uncle Jake?

40:32.130 --> 40:35.680
Oh, he's not officially
seeing anyone right now,

40:35.720 --> 40:37.390
but that window is closing fast.

40:37.430 --> 40:39.520
Oh God no.
Jake is a train wreck.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.310
I was just wondering if you
could keep me posted on

40:43.350 --> 40:45.230
some of the cases
that he's working on.

40:45.270 --> 40:47.770
Especially those involving other
RNC officers

40:47.820 --> 40:49.240
like Leslie Bennett.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.150
You want me to spy on my family?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.530
No, it's not like that.

40:56.160 --> 40:59.160
It just there are some nasty
rumors going around about Jake.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.870
And I want you to know
that I have his back.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.290
But I need to know
what he's involved in,

41:05.330 --> 41:06.840
in order to protect him.

41:16.220 --> 41:17.850
Jimmy, I know what it's like,

41:17.890 --> 41:19.060
You know,
to be in love with someone

41:19.100 --> 41:20.720
that you can't actually be with.

41:20.770 --> 41:21.480
So...

41:22.810 --> 41:25.190
I'm pretty sure your love isn't
a mass murderer.

41:25.230 --> 41:26.400
But thanks for the sentiment.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.150
[Des]
Hey. So...

41:28.190 --> 41:30.070
In celebration
of my new raise,

41:30.110 --> 41:32.570
I'd like to offer to buy you
both a half pint

41:33.110 --> 41:34.900
each, on me,

41:34.950 --> 41:37.660
with...Jake do you think I can
get an advance on my raise?

41:38.120 --> 41:38.990
Nope.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.160
It's been a pleasure, Jimmy.

41:44.830 --> 41:44.960
Back at you, Jake.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.630
Drinking again b'ys.
Hard old life, you got.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.130
We gotta go. Boss needs us.
Big job coming.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.170
And me with an extra pint.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.720
Sin to waste it, I s'pose. Just
the one, though, Jimmy, hey?

41:57.760 --> 41:59.220
- Yup, you bet.
- You knows it.

42:00.390 --> 42:02.020
[phone buzzes]

42:19.120 --> 42:20.280
There you go.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.080
No sugar, three cream, right?

42:22.700 --> 42:24.040
Yes, thank you.

42:28.210 --> 42:29.920
It's great to see you, Leslie.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.170
You too, Dad.
