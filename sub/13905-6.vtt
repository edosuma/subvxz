16:57.640 --> 16:59.600
Thank you.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.360
Ow.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.560
Well, I think he'll be back.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.800
You have an impressive pelvic
thrust.

17:18.835 --> 17:21.165
Oh.
And firm breasts.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.319
Some of those moves you were pulling
in there...

17:24.355 --> 17:26.280
you're not bad.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.520
The truth is
I had heard you were good.

17:29.555 --> 17:31.520
Your reputation precedes you.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.800
I suppose we should have just...

17:36.880 --> 17:38.940
..sorted this out in the beginning.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.965
Instead of letting things drag on.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.040
Speaking of which, there's a human
rights lawyer shackled to my boiler.

17:45.075 --> 17:47.160
I suppose I should go
and release him.

17:47.195 --> 17:49.160
Exactly.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.240
Oh, you... OK.

17:52.275 --> 17:54.245
Sorry.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.285
Yeah, I'm sure, I mean...

17:56.320 --> 17:58.280
I should probably get home, too.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.645
Hi, Ben, I'm home.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.405
Hello, my girlfriend.
Welcome back to England.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.960
Oh, Ben, I've missed you so terribly.
I'm so glad to be back.

18:14.995 --> 18:17.005
Really? Have you?

18:17.040 --> 18:20.680
That's odd. Cos it actually looked
like you got back this morning

18:20.715 --> 18:22.965
and instead of crawling into bed with
me,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
you apparently went to shag some
strangers instead.

18:26.035 --> 18:28.965
Are you enjoying yourself?
What the fuck's going on?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.720
Where the fuck have you been?
Really, the moral high ground, Ben?

18:32.755 --> 18:34.845
I did come home this morning
intending

18:34.880 --> 18:37.285
to crawl into bed with you, only,
what do I find?

18:37.320 --> 18:40.240
What are you talking about?
Who's this sleeping in my bed?

18:40.275 --> 18:42.645
Not fucking Goldilocks.
Christ, Hannah!

18:42.680 --> 18:45.440
Christ, Hannah, exactly.
Do you want me to explain? No!

18:45.475 --> 18:47.725
She got in without me knowing.
Fuck off.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.660
It's amazing. I mean...
Ben, if you're gonna lie to me

18:50.695 --> 18:53.560
at least do me the courtesy of
making it a good one.

18:53.595 --> 18:55.565
I am not fucking lying.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.660
She literally got into my bed.

18:57.695 --> 18:59.685
I woke up and told her to get out.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.440
What's going on?
Poppy, tell her. Tell her what?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.485
Don't fuck around, Poppy. Tell her.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.840
I don't want to hear it. You two can
do whatever the fuck it is you like.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.840
Poppy!
What? I don't...

19:09.875 --> 19:11.800
I just...

19:13.600 --> 19:15.600
I'm sorry.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.605
Ben didn't do anything.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.440
I just... I got in and I got out.

19:21.475 --> 19:23.485
Poppy, you can't do that!

19:23.520 --> 19:25.640
I know. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

19:25.675 --> 19:27.645
This is my house!

19:27.680 --> 19:29.640
This is my life! You can't just...

19:31.720 --> 19:33.765
Um...

19:33.800 --> 19:36.640
I think maybe you should go back to
your mum's.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.160
And no more skeletons
hiding in the closet.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.045
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.360
Well, come on, you can see how I
might have got the wrong idea.

19:53.395 --> 19:56.005
Well, yeah, fine.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.240
If you hadn't just pissed off, as
always.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.500
Not ignored what's going wrong here.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.600
Ben, I'm just...
And do you know what?

20:04.720 --> 20:08.600
Actually, forgive me if I don't find
this all slightly hypocritical,

20:08.635 --> 20:10.697
me lying in bed with someone else.

20:10.732 --> 20:12.760
Given what you do every single day...

20:12.795 --> 20:14.817
Ben, I know. I'm sorry.

20:14.852 --> 20:16.840
I am. I'm sorry, I mean it.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.880
I just... I'm...

20:18.915 --> 20:20.885
I was...

20:20.920 --> 20:22.925
I was just fragile

20:22.960 --> 20:24.960
and I was angry and I just...

20:26.400 --> 20:30.240
I just wanted to be Belle for a bit
and not Hannah.

20:30.275 --> 20:32.645
Oh, my god,
when are you gonna get it?

20:32.680 --> 20:35.880
There is no Belle and
there is no Hannah. There's just you.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.400
It's just you who won't stop fucking
this up.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.605
It's just you

20:43.640 --> 20:46.340
who doesn't know what you want.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.005
And I am getting so sick and tired

20:49.040 --> 20:51.640
of waiting around to find out if it's
gonna be me.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.520
Oh, my god.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.080
♪ Keep my love as light as a
feather...

21:16.240 --> 21:19.240
I've got a client.
He likes roleplay, very specific.

21:19.275 --> 21:21.240

21:24.600 --> 21:26.640
You're not angry?

21:26.675 --> 21:28.080
No.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.600
Some people make you care
whether you want to or not.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.600
