00:25.193 --> 00:27.128
Ah, do you smell that?

00:27.161 --> 00:30.464
Oh,
what an intoxicating aroma.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.332
Mmm...

00:31.365 --> 00:34.435
Oh, man!
It's making my nose hungry.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.139
Where is that smell
coming from?

00:38.172 --> 00:39.673
Let's find out!

00:45.313 --> 00:47.348
RAVEN:
It's coming from under there.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.651
Hey! What are you doing?

00:50.684 --> 00:54.388
We have come here in search
of the smell of the gods.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.191
You must be talking about
the new, new car smell.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.660
You like that, huh? Bladow!

01:14.342 --> 01:17.211
Yeah, I've been tinkering,
tweaking and straight up

01:17.245 --> 01:19.413
improverating everything
on the T-car.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.682
The engine's purring
like a kitten. Meow.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.219
The suspension is springy
like fresh baked bread.
Delicious!

01:25.253 --> 01:28.456
The steering now handles
like a car. Honk, honk!

01:28.489 --> 01:30.124
There's only so much
you can do with steering.

01:30.158 --> 01:33.727
This is why you are
my best friend
and only true confidant.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.598
You act as if you hold
more affection for the vehicle
than for us, Cyborg.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.601
I do! You guys are garbage
compared to my baby.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.736
And I love you guys.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.373
Aw, he said he loved us.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.175
He also called us garbage.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.542
You have to understand,

01:48.576 --> 01:51.179
I found this car
when it was just a baby.

01:51.212 --> 01:55.683
He had fallen out of his nest
and I knew he couldn't fend
for himself, so I took him in,

01:55.716 --> 01:58.819
taught him karate,
Spanish and most importantly,

01:58.852 --> 02:00.621
how to be a man.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.722
Hola, coche.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.524
None of that
was true, Starfire.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.559
But it feels true,
which makes it true.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.728
I wish you guys
could love this car
the way I love him.

02:07.761 --> 02:11.632
Oh, I know what we're doing...
Road Trip!

02:12.833 --> 02:15.869
Come on!
A road trip is the most
fun thing in the world.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.171
We'll bring snacks...

02:17.205 --> 02:19.173
Snacks

02:19.207 --> 02:20.508
Road Trip!

02:20.541 --> 02:22.276
We'll bond as team mates
and learn life lessons

02:22.310 --> 02:24.245
we'll never learn
cooped up in not-a-car.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.446
Team bonding!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.681
Road Trip!

02:27.715 --> 02:29.250
But where shall we go?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.252
CYBORG: From Point A
to Point B.

02:31.285 --> 02:34.488
But it's not the destination
that matters,
it's the journey.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.457
Ooh, a magical journey?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.192
Abracadabra, darling!

02:38.226 --> 02:39.827
Whoo-hoo! Road trip!

02:41.929 --> 02:43.331
Can I keep reading my book?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.798
You might get car sick,
but sure.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.700
Whoo-hoo. Road trip.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.538
Whoo-hoo! Road trip!

02:50.571 --> 02:54.742
By the end of this trip,
you guys are going to
love this car as much as I do.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.287
Uh-oh, the HIVE!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.322
And it looks like
they're stealing!

03:08.356 --> 03:10.458
All right!
They're in for a road trip!

03:23.504 --> 03:26.474
-Oh, yeah!
That was awesome!

03:26.507 --> 03:28.442
-It was all right.
-I do not know why we are

03:28.476 --> 03:30.978
cheering such
deplorable behavior.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.480
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

03:32.513 --> 03:34.882
I love road trips!

03:42.290 --> 03:44.258
You guys having fun?

03:44.292 --> 03:46.360
No, we're out of snacks.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.262
There's been
zero team bonding.

03:48.296 --> 03:52.500
I have not seen one fairy
or the wizard
on this magical journey.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.968
And I'm starting
to get car sick.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.937
Then stop reading in the car!

03:59.473 --> 04:02.343
Look, every road trip
can get a little dull

04:02.376 --> 04:04.345
and that's what
road games are for.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.680
No, I learned
a long time ago

04:06.714 --> 04:09.049
not to play the road games.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.885
Do you want the ball?
Do you want the ball?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.654
Then go get it!

04:18.959 --> 04:20.761
Not those kinds
of road games, Star.

04:20.794 --> 04:24.632
I know, let's play Slug Bug.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.801
All right, you got me.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.504
Beast Boy,
why would you do such a thing?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.606
It's part of the game, Star.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.344
Any time you see a bug go by,
you yell "Slug Bug" and punch
someone in the arm.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.545
I understand.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.749
-Slug Bug!
-Ow!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.753
I see another insect, oh!

04:45.786 --> 04:47.988
No, you don't understand.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.525
Slug Bug! Slug Bug!

04:51.559 --> 04:53.927
That's the wrong
kind of bug! We meant...

04:53.961 --> 04:57.565
Slug Bug! Slug Bug!
Slug Bug! Slug Bug! Slug Bug!

04:58.699 --> 05:00.534
What a delightful game.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.035
That was fun.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.540
Please, let's play,
"I Spy" instead.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.510
-I spy with my little...
-Another insect.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.944
-Slug Bug!

05:10.978 --> 05:13.581
Oh, yeah, now it's starting
to feel like a road trip.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.483
Look, the HIVE again.

05:15.516 --> 05:19.953
Come on, guys,
let's help 'em out,
after all, we are superheroes.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.794
Hey, Gizmo, you need a ride
to the mechanic?

05:26.827 --> 05:30.130
Uh, sure, that's awfully nice
of you guys.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.499
Cool, hop in.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.701
-Hey!

05:33.734 --> 05:36.937
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
My foot slipped.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.806
-Okay.

05:38.839 --> 05:43.377
Oops, sorry about that.
Hop on in.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.045
-Come on!

05:45.078 --> 05:48.115
Okay, okay, for real
this time, jump in.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.486
No, I'm serious,
I'm going to stop this time.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.588
I'm going to stop this time.
Come on, come on, come on.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.727
I love road trips again!

06:00.628 --> 06:02.730
I'm bored again!

06:02.763 --> 06:04.932
Bored? What about
all that fun we had?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.535
Perhaps we are not
the vehicle people.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.136
Yeah, can we go back
to the Tower?

06:09.169 --> 06:13.006
No, we are traveling
to Point B.
Now have some car fun.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.413
-Uh-oh, look out,
that's my jam!

06:19.447 --> 06:20.881
Nuh-uh, we're not doing that.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.750
-Hey, I was listening to that.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.885
Nobody wants to see
your groove on.
Take your groove off!

06:26.787 --> 06:29.022
Oh, so you get to control
the radio!
What's up with that, man?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.158
I was about to get
my groove on.
You see my cape flying there.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.960
CYBORG: Get your cape
out of my face!
I'm trying to see the road!

06:34.061 --> 06:36.029
Slug Bug!

06:36.063 --> 06:40.133
Why are there
so many bugs in this car?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.769
Well, I warned you.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.710
That's it!
Do you want me
to stop this car?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.513
Do you?
Do you want to walk home?

06:52.546 --> 06:55.115
You really gonna walk?
But that was just
an empty threat.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.150
Sorry, but we're done
with the road trip.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.186
I never want to get
in that car again.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.822
Enjoy the rest
of your non-magical journey.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.791
Let's just go home.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.127
Well, you guys are gonna
miss out on the best part
of the road trip!

07:07.160 --> 07:09.697
Hours 12 through 16!

07:12.666 --> 07:13.834
Who needs those guys?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.804
I'll get to Point B
all by myself.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.206
Slug Bug! Ow!

07:19.239 --> 07:22.710
I know,
I spy with my little eye...

07:22.743 --> 07:26.780
A terribly handsome dude
who's not having
a good road trip.

07:39.660 --> 07:44.064
Hey guys, I've got four comfy
air-conditioned seats here
with your names on them.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.833
-Nah.
-We are happy perambulating.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.900
I'd rather crawl.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.769
Come on, I'll drive you home.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.838
No need, we're doing great.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.507
Look, I'm sorry
I cooped you up in this car.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.809
I just wanted you to love it
as much as I do.

08:02.716 --> 08:07.621
Hmm, that car looks
like it's driving
on the wrong side of the road.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.857
-ROBIN: It's the HIVE!
-And they look angry.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.892
-Get us out of here!
-Go, go, go!

08:20.734 --> 08:22.936
We're going to have to work
together to get out
of this one.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.038
That sounds like team bonding!

08:26.807 --> 08:28.942
You want to see
some magic, Star?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.046
Abracadabra!

08:39.587 --> 08:40.621
They're still on us!

08:53.634 --> 08:55.202
Engage auto pilot!

09:10.317 --> 09:12.319
I'm going to need an
assist here, Beastie!

09:12.352 --> 09:13.420
Well...

09:13.453 --> 09:16.624
I'm not sure if I have
the strength to fight them.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.758
Booyah!

09:17.791 --> 09:18.992
Snacks!

09:20.360 --> 09:21.695
-Let's do this!

09:42.115 --> 09:43.350
Nothing's working!

09:43.383 --> 09:44.918
What can I do?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.354
Just keep reading!

09:47.387 --> 09:48.588
Cool.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.293
Oh.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.298
Out the window!
Out the window!

10:07.107 --> 10:09.242
-Oh, yes!
-Yay! Awesome!

10:09.276 --> 10:10.811
-Whoo-hoo, sweet!

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
Oh, yeah, that was cool.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.882
Even if we didn't make it
to our destination,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.350
your road trip was pretty fun.

10:17.384 --> 10:21.154
Wait this is it!
This is Point B! We made it!

10:21.188 --> 10:24.057
It's just more road.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.860
I told you, it's not about
the destination,

10:26.894 --> 10:27.995
it's about the journey.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.096
Whatever.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.398
The important thing is,
it's over.

10:31.431 --> 10:35.268
Half over!
Now we got to go from Point B
back to Point A.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.270
That's the best part!
Road trip!

10:37.304 --> 10:39.873
Yeah, we're never
doing that again.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.108
STARFIRE: We live here now.
