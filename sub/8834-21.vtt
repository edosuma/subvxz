[Kit] This doesn't make sense.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.500

That's what Wiley said

There's something weird
going on out there.

It was like being pulled up
into the ocean.

Ooh. I love what you've
done with this place.

Ah. And here is the world's

Mr. Cloudkicker.

02:38.542 --> 02:39.917
What's going on?

02:40.125 --> 02:42.542
We are stealing your cargo.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.083
We are pirates.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.041
It's what we do.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.041
I mean the horizon.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.583
Oh, that. See for yourself.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.917
How do you like that?

02:54.333 --> 02:56.500
[Baloo] It's all done with mirrors.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.375
How'd you build them so big?

02:58.458 --> 03:00.458
Don't be absurd.

03:00.625 --> 03:04.542
We did not build them.
We stole them.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.542
[Don Karnage] Aah! The bright flash!

03:08.250 --> 03:12.500
So that's what happened
to Khan's other pilots.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.792
Khan? Wait, I see it all now.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.500
Khan was tired of losing his planes,

03:18.792 --> 03:20.625
so he sent you.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.750
Easy. Not around the kid.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.917
So, where's his cargo?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.750
Uh, what cargo?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.667
Found it, boss.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.166
Shall we have a look-see?

03:33.375 --> 03:36.083
No! Khan entrusted that painting to me.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.625

03:41.166 --> 03:43.208
What is it?

03:43.542 --> 03:46.875

-It is a homing device.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.750
No painting?

03:48.834 --> 03:51.417
Not even a signature.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.625
You were trying
to set me up.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.583
I--I didn't know.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.208
Of course not,

03:58.291 --> 04:00.750
because Khan set you up, too.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.792
He pumped grand notions

04:02.875 --> 04:06.250
into the vast emptiness
of your head.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.291
Well, if Khan is tracking us,

04:08.375 --> 04:11.250
he'll send his biggest gunship here

04:11.333 --> 04:13.291
and blow you away.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.959
Boss, let's go.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.916
We don't stand a chance
against a gunship.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.875
In a fair fight, I agree.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.417
But think hard

04:23.542 --> 04:27.959
and suppose they're lured
into a mine field first.

04:28.458 --> 04:32.041
Kaboom! Ha ha. Like that.
Goodbye. Adios.

04:32.125 --> 04:35.208
And we owe it all to you, Baloo.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.625

Now we just have to get to the <i>Sea Duck</i>
and warn that gunship.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.166
-OK, Baloo?
-Whatever you say.

14:20.417 --> 14:24.250
Big deal. So I made a little mistake.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.458
The captain didn't have to get cranky.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.750
This ship needed washing.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.959
Baloo, hold it.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.000
Oh, great.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.542
We'll never get her riding. What now?

14:45.792 --> 14:47.834
Baloo will fly us out.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.417
Me? Ha.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.625
He's just being modest.

14:51.709 --> 14:54.375
He can fly anything, anywhere.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.000
Give it up, kid.

14:56.083 --> 15:00.291
Nobody can fly a plane full of water
and upside down.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.542
Baloo can, 'cause he's the greatest.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.458
Stop it, you hear me?

15:05.542 --> 15:07.458
Just knock it off.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.542
I'm a loser. A failure.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.166
I crashed my plane.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.959
I lost my cargo.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.583
Thanks to me, a boat's getting sunk.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.375
I can't cut it.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.500
Just-- Just leave me alone.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.125
Papa Bear?

15:26.166 --> 15:27.500
What?

15:29.041 --> 15:31.875
I still think you're the best.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.417
You really think I can do it?

15:42.667 --> 15:44.625
It's something to shoot for.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.458
This ain't no hayride.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.208
Let's pull chops.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.208
Yee-ha!

15:53.417 --> 15:55.709
Captain!

15:56.375 --> 15:57.208
Here.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.208
Breathe through this.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.333
This won't work, guys.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.875
Just prepare for takeoff.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.083
You're crazy, Baloo.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.166
[knock on door]

16:16.250 --> 16:19.375
If you brought a present, come in.

16:19.458 --> 16:22.208
Captain, the prisoners have escaped.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.291
What?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.625
Idiots. Find them.

16:25.709 --> 16:27.333
[Mad Dog] Hey, look.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.125
Moby Dick.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.291
That is the <i>Sea Duck, </i> you slugs.

16:33.417 --> 16:34.333
After them!

16:34.417 --> 16:37.000
[Kit] [distorted voice]
Go right. And speed it up.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.667
[normal voice] And...

16:39.750 --> 16:41.458
Now, Baloo! Now!

16:43.375 --> 16:44.750
You did it!

16:44.959 --> 16:45.917
He did it!

16:46.083 --> 16:47.667
I did?

16:47.750 --> 16:48.667
I did.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.709
[Kit] Yee-ha!

17:00.709 --> 17:03.291
We got to warn that gunship.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.541
Maybe if we set off a mine,

17:05.666 --> 17:07.000
they'd turn away.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.290
Aw, not my trophy.

17:10.750 --> 17:11.959
It's the only way.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.040
Been nice knowing you.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.165
Minefield dead ahead.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.916
Power to port.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.458
You saved them, Baloo.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.083
But who'll save us?

18:07.750 --> 18:10.625
Status report, Captain Hotspur.

18:10.709 --> 18:14.834
A yellow sea plane
saved us from a minefield, sir.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.583
[Shere Khan] <i>Yes.</i>

18:16.792 --> 18:19.333
<i>That would be</i>
<i>my patsy,</i>

18:19.417 --> 18:20.667
<i>Baloo.</i>

18:20.750 --> 18:23.166
Well, he's giving those pirates

18:23.250 --> 18:25.542
a run for their money.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.041
[Kit]
Baloo, head for the mirrors.

18:38.125 --> 18:41.000
Why, to see ourselves shot down?

18:41.166 --> 18:43.333
No. We'll escape between them.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.792
The pirates are flying CT-37s.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.834
They croak going up a steep climb.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.125
If we fly low,

18:53.375 --> 18:54.542
pull up between the mirrors...

18:54.625 --> 18:56.375
They can't follow.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.333
This is insanity.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.125
Stop him.

19:07.959 --> 19:09.000
That's it.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.959
We're finished.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.000
I'll be your eyes.

19:13.291 --> 19:16.625
This boy's enthusiasm will get us killed.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.667
This boy happens to be Kit Cloudkicker,

19:19.750 --> 19:22.667
the best navigator in these skies.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.166
And we're a team, see.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.875
If he thinks we can do it, we can.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.583
So do it.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.458
[Kit] A half a mile.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.792
More altitude.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.083
10 degrees port.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.667
A bit more.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.333
Dead on.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.000
400 yards.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.583
A hundred. Go!

19:50.417 --> 19:52.333
Unbelievable.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.959
Follow him.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.709
I have you now, Baloo.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.083
Maybe not.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.083
[Kit] It worked.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.667
They couldn't follow.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.250
[whirring]

20:19.083 --> 20:20.625
Going down.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.458
Well. He who steals and runs away

20:33.583 --> 20:36.375
lives to steal another day.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.125
Let's go, Scotty.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.667
Uh...

20:40.750 --> 20:42.208
The name's Jacques.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.291
[Wiley] Baloo.

20:54.417 --> 20:56.834
The best piloting I've seen.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.500
[giggles] Yeah.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.291
You were terrific.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.792
Why did you send me on that mission?

21:09.875 --> 21:11.542
I could have been killed.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.291
Pirates, guns.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.375
And what about my plane?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.875
You, you, you--

21:18.625 --> 21:19.959
[Shere Khan] I believe this

21:20.041 --> 21:23.291
should adequately show my appreciation.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.625
Uh...

21:25.709 --> 21:26.750
Yes, sir.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.417
Good day then.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.083
Hold the phone, buster.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.667
One more thing.

21:34.750 --> 21:35.792
Yes?

21:35.875 --> 21:39.250
I lost my trophy saving your gunship.

21:39.542 --> 21:42.041
I'm going to need another one.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.417
A bigger one.

21:48.083 --> 21:53.125
[laughs] And then Khan gave me the money
and this new trophy.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.709
That's wonderful.

21:54.792 --> 21:56.083
Isn't it, Kit?

21:56.166 --> 21:58.041
[Kit] Yeah. Great.

21:58.208 --> 22:00.375
Check that inscription.

22:00.917 --> 22:01.917
[sighs]

22:02.000 --> 22:02.834
Huh?

22:02.917 --> 22:04.583
"Kit Cloudkicker,

22:04.667 --> 22:07.250
best navigator in the world"?

22:07.333 --> 22:08.583
All right!

22:08.917 --> 22:12.208
Just don't let it go to your head.
