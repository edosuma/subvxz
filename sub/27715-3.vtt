20:31.034 --> 20:35.482
Well, it's, uh,
not the most original idea.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.517
But...

20:37.620 --> 20:40.620
original ideas are rarely good.

20:40.724 --> 20:42.000
Okay, let's do it.

20:42.103 --> 20:43.827
Nice work, John.
-Thank you.

20:43.931 --> 20:46.655
[ Sighs ] Say, is anyone else
hot in here?

20:46.758 --> 20:48.689
Oh, definitely.

20:48.793 --> 20:51.000
Kate, why don't you see
about turning up the AC?

20:51.103 --> 20:52.172
Yes, sir.

20:52.275 --> 20:54.586
I'm off to another
ZenCycle class.

20:54.689 --> 20:56.137
I simply cannot get enough.

20:56.241 --> 20:57.517
[ Laughs ]

20:57.620 --> 21:00.241
[ Indistinct conversations ]

21:05.517 --> 21:08.310
[ Birds chirping ]

21:09.931 --> 21:12.482
I actually have an addiction
I've never really talked about.

21:12.586 --> 21:14.344
Uh, I'm addicted
to eating earplugs.

21:14.448 --> 21:16.103
-Fascinating.
-It's weird, but you remember

21:16.206 --> 21:17.620
that woman who ate
her own couch?

21:17.724 --> 21:18.724
-Yes, we do.
-Start to finish?

21:18.827 --> 21:19.862
Well, it's a similar
kind of thing,

21:19.965 --> 21:21.586
but with silicone
earplugs.

21:21.689 --> 21:22.896
Cotton will not do it
for me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.206
Has to be silicone?Got to be silicone.
