WEBVTT

00:26.360 --> 00:28.028
I hope
the next letter’s an "L".

00:28.112 --> 00:29.780
'Cause you’re shit out of luck
if you think

00:29.864 --> 00:31.699
my brother's going to accept
your apology.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.909
The boy holds a grudge longer
than Medea.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.578
Well I’m running out of
ways to say sorry.

00:39.582 --> 00:41.083
Well, if you won’t stop begging
for yourself,

00:41.167 --> 00:42.752
then do it for me.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.086
You’re the one person
on this lake

00:44.170 --> 00:45.254
I can lowkey look up to.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.175
Thanks, Opal, I really need--

00:49.258 --> 00:50.843
I did it for all of us.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.595
You were one sorry away

00:52.678 --> 00:54.638
from standing outside
his window with a boombox.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.648
You’re up early.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.942
<i>Uh, yeah, 'cause it’s</i>
<i>Tiltapalooza!</i>

01:07.026 --> 01:08.694
<i>Who can sleep in baby?</i>

01:08.778 --> 01:10.196
<i>And you know who else</i>
<i>couldn't sleep in?</i>

01:10.279 --> 01:12.573
Oh, oh, oh, oh--
Surprise!

01:12.656 --> 01:14.658
- Surprise baby!
- <i>Hey Billie-Bear!</i>

01:14.742 --> 01:16.118
Mom?! Dad?!

01:16.202 --> 01:17.328
- Oh, oh!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.121
Oh, yeah, there's--

01:19.205 --> 01:20.873
probably just a squirrel or
raccoon or something.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.875
They caught the last guy who
was living in the walls.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.794
- The walls?
<i>- You get teenage ass</i>

01:24.877 --> 01:26.212
<i>back here with</i>
<i>your lifejacket on.</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:28.297
<i>'Cause you got parents to hug.</i>

01:34.762 --> 01:36.806
The view’s spectacular, honey.
Come see.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.308
Looks fine from here.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.976
I don’t like the look
of those railings.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.270
Oh, yeah,
the hint of imminent death

01:43.354 --> 01:45.272
is part of what gives this
place its charm.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.441
People on the lake
call it the Murder Cabin.

01:47.525 --> 01:48.943
Was someone
actually murdered here?

01:49.026 --> 01:50.361
Oh yeah; Kidnapping,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.154
cannibalism,
black market abattoir...

01:52.238 --> 01:54.323
It just needs
a little love and an exorcism.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.867
Billie and I love it so much
I actually put an offer on it

01:56.951 --> 01:59.078
but it’s conditional
so we'll see.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.121
Should have the financing
sorted by the end of day.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.706
What happened
with your family’s place?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.333
Billie said you had
your heart set on it

02:04.416 --> 02:06.377
but there was conflict with
your step-sister.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.003
Yeah, more ancient blood feud.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.880
But I think that we've
come to an agreement

02:09.964 --> 02:11.924
that’s gonna let us
bury the hatchet.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.342
Not in each other’s faces.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.718
Hi! Hi!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.182
When did you get here?

02:20.266 --> 02:22.309
Yesterday.
We took an early flight back

02:22.393 --> 02:24.854
- and drove straight up.
- We just missed you too much.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.523
Justin says we arrived
in time for Tatapalooza.

02:27.606 --> 02:31.235
- Tat-a-tat-tat.
- Tiltapalooza, yeah.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.862
But if you’re super jet-lagged

02:32.945 --> 02:35.573
we could just get breakfast
or something.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.992
Yeah, it’s the Boathouse’s
last big hurrah

02:38.075 --> 02:39.952
before the end of the year.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.829
But it’s just, like, silly
games and races and stuff.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.706
You can totally skip it.
Go to breakfast.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.875
I dunno, it sounds kinda fun.
What do you think, Naomi?

02:48.085 --> 02:49.587
Is it indoors?

02:49.670 --> 02:54.049
"Fussin'"]

02:55.259 --> 02:58.512
Long ago in Sweden farmers
would gather their herds

02:58.596 --> 03:00.598
to their pens with Kulning

03:00.681 --> 03:02.433
and shepherds would call
their flocks

03:02.516 --> 03:04.768
back from summer pastures
for the winter.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.271
Today in the same tradition
of Kulning

03:07.354 --> 03:09.648
we will celebrate
the end of summer.

03:15.446 --> 03:18.157
Let Tiltapalooza begin!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.713
- Oh!
- Yeah!

03:32.796 --> 03:35.257
So, not indoors...

03:39.887 --> 03:42.306
- Oh, my God.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.979
- Hey babe.
- Wayne, no.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.148
- I can do that for you.
- No you won't, no you don't.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.650
This is mine. Go on.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.109
- Where'd you get this?
- I hate this.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.653
Is this a rental?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.711
You can race with
Killian if you want.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.505
Nah. I’m good.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.217
Well buck up, Billie-Bear.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.595
Summer romances
aren’t meant to last.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.263
You’ll find a way
to close the chapter.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.562
No, I need a shovel.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.243
Need a partner?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.620
Yes please.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.697
This is a family event!

05:21.780 --> 05:23.449
We might need
to freshen up our repertoire.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.701
This rope-play
is getting kinda stale.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.623
Just in case you need it,
I'll help you a bit more, here.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.208
- No, you don't--
- Just to get the rest.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.710
- You don't!
- Okay, okay.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.503
- You get out!
- Just trying to help.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.644
Two Wayne burgers. Medium rare.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.938
All right.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.275
You okay there, Wayner?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.319
What am I gonna do
without my sweet baby Jayne?

06:00.402 --> 06:04.448
Yeah... Maisy and I were sorry
to hear you’re splitting up.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.575
Oh, I mean-- she said we’re
just taking a break.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.786
Ooh.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.579
Fuck.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.998
Hey, you know how
in Michael Bay movies,

06:13.082 --> 06:15.000
- Wahlberg’s always the shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.460
But then these bad robots
show up

06:16.543 --> 06:17.920
and then for a moment
he's like,

06:18.003 --> 06:19.421
"Wait a minute,
am I the shit?"

06:19.505 --> 06:21.381
But then he kicks some ass

06:21.465 --> 06:23.550
and he’s like, "I am the shit,
I'm totally the shit."

06:24.426 --> 06:26.136
I used to think
that I was a Wahlberg,

06:26.220 --> 06:27.930
now with Jaynie leaving me
I'm starting to think

06:28.013 --> 06:29.640
- maybe I’m just a sad Shia.
- Stop.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.308
- Why is she leaving me?
- Well, you day drink

06:31.391 --> 06:32.851
you don't really
take care of the kids

06:32.935 --> 06:34.186
and you're a terrible listener.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.188
- Two hot dogs. Well done.
- Exactly.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.108
When we get back to the city,

06:39.191 --> 06:41.276
I'm probably gonna have to
crash with you guys for a bit.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.903
Stop.
Listen to me very carefully.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.239
You may not be a Wahlberg,

06:45.322 --> 06:47.950
but I can help you be
the next best thing.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.451
Me.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.453
Look, you just need
a win, big guy.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.414
Once Jaynie sees you take down
a nine time Tilting champ,

06:54.498 --> 06:56.667
love will bloom
again my friend.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.586
Yeah! Dude, I'll be like
Wahlberg from <i>Boogie Nights.</i>

06:59.670 --> 07:01.296
Different kinda love, bud.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.799
Right, well without the cocaine
and all the porn.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.092
Maybe a bit of porn.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.261
- Thank you Victor!
- Ow. Yup.

07:08.470 --> 07:12.307
Jayne and Wayne
together again. Woo.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.022
- Here you go, babe.
- Oh, but I asked for a burger.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.899
Yeah, sorry.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.943
With Jayne gone rogue,
Wayne’s off his grill game.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.822
"Do ear infections
cause vertigo?"

07:28.282 --> 07:30.659
I put extra weight
in Justin’s paddle

07:30.742 --> 07:32.619
but I still need
more of an edge.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.121
Ooh,
Fear of losing is healthy.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.583
Any more Brené Brown and I
swear I’ll move in with Jayne.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.918
God, tilting is so juvenile.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.837
I should’ve banned it
when I was president.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.547
I dunno,
I think it's kinda cool.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.174
It’s a cock fight
concussion factory

07:45.257 --> 07:46.550
that could cost us our cottage.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.926
What are you talking about?

07:48.302 --> 07:49.887
Derrick changed his will

07:49.970 --> 07:51.722
and left the cottage
in a trust for Justin.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.640
Everything that we worked for
could go to Billie.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.642
And we could get lawyers
involved

07:55.726 --> 07:57.477
but that would be expensive
and probably take forever, so--

07:57.561 --> 07:59.313
Trial by tilt.
Not such a bad idea, huh?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.356
Only if I beat Justin though.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.525
Well, you always come up
with something. Usually legal.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.360
Fire in the hole!

08:07.738 --> 08:09.406
Summer of Jayne...

08:13.827 --> 08:16.622
I’m going to put in an offer
on Whoreen’s murder cabin.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.916
- We can’t afford that.
- Yes we can.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.043
Even if Justin wins
and we have to buy him out,

08:21.126 --> 08:23.295
we can use the left over money
from our renovation

08:23.378 --> 08:24.880
for a down payment...

08:25.505 --> 08:26.965
And then we buy
the murder cabin cheap.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.842
Flip it and Airbnb it.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.928
We could, like, double our
money in a couple of years.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.931
Then we ride Justin's skinny
ass off this lake. Yes.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.683
I’m gonna ride you
like a pony when we get home.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.310
Giddy up.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.613
She is a bonified
entrepren-her

08:49.696 --> 08:51.865
I'm loving
this journey for you.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.450
That means so much
coming from you.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.452
I mean, you make
everything look so easy.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.621
Kids, career-- capris!

08:57.704 --> 09:00.290
I heard about you and Wayne.
How're you doing?

09:00.374 --> 09:02.292
I feel great.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.963
I--I am so excited to explore
this woman that I'm becoming.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.799
And... and other women or...

09:08.882 --> 09:09.967
Or just one woman...

09:10.968 --> 09:15.472
Well, here is a woman standing
in front of another woman

09:15.555 --> 09:18.475
asking her to be their second.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.272
- Uh, in your tilt with Justin.
- Mm-hm.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.023
Maisy...

09:25.691 --> 09:27.567
I would be honored.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.361
I will not let you down.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.196
No, I feel like
I let you down.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.865
I got so wrapped up in Justin
trying to stop my reno

09:33.949 --> 09:36.702
that I barely noticed
that my best friend

09:36.785 --> 09:38.370
- might be getting a divorce.
- Best friend...

09:38.453 --> 09:40.205
And I've lost sight of what
is really special

09:40.289 --> 09:41.707
about the lake, you know?

09:41.790 --> 09:44.209
It's family and friends
coming together.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.128
Which is why
I need a cottage for my mom.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.422
You know, I don't know
how much time she has left.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.300
And I think that Whoreen’s
would be ideal.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.552
It's close enough,
but there's a lake inbetween.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.805
O.M. Jeepers,
this is so exciting!

09:56.888 --> 10:00.392
- You are my third offer today.
- Oh!

10:00.475 --> 10:03.603
My first listing in years
is blowing up!

10:03.687 --> 10:06.440
- Girl’s still got it!
- Oh, she sure does!

10:06.523 --> 10:08.358
There's just one little thing,
which is, um...

10:08.442 --> 10:11.570
We were hoping to get it a
titch under asking

10:11.653 --> 10:15.240
because funds are really tight
with the reno, you know?

10:16.325 --> 10:19.911
Uh, sometimes writing a letter
to the owner can help...

10:23.206 --> 10:24.958
My mom will be fine
in the bunkie.

10:25.042 --> 10:31.548
But here is another offer that
you cannot turn down.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.550
We cannot have another summer

10:33.633 --> 10:35.802
with Ulrika
as president, right?

10:35.886 --> 10:38.347
- No.
- So if you need

10:38.430 --> 10:41.308
a VP, that's me...

10:45.020 --> 10:46.605
Okay.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.398
I can make Whoreen come round.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.943
And then-- then I have so many
ideas for my presidency.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.070
- I just wanna--
- Awesome.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.572
Okay. Bye!

11:02.746 --> 11:05.457
You can step down, Brunhilda

11:05.540 --> 11:08.502
The Boathouse president
always MCs the Tilts.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.380
I think for wordplay and drama,
it’s better if I do.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.382
I don’t work with children.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.716
Neither do I.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.389
<i>- Let the Tilting begin!</i>
<i>- Let the Tilting begin!</i>

11:22.933 --> 11:26.478
Alright, first up,
a battle of champions.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.730
Both Tilters
have won nine times.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.857
Yes, Wayne’s last title
was eleven years

11:30.941 --> 11:33.944
and forty pounds ago but don’t
count that bad boy out.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.279
The "Moore with More"
could rise and take the title

11:36.363 --> 11:38.573
from Boathouse favorite,
"Vic-the-Stick".

11:38.657 --> 11:39.991
Well let’s see if he's still

11:40.075 --> 11:42.369
got the moves
on unfrozen water.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.954
<i>Hey, keep it clean.</i>

11:44.037 --> 11:45.622
<i>No head shots.</i>

11:46.456 --> 11:50.585
If you’re drowning, speak up!
We can’t read lips!

11:52.879 --> 11:54.798
Is Jaynie watching?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.634
- Yup.
- Okay.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.302
Look, you got this.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.304
Just take one swipe at my leg
and I'll dive in.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.681
Okay. You’re going down, Lin!

12:02.764 --> 12:05.851
Go Daddy! Woo!

12:05.934 --> 12:07.936
Come on, baby, you got this!

12:12.691 --> 12:14.067
Ah! Yeah!

12:14.151 --> 12:16.820
- That was gonna happen.
- Mm. Sad.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.822
That was really fast.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.869
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, it was instinct.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.455
- Thank you.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.832
Mwah, mwah!

12:32.210 --> 12:34.087
Jayne...

12:36.715 --> 12:38.842
<i>I can’t hear you drowning...</i>

12:42.637 --> 12:45.140
- Congrats, Dad.
- Thanks, son.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.225
Ten year champ.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.519
No way anyone beats
your record now.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.771
Except the reigning,
defending, Junior champ!

12:51.855 --> 12:54.107
One day you’re gonna send
my ass into the lake.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.817
And I couldn’t be prouder, son.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.069
Who am I tilting with anyway?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.324
Billie. Last minute entry.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.618
Look, she’s the only one
with the balls to take you on.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.328
But don’t let that
psych you out.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.871
Keep your core braced
and you can’t lose.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.164
I tried, I couldn’t.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.082
We’re winners, son.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.918
What about all that "losing’s
the new winning" shit?

13:13.001 --> 13:16.004
No shade to Brené
but losing is for losers.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.048
Now I gotta put
this little baby down.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.091
We're gonna take a little nap.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.303
Good, good, good. Yes.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.849
So, you try
to capsize their canoe

13:27.933 --> 13:29.809
with a giant foam
wrapped paddle?

13:29.893 --> 13:31.353
Dad said I needed closure.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.855
Okay, we told you
not to drink the tea.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.107
Don’t worry.
Tilting’s in my blood.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.277
No, that padding
is not adequate.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.445
I'm gonna get you
another lifejacket.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.655
Mom...

13:42.447 --> 13:43.823
- You sure?
- I'll...

13:46.117 --> 13:47.536
Hey.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.329
So, first my cottage,
and now my title?

13:49.412 --> 13:51.331
Can you just let me have
one thing?

13:51.414 --> 13:52.791
Can you just accept an apology?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.376
He ignores me for a week

13:54.459 --> 13:56.044
but he’ll talk about
his stupid title.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.629
It’s a family thing.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.089
Of course you wouldn’t
understand.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.174
Right. Cuz I
have four families.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.344
"Oooh, I’m Billie. Daddy
didn’t want me. Boo hoo."

14:04.427 --> 14:07.055
Well your grampa left me
the cottage, so I guess he did.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.641
Everything was just
normal fucked up

14:09.724 --> 14:11.101
until you made me think
you liked me.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.103
I did like you!

14:13.186 --> 14:15.647
You tried to steal my cottage
and then you lied to my face.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.065
I was high to your face!

14:17.148 --> 14:18.733
I tried to stop
your dumbass reno

14:18.817 --> 14:20.068
because you were crying
about your cottage

14:20.151 --> 14:21.903
being turned into a castle!

14:21.987 --> 14:24.447
So that was bullshit too.
That's great.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.032
Get your own lane, Killian.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.784
Twisting words
is your mom’s thing.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.952
Like playing
victim is your dad’s?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.370
Birth-dad!

14:37.752 --> 14:39.379
Just drop out.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.841
Please.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.801
You owe me.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.599
An apology.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.101
Which I already gave.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.442
Take the title.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.110
You already took
everything else.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.115
What happened?
You want me to come with you?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.034
- No.
- Are you sure--

15:09.117 --> 15:11.036
It's been a cruel summer.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.461
Okay, smile.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.131
Got it.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.592
You better come back next year.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.719
If Killian goes full himbo
I will have no one left.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.847
Come here.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.141
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:35.018 --> 15:40.565
Oh my, all hail
the new Junior champion!

15:40.649 --> 15:42.734
Barely. Killian forfeited.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.319
Still counts. Still proud.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.613
Still gonna drive Maisy
cuckoo-bananas.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.033
I’m sorry that things didn’t
work out with Killian.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.910
He’s a dumb dumb.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.037
Probably for the best with
the whole step-cousin vibe.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.414
Yeah, you didn’t want to
be DeFlowered-in-the-Attic.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.250
...Guess I was wrong.
Honesty isn’t always the way.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.585
Not if you’re high anyways.

16:00.669 --> 16:01.961
Holy shit, are you high?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.297
What did you take, weed? Molly?

16:04.381 --> 16:05.757
Did Ulrika give you peyote...

16:05.840 --> 16:07.759
Mushrooms.
At Quadchella. Relax.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.512
Thank fuck. Okay.
I'm sorry, yeah.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.014
Just, maybe don’t mention
that ever to your parents.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.724
I think they're finally
starting to see me

16:14.808 --> 16:16.101
as a crediblish human being.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.479
Hey. You need a second?

16:19.562 --> 16:22.148
Always. First time I
just obsess about my angles.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.859
Jokes. We’re actually all good.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.611
Billie’s gonna ride sidesaddle
with me.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.488
Dude brought a paddle.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.240
Clearly he wants to fight for
your honor.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
I love a lost cause.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.285
Oh, God, you guys.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.287
Okay, got any advice?
Or steroids?

16:36.371 --> 16:37.914
Just remember
to brace your core.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.916
I don't have one of those.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.377
Uh, this tilt is for
the cottage, isn't it?

16:44.754 --> 16:45.797
Yeah.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.925
Then your core is braced.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.223
Let's wreck her.

16:55.306 --> 16:59.185
<i>the Bad and the Ugly</i> ]

17:12.532 --> 17:14.617
God, it's so bright.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.828
Come on Justin!

17:21.666 --> 17:23.001
How do I look? Like a winner?

17:23.084 --> 17:25.420
- Yeah.
- Like a winner.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.630
You have a wedgie.
In the front.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.966
It's just how the liner
of the bathing suit sits.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.677
He's a bottom feeder,
you're a soaring bird.

17:33.470 --> 17:36.055
- It's go time.
- Let's do this.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.201
Oof, well...

17:56.284 --> 17:58.787
<i>We are passing the half-hour</i>
<i>mark of this tilt</i>

17:58.870 --> 18:01.206
<i>and still no winner in sight.</i>

18:01.289 --> 18:03.249
Well, let's get comfy.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.419
When my mother puts her mind to
something, she is relentless.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.839
There’s a word in Swedish
Obeveklig.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.758
What does it mean?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.176
Relentless. You just said it.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.096
Let's go!

18:18.389 --> 18:21.351
Come on, Maisy! Take
that little bitch down!

18:25.605 --> 18:26.981
Did you weight my paddle?

18:27.065 --> 18:28.233
Like you weighted mine.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.526
That was Dad’s go to move.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.693
Still not your dad.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.404
Oh, I'm gonna beat your ass.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.074
Just after this little rest.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.369
Yeah, you take
all the time you need.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.040
Don’t feel bad when you lose.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.876
You were never going
to get the murder cabin anyway.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.254
Whoreen’s gonna accept
my offer.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.424
You made an offer
on the Murder Cabin?

18:53.508 --> 18:54.592
Sure did.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.970
Oh! Oh, we had a deal!

18:57.053 --> 18:59.013
"Independent Women" ringtone]

18:59.097 --> 19:02.016
Oh! Sorry, sorry...
I have to take this.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.981
Whoreen...

19:08.940 --> 19:10.900
Fantastic!

19:10.984 --> 19:13.278
I’ll let the bidder know.
They’re here with me right now.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.404
Me too! Ha-ha!

19:16.030 --> 19:17.866
Whoreen has
accepted your offer!

19:17.949 --> 19:19.450
Congratulations Riley!

19:20.034 --> 19:21.077
- Riley?!
- Riley?!

19:22.579 --> 19:24.205
Yay...

19:24.289 --> 19:25.790
Damnit Jayne!

19:25.874 --> 19:27.417
Whoa!

19:31.337 --> 19:32.714
No!

19:37.552 --> 19:39.846
<i>Justin wins! Justin wins!</i>

19:39.929 --> 19:41.347
- I won?
- Yeah!

19:41.431 --> 19:42.849
I won!

19:44.392 --> 19:46.519
Lovejoy wins!

19:52.901 --> 19:55.445
I am the lady of the lake!

20:06.831 --> 20:10.793
Oh, you didn’t, um, label or
color-sort when you packed.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.922
Huh... Yeah, I guess
I just forgot.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.174
Oh, no, that’s wonderful.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.968
You know, adopted children
often feel compelled to control

20:19.052 --> 20:21.471
or over-perform, it’s just
that, um,

20:21.554 --> 20:23.765
you asked me for this
label-maker

20:23.848 --> 20:26.309
when you were seven and...

20:27.393 --> 20:28.853
my little girl is becoming a--

20:30.688 --> 20:33.691
A wo-- wo--

20:33.775 --> 20:35.109
Mom...

20:37.987 --> 20:41.032
Um, I’m going
to double-bag these

20:41.115 --> 20:42.951
before putting them in the car.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.161
For the bugs. And the germs.
And the smell of this place.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.205
Can you bring my hat and my
bags please? Thank you.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.459
- Okay.
- Do you need any help?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.461
All done.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.839
Thanks again for giving Billie
an amazing summer.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.341
We came through, didn’t we?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.051
Despite some light
child abandonment.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.636
Yeah.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.097
Well, I’ll let you two say bye.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.182
Billie-Bear,
we’ll be waiting in the car.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.142
Honey, there's a bird
in the backseat!

21:08.226 --> 21:09.686
Coming honey.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.855
That man look good in a hat.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.399
He looks good in everything.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.611
- So...
- So...

21:20.071 --> 21:22.031
- I have a present for you.
- You got me a gift?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.616
No, I didn't get a gift.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.993
I didn't know we were
doing gifts...

21:25.076 --> 21:27.996
- Too bad.
- My gift is outside?

21:28.079 --> 21:30.748
"May I Have This Dance"]

21:46.514 --> 21:48.433
You wanna talk about
what happened with Killian?

21:51.644 --> 21:52.687
Not really.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.317
You wanna talk about
Riley getting the cabin?

21:59.944 --> 22:01.070
Not really.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.372
So what about next year?

22:14.459 --> 22:20.173
I dunno... I lost the cabin,
I lost our cottage...

22:20.256 --> 22:23.176
Mm... Fuck it.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.178
We don’t need 'em.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.391
You could show me Paris.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.185
Or maybe Greece.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.353
- Oh.
- More shirtless men.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.731
I mean, I'll take it.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.107
Also Christmas.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.484
Mom and Dad throw a party.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.651
You should come.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.528
I’d really like that.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.117
Okay. I should go.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.452
Okay.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.080
They're probably
waiting for me.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.013
Shit.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.072
Goodbye.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.117
- Love you.
- Love you.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.314
- Hello.
- Hey.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.317
This is Joel Kinnaman.
She’s new to the lake.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.278
Sven and Lars
are a little jealous

24:05.361 --> 24:08.114
so maybe you will help and
train her to be a support bird?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.991
Hm? Yes.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.993
- There we go.
- Oh.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.203
Good, good. Good.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.415
Hi.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.168
Will you be my friend?

24:21.586 --> 24:23.963
Remember, she can smell fear.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.138
Hm.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.307
I’m sorry Whoreen
didn’t take your offer.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.893
But when I put on this blazer,

24:36.976 --> 24:40.396
I make a vow to do
what’s right for my client.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.441
Right, like the vow
you made with Wayne?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.111
The code of Real Estate
is unbreakable.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.864
My marriage was breaking me.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.199
But it all worked out.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.992
Justin didn’t get the cabin.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.077
He won’t be back next year.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.872
Which is why we're gonna
need a seasoned President

24:57.955 --> 25:00.041
to clean up his
mess next summer.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.085
- You’re running again?
- Mm-hm.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.962
But what about you being my VP?

25:05.046 --> 25:08.841
Well, we have to do what’s
best for the lake, right?

25:11.177 --> 25:12.762
Mm.

25:18.643 --> 25:22.146
Maisy-May, I have lived,
I have laughed,

25:22.230 --> 25:24.023
and I have loved with you.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.441
But I won't let you and Wayne

25:25.524 --> 25:27.485
hold this Girl Boss back
any more.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.614
I have lived in
your shadow for twenty years

25:31.697 --> 25:34.367
so I know
what you do in the dark.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.787
And I will use every one
of your pretty little lies

25:37.870 --> 25:40.164
to win President next summer.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.834
I’d hoped that you could
support me on my journey

25:43.918 --> 25:45.795
to Real Estate
Micro Influencer,

25:45.878 --> 25:50.216
but I won’t be bullied by your
exquisite face any more.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.844
I have to set an example
for my girls.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.221
Good luck with your renovation.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.099
I’m sure it will be
breathtaking.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.140
Save any for me?

26:41.392 --> 26:42.727
I’m not sharing.

26:43.894 --> 26:48.774
Figured there’d be a
lot of feelings today so--

26:48.858 --> 26:49.900
- -I brought my own.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.201
I've got nothing more to give.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.537
She’s spent.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.540
I didn’t know
you wanted the Murder Cabin.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.043
I would’ve told you but I
thought you were after Maisy’s.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.504
Nah, I’m just messing with you.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.675
These are happy carbs.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.010
Billie said
that she wants to go

27:16.093 --> 27:17.636
to Greece with me next summer.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.390
So you’re not mad
that I have the cabin?

27:21.474 --> 27:22.808
No.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.561
Who needs a cottage when
birth-dad and daughter

27:25.644 --> 27:27.563
are gorging themselves on
Mediterranean men

27:27.646 --> 27:29.940
and spitting them out like
olive pits.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.318
Or you could rent
a place on the lake

27:32.401 --> 27:34.487
from a starving artist.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.616
Birth Daddy's got the money
after Maisy’s buyout.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.160
I’m giving it back.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.787
This thing between me
and Maisy,

27:42.870 --> 27:44.538
it's never gonna end
if I keep it.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.124
I need closure.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.753
So do I.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.926
"Here "]

28:01.389 --> 28:03.015
You ready to ride a bike again?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.144
Look, ma. No hands.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.606
Why did I just talk
about my mother?

28:10.689 --> 28:11.941
- Yeah.
- That was weird.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.692
- Mm.
- I'm sorry.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.155
Lucky I’ve a
soft spot for roadkill.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.908
Lucky.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.835
Chips, chips! So many chips!

28:30.918 --> 28:32.545
Sorry.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.846
G’bye dacha...

28:43.806 --> 28:45.850
- Hey, hey!
- Hi.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.854
Did you take your name
off the trust?

28:49.937 --> 28:52.064
Yes, I did. I left a
message for the lawyer.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.858
Oh, you stupid fucking idiot!

28:53.941 --> 28:56.068
Would it kill you to think
ahead, just once?

28:56.152 --> 28:57.528
Oh!

28:57.611 --> 28:58.696
Oh!

28:58.779 --> 29:01.282
What the actual fuck?

29:01.365 --> 29:03.075
Who slaps people?

29:03.159 --> 29:05.369
You asked me to do it
you psycho!

29:05.453 --> 29:07.997
It’s okay... it’s okay...
I can fix it... I can fix it...

29:08.080 --> 29:09.498
I fix everything.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.588
What the fuck
is going on Maisy?

29:16.172 --> 29:20.593
Okay... by dissolving
the trust,

29:20.676 --> 29:23.429
the cottage reverts to your
father’s estate.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.222
It goes to my mother.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.894
To... Mimsie?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.188
She can sell it,
she can torch it,

29:32.271 --> 29:35.024
she could turn it into
a llama sanctuary if she wants.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.859
God, I should’ve
seen this coming

29:36.942 --> 29:38.819
but just being around you
makes me dumber.

29:38.903 --> 29:42.114
This is not my fucking
problem anymore, alright?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.866
Here’s your money back, Maisy.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.118
I’m moving on with my life.
You should too.

29:47.369 --> 29:52.249
Okay, yup, run away, go ahead.
He always runs away.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.044
You know what?
You are right.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.837
I am the worst.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.466
All you wanted was a big sister

30:00.549 --> 30:02.801
and all I wanted was to punch
you in your fat fucking face.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.304
I am confused.
Is this an apology?

30:05.387 --> 30:07.348
Because really
not sticking the landing.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.100
Yes, I locked you in the trunk
of my car.

30:10.184 --> 30:11.977
Yes, I took your bedroom.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.313
Yes, I told your dad
you had syphilis.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.440
But I was in Australia.
How did you know?

30:16.524 --> 30:18.192
- At fifteen.
- Fuck.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.735
You really are the worst.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
Baby, do you have
any gummies?

30:21.904 --> 30:25.282
Go, save yourself
before it's too late.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.201
- Mimsie’s here?
- I’m sorry...

30:27.284 --> 30:29.537
I really am sorry
for all of it.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.710
Shit, man.

30:41.048 --> 30:44.301
Okay.
Come on, that's my move.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.178
Let it go. That's it.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.181
That’s it, that's it--
Release. Release. Release.

30:49.265 --> 30:50.516
That's a girl.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.607
Come on.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.485
Let’s go meet our monster.
