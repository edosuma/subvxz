...34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42,

00:25.108 --> 00:29.570
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.905
- Killer is coming.
- The killer is coming.

00:31.906 --> 00:35.075
Killer is coming. Watch out, Kelly.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.202
I hear you.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.747
Hey, Nick! Missed you.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.540
Here, killer's here.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.085
Killers are coming,
killers are coming.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.129
Killers are coming.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.466
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.304
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.808
Wendy, you're it.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.103
All right, but I'll kill you all.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.605
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

01:06.441 --> 01:09.192
- Hey, this way.
- 18, 19, 20...

01:10.987 --> 01:13.155
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30...

01:37.597 --> 01:41.516
The killer is coming.
The killer's gonna get you.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.863
L-look, Kim.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.657
It's Nick.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.575
Nick!

02:01.371 --> 02:03.747
He's an idiot.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.960
Where's my geography book? Darn.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.713
I've got to go back for it.
Robin, you and Alex go on.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.215
Come on.

02:17.595 --> 02:21.431
Come on, they don't
want you in their game.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.851
Well, I'm not waiting.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.144
A-Alex...?

04:43.992 --> 04:47.535
Kill! Killer's got you.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.840
There!

05:02.385 --> 05:05.762
The killer's gonna get you, Kelly.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.143
Shut up.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.772
Killer's got you, Kelly.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.947
- Now you've done it.
- We know you're up here, Nick.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.534
The killers are coming.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.245
Here, killers, here.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.247
P-p-please.

05:34.625 --> 05:39.087
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.

05:39.088 --> 05:43.466
Kill! Kill! Kill!

05:45.219 --> 05:47.262
Killers are coming.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.431
Killers are coming.

05:49.432 --> 05:53.393
Killers are coming.
Killers are coming.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.604
Killers are coming.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.981
Killers are coming...

05:57.982 --> 05:59.775
killers are coming.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.651
Killers are coming...

06:01.652 --> 06:04.029
killers are coming.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.156
Killers are coming...

06:06.157 --> 06:08.200
killers are coming.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.662
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.706
Kill. Kill.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.667
Kill. Kill!

06:17.668 --> 06:22.464
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.925
Kill! Kill!

06:24.926 --> 06:26.635
P-p-please.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.972
I d-d-didn't want to p-play.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.141
Kill! Kill!

06:33.142 --> 06:35.727
Kill, kill!

06:35.728 --> 06:38.980
Kill. Kill...!

06:38.981 --> 06:42.025
Kill, kill!

06:42.026 --> 06:44.736
Kill! Kill!

06:44.737 --> 06:47.280
Kill, kill!

06:47.281 --> 06:49.491
Kill, kill...

06:49.492 --> 06:51.201
Kill! Kill!

07:02.797 --> 07:05.298
We've got to get somebody, quick.

07:05.299 --> 07:08.301
Are you crazy?
They'll put us in jail.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.096
If we tell anyone they'll
say it's our fault.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.306
Who'd believe it was an accident?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.975
- But what if...
- Listen to me.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.311
We'll go home now and
never, ever tell anyone.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.981
No one but us will ever know.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.775
- Jude, swear?
- I swear.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.028
- Kelly? Kelly!
- I don't want to go to jail.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.239
Swear?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.450
I swear.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.079
- Nick? Nick!
- I'll never tell.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.999
Good. Let's go.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.717
Probably the victim
of a sexual attack.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.761
She must have resisted.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.890
We think we know who's responsible.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.104
We'll pick them up for questioning.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.822
Vi. No!

09:23.145 --> 09:25.438
No. No...

09:28.526 --> 09:30.652
Oh, no.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.375
Uh, Vi...?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.544
Time to go. We've got to get back.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.999
Oh, Vi.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.712
Come on, now, trust me.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.637
Have a date for the prom yet?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.764
Mm-mm.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.809
Hm, I happen to know
Jude's still available.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.019
Now she is older and
very sophisticated.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.355
Come on, Kimbo.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.273
I may be hard up...

11:32.274 --> 11:33.858
Alex, she's cute.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.236
Besides, she's very funny
and very intelligent.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.946
It'll give you somebody to
do your equations with.

11:37.947 --> 11:42.117
Oh, great. You know I'm in charge
of the sound system tonight.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.827
Not bad, but it isn't romance.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.985
- Morning, Mr. Sykes.
- He's wacko.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.946
- Alex, no man is wacko.
- He really scares me.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.699
He's always looking
at women. I don't know.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.743
Kelly says he spies on the
girls in the locker room too.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.536
No, Sykes is not a Peeping Tom.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.246
He may have been here
for just a short time

12:28.247 --> 12:30.748
but he's been checked out.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.204
Hello?

13:09.205 --> 13:12.707
- Jude.
- Yes?

13:12.708 --> 13:16.961
Can you come out to play tonight?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.967
I'll see you at the prom.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.344
Still no date?

13:26.764 --> 13:30.350
- Getting closer though.
- A boy?

13:30.351 --> 13:34.521
An obscene call and not
very obscene at that.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.356
Sorry, Mom, gotta run.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.295
- Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
- No thanks.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.090
- Come on, I won't bite.
- So who are you?

14:02.091 --> 14:07.178
Seymour Crane. But, uh... they...

14:07.680 --> 14:11.474
...they call me Slick.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.768
I can see why.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.062
- How old are you, Slick?
- Old enough.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.649
Well, I've heard about guys like you
running over girls on the sidewalk.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.860
For some girls, if they're...

14:21.861 --> 14:25.112
if they're good looking,
I give 'em a ride.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.783
I'm going straight to Hamilton High.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.286
Straight to Hamilton High.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.445
James' residence.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.197
Kelly.

15:08.198 --> 15:12.493
It's been a long time.

15:12.494 --> 15:18.124
Tonight... it's my turn.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.809
Drew?

15:40.064 --> 15:42.857
Drew, is that you?

15:53.327 --> 15:55.286
Kelly.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.413
Where did you come from?

15:57.414 --> 15:59.457
The back door was open.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.252
I'm glad to see you too.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.673
Oh, Drew, this horrible
voice on the telephone.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.760
- It sounded so...
- What did you get? A heavy breather?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.096
It was worse than that.

16:13.097 --> 16:17.600
He turned you on, didn't he?
Maybe I should try that.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.227
I'm serious.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.441
So am I.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.860
Come on.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.685
- Come on, Nicky.
- Yeah, Dad. I'm coming.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.855
For a guy so fast on the disco
floor, you are the slowest.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.529
It's okay, Dad, it's my phone.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.453
- Why didn't you answer it?
- It's just Wendy.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.997
She's mad. She wants me to
take her to the prom tonight.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.291
I thought you two broke up.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.669
You can't tell Wendy anything
she doesn't want to hear.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.132
Are you still going with the Hammond
girl, the principal's daughter?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.925
Kim.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.928
God, I wish I had
your women problems.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.741
Dr. Fairchild, we only wanted
him for routine questioning

17:56.742 --> 17:58.993
but he tried to outrun
the detectives.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.453
Why did they have to chase him?

18:00.454 --> 18:04.165
The circumstances of the Hammond
girl's death are unclear.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.502
Murch lived near the place where she
died and he's a known sex offender.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.921
He was. Was, past tense.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.632
It might have helped if your men
had stopped harassing him.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.425
Maybe, Dr. Fairchild.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.720
But I believe he
killed Robin Hammond.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.477
You wanted to see me?

18:25.979 --> 18:29.816
Thanks for coming over, Doc.
Been a long time.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.653
I'm on a tight schedule. I hope
this is an emergency, Sergeant.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.364
Lieutenant. I was promoted last year.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.074
Great, congratulations.
What's the problem?

18:38.075 --> 18:41.160
Leonard Murch.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.579
This came over the wire.

18:43.580 --> 18:47.416
Last night, Murch escaped from
the state hospital in Cleveland.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.002
He took a nurse and her car with him.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.880
The authorities in Cleveland
say he's violent.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.424
Whew...

18:55.425 --> 18:57.468
I don't see how I can help.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.346
I haven't even seen Leonard
since he was institutionalized.

19:00.347 --> 19:04.267
- But you know him.
- Knew him, knew him. Past tense.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.477
- You think he'd head back here?
- I don't know.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.772
Come on. Even a guess will help.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.192
Lieutenant, you're asking me to
comment on a catatonic schizophrenic

19:13.193 --> 19:16.028
who was disfigured and
institutionalized six years ago.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.196
I'm sorry, I...

19:17.197 --> 19:19.782
Leonard Murch is an
unknown quantity now.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.119
McBride.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.163
Lieutenant, Unit 3 has
found that nurse.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.665
- Are they sure?
- Yeah, the description fits.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.917
- Where?
- Down at the old cottonwood.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.461
Okay, I'll be right over.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.089
He's back.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.823
Nick?

20:00.824 --> 20:03.450
Wendy.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.955
Do you still like to play games?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.457
Oh, get lost, Lou.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.757
Be home for dinner, Wendy?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.843
How the hell should I know?

21:02.469 --> 21:04.970
Save it.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.446
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Jude.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.865
- Missed you on the bus today.
- I didn't ride it.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.243
- No kidding.
- I got a ride.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.744
- Who with?
- None of your business.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.871
- Who with?
- A guy.

21:30.872 --> 21:34.834
A guy, huh? Who with, Jude?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.586
- Who?
- I'm going to the prom.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.505
What? What?

21:39.506 --> 21:40.923
The prom!

21:40.924 --> 21:43.551
Now I know why Kim
won't go out with me.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.927
She likes girls.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.595
It's better than kissing an ashtray.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.098
- Say goodbye, Lou.
- Goodbye, Lou.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.642
Hey, listen, you guys ever
get tired of each other,

21:51.643 --> 21:53.311
I'm always around, lonely.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.605
Oh really, give us a break.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.151
Good girl, must be exhausting.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.153
Why, look how he has to hold her up.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.788
Go sit on it, ape.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.000
Uh-oh.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.210
- When? I never.
- Yes, you did.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.379
Hi, Nick.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.299
See you later, lover.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.968
- I told her it was over.
- Worked real well.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.476
Kim...?

22:33.477 --> 22:36.812
- That's cruel.
- Oh, no, you don't.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.356
Nick, she's smiling.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.276
Got a big grin spread
all over her face.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.236
Race ya, honey blonde.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.447
No! Women in love coming through.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.351
- Where's the medical examiner?
- He's on his way.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.437
I also called for the meat wagon.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.647
Any sign of her car?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.483
No, Murch must have driven
it off after killing her.

23:22.484 --> 23:25.027
I got an APB out on it.

23:25.028 --> 23:28.447
Shouldn't be too hard
to find a beat-up VW.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.826
Hey, don't touch that.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.786
Might be the murder weapon.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.630
Can I take a look at the girl?

23:49.302 --> 23:53.305
Some butcher job, huh?

23:54.474 --> 23:56.975
Well, now we know he's back in town.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.645
Next question is why?

23:59.646 --> 24:01.980
Your guess is as good
as mine, Lieutenant.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.859
Revenge?

24:04.860 --> 24:06.485
Against who?

24:06.486 --> 24:10.489
You. The police.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.617
- The whole town.
- Oh, great.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.037
All we need is a full-scale
panic on our hands.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.873
Lieutenant, I think it would be wiser

24:18.874 --> 24:20.916
to keep quiet about this for now.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.461
Come on, you mean not tell 'em

24:23.462 --> 24:25.754
that there's a homicidal
fruitcake on the loose?

24:25.755 --> 24:26.922
Now think about it.

24:26.923 --> 24:30.759
Leonard can't move around
freely, not the way he looks.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.972
Yeah, you got a point.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.850
And we don't even know
if he's still in town.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.935
I fail to see any good

24:39.936 --> 24:43.897
in needlessly terrifying
the entire community.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.858
Listen, the last thing
I want to do is...

24:45.859 --> 24:48.194
Then keep it quiet.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.654
If it is Leonard,

24:50.655 --> 24:54.158
we should be able to pick
him up before nightfall.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.369
I hope you're right.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.147
Bravo.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.569
Practicing for tonight?

26:14.447 --> 26:17.324
As a matter of fact, I was.

26:17.325 --> 26:21.912
Practice makes perfect.
Kim is always so perfect.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.707
Uh, Nick likes me that way.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.292
Really?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.378
You are keeping in mind
that after tonight is all over,

26:29.379 --> 26:31.755
everything's gonna be back to normal?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.299
I mean, Nick is King of the Prom

26:33.300 --> 26:36.343
and you just happen to
be Queen of the Prom.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.054
But that's as far as
it goes, Hammond.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.891
You really ought to tell him that.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.644
I'm telling you, okay?

26:46.187 --> 26:49.023
You seem a little anxious, Wendy.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.691
By the way, who are you
going with tonight?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.738
It's not who you go with, honey.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.324
It's who takes you home.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.284
I'll try and remember.

27:00.285 --> 27:04.412
You wait and see. Just wait and see.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.044
I can't believe they
got it ready on time.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.879
Yeah, that disco floor
looked fantastic.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.714
- Know how much it cost?
- How much?

27:55.715 --> 27:58.216
Don't ask.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.972
Here's the incredible hunk himself.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.391
Mm-hm, looks like a party.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.309
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna
be too good for my diet.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.436
Mm-hm.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.070
Thank you. What else?

28:18.071 --> 28:20.030
- How about a muffin?
- No, cookie...

28:20.031 --> 28:21.699
Like me better now?

28:21.700 --> 28:22.991
It's an improvement.

28:22.992 --> 28:25.911
Well, if you like it so much,
why don't you taste?

28:25.912 --> 28:28.414
- No...
- Come on, be nice.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.915
No, let go!

28:29.916 --> 28:31.666
Alex!

28:32.919 --> 28:34.253
Alex!

28:34.254 --> 28:36.547
Get off of him!

28:36.548 --> 28:38.757
Get off!

28:38.758 --> 28:41.635
Get off of him! Alex!

28:44.013 --> 28:45.514
Alex!

28:45.515 --> 28:47.474
No, no!

28:52.313 --> 28:55.148
Alex!

29:02.407 --> 29:07.035
Alex?

29:07.036 --> 29:10.163
Cool it. Cool it!

29:13.835 --> 29:16.211
That's it, Perano,
this time you're out.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.963
Look, man, he started it.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.131
Alex?

29:19.132 --> 29:21.841
He was just trying to help me.

29:22.343 --> 29:25.512
You better come along with
us to your father's office.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.308
Are you okay?

29:32.771 --> 29:36.732
It just didn't work out, Wendy.
Why can't we just leave it at that?

29:36.733 --> 29:40.068
Well, because I don't
want to leave it at that.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.570
I do.

29:44.407 --> 29:47.284
Well, you blew it.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.872
Lou?

29:51.873 --> 29:54.458
I got this appointment.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.127
I'll wait.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.886
Vi, I have to go now.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.971
Now, we will be there
within the hour.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.973
Well, if you...

30:09.974 --> 30:12.475
Hello?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.022
You again?

30:17.023 --> 30:20.942
Brawling in the
cafeteria, both of them.

30:22.403 --> 30:25.113
All right, thank you.
I'll handle this.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.533
Explanations.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.493
Look, I was just fooling
around with this girl.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.119
Kim.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.873
And this... your son, he belted me.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.459
Is that true, Alex?

30:38.378 --> 30:40.212
- Huh, I knew it.
- You knew what?

30:40.213 --> 30:42.214
- Well, it just figures.
- That I'd play favorites?

30:42.215 --> 30:45.384
I'd take it easy on Alex because
he's my son? Well, you're right.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.929
You have been nothing but a disgrace
to this school and this community.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.432
You're suspended indefinitely.
Now get out.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.730
I'll see you around.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.614
Go and have the nurse
take a look at you.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.158
And come on back.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.887
The same place he
killed Robin Hammond.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.557
Why back here?

31:35.059 --> 31:38.228
What's he trying to prove?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.899
Revenge.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.984
Against who?

31:45.945 --> 31:47.988
Psychotic...

31:47.989 --> 31:50.073
disfigured...

31:50.074 --> 31:52.784
violent.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.038
He has to be hiding somewhere.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.751
Waiting.

32:05.548 --> 32:10.135
I've got to get that bastard
before he butchers someone else.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.611
You don't seem very excited.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.571
I am. It's just...

32:31.157 --> 32:33.408
in some ways, it's such an awful day.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.204
It's Robin's day.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.375
My mom's all upset.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.588
Dad is too. He's just
too strong to show it.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.717
You know, she would have
been a junior this year?

32:50.718 --> 32:53.720
Would have been her first prom.

32:55.348 --> 32:59.726
But the Queen of the Prom
must maintain her...

33:01.980 --> 33:04.481
...whatever.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.194
I love you.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.737
You know that?

33:10.738 --> 33:13.072
I love you too.

33:22.208 --> 33:27.086
I want you to know,
Robin's death, I remember it.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.508
I've always been
really sorry about it.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.845
I mean, I know what you're feeling.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.306
I...

33:41.102 --> 33:43.520
Listen, Kim...

33:44.647 --> 33:46.607
I, uh...

33:49.944 --> 33:51.945
I got to go.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.824
Yeah.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.493
See you later.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.010
- It's a nice car.
- Gets me around.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.513
Thank you.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.897
- You ready to order?
- Yes. What would you like?

34:26.898 --> 34:30.650
- Well, I'm a little short of cash.
- You can owe me.

34:30.650 --> 34:33.987
Yeah? Oh, well, I'll have
a couple of burgers,

34:33.987 --> 34:37.199
large fries and, uh,
what kind of beer you got?

34:37.199 --> 34:39.117
Come on, man,
this is a drive-in, not a bar.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.786
All right, don't get nervous.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.788
Just bring me a Coke
and bring her the same.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.790
No, a small diet cola, please.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.918
That's it?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.254
Yes, that's it.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.840
Nice.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.967
I'll buy you one for
Christmas, all right?

34:58.012 --> 35:00.097
Lou...?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.808
Lou!

35:02.809 --> 35:04.559
How do I know you're
serious about this?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.269
What do you mean, serious?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.230
Man, I hate that school, Hammond
and his whole fucking family.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.232
Okay, okay.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.359
Listen, I don't want anyone hurt.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.780
Not badly.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.741
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.136
You'll be in the gym promptly
at 3:15 for rehearsal, Kim?

35:41.013 --> 35:43.723
All right, girls,
let's try this again.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.066
Mr. Sykes...?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.485
This is just for you.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.903
Vicki?

35:56.904 --> 35:59.114
Vicki! Come here this instant.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.158
And you too, Jude.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.547
I'm not like the others, Kim.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.383
Drew needs somebody like Vicki
who'll give him what he wants.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.218
Vicki's sex life is
more talk than action.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.054
Besides, Drew wants you.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.724
I dunno. If I don't do it with him,

36:25.725 --> 36:27.642
I know he'll find somebody who will.

36:27.643 --> 36:31.354
- So? Let him.
- I'd die if he did.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.276
- What about you and Nick?
- What about me and Nick?

36:36.277 --> 36:39.196
What happened when he asked you?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.907
Maybe I asked him.

36:50.416 --> 36:54.336
Come on. Come on, Wendy.
I've got a thousand things to do.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.130
So? You think I don't?

36:58.007 --> 37:01.426
What's this? Is this
supposed to be funny?

37:01.427 --> 37:04.971
- I didn't do it.
- No.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.514
You're all idiots.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.726
- I didn't.
- Oh, shut up!

37:12.563 --> 37:15.648
She's out of her mind.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.617
I think I'll let Drew do it.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.744
Let him? Oh, that'd be interesting.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.246
Oh, you know what I mean.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.291
Well, I can't believe it.

37:54.814 --> 38:01.360
Hello?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.866
Who did it? Did you see?

38:06.867 --> 38:09.202
Uh-uh.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.705
Who was here?

38:13.457 --> 38:16.001
I don't know.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.585
Let's find out. Come on.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.962
Come on.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.833
- Who would do that?
- I don't know. Why?

38:59.337 --> 39:02.296
- Kelly...?
- What?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.580
Careful, Monty. A little higher.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.999
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, I'm glad you could make it.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.460
Yeah. If it isn't the literary
Miss Hammond.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.587
Let's get started.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.547
Alex!

39:44.548 --> 39:46.424
All set, Miss Ransom.
Just updating all the tapes.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.634
Oh, wonderful.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.678
You can be Mr. Hammond
for the rehearsal.

39:50.679 --> 39:54.307
Nick and Kim, onstage.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.734
George, could you close
the curtains, please?

40:06.404 --> 40:09.239
Now, you'll wait here.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.867
Nick? Nick?

40:12.868 --> 40:15.662
Scary place.

40:15.663 --> 40:19.165
Look, you are gonna be standing
up here tonight and not me.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.918
And if you don't know what
to do, you'll look the fool.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.587
Come on.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.966
Over there.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.265
Can you both hear me?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.975
Yes.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.477
- Can you hear me, Kim?
- Mm-hm.

40:39.478 --> 40:41.688
All right, Davy, start the tape.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.567
King and Queen of the
Alexander Hamilton

40:45.568 --> 40:48.111
High School Junior
Senior Prom for 1980,

40:48.112 --> 40:50.238
Nick McBride and Kim Hammond.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.740
These two seniors were selected
by their fellow students

40:52.741 --> 40:55.702
as the most popular boy
and girl in the class.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.078
Bull.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.663
Nick is a three-sport letterman

40:58.664 --> 41:00.665
and president of the Key Club.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.293
He plans to attend State
University in the fall.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.794
'Cause he couldn't
get in anywhere else.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.463
Kim is the head of the Dance Club

41:06.464 --> 41:09.883
and an all-around athlete ranked
number one on the girls' tennis team.

41:09.884 --> 41:12.594
- She hopes to become a teacher.
- If she ever graduates.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.971
Now, Alex.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.058
That's it, Alex. Now kiss her.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.560
- It's my sister.
- Alex.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.689
Good. Now the king.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.524
- Kiss the king?
- On the mouth.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.068
Shake hands.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.988
Now step back, Alex.

41:31.989 --> 41:35.866
All right, Kim and Nick,
move to the center of the floor.

41:37.912 --> 41:41.706
Now wait for your spotlights
and your music cue.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.001
And dance.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.170
It'll be beautiful.

43:52.463 --> 43:55.464
Jude, look.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.467
Why?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.307
Yeah, we've done that, Lieutenant.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.434
We got checkpoints
at all the main roads

44:06.435 --> 44:08.394
and the other units are
covering all the streets,

44:08.395 --> 44:11.397
plazas and garages around here.

44:11.398 --> 44:14.150
If that blue VW is still
in town, we'll find it.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.069
One more thing, Sayer,

44:16.070 --> 44:19.030
I want you to make sure to
double check the whole...

44:19.031 --> 44:21.449
the whole area around
the high school, okay?

44:21.450 --> 44:24.410
- Will do, Lieutenant.
- See you later.

44:32.711 --> 44:37.006
Hm, what am I wearing now?

44:37.508 --> 44:40.176
Oh, tonight?

44:40.969 --> 44:43.888
Yeah, well, you'll see soon enough.

44:43.889 --> 44:46.849
- Yeah, I guess.
- Okay, now listen, is it all set?

44:48.644 --> 44:52.605
It better. I don't want her
ever to forget this night.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.900
- Don't worry about it, Wendy.
- Okay.

44:55.901 --> 44:58.319
Bye, bye.

45:04.243 --> 45:05.743
- Kim?
- Yeah?

45:05.744 --> 45:08.663
Do you remember that dark
red lipstick that you like?

45:08.664 --> 45:12.458
- Did you take it?
- No. I haven't seen it.

45:12.459 --> 45:15.461
Why does everything have to
happen at the last minute?

45:15.462 --> 45:18.589
Mom? Mom? You look terrific.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.217
I remember putting it
on the dressing table.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.346
I saw it on the dressing table,
I know it was there.

45:25.347 --> 45:26.973
I'm sure you did.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.516
You look lovely, dear.

45:30.018 --> 45:33.020
Thank you.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.606
Well?

46:58.607 --> 47:00.817
- Amazing.
- You like?

47:00.818 --> 47:02.610
You look almost like a woman.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.820
Oh, thank you.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.154
You're welcome.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.782
Are you gonna help me with these or are
you gonna just stand there and leer?

47:07.783 --> 47:10.159
You're my sister. I'll leer.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.828
You're gonna get over here.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.623
Thank you.

47:15.624 --> 47:18.167
Oh, you've done this before, I see.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.420
- Stop it.
- No.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.047
Now.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.049
Stop it! I smell like
the ladies' room.

47:25.050 --> 47:28.635
How would you know? Oh,
of course, you know everything.

47:31.098 --> 47:34.808
- He's here.
- Better hurry.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.729
Would you get the door for me, sir?

47:38.730 --> 47:41.815
- Yes, Milady.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.370
Good evening.

47:55.247 --> 47:57.415
God, you're beautiful.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.208
Thank you.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.751
Thank you for the corsage.
It's perfect.

48:00.752 --> 48:03.796
It's no match for you.

48:03.797 --> 48:06.882
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

48:46.340 --> 48:49.091
Good Lord, what was that?

48:49.092 --> 48:51.552
My date.

49:09.237 --> 49:11.572
What the hell is this?
Where's your suit?

49:11.573 --> 49:13.741
It's in the trunk.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.659
Listen, don't worry about it.

49:27.172 --> 49:29.840
Look, the guys needed a ride, okay?

49:29.841 --> 49:32.593
Couldn't the guys have got
a ride with someone else?

49:33.136 --> 49:35.721
It's better like this.

49:36.848 --> 49:38.390
Ah-hh.

49:39.726 --> 49:42.937
- Come on, we're gonna party.
- No.

49:42.938 --> 49:45.647
Look, this whole thing
was your idea, right?

49:48.402 --> 49:53.322
Anyway, you look terrific.

52:29.729 --> 52:31.730
Hi.

52:31.731 --> 52:33.274
This is Seymour.

52:33.275 --> 52:35.276
We've met.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.443
Whoo-hoo.

52:36.444 --> 52:39.655
- Hey, I'm Slick.
- So I noticed.

52:41.575 --> 52:44.034
A token, nothing more.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.621
I'm sorry we missed your
grand entrance, Kim,

53:28.622 --> 53:32.082
but Vi's been very upset.

53:32.083 --> 53:33.751
I took her for a walk
to calm her down.

53:33.752 --> 53:36.462
She's probably just nervous.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.839
Yeah, I hope so.

53:39.341 --> 53:42.468
- Come on, Daddy, relax.
- Oh, I'm relaxed.

53:42.469 --> 53:45.262
Principal by day,
disco king by night.

54:21.049 --> 54:23.341
Thanks for the dance.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.306
- Do you believe her?
- Let's show her what we can do.

57:56.097 --> 57:58.765
McBride, anything?

57:59.642 --> 58:01.518
No, still nothing, Lieutenant.

58:01.519 --> 58:04.020
I'll check in later.

58:07.066 --> 58:08.901
I thought she'd explode.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.612
- It that dress, it wouldn't take much.
- She looks great.

58:11.613 --> 58:12.905
Listen, if you need a
ride home afterwards.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.073
Thanks.

58:16.159 --> 58:17.618
- Hi.
- How are you, okay?

58:17.619 --> 58:20.162
It'll be okay as long as we
stay on the dance floor.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.789
- It's tough in the trenches.
- We'll be around if you need support.

58:22.790 --> 58:23.999
Or an extra pair of hands.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.084
Ready? We don't want
to keep Preppie waiting.

58:26.085 --> 58:28.878
He'll never miss me. He's seen Wendy.

58:30.548 --> 58:34.301
It's really no big deal, Kelly.
It's like getting a shot.

58:34.302 --> 58:37.846
Listen to the instant expert.
One date, and she's a sex counselor.

58:37.847 --> 58:41.349
I know what I like.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.623
No, I can't, Drew.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.709
Kelly, I want you so bad.

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.838
You know how I feel about you.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.989
No.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.413
What are you,
some fairytale princess?

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.917
Drew, please.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.752
"Drew, please."

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:19.507
If you don't...

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:22.969
I know plenty who will.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:55.126
Drew, you bastard!

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:02.050
You'll be back.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:39.671
Now, Kelly.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.548
Now.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.102
Kim!

01:03:37.855 --> 01:03:41.357
I believe this is our dance, Monty?

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.656
We've had every man looking
for some sign of him

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.325
or that car all day.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.744
Damn right I'm upset,

01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:56.956
and I need some results,
and soon, okay?

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:09.594
Oh, oh.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.732
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.825
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:37.455
My glasses.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.760
You going somewhere?

01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.096
Nature calls.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.647
Don't go away.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.697
Was it, uh...

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:13.825
- was it okay?
- Oh, God.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:17.412
Yeah, ha, me too. The best.

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.582
- Ever?
- Well...

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.418
You're my first too.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.504
Really?

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:33.136
Wow, there's a million
stars out there.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:35.180
Yeah, I figured that's
what they were.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.098
Can't see a thing without my glasses.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.560
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't we
take a walk along the bluffs?

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:43.312
Very funny.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.775
Why don't we do it on the bluffs?

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.068
On the bluffs?

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.405
Come on, it'll be fantastic.

01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:53.907
Wow!

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:57.034
Ah, I can't see.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.105
What was what?

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.441
What was what?

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.192
Somebody's out there.

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:14.988
Why don't, uh, why don't
we go back in the van?

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.614
Why?

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:19.075
I think I need another joint.

01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:21.369
I think you do too.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.538
Follow me.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.501
I'll just fold this up.

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:33.923
I can hardly believe it.

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:36.176
This morning, I didn't even know you.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.844
And I figured I was out of luck

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.929
as far as going to the
prom was concerned.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.264
And now...

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.224
Yeah, me too.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:46.143
Funny how fast our life changes.

01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:02.619
Hand me the history book.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.413
You think this is the time to study?

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:01.386
You know, I'll remember this night

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:03.429
for the rest of my life.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.725
Of course.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.563
So will I.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.898
No!

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:16.984
Now! Now!

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.670
Argh!

01:11:32.329 --> 01:11:35.122
I wonder what they're scheming now.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.250
We've got to show 'em who's boss.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:41.421
Look, I thought I told you
I didn't want anyone hurt.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:44.340
Stop telling me what to do.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.343
Jerk.

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:15.412
Hey, have you got any mascara?

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:22.044
Have you got any mascara?

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.715
Shit.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:47.445
What are you doing?

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:50.072
- Lou?
- Now!

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:58.164
Help!

01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:00.632
Oh-hh!

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:12.723
Now!

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:15.351
Now! Now!

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.906
I had to tell you myself. We got him.

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:30.157
Where? When?

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:33.327
Well, actually the state patrol
got him, out near Alderson.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.829
That's over 50 miles from here.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:39.207
Yeah, he must have left town after
he killed that girl in the convent.

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:42.670
Well, I can start enjoying the prom.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.630
See you in the morning, Sayer.

01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:48.967
Good night, Lieutenant.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.224
Hey, Drew. Have you seen my Dad?

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:58.269
- Kim, where's your father?
- I was just looking for him.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.187
It's almost time for
the Royal Procession.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.690
Who's to present the bouquet?

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.568
- Mr. Weller?
- Oh, no.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:09.696
Of course, Monty.
Why didn't I think of that my...

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:22.459
Loose... there's a killer loose.
There's a killer loose.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.919
Poor guy's had too much to drink.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.671
I'm calling for the patrol
car to take him in.

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:28.924
We'll be right back, Nicky.
Come on, let's go.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:33.512
- What did he do?
- Just drank too much, I guess.

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:35.055
Hm, fits right in with this crowd.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.724
All right, everybody,
the excitement's over.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.684
It's time to get ready
for the Procession.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.233
Break a leg, Your Majesty.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.902
Oh, thank you, Maid of Honor.

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:51.113
Are you all set, Davy?
Well, let's go.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.467
It's time.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:14.011
- What about Wendy?
- Screw her.

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:16.555
I'll just have sweet
Kim all to myself.

01:22:17.682 --> 01:22:21.352
So if Wendy don't get here,
we let the Hammond girl go?

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.853
You got it.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.564
Any questions?

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:27.524
No, Buddy'll take care of Kim.

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:29.025
Take off.

01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:32.279
Okay, it's parade time.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.411
Hold still.

01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:42.498
- Real cute.
- You look fine.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:44.291
Now don't forget to
start on the trumpets.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.841
Now!

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:23.074
Don't panic! Don't panic!

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:38.256
Nick?

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.204
- My leg.
- Come on, get up.

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:12.040
Come on, get up!

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:24.302
Now, it's my turn.

01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:28.306
No!

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:32.245
No!

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:14.913
This is the police.

01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:17.416
- Killers are coming.
- Please calm down.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.167
Other police units are on their way.

01:28:19.168 --> 01:28:20.335
Kill!

01:28:20.336 --> 01:28:22.671
Please calm down. Move to one side

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:25.549
so they can get through
when they arrive. I repeat...

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.634
Killers are coming!

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:30.387
Officer: Everything is under control.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:34.098
Kill! Killers are coming.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.852
- Watch out, Kelly.
- I hear you!

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:38.228
Oh, my God!

01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:40.772
- Hey Nick.
- There's Jude.

01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:42.983
Here, killer's here.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.484
Kill!

01:28:46.195 --> 01:28:48.613
- Kill!
- Don't shoot him!

01:28:48.614 --> 01:28:50.866
- Kill!
- Kim, get back.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.119
Halt, or I'll shoot.
What are you doing?

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.455
Kill, kill, kill!

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:59.874
Kill!

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:10.260
I...

01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:16.140
I... saw it. Saw it all.

01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:20.144
They... they killed her.

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:24.566
They... killed her.

01:29:24.567 --> 01:29:29.320
Robin, Robin.
