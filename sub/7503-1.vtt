02:29.582 --> 02:31.914
Oh! Oh!

05:57.824 --> 06:01.419
Hollywood!

07:22.607 --> 07:27.135
Get your mind off that dame and back on
the job or we'll never get outta here.

07:27.212 --> 07:29.146
This war's been goin' on
for the last ten years.

07:29.214 --> 07:31.307
You had Japs
in Manchuria in 1931,

07:31.383 --> 07:33.544
the Eye-ties
in Ethiopia in 1935,

07:33.618 --> 07:37.247
the Krauts been blitzkrieging
your favorite European tourist
attractions the last 3 years.

07:37.322 --> 07:40.018
Last year in Africa,
it took General O'Connor and
his British tanks two months...

07:40.091 --> 07:43.356
to grab Libya and it took
Rommel 12 days to get it back.

07:43.428 --> 07:46.090
Jesus!
Look at this creamation!

07:46.164 --> 07:48.098
You're supposed to be drying
dishes, not killing people.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.657
Give me that turkey leg.
I'll shove it up your ass.

07:50.735 --> 07:52.726
What's the matter with you?
Look at all this good food over here.

07:52.804 --> 07:57.741
- Pop, Wally made me cook!
- Wally, my ass! Looka here!
Perfectly good eggs!

07:57.809 --> 08:00.471
What the hell's the matter with you,
throwing away food like that?

08:00.545 --> 08:03.514
Put it back over the stove,
warm it up for them fellows out there.

08:03.581 --> 08:07.517
Let's mutilate this food before
they can serve it to anyone else.

08:07.585 --> 08:09.780
They are so disgusting.

08:09.854 --> 08:11.788
If you don't quit hanging
around with that playboy,

08:11.856 --> 08:14.381
you gonna end up with a record
you can't play on the jukebox.

08:14.459 --> 08:16.393
- But, Pops...
- Pops? I ain't your Pops!

08:16.461 --> 08:19.862
But, Pops, I've been practicin'
all week. I'm takin' dancing lessons.

08:19.931 --> 08:23.196
- I seen you dance.
You can't dance worth a spit.

08:23.268 --> 08:25.202
Give me that thing.
Jesus.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.966
When are you gonna remember which side
of the tracks you come from, boy?

08:28.039 --> 08:30.269
- We need more coffee.
- Coming right up.

08:30.342 --> 08:34.607
Clean that place up right there!

08:41.586 --> 08:44.179
What's your problem, kid?
You got ants in your pants?

08:44.255 --> 08:46.485
I was just practicing
some dance steps.

08:46.558 --> 08:48.492
- Dance steps?
- Mm-hmm.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.495
You got somethin' to be
dancin' about, bub?

08:51.563 --> 08:53.895
- I don't know. Maybe I do.
- Maybe you do?

08:53.965 --> 08:57.765
There's a war on, pal. I want to know
why you're not in uniform.

08:57.836 --> 08:59.997
I want to know what you're
doin' dancin' around tables.

09:00.071 --> 09:02.096
I want to know why
you're not in the Army.

09:02.173 --> 09:05.404
- 'Cause I don't take
orders from anybody.
- A tough guy, huh?

09:05.477 --> 09:07.809
Whoa!

09:07.879 --> 09:11.610
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

09:11.683 --> 09:15.050
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You got egg on my uniform.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.782
- I'm very sorry.
- I hate eggs.

09:17.856 --> 09:21.121
- Eggs are good for you.
- I can't stand eggs. I hate eggs.

09:21.192 --> 09:24.127
- Look out, Wally.
- Watch it! He's got a leg.

09:24.195 --> 09:27.926
That ain't the way you do it!

09:27.999 --> 09:29.933
Can it, Sitarski!
Save it for the Japs!

09:30.001 --> 09:32.026
For cryin' out loud, Sarge.
Look at this bozo.

09:32.103 --> 09:34.037
Anybody who wears a shirt
like that is askin' for it.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.073
He's an American, Sitarski.

09:36.141 --> 09:38.575
If it's one thing we don't want, it's
seeing Americans fighting Americans.

09:38.643 --> 09:40.907
I won't stand for that.
Not here, not anywhere.

09:40.979 --> 09:43.504
We've had our chow.
Move out.

09:43.581 --> 09:47.073
- You okay, kid?
- You're not gonna tip him,
are ya, Sarge?

09:47.152 --> 09:50.485
- That's okay. I don't need your tip.
- I think you do.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.217
Get rid of that shirt.
It's in bad taste.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.851
Come on! Clean them floors up
like I told ya!

09:55.927 --> 09:58.521
Floors haven't been washed
in 10 years. It'll take me all night.

09:58.596 --> 10:01.656
I don't give a damn
if it takes 20 years.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.928
He can't work tonight.
Tonight's his big night.

10:04.002 --> 10:06.596
- Tonight's the night
of the Jitterbug contest.
- Jitterbug? Hell!

10:06.671 --> 10:08.639
That reminds me. Kill them
cockroaches in that flour sack.

10:08.706 --> 10:12.608
Pop, he can't work. He's gotta dance!

10:12.677 --> 10:15.612
Pop! Pop!
You can't do this to me!

10:15.680 --> 10:19.741
I'll do anything! I gotta get
that money! I gotta get that suit!

10:19.818 --> 10:22.184
Only way you'll get a suit
is steal one.

10:22.253 --> 10:25.689
- Now scram! Get out!
- Ow! Oh!

10:25.757 --> 10:29.625
Easy come, easy go.

10:29.694 --> 10:33.061
Oh, no, you think
that's gonna stop me?

10:33.131 --> 10:38.068
Nothing's gonna stop me from being
with Betty Douglas tonight.

10:38.136 --> 10:40.536
- Um, Miss Fitzroy?
- Yes, Betty?

10:40.605 --> 10:44.598
Does this mean we won't be allowed
to dance with civilians tonight?

10:44.676 --> 10:47.236
That is correct.

10:47.312 --> 10:51.715
In fact, civilians will no longer
be permitted in this facility.

10:51.783 --> 10:56.186
The worid is changing, giris,
and we have to change with it.

10:56.254 --> 10:58.552
These men in uniform
are after one thing...

10:58.623 --> 11:01.854
I don't want to hear any more talk
about your precious morality.

11:01.926 --> 11:04.554
Morale. Now that
is what is important.

11:04.629 --> 11:07.723
You are gonna have
to smile at men...

11:07.799 --> 11:10.666
who you would never give
a second glance to in peacetime.

11:10.735 --> 11:12.760
Yes, Miss Fitzroy.

11:12.837 --> 11:15.772
Make polite conversation with men
whose minds are in the gutter.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.831
Yes, Miss Fitzroy.

11:17.909 --> 11:21.811
You are gonna have to dance and dance
close with men you might find repulsive.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.814
Eww!

11:31.890 --> 11:37.123
Oh, heaven, heaven.
Some of them are really cute!

11:37.195 --> 11:40.096
I want you!

11:40.165 --> 11:41.598
Eight o'clock!

11:41.666 --> 11:43.099
I can't take it!

11:43.168 --> 11:44.897
- Seven-thirty!
- I love you!

11:44.969 --> 11:46.766
Tonight!

11:46.838 --> 11:49.102
I love you!

11:52.143 --> 11:57.274
That's all Reed Jack, one of our
better boogie-woogie suits.

11:57.348 --> 12:01.284
- And very expensive.
- Excuse me. What do you mean by that?

12:01.352 --> 12:05.448
It's just that I couldn't help noticing
what you were wearing when you came in.

12:05.523 --> 12:09.323
My good man, are you accusing me of not
having enough dough to pay for this?

12:09.394 --> 12:11.794
- Shh!
- I might as well leave this store.

12:11.863 --> 12:15.390
No. Come back. Try on the hat.
It goes with the suit.

12:15.466 --> 12:18.128
You know what I mean?

12:22.907 --> 12:26.866
It's not gonna work. It ain't
gonna work. It's not gonna work.

12:26.945 --> 12:29.004
Elsewhere
in the news, it's been reported...

12:29.080 --> 12:33.210
that two squadrons of Japanese planes
flew over San Francisco last night.

12:33.284 --> 12:35.218
They bombed Pearl Harbor.
Now they're going to come here.

12:35.286 --> 12:37.754
They bombed Pearl Harbor.
Now they're going to come here.

12:37.822 --> 12:41.383
They bombed Pearl Harbor!
Now they're going to come here!

12:43.695 --> 12:46.391
Thank you, but no, thank you.
I have changed my mind.

12:46.464 --> 12:49.524
- I do not want it!
- What do you mean
you changed your mind?

12:49.601 --> 12:52.468
- I'm sorry, sir. I am taking it off.
- But you wanted a suit.

12:52.537 --> 12:56.769
I learned one thing today:
I will never shop east of Beverly Hills.

12:56.841 --> 13:00.436
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

13:00.511 --> 13:03.071
It ain't gonna work.

13:03.147 --> 13:04.637
Why do I always have troubles
on Christmas...

13:04.716 --> 13:07.981
It's not gonna work.

13:08.052 --> 13:12.546
- Why can't I have a...
What? Oh, my God.

13:12.624 --> 13:15.855
God.

13:19.664 --> 13:23.259
Air raid.
Japs. Japs!

13:23.334 --> 13:26.269
Japs!

13:26.337 --> 13:29.329
Get outta my way!

13:29.407 --> 13:33.707
Air raid!

13:33.778 --> 13:36.372
I never thought
they'd be this nervous.

13:36.447 --> 13:39.905
Hi, giris. Your first air raid?
Are you two sisters?

13:39.984 --> 13:43.010
- Get lost!
- We want a man!

13:43.087 --> 13:45.214
Soldier! Soldier!
Help us!

13:45.290 --> 13:48.259
Hey, Wally, I think we swiped
the wrong style.

13:48.326 --> 13:51.295
- What?
- Those gals are khaki wacky!

13:51.362 --> 13:53.762
- They're what?
- Look at that!

13:53.831 --> 13:57.323
- Dames are falling for uniforms.
- I don't want dames!

13:57.402 --> 13:59.563
All I want is to dance
with Betty tonight.

13:59.637 --> 14:02.663
Come on!
Let's get outta here!

14:02.740 --> 14:07.109
Everybody, down!
Everybody, down!

14:07.178 --> 14:10.306
This is your
diagonal warning!

14:10.381 --> 14:13.218
Everybody, down!

14:24.796 --> 14:26.821
Oh, no.

14:50.088 --> 14:52.648
Fill 'er up.
Ethyl.

14:55.159 --> 14:57.389
Where?

14:59.297 --> 15:02.528
It was just a case of war nerves.
Two squadrons of Japanese Zeroes...

15:02.600 --> 15:05.364
The Japs tried to bomb
San Francisco last night.

15:05.436 --> 15:09.896
Two squadrons of Jap Zeroes.
I've been trackin' them ever since.

15:09.974 --> 15:12.272
I lost them
somewhere over Fresno.

15:12.343 --> 15:15.278
Radio says that's not true
about San Francisco.

15:15.346 --> 15:18.144
- It was just a case of war nerves.
- War nerves?

15:18.216 --> 15:21.447
- Yeah.
- Who said, "war nerves"?

15:21.519 --> 15:24.784
I heard it
on that radio there.

15:26.457 --> 15:29.984
- Radio's wrong.
- Oh, my God!

15:36.534 --> 15:38.764
Oh, shit!

15:41.205 --> 15:43.833
Oh!

15:43.908 --> 15:46.399
Stop that plane!

15:48.513 --> 15:51.744
Stop! Stop!
Damn it! Stop!

15:59.524 --> 16:03.790
Madness. It's the only word
to describe it.

16:03.861 --> 16:07.126
This isn't the state of California.
This is a state of insanity.

16:07.198 --> 16:09.962
General Stilwell,
Colonel Grant suggests dispatching...

16:10.034 --> 16:12.594
guard units to all
the city reservoirs.

16:12.670 --> 16:16.538
Intelligence suspects that
Fifth Columnists are going to...

16:16.607 --> 16:19.701
"pour poison into
the water supply."

16:19.777 --> 16:23.042
And G-2 should pour knockout
drops into the water supply.

16:23.114 --> 16:26.083
Maybe the people of the city would
calm down and leave the war to the Army.

16:33.491 --> 16:35.959
Stand off!

16:36.027 --> 16:39.155
Sir? Sir? The General.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.425
- My fingers. I need them over here.
- Do you hear sirens?

16:41.499 --> 16:44.195
- Captain Birkhead.
General Stilwell is here.
- Do I hear sirens?

16:44.268 --> 16:46.759
Ow! Oh!
Sirens!

16:46.838 --> 16:49.534
- What are you doin'?
I'm not finished yet.
- Oh!

16:49.607 --> 16:54.601
- Sorry, Captain. Captain,
what's your name again?
- Loomis Birkhead.

16:54.679 --> 16:58.206
- Sorry, Captain Birkhead,
but that's General Stilwell.
- Wait!

16:58.282 --> 17:02.446
- I've got to get my story!
- I was just giving it to you.

17:04.722 --> 17:08.681
I'll tell ya, DuBois, there are
positive and negative aspects...

17:08.760 --> 17:11.786
about being a general's aide.

17:11.863 --> 17:14.297
The general couldn't have been
a couple more minutes late, could he?

17:14.365 --> 17:17.561
It is wartime, and we all
have to make sacrifices.

17:17.635 --> 17:20.832
Here he comes!

17:20.905 --> 17:23.430
- You have a telegram
from Colonel Maddox, sir?
- Madman Maddox?

17:23.508 --> 17:25.476
- What does he want?
- Troops, sir.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.603
Troops? It's a practice bombing range
in Barstow in the middle of the desert.

17:28.679 --> 17:31.409
What's he want troops for?
Give me that.

17:31.482 --> 17:34.280
"Request emergency troops.
Invasion imminent.

17:34.352 --> 17:39.085
Suspect hidden Jap airfield
in Pomona alfalfa fields."

17:39.157 --> 17:42.092
I blame myself.
I put that lunatic out there.

17:42.226 --> 17:46.185
Jesus H. Christ, DuBois.
Is that the General's new secretary?

17:46.264 --> 17:48.425
Yes, sir.
She came in from G-2 this morning.

17:48.499 --> 17:53.198
- Not bad, huh?
- Not bad? She's a goddess.
A goddamn goddess!

17:53.271 --> 17:56.729
That is Donna Stratton.
I knew her back in Washington.

17:56.808 --> 18:00.244
She has got this thing
for planes.

18:00.311 --> 18:03.371
One of those real
high-flyin' types, huh?

18:03.448 --> 18:05.382
I've never seen
anything like it.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.475
She's got planes
on the brain.

18:07.552 --> 18:11.886
His brother had all those
political connections in Georgia.
What could I do?

18:11.956 --> 18:14.686
Tell him to hold his position.
I'll send someone up there later.

18:14.759 --> 18:17.353
Where's Birkhead?
He's supposed to have my lunch.

18:17.428 --> 18:20.989
B-17.

18:21.065 --> 18:23.898
Ooh.

18:23.968 --> 18:28.371
No man has ever gotten to first
base with her on the ground.

18:28.439 --> 18:32.273
But get her into a plane, she'll bat
your balls right out of the park.

18:32.343 --> 18:35.005
- You can fly, sir?
- Who said anything about flying?

18:35.079 --> 18:39.482
I just gotta get her into that plane.
I'll fake the rest.

18:58.302 --> 19:00.361
Hello, Donna.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.669
Donna Stratton, after all this time.
How long has it been?

19:03.741 --> 19:05.936
Not long enough.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.001
You're not still sore,
are you, Donna?

19:08.079 --> 19:10.775
Yes! In
a number of places.

19:10.848 --> 19:13.180
Same old Donna.

19:13.251 --> 19:15.219
Listen, I got a great idea.

19:15.286 --> 19:18.119
Why don't we get together for dinner
tonight? We got a lot to talk about.

19:22.527 --> 19:27.555
What could you and I
possibly have to talk about?

19:27.632 --> 19:29.827
Airplanes.

19:29.901 --> 19:33.428
I seem to recall that you always
had a very keen interest in aircraft.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.438
Now, take this B-17,
for example.

19:35.506 --> 19:39.943
A woman like you is bound
to appreciate a plane like the 17.

19:40.011 --> 19:44.141
After all, it's big.
It's the biggest one here.

19:44.215 --> 19:47.116
You know what else?
It's got a lot of range.

19:47.184 --> 19:49.345
- You know what I mean
by range, don't you?
- Oh, sure.

19:49.420 --> 19:54.289
It can stay up for a long time.
A very long time.

19:54.358 --> 19:56.952
It's built firm
and solid.

19:57.028 --> 20:02.523
It has to be, because of its
tremendous forward thrust.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.037
And when this baby
delivers its payload,

20:07.104 --> 20:09.072
devastating.

20:12.243 --> 20:16.509
- Oh, Captain.
Let's get something straight.
- Please do.

20:16.581 --> 20:19.482
I don't like you.
I don't like the way you act.

20:19.550 --> 20:23.611
I especially don't like
your immature sexual innuendoes.

20:23.688 --> 20:25.679
- I was just kidding.
- The B-17 happens to be...

20:25.756 --> 20:28.452
- the most valuable
strategic air bomber...
- Damn it!

20:28.526 --> 20:32.121
- When I went to flight school,
we were taught to secure these.
- In the United States Air Corps.

20:32.196 --> 20:35.063
I didn't know you
went to flight school.

20:35.132 --> 20:37.965
I only logged in a couple of hours
in a little Beechcraft Trainer...

20:38.035 --> 20:41.061
before I got kicked out...
upstairs to become the General's aide.

20:41.138 --> 20:44.505
- But can you fly the B-17?
- B-17?

20:44.575 --> 20:46.839
- Can you fly the B-25?
- A plane's a plane.

20:46.911 --> 20:48.936
- Can you fly the 24 Liberator?
- Propeller and four wings.

20:49.013 --> 20:50.981
Can you fly
the 38 Lightning?

20:51.048 --> 20:53.141
You can fly one,
you can fly them all.

20:53.217 --> 20:55.242
Sure, I could fly the 17.

20:55.319 --> 20:59.756
I'm sorry, Captain.
I didn't realize you had a serious
interest in strategic bombers.

20:59.824 --> 21:02.554
Donna, my interest
is very strategic.

21:02.627 --> 21:07.031
How would you like me
to show you the cockpit?

21:07.164 --> 21:11.965
First let me say the possibility of
the Japs bombing us is, at best, remote.

21:12.036 --> 21:15.995
However, we're installing
antiaircraft batteries all over town.

21:16.073 --> 21:20.032
In addition, we have
a vast network of civil defense
volunteer aircraft spotters...

21:20.110 --> 21:22.044
keeping a constant vigil.

21:22.112 --> 21:26.947
They report their sightings directly
to Interceptor Command Headquarters.

21:27.017 --> 21:29.952
In the event of a sighting
that cannot be immediately
identified by Headquarters,

21:30.020 --> 21:33.353
we go to a condition yellow
as a precaution.

21:33.424 --> 21:37.520
The aircraft maintains its position
and attempts to identify it fail,

21:37.594 --> 21:39.789
we go to a condition blue.

21:39.863 --> 21:45.233
The situation persists,
we cannot establish radio
contact, we go to a red alert.

21:45.302 --> 21:48.965
During a red alert,
air raid sirens will sound.

21:49.039 --> 21:53.874
All lights must be turned out.
Searchlights will scan the skies
for enemy aircraft.

21:53.944 --> 21:56.037
Gun crews will be at ready.

21:56.113 --> 21:58.047
I hope.

21:58.115 --> 22:00.481
Clear the props!

22:00.551 --> 22:04.988
Boost pump on.
Energize. Engage. Ignition!

22:05.055 --> 22:08.388
Are we cleared for takeoff?

22:08.459 --> 22:10.927
B-17, two, seven, one.

22:10.994 --> 22:13.861
Cleared for takeoff
on runway one-eight.

22:13.931 --> 22:15.865
Winds from the southwest.

22:15.933 --> 22:18.925
- You want the stick?
- Yes, yes, yes. Give it to me.

22:21.672 --> 22:25.073
All right. Now.

22:25.142 --> 22:28.600
We are rolling.

22:28.679 --> 22:31.705
We're rolling
down that runway...

22:31.782 --> 22:34.808
faster and faster.

22:34.885 --> 22:37.479
- I don't feel any thrust.
- Don't worry. You will!

22:37.554 --> 22:40.387
You will.
All right, all right.

22:40.457 --> 22:43.017
Max power!
We're past the point of rejection.

22:43.093 --> 22:46.585
- Get your nose up!
Pull back on that stick!

22:48.398 --> 22:51.026
Oh, very good.

22:51.101 --> 22:53.433
Landing gear up.

22:53.504 --> 22:57.838
And now we're leveling off
at 20,000 feet.

22:57.908 --> 22:59.705
Turn the wheel to the right.

23:02.579 --> 23:05.605
Good. We're at 20,000 feet.

23:06.683 --> 23:09.117
Ow!

23:09.186 --> 23:11.313
- What's that?
- Nothing. It was a little turbulence.

23:11.388 --> 23:13.686
We hit an air pocket.
Nothing to worry about.

23:13.757 --> 23:16.282
Objectives in sight.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.794
We peer down
the bomb sight.

23:18.862 --> 23:21.057
We're on target.

23:21.131 --> 23:24.828
We open
the bomb bay doors.

23:30.807 --> 23:34.334
We are getting
closer and closer.

23:34.411 --> 23:37.847
We are
approaching target.

23:37.915 --> 23:42.579
You're almost there.
Here we go, Donna. Here we go.

23:42.653 --> 23:45.554
Bombs away.

23:45.622 --> 23:48.591
Who's playing in
the cockpit? Goddamn it!

23:48.659 --> 23:51.184
- Mission scrubbed.
- Oh, Donna!

23:51.261 --> 23:54.059
Sorry to have to bail out, Loomis,
but it just won't work on the ground.

23:54.131 --> 23:56.691
I tried it in the simulator once.
It was no good there either.

23:56.767 --> 23:58.735
We've got to be airborne.

23:58.802 --> 24:01.202
But, Donna, listen.
We'll try a different flight plan.

24:01.271 --> 24:04.399
We are divebombing Tokio.

24:04.474 --> 24:08.069
I'd like to say
one final word about bombs.

24:08.145 --> 24:11.080
The eventuality of an air raid
on this city is highly unlikely.

24:11.148 --> 24:15.346
Oh, Donna. You can't do this
to me. You don't know what
I've been through today.

24:15.419 --> 24:18.286
Loomis, my father was a drill
sergeant in the Marine Corps.

24:18.355 --> 24:22.416
He taught me how to defend
myself. Now, leave me alone.

24:22.492 --> 24:25.518
Donna, please...

24:28.031 --> 24:31.398
As long as I am here,
I can assure you,

24:31.468 --> 24:34.232
there will be no bombs
dropped here.

24:47.851 --> 24:53.257
We think we've located
Captain Birkhead, sir.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.427
Okay, okay.

25:07.504 --> 25:09.995
Bye! See you later!

25:11.208 --> 25:13.836
Bye-bye!

25:13.910 --> 25:16.743
Maxine, I don't know why
I ever listen to you.

25:16.813 --> 25:20.544
I can't do this to Wally. You know
he's been waiting a long time for this.

25:20.617 --> 25:23.609
- He's even learning how to dance.
- Forget about Wally.

25:23.687 --> 25:26.247
Think of all those soldiers and sailors
we'll be dancing with tonight.

25:26.323 --> 25:29.724
I can't forget about Wally.

25:29.793 --> 25:32.990
What are you gonna do? Turn your back
on those brave men in uniform...

25:33.063 --> 25:35.088
so you can dance
with some criminal?

25:35.165 --> 25:38.828
Wally is not a criminal.
He's just... He's just original...

25:38.902 --> 25:41.962
- He stole your father's car.
That's really original.

25:42.039 --> 25:46.066
- Wally? What are you doing here?
- Betty?

25:46.143 --> 25:49.135
Oh, my God. If my father
catches you here, he'll kill you.

25:49.212 --> 25:54.013
I paid my debt to society. Your father
has a brand-new auto, a new garage.

25:54.084 --> 25:56.018
Did the fire insurance
pay for all this?

25:56.086 --> 25:59.647
My dad it can't possibly cover what he's
gonna do to you if he sees you again.

25:59.723 --> 26:04.251
I had to show you the new set of drapes
I picked up for the dance this evening.

26:04.328 --> 26:09.630
Look at this. A wreath pleat, a stuffed
cuff and a wreath sleeve. Snazzy, huh?

26:09.700 --> 26:13.796
- Watch these new steps!
- I have to talk to you.

26:13.870 --> 26:17.397
- Would you listen?
- You can forget
about the dance tonight.

26:17.474 --> 26:20.102
They won't let you near
the place dressed like that.

26:20.177 --> 26:22.941
It's a USO club now
for servicemen only.

26:23.013 --> 26:26.540
- And we're hostesses.
- What do you mean, "hostesses"?

26:26.616 --> 26:29.881
- That like a waitress?
- It means we can only dance
with servicemen.

26:29.953 --> 26:32.183
- Real men.
- What do you mean?

26:32.255 --> 26:35.656
You joined some organization that tells
you who you can and can't dance with?

26:35.726 --> 26:40.095
You're talking
about the USO!

26:40.163 --> 26:42.757
Where does that
leave us, Betty?

26:42.833 --> 26:46.269
Look, I know you don't
owe me anything.

26:46.336 --> 26:50.534
But I've been lookin' forward to this
night for a long, long time.

26:50.607 --> 26:53.201
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get a uniform.

26:53.276 --> 26:55.210
This is my uniform!

26:55.278 --> 26:58.941
I'm an American too, and there's
a lot of things I have to do.

26:59.015 --> 27:01.745
I have to do my part, Wally.

27:01.818 --> 27:04.048
There's a lot of Ionely
servicemen out there.

27:04.121 --> 27:08.387
- I don't want to see them
stuck on some German...
- Bayonet.

27:08.458 --> 27:11.655
Do you wanna go with me
tonight? Yes or no?

27:11.728 --> 27:13.320
- Yes.
- Betty.

27:13.397 --> 27:15.331
Think about those guys.

27:15.399 --> 27:18.197
I mean, no.
I mean, yes.

27:18.268 --> 27:20.566
The hairy chests
and the hairy arms...

27:20.637 --> 27:23.105
I don't know!
I don't know!

27:23.173 --> 27:26.438
You're gettin' me confused.

27:26.510 --> 27:28.569
I'm just confused.

27:28.645 --> 27:30.579
Oh, okay. Okay.

27:30.647 --> 27:32.581
Wait. Look.

27:32.649 --> 27:35.243
I'll meet ya in front
of the dance hall at 8:00.

27:35.318 --> 27:38.879
If they won't let me in,
we can go see a movie.

27:38.955 --> 27:43.517
Okay? There's that new
Walt Disney cartoon playin' around.

27:43.593 --> 27:44.924
Dumbo!

27:46.663 --> 27:50.531
Oh, my God.
Here comes my father.

27:52.936 --> 27:54.870
And he's got a gun!

27:54.938 --> 27:57.702
Quick, Wally. Go out the garage door.

27:57.774 --> 27:59.708
I'll stall him.

28:01.478 --> 28:05.642
Come on! Oh! Hello? Come on!

28:05.715 --> 28:07.740
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi. How are you?

28:07.818 --> 28:09.752
- Dad, I'd like you to meet my friend.
- Hi!

28:09.820 --> 28:10.946
It won't open!

28:11.021 --> 28:13.649
Dad, Dad,
I joined the USO.

28:13.723 --> 28:16.385
Yes, I know. You told me, dear.
We all got to do what we can.

28:27.037 --> 28:29.733
Aha!

28:38.148 --> 28:41.481
Shit. I didn't hear any gunshots.
He must have got away.

28:41.551 --> 28:43.815
What's that rug...
That's my hat!

28:43.887 --> 28:45.980
Gus, Gus, wait
'til they step on it.

28:46.056 --> 28:47.990
That's my brand-new hat.

28:54.698 --> 28:56.188
Surrender!

28:56.266 --> 29:00.259
- Macey Douglas,
what is the meaning of this?
- What is this?

29:00.337 --> 29:03.670
Jap trap. We're gonna cover it
over with sticks and stuff.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.265
Dad says when the Japs
sneak up, they'll fall in.

29:06.343 --> 29:09.506
I'm going to kill you.

29:09.579 --> 29:12.070
Wait 'til I get out of here,
I'm gonna murder you!

29:12.148 --> 29:14.918
You dug your own grave.

29:24.761 --> 29:27.229
Ward Douglas.

29:27.297 --> 29:31.666
Wow! Look what we're getting.

29:31.734 --> 29:35.363
I will not have guns
in this house.

29:36.472 --> 29:40.772
Uh, excuse us, ma'am.

29:40.843 --> 29:44.574
Heads up!

29:44.647 --> 29:47.480
Hello?

29:47.550 --> 29:49.984
Sorry, ma'am. Our gun
kind of got away on us there.

29:50.053 --> 29:52.783
- All right, move it back! Come on!
- Shit! Oh, sorry.

29:52.855 --> 29:55.119
Come on, move it out!
Back it up, ya foul-ups.

29:55.191 --> 29:58.160
Let's go, Reese.
Move it out easy now.

29:58.227 --> 30:00.195
Come on, Foley.
Get in here and push.

30:00.263 --> 30:04.723
- Gee whiz.
- Corporal Sitarski,
get on that wheel. Come on!

30:04.801 --> 30:06.735
All right.
Sitarski, lock it up!

30:07.804 --> 30:10.568
- Ow!
- Watch yourself.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.541
Attention, Foley,
Sitarski, Reese, let's go!

30:13.609 --> 30:15.577
Fall in on the double.
Hustle, hustle!

30:15.645 --> 30:18.739
Oh, my God!
My roses!

30:18.815 --> 30:21.909
Ten-hut! At ease.

30:21.985 --> 30:24.977
Sir, Sergeant Frank Tree, United States
Army Tenth Armored Division.

30:25.054 --> 30:28.217
Mr. Ward Herbert Douglas,
1313 Pelican Way?

30:28.291 --> 30:30.759
Yes.

30:30.827 --> 30:35.764
Uh-huh. The Coast Artillery Command
has determined your property...

30:35.832 --> 30:39.563
to be strategically advantageous
for the installation...

30:39.635 --> 30:42.069
of an enemy aircraft
defense battery.

30:42.138 --> 30:44.834
What?

30:44.907 --> 30:50.004
We want to put this 40 millimeter
antiaircraft gun in your yard, sir.

30:51.447 --> 30:54.746
Joan, they want to put
this gun in our yard.

30:54.817 --> 30:57.877
No. Absolutely not.
I refuse to let you...

30:57.954 --> 31:00.514
bring the war into
my own front yard.

31:00.590 --> 31:03.024
Joan. Joan dearest. Uh...

31:03.092 --> 31:06.357
That's the point, isn't it?
Whose front yard is this?

31:06.429 --> 31:11.093
Is it Tojo's front yard?
Is it Hirohito's front yard?
No. It's my front yard.

31:11.167 --> 31:15.035
It was bought and paid for
in the free marketplace.

31:15.104 --> 31:17.129
I am going to defend it.

31:17.206 --> 31:20.767
Then join the Civilian Defense.
You could become a block warden.

31:20.843 --> 31:25.337
I'm not going to run around like Angelo
Scioli with a whistle and flashlight,

31:25.415 --> 31:27.349
hollering, "Lights out."

31:29.919 --> 31:33.252
Calma! After the war,
I'll turn it back to a car.

31:33.322 --> 31:36.883
- Right now it's a tank
for the Civil Defense.
- Angelo.

31:38.961 --> 31:42.124
You promised me a lawn chair
on the beach...

31:42.198 --> 31:44.632
in front of Ward's house
with binoculars.

31:44.700 --> 31:48.568
That was originally. You still got
a chair. You still got binoculars.

31:48.638 --> 31:52.870
Only now you're on top of
the ferris wheel in the amusement park.

31:52.942 --> 31:54.876
You don't understand.

31:54.944 --> 31:58.345
I've got a little problem.

31:58.414 --> 32:00.974
I'm afraid of heights.
Yeah, yeah.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.678
Can't look down
from high up.

32:03.753 --> 32:05.846
What do you call that?
Hydrophobia?

32:05.922 --> 32:09.119
- Acrophobia.
- No problem. Won't bother ya.

32:09.192 --> 32:12.218
You never look down.
You just look up.

32:12.295 --> 32:15.822
You sit on top of the ferris wheel
with your binoculars spotting aircraft.

32:15.898 --> 32:19.698
- You never look down. Up, up, up...
- Who's with me?

32:19.769 --> 32:22.932
- Oh, I got a wonderful guy.
Very simpatico.
- Good man?

32:23.005 --> 32:25.997
Calm, cool,
collected, balanced.

32:26.075 --> 32:28.407
- He knows all about heights?
An expert?

32:28.478 --> 32:31.379
This person is an expert
about everything.

32:31.447 --> 32:33.574
Calma.

32:33.649 --> 32:36.914
That's not defense, Joan.
This is defense.

32:36.986 --> 32:40.945
- Ward, I have to talk...
- Sir, ma'am, please. Let's not fight.

32:41.023 --> 32:44.789
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's
seeing Americans fighting Americans.

32:44.861 --> 32:50.299
If you let them keep that gun
in our yard, our home will be a target.

32:50.366 --> 32:53.597
Joan, we're all targets
in this war.

32:53.669 --> 32:56.103
At least we will
be able to shoot back.

32:56.172 --> 32:59.005
- How do I work this thing, Sergeant?
- You shouldn't touch it.

32:59.075 --> 33:02.067
There will be a gunnery crew here
on Monday to man the ordnance.

33:02.145 --> 33:05.342
- Monday?
- Yes, sir.

33:05.414 --> 33:08.144
- Where will
they go to the bathroom?
- Oh.

33:08.217 --> 33:11.812
Remember I saw him first.
He's mine.

33:11.888 --> 33:14.356
I will not allow you
to bring the war into my front yard.

33:14.423 --> 33:17.324
Hello, hello, hello.

33:17.393 --> 33:20.556
Sitarski! Quit goldbrickin'!
Go in that garage,

33:20.630 --> 33:22.860
find a cement block and
stabilize that ordnance.

33:22.932 --> 33:24.866
- Move it!
- Yes, sir!

33:24.934 --> 33:29.803
- You heard your boss. Put me down.
- Anything you say, doll.

33:32.408 --> 33:35.935
- Come on, get the lead out!
Move, move, move!
- Yes, sir!

33:36.012 --> 33:39.470
Sergeant, there's no way this gun
can go off by itself, is there?

33:39.549 --> 33:42.109
Actually, I'm a motor pool
maintenance sergeant.

33:42.185 --> 33:44.119
I don't know too much
about the gunnery stuff.

33:44.187 --> 33:47.020
However, I can tell you this material
is a 40 millimeter automatic gun...

33:47.089 --> 33:49.057
effective against
low-flying aerial targets.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.423
The gun will displace a 1.96 pound,
high-explosive armor...

33:51.494 --> 33:53.894
Count to ten.

33:53.963 --> 33:58.593
One, two...

34:03.739 --> 34:07.800
How can we make sure that
the gun doesn't go off?

34:07.877 --> 34:11.108
The upper part of the gun
carriage is capable of...

34:11.179 --> 34:14.775
a full 360 degree traverse with a
maximum barrel elevation of 90 degrees.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.753
This is a cement block.

34:26.728 --> 34:29.197
Projectile at 2,960 feet per second...

34:33.002 --> 34:36.597
- Don't they teach you
manners in the Army?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

34:36.672 --> 34:41.005
I'm Corporal Chuck Sitarski,
United States Army.

34:42.578 --> 34:47.514
But, uh, my good friends
call me Stretch.

34:47.583 --> 34:51.882
How are ya? Aw, look,
I'm sorry I dropped you in that hole.

34:51.954 --> 34:54.388
Listen, you got a
little thing in your hair...

34:54.456 --> 34:57.358
I'll tell you what.
If it makes you feel any better,

34:57.426 --> 34:59.394
why don't you haul off
and slug me?

34:59.462 --> 35:03.796
- Plant one right here on my kisser.
- I don't want to hit you.

35:03.866 --> 35:08.235
- Make a fist.
- All right.

35:08.304 --> 35:10.238
You shouldn't touch
the ordnance at all.

35:10.306 --> 35:13.798
But more specifically, you should
never pull this hand-operating lever...

35:13.876 --> 35:15.810
- to the rear.
- Never.

35:15.878 --> 35:19.211
Do not push a clip of ammunition
down into the feed rollers here.

35:19.282 --> 35:21.307
- You would never put the ammunition...
- No, sir. Never.

35:21.384 --> 35:23.318
You never restore
this lever to firing position.

35:23.386 --> 35:25.854
Do not make sure that this cover
is completely closed.

35:25.921 --> 35:28.788
Never depress operator's
foot triggers here, here...

35:28.858 --> 35:30.792
- and at the rear here.
- Never.

35:30.860 --> 35:33.693
If an ordinary Joe
like me...

35:33.763 --> 35:37.130
went to one of those
fancy USO dances,

35:37.199 --> 35:40.691
and he saw an awful pretty
girl like you, and...

35:40.770 --> 35:42.829
And he wanted to ask her
to dance,

35:42.905 --> 35:45.703
- you think maybe she'd, uh, say, uh...
- Yes?

35:45.775 --> 35:48.710
Yeah.

35:50.079 --> 35:51.444
Don't listen
to that jerk!

35:51.514 --> 35:52.947
You!

35:53.015 --> 35:56.178
You!

35:56.252 --> 35:58.345
- You!
- You.

35:58.421 --> 36:03.358
You... have a really
serious wardrobe problem, kid.

36:03.426 --> 36:07.556
It's isn't fair!
No! No!

36:09.732 --> 36:13.793
Put me down! No! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

36:13.869 --> 36:18.033
I'm gonna be there at 8:00 in
front of the Crystal Ballroom.
I'll meet you there!

36:18.107 --> 36:20.667
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

36:20.743 --> 36:24.304
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

36:24.380 --> 36:28.117
No, you won't.

38:10.852 --> 38:14.310
Holly... wood...

38:24.900 --> 38:27.334
Hollywood.

38:27.402 --> 38:29.870
Hollywood...

38:29.938 --> 38:32.964
Tsk.

38:33.041 --> 38:36.909
Pinewood.

38:36.979 --> 38:39.846
Cheese!

38:39.915 --> 38:43.749
- Cheese!
- Okay.

38:43.819 --> 38:46.344
# Bring on your tough hoss #

38:46.421 --> 38:48.889
# You never had one #

38:48.957 --> 38:52.449
# That would set me
to guessin' or... #

38:54.029 --> 38:56.691
# Bother me none #

38:58.133 --> 39:02.763
# You've got that right
That's one thing I can do #

39:04.840 --> 39:08.640
# Says I got one
That's a bad one to bust #

39:08.710 --> 39:12.111
# He's been throwin' good riders
He's... # Whoa!

39:12.180 --> 39:14.876
Hey!

39:45.047 --> 39:50.542
Well, it's kind of skinny
around the bottom, but what the heck.

39:56.558 --> 39:59.083
Well, I'll be doggoned.

39:59.161 --> 40:01.994
Where'd you little bastards
come from?

40:02.064 --> 40:06.524
Thought you could hide
from old Holly, didn't ya?

40:06.601 --> 40:08.728
Doggone it.

40:08.804 --> 40:11.068
You get smaller every year.

40:12.140 --> 40:15.234
Oh, shoot!
Fire, fire, fire!

40:18.880 --> 40:21.280
Now, that's a nice one
right there.

40:21.350 --> 40:23.545
Yes, sir, that one there.

40:30.425 --> 40:34.555
I'm gonna have to
try that again.

40:40.435 --> 40:44.804
Whoa! Jesus palomino!
Walkin' trees!

40:53.482 --> 40:56.110
Holly... wood.

40:56.184 --> 41:00.348
Hollywood.
Hollywood!

41:00.422 --> 41:02.822
Banzai! Banzai!

41:20.776 --> 41:24.177
Uh-huh. I'm lost.

41:31.887 --> 41:35.084
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

41:35.157 --> 41:36.818
Oooh!

41:48.570 --> 41:52.062
Huh?

41:52.140 --> 41:55.007
Huh?

41:59.181 --> 42:01.877
Oh.

42:01.950 --> 42:03.975
Ah.

42:05.253 --> 42:08.279
# The stars at night
are big and bright #

42:10.358 --> 42:12.292
# Deep in
the heart of Texas #

42:15.464 --> 42:17.432
Starved.

42:17.499 --> 42:19.433
Can opener!

42:30.779 --> 42:34.306
Ha-ha! Ho-ho!
Ha-ha!

42:35.417 --> 42:37.510
Does that gun work?

42:37.586 --> 42:39.520
You ain't gonna shoot nobody,
are ya?

42:39.588 --> 42:42.716
You ought to get some oil on that thing.
You shouldn't leave it settin' out.

42:42.791 --> 42:45.726
- Down there?
What is it? A Winchester?

42:45.794 --> 42:47.762
That's what I got,
a Winchester.

42:47.829 --> 42:50.491
Lever action,
shoots like a house on fire.

42:50.565 --> 42:54.467
You ought to try to pick one up...
Don't go stepping on me.

42:54.536 --> 42:57.403
Ought to try to pick one up
while you're over here.

42:57.472 --> 42:59.736
Damn good gun.

43:01.743 --> 43:03.677
Ah!

43:14.022 --> 43:17.890
You sneaky little bastards ain't
gettin' doodily shit outta me,

43:17.959 --> 43:21.986
except maybe my name, rank
and social security number.

43:22.063 --> 43:25.965
Wood, Hollis P.
Lumberjack.

43:26.034 --> 43:30.061
Social security: 1-0-6...

43:30.138 --> 43:33.574
4-3... 2-1-8-5.

43:37.679 --> 43:39.613
Where Hollywood?

43:39.681 --> 43:42.309
- Right here.
- What?

43:42.384 --> 43:44.852
You're lookin' at him.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.582
- Who?
- Hollis Wood.

43:47.656 --> 43:49.988
Where?

43:50.058 --> 43:54.017
I'm right here. Shoot.
Can't ya understand plain English?

43:54.095 --> 43:56.928
- Hollywood?
- Huh?

43:56.998 --> 43:59.125
- Where?
- Here!

44:02.604 --> 44:06.233
Look. Where Hollywood?

44:06.308 --> 44:08.469
North? South?

44:08.543 --> 44:13.412
Oh. You want me to tell you
where Hollywood is.

44:13.481 --> 44:16.143
Well, shoot. That's easy.
Hollywood is right...

44:22.791 --> 44:24.759
Oh, no, you don't.

44:24.826 --> 44:30.025
You thought you was gonna get me to show
you where Hollywood was, didn't ya?

44:30.098 --> 44:34.626
Tried to sneak up on me
like ya did Pearl Harbor!

44:34.703 --> 44:37.297
Bet you're gonna bomb
John Wayne's house, ain't ya?

44:37.372 --> 44:39.966
- John Wayne-o?
- I knew it!

44:40.041 --> 44:44.273
I knew it. I ain't gonna tell ya
one stinkin' thing.

44:44.346 --> 44:46.814
You can torture me,
do anything you want to.

44:46.881 --> 44:50.578
Jesus palomino.

44:50.652 --> 44:53.621
A Nazi!
I knew it!

44:53.688 --> 44:56.020
You're all in cahoots!

44:56.091 --> 45:00.494
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Heinie Kraut,

45:00.562 --> 45:03.053
I fought your kind
in the great war.

45:03.131 --> 45:06.692
And we kicked
the livin' shit outta ya.

45:06.768 --> 45:09.794
# Over there, over there #

45:09.871 --> 45:12.362
# Send the word
Send the word over there #

45:12.440 --> 45:17.173
- # That the Yanks are comin'
The Huns are runnin' ##

45:20.115 --> 45:24.074
Hey! What do ya go
tearin' up my radio for?

45:24.152 --> 45:26.780
What's the big idea?

45:28.988 --> 45:32.219
All right. Go ahead
and search me if you want to.

45:35.461 --> 45:40.125
One genuine American
jackrabbit foot.

45:43.603 --> 45:48.131
One authentic early American
hari-kari knife.

45:48.207 --> 45:53.110
Pass it around, boys. Maybe
somebody's got a use for it.

45:53.179 --> 45:56.910
One ten-cent box
of delicious,

45:56.983 --> 46:01.113
nutritious,
caramel-coated Popperjacks.

46:03.656 --> 46:06.250
Doggone it,
this is my stuff.

46:18.137 --> 46:21.664
Compass.

46:38.024 --> 46:41.619
Banzai, my balls...

46:49.435 --> 46:53.064
Let's see you try and find
Hollywood now, you scrawny little...

46:53.139 --> 46:56.370
Hey, boy, watch that knife.

47:10.456 --> 47:13.118
Prune juice.

47:13.192 --> 47:17.094
Oh, no, you don't! Aah!

47:34.180 --> 47:36.148
Oh, boy, rides!

47:36.215 --> 47:38.911
- It'll be okay. Don't worry.
- I don't know, Angelo.

47:38.985 --> 47:41.818
- What if my nose bleeds?
- Use a handkerchief.

47:41.887 --> 47:45.186
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. A ferris wheel.

47:45.257 --> 47:48.590
I love ferris wheels.
Do we get to ride this all night?

47:48.661 --> 47:50.595
Just to the end
of the shift.

47:50.663 --> 47:53.996
We don't have to pay for this, do we?
We're working for the government now.

47:54.066 --> 47:56.660
Don't worry, Herb.
You don't pay for nothin'.

47:56.736 --> 47:59.000
Is that where
you turn it on?

47:59.071 --> 48:02.438
I always wanted to work
one of these babies.

48:04.443 --> 48:07.276
"Warning: Do not...

48:07.346 --> 48:09.940
turn on switch."

48:10.016 --> 48:11.950
Ow! Hey!

48:12.018 --> 48:16.148
Don't touch that.
These are the master control switches.

48:16.222 --> 48:20.022
You fool around with them,
you turn on the whole amusement park.

48:22.094 --> 48:26.656
- I love ferris wheels.
- Relax, Claude.
Everything's gonna be all right.

48:26.732 --> 48:29.223
Here's what you gotta do.

48:29.301 --> 48:35.035
If you hear or see any airplanes,
you pick up the phone,

48:35.107 --> 48:38.599
you yell, "Army flash!"

48:38.677 --> 48:41.737
- You got a direct line to
the Interceptor Command.
- Hey!

48:41.814 --> 48:45.807
Then you tell them exactly
what ya saw and where. Here.

48:45.885 --> 48:50.447
You know my problem with heights.
I don't want to be
stuck up there with him.

48:50.523 --> 48:54.050
Jesus Christ, Angelo.
They gave him a gun.

48:54.126 --> 48:56.458
Don't worry. He got a license.
He's an expert shot.

48:56.529 --> 48:59.225
Don't worry.
Try to adjust to him.

48:59.298 --> 49:01.926
- To know him is to love him.
- Ow!

49:02.001 --> 49:04.731
Don't worry.
You'll both be compatible.

49:04.804 --> 49:07.773
If not, I'll get you a replacement.
Just sit down, Claude.

49:07.840 --> 49:11.367
Remember, you're both
very vital to Civil Defense.

49:13.479 --> 49:16.141
Safety bar?
We don't need no safety bar.

49:16.215 --> 49:18.945
What happens
if we have to jump?

49:19.018 --> 49:21.748
You keep the safety bar
locked at all times.

49:21.821 --> 49:25.450
And remember, don't act up, Herbie,
like you did last summer.

49:25.524 --> 49:28.584
No standing up
and no rocking.

49:28.661 --> 49:32.097
You mean this thing
rocks? Whoa!

49:32.164 --> 49:34.962
Whoa! Whoa!

49:35.034 --> 49:37.264
Don't worry.
You're perfectly safe.

49:37.336 --> 49:40.305
Like a baby in its mother's arms.
You got nothin' to worry about.

49:40.372 --> 49:43.899
I once swung around in
one of these things 180 degrees
and I didn't get hurt.

49:43.976 --> 49:46.945
No, sir, buddy. There's no way
you can get killed in one of these,

49:47.012 --> 49:49.139
unless you really try.

49:49.215 --> 49:51.775
Like this one guy I knew.
He committed suicide.

49:51.851 --> 49:54.081
He just stood up and did
a swan dive straight down.

49:54.153 --> 49:57.122
Sit down, please.
Just stay seated, please.

49:57.189 --> 49:59.919
Don't look down, Claude.
You'll be all right.

49:59.992 --> 50:05.123
Up, up, up. I'll be back to pick you up
after your shift. Ciao.

50:12.771 --> 50:14.864
Hey, this
grapefruit's rotten.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.034
I'm gonna throw it away.
Is it all right with you?

50:18.110 --> 50:20.044
All right, I'm gonna
throw it away.

50:20.112 --> 50:23.980
Here it goes.
It's going. It's going.

50:24.049 --> 50:26.108
It's going. It's going.

50:26.185 --> 50:29.484
Going. It's going.
It's going.

50:30.389 --> 50:32.323
Too bad I forgot
to time it.

50:32.391 --> 50:34.951
If I'd timed it, I would have known
how long it took to hit the ground.

50:35.027 --> 50:37.621
Because objects fall
at 32 feet per second.

50:37.696 --> 50:40.256
Would you just shut up
about heights?

50:40.332 --> 50:43.392
I don't want to hear
another word about heights.

50:47.039 --> 50:50.372
- Boy, I sure hope the wind starts...
- Just shut up!

50:50.442 --> 50:54.640
Now don't say
another word.

51:07.393 --> 51:10.021
Scared of heights, huh?
Ha, ha, ha! Me too.

51:31.584 --> 51:34.451
You ain't gettin'
shit outta me.

51:34.520 --> 51:39.082
I've been constipated all week and
there ain't a damn thing you can do.

51:50.336 --> 51:52.395
Now wait a minute, General!

51:52.471 --> 51:55.406
I'm doin'
the best I can.

51:55.474 --> 51:59.638
You gotta tell these guys
that I gotta have more privacy.

51:59.712 --> 52:03.341
How in the hell do you expect a guy
to take a bowel movement...

52:03.415 --> 52:07.351
with a bunch of buffalo rifles
a- pointin' at 'im?

52:07.419 --> 52:10.980
I have enough problems
just pissin' in a public restroom.

52:53.666 --> 52:56.601
Hmph!

53:16.355 --> 53:20.451
Ahh!

53:24.496 --> 53:29.024
Huh?

53:34.807 --> 53:38.243
All right, you!

53:53.659 --> 53:55.923
Get outta my way!

53:55.994 --> 53:58.519
God bless America!

53:58.597 --> 54:00.565
Hey!

54:00.632 --> 54:04.591
Let go of my foot,
you son of a bitch you!

54:15.414 --> 54:19.214
Which way's the damn beach?
Oh, shit!

54:36.802 --> 54:39.999
Detail, assume defense positions
on the double!

54:40.072 --> 54:43.633
- All right, move!
Clear all civilians outta here!

54:46.078 --> 54:48.103
No civilians tonight.
Get 'em back.

54:48.180 --> 54:51.445
Get 'em out there.
Keep 'em back.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.953
Ah. Dumbo.

54:58.023 --> 55:00.958
Sure be good to get my mind
off things for a while.

55:11.203 --> 55:14.138
Come on, I don't
want to miss Dumbo.

55:14.206 --> 55:17.642
General Stilwell, sir,
an urgent message from Barstow!

55:17.709 --> 55:21.304
- From Colonel Maddox, son?
- Sir, they're worried about an invasion.

55:21.379 --> 55:25.816
Christ, I thought I told Maddox
to hold his position.
Birkhead, see what he wants.

55:25.884 --> 55:29.820
I'm sorry, sir. My orders
are to give these directly to you.

55:37.729 --> 55:40.664
"Request relief column.
Invasion imminent.

55:40.732 --> 55:44.293
Murderers parachuting in
from the skies."

55:46.371 --> 55:49.306
Son, are these Jap murderers
or Kraut murderers?

55:49.374 --> 55:51.467
The colonel
didn't specify, sir.

55:51.543 --> 55:53.534
You seen
these murderers, son?

55:53.612 --> 55:58.049
Um, no, sir. But Colonel Maddox has
seen lights in the hills after dark.

55:58.116 --> 56:02.052
This leads the colonel to believe
they're being dropped in at night, sir.

56:05.690 --> 56:07.624
You know, son,

56:07.692 --> 56:10.593
Colonel Maddox is mad.

56:12.397 --> 56:14.331
He is?

56:14.399 --> 56:16.697
I'm getting that old
sinking feeling.

56:16.768 --> 56:19.703
Excuse me, General, but
since it's a bombing range,

56:19.771 --> 56:22.706
don't you think Colonel Maddox
would have some planes there, sir?

56:22.774 --> 56:24.708
Some airplanes.

56:24.776 --> 56:27.768
Yeah, well, he might have
a few planes there. So what?

56:27.846 --> 56:30.781
Well, I seem to recall
a huge stockpile of bombs, sir.

56:30.849 --> 56:33.784
Stock... I'm missing the movie.
I'm missing the movie!

56:33.852 --> 56:37.151
Considering Maddox's state of mind,
there's no telling what he might do.

56:37.222 --> 56:39.554
I thought it might be wise
if I take a jaunt out there...

56:39.624 --> 56:41.956
and see if I can't appease
the girl... uh, the colonel, sir.

56:42.027 --> 56:43.961
With your permission,
of course.

56:44.029 --> 56:46.964
Take my car, go out there
and keep that maniac at bay.

56:47.032 --> 56:49.967
- And don't let him get
his hands on an airplane.
- Yes, sir!

56:50.035 --> 56:53.971
Sir, I'm going to take
a rain check on the movie.
I've got a splitting headache.

56:54.039 --> 56:57.475
I'm sorry about your headache.
Can I call a car for you?

56:57.542 --> 57:01.911
- No, sir, I think I can persuade
Capt. Birkhead to give me...
- Can I have my ticket?

57:01.980 --> 57:05.416
Loomis, use your head. Everybody knows
you flunked out of flight school.

57:05.483 --> 57:08.543
Trust me,
it'll never get that far.

57:17.896 --> 57:20.490
Whoa!

57:26.071 --> 57:28.005
If we don't paint
the windows,

57:28.073 --> 57:31.668
these lights will shine
over the water 30, 40 miles.

57:31.743 --> 57:35.975
You know, we could get new curtains.
I wouldn't mind that.

57:36.047 --> 57:40.916
That nice soldier said we could get
blackout curtains at Sears Roebuck.

57:40.986 --> 57:43.921
I wouldn't mind
redoing this whole room.

57:43.989 --> 57:46.924
Since Mama died I wouldn't mind
redoing the whole house.

57:46.992 --> 57:49.927
Knock down a few walls.
What do you think?

57:49.995 --> 57:51.963
Somebody should do
something.

57:52.030 --> 57:56.729
- Macey Douglas, will you please
take your gas mask off!

57:56.801 --> 58:00.737
- You know that is no way
to eat your soup!

58:02.007 --> 58:05.033
But Mom,
he likes it that way.

58:05.110 --> 58:08.546
- The lima beans can get through.
- Ward.

58:10.615 --> 58:14.642
- Mom? Dad?
I'm leaving now.
- Green pig.

58:14.753 --> 58:18.154
- Have a good time.
- Betty, just a minute, um...

58:18.223 --> 58:21.522
- Look at you.
- Come in the living room. Let's...

58:21.593 --> 58:24.528
- Let's have a little talk.
- Don't ever do this again.

58:24.596 --> 58:27.531
We've never really had a...
a talk, have we, Betty?

58:27.599 --> 58:30.534
A father-daughter
kind of a talk.

58:31.603 --> 58:33.730
Betty,

58:35.307 --> 58:38.743
you know, I'm too old
to be in this war.

58:38.810 --> 58:42.246
The boys, Macey, the others,
they're too young.

58:42.314 --> 58:44.248
It's up to you.

58:44.316 --> 58:48.252
I don't know what they
told you at the USO,

58:48.320 --> 58:52.086
but you're going to be meeting
a lot of strange... men.

58:53.224 --> 58:55.158
Men in uniform.

58:57.228 --> 59:00.163
Boys a long way from home.
Lonely, desperate.

59:01.733 --> 59:04.668
They really have one thing
on their minds.

59:06.805 --> 59:08.739
Show 'em
a good time.

59:13.978 --> 59:15.878
All right, you lovers!

59:15.947 --> 59:19.474
You can quit gettin' all dolled up.
We're not goin' to any dance.

59:19.551 --> 59:22.486
- What?
- We've just been posted
on combat readiness.

59:22.554 --> 59:25.489
- Combat readiness?
- We gotta play wet nurse
to Lulabelle tonight.

59:25.557 --> 59:28.424
Combat readiness?
Sarge, this is Hollywood!

59:28.493 --> 59:32.429
Hollywood, is it, Foley?
I guess they didn't tell you
Lana Turner's coming by...

59:32.497 --> 59:34.431
to keep us all
company tonight.

59:34.499 --> 59:36.433
Where's Sitarski?
That goldbrick!

59:36.501 --> 59:39.436
If he went AWOL,
I'll ream his ass!

59:39.504 --> 59:41.438
Hey, Sitarski,
you meatball!

59:46.010 --> 59:47.944
This here right here.

59:48.012 --> 59:50.947
I want that there bunk
right there by the door!

59:51.015 --> 59:53.950
I don't want none of them
Asian enemies sneakin' up on me...

59:54.018 --> 59:55.952
while I'm in here
asleep!

59:56.020 --> 59:57.954
My name is
Ogden Johnson Jones.

59:58.022 --> 01:00:02.584
I ain't gonna enjoy it here, but I got
orders that say I's supposed to be here.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:06.596
And orders is orders. Is there
anybody in here that don't like it?

01:00:06.664 --> 01:00:09.599
Gimme a jar of that
white stencil paint.

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:13.103
Now then, Ogden,
I know you're gonna like it here.

01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:15.605
There's a few rules
you gotta abide by.

01:00:15.673 --> 01:00:18.608
For example, down here, sir,
you'll notice...

01:00:18.676 --> 01:00:21.611
this white line, which is
the Mason-Dixon line.

01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:25.809
That is the north; this is the south.
Don't ever cross over there.

01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:29.820
Well, I'm from Tennessee and I'm
goin' home to visit my relatives.

01:00:29.888 --> 01:00:33.449
That's always nice, but this
is Mississippi. Don't ever cross there.

01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:37.461
- Yeah? Well, I wanna
pick magnolia flowers.
- Oh-ho! Magnolias, you say.

01:00:37.529 --> 01:00:40.965
Well, you wouldn't dare
cross the Mexican border, would you?

01:00:41.032 --> 01:00:44.468
- Well, hola and a si, si, si to you.
- Ah, I knows!

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.970
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk! White flag.
I surrender. Bye-bye.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.509
- It never fails, you know.
Those guys are idiots.
- Aaaah!

01:00:57.382 --> 01:01:01.580
Hey, what's happenin'?

01:01:01.653 --> 01:01:05.487
- Wally!
- Wally!

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.585
- What?
- Hey.

01:01:10.662 --> 01:01:14.098
- They won't let nobody in
without no uniform.
- Seen Betty in there?

01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:16.099
We only been here
ten minutes.

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:19.102
Go get 'em, Wally!

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:22.606
Who the hell are you supposed to be,
the admiral of the Hollywood navy?

01:01:22.674 --> 01:01:25.905
- I'm lookin' for somebody.
- How 'bout lookin' for
a size 10 up your ass, huh?

01:01:27.912 --> 01:01:31.348
- Say, Wally, it's time to
throw some chingazos!
- Orale, Wally!

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.350
- Oh, no.
- Hi.

01:01:33.418 --> 01:01:35.352
- Hi.
- You know what?

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.856
You got a lot of balls comin'
here tonight. You know why?

01:01:38.923 --> 01:01:42.290
'Cause when I get through with you,
you ain't gonna have none left.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.056
Hit him! Hit him!

01:01:45.129 --> 01:01:47.791
Hit the dude, Wally.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.970
Hey. ¿Como esta?
¿Que pasa?

01:02:00.044 --> 01:02:03.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:03.481 --> 01:02:05.415
Listen,
I'll tell you what.

01:02:05.483 --> 01:02:08.884
Since I'm obviously interrupting
something important,

01:02:08.953 --> 01:02:11.251
he's all yours.

01:02:13.825 --> 01:02:16.760
- Poor bastard.
- I smell something burning.

01:02:16.828 --> 01:02:19.763
Yeah, it smells like garbage.

01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:22.265
Aaah! Aaah!

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:25.769
- Look, lady, I've had it up
to here about my clothes!
- Aaaaah!

01:02:25.837 --> 01:02:28.772
Wally! You're on fire!

01:02:33.912 --> 01:02:35.846
Ooh! Aah!
Ohh!

01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:41.851
Thank you.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.354
Break it up.

01:02:44.422 --> 01:02:46.356
Wally!

01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:51.562
- I have to talk to you.
- Wally, do you smell garbage burning?

01:02:51.629 --> 01:02:54.564
- Would you excuse us, sir?
- I wanna apologize for this afternoon.

01:02:54.632 --> 01:02:57.567
- We have nothing to talk about now.
- Sir, we're late for the dance.

01:02:57.635 --> 01:03:01.071
Don't go in there with him.
I know him. I know what he's like.

01:03:01.139 --> 01:03:03.940
Miss Douglas? Allow me.

01:03:12.081 --> 01:03:15.050
# Down by the Ohio #

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:20.145
# I've got the cutest
sweetest oh-my-oh #

01:03:20.222 --> 01:03:24.181
- # He's just a country boy
who works around farms #
- Wally's in the street!

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.694
- # But he has his charms #
- What?
- Hey!

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:28.696
- You wanna dance?
- No!

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.891
- You... You wanna dance?
- No!

01:03:36.973 --> 01:03:38.907
Aah!

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:42.744
- Look, you, it's...
- Wally!

01:03:42.812 --> 01:03:45.747
- Dennis, what the...
- What are you doin'?
That guy's a killer!

01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:48.750
- What have you got on?
- These uniforms work
like a son of a bitch!

01:03:48.818 --> 01:03:51.252
Come on, Dennis, let's dance!

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.255
- I don't believe it! You joined up?
- No!

01:03:54.323 --> 01:03:56.416
Wally, look. Western Costumes.
Just two dollars.

01:03:58.494 --> 01:04:01.429
- Care for a drink, Betty?
Gimme a couple of Cokes.

01:04:01.497 --> 01:04:03.931
- I'm not hungry.
- Couple of donuts too.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.798
Hey, you devil,
how about a deviled egg?

01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:09.303
- Oh, no, I hate eggs.
- My grandmother made 'em.

01:04:09.372 --> 01:04:11.806
- Would you care to dance?
- Yes.

01:04:11.874 --> 01:04:13.808
Excuse us, please.
Listen.

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:16.811
That... is my
port of entry.

01:04:16.879 --> 01:04:19.814
Believe me, walk away.
Just walk away.

01:04:19.882 --> 01:04:21.850
I'm wa... I'm walking away.
I'm walking.

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:25.648
- # They're just very ordinary #
- Your donut, Betty.

01:04:25.721 --> 01:04:27.655
- # By that I mean #
- I'll get it.

01:04:27.723 --> 01:04:30.658
- # Those heartbreakers
haven't a chance #
- Wanna cut a rug with me?

01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:34.662
- Maybe have a little
pick-me-up. We could...
- # With my new romance #

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.255
- # Down by the old Ohio #
- Maybe later.

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:41.269
# That's where I found him
I've got the cutest oh-my-oh #

01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:44.363
Betty, I think it's getting
a little crowded around here.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.375
Why don't we go and dance?

01:04:47.443 --> 01:04:50.674
# And jumpin'
jeepers creepers #

01:04:50.746 --> 01:04:53.010
- # When I'm in his arms #
- That's the man for me.

01:04:53.082 --> 01:04:56.415
# I get so oh-my-oh #

01:04:56.485 --> 01:04:57.975
# He is the only... #

01:05:00.056 --> 01:05:02.616
- Aaah!
- #... me so #

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:07.128
- # He knows his chickens
and his cabbages too #

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.695
# He's got that oh-my-oh
Oh-hi, oh-my #

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:20.208
# Just wait 'til I get back
to O-hi-o #

01:05:45.167 --> 01:05:48.102
# Baby mine #

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:52.766
# Don't you cry #

01:05:52.842 --> 01:05:56.073
# Baby mine #

01:05:56.145 --> 01:06:00.411
# Dry your eyes #

01:06:00.483 --> 01:06:05.716
# Rest your head
close to my heart #

01:06:05.788 --> 01:06:09.189
# Never to part, baby of... ##

01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:11.852
It sure is dark
out here, huh?

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:14.862
You look out the windows,
you can't see a thing.

01:06:16.932 --> 01:06:19.901
This is just like
flying at night.

01:06:19.969 --> 01:06:23.405
It's sure a helluva lot
safer than flying at night.

01:06:23.472 --> 01:06:28.307
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear we were flying.
This car feels like a plane.

01:06:28.377 --> 01:06:31.312
- Hey, what does this feel like?
- Loomis.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.315
Forward thrust? Donna,
doesn't that feel like forward thrust?

01:06:34.383 --> 01:06:36.317
- You're such a child.
- Yeah.

01:06:36.385 --> 01:06:38.319
I'll tell you what.

01:06:38.387 --> 01:06:43.450
You get me up in an airplane and then
we'll talk about forward thrust.

01:06:48.864 --> 01:06:52.823
- # He knows his chickens
and his cabbages too #
- What's your real name, Sal?

01:06:52.902 --> 01:06:55.336
# But where the dickens did
he learn to "woo-woo" #

01:06:55.404 --> 01:06:57.338
- Raoul.
- I knew it.

01:06:57.406 --> 01:06:58.896
Lipschitz.

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:01.534
# Just wait 'til
I get back to #

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.979
# O-hi-o #

01:07:06.048 --> 01:07:08.312
# You may think
you've seen #

01:07:08.384 --> 01:07:10.818
# Lovers on the screen #

01:07:10.886 --> 01:07:14.879
# They're just very ordinary
By that I mean #

01:07:14.957 --> 01:07:19.417
# Those heartbreakers
haven't a chance #

01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:22.487
- # 'Gainst my new romance #
- Betty!
- Wally!

01:07:22.565 --> 01:07:24.795
Betty!

01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:28.303
- # Down by the old Ohio
That's where I found him #
- Wally!

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:31.305
- # I've got the cutest oh-my-oh #
- Hey, come on!

01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:35.309
You'll never drink in here again,
you drunken son of a bitch!

01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:45.053
# I get so oh-my-oh #

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.988
# He is the only one
who ever thrilled me so #

01:07:49.058 --> 01:07:51.652
They want no drunks
botherin' and grabbin' em.

01:07:51.727 --> 01:07:55.288
# He knows his chickens
and his cabbages too #

01:07:55.364 --> 01:07:59.664
All right? I'm sorry.

01:07:59.735 --> 01:08:02.670
- # He's got my oh-my-oh
Oh-my-oh-my #

01:08:02.738 --> 01:08:04.672
- # Just wait 'til I get back #
- No drinking!

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.766
- # To O-hi-o ##
- I'm sorry.

01:08:07.843 --> 01:08:10.209
No!

01:08:12.948 --> 01:08:16.884
- Ladies and gentlemen, may I
please have your attention?

01:08:16.952 --> 01:08:18.886
Attention, please,
everyone.

01:08:18.953 --> 01:08:21.388
Listen up now, everyone.
All right.

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:23.687
Meyer,
come on up here.

01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:25.693
- # Hey, listen #
- All right.

01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:29.197
- The jitterbug contest
is about to begin.

01:08:29.265 --> 01:08:33.201
And now I'm going to introduce
our judge for the contest,

01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:35.703
Mr. Meyer Mishkin
of RKO Pictures!

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.365
RKO Pictures!

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:42.433
- Meyer is an agent
at RKO Pictures and he's...
- Uh, talent scout.

01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:44.444
Talent scout.
All right.

01:08:44.513 --> 01:08:46.947
Tell them about
first prize, huh?

01:08:47.015 --> 01:08:49.951
Uh, first prize is a seven-year
contract at RKO Pictures.

01:08:50.019 --> 01:08:52.385
Seven years! Did you hear that?

01:08:52.453 --> 01:08:56.390
- Let's get outta here so
these slobs can't bother us.

01:08:56.457 --> 01:08:59.654
You wanna dance with me?
I'm in the USO! I'll dance with you!

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.870
Sailor, please!

01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:11.872
Let's get outta here.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.738
I don't wanna go!

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.745
Ladies and gentlemen, I want you
to count down with me...

01:09:17.813 --> 01:09:19.747
on this momentous,
tremendous,

01:09:19.814 --> 01:09:21.544
absolutely pretty...
important occasion.

01:09:21.617 --> 01:09:23.551
All right.

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:28.881
- We can't go yet. You wanna dance?
- Sure, dolly.

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:32.358
- And...
- Ten!

01:09:32.428 --> 01:09:34.895
- What the hell are you... Hey!
- Nine!

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.897
You crazy
son of a bitch!

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:40.560
- Please.
- Seven!
- Help me.

01:09:40.636 --> 01:09:42.331
- Gimme a break.
- Six! Five!

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:44.337
- A what?
- Gimme a break!

01:09:44.406 --> 01:09:45.872
Time!

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:48.202
- Four!
- Please.

01:09:48.277 --> 01:09:50.541
- Three!
- Aaah!

01:09:50.612 --> 01:09:52.636
- Two!
- Wait for me, Stretch!

01:09:52.715 --> 01:09:54.410
One!

01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:57.316
And grab your partner
and take it away!

01:09:57.386 --> 01:10:00.321
Wait for me, Stretch!

01:10:04.793 --> 01:10:08.889
- Wally!
- Wait a minute, Betty!
We gotta dance!

01:10:24.713 --> 01:10:27.580
Aah!

01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:29.583
Ohh!

01:10:37.593 --> 01:10:39.527
Look out!

01:10:45.734 --> 01:10:48.294
Stretch!

01:11:13.796 --> 01:11:15.730
Watch it!

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.668
Stretch!

01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:23.035

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.333

Get awa... Aah!

Ooh, Stretch.

Whoa!

01:11:49.899 --> 01:11:52.561
Aaah!
