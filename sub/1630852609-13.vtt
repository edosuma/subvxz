WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.956
you're only getting
half the story.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.625
Director:
Break on the main stage.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.460
All cameras re-po.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.062
RuPaul: Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.198
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

00:31.198 --> 00:33.166
the judges and I
will deliberate.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.369
You may leave the stage.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.810
Baby, I'm so happy
after the roast.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.647
I got pretty good critiques
from the judges.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.949
Hey, I'll take it.

00:48.949 --> 00:54.554
Unfortunately, I think
I will be in the bottom.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.756
I'm feeling nervous.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.926
I'm, like, is this my time?

00:58.926 --> 01:01.662
I'm honestly really
disappointed in myself,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.297
but not gonna lie.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.899
I feel so relieved
that I got through it.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.869
I'm at peace
with whatever happens.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.672
All cameras up.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.140
Copy that. Here we go.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.841
We got the queens walking.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.611
-Aah!
-Whew, girl.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.614
-Ugh!
-♪ Doo doo doo-doo, doo-doo ♪

01:20.614 --> 01:22.616
-Can I take the pink one?
-Yeah.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.384
Oh-oh-oh.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.719
Oh, gosh.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.987
Aah!

01:26.987 --> 01:29.156
-Gather 'round, ladies.
-Gathering.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.358
So let's address
the elephant in the room.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.626
Oh, my God.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.027
I know I will be lip syncing.

01:34.027 --> 01:37.064
I feel like
they almost were insulted

01:37.064 --> 01:40.067
that I did not listen to them,

01:40.067 --> 01:42.936
even though I feel like
I did take their direction.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.539
I more or less
was under the impression

01:45.539 --> 01:48.809
that it was like if you feel
like it would land, do it.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.378
But I just hate the feeling

01:51.378 --> 01:53.413
of, like, I feel like
I almost insulted them,

01:53.413 --> 01:55.749
because neither of them
were really pleased,

01:55.749 --> 01:57.084
Dulcé and Michelle,

01:57.084 --> 01:58.952
and I almost slightly felt
like they were just, like,

01:58.952 --> 02:00.087
why the fuck didn't--

02:00.087 --> 02:02.789
without saying it--
I kind of felt that way.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.192
You didn't take any of me
and Michelle's notes.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.360
Me and Michelle
didn't get dressed

02:06.360 --> 02:08.362
just to not have somebody
listen to us.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.297
Even your opening joke,
we said mm-mm,

02:10.297 --> 02:12.099
and you opened with it anyway.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.603
So I definitely know
I'm gonna be lip syncing,

02:16.603 --> 02:18.271
and the person
I'm gonna be lip syncing to

02:18.271 --> 02:21.108
is, like, my fucking bitch,
ride or die.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.512
You okay, babe?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.819
I just feel stupid,

02:32.819 --> 02:35.889
because I feel like

02:35.889 --> 02:38.125
they're constantly
seeing something in me

02:38.125 --> 02:41.795
that I'm not able
to bring to life.

02:41.795 --> 02:46.533
So I just feel dumb.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.369
I do not wanna lip sync
against my sister,

02:49.369 --> 02:52.039
and I don't think she wants
to lip sync against me neither.

02:52.039 --> 02:55.609
It sucks because, like,
when someone's close to me,

02:55.609 --> 02:57.377
it hurts to the core.

02:57.377 --> 03:00.547
Because it's difficult.

03:00.547 --> 03:01.915
It really is hard

03:01.915 --> 03:04.851
because your mindset
is "focus on me,"

03:04.851 --> 03:06.219
but at the same time,

03:06.219 --> 03:09.790
I wanna, you know,
make sure everyone's okay.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.258
And then it keeps
running through my mind,

03:11.258 --> 03:13.226
because I know we're gonna have
to lip sync against each other.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.928
Um...

03:17.230 --> 03:19.399
I just don't want
to let anyone down,

03:19.399 --> 03:24.571
and I felt like today I just
let all of the judges down.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.473
Girl, this challenge
was fucking hard.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.774
It's difficult.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.876
Not everyone can fucking
do that, you know what I mean?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.813
Like, bitch, sitting down
in your own thoughts,

03:32.813 --> 03:34.014
in your own head,

03:34.014 --> 03:36.349
it's just, like,
you're your worst critic.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.519
Under a lot of pressure,
it's hard to focus.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.322
I will say, like,
now that it's over,

03:42.322 --> 03:44.324
I got my biggest fear
out the way.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.726
I'm just happy
it's fucking over.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.095
Like, at this point, like,

03:48.095 --> 03:51.331
I'm at a better place now
knowing that it's over.

03:51.331 --> 03:54.568
I am a little concerned
with Jorgeous

03:54.568 --> 03:57.337
and her place
in the competition right now.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.040
I don't feel like Jorgeous
is as confident

04:00.040 --> 04:02.976
as she was in the first half
of the competition,

04:02.976 --> 04:06.480
and the competition
is only getting stiffer now.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.549
It's hard to almost say, like,

04:09.549 --> 04:11.751
I'm fine with whatever
the outcome is,

04:11.751 --> 04:13.887
because I feel like I wouldn't
be fine with whatever.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.957
The fact that I'm here
and so close,

04:16.957 --> 04:22.028
it would just be heartbreaking
to leave when you're that close.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.135
I will say, you're so ready

04:28.135 --> 04:30.570
to just always be vulnerable
and just be yourself,

04:30.570 --> 04:32.506
and I want--no matter
what happens today,

04:32.506 --> 04:34.875
I hope that
it doesn't change that.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.276
You're amazing, you know?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.777
I'm sorry, it's hitting me
a lot right now.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.947
Thank you, thank you.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.251
I just wanna say
if this is my last night,

04:44.251 --> 04:45.519
I want to say, like,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.287
you guys have been the best part
of this competition.

04:47.287 --> 04:52.225
We've bonded in a way
that I just don't think

04:52.225 --> 04:55.095
I ever would have imagined,
and so fast.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.365
So I want you guys to know that
regardless of what happens,

04:58.365 --> 04:59.699
I do love you guys.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.169
I know we're gonna be
bonded for life,

05:02.169 --> 05:05.639
so just get ready, because
we're not going anywhere.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.107
-Absolutely not.
-But enough of the tears.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.542
-I love you!
-Okay, I love you.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.876
-Mwah. I love you, babe.
-Let's go.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.611
-Happy things, happy things.
-I'm gonna go sit down.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.281
-Miss Lady Camden.
-Miss Lady Camden!

05:14.281 --> 05:16.850
Renting a spot in the top
of this competition.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.885
-Okay, bitch?
-I will be honest, like,

05:18.885 --> 05:21.388
I've never felt more beautiful
in my entire life.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.389
This is the prettiest you've
looked this entire competition.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.390
Let me tell you,
like, literally,

05:23.390 --> 05:25.091
like, my vision
for this was, like,

05:25.091 --> 05:27.928
when I first went
to go see a ballet--

05:27.928 --> 05:30.197
I don't know if you guys know,
but I do ballet.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.398
[laughs]

05:31.398 --> 05:32.933
I just remember thinking

05:32.933 --> 05:34.968
I wanna look like that one day.

05:34.968 --> 05:38.572
And it just was a cool full
circle childhood moment today,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.440
where I was, like,
this is a risk,

05:40.440 --> 05:42.876
but this feels very much,
like, where my heart is,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.045
and so I was really nervous
for them to rip it apart,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.347
but they didn't,
so I'm really, really glad.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.648
For real.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.717
Honestly, I don't know
how you guys felt in the roast,

05:50.717 --> 05:53.653
but I wasn't present enough
to really know how I was doing.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.189
I was just sort of like, keep
going, keep going, keep going.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.724
So I didn't, like,
take in the good moments

05:57.724 --> 05:59.359
and really think about the bad.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.695
I was just, like, you know,
kind of get through it.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.463
When you are up there
delivering it,

06:03.463 --> 06:05.165
you don't know,

06:05.165 --> 06:06.600
and on those moments

06:06.600 --> 06:09.536
where they're not feeling
a certain joke,

06:09.536 --> 06:11.238
-it's like...
-...oh, shit.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.372
Absolutely.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.241
I'm ready
to get to the end of this ho.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.643
Girl, no,
that shit was, like...

06:16.643 --> 06:19.346
You were going through it,
though.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.647
You were just, like--

06:20.647 --> 06:22.349
I was like, oh, she's
about to kill someone.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.683
Yes! Fuck.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.285
It felt like
the end of the world

06:25.285 --> 06:27.687
was gonna happen when
I was about to go on stage.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.589
But, like, once it was done,

06:29.589 --> 06:31.858
I was like fuck, okay,
I can breathe, you know?

06:31.858 --> 06:32.859
Right. Yeah.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.894
Damn. [laughs]

06:34.894 --> 06:36.796
I tried to make jokes,
and it's just, like, what?

06:36.796 --> 06:39.065
Like, what the hell
is she even saying?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.034
Hi, Michelle.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.302
I just wanna say

06:42.302 --> 06:46.072
you are more looser
than Ross Mathews pre-COVID.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.043
I like to call "Brasco" Bronco

06:50.043 --> 06:52.112
because she reminds me
of a horse.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.147
-Oh.
-[laughs]

06:55.615 --> 06:58.618
Oh, my God, this is gonna be
the death of Jorgeous, bitch.

06:58.618 --> 07:03.323
So cringey. Like, I probably
won't ever watch this episode.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.324
Miss Willow.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.126
-Yes, bitch!
-Yeah, Willow!

07:06.126 --> 07:08.895
Try and mumble through what
you're trying to feel right now.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.630
[mumbles]
Let me try to talk right now.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.332
[all laugh]

07:12.332 --> 07:14.701
I feel so good.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.903
I just feel so good.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.038
Just shut up.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.572
-[mumbles] So good.
-No, I feel really good.

07:19.572 --> 07:23.643
My set was, like,
strong at the beginning,

07:23.643 --> 07:24.978
and then it dwindled
a little bit.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.780
-But I was just so happy.
-[laughs]

07:26.780 --> 07:28.181
Shut up, you fucking whore.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.784
[all laugh]

07:30.784 --> 07:33.153
I felt really just proud.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.888
Like, I've always been
that person

07:34.888 --> 07:36.456
that's like, I know
I'm gonna be on Drag Race.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.891
Yeah, absolutely.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.959
But I was always, like, I have
to go through these challenges.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.862
Honestly, it's been
so much easier

07:42.862 --> 07:47.434
to have the rest of you
to go through with it.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.536
It's so much
less scary suddenly

07:49.536 --> 07:51.905
when we have each other
to do it.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.006
-Right.
-Yes.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.976
[gasps]
Whose family is that?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.812
-Hi, Willow.
-Hi, Willow.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.447
-We miss you.
-[gasps]

08:00.447 --> 08:02.449
-Aah!
-Oh, Willow!

08:02.449 --> 08:04.918
Oh, my God, I'm almost,
like, convulsing,

08:04.918 --> 08:07.721
because it is just
such a shock to the system.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.256
It just took my breath away
for a second.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.092
We gathered together
this morning

08:12.092 --> 08:14.060
and we were talking about you

08:14.060 --> 08:16.596
and remembering when
you were three years old

08:16.596 --> 08:19.766
and you used to lip sync
to Selena.

08:19.766 --> 08:23.069
And you'd entertain us
for long periods of time,

08:23.069 --> 08:24.971
as well as the neighbors.

08:24.971 --> 08:29.008
And, well, honestly, since your
very first drag performance,

08:29.008 --> 08:33.613
your drag has brought
so much joy into my life

08:33.613 --> 08:35.148
and to all of our lives.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.584
I'm incredibly proud of you.

08:37.584 --> 08:40.787
I'm sure you're exhausted
at this point.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.789
But we want to push you
to keep going

08:42.789 --> 08:46.359
and keep doing
what you love to do.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.627
It's unbelievable
to think you've reached

08:47.627 --> 08:49.229
the biggest dream
you've ever had in your life.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.263
Mm-hmm.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.798
And it is causing us
great anxiety

08:51.798 --> 08:54.167
to think about
where you are in the show.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.335
Yes. Bring home the crown,
Willow.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.570
Bring home the crown.
We love you so much.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.272
-Bye!
-Aw!

08:59.272 --> 09:01.541
-How sweet.
-Oh, my God.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.677
-Oh, my God.
-You... That is so cute.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.546
Oh, my God.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.618
[sobs]

09:13.586 --> 09:15.722
How you feeling, babe?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.893
Why am I wearing this makeup?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.962
[all laugh]

09:22.962 --> 09:24.831
Damn, my face
isn't even moving.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.266
I know, I know.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.434
Oh, my God.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.436
That was just, like, really...

09:31.504 --> 09:34.808
A lot to go through at once.

09:34.808 --> 09:38.812
All my family is just,
like, my whole world.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.014
They've just been through
everything with me

09:41.014 --> 09:45.518
and taken care of me
and my body when I can't.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.223
And just to have those people

09:50.223 --> 09:53.560
that just know, like,
the darkest things about you

09:53.560 --> 09:54.961
and what you've been through,

09:54.961 --> 10:00.300
and the darkest, like, holes
that you've buried yourself in.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.871
These are the people
that I buried my dad with.

10:04.871 --> 10:09.409
It's, like, you can't put
into words what that means,

10:09.409 --> 10:12.345
and I miss them so much.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.548
I never noticed how much
Willow's family means to her.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.884
The people that took care of her

10:17.884 --> 10:19.419
when she couldn't
take care of herself...

10:19.419 --> 10:22.355
That is so inspiring,
because I don't have that.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.523
So it touches me.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.024
It makes me happy for her,

10:25.024 --> 10:27.594
because I know how much
she needed that.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.896
Whew.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.169
Are you laughing or crying?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.303
Both.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.805
You know that bitch
is laughing.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.106
[all laugh]

10:40.106 --> 10:41.741
That bitch is laughing.

10:41.741 --> 10:42.942
It's just so funny.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.711
[all laugh]

10:44.711 --> 10:48.982
It's just fitting for my drag,
just the absurdity of it all,

10:48.982 --> 10:51.684
that I'm, like, sobbing
about this family

10:51.684 --> 10:53.253
that's carried me
through everything,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.021
but I can't move my face.

10:55.021 --> 10:59.259
It's like that Kim Kardashian
meme where she's like, oh!

10:59.259 --> 11:02.128
Oh, I needed that so much.
I'm so happy.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.430
Hello, hello, hello!

11:04.430 --> 11:05.698
[screaming]

11:05.698 --> 11:07.333
I cannot believe
I am in here, girl!

11:07.333 --> 11:09.335
-Yeah!
-Come on!

11:09.335 --> 11:10.603
They found the smallest chair.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.005
So what are we gonna put
my other asscheek on?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.106
[all laugh]

11:13.106 --> 11:14.140
I'm just trying not to fall.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.309
This dress is not paid for.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.912
Listen, y'all
do not understand.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.847
Like, it's been my dream
for me to be on this show.

11:20.847 --> 11:21.848
Yes.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.183
I have been watching
since Season 1,

11:24.183 --> 11:27.253
and I've watched all
of Thailand and UK.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.788
I gotta watch Down Under
and Spain

11:28.788 --> 11:33.226
and Lithuania
or wherever else we're going.

11:33.226 --> 11:37.096
Drag Race Rwanda. I don't know
what the next place is.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.332
So how are y'all feeling?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.800
I'm so-so.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.402
I understand.
I hear you.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.772
Think about how many people
auditioned for this.

11:45.772 --> 11:46.906
Right.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.241
Think about all the work
you put into yourselves

11:48.241 --> 11:49.509
and all the things that you did.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.978
You are blessed to be here,
so be proud of yourself.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.081
To be a drag queen,
you're already changing up

11:55.081 --> 11:57.083
what the reality
of the world is.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.718
-Yeah.
-You understand that?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.720
I'm sorry, queens.
I gotta take Dulcé with me.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.888
-No!
-I love you!

12:01.888 --> 12:04.290
I'll go with you, Justin.
Don't worry.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.625
[all laugh]

12:05.625 --> 12:07.594
No, Justin's ours.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.062
I'll fight you all!
[all laugh]

12:09.062 --> 12:11.064
-Oh, I love her.
-I love you, too!

12:11.064 --> 12:14.567
Bitch, almost every guest
has came back here.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.235
Like, that is sickening.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.570
Mm-hmm.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.873
I really feel like I don't
have my friend right now.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.976
Like I'm not here?
I don't look like myself.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.811
Yeah, because it's, like,
I'm looking for,

12:24.811 --> 12:26.446
like, my sweet Willow face,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.247
and every time I look at you

12:28.247 --> 12:29.983
you're looking at me
like you hate me.

12:29.983 --> 12:30.984
All right, queens.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.652
Five minutes
till the main stage.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.854
Five minutes.
Five minute warning.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.930
When I came into
this competition,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.098
I was, like,
if I have to lip sync,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.265
I don't care who it is.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.403
But when you love someone

12:50.403 --> 12:52.405
and you're connected
with someone,

12:52.405 --> 12:56.843
having to lip sync against them,
it's the worst feeling.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.612
Because I truly love Jorgeous.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.948
But this is a competition,

13:01.948 --> 13:06.252
so my headspace is just
I have to do what I have to do.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.955
Eye on the prize, bitch.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.791
This will be my fifth time
lip syncing

13:11.791 --> 13:14.027
and being in the bottom.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.830
DeJa has been doing so well,

13:17.830 --> 13:22.502
and for me, I've been fucking up
week after week after week.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.304
So, girl, I have to turn it out.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.573
It's really important
for me to kill it,

13:27.573 --> 13:29.709
because this is my gig,
this is what I do.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.511
I cannot fail at this.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.181
All right, queens,
time to go.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.983
Time to head
to the main stage.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.418
All right.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.019
No!

13:40.019 --> 13:41.954
Yes.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.189
Do the thing.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.425
-Wow.
-Wow.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.093
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.961
I've made some decisions.

13:48.961 --> 13:53.866
In a moment, I'll ask two of you
to sashay away.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.436
Daya Betty.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.438
Jorgeous.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.673
DeJa Skye.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.408
The time has come

14:02.408 --> 14:05.111
for you to lip sync

14:05.111 --> 14:08.381
for your life!

14:08.381 --> 14:13.686
Jorgeous, DeJa Skye,
sashay away.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.560
When Ru had told us
to sashay away,

14:20.560 --> 14:23.863
it just felt like a huge relief.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.233
But of course I'm sad
to leave in this competition.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.235
Every week after week after week

14:29.235 --> 14:31.237
I tried to put
my best foot forward,

14:31.237 --> 14:32.872
and, like, it wasn't enough.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.774
But I just feel like

14:34.774 --> 14:36.776
all the pressure
is taken off me now.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.646
Honestly, I'm fucking proud
of myself.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.482
I was capable of things

14:42.482 --> 14:46.753
that I never even thought
I was ever gonna be capable of.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.621
I've surprised myself.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.591
The fact that I got so far,

14:51.591 --> 14:54.360
I cannot be mad about nothin'.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.331
-Oh, my God, this is crazy!
-Sister!

14:58.331 --> 14:59.665
We got eliminated!

14:59.665 --> 15:00.933
Ugh!

15:00.933 --> 15:03.836
Who would have fucking thought
we got eliminated?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.171
I know.
Do you remember walking in?

15:05.171 --> 15:09.876
Bitch, you were sitting
right fucking here.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.677
Just watching you.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.112
And I walked in,

15:13.112 --> 15:14.714
and you said,
"Oh, giving camp!"

15:14.714 --> 15:15.915
Oh, she's campy!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.250
And I was just like,
♪ da da-da da-da ♪

15:17.250 --> 15:19.352
-Bitch, it's okay.
-I love you.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.720
I love you so much more.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.690
But I will say this packing
is gonna be a bitch.

15:24.690 --> 15:28.628
Oh, my God, it was fucking
awful unpacking this shit.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.496
-Get in there!
-Yeah, get the fuck in there.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.764
Get in there!

15:33.499 --> 15:36.068
I don't think that's gonna fit,
but we're gonna make it fit.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.537
Oh, your bitty-bitty-bum-bum.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.707
This is my favorite runway
that I've ever worn here.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.109
Your first runway
was my favorite.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.343
-Really?
-That was everything.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.078
Other than the fact I had
a long-ass cry that day.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.115
I can't help that I have a
wide-set vagina and heavy flow.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.349
Oh, my God.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.285
Honestly, coming into
this competition,

15:52.285 --> 15:55.121
I was nervous that
I was gonna flounder a lot.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.122
I was terrified.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.824
-Really?
-I really was scared.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.759
I didn't wanna make a fool
out of myself, you know,

15:59.759 --> 16:01.260
and, like,
this whole competition

16:01.260 --> 16:02.495
is just making a fucking
fool out of yourself.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.330
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.364
What I'm gonna
take away from this

16:05.364 --> 16:07.066
is, bitch, it's okay
to act stupid.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.068
Like, who the fuck cares,
you know what I mean?

16:09.068 --> 16:12.071
Yes, I will say
there always is a positive.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.708
So rather than harp on
that one negative comment,

16:15.708 --> 16:16.943
harp on all the positives.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.711
-Exactly.
-It's, like, no "regurts."

16:18.711 --> 16:20.413
I sent Orion home.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.148
-Ooh!
-It was then me and Jasmine,

16:22.148 --> 16:25.151
Angie, and Lady Camden.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.920
So one, two, three,
four, five times.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.756
And I only sent
one bitch packing.

16:30.756 --> 16:32.158
Like, what the fuck?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.026
But I'm the only person that
got called a lip sync assassin.

16:34.026 --> 16:34.927
-Bitch, what--
-Just so you know.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.396
What happened this time?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.931
And I'm going home
with the title.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.367
Like, I was the only good one
at Snatch Game.

16:41.367 --> 16:45.972
Oh, my God, isn't it insane
that I sent Daya home,

16:45.972 --> 16:47.573
and now the bitch sent us home?

16:47.573 --> 16:49.242
Bitch, what the fuck?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.476
I'll get you for this!

16:50.476 --> 16:53.980
DeJa Skye, shantay you stay.

16:53.980 --> 16:58.017
Daya Betty, sashay away.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.086
Well, shit.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.021
[all laugh]

17:02.021 --> 17:03.723
I don't know what more of myself

17:03.723 --> 17:05.725
I could have given,
honestly, you know.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.759
I will say this.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.261
You're so fucking young,

17:08.261 --> 17:09.662
I don't think you're sure
of yourself yet.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.197
-Yeah.
-And it comes with age.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.465
But it's crazy to me

17:12.465 --> 17:15.601
that you are so beautiful
inside and out.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.936
With a face like yours,

17:16.936 --> 17:18.838
you could easily
just go straight to cunt.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.106
Thank you so much.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.642
No, honestly, because
you are fucking stunning.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.277
And honestly, before
coming into this competition,

17:24.277 --> 17:25.912
I thought y'all were
gonna be bitches, honestly.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.413
-Really?
-Yes, and I was nervous.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.414
Shady bitch!

17:28.414 --> 17:29.782
Oh, my God!

17:29.782 --> 17:31.317
Oh, bitch!

17:31.317 --> 17:33.085
I have notes.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.021
What does it say, bitch?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.523
"DeJa Skye, you are one person

17:37.523 --> 17:39.525
"who I was beyond thrilled
to see here.

17:39.525 --> 17:42.461
"You deserve this.
Keep breaking boundaries.

17:42.461 --> 17:46.732
And when you sew, make sure
the threads are in the back."

17:46.732 --> 17:47.767
Oh, my God!

17:47.767 --> 17:48.801
That's Camden.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.802
I love her.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.937
Fucking whore!

17:50.937 --> 17:52.338
Let me pick a random one.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.273
Oh, here we go.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.708
Oh, it's from Daya!

17:55.708 --> 17:58.577
"Jorgie, I love you
to the ends of the Earth.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.980
"I hope you know
how proud of you I am.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.983
"I'm so glad that we got
to experience this together.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.852
You're my sister forever,
baby, Daya Betty."

18:06.852 --> 18:09.088
-Aw!
-Aw, Daya!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.356
Such a fake bitch.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.557
Oh, my God!

18:11.557 --> 18:12.558
No, I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.466
-All right, sister.
-Girl, we did it.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.568
Oh...

18:22.568 --> 18:25.705
We walked in here
on our episode the first two,

18:25.705 --> 18:28.874
and we're gonna exit sisters.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.077
-Together. Forever and ever.
-Forever and ever.

18:32.712 --> 18:36.248
Thank you, thank you,
and good night!

18:36.248 --> 18:38.484
Adios! Bye!

18:40.386 --> 18:43.155
This journey has been
fucking everything.

18:43.155 --> 18:47.293
-Ooh.
-Oh!

18:47.293 --> 18:49.729
Oh, I feel great.
I feel accomplished.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.063
Well, I'll be damned.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.064
You need help?

18:52.064 --> 18:53.132
I know those
are bigger than you.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.533
Bitch, y'all are eliminated.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.369
Y'all take y'all's own damn bag.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.038
You ain't gotta leave,

18:59.038 --> 18:59.972
but you gotta get
the fuck up outta here.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.140
Okay, bitch.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.376
Aah!

19:03.376 --> 19:05.444
Ugh!

19:05.444 --> 19:07.813
Girls, you better turn it
the fuck out,

19:07.813 --> 19:11.617
and bitches, remember,
it's gorgeous like Jorgeous.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.519
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

19:13.519 --> 19:15.454
-Bye!
-Bye!

19:15.454 --> 19:16.589
Bye, my babies. Mwah!

19:16.589 --> 19:18.557

19:18.557 --> 19:21.994

19:21.994 --> 19:24.030
