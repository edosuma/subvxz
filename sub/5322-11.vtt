Oh! (Laughs) Gabi, hi!

00:13.052 --> 00:14.953
How are you? How's Switzerland?

00:14.954 --> 00:16.321
Have you learned how to yodel yet?

00:16.344 --> 00:19.848
You ask me that every week and the
answer is still no-de-lay-hee-hoo!

00:19.849 --> 00:22.484
Ha-ha-ha! Gets me every time.

00:23.289 --> 00:26.338
Wait a minute. It not Sunday
night. Why are you calling me now

00:26.339 --> 00:27.565
Oh, I just missed ya.

00:27.566 --> 00:30.751
Aw. Well, how did flambé week go?

00:30.840 --> 00:32.607
Fla-mazing.

00:33.097 --> 00:35.134
I learned how to make a
peppercorn steak with brandy

00:35.135 --> 00:37.554
how to burn down a restaurant...
how to make crÃªpe Suzette...

00:37.555 --> 00:39.287
Ah, wait... wait. Back up.

00:39.288 --> 00:42.139
So, the secret is actually lemon zest...

00:42.140 --> 00:44.326
back it up a little more. Um...

00:44.360 --> 00:46.312
something about burning a restaurant down?

00:46.636 --> 00:50.289
Yeah there may have been
a teeny-tiny major fire.

00:50.929 --> 00:54.736
Ah, the French alcohol that I was using
was a little higher proof than I realized.

00:54.737 --> 00:56.243
You know, I blame the metric system.

00:56.512 --> 00:58.631
(Laughs sarcastically) Did they?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.872
No, they blamed me.

01:01.224 --> 01:04.312
Oh, you poor thing. What are you gonna do?

01:05.882 --> 01:07.108
Come home?

01:07.109 --> 01:09.942
Oh, my God! You're here!

01:10.309 --> 01:11.509
They kicked me out.

01:11.515 --> 01:13.033
Aw, you okay?

01:13.034 --> 01:14.623

01:37.487 --> 01:40.795
Well, overall, it sounds
like you had a great time.

01:42.325 --> 01:45.431
But, ah, don't you think we should
talk about the elephant in the room?

01:45.432 --> 01:47.699
Yes, Sofia, listen, I'm going to get a job

01:47.700 --> 01:49.659
and I'm going to be able
to pay rent. I promise.

01:49.660 --> 01:51.440
No-no, I was walking about Josh.

01:51.828 --> 01:53.366
Oh, that elephant.

01:54.301 --> 01:55.968
So, like, what's your plan?

01:55.981 --> 01:57.403
Well, it's funny you should ask.

01:57.404 --> 01:59.638
I was gonna go to his place
straight from the airport,

01:59.639 --> 02:01.169
I was going to look him
right in the eye and say,

02:01.170 --> 02:05.007
"the way that I left was hurtful
and horrible and I am so, so sorry.

02:05.008 --> 02:06.185
Can you ever forgive me?"

02:06.186 --> 02:08.055
- Well, why didn't you?
- I got scared.

02:09.288 --> 02:11.935
(Sighs) When I was in Switzerland,
I tried reaching out. You know...

02:11.936 --> 02:15.604
I called him and I texted him. But then
I felt like I should just leave him alone

02:15.637 --> 02:17.909
- Why?
- 'Cause he wrote back, "leave me alone."

02:20.778 --> 02:22.908
But now that I'm home,
I really want to see him.

02:22.909 --> 02:26.041
But why? Because you feel guilty?
Because you want to apologize?

02:26.042 --> 02:27.597
Because you still have feelings for him?

02:27.598 --> 02:29.799
Yes, yes, and I don't know.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.594
(Gasps) Oh, my God!

02:32.595 --> 02:35.089
Do you think that I subconsciously
burnt down that restaurant

02:35.090 --> 02:37.048
so that I could come
home early and see him?

02:37.138 --> 02:38.338
No!

02:39.931 --> 02:43.274
And that is what you will
tell the police and everyone.

02:50.027 --> 02:51.761
(In British accent) I still can't believe

02:51.762 --> 02:53.607
you're controlling that with your phone.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.610
Yeah. With my app, you can
control it with any phone.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.818
It's kind of like a universal
TV remote, but for drones.

02:59.861 --> 03:02.179
Wow! Two things that everyone loves.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.629
Drones and people always on their phones.

03:04.778 --> 03:06.147
I want to buy it.

03:06.245 --> 03:07.820
Like I told you before,

03:07.821 --> 03:11.082
the app isn't for sale.

03:11.116 --> 03:13.404
Well, here's something new.

03:13.766 --> 03:16.309
How about I buy your whole company?

03:16.687 --> 03:17.887
Not interested.

03:17.904 --> 03:19.994
- I'll give you half a billion dollars.
- Interested.

03:20.838 --> 03:24.574
Yolanda, if Josh sells his company to Kal,

03:24.575 --> 03:27.968
I will be the publicist to one of
the richest men in San Francisco.

03:28.654 --> 03:32.960
And I'll be washing the underpants of
one of the richest men in San Francisco.

03:35.344 --> 03:36.614
Yours sounds better.

03:38.035 --> 03:42.005
Josh is about to hit it big and
his whole team will share the glory.

03:42.228 --> 03:43.428
Except you.

03:44.464 --> 03:46.005
You're new.

03:46.999 --> 03:49.034
No one cares about you.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.013
Who hurt you?

03:53.204 --> 03:55.095
(Knocking on door)

03:55.512 --> 03:57.712
I'll get it! Is is the best day ever.

04:03.646 --> 04:05.743
- Hi!
- (Screaming)

04:07.553 --> 04:11.438
Oh, my God! It returned!

04:12.725 --> 04:14.693
Go away!

04:14.846 --> 04:16.680
(Gabi continues knocking) Please, Elliot.

04:18.295 --> 04:19.853
I just need to talk to Josh.

04:19.853 --> 04:22.203
No! You will never set
foot in this house again...

04:22.204 --> 04:24.536
Oh, my damn, Gabi! Come on in!

04:24.537 --> 04:27.239
No, Yolanda! I forbid it.

04:27.273 --> 04:28.874
- Forbid this.
- Oh!

04:29.342 --> 04:32.237
- Gabi?
- Hey, Josh.

04:33.346 --> 04:36.882
Is it me or did it just
get awkward in here?

04:37.123 --> 04:38.917
Ah, you're back early.

04:39.336 --> 04:43.503
Yeah, um... about that. Listen, I kinda
want to talk to you about something.

04:43.504 --> 04:46.381
Elliot, maybe we shouldn't
stand here and watch this.

04:46.382 --> 04:49.006
You're right. Let's stand over there.

04:50.692 --> 04:54.217
If this is about your... your job, you
know I-I actually, I hired a new chef.

04:54.218 --> 04:55.593
Yeah. Oh, I know. Yolanda told me.

04:56.335 --> 04:57.954
Oh! Here she is. Adriana.

04:58.269 --> 05:01.607
This is Gabi, my ex... chef... ex-chef.

05:01.608 --> 05:03.760
Oh, you're Gabi.

05:03.816 --> 05:07.447
Or as Elliot calls you,
"she who must not be named."

05:08.361 --> 05:10.681
- Pleased to meet you, yeah.
- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

05:11.154 --> 05:14.649
- So, is now a good time to talk...
- Never! He doesn't want to talk to you!

05:15.802 --> 05:17.769
Is that true, Josh? Do
you not want to talk to me?

05:17.770 --> 05:21.011
Of course he wants to talk to you! He's
got a lot of feelings he needs to let out!

05:21.026 --> 05:24.131
Because I have feelings that I need to
let out, too. Starting with I'm sorry.

05:24.132 --> 05:27.974
You can save your apology! He has moved on!

05:28.008 --> 05:31.681
- The hell he has! Oh, oh...
- Yolanda, stay out of it!

05:31.682 --> 05:32.882
Stop!

05:33.260 --> 05:36.164
You! You! Out!

05:36.817 --> 05:39.852
(Exclaims dismissively)
Someone's wound a little tight!

05:41.588 --> 05:44.035
Look, um... Elliot's right.

05:44.036 --> 05:48.327
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm, moved on. Everything's cool.

05:48.362 --> 05:51.240
In case you were wondering, a
seagull ate your dessert, not me.

05:51.498 --> 05:52.958
I better be off.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.201
Ah Kal, this is my former chef Gabi.

05:55.202 --> 05:58.244
She just got back from a really
fancy apprenticeship in Switzerland.

05:58.618 --> 06:01.794
Ooh! An apprenticeship in
Europe. You must be good.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.837
Oh, I'm looking for a
chef. Are you interested?

06:04.838 --> 06:06.038
Both: Excuse me?

06:06.039 --> 06:08.981
Oh! I'm sorry. We haven't
been properly introduced.

06:08.991 --> 06:10.557
I just moved in next door.

06:10.558 --> 06:14.134
- I'm Kal. I'm a billionaire.
- Oh. Oh!

06:14.208 --> 06:15.708
Next door? Um...

06:15.709 --> 06:18.095
Listen, Josh, the last thing I
want to do is make you feel awkward.

06:18.096 --> 06:20.690
What? Me? No. You! Awkward! Me? What?

06:22.241 --> 06:25.640
Look, we... we had a little
thing before she left.

06:25.641 --> 06:27.842
A-actually, we-we didn't. We-we almost did.

06:27.947 --> 06:30.872
Well, I really didn't want to
get into the middle of a thing.

06:30.899 --> 06:33.239
No, there... there was no
thing. Did you not just hear me?

06:33.240 --> 06:34.607
No thing happened.

06:34.608 --> 06:37.916
And since there was no thing, there's
nothing to get in the middle of.

06:37.917 --> 06:40.372
Just a bunch of... (Mimics whooshing) Air.

06:42.382 --> 06:45.194
So, you're cool if I take the job?

06:45.195 --> 06:48.141
Cool! Me! What? Yes!
Cool! Me! Yeah! Job take.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.003
- You're sure?
- I mean,

06:52.004 --> 06:53.310
is no one hearing what I'm saying?

06:53.311 --> 06:55.950
(Mimics tapping on microphone)
Is this thing on? Take the job.

06:57.731 --> 07:01.634
Um... okay. I guess
I'll take it. Thank you.

07:01.668 --> 07:03.223
Great! Can you start right away?

07:03.224 --> 07:05.082
I've got a very important
business dinner tomorrow night,

07:05.083 --> 07:06.539
and I really have to impress the guy.

07:06.573 --> 07:07.945
Oh, who's the guy?

07:08.116 --> 07:09.385
Me.

07:17.054 --> 07:19.055
I still can't believe it.

07:19.089 --> 07:20.790
Only you would get a job

07:20.824 --> 07:23.826
that just so happens to be
across the hall from the elephant.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.593
(Sighs) I know! But I asked
the elephant a hundred times

07:26.594 --> 07:29.452
and he said he was cool with it. So
what am I supposed to do? I need a job.

07:29.453 --> 07:32.053
Well, on that note, take a seat.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.588
Sofia, I don't need one of your
pep talks that's actually a lecture.

07:37.823 --> 07:39.524
Oh! But you do.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.827
This new job is a fresh start.

07:42.828 --> 07:46.824
So, to help you stay on track, I've put
together a little list of dos and don'ts.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.920
(Clearing throat) "Do act professional.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.928
"Don't have sex with your boss.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.890
"Do wear pants.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.143
Don't take them off."

07:58.144 --> 08:01.880
- Sofia, I'm not gonna sleep with K...
- Hey! Hey!

08:01.914 --> 08:04.449
"Do prepare a delicious dinner
tonight for Kal and Josh.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.682
"Don't engage with Josh. Don't look at him.

08:06.683 --> 08:08.707
Don't talk about the past.
Don't talk about the future."

08:08.708 --> 08:10.117
- But what if... but what if he...
- Don't. Don't.

08:10.118 --> 08:11.022
- But what if he..
- Don't

08:11.057 --> 08:12.257
(Groans)

08:12.592 --> 08:14.693
Okay, fine. You're right, Sofia.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.039
Man, how did I ever make it
in Switzerland without you?

08:17.863 --> 08:19.164
You didn't.

08:20.509 --> 08:22.393
You burned down a restaurant.

Oh, my God. Gabi, this looks amazing.

08:36.131 --> 08:37.681
Well, your place is amazing.

08:37.682 --> 08:39.025
I especially love the piano.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.672
- Is it a grand? Oh.
- Oh, it cost way more than that.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.809
Listen, Kal, I just want you know

08:43.811 --> 08:46.737
that tonight's dinner with Josh is
going to be completely professional.

08:46.738 --> 08:49.127
- Why wouldn't it be?
- It would be.

08:49.537 --> 08:51.297
- (Knock on door)
- Ah, that's Josh.

08:51.305 --> 08:52.644
Um, I'm going to go in the other room.

08:52.645 --> 08:55.084
Could you announce me how they
do on <i>Downton Abbey?</i>

08:55.146 --> 08:56.346
Yes.

08:57.188 --> 09:00.738
Okay. Be professional. Don't talk about
the past. Don't talk about the future.

09:01.394 --> 09:02.718
We need to talk.

09:03.809 --> 09:06.353
Gabi, this is a really important night.

09:06.605 --> 09:08.860
I know! For me, too!

09:08.868 --> 09:10.742
We finally have a chance to talk.

09:10.743 --> 09:13.486
I'm talking about the deal with
Kal. This is really important to me.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.687
But I know that you're feeling things.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.774
Like annoyed?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.829
Good. That's good. Go on.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.429
Look, I meant what I said yesterday.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.358
I'm cool with you working here, so
can you please just act professional?

09:28.300 --> 09:31.634
Fine! Can I get you a glass of wine, sir?

09:31.635 --> 09:35.543
No, thank you. $500 million
deals and alcohol do not mix well.

09:35.591 --> 09:39.452
I was waiting to be announced, but how
long can a man hide behind his own door?

09:39.453 --> 09:41.445
Sorry. Um. (British accent) May I please

09:41.446 --> 09:42.814
- introduce...
- The moment passed.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.321
- Hello, Josh.
- Good to see you, Kal.

09:45.270 --> 09:50.528
Before we get started, there's something,
er, personal I wanted to discuss with you.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.657
Sure, what is it?

09:52.692 --> 09:54.759
(Sighs) All right. I'll
get right down to it.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.804
I'm hot for your chef.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.024
I hope it's not a problem.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.636
(Scoffing) Problem?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.073
Hell no, it's great!

10:06.372 --> 10:08.473
She's fantastic.

10:08.507 --> 10:09.800
I know we only just met,

10:09.801 --> 10:11.931
but we've got the most amazing connection.

10:11.932 --> 10:14.279
(Laughing nervously) I
love it! It's fun. Fun news.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.762
Great! I'm going to ask her out as
soon as we're finished with dinner.

10:17.797 --> 10:19.698
Okay, the first course is ready.

10:19.699 --> 10:22.187
(gasps) This looks divine.

10:22.221 --> 10:25.150
Gabi, you're a godsend.

10:25.151 --> 10:27.274
I can't believe you let
me steal her away from you.

10:27.275 --> 10:29.442
(Chuckles uncomfortably)
You know, it's not stealing

10:29.443 --> 10:31.739
when she wasn't even working
for me. Gabi, more wine?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.346
- Oh, I thought you...
- More wine!

10:33.347 --> 10:35.534
(Slurps) Mmm.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.923
Gabi, your oyster is perfection.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.479
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.080
There's plenty more where that came from.

10:43.081 --> 10:45.777
All right! You know what? I
don't need this big fancy dinner.

10:45.942 --> 10:47.767
I've had Gabi's oysters.

10:47.824 --> 10:50.037
Do you have the initial
offer for me to sign?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.535
A man who knows what he wants.

10:51.863 --> 10:55.253
All right. Let's get down to biz-natch.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.222
Now feel free to take
your time and look over

10:57.256 --> 11:00.597
- No. Blah, blah, blah. Lots of zeros.
- everything...

11:00.598 --> 11:03.261
All looks in order. Signing.

11:03.295 --> 11:06.030
Letter of intent off to the attorney's.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.932
Great doing biz-natch with you.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.968
Cheerio! Tut-tut! Must be off!

11:11.921 --> 11:14.264
(In British accent) May I now
introduce the second course...

11:14.265 --> 11:16.780
Ah, you've never seen
<i>Downton Abbey,</i> have you?

11:17.407 --> 11:18.607
No.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.500
(Mimicking Kal) I'm going to
ask her to hang out tonight.

11:26.501 --> 11:27.646
(Male voice) Hey, Kal, guess what?

11:27.647 --> 11:28.929
(Mimicking Kal) I don't care!

11:34.155 --> 11:35.385
(Sighs)

11:53.179 --> 11:54.379
(Grunts)

12:21.979 --> 12:24.816
(Scoffing) Champagne! Like
that's going to impress her.

12:25.748 --> 12:27.629
Holy cow, I think it did!

12:28.398 --> 12:30.433
Is it too soon to go to the bedroom?

12:30.467 --> 12:32.691
(Laughing) No!

12:33.203 --> 12:35.037
Wait! Adriana?

12:37.658 --> 12:41.020
Oh, no! No, no, no! No, no!

12:41.458 --> 12:43.079
(Drone clattering)

12:43.080 --> 12:46.949
Ohh, drone down! We have a drone down!

12:55.599 --> 12:57.053
Thank you!

12:58.467 --> 12:59.813
Good first day?

12:59.814 --> 13:03.206
You'll be happy to
know, I kept my pants on.

13:03.505 --> 13:06.319
- Here's to baby steps.
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.074
Kal was great. I had no problem with Kal.

13:09.075 --> 13:11.454
But when Josh showed up for his
business dinner he wouldn't talk to me.

13:11.455 --> 13:13.948
I tried to get him to talk to me, but he
just wouldn't. And then he was all like,

13:13.949 --> 13:16.363
(Mocking) "Tut-tut.
Cheerio. I must be off".

13:17.976 --> 13:19.522
Why are you looking at me like that?

13:19.523 --> 13:22.735
It's just... all your
stupid, crazy, drama...

13:23.316 --> 13:25.048
- I missed you!
- Aw!

13:25.961 --> 13:27.829
Come on. I'm not all stupid, crazy drama.

13:27.863 --> 13:30.717
(Pounding on door) Gabi, open
the door quick! Gabi! Gabi! Gabi!

13:32.688 --> 13:35.025
I flew a drone into Kal's
penthouse and I crashed it

13:35.026 --> 13:36.593
and I need you to get it back for me.

13:36.769 --> 13:40.771
Oh! I can't believe I thought
learning to knit could fill this void.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.429
Okay, what are you talking about?

13:43.430 --> 13:46.503
Look, Gabi, I need you to get that drone
back for me. I could lose $500 million.

13:46.504 --> 13:49.388
- Okay, I'll help you. If...
- Great. Let's go. (Groans)

13:50.559 --> 13:54.189
If you agree to have a talk when we're
done. A real talk. A feelings talk.

13:54.753 --> 13:57.281
- Do you have the key to Kal's apartment?
- Yes.

13:57.282 --> 13:58.482
Feelings talk it is. Let's go.

14:08.879 --> 14:10.922
(Whispering) I think the
drone is over by the piano.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.287
Okay. Wait here.

14:17.350 --> 14:18.550
Ooh!

14:23.619 --> 14:26.287
Josh, I got it.

14:27.556 --> 14:28.769
That's a Roomba.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.489
A vacuum.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.942
Now would be a good time to tell you,
I don't know what a drone looks like.

14:38.751 --> 14:40.251
It's a quad copter with four rotors.

14:40.252 --> 14:42.508
(Scoffing) Four rotors!

14:42.509 --> 14:44.136
Why didn't you say so?

14:50.145 --> 14:52.438
What the hell? Kal!

14:52.856 --> 14:55.024
What... what am I doing in here?

14:55.884 --> 14:59.015
Is the question you're probably asking.

14:59.016 --> 15:01.251
Gabi, I know you're
looking for Josh's drone.

15:01.252 --> 15:03.214
Oh, that's a drone!

15:03.590 --> 15:05.524
Yep, you caught me.
That's what I'm here for.

15:05.525 --> 15:06.890
But not because he put me up to it.

15:06.891 --> 15:09.430
I'm here completely on my own... with Josh.

15:09.818 --> 15:11.959
Josh, what the hell is
this doing in my apartment?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.699
Kal, I can explain everything.

15:14.996 --> 15:17.338
The drone's artificial
intelligence is too advanced.

15:17.339 --> 15:19.340
This could be the start
of a robot uprising.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.066
Cut the crap. Why are you spying on me?

15:22.311 --> 15:23.549
Kal, I'm not spying on you.

15:23.550 --> 15:25.290
What's going on out here? Oh.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.579
Oh, Adriana? I think the question is
what's going on in there, sexy robe?

15:29.840 --> 15:31.534
Oh, I get it.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.734
I knew you were bothered when I
asked if I could date your chef.

15:34.764 --> 15:36.388
You were spying on Adriana.

15:36.389 --> 15:39.961
Wait, Kal, you asked Josh
if you could date his chef?

15:39.962 --> 15:42.362
Do you think he meant
me chef and not she chef?

15:42.549 --> 15:43.865
What?

15:43.899 --> 15:47.372
I know what's going on here.
Listen, he wasn't spying on you.

15:47.970 --> 15:49.444
He was spying on me.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.860
I don't care who he was spying on.

15:51.874 --> 15:53.675
The point is he was spying!

15:53.709 --> 15:55.743
I need to trust the
people that I work with.

15:55.778 --> 15:58.825
The deal is off. And you, you're fired.

15:58.826 --> 16:00.067
Both: What?

16:00.068 --> 16:01.824
But what about my perfect oyster?

16:03.652 --> 16:05.253
But who's gonna cook for you?

16:06.258 --> 16:07.965
Actually, I'm going to.

16:08.161 --> 16:10.201
Ah, Josh, I'm sorry, I quit.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.193
I'm going to go work for Kal now.

16:12.194 --> 16:15.163
Wait a minute. You are going to cook
for the same guy you're sleeping with?

16:15.164 --> 16:18.132
(Scoffs) Girl, I have a
dos and don'ts list for you.

16:21.270 --> 16:23.171
Well, thanks a lot, you just got me fired!

16:23.205 --> 16:25.576
Yeah, well, you just cost
me a $500 million deal!

16:25.577 --> 16:27.041
Me? Me? That was you.

16:27.076 --> 16:28.890
- That was all you!
- Oh, whatever!

16:30.813 --> 16:33.081
Okay. Deal's a deal. Time to talk.

16:33.115 --> 16:34.847
Okay. I'm upset.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.394
I think my drone's broken.
And now you know how I feel.

16:40.188 --> 16:41.824
What the hell is the matter with you?

16:41.825 --> 16:44.548
I mean, when I first got
back, you said you'd moved on,

16:44.549 --> 16:46.826
and you were good. And now, all
of a sudden you're spying on me

16:46.827 --> 16:48.440
because you think I'm
sleeping with your neighbor?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.682
I mean, what is that all about?

16:49.683 --> 16:51.051
Do you really want to
know what that's all about

16:51.052 --> 16:53.268
or are you just gonna jump on another
plane when things get too difficult?

16:53.269 --> 16:55.849
Oh! So you <i>are</i> mad.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.472
You pulled the rug out from under me, Gabi!

17:00.334 --> 17:03.340
You left me like a smiling idiot
at Elliot's engagement party!

17:05.214 --> 17:09.083
I told you I loved you, I kissed you,
and I know that meant something to you.

17:09.765 --> 17:12.164
- It did.
- Then who would you leave me like that?

17:12.459 --> 17:14.608
(Sighs) Because...

17:14.609 --> 17:17.115
Josh, if I saw you then I
wouldn't have been able to go.

17:18.719 --> 17:20.795
When I first left, I kept
asking myself, you know,

17:20.796 --> 17:22.988
how I could leave when we
were just getting started.

17:23.147 --> 17:24.817
And what did you come up with?

17:25.099 --> 17:26.819
Because I couldn't come up with anything.

17:28.796 --> 17:30.738
Being with you would have been too easy.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.392
This is easy?

17:35.844 --> 17:37.806
(Sighs) Josh.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.548
You would move mountains to make me happy.

17:41.635 --> 17:43.365
And I want to move my own mountains.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.737
- Does that make any sense?
- I know what mountains are.

17:48.322 --> 17:51.641
You know, I went to Switzerland because
I want to be the next Julia Child.

17:51.642 --> 17:53.294
And if you did everything for me,

17:53.328 --> 17:56.097
then I would lose my own drive
to make that dream come true.

17:56.131 --> 17:58.923
- Do you understand that?
- I know what dreams are.

18:00.169 --> 18:01.369
Josh...

18:01.676 --> 18:03.377
Look, Gabi...

18:04.827 --> 18:06.756
when you left, it was horrible.

18:07.533 --> 18:08.841
I was a mess.

18:09.978 --> 18:11.946
So I threw myself into work...

18:13.882 --> 18:18.274
and... actually it kinda got me to a
place where I almost made $500 million.

18:20.326 --> 18:23.653
So, me leaving was a good thing?

18:24.620 --> 18:27.375
Yeah. My accountant thinks you
should ruin my life more often.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.789
But, Gabi...

18:34.603 --> 18:36.436
I can't go through that again.

18:36.494 --> 18:41.709
Josh, I'm... I'm sorry. I am
really, truly, very, very sorry.

18:43.512 --> 18:46.347
And you for...

18:46.348 --> 18:47.793
- give... Aw,
- I forgive you, Gabi.

18:47.799 --> 18:50.462
Josh, you did not have to say that.

18:52.612 --> 18:54.276
So, where do we go from here?

18:56.158 --> 18:58.296
How about we go back to
doing what we do best?

18:59.448 --> 19:03.418
- Being friends.
- (Sighs) I would love that.

19:03.773 --> 19:04.973
Me, too.

19:07.069 --> 19:09.191
- So, we're good?
- We're very good.

19:10.038 --> 19:13.641
Good. Feelings talk adjourned.

19:15.419 --> 19:17.387
All right. I got to get out of here.

19:17.388 --> 19:19.302
I gotta get up early
and start the job search.

19:20.543 --> 19:22.550
(Sighs) Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:24.237 --> 19:26.464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.105
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What?

19:30.826 --> 19:32.460
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

19:33.220 --> 19:34.475
What?

19:37.319 --> 19:38.912
- Do you want...
- Yes!

19:40.308 --> 19:41.508
- ...your old job back?
- Yes!

19:41.509 --> 19:44.355
Yes, I do, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

19:44.740 --> 19:46.374
Now I don't have to get up early.

19:49.501 --> 19:50.701
Hey!

19:52.929 --> 19:54.415
Thanks for the feelings talk.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.284
Well, what are friends for?

19:57.242 --> 20:00.286
- See you tomorrow, chef.
- See you tomorrow, boss.

20:03.908 --> 20:05.108
(Sighs)

20:10.147 --> 20:13.961
Elliot, I have some news.

20:15.811 --> 20:17.444
The deal with Kal's off.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.966
Dammit! All that money!

20:22.892 --> 20:24.236
Okay, well...

20:24.237 --> 20:27.564
I'll just be the publicist to one
of the cutest guys in San Francisco.

20:29.616 --> 20:31.052
I have some other news...

20:32.554 --> 20:33.943
Adriana quit.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.550
Good morning!

20:36.551 --> 20:38.326
No!

20:38.601 --> 20:39.950
It lives!

20:40.057 --> 20:41.257
No!
