00:15.015 --> 00:16.058
[music playing]

00:45.045 --> 00:47.631
-[class bell ringing]
-[Coach Lawrence] The teeth tear and chew,

00:47.714 --> 00:51.260
grinding the food into paste
before it's swallowed.

00:51.343 --> 00:55.764
Then, it travels down the wind pipe...
I mean, esophagus.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.433
So the reason you were late
and covered in dirt

00:58.517 --> 01:00.435
was because you were fighting
a "mud monster"?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.564
While there was some gnarly troll
watching you? Talk about creepy.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.441
I know. It was like he was studying me.

01:06.525 --> 01:12.739
To the guts, where the juices
break it down into a bubbling nasty soup.

01:12.823 --> 01:13.824
What are you gonna do?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.742
I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.913
So after it weaves through this mess,
it comes out the old...

01:19.997 --> 01:21.039
[stammers, coughs]

01:21.123 --> 01:23.166
you know-- "the back door."

01:23.250 --> 01:24.835
Coach? Yeah, thank you.

01:24.918 --> 01:29.673
Don't mean to "butt" in,
but I'd like to "gas" a question?

01:29.756 --> 01:32.634
-Hey, poo's laughing?
-Watch it, Palchuk!

01:32.718 --> 01:33.719
This is serious!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.263
Hey, why don't you shut your hole, Steve?

01:36.346 --> 01:42.311
Oh, that's it. That's it, jokers!
Both of you, principal's office, now!

01:42.394 --> 01:44.396
[Steve] You think you can
out-poo-pun me, Lake?

01:44.479 --> 01:47.024
How could I do that
when you are the biggest piece--

01:47.107 --> 01:49.568
Young Atlas,
getting into trouble again, I see.

01:50.569 --> 01:55.115
Ahem, Principal Strickler,
this has been a huge misunderstanding.

01:55.198 --> 01:59.036
You have a lot of nerve showing
your face around here, Strickler.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.081
I've decided I'm not done with you.
Your education has just begun.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.334
Oh, good. Maybe I'm a slow learner.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.711
Because I can't figure out
why you'd come back

02:07.794 --> 02:11.632
after I dropped a bomb
all over your big parade.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.052
For the record, I just want to say
he's not speaking on my behalf.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.303
-Shut up, Steve!
-Shut up, Steve!

02:16.386 --> 02:19.890
I'm in a position
to make your life truly miserable.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.017
I could take you out right now.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.312
[Strickler] And I could do far worse.
Are you ready for that?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.735
I'm sorry about the poop jokes!
They really weren't that funny!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.236
Detention. For both of you.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.782
Now get out of my office
before I change my mind.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.201
[Steve whimpers]

02:44.289 --> 02:45.874
[spurts]

02:45.957 --> 02:47.626
[car horns beeping]

02:48.460 --> 02:50.670
I should have pulled Daylight on him
right then and there.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.173
-Steve would've gone bananas.
-It's probably good you waited.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.468
I imagine murdering your principal looks
pretty bad on your college application.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.553
I'll just have to wait and get him alone.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.389
-[stone rings]
-[gasps]

03:00.472 --> 03:01.390
What's wrong?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.268
[crow caws]

03:09.898 --> 03:12.234
I just got a weird feeling.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.862
I have those all the time,
it's usually after the school lunch.

03:15.946 --> 03:16.947
[scratches]

03:22.077 --> 03:23.286
[clinks]

03:23.370 --> 03:24.830
[jingles]

03:29.209 --> 03:30.710
[jingles]

03:33.380 --> 03:34.714
[cracks]

03:37.050 --> 03:39.803
Come on. Blinky said he had something
urgent he wanted to tell us.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.388
Hmm.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.766
[chuckles]

03:46.727 --> 03:49.312
I've spent nights
poring over the legend of the stones,

03:49.396 --> 03:50.480
decoding its hidden meanings.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.857
Endless, sleepless nights.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.234
The Triumbric Stones. You found something?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.069
At first, I combed every library
for insights,

03:56.153 --> 03:57.404
but there is nothing written.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.741
<i>Rumors say they are tied</i>
<i>to Gunmar's life force.</i>

04:00.824 --> 04:04.035
<i>So I searched for stones that would have</i>
<i>a significance to his past...</i>

04:04.119 --> 04:05.203
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] <i>Birthstone.</i>

04:05.287 --> 04:09.458
-Indeed. Such as Gunmar's Birthstone.
-Why is it so powerful?

04:09.541 --> 04:13.170
Long ago, trolls lived underground,
blissfully unaware of humankind above.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.755
Inevitably, our worlds collided.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.882
Trolls and humans each wanted the world
as their own and fought for it.

04:17.966 --> 04:23.180
Blood was shed, and our First Heartstone
rotted from within.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.184
And from it, Gunmar was born.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.395
Birthstone, okay.
Where would we find that?

04:30.479 --> 04:31.980
<i>Birthstone gone.</i>

04:32.063 --> 04:34.316
It was plundered
before any good could come from it.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
But then I remembered this passage.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.236
"Three forces Elemental thou must seek

04:38.320 --> 04:41.364
in marshland, caverns deep,
and mountain's peak."

04:41.448 --> 04:42.532
Ah.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.367
Which is elusive, but the clue...

04:44.451 --> 04:47.996
Is hidden in the final stanza--
"mountain's peak." It's so obvious!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.372
The stone is hidden in a mountain.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.044
-Sorry. I'm a riddle dork.
-Yeah, I'm not getting it.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.670
Gatto's Keep!

04:55.754 --> 04:57.422
Deep in the realm of the Volcanic Trolls

04:57.506 --> 04:59.758
is a vault
of the greatest treasures untold.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.511
Treasures too powerful
for the underworld to possess.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.013
<i>Treasures kept locked up</i>
<i>by Gatto himself.</i>

05:05.096 --> 05:06.765
-Treasures like...
-[Jim] The Birthstone.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.226
So this Gatto has the stone
that will help us get Enrique back?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.020
-If I could just finish a thought...
-When do we leave?

05:12.103 --> 05:15.607
Wait, this sounds like a quest.
This is a quest!

05:15.690 --> 05:19.110
Guys, we're going on our first official
Trollhunters quest!

05:19.194 --> 05:20.237
[Blinky] Pack your bags.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.572
There's more to see in this world
than you know.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.700
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!
Trollhunter quest!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.119
[clatters]

05:28.203 --> 05:29.412
[knocks]

05:29.496 --> 05:30.330
Going somewhere?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.999
Um... uh, yes, yeah!

05:33.083 --> 05:37.629
A camping trip
with Tobes, Claire, and a few others.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.423
And when were you gonna ask <i>me?</i>
What if I said no?

05:40.507 --> 05:45.136
Sorry, it just kind of sprung up.
I was gonna leave a note, but...

05:45.220 --> 05:48.265
-Well, you can't go.
-I have to.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.391
Then you're grounded.

05:49.474 --> 05:53.019
Okay, well,
you can ground me when I get back.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.437
[scoffs]

05:57.524 --> 05:58.525
[speaking softly] Jim...

06:00.860 --> 06:02.279
[sighs]

06:02.362 --> 06:03.863
I'm sorry, Mom.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.198
Whoa.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.908
You've never taken us this far before.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.703
[Blinky] Because out here, Tobias,
there is no protection.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.081
Beyond the barriers of Trollmarket
lie unforgiving realms,

06:13.164 --> 06:14.833
ripe with lawlessness.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.544
Aha! We're here.
Did everyone come prepared?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.171
Yeah, I've got my flashlight,
horngazel, amulet...

06:20.255 --> 06:25.635
-I've got a first-aid kit, matches...
-And I got tacos! Extra spicy!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.178
What? I get hungry on a quest.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.888
-[munches]
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! groans]

06:28.972 --> 06:31.266
-What's wrong, wingman?
-Hate gyre.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.644
-What's a "gyre"?
-Come with me and prepare to be amazed.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.356
-[Jim] Seriously? You brought tacos?
-[Toby] I brought enough for everyone!

06:40.775 --> 06:42.277
[rumbles]

06:48.491 --> 06:50.327
[whirs]

06:53.830 --> 06:55.332
[kids gasp]

06:59.169 --> 07:00.295
[thumps]

07:00.462 --> 07:01.963
[Toby stammers]

07:04.257 --> 07:07.385
That's the coolest troll-y trolley
I've ever seen!

07:07.469 --> 07:09.220
-Gyre.
-Yes. A gyre.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.723
Our kind's quickest form
of transportation.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.558
For the last 200 years,

07:13.642 --> 07:16.102
trolls have used the vast network
of subterranean sewers

07:16.186 --> 07:18.855
to get to any part of the world
in record time!

07:18.939 --> 07:22.275
-Wait, Gatto isn't in Arcadia?
-[chuckles] Of course not.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.610
[whirring]

07:23.693 --> 07:26.863
He lives under
what you humans call Argentina.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.574
[Claire] Argentina!
That's a whole other continent, Blinky!

07:29.658 --> 07:31.242
How long is it going to take to get there?

07:31.326 --> 07:35.080
Less time than you'd think.
Let's burn some tunnel!

07:35.163 --> 07:36.206
-[gyre whines]
-[Toby screams]

07:36.289 --> 07:38.458
-[screaming]
-[laughing]

07:40.919 --> 07:41.962
[screaming continues]

07:42.045 --> 07:43.421
[laughing]

07:46.675 --> 07:48.969
[distorted screaming]

07:53.848 --> 07:54.849
[Blinky] Ha-ha!

07:54.933 --> 07:56.726
A new record! You see? Was that so bad?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.144
[Toby retches]

07:58.228 --> 08:00.563
Yes. Yes, it was.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.732
-Hate gyre.
-[Claire] Gross, Toby.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.777
Out of curiosity,
have either of you ever met this Gatto?

08:05.860 --> 08:08.530
Uh, no, Master Jim.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.907
In fact, I've done everything
in my power to avoid him.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.951
Very few ever return from his keep. So...

08:13.034 --> 08:14.411
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Stay close.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.664
Agh! It's so hot. Why is it so hot?

08:18.707 --> 08:21.334
[Claire] Because
we're in a volcano, aren't we?

08:21.418 --> 08:26.172
Welcome to Ojos del Salado,
the home of Gatto.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.008
"Ojos del Salado"?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.010
Well, that's not gonna be good
for my mobile plan.

08:34.222 --> 08:38.308
Uh, you there, we would most graciously
request an audience with Gatto.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.602
[grunts]

08:39.686 --> 08:41.020
[Blinky gasps]

08:45.025 --> 08:46.901
Thank you, kind friend.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.780
[grunts]

08:55.577 --> 08:57.203
[faint car alarm blaring]

08:58.288 --> 08:59.622
[car door slams]

09:00.749 --> 09:05.336
-You bring news?
-They're going to Gatto's Keep.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.796
For what purpose?

09:06.880 --> 09:11.843
I wasn't close enough to see,
but they seek one of his treasures.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.012
I know of Gatto.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.639
If the hunter is foolish enough
to deal with him,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.641
I doubt they will return.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.187
Did you bring the charm I require?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.522
Do you know what to do with it?

09:24.606 --> 09:27.984
Don't patronize me. Of course I do.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.194
How does it work?

09:29.277 --> 09:31.571
Once you both drink its essence,

09:31.654 --> 09:35.283
then the woman's fate
will be tied to yours.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.623
He just keeps disappearing on me
for hours at a time.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.959
And today, I told him he was grounded.
And then he walked right past me.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.630
As if I had no say in the matter.
I just-- I don't know what to do.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.926
-You're doing the best you can.
-I just feel like I'm losing control.

09:53.009 --> 09:58.181
Barbara, sometimes, you have to focus
on what you <i>can </i> control

09:58.264 --> 09:59.599
over what you can't.

09:59.682 --> 10:03.394
I know, Walter. You're right. Thank you.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.523
I really like spending time with you.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.276
-[ringtone tinkles]
-Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.861
-It's the hospital.
-Of course.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.083
Well, I do have to get back to work,
but I've got a few more minutes.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.674
Mmm. This tea is really nice.

10:32.757 --> 10:37.428
Yes. I'd say it has a certain
<i>enchanting </i> quality to it.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.765
[Toby whimpers]

10:43.560 --> 10:45.436
[gasps]

10:45.520 --> 10:46.729
Finally!

10:48.940 --> 10:50.233
[Toby whimpers] Are you serious?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.402
Okay, where's Gatto?
They said he'd be here.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.238
Gatto's a real butt-snack.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.281
-[rumbling]
-[Toby gasps]

10:56.364 --> 11:01.369
-[voice echoes] Who has awakened Gatto?
-Oh, no!

11:01.452 --> 11:04.956
-Holy sheesh-kebob!
-I am so sorry I called you a butt-snack.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.040
[Gatto chuckles]

11:06.666 --> 11:11.379
A human Trollhunter? How interesting.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.882
How unique.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.010
[laughs]

11:20.555 --> 11:25.602
To what do I owe this pleasure?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.438
We've-- sorry, we've come for...

11:32.233 --> 11:33.109
-[slurps]
-[troll yells]

11:36.237 --> 11:40.074
-Agh! Did he just eat a troll?
-You must excuse me.

11:40.158 --> 11:46.664
I never talk business
without something to eat. Go on.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.958
We need-- we need the Birthstone.

11:49.042 --> 11:49.959
[laughing]

11:51.044 --> 11:54.339
The Birthstone of Gunmar.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.175
Very powerful.

11:57.258 --> 12:01.137
Why should I give it to you?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.348
Because we are going to destroy him.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.684
[laughs] Why do I care?

12:06.768 --> 12:11.648
Why should I give it to <i>you?</i>

12:11.731 --> 12:15.652
-He's negotiating, Master Jim.
-What do you want for it?

12:15.735 --> 12:20.490
Ooh. An answer to a little riddle.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.785
That's all? Whew.
I thought Claire was a goner.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.997
Answer it correctly,
the Birthstone is yours.

12:28.081 --> 12:33.503
Answer it <i>incorrectly, </i> I eat you all.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.837
[laughing]

12:36.255 --> 12:39.968
-Eat? Did he say "eat"?
-Yes, humans.

12:40.051 --> 12:44.430
[slurps] I hear they have a gamey taste.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.182
He said "eat." [moans]

12:46.265 --> 12:48.309
Master Jim, we must not enter
into this binding agreement.

12:48.393 --> 12:52.647
I'm beginning to catch on why
so few trolls ever leave this domicile.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.731
We'll play.

12:53.815 --> 12:54.816
[Toby gasps]

12:54.899 --> 12:58.528
We need it to save Claire's brother
and, besides, she's good at riddles.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.656
-Not "bet-our-lives" good!
-You're a straight-A student!

13:01.739 --> 13:05.660
-When do we go to "riddles" class?
-Ah, I am savvy with words.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.496
Gatto, do your worst. Riddle away.

13:08.579 --> 13:12.208
What begins and has no end,

13:12.291 --> 13:16.170
and ends all that which begins?

13:17.005 --> 13:21.718
I have absolutely no idea.
Those words mean nothing. Indecipherable.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.594
Everyone, start thinking. We can do this!

13:23.678 --> 13:25.138
"What begins, has no end..."

13:25.221 --> 13:29.225
Begin, end. Begin, end. Oh, head hurts!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.644
School bus? Meatloaf? Hair!

13:31.728 --> 13:35.523
-Ten more seconds.
-You didn't tell us we're on the clock!

13:35.606 --> 13:37.316
Kangaroo! Golf! Socks!

13:37.400 --> 13:39.694
Magic! Warhammer! Baby deer!

13:39.777 --> 13:42.780
School buses with hobos driving full
of macaroni and cheese! I don't know!

13:42.864 --> 13:45.241
A loop begins and has no end,
but it doesn't end when it begins.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.784
Shoot, it's not that. What is it?

13:46.868 --> 13:50.246
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
The answer is a riddle!

13:50.329 --> 13:52.749
No, that's stupid.
Could you repeat the question?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.836
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Five seconds.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.755
Prepare the <i>chimichurri!</i>

13:58.838 --> 14:01.966
There is no answer. The answer is nothing.
What if there is no answer?

14:02.050 --> 14:04.218
-There's always an answer.
-Then what is it?

14:04.302 --> 14:05.595
-"What has a beginning...?"
-You know this.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.306
-[Gatto] Three, two, one.
-You have to know this. We're gonna die!

14:08.389 --> 14:11.476
-Time is up.
-Death! Death is the answer.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.772
It begins and has no end.
And ends all things that begin. "Death."

14:15.855 --> 14:19.275
What? No one has ever
answered that before.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.069
-[Jim] Oh, my gosh!
-Yeah!

14:21.152 --> 14:25.073
-And lived to tell about it.
-[Jim] No!

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
You were never going to give it to us!

14:29.035 --> 14:32.747
You horde treasures
only to lure those into your literal trap!

14:32.830 --> 14:36.834
Oh, come now.
A mountain has to eat, you know.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.086
[gurgles]

14:38.169 --> 14:40.630
[Jim] For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

14:41.547 --> 14:43.299
-[grunts]
-Oh-hh!

14:43.383 --> 14:47.011
-[Claire] What do we do now?
-I don't wanna be food!

14:47.095 --> 14:48.262
-Hold on!
-Master Jim!

14:48.346 --> 14:50.681
No! [grunts]

14:50.765 --> 14:52.392
Aaarrrgghh!!!

14:52.475 --> 14:55.478
Wingman! Blinky!

14:55.561 --> 14:56.562
[growls]

14:56.646 --> 14:58.940
-He ate them!
-They still could be alive.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.110
Coach Lawrence told us how long it takes
to digest something, or someone.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.363
-That doesn't make it better!
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Must leave!

15:10.034 --> 15:11.285
-[Claire yelps]
-[Gatto howls]

15:11.369 --> 15:13.121
[Jim] Come on! Let's get out of here!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.622
[Gatto groaning]

15:15.957 --> 15:17.250
Get them!

15:18.167 --> 15:19.460
[yelling]

15:21.254 --> 15:22.713
[grunting]

15:24.715 --> 15:25.925
[Toby screams]

15:26.008 --> 15:28.803
We appear surprisingly unscathed
by that ordeal.

15:28.886 --> 15:33.057
Unscathed? We're in a stomach right now!
I feel very "scathed"!

15:33.141 --> 15:36.477
Great Gronka Morka!
Gatto's Keep-- it's his belly!

15:36.561 --> 15:39.188
That means the Birthstone
must be here somewhere.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.442
Yeah, along with a bunch of lava acid,
that's rising!

15:42.525 --> 15:43.568
Then we should make haste!

15:43.651 --> 15:46.320
Contact Jim!
Tell him we have found Gatto's Keep.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.240
What? I don't have an international plan.
The rates will be crazy!

15:49.323 --> 15:52.076
[snaps] I'll cover the charges!

15:54.078 --> 15:57.206
[Jim] They're okay!
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Wingman, Blinky, okay?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.208
Yeah, they say they're going
for the Birthstone,

15:59.292 --> 16:01.127
and they're gonna try to find a way out!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.171
Good! You're alive! Happy face!

16:03.254 --> 16:04.964
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

16:05.256 --> 16:06.257
[Claire] Tell them to meet at the gyre!

16:07.175 --> 16:08.384
Look at all this gold!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.970
Careful, Tobias. I encourage you
to keep your hands to yourself.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.139
We're already in a stomach.
What's the worst that can happen?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.433
Boils and disembowelment, for starters.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.268
Magically cursed objects
are often disguised

16:17.351 --> 16:20.271
as the most ordinary items
to lure unsuspecting victims...

16:20.354 --> 16:24.150
Oh, glorious me, a Roman penny!
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.235
Uh...

16:26.319 --> 16:28.905
-[coin clinks]
-Gunmar's Birthstone must be here.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.949
Okay. Let's see,
if I was a Birthstone, where would I be?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.117
[rumbling]

16:33.201 --> 16:36.162
Forget about the Birthstone!
We must leave now!

16:36.245 --> 16:37.371
[Blinky] Make haste!

16:38.372 --> 16:41.918
We can't possibly climb out of here.
I'm afraid we are without an exit.

16:42.001 --> 16:42.877
[splashing]

16:44.128 --> 16:45.254
[pops]

16:45.338 --> 16:48.508
Blinky, there may be another way,
but you're not gonna like it.

16:48.591 --> 16:52.053
If this is his stomach,
then there must be a "back door" too.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.763
"Back door"? What is...?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.307
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.769
If we upset the stomach, we may have
a chance to be passed through.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.940
I'd rather die in a stomach than go out
through a-- an alternate route.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.942
Come on, help me out!

17:07.818 --> 17:08.653
[gurgles, splashes]

17:10.238 --> 17:12.823
Throw in every gut-buster you can find!

17:12.906 --> 17:13.741
[Toby coughing]

17:18.663 --> 17:20.122
[grunts]

17:20.915 --> 17:22.833
-[gas spurting]
-[Blinky coughing]

17:23.416 --> 17:27.588
-Blinky? Are you okay?
-[squeaks] I'm okay, I'm okay.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.091
Sounds like it's just helium-based.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.093
[normal voice] Oh, dear.
Good thing that wasn't permanent.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.511
Is that...?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.597
[coins jingling]

17:37.181 --> 17:38.933
-Blinky?
-Have you found it?

17:41.269 --> 17:42.103
[humming]

17:42.186 --> 17:45.606
-Strange.
-They found the Birthstone!

17:47.400 --> 17:51.362
-"Meet you at the gyre." Send!
-[Claire] Jim! Watch out!

17:54.615 --> 17:55.866
-[crackles]
-[Gatto moans]

17:55.950 --> 17:57.618
Oh, no!

17:59.537 --> 18:00.663
Hurry!

18:02.790 --> 18:03.958
[Gatto] Get them!

18:04.041 --> 18:05.876
[Toby yells]

18:05.960 --> 18:07.420
It's not working!
We need something more,

18:07.503 --> 18:09.964
something that will really upset
his stomach.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.592
-We must move!
-We can use this! Hop on!

18:12.675 --> 18:14.552
We're not gonna get out of here, are we?

18:14.635 --> 18:18.598
I fear we are doomed, Tobias!
And that this will be our final...

18:18.681 --> 18:20.057
[munching]

18:24.770 --> 18:28.733
-What? I'm stress eating. Don't judge.
-Tobias, your tacos!

18:28.816 --> 18:31.736
My tacos? Are you crazy?
What are my tacos gonna do?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.237
Tobias, I've had your tacos.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.198
I know what they do
to the insides of a troll.

18:36.282 --> 18:40.995
-No! Those were Diablo Maximus!
-Oh, dear. And that's the one.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.496
[spurts]

18:43.205 --> 18:44.123
[Toby yelps]

18:44.206 --> 18:47.668
Uh-oh. Not tacos.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.462
[Toby yelling]

18:49.545 --> 18:51.255
[gasps]

18:51.339 --> 18:53.924
Blinky! The back door, it's open!

18:54.008 --> 18:57.011
I hate to repeat myself, but it might be
apropos. Let's burn some tunnel!

18:57.094 --> 18:58.512
[Blinky yells]

18:59.138 --> 19:01.557
Jim, get to the gyre!
We're coming out the back door!

19:01.641 --> 19:04.310
Whoa! Stop! Got it!

19:04.393 --> 19:08.606
-Smiley face, smiley face and send!
-[Blinky] Hold on!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.442
Where did the rest of the trolls go
that were here?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.195
I think they knew this place
was gonna blow.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.112
[ringtone chimes]

19:15.196 --> 19:16.656
Okay, Toby says they're gonna go
out the back door.

19:16.739 --> 19:20.201
-What's the back door? Oh...
-There they are!

19:20.284 --> 19:21.827
Start it up! Start it up!

19:21.911 --> 19:22.870
[Blinky groans]

19:22.953 --> 19:24.288
[Blinky] Start it up!

19:28.959 --> 19:30.002
[Toby screaming]

19:30.086 --> 19:31.671
[Blinky, Toby screaming]

19:32.171 --> 19:35.508
Leave it to me!
You infernal piece of... agh-hh!

19:35.591 --> 19:36.425
Aaarrrgghh!!!

19:37.218 --> 19:39.178
Hate gyre!

19:39.345 --> 19:40.179
[yells, thumps]

19:40.262 --> 19:42.181
[Toby screams]

19:44.225 --> 19:45.309
[hums]

19:45.393 --> 19:47.269
Never in my wildest dreams

19:47.353 --> 19:49.563
did I dare think
I would ever see such a sight.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.524
I'm never gonna look at food
the same way again.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.152
Indeed. We were all quite
the intrepid heroes today

19:55.236 --> 19:58.989
but a special accolade to you,
fair Claire, master of riddles.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.074
It was a team effort.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.159
Besides, we still have
two more stones to find.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.371
-The next ones might not be so easy.
-Easy? We were eaten!

20:05.454 --> 20:07.623
I'm pretty sure
I was technically digested and then...

20:07.707 --> 20:10.292
Tobias! The less said
about our escape, the better.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.337
Gorgus forbid we are remembered
for <i>that </i> in the history.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.715
-[spurts]
-[laughs]

20:15.798 --> 20:17.883
-That was almost grosser than--
-Don't say it!

20:17.967 --> 20:19.760
-You okay, Blinky?
-I'll be fine.

20:19.844 --> 20:23.180
Seems I may have been allergic
to something in Gatto's belly.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.890
But nothing a good night's rest won't fix.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.392
-Ah-hh-choo!
-[spurts]

20:26.475 --> 20:27.727
[troll waiter mutters]

20:27.810 --> 20:31.021
-Ooh! Are these salty niblets?
-What happened to never eating again?

20:31.105 --> 20:33.983
This is troll food, not human food.
There's a difference.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.900
-Mmm.
-[cat screeches]

20:34.984 --> 20:37.069
Not horrible. Mmm!

20:38.195 --> 20:39.613
[laughing]

20:56.088 --> 20:58.215
Young Atlas, is that...?

20:58.299 --> 21:00.634
-[flashes]
-Uh.

21:00.718 --> 21:06.140
-If I ever see you near her again...
-I expected this time would come.

21:06.223 --> 21:10.728
Oh, yeah? Give me one good reason
not to do away with you right now.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.898
Did you happen to spot my companion
watching you the other day?

21:13.981 --> 21:16.066
He's my assassin with...

21:16.150 --> 21:19.820
how should I put this?
Enchanting abilities.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.077
That was you?
What do you mean "enchanting"?

21:27.161 --> 21:30.998
He entwined your mother's fate with mine.

21:31.081 --> 21:34.794
Any harm you do to me
will be done to your mother.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.629
[faint ring]

21:36.712 --> 21:38.130
Ouch.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.799
[Barbara] Ow!

21:40.758 --> 21:42.051
How did that happen?

21:42.134 --> 21:42.968
Oh.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.388
[Strickler] What strange magic.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.306
Mm.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.100
What happens to me happens to her.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.854
You've hurt your mother enough, Jim.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.649
So, what will it be?

22:06.492 --> 22:07.743
Huh.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.953
[sneezes, spurts] Oh!

22:10.037 --> 22:10.871
Hm?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.251
[gasps]
Great Grumbly-Gruesome!
