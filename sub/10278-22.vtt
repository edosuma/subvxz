E. R.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.836
Previously on E. R.

00:07.837 --> 00:09.793
We had something.

00:11.844 --> 00:14.256
- Are you his mother?
- Neighbour. He's a friend of my son's.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.348
- Any way to contact the parents?
- He just has a father. I left a message.

00:17.383 --> 00:20.466
We found some unusual bruising
on your son, Mr. Fossen.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.290
- Do you know about that?
- No.

00:22.291 --> 00:25.101
I'm afraid Ben's gonna have to stay
here for a few days, Mr. Fossen.

00:25.102 --> 00:27.957
What?
You're not doing this to us!

00:27.958 --> 00:30.425
- No! Dad! Please!
- You bastard!

00:30.560 --> 00:31.478
Please!

00:31.479 --> 00:32.842
You're returning my application?

00:32.843 --> 00:35.939
Did you honestly think
that you'd make the first cut?

00:38.006 --> 00:40.839
E. R. 7x22 "RAMPAGE"

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.204 --> 01:01.995
How'd she do?

01:02.164 --> 01:06.373
Up from 3:30 to 6.
Then she wanted to feed at 7.

01:06.541 --> 01:09.327
Lie down. Take a nap.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.908
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

01:14.212 --> 01:16.251
Please don't go.

01:16.422 --> 01:18.294
I have to.

01:26.678 --> 01:29.048
I want you to stay.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.259
So do I.

01:32.514 --> 01:34.470
Can't you call in sick?

01:34.640 --> 01:37.723
- I wish I could.
- Just do it.

01:50.483 --> 01:52.853
I'll leave the van.

02:06.951 --> 02:08.741
What was that?

02:08.910 --> 02:11.945
It's 8:00. They're demolishing
the old textile building on State.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.112
That'll wake you up.

02:24.461 --> 02:28.042
Exactly our problem. They blow up
a manufacturing plant to build a mall.

02:28.213 --> 02:30.169
What's wrong with a mall?

02:30.840 --> 02:31.953
Fifty cents.

02:32.132 --> 02:35.297
All we do is buy and sell.
We don't produce nothing.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.292
See? What do you do?

02:37.467 --> 02:39.424
- What?
- For a living?

02:39.594 --> 02:42.215
- I'm a doctor.
- Okay. Bad example.

02:42.388 --> 02:44.379
What are you talking about?
You're building the mall.

02:44.556 --> 02:45.966
Not for long.

02:54.394 --> 02:56.966
Mark Ainsley, 12 years old.
GSW through the upper left arm.

02:57.146 --> 02:59.387
- Is the neuro-circ still intact?
- Complains of pain and paresthesia.

02:59.564 --> 03:01.022
- Can you squeeze my hand?
- It hurts.

03:01.189 --> 03:03.680
- What happened?
- Open fire in a foster-care facility.

03:03.858 --> 03:05.138
- Foster care?
- Twelve down.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.976
- Can you feel this?
- A little.

03:07.151 --> 03:09.060
- Think about a vascular study.
- Got it.

03:09.236 --> 03:11.940
Mark! Mark! Take that one. Go!

03:13.572 --> 03:16.488
- It's still in me. It still hurts.
- We're gonna help you out.

03:16.657 --> 03:19.325
Entrance wound only.
Palpable in the sub-Q. Got this, Dave?

03:19.492 --> 03:21.234
As long as there's no
compartment syndrome.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.532
- I can't breathe.
- Slow your breathing down.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.991
Maria Fredrikkson,
with significant blood loss.

03:26.163 --> 03:28.912
BP, 90/palp. Tachy at 120.

03:29.081 --> 03:31.653
- Any belly pain, ma'am?
- No. My leg is cold.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.990
- Foot pulses are diminished.
- Did they get him?

03:34.167 --> 03:36.076
- Who?
- The man with the gun.

03:36.252 --> 03:39.370
- I don't know. Did you see him?
- We were hiding in a closet.

03:39.545 --> 03:43.328
- But he just shot through the door.
- Foot is pale. Poor capillary refill.

03:43.506 --> 03:46.126
- Trauma 1, coming through!
- Who's on for Trauma?

03:46.299 --> 03:49.833
- We're bringing everybody in!
- Two more of saline, order pre-op labs.

03:50.010 --> 03:52.581
- Doesn't she have an ischemic leg?
- Get through to Surgery!

03:52.760 --> 03:55.677
- We have an 8-year-old girl in arrest.
- Where was she hit?

03:55.846 --> 03:59.213
Shot in the head. Intubated.
Bradyed down to 30, then lost her pulse.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.677
- Pupils fixed and dilated.
- P.E.A. Let's get her epi.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.888
You just get here? Nice way to start.

04:04.059 --> 04:06.430
Well, I was gonna call in sick.

04:08.061 --> 04:09.969
E. R.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.921
Dr. Weaver, gluteal gunshot wound.
He needs a cystourethrogram.

05:01.091 --> 05:03.498
- Try a rigid sigmoidoscopy.
- He should see a surgeon.

05:03.676 --> 05:05.752
Yeah, get in line. Where's Benton?

05:05.928 --> 05:07.919
- Charge to 60.
- You getting a rhythm?

05:08.095 --> 05:10.929
Degenerated into V-fib. Clear.

05:11.932 --> 05:14.717
Another 120.
Looks like brain-stem failure.

05:14.891 --> 05:18.305
104's on the radio with the last one.
GSW to the chest.

05:18.477 --> 05:19.935
- Is he hypotensive?
- No change.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.181
-120 again.
- No.

05:21.353 --> 05:23.641
- Fine. Bring him in.
- Is it the same gunman?

05:23.813 --> 05:26.303
Yeah. He shot the gardener
on his way out.

05:26.565 --> 05:27.939
Clear.

05:28.775 --> 05:32.189
- Surprised he had any bullets left.
- Push another. 3 of epi.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.849
- Want to try mannitol?
- Couldn't hurt. 30 grams.

05:35.027 --> 05:38.477
- Do you need an angiogram?
- No, I don't think so. No bruit or thrill.

05:39.364 --> 05:40.822
Is that Helen?

05:40.989 --> 05:42.816
- Who?
- Helen. She's new.

05:42.991 --> 05:45.527
Foster-mom bailed on her.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.659
I don't know.

05:48.285 --> 05:50.491
- Clear!
- Expanding hematoma.

05:51.037 --> 05:53.278
No pulse deficit.
They catch the guy yet?

05:53.455 --> 05:56.574
- No. Dispatch doesn't know anything.
- He was mad at Mrs. Buckley.

05:56.749 --> 05:57.827
What's that?

05:57.999 --> 06:00.869
He was waving the gun at Mrs. Buckley,
yelling, then shot her.

06:01.043 --> 06:03.248
- Did we get a Mrs. Buckley?
- DOA.

06:03.836 --> 06:05.792
Gram of cefazolin,
follow with neuro exam.

06:05.962 --> 06:10.753
We've also got a GSW to the lateral
malleolus in Exam 2 still waiting.

06:10.923 --> 06:14.622
Portable x-ray and a Doppler scope. Make
sure the bullet didn't damage the bone.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.592
Go ahead. I got this.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.417
Let's get an AP lateral
to the left humerus.

06:19.594 --> 06:20.970
- Did you turn it in?
- What?

06:21.138 --> 06:23.972
Weaver said my application was
incomplete. Missing my peer reference.

06:24.139 --> 06:26.510
- Right, yeah. I'll do that today.
- It's due today.

06:26.682 --> 06:28.970
- Yeah. I'll do it.
- Okay, thanks.

06:29.142 --> 06:30.172
I need you here!

06:30.351 --> 06:32.639
Femoral artery's pumping blood.
I can't control it without my finger in it.

06:32.810 --> 06:36.225
Get me surgeons. I got three unstable
patients and a fourth coming in.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.637
Anspaugh's gonna take this one.
I'll be back.

06:39.314 --> 06:40.773
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

06:40.941 --> 06:44.308
Officer Napolitano. I need someone
to pull out a bullet for the crime lab.

06:44.484 --> 06:45.764
- Which patient?
- Calf wound.

06:45.943 --> 06:47.651
He's stable. We'll get to him soon.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.692
- As long as we get evidence.
- Find the shooter.

06:49.862 --> 06:51.142
We'll get him.

06:51.322 --> 06:55.483
I was in the bathroom. I heard a loud
explosion. It scared me for a second.

06:55.657 --> 06:59.487
But then I remembered that they
were tearing down that building.

06:59.659 --> 07:01.533
Then I heard all this screaming, and...

07:01.703 --> 07:05.650
BP, 132/78. Pulse, 96.
He was out front in the bushes.

07:05.830 --> 07:08.154
Took us a while to find him.
We were inside.

07:08.331 --> 07:11.200
- Kerry, what happened?
- Lunatic shot at a foster-care facility.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.829
- Why?
- Who knows? Go. Curtain 3. Go!

07:14.001 --> 07:15.163
You were right to stay.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.373
I should have gone to help,
done something.

07:17.544 --> 07:19.869
No. You did the right thing.
I'll be right back.

07:20.046 --> 07:22.666
Can I get a cigarette?
I need a cigarette.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.997
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

07:26.008 --> 07:29.671
Kerry, I've got a hypotensive social
worker. Probably just stress...

07:29.843 --> 07:31.716
- ... but you should check it out.
- Thanks.

07:31.887 --> 07:33.463
Hello.

07:35.013 --> 07:37.763
- I read your letter.
- Good. I was wondering.

07:37.931 --> 07:40.386
Dr. Legaspi, Dr. Romano,
line three, for you.

07:40.558 --> 07:42.349
Tell him I'll call him back.

07:42.518 --> 07:43.927
She'll call you right back.

07:44.101 --> 07:48.891
Anyway, I appreciate the sentiment.

07:49.063 --> 07:50.142
"Sentiment"?

07:50.313 --> 07:54.179
He says for you to get on the line now.
He needs to talk to you about a transfer.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.807
She's busy. He should be too. We could
have as many as eight GSWs going.

07:57.984 --> 07:59.443
Nine. Carjack victim.

07:59.611 --> 08:02.360
We're swamped with this.
Tell them to divert to Mercy.

08:02.528 --> 08:04.319
Mercy said no ET As 9 to 10.

08:04.354 --> 08:06.520
Why do they bother calling?

08:06.948 --> 08:09.235
Anyway, thank you...

08:09.407 --> 08:13.356
...but I don't think
that anything's changed.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.695
Right. Okay.

08:16.996 --> 08:21.157
- Okay. I should get back.
- Yeah.

08:23.124 --> 08:26.040
Chuny, grab Cleo. The kid
she's with isn't gonna make it.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.323
Clear.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.917
Asystole.

08:30.753 --> 08:34.086
- How long has she been down?
- At least an hour since the shooting.

08:34.255 --> 08:37.504
Dr. Finch, can you take
a carjack victim rolling up?

08:37.756 --> 08:40.163
Go ahead. This is a fatal wound.

08:40.717 --> 08:43.385
- What is it?
- GSW to the abdomen.

08:43.552 --> 08:46.717
Someone should have told me
that today was gun day.

08:47.888 --> 08:51.505
Time of death, 9: 12.

09:01.188 --> 09:03.262
- This the carjacking?
- Yeah. Mr. Jeffries.

09:03.438 --> 09:05.763
GSW to the left lateral abdomen.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.644
- You need to be careful.
- He has AIDS.

09:08.817 --> 09:11.188
- How's his pressure?
-140/82.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.849
- Okay, good. That's good.
- What do you got?

09:14.027 --> 09:17.193
Entrance wound below the costal margin
and the anterior axillary line.

09:17.363 --> 09:19.651
No exit. Mr. Jeffries is HIV-positive.

09:19.823 --> 09:22.906
I was getting out of the car.
He shot me anyway.

09:23.908 --> 09:25.533
- Frank, what's open?
- Nothing.

09:25.701 --> 09:28.192
- I got a GSW.
- Don't make you special today.

09:28.370 --> 09:31.073
- Mark called in. Trauma 1.
- That's fine. Let's go.

09:31.246 --> 09:33.202
Let's set him up.
Get him a portable chest.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.403
- Hey!
- Roger?

09:36.082 --> 09:37.492
- Stay away from my wife!
- What?

09:37.666 --> 09:40.370
You stay away from my wife!
She told me everything.

09:40.543 --> 09:42.369
You had your chance.
She's my wife now.

09:42.544 --> 09:44.915
- I don't know what you're-
- I'll take care of Carla.

09:45.087 --> 09:47.411
- Frank, call Security!
- Get him out of here!

09:47.589 --> 09:49.213
- Stay away!
- I haven't touched her!

09:49.382 --> 09:51.503
- I'll kick your ass!
- Knock it off. Come on.

09:53.717 --> 09:54.748
Nothing happened.

09:54.926 --> 09:57.546
Chuny, get a trauma panel.
Type and cross for four.

09:57.719 --> 09:59.842
- He really nailed you.
- Mind your business!

10:00.013 --> 10:01.554
- Is this the carjacking?
- Yes.

10:01.721 --> 10:05.884
- Sir, I'm sorry about that.
- Sir? Sir, I'm Officer Napolitano.

10:06.058 --> 10:08.547
You told the officer
your assailant was Caucasian?

10:08.725 --> 10:11.216
- Yeah, that's right.
- Did he wear a yellow windbreaker?

10:11.394 --> 10:14.062
Yeah, you know.
How did you know that?

10:14.229 --> 10:17.229
I think he might have shot some people
at a foster-care facility.

10:17.398 --> 10:19.188
- Same guy?
- And...

10:19.356 --> 10:20.981
...three.

10:21.525 --> 10:24.229
- Can you remember your license plate?
- No.

10:24.401 --> 10:26.892
- Pressure's down to 90.
- Two liters saline, wide open.

10:27.070 --> 10:30.769
- But it's a black Acura Legend, correct?
- What's wrong?

10:30.947 --> 10:33.069
You'll have to do this later.
Check with DMV.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.073
- Might be bleeding in your abdomen.
- How do you know for sure?

10:36.241 --> 10:39.241
- Let's get an ultrasound in here.
- It's a black Acura Legend?

10:39.410 --> 10:40.738
What? Yeah.

10:40.911 --> 10:44.409
We have to put a tube in your chest
to help you breathe.

10:47.582 --> 10:48.861
Prep the chest.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.700
- You okay from here?
- Got it.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.495
- Lidocaine.
- Pulse ox, 98.

10:54.085 --> 10:56.373
- You almost missed your deadline.
- What?

10:58.421 --> 11:01.670
I was eating breakfast and saw
your med school reinstatement form...

11:01.840 --> 11:03.297
...on your counter.

11:03.465 --> 11:05.457
- What did you do?
- Ten blade.

11:05.633 --> 11:09.131
You were lucky. Lady in the registrar's
office has a daughter who is a nurse.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.380
The registrar's office?

11:10.552 --> 11:14.679
Told her you had a bunch of night shifts,
and she slipped it in with the others.

11:14.847 --> 11:16.222
-32 French.
- Wait.

11:16.389 --> 11:19.472
- You handed it in?
- Yeah. This morning.

11:19.641 --> 11:21.847
- Luka, why'd you do that?
- It was due Monday.

11:22.018 --> 11:24.590
- I didn't want to turn it in.
- I thought you forgot.

11:24.770 --> 11:26.891
- No. I changed my mind.
- Why?

11:27.062 --> 11:29.137
Now they'll come after me
for summer tuition.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.436
- I can help you with the money.
- I don't want help.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.891
- I just wanted to let it go.
- Then why did you fill it out?

11:35.067 --> 11:37.438
I'll get you some Xeroform.

11:40.111 --> 11:43.692
Lesion by the shoulder. The bullet passed
mid-shaft. This is much more proximal.

11:43.863 --> 11:45.690
Look at the lateral.
It's in front of the bone.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.986
- Could be soft-tissue sarcoma.
- Get a biopsy.

11:48.157 --> 11:50.826
- Is your kid stable?
- Yeah. I just have to do an FNA.

11:50.992 --> 11:53.565
Clear the room. Next round coming in.
Two more gunshot wounds.

11:53.744 --> 11:55.866
- One chest, one neck.
- Two more? It's not even 10:00.

11:56.037 --> 11:57.447
- It's the same guy again.
- What?

11:57.621 --> 12:00.823
CPD tracked a carjacked Acura
to a private residence.

12:00.998 --> 12:02.622
Found a mother and son shot inside.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.368
- Did they get the shooter?
- Not yet.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.617
- Do we have the ORs?
- Cleaning two now.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.619
- Peter still needs to go up.
- That leaves one.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.537
And Anspaugh
should be finishing soon.

12:10.712 --> 12:12.586
Psych nurses aren't trained
to handle ostomy care.

12:12.755 --> 12:14.545
If they need ostomy care,
he can check his own damn bag.

12:14.714 --> 12:16.457
We need you.
Two more GSWs rolling up.

12:16.632 --> 12:18.754
- In a minute.
- Abby, let's go outside.

12:18.925 --> 12:20.834
And when I call you,
you get on the phone!

12:21.010 --> 12:23.760
She was helping
with the mass casualty.

12:23.928 --> 12:27.130
I needed to clear Recovery for the barrage
of gunshot wounds you keep accepting!

12:27.305 --> 12:30.507
I'm not taking responsibility for post-op
complications in the psych ward!

12:30.682 --> 12:34.132
Well, then we'll have to find somebody
who's interested in responsibility.

12:34.309 --> 12:37.262
- What is that supposed to mean?
- DeRaad can finish your shift.

12:37.436 --> 12:39.642
- What?
- Nice knowing you.

12:41.271 --> 12:43.264
GSW through the right lateral neck.
Airway's clear.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.146
- What's his pressure?
-110/70.

12:45.315 --> 12:46.940
- Hi. What's your name?
- Ted.

12:47.108 --> 12:50.310
- Ted, can you swallow for me?
- Where's my mom?

12:50.485 --> 12:52.311
- Is all this his?
- Dr. Greene?

12:52.486 --> 12:55.818
No. His mom was wrapped around him.
The bullet went through her into his neck.

12:55.988 --> 12:57.151
- Mommy!
- Dr. Greene.

12:57.322 --> 13:00.157
Get Dr. Weaver to scope him.
He may need an esophagram.

13:00.324 --> 13:03.074
We're gonna take you inside.
Okay, Ted?

13:03.242 --> 13:06.609
I think this is the lady that brought in
your abused kid last week.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.869
Simple gunshot wound to the back.
BP, 128/74.

13:10.037 --> 13:12.990
- Mrs. Shayatovich.
- Where's Ted? Where's Ted?

13:13.164 --> 13:15.287
He's gonna be okay.
There's another doctor looking at him.

13:15.458 --> 13:19.323
Please, help him. He was bleeding.
His neck was bleeding.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.494
Who shot you, Mrs. Shayatovich?

13:21.670 --> 13:24.373
Derek. I told the policeman
it was Derek Fossen.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.289
Your neighbor.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.586
He was looking for Ben.
I told him I didn't know where he was.

13:28.757 --> 13:32.705
He said if I was gonna take his boy away
he was gonna take mine from me.

13:32.884 --> 13:35.552
Please, please help him.
He was bleeding.

13:35.719 --> 13:39.169
We're gonna take care of him.
Let's get a HemoCue and a pulse ox.

13:39.346 --> 13:40.839
Roll her, roll her, roll her!

13:43.223 --> 13:45.215
Oh, God! That looks like
about two liters.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.845
May be an aorta-esophageal fistula.

13:48.018 --> 13:49.677
- She's out.
- Okay, bag her.

13:49.852 --> 13:51.132
I'll intubate her inside.

13:51.311 --> 13:55.059
Get a thoracotomy tray
and all the O-negative we got.

13:57.606 --> 13:59.978
Fossen. Derek Fossen. F-O-S-S-E-N.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.604
Looks like it was contained until it
blew through the esophagus.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.732
- Do you have an address?
- He lives next door to her.

14:04.902 --> 14:07.855
- Can't get a pressure.
- Squeeze in two units of O-neg.

14:08.029 --> 14:09.060
I'm in.

14:09.905 --> 14:13.107
We put his son into protective custody.
His name is Ben.

14:13.282 --> 14:15.238
He should be somewhere
in the foster-care system.

14:15.409 --> 14:17.649
- Lost the pulse.
- All right. Rib spreader.

14:17.868 --> 14:20.156
Find the son.
That's who he's looking for.

14:20.328 --> 14:22.367
Abby, get the infuser.

14:22.913 --> 14:24.655
Pressure's up to 120 after two liters.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.573
- Do you need this?
- No.

14:26.748 --> 14:28.656
Liver and spleen are intact.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.326
So maybe I'm not bleeding.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.417
No. You've got a slow leak
from a small vessel.

14:33.586 --> 14:35.826
- You're gonna need surgery.
- I don't want surgery.

14:36.004 --> 14:39.786
Look, we'll make a midline incision, find
the bleeding artery and then tie it off.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.837
Doc, I'm already dying.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.505
Your infection might slow your recovery
but it's routine surgery.

14:45.675 --> 14:47.170
People live with HIV.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.711
I know that. I've been fighting
this disease since 1986.

14:50.887 --> 14:54.835
I responded to the AZT, and the
protease inhibitors were a miracle.

14:55.556 --> 14:58.177
They gave me an extra five years.

14:58.350 --> 15:01.931
But my T cells have been
dropping since July.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.516
My viral load's gone through the roof,
even with all these antivirals.

15:06.354 --> 15:09.804
Mr. Jeffries, I need your consent.

15:10.315 --> 15:12.022
No.

15:12.191 --> 15:14.681
I had pneumocystis three months ago.

15:14.859 --> 15:19.566
- If we don't operate, you'll die.
- I am already dead, doc.

15:19.737 --> 15:23.947
This may just allow me to skip
a very painful end.

15:27.325 --> 15:29.316
- Another Satinsky.
- Unit eight is up.

15:29.492 --> 15:33.867
- Heart's not filling. Clamp the aorta.
- Greene, the injury is high and posterior.

15:34.037 --> 15:36.112
- Just trying to bring you more light.
- That'll help.

15:36.288 --> 15:38.695
- Can't you get your finger in the hole?
- If I could see it.

15:38.873 --> 15:40.035
More light.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.246
- Just call for FFP and platelets.
- Forget it, forget it.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.823
- I can't close this defect.
- Another amp of epi.

15:45.002 --> 15:48.286
She'll go out of thoracic aorta
and exsanguinate in seconds.

15:48.462 --> 15:51.213
- Let's try bypass.
- It's too late for that. Call it.

15:53.048 --> 15:55.289
Time of death, 11:40.

15:56.174 --> 15:58.925
0 for 2 and it's not even lunch.

16:05.055 --> 16:08.339
We pull the sample out with a needle.
And then we look under a microscope.

16:08.515 --> 16:12.381
- You think it's cancer?
- It could be scar tissue. Or a cyst.

16:12.559 --> 16:14.799
Cancer's only one possibility.

16:14.976 --> 16:16.684
My mom died of cancer.

16:16.853 --> 16:20.635
- How old was she?
-35. I'm 12.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.890
Let's see the biopsy first. That way
we can talk about what we know...

16:25.065 --> 16:27.141
...as opposed to what we don't know.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.226
Do you have anybody
that you'd like me to call?

16:29.402 --> 16:32.069
- I'm in foster care.
- Yeah, I know. Foster parents?

16:32.237 --> 16:35.070
- No. I'm between homes.
- Right.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.525
- She make it?
- No.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.320
- This guy's on a rampage.
- They didn't catch him yet?

16:43.493 --> 16:46.114
I don't know.
They're gonna go to his house.

16:46.745 --> 16:48.736
So much violence, huh?

16:52.414 --> 16:54.869
- Were you gonna tell me?
- Tell you what?

16:55.041 --> 16:57.366
- I heard a rumor.
- Oh, yeah? A good one?

16:57.543 --> 16:59.582
Dr. Rosen called.

17:00.461 --> 17:03.663
You know, from the emergency
department at Northwestern.

17:03.838 --> 17:07.170
- You took the message?
- He wanted to set up an appointment.

17:08.507 --> 17:10.713
- Just looking at options.
- Are you leaving?

17:11.592 --> 17:13.384
I still have to make up
three months of my residency.

17:13.551 --> 17:16.006
- Well, after that?
- I don't know.

17:17.054 --> 17:19.340
I'm not even being considered
for Chief Resident.

17:19.512 --> 17:22.714
I have to write this damn
peer review for Chen.

17:22.890 --> 17:26.424
They're not even talking me
about an Attending position.

17:26.601 --> 17:29.091
Have you talked to Weaver
about an Attending position?

17:29.269 --> 17:30.929
- No.
- Why not?

17:31.312 --> 17:33.683
Because if she wanted me,
she would have asked me about it.

17:33.856 --> 17:35.432
Maybe she doesn't
think you're interested.

17:35.815 --> 17:37.890
Maybe I'm not.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.311
Carter, is your cirrhosis patient
ready to go to the floor?

17:41.485 --> 17:43.275
No. I have to do a paracentesis first.

17:43.444 --> 17:45.187
- We need the bed.
- Got it.

17:45.362 --> 17:47.899
What's the chest tube output
on the gardener?

17:48.072 --> 17:51.404
300 cc's. He's third in line for a tele.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.777
- You still angry at me?
- I wasn't angry.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.786
- You seemed angry.
- It's my fault. I should have ripped it up.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.495
I thought you wanted
to go back to school.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.322
Maybe I do. Just not now.

18:03.497 --> 18:05.205
- What happened?
- Nothing.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.946
You don't want to be
a doctor anymore?

18:08.125 --> 18:09.156
I don't know.

18:09.334 --> 18:11.159
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

18:11.794 --> 18:14.365
It's $40,000 in tuition.
It's lost wages.

18:14.545 --> 18:16.916
It's another six years
of me killing myself.

18:17.088 --> 18:19.080
Then it's over and you'll be
doing what you want.

18:19.256 --> 18:20.749
Maybe I'm doing what I want.

18:20.923 --> 18:23.330
If that were true,
you would have never started.

18:23.509 --> 18:27.291
Maybe I realized being a nurse is good
enough. Is it not good enough for you?

18:27.469 --> 18:29.710
No, no. It's fine.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.468
Okay. You did great, Ted.

18:36.641 --> 18:39.724
The bullet went through a muscle
in your neck. But you're gonna be okay.

18:39.893 --> 18:43.806
- Can I see my mom now?
- Let me find out.

18:43.979 --> 18:46.303
- Do you know your dad's work number?
- No.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.804
- Okay. Do you know where he works?
- Abysco.

18:48.982 --> 18:51.897
- Abysco? Is that a company?
- He makes binders.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.900
He makes binders. All right.
You want to draw some more?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.144
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

19:05.032 --> 19:09.194
- The mom didn't make it?
- The proximal aorta was shredded.

19:09.368 --> 19:12.403
I have to track down his father.
What do you want to tell the boy?

19:12.578 --> 19:15.364
- I'll stall.
- Dr. Greene?

19:18.998 --> 19:20.243
This him?

19:21.833 --> 19:23.625
Yeah. He has a record?

19:23.793 --> 19:26.413
One arrest. Domestic dispute.
He hit his girlfriend.

19:26.586 --> 19:28.377
He wasn't at his house?

19:28.546 --> 19:31.499
- I'll let you know when we have him.
- What about his son?

19:31.673 --> 19:35.087
We tracked down the foster parents.
A patrol car's picking him up now.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.131
- I think he's coming here.
- What?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.834
Well, he was pissed at the neighbor
for bringing him to the ER.

19:41.011 --> 19:44.011
- You took his kid away from him, right?
- Right.

19:44.180 --> 19:47.095
- Thanks, Frank.
- I'll send in some extra units.

19:49.141 --> 19:52.888
Mark, he couldn't come here. He
knows there's too many cops around.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.301
He hasn't displayed a lot
of sound judgment so far.

19:55.478 --> 19:58.976
- What is he shooting with?
- Semiautomatic pistol, 13-round clip.

19:59.147 --> 20:02.348
- He's been reloading.
- Maybe picked it up at Kmart on the way.

20:02.523 --> 20:05.014
- It's not the guns. People kill people.
- Yeah, right.

20:05.192 --> 20:07.764
- But not as fast.
- He would have found another weapon.

20:07.944 --> 20:10.859
Fourteen shots so far, Frank.
Six deaths.

20:11.028 --> 20:14.360
You can't affect mass murder
with a Chinese throwing star.

20:14.531 --> 20:18.657
Rescue 78 coming in with an injured cop.
Motorist dragged him for half a block.

20:18.825 --> 20:20.697
There you go. He hit him with a car.

20:20.867 --> 20:24.069
- That's assault with a deadly weapon.
- Shut up!

20:24.244 --> 20:28.406
Free air under the diaphragm.
Must have nicked the bowel too.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.330
His crit's down to 23.
I can't dilute him much further.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.332
I checked his viral load.
It's over 50,000.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.204
He'll die of an opportunistic
infection within a year.

20:37.377 --> 20:40.542
Well, that doesn't mean we should
help him commit suicide.

20:41.045 --> 20:42.160
He didn't shoot himself.

20:42.338 --> 20:44.294
If we let him refuse surgery,
it's the same thing.

20:44.464 --> 20:47.796
- Get a court order then.
- He'll be dead by the time it's approved.

20:47.966 --> 20:50.005
Then it's his choice.

20:51.801 --> 20:53.295
All right.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.010
I went over there.

20:55.178 --> 20:57.929
She was upset. She was crying.

20:58.097 --> 21:02.306
She came on to me. I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to do anything.

21:02.475 --> 21:05.557
Maybe she felt guilty and she
told Roger and she put a spin on it.

21:05.726 --> 21:07.517
- And you wouldn't put a spin on it.
- No.

21:07.686 --> 21:08.716
Then why didn't you tell me?

21:08.894 --> 21:10.139
- To avoid this.
- What?

21:10.312 --> 21:11.474
You looking at me
like I did something wrong.

21:11.646 --> 21:15.144
I see. You didn't trust me
and I'm supposed to trust you.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.398
- I didn't think it was worth getting into.
- At least I know where I stand.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.436
Cleo, that's not what I meant
and you know it.

21:21.610 --> 21:24.017
- Peter, his pressure's dropping.
- Go.

21:25.071 --> 21:26.695
Run in another liter of saline.

21:26.864 --> 21:29.068
- Any chest pain or dizziness?
- No.

21:29.239 --> 21:32.358
Let's get two units from the blood bank
and transfuse each over an hour.

21:32.533 --> 21:35.486
No, no, no. I don't want
a blood transfusion.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.115
Your hematocrit is drifting
to a dangerously low level.

21:38.287 --> 21:39.863
I understand.

21:40.038 --> 21:42.243
No. Thank you.

21:43.873 --> 21:45.414
What about your family?

21:45.582 --> 21:49.080
I mean, if you don't care about yourself,
what about them?

21:49.251 --> 21:52.914
I haven't spoken to my mother
in over 30 years.

21:53.086 --> 21:55.837
I outlived the two people
that I loved in the world.

21:56.005 --> 21:59.123
I've lived longer than I expected.

22:00.174 --> 22:02.082
Just let me go.

22:02.259 --> 22:03.752
I'm ready.

22:18.143 --> 22:19.423
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:24.772 --> 22:27.475
- How are you feeling?
- My neck hurts.

22:27.648 --> 22:30.398
I'll ask one of the nurses to come
give you some medicine.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.605
Can I see my mom?

22:32.776 --> 22:35.313
Not yet. I'm trying to reach your dad.

22:35.486 --> 22:38.190
Can I stay with her until you do?

22:38.363 --> 22:41.397
I don't think so.
She's having an operation right now.

22:41.573 --> 22:43.315
Is she okay?

22:44.116 --> 22:49.109
We're having a little trouble trying to get
the bleeding stopped around her heart.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.950
- She was hurt bad.
- I know.

22:54.496 --> 22:57.283
- You hungry?
- No.

22:57.457 --> 22:58.915
- Where's all this blood from?
- Tore off part of his ear.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.280
Give him more pain medicine.

23:00.458 --> 23:03.127
Titrate 10 of morphine.
Did you lose consciousness?

23:03.294 --> 23:04.917
- I don't think so.
- Got him, Luka?

23:05.086 --> 23:06.366
Yeah. Trauma panel...

23:06.546 --> 23:07.743
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Not really.

23:07.921 --> 23:10.493
- Yellow windbreaker?
- Yeah. He saw blood on the collar.

23:10.673 --> 23:11.952
Fossen did this?

23:12.131 --> 23:14.835
- Just a minute.
- Colby asked him to step out.

23:15.008 --> 23:18.292
When he opened the door, the guy
smashed our unit and took off.

23:18.469 --> 23:22.464
Colby's jacket must've got snagged. He
was screaming. He got dragged forever.

23:22.638 --> 23:24.464
- He didn't stop.
- Where did he get the car?

23:24.639 --> 23:25.669
Probably boosted it.

23:25.848 --> 23:27.970
Jeep Grand Cherokee,
first three license numbers G74?

23:28.141 --> 23:29.600
- That's all I got down.
- Could it be G79?

23:29.767 --> 23:31.509
- You got him?
- Shots fired at 823 Piedmont.

23:31.685 --> 23:34.933
Jeep Grand Cherokee parked
at the corner. License number G79-6L5.

23:35.103 --> 23:37.676
- Woman found down inside.
- Oh, God. Here we go.

23:37.855 --> 23:40.771
- Easy. Is she dead?
- Called in the paramedics.

23:41.149 --> 23:42.642
We're all overworked, Robert.

23:42.816 --> 23:46.100
You can't insinuate you'll fire someone
every time you're frustrated.

23:46.276 --> 23:47.651
- I'm not. She's fired.
- Robert.

23:47.819 --> 23:51.068
- Cleaning out her locker right now.
- You can't do that.

23:51.238 --> 23:54.937
This is a county facility.
Employees cannot be summarily fired.

23:55.115 --> 23:57.439
She was already on probation
for that other matter.

23:57.616 --> 23:58.647
She was exonerated.

23:58.825 --> 24:01.611
And she's had a history of violation
of institutional policy.

24:01.785 --> 24:03.943
- Like what?
- What do you care?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.744
She's a good doctor.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.529
A good doctor who has had 30 delinquent
charts awaiting discharge summaries.

24:09.706 --> 24:12.540
- So does half the staff.
- She used the telephone watch line...

24:12.708 --> 24:14.451
- ... for personal calls.
- You're kidding!

24:14.626 --> 24:18.408
- She yelled at a patient in public.
- You're trying to find a way to fire her.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.705
There's plenty of documentation that
the disciplinary committee has reviewed.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.994
- Dr. Weaver.
- Give me a minute.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.417
- It's Adele. She's been shot.
- What?

24:24.590 --> 24:27.506
- That maniac shot her at her house.
- The social worker?

24:27.759 --> 24:30.330
Chest x-ray, T and L spine.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.593
- Get an ultrasound. Feel this?
- Yeah.

24:33.762 --> 24:36.512
Did you get a look at the man
who shot you?

24:36.680 --> 24:39.431
He looked familiar.
He said something about his son.

24:39.598 --> 24:42.515
We put his son Ben
into protective custody last week.

24:42.684 --> 24:45.256
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Adele, can you feel this?

24:45.435 --> 24:46.514
No.

24:46.686 --> 24:50.634
Cord injury, 1.8 grams Solu-Medrol
over 15 minutes.

24:50.813 --> 24:51.892
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

24:52.064 --> 24:54.269
She was shot mid-back.
She can't move her legs.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.432
White male, late 30s,
yellow windbreaker?

24:56.650 --> 24:58.938
Yeah. I think so.

24:59.110 --> 25:02.026
- Any pain in the belly?
- BP, 92/65. Pulse, 110.

25:02.195 --> 25:03.937
- Any pain in your belly?
- Not really.

25:04.112 --> 25:07.646
- Could be a pneumothorax.
- Lungs sound good. Pulse ox is 99.

25:07.823 --> 25:10.360
- For an intra-abdominal bleed?
- There's spinal shock.

25:10.533 --> 25:13.237
- How did he know where I lived?
- What?

25:13.410 --> 25:16.030
I only saw him at the hospital.

25:16.203 --> 25:19.119
- They can find anything on the Internet.
- What?

25:19.288 --> 25:21.694
- Get someone over to my house.
- What?

25:21.872 --> 25:26.248
Send someone over to my house now.
1211 Dupont Drive.

25:30.711 --> 25:33.462
[***]

25:40.800 --> 25:42.377
She's still hypotensive.
Want dopamine?

25:42.551 --> 25:44.093
Start her on five mics.

25:45.219 --> 25:46.844
Come on, Elizabeth. Pick up.

25:47.929 --> 25:49.253
Pick up.

25:51.570 --> 25:53.728
- Does this feel sharp?
- Yes.

25:53.906 --> 25:55.483
- What's her crit?
- Working on it.

25:55.657 --> 25:57.566
- How about here?
- Yes.

25:57.743 --> 25:59.984
- Do you have voice mail or machine?
- Machine.

26:00.161 --> 26:02.285
- Would she hear you leaving a message?
- I don't know.

26:02.456 --> 26:04.828
- How about here?
- No.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.793
Were you already home
or was he waiting for you?

26:07.961 --> 26:11.544
He came in. I was sitting
at my desk doing my bills.

26:11.715 --> 26:13.708
Patellar reflexes are absent.

26:13.884 --> 26:16.340
Dr. Greene, no one's answering the door.
Do you want them to search the house?

26:16.596 --> 26:18.090
- Yeah.
- They'd have to force entry.

26:18.264 --> 26:21.264
- Search the house!
-942, go ahead.

26:21.433 --> 26:23.225
- Still hypotensive.
- Up her to 10 mics.

26:23.394 --> 26:25.102
- She needs volume.
- I'm not in yet.

26:31.819 --> 26:34.524
Adele, can you bend your knee?

26:34.697 --> 26:36.524
- I can't move it.
- Look, I don't care.

26:36.699 --> 26:39.653
We may have an emergency
laminectomy. Fine. Check. Go.

26:39.827 --> 26:42.449
Doc, they'll call it in
when they have it secured.

26:43.415 --> 26:47.164
- Am I paralyzed?
- Hopefully, it's only temporary.

26:47.836 --> 26:50.505
- That's it. Give me a new kit.
- Check for sacral sparing.

26:50.672 --> 26:52.047
Come on, now. Now.

26:52.215 --> 26:54.457
Set up the microscope.
We're coming up.

26:54.634 --> 26:56.045
Maybe she went out,
went to the store.

26:56.219 --> 26:57.382
- Did you page her?
- What?

26:57.554 --> 26:58.882
- Did you page her?
- No.

26:59.055 --> 27:01.381
I need you to page Dr. Corday.

27:01.558 --> 27:03.385
I don't-
I know that! Page her!

27:20.202 --> 27:22.775
Mr. Jeffries. Mr. Jeffries.

27:22.955 --> 27:24.747
- What's his HemoCue?
- Down to five.

27:24.916 --> 27:27.916
- Barely responds to painful stimuli.
- Hang two units of blood.

27:28.085 --> 27:30.790
- He doesn't want that.
- Where's the consent form?

27:30.963 --> 27:33.086
- On the cart.
- You can't take him without consent.

27:33.257 --> 27:35.000
He's unable to give consent now.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.749
I need two physicians' signatures
for emergency surgery.

27:37.928 --> 27:39.008
No.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.054
- You'd have him die?
- I'll respect his wishes.

27:58.950 --> 28:01.785
Good, Adele. The spinal injury
is incomplete. We can operate.

28:01.953 --> 28:04.076
- I need an emergency signature.
- Not now.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.952
IJ's in. Let's get another chest.

28:07.125 --> 28:09.747
- He's bleeding out.
- Run the Solu-Medrol. 325 an hour.

28:09.919 --> 28:13.869
- Gunshot wound to the belly-
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Whatever. Go.

28:14.049 --> 28:15.841
Systolic's up to 100.

28:16.969 --> 28:20.752
All right. Let's get him up.
Can you get a repeat CBC?

28:20.932 --> 28:23.553
- Whatever you want, Peter.
- I've got my two signatures.

28:23.726 --> 28:25.101
He made himself clear.

28:25.269 --> 28:28.602
Look, he has advanced AIDS.
He probably has an HIV encephalopathy.

28:28.772 --> 28:31.727
No. He was alert and oriented.

28:31.901 --> 28:34.736
- You should have called Psych.
- I did. They never showed up.

28:34.904 --> 28:37.312
- Laura called. They're still-
- Damn it!

28:37.490 --> 28:40.277
- Oh, God! I'm sorry.
- Hold on. Did you cut yourself?

28:40.451 --> 28:43.203
I don't think so.
The glove just tore there.

28:43.370 --> 28:44.699
- Peter.
- Hold on. Hold on.

28:44.872 --> 28:46.664
Let me get some gauze pads.
Come on.

28:59.054 --> 29:00.512
Let me see it, all right?

29:07.020 --> 29:08.431
- Oh, God.
- Keep irrigating it.

29:08.605 --> 29:10.645
- Where are the Zerowets?
- Bottom left drawer.

29:10.816 --> 29:14.600
Pharmacy? This is Dr. Benton.
I need you to pull a PEP kit for me.

29:14.778 --> 29:16.687
All right. Use two liters.

29:16.863 --> 29:19.401
What? No. Look, I'm on my way
up there right now.

29:19.574 --> 29:22.659
- What about the patient?
- Keep transfusing him.

29:27.959 --> 29:30.116
- Talk to Neuro?
- They're doing a craniotomy.

29:30.294 --> 29:31.373
Watch it, Peter.

29:31.545 --> 29:33.289
I need help with
a thoracic decompression.

29:33.464 --> 29:38.042
There's a piece of bone in your
mid-back, pressing on your spinal cord.

29:38.218 --> 29:39.796
That's why I can't move my legs?

29:39.971 --> 29:42.544
Yes. But if they remove the fragment,
you may recover.

29:42.724 --> 29:44.716
No one's at your house.
We did a sweep.

29:44.892 --> 29:46.434
- Check my garage?
- Yeah. Nothing.

29:46.603 --> 29:48.725
- Call me if you find her.
- Will I be paralyzed?

29:48.896 --> 29:51.185
- Not if I can help it.
- I still need to talk to you.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.472
Drop it. It's over.

29:52.650 --> 29:54.144
- Is my van still there?
- What?

29:54.318 --> 29:56.560
- The garage. Was my van there?
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:56.738 --> 29:58.861
- But you have two cars.
- Hers is in the shop.

29:59.032 --> 30:02.982
- Does she take the baby out?
- She's been going for walks around 3.

30:03.244 --> 30:05.534
- It's 1:05.
- It depends on the baby's schedule.

30:05.705 --> 30:07.948
Can you keep a unit there
until she gets home?

30:08.125 --> 30:09.323
- Nick.
- Yeah.

30:09.501 --> 30:11.908
- Nick, listen.
- Shot in the head from the back.

30:12.087 --> 30:15.088
- The guy was riding in the back seat.
- Cab driver on Roosevelt.

30:15.257 --> 30:17.083
Roger that, 27. Rescue's en route.

30:17.258 --> 30:20.260
Okay, that'll be us. Can you
give it to Luka? I have to go upstairs.

30:20.429 --> 30:22.636
- Think it's him?
- Yeah, that's him.

30:23.182 --> 30:24.925
I can't reach this boy's father.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.559
- And he's figuring it out.
- Who?

30:26.727 --> 30:29.182
The neck wound. His mother died.
You need to talk to him.

30:29.355 --> 30:30.979
I'll be right there.

30:31.190 --> 30:35.768
Carter, we got a GSW to the head
coming in. I want you to prep Trauma 1.

30:35.944 --> 30:39.479
- Get Dilantin, mannitol and Decadron.
- ETA?

30:39.657 --> 30:42.278
- Check with dispatch.
- Ewing seems pretty aggressive.

30:42.451 --> 30:45.406
We'll need a chest and abdominal CT
to rule out metastatic disease.

30:45.580 --> 30:48.948
- You sure? It's a soft-tissue mass.
- Extra-osseous. It's rare.

30:49.125 --> 30:51.331
You might want to write it up.

30:51.502 --> 30:53.210
- Thank you.
- Want me to talk to the parents?

30:53.379 --> 30:55.621
He doesn't have any parents.

30:57.383 --> 31:01.428
Where is she? Where is my mom?
Where is this operation?

31:04.558 --> 31:07.227
The bullet...

31:08.853 --> 31:11.309
She was shot in the back.

31:11.481 --> 31:13.854
The bullet passed through her heart.

31:14.442 --> 31:18.939
She lost so much blood
that her heart stopped beating.

31:20.407 --> 31:24.191
We opened up her chest
for an emergency surgery.

31:25.495 --> 31:27.821
We gave her blood transfusions.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.829
The best surgeon in the hospital did it.

31:39.468 --> 31:42.635
She wasn't in any pain.
She didn't suffer.

31:43.806 --> 31:47.341
We worked on her for a long time.

31:50.729 --> 31:53.933
We couldn't stop the bleeding.

31:54.108 --> 31:56.860
And we couldn't get her heart
to beat again.

31:59.906 --> 32:03.110
Ted, your mother died.

32:05.161 --> 32:07.238
I'm sorry.

32:15.004 --> 32:17.293
Here. You need to take these now.

32:17.465 --> 32:21.000
- Shouldn't we draw baseline labs first?
- No. Now. The sooner the better.

32:21.178 --> 32:23.669
Peter, two units are in.
I can't get his pressure above 80.

32:23.847 --> 32:26.173
- All right. Hold on.
- He's already drug-resistant.

32:26.350 --> 32:28.141
- You don't have a large viral load.
- He does.

32:28.310 --> 32:32.688
Cleo, listen to me. The conversion rate
with meds is less than 3 in 1000.

32:32.857 --> 32:35.727
Peter. Crit is 14.
If he's going, he has to go now.

32:36.736 --> 32:38.443
Okay?

32:38.612 --> 32:41.648
All right. Get another two units.
I'll meet you at the elevator.

32:41.823 --> 32:45.905
Call Infectious Disease. See if they need
to modify the post-exposure regimen.

33:10.603 --> 33:12.097
I'm surprised my code still works.

33:12.271 --> 33:15.225
- It's not gonna happen, Kim.
- What isn't?

33:15.400 --> 33:20.394
- They can't let you go, not legally.
- No. They always intended to fire me.

33:20.571 --> 33:24.404
They would have done it sooner, but they
needed a thick Human Resource file first.

33:24.576 --> 33:26.901
Which is bogus.
They'll never get away with it.

33:27.078 --> 33:29.570
- They already have.
- Only if you let them.

33:29.748 --> 33:30.946
It's not worth the effort.

33:31.124 --> 33:33.829
I'm not interested in working
for a place that doesn't want me.

33:34.002 --> 33:37.667
You have the right to due process.
We can find a civil-rights attorney.

33:37.839 --> 33:38.954
We?

33:44.138 --> 33:45.418
It's not right, Kim.

33:45.597 --> 33:48.219
You know why they're firing you.

33:48.392 --> 33:51.761
You have to fight it.
You have to fight this.

33:52.354 --> 33:54.097
I'm supposed to fight?

33:54.274 --> 33:56.943
You're hiding
but I'm supposed to fight.

33:57.110 --> 33:59.945
Well, I'm sorry.
But I don't want to fight.

34:00.113 --> 34:03.398
I just want to move on.
So should you.

34:07.912 --> 34:11.281
Chris and Hillary. It's Mark Greene.
I'm looking for Elizabeth.

34:11.456 --> 34:13.616
If you see her, could you ask her
to give me a call?

34:13.793 --> 34:15.417
- Thanks.
- Dr. Greene, we got him.

34:15.587 --> 34:16.998
He opened fire in Lincoln Park.

34:17.172 --> 34:20.089
Shot three people before being
taken down by a civilian packing a 9mm.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.880
- Is he still alive?
- So far.

34:23.178 --> 34:25.254
- What's he had?
- Two amps of epi and atropine.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.637
Is this the cabby?

34:27.808 --> 34:29.005
Shot at the base of his skull.

34:29.184 --> 34:32.553
- Cleo, jump in on this?
- High cervical injury. Blew out his brains.

34:32.728 --> 34:35.481
- Cleo!
- Any vitals in the field?

34:35.649 --> 34:37.772
- No. Just lots of brain matter.
- Any witnesses?

34:37.943 --> 34:39.936
- No. But we think it was Fossen.
- Well, why?

34:40.112 --> 34:43.232
1211 Dupont was the last entry
on the driver's log at 1: 14 p. m.

34:43.407 --> 34:45.199
- What?
- The house you had searched.

34:45.367 --> 34:46.992
Fossen must have been
on his way over there.

34:47.161 --> 34:49.319
Cabby probably heard
his description on the radio.

34:49.496 --> 34:52.248
- Dr. Greene?
- Bang. Fossen blew his brains out.

34:52.416 --> 34:53.827
- Dr. Greene?
- Don't worry, doc.

34:54.001 --> 34:56.539
- That means he never got there.
- Dr. Greene!

34:56.712 --> 34:59.038
He's coming in.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.636
Was that a record number
of gunshot wounds for one shift?

35:07.515 --> 35:09.840
By the same guy? Absolutely.

35:11.519 --> 35:15.137
He has a good chance.
Like you said, you found it early.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.355
It's more that he has
to go through it alone, you know?

35:17.525 --> 35:19.851
As if having cancer as a kid
wasn't bad enough.

35:20.028 --> 35:22.186
He could get passed over
for Chief Resident.

35:22.363 --> 35:26.576
Or he could get kicked out of med school
and be forced to work as an ER nurse.

35:26.743 --> 35:29.031
- I was not kicked out.
- What would you call it?

35:29.204 --> 35:32.158
Suspended for being a deadbeat.

35:34.668 --> 35:36.956
Do you know he offered
to pay my tuition?

35:37.128 --> 35:39.038
- Who?
- Luka.

35:40.632 --> 35:44.416
And I know he means well.
It's just frustrating for me sometimes...

35:44.595 --> 35:46.718
...because I have to explain
my every feeling.

35:46.889 --> 35:51.385
And normally when you're with someone
for a while, they learn your moods.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.133
- But he doesn't do that.
- You know what?

35:55.731 --> 35:58.482
- Stop it.
- What?

36:00.361 --> 36:02.602
Don't talk to me about Luka.

36:04.157 --> 36:06.030
I'm not your girlfriend.

36:06.659 --> 36:10.158
- And I shouldn't even be here with you.
- Why not?

36:13.750 --> 36:17.118
Because I don't want to wish
bad things for you and Luka.

36:17.294 --> 36:21.589
And I don't want to sit on the sidelines
waiting for you two to break up.

36:24.010 --> 36:26.216
And I don't want to be your friend.

36:27.639 --> 36:31.174
It might be convenient for you,
but it's not doing much for me.

36:31.351 --> 36:33.759
What are you talking about?

36:55.251 --> 36:57.707
Where did you put him?
Where did you put my son?

36:57.878 --> 36:59.538
- How much O-neg do you want?
- Four units.

36:59.713 --> 37:02.465
- You can't take me from him!
- Quiet! So we can listen!

37:02.633 --> 37:04.673
- Two entrance wounds on the right.
- One on the left.

37:04.844 --> 37:06.800
Another two in the belly.
A total of five.

37:06.971 --> 37:09.094
You. You did this.

37:09.265 --> 37:12.100
Set up for bilateral chest tubes
and a central line.

37:12.268 --> 37:14.142
- Systolic's low at 80.
- I'll intubate.

37:14.312 --> 37:16.269
- This is your fault!
- Ready for the chest tubes.

37:16.439 --> 37:20.519
Now. Paralyze.
One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.

37:20.693 --> 37:23.647
You stole my son.
You destroyed my family.

37:23.821 --> 37:25.197
Ambu-bag.

37:25.657 --> 37:29.606
He's my son!
What gives you the right to...?

37:31.621 --> 37:33.080
You can't take my son away!

37:33.498 --> 37:36.950
It starts with one bad cell that multiplies.
And then it grows out of control.

37:37.127 --> 37:41.789
You usually don't know it's there until
it is big enough that it causes pain.

37:41.965 --> 37:44.373
We're very lucky
that we found it today.

37:44.551 --> 37:46.958
So you're saying I'm lucky I got shot.

37:47.138 --> 37:48.596
In a way, yeah.

37:48.764 --> 37:51.005
It's just gonna take longer to die.

37:51.183 --> 37:52.926
No. That's what I'm telling you.

37:53.102 --> 37:55.853
Since we caught it early, there's
a good chance that you're not gonna die.

37:56.021 --> 37:58.144
What's a good chance?

37:58.315 --> 38:00.189
Seventy percent.

38:00.651 --> 38:04.102
- You know what 70 percent is?
- Yeah. It leaves 30.

38:04.279 --> 38:07.066
Well, let's concentrate on
the 70, okay?

38:07.241 --> 38:10.989
- Dr. Carter, GSW's rolling in.
- Okay. Be right there.

38:12.580 --> 38:13.825
So, what happens to me now?

38:13.998 --> 38:17.913
Now I'm gonna have a cancer doctor, an
oncologist, come and take a look at you.

38:18.086 --> 38:20.493
No. I mean, where do I live?

38:22.382 --> 38:24.374
I don't know. I'll find out.

38:30.307 --> 38:32.263
When was your last tetanus booster?

38:32.433 --> 38:34.759
I don't know. Do I need an x-ray?

38:34.936 --> 38:37.225
- It looks like just a graze.
- Is that the guy?

38:37.397 --> 38:40.731
Yes. Multiple GSWs to the chest
and abdomen.

38:40.901 --> 38:43.570
At the range, they teach you to shoot
for the center mass.

38:43.737 --> 38:46.358
It's not always fatal
but it takes him down.

38:46.531 --> 38:49.817
- You shot him?
- I got mugged last year.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.994
Same park. I don't go there now
without protection.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.662
He started shooting people!
Someone had to do something!

38:56.834 --> 38:58.162
We should arm the whole city.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.087
Hey, I stopped him.
He would have kept going.

39:01.255 --> 39:03.627
- You're lucky.
- Lucky I was packing.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.922
- Carter, you free?
- Sort of.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.753
GSW to the right flank.

39:07.928 --> 39:10.882
Vitals are stable, but I need you
to check for gross hematuria.

39:11.056 --> 39:12.966
Okay. I'll be right there.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.222
- I handed it in to her.
- What?

39:14.394 --> 39:16.551
Your reference. Should put you
over the top. All fives.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.188
- Wow! Thanks.
- I had to lie.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.265
- Now, Carter.
- Coming.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.265
First two are in.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.528
Another subclavian.
Put the next two on the infuser.

39:25.696 --> 39:29.113
- How's the chest tube output?
- Couple hundred cc's.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.284
- Only 50 on my side.
- Is he gonna make it?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.446
Probably.
Didn't hit any vital structures.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.374
- After five shots?
- Some guys get lucky.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.662
19 shot. Eight, maybe nine dead.
He's lucky we didn't take him down.

39:40.838 --> 39:44.502
- Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday's on line four.
- Could you get it for me?

39:44.674 --> 39:48.008
- Pressure's up to 85.
-3-0 nylon. What's in the Foley?

39:48.178 --> 39:52.555
Seventy cc's.
Dips are negative for heme.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.476
Can you cut this? Elizabeth?

39:55.644 --> 39:57.969
- Mark, what's going on?
- Where were you?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.309
I was at the Farmer's Market.

39:59.481 --> 40:02.767
There were police in the house
and the front door's been kicked in.

40:02.943 --> 40:04.437
- I told them to.
- Why?

40:04.611 --> 40:06.604
Long story. Vaseline gauze.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.231
You're not gonna tell me
what happened?

40:10.409 --> 40:12.734
Nothing. It's just a bit of a scare.

40:12.911 --> 40:17.289
- You' re all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Call you later?

40:18.584 --> 40:22.249
- I told the police to stay until I called you.
- Yeah. Yeah, he can go now.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.790
You' re not gonna tell me
what's going on?

40:25.466 --> 40:28.218
Not right now. Everything's okay.

40:28.386 --> 40:30.046
Okay, then.

40:30.930 --> 40:34.346
- Will you be off at 7?
- Yes. I will be there.

40:34.851 --> 40:36.310
Okay.

40:37.104 --> 40:39.641
- I love you.
- Me too.

40:42.442 --> 40:44.269
Elastoplast.

40:46.404 --> 40:47.947
Get ready for a portable chest.

40:48.115 --> 40:51.613
Keep the dopamine at 10 mics. Neuro
checks, 30 minutes. A CBC in an hour.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.824
- Any cord contusion?
- No, extrinsic hematoma.

40:53.995 --> 40:55.738
- Did they find Elizabeth?
- She's fine.

40:55.915 --> 40:58.120
- Good.
- What about her paralysis?

40:58.291 --> 41:02.669
- Ask me in 24 hours. What's this?
- GSW to the renal parenchyma.

41:02.838 --> 41:05.294
Marge, clear OR 2.
We got another customer.

41:05.466 --> 41:06.925
I'll be right back.

41:07.092 --> 41:10.378
- Robert, I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, sure. Anything but Legaspi.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.298
You're making a mistake.

41:12.473 --> 41:16.174
My main mistake was not firing her
three months ago when I first found out.

41:16.352 --> 41:17.976
- What?
- That she is incompetent.

41:18.145 --> 41:20.636
- That's not what you were gonna say.
- Really?

41:20.814 --> 41:23.566
In addition to your diagnostic skills,
you're a mind reader.

41:23.734 --> 41:26.570
- It's because she's gay.
- Of course I'm not.

41:26.738 --> 41:28.695
That would be politically incorrect.

41:28.864 --> 41:30.442
She's a pain in the ass.

41:30.617 --> 41:32.739
Like Maggie Doyle was?

41:33.244 --> 41:36.494
- Let's stop right there.
- And avoid your history of discrimination?

41:36.664 --> 41:39.998
If you don't rethink this, there's a good
chance you'll be out of a job.

41:40.168 --> 41:42.873
Dr. Legaspi has demonstrated
not only poor judgment...

41:43.046 --> 41:46.795
...but a reckless attitude towards patients
and a blatant disregard for authority.

41:46.967 --> 41:50.418
She's out. She's fired.
End of discussion.

41:53.097 --> 41:54.343
- If she goes, I go.
- What?

41:54.516 --> 41:55.974
You heard me.

41:56.935 --> 41:59.307
- Are you giving me an ultimatum?
- I swear to God.

41:59.479 --> 42:02.682
- I will walk out if you don't back off.
- I do not respond well to ultimatums!

42:02.858 --> 42:05.729
You had better choose your battles
very carefully!

42:05.903 --> 42:08.773
You're the Chief of Emergency Medicine,
not the county's lesbian advocate.

42:08.947 --> 42:10.857
That's where you're wrong.
Because I am both.

42:11.033 --> 42:13.820
I am the Chief of Emergency Medicine,
and I am a lesbian.

42:13.994 --> 42:18.407
If you pursue this matter, I will take it
to the County Board of Supervisors...

42:18.582 --> 42:21.619
...the ACLU, the press,
and anyone else who will listen!

42:21.794 --> 42:25.922
So I suggest you choose
your battles very carefully!

42:44.651 --> 42:47.984
- BP's 100/60.
- Going in the right direction.

42:48.154 --> 42:50.443
- Last HemoCue?
-9.5.

42:50.615 --> 42:52.525
You want me to bring him up?

42:53.451 --> 42:54.994
- Mark?
- What?

42:55.162 --> 42:57.735
- You want me to bring him up?
- No, no. I got it.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.162
They are sending cross-matched
blood to the OR.

43:00.334 --> 43:01.364
Good.

43:01.543 --> 43:03.868
Could you bring the chart back down
so I can write my note?

43:04.045 --> 43:05.706
Sure.

43:06.465 --> 43:08.588
He's gonna need some more Pavulon.

43:10.302 --> 43:13.834
Damn it! I forgot the drug box.
Be right back.
