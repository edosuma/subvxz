WEBVTT

02:44.848 --> 02:49.603
After a series of fantastic adventures

02:49.854 --> 02:53.529
in which Sir Lancelot played a heroic part,

02:53.734 --> 02:58.012
King Arthur's knights, also known as
the "Knights of the Round Table",

02:58.239 --> 03:00.070
set off in search of the Grail.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.670
The Grail was a holy relic,
a cup from the Last Supper

03:03.871 --> 03:08.103
in which Joseph of Arimathea collected
Christ's blood from his body on the cross.

03:08.335 --> 03:10.405
It was said to bestow supernatural powers

03:10.546 --> 03:13.379
and believed to be hidden
somewhere in Brittany.

03:13.550 --> 03:18.465
Before he died, the wizard Merlin
pledged the knights to this holy quest.

03:18.723 --> 03:21.521
Merlin had indicated
that the quest should be led

03:21.684 --> 03:24.994
not by Sir Lancelot,
the world's premier knight,

03:25.189 --> 03:28.977
but by a young knight called Perceval
or Parsifal, the "Pure of Heart".

03:29.194 --> 03:32.664
As soon as they left the castle
the knights dispersed.

03:32.865 --> 03:35.459
Perceval disappeared
and was never seen again.

03:35.618 --> 03:37.609
Two years have passed.

03:37.746 --> 03:41.534
Decimated, the knights return
to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

03:41.751 --> 03:44.549
They have not found the Grail.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.612
He whose footsteps precede him
will die within a year.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.372
- Even if they're his horse's steps?
- Even if they're his horse's steps.

04:14.581 --> 04:17.300
You said the same thing
the day before yesterday.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.054
Because it is the same omen for everyone.

04:27.305 --> 04:29.455
I've lost my way.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.319
This is Escalot.
I'll show you the way.

04:57.468 --> 05:01.586
Lancelot of the Lake

07:03.579 --> 07:05.092
Is that you, Lancelot?

07:06.123 --> 07:07.238
Is that you, Gawain?

07:07.333 --> 07:10.530
You were ahead and yet
you come in last with the injured.

07:10.712 --> 07:12.589
I was lost near Escalot.

07:12.715 --> 07:14.706
Greetings, Lionel.

07:14.842 --> 07:16.833
Greetings, Lambegus, Bohort.

08:09.567 --> 08:11.523
- Uncle, it's Lancelot.
- Lancelot.

08:14.574 --> 08:16.451
Sire, I do not bring you the Grail.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.168
I come empty-handed.

08:21.874 --> 08:23.273
The Grail eludes us.

08:23.376 --> 08:25.731
There was only blood and death.

08:25.879 --> 08:28.268
At least you were spared, Lancelot.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.734
Inform the Queen.
I want her to know her knight has returned.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.917
I'm on my way.

09:00.796 --> 09:01.831
Mass already?

09:01.923 --> 09:03.914
It hasn't chimed three yet.

10:06.326 --> 10:07.315
Lancelot.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.119
Guinevere.

10:24.389 --> 10:25.981
You are alive and you are here.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.448
Nothing shall ever take you
away from me again.

10:33.859 --> 10:36.248
All is lost for us here in Brittany.

10:55.844 --> 10:57.641
I can wait no longer.

10:57.763 --> 10:58.957
Say it.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.252
I love you.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.677
Again. Say it once more.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.896
I love you. You must believe me.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.430
I believe you.

11:12.698 --> 11:16.008
But what is the matter?
Give me your hand.

11:22.251 --> 11:24.003
The one you are hiding from me.

11:28.509 --> 11:29.908
Your finger is bare.

11:31.179 --> 11:32.851
You have taken off my ring.

11:40.899 --> 11:42.617
Speak. You are frightening me.

11:44.612 --> 11:45.886
I saw the Grail.

11:46.781 --> 11:48.009
The Grail?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.415
One night I sought refuge
in a ruined chapel.

11:52.789 --> 11:57.260
A voice challenged me,
accusing me of deceit and treachery.

11:57.503 --> 11:59.698
I can still hear that voice
ringing in my ears.

11:59.839 --> 12:00.828
You dreamt it.

12:02.258 --> 12:04.897
I can no longer be your lover, Guinevere.

12:05.054 --> 12:07.249
I swore to God with my sword drawn.

12:07.390 --> 12:08.903
You did that?

12:09.017 --> 12:10.769
I did.

12:11.812 --> 12:15.282
For God to hear you,
you must be absolved of another vow.

12:17.402 --> 12:20.155
I ask you to absolve me of that vow,
Guinevere.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.742
I gave myself wholly to you,

12:22.867 --> 12:24.664
and you took me.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.039
I shall have this room closed.

13:50.165 --> 13:53.635
Why, Uncle?
Will you never assemble us again?

13:55.004 --> 13:56.835
Assemble who?

13:56.965 --> 13:58.523
Here sat Ydier.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.988
Here Clamadeu and Urien.

14:02.012 --> 14:05.482
Here Galeschin and all the others.
Here, here and here.

14:05.684 --> 14:07.276
We shall never see them again.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.296
Here Perceval.

14:13.693 --> 14:15.046
There Claudas.

14:15.153 --> 14:17.906
And there, there and there.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.712
No, no.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.817
Too many dead
and too many memories.

14:29.713 --> 14:32.750
Come in, Mordred.
I want to ask you the question too.

14:32.925 --> 14:34.404
What are we going to do now?

14:36.262 --> 14:39.652
I warned you, Sire, against
rushing into such a foolish venture.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.966
But you did not rush into it, Mordred.

14:42.103 --> 14:43.934
You stayed behind in safety.

14:44.064 --> 14:46.862
I will refrain from drawing
conclusions from this disaster.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.017
That's not what you were asked.

14:49.153 --> 14:50.745
Sire, I'd rather keep silent.

14:50.864 --> 14:53.378
In that case, Mordred, you may go.

15:02.962 --> 15:06.352
- I am troubled, my friends.
- Troubled, Sire?

15:06.549 --> 15:08.141
Have we provoked God?

15:09.428 --> 15:11.783
Are these terrible deaths a punishment,

15:11.931 --> 15:13.649
a decree of his justice?

15:13.766 --> 15:17.281
Is this silent, empty castle not a sign
that God has turned away from us,

15:17.479 --> 15:18.958
that God has forsaken us?

15:19.064 --> 15:20.782
Let us reform our ranks, Uncle.

15:20.900 --> 15:26.338
Later. I lack the heart when we have lost
so many noble companions

15:26.615 --> 15:28.526
to replace them at a moment's notice.

15:28.659 --> 15:29.648
We must wait.

15:29.744 --> 15:32.258
With folded arms?
Wait for what?

15:32.414 --> 15:34.484
We have received a terrible blow.

15:37.086 --> 15:39.361
May God guide us
as to what to do next.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.781
And what if he does not?

15:43.135 --> 15:44.727
I want you to remain at arms.

15:47.891 --> 15:51.566
Practise, improve yourselves.
Above all, remain united.

15:51.771 --> 15:55.161
Forget your quarrels,
do everything to cultivate friendship.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.564
What does Arthur say?

16:16.718 --> 16:18.834
He says that the air we breathe is poisoned

16:18.971 --> 16:21.246
but that you will turn the poison into balm.

16:22.391 --> 16:23.540
Why me?

16:25.061 --> 16:26.938
He always calls on you for help.

16:27.064 --> 16:28.782
He expects a miracle from you.

16:29.650 --> 16:32.403
I've been turning his words over
in my head all day.

16:32.570 --> 16:33.889
Which words?

16:33.989 --> 16:35.217
All of them.

16:35.324 --> 16:36.598
"Improve yourselves."

16:38.161 --> 16:39.753
You have devoted your life to that.

16:39.871 --> 16:42.749
How else would you be
so masterful in combat?

16:42.916 --> 16:47.194
I must improve myself in other ways,
but let's talk about Mordred.

16:47.422 --> 16:50.858
Mordred will not come to us.
We must go to him.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.963
He represents everything
that you and I despise.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.936
The day he splashed you crossing the river

16:57.100 --> 16:59.773
you accused him of being rude to your horse.

16:59.937 --> 17:02.371
He trembled with fear before you.

17:02.524 --> 17:03.923
I do not like weaklings.

17:07.613 --> 17:09.604
They should be hanged.

17:15.206 --> 17:16.685
The Queen's room is lit.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.588
What of it?

17:18.710 --> 17:21.178
I wonder, while they all feign sleep,

17:21.338 --> 17:24.216
how many pairs of wide-open eyes
are trained on that window.

17:24.383 --> 17:25.418
That is idle talk.

17:25.510 --> 17:28.786
It is not idle talk.
I have seen Agravain, Guivret, Lucan.

17:28.972 --> 17:31.361
Even Mordred dares.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.508
Think no more of it and go to bed.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.920
His name will appear in the calendar.

17:56.072 --> 17:58.108
Lancelot has become a saint.

17:58.241 --> 18:02.951
I suppose we shall have to wait a long time
to see you to become a saint, Gawain.

18:03.206 --> 18:05.515
I go to Mass, I take Communion.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.704
That is all God asks of me.
He wanted me to be this way.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.598
He wanted you
to love the life he gave you.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.273
I should love it more
if everyone around me looked less dejected.

18:29.071 --> 18:30.060
Uncle.

18:31.866 --> 18:35.336
You must do something.
Give us a purpose.

18:36.329 --> 18:38.923
I gave you a purpose.
Pray, Gawain.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.482
You must pray.

18:45.716 --> 18:46.705
Pray.

18:56.229 --> 18:57.787
Consent.

18:57.897 --> 18:59.774
Free me from my vow.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.494
You have changed, Lancelot,
but I am the same.

19:04.614 --> 19:06.252
Say yes.

19:06.366 --> 19:09.119
I beg you, for all our sakes.

19:10.329 --> 19:13.366
No. I will not save anyone at that price.

19:13.541 --> 19:15.691
God does not ask us to forswear love.

19:15.836 --> 19:18.509
That which was must be no more.

19:18.673 --> 19:20.664
Can we make what was be no more?

19:21.634 --> 19:24.910
We can ward off ill fortune,
deflect the threat.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.692
There is no threat.
It only exists in your sick imagination.

19:29.811 --> 19:31.449
Yield, Guinevere.

19:31.563 --> 19:32.837
I yield.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.817
I humble myself.

19:34.942 --> 19:38.139
Thinking you are responsible for everything
is not humility.

19:46.248 --> 19:47.840
So you are the enemy.

19:48.626 --> 19:51.345
I was made to help you.

19:51.504 --> 19:54.814
I will go with you
through the emptiness and the darkness.

19:56.969 --> 19:58.800
I am your strength.

20:00.014 --> 20:03.006
You said, "Without Guinevere,
there would be no Lancelot."

20:07.899 --> 20:08.934
I wish to be alone.

20:11.528 --> 20:14.281
You are alone in your pride.

20:14.449 --> 20:17.168
Pride in what is not yours is a falsehood.

20:17.327 --> 20:19.363
It was down to me
to bring back the Grail.

20:19.496 --> 20:23.171
It was not the Grail that you wanted,
it was God.

20:24.419 --> 20:26.489
God is not a trophy
you can bring home.

20:29.425 --> 20:33.304
You were unrelenting.
You killed, pillaged, burned.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.599
Then you turned on each other
like maniacs, blindly.

20:40.564 --> 20:43.032
And now you blame our love
for this disaster.

20:52.328 --> 20:57.118
And I am to destroy in an instant this love
which it cost us so much to preserve?

20:57.376 --> 20:58.934
I refuse, I will not.

20:59.045 --> 21:01.001
It is not what you want that matters.

21:02.549 --> 21:03.698
I cannot.

21:04.802 --> 21:07.077
Nor is it this happiness that you seek.

21:07.221 --> 21:10.497
Is this what happiness is?
That which consumes my soul?

21:13.020 --> 21:15.375
Who am I
that I do not throw myself at your feet?

21:15.523 --> 21:17.639
I do not ask to love you.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.893
Is it my fault
that I cannot live without you,

21:21.030 --> 21:23.225
that I need you?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.942
I do not live for Arthur.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.208
Simply say to me,
"For you, I choose death over life."

21:33.002 --> 21:36.472
Say it, then I shall consent
and everything will be simple.

21:38.175 --> 21:39.574
That is impossible.

21:40.553 --> 21:43.590
Happy the woman who knows
why she must sacrifice herself.

21:43.766 --> 21:45.199
But you know, Guinevere.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.981
It's not possible for God to separate us.

21:50.148 --> 21:52.025
If I surrender, it will be to you.

21:52.151 --> 21:53.470
You alone.

21:57.365 --> 21:58.764
Do you not want that?

22:08.504 --> 22:10.062
What do you want me to say?

22:11.257 --> 22:13.771
Only the "yes"
that I see already on your lips.

22:15.679 --> 22:17.829
Since you see it, it must be there.

22:17.974 --> 22:19.771
You can do with me as you wish.

23:07.525 --> 23:10.642
- What are you looking up at?
- The moon.

23:10.821 --> 23:14.530
Carmaduc says that little cloud
is engulfing the moon, drowning it.

23:14.743 --> 23:16.654
I say it is strangling it, choking it.

23:17.538 --> 23:19.096
Meaning?

23:19.999 --> 23:22.832
That we will all end up suffocating
if we do not strike free.

23:26.131 --> 23:28.326
Look. The cloud is retreating.

23:45.689 --> 23:47.088
Is it your watch?

23:49.151 --> 23:52.063
It is time for your rounds.
Let me go with you.

23:52.239 --> 23:54.434
That will not be necessary.
I prefer to go alone.

23:54.575 --> 23:56.327
Mordred, let us make peace.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.326
Did Arthur send you to speak to me?

23:59.456 --> 24:00.935
I came of my own accord.

24:02.501 --> 24:06.574
I am deeply honoured
but I think things are best left as they are.

24:06.798 --> 24:08.550
What do you want?

24:08.675 --> 24:11.269
Your friendship in exchange for mine.

24:11.429 --> 24:13.624
We both serve the same king.

24:14.891 --> 24:17.246
He takes your advice.
He does not take mine.

24:17.394 --> 24:19.385
We are equal.

24:19.522 --> 24:22.958
Our table was made round
so there would be no precedence.

24:26.447 --> 24:27.641
A woman's scarf?

24:28.407 --> 24:29.806
Do you recognise it?

24:33.288 --> 24:35.085
No, not if you hide it.

24:40.464 --> 24:42.375
Mordred,

24:42.508 --> 24:45.102
if I give you my right hand,
will you refuse it?

25:16.967 --> 25:19.037
What insolence.

25:19.178 --> 25:20.372
How dare he?

25:24.768 --> 25:28.647
For much lesser affronts, you have drawn
your sword and struck at the heart.

25:28.856 --> 25:31.654
I went to him unarmed.

25:33.361 --> 25:35.556
You could have struck him with your fists.

25:35.698 --> 25:37.928
No, self-control is a strength.

25:38.076 --> 25:39.589
Easily mistaken as a weakness.

25:39.702 --> 25:43.092
He will say you are scared,
that you backed down as though guilty.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.732
Guilty of what?

25:47.003 --> 25:51.235
I do not know. What I do know is
that they are all going over to his side.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.820
Who?

25:52.927 --> 25:56.556
My brother Agravain,
Lucan, Urien, and others.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.278
You are perplexing us.

26:04.399 --> 26:07.630
Here, take this bridle and this bit.

26:08.905 --> 26:10.543
You told me you liked those best.

26:10.657 --> 26:12.454
That is why I am giving them to you.

26:41.820 --> 26:44.129
Lord God, do not forsake us.

26:45.074 --> 26:46.473
Do not forsake me.

26:47.452 --> 26:51.331
I struggle constantly
against a death worse than death.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.577
Deliver me from a temptation
I can scarcely resist.

27:13.525 --> 27:15.402
They wear their swords on the right.

27:15.527 --> 27:17.518
They are from Gallesfort or Escalot.

27:23.829 --> 27:24.818
From Escalot.

27:38.555 --> 27:41.752
- Why have they come here?
- To see if we are still breathing.

28:08.216 --> 28:10.446
Was I right? Was I wrong?

28:10.594 --> 28:15.349
Had you refused, word would have gone round
that we are weak and cowardly.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.957
A tournament is not war
and we know in advance who will be the victor.

28:20.189 --> 28:23.147
- My trusty Lancelot.
- Your trusty Lancelot, Sire.

28:23.318 --> 28:25.115
We have a fortnight to prepare.

29:07.288 --> 29:10.086
It is only a Whitsun tournament.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.889
Do we need an angel to descend

29:13.045 --> 29:15.001
or tongues of fire to lick our heads?

29:15.131 --> 29:18.009
Look how alert and happy he is.

29:35.781 --> 29:38.056
And look how he twitches his ears.

29:38.201 --> 29:40.795
Our luck is turning.
Everything is going to change.

29:47.462 --> 29:50.340
It is not only Agravain and Mordred
who gaze up at that window.

29:50.507 --> 29:55.183
No, I do too.
Guinevere is our only woman, our sunshine.

29:58.767 --> 30:00.200
Come and try out a lance.

30:01.229 --> 30:02.867
Against each other?

30:02.981 --> 30:04.175
Yes.

30:04.274 --> 30:05.992
What of our promise to Arthur?

30:06.902 --> 30:09.860
- There is no risk.
- You might skewer me.

30:12.284 --> 30:13.683
Or I might skewer you.

30:40.985 --> 30:43.055
Why did you bring me here?

30:43.196 --> 30:44.390
Why did you call me?

30:44.490 --> 30:46.321
I did not think you would come.

30:47.368 --> 30:50.007
I know it is over between us
and that it must be so.

30:50.163 --> 30:51.596
It must be so.

30:53.083 --> 30:56.075
I wanted to see you one more time
before leaving you.

31:39.056 --> 31:40.694
I left my scarf here.

31:42.477 --> 31:43.705
I am sure of it.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.299
Someone has been here.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.707
What have we done?

32:23.610 --> 32:25.601
Guinevere, my heart.

32:25.738 --> 32:28.457
Take this heart, take this soul.
They belong to you.

32:28.616 --> 32:30.129
It is your body I want.

32:31.536 --> 32:33.015
Take this forbidden body.

32:33.122 --> 32:34.919
Take it, revive it.

33:04.243 --> 33:05.562
I am afraid.

33:05.661 --> 33:07.936
I fear no one in the world.

33:08.081 --> 33:09.799
I am afraid of what awaits us.

33:09.916 --> 33:11.713
Do you not feel safe in my arms?

33:12.545 --> 33:15.218
I will not always have them to protect me.

33:15.381 --> 33:17.212
Always.

33:21.848 --> 33:23.361
Poor mad Lancelot.

33:23.475 --> 33:26.990
How can you stand your ground
in this shrinking world?

33:27.187 --> 33:30.543
Where you are, Guinevere,
the world is vast, limitless.

33:32.235 --> 33:34.544
Hold me tight. I am not a ghost.

33:52.844 --> 33:54.243
Do not undress me.

33:54.345 --> 33:57.303
Wait until tomorrow.
Do not go to the tournament.

33:58.768 --> 34:01.328
When they have gone,
come to my room.

34:23.506 --> 34:26.304
Even without crossing the line,
he will take all the honours.

34:26.468 --> 34:28.743
He has never laid claim
to the victories of others.

34:28.887 --> 34:31.242
He is a show off, gutsy.

34:31.390 --> 34:34.939
But perhaps he has more mettle
than we give him credit for.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.462
Here in the doorway.

35:34.592 --> 35:37.060
When his hand touches the door handle,

35:37.221 --> 35:39.052
do not hesitate - strike.

35:52.489 --> 35:55.879
He will suspect nothing.
He will not be armed.

35:56.077 --> 35:57.226
And if he is?

36:05.922 --> 36:08.038
Surprise him. He will not have time.

36:08.967 --> 36:13.916
The floor stained by blood will be proof
of adultery and will reveal the traitor.

36:31.370 --> 36:32.962
He is dragging us all down.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.435
Fools will never understand his sort.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.221
Luckily, he does not care.

36:37.335 --> 36:39.326
He will not be carefree forever.

36:39.463 --> 36:40.498
The hypocrite.

36:42.049 --> 36:44.882
- What do you mean, brother?
- Me?

36:45.053 --> 36:48.125
If Lancelot were here, you'd be more careful.
You'd keep quiet.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.946
You'd be cowering like a dog,
but beware.

36:51.102 --> 36:52.694
Of whom? Of you?

36:54.314 --> 36:56.464
Of this blade
that could pass through you.

36:57.318 --> 36:59.149
You are not going to fight, Lionel?

37:03.117 --> 37:05.506
Don't worry,
I am not coming to the tournament.

37:07.121 --> 37:08.270
I knew it.

37:09.207 --> 37:11.084
Can you read my thoughts, Mordred?

37:13.045 --> 37:15.605
Friendship works wonders, Mordred.

37:15.757 --> 37:18.317
As for me,
I long to know your thoughts.

37:18.469 --> 37:20.266
You will surely know them.

37:25.269 --> 37:26.782
Goodbye and good luck.

37:36.032 --> 37:38.830
Lionel and I were defending you back there.

37:38.994 --> 37:41.269
- Now I look ridiculous.
- Gaiwan.

37:41.413 --> 37:45.292
I beseech you, use this tournament
to let them see what you are worth.

37:45.501 --> 37:46.900
They seem to have forgotten.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.642
They moan about you
and besmirch your honour.

37:49.798 --> 37:52.517
You seem to enjoy
putting your friends in the wrong

37:52.677 --> 37:55.828
and those cowards in the right
with their foolish pride.

37:56.014 --> 37:58.528
I will silence them when the time comes.

38:00.436 --> 38:01.630
The time has come.

40:51.970 --> 40:55.280
Fetch a suit of white Armour
and a plain shield.

40:56.434 --> 41:00.109
There should be no one at the stable.
Saddle the red bay.

41:00.314 --> 41:01.872
Prepare two lances.
I am leaving.

41:01.982 --> 41:04.576
- At night, alone?
- Be quiet, you fool. Get a move on.

41:06.071 --> 41:08.062
And hold your tongue, or else...

41:21.131 --> 41:23.804
Forgive me, my love. I must do this.

41:23.967 --> 41:25.366
I shall not be gone long.

41:26.804 --> 41:31.161
I shall return tomorrow before nightfall
and we shall be alone together all night.

42:17.658 --> 42:19.250
Why is he not with us?

42:23.248 --> 42:24.237
Answer me.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.201
Love, Sire. Lancelot loves.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.202
Whom?

42:31.675 --> 42:32.664
The Queen.

42:33.719 --> 42:34.754
He is her knight.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.198
He is more.

42:37.348 --> 42:38.781
That is a monstrous lie.

42:38.892 --> 42:40.484
It is the truth.

42:40.602 --> 42:43.435
Mordred, you are giving vent to jealousy.

42:43.606 --> 42:45.642
Empty accusations will be punished.

42:45.775 --> 42:47.367
I swear it.

42:47.486 --> 42:49.442
Swearing does not prove anything.

42:49.571 --> 42:51.050
I swear it is false.

42:51.157 --> 42:52.749
What proof have you?

42:52.867 --> 42:54.778
My word is enough.

42:54.911 --> 42:57.471
Mordred, I order you to be silent.

43:01.544 --> 43:04.104
Gawain, what are
the conditions of the tournament?

43:04.256 --> 43:06.053
Choice of adversaries, Sire.

43:06.175 --> 43:08.166
Sharpened points, weakened lances.

46:56.238 --> 46:57.227
Lancelot.

47:16.146 --> 47:17.135
Lancelot.

47:59.690 --> 48:00.679
Lancelot.

49:09.383 --> 49:10.372
Lancelot.

50:38.809 --> 50:40.481
It was his horse.

50:42.021 --> 50:45.775
There is more than one red bay in the world
with a white star on its brow.

50:46.985 --> 50:48.862
But only one lance is a thunderbolt.

50:50.114 --> 50:53.151
And only one knight charges
with his guard down.

50:54.870 --> 50:56.861
Mordred, everything is against you.

50:56.997 --> 51:00.114
The best thing you can do now
is admit it and hold your peace.

51:06.884 --> 51:10.081
It is not the first time
he has turned up with his visor lowered

51:10.263 --> 51:12.731
and taken us on as his opponent.

51:12.892 --> 51:14.962
Can he not do anything like everyone else?

51:15.103 --> 51:17.458
Perhaps he wanted to teach you a lesson.

51:20.651 --> 51:21.845
Was it really him?

51:22.904 --> 51:24.383
Yes.

51:24.489 --> 51:27.686
My glancing blow
drove the tip of the lance into his waist.

52:42.959 --> 52:46.668
- He was the victor.
- And he is wounded?

52:49.885 --> 52:52.080
Lionel fears so but he is not sure.

52:53.097 --> 52:54.610
What are you sure of?

52:55.808 --> 52:58.641
Did you see his face?
Did he speak to anyone?

52:58.812 --> 52:59.961
No one.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.136
You are keeping something from me.

53:29.266 --> 53:31.222
Only gossip and lies.

53:41.113 --> 53:43.229
Do you understand Lancelot?

53:43.366 --> 53:45.834
He could not carry on
without destroying himself,

53:45.994 --> 53:47.985
destroying my uncle,
destroying us all.

53:48.122 --> 53:50.841
For Lancelot, deciding and charging
is one and the same.

53:51.751 --> 53:53.787
Your eyes deceived you, Gawain.

53:53.921 --> 53:55.718
It was not him at the tournament.

53:57.383 --> 53:59.692
Lancelot has gone, never to return.

54:02.014 --> 54:03.606
He has fled. He is far away.

54:31.341 --> 54:33.172
Lionel, where are you going?

54:33.302 --> 54:36.612
To challenge Mordred.
My sword will prove that he lied.

54:36.806 --> 54:40.037
Only Lancelot's sword can prove that.
Yours will prove nothing.

54:40.227 --> 54:43.936
Anyway, he will not fight,
unless you slit his throat like a chicken.

54:44.148 --> 54:45.661
What's to stop me?

55:02.504 --> 55:04.893
Carmaduc and Bohort
are going to look for him.

55:05.049 --> 55:07.517
This mess is Lancelot's doing.

55:07.677 --> 55:11.306
Why doesn't Arthur act?
"Empty accusations will be punished."

55:11.515 --> 55:14.951
Some force is manipulating us.
Arthur cannot govern it.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.793
Find him quickly.

56:04.496 --> 56:07.806
- Any news?
- Nothing, but the forest is hellish.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.391
Is it an omen?

58:14.521 --> 58:16.034
God rest his soul.

58:33.669 --> 58:35.102
So Lancelot is dead?

58:35.213 --> 58:37.363
The Queen will have to choose a new knight.

58:40.344 --> 58:41.743
Yes and without delay.

58:45.058 --> 58:46.650
I wish I could corner him.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.579
Check.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.141
With a queen and a castle?

59:09.463 --> 59:10.862
And this knight?

59:12.592 --> 59:14.628
Gone, flown. The knight is dead.

59:16.388 --> 59:17.901
You are cheating, Mordred.

59:19.851 --> 59:21.250
Not in the way you think.

59:22.020 --> 59:24.818
Explain the move
with a queen and a castle.

59:25.983 --> 59:27.382
Can you not guess?

59:30.280 --> 59:31.759
Stay where you are, Mordred.

59:31.865 --> 59:34.618
Stay out of reach of my sword.

1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:34.938
Leave, Gawain.
I want to be left alone.

1:00:38.947 --> 1:00:40.665
Do not stay here. Come with me.

1:00:43.327 --> 1:00:45.045
Are you giving orders?

1:00:45.163 --> 1:00:48.235
On bended knee,
I beg you to listen to me.

1:00:48.417 --> 1:00:50.009
You are being watched.

1:00:51.128 --> 1:00:54.200
Here is your scarf
which I found in Mordred's quarters.

1:00:54.382 --> 1:00:58.739
The traitor says you return here because
criminals return to the scene of their crime.

1:01:01.057 --> 1:01:02.092
What crime?

1:01:03.393 --> 1:01:05.702
A crime that carries a terrible punishment.

1:01:05.854 --> 1:01:08.129
I shudder to think of it.

1:01:08.274 --> 1:01:10.742
Dear Gawain,
once again I ask you to go.

1:01:11.987 --> 1:01:15.024
I wish you could do something
but you cannot do anything.

1:01:15.199 --> 1:01:16.598
I am ready for anything.

1:01:18.495 --> 1:01:20.884
I await the one who will save me.

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:24.794
Not you or anyone in the world
can drag me away from here,

1:01:25.003 --> 1:01:26.197
except by force.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:29.478
I wait for him here,

1:01:29.592 --> 1:01:32.664
alone with my pain,
as I always have done.

1:01:33.889 --> 1:01:35.845
Here I can be with him.

1:01:35.974 --> 1:01:38.010
I talk to him and he hears me.

1:01:38.144 --> 1:01:41.659
My crime is that for one instant
I doubted him.

1:01:43.525 --> 1:01:44.514
A wound,

1:01:44.610 --> 1:01:48.159
someone or something inexplicable
is keeping him from me.

1:01:48.364 --> 1:01:50.878
But he lives. I know it, I feel it.

1:01:51.034 --> 1:01:53.707
He has not abandoned me.

1:01:55.456 --> 1:01:57.492
Now go.

1:01:57.626 --> 1:02:00.265
Tell them that I love him
and that my body and soul are his.

1:02:00.421 --> 1:02:02.491
Go and tell Arthur.

1:02:05.510 --> 1:02:07.228
What are you waiting for? Go.

1:02:15.314 --> 1:02:18.943
I would give my last drop of blood
to save your life

1:02:19.152 --> 1:02:22.542
but I fear my pathetic life
weighs too little to tip the balance.

1:02:33.086 --> 1:02:35.520
Do not go in, Uncle.
Do not judge her.

1:02:46.018 --> 1:02:48.373
If you still cherish her above all else.

1:02:48.521 --> 1:02:50.113
Do you doubt it, Gawain?

1:02:56.990 --> 1:02:58.025
Go quickly.

1:03:25.274 --> 1:03:28.152
There may still be a chance.
What we are doing is worthwhile.

1:03:28.319 --> 1:03:30.879
- What?
- His rage will be terrible.

1:03:31.031 --> 1:03:32.430
We have no choice.

1:04:02.069 --> 1:04:04.537
We seek one of our men.
He may have been wounded.

1:04:07.826 --> 1:04:09.225
Nothing to say?

1:04:11.455 --> 1:04:12.729
Nothing.

1:04:43.577 --> 1:04:45.374
Don't grip me so tight.

1:04:47.415 --> 1:04:48.814
Where were you?

1:04:53.381 --> 1:04:55.417
Did you meet someone?

1:05:02.851 --> 1:05:05.001
You should be dead.

1:05:05.145 --> 1:05:07.340
But I am alive and I am leaving.

1:05:08.775 --> 1:05:10.208
In your condition?

1:05:15.992 --> 1:05:16.981
What is it?

1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:24.452
You are stupid
and you'll never understand anything.

1:05:25.462 --> 1:05:27.930
Someone keeps calling me. I must go.

1:05:37.435 --> 1:05:39.903
Go then. Go and be killed.

1:05:41.356 --> 1:05:43.153
I go to live.

1:06:33.002 --> 1:06:34.594
Lancelot, help!

1:06:38.843 --> 1:06:42.153
I am here, Guinevere.
I have come to rescue you.

1:06:45.142 --> 1:06:47.019
Don't touch me.

1:06:47.144 --> 1:06:48.736
I forbid you to come nearer.

1:06:48.855 --> 1:06:50.129
I am here, Guinevere.

1:07:03.247 --> 1:07:04.839
You are covered in blood.

1:07:13.051 --> 1:07:14.643
Lionel.

1:07:16.722 --> 1:07:18.713
They are waiting for you.
Go quickly.

1:08:00.150 --> 1:08:03.301
Nothing to be seen.
Nothing and not a sound.

1:08:10.996 --> 1:08:12.668
That means they are here.

1:08:14.209 --> 1:08:16.882
Do you know who you killed
to rescue the queen?

1:08:17.045 --> 1:08:19.605
Two shadows.
It happened so quickly.

1:08:19.757 --> 1:08:22.271
- Agravain, Gawain's brother.
- Agravain?

1:08:22.427 --> 1:08:26.340
The other man you laid out was Lucan.

1:08:26.557 --> 1:08:28.548
He did not deserve to live.

1:08:28.684 --> 1:08:29.799
And Mordred?

1:08:29.894 --> 1:08:32.931
We can wager he stayed put
and that his sword remains untainted.

1:08:33.106 --> 1:08:34.095
Not so stupid.

1:08:34.191 --> 1:08:36.989
- Is the drawbridge up?
- Yes, and these ruins are strong.

1:08:37.153 --> 1:08:40.463
- Do we have supplies, water, fodder?
- Enough for a ten-year siege.

1:08:40.657 --> 1:08:42.249
Siege?

1:08:42.368 --> 1:08:44.962
Come, Lionel, Bohort.
We are doing the attacking.

1:09:00.306 --> 1:09:02.262
Where is Gawain?

1:09:35.891 --> 1:09:38.689
Gawain killed by Lancelot?
God would not allow it.

1:09:59.503 --> 1:10:00.982
Gawain, my poor nephew.

1:10:01.088 --> 1:10:02.601
Poor Gawain.

1:10:12.769 --> 1:10:14.999
He is the victim of a murderer, Sire.

1:10:15.147 --> 1:10:16.262
Of a traitor.

1:10:18.902 --> 1:10:20.779
No.

1:10:20.904 --> 1:10:22.701
No, Gawain?

1:10:27.496 --> 1:10:29.612
It was me, it was my fault.

1:10:29.748 --> 1:10:31.340
Do not blame Lancelot.

1:10:32.460 --> 1:10:33.893
I charged him head-on.

1:10:36.590 --> 1:10:39.229
He parried and riposted
without recognising me.

1:10:44.725 --> 1:10:46.477
You must tell him

1:10:46.602 --> 1:10:50.481
that avenging Agravain
is hard to bear.

1:10:52.526 --> 1:10:55.279
But for all the rest

1:10:55.446 --> 1:10:57.038
my heart is with him.

1:10:59.576 --> 1:11:01.453
We shall avenge you, Gawain.

1:11:01.579 --> 1:11:03.570
We shall avenge you and your brother.

1:11:05.458 --> 1:11:07.847
Sire, I wanted...

1:11:09.296 --> 1:11:11.093
What did you want?

1:11:12.550 --> 1:11:15.110
You and I both wanted to save the Queen.

1:11:16.805 --> 1:11:18.557
Yes, I wanted to save her.

1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:25.733
What we could not do,

1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:27.697
Lancelot has done.

1:11:29.279 --> 1:11:31.793
Uncle, listen to me just this once.

1:11:34.202 --> 1:11:38.036
Everyone will die.
Listen to my advice.

1:11:39.750 --> 1:11:41.183
I am listening, Gawain.

1:12:01.902 --> 1:12:03.699
Gawain is dead.

1:12:08.827 --> 1:12:11.295
- Arthur offers...
- He has nothing to offer.

1:12:11.455 --> 1:12:13.685
Lancelot had him
under his horse's hooves.

1:12:13.833 --> 1:12:15.789
Aiglin cried, "Kill him! End it!"

1:12:15.919 --> 1:12:17.557
But Lancelot spared Arthur.

1:12:18.631 --> 1:12:20.986
Arthur offers to take back the Queen

1:12:21.134 --> 1:12:23.602
on the condition that Lancelot leaves.

1:12:23.762 --> 1:12:27.801
Arthur judges her innocent of
the crime of adultery for which he has no proof.

1:12:28.017 --> 1:12:30.577
He has had us all swear
respect and loyalty.

1:12:30.729 --> 1:12:33.163
That way there will be no more bloodshed.

1:12:33.315 --> 1:12:34.873
Too late. We refuse.

1:13:28.048 --> 1:13:29.800
This is our last night.

1:13:29.926 --> 1:13:32.281
Let us accept. Time is running out.

1:13:32.429 --> 1:13:33.782
I will not capitulate.

1:13:35.891 --> 1:13:38.769
We have much to atone for.
So much blood has been shed.

1:13:38.937 --> 1:13:41.212
We cannot bring the dead back to life.

1:13:43.901 --> 1:13:45.619
It was my duty to defend you.

1:13:45.737 --> 1:13:48.615
Your duty now
is to return me to Arthur.

1:13:48.782 --> 1:13:51.137
I will not hand you over to him.

1:13:53.037 --> 1:13:57.155
I delighted in deceiving him.
He arouses nothing but loathing in me.

1:13:57.376 --> 1:13:58.968
I shall rid you of Arthur.

1:14:00.129 --> 1:14:01.721
You did not kill him yesterday.

1:14:02.799 --> 1:14:05.154
If only I had, without a thought.

1:14:05.302 --> 1:14:07.099
He would have killed you if he could.

1:14:07.221 --> 1:14:09.894
I will send word
that I no longer wish to fight.

1:14:10.934 --> 1:14:13.528
He will not listen.
He has right on his side.

1:14:13.687 --> 1:14:15.484
Right is not justice.

1:14:17.775 --> 1:14:19.367
Forget justice.

1:14:21.029 --> 1:14:22.462
Stay with me, Guinevere.

1:14:24.993 --> 1:14:27.666
It was too good.
It is no longer possible.

1:14:27.829 --> 1:14:29.421
I crave the impossible.

1:14:31.208 --> 1:14:33.517
What am I to do with you?

1:14:33.670 --> 1:14:35.547
You have nothing more to ask of me.

1:14:35.672 --> 1:14:37.469
I have nothing more to give you.

1:14:38.634 --> 1:14:40.226
I have done all I could.

1:14:42.722 --> 1:14:45.634
I loved you more than any creature
in this world has ever loved.

1:14:47.019 --> 1:14:50.216
You lie.
You will never cease to love me.

1:14:50.398 --> 1:14:52.309
I shall suffer instead.

1:14:52.443 --> 1:14:54.240
Do you choose suffering?

1:14:55.279 --> 1:14:56.871
I have chosen nothing.

1:14:58.033 --> 1:14:59.830
If only I could see into your heart.

1:15:00.786 --> 1:15:03.016
You see it. It bleeds, it is torn.

1:15:04.290 --> 1:15:06.246
How can I leave you?

1:15:07.419 --> 1:15:09.614
Perhaps God demands it.

1:15:09.755 --> 1:15:11.154
He demands nothing.

1:15:12.342 --> 1:15:15.937
Am I to understand that the woman
made for me was not made for me,

1:15:16.138 --> 1:15:17.856
that all that is true is false?

1:15:18.975 --> 1:15:23.446
Decide to leave this woman
while there is still time, of your own free will.

1:15:23.689 --> 1:15:26.123
If I leave you, what remains for me?

1:15:28.236 --> 1:15:30.272
Our faith in each other,

1:15:30.405 --> 1:15:32.202
the promise we made to each other.

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:34.997
Wherever you are,
I must be there too.

1:15:36.288 --> 1:15:38.085
Even if I am a burden?

1:15:40.084 --> 1:15:41.483
Let me go.

1:15:42.754 --> 1:15:45.552
This is the first time
it is you bidding me farewell.

1:15:47.051 --> 1:15:48.848
It is the last time too.

1:15:50.013 --> 1:15:51.412
Farewell.

1:15:53.392 --> 1:15:55.747
No, I have you in my hands.

1:15:55.895 --> 1:15:57.647
I cannot let you escape.

1:16:01.777 --> 1:16:03.176
It is nearly time.

1:16:32.439 --> 1:16:34.236
I need to hold on to you.

1:16:35.401 --> 1:16:37.710
I shall walk without looking right or left.

1:18:22.615 --> 1:18:24.924
What is it, Lionel?
What is the matter?

1:18:25.076 --> 1:18:27.465
Mordred is at the castle.
He has mustered support.

1:18:27.621 --> 1:18:29.816
Carmaduc rushed here
to tell us the news.

1:18:31.209 --> 1:18:34.804
Along with a handful of men
he intends to challenge Arthur's rule.

1:18:35.005 --> 1:18:35.994
What say you?

1:18:36.882 --> 1:18:38.474
Are you asking that, Lionel?

1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:42.093
Saddle up for Arthur against Mordred.
Follow me.

1:23:22.647 --> 1:23:24.046
Guinevere.
