WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.320
Previously on St Elsewhere -

00:03.320 --> 00:05.040
   What caused him to black out?

00:05.040 --> 00:07.560
My guess is it was a resistant
strain of malaria

00:07.560 --> 00:09.680
that he picked up
on his trip to Africa.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.600
I'm a doctor. What happened?
I can't move my legs.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.400
  Still can't remember your name?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.640
I need to know, Doctor,
    I need to know who I am!

00:16.640 --> 00:19.400
Do you want me to call NASA?  No.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.920
You know how they are -
ground you for a hangnail.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.920
     What time do you get off?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.160
How you doing there, Dr Westphall?

02:03.160 --> 02:06.320
Me and Todd got a requisition
to paint your office.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.280
Signed by Dr Auschlander.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.040
Kyle!

02:13.040 --> 02:14.280
He was right behind me.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.280
Carl, this requisition's dated
two weeks ago.  Oh, yeah!

02:18.400 --> 02:21.960
Toilets on Five West needed snaking.
        Set us way back.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.360
    There's a lot of work here.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.600
This is gonna be a heck
of a distraction.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.560
Oh, you won't bother us,
          Dr Westphall.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.160
I love the fall!

02:32.160 --> 02:34.600
Oh, look at the colour
        of those leaves!

02:34.600 --> 02:36.280
Like they're on fire!

02:36.280 --> 02:38.120
Here you are.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.480
Hiya, Dr Westphall.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.440
Let's move the credenza.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.480
The credenza, huh?

02:44.480 --> 02:47.920
I thought they'd paint while you
were out of commission with malaria.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.720
The toilets on Five West needed
snaking, set them way back.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.800
Good news. Doctor Bonham called.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.240
The board's willing to approve
 two of your outreach programmes.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.840
What did we get?  Nutrition classes
and resident community services.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.560
Nothing about the family unit,
out-patient clinic?  No.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.440
          African relief?

03:03.440 --> 03:04.880
          African relief?
Donald - it's a start.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.640
Oh good, you're both here. Not you!

03:08.640 --> 03:11.640
Listen, my caseload has loosened up
and Yvonne's stable,

03:11.640 --> 03:14.840
so I'm changing my plans and taking
her home to Clinton this afternoon.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.000
Need any help chartering
the MedVac flight?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.400
Need any help chartering
the MedVac flight?
Everything's taken care of.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.080
I'll be staying there overnight.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.240
Catherine and I once
spent the night in Clinton.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.800
I can't remember why!

03:24.800 --> 03:28.800
Have a good trip.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.160
You wanted to see me?  Yes.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.080
Gloria Neal is gonna be arriving
about noon today.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.680
Is that your friend
from Washington? That WAC?

03:35.680 --> 03:37.240
Is that your friend
from Washington? That WAC?
     WAVE - she's in the Navy.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.400
Not another fire drill
for the First Lady?  No.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.360
No, she's coming to evaluate Colonel
Cochrane's condition for NASA.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.520
No, she's coming to evaluate Colonel
Cochrane's condition for NASA.
I can understand why.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.400
Did you hear that lame-brain
on the news last night?

03:46.400 --> 03:50.400
Claims his illness purified him for
some cockamamie religious crusade!

03:50.640 --> 03:51.680
Nuts in space!

03:51.680 --> 03:54.400
Hey, Carl, look at this.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.800
Doctor of the Year! Twice in a row.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.360
Twice in a row, huh?

04:00.360 --> 04:04.360
How many times you been
     Doctor of the Year?

04:05.960 --> 04:09.360
I have to meet Ellen in
Yvonne's room before the flight.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.320
See you tomorrow.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.120
How's Cochrane doing since
you took him off the respirator?

04:16.120 --> 04:18.959
Er, still has a slight case
   of purulent bronchitis.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.000
I'm continuing the epicillin.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.280
The paralysis is resolving

04:22.280 --> 04:24.320
and his upper body strength
   is returning.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.480
I sent a copy of his file
to Captain Neal,

04:26.480 --> 04:28.360
but keep yourself available.
She's gonna want to talk to you.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.880
but keep yourself available.
She's gonna want to talk to you.
OK.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.640
I see what you mean by distraction,
Dr Westphall!

04:33.640 --> 04:35.920
All that traffic you get
in and out of here -

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
don't see how you get any work done!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.200
For balance, put this one here.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.920
Go ahead.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.440
 John?  Hey, Dr West.
Why don't you give up on this guy?

04:49.440 --> 04:53.120
Ever since his operation, he doesn't
give a ding-dong about anything!

04:53.120 --> 04:54.760
He's totally apathetic.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.680
Mr Carlin, you promised you
were going to be more friendly!

04:57.680 --> 04:59.920
Talk to him? All he does is sit
around and watch the news all day!

04:59.920 --> 05:02.960
Never talks to the rest of us.
Doesn't let us watch our programmes!

05:02.960 --> 05:05.160
Why don't you give me a minute
alone with John?

05:05.160 --> 05:09.160
Why don't you give me a minute
alone with John?
Oh, with easure-play. What a maroon!

05:10.400 --> 05:13.560
   Well, how are we doing today?

05:13.560 --> 05:17.480
When Dr Somato operated, he took
out the part of my brain that cares.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.800
I was still groggy
      under the anaesthetic,

05:19.800 --> 05:22.400
but that's what I heard you
   tell Dr Auschlander.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.760
You've done better than we expected.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.600
You've done better than we expected.
New and improved -
now in a handy, take home size!

05:27.600 --> 05:31.440
John, you really should try
making new friends.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.720
        Get to know people!

05:32.720 --> 05:36.720
I don't even know myself!
    John Doe Number 6!

05:37.240 --> 05:39.880
No wonder there's no snap,
crackle, pop in my life!

05:39.880 --> 05:43.560
Your tests show that you can achieve
your previous level of socialisation.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.560
You're just not making the effort!

05:45.560 --> 05:47.840
Don't have to!
Just spray it on and whisk it away.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.400
Why'd you let Somato
put a hole in my head?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.800
You would have died
without the operation.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.280
And gone to an unmarked grave with
ring around the collar! Big deal!

05:56.280 --> 05:57.880
      John, there was a time

05:57.880 --> 06:01.880
when discovering your identity
was the most important thing to you.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.360
'Facility on Deer Island
angered neighbouring residents...'

06:07.360 --> 06:08.840
Newscasters.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.960
They know who they are!

06:10.960 --> 06:14.080
Huntley, Brinkley...

06:14.080 --> 06:17.360
"Good night, Chet.
       Good night, David!"

06:17.360 --> 06:21.320
Walter Cronkite -
"And that's the way it is!"

06:21.320 --> 06:24.800
Edward R Murrow -
"Good night and good luck."

06:24.800 --> 06:27.920
          I got an idea..

06:27.920 --> 06:30.200
Don't touch that dial!

06:30.200 --> 06:32.480
What's the point anyway?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.320
I think I've got
Excedrin headache number 68!

06:35.320 --> 06:39.320
           No more news!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.240
       It's too depressing!

06:42.240 --> 06:45.200
I want you to watch shows
that will lift your soul.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.720
     Put a smile on your face.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.600
Have a Yabba Dabba Doo time, huh?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.880
             Exactly!

06:50.880 --> 06:52.120
Hey, The White Shadow!

06:52.120 --> 06:54.360
Now you're interested in yucks.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.760
Whoever thought of this one
   was a real smoothie!

06:57.760 --> 07:00.960
Oooh!

07:00.960 --> 07:03.760
NEWS PLAYS

07:03.760 --> 07:07.760
MUSIC PLAYS

07:10.440 --> 07:13.120
You change that one more time,
I'll break your face!  Mr Carlin!

07:13.120 --> 07:17.120
Remember what I said
about being friendly?

07:17.200 --> 07:21.200
I'll break your face... Please.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.920
I bought that for the trip.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.920
The Galeckis never thought
    to send Yvonne pyjamas.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.200
Yet they criticise the way
    we raised Stephen!

07:33.520 --> 07:35.800
They're going to have
their hands full now,

07:35.800 --> 07:38.480
  caring for Yvonne and Barbara.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.120
Mark, you promised
   Barbara would live with us.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.880
I miss her.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.440
             So do I.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.640
She's as much our granddaughter
 as she is theirs.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.840
Ellen, we've been over
this a hundred times.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.160
The lawyers say that Stephen
and Yvonne's will is airtight.

07:54.160 --> 07:58.160
The Galeckis are Barbara's guardians.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.600
     Do you think I sleep easy

07:59.600 --> 08:03.080
knowing a member of my family
is growing up in a trailer park?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.360
I called the Registry

08:04.360 --> 08:07.800
and and a nurse is on her way over
to assist with the flight.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.080
Take off from Logan is in two hours.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.120
Take off from Logan is in two hours.
               Fine.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.320
Would you mind getting me another
towel so I can dry Yvonne's hair?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.360
Would you mind getting me another
towel so I can dry Yvonne's hair?
Sure.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.320
How much longer is this gonna take?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.720
Almost finished.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.320
Oh, Mark,
I just want to hold her again.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.280
I want to smell behind her neck.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.160
Have her stare up at me
with those big dark eyes.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.080
All right, Ellen, I'll do my best.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.160
I know you're a man
of your word, Mark.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.640
I'll see you at home. Tomorrow night.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.640
With our granddaughter?

08:45.040 --> 08:48.240
I want you to take a look
at Mrs Glover.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.480
Stitches have been taken out.
  The wound is clean and dry.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.280
You think you've got my
department down, don't you?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.160
You think you've got my
department down, don't you?
Just trying to get everything done.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.280
Don't want anything to get
   in the way of our vacation.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.560
What do you think about Bermuda?
 Coral reefs, seas...?

09:00.560 --> 09:04.320
What do you think of Mrs Kilmartin?
Low-grade fever, peripheral oedema?

09:04.320 --> 09:07.920
Her diuretics have been restarted.
Per your order.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.080
What do you say, huh?
Virgin Islands...?

09:11.080 --> 09:14.880
One little error in judgment
   and he's scarred for life.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.440
Oh, my God!

09:16.440 --> 09:18.280
Yeah! It's good to see you, too!

09:18.280 --> 09:20.160
Would you like the full profile?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.040
I'm sorry, Bob.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.040
Everyone's sorry.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.520
           Has he gone?

09:31.520 --> 09:33.960
Victor?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.160
What's going on?

09:35.160 --> 09:37.160
    Jackie, I need some advice.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.800
            On the run.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.200
Two days ago, Mr Boynton signed in
for removal of a ganglion in his arm.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.560
All well and good. Later, I found Bob
sold this guy on an eye lift too.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.560
So, what's the problem?  Come here...

09:51.240 --> 09:55.240
Plastic surgery candidates are
supposed to be highly motivated
to change their appearance.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.680
    Boynton's not.  Talk to Bob.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.560
   "Talk to Bob!" I did! I did!

10:00.560 --> 10:02.720
He said I've got a decision to make.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.920
      Either I button my lips

10:03.920 --> 10:06.800
or I can forget about completing
my plastics rotation.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.880
I've been avoiding him
until I can figure out what to do!

10:08.880 --> 10:10.920
I've been avoiding him
until I can figure out what to do!
Bob performing unnecessary surgery?!

10:10.920 --> 10:12.720
           Not so loud!

10:12.720 --> 10:14.000
    He's lost his objectivity.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.720
Word's out on the hospital mojo wire,

10:15.720 --> 10:18.520
the Resident Review Committee
won't recertify plastics

10:18.520 --> 10:20.960
unless Bob brings up
the number of elective surgeries.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.400
Look, Victor...

10:21.400 --> 10:22.440
Look, Victor...
           Keep moving!

10:22.440 --> 10:25.240
I can't believe
    that he would knowingly...

10:25.240 --> 10:26.520
        Jackie, it's true!

10:26.520 --> 10:29.960
Look, I know I'm a terrible person.
A brown nose and a gladhander,

10:29.960 --> 10:32.640
I'd stop at almost nothing to get
ahead - but this is serious!

10:32.640 --> 10:35.320
If I just sit by, I don't think
I'd be able to live with myself!

10:35.320 --> 10:37.960
I can barely live
with myself as it is.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.160
  Oh, great! Great, I'm trapped!

10:40.160 --> 10:41.880
Not necessarily.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.480
There's still someone else
    you can talk to.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.800
There's still someone else
    you can talk to.
      Who? Westphall? Craig?

10:44.800 --> 10:48.440
No, Boynton! Maybe he really
does want the blepharoplasty.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.480
Then you'd be off the hook!

10:50.480 --> 10:52.720
I knew you'd come through!
Let's hope Boynton does!

10:52.720 --> 10:54.680
You know what amazes me, Victor?

10:54.680 --> 10:55.040
               What?

10:55.040 --> 10:59.040
               What?
You actually have a conscience.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.960
Yvonne?

11:14.760 --> 11:18.760
Nurse! Would you get Dr Craig,
  please? Right away.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.040
Yvonne?

11:25.160 --> 11:29.160
TV PLAYS

11:43.360 --> 11:46.640
That TV's filled with real people!
They do the craziest things!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.800
Yeah. And they're only this tall.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.960
Television's the mirror of our soul.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.960
We look in, we see who we really are.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.480
CAT MIAOWS

12:01.480 --> 12:04.880
            That's it.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.840
         I know who I am!

12:06.840 --> 12:10.840
          I know who I am!

12:11.480 --> 12:15.480
Mary Richards! I'm Mary Richards, hi!

12:15.520 --> 12:19.520
Oh, I can turn the world on
with a smile!

12:19.800 --> 12:23.720
           Hi! Hey, hi!

12:23.720 --> 12:27.480
Right after I paged you,
Yvonne closed her eyes again.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.280
     Yvonne? Can you hear me?

12:31.280 --> 12:35.280
Yvonne, I want you
to watch my finger.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.520
         Watch my finger.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.520
   Yvonne, you're in a hospital.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.440
       Do you know who I am?

12:44.440 --> 12:47.240
All right, let's get her
ready for transport.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.560
I want 130 milligrams of
phenobarbital standing by

12:50.560 --> 12:53.000
to administer
at first sign of seizure.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.760
When you get downstairs,
put her on an oxygen nasal cannula.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.160
Mark, is Yvonne waking up?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.120
Return to full consciousness
is difficult to predict.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.760
Most likely she's just
entering a lighter coma.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.760
       All right, let's go.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.520
It was obvious
     from the records we sent

13:11.520 --> 13:13.680
that Colonel Cochrane's
     gonna be fine.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.800
Why did Government spend
the money flying up here?

13:16.800 --> 13:19.320
They want to get him home
as quickly as possible.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.280
How would you evaluate
the Colonel's mental state?

13:22.280 --> 13:23.320
How would you evaluate
the Colonel's mental state?
Good.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.400
He knows the paralysis is temporary.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.040
He's hoping for a full recovery

13:27.040 --> 13:29.880
in time to make his next flight
 on the Space Shuttle.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.840
When his wife informed us about the
dream, we didn't think much of it.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.080
Some astronauts experience
varying degrees of delusions,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.840
nervous distress,
co-ordination difficulties.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.920
But after a statement to the press,

13:40.920 --> 13:44.920
well, frankly, the brass
got slightly tarnished.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.560
Colonel, Mrs Cochrane,
this is Captain Neal.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.080
              Hello.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.280
              Hello.
Hello, Captain.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.920
Commander Healy asked me to pass on
the best wishes of everyone at NASA.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.920
He was surprised you didn't notify
him of your change in medical status.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.840
I'm sure you have a very good reason.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.520
You tell Commander not to worry.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.760
This place is regular Navy -

14:03.760 --> 14:06.520
lousy food, clean sheets,
and all the ice cream you can eat.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.360
You're making remarkable progress.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.800
You're making remarkable progress.
Chuck held a glass this morning.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.360
Yesterday, he still
couldn't move his fingers.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.240
The paralysis is going away.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.880
Of course, dear.
Christ is my physician.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.760
Of course, dear.
Christ is my physician.
           Jesus Christ?

14:19.760 --> 14:22.880
He's healing me spiritually, too.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.560
Hosanna in the highest.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.560
Perhaps you and I should talk alone.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.360
Would you like to tell me
about your dream?

14:44.360 --> 14:47.040
The one you spoke about
on television?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.880
The dream didn't really matter.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.200
The Lord's opened my eyes,
that's what's important.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.160
During my last flight,
 when I went outside the shuttle

14:56.160 --> 14:59.000
to repair the satellite...

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
It took courage - a leap of faith.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.280
Would my life support
      equipment sustain me?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.880
Had the NASA engineers
      done their homework?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.800
But now,

15:11.800 --> 15:15.800
I realise there's one leap of faith
I've always been afraid to take.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.880
Do I believe God is
       who he says he is?

15:23.360 --> 15:27.360
After all, it's not who can conquer
outer space, but who created it.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
There is a heaven.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
I have to be on that next shuttle,
because I'm gonna walk with God.

15:36.840 --> 15:40.840
And change the world.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.320
Weiss?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.920
We got a real problem here.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.920
PHONE RINGS

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
  Good morning! WJM TV newsroom!

15:55.200 --> 15:56.960
Doe thinks he's Mary Richards.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.440
             Gotta go.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.600
Mr Grant! How are you this morning?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.600
  Let me get you a cup of coffee.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.640
Look, Weiss - you can
   let your MD be your excuse,

16:06.640 --> 16:08.680
but I gotta say -
      this one's your fault.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.680
He's been watching TV all morning,
just like you told him.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.720
           Here you are.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.240
Why don't we go to my office?

16:18.240 --> 16:21.560
I really shouldn't leave my desk,
Mr Grant. Can we talk here?

16:21.560 --> 16:23.080
Mr Carlin will watch your desk.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.880
Mr Carlin will watch your desk.
         You mean Rhoda?!

16:24.880 --> 16:27.360
Don't be silly!
She doesn't work here!

16:27.360 --> 16:30.680
She's just visiting on her way
back from lunch! Right, Rhoda?

16:30.680 --> 16:33.320
Straighten out this fruitcake,
  will you?

16:33.320 --> 16:37.320
Come on, John. Come on.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.640
Do you know what city you're in?

16:39.640 --> 16:41.000
           Minneapolis!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.320
Boston.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.320
You are not Mary Richards.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.200
          My mother says,

16:50.200 --> 16:53.600
"Mary, isn't it lonely
being a young, single career woman?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.720
"Freezing your can off
in the Midwest?"

16:55.720 --> 16:57.720
And I say,
"Gee, Mum, no, not really."

16:57.720 --> 16:59.720
Cos I'm surrounded by
such wonderful friends.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.680
Sometimes the people you work with
aren't just people you work with...

17:02.680 --> 17:04.520
Sometimes the people you work with
aren't just people you work with...
John, just slow down.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.520
I'm having a little party later.
Hope you'll come? Bring Edie! Oh...

17:11.560 --> 17:14.760
              Murray!

17:14.760 --> 17:15.880
              Murray!

17:15.880 --> 17:19.800
          Murray, Murray!

17:19.800 --> 17:23.800
Caldwell was right about one thing -
sales is a young man's world.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
A tuck around the eyes
might help me keep the winning edge.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.840
Mr Boynton, before
you talked with Dr Caldwell,

17:31.840 --> 17:34.480
did you ever give serious thought
to having plastic surgery?

17:34.480 --> 17:35.840
did you ever give serious thought
to having plastic surgery?
Not at all!

17:35.840 --> 17:39.840
You know, at one time, I was
the top go-getter in the company.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.440
There's nothing wrong
with looking your age.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.640
Take it from someone who's
looked 12 for the past 18 years!

17:46.640 --> 17:48.440
You don't think I
should have the surgery?

17:48.440 --> 17:49.880
You don't think I
should have the surgery?
    That's not what I'm saying.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.120
Exactly. Let me ask you, did you
talk with Dr Caldwell at length

17:53.120 --> 17:54.920
 about having the blepharoplasty?

17:54.920 --> 17:55.760
The what?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.040
The what?
           The eye tuck?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.280
Oh! No.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.200
But you have considered
this carefully?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.080
But you have considered
this carefully?
Well, not really.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.720
It just seemed to make sense while
I was having the ganglion removed.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.520
Having the tyres rotated while you're
having the oil changed is one thing.

18:09.520 --> 18:13.520
This is a cosmetic adjustment
that'll alter the way you look
for the rest of your life.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.080
Maybe I should give the idea
   some more thought.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.880
          Wish you would!

18:19.880 --> 18:21.840
Not in any hurry.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.720
Can always have it done later on.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.720
Would you put the 86 on the surgery
for me? You don't have to ask twice.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.120
I'll withdraw
 the authorisation immediately.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.720
I'll withdraw
 the authorisation immediately.
     Dr Ehrlich, good advice.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.720
Completely out of character,
   believe me!

18:40.160 --> 18:40.560
          Listen, Phil...

18:40.560 --> 18:41.960
          Listen, Phil...
Not now, Victor, I'm late.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.680
Roxanne's waiting in the OB lab.
The Valery fertilisation.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.800
I'm to attend this party
as Murray Slaughter...?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.200
        And I as Mr Grant.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.480
You're joking.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.520
 No, on the contrary! I'm serious.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.520
This party will enable John to
establish meaningful social contact.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.600
Even if only in the sheltered
environment of the psych ward.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.360
Do you suspect a calculated
   behaviour on his part?

19:05.360 --> 19:08.280
I guess it's only an attempt
for secondary gain -

19:08.280 --> 19:10.400
      getting our attention.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.320
What about his gender conversion?

19:12.320 --> 19:15.520
That's no more harmful
than Uncle Mildy in drag.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.640
Or a young boy trying on
his mother's shoes.

19:18.640 --> 19:22.640
You only have a problem when that boy
starts wearing down the heels.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.680
Simon, how can you joke about this?

19:24.680 --> 19:27.960
    Daniel, I'm happy for John.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.160
This is his first effort at
significant social interaction

19:31.160 --> 19:32.640
       since the operation.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.400
He's even trying
to befriend Mr Carlin!

19:36.400 --> 19:39.920
I can't go along with you
on reinforcing John's delusion

19:39.920 --> 19:41.480
that he's a TV character.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.400
We're not. We're not. But we should
respond positively to his invitation.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.400
But why did he choose
to be Mary Richards?

19:49.400 --> 19:52.240
They're kindred spirits.
They're both single,

19:52.240 --> 19:55.840
both searching for their identities
in a topsy-turvy world.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.560
And the fact that Mary
has a job at a news station

19:58.560 --> 20:02.560
gives her even more credibility
in John's mind.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.840
Viewers sit in front
      of their televisions,

20:08.840 --> 20:12.320
believing the characters
 they see there actually exist -

20:12.320 --> 20:14.440
eat, breathe, sleep.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.320
People enjoy projecting
themselves into fantasy.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.320
Our lives get dull. If TV gets dull,
you change the channel. Change life.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.080
You think this party
  will be good therapy for John?

20:26.080 --> 20:27.760
            Yes. I do.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.040
All right, I'll attend.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.200
With misgivings.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.520
               Good.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.880
           Oh, Daniel...

20:36.880 --> 20:40.720
If you could be anyone
on television, who would it be?

20:40.720 --> 20:43.200
Trapper John.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.200
He's a reassuring doctor who
never fails to save his patients.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.240
How was lunch?

20:54.240 --> 20:55.480
Very nice.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.800
    Thanks for recommending it.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.480
Speaking of lunch...

20:57.480 --> 20:58.560
Speaking of lunch...
       I'll get you a chair.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.080
Don't bother.
I have to meet Dr Weiss up in psych.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.000
He's done some tests
on my astronaut.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.040
    You think Cochrane's crazy?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.840
    You think Cochrane's crazy?
Just covering all the bases.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.480
My job is to assemble information

21:07.480 --> 21:09.320
and get the Colonel
       back to Bethesda.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.800
So once he's there then the experts
can determine how sick he is?

21:11.800 --> 21:12.840
So once he's there then the experts
can determine how sick he is?
Exactly.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.200
My responsibility falls somewhere

21:15.200 --> 21:18.760
between welcome wagon hostess
  and escort service!

21:18.760 --> 21:19.760
    And that's enough for you?

21:19.760 --> 21:20.800
    And that's enough for you?
Sure.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.280
You know, in Med school, you were
so full of promise and enthusiasm.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.120
That was because
      I was the only woman!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.400
Desperate to impress!

21:28.400 --> 21:31.440
You know, if I learned anything
at all in Ethiopia, Gloria,

21:31.440 --> 21:34.080
it's that we can't let
our talents just slide away.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.840
We have too many benefits
that other people don't have.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.680
When you're intense, you're so sexy!

21:38.680 --> 21:40.440
When you're intense, you're so sexy!
             (LAUGHS)

21:40.440 --> 21:42.520
Well, I've got to go.

21:42.520 --> 21:43.480
Dinner at my hotel?

21:43.480 --> 21:47.480
Dinner at my hotel?
            You're on.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.480
The fertility drug worked great.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.800
Eight healthy ova are ripe
    and ready for the picking.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.000
How many will be used for implant?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.280
Three. Even though each embryo
  only stands a small chance,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.520
we don't want Terry
     ending up with a litter!

22:05.520 --> 22:08.280
Chandler - where'd you learn
   about having babies?

22:08.280 --> 22:12.280
       Junior high, biology.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.320
And three girls who hung out
together. Cookie and the twins.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.320
Then I'll skip the basics and cut
right to the in vitro fertilisation.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.840
Terry's ova have been maturing in
a nutrient solution for six hours.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.560
I'll never forget the day
my mother told me she was pregnant.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.360
We'll need to check periodically
 to make sure

22:32.360 --> 22:34.600
the cells are dividing properly.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.400
I was so excited. Another brother.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.320
      Or maybe even a sister.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.920
She'd say to people,
"You'd better leave me alone

22:41.920 --> 22:43.800
"or my big brother
will beat you up!

22:43.800 --> 22:47.800
Time to introduce Mrs Valery's eggs
to Mr Valery's sperm...

22:49.640 --> 22:52.160
I remember being
so protective of her.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.160
I didn't want anything
to happen to that baby.

22:56.280 --> 23:00.280
At the start of the third month,
she miscarried anyway.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.680
All the potential for a human being,

23:02.680 --> 23:05.000
everything the Valery child
   will ever be,

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
is decided the instant Ken's sperm
penetrates Terry's egg.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.640
Sex.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.520
Hair colour. Eye colour.
     Height. Weight.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.520
Inclination to hang out
    with Cookie and the twins!

23:22.280 --> 23:25.920
What's interesting about life
is the surprise.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.840
By gaining knowledge, unravelling
DNA, we lose mystery.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.200
The secret's still there, Chandler.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
Take a look.

23:38.040 --> 23:42.040
The creation of life.

23:48.840 --> 23:52.840
The bruises on her face are gone.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.040
The people here should have
taken care of that paperwork.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.560
Spike Jones medical centre.
Let me help.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.360
I can do it.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.360
Do you want to visit with
your daughter or fill out forms?

24:08.120 --> 24:10.360
Let me handle the
insurance company, too.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.600
I've had experience in these things.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.720
        So where's Barbara?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.120
Our son Glen's looking after her.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.520
She's a little young
to be left alone...

24:19.520 --> 24:23.040
He and his wife have had experience
bringing up their own children.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.200
Yvonne's awake again! Sweetheart?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.600
Sweetheart...

24:28.600 --> 24:30.160
              Yvonne?

24:30.160 --> 24:32.120
    I want you to grab my hand.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.520
    Come on, reach for my hand.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.840
              Jean...

24:34.840 --> 24:37.880
      Step in, meet her eyes.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.920
Honey?

24:38.920 --> 24:39.800
              Louder!

24:39.800 --> 24:43.120
              Louder!
It's Mom and Pop.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.840
You're home!

24:46.840 --> 24:50.840
Don't go!

24:51.880 --> 24:54.680
We'll want a physical therapist
up here to evaluate.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.680
    Assuming this dump has one.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.840
Yvonne didn't recognise us.
She doesn't know who we are.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.640
Opening her eyes is a positive sign.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.040
There's still a chance your daughter
will have a full recovery.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.240
You believe in miracles, huh?

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
You believe in miracles, huh?
    I believe in possibilities.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.760
There's no telling how complete
Yvonne's recovery might be.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.720
I mean, this is the start
of a long haul.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.200
It's gonna be hard work for you both.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.160
I'm gonna check into the hotel
and I'll stop back here after dinner.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.480
I'm gonna check into the hotel
and I'll stop back here after dinner.
You're gonna stay with us.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.880
No, no. Er, thank you.
But I have a reservation waiting.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.280
When we were in Boston, you invited
Patti and me to stay at your home.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.680
   I don't want to put you out.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.040
We're not good enough for you,
  is that it?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.680
Patti doesn't want to have dinner,

25:44.680 --> 25:47.280
but I'm gonna take you
to the best restaurant in town.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.280
And after that,
we'll go back to the trailer.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.680
RADIO IS ON

25:57.680 --> 26:01.680
            OK, again.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.960
TURNS RADIO OFF

26:08.960 --> 26:11.480
Why'd you do that?

26:11.480 --> 26:15.480
I just thought it might help
Dr Morrison with what he's doing.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.920
Have a good rest, Colonel?

26:20.920 --> 26:23.400
Wisdom is often revealed
to us while we sleep.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.640
Commander Healy wants me to speed
up your transfer to Bethesda.  Why?

26:26.640 --> 26:28.120
We'll be more comfortable

26:28.120 --> 26:31.440
if we can monitor Colonel
Cochrane's progress ourselves.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.480
Prior to the next space shuttle.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.440
Prior to the next space shuttle.
I've been praying.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.840
I don't know why,
  or what he has planned for me,

26:36.840 --> 26:38.440
but the Lord wants me to stay here.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.160
but the Lord wants me to stay here.
He does?

26:40.160 --> 26:42.480
God will give me my watchword
  when he's ready.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.680
Maybe you've
     misinterpreted his will?

26:44.680 --> 26:47.920
In any case, I'm afraid you
  really don't have that choice.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.080
This is an order
      from Commander Healy.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.240
I can't serve two masters.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.640
Chuck...

26:54.640 --> 26:57.040
If we go to Bethesda,
I'll send for the kids.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.720
They can come up from school in
Texas. We'll all be together.  No.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.120
Colonel, come with me now,

27:02.120 --> 27:05.040
or you could be facing AWOL
charges and a court martial.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.040
NASA will have a battalion
of military quacks dissecting me.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.200
Give me a little help here,
would you, Dr Morrison?

27:13.200 --> 27:16.840
If Dr Morrison refuses to discharge
me because of medical reasons,

27:16.840 --> 27:20.200
then I'm within regulations.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.800
Can I sign the release form?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.720
Stay out of this, Jo.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.200
Don't let them take me.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.720
They are jealous because I
found the way and they haven't.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.960
They're gonna destroy me.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.600
The Colonel has developed
a slight case of bronchitis.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.440
That hardly constitutes
    a reason not to transport!

27:37.440 --> 27:40.920
If I weren't in the military,
  just anybody off the street,

27:40.920 --> 27:44.240
would you let this happen?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.160
I won't discharge Colonel Cochrane.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.800
He's obviously upset.
What's a few more days here?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.960
You're both making a big mistake!

27:50.960 --> 27:53.120
I'm gonna speak with Dr Westphall.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.120
Mrs Cochrane, maybe
you'd like to join me?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.320
             Ehrlich!

28:03.320 --> 28:04.520
              Ehrlich!

28:04.520 --> 28:05.920
What? What's going on?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.040
           You tell me!

28:07.040 --> 28:09.440
Offering contradictory
medical advice to a patient?

28:09.440 --> 28:11.720
Cancelling surgery
without authorisation?

28:11.720 --> 28:12.760
Cancelling surgery
without authorisation?
What, Mr Boynton?

28:12.760 --> 28:16.720
Going behind an attending's back
is a good way to get your butt
kicked out of this hospital!

28:16.720 --> 28:19.120
Bob, I know you're all stressed-out
because of the accident...

28:19.120 --> 28:21.200
Bob, I know you're all stressed-out
because of the accident...
 That has nothing to do with this!

28:21.200 --> 28:24.880
I want you to go talk to Mr Boynton
and tell him you acted rashly.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.680
He doesn't need the surgery, OK?

28:26.680 --> 28:29.400
And just because your
department's in trouble...

28:29.400 --> 28:30.600
St Eligius is a teaching hospital!

28:30.600 --> 28:34.000
If you don't learn how to do proper
procedure here, where will you?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.400
That still doesn't justify
unnecessary surgery!

28:35.400 --> 28:37.120
That still doesn't justify
unnecessary surgery!
     This is elective surgery.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.160
There's every reason to believe
the patient will benefit.

28:40.160 --> 28:44.160
Unnecessary surgery is totally
different. All the risk, no gain.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.360
You reschedule Boynton for tomorrow.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.000
You cross me again, and
I'll come down on you so hard

28:49.000 --> 28:51.440
you won't be able
to get into barber school!

28:51.440 --> 28:54.240
I'm still gonna have to
     go to Craig about this.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.640
When he gets back, that is.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.800
Who do you think
he's gonna listen to?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.800
The surgeon he recruited
personally from Duke?

29:00.800 --> 29:04.800
     Or the department clown?

29:06.520 --> 29:09.920
I'm drawing the third embryo
   into the syringe.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.240
OK, relax your knees a little,
I'm placing the speculum.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.200
I've seen you so often
      at this angle,

29:15.200 --> 29:19.200
I feel like yodelling to you
   up the canyon!

29:19.840 --> 29:22.960
Let's hope one of them digs in
  and settles down.

29:22.960 --> 29:26.960
If this works, do me a favour - don't
name your baby something stupid.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.080
I mean, whatever happened
to the old names?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.640
 Like John, Mark, Thomas, Bruce...

29:32.640 --> 29:36.640
I had an uncle
   named Norbert Ulysses David.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.760
So much for the old names!

29:38.760 --> 29:42.760
There's toddlers running around today
with names like Dawn and Heather.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.640
My niece's name is Heather!

29:45.640 --> 29:47.560
              Sorry.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.280
Don't be! She's a brat!

29:51.280 --> 29:52.520
        Look, it's simple.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.520
You hit the little ball back and
forth over the net. You'll catch on.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.880
You see! You see, Chuckles lived
 to make people laugh.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.800
A little song, a little dance,
a little seltzer down your pants,

30:05.800 --> 30:09.040
but you know, after he was killed,
I said, it's just not funny.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.040
The man was shot to death
in a peanut costume by an elephant!

30:15.240 --> 30:17.680
Bye, Gordy.

30:17.680 --> 30:21.680
I treasure you people.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.000
Rhoda! You finished
all the Swedish meatballs!

30:28.000 --> 30:30.040
I made them specially
      for Phyllis and Lars.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.840
   Phyllis and Lars aren't here.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.880
They never will be. They don't exist!

30:33.880 --> 30:36.080
And the only meatball
around here is you!

30:36.080 --> 30:37.320
Oh, Rhoda!

30:37.320 --> 30:38.920
Look, I'm telling you -
I'm not Rhoda.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.960
Look, I'm telling you -
I'm not Rhoda.
Ted!

30:41.960 --> 30:43.480
So glad you could make it.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.360
Where's Georgette?

30:44.360 --> 30:46.720
Where's Georgette?
Georgette's not coming.
Cos that's not Ted.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.640
I'm not Rhoda, and you're not Mary!

30:48.640 --> 30:52.320
Rhoda, you've been so grumpy
   ever since Joe dumped you!

30:52.320 --> 30:55.080
Bess!

30:55.080 --> 30:57.000
      That's not Bess either.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.240
Face it, Doe -
you can't be Mary Richards.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.280
     You don't have the legs.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.760
Mr Grant! Murray!
So glad you could make it.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.160
Don't tell me you're buying
into this Mary Richards stuff?

31:07.160 --> 31:09.200
Don't tell me you're buying
into this Mary Richards stuff?
Thank you for inviting us.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.040
 It's a lousy party. Right, Mare?

31:13.040 --> 31:17.040
Rhoda, I wouldn't say that
it's a lousy party, exactly!

31:17.080 --> 31:18.880
More like this party's...

31:18.880 --> 31:22.880
really...not lousy!

31:23.160 --> 31:24.360
              (SOBS)

31:24.360 --> 31:26.960
I haven't had this much fun
since I was rolfed!

31:26.960 --> 31:28.120
SOBBING CONTINUES

31:28.120 --> 31:30.040
Oh, Mr Grant!

31:30.040 --> 31:33.320
I made everyone so miserable!

31:33.320 --> 31:35.280
(SOBS)

31:35.280 --> 31:39.280
All I wanted to do was have
some friends over and have a party!

31:41.200 --> 31:43.760
I tried...

31:43.760 --> 31:47.760
really...hard.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.200
   This punch is a little warm.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.200
I'll get more ice.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.920
Sue-Anne? Sue-Anne!

32:04.920 --> 32:06.440
The Happy Homemaker!

32:06.440 --> 32:09.440
I'm afraid you have me confused
with someone else.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.240
I'm Mary!

32:11.240 --> 32:13.400
You know...

32:13.400 --> 32:14.680
Mary!

32:14.680 --> 32:18.680
              Sorry.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.080
Not much of an appetite.
Not much of a meal.

32:48.080 --> 32:52.080
Too much lemon juice on the veal
scaloppini - or whatever that was.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.880
Play darts?

32:54.880 --> 32:58.880
Only when I can't get a lane
   at the Bowl-o-Drome.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.880
Want to throw a round till
 the Apple Brown Betty shows up?

33:01.880 --> 33:05.440
Want to throw a round till
 the Apple Brown Betty shows up?
Not in the mood.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.480
Stephen said you were competitive.

33:07.480 --> 33:11.480
What's wrong with being competitive?

33:12.600 --> 33:14.640
What else did Stephen say about me?

33:14.640 --> 33:18.640
Isn't it enough you have to ask?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.640
What's the game?

33:25.640 --> 33:28.040
Oh, no! I don't want
       to steal your money.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.120
Let's try.

33:29.120 --> 33:33.120
How about Rotation
      for the dinner cheque?

33:33.280 --> 33:36.160
I think I can afford that.

33:36.160 --> 33:40.160
You know, Steve and I had
a lot of good times here.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.200
I thought you were good
     at this game.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.200
You know, Craig, you may
  not like me, but your son did.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.920
And he trusted me.

33:48.920 --> 33:52.360
That's why he said we would give
Barbara the best life possible.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.480
That's why he named us
to take care of the child.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.000
I'm sure you'd like to believe that.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.600
The truth of the matter is,

33:59.600 --> 34:03.560
giving you Barbara was Stephen's
way of slapping me in the face.

34:03.560 --> 34:07.560
One last time.

34:07.600 --> 34:11.600
Bull's eye.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.719
Rhoda, stop it!
Just because I didn't invite Brenda!

34:21.719 --> 34:24.199
Hey guys - tell him
what a great party this is.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.719
To be perfectly frank,
I came full of doubt,

34:26.719 --> 34:27.560
but you throw a great shindig!

34:27.560 --> 34:29.560
but you throw a great shindig!
Everybody's having a terrific time!

34:29.560 --> 34:31.360
             See?  No!

34:31.360 --> 34:32.880
What's the matter?

34:32.880 --> 34:35.000
Nobody's supposed to be having fun!

34:35.000 --> 34:37.159
Mary always throws lousy parties!

34:37.159 --> 34:39.520
Everyone has a rotten time!

34:39.520 --> 34:41.600
This is my world, and welcome to it.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.280
          James Thurbert.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.320
Maybe I'm not Mary.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.880
Maybe I'm not Mary.
Now we're making progress.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.400
If I'm making progress,
why am I feeling so unhappy?

34:51.400 --> 34:53.159
If I'm making progress,
why am I feeling so unhappy?
It's part of the process.

34:53.159 --> 34:57.160
    No, that's mine! Come here!

35:01.080 --> 35:03.440
Oooh! I know you!

35:03.440 --> 35:06.680
You're Mr Coleman -
WJM station manager.

35:06.680 --> 35:10.400
First you fired everybody except Ted
and now you want to hurt Rhoda!

35:10.400 --> 35:14.400
You'll have to go through me first!

35:14.560 --> 35:15.600
SHOUTING

35:15.600 --> 35:18.200
John! John, are you alright?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.800
John! Are you all right?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.680
I think so!

35:22.680 --> 35:24.760
Oh!

35:24.760 --> 35:27.720
I committed a violent act.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.000
Mary would never, ever do that.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.560
Mary would never, ever do that.
  You took it on the chin for me!

35:30.560 --> 35:32.680
 Only a real friend would do that.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.680
       Yeah. Call me Rhoda.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.120
No.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.480
I'm not Mary.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.480
We've just been cancelled.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.960
Let's move this back.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.200
Move this back, huh?

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
Ma'am.  Oh, excuse me.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.640
You like being a stewardess?

35:58.640 --> 35:59.880
I'm a captain.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.640
No kidding! Which airline?

36:01.640 --> 36:04.000
Fellas, would you excuse us, please?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.080
We'll be off in the clock
    in 10 minutes.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.280
We don't finish tonight, there's no
telling when it's gonna get done!

36:08.280 --> 36:12.280
We don't finish tonight, there's no
telling when it's gonna get done!
       I'll take my chances.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.800
Thank you, Donald.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.400
Dr Morrison tried to stop me
from transferring Colonel Cochrane.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.760
One thing's for sure -

36:23.760 --> 36:26.960
NASA won't be sending the Colonel
on another mission.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.680
I think he's returned from
    space a born-again mess.

36:29.680 --> 36:33.440
I don't understand why his spiritual
awakening should disqualify him.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.040
He's shouting from the mountain top
about walking with God.

36:37.040 --> 36:41.040
The public'll think we're sending
religious zealots into space!
They'll lose conference in NASA.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.560
 NASA's gonna lose some tax money?

36:43.560 --> 36:46.840
The fact of the matter is,
there is one mission control.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.960
Colonel Cochrane is no longer
  interested in taking orders.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.560
His abilities are impaired
if he's clearing everything
   through the Book of Genesis!

36:53.560 --> 36:57.160
Well, you'd know better
about that than I, but...

36:57.160 --> 36:59.960
I hope you aren't making protocol
more important than your patient.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.280
Donald, why are you being so glib?

37:01.280 --> 37:05.080
Gloria, the patient wants to stay
here, his doctor agrees with him.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.240
       For whatever reason.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.360
That should be the end
of the discussion.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.480
I know, in a normal circumstance,
you'd respect that.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.200
But you're putting PR
before patient care.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.480
I listened to what
the Colonel had to say!

37:14.480 --> 37:18.040
          Did you really?

37:18.040 --> 37:20.120
Knowing you was supposed
to make this easier -

37:20.120 --> 37:21.280
that's why they sent me.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.640
I'm very sorry, but Dr Morrison feels
that it's in Cochrane's best interest

37:24.640 --> 37:26.440
that he remain here and I'm
gonna stand by that decision.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.920
that he remain here and I'm
gonna stand by that decision.
Are you serious?

37:27.920 --> 37:31.240
Morrison is just blowing smoke
  to cover Cochrane's tail.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.960
Both times you've
come to this hospital,

37:32.960 --> 37:34.720
I've never seen you
function as a doctor.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.600
And frankly,
for all intents and purposes,

37:37.600 --> 37:39.320
I don't think you are one any more.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.880
Why are you dumping on me
    for doing my job?

37:41.880 --> 37:44.320
Because you're letting yourself
be swallowed up in that system!

37:44.320 --> 37:45.360
    And you don't even know it!

37:45.360 --> 37:48.840
The system sent me around the world!
Educated me in a dozen schools,

37:48.840 --> 37:51.720
let me travel through more
   countries than I can count!

37:51.720 --> 37:55.720
Then why is it
you know so little about people?

38:01.720 --> 38:05.720
Well, I guess this means we
won't be sleeping together tonight.

38:07.040 --> 38:11.040
It's been great
    seeing you again, Donald.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.760
This place is exactly the same.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.600
BABY CRIES

38:30.600 --> 38:34.040
Ellen!

38:34.040 --> 38:38.040
Dam neighbourhood cats,
they're at it again!

38:39.680 --> 38:43.680
CRYING CONTINUES

38:44.560 --> 38:48.560
I said to watch your head
    when you got up.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.760
Now then, little one.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.760
Oh-ho, you are wet,
       young lady! Yeah.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.480
I'll bet a little hungry too, huh?

38:59.480 --> 39:02.680
Well, that's OK.
    Papa'll take care of that.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.120
Do you always get up in the middle
of the night with Barbara?

39:06.120 --> 39:08.840
Usually.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.800
Wife's had her all day.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.800
So I thought I'd give
      Patti a little rest.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.480
Besides, gives me a little
more time with Barbara.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.680
There you go!

39:24.680 --> 39:27.240
OK. Would you heat up
a bottle out of the fridge?

39:27.240 --> 39:31.240
There's a pan of water
     over there on the stove.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.560
You don't want to boil it!

39:39.560 --> 39:43.560
You don't want to boil it!
No kidding.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.360
Let me ask you a question.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.440
How did you raise three kids
   in this sardine can?

39:58.440 --> 39:59.840
Well, we had a house.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.840
My father built it on a piece of
land. It's still up the road aways.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.960
A lot of love and care
went into that home.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.120
Why would you move?

40:09.120 --> 40:12.000
We sold it so the kids could go
 to a decent college.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
It's not right that they have
to start off life on their own
  with college loans.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.160
I tried to help my kids
   the way my father taught me.

40:22.160 --> 40:26.160
He came from Hungary in the early
1900s without a cent to his name.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.160
He was lucky he got a job
sorting mail on a train

40:31.080 --> 40:33.160
out of New York City to Buffalo.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.920
Ran right through Clinton here.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.680
It was dad's dream to buy
    a little piece of land,

40:37.680 --> 40:40.720
get us kids out of the city
   and up here.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.160
He wanted the best for his kids.

40:43.160 --> 40:46.040
And that's what I want for mine.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.320
It cost you your father's dream.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.320
Well, sometimes to get ahead
you got to take three steps forward

40:52.360 --> 40:53.960
and one step back.  Hmm.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.360
Where are your sons now?

40:55.360 --> 40:59.360
Les is with Hewlett-Packard.
Good with computers.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.760
And Gene Junior, he's a civil
engineer down in Connecticut.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.480
You should be proud.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.400
They're good boys.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.040
I meant of yourself.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.040
Barbara's bottle must be ready now.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.040
Mark, I want to thank you
for what you're doing for Vonnie.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.480
I watched you at the hospital today.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.840
You treat her as if
    she were one of your own.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.560
She's a part of my family.

41:26.560 --> 41:30.120
About what you said about Steve...

41:30.120 --> 41:31.920
Stephen came to trust you.

41:31.920 --> 41:35.600
Now I know why.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.360
Here we go, Barbara.  Oh, your turn.

41:38.360 --> 41:42.360
Go on there, little one.
There you go.

41:48.920 --> 41:52.920
There you go. Yes.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.160
      So it's settled, then.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.160
A week from now, you and I will
be vacationing in Barbados.  Mmmm.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.360
Sounds good.

42:11.360 --> 42:15.360
Romantic and hot, sultry...

42:15.680 --> 42:19.240
    Just like I like my women!

42:19.240 --> 42:23.240
If I wasn't so tired,
 I'd bury my fist in your chest!

42:25.000 --> 42:27.560
I'm gonna close my eyes a minute.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.000
Keep talking.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.960
          You just relax.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.960
Feels nice to sit here
with my arms around you.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.960
I just can't stop
thinking about babies.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.320
         Little fat faces.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.320
Some person walking
around that you made.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.240
  That loves you unconditionally.

42:54.240 --> 42:58.040
Looks to you for
everything in its life.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.720
Too bad they can't change
    their own diapers.

43:01.720 --> 43:03.800
             Diapers?

43:03.800 --> 43:06.160
 That's the least important part.

43:06.160 --> 43:10.160
Not if you're the one
doing the changing.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.360
            Hmm. I am.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.560
            I love you.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.920
Welcome back.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.000
     What are you doing here?

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
I couldn't wait for you to come.
I was too excited.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.560
Where's Barbara?

43:55.560 --> 43:58.320
In the nursery?

43:58.320 --> 44:02.320
                No.

44:03.960 --> 44:07.960
She isn't with you.

44:11.120 --> 44:15.120
I hate you for this, Mark.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.720
   You're nice, Dr Auschlander.

44:29.720 --> 44:33.400
You're the father
I'm not sure I ever had!

44:33.400 --> 44:36.120
I really appreciate you
taking me out for this walk.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.960
Nothing like the morning air
and a good night's sleep
   to clear one's head.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.600
   Back to being John Doe No. 6.

44:41.600 --> 44:45.040
I never could have been Mary Richards
anyway. I haven't got spunk.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.160
           I hate spunk!

44:48.160 --> 44:50.320
Some day you'll find out
     who you are.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.600
Without the distraction
of television.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.400
Well, I thought, you know, having
someone else's identity was better

44:56.400 --> 45:00.400
  than having no identity at all.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.640
You know, at night, I lie
in my bed in the psych ward

45:04.640 --> 45:07.600
and I hear names being paged
over the PA and I'm thinking,

45:07.600 --> 45:10.240
"What if I'm being called
and I don't even know it?"

45:10.240 --> 45:12.120
 There is nothing more terrifying

45:12.120 --> 45:14.800
than not knowing who you are,
Dr Auschlander.

45:14.800 --> 45:18.800
You've got a lot of friends
who want to help you.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
  I'm going to make it after all!

45:50.920 --> 45:59.000
