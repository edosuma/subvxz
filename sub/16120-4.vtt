WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:04.563
* Suddenly
the clouds have opened up *

00:04.600 --> 00:09.105
* And I'm being seen
in all of my glory *

00:09.140 --> 00:13.099
* The time has_come
for fate to deCIde *

00:13.140 --> 00:16.246
* If a part of me
is even worthy *

00:16.280 --> 00:20.376
* The air is warm,
my heart is cold *

00:20.420 --> 00:24.379
* And I'll_ never know
how It feels *

00:24.420 --> 00:28.550
* The air is warm,
my heart is cold *

00:28.590 --> 00:30.251
* And I'll never know...

00:30.290 --> 00:32.053
Sorry for the wait,
Mr. Bordelon.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.149
Oh, no.
No problem.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.165
Sign here.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.839
Initial here,
here, and here.

00:42.870 --> 00:46.101
- And don't forget the date.
- All right.

00:54.380 --> 00:56.280
Here you go.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.208
It might take two or three
business days to process,

00:58.250 --> 01:00.150
but now you got access
to the $100,000

01:00.190 --> 01:01.782
your sister deposited
in the farm account.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.152
The debit cards
for Nova Bordelon
and Charley Bordelon-West

01:04.190 --> 01:05.623
will be mailed out
to you.

01:05.660 --> 01:08.823
Your sister already...

01:08.860 --> 01:10.418
completed the sole
proprietor forms.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.688
She even set up the tax ID
and filled out the DBA.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.163
She's pretty
on top of it.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.737
Charley's
somethin' else.

01:17.770 --> 01:21.103
( mutters )

01:21.140 --> 01:22.448
Hey, Ralph Angel!

01:22.480 --> 01:24.641
- Hey, ain't nothin'.
- What's up?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.113
Man, you in the
flower business now?

01:26.150 --> 01:28.311
Oh, man,
this is for Miss April.

01:28.350 --> 01:31.217
- What?
- I ain't paid not one
overdraft fee in years.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.753
- I like that.
- Charley still in L.A.?

01:33.790 --> 01:36.452
Yeah, she got me
handlin' the farm.

01:36.490 --> 01:39.891
She left you in charge?
I didn't mean disrespect.

01:39.930 --> 01:43.229
She just had me
look into some farm managers
while she was gone

01:43.270 --> 01:44.897
and everybody's all booked up
this late in the season.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.330
Well, I guess
it's on me then, ain't it?

01:47.370 --> 01:49.531
- All right.
- I'm buying seed cane
from the Ag Station today.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.902
Oh, that's good.
That means you guys
already got the farm

01:51.940 --> 01:54.135
registered
with the state.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.148
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.341
Hey. If the Ag
is sold out,

01:58.380 --> 02:01.349
I can call over to LSU,
check on their supply.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.416
I got it, Remy,
I appreciate it.

02:03.450 --> 02:06.578
Remy:
Okay. Hey, just holler
if you need anything.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.254
( phone beeps,
line rings )

02:13.300 --> 02:16.224
- Hey.
- Hey, Charley,
what's goin' on?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.397
Just running errands.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.694
The bank called,
said you're all set up.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.503
They don't waste
no time, huh?

02:22.540 --> 02:24.303
I was calling
to tell you that.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.228
So, you're buying
seed cane now?

02:26.280 --> 02:29.670
Uh, soon.
Goin' to work,
then I gotta grab Blue.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.905
But I'm buying it today,
don't worry about that.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.771
Okay, but before
you spend a dime,

02:34.820 --> 02:37.516
make sure you ask about
the different cane varieties.

02:37.550 --> 02:40.314
Yeah, I-I'll ask.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.658
Ralph Angel, you'd tell me
if this was too much,

02:42.690 --> 02:45.284
right?

02:45.330 --> 02:48.788
I-- I need this
to go smoothly.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.718
I know.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.738
It will, I promise.

02:52.770 --> 02:56.706
Hey, I gotta go.
I'ma talk to you later,
all right?

02:56.740 --> 02:57.707
( beeps )

03:27.340 --> 03:29.262
( knocking on door)

03:32.280 --> 03:34.578
So, what brings you
in today, Mrs. West?

03:34.610 --> 03:36.976
Um, you just had your last
Pap smear six months ago.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.319
I know.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.648
But I need you
to test for everything.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.786
Okay.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.885
( theme music playing )

03:51.930 --> 03:56.321
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

03:56.370 --> 03:59.794
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

03:59.840 --> 04:02.559
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight *

04:04.410 --> 04:06.378
Dreams never die *

04:11.680 --> 04:15.468
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

04:15.520 --> 04:19.354
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight. *

04:19.390 --> 04:22.382
Yeah, I say that we focus
our efforts on Nike
and McDonald's

04:22.430 --> 04:24.352
before they drop
Davis's ad.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.823
If TAG Heuer wants out,
let them go.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.498
That's not
your call, MIrIam.

04:27.530 --> 04:30.363
We want luxury.
Mercedes Benz,
Calvin Klein...

04:30.400 --> 04:33.767
We didn't work for_ all these
years for DaVIs to just hawk
fast food and sneakers.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.360
- Let's give it some more time--
- Call Jochen at Rolex.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.799
Tell them Davis
wants to sever with TAG.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.799
Suggest five over five years
instead of TAG's five over two.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.384
"GQ" is likely to drop Davis
from their "_Men of the Year"
Issue.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.049
Look, I can make a call.
Our PR firms have worked
together in the past.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.456
Don't.
This is actually
for the better.

04:56.490 --> 04:59.459
A "GQ" spread
would reinforce
some playboy image.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.526
Nathan, have any of the other
players spoken to the press
since the suspension?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.390
I haven't been able
to get ahold of the Wives.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.967
Word is that
they have teamed up.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.731
Mounting a joint defense
to repeal the league's
decision.

05:10.770 --> 05:13.409
Without_ us.
Interesting.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.978
I can reach out to Coach Ross
and Andrew, have them make a
public statement--

05:17.010 --> 05:20.719
No need. Davis and I
are meeting with them
this afternoon.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.689
Charley, look...

05:24.720 --> 05:28.417
_ I know that this
IS personal for you,
but I am Davis's agent--

05:28.460 --> 05:30.985
This is personal.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.726
I built
those relationships.

05:35.530 --> 05:36.895
That's all for now.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.091
Nathan,
follow up with Cliff
at Mercedes Benz,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.768
and Miriam?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.904
We'll talk later.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.898
Okay.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.845
( line rings )

05:55.880 --> 05:57.711
- Hey, Nova.
- Hey.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.718
Did you get my messages?

05:59.760 --> 06:03.127
Yes, I got your messages.
But I'm not spying on Rah
for you, Charley.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.627
It's not spying.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.890
Ralph Angel was
supposed to call and
reserve the seed cane.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.125
He's buying it today.
I just need you
to check in on him.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.493
That task don't
need no hand holdin'
and you know it.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.496
Plus, I told y'all,
the farm was your project--

06:14.540 --> 06:18.135
No, no, what you said
was you would commit to it
for the season--

06:18.170 --> 06:20.604
And I meant it.
But I'm on a story.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.608
Charley:
Wait, I thought you were
taking time off from work?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.470
We all gotta get back
to livin', Charley.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.819
Listen,
you put Rah in charge,
so let him handle it,

06:26.850 --> 06:30.479
or you can come back
to St. Jo and look over
his shoulder yourself, okay?

06:30.520 --> 06:33.387
IfI could be there,
I would.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.478
( sighs )

06:36.530 --> 06:39.749
I'll do what I can.
But I ain't on no hook.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.688
Thank you.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.529
Davis:
Hey.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.579
I was afraid you and Micah
were never coming back.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.042
Charley, baby...

07:01.080 --> 07:03.947
What's her name?

07:03.990 --> 07:06.208
- Who?
- The prostitute.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.287
What's her name,
Davis?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.527
She goes by "Goldie."

07:16.570 --> 07:18.925
"Goldie"?

07:18.970 --> 07:22.462
So, you have me out here
looking crazy over a ho
named Goldie?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.933
Baby, I messed up.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.528
I messed up.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.469
Charley,
I don't know
what to do.

07:29.510 --> 07:31.569
The car is here
to take me to school.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.148
- I can go by myself.
- No, no, baby,
I'll go with you.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.717
Just give me a minute.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.258
I'll do my job
as your manager,

07:46.290 --> 07:49.453
but don't expect me
to play the dutiful wife
holding your hand.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.498
( sizzling, crackling )

07:58.540 --> 08:01.008
- ( music playing )
- ( snaps fingers )

08:03.080 --> 08:07.847
So, you give any thought
to pushing your schedule?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.280
Do you hear that?

08:10.320 --> 08:12.618
- What? I don't hear nothin'.
- Exactly.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.254
'Cause ain't nobody
in this house

08:15.290 --> 08:17.850
except for me and you.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.596
( laughing )

08:19.630 --> 08:22.895
Just ask if you can
go back next week.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.625
Chre,

08:24.670 --> 08:26.763
I can't be pushin'
my schedule around.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.735
I took time off
for the funeral.

08:29.770 --> 08:34.207
If I take any more
time off I'm gonna
have to find me a new job.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.606
Well, you could...

08:36.650 --> 08:37.742
work the farm
with Ralph Angel.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.772
- ( chuckles )
- No, you could.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.288
Come on, Baton Rouge
don't need you.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.289
Baby,
it's only two weeks,
all right?

08:46.320 --> 08:49.756
Now, what about my
goin'-away dinner?

08:49.790 --> 08:52.020
You know,
your pie is so good,

08:52.060 --> 08:55.689
it make my toes curl.

08:55.730 --> 08:59.222
But that_ain't
the only thing that
make my toes curl.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.636
( moans )

09:01.670 --> 09:04.559
- You right.
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.636
We got so much work
to do around here

09:07.680 --> 09:10.308
- 'fore you got to leave.
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.773
So, I tell you what,
why don't you...

09:12.820 --> 09:15.709
clean all this up.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.083
And I'ma go get...
dressed for work.

09:20.990 --> 09:23.584
Now, wait a minute.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.325
Vi?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.191
Vi?

09:27.230 --> 09:28.993
Girl, you play too much.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.588
( phone chimes )

09:33.640 --> 09:35.665
Are you still texting
with Stella?

09:35.700 --> 09:39.704
You're gonna see her
in five seconds.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.674
- What is so important--
- Mom! Stop!

09:41.710 --> 09:43.678
Well, what are you texting?
It must be really important.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.713
- It was very important.
- Oh, okay.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.718
- Wait, Micah.
- Yeah?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.843
Your dad and I, we...

09:52.290 --> 09:54.349
we wanted...

09:54.390 --> 09:57.257
Are you guys
getting a divorce?

09:59.330 --> 10:02.219
I don't know.

10:02.260 --> 10:05.798
But I want you
to prepare yourself.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.761
You're gonna hear
some things--

10:10.810 --> 10:13.108
online, the news,
just out there--

10:13.140 --> 10:14.778
ugly things about him.

10:14.810 --> 10:16.277
That stuff
doesn't matter to me.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.403
But it matters.

10:18.450 --> 10:21.271
Don't let
the houses or the_ cars
or the way we live

10:21.320 --> 10:23.845
have you thinking
otherwise, Micah.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.712
Society's quick
to demonize men
like your father.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.250
Black men?

10:29.290 --> 10:31.679
Yes, Micah. Black men.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.820
I just want you
to be careful, okay?

10:40.070 --> 10:42.732
- Woman: Micah! Micah!
- Micah: Thanks.

10:42.770 --> 10:44.931
You call me
if you need to, okay?

10:44.970 --> 10:46.437
Okay.

10:46.470 --> 10:49.075
- I'm good.
- Woman: Micah! Micah! Micah!

10:49.110 --> 10:50.407
Man:
Yo, Micah!

10:50.450 --> 10:52.406
Photographers:
Micah, right here!

10:52.450 --> 10:54.771
Mom, I just--

10:54.820 --> 10:56.117
( squeals )

10:57.920 --> 11:00.684
- ( squeals )
- I missed you.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.780
- I missed you.
- Micah: I missed you more.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.082
( photographers shouting )

11:06.130 --> 11:07.791
Just--

11:13.070 --> 11:15.334
( rattles, squeaks )

11:20.110 --> 11:23.773
15 to 30 for carrying
an 8-ball, ya heard me?

11:23.810 --> 11:26.347
I coulda killed somebody
and got less time.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.213
Crazy thing is,
I ain't even had
that much weight on me,

11:29.250 --> 11:31.787
but they said I did,
and since I got priors,

11:31.820 --> 11:35.358
ADA say if I take the plea
I'm looking at eight years.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.982
Three on good behavior.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.453
I wasn't trying to take
none of that, you heard me?

11:39.490 --> 11:42.391
But then they set my behind
in that cell for a whole year--

11:42.430 --> 11:44.318
When did you go
to NOLA Parish Jail?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.838
Them people
ain't waste no time,
it was right away.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.792
I was 17 when I went.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.809
They put me in max
and there wasn't no bail.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.479
They got me
on probation hold.

11:54.510 --> 11:57.047
Man, after sitting in there,
a year, I just took the plea.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.814
That life tough,
you hear me?

12:00.850 --> 12:03.512
You got cellies
putting their hands on you.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.518
I mean, they can
throw you in isolation,

12:05.550 --> 12:09.828
but then have the C05
hold your meals.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.851
Man, I ain't never
even wanna think on it.

12:11.890 --> 12:16.259
Truth is,
I don't wanna talk
about my situation.

12:18.870 --> 12:22.909
My brother did time, too,
I know it's hard.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.828
- Yeah?
- ( phone buzzes )

12:24.870 --> 12:28.271
- Give me a minute, hear?
- All right, no problem.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.348
( phone beeps,
line rings )

12:37.420 --> 12:39.911
Hey, Calvin.
I'm working.
What's up?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.383
Your friend's kid brother,
the one in lockup.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.388
Too Sweet, yes.
What about him?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.921
He's in
County Medical.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.996
He got hurt
real bad.

12:49.030 --> 12:50.566
Oh, no.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.966
I just thought
you'd wanna know.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.259
Any chance you could
meet me at the hospital?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.063
In about an hour?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.569
Why isn't Too Sweet
at the Orleans Inﬁrmary?

13:02.610 --> 13:05.443
There's overcrowding.
They send low security
inmates here.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.916
This is
a closed-off area,
only guards have access.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.089
Anybody say
what happened?

13:11.120 --> 13:15.181
- The OC said he fell.
- You can't possibly
believe that.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.158
You gonna be okay?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.929
* Let me give it
a moment *

13:34.940 --> 13:37.204
* Oh-oh-oh-hh

13:38.950 --> 13:41.942
* Just to sink in

13:44.490 --> 13:47.357
* Just to sink in

13:52.290 --> 13:56.863
* 'Cause I really pushed
the boat out *

13:56.900 --> 14:00.961
* This time

14:01.000 --> 14:04.265
* Now I'm sinkin'...

14:04.310 --> 14:07.006
* Fast

14:07.040 --> 14:08.598
* Now I'm sinkin'...

14:08.640 --> 14:10.870
* Down...

14:14.980 --> 14:17.517
In You, Lord,
I have taken refuge.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.950
Let me never be
put to shame.

14:19.990 --> 14:24.359
Keep me free from the trap
that is set for me.

14:24.390 --> 14:26.950
Therefore
You are my refuge.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.266
Into Your hands,
I commit my spirit.

14:31.300 --> 14:35.930
Deliver me, Lord,
Thy faithful God.

14:40.540 --> 14:43.976
* Let me give it
a second *

14:44.010 --> 14:48.379
* A second

14:48.420 --> 14:51.878
* Bite of the cherry

14:54.060 --> 14:57.029
* Bite of the cherry

15:01.960 --> 15:04.929
- ( clicks )
- * 'Cause I really
pushed you away *

15:04.970 --> 15:08.189
* Away, away.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.548
- Hey, slow down, man.
- Hey.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.342
You acting like you
like this job.

15:26.390 --> 15:29.587
My bad, Melvin.
Just want to get these
pallets unloaded.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.180
If I finish this,
Earl might let me
duck out early.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.619
- What you gotta do?
- Buy some seed cane.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.423
You farm?

15:36.460 --> 15:40.294
Yeah. My pops
just left me and
my sisters some land.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.968
- He just passed away.
- Oh, shit, man.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.069
- Hey, I'm sorry
for your loss.
- It's all good.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.206
Hey, you know,
my cousin farms, too.
Sugar cane, out in Jackson.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.572
They 'bout to shut it down.
They can't afford
the upkeep.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.714
He's selling and
giving away everything.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.378
Hey, look, look.
Why don't you roll out,
man? I got this.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.741
- Word?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.382
Won't take
but a few hours.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.217
Look, man,
it's nothin'.
I got It.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.081
- Ah, man. Holler at ya.
- All right.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.219
Our hands are tied
on this.

16:08.260 --> 16:12.492
It's just a
statement, Andrew.

16:12.530 --> 16:16.739
I hate to say it,
but with all the player
misconduct going on,

16:16.770 --> 16:19.603
I'm not surprised
at the league's decision.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.246
And frankly, Charley,
your meltdown on the court

16:23.280 --> 16:25.077
only brought us
more attention.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.668
Andrew...

16:26.710 --> 16:27.745
careful.

16:27.780 --> 16:31.511
An indefinite suspension
is a flat-out overreach.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.011
What are you even
talking about here?

16:36.060 --> 16:38.085
We're talking
about rape.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.496
I didn't rape anyone.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.261
Without the presence
of legal counsel,

16:44.300 --> 16:46.461
let's be mindful
of that word.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.361
Believe me,
the team is on your side.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.528
We simply have to see
where the chips fall.

16:58.080 --> 17:02.176
That's not
good enough.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.778
I need to get
to a meeting.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.038
Excuse me.

17:09.620 --> 17:13.590
Thank you...
for having my back.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.689
I got physical therapy
now, but maybe later

17:15.730 --> 17:19.791
me you and Micah
can do something
nice for dinner.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.695
Charley.

17:26.370 --> 17:28.201
I'll see you back
at the house.

17:28.240 --> 17:33.416
I just need to know
I have your support.
The team's support.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.840
Charley, I can't
go around the league
just for Davis.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.609
How many times...

17:38.650 --> 17:40.811
have we gone
to the mat for you?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.351
Covered for you.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.699
Do I_ need
to remind you,

17:47.730 --> 17:51.860
you wouldn't even have
your job if it wasn't
for Davis and me.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.232
The team's trying
to create distance.

17:54.270 --> 17:57.569
Davis is
an expensive liability
and he's getting old.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.498
There's talk about
backing Felix and Eddie--

17:59.540 --> 18:02.179
an all-star and _
a number-one draft pick.

18:02.210 --> 18:05.179
They're obvious choices.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.179
We heard rumors
of a rape kit,

18:08.220 --> 18:11.189
and if Davis
is charged...

18:11.220 --> 18:14.485
it's just best
to create distance.
I'm sorry, Charley.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.626
We will _sue.
We Will.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.536
The Warriors are not gonna
pick up Felix Evans, man.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.367
What about
the Sixers?

18:31.410 --> 18:35.130
I would retire tomorrow
ifI had to play
for the Sixers.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.148
Retire from what career?
( laughs )

18:37.180 --> 18:39.273
Hey, Micah, you think
your dad's getting traded?

18:39.310 --> 18:41.642
- I can't say.
- Dude, this whole thing
is gonna blow over.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.216
Hey!

18:43.250 --> 18:45.241
What'd I miss?

18:45.290 --> 18:48.384
Um, Stella,
have you told Micah
about the new Tumblr page?

18:48.420 --> 18:51.218
What Tumblr page?

18:51.260 --> 18:52.887
Come on, tell him.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.557
It's dumb.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.160
Just some stupid haters
talking smack.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.293
- No one cares.
- I care.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.230
- ( phone chimes )
- ( sighs )

19:01.270 --> 19:03.807
Mom has been
so "extra" lately.
I gotta go.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.831
I'll see you at my house
later though, okay?

19:05.870 --> 19:07.838
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.544
- Aw-ww.
-(laughs)

19:15.680 --> 19:17.409
There's just
not enough story here.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.384
George, I need
to run this tonight.

19:19.420 --> 19:21.581
I know this kid.
Too Sweet's a minor

19:21.620 --> 19:23.850
being held
in an adult prison.

19:23.890 --> 19:25.858
He had one joint on him
and he's being forced
to take a plea

19:25.890 --> 19:27.790
on a possession
and resisting charge.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.422
If a white kid
from Lakeview got
picked up for a joint,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.462
he'd pay a fine
and get counseling.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.536
Yes, blacks are treated
like shit, but that
still doesn't mean that--

19:33.570 --> 19:35.390
( phone ringing )

19:35.440 --> 19:37.931
- ( sighs )
- Sorry, it's my sister.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.530
Family issue.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.730
Nova, I okayed
your plea deal story

19:42.780 --> 19:46.307
hopin' you'd
take some time off
to properly grieve.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.942
Give me more cases,
maybe we'll talk.

19:47.980 --> 19:51.279
Jermaine LaRue, 15.
Passenger of a stolen
vehicle.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.550
Plead guilty
to grand theft.
Sentenced to 13 years.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.808
Latrenda Glace, 16.
Caught loitering.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.556
Plead guilty
to resisting arrest.
Four years probation.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.729
Victor Brule, 16,
a school fight.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.297
Plead guilty
to assault and resisting,
served three years--

20:03.330 --> 20:06.424
- All right, all right!
- All of these cases
are excesswe charges.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.894
All black,
all minors.

20:09.940 --> 20:14.206
The police and ADA
are coercing people
into taking plea deals.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.302
- Sources?
- One-on-one's,

20:18.350 --> 20:20.318
case files,
and I'm meeting with
the DA this afternoon.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.238
With my contacts
at the courthouse,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.987
I'll only need
a few more names.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.909
You know my daddy
was a sheriff back in
Tupelo, Mississippi?

20:27.960 --> 20:32.659
And my mama was a voodoo
priestess from the bayous
of Louisiana.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.590
There's gonna be
serious backlash.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.360
I'm not backin' away
from this story.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.035
Good.
Better than good.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.868
You think I like
that gossipy shit
the paper's been askin' for?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.332
Hell, no.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.578
This-- this
is what we do.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.774
I'll have copy for you
by midnight.

20:58.690 --> 20:59.918
Hey.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.918
Nova Bordelon,
"News Orleans Daily News."

21:01.960 --> 21:03.928
We spoke earlier.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.527
Yes, your
appointment's here,

21:07.560 --> 21:09.619
but the DA's been out
in meetings all day.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.969
Any idea when
she'll be back?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.935
That wasn't_rhetorical.
Can you find out?

21:14.970 --> 21:16.699
( scoffs )

21:18.810 --> 21:21.301
- Hi, I have
a reporter here...
- ( phone rings )

21:21.340 --> 21:22.830
What is it?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.384
Hold up,
hold up, hold up.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.309
- Wait up, sir.
- I've closed for the night.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.658
I got money
and my truck's
right over there.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.453
I just need to buy
some seed cane.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.856
Whoo. You late to be puttin'
seed cane in the ground.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.791
- I know, I know.
- How much you farmin'?

21:42.830 --> 21:45.822
We got 800 acres,
but we're farmin' 300
this season.

21:45.870 --> 21:48.088
- And what's your parish?
- St. Jo.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.007
( sighs )
All right.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.431
( grunts )

21:56.740 --> 22:00.346
Let's see, St. Jo.,
St. Jo., St. Jo...

22:03.750 --> 22:05.718
That parish
is sold out.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.810
No, no, no, no.
You-- you gotta
look again.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.351
( sighs )
All the farms
that are registered

22:11.390 --> 22:13.119
for the base acreage
in Louisiana

22:13.160 --> 22:17.119
they got all their stock.
You gotta order in advance.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.560
How was I supposed
to know that?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.465
Hey, you're the one
with the farm.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.559
Sir, no, I--
listen.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.135
I'll pay double.
I really need this, sir.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.876
Don't lock up.
Don't lock up.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.969
Ain't nothin'
I can do, Sir.

22:30.010 --> 22:33.639
Ain't nothin' you can do?
Can't we work somethin' out?

22:35.550 --> 22:37.745
So, you just
gonna walk off?

22:39.620 --> 22:43.010
( phone ringing )

22:45.530 --> 22:48.124
- You avoidin' my calls now?
- No, I'm just busy, Nova.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.027
Everybody's busy.
Charley's been blowin' me up
all day about seed cane.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.398
( softly)
Did you even buy it?

22:54.440 --> 22:58.501
Rah? You didn't, did you?
See, this is exactly what--

22:58.540 --> 23:00.030
What about you, huh?

23:00.070 --> 23:02.504
I get it.
Charley got
her thing in LA,

23:02.540 --> 23:05.509
but you live here.
What's your excuse?

23:05.550 --> 23:08.474
My excuse?
I got a kid picked up
on charges in ICU--

23:08.520 --> 23:09.771
There's always some kid.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.709
Some story,
some hood crisis.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.522
You know
what's messed up?

23:17.560 --> 23:22.156
You care more about
them brothers locked up
than your own brother.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.068
You came to visit me,
what, twice, while
I was inside?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.067
How many times
you seen this kid?

23:29.100 --> 23:30.704
Rah, I--

23:30.740 --> 23:33.504
Nah, Nova, you go ahead
and do you like you
always do.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.007
I gotta go.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.459
Woman:
We can start by
renegotiating his contract.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.650
- Can we please?
- ( laughing )

23:49.690 --> 23:51.180
- You are amazing.
- Thank you.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.084
Your husband would be
in very good hands with me.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.950
I'm sure of that.
That's why we're here.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.729
You need to
start thinking about
sponsorship opportunities--

23:56.760 --> 24:00.196
Hey, Lena.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.788
Miriam.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.104
Charley.
Girl, I didn't know
you were back in town.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.473
Well, I'm sure
_ I mentioned it
in my v0icemails.

24:07.510 --> 24:11.071
Been meaning
to hit you back.
You know how crazy it's been.

24:11.110 --> 24:13.146
No, of course.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.216
I didn't know
you two were friends.

24:15.250 --> 24:19.141
LA. is a small town.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.120
I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.696
Pull-- pull up a chair,
join us.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.563
You know,
that is so sweet,
but I really cant.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.761
Lunch is on me.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.961
Oh, Charley,
you don't have to
do that.

24:38.010 --> 24:42.731
Girl, I haven't
seen you in so long, it is
the least I can do.

24:49.650 --> 24:52.483
( water sprays, stops )

24:56.660 --> 24:59.481
That's a pretty classy move,
picking up the tab.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.861
So, what are we
dealing with?

25:05.900 --> 25:08.198
Felix and Eddie are
mounting a joint defense.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.731
They're gonna try
to settle without Davis.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.603
They're even talking
to Estelle Peterson

25:13.640 --> 25:16.609
the high-profile attorney
who handled the Parker
NFL assault case.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.677
I'm familiar.

25:19.710 --> 25:21.541
I'll call you
when I need you.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.141
Hi, sorry I'm late.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.215
I just found out
about this meeting.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.151
( softly)
I thought we already had
a criminal attorney.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.999
I fired him.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.638
It's a pleasure.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.069
Please sit.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.631
I was just
telling your wife
that the detectives

25:46.670 --> 25:49.230
have been tight-lipped
about the details
of your case,

25:49.280 --> 25:52.772
which is fine.
They have yet to provide
any sufficient evidence.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.677
So, silence
indemnifies them.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.712
But you--
you should be ready.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.116
Assuming that there
is a rape kit,

26:01.160 --> 26:03.822
and any
damning evidence,

26:03.860 --> 26:06.829
the prosecutors
could have a solid case.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.669
What _are
our options?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.668
I want_ to handle this
in a way

26:13.700 --> 26:16.828
that gets you exactly
what you're looking for.

26:16.870 --> 26:20.931
You have options,
and I'm not talking
settlement.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.279
My P.I. has been
tracking Melina Gold.

26:24.310 --> 26:27.006
_ Her real name
is Melina Galoudian.

26:27.050 --> 26:30.247
She's 26 years old
_ and she lives
in Houston, Texas.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.816
It won't take much
to discredit a call girl
with priors

26:34.860 --> 26:37.624
who offers group sex
on her agency's site.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.827
But, on occasion,

26:41.860 --> 26:44.863
I have clients
who use backchannels...

26:44.900 --> 26:48.666
to make cases
like this disappear.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.969
Melin_a's
a prostitute.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.103
- She's gotta have a price.
- No. No.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.608
- Charley, we're leaving.
- Davis--

27:04.690 --> 27:08.649
Find out
how much it'll cost
to make this go away.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.864
About to hit
this break.
You smoke?

27:21.900 --> 27:25.734
Nah. Thanks
for letting me
dip earlier.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.306
Ain't
no thing, wodie.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.979
Hey, you got
your seed cane?

27:31.850 --> 27:33.408
All sold out.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.441
Ah-hh...

27:35.480 --> 27:37.880
You know,
I was thinking
about your cousin,

27:37.920 --> 27:39.911
- the one up in Jackson?
- Mm-hmm.

27:39.950 --> 27:43.056
You, uh... mind
hittin' him up?

27:43.090 --> 27:46.287
Since he's offloadin'
his farm, maybe he got
some seed cane I can buy.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.218
Yeah, yeah,
I'll give him a call.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.955
I mean, he ain't
got but 70 acres,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.195
but probably still
cut you a deal though.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.937
Aw, no,
I appreciate that.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.892
We cover each other
around here.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.931
- I'll see you out there.
- All right.

28:08.950 --> 28:10.713
"Nola Daily News"

28:10.750 --> 28:12.479
start printing
the truth yet?

28:12.520 --> 28:16.081
_ Your issue
is With the paper,
not with me, Francine.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.350
You and
the American Civil
Liberties Union,

28:18.390 --> 28:19.948
y'all can sue
anyone y'all want.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.857
My organization helps
the disenfranchised,

28:22.900 --> 28:24.367
yours is part
of the problem.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.789
I ain't come here
to fight.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.697
I wouldn't have called
it if wasn't important.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.972
I hear the ACLU
is takin' on
the DA's office?

28:39.010 --> 28:41.012
- Somebody has to.
- Well, they're not talkin'.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.938
I got the brush-off
this afternoon.

28:42.980 --> 28:46.347
I could use a little more
background information
on these plea deals.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.756
- What do you have?
_ From What I've gathered,

28:48.790 --> 28:50.826
the number of plea deals
offered by the DA's office

28:50.860 --> 28:52.521
has tripled this year.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.018
Now, these are low-level
offenses and they aggregate
around the Ninth.

28:56.060 --> 28:58.893
They're roundin' these kids up
like it's a circus.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.363
You got the right
bricks, Nova,

29:00.400 --> 29:02.994
but you don't have
the right foundation.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.838
It isn't
about plea deals
or the Ninth.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.873
It's about convictions.

29:08.910 --> 29:12.505
After the FEMA money
dried up, and budget cuts,

29:12.550 --> 29:16.111
whole government departments
got gutted, including NOPD.

29:16.150 --> 29:17.913
Yeah, but everybody knows
there's a deficit.

29:17.950 --> 29:21.158
Yes, but not
the prisons.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.380
Law enforcement...

29:24.430 --> 29:27.183
is financed by money
skimmed off the top

29:27.230 --> 29:29.858
of these
for-profit prisons,

29:29.900 --> 29:31.458
and inmate labor.

29:33.430 --> 29:37.264
Short-term
or long-term sentence,
it doesn't matter,

29:37.300 --> 29:40.804
as long as the bodies
keep coming in.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.075
Inmate count drops,

29:47.110 --> 29:50.887
sheriff's lose money.
DA, prisons, police--

29:50.920 --> 29:53.047
they're all working together,
trading inmates like horses.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.081
Exactly.

29:57.190 --> 30:00.819
If you need 'em,
I got a mountain
dammﬁ.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.291
If I do this right,
my story will change
everything.

30:06.330 --> 30:09.458
( music playing )

30:17.110 --> 30:18.975
Okay...

30:19.010 --> 30:21.513
it's not about you, Micah,
it's about your dad.

30:21.550 --> 30:24.883
Okay, but we're the ones
in those frickin' pictures.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.055
When my parents split,

30:32.090 --> 30:35.457
things got weird.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.991
What does
your mom think?

30:38.030 --> 30:41.193
She has enough
to deal with.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.835
I just wish everyone
would stop talking
about it.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.444
I didn't mean you.

30:58.150 --> 31:01.256
- I didn't mean you!
- ( laughing )

31:10.600 --> 31:12.864
I love you.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.567
Oh, Micah.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.636
Woman:
Stella?

31:20.670 --> 31:23.537
Stella?

31:23.580 --> 31:25.901
Oh, Micah.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.510
IthoughtI
reminded you to, uh,
cancel your study date,

31:28.550 --> 31:31.189
seeing as we have
that dinner tonight.

31:31.220 --> 31:34.053
- What dinner?
- The Foremans' dinner.

31:34.090 --> 31:35.887
That was last week.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.454
Micah, I wish you'd,
uh, checked with me
before you stopped by.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.196
- Mom, he's never checked--
- Stella.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.064
Sorry, yeah.
Um...

31:50.100 --> 31:52.364
I'll take
an Uber home.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.448
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.950
- Hey!
- Hey, boy.

32:10.990 --> 32:14.050
- Man, I appreciate
you comin'.
- Glad you called.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.159
- I got the cane
like I said I would.
- All right.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.498
It's only 70 acres,
but it's a start.

32:18.530 --> 32:20.498
Yo, maybe we could use
some of your connects at LSU,

32:20.530 --> 32:22.634
get the rest to cover
the 230 acres.

32:22.670 --> 32:27.369
Yeah. You check it?
Make sure it's healthy?

32:27.410 --> 32:31.176
I didn't see
nothin' wrong.

32:31.210 --> 32:34.077
( rustling )

32:34.120 --> 32:35.519
Yo, chill.

32:35.550 --> 32:38.610
You gonna ruin it
before we put it
in the ground.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.582
- What?
- ( sighs )

32:42.620 --> 32:45.225
This cane ain't right,
Ralph Angel.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.579
Ain't right?
What you mean?

32:46.630 --> 32:48.222
Farmer I got it from
said it's legit.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.626
Nah, this cane is infected
with smut.

32:50.660 --> 32:54.460
- Smut?
- You see that?
That's fungus.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.331
And that's
just the pieces
that I checked.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.964
It's likely
the whole load.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.771
Yeah, see, this fungus infects
the center of the stalk.

33:10.820 --> 33:14.153
Makes it sallow,
kills it.

33:14.190 --> 33:16.249
Dead cane don't
produce no sugar.

33:17.390 --> 33:21.224
I paid
$15,000 for this.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.626
Can you get
your money back?

33:23.660 --> 33:25.298
No.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.566
( grunts )

33:30.200 --> 33:32.407
What am I
supposed to do?

33:40.310 --> 33:42.346
Want me to put the okra
in the hot water?

33:43.850 --> 33:47.240
Mm-hmm.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.713
"Amending policing laws
would bankrupt

33:49.760 --> 33:55.721
the $182 million
for-profit prison industry.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.389
Inmates, like minor
Devonte Bonclair,
pay the price."

33:59.430 --> 34:02.536
How is this
even legal?

34:02.570 --> 34:05.664
That's the world
we live in.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.077
I mean, we already know
they don't care about us

34:09.110 --> 34:10.338
but it's another thing

34:10.380 --> 34:13.304
to come on
and flat-out say it.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.647
I pray this boy
pulls through.

34:27.330 --> 34:30.754
Ernest would be
very proud of you.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.861
You know, it seems you,
Ralph Angel, and Charley,

34:34.900 --> 34:37.164
y'all are just
goin' on.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.100
Me, one minute
I'm cryin',

34:39.140 --> 34:42.200
the next minute
I'm mad as hell, I...

34:43.610 --> 34:47.740
I don't want Hollywood
to go back to work.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.581
Trust me,
we're not gettin' on.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.214
We're just
gettin' through.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.321
Stella.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.326
Stella...?

35:06.370 --> 35:09.089
Hey! Hey! Hey!

35:10.270 --> 35:12.261
Hey.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.529
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry, I can't
talk right now.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.674
Yeah, you couldn't talk
last night or this morning.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.375
Did I do
something?

35:25.320 --> 35:28.881
Stella?

35:28.920 --> 35:30.785
What is it?

35:38.600 --> 35:42.263
No, I spent months
negotiating that
Mercedes deal.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.359
- Yeah--
- ( line beeping )

35:44.410 --> 35:47.231
Nathan, hold on.
Yeah, I've gotta take this.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.374
It's my kid's school.
Yep.

35:49.410 --> 35:52.277
- ( beeps )
- Hello.

35:52.310 --> 35:55.916
Hi, Mr. Oliver.

35:55.950 --> 35:58.714
What kind of incident?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.383
Okay.

36:02.420 --> 36:04.627
No, I'm--
I'm on my way.

36:06.590 --> 36:09.252
We take this issue
very seriously.

36:09.300 --> 36:14.431
Distribution of this sort
of material is outside
our code of conduct.

36:14.470 --> 36:16.461
It's grounds
for expulsion.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.809
This is ridiculous.
They're kids.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.536
They text
and tweet and Snapchat
all kinds of silliness.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.730
- How about that website?
- What website?

36:23.780 --> 36:26.340
Well, there's a whole
website dedicated to them
because of her husband.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.268
And how is that
Micah's fault?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.845
Mrs. West, we don't
police our students'
personal lives.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.882
But that's exactly
what you're doing.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.615
That picture, it's--

36:34.660 --> 36:37.288
My daughter's
only 15.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.652
So is Micah.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.290
- I wanna see it.
- Mrs. West--

36:46.330 --> 36:48.298
No. Apparently everyone
in this room has seen it.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.900
Now you
wanna expel my son
over a lewd picture

36:50.940 --> 36:53.829
you claim he sent to his
girlfriend? I wanna see
what's in the picture.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.509
You gave birth to him,
I'm sure you've seen it.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.517
Our guidelines
are clear, Mrs. West.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.438
We can't_ make
exceptions.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.711
Micah has to clear out
his locker.

37:06.750 --> 37:10.789
Don't think for one second
we won't fight this.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.320
Charley:
Micah.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.998
Micah.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.361
Stop!

37:19.400 --> 37:21.891
Micah, stop!

37:21.940 --> 37:24.602
You sent that girl
a picture of your--

37:24.640 --> 37:26.767
( whispers )
A picture of your penis?

37:28.680 --> 37:30.671
You better answer me, boy,
or I swear to God,

37:30.710 --> 37:32.405
it's gonna be me and you
all day today.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.475
It wasn't mine.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.044
I didn't send that
to Stella.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.288
I didn't even know
what was in that picture
until he just said it.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.379
Wait, What?

37:41.420 --> 37:44.423
( sobs )

37:44.460 --> 37:46.655
Stella's
cheating on me.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.018
- Baby, I'm so sorry--
- Mom, stop.

37:54.070 --> 37:57.392
I've just been so busy
with your father, baby, I'm--

37:57.440 --> 38:01.308
Micah,
we need to go back in,
sweetheart--

38:01.340 --> 38:02.500
Micah.

38:02.540 --> 38:04.872
Come on, Mom,
let's go!

38:14.420 --> 38:16.911
15,000?

38:16.960 --> 38:19.087
So that's why Ralph Angel's
avoiding my calls?

38:19.130 --> 38:22.395
Remy:
Trust me, Charley.
He feels like hell.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.694
Okay? It was
an honest mistake.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.858
So, you'd make
that mistake?

38:27.900 --> 38:29.663
Well...

38:29.700 --> 38:31.736
Charley:
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.067
( laughing )

38:33.110 --> 38:36.432
You know,
you Bordelons
are a funny bunch.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.347
Okay, I told you
to hire a farm manager.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.075
I already have a job.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.578
Oh, and what
is it again?

38:43.620 --> 38:45.349
Okay, we've been
over this.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.585
I'm a water irrigation
specialist.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.087
Charley:
Oh, right.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.452
Professor...

38:51.490 --> 38:54.459
part-time chef,
I cut hair,

38:54.500 --> 38:56.718
- I do oil changes...
- ( laughing )

38:58.060 --> 39:00.426
Stop.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.961
Oh... you're stupid.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.638
( Remy laughing )

39:04.670 --> 39:07.833
Okay, so,
when are you headed back?

39:07.870 --> 39:09.838
'Cause if you're serious
about this farm,

39:09.880 --> 39:13.702
and I take it that you are,
you can't be double-minded.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.344
You gotta be all-in,
Charley.

39:18.150 --> 39:21.984
Thanks, Remy.
Good night.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.011
'Night, Charley.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.627
( sighs )

39:39.540 --> 39:41.679
There's my boy!

39:43.180 --> 39:46.172
We painted today at school.
I learned 10 new colors.

39:46.210 --> 39:49.145
And I wanna hear all about it.
Go and wash up for dinner,
okay?

39:49.180 --> 39:50.772
Okay.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.083
( door closes )

40:02.600 --> 40:04.522
I'm sorry, Rah.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.561
You were right.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.976
I should have been there
more for you.

40:27.020 --> 40:30.057
I read your article.

40:30.090 --> 40:32.024
It was dope.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.050
I'm gonna be around
more to help.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.193
Mm-hmm.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.959
I'll believe it
when I see it.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.921
Hey!

40:40.970 --> 40:42.858
"When you see it."
Whatever!

40:42.900 --> 40:45.664
- You know exactly
what I mean.
- I'm serious!

40:45.710 --> 40:47.598
- All right.
- I love you.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.868
I love you, too.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.549
Oh, Lord.
The loud Negroes
have returned.

40:51.580 --> 40:54.549
- Hey!
- What up, Wood?

40:54.580 --> 40:56.548
- Hey, my baby.
- How you d0ing?

40:56.580 --> 40:58.719
Hey, buddy.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.615
Now, do I smell
ham hocks?

41:03.660 --> 41:06.220
I guess you ain't
mad at me no more.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.852
Look in the oven.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.122
( laughs )

41:17.070 --> 41:19.732
You know I don't
wanna leave, neither.

41:19.770 --> 41:23.570
Yeah, well,
it is What it is.

41:23.610 --> 41:26.249
Maybe I've been
leanin' on you too much.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.202
Ain't n_othin'
wrong With that.

41:30.680 --> 41:34.889
No, I'm gonna call you.
You gonna call me.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.117
And them days gonna be
gone before we know it.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.525
Mm-hmm.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.051
I'll be all right.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.762
( laughing )

41:51.040 --> 41:53.008
I have news.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.132
Okay.

41:54.170 --> 41:56.877
My P.I. reached out
to Melina Galoudian,

41:56.910 --> 41:59.071
and we offered her
$500,000.

41:59.110 --> 42:02.045
Oh, Christ.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.686
So, that's
the going rate
these days?

42:05.720 --> 42:08.757
Fine.
As long as this
case disappears.

42:08.790 --> 42:10.610
Well, that's just it.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.628
She didn't accept
the payoff.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.924
She doesn't want
the money.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.065
Then What
does she want?

42:32.810 --> 42:35.813
( instrumental music
Playing )
