29:41.458 --> 29:44.500
How long ago
did this happen?

29:44.500 --> 29:46.375
About an hour, I think.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.959
I-I can't remember.

29:48.959 --> 29:50.959
So what'd you call me for?

29:50.959 --> 29:52.917
What do you think?

29:52.917 --> 29:54.583
I want you
to clean this up.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.834
Too fucking risky.

29:59.792 --> 30:03.083
Your 3% of the franchise

30:03.083 --> 30:06.250
won't be worth much
if this were ever made public.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.375
The other owners would not
approve. You know that.

30:08.375 --> 30:09.750
You got a dead body
in your office.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.291
You're thinking
about a fucking deal?

30:11.291 --> 30:13.792
- I can't go to prison.
- People like you rarely do.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.083
I won't spend the rest
of my life

30:15.083 --> 30:17.917
defending myself in court
or in the press.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.000
That chair--

30:27.000 --> 30:28.917
you sat there.

30:30.041 --> 30:33.000
We barely knew each other,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
and you were broken--

30:35.000 --> 30:37.458
nowhere else to turn.

30:37.458 --> 30:38.792
I didn't refuse you, Ray,

30:38.792 --> 30:42.375
and I saved
your brother's life.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.959
Repay the kindness.

31:02.583 --> 31:05.250
Who else was in the house?

31:05.250 --> 31:07.083
Charlotte's
in Sun Valley.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.375
Staff went home.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.333
[cell phone beeps]

31:17.333 --> 31:19.375
[line trilling]

31:19.375 --> 31:21.583
[cell phone rings]

31:21.583 --> 31:23.500
- Yep?
- I need you to come over

31:23.500 --> 31:24.542
to the Finney house.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.000
What about Helen Miller?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.792
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

31:27.792 --> 31:29.792
- They gave her anti-venom.
- Okay.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.125
Just get over here.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.333
And, Lena...

31:33.333 --> 31:35.250
do me a favor.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.208
Call Avi.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.709
Tell him I need him.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.500
[breathes deeply]

31:59.500 --> 32:02.792
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.208
You play gin?

32:51.208 --> 32:52.667
We got a weekly game here--

32:52.667 --> 32:55.750
me and the other
retired fellows.

32:55.750 --> 32:57.375
I don't play gin.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.458
Oh, well,
sometimes we, uh...

33:00.458 --> 33:01.875
we go lawn bowling

33:01.875 --> 33:05.000
over there
at the Senior Citizens Center

33:05.000 --> 33:06.291
over in Tujunga.

33:17.917 --> 33:21.083
I got, uh, business
to attend to.

33:32.959 --> 33:36.125
[siren wailing in the distance]

33:41.750 --> 33:44.625
[cell phone beeping]

33:45.792 --> 33:48.875
[line trilling]

34:30.291 --> 34:32.250
Greg?

34:32.250 --> 34:34.333
Don't call me that.

34:38.542 --> 34:41.333
Can I stay?

34:41.333 --> 34:42.375
No.

35:00.792 --> 35:03.083
You're just lonely,
Bridget.

35:04.959 --> 35:08.041
That's true.

35:08.041 --> 35:12.208
Staying here with me
is not gonna change that.

35:14.250 --> 35:17.959
No matter what,
you're still gonna be lonely.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.375
I know that.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.750
Okay, you cover the site.
I'll take care of the body.

36:06.792 --> 36:09.625
- Anyone else know about it?
- About what?

36:09.625 --> 36:12.458
Your relationship.

36:12.458 --> 36:13.458
No.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.333
You sure?

36:15.333 --> 36:17.750
[Finney]
Only Paige.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.667
Varick have any family--anyone
who might come looking for him?

36:20.667 --> 36:22.750
A sister in Scranton.
Apart from that, nobody.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.041
Mr. Finney.

36:24.041 --> 36:25.750
- Where did you wash your hands?
- What?

36:25.750 --> 36:27.625
They can pull DNA
from the pipes.

36:27.625 --> 36:31.333
Oh, I showered and changed
in the--the--the bathroom

36:31.333 --> 36:32.709
in the hall.

36:32.709 --> 36:35.250
Here. Remember,
don't run the sink.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.542
- Pour directly in the pipes.
- Yep.

36:37.542 --> 36:39.917
You ever set up a trust
account for Paige and Varick?

36:39.917 --> 36:41.917
- Yeah.
- I need you to empty it,

36:41.917 --> 36:43.917
make it look like Varick
made a withdrawal.

36:43.917 --> 36:46.625
I need you to do that now.

36:46.625 --> 36:49.083
One more thing--

36:49.083 --> 36:51.834
Later on today,
you're gonna call Paige,

36:51.834 --> 36:54.667
and you're gonna tell her you'll
reconsider the Napier deal.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.542
You understand?

36:58.959 --> 37:00.792
Oh, yeah, I understand.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.166
Good.

37:04.208 --> 37:06.792
- Ready?
- Yeah.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.333
Grab his legs.

37:24.166 --> 37:27.250
It takes a long time,
digging a grave.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.709
Lena says
your brother's very sick.

37:35.709 --> 37:38.125
Parkinson's only goes
in one direction.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.875
I killed people before, Ray.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.375
I never killed a woman.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.125
[breathing heavily]

37:59.750 --> 38:03.333
[breathing heavily]

38:03.333 --> 38:06.041
Ezra said
the girl has to die.

38:07.792 --> 38:09.959
So I was
on a plane to Boston,

38:09.959 --> 38:12.000
praying to God
the whole way

38:12.000 --> 38:14.917
that it can be different.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.917
I'm in her room,
waiting for the door to open,

38:17.917 --> 38:20.208
the whole time
my hand on the gun,

38:20.208 --> 38:22.208
knowing it has to be me.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.083
You have to listen to me.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.083
I cannot talk
to the rabbi.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.417
I cannot talk
to anybody.

38:27.417 --> 38:30.250
The one person
I can tell about this is you,

38:30.250 --> 38:32.000
and you shun me
like a leper.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.417
I would've rather gone
to prison, Avi.

38:33.417 --> 38:34.709
Yeah, you say that.

38:34.709 --> 38:36.041
I would've rather done
my time.

38:36.041 --> 38:37.583
Well, somebody had to do it--

38:37.583 --> 38:41.291
if not for you,
then for your family.

38:41.291 --> 38:44.083
You know that's true.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.041
You know it.

38:46.041 --> 38:50.166
[both breathing heavily]

38:58.291 --> 39:00.458
I'll meet you back
at the office.

39:09.792 --> 39:11.041
What do you think?

39:11.041 --> 39:12.458
I know what
you're doing, Abby.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.583
Why don't you take a minute
in here?

39:18.583 --> 39:20.458
I ain't staying.

39:20.458 --> 39:23.083
It'd be nice to have someone
around the house to talk to.

39:23.083 --> 39:25.166
You got Ray.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.834
No, I don't.

39:26.834 --> 39:29.333
You know that.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.792
None of us got Ray.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.959
What's the matter?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.500
He didn't come home
last night.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.500
I thought
things were better,

39:44.500 --> 39:47.375
and now, again,
he's not coming home.

39:52.083 --> 39:55.333
I don't know
what to do, Terry.

39:55.333 --> 39:59.041
Don't got
to do nothing, Abby.

39:59.041 --> 40:03.125
You're not the one
with the problem.

40:03.125 --> 40:04.709
It's gonna be all right.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.500
Don't worry your head.

40:14.375 --> 40:15.959
Hey, you know what?

40:15.959 --> 40:18.417
What?

40:18.417 --> 40:21.500
- This is a nice fucking room.
- [laughs]

40:21.500 --> 40:23.542
Thanks.

40:23.542 --> 40:26.542
I got to make
a few phone calls.

40:26.542 --> 40:29.917
I'll take you back to the club
when I'm done, all right?

40:57.792 --> 40:59.417
What happened
with Napier?

40:59.417 --> 41:00.750
It fell apart.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.250
Well, isn't there
anything else you can do

41:02.250 --> 41:03.542
to get him
to change his mind?

41:03.542 --> 41:06.083
- No.
- The fucking deal, Ray--

41:06.083 --> 41:07.750
Varick paid your father
a visit and threatened to go

41:07.750 --> 41:09.250
to the press
with their relationship.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.333
Okay, that's my father's
worry, not ours.

41:11.333 --> 41:14.375
- I need Varick's passport.
- Are you stupid?

41:14.375 --> 41:16.583
There is an order
of priority here,

41:16.583 --> 41:18.500
and first up is Napier.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.417
Paige, your father
wants me to control this thing.

41:20.417 --> 41:23.166
I need you
to handle Napier.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.375
Ray, I need this fix.

41:25.375 --> 41:28.083
The passport
is the fucking fix.

41:33.083 --> 41:35.041
Most countries
are backward.

41:35.041 --> 41:36.583
Not all.

41:36.583 --> 41:40.083
Take Amsterdam.
They got it figured out there.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.583
Men can smoke
a little dope,

41:42.583 --> 41:45.083
have sex
with a stranger for money.

41:45.083 --> 41:48.125
no one bats a fucking eye.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.959
That's like--
like cheese.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.375
Mm.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.041
- You ever been there?
- What, Amsterdam?

41:54.041 --> 41:55.959
On my salary?

41:55.959 --> 41:58.250
I can barely afford
to take my kids to SeaWorld.

41:58.250 --> 41:59.750
Amsterdam--I'm telling you,

41:59.750 --> 42:01.542
they don't judge a man
for his proclivities.

42:01.542 --> 42:05.417
They live and let live.

42:05.417 --> 42:09.208
Mr. Donovan,
you made the call to me.

42:11.667 --> 42:14.375
Are you gonna help us or not?

42:17.542 --> 42:19.625
Right, right.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.667
Lena rented a car
in Varick's name.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.583
It's parked out back.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.250
I want you to drive it down
to Rosarito,

42:34.250 --> 42:35.667
use his passport
at the border,

42:35.667 --> 42:38.667
then fly
to Mexico City tomorrow.

42:39.792 --> 42:42.166
[clears throat]

42:43.750 --> 42:45.375
This is a rush job.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.667
- Close enough.
- Yeah?

42:57.500 --> 42:59.667
I appreciate you
doing this, Avi.

42:59.667 --> 43:02.500
Ah, it's no problem.

43:02.500 --> 43:06.375
When you get back,
give me a call.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.750
Okay.

43:11.959 --> 43:15.208
[footsteps approaching]

43:17.458 --> 43:18.959
Hey, Terry.

43:18.959 --> 43:20.417
Ready to go?

43:20.417 --> 43:22.709
Uh, no,
I'm gonna wait for Ray.

43:22.709 --> 43:26.166
You might be waiting
a long fucking time.

43:26.166 --> 43:29.000
I want to give him
something.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.625
I'll set a place for dinner
for you.

43:36.291 --> 43:37.875
[Ray]
You need to remember

43:37.875 --> 43:39.417
- what I'm about to tell you.
- All right.

43:39.417 --> 43:40.875
Varick came to see you

43:40.875 --> 43:42.667
after Paige served him
with divorce papers.

43:42.667 --> 43:43.875
He was angry.

43:43.875 --> 43:45.208
He took the money
from the trust

43:45.208 --> 43:47.667
- and disappeared.
- Okay.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.917
In three days,
you're gonna hire a PI.

43:49.917 --> 43:51.667
I'm gonna give you a name.

43:51.667 --> 43:53.458
The guy's a fucking idiot,
but eventually

43:53.458 --> 43:54.792
he's gonna figure out
that Varick took the money

43:54.792 --> 43:56.208
and fled to Belize.

43:56.208 --> 43:57.792
Let him leak the story.

43:57.792 --> 43:59.083
The papers will run something
about the divorce.

43:59.083 --> 44:00.375
They'll come to you
for a comment.

44:00.375 --> 44:02.125
Don't give 'em one.

44:02.125 --> 44:02.959
You got it?

44:02.959 --> 44:04.417
I got it.

44:06.417 --> 44:10.542
Paige, dear,
thank you for coming over.

44:10.542 --> 44:13.500
Varick stole $8 million
from the fund

44:13.500 --> 44:16.667
- I set up for you and him.
- How?

44:16.667 --> 44:18.375
We don't know,
but the money's gone.

44:18.375 --> 44:21.834
He's gone,
and we're sure he did it.

44:21.834 --> 44:24.375
And I've also been thinking
about the Napier deal,

44:24.375 --> 44:25.709
and I've reconsidered
my position.

44:25.709 --> 44:27.417
I'm gonna pay Napier's ask.

44:27.417 --> 44:29.709
We'll acquire the rest
of the land,

44:29.709 --> 44:33.500
and then I'm gonna let you
run the show.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.291
Why?

44:36.291 --> 44:39.542
'Cause it's a good idea,

44:39.542 --> 44:43.166
and because it's time for me
to step aside and let you lead.

44:47.333 --> 44:49.291
Well, it has to be done
by tonight.

44:49.291 --> 44:50.333
Just call Napier.

44:50.333 --> 44:51.959
Close the deal, hmm?

44:51.959 --> 44:55.542
I need a couple of more minutes
with Ray, anyway.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.542
Thank you for this.

45:07.625 --> 45:10.542
Where'd you bury him?

45:10.542 --> 45:13.166
- I can't tell you that.
- Where'd you bury him?

45:13.166 --> 45:16.000
I can't tell you. Trust me,
it's better if you don't know.

45:19.375 --> 45:21.959
Will you sit with me
for a moment, hmm?

45:21.959 --> 45:25.000
- That's all he's gonna get.
- What do you mean?

45:25.000 --> 45:29.750
His funeral will be
you and me sitting together.

45:31.959 --> 45:33.834
Right.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.333
Thank you, Ray.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
[exhales deeply]

46:08.000 --> 46:09.709
So how'd you get my father
to change his mind?

46:09.709 --> 46:11.709
I'm helping him deal
with Varick.

46:11.709 --> 46:12.875
Varick stealing
my trust fund

46:12.875 --> 46:14.834
doesn't mean a thing
to my father.

46:14.834 --> 46:16.458
Maybe you do.

46:16.458 --> 46:18.959
"The passport
is the fix"?

46:21.542 --> 46:22.917
You made a side deal.
I know you.

46:22.917 --> 46:25.625
You got what you wanted,
didn't you?

46:31.834 --> 46:33.208
Fine.

46:35.750 --> 46:37.917
Congratulations, partner.

Let me remind you

47:12.959 --> 47:16.875
of the House of Mouse rules--

47:16.875 --> 47:19.625
no smoking,

47:19.625 --> 47:23.125
no villainous schemes,

47:23.125 --> 47:26.083
and no guests
eating other guests.

47:26.083 --> 47:28.083
[laughter, chatter]

47:28.083 --> 47:31.041
...sounds sort
of like Edith Bunker now.

47:31.041 --> 47:35.625
Archie! Archie,
come down here and walk Pluto.

47:35.625 --> 47:37.750
He keeps licking my toes.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.875
Go on,
go to the kitchen...

47:43.583 --> 47:45.166
Watch, dear Lord,

47:45.166 --> 47:49.166
with those who wake or watch
or weep tonight,

47:49.166 --> 47:53.125
and give your angels
charge over those who sleep.
