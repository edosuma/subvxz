00:12.092 --> 00:16.792
We'll sail away... under the seas.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.704
Dive. Dive.

00:22.902 --> 00:27.602
Dive. Dive.

00:54.229 --> 00:56.170
You love, Dickens?

00:56.404 --> 00:57.745
No I don't.

00:57.971 --> 01:01.799
You want to kiss the cut on his head
and hold hands.

01:02.065 --> 01:04.397
But, he's a sissy.

01:04.623 --> 01:07.818
He's a shark hunter.
He has a submarine too.

01:08.014 --> 01:09.769
Except it's a fake.

01:09.964 --> 01:12.778
He's gonna be rich and buy a real one.

01:12.971 --> 01:15.784
He has more pennies than you.

01:16.489 --> 01:20.229
Hey, wait for me.
That monster shark might be about.

01:20.423 --> 01:24.163
Don't worry.
Dickens the sea captain will save us.

01:24.741 --> 01:27.423
He's sailing under the seas now.

01:27.875 --> 01:31.485
He's diving deep to the place
where dreams are made.

01:31.681 --> 01:36.534
"He walks a lonely shore all littered
with dreams and hopes..."

01:37.406 --> 01:40.982
Dickens, my brave sea captain.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.059
Avast ye, you scurvy...

01:55.380 --> 01:58.510
I'll have you keelhauled.

01:58.739 --> 02:03.046
I'll have you strung to the yard arm
and sent to Davey Jones's locker!

02:03.280 --> 02:05.668
- Have mercy on my soul!
- Mutiny.

02:05.870 --> 02:10.275
Looks like the pirate took
the captain prisoner.

02:11.148 --> 02:16.001
- Mercy.
- Those who die will be the lucky ones!

02:19.367 --> 02:22.083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:22.341 --> 02:25.787
Wait a minute,
he looks more like a farmer.

02:26.435 --> 02:28.573
He's not really a captain...

02:29.761 --> 02:33.589
- or a prisoner or anything.
- Go on in, Dickens.

02:33.792 --> 02:38.045
- Stay in your room till I call you out.
- Okay, Dell, okay.

02:40.604 --> 02:43.058
Afternoon, Miss Munro.

02:43.642 --> 02:45.135
Hello, Patrick.

02:45.785 --> 02:50.517
Is it afternoon?
My, how the day flies, you know.

02:51.222 --> 02:53.642
"My, how the day flies you know."

02:56.563 --> 02:59.180
I do appreciate all you do for me,
Patrick.

03:00.081 --> 03:03.211
You are such a kind young man.

03:04.303 --> 03:07.945
- Well, I always try...
- I know.

03:08.461 --> 03:10.532
I know. Now, Patrick...

03:11.435 --> 03:15.175
these deliveries...
they is all paid for, ain't they?

03:16.105 --> 03:17.282
Sure.

03:18.887 --> 03:20.413
Thank you.

03:22.693 --> 03:24.186
Are you...

03:24.484 --> 03:26.109
are you go...

03:26.595 --> 03:28.154
will you...

03:29.697 --> 03:30.972
I will.

03:32.223 --> 03:35.255
I will... but not here.

03:36.221 --> 03:37.911
Not in the yard...

03:38.525 --> 03:40.312
not by the tomatoes.

04:23.716 --> 04:25.603
It's a zoo room.

04:26.147 --> 04:29.047
It stinks of disinfectant.

04:41.595 --> 04:43.088
Miss Munro.

04:46.232 --> 04:47.889
What are they doing?

04:48.438 --> 04:50.892
She's touching his boy-thing.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.669
It's gone all angry and red!

04:54.963 --> 04:57.101
She's kissing it!

04:59.344 --> 05:01.896
She's sucking his blood!

05:10.155 --> 05:13.797
- He's trying to call for help.
- She's a vampire.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.577
You're next.

05:18.854 --> 05:22.300
Oh, shit. Why'd you stop, Miss Mun...

05:37.564 --> 05:40.693
We're safe. We escaped.

05:42.681 --> 05:45.330
I thought she was gonna be my friend.

05:47.318 --> 05:51.691
Say... isn't that the rabbit hole you found?

05:53.971 --> 05:56.141
It looks bigger than before.

05:57.777 --> 05:59.685
Maybe I could crawl in.

06:00.784 --> 06:03.149
I want to look in. Show me.

06:04.974 --> 06:06.882
Okay. All right.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.163
Mustique!

06:16.391 --> 06:19.205
I'm falling very slowly, dear.

06:19.462 --> 06:24.281
The sides of the holes are filled
with cupboards and book-shelves.

06:25.186 --> 06:26.363
Can you hear me?

06:27.361 --> 06:29.978
No, don't listen to her!

06:30.815 --> 06:32.953
She's gone, Jeliza-Rose.

06:33.182 --> 06:39.408
It's too dangerous to rescue Mustique.
You have to face up to it.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.990
Take that! She's not dead yet.

06:43.576 --> 06:46.030
You just wanna take her place.

06:47.382 --> 06:48.789
You're all traitors.

06:49.301 --> 06:53.522
You don't have hearts.
You're just heads!

06:55.282 --> 06:57.386
- And you too!
- No, no.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.739
Jeliza-Rose, please.
I want to help save Mustique.

07:01.966 --> 07:06.786
I truly do. Because of my eyes,
I can sense things in the dark.

07:07.947 --> 07:10.019
You're better than those other two.

07:11.241 --> 07:14.436
I'm sorry Mustique was so mean to you.

07:20.964 --> 07:22.905
I'm almost a ghost.

07:24.003 --> 07:26.685
That's why Dell didn't see me.

07:28.352 --> 07:30.294
I really think I am...

07:30.975 --> 07:31.868
don't you?

07:32.062 --> 07:36.599
I really can't say, Jeliza-Rose.
I don't know about those things.

07:43.351 --> 07:45.205
Come in, Mustique.

07:46.102 --> 07:47.312
Are you there?

07:48.469 --> 07:49.712
Can you hear me?

07:50.580 --> 07:52.913
This is radio Jeliza-Rose.

07:54.162 --> 07:57.291
Am I loud and clear?
Come in, please.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.821
Over.

08:25.314 --> 08:26.687
Dickens?

08:27.456 --> 08:29.178
Thought you was a squirrel.

08:29.535 --> 08:30.843
He's spoiled.

08:33.341 --> 08:35.096
He's cutting muffins, is all.

08:36.283 --> 08:41.876
I guess that's what it is... I guess.
Whatever it is.

08:42.296 --> 08:44.683
Your daddy sleeps a lot.

08:45.207 --> 08:48.521
- My mama does too.
- Is she a ghost?

08:49.172 --> 08:52.334
No, not any more. Not really.

08:52.563 --> 08:54.252
She's just a dozer.

08:54.769 --> 08:57.582
She isn't as pretty as your daddy.

08:57.903 --> 09:00.902
Her hair isn't nice like his is.

09:01.454 --> 09:03.340
It's only fake.

09:03.533 --> 09:04.460
See.

09:07.914 --> 09:11.295
That's funny.
You fooled me because I didn't know.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.599
It's not supposed to be funny.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.597
It was Mustique's idea.

09:19.108 --> 09:22.335
Dickens... will you help me
save my friend?

09:22.498 --> 09:27.165
She may be dying.
She's farther than the ocean, I think.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.915
I probably can't do it.

09:34.268 --> 09:36.372
But you're the captain!

09:36.570 --> 09:41.008
Yeah, I am.
Because I've got my own submarine.

09:41.752 --> 09:45.394
Can we feed the shark?
I'd like to do that.

09:46.006 --> 09:50.640
If you want you can help me too.
We can lure it.

09:50.962 --> 09:52.784
Meaner than death.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.343
Okay, I'll help you.

09:56.623 --> 09:58.727
Then you'll rescue my friend?

10:00.238 --> 10:01.099
Yeah.

10:03.277 --> 10:04.705
What'll happen?

10:08.266 --> 10:09.956
The end of the world.

10:10.601 --> 10:12.574
The monster shark will die?

10:14.502 --> 10:16.956
The monster shark never dies.

10:27.391 --> 10:28.601
Bad dog.

10:29.310 --> 10:32.123
You watered all the fish and seaweeds.

10:32.796 --> 10:34.737
Bad dog!

10:34.971 --> 10:38.133
- You're the bad dog.
- No, you're the bad dog.

10:38.809 --> 10:42.931
- You're a bad dog!
- You're a bad dog for looking.

10:43.766 --> 10:45.588
We better go.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.746
If the monster shark catches us here,
we're doomed.

10:50.098 --> 10:51.178
Monster shark!

10:51.507 --> 10:55.977
Monster shark. Gonna kill you.
It's gonna eat you.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.542
The bus! We can hide there.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.761
No, that's a bad place.
It's wrong there.

11:02.988 --> 11:04.874
No. Come on!

11:06.058 --> 11:07.519
Can't go there.

11:08.393 --> 11:13.180
You use the bus for shark bait
and it tips over and burns up.

11:14.182 --> 11:15.905
And then you get in trouble.

11:16.069 --> 11:20.027
And Officer Waller said "You can't
drive a bus on the tracks, Dickens...

11:20.227 --> 11:24.763
you should know that.
That'll get you sent away, Dickens."

11:24.960 --> 11:27.348
So I can't go there with you.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.678
I can't go there with you.

11:31.549 --> 11:34.264
Captain, you're acting wei...

11:34.459 --> 11:35.887
- silly - Can't go.

11:36.634 --> 11:40.309
Sometimes you just worry about it
too much.

11:41.015 --> 11:44.658
Just pretend it never happened, okay?

11:46.645 --> 11:49.458
I better go home now and eat, I think.

11:49.586 --> 11:52.040
Maybe we can find some food together.

11:52.817 --> 11:55.597
We shouldn't play no more today.

11:56.719 --> 12:00.808
You have to save my friend.
You said you'd do that.

12:01.068 --> 12:06.248
I don't know, because I make mistakes
if I try some things.

12:06.954 --> 12:08.960
But you have to.

12:10.536 --> 12:12.869
You promised.

12:14.278 --> 12:16.000
What is your friend?

12:16.197 --> 12:17.211
A head.

12:17.827 --> 12:20.543
- A doll's head.
- Does she bite?

12:20.738 --> 12:21.785
No.

12:22.497 --> 12:24.635
Her mouth is like this.

12:28.606 --> 12:30.460
She doesn't have teeth.

12:30.685 --> 12:33.782
All right. Okay.

12:42.006 --> 12:46.411
Wait! I got her. It has to be her.

12:46.612 --> 12:49.577
- It has to be.
- Yeah, it has to be!

12:55.087 --> 12:56.875
No, it's weird.

12:58.381 --> 13:01.925
It's not a head at all,
it's not like what you said.

13:02.379 --> 13:05.247
And that's all that's down there, okay?

13:05.450 --> 13:08.350
There's nothing but dirt and more dirt.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.205
She's dead.

13:15.556 --> 13:18.075
I can feel something coming.

13:19.394 --> 13:23.516
It's the monster shark!
He's coming for the bait!

13:25.407 --> 13:28.504
- Look out!
- Wait! Where are you going?

13:30.556 --> 13:32.759
Dickens! Dickens!

13:33.530 --> 13:34.839
Dickens!

13:35.385 --> 13:37.969
Damn you. Trouble-maker!

13:38.200 --> 13:40.206
Vandal!

13:53.168 --> 13:56.843
Hold on, Jeliza-Rose. We're coming.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.149
Come on, hurry up.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.803
Is she dead?

14:03.690 --> 14:05.664
I can't be sure.

14:05.993 --> 14:08.806
Look, she's breathing.

14:09.735 --> 14:15.296
She's weak. And must be pretty hungry,
pretty thirsty too.

14:15.843 --> 14:18.013
What's that?

14:19.714 --> 14:22.331
Smells like disinfectant.

14:23.007 --> 14:26.966
- Look, I try to be good, okay.
- Dickens...

14:27.261 --> 14:30.358
And I'll get the boy.

14:32.315 --> 14:34.550
Where are you going, Jeliza-Rose?

14:34.745 --> 14:38.289
Don't go downstairs. Dell's there.

14:38.455 --> 14:40.788
Don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

14:41.302 --> 14:44.431
I wish Mustique were here.

14:44.660 --> 14:47.561
Don't cry. Mustique's gone forever.

14:47.795 --> 14:51.142
Don't go downstairs. I'm afraid.

14:51.408 --> 14:54.668
- You're always crying.
- Baby.

14:55.342 --> 14:57.480
- I'm not a baby.
- You act like one.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.209
Cry baby.

14:59.436 --> 15:04.583
Cry, cry baby, cry baby.

15:06.057 --> 15:08.390
Maybe you two want to come with me?

15:10.055 --> 15:11.908
Well, you're coming anyhow.

15:13.252 --> 15:16.317
Please don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

15:17.186 --> 15:20.119
What is that terrible smell?

15:20.801 --> 15:22.261
I told you...

15:22.751 --> 15:24.638
disinfectant.

15:27.933 --> 15:30.833
What can she be doing down there?

15:32.346 --> 15:33.720
I don't know.

15:35.257 --> 15:36.533
We'll find out.

15:51.568 --> 15:54.284
To meet again like this...

15:54.703 --> 15:58.410
I won't let you go though. Not again.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.200
No more running away.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.340
I love you so much.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.783
There's so much damage done already.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.311
But I'll save what's left. Oh, I will.

16:21.727 --> 16:23.155
Put this there.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.201
- Who welcomed you down here, child?
- Not me, Dell, I didn't!

16:31.130 --> 16:32.112
Not me.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.500
Wigs and blush, they won't cut it, child.

16:36.727 --> 16:39.693
You can stay and watch if you must,
but you be quiet or else.

16:44.915 --> 16:46.539
Now I want to chill him.

16:47.346 --> 16:49.035
What a mess.

16:53.071 --> 16:56.004
This isn't fun. This is a sad man.

16:56.205 --> 16:58.625
This a sad, sad man.

16:59.179 --> 17:00.127
Now...

17:06.152 --> 17:08.006
Sinister apples.

17:08.262 --> 17:10.847
Sinister, sinister apples.

17:13.891 --> 17:15.297
I'm tired, I'm tired, tired, tired.

17:15.521 --> 17:18.009
See the skin has to be peeled.

17:18.209 --> 17:19.734
And then the fat trimmed...

17:19.935 --> 17:23.164
and the bones, they get sprinkled
with powdered Borax...

17:23.390 --> 17:26.422
then the shaping of the wire begins...

17:26.684 --> 17:29.498
and the mending,
the sewing, the varnishing...

17:36.183 --> 17:37.197
Rose.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.633
Rose.

17:41.653 --> 17:43.408
Arise, Rose...

17:43.955 --> 17:45.809
and behold Noah.

17:48.113 --> 17:52.072
- Is he all better now?
- Course he's better, course he is.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.175
Are you gonna give him something?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.344
A gift for his new life.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.410
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.

18:01.642 --> 18:04.902
You have to choose. It has to be
something dear to you, though.

18:09.445 --> 18:12.640
- No, not me!
- No, not me.

18:12.868 --> 18:15.768
- No, don't. Oh, please. Please!
- Don't, Jeliza-Rose... I'm scared.

18:16.065 --> 18:20.852
Not me! Jeliza-Rose, I'm your friend.

18:21.119 --> 18:22.492
Jeliza-Rose!

18:22.750 --> 18:24.059
- Goodbye. - No.

18:25.949 --> 18:27.606
Have a nice trip.

18:29.306 --> 18:32.272
Jeliza-Rose, get me out.

18:32.601 --> 18:38.064
- We're so afraid!
- Somebody save me. Help!

18:38.645 --> 18:41.132
Can anyone hear me? Help!

18:43.027 --> 18:45.392
You brought Noah back to me.

18:46.865 --> 18:48.936
So we'll share him now.

18:52.046 --> 18:53.572
But you're his.

18:54.605 --> 18:56.164
You understand, child?

19:06.918 --> 19:09.469
Go to the porch, draw in,
it's the fumes.

19:10.437 --> 19:12.290
It's unhealthy for your lungs.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.527
Go on, get!

19:34.711 --> 19:36.401
It's a new day.

19:38.453 --> 19:40.111
We'll get your house in order.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.640
An untidy home means an untidy person.

19:45.457 --> 19:47.845
Monster! You nasty thing!

19:50.638 --> 19:51.815
Nasty thing.

19:53.581 --> 19:56.427
Come on, things to do.
Come on. Up. Up!

19:58.730 --> 19:59.657
Dickens.

20:02.152 --> 20:04.289
- Gotta clean, clean, clean.
- Clean, clean, clean.

20:07.717 --> 20:09.723
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

20:09.988 --> 20:13.401
And clean the tarnished soul

20:14.402 --> 20:17.662
He will heal me
Make me whole

20:17.888 --> 20:18.836
Wipe it!

20:22.429 --> 20:24.087
Rise and shine

20:24.317 --> 20:27.893
Rise and shine

20:28.122 --> 20:33.138
We'll rise and shine with Jesus
In my new home in the sky

20:33.335 --> 20:35.920
With loaves and fish He'll feed us

20:36.150 --> 20:38.515
His pierced hands will lead us

20:38.772 --> 20:43.952
And we'll rise and shine with Jesus
in the sky

20:44.210 --> 20:46.598
Now when we get to heaven

20:46.864 --> 20:49.416
That sin'll be all compared

20:49.615 --> 20:54.468
And angel's wings we're given
as we climb them golden stairs

20:54.668 --> 20:57.928
I'm gonna strip off
and put on a pure white robe

20:58.154 --> 21:00.325
Scrub clean my sinful soul

21:00.521 --> 21:03.073
So wash me in the blood

21:03.335 --> 21:09.409
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

21:10.883 --> 21:11.864
Now...

21:13.506 --> 21:16.439
seal your eyes and mouth,
extend your arms and hold your breath.

21:19.838 --> 21:21.779
Do your panties.

21:23.932 --> 21:27.607
Beer braised rabbit with carrots
and onions and potatoes.

21:27.866 --> 21:30.963
A jar of lemonade and butter tarts
for dessert.

21:31.512 --> 21:34.739
Fruits of Eden all for the children of Noah.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.073
Jeliza-Rose...

21:40.275 --> 21:41.801
this is where you belong...

21:42.674 --> 21:45.989
Jeliza... this is where you belong.
You're part...

21:46.704 --> 21:49.604
you're part of the family now,
you hear me?

21:49.838 --> 21:52.258
We cannot have any strangers here.

21:52.429 --> 21:54.883
They'd take daddy away from us.
Do you hear me?

21:59.305 --> 22:00.711
Dear Lord...

22:02.247 --> 22:06.020
I hold up a hand to Death.
I keep that troublesome stranger away.

22:06.341 --> 22:08.031
- That is my calling. - Hallelujah.

22:08.228 --> 22:11.456
When you love something,
it doesn't have to die or go in the ground.

22:11.682 --> 22:16.316
Nothing has to change, for I am
the keeper of the silent souls. Amen.

22:16.543 --> 22:17.917
Amen.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.843
Now, eat. Stuff yourselves.

22:22.109 --> 22:23.220
Yeah.

22:27.865 --> 22:29.042
He's good.

22:30.456 --> 22:32.463
I waited for you for so long.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.226
And now...

22:34.678 --> 22:37.360
after all these years, to have you here...

22:37.940 --> 22:39.281
I love gravy.

22:39.539 --> 22:42.287
- You won't be leaving me again.
- Lemonade.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.576
You'll be staying put for a long while.

22:51.085 --> 22:53.287
He looks like a burrito.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.268
Sleep of the just.

22:58.090 --> 23:02.310
Did you ever know the old lady?
Rose, you ever know your grandma?

23:02.919 --> 23:05.764
She died when I wasn't even born yet.

23:06.980 --> 23:11.353
You missed a saint.
I owe her my life.

23:11.586 --> 23:14.933
She tended my sorry body
after that bee darn near killed me.

23:17.215 --> 23:20.028
Nasty, nasty bees.

23:21.020 --> 23:24.466
Nasty...

23:24.762 --> 23:27.128
buzzy bees.

23:27.801 --> 23:29.044
Course I...

23:29.304 --> 23:32.979
I can see more than most,
even with my eyes closed.

23:33.174 --> 23:34.122
Yes.

23:34.453 --> 23:36.841
I can see birds and...

23:37.108 --> 23:39.692
rabbits and...

23:42.066 --> 23:45.675
curious little girls hiding behind bushes.

23:50.412 --> 23:52.964
I can see everything you can imagine.

23:55.626 --> 23:56.999
Course...

23:57.992 --> 24:01.220
curious little girls hiding behind bushes...

24:01.479 --> 24:03.965
sometimes see more than they should.

24:05.412 --> 24:08.029
Best minding one's own business,
you hear me?

24:09.027 --> 24:11.644
Otherwise, Rose,
bad things might happen.

24:12.065 --> 24:15.260
Bad, bad things might happen
under the sun.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.798
You smell awful.
You reek of the devil, Rose!

24:31.511 --> 24:32.525
You're dead.

24:34.613 --> 24:36.815
You finished making that trap, Dickens?

24:37.491 --> 24:38.439
Dickens!

24:42.065 --> 24:43.079
Nasty.

24:43.696 --> 24:44.775
Diseased.

24:56.553 --> 24:58.375
Come on, hurry up now, Dickens.

24:59.719 --> 25:00.701
Nasty.

25:44.303 --> 25:46.091
Sateen Lips?

25:47.502 --> 25:49.061
Baby Blonde?

25:52.491 --> 25:55.304
- Are you there?
- Yeah, hallelujah.

25:56.616 --> 26:01.764
Behold brothers and sisters,
she's been washed in the blood of Jesus.

26:01.957 --> 26:04.290
A full recovery is expected.

26:04.581 --> 26:08.539
I've never been so happy.
I'm alive!

26:09.250 --> 26:12.477
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

26:13.279 --> 26:14.937
Honey, I'm sorry.

26:15.135 --> 26:16.857
I'll do something nice for you soon.

26:17.086 --> 26:19.059
- I promise, baby.
- Hallelujah. She's born again.

26:19.772 --> 26:24.342
- Jesus is giving her a new brain.
- Have some chocolate.

26:24.537 --> 26:27.535
Wash me in the blood

26:27.800 --> 26:29.937
Rise and shine, dear.

26:34.325 --> 26:36.146
Mustique's alive!

26:36.498 --> 26:39.247
She's okay and happy.

26:39.505 --> 26:41.479
Just a dream. Trust me.

26:41.712 --> 26:44.710
- I know everything.
- Stop it.

26:45.294 --> 26:47.529
Stop pretending you're her.

26:47.789 --> 26:50.689
I have no idea what you're talking about.

26:50.891 --> 26:53.377
It's not just a dream!

26:57.960 --> 27:01.886
That's what you get! You're a bad dog!

27:15.358 --> 27:17.332
Hi, Jeliza-Rose.

27:17.597 --> 27:21.817
I better go because I didn't knock
and that's rude. So I'll go, okay?

27:23.290 --> 27:25.710
I didn't knock, so I'll go, okay?

27:25.912 --> 27:28.529
Don't go! Don't go.

27:28.759 --> 27:32.335
I've got good news.
Mustique's all right!

27:32.597 --> 27:35.312
She's in the hospital
but she's got a body...

27:35.539 --> 27:38.319
and she's gonna get a real brain too!

27:38.513 --> 27:41.359
I'd like a new brain sometimes.

27:41.584 --> 27:44.811
Because I think a new one is shiny!

27:45.038 --> 27:47.851
Yeah. She was happy.

27:48.076 --> 27:50.595
I guess she isn't a doll any more.

27:50.955 --> 27:52.579
She must be pretty.

27:54.249 --> 27:56.223
She's beautiful.

27:57.319 --> 28:00.416
She's fabulous, dear.

28:03.172 --> 28:07.392
And we're gonna make you fabulous
too, darling.

28:14.398 --> 28:15.575
That one.

28:17.085 --> 28:19.604
Scarlet Surrender is best.

28:20.315 --> 28:22.681
Now, sit still...

28:23.513 --> 28:27.504
- or you'll make me do it wrong.
- I won't move a muscle.

28:27.702 --> 28:31.312
As I don't have muscles anyway,
so I won't move them.

28:33.268 --> 28:34.674
Puff your lips.

28:36.050 --> 28:37.359
Get ready.

28:57.031 --> 28:58.143
There.

29:03.044 --> 29:04.865
I think you're nice.

29:12.094 --> 29:13.435
It's silly.

29:15.133 --> 29:17.074
You got red on me.

29:17.468 --> 29:19.190
Silly kisser.

29:21.785 --> 29:25.525
The old lady who lived here
was a silly kisser too.

29:26.327 --> 29:27.820
She kissed me.

29:28.598 --> 29:30.539
That was when I was little.

29:30.741 --> 29:32.562
She was my grandma.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.793
She never kissed me...

29:37.489 --> 29:39.659
because I didn't get born yet.

29:39.919 --> 29:43.529
Sometimes she did this in my mouth...

29:45.869 --> 29:47.843
and that was fun.

29:48.427 --> 29:51.208
It was a snake, I think...

29:51.529 --> 29:54.310
or a goldfish dancing.

29:54.856 --> 29:58.531
Some days I'd be here all day
kissing with her.

29:58.757 --> 30:02.781
She's a nice lady. Except she's dead.

30:03.746 --> 30:05.153
Dickens...

30:08.385 --> 30:10.620
she was your girlfriend.

30:11.326 --> 30:13.780
You were her boyfriend.

30:18.395 --> 30:21.240
No...

30:21.466 --> 30:25.260
I was her cutie... I was her little cutie.

30:25.975 --> 30:27.948
But she...

30:29.429 --> 30:32.242
she did fall down the steps and die.

30:33.555 --> 30:36.651
I ran down when she did that.

30:37.009 --> 30:41.098
Because I was just little,
I didn't know what to do.

30:41.967 --> 30:44.267
I was scared.

30:46.508 --> 30:50.335
- She's nice lady. - Dickens...

30:55.783 --> 30:57.691
you're a little cutie.

31:04.418 --> 31:06.653
You're a little cutie too.

31:12.254 --> 31:13.879
Silly kissers!

31:14.396 --> 31:16.021
Silly kissers!

31:17.211 --> 31:18.072
Silly...

31:21.113 --> 31:22.061
A bomb!

31:23.703 --> 31:25.971
They're exploding the ground!

31:26.869 --> 31:30.032
It's bigger than firecrackers
and bullets.

31:30.228 --> 31:34.960
- I love firecrackers.
- Me too. I really do.

31:58.053 --> 32:00.256
It's the boom hole!

32:00.451 --> 32:02.272
It's the edge of the world.

32:02.467 --> 32:04.538
It's the Hundred Year Ocean.

32:13.501 --> 32:15.223
I got a secret.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.504
If I say, you can't tell, okay?

32:20.473 --> 32:25.456
Because if Dell knows she'll wallop me
good and I'll be in trouble forever.

32:25.686 --> 32:26.798
What is it?

32:29.396 --> 32:31.850
It's a giant atom bomb.

32:32.530 --> 32:34.896
And the end of the whole world.

32:35.089 --> 32:39.081
Yeah, like a big tidal wave
that goes whoosh!

32:39.502 --> 32:42.850
And everything gets cleaned away
like chemicals...

32:43.084 --> 32:46.596
and the Baby Jesus returns
forever and ever.

32:46.858 --> 32:48.286
Amen.

32:49.130 --> 32:50.274
I wanna see.

32:51.401 --> 32:56.286
I don't know. Maybe tomorrow
when Dell drives to town.

32:57.701 --> 32:59.358
If you show me...

33:01.123 --> 33:02.944
you can keep the arm.

33:03.841 --> 33:08.181
Is it a boy or a girl?
Because a girl is nice, I think.

33:08.415 --> 33:11.414
- It's a boy.
- How can you tell?

33:19.129 --> 33:24.177
- No, that doesn't mean it's a boy.
- Yes, it does.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.644
It's a thingy.

33:26.997 --> 33:29.451
You got a thingy. I know.

33:29.683 --> 33:32.431
No, that's wrong. I don't have that.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.147
I don't have that.

33:35.984 --> 33:37.260
Dickens.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.444
Dickens...

33:44.108 --> 33:46.441
I'd like to see your secret.

33:47.339 --> 33:48.680
I don't know.

33:53.415 --> 33:55.268
You're my boyfriend.

33:56.389 --> 33:57.850
My cutie.

34:00.068 --> 34:02.652
You're my dear sweet Captain...

34:04.129 --> 34:06.103
and I'm Mrs Captain.

34:07.263 --> 34:09.367
I don't understand that.

34:11.453 --> 34:13.656
I better go home, I think.

34:41.420 --> 34:46.340
Dickens has a girlfriend.
He's your boyfriend.

34:46.601 --> 34:48.511
He's my husband.

34:48.777 --> 34:52.387
And I... I... I...

34:52.710 --> 34:53.920
I'm his wife.

34:54.150 --> 34:57.727
He's dreamboat. He's a sunny cloud.

34:58.084 --> 34:59.164
Kiss me.

34:59.779 --> 35:03.225
- You're a girl.
- Kiss me and I'll be a boy.

35:03.841 --> 35:08.825
- Girls don't kiss girls that way.
- Please.

35:14.843 --> 35:16.729
Oh baby.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.470
You're disgusting.

35:24.694 --> 35:27.954
That was fun. That was great.

35:28.147 --> 35:31.658
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine too.

35:31.889 --> 35:33.993
And I love Dickens!

35:34.416 --> 35:39.051
He's the sweet prince.
He's the great king.

35:39.885 --> 35:42.273
He's apply juice and jerky!

35:42.572 --> 35:44.426
We're a happy family.

35:44.619 --> 35:48.162
And Dell will marry daddy
and look after us all.

35:48.617 --> 35:53.535
And we'll explore the Hundred
Years Ocean. It's a dream come true.

35:53.766 --> 35:55.772
It's Christmas!

36:10.653 --> 36:12.757
And what do we have here?

36:14.523 --> 36:17.423
I think a baby is in me from kissing.

36:17.849 --> 36:22.451
I think it's Mustique.
I think she's come back.

36:23.030 --> 36:25.680
Tell Dickens.
Tell him about the baby.

36:25.876 --> 36:30.097
Then he'll let you see his special secret.
Maybe he's alone.

36:31.825 --> 36:33.864
But maybe Dell's still there.

36:36.899 --> 36:38.043
Let's go.

36:38.274 --> 36:41.786
Let's go see Dickens special secret
in his room.

36:47.517 --> 36:50.582
My sweet honey rose

36:50.811 --> 36:54.519
Strange dark flower rose

36:54.617 --> 36:55.794
Jeliza-Rose

37:12.496 --> 37:15.047
Hello? It's us.

37:16.685 --> 37:18.539
It's Jeliza-Rose.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.839
It's a real nice day for a tea party.

37:25.289 --> 37:29.923
Me and Glitter Gal are here...
in case you're not too busy.

38:06.035 --> 38:09.164
Jeliza-Rose. See what happens when
you're small and hungry all the time?

38:09.393 --> 38:12.620
You're nasty. You deserve it.

38:12.847 --> 38:15.235
Maybe I am nasty,
but at least I'm alive.

38:15.470 --> 38:18.119
Get out while you can,
or she'll close a trap on you too!

38:18.604 --> 38:22.660
Shut up. Shut up!

38:24.169 --> 38:28.226
It's not fair! I didn't know
you were there. You scared me good!

38:28.422 --> 38:30.788
No, no, it was an accident.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.009
You just got spooked, that's all.

38:34.212 --> 38:37.406
- It was all them ugly dead things and all.
- No, that's not right.

38:37.665 --> 38:39.071
No, that's not right.

38:39.297 --> 38:42.906
Because Dell makes them alive again
and that's what she does!

38:43.103 --> 38:46.516
And she's Jesus how she makes
them alive again!

38:47.772 --> 38:50.105
You scared me good,
I didn't know you was there!

38:50.363 --> 38:51.769
I think I fainted.

38:52.313 --> 38:53.589
I'm sorry.

38:53.785 --> 38:56.598
Don't do that again or I'll die, okay?

38:57.079 --> 38:58.158
Okay.

38:59.222 --> 39:01.490
All right. I'm sorry.

39:02.516 --> 39:05.514
I think I'm sorry too. Think so.

39:10.224 --> 39:11.565
Dickens...

39:13.550 --> 39:16.331
Glitter Gal wants to tell you something.

39:24.808 --> 39:27.556
That baby sounds like a strange thing.

39:27.751 --> 39:31.971
We can build a castle...
and Dell will marry my daddy.

39:32.867 --> 39:34.077
But...

39:34.563 --> 39:38.423
you have to show me
your special secret first.

39:42.015 --> 39:44.348
No, I can't build a castle.
I don't know how.

39:44.573 --> 39:47.321
I don't know how. No.

39:49.339 --> 39:53.231
Dickens... if you show me your secret...

39:54.168 --> 39:56.109
I'll love you forever.

40:03.795 --> 40:08.397
I'll show you, okay? Just once only.

40:09.519 --> 40:13.794
But if I don't unpack this bag before
Dell gets back, I won't eat tonight.

40:14.029 --> 40:16.777
So you wait, okay? You wait.

40:17.036 --> 40:19.817
Don't touch nothing.
This is Dell's place.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.057
All right.

40:21.993 --> 40:24.031
I'll wait for my cutie.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.623
You're my kisser.

40:31.684 --> 40:34.716
What do you wanna see his special
secret for? You're better off not knowing.

40:34.882 --> 40:37.052
Look what happens. I was curious.

40:38.241 --> 40:39.800
You know what Dell's gonna do to me?

40:39.968 --> 40:41.244
We have to help him.

40:42.590 --> 40:46.582
You do it. I don't wanna get in trouble.

40:48.699 --> 40:51.065
That's it, that's it. I'm free, I'm free!

41:09.967 --> 41:13.260
We can't wake mama,
so we can't talk like this...

41:13.517 --> 41:15.687
unless we talk like this first.

41:18.219 --> 41:19.876
Because we're ghosts.

41:21.641 --> 41:25.054
- We're quiet ghosts.
- Nice.

41:27.397 --> 41:30.079
Your house is the witch's cave.

41:30.884 --> 41:34.624
We're disappearing
and we won't get caught.

41:34.850 --> 41:37.216
Yeah, that's a good idea, I think.

41:37.472 --> 41:40.122
Because Dell will wallop me
for having company.

41:58.581 --> 42:00.587
It's Halloween.

42:15.371 --> 42:18.436
My room! My room, my room.

42:20.425 --> 42:25.027
You better get on the bed so you don't
crush nothing important, okay?

42:25.255 --> 42:26.148
Okay.

42:45.660 --> 42:47.546
- Is there candy in it?
- No.

42:49.178 --> 42:51.445
It's my special secret.

42:52.088 --> 42:55.860
It's the eight wonder.
The great wave.

42:57.653 --> 42:59.474
The end of the world!

42:59.700 --> 43:00.910
Dynamite.

43:02.194 --> 43:05.509
- How do you explode them?
- Like a firecracker, I think.

43:05.712 --> 43:09.932
Like a war bomb! Boom! Kaboom!

43:10.158 --> 43:12.545
And everything gets cleaned away.

43:12.973 --> 43:16.615
The end of the world. Blown to bits.

43:17.354 --> 43:19.077
So I'll keep them.

43:20.201 --> 43:22.850
Yeah, I'll keep them until I'm an old man...

43:23.559 --> 43:27.964
and then I'll kill that shark...
and I'll be a hero...

43:28.165 --> 43:29.473
I'm pretty sure.

43:29.828 --> 43:34.048
And I'll help you.
That way we can be on TV.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.486
Because you love me.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.529
I'm your wife forever.

43:58.420 --> 44:01.386
That's baby's asleep, I think.

44:02.577 --> 44:04.202
It's snoring.

44:06.159 --> 44:07.500
She's growing.

44:08.654 --> 44:10.279
She's coming tonight...

44:10.989 --> 44:11.883
or tomorrow.

44:13.452 --> 44:15.306
I bet she's pretty.

44:16.266 --> 44:19.647
I bet she's pretty,
I bet she's pretty like you.

44:23.334 --> 44:24.860
Where's that place?

44:26.341 --> 44:28.958
The whole bottom of the ocean.

44:30.179 --> 44:34.552
There are whole cities there,
with people and dogs.

44:34.816 --> 44:39.996
There are castles there...
and farms and husbands and wives...

44:40.221 --> 44:44.245
and babies, and ghosts...

44:45.306 --> 44:47.444
and silly kissers too.

44:47.962 --> 44:50.295
And kissers that do this...

45:19.816 --> 45:22.564
- It's mama, I think.
- Is she awake?

45:22.982 --> 45:24.574
I don't know.

45:25.733 --> 45:28.546
Because that never happens,
but maybe it happens.

45:29.411 --> 45:32.638
If mama quit dozing
I'll go see if she wants soup.

45:34.656 --> 45:35.997
Dickens, I'm scared.

45:37.599 --> 45:38.972
Me too.

45:39.229 --> 45:42.708
If we go together, we're safe.

45:44.219 --> 45:45.528
Yeah, all right.

46:04.656 --> 46:05.800
Mama?

46:12.715 --> 46:14.503
It's damn bad.

46:21.031 --> 46:24.029
Dell says someday mama will wake.

46:24.261 --> 46:28.798
And she says someday there'll be a
pill or a story or something...

46:28.963 --> 46:31.776
and that'll make her eyes
come alive again.

46:32.001 --> 46:35.893
Because if she gets buried
she'll be gone for good.

46:36.575 --> 46:38.548
That's my gift.

46:41.564 --> 46:43.766
And that's daddy's map!

46:44.762 --> 46:47.128
No, no, they're Dell's.

46:48.088 --> 46:49.582
It's all hers.

46:50.903 --> 46:53.073
Her place is with mama.

47:04.431 --> 47:05.957
It's daddy.

47:08.813 --> 47:12.226
And that's Dell.
She was beautiful once.

47:12.427 --> 47:14.281
Not a pirate or a ghost.

47:15.177 --> 47:18.656
She had two good eyes
and she loved your daddy.

47:20.199 --> 47:22.107
They were kissers.

47:22.405 --> 47:24.160
Young kissers.

47:24.740 --> 47:27.772
Dell and my daddy were young kissers.

47:27.939 --> 47:28.800
No.

47:28.994 --> 47:31.197
They do it like we do it.

47:32.160 --> 47:35.639
No, no...

47:36.446 --> 47:38.332
They do it like we do it.

47:40.956 --> 47:42.329
I'm Dell...

47:42.683 --> 47:46.293
and you're my daddy...
and we're married...

47:46.808 --> 47:49.076
and our baby's coming.

47:55.731 --> 47:57.803
Filth! Evil!

47:58.002 --> 47:59.594
Rotten! Rotten!

47:59.794 --> 48:01.254
No, Dell!

48:01.488 --> 48:06.155
Doing that in here!
Dickens, bringing that nasty...

48:06.381 --> 48:08.998
- nastiness into our home!
- No, Dell, no.

48:09.228 --> 48:11.561
This is my room, mama's...

48:12.171 --> 48:15.998
I'm sorry, Dell, I'm sorry.

48:16.232 --> 48:17.857
Like father like daughter!

48:19.527 --> 48:24.484
Spy! Watching in the bushes,
you vile nasty child!

48:24.484 --> 48:26.141
- I didn't do anything! - Liar!

48:26.403 --> 48:27.330
Dell...

48:27.587 --> 48:30.585
Spy... with your little spies!

48:30.817 --> 48:31.710
No!

48:32.160 --> 48:34.548
You'll starve now, you hear me?

48:34.782 --> 48:37.203
No more food for you! No more you!

48:37.438 --> 48:42.836
Dell, no, Dell!

48:47.287 --> 48:49.839
Now. Who have we here?

48:51.029 --> 48:52.403
It's Mustique!

48:52.629 --> 48:53.938
A troublesome creature.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.978
- She's mine! I hate you!
- I don't think so. No, no, no.

49:00.337 --> 49:03.270
Now look at what you done.
Look at what you done now!

49:04.718 --> 49:05.928
All right.

49:06.158 --> 49:08.328
All right, my boy.

49:08.556 --> 49:11.369
- Dell's here. Dell's got...
- Leave him alone!

49:11.595 --> 49:13.633
- Leave him! Witch!
- Get off me!

49:13.834 --> 49:15.240
Leave him!

49:20.869 --> 49:22.210
Mama.

49:24.707 --> 49:26.975
I've got your hat, you witch!

49:27.202 --> 49:29.372
Now you'll get stung by bees and die.

49:29.601 --> 49:32.349
You'll die.
And get out in the earth and die!

49:32.576 --> 49:33.590
Mama.

49:54.484 --> 49:55.563
You're gonna die now!

50:04.846 --> 50:07.212
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

50:07.596 --> 50:09.734
I didn't do anything!

50:11.690 --> 50:14.591
She's got them all, daddy. I'm next.

50:14.793 --> 50:18.403
When she finds the squirrel gone
she'll destroy me for sure.

50:19.238 --> 50:23.131
Probably she'll hang my head
in her living room!

50:30.528 --> 50:33.941
You're dreaming yourself
far away, daddy.

50:35.229 --> 50:38.043
Further than the Hundred Years Ocean.

50:40.379 --> 50:42.265
Beyond Jutland...

50:43.001 --> 50:47.254
deep, deep, deep...
in the place where dreams are made.

50:49.909 --> 50:51.763
We'll be a happy family.

50:53.715 --> 50:57.161
We'll build a castle of crooked branches...

50:57.841 --> 50:59.727
and flattened pennies.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.475
Eat meat...

51:03.023 --> 51:06.883
and butter tarts... and drink lemonade...

51:07.117 --> 51:10.017
from gold-plated paper cups.

51:13.449 --> 51:15.782
I'll dream myself there too.

51:16.871 --> 51:20.927
If I shut my eyes and try hard enough...

51:21.861 --> 51:24.925
maybe I'll wake inside your dream.

51:46.839 --> 51:48.845
The end of the world.

53:27.297 --> 53:28.409
Dickens!

53:31.614 --> 53:36.151
You killed it!
You killed the monster shark, Dickens!

53:38.010 --> 53:39.602
I love you.

53:51.731 --> 53:52.745
Little girl.

53:54.610 --> 53:55.951
Are you hurt?

53:56.752 --> 53:58.573
Are you okay, little girl?

54:02.349 --> 54:04.355
I'm hungry is all.

54:07.339 --> 54:10.054
Well, here... I have something.

54:17.605 --> 54:20.985
Are you traveling alone
or with someone?

54:22.531 --> 54:23.675
Don't know.

54:25.601 --> 54:27.901
I guess Dickens will come and get me.

54:28.319 --> 54:30.140
I'm pretty sure he will.

54:33.277 --> 54:35.610
So your parents weren't on the train?

54:40.536 --> 54:42.543
You're all alone like me then.

54:44.407 --> 54:46.032
It happened so fast.

54:46.805 --> 54:48.233
So fast.

54:49.108 --> 54:52.271
We're two of the lucky ones...
thank God.

54:54.225 --> 54:57.038
Very, very lucky.

54:58.096 --> 55:02.468
Dickens? Dickens?

55:04.012 --> 55:05.571
Dickens?

55:06.731 --> 55:09.097
- You stay far. - Dickens?

55:09.481 --> 55:11.236
Mess elsewhere.

55:11.432 --> 55:13.154
Dickens?

55:13.447 --> 55:17.755
Where are you, boy? Dickens?

55:19.588 --> 55:21.474
My captain.

55:21.986 --> 55:24.123
It's okay. It's okay.

55:26.464 --> 55:28.024
We're safe now.

55:31.485 --> 55:33.818
We'll take care of each other,
how's that?

55:34.908 --> 55:37.623
And I'll make sure you get
where you're going.

55:58.766 --> 56:01.928
They're beautiful. Aren't they?

56:06.922 --> 56:09.060
They're my friends, you know.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.002
They have names.
