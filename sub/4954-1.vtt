01:24.544 --> 01:26.796
- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?

01:26.880 --> 01:31.718
I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?

01:31.843 --> 01:35.388
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.558
Hey, hey, little boy.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.977
- Excuse me, girls. Girls.
- Take the witches!

01:41.060 --> 01:43.188
Hey. Hey, big fella.
Excuse me.

01:43.313 --> 01:45.598
Come help me make up these
beds in the living room!

01:45.624 --> 01:46.633
Excuse me. Ma'am!

01:46.733 --> 01:49.110
- Hi. Hey, son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

01:49.235 --> 01:52.739
Big fella! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

01:54.365 --> 01:57.202
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh, it's crazy.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.579
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

01:59.662 --> 02:01.706
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.708
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.752
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?

02:05.877 --> 02:10.590
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie, but the big kids can.

02:10.715 --> 02:13.468
- Why can't I?
- Kevin, I'm on the phone.

02:13.593 --> 02:16.054
When do you come back?
Not till then?

02:16.179 --> 02:19.516
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.852
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

02:22.936 --> 02:25.146
then it must be really bad.

02:25.271 --> 02:27.398
No, we're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him...

02:27.482 --> 02:29.943
Hey, hey, hey! Get off.
Kevin, out of the room.

02:30.026 --> 02:32.445
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't ya?

02:32.529 --> 02:33.313
Oh, this kid.

02:33.339 --> 02:36.474
Kate, did you by any chance pick
up a voltage adapter thing?

02:36.533 --> 02:38.451
I didn't have time to do that.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.453
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

02:40.537 --> 02:43.456
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.458
I've got something
for you to do.

02:45.542 --> 02:48.002
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.964
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

02:51.089 --> 02:53.071
He was in the garage again
playing with the glue gun.

02:53.097 --> 02:54.158
Didn't we talk about that?

02:54.259 --> 02:57.262
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.514
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

02:59.639 --> 03:01.391
My new fishhooks?

03:01.474 --> 03:06.229
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones,
with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

03:06.312 --> 03:10.191
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.777
Peter, Kate, do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

03:12.902 --> 03:16.114
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- Oh, you're getting heavy.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.366
Go pack your suitcase.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.620
Pack my suitcase?

03:22.745 --> 03:25.265
- Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?
- I don't live here.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.750
A house with this many people,
there's no shampoo?

03:27.834 --> 03:30.115
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah, but they don't live here.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.797
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

03:32.881 --> 03:36.176
- Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here?
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.178
- Hi!
- Hi!

03:38.261 --> 03:39.804
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.848
- Do they live here?
- No.

03:41.931 --> 03:46.895
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

03:47.020 --> 03:51.065
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

03:51.191 --> 03:53.443
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

03:53.526 --> 03:56.237
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin, "tough."

03:56.362 --> 03:59.073
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

03:59.199 --> 04:01.659
Shake his hand and say,
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

04:01.743 --> 04:04.704
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh, really? You're completely helpless!

04:04.787 --> 04:07.498
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right, Kev.

04:07.582 --> 04:11.461
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you.
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

04:11.544 --> 04:15.131
- I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.
- Shut up, Linnie.

04:15.215 --> 04:17.132
Do you know what I should pack?

04:17.216 --> 04:20.553
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

04:20.637 --> 04:23.556
Listen, Kev, what are
you so worried about?

04:23.681 --> 04:26.434
You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.771
You're what the French call
les incompetents.

04:29.896 --> 04:33.858
- What?
- Bombs away!

04:37.570 --> 04:41.908
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

04:41.991 --> 04:45.745
If he has something to drink,
he's gonna wet the bed.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.623
This house is so full of people,
it makes me sick!

04:48.748 --> 04:51.751
When I grow up and get married,
I'm livin' alone!

04:51.876 --> 04:54.671
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

04:54.754 --> 04:57.507
I'm livin' alone!

04:59.968 --> 05:02.262
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

05:02.387 --> 05:06.766
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

05:08.142 --> 05:11.437
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

05:11.521 --> 05:14.190
Some don't.

05:14.274 --> 05:16.192
But they got nude beaches.

05:16.276 --> 05:19.320
Not in the winter.

05:23.783 --> 05:27.745
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

05:27.871 --> 05:31.374
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.459
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

05:33.543 --> 05:38.173
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

05:40.133 --> 05:43.136
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.641
Who is he?

05:48.766 --> 05:53.104
You ever heard
of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!

05:53.188 --> 05:55.148
- No.
- That's him.

05:55.231 --> 05:59.986
Back in '58, he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

06:01.321 --> 06:03.448
with a snow shovel.

06:03.573 --> 06:06.868
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

06:06.993 --> 06:10.455
Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

06:10.580 --> 06:12.498
Not enough evidence to convict.

06:12.582 --> 06:15.126
They never found the bodies.

06:15.251 --> 06:17.462
But everyone around here
knows he did it.

06:17.587 --> 06:21.299
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.384
What's he doin' now?

06:23.510 --> 06:27.430
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

06:27.514 --> 06:29.849
salting the sidewalks.

06:29.933 --> 06:31.893
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.855
No way.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.983
See that garbage can full of salt?

06:39.108 --> 06:42.070
That's where he keeps his victims.

06:42.195 --> 06:45.073
The salt turns the bodies...

06:45.198 --> 06:47.992
into mummies.

06:48.076 --> 06:51.037
- Wow.
- Mummies.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.418
Look out!

07:29.033 --> 07:31.995
How you kids doin', huh? Good?

07:32.078 --> 07:34.789
Lot of action
around here today, huh?

07:34.914 --> 07:37.584
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

07:37.709 --> 07:42.005
Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?

07:42.088 --> 07:44.174
Where you goin', kid?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.519
Okay, that's 122.50.

07:56.603 --> 07:58.605
Not for me, kid.
I don't live here.

07:58.688 --> 08:02.650
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

08:02.775 --> 08:06.112
- Hey, pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.865
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

08:08.948 --> 08:12.202
Hey, listen, uh...

08:12.285 --> 08:15.705
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

08:15.788 --> 08:18.124
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

08:18.249 --> 08:21.252
- Yes.
- Oh, good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

08:21.377 --> 08:24.881
- I'd like a word with you, sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

08:24.964 --> 08:28.801
No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

08:28.927 --> 08:33.306
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

08:33.389 --> 08:37.519
Oh, yeah. Well, we have automatic timers
for our lights, locks for our doors.

08:37.644 --> 08:39.729
That's about as well
as anybody can do these days.

08:39.812 --> 08:42.023
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on, Dad.

08:42.148 --> 08:44.025
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.382
- Eggnog? Listen, are you
gonna be leaving, uh...

08:46.408 --> 08:47.136
- Pizza! Pizza!

08:47.237 --> 08:49.155
Pizza!

08:49.322 --> 08:52.325
Grab yourself a napkin.
You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.536
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

08:54.661 --> 08:56.871
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

08:56.996 --> 08:59.457
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

08:59.582 --> 09:03.795
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

09:03.878 --> 09:07.056
Honey, the pizza boy needs
$122.50, plus a tip.

09:07.082 --> 09:08.074
For pizza?

09:08.174 --> 09:10.009
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

09:10.093 --> 09:12.637
- Frank, you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.598
Forget it, Frank.
We have cash.

09:15.682 --> 09:18.351
You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.

09:18.476 --> 09:21.437
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

09:21.521 --> 09:23.982
Oh, yeah, we did.
But if you want any...

09:24.065 --> 09:27.318
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up, 'cause it's gone.

09:27.443 --> 09:30.947
Fuller!
Go easy on the Pepsi.

09:37.495 --> 09:41.124
Kev! Kevin, get a plate.

09:47.797 --> 09:50.049
Wow!

09:50.175 --> 09:52.969
The passports! Watch it!

09:53.052 --> 09:56.181
Help me out here!

09:56.306 --> 09:59.100
Let's get these passports
out of here.

09:59.225 --> 10:02.687
- Kevin, get off of him!
- You moron!

10:02.812 --> 10:06.357
Are you okay, honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

10:06.482 --> 10:08.234
What is the matter with you?

10:08.359 --> 10:11.237
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.615
He knows I hate sausage
and olives and...

10:13.740 --> 10:16.159
Look what you did,
you little jerk!

10:30.215 --> 10:32.300
- Kevin, get upstairs right now.
- Why?

10:32.425 --> 10:35.637
- Kevin, you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

10:35.762 --> 10:37.472
- Kevin, upstairs!
- Say good night, Kevin.

10:37.597 --> 10:41.851
- Good night, Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

10:41.935 --> 10:44.270
Why do I always get treated
like scum?

10:44.354 --> 10:46.731
Oh, I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.733
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

10:48.816 --> 10:52.487
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

10:52.612 --> 10:55.198
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

10:55.281 --> 10:57.325
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.869
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

10:59.953 --> 11:01.871
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

11:01.955 --> 11:05.875
and his kids are still going to school here,
and I guess he missed the whole family.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.586
He's giving us this trip to Paris
so we can be together.

11:08.711 --> 11:12.465
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.843
Excellent. Excellent.

11:14.968 --> 11:18.096
If you'll excuse me, this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

11:18.221 --> 11:21.015
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband already.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.309
And don't worry
about your home.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.812
It's in good hands.

11:28.648 --> 11:32.151
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

11:32.277 --> 11:35.321
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

11:35.446 --> 11:40.034
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs, dummy.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.704
- The third floor?
- Go.

11:42.829 --> 11:46.040
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.335
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.629
He'll pee all over me.
I know it.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.756
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.384
I'm sorry.

11:56.509 --> 11:59.012
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.100
Everyone in this family hates me.

12:04.184 --> 12:06.436
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

12:06.519 --> 12:10.190
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

12:10.315 --> 12:13.484
Stay up there. I don't want to
see you for the rest of the night.

12:13.610 --> 12:16.237
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

12:16.362 --> 12:19.032
And I don't want to see
anybody else either.

12:19.157 --> 12:21.117
I hope you don't mean that.

12:21.201 --> 12:25.163
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

12:25.288 --> 12:28.791
- No, I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.

12:28.875 --> 12:33.296
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.445
I wish they would all just disappear.

13:54.294 --> 13:57.630
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

14:06.055 --> 14:09.475
Peter!

14:09.559 --> 14:11.519
We slept in!

14:28.286 --> 14:31.289
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

14:31.414 --> 14:34.834
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando, Florida.

14:34.918 --> 14:38.588
Well, actually, first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

14:38.671 --> 14:41.257
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

14:41.341 --> 14:45.136
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

14:45.220 --> 14:48.181
Gee, kid, I don't know.
Hit the road.

14:51.017 --> 14:53.186
Heather, do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

14:53.311 --> 14:55.188
Where are the passports
and tickets?

14:55.313 --> 14:57.190
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

14:57.315 --> 14:59.192
How fast does this thing go?

14:59.317 --> 15:03.238
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

15:03.363 --> 15:07.534
Look, I told you before, kid,
don't bother me. Now beat it.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.960
Come on. Hurry up.

15:18.711 --> 15:22.549
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

15:22.632 --> 15:25.009
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

15:25.093 --> 15:27.762
Shut up.
I gotta take a head count.

15:27.887 --> 15:31.975
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Eleven, 92, 12.

15:32.058 --> 15:34.477
Buzz, don't be a moron.

15:34.561 --> 15:37.772
Six, seven, eight...

15:37.897 --> 15:40.441
nine, 10, 11.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.736
Okay. Half in this van, half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.364
Have a good trip.

15:46.489 --> 15:48.491
Bring me back something French.

15:51.244 --> 15:55.164
There's no way on earth we're gonna
make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

15:55.248 --> 15:58.585
- Think positive, Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

15:58.668 --> 16:00.587
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

16:00.670 --> 16:02.672
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

16:02.755 --> 16:06.259
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

16:06.384 --> 16:08.803
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay, thanks.

16:08.928 --> 16:12.265
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven, including me.

16:12.348 --> 16:17.145
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

16:49.969 --> 16:51.846
This way!

16:51.971 --> 16:55.433
- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?

16:55.558 --> 16:58.102
No, you just made it.

16:58.228 --> 17:02.315
- Single seats only in coach. Take whatever's free.
- Thank you.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.608
I get a window seat!

17:06.986 --> 17:09.030
You kids are in coach.
We're up here.

17:09.155 --> 17:11.866
Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B"
and four "A"and "B."

17:11.991 --> 17:14.868
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.871
Fasten your seat belts, please.

17:16.996 --> 17:19.540
- Champagne, please. It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

17:19.665 --> 17:23.294
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

17:23.377 --> 17:25.547
Hope we didn't forget anything.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.927
What are you doing
out of costume?

18:13.052 --> 18:14.929
Now get back and get dressed.

18:15.054 --> 18:17.215
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

18:17.223 --> 18:19.142
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

18:19.225 --> 18:21.352
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

18:21.477 --> 18:24.522
It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man...

18:29.944 --> 18:32.697
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!

18:32.780 --> 18:36.451
But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.453
I ought to take this cane and...

18:38.578 --> 18:43.166
Julia, get some black
coffee and plenty of it.

18:43.249 --> 18:45.210
Black with a little cream.

18:45.293 --> 18:47.504
Mom?

18:52.509 --> 18:55.261
Thank you.

18:55.386 --> 18:58.556
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

18:58.681 --> 19:02.894
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

19:03.019 --> 19:04.938
Put them in your purse!

19:05.021 --> 19:09.150
Uh, yeah, yeah, fill it up, fill it up.
Fill it up, please.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.152
Thank you.

19:11.277 --> 19:14.656
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

19:14.781 --> 19:16.658
No, the kids are fine.

19:16.783 --> 19:20.912
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the
family station wagon, and it wasn't to France.

19:20.995 --> 19:24.332
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

19:24.457 --> 19:26.738
The kids are okay. They're
having the time of their lives.

19:26.752 --> 19:27.318
Yeah.

19:28.419 --> 19:30.380
Hello?

19:31.548 --> 19:33.508
Mom?

19:35.301 --> 19:37.262
Dad?

19:40.640 --> 19:43.393
Mom? Dad?

19:45.436 --> 19:48.147
Where are you guys?

19:48.273 --> 19:50.233
Buzz?

19:51.651 --> 19:53.611
Buzz?

19:56.614 --> 19:58.575
Buzz?

20:02.328 --> 20:04.205
Megan?

20:04.330 --> 20:08.877
Hello? Hello?

20:09.002 --> 20:11.963
Rod? Uncle Frank?

20:12.088 --> 20:14.382
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

20:16.259 --> 20:19.179
Megan? Linnie?

20:21.806 --> 20:23.766
Is this a joke?

20:46.998 --> 20:51.461
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

21:08.561 --> 21:12.065
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

21:29.999 --> 21:33.753
I made my family disappear.

21:34.879 --> 21:37.048
Kevin, you're completely helpless.

21:37.131 --> 21:41.719
You know, Kevin, you're what
the French call les incompetents.

21:41.803 --> 21:45.056
Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.

21:45.139 --> 21:48.142
Kevin, you are such a disease.

21:48.268 --> 21:50.436
There are 15 people
in this house...

21:50.562 --> 21:53.356
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

21:53.439 --> 21:56.776
Look what you did,
you little jerk.

22:00.613 --> 22:03.741
I made my family disappear.

22:18.089 --> 22:22.135
I'm free! Free! Free!

22:32.061 --> 22:34.022
Wow!

22:39.986 --> 22:43.698
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

22:43.823 --> 22:47.952
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

22:48.077 --> 22:51.039
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff!

22:51.164 --> 22:54.083
You better come out
and pound me!

22:57.420 --> 23:00.673
Buzz, your girlfriend!
Woof!

23:49.472 --> 23:51.432
Who is it?

23:54.894 --> 23:57.814
It's me, Snakes.
I got the stuff.

23:57.897 --> 24:01.025
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

24:01.109 --> 24:04.320
All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?

24:04.404 --> 24:07.949
- What money?
- Acey said you had some dough for me.

24:08.074 --> 24:11.035
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?

24:11.160 --> 24:13.997
Acey said 10%.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.791
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

24:16.916 --> 24:19.794
- What do you mean?
- Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

24:19.919 --> 24:22.881
You better come out
and stop me!

24:22.964 --> 24:25.592
He'll call you when he gets out.

24:25.717 --> 24:27.385
Hey.

24:27.510 --> 24:30.221
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you, Snakes.

24:31.890 --> 24:34.142
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

24:34.267 --> 24:37.353
to get your ugly, yellow...

24:37.437 --> 24:39.564
no-good keister off my property...

24:39.689 --> 24:41.774
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.444
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

24:44.569 --> 24:47.071
One, two, ten!

25:02.378 --> 25:04.797
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

25:06.466 --> 25:08.009
Mom!

25:19.354 --> 25:21.940
What's the matter?

25:22.023 --> 25:24.442
Honey?

25:24.526 --> 25:28.071
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

25:29.155 --> 25:31.282
That we didn't do something.

25:31.407 --> 25:34.702
Oh, no, you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

25:34.827 --> 25:36.855
We took care of everything.
Believe me, we did.

25:36.881 --> 25:38.189
Did I turn off the coffee?

25:38.248 --> 25:41.125
No. I did.

25:41.209 --> 25:43.211
Did you lock up?

25:43.336 --> 25:45.213
Yeah.

25:45.338 --> 25:47.966
Did you close the garage?

25:50.009 --> 25:53.805
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

25:59.394 --> 26:01.729
No, that's not it.

26:02.897 --> 26:05.108
What else could we be forgetting?

26:09.028 --> 26:11.239
Kevin!

26:37.515 --> 26:40.143
Whoa!

26:41.186 --> 26:44.939
Whoa! Whoa!

26:53.698 --> 26:56.868
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

26:56.993 --> 27:01.414
We'll call as soon as we land, Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

27:01.497 --> 27:05.126
It's horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.

27:05.251 --> 27:08.296
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

27:08.421 --> 27:10.673
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

27:11.841 --> 27:14.052
What kind of mother am I?

27:14.177 --> 27:17.889
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

27:22.602 --> 27:25.230
Five families gone on one block alone.

27:25.355 --> 27:28.233
- They all told me from their own mouths.

27:28.316 --> 27:30.276
It's almost too easy.

27:30.401 --> 27:34.280
Check it out. All the houses
with nobody home...

27:34.364 --> 27:37.492
have automatic timers
on their lights.

27:37.617 --> 27:40.453
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.458
Number 664 will be going on...

27:45.583 --> 27:48.795
right about... now.

27:50.547 --> 27:53.591
- Oh.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:53.716 --> 27:56.261
Number 672...

27:57.554 --> 28:00.223
right... now.

28:00.306 --> 28:03.518
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

28:03.643 --> 28:07.856
671... now.

28:09.983 --> 28:13.319
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

28:13.444 --> 28:15.572
Oh, it's very "G."

28:15.655 --> 28:18.616
Very "G, " huh?
It's loaded.

28:18.700 --> 28:21.160
It's got lots of topflight goods.

28:21.244 --> 28:24.664
- Stereos, VCR's.
- Toys.

28:24.789 --> 28:29.252
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

28:29.335 --> 28:33.590
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

28:33.673 --> 28:35.884
It's a gem.

28:36.009 --> 28:37.969
Grab your crowbar.

28:39.220 --> 28:41.181
Crowbars up.

29:40.156 --> 29:40.965
Which way?

29:40.991 --> 29:44.227
We'll go around back to the basement.
Follow me.

30:04.097 --> 30:06.182
I thought you said
they were gone.

30:06.266 --> 30:10.103
- They were supposed to leave this morning.
- Let's get out of here.

30:46.639 --> 30:49.184
We have to use the phone, please.

30:49.309 --> 30:52.061
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

30:52.145 --> 30:55.190
Please! Our brother's home alone.

30:55.315 --> 30:58.526
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

30:58.651 --> 31:01.613
Peter, I'm gonna call the police.
Why don't you book us a flight home.

31:01.738 --> 31:06.367
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

31:06.492 --> 31:09.662
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.

31:09.787 --> 31:11.664
Maybe somebody can help us.

31:11.789 --> 31:15.877
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

31:21.007 --> 31:24.928
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

31:25.011 --> 31:29.140
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

31:36.439 --> 31:39.317
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

31:40.777 --> 31:44.739
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

31:44.864 --> 31:47.700
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore!

32:18.690 --> 32:20.650
Village Police Department.

32:20.733 --> 32:24.279
Hi. Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

32:24.404 --> 32:27.782
Our phones are out of order,
so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

32:27.907 --> 32:29.784
and tell him we're
coming home to get him.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.953
Let me connect you with
Family Crisis Intervention.

32:32.078 --> 32:34.914
- It's not a family crisis.
- Hold on.

32:36.791 --> 32:40.295
Larry, can you pick up? There's some
lady on hold, sounds kind of hyper.

32:40.420 --> 32:43.131
- What line, Rose?
- Uh, two.

32:43.256 --> 32:45.842
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.928
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

32:49.053 --> 32:50.930
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

32:51.055 --> 32:53.850
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

32:53.933 --> 32:57.896
- No.
- Has he been involved in a household accident?

32:58.021 --> 33:00.231
I don't know. I don't...
I hope not.

33:00.356 --> 33:02.817
Has the child ingested any poison...

33:02.942 --> 33:05.612
and/or any other object that has become
lodged in his throat?

33:05.737 --> 33:09.324
No, he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

33:09.449 --> 33:12.285
and see that he's all right,
just to check on him.

33:12.368 --> 33:15.997
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

33:16.122 --> 33:16.806
Yes!

33:16.832 --> 33:19.567
Let me connect you with
the police department.

33:19.626 --> 33:22.128
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

33:22.253 --> 33:24.672
- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on, please.

33:24.797 --> 33:28.718
No, please don't hang up.
Please, don't... Any luck?

33:28.801 --> 33:32.430
No. We couldn't get anybody.

33:32.555 --> 33:33.314
Leslie?

33:33.340 --> 33:36.376
I'm sorry, Kate. Nothing but a
bunch of answering machines.

33:38.603 --> 33:42.232
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

33:42.315 --> 33:44.859
- Hi, ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah, hi. Look.

33:44.984 --> 33:47.820
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I...

33:47.946 --> 33:51.908
Okay, okay. We'll send a policeman
over to your house to check on your son.

34:22.146 --> 34:24.815
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

34:24.899 --> 34:27.985
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
Ten-four.

34:28.110 --> 34:30.655
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody...

34:30.780 --> 34:33.449
I'm sorry, but there's
no way I can do that.

34:33.533 --> 34:35.451
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

34:35.534 --> 34:38.079
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could...

34:38.204 --> 34:40.724
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

34:40.790 --> 34:45.085
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
- There's nothing to Chicago?

34:45.210 --> 34:48.505
There's nothing to Chicago, New York,
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

34:48.630 --> 34:53.052
- What about a private plane?
- No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

34:53.136 --> 34:56.139
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

34:56.222 --> 34:58.474
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

34:58.558 --> 35:01.060
Look, honey, the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

35:01.144 --> 35:03.771
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

35:03.897 --> 35:07.984
I say we go to Rob's, we can call the
police, and they can get back to us.

35:08.067 --> 35:11.905
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

35:11.988 --> 35:13.907
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

35:13.990 --> 35:17.911
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on a standby.

35:18.036 --> 35:21.456
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

35:21.581 --> 35:24.667
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

35:29.756 --> 35:33.384
- Bye. I'll miss you.
- Bye.

35:33.468 --> 35:36.429
- Find Kevin.

35:36.554 --> 35:38.515
Don't you get lost.

35:38.598 --> 35:40.725
Good-bye.

35:40.850 --> 35:42.769
Good-bye, Kate.

35:56.616 --> 36:00.119
I took a shower, washing
every body part with actual soap...

36:00.245 --> 36:04.749
including all my major crevices, including
in between my toes and in my belly button...

36:04.832 --> 36:07.293
which I never did before,
but sort of enjoyed.

36:07.418 --> 36:10.046
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

36:10.129 --> 36:13.299
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

36:13.424 --> 36:17.428
I can't seem to find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

36:17.512 --> 36:19.556
Other than that,
I'm in good shape.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.842
Whoa!

37:09.772 --> 37:12.984
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

37:40.136 --> 37:43.014
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

37:58.905 --> 38:02.450
You know, you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world, Marv.

38:02.575 --> 38:04.575
You think you could keep
it down a little in there?

38:05.245 --> 38:10.041
Hi, you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.

38:10.124 --> 38:14.921
Chuck, this is Peter McCallister again, and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

38:15.046 --> 38:18.132
Let me give you the number here, okay?
The country code is 3-3.

38:18.258 --> 38:20.134
The area code is 1-4.

38:20.260 --> 38:24.472
- And the number is 694-8764.
- Hey, Harry?

38:24.597 --> 38:25.390
Yeah?

38:25.416 --> 38:28.585
House we were at last night,
was that the McCallisters?

38:28.685 --> 38:31.104
- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.

38:31.229 --> 38:33.773
You're right. They're gone.

38:37.193 --> 38:40.029
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

38:42.198 --> 38:44.158
Wow.

38:49.289 --> 38:51.249
How may I help you?

38:51.374 --> 38:55.211
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

38:55.295 --> 38:58.089
Well, I don't know.

38:58.214 --> 39:01.968
- It doesn't say, hon.
- Can you please find out?

39:04.971 --> 39:06.973
- Herb!
- Yeah?

39:07.098 --> 39:10.894
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

39:16.441 --> 39:20.737
Do you know, is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

39:20.820 --> 39:22.739
I don't know.

39:43.593 --> 39:48.014
- Just tell him that...
- Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

39:48.097 --> 39:50.016
Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?

39:50.099 --> 39:53.436
Wait, son, you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?

39:53.520 --> 39:55.522
Son! Hey!

39:55.605 --> 39:59.317
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

40:02.779 --> 40:06.074
Hey! Hey!

40:08.034 --> 40:09.786
Shoplifter!

40:13.039 --> 40:14.874
Hey! Hey, kid!

40:14.999 --> 40:17.585
Come back here!

40:17.710 --> 40:20.421
Watch it!

40:21.798 --> 40:23.591
Come back here!

40:23.716 --> 40:27.595
Stop it, will ya!
Come here!

40:30.223 --> 40:32.392
Whoa! Whoa!

40:34.060 --> 40:37.397
Whoa! Whoa!

40:39.732 --> 40:42.360
Yeehaw!

41:06.217 --> 41:08.178
I'm a criminal.

41:35.371 --> 41:38.082
What's so funny?

41:38.166 --> 41:40.835
What's so funny?
What are you laughin' at?

41:43.463 --> 41:45.465
You did it again, didn't you?

41:45.548 --> 41:48.218
You left the water runnin', didn't you?

41:48.301 --> 41:51.513
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

41:51.638 --> 41:53.515
Harry, it's our calling card.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.351
- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.

41:56.476 --> 41:58.353
We're the "Wet Bandits."

41:58.478 --> 42:01.314
You're sick, you know that?
You're really sick.

42:01.439 --> 42:03.316
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

42:03.441 --> 42:05.360
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

42:12.116 --> 42:14.802
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.

42:14.828 --> 42:16.145
I can do it if I want to.

42:16.246 --> 42:18.998
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

42:19.123 --> 42:22.210
- Hey, watch out!

42:28.716 --> 42:32.303
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic, son, you know?

42:32.428 --> 42:34.848
- Sorry.
- Damn.

42:34.931 --> 42:37.183
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, little buddy.

42:37.308 --> 42:39.477
Okay, okay.

42:39.602 --> 42:42.897
Merry Christmas.

42:52.323 --> 42:55.702
- What's the matter?
- I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

42:55.785 --> 42:57.704
- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?

42:57.787 --> 43:00.498
I saw a hundred kids this week.

43:00.623 --> 43:03.084
Let's see what house
he goes into.

43:34.741 --> 43:36.993
Why is he goin' faster?

43:37.076 --> 43:41.497
I told you something's wrong. I knew
he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

44:16.908 --> 44:20.954
- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.

44:21.079 --> 44:23.831
- Me neither.
- Ah, let's get out of here.

44:42.475 --> 44:45.603
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

45:11.296 --> 45:13.840
- Did they come back?
- From Paris?

45:49.542 --> 45:52.462
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone by then.

45:52.545 --> 45:56.633
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees us.

46:25.370 --> 46:27.539
Attention! Attention!

46:27.622 --> 46:31.584
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen!
- Frank, those are for later.

46:31.668 --> 46:33.628
Frank?

46:35.046 --> 46:38.883
Mes petites enfants,
do you want a little shrimp, eh?

46:39.008 --> 46:42.220
Oper... Do you speak English?

46:42.345 --> 46:45.139
Parlez anglais?

46:45.265 --> 46:47.225
Is there... I mean...

46:47.308 --> 46:52.272
Est ce qui un person
qui parle anglais?

46:52.355 --> 46:55.400
- Did you get anybody?
- I'm looking for my son! Do you know where he is?

46:55.525 --> 47:00.822
I can't find anybody. They've all gone
shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

47:00.947 --> 47:03.032
Never mind. Forget it.

47:03.116 --> 47:05.159
This is so pointless.

47:05.285 --> 47:08.997
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

47:09.122 --> 47:11.291
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

47:11.416 --> 47:13.710
- So?
- You're not at all worried about Kevin?

47:13.793 --> 47:15.712
Why should I be?

47:15.795 --> 47:19.340
He's acted like a jerk too many times,
and this time he caught it in the butt.

47:19.465 --> 47:23.970
But he's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

47:24.095 --> 47:27.265
The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.

47:27.390 --> 47:29.726
You're not worried that something
might happen to him?

47:29.809 --> 47:32.312
No. For three reasons.

47:32.395 --> 47:35.023
I'm not that lucky.

47:35.148 --> 47:37.442
Two: We have smoke detectors.

47:37.525 --> 47:41.487
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America...

47:41.613 --> 47:45.992
where nothing even remotely dangerous
will ever happen, period.

48:13.144 --> 48:16.523
- Who is it?
- It's Little Nero's, sir. I have your pizza.

48:16.648 --> 48:19.817
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

48:19.943 --> 48:22.695
Okay.

48:22.820 --> 48:24.989
Um, well, what about the money?

48:26.199 --> 48:27.825
What money?

48:27.951 --> 48:31.371
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

48:31.454 --> 48:33.665
Is that a fact?

48:33.790 --> 48:35.959
How much do I owe you?

48:36.042 --> 48:39.337
Uh, that'll be 11.80, sir.

48:45.718 --> 48:49.055
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

48:50.932 --> 48:52.851
- Cheapskate.
- Hey.

48:52.934 --> 48:56.729
I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly...

48:56.855 --> 49:00.149
yellow, no-good keister
off my property...

49:00.233 --> 49:02.443
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

49:02.569 --> 49:04.445
One, two, ten!

49:33.433 --> 49:36.436
A lovely cheese pizza
just for me.

49:39.939 --> 49:42.108
To Dallas-Fort Worth.

49:45.528 --> 49:47.906
We have the $500,
the pocket translator...

49:47.989 --> 49:50.700
the two first-class seats...
that's an upgrade from your coach...

49:50.783 --> 49:54.579
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

49:54.704 --> 49:57.373
- No.
- But who can tell?

49:57.457 --> 50:01.419
- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!

50:01.544 --> 50:04.047
Come on. They're boarding.

50:04.130 --> 50:07.634
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

50:07.759 --> 50:11.262
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...

50:11.387 --> 50:14.098
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

50:14.224 --> 50:16.851
A whole shoe box full of' em.
Dangley ones.

50:16.976 --> 50:18.937
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...

50:19.062 --> 50:21.064
I'm desperate.

50:21.147 --> 50:23.024
I'm begging you.

50:23.149 --> 50:26.569
From a mother to a mother, please.

50:28.071 --> 50:30.657
- Oh, Ed.
- Please.

50:30.782 --> 50:33.451
Oh, all right.

50:39.123 --> 50:41.125
"Dear Santa Claus.
I got a little sister last year.

50:41.251 --> 50:43.419
This year I'd rather
have some clay dough."

50:57.517 --> 50:59.435
I didn't mean it.

50:59.519 --> 51:02.689
If you come back,
I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

51:02.814 --> 51:05.775
I promise. Good night.

- I'll give 'em a whirl.

52:57.720 --> 52:59.848
For the kids.

53:02.183 --> 53:04.769
Hold on.
I got a coupon for that.

53:04.894 --> 53:07.564
It was in the paper this morning.

53:11.150 --> 53:13.987
- 19.83.
- Okay.

53:17.490 --> 53:19.617
Are you here all by yourself?

53:21.160 --> 53:25.248
Ma'am, I'm eight years old.
You think I would be here alone?

53:25.331 --> 53:27.667
I don't think so.

53:27.792 --> 53:30.044
- Where's your mom?
- My mom's in the car.

53:30.170 --> 53:32.547
- And where is your father?
- He's at work.

53:32.672 --> 53:35.425
- What about your brothers and your sisters?
- I'm an only child.

53:35.508 --> 53:38.011
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

53:38.136 --> 53:41.139
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

54:19.219 --> 54:23.014
Hello, Kevin!

54:24.307 --> 54:27.685
Shut up.

54:40.698 --> 54:42.575
I don't get it.

54:42.700 --> 54:45.370
I mean, right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

54:45.495 --> 54:49.040
Last night the place is jumpin'.

54:49.165 --> 54:52.877
Somethin' ain't right.
Go check it out.

55:01.469 --> 55:03.388
Now?

55:03.513 --> 55:05.390
No, tomorrow, egghead. Now!

55:05.515 --> 55:08.142
Go ahead!

55:08.226 --> 55:10.436
"Now?"

55:27.745 --> 55:30.123
Shit.

55:31.958 --> 55:34.878
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right, Johnny.

55:34.961 --> 55:38.089
- But what about my money?
- What money?

55:38.214 --> 55:40.884
Acey said you had
some dough for me.

55:41.009 --> 55:45.889
- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?
- Acey said 10%.

55:45.972 --> 55:50.977
- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?

55:51.102 --> 55:54.480
He's upstairs taking a bath.

55:54.606 --> 55:57.275
He'll call you when he gets out.

55:57.400 --> 55:59.277
Hey.

55:59.402 --> 56:02.405
I tell you what
I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

56:02.488 --> 56:06.326
- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

56:06.451 --> 56:08.745
to get your ugly, yellow...

56:08.828 --> 56:13.291
no-good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

56:13.374 --> 56:16.085
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

56:16.169 --> 56:19.130
One, two, ten!

56:38.358 --> 56:41.528
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

56:45.532 --> 56:46.408
What happened?

56:46.434 --> 56:49.936
I don't know who's in there, but
somebody just got blown away!

56:49.994 --> 56:50.495
- Huh?

56:50.521 --> 56:52.522
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

56:52.622 --> 56:56.626
Two of' em. They was arguing.
One of' em blew the other one away.

56:56.709 --> 56:58.419
- Who?
- I don't know.

56:58.503 --> 57:00.964
I thought I recognized
one of their voices.

57:01.047 --> 57:04.259
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

57:04.342 --> 57:06.845
Snakes? Snakes, Snakes.

57:06.970 --> 57:09.055
- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.

57:09.180 --> 57:11.724
Let's get out of here.

57:14.143 --> 57:16.813
Hold it, hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

57:16.896 --> 57:18.815
We work this neighborhood too.

57:18.898 --> 57:21.693
- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...

57:21.818 --> 57:24.821
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

57:24.904 --> 57:28.032
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with their questions?

57:29.909 --> 57:31.870
That's a good idea.

57:31.995 --> 57:35.415
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

57:35.540 --> 57:38.418
He sounded like a snake.

57:42.505 --> 57:45.592
Everything's full.

57:45.717 --> 57:47.594
Everything's full?

57:47.719 --> 57:49.929
I'm very sorry,
but it is Christmas Eve.

57:50.054 --> 57:52.182
What about another airline?

57:57.604 --> 58:00.565
Nothing available. May I help you
get a hotel room in the city?

58:00.690 --> 58:02.984
Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.

58:03.010 --> 58:04.219
I can't wait that long.

58:04.277 --> 58:08.698
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

58:12.869 --> 58:15.997
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go, people to see.

58:16.080 --> 58:19.417
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

58:19.542 --> 58:23.546
I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

58:23.630 --> 58:28.092
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to... Where the hell am I?

58:28.218 --> 58:30.220
Scranton.

58:30.303 --> 58:32.972
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

58:33.097 --> 58:36.476
And now that I'm this close,
you're telling me it's hopeless?

58:36.601 --> 58:40.230
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no, no way. This is Christmas!

58:40.313 --> 58:42.232
The season of perpetual hope!

58:42.315 --> 58:43.106
Ma'am, if I...

58:43.132 --> 58:46.135
If I have to get out on
your runway and hitchhike...

58:46.236 --> 58:48.154
if it costs me everything I own...

58:48.279 --> 58:51.115
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

58:51.241 --> 58:54.410
I am going to get home
to my son.

58:54.494 --> 58:57.797
Ma'am, if there was anything at
all I could do for you today...

58:57.823 --> 58:58.648
Do it.

58:58.748 --> 59:01.334
- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.

59:01.459 --> 59:03.878
- What?
- Excuse me.

59:03.962 --> 59:09.676
Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see
you for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.

59:09.801 --> 59:12.971
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

59:13.096 --> 59:15.682
We got a crisis ourselves.

59:15.807 --> 59:19.227
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

59:19.352 --> 59:22.772
Polka king of the Midwest?

59:25.650 --> 59:28.403
The Kenosha Kickers?

59:28.486 --> 59:30.154
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

59:30.280 --> 59:33.116
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized...

59:33.199 --> 59:36.160
Anyways, uh, I had
a few hits a few years ago.

59:36.244 --> 59:39.539
Uh, that's why, you know...
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

59:42.125 --> 59:44.127
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

59:44.210 --> 59:47.672
"Yamahoozie Polka,"
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

59:47.797 --> 59:50.425
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

59:50.508 --> 59:53.928
Yeah. Yeah. We...
Some fairly big hits for us.

59:54.012 --> 59:56.639
- You know, in the early '70s, you know?
- Oh.

59:56.723 --> 59:59.350
Yeah, we sold
about 623 copies of that.

59:59.475 --> 01:00:02.103
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

01:00:02.187 --> 01:00:04.355
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.608
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.

01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:09.777
Our flight was canceled,
so we gotta drive.

01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.448
So, uh, see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

01:00:13.531 --> 01:00:17.285
He's gonna rent us a nice big, uh, van,
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.

01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:21.664
I heard you had some problems here, uh, gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:25.877
Uh, my son. He...
We left and he's there.

01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:30.089
Aw, geez. If you have to get
to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you.

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:32.467
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.178
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not, you know?

01:00:35.303 --> 01:00:37.847
- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?

01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.807
Sure. You know,
it's Christmastime.

01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:42.435
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.854
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:46.856
No, I'd love to.

01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:11.464
- Hey, Marv, Marv, Marv.
- What?

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:14.050
Look at this.

01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:22.976
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:55.633
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

01:02:00.138 --> 01:02:04.392
Remember that kid we saw
the other day? He lives here.

01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:07.395
Well, if the kid's there,
the parents gotta be.

01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:10.064
He's home alone.

01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:20.283
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

01:02:20.366 --> 01:02:22.285
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

01:02:22.368 --> 01:02:24.495
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:28.082
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.877
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house, I wanted it.

01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:33.338
So let's take it
one step at a time, okay?

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:36.925
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:39.969
- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.

01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:43.181
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:46.142
You're afraid of the dark too, Marv.
You know you are.

01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:48.937
No, I'm not!

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.523
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not, not, not.

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:55.860
- You are so.
- Mom, where are you?

01:03:09.249 --> 01:03:11.167
Do you play?

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.336
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:15.672
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:17.841
Okay.

01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:45.493
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:49.581
- Hey, nice shoes.
- Oh, thanks.

01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:53.334
Is he still here? It's really important
that I see him.

01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:58.715
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry, you can catch him.

01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:03.261
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris
Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

01:04:03.386 --> 01:04:06.472
What's next?
Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

01:04:06.598 --> 01:04:09.184
Santa, hold on!

01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:11.394
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:04:11.477 --> 01:04:14.480
If you make it quick. Santa's got
a little get-together he's late for.

01:04:14.606 --> 01:04:16.482
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:20.486
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

01:04:20.612 --> 01:04:23.239
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

01:04:23.323 --> 01:04:26.409
- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.

01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:29.537
- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:33.750
I'm Kevin McCallister,
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.503
- Do you need the phone number?
- No, that's all right.

01:04:36.628 --> 01:04:38.796
Okay.
This is extremely important.

01:04:38.922 --> 01:04:43.718
Would you please tell him that, instead of
presents this year, I just want my family back.

01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:48.723
No toys. Nothing but Peter,
Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:51.017
And my aunt and my cousins.

01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:54.312
And, if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:59.192
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

01:04:59.317 --> 01:05:02.237
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.448
My elf took the last of the candy canes
home to her boyfriend.

01:05:05.573 --> 01:05:07.617
- That's okay.
- No, no, no. Don't be silly.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.703
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.997
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

01:05:13.122 --> 01:05:16.209
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:18.920
I won't. Thanks.

01:05:29.848 --> 01:05:32.392
Son of a...

01:08:28.568 --> 01:08:30.819
Merry Christmas.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.363
Huh?

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.532
May I sit down?

01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:49.506
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:53.384
She's about your age.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.720
- Do you know her?
- No.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:58.890
- You live next to me, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:03.478
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.482
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true.

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:09.484
Okay?

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.778
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:13.988
Swear to it?

01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:16.783
- No.
- Yeah, I had a feeling.

01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:20.036
Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:23.038
- It is?
- I think so.

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:25.834
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:32.340
I've been kind of a pain lately.

01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:34.843
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:38.220
I really haven't been
too good this year.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:41.140
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...

01:09:41.265 --> 01:09:43.393
because I really like my family.

01:09:43.518 --> 01:09:46.020
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:49.566
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:54.153
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.740
Especially with an older brother.

01:09:57.866 --> 01:10:02.120
Deep down you always love 'em,
but you can forget that you love 'em.

01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:04.914
And you can hurt them,
and they can hurt you.

01:10:05.039 --> 01:10:08.751
And that's not just
because you're young.

01:10:08.877 --> 01:10:12.088
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:14.132
Sure.

01:10:14.215 --> 01:10:17.844
I came to hear my granddaughter sing,
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:23.600
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:27.520
- At church?
- Oh, you're always welcome at church.

01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:30.023
I'm not welcome with my son.

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:34.819
Years back, before you and
your family moved on the block...

01:10:34.944 --> 01:10:37.405
I had an argument with my son.

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:41.784
- How old is he?
- Oh, he's grown up.

01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:44.495
We lost our tempers...

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:47.582
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

01:10:47.665 --> 01:10:52.587
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.507
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:58.301
I'm afraid if I call him,
he won't talk to me.

01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:00.637
How do you know?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.723
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:07.519
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:11.147
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

01:11:11.272 --> 01:11:13.483
You're never too old
to be afraid.

01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:16.361
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

01:11:16.486 --> 01:11:19.906
It's dark, there's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:23.409
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

01:11:23.535 --> 01:11:25.954
Basements are like that.

01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:28.957
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.042
and I found out
it's not so bad.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:33.419
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.797
but if you turn on the lights,
it's no big deal.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.343
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:42.512
What if he won't talk to me?

01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:45.932
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:48.643
and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.

01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:52.313
I don't care how mad I was,
I'd talk to my dad...

01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:54.315
especially around the holidays.

01:11:54.399 --> 01:11:57.527
I don't know.

01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:00.822
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:04.284
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

01:12:04.409 --> 01:12:06.244
I send her a check.

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:10.665
I wish my grandparents sent that.
They always send me clothes.

01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:13.668
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

01:12:13.751 --> 01:12:17.046
- Oh, that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.091
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:22.343
- Oh?
- Yeah.

01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:26.556
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:29.934
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:31.936
You think about what I said.

01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:33.813
- All right?
- Okay.

01:12:33.938 --> 01:12:37.817
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.035
- What about you?
- Me?

01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:49.120
Yeah. You and your son.

01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:52.540
We'll see what happens.

01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:55.585
Merry Christmas.

01:12:55.668 --> 01:12:57.587
Merry Christmas.

01:13:50.348 --> 01:13:54.352
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.818
Okay, we'll check it out first.
We can always come back for the truck.

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.702
How do you wanna go in?

01:15:34.786 --> 01:15:38.248
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:41.793
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

01:15:43.837 --> 01:15:47.757
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.884
and the people
who sold it on sale.

01:15:49.968 --> 01:15:51.886
Amen.

01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:18.621
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

01:16:31.926 --> 01:16:34.387
Merry Christmas, little fella.

01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:37.056
We know that you're in there...

01:16:37.182 --> 01:16:40.059
and that you're all alone.

01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:42.812
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

01:16:42.896 --> 01:16:46.441
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:50.111
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:16:50.195 --> 01:16:54.157
No, no. We got
some nice presents for you.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.702
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

01:17:00.622 --> 01:17:03.374
Shoot!

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:07.253
What? What? What?

01:17:07.378 --> 01:17:10.381
What? What happened?

01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:14.052
Get that little...

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:25.563
Hello.

01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:33.363
Yes! Yes!

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:35.532
The little jerk is armed!

01:17:35.615 --> 01:17:39.536
That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around
the front! You go down the basement!

01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:42.080
That little...

01:18:18.366 --> 01:18:20.410
Ow!

01:18:42.056 --> 01:18:44.267
That smart aleck.

01:20:12.021 --> 01:20:16.943
Oh, boy, that's it, you little...
you little son of a...

01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:20.029
Oh, not this time,
you little brat.

01:20:23.616 --> 01:20:26.077
You little creep, you,
where are you?

01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:30.373
Where are you, you little creep?

01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:54.022
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:27.555
I'll rip his head off!

01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:38.525
You're dead, kid.

01:22:25.572 --> 01:22:28.700
Where are you,
you little creep?

01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:47.677
Harry! I'm comin' in!

01:22:52.307 --> 01:22:54.684
Oh, no, I'm really scared!

01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:57.437
It's too late for you, kid.
We're already in the house.

01:22:57.562 --> 01:23:01.608
- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.

01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:04.277
Why, you...

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.201
Now you're dead!

01:23:35.475 --> 01:23:37.977
I'm gonna kill that kid!

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.495
- Marv!
- Harry?

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.622
Why the hell'd
you take your shoes off?

01:23:57.747 --> 01:24:00.875
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

01:24:02.293 --> 01:24:06.047
I'm up here, you morons!
Come and get me!

01:24:08.258 --> 01:24:11.928
You guys give up,
or are you thirsty for more?

01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:24.107
- Heads up!
- Huh?

01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:27.360
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

01:24:27.485 --> 01:24:30.989
Ow!

01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:34.492
Yes!

01:24:38.663 --> 01:24:41.374
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

01:24:41.499 --> 01:24:43.459
- Aw, shut up, will ya!
- Oh!

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.588
- What is it?
- You're missin' some teeth.

01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:50.884
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth! I'll kill him!

01:24:51.009 --> 01:24:54.387
I'll kill him!

01:24:54.512 --> 01:24:57.307
You bomb me
with one more can, kid...

01:24:57.390 --> 01:25:01.561
and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

01:25:04.022 --> 01:25:06.149
911 Emergency.

01:25:06.232 --> 01:25:08.985
Help. My house is being robbed.

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:13.656
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:18.912
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:21.915
There he is!

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:26.169
Ah! I got ya!

01:25:26.252 --> 01:25:29.631
I got him, Harry!
Harry, I got him!

01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:32.800
Harry, get up! Give me a hand!

01:25:32.884 --> 01:25:37.055
Ow! I got him!

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.642
Harry, help me! Get up!

01:25:40.767 --> 01:25:43.520
I got him!

01:26:22.058 --> 01:26:26.896
- What are you doing, Marv?
- Harry, don't move.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:30.942
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

01:26:31.067 --> 01:26:34.362
Marv, what are you doing?
Marv...

01:26:37.448 --> 01:26:41.035
Did I get him?
Did I get him?

01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:43.454
Where is it?
Where is it?

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:46.749
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it? Huh?

01:26:46.833 --> 01:26:50.628
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

01:26:54.007 --> 01:26:57.427
Whoa! Whoa!

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:00.972
Whoa! Whoa!

01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:04.225
Whoa! Whoa!

01:27:16.779 --> 01:27:18.907
Where'd he go?

01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:21.034
Maybe he committed suicide.

01:27:21.159 --> 01:27:23.286
Down here, you big horse's ass!

01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:26.331
Come and get me
before I call the police!

01:27:26.456 --> 01:27:28.625
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.668
That's just what
he wants us to do...

01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:34.255
us to go back downstairs through
his fun house so we get all tore up.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.592
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the... From a tree house?

01:27:37.675 --> 01:27:39.594
Come on.

01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:41.971
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.724
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared, Marv?

01:27:44.849 --> 01:27:47.435
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

01:27:52.023 --> 01:27:53.942
Come on.

01:27:57.529 --> 01:27:58.073
Come on!

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:08.414
Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.501
- Let's go back, Harry.
- Shut up!

01:28:11.584 --> 01:28:14.838
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:17.757
Shut it, Marv!

01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:23.137
Hey, guys, check this out.

01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:26.015
Go back! Go back!

01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:27.600
- Go back.
- Okay.

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:56.838
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way, you dope!

01:29:14.439 --> 01:29:19.194
- There he is!
- Hey, I'm calling the cops.

01:29:19.277 --> 01:29:22.197
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He wants us to follow him.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.407
I got a better idea.
Come on.

01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:45.678
Hiya, pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:48.765
Get over here!

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.312
What are we
gonna do to him, Harry?

01:29:54.437 --> 01:29:58.816
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

01:29:58.942 --> 01:30:01.069
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:05.073
I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.

01:30:05.156 --> 01:30:07.659
Or shove a nail through his foot.

01:30:07.784 --> 01:30:11.037
I'm gonna bite off every one
of these little fingers one at a time.

01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:22.966
Come on.
Let's get you home.

01:30:44.696 --> 01:30:48.867
Wow. This is great.

01:30:51.536 --> 01:30:54.372
Nice move... always leaving
the water running.

01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:57.709
Now we know each and
every house that you've hit.

01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:04.340
Hey, you know, we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

01:31:04.424 --> 01:31:07.385
- Yeah.
- Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:11.639
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

01:31:11.723 --> 01:31:14.559
Hey, come on. Come on.

01:31:14.684 --> 01:31:17.020
- Hands off the head, pal!
- Come on!

01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:15.286
I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.

01:32:15.411 --> 01:32:18.373
You're not. You know, you're beating
yourself up there, you know.

01:32:18.456 --> 01:32:21.000
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know, you...

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:24.504
Gee, you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at... Look at us.

01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:29.050
I mean, we're on the road 48, 49 weeks out of the year.
We hardly see our families.

01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:32.512
Uh, Joe over there... Gosh, you know, he...

01:32:32.637 --> 01:32:35.348
He forgets his kids' names
half the time.

01:32:35.473 --> 01:32:39.185
Ziggy over there... He doesn't even...
He's never even met his kid.

01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:42.981
Eddie... Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.

01:32:43.106 --> 01:32:47.944
Tell me, have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

01:32:50.822 --> 01:32:52.866
No.

01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:56.411
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.746
Yeah, it was...
it was terrible too.

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:02.125
You know, I was all distraught and
everything. You know, the wife and I...

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:06.254
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:10.258
All day. You know, and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

01:33:10.341 --> 01:33:13.845
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.598
- Oh!
- Whew, yeah. He was okay, you know.

01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:21.603
After six, seven weeks, you know, he
came around and started talking again.

01:33:21.686 --> 01:33:26.149
But he's okay. You know, they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

01:33:26.232 --> 01:33:28.985
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well, you brought it up.

01:33:29.068 --> 01:33:32.113
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well, I'm sorry I did.

01:33:58.014 --> 01:33:59.891
Mom?

01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:06.356
Mom?

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.529
Mom?

01:34:58.283 --> 01:35:02.328
Kevin? Kevin!

01:35:33.318 --> 01:35:35.612
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:35:44.829 --> 01:35:47.540
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

01:36:07.101 --> 01:36:09.229
Where is everybody else?

01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:13.441
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much, but...

01:36:13.525 --> 01:36:18.112
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab
and drool all over you, did I?

01:36:18.196 --> 01:36:20.490
- I don't drool.
- You guys, would you shut up!

01:36:20.573 --> 01:36:23.910
Come on, you guys, it's Christmas.
Kevin! Kevin, Kevin, my boy!

01:36:24.035 --> 01:36:25.912
- Oh, my God!
- Kevin, how are ya?

01:36:26.037 --> 01:36:27.914
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Mom.

01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:30.792
Good to see you. Ah, you're all right.
I love you. You okay?

01:36:30.875 --> 01:36:33.503
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev.

01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:39.175
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:43.054
Thanks, Buzz.

01:36:43.179 --> 01:36:46.057
Wait a minute.
How did you guys get home?

01:36:46.182 --> 01:36:49.519
Oh, we took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

01:36:49.602 --> 01:36:52.272
Oh, no.
Oh, thank you.

01:36:52.397 --> 01:36:54.315
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:36:54.399 --> 01:36:56.956
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

01:36:56.982 --> 01:36:58.469
I went shopping yesterday.

01:37:00.864 --> 01:37:02.657
You? Shopping?

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.660
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

01:37:07.203 --> 01:37:09.539
- What?
- No kiddin'?

01:37:09.664 --> 01:37:13.751
What a funny guy. What else did
you do while we were away?

01:37:13.877 --> 01:37:16.754
Just hung around.

01:37:19.591 --> 01:37:21.718
You guys,
put the stuff upstairs.

01:37:21.843 --> 01:37:25.680
You went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe, and he's going shopping?

01:37:25.763 --> 01:37:28.516
- Buzz, forget it.
- This is not the Kevin I knew.

01:37:51.956 --> 01:37:54.292
Honey, what's this?

01:38:51.933 --> 01:38:55.562
Kevin!
What did you do to my room?
