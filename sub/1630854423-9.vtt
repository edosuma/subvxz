WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:08.050
It's tight.

00:08.132 --> 00:11.011
Guess this is what my acting coach meant
when she said,

00:11.094 --> 00:12.804
"You need to reveal yourself more."

00:13.514 --> 00:15.224
That's a good one, Mr. Manganiello.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.225
It's Joe.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.018
Joe, right. Sorry.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.144
So we--

00:19.228 --> 00:21.396
We're just gonna capture
a little test footage for the studio.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.273
We'll get started in just a minute here.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.276
But again, very excited
to be working with you on the film, sir.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.403
Masked Man. It's a dream role.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.698
Well, that means a lot coming
from the mouth of Alcide Herveaux himself.

00:33.909 --> 00:34.910
Who?

00:34.993 --> 00:36.328
It's his character from <i>True Blood</i>.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.539
I-- It's good to let him know
that I'm a fan of his work.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.415
You know, makes him feel comfortable.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.376
Who cares how he feels? He's a worker.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.753
No, Jo. The culture
of Hollywood is very different.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.088
These celebrities, they get coddled.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.257
And we need him,
so we're gonna coddle away.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.468
Okay, so we're just flying in
a head rig for you here.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.345
Just to capture
that beautiful Manganiello mug.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.429
No. Won't be necessary.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.014
- And it's Joe.
- Joe, right.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.224
Becauseâ€¦

00:57.975 --> 00:59.601
I'm going to be wearing this.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.856
Helps me get into character.
Had it custom made.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.775
Guess this is what my facialist meant
when she said,

01:06.859 --> 01:08.026
"A good mask is gonna cost you."

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
Indeed.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.907
But this is just for the moments
of the film where you take the mask off.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.077
Yeah, I'm not gonna be
taking it off for the entire movie.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.161
Makes sense.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.330
Sorry, why's that?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.291
Wouldn't be in keeping
with the canon of the story.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.585
Think about it.
Masked Man taking off his mask.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.420
It's like giving your D&D party

01:26.503 --> 01:29.006
the dragon's full hit point total
and list of lair actions

01:29.089 --> 01:30.924
- right out of the gate.
- You got that right.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.719
- What is he talking about?
- I have no idea.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.597
You look upset.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.848
I am very upset, Jo.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.933
You do not look upset. You better smile.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.352
Okay. So, this guy's gonna
hide his face the whole movie?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.104
The studio's gonna freak out.
I'm gonna freak out.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.522
- The fans are gonna freak out.
- David.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.483
You're management.
Be forceful and tell the worker to comply.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.526
Smile!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.862
That's not the culture, okay?
I don't know what the culture is.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.656
That culture you're describing
is the last days of the USSR.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.241
It's fine. It's fine.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.577
You know, we'll get through this, right?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.038
- Do not panic.
- David! Gonna need a water.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.416
Water flying in.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.376
Get him a fucking water!

02:20.015 --> 02:23.602
Deceptively simple,
but with endless possibilities.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.814
<i>Playpen</i> asks the question,
"Why play someone else's game

02:27.898 --> 02:29.942
- when you can build your own?"
- When you can build your own.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.402
- Nailed it.
- Wow.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.198
- Are you really gonna clap every time?
- Yeah, you don't have to clap every time.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.158
You know, I want your honest feedback.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.409
- We're sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
It's a great pitch.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.663
I think it's gonna go even better
without Ian in the room

02:42.746 --> 02:44.831
gumming up the works with his,
you know, his--

02:44.915 --> 02:46.875
Effortless confidence
and natural charisma?

02:46.959 --> 02:49.503
I have those things too. I'm confident.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.172
You should tell that to your hives.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.340
Shit! Okay.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.093
- Well, I'll-- I can wear a turtleneck or--
- You can hide the hives,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.303
but you cannot hide
that lack of confidence.

02:58.387 --> 03:02.099
I am confident. About programming.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.643
This is just-- It's a new gear for me.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.645
Everything is riding on this.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.897
- I can't screw it up, and if I--
- Oh, my God, they're spreading.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.816
Okay, Poppy. Poppy.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.151
Poppy! Relax.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.197
Listen, the pitch doesn't matter.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.658
Oh, my God. You sound just like Ian.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.909
Of course it matters!

03:20.993 --> 03:25.080
I have to convince this guy
to buy my game for $50 million!

03:25.163 --> 03:27.291
He's not buying your game.
He's buying you.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.252
You have to convince him
to invest in Poppy.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.297
And he's not gonna do that
unless you march in there with confidence

03:33.380 --> 03:36.758
like the money's already yours
and the pitch doesn't matter.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.972
- That is being confident.
- That is being untethered from reality.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.349
What's the difference?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.186
Wow, it's actually spooky.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.402
Now, all my new hires are my babies.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.362
And I love my new babies.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.073
I can't wait to get to know
each and every one of you.

04:00.574 --> 04:05.412
But first, I wanna introduce you
to some of my greatest success stories.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.706
This is Rachel.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.626
A gay woman of color.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.669
A college dropout.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.796
Halfway to a wasted life.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.089
Maybe a few days away
from picking up a needle.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.595
- No. No, no. I don't do that.
- And then Carol steps in, extends a hand,

04:21.678 --> 04:26.558
and this gay orphan rises in the ranks
to become Head of Monetization.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.810
And then there's Brad.

04:28.894 --> 04:33.690
A Polish-Indian ex-con
who started as a janitor

04:33.774 --> 04:36.151
and then went on to work in monetization.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.153
He'd be dead in a ditch
if it wasn't for Carol.

04:38.237 --> 04:41.073
Actually, I started in monetization,
and then I went to jail.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.616
And I'm not a college dropout.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.826
I just stopped paying tuition,
and then they

04:44.910 --> 04:47.204
- kicked me out.
- Look at 'em now.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.664
Both empowered enough

04:48.747 --> 04:52.334
to feel like they can interrupt me
when I'm doing a thing.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.961
- Sorry, Carol.
- Sorry, Carol.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.547
Carol loves to see it. And this Phil.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.215
- Hi.
- He the art director.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.551
Brought in before my new hiring policies.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.970
You know, old-school <i>MQ</i>.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.139
But seriously, we don't have
a lot of Phils around here nowadays.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.933
My name is Phil.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.395
Okay. You know what then?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.813
We're gonna call you Young Phil.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.565
And Art Phil, you be Old Phil.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.402
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Come on now, don't be cranky, Old Phil.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.113
But on a serious note, really.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.242
Phil here, he doesn't reflect the younger,
more diverse hiring practices

05:25.325 --> 05:27.953
that I've put in place
since I've taken over leadership.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.204
Bingo.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.497
Carol just admitted

05:30.581 --> 05:33.584
this company discriminates against
hiring people like me.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.169
People like you?

05:35.252 --> 05:39.506
Yeah, I'm over the age of 40,
which is a protected category.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.259
What you've just done is called ageism.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.343
Is that a thing?

05:43.427 --> 05:46.013
You bet your uneducated ass it is.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.682
- Jesus, Phil.
- Okay, calm down. Calm down.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.726
Now, Phil, you know me.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.144
It's Carol.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.771
You know
I would never discriminate based on age.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.774
Oh, yeah? Show of hands.
Who here is over the age of 40?

05:59.318 --> 06:03.155
Plenty of people over the age of 40
work in this office.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.574
They're just not in this room.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.409
Where is David?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.328
I rest my case.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.919
Is he laughing or coughing?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.003
- Both, I think.
- Okay.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.839
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

06:20.923 --> 06:25.677
Just biding my time,
enduring all the quiet indignities.

06:25.761 --> 06:30.224
The long nights, the constant demand
to come in on a holiday

06:30.307 --> 06:34.645
to just whip up a magical forest
or winter wonderland.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.524
But it was all worth it
because I finally caught you in the act.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.691
And all of you.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.610
You're all my witnesses.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.613
I shall leverage your generation's desire

06:44.696 --> 06:48.116
for performative accountability
and transparency

06:48.200 --> 06:49.743
to my advantage.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.245
This is my golden ticket.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.248
This is the year of Phil!

06:57.876 --> 06:59.586
Goddamn it!

07:07.135 --> 07:09.805
Feel the taste of my blade, White Knight.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.474
I think the Masked Man's German.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.894
- Digging it. Super cool.
- Yeah.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.231
I am getting so boned.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.732
David, I'm here.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.985
- What? What are you doing here?
- Jo texted me.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.487
She said you were getting manhandled
by this Hollywood snowflake.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.364
So, I just wanna let you know, man,

07:27.447 --> 07:30.826
that I am literally willing to fight
this guy if it means saving my movie.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.910
It's my movie.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.704
And I don't want you
fighting the star of it.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.414
- Understand?
- If you are concerned about his size,

07:35.497 --> 07:36.540
- do not be.
- I'm not.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.960
Because I'm just going to drop a level,
take him down, go to full mount and then

07:40.043 --> 07:42.963
- have a very effective ground and pound.
- Do not touch his body or his face,

07:43.046 --> 07:44.131
to be clear, okay?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.341
I need you to leave.
Go back to GrimPop, please.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.303
On a bit of a sabbatical from GrimPop.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.221
Kind of a self-imposed exile.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.348
She kicked you out, huh?

07:54.308 --> 07:55.684
No, she didn't kick me out.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.061
Poppy and I are just going through
a little bit of a thing.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.813
They kissed.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.356
What? We did not kiss!

08:01.440 --> 08:02.524
They totally kissed.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.026
We didn't kiss! I didn't kiss Poppy!

08:04.109 --> 08:05.944
- There's no kissing!
- Yeah, Jo. Poppy is--

08:06.028 --> 08:07.279
A prude?

08:07.362 --> 08:09.281
- Well, no. No, she's just--
- Diseased?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.365
- No. That's--
- Forget it.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.909
I'm just gonna go save my movie. Okay?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.203
Do not go in there.
That's my movie. It's my movie.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.872
What the hell?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.666
Trust me, David.
Joe loves the game. Ian created the game.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.668
If Ian tells Joe to take the mask off,
he'll accept it.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.045
And if he doesn't, huh?

08:23.128 --> 08:25.964
Then Ian's gonna get his ass handed to him
and Joe's gonna walk off the production.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.218
Yeah, oh.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.643
Hey.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.523
Hey.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.485
Dude. Ian?

08:46.568 --> 08:48.737
Oh, man, I didn't recognize you at first.

08:49.446 --> 08:53.450
Wow. I thought you were smaller,
but I don't know.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.077
Maybe it's like a presence thing.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.246
- What is happening?
- I'm a big fan.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.956
Longtime player.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.834
Could I get you
to sign the inside of my mask?

09:02.417 --> 09:05.879
That way, if I'm ever tempted to take it
off during the duration of the film,

09:06.672 --> 09:09.591
I will see your signature
and I'll remember why I'm doing this.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.222
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.474
- Yeah. Totally. I'll totally sign it.
- Awesome. Nice.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.268
- I keep a Sharpie with me, just in case.
- Perfect.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.561
- This is huge.
- Really?

09:20.644 --> 09:22.062
You have no idea. Yeah.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.689
Hey, you know, you're great.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.732
- You're great.
- David, he's great.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.651
David. This guy's great.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.444
Great.

09:30.946 --> 09:31.989
No, no, no.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.283
That old bitch is not taking Carol down.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.327
As a legal precaution, you might
wanna start phasing out the word "old."

09:37.411 --> 09:38.328
And maybe "bitch."

09:38.412 --> 09:41.248
Don't you dare take "bitch" from me, okay?
I'm saying "bitch."

09:42.291 --> 09:45.002
- Okay.
- Now, we can fix this. We can fix this.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.923
I just need to fire a few people
so I can hire some new old bitches.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.259
Yeah, about that.
We did a quick diversity analysis

09:52.342 --> 09:54.720
of the office
to find the best candidates to let go.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.514
And, as you can see, you did
such a great job diversifying the office

09:57.598 --> 10:00.142
that virtually every employee
now falls under a protected category.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.435
No.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.811
How is that possible?

10:03.520 --> 10:06.315
What about that Lindsay in accounting?
She's young and she white.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.482
- And pregnant.
- And bisexual.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.484
Literally every single person
in accounting is bisexual.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.861
It's always a numbers game with them.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.739
Damn it. I am a victim of my own success.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.699
In a way, you should be proud.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.827
And in a bigger, more real way,
you should be angry and afraid.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.329
Carol is screwed.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.914
Phil is gonna sue this company,

10:21.997 --> 10:26.585
and then Montreal is going to fire my ass
because there are no other asses to fire.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.755
Well, almost. Despite your best efforts,

10:29.838 --> 10:33.175
there is one department
in the company that remains unprotected.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.224
Yes, bitch.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.354
So being confident is all
about getting out of your head

10:45.437 --> 10:47.272
so you could be in the present moment.

10:47.356 --> 10:52.277
Okay, so you want me
to shut my brain off? I can do that.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.530
- Really?
- Uh-huh. It's like clearing a hard drive.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.115
Try to not think of anything
for ten seconds.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.749
All I hear is screaming.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.834
Exactly.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.630
Your mind has become too powerful,
and it's holding you hostage.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.882
In order to get you out of your headâ€¦

11:17.719 --> 11:18.929
I'm gonna have to get in it.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.349
When you look in a mirror,
what do you see?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.351
- Nothing.
- Wow.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.436
- I don't own a mirror.
- That explains the hair.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.189
- What's wrong with my--
- Okay, don't think, just answer.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.024
- When I wake up in the morning, I feel?
- Dread.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.609
- About?
- Everything I have to do--

11:32.693 --> 11:34.778
- So the future?
- And everything I've ever done.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.988
And the past.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.906
- This is great.
- How is that great?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.700
Because the future
and the past doesn't exist.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.828
- All that exists is the present moment.
- Oh, come on!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.290
Poppy. I am trying to help you.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.959
Really? 'Cause it sounds
like you're trying to out-Ian Ian.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.129
Look, I know you think
that we're exactly the same,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.298
but there's a big difference
between me and Ian.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.509
He likes you. I don't.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.803
And I'm only trying to help you

11:59.887 --> 12:02.472
so you don't blow this chance
at selling our game.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.392
Wait, hold on. Our game?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.352
Since when is this your game?

12:07.436 --> 12:09.313
- Since always.
- I built it.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.064
Yeah, and I saw its potential.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.151
The balls on you.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.655
I worked at <i>Mythic Quest</i> for eight years.
Not once did I consider it "my game."

12:18.739 --> 12:19.823
Why not?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.408
Well-- S--

12:26.371 --> 12:27.748
I don't know.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.501
Okay, change of plan.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.753
I want to get out of my head
and into yours.

12:32.836 --> 12:36.256
Teach me how to live life
with this insane level of confidence.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.883
I mean, I could try my best.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.385
But we only have 12 hours
until we need to be at our pitch.

12:40.469 --> 12:44.598
You think you're coming to the pitch?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.475
Holy shit!

12:46.558 --> 12:50.145
Crack open that beautiful skull
and let me in.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.231
This is why I don't like you.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.942
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.318
Yes.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.988
This is great.
You are-- I mean, you got the moves.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.282
Well, I mean,
it's like looking in the mirror.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.118
- I learned everything from watching you.
- Thank you for saying that.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.413
I was just thinking, I feel like
you could play me in a movie about me.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.415
You haven't given up the rights
to your life story, have you?

13:10.499 --> 13:12.042
- Absolutely not.
- Dude.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.295
Maybe I could do all the stunts
that you're too chickenshit to do.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.215
- Well, I actually do all my own stunts.
- Of course you do.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.844
This guy. David, this guy is the best.
It's like we're twins, huh?

13:21.927 --> 13:24.847
Yeah, it's fantastic.
Look at us. This is crazy.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.807
Julius and Vincent.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.892
- Not that <i>Twins</i>.
- Sorry.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.270
No, I was thinking that we looked alike.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.314
Spitting image.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.359
- See? Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. All right. Let's practice.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.362
Screw this. I'm tired of this meathead
pushing me around. This is my movie.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.697
- Your movie.
- I'm the producer.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.742
I don't care how big you think you are
or how much weight you think you can lift.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.327
Either respect me or you get the hell out.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.162
- Tell him.
- I will tell him. I'll tell him right now.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.915
- All you can do is come down.
- Ian, can you come in here a sec?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.709
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
Now.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.338
Sounds like you're getting yelled at.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.466
No, this bitch doesn't yell at me.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.723
Joe, need anything?
A little water or some peptides?

14:07.806 --> 14:09.641
- I'm good, Dave.
- Okay, cool, cool, cool.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.728
We are really vibing in there.
Can you feel that?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.521
He doesn't get a lot
of my references though.

14:14.605 --> 14:15.439
Get out.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.065
Well, no.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.359
I'm having a good time out there.
I think I should stay.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.069
It's my movie, and I need you to get out.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.325
I'm going through kind of,
like a rough patch, and it would be cool

14:26.408 --> 14:28.118
- if you just allow me to--
- Don't care.

14:32.164 --> 14:35.334
Well, I'm the creator of the game.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.711
So I should at least have some say--

14:37.794 --> 14:39.171
You don't work here. Okay?

14:39.671 --> 14:41.298
You have no authority over the game.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.883
You have no authority over the movie.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.052
You have no authority
of anything to do with <i>Mythic Quest</i>

14:45.135 --> 14:46.595
or anything that is here. So leave.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.931
I like to think
I have some spiritual authority.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.642
Great. Tell that to the cops when
they're arresting you for trespassing.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.645
You wouldn't call the cops on me.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.189
Try me.

15:02.694 --> 15:03.779
That wasn't a flinch.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.950
I was gonna drop a level
and then single leg takedown.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.786
Then I was gonna transition
into a triangleâ€¦

15:14.081 --> 15:15.415
and then ground and pound.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.587
Fine.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.257
Fine. Forget it. I don't need you.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.967
I don't need your stupid movie.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.719
I'll go somewhere where I'm valued.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.853
That was incredible, David.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.273
How come you can't give the Hollywood
pretty boy both barrels like that?

15:39.356 --> 15:41.775
- He needs to fall in line.
- For the last time, enough!

15:41.859 --> 15:43.527
Stop interfering with my job.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.988
Let me do it my way, would you please?

15:46.905 --> 15:51.702
All right. Let's get one thing straight.
You work for me, Jo. Do you understand?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.787
You may not always agree with me,
but it doesn't matter.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.331
You just have to trust me.
I can see you're dedicated.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.458
Look, I know that you wanna do a good job,

15:58.542 --> 16:01.420
but you won't be doing a good job
if you don't listen to me.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.506
So just cut the shit and let me do my job.
It's gonna be better for you.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.968
It's gonna be better for me.
It's gonna be better for the movie, Jo.

16:08.719 --> 16:09.720
Got it?

16:10.220 --> 16:11.388
Got it.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.473
I'm sorry.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.685
You're right.
I won't wear the mask the whole time.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.145
You're the boss.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.272
Look, I'm just
a really passionate artist, okay?

16:20.355 --> 16:23.817
Sometimes you need to rein me in.
Just ask my wife.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.571
Great.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.408
You did that?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.411
- No, you did.
- But you pressed the button though, right?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.038
Yeah, I pressed it,
but you did the talking.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.040
Well, yeah, I guess you're right.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.708
Yeah.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.879
- That's your bad shoulder.
- Yeah, it is.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.673
- Yeah, let's do this one. Yeah.
- Always harder on the left.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.467
- This one doesn't have a lot of structure.
- I know.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.844
All right. Let's show this meathead
what we got. Come on.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.222
- Stand behind me. It looks more powerful.
- Yeah. All right.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.183
Okay, Joe,
why don't we start from the beginning?

17:08.237 --> 17:11.156
Hi. Will you join my class action lawsuit?

17:11.240 --> 17:14.952
I'm gonna take down
this whole rotten company from the inside.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.578
I love my job.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.580
Why?

17:19.665 --> 17:21.124
- Because I-- b--
- Just shut up.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.088
God, I gotta find people that hate
this place just as much as I do.

17:31.260 --> 17:32.261
Bingo.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.517
Hey, guys.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.270
I am suing this company for ageism.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.354
Will you sign my--

17:42.855 --> 17:44.106
- Hi there.
- Hi, hello.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.317
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey, Phil.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.987
Have you met our new testers,
Mikey and Andy?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.572
I hired them just this morning.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.116
- Guys, this is Phil.
- Hi.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.034
Mikey, did you get that pillow
for your back?

17:56.118 --> 17:57.744
Sure did. Thank you so much.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.913
Mikey has a bad back, Phil.

18:00.581 --> 18:01.832
Goddamn it.

18:06.170 --> 18:09.047
Let that be a lesson to you, boys. Okay?

18:09.673 --> 18:12.843
Nobody messes with Carol.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.012
Absolutely.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.889
- No, we would never.
- Hands off.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.224
- All right. Good to hear it.
- Yeah.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.351
- Glad to have ya.
- Thank you.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.437
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Thank you.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.856
She's a nice woman.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.232
- She's great.
- Yeah.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.611
- Who's Carol?
- I don't know.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.238
Is she the woman at the front desk?

18:34.031 --> 18:35.365
That was Mandy.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.576
No, that wasn't--

18:37.659 --> 18:39.578
- I thought her name was Andrea.
- That's wrong.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.998
Don't worry.
We still have plenty of time to get there.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.541
I'm not worried.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.626
Yeah, you seem good.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.753
I'm great. Hey, toss me your keys.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.880
Why?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.340
I wanna drive.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.387
Deceptively simple,

18:57.471 --> 18:59.556
but with endless possibilities.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.642
<i>Playpen </i>asks the question,

19:02.142 --> 19:07.189
"Why play someone else's game
when you can build your own?"

19:10.442 --> 19:12.069
Incredible. You've done it again.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.487
Thank you. Thank you.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.197
The graphics aren't
a hundred percent there.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.034
- But you see where I'm going with it.
- I totally get it. Great pitch.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.369
Pass.

19:21.537 --> 19:22.579
What now?

19:22.663 --> 19:24.081
It's gonna be a pass.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.293
As in, "Pass me the checkbook,

19:28.377 --> 19:31.088
'cause I can't wait
to invest in this game"?

19:32.756 --> 19:34.341
No, pass as in pass.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.552
I'm passing on your stupid little game.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.719
He's not buying it.

19:38.846 --> 19:39.847
Why?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.974
Why? Is it because we were late?

19:42.057 --> 19:45.060
Because the pedals
in Dana's car were very confusing.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.604
They're not. And it's on me.
I shouldn't have let her drive.

19:47.688 --> 19:51.233
No, it was more the part
where you rudely turned down my last offer

19:51.316 --> 19:53.652
and told me to "suck your duck."

19:54.236 --> 19:56.029
You remember that?

19:56.530 --> 20:00.617
Wait, this is the same guy?
You're pitching to the same guy?

20:00.701 --> 20:02.327
Yeah, of course,
because I was being confident.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.121
That's not confident! That is psychotic.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.206
What? Oh, my God!

20:06.290 --> 20:08.792
- What is the difference?
- Great.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.752
- Well, we're done here.
- Whatever.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.504
Well, you're not the only one.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.506
The-- There are thousands of VCs
in this town.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.133
They're all gonna tell you the same thing.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.968
Your game isn't investable.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.847
You need 12 million people building games
with <i>Playpen </i>for it to see any profits.

20:22.431 --> 20:23.682
Do you have 12 million friends?
