Someone's been eating my porridge.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.299
All right, breakfast,
it's just breakfast.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.340
Here comes Goldilocks.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.739
Hiya, lads.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.388
Hi, Auntie Mimi.

16:49.153 --> 16:51.179
Thanks for bringing
my case in, boys.

16:52.138 --> 16:53.599
(ALL) Auntie?

17:06.051 --> 17:07.354
Nice gaff.

17:07.403 --> 17:08.817
Relative to what?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.637
I'm sorry.

17:12.372 --> 17:13.378
No sweat.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.819
Seriously, I was out of line.

17:14.819 --> 17:17.887
D'you think you're the first dick
I've met? I'm a big girl.

17:18.317 --> 17:19.786
Fair enough. I deserved that.

17:20.646 --> 17:22.567
You didn't exactly
declare your hand, though, did you?

17:23.262 --> 17:24.575
What?

17:24.607 --> 17:26.259
It never occurred to you
that the chair might come

17:26.260 --> 17:27.499
as a bit of a surprise?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.139
Yeah, that's what I do...

17:29.140 --> 17:31.059
I lure men in with
my able-bodied ruse,

17:31.060 --> 17:33.739
so's they can humiliate
themselves.

17:33.740 --> 17:37.103
That's a good night out for me that.
How I like to spend my time.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.095
I'm not fooled, you know.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.713
You like me.

17:50.174 --> 17:52.580
Right, I'm off.
Nice to see you again, Ruby.

17:53.258 --> 17:55.217
You're looking... all grown up.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.806
Eyes to the front,
roll your tongues back in, lads.

17:59.048 --> 18:01.955
Take care of your brother.

18:05.728 --> 18:07.275
I am really sorry.

18:07.298 --> 18:08.579
That's OK.

18:08.580 --> 18:12.179
God gave you your talents,
and you use them to your advantage.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.766
Just don't take the piss.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.990
I really did need
to use the machine.

18:16.452 --> 18:19.048
My stuff was manky
when I came through the window.

18:20.342 --> 18:22.791
That's what I mean
about taking advantage.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.259
Break into my house again,
I'll have your tits for ash trays.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.220
Understood.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.228
How's your mum, then?

18:34.567 --> 18:35.869
She still hates you.

18:36.087 --> 18:37.502
No change there, then.

18:39.339 --> 18:40.738
Yeah, but why's it illegal?

18:40.763 --> 18:42.763
Fair enough nobody wants
babies with eight fingers

18:42.764 --> 18:44.762
on each hand, but fuck
it if you wear a condom.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.330
She's your first cousin.

18:47.837 --> 18:49.330
We've only got her word for that!

18:50.740 --> 18:52.219
Not seen her in ten years.

18:52.587 --> 18:53.994
You should get a DNA test done.

18:54.866 --> 18:57.963
I mean... it's hard to believe
she's the same species as you lot,

18:58.264 --> 18:59.580
let alone family.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.479
Get to fuck.

19:20.307 --> 19:23.035
OK. A blow job from a cousin.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.739
Now, that has got to be legal.

19:24.935 --> 19:26.323
How they going to test for that?

19:28.384 --> 19:29.761
She ain't my cousin.

19:33.753 --> 19:35.253
But I'm your step-son.

19:36.014 --> 19:39.151
Dad... please, do not shag my cousin.

19:40.937 --> 19:44.097
I'm not scared of you, right?
So why don't you just fuck off?!

19:49.189 --> 19:50.511
Who you talking to?

19:50.560 --> 19:55.080
No-one. I'm just doing
mi' exercises, for my lungs.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.674
Have you gone fucking mental?

20:02.225 --> 20:05.104
There's still lots of places
never been mapped, you know.

20:05.168 --> 20:10.025
Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,
and stuff. Thousands of islands.

20:10.415 --> 20:11.900
Don't you need degrees
for that though?

20:13.471 --> 20:15.499
This is all I need.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.867
Pieces of paper
and diplomas make no difference.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.444
What's she called?

20:23.477 --> 20:24.807
- Who?
- Bird you're looking at.

20:24.868 --> 20:26.419
Who gives a shit about her name?

20:26.490 --> 20:28.237
He only reads it for the articles.

20:35.243 --> 20:37.002
What is it? What's her name?

20:37.057 --> 20:39.779
Read it yourself if it matters
that much to you!

20:39.780 --> 20:41.539
Do I look like a fucking slave?!

20:41.540 --> 20:42.619
Do I?!

20:42.620 --> 20:43.952
No.

20:55.024 --> 20:56.339
Was it a gay thing?

20:58.793 --> 21:00.299
I can say it louder if you like?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.619
It's my own fault.
It was me what went there.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.386
Painted a target
on your head, did you?

21:08.620 --> 21:10.277
I'd help out, but...

21:13.180 --> 21:16.316
I fuck strangers
in alleyways and cars. This...

21:17.780 --> 21:19.579
It's an occupational hazard.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.859
I've fucked strangers
in alleyways and cars.

21:21.860 --> 21:23.579
Never had my head
caved in for my trouble.

21:23.580 --> 21:24.779
It's different.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.105
It shouldn't be.

21:28.140 --> 21:29.808
You can't let this rattle you.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.832
No... clearly.

21:33.371 --> 21:36.050
Need to get out, let no cunt
intimidate you. Be a man.

21:36.121 --> 21:37.659
I am a man.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.003
Well, do it, then.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.718
Oh!

22:14.140 --> 22:15.445
I'm sorry, mate.

22:17.392 --> 22:18.551
Sorry.

22:18.959 --> 22:20.415
Fucking virgin!

22:21.060 --> 22:24.274
He still says it's amnesia.
Ambulance picked him up in Gorton.

22:24.298 --> 22:25.977
- So?
- So who runs Gorton?

22:26.257 --> 22:27.649
Felix Dennehy.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.739
If Felix went for him,

22:29.740 --> 22:32.259
he wouldn't have left the job
half done, would he?

22:32.260 --> 22:35.059
We have to hit somebody.
We can't be seen to do nothing.

22:35.411 --> 22:40.001
Besides... the Dennehys have been
getting a bit previous.

22:40.032 --> 22:41.306
How hard?

22:41.337 --> 22:42.899
Think I might need to
tape it down, lads.

22:43.087 --> 22:46.055
How hard do we hit Big Felix?

22:48.241 --> 22:51.541
Random door in Gorton.
Not important.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.647
All right, Ruby?

23:00.711 --> 23:02.026
Billy.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.815
Uncle Billy.

23:05.754 --> 23:07.073
Step-uncle, if you like.

23:07.565 --> 23:10.330
You going running?
I'm quite fit myself.

23:11.592 --> 23:13.065
That's a fair assessment.

23:14.307 --> 23:16.158
- You know me and Mimi?
- Yeah.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.949
We're quite relaxed about stuff?

23:17.968 --> 23:19.270
Oh.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.293
Well, I will bear that in mind.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.051
Don't shit on your own doorstep,
Billy.

23:31.188 --> 23:33.012
(HE MOUTHS)

23:41.981 --> 23:43.305
Enjoy your detention?

23:43.321 --> 23:44.508
No.

23:44.535 --> 23:46.438
Next time, hand in your homework.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.985
Can I ask you a question, Miss?

23:48.024 --> 23:49.133
Mmm-hmm.

23:49.173 --> 23:53.102
I've got a mate who... can't read.
An adult, well, I mean... older boy.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.797
There are evening classes,
day classes at college too.

23:55.861 --> 23:59.140
He's not really a joiner.
I think he's embarrassed about it.

23:59.617 --> 24:02.649
You're not remotely as dumb as you
try to get away with, are you?

24:03.725 --> 24:06.415
He wants to travel. Work on ships.

24:07.869 --> 24:10.211
Your friend needs to get over
the embarrassment and deal with it,

24:10.659 --> 24:12.578
or his life chances will be limited.

24:13.017 --> 24:14.829
You need qualifications.

24:17.181 --> 24:19.204
Your mate. Frasier Kane.

24:19.260 --> 24:22.907
That boy has more than
just literacy problems, Croker.

24:22.992 --> 24:25.454
Why won't you give anybody a chance?
He's the smartest guy I know.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.125
I seriously doubt that.

24:28.613 --> 24:29.993
Thanks for the advice.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.026
Heaton.

24:39.609 --> 24:42.128
She always were a frustrated cow.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.659
Hated me.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.979
All right, sexy?

24:50.980 --> 24:53.939
♪ You've got to tease your man... ♪

24:53.940 --> 24:56.339
WOLF WHISTLE

24:56.340 --> 25:00.339
♪ You've got to please your man... ♪

25:02.690 --> 25:05.547
Is that her? Clever Girl.

25:05.580 --> 25:08.419
And the rest. That one'll
never starve, I tell you.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.258
Think she could conquer
the world, that one.

25:10.313 --> 25:11.704
Didn't you at that age?

25:11.787 --> 25:14.102
I was practising blow jobs
on bananas.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.938
I thought it was the best way
to a man's heart.

25:18.270 --> 25:21.029
She's had it hard, the kid.
When our Kenny died

25:21.061 --> 25:23.704
and her ma brought her back
from Australia to Glasgow,

25:24.102 --> 25:26.875
didn't tell a fucking soul.
Cut her off from the family.

25:26.927 --> 25:28.157
Is she Scots then?

25:28.204 --> 25:31.102
Only by misfortune.
Scouse by paternal line.

25:31.167 --> 25:32.446
And what brings her here?

25:32.479 --> 25:35.164
I've asked her half a dozen times,
still haven't got a clue.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.701
Got a light, mate?

25:55.740 --> 25:57.045
Outside.

25:57.062 --> 25:58.357
Now.

26:04.122 --> 26:05.654
You can't let this rattle you.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.146
Can I take that?

26:18.186 --> 26:19.185
You can get a cab closer.

26:19.232 --> 26:20.568
It's got to be this one.

26:21.220 --> 26:24.318
Just for argument's sake, say
you did shag a bird in a wheelie.

26:25.716 --> 26:27.130
In a wheelchair.

26:28.066 --> 26:29.625
Wouldn't it hurt?

26:29.681 --> 26:32.365
Maybe... if you let the brakes off.

26:33.141 --> 26:37.763
Nah, not me, her. I mean,
I'd be scared of breaking something.

26:37.789 --> 26:39.164
Hurting her.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.208
She wouldn't be able
to feel nothing.

26:41.243 --> 26:42.821
Oh, that's a misconception.

26:42.877 --> 26:45.586
In fact, for some of us,
sensation is heightened.

26:46.140 --> 26:48.000
Considerably heightened.

26:54.792 --> 26:56.137
Clem?

26:57.795 --> 26:59.152
Clementine!

27:00.867 --> 27:02.262
Clem!

27:13.424 --> 27:15.503
There's two Rs in sorry.

27:15.543 --> 27:18.688
I'm not a complete idiot.
Weren't enough bricks.

27:22.079 --> 27:24.485
I am. Really.

27:27.517 --> 27:28.837
Wait there.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.579
You robbed those
from someone's garden.

27:43.580 --> 27:46.298
Liberated is the word
you're looking for.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.979
Look, you're forgiven, all right?

27:48.980 --> 27:51.563
Go on about your business
with a clear conscience.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.368
You're not a dick,
just another regular lad.

27:55.663 --> 27:57.759
If I let stuff like that bother me,

27:58.060 --> 28:00.313
I'd really be up shit creek,
wouldn't I?

28:09.725 --> 28:12.548
I don't want to be just another lad.
I want to be your lad.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.649
No means no, Carl.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.722
Am I a man?

28:32.747 --> 28:35.334
Yep. My turn. Am I in a band?

28:35.380 --> 28:36.499
No.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.803
Wayne Rooney.

28:37.834 --> 28:41.219
No way, fuck off!
How did you just guess that?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.702
Because you're a bloke
and I thought like a bloke.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.631
I'm sitting here
with these largely on display,

28:47.719 --> 28:50.444
so I'll assume you're not
thinking about other women.

28:50.543 --> 28:52.982
Which leaves music and football
and you said he wasn't in a band.

28:53.662 --> 28:54.975
Yeah, but... it's still a leap.

28:55.011 --> 28:56.584
You're a Blue, right?

28:57.134 --> 29:01.133
Except you think you're sneaky, so you
tried to double-bluff me and pick a Red.

29:01.545 --> 29:03.944
But if you're going to pick a Red,
you'll pick an ugly one,

29:04.010 --> 29:05.311
cos you hate them that much.

29:05.342 --> 29:06.647
You are good.

29:06.717 --> 29:08.944
And significantly better off
than when I came in.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.733
Thanks.

29:13.654 --> 29:16.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't use made-up names.

29:17.327 --> 29:18.446
Yeah.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.899
Hiya.

29:20.462 --> 29:21.762
Hey.

29:24.946 --> 29:26.342
Behave yourself.

29:30.227 --> 29:33.688
If you could just retrieve my car
and deliver it to my home...

29:33.740 --> 29:37.619
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

29:37.620 --> 29:39.274
It's her, intit?

29:40.537 --> 29:43.422
Miss Heaton, detention queen.

29:43.868 --> 29:45.251
Get out of my way.

29:45.783 --> 29:47.110
We're not in school now.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.438
Excuse me.

29:48.452 --> 29:49.811
I don't think so.

29:50.462 --> 29:52.368
You never liked me.

29:52.422 --> 29:55.962
You weren't a very likable boy.
I see not much has changed.

29:56.016 --> 30:00.139
Watch your mouth. You can't hide
behind your desk now, you bitch.

30:01.940 --> 30:05.157
You're not...
You're not a stupid boy.

30:09.102 --> 30:11.821
There are programmes
where you can learn to read.

30:11.844 --> 30:12.859
You can't read?

30:12.860 --> 30:15.758
I'm not a stupid boy! I'm not a boy!

30:17.712 --> 30:19.188
Would you like to see?

30:19.232 --> 30:20.540
Shh!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.126
Stop it.

30:23.665 --> 30:26.524
Let's see how smart you are
with a real man up you.

30:26.540 --> 30:27.821
Get off me!

30:27.861 --> 30:28.915
Frasier!

30:28.930 --> 30:30.321
Boys, help me, please!

30:30.398 --> 30:31.704
Frasier.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.238
Shut the fuck up!

30:33.256 --> 30:34.940
I'll deal with you later.

30:34.988 --> 30:37.457
(SCREAMS)
Shut up! Shut up!

30:39.500 --> 30:42.098
Shh! Shh!

It's not accidental, is it?

35:24.811 --> 35:28.810
Was it the good Lord herself who
swung a tire iron at your bonce?

35:29.064 --> 35:30.547
I think not.
