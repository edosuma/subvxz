What you been on?
What's up? What's new?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.964
Everything, honestly.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.007
You know,
we're mad busy right now.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.384
Lot of shit poppin' off.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.886
Shit like what?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.347
Oh, well, we got a song
on a Spotify playlist,

10:39.430 --> 10:40.514
independently.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.516
Yo, I saw that shit.
Congrats.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.644
That's crazy.
Did Jill help you with that?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.941
-Yeah.
-That's what's up.
That's what it's about.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.777
It's about helping
each other elevate,

10:52.860 --> 10:54.320

11:04.455 --> 11:06.290

11:06.374 --> 11:08.501
We're, like,
everything is happening
like how we planned.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.835
-That's wild, right?
-Yeah.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.128
We got to celebrate.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.880
-Yo!

-Shawna: Nigga, what?!
A clarinet?!
-(both laughing)

11:24.308 --> 11:27.728
Yes, I do. Nightmares.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.064
I really had you rapping
like you in a episode of
"SpongeBob."

11:30.147 --> 11:33.442
-I'm sorry.
-And I did it! That's
the funny thing, I did it.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.902
No! (laughing)

11:34.985 --> 11:36.445
-You were a little trap Mozart.
-I really was.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.739
But I always had
to work twice as hard.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.616
-You were always
way more talented.
-Well,

11:40.699 --> 11:43.411
-we can't all have it.
-(both laugh)

11:43.494 --> 11:45.579

But for real though,

11:45.663 --> 11:47.832

track...

11:47.915 --> 11:49.583
-That shit's bananas.
-Yeah!

11:49.667 --> 11:51.669
-Hopefully, it just
keeps going up.
-It can.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.755
It can. How much money you put
into the marketing for it?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.549
-Um...
-Or, like, the PR?
Like, the press lineup?

11:56.632 --> 11:59.009
You know, like,
what's the strategy

11:59.093 --> 12:00.803
for radio, digital?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.222
Yeah, we-we're figuring
it out right now still.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.224
Listen, it's hard to
keep niggas' attention.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.060
Once you got that attention,
you do not want
to drop the ball, so.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.854
What's your
management saying?

12:09.937 --> 12:10.604
We're talking to
a couple people.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.357
Aight. Is it anybody
I would know?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.693
Yeah. Uh, funny enough,
remember Chastity?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.486
You know, Chastity?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.489

Chastity?!

12:20.573 --> 12:22.241
Chastity-Chastity?

12:22.324 --> 12:23.284
-Like, Titty Boy?
-That's the one.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.162
I know Chastity.
(laughs)

12:26.245 --> 12:29.081
D-don't do that shit.
Don't do that shit, please.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.208
(laughs)
Unless you like being broke.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.126
You gotta focus on somebody

12:32.209 --> 12:34.378
who's gonna get you
in the right rooms.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.922
Prioritize that. Aight?
Promise me you gonna do that.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.759
I mean...

12:40.843 --> 12:42.470
we could collab again.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.805
That single is fire,
so, like,

12:44.889 --> 12:46.640
y'all should be getting
to the money right now.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.517
Oh, so now you know
how to get to the money?

12:48.601 --> 12:49.518
-Don't do that.
-What about when I was
signed to you?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.062
We're grown now,
and I'm just saying

12:52.146 --> 12:53.647
I'm down to help you out.
That's it.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.650
I just produced
Reina Reign's video, right?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.652
-Oh my god.
-I'm thinking--
I'm thinking that...

12:58.736 --> 13:00.321
I could produce
your video. What?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.114
-Reina Reign?
-Yeah!

13:02.198 --> 13:03.699
Please don't talk about that
Kardashian rapper around me!

13:03.782 --> 13:06.785
-Who is writing her shit?
-You got jokes,

13:06.869 --> 13:08.537
-but Reina got fans, so...
-(scoffs) Okay,
and she got baby hairs.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.123
Don't know how that happened.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.083
All her songs sound stupid.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.418
(mocking)
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.922
-Me and my bitches,
we all gonna ball. Ay!
-I might use that

13:18.005 --> 13:19.548
because Humpty Dumpty is a bop.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.634
People been bumpin'
that shit for centuries.

13:21.717 --> 13:22.676
So, thank you.
I appreciate that.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.639
And Reina got five million views
on her new video.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.850
-Five million views?
-Yup.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.978
-And she opening

-(scoffs)

13:33.062 --> 13:34.855

13:34.939 --> 13:36.482

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
Shawna,
don't be an asshole.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.322
How am I an asshole?
Because I don't think
her music is good?

13:43.405 --> 13:45.741
Her music is good
because I make her music,

13:45.824 --> 13:46.700
so the shit is objectively good.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.787
-(sighs)
-You just stay hatin' on shit.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.747
That's your only fuckin' mode
is just hatin' on some shit.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.874
No. I don't like
supporting bullshit.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.127
I supported your ass,
and you stole my fucking song.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.672
-I did not steal your fucking
song, Shawna. No, I didn't.
-Yes--

13:59.755 --> 14:01.006
I don't know if
you remember,

14:01.090 --> 14:03.133
but I paid you
for all your time.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.053
With! With money
that I ain't even have.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.930
I don't know if you recall,
but we was broke.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.724
Okay, you got money
now though, right?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.810
Why don't you just give me
the credit that I deserve?

14:12.893 --> 14:13.644
All you could fucking say

14:13.727 --> 14:16.564
was shit about
changing my whole shit!

14:16.647 --> 14:18.774
-And you're welcome.
-What are you talking about?

14:18.857 --> 14:19.900
I'm talking about the fact that

14:19.984 --> 14:21.569

you're doing.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.112

That was it, right?

You know who would be
really good on that?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.670
Reina Reign.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.380
-You're an asshole.
-I think she could be great.

14:41.463 --> 14:45.759

They didn't let us
finish our set
