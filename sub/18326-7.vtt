00:46.713 --> 00:48.339
[horns honking]

00:54.929 --> 00:56.723
[man over radio]
Here's the traffic report.

00:56.806 --> 01:00.060
Red lights for as far as you can see
on most city approaches.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.729
Come on! You gotta be kidding me.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.565
A study released today revealed
techno-stress can lead to irritability

01:05.648 --> 01:06.733
[dinging]

01:06.816 --> 01:08.777
and, in some cases, extreme rage.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.361
[GPS] Speed camera ahead.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.363
[man over radio] Here's a reminder
to our listeners

01:12.447 --> 01:14.282
-to take it easy out there.
-[groans]

01:14.365 --> 01:16.159
[Hawaiian music playing over radio]

01:20.663 --> 01:23.333
-[beeps]
-I wanna book a flight to Oahu.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.002
[phone] Okay, here's
what I found on the web

01:26.085 --> 01:28.004
for "I'd like to book a flight
to a Weibo."

01:28.588 --> 01:32.509
No, I'd like to book a flight to Oahu,
Hawaii.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.261
Okay, here's what I found on the web

01:35.345 --> 01:37.430
for "I'd like to book a flight
to a-while-who."

01:38.431 --> 01:40.391
-[yells] Damn it.
-[phone shatters]

01:43.394 --> 01:44.562
God damn!

01:44.646 --> 01:47.190
[GPS] In 300 feet, turn left.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.359
-I'm stationary.
-At the next roundabout,

01:49.442 --> 01:51.361
-turn right.
-Stop!

01:51.736 --> 01:52.904
Make a U-turn.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.614
[sensor beeping]

01:55.532 --> 01:58.409
You're too close!
You're too friggin' close!

02:02.664 --> 02:04.791
[stammering] Oh.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.209
[tires screech]

02:08.086 --> 02:09.420
[man screams]

02:13.508 --> 02:15.135
[siren wailing]

02:16.177 --> 02:19.097
[drone] Stop.
You've committed a moving violation

02:19.180 --> 02:20.974
and your identity has been recorded.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.434
We are texting you your ticket right now.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.480
Say "one" to pay now
or "two" to contest in court.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.275
[yells]

02:31.151 --> 02:33.695
[man] Paper jam?
I'll give you a paper jam.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.321
[all yelling]

02:42.078 --> 02:45.290
I didn't catch that. Say "one" to pay now
or "two" to contest in court.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.292
[man yells]

02:47.834 --> 02:50.712
I am just really anxious watching this.

02:50.795 --> 02:54.591
I have had days like that where it seems
like all the tech is out to get you.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.052
Yeah, there is definitely no shortage
of annoying technology.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.972
[Tory] In this White Rabbit Project,

03:01.055 --> 03:04.726
we're going down the rabbit hole
of irritating gadgets.

03:04.809 --> 03:05.768
Get it right!

03:05.852 --> 03:08.313
To find the most hated tech in the world.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.815
Under investigation:

03:11.733 --> 03:12.650
Drones...

03:14.444 --> 03:15.653
traffic lights...

03:16.070 --> 03:18.406
I feel like I'm hitting
every red light here.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.533
and things that go beep.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.413
It's high on my list of things
that I love to hate.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.372
[yells]

03:27.081 --> 03:30.001
[Tory]
As usual, we'll rank our six contenders

03:30.084 --> 03:32.378
by testing them against three criteria.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.299
Number one,
how long has the tech been annoying?

03:36.382 --> 03:40.803
Number two, how annoying is it
versus how useful it might be?

03:40.887 --> 03:45.558
And this one, is number three,
the potential to get worse.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.438
First up, I want to share with you one
of my personal pet peeves.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.944
Yup. Printers.

03:56.027 --> 04:00.073
Sent from hell and guaranteed to fail you
when you need them the most.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.122
[Grant] Where do I start?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.708
There is so much to hate
about these things.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.128
-Paper jams.
-Why does it say paper jam...

04:14.754 --> 04:18.383
when there is no paper jam?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.969
Unintelligible error codes.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.887
PC load letter?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.056
What does that mean?

04:25.640 --> 04:29.394
The sheer audacity of a printer
that won't print.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.896
I have a brown belt, dumbass!

04:41.447 --> 04:42.448
Hi-yah!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.952
Kind of makes you wish
for the good old days...

04:46.035 --> 04:50.206
before printers,
and the rage they created ever existed.

04:51.624 --> 04:56.045
A thousand years ago, most printing
was done with ink and a woodblock.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.672
Sure, it was slow,

04:57.755 --> 05:01.718
but no one in history ever lost
their cool over a "wood jam."

05:02.051 --> 05:05.722
Then in 1440,
along came the Gutenberg Press,

05:05.805 --> 05:08.808
one of the most important inventions
of all time.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.562
Suddenly, everyone had access
to written information.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.939
And printing had changed the world.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.608
But somewhere along the way,

05:17.692 --> 05:20.528
the printer became the invention
that ruined the world...

05:20.611 --> 05:22.905
or at least a good day at the office.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.580
So, what exactly is it
about printer problems

05:30.663 --> 05:34.876
that activates our primal rage
and pushes us to the breaking point?

05:35.168 --> 05:38.046
Well, I found a psychologist in England
who knows all about it,

05:38.129 --> 05:42.175
Dr. Lucy Beresford. Why do we get so mad
when printers don't work?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.553
Printers nowadays and office equipment,
in general,

05:45.636 --> 05:48.765
are usually designed
to be incredibly easy to use.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.351
As soon as there's a malfunction,
and you can't resolve it,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.228
you end up feeling helpless.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.775
When you feel helpless, you tend
to regress to childhood responses.

05:59.859 --> 06:04.072
It feels like a real battle,
which at that moment, we are losing.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.323
[woman sobs]

06:09.077 --> 06:13.956
Okay, so now I know
why the printer malfunctions piss us off,

06:14.373 --> 06:17.460
but why do they keep crapping out on us
in the first place?

06:17.543 --> 06:18.920
I need to know.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.008
[Grant] Now, this is a real American hero.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.303
Frank Burton runs
a printer repair service.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.849
And for the right price,
he'll go anywhere in Los Angeles County.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.436
I'm sure you see a lot of printers
in your daily life.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.272
Have you witnessed printer rage?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.357
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.860
You walk in, and they're smacking
their printer, kicking it, cursing at it.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.571
They physically pick it up, smash it.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.491
I've seen them shake the cartridges
all over the carpet.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.120
Then they wipe and damage the carpet,
and they get in trouble for that, too.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.706
-So it's just not me.
-No.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.585
Unfortunately,
it's a complicated piece of machinery.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.630
It has a lot of components
that can go bad and will go bad.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.758
So, most of the main problem is usually
the toner cartridge.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.676
[Grant] Okay.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.389
There are literally hundreds
of components under the hood.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.809
How about a nice paper jam?

07:14.892 --> 07:17.145
[laughing]

07:17.228 --> 07:20.481
We're deeper inside of a printer
than I've ever seen.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.317
-[Frank] That comes out like that.
-Okay.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.571
-[Frank] The paper pick-up roller.
-Paper pick-up roller.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.907
-Now Frank removes the printer's heart.
-Yeah.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.325
This is the main feeder unit.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.662
[Grant] And even
when all this works perfectly,

07:34.745 --> 07:37.165
there's the ultimate wild-card factor.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.792
-The paper.
-So, if you're gonna buy cheap paper,

07:39.876 --> 07:42.211
you're probably gonna have problems
with it.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.963
Right, you get what you pay for.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.340
Thanks a lot, Frank.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.718
Well, Frank's work here is done.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.137
As I watch him walk off into the sunset,

07:51.220 --> 07:54.640
I realize now how happy I am
not to have his job.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.477
Thanks, Mr. Printer-Fix-It-Man.

07:59.604 --> 08:03.649
All right, it turns out
that printers are complicated beasts.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.776
It's not always their fault
when they break.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.821
Does it make me hate them any less? No.

08:09.447 --> 08:13.284
There's another aspect of printers
that really gets under my skin.

08:15.703 --> 08:16.537
Printer ink.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.626
Here in Los Angeles,
I can fill my gas tank

08:21.709 --> 08:24.003
for about three dollars
and 50 cents a gallon.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.339
Coffee costs $32 a gallon.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.509
Sparkling wine, $650 a gallon.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.637
But plain, old black printer ink

08:32.720 --> 08:36.891
costs $2700 a gallon.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.810
Well, I am as mad as hell,

08:39.894 --> 08:42.563
and I'm not going to take it anymore.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.398
I'm gonna make my own ink.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.319
Actually, to save time,

08:48.569 --> 08:51.989
I'm just gonna scavenge ink
from some old ball-point pens.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.575
It's time for alcohol.

08:55.159 --> 08:58.913
That'll bind the ink tightly,
guaranteeing me smooth printouts.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.541
Insert the pens in the alcohol.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.125
Give it a good shake.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.923
And now comes the fun part.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.800
[laughing devilishly]

09:14.011 --> 09:16.973
It's time to insert your good-as-new,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.559
full cartridge into your printer.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.770
-That was easy.
-[beeps]

09:24.397 --> 09:26.774
And now for the results.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.152
Goddamn it.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.573
So, it turns out,
you can't make your own printer ink.

09:33.656 --> 09:38.077
There's a lot of sophisticated technology
that goes into it.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.330
The ink has to survive being vaporized,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.332
fired at 30 miles per hour

09:43.416 --> 09:46.752
through a nozzle a third the size
of a human hair,

09:46.836 --> 09:48.379
at 300 degrees.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.131
Three hundred degrees.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.300
Now, that gives me an idea.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.012
Instead of filling this printer with ink,

09:56.095 --> 09:59.765
why not inject it
with three ink-dyed accelerants?

10:03.394 --> 10:04.228
[beeps]

10:05.730 --> 10:07.356
Don't try this at home.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.159
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.369
Hey, is this Frank?

10:20.661 --> 10:23.497
Yeah, we got a problem here
with a printer.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.959
No, no, I don't think
it is the toner cartridge this time.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.253
[laughs] You hate printers.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.505
You might wanna see somebody
about that issue.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.758
I feel that was very therapeutic.

10:33.841 --> 10:37.136
Let's face it, how long
have printers really been that annoying?

10:37.219 --> 10:41.849
Well, the first inkjet came out in 1984,
the HP Thinkjet.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.935
Even the HP Museum says
it's unreliable.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.104
-Okay, roughly 30 years.
-Yeah.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.606
What are we supposed to do?

10:48.689 --> 10:51.317
Go back to the old days
and start writing with our hands?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.778
[Tory] I like the future.
I wanna stay.

10:54.278 --> 10:58.532
When it comes to annoyance
versus how useful they are,

10:58.616 --> 11:00.826
-It's a five out of ten.
-[Grant] All right.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.789
Finally, the potential to get worse.
We're going paperless. We've peaked right?

11:04.872 --> 11:08.417
-Okay, fine, so low to moderate.
-[Kari] Okay, all right.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.503
Don't you feel like someday,

11:10.586 --> 11:14.215
the skies are gonna be filled with drones
like plagues of locusts?

11:16.300 --> 11:19.011
[narrator] From the moment
it first takes to the air,

11:19.095 --> 11:23.099
this magnificent creature
is master of its domain.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.939
To behold one in the wild like this
is to witness one of nature's greatest--

11:30.022 --> 11:31.399
[gunshot]

11:35.027 --> 11:37.279
When I started seeing these things
flying around,

11:37.363 --> 11:40.282
I thought, "That is really cool.
What a neat piece of tech."

11:41.117 --> 11:42.827
What's not to like about it?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.746
If you really want to know,
so many things.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.833
You put the drone in the hands
of the wrong operator,

11:49.291 --> 11:52.503
it turns them into dangerous lunatics.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.257
[Kari] The truth is that out there
in drone land,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.050
there's plenty of pilots,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.470
but not many aces.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.681
And in the skate park,

12:03.764 --> 12:06.559
tots on scooters used
to be the biggest hazard.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.895
Not anymore.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.481
Then there's your frat-boy fringe.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.402
[both yelling]

12:18.070 --> 12:19.447
Drones, beer and fireworks.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.617
[laughs] What could possibly go wrong?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.746
You see what I'm saying?

12:27.747 --> 12:31.333
But mostly, we get ticked off
just 'cause they're there.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.920
[man] Hey, don't touch that!

12:36.005 --> 12:38.716
[Kari] No wonder people go medieval
on these things.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.973
And drone rage is only gonna get worse.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.811
Over the last year,
drone sales were up almost 84 percent.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.274
And then you have package delivery drones

12:55.357 --> 12:57.485
and pizza delivery drones
to look forward to.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.403
-Did you order a pizza?
-Yeah, come here.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.823
Thank you.
What do you think about drones?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.868
Uh, they suck.
They're gonna put me out of a job.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.246
Out of work. Taking jobs. See there?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.249
Drones aren't just annoying people.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.545
Check out this eagle who is taking names
and kicking some serious drone butt.

13:19.256 --> 13:22.968
And, in fact,
eagles are so innately anti-drone

13:23.052 --> 13:25.471
that crime fighters around the world
are turning to them

13:25.554 --> 13:28.849
to take out criminally driven drones.
I kid you not.

13:28.933 --> 13:33.062
This eagle has been specially trained
by the Dutch police for just that task.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.238
But if you haven't got an eagle handy,
don't worry.

13:43.489 --> 13:48.118
Hacker Samy Kamkar has come up
with another way to bring drones down.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.998
I started looking at drones
and found that they have no security.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.210
And I created something called SkyJack,
and what this is,

13:56.293 --> 14:00.005
is basically a mini-computer
and a special Wi-Fi card

14:00.089 --> 14:03.092
that can intercept
communication wirelessly

14:03.175 --> 14:04.593
of you and your drone.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.805
Wait, so you can
actually hijack the drone?

14:07.888 --> 14:12.476
Absolutely. It will actually interfere,
take over, disconnect their video,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.812
and then you have control of that drone.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.358
What?! Shut the front door.
This is much better than my garden hose,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.610
which is what I've been trying,
which is not working.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.446
Now, to test Samy's drone defense system,

14:25.030 --> 14:29.034
I'll fly this drone,
using an iPad as a controller.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.580
-I'm gonna take off. You ready?
-[Samy] Go ahead. Yeah.

14:32.663 --> 14:36.000
All right. So, you're now flying around.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.168
[laughs]

14:38.252 --> 14:39.253
Awesome.

14:41.338 --> 14:45.843
This guy's looking for the wireless signal
between the drone and your iPad.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.596
[Kari] And it's found it.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.639
Oh. My screen just froze.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.600
[Samy] "Control link not available."

14:52.683 --> 14:55.436
-[Kari] Oh, my gosh.
-It's actually taken over the drone.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.605
You have no ability to do anything.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.483
And it can either move it,
it can flip it, it can stop it.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.403
[Kari] Or, if you like,
bring it in for a gentle landing...

15:04.486 --> 15:06.071
before you stomp on it.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.117
So, you just, like,
fully took down my drone.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.286
Skyjacking a drone is cool,

15:12.369 --> 15:15.623
but it doesn't give me
that ultimate satisfaction...

15:15.706 --> 15:18.083
of just knocking a drone out of the sky.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.213
This British bazooka looks
like it could take down the Death Star,

15:25.090 --> 15:27.551
but its job is
to capture drones mid-flight.

15:32.514 --> 15:36.310
I think I can make a rough-and-ready
version that's just as effective.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.023
My drone-catcher-net-gun is
a DIY hardware store special.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.275
It's made
of plumbing parts glued together.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.111
The most important elements being
the pressure chamber,

15:46.195 --> 15:49.239
which we'll fill from 80 to 100 psi,

15:51.033 --> 15:55.329
the pressure release valve,
which is a modified sprinkler valve,

15:56.330 --> 15:59.041
and finally the net,
which is the funnest part of the gun

15:59.124 --> 16:02.002
because that's gonna
snatch the drones out of the sky.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.049
Say hello to my...

16:08.676 --> 16:10.719
large and somewhat awkward friend.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.888
Think I'll name her Annette.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.474
Okay, let's see if this works. Ready?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.398
I don't know if it'll catch the drone,
but it's going to do some damage.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.611
[narrator] Seeking safety
in the city's forgotten corners,

16:27.695 --> 16:30.739
it comes here, in the early evening,
to roost.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.206
But a master predator is on the prowl.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.458
The creature's mortal enemy.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.882
Armed with a sticky web,
she tempts it closer.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.685
Stunned and ensnared,
the creature is helpless.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.856
She will take it back to her nest...

17:04.356 --> 17:06.150
and put it in the bin.

17:08.694 --> 17:13.699
[Kari] Commercial drones have only been
around in any number for about four years,

17:13.782 --> 17:15.909
so not high on criteria one.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.537
And although they are super annoying,

17:18.620 --> 17:20.873
I have to admit,
they're also darn useful...

17:22.499 --> 17:23.917
for fire-fighting...

17:26.003 --> 17:27.463
filming TV shows...

17:28.589 --> 17:31.592
even as responders
at medical emergencies.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.844
That cuts down their score
in criteria two.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.056
But potential to get worse...
Off the Richter.

17:37.139 --> 17:41.769
By 2020, there'll be seven million drones
flying the American skies.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.271
That's about two per square mile.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.150
[Tory] No doubt,
drones are a strong candidate

17:48.233 --> 17:50.027
for most hated tech of our times,

17:50.110 --> 17:53.822
but I think my first contender
might be even more annoying.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.577
I wanna book a flight to Oahu.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.246
[phone] Okay,
here's what I found on the web

18:01.330 --> 18:03.499
for "I'd like to book a flight
to a-while-who."

18:03.999 --> 18:06.585
-God damn!
-[Tory] I can totally relate to that.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.212
What the hell?

18:08.295 --> 18:12.549
It's so frustrating. So, my contender
for technology you love to hate:

18:12.841 --> 18:14.176
Machines that talk.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.720
Especially the ones
that want to have a conversation.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.638
[ringing]

18:17.721 --> 18:19.598
You're a little nervous, aren't you?

18:19.681 --> 18:22.976
[phone] You know what they say, a light
can travel halfway around the world,

18:23.060 --> 18:25.437
while the truth is still getting
its pants on.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.689
I'm not sure I get it, but it's funny.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.984
-What? Did you hear that?
-[man laughs]

18:33.320 --> 18:37.157
[Tory] One of the first attempts
to replicate the human voice was Euphonia,

18:37.241 --> 18:41.120
created in the 1800s
by German inventor Joseph Faber.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.873
Her lips and rubber tongue were controlled
by piano keys,

18:44.957 --> 18:47.126
while a bellows acted as her lungs.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.044
She spoke in several languages,

18:49.128 --> 18:52.673
and could belt out a creepy version
of "God Save the Queen."

18:53.382 --> 18:57.719
♪ God save our gracious Queen ♪

18:58.262 --> 19:01.140
[Tory] Faber spent 25 years
developing Euphonia,

19:01.223 --> 19:03.100
but the public were creeped out.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.893
[crowd booing and hissing]

19:07.146 --> 19:09.106
And Faber totally lost it.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.111
[man] "Mr. Faber, the ingenious inventor
of the talking machine,

19:14.194 --> 19:18.407
totally destroyed it the other day
in a fit of temporary derangement."

19:22.744 --> 19:26.498
[Tory] A hundred years after
that first case of "talking machine" rage,

19:26.582 --> 19:30.169
Bell Telephone debuted their "Voder"
at the New York World Fair.

19:30.878 --> 19:35.257
The machine uses only two sounds,
produced electrically.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.843
One of these represents the breath:

19:37.926 --> 19:39.136
[static noise]

19:39.511 --> 19:41.763
The other, the vibration
of the vocal cords:

19:42.222 --> 19:43.515
[humming noise]

19:44.141 --> 19:47.477
[Tory] Played together,
and Voder really came to life.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.189
[Voder] She saw me.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.693
[Tory] Voder could even throw
in some human-like speech inflection.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.571
-[man] Who saw you?
-[Voder] She saw me.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.949
-Whom did she see?
-She saw me.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.912
That's when the machine-that-can-talk
infestation began.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.456
People started thinking
of all sorts of ways

20:07.539 --> 20:09.458
to put the synthesized voice to work.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.379
[man over phone] You have dialed
The Nutjob Utility Company.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.926
-I'm gonna put it on speaker phone.
-If you want to pay a bill,

20:19.009 --> 20:20.802
press one or say "one."

20:21.511 --> 20:22.930
Automated answering services

20:23.013 --> 20:25.891
are another reason
I hate talking machines.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.352
-They're so frustrating.
-If you have paid your bill,

20:28.852 --> 20:31.271
but service has not been reconnected,
press four.

20:31.355 --> 20:35.234
It would be so much easier and quicker
just to talk to a human being.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.694
I got a simple question,
it'll take two seconds.

20:38.278 --> 20:42.783
If you want to speak to an operator,
press seven or say, "Operator."

20:43.408 --> 20:45.202
-Operator.
-Sorry,

20:45.285 --> 20:46.995
we didn't hear what you said.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.832
Please hold the line
for the next available operator.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.585
[lounge music playing over phone]

20:56.713 --> 20:59.466
[Tory] Hmm. I wonder
if I have time to get a snack.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.473
[bell ringing]

21:07.224 --> 21:09.977
I'm "hangry" right now,
and I would love to get some food.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.521
Find me the closest taco shop.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.733
[phone] Here's what I could find
on how to make taco shells.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.653
No, not a recipe for taco shells.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.990
Now, not only does
the machine talk to you,

21:23.073 --> 21:24.366
but you can talk to it.

21:24.449 --> 21:28.745
And it's supposed to understand you.
However, this does get doubly frustrating.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.663
Why?

21:30.872 --> 21:31.957
I'll tell you why.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.211
Understanding the human language
is something that comes easy to us,

21:36.628 --> 21:40.215
but that's one of the hardest things
to teach to a machine.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.094
Give me directions to a taco shop.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.682
-A taco is a snack food of Mexican origin.
-No, not the definition of a taco.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.476
I know I should give voice recognition
some slack.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.021
I mean, it has to push through
the uhs and ums,

21:54.104 --> 21:55.480
and all the accents,

21:55.564 --> 21:59.776
and all those same-sounding words
with totally different definitions.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.779
However, sometimes,
I'm just like, "Get it right!"

22:03.780 --> 22:05.949
[man over phone]
Thanks for holding, how can I help you?

22:07.117 --> 22:09.244
Sir? Hello?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.246
[lounge music resumes]

22:11.913 --> 22:13.373
Interesting side note...

22:13.457 --> 22:17.878
All GPS navigation systems
automatically default to a female voice.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.923
A Stanford study shows
that humans are biologically programmed

22:22.007 --> 22:24.718
to respond better to a woman's voice
than a man's.

22:25.302 --> 22:29.389
All right, where's the taco shop?
Left? Right? You understand me?

22:29.473 --> 22:33.643
Even the simplest request seems
to be a huge challenge.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.981
You gonna give me
the silent treatment, huh? Hello.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.734
Just like all the women in my life. Heh.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.320
I think I might be better off
without you.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.156

22:55.165 --> 22:59.503
[recording] Thank you for holding.
Your call is important to us.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.465
Is it really important to you?
If it was so important,

23:03.548 --> 23:06.885
I would be talking to a human being
and not a stupid recording.

23:08.095 --> 23:11.014
If you want to speak to an operator,
press seven.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.933
[Tory] Okay, let's score talking machines.

23:13.016 --> 23:16.228
Now, they've been annoying us
since at least the invention of Voder,

23:16.311 --> 23:17.771
77 years ago.

23:17.854 --> 23:21.191
-[Voder] She saw me.
-[Tory] How annoying?

23:21.274 --> 23:24.486
Well, when we have to deal
with robot phone calls...

23:25.487 --> 23:28.407
-irritating talking navigators...
-[GPS] Recalculating.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.741
You're killing me.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.452
[Tory]
and substandard speech recognition...

23:32.536 --> 23:34.830
No, not a recipe for taco salad.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.916
the rage index, eight out of ten.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.585
Finally, are they gonna get worse?

23:40.669 --> 23:43.213
Well, we're definitely gonna have
more machines talking

23:43.296 --> 23:45.215
-and listening to us in the future.
-Hi.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.466
Sophia here.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.511
I'm not sure I know
what it really means to be human.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.848
[Tory] But like Sophia,
made by Hanson Robotics,

23:52.931 --> 23:54.474
they're gonna be better at it.

23:55.142 --> 23:58.937
Would you like to play Rock-Paper-Scissors
with me robot-style?

23:59.020 --> 24:03.024
[Tory] There'll be more talking machines,
but they'll be less annoying.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.569
So, a mid-range score.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.614
Well done, I'm very impressed
with your performance here today.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.869
[Grant] Okay, so talking machines
can be annoying...

24:13.952 --> 24:16.580
but in the modern world
there's another sound

24:16.663 --> 24:18.540
that makes my blood boil.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.209
[alarm clock beeping]

24:23.128 --> 24:25.088
[beeping noises]

24:25.589 --> 24:28.633
It's an irritating constant
in the soundtrack of our lives.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.511
And it annoys the [alarm blaring]
out of me.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.722
The dreaded beep.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.851
It's high on my list of things
that I love to hate.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.063
But you know what?
We didn't always have beeps.

24:42.147 --> 24:42.981
[bell rings]

24:43.064 --> 24:45.400
Once, church bells rang across the valley.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.235
Trains whistled.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.196
Clocks chimed.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.364
And in between...

24:53.283 --> 24:55.243
there was sweet silence.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.162
[beeping noises]

24:57.245 --> 25:00.749
Now, some of us have
to endure 1000 beeps per day.

25:02.751 --> 25:06.129
And the big question is why?
Why the beep?

25:06.713 --> 25:10.675
How did it replace simpler devices
like the buzzer, the horn, the bell?

25:12.260 --> 25:16.223
And the answer is
piezoelectric technology and transistors.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.641
Both electronic breakthroughs

25:17.724 --> 25:19.976
that were perfected
right after World War II.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.770
It's simple, check it out.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.065
This is a piezoelectric speaker.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.359
Inside of it...

25:27.859 --> 25:31.488
is a disc just like this.
Totally flat, no moving parts.

25:31.571 --> 25:35.075
All we have to do
is pulse a voltage to it, like this:

25:35.158 --> 25:36.201
[beeping]

25:37.327 --> 25:39.704
And voila... you get a beep.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.084
Now, because it was cheap
and easily scalable,

25:44.167 --> 25:45.835
the beep began to appear in devices

25:45.919 --> 25:47.921
from the smallest
all the way to the largest.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.717
Even making the leap
into the final frontier.

25:54.094 --> 25:58.014
In October 1957,
the Soviets launched Sputnik.

25:58.640 --> 26:04.729
This tiny satellite beeped continually
as it orbited the Earth every 98 minutes.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.901
Beeping ground zero these days...
the hospital.

26:10.568 --> 26:13.863
Where dozens of hi-tech gadgets
compete for our attention.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.367
Most aren't even doing it
for any good reason.

26:17.951 --> 26:22.539
Studies show only about three percent of
hospital alarms are for critical events.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.165
[EKG flatlining]

26:24.249 --> 26:27.335
And by the way,
do we really want this:

26:28.336 --> 26:30.380
to be the last sound we hear on Earth?

26:31.965 --> 26:36.219
Then there's construction sites,
where beeps have become so ever-present,

26:36.720 --> 26:39.597
workers aren't even alerted,
they're just annoyed.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.892
The beeping is so loud that OSHA,

26:42.976 --> 26:45.645
the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration,

26:45.729 --> 26:49.983
mandates that construction site workers
have to wear ear protection.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.986
So, essentially,
they're trying to block out

26:53.069 --> 26:55.739
the very sound
that's beeping to protect them.

26:57.615 --> 26:58.742
Check out what happens

26:58.825 --> 27:01.703
when we test reversing beeps
on the general public.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.038
[van beeping]

27:04.247 --> 27:05.874
Almost nothing.

27:06.583 --> 27:10.337
They're so used to hearing them,
they don't even react.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.799
And the other thing about beeps,
because they're low frequency,

27:14.883 --> 27:17.719
it's really hard to tell
where they're coming from.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.139
Let me demonstrate...

27:21.890 --> 27:23.808
using four guys with anger issues...

27:25.268 --> 27:27.604
and one unwitting test subject.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.482
I got this shield for you, right?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.275
-I have a shield?
-You got a shield.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.278
The experiment is simple.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.156
Each man has a speaker beside him

27:38.239 --> 27:41.493
from which I'll randomly blast
a loud back-up beep.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.622
Tory then has one second
to try to pick the direction

27:45.705 --> 27:47.040
and defend himself.

27:47.832 --> 27:48.833
Stand right there.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.503
Okay. I'm also gonna play
some construction noise.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.255
It's supposed
to be like a construction site.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.635
Because the beep
is so difficult to locate,

27:58.802 --> 28:01.638
I predict Tory's headed
for the Hurt Locker.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.141
-All right, everybody ready?
-[Tory] No.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.353
I'm gonna start the construction noise.
Here we go.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.230
[beeping noises]

28:10.313 --> 28:11.147
Aw, shi--

28:12.732 --> 28:14.943
-Beginner's luck.
-[laughs] This sucks.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.991
[laughs] Now he's feeling the pain.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.159
[Tory yelling]

28:23.952 --> 28:25.203
[Tory] Goddamn it.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.706
Oh, mother--

28:28.790 --> 28:29.666
[Grant laughing]

28:36.631 --> 28:39.467
Okay, don't worry, don't worry.
It's over, it's over.

28:39.884 --> 28:44.597
-So, what'd you think?
-Uh, it sucked, but I like the idea.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.976
I mean, it was very hard to pinpoint
where the sounds were coming.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.104
Especially
once the background noise came in.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.065
[Grant] See? Beeps don't even work.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.736
What we need is a sound
that's less irritating.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.320
And more locatable.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.740
And it already exists.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.201
This is a commercially available
white-noise back-up alarm,

29:05.702 --> 29:08.621
and it just might save the human race
from beeping hell.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.248
Here's what it sounds like:

29:12.125 --> 29:14.294
[static hissing intermittently]

29:15.754 --> 29:17.213
Not entirely soothing,

29:17.297 --> 29:20.175
but it's certainly not as piercing
as a back-up beep.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.718
Here's the advantage:

29:22.218 --> 29:25.764
It's locatable, so you know
exactly where it's coming from.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.391
Allow Tory to demonstrate.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.309
Get ready.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.312
Instead of playing beeps
out of each speaker,

29:32.395 --> 29:34.939
this time we'll play white noise.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.109
Stand by.
I'm starting the construction noise.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.111
[construction and static noises]

29:50.330 --> 29:53.041
It looks like
suddenly Tory's got crazy Jedi powers,

29:53.708 --> 29:55.543
but all he's using are his ears.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.923
[whoops]

30:03.593 --> 30:04.677
Okay. Uh...

30:05.261 --> 30:07.096
Know what? I think we proved your point.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.015
-I think it works!
-[laughing]

30:09.599 --> 30:10.642
Oh!

30:10.725 --> 30:12.185
That was awesome.

30:12.268 --> 30:15.522
With the beeping noise it sounded like
it was coming from every part of the room,

30:15.605 --> 30:19.317
but with the white noise, I could tell
which direction it was coming from.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.402
Yeah, you had 100 percent accuracy.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.321
What a great experiment.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.322
Congrats, man.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.700
All right, now I just gotta think
of an experiment I'm gonna use you in.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.910
[Kari laughs]

30:28.993 --> 30:31.371
-Uh-oh. You're in trouble.
-Yeah.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.541
All right, let's score this one.
How long have beeps been annoying?

30:34.624 --> 30:36.709
Well, the mid-'80s was really
the digital age

30:36.793 --> 30:38.503
when they started
to put beeps in everything,

30:38.586 --> 30:40.755
so I'll say probably about 30 years.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.551
Secondly, their usefulness
versus their annoying factor?

30:45.134 --> 30:48.471
There are definitely useful beeps
out there like smoke detectors,

30:48.555 --> 30:51.933
but the great majority of beeps
in the world are totally gratuitous.

30:52.016 --> 30:52.851
True.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.936
So, probably super high in that category.

30:55.019 --> 30:58.314
All right, criteria three,
in the future will it get more annoying?

30:58.398 --> 31:01.568
The fact the white noise actually worked
better than the beep...

31:01.651 --> 31:05.113
I say it's gonna be less annoying,
more effective, this is good.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.742
[Tory] While the days of the beep
might be numbered...

31:10.910 --> 31:13.162
my next candidate
is going nowhere in a hurry.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.542
Everybody knows that traffic
is the bane of modern existence.

31:18.668 --> 31:21.588
But I've focused my considerable anger
on the one thing

31:21.671 --> 31:23.798
that seems to constantly stop me dead.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.011
Traffic lights. I hate them.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.639
Every single light,

31:31.723 --> 31:33.850
I feel like I'm hitting
every red light here.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.147
Did you know that drivers are estimated

31:39.230 --> 31:42.233
to spend six months of their lives
waiting at traffic lights?

31:42.317 --> 31:43.693
[Tory groans]

31:45.194 --> 31:47.947
We actually consume
17 percent more fuel

31:48.031 --> 31:52.285
and create 15 percent more emissions
stuck at traffic lights.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.956
Red lights are torturing drivers
all over the world.

31:59.125 --> 32:03.004
[in an English accent] In some parts
of Britain, it's plain bonkers.

32:03.504 --> 32:07.926
[normal voice] This single intersection
in Yorkshire has 42 traffic lights.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.261
Now, that's what I call
a red light district.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.932
And when they all failed one day,
locals said traffic flowed better.

32:15.224 --> 32:16.225
Here in Los Angeles,

32:16.309 --> 32:18.978
I'm about to take
my traffic light rage to the top.

32:19.812 --> 32:22.231
The L.A. Department of Transportation.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.819
As soon as I get through these lights.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.408
-Hey, Ed!
-Hey, Tory. How are you doing?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.369
How are you?
Thank you for letting me come.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.747
Edward Yu is in charge
of this underground bunker

32:38.373 --> 32:41.918
that monitors and controls
the city's 4600 traffic lights.

32:43.544 --> 32:46.130
So, this is the entire city
of Los Angeles?

32:46.214 --> 32:48.299
Yep. All the green dots represent signals

32:48.383 --> 32:51.344
that we have online.
And we can, uh, bring up...

32:51.886 --> 32:53.721
a graphical representation
of the intersection.

32:53.805 --> 32:54.764
[Tory] Oh, cool.

32:55.848 --> 33:01.437
In real time, Ed's team can check traffic
using one of 500 intersection cameras,

33:01.521 --> 33:04.524
or with car-detecting devices
buried in the road.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.443
They're actually magnetic induction loops,

33:07.527 --> 33:10.989
so basically, there's a wire in the ground
and it creates a magnetic field.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.950
So, right now I see it's blinking red,
what do those represent?

33:14.534 --> 33:17.620
That means there's some kind of congestion
on that particular lane.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.623
So, it could be a vehicle stuck,
or it could be a bad loop,

33:20.707 --> 33:23.167
-it could be different things happening.
-Or a puppy in the road.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.211
Puppy in the road.
Whatever you want, Tory.

33:25.294 --> 33:27.672
-Right. I don't want a puppy in the road.
-[laughs]

33:28.589 --> 33:33.094
This system has reduced delays
in L.A. intersections by 12 percent.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.931
And it could also bring everything
to a grinding halt.

33:38.057 --> 33:41.060
So, we can literally stop traffic
right now if we wanted to.

33:41.144 --> 33:44.147
[laughs] That's one of the things
that we kind of stay away from.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.149
Like it'd be kind of funny, right?

33:46.232 --> 33:48.901
I mean, it wouldn't be,
but in my head it would be funny.

33:48.985 --> 33:53.114
If we could, like, just cause, like,
the biggest traffic jam in history.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.699
I'm sure the citizens of L.A. are happy

33:54.782 --> 33:56.909
that I'm running this place
versus you, Tory.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.369
[both laugh]

33:59.537 --> 34:02.123
Now I've seen
this sophisticated network in action,

34:02.206 --> 34:05.793
I realize, I don't hate traffic lights,
I just hate red lights.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.338
It turns out another high-tech solution,
pioneered here in L.A.,

34:09.922 --> 34:12.592
means you can
actually avoid them altogether.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.093
Well, in theory.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.721
Now, in 2013,

34:16.804 --> 34:20.099
L.A. introduced
synchronized traffic lights.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.477
Now, the theory is,
you could drive from Western

34:22.560 --> 34:26.397
all the way down to San Pedro waterfront,
which is 30 miles,

34:26.898 --> 34:28.566
without even stopping.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.526
[engine starts]

34:31.152 --> 34:33.946
Now, I'm gonna take that drive
and see if it's even possible.

34:36.407 --> 34:39.118
All right,
so as soon as this light turns green...

34:39.619 --> 34:40.620
the test begins.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.663
[engine revving]

34:52.715 --> 34:54.801
All right, coming up on Sunset,
here we go.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.345
And it's green.

34:58.012 --> 35:00.181
Go, go, go!

35:01.724 --> 35:05.103
Made it through the first intersection,
so far, so good!

35:09.023 --> 35:11.317
We're approaching Fountain,
and the light's green.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.152
I'm going right through it.

35:13.653 --> 35:18.282
Now, the average speed of L.A. traffic
is just 17.3 miles per hour.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.871
I'm not traveling much faster than that.
But you know what? I don't care.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.541
As long as those green lights
keep coming my way.

35:28.501 --> 35:32.338
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
Traffic's getting a little heavy.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.843
Coming up
on the Santa Monica Boulevard...

35:37.343 --> 35:39.637
And... I'm through!

35:41.931 --> 35:45.351
One thing I'm noticing,
is people who are in the right lane

35:45.434 --> 35:49.230
making right-hand turns
are definitely causing little backups.

35:49.313 --> 35:53.359
But so far I've been able to make it
through every single intersection.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.114
Coming up onto Romaine.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.949
And I'm through.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.412
Oh, my God.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.248
What's driving me crazy now
is this person in front of me

36:07.331 --> 36:08.708
-is going slow.
-[horn honks]

36:08.791 --> 36:11.210
Go the speed limit
so I can make it through the light.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.925
Coming up onto Melrose and...

36:19.510 --> 36:20.595
my first red light.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.432
And so my dream run comes to an end

36:24.515 --> 36:27.602
because some drivers
just won't do the speed limit.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.648
Now, this idea of synchronizing the lights
is a great idea.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.735
In fact,
I got through six major intersections

36:35.818 --> 36:38.988
without hitting a red light.
However, it's not foolproof.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.908
There's one element
that they didn't factor in

36:41.991 --> 36:43.868
and that is the human element.

36:44.869 --> 36:49.832
Luckily, I've invented an amazing product
that will reduce that human error factor.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.961
[announcer] Has this happened to you?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.296
[groans]

36:55.379 --> 36:58.424
Pulling up behind a driver
who's asleep at the wheel,

36:58.507 --> 37:02.011
or too preoccupied
to apply their left turn signal?

37:02.803 --> 37:04.138
Now you're stuck behind them.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.849
It's enough to make you lose it.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.685
[announcer] At last, there's a solution.

37:11.479 --> 37:15.149
Lil' Mister,
Trunk-Based Driver Reminder Buddy!

37:15.650 --> 37:17.276
Just power him up...

37:17.818 --> 37:19.028
send him out...

37:19.612 --> 37:20.863
[Tory over speaker] Wake up.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.949
[announcer] and remind those motorists...

37:23.032 --> 37:25.743
[Tory over speaker] Excuse me,
could you put your blinker on?

37:25.826 --> 37:28.371
[announcer] how they should be driving.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.707
Endorsed by
White Rabbit Project's Kari Byron.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.753
These devices are awesome,
I love these smart gadgets.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.381
[announcer] Don't wait, call now!

37:39.632 --> 37:40.549
[all laugh]

37:40.633 --> 37:43.511
All right, there is a lot
to be annoyed by traffic lights.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.721
Okay, let's break it down,
so we can score it.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.765
One, how long have they been annoying?

37:47.848 --> 37:51.269
The first light was installed
150 years ago in London,

37:51.352 --> 37:52.645
and it was gas-powered.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.398
I mean, how annoying could it be
if there was only one?

37:55.481 --> 37:57.024
Well, a month later it exploded,

37:57.108 --> 38:00.194
injuring the policemen operating it.
So, I'd say pretty annoying.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.655
Uh, how about criteria number two?

38:02.738 --> 38:05.574
How annoying is it
versus how useful it might be?

38:05.658 --> 38:08.536
Trying to drive through a city
and getting stopped at every light,

38:08.619 --> 38:09.745
it's so frustrating.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.541
Yeah, but for safety and traffic flow
it's a necessary evil,

38:13.624 --> 38:14.667
so its gonna score low.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.461
-Finally, potential to get worse?
-That's the good news.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.797
Traffic lights
are becoming more efficient,

38:19.880 --> 38:22.758
which means you'll be spending less time
stopped at a light.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.219
So, for number three, they rank low.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.515
[Kari] So, traffic lights could get
less annoying in the future.

38:30.599 --> 38:34.020
But my final contender
is set to get much worse.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.731
[man] Hi. My name's Jim.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.483
My addiction took me to the gutter.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.736
It cost me my job.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.282
But then I found this place
and now I'm four years clean, as of today.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.659
-[man] Ah, well done, Jim.
-Thank you.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.618
Yeah.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.833
Hi. Welcome. Please, come in.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.209
Please.

38:59.545 --> 39:00.588
Have a seat.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.006
Hi.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.009
-Would you like to share?
-Okay, um...

39:05.718 --> 39:07.219
Hi, I'm Jane.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.596
[all] Hi, Jane.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.183
Last night I hit rock bottom.

39:14.935 --> 39:18.606
I went to go to bed,
and my husband was there.

39:23.986 --> 39:25.905
And that's when I realized...

39:29.033 --> 39:30.826
I hadn't done my 10,000 steps.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.039
[stammering]

39:38.417 --> 39:40.586
I'm Jane, I'm a stepaholic.

39:40.669 --> 39:41.504
Well done.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.300
My candidate for tech that I love to hate

39:46.384 --> 39:48.219
are gadgets
that are getting too smart.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.472
[Kari] And trying to take over our lives!

39:52.014 --> 39:54.850
For instance, wearable fitness monitors.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.020
A watch that counts your steps
and challenges you to compete

39:58.104 --> 40:01.482
with your friends
on how much you run or walk in a day.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.526
They've become so compelling

40:03.609 --> 40:07.696
that some users are claiming
to be addicted to their smart tech.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.991
[sobbing] I've just lost
all control over it.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.287
Okay, I know what you're thinking,
smart gadgets are awesome.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.581
And you're right.
For the last ten or 15 years,

40:17.665 --> 40:19.500
they've been adding features
to my phone

40:19.583 --> 40:24.463
like e-mailing, surfing the web, texting,
storing pictures, streaming music...

40:24.547 --> 40:26.090
But then things started
to get a little weird.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.884
My phone knows my routine,
knows my friends nicknames,

40:28.968 --> 40:30.678
it knows where I am
and tells people about it.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.596
It knows what I shop for.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.183
And now it's starting
to suggest how to live my life.

40:37.059 --> 40:40.271
[phone] Kari, it's been three weeks,
isn't it time you had a haircut?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.314
And it's not just the phones.

40:44.191 --> 40:47.403
[Kari] We've all been sold on the idea
that one day we'll live contently

40:47.486 --> 40:49.405
in a so-called smart home.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.033
Machines will take care of everything.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.744
-[machine] Welcome home, Stan.
-Thank you, good to be home.

40:56.829 --> 40:57.788
[Kari] Our diet.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.125
[machine] Feels like you put on
half a pound today.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.084
Great, thanks.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.294
[Kari] Our laundry.

41:03.377 --> 41:06.422
[machine] Four more days
until your coat needs dry cleaning.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.425
What would I do without you?
I feel like a beer.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.342
[Kari] Our health.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.012
[machine] Remember,
you gained half a pound today, Stan.

41:13.095 --> 41:16.557
-I recommend an alternative.
-Hmm. Okay.

41:17.391 --> 41:19.643
Fridge vegetable crisper reports...

41:20.060 --> 41:21.437
half a bunch of kale.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.107
What would you like to watch?

41:25.191 --> 41:26.275
Give me something fun.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.071
Oh, I love this show!

41:31.989 --> 41:32.823
Great.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.742
[Kari] Before long,
we could be letting machines

41:34.825 --> 41:36.744
do all of our thinking for us.

41:36.827 --> 41:40.164
[machine] I see your blood pressure
is slightly elevated.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.415
Try to relax.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.709
What can I say,
kale gets me excited.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.463
[Kari] So, we're letting these devices
start to take over our lives.

41:47.588 --> 41:50.174
I feel like as they take over our homes
and they get even smarter,

41:50.257 --> 41:52.843
they're gonna move
from servants to bosses.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.889
I've got a hunch
that the more tech rules our lives...

41:57.473 --> 41:59.683
-[machine] Welcome home, Stan.
-Whatever.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.269
[Kari] the more useless
us humans are gonna feel.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.522
[machine] Feels like you put on
half a pound today.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.440
Just open the door.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.651
I'd kill for a beer.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.778
I'm afraid you're out of beer, Stan.

42:10.861 --> 42:11.904
Why didn't you warn me?

42:12.738 --> 42:16.742
[Kari] Smart gadgets will end up
making us feel dumber and angrier.

42:17.409 --> 42:18.244
Not kale.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.454
No more freaking kale!

42:22.373 --> 42:23.582
Turn the TV on.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.001
[Kari] Because they know everything
about us,

42:26.085 --> 42:29.213
these gadgets are a serious security risk.

42:29.296 --> 42:32.883
The real problem here
is that all of these devices collecting

42:32.967 --> 42:35.761
and sharing all of our data
is gonna leave us vulnerable.

42:35.844 --> 42:37.513
Give me something fun to watch.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.599
Oh, not this crap again.

42:41.183 --> 42:44.103
I know this show's bigger than Jesus,
but please.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.480
[Kari] Recently,
there was a media fuss

42:46.564 --> 42:49.316
about a major brand voice-activated TV

42:49.900 --> 42:53.112
listening into your living room
family conversations.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.531
So, all that info smart tech is gathering,

42:55.614 --> 42:59.827
if it ends in the hands of a hacker
or say, an overbearing government agency,

42:59.910 --> 43:01.579
say goodbye to your privacy.

43:02.496 --> 43:04.915
Okay, in terms of scoring,
these smart gadgets

43:04.999 --> 43:08.711
have been oversharing info
for about five years.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.337
How long has the tech been annoying?

43:10.421 --> 43:12.131
Not too bad yet, I'll admit,

43:12.214 --> 43:15.843
but tech is gonna get smarter
and more controlling fast.

43:17.344 --> 43:20.139
Let's imagine a worst case-scenario.

43:20.222 --> 43:24.727
[machine] Please drink more slowly
to maximize absorption of anti-oxidants.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.478
I told you to leave me alone.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.606
[man over radio]
There's something going on in Sector 16.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.483
[machine] I see your blood pressure
is slightly elevated.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.985
-Try to relax.
-I wonder why!

43:33.569 --> 43:35.696
[man] We got a code yellow
for Stan Ian Dickson,

43:35.779 --> 43:38.115
12605 Gardenia Grove, over.

43:38.574 --> 43:43.078
[machine] You have been sitting for
five hours and 16 minutes already today.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.539
-I recommend you stay upright...
-I warned you!

43:45.623 --> 43:49.043
until the end of this episode.
Don't pick up that bat, Stan.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.546
You have violated Order 326B.

43:52.630 --> 43:53.547
Here's Johnny!

43:54.006 --> 43:55.924
It's a Code Red. Move, move, move.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.886
-Government agents have been notified.
-[laughs]

43:59.970 --> 44:01.180
Think about it, Stan.

44:02.389 --> 44:03.932
You can't survive without me.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.517
[yells]

44:05.601 --> 44:06.977
[siren chirps]

44:09.647 --> 44:11.857
[Kari] Okay, maybe I'm being
a bit paranoid.

44:13.484 --> 44:18.072
But my point is, we should be careful
exactly how smart we make our devices,

44:18.155 --> 44:20.407
and how their smartness
threatens our privacy.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.492
I want a lawyer!

44:22.409 --> 44:25.663
With an estimated
50 billion Internet-enabled devices

44:25.746 --> 44:27.665
running our lives by 2020...

44:28.707 --> 44:33.462
there's a huge potential for this
annoying smart tech to get way worse.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.384
[machine] Humans can be so ungrateful.

44:39.426 --> 44:42.554
Do you really hate smart tech that much?

44:42.971 --> 44:46.058
No, I love the tech,
I love the innovation,

44:46.141 --> 44:50.145
I just think we need to be careful
about letting machines take over.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.272
You know what?
Actually, I'm with you there.

44:52.856 --> 44:56.777
It's time for us to find out
which tech is the most hated.

44:58.112 --> 45:00.072
[Kari] After applying
our three criteria...

45:01.198 --> 45:02.866
how long they've been annoying...

45:05.327 --> 45:06.995
and potential to get worse...

45:08.122 --> 45:10.124
here's how the six contenders rank.

45:11.542 --> 45:12.876
Buzzing in at number six:

45:13.877 --> 45:14.795
Drones.

45:16.463 --> 45:20.509
It's predicted that they'll be
swarming our skies in the future,

45:20.592 --> 45:23.095
but they're just not annoying enough. Yet.

45:24.221 --> 45:28.058
At number five, the tech that launched
a million office tantrums:

45:28.559 --> 45:29.435
The printer.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.437
Why does it say paper jam?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.648
They've been driving us nuts
for over 30 years.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.484
But as paper-use declines
and tech gets better,

45:38.026 --> 45:40.612
their most annoying days
are probably in the past.

45:44.032 --> 45:46.827
Coming in at number four:
Too smart tech.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.121
[machine] Welcome home, Stan.
-Thank you, good to be home.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.000
[Kari] It's poised to really start
taking control of us

45:53.083 --> 45:55.252
and revealing
our deepest secrets in the future.

45:55.335 --> 45:57.629
-What would I do without you?
-Say goodbye to your privacy.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.965
So, don't say you haven't been warned.

46:00.841 --> 46:03.385
Flashing in at number three:
Traffic lights.

46:04.386 --> 46:06.138
I feel like
I'm hitting every red light here.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.391
Tormenting motorists for almost 150 years,

46:09.725 --> 46:12.853
they top the rankings
for how long they've been annoying.

46:13.437 --> 46:17.733
But L.A.'s synched signals give us hope
for a freer flowing future.

46:18.233 --> 46:21.487
Made it through the first intersection.
So far, so good.

46:22.821 --> 46:25.866
Raising alarms and stress levels
at number two: Beeps.

46:27.493 --> 46:30.329
They scored sky-high
in the annoying stakes.

46:31.747 --> 46:36.877
So, the sooner white noise rains
on their beeping parade, the better.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.087
-[laughing]
-This sucks.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.132
Finally, at number one:

46:42.966 --> 46:45.928
Those try-hard humans,
the talking machines.

46:46.512 --> 46:49.139
[recording] If you want to speak
to an operator, press seven.

46:49.223 --> 46:52.017
[Kari] We've never really gotten along
with machines that talk

46:52.100 --> 46:53.268
and try to understand us.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.728
[man] Who saw you?

46:54.811 --> 46:56.355
[Voder] She saw me.

46:56.939 --> 47:00.150
-[Kari] And maybe we never will.
-Get it right!

47:05.239 --> 47:07.699
-Yes, machine talk!
-Oh... What?

47:08.283 --> 47:10.702
You know what, beeps have to rate higher.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.705
They are so annoying
and they've been around for so long.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.416
The thing is,
as technology continues to develop,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.835
we're gonna be talking to more
of these machines.

47:18.919 --> 47:20.671
And they're so annoying.

47:20.754 --> 47:24.258
I've seen both of you lose it
on both accounts, but the modern irony is:

47:24.341 --> 47:27.719
We humans created all this technology
that's making us miserable.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.388
We've done it to ourselves.

47:29.471 --> 47:31.181
[all laugh]
