WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:12.960
What can l say?
l just remembered, this isn't my night off.

00:13.132 --> 00:16.300
We'll have to cut
this lovely evening short.

00:16.470 --> 00:20.256
- l wish you'd told me sooner.
- l did, over dinner.

00:20.435 --> 00:23.888
You didn't hear me
over the oompah-pah band

00:24.065 --> 00:27.103
and the noise of you chewing bratwurst.

00:28.447 --> 00:31.449
l've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

00:31.618 --> 00:37.955
- RV show tickets aren't easy to get.
- Please, Eddie. l'm torn up enough.

00:39.505 --> 00:41.048
Coach...

00:41.216 --> 00:45.761
- You like RVs, mobile homes?
- l don't know much about them.

00:45.931 --> 00:48.767
- Like to learn?
- l was meaning to.

00:48.935 --> 00:52.887
Coach, meet Eddie. Eddie. Coach.

00:53.066 --> 00:57.066
He's got tickets to the RV show tonight.
How's that sound?

00:57.239 --> 00:59.280
- Terrific.
- l'll cover for you.

00:59.451 --> 01:01.076
Hot dog!

01:02.581 --> 01:05.155
Some luck!

01:05.334 --> 01:10.924
- l guess l won't get a good night kiss.
- You might if you're nice to him.

01:11.344 --> 01:15.640
l can't wait. Do they let you
walk through those things?

01:15.809 --> 01:19.559
- Yeah, if you take your shoes off.
- OK.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.274
Not now.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.351 --> 02:42.510
- Jerk.
- Yeah?

02:43.939 --> 02:49.778
For once it's not you. Mr Fancy Bottom
feels his martini isn't dry enough.

02:49.948 --> 02:54.447
Well, do you want me to kill him for you,
Diane?

02:54.622 --> 02:57.494
lt's too good for him.

02:58.503 --> 03:00.543
Come on, lighten up.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.420
This is a bar.
People come here to have a good time.

03:03.594 --> 03:08.139
- Yeah, don't you just hate them for it?
- What's wrong?

03:08.309 --> 03:11.727
l'm having a bad day.
Can l have a bad day?

03:11.898 --> 03:15.731
You've given us plenty.
Keep one for yourself.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.533
l hope it's to your satisfaction.

03:21.704 --> 03:26.249
We aspire to make every customer
a happy customer.

03:26.419 --> 03:28.662
lt's still not dry enough.

03:28.839 --> 03:30.798
Drink it!

03:30.968 --> 03:33.045
Say, excuse me, folks.

03:33.221 --> 03:37.386
She gets a little upset still,
ever since l dumped her.

03:38.228 --> 03:42.727
Let me do this. Coach!
The driest martini in town, on the house.

03:42.902 --> 03:45.608
- Right.
- Please, forgive her.

03:45.781 --> 03:51.324
She's a firebrand. l spend half my day
apologising to nice customers like you.

03:51.498 --> 03:57.124
- Carla, l'm in no mood.
- We're talking about someone else.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.793
One vodka rocks.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.719
- ls there anything l can do?
- No.

04:04.893 --> 04:08.477
This problem is between
myself and Frasier Crane.

04:08.649 --> 04:13.111
Suffice to say he insists on
making mountains out of molehills.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.440
He wants you to wear a padded bra?

04:19.289 --> 04:21.329
Go mate with a squid.

04:23.754 --> 04:26.128
Please forgive her again.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.338
She spent time in an institution recently.

04:32.142 --> 04:34.764
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Hey, Cliffie.

04:34.938 --> 04:37.227
Can you believe those Sox?

04:37.400 --> 04:43.523
l miss those carefree halcyon days
when my only concern was baseball.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.275
Cliffie, got something on your mind?

04:46.455 --> 04:52.128
l saw a fellow postal employee remove
a fragrance sample from a magazine.

04:53.215 --> 04:57.464
- So?
- lt's against employee regulations.

04:57.638 --> 05:02.267
lt's a smudge on every mail carrier
who ever donned this uniform.

05:02.437 --> 05:04.894
- So?
- So?

05:05.066 --> 05:07.106
On one hand, l don't want to be a snitch.

05:07.277 --> 05:10.196
But, on the other,
l can't endorse anarchy.

05:12.285 --> 05:16.367
- What should l do?
- Compromise, have a beer.

05:16.541 --> 05:19.828
l see l should look elsewhere
for help on this.

05:20.004 --> 05:24.716
- Diane, l've got a little problem here.
- Who doesn't?

05:24.887 --> 05:27.593
Valid, valid.

05:27.766 --> 05:29.973
Well, l guess my choice is clear.

05:30.145 --> 05:33.562
l must follow my conscience
and report this.

05:33.733 --> 05:37.649
Come on, man. lt's a fragrance sample.
Let it go.

05:37.823 --> 05:43.068
Let it go? l let this go and tomorrow
Hitler is in the White House.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.086
l can do without that.

05:48.255 --> 05:51.922
Sure, it's only a perfume sample,

05:52.094 --> 05:56.259
but if he gets away with it,
the others will start taking things, too.

05:56.434 --> 06:00.385
First, whole magazines go missing.
Then social security cheques.

06:00.565 --> 06:07.484
Before long, Grandma's fruitcake doesn't
make it to little Bobby, Peggy and Sue.

06:07.659 --> 06:12.738
Their little hearts will break,
thinking Grandma forgot them this year.

06:12.916 --> 06:17.165
What are those little green things
in a fruitcake, Cliff?

06:17.340 --> 06:20.924
They look like parts of tyres.

06:21.763 --> 06:26.973
- You're getting a little off the point.
- You brought it up, Cliffie.

06:27.146 --> 06:29.472
Who is this menace to society?

06:29.650 --> 06:32.771
Do you remember Lewis,
that fella l brought in here?

06:32.946 --> 06:35.783
- Enormous black gentleman?
- That's the one.

06:35.951 --> 06:37.410
Cliff!

06:37.578 --> 06:41.909
Come on, l'd think twice before
crossing Lewis. lt could be dangerous.

06:42.085 --> 06:45.538
He's not the kind of guy who drinks tea
with his pinkie sticking out.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.967
Please, Sam, there are ladies present.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.759
- l'm sorry, Coach.
- Thank you.

06:57.816 --> 07:01.863
l guess the bottom line
is that it'd be snitching.

07:02.031 --> 07:05.449
- l like to think l'm a little above that.
- Absolutely.

07:09.542 --> 07:13.672
What's that? You announcing
the birth of yet another child?

07:15.384 --> 07:21.141
- Or are you implying something?
- You'd rat on a little guy.

07:23.980 --> 07:28.977
- Yeah? l'm going to rat on this guy, too.
- Don't let Carla goad you into this.

07:29.155 --> 07:33.201
Sammy, as long as l wear this uniform,
l have a duty to fulfil.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.537
l'll speak my truth
and take the consequences.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.831
- Supervisor, please.
- Come on, Cliff.

07:39.003 --> 07:46.005
l don't care about the risk. The voice
of Clifford Clavin is going to be heard.

07:46.180 --> 07:50.928
Hello, hang on to your yockstrap.
l have a terrible thing to report.

07:57.780 --> 08:00.237
- Good night.
- Night, Cliffie.

08:00.409 --> 08:04.990
Cliff. You want to spend
the night in my office?

08:06.377 --> 08:11.290
- You still think l'm afraid, don't you?
- Yumpin' yimminy, no.

08:12.636 --> 08:17.051
That Swedish accent
was just for the amusement of the bar.

08:17.226 --> 08:19.552
l don't care if Lewis finds out it was me.

08:19.730 --> 08:24.774
ln fact, if l ever see the guy again,
l'll tell him it was me and clear the air.

08:28.910 --> 08:31.367
You're the man l'm looking for.

08:32.499 --> 08:38.374
- l've been fired!
- l'm sorry! God, l'm terribly sorry.

08:38.549 --> 08:43.178
You're taking this worse than l am.
l just want to find out who did it.

08:44.517 --> 08:47.852
- Did what?
- Someone called the supervisor

08:48.022 --> 08:52.769
and squealed on me for taking
a perfume sample out of a magazine.

08:52.946 --> 08:55.319
He fired you for that?

08:55.491 --> 08:59.242
What kind of a chicken outfit
do we work for?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.496
You smell divine.
What are you wearing?

09:03.670 --> 09:06.458
Giorgio for Men.

09:08.260 --> 09:11.049
Who could blame you?
lt's perfect for you.

09:11.223 --> 09:14.059
- Sorry l can't help you out.
- You can.

09:14.227 --> 09:18.013
Know how you stick your nose
in people's business at the post office?

09:18.192 --> 09:20.185
You're nosy!

09:20.361 --> 09:24.147
- l want to know who did it by tomorrow.
- OK, pal.

09:24.326 --> 09:27.032
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late.

09:27.205 --> 09:31.834
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late
cos l'll have that information.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.626
l know you will.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.255
Lewis?

09:36.427 --> 09:38.919
Thanks for thinking of me.

09:41.560 --> 09:46.390
- Tomorrow l die.
- Come on, now.

09:46.567 --> 09:50.353
The guy is going to beat
the living hell out of me.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.608
No use saying l don't deserve it.

09:52.785 --> 09:55.455
- Nobody did.
- Thanks, Carla.

09:55.622 --> 09:58.411
- Coach, let's go home.
- Yeah.

09:58.585 --> 10:02.419
Can l play my French language tapes
on the way home?

10:02.591 --> 10:05.213
No. We hear them every night.
l'm sick of it.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.472
- They're not doing any good.
- They are.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.600
Say ''How are you today?''
in French.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.642
How are you today?
ln French.

10:13.816 --> 10:16.355
- l rest my case.
- l rest my case.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.447
- Knock it off.
- Knock it off.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.956
- Frasier.
- Hi, Sam.

10:30.132 --> 10:32.920
Diane left about 1 5 minutes ago.

10:33.094 --> 10:36.346
Darn. Guess l'll go to her house
to shoot the breeze.

10:36.516 --> 10:39.187
Diane is more like a monsoon.

10:40.814 --> 10:44.517
Yes, her breeze is like a monsoon.

10:44.695 --> 10:46.902
Good night.

10:52.415 --> 10:56.284
- Want to come in and have a beer?
- l wouldn't want to impose.

10:56.462 --> 10:58.586
OK, good night.

11:01.178 --> 11:03.218
This is fun.

11:04.099 --> 11:08.181
l've got time for bar room chatter.
Might do the old boy good.

11:08.355 --> 11:09.980
Maybe.

11:10.149 --> 11:14.612
Well, l'll have a tankard
of your finest lager.

11:19.455 --> 11:23.537
l understand the local Boston Red Sox
baseball franchise

11:23.711 --> 11:26.998
has a Herculean task to qualify
for the post-season tournament.

11:27.175 --> 11:29.382
Yeah, they really stink this year.

11:29.595 --> 11:32.763
Stink? lnteresting theory.

11:35.103 --> 11:39.732
While we're on the subject of Boston
and the world and all of its people,

11:39.902 --> 11:42.738
l have this patient. Let's call him...

11:42.906 --> 11:45.363
Give him any old name. Thor.

11:47.580 --> 11:51.627
For the first time in my career,
l can't solve this problem.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.287
But it occurs to me that you might.

11:54.465 --> 11:57.551
You want my opinion
on one of your patients?

11:57.720 --> 12:02.468
Believe it or not, psychiatrists
value input from outside the profession.

12:02.644 --> 12:05.849
l'd like the benefit of your experience.
You know women.

12:06.024 --> 12:08.730
l mean, your sexual exploits

12:08.903 --> 12:14.411
could be thought of
as a majestic panoramic mural.

12:14.578 --> 12:18.578
- And Thor's...?
- A silly little doodle.

12:19.961 --> 12:22.454
All right. What the hell?

12:23.550 --> 12:26.125
What's his problem?

12:27.264 --> 12:30.635
Thor's girlfriend, let's call her...

12:30.811 --> 12:33.434
Electra...

12:38.656 --> 12:42.608
cried out another man's name
during the act of love.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.119
- Oh, Thor. Ouch.
- Precisely.

12:47.294 --> 12:51.210
So, Sam, tell me.
You've been with a lot of women.

12:51.383 --> 12:53.709
When you were with one of them,

12:53.887 --> 12:56.426
did she ever call out
another man's name?

12:56.599 --> 13:00.136
l don't think so, but then who listens?

13:04.903 --> 13:08.772
Usually l've got the stereo turned up
and other things on my mind.

13:11.162 --> 13:16.622
Tell me, whose name
did Electra call out?

13:16.796 --> 13:21.709
- An old boyfriend's.
- Double ouch.

13:21.887 --> 13:25.673
Although they've decided it
means nothing, which it doesn't,

13:25.851 --> 13:29.103
Thor doesn't seem
to be able to get over it.

13:29.273 --> 13:34.067
So if Thor came to you,
what would you tell him?

13:35.615 --> 13:38.238
The truth, that it happens all the time.

13:38.411 --> 13:41.117
- Really?
- lt happens to all guys.

13:41.291 --> 13:45.753
ln fact, l just remembered
it's happened to me before, lots of times.

13:45.922 --> 13:48.960
l turned the stereo up because of that.

13:49.136 --> 13:50.963
Really?

13:52.140 --> 13:55.974
Well, thank you, Sam.
l'll pass that along to...

13:56.146 --> 14:00.312
- Thor.
- Right. lt's getting late.

14:00.486 --> 14:02.895
Thanks for the cold one, Sam.

14:03.073 --> 14:05.696
The beer, l mean, not Diane.

14:09.290 --> 14:12.792
Two sips of liquor
and l'm a jack-a-ninny.

14:32.575 --> 14:36.444
- Lewis will be here any minute.
- What's your plan?

14:36.623 --> 14:39.032
Plan? l have no plan.

14:39.210 --> 14:42.746
Unless honesty and
straightforwardness are a plan.

14:42.924 --> 14:46.211
No, l meant your medical plan.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.886
Your humour's falling on deaf ears.

14:50.059 --> 14:54.688
Good, you won't miss them
when Lewis rips them off your head.

14:56.319 --> 14:57.730
Sam.

14:58.113 --> 14:59.524
Sam?

15:00.825 --> 15:02.570
Barkeep.

15:02.745 --> 15:06.958
l'm sorry, Diane. Do you want me?

15:09.964 --> 15:12.836
Actually, l want two Becks.

15:13.010 --> 15:16.463
Guess l didn't hear you
calling out my name.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.473
ls something amusing you
that l don't know about?

15:22.649 --> 15:25.224
No, why do you ask?

15:25.403 --> 15:28.821
That stupid look on your face.

15:28.992 --> 15:32.279
Do l need a reason to look stupid?

15:34.292 --> 15:36.748
You have the best reason of all.

15:38.548 --> 15:41.005
OK, Clavin, you know why l'm here.

15:42.095 --> 15:45.014
- Who is it?
- Lewis...

15:45.183 --> 15:48.885
l've written a man's name
on a piece of paper in this envelope.

15:49.064 --> 15:51.472
- Good.
- Before you look at it,

15:51.651 --> 15:53.395
let me tell you something about him.

15:53.570 --> 15:56.063
ls this ''The Dating Game''?

15:56.241 --> 15:58.650
The man whose name is in this envelope

15:58.828 --> 16:02.365
bears no animosity towards you
or any living thing.

16:02.542 --> 16:05.034
He's a man who loves his country.

16:05.213 --> 16:10.422
He did it out of a sense of duty towards
America, God and all that we cherish.

16:11.931 --> 16:17.557
One other thing. The man who did this
is terribly sorry. Please forgive him.

16:26.995 --> 16:31.077
OK. l've got another job anyway.

16:31.251 --> 16:35.797
lf l saw that name, l'd get so angry
l might do something stupid.

16:35.967 --> 16:38.007
Go on. Open it.

16:39.388 --> 16:41.631
l can't tell you how proud l am

16:41.809 --> 16:44.894
to see you overcome
your need for vengeance.

16:48.652 --> 16:53.115
Tell that fellow he's real lucky
he's still in one piece.

16:53.284 --> 16:55.955
He knows it, Lewis.

16:57.081 --> 16:59.656
You'd better.

17:08.056 --> 17:11.058
You really showed me something there.

17:11.227 --> 17:16.355
That was more than just stupidity.
There was a trace of bravery in there.

17:17.028 --> 17:19.698
- Way to go, Cliff.
- Thanks.

17:19.865 --> 17:23.282
All right, who's Juan Torrez?

17:25.832 --> 17:31.422
- There must be some mistake.
- No. There's a map to his house.

17:31.591 --> 17:35.044
l knew he wasn't
going to look in that thing.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.221
Besides, he knows it was me.
So what's the big deal?

17:42.691 --> 17:47.854
He'd never hit Juan. He's in a body cast.
He fell out of a window.

17:52.121 --> 17:54.495
- What?
- What what?

17:55.960 --> 18:00.043
Don't be coy. lt doesn't go
with the sloping forehead.

18:00.217 --> 18:03.172
Did l tell you
your boyfriend stopped by?

18:03.346 --> 18:06.349
- What's his name?
- You know very well it's Frasier.

18:06.518 --> 18:10.019
Frasier, right!
That's an easy name to forget.

18:12.777 --> 18:15.732
- How are you two doing?
- Fine.

18:15.907 --> 18:19.075
- ls there something on your mind?
- No, why do you ask?

18:20.121 --> 18:25.367
lf there's a spot on an empty canvas,
it tends to stand out.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.091
No, if l had something to say, l'd say it.

18:31.221 --> 18:33.511
l'd even yell it out.

18:33.683 --> 18:35.724
Passionately.

18:40.694 --> 18:43.649
What did you and Frasier talk about?

18:43.823 --> 18:47.408
Let's drop this whole thing.
lt's going nowhere.

18:47.579 --> 18:50.534
We both have more important work
to get back to.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.497
l know l'm running a little behind.

18:55.465 --> 18:58.634
You're smug.
You think you have something on me.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.972
- l emphasise 'think'.
- l'm not thinking.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.180
No, but this is as close as you get.

19:06.941 --> 19:09.896
Come on. Why don't you
stop this silly little game

19:10.070 --> 19:13.571
and admit you're still crazy about me?

19:13.743 --> 19:16.282
You're the one who always brings it up.

19:16.455 --> 19:20.870
lf anybody's crazy about anybody,
you're crazy about me.

19:21.045 --> 19:25.709
l'm not saying ''Sam''
when l'm in bed with Frasier.

19:43.120 --> 19:47.071
l'll kill him! l'll kill you!

19:47.251 --> 19:50.289
- Then l'll kill myself.
- You're overreacting.

19:50.464 --> 19:52.956
There's no need to kill me.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.216
- Hello.
- Hello, your buttocks! Get in here!

19:59.394 --> 20:03.559
- You seem agitated.
- l don't know who l hate the most.

20:03.733 --> 20:06.855
That's not bad.
Only two months and you're tied with me.

20:08.616 --> 20:13.861
- How could you tell him?
- l didn't. He must have deduced it.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.449
Oh, please.

20:18.422 --> 20:21.590
Come on, l'm good at deducement.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.712
- How could you betray my confidence?
- You didn't say no telling.

20:25.891 --> 20:30.472
l see. Obviously l made the mistake
of treating you as an adult.

20:30.648 --> 20:34.897
- Why tell him anything to begin with?
- l was hoping for some insight.

20:35.781 --> 20:37.406
lnsight!

20:37.575 --> 20:40.697
From a man whose idea
of intellectual stimulation

20:40.872 --> 20:43.198
is to count along with Big Bird?

20:48.842 --> 20:53.672
ln his arrogance, he thought that when
l called out ''Sam'', l was referring to him.

20:53.850 --> 20:57.434
- And you weren't?
- No!

20:57.605 --> 21:00.276
lt was a different Sam entirely.

21:00.443 --> 21:03.149
lt was...Sam Goldwyn.

21:04.657 --> 21:07.944
His movies always
gave me great pleasure.

21:10.207 --> 21:14.788
Diane, Sam, please.
Let's not go on this way.

21:14.964 --> 21:18.715
Now it's out in the open,
let's face it and admit the truth.

21:18.887 --> 21:22.838
- What are you talking about?
- There's still a spark between you two.

21:23.018 --> 21:29.190
lt's best that l step aside and allow it
to either ignite or extinguish itself.

21:29.361 --> 21:32.696
Frasier, look into my eyes.

21:32.866 --> 21:35.405
You are the man in my life.

21:35.578 --> 21:38.913
There is no longer anything
between Sam and l.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.836
You'll see the same thing in his eyes.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.677
Can't l just tell him?

21:55.608 --> 21:57.815
Do it, Sam.

22:01.909 --> 22:05.909
There's nothing going on between us.
lt's all over between me and Diane.

22:08.335 --> 22:13.296
- l believe you.
- Frasier, thank God!

22:13.468 --> 22:16.423
- How could you have doubted me?
- l don't know.

22:16.597 --> 22:19.719
l really haven't been myself
these last few days.

22:19.894 --> 22:24.225
What do you say we take a weekend off
and go someplace together?

22:24.401 --> 22:26.441
Yes, let's.

22:26.612 --> 22:30.315
l'd better go.
l'm late for my marital relations group.

22:30.493 --> 22:34.789
And, thanks. l'd like to apologise
to you both for flying off the handle.

22:34.958 --> 22:39.788
lt just shows that
even psychiatrists get the blues.

22:39.965 --> 22:42.173
Diane, see you later.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.254
- Sam.
- Yeah?

22:44.430 --> 22:47.516
- Go Red Sox.
- Ra!

22:51.733 --> 22:53.810
What actors we are, Sam.

22:55.155 --> 22:59.735
- l'm amazed we could pull that off.
- Pull what off?

22:59.912 --> 23:04.659
Fooling a man so versed
in human behaviour.

23:07.006 --> 23:09.083
There is a spark, isn't there, Sam?

23:11.888 --> 23:13.347
Well...

23:14.100 --> 23:15.263
Gee...

23:16.728 --> 23:19.647
l don't think it would take
much encouragement

23:19.816 --> 23:23.650
to turn it into an inferno.

23:26.409 --> 23:29.116
Maybe you're right.

23:29.289 --> 23:33.917
Sam, let's stop stopping ourselves.
Let's let it happen.

23:34.088 --> 23:37.209
Happen. Happen, yeah.

23:42.809 --> 23:46.226
- Oh, Diane...
- Frasier!

23:57.205 --> 23:58.831
Oh, yeah?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.625
Well, ha ha!
