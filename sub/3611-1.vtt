00:02.253 --> 00:03.663
Previously on Lost:

00:04.839 --> 00:09.082
Ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

00:12.221 --> 00:16.305
| just killed a man who has been
outside this facility for the last week.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.633
I want you to come with me.
Somewhere safe.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.639
You and l have common interests.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.187
We're not the only ones
who left the island.

00:23.274 --> 00:26.766
We were not supposed to leave.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.443
- Goodbye, Jack.
- We have to go back, Kate.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.193
Hello, Jack. Did he tell you
that l was off the island?

00:33.284 --> 00:36.151
Yes, he did. He said that
I had to come back.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.985
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.465
Baby's awake.

01:01.646 --> 01:03.227
It's your turn.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.744
- Morning. Here you go, Doc.
- I don't need a script.

02:07.712 --> 02:09.623
Let's go. I don't have all day.

02:10.715 --> 02:11.795
Speed.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.875
OK. Dharma orientation film
number two, take one.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.636
And action.

02:23.602 --> 02:26.139
Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle

02:26.230 --> 02:30.473
and this is the orientation film
for station two, the Arrow.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.184
Given your specific area of expertise,

02:33.279 --> 02:37.113
you should find it no surprise
that this station's primary purpose

02:37.199 --> 02:39.611
is to develop defensive strategies

02:39.702 --> 02:43.536
and gather intelligence on the island's
hostile indigenous popul...

02:43.622 --> 02:45.749
Dr. Chang! Dr. Chang?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.243
- What the hell!
- Cut!

02:47.335 --> 02:49.200
Sir. We got a problem at the Orchid.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.149
Over here.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.852
We were cutting through the rock,
on your specs,

03:16.947 --> 03:19.279
that's when the drill melted.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.982
- The drill melted?
- Yeah.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.988
Three meters from the margin line
on the plans.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.786
Went through six carbon drill bits,
last one fried.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.580
My operator starts
grabbing his head, freaking out.

03:34.131 --> 03:38.465
We sonar-imaged the wall. There's
an open chamber about 20 meters in

03:38.552 --> 03:39.928
behind the rock.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.003
There's something in there.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.260
The only way to get to it
is to lay charges here and here

03:48.354 --> 03:51.721
- and blast through and take a look...
- Under no circumstances.

03:51.816 --> 03:55.479
This station is being built here
because of its proximity

03:55.569 --> 03:57.730
to what we believe
is a limitless energy.

03:57.822 --> 04:01.986
And that energy,
once we can harness it correctly,

04:02.076 --> 04:05.159
it's going to allow us
to manipulate time.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.531
Right.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.740
OK. So, what, we're gonna
go back and kill Hitler?

04:10.835 --> 04:14.248
Don't be absurd. There are rules.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.203
Rules that can't be broken.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.503
So what do you want me to do?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.425
You're gonna do nothing.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.471
If you drill
even one centimeter further,

04:25.558 --> 04:28.265
you risk releasing that energy.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.853
If that were to happen...

04:32.982 --> 04:34.597
...God help us all.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.187
Get him up. Let's go.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.192
- Watch yourself.
- Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.

04:48.706 --> 04:52.198
Come on. I'll grab the rest
of his stuff. Let's go.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.713
Did you hear that?

05:00.801 --> 05:04.385
Time travel. How stupid
does that guy think we are?

05:55.564 --> 05:58.146
Why don't you close that up now, Jack?

05:58.234 --> 06:00.725
Come on, let's get him in the van.
It's out back.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.363
Where are we taking him?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.859
We'll worry about that
once we pick up Hugo.

06:07.576 --> 06:12.195
Hurley is locked away
in a mental institution.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.532
Which should make recruiting him
easier than the rest of your friends.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.288
They're not my friends anymore.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.878
That's the spirit.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.292
How did we get here?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.429
How did all this happen?

06:33.852 --> 06:35.808
It happened because you left, Jack.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.481
Now let's get started, shall we?

06:54.290 --> 06:56.576
So once we get Hurley, then what?

06:56.667 --> 06:58.874
Then we get Sun, Sayid...

07:00.796 --> 07:02.161
...and Kate, of course.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.918
I don't see that happening.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.760
When was the last time you saw him?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.603
I mean Locke.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.393
On the island.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.609
In the Orchid station,
below the greenhouse.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.656
I told him I was sorry
for making his life so miserable.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.575
And then he left.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.125
Obviously John's visit to you
made an impression.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.373
What'd he say to make you
such a believer?

07:49.511 --> 07:52.127
Sawyer, Juliet,

07:52.222 --> 07:54.133
everyone from the boat,

07:54.224 --> 07:57.933
everyone we left behind,
John said that they'd die, too...

07:59.271 --> 08:01.307
...ifl didn't come back.

08:03.192 --> 08:06.559
Did he tell you what happened to them
after the island moved?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.986
No.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.109
No, he didn't.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.239
Then I guess we'll never know.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.514
What the...

09:21.395 --> 09:22.805
Richard?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.346
Richard!

09:27.776 --> 09:29.312
Anyone?!

09:33.824 --> 09:35.189
Anyone!

09:39.788 --> 09:41.744
What happened?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.661
What was that light?

09:47.129 --> 09:50.371
We must've been inside the radius.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.842
What the hell was that?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.798
I don't know.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.563
Where's the freighter?

10:12.863 --> 10:15.821
- Maybe it went down.
- No way.

10:15.908 --> 10:19.821
A minute ago that boat was coughing
black smoke. Now there's nothing?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.528
What about the helicopter?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.790
It was heading for that boat.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.373
Rose?!

10:30.464 --> 10:32.045
Rose!

10:33.842 --> 10:35.298
- Bernard!
- Rose!

10:36.804 --> 10:39.295
- Have you seen Rose?
- No.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.131
Oh, my God!

10:42.226 --> 10:43.762
- Bernard!
- Rose!

10:43.852 --> 10:46.889
- Where were you?
- l was over by the church.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.596
- What was that sound, that light?
- I don't know.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.431
Just calm down, no need to panic.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.769
- We'll go back to camp...
- "Calm down? No need to panic?"

10:54.863 --> 10:56.319
We can't go back to the camp!

10:57.074 --> 10:59.986
- What the hell are you talking about?
- There is no camp.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.081
The sky lit up, and then this.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.002
The kitchen... gone.

11:13.757 --> 11:17.500
And all the tents,
all the food and water, gone.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.336
Everything but us. All of it.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.806
It's gone.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.630
It's not gone.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.182
- Daniel.
- Hey.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.015
- I thought you were on the freighter.
- We never made it.

11:33.110 --> 11:37.023
- We were on our way when it happened.
- What do you mean the camp's not gone?

11:37.614 --> 11:40.651
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- That's Dan.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.030
- He's our physicist.
- Listen, we have no time.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.612
Take me to something man-made,
that was built.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.197
Any kind of landmark.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.784
There's a Dharma station
15 minutes from here.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.461
You mean the hatch?
The one we blew up?

11:54.548 --> 11:57.756
Perfect. We should get moving
before it happens again.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.797
Before what happens again?

12:02.639 --> 12:04.891
And why is our camp gone?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.556
Your camp isn't gone.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.310
It hasn't been built yet.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.369
TunneH

12:32.085 --> 12:34.337
I think choo-choo
knows better than that.

12:35.756 --> 12:39.169
If he goes into that tunnel,
he's never coming back out.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.300
Watch your cartoons, Goober.
Mommy'll be right back.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.763
- Miss Austen?
- Yes?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.894
l'm Dan Norton of the law firm
Agostini & Norton.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.318
- May we have a moment of your time?
- And who are you?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.906
He's my associate.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.197
lfl could just come in, I'll explain...

13:04.284 --> 13:07.242
- No, you can explain right here.
- OK. You got it.

13:08.705 --> 13:14.041
We're here to get a blood sample
from you and one from your son, Aaron.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.207
- Excuse me?
- Now, l have a court order,

13:18.298 --> 13:21.756
signed by a judge, to relinquish
your blood upon being served...

13:21.843 --> 13:23.458
Why?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.044
To determine
your relationship to the child.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.307
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Who is he...?

13:30.394 --> 13:33.477
I'm not at liberty to divulge
the identity of my client.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.519
- Your client?
- Please. May we come in?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.722
Get off my property.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.360
If you won't comply, then I'm going
to have to come back with the sheriff.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.699
Then come back with the sheriff.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.560
Where are you going, Mommy?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.356
We're going on vacation, baby.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.792
Say bye-bye, baby.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.472
Why did you jump off that helicopter?

14:56.271 --> 14:59.855
I told you. We were running outta gas
and I wanted to make sure she...

15:00.692 --> 15:03.274
I wanted to make sure
they got back to the boat.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.815
It don't matter now, does it?

15:05.906 --> 15:09.398
I really need the two of you
to pick up the pace, OK? Thanks.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.199
First thing's first.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.660
Give me your shirt.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.163
- My shirt?
- Yeah.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.911
I really think we have
far more pressing matters

15:22.005 --> 15:25.668
than me giving you a shirt.
Why don't we just keep moving, OK?

15:25.759 --> 15:28.171
How about we call a timeout,
tell us what's going on.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.468
- Trust me.
- Trust you? I don't know you!

15:30.555 --> 15:33.638
We really do not have time
for me to try to explain.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.102
You have no idea
how difficult that would be,

15:36.186 --> 15:39.223
for me to try to explain
this phenomenon

15:39.314 --> 15:42.101
to a quantum physicist.
That would be difficult.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.228
For me to explain what's happened...

15:46.321 --> 15:49.563
- What the hell are you do...?
- Shut it, or you're getting one.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.284
Now talk.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.120
The island...

15:59.376 --> 16:02.868
Think of the island like a record,
spinning on a turntable.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.046
Only now, that record is skipping.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.588
Whatever Ben Linus did
down at the Orchid station...

16:12.139 --> 16:14.175
...I think it may have...

16:15.225 --> 16:16.715
...dislodged us.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.301
Dislodged us from what?

16:20.355 --> 16:22.186
Time.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.184
So that's why our camp is gone?

16:27.279 --> 16:29.565
Because the island
is moving through time?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.147
Either the island is or we are.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.948
What?

16:34.035 --> 16:36.822
It's likely that we're moving,
your people and us.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.832
Everyone in your group,
you're all accounted for, right?

16:47.632 --> 16:48.747
Not everyone.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.091
Locke.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.429
Is anyone there?!

18:32.362 --> 18:34.694
Hello?!

18:38.201 --> 18:39.236
Hello?!

19:09.733 --> 19:10.722
Hey!

19:33.089 --> 19:34.920
Who are you?

19:38.762 --> 19:38.796
Wha... Listen. Listen!

19:38.803 --> 19:40.304
Wha... Listen. Listen!

19:40.388 --> 19:43.095
- How many others on board?
- You don't understand.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.174
I didn't come on that plane...

19:45.268 --> 19:47.259
- Wrong answer.
- No, wait! Stop!

19:48.355 --> 19:50.846
I know you! I know who you are.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.432
Your name... Your name is Ethan.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.602
Your name is Ethan.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.565
- Who are you?
- My name is John Locke.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.493
I know this is going to be
hard to understand but...

20:06.289 --> 20:09.656
...Ben Linus appointed me
as your leader.

20:11.669 --> 20:15.503
That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.750
Goodbye, John Locke.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.658
Great.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.416
So when are we now, whiz kid?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.665
We're either in the past...

20:59.300 --> 21:01.086
...or we're in the future.

21:02.679 --> 21:07.264
Flight 23 for Paris
will begin boarding at gate 15.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.887
Please have your boarding passes ready.

21:20.572 --> 21:23.234
Evening, ma'am.
Where are you flying to tonight?

21:23.324 --> 21:25.280
- Los Angeles.
- Of course.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.279
May | see your passport, please?

21:36.588 --> 21:40.957
Excuse me, could you wait here
forjust one moment, Ms. Kwon?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.022
Hey! Where are you go...?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.896
Open this door!

21:57.984 --> 22:00.350
- Open this door!
- Save your breath.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.902
They only do what I tell them to do.

22:05.783 --> 22:06.943
You.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.114
You had me brought in here?

22:11.748 --> 22:12.783
Why?

22:12.874 --> 22:17.413
You had the audacity
to approach me in broad daylight,

22:17.504 --> 22:20.871
in front of my business associates,
in public.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.502
Why did I have you brought here?

22:23.593 --> 22:25.925
Because you showed me no respect.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.716
I will be respected, Sun.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.218
Fair enough.

22:35.855 --> 22:40.019
Since you seem to be worried about your
plane, I'll get right down to business.

22:40.985 --> 22:45.103
You mentioned that you and I
had common interests.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.868
Why don't you tell me
exactly what they might be.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.456
To kill Benjamin Linus.

23:03.132 --> 23:07.546
The victim was found shot in his car on
the grounds of the Santa Rosa Hospital,

23:07.637 --> 23:09.593
a private mental health facility.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.717
OK. Let's go get him.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.424
Police identified their suspect
in the shooting

23:14.519 --> 23:17.386
as a patient who escaped
earlier this evening,

23:17.480 --> 23:18.720
Hugo Reyes.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.431
Now, if that name
sounds familiar to you,

23:21.526 --> 23:25.895
that's because Reyes was a member
of the infamous Oceanic Six.

23:25.989 --> 23:30.278
As to why he may have murdered
a visitor to the facility,

23:30.368 --> 23:32.484
that remains a complete mystery.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.868
Well.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.490
Looks like we have a change of plan.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.130
Here she comes. Right now.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.848
Here's your order, sir.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.848
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.058
Awesome. Want a fry?

24:02.567 --> 24:03.977
No, thank you.

24:04.068 --> 24:07.936
If you ate more comfort food,
you wouldn't go around shooting people.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.372
That dude you popped outside
Santa Rosa, who was he?

24:26.466 --> 24:29.833
I don't care. He was armed
and he was watching you.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.963
That made him an enemy.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.761
You think he was gonna kill me?

24:33.848 --> 24:36.430
I'm not taking any risks
after Bentham died.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.553
- You mean Locke.
- Yes, I mean Locke.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.974
I need a cool code name.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.227
So when'd you become so paranoid?

24:49.322 --> 24:52.780
If you'd spent the last two years
doing the things I was doing,

24:52.867 --> 24:54.858
you'd be paranoid, too.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.490
Oh, yeah? Like what?

24:58.581 --> 25:00.242
What kind of things?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.579
l was working for Benjamin Linus.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.210
Wait... he's on our side now?

25:07.298 --> 25:09.129
Listen to me, Hurley.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.177
If you ever have the misfortune
of running into him,

25:14.263 --> 25:16.345
whatever he tells you,

25:16.432 --> 25:17.888
just do the opposite.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.274
Wait here!

26:26.836 --> 26:28.201
Check him out.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.875
Look out! That guy's got a gun!

26:31.966 --> 26:34.082
Run! Get out of here!
Call the cops!

26:34.177 --> 26:35.417
Hurry!

26:43.394 --> 26:44.895
Sayid!

26:47.106 --> 26:49.848
- Are you OK?
- Get me to the car.

26:53.362 --> 26:57.275
Oh, man. I thought this was
supposed to be a safe house.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.277
I never should've left that island.

27:19.013 --> 27:21.755
- Do you think he's looking for us?
- Who?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.965
Widmore.

27:24.060 --> 27:27.894
It took him, like, 20 years
to find this place the first time.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.766
I'll start holding my breath now.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.393
Over here.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.112
- Is this the hatch?
- It was.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.744
Blown up, just like we left it.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.330
OK.

27:52.421 --> 27:57.085
So when we are now, it's now after you
and your people crashed on the island.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.926
You saying our camp
is back on the beach again?

28:01.013 --> 28:02.264
It's possible. Yeah.

28:02.348 --> 28:06.842
- Good. I'm going back.
- No, no. It's pointless.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.427
More pointless than staring
at a hole in the ground?

28:09.522 --> 28:13.140
We don't know when the next flash is
coming. Your camp could be gone again.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.895
Yeah, but what if it ain't?

28:14.986 --> 28:17.978
Hell, what if the helicopter
hasn't even taken off yet?

28:18.072 --> 28:21.235
We could warn them. Stop them
from ever flying to that boat.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.027
- That's not the way it works.
- Who says?

28:26.122 --> 28:29.410
You cannot change anything. You can't.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.536
Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.492
Why not?

28:33.588 --> 28:36.045
Time, it's like a street.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.714
We can move forward,
we can move in reverse,

28:38.801 --> 28:42.134
but we cannot ever create a new street.

28:42.221 --> 28:46.806
If we try to do anything different,
we will fail. Every time.

28:46.893 --> 28:50.010
Whatever happened, happened.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.807
How do you know so much
about this, Danny Boy?

29:01.115 --> 29:03.902
I know this because

29:03.993 --> 29:08.362
I've spent my entire adult life
studying space-time.

29:08.456 --> 29:12.040
I know this because this journal
contains everything I've learned

29:12.126 --> 29:16.711
about the Dharma lnitiative.
This is why I'm here.

29:18.007 --> 29:20.464
I know what's happening.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.837
So how can we stop it?

29:24.138 --> 29:25.469
We can't stop it.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.593
Then who can?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.003
Richard?

31:28.304 --> 31:29.339
Hey, John.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.848
Richard, what is happening?

31:37.938 --> 31:40.429
What's happening is
you're bleeding to death.

31:42.318 --> 31:43.649
Here...

31:47.323 --> 31:48.984
I need to get the bullet out.

31:52.703 --> 31:55.570
How did you know there was
a bullet in my leg, Richard?

31:55.664 --> 31:59.373
- Because you told me there was.
- No, I didn't.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.872
Well... you will.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.331
It was Ethan who shot me.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.462
Well, what comes around, goes around.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.176
When am |?

32:15.935 --> 32:18.176
Well, John. That's all relative.

32:21.690 --> 32:25.899
Wait. The noise.
When the sky lit up? Where did you go?

32:25.986 --> 32:28.318
I didn't go anywhere. You went.

32:28.405 --> 32:32.694
This is gonna hurt. It'll be
a lot worse if you move. Hold still.

32:43.212 --> 32:44.372
All done.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.712
I don't understand.
How did you know that l was here?

32:53.806 --> 32:55.637
How did you know where to find me?

32:55.724 --> 32:59.308
| wish I had time to explain it, but
you're going to be moving on soon.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.228
- We need to go over a couple of things.
- "Moving on"?

33:02.314 --> 33:05.977
Sorry. First thing, you're going
to need to clean out the wound

33:06.068 --> 33:09.401
every couple hours and keep as
much weight off the leg as you can.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.979
- The island will do the rest.
- Wait. I don't...

33:12.074 --> 33:16.568
Pay attention. Next time we see each
other, I'm not gonna recognize you.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.573
You give me this.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.366
All right?

33:20.457 --> 33:22.994
- What is it?
- It's a compass.

33:23.085 --> 33:26.953
- What does it do?
- It points north, John.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.880
| wish I had time to be
more sensitive about this

33:29.967 --> 33:32.800
because it's a lot to swallow,
but you need to know it

33:32.887 --> 33:35.924
in order to do what you got to do.
l'mjust gonna say it, OK?

33:36.015 --> 33:39.724
The only way to save the island
is to get your people back here.

33:39.810 --> 33:43.428
- The ones who left.
- Jack? Kate?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.355
- The chopper was headed for the boat.
- They're fine.

33:46.442 --> 33:49.684
They're already home. You have
to convince them to come back.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.939
How am I supposed to do that?

33:53.949 --> 33:55.655
You're gonna have to die, John.

35:01.558 --> 35:05.767
So what was this thing
before you guys blew it up?

35:05.854 --> 35:08.436
- A Dharma station.
- For what?

35:08.524 --> 35:11.482
There was a man named Desmond
living down in it.

35:11.568 --> 35:15.982
He was pushing a button
every 108 minutes to save the world.

35:16.073 --> 35:19.031
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.206
Son of a...

35:33.215 --> 35:34.546
...bitch.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.561
The hatch, it's back.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.782
I guess you haven't found it yet.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.207
Hey, where are you going?

36:14.298 --> 36:17.586
Back door. I'm getting some supplies.

36:21.138 --> 36:23.424
James, wait. Not a good idea.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.007
The sky can flash all it wants,
but I ain't starting over, Dilbert.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.014
I ain't rubbing two sticks
to make a fire or hunting boar.

36:30.105 --> 36:34.599
There's Dharma food, beer
and clothing in there.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.649
I'm getting Desmond to let me in.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.648
- That's not gonna work.
- Why not?

36:38.739 --> 36:41.776
Desmond didn't know you
when he first came out of there.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.277
That means you never met.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.610
Which means you can't meet.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.911
This'd be fascinating
if I was listening.

36:47.998 --> 36:51.490
How do you know Desmond is even
in there? It could be anybody.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.409
I don't care who's in there.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.085
- Wait.
- Open the damn door!

36:59.176 --> 37:00.882
- It won't work.
- Sure it will.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.426
Open up! It's the ghost
of Christmas future!

37:03.514 --> 37:05.425
No one is gonna answer.

37:05.516 --> 37:07.427
Open the damn door!
Open the door!

37:07.518 --> 37:10.385
- You're wasting your time.
- I know you can hear me!

37:10.479 --> 37:13.391
If it didn't happen, it can't happen.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.190
You can't change the past, James!

37:18.320 --> 37:21.733
Everybody I cared about
just blew up on your damn boat.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.991
I know what I can't change.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.409
We should get back to the beach.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.292
It's been a long day.

37:56.525 --> 38:00.017
Why are we going back to the beach
if there's nothing to go back to?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.852
So stay here.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.861
That chick likes me.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.159
What?

38:16.253 --> 38:18.118
What's the matter?

38:21.550 --> 38:24.383
I haven't had a nosebleed
since I was little.

38:26.430 --> 38:30.469
- Dan, I'm fine.
- No. Of course you're fine.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.424
l'm...

38:32.519 --> 38:33.895
The sight of blood is...

38:34.313 --> 38:37.521
It's a good thing you're a physicist,
isn't it? Shall we?

38:37.608 --> 38:39.394
Yeah.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.101
My pack.

38:42.196 --> 38:46.360
I left my pack back at the hatch crater.
You head back with everyone else.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.236
I'll be right behind you.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.192
Don't dilly-dally.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.618
I wouldn't think of it.

39:22.486 --> 39:25.319
Please, let this work.
Please, let this work.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.067
Please, please, please, let this work.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.993
Don't shoot!

39:38.961 --> 39:42.579
Explain why you've been banging
on my door for 20 minutes, brother.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.922
Desmond.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.925
- Are you him?
- "Him" who?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.630
My replacement.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.684
No, I'm not.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.682
I'm not. I'm not.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.848
Do I know you?

40:02.943 --> 40:06.151
Yeah, in a way.

40:06.238 --> 40:09.822
But, listen, that's not important.
What is important, Desmond,

40:09.908 --> 40:12.900
is what I'm about to say to you.
I need you to listen.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.407
You're the only person who can help us

40:15.497 --> 40:20.287
because, Desmond,
the rules don't apply to you.

40:20.377 --> 40:22.914
You're special.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.371
You're uniquely
and miraculously special.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.205
What are you talking about?!

40:32.306 --> 40:34.171
Listen to me. Listen!

40:34.266 --> 40:37.850
lfthe helicopter
somehow made it off the island,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.268
- if you got home...
- What helicopter?!

40:40.355 --> 40:43.017
I need you to listen,
or people are gonna die.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.726
My name is Daniel Faraday.

40:46.820 --> 40:50.529
Right now, me and everyone else
you left behind,

40:50.616 --> 40:54.074
we're in serious danger. You're
the only person who can help us.

40:54.161 --> 40:57.198
I need you to go back
to Oxford University.

40:57.289 --> 41:01.032
Back to where we met. I need you to go
and find my mother. Her name is...

41:08.634 --> 41:10.340
Are you all right?

41:17.351 --> 41:19.137
l was on the island.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.013
l was on the island.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.563
You've been off the island
for three years now.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.612
You're safe now.
It was just a dream.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.325
It wasn't a dream, Penny.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.411
It was a memory.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.206
Desmond, where are you going?

41:59.851 --> 42:01.136
Des?

42:04.106 --> 42:06.563
Desmond. What are you doing?

42:07.943 --> 42:10.650
- We're leaving.
- Leaving to go where?

42:15.283 --> 42:16.784
Oxford.
