00:59.768 --> 01:02.079
Would you like to step out
and have a cigarette, Mr Graham?

01:02.446 --> 01:03.172
No, thank you.

01:03.997 --> 01:04.840
We'll call you as soon as we know.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.567
No.

01:07.434 --> 01:08.894
I understand.

01:34.936 --> 01:36.313
She'll be alright now, Mr Graham.

01:36.780 --> 01:37.823
Thank you.

01:43.829 --> 01:45.923
Did you ever have any trouble
with it before, Mr Graham?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.200
Well, I have to take it in
2 or 3 times a week.

01:48.207 --> 01:50.440
Which is somewhat inconvenient,
but the car is well worth it.

01:50.628 --> 01:52.805
2 or 3 times a week?
How often do you drive it?

01:53.130 --> 01:54.456
2 or 3 times a week.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.333
I have to take it in every time I drive it.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.961
And then it usually needs
a tune-up every few weeks.

01:59.044 --> 02:01.255
So I actually don't get
to drive it very much.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.966
Oh, you have a real
problem then, Mr Graham.

02:04.049 --> 02:06.051
Yes. My own mechanic
has not been very helpful.

02:06.176 --> 02:07.511
Is there anything you can recommend?

02:07.678 --> 02:09.763
Well ... you don't live
out here on the island, so ...

02:10.764 --> 02:13.559
I can't check it regularly enough
to get a real picture.

02:13.978 --> 02:19.773
All I can advise is never drive her under
3,000 rpm in a forward gear. Ever.

02:20.816 --> 02:22.776
And there's a lot of carbon on the valves.

02:22.901 --> 02:26.196
Yes, there always is. So thank you
very much for the recommendation.

02:34.872 --> 02:37.416
Usually needs a tune-up every few weeks.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.960
I wonder what he does to her that bad.

03:29.093 --> 03:32.600
Oh, Mr Graham. Your attorney, Mr Beckett,
has been trying to reach you.

03:33.096 --> 03:35.516
He's been calling the
superintendent's office all week.

03:35.557 --> 03:38.100
Well, if he calls again tell him
I no longer live with the superintendent.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.604
Have this car taken to my garage.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.856
- Broke down again, didn't it?
- I don't care to discuss it.

03:42.982 --> 03:45.359
... and he told me there
was carbon on the valves ...

03:45.442 --> 03:48.362
which was no news to me 'cause
there's always carbon on the valves.

03:49.154 --> 03:50.900
My own mechanic picked up
the car yesterday ...

03:51.200 --> 03:55.119
and returned this afternoon with the news
that there was carbon on the valves.

03:55.744 --> 03:58.288
I asked him why the car
broke down so frequently ...

03:58.330 --> 04:01.125
and he said it was probably because
carbon got on the valves.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.919
Ha ha, I told you a Ferrari
was useless in the city.

04:04.086 --> 04:05.921
Buy a Bentley and stop carrying on.

04:06.005 --> 04:06.964
How dare you?

04:07.089 --> 04:07.965
Mr Graham!

04:08.300 --> 04:11.325
- Henry! Henry!
- What a day. That's a perfectly insane ...

04:11.600 --> 04:14.555
- Oh, Mr Graham!
- Who is it? What is it?

04:15.431 --> 04:17.349
- A Mr Beckett on the phone!
- Beckett?

04:18.017 --> 04:22.728
Says he's your attorney!
Has an urgent message. Says he'll wait.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.624
Tell him I'm out.

04:25.649 --> 04:27.693
I don't have much chance to
take her out and open her up.

04:27.818 --> 04:31.572
Half the time is spent taking off and
the other half is spent on landing.

04:31.655 --> 04:33.157
And she needs a lot of upkeep.

04:33.365 --> 04:35.743
Every time I bring her out
she has to have repairs.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.745
What seems to be the trouble?

04:38.120 --> 04:41.290
My mechanic says it's carbon on the valves.

04:41.790 --> 04:45.336
Zero One Foxtrot.
This is Long Island tower.

04:45.461 --> 04:49.173
We're holding an emergency telephone call
for Mr Henry Graham...

04:49.256 --> 04:51.433
from his attorney, Mr Beckett.
Over.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.053
Roger. Zero One Foxtrot...

04:54.136 --> 04:57.765
I'll just get out here, thank you.
I'm not taking that call.

04:58.148 --> 05:00.017
Oh, Jerry!
Mr Von Rensaeller?

05:00.351 --> 05:02.353
Has Mr Graham come in yet?

05:02.478 --> 05:04.813
Yes. He's in the lounge with Mr Beaumont.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.776
Have I told you that my apple trees
have crown gall?

05:09.652 --> 05:10.819
Frequently.

05:10.861 --> 05:13.614
Well, then you can relax.
They don't anymore.

05:14.239 --> 05:16.533
I sprayed and the crown gall is gone.

05:19.161 --> 05:23.791
Hello, Dan. I was just telling Henry
that my apple trees had crown gall.

05:23.874 --> 05:26.293
But I sprayed and the crown gall is gone.

05:26.377 --> 05:30.005
Really? Oh, you must be very relieved.

05:30.089 --> 05:31.882
Yes. Yes, I am.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.884
Could I have a word with you, Henry?

05:34.677 --> 05:36.679
We've had several calls from your bank ...

05:36.762 --> 05:38.722
saying there have been insufficient funds.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.099
Ah, those idiots.

05:40.224 --> 05:43.936
I was prevailed upon as honorary secretary
to bring it to your attention ...

05:44.019 --> 05:46.063
so you can stir it up at the bank.

05:46.605 --> 05:48.649
Been going on for weeks.

05:51.944 --> 05:55.739
I wonder if Beckett would go this far
to get me to call back?

05:56.573 --> 06:00.911
Now, listen to me very carefully, please.
You see, when you have capital ...

06:00.995 --> 06:03.247
you are able to derive ... No.

06:03.372 --> 06:05.457
I will attend to the check
in a moment, Mr Graham.

06:05.541 --> 06:08.669
I understand about the check.
I'm trying to explain something to you ...

06:08.794 --> 06:10.379
that is terribly important.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.549
When we spend more,
per month or per year ...

06:13.674 --> 06:17.261
than we have in income,
you must then dip into the capital ...

06:17.386 --> 06:21.390
eventually exhausting the capital
and of course, therefore, the income.

06:21.432 --> 06:22.433
Do you see what I mean?

06:22.474 --> 06:25.185
Mr Beckett. This check must be paid.

06:25.811 --> 06:27.646
- Mr Graham ...
- And at once.

06:27.730 --> 06:31.692
I'm trying to explain to you that
it is impossible to pay the check ...

06:31.775 --> 06:34.820
because your expenses
have exceeded your income ...

06:34.862 --> 06:37.323
to such a point that you have
exhausted your capital.

06:37.448 --> 06:39.575
Now you have no capital, no income ...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.535
therefore no funds for the check, you see?

06:41.869 --> 06:44.496
Don't treat me as though
I were a child, Mr Beckett.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.834
I am as aware of what it means
to have no capital as you are.

06:49.001 --> 06:51.879
- Oh, good.
- Now, what about this check?

06:53.597 --> 06:56.836
Well, are you entirely sure
that you really do understand ...

06:57.214 --> 06:59.547
what I mean by ... capital, Mr Graham?

06:59.761 --> 07:02.681
You see, you've exhausted the capital.
I can't cover the check ...

07:02.765 --> 07:06.644
because the check is for $6,000
and you don't have $6,000.

07:06.810 --> 07:09.396
In other words, you don't have $60.

07:09.647 --> 07:10.856
Come to the point, Beckett.

07:12.816 --> 07:14.777
The point, Mr Graham, is that
you don't have any money.

07:14.943 --> 07:18.614
The capital and the income are exhausted
and you no longer have any money.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.240
I wish there was some
other way I could say it.

07:20.324 --> 07:22.880
What could I ...?
How could I put it? That money ...

07:22.903 --> 07:26.970
You have no capital, you have no income ...
you have ... no, it's only money.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.100
You have no money. There's no other
way to put it.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.251
You mean I have no money?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.671
Yes, that's what I mean.
You have no money.

07:33.837 --> 07:37.174
And what of my stocks, my AT&T,
my General Motors?

07:37.299 --> 07:38.080
Y-yes, I know ...

07:38.095 --> 07:39.128
My Emeralda Peat?

07:39.186 --> 07:42.386
Yes, yes, I know about Emeralda Peat.
Let me show you something.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.849
Mr Graham, you see,
it was necessary for me to sell ...

07:45.933 --> 07:49.019
several shares per year in order
to cover the checks that you ...

07:49.103 --> 07:51.200
- Who gave you the right to do that ?
- You did, sir.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.982
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

07:53.107 --> 07:57.486
See, 15 years ago, when you told me
that you wished to live on $200,000 ...

07:57.569 --> 08:01.991
despite the fact that the income
on your trust fund was only $90,000 ...

08:02.324 --> 08:06.412
That is beside the point.
This check must be paid.

08:06.495 --> 08:09.790
Do you realize that this check has
bounced, Mr Beckett? I mean, bounced!

08:09.915 --> 08:13.085
- As though I were some indigent ...
- Yes, I know the check has bounced.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.629
It is not the first check that
you've had bounced, Mr Graham.

08:15.713 --> 08:19.804
I personally have covered three overdrafts
of yours to the extent ...

08:19.933 --> 08:23.200
- I'd like to show you
this check - of $550.

08:23.554 --> 08:25.848
This is of my own money, not the
firm's money, but that is not ...

08:25.973 --> 08:28.309
a policy that I wish
to continue in the future.

08:28.517 --> 08:29.810
Who gave you the right to do that?

08:29.893 --> 08:31.645
Well, you did, Mr Graham.

08:31.729 --> 08:35.982
You mean to say that I'm now in
the position of owing you $550?

08:36.191 --> 08:39.653
No, no, no, don't, don't, please,
don't think of it as a loan, Mr Graham.

08:39.945 --> 08:43.866
I have no more hope of receiving it than
you'll ever have of scraping it up.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.909
Oh, thank you very much, Mr Beckett.

08:45.993 --> 08:49.663
May I say that if you expected even
the smallest amount of gratitude ...

08:49.747 --> 08:53.417
you have wasted $550
of the excessive fee I pay you ...

08:53.500 --> 08:55.669
for the tiny services you render.

08:58.255 --> 09:03.344
Mr Graham.
I would like to explain something to you.

09:03.469 --> 09:10.267
I have given you $550 of my own money
for only one reason ...

09:10.351 --> 09:15.397
Disliking you as intensely as I do,
I wanted to be absolutely certain ...

09:15.648 --> 09:18.692
that when I looked back
upon your financial downfall ...

09:18.776 --> 09:22.738
I could absolve myself completely
of any responsibility for it.

09:22.821 --> 09:27.068
And $550 is a relatively
small price to pay ...

09:27.251 --> 09:30.330
for the knowledge that I've
had nothing to do whatsoever ...

09:30.468 --> 09:32.201
with your financial downfall.

09:32.255 --> 09:35.776
You have brought yourself
to penury entirely on your own.

09:36.001 --> 09:39.171
I don't suppose you care
to give me an additional $6,000 ...

09:39.254 --> 09:42.007
and insure yourself against
guilt permanently?

09:45.469 --> 09:48.639
- You're perfect.
- Thank you very much, Mr Beckett.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.849
Do you think my uncle would
lend me some money?

09:51.892 --> 09:57.314
Mr Graham, during the 10 years that
your uncle served as your guardian ...

09:57.439 --> 09:59.984
he confided in me almost daily ...

10:00.109 --> 10:04.321
that he thought your father had placed him
in that position as an act of spite.

10:04.738 --> 10:08.191
I don't think he'll give you a nickel,
Mr Graham.

10:08.516 --> 10:11.639
And considering your gift for
close personal relationships ...

10:11.702 --> 10:13.602
I don't think anyone else will, either.

10:13.622 --> 10:16.875
Thank you very much, Mr Beckett.

10:17.751 --> 10:26.093
Here you are. This will cover the
overdraft of $550 that I owe you.

10:27.218 --> 10:29.432
You will have these, too.

10:29.512 --> 10:32.245
They're non-filter.
Smoke them in good health.

10:45.295 --> 10:46.947
I'm poor.

11:06.691 --> 11:08.235
Goodbye.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.217
Goodbye.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.144
Goodbye.

11:28.864 --> 11:32.367
Oh, Mr Graham, how are you?
Nice to see you.

11:34.211 --> 11:36.778
- What can I do for you, Mr Graham?
- Oh nothing, nothing ... I ...

11:37.100 --> 11:42.500
- Won't you sit down a little bit?
- Thank you. I was looking ... for someone.

11:54.498 --> 11:57.100
- Good afternoon, Mr Graham.
- Henri, ça va bien?

11:57.100 --> 12:00.000
I'm fine, thank you. I'm kind of surprised.
We're gonna be ready any minute.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.200
Would you like to have a table for one?

12:02.747 --> 12:09.788
No, no, thank you. I just wanted to ...
look at the room once more.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.919
But it's always great to see you.
You're always welcome here. You know that.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.333
- Just check.
- I'm sorry, Mr Sullivan.

12:20.335 --> 12:23.102
I know nothing more
about your application.

12:23.353 --> 12:26.153
That's alright. I'll come back
tomorrow and check.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.500
- Oh, Mr Graham. Good afternoon, Mr Graham.
- Hello, Arthur.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.500
Were you expecting some mail?

12:35.100 --> 12:43.765
No, no. I just ... dropped in to, er
 ... see if I was still welcome.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.300
I'm poor.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.340
Go!

14:21.520 --> 14:25.900
- Harold , I should like to ask you something.
- Certainly, sir.

14:26.391 --> 14:28.400
You've been with me
for many years now, Harold.

14:29.003 --> 14:32.507
What would you do if I told you
I had lost all my money?

14:33.032 --> 14:36.135
I should leave immediately, sir,
upon giving the proper notice.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.750
Thank you, Harold. I knew I could
count on a straight answer from you.

14:40.985 --> 14:41.985
Thank you, sir.

14:53.627 --> 14:56.200
You can't top Hart, Schaffner and Marx.

14:58.649 --> 15:03.600
Just stand natural.
It fits perfectly.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.858
It's the best suit you can find in
ready-to-wear.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.326
I'm sorry, Mr Graham.

15:09.535 --> 15:14.214
The racket club does not keep those members
on a trust that worry missing their dues.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.600
Don't waste your time, Mr Graham,
come with me to the Y.

15:17.651 --> 15:23.323
Henry, you're not ... you're not
driving a Chevrolet!?

15:24.842 --> 15:25.892
Oh, no!

15:28.178 --> 15:30.138
I took the liberty, sir.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.908
Oh yes, yes, Harold, bring it in.
I was just about to ring for it.

15:36.762 --> 15:40.057
- Harold, I have something to tell you.
- Is it about your money, sir?

15:40.948 --> 15:43.117
Yes, Harold. I've lost it.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.346
Or, more accurately, spent it.
In any case, it's gone.

15:47.089 --> 15:48.298
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.234
Have you considered borrowing
from your uncle?

15:51.676 --> 15:53.386
Yes, it was my first thought.

15:53.795 --> 15:57.298
My attorney advised me against it on
the grounds that it would be useless.

15:58.383 --> 15:59.746
See, the thing of it is, Harold ...

15:59.803 --> 16:03.336
that I have no hope of ever
repaying him, or anyone.

16:05.190 --> 16:08.526
I have no skills,
no resources, no ambitions.

16:09.644 --> 16:12.438
All I am, or was, is rich.

16:12.563 --> 16:14.315
And that's all I ever wanted to be.

16:15.984 --> 16:19.287
I don't understand, Harold.
Why did it happen to me? Why?

16:19.730 --> 16:23.100
I was ... I was so happy.
What will I do?

16:23.534 --> 16:25.619
What any gentleman of similar breeding ...

16:25.702 --> 16:28.830
and temperament would do
in your position, sir.

16:28.872 --> 16:29.589
Suicide?

16:29.673 --> 16:32.551
No, sir. I wasn't going to suggest suicide.
I was going to suggest marriage.

16:32.934 --> 16:35.103
Marriage? You mean to a woman?

16:35.228 --> 16:36.938
Yes, sir. That is what I had in mind.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.549
It's the only way to acquire
property without labor.

16:39.574 --> 16:41.652
There is inheritance, but
I believe your uncle ...

16:41.735 --> 16:46.081
has already stated his intention of leaving
everything he owns to Radio Free Europe.

16:46.431 --> 16:50.519
Oh, I can't, Harold. I couldn't ...
I mean, she'd be there ...

16:50.644 --> 16:52.312
asking me where I've been ...

16:52.437 --> 16:55.315
talking to me ... talking.
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

16:55.774 --> 17:00.237
Well, it was only a suggestion, sir.
But the alternatives ...

17:00.445 --> 17:03.824
are very limited and
unspeakably depressing, sir.

17:03.866 --> 17:06.242
If you do not commit suicide,
sir, you will be poor.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.319
Poor?

17:07.386 --> 17:09.847
Poor in the only real
sense of the word, sir ...

17:09.887 --> 17:11.131
in that you will not be rich.

17:11.373 --> 17:14.459
You will have a little left
if you sold everything but ...

17:14.584 --> 17:17.587
in a country where
every man is what he has ...

17:17.628 --> 17:20.589
he who has very little is nobody very much.

17:20.714 --> 17:23.801
There's no such thing as
genteel poverty here, sir.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.872
How much time do you think I have
before it comes out, Harold?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.156
Hardly any, sir.

17:28.198 --> 17:29.992
You've already received
your third notice ...

17:30.033 --> 17:33.287
from both Con Edison and the
Bell Telephone Company, sir.

17:34.455 --> 17:37.499
At any moment the lights may go out and
the telephone go dead.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.461
And when that happens,
the worst will occur, sir...

17:40.944 --> 17:43.780
your credit rating will be impudent.

17:43.864 --> 17:46.950
My Emeralda Peat.
Thank you.

17:49.452 --> 17:52.080
Oh, do it, sir. Do it, get married, sir.

17:53.123 --> 17:57.586
Take the plunge.
Find a nice suitable young woman, sir.

17:57.794 --> 18:01.339
Borrow enough money from your uncle
to keep up appearances.

18:01.590 --> 18:05.469
Don't become poor, Henry Graham, sir.
Not just for your sake but ...

18:05.594 --> 18:08.263
this is difficult for me to say, sir,
but for mine as well ...

18:08.430 --> 18:12.350
I mean, how many men these days require
the services of a gentleman's gentleman?

18:12.434 --> 18:15.645
How many men have
your devotion to form, sir?

18:15.996 --> 18:18.456
You have managed in
your own lifetime, Mr Graham ...

18:18.482 --> 18:22.152
to keep alive traditions that were dead
before you were born.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.654
Don't give up the fight, sir ...

18:24.738 --> 18:27.407
just because the Philistines are upon thee.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.952
I now respectfully give
two weeks' notice, sir.

18:31.077 --> 18:31.995
Will that be all?

18:32.496 --> 18:35.040
- Yes.
- Thank you, sir.

18:40.754 --> 18:49.137
No, no. Can't. Can't.
Better death or murder.

18:51.056 --> 18:54.851
That's a good idea. Harold!

18:57.479 --> 19:00.440
Harold, that was a good idea.
I'm going to do it, Harold.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.318
I'm going to find a suitable woman
and mur-, er, marry her.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.946
Oh, I'm so glad, sir.

19:06.029 --> 19:09.491
- Shall I dial your uncle for you?
- Yes, please, Harold.

19:09.699 --> 19:12.828
I hope I don't have to grovel too much.

19:29.177 --> 19:31.429
Can I take it your answer is no?

19:31.555 --> 19:35.300
Yes. It's no. You've been an ass, Henry.

19:35.356 --> 19:39.056
Just as your father was an ass, but you
mustn't take that to mean it runs in the family.

19:39.312 --> 19:44.985
Lend you $50,000.
Oh God, what a witty thing to say!

19:45.068 --> 19:48.155
Don't think of it as a loan
but as an investment ...

19:48.780 --> 19:51.908
to be repaid in six weeks
with interest of 10%.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.400
No.

19:54.744 --> 19:59.100
Why not? It's a better return
than you get on any stock.

19:59.383 --> 20:01.960
But you are not a stock, Henry.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.700
You are an aging youth, with no prospect ...

20:07.257 --> 20:10.552
no skills, no character.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.700
What could you possibly do in six weeks ...

20:12.900 --> 20:14.473
that would enable you to repay me?

20:14.623 --> 20:16.141
Get married.

20:16.216 --> 20:16.925
Get what?

20:17.134 --> 20:17.718
Get married.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.644
Get married?

20:18.769 --> 20:19.395
Yes. Get married.

20:19.478 --> 20:20.104
To whom?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.973
Well, I ... I would find a suitable woman.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.059
By "suitable" you mean rich?

20:25.184 --> 20:27.186
Yes, as far as marriage is concerned ...

20:33.567 --> 20:35.277
You see, as far as marriage is ...

20:40.991 --> 20:43.869
As far as marriage is concerned,
I do have prospects.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.214
I even have skills, to the extent that
I'm not physically disabled.

20:47.500 --> 20:47.900
No.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.833
I'm reasonably well-mannered.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.587
And I can engage in
any romantic activity ...

20:53.712 --> 20:56.382
with an urbanity born of disinterest.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.260
As for character ...

20:59.385 --> 21:01.720
that is something I usually
require of servants ...

21:07.685 --> 21:10.178
- We are talking about character.
- Yes, character.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.665
That is something I usually
require of servants ...

21:13.691 --> 21:17.361
in the form of a brief letter
written by someone like myself ...

21:17.486 --> 21:19.989
to the effect that
the servant in question ...

21:20.114 --> 21:22.449
does not have the ingenuity to steal.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.995
Well, you can't ask for better
credentials for marriage ...

21:26.078 --> 21:28.038
or a better return on your investment.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.834
What is my collateral
in the event that you fail?

21:32.251 --> 21:33.335
Collateral?

21:35.129 --> 21:37.214
My wardrobe and furnishings.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.634
Oh my God, what would I ...?
Yes, go on.

21:43.012 --> 21:44.638
My collection of first editions.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.224
- My paintings and sculptures.
- Oh, well.

21:48.601 --> 21:50.477
- And my ...
- What?

21:50.603 --> 21:52.896
- No.
- No, what?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.442
Well ... that's it.

21:56.609 --> 22:00.279
No, no. You said no. You said no.
What? No, what?

22:00.487 --> 22:04.283
Alright. My Ferrari 275 GTB 4 ...

22:04.742 --> 22:10.497
which retails at $15,900
and is owned outright by me.

22:11.165 --> 22:14.084
That's at least $500,000
worth of collateral.

22:14.710 --> 22:16.837
I'm asking for a $50,000 loan.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.551
- Six weeks?
- Six weeks.

22:23.469 --> 22:27.097
Well, I may be a sentimental old fool ...

22:28.891 --> 22:36.190
but in memory of our long, long years
that I spent as your guardian ...

22:38.525 --> 22:39.526
I'll do it.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.363
Thank you, uncle.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.073
- On one condition.
- What's that?

22:45.449 --> 22:47.534
Should you fail to repay
me in six weeks ...

22:47.618 --> 22:50.079
I am entitled to ten times
the amount I'll lend you.

22:50.204 --> 22:54.667
Ten times the amount?
That's ten times 50,000.

22:54.833 --> 22:55.960
Yes, that's right.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.589
That's ... it's everything ... I ... own.

23:01.257 --> 23:03.759
Of course you could always go to
a bank and ask for a personal loan.

23:03.801 --> 23:05.469
A bank?

23:08.013 --> 23:10.933
Oh God, if I could be a fly
on the wall that day.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.690
Those are my terms. Take them
or leave them as you choose.

23:17.773 --> 23:19.817
- But that's usury.
- Mh-hm.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.443
- I'll take it.
- Good.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.570
I'll have my attorney
draw up the documents tonight.

23:23.821 --> 23:25.364
We should be finished by tonight,
don't you think?

23:25.489 --> 23:28.367
Yes. Thank you, uncle.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.619
Call me Uncle Harry...

23:30.786 --> 23:34.123
After all, we're in business
together now, Henry.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.042
Thank you, Uncle Harry.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.670
In that case, you may call me Mr Graham.

23:39.878 --> 23:43.841
You know, Henry, I have never thought
of you as terribly interested in women.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.343
It comes as rather a shock to me, too.

23:46.552 --> 23:47.928
- Are there any here?
- Huh?

23:48.095 --> 23:49.638
I mean ... unattached ones?

23:49.930 --> 23:54.059
Yes, yes, there's Sharon Hart,
over there next to Felix.

23:54.143 --> 23:55.769
Does she live with her family?

23:55.978 --> 23:58.731
No, no, as far as I know,
Sharon has no close family.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.900
Her husband, Robert Hart,
was a cattle baron, I think.

24:02.109 --> 24:02.943
Really?

24:03.110 --> 24:06.280
Oh, Sharon, I'd like you
to meet Henry Graham.

24:11.243 --> 24:14.705
I eat, I sleep, I swim, I dry off.

24:15.247 --> 24:21.378
All so simple, perhaps even primitive.
And it satisfies me.

24:21.587 --> 24:24.340
I have found peace in Connecticut.

24:24.465 --> 24:27.009
I mean, after all, what else is there?

24:27.134 --> 24:32.890
I love, I wish love, I am human,
I am a woman, Henry!

24:33.390 --> 24:34.350
A what?

24:34.433 --> 24:36.226
A woman, Henry.

24:36.435 --> 24:41.523
I want ... I need ... I desire love.

24:41.732 --> 24:43.484
That is what a woman is born for.

24:46.070 --> 24:47.488
Damn mosquitoes!

24:48.739 --> 24:54.203
No mother? You have no mother? No father?
No ... no children? No one at all?

24:54.662 --> 24:56.080
No one at all.

24:56.497 --> 24:58.249
Oh, Henry ...

24:59.291 --> 25:02.086
How I long to hear another voice.

25:02.294 --> 25:03.837
A man's arms ...

25:06.340 --> 25:09.093
Oh, I am alive.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.804
I want to give ...

25:13.555 --> 25:14.890
love.

25:16.350 --> 25:17.101
Darling!

25:17.559 --> 25:19.103
No! Don't let them out!

25:20.980 --> 25:25.109
3 weeks, 2 days and 3 hours to go, sir.

25:25.859 --> 25:29.029
- Please don't scratch, sir.
- Oh, God help me!

25:34.994 --> 25:37.329
My aunt got very interested
in the Heart Fund.

25:37.538 --> 25:39.290
She had an attack a little while ago.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.001
Your aunt ...
Does she live in New York?

25:42.167 --> 25:43.752
Yes, as a matter of fact she does.

25:43.919 --> 25:46.213
- What sort of an attack did she have?
- A heart attack, you see ...

25:46.672 --> 25:49.550
- Oh, do you have any other relatives?
- Oh no, no, none at all.

25:49.675 --> 25:52.177
- No mother?
- No, no, no mother. And ...

25:52.303 --> 25:54.555
- No father?
- No, no. No, no father.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.701
We were wondering if you would
like to put your name ...

25:56.789 --> 25:58.989
on one of our letterheads
as one of our sponsors ...?

25:59.242 --> 26:01.914
- Well, you wouldn't have to do anything.
- No, thank you.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.369
Oh. Well, would you ...?

26:04.589 --> 26:06.967
Henry!
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

26:07.276 --> 26:09.862
I thought you hated dancing and
didn't believe in private charity.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.155
You were correct.

26:17.828 --> 26:21.790
One week, 5 days and 10 hours, sir.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.294
I'll never do it, Harold. Never.

26:25.336 --> 26:27.755
Not only do I still have to meet her,
but I have to court her ...

26:27.796 --> 26:30.341
marry her and get $50.000 from her ...

26:30.424 --> 26:32.009
before the honeymoon.
I'll never do it ...

26:32.051 --> 26:33.302
unless I elope tomorrow.

26:33.344 --> 26:34.970
You will do it, sir.

26:35.012 --> 26:38.641
When we are working for something we
really love, as you are, sir ...

26:38.682 --> 26:41.101
we can always find a way.

26:42.581 --> 26:45.348
What are you spraying, Bo? Do you
really understand what you're doing?

26:45.550 --> 26:52.517
Oh, my dear. I've spent years on this,
on this very topic. Yes, because ...

26:55.532 --> 26:56.784
<i>Henry!</i>

26:58.827 --> 27:01.163
Everybody! This is Henry Graham.

27:01.247 --> 27:05.075
- This is Harriet Storch. Bo, of course, you know.
- Hi, Henry.

27:05.459 --> 27:09.922
Mr and Mrs Sims, Toot and Roggie.
They're here from Geneva on home leave.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.132
This is Lucy Sylvester.

27:12.174 --> 27:15.219
And our neighbours,
Dr and Mrs Daryl Hitler

27:15.302 --> 27:18.847
John Sylvester and Freddy,
of course, you know ...

27:20.307 --> 27:23.310
Excuse me, you're not by any chance
related to the Boston Hitlers?

27:23.435 --> 27:25.271
No, we're from Glen Cove.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.856
Henry, this is Ms Henrietta Lowell.
This is Mr Henry Graham.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.153
Ms Lowell. How do you do?

27:34.885 --> 27:37.085
Come there, now. Come and see Bo.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.869
Yes. You dropped your gloves, Ms Lowell.

27:41.078 --> 27:44.039
Now come with me and have a nice chat
with Bo while I get you some ...

27:44.081 --> 27:47.334
- Gloria, what's today's date?
- July 27.

27:47.918 --> 27:50.004
Come sit with Bo and I'll
get you some nice tea.

27:50.129 --> 27:54.133
Henry, sit down. Would you believe it?
Sooty blotch!

27:54.425 --> 27:57.094
Got rid of the crown gall
and got sooty blotch.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.512
I think it's sooty blotch, I'm not sure.

27:58.554 --> 28:02.433
That's becoming mad, Bo.
By the way, who's Henrietta Lowell?

28:03.642 --> 28:06.979
- She's old Guy Lowell's daughter.
- And who's old Guy Lowell?

28:08.772 --> 28:10.733
Was. He's dead now.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.443
<i>Been dead ever since I can remember.</i>

28:12.610 --> 28:15.487
And who was he when he was alive?

28:15.696 --> 28:17.281
Well, he was an industrialist ...

28:18.157 --> 28:20.367
... or composer, something like that.

28:22.411 --> 28:27.875
Well, did he die with his wealth intact or ...
did he lose everything in suicide ...?

28:28.334 --> 28:30.544
Oh, well, I'm merely curious.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.796
Well, he died with his wealth intact ...

28:36.508 --> 28:39.345
I heard he was enormously wealthy
when he died. Is that right?

28:39.887 --> 28:41.597
I thought you didn't know who he was.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.890
Well, I didn't at first ...

28:42.932 --> 28:45.225
but the vividness of your description
has restored him to my memory.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.187
He was old Guy Lowell,
who died enormously wealthy.

28:48.228 --> 28:52.441
- That right?
- Yeah. He was enormously wealthy when he died.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.109
And the girl?

28:54.151 --> 28:58.739
She's enormously wealthy, too.
Lives all alone in a huge place with ...

28:58.781 --> 29:02.910
dozens of servants milling about her.
About 50 acres of land.

29:04.328 --> 29:06.247
- No mother?
- No.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.792
No sisters, brothers?
No close relatives?

29:10.042 --> 29:14.505
No. No. Harry, you're hurting my arm!

29:14.546 --> 29:16.840
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Bo.

29:18.592 --> 29:20.010
She, er ... she's not engaged?

29:20.177 --> 29:24.223
No. She's a botanist!

29:24.348 --> 29:26.016
<i>She teaches at some ...</i>

29:26.267 --> 29:31.188
<i>Writes a lot of papers
on ... fronds ... for periodicals.</i>

29:31.230 --> 29:32.982
<i>Doesn't ride, either.</i>

29:33.023 --> 29:36.986
Doesn't entertain. Doesn't even talk,
as far as I can tell.

29:37.444 --> 29:40.114
<i>I think she's about the most isolated
woman I've ever met.</i>

29:40.781 --> 29:42.950
Rich, single, isolated.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.996
And she's about to drop that teacup.

29:53.085 --> 29:55.796
Oh, she's perfect.

29:56.088 --> 29:58.966
Madeleine, would you get Ms Lowell
another cup of tea, please?

29:59.091 --> 30:02.485
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's alright, dear, really. Couldn't care less.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.600
It's nothing. It's nothing.
It's just an old rug.

30:07.668 --> 30:14.900
Just swish that up and then just dab it,
just ... just dab it and blot it.

30:15.170 --> 30:16.533
Here ... I'll take this.

30:31.707 --> 30:35.294
Incredibly clumsy woman, isn't she?
No wonder she doesn't ride.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.505
Forgive me a moment, will you, Bo?

30:38.797 --> 30:40.049
Excuse me.

30:46.450 --> 30:47.629
Excuse me.

30:55.064 --> 30:58.192
Henrietta, is this some kind of joke?

30:58.359 --> 31:01.111
Because if it is, I do not find it amusing.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.614
If your nerves aren't steady enough ...

31:03.656 --> 31:07.159
to hold a cup and saucer in your hand,
then you shouldn't be drinking tea.

31:07.284 --> 31:11.671
- Once yes, but twice in a row ...
- Is too much ... too much.

31:12.081 --> 31:16.418
Madam. There you are, Madam.

31:16.460 --> 31:20.339
Take your damn carpet to the cleaners
and send the bill to me.

31:21.298 --> 31:23.500
Here you are. Come, Ms Lowell,
I'm taking you home.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.200
Take your bag.

31:27.972 --> 31:30.140
You son of a bitch!

31:30.224 --> 31:32.476
You dare call me a son of a bitch?

31:32.559 --> 31:36.105
Madam, I have seen many examples
of perversion in my time ...

31:36.146 --> 31:39.066
but your erotic obsession
with your carpet ...

31:39.108 --> 31:43.487
is probably the most grotesque and certainly
the most boring I have ever encountered.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.906
You're more to be scorned than pitied.

31:45.948 --> 31:47.825
Good day, Mrs Cunliffe.

32:00.087 --> 32:02.590
You can dismiss your car.
I'll take you home in mine.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.634
I came by bus.

32:07.553 --> 32:08.554
I beg your pardon?

32:08.596 --> 32:12.349
I ... I didn't come by car, I came by bus.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.901
- By bus?
- On the bus.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.312
And then to be treated in this manner?

32:24.528 --> 32:25.404
Perfect.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.741
This is very nice of you. Thank you.

32:28.782 --> 32:30.826
And I'm terribly sorry.

32:30.868 --> 32:33.412
No, you don't have to apologize, Ms Lowell.

32:33.579 --> 32:35.831
Your behavior has been impeccable.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.292
No. I did spill the tea twice.

32:38.334 --> 32:39.627
You were a guest.

32:39.668 --> 32:44.006
A woman of your stature has a right to expect
every courtesy in any home she consents to visit.

32:45.257 --> 32:46.467
What stature?

32:46.550 --> 32:47.968
Oh, come now, Ms Lowell.

32:48.093 --> 32:50.429
I've read far too many
botanical journals ...

32:50.471 --> 32:52.181
to take that question seriously.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.933
Are you a botanist?

32:54.350 --> 32:56.518
No. Just a botanical journal reader.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.979
Every science has its fans.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.608
Carbon on the valves.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.531
Tell me about yourself, Ms Lowell.

33:09.573 --> 33:11.909
Your work, your hopes, your dreams ...

33:12.243 --> 33:18.999
Well, I work as a teacher and I also
do field work and write monographs.

33:19.041 --> 33:23.337
On my last field trip I identified
and classified ...

33:23.379 --> 33:26.300
all the varieties of ferns
on Jolly Buoy.

33:26.548 --> 33:29.468
It was one of the longest
monographs I've ever written.

33:29.885 --> 33:31.887
I'd love to read it sometime.

33:32.638 --> 33:36.809
My hope is to discover a new
variety of fern ...

33:36.850 --> 33:40.020
that has never been
described or classified.

33:40.521 --> 33:42.773
I don't know what my dream is.

33:43.065 --> 33:45.109
Do you think it could be
the same as my hope?

33:50.364 --> 33:56.161
Well, in any way, that is my work and my hope,
except for my dreams which I'm not certain of.

33:57.871 --> 34:01.333
What happens if you discover a
new species ...

34:01.375 --> 34:04.295
that has never been
described or classified?

34:06.000 --> 34:10.342
Well ... nothing terribly much
except that ...

34:11.302 --> 34:14.638
you are  ...
you're listed as its discoverer ...

34:15.306 --> 34:18.266
and the entire species is named after you.

34:19.143 --> 34:24.523
Oh, like Parkinson's disease
being named after James Parkinson.

34:24.648 --> 34:26.317
That's right.

34:26.525 --> 34:29.527
Or the bougainvillea being named
after Louis de Bougainville.

34:29.570 --> 34:33.931
- Or like ... Brussels sprouts.
- Yes, that's right, that's right.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.327
It's a kind of immortality, isn't it?

34:36.659 --> 34:39.288
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

34:40.623 --> 34:44.668
This seems rather presumptuous,
doesn't it, to hope for immortality?

34:44.877 --> 34:46.003
Not to me.

34:47.004 --> 34:48.964
If you can't be immortal, why bother?

34:50.757 --> 34:56.472
Oh, Henry, you are really so ...
self-assured.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.390
You're so positive.

34:58.807 --> 35:02.519
It almost gives me confidence
just to be with you.

35:02.853 --> 35:06.398
Then in a very short time you will be
a very confident botanist because ...

35:06.440 --> 35:09.276
I intend to be with you
a great deal of the time.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.904
Oh, heavens.

35:12.363 --> 35:13.614
With your consent, of course.

35:14.281 --> 35:20.337
Oh, yes. I consent. I ... I just ...
Oh, heavens!

35:35.386 --> 35:39.014
- I will pick you up at 7.
- Yes. Bye.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.312
Until this evening.

35:45.479 --> 35:47.022
Heavens.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.488
Heavens.

35:55.656 --> 35:57.366
Good morning, Mis-

36:02.079 --> 36:03.372
Good morning, Mr Graham.

36:03.414 --> 36:06.917
You have exactly 7 days
and 9 hours to destitution.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.460
Shall I serve your breakfast in bed ...

36:08.502 --> 36:10.838
or would you like me to follow
you about with the tray?

36:10.921 --> 36:13.382
No, thank you, Harold.
I haven't got time to eat.

36:13.424 --> 36:16.093
See if you can find a
college outline of botany.

36:16.135 --> 36:18.470
Reserve a table for two
at Pavillion for tonight.

36:18.512 --> 36:21.181
Get the florist on the phone and start
making out a guest list.

36:21.348 --> 36:24.435
I think I have found,
God help us, Ms Right.

36:29.607 --> 36:33.736
Heavens. How tasteful.

36:36.488 --> 36:39.742
'55 was a glorious year
for Mouton Rothschild.

36:40.284 --> 36:42.620
Better than '53, I think.
Don't you?

36:43.537 --> 36:44.955
May I ask you something?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.457
Certainly, Henrietta.

36:47.249 --> 36:49.043
Have you ever tasted ...

36:49.084 --> 36:54.089
Mogen David's extra-heavy Malaga
wine with soda and lime juice?

36:56.383 --> 36:58.719
Er, not that I can recall.

37:00.429 --> 37:03.599
One of my students happened
to introduce it to me ...

37:03.641 --> 37:05.726
on a field trip to the Canary Islands.

37:06.518 --> 37:11.065
It tastes a little like grape juice
and every year is good.

37:11.273 --> 37:13.609
Why don't you just drink grape juice?

37:14.193 --> 37:16.195
It's not as sweet.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.907
I had never drunk wine at all
until I tried ...

37:19.949 --> 37:24.870
Mogen David's extra-heavy Malaga wine
with soda and lime juice.

37:25.162 --> 37:28.791
It's delicious.
It's called a Malaga cooler.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.584
Malaga cooler.

37:31.710 --> 37:37.258
Oh, well that ... sounds ... unique.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.800
- Thank you, Laurent.
- You're welcome, sir.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.186
- Thank you, Laurent.
- You're welcome, Mr Graham. Good night.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.300
- Good night, Mr Graham.
- Night, steward, thank you very much.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.900
- Good to see you again, sir.
- Thank you.

38:09.290 --> 38:13.010
- 5 days and 11 hours.
- Today is Wednesday, isn't it?
- Yes.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.962
Then the ceremony will have to be
this Saturday ...

38:15.004 --> 38:17.965
that means that I will have to
propose tonight, God help me ...

38:18.007 --> 38:19.800
if we're to get license by Friday ...

38:20.259 --> 38:24.054
Do you know anything about Mendel's
experiments? Listen to me, please, Harold.

38:24.096 --> 38:27.182
- Mendel's experiments with garden peas?
- No.

38:27.266 --> 38:30.144
Well, bone up and study the chapter
on classification.

38:30.227 --> 38:32.271
I'll have to have someone test me ...

38:32.313 --> 38:36.859
on division, class, order, family, genus,
species and variety ...

38:37.067 --> 38:39.778
before I go on to seed and fruit dispersal.

38:39.820 --> 38:42.865
Oh, I'm so glad you found a nice
suitable young lady.

38:42.907 --> 38:44.533
She's not suitable. She's primitive.

38:44.575 --> 38:47.202
She has no spirit,
no wit, no conversation ...

38:47.244 --> 38:49.413
and she has to be vacuumed
every time she eats.

38:49.455 --> 38:51.874
Oh, she must be very wealthy, sir.

38:51.916 --> 38:52.833
Yes, she is.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.793
Cancel my theater tickets for tonight.

38:54.835 --> 38:57.630
I'll have to start early if
I'm going to propose.

38:57.922 --> 39:01.175
Yes, sir. Oh, shall I order
additional champagne, sir?

39:01.216 --> 39:02.843
No. No champagne.

39:02.885 --> 39:05.763
Order a dozen bottles of ...

39:06.096 --> 39:11.685
Mogen David's extra-heavy Malaga wine
and lime juice.

39:11.727 --> 39:14.438
And lower your eyebrows, please.
I told you she was primitive.

39:22.071 --> 39:23.155
To science.

39:27.993 --> 39:29.411
Do you have any straws?

39:30.537 --> 39:33.749
Straws? No straws.

39:35.251 --> 39:37.419
Should have told you to buy straws.

39:49.698 --> 39:52.076
I have recently been re-reading
Gregor Mendel's ...

39:52.201 --> 39:54.703
fascinating experiments with garden peas.

39:55.746 --> 39:57.331
And it has struck me again ...

39:57.498 --> 40:00.626
how much we owe our understanding
of plant genetics ...

40:00.668 --> 40:04.546
with all its myriad implications
to that brilliant pioneer.

40:04.630 --> 40:08.384
Yes, but we mustn't forget
Morgan and Muller.

40:08.926 --> 40:12.471
- Morgan, Muller and Mendel.
- Who?

40:13.180 --> 40:15.808
Gregor Mendel, the man
that you just mentioned.

40:15.849 --> 40:18.686
Morgan, Muller and Mendel, I think ...

40:18.769 --> 40:21.355
are a perfect example of
scientific synthesis.

40:22.648 --> 40:25.651
Erm ... does it seem that to you?

40:25.693 --> 40:26.985
No, it doesn't.

40:27.069 --> 40:29.613
Collective appraisal has
never appealed to me.

40:29.697 --> 40:31.407
- Oh, I didn't mean to criticize ...
- Ooh!

40:33.909 --> 40:37.246
Oh, your carpet. Your beautiful carpet.

40:37.287 --> 40:40.500
Oh, that's alright, Henrietta, please ...
No, no, don't, no, please, Henrietta.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.750
Is there any cold water?

40:41.792 --> 40:43.800
No, no, never mind.
Please sit down, Henrietta.

40:43.961 --> 40:49.425
Henrietta, please. Nonsense. Nonsense.
The floor needed a touch of color.

40:52.553 --> 40:56.306
Henry, I'm so stupid and clumsy and gauche.

40:56.515 --> 40:58.726
I don't know what to say.
I've ruined another carpet.

40:58.767 --> 41:02.100
No, Henrietta, please. Stop that. Can you
possibly believe, for one moment ...

41:02.400 --> 41:05.983
that what happens to this foolish, hairy
floor covering matters to me ...

41:06.025 --> 41:08.193
when I have you sitting beside me?

41:09.111 --> 41:12.072
looking at me with your beautifully soft ...

41:12.197 --> 41:16.702
yet highly intelligent, well-informed eyes?

41:16.827 --> 41:19.038
Talking to me in your gentle ...

41:19.204 --> 41:22.958
yet perfectly modulated,
podium-trained voice?

41:24.835 --> 41:27.254
You must think me very superficial.

41:27.338 --> 41:29.173
Oh, no. I don't.

41:30.007 --> 41:37.798
Henrietta, er ... er ...
would you care for some more wine?

41:38.107 --> 41:39.692
Oh yes, I would love some.

41:40.603 --> 41:43.939
Henrietta ... Henrietta ...

41:44.414 --> 41:46.281
I have something to ask you.

41:48.275 --> 41:53.822
I ... I ... erm ...
What time is it?

41:57.368 --> 42:01.914
It's ... erm ... it's, oh, it's 10 o'clock
and then we have to leave pretty soon ...

42:01.955 --> 42:04.174
'cause I have to get up tomorrow
very early for a class.

42:11.382 --> 42:14.093
- Ooh!
- Pardon? Something wrong?

42:14.218 --> 42:17.012
- Henry? Henry?
- Oh. No, no.

42:17.221 --> 42:19.264
Henrietta ...

42:20.182 --> 42:24.395
Henrietta, we have a great deal
in common, you and I.

42:24.436 --> 42:27.523
We are both of the same division:
vertebrata ...

42:27.940 --> 42:29.274
the same class: mammalia ...

42:29.650 --> 42:31.068
the same order: primate ...

42:31.360 --> 42:32.820
the same family: hominide

42:32.903 --> 42:34.279
the same genus: homo ...

42:34.321 --> 42:36.281
the same species: sapiens ...

42:36.490 --> 42:37.991
and the same variety of a class.

42:38.450 --> 42:41.620
- I don't think there's a class of variety ...
- Keep quiet, Henr-!

42:41.829 --> 42:44.998
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I ...

42:45.040 --> 42:47.793
Where ... where was I? I ... Oh, yes ...

42:47.835 --> 42:51.171
In fact the only difference between us
is that I am a man and you are a woman.

42:51.213 --> 42:54.258
And we don't have to let that interfere
if we are reasonably careful.

42:57.542 --> 42:58.542
Y-yes.

42:59.346 --> 43:01.515
Henrietta, what I'm trying to say is ...

43:10.357 --> 43:11.291
Will you marry me?

43:11.400 --> 43:12.484
I beg your pardon?

43:18.365 --> 43:20.534
Oh, Henrietta, if you care for me at all.

43:20.576 --> 43:22.286
Even if you don't care for me at all ...

43:22.494 --> 43:25.914
but feel that you could ... learn to care
for me at all ...

43:25.956 --> 43:28.250
in a reasonable amount of time,
please say yes.

43:28.459 --> 43:31.253
There is often a tidy
profit in speculation.

43:31.503 --> 43:33.339
I care for you, Henry.
I do care for you.

43:33.672 --> 43:36.633
Oh! Henrietta.
Ahhhhh! Dammit to hell!

43:36.675 --> 43:38.260
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No, no.

43:38.302 --> 43:40.637
Kneeling on broken glass
is my favorite pastime.

43:40.721 --> 43:42.014
It keeps me from slouching.

43:42.056 --> 43:43.057
Do you think you should get up, Henry?

43:43.098 --> 43:44.892
No. Never. Not until I finish.

43:44.933 --> 43:47.144
I would kneel on anything
for you, Henrietta.

43:47.186 --> 43:50.564
Henrietta, if you turn me down,
it would be the end of me.

43:50.647 --> 43:52.358
I would literally ... have nothing.

43:53.275 --> 43:55.700
- There would be such a ...
- I won't ... I wouldn't.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.613
I'm not going to turn you down, Henry.

43:57.780 --> 43:59.573
- You're not?
- No.

44:00.282 --> 44:02.159
I love you, Henry.

44:03.952 --> 44:05.371
That was my dream, Henry.

44:05.454 --> 44:09.541
From the moment that you spilled your tea
on Gloria Cunliffe's Aubusson.

44:10.042 --> 44:12.300
That someday you would ask me
to marry you.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.700
That was most of my dream.

44:14.713 --> 44:17.633
Henrietta, darling, would this
Saturday be too soon?

44:17.800 --> 44:20.010
- This Saturday?
- Yes.

44:20.073 --> 44:24.173
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday ...
Oh, heavens, mercy!

44:24.223 --> 44:25.641
Answer yes or no!

44:25.683 --> 44:29.103
- Henrietta, I'm intensely uncomfortable.
- Yes, yes, yes!

44:29.436 --> 44:32.231
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

44:35.317 --> 44:43.742
Here. You're a good girl.
You're a good ... a good girl.

44:48.163 --> 44:52.751
- Oh, heavens, I mean, mercy ... gracious heavens.
- Stay with heavens.

44:53.127 --> 44:55.546
Ouch! Stop that, Harold!

44:55.587 --> 44:57.381
I'm sorry, sir.

44:58.257 --> 44:59.466
That hurts.

45:00.843 --> 45:04.430
I'm saved, Harold.
Less hurried but saved.

45:04.763 --> 45:06.890
I'm enormously pleased, sir.

45:07.766 --> 45:10.227
Oh, I wish you could've been there, Harold.
I wish you could have been there.

45:10.269 --> 45:14.398
I was brilliant. Brilliant! You would have
been astonished of my technique.

45:14.481 --> 45:16.191
Sir, I don't doubt you, sir.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.236
Harold, send an announcement
out to the newspapers ...

45:19.319 --> 45:22.072
and put Ms Lowell's attorney
on the guest list.

45:22.156 --> 45:26.118
It seems he's a close
personal friend of hers.

45:26.201 --> 45:28.746
Has the wine come up off the rug yet?

45:28.787 --> 45:30.998
No sir. I'm soaking it now
in various solvents ...

45:31.040 --> 45:32.666
but they only seem to dissolve the nap.

45:32.708 --> 45:34.293
I oughta sue her.

45:34.543 --> 45:37.963
Do you know how many llamas
must have died to make that rug?

45:39.214 --> 45:43.177
Have my travel agent book a cottage
somewhere for a few days.

45:43.218 --> 45:46.200
I'll have to pick up the $50,000
during the honeymoon.

45:46.347 --> 45:50.267
Oh, sir. Isn't that just a trifle unseemly?

45:50.309 --> 45:52.019
Unseemly? Unseemly!?

45:52.519 --> 45:56.148
Harold, after her behavior tonight,
anything I do will be seemly.

45:56.357 --> 45:58.192
Never have I seen one woman ...

45:58.400 --> 46:02.029
in whom every social grace was so lacking.

46:02.071 --> 46:04.948
Did I say she was primitive?
I retract that. She's feral.

46:05.491 --> 46:08.285
I've never spent a more physically
destructive evening in my life.

46:08.327 --> 46:10.287
I am nauseated. I limp.

46:10.329 --> 46:13.499
And I can feel my teeth rotting
away from an excess of sugar ...

46:13.540 --> 46:15.793
that no amount of toothpaste can dislodge.

46:15.834 --> 46:18.712
I will taste those damn
Malaga coolers forever.

46:18.796 --> 46:20.964
That woman is a menace
not only to health ...

46:21.006 --> 46:23.217
but to Western civilization as we know it.

46:23.258 --> 46:25.052
She doesn't deserve to live.

46:27.388 --> 46:28.555
Forget I said that.

46:31.016 --> 46:31.892
Yes.

46:36.105 --> 46:36.980
He did it.

46:37.481 --> 46:40.359
He did it. Oh, get off my lap,
you little ingrate! Get off!

46:44.655 --> 46:48.575
He did it. He really, really did it.

46:49.910 --> 46:53.372
Yes, yes. I know who
Henrietta Lowell's attorney is.

46:54.081 --> 46:56.500
In fact, he has an office
somewhere in this building.

46:58.043 --> 47:00.004
Well, let's put it this way, Harry.

47:00.045 --> 47:02.881
He doesn't seem to have a very
active practice.

47:03.048 --> 47:05.759
Henrietta Lowell seems to be
his only client.

47:06.602 --> 47:07.687
Well, what I mean is ...

47:08.070 --> 47:10.364
he may not be exactly overjoyed ...

47:10.606 --> 47:13.692
at the idea of sharing her
affections with Henry.

47:13.934 --> 47:17.646
- No! No, no, no! No ...
- Andrew.

47:18.105 --> 47:21.275
No, I won't accept it.
As your lawyer, I forbid it.

47:21.358 --> 47:22.609
But Andrew, I'm in love.

47:22.651 --> 47:25.112
Nonsense. After three days?

47:25.487 --> 47:27.740
Who is he? One of your students?

47:28.115 --> 47:31.368
That little wino who went with you on one
of your field trips to the Canary Islands?

47:31.410 --> 47:33.287
Malcolm Finger is not a wino, Andrew.

47:33.328 --> 47:34.079
But it is him?

47:34.121 --> 47:35.289
- No, it is not.
- Well then, who is it?

47:35.706 --> 47:36.874
A foreigner?

47:36.915 --> 47:39.084
Some little wop with a fancy title?

47:39.918 --> 47:42.463
What's the little
fortune hunter's name?

47:42.880 --> 47:43.964
Really, Andrew.

47:44.006 --> 47:45.716
I don't see why you take it for granted ...

47:45.799 --> 47:48.385
that the only reason that somebody
would marry me is for my money.

47:48.427 --> 47:50.971
There may be some other basis, you know?

47:52.181 --> 47:56.518
Oh my God. Oh my God. Of course, Henrietta.
Don't you think that I know?

47:56.852 --> 48:00.606
Haven't I proposed to you these past ten
years on whatever other basis there is?

48:00.647 --> 48:03.609
Look, it's ... it's just that ... with
your discreet beauty ...

48:03.817 --> 48:05.152
and womanly presence ...

48:05.235 --> 48:07.112
I find it deeply suspicious for anyone ...

48:07.279 --> 48:08.614
who claims to ...

48:08.655 --> 48:09.990
penetrate the many mysteries ...

48:10.032 --> 48:12.826
of your personality in just three days.

48:12.910 --> 48:14.828
You're saying that I'm plain and shy ...

48:14.870 --> 48:17.122
but that after a while you get used to it.

48:17.373 --> 48:22.711
I'm saying that you're not flagrant.
I'm saying that you're subtle.

48:22.920 --> 48:29.176
Like some very expensive ...
custom-made ... hat.

48:30.636 --> 48:34.223
I don't know what I'm saying.
Can't you see that I'm distraught?

48:36.016 --> 48:40.938
Andrew. Andrew, listen to me.
You will find ... You will find someone else.

48:41.021 --> 48:44.566
Andrew, you will find some wonderful
woman who deserves you.

48:45.651 --> 48:50.197
Are you alright, Andrew?
Andrew, oh, please. What's wrong?

48:50.364 --> 48:51.865
Nothing, Henrietta. Nothing.

48:55.244 --> 48:57.997
- Henrietta, darling ...
- No, no! Andrew! No more ...

49:00.958 --> 49:04.670
Andrew, I'm going now. I'm leaving,
in order to meet Henry ...

49:04.712 --> 49:08.382
who, it just so happens, is an
American citizen of English extraction ...

49:08.424 --> 49:10.676
with a very large fortune of his own.

49:11.927 --> 49:13.262
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

49:14.972 --> 49:17.808
- What's Henry's last name?
- Graham.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.937
Oh, Andrew, please.
Please come to the wedding.

49:22.104 --> 49:25.919
I'll be so disappointed if you
don't give me away. Please?

49:26.131 --> 49:28.331
- Please?
- Alright, alright.

49:37.578 --> 49:43.250
Henry Graham.
You won't get away with it, Henry Graham.

49:43.459 --> 49:48.297
Won't will not get away with it!
Let me see. Now, I have to do something.

49:48.589 --> 49:51.967
Who do I know who's pregnant
and a good sport?

49:56.638 --> 50:00.476
- Yes, Mariamne?
<i>- A Mr Harry Graham is on 21, sir.</i>

50:00.726 --> 50:03.645
<i>He says it's extremely urgent
and confidential.</i>

50:03.937 --> 50:05.397
- Harry Graham?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

50:05.939 --> 50:07.191
Very well, put him on.

50:08.233 --> 50:10.527
Little ninny, doesn't even
know his right name.

50:13.697 --> 50:15.282
Mr Graham.

50:16.450 --> 50:18.577
You wonder why I called you here today.

50:18.702 --> 50:22.539
One day before the ceremony that
will unite you as man and wife.

50:22.665 --> 50:24.333
Let me explain.

50:24.458 --> 50:28.761
As Henrietta's friend and attorney,
it behooves me ...

50:28.770 --> 50:31.882
... to take on the ever unpleasant
role of the devil's advocate.

50:31.924 --> 50:35.427
And despite her assurances
that you are a man of means ...

50:35.803 --> 50:39.807
I've taken it upon myself to
investigate your financial status.

50:43.811 --> 50:47.648
Excuse me, sir.
Tea will be delayed by 7 minutes.

50:49.108 --> 50:51.193
- Andrew, you had no right to do that.
- Alright.

50:51.235 --> 50:54.613
It's quite alright, Henrietta.
I have nothing to hide.

50:54.655 --> 50:57.991
The Grahams have been with
the same bank for six generations ...

50:58.033 --> 51:00.244
as Mr McPherson has
undoubtedly discovered.

51:00.452 --> 51:02.413
I didn't speak to the bank, Mr Graham.

51:02.997 --> 51:04.540
I spoke to your uncle.

51:07.167 --> 51:09.211
Your butler seems to have weak wrists.

51:09.628 --> 51:12.589
Andrew, I think it's just dreadful
of you to do that.

51:12.631 --> 51:14.383
To call Henry's uncle
and speak to him ...

51:14.591 --> 51:17.469
as if he were opening up
some kind of charge account.

51:17.511 --> 51:18.846
I'm so sorry, Henry.

51:18.887 --> 51:23.100
Henrietta, I didn't call Henry's uncle.
Henry's uncle called me ...

51:23.434 --> 51:25.894
in order to tell me that
his nephew here ...

51:25.936 --> 51:29.648
borrowed $50,000 from him
five and a half weeks ago ...

51:29.940 --> 51:31.275
because his trust fund ran out ...

51:31.316 --> 51:33.110
and he had to pay some back bills ...

51:33.402 --> 51:37.072
and marry a wealthy woman before
the news of it got around.

51:37.114 --> 51:41.660
I hope you can substantiate this hearsay,
because I intend to sue you for slander.

51:41.910 --> 51:45.456
Oh, I can substantiate it alright.
I wouldn't be here if I couldn't.

51:49.335 --> 51:53.172
Henrietta, here's a photostat
of the original note.

51:53.714 --> 51:55.382
Now take a good look at it.

52:01.096 --> 52:02.973
They're rather interesting
terms, aren't they?

52:03.015 --> 52:05.184
You're still gonna sue me
for slander, Mr Graham?

52:05.392 --> 52:09.188
Yes, Mr McPherson. I am still
going to sue you for slander.

52:23.869 --> 52:27.456
You see, McPherson,
I knew for several years ...

52:27.665 --> 52:29.249
that my money was running out.

52:29.291 --> 52:31.919
Now, if you can convince a court ...

52:32.169 --> 52:35.130
that any man with the
slightest interest at all in money ...

52:35.172 --> 52:38.092
would sit around for several years
doing nothing ...

52:38.133 --> 52:39.843
while his money ran out ...

52:40.094 --> 52:45.474
and then borrow $50,000 under the most
disadvantageous terms imaginable ...

52:45.516 --> 52:50.145
so that he could dash out and
catch himself a rich wife ...

52:50.187 --> 52:53.440
in order to pay it back
within six weeks ...

52:53.482 --> 52:57.945
I will withdraw my suit for slander.

52:58.612 --> 52:59.738
Alright.

53:05.077 --> 53:07.037
Now, let's put in this way, Graham.

53:12.626 --> 53:15.212
Now, let's put in this way, Graham.

53:16.338 --> 53:18.632
If you can convince a court ...

53:18.674 --> 53:23.178
that any man without any interest at all
whatsoever in money of any kind ...

53:23.262 --> 53:26.765
would borrow $50,000
for no reason at all ...

53:26.807 --> 53:29.268
I'll withdraw my charge.

53:29.893 --> 53:31.061
Agreed.

53:35.691 --> 53:37.234
Alright. Let's hear the reason.

53:37.317 --> 53:42.656
Now, you were going to use the $50,000
to set up a fund for the disadvantaged ...

53:42.698 --> 53:45.659
and make a better world.
Am I close?

53:46.100 --> 53:48.867
No sense in being facetious,
Mr McPherson.

53:50.039 --> 53:53.667
I was going to use the $50,000
to tidy up my affairs ...

53:54.793 --> 53:56.587
and then immediately afterwards ...

53:57.796 --> 53:59.006
kill myself.

54:02.509 --> 54:05.262
Yes, Henrietta. On the day I met you
I was a dead man.

54:05.346 --> 54:07.890
My life was over. And then ...

54:09.224 --> 54:10.517
something happened to me.

54:10.893 --> 54:13.520
I suddenly realized that if ...

54:13.937 --> 54:16.398
by some miracle I could have you ...

54:16.440 --> 54:21.111
I would have a purpose, an answer
to the emptiness of my existence.

54:21.528 --> 54:24.323
And so I proposed, Henrietta.
Not to get your money ...

54:24.365 --> 54:28.160
but to find out
if I had a reason to live.

54:29.328 --> 54:31.622
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

54:32.039 --> 54:35.250
I would have married you
the very first day.

54:39.880 --> 54:44.551
Henrietta, wait a minute!
You don't believe that garbage, do you?

54:44.635 --> 54:48.263
Any sex-starved half-wit would know that's
just a line. What's the matter with you?

54:48.305 --> 54:50.808
You have been unbelievably cruel.

54:50.849 --> 54:53.018
Thank you for keeping me alive, Henrietta.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.938
You're welcome, Henry.
You're entirely welcome.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.065
I can't believe this!

54:59.400 --> 55:02.105
- Get off.
- I beg of you, Henrietta ... Sorry ...

55:02.528 --> 55:05.850
I beg of you, Henrietta. Don't get
carried away. Henrietta ...

55:06.073 --> 55:08.909
If he's not really interested in
your money, make him prove it!

55:09.034 --> 55:12.121
I would do anything in the world
to prove to you, Henrietta ...

55:12.204 --> 55:14.915
that I haven't the slightest interest
at all in your money ...

55:14.957 --> 55:17.126
but there is absolutely no way I can do it.

55:17.167 --> 55:19.400
- There is no way.
- I have a way.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.547
- But there is no way.
- Henrietta, I have a way.

55:22.548 --> 55:25.050
Have him consent to some kind of
legal arrangement ...

55:25.092 --> 55:27.886
that prevents him from gaining
financially after the marriage.

55:27.928 --> 55:28.846
Don't listen to him, Henrietta.

55:28.887 --> 55:32.516
That way, people won't get the wrong
impression from his uncle the way I did.

55:32.558 --> 55:33.809
That's a good idea.

55:35.019 --> 55:39.481
Let's make all my accounts
joint with Henry.

55:39.523 --> 55:42.109
And he's to have a checkbook
with his name on it.

55:42.151 --> 55:45.112
And I would like the debt to his uncle
paid before the wedding.

55:45.154 --> 55:49.158
You would like ... you would ...
Are you crazy?

55:49.283 --> 55:50.868
Have you gone totally out of your mind?

55:50.909 --> 55:52.745
- I thought it was your idea.
- It was not my idea!

55:53.203 --> 55:56.248
My idea was for him to disclaim
all your money, not to share it.

55:56.290 --> 55:59.501
Oh, that's really just ridiculous, Andrew.
It's very naive of you.

55:59.668 --> 56:04.256
If Henry disclaimed all my money, I would
have to write all of his checks for him.

56:04.548 --> 56:06.216
And then people really would think ...

56:06.300 --> 56:07.843
that he was marrying me for my money.

56:07.968 --> 56:12.056
Don't you see?
This way he'll already have all my money.

56:12.181 --> 56:15.434
So that no one can possibly think
that he's married me for it.

56:15.684 --> 56:17.269
Don't you think it's a good solution,
Henry?

56:17.311 --> 56:20.206
You nincompoop!
That's no solution at all.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.492
- Henrietta, I love you.
- How dare you call my fiancee a nincompoop?

56:23.800 --> 56:27.321
Harold! Get Mr McPherson's hat
and show him out.

56:27.363 --> 56:28.708
- Hat ?
- Yes.

56:28.768 --> 56:31.835
We have to get to the bank
before it closes at 3 o'clock.

56:38.633 --> 56:40.633
<i>Nein, nein, nein.
Nein, nein.</i>

56:45.089 --> 56:48.842
- I thought you were going to play the Bach.
- This is what he told me to play.

56:49.968 --> 56:54.890
Harold, you've got to stop her.
That little woman. She's touching things.

56:55.391 --> 56:59.436
Oh no. She's ... Harold, she's
unscrewing my Montrosini.

56:59.478 --> 57:02.815
You don't have time to make a fuss now, sir.
I'll screw it back when she leaves.

57:02.856 --> 57:04.692
She's destroying my living room.

57:04.858 --> 57:06.360
Why did I get into this?

57:06.402 --> 57:09.655
I don't even know her, she's a stranger.
I don't want her here.

57:10.989 --> 57:12.032
Get out!

57:12.074 --> 57:14.118
Oh, I thought this was the bathroom.

57:14.159 --> 57:15.369
Well, it's not!

57:15.411 --> 57:17.746
And if you touch anything else,
I'll have you arrested.

57:17.871 --> 57:19.540
Oh, sir, get a hold of yourself.

57:19.623 --> 57:21.875
This is what it'll be like,
isn't it, Harold?

57:22.042 --> 57:24.378
She'll be everywhere, touching things.

57:24.461 --> 57:26.672
Poking her nose into
where it doesn't belong ...

57:26.714 --> 57:28.632
pretending she's looking for the bathroom.

57:28.674 --> 57:30.551
No, sir. You will share things.

57:30.592 --> 57:33.744
I don't want to share things.
I want to own them all by myself.

57:33.804 --> 57:36.098
Why are you standing there,
you little spy?

57:36.140 --> 57:39.393
McPherson sent you in here
to find out what was going on?

57:39.435 --> 57:40.352
Oh, sir.

57:40.477 --> 57:42.896
- Is he the groom?
- Don't answer that, Harold.

57:44.815 --> 57:47.276
I'll ask the questions from here on in.

57:48.569 --> 57:51.238
Henrietta, if I could just talk to you ...

57:53.866 --> 57:55.325
Who are you really?

57:55.743 --> 57:56.827
Come on now, let's have it!

57:56.910 --> 57:58.954
And I want real names
or else you'll regret it.

57:58.996 --> 58:01.707
I'm Dodi Heinrich.
Professor Heinrich's daughter.

58:01.999 --> 58:03.250
Professor Heinrich?

58:03.292 --> 58:06.295
Harold, he's invited
some Nazi to the wedding.

58:06.378 --> 58:10.215
Sir, you are hysterical. You must get hold.
You are due at the altar now.

58:10.257 --> 58:11.925
I won't move until she leaves.

58:11.967 --> 58:13.552
I will not get dressed
in front of a woman ...

58:13.594 --> 58:15.262
and she might as well understand that now.

58:15.346 --> 58:16.889
You already are dressed.

58:18.682 --> 58:20.684
Get her out. Out!

58:22.311 --> 58:25.564
- Miss Heinrich, I will escort you to the bathroom.
- Get out! Out!

58:31.236 --> 58:34.448
And she will not touch my things.
I will not have her touching my things.

58:36.575 --> 58:38.410
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

58:46.126 --> 58:49.546
Come on. It's time.
What are you doing up there?

59:03.769 --> 59:06.647
Frank, I think one of my legs is
shorter than the other.

59:06.689 --> 59:07.748
Yes, I know, old man. It'll get ...

59:07.731 --> 59:09.967
longer again after the ceremony.

59:17.991 --> 59:20.077
Oh, I'll kill her.

59:54.743 --> 59:57.376
Henrietta, it's not too late.

59:58.237 --> 59:59.704
I love you, Henrietta.

01:00:00.273 --> 01:00:02.540
Please don't do this insane thing.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.760
Oh, Henrietta, I just talked to his uncle ...

01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:07.873
I'll kill myself, Henrietta ...

01:00:12.868 --> 01:00:17.601
Would you step back just half a step,
so Henry can stand next to Henrietta?

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.381
Dearly beloved.

01:00:23.591 --> 01:00:25.968
We are gathered together here
in the sight of God ...

01:00:26.177 --> 01:00:27.803
and in the face of this company ...

01:00:28.596 --> 01:00:32.016
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony ...

01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:37.090
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God ...

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.233
signifying unto us the mystical union
which is betwixt Christ and his church ...

01:01:24.276 --> 01:01:26.437
- I'll be leaving now.
I hope you'll enjoy your stay.

01:01:26.477 --> 01:01:27.877
Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:28.572 --> 01:01:33.786
Erm, Henrietta, I will use this chest
and you can use that one.

01:01:33.828 --> 01:01:36.497
Or would you prefer that I use
that chest and you use this one?

01:01:37.248 --> 01:01:39.166
That one will be fine.

01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:40.751
And I will unpack my own things.

01:01:40.793 --> 01:01:42.503
I have a certain way
that I unpack my things.

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.672
And if anyone touches anything
I get mixed up.

01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:47.758
- Yes, Henry.
- Alright. Then shall we unpack?

01:01:50.136 --> 01:01:52.179
I'm just going to dig up this specimen ...

01:01:52.263 --> 01:01:54.598
and take it home for classification.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.351
It's probably been classified for years ...

01:01:57.393 --> 01:01:59.770
but I might as well just try it anyway.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:00.646
Why not?

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.108
This is really incredible.

01:02:04.442 --> 01:02:06.402
I know this isn't a Cyathea.

01:02:06.485 --> 01:02:08.195
I know it's an Alsophila but ...

01:02:08.237 --> 01:02:12.825
it seems to have some kind of
vestigial indusium.

01:02:20.071 --> 01:02:21.071
Whoops!

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:26.630
Henry?

01:02:37.516 --> 01:02:41.645
Commonly found in gardening sheds.

01:02:42.605 --> 01:02:43.731
Perfect.

01:02:44.023 --> 01:02:48.486
Spreading and emulsifying agents.

01:02:49.904 --> 01:02:52.031
Soap, saponins, gelatin ...

01:02:53.199 --> 01:02:57.203
Sticking agents, defloculating agents ...

01:02:58.746 --> 01:03:02.625
Get poison from gardening shed.

01:03:07.838 --> 01:03:16.013
Toxides: arsenic acid, sodium arsenite,
boron compounds, cyanides ...

01:03:17.264 --> 01:03:20.309
cyo-cyenates and
related compounds ...

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:29.837
Oh, Henrietta, I meant to ask you ...

01:04:30.296 --> 01:04:33.340
which, er ... which bed do you prefer ?

01:04:33.507 --> 01:04:35.968
This one or that one?
Either one is fine for me.

01:04:39.138 --> 01:04:40.639
This one is fine.

01:04:40.723 --> 01:04:42.558
Fine. Then I will take that one.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.436
And when we both use the same
bed, we'll use this one.

01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:49.982
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

01:05:05.623 --> 01:05:08.417
Henrietta, where is your other arm?

01:05:09.377 --> 01:05:10.920
It's in the nightgown.

01:05:11.003 --> 01:05:13.214
It's a Graecian-style nightgown.

01:05:13.422 --> 01:05:17.760
It fits over one shoulder and
the other one goes inside.

01:05:18.094 --> 01:05:21.263
It's very uncomfortable. I can barely
move my head all the way around.

01:05:21.347 --> 01:05:26.268
Fine ... I just think you have
your head through the arm-hole.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.813
If you'll just stand up for a minute.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.100
That's it. There you are ...

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.874
I think ... You see, you have
your head through the arm-hole.

01:05:38.103 --> 01:05:40.170
Now, pick your arm up ...

01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:44.995
No, not that one.
Put that one down.

01:05:45.287 --> 01:05:49.274
That arm down. Let's pick
this arm up. Thaaaat's it.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.585
That's it.

01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:53.879
Now, here we are.

01:05:54.255 --> 01:05:58.676
- Just get this ... over here ...
- Let me put my glasses ...

01:05:58.718 --> 01:06:02.096
Oh, here. Let me put
your glasses down here.

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:08.337
Alright. Now, hold it ...

01:06:08.769 --> 01:06:09.979
No, just a minute.

01:06:13.024 --> 01:06:16.193
See, you have your ...
you have your head through the arm-hole.

01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:20.239
We have to get your head out ...
out of the arm-hole.

01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:22.575
See, both of the holes look very similar.

01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:24.994
Where ... where is your head-hole?

01:06:27.538 --> 01:06:29.582
Well, I thought my head was in it.

01:06:29.623 --> 01:06:32.126
No. You had your head in the arm-hole.

01:06:32.209 --> 01:06:33.753
Where are you now?

01:06:33.794 --> 01:06:35.254
I'm still where I was.

01:06:35.296 --> 01:06:38.049
- Where ...?
- Just a minute.

01:06:38.716 --> 01:06:41.927
Oh. Here. That's it.

01:06:41.969 --> 01:06:43.262
Here you are.

01:06:43.345 --> 01:06:45.598
- I'll get your arm ...
- This arm?

01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:50.644
Yes. Get this arm through ... through ...
No, wait a minute. You have ...

01:06:53.564 --> 01:06:55.149
There. That's it.

01:06:55.358 --> 01:06:56.484
Now put this arm ...

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.111
through here.

01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:03.449
This is a head-and-left-arm hole.

01:07:04.784 --> 01:07:07.370
Here. There you are.

01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:10.689
- That's it. That's it!
- Oh, I see.

01:07:10.915 --> 01:07:17.171
Now, there! That's the way ... it's
supposed to ... It still looks strange.

01:07:17.588 --> 01:07:20.633
I'm sorry to be so much trouble to you.

01:07:20.716 --> 01:07:22.343
That's alright. It's not for long ...

01:07:27.973 --> 01:07:31.102
- Harold, Harold!
- Welcome home.

01:07:31.143 --> 01:07:32.770
- Where is Mrs Graham, sir?
- Who?

01:07:32.812 --> 01:07:34.772
Is she not with you, sir?
Where is she, sir?

01:07:34.855 --> 01:07:35.773
Hello.

01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:39.151
Oh, there you are, Madam.
Oh, welcome home, Mrs Graham.

01:07:39.193 --> 01:07:42.321
May ... may I express my great
joy at seeing you ... again.

01:07:42.947 --> 01:07:44.824
Thank you, Harold. Heavens.

01:07:45.533 --> 01:07:47.368
Harold, where is the chauffeur?

01:07:48.494 --> 01:07:49.620
I couldn't find him, sir.

01:07:49.704 --> 01:07:51.414
He disappeared just as
I was about to leave.

01:07:51.455 --> 01:07:52.873
- Couldn't find him ?
- No.

01:07:52.957 --> 01:07:54.834
John is a little forgetful, dear.

01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:56.919
That's why I usually take the bus.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.964
- Who's John?
- John is the chauffeur.

01:08:00.131 --> 01:08:01.507
His memory lapses.

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:03.634
I ... I think you ought to
prepare yourself, sir.

01:08:03.676 --> 01:08:06.470
Mrs Graham's household is
incredibly democratic.

01:08:08.108 --> 01:08:09.908
Couldn't find the chauffeur?

01:08:21.777 --> 01:08:24.822
Chauffeur? Chauffeur!

01:08:24.863 --> 01:08:26.745
Well, you're early.

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:31.536
Well, welcome home and
congratulations.

01:08:32.496 --> 01:08:37.167
Mrs Traggert, I'd like you to meet
my husband, Henry Graham.

01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:38.018
How do you do?

01:08:38.044 --> 01:08:42.006
Henry, this is the housekeeper,
our housekeeper, Mrs Traggert.

01:08:42.256 --> 01:08:44.216
May I ask where the chauffeur is?

01:08:45.134 --> 01:08:48.220
Well, didn't he pick you up at the airport?

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:49.596
No, he did not.

01:08:50.014 --> 01:08:52.015
Oh, well ...

01:08:52.058 --> 01:08:57.270
I guess, er, his car broke down.
I'll have to look into that.

01:08:58.147 --> 01:09:01.108
Will you ... you're wanting dinner
at home this evening?

01:09:01.692 --> 01:09:04.737
Henry, would you want dinner
at home this evening?

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:06.654
Yes, supper for two, Mrs Traggert.

01:09:07.448 --> 01:09:08.741
Very good.

01:09:11.535 --> 01:09:13.120
Thank you, Mrs Traggert.

01:09:13.203 --> 01:09:14.412
You're welcome.

01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:22.546
- Well, how do you like it so far, dear?
- Well, I've only seen the foyer.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:26.591
Oh, well, this is the main hall.

01:09:35.477 --> 01:09:39.777
Oh, baby. Oh, I need you.
Oh, I want you. Aah ... ooh ...

01:09:42.024 --> 01:09:45.336
Oh, who ... who are they?

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:51.701
Erm, one of them was a maid and
the other ... er ... was the chauffeur.

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.537
- John, the chauffeur?
- Yes.

01:09:55.746 --> 01:09:58.332
Tell me, Henrietta, on what basis
do you hire your servants?

01:09:58.416 --> 01:10:00.626
Efficiency or personal charm?

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:04.922
Both, actually. I mean,
I don't actually hire them.

01:10:05.047 --> 01:10:09.516
Mrs Traggert does now
 do the hiring, but I, er ...

01:10:10.793 --> 01:10:15.226
When I did hire them,
I used both criteria.

01:10:15.281 --> 01:10:16.281
Oh, er, madam?

01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:19.391
Are you a guest in ...?
Is she ...?

01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:25.654
Madam, would you mind using
the servants' staircase?

01:10:25.741 --> 01:10:27.241
This is Mrs Blair.

01:10:27.403 --> 01:10:28.903
This is the cook's daughter, Mandy.

01:10:43.085 --> 01:10:47.089
Er, Madam, would you mind
letting us through? We ... Harold!

01:10:48.038 --> 01:10:49.038
<i>- Harold?</i>
- Yes, sir?

01:10:49.425 --> 01:10:53.304
Harold, get the household accounts
from Mrs Traggert immediately ...

01:10:53.471 --> 01:10:54.972
and meet me in the
drawing room in ten minutes.

01:10:55.056 --> 01:10:56.348
You can finish the luggage later.

01:10:57.391 --> 01:11:00.568
- You may go now, Harold.
- Yes.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.274
This is insane. Absolutely astonishing.

01:11:05.358 --> 01:11:07.943
I thought it might be, sir.
She keeps it under the mattress.

01:11:09.737 --> 01:11:11.155
Hm. Look at this, Harold.

01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:16.243
There are 17 servants in this house,
including a cook's daughter ...

01:11:16.285 --> 01:11:20.247
who gets $200 a week
as her mother's helper.

01:11:22.249 --> 01:11:25.920
The food bills average out to $130 a day.

01:11:27.088 --> 01:11:28.381
And there are no receipts.

01:11:29.965 --> 01:11:34.345
Miscellaneous: $6,000 a month.

01:11:35.596 --> 01:11:36.972
Harold, after dinner ...

01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:38.682
I want all the servants in this room ...

01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:41.811
and be sure that Mrs Graham
is not present.

01:11:42.144 --> 01:11:44.772
Copy this ledger exactly and put it
back under the mattress.

01:11:44.814 --> 01:11:45.856
Certainly, sir.

01:11:46.649 --> 01:11:50.486
Harold, do you happen to know
where the gardening shed is?

01:11:50.528 --> 01:11:52.196
Yes, sir. It's in the back of the garden.

01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:57.868
Oh, good. Well, I guess I'll take
a stroll around the grounds.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.496
We don't have anything like that,
Mr Graham.

01:12:00.538 --> 01:12:01.997
Mrs Graham wouldn't allow it.

01:12:02.039 --> 01:12:04.792
She's a strict believer
in the organic method.

01:12:05.126 --> 01:12:09.141
But surely some of the
more basic pesticides ...

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:12.558
arsenic, strychnine ... that kind of thing.

01:12:12.683 --> 01:12:16.554
No. A healthy plant in a healthy soil.

01:12:16.595 --> 01:12:17.930
That's the organic method.

01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:19.974
It works, too.

01:12:20.182 --> 01:12:21.726
Oh, really?

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.114
Well ... if it really works,
why change it?

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.919
Mr Graham, on behalf of the entire staff,
I would like to welcome you aboard ...

01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:51.271
and drink a toast to your success.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.800
Thank you very much, Mrs Traggert.
No, thank you.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.300
No, thank you very much.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.500
Mrs Traggert ...

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.800
No, thank you.

01:13:05.978 --> 01:13:08.314
I would like to say a word,
please, Mrs Traggert?

01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:10.807
There's something about you
that puzzles me.

01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:15.037
Why do you continue on in the arduous
position of housekeeper ...

01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:17.081
when by investing wisely you could have ...

01:13:17.122 --> 01:13:19.917
your own little townhouse
in Sutton Place?

01:13:23.871 --> 01:13:26.165
And a guaranteed income for life.

01:13:28.459 --> 01:13:31.170
Surely, after having
successfully managed ...

01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:33.381
to head the household accounts ...

01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:38.177
to the tune of 35,000 tax-free dollars
per year, for the past five years ...

01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:39.929
you must have salted something away.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.425
Have I ever.

01:13:42.473 --> 01:13:43.849
I'm not including, of course ...

01:13:43.974 --> 01:13:46.143
the token salary of $800 a week

01:13:46.394 --> 01:13:47.937
- Four ... four hundred.
- Oh.

01:13:48.896 --> 01:13:50.606
you receive as mad money.

01:13:50.883 --> 01:13:51.883
Huh, is it mad?

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.824
Mrs Traggert, you're fired.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:04.912
I don't understand.
I don't know what that means.

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:07.281
It means that you are a thief, Mrs Traggert.

01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:11.252
On what grounds are you
making this accusation?

01:14:11.293 --> 01:14:13.045
I'm calling you a thief ...

01:14:13.087 --> 01:14:15.673
on the basis of the household accounts ...

01:14:15.715 --> 01:14:18.008
which you very sensibly
hid under your mattress.

01:14:19.552 --> 01:14:23.639
Listen, Mr Graham, could I speak to you
for just one little minute, please?

01:14:24.056 --> 01:14:27.017
The time is now 7 minutes past 9 o'clock.

01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:29.729
If you are not out of this house
by 10, I will call the police.

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:32.440
Shall we synchronize our watches
or would you rather go for broke?

01:14:32.481 --> 01:14:36.652
Uh, eh ... You, er, you wouldn't like
to hear my side of the story?

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.242
Alright, alright! I'm leaving.

01:14:46.954 --> 01:14:49.373
- Oh, John.
- Yes, sir?

01:14:49.415 --> 01:14:51.584
John, do you think we ought to
scrap our cars?

01:14:53.109 --> 01:14:53.418
Huh?

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.113
You see, according to your
gas consumption and mileage record ...

01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:59.892
each car averages 15 miles a day ...

01:14:59.933 --> 01:15:03.771
at 1 mile per gallon,
while parked in a garage.

01:15:03.796 --> 01:15:07.058
It would mean bankruptcy if we
actually took them out on the road.

01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:09.518
We did those figures wrong ...

01:15:09.518 --> 01:15:11.896
by about ... half.

01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:13.606
John, do you have a suitcase?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.653
Yeah, I have five.
I could always use another one.

01:15:19.737 --> 01:15:21.405
Well, five will do very nicely, John.

01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:26.619
Pack all five and be out of
this house in 45 minutes ...

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.080
or I will shoot you on sight
for trespassing.

01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:32.666
I-I-I, I don't get it.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.460
I'll try to clarify it, John.

01:15:34.502 --> 01:15:37.505
You're being fired
because you are a cheap crook.

01:15:37.546 --> 01:15:42.218
Now, if you are not out of this house
and off these grounds in 45 minutes ...

01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:44.929
I will shoot you as a trespasser ...

01:15:45.012 --> 01:15:47.348
with proved criminal intentions.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:51.644
And I am an excellent shot.
Does that make it clearer?

01:15:55.357 --> 01:16:02.146
Well, er ... why, if you gotta
act like that ... I quit.

01:16:06.784 --> 01:16:11.539
As for the rest of you, you have
exactly two hours to get out.

01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:13.374
Out!

01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:18.003
And I do not believe that
for one second.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.876
Is the party over already?

01:16:27.596 --> 01:16:29.348
You too, Madam.

01:16:30.383 --> 01:16:31.983
He means business!

01:16:43.112 --> 01:16:47.858
Henry, there are a lot of strange
people in the house, who are they?

01:16:47.925 --> 01:16:49.844
Yeah. They are not people,
Henrietta, they are servants.

01:16:49.927 --> 01:16:51.203
I hired them this morning.

01:16:51.287 --> 01:16:52.955
You know, Henry, Mrs Traggert
will be furious.

01:16:53.372 --> 01:16:55.791
Mrs Traggert has been fired along
with the rest of the staff ...

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.502
so her emotional responses need
no longer concern you.

01:16:58.544 --> 01:17:00.671
Oh, Erica, this is Mrs Graham.

01:17:00.713 --> 01:17:03.090
This is our new housekeeper.
She'll be working under Harold.

01:17:04.674 --> 01:17:08.241
Fine. Fine. Thank you.
You may go now, Erica.

01:17:08.554 --> 01:17:12.683
Henrietta, come, please.
Thank you. You may go, Erica.

01:17:12.767 --> 01:17:15.353
Henrietta, come.

01:17:15.603 --> 01:17:17.980
Don't shake hands, please.

01:17:18.022 --> 01:17:20.107
Don't shake hands
with the servants, Henrietta.

01:17:20.191 --> 01:17:23.361
It destroys all hope of any discipline.

01:17:23.444 --> 01:17:26.489
- You fired Mrs Traggert?
- Yes, I fired Mrs Traggert.

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.241
- You fired John, too?
- Especially John.

01:17:29.909 --> 01:17:31.118
And they agreed?

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.953
We didn't vote on it, Henrietta.

01:17:33.162 --> 01:17:34.538
I simply told them they were fired.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.915
Which reminds me ...

01:17:36.082 --> 01:17:38.751
How attached are you to Mr McPherson?

01:17:39.627 --> 01:17:42.421
Oh no, oh no, Henry.

01:17:42.463 --> 01:17:44.048
He's a total incompetent, Henrietta.

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:47.093
Do you have an idea how much money
has been spent to run this house?

01:17:47.426 --> 01:17:49.387
No, but Andrew knows.

01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:51.722
Andrew has co-signed all
of Mrs Traggert's checks.

01:17:51.847 --> 01:17:54.141
Really, he has his finger on everything.

01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:56.811
He co-signed all of
Mrs Traggert's checks?

01:17:56.936 --> 01:17:58.905
Yes. He's very thorough.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.664
- Henry ...
- Did ... you ... allow Mrs Traggert ...

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:09.448
to have ... her own ...
checking account?

01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:12.451
Yes. It was the household account.

01:18:12.493 --> 01:18:15.162
She said it would be easier for her.

01:18:15.329 --> 01:18:18.165
So I ... I, er ... did.

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.002
- Henrietta.
- Yes?

01:18:24.755 --> 01:18:25.923
Never, er, never mind ... I ...

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:30.344
Henrietta, I'll handle the
finances from here on in.

01:18:30.428 --> 01:18:31.137
Yes.

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:34.682
I would like the bank to issue a statement
covering all your accounts ...

01:18:36.416 --> 01:18:40.581
and please instruct them that no check
has to be drawn on any account ...

01:18:40.636 --> 01:18:42.569
unless it was co-signed by me.

01:18:43.024 --> 01:18:48.195
I can go over your holdings and your
federal and state tax returns after you're...

01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:53.284
after you're ... after,
afterwa-, afterwards.

01:18:54.177 --> 01:18:57.477
Holdings and federal, okay.
Heavens. Oh.

01:18:58.039 --> 01:18:59.623
Just a piece of cotton, dear.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.961
- Oh, Henrietta?
- Yes?

01:19:04.045 --> 01:19:07.715
I suppose you're absolutely satisfied
with the organic method?

01:19:07.882 --> 01:19:09.967
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

01:19:18.583 --> 01:19:19.253
- Shut up!

01:19:19.315 --> 01:19:20.982
Now, Mr McPherson.
I want you to do something about this.

01:19:21.354 --> 01:19:24.097
- I didn't even get my two weeks' notice.
- Nobody did.

01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:26.400
If a judge sees those salaries ...

01:19:26.442 --> 01:19:28.569
he'll clamp you in jail on spec.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.323
Very few chauffeurs make $600 a week.

01:19:32.365 --> 01:19:36.035
- $300. You get half ...
- From all of us.

01:19:36.077 --> 01:19:38.871
I advise you to keep
your mouth shut about that.

01:19:39.914 --> 01:19:43.117
According to the records, I don't take
anything at all, and don't you forget it.

01:19:43.392 --> 01:19:44.392
Is that so?

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:52.013
Alright, alright. Laura! Take it easy.
Wait a minute. Wait. Laura? Lester?

01:19:52.051 --> 01:19:54.328
- Laura. Kids.
- I'm not a kid.

01:19:54.412 --> 01:19:56.271
- Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Let him talk.

01:19:56.355 --> 01:19:58.732
Kids, we've been together
a long time, right?

01:19:59.308 --> 01:20:00.935
We've been a great team.

01:20:01.352 --> 01:20:05.648
We've had some bad years and good years.

01:20:06.732 --> 01:20:10.444
We laughed a little. Cried a little.

01:20:11.904 --> 01:20:16.075
Put a little away together.
But it's all over now.

01:20:17.576 --> 01:20:19.328
There's nothing we can do about it.

01:20:21.539 --> 01:20:22.456
- Yes, Mariamne?

01:20:23.374 --> 01:20:24.792
<i> The bank chief called ... </i>

01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:26.502
<i> saying that Mr Graham
has instructed them ...</i>

01:20:26.544 --> 01:20:29.255
<i> not to issue any funds
without his signature.</i>

01:20:37.096 --> 01:20:40.307
Henry, you have a B.A. in history.

01:20:41.135 --> 01:20:42.002
<i>... gardening shed ...</i>

01:20:41.642 --> 01:20:44.145
Oh, Henry, how wonderful.

01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:50.300
<i>Whom do I know with a gardening shed?</i>

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.574
<i>I sprayed and the crown gall was gone.</i>

01:21:01.746 --> 01:21:03.205
What an exciting coincidence.

01:21:03.247 --> 01:21:05.082
Have you ever thought
of teaching, dear?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.420
<i>There is an instructorship opening
this fall, in history ...</i>

01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:12.882
<i>and there seems to be absolutely no
prospect at filling up the place ...</i>

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:17.181
<i>with so many of the teachers
appointed to the science department ...</i>

01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:41.651
<i>... back in the evening together.</i>

01:21:41.727 --> 01:21:42.519
Never.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:44.029
Don't you?

01:21:49.418 --> 01:21:52.505
We could have lunch together
in the teachers' cafeteria ...

01:21:53.422 --> 01:21:58.386
and then, every semester, we could grade
our term papers together in the study.

01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:02.223
Henrietta, for the last time.
I have no inclination to teach.

01:22:02.425 --> 01:22:03.892
No, not the slightest.

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:07.595
How do you know, dear,
if you've never tried?

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:08.979
Instinct.

01:22:09.366 --> 01:22:12.499
... on a cash basis ... accrual basis ...

01:22:13.154 --> 01:22:15.821
... therefore deduct taxes in the
year in which they are actually paid ...

01:22:15.903 --> 01:22:16.896
Henry?

01:22:16.946 --> 01:22:19.782
Might as well finish the
accounts and get you ...

01:22:19.824 --> 01:22:22.118
and get them out of the way before
the end of the week.

01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:26.664
He handles the income taxes rather well.

01:22:26.956 --> 01:22:30.209
Henry, I wanted to ask you something.

01:22:30.543 --> 01:22:33.379
- What?
- I wanted to ask you something.

01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:37.466
Well, you know that every summer
I go on a field trip ...

01:22:38.342 --> 01:22:39.760
for my research work.

01:22:39.802 --> 01:22:43.806
And ... I was just wondering if this year ...

01:22:43.848 --> 01:22:46.100
it would be alright
if I went on a field trip?

01:22:46.183 --> 01:22:48.436
Field trip?
For how long?

01:22:48.519 --> 01:22:50.813
Only for a week or two.

01:22:51.022 --> 01:22:54.984
I ... I thought I might go on
a canoe trip on the Adirondacks.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.778
It's ... it's very lovely there.

01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.864
It's all sort of tangled and isolated.

01:23:00.364 --> 01:23:04.076
And, erm ... I usually go
with one of my students.

01:23:05.145 --> 01:23:08.305
But, erm ... I just ...
it just occurred to me ...

01:23:08.622 --> 01:23:15.087
that this year ... you and I
might perhaps go together.

01:23:15.212 --> 01:23:17.506
- Together?
- To the Adirondacks.

01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:26.390
The Adirondacks.
Would we need a guide or anyone?

01:23:27.016 --> 01:23:28.851
Not if we didn't wander from our camp.

01:23:29.977 --> 01:23:32.605
And I would feel perfectly safe
with you there, Henry.

01:23:32.897 --> 01:23:35.524
I would feel safer
even than with a guide.

01:23:35.858 --> 01:23:37.818
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?

01:23:38.486 --> 01:23:40.446
Sounds like the answer to everything.

01:23:43.157 --> 01:23:45.451
- Harold, can't I use a suitcase?
- I wouldn't if I were you, sir.

01:23:45.493 --> 01:23:49.163
I think carrying a suitcase through the
woods would prove something of a hazard.

01:23:49.663 --> 01:23:53.000
- Well, don't forget to pack my Swiss army.
- Yes.

01:23:59.006 --> 01:24:02.259
Mrs Graham seems to be a most
good-natured lady. sir.

01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:04.970
I'm pleased that the marriage
is working out so well.

01:24:05.179 --> 01:24:08.391
She's not good-natured.
She is regressed.

01:24:09.225 --> 01:24:13.396
I have never seen such
a helpless human being.

01:24:16.899 --> 01:24:21.028
Do you remember some
weeks ago, sir, when ...

01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:23.948
when you told me that
you'd lost all your money?

01:24:23.989 --> 01:24:26.325
and you had no skills and no ambitions

01:24:26.492 --> 01:24:31.122
Harold, don't forget to pack the compasses
and the maps. We will need those.

01:24:31.163 --> 01:24:34.625
Yes, sir. But it seems you do have
skills and ambitions.

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:36.544
I mean, look how you've
taken over the house.

01:24:36.585 --> 01:24:39.630
You've learned to handle accounts
and grapple with taxes ...

01:24:39.672 --> 01:24:41.048
and you've tidied up Mrs Graham.

01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:44.427
Oh, no. I forgot to check her before
she went to school this morning.

01:24:45.094 --> 01:24:48.973
She'll be walking around all day with
price tags dangling from her sleeves.

01:24:49.056 --> 01:24:50.307
I took the liberty, sir.

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.060
Oh, thank you Harold.
Was she free of crumbs?

01:24:53.102 --> 01:24:55.229
Only a slight sprinkling, sir.
I brushed her up.

01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:56.814
Well, sir, my point is, sir ...

01:24:56.939 --> 01:25:00.359
that you have shown
the most surprising talent, sir ...

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:03.988
and although Mrs Graham's helplessness
is a little bit irritating at times ...

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:06.907
couldn't it be in some strange way, sir ...

01:25:07.033 --> 01:25:08.701
that this very helplessness ...

01:25:08.743 --> 01:25:11.662
has been the stimulus of your own
amazing new competence?

01:25:11.704 --> 01:25:13.330
I mean, very often, sir ...

01:25:13.372 --> 01:25:15.958
you know, what we... what we
dislike most in other people ...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.919
is only a reflection about our
own inadequacies, sir ...

01:25:18.961 --> 01:25:20.337
- and our own shortcomings.
- Harold.

01:25:20.379 --> 01:25:23.132
Why don't you pack the revolver?
Please put the flask down, Harold.

01:25:23.215 --> 01:25:28.179
Put the flask down. Pack ... never mind.
Just put the flask down. Put the revolver down.

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.848
I'll do it. You may go now, Harold.
Thank you very much.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.059
Yes, sir.

01:25:39.482 --> 01:25:44.070
Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:47.410
Henry! Henry!

01:25:48.324 --> 01:25:50.117
Easy, Henrietta. I'll be right down.

01:26:03.672 --> 01:26:05.424
- Henry?
- I'm here.

01:26:05.841 --> 01:26:10.346
Relax. Just easy.
Catch your breath. That's it.

01:26:10.721 --> 01:26:13.015
Relax. Calm down.

01:26:13.974 --> 01:26:17.436
Here we are. Sit down.

01:26:17.478 --> 01:26:22.483
That's it. That's it, now.
Catch your breath. What is it?

01:26:23.275 --> 01:26:24.860
It's been accepted.

01:26:25.903 --> 01:26:29.865
My Alsophila ignocardium grahami.
They've accepted it.

01:26:29.907 --> 01:26:33.369
Try to speak calm, my dear.
What is it they have accepted?

01:26:33.452 --> 01:26:34.954
It's a tropical tree-fern.

01:26:34.995 --> 01:26:37.498
And I discovered it during our honeymoon.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.669
And when I couldn't classify it,
I thought it might be a true species.

01:26:41.794 --> 01:26:44.400
But I couldn't believe it,
so I sent it to Wagner ...

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:50.678
at the University of Michigan.
And Henry, it is. It's a true species.

01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:53.723
I've discovered a true species.

01:26:55.266 --> 01:26:59.562
Well. That's very nice. Very nice.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:05.192
Well, well. Now you'll be able to name
a whole species, won't you?

01:27:05.317 --> 01:27:07.319
Just like ... what's his name?

01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:10.614
- Louis de Bougainville.
- That's right. Or James Parkinson.

01:27:11.115 --> 01:27:13.159
Or ... Brussels sprouts.

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:19.123
Well, well, well. You've achieved the kind
of immortality after all, haven't you?

01:27:19.165 --> 01:27:21.542
Now you'll be in all the
atlases under L ...

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:23.878
right before Morgan,
Muller and Mendel.

01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:27.298
It would be cross-indexed under G.

01:27:28.466 --> 01:27:30.551
Alsophila grahami, for Graham.

01:27:31.469 --> 01:27:32.219
For Graham?

01:27:33.888 --> 01:27:37.850
You mean that you've discovered a new
species and have named it for Graham ...

01:27:37.892 --> 01:27:39.685
after doing all your work as Lowell?

01:27:39.727 --> 01:27:41.729
You fool.
That's not the way to name a species.

01:27:41.812 --> 01:27:42.855
Can't you do anything right?

01:27:42.897 --> 01:27:46.359
I didn't name it for me, Henry,
I named it for you.

01:27:46.901 --> 01:27:49.570
Alsophila grahami, for Henry Graham.

01:27:50.279 --> 01:27:52.865
Alsophila grahami, for Henry Graham.

01:27:53.407 --> 01:27:57.745
Well, are you sure that they'll know ...
I mean, that it's me?

01:27:59.705 --> 01:28:02.291
Will they have my name in the atlas
under ... under G?

01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:03.084
For Henry Graham?

01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:06.337
Yes, and they'll have you in all the
textbooks, Henry, as a footnote ...

01:28:06.379 --> 01:28:09.090
As a footnote ...
and in the atlases under G.

01:28:10.132 --> 01:28:14.345
Well, I've achieved a small slice of
immortality myself, haven't I?

01:28:14.387 --> 01:28:16.263
As a footnote and under G.

01:28:16.764 --> 01:28:18.724
Are you pleased, Henry?

01:28:19.225 --> 01:28:22.520
Oh yes, it was very thoughtful of you,
Henrietta. I believe I am pleased.

01:28:22.687 --> 01:28:26.857
I put a tip of one fern
into a plastic token ...

01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:29.735
so that you can wear it always.
If you want to.

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:35.324
Oh yes. Well, why not? I mean ...
it will be a wonderful conversation piece.

01:28:35.574 --> 01:28:39.328
"What frond is in your token, Henry?"

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:44.375
"Oh, my own frond. An Alsophila grahami.
Why do you ask?"

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:45.876
You like it?

01:28:46.168 --> 01:28:47.878
Yes, yes. very attractive, isn't it?

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.797
Good lines. I mean, for a frond.

01:28:50.089 --> 01:28:54.343
Don't you ... don't you think it should
be under ... under L? I mean ...

01:28:54.385 --> 01:28:57.596
Alsophila lowellia or something?

01:28:57.888 --> 01:29:00.683
I feel as though you've given me
your place in the atlases.

01:29:00.725 --> 01:29:04.854
Henry, I don't think I could have
ever discovered it without you.

01:29:04.979 --> 01:29:06.772
You gave me confidence.

01:29:06.814 --> 01:29:12.028
You remember? You said that if being
with you was going to give me confidence ...

01:29:12.069 --> 01:29:14.989
I was going to be a
very confident botanist.

01:29:16.407 --> 01:29:17.616
Well, you were right.

01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:26.333
Alsophila grahami.
Well, well, well ...

01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:35.968
Henrietta, what happens if you
get lost in these woods?

01:29:36.343 --> 01:29:40.431
- Well, various things.
- Various things such as what?

01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:42.224
For example, if there is a stream ...

01:29:43.267 --> 01:29:45.311
then you would follow the stream.

01:29:45.394 --> 01:29:48.939
- Which way?
- We would follow the stream upstream.

01:29:51.025 --> 01:29:53.736
Henry, I'm having such a wonderful time.

01:29:53.861 --> 01:29:58.240
Our entire marriage has been
like a long, beautiful field trip.

01:29:58.366 --> 01:30:01.202
That's nice.
That makes me feel better somehow.

01:30:13.113 --> 01:30:14.501
Would you like some more Z11?

01:30:14.941 --> 01:30:17.574
No thank you.
It's the Z11 that's attracting them.

01:30:17.635 --> 01:30:18.928
It's a repellent.

01:30:18.969 --> 01:30:20.596
So they would lead you to believe.

01:30:25.393 --> 01:30:27.478
Would you like some more
Calamine lotion, dear?

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.438
No, thank you.
It only makes it itch more.

01:30:31.899 --> 01:30:35.361
They say that if you don't scratch,
it itches less.

01:30:35.403 --> 01:30:36.362
Well, they're wrong.

01:30:36.404 --> 01:30:39.281
It only looks like it itches less
because you're not scratching.

01:30:41.409 --> 01:30:44.453
One just got me on the bridge of the nose.

01:30:46.455 --> 01:30:47.998
Should we put something on it?

01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:50.543
No, thank you.

01:30:58.134 --> 01:31:01.178
From now on, Henrietta,
I'll make the coffee.

01:31:01.846 --> 01:31:02.847
Yes, dear.

01:31:27.288 --> 01:31:28.789
You're all sticky, Henrietta.

01:31:29.749 --> 01:31:31.417
I spilled the honey.

01:31:34.879 --> 01:31:35.963
Here, Henrietta.

01:31:37.631 --> 01:31:41.552
From now on, dear,
I'll make the dinner.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.888
What will I do?

01:31:44.013 --> 01:31:45.014
You'll eat.

01:31:53.898 --> 01:31:55.941
It seems easier to paddle somehow.

01:31:55.983 --> 01:32:00.029
That's because the current gets
stronger as we approach the rapids.

01:32:00.321 --> 01:32:02.198
Look, dear, aren't they beautiful?

01:32:03.382 --> 01:32:03.999
What?

01:32:04.433 --> 01:32:05.559
The rapids.

01:32:09.955 --> 01:32:11.123
Those are the rapids?

01:32:11.207 --> 01:32:15.419
Yes. Just tell me exactly what
to do, dear. I'm a very good sailor.

01:32:15.836 --> 01:32:17.755
Paddle like hell towards shore!

01:32:21.363 --> 01:32:22.463
Aaaah!

01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:24.669
- What?
- Never mind!

01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:27.056
- Never mind?
- Never mind!

01:32:27.098 --> 01:32:30.226
Do I have to paddle in any particular
direction, dear?

01:32:30.267 --> 01:32:32.019
Full harder to the left side!

01:32:33.688 --> 01:32:35.815
The left side! Full harder!

01:32:39.318 --> 01:32:43.489
Although we keep fulling on the left side,
we seem to be heading towards the bank.

01:32:44.624 --> 01:32:46.642
Aaaahhh! The right side!

01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.536
The right side!

01:32:56.335 --> 01:32:58.796
Henry, how much longer do
the rapids go on?

01:32:59.964 --> 01:33:00.881
That's odd.

01:33:02.508 --> 01:33:03.843
It just seems to stop.

01:33:04.093 --> 01:33:09.890
Oh, Henry! Listen!
Henry, it sounds like a waterfall!

01:33:09.932 --> 01:33:12.476
Oh my God. That's what it is.

01:33:12.518 --> 01:33:14.729
It just stops and becomes a waterfall.

01:33:15.104 --> 01:33:18.274
Paddle like hell towards the bank!
Towards the bank!

01:33:18.441 --> 01:33:21.027
There is no bank!
There is just a lot of rocks!

01:33:41.922 --> 01:33:42.882
Henry?

01:33:45.509 --> 01:33:46.635
Henry?

01:33:46.927 --> 01:33:48.304
I can't ...

01:33:48.846 --> 01:33:51.932
I can't swim.

01:34:28.684 --> 01:34:30.084
<i>Henry!</i>

01:34:30.471 --> 01:34:35.810
Henrietta, you hold on on to
that log until I tell you to let go!

01:34:49.532 --> 01:34:54.245
The canoe overturned. I looked
desperately through the waters but ...

01:34:54.286 --> 01:34:56.997
I ... I couldn't find her.

01:34:58.666 --> 01:34:59.792
Henry?

01:35:04.046 --> 01:35:06.700
And ... if only she had told me
she couldn't swim.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.844
If only we had taken a guide.

01:35:11.262 --> 01:35:15.850
But she had her heart set on
going with me alone.

01:35:19.145 --> 01:35:22.565
Alright, Henrietta!
I'm ready for you now!

01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:27.987
Take a deep breath,
hold your nose and let go!

01:35:47.214 --> 01:35:49.967
Henrietta, look. I mean ...

01:35:52.219 --> 01:35:55.639
Look. An Alsophila grahami.

01:36:00.686 --> 01:36:02.980
Alsophila grahami.

01:36:04.523 --> 01:36:06.317
Up here, in the north woods.

01:36:20.498 --> 01:36:23.292
I've lost it.
I've lost my token.

01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:26.629
I've lost my Alsophila grahami.

01:36:27.421 --> 01:36:28.255
Henrietta.

01:36:28.964 --> 01:36:31.258
Henrietta! Dammit to hell!

01:36:32.051 --> 01:36:34.804
Damn, damn, damn! Nothing ever turns out
the way it's supposed to be ...

01:36:34.887 --> 01:36:38.265
Work a plan.
Henrietta! Dammit!

01:36:52.196 --> 01:36:56.242
Alright.
You may breathe now, Henrietta.

01:36:58.244 --> 01:37:00.329
You may breathe now.
Let go of your nose.

01:37:03.124 --> 01:37:06.334
Now, hold my shoulders. Face me.
Hold my shoulders. That's it.

01:37:06.718 --> 01:37:10.800
Hold on to them. Alright.
Hold them.

01:37:10.806 --> 01:37:13.559
Breathe, breathe.
Through your mouth.

01:37:13.634 --> 01:37:16.300
Keep your chin up.
Chin up.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.348
Breathe through your mouth.
That's it.

01:37:19.557 --> 01:37:22.101
And if you taste water, spit it out.

01:37:23.394 --> 01:37:28.983
Don't spit on me, Henrietta.
Just spit the water out into the river.

01:37:30.276 --> 01:37:35.740
That's it. That's it.
Now breathe. Very good.

01:37:59.347 --> 01:38:04.977
Here now. Sit down in the sun
and warm up.

01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:07.610
That's right.

01:38:15.547 --> 01:38:16.547
That's right.

01:38:18.456 --> 01:38:19.456
There.

01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:21.202
Are you still cold?

01:38:22.286 --> 01:38:25.623
Well, I better hold you. My body
should provide some warmth.

01:38:37.319 --> 01:38:40.058
Henry. Henry. Henry?

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:44.882
I'll always be able to
depend on you, won't I?

01:38:44.934 --> 01:38:46.644
All the rest of my life?

01:38:46.977 --> 01:38:48.813
I'm afraid so.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.650
Henry, the history classes are going
to be much smaller this year.

01:38:52.692 --> 01:38:54.652
Henrietta, I'm not going to teach history.

01:38:54.735 --> 01:38:55.820
Probably.

01:38:56.821 --> 01:39:02.284
It seems a shame, though, Henry.
You are a very talented man.

01:39:05.538 --> 01:39:07.498
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

01:39:07.623 --> 01:39:10.710
I don't know.
I have no mind as far as I can tell.

01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:14.296
Are you still cold?

01:39:15.673 --> 01:39:17.800
- I'm a little warmer.
- Good.

01:39:23.723 --> 01:39:27.193
- Henry? Henry?
- Yes?

01:39:31.603 --> 01:39:36.670
I know that this isn't
exactly what you planned.

01:39:38.595 --> 01:39:39.554
What?

01:39:42.116 --> 01:39:44.702
But will you mind doing it very much?

01:39:46.287 --> 01:39:47.747
Being a history instructor?

01:39:48.789 --> 01:39:51.083
And going to the university
with you in the mornings?

01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:57.923
And ... grading term papers with you
in the study every semester?

01:40:00.134 --> 01:40:01.427
Not terribly.

01:40:06.724 --> 01:40:09.727
Come. I think we'd better go.
