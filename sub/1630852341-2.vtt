Geralt!

00:23.291 --> 00:25.250
-[sighs]
-I was only at the market, Yen.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.916
I made more than a few pennies
thanks to your garden.

00:30.625 --> 00:31.583
[chuckles]

00:33.916 --> 00:35.916
I can't wait to grow old together.

00:36.916 --> 00:38.333
You, me, and her.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.916
The family we always dreamed of.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.583
[gasps]

00:44.750 --> 00:46.083
[voice whispering] That's a… very…

00:46.166 --> 00:47.416
pretty dream.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.416
[voice fading] Pretty dream…

00:59.125 --> 00:59.958
Geralt!

01:00.041 --> 01:01.083
[baby screaming]

01:07.666 --> 01:09.000
Give her to me.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.708

She's ours.

[gasping]

01:37.291 --> 01:38.666
[horse neighs]

01:40.958 --> 01:43.291
[gasping] I said don't touch me.

01:43.791 --> 01:45.583
-Wake up.

01:45.666 --> 01:46.791
Don't touch me!

01:55.208 --> 01:56.791
We're moving away from Cintra.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.000
Fuck.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.833
Finally, an honest response.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.291
-Ow!
-We're stuck here together.

02:07.666 --> 02:10.000
Who knows,
maybe we'll be friends yet again.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.541
We'll be saved.

02:13.958 --> 02:15.083
I have faith.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.875
Forget faith. We've got power.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.583

[wheels stop]

[bolts rattling]

02:26.250 --> 02:27.250
Keep them close.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.166
Where are you taking us?

02:38.291 --> 02:40.083
I'm a citizen of Nilfgaard.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.416
The soldiers you killed
were also Nilfgaardians.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.708
Istredd spoke of these.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.166
They look like Aretuza.

02:49.875 --> 02:52.125
Built by elves to honor the prophets.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.166
You set fire to them in the early wars.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.083
Better lost to history than humans.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.125
[Yennefer] I've never seen so many elves.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.750
[Filavandrel] I need to see her.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.000
I come bearing gifts.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.541
[Fringilla] What is this place?

03:16.625 --> 03:18.125
You keep behind me.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.375
You keep your mouths shut.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.750
[chains rattle]

03:38.750 --> 03:42.583
Nilfgaard's fight is with
the Northern Kingdoms, not with the elves.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.208
Set us free,

03:47.041 --> 03:48.708
-and we promise to grant you s--
-[whoosh]

03:56.083 --> 03:58.041
[in Elder] You said gifts.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.750
Hostages. Humans--

04:00.833 --> 04:04.375
You should have hung their corpses nearby.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.041
They can be of use.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.833
These are human forests.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.166
They're our forests.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.291
This one was in dimeritium?

04:13.375 --> 04:15.125
This one was a captive of Nilfgaard.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.375
I'm also an elf.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.208
[in Elder] Is this how you treat your own?

04:22.666 --> 04:24.375
Do you sing our songs?

04:25.875 --> 04:27.708
Do you honor our elders?

04:29.625 --> 04:32.125
Have you ever shed a tear
over anything elven?

04:34.708 --> 04:36.000
You are no elf.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.000
-String them up.
-We've been digging here for weeks.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.833
Every day increases
the risk of being found.

04:44.916 --> 04:47.583
You don't lead our people any more,
Filavandrel.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.666
Or has the White Robed One
visited your dreams too?

04:54.666 --> 04:56.625
I'm doing everything I can
to keep you safe.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.666
Once we find what we're looking for,

05:02.750 --> 05:06.291
we ship their heads back to Aretuza
as a reminder of elven glory.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.750
[wind whistling]

05:33.375 --> 05:34.708
[Roach snorts]

05:34.791 --> 05:35.916
We're nearly there.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.041
[Ciri] This is your home?

06:18.416 --> 06:20.083
How many did you say there were?

06:20.708 --> 06:21.625
I didn't.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.083
Last I checked…

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
we were 20.

06:32.875 --> 06:33.708
Now?

06:34.375 --> 06:35.333
Maybe less.

06:41.875 --> 06:43.125
You sure we're safe here?

06:44.541 --> 06:45.416
[Geralt] Keep up.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.125
[murmur of voices]

06:52.708 --> 06:53.958

06:56.083 --> 06:58.166

-[door slams]

06:58.250 --> 06:59.708
[man] Here comes trouble!

07:13.958 --> 07:16.083
Where the fuck have you been?

07:16.166 --> 07:17.875
We thought you got lost.

07:17.958 --> 07:18.791
Or killed.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.250
-Not yet.
-[man chuckles]

07:21.333 --> 07:22.166
Sorry.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.333
[laughs]

07:25.416 --> 07:27.000
-Brother!
-So!

07:27.083 --> 07:28.958
-He returns.
-Come here!

07:29.041 --> 07:31.208
-Knew you'd make a fuckin' entrance.
-He's back.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.416
-Finally, brother.
-I knew it.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.750
Wolf. You're home.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.625
Finally.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.000
-[Geralt] Vesemir.
-Huh?

07:40.041 --> 07:40.875
Yeah.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.875
I had to make a few stops.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.750
Hmm.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.166
[man] He's home!

07:52.333 --> 07:53.333
Brother!

07:53.916 --> 07:56.000
-[laughter]
-There's the man!

07:59.875 --> 08:05.875
So, there I am, freezing my bollocks off
in the middle of a grain field

08:05.958 --> 08:07.375
for the second straight night,

08:07.958 --> 08:13.166
when the farmer's wife comes sneaking out
to tell me that I'm wasting my time.

08:14.208 --> 08:18.041
It wasn't a mora
her husband saw leaving that room.

08:18.833 --> 08:19.666
No.

08:20.916 --> 08:22.875
It was the fucking field hand!

08:22.958 --> 08:24.958
[laughter]

08:25.625 --> 08:28.416
Oh, and now she's wailing,
"Oh, what are we gonna do?"

08:28.500 --> 08:32.125
"My husband won't pay you
if you don't deliver a mora head!"

08:32.208 --> 08:33.666
[chuckles]

08:33.750 --> 08:35.958
So I pulled out my sword and I said…

08:37.875 --> 08:40.875
"Bet he'll pay double
for the field hand's."

08:40.958 --> 08:41.875
[laughter]

08:42.750 --> 08:43.958
Good old Lambchop.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.875
She returned
with two horses and a fur rug.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.458
Best job I had all year. [chuckles]

08:49.541 --> 08:52.500
Each of your faces
is cause enough for celebration.

08:54.583 --> 08:58.000
You're safe. You made it back.
You made it home.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.458
-Aye.
-Hear, hear!

09:00.625 --> 09:02.708
Here's to another winter, together.

09:02.791 --> 09:03.625
Yeah.

09:03.708 --> 09:04.875
-Well said.
-Aye.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.333
To breath in our lungs.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.291
Hear, hear!

09:07.375 --> 09:08.416
To the brothers.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.375
[men] The brothers.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.666
To forgetting the fucking Path!

09:12.500 --> 09:15.041
For one fucking night.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.958
-Who's ready?
-[all] Eskel!

09:18.041 --> 09:19.750
-[laughter]
-Eskel's back!

09:20.458 --> 09:23.125
Are you all right?
You look like day-old shit.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.875
You should see the other guy.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.375
Hmm.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.291
The bout lasted six hours.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.375
I'd have got the fucker, too,

09:37.458 --> 09:38.875
if hadn't lost my elixirs.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.291
[scattered laughter]

09:40.375 --> 09:41.625
Took her hand, though.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.791
-What's that?
-Is that a leshy?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.000
Is that a leshy?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.583
-What is it?
-[Eskel] Walked like one.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.083
Talked like one.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.791
Sort of.

09:52.416 --> 09:53.250
Sort of?

09:54.333 --> 09:56.583
I haven't crossed a leshy in a while.

09:56.666 --> 09:59.416
-Not in Kaedwen.
-[Eskel] Well, count yourselves lucky.

10:00.458 --> 10:03.625
Unless you're aching for the sting
of one of their fucking roots.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.541
[men murmuring]

10:05.625 --> 10:09.333
Fire through the heart
is the only thing that puts one down.

10:10.625 --> 10:13.916
-Six hours in, that didn't occur to you?
-[scattered laughter]

10:15.750 --> 10:16.583
[chuckles]

10:16.666 --> 10:17.875

Who the hell are you?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.041
[swallows]

10:44.125 --> 10:45.750
Princess Cirilla of Cintra.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.291
Pleasure to meet you.

When you told me
you called the Law of Surprise--

11:39.541 --> 11:41.875
-[sighs]
-…I told you, "Big mistake."

11:41.958 --> 11:43.125
[horse neighs]

11:43.208 --> 11:46.500
You said you promised
you wouldn't claim the child.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.208
I said, "Good. Still a big mistake."

11:52.375 --> 11:54.541
-I had to save her.
-I know.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.458
And you knew I would call you out on it.

11:58.666 --> 11:59.500
Yeah.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.000
You brought her here anyway.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.416

12:28.458 --> 12:31.166
[Vesemir] So you're telling me
she escaped Nilfgaard.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.958
Survived the wholesale slaughter
of her kingdom.

12:36.458 --> 12:37.333
How?

12:38.083 --> 12:38.916
I asked.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.791
-She lied.
-Hmm.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.541
It's not like you to let it go.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.708
Witchers watch for answers.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.750
-I think you might've said that one.
-Oh, what was I thinking?

12:50.833 --> 12:51.958
[both chuckle]

12:54.833 --> 12:56.500
I brought her here so she'd be safe.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.750
It's easier for me to protect her
within these walls.

12:59.833 --> 13:03.750
-Long enough to watch for answers?
-Exactly. Learn who she is. What she is.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.416
And how I can help her.

13:07.916 --> 13:08.791
You say that…

13:09.875 --> 13:11.750
but remember what happened the last time

13:11.833 --> 13:15.500
witchers shoved their noses
into the dramas of courts and kingdoms.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.708
[sighs] What if your princess
is more than you bargained for?

13:21.625 --> 13:22.916
I know that already.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.250
-[Eskel] Princess.
-[gasps]

13:32.916 --> 13:33.750
Eskel.

13:36.291 --> 13:39.708
I'm just exploring.
Told Geralt I'd find a good room.

13:39.791 --> 13:40.958
[chuckles]

13:43.208 --> 13:44.166
Well, this…

13:45.125 --> 13:47.875
isn't a castle, Your Highness.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.458
They're all shitholes.

Tissaia said elven mages were dead.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.500
She was wrong. Or lied.

14:57.583 --> 14:58.791
-Hmm.
-Neither's a shock.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.916
-You had a nightmare earlier.
-Night terrors are common after battle.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.666
-You've had them--
-What was yours about?

15:05.750 --> 15:08.875
-Is now the time to share stories--
-Do you really think I'm asking

15:08.958 --> 15:10.708
because I personally give a shit?

15:11.833 --> 15:13.541
Did you dream of someone hidden in a robe?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.250
A black robe. How did you know that?

15:18.750 --> 15:20.333
I've dreamt of one in red.

15:21.916 --> 15:24.125
And our elven mage dreams of one in white.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.625
Shared dreams are a powerful omen.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.458
Yes, well, I'm topped off
on magical mystery at the moment.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.666
What matters is, we can use this
to our advantage.

They lick the boots of humans.

16:00.666 --> 16:03.333
The same boots
that will eventually crush their necks.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.583
You deserve better, brother.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.125
All of us do.

16:08.208 --> 16:12.541
You promised us Dol Blathanna.
How much longer must we search in vain?

16:12.625 --> 16:15.000
Each sun sets on fewer elves.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.625
Our land is stained, our elders dead.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.166
Even our caves at the edge of the world
have fallen to monsters.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.958
But we mustn't lose faith
in a bright elven future.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.708
What has been need not always be.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.833
-I know these ruins will bear answers.
-[lute plays]

16:31.916 --> 16:34.625
The visions I've had
since entering these woods give faith.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.458
[ringing sound]

16:36.541 --> 16:38.541
[speaking Elder]

16:39.208 --> 16:41.041
The white robe hides her face,

16:41.125 --> 16:44.000
but I know it's Ithlinne,
our most sacred prophet,

16:44.083 --> 16:46.041
guiding us to safe havens.

16:46.541 --> 16:47.875
We will rebuild.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.166
Not meat, but it'll dull your hunger.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.666
I will not let us down.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.750
What has been need not always be.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.000
[sighs]

17:13.458 --> 17:15.291
I've never heard it sung with words.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.708
The heimlon you were playing.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.916
A man I knew,
he said it was to guide lost elves home.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.416
Those I've lost, yes.
Dead elves and orphaned elves.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.958
The lyrics change often.

17:33.958 --> 17:37.250
The White Flame wants to punish
the very people who oppress yours.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.291
Thieving a thief
merely makes you the latest thief.

17:42.916 --> 17:46.208
Or tell me, does the White Flame intend
to hand Xintrea back

17:46.291 --> 17:48.541
when he's done
dancing on Calanthe's grave?

17:48.625 --> 17:51.500
-Xintrea?
-Cintra's elven name before it was stolen.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.666
Are you the Filavandrel of the songs?

17:58.750 --> 18:02.916
The edge of the world?
The leader who rose against the lioness?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.750
The lying bard and his tunes.

18:07.833 --> 18:11.708
If I remember right, the bard's songs
claim that you were king of the elves.

18:13.791 --> 18:16.250
My people turned to Francesca
after I failed to beat Calanthe.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.291
They needed faith.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.791
Faith's a simple medicine
for desperate souls.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.833
Faith sustains us all in dark times.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.958
Your… seduction,

18:28.041 --> 18:31.625
whilst charming, it lacks
the cunning of your father's blood.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.625
Yes, well, he was half elf.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.708
I heard there hasn't been
a pure-blooded elf born in decades.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.708
We've dreamt of robed figures too.

18:43.916 --> 18:44.791
Guiding us.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.000
Hers is red. Mine is black.

18:50.875 --> 18:54.583
If you free us, perhaps we can work
together. Figure out their meaning.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.375
You've been digging here for how long?

19:01.375 --> 19:02.708
Perhaps we're the key.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.000
[elf shouts in Elder]

19:05.916 --> 19:07.958
-We've found something!
-[gasps]

19:08.916 --> 19:09.875
Close.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.041
Very close.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.500
It hides in forests?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.833
-There are others like it?
-A few.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.583
Dying out, though,
because they can't reproduce.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.375
Any you come across will have been around
since the Conjunction.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.833
So,
is that what we'll be doing here, then?

19:47.041 --> 19:48.166
Studying monsters.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.375
[grunts]

19:49.958 --> 19:50.791
Yeah.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.416
Collecting supplies
for those potions you take?

19:58.291 --> 19:59.125
Sure.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.083
Training?

20:05.750 --> 20:06.666
Training…

20:07.458 --> 20:08.666
is dangerous.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.041
So's the man with the black-winged helmet.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.166
And you want to kill him?

20:23.041 --> 20:23.875
Yes.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.333
Why?

20:28.166 --> 20:29.166
I hate him.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.166
[sighs]

20:39.750 --> 20:40.750
[sighs]

20:41.416 --> 20:42.666
This is important.

20:44.416 --> 20:46.041
We don't kill out of fear.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.625
We kill to save lives.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.583
Do you understand?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Hmm.

20:57.833 --> 21:01.250
Well, how did you spend your days
when you first came here?

21:01.333 --> 21:02.833
I was beaten and starved.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.416
How's your room?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.458
-It has rats.
-That's a good sign.

21:07.541 --> 21:08.708
-[crack]
-[grunts]

21:09.208 --> 21:11.166
Means it's one of the warm ones.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.000
[door opens]

21:15.083 --> 21:16.791
[men cheering outside]

21:18.416 --> 21:19.416
What's that?

21:21.083 --> 21:22.125
Stay here.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.375
-You know, in Cintra, I went to parties--
-Cirilla.

21:28.666 --> 21:29.916
[opens door]

21:30.000 --> 21:31.250
[door slams]

21:39.791 --> 21:41.750
[folk music playing]

21:41.833 --> 21:43.833
[cheering and laughter]

21:52.375 --> 21:55.041
[woman] Here's a good one!
Step over that bugle…

21:57.000 --> 22:00.875
So this is where witchers are hatched.

22:01.625 --> 22:04.750
I hope there's a plaque
to commemorate your greatness.

22:07.666 --> 22:09.875
Tavern outside Dorian,
handful of years ago.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.208
I bathed basilisk blood from your hair.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.000
[sighs]

22:16.500 --> 22:17.791
It was wyvern blood.

22:18.333 --> 22:19.666
You shouldn't be here.

22:19.750 --> 22:22.541
I hear that you have a daughter now.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.708
And I thought the softest thing
about you was that you paid.

22:27.375 --> 22:28.708
She's not my daughter.

22:29.375 --> 22:32.416
Oh. Well, in that case,
I could take her in.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.791
She'd have the boys
eating out of her hand-- Ooh! [giggles]

22:39.208 --> 22:41.125
And he says he's not a father.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.708
[loud cheering]

22:55.125 --> 22:56.250
[chuckling]

22:57.500 --> 22:58.333
What is this?

23:00.166 --> 23:02.833
[Vesemir] Eskel found some friends
down the mountain.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.833
They shouldn't be here.
And they should know better.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.333
He drank too much stramonium
for that sting, I reckon.

23:10.416 --> 23:11.791
-Here!
-[Vesemir] They all did.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.500
Get me another drink!

23:13.583 --> 23:16.083
[Vesemir] They won't remember anything
by tomorrow.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.333
Certainly not how they got here.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.791
[man] Wrong destination!

23:22.875 --> 23:24.291
[laughter and cheering]

23:32.291 --> 23:35.041
So one of my regular clients, a druid,

23:35.791 --> 23:38.916
he was telling me
leshies are giant talking trees.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.583
-[sighs]
-They're beautiful, too.

23:41.666 --> 23:42.500
[grunts]

23:43.125 --> 23:44.750
-We don't pay for talk.
-All right.

23:45.791 --> 23:46.708
Okay.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.958
Eskel, what are you doing?

23:54.625 --> 23:57.041
Are you takin' a break
from tuckin' in your girl?

23:58.333 --> 24:00.291
I understand that you're in pain,

24:00.791 --> 24:03.375
and you can drown that pain
with whomever you want.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.500
Just not here.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.083
[snorts]

24:08.166 --> 24:09.916
Aah, it's funny, you know.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.875
Me and the boys, we come back here,
all banged up.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.583
Rock troll bust Lambert's eye.

24:16.666 --> 24:19.833
A werewolf took a chunk
out of Coen's arse. Eh?

24:19.916 --> 24:21.500
And what do you come back with?

24:23.541 --> 24:24.583
All I say is,

24:25.333 --> 24:26.708
when I find a princess…

24:27.583 --> 24:28.583
[laughs]

24:28.666 --> 24:30.791
…the last thing I'm gonna do is…

24:31.541 --> 24:32.625
play knight.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.500
[grunts]

24:46.750 --> 24:47.583
Eskel.

24:48.916 --> 24:49.916
Go to bed.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Hmm?

24:54.125 --> 24:55.166
[panting]

25:05.708 --> 25:07.041
[bird screeches]

25:08.291 --> 25:09.541
We need a plan.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.791
-What is wrong with you?
-I feel off.

25:12.708 --> 25:13.958
The dimeritium.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.750
[elf] On your feet. Up!

25:16.250 --> 25:17.458
[sighs]

25:20.125 --> 25:21.250
Where are you taking us?

25:21.333 --> 25:24.625
You kill me, the White Flame
will hold no mercy hunting you down.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.000
Do you humans ever stop talking?

25:38.250 --> 25:42.208
-[Fringilla] What is this?
-[Yennefer] Runes of some sort. Linked by…

25:42.958 --> 25:43.791
Chaos?

25:45.833 --> 25:49.416
[Fringilla] This one's different.
The arrival of monsters.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.166
The Conjunction of the Spheres.

25:55.958 --> 25:58.208
The heavens roared
and the realms collided.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.291
Its survivors…

26:03.833 --> 26:06.125
lost and forsaken in a new world.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.416
New to you.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.375
It was ours.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.416
Your dreams. Tell me.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.875
Show us yours first.
This works both ways now.

26:20.166 --> 26:23.916
In my vision,
I'm lost in a maze of dead bodies,

26:24.458 --> 26:27.000
elves stacked so high they shade the sun.

26:29.291 --> 26:31.250
Ithlinne guides me clear the labyrinth,

26:31.333 --> 26:34.000
where I see the sun rise
on a new elven kingdom.

26:36.041 --> 26:38.583
My guide's not Ithlinne. It's Emhyr.

26:40.916 --> 26:42.666
I can't see him. He's hooded.

26:43.458 --> 26:46.458
He just returned to Nilfgaard.
He killed the Usurper.

26:47.541 --> 26:48.750
He saved me.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.833
And yours?

27:02.041 --> 27:03.000
What are you doing?

27:06.208 --> 27:07.875
[Yennefer blowing]

27:13.958 --> 27:16.375
It's Elder speech, but primitive.

27:17.625 --> 27:19.208
"Behold the mother of forests,

27:19.291 --> 27:22.166
the deathless mother, nesting in dreams."

27:24.416 --> 27:25.875
The rest is gibberish.

27:25.958 --> 27:28.041
No. It's an incantation.

27:28.541 --> 27:30.416
About a hut, with no doors.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.958
My father,
he used to scare us with stories

27:34.041 --> 27:35.750
about the witch in the woods,

27:36.708 --> 27:39.583
her home perched on basilisk legs.

27:40.083 --> 27:43.208
She would lure the children in
to be boiled and eaten.

27:43.291 --> 27:47.375
Wouldn't be the first time mankind
cried "witch" at the sight of elven power.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.750
My brother's right.

27:48.833 --> 27:52.000
These are our ancestors,
kneeling, worshiping.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.208
Perhaps this deathless mother's
one of the old gods.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.041
First you say it's Ithlinne,
then it's one of the old gods.

27:59.125 --> 28:01.333
What designs would either have
with two humans?

28:01.416 --> 28:03.125
[rumbling and cracking]

28:15.083 --> 28:17.583
[echoing whisper]
Turn your back to the forest.

28:18.416 --> 28:19.541
She's calling us.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.833
[distorted voices whispering]

28:21.916 --> 28:23.583
Stand guard until we've returned.

28:23.666 --> 28:24.750
-Francesca.
-No.

28:24.833 --> 28:28.250
Gage, I swore I'd take care of you
since we were children.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.500
Now let me take care of us all.

28:32.291 --> 28:33.333
[sighs]

28:36.208 --> 28:37.250
Do she and I get a vote

28:37.333 --> 28:39.750
-on joining your prayer circle?
-What do you think?

28:52.916 --> 28:54.916
[laughter and music from hall]

28:55.625 --> 28:56.750
[loud cheering]

29:15.375 --> 29:18.583
Newcomers always struggle sleeping
their first nights.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.750
It's the chill.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.541
Klef here was one of the first witchers.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.000
Before my time.

29:31.625 --> 29:32.875
What happened to him?

29:33.375 --> 29:35.500
One of the oldest monsters. A demon.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.250
Long extinct.

29:38.541 --> 29:43.375
She wreaked havoc until the witchers
bound her deep in the forest.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.166
That's what she used to kill him.

29:49.041 --> 29:52.458
Some say
she still calls to the unfortunate souls

29:52.541 --> 29:54.291
unlucky enough to cross her woods.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.875
Lures them in to devour them.

29:58.791 --> 30:01.083
Scary stories don't really work on me.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.458
And this one, Deglan,

30:07.541 --> 30:10.041
was killed by men right in these halls.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.041
He taught me everything I know.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.708
Made me a witcher.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.541
He was like a father to you, wasn't he?
As you're Geralt's.

30:21.750 --> 30:22.958
Something like that.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.375
It is easier when they're young.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.625
Wait for them
to finish crying for Ma and feed them,

30:29.708 --> 30:33.875
train them, send them out into the world,
and see who comes back alive.

30:39.166 --> 30:40.416
You don't frighten easily.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.458
There's times to stand still,
and there's times to keep moving.

30:45.541 --> 30:47.666
Did that mantra help you escape Cintra?

30:49.791 --> 30:51.458
Geralt said I'd be protected here.

30:51.541 --> 30:54.125
It's hard to do
when I don't know who I'm protecting.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.541
Or what I'm protecting her from.

31:01.416 --> 31:02.458
[woman gasps]

31:09.208 --> 31:11.250
You took on that wooden beast.

31:11.958 --> 31:13.541
Let me take on yours!

31:13.625 --> 31:14.708
Oh!

31:23.416 --> 31:25.166
[creaking]

31:26.333 --> 31:27.791
[woman moaning]

31:29.625 --> 31:31.291
[wind whistling]

31:36.083 --> 31:37.750
Come on. Keep moving.

31:43.250 --> 31:44.791
If you dreamt of Emhyr,

31:45.833 --> 31:47.833
why were you so terrified when you woke?

31:50.500 --> 31:51.375
Tell me.

31:55.541 --> 31:56.583
I'm in the dark.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.458
There are people over me…

32:00.291 --> 32:01.333
touching me.

32:02.166 --> 32:03.541
Just gentle taps.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.166
I can't see them. I can't stop them. So…

32:09.333 --> 32:11.000
I just lay there and let them.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.833
After the Usurper executed Fergus,

32:17.791 --> 32:19.958
he had all of the mages moved to a prison.

32:22.916 --> 32:23.958
Uh…

32:24.583 --> 32:25.541
A playhouse.

32:27.458 --> 32:30.500
I was there for years.
Then Emhyr found me.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.875
[voice hissing]

32:38.375 --> 32:40.250
[whispering voice] I could go walking…

32:41.625 --> 32:44.708
-[wind whistling]
-…if you were alive…

32:45.541 --> 32:46.791
A hut with no doors.

32:47.541 --> 32:49.083
-The inscription.
-[Yennefer] Wait.

32:50.583 --> 32:54.041
If you're wrong,
if the dreams don't mean what you think--

32:54.125 --> 32:58.000
Behold the mother of forests,
the deathless mother, nesting in dreams.

32:58.666 --> 33:01.625
-Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut.
-[rumbling]

33:02.458 --> 33:03.833
Turn your front to me,

33:04.500 --> 33:06.166
hut, hut.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.958
[echoing roar]

33:21.916 --> 33:23.500
[laughter]

33:23.583 --> 33:25.208
-Have you seen Cirilla?
-Yeah.

33:25.291 --> 33:28.041
I saw her pounding White Gull
and dancing on the table.

33:28.916 --> 33:29.958
-Funny.
-Mmm.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.500
I caught her spying.

33:36.583 --> 33:40.208
Geralt, it's her first night here.
What did you expect?

33:40.916 --> 33:42.791
I was hoping she'd do as I say.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.625
Kids never do what you say.

33:44.708 --> 33:45.708
Hmm.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.291
We had a chat, and then I sent her to bed.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.583
Are you sure you're ready for this?

33:56.375 --> 33:59.958
I was in a cell beneath the city
when Cintra was sacked.

34:00.583 --> 34:01.666
I heard it all.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.958
Fire, screams, and death.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.000
The same sounds
that I heard here as a boy,

34:09.916 --> 34:11.291
hiding in the cellar,

34:12.125 --> 34:14.375
waiting for the humans to come for us.

34:16.583 --> 34:20.125
You were the last surviving witcher
after Kaer Morhen fell.

34:21.416 --> 34:23.791
You and a batch of mutated orphans

34:24.791 --> 34:26.208
with nowhere else to go.

34:28.833 --> 34:29.666
Were you ready?

34:30.416 --> 34:31.333
No.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.125
But you protected us anyway.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.125
No.

34:34.916 --> 34:37.083
I taught you how to fend for yourselves.

34:39.416 --> 34:40.625
[chuckles]

34:41.125 --> 34:42.958
-[ringing]
-[chains rattling]

34:43.833 --> 34:45.916
[sighing sound echoes]

34:47.750 --> 34:49.166
[women gasping]

34:49.250 --> 34:50.125
-No!
-Hey!

34:50.958 --> 34:52.666
[high-pitched buzzing]

34:53.333 --> 34:54.625
[creaking]

34:55.416 --> 34:57.416
[skittering and rumbling]

34:58.583 --> 35:00.166
[heavy creaking]

35:00.250 --> 35:02.125
[pattering]

35:02.208 --> 35:04.125
Maybe Eskel's leshy wants its hand back.

35:04.208 --> 35:06.208
[pattering and creaking continue]

35:09.208 --> 35:10.666
Wield your wits, boys.

35:11.416 --> 35:13.166
-I'll secure the guests.
-I'll check the wing.

35:13.250 --> 35:16.625
-We'll check the perimeter.
-Follow me! Get a move on!

35:16.708 --> 35:18.041
-Let's go!
-[Lambert] Move it!

35:18.125 --> 35:19.833
-I'll find Cirilla.
-[Vesemir] No.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.916
Do what you do best.

35:22.958 --> 35:23.875
Stay and fight.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.250
[loud banging]

35:31.333 --> 35:33.375
-[gasps]
-Look alive, girl! We've got company.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.291
-What are you doing? Stay back.
-Hey!

35:35.791 --> 35:39.250
Don't barge into a girl's room
waving about a sword, you moron!

35:39.333 --> 35:42.541
-[gasping]
-Stand guard outside.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.416
I was following fucking orders.

35:46.083 --> 35:48.083
Come on, let's go! Move it!

35:51.958 --> 35:53.875
[water dripping]

35:54.375 --> 35:56.083
[creaking]

36:03.041 --> 36:04.333
[thump]

36:05.666 --> 36:07.333
[rumbling]

36:07.416 --> 36:08.875
[creaking]

36:17.416 --> 36:18.916
[creaking continues]

36:25.375 --> 36:26.833
Where are you?

36:30.083 --> 36:31.541
-[crashing]
-[screaming]

36:31.625 --> 36:32.958
[gasping]

36:33.041 --> 36:34.458
-[squeaking]
-[woman sobbing]

36:36.750 --> 36:38.750
[chittering and squelching]

36:41.958 --> 36:43.541
[rumbling]

36:54.125 --> 36:56.125
[whispering voices]

36:57.125 --> 36:58.916
-[wind whistling]
-[groans softly]

37:05.166 --> 37:07.083
[whispering voices overlapping]

37:21.041 --> 37:22.000
What are you?

37:23.541 --> 37:24.500
Hello.

37:27.666 --> 37:29.083
Don't be scared.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.666
I'm here to help you.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.333
Ithlinne?

37:35.000 --> 37:35.833
I knew it.

37:37.583 --> 37:38.791
You're not him.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.250
I know what you are.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.791
[Emhyr] An old wives' tale for children.

37:46.583 --> 37:48.250
Are you a child, Fringilla?

37:49.208 --> 37:52.333
Did I save you from the playhouse
to be a child?

37:54.291 --> 37:55.333
I'm not scared.

37:56.125 --> 37:57.500
And I don't do help.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.833
Yes, you don't need anyone.

38:01.291 --> 38:02.750
You have nothing to hide here.

38:02.833 --> 38:03.750
I know.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.208
It's just… the path has been hard.

38:06.291 --> 38:09.083
And the path forward will be harder still.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.916
[echoing] But I can help you.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.583
[voices hissing]

38:14.833 --> 38:15.666
And yet…

38:16.708 --> 38:18.541
you've stayed for decades.

38:20.208 --> 38:21.041
Why?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Is it love?

38:23.958 --> 38:25.375
Legacy, you say?

38:28.083 --> 38:28.916
Power!

38:29.625 --> 38:30.916
That's what you live for.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.833
[laughing] That's your play?
It's rather desperate.

38:33.916 --> 38:36.041
You're the desperate one, Yennefer.

38:36.541 --> 38:37.625
[distorted] The most.

38:44.625 --> 38:45.750
You are not the new sun.

38:46.916 --> 38:49.708
-You are not him.
-Oh, he'll never tell you what I will.

38:50.583 --> 38:54.291
The path to true strength
lies not in humble faith,

38:55.666 --> 38:57.291
but in believing in oneself…

38:57.375 --> 38:59.833
[Ithlinne, echoing]
…and seizing one's destiny.

39:02.416 --> 39:07.833
The world will die in frost
and be reborn with a new sun.

39:08.875 --> 39:12.208
But first, the earth will flow
with the blood of elves.

39:13.666 --> 39:15.083
How do I save them?

39:15.166 --> 39:16.583
Remove those robes.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.333
Or what if I told you
that you could have power?

39:22.166 --> 39:24.000
And not of a meek sycophant,

39:24.083 --> 39:25.750
but as your own woman.

39:25.833 --> 39:26.916
This isn't real.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.833
[Ithlinne] Well, imagine if it were.

39:31.416 --> 39:34.875
[Emhyr and Ithlinne] Imagine
that you are the emperor, right now.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.166
[girl] The others' dreams were obvious.

39:41.083 --> 39:42.916
You thought you were special.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.250
But no.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.166
Yours was obvious too.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.291
Then make your ask.

39:49.250 --> 39:50.875
I would rebuild our forces.

39:51.916 --> 39:53.291
Strengthen our numbers.

39:54.166 --> 39:58.166
We are an empire, but the North…
the North is a league of many kingdoms.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.916
[Emhyr and Ithlinne]
And a large and unpredictable land.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.583
[echoing] Even with numbers,
you'd be lost. You need friends.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.500
Allies that know this land
as if it were their own.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.750
No Northern Kingdom
would ally itself with us.

40:11.333 --> 40:12.916
-[whisper] No…
-No kingdom of men.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.750
Do you want salvation?

40:18.625 --> 40:22.833
[whispering] Then you're bringing back
the wrong elf.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.750
The first pure elf for years.

40:31.708 --> 40:34.000
A new hope for a brighter future.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.833
I've been with child before.

40:36.416 --> 40:37.500
None have come to term.

40:37.583 --> 40:38.666
But if it could?

40:39.166 --> 40:40.375
If I could help you?

40:41.041 --> 40:43.041
All you need to do is ask.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.000
You're not Ithlinne, are you?

40:47.083 --> 40:49.833
[distorted] Your ancestors' faith
was better than yours.

40:49.916 --> 40:51.875
[whispering echo] Better than yours.

40:51.958 --> 40:53.250
Then make your ask.

40:55.458 --> 40:56.375
What must I do?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.958
To see your child live,

41:00.750 --> 41:02.250
you must live first

41:02.833 --> 41:03.750
amongst men.

41:03.833 --> 41:05.666
[distorted ringing]

41:06.166 --> 41:07.291
Xintrea!

41:10.833 --> 41:12.208
[girl] You're no longer bound.

41:13.625 --> 41:15.916
Why haven't you thought
to portal yourself free?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.750
You've felt it since Sodden,

41:21.541 --> 41:22.416
haven't you?

41:23.875 --> 41:25.583
-[distorted] Or rather…
-[wind whistles]

41:25.666 --> 41:27.458
[girl and Ithlinne] …haven't felt it.

41:30.458 --> 41:33.583
But you'd rather be blind
than see the truth.

41:35.041 --> 41:37.041
Remember this lesson, Piglet?

41:39.208 --> 41:41.208
[wind gusting]

41:42.583 --> 41:43.916
[bird screeches]

41:44.750 --> 41:46.208
[distant crashing sounds]

41:50.875 --> 41:51.708
Zeilil eip.

41:54.208 --> 41:55.125
Zeilil eip.

41:57.875 --> 41:58.791
Zeilil eip.

42:00.291 --> 42:01.125
Zeilil eip.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.625
You blew it at Sodden.

42:04.208 --> 42:06.500
Fire is dangerous magic.

42:07.208 --> 42:08.416
Farewell, Chaos!

42:08.500 --> 42:10.291
What will she live for now?

42:11.791 --> 42:14.250
Zeilil eip. Zeilil eip.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.083
Move, damn it!

42:17.625 --> 42:19.041
Fucking parlor tricks!

42:19.125 --> 42:20.916
Yes, denial!

42:21.416 --> 42:23.625
[girl and Ithlinne] A tasty garnish.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.958
-I'm going to let you bake some more.
-[whispering echo]

42:40.000 --> 42:43.083
I want your desperation crisp.

42:45.583 --> 42:49.166
You will beg me to take it from you.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.958
And I will.

42:58.791 --> 43:00.791
[creaking]

43:04.083 --> 43:05.625
[liquid running]

43:13.541 --> 43:15.333
[soft creaking]

43:26.208 --> 43:27.125
[sighs]

43:27.208 --> 43:28.833
[creaking and rumbling]

43:36.291 --> 43:37.583
[sounds fade]

43:38.291 --> 43:39.625

43:41.125 --> 43:42.416

43:44.333 --> 43:46.083

44:13.291 --> 44:14.875
[Geralt straining]

44:19.000 --> 44:20.750

44:24.208 --> 44:26.083

44:27.625 --> 44:29.625
[gasping]

44:30.458 --> 44:31.791
[growls]

44:32.750 --> 44:33.666
Eskel?

44:33.750 --> 44:35.791
[panting] Geralt.

44:39.708 --> 44:41.416
[Eskel grunting]

44:45.125 --> 44:46.583

[roars]

45:16.000 --> 45:16.833
Eskel!

45:25.625 --> 45:27.666
I came… back here.

45:29.833 --> 45:31.375
I knew something…

45:32.083 --> 45:32.916
was wrong.

45:33.666 --> 45:35.916
-I don't know what happened.
-[groans]

45:37.500 --> 45:38.750
But I thought…

45:39.250 --> 45:40.916
I thought I could fight it.

45:42.416 --> 45:43.916
[groans]

45:45.166 --> 45:46.125
I thought…

45:46.916 --> 45:48.208
you could…

45:49.375 --> 45:50.416
help…

45:51.291 --> 45:52.333
me.

45:56.375 --> 45:57.791
[screeches]

45:58.375 --> 45:59.375
Vesemir.

46:05.333 --> 46:08.291
Should've known better than to bring
my whores to a witcher den.

46:08.375 --> 46:09.333
Danica, you fool.

46:10.291 --> 46:12.333
Stay here. Take cover.

46:12.916 --> 46:13.833
-[door slams]
-No.

46:14.375 --> 46:15.750
No, no, no. Lambert!

46:16.541 --> 46:19.916
Fuck this. I'm not dying here.
What's the quickest way out, girl?

46:20.000 --> 46:23.750
There's stairs to the north of the hall,
a turret to the south… I don't know.

46:23.833 --> 46:25.708
-All right, come on.
-No.

46:25.791 --> 46:28.666
-We have to stay. Geralt--
-Geralt may be dead already!

46:30.291 --> 46:32.916
-Look, witchers fight. We run.
-[rumbling]

46:33.000 --> 46:34.833
-[crashing]
-[gasping and screaming]

46:34.916 --> 46:36.291
Go. Go!

46:39.166 --> 46:41.000
-Go.
-[women crying]

46:45.875 --> 46:47.958
-[rumbling]
-What is this?

46:48.041 --> 46:49.041
It's Eskel.

46:49.666 --> 46:51.166
The leshy's infected him.

46:52.666 --> 46:53.875
That's not possible.

46:58.291 --> 46:59.458
-[creaking]
-[growls]

47:00.583 --> 47:01.875
[skittering]

47:03.958 --> 47:05.250
[clattering]

47:10.083 --> 47:11.208
[Geralt growls]

47:11.875 --> 47:12.750
[Eskel snarling]

47:15.375 --> 47:16.291
[Vesemir] The door! Go!

47:25.833 --> 47:26.916
[yells]

47:34.333 --> 47:35.541
[roaring]

47:42.708 --> 47:43.833
[screeches]

47:50.000 --> 47:50.833
Eskel.

47:51.541 --> 47:52.583
We need time.

47:53.333 --> 47:54.291
We can save you.

48:03.666 --> 48:04.916
[strained] Eskel…

48:07.750 --> 48:09.833
Please… stop…

48:09.916 --> 48:11.416
-[snarling]
-[whimpers]

48:19.625 --> 48:21.000
[Eskel screeches]

48:21.833 --> 48:22.916
[screams]

48:24.125 --> 48:25.625
[roaring]

48:29.833 --> 48:31.416
[gasping]

48:45.750 --> 48:47.583
[Vesemir sighs]

48:50.125 --> 48:51.333
[sighs]

48:54.833 --> 48:56.458
You did what you had to do.

48:59.666 --> 49:00.875
[sighs]

49:11.458 --> 49:12.958
[whimpering]

49:16.875 --> 49:18.375
[voices calling]

49:30.625 --> 49:31.583
There you are.

49:32.541 --> 49:33.458
It's all right.

49:36.625 --> 49:37.500
You saw her too.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.666
Don't worry. You're free.

49:42.458 --> 49:43.375
You're going with them.

49:44.166 --> 49:47.416
Francesca claims the old gods want
an alliance between elves and Nilfgaard.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.041
-I agreed.
-Then you're both fools.

49:51.166 --> 49:52.958
You know that evil witch is no god.

49:53.041 --> 49:55.208
I know my faith brought me this far.

49:55.291 --> 49:58.625
-I'll see how much further it can take me.
-That sounded like ambition.

49:58.708 --> 50:01.458
-Impossible.
-Not as impossible as you finding meaning.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.416
-What did you ask for?
-[horse neighs]

50:04.500 --> 50:06.791
-An end to this nonsense.
-Oh, glib as ever.

50:06.875 --> 50:07.791
Uh--

50:08.583 --> 50:09.875
If she really is that evil,

50:10.708 --> 50:12.208
why did she let you go?

50:13.333 --> 50:14.791
[elves shouting]

50:18.458 --> 50:20.458
[thunder crashing]

50:21.708 --> 50:23.083
[sobs]

50:30.541 --> 50:31.708
[rats squeaking]

50:37.333 --> 50:38.208
[door opens]

50:46.791 --> 50:48.083
[Geralt groans]

50:52.375 --> 50:53.375
Is it over?

50:54.958 --> 50:55.791
We're safe now?

51:03.125 --> 51:04.375
Are you okay?

51:06.250 --> 51:07.083
I'm all right.

51:10.416 --> 51:11.416
Come with me.

51:29.291 --> 51:31.500
When I first came to Kaer Morhen,

51:33.583 --> 51:36.958
Vesemir said to me
that the world outside these walls

51:38.125 --> 51:39.625
is a dangerous place.

51:42.416 --> 51:44.416
[thunderclap]

51:49.875 --> 51:51.708
[Geralt] But times are changing,

51:53.375 --> 51:54.208
even here.

51:56.083 --> 51:57.791
[high-pitched ringing]

51:58.625 --> 51:59.833
Nowhere's safe now.

51:59.916 --> 52:01.166
[shouting in Elder]

52:02.000 --> 52:02.833
[yelps]

52:02.916 --> 52:04.958
[Geralt] You can't run from the world.

52:06.375 --> 52:07.916
You can't hide from it.

52:09.208 --> 52:10.083
Eskel.

52:10.625 --> 52:12.208
-Eskel.
-For the brothers.

52:13.291 --> 52:15.791
But you can find power

52:16.500 --> 52:17.958
and purpose.

52:24.708 --> 52:27.208
A chance to survive the horror.

52:27.875 --> 52:29.458
[thunder crashing]

52:29.541 --> 52:31.291
[gasping and shouting in Elder]

52:34.416 --> 52:35.625
[gasps]

52:44.041 --> 52:45.416
[shouts in Elder]

52:47.000 --> 52:48.291
[gasps]

52:53.083 --> 52:54.666
[sobbing]

53:00.041 --> 53:01.750
[screaming]

53:07.916 --> 53:09.166
[sobbing]

53:12.125 --> 53:13.791
[Geralt] This Continent…

53:14.500 --> 53:15.875
was meant for no one.

53:17.833 --> 53:19.500
All you have to do, Ciri,

53:20.416 --> 53:22.166
is keep your sword close

53:22.708 --> 53:23.666
and keep moving.
