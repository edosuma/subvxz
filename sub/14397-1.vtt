you got a soft spot for this guy.

It's not easy for me
to talk about my father...

04:53.001 --> 04:56.628
...because, in a sense,
I'm talking about two people.

...and popular author known to millions

He was a psychotic,

I'm sorry. It's mine.
I have to take this.

Not a good time? Let me explain
something, I'm in fucking hell now.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.743
- This is not a good time.
- This is a very bad time. My father died.

from my notes a little bit.

that I got a call from Paul Vitti?

schizophreniform disorder.

- A day, a week, a month...

15:05.654 --> 15:08.072
...if the precipitating stresses
are removed.

somebody is trying to kill him.

where he's permanently schizophrenic.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.818
I see what you're doing, you.
I see. I get it.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.738
- What am I doing?
- You're pissing me off. That's what.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.365
Look at me. I'm starting to get anxious.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.243
It's very understandable
that you're anxious.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.455
You spent your whole life
becoming something that you were...

27:04.623 --> 27:07.416

so it's scary.

I mean, if you're not
Paul Vitti "the boss," who are you?

27:12.922 --> 27:14.089
Let me ask you this way.

27:14.549 --> 27:18.010
When you were a kid,
what did you want to be?

27:18.511 --> 27:22.306
- I was a kid. Who remembers that shit?
- But you had to want to be something.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.643
- Did you want to be a baseball player?
- No.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.520
- A fireman? An astronaut.
- Ah.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.690
Come on, what did you wanna be?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.904
- It was stupid.
- It's not stupid.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.657
- What, are you afraid to tell me?
- Yeah, I'm afraid.

27:39.824 --> 27:43.827
So tell me. I'm not here to judge you.
What did you want to be?

27:44.412 --> 27:48.957
There was one time
when I was about...

27:49.125 --> 27:53.962
...maybe 6, 6 and a half, 7.
Right in there. Right in that time.

I wanted to be a...

28:00.762 --> 28:03.138
For a second...
You know, a little kid.

28:03.306 --> 28:06.558
- What?
- Maybe... I was a kid, you know?

28:06.726 --> 28:08.268
Little kid.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.020
What?

28:10.522 --> 28:13.440
- Tell me.
- I wanted to be a cowboy.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.568
- A cowboy, really?
- Would you believe that?

28:16.736 --> 28:18.320
Well, that's interesting.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.530
How did that start?

28:20.740 --> 28:23.617
I was watching television
with my mother, father.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.537
You know, we watched
those cowboy shows.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.414
BEN: Uh-huh.
- And my...

28:31.334 --> 28:34.628
- My father got me the whole outfit.
- Uh-huh.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.797
He got me a 10-gallon white hat...

28:36.965 --> 28:39.967
...the boots, the spurs, the cap guns...

28:40.552 --> 28:42.511
...the whole bit.

28:42.679 --> 28:46.724
He took me upstate to my uncle's farm
and led me around on this little pony.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.894
And there was cows and all that stuff.
It was like, to me, the Wild West.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.982
And it was all "yippee kai-ay"
and all that stuff. You happy now?

28:56.192 --> 28:57.317
So, what happened?

28:58.820 --> 29:01.822
- I don't know. What happened?
- Why didn't you try to be a cowboy?

29:01.990 --> 29:05.534
I was in East Harlem. I joined
a street gang when I was 12 years old.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.327
"Why didn't I become a cowboy?"

29:07.495 --> 29:11.165
Something else happened when you
were 12 that was very difficult for you.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.041
Yeah.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.919
That's when your father was murdered.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.714
- Yeah, I think about it every day.
- Uh-huh.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.345
- What's that got to do with anything?
- It has a lot to do with things.

29:25.513 --> 29:29.892
It's very interesting because your father
was the one who got you the white hat.

29:30.810 --> 29:34.688
He was in the Mob,
but yet he wanted you to be a hero.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.567
Yeah, he did.

29:38.735 --> 29:41.403
Your father wanted you to have
a better life than he did.

29:41.571 --> 29:42.738
He did, yeah.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.867
He wanted me to go to college.
I didn't even go to high school, hardly.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.995
That's because he had died
and he wasn't around to guide you.

"I'm Paul Vitti, the boss"...

I see Paul Vitti the 12-year-old kid...

figure it out with my father. That's great.

round of drinks...

38:12.081 --> 38:14.874
...and more bread
when you get a chance? Thanks.

This stone is supposed to be a G color.
It looks a little yellow, doesn't it?

38:29.390 --> 38:32.434
That's the fluorescent light.

It makes everything look yellow.

38:34.687 --> 38:38.523
No, I thought fluorescent light
makes everything look blue.

That might help us out.

Do you have a lens?

39:07.595 --> 39:09.429

We just asked for a lens.

- Where am I going?

I'm going to Jelly's house.

No, you're not. You're in my custody.
And we have therapy to do.

I get. Look at me. I'm a fucking wreck.

No, the other one.

Let's talk about it.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.981
And you don't think
this dream is sexual?

40:02.149 --> 40:05.193
You think the sword is my cock,
I can't get it up. That ain't it.

40:05.361 --> 40:08.947
Because I was with Sheila last night,
I had a hard-on you could swing from.

40:09.115 --> 40:12.867

- You could hang wet towels on this one.

- So, what does it mean?
- Sex can mean a lot of things.

it's about performance anxiety.

Little Caesar?

The producer of the show
is a man named Raoul Berman.

A mutual friend told him I know you,
so Mr. Berman called me this morning...

He's meeting a television producer
who could give him a job.

He's very nervous about it, and he
asked me to buffer. I'm here to buffer.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.596
He's a grown man.
Why does he need a chaperone?

42:38.764 --> 42:42.892
He doesn't. He needs a buffer.
I'm here in a buffering capacity.

Raoul, what's very interesting about Paul
is that he was born without a filter.

He has no filter. He says whatever comes
through his mind. He never edits himself.

BEN: What?

43:43.120 --> 43:47.332

have had the mai tai or the sake.

I don't know who makes
these decisions...

50:33.780 --> 50:36.365
...but there are things that
I see that don't look right.

50:36.533 --> 50:39.702
Yes, I sensed this myself.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.455
Which elements strike you as wrong?

50:42.622 --> 50:45.875
Well, the people, mainly. I mean,
you got a boss who speaks Australian.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.128
- What the fuck is that about?
- Not my first choice.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.049
- And your background is what?
- Theater, mostly.

50:53.216 --> 50:56.135
That figures. I got some people
I could bring around...

50:56.303 --> 50:58.971
...that will add a certain authenticity
to the whole thing.

50:59.139 --> 51:02.475
I would be eternally grateful
to you if you could.

51:02.642 --> 51:05.644
Is there anything else
that you would need?

51:06.354 --> 51:08.647
I'd like one of those trailers
like the stars got.

Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm going nuts already with this job.

In a week, I'll fucking kill
this Raoul or I'll kill myself.

This is just a good cover till I figure out
what I'm gonna do. But call the guys.

What about this line? "Stevie Wonder
sees more shit than you do!"

the possibility of change.

turning him into a stroMboni.

the ice with at the hockey games?
