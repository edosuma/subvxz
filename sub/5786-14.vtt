00:00.710 --> 00:02.462
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:04.255
<i>- Who's Rita?</i>
<i>- She was meaningless.</i>

00:04.464 --> 00:07.384
He said
this desperate Rita chick
threw herself at him.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.344
Blaine is selling Utopium.
He's taking on Mr. Boss.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.720
Where to, boss?

00:10.929 --> 00:11.846
Boss' guys figured out
there's a rat.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.598
<i>You're gonna get me killed.</i>

00:13.807 --> 00:14.975
<i>This is us striking
while the iron is hot.</i>

00:15.183 --> 00:16.184
I never forget a face.

00:16.393 --> 00:17.852
<i>You owe me 80 grand.</i>

00:18.061 --> 00:19.521
<i>New Hope
died this afternoon.</i>

00:19.729 --> 00:20.981
<i>- So Major.</i>
<i>- And Blaine.</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:23.108
They're on borrowed time now.

00:23.316 --> 00:25.360
We'll be taking
that tainted Utopium
that we need to make the cure.

00:25.568 --> 00:29.155
We have two bodies
full of tainted Utopium
buried in a shallow grave.

00:29.364 --> 00:31.783
<i>Zombie cure,
here we come!</i>
Yay!

00:35.620 --> 00:40.458
Stomach acid ate through all
of the tainted Utopium-filled
condoms they swallowed,

00:40.667 --> 00:42.752
but luckily, one of them
had the good sense

00:42.961 --> 00:44.796
to stash these
in his prison wallet,

00:45.005 --> 00:46.881
allowing me
to salvage enough powder...

00:47.090 --> 00:49.926
- If not your dignity.
- ...to create more cure.

00:50.135 --> 00:52.429
Starting with this.

00:52.637 --> 00:56.182
The exact same formula as
the stuff Liv used on you
10 months ago.

00:56.391 --> 00:58.393
I've got it ready to go.
Just plug and play.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.520
Yeah, but now we know the
effects are only temporary.

01:00.729 --> 01:02.897
Yeah. Then it's reversion
to zombie state followed
by death.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.983
Still, it should keep you
human for a few months

01:05.191 --> 01:07.694
until I can properly
develop and test
version two of the cure.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.530
Hey, a couple of months
of not being a zombie
sounds good to me.

01:10.739 --> 01:11.781
I mean, no offense.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.199
I'm gonna take
a little offense.

01:14.826 --> 01:15.785
Sorry, not for you.

01:18.413 --> 01:20.165
He's gotta make sure
it's safe first.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.751
Uh, we've never used it
on a previously cured subject.

01:22.959 --> 01:23.918
Fortunately...

01:27.464 --> 01:28.631
We have the
perfect guinea pig.

01:38.391 --> 01:39.684
Great morning, Paul!

01:39.893 --> 01:41.019
Back at you, Leslie!

01:41.227 --> 01:43.855
Mmm, smells awesome, Ruth!

01:44.064 --> 01:46.066
Morning, Darcy.
What's our thought of the day?

01:46.274 --> 01:49.110
"We must become
the change we wish to see
in the world."

01:49.319 --> 01:51.362
- That's Gandhi.
- Your boss is Gandhi?

01:51.571 --> 01:53.114
No, the quote is Gandhi.

01:54.074 --> 01:55.658
I know that.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.577
Of course I know that.
I'm British.

01:57.786 --> 02:00.330
That manky old git cost us
the crown jewel of our empire.

02:02.874 --> 02:04.834
She just walked in.

02:05.043 --> 02:07.045
Morning, Cher! Happy Tuesday!

02:07.253 --> 02:08.630
Thanks, Mom.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.381
Did you see what somebody
left on the sidewalk?

02:10.590 --> 02:12.217
I'll get the pooper-scooper!

02:12.425 --> 02:13.718
No, it's chalk art.

02:13.927 --> 02:15.220
It's wonderful!

02:32.570 --> 02:33.530
Oh, my goodness.

02:34.072 --> 02:35.073
Mom?

02:35.281 --> 02:36.574
Oh, my God.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.940
Did you happen to catch
her last words?

03:09.149 --> 03:10.817
"I'll get the pooper-scooper!"

03:11.025 --> 03:12.944
Then, ker-splat.

03:13.153 --> 03:14.529
Maybe this is God's
way of saying,

03:14.737 --> 03:17.407
"Whoa, Seattle,
too much coffee."

03:17.615 --> 03:18.825
Not just any coffee.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.952
Positivities have
Seattle's best coffee,

03:21.161 --> 03:22.453
verified by
three straight titles

03:22.662 --> 03:24.372
in the local alt weekly
reader's poll.

03:24.581 --> 03:27.625
Served up by the city's
foxiest cashier.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.169
That part's simply
my personal opinion.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.005
You missed
a piece of sidewalk.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.340
Fiber.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.727
Mmm!

03:46.644 --> 03:47.812
Mmm?

03:48.021 --> 03:49.189
I'm good.

03:53.318 --> 03:54.736
What a mess.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.530
Poor thing.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.490
I choose to believe she's in
a better place now.

03:59.699 --> 04:01.242
Then under an air conditioner,
you mean.

04:01.451 --> 04:03.828
I'm talking about Shangri-La.
The Happy Hunting Grounds.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.123
Valhalla. The Great
Coffee Shop in the Sky.

04:07.332 --> 04:08.625
What's your notion
of Heaven, Clive?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.001
Just, you know, Heaven-heaven.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.669
Except in "Clive Heaven"

04:11.878 --> 04:13.588
things are a little bit
tougher than here on Earth.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.341
So, what brings you down here
on this beautiful morning?

04:16.549 --> 04:19.219
- It's raining.
- That's liquid sunshine,
my friend.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.512
Don't believe me?
Ask a farmer.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.681
- Or a duck.
- Or Gene Kelly.

04:23.890 --> 04:26.809
You ready to apply
that can-do spirit to the
murder of Leslie Morgan?

04:27.018 --> 04:28.394
So, it's definitely a murder?

04:28.603 --> 04:29.520
That air conditioner
didn't just fall on Leslie,

04:29.729 --> 04:31.564
it was pushed.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.107
Owner of the building says
someone pulled out
the limiter screws

04:33.316 --> 04:35.193
in the vacant apartment
above the coffee shop.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.528
The ones meant to keep
the AC unit in place.

04:37.737 --> 04:39.656
The real estate agent Gary...

04:40.740 --> 04:42.700
Derryberry

04:42.909 --> 04:44.786
- is meeting us there.
- Gary Derryberry?

04:46.204 --> 04:47.121
You know him?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.873
No, but he sounds like a hoot!

04:51.000 --> 04:52.543
Huh.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.295
The apartment's been empty
for a couple of months.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.381
The owner is asking
too much for it.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.674
Who else has access?

04:57.882 --> 04:59.133
Anyone with
a real estate license

04:59.342 --> 05:01.219
could look up the code,
get into the lockbox.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.096
Now, they're supposed to
let me know if they show it.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.893
I need a list of agents
and clients who've
viewed the place.

05:09.102 --> 05:11.729
Beautiful hardwood floors.

05:11.938 --> 05:14.065
All-new fixtures.
Brand new window AC.

05:14.274 --> 05:15.400
Well, it will have.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.735
Very airy, Gary Derryberry.

05:17.944 --> 05:19.904
Yeah, I see holes for
the limiter screws.

05:20.113 --> 05:21.447
They would've kept
the window closed tight

05:21.656 --> 05:23.658
on the AC unit to
prevent it from falling out.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.119
So, where are the screws?

05:27.412 --> 05:28.538
Do you smell something?

05:28.746 --> 05:30.790
Uh, it could be
the floor finish.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.500
Not unless you used
cannabis oil.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.505
Someone broke in.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.717
Cut themselves in the process.

05:42.093 --> 05:43.469
This blood is still wet.

05:46.431 --> 05:47.390
It leads over there.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.060
Wait here.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.361
The smell's getting stronger.

06:10.455 --> 06:11.622
A little privacy?

06:12.165 --> 06:13.374
You!

06:13.583 --> 06:14.667
You know this woman?

06:14.876 --> 06:15.960
Yeah. We spent
a weekend together.

06:16.169 --> 06:17.045
In jail.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.212
The Regina Sumner case?

06:18.421 --> 06:19.297
Hi, Pam.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.673
You don't know me.

06:20.882 --> 06:22.383
I do! I was on
the bunk above you.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.469
Well, anyway. I was in kind of
a rough place back then.

06:24.677 --> 06:27.138
So, we might have got off
to a rocky start.

06:27.347 --> 06:29.432
- I'm Liv.
- Okay. Pam.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.642
Let's climb out of there.
No sudden moves.

06:31.851 --> 06:34.520
I see your big ol' gun,
but no body camera.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.315
Guess that's just the way
it's gonna go down, huh?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.817
Are you aware
you're trespassing
on a crime scene?

06:40.026 --> 06:41.486
Hell, yeah, I'm aware.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.529
I'm surprised you know
it's a crime scene.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.740
They want you to believe
it was an accident.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.367
That gravity killed Leslie.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.369
But not me. I'm not buyin' it.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.914
My boss was murdered.
And that woman made me
what I am today.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.333
A pot-smokin' break-in artist?

06:55.541 --> 06:56.834
Hey, that's reductive, man.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.836
'Cause I was here
huntin' for clues.

06:59.045 --> 07:01.589
I just took a little break
for a little pain relief.

07:01.798 --> 07:03.007
You worked for Leslie Morgan?

07:03.216 --> 07:04.384
I loved Leslie.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.219
That woman believed
in second chances.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.637
Where were you at
8:30 this morning?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.597
It's my day off.
So, home in bed.

07:09.806 --> 07:11.224
Can anyone verify that?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.226
I'm currently between lovers.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.852
Could you ask her
about the old fixtures?

07:15.061 --> 07:16.562
They went missing
a few weeks ago.

07:16.771 --> 07:18.981
I didn't steal
your damn fixtures,
you hear me?

07:21.192 --> 07:24.028
<i>I said I didn't steal
no damn money from
the cash register!</i>

07:24.237 --> 07:25.321
<i>Don't you touch me!</i>

07:28.074 --> 07:31.285
You keep making
slanderous accusations
and I will sue your ass!

07:31.494 --> 07:33.079
I just had a vision.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.207
It looks like Pam here stole
from the coffee shop register.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.252
And she reacted to Leslie
in a way that some might
deem aggressive.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.851
I don't care
if you are a brother.

07:55.059 --> 07:56.352
The missing window screws.

07:56.561 --> 07:57.687
Best guess?

07:57.895 --> 07:59.063
Our friend here tried
to flush 'em.

07:59.272 --> 08:00.481
Pam?

08:00.690 --> 08:02.984
No. She loved Leslie.
She just said so.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.735
We'll put her on ice
for a little while.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.572
At least until we talk
to her coworkers.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.616
Ma'am, I'm arresting you
for breaking and entering.

08:10.825 --> 08:14.537
Your lips are movin',
but it's the system talkin'!

08:23.921 --> 08:25.590
Hey, buddy. What's up?

08:25.798 --> 08:27.425
You know, saving the world.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.343
Oh! Don't let me interrupt.

08:30.261 --> 08:31.679
Or slow you down.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.476
Is this how it's gonna be now?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.644
Now, imagine how put out
the guy who invented

08:38.853 --> 08:40.938
the polio vaccine
must've been.

08:41.147 --> 08:44.192
You know, what with all
the impatient children dying
of polio stacking up.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.902
Jonas Salk is the man's name.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.821
Perhaps if he'd scored
a touchback for the Huskers.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.990
Or a touchdown
for the Huskies.

08:53.784 --> 08:57.330
I suppose our test subject
is due for a look-see.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.957
I should remind you,
it's only been a day
since I injected her.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.751
We may not see any
results for a while.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.879
Science is a marathon,
not a sprint.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.298
Yeah, sorry.
You know, it's just my life.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.926
It's not like whatever happens
to this rat happens to me.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.511
Oh! Hey!

09:11.719 --> 09:14.514
Maybe he's grown wings
and like super powerful...

09:15.848 --> 09:16.807
Balls.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.951
So, the
prognosis for me is, uh...

09:45.628 --> 09:47.505
The McDermotts,
together in life,

09:47.713 --> 09:50.508
until its tragic end
on State Route 520,

09:50.716 --> 09:54.136
shall be united in eternity
in their custom-order
double casket.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.098
I'm betting they were
the kind of couple

09:57.265 --> 10:00.059
that finished
each others' sentences.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.979
Ordered one dessert
and shared it with
a single fork.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.230
Yeah.

10:09.402 --> 10:12.280
Go tell Chief to make
sure the hearse's shock
absorbers can handle it.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.452
- Can I help you?
- I work for Mr. Boss.

10:18.661 --> 10:19.787
I believe you have
something for me.

10:25.042 --> 10:28.546
Fifteen more payments
and you're free and clear.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.548
I'm not sure I ever
want it to end

10:30.756 --> 10:33.593
if it means not having
these moments together,
you know?

10:34.969 --> 10:36.596
I remember you.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.014
Same old lip.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.515
Blessing and a curse.

10:42.435 --> 10:44.770
See you in a couple
of weeks, Chinatown.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.792
Hi! Welcome to Positivity.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.961
What can I get for you
this amazing morning?

11:09.170 --> 11:10.755
I'm Detective Babineaux,
Seattle P.D.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.090
I'm Dr. Moore, with
the medical examiner's office.

11:13.299 --> 11:15.468
Oh, you must know Ravi.
He's one of my favorites.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.053
Isn't he just the best?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.262
Could we speak
to your manager?

11:18.471 --> 11:19.889
I'm a manager.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.141
Everyone who works here is.
We're all co-managers.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.976
- Amazing.
- Uh, okay.

11:24.185 --> 11:26.937
Oh, look, Clive,
they're collecting money
to get Pam out of jail.

11:27.146 --> 11:28.856
Pam would never hurt Leslie.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.150
It's not just me saying that.
So is the money in the jar.

11:31.359 --> 11:32.318
The jar is half-empty.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.196
It's half-full.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.448
You know, we're having
a memorial for her here
tonight.

11:37.657 --> 11:40.326
You should come.
You could meet all the
people that Leslie touched.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.787
She made a point of hiring
the less-advantaged

11:42.995 --> 11:44.455
so that they could have
a second chance

11:44.664 --> 11:45.831
or even a third chance.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.291
How many chances did Pam get?

11:47.500 --> 11:48.417
Lots.

11:48.626 --> 11:50.795
But Leslie never
gave up on her

11:51.003 --> 11:53.130
and always insisted
that Pam work the register,

11:53.339 --> 11:55.800
even when money would
go missing during her shifts.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.260
So we know Pam was
stealing and we know
she could be violent.

11:58.469 --> 12:00.888
Pam didn't kill Leslie.
She adored Leslie.

12:01.097 --> 12:03.349
If you want to talk to someone
who wanted Leslie dead,

12:03.557 --> 12:04.475
then you need to talk
to the guy

12:04.684 --> 12:05.976
who used to be her partner.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.228
In business and life.

12:07.395 --> 12:08.521
Where will we find
this person?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.481
He owns the coffee place
across the street.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.900
He just tried to sue Leslie
and he lost.

12:13.109 --> 12:14.193
Why was he suing her?

12:27.248 --> 12:28.207
Yeah?

12:29.709 --> 12:30.918
We're in <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

12:31.502 --> 12:32.753
Next!

12:32.962 --> 12:35.256
Easy, sunshine.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.632
Could we speak
to the owner, please?

12:36.841 --> 12:37.758
Stan!

12:39.510 --> 12:43.055
Yeah, it's such a mystery
why I sued her.

12:43.264 --> 12:45.099
She stole my business.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.727
The layout, roasting
and brewing methods,
the menu, everything.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.354
- So, those "Best in Seattle"
awards are yours?
- Yep.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.773
But Leslie's place
has won that award
for the past three years.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.734
- What happened?
- People are morons.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.318
I think people are great.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.530
Seattle's Daily Grind uses
the same exact coffee.

12:59.739 --> 13:01.240
Same beans, same methods.

13:01.449 --> 13:02.867
You know what
the difference is?

13:03.075 --> 13:04.493
They draw
a little flower in the foam.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.203
I love those flowers!

13:06.412 --> 13:08.247
You get your drinks faster
because we don't draw in it.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.082
Ooh. Fast is good, too.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.667
You and Leslie were
together how long?

13:11.876 --> 13:12.918
Almost 10 years.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.712
Didn't believe in soul mates.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.464
We thought that was ridiculous
and yet that's what we were.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.716
Until she saw that commercial
for The Beacon Forum.

13:18.924 --> 13:19.925
"The Beacon Forum"?

13:20.134 --> 13:21.302
It's a human
potential seminar.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.762
One weekend
at some airport hotel,

13:22.970 --> 13:23.971
all of a sudden
she wants to get rid of

13:24.138 --> 13:25.639
all the negativity
in her life.

13:26.724 --> 13:28.100
Starting with me.

13:28.309 --> 13:30.269
My note says that Leslie
had a daughter.

13:30.478 --> 13:31.645
Is that your daughter as well?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.814
Cher is Leslie's,
from before we met.

13:34.023 --> 13:37.234
She's a smart cookie.
Like Leslie was before
The Beacon Forum.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.944
Where were you at 8:30
yesterday morning?

13:39.153 --> 13:40.488
Um...

13:40.696 --> 13:44.617
I took my dog to
the Poochmore Day Care Center.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.661
At 8:30, I was on my way here,

13:47.870 --> 13:49.038
uh, stuck in traffic.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.289
Can anyone vouch for that?

13:51.832 --> 13:52.792
No.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.795
I could never kill Leslie.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.713
Talk to Cher.
She'll vouch for me.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.100
- Terrell Johnson.
He's taken care of?
- Yep.

14:11.769 --> 14:13.938
I remember my first.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.941
It went so smooth,
like filling out a 1040A.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.693
Afterwards, I treated
myself to a steak.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.613
Double cut. Medium rare.
It's a nice tradition.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.617
I was, uh, I was gonna
go out with my boys.

14:26.826 --> 14:28.494
Shoot some pool.
If you don't need me.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.037
Go.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.877
New stop, the funeral home.

14:37.086 --> 14:38.504
You know the guy there
used to work for us?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.298
Yeah. He's payin' off
some old debts.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.466
Remember his nickname?

14:44.009 --> 14:46.053
- No.
- Chinatown.

14:46.262 --> 14:48.264
'Cause you gave him
a corner right in the middle

14:48.472 --> 14:50.140
of the Blue Cobras' territory,
told him it was his
if he could hold it.

14:50.349 --> 14:51.851
In Chinatown. Got it.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.143
Great story.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.104
No. That's not how
he got his name.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.356
He got it from the way
he took the corner.

14:57.565 --> 14:59.692
He recruited these two
'roided-up Asian dudes
from the gym

14:59.900 --> 15:02.069
and put Blue Cobra
tattoos on 'em.

15:02.278 --> 15:04.280
Had 'em grab the beat cop
that worked that corner.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.949
They sliced open his nostril
like Nicholson's.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.536
In <i>Chinatown.</i>

15:10.744 --> 15:13.664
Yeah. After that the
cops cracked down
on the Blue Cobras.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.291
It's like they were
working for us.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.960
Huh...

15:18.168 --> 15:20.462
And now it's like
the D.A.'s office is
working for Blaine.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.134
Son of a bitch.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.677
Something I can do, boss?

15:28.429 --> 15:29.889
Yeah.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.308
Book me a table
at American Angus.

15:40.900 --> 15:41.984
Good evening, everyone.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.486
Or as Leslie would say,
"great evening."

15:44.695 --> 15:47.907
Darcy said I was her
favorite customer.
You're sure about that?

15:48.115 --> 15:49.366
Might've been
"one of" her favorites.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.327
But she's your destiny, Ravi.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.120
I can feel it.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.455
Little test here, Liv.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.248
Jennifer Lawrence.
In my league?

15:56.457 --> 15:58.292
She'd be lucky to have you.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.960
Of course she would.

- There's the daughter.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.665
I was worried when I
didn't see you this morning.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.751
How's Ravi gonna survive

17:37.891 --> 17:39.727
Everyone loved my mom.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.270
We spoke to Stan.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.105
I guess some people
preferred your mom

17:43.313 --> 17:45.607
before she went to
The Beacon Forum seminar.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.317
That's when she
started being so positive.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.902
All the time.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.988
Could definitely drive
a normal person nuts.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.283
Drove me nuts sometimes,
but I still loved her.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.202
Stan said that your mom
stole all his ideas.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.164
That she basically
duplicated The Daily Grind
to start this place.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.583
Those ideas were every bit
as much hers as Stan's.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.752
Even a jury agreed.

18:04.960 --> 18:09.089
Do you think Stan
was upset enough about
losing the case to hurt her?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.841
There was a time
when I couldn't imagine it,

18:11.050 --> 18:13.635
but the lawsuit got so ugly.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.180
And when Positivity took over
as Seattle's top coffee shop,

18:16.388 --> 18:18.015
it ruined his plans.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.601
- What plans?
- He was gonna open
franchises nationwide.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.436

none of his backers
wanted to put their money

21:40.676 --> 21:43.553
When my mom was killed.
You rushed to her body.

21:43.762 --> 21:45.722
Everybody else froze,
but you tried to help.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.600
Oh, you saw it happen?

21:48.809 --> 21:50.352
Yeah.
I was sitting right there.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.646
On my phone.

21:52.854 --> 21:55.357
My last words to her were,
"Did you see what somebody
left on the sidewalk?"

21:59.528 --> 22:00.904
And who were you talking to?

22:01.863 --> 22:02.823
At the time.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.702
If we wanted confirmation.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.203
Are you asking for my alibi?

22:09.705 --> 22:12.291
Oh, we could check
the phone records, so...

22:12.499 --> 22:13.542
She was talking to me.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.252
I heard the screaming.
It was...

22:16.795 --> 22:19.381
- Was horrible.
- And where were you, Gilbert?

22:19.589 --> 22:20.882
- He was in Bellevue.
- At work.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.592
- And you work where?
- Lightfoot-Plummer.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.970
- And your supervisor is...
- Denise.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.556
Any plans to move to Paris?

22:27.764 --> 22:29.558
Once the inheritance
money rolls in.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.727
People say it's beautiful!

22:31.935 --> 22:33.520
Please, why are
you hassling her?

22:36.565 --> 22:38.191
You should be arresting Stan.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.401
Your boss is rude.

22:41.695 --> 22:44.072
He has lots of other
great qualities, though, too.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.243
He's tall.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.162
I may have gone overboard.
Sorry.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.581
You were just doing
what you thought was best.

22:55.959 --> 22:59.546
You do realize
Leslie was murdered.
So someone had to do it.

22:59.713 --> 23:03.133
And Cher needing money
so she could move to Paris
certainly gives her motive.

23:03.342 --> 23:05.093
You didn't hold Cher
in your arms

23:05.302 --> 23:07.095
as she wept for her mother.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.431
And what about the boyfriend?

23:09.639 --> 23:12.601
- Did he work up tears, too?
- No.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.355
But like I said,
he was 10 miles away,
in Bellevue at the time.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.984
At Lightfoot Plumbers, huh?

23:21.193 --> 23:22.986
All right,
I'll check out his alibi.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.113
And I'll see what's up
with Leslie's will.

23:25.322 --> 23:29.159
If money's the motive,
you might want to take
another look at Stan.

23:29.368 --> 23:32.746
Cher said he was trying
to franchise The Daily Grind.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.123
Lined up millions
in financing,
which fell apart

23:35.332 --> 23:37.376
when Positivity stole
his shop's thunder.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.796
His financing
sounds as shaky as his
doggie day care alibi.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.548
The Poochmore said he
dropped his dog off at 7:30.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.883
At 8:30,
the time of the murder,

23:45.092 --> 23:46.301
he said he was
still in his car.

23:46.510 --> 23:48.053
I checked traffic reports.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.930
There's no way
it should've taken him
an hour to get to work.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.516
Hey, your real estate guy
dropped this off.

23:52.724 --> 23:53.934
Oh, thanks, Cavanaugh.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.188
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.940
Stan Mendoza's on
a list of people

24:00.148 --> 24:01.608
who checked out
that apartment.

24:01.817 --> 24:03.068
He could've seen the agent
punch in the lockbox code,

24:03.276 --> 24:04.694
then gone back there any time.

24:04.903 --> 24:06.905
Let's go get
some...decent coffee.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.327
That's the apartment
that the AC unit fell out of?

24:12.536 --> 24:14.162
It was pushed out.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.581
Oh. Yeah, I looked at it.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.166
As well as 10 or so
other apartments

24:18.375 --> 24:19.501
in the neighborhood. I...

24:19.709 --> 24:21.253
I wanted a shorter commute.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.630
Yeah, your half hour
commute from Green Lake
is a real bear.

24:23.839 --> 24:27.259
How it could've taken
you an hour on a day
with no traffic is beyond me.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.387
And we also know about
how Positivity's success

24:30.595 --> 24:32.264
ruined your plans
to franchise.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.308
You spoke to Cher.

24:38.937 --> 24:40.689
Okay, I have an alibi.

24:40.897 --> 24:41.815
Good!

24:43.650 --> 24:46.820
That morning,
on my drive into work,

24:47.028 --> 24:49.239
I started experiencing
internal issues.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.743
A code brown.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.704
I pulled into a gas station

24:55.912 --> 24:59.708
and I spent 45 minutes
in the men's room.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.877
- Do you remember the station?
- Yes.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.712
And don't worry.
They'll remember me.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.130
They were out of toilet paper.

25:07.299 --> 25:08.258
I had to improvise.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.387
Okay, thanks.
You've been very helpful.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.890
Sorry about your bathroom.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.725
No, I don't need
security footage.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.018
All right. Bye.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.068
<i>Lightfoot-Plummer,
Denise Lightfoot speaking.</i>

25:27.277 --> 25:29.863
This is Clive Babineaux with
the Seattle Police Department.

25:30.071 --> 25:33.909
I'm calling to confirm
some information from
a Jill Bear, Lam Bear.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.535
<i>It's Gilbert Lambert.</i>

25:36.411 --> 25:37.412
<i>He's my son.</i>

25:39.206 --> 25:40.290
So he's not French?

25:40.499 --> 25:42.292
<i>No.</i>
<i>He wishes.</i>

25:42.501 --> 25:44.586
<i>He's never been east of Boise.</i>

25:44.794 --> 25:47.088
<i>Did another restaurant
complain about him refusing
to put out his damn cigarette?</i>

25:47.297 --> 25:49.090
I'm just calling to confirm
whether he was working for you

25:49.299 --> 25:51.718
in Bellevue on Tuesday
around 8:30 a.m.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.136
<i>Tuesday? Uh, yeah.</i>

25:53.345 --> 25:55.263
<i>He was putting up signs
for me all morning.</i>

25:55.472 --> 25:57.390
- What kind of signs?
<i>- Open house signs.</i>

25:57.599 --> 25:59.351
- You're not a plumber?
<i>- No.</i>

25:59.559 --> 26:01.895
<i>David Plummer is my partner.
We're a realty office.</i>

26:04.022 --> 26:05.649
Gilbert works for his mother.

26:05.857 --> 26:06.816
She's a real estate agent.

26:09.277 --> 26:12.197
At the time in question,
did you actually have
your eyes on Gilbert?

26:12.405 --> 26:14.574
<i>Should we be
talking to a lawyer?</i>

26:14.783 --> 26:16.076
<i>What has that girl
gotten him into?</i>

26:28.630 --> 26:29.881
- Drake.
<i>- Hey, babe.</i>

26:30.090 --> 26:31.633
Listen, I'm hate
to do this to you again,

26:31.841 --> 26:33.176
but tonight's
not looking good.

26:33.385 --> 26:34.636
No worries.
Is everything okay?

26:34.844 --> 26:35.762
You sound stressed.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.514
No. No. Everything's great.

26:37.722 --> 26:38.682
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

26:39.474 --> 26:40.976
Your place.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.185
- Bye.
<i>- Toodle-oo.</i>

26:50.485 --> 26:55.574
What can you tell us about
this other Mr. Boss guy,
Kenny Kill More?

26:55.782 --> 26:58.118
He's one of Mr. Boss'
regular trigger men.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.661
I've heard about lots
of stuff he's done,

26:59.869 --> 27:01.162
but I've never
witnessed it myself.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.000
What about you?

27:11.548 --> 27:14.426
Is there anything else
we can do to help
maintain your cover?

27:16.595 --> 27:17.846
I can't think of anything.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.472
I can.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.149
Ah!

27:29.357 --> 27:31.276
That gonna leave one hell
of a convincing bruise.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.611
Thank you.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.157
What've you
got in there, young buck?

27:37.365 --> 27:39.326
Your jaw made of concrete?

27:39.534 --> 27:41.161
Just flesh and bone, man.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.829
It's figurative language,
partner.

27:43.038 --> 27:44.289
Terrell Johnson make it
to the safe house?

27:44.497 --> 27:46.291
Yeah.
He's WITSEC's problem now.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.543
Mr. Boss thinks I killed him.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.503
If there's a leak anywhere,
I'm a dead man.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.464
So, it's still
kinda my problem.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.300
Mr. Boss have any idea
who's moving in on his
Utopium trade?

27:55.884 --> 27:57.052
No.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.803
- Do we?
- No.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.347
They're covering their tracks.
It's like chasing a ghost.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.349
If ghosts were real.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.142
The analogy works
either way.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.228
Our C.I.'s will come through.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.397
We'll find this new player.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.149
Well, since you're
the only agent we've got

28:11.358 --> 28:13.568
inside Mr. Boss' inner circle,

28:15.612 --> 28:17.364
why don't we just go over
everything you know?

28:26.831 --> 28:29.167
- This one's off, too.
- Are you sure?

28:29.376 --> 28:32.253
What'd you do?
Did you leave the case
in your trunk for a month?

28:32.462 --> 28:34.381
Mmm, I don't think so.

28:34.589 --> 28:35.590
I think there's another
full bottle in here.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.008
Maybe it'll be okay.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.847
Candy?

28:43.056 --> 28:44.766
Where's your
trivia genie costume?

28:47.060 --> 28:48.019
In my car.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.230
Get it.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.566
Daddy wants to play.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.861
Uh, it turns out
you weren't in Bellevue
at the time of the murder.

28:57.070 --> 29:00.156
Cell tower records show
you were in downtown Seattle.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.658
In a zone that includes
the apartment

29:01.866 --> 29:03.410
that air conditioner
fell from.

29:03.618 --> 29:05.036
An apartment you could enter

29:05.245 --> 29:08.623
by using your real estate
agent mom's access code.

29:08.832 --> 29:11.710
With Leslie gone,
you get to move to Paris.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.169
Live off
your girlfriend's inheritance.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.088
Play the same clubs as...

29:15.296 --> 29:16.381
Jacques Dutronc.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.967
No way, man.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.178
- I didn't do it.
- Pardon my French, Gilbert.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.097
But your ass is grass.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.850
"A work of art
is a confession."

29:27.058 --> 29:28.935
- You know who said that?
- Albert Camus.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.312
A French literary rock star.

29:31.521 --> 29:33.648
- He was Algerian.
- Of French descent.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.400
Work with me.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.277
The point is, he understood

29:37.485 --> 29:39.237
that a great artist
shows us the truth.

29:40.739 --> 29:42.449
Confess

29:42.657 --> 29:44.659
and be the artist
you were meant to be.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.870
Or confess, because
you'll get out of prison

29:47.078 --> 29:49.247
with enough time to
make something, well,

29:49.456 --> 29:50.749
positive out of your life.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.292
I don't think
it was your idea.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.085
I think Cher
talked you into it.

29:55.628 --> 29:56.629
You should be splitting
those years.

29:56.796 --> 29:57.922
You shouldn't be serving
all of them.

29:58.715 --> 29:59.674
But...

30:00.467 --> 30:01.551
I love her.

30:02.802 --> 30:03.803
So much.

30:05.472 --> 30:06.639
And she loves me.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.059
If she loved you,

30:10.268 --> 30:12.103
would she have
asked you to do this?

30:15.398 --> 30:18.318
Our forensics unit
is sweeping the apartment.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.278
They just need
one strand of DNA.

30:20.487 --> 30:21.821
One hair,

30:22.030 --> 30:23.823
a piece of skin,
a drop of sweat.

30:24.032 --> 30:28.161
And when we find it,
your chance at a deal
is off the table.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.829
I'll need a moment
with my client.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.790
In private.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.545
You think he's gonna
roll on Cher?

30:38.463 --> 30:40.089
I'm optimistic.

30:40.298 --> 30:41.466
No argument there.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.098
Talk to me, Counselor.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.392
If the D.A.'s office
guarantees us a 20-year max,

30:51.601 --> 30:54.395
my client is prepared to make
a full confession.

30:54.604 --> 30:57.607
One that not only
details his involvement in
the murder of Leslie Morgan,

30:57.816 --> 30:59.025
but also covers the testimony

30:59.234 --> 31:00.944
he'd be willing to
offer against Cher.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.697
I sent a couple of unis
to pick up Cher.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.325
I hope she didn't hear
we had Gilbert and
try to split town.

31:08.701 --> 31:09.702
Yo!

31:09.911 --> 31:11.079
Hey, man!

31:12.163 --> 31:13.122
Get the hell off!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.542
Want to take me to jail?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.794
- You want to take me to jail?
- Settle down.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.838
Hey!

31:21.089 --> 31:22.048
No, man!

31:22.715 --> 31:24.050
Hey! Hey!

31:28.471 --> 31:31.558
No. No, no. No!

31:31.766 --> 31:32.767
No, no, no, no!

31:32.976 --> 31:34.227
Hey, break it up.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.441
I lied.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.819
I did it alone. She had
nothing to do with it.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.865
Come on!

31:47.073 --> 31:48.825
Hey, which one of you
was supposed to be
guarding this man?

31:49.033 --> 31:50.243
I was.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.536
Look, I only turned
my back for a second

31:51.744 --> 31:53.413
to help Officer Tate.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.497
Now that you done helping him,

31:54.706 --> 31:55.957
take this one to
county lockup.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.257
What did you say to Gilbert?

32:06.092 --> 32:07.343
Just that I loved him.

32:07.552 --> 32:09.220
And now he wants to take
the fall to protect you.

32:11.723 --> 32:14.017
Something that body snatcher
that replaced my mom

32:14.225 --> 32:16.394
after The Beacon Forum
never understood.

32:18.146 --> 32:20.064
Love makes you stupid.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.824
I think that covers
the latest Mr. Boss intel.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.284
Right, well,
if you forgot anything,

32:31.492 --> 32:33.369
just haul me in,
cold-cock me,
and we'll talk.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.038
Cold what you?

32:35.246 --> 32:37.874
I'm not falling for it, man.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.626
There is one more thing.

32:39.834 --> 32:44.297
Photos of you
walking into the station
on several occasions.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.215
Yeah. So?

32:46.424 --> 32:48.176
Come on. We know you've been
seeing that gal in the morgue.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.803
It's a dumb move, man!

32:51.012 --> 32:53.514
When you're undercover,
you can't risk having
any girlfriend,

32:53.723 --> 32:55.308
much less someone
who works here.

32:56.893 --> 32:57.852
You got to end it with her.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.437
<i>- Pronto.
- Muy pronto.</i>

33:00.521 --> 33:01.606
Not a chance.

33:01.814 --> 33:02.982
It's taken us
a year and a half

33:03.191 --> 33:04.275
to get you this close
to Mr. Boss.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.402
Don't jeopardize that!

33:06.611 --> 33:09.822
You know, this girl's the one
good thing I got in my life.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.450
This job has taken
everything else.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.453
It's not taking her.

33:15.662 --> 33:16.788
That's a pretty good
ass-shot of me.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.456
Feel free to hang it
in your locker.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.461
Cover up my David Cassidy?

33:24.337 --> 33:25.463
Doubt it.

33:25.672 --> 33:30.009
<i>♪ And so it was</i>

33:30.218 --> 33:32.845
<i>♪ That later</i>

33:35.014 --> 33:38.768
<i>♪ As the miller told his tale</i>

33:41.145 --> 33:45.650
<i>♪ That her face
at first just ghostly</i>

33:45.858 --> 33:48.945
<i>♪ Turned a whiter</i>

33:49.153 --> 33:51.864
<i>♪ Shade of pale ♪</i>

34:13.136 --> 34:14.637
Forget it, Blaine.

34:14.846 --> 34:15.972
It's Chinatown.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.198
I hear you're
a Procol Harum fan.

34:34.407 --> 34:36.951
I never cared for
that psychedelic
pseudo-mystical stuff.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.619
More of
a British Invasion guy.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.580
Let's go back
to my place, man.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.331
I'll play you anything
you want.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.417
Beatles. Stones.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.502
- Kinks.
- Your playing days
are over, I'm afraid.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.088
Lucky U.

34:49.297 --> 34:51.090
Sometimes, pointing out
the irony almost feels cheap.

34:51.299 --> 34:52.550
Look...

34:52.759 --> 34:54.135
I can work with you.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.554
Under you.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.473
I've got a great product.

34:58.681 --> 34:59.766
Four hundred years.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.603
What?

35:03.770 --> 35:05.188
Four hundred years.

35:05.396 --> 35:07.732
That's the combined
prison sentence of the guys,

35:07.940 --> 35:10.985
my guys, the district
attorney's office has
convicted.

35:11.194 --> 35:12.987
How do you think they'd feel
if they heard you,

35:13.196 --> 35:14.322
the rat putting them away,

35:14.530 --> 35:15.782
were my new business partner?

35:17.450 --> 35:18.409
Conflicted?

35:20.703 --> 35:22.789
You ever play
<i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>, Blaine?

35:22.997 --> 35:24.957
I'm sorry.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.334
No.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.211
I did.

35:28.419 --> 35:29.879
I was a hell of
a dungeon master.

35:30.088 --> 35:32.465
If players screwed up,
they did something dumb,

35:33.341 --> 35:34.425
they paid the price.

35:35.343 --> 35:36.803
But...

35:37.011 --> 35:38.638
As they were bleeding
out on the battlefield,

35:38.805 --> 35:40.223
there was always
the Hail Mary.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.767
The God call.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.436
That 1% chance that the God
that they worshipped

35:45.645 --> 35:47.230
would come down
from the heavens,

35:47.438 --> 35:49.357
smite their enemies
and save them.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.112
I suggest you make
your God call.

36:12.713 --> 36:13.881
Oh, look.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.008
A hole.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.386
Someone could fall in there.

36:18.594 --> 36:21.389
Here we are. Any last words?

36:21.597 --> 36:24.350
I gave you a run
for your money, didn't I?

36:24.559 --> 36:25.852
I had you on the...

36:34.819 --> 36:36.362
There's your
second-place prize.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.327
Well, God?

36:47.623 --> 36:48.583
I think we're good.

36:56.883 --> 36:59.302
One more signature
should do the trick.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.761
Are you totally sure
about this?

37:00.970 --> 37:02.054
Last chance to back out.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.812
You are now officially
the owner of Positivity.

37:10.021 --> 37:11.480
Feel free to paint it black.

37:11.689 --> 37:12.982
Here is your earnest money.

37:13.191 --> 37:15.818
I will not fire any of
Leslie's employees.

37:16.027 --> 37:18.321
But I might have to
put them through
insensitivity training.

37:18.529 --> 37:19.989
My cab's here.

37:20.198 --> 37:21.199
You're not gonna drink
your coffee?

37:22.325 --> 37:24.160
Not really a coffee fan.

37:24.368 --> 37:25.912
I'm more about art.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.707
Imagining something and then
creating it out of thin air.

37:33.169 --> 37:34.670
You're a talented girl,
all right.

37:34.879 --> 37:36.255
<i>Au revoir</i>, everyone!

37:36.464 --> 37:37.757
Send postcards from Paree!

37:39.759 --> 37:41.594
You ain't foolin' anyone,
you know?

38:09.997 --> 38:13.167
<i>What is it Cher said?
''Love makes you stupid.''</i>

38:13.376 --> 38:16.337
<i>With every passing hour,
Leslie's impossibly
upbeat brain</i>

38:16.545 --> 38:18.297
<i>has less control over me</i>

38:18.506 --> 38:21.550
<i>and I'm able to see
how naive I've been
about Drake.</i>

38:21.759 --> 38:24.929
<i>Does this mean I'm in love,
or does it mean I'm dimwitted?</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:28.349
<i>Or is it the fact
that even as I get
back to my old self,</i>

38:28.557 --> 38:29.976
<i>I'm still giddy about
him showing up</i>

38:30.184 --> 38:31.519
<i>that makes me an idiot?</i>

38:35.231 --> 38:37.149
Hey! You.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.734
Got a couple minutes
for a doomed man?

38:39.568 --> 38:41.404
Um... Sure.

38:41.612 --> 38:42.989
I've been
thinking a lot about death
and whatnot.

38:43.197 --> 38:46.075
And I keep thinking about,
you know, what if,

38:46.284 --> 38:48.369
if I just, out of the blue,
bit the big one.

38:50.246 --> 38:51.872
There are things
that I've done.

38:52.957 --> 38:54.208
Things that...

38:54.417 --> 38:55.626
Things that someone
needs to know about.

38:58.129 --> 38:59.297
Okay.

38:59.505 --> 39:00.965
Look, last year,
I was upset with you

39:01.173 --> 39:03.092
'cause you didn't trust me
with your big secret.

39:03.301 --> 39:05.678
I was just afraid of what you
might do with the information.

39:05.886 --> 39:06.887
Right, see, I get that now.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.180
I mean, more
than you can know.

39:10.016 --> 39:12.101
So here it is.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.270
Listen, Major, there's
something that I've been
meaning to tell you, too.

39:14.478 --> 39:15.563
Uh...

39:18.274 --> 39:19.400
Oh!

39:19.608 --> 39:20.776
Major, this is my
roommate Gilda.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.695
Gilda, this is Major.

39:22.903 --> 39:24.989
How weird that it took
this long for you to
finally meet?

39:25.990 --> 39:27.158
Yeah. Weird.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.332
I've certainly heard
a lot about you.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.833
Nice to finally meet you
in person.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.046
I'm sure it won't be
the last time.

39:40.254 --> 39:41.839
Hmm. Ugh!

39:42.048 --> 39:43.174
What a day.

39:43.382 --> 39:44.425
I'm gonna go take a shower.

39:47.970 --> 39:51.682
I'm so sorry, Major.
I was gonna tell you
I'm expecting company.

39:51.891 --> 39:53.559
Could we talk some other time?

39:53.768 --> 39:55.019
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.687
You know,
I should've called.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.647
So, I'm...

39:58.856 --> 39:59.774
- All right.
- Night, Major.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.150
Yeah, yeah, night, Liv.

40:02.318 --> 40:03.277
Night, Rita.

40:09.867 --> 40:10.826
Rita?

40:36.852 --> 40:40.940
So, Gilda, or Rita,
or whatever the hell
your name is.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.234
How many pictures of Major
did I have around the house?

40:43.442 --> 40:45.528
Did you hunt him down
on Tinder using a phony name?

40:45.736 --> 40:46.862
Or... No.

40:47.071 --> 40:48.030
You knew he was a trainer.

40:48.239 --> 40:49.407
That's how you found him?

40:49.615 --> 40:51.158
Those lingerie shots
that you sent him,

40:51.367 --> 40:53.702
when you knew your texts
were already tearing me up.

40:53.911 --> 40:54.829
Was that part of the fun?

40:55.037 --> 40:56.122
- I...
- You know what?

40:56.330 --> 40:58.332
I don't wanna hear
your side of it.

40:58.541 --> 41:01.585
You're a sick bitch
and I just want you out now.

41:01.794 --> 41:03.045
Because at midnight,
I'm gonna hunt down

41:03.254 --> 41:05.631
anything you left behind
and burn it.

41:07.383 --> 41:08.342
Candy!

41:09.385 --> 41:11.429
Candy, have you seen Blaine?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.847
He's been ignoring
my texts all day.

41:13.055 --> 41:14.557
He knows that I have
abandonment issues.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.187
Oh, damn!

41:22.231 --> 41:23.732
Girls, binoculars up.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.402
It's not quite mating season,

41:26.610 --> 41:28.279
so we might not see any pairs.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.698
But if you keep
your eyes open,
you might get lucky.

41:33.868 --> 41:34.869
Oh! Oh!

41:35.077 --> 41:36.912
There's one over there.
You see it?

41:37.121 --> 41:38.831
The yellow belly...

41:42.626 --> 41:44.420
No. Look!

41:44.628 --> 41:47.423
It flew over there.
Three branches down
from the top left.
